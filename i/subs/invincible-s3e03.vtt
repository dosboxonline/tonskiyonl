You and your pals can keep
everything else.

That's not how this works.

15:35.685 --> 15:37.686
You are now a member of The Order

15:42.233 --> 15:45.527
Even if I agreed with you, which I don't,

this was a private vendetta.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.741
Multi-Paul got himself into this mess,

16:12.764 --> 16:14.973
Or they replace you with the next guy.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.266
Their guy.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.643
And he does it.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.896
And you, me, and your family
are all six feet under.

16:20.897 --> 16:23.732
We just got the East Side under control.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.818
The last thing we need is the kind of heat

16:25.819 --> 16:28.821
that breaking out Multi-Paul
is gonna bring down on us.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.823
We don't have a choice.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.574
And I can't teleport him out of there.

16:32.575 --> 16:34.952
They got a energy field up or something.

16:34.953 --> 16:37.579
Hmm.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.958
Maybe Machine Head knew a thing or two.

16:40.959 --> 16:45.003
Okay, tell Liu I'll take care of it
this one time.

16:45.004 --> 16:49.883
But then I don't want to see
his fucked-up face in my city again.

16:49.884 --> 16:52.636
I mean, I ain't gonna tell him that, but--

16:52.637 --> 16:55.181
- [growls]
- You got it, boss.

17:08.236 --> 17:09.570
[Oliver] Wait up!

17:09.571 --> 17:11.531
Whoa! Whoa!

17:12.657 --> 17:15.367
Come on, you can do better than that.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.618
It's not fair.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.288
You're way faster.

17:21.332 --> 17:24.251
Hey, I said we'd start training.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.795
I didn't say it was gonna be easy.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.839
When are you gonna teach me how to fight?

17:28.840 --> 17:31.508
I've been practicing stuff
I saw on the Internet.

17:31.509 --> 17:33.343
[grunting]

17:33.344 --> 17:35.012
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

17:35.013 --> 17:36.430
One thing at a time.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.890
Flying first.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.641
Fighting second.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.644
You'd better keep up,
we don't want to be late.

17:43.104 --> 17:45.105
Late for what? [whimpers]

17:45.106 --> 17:46.732
Wait up!

17:46.733 --> 17:48.818
[lighthearted jazz playing]

17:53.031 --> 17:55.240
[Oliver] This is so awesome.

17:55.241 --> 17:56.992
Remember our deal.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.452
[Oliver] I know, I know.

17:58.453 --> 18:00.871
No using my powers
in public without permission.

18:00.872 --> 18:02.539
That's right.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.249
Thanks again for doing this, Art.

18:04.250 --> 18:06.293
Eh, it's my pleasure.

18:06.294 --> 18:08.253
I'm glad to finally meet the little guy.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.379
[Oliver] All right.

18:09.380 --> 18:11.548
Get ready, because...

18:11.549 --> 18:15.053
...Kid Omni-Man is here!

18:17.472 --> 18:19.014
Oh, geez.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.642
He told me the "O" was for "Oliver."

18:21.643 --> 18:23.977
[sighs] Can you give us a minute?

18:23.978 --> 18:26.105
Yeah, of course.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.069
You don't like it?

18:32.070 --> 18:33.737
Costume's great.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.073
It's the name that's the problem.

18:36.074 --> 18:38.200
- Why?
- [Mark sighs]

18:38.201 --> 18:41.036
People are gonna hear that name
or see that symbol

18:41.037 --> 18:42.329
and think of Dad.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.456
I know, it'll be great.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.083
Oliver...

18:46.084 --> 18:49.127
Dad did terrible things here.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.338
Things people aren't gonna forget
anytime soon.

18:51.339 --> 18:54.049
But you said he's different now.

18:54.050 --> 18:57.719
And when I save people in this costume,
they'll get it.

18:57.720 --> 19:00.180
It's more complicated than that.

19:00.181 --> 19:02.641
It's gonna take a long time

19:02.642 --> 19:05.102
and a lot of work
for everyone to forgive him.

19:05.103 --> 19:08.564
Maybe someday that might happen.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.566
But we're not there yet.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.234
Not even close.

19:12.235 --> 19:13.695
Do you understand?

19:15.697 --> 19:17.322
I think so.

19:17.323 --> 19:20.325
Word on the street is,
you cut ties with Cecil.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.869
Yeah.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.620
It's time for a change.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.372
In more ways than one.

19:25.373 --> 19:26.623
What's this?

19:26.624 --> 19:29.043
A fresh start.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.384
Whoa!

19:41.097 --> 19:43.348
You look amazing!

19:43.349 --> 19:44.683
I don't know.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.184
Feels a little serious?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.687
[newscaster] <i>We interrupt
our afternoon classics with breaking news</i>

19:48.688 --> 19:50.772
<i>of an attack at Payton Penitentiary.</i>

19:50.773 --> 19:54.776
<i>Early reports indicate
superpowered individuals are involved.</i>

19:54.777 --> 19:57.529
Oh, man, this is perfect.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.615
We can try out our new suits.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.033
Okay.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.035
You can come along, but--

20:03.036 --> 20:05.120
I know, I know. I won't fight.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.414
I'll just watch.
Let's go already, we're gonna miss it.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.374
Hey, say thank you to Art.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.500
Thank you, Art.

20:10.501 --> 20:12.170
- It's a pleasure.
- [grunts]

20:14.631 --> 20:17.342
He has no idea where we're going.

20:18.635 --> 20:19.927
[laughs]

20:19.928 --> 20:23.598
Reminds me of another kid I knew.

20:24.599 --> 20:27.392
[alarm blaring]

20:27.393 --> 20:29.312
It's about time.

20:30.939 --> 20:31.939
[shouts]

20:31.940 --> 20:33.815
[Kursk] Look at these fools.

20:33.816 --> 20:36.818
Their weapons are like tiny tickles.

20:36.819 --> 20:39.529
Their body armor is thin,

20:39.530 --> 20:42.158
- like cheap toilet paper.
- [Furnace] Yeah!

20:43.242 --> 20:45.661
Whoa, who are those guys?

20:45.662 --> 20:46.995
That's Kursk.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.747
He's got electricity powers.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.457
The other guy's Furnace.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.918
Inside that suit
I think he's made of lava or something.

20:52.919 --> 20:54.378
I've fought them before.

20:54.379 --> 20:56.380
Then let's go get 'em, Mark.

20:56.381 --> 20:58.423
- Whoa. H-Hold on.
- Huh?

20:58.424 --> 21:00.300
First, when we're out in public,

21:00.301 --> 21:02.761
you got to call me Invincible, not Mark.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.973
And you can call me Kid Omni--

21:06.099 --> 21:09.017
Wait, I haven't figured out
a new name yet.

21:09.018 --> 21:11.728
That's fine,
because I'm not calling you anything

21:11.729 --> 21:14.147
because you're just gonna stay here

21:14.148 --> 21:15.858
and watch.

21:16.859 --> 21:18.652
[guards shout]

21:18.653 --> 21:19.736
Those guys need help.

21:19.737 --> 21:22.823
Oliv... Kid... Oh, my... Just stop!

21:22.824 --> 21:24.200
[grunts]

21:25.535 --> 21:28.996
Furnace, is raining boy!

21:28.997 --> 21:31.249
[grunting]

21:33.001 --> 21:34.002
Aah!

21:38.798 --> 21:40.257
Leave him alone!

21:40.258 --> 21:43.094
[grunting]

21:51.436 --> 21:52.978
[shouts]

21:52.979 --> 21:54.396
[grunts]

21:54.397 --> 21:57.025
[screaming]

21:58.693 --> 22:00.778
Oliver, are you okay?

22:02.155 --> 22:03.530
[grunts]

22:03.531 --> 22:05.574
I thought we weren't supposed
to use our real names.

22:05.575 --> 22:07.909
Oh, thank God.

22:07.910 --> 22:10.495
You didn't save one for me?

22:10.496 --> 22:12.748
Are you kidding me?

22:12.749 --> 22:14.958
I told you to just watch.

22:14.959 --> 22:16.418
You almost got yourself killed!

22:16.419 --> 22:17.586
I'm fine.

22:17.587 --> 22:18.962
It barely hurt.

22:18.963 --> 22:21.423
Don't ever do that again.

22:21.424 --> 22:22.466
But those guys--

22:22.467 --> 22:24.259
I don't want to hear it.
You either listen

22:24.260 --> 22:26.720
or you go home.

22:26.721 --> 22:28.138
Got it?

22:28.139 --> 22:30.266
Okay, sorry.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.269
Sorry.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.939
[laughter, indistinct chatter]

22:37.982 --> 22:39.275
[Debbie] Thank you.

22:40.318 --> 22:42.611
Like this?

22:42.612 --> 22:43.779
Mm-hmm.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.322
Then smell it.

22:45.323 --> 22:46.948
Mm. [inhales]

22:46.949 --> 22:48.617
Now taste.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.577
Mmm.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.162
You should get

22:52.163 --> 22:53.955
black currant,

22:53.956 --> 22:55.749
dark cherry,

22:55.750 --> 22:57.626
uh, wet earth.

22:57.627 --> 22:59.127
Mmm.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.879
That's amazing.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.464
How'd you learn all this?

23:02.465 --> 23:05.175
Nolan and I did a lot of wine touring.

23:05.176 --> 23:07.428
You know, before...

23:08.763 --> 23:12.015
Benefits of being married
to a travel writer, I suppose.

23:12.016 --> 23:14.352
Yes, exactly.

23:15.686 --> 23:16.853
What?

23:16.854 --> 23:19.815
You're just so full of surprises.

23:19.816 --> 23:22.609
Liking wine is hardly a surprise.

23:22.610 --> 23:24.569
I just... after our last date,

23:24.570 --> 23:26.947
I didn't think I was getting another.

23:26.948 --> 23:28.990
Oh. Oh, Paul,

23:28.991 --> 23:30.951
I'm sorry.

23:30.952 --> 23:32.786
I didn't mean to make you feel that way.

23:32.787 --> 23:35.705
It wasn't you. It was just...

23:35.706 --> 23:37.415
a lot.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.917
No, it's fine.

23:38.918 --> 23:41.461
I-I thought maybe
you weren't ready to date again,

23:41.462 --> 23:43.171
which would have been understandable,

23:43.172 --> 23:45.633
what with everything
you've been going through and...

23:47.426 --> 23:50.471
Paul, I want to be here tonight.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.306
[exhales]

23:53.307 --> 23:56.143
I appreciate you being honest with me.

23:56.144 --> 23:57.519
Oh.

23:57.520 --> 23:59.354
- Of course.
- Mm.

23:59.355 --> 24:00.856
Ooh!

24:00.857 --> 24:02.607
There's that wet earth.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.902
[laughs] Ooh, mmm.

24:06.362 --> 24:08.238
- Paul?
- Debbie?

24:08.239 --> 24:10.282
[sighs]

24:10.283 --> 24:12.951
We've known each other for years.

24:12.952 --> 24:15.745
But... you don't know me.

24:15.746 --> 24:18.915
Not really. And I don't want to lie to you

24:18.916 --> 24:20.834
like Nolan lied to me.

24:20.835 --> 24:22.460
I...

24:22.461 --> 24:24.171
uh...

24:24.172 --> 24:26.131
Okay.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.676
Nolan wasn't a travel writer.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.096
And he's not dead.

24:41.063 --> 24:44.149
So all that stuff in Chicago,

24:44.150 --> 24:46.234
that was Nolan and Mark?

24:46.235 --> 24:47.611
Yes.

24:47.612 --> 24:49.070
And the new kid is from...

24:49.071 --> 24:50.447
Another planet.

24:50.448 --> 24:51.990
[distant laughter]

24:51.991 --> 24:55.410
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner.

24:55.411 --> 24:58.663
No, it's just, I, uh...

24:58.664 --> 25:00.541
Maybe I should go.

25:01.626 --> 25:03.793
Wh-What? Why?

25:03.794 --> 25:09.049
Well, Debbie, I'm-I'm just a normal guy
with thinning hair and a bad back.

25:09.050 --> 25:13.428
I-I can't fly. I can barely jog.

25:13.429 --> 25:15.639
You don't want to waste your time
with someone like me.

25:15.640 --> 25:19.392
Paul, you're so much more than that.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.353
You're smart and kind,

25:21.354 --> 25:24.064
and you pretend to like wine
that tastes like dirt.

25:24.065 --> 25:27.150
And... I like your hair.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.152
- Really?
- Really.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.029
[distant glasses clink]

25:31.030 --> 25:33.490
[Debbie] Mmm.

25:33.491 --> 25:35.533
[Eve] <i>This is a normal family.</i>

25:35.534 --> 25:38.203
<i>[sighs] You used to say that all the time</i>

25:38.204 --> 25:40.747
when I was a kid.

25:40.748 --> 25:43.208
But we both know it's not true.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.835
- It was never true.
- [Adam groans softly]

25:45.836 --> 25:48.088
I know my powers make you uncomfortable.

25:48.089 --> 25:50.465
Sometimes...

25:50.466 --> 25:52.926
they make me uncomfortable, too.

25:52.927 --> 25:55.971
But they're part of me
and they always will be.

25:55.972 --> 25:59.767
So I'm asking you to finally accept that.

26:00.810 --> 26:04.354
So, this is how it's gonna be?

26:04.355 --> 26:06.481
You have powers

26:06.482 --> 26:10.735
so you think you can just deliver
ultimatums to your parents?

26:10.736 --> 26:13.154
No, Dad, but...

26:13.155 --> 26:16.574
if you can accept
your daughter has powers,

26:16.575 --> 26:19.954
I can accept that you don't want me
to use them in the house.

26:21.080 --> 26:25.083
But that doesn't mean
I'm gonna stop using them to help people.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.711
- Hmm.
- I want us to have a relationship

26:27.712 --> 26:32.842
because I love you both
and I know that you love me, too.

26:34.218 --> 26:36.970
But you have to accept me for who I am.

26:36.971 --> 26:39.055
All of me.

26:39.056 --> 26:40.890
Otherwise...

26:40.891 --> 26:42.726
I'm not gonna see you anymore.

26:42.727 --> 26:44.477
[Betsy gasps]

26:44.478 --> 26:48.690
I am tired of feeling like a freak
and a failure every time I come home,

26:48.691 --> 26:50.233
and I don't deserve it.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.903
- Samantha--
- I am serious.

26:53.988 --> 26:57.407
That is the deal.
I won't use my powers in the house,

26:57.408 --> 27:00.577
and you won't make me feel bad
for being who I am.
