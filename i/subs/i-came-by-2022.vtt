of the future.

want their only son to be a doctor.

13:39.416 --> 13:40.625
So it wouldn't work.

13:43.541 --> 13:46.666

as your parents don't share your vision,

13:58.125 --> 13:59.500
That's what parents do.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.541

So maybe it's time we took a good look
at ourselves as individuals,

14:38.875 --> 14:41.000
and maybe took
a little bit of responsibility,

14:41.083 --> 14:44.208
because real change
must come from the ground up.

Public places. You know what I mean?

to the establishment?

If so, isn't that the point
of the graffiti movement?

Solved the world's problems, have we?

16:57.333 --> 16:59.500
Cool. Okay. I gotta go now.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.875
Wait. Where?

17:01.958 --> 17:02.791
Out.

17:02.875 --> 17:06.666
Well, can you tidy the kitchen
before you go? It's a disaster in there.

17:07.375 --> 17:10.583
-I'll clean it when I get back.
-Don't get too wasted!

17:11.291 --> 17:12.666

21:37.000 --> 21:39.833
Call yourself a policeman?
I thought you guys were meant to be fit.

21:39.916 --> 21:43.083
[chuckles] I barely leave my desk
these days. I don't need to be fit.

21:43.166 --> 21:44.916
-Do you want a breather?
-Yes, please.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.416
-All right, all right.
-Aah.

21:46.500 --> 21:47.875
-Aah.
-[both panting]

21:55.875 --> 21:58.666

less glued to her phone than you are.

21:58.750 --> 21:59.875
[sighs]

22:04.375 --> 22:05.208
I've gotta go.

22:06.541 --> 22:08.583
-What happened?
-It's an alarm.

22:09.541 --> 22:11.625
Want me to send officers round to check?

22:11.708 --> 22:13.875
No, no, no.
It's just a fire alarm at home.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.625
So, uh… I better go and see to it.
I'll make it up to you.

22:16.708 --> 22:18.250
Okay. Keep me posted.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.375

26:16.833 --> 26:17.875
Hi, William.

26:18.375 --> 26:21.666
Thanks for calling. No, no, it's fine.
No, it was just a false alarm.

26:21.750 --> 26:24.958
[chuckles] You know, just some sort
of gremlin in the works, and…

26:33.083 --> 26:35.583
-Yeah, technology's too clever by half.
-[door clicks]

26:35.666 --> 26:36.708
[William chuckles]

26:37.291 --> 26:38.250
Hold on.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.166
[William] Hello?

26:42.083 --> 26:43.041
Hello?

26:44.833 --> 26:46.000
Hello? Hector?

26:47.166 --> 26:48.000
You okay?

26:48.500 --> 26:50.000
No, it's all good. Yeah.

26:50.625 --> 26:54.041
Look, I'm sorry again about tonight,
but, um… same time next week?

26:54.666 --> 26:56.166
[door closes]

26:57.166 --> 26:58.958

27:00.083 --> 27:01.750
-[man] Why have you come?
-[woman] Shh!

27:01.833 --> 27:03.625
-[man] Please leave.
-[Naz] Let's sit and talk.

27:03.708 --> 27:05.875
[man] Talk? I give you an education,
and this is how…

27:05.958 --> 27:07.500
-[Naz] We're a family.
-Never come again.

27:07.583 --> 27:08.750
-[Naz] I'm not going.
-Just go.

27:08.833 --> 27:11.666
-[Naz] No, I don't want to go.
-You broke our family!

27:11.750 --> 27:12.833
-Get out.
-Mum, what is this?

27:12.916 --> 27:14.000
[mum] Take your stuff.

27:14.083 --> 27:16.250
-You have to go. Get out of my sight!
-Hey!

27:16.333 --> 27:17.916
-[Naz] Please!
-[dad] Take your stuff. Go.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.416
-Shame on you!
-Come on, she's pregnant!

27:20.500 --> 27:23.416
[dad] And you!
You've ruined her life. Take her!

27:23.500 --> 27:26.041
-[mum sobbing]
-[dad] Let's go. Just calm down…

27:26.125 --> 27:28.041
-[mum] My daughter…
-[dad] Please…

27:28.541 --> 27:30.541
[parents arguing]

27:31.375 --> 27:32.958
[dad] Don't worry. Don't worry.

27:33.041 --> 27:35.041
-[mum] I don't want…
-[dad] Please!

27:37.166 --> 27:38.541

27:39.125 --> 27:40.875
[Jay] Come on. Come on.

[Toby] Jesus.

27:48.666 --> 27:49.583
[Jay] Toby?

27:52.666 --> 27:54.208
[Toby] I need to talk to you.

27:56.041 --> 28:00.166
Babes, um… why don't you go inside
and I'll be there in a sec?

28:00.750 --> 28:01.583
Yeah.

28:09.750 --> 28:10.750
[door closes]

28:10.833 --> 28:12.166
Mate, now is not a good time.

28:12.250 --> 28:14.375
-Naz told her parents about the pregnancy…
-Please, Jay.

28:14.458 --> 28:16.916
Something bad has happened
and I don't know what to do, man.

28:17.000 --> 28:20.916
[panting] I broke into that judge's house.
The guy you flagged months ago.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.500
-Nah, nah, nah. I don't want…
-And when I got in there, I saw…

28:23.583 --> 28:25.166
-I don't want…
-I don't know what I saw.

28:25.250 --> 28:26.583
-Will you just listen to me?
-No.

28:26.666 --> 28:29.416
[Jay] No, you listen to me.
I don't wanna hear this.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.583
No need to go mental. We said
if I wanted to keep writin', I could.

28:32.666 --> 28:35.458
Yes! Yes.
And I told you to keep me out of it.

28:38.250 --> 28:42.958
Look, whatever mess you got yourself in,
yeah, it's not my problem.

28:45.708 --> 28:46.750
You're on your own.

28:49.416 --> 28:50.708
Jay. Oh…

-[scoffs]

29:10.708 --> 29:12.125

-Police.

30:05.958 --> 30:08.416
Oh jeez. Hey, what's goin' on, fellas?

30:08.500 --> 30:11.125
Oh jeez, man. Nothin', man.
We're just hangin' out and stuff.

30:11.208 --> 30:12.500
I hear that. Oh jeez.

30:12.583 --> 30:15.291
I'm supposed to be figurin' out
who robbed the store across the street.

30:15.375 --> 30:16.875
-But, oh jeez, I don't know.
-[chuckles]

30:16.958 --> 30:19.666
Oh jeez, man, that sucks
that your Rick's makin' you do that.

30:19.750 --> 30:20.875
He's not my Rick.

30:20.958 --> 30:23.250
-[banging]
-He's my partner. Oh jeez.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.791
Well, maybe the uniform
makes a big difference.

30:25.875 --> 30:26.750
Who am I to say?

30:26.833 --> 30:29.375
-[banging]
-To me, you just look like a sidekick.

30:29.458 --> 30:32.000
Call me a sidekick one more time!
Call me a sidekick!

30:32.083 --> 30:34.458
-Come on! Oh jeez.
-Do you wanna see how I paint a wall?

30:34.541 --> 30:36.500
-It was the Mortytown Locos, man.
-[laughs]

30:36.583 --> 30:38.041
The Mortytown Locos. Oh!

30:38.125 --> 30:39.125
-[Morty wails]
-[banging]

30:39.208 --> 30:41.500
-[Rick] Know how many codes you violated?
-[doorbell buzzes]

30:41.583 --> 30:44.041
[cop Morty] Oh jeez, Rick,
what do I know about knowin' stuff?

30:44.125 --> 30:45.458
Get in the fuckin' car.

30:45.541 --> 30:46.791
-[Rick] More…
-[doorbell rings]

30:46.875 --> 30:48.875
[police radio chatter]

31:00.791 --> 31:02.750
Officers, what can I do for you?

31:02.833 --> 31:04.791
-Sir Hector Blake?
-Yes.

31:04.875 --> 31:06.000
Mind if we come in?

31:06.083 --> 31:08.458
[TV continues in distance]

31:09.000 --> 31:11.125
[Rick] That's how you run a Citadel.

31:11.208 --> 31:12.875
[crowd yelling on TV]

31:12.958 --> 31:14.916
If you wouldn't mind
taking your shoes off.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.916
[Rick] …soaring, while Rick
satisfaction levels are plummeting

31:18.000 --> 31:20.416
The divide between the two groups
has never been wider.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.666
-Solve that one real quick.
-[crowd jeers]

31:23.666 --> 31:26.541
[Hector laughs] Oh, please.
That's patently absurd.

31:27.041 --> 31:30.708
Surely it's a bored teenager playing
a sick joke. Too much time on their hands.

31:30.791 --> 31:34.000
Might anyone have cause to target you
with an accusation like this?

31:34.083 --> 31:36.958
I was a judge,
so, yes, one or two people! [laughs]

31:37.041 --> 31:38.750
Can I get you a coffee, officers?

31:38.833 --> 31:40.416
-Uh, no, thank you.
-[male officer] Yeah.

31:40.500 --> 31:41.875
-[Hector] Mmm!
-[man] Thank you.

31:41.958 --> 31:43.916
-[Hector] How do you take it?
-[man] White, please.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.958
-Is there anyone else living here, sir?
-[scraping]

31:46.041 --> 31:47.958
[Hector] No, only me.

31:50.041 --> 31:52.083
[Hector] Please do look around.

32:02.791 --> 32:06.625
[Rick] I'm Rick D. Sanchez III,
owner of this here wafer establishment,

32:06.708 --> 32:08.583
and I say that the Rick in there is right!

32:08.666 --> 32:10.750
-[banging]
-He's more Rick than any of you.

32:10.833 --> 32:12.250
Is there a basement
in this property?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.333
-Yes.
-[woman] Do you mind if we have a look?

32:18.500 --> 32:20.458
I must tell William, William Roy,

32:21.041 --> 32:24.500
how diligent his officers are
in responding to crank calls. [chuckles]

32:25.166 --> 32:27.750
I'm sure he wouldn't think
it was a waste of police time.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.166
He's your superintendent, isn't he?

32:30.875 --> 32:33.625
Good squash player.
Keeps me on my toes, anyway.

32:33.708 --> 32:35.916
[Rick D. Sanchez III] …with walking
the fuck out of here.

32:36.000 --> 32:37.458

32:54.416 --> 32:57.541
[Hector] I completely understand,
officers. You're just doing your job.

32:58.125 --> 32:59.583
Appreciate it. Thank you, sir.

33:00.208 --> 33:01.708
No, no, no, don't go!

-Toby, open this door!

34:11.125 --> 34:11.958
What?

34:12.500 --> 34:13.750
The mess in the kitchen.

34:13.833 --> 34:15.458
Why is it still there?

34:15.541 --> 34:19.916
-Mum, honestly, I had such a shit day.
-Oh, really? Doing what exactly?

34:22.083 --> 34:23.166
Fuck off.

34:23.791 --> 34:24.958
Excuse me?

34:27.208 --> 34:30.208
-Where do you think you're going?
-Anywhere but here.

34:30.291 --> 34:32.375
Because I can't listen
to this shit right now.

34:32.458 --> 34:37.083
No. No, right now, you get in there
and you clean that kitchen.

34:37.166 --> 34:39.916
You know, it didn't
just miraculously tidy itself yesterday,

34:40.000 --> 34:41.916
or the day before, or the day before that!

34:42.000 --> 34:45.041
Thank you, Mother, for tidying up
after me. I appreciate what you do.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.125
Do you know what? Give me those keys.

34:47.208 --> 34:50.250
What? What are you doin'?
How am I supposed to get back in?

34:50.333 --> 34:52.458
You can come back
when you show me some respect

34:52.541 --> 34:55.083
and stop using my front door
like a cat flap.

34:55.166 --> 34:57.541
Your front door?
Dad was the one who bought this place.

34:57.625 --> 34:59.541
I don't recall
you doing anything to earn it.

35:03.041 --> 35:05.041
[both breathing heavily]

35:07.000 --> 35:09.583
[quietly] Toby… I didn't…

35:09.666 --> 35:13.708
Why don't you give me the money he left
for me, and I'll duck out of here happily?

35:15.958 --> 35:17.166
It's my money, Mum!

35:17.875 --> 35:20.708
I've told you. You're not ready
to handle that kind of cash.

35:20.791 --> 35:23.750
I'm twenty-fucking-three!
You need to let me get on with my life!

35:23.833 --> 35:27.666
Precisely. You're 23,
and what have you achieved?

35:27.750 --> 35:29.875
You've given up on
everything you've ever started.

35:29.958 --> 35:34.333
Music, art college, uni. You can't
hold down a job for longer than a week.

35:34.916 --> 35:38.916
I work with kids every day
that are so much worse off than you are,

35:39.000 --> 35:42.583
but they're all
desperately fighting for something.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.041
And you, you…

35:46.041 --> 35:47.333
[sighs]

35:50.000 --> 35:51.916
You've got no idea what I'm fightin' for.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.583
[dish clatters]

35:55.541 --> 35:57.000
Don't wait for me to come back.

37:11.375 --> 37:12.250
Don't worry.

37:13.333 --> 37:14.583
I'm here to help you.

37:15.291 --> 37:16.708
But we don't have much time.

37:16.791 --> 37:18.000
[man whimpers]

37:21.791 --> 37:23.125
[Toby grunts] Okay.

38:06.208 --> 38:08.791

38:12.958 --> 38:13.875
Look at me.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.750

-I'm gettin' you out of here, okay?

You've wet yourself, have you?

[man croaks]

39:36.625 --> 39:38.750
[Hector] This keeps on happening,
doesn't it?

39:39.250 --> 39:40.541
-Hmm?
-[man whimpers]

39:42.541 --> 39:46.250
[Hector] Well, I'm not going to clear
it up. You're going to clear it up.

39:47.875 --> 39:48.916
Hm?

39:50.291 --> 39:51.583

41:33.250 --> 41:36.375
[woman on TV 2] This is, uh…
my celebration of being different.

41:36.458 --> 41:38.250
I mean, that is just amazing.

41:38.333 --> 41:43.000
And the rice paper offshoots
are just so beautifully done.

41:43.083 --> 41:45.583
Look at the tiny little letters
and numbers.

41:45.666 --> 41:47.250
[Paul Hollywood] I love it. It reminds me

41:47.333 --> 41:49.958
of something
from, um, the cartoon Yellow Submarine.

41:50.708 --> 41:52.708
[Prue Leith] I've never seen
a cake anything like it.

41:52.791 --> 41:55.125
I don't think any of us have ever seen
a cake like that.

41:55.208 --> 41:57.333
[Paul] I'd have that on my 40th any day.

41:57.416 --> 41:59.416
When it eventually comes round.

42:21.583 --> 42:24.250
[mum] Yeah, I've been calling him.
His phone's dead.

42:26.083 --> 42:28.458
Can you just let me know
if he gets in touch, please?

42:28.541 --> 42:30.166
[man] Yeah…

42:32.000 --> 42:32.875
Thanks.

42:34.500 --> 42:35.416
[hangs up]

42:35.500 --> 42:36.500
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:36.583 --> 42:38.125
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

42:39.333 --> 42:43.000
I've been calling round all his friends
to see if anyone's heard from him.

42:43.083 --> 42:45.125
Oh, yeah? Didn't know he had any.

42:46.625 --> 42:47.583
Sorry.

42:48.708 --> 42:50.708
[police radio chatter]

42:55.000 --> 42:55.875
[mum] Uh…

42:56.458 --> 42:57.291
This is, um…

42:58.125 --> 43:00.916
-I'm so sorry.
-Detective Sergeant Ella Lloyd.

43:01.000 --> 43:04.000
Jameel Agassi. Jay.
I'm one of Toby's mates.

43:09.583 --> 43:14.125
As it's been over 72 hours
since anyone last saw or heard from Toby,

43:14.208 --> 43:16.208
we will treat this
as a missing persons case.

43:17.833 --> 43:21.333
Now, do you have any reason to believe
Toby could be in any danger?

43:22.250 --> 43:25.541
No. He's a good kid. I mean, I…

43:26.416 --> 43:27.958
I think he's just trying to punish me.

43:28.041 --> 43:30.666
Like I said,
we argued before he stormed out.

43:31.166 --> 43:32.916
You didn't say what you argued about.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.166
[footsteps upstairs]

43:34.250 --> 43:36.750
What we always argue about.
Money, his dad.

43:37.833 --> 43:39.750
-And where's his father?
-Dead.

43:40.458 --> 43:41.583
I mean, he was old.

43:41.666 --> 43:44.583
He was never really around, anyway.
Toby barely knew him.

43:50.500 --> 43:52.250
When was the last time you saw him?

43:53.750 --> 43:55.833
I don't know. Months ago, maybe.

43:58.666 --> 44:02.416
Ms. Nealey says you two are best mates.
Almost like brothers.

44:02.500 --> 44:04.041
Yeah. We are.

44:04.541 --> 44:07.500
Not seeing your best mate for months
doesn't sound too friendly to me.

44:07.583 --> 44:12.166
Yeah. I've got a baby on the way,
so I've just been a bit, um… distracted.

44:13.916 --> 44:14.916
[radio chatter]

44:16.083 --> 44:17.000
[Ella] Right.

44:17.083 --> 44:22.041
Well, we have a recent photo of Toby,
and you have my details.

44:22.125 --> 44:26.000
I'll be your point of contact, so if you
think of anything else, notify me.

44:26.083 --> 44:27.916
-[mum] Thank you.
-[Ella] I'll see myself out.

44:40.083 --> 44:41.583
You know something, don't you?

44:42.708 --> 44:43.583
No.

44:46.791 --> 44:47.625
No.

-Yo, Tobes…
-[laughs] Got ya!

44:56.791 --> 44:58.833
[roars] Leave a message!

44:58.916 --> 45:00.833
I can't promise I'll get back to you.

45:01.500 --> 45:02.708
[bleep]

45:02.791 --> 45:03.750
Yo, Tobes.

45:04.833 --> 45:06.291

45:06.875 --> 45:08.666

Oh, fuck.

46:53.500 --> 46:55.333
-Open up.
-[sighs]

46:56.833 --> 46:59.083
Oh, come on, man. What is this?

47:00.000 --> 47:02.041
I told you,
I've been driving round all night.

47:02.125 --> 47:03.791
I'm just trying to get some rest.

47:09.666 --> 47:12.250
Guess you lot ain't used to seeing
Black fellas round these ends.

47:12.333 --> 47:14.291
[laughs] Don't try that shit with me.

47:15.541 --> 47:17.125
[man] Do you wanna explain this?

47:28.166 --> 47:30.208
Jameel Benjamin Agassi.

47:34.125 --> 47:35.875
[sighs]

47:42.083 --> 47:47.083
-July 2018, vandalism.
-It was an empty building.

47:47.166 --> 47:48.583
It was private property.

[scoffs]

47:52.333 --> 47:53.541

47:54.625 --> 47:55.708
June 2020.

47:56.500 --> 47:58.750
Arrested at a protest at Westminster

47:58.833 --> 48:01.375
for not complying
with the Public Order Act.

48:02.208 --> 48:03.791
You served six weeks in prison.

48:09.166 --> 48:11.625
And now you're in possession
of an illegal substance.

48:11.708 --> 48:14.375
Come on, man.
It was a butt end of a spliff.

48:14.458 --> 48:16.333
Which is a serious offense.

48:17.333 --> 48:19.416
Especially for someone with priors.

48:22.166 --> 48:23.041
Okay.

48:25.291 --> 48:26.125
I'm sorry.

48:27.250 --> 48:30.083
It's just my missus,
she's seven months pregnant, and…

48:30.958 --> 48:32.666
I'm working 14-hour days, and…

48:33.708 --> 48:35.541
[sighs] I ain't slept properly in months.

48:36.125 --> 48:39.791
I had a little smoke.
So I was just trying to get my head down.

48:41.041 --> 48:42.083
[snorts]

48:44.041 --> 48:45.458
I'm sure you know how that is.

49:38.458 --> 49:40.333
Jesus, Jay. What the hell?

49:40.416 --> 49:44.625
I'm sorry, Liz. I… I did knock, but you
didn't hear, so I just used my key.

49:45.708 --> 49:48.125
[sobs] I thought he'd come home.

49:48.208 --> 49:50.666
Shit. Sorry, Liz, I should've thought.

49:54.750 --> 49:59.125
I keep waiting for him to walk through
the door, but he's not coming back, is he?

49:59.208 --> 50:02.250
I don't wanna hear that.
This is classic Toby.

50:04.708 --> 50:06.208
Sorry. [sniffles]

50:07.291 --> 50:10.333
I took some Diazepam
and it's making me a bit fuzzy.

50:13.583 --> 50:15.291
How are you doing? How's Naz?

50:15.375 --> 50:16.541
Yeah, good.

50:17.166 --> 50:18.333
She's gettin' big.

50:18.416 --> 50:19.416
Is she?

50:19.500 --> 50:20.583
Wow.

50:22.250 --> 50:24.333
Can't believe that I'm gonna be a dad.

50:24.958 --> 50:25.916
[sighs]

50:26.000 --> 50:27.750
I'm shitting it, if I'm honest.

50:28.291 --> 50:30.291
You're gonna be an amazing father.

50:33.833 --> 50:34.666
God.

50:35.791 --> 50:37.708
Looks like a bomb's gone off
in this place.

50:37.791 --> 50:39.833
Oh, to be fair, some of it was me.

50:39.916 --> 50:43.250
I've turned the place upside down.
I don't even know what I'm looking for.

50:43.791 --> 50:45.333
Have you looked in his secret stash?

50:46.458 --> 50:47.291
His what?

50:47.375 --> 50:50.708
I was just about to look in it,
just in case there was any clues.

50:52.750 --> 50:54.458
[rattling]

51:04.666 --> 51:06.541
[gasps and sobs]

51:13.333 --> 51:15.666
By the way, I didn't wanna
mention this to DS Lloyd,

51:15.750 --> 51:18.750
because, well…
I didn't know what she'd find.

51:19.625 --> 51:20.875
[sniffles]

51:23.791 --> 51:25.250
Sir Hector Blake?

51:30.875 --> 51:35.666
"In support of the environment, our alumni
newsletter will go digital next month."

51:36.416 --> 51:39.125
-What is this? Why has he got this?
-[snorts] I dunno.

51:40.083 --> 51:44.583
Why would he have a letter addressed to
some old Birlstonian hidden in his room?

51:45.333 --> 51:49.083
I've looked him up, this Hector Blake.
He's an ex-judge.

51:49.166 --> 51:51.625
I can't imagine
Toby ever met him in his life.

51:55.583 --> 51:56.625
[door closes]

51:58.375 --> 52:00.750
What? What are you looking for?

52:06.500 --> 52:09.625
Jesus, can you just say something?
I'm losing my mind here.

52:12.333 --> 52:13.375
Sorry.

52:14.125 --> 52:17.250
I'm glad you brought this
to my attention. I'll be following it up.

52:19.166 --> 52:22.041
Well, what does that mean?
Who is this man?

52:22.125 --> 52:24.166
Miss. Nealey, I suggest you go home,

52:25.041 --> 52:26.291
and wait for my call.

52:31.333 --> 52:35.166
That live trace we've got on Toby Nealey's
phone. What was the last known location?

52:35.250 --> 52:37.250
[male officer] Uh… Pitt Road.

52:37.333 --> 52:38.625
Why?

52:38.708 --> 52:41.916
The mother found this in Toby's bedroom,
addressed to Sir Hector Blake,

52:42.000 --> 52:43.416
who lives on the same road.

52:43.500 --> 52:45.458
We got a call in last week
from a young man

52:45.541 --> 52:47.583
reporting that someone
was being held captive

52:47.666 --> 52:49.625
in the basement of the same address.

52:49.708 --> 52:51.000
You think that was Toby Nealey.

52:51.875 --> 52:53.875
[Ella] That's what we're gonna find out.

52:56.875 --> 52:58.333
[buzzer sounds]

52:59.208 --> 53:02.916
Sir Hector Blake? I'm DS Ella Lloyd.
Can we step inside, please, for a chat?

53:03.500 --> 53:05.166
What's this about? I was on my way out.

53:05.250 --> 53:09.416
Sir, I have grounds to believe the life of
a person on these premises is in danger.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.375
[sighs] Not that again.

53:12.083 --> 53:14.708
Under Section 17
of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act,

53:14.791 --> 53:17.000
we need to come inside
and search your property.

53:17.500 --> 53:21.083
I'm sure I don't need to explain
Section 17 to someone of your stature.

53:21.583 --> 53:22.875
Please take off your shoes.

53:32.750 --> 53:36.083
Are you really looking
for an endangered person in there?

53:38.375 --> 53:41.583
-I'd like to have a look at your basement.
-This way, Sarge.

53:41.666 --> 53:43.375
[man on radio] …division.

53:43.458 --> 53:45.458
Is any officer able to go to…

53:46.500 --> 53:47.625
[door opens]

53:47.708 --> 53:49.333
[lights blinking]

53:51.833 --> 53:53.208
This is my workshop.

53:56.458 --> 53:57.541
Workshop for what?

53:58.083 --> 54:02.875
My wife used to be a ceramicist. I took up
pottery to help me feel closer to her.

54:03.958 --> 54:05.041
Where's your wife?

54:05.541 --> 54:06.958
Chesham House.

54:08.125 --> 54:09.750
-The psychiatric hospital?
-Yes.

54:10.416 --> 54:11.250
Yes.

54:25.208 --> 54:27.125
I didn't say I made all of them.

54:27.208 --> 54:28.250
[laughs]

54:28.333 --> 54:31.125
All right, all right. You got me, officer.
Am I under arrest?

54:33.208 --> 54:34.458
[sniffs]

54:50.208 --> 54:52.375
Is there a door behind this shelving unit?

54:57.250 --> 54:58.208
Open it, please.

55:00.250 --> 55:01.375
[exhales]

55:06.958 --> 55:08.333
[lock clanks]

55:08.416 --> 55:09.791
[door grating]

55:27.791 --> 55:29.333
-It's my panic room.
-[gasps]

55:47.041 --> 55:48.166
Hmm.

55:57.708 --> 56:00.375
This peephole's
on the outside of the door, looking in.

56:02.250 --> 56:04.625
Must be a builder's mistake. [chuckles]

56:05.375 --> 56:07.666
Ah, I'd never noticed that before.

56:07.750 --> 56:10.625
Is that all you got?
You looked like one of the smart ones.

56:12.541 --> 56:14.000
-What did you say?
-Hm?

56:14.833 --> 56:15.791
Hector Blake,

56:16.958 --> 56:19.583
I'm arresting you
for obstructing an officer…

56:19.666 --> 56:20.541
Oh, come on.

56:20.625 --> 56:21.791
…in the execution of her duty.

56:21.875 --> 56:23.750
-What?
-You do not have to say anything.

56:23.833 --> 56:25.791
But it may harm your defense
if you do not…

56:34.708 --> 56:35.708
Cuffs to the front.

56:42.708 --> 56:44.208
[starts engine]

56:52.375 --> 56:54.166
[radio chatter]

57:04.583 --> 57:06.166
Thank you very much.

57:06.250 --> 57:07.958
-Don't worry.
-It's all a misunderstanding.

57:08.041 --> 57:10.625
[Hector] No, it's fine.
I know she's doing her job.

57:10.708 --> 57:13.125
-[William] She's very keen.
-[Hector] I'm sure.

57:13.208 --> 57:14.500
-I'll sort it out.
-Of course.

57:14.583 --> 57:17.333
-We're gonna play…
-Next week, Wednesday. Usual.

57:17.416 --> 57:19.166
-Wednesday. Okay. Yeah.
-Okay. Yeah.

57:42.500 --> 57:43.666
[vibrating]

57:45.875 --> 57:46.833
Yes?

57:52.750 --> 57:54.625
So, that's it? You're done?

58:02.125 --> 58:03.666
-[kicks door]
-[roaring sound]

58:11.750 --> 58:13.416
[Faisal] Aren't you gonna ask
how I did it?

58:20.791 --> 58:22.416
How did you do it?

58:24.833 --> 58:26.791
I mixed a bunch of sleeping pills

58:28.625 --> 58:30.250
and downed them with vodka.

58:32.791 --> 58:35.583
And then I woke up in a hospital.

58:38.000 --> 58:39.958
Apparently, I didn't get the dosage right.

58:43.208 --> 58:44.833
You're studying medicine.

58:44.916 --> 58:47.708
Shouldn't you know
how many pills it takes to kill yourself?

58:50.500 --> 58:51.375
Faisal…

58:53.125 --> 58:53.958
Look.

58:56.291 --> 58:58.416
Maybe you didn't really want to die.

59:00.541 --> 59:01.916
Maybe your suicide attempt

59:02.000 --> 59:05.250
was a declaration
of how much you actually want to live.

59:06.583 --> 59:11.208
Your way of telling your parents
what you can't seem to say in words.

59:14.416 --> 59:15.250
No.

59:17.791 --> 59:19.166
I wanted to die.

59:21.458 --> 59:24.458
I wanted my parents
to understand that they'd failed me.

59:35.875 --> 59:36.916
Are you okay?

59:44.291 --> 59:46.291
[sobbing]

59:54.041 --> 59:55.291
[sighs]

1:00:08.458 --> 1:00:09.833
[whimpers]

1:00:35.583 --> 1:00:36.458
[sighs]

1:00:36.541 --> 1:00:37.458
[beep]

1:01:52.375 --> 1:01:54.333
Have you heard from your family at all?

1:01:54.416 --> 1:01:58.166
I spoke with my sister a few days ago,
but nothing from my parents.

1:01:58.916 --> 1:02:00.625
Where are they again? Tehran?

1:02:01.125 --> 1:02:05.083
No, Gorgan.
It's, like, a small town, north of Iran.

1:02:05.166 --> 1:02:06.041
[Hector] Oh.

1:02:06.125 --> 1:02:09.250
And my sister, she is in Tehran,
and she tells me how they are.

1:02:11.250 --> 1:02:12.875
You don't speak with your parents?

1:02:15.125 --> 1:02:16.333
They've disowned me.

1:02:17.125 --> 1:02:18.500
-Really? Why?
-[sighs]

1:02:19.125 --> 1:02:20.833
Because of who I am, I guess.

1:02:21.750 --> 1:02:23.041
Oh God. I'm sorry.

1:02:24.416 --> 1:02:27.166
-As if living in exile wasn't hard enough.
-[chuckles]

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:29.750
I'm just happy to be alive, you know?

1:02:29.833 --> 1:02:31.000
Hmm.

1:02:34.666 --> 1:02:36.625
So, how come you're able to work?

1:02:39.208 --> 1:02:40.875
I'm not doing anything illegal.

1:02:40.958 --> 1:02:43.583
No, no, no. I wasn't suggesting
for a second that you were.

1:02:43.666 --> 1:02:46.125
They rejected my application
first time round.

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:50.833
I mean, look, I'm not sure
what more evidence they need.

1:02:51.583 --> 1:02:53.666
Me kissing a guy in front of them?
[chuckles]

1:02:54.166 --> 1:02:58.166
So I appealed, and now I don't know
what's happened to my case.

1:02:59.250 --> 1:03:01.666
It's been such a long wait
that I'm eligible to work.

1:03:01.750 --> 1:03:04.916
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean
to make you feel uncomfortable.

1:03:05.416 --> 1:03:07.708
-I need to survive.
-Sure.

1:03:09.333 --> 1:03:11.666
It's nice getting to know you
a little bit better.

1:03:13.958 --> 1:03:15.333
Maybe I could help you,

1:03:16.666 --> 1:03:18.791
if you'd like to discuss it further?

1:03:24.500 --> 1:03:25.916
What time do you finish?

1:03:29.083 --> 1:03:31.083
[vehicle approaching]

1:03:40.875 --> 1:03:42.291
[car door opens]

1:03:42.916 --> 1:03:44.333

1:03:54.375 --> 1:03:55.833
-[Hector] You found me.
-[gate creaks]

1:03:56.916 --> 1:03:58.291
-Come in.
-I like your gate.

1:03:58.375 --> 1:03:59.916
-Very nice.
-[Hector] Yeah, it is, yeah.

1:04:00.458 --> 1:04:01.333
-Come in.
-Yes.

1:04:01.416 --> 1:04:02.291
[gate clangs shut]

1:04:05.250 --> 1:04:07.458
-Let me hang up your coat.
-Thank you.

1:04:09.291 --> 1:04:11.625
If you wouldn't mind
taking off your shoes.

1:04:11.708 --> 1:04:12.791
Mm-hm.

1:04:19.333 --> 1:04:22.583
-[Hector] Can I get you a drink?
-Sure, if you're having one.

1:04:22.666 --> 1:04:25.250
Uh, please don't say beer.
I don't have beer.

1:04:25.958 --> 1:04:27.666
Whatever you want. [laughs]

1:04:27.750 --> 1:04:31.708
-Then you'll join me in a gin and tonic.
-Sure. You know best.

1:04:31.791 --> 1:04:35.000
[Hector chuckles] I tell you what,
why don't you put on a record?

1:04:35.083 --> 1:04:37.625
My vinyl's in that,
uh, cupboard over there.

1:04:37.708 --> 1:04:40.208
-It's so old it's back in fashion.
-[both chuckle]

[Miniature Overture
from The Nutcracker by Tchaikovsky]

1:05:01.750 --> 1:05:03.291
You enjoy classical music.

1:05:04.250 --> 1:05:08.458
Uh, no. This one has a cool cover,
like a Disney film.

1:05:08.541 --> 1:05:09.416
[both laugh]

1:05:09.500 --> 1:05:11.208
Sweet! Here.

1:05:13.916 --> 1:05:16.416
Shall I play you my favorite piece
from this record?

1:05:19.833 --> 1:05:22.958
[Pas de Deux: Andante maestoso
from Act II of The Nutcracker]

1:05:23.041 --> 1:05:24.125
It's my father.

1:05:24.208 --> 1:05:27.500
You must love him so much
to put his picture up like that.

1:05:27.583 --> 1:05:28.541
[Hector laughs]

1:05:28.625 --> 1:05:32.791
Well, I'm not sure about love.
It's more complex than that.

1:05:32.875 --> 1:05:34.208
[pats sofa]

1:05:35.166 --> 1:05:36.708
But, like it or not,

1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.083
he made me the man I am today.

1:05:40.166 --> 1:05:41.208
I'm sure he's proud.

1:05:41.708 --> 1:05:42.625
Oh, I doubt it.

1:05:43.625 --> 1:05:46.041
I'm sure he's very disappointed
that I resigned.

1:05:46.541 --> 1:05:48.083
Well, why did you do that?

1:05:49.041 --> 1:05:53.000
Didn't want to live according
to his plans anymore, and I was bored.

1:05:54.125 --> 1:05:57.125
But I feel he can still see me
through that picture,

1:05:57.208 --> 1:05:58.833
even though he's long gone.

1:05:58.916 --> 1:06:02.750
So you keep that painting up
to show him your middle finger every day?

1:06:02.833 --> 1:06:03.791
[laughs]

1:06:03.875 --> 1:06:04.791
Pretty much.

1:06:04.875 --> 1:06:06.500
[both laugh]

1:06:06.583 --> 1:06:09.000
He thought I was
going to be prime minister.

1:06:12.666 --> 1:06:14.375
I didn't even want to read law.

1:06:18.583 --> 1:06:20.625
No, he didn't care much
for me or my mother.

1:06:20.708 --> 1:06:21.583
Oh.

1:06:22.083 --> 1:06:22.916
I'm sorry.

1:06:24.500 --> 1:06:26.166
We had a young Parsi helper.

1:06:26.916 --> 1:06:28.541
Oh. Persian, like me.

1:06:28.625 --> 1:06:29.958
Indian Persian.

1:06:31.125 --> 1:06:33.458
His name was Ravi.
Quite a handsome young man.

1:06:33.541 --> 1:06:37.791
He'd moved over here to make money
to provide for his family back in India.

1:06:37.875 --> 1:06:40.708
My father came across him
working in his factory,

1:06:40.791 --> 1:06:42.625
and decided
to take him under his wing.

1:06:42.708 --> 1:06:44.500
Very kind. Very charitable.

1:06:45.958 --> 1:06:48.416
And then he invited him
to live in our house,

1:06:49.625 --> 1:06:51.333
like a member of the family.

1:06:53.166 --> 1:06:56.333
And eventually,
he invited him into his bed.

1:06:59.083 --> 1:07:01.875
My poor mother
was banished to the guest room.

1:07:03.958 --> 1:07:06.458
And not long after, she took her own life.

1:07:08.833 --> 1:07:14.583
And I was the little boy who found her
with her wrists sliced open.

1:07:15.625 --> 1:07:17.083
-Oh my God.
-Yeah.

1:07:18.875 --> 1:07:22.083
Well, there… there wasn't
much consolation from my father.

1:07:22.166 --> 1:07:24.708
In fact, he sent me away
to boarding school.

1:07:24.791 --> 1:07:26.500
I didn't care. I was quite happy there.

1:07:26.583 --> 1:07:29.833
In fact, it was better
to be away from him and that boy.

1:07:30.416 --> 1:07:32.041
I hated that boy so much.

1:07:32.750 --> 1:07:35.583
To think that he replaced
my mother and me.

1:07:36.541 --> 1:07:39.875
Living in our house,
eating our food, breathing our air.

1:07:40.708 --> 1:07:43.708
That… peasant.

1:07:44.291 --> 1:07:47.291
Okay, that sounds kind of racist.

1:07:47.375 --> 1:07:50.208
No. No, not at all, no.
If you knew anything about my career,

1:07:50.291 --> 1:07:52.000
you'd know I'm anything but racist.

1:07:54.250 --> 1:07:57.291
I really tried to be kind to him.
I really tried.

1:07:59.375 --> 1:08:03.208
But I had this rage inside of me

1:08:03.791 --> 1:08:06.333
that was very hard to suppress.

1:08:08.708 --> 1:08:10.791
Well, maybe he was just a victim.

1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:15.291
Maybe he was forced
to be in that situation by your dad.

1:08:17.541 --> 1:08:19.125
Everyone has a choice.

1:08:19.958 --> 1:08:21.250
[music swells]

1:08:21.333 --> 1:08:23.708
Not when you're poor with nowhere to go.

1:08:43.125 --> 1:08:45.125
Anyway, that's all in the past.

1:08:49.708 --> 1:08:53.708
I only share this story
with very special people like you.

1:08:59.708 --> 1:09:02.208
Do you want to know what happened to Ravi?

1:09:12.083 --> 1:09:15.333
Sorry. Can I use the bathroom first?

1:09:18.708 --> 1:09:19.541
Sure.

-Where are my shoes?

1:09:58.583 --> 1:10:00.000
Oh, you don't look so good.

1:10:00.625 --> 1:10:02.166
-No…
-Come and sit down.

1:10:02.250 --> 1:10:04.833
No. No, no, no.
I think I really should go.

1:10:04.916 --> 1:10:08.125
It's okay. Just take a moment
and you can go.

1:10:08.208 --> 1:10:10.416
Maybe you drank that too quickly.

[record crackling]

1:10:19.208 --> 1:10:21.000
Can I have some water, please?

1:10:24.166 --> 1:10:25.208
Sure.

1:10:32.041 --> 1:10:33.541
[gasps] So, what…

1:10:35.041 --> 1:10:36.083
What happened to Ravi?

1:10:36.958 --> 1:10:37.916
[chuckles]

1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:39.583
[echoing] I thought I'd killed him.

1:10:40.916 --> 1:10:46.166
One summer when I came back from school,
I pounced on him like a savage beast.

1:10:47.208 --> 1:10:48.666
Nearly destroyed his face.

1:10:48.750 --> 1:10:52.375
It was so liberating, so empowering.

1:10:52.458 --> 1:10:53.416
Hmm.

1:10:53.916 --> 1:10:56.250
Almost transcendental.

1:11:01.791 --> 1:11:03.791
[gasping]

1:11:17.125 --> 1:11:18.458
[groans]

1:11:19.250 --> 1:11:20.333
[grunts]

1:11:22.083 --> 1:11:22.916
Hey!

1:11:33.041 --> 1:11:34.333
[yells]

1:11:36.583 --> 1:11:40.666
Race, religion, sexual orientation,
and transgender identity.

1:11:41.333 --> 1:11:44.958
Now, currently, there is a widely held
view among many in the legal profession,

1:11:45.041 --> 1:11:48.416
myself included,
that these sections of society

1:11:48.500 --> 1:11:51.708
are not protected
by the criminal justice system equally…

1:11:51.791 --> 1:11:53.125
-[gasps]
-Sorry, sorry, sorry!

1:11:53.208 --> 1:11:57.375
Bloody hell, Jay! Stop doing that or I'm
gonna have to take those keys back.

1:11:57.458 --> 1:11:59.458
Sorry! I knocked and knocked, but…

1:12:00.333 --> 1:12:01.708
I guess you couldn't hear me.

1:12:03.750 --> 1:12:04.750
Are those Toby's?

1:12:06.708 --> 1:12:07.541
[Liz] Yeah.

1:12:13.458 --> 1:12:16.166
Where have you been?
You don't answer my calls.

1:12:16.791 --> 1:12:19.833
I even called your work,
and they said that you're takin' time off.

1:12:25.041 --> 1:12:26.041
Cup of tea?

1:12:30.166 --> 1:12:31.250
[cupboard door opens]

1:12:31.750 --> 1:12:32.875
[shuffling]

1:12:32.958 --> 1:12:33.875
[cupboard door closes]

1:12:34.791 --> 1:12:36.083
[crockery clatters]

1:12:37.291 --> 1:12:39.291
So, tell me, how are you?

1:12:40.916 --> 1:12:42.458
Officially a dad now.

1:12:44.791 --> 1:12:46.458
Really? When?

1:12:47.500 --> 1:12:48.375
A few weeks ago.

1:12:49.708 --> 1:12:53.041
-I'm so sorry. I should've got…
-Oh, no, no, no, no. Don't worry.

1:12:53.125 --> 1:12:54.208
He came out early.

1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.375
I guess my little man
couldn't wait to come out.

1:12:57.875 --> 1:12:59.166
[water boiling]

1:12:59.250 --> 1:13:01.166
-Well, that's amazing.
-[kettle clicks]

1:13:01.250 --> 1:13:02.375
Congratulations.

1:13:06.166 --> 1:13:08.166
[water pouring]

1:13:12.875 --> 1:13:14.500
-What's his name?
-Who?

1:13:15.166 --> 1:13:16.750
-Your baby.
-Oh.

1:13:17.416 --> 1:13:18.250
Aydan.

1:13:19.541 --> 1:13:20.375
Aydan.

1:13:21.041 --> 1:13:21.875
Yeah.

1:13:23.708 --> 1:13:27.500
Well, I'll have to come over and say hello
to baby Aydan, introduce myself.

1:13:28.208 --> 1:13:29.291
Yeah, we'd love that.

1:13:30.333 --> 1:13:34.083
I mean, you're probably the closest thing
to a gran he's ever gonna have.

1:13:36.125 --> 1:13:37.541
[rain falling softly]

1:13:40.791 --> 1:13:41.666
Liz?

1:13:43.208 --> 1:13:44.083
What's that?

1:13:48.583 --> 1:13:50.000
That's Hector Blake.

1:13:52.375 --> 1:13:54.250
He used to be part of the Law Commission,

1:13:54.333 --> 1:13:57.000
championing equality
within the justice system.

1:13:57.500 --> 1:13:58.916
[laughs] Which is a joke.

1:14:02.291 --> 1:14:03.791
But why are you watching it?

1:14:06.083 --> 1:14:07.875
I'm studying him, I suppose.

1:14:09.916 --> 1:14:12.500
Saint Blake is the devil
and nobody sees it.

1:14:12.583 --> 1:14:15.375
I'm sure if that's true,
then the police will find out.

1:14:15.458 --> 1:14:18.083
-[thunder rumbling]
-The police have already given up.

1:14:18.166 --> 1:14:19.500
Maybe because he's clean.

1:14:21.208 --> 1:14:23.083
Maybe because he's connected.

1:14:23.875 --> 1:14:26.833
But obsessing over him online
ain't gonna get you anywhere.

1:14:26.916 --> 1:14:28.291
-[heavy rainfall]
-I know.

1:14:29.166 --> 1:14:32.708
I've been watching him
in the real world too. Not just online.

1:14:33.750 --> 1:14:34.833
You're following him?

1:14:36.416 --> 1:14:38.375
-Oh, Liz…
-I know.

1:14:38.958 --> 1:14:39.958
This is serious.

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:44.541
Last night, I watched a young man
hurl himself from Hector's window.

1:14:45.041 --> 1:14:48.958
You should've seen the state of him.
He was completely incoherent at first.

1:14:49.041 --> 1:14:51.791
He says that Hector invited him back
and spiked his drink.

1:14:52.791 --> 1:14:56.791
He jumped out of a window to get away
from him. Thank God I was there.

1:14:57.583 --> 1:14:59.291
[thunder rumbling]

1:14:59.375 --> 1:15:00.541
Did you go to the police?

1:15:01.666 --> 1:15:02.750
He didn't want to.

1:15:04.125 --> 1:15:07.000
He's an asylum seeker.
He's afraid it will affect his case.

1:15:07.083 --> 1:15:08.708
No, but he has to.

1:15:08.791 --> 1:15:13.166
I know, but I can't push him. I'm trying
to persuade him, but he's scared.

1:15:15.583 --> 1:15:17.708
I think he's right to be scared.

1:15:19.166 --> 1:15:21.125
[thunder rumbling]

1:15:33.666 --> 1:15:34.541
[horn honks]

1:15:37.541 --> 1:15:40.125
-What the fuck do you want?
-I brought your clothes back.

1:15:40.208 --> 1:15:42.458
-I don't want them.
-Can we just talk?

1:15:42.541 --> 1:15:43.791
No. Leave me alone.

1:15:43.875 --> 1:15:47.250
Your application for permanent settlement
in the UK.

1:15:47.791 --> 1:15:50.541
I can stop it or expedite it.
You know I can.

1:15:53.375 --> 1:15:57.625
Look, please just get in the car,
or do I have to shout through a window?

1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:08.541
[door locks]

1:16:13.125 --> 1:16:15.125
[distant phone ringing]

1:16:21.916 --> 1:16:23.833
-[woman] Good afternoon.
-[door opens]

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.791
[man] Please do feel free to return
if you have further questions.

1:16:29.875 --> 1:16:32.166
-Thank you for your time.
-You're welcome.

1:16:35.375 --> 1:16:36.625
-What happened?
-Let's go.

1:16:38.583 --> 1:16:40.000
[door closes]

1:16:41.708 --> 1:16:44.208
He's gone AWOL.
No one can get in touch with him.

1:16:44.291 --> 1:16:45.125
So, what now?

1:16:45.708 --> 1:16:47.458
I can't accept second-hand evidence.

1:16:47.541 --> 1:16:50.500
This young man needs to make a statement
if I need to pursue further.

1:16:50.583 --> 1:16:52.833
But you just said he's gone missing.

1:16:52.916 --> 1:16:55.583
The guy's an asylum seeker.
He could have gone back home.

1:16:55.666 --> 1:16:58.583
The whole point of seeking asylum
is that you can't go back home.

1:16:59.083 --> 1:17:01.583
Isn't your job to protect people?

1:17:01.666 --> 1:17:04.541
It is. And I'm trying
to protect you, Lizzie.

1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:08.041
What were you doing
outside Hector Blake's house anyway?

1:17:09.458 --> 1:17:11.666
I think now I know
how Toby must have felt.

1:17:15.166 --> 1:17:16.750
[banging]

1:17:17.375 --> 1:17:18.958
[gasps]

1:17:19.958 --> 1:17:21.333
[banging]

1:17:22.583 --> 1:17:24.583
[shouting and banging]

1:17:26.875 --> 1:17:29.541
[Omid] Please let me out. Come on!

1:17:33.541 --> 1:17:35.541
[sobbing] Please let me out.

1:17:39.500 --> 1:17:41.583
-[banging]
-Why are you doing this to me?

1:17:44.708 --> 1:17:46.208
Let me out of here!

1:17:52.916 --> 1:17:54.916
[banging and shouting continues]

1:17:55.958 --> 1:17:57.833
Please let me out!

1:18:22.208 --> 1:18:24.000
[gates whirring]

1:18:33.750 --> 1:18:35.750
[gates closing]

1:19:08.416 --> 1:19:09.916
[phone vibrating]

1:19:24.291 --> 1:19:26.250
Hey, Faisal, can I call you back?

1:19:26.750 --> 1:19:30.458
Hi, Lizzie. I just wanted to say
I cracked the USB password.

1:19:31.041 --> 1:19:32.500
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.041
-What's on it?
-I didn't look.

1:19:35.125 --> 1:19:37.416
Client-counselor confidentiality,
you know?

1:19:39.708 --> 1:19:41.208
[baby cooing]

1:19:41.291 --> 1:19:42.125
Hey, babe.

1:19:42.875 --> 1:19:43.833
There he is.

1:19:46.458 --> 1:19:49.416
Ah! Lizzie. It's good to see you.

1:19:49.500 --> 1:19:50.333
You too.

1:19:51.458 --> 1:19:53.541
Look what Lizzie brought for Aydan.

1:19:54.041 --> 1:19:57.041
Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you, Liz.

1:19:57.125 --> 1:20:00.541
You're welcome.
Hopefully, you can use it for a few years.

1:20:02.750 --> 1:20:03.916
Oh!

1:20:04.416 --> 1:20:05.666
Aah.

1:20:05.750 --> 1:20:07.416
Oh, he's such a lovely boy.

1:20:08.125 --> 1:20:10.000
-[Aydan coos]
-[Liz] Oh! Aye.

1:20:10.583 --> 1:20:12.833
-[gurgles]
-I know, you're so lovely!

1:20:12.916 --> 1:20:15.166
Are you also a little bit stinky?

1:20:15.250 --> 1:20:17.833
-[Naz] Oh no.
-Oh! A little bit.

1:20:17.916 --> 1:20:19.083
-A little bit!
-[Naz laughs]

1:20:19.166 --> 1:20:20.708
-Let me just go and change him.
-Aww.

1:20:27.125 --> 1:20:28.250
[door closes]

1:20:31.666 --> 1:20:34.333
So, how are things?

1:20:36.958 --> 1:20:38.541
-[Aydan fussing]
-Liz?

1:20:41.416 --> 1:20:42.666
[gasps]

1:20:47.791 --> 1:20:49.000
We need to talk.

1:20:54.541 --> 1:20:56.541
[front door opens and closes]

1:20:58.125 --> 1:21:02.791
I've been reading up on the "I Came By"
taggers. Isn't that what you call them?

1:21:03.375 --> 1:21:06.833
How they break into rich people's homes
and spray-paint the walls.

1:21:12.625 --> 1:21:14.416
I knew you were hiding something.

1:21:16.125 --> 1:21:17.458
How do you know that's me?

1:21:19.750 --> 1:21:20.750
Jay.

1:21:21.625 --> 1:21:22.458
Look.

1:21:23.250 --> 1:21:24.333
That's you!

1:21:25.916 --> 1:21:26.875
All right.

1:21:28.625 --> 1:21:29.958
What you gonna do with these?

1:21:30.041 --> 1:21:32.583
Did you two
break into Hector Blake's house?

1:21:33.166 --> 1:21:34.000
No.

1:21:34.791 --> 1:21:36.041
[hesitating] No, I didn't.

1:21:36.750 --> 1:21:38.625
[spluttering] No. I swear.

1:21:42.291 --> 1:21:43.708
[dog barking]

1:21:46.250 --> 1:21:47.250
Did you tell Naz?

1:21:49.708 --> 1:21:52.500
She already knows something's up.
I can feel it.

1:21:53.583 --> 1:21:56.250
These photos won't prove shit
in Toby's case, okay?

1:21:56.333 --> 1:21:58.666
It's just gonna come up
and fuck up my life.

1:22:03.333 --> 1:22:05.250
I want you to help me
break into his house.

1:22:05.333 --> 1:22:07.583
What? Hector Blake's?

1:22:07.666 --> 1:22:10.541
I don't know if I can do it on my own.
You've clearly done this before.

1:22:10.625 --> 1:22:12.375
Have you lost your mind?

1:22:12.458 --> 1:22:14.625
Technically, we wouldn't be breaking in.

1:22:14.708 --> 1:22:17.333
We'd be using a key.
I saw him hiding one outside.

1:22:17.416 --> 1:22:18.833
Think about what you're saying.

1:22:18.916 --> 1:22:21.583
Look, you just make sure
I get in all right.

1:22:21.666 --> 1:22:24.375
-You can just stand outside. Keep watch.
-No.

1:22:24.458 --> 1:22:27.416
No way. I can't risk it.
I've got to think about Aydan and Naz.

1:22:28.750 --> 1:22:31.000
Fine. Fine. Then get out.

1:22:31.500 --> 1:22:33.333
-Lizzie, come on.
-Go on. You coward!

1:22:33.416 --> 1:22:34.583
-Look…
-Get out!

1:22:34.666 --> 1:22:36.833
Look, calm down. Just…

1:22:40.500 --> 1:22:41.958
We can't give up on Toby.

1:22:42.041 --> 1:22:43.375
I'm not givin' up on him!

1:22:43.458 --> 1:22:47.666
But, Liz, if I, a Black man, get caught,
I'll go down for years!

1:22:48.541 --> 1:22:49.416
You know that.

1:22:52.125 --> 1:22:53.125
Do it for me.

1:22:57.250 --> 1:22:58.583
You owe me.

1:22:59.875 --> 1:23:02.666
I came through for you
every time you needed me.

1:23:03.250 --> 1:23:07.416
Every time your mum had
one of her new fellas knocking you around.

1:23:08.416 --> 1:23:10.041
When she kicked you out.

1:23:10.791 --> 1:23:14.416
Toby and I have always been there for you.

1:23:16.416 --> 1:23:17.916
You've been family to me.

1:23:19.166 --> 1:23:20.375
Yeah.

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:23.208
But…

1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.208
I can't.

1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:32.208
Just get out.

1:23:39.958 --> 1:23:41.416
[sighs]

1:23:48.666 --> 1:23:50.000
Where's Lizzie?

1:23:50.083 --> 1:23:51.083
She's left.

1:23:51.666 --> 1:23:52.875
Just like that?

1:23:53.666 --> 1:23:54.875
Aydan asleep?

1:23:56.125 --> 1:23:57.583
-What did she want, Jay?
-Hm?

1:24:03.166 --> 1:24:04.250
What did she want?

1:24:05.166 --> 1:24:06.500
She came to see Aydan.

1:24:11.916 --> 1:24:13.333
Do you have any respect for me?

1:24:16.291 --> 1:24:17.583
Of course I do.

1:24:18.625 --> 1:24:20.958
-So, why do you act like I'm stupid?
-[scoffs]

1:24:21.625 --> 1:24:24.958
-Wait, wait, wait…
-You did some work at Hector Blake's home.

1:24:25.041 --> 1:24:28.041
And months later,
Toby shows up at our door, panicked,

1:24:28.125 --> 1:24:29.958
the night before he goes missing.

1:24:30.041 --> 1:24:36.250
Then I hear from Lizzie that Hector Blake
is a suspect in Toby's case.

1:24:37.458 --> 1:24:40.333
-What mess have you got yourself into?
-No, no, no, no, no. No mess.

1:24:40.416 --> 1:24:43.541
Listen, Jay, if I have to be
Aydan's entire family, I bloody will be.

1:24:44.916 --> 1:24:47.791
-Why are you saying that for?
-Because you're scaring me.

1:24:47.875 --> 1:24:51.625
