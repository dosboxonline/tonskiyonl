WEBVTT

02:53.631 --> 02:54.866
Brother Man, we're here

02:55.881 --> 02:57.822
I'm sorry to be such a bother

02:58.352 --> 02:59.764
Don't mention it

03:00.514 --> 03:05.102
This place has been idle for a few months.
I've informed the owners, they are nice folks

03:05.763 --> 03:08.983
Thank you

03:09.469 --> 03:10.748
Is this suitable for your school?

03:18.248 --> 03:19.615
Wow, this place is huge!

03:19.735 --> 03:20.718
Is this ok?

03:20.838 --> 03:21.642
Yes, yes

03:23.994 --> 03:26.215
Very spacious...

03:40.761 --> 03:41.480
Master Yip

03:42.678 --> 03:44.808
You haven't gotten any disciples yet?

03:48.069 --> 03:49.257
What's up, 3rd Aunt?

03:49.377 --> 03:53.033
You have such a big place here.
I'd like to hang my laundry here

03:54.292 --> 03:55.762
Sure, no problem

04:40.794 --> 04:41.640
Yong

04:43.805 --> 04:46.040
Sigh, I told you before... let me do this

04:48.323 --> 04:49.671
I don't know what to do with you

04:50.279 --> 04:52.550
There'll be no more water left by the time you come

04:53.279 --> 04:57.938
Then I'll come back earlier 
next time. Let me do these chores

04:58.914 --> 05:01.737
I've told you not to exert yourself

05:02.278 --> 05:04.879
How are you feeling?

05:06.890 --> 05:09.384
Mama, I need to pay school fees

05:09.660 --> 05:12.366
Ok, hang on

05:18.758 --> 05:19.936
Who's that?

05:20.056 --> 05:21.544
Pay your rent! Mr and Mrs Yip!

05:21.817 --> 05:25.465
Don't open the door. We don't have enough money for rent

05:25.585 --> 05:28.105
Mr and Mrs Yip! Pay your rent

06:05.457 --> 06:10.081
Master Yip, still no students?

06:10.201 --> 06:13.955
I'll go hang my laundry...

06:14.075 --> 06:18.613
Let me help you...

06:18.734 --> 06:25.567
Thank you very much!

06:45.495 --> 06:51.636
Hey, are you the one teaching Wing Chun?

06:52.871 --> 06:57.706
Master Yip! Someone's here to learn kung fu!

07:01.412 --> 07:02.542
You wish to learn Wing Chun?

07:02.662 --> 07:06.212
I don't even know what Wing Chun is

07:06.332 --> 07:10.482
Then let me tell you. Wing Chun is the Southern art of close combat....

07:10.602 --> 07:17.771
Enough! Spar with me. If I lose, I'll be your student

07:19.711 --> 07:21.053
Fine

07:33.158 --> 07:37.499
Wing Chun. Yip Man

07:52.912 --> 07:55.135
So, what do you think?

07:55.255 --> 07:58.735
You haven't won yet

08:23.792 --> 08:25.557
Do you yield?

08:25.677 --> 08:30.321
Yield? I don't even know what you're doing

08:40.626 --> 08:43.238
Do you know now?

08:51.141 --> 08:56.612
Master Yip, I didn't know
you're so skilful! Fantastic!

08:56.732 --> 09:02.858
Hey, young man! You should be his disciple!

09:02.978 --> 09:06.635
I think you can start paying tuition fees now

09:11.611 --> 09:14.646
Hey! How can you leave like that?

09:14.766 --> 09:25.274
Master Yip, what now? Your potential student is gone

09:41.720 --> 09:43.590
That's him

09:44.367 --> 09:46.661
How good can his kung fu be?

09:46.781 --> 09:47.755
Would I lie to you?

09:47.875 --> 09:50.402
He looks like he couldn't even hurt a fly

09:50.756 --> 09:53.250
If you hadn't told me, I'd have 
thought he's just a laundryman

09:54.673 --> 10:00.084
You're not really here to learn kung fu. Please leave

10:00.801 --> 10:04.307
Ok, then we'll fight you

10:04.719 --> 10:06.257
No need to take them off

10:06.377 --> 10:07.916
Why not?

10:08.233 --> 10:09.799
Oh, nevermind

10:12.586 --> 10:13.045
The Yip Man Palm

10:36.680 --> 10:38.868
Told you not to take off your shirts...

10:38.988 --> 10:44.271
Master! I am Huang Liang, please take me as a disciple!

10:54.824 --> 10:58.212
- Master, I am Xiu Shi Chang!
- Wei Guo Jian
- Wang Kun

10:58.332 --> 11:00.012
Please accept us as students!

11:00.132 --> 11:04.617
Eh, I asked first. You must address
me as "Eldest Brother"

11:04.737 --> 11:06.240
Serve tea to Master!

11:06.360 --> 11:08.746
No need to trouble yourselves

11:09.911 --> 11:13.510
Pay tuition fees first

11:18.221 --> 11:22.036
In Wing Chun, we attack and defend in one motion

11:22.156 --> 11:24.838
Attack, and defend

11:24.959 --> 11:27.932
To disable an opponent in the shortest time

11:28.052 --> 11:29.627
This is block and attack

11:30.475 --> 11:31.534
Block and attack

11:32.315 --> 11:35.116
Follow up with a dozen quick punches

11:36.265 --> 11:37.501
Understand?

11:37.621 --> 11:38.813
(Blank looks)

11:41.738 --> 11:44.174
Who is Master Yip?

11:45.600 --> 11:48.531
Master!

11:48.956 --> 11:53.299
Liang, did you ask them to come?

12:14.378 --> 12:18.465
Master, do you think you can fight off 10 men?

12:21.854 --> 12:24.149
The best thing is not to fight at all

12:24.269 --> 12:25.561
Continue training

12:25.681 --> 12:29.763
What if they use weapons?

12:30.222 --> 12:32.164
Run

12:37.531 --> 12:39.756
Time to collect tuition fees

12:40.180 --> 12:41.133
Ok

12:43.075 --> 12:45.724
You always say that

12:46.323 --> 12:48.160
I will collect soon

12:48.774 --> 12:50.787
Hang on a sec

12:50.907 --> 12:52.093
What's up?

12:54.106 --> 12:57.531
It's time to pay tuition fees

12:57.652 --> 12:59.085
What's happening?

12:59.205 --> 13:01.345
Time to pay tuition fees

13:01.577 --> 13:04.170
If you have the money, please pay up

13:04.639 --> 13:07.183
Here you go Master

13:08.168 --> 13:13.174
Master, I can only pay $2... My mother...
she needs the money. I'll pay the rest later

13:13.951 --> 13:18.893
Pay next time... next time

13:19.013 --> 13:20.860
Go home for dinner

13:21.708 --> 13:24.302
Bye Master

13:25.626 --> 13:29.087
It's so little... what shall we do?

13:29.617 --> 13:34.348
No choice. You also know things aren't so good now

13:34.468 --> 13:39.080
The students asked for help, I can't refuse

13:39.200 --> 13:41.904
Then we need to appeal to the landlady

13:42.024 --> 13:48.507
Yes, things will work out eventually

13:49.178 --> 13:52.109
2 pieces of cake please

13:53.224 --> 13:56.579
- You want the egg tarts?
- No, thanks

13:56.699 --> 14:00.851
Stop! Hold it right there!

14:00.971 --> 14:04.840
Thief! Return it to me!

14:05.688 --> 14:08.584
Please don't beat up my dad

14:08.704 --> 14:11.549
No money? Then we'll get him

14:11.669 --> 14:15.469
Please let him go!

14:16.740 --> 14:19.211
Stop, stop! Don't beat him up

14:19.332 --> 14:20.483
What's happening?

14:20.603 --> 14:22.107
He stole our roasted duck

14:22.227 --> 14:23.378
I'll pay for him

14:23.498 --> 14:24.120
Give it here!

14:27.156 --> 14:28.110
Let's go

14:28.230 --> 14:28.696
Jin Quan?

14:28.816 --> 14:30.793
Uncle Man, I know where Dad is

14:31.111 --> 14:32.361
Bring me to him

14:42.375 --> 14:44.565
Here

14:59.671 --> 15:00.236
Jin Quan!

15:00.356 --> 15:03.555
Uncle Man, he doesn't recognise anyone

15:03.978 --> 15:08.074
The Japanese shot him in the head once. He doesn't recognise anyone anymore

15:16.796 --> 15:23.011
Jin Quan, I'm Yip

15:24.789 --> 15:25.303
Jin Quan!

15:25.423 --> 15:30.261
Get away! Get out! Go! Go!

15:52.505 --> 15:56.212
Let's go, Uncle Man

16:00.577 --> 16:05.097
It's my fault. I did this to you

16:11.558 --> 16:12.830
Let's go

16:14.771 --> 16:21.021
My dad hasn't chased me away yet
That's why I'm still here

16:22.646 --> 16:29.954
On good days I can get odd jobs and buy food back

16:30.786 --> 16:34.387
On bad days, we starve

16:38.935 --> 16:42.323
Don't worry, Kwan

16:42.544 --> 16:46.392
I'll help you take care of him

16:47.700 --> 16:49.606
Since you are recommended by
Master Yip, I'll definitely hire you

16:49.727 --> 16:53.984
Kid, if you agree to half salary, you can start now

16:54.105 --> 16:54.867
No problem

16:54.987 --> 16:57.868
Have a seat. I'll arrange work for you

16:57.988 --> 17:00.675
Brother Man, don't leave. I'll treat you to tea

17:01.274 --> 17:01.946
Thank you

17:02.066 --> 17:02.899
Don't mention it

17:03.019 --> 17:04.416
Have a seat

17:04.537 --> 17:06.501
This is good

17:06.621 --> 17:08.054
Thank you Uncle Man

17:08.174 --> 17:11.267
Kwan, you must work hard

17:11.387 --> 17:12.680
I will

17:22.531 --> 17:25.038
What do you think? I can bring you there later

17:25.157 --> 17:28.710
I'm from Hong School. I don't need to learn from you!

17:33.584 --> 17:36.974
Since you aren't interested, why tear my posters down?

17:37.094 --> 17:42.412
I don't care what you learn. You're blocking my poster

17:46.472 --> 17:48.662
Want to know what Wing Chun is?

17:49.120 --> 17:50.250
You're looking for trouble?

17:57.771 --> 17:58.689
We won't bully you

17:58.809 --> 18:00.773
One on one. No helping!

18:00.893 --> 18:01.323
Ok

18:01.443 --> 18:03.068
Also, don't poke eyes

18:03.188 --> 18:05.444
Enough talk. I'm in a hurry

18:54.717 --> 18:55.290
So you yield?

18:55.410 --> 18:56.158
No!

18:56.278 --> 18:56.925
No?

18:57.877 --> 18:58.643
Do you yield?

19:06.287 --> 19:09.036
When you strike, don't move from this line

19:09.828 --> 19:10.901
Relax

19:11.794 --> 19:12.677
Relax more

19:18.404 --> 19:19.726
Who is Yip Man?

19:20.243 --> 19:20.875
Yes?

19:22.082 --> 19:24.007
Your disciple Liang has beaten up our brother

19:24.127 --> 19:28.117
We took him hostage. Bring money to rescue him at the fish market

19:28.864 --> 19:29.668
Let's go

21:00.712 --> 21:01.999
Brother Jin

21:11.478 --> 21:12.967
Are you his Master?

21:13.087 --> 21:14.346
That's right

21:17.915 --> 21:22.089
I believe it's just a misunderstanding

21:22.413 --> 21:23.792
Let's talk it over

21:24.473 --> 21:26.827
Can you release my disciple?

21:26.947 --> 21:27.636
Release him!

21:37.761 --> 21:40.170
Are you all right?

21:41.881 --> 21:43.279
I'm fine

21:43.399 --> 21:45.541
Why did you beat him up?

21:45.661 --> 21:48.869
We sparred and he lost. It's not my fault

21:48.989 --> 21:50.654
What? I can't beat you?

21:50.774 --> 21:52.290
Don't be rash

21:53.076 --> 21:54.886
You're all young men

21:55.006 --> 21:58.650
Sometimes you get minor injuries during sparring

21:58.770 --> 22:02.443
Next time I'll come specially to
clarify things with your Master

22:02.564 --> 22:04.024
May I know who your Master is?

22:04.144 --> 22:08.392
You don't need to know who he is.
He's better than you

22:08.908 --> 22:11.466
Enough talk. Did you bring the money?

22:12.616 --> 22:13.161
No

22:17.673 --> 22:19.167
Don't be rash

22:21.321 --> 22:22.470
Attack!

22:30.602 --> 22:31.579
Behind you!

22:47.121 --> 22:48.845
Chop him up!

23:41.446 --> 23:42.424
Master!

24:40.380 --> 24:41.214
Liang!

24:41.875 --> 24:43.369
Master! I'm here

24:55.291 --> 24:59.113
Master, you really can beat up more than 10 men!

25:00.664 --> 25:02.331
Only if we can escape

25:11.095 --> 25:12.565
Stay close to me

25:16.176 --> 25:17.626
Follow me!

25:54.946 --> 25:56.325
Go, Liang

25:57.216 --> 25:57.992
Go!

26:04.845 --> 26:05.846
Jin Shan Zhao?

26:18.863 --> 26:20.075
Nobody move!

26:21.722 --> 26:23.347
What are you doing?

26:28.288 --> 26:31.019
Master Yip, you are free to go

26:39.109 --> 26:40.145
Thanks

26:42.594 --> 26:43.570
You're asking for it!

26:45.148 --> 26:46.924
Break it up!

26:56.737 --> 26:57.785
Master!

27:03.002 --> 27:04.026
You stirring up trouble again?

27:04.146 --> 27:05.686
No, Master

27:05.922 --> 27:09.347
I was sparring with him, but he brought
his Master here to intimidate us

27:12.895 --> 27:13.555
Ji

27:15.297 --> 27:16.580
You trying to be Big Brother here?

27:16.700 --> 27:17.639
No of course not

27:18.345 --> 27:21.276
Big Brother Hong, let's talk things over

27:22.183 --> 27:24.279
You want to talk with a knife in your hand?

27:24.561 --> 27:25.338
No, no

27:25.832 --> 27:29.846
That son of a bitch tried to cause
trouble on my turf. That's why I was....

27:30.287 --> 27:32.072
This isn't your turf

27:32.192 --> 27:39.078
This is my road. Your patch of ground is mine.
So you tell me, whose turf is this?

27:41.929 --> 27:43.934
It's yours, of course

27:44.054 --> 27:47.244
You can leave now. It's not your concern

28:01.993 --> 28:04.570
Which style and school are you?

28:05.045 --> 28:09.339
Greetings Master Hong. I'm Yip Man
of the Wing Chun sect from Fo Shan

28:10.501 --> 28:14.619
The situation is like this. My disciple sparred with yours

28:15.244 --> 28:18.486
My disciple definitely went too far and injured your disciple

28:18.839 --> 28:20.839
You're saying my Hong style is inferior?

28:20.959 --> 28:22.909
I didn't mean it like that

28:23.591 --> 28:26.321
Who allowed you to teach martial arts? Do you know the rules?

28:26.662 --> 28:27.955
I don't know of any rules

28:28.075 --> 28:30.951
Ok I'll tell you the rules now

28:31.448 --> 28:34.371
You must accept challenges from the various schools

28:34.491 --> 28:38.893
If you win, then you are fit to teach martial arts

28:43.226 --> 28:47.013
So now you know the rules for opening a martial arts school

28:54.641 --> 29:00.845
Enough talk. There are rules for martial
arts schools, and then there are rules of Law

29:01.280 --> 29:02.721
Now that you're done

29:02.841 --> 29:05.809
Wan, Po! Take these 2 into custody

29:05.929 --> 29:07.603
I have a spare set of handcuffs. Arrest him too

29:07.723 --> 29:08.558
Huh? Me too?

29:08.679 --> 29:09.250
Master!

29:09.617 --> 29:10.927
Stop squirming! Let's go

29:13.115 --> 29:14.615
Move it

29:15.982 --> 29:19.630
Settle your affairs, and let's go in. The Chief is waiting

29:28.781 --> 29:29.649
Sir

30:00.834 --> 30:03.376
The Chief is asking about the manpower and security arrangements

30:04.458 --> 30:06.207
Everything is arranged. No problems

30:08.761 --> 30:11.925
So how much will I get for the competition?

30:15.321 --> 30:17.802
Please excuse us a moment

30:19.449 --> 30:22.155
Don't worry, I'll take care of it

30:30.972 --> 30:34.630
So how much is his cut? You
tell me, I'll tell Master Hong

30:48.041 --> 30:49.758
Speak!

30:49.878 --> 30:51.088
Are you going to tell me?

30:51.112 --> 30:54.370
Don't worry. These cops are just strutting around acting tough

30:55.569 --> 30:57.533
It'll be ok once we make bail

31:00.368 --> 31:04.109
Master Jin, I'm sorry to get you involved

31:05.686 --> 31:07.408
I'm sorry to get you involved today

31:07.528 --> 31:08.078
Hang on a bit

31:08.561 --> 31:11.125
I'm deaf in this ear after you wacked me there the other time

31:11.245 --> 31:11.843
So what were you saying?

31:11.963 --> 31:15.455
I said, I'm sorry to get you involved today

31:15.818 --> 31:16.689
It's nothing

31:17.006 --> 31:22.229
If it weren't for your wake up call the other time
I don't know what I'll do here in Hong Kong

31:24.547 --> 31:27.500
Open up, Police!

31:28.610 --> 31:30.505
Open up!

31:32.445 --> 31:33.551
What's wrong?

31:33.672 --> 31:34.892
Any of Yip Man's relatives here?

31:35.012 --> 31:36.021
I'm his wife

31:36.597 --> 31:39.432
Your husband is arrested for fighting

31:39.552 --> 31:41.456
Bring money to bail him out

31:49.142 --> 31:52.588
Mr Liang! Mr Liang!

31:54.070 --> 31:54.905
Mr Liang!

31:55.281 --> 31:56.328
What's wrong, Mrs Yip?

31:56.449 --> 32:02.036
Please save my husband! I don't
have enough money for bail

32:03.988 --> 32:06.059
Wait here

32:06.422 --> 32:09.892
It's very troublesome to open
a martial arts school here in Hong Kong

32:10.386 --> 32:12.445
There's too many schools, too many masters

32:12.810 --> 32:13.868
Too many rules too

32:14.327 --> 32:16.586
And that Master Hong has many supporters

32:16.706 --> 32:18.451
Many disciples, and a lot of money

32:19.357 --> 32:24.533
So what? I'll get him once I'm out of here

32:25.198 --> 32:28.921
I'll destroy his fish stall and poison all his fish!

32:31.121 --> 32:34.039
What's the difference between you and them, then?

32:34.415 --> 32:39.003
Hey kid, you fight pretty good

32:40.191 --> 32:41.638
I'm not a kid!

32:41.855 --> 32:43.101
Which part of me looks like a kid?

32:43.125 --> 32:45.189
Liang! Don't use that tone

32:45.483 --> 32:46.553
Master Jin is your elder

32:46.578 --> 32:48.424
It's all right, he's young

32:49.573 --> 32:52.726
He reminds me of myself when I was young

32:53.055 --> 32:55.632
If you want him to turn out well, get him a wife

32:55.926 --> 33:00.975
Just like me... wife, kids, family. It changes a man

33:08.358 --> 33:10.147
I want to post bail for my husband

33:10.370 --> 33:11.558
What's his name?

33:11.679 --> 33:12.641
Yip Man

33:13.935 --> 33:15.112
Did you bring the money?

33:15.232 --> 33:16.300
Yes, here

33:18.159 --> 33:22.088
Yip Man, you're free to go

33:27.447 --> 33:28.882
Hurry up

33:47.531 --> 33:49.049
I'm here to bail Jin out

33:49.367 --> 33:50.519
Wife!

33:50.837 --> 33:53.061
Brother, please open the door

33:53.181 --> 33:55.037
Quickly!

33:57.490 --> 33:58.890
That's my wife

34:07.222 --> 34:11.599
Liang, is anyone coming for you?

34:13.139 --> 34:14.175
No

34:20.183 --> 34:25.382
Don't worry Master. They'll release
me in a couple of days

34:25.924 --> 34:27.159
You go on

34:28.827 --> 34:30.616
I won't be able to see you out

34:42.683 --> 34:45.754
Brother Geng, I need to impose on you again

34:46.165 --> 34:48.165
I want to bail my disciple out

34:49.393 --> 34:50.946
Is it ok?

34:52.851 --> 34:55.380
Brother Man, I didn't bring enough money

34:55.937 --> 34:56.772
Master Yip

34:57.737 --> 35:00.078
Master Yip, wait a bit

35:00.843 --> 35:03.007
Wife, do you have any money?

35:03.231 --> 35:04.607
What do you need it for?

35:05.325 --> 35:06.618
It's an emergency

35:06.983 --> 35:09.053
You're always like this. No money!

35:09.619 --> 35:11.901
Help people out here, Wife

35:13.489 --> 35:14.878
This is the last time

35:15.313 --> 35:16.959
Mum's the best!

35:17.659 --> 35:19.941
Master Yip, here's the money

35:21.145 --> 35:23.181
I'll return it to you as soon as I can. Thank you

35:23.204 --> 35:23.934
No problem, don't mention it

35:34.505 --> 35:40.007
It's so difficult to open a school here.
Why don't you just give up?

35:46.443 --> 35:51.184
I'll just have to go visit the other masters. It's nothing

35:52.642 --> 35:55.823
I don't want to worry every day like before

36:04.596 --> 36:10.407
We made it through the war,
there's nothing to worry about

36:12.595 --> 36:19.064
Don't dwell on it. Go to sleep

36:35.024 --> 36:38.294
I've fought this type of matches many times before

36:38.414 --> 36:42.212
They were blades below then, not stools

36:42.596 --> 36:45.784
Have you heard of this Yip Man before?

36:45.904 --> 36:49.513
The name means nothing to me. No

36:50.267 --> 36:53.863
I'm sure he's no match for you, Master Luo

36:53.886 --> 36:55.405
Likewise, Master Zhang

36:57.157 --> 36:58.440
Will you be going up there?

36:58.560 --> 37:00.075
I'll go if you go

37:00.558 --> 37:02.722
Enough talk. Let's drink tea

37:03.350 --> 37:04.245
Cheers

37:09.792 --> 37:11.133
Master

37:16.751 --> 37:18.245
He's here

37:24.432 --> 37:25.810
Fellow Masters

37:27.177 --> 37:28.800
This is Yip Man

37:29.659 --> 37:32.377
He wants to establish his sect here in Hong Kong

37:32.695 --> 37:36.636
That's why he's here today to accept your challenges

37:37.707 --> 37:38.483
Yip Man

37:39.729 --> 37:41.424
If you surrender, you lose

37:41.718 --> 37:43.447
If you leave the table, you lose

37:43.567 --> 37:47.156
If you're the last man standing on
the table after all the challenges

37:47.533 --> 37:49.815
I'll greet you as "Master Yip"

37:49.935 --> 37:52.829
If there are no questions, we can begin

38:06.537 --> 38:09.573
What, he's just going to walk up to the table?

38:10.655 --> 38:14.019
He's not supposed to touch the ground

38:27.189 --> 38:29.830
Greetings fellow masters. I am Yip Man

38:30.442 --> 38:33.406
I'm from Wing Chun sect from Fo Shan

38:33.794 --> 38:35.947
I hope my fellow masters will
go easy on me

38:36.067 --> 38:38.172
Which master will have a go?

38:39.031 --> 38:41.689
Master Luo, aren't you going?

38:42.795 --> 38:45.785
I'll wait and see if anyone else is going first

38:53.946 --> 38:57.922
Fine then, I'll be the first

39:17.522 --> 39:18.205
Please

39:19.334 --> 39:19.805
Please

39:23.021 --> 39:24.757
Lightning Kick

39:24.758 --> 39:25.781
Beware, brother

40:15.263 --> 40:17.357
Are you all right Master Luo?

40:17.922 --> 40:18.510
I'm fine!

40:19.590 --> 40:22.848
He'd be dead if it were blades below

40:23.273 --> 40:24.884
This is too much

40:25.872 --> 40:27.954
The table is really slippery!

40:29.554 --> 40:30.872
Thank you for going easy

40:30.992 --> 40:33.112
Come on, don't let him stop

40:33.124 --> 40:36.429
Master Zhang, your turn

40:38.666 --> 40:41.842
Master Zhang, go on... go on

40:49.811 --> 40:53.906
Master Zhang, the table is really very slippery

41:02.045 --> 41:02.693
Please

41:04.469 --> 41:05.304
Please

42:17.686 --> 42:19.003
I yield!

42:28.906 --> 42:30.211
Thank you for showing mercy

42:30.623 --> 42:31.871
Thank you for going easy on me

42:33.337 --> 42:35.690
Any other masters want to have a go?

43:24.178 --> 43:24.729
Please

43:26.384 --> 43:26.861
Please

45:23.699 --> 45:25.360
Master Yip

45:25.854 --> 45:26.886
Master Hong

45:29.175 --> 45:34.336
To join this association, you must pay a monthly fee

45:34.456 --> 45:35.816
What fees?

45:35.936 --> 45:40.350
It's the rules. Everyone pays $100 a month

45:40.470 --> 45:42.503
Pay and you'll have no trouble

45:47.888 --> 45:54.171
If there's any masters that still think
I'm not worthy, I'm game anytime

45:54.753 --> 46:00.362
But I won't fulfil your personal financial 
interests by paying this "fee"

46:01.798 --> 46:06.285
As you wish. Don't look for me
if you're in trouble next time

46:07.318 --> 46:09.606
You may go now

46:23.160 --> 46:24.058
Medication

46:31.193 --> 46:34.110
Master, here's the medication

46:45.110 --> 46:48.125
Are you insane? Drawing these on my newspaper?

46:48.245 --> 46:51.124
I just wanted readers to understand the content

46:51.245 --> 46:52.610
Is the feedback that bad?

46:54.595 --> 46:58.036
Everyone in Hong Kong now wants to learn Wing Chun!

46:58.156 --> 46:58.910
This is fantastic!

46:59.030 --> 47:02.660
Continue the drawings. I'm counting on you

47:03.616 --> 47:04.086
Get back to work!

47:04.718 --> 47:07.218
Well done! Good job!

47:10.548 --> 47:14.959
(Wing Chun fights Hong Style to a stalemate)

47:19.099 --> 47:21.864
Mei, stop doing your homework. Eat

47:22.349 --> 47:23.128
Eat first, ok?

47:23.457 --> 47:25.208
Wife, more porridge please

47:27.222 --> 47:31.163
You've not been eating well lately. Eat more

47:33.895 --> 47:34.869
Where are you going?

47:34.989 --> 47:38.435
You blind? I'm going up to do my laundry

47:39.081 --> 47:40.625
Are you really just doing your laundry?

47:40.626 --> 47:44.550
What do you think this big basin
is for? Washing my head?

47:44.551 --> 47:46.697
151.... 152...

47:46.698 --> 47:47.801
Where are you headed?

47:47.818 --> 47:48.972
To learn Wing Chun

47:49.219 --> 47:51.477
Wing Chun? It's not here

47:51.907 --> 47:52.907
The newspapers say it's here

47:52.930 --> 47:54.401
No it's not. Go away!

47:54.425 --> 47:55.531
You're better off learning Hong style

47:56.189 --> 47:56.836
Hey!

47:58.259 --> 48:00.448
You bunch of rascals are preventing
people from learning Wing Chun!

48:00.471 --> 48:01.615
You son of a bitch!

48:01.638 --> 48:02.556
Come down!

48:02.676 --> 48:04.615
What are you doing?

48:04.735 --> 48:06.006
You deaf?

48:06.126 --> 48:07.335
Come down!

48:08.476 --> 48:10.041
What? No, you come up

48:10.064 --> 48:11.370
Come down if you have the guts

48:20.016 --> 48:21.413
Come down if you dare!

48:21.436 --> 48:23.166
You're crazy! So unbecoming!

48:24.305 --> 48:25.695
Look, Wing Chun disciples!

48:26.070 --> 48:26.975
Attack!

48:31.327 --> 48:31.998
They're coming down

48:32.010 --> 48:32.433
Hurry

48:36.701 --> 48:38.419
Come out!

49:22.713 --> 49:25.395
The owners are thinking twice after what happened today

49:25.688 --> 49:26.218
I understand

49:26.338 --> 49:28.912
They've decided not to lend this rooftop to you anymore

49:29.032 --> 49:30.571
I understand. I'm sorry

49:31.018 --> 49:33.088
I'm sorry too. I'll be going now

49:37.621 --> 49:38.445
Goodbye

49:38.891 --> 49:39.950
Bye, Brother Geng

50:08.841 --> 50:15.132
Master...

50:19.899 --> 50:21.594
I'm sure you know by now

50:25.052 --> 50:27.076
We can't train here anymore

50:27.726 --> 50:30.738
Master, it's not our fault! They started it!

50:30.973 --> 50:33.032
Yes they started it

50:33.385 --> 50:34.625
Let's go look for them to settle this

50:38.978 --> 50:40.307
Pack this place up before you go

50:41.172 --> 50:42.571
Bring the wooden men to my house

50:42.971 --> 50:45.818
Master...

51:02.038 --> 51:02.816
Ji

51:04.919 --> 51:08.390
Give these to the disciples. They've earned it

51:08.887 --> 51:09.579
Thank you Master

51:13.431 --> 51:15.137
- Here's yours.
- Thanks

51:15.257 --> 51:16.798
Good work everyone

51:18.593 --> 51:20.901
You still dare to show up here?

51:27.484 --> 51:28.954
I'm here to see your Master

51:29.436 --> 51:33.024
Ji... you may all retire

51:43.978 --> 51:47.366
So, your school in a bit of a jam?

51:48.589 --> 51:53.966
I'm here to tell you that I'll continue
teaching martial arts even without a school

51:54.086 --> 51:56.232
And I'll never pay you a single cent!

51:56.586 --> 51:58.021
Don't ever harass my disciples again

51:58.035 --> 51:59.765
And don't get other people involved

51:59.885 --> 52:03.470
You are causing trouble by not following the rules

52:04.141 --> 52:05.893
If it weren't for me placating the Westerners

52:06.013 --> 52:09.633
Do you think everyone else can teach martial arts in peace?

52:09.753 --> 52:12.188
You chose to collude with the Westerners

52:12.308 --> 52:15.845
Yip Man, you only think about yourself

52:16.195 --> 52:20.183
You don't have 200 disciples, of course you
don't need the blessings of the Westerners

52:20.303 --> 52:22.076
Of course you can take it easy

52:25.973 --> 52:29.138
I understand what you're saying

52:29.258 --> 52:34.356
As Masters, aren't we are obligated to guide our own disciples first?

52:35.580 --> 52:37.591
My conscience is clear

52:38.168 --> 52:43.779
As you wish. If you're upset with
me in the future, come directly to me
Goodbye!

52:43.802 --> 52:44.920
Hold it!

52:45.520 --> 52:47.449
You're not leaving that easily

52:47.685 --> 52:48.708
What do you want then?

52:49.155 --> 52:51.684
We did not finish our match earlier.
It's time to finish it

53:02.767 --> 53:04.320
Watch out!

53:09.253 --> 53:12.076
Husband, we've been waiting
for you to start dinner

53:12.196 --> 53:16.088
The children are hungry. Are you finished
discussing business?

53:30.063 --> 53:37.521
Master Hong, do you think it's more important to
have dinner with your family, or to finish the match?

53:41.832 --> 53:43.397
What does everyone want to eat?

53:43.517 --> 53:45.503
Ice cream!!

53:45.750 --> 53:47.844
I'll bring you all out for ice cream after dinner

53:53.500 --> 53:56.594
I'll take my leave, Master Hong

53:58.582 --> 54:01.029
Please see yourself out

54:20.164 --> 54:21.023
Master

54:21.282 --> 54:24.015
Come in

54:25.391 --> 54:26.862
Put it over there

54:27.650 --> 54:28.921
Here, over here

54:28.933 --> 54:31.252
Why are the wooden men brought back home?

54:32.168 --> 54:35.063
The rooftop is being rented
to someone else

54:35.616 --> 54:38.133
So I've brought them home

54:44.751 --> 54:49.951
Ok, you go on home. We'll start
training here tomorrow morning

54:50.233 --> 54:52.045
- Train here?
- Yes

54:52.374 --> 54:54.538
Be here early tomorrow morning

54:54.658 --> 54:55.515
Bye Master

54:55.538 --> 54:56.303
Go home and relax

54:56.315 --> 54:58.056
Goodbye Master

55:06.148 --> 55:10.006
Master, I wish to talk to you

55:18.019 --> 55:21.630
Have some tea, Liang

55:26.045 --> 55:27.292
Have a seat

55:33.907 --> 55:39.284
Master, it's my fault that
you lost the school. I'm sorry

55:39.577 --> 55:42.848
Please, get up

55:43.486 --> 55:44.921
Get up

55:45.580 --> 55:48.450
Come, sit down and we'll talk

55:57.040 --> 56:01.011
Liang, do you think I'm very skilful?

56:01.894 --> 56:05.092
Of course! You can fight off 10 men!

56:05.188 --> 56:07.683
What about 20 years later?

56:08.474 --> 56:11.838
In 20 year's time, you can beat me easily

56:13.212 --> 56:15.363
People will grow old

56:15.915 --> 56:19.407
No one's invincible forever in this world

56:20.308 --> 56:25.050
Actually, you have a knack for martial arts

56:25.170 --> 56:29.558
However, you're only focusing on the fighting techniques

56:30.168 --> 56:33.364
I want to you to understand the spirit in Chinese martial arts

56:33.484 --> 56:44.708
It enbodies the Chinese heart, mind and soul

56:51.171 --> 56:52.894
Understand?

56:56.233 --> 56:58.567
I'm trying to

57:03.238 --> 57:06.648
Want to hear a story?

57:08.157 --> 57:16.557
Years ago, I smacked the butt of that Master Jin we met in jail

57:17.562 --> 57:26.682
Back at Fo Shan, he came to my house
to fight me and messed my place up, so.....

57:41.811 --> 57:44.252
Are you practicing kung fu?

57:45.329 --> 57:48.739
Yes, I'll teach you when you grow up

57:49.341 --> 57:50.599
Come on let's go

58:03.379 --> 58:04.708
Master, look

58:09.375 --> 58:11.780
Continue your practice

58:20.040 --> 58:22.085
Fancy meeting you here

58:22.803 --> 58:25.065
I was in the neighbourhood

58:26.250 --> 58:28.332
What do you want?

58:30.092 --> 58:34.436
I have extra tickets, and wondered
if you'd like to come too

58:34.556 --> 58:38.097
It's a Western boxing match

58:41.904 --> 58:43.841
Goodbye

58:44.667 --> 58:50.053
Master Hong, your eyes are red
Are you all right?

58:51.221 --> 58:54.814
Oh I've had it since morning. I'm
probably coming down with something

58:54.935 --> 58:56.821
I'll be fine after some herbal tea

58:57.253 --> 59:01.094
This is a nice place for training

59:09.926 --> 59:11.649
Place 3 rows here

59:11.769 --> 59:13.409
3 rows over there too

59:13.529 --> 59:14.773
Hurry up

59:23.712 --> 59:24.789
Master Hong

59:24.909 --> 59:27.668
Come over and say hi. I'll
introduce you to the Champion

59:32.885 --> 59:34.310
Hello

59:37.110 --> 59:40.161
Ignore him. Westerners like to leave things around

59:41.885 --> 59:45.726
So when will we get our money?

59:46.731 --> 59:50.142
He keeps avoiding the subject

59:51.147 --> 59:53.050
Do it for free this time

59:53.170 --> 59:57.418
Free? My men stopped working at
the fish stall to set this place up!

59:57.538 --> 01:00:03.668
Don't be upset, or else there'll be 
trouble. Take it as going on a diet

01:00:05.319 --> 01:00:06.756
This isn't the first time

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:08.155
Master Hong!

01:00:11.027 --> 01:00:12.320
Chief

01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:16.341
It's ok not to pay me. However my men
need to eat. You have to pay them

01:00:16.461 --> 01:00:19.500
Don't speak to me about money now

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.726
If not money, then love?

01:00:34.244 --> 01:00:36.206
Now you've made him angry

01:00:36.326 --> 01:00:37.929
If he's not paying, I'm quitting

01:00:45.576 --> 01:00:48.161
If you quit, he'll take your 
fish stall too. Just bear with it

01:00:48.282 --> 01:00:50.674
Bear with it? I've tolerated it for a long time!

01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:58.278
Speak Chinese, not English!

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:07.120
You heard him. Let's go

01:01:08.112 --> 01:01:09.491
We quit too! Let's go

01:01:09.611 --> 01:01:10.796
Let's go

01:01:10.916 --> 01:01:12.193
Hold on!

01:01:12.723 --> 01:01:15.899
Look, they'll get in trouble because of you

01:01:18.737 --> 01:01:20.595
You guys stay and work

01:01:23.467 --> 01:01:26.973
Let's get back to work

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.030
Come on

01:01:32.173 --> 01:01:36.690
Don't be angry. He will get his retribution

01:02:03.431 --> 01:02:04.675
- Master Yip
- Master Hong

01:02:05.068 --> 01:02:06.040
Thank you for the tickets

01:02:06.303 --> 01:02:09.295
There will be a demonstration of kung fu
from every school on stage later

01:02:09.415 --> 01:02:11.366
Please ask your disciples to show yours off

01:02:11.752 --> 01:02:14.686
Let more people learn about your Wing Chun

01:02:15.475 --> 01:02:16.327
Yes of course

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:17.939
See you later

01:02:33.845 --> 01:02:35.657
Hey you, get ready

01:02:36.692 --> 01:02:38.080
- You 2 go up too
- Ok

01:02:40.174 --> 01:02:41.692
Go up and join them

01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:43.672
Let's go

01:02:45.331 --> 01:02:46.684
This isn't good

01:02:47.085 --> 01:02:51.470
It's not your money that is used to
promote Chinese martial arts

01:05:56.569 --> 01:05:58.005
Stop fighting!

01:05:59.322 --> 01:06:00.287
Stop fighting!

01:06:00.977 --> 01:06:03.082
Break it up! Stop fighting!

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:06.200
What do we do?

01:06:13.323 --> 01:06:15.746
Everyone, stop fighting!

01:06:19.181 --> 01:06:19.876
Stop fighting!

01:06:21.624 --> 01:06:23.377
Break it up!

01:06:24.377 --> 01:06:25.460
Stop!

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:26.307
Stop fighting!

01:06:28.648 --> 01:06:29.307
Stop it!

01:06:30.118 --> 01:06:31.259
Calm down!

01:06:33.889 --> 01:06:34.371
Stop fighting!

01:06:35.324 --> 01:06:35.994
Calm down!

01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:37.324
Everyone please calm down

01:06:39.747 --> 01:06:40.864
Liang!

01:06:42.634 --> 01:06:43.552
Bring him down

01:06:44.151 --> 01:06:45.139
Xin, help please

01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:48.786
Slowly! Slowly!

01:06:59.438 --> 01:07:00.720
Come here, MC

01:07:04.485 --> 01:07:07.814
If you don't like our demonstration,
you are free to leave

01:07:08.437 --> 01:07:10.990
But you've caused injuries, 
you need to apologise

01:07:44.671 --> 01:07:45.812
I will fight!

01:07:46.446 --> 01:07:47.481
I will flatten him to the ground!

01:07:47.482 --> 01:07:48.611
Until he apologises!

01:07:48.634 --> 01:07:49.470
Kill the Westerner!

01:07:49.988 --> 01:07:53.235
Fellow masters, leave this to me

01:07:54.609 --> 01:07:56.680
Everyone please stand down

01:07:57.138 --> 01:07:59.620
Fine, we'll stand down

01:09:27.841 --> 01:09:28.828
Thank you

01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:38.805
Master Hong, are you good?

01:09:40.354 --> 01:09:41.625
I'm good, no problem

01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:48.212
In the next round, don't go head on
with him. Attack his biceps

01:09:51.955 --> 01:09:53.895
It won't be that easy

01:11:48.669 --> 01:11:52.911
Oh no! Master's having an asthma attack

01:12:34.256 --> 01:12:36.268
Please stop the fight, Master Hong

01:12:38.609 --> 01:12:41.256
I won't let these Westerners belittle us

01:12:41.269 --> 01:12:42.881
Don't get maimed just for pride

01:12:43.822 --> 01:12:45.446
I can tolerate if it's only my life

01:12:46.296 --> 01:12:48.261
But not if it's the entire Chinese martial arts world

01:13:36.955 --> 01:13:38.472
Master...

01:14:35.794 --> 01:14:39.069
Master, yield!

01:14:41.912 --> 01:14:42.716
Master!

01:17:00.734 --> 01:17:09.990
Master Hong, I have the utmost respect for you

01:17:33.164 --> 01:17:39.123
(Master Hong of Hong style school killed in a Western boxing match)

01:18:12.136 --> 01:18:13.651
- What's happening?
- Sit down!

01:18:15.558 --> 01:18:19.316
None of your business. Sit down

01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:26.665
Who's the editor?

01:18:29.021 --> 01:18:30.235
What's up?

01:18:30.355 --> 01:18:31.618
Arrest him

01:18:31.619 --> 01:18:33.193
Sir!

01:18:52.075 --> 01:18:52.884
Please don't!

01:18:53.413 --> 01:18:54.310
No, please!

01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:56.207
No!

01:19:01.133 --> 01:19:04.007
Sir!

01:19:06.488 --> 01:19:11.129
It won't look good for you. He'll continue
to give you bad press if you continue the beatings

01:19:11.249 --> 01:19:14.411
I will deal with him. Leave it to me

01:19:15.347 --> 01:19:19.043
Fat Aunt, you must set him straight

01:22:02.236 --> 01:22:05.143
How can he say such things?

01:22:05.263 --> 01:22:07.693
The Chinese don't use joss sticks just to mark time

01:22:13.259 --> 01:22:15.097
The Chinese practice of burning joss sticks

01:22:15.217 --> 01:22:20.427
Other than measuring time, and more
importantly, it is to honour our ancestors

01:22:21.016 --> 01:22:23.038
It's the Chinese culture

01:22:25.776 --> 01:22:28.810
Mr Milos

01:22:29.103 --> 01:22:30.353
I challenge you

01:23:06.990 --> 01:23:10.400
Chun, eat quickly. Don't let Mrs Fang wait

01:23:12.285 --> 01:23:15.472
I'll see you off later

01:23:37.717 --> 01:23:41.127
Mama, why must we stay over at Mrs Fang's?

01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:46.109
Because Daddy wants to train

01:23:48.398 --> 01:23:50.821
Here, let me

01:23:50.941 --> 01:23:53.469
- Sorry for the trouble
- It's no trouble

01:23:53.589 --> 01:23:55.713
The boy is Yip Chun

01:23:56.207 --> 01:23:58.764
Mr Yip, you must beat that Westerner!

01:24:00.066 --> 01:24:02.445
I'll bring these in first

01:24:18.314 --> 01:24:21.373
Don't worry about us. Concentrate on your training

01:24:22.373 --> 01:24:23.702
But don't stay up too late

01:24:24.408 --> 01:24:26.326
You must win

01:24:32.234 --> 01:24:33.598
Let's go

01:24:34.764 --> 01:24:35.716
You go on home

01:24:49.907 --> 01:24:53.366
Normally I live alone. Just make yourselves at home

01:24:54.848 --> 01:24:55.907
This is your bed

01:25:12.728 --> 01:25:13.877
It's ok. Continue

01:25:15.234 --> 01:25:17.849
I said, continue!

01:25:24.122 --> 01:25:25.087
What's wrong?

01:25:25.707 --> 01:25:27.545
Police!

01:25:29.499 --> 01:25:30.556
What are you writing?

01:25:31.544 --> 01:25:32.439
Still dare to write?

01:25:33.266 --> 01:25:34.944
Not afraid of another beating?

01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:42.196
"Wing Chun Master accepts challenge to a Western boxing match"

01:25:42.317 --> 01:25:44.218
Do you think that's good enough?

01:25:44.338 --> 01:25:47.503
Why not "Western Dog Soundly Defeated"?

01:25:53.131 --> 01:25:56.590
"Reporter endures Police brutality for the truth"

01:25:56.606 --> 01:25:58.651
But did you get the truth?

01:25:58.658 --> 01:25:59.563
I have the truth!

01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:05.400
You have guts. I'll give you the truth
and you write about him till he is ruined

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:06.743
Ok, ok!

01:26:07.756 --> 01:26:11.390
That Chief hates us Chinese. Always bullies us

01:26:11.510 --> 01:26:15.212
I'll break the real news to you, 
you report it. It will finish him off!

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:43.204
Mrs Yip, what's wrong?

01:26:43.324 --> 01:26:45.797
Oh you're in labour! Chun, go fetch your father!

01:26:45.917 --> 01:26:48.056
No, I don't want to distract him

01:26:48.444 --> 01:26:49.950
Then I'll go get a midwife

01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:51.697
Chun, take care of your mom

01:27:12.504 --> 01:27:14.351
Master Zhang, over there!

01:27:20.204 --> 01:27:23.308
The Hong Kong Chinese-Western Boxing Match will start soon

01:27:23.538 --> 01:27:26.067
The hall is packed with both Chinese and Westerners

01:27:26.187 --> 01:27:27.761
It's very lively here

01:27:27.979 --> 01:27:31.108
There are Chinese judges in the judging panel this time

01:27:31.325 --> 01:27:34.465
Hopefully it will be a truly fair and impartial match

01:27:34.586 --> 01:27:36.559
Don't go away folks!

01:27:36.679 --> 01:27:38.700
I tell you, he'll go down in 3 strikes

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:41.753
No, I mean he'll defeat the Westener in 3 strikes

01:27:41.873 --> 01:27:45.284
Master Yip, are you confident of beating him?

01:27:45.404 --> 01:27:49.179
You must win!

01:27:49.299 --> 01:27:52.378
Are you fighting for yourself, or for Chinese martial arts?

01:28:21.743 --> 01:28:24.214
The Twister is making an entrance

01:29:27.525 --> 01:29:31.107
Good! Yip Man can't wait to kick his ass

01:29:35.056 --> 01:29:36.091
Master...

01:30:34.395 --> 01:30:37.913
Master Yip, kick his ass like how you kicked mine!

01:30:38.033 --> 01:30:39.289
Anyone can kick your ass

01:30:39.409 --> 01:30:40.233
Shut up!

01:30:44.157 --> 01:30:46.511
Both of them are sizing each other up

01:31:38.535 --> 01:31:40.429
Master Yip!

01:31:43.088 --> 01:31:43.746
Master!

01:31:44.052 --> 01:31:47.437
Master Yip has been knocked down! They're going to start the knockout count

01:31:48.708 --> 01:31:51.225
Master Yip! Get up!

01:31:51.345 --> 01:31:54.201
He appears to be injured. I'm not 
sure if he can even stand up

01:32:05.426 --> 01:32:07.602
Master Yip seems ok, and he's up

01:32:41.798 --> 01:32:44.798
This time it's The Twister that's knocked down

01:33:47.231 --> 01:33:47.890
Good work, Master!

01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:52.831
That bloody Westerner... still standing even after so many hits

01:34:15.090 --> 01:34:17.513
Master Yip is attacking with his Wing Chun

01:34:25.397 --> 01:34:42.546
(chanting) Master Yip! Master Yip! Master Yip!

01:34:54.070 --> 01:34:56.574
Hey that's cheating!

01:34:58.688 --> 01:35:01.353
You animal! The bell has gone!

01:35:07.006 --> 01:35:09.303
Master, Master!

01:36:52.591 --> 01:36:54.038
Master!

01:36:54.497 --> 01:36:55.600
Master!

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:58.977
Oh my God! Master Yip is down after
a knockout blow from The Twister!

01:37:00.793 --> 01:37:02.700
Master, get up!

01:37:03.136 --> 01:37:05.480
Get up! Get up!

01:37:05.940 --> 01:37:08.720
Get up, Master!

01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.801
"We cannot allow the Westerners to belittle us"

01:37:12.514 --> 01:37:14.628
"I can bear it if it's just my life"

01:37:15.064 --> 01:37:17.407
"But I cannot tolerate it if it's the entire Chinese martial arts world"

01:37:44.985 --> 01:37:48.385
"Master Hong, don't go head on with him. Attack his biceps"

01:37:48.505 --> 01:37:49.695
"It won't be that easy"

01:39:08.190 --> 01:39:09.648
4

01:39:09.768 --> 01:39:11.131
5

01:39:11.251 --> 01:39:12.342
6

01:39:12.462 --> 01:39:13.495
7

01:39:13.615 --> 01:39:14.601
8

01:39:14.721 --> 01:39:15.824
9

01:39:15.944 --> 01:39:17.001
10!

01:39:25.948 --> 01:39:28.471
Daddy's won! Daddy's won! Yay!

01:40:04.123 --> 01:40:05.406
I know Yip Man!

01:40:05.527 --> 01:40:06.935
Dude, everyone here knows Yip Man

01:40:07.055 --> 01:40:11.353
Huo Yan Jia, Huang Fei Hong, Yip Man
and me. The 4 Dragons of Fo Shan!

01:42:26.634 --> 01:42:28.496
Master Yip!

01:42:29.323 --> 01:42:31.736
What do you want to do now?

01:42:33.987 --> 01:42:36.101
I want to go home

01:43:20.281 --> 01:43:21.775
He looks like you

01:43:24.257 --> 01:43:25.704
What shall we call him?

01:43:26.485 --> 01:43:27.405
How about Yip Ching?

01:43:28.680 --> 01:43:30.480
I want him to be an upright person

01:43:30.738 --> 01:43:31.350
Ok

01:43:32.154 --> 01:43:32.990
He looks like you

01:44:02.681 --> 01:44:03.457
Uncle Man

01:44:03.782 --> 01:44:08.076
I have a new friend, and he
wants to learn kung fu from you

01:44:08.196 --> 01:44:09.299
Come in

01:44:14.489 --> 01:44:16.618
I want to learn from you. How much?

01:44:25.972 --> 01:44:26.842
What's your name?

01:44:26.962 --> 01:44:29.044
I'm Bruce Lee

01:44:30.548 --> 01:44:32.336
Why do you want to learn how to fight?

01:44:32.457 --> 01:44:34.972
So that I can beat up people I don't like

01:44:37.326 --> 01:44:38.667
Very spirited

01:44:41.409 --> 01:44:44.067
Come back when you've grown up

01:45:01.358 --> 01:45:06.946
(In 1956, 16 year-old Bruce Lee became Yip Man's disciple)

01:45:07.393 --> 01:45:13.998
(Bruce Lee studied Wing Chun extensively and helped promote it)

01:45:14.538 --> 01:45:20.531
(Yip Man spent the next 22 years teaching Wing Chun
and spreading it all over the world)

01:45:22.977 --> 01:45:26.964
(For the glory of Chinese martial arts)
