01:57.401 --> 01:58.734
Dismount!

02:05.283 --> 02:07.076
Herman's horse-sick!

02:14.292 --> 02:16.585
Chaps, no one wander off.

02:17.504 --> 02:20.548
Some of the passageways
in here can run for miles.

02:30.809 --> 02:33.519
I don't think this is such a good idea.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.400
What is it?

03:04.885 --> 03:06.886
- Alfred, did you get anything yet?
- Nothing.

03:06.970 --> 03:07.970
Then keep digging.

03:08.055 --> 03:10.014
The kid's got something!

03:11.725 --> 03:13.726
I got something, Garth!
I got something...

03:13.810 --> 03:15.561
I got something right here.

03:21.985 --> 03:23.611
Look at that!

03:24.738 --> 03:26.530
- We're rich! We're rich!
- Shut up. Shut up.

03:26.615 --> 03:28.699
Well, we're rich, ain't we?

03:30.827 --> 03:32.036
Indy...

03:33.038 --> 03:34.163
Indy?

03:34.998 --> 03:36.749
What are they doing?

03:37.000 --> 03:39.293
Indiana? Indiana?

03:44.049 --> 03:46.509
Hey, we got to find
more stuff to bring back.

03:46.843 --> 03:48.636
It's the Cross of Coronado.

03:49.429 --> 03:51.680
Cortez gave it to him in 1520.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.015
Oh, boy!

03:53.934 --> 03:58.020
I'm thinkin' about raisin' my dead mama,
dig down and put it on her bony finger!

03:58.605 --> 04:02.191
That cross is an important artifact.
It belongs in a museum.

04:03.151 --> 04:04.652
Run back and find the others.

04:04.778 --> 04:07.196
Tell Mr. Havelock
that there are men looting in the caves.

04:07.280 --> 04:10.449
Have him bring the sheriff.
It's only a snake.

04:10.534 --> 04:12.034
Did you hear what I said?

04:12.119 --> 04:13.619
Right. Run back...

04:13.703 --> 04:15.871
Mr. Havelock... The sheriff...

04:15.956 --> 04:17.957
What, what are you gonna do?

04:18.041 --> 04:19.500
I don't know.

04:19.584 --> 04:21.127
I'll think of something.

04:26.800 --> 04:29.093
Dig with your hands,
not with your mouth.

04:44.234 --> 04:45.609
He's got our thing!

04:45.694 --> 04:47.403
- Get him!
- Get off me!

04:52.868 --> 04:55.077
Mr. Havelock! Anybody!

04:55.787 --> 04:57.454
Everybody's lost but me.

04:57.539 --> 05:00.082
There he is! Let's go! Let's go!

05:16.933 --> 05:18.767
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Dang it!

05:23.690 --> 05:25.441
Hey! Come back here!

05:39.164 --> 05:40.789
Come on! Get him!

05:49.216 --> 05:50.758
Hey, come back here!

06:57.242 --> 06:58.701
Here, let me.

07:36.740 --> 07:38.324
Holy smokes!

08:02.098 --> 08:03.557
Come on, kid.

08:05.935 --> 08:08.020
There's no way out of this.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.116
Hey!

08:40.553 --> 08:42.221
Toss up the whip.

08:52.148 --> 08:54.817
You got heart, kid,
but that belongs to me.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.318
It belongs to Coronado.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.737
Coronado is dead,
and so are all of his grandchildren.

08:58.822 --> 09:01.240
This should be in a museum.

09:01.324 --> 09:02.991
Now give it back!

09:06.037 --> 09:07.996
A snake! Snake!

09:08.373 --> 09:10.332
Don't let him get away!

09:11.668 --> 09:12.668
Magic?

09:14.712 --> 09:15.796
Hold it.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.673
Make sure he doesn't double back.

09:34.023 --> 09:36.859
Okay, kid, out of the box, now.

09:38.194 --> 09:39.570
Son of a...

09:51.207 --> 09:52.374
Damn.

10:03.720 --> 10:08.140
Dad!

10:09.767 --> 10:10.934
Dad.

10:12.228 --> 10:13.520
- Dad...
- Out.

10:13.605 --> 10:16.064
- It's important.
- Then wait. Count to 20.

10:16.232 --> 10:18.650
- No, Dad. You listen to me.
- Junior!

10:18.735 --> 10:20.068
One, two, three, four...

10:20.653 --> 10:21.945
In Greek.

10:34.751 --> 10:39.171
"May he who illuminated this,
illuminate me."

10:45.261 --> 10:47.137
I brought the sheriff.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.349
Just the man I want to see.

10:50.433 --> 10:51.600
Now, there were five or six of them...

10:51.684 --> 10:53.185
- It's all right, son.
- They came after me...

10:53.269 --> 10:55.646
- You still got it?
- Well, yes, sir.

10:55.730 --> 10:56.939
It's right here.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.316
I'm glad to see that

11:00.443 --> 11:04.780
because the rightful owner of this cross
won't press charges if you give it back.

11:06.324 --> 11:09.034
He's got witnesses, five or six of them.

11:20.171 --> 11:21.296
Yeah!

11:32.642 --> 11:33.934
Good day.

11:38.648 --> 11:40.440
You lost today, kid,

11:41.651 --> 11:44.403
but it doesn't mean you have to like it.

12:10.972 --> 12:12.931
Small world, Dr. Jones.

12:13.141 --> 12:15.100
Too small for two of us.

12:23.943 --> 12:25.777
This is the second time
I've had to reclaim

12:25.862 --> 12:27.154
my property from you.

12:27.238 --> 12:29.364
That belongs in a museum.

12:30.325 --> 12:31.825
So do you.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.411
Throw him over the side.

13:22.627 --> 13:24.252
Grab him, he's getting away! Stop him!

14:19.016 --> 14:22.561
Archeology is the search for fact...

14:25.231 --> 14:26.773
...not truth.

14:26.858 --> 14:28.191
If it's truth you're interested in,

14:28.276 --> 14:31.319
Dr. Tyree's philosophy class
is right down the hall.

14:32.280 --> 14:35.657
So forget any ideas you've got about
lost cities, exotic travel,

14:35.742 --> 14:37.159
and digging up the world.

14:37.243 --> 14:39.077
We do not follow maps
to buried treasure,

14:39.162 --> 14:42.205
and "X" never, ever, marks the spot.

14:45.668 --> 14:49.337
Seventy percent of all archeology
is done in the library.

14:49.547 --> 14:51.214
Research. Reading.

14:53.509 --> 14:56.845
We cannot afford to take mythology
at face value.

14:58.848 --> 15:00.348
Next week, Egyptology,

15:00.433 --> 15:04.269
starting with the excavation of Naukratis
by Flinders Petrie in 1885.

15:04.353 --> 15:07.063
I will be in my office
if anybody's got any problems,

15:07.148 --> 15:09.357
for the next hour and a half.

15:14.864 --> 15:16.907
Marcus, I did it.

15:17.366 --> 15:18.867
You've got it!

15:28.961 --> 15:31.630
You know how long I've
been looking for that?

15:31.714 --> 15:33.215
All your life.

15:33.549 --> 15:34.591
All my life.

15:34.675 --> 15:37.385
Well done, Indy. Very well done, indeed.

15:38.179 --> 15:41.556
This will find a place of honor
in our Spanish collection.

15:41.641 --> 15:45.560
We can discuss my honorarium
over dinner and champagne tonight.

15:45.853 --> 15:47.687
- Your treat.
- Yes.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.232
My treat.

15:53.277 --> 15:55.403
- Dr. Jones!
- Dr. Jones!

16:02.453 --> 16:04.162
Dr. Jones, I am so glad you're back.

16:04.247 --> 16:06.081
Your mail is on your desk.
Here are your phone messages.

16:06.165 --> 16:07.165
Dr. Jones, you promised...

16:07.250 --> 16:08.333
This is your appointment schedule,

16:08.417 --> 16:10.752
and these term papers
still haven't been graded.

16:10.878 --> 16:13.171
Okay. Irene, put everybody's name
on a list,

16:13.256 --> 16:14.381
get the order they arrived...

16:14.465 --> 16:16.299
- Oh, come on, Dr. Jones.
- Dr. Jones.

16:16.384 --> 16:20.554
...and I'll see each and
every one of them in turn.

16:32.608 --> 16:34.192
"Venice, Italy."

16:34.777 --> 16:36.236
Dr. Jones!

17:03.514 --> 17:04.890
Dr. Jones?

17:10.855 --> 17:12.188
Dr. Jones.

17:28.247 --> 17:31.458
I trust your trip down
was comfortable, Dr. Jones.

17:32.376 --> 17:34.711
My men didn't alarm you, I hope.

17:35.338 --> 17:37.881
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.

17:37.965 --> 17:39.674
I know who you are, Mr. Donovan.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.259
Your contributions to the museum
over the years

17:41.344 --> 17:42.802
have been extremely generous.

17:42.887 --> 17:45.096
Some of the pieces in your collection
here are very impressive.

17:45.181 --> 17:49.184
Well, like yourself, Dr. Jones,
I have a passion for antiquities.

17:49.518 --> 17:51.353
Have a look over here.

17:52.730 --> 17:54.689
This might interest you.

17:58.027 --> 18:01.196
Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol.

18:01.989 --> 18:03.615
Early Latin text.

18:04.075 --> 18:05.951
Mid-12th century, I should think.

18:06.035 --> 18:07.869
That was our assessment, as well.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.037
Where did this come from?

18:09.121 --> 18:12.082
My engineers unearthed it
in the mountain region north of Ankara

18:12.166 --> 18:14.376
while excavating for copper.

18:14.460 --> 18:16.962
Can you translate the inscription?

18:20.007 --> 18:23.760
"...who drinks the water
I shall give him, says the Lord,

18:23.844 --> 18:26.805
"will have a spring inside him

18:26.889 --> 18:29.766
"welling up for eternal life.

18:31.686 --> 18:33.520
"Let them bring me
to your holy mountain

18:33.604 --> 18:35.730
"in the place where you dwell.

18:35.815 --> 18:38.733
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

18:39.694 --> 18:42.237
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon,

18:43.155 --> 18:45.782
"to the temple where the cup that...

18:49.036 --> 18:53.289
"Where the cup that holds the blood
of Jesus Christ resides forever."

18:55.084 --> 18:57.460
The Holy Grail, Dr. Jones.

18:58.796 --> 19:02.007
The chalice used by Christ
during the Last Supper.

19:02.925 --> 19:05.844
The cup that caught His blood
at the Crucifixion

19:05.928 --> 19:08.847
and was entrusted to
Joseph of Arimathea.

19:10.057 --> 19:11.683
The Arthur legend.

19:11.767 --> 19:14.185
I've heard this bedtime story before.

19:14.270 --> 19:16.062
Eternal life, Dr. Jones!

19:16.147 --> 19:18.898
The gift of youth
to whoever drinks from the Grail.

19:18.983 --> 19:21.359
Now, that's a bedtime story
I'd like to wake up to.

19:21.444 --> 19:22.694
An old man's dream.

19:22.778 --> 19:26.239
Every man's dream,
including your father's, I believe.

19:30.327 --> 19:32.370
Grail lore is his hobby.

19:32.455 --> 19:34.039
He's a teacher of medieval literature.

19:34.123 --> 19:35.957
The one the students hope
they don't get.

19:37.126 --> 19:39.419
Walter, you're neglecting your guests.

19:39.503 --> 19:41.629
Be along in a moment, dear.

19:47.094 --> 19:48.928
Hard to resist, isn't it?

19:49.013 --> 19:52.599
The Holy Grail's final resting place
described in detail.

19:52.850 --> 19:54.517
What good is it?

19:54.602 --> 19:58.396
This Grail tablet speaks of deserts
and mountains and canyons.

19:58.647 --> 19:59.898
It's pretty vague.

19:59.982 --> 20:01.608
Where do you want to start looking?

20:01.692 --> 20:04.027
Maybe if the tablet were intact,
you'd have something to go on,

20:04.111 --> 20:05.737
but the entire top portion is missing.

20:05.821 --> 20:09.157
Just the same, an attempt to recover
the Grail is currently underway.

20:11.952 --> 20:15.121
Let me tell you another
bedtime story, Dr. Jones.

20:15.498 --> 20:18.249
After the Grail was entrusted
to Joseph of Arimathea,

20:18.334 --> 20:21.211
it disappeared,
and was lost for a thousand years

20:21.295 --> 20:25.048
before it was found again
by three knights of the First Crusade.

20:25.132 --> 20:26.591
Three brothers, to be exact.

20:26.675 --> 20:28.676
I've heard this one, as well.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.804
Two of these brothers
walked out of the desert

20:30.888 --> 20:33.932
150 years after having found the Grail

20:34.016 --> 20:36.059
and began the long journey
back to France,

20:36.143 --> 20:38.186
but only one of them made it.

20:38.270 --> 20:41.648
And before dying of extreme old age,

20:41.732 --> 20:46.361
he supposedly imparted his tale to a...
to a Franciscan friar, I think.

20:46.904 --> 20:49.197
Not "supposedly," Dr. Jones.

20:49.907 --> 20:54.327
This is the manuscript in which
the friar chronicled the knight's story.

20:54.954 --> 20:57.372
It doesn't reveal the location of
the Grail, I'm afraid,

20:57.540 --> 20:59.249
but the knight promised
that two markers

20:59.333 --> 21:00.875
that had been left behind would.

21:01.252 --> 21:04.587
This tablet is one of those markers.

21:04.672 --> 21:06.881
It proves the knight's story is true.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.551
But as you pointed out, it's incomplete.

21:09.635 --> 21:12.595
Now, the second marker is entombed
with the knight's dead brother.

21:13.180 --> 21:15.765
Our project leader
believes that tomb to be located

21:15.850 --> 21:18.518
within the city of Venice, Italy.

21:20.896 --> 21:22.981
As you can now see, Dr. Jones,

21:23.524 --> 21:26.067
we're about to complete a great quest

21:26.152 --> 21:29.195
that began almost 2,000 years ago.

21:29.905 --> 21:31.656
We're only one step away.

21:31.740 --> 21:34.909
That's usually when the ground falls out
from underneath your feet.

21:35.744 --> 21:37.620
You could be more right than you know.

21:37.913 --> 21:38.997
Yes?

21:39.248 --> 21:40.915
We've hit a snag.

21:41.876 --> 21:45.962
Our project leader has vanished,
along with all his research.

21:46.881 --> 21:49.549
We received a cable from his colleague,
Dr. Schneider,

21:49.633 --> 21:53.344
who has no idea of his whereabouts
or what's become of him.

21:53.762 --> 21:57.098
I want you to pick up the trail
where he left off.

21:57.474 --> 22:00.268
Find the man,
and you will find the Grail.

22:01.812 --> 22:04.606
You've got the wrong Jones,
Mr. Donovan.

22:06.442 --> 22:08.401
Why don't you try my father?

22:08.485 --> 22:10.278
We already have.

22:10.362 --> 22:13.323
Your father is the man
who has disappeared.

22:24.960 --> 22:27.212
Your father and I have been friends
since time began.

22:27.296 --> 22:28.504
I've watched you grow up, Indy.

22:28.589 --> 22:30.298
I've watched the two of you grow apart.

22:30.382 --> 22:32.383
I've never seen you this concerned
about him before.

22:32.468 --> 22:33.593
Dad?

22:33.677 --> 22:35.803
He's an academic, a bookworm.
He's not a field man.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.640
Dad?

22:39.141 --> 22:40.391
Dear God.

22:43.229 --> 22:46.522
What has the old fool
got himself into now?

22:47.608 --> 22:50.610
I don't know, but whatever it is,
he's in over his head.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.362
Dad?

22:52.947 --> 22:55.698
It's today's mail, and it's been opened.

22:58.285 --> 22:59.369
Mail.

22:59.995 --> 23:01.663
That's it, Marcus.

23:04.124 --> 23:05.625
Venice, Italy.

23:08.963 --> 23:10.338
What is it?

23:13.592 --> 23:15.510
It's Dad's Grail diary.

23:17.429 --> 23:20.515
Every clue he followed.
Every discovery he made.

23:20.599 --> 23:23.101
A complete record of his search
for the Holy Grail.

23:24.853 --> 23:26.771
This is his whole life.

23:27.314 --> 23:29.857
Why would he have sent this to me?

23:29.942 --> 23:31.359
I don't know,

23:31.443 --> 23:34.070
but someone must want it pretty badly.

23:44.206 --> 23:46.124
Do you believe, Marcus?

23:58.220 --> 24:01.014
Do you believe the Grail actually exists?

24:02.391 --> 24:06.978
The search for the Cup of Christ
is the search for the divine in all of us.

24:07.354 --> 24:10.064
But if you want facts, Indy,
I've none to give you.

24:11.233 --> 24:14.652
At my age, I'm prepared to
take a few things on faith.

24:20.576 --> 24:21.743
Call Donovan, Marcus.

24:21.827 --> 24:24.746
Tell him I'll take that ticket
to Venice now.

24:26.415 --> 24:28.416
I'll tell him we'll take two.

24:33.505 --> 24:36.174
All right, tell me what's going to happen
when we get to Venice.

24:36.258 --> 24:38.217
Don't worry, Dr. Schneider
will be there to meet you.

24:38.302 --> 24:39.719
- Schneider?
- I maintain an apartment in Venice.

24:39.803 --> 24:40.845
It's at your disposal.

24:40.929 --> 24:42.847
Oh, well, that's good. Thank you.

24:44.975 --> 24:47.268
Dr. Jones, good luck.

24:48.103 --> 24:51.105
Now be very careful.
Don't trust anybody.

25:25.265 --> 25:27.225
Signora? Signorina?

25:34.817 --> 25:37.652
- Ah, Venice...
- Yes.

25:38.278 --> 25:41.823
How will we recognize
this Dr. Schneider when we see him?

25:42.324 --> 25:44.951
I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.

25:45.035 --> 25:46.369
Dr. Jones?

25:48.038 --> 25:49.163
Yes?

25:49.832 --> 25:51.499
I knew it was you.

25:52.167 --> 25:54.335
You have your father's eyes.

25:56.380 --> 25:59.632
And my mother's ears,
but the rest belongs to you.

26:00.342 --> 26:02.885
Looks like the best parts
have already been spoken for.

26:03.762 --> 26:05.888
- Marcus Brody?
- That's right.

26:06.515 --> 26:07.723
Dr. Elsa Schneider.

26:07.808 --> 26:08.975
How do you do?

26:09.893 --> 26:12.854
The last time I saw your father,
we were in the library.

26:12.938 --> 26:15.440
He was very close to tracking down
the knight's tomb.

26:15.524 --> 26:17.400
I've never seen him so excited.

26:17.484 --> 26:19.819
He was as giddy as a schoolboy.

26:19.903 --> 26:21.904
Who? Attila the Professor?

26:21.989 --> 26:25.158
He was never giddy,
even when he was a schoolboy.

26:25.909 --> 26:27.869
Fräulein, will you permit me?

26:28.078 --> 26:29.954
- I usually don't.
- I usually don't, either.

26:30.038 --> 26:32.457
- In that case, I permit you.
- It would make me very happy.

26:32.541 --> 26:34.876
But I'm already sad.
By tomorrow, it will have faded.

26:34.960 --> 26:35.960
Tomorrow I'll steal you another.

26:36.044 --> 26:38.379
I hate to interrupt you,
but the reason we're here...

26:38.464 --> 26:40.423
Yes. I have something to show you.

26:40.507 --> 26:42.300
I left your father working in the library.

26:42.384 --> 26:45.470
He sent me to the map section
to fetch an ancient plan of the city.

26:45.554 --> 26:48.389
When I got back to his table,
he'd gone, with all his papers,

26:48.474 --> 26:50.975
except for that scrap,
which I found near his chair.

26:51.059 --> 26:52.059
Roman numerals.

26:52.686 --> 26:54.437
Here is the library.

26:54.813 --> 26:57.440
That doesn't look much like a library.

26:57.691 --> 26:59.650
Looks like a converted church.

26:59.735 --> 27:01.819
In this case, it's the literal truth.

27:01.904 --> 27:03.654
We are on holy ground.

27:03.739 --> 27:07.366
These columns over here
were brought back as spoils of war

27:07.451 --> 27:10.745
after the sacking of Byzantium
during the Crusades.

27:12.164 --> 27:13.706
Now, please excuse me.

27:13.790 --> 27:15.500
The library's closing in a few moments.

27:15.584 --> 27:18.544
I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.

27:21.173 --> 27:24.759
Marcus, I've seen this window before.

27:24.843 --> 27:25.843
Where?

27:25.928 --> 27:28.095
Right here, in Dad's diary.

27:36.647 --> 27:37.855
You see?

27:37.940 --> 27:40.733
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.486
Dad was onto something here.

27:43.779 --> 27:45.404
Well, now we know
the source of the numbers,

27:45.489 --> 27:47.448
but we still don't know what they mean.

27:47.533 --> 27:49.033
Dad sent me this diary for a reason.

27:49.117 --> 27:51.827
Until we find out why,
I suggest we keep it to ourselves.

27:51.912 --> 27:53.120
Find something?

27:53.205 --> 27:55.206
Yes. Three, seven and ten.

27:55.290 --> 27:57.792
That window seems to be
the source of the Roman numerals.

27:57.876 --> 27:59.460
My God, I must be blind.

27:59.545 --> 28:02.713
Dad wasn't looking for a book
about the knight's tomb,

28:02.798 --> 28:04.757
he was looking for the tomb itself.

28:04.841 --> 28:06.175
Don't you get it?

28:06.260 --> 28:08.219
The tomb is somewhere in the library.

28:08.303 --> 28:10.221
You said yourself it used to be a church.

28:10.305 --> 28:11.430
Look.

28:11.723 --> 28:16.394
Three.

28:16.728 --> 28:17.937
Seven.

28:18.021 --> 28:19.564
Seven. Ten.

28:21.275 --> 28:22.483
And ten.

28:22.609 --> 28:24.360
Now where's the ten?

28:26.029 --> 28:27.989
Look around for the ten.

28:37.165 --> 28:38.791
Three and seven.

28:39.042 --> 28:40.960
Seven and seven

28:41.837 --> 28:43.004
and ten.

29:03.692 --> 29:04.692
Ten.

29:06.945 --> 29:08.529
"X" marks the spot.

30:06.088 --> 30:07.254
Bingo.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.923
You don't disappoint, Dr. Jones.

30:09.007 --> 30:10.549
You're a great deal like your father.

30:10.634 --> 30:12.176
Except he's lost, and I'm not.

30:12.260 --> 30:13.761
Lower me down.

30:23.814 --> 30:26.232
Look after this for me, will you?

30:40.080 --> 30:41.288
Come on.

30:49.005 --> 30:51.799
Pagan symbols. Fourth or fifth century.

30:51.967 --> 30:52.967
Right.

30:53.135 --> 30:55.511
600 years before the Crusades.

30:56.138 --> 30:58.097
The Christians would have
dug their own passages

30:58.181 --> 31:00.391
and burial chambers centuries later.

31:00.475 --> 31:01.475
That's right.

31:01.518 --> 31:04.061
If there's a knight of
the First Crusade down here,

31:04.146 --> 31:05.646
that's where we'll find him.

31:37.888 --> 31:39.597
What's this one?

31:39.681 --> 31:41.140
The Ark of the Covenant.

31:41.224 --> 31:43.309
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

32:01.036 --> 32:02.369
Watch out.

32:17.761 --> 32:18.969
It's petroleum.

32:19.054 --> 32:21.889
I should sink a well down here
and retire.

32:39.074 --> 32:40.241
Give me the lighter.

32:50.794 --> 32:52.086
Oh, rats.

33:08.562 --> 33:09.770
Come on.

33:58.653 --> 34:00.070
Come here.

34:08.163 --> 34:11.123
Look, it... it must be one of these.

34:11.498 --> 34:15.335
Look at the artistry of these carvings,
and the scrollwork.

34:31.728 --> 34:33.312
It's this one.

34:48.661 --> 34:51.455
This is it. We found it.

34:55.085 --> 34:56.210
Look.

34:57.045 --> 35:01.215
The engraving on the shield,
it's the same as on the Grail tablet.

35:03.218 --> 35:05.552
The shield is the second marker.

35:05.887 --> 35:07.346
What's that?

35:07.472 --> 35:10.474
It's a rubbing Dad made
of the Grail tablet.

35:12.394 --> 35:15.479
Just like your father,
giddy as a schoolboy.

35:16.898 --> 35:19.149
Wouldn't it be wonderful
if he were here now to see this?

35:21.236 --> 35:23.404
He never would have
made it past the rats.

35:23.488 --> 35:24.738
He hates rats.

35:24.823 --> 35:26.573
He's scared to death of them.

35:48.179 --> 35:50.514
Get back! Back against the wall.

35:55.311 --> 35:57.354
Quick! Under it! Air pocket!

36:03.528 --> 36:05.487
- Don't wander off.
- What?

36:05.780 --> 36:06.989
What?

36:26.009 --> 36:28.052
I think I've found a way out.

36:28.136 --> 36:29.511
Deep breath.

36:46.488 --> 36:48.781
Ah, Venice.

37:54.848 --> 37:56.890
Are you crazy? Don't go between them!

37:57.183 --> 37:59.393
Go between them? Are you crazy?

38:10.697 --> 38:12.406
I said go around!

38:12.657 --> 38:14.533
You said go between them!

38:14.617 --> 38:17.244
I said, don't go between them!

39:19.515 --> 39:20.641
No!

39:25.980 --> 39:27.648
Why are you trying to kill us?

39:27.732 --> 39:29.608
Because you're looking
for the Holy Grail.

39:30.109 --> 39:33.320
My father was looking for the Holy Grail.
Did you kill him too?

39:33.404 --> 39:34.404
No.

39:34.489 --> 39:36.323
Where is he?

39:36.783 --> 39:38.450
Talk or you're dead.

39:38.534 --> 39:40.160
Damn it, tell me!

39:40.745 --> 39:41.995
Tell me!

39:42.080 --> 39:44.623
If you don't let go, Dr. Jones,
we'll both die.

39:44.707 --> 39:46.208
Then we'll die.

39:46.376 --> 39:49.127
My soul is prepared. How's yours?

39:51.005 --> 39:52.422
This is your last chance.

39:52.548 --> 39:54.758
No, Dr. Jones, it's yours.

40:11.359 --> 40:13.819
All right, where's my father?

40:13.903 --> 40:16.738
If you let me go,
I will tell you where he is.

40:17.407 --> 40:18.699
Who are you?

40:19.158 --> 40:20.701
My name is Kazim.

40:20.785 --> 40:22.286
And why were you trying to kill me?

40:23.037 --> 40:27.040
The secret of the Grail has been safe
for a thousand years,

40:27.375 --> 40:29.126
and for all that time,

40:29.210 --> 40:31.169
the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword

40:31.254 --> 40:34.464
have been prepared
to do anything to keep it safe.

40:37.051 --> 40:39.052
Let me off at this jetty.

40:42.390 --> 40:46.560
Ask yourself, why do you
seek the Cup of Christ?

40:47.395 --> 40:50.022
Is it for His glory, or for yours?

40:51.274 --> 40:54.735
I didn't come for the Cup of Christ.
I came to find my father.

40:56.195 --> 40:58.989
In that case,
God be with you in your quest.

40:59.073 --> 41:01.241
Your father is being held
in the Castle of Brunwald,

41:01.326 --> 41:03.577
on the Austrian-German border.

41:12.420 --> 41:13.712
How's the head?

41:13.796 --> 41:16.214
It's better, now I've seen this.

41:17.342 --> 41:20.385
It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta"?

41:24.140 --> 41:25.390
The knights of the First Crusade

41:25.475 --> 41:28.769
laid siege to the city
of Alexandretta for over a year.

41:28.853 --> 41:31.104
The entire city was destroyed.

41:34.025 --> 41:37.444
The present city of Iskenderun
is built on its ruins.

41:38.780 --> 41:41.782
Marcus, you remember
what the Grail tablet said,

41:41.866 --> 41:43.533
"Across the desert
and through the mountain

41:43.618 --> 41:46.203
"to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."

41:48.998 --> 41:50.874
But where exactly?

41:50.958 --> 41:52.834
Your father would know.

41:54.796 --> 41:57.756
Your father did know.
Look. He made a map.

41:58.466 --> 42:00.425
He must have pieced it together
from clues scattered through

42:00.510 --> 42:02.677
the whole history of the Grail quest.

42:02.762 --> 42:03.762
A map with no names.

42:03.846 --> 42:07.641
Now, he knew there was a city
with an oasis due east, here.

42:07.725 --> 42:10.560
He knew the course turned south
through the desert to a river,

42:10.645 --> 42:12.479
and the river led
into the mountains, here.

42:12.563 --> 42:13.855
Straight to the canyon.

42:13.981 --> 42:16.441
He knew everything
except where to begin,

42:16.526 --> 42:18.318
the name of the city.

42:20.154 --> 42:21.571
Alexandretta.

42:22.156 --> 42:24.241
- Now we know.
- Yes. Now we know.

42:24.325 --> 42:26.910
Marcus, get hold of Sallah.
Tell him to meet you in Iskenderun.

42:26.994 --> 42:28.495
What about you?

42:28.579 --> 42:29.621
I'm going after Dad.

42:51.644 --> 42:52.727
Elsa?

42:58.776 --> 43:00.360
Elsa? Elsa?

43:12.039 --> 43:14.166
- My room...
- Mine, too.

43:15.042 --> 43:16.543
What were they looking for?

43:16.627 --> 43:17.711
This.

43:18.129 --> 43:19.713
The Grail diary?

43:21.382 --> 43:22.716
You had it?

43:23.718 --> 43:25.343
You didn't trust me.

43:25.428 --> 43:27.095
I didn't know you.

43:27.472 --> 43:29.681
At least I let you tag along.

43:29.932 --> 43:30.974
Oh, yes.

43:31.058 --> 43:33.977
Give them a flower,
and they'll follow you anywhere.

43:35.605 --> 43:37.814
Knock it off. You're not mad.

43:38.274 --> 43:39.399
No?

43:39.484 --> 43:42.110
No. You like the way I do things.

43:42.195 --> 43:44.154
It's lucky I don't do things the same way.

43:44.238 --> 43:47.032
You'd still be standing
at the Venice pier!

43:47.325 --> 43:50.327
Look, what do you think
is going on here?

43:50.411 --> 43:52.871
Since I met you,
I've nearly been incinerated,

43:52.955 --> 43:55.415
drowned, shot at,
and chopped into fish bait.

43:55.500 --> 43:57.000
We're caught in the middle
of something sinister here.

43:57.084 --> 44:00.045
My guess is Dad found out
more than he was looking for.

44:00.129 --> 44:03.423
And until I'm sure,
I'm going to continue to do things

44:03.508 --> 44:06.092
the way I think they should be done.

44:09.096 --> 44:11.097
How dare you kiss me!

44:17.271 --> 44:20.524
Leave me alone. I don't like fast women.

44:21.776 --> 44:24.694
And I hate arrogant men.

44:35.164 --> 44:36.706
Ah, Venice.

45:09.031 --> 45:10.699
What do you know about this place?

45:10.783 --> 45:13.868
I know the Brunwalds
are famous art collectors.

45:16.414 --> 45:17.956
What are you going to do?

45:18.124 --> 45:20.500
Don't know. I'll think of something.

45:28.217 --> 45:29.217
Yes?

45:29.302 --> 45:31.094
And not before time!

45:31.178 --> 45:33.638
Did you intend to leave us
standing on the doorstep all day?

45:33.723 --> 45:35.265
We're drenched!

45:36.267 --> 45:39.102
Now look, I've gone and caught a sniffle.

45:39.186 --> 45:40.437
Are you expected?

45:40.521 --> 45:43.273
Do not take that tone with me,
my good man.

45:43.357 --> 45:45.191
Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald

45:45.318 --> 45:48.862
that Lord Clarence MacDonald
and his lovely assistant

45:48.946 --> 45:51.281
are here to view the tapestries.

45:51.365 --> 45:52.532
Tapestries?

45:52.617 --> 45:54.117
Dear me, the man is dense.

45:54.201 --> 45:57.495
This is a castle, isn't it?
There are tapestries?

45:58.080 --> 45:59.914
This is a castle,

45:59.999 --> 46:02.542
and we have many tapestries.

46:03.085 --> 46:06.838
But if you are a Scottish lord,
then I am Mickey Mouse!

46:08.299 --> 46:09.716
How dare he?

46:36.786 --> 46:39.329
Nazis. I hate these guys.

46:52.802 --> 46:54.427
This one. I think he's in here.

46:54.512 --> 46:56.179
How do you know?

46:56.263 --> 46:58.014
Because it's wired.

47:26.127 --> 47:28.294
Indy? Indy?

47:28.796 --> 47:30.797
Don't worry. This is kid's play.

47:30.881 --> 47:32.674
I'll be right back.

47:57.324 --> 47:58.491
Junior?

47:59.785 --> 48:00.869
Yes, sir.

48:01.245 --> 48:02.912
It is you, Junior!

48:03.539 --> 48:05.415
Don't call me that, please.

48:05.499 --> 48:06.833
Well, what are you doing here?

48:07.084 --> 48:09.711
I came to get you. What do you thi...

48:19.180 --> 48:21.514
Late 14th century, Ming dynasty.

48:22.725 --> 48:24.142
It breaks the heart.

48:24.226 --> 48:26.561
And the head. You hit me, Dad.

48:26.645 --> 48:28.688
I'll never forgive myself.

48:29.231 --> 48:31.107
Don't worry, I'm fine.

48:33.027 --> 48:34.360
Thank God.

48:37.490 --> 48:38.823
It's fake.

48:40.534 --> 48:43.244
See, you can tell by the cross section.

48:44.705 --> 48:46.206
No!

48:46.332 --> 48:48.833
Dad, get your stuff.
We've got to get out of here.

48:48.918 --> 48:53.004
Well, I'm sorry about your head, though,
but I thought you were one of them.

48:53.088 --> 48:55.715
Dad, they come in through the doors.

48:56.383 --> 48:57.634
Good point.

48:58.511 --> 49:00.053
But better safe than sorry.

49:00.387 --> 49:02.138
So I was wrong this time.

49:02.223 --> 49:05.683
But, by God, I wasn't wrong
when I mailed you my diary.

49:05.768 --> 49:06.893
You obviously got it.

49:09.730 --> 49:11.689
I got it, and I used it.

49:12.566 --> 49:14.859
We found the entrance
to the catacombs.

49:14.944 --> 49:16.444
Through the library?

49:17.112 --> 49:18.279
Right.

49:21.742 --> 49:23.076
I knew it.

49:23.494 --> 49:25.078
And the tomb of Sir Richard?

49:26.747 --> 49:27.997
Found it.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.376
He was actually there?

49:33.921 --> 49:35.547
You saw him?

49:35.631 --> 49:37.757
Well, what was left of him.

49:38.175 --> 49:39.801
And his shield,

49:40.678 --> 49:43.596
the inscription on Sir Richard's shield?

49:44.682 --> 49:45.974
"Alexandretta."

49:46.058 --> 49:48.935
Alexandretta! Of course!

49:49.937 --> 49:53.106
On the pilgrim trail
from the Eastern Empire.

49:56.151 --> 49:57.861
Junior, you did it.

49:58.487 --> 50:00.113
No, Dad. You did.

50:00.447 --> 50:01.865
Forty years.

50:03.158 --> 50:05.493
If only I could have been with you.

50:05.578 --> 50:07.370
There were rats, Dad.

50:08.080 --> 50:09.163
Rats?

50:09.248 --> 50:10.665
Yeah, big ones.

50:10.749 --> 50:12.375
What do the Nazis want with you, Dad?

50:12.459 --> 50:14.961
- They wanted my diary.
- Yeah?

50:15.212 --> 50:19.591
I knew I had to get that book
as far away from me as I possibly could.

50:22.553 --> 50:23.595
Yeah.

50:28.434 --> 50:29.767
Dr. Jones.

50:29.894 --> 50:30.977
Yes?

50:34.189 --> 50:35.982
I will take the book now.

50:38.235 --> 50:39.444
What book?

50:39.737 --> 50:41.946
You have the diary in your pocket.

50:43.490 --> 50:44.741
You dolt!

50:45.075 --> 50:47.535
Do you think my son
would be that stupid

50:47.620 --> 50:50.997
that he would bring my diary
all the way back here?

50:52.541 --> 50:54.042
You didn't, did you?

50:55.210 --> 50:57.420
- You didn't bring it, did you?
- Well...

50:57.838 --> 50:59.380
You did.

50:59.757 --> 51:01.424
Look, can we discuss this later?

51:01.508 --> 51:03.551
I should have mailed it
to the Marx Brothers.

51:03.636 --> 51:05.178
Will you take it easy?

51:05.262 --> 51:06.679
Take it easy?

51:06.764 --> 51:08.765
Why do you think I sent it home
in the first place?

51:08.849 --> 51:10.433
So it wouldn't fall into their hands!

51:10.601 --> 51:12.518
I came here to save you!

51:12.603 --> 51:13.603
Oh, yeah?

51:13.687 --> 51:16.105
And who's gonna come
to save you, Junior?

51:16.190 --> 51:17.398
I told you...

51:24.907 --> 51:26.866
...don't call me Junior!

51:29.536 --> 51:31.204
Look what you did!

51:32.873 --> 51:35.166
I can't believe what you did...

51:37.586 --> 51:39.253
Elsa? Elsa?

51:39.338 --> 51:41.506
That's far enough.
Put down the gun, Dr. Jones.

51:41.590 --> 51:43.633
Put down the gun, or the Fräulein dies.

51:43.759 --> 51:46.010
- But she's one of them.
- Indy, please!

51:46.178 --> 51:47.971
- She's a Nazi.
- What?

51:48.055 --> 51:49.305
- Trust me.
- Indy, no!

51:49.390 --> 51:50.390
I will kill her!

51:50.557 --> 51:53.184
- Yeah? Go ahead!
- No! Don't shoot!

51:53.978 --> 51:55.395
Don't worry. He won't.

51:56.188 --> 51:57.981
Indy, please! Do what he says!

51:58.065 --> 51:59.983
And don't listen to her.

52:00.067 --> 52:01.818
Enough! She dies!

52:01.986 --> 52:03.444
Wait! Wait...

52:11.078 --> 52:12.412
I'm sorry.

52:12.871 --> 52:15.248
No, don't be.

52:28.846 --> 52:31.848
But you should have
listened to your father.

52:49.783 --> 52:52.869
She ransacked her own room,
and I fell for it.

52:55.080 --> 53:01.085
How did you know she was a Nazi?

53:01.295 --> 53:03.212
She talks in her sleep.

53:13.307 --> 53:15.558
I didn't trust her. Why did you?

53:15.851 --> 53:18.436
Because he didn't take my advice.

53:25.194 --> 53:26.944
Donovan.

53:27.029 --> 53:30.823
Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody,
Dr. Jones?

53:31.075 --> 53:33.409
I misjudged you, Walter.

53:33.494 --> 53:36.579
I knew you would sell your mother
for an Etruscan vase,

53:36.663 --> 53:40.124
but I didn't know you would
sell your country and your soul

53:40.501 --> 53:42.168
to the slime of humanity.

53:44.088 --> 53:45.671
Dr. Schneider,

53:45.756 --> 53:48.341
there are pages torn out of this.

53:57.017 --> 54:01.187
This book contained a map,
a map with no names,

54:01.271 --> 54:03.397
precise directions from the unknown city

54:03.482 --> 54:05.399
to the secret
Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

54:05.484 --> 54:06.484
So it did.

54:06.568 --> 54:08.319
Where are these missing pages,
this map?

54:08.403 --> 54:09.779
We must have these pages back.

54:09.863 --> 54:11.114
You're wasting your breath.

54:11.198 --> 54:12.990
He won't tell us,

54:13.075 --> 54:14.909
and he doesn't have to.

54:15.577 --> 54:18.538
It's perfectly obvious
where the pages are.

54:19.289 --> 54:21.040
He's given them to Marcus Brody.

54:21.125 --> 54:22.166
Marcus?

54:22.543 --> 54:24.627
You didn't drag poor Marcus along,
did you?

54:24.711 --> 54:26.129
He's not up to the challenge.

54:26.213 --> 54:27.672
He sticks out like a sore thumb.

54:27.756 --> 54:28.881
We'll find him.

54:28.966 --> 54:30.633
The hell you will.

54:30.717 --> 54:32.385
He's got a two-day head start on you,

54:32.469 --> 54:33.886
which is more than he needs.

54:34.388 --> 54:36.305
Brody's got friends
in every town and village

54:36.390 --> 54:37.473
from here to the Sudan.

54:37.558 --> 54:40.226
He speaks a dozen languages,
knows every local custom.

54:40.310 --> 54:42.145
He'll blend in, disappear.

54:42.229 --> 54:44.063
You'll never see him again.

54:44.148 --> 54:46.732
With any luck,
he's got the Grail already.

54:47.901 --> 54:49.986
Does anyone here speak English?

54:50.070 --> 54:51.154
Or even ancient Greek?

54:51.238 --> 54:52.405
Water? No, thank you, sir.

54:52.489 --> 54:53.823
No. Fish make love in it.

54:54.741 --> 54:57.160
Goodness me. Thank you so much.
No, I don't like that.

54:57.244 --> 54:58.411
No, I really don't want...

54:58.495 --> 55:00.663
No, no, thank you very much.

55:00.747 --> 55:02.748
No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.

55:03.250 --> 55:05.960
Does anyone understand
a word I'm saying here?

55:06.044 --> 55:07.503
Mr. Brody!

55:07.588 --> 55:08.754
Sallah. What a relief.

55:08.839 --> 55:11.174
Marcus Brody, sir.

55:11.258 --> 55:12.967
- But where is Indy?
- He's in Austria.

55:13.051 --> 55:14.510
A slight detour.

55:14.595 --> 55:15.636
You are on your own?

55:15.721 --> 55:18.431
Yes, but don't panic.
Everything's under control.

55:18.849 --> 55:20.766
Have you, have you
arranged our supplies?

55:20.851 --> 55:22.685
Yes, of course.
But where are we going?

55:22.769 --> 55:24.228
This map will show you.

55:24.313 --> 55:26.272
It was drawn by...

55:26.773 --> 55:28.191
Mr. Brody.

55:28.775 --> 55:30.109
Welcome to Iskenderun.

55:30.277 --> 55:32.195
The director
of the Museum of Antiquities

55:32.279 --> 55:33.404
has sent a car for you.

55:33.488 --> 55:35.781
Well, your servant, sir.

55:36.033 --> 55:37.116
And I am his.

55:37.951 --> 55:39.160
Follow me, please.

55:39.620 --> 55:41.204
My reputation precedes me.

55:41.288 --> 55:43.456
There is no museum in Iskenderun.

55:43.540 --> 55:44.916
Papers, please.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.376
Papers? Of course.

55:47.461 --> 55:48.920
- Run.
- Yes.

55:49.004 --> 55:50.755
Papers. Got it here.

55:50.839 --> 55:52.465
Just finished reading it myself.

55:52.549 --> 55:54.717
- Run.
- Yes.

55:54.801 --> 55:56.719
Egyptian Mail, morning edition. Run.

55:56.803 --> 55:58.012
Did you say...

55:58.138 --> 55:59.555
Run!

56:14.404 --> 56:16.239
Okay, okay, quick, quick, quick!

56:16.323 --> 56:19.325
Find the back door! Find the back door!

56:32.589 --> 56:34.548
Intolerable.

56:37.010 --> 56:38.761
Dr. Schneider. Message from Berlin.

56:38.845 --> 56:40.638
You must return immediately.

56:40.722 --> 56:43.557
- A rally at the Institute of Aryan Culture.
- So?

56:43.642 --> 56:47.812
Your presence on the platform
is requested at the highest level.

56:47.896 --> 56:50.898
Thank you, Herr Oberst.
I will meet you at Iskenderun.

56:50.983 --> 56:52.900
Take this diary
to the Reichmuseum in Berlin.

56:52.985 --> 56:55.528
It will show them our progress,
ahead of schedule.

56:55.612 --> 56:58.030
Without the map,
I'm afraid it's no better than a souvenir.

56:58.115 --> 56:59.365
Let me kill them now.

56:59.449 --> 57:00.533
No.

57:00.617 --> 57:02.451
If we fail to recover
the pages from Brody,

57:02.536 --> 57:04.120
we'll need them alive.

57:04.204 --> 57:06.706
Always do what the doctor orders.

57:14.631 --> 57:16.048
Don't look at me like that.

57:16.925 --> 57:18.718
We both wanted the Grail.

57:18.802 --> 57:20.720
I would have done anything to get it.

57:20.804 --> 57:22.805
You would have done the same.

57:22.889 --> 57:24.807
I'm sorry you think so.

57:36.069 --> 57:39.613
I can't forget how wonderful it was.

57:39.698 --> 57:40.740
Thank you.

57:40.824 --> 57:42.742
It was rather wonderful.

57:51.752 --> 57:53.753
Dr. Schneider.

57:55.464 --> 57:56.881
Your car is waiting.

58:05.057 --> 58:07.099
That's how Austrians say good-bye.

58:13.607 --> 58:17.526
And this is how we say good-bye
in Germany, Dr. Jones.

58:25.494 --> 58:27.703
I liked the Austrian way better.

58:27.788 --> 58:29.455
So did I.

58:29.790 --> 58:31.124
Let's try and get these ropes loose.

58:31.208 --> 58:34.043
We've got to get to Marcus
before the Nazis do.

58:34.127 --> 58:37.838
You said he had two days' start.
That he would blend in. Disappear.

58:37.923 --> 58:39.382
Are you kidding? I made that up.

58:39.466 --> 58:42.676
You know Marcus.
He got lost once in his own museum.

58:45.055 --> 58:47.723
Can you try and reach
my left jacket pocket?

58:48.975 --> 58:50.184
What am I looking for?

58:50.268 --> 58:51.727
My lucky charm.

58:53.313 --> 58:54.814
Feels like a cigarette lighter.

58:56.316 --> 58:57.525
Try and burn through the ropes.

58:59.444 --> 59:00.653
Very good.

59:25.387 --> 59:26.595
I ought to tell you something.

59:26.680 --> 59:29.765
Don't get sentimental now, Dad.
Save it till we get out of here.

59:29.850 --> 59:31.183
The floor's on fire.

59:31.393 --> 59:32.852
- See?
- What?

59:33.687 --> 59:34.812
And the chair.

59:35.188 --> 59:37.273
Move! Move it out of here! Go!

59:37.357 --> 59:39.150
It's scorching the table! Fast!

59:39.234 --> 59:40.276
- Move!
- Okay!

59:54.541 --> 59:57.042
Well, we have Marcus Brody,

59:57.127 --> 59:59.378
but more important, we have the map.

01:00:03.717 --> 01:00:05.301
"By the personal command
of the Führer.

01:00:05.385 --> 01:00:07.386
"Secrecy essential to success.

01:00:07.471 --> 01:00:09.889
"Eliminate the American conspirators."

01:00:10.724 --> 01:00:14.059
Germany has declared war
on the Jones boys.

01:00:19.649 --> 01:00:23.319
- Dad!
- What?

01:00:23.403 --> 01:00:25.029
Head for the fireplace!

01:00:38.168 --> 01:00:40.836
I think I can get these ropes off.

01:00:53.350 --> 01:00:55.434
Our situation has not improved.

01:00:55.519 --> 01:00:57.770
Listen, Dad, I'm almost free.

01:01:13.411 --> 01:01:15.579
Alarm!

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:25.798
This is intolerable.

01:01:26.466 --> 01:01:27.550
I'm out, Dad.

01:01:27.634 --> 01:01:29.385
Well done, boy.

01:02:05.547 --> 01:02:07.298
Come on, Dad.

01:02:13.555 --> 01:02:15.347
Dead end.

01:02:15.432 --> 01:02:16.682
There's got to be a...

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:19.393
A secret door or a...

01:02:19.477 --> 01:02:20.644
Passageway or something.

01:02:20.854 --> 01:02:24.023
I find that if I just sit down and think...

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.194
Dad!

01:02:32.699 --> 01:02:34.825
...the solution presents itself.

01:02:42.584 --> 01:02:45.210
Great. More boats.

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:51.842
You say this has been
just another typical day for you, huh?

01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:56.430
No! But better than most.

01:02:58.933 --> 01:03:00.976
Come on, Dad. Come on.

01:03:01.061 --> 01:03:02.770
What about the boat?

01:03:02.854 --> 01:03:04.104
We're not going on the boat?

01:03:19.245 --> 01:03:20.287
Jones!

01:04:32.986 --> 01:04:34.027
Halt! Halt!

01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:38.050
- Stop!
- What?

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:40.219
Stop! Stop!

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:44.556
You're going the wrong way.
We have to get to Berlin.

01:05:44.641 --> 01:05:46.099
Brody's this way.

01:05:46.184 --> 01:05:47.976
My diary's in Berlin.

01:05:48.061 --> 01:05:50.020
We don't need the diary, Dad.

01:05:50.104 --> 01:05:51.522
Marcus has the map.

01:05:51.606 --> 01:05:54.817
There is more in the diary
than just the map.

01:05:55.026 --> 01:05:57.820
All right, Dad. Tell me.

01:05:59.572 --> 01:06:04.117
Well, he who finds the Grail
must face the final challenge.

01:06:04.202 --> 01:06:05.994
What final challenge?

01:06:06.079 --> 01:06:08.872
Three devices of such lethal cunning.

01:06:08.957 --> 01:06:10.582
- Booby traps?
- Yes.

01:06:12.043 --> 01:06:15.504
But I found the clues that
will safely take us through,

01:06:15.588 --> 01:06:17.798
in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.

01:06:17.882 --> 01:06:19.508
Well, what are they?

01:06:23.054 --> 01:06:24.429
Can't you remember?

01:06:26.391 --> 01:06:30.310
I wrote them down in my diary
so that I wouldn't have to remember.

01:06:30.728 --> 01:06:33.939
Half the German army's on our tail,
and you want me to go to Berlin?

01:06:34.023 --> 01:06:36.024
- Into the lion's den?
- Yes.

01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:38.277
The only thing that matters is the Grail.

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:39.820
What about Marcus?

01:06:39.904 --> 01:06:41.488
Marcus would agree with me.

01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:44.324
Two selfless martyrs.

01:06:44.409 --> 01:06:45.742
Jesus Christ.

01:06:49.497 --> 01:06:52.082
That's for blasphemy.

01:06:54.836 --> 01:06:58.463
The quest for the Grail
is not archeology.

01:06:59.966 --> 01:07:02.134
It's a race against evil.

01:07:02.468 --> 01:07:05.012
If it is captured by the Nazis,

01:07:05.096 --> 01:07:08.724
the armies of darkness
will march all over the face of the Earth.

01:07:08.808 --> 01:07:09.892
Do you understand me?

01:07:11.644 --> 01:07:13.896
This is an obsession, Dad.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:17.232
I never understood it. Never.

01:07:19.485 --> 01:07:21.403
Neither did Mom.

01:07:21.487 --> 01:07:23.155
Yes, she did.

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:25.157
Only too well.

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:29.995
Unfortunately, she kept
her illness from me

01:07:31.456 --> 01:07:32.998
until all I could do was mourn her.

01:08:35.728 --> 01:08:39.064
My boy, we are pilgrims
in an unholy land.

01:09:08.845 --> 01:09:10.761
Fräulein Doctor.

01:09:11.264 --> 01:09:13.180
- Where is it?
- How did you get here?

01:09:13.265 --> 01:09:15.308
Where is it? I want it.

01:09:18.563 --> 01:09:21.106
You came back for the book? Why?

01:09:21.858 --> 01:09:23.692
My father didn't want it incinerated.

01:09:23.776 --> 01:09:25.402
Is that what you think of me?

01:09:25.486 --> 01:09:27.863
I believe in the Grail, not the swastika.

01:09:27.947 --> 01:09:29.281
But you stood up to be counted

01:09:29.365 --> 01:09:31.700
with the enemy of everything
that the Grail stands for.

01:09:31.783 --> 01:09:33.326
Who gives a damn what you think?

01:09:33.411 --> 01:09:35.453
You do.

01:09:35.537 --> 01:09:38.622
All I have to do is squeeze.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:41.460
All I have to do is scream.

01:09:50.970 --> 01:09:54.055
I've got it. Let's get the hell out of here.

01:11:06.754 --> 01:11:07.879
- What did you get?
- I don't know.

01:11:07.964 --> 01:11:09.381
First available flight out of Germany.

01:11:09.507 --> 01:11:11.216
Good.

01:11:37.243 --> 01:11:39.578
Well, we made it.

01:11:40.705 --> 01:11:43.582
When we're airborne,
with Germany behind us,

01:11:43.666 --> 01:11:46.001
then I'll share that sentiment.

01:11:46.085 --> 01:11:47.711
Relax.

01:12:33.591 --> 01:12:35.550
Tickets, please.

01:12:46.687 --> 01:12:50.148
Guten Tag, Herr Jones.

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:56.071
Tickets, please.

01:13:07.291 --> 01:13:09.209
We should get out of here.

01:13:11.295 --> 01:13:12.837
No ticket.

01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:16.758
Ticket.

01:13:16.842 --> 01:13:19.135
- Ticket!
- Ticket!

01:13:36.529 --> 01:13:38.113
You know,

01:13:38.197 --> 01:13:42.284
sharing your adventures is
an interesting experience.

01:13:43.411 --> 01:13:45.203
That's not all we shared.

01:13:45.288 --> 01:13:47.622
It's disgraceful.
You're old enough to be her fa...

01:13:47.707 --> 01:13:49.124
Her grandfather.

01:13:49.709 --> 01:13:51.209
Well, I'm as human as the next man.

01:13:51.294 --> 01:13:53.211
I was the next man.

01:13:56.299 --> 01:13:57.757
Of course. Well...

01:13:57.842 --> 01:13:59.551
Ships that pass in the night.

01:14:00.219 --> 01:14:03.722
Do you remember the last time
we had a quiet drink?

01:14:05.516 --> 01:14:07.517
I had a milkshake.

01:14:08.436 --> 01:14:10.353
What did we talk about?

01:14:11.439 --> 01:14:13.231
We didn't talk.

01:14:14.275 --> 01:14:16.234
We never talked.

01:14:17.903 --> 01:14:20.322
Do I detect a rebuke?

01:14:21.866 --> 01:14:24.659
A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad.

01:14:24.744 --> 01:14:27.287
It was a lonely way to grow up.
For you, too.

01:14:27.371 --> 01:14:28.997
If you'd been an ordinary,
average father,

01:14:29.081 --> 01:14:31.082
like the other guys' dads,
you'd have understood that.

01:14:32.043 --> 01:14:34.377
Actually, I was a wonderful father.

01:14:34.462 --> 01:14:36.004
When?

01:14:36.714 --> 01:14:39.132
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed?

01:14:39.216 --> 01:14:40.675
Wash your ears? Do your homework?

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:45.722
No. I respected your privacy,
and I taught you self-reliance.

01:14:45.806 --> 01:14:48.391
What you taught me was
that I was less important to you

01:14:48.476 --> 01:14:51.853
than people who'd been dead
for 500 years in another country.

01:14:51.937 --> 01:14:53.897
And I learned it so well

01:14:53.981 --> 01:14:56.191
that we've hardly spoken for 20 years.

01:14:56.275 --> 01:14:59.110
You left just when
you were becoming interesting.

01:14:59.195 --> 01:15:00.278
Unbelievable.

01:15:00.363 --> 01:15:02.155
- Dad, how can you...
- Very well.

01:15:02.239 --> 01:15:04.199
I'm here now.

01:15:05.576 --> 01:15:07.202
What do you want to talk about?

01:15:08.788 --> 01:15:10.372
Well, I...

01:15:18.464 --> 01:15:20.215
I can't think of anything.

01:15:20.591 --> 01:15:22.550
Then what are you complaining about?

01:15:24.178 --> 01:15:26.096
Look, we have work to do.

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:32.769
When we get to Alexandretta,
we will face three challenges.

01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:38.233
The first, "The Breath of God.
Only the penitent man will pass."

01:15:38.317 --> 01:15:41.444
Second, "The Word of God.

01:15:41.529 --> 01:15:44.572
"Only in the footsteps of God
will he proceed."

01:15:44.657 --> 01:15:46.991
Third, "The Path of God.

01:15:47.451 --> 01:15:52.831
"Only in the leap from the lion's head
will he prove his worth."

01:15:54.333 --> 01:15:56.418
What does that mean?

01:15:56.502 --> 01:15:59.421
I don't know. We'll find out.

01:16:06.679 --> 01:16:09.222
We're turning around.

01:16:09.306 --> 01:16:11.224
They're taking us back to Germany.

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:19.774
Well, I thought it would
take them a lot longer

01:16:19.859 --> 01:16:21.109
to figure out the radio was dead.

01:16:21.193 --> 01:16:22.861
Come on, Dad. Move!

01:16:27.408 --> 01:16:29.659
Come on, Dad. Come on!

01:16:43.299 --> 01:16:45.383
I didn't know you could fly a plane.

01:16:45.468 --> 01:16:46.551
Fly, yes.

01:16:48.762 --> 01:16:50.722
Land, no.

01:17:15.039 --> 01:17:16.873
Dad, you're going to have to
use the machine gun.

01:17:16.957 --> 01:17:18.708
Get it ready.

01:17:20.085 --> 01:17:21.461
Eleven o'clock!

01:17:22.213 --> 01:17:23.796
Dad, eleven o'clock!

01:17:25.508 --> 01:17:27.759
What happens at eleven o'clock?

01:17:27.843 --> 01:17:29.511
Twelve, eleven, ten.

01:17:29.595 --> 01:17:32.263
Eleven o'clock, fire!

01:17:57.873 --> 01:18:00.583
Dad, are we hit?

01:18:00.668 --> 01:18:02.293
More or less.

01:18:02.836 --> 01:18:04.712
Son, I'm sorry.

01:18:04.797 --> 01:18:06.256
They got us.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:10.468
Hang on, Dad. We're going in!

01:18:23.524 --> 01:18:25.984
- Nice landing.
- Thanks.

01:18:41.292 --> 01:18:42.589
Those people are trying to kill us!

01:18:42.626 --> 01:18:44.377
I know, Dad!

01:18:44.461 --> 01:18:47.672
Well. It's a new experience for me.

01:18:48.007 --> 01:18:49.632
It happens to me all the time.

01:19:20.372 --> 01:19:22.081
This is intolerable!

01:19:23.459 --> 01:19:24.834
This could be close.

01:19:34.053 --> 01:19:35.720
Faster, boy! Faster!

01:19:51.445 --> 01:19:53.738
Well, they don't come
any closer than that!

01:20:09.672 --> 01:20:12.840
Dad, he's coming back!

01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:02.056
I suddenly
remembered my Charlemagne.

01:21:02.141 --> 01:21:04.976
"Let my armies be
the rocks and the trees

01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:07.311
"and the birds in the sky."

01:21:25.122 --> 01:21:28.541
These pages are taken from
Professor Jones' diary, Your Highness,

01:21:28.625 --> 01:21:29.917
and they include a map

01:21:30.002 --> 01:21:33.004
that pinpoints
the exact location of the Grail.

01:21:33.088 --> 01:21:35.840
As you can see,
the Grail is all but in our hands.

01:21:35.924 --> 01:21:37.133
However, Your Highness,

01:21:37.217 --> 01:21:40.136
we would not think of crossing your soil
without your permission,

01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:42.221
nor of removing the Grail
from your borders

01:21:42.306 --> 01:21:45.349
without suitable compensation.

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:50.146
What have you brought?

01:21:57.780 --> 01:22:00.323
Precious valuables, Your Highness,

01:22:00.407 --> 01:22:04.619
donated by some of the finest families
in all of Germany.

01:22:09.792 --> 01:22:12.585
Rolls-Royce Phantom Two.

01:22:12.669 --> 01:22:16.798
Four-point-three liter, 30 horsepower,
six-cylinder engine,

01:22:16.882 --> 01:22:19.675
with Stromberg downdraft carburetor.

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:23.054
Can go from zero to
100 kilometers an hour

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:25.973
in 12.5 seconds.

01:22:26.058 --> 01:22:27.600
And I even like the color.

01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:31.103
The keys are in the ignition,
Your Highness.

01:22:32.439 --> 01:22:35.316
You shall have camels, horses,

01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.819
an armed escort, provisions,

01:22:37.903 --> 01:22:40.571
desert vehicles and tanks.

01:22:40.656 --> 01:22:42.406
You're welcome.

01:22:58.173 --> 01:22:59.298
We have no time to lose.

01:22:59.383 --> 01:23:01.926
Indiana Jones
and his father have escaped.

01:23:04.930 --> 01:23:06.514
We go this way.

01:23:06.682 --> 01:23:08.182
Get that camel out of the way.

01:23:10.686 --> 01:23:12.895
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?

01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:15.481
They set out across the desert
this afternoon.

01:23:15.566 --> 01:23:18.818
I believe they took Mr. Brody with them.

01:23:20.070 --> 01:23:22.321
Now they have the map.

01:23:23.782 --> 01:23:25.408
And in this sort of race,

01:23:25.492 --> 01:23:28.369
there's no silver medal
for finishing second.

01:23:50.809 --> 01:23:53.269
Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?

01:23:53.353 --> 01:23:55.229
I'd rather spit in your face.

01:23:55.314 --> 01:23:57.815
But as I haven't got any spit...

01:24:00.193 --> 01:24:03.070
Must be within three or four miles.

01:24:03.155 --> 01:24:05.740
Otherwise we are off the map.

01:24:07.242 --> 01:24:10.870
Well, Marcus,
we are on the brink of the recovery of

01:24:10.954 --> 01:24:14.582
the greatest artifact
in the history of mankind.

01:24:14.666 --> 01:24:18.461
You're meddling with powers
you cannot possibly comprehend.

01:24:25.427 --> 01:24:27.470
I see Brody.

01:24:27.846 --> 01:24:29.263
He seems okay.

01:24:32.351 --> 01:24:34.977
They've got a tank.

01:24:40.442 --> 01:24:42.276
Six-pound gun.

01:24:42.361 --> 01:24:44.236
What do you think you're doing there?
Get down!

01:24:45.155 --> 01:24:47.198
Dad, we're well out of range.

01:24:57.501 --> 01:24:58.668
That car belonged to my brother-in-law.

01:24:58.752 --> 01:25:00.294
Come on, come on!

01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:02.630
I can't see anyone up there.

01:25:02.714 --> 01:25:03.965
Maybe it wasn't even Jones.

01:25:04.049 --> 01:25:06.300
No, it is him, all right.

01:25:06.385 --> 01:25:08.010
He's here somewhere.

01:25:09.054 --> 01:25:11.013
Put Brody in the tank.

01:25:17.938 --> 01:25:20.731
Well, in this sun,

01:25:20.816 --> 01:25:23.150
without transportation,
they're as good as dead.

01:25:32.744 --> 01:25:34.078
It's Jones, all right.

01:25:38.583 --> 01:25:40.668
- Now, who are all these people?
- Who cares?

01:25:40.752 --> 01:25:42.586
As long as
they're keeping Donovan busy.

01:25:43.422 --> 01:25:47.008
Dad, you stay here while Sallah and I
organize some transportation.

01:26:12.159 --> 01:26:14.159
- I'm going after those horses.
- I'll take the camels.

01:26:14.202 --> 01:26:15.786
- I don't need camels.
- But, Indy...

01:26:15.871 --> 01:26:17.288
No camels.

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:29.675
Who is he?

01:26:31.261 --> 01:26:33.387
A messenger from God.

01:26:34.848 --> 01:26:37.183
For the unrighteous,

01:26:37.267 --> 01:26:40.853
the Cup of Life
holds everlasting damnation.

01:26:59.998 --> 01:27:02.083
Marcus!

01:27:03.668 --> 01:27:05.836
"Genius of the Restoration..."

01:27:06.296 --> 01:27:08.672
"Aid our own resuscitation."

01:27:08.757 --> 01:27:09.965
Henry, what are you doing here?

01:27:10.050 --> 01:27:11.425
It's a rescue, old boy. Come on.

01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:19.433
Search him.

01:27:20.352 --> 01:27:22.186
What is in this book?

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:25.689
That miserable little diary of yours.

01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:28.192
We have the map. The book is useless.

01:27:28.276 --> 01:27:31.153
And yet you come all the way back
to Berlin to get it.

01:27:31.238 --> 01:27:32.863
Why?

01:27:32.948 --> 01:27:34.990
What are you hiding?

01:27:35.367 --> 01:27:38.577
What does the diary tell you
that it doesn't tell us?

01:27:39.788 --> 01:27:43.791
It tells me that goose-stepping morons
like yourself

01:27:43.875 --> 01:27:46.961
should try reading books
instead of burning them.

01:27:47.420 --> 01:27:48.546
Colonel!

01:27:48.630 --> 01:27:50.631
Jones is getting away.

01:27:50.715 --> 01:27:51.799
I think not,

01:27:52.092 --> 01:27:53.217
Herr Donovan.

01:27:53.426 --> 01:27:56.262
Not that Jones, the other Jones!

01:28:05.230 --> 01:28:07.648
Sallah, I said no camels!

01:28:07.732 --> 01:28:09.984
That's five camels. Can't you count?

01:28:10.068 --> 01:28:12.403
Compensation for
my brother-in-law's car.

01:28:12.487 --> 01:28:14.530
Indy, your father and Brody...

01:28:14.823 --> 01:28:15.990
Where's my father?

01:28:16.074 --> 01:28:17.241
They have them.

01:28:17.534 --> 01:28:19.577
In the belly of that steel beast.

01:28:42.767 --> 01:28:43.809
Fire!

01:30:44.764 --> 01:30:47.057
Dad! Dad!

01:30:47.142 --> 01:30:49.393
- Dad!
- Junior?

01:30:49.477 --> 01:30:50.811
Junior?

01:30:51.062 --> 01:30:52.229
Junior!

01:32:07.806 --> 01:32:11.266
Dad!

01:32:11.393 --> 01:32:13.143
Dad! Get out!

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:34.892
Henry, the pen...

01:33:35.143 --> 01:33:36.560
- What?
- But don't you see?

01:33:36.644 --> 01:33:39.897
The pen is mightier than the sword.

01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:03.837
Look what you did.

01:34:03.922 --> 01:34:05.422
It's war.

01:34:11.221 --> 01:34:13.764
Didn't I tell you it was a rescue?

01:35:17.787 --> 01:35:19.871
- Dad!
- Yeah?

01:35:20.832 --> 01:35:22.332
You call this archeology?

01:35:22.417 --> 01:35:23.584
Get out of there, Dad.

01:35:34.887 --> 01:35:36.597
How does one get off this thing?

01:35:43.521 --> 01:35:44.646
Where's Marcus?

01:35:49.319 --> 01:35:50.902
Dad!

01:35:54.324 --> 01:35:55.490
Hang on, Dad!

01:36:02.373 --> 01:36:04.416
Father of Indy, give me your hand!

01:36:05.209 --> 01:36:06.293
Sallah!

01:36:06.377 --> 01:36:07.669
Get Dad!

01:36:07.754 --> 01:36:09.546
Give me your hand!

01:36:58.304 --> 01:37:00.097
Junior!

01:37:01.974 --> 01:37:04.059
Indy!

01:37:12.610 --> 01:37:14.736
Oh, God.

01:37:14.821 --> 01:37:16.947
I've lost him.

01:37:20.535 --> 01:37:23.161
And I never told him anything.

01:37:25.665 --> 01:37:28.208
I just wasn't ready, Marcus.

01:37:29.210 --> 01:37:31.878
Five minutes would have been enough.

01:38:08.833 --> 01:38:11.501
I thought I'd lost you, boy!

01:38:13.004 --> 01:38:15.172
I thought you had too, sir.

01:38:28.186 --> 01:38:29.728
Well...

01:38:31.981 --> 01:38:35.025
Well done. Come on.

01:38:38.070 --> 01:38:39.863
Let's go, then.

01:38:42.366 --> 01:38:45.327
Why are you sitting there resting
when we're so near the end?

01:38:45.411 --> 01:38:47.370
Come on, let's go!

01:38:59.884 --> 01:39:03.637
The Canyon of the Crescent Moon.

01:41:31.202 --> 01:41:32.494
Helmut, another volunteer!

01:42:01.691 --> 01:42:04.359
I never expected to see you again.

01:42:04.443 --> 01:42:06.861
I'm like a bad penny, I always turn up.

01:42:06.946 --> 01:42:10.615
Step back now, Dr. Schneider.
Give Dr. Jones some room.

01:42:11.367 --> 01:42:13.660
He's going to recover the Grail for us.

01:42:16.747 --> 01:42:20.959
Impossible? What do you say, Jones?
Ready to go down in history?

01:42:21.043 --> 01:42:24.129
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?

01:42:24.213 --> 01:42:25.755
The Nazis?

01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:28.258
Is that the limit of your vision?

01:42:28.634 --> 01:42:32.303
The Nazis want to write themselves
into the Grail legend,

01:42:32.388 --> 01:42:33.805
take on the world.

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:36.433
Well, they're welcome.

01:42:37.601 --> 01:42:39.686
But I want the Grail itself.

01:42:39.770 --> 01:42:42.897
The cup that gives everlasting life.

01:42:43.899 --> 01:42:46.484
Hitler can have the world,
but he can't take it with him.

01:42:47.528 --> 01:42:51.448
I'm going to be drinking my own health
when he's gone the way of the dodo.

01:42:55.411 --> 01:42:57.662
The Grail is mine,

01:42:57.747 --> 01:42:59.706
and you're going to get it for me.

01:42:59.790 --> 01:43:01.791
Shooting me won't get you anywhere.

01:43:02.251 --> 01:43:04.002
You know something, Dr. Jones?

01:43:04.086 --> 01:43:06.004
You're absolutely right.

01:43:08.674 --> 01:43:12.135
Dad?

01:43:12.803 --> 01:43:13.887
Junior...

01:43:13.971 --> 01:43:15.764
- No!
- Get back!

01:43:33.783 --> 01:43:35.825
You can't save him when you're dead!

01:43:36.202 --> 01:43:37.452
The healing power of the Grail

01:43:37.536 --> 01:43:39.579
is the only thing
that can save your father now.

01:43:39.663 --> 01:43:43.124
It's time to ask yourself
what you believe.

01:44:18.661 --> 01:44:20.662
"The Breath of God.

01:44:21.872 --> 01:44:24.541
"Only the penitent man will pass."

01:44:25.835 --> 01:44:28.378
"The penitent man will pass."

01:44:46.438 --> 01:44:49.732
The penitent man will pass.

01:44:49.817 --> 01:44:51.860
The penitent man...

01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:59.450
"Only the penitent man will pass."

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.621
The penitent man will pass.
The penitent, penitent...

01:45:03.706 --> 01:45:04.998
The penitent man...

01:45:05.166 --> 01:45:07.709
The penitent man... The penitent...

01:45:08.085 --> 01:45:10.837
The penitent man is humble before God.

01:45:10.921 --> 01:45:12.672
Penitent. Penitent...

01:45:12.756 --> 01:45:14.507
The penitent man...

01:45:14.758 --> 01:45:17.385
Penitent man is humble,

01:45:17.845 --> 01:45:19.554
kneels before God.

01:45:19.638 --> 01:45:21.514
Kneel!

01:45:29.398 --> 01:45:30.690
I'm through!

01:45:32.943 --> 01:45:34.319
We're through.

01:45:36.447 --> 01:45:38.031
He's all right.

01:45:38.115 --> 01:45:39.449
No.

01:45:40.075 --> 01:45:42.827
The second challenge:
"The Word of God."

01:45:42.912 --> 01:45:46.664
"Only in the footsteps of God
will he proceed."

01:45:50.336 --> 01:45:52.712
The Word of God...

01:45:52.796 --> 01:45:54.088
The Word of...

01:45:57.176 --> 01:46:00.762
Proceed in the footsteps of the Word.

01:46:00.971 --> 01:46:04.140
- "The Word of God..."
- No, Henry. Try not to talk.

01:46:11.357 --> 01:46:17.320
The name of God...

01:46:18.989 --> 01:46:21.199
Jehovah.

01:46:21.742 --> 01:46:27.038
But in the Latin alphabet,
Jehovah begins with an "I."

01:46:27.748 --> 01:46:28.915
J...

01:46:35.089 --> 01:46:36.297
Oh, dear.

01:46:40.511 --> 01:46:42.428
Idiot!

01:46:42.513 --> 01:46:44.889
In Latin, Jehovah starts with an "I."

01:46:47.685 --> 01:46:49.185
"I."

01:46:49.895 --> 01:46:50.937
"E."

01:46:52.606 --> 01:46:53.648
"H."

01:46:54.233 --> 01:46:55.733
"O."

01:46:56.902 --> 01:46:58.403
"V."

01:46:58.487 --> 01:46:59.946
"A."

01:47:22.428 --> 01:47:24.053
"The Path of God."

01:47:27.850 --> 01:47:29.809
"Only in the leap from the lion's head

01:47:30.728 --> 01:47:33.062
"will he prove his worth."

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:39.902
Impossible, nobody can jump this.

01:47:42.781 --> 01:47:43.781
Indy!

01:47:44.408 --> 01:47:45.867
Indy, you must hurry!

01:47:46.076 --> 01:47:47.744
Come quickly!

01:47:53.667 --> 01:47:56.210
It's a leap of faith.

01:47:56.295 --> 01:47:57.587
Oh, geez...

01:47:57.921 --> 01:48:00.173
You must believe, boy.

01:48:00.257 --> 01:48:02.675
You must believe.

01:49:49.450 --> 01:49:51.951
I knew you'd come,

01:49:52.035 --> 01:49:54.287
but my strength has left me.

01:49:55.038 --> 01:49:56.205
Who are you?

01:49:56.707 --> 01:49:58.833
The last of three brothers

01:49:58.917 --> 01:50:02.003
who swore an oath to find the Grail

01:50:02.087 --> 01:50:03.963
and to guard it.

01:50:04.923 --> 01:50:06.549
That was 700 years ago.

01:50:06.884 --> 01:50:09.218
A long time to wait.

01:50:11.346 --> 01:50:14.849
You're strangely dressed, for a knight.

01:50:15.684 --> 01:50:17.477
I'm not exactly...

01:50:18.353 --> 01:50:19.979
A knight? What do you mean?

01:50:20.564 --> 01:50:22.273
I was chosen

01:50:22.357 --> 01:50:25.902
because I was the bravest,
the most worthy.

01:50:25.986 --> 01:50:29.322
The honor was mine until another came

01:50:29.406 --> 01:50:32.575
to challenge me to single combat.

01:50:33.744 --> 01:50:39.707
I pass it to you who vanquished me.

01:50:43.170 --> 01:50:45.588
Listen, I don't have time to explain, but...

01:51:02.606 --> 01:51:04.023
Which one is it?

01:51:04.441 --> 01:51:06.692
You must choose,

01:51:06.777 --> 01:51:08.903
but choose wisely.

01:51:08.987 --> 01:51:12.365
For as the true Grail will bring you life,

01:51:12.449 --> 01:51:13.491
the false Grail

01:51:13.909 --> 01:51:15.785
will take it from you.

01:51:21.792 --> 01:51:23.543
I'm not a historian.

01:51:23.627 --> 01:51:25.670
I have no idea what it looks like.

01:51:25.754 --> 01:51:28.130
Which one is it?

01:51:28.215 --> 01:51:29.840
Let me choose.

01:51:30.801 --> 01:51:32.760
Thank you, Doctor.

01:51:45.691 --> 01:51:47.650
Yes.

01:51:53.198 --> 01:51:56.659
It's more beautiful
than I'd ever imagined.

01:52:08.005 --> 01:52:11.340
This certainly is the cup of
the King of Kings.

01:52:17.806 --> 01:52:19.807
Eternal life.

01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:57.178
What is happening to me?

01:53:01.725 --> 01:53:03.601
Tell me, what is happening?

01:53:26.917 --> 01:53:29.085
He chose

01:53:29.169 --> 01:53:30.920
poorly.

01:53:40.681 --> 01:53:43.224
It would not be made out of gold.

01:53:43.308 --> 01:53:45.476
That's the cup of a carpenter.

01:53:55.612 --> 01:53:57.530
There's only one way to find out.

01:54:12.129 --> 01:54:15.881
You have chosen wisely.

01:54:16.967 --> 01:54:21.262
But the Grail cannot pass
beyond the Great Seal.

01:54:21.346 --> 01:54:26.475
That is the boundary
and the price of immortality.

01:55:52.979 --> 01:55:55.773
Drop your guns. Please.

01:55:59.110 --> 01:56:00.903
Dad, come on, get to your feet.

01:56:15.502 --> 01:56:17.461
We have got it. Come on!

01:56:18.922 --> 01:56:21.340
Elsa! Elsa, don't move!

01:56:21.842 --> 01:56:23.467
It's ours, Indy, yours and mine.

01:56:24.010 --> 01:56:26.053
Elsa, don't cross the Seal.

01:56:26.137 --> 01:56:29.098
The knight warned us
not to take the Grail from here.

01:56:55.709 --> 01:56:58.627
Junior!

01:57:01.047 --> 01:57:02.256
Elsa...

01:57:03.466 --> 01:57:05.342
Elsa, don't. Elsa...

01:57:05.719 --> 01:57:07.136
Elsa...

01:57:07.220 --> 01:57:09.555
Give me your other hand, honey.
I can't hold you!

01:57:09.639 --> 01:57:11.891
I can reach it. I can reach it.

01:57:11.975 --> 01:57:14.602
Elsa, give me your hand.
Give me your other hand!

01:57:17.314 --> 01:57:18.606
Elsa!

01:57:28.867 --> 01:57:30.492
Junior, give me your other hand!

01:57:30.577 --> 01:57:32.494
I can't hold on.

01:57:32.579 --> 01:57:33.787
I can get it.

01:57:33.872 --> 01:57:36.165
I can almost reach it, Dad.

01:57:36.708 --> 01:57:40.836
Indiana...

01:57:44.215 --> 01:57:46.425
Let it go.

01:58:05.695 --> 01:58:07.279
Dad...

01:58:13.870 --> 01:58:15.704
Please, Dad.

01:58:47.195 --> 01:58:50.030
Elsa never really believed in the Grail.

01:58:50.115 --> 01:58:52.992
She thought she'd found a prize.

01:58:59.249 --> 01:59:01.375
What did you find, Dad?

01:59:01.584 --> 01:59:03.085
Me?

01:59:05.714 --> 01:59:07.881
Illumination.

01:59:17.058 --> 01:59:18.267
And what did you find, Junior?

01:59:18.810 --> 01:59:20.811
"Junior"? Dad...

01:59:20.895 --> 01:59:23.397
Please, what does it always mean,
this... This "Junior"?

01:59:23.481 --> 01:59:26.358
That's his name: Henry Jones, Junior.

01:59:26.443 --> 01:59:28.277
I like Indiana.

01:59:28.361 --> 01:59:30.362
We named the dog Indiana.

01:59:30.447 --> 01:59:32.614
May we go home now, please?

01:59:32.699 --> 01:59:33.866
The dog?

01:59:34.743 --> 01:59:37.036
You are named after the dog?

01:59:39.497 --> 01:59:43.125
I've got a lot of fond memories
of that dog.

01:59:44.502 --> 01:59:47.046
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:59:47.130 --> 01:59:50.340
Indy! Henry! Follow me. I know the way!

01:59:56.139 --> 01:59:58.015
Got lost in his own museum, huh?

01:59:59.934 --> 02:00:02.394
After you, Junior.

02:00:02.479 --> 02:00:04.229
Yes, sir.
