What company are you with again?

13:53.375 --> 13:55.000
You look 19.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.420

14:17.816 --> 14:19.692
You failed!

14:19.693 --> 14:22.444
You asked me to break Multi-Paul
out of prison,

14:22.445 --> 14:25.281
and out of respect,
I hired a team to do it.

14:25.282 --> 14:27.700
But the job went sideways.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.160
Then try again.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.664
[clears throat] No.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.709
Or at least not now.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.919
There's too much heat.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.380
They've still got that
anti-teleport field up

14:41.381 --> 14:43.841
and my sources say
the prison just hired a superhero

14:43.842 --> 14:45.759
as their new guard dog.

14:45.760 --> 14:49.179
Find a way to get my assassin back.

You have 24 hours.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.666
What did I tell you?

15:17.667 --> 15:20.878
The expansion on the east side
was the right move.

15:20.879 --> 15:23.756
- Fiona!

Oh, sweet thing.
How was school today?

15:31.181 --> 15:32.556
Everything okay?

15:32.557 --> 15:36.226
School was great.
We had a math quiz and I got an A.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.479
And I sold all my cookies.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.231
That's my girl.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.859
A tiny old man with a metal mouth

how to set up my email,

16:03.421 --> 16:06.340

16:36.371 --> 16:38.122
why doesn't he go get him himself?

16:38.123 --> 16:41.875
Yeah, he wants Paul back,
but it's about more than that.

It's also him seeing

and do as you're told.

16:50.510 --> 16:54.596
Boss, uh...
there ain't no line with The Order.

16:54.597 --> 16:57.349
You think Multi-Paul
is their only assassin?

16:57.350 --> 17:01.270
Hell, last guy who went up against Liu
got eaten.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.648
Came out as fuckin' dragon shit.

17:04.649 --> 17:07.818
How'd an asshole like Machine Head
survive as long as he did?

17:07.819 --> 17:11.238
Believe it or not, he can shut up
when he has to.

17:11.239 --> 17:14.366
But he was always angling for Liu's seat.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.327
Wanted to run The Order himself.

more dangerous than that.

Could be whoever was spying on us.

without using your powers.

18:01.623 --> 18:04.124
Okay, okay, no flying.

37:46.515 --> 37:48.808
Eve...

37:48.809 --> 37:51.228
we got to charge more than we're charging.

37:53.730 --> 37:57.608
[Liu] You cannot kill what I am made from.

37:57.609 --> 37:58.734
[Mark sighs]

37:58.735 --> 38:01.153
Eve, I might need you here.

38:01.154 --> 38:02.322
[roaring]

38:06.326 --> 38:09.328
[Machine Head] Man,
Titan sure ruined this place.

38:09.329 --> 38:12.790
Well, him and that giant flying lizard
we all know and love.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.542
[grumbles]

38:14.543 --> 38:16.585
Whoa! Calm down, buddy.

38:16.586 --> 38:18.504
I'm not gonna fight you.
You must be what, like,

38:18.505 --> 38:20.798
700 pounds, eight? You'd murder me.

38:20.799 --> 38:24.218
Besides, that's not my style.

38:24.219 --> 38:26.762
But I am gonna kill your boss.

38:26.763 --> 38:28.181

[gasps] Mark!

38:46.575 --> 38:49.703
[Machine Head] See, you made
the same mistake I did.

38:54.082 --> 38:56.251
Oh, almost feels like cheating.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.380
- [roars]
- [grunts]

39:02.049 --> 39:04.175
[Machine Head] But I like cheating.

- [Eve] Huh?
- [Mark coughing]

39:16.354 --> 39:18.147
Machine Head
wanted the dragon to eat you

39:18.148 --> 39:20.066
before he killed Mr. Liu.

39:20.067 --> 39:22.485
But I figured I owed you one.

39:22.486 --> 39:26.072
[weakly] You... I'm taking you to jail.

39:26.073 --> 39:27.823
Nah.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.408
But thanks for the help, hero.

39:29.409 --> 39:32.119
Doing good, even if you didn't mean to.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.163
See you around.

39:36.625 --> 39:39.293
Are you okay?

39:39.294 --> 39:41.088
I don't know.

39:42.839 --> 39:44.548
What else could you have done?

39:44.549 --> 39:47.635
You couldn't let Titan
break Multi-Paul out of prison.

39:47.636 --> 39:49.678
Yeah. Instead,

39:49.679 --> 39:52.306
I just helped him kill his biggest rival.

39:52.307 --> 39:55.476
And almost died doing it. Again.

39:55.477 --> 39:57.978
It would have been worse
if we'd done nothing.

39:57.979 --> 39:59.814
That dragon could have killed everyone.

39:59.815 --> 40:02.024
Plus, Multi-Paul's still behind bars

40:02.025 --> 40:04.360
and the warden
thinks we did an acceptable job.

40:04.361 --> 40:08.239
After I helped
rebuild the damage to her prison.

40:08.240 --> 40:10.074
At least you accomplished something.

40:10.075 --> 40:14.036
Hey, we got paid enough
for at least three or four months' rent.

40:14.037 --> 40:16.997
About that. Maybe we should--

40:16.998 --> 40:18.917
Hold off on the apartment?

40:20.377 --> 40:23.420
With Oliver sneaking out,
it just doesn't feel right

40:23.421 --> 40:25.965
to leave my mom
to look after him by herself.

40:25.966 --> 40:27.967
He's my responsibility, too.

40:27.968 --> 40:31.762
You don't need to explain.
I get it.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.180
You're not upset?

40:33.181 --> 40:35.850
No, of course not.

40:35.851 --> 40:38.435
But as long as we're talking,

40:38.436 --> 40:41.480
I have been feeling like
things were moving...

40:41.481 --> 40:43.107
kinda fast.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.818
With my classes and us dating
and everything,

40:45.819 --> 40:48.154
it's been... it's been a lot of changes.

40:48.155 --> 40:50.281
And...

40:50.282 --> 40:52.825
I wouldn't mind slowing down.

40:52.826 --> 40:54.660
Hey, I get it, too.

40:54.661 --> 40:56.412
[gentle music playing]

40:56.413 --> 40:59.123
Now that we don't
need to pay rent anymore,

40:59.124 --> 41:01.500
should we still keep Invincible Inc.?

41:01.501 --> 41:05.297
Uh, those Séance Dog collectibles
aren't gonna pay for themselves.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.134
[Debbie clears throat]

41:10.135 --> 41:11.468
Hey, Mom.

41:11.469 --> 41:14.221
Did Oliver sneak out again?
I'll find him.

41:14.222 --> 41:16.015
No, he's in bed, reading.

41:16.016 --> 41:18.142
We had a good talk about it.

41:18.143 --> 41:19.810
You were right.

41:19.811 --> 41:22.313
Oliver deserves to be a kid.

41:22.314 --> 41:26.066
He's different, but he's, oh,
he's still just a kid.

41:26.067 --> 41:28.194
And kids should have friends,

41:28.195 --> 41:30.655
not parents who won't even
let them out to play.

41:31.740 --> 41:35.409
Eve and I are not getting
an apartment anymore.

41:35.410 --> 41:36.953
Oh, thank God.

41:39.497 --> 41:43.250
I mean, uh,
is everything okay between you two?

41:43.251 --> 41:44.710
If you need to talk...

41:44.711 --> 41:47.504
No, no. Eve and I are good.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.089
We just wanted to slow things down.

41:49.090 --> 41:50.966
I hope you're not doing this
because of me.

41:50.967 --> 41:52.927
I can handle myself.

41:52.928 --> 41:55.054
Oh, I know.

41:55.055 --> 41:57.556
I want to be an adult and protect the city

41:57.557 --> 41:59.141
and be a good boyfriend.

41:59.142 --> 42:02.853
And I also want to be here
with you and Oliver.

42:02.854 --> 42:05.272
It feels nice living with
a little brother, you know?

42:05.273 --> 42:08.442
[chuckles]
I don't want that to end just yet.

42:08.443 --> 42:12.029
Aw. It's my pancakes, isn't it?

42:12.030 --> 42:13.989
I mean, duh.

42:13.990 --> 42:17.577
- Oh, Mark. [chuckles softly]
- [sighs]

42:19.204 --> 42:21.789
Oh, the biggest thing
I've come to learn about adulthood

42:21.790 --> 42:24.833
is that nothing is ever black-and-white.

42:24.834 --> 42:27.419
So I'd say, in terms of growing up,

42:27.420 --> 42:29.547
you're doing just fine.

42:33.385 --> 42:36.679
By the way, just have to say it--
I know you and Eve are having sex.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.430
Mom! What?!

42:38.431 --> 42:41.392
It's a natural part of life.
And I want you to know--

42:41.393 --> 42:44.729
Okay! All done, Mom. Great talk.
Okay, good night.

42:48.066 --> 42:50.652
[ominous music playing]

43:01.579 --> 43:04.665
[Machine Head] Oh, it's so good
to be back, amigos.

43:04.666 --> 43:07.668
Did you miss me? Don't answer that.

43:07.669 --> 43:11.005
Because we all know
the answer is you missed me so much

43:11.006 --> 43:14.050
you didn’t do shit about it.

43:15.427 --> 43:18.429
Now, given that I took our poor old friend

43:18.430 --> 43:22.182
and previous leader Mr. Liu
behind the proverbial woodshed--

43:22.183 --> 43:25.602
and let's be honest,
shot him in the fucking head--

43:25.603 --> 43:28.564
that entitles me to his seat,
and therefore,

43:28.565 --> 43:31.734
the primo position in The Order.

43:31.735 --> 43:34.487
Any objections?

43:36.364 --> 43:38.741
That's what I like to hear.

43:38.742 --> 43:41.660
Now, does anyone have any new business

43:41.661 --> 43:44.872
he, she or it would like to bring up?

43:44.873 --> 43:45.956
Huh?

43:45.957 --> 43:47.042
Anyone.

43:49.002 --> 43:50.919
I know that seemed like
it was to the room,

43:50.920 --> 43:53.797
but I'm not fucking talking to you,

I keep the city,

43:58.636 --> 44:01.221
you all get everything else.

But I'm out.

[Machine Head] Eh...

44:08.146 --> 44:09.521
what the hell.

44:09.522 --> 44:12.232
You caught me
in a once in a lifetime good mood.

44:12.233 --> 44:14.860
Okay, take your toys and go home.

44:14.861 --> 44:18.864
We don’t want you
in our super special secret club anyway.

44:18.865 --> 44:21.701
Anyone else here got a problem with that?

44:25.246 --> 44:27.498
Aw, you guys did miss me.

44:27.499 --> 44:29.875
This is gonna be so great.

44:29.876 --> 44:31.460
[Titan] Thank you.

44:31.461 --> 44:35.047
[Machine Head] Hey, Titan,
before you go-- nice job.

44:35.048 --> 44:37.424
The way you played me and Liu--

44:37.425 --> 44:40.344
pure genius. Mwah!

44:40.345 --> 44:41.845
[Titan] Uh...

[Machine Head] I'm fucking with you.
