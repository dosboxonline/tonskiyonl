00:50.551 --> 00:53.667
Anything goes

02:48.585 --> 02:50.253
Anything goes.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.607
Be careful.

03:26.790 --> 03:29.667
You never told me you spoke
my language, Dr. Jones.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.670
Only on special occasions.

03:32.921 --> 03:35.089
So, it is true?

03:36.008 --> 03:37.800
You found Nurhachi?

03:38.010 --> 03:39.635
You know I did.

03:39.720 --> 03:43.055
Last night one of your boys
tried to get Nurhachi

03:43.140 --> 03:44.557
without paying for him.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.559
You have insulted my son.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.769
No, you have insulted me.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.188
I spared his life.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.983
Aren't you going to introduce us?

03:57.905 --> 03:59.322
This is Willie Scott.

03:59.781 --> 04:03.784
This is Indiana Jones,
famous archeologist.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.455
Well, I thought archeologists
were always funny little men

04:07.539 --> 04:09.665
searching for their mommies.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.000
Mummies.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.711
Dr. Jones found Nurhachi for me,

04:14.504 --> 04:17.798
and he's going to deliver him now.

04:18.966 --> 04:21.218
Say, who is this Nurhachi?

04:22.304 --> 04:23.846
Put the gun away, sonny.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.394
I suggest you give me what you owe me

04:30.479 --> 04:31.729
or anything goes.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.824
Open it.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.375
The diamond, Lao.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.211
The deal was for the diamond.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.902
Oh, Lao...

05:23.907 --> 05:25.366
To your very good health.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.410
Lao! He put a hole...

05:27.494 --> 05:30.830
He put two holes
in my dress from Paris!

05:30.914 --> 05:32.248
Sit down!

05:35.627 --> 05:39.922
Now, you bring me Nurhachi.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.008
My pleasure.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.510
Who on Earth is this Nurhachi?

05:49.099 --> 05:50.349
Here he is.

05:54.271 --> 05:57.273
This Nurhachi's a real small guy.

06:00.444 --> 06:03.320
Inside are the remains of Nurhachi,

06:04.406 --> 06:07.783
first Emperor of Manchu Dynasty.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.453
Welcome home, old boy.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.799
And now, you give me the diamond.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.761
Are you trying to develop
a sense of humor,

06:26.845 --> 06:28.721
or am I going deaf?

06:34.144 --> 06:35.436
What's that?

06:36.021 --> 06:37.396
Antidote.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.398
To what?

06:39.983 --> 06:43.235
The poison you just drank, Dr. Jones.

06:47.783 --> 06:50.659
The poison works fast, Dr. Jones.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.961
- Lao.
- Lao!

07:01.505 --> 07:04.131
You keep the girl. I find another.

07:08.220 --> 07:09.970
Good service here.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.764
That's not a waiter.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.850
Wu Han's an old friend.
Game's not over, Lao.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.144
Antidote.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.202
Indy...

07:37.040 --> 07:39.291
Don't worry, Wu Han,
I'll get you out of here.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.544
Not this time, Indy.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.964
I followed you on many adventures,

07:45.048 --> 07:49.218
but into the great unknown mystery,
I go first, Indy.

07:53.223 --> 07:56.016
Don't be sad, Dr. Jones.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.644
You will soon be joining him.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.944
Too much to drink, Dr. Jones?

08:58.788 --> 09:00.289
Oh, nuts!

09:10.467 --> 09:13.344
- The antidote.
- Where's the diamond?

09:42.415 --> 09:43.916
No!

09:48.004 --> 09:49.338
Stay there!

10:31.047 --> 10:32.381
Come on.

10:34.926 --> 10:36.385
I don't want to die!

10:47.897 --> 10:49.231
Who are you?

10:53.903 --> 10:55.863
Wow! Holy smoke!

10:55.947 --> 10:57.448
Crash landing!

10:57.866 --> 11:00.159
Short Round, step on it.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.329
Okeydokey, Dr. Jones.
Hold on to your potatoes.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.040
For crying out loud,
there's a kid driving the car!

11:21.431 --> 11:23.849
Wow! Wow.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.354
Where's the antidote? Let me have it.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.772
Listen, I just met you, for Christ's sakes.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.565
Give me...

11:31.649 --> 11:33.025
I'm not that kind of girl.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.319
Hey, Dr. Jones, no time for love.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.237
We got company.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.369
Oh, I hope you choke.

11:47.665 --> 11:48.874
No shooting.

12:03.723 --> 12:06.183
Okay, you asked for it.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.580
This is fun!

12:29.916 --> 12:31.500
Here, hold this.

12:37.048 --> 12:40.008
Where's my gun? Where's my gun?

12:40.176 --> 12:42.886
I burned my fingers,
and I cracked a nail!

12:52.897 --> 12:54.731
Dr. Jones... I'm Art Weber.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.442
I spoke with your assistant.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.527
We've managed to secure three seats,

12:58.611 --> 13:00.404
but there might be
a slight inconvenience

13:00.488 --> 13:04.116
as you will be riding
on a cargo full of live poultry.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.200
Is he kidding?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.661
Madam, it's the best I could do
on such short notice.

13:07.996 --> 13:12.332
Heavens, aren't you Willie Scott,
the famous American female vocalist?

13:14.210 --> 13:15.961
Owe you a gin.

13:24.262 --> 13:26.638
Nice try, Lao Che.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.271
Good-bye, Dr. Jones.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.311
So, what are you supposed to be,
a lion tamer?

14:14.395 --> 14:17.147
I'm allowing you to tag along,

14:17.273 --> 14:20.275
so why don't you give
your mouth a rest?

14:21.110 --> 14:22.653
Okay, doll?

14:22.737 --> 14:24.821
What do you mean, "tag along"?

14:24.906 --> 14:26.448
Ever since you got into my club,

14:26.533 --> 14:28.659
you haven't been able
to take your eyes off me.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.244
Oh, yeah?

16:06.049 --> 16:07.674
Oh, no.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.094
Oh, no! Mister, mister...

16:11.179 --> 16:12.846
Oh, mister, wake up. Please, mister...

16:12.930 --> 16:14.848
You call him Dr. Jones, doll!

16:14.932 --> 16:18.518
Okay, Dr. Jones, Dr. Jones.
Oh, wake up, please!

16:18.603 --> 16:20.479
Are we there already? Oh, good.

16:20.563 --> 16:21.730
No.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.569
- No one's flying the plane!
- Oh, boy...

16:28.946 --> 16:30.405
They've all gone!

16:34.202 --> 16:36.495
You know how to fly, don't you?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.246
No. Do you?

16:38.581 --> 16:39.706
Oh, no.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.208
- Oh, my God!
- How hard can it be?

16:41.292 --> 16:43.418
- I'm gonna faint.
- Altimeter! Okay.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.837
Air speed. Okay.

16:45.922 --> 16:46.922
Fuel...

16:48.091 --> 16:51.051
Fuel?

17:05.483 --> 17:07.150
I think we got a big problem.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.734
- Dr. Jones!
- Shorty!

17:08.819 --> 17:11.696
Dr. Jones! No more parachutes!

17:13.199 --> 17:14.449
Shorty!

17:14.534 --> 17:16.117
- Come on, give me a hand!
- What's that?

17:16.243 --> 17:17.536
Move the box!

17:17.619 --> 17:19.496
Dr. Jones, you're crazy!

17:23.917 --> 17:25.794
Shorty, get our stuff!

17:30.633 --> 17:33.427
A boat? We're not sinking.

17:33.511 --> 17:35.262
We're crashing!

17:35.972 --> 17:38.432
Grab on, Shorty! Grab on!

17:38.516 --> 17:40.684
- Lady, I can't breathe!
- Tight!

18:20.266 --> 18:21.725
Slow it down!

18:23.686 --> 18:25.812
That wasn't so bad, was it?

18:40.077 --> 18:41.995
Put on the brakes!

18:44.373 --> 18:48.710
I hate the water, and I hate being wet,

18:49.337 --> 18:50.921
and I hate you!

18:51.005 --> 18:53.048
Good. Good!

19:18.616 --> 19:19.950
Dr. Jones?

19:20.660 --> 19:22.536
I'm all right, Shorty.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.162
You okay?

19:33.256 --> 19:35.257
Where are we, anyway?

19:40.638 --> 19:41.805
India.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.390
How do you know that?

21:35.586 --> 21:37.629
I sure hope this means dinner.

21:37.713 --> 21:39.381
God, I'm starving.

21:40.216 --> 21:41.549
Thank you.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.308
I can't eat this.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.980
That's more food
than these people eat in a week.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.564
They're starving.

21:56.774 --> 21:58.483
Oh, I'm sorry. You can have...

21:58.567 --> 21:59.776
Eat it.

22:02.446 --> 22:03.989
I'm not hungry.

22:05.783 --> 22:09.119
You're insulting them,
and you're embarrassing me.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.247
- Eat it.
- Eat it.

22:12.873 --> 22:13.873
Eat.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.889
Bad news coming.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.644
Can you provide us with a guide
to take us to Delhi?

22:34.729 --> 22:37.564
I'm a professor.
I have to get back to my university.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.858
Yes. Sajnu will guide you.

22:42.903 --> 22:47.615
On the way to Delhi,
you will stop at Pankot.

22:49.285 --> 22:51.411
Pankot is not on the way to Delhi.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.747
You will go to Pankot Palace.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.624
I thought the palace had been deserted
since the 1850s.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.502
No. Now there is a new Maharajah,

23:00.254 --> 23:04.632
and again the palace
has the power of the Dark Light.

23:05.468 --> 23:08.428
It is that place kill my people.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.764
What has happened here?

23:10.848 --> 23:12.974
The evil start in Pankot,

23:13.809 --> 23:15.852
then like monsoon,

23:17.980 --> 23:20.482
it moves darkness

23:23.319 --> 23:25.487
over all country,

23:26.072 --> 23:27.989
over all country.

23:28.532 --> 23:29.824
The evil?

23:33.162 --> 23:34.412
What evil?

23:34.497 --> 23:36.164
See? Bad news.

23:36.791 --> 23:39.667
You listen to Suwamu. You leave Lanka.

23:42.046 --> 23:44.005
They came from palace

23:45.591 --> 23:50.136
and took Sivalinga from our village.

23:51.055 --> 23:52.388
Took what?

23:52.681 --> 23:54.265
It's a stone, a sacred stone

23:54.350 --> 23:56.184
from a shrine that protects the village.

23:56.268 --> 23:59.020
It is why Siva brought you here.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.740
We weren't brought here.

24:11.242 --> 24:13.118
Our plane crashed.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.078
It crashed.

24:15.538 --> 24:16.704
No, no.

24:17.540 --> 24:22.544
We prayed to Siva to help us
find the stone.

24:24.046 --> 24:28.842
It was Siva who made you fall
from the sky.

24:30.261 --> 24:35.723
So you will go to Pankot Palace
to find Sivalinga

24:36.392 --> 24:38.351
and bring back to us.

24:39.270 --> 24:45.233
Bring back to us.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.112
Dr. Jones, did they make
the plane crash

24:49.196 --> 24:50.822
to get you here?

24:51.490 --> 24:55.160
No, Shorty, it's just a ghost story.
Don't worry about it.

24:59.582 --> 25:01.791
They took the stone from here.

25:06.589 --> 25:10.675
Was the stone very smooth
like a rock from a sacred river?

25:10.759 --> 25:11.843
Yes.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.803
With three lines across it

25:13.888 --> 25:15.646
representing the three levels
of the universe.

25:15.731 --> 25:17.015
- That's right.
- Yes.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.809
I've seen stones like the one you lost.

25:20.352 --> 25:24.063
But why would Maharajah
take the sacred stone from here?

25:24.148 --> 25:27.734
They says we must pray
to their evil god.

25:28.861 --> 25:31.237
We says we will not.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.490
Excuse me, I don't understand
how one rock

25:34.575 --> 25:36.242
could destroy a whole village.

25:41.290 --> 25:42.999
He's saying when
the sacred stone was taken,

25:43.083 --> 25:45.627
the village wells dried up,
and the river turned to sand.

25:50.841 --> 25:52.342
The crops were swallowed by the earth,

25:52.468 --> 25:55.637
and the animals laid down
and turned to dust.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.307
Then one night
there was a fire in the fields.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.019
The men went out to fight the fire.

26:03.103 --> 26:06.231
When they came back,
the women were crying in the darkness.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.493
Children.

26:19.787 --> 26:22.205
He says they stole their children.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.840
Sankara! Sankara...

27:17.886 --> 27:22.140
Ranjit!

27:47.958 --> 27:49.292
Sankara.

28:05.267 --> 28:08.436
Little boy escaped from the evil palace.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.315
Many other children still there.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.442
What we do, Dr. Jones?

28:22.785 --> 28:24.285
What you think?

28:25.704 --> 28:29.999
I think that somebody believes
the good luck rock from this village

28:30.501 --> 28:32.543
is one of the lost Sankara Stones.

28:32.628 --> 28:34.253
What is Sankara?

28:35.798 --> 28:37.673
Fortune and glory, kid.

28:39.301 --> 28:40.968
Fortune and glory.

29:05.160 --> 29:08.204
Willie, quit monkeying around
on that thing.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.298
Oh, wait a second! Indy!

29:19.383 --> 29:21.634
I can't go to Delhi like this!

29:21.718 --> 29:25.680
We're not going to Delhi, doll.
We're going to Pankot Palace.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.348
Pankot?

29:27.433 --> 29:29.851
I can't go to Pankot! I'm a singer.

29:29.935 --> 29:32.562
Oh, I need to call my agent.
Is there a phone?

29:32.646 --> 29:34.313
Anybody, I need a phone!

30:25.157 --> 30:28.201
Oh, quit complaining.
This is expensive stuff.

30:29.912 --> 30:32.371
You come to America with me,
and we get job in circus.

30:32.456 --> 30:34.582
You like that? You like America?

30:34.666 --> 30:38.628
You're my best friend.

30:39.922 --> 30:41.964
What big birds!

30:42.758 --> 30:45.134
Those aren't big birds, sweetheart.

30:45.219 --> 30:47.762
They're giant vampire bats.

30:48.639 --> 30:49.764
Bats?

30:58.565 --> 31:01.484
Pipe down, you big baboon.
This doesn't hurt.

31:01.568 --> 31:04.987
You know what you really need?
You really need a bath.

31:14.414 --> 31:16.207
Ha-ha, very funny.

31:17.501 --> 31:21.128
Very funny.

31:21.547 --> 31:22.797
All wet.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.425
I was happy in Shanghai.

31:27.636 --> 31:30.805
I had a little house and a garden.

31:32.140 --> 31:33.182
My friends were rich.

31:33.267 --> 31:35.643
We went to parties
all the time in limousines.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.937
I hate being outside!

31:40.774 --> 31:43.693
I'm a singer! I could lose my voice!

31:46.530 --> 31:48.823
I think we'll camp here tonight.

31:50.701 --> 31:52.118
Cut it out.

31:58.208 --> 32:00.209
- What do you got?
- Two sixes.

32:00.294 --> 32:02.962
Aha-ha, three aces. I win.

32:03.046 --> 32:05.673
Two more game, I have all your money.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.553
It's poker, Shorty, anything can happen.

32:11.096 --> 32:13.556
Where did you find
your little bodyguard?

32:13.682 --> 32:16.017
I didn't find him, I caught him.

32:16.143 --> 32:17.226
What?

32:17.436 --> 32:20.563
Shorty's family were killed
when the Japanese bombed Shanghai.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.648
He's been living on the streets
since he was four.

32:22.733 --> 32:26.444
I caught him trying to pick my pocket,
didn't I, short stuff?

32:29.865 --> 32:32.158
Biggest trouble with her is the noise.

32:40.042 --> 32:43.127
Hey! You cheat, Dr. Jones. You cheat!

32:43.211 --> 32:44.754
- What do you mean?
- You take four card.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.633
- You pay now.
- Oh, they were stuck together.

32:48.717 --> 32:50.009
- No stuck. No mistake.
- They were stuck together.

32:50.093 --> 32:51.135
It's a mistake.

32:51.219 --> 32:53.262
I'm very little. You cheat very big.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.349
Dr. Jones, you cheat!

32:56.433 --> 32:58.267
You pay money. You owe me ten cent.

32:59.102 --> 33:00.978
Look at this. Look at this.

33:03.732 --> 33:06.567
You accuse me of cheating.
You're cheating.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.784
You make me poor. No fun.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.577
Play with you no fun.

33:16.745 --> 33:19.538
- I quit.
- I quit, too.

33:19.831 --> 33:21.749
This place is completely surrounded.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.043
The entire place is crawling
with living things.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.504
That's why they call it
the jungle, sweetheart.

33:26.588 --> 33:28.089
Oh, my God, what else is out there?

33:28.173 --> 33:29.799
Willie, wait...

33:34.930 --> 33:36.597
Willie, Willie...

33:36.765 --> 33:39.392
What is that?
Is that short for something?

33:39.935 --> 33:43.312
"Willie" is my professional name,
Indiana.

33:43.730 --> 33:46.524
Hey, lady, you call him Dr. Jones.

33:46.608 --> 33:48.442
My professional name.

33:50.404 --> 33:52.863
Why are you dragging us off
to this deserted palace?

33:52.948 --> 33:54.573
Fortune and glory?

33:54.658 --> 33:56.075
Fortune and glory.

33:57.119 --> 33:59.078
Well...

33:59.830 --> 34:01.789
this is a piece of an old manuscript.

34:03.125 --> 34:05.876
This pictograph represents Sankara,
a priest.

34:05.961 --> 34:07.128
Scram.

34:08.213 --> 34:11.005
Gentle. Gentle.
This is hundreds of years old.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.466
Is that some kind of writing?

34:12.551 --> 34:14.135
Yeah, it's Sanskrit.

34:14.219 --> 34:15.219
Cut it out.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.722
It's part of the legend of Sankara.

34:18.139 --> 34:20.181
He climbs Mount Kalisa
where he meets Siva,

34:20.266 --> 34:21.684
the Hindu god.

34:21.768 --> 34:24.812
That's Siva?
And what's he handing the priest?

34:25.438 --> 34:27.148
- Rocks.
- Stop.

34:28.190 --> 34:30.693
He told him to go forth and combat evil.

34:30.777 --> 34:33.154
And to help him,
he gave him five sacred stones

34:33.237 --> 34:34.989
with magical properties.

34:35.072 --> 34:36.574
Magic rocks?

34:36.658 --> 34:38.074
My grandpa was a magician.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.453
He spent his entire life
with a rabbit in his pocket

34:40.536 --> 34:41.536
and pigeons up his sleeves.

34:41.621 --> 34:44.956
He made a lot of children happy
and died a very poor man.

34:45.041 --> 34:48.085
Magic rocks. Fortune and glory.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.129
Sweet dreams, Dr. Jones.

34:50.839 --> 34:52.715
Where are you going?

34:52.799 --> 34:55.134
I'd sleep closer, if I were you.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.678
For safety's sake.

34:58.054 --> 35:01.182
Dr. Jones, I'd be safer
sleeping with a snake.

35:03.310 --> 35:05.770
I said, cut it out!

35:09.983 --> 35:11.776
I hate that elephant.

35:40.263 --> 35:41.639
Indy, look!

35:43.266 --> 35:46.393
I see it, Shorty. That's it. Pankot Palace.

37:05.265 --> 37:07.141
Dr. Jones, what you look at?

37:08.435 --> 37:10.144
Don't come up here.

37:15.817 --> 37:18.402
No! No, no, no, no! Don't leave! No!

37:18.486 --> 37:21.405
No, no, no, no, no!

37:21.489 --> 37:23.240
Oh, baby elephant, stay here!

37:23.325 --> 37:25.117
Oh, no! Indy!

37:25.493 --> 37:27.786
They're stealing our rides!

37:28.163 --> 37:29.830
We walk from here.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.785
Hello.

38:08.161 --> 38:10.579
I should say you look rather lost.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.832
But then I cannot imagine
where in the world

38:13.917 --> 38:15.918
the three of you would look at home.

38:16.044 --> 38:18.629
We're not lost.
We're on our way to Delhi.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.631
This is Miss Scott.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.508
This is Mr. Round.

38:22.759 --> 38:23.968
Short Round.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.886
My name is Indiana Jones.

38:26.554 --> 38:29.306
Dr. Jones, the eminent archeologist?

38:29.516 --> 38:31.558
Hard to believe, isn't it?

38:32.227 --> 38:35.980
I remember first hearing your name
when I was up at Oxford.

38:36.481 --> 38:39.149
I'm Chattar Lal,
Prime Minister to His Highness,

38:39.234 --> 38:41.110
the Maharajah of Pankot.

38:41.987 --> 38:43.070
I'm enchanted.

38:43.571 --> 38:46.323
Enchanted. Thank you very much.
Thank you very much.

38:46.408 --> 38:48.409
Welcome to Pankot Palace!

38:51.913 --> 38:53.247
Enchanted, huh?

39:05.010 --> 39:07.094
Shorty, where's my razor?

39:32.037 --> 39:36.373
We are fortunate tonight
to have so many unexpected visitors.

39:36.750 --> 39:38.500
- This is Captain...
- ...Blumburtt.

39:38.585 --> 39:40.044
11th Poona Rifles.

39:40.128 --> 39:43.005
And you, sir, are Dr. Jones, I presume.

39:43.465 --> 39:44.590
I am, Captain.

39:44.674 --> 39:48.719
Captain Blumburtt and his troops
are on a routine inspection tour.

39:48.803 --> 39:52.347
The British find it amusing
to inspect us at their convenience.

39:52.432 --> 39:56.852
I do hope, sir, that it's not
inconvenient to you, sir.

39:57.812 --> 40:00.564
The British worry so about their empire.

40:00.648 --> 40:03.650
Makes us all feel like
well-cared-for children.

40:13.995 --> 40:16.330
You look beautiful.

40:16.956 --> 40:19.208
I think the Maharajah
is swimming in loot.

40:19.292 --> 40:22.836
Maybe it wasn't such a bad idea
coming here after all.

40:23.213 --> 40:25.214
You look like a princess.

40:25.548 --> 40:29.009
Mr. Lal, what do they call
the Maharajah's wife?

40:29.594 --> 40:32.179
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.

40:32.263 --> 40:33.347
How interesting.

40:33.431 --> 40:36.433
Well, maybe it's because
he hasn't found the right woman.

40:50.323 --> 40:52.282
His Supreme Highness,

40:53.409 --> 40:55.911
guardian of Pankot tradition,

40:57.497 --> 40:59.706
the Maharajah of Pankot,

41:00.792 --> 41:02.876
Zalim Singh.

41:24.691 --> 41:26.441
That's the Maharajah?

41:27.026 --> 41:28.235
A kid?

41:30.864 --> 41:33.198
Maybe he like older women.

41:42.000 --> 41:43.625
Captain Blumburtt was just telling me

41:43.710 --> 41:46.170
something of the interesting
history of the palace,

41:46.254 --> 41:48.881
the importance it played in the mutiny.

41:48.965 --> 41:53.218
It seems the British never forget
the Mutiny of 1857.

41:54.596 --> 41:56.680
Yes, well, you know, I think
there are other events,

41:56.764 --> 41:58.974
before the mutiny, going back a century,

41:59.058 --> 42:01.852
back to the time of Clive,
that are more interesting.

42:02.103 --> 42:04.354
And what events are those, Dr. Jones?

42:04.439 --> 42:07.691
Well, if memory serves me correctly,
this area, this province,

42:07.775 --> 42:10.611
was the center of activity
for the Thuggee.

42:13.031 --> 42:15.574
Snake... Surprise.

42:16.242 --> 42:17.868
What's the surprise?

42:27.378 --> 42:30.380
Dr. Jones, you know perfectly well

42:30.465 --> 42:32.925
the Thuggee cult has been dead
for nearly a century.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.635
Yes, of course.

42:34.969 --> 42:37.137
The Thuggee was an obscenity

42:37.472 --> 42:40.307
that worshipped Kali
with human sacrifices.

42:41.226 --> 42:43.435
The British Army
nicely did away with them.

42:46.648 --> 42:49.983
Well, I suppose stories
of the Thuggee die hard.

42:50.068 --> 42:52.277
There are no stories anymore.

42:53.071 --> 42:54.655
I'm not so sure.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.407
We came from a small village.

42:57.492 --> 42:58.659
The peasants there told us

42:58.743 --> 43:01.078
Pankot Palace was growing
powerful again

43:01.162 --> 43:03.330
because of some ancient evil.

43:03.831 --> 43:05.582
Village stories, Dr. Jones.

43:05.667 --> 43:08.418
They're just fear and folklore.

43:10.296 --> 43:13.173
You're beginning to worry
Captain Blumburtt.

43:13.549 --> 43:19.429
I'm not worried, Mr. Prime Minister,
just interested.

43:34.946 --> 43:37.823
What? You are not eating?

43:39.742 --> 43:41.535
I had bugs for lunch.

43:45.707 --> 43:46.915
Give me your hat.

43:48.376 --> 43:49.710
Why?

43:49.794 --> 43:51.920
'Cause I'm gonna puke in it.

43:54.090 --> 43:58.218
You know, the villagers also told us
Pankot Palace had taken something.

43:58.553 --> 44:01.263
Dr. Jones, in our country,

44:01.347 --> 44:04.599
it's not usual for a guest
to insult his host.

44:05.643 --> 44:07.019
I'm sorry.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.938
I thought we were talking about folklore.

44:10.356 --> 44:14.067
Excuse me, sir,
do you have anything simple, like soup?

44:15.653 --> 44:18.947
What exactly was it
they say was stolen?

44:19.991 --> 44:21.491
A sacred rock.

44:24.495 --> 44:26.747
You see, Captain, a rock!

44:42.096 --> 44:45.932
Something connected the villagers' rock

44:46.434 --> 44:49.102
and the old legend
of the Sankara Stones.

44:49.187 --> 44:53.440
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable
to vicious rumors.

44:53.858 --> 44:56.109
I seem to remember that in Honduras

44:56.194 --> 44:58.236
you were accused of being
a grave robber

44:58.321 --> 45:00.030
rather than an archeologist.

45:00.114 --> 45:03.450
Well, the newspapers greatly
exaggerated the incident.

45:03.534 --> 45:06.787
And wasn't it the Sultan of Madagascar
who threatened to cut your head off

45:06.871 --> 45:08.205
if you ever returned to his country?

45:08.289 --> 45:09.331
No, it wasn't my head.

45:09.415 --> 45:10.707
Then your hands, perhaps.

45:10.792 --> 45:12.793
No, it wasn't my hands,

45:12.877 --> 45:13.960
it was my...

45:15.338 --> 45:16.630
My misunderstanding.

45:16.714 --> 45:19.007
Exactly what we have here, Dr. Jones.

45:19.092 --> 45:22.969
I have heard the evil stories
of the Thuggee cult.

45:23.221 --> 45:26.306
I thought the stories were told
to frighten children.

45:26.933 --> 45:30.060
Later, I learnt
the Thuggee cult was once real

45:30.144 --> 45:32.479
and did of unspeakable things.

45:32.980 --> 45:36.566
I am ashamed of what happened here
so many years ago,

45:36.651 --> 45:37.984
and I assure you

45:38.069 --> 45:42.155
this will never happen again
in my kingdom.

45:42.990 --> 45:44.908
If I offended you,

45:46.160 --> 45:47.619
then I am sorry.

45:58.631 --> 46:00.507
Dessert!

46:13.187 --> 46:15.522
Chilled monkey brains.

46:30.955 --> 46:32.956
I think I'll just check on Willie.

46:34.500 --> 46:36.460
That's all you better do.

46:38.588 --> 46:40.714
Tell me later what happened.

46:40.798 --> 46:42.466
Am-scray.

46:53.394 --> 46:55.061
I've got something for you.

46:55.563 --> 46:59.399
There's nothing you have
that I could possibly want.

46:59.484 --> 47:00.942
Right.

47:13.873 --> 47:15.790
You're a very nice man.

47:15.875 --> 47:18.543
Maybe you could be my palace slave.

47:28.429 --> 47:30.847
Wear your jewels to bed, Princess?

47:31.599 --> 47:32.974
Yeah.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.102
And nothing else.

47:36.938 --> 47:38.104
That shock you?

47:38.189 --> 47:39.856
Nothing shocks me.

47:40.608 --> 47:42.526
I'm a scientist.

47:43.694 --> 47:46.404
So, as a scientist,
you do a lot of research?

47:47.532 --> 47:48.865
Always.

47:49.158 --> 47:51.451
And what sort of research
would you do on me?

47:55.081 --> 47:56.456
Nocturnal activities.

47:56.541 --> 47:59.584
You mean like what sort of cream
I put on my face at night,

47:59.669 --> 48:01.336
what position I like to sleep in?

48:01.546 --> 48:02.879
Mating customs.

48:02.964 --> 48:04.005
Love rituals?

48:04.298 --> 48:07.008
Primitive sexual practices.

48:07.093 --> 48:08.802
So you're an authority in that area?

48:09.136 --> 48:10.554
Years of fieldwork.

48:20.189 --> 48:22.649
I don't blame you for being sore at me.

48:22.984 --> 48:25.402
I can be hard to handle.

48:26.320 --> 48:28.113
I've had worse.

48:28.739 --> 48:30.949
But you'll never have better.

48:33.911 --> 48:35.620
I don't know.

48:35.705 --> 48:37.956
As a scientist,
I don't want to prejudice my experiment.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.708
I'll let you know in the morning.

48:40.793 --> 48:43.378
Why, you conceited ape.

48:43.462 --> 48:45.714
I'm not that easy.

48:47.383 --> 48:49.426
I'm not that easy, either.

48:50.011 --> 48:51.553
Trouble with you is, Willie,

48:51.637 --> 48:53.847
you're too used to getting your own way.

48:54.682 --> 48:55.942
And you're just too proud to admit

48:56.017 --> 48:59.185
that you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones.

48:59.687 --> 49:02.731
If you want me, Willie,
you know where you can find me.

49:03.316 --> 49:04.774
Five minutes.

49:04.859 --> 49:06.860
You'll be back over here in five minutes.

49:06.944 --> 49:08.486
I'll be asleep in five minutes.

49:08.571 --> 49:09.779
Five.

49:09.864 --> 49:12.198
You know it, and I know it.

49:26.881 --> 49:28.882
Five minutes.

49:31.052 --> 49:33.053
Four and a half.

50:26.857 --> 50:29.109
"Palace slave."

50:29.485 --> 50:31.736
"Nocturnal activities."

50:33.406 --> 50:35.281
I'm a "conceited ape"?

50:36.033 --> 50:37.367
"I'll tell you in the morning."

50:39.328 --> 50:40.995
I can't believe it.

50:41.372 --> 50:42.622
He's not coming.

50:43.082 --> 50:44.708
She's not coming.

50:47.044 --> 50:48.503
I can't believe I'm not going.

51:08.774 --> 51:10.316
Indiana Jones!

51:10.401 --> 51:13.069
This is one night you'll never forget!

51:13.154 --> 51:16.239
This is the night
I slipped right through your fingers!

51:18.367 --> 51:19.617
Sleep tight,

51:19.702 --> 51:21.369
and pleasant dreams!

51:24.331 --> 51:26.958
I could have been
your greatest adventure.

51:37.553 --> 51:38.678
Dr. Jones, your whip!

52:00.201 --> 52:01.284
Shorty,

52:01.368 --> 52:02.494
turn off the switch.

52:09.001 --> 52:10.251
Indy.

52:11.504 --> 52:14.339
Be gentle with me.

52:20.179 --> 52:22.138
But I'm here.

52:33.859 --> 52:34.901
There's nobody here.

52:35.236 --> 52:37.237
No, I'm here.

52:38.239 --> 52:41.032
Indy, you're acting awfully strange.

53:06.934 --> 53:09.894
Hey, I'm right here.

53:21.991 --> 53:26.244
"Follow in the footsteps of Siva."

53:26.453 --> 53:28.246
What does that mean?

53:31.375 --> 53:34.627
"Do not betray these truths."

53:34.712 --> 53:37.297
Shorty, go get our stuff.

54:06.327 --> 54:08.494
Stay behind me, Short Round.

54:09.455 --> 54:13.082
Step where I step,
and don't touch anything.

54:25.596 --> 54:27.055
I step where you step.

54:27.139 --> 54:29.098
I touch nothing.

54:30.351 --> 54:32.352
Indy!

54:52.998 --> 54:54.749
I step on something.

54:55.960 --> 54:58.211
Yeah, there's something on the ground.

54:58.295 --> 55:00.630
Feel like step on fortune cookies.

55:01.840 --> 55:04.425
It's not fortune cookies.

55:06.095 --> 55:08.221
Let me take a look.

55:21.610 --> 55:23.277
That's no cookies.

55:23.946 --> 55:25.738
It's all right. I got him.

55:29.076 --> 55:31.035
Go. There, go.

56:10.993 --> 56:12.076
Stop.

56:12.161 --> 56:15.413
Look, just stand up against the wall,
will you?

56:30.387 --> 56:32.555
You say to stand against the wall!

56:32.639 --> 56:33.973
I listen to what you say!

56:34.058 --> 56:36.142
- Not my fault! Not my fault!
- Willie, get down here!

56:36.226 --> 56:38.102
We're in trouble!

56:38.353 --> 56:41.064
Willie! Willie!

56:41.148 --> 56:43.733
Bet I get all dirty again.

56:44.193 --> 56:45.735
- Willie, get down here!
- Not my fault!

56:45.819 --> 56:46.903
We're in trouble!

56:47.404 --> 56:50.281
Trouble? Trouble? What sort of...

57:05.714 --> 57:07.340
This is serious!

57:07.508 --> 57:10.802
There are two dead people down here!

57:11.053 --> 57:14.138
There're going to be
two dead people in here! Hurry!

57:14.348 --> 57:16.390
I've almost had enough of you two.

57:16.683 --> 57:17.725
Willie!

57:17.851 --> 57:19.519
What's the rush?

57:19.728 --> 57:22.814
It's a long story, Willie.
Hurry, or you don't get to hear it.

57:24.900 --> 57:27.610
God, what is this?

57:29.530 --> 57:31.155
Indy, what is this?

57:31.240 --> 57:33.533
I can't see a thing!

57:34.368 --> 57:35.451
Hurry!

57:35.536 --> 57:37.161
All right!

57:37.538 --> 57:38.663
I broke a nail.

57:53.262 --> 57:54.804
Willie, hurry!

57:54.888 --> 57:56.889
They're in my hair!

57:56.974 --> 57:58.724
Shut up, Willie!

58:00.018 --> 58:02.520
- Indy, let me in!
- No, let us out!

58:02.604 --> 58:04.647
- Let me in!
- Let us out!

58:04.731 --> 58:06.440
- Shut up!
- I'm down here!

58:06.525 --> 58:07.900
They're all over me!

58:08.652 --> 58:11.320
There's got to be
a fulcrum release lever somewhere.

58:11.405 --> 58:12.405
What?

58:12.573 --> 58:14.407
A handle that opens the door.

58:14.616 --> 58:16.325
- Go on!
- They're just, just square holes!

58:16.410 --> 58:17.994
Go to the right hole.

58:19.246 --> 58:20.705
Hurry, Willie!

58:27.588 --> 58:30.590
The other one! The other right.
Your other right!

58:30.674 --> 58:33.092
- The one on your right!
- There's slime inside!

58:33.677 --> 58:35.052
I can't do it.

58:35.387 --> 58:37.180
You can do it. Feel inside.

58:37.472 --> 58:38.598
Okay.

58:42.102 --> 58:43.269
You feel inside!

58:43.937 --> 58:45.229
Do it now!

58:45.314 --> 58:46.689
Okay!

58:55.866 --> 59:00.453
Willie, we are going to die!

59:01.788 --> 59:03.206
It's soft.

59:06.126 --> 59:07.376
It's moving!

59:15.552 --> 59:16.594
Got it!

59:31.318 --> 59:33.236
Get 'em off of me! Get 'em off of me!

59:33.445 --> 59:36.155
They're all over me! Get 'em off me!

59:38.825 --> 59:40.117
No!

59:42.246 --> 59:44.080
It wasn't me! It's her!

59:46.083 --> 59:47.250
Come on!

59:47.334 --> 59:50.544
Go! Move! Come on, move! Come on!

01:00:51.398 --> 01:00:53.482
It's a Thuggee ceremony.

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.067
They're worshipping Kali.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:07.288
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

01:01:07.372 --> 01:01:09.582
Nobody's seen this for a hundred years.

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:49.390
Kali Ma. Kali Ma...

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:51.517
Kali Ma!

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.014
He's still alive.

01:04:54.808 --> 01:04:56.600
Kali Ma.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:01.123
That's the rock
they took from the village.

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:03.709
It's one of the Sankara Stones.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.926
Why they glow like that?

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:16.513
The legend says

01:06:16.598 --> 01:06:17.848
when the rocks are brought together,

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:20.309
the diamonds inside them will glow.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:22.019
Diamonds?

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:23.187
Diamonds.

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:24.480
Diamonds!

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:25.606
Diamonds.

01:06:42.707 --> 01:06:43.999
Hey, hey.

01:06:44.084 --> 01:06:47.836
Look, I want you two
to stay up here and keep quiet.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:49.254
Shorty, you keep an eye on her.

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:51.048
- Why, where are you going?
- Down there.

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:54.176
Down there? Are you crazy?

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:57.388
I'm not leaving here without the stones.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:00.683
You could get killed chasing after
your damn fortune and glory!

01:07:00.767 --> 01:07:01.767
Maybe.

01:07:03.353 --> 01:07:05.270
But not today.

01:08:20.471 --> 01:08:22.305
Be careful.

01:09:32.085 --> 01:09:33.919
Where's he going?

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:38.381
Let me go!

01:09:41.426 --> 01:09:43.804
Run, Willie! Run!

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:19.274
Dr. Jones!

01:11:21.569 --> 01:11:22.945
I keep telling you,

01:11:23.029 --> 01:11:26.073
you listen me more, you live longer.

01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:28.533
Please, let me die.

01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:31.495
I pray to Siva,

01:11:32.163 --> 01:11:35.332
"Let me die," but I do not.

01:11:35.875 --> 01:11:38.752
Now... Now the evil of Kali take me.

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:41.588
How?

01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:44.466
They will make me drink
the blood of the Kali.

01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:47.886
Then I'll fall into
the Black Sleep of the Kali Ma.

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:49.346
What is that?

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:51.765
We become like them.

01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:58.105
We'll be alive, but like a nightmare.

01:11:58.189 --> 01:12:01.692
You drink blood,
you not wake up from nightmare.

01:12:13.538 --> 01:12:17.416
You were caught trying to steal
the Sankara Stones.

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:20.585
There were five stones in the beginning.

01:12:21.421 --> 01:12:24.339
Over the centuries,
they were dispersed by wars,

01:12:24.424 --> 01:12:26.550
sold off by thieves like you.

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:28.510
Thieves like me, huh?

01:12:29.929 --> 01:12:32.305
Still missing two.

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:35.267
A century ago,
when the British raided this temple

01:12:35.351 --> 01:12:37.227
and butchered my people,

01:12:37.311 --> 01:12:41.690
a loyal priest hid the last two stones
down here in the catacombs.

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:44.943
So that's what you've got
these slaves digging for, huh?

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:46.862
They're innocent children.

01:12:46.946 --> 01:12:49.698
They dig for the gems
to support our cause.

01:12:51.159 --> 01:12:53.827
They also search
for the last two stones.

01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:59.875
Soon we will have
all the five Sankara Stones,

01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:02.836
and the Thuggees will be all powerful.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:06.089
What a vivid imagination.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:14.222
You don't believe me?

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.101
You will, Dr. Jones.

01:13:20.146 --> 01:13:24.691
You will become a true believer.

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:43.376
Hi.

01:14:07.860 --> 01:14:09.111
Dr. Jones!

01:14:09.195 --> 01:14:10.654
Don't drink, it's bad!

01:14:10.738 --> 01:14:12.739
Don't drink!

01:14:12.824 --> 01:14:14.241
Spit it out!

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:49.985
Dr. Jones...

01:15:07.753 --> 01:15:11.381
You dare not do that.

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:31.610
Leave him alone, you bastards!

01:15:42.330 --> 01:15:44.539
The British in India will be slaughtered.

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:46.875
Then we will overrun the Muslims.

01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:49.711
Then the Hebrew God will fall.

01:15:50.504 --> 01:15:53.465
And then the Christian God
will be cast down and forgotten.

01:15:55.968 --> 01:15:59.054
Soon, Kali Ma will rule the world.

01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:07.479
Dr. Jones...

01:17:50.875 --> 01:17:53.752
Kali Ma protects us.

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:56.004
We are her children.

01:17:57.214 --> 01:17:59.341
We pledge our devotion to her

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.343
with an offering of flesh...

01:18:01.427 --> 01:18:03.219
What are you doing?

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:08.266
...and blood.

01:18:17.276 --> 01:18:21.613
Your friend has seen,
and she has heard.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.617
Now she will not talk.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:36.753
I'm not going to have
anything nice to say

01:18:36.837 --> 01:18:38.713
about this place when I get back.

01:18:39.006 --> 01:18:42.384
Indy! For God sakes, help me!

01:18:42.468 --> 01:18:44.761
What's the matter with you?

01:18:59.819 --> 01:19:02.529
No, no.

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:39.149
Come.

01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:03.548
Indiana...

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:08.553
Indiana, help us.

01:20:22.193 --> 01:20:24.486
Please, snap out of it.

01:20:25.738 --> 01:20:32.494
You're not one of them.

01:20:35.539 --> 01:20:37.624
Please come back to us.

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:40.418
Don't leave me.

01:20:53.432 --> 01:20:56.142
No!

01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:00.939
What are you doing?

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:02.732
Are you mad?

01:22:19.393 --> 01:22:22.020
This can't be happening,
this can't be happening.

01:22:22.646 --> 01:22:25.732
Wake up, Willie, wake up.

01:22:56.847 --> 01:22:59.724
No! No! No!

01:23:11.737 --> 01:23:13.655
No, no, no!

01:23:14.365 --> 01:23:16.699
Wake up, Dr. Jones, wake up!

01:23:20.913 --> 01:23:22.705
Dr. Jones!

01:23:38.263 --> 01:23:39.764
Indy, I love you.

01:23:41.183 --> 01:23:43.935
Wake up, Indy! Wake up!

01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:49.065
You're my best friend! Wake up, Indy!

01:23:54.321 --> 01:23:56.322
Wait! Wait!

01:23:57.116 --> 01:23:58.741
He's mine!

01:24:02.204 --> 01:24:04.497
I'm all right, kid.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:50.209
Mola Ram!

01:26:12.251 --> 01:26:14.168
Give me some slack!

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:35.982
Willie, Willie, wake up!

01:26:37.985 --> 01:26:40.528
Willie, Willie, it's me! I'm back!

01:26:43.240 --> 01:26:45.032
Indy.

01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:15.104
Indy, my friend.

01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:18.149
I'm sorry, kid.

01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:27.783
Indy, now, let's get out of here.

01:27:30.579 --> 01:27:32.997
Right. All of us.

01:28:46.530 --> 01:28:48.114
No!

01:29:04.631 --> 01:29:05.756
I've got to save him!

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:08.092
- He can take care of himself.
- He needs me.

01:29:10.804 --> 01:29:12.013
I've got to save Indy!

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:26.777
Okay, save him.

01:29:30.449 --> 01:29:31.866
Drop him down!

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:34.160
I kill you! Drop him down!

01:30:05.442 --> 01:30:06.984
What's the matter with him?

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:52.363
Here. Try this.

01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:09.106
Go, Indy!

01:33:11.294 --> 01:33:13.629
It was the Black Sleep of Kali.

01:33:26.851 --> 01:33:28.060
Short Round!

01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:32.356
Quit fooling around with that kid!
Get down in the cart, now!

01:33:32.732 --> 01:33:33.941
Okeydokey, Indy!

01:33:34.484 --> 01:33:37.361
Please listen.
To get out, you must take the left tunnel.

01:33:37.696 --> 01:33:39.071
Thank you.

01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:28.329
Shorty! Quit stalling!

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:30.581
Come on, Indy!

01:34:30.832 --> 01:34:31.915
Go!

01:34:32.250 --> 01:34:33.375
Go! Go!

01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:38.756
Shorty, look out!

01:34:46.306 --> 01:34:47.598
- Come on!
- Indy!

01:34:53.813 --> 01:34:54.813
Hurry!

01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:02.029
Hurry! Hurry up!

01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:11.038
Indy, take the left tunnel! The left tunnel!

01:35:11.122 --> 01:35:13.874
No, Indy! You missed it! Left tunnel!

01:35:44.823 --> 01:35:46.573
We got company!

01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:52.621
- Stop.
- Let her go!

01:35:52.705 --> 01:35:54.498
- Let go of the brake.
- What?

01:35:54.874 --> 01:35:56.375
- What?
- Let her go.

01:35:56.459 --> 01:35:57.876
Our only chance is to outrun them.

01:36:14.936 --> 01:36:16.061
Shorty?

01:36:16.146 --> 01:36:18.147
Come up here and take the brake.

01:36:19.190 --> 01:36:21.859
Watch it on the curves,
or we'll fly right off the track.

01:36:21.943 --> 01:36:23.193
Okay.

01:37:44.609 --> 01:37:46.693
- What are you doing?
- Short cut.

01:37:46.778 --> 01:37:48.320
- Yes, Indy.
- Short, cut.

01:38:12.637 --> 01:38:14.304
Watch it!

01:38:18.268 --> 01:38:19.768
Indy, help!

01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:24.189
- Hang on!
- Indy!

01:38:25.024 --> 01:38:27.484
- Pull him in.
- Let me go! Let me go!

01:38:28.861 --> 01:38:30.571
Let go of him!

01:38:31.573 --> 01:38:33.949
No! No!

01:38:34.033 --> 01:38:35.075
Pull him in!

01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:36.243
- I'll catch him!
- No!

01:39:22.915 --> 01:39:23.915
Duck!

01:39:43.853 --> 01:39:44.936
- All right.
- What?

01:39:45.021 --> 01:39:46.605
Brakes. Brakes.

01:39:46.689 --> 01:39:48.649
- Slow us down.
- Okay.

01:39:53.905 --> 01:39:56.406
Big mistake. Big mistake, Indy.

01:39:56.491 --> 01:39:57.574
Figures.

01:40:18.846 --> 01:40:20.347
We're going too fast!

01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:21.515
Too fast!

01:40:21.891 --> 01:40:23.183
We're going to crash!

01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:37.406
Water, water, water!

01:40:37.490 --> 01:40:38.949
- Look! Look there!
- Water!

01:40:39.117 --> 01:40:41.368
- Fire! You're on fire!
- Water, water!

01:40:41.452 --> 01:40:44.371
- Look...
- Water, water.

01:40:45.540 --> 01:40:47.332
Water, water.

01:40:48.042 --> 01:40:50.127
Come on. Come on!

01:41:03.766 --> 01:41:05.225
Let's go!

01:41:09.439 --> 01:41:11.064
Run, run!

01:41:23.828 --> 01:41:25.203
Willie, look out!

01:41:35.339 --> 01:41:36.465
No!

01:41:36.549 --> 01:41:39.301
Head for the bridge. Go!

01:41:40.595 --> 01:41:42.012
Come on, Willie, this way.

01:41:55.401 --> 01:41:56.735
Oh, God.

01:41:56.819 --> 01:42:01.740
Come on, let's go. Strong bridge.

01:42:02.033 --> 01:42:03.867
Look, strong wood.

01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:06.036
Come on!

01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:07.412
Look!

01:42:07.663 --> 01:42:09.372
Shorty!

01:42:11.834 --> 01:42:13.835
Help! I'm falling down.

01:42:16.506 --> 01:42:18.048
Help!

01:42:19.926 --> 01:42:21.051
Not very funny.

01:42:46.410 --> 01:42:47.744
Back!

01:43:13.437 --> 01:43:15.272
Welcome.

01:43:27.785 --> 01:43:29.911
Let her go, Mola Ram.

01:43:29.996 --> 01:43:33.957
You are in a position
unsuitable to give orders.

01:43:34.458 --> 01:43:35.667
Watch your back!

01:43:45.011 --> 01:43:46.595
You want the stones, let 'em go.

01:43:51.225 --> 01:43:52.601
Let her go!

01:43:54.145 --> 01:43:56.730
Drop them, Dr. Jones.

01:43:56.814 --> 01:43:59.190
They will be found.

01:43:59.275 --> 01:44:01.067
You won't.

01:44:04.155 --> 01:44:05.238
Indy!

01:44:05.323 --> 01:44:06.907
Behind you!

01:44:15.541 --> 01:44:17.667
Oh, shit.

01:44:28.262 --> 01:44:29.930
Go on.

01:44:31.015 --> 01:44:32.515
Go.

01:44:41.651 --> 01:44:43.360
Go on! Go on!

01:44:44.445 --> 01:44:46.321
Get moving.

01:44:50.076 --> 01:44:52.035
Shorty...

01:44:57.583 --> 01:45:00.168
Hang on, lady. We going for a ride.

01:45:01.963 --> 01:45:03.797
Oh, my God!

01:45:05.633 --> 01:45:09.094
Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:45:09.553 --> 01:45:11.179
Is he nuts?

01:45:12.056 --> 01:45:13.515
He no nuts.

01:45:13.599 --> 01:45:15.183
He's crazy.

01:45:15.518 --> 01:45:20.271
Mola Ram, prepare to meet Kali

01:45:20.356 --> 01:45:22.107
in hell.

01:45:23.192 --> 01:45:24.317
What are you doing?

01:45:24.860 --> 01:45:26.236
You fool!

01:46:26.464 --> 01:46:28.173
Indy, cover your heart!

01:46:28.257 --> 01:46:30.216
Cover your heart!

01:46:30.843 --> 01:46:32.552
Oh, my God!

01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.813
Oh, my God.

01:47:26.857 --> 01:47:28.191
- Look out!
- No!

01:47:53.717 --> 01:47:55.218
No!

01:47:59.682 --> 01:48:01.391
Come on. Let's go!

01:48:02.309 --> 01:48:04.310
The stones are mine!

01:48:05.396 --> 01:48:07.355
You've betrayed Siva.

01:48:11.610 --> 01:48:13.194
You betrayed Siva.

01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:23.997
You betrayed Siva!

01:48:56.113 --> 01:48:58.114
Well, it's about time.

01:49:16.300 --> 01:49:17.800
Hold your fire.

01:51:20.382 --> 01:51:22.592
We know you are coming back

01:51:22.926 --> 01:51:25.762
when life return to our village.

01:51:29.767 --> 01:51:36.272
Now you can see the magic
of the rock you bring back.

01:51:36.565 --> 01:51:40.360
Yes, I understand its power now.

01:51:46.116 --> 01:51:47.617
You could've kept it.

01:51:47.701 --> 01:51:49.619
What for?
They'd just put it in a museum.

01:51:49.703 --> 01:51:52.121
It'd be another rock collecting dust.

01:51:52.206 --> 01:51:55.750
But then it would've given you
your fortune and glory.

01:51:55.834 --> 01:51:57.585
Anything could happen.

01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:59.879
It's a long way to Delhi.

01:51:59.963 --> 01:52:01.047
No, thanks.

01:52:01.131 --> 01:52:03.383
No more adventures with you,
Dr. Jones.

01:52:03.467 --> 01:52:07.053
Sweetheart, after all the fun
we've had together?

01:52:08.180 --> 01:52:11.224
If you think I'm going to Delhi with you,
or anyplace else

01:52:11.308 --> 01:52:13.309
after all the trouble
you've gotten me into,

01:52:13.394 --> 01:52:15.103
think again, buster!

01:52:15.187 --> 01:52:17.605
I'm going home to Missouri
where they never feed you snakes,

01:52:17.689 --> 01:52:20.400
before ripping your heart out
and lowering you into hot pits!

01:52:20.484 --> 01:52:23.986
This is not my idea of a swell time!

01:52:24.071 --> 01:52:26.948
Excuse me, sir. I need a guide to Delhi.
If you could...

01:52:46.844 --> 01:52:54.844
Very funny.
