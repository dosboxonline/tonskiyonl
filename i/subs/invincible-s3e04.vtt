WEBVTT

00:04.003 --> 00:05.506
[Allen] I'm not leaving here without you.

00:05.589 --> 00:06.465
[Nolan] And I'm never leaving.

00:06.549 --> 00:07.508
[Allen] Can we just talk about this

00:07.591 --> 00:09.677
before we, uh...?
Well, that sucked.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.471
-[Nolan] You're alive?
-[Allen] This is progress.

00:12.555 --> 00:13.514
You care about me.

00:13.597 --> 00:14.682
I feel like you're halfway
to joining the cause.

00:14.765 --> 00:16.976
[Battle Beast] I was promised, this world

00:17.059 --> 00:18.728
offered worthy opponents.

00:18.811 --> 00:19.812
[Donald] Somebody appears to be

00:19.895 --> 00:21.814
stealing the Declaration of Independence.

00:21.897 --> 00:24.900
[Rex] I'd rather quit
than work with a sanctimonious

00:24.984 --> 00:27.027
prick like you.

00:27.111 --> 00:29.113
It's not buried under a mountain,

00:29.196 --> 00:30.948
but it's ours.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.992
Nolan wasn't a travel writer.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.201
[Debbie moans]

00:34.285 --> 00:37.079
Kid Omni-Man is here.

00:37.163 --> 00:38.873
Oh, geez.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.916
-[Mark] What's this?
-[Art] A fresh start.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.877
-[Oliver] I beat the bad guys.
-[Mark] You killed them!

00:42.960 --> 00:45.171
I can't believe I'm late
to our first date.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.881
Got you.

00:50.134 --> 00:52.678
[Rex groans]

00:52.762 --> 00:54.764
You wanted to come, Rex.

00:54.847 --> 00:59.518
Yeah, but I'd forgotten
how boring this is.

00:59.602 --> 01:02.146
Come on, let's go get a drink.

01:02.229 --> 01:03.606
We need groceries.

01:03.689 --> 01:05.733
No one's gonna cook for us anymore.

01:05.816 --> 01:08.569
What did you guys do before?
Back on Teen Team?

01:08.652 --> 01:11.572
[clears throat] Hmm... Well...

01:11.655 --> 01:13.324
Eve still lived at home,

01:13.407 --> 01:15.659
Kate kept to herself. Mm...

01:15.743 --> 01:17.870
I stole Robot's credit card number

01:17.953 --> 01:19.830
and I lived off delivery pizza,

01:19.914 --> 01:22.291
ramen noodles, and black coffee.

01:22.374 --> 01:25.127
[laughs] I almost got scurvy once.

01:25.211 --> 01:26.420
[munching]

01:26.504 --> 01:29.381
I wouldn't be quite so proud of that.

01:29.465 --> 01:31.509
Eh, rock and roll star,

01:31.592 --> 01:33.594
rock and roll lifestyle, you know.

01:33.676 --> 01:36.430
[chuckles] Oh, what about you?

01:36.514 --> 01:38.682
Oh, my parents had me
on an engineered diet

01:38.765 --> 01:41.268
since before I could eat solid food.

01:41.352 --> 01:42.353
[sighs]

01:42.436 --> 01:44.104
Weird that a girl who could shrink

01:44.188 --> 01:45.689
had to watch her weight.

01:47.024 --> 01:50.610
So, you're actually gonna
make us dinner tonight?

01:50.694 --> 01:52.112
I'm gonna try.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.948
Is this a zucchini or a cucumber?

01:54.031 --> 01:56.075
Uh, I didn't even get that far.

01:59.078 --> 02:01.705
So, wait, you know how to cook?

02:01.789 --> 02:03.874
No, but that's what the Internet's for.

02:03.958 --> 02:08.002
Come on, I bet Robot's
credit card still works.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.505
You don't have to eat it.

02:09.588 --> 02:13.092
And you don't have to make it.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.927
I want to make dinner, Rex.

02:15.010 --> 02:18.722
I want to buy groceries,
prepare a meal, and then eat it.

02:18.806 --> 02:21.684
You can either help or you can...

02:21.767 --> 02:24.186
I don't know, go do something else.

02:32.444 --> 02:33.362
[Rae gasps]

02:33.445 --> 02:35.239
-[laughs]
-Rex.

02:35.322 --> 02:38.117
[mumbling] Ha!

02:38.200 --> 02:40.369
Parmesan cheese. I like cheese.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.496
How about I'm in charge of that, okay?

02:42.579 --> 02:45.541
You want to be in charge of cheese?

02:45.624 --> 02:47.376
Hell, I'll take butter, too.

02:47.459 --> 02:48.752
Ooh, and milk.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.838
All the cow-type stuff.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.632
You mean dairy?

02:53.716 --> 02:56.802
Ah, whatever you want to call it,
I got it covered.

02:56.886 --> 02:58.470
[explosion]

02:58.554 --> 02:59.680
Huh?

02:59.763 --> 03:01.348
[people screaming]

03:04.101 --> 03:05.394
[roars]

03:06.478 --> 03:09.690
Someone just signed up for an ass-kicking.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.152
[laughs] Come on, Rae.

03:14.153 --> 03:15.738
[groans] Fuck.

03:18.032 --> 03:19.450
[entry bell jingles]

03:27.082 --> 03:28.500
[Robot] Fascinating.

03:28.584 --> 03:29.877
I'm glad you're impressed.

03:29.960 --> 03:33.172
So, it just blew up when you grabbed it?

03:33.255 --> 03:36.008
It was spying on me at my house.

03:36.091 --> 03:37.509
[Monster Girl] Oh, shit.

03:37.593 --> 03:40.638
So, someone knows who you
really are and where you live?

03:40.721 --> 03:44.016
[sighs] It's worse than that.
They know about my family, too.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.893
Hey, Rudy.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.603
Wouldn't this go faster
with your undivided attention?

03:48.687 --> 03:51.357
This is about analysis, not attention.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.317
[Robot] And it is not the only
pressing issue on my plate.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.736
[Monster Girl] Don't do that.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.363
It's creepy.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.406
[footsteps approach]

03:59.490 --> 04:01.408
Whoa. What happened to you two?

04:01.492 --> 04:03.160
Don't ask.

04:04.328 --> 04:07.498
By the way, we're ordering
pizza for dinner.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.211
Are we, like, too weird sometimes?

04:12.294 --> 04:15.255
Should we just be more normal?

04:15.339 --> 04:17.091
What are you talking about?

04:17.173 --> 04:18.425
[Robot] I'm sorry, Mark.

04:18.509 --> 04:20.594
This is too damaged
to ascertain who built it

04:20.678 --> 04:22.262
or who was controlling it.

04:22.346 --> 04:25.099
-I believe that was by design.
-[Mark sighs]

04:25.182 --> 04:27.101
You can't tell me anything about it?

04:27.184 --> 04:28.852
[Robot] It's of Earth origin,

04:28.936 --> 04:30.938
and it's extremely sophisticated.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.106
That's all.

04:32.189 --> 04:34.358
-You should be careful.
-[Monster Girl groans]

04:36.443 --> 04:38.320
[Robot and Rudy] Sorry.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.823
Whoever made this
has significant resources

04:40.906 --> 04:41.907
at their disposal.

04:41.991 --> 04:44.534
Significant resources, huh?

04:44.618 --> 04:45.536
Hmm.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.539
Shit, I know that look.

04:48.622 --> 04:52.084
Tell me you're not about to do
what I think you're about to do.

04:59.008 --> 04:59.925
[screams]

05:01.385 --> 05:02.428
[screams]

05:08.809 --> 05:11.687
-[shrieking tone]
-[groaning]

05:20.446 --> 05:22.197
-[tone stops]
-[Mark panting]

05:22.281 --> 05:25.034
What are you doing here, Mark?

05:25.117 --> 05:27.578
Other than costing taxpayers
millions of dollars

05:27.661 --> 05:30.289
and assaulting a government institution.

05:30.372 --> 05:32.207
You know that's a felony, right?

05:32.291 --> 05:34.251
Might even be treason.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.295
You know exactly why I'm here.

05:36.378 --> 05:39.798
Do me a favor and pretend I don't.

05:40.841 --> 05:42.301
[grunts]

05:42.384 --> 05:44.261
You're spying on us again.

05:49.141 --> 05:52.144
Whatever that thing is, it's not ours.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.938
Don't lie to me, Cecil.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.024
If we wanted to spy on you,

05:57.107 --> 05:59.026
you'd never know it.

05:59.109 --> 06:00.444
Maybe think about that the next time

06:00.527 --> 06:03.489
you decide to punch your way
into the Pentagon.

06:07.284 --> 06:09.328
[sighs]

06:11.914 --> 06:13.082
[phone chimes]

06:14.541 --> 06:17.711
Oh, don't let us keep you.

06:20.798 --> 06:23.967
This. This is not over.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.890
Well, that was a terrifying way
to start my morning.

06:29.973 --> 06:31.683
Jesus, look at this mess.

06:35.104 --> 06:37.439
What do we do if Mark decides
he doesn't believe us?

06:37.523 --> 06:39.525
We hope to hell that doesn't happen.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.319
Besides, it's the truth.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.489
-But we are spying on the Graysons.
-Yeah,

06:45.572 --> 06:48.242
but not with this, Donald.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.869
And I'd really like to know who is.

06:50.953 --> 06:53.789
I'll get the lab boys on it.

07:01.380 --> 07:03.132
Ah, shit.

07:09.138 --> 07:10.889
Sorry I'm late.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.809
Hi, stranger. I thought you forgot

07:13.892 --> 07:15.644
about our second first date.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.771
I was busy committing treason.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.482
I'll tell you about it later.

07:20.566 --> 07:21.567
You know...

07:23.068 --> 07:24.653
...I thought this would be weird.

07:24.736 --> 07:27.906
Not just a date but like a date date.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.825
But the weird thing is--

07:29.908 --> 07:31.660
That it isn't weird?

07:31.743 --> 07:33.078
Yes.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.330
Exactly.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.957
[groans]

07:38.041 --> 07:40.502
Oh. Uh...

07:40.586 --> 07:42.379
Did I misread that?

07:42.462 --> 07:45.174
No, no, you didn't, but...

07:45.257 --> 07:47.342
Please tell me that's not a glowing portal

07:47.426 --> 07:49.303
opening up next to our table.

07:49.386 --> 07:52.973
[sighs] You have no idea
how much I wish I could say that.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.351
[people screaming]

07:57.644 --> 07:59.229
It worked.

07:59.313 --> 08:00.439
We found him.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.441
I told you all that research
would pay off.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.860
[sighs] Seriously? You guys again?

08:04.943 --> 08:07.529
Invincible, you have to come
with us right now.

08:07.613 --> 08:09.698
-It's life and death.
-There's no time to explain.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.450
[both grunt]

08:11.533 --> 08:12.659
Nice one.

08:12.743 --> 08:14.369
You know these jokers?

08:14.453 --> 08:16.455
They stole the Declaration of Independence

08:16.538 --> 08:17.706
when I was busy saving Rex.

08:17.789 --> 08:20.375
Ah, you remember us. That's great.

08:20.459 --> 08:22.294
I'm not sure it is.

08:22.377 --> 08:24.671
I'm Drop Kick and that's Fightmaster.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.799
Despite our awesome names,
we're not looking for trouble.

08:27.883 --> 08:28.842
We need your help.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.469
What? No.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.261
You guys should be in prison.

08:32.346 --> 08:34.556
We had a good reason
to steal the Declaration.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.140
Millions of lives were at stake,

08:36.225 --> 08:38.352
and they still are.

08:38.434 --> 08:39.977
We're from the future.

08:42.397 --> 08:45.192
[sighs] You have ten seconds to explain.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.527
We need you to help us overthrow our king.

08:47.611 --> 08:49.780
When we saw you before,

08:49.863 --> 08:51.823
we realized all the stories were true.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.408
You're the only one strong enough.

08:53.492 --> 08:55.410
What are you even talking about?

08:55.494 --> 08:56.954
Also, if it's a time machine,

08:57.037 --> 09:01.083
can't you come back later? Or earlier?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.794
[Drop Kick] We only have
enough power for this last trip.

09:03.877 --> 09:06.797
You have no idea how many people
died to make it happen.

09:06.880 --> 09:10.884
Look, I'm sorry, but I'm not
going to the future with you,

09:10.968 --> 09:12.636
if that's even where you're from.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.971
You're lucky we're on a date,

09:14.054 --> 09:15.514
or I'd be taking you both to prison.

09:15.597 --> 09:19.059
Maybe you're not the hero
we thought you were.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.978
[scoffs] Guess not.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.399
I really thought that line would work.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.193
[sighs] God, you're an idiot.

09:31.405 --> 09:32.948
Are you sure about this?

09:33.031 --> 09:36.034
Yeah. I'm not ruining our date
just because...

09:36.118 --> 09:37.160
Mark!

09:38.829 --> 09:39.955
[sighs]

09:43.165 --> 09:44.751
[grunting]

09:44.835 --> 09:46.378
Where the hell did you take me?

09:46.461 --> 09:48.171
We told you, the future.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.173
Take me back now.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.759
But you're already here.
We'll prove we're the good guys.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.386
And if you help us,

09:54.469 --> 09:56.179
we'll give you back
the Declaration of Independence.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.684
[Mark] You two better really need me.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.112
Wow. You just have that on all the time?

10:12.195 --> 10:14.114
Hey, you're already on thin ice, buddy.

10:14.197 --> 10:16.074
Where can I stash my clothes?

10:16.158 --> 10:17.200
Hey.

10:19.202 --> 10:21.705
Uh... was that me?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.206
Why'd I look so miserable?

10:23.290 --> 10:26.501
With time travel, it's best not
to ask those kind of questions.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.589
[Mark] Whoa. What happened here?

10:30.672 --> 10:32.591
[Fightmaster] War. Centuries of it.

10:32.674 --> 10:34.718
[Drop Kick] Us versus him,

10:34.801 --> 10:36.094
and we lost.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.721
-[man] Huh?
-[man 2] Huh?

10:39.514 --> 10:41.183
They think we're the king's spies.

10:41.266 --> 10:42.392
They can't break curfew.

10:42.476 --> 10:43.685
In the middle of the day?

10:43.769 --> 10:46.021
All day. Every day.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.939
You're allowed to go out to your work camp

10:48.023 --> 10:49.900
or attend a public execution.

10:49.983 --> 10:53.278
If it's a family member,
but that's about it.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.155
Wait. Start at the beginning.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.908
[Drop Kick] Centuries ago,

He killed people.

24:44.358 --> 24:46.944
And I had to...

24:47.987 --> 24:50.406
I had to stop him.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.617
Forever.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.119
Oh, my God.

24:55.203 --> 24:56.537
He wanted to die.

25:00.249 --> 25:02.335
And it was all my fault.

25:02.418 --> 25:04.962
I left him in charge of the world.

25:05.046 --> 25:07.340
I messed everything up, Eve.

the future version of me wasn't me?

29:28.767 --> 29:31.979
for those of you
with short attention spans.

29:32.062 --> 29:35.566
Forced into a battle against Anissa,
a Viltrumite

29:35.649 --> 29:38.110
with a fearsome reputation,
Allen let himself

29:38.194 --> 29:42.072
be taken prisoner in hopes
of discovering if Nolan Grayson,

29:58.756 --> 30:01.133
But he was also sentenced to death

30:01.217 --> 30:05.054

as per cruel Viltrumite tradition.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.806
Using his implanted communication device,

30:07.890 --> 30:10.768
Allen told Nolan how he visited Mark

30:10.851 --> 30:13.604
to enlist his help in the war
between the Coalition of Planets

30:13.687 --> 30:15.814

30:15.898 --> 30:19.026
Allen begged Nolan to join their cause,

30:19.109 --> 30:20.861
but Nolan refused,

30:20.945 --> 30:23.405
convinced that his execution was justified

30:23.489 --> 30:27.284
for his betrayal
of both Viltrum and Earth.

30:27.368 --> 30:29.995
Still Allen persisted.

30:30.079 --> 30:33.415
It wasn't too late
for Nolan to fix his mistakes,

in their struggle against the Empire.
