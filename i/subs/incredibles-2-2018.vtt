12:49.800 --> 12:51.393
Even when the law
is disrespectful?

12:51.560 --> 12:54.120
If laws are unjust,
there are laws to change them!

12:54.280 --> 12:55.396
Otherwise, it's chaos!

12:55.560 --> 12:57.438
Which is exactly what we have!

13:03.600 --> 13:05.512
I just thought
it was kinda cool.

13:05.720 --> 13:09.396
- What was?
- Fighting crime as a family.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.314
(SIGHS) It was cool.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.634
But it's over.
The world is what it is.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.792
We have to adapt.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.553
Are things bad?

13:19.720 --> 13:21.154
Things are fine.

13:22.520 --> 13:23.636
May I be excused?

13:25.880 --> 13:27.280
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)

13:27.840 --> 13:29.832
How much longer
in the motel, Dad?

13:30.840 --> 13:33.594
- Uh...
- Not much longer, honey.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.040

13:42.080 --> 13:43.514
BOB: I don't know.

Maybe Dicker
will find something?

13:45.440 --> 13:46.760
Dicker is done, Bob.

13:46.920 --> 13:49.992
Any thought we had about being
Supers again is fantasy.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.719
One of us has gotta get a job.

13:51.880 --> 13:52.996
One of us?

You did a long stint
at Insuricare.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.873
Hated every minute of it.

13:57.040 --> 13:58.713
I know it was hard on you.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.553
Maybe it's my turn
in the private sector

14:00.640 --> 14:01.776
and you take care
of the kids...

14:01.800 --> 14:04.759
No, I'm doing this.
I need to do this.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.194
I'm just as illegal
as you guys.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.920
Besides, I knew the cops
would let you go.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.594
Yeah, in spite
of Bob's best efforts.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:44.440 --> 14:47.035

How much longer
are you in this motel?

14:49.080 --> 14:50.230
Two weeks.

14:50.400 --> 14:51.993
Now, you know
the offer still stands.

14:52.200 --> 14:54.396
You're very generous,
but there are five of us.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.119
We wouldn't do that
to you and Honey.

with me, with you two,
about hero stuff.

15:13.560 --> 15:14.676
He's legit.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.353
Trained under Dicker.
He wants to meet.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.597
Ah, jeez!
More superhero trouble.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.520

- When?
- Tonight. I'm going there now.

I'm sitting this one out.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.880

Honey, let's just at least
hear what he has to say.

You got the address,
I'll meet you guys there.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.352
Go in our Supersuits?

15:36.520 --> 15:37.795
Yeah.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.431
Might wanna wear
the old Supersuits.

Got a feeling he's nostalgic.

My father was so proud

that I was even remotely
connected to you guys.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.671
He used to call you

If superheroes had not been
forced underground...

18:36.800 --> 18:37.995
it never would've happened.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.470
Or Dad could've taken Mom
to the safe room

18:40.560 --> 18:41.816
as soon as he knew
there was trouble.

18:41.840 --> 18:43.274

But we're not going
into it right now.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.400
The point is...

18:47.600 --> 18:49.319
nobody expected us

18:49.440 --> 18:51.909
to be able to actually run
Dad's company.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.517
But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator...

18:55.680 --> 18:58.070
uh, we threw ourselves
into building DEVTECH

19:07.040 --> 19:08.759
Hence, this meeting.

19:08.960 --> 19:10.360
Let me ask you something.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.159
What is the main reason

19:12.240 --> 19:13.959
you were all
forced underground?

19:14.120 --> 19:16.077
- Ignorance.
- Perception.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.311
Take today for example,
with the Underminer.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.596
Difficult situation.

19:19.800 --> 19:22.076
You were faced
with a lot of hard decisions.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.310
Oh, tell me about it.

19:23.480 --> 19:24.709
WINSTON: I can't.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.190
Because I didn't see it...

19:27.360 --> 19:29.113
neither did anyone else.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.476
So, when you fight bad guys
like today...

19:31.640 --> 19:34.200
people don't see the fight
or what led up to it.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.551
They see what politicians
tell them to see.

19:36.720 --> 19:39.315
They see destruction
and they see you.

19:39.600 --> 19:41.114
So, if we wanna change

19:41.240 --> 19:43.471
people's perceptions
about superheroes...

19:43.640 --> 19:44.835
we need you

19:44.920 --> 19:47.276
to share your perceptions
with the world.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.318
- How do we do that?
- EVELYN: With cameras.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.394
<i>We need you to share your
perceptions with the world.</i>

19:53.560 --> 19:54.760
ELASTIGIRL: <i>How do we do that?</i>

19:54.920 --> 19:56.912
EVELYN: We embed tiny cameras,
like those,

19:57.000 --> 19:58.195
into your Supersuits.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.476
Wow, so small.

19:59.640 --> 20:01.040
And the picture
is outstanding.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.600
Thanks! Designed 'em myself.

20:03.080 --> 20:04.416
WINSTON: We've got resources,
lobbyists,

20:04.440 --> 20:05.794
worldwide connections...

20:05.960 --> 20:08.111
and very important, insurance.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.509
Insurance is key.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.956
All we need now
are the super-est superheroes.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.396
It needs you three.
Come on!

20:14.560 --> 20:17.598
Help me make all Supers
legal again.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.200
This sounds great!

20:19.400 --> 20:21.320
Let's get this going.
What's my first assignment?

20:21.480 --> 20:23.472
That enthusiasm is golden.

20:23.560 --> 20:25.791
Now hold on to it.
But for our first move...

20:25.960 --> 20:28.794
Well, Elastigirl
is our best play.

- Better than me?

You know.

You're saying what? I'm messy?

20:49.840 --> 20:51.718
Well, Evelyn did
a cost-benefit analysis...

20:51.880 --> 20:54.111
comparing all your last
five years of crime fighting

20:54.200 --> 20:55.793
before going underground.

20:55.960 --> 20:57.792
And Elastigirl's numbers
are self-explanatory.

20:57.960 --> 20:59.872
Well, it's not
a fair comparison!

21:00.040 --> 21:02.600
Heavyweight problems
need heavyweight solutions.

21:02.760 --> 21:04.319
Of course! We're gonna solve

21:04.400 --> 21:06.357
all kinds
of problems together.

21:06.520 --> 21:10.878
After the perfect launch
with Elastigirl!

21:11.720 --> 21:13.473
So, what do you say?

21:14.160 --> 21:16.470
What do I say? (CHUCKLES)

21:17.440 --> 21:19.477
I don't know.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.434
What do you mean,
you don't know?

21:21.600 --> 21:23.751
A few hours ago,
you were saying it was over...

21:23.920 --> 21:26.037
and being a superhero
was a fantasy.

21:26.200 --> 21:28.032
Now, you get the offer
of a lifetime

21:28.120 --> 21:29.395
and you don't know?

21:29.600 --> 21:32.718
It's not that simple, Bob.
I wanna protect the kids!

21:32.880 --> 21:34.280
So do I.

21:34.480 --> 21:36.073
From jail, Bob!

21:36.240 --> 21:37.536
- (SPITS)
- BOB: And how do you do that?

21:37.560 --> 21:39.756
By turning down a chance
to change the law

21:39.840 --> 21:41.360
that forces them to hide
what they are?

21:41.400 --> 21:43.756
They haven't decided what
they are. They're still kids.

21:43.920 --> 21:46.276
Kids with powers,
which makes them Supers...

21:46.440 --> 21:48.716
whether they decide
to use those powers or not.

21:48.880 --> 21:49.996
This will benefit them.

21:50.200 --> 21:51.953
It's not a good time
to be away.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.680
Dash is having trouble
with homework...

21:53.760 --> 21:55.513
Vi is worried
about her first date

21:55.600 --> 21:56.840
with that boy she likes,
Tony...

21:57.040 --> 21:58.040
and Jack-Jack...

21:58.200 --> 21:59.998
Jack-Jack?
What's wrong with him?

22:00.960 --> 22:02.296
Okay, nothing's wrong
with Jack-Jack.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.880
But even a normal baby
needs a lot of attention.

22:05.040 --> 22:06.599
I'm just not sure I can leave.

22:06.800 --> 22:08.029
Of course you can leave.

1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:41.958
Isn't the suit cam
closed circuit?

1:13:42.040 --> 1:13:43.040
It is.

1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:45.556
Then how come
Screenslaver has it?

1:13:45.720 --> 1:13:47.279
Maybe he hacked it?

1:13:47.480 --> 1:13:49.836
So, he's sophisticated enough
to do that...

1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.469
but he has simple locks
on his doors?

1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:54.518
Maybe he wanted you
to find him.

1:13:54.680 --> 1:13:56.000
He wanted to get caught?

1:13:56.200 --> 1:13:58.192
He wanted you to win.

1:13:58.360 --> 1:14:00.431
That makes no sense.
He's a brilliant guy.

1:14:00.600 --> 1:14:01.875
If he's smart enough
to conceive

1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:03.155
of technology like this...

1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:05.789
he's smart enough to think
of something to do with it.

1:14:06.000 --> 1:14:07.878
The guy we put in jail
delivered pizzas.

1:14:07.960 --> 1:14:08.960
So?

1:14:09.120 --> 1:14:10.679
Einstein was a patent clerk.

1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:12.917
Look, you won.
You got the guy who...

1:14:13.080 --> 1:14:15.311
Wait. All Screenslaver
needs to do

1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:16.436
to hypnotise someone...

1:14:16.600 --> 1:14:18.717
is get a screen
in front of their eyes.

1:14:18.880 --> 1:14:22.874
But what if the screen doesn't
look like a screen?

1:14:25.400 --> 1:14:29.553
What if the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy...

1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:31.120
but he was controlled
by the screens

1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:32.160
built into his glasses...

1:14:33.600 --> 1:14:35.432
You are good.

Yes, I'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible.

Don't ask me
to do it again, darling.

Oh, uh...

1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:18.396
I am joking, Robert.
I enjoyed the assignment.

1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:20.279
He is bright
and I am stimulating.

1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:21.840
We deserve each other.

1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:24.671
Your child is a polymorph.

1:15:24.760 --> 1:15:27.150
Like all babies,
he has enormous potential.

1:15:27.320 --> 1:15:28.879
It is not unknown for supers

1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:30.600
to have more than one power
when young...

1:15:30.720 --> 1:15:33.394
- but this little one has many.
- (BABBLING)

1:15:33.480 --> 1:15:36.473

1:15:52.480 --> 1:15:53.709

1:15:53.880 --> 1:15:55.314
Babies can be anything,

1:15:55.400 --> 1:15:56.914
and your child
is no exception.

1:15:57.080 --> 1:15:59.800
He has pure,
unlimited potential, Robert.

1:15:59.960 --> 1:16:02.873
He slept while I worked
in a creative fever.

1:16:03.040 --> 1:16:05.509
Auntie Edna stayed up
all night...

1:16:05.680 --> 1:16:08.195

You're putting him in the...

1:16:10.840 --> 1:16:12.069
In the chamber, Robert.

1:16:12.240 --> 1:16:13.799
He is part
of the demonstration

1:16:13.920 --> 1:16:14.956
and will be fine.

1:16:15.120 --> 1:16:17.032
Your challenge
is to manage a baby

1:16:17.120 --> 1:16:18.600
who has multiple powers...

1:16:18.800 --> 1:16:21.156
and no control over them, yes?

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:23.354
Huh. That sums it up.

1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:24.954
I often work to music

1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:27.794
and I noticed the baby
responds to it as well.

1:16:27.960 --> 1:16:29.838
Specifically, Mozart.

1:16:29.920 --> 1:16:31.696

1:16:31.720 --> 1:16:33.400

1:16:33.720 --> 1:16:35.632
and cotton for comfort.

1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:38.918
Interwoven with these fabrics
are a mesh of tiny sensors...

1:16:39.080 --> 1:16:42.039

physical properties.

1:16:42.240 --> 1:16:45.119
Oh, Lord! (STAMMERS)
What is he doing?

1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:48.193
Well, it's Mozart, Robert.
Can you blame him?

1:16:48.360 --> 1:16:50.431
The important thing is that
the suit and tracker...

1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:52.557
anticipated the change
and alerted you.

1:16:52.720 --> 1:16:55.280
Oh, no. Cookies.
I gotta get cookies!

1:16:55.440 --> 1:16:57.238
You do not need cookies.

1:16:57.400 --> 1:16:59.631
As I learned quite painfully
last night...

1:16:59.840 --> 1:17:01.593
any solution involving cookies

1:17:01.720 --> 1:17:04.440
will inevitably result
in the demon baby.

It means fire, Robert,

1:17:11.800 --> 1:17:13.951
for which the suit
has countermeasures.

1:17:14.120 --> 1:17:16.840
I suggest you extinguish
the baby's flames

1:17:16.920 --> 1:17:18.832
before he trips
the sprinkler system.
