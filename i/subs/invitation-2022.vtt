01:12.114 --> 01:15.242
Ma'am, you must eat something.

01:25.752 --> 01:29.423
You must be terribly weak by now.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.593
I won't do it anymore.

01:35.804 --> 01:36.763
I can't.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.601
You can.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.311
You have to.

01:43.687 --> 01:47.399
Everyone is most concerned
about your behavior--

01:55.949 --> 01:57.159
Close up the stables.

02:42.204 --> 02:43.830
She's-- She's out!

02:43.914 --> 02:45.374
She's out!

02:45.457 --> 02:46.875
Find her!

02:47.626 --> 02:49.169
Look in the cellar!

02:51.672 --> 02:53.131
Somebody check the grounds!

02:53.215 --> 02:54.925
Go, go, go!

02:57.594 --> 02:59.596
Bar the doors! Seal the rooms!

02:59.680 --> 03:01.431
It all ends here...

03:03.725 --> 03:04.601
with me.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.519
Ma'am, wait!

03:06.144 --> 03:08.397
Please! No! Stop!

03:08.480 --> 03:09.898
No!

03:26.206 --> 03:27.374
Thank you.

03:27.457 --> 03:29.209
It's a pleasure to be here with you all,

03:29.293 --> 03:33.297
celebrating the 10-year anniversary
of UnlockYourPast.

03:33.380 --> 03:34.756
Beef carpaccio?

03:34.840 --> 03:38.886
We hit this milestone
because people yearn for connection.

03:39.511 --> 03:42.639
For a sense of family,
a sense of belonging.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.891
Beef carpaccio?

03:43.974 --> 03:48.145
And for the sense of purpose
that comes from knowing who you are.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.148
-You should do it.
-I want you to ask yourself:

03:51.857 --> 03:53.859
-"Who am I?"
-Beef carpaccio?

03:54.985 --> 03:58.238
And "What is my true purpose?"

03:59.156 --> 04:00.991
Beef-fucking-carpaccio.

04:07.623 --> 04:08.957
What a creep!

04:10.000 --> 04:10.918
You gonna call him?

04:11.502 --> 04:13.003
No. Gross.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.255
If you not gonna call him, maybe I will.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.091
Evie, don't judge.
You know how hard it is out here.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.137
Can you imagine being that rich?

04:22.221 --> 04:24.389
Just walking around like you own people.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.475
Girl, he probably does own people.

04:26.558 --> 04:28.477
Wanted to add you to the roster.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.897
So I got a boob graze
and a butt grab tonight.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.190
How about you?

04:33.273 --> 04:35.359
Dos to the tetas.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.737
-Frisky.
-You want me to call HR for you?

04:39.238 --> 04:41.990
Oh, hey, Tony.
We were just messing around.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.158
Just jokes.

04:43.909 --> 04:46.411
You know there are plenty of other girls

04:46.495 --> 04:48.747
who would be grateful for this gig.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.712
What an asshat.

04:57.422 --> 05:00.384
I did grab us a swag bag.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.636
This one's got
little bottles of wine in them.

05:02.719 --> 05:03.679
My favorite!

05:04.304 --> 05:06.640
And there's a DNA test in there too.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.101
Anyway, I gotta run.
You know I got my midterm tomorrow.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.227
You're gonna crush it.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.187
I know. See you later.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.154
Excuse me.

06:00.527 --> 06:03.197
Hi, Evie love. It's Mom.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.782
Happy birthday!

06:06.408 --> 06:09.578
You are such an amazingly talented artist.

06:09.661 --> 06:13.040
And I know you have big,
big things ahead of you.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.791
I'm so proud of you.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.960
And your dad would be too.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.130
And I know you're worried
about being alone,

06:20.214 --> 06:22.132
but I'll always be with you.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.719
Just know that when things are hard,

06:26.345 --> 06:28.680
you're stronger than you think you are.

06:29.640 --> 06:31.266
I love you to the moon and back.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.601
Love you too, Mom.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.729
Okay, bye-bye, sweetie.

07:02.631 --> 07:07.594
Unlocking your family history
is as easy as DNA!

07:07.678 --> 07:10.931
Collect your sample, seal it,
and mail it back to us.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.183
You'll get an e-mail
when your results are ready.

07:13.684 --> 07:17.604
And don't forget to tick the box
to notify your newfound relatives.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.894
Did you ever go out on a date
with that bartender guy?

07:57.686 --> 07:59.479
-I'm ignoring his texts.
-Why?

08:00.063 --> 08:01.481
I thought you said you liked him.

08:01.565 --> 08:04.735
I can't handle the New York
dating scene right now.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.862
It is exhausting.

08:11.533 --> 08:12.534
No way!

08:12.618 --> 08:13.619
What?

08:16.079 --> 08:17.331
I got a cousin.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.041
Holy shit!

08:19.791 --> 08:23.128
-That is the whitest man I've ever seen.
-He wants to meet up.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.673
A stranger? Off the Internet?

08:27.633 --> 08:28.800
You're not doing that.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.637
He's family, and I don't have any.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.306
So you wanna be catfished? Interesting.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.974
I mean, look, he's wearing an ascot.

08:36.058 --> 08:38.101
What could he possibly want
with my broke ass?

08:38.184 --> 08:41.938
Your kidneys.
That's probably exactly what this site is.

08:42.022 --> 08:45.609
Tinder for unassuming organ donors.
Says right there in the corner.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.820
And he's British.
They're all absurdly polite.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.573
Yeah, because
they're racked with colonial guilt.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.076
Doesn't mean you need
to mistake that for good manners.

08:54.159 --> 08:55.702
I'm sorry, whose last,

08:55.786 --> 08:58.247
wait, three boyfriends were white?

08:59.039 --> 09:00.874
We are unpacking that in therapy.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.292
Don't do me like that.

09:02.793 --> 09:04.461
Look, all I'm saying is,

09:04.545 --> 09:06.755
leopards don't usually change their spots.

09:16.098 --> 09:17.558
Cousin Oliver.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.327
Oliver?

09:37.995 --> 09:38.829
Evelyn?

09:39.329 --> 09:41.081
Hi! Please have a seat.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.083
You can just call me Evie.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.293
Cousin Evie!

09:45.210 --> 09:48.547
It sounds so Jane Austen
when you say it like that.

09:49.840 --> 09:52.342
So you're in town for work?

09:52.426 --> 09:54.887
Yeah, family business. Real estate.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.723
Sounds exciting.

09:57.806 --> 09:58.849
Not in the slightest.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.812
Okay, tell me everything about yourself.

10:03.896 --> 10:07.232
Work, relationship status.
I want to know it all.

10:07.316 --> 10:10.319
Well, I am trying to get my MFA,

10:10.819 --> 10:13.822
but I'm mostly just freelancing right now.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.909
Catering, really.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.161
And I'm very much single.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.246
Oh, God. Me too. Painfully so.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.498
What about your parents?
Are they in New York too?

10:24.082 --> 10:24.958
My dad...

10:25.459 --> 10:26.752
My dad died when I was 14,

10:26.835 --> 10:29.755
and my mom passed
just a few months ago, actually.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.217
I'm so sorry.

10:33.759 --> 10:34.676
Thanks.

10:35.761 --> 10:38.472
You know, she was sick
for a while. Cancer.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.433
But, you know, she always wanted
to take me to England,

10:41.517 --> 10:44.394
so we could learn
about our family history.

10:44.478 --> 10:45.646
-So...
-Yes.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.065
Well, it's quite fascinating, actually.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.858
You're part of the family scandal.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.070
Just before her nuptials in 1925,

10:53.153 --> 10:57.658
your great-grandmother, Emmaline,
had an illicit affair with a footman.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.160
A Black footman?

11:00.911 --> 11:02.454
Well, evidently, yeah.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.374
I imagine that was quite the scandal.

11:05.457 --> 11:07.626
God, yeah. Then she kept it
a secret from everyone,

11:07.709 --> 11:08.961
including her future husband.

11:09.044 --> 11:10.796
Quite the rebel, your great-grandmother.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.842
So, what happened to my grandfather?

11:14.925 --> 11:16.468
The baby?

11:16.552 --> 11:18.720
It turns out, the footman left the village

11:18.804 --> 11:22.057
and raised the baby,
your grandfather, on his own.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.142
Scandals aren't what they used to be

11:24.226 --> 11:26.687
because everyone
is utterly overjoyed by the news.

11:26.770 --> 11:27.771
Everyone?

11:27.855 --> 11:29.523
I can't keep secrets.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.276
The whole Alexander family
knows about you.

11:32.359 --> 11:35.946
Great Uncle Alfred, Uncle Julius,
my three brothers, all the cousins.

11:36.655 --> 11:38.740
There's a wedding
coming up, actually. My--

11:39.366 --> 11:40.951
Our cousin Martin

11:41.034 --> 11:43.495
is getting married in a few weeks.

11:43.579 --> 11:47.416
Huge celebration
in the English countryside, really posh.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.668
That's him and his fiancée, Cecile.

11:50.294 --> 11:52.963
She's one of the De Villes. Très riche.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.882
It's going to be
the wedding of the century.

11:55.507 --> 11:56.925
You know what? You should come!

11:58.510 --> 12:00.679
-What?
-To the wedding. You should come.

12:01.597 --> 12:05.851
I'd love to,
but I cannot afford a trip right now.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.519
Don't be silly, our treat.

12:07.603 --> 12:10.314
I've got so many frequent-flier miles.
You'd be doing me a favor.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.942
Oliver, really, thank you,
but that is too much to ask.

12:14.026 --> 12:16.862
And Great Uncle Alfred
is dying to meet you, literally.

12:16.945 --> 12:19.698
He's 89 and quite frail.
He would love for us all to be together.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.241
It's a brilliant idea!

12:21.742 --> 12:22.951
I just...

12:24.161 --> 12:25.120
Are you serious?

12:27.039 --> 12:31.084
I can't imagine what you've gone through
after losing your mother.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.879
It's tragic, but you still have family.

12:33.962 --> 12:37.090
You could fulfill your mother's wish
by taking the trip she always wanted.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.677
Worst-case scenario, it's an all-expenses-
paid trip to Whitby, Yorkshire.

12:40.761 --> 12:43.597
You just have to tolerate
my terrible sense of humor for a few days.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.057
Come on, say yes.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.066
Hey, girl. How's the motherland?

12:54.149 --> 12:55.692
You know, it feels good.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.402
I'm excited to meet my family.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.738
I'm excited for you!

12:59.821 --> 13:01.782
Now, what are the three rules?

13:02.491 --> 13:04.159
Eat, pray, love?

13:04.243 --> 13:06.453
Girl, if you wind up dead in a ditch,

13:06.537 --> 13:08.497
I'm telling you, I'm not helping.

13:08.580 --> 13:10.040
Okay, okay.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.501
Uhh... send you a picture
of the license plate,

13:12.584 --> 13:15.003
text you when I go to sleep, and...

13:15.087 --> 13:16.505
And don't trust...

13:16.588 --> 13:18.674
-Don't trust men with goatees.
-...men with goatees.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.342
-No.
-There you go.

13:20.425 --> 13:22.052
I'm at arrivals. I'll call you later.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.596
Okay, well, if you see Idris Elba,
say hi to him for me.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.348
-All right, bye.
-Evie.

13:26.431 --> 13:27.683
You made it!

13:28.934 --> 13:29.768
Hi.

13:30.394 --> 13:31.395
How was the flight?

13:31.979 --> 13:34.022
You've ruined coach forever.

13:34.106 --> 13:35.023
My pleasure.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.943
-Ready for an adventure?
-I guess.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.361
Come on. Let's go.

13:46.076 --> 13:47.828
So who lives here again?

13:47.911 --> 13:49.162
The De Ville family.

13:49.246 --> 13:52.416
But our family will be staying
the weekend for the festivities.

13:55.294 --> 13:56.795
Holy shit.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.216
Are they royalty or something?

14:01.300 --> 14:03.552
No. It's just old money.

14:03.635 --> 14:04.761
England's full of it.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.015
Right this way.

14:08.765 --> 14:09.892
There you are.

14:10.517 --> 14:11.685
Watch your step.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.065
There you go.

14:19.943 --> 14:20.819
All right.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.281
Definitely, you must be
on your best behavior.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.418
Welcome to New Carfax Abbey.

14:37.586 --> 14:40.297
It's... incredible.

14:40.839 --> 14:42.424
Let me go find our host.

14:48.597 --> 14:51.183
All right. Text a photo
of the license plate.

14:51.808 --> 14:52.726
Shit!

14:52.809 --> 14:54.770
I am so sorry.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.980
No, miss. We're sorry.

14:57.064 --> 14:58.106
Very sorry.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.401
Oh, please, miss, we'll clean this up.

15:01.485 --> 15:04.446
It's okay. If we don't help
each other out, who will, right?

15:04.988 --> 15:06.532
I'm Evie, by the way.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.201
I'm Diya.

15:09.910 --> 15:11.286
Or Dee is fine too.

15:11.370 --> 15:12.579
I'm Imogen.

15:12.663 --> 15:14.331
And what has happened here?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.250
Oh, hi. It was me. I--

15:16.333 --> 15:18.377
Clean it up immediately.
We have guests arriving.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.795
Yes, sir. Of course.

15:20.712 --> 15:21.922
It was really my fault.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.341
I don't care whose fault it was.
Just get rid of it.

15:25.259 --> 15:27.052
There's no need to be snarky about it.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.554
I beg your pardon?

15:29.137 --> 15:30.305
Did I stutter?

15:30.389 --> 15:31.765
At ease, Mr. Field.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.560
I believe this is
one of our important guests.

15:36.144 --> 15:37.813
And that makes a difference?

15:38.605 --> 15:40.399
My sincerest apologies, ma'am.

15:41.733 --> 15:42.568
Sir.

15:43.527 --> 15:44.653
Thank you, ladies.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.740
Sorry about that.
He can be quite demanding.

15:48.824 --> 15:50.158
More like an asshole.

15:50.701 --> 15:52.327
Oh, so you must be Evelyn.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.705
-Evie. And you are?
-Walter!

15:56.874 --> 15:59.376
You've beat me to the punch.
You've been introduced?

15:59.459 --> 16:00.335
-No.
-Yeah.

16:01.420 --> 16:02.796
Well, not formally.

16:02.880 --> 16:06.175
Well, this is my cousin who I was
telling you about, Evie Alexander.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.343
It's Jackson, really.

16:08.427 --> 16:11.555
Evie, this is the lord of the manor,
Walter De Ville.

16:13.307 --> 16:14.975
You can just call me Walt.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.979
-Hi, Walt.
-Hi.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.899
Yeah, so I was the one
who ran into them

16:21.982 --> 16:24.610
and the glasses, so...

16:24.693 --> 16:26.612
Yeah, it really wasn't their fault.

16:26.695 --> 16:29.239
Okay, so, you're the klutz. Got it.

16:30.616 --> 16:33.994
-Is this a gift for the happy couple?
-Yeah.

16:34.077 --> 16:35.454
-May I?
-Oh, yeah.

16:35.537 --> 16:37.247
I made it.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.295
It's very impressive.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.798
Sir? The grounds are ready for inspection.

16:47.883 --> 16:49.176
Well, excuse me.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.721
I hope you enjoy your time
at New Carfax, Evie.

16:55.516 --> 16:58.769
Oh, and thank you
for letting me stay. Your...

17:00.771 --> 17:03.273
mansion, it's beautiful.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.318
My home is your home.

17:09.988 --> 17:12.074
Well, that was only mildly awkward.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.909
I'm sure he got a kick out of it.

17:13.992 --> 17:16.161
Sir, may I escort the lady...

17:17.204 --> 17:18.413
to her bedroom?

17:18.497 --> 17:22.166
Evie, this is Mr. Field,
head butler here at New Carfax.

17:22.251 --> 17:23.417
Yeah, we met.

17:28.841 --> 17:29.716
I got it.

17:32.594 --> 17:33.554
Have fun.

17:34.555 --> 17:37.683
You're most welcome to venture
anywhere within the estate, ma'am.

17:37.766 --> 17:40.102
Except the library. We're renovating.

17:42.938 --> 17:45.399
Are these all real?

17:46.108 --> 17:49.236
I can assure you
everything is authentic, ma'am.

17:50.320 --> 17:52.489
The master
is a great supporter of the arts.

18:03.125 --> 18:07.212
Allow me to introduce you
to your lady's maid, Mrs. Swift.

18:07.754 --> 18:08.922
I get a maid?

18:09.548 --> 18:10.507
Of course.

18:10.591 --> 18:12.176
Hi. I'm Evie.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.555
Welcome, miss.

18:16.638 --> 18:17.890
Right this way.

18:33.363 --> 18:34.740
This is my room?

18:35.365 --> 18:36.992
Is it to your liking, miss?

18:38.660 --> 18:39.494
Yeah.

18:44.833 --> 18:48.045
That is... something.

18:48.128 --> 18:50.005
A gift from the maids of honor.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.257
There's more than one?

18:52.341 --> 18:54.843
Yes, it's a De Ville tradition.

18:55.928 --> 18:58.972
The mirror broke last week,
but we've ordered a new one.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.350
Isn't that seven years bad luck?

19:08.649 --> 19:09.942
What's with the bars?

19:10.025 --> 19:12.402
The shrikes are quite aggressive
this time of year.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.112
Shrikes?

19:14.196 --> 19:15.906
Local carnivorous birds, miss.

19:16.448 --> 19:18.992
They exhibit
a peculiar strain of brutality.

19:19.076 --> 19:22.454
They impale their prey on thorns.

19:22.955 --> 19:25.624
Legend has it
one plucked out a stable boy's eye

19:25.707 --> 19:27.000
and stuck it on a fence spike.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.086
Gave the maids quite a fright.

19:29.837 --> 19:30.963
Holy shit.

19:39.054 --> 19:40.347
-Miss?
-Yeah?

19:40.889 --> 19:43.183
This is the service bell.

19:43.267 --> 19:45.686
Just pull it if you need assistance.

19:47.145 --> 19:48.480
Yes, like that.

19:49.815 --> 19:52.359
-Please don't.
-Sorry.

19:59.324 --> 20:00.284
Who's that?

20:01.785 --> 20:03.453
A former lady of the house.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.498
Well, she looks thrilled to be here.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.459
She was a woman of great depth.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.838
She passed away recently.

20:15.757 --> 20:18.427
I'm... so sorry.

20:19.845 --> 20:24.725
I know the pain of losing someone
never really quite leaves you.

20:27.519 --> 20:29.688
Is there anything else
you'll be needing, miss?

20:30.189 --> 20:31.190
No.

20:31.273 --> 20:34.526
I promise,
I'll be your easiest customer yet.

20:36.111 --> 20:37.196
Thank you, miss.

20:57.299 --> 20:58.675
Is that a four-poster bed?

20:58.759 --> 21:00.886
G, this place is insane.

21:00.969 --> 21:03.430
They got drawing rooms and service bells.

21:03.514 --> 21:05.140
All right. Well, don't get lured in.

21:05.224 --> 21:08.143
Next thing you know,
you'll be posing for nude portraits.

21:08.227 --> 21:12.105
And I made a total ass of myself
with the lord of the manor.

21:12.189 --> 21:14.149
Did you overdo it on the bubbly again?

21:14.650 --> 21:16.652
Maybe. But in my defense,

21:16.735 --> 21:18.820
his butler was being
an entitled douchebag,

21:18.904 --> 21:22.699
and then the lord swooped in
and saved the day.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.826
Did I mention he's hot?

21:24.910 --> 21:26.328
Wait. The butler or the lord?

21:26.912 --> 21:28.121
The lord, Walt.

21:28.205 --> 21:30.207
And you'd think
he'd be like 100 years old,

21:30.290 --> 21:32.251
but he's our age.

21:32.334 --> 21:33.377
Hold up.

21:34.753 --> 21:35.712
Hang on a sec.

21:43.387 --> 21:44.721
-Hi.
-Hi. Walt.

21:45.264 --> 21:48.559
I'm sorry to bother you so late.
I saw the light on under your door.

21:48.642 --> 21:49.643
What's up?

21:50.143 --> 21:52.229
I just wanted to apologize again.

21:52.312 --> 21:55.315
Our butler, he's a bit old-fashioned.

21:55.816 --> 21:57.109
I hope you weren't offended.

21:58.861 --> 22:00.112
I was, actually.

22:02.447 --> 22:03.782
I am sorry.

22:03.866 --> 22:04.867
I'm sorry. I'll--

22:05.617 --> 22:06.618
I'll talk to him.

22:07.828 --> 22:10.956
Is there any chance
we can erase the memory and start over?

22:11.790 --> 22:13.458
I don't know if that's possible,

22:13.542 --> 22:17.880
but you could maybe make
a better second impression.

22:18.881 --> 22:19.965
Right, okay.

22:20.048 --> 22:23.427
And... how am I doing with that?

22:24.052 --> 22:26.138
Solid seven-and-a-half.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.017
Maybe an eight.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.103
Okay. That's a start at least.

22:35.731 --> 22:38.775
I trust your accommodation
meets your high standards?

22:38.859 --> 22:41.153
I mean, I can live with this.

22:41.236 --> 22:42.696
-Yeah? Are you sure?
-Yeah. Yeah.

22:42.779 --> 22:45.324
Okay. Well, thank you for tolerating it.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.160
Thank you for apologizing.

22:50.621 --> 22:52.497
I am going to let you get some rest.

22:54.374 --> 22:57.211
I'm glad that you decided
to make the trip over.

22:58.045 --> 23:00.130
I'm looking forward
to getting to know you better.

23:01.465 --> 23:02.299
Me too.

23:03.592 --> 23:04.968
Good night, Evie.

23:05.594 --> 23:06.595
Night, Walt.

23:09.389 --> 23:11.058
I do believe our Miss Evelyn

23:11.141 --> 23:13.769
-is gonna get some destination wedding D.
-Stop, all right?

23:13.852 --> 23:15.646
He is just being a good host.

23:15.729 --> 23:19.149
-Are you seriously gonna deny that accent?
-What happened to "don't trust anyone"?

23:19.233 --> 23:21.568
Anyone with goatees. He's a lord!

23:21.652 --> 23:24.279
And you and I both know
it's been a minute since you had some.

23:24.363 --> 23:26.156
Okay. I'm gonna go for a jog.

23:26.240 --> 23:27.866
You better snog him!

24:12.995 --> 24:13.954
...ends here.

24:16.415 --> 24:18.083
It all ends here...

24:21.879 --> 24:22.754
with me.

24:38.562 --> 24:39.396
Evie...

25:14.306 --> 25:16.517
We must wait here
for your assignment, ladies.

25:18.310 --> 25:19.978
Should be any moment now.

25:56.223 --> 25:58.308
Jesus! You scared me.

25:58.892 --> 26:02.145
Miss, you should return to your room.
It's not safe in the dark.

26:02.229 --> 26:04.147
I just wanted some water.

26:09.778 --> 26:10.612
Two.

26:11.655 --> 26:12.948
You're to clean the library.

26:14.157 --> 26:15.951
The rest of you, return to your quarters.

26:16.034 --> 26:17.119
Yes, sir.

26:20.664 --> 26:22.249
What are they doing down there?

26:22.332 --> 26:24.543
Final cleaning rounds, miss.

26:26.420 --> 26:28.088
Please, go back to bed.

26:28.797 --> 26:31.842
I'll make you a chamomile tea
to help with the jet lag.

26:36.305 --> 26:37.472
Come on now.

27:59.763 --> 28:02.766
I've never seen two men move

28:03.517 --> 28:05.894
Hand in hand Coldharbour Lane

28:10.941 --> 28:11.775
Hello?

28:32.129 --> 28:38.510
Just like a dream
To me, dear you see

28:38.594 --> 28:45.267
Like a dream of so long, long ago...

29:10.792 --> 29:12.503
Excuse me, miss?

29:12.586 --> 29:14.963
I believe your family reunion is starting.

29:15.047 --> 29:16.089
Oh, shit.

29:28.602 --> 29:29.686
There she is.

29:30.229 --> 29:32.981
Hi. I'm so sorry. I overslept.

29:33.065 --> 29:34.983
"Party late, sleep late," I say.

29:35.067 --> 29:36.693
I'm your Uncle Julius.

29:36.777 --> 29:39.988
And, you know,
we're all so delighted that you're here.

29:40.072 --> 29:41.532
I'm delighted too.

29:44.701 --> 29:45.827
A toast.

29:46.912 --> 29:48.997
Great Uncle Alfred, patriarch.

29:50.749 --> 29:53.585
Just wanted to take this moment

29:54.169 --> 29:58.841
to welcome Evelyn to the family.

29:58.924 --> 30:03.971
I was overjoyed
when Oliver told me of your existence.

30:04.054 --> 30:06.139
What a gift!

30:06.765 --> 30:08.976
We are so blessed.

30:09.059 --> 30:11.353
It truly means more to me...

30:12.437 --> 30:13.689
to us...

30:14.898 --> 30:16.441
than you can ever know.

30:17.776 --> 30:20.487
So many boys...

30:21.655 --> 30:23.615
we thought we were done for.

30:32.583 --> 30:33.500
My turn?

30:37.337 --> 30:40.465
All right.
First, I'd like to thank Oliver.

30:40.549 --> 30:42.384
You sure know how to spoil a girl.

30:44.052 --> 30:46.680
And I'd like to thank all of you...

30:47.931 --> 30:49.933
for welcoming me with open arms.

30:51.852 --> 30:56.231
It was always just my mom, my dad and me.

30:56.857 --> 30:57.691
Now...

30:59.610 --> 31:02.571
to learn I have this whole new family...

31:04.323 --> 31:05.324
well, it's--

31:06.950 --> 31:08.785
It's like a dream, so...

31:09.411 --> 31:11.163
-To Evie!

31:15.250 --> 31:16.293
Oh, thanks.

31:17.044 --> 31:18.337
It's Dee, right?

31:20.797 --> 31:25.010
A certain Mr. De Ville
was inquiring about your whereabouts.

31:26.178 --> 31:27.179
Really?

31:27.262 --> 31:29.389
He seems to be quite charmed by you.

31:30.015 --> 31:31.350
I mean, can you blame him?

31:31.433 --> 31:32.684
Absolutely not.

31:34.561 --> 31:35.395
So Walt--

31:36.647 --> 31:37.731
Mr. De Ville...

31:38.899 --> 31:42.736
we're not related, right?

31:44.029 --> 31:45.280
Not in the slightest.

31:46.114 --> 31:48.242
Yeah, okay. I was, you know, just...

31:49.034 --> 31:49.993
making sure.

32:04.800 --> 32:05.717
You.

32:06.468 --> 32:07.427
Follow me.

32:18.522 --> 32:23.360
The master of the house
has requested the 1897 Vino Cruor.

32:24.111 --> 32:26.071
You need both of us to go get it?

32:27.698 --> 32:29.950
You have a propensity to break things.

32:45.674 --> 32:47.134
What's his problem?

32:47.801 --> 32:49.845
Let's just find it, and get out of here.

32:50.637 --> 32:51.597
Okay.

33:20.167 --> 33:21.502
Shit.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.676
-Here.
-Thanks.

33:51.615 --> 33:53.158
Your face!

33:53.242 --> 33:54.868
Stop messing about.

34:06.922 --> 34:07.798
I said, quit.

34:15.389 --> 34:16.389
Over here!

34:37.578 --> 34:39.079
It's stuck at the back!

34:41.081 --> 34:42.206
Hey.

34:43.750 --> 34:44.960
Dee, what's wrong?

34:46.879 --> 34:47.754
Dee!

34:48.547 --> 34:49.380
Behind you!

35:00.225 --> 35:01.393
Dee.

35:49.691 --> 35:51.735
So, how's the fam?

35:51.818 --> 35:53.153
Very white.

35:53.237 --> 35:54.446
So you fit right in?

35:56.031 --> 35:58.325
Actually, they were really sweet.

35:58.408 --> 36:01.495
Great Uncle Alfred even shed a tear.

36:01.578 --> 36:05.040
That is so cute. I love when old men cry.

36:05.624 --> 36:08.085
Did you flirt
with the lord of the manor today?

36:08.544 --> 36:12.673
Not yet, but he gave me this dress
to wear tonight.

36:15.467 --> 36:18.887
Wow. Evie, that's quite the gesture.

36:18.971 --> 36:21.265
I know. I wonder
what he expects in return.

36:21.348 --> 36:22.808
Well, you know what they say.

36:22.891 --> 36:24.810
"When a man buys you a dress..."

36:24.893 --> 36:26.103
What do they say?

36:27.271 --> 36:29.481
What happened? Are you okay?

36:31.733 --> 36:33.235
Evie? Hello?

36:33.318 --> 36:34.778
Yeah. I'm fine.

36:36.321 --> 36:37.698
It was just a shrike.

36:37.781 --> 36:39.449
What the fuck is a shrike?

36:40.325 --> 36:41.159
Evie!

37:06.226 --> 37:07.394
Announcing...

37:08.437 --> 37:11.607
Miss Evelyn Alexander!

37:22.534 --> 37:24.536
I was not expecting that.

37:25.037 --> 37:26.205
You look divine.

37:26.830 --> 37:29.541
Own it.
You're an Alexander now, remember?

37:30.209 --> 37:31.835
That seems to be official, huh?

37:31.919 --> 37:34.421
-Would you like some champagne?
-Thank you.

37:36.256 --> 37:37.424
Beef carpaccio, miss?

37:37.508 --> 37:39.843
Oh, God, no. Thank you, though.

37:40.511 --> 37:43.347
-That dress is gorgeous.
-Thank you. It was a gift.

37:44.306 --> 37:45.265
Announcing...

37:45.349 --> 37:46.391
Cheers.

37:46.892 --> 37:48.227
The maids of honor...

37:49.311 --> 37:53.899
Viktoria Klopstock and Lucy Billington!

37:59.988 --> 38:01.949
Wow. They're popular.

38:04.034 --> 38:06.954
-We finally meet.
-You must be Evie.

38:07.037 --> 38:08.163
Yeah, hi.

38:09.122 --> 38:10.082
You're American.

38:11.583 --> 38:13.460
I was expecting something else.

38:14.419 --> 38:16.338
Well, this is what you get.

38:16.964 --> 38:18.423
What were your names again?

38:18.507 --> 38:20.008
I'm Lucy, and this is...

38:20.092 --> 38:21.385
Viktoria.

38:22.511 --> 38:24.847
We just wanted to extend
a warm welcome here.

38:24.930 --> 38:27.057
So thrilled to have you join us.

38:27.140 --> 38:28.809
Stop trying so hard.

38:30.727 --> 38:31.895
Thank you, Lucy.

38:31.979 --> 38:34.231
I'm equally thrilled to be here.

38:34.940 --> 38:35.941
You're very pretty.

38:39.611 --> 38:40.445
Thank you.

38:41.280 --> 38:42.197
So are you.

38:42.906 --> 38:45.242
Oliver has told us so much about you.

38:45.325 --> 38:48.453
Don't believe a word.
He has a penchant for flattery.

38:49.121 --> 38:50.497
So, how do you know Cecile?

38:52.583 --> 38:53.876
The bride.

38:55.419 --> 38:58.380
Cece, we have known her for years.

38:58.463 --> 39:01.383
All of our families have served
the De Villes for generations.

39:01.466 --> 39:04.469
My family, the Billingtons,
handle their legal affairs.

39:04.553 --> 39:07.097
The Klopstocks manage their finances.

39:07.639 --> 39:08.765
And as I'm sure you know,

39:08.849 --> 39:11.810
the Alexanders find them
these incredible homes.

39:11.894 --> 39:13.896
Your life in New York, it sounds...

39:13.979 --> 39:15.689
terribly humdrum.

39:16.190 --> 39:19.484
How fortunate that your cousin plucked you
out of thin air and brought you here

39:20.194 --> 39:21.069
to us.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.285
I'm gonna get a refill.

39:28.368 --> 39:30.412
It was nice to meet you, Lucy.

39:42.257 --> 39:43.467
Champagne, please.

39:46.929 --> 39:48.847
I've always wanted to visit New York.

39:50.015 --> 39:51.558
I'll take the rouge privé.

39:52.434 --> 39:54.353
It's only a hop over the pond.

39:55.270 --> 39:58.899
Yes. I don't travel much, I'm afraid.

39:59.483 --> 40:01.818
Well, you should. I'll show you around.

40:02.528 --> 40:04.655
-You would?
-Of course.

40:04.738 --> 40:07.324
I'll take you to the secret spots.

40:07.950 --> 40:09.326
I would love that.

40:09.409 --> 40:12.037
That would be unbelievable.

40:12.120 --> 40:14.665
Thank you. In advance.

40:15.290 --> 40:17.334
You're welcome. In advance.

40:18.669 --> 40:22.256
The Lord of New Carfax Abbey...

40:23.006 --> 40:24.675
Walter De Ville!

40:46.363 --> 40:47.489
Wait. What are you doing?

40:47.573 --> 40:49.783
It's customary
that I have the first dance.

40:49.867 --> 40:51.368
I don't know any dances.

40:51.451 --> 40:53.036
It's fine. Just follow my lead.

40:53.704 --> 40:54.621
Oh, God.

40:57.666 --> 40:58.959
Get out of your head.

41:01.628 --> 41:03.922
-Ready?
-No.

41:04.006 --> 41:06.341
Two, three, one, two, three.

41:07.342 --> 41:08.719
Oh, no.

41:11.722 --> 41:13.098
Are you enjoying yourself?

41:14.558 --> 41:15.726
I am.

41:16.393 --> 41:20.189
But I can't shake the feeling
that everyone is staring at me.

41:21.481 --> 41:22.900
Can you blame them?

41:34.369 --> 41:35.579
Don't gloat.

41:36.246 --> 41:38.874
You must admit,
she has a certain je ne sais quoi.

41:38.957 --> 41:41.960
Oh, yes, her accent gets
right into the inner ear canal.

41:42.461 --> 41:45.380
You even make jealousy
look radiant, Viktoria.

41:47.341 --> 41:49.843
I suppose congratulations are in order.

41:50.969 --> 41:52.679
A female Alexander.

41:54.264 --> 41:56.725
And here I thought you were all dried up.

42:02.397 --> 42:04.107
Do you want to get out of here?

42:04.733 --> 42:07.069
Don't you have to host your party?

42:08.278 --> 42:09.279
Yeah.

42:10.447 --> 42:12.157
There's too many sycophants.

42:12.991 --> 42:14.910
I prefer real conversation.

42:27.297 --> 42:28.632
-Got it.
-There you go.

42:29.508 --> 42:30.384
Thank you.

42:31.802 --> 42:33.679
So, do you ever get bored here?

42:34.388 --> 42:36.056
Yeah. More often than you'd think.

42:37.182 --> 42:39.977
I just don't see how
that's physically possible.

42:41.144 --> 42:44.064
Well, even a life of indulgence
has its drawbacks.

42:44.147 --> 42:45.440
Are there wolves in England?

42:46.525 --> 42:48.235
Americans. Wolves?

42:48.318 --> 42:51.613
We've not had wolves in over 400 years.

42:53.240 --> 42:56.743
Knowledge or nudity?
What's it gonna be, Eve?

42:57.411 --> 43:00.789
This is 17th century?

43:01.331 --> 43:03.208
Well done. 1632.

43:03.834 --> 43:05.043
It's beautiful.

43:08.130 --> 43:09.506
And what's that building?

43:09.590 --> 43:11.800
The icehouse. From a bygone era.

43:13.260 --> 43:14.428
Before refrigeration.

43:14.511 --> 43:16.597
But I have something better to show you.

43:31.778 --> 43:33.030
Is this yours?

43:34.531 --> 43:37.451
But sadly, not all of us have talent.

43:38.118 --> 43:39.494
Want to give it a spin?

43:39.953 --> 43:41.163
In this dress?

43:41.622 --> 43:43.498
It's fine. I'll just buy you a new one.

43:45.501 --> 43:47.669
Sorry. I know how that sounded.

43:47.753 --> 43:48.837
It's okay.

43:49.296 --> 43:51.548
I get it. You're, like, Rockefeller rich,
or whatever.

43:51.632 --> 43:52.758
It's fine.

43:53.425 --> 43:55.511
So, what drew you to pottery?

43:55.594 --> 43:57.262
Ceramics.

43:57.346 --> 43:58.889
Apologies. Ceramics.

43:59.932 --> 44:01.183
My mom.

44:01.266 --> 44:02.601
It was one of her hobbies.

44:03.227 --> 44:07.981
When I was a kid, she taught me
how to make bowls, and mugs,

44:08.065 --> 44:10.400
goofy clay sculptures.

44:12.361 --> 44:15.489
It must have moved her to know
that you grew up to be an artist.

44:15.572 --> 44:18.033
I'd use the term "artist" loosely,

44:18.116 --> 44:21.119
but, yeah, I think it did.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.581
Now that she's gone...

44:25.666 --> 44:27.292
it keeps me close to her.

44:31.755 --> 44:32.840
What about your parents?

44:34.550 --> 44:36.844
They're no longer with us.

44:40.097 --> 44:41.974
It was a long, long time ago.

44:42.766 --> 44:43.809
Look at us.

44:44.726 --> 44:46.144
Couple of orphans.

44:46.979 --> 44:48.939
Dickens would have a field day.

44:49.731 --> 44:51.817
I'm not the type that he writes about.

44:51.900 --> 44:53.277
Oh, why's that?

44:53.360 --> 44:55.821
I have zero redeeming qualities.

44:56.738 --> 44:58.240
Stop playing a type.

44:59.366 --> 45:01.285
What type? What type is that?

45:01.869 --> 45:04.329
A mysterious, self-deprecating,

45:04.413 --> 45:08.000
"Oh, I can't help it,
I have so much money" bad guy.

45:09.334 --> 45:11.753
It's a front. I can tell.

45:11.837 --> 45:13.881
Yeah? How can you tell?

45:13.964 --> 45:18.552
Well, for one, you didn't blow
your whole inheritance on blow.

45:19.386 --> 45:21.847
-Quite the achievement.
-Yeah, you'd be surprised.

45:21.930 --> 45:26.310
And you went out of your way
to apologize to me.

45:27.728 --> 45:28.812
That's redeeming.

45:30.606 --> 45:33.150
I did that
'cause I'm trying to impress you.

45:36.695 --> 45:41.700
Anyway, are you showing me all this
just to torture me, or...

45:42.242 --> 45:44.661
Yes. No, what do you mean?

45:45.412 --> 45:48.290
I just, I can't imagine
what it's like to wake up

45:48.373 --> 45:51.502
and have all this
at your fingertips every single day.

45:52.169 --> 45:54.671
Well, maybe you should imagine it.

45:56.673 --> 45:59.635
When are you going to stop
saying things like that?

46:00.135 --> 46:01.887
When are you going to kiss me?

46:03.472 --> 46:05.849
What makes you think I wanna kiss you?

46:11.396 --> 46:13.982
Well, now it's cliché.

46:16.109 --> 46:18.195
Would you like me to turn them off?

46:53.647 --> 46:54.773
Thank you for coming.

46:55.524 --> 46:56.650
Thank you.

47:00.946 --> 47:03.031
Did your girl turn into a pumpkin?

47:03.699 --> 47:05.742
She's recovering from jet lag.

47:06.326 --> 47:08.328
It looked like you were enjoying
yourself.

47:09.371 --> 47:10.956
She's quite refreshing.

47:12.708 --> 47:14.042
All sparkly and new?

47:15.169 --> 47:16.044
Play nice.

47:16.962 --> 47:18.213
Always.

47:21.383 --> 47:22.384
I mean it.

48:21.026 --> 48:22.277
Evie.

49:11.034 --> 49:13.245
Hey, it's me! It's me, okay?

49:13.328 --> 49:14.872
There's something in here.

49:14.955 --> 49:15.956
-What?
-There.

49:22.921 --> 49:23.797
Where?

49:28.385 --> 49:29.803
There's nothing here.

49:30.679 --> 49:31.680
No, but...

49:32.764 --> 49:33.974
Hey!

49:34.057 --> 49:35.809
Hey, hey, hey!

49:36.685 --> 49:37.811
It's okay.

49:39.062 --> 49:41.398
It's fine, you're safe.
Look at me. Hey.

49:41.899 --> 49:42.983
You're safe.

49:43.567 --> 49:45.611
-Yeah.
-Come here.

50:00.167 --> 50:03.045
You don't have to do that.
I made the mess.

50:03.128 --> 50:06.340
It's my job, miss.
Can't have your room in this state.

50:09.134 --> 50:10.886
Oh, damn it. Sorry.

50:10.969 --> 50:12.054
Never mind that.

50:14.431 --> 50:15.933
I feel like I'm going crazy.

50:17.976 --> 50:21.730
Thank you, Mrs. Swift.
Thank you. I'll see it from here.

50:23.482 --> 50:24.566
Yes, sir.

50:27.819 --> 50:29.071
How are you feeling?

50:30.405 --> 50:32.074
-Like a fool.
-Don't.

50:32.866 --> 50:36.119
Okay? It's a new environment.
It takes time to adjust.

50:40.999 --> 50:44.044
If you like, I could stay with you
till you fall asleep.

50:47.172 --> 50:49.675
Yeah, that would be nice.

50:50.175 --> 50:51.677
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

50:53.595 --> 50:55.180
Do you have a preference?

50:56.181 --> 50:57.099
For what?

50:57.683 --> 51:00.352
Side of the bed.
I've kinda been sprawling...

51:01.144 --> 51:03.730
-just everywhere.
-Yeah, no.

51:03.814 --> 51:05.858
I mean, anywhere. Whatever works.

51:06.859 --> 51:07.901
Okay.

51:09.570 --> 51:10.529
-Let's.
-Okay.

51:22.291 --> 51:23.208
Talk to me.

51:24.251 --> 51:25.836
It'll help me fall asleep.

51:29.381 --> 51:32.467
There is actually something
that I am curious about,

51:34.052 --> 51:36.930
but I don't quite know how to ask it.

51:38.891 --> 51:40.809
Yeah, it's a little forward.

51:41.685 --> 51:45.522
Well, you are lying in my bed, so...

51:47.107 --> 51:50.485
I'm wondering, what is it
that you want with your life?

51:52.696 --> 51:54.489
-We're going there.
-Oh, yeah.

51:54.573 --> 51:56.241
I never mastered small talk.

51:56.783 --> 51:57.910
I've noticed.

51:59.286 --> 52:03.123
Okay, so I'm tempted to say
I wanna be a working artist.

52:03.207 --> 52:05.709
Say something important and all that.

52:05.792 --> 52:09.755
But truthfully,
I've been treading water...

52:10.756 --> 52:12.591
barely scraping by.

52:14.384 --> 52:16.136
I wanna live life fully.

52:17.221 --> 52:19.515
You know? Throw caution to the wind.

52:20.682 --> 52:22.434
That's what I really want.

52:23.435 --> 52:24.436
Great answer.

52:25.229 --> 52:26.438
And what about you?

52:27.856 --> 52:29.191
What do you want for your life?

52:29.816 --> 52:31.318
I think about this quite a lot.

52:31.401 --> 52:32.653
I can tell.

52:32.736 --> 52:36.198
I have a great life, and I know that.
But you know what?

52:37.491 --> 52:41.203
Having all the money in the world,
it means nothing.

52:41.787 --> 52:44.623
You know that's something
only rich people say, right?

52:44.706 --> 52:45.749
I know.

52:47.793 --> 52:48.752
I just...

52:51.338 --> 52:54.633
I want someone to share all this.
Someone to enjoy it with.

52:55.300 --> 53:00.097
I'm tired of the facade
and constantly keeping up appearances.

53:00.180 --> 53:03.058
Yes, it's a grand life...

53:04.768 --> 53:06.144
but it's isolating.

53:10.107 --> 53:13.318
I want someone to see me
for who I truly am.

53:15.112 --> 53:18.699
Doesn't try and change me into an idea
or into a concept.

53:20.534 --> 53:23.245
Or an itch that they need to scratch.

53:26.248 --> 53:28.125
Someone that accepts me.

54:03.160 --> 54:04.578
Hello, sleepy head!

54:05.954 --> 54:07.247
What time is it?

54:07.998 --> 54:10.167
It is time for our spa day.

54:10.751 --> 54:13.629
We've arranged a day of pampering
for ladies of the bridal party.

54:13.712 --> 54:15.339
We heard you had quite the evening.

54:16.590 --> 54:19.176
Oh, yes. Don't worry about that.

54:19.259 --> 54:22.137
Took me a while to get used
to this rickety old place myself.

54:22.930 --> 54:25.766
You can leave that thing here.
There's no service where we're going.

54:30.229 --> 54:31.063
Come on.

54:35.901 --> 54:36.902
All right.

54:37.402 --> 54:38.779
Spa day.

54:54.294 --> 54:56.713
This is Evie.

55:06.849 --> 55:08.392
Sit. Relax.

55:09.309 --> 55:10.853
Hello.

55:14.690 --> 55:17.901
So, I'm excited to finally meet
the bride and groom tonight.

55:17.985 --> 55:21.572
Yes. They really are the perfect match.

55:22.906 --> 55:24.825
Would you like
to get married one day, Evie?

55:24.908 --> 55:27.327
Oh, God. I don't know.

55:27.828 --> 55:29.788
I feel so young.

55:31.707 --> 55:33.709
But what if you met the right person?

55:33.792 --> 55:35.502
Age is but a number.

55:36.170 --> 55:39.256
Maybe one day, but I like my independence.

55:40.132 --> 55:41.049
I see.

55:43.010 --> 55:44.636
Do you have any siblings?

55:45.137 --> 55:47.681
No. One was enough for my parents.

55:47.764 --> 55:50.976
And they probably would've requested
a refund if they could.

55:51.476 --> 55:53.687
No, I very much doubt that.

55:54.980 --> 55:56.982
It was a joke.

55:58.442 --> 56:00.152
Right, of course.

56:00.235 --> 56:02.487
Well, I have older brothers...

56:04.698 --> 56:06.408
but always wanted a sister.

56:07.784 --> 56:09.661
Do leave the poor girl alone, Lucy.

56:09.745 --> 56:11.788
You're like a little Pomeranian.

56:14.917 --> 56:16.877
I always wanted a sister too.

56:20.130 --> 56:23.133
You and Walter seem to be getting
awfully close, Evie.

56:24.092 --> 56:26.220
We're just getting to know one another.

56:26.887 --> 56:28.847
You don't have to play coy with me,
honey.

56:29.389 --> 56:30.599
I'm curious, though.

56:31.850 --> 56:33.977
What has he told you about us?

56:35.562 --> 56:36.605
Nothing much.

56:37.397 --> 56:40.359
But I'm sure he will tell me
if there is something worth telling.

56:43.570 --> 56:45.656
I'm sure he'll fill you in
at the right time.

56:47.366 --> 56:50.619
How well can you really know someone
if you don't know their past, though?

56:51.119 --> 56:54.122
I think you should take people
as they are. You know?

56:54.206 --> 56:56.875
People change.
No point digging up skeletons.

56:58.126 --> 57:00.295
I call bullshit.

57:00.379 --> 57:02.256
Nobody has that much virtue.

57:02.965 --> 57:07.678
Given the opportunity, we'd all snoop.
Read their diaries, texts, emails.

57:09.054 --> 57:11.139
We can't help it. It's in our nature.

57:11.223 --> 57:15.018
I guess we'll just have
to agree to disagree.

57:16.144 --> 57:19.523
So, you're not even a teeny bit curious
what he gets up to

57:19.606 --> 57:21.149
behind those locked doors?

57:21.233 --> 57:22.901
What is your problem?

57:24.194 --> 57:25.195
I'm sorry, miss.

57:25.279 --> 57:28.365
-I'm so sorry!
-No, it's okay. Honestly.

57:29.700 --> 57:31.201
Oh, Evie. You're bleeding.

57:31.285 --> 57:33.704
-I'm fine. It's nothing.
-You poor thing.

57:35.122 --> 57:36.248
Let me see.

57:38.500 --> 57:39.543
What the fuck?

57:40.919 --> 57:42.254
Oh, my God.

57:42.337 --> 57:43.630
Hey, Evie, I'll come with you.

57:43.714 --> 57:45.382
It's okay. I'll see you later.

57:45.465 --> 57:47.968
Just teasing you, baby doll.
Lighten up.

57:48.969 --> 57:50.470
You'll learn to love me.

57:51.263 --> 57:52.431
Promise.

58:48.362 --> 58:49.363
Shit!

59:21.436 --> 59:22.396
Evie?

59:23.188 --> 59:24.273
You okay?

59:24.356 --> 59:25.190
I'm leaving.

59:26.984 --> 59:28.485
Why? Did Viktoria say something?

59:28.569 --> 59:30.696
I do not care about Viktoria.

59:34.658 --> 59:36.660
Okay, look. I can explain this.

59:36.743 --> 59:39.955
-What? That you were stalking me?
-That's a bit of a stretch.

59:40.038 --> 59:42.291
You have a file on your desk
with my name on it, Walt.

59:42.374 --> 59:45.002
-If you let me explain...
-I knew this was too good to be true.

59:45.085 --> 59:46.795
-And here's the evidence.
-Evidence?

59:46.879 --> 59:50.340
You said you wanted to get to know me,
but it's all here in black and white.

59:50.424 --> 59:53.510
My mom's name, where I grew up,
my school. You knew everything.

59:53.594 --> 59:55.262
Let's just not jump to conclusions.

59:55.345 --> 59:57.431
And tell me, do you vet everyone
who comes here...

59:57.514 --> 59:59.725
or is that a privilege reserved for
people like me?

59:59.808 --> 1:00:01.310
That has nothing to do with it.

1:00:01.393 --> 1:00:03.562
Smart thinking getting
my criminal record checked.

1:00:03.645 --> 1:00:07.107
And by the way, I had my tonsils removed
when I was 13 years old...

1:00:07.191 --> 1:00:09.318
so you might wanna add that
to your little dossier.

1:00:09.401 --> 1:00:11.403
-You're being obstinate.
-You're being arrogant.

1:00:11.486 --> 1:00:13.780
You don't know what it's like
to have people use you

1:00:13.864 --> 1:00:15.699
and take advantage of you all the time.

1:00:15.782 --> 1:00:17.826
Really? I don't know what that's like?

1:00:18.869 --> 1:00:22.164
I wanted to know a few things about you
before I let you sleep under my roof.

1:00:22.247 --> 1:00:23.999
Would you not have done the same?

1:00:28.212 --> 1:00:31.590
When Oliver asked if he could invite
his long-lost cousin to the wedding,

1:00:31.673 --> 1:00:34.760
I asked if he could send
some information over on you

1:00:34.843 --> 1:00:37.679
to make sure that you weren't
an opportunist.

1:00:38.263 --> 1:00:39.932
It wouldn't be the first time.

1:00:40.015 --> 1:00:42.226
And yes, I despise technology,
and he knows that,

1:00:42.309 --> 1:00:44.520
so he printed out a few pages for me.

1:00:44.603 --> 1:00:46.605
And that is the extent of it.

1:00:46.688 --> 1:00:48.482
I do want to get to know you.

1:00:49.024 --> 1:00:51.818
The real you. Not some bullet points
on a piece of paper.

1:00:53.403 --> 1:00:56.156
And yes, I would be lying
if I said I wasn't...

1:00:57.199 --> 1:00:58.700
intrigued by what I saw.

1:01:00.953 --> 1:01:02.246
I am guilty of that.

1:01:08.001 --> 1:01:09.670
You should've just asked me.

1:01:10.337 --> 1:01:12.339
I know, and I'm sorry.

1:01:12.923 --> 1:01:14.341
And I made a mistake.

1:01:15.259 --> 1:01:16.343
It's just...

1:01:17.469 --> 1:01:19.304
I'm not used to this.

1:01:19.388 --> 1:01:21.640
And I wasn't expecting you to be you.

1:01:23.725 --> 1:01:25.352
I didn't expect you either.

1:01:31.233 --> 1:01:34.361
-Did we just have our first fight?
-Don't be charming.

1:01:35.779 --> 1:01:38.282
Do you think you're the only one scared
of getting hurt?

1:01:38.365 --> 1:01:41.118
-Please. Nothing frightens you.
-Oh, yeah?

1:01:41.869 --> 1:01:44.913
When I saw you packing your things,
that scared me.

1:01:48.500 --> 1:01:50.002
Please don't run away.

1:01:52.462 --> 1:01:53.589
Okay.

1:01:56.592 --> 1:01:57.718
No more secrets.

1:02:59.988 --> 1:03:02.366
We should get ready
for the rehearsal dinner.

1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:04.743
It's that time already?

1:03:05.452 --> 1:03:06.870
I'm afraid so.

1:03:09.122 --> 1:03:13.460
Well, I can't wait to see
the wedding of the century.

1:03:15.087 --> 1:03:16.964
We should make it a double wedding.

1:03:19.174 --> 1:03:20.300
Very funny.

1:03:20.384 --> 1:03:21.510
Why not?

1:03:22.344 --> 1:03:24.429
Why not have a shotgun wedding?

1:03:24.930 --> 1:03:26.098
-Yeah.
-Oh, God.

1:03:26.181 --> 1:03:29.101
I mean, our families are here.

1:03:29.184 --> 1:03:31.228
All the arrangements have been made.

1:03:31.895 --> 1:03:33.564
You are high on sex.

1:03:33.647 --> 1:03:36.900
We should live in the moment.
Throw caution to the wind.

1:03:38.235 --> 1:03:39.653
Okay, fine. I accept.

1:03:55.169 --> 1:03:59.047
I have left you a dress in the wardrobe.
In case you need something to wear.

1:04:00.174 --> 1:04:01.550
More gifts?

1:04:10.601 --> 1:04:11.852
Walt.

1:04:12.436 --> 1:04:14.229
You know I was joking, right?

1:04:54.394 --> 1:04:55.729
There she is!

1:05:06.823 --> 1:05:07.991
Darling, please, sit down.

1:05:08.075 --> 1:05:09.743
The festivities are about to start.

1:05:10.536 --> 1:05:11.453
Okay.

1:05:14.122 --> 1:05:16.667
Someone surely does look the part.

1:05:18.168 --> 1:05:19.795
My dear friends,

1:05:19.878 --> 1:05:21.004
my comrades...

1:05:21.713 --> 1:05:25.968
I would like to formally welcome
the three great families to New Carfax.

1:05:26.635 --> 1:05:28.387
The Billingtons of Whitby.

1:05:29.721 --> 1:05:32.307
Klopstocks, Budapest.

1:05:33.267 --> 1:05:36.520
And the Alexanders of London.

1:05:38.939 --> 1:05:41.316
-Let the feast begin.
-Hear, hear!

1:05:46.822 --> 1:05:49.992
You are a vision.

1:05:51.618 --> 1:05:53.662
So, that was intense.

1:05:53.745 --> 1:05:55.998
You know the English and their traditions.

1:05:58.625 --> 1:06:02.212
I'm so glad that we can finally
be honest with each other.

1:06:03.839 --> 1:06:04.965
Me too.

1:06:06.175 --> 1:06:08.468
So, where are the bride and groom?

1:06:20.355 --> 1:06:23.066
If you'll all indulge me
for one more moment.

1:06:27.321 --> 1:06:30.949
Our four families
have served each other for generations.

1:06:31.950 --> 1:06:33.160
But as you all know,

1:06:33.243 --> 1:06:36.246
there has been
someone missing from this table,

1:06:36.330 --> 1:06:39.041
someone vital to our alliance.

1:06:39.666 --> 1:06:42.586
And we've all felt
the strain of this imbalance.

1:06:43.545 --> 1:06:47.841
But tonight,
that once broken bond will be renewed,

1:06:47.925 --> 1:06:49.468
refortified...

1:06:54.973 --> 1:06:57.726
when Evelyn Alexander and I are wed.

1:06:57.809 --> 1:06:58.852
Congratulations!

1:07:02.773 --> 1:07:04.566
What are you doing? Walt!

1:07:07.819 --> 1:07:08.779
Refreshments, please.

1:07:08.862 --> 1:07:10.656
Walt! Walt!

1:07:14.660 --> 1:07:17.287
Oh, finally!
I was getting obscenely bored.

1:08:04.793 --> 1:08:05.794
Okay.

1:08:22.185 --> 1:08:23.312
My lord.

1:08:25.479 --> 1:08:27.524
For as long as I care to remember,

1:08:27.608 --> 1:08:31.778
you lovely mortals
have provided me with the gift of wives.

1:08:32.279 --> 1:08:33.363
Three brides.

1:08:33.947 --> 1:08:36.742
Three. The magic number.

1:08:36.825 --> 1:08:37.951
And in return,

1:08:38.035 --> 1:08:43.332
you and your families enjoyed
safety and prosperity for generations.

1:08:43.999 --> 1:08:47.377
We are at our strongest
when there are three.

1:08:47.461 --> 1:08:51.256
We can thrive when there are three.

1:08:51.340 --> 1:08:55.511
When Emmaline,
my Alexander bride, chose to leave us,

1:08:55.594 --> 1:08:59.305
our union was compromised.
Emmaline, my Alexander bride.

1:08:59.389 --> 1:09:01.725
In 1925, your great-grandmother,
Emmaline...

1:09:01.808 --> 1:09:03.060
Your great-grandmother...

1:09:03.143 --> 1:09:04.269
Who's that?

1:09:04.353 --> 1:09:06.270
Former lady of the house.

1:09:06.354 --> 1:09:08.064
She passed away recently.

1:09:10.274 --> 1:09:14.904
Tonight, we celebrate our eternal bond,

1:09:14.988 --> 1:09:18.951
the pact that your ancestors made
many, many moons ago.

1:09:20.202 --> 1:09:21.537
Charge your glasses.

1:09:23.830 --> 1:09:24.957
To Evie.

1:09:26.416 --> 1:09:28.252
-My new bride.
-To Evie.

1:09:29.002 --> 1:09:33.048
You have brought new life
to these four walls.

1:09:34.258 --> 1:09:37.135
Maybe even enough
to make this old heart beat again.

1:09:38.011 --> 1:09:40.889
May the bridemaidens rejoice!

1:09:40.973 --> 1:09:43.350
The bridemaidens rejoice!

1:09:48.020 --> 1:09:50.357
I believe congratulations are in order,
dear cousin.

1:09:50.439 --> 1:09:53.402
I have to go. I have to...

1:10:03.328 --> 1:10:05.414
Please. Let me go.

1:10:06.540 --> 1:10:08.125
I'm begging you, please.

1:10:08.208 --> 1:10:09.376
Evie.

1:10:11.670 --> 1:10:13.338
My love, whatever is the matter?

1:10:19.720 --> 1:10:21.263
I want to go home.

1:10:22.556 --> 1:10:24.558
But this is your home.

1:10:25.350 --> 1:10:27.394
We are your family.

1:10:29.271 --> 1:10:33.775
Evie, I thought we agreed
that we were done with the charade.

1:10:35.569 --> 1:10:36.778
Secrets.

1:10:38.530 --> 1:10:42.201
We are now free to be our true selves. No?

1:10:43.660 --> 1:10:45.913
Why are you all just sitting there?

1:10:46.580 --> 1:10:49.333
Do something! Help me!

1:10:51.710 --> 1:10:54.421
-You're all monsters! All of you!
-Miss!

1:10:54.505 --> 1:10:55.422
You're sick!

1:10:57.174 --> 1:11:00.802
Don't take her words to heart.
You know how difficult brides can be.

1:11:02.012 --> 1:11:03.013
Help!

1:11:04.097 --> 1:11:05.599
Help me!

1:11:09.019 --> 1:11:10.729
You're embarrassing me.

1:11:14.191 --> 1:11:15.275
Hey, it's me.

1:11:16.902 --> 1:11:17.861
No.

1:11:23.909 --> 1:11:24.868
Get her prepared.

1:11:24.952 --> 1:11:26.620
Tonight is yours.

1:11:27.329 --> 1:11:28.497
Tomorrow is mine.

1:11:28.580 --> 1:11:30.374
Welcome our new bride to the family.

1:11:32.042 --> 1:11:33.460
Eat. Come on, eat.

1:12:11.039 --> 1:12:13.709
Welcome to your bachelorette party, Evie.

1:12:13.792 --> 1:12:17.087
Hey, no, no, no. Don't cry.

1:12:17.171 --> 1:12:21.884
We'll soon be just like sisters.
Three perfect little dolls for the master.

1:12:21.967 --> 1:12:23.385
Please let me go.

1:12:23.468 --> 1:12:24.386
Enough already.

1:12:24.469 --> 1:12:26.805
Even your great-grandmother
wasn't this difficult...

1:12:27.389 --> 1:12:29.224
till she refused to feed on the help.

1:12:29.308 --> 1:12:31.226
Truly selfish act.

1:12:31.768 --> 1:12:33.395
She put us all in jeopardy.

1:12:33.478 --> 1:12:34.897
Emmaline was lovely.

1:12:34.980 --> 1:12:38.984
And we were such great friends.
She just... Well, she became confused.

1:12:39.568 --> 1:12:43.989
But you, you won't let us down
like she did, now, will you, Evie?

1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:49.494
That thing, in my room, that was you?

1:12:49.995 --> 1:12:52.581
Apologies. I was in a playful mood.

1:12:53.957 --> 1:12:57.211
Why? Why are you doing this to me?

1:12:57.711 --> 1:12:59.129
For your blood, of course.

1:12:59.630 --> 1:13:02.591
Our bloodlines are rare. They're special.

1:13:02.674 --> 1:13:07.638
And the combination of them
makes the four of us all-powerful.

1:13:07.721 --> 1:13:09.556
Immune to the effects of time.

1:13:10.057 --> 1:13:14.478
Look, we were both once in the
exact same position as you are, Evie.

1:13:14.561 --> 1:13:17.689
Though choices were limited
for women back then.

1:13:17.773 --> 1:13:20.692
Viktoria has been with him for 500 years.

1:13:20.776 --> 1:13:22.194
Me, only a hundred.

1:13:22.694 --> 1:13:25.781
At the ceremony,
you'll be bound to the master.

1:13:25.864 --> 1:13:27.407
And to us.

1:13:27.491 --> 1:13:31.161
But in order to make the bond permanent,
you must first consume his blood.

1:13:31.245 --> 1:13:33.330
When you drink, you will absorb his power.

1:13:33.413 --> 1:13:35.499
You will gain the strength
of a hundred men.

1:13:35.582 --> 1:13:37.793
But only after
the master drinks your blood

1:13:37.876 --> 1:13:40.754
will we all be granted eternal life.

1:13:40.838 --> 1:13:44.216
You'll enjoy your powers
for as long as he lives.

1:13:50.055 --> 1:13:51.306
No.

1:13:51.390 --> 1:13:53.141
No, no, no.

1:13:57.104 --> 1:13:59.481
No, don't! Don't.

1:13:59.982 --> 1:14:01.608
You like this one?

1:14:04.987 --> 1:14:05.904
Dee.

1:14:08.699 --> 1:14:11.994
Clean this one up.
Hold it for the ceremony.

1:14:12.077 --> 1:14:14.663
The new mistress has taken a shine to it.

1:14:16.790 --> 1:14:19.710
Look, Evie! Your new home.

1:14:21.461 --> 1:14:24.631
-Please don't put me in there.
-No, no, no. Don't worry.

1:14:24.715 --> 1:14:27.009
You can still be outside during the day.

1:14:27.092 --> 1:14:30.095
There are so many
misconceptions about our kind.

1:14:36.852 --> 1:14:37.728
Please.

1:14:37.811 --> 1:14:41.106
-Say good night!
-Help! No! No, stop!

1:14:41.190 --> 1:14:42.316
Help!

1:14:43.066 --> 1:14:44.860
Help! No!

1:14:44.943 --> 1:14:45.861
No!

1:14:50.616 --> 1:14:54.077
Stop! Please, no! Let me out!

1:14:54.703 --> 1:14:56.371
No, don't leave me in here!

1:14:59.166 --> 1:15:00.417
No!

1:15:03.837 --> 1:15:04.922
No!

1:15:05.631 --> 1:15:07.216
No! Help!

1:15:12.429 --> 1:15:13.305
Help!

1:15:34.326 --> 1:15:35.410
Shit.

1:15:58.100 --> 1:15:59.226
Quickly, now.

1:16:01.895 --> 1:16:03.272
You have to be quiet.

1:16:03.355 --> 1:16:07.067
-Wait. Diya.
-You'll have to send help.

1:16:07.150 --> 1:16:09.194
Why are you helping me?

1:16:09.278 --> 1:16:11.446
Your great-grandmother was a dear friend.

1:16:12.447 --> 1:16:15.117
She held out as long as she could
for everyone's sake.

1:16:15.617 --> 1:16:18.871
But in the end, being married to a monster
was too much to bear.

1:16:20.789 --> 1:16:21.832
Move quickly.

1:16:21.915 --> 1:16:25.961
If you see one, a stake, beheading,
or fire are the only ways to kill them.

1:16:26.044 --> 1:16:29.131
And don't stop running
till you're on a plane out of England.

1:16:29.214 --> 1:16:30.924
What will happen to you?

1:16:31.925 --> 1:16:33.427
I'll get what I deserve.

1:16:34.970 --> 1:16:35.804
Go!

1:16:35.888 --> 1:16:37.055
Go, go!

1:17:25.103 --> 1:17:27.064
-You men, over there!
-Right!

1:18:11.984 --> 1:18:13.443
Scour the grounds.

1:18:14.778 --> 1:18:16.572
-She won't get far.
-Sir.

1:18:58.197 --> 1:19:00.574
We will hunt you down!

1:19:44.535 --> 1:19:45.953
Help me.

1:19:46.036 --> 1:19:47.371
Help me, please!

1:19:47.454 --> 1:19:49.748
I'm sorry. We don't have any money.

1:19:49.831 --> 1:19:50.916
Please.

1:19:50.999 --> 1:19:53.794
They're coming for me. Please. De Ville.

1:19:56.129 --> 1:19:58.841
Jonathan, there's a girl out here.

1:20:15.190 --> 1:20:16.233
Here, dear.

1:20:18.068 --> 1:20:19.570
You're shaking.

1:20:20.946 --> 1:20:23.866
Chamomile. Soothes the soul.

1:20:24.825 --> 1:20:28.245
Yes, hello, Mr. Harker here.

1:20:28.328 --> 1:20:32.541
Yeah, there's a young lady here
who seems quite distressed.

1:20:33.584 --> 1:20:34.835
Yes.

1:20:37.171 --> 1:20:39.882
I can't quite hear them, dear.
Could you try?

1:20:42.843 --> 1:20:44.928
Hello, this is Mina Harker.

1:20:46.972 --> 1:20:52.811
Yeah, well, the girl says she, well,
escaped from New Carfax.

1:20:55.564 --> 1:20:58.358
Well, I know,
it's terribly alarming, yeah.

1:21:01.278 --> 1:21:02.571
Oh, yes, I know.

1:21:04.239 --> 1:21:06.742
I've just made her a cup of tea.

1:21:10.412 --> 1:21:14.708
Have a sip, my dear.
It's good for the nerves.

1:21:15.959 --> 1:21:17.211
Yes, of course.

1:21:17.294 --> 1:21:19.713
Oh, it's our honor, really.

1:21:24.218 --> 1:21:25.469
They're on their way.

1:21:30.641 --> 1:21:33.227
You really should drink your tea.

1:21:50.035 --> 1:21:52.913
Don't fuck this up for all of us, my dear.

1:22:43.714 --> 1:22:46.341
It was a gallant attempt.
I'll give you that.

1:22:50.596 --> 1:22:53.265
I trust you have it
out of your system now.

1:22:54.683 --> 1:22:55.642
Who are you?

1:23:09.156 --> 1:23:15.120
In the old country, they called my kind
strigoi or nosferatu.

1:23:15.913 --> 1:23:20.792
And in Wallachia, they called me
Son of the Dragon.

1:23:21.543 --> 1:23:23.879
A sobriquet I rather enjoy.

1:23:25.464 --> 1:23:27.174
Are you telling me you're...?

1:23:32.262 --> 1:23:36.683
Evie, Evie, Evie,
think about what you're gaining here.

1:23:38.602 --> 1:23:43.857
Wealth, power, great strength,
life eternal.

1:23:43.941 --> 1:23:46.068
No more sickness like your mother had.

1:23:46.151 --> 1:23:51.448
No struggle. No longer confined
by the frailty of human existence.

1:23:51.532 --> 1:23:53.534
A life of privilege.

1:23:56.286 --> 1:24:01.416
A sense of belonging
and a family entirely dedicated to you.

1:24:01.500 --> 1:24:03.210
Isn't that why you came here?

1:24:04.545 --> 1:24:06.213
Isn't that what you want?

1:24:10.175 --> 1:24:17.182
For someone of your background,
surely this is more than a leg up.

1:24:34.867 --> 1:24:41.665
It would make your life so much easier
if you came willingly.

1:24:48.213 --> 1:24:53.802
Regardless, you have no say in the matter.
You already agreed to my proposal.

1:24:54.511 --> 1:24:55.888
You tricked me.

1:24:55.971 --> 1:24:58.974
Fortunately for me,
the fine print's irrelevant.

1:25:08.692 --> 1:25:09.735
Excuse me.

1:25:18.243 --> 1:25:19.536
Well.

1:25:34.134 --> 1:25:36.887
The fibula is so underrated
in my opinion.

1:27:17.029 --> 1:27:18.155
Stop smiling.

1:27:43.013 --> 1:27:46.308
I'm so glad you've come
to your senses, my love.

1:27:46.892 --> 1:27:50.145
We are gathered here this evening

1:27:50.229 --> 1:27:56.026
to sanctify the union between
our benevolent master and his new bride

1:27:56.652 --> 1:27:58.695
from the Alexander bloodline.

1:28:00.072 --> 1:28:02.199
Long may they flourish.

1:28:02.282 --> 1:28:05.285
May the bridemaidens rejoice!

1:28:06.453 --> 1:28:07.621
Master.

1:28:09.248 --> 1:28:11.625
Do you take this woman to be your bride?

1:28:14.169 --> 1:28:15.295
I do.

1:28:16.338 --> 1:28:23.345
And do you, Evelyn Alexander,
take the master to love, honor,

1:28:23.428 --> 1:28:27.140
serve, and obey
for all the days of your eternal life?

1:28:39.194 --> 1:28:41.280
It all ends here

1:28:42.990 --> 1:28:44.199
with me.

1:28:45.158 --> 1:28:49.371
Know that when things are hard,
you're stronger than you think you are.

1:28:49.454 --> 1:28:51.498
You will absorb his power.

1:28:57.254 --> 1:28:58.088
Yes.

1:29:01.341 --> 1:29:03.719
May you now exchange blood.

1:29:32.039 --> 1:29:33.957
Slow down, dear.

1:29:34.041 --> 1:29:36.043
There's plenty more to come.

1:30:56.373 --> 1:30:58.000
I want her next.

1:31:23.066 --> 1:31:26.653
No! No! No, no. No.

1:31:38.081 --> 1:31:39.750
Evie, please, I mean...

1:31:46.173 --> 1:31:47.174
No!

1:32:36.640 --> 1:32:41.728
You think you can change
thousands of years just like that?

1:32:41.812 --> 1:32:46.024
-I've killed him. It's over.
-You silly girl.

1:32:46.567 --> 1:32:48.193
It was just a flesh wound.

1:32:48.861 --> 1:32:52.406
If he were dead,
I wouldn't be able to do this.

1:33:05.627 --> 1:33:07.129
No! Diya, go get help!

1:33:11.633 --> 1:33:13.218
You're pathetic.

1:33:13.302 --> 1:33:16.763
You're not one of us. You're a halfling.

1:33:18.307 --> 1:33:19.558
That all you got?

1:33:21.935 --> 1:33:23.478
You're nothing.

1:33:35.616 --> 1:33:37.451
What do you think you're doing?

1:33:38.076 --> 1:33:40.913
It's enough, Viktoria, please.

1:33:40.996 --> 1:33:42.915
You get back in line.

1:33:43.874 --> 1:33:44.875
No.

1:33:44.958 --> 1:33:45.876
No?

1:33:48.045 --> 1:33:51.965
No. You don't tell me what to do anymore.

1:35:20.053 --> 1:35:23.932
I told Master that you were subpar
the moment he mentioned you.

1:35:24.016 --> 1:35:29.062
That you were so beneath our standards.

1:35:30.314 --> 1:35:33.317
I should have slit that baby's throat,
your grandfather...

1:35:33.400 --> 1:35:35.068
when I had the chance.

1:35:36.278 --> 1:35:37.905
I am gonna enjoy...

1:35:37.988 --> 1:35:43.327
cutting your head off
and feeding it to the fucking wolves!

1:35:58.884 --> 1:36:00.052
Asshole.

1:36:51.144 --> 1:36:53.814
I was doing you a favor.

1:36:53.897 --> 1:36:58.151
Saving you from your miserable excuse
for an existence.

1:36:58.235 --> 1:37:00.362
Giving you a family...

1:37:00.445 --> 1:37:02.072
status, privilege...

1:37:02.155 --> 1:37:04.867
all the power in the world.

1:37:04.950 --> 1:37:08.120
I would rather die than be a part of this.

1:37:08.829 --> 1:37:12.165
You modern women are so ungrateful.

1:37:14.084 --> 1:37:15.711
All those women.

1:37:15.794 --> 1:37:16.879
You're a monster.

1:37:16.962 --> 1:37:19.006
I am a god!

1:37:20.382 --> 1:37:22.926
I hope you all burn.

1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:39.735
You...

1:39:09.867 --> 1:39:11.451
Hey. It's me.

1:39:11.535 --> 1:39:14.162
We've paid off the cops.
It's bought us some time.

1:39:14.246 --> 1:39:17.249
We have to destroy the evidence
and get the fuck out of town.

1:39:18.458 --> 1:39:20.294
Don't worry, she's mortal.

1:39:22.254 --> 1:39:23.922
She doesn't have any powers.

1:39:26.383 --> 1:39:29.344
All right. All right.
I'll get back to you.

1:39:32.514 --> 1:39:34.892
Still the whitest man I've ever seen.

1:39:36.185 --> 1:39:39.104
I gotta say,
I'm loving this whole look on you.

1:39:39.188 --> 1:39:40.772
Well, thank you.

1:39:41.607 --> 1:39:43.192
Out with the old, in with the new.

1:39:46.570 --> 1:39:47.738
You know the plan?

1:39:47.821 --> 1:39:50.157
Yep. We go in there
and take him the F out.

1:39:50.240 --> 1:39:52.659
Exactly, but let me take the lead.

1:39:53.744 --> 1:39:55.746
Don't wanna be relegated to the sidekick?

1:39:55.829 --> 1:39:58.999
Please. I have always been your sidekick.

1:40:03.295 --> 1:40:04.630
All right, sis...

1:40:04.713 --> 1:40:05.714
you ready?

1:40:06.548 --> 1:40:08.008
For you?

1:40:08.091 --> 1:40:09.134
Always.

1:40:17.059 --> 1:40:19.144
Wait. Where did you get a bat?

1:40:19.228 --> 1:40:20.562
It's ironic, right?

1:40:20.646 --> 1:40:22.773
Bat, vampire.

1:40:22.856 --> 1:40:24.358
Come on, E. That's good.
