01:53.447 --> 01:54.949
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

02:56.927 --> 02:59.471
Mr. Doria?
Virginia Goodman.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.183
I was sent by your lawyer, Félix Leiva.

03:03.976 --> 03:04.977
A pleasure.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.189
- Come in.
- Thanks.

03:11.192 --> 03:14.195
- Give me two minutes to get dressed.
- Sure.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.826
...by members of armed groups
that have demobilized

03:20.993 --> 03:23.871
and are contributing
to the search for the missing.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.625
In national news,
the main news this morning

03:27.791 --> 03:30.461
is the funeral held in memory
of Laura Vidal,

03:30.628 --> 03:33.005
the renowned photographer
and visual artist,

03:33.172 --> 03:36.008
allegedly murdered by
her lover, Adrián Doria,

03:36.175 --> 03:38.302
recently awarded in the prestigious

03:38.469 --> 03:41.305
European Awards for Innovation
and Business Development

03:41.472 --> 03:43.182
as businessman of the year.

03:43.349 --> 03:45.935
Doria, who recently made inroads
into the Asian market

03:46.101 --> 03:47.686
with his company
Global Go Tech Media,

03:47.853 --> 03:51.690
is pleading innocent and states
he is the victim of a plot.

03:53.234 --> 03:55.110
I was expecting you later.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.529
Yes. We've had a setback.

03:57.696 --> 04:00.241
I tried to talk to Félix,
but his phone's off.

04:00.407 --> 04:01.200
He's out of town.

04:01.367 --> 04:05.621
But he said everything was
under control, that he had a lead...

04:05.788 --> 04:07.414
- That would change everything, yes.
- Exactly.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.458
That's what he said
when I last spoke to him.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.962
But I didn't know then what I do now,
and what he still doesn't know.

04:13.128 --> 04:13.921
What?

04:14.088 --> 04:16.507
It's very likely you'll be
called to testify tonight.

04:16.673 --> 04:17.423
What?

04:17.591 --> 04:21.553
One of my courthouse sources says
the prosecutor has a last-minute witness

04:21.720 --> 04:23.973
who could turn your case around.

04:24.139 --> 04:27.142
We don't know who it is yet,
but they're being taken to the court

04:27.309 --> 04:29.728
to testify in three hours.

04:29.895 --> 04:30.896
I told the truth.

04:31.689 --> 04:35.359
Your testimony has holes,
and I need details.

04:37.236 --> 04:39.446
Plausibility is based on details.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.533
I can use them to convince
the world that you're innocent.

04:43.742 --> 04:45.286
I assure you, I can do it.

04:45.577 --> 04:49.373
So far I've never lost
a case before any judge.

04:50.165 --> 04:51.959
But I need you to cooperate.

04:52.668 --> 04:56.255
The police have turned this place
into a cell, I'm watched 24 hours a day.

04:57.131 --> 05:00.384
Don't you think if had anything to add
I would've done it by now?

05:00.551 --> 05:03.679
They're going to request
your immediate arrest, Mr. Doria.

05:03.846 --> 05:06.432
We have 180 minutes to start over,

05:06.598 --> 05:10.227
so I advise you to stop whining
and let's get to work.

05:20.195 --> 05:22.865
Right, let's go back to the start.

05:23.365 --> 05:25.200
What were you and the deceased
doing at that hotel?

05:36.045 --> 05:37.421
We were told to go there.

05:40.257 --> 05:43.010
We'd been seeing each other
for a few months.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.430
Someone was trying to blackmail us.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.849
We were following their instructions.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.269
They wanted 100,000 Euros.

05:52.436 --> 05:55.564
It's better to buy someone's silence
than face a million-dollar divorce.

05:55.731 --> 05:58.150
I never wanted to divorce Sonia,
I love her.

05:58.317 --> 06:01.236
Why that hotel, 200 miles away
from your lives?

06:01.403 --> 06:02.279
I don't know.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.616
Weren't you surprised they chose
somewhere so out of the way?

06:05.783 --> 06:07.326
Who cares which hotel it was?

06:07.493 --> 06:09.161
Had you and your lover
been there before?

06:09.328 --> 06:11.663
The problem here is someone
pinned a murder on me.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.666
Everything is important, Mr. Doria.

06:16.502 --> 06:17.878
But it's alright,

06:18.629 --> 06:21.965
first let's talk about
the message on your phone.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.347
We'd been waiting
for two hours when it came.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.742
Something wrong?

06:54.123 --> 06:55.374
He has your cell phone.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.919
He just sent a message
from your cell phone.

06:59.628 --> 07:02.548
I'LL TELL EVERYTHING
ROOM 715, HOTEL BELLAVISTA

07:02.881 --> 07:04.258
It's a trap.

07:04.925 --> 07:05.926
Let's go.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.079
Adrián?

07:38.041 --> 07:39.918
I was unconscious for a few minutes.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.380
And when I woke up...

07:43.547 --> 07:45.215
the nightmare began.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.054
What's the first thing you remember?

07:51.638 --> 07:53.223
Banging on the door.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.684
Police!

07:57.853 --> 07:58.896
Are you alright?

08:23.879 --> 08:25.506
Police!

08:26.089 --> 08:27.174
Open the door.

08:37.518 --> 08:38.936
Out of the way.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.188
Laura!

08:46.026 --> 08:47.110
Do you hear me?

08:47.778 --> 08:48.820
Laura!

08:49.321 --> 08:52.032
We know you're in there!
Open the door!

08:52.199 --> 08:53.784
No, no.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.079
Laura! Help!

08:57.496 --> 08:58.872
Help, please!

08:59.164 --> 08:59.998
Police!

09:01.416 --> 09:02.501
Help!

09:04.545 --> 09:05.712
Get up!

09:06.338 --> 09:08.215
Hands up! Get up!

09:09.800 --> 09:11.468
There was someone in the room.

09:11.635 --> 09:12.844
Hands where I can see them.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.930
I didn't do anything.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.057
Hands up!

09:18.267 --> 09:19.977
- I didn't do anything.
- Get down!

09:20.143 --> 09:22.604
- There was someone else here.
- On the floor!

09:22.771 --> 09:24.147
Don't resist.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.816
Everybody out!

09:47.963 --> 09:50.549
The police report says that

09:50.716 --> 09:54.511
witnesses heard screams,
but didn't see anyone leave the room...

09:54.678 --> 09:56.471
So you didn't see anyone
leave the room.

09:56.638 --> 10:00.350
Which was locked from inside
by a chain.

10:01.184 --> 10:05.022
The report also said that no window
could be opened from the inside

10:05.188 --> 10:08.525
because in the cold months
the hotel removes the handles,

10:08.692 --> 10:10.861
and they hadn't been forced.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.449
They checked every way to get out
without being seen,

10:15.616 --> 10:17.909
but it was impossible
without leaving traces.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.996
And they didn't find any.

10:21.663 --> 10:23.582
So, according to your version,

10:23.749 --> 10:27.753
-your lover's murderer evaporated.
- That's right.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.547
- Before he got out, he had to get in.
- He was there when we arrived.

10:30.714 --> 10:32.924
But he had to get in somehow.

10:33.091 --> 10:34.509
And the hotel staff said

10:34.676 --> 10:37.179
only you had access to the key.

10:37.346 --> 10:40.390
The whole crime scene
was set up to frame me

10:40.724 --> 10:44.186
and give the police the false theory
that Laura fell in love with me

10:44.353 --> 10:45.812
and to protect my marriage

10:45.979 --> 10:48.315
I tried in vain to buy her off.
So I killed her.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.403
- But it's absurd, a trap...
- Whose trap?

10:53.570 --> 10:55.030
- I don't know.
- Why?

10:55.238 --> 10:56.198
I'm telling you I don't know!

10:56.365 --> 10:59.660
I just know my wife's left me
and taken my daughter.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.328
And someone's getting away with it.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.330
Unless you pay attention

11:03.705 --> 11:06.792
and look for answers in the details
of your life, you know what?

11:06.958 --> 11:08.919
- What?
- You're saying the police are right.

11:09.086 --> 11:11.672
They say that nobody
had a motive

11:11.838 --> 11:14.591
to destroy you like this,
so your version

11:14.758 --> 11:17.511
sounds like make believe, Mr. Doria.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.096
It's not my job to find the culprit.

11:19.262 --> 11:19.930
No.

11:20.097 --> 11:22.474
It's Felix's job and yours,
and the police, of course.

11:22.641 --> 11:24.476
They're meant to catch
the culprits, not me.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.311
You are their culprit.

11:29.815 --> 11:32.984
Mr. Doria, if you were me

11:33.151 --> 11:35.987
and I told you about this secret plot,
what would you think?

11:36.154 --> 11:39.199
I'm telling you what happened,
I don't know what else you expect.

11:39.700 --> 11:40.742
Do you know what?

11:43.662 --> 11:47.708
In my 30-year career
I've met two types of clients.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.669
Those who accept their situation
and cooperate,

11:50.836 --> 11:53.046
even if it means going
where they don't want to go,

11:53.213 --> 11:55.257
and those that think
they're smarter than I am

11:55.424 --> 11:58.427
and want me to get them off
without getting dirty.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.513
You're the second type.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.807
But let me be clear on this:

12:11.773 --> 12:14.484
There'll be no salvation without suffering,

12:14.651 --> 12:16.695
and you're not smarter than I am.

12:24.953 --> 12:27.914
YOUNG MAN DISAPPEARS IN BIERGE

12:30.083 --> 12:33.712
Have you wondered what would happen
if the state's witness is involved?

12:38.341 --> 12:41.052
We've already wasted 10 minutes.

12:41.762 --> 12:44.014
I'll ask you this just once:

12:46.308 --> 12:49.436
Do you know who
the man in your room was?

12:49.603 --> 12:51.897
YOUNG MAN DISAPPEARS IN BIERGE

12:56.151 --> 12:57.652
If you want to find out,

12:57.819 --> 13:01.865
if you want me to get you
out of this without jail time,

13:02.783 --> 13:04.451
don't lie to me again.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.135
It all started three months ago.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.687
- Honey.
- How's Paris?

13:34.731 --> 13:38.193
- Full of nasty French people.
- Did the meeting go badly?

13:38.360 --> 13:40.654
- I don't think we'll get it.
- My dad called.

13:40.821 --> 13:43.782
He invited us sailing on Sunday.
I said we'd go.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.909
- He's dying to see Alex.
- Okay.

13:46.076 --> 13:49.579
It's Daddy. Say Daddy.
Say Daddy.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.624
Sonia, I have to leave
for the airport.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.919
Okay. Are you coming home
or staying in Barcelona?

14:00.423 --> 14:02.008
I'm coming home to you.

14:02.175 --> 14:05.011
Tell me when you've boarded.
I love you.

14:05.262 --> 14:06.930
I love you too.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.357
- Who was that?
- Sonia.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.150
What time is it?

14:19.317 --> 14:21.736
Almost six. We overslept.

14:39.754 --> 14:40.797
- Shall we go?
- Daddy.

15:20.211 --> 15:23.506
- We were doing fine.
- Sure, but this way is faster.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.216
You could drive faster, eh?

15:28.219 --> 15:30.513
- Shall I drive?
- You drive.

15:34.351 --> 15:35.769
What?

15:37.145 --> 15:39.189
I do nothing but lie.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.986
I think when you're with me,
you don't.

15:47.405 --> 15:49.532
The rest of the day
I lie because I'm with you.

15:51.117 --> 15:54.287
Being with me makes you happy.

15:56.247 --> 15:59.459
And I love the way I feel
when we're together.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.505
Remember what we said
when we started this?

16:03.880 --> 16:06.132
That we both wanted the experience.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.637
We also said that when
the time came...

16:10.804 --> 16:13.348
- Adrián, do you want to leave Sonia?
- No.

16:13.515 --> 16:17.018
I don't want to leave Bruno either.
That's why what we have is perfect.

16:19.062 --> 16:21.439
But you can't have everything.

16:22.065 --> 16:23.900
You have to sacrifice something.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.655
We're doing fine.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.116
It's fine.

16:31.282 --> 16:33.827
No, what we're doing is wrong,
and you know it.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.290
That's it.

16:43.962 --> 16:45.422
I'm sorry.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.690
Are you alright?

17:05.650 --> 17:06.734
I think so.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.477
Hello?

17:54.449 --> 17:55.909
Are you alright?

18:14.636 --> 18:15.595
Shit!

18:22.477 --> 18:24.354
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.481
It's wasn't our fault,
it was the damn deer.

18:26.648 --> 18:27.690
I cut into his lane.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.359
He had no belt on
and he was texting!

18:29.526 --> 18:31.361
You made me drive too fast!

18:31.528 --> 18:34.906
You told me before,
there's always a sacrifice.

18:35.073 --> 18:37.117
- What are you saying?
- It's him or us.

18:37.283 --> 18:40.203
If you call the police,
we've had it.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.288
Listen to me, please.

18:43.498 --> 18:46.835
Nobody saw anything,
nobody knows anything.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.879
Everything's still the same.
Your life, Sonia,

18:50.421 --> 18:53.383
your daughter, your career.

18:56.261 --> 18:58.638
You don't want to lose it all?

19:00.598 --> 19:01.933
Do you?

19:10.984 --> 19:12.443
Let's go.

19:28.293 --> 19:29.669
It won't start up.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.255
Come on, please start.

19:32.422 --> 19:35.758
Start! Start, for God's sake!
Let's go!

19:37.719 --> 19:39.512
- Shit.
- What is it?

19:39.804 --> 19:41.139
Someone's coming.

19:48.104 --> 19:49.647
Get out of the car.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.241
- What do we do?
- Leave it to me. Do what I do.

20:00.408 --> 20:01.326
Where are you going?

20:18.635 --> 20:19.677
He'll figure it out.

20:20.136 --> 20:22.055
What are you doing?

20:22.639 --> 20:24.474
We had an accident, okay?

20:24.641 --> 20:26.476
- We had an accident?
- Follow my lead.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.274
Hello.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.820
Need any help?
What happened?

20:39.113 --> 20:43.117
I skidded and hit him,
but we're just trading details.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.161
Do you need an ambulance?

20:45.328 --> 20:48.164
No, really, we're fine.
Thanks.

20:50.667 --> 20:51.584
Are you sure?

21:07.600 --> 21:10.144
It must be the insurance company.
I'll be right back.

21:15.316 --> 21:16.109
Hey.

21:17.860 --> 21:18.903
A good scare?

21:19.570 --> 21:22.156
A deer ran in front of us
and I'm still shaky.

21:27.537 --> 21:28.705
Hello?

21:28.871 --> 21:31.249
Hello. Yes, we called.

21:31.416 --> 21:32.875
- Are you sure?
- Thank you.

21:38.339 --> 21:39.924
How long will it be?

21:48.016 --> 21:49.642
Okay. Thanks. 'Bye.

21:53.146 --> 21:54.230
It's all sorted.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.399
I'm glad nobody got hurt.

21:56.816 --> 21:57.942
Thanks.

21:58.401 --> 22:00.111
- See you.
- See you.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.783
- What if he saw something?
- He didn't.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.493
He stopped,
he could've seen the kid.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.454
- We have to get rid of him.
- Are you crazy?

22:09.620 --> 22:10.830
There's a witness.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.957
If we leave him here,
he'll know we lied.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.376
Please.

22:30.058 --> 22:33.811
It's best if I stay here
and send for help.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.022
You take care of the body.

22:37.523 --> 22:38.733
What do I do with him?

22:39.776 --> 22:40.943
I don't know.

22:41.319 --> 22:44.238
But we have to get rid
of everything, okay?

22:46.199 --> 22:48.618
And then, if you want,
we can stop seeing each other.

22:51.079 --> 22:52.497
It's over.

23:14.018 --> 23:15.978
I drove for nearly an hour.

23:16.938 --> 23:18.731
And all I could think about

23:18.898 --> 23:21.401
was why I was there
instead of with my family.

23:24.612 --> 23:26.489
If I hadn't been with Laura,

23:26.989 --> 23:30.451
if we hadn't overslept,
if I hadn't taken the detour,

23:34.247 --> 23:37.041
that deer would never have
crossed my path.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.502
Ever.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.383
What did you do with the car?

23:49.470 --> 23:51.097
I buried it.

23:53.558 --> 23:55.351
The kid too?

26:22.415 --> 26:25.209
I kept hearing Laura's words
in my head.

26:29.297 --> 26:32.717
It was an accident.
We couldn't do anything for that kid.

26:33.843 --> 26:35.886
He had no future. We did.

26:36.387 --> 26:37.805
We did.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.232
He was like one of those blotches,

26:50.276 --> 26:54.113
and I had to look at it like that
to keep from going insane.

26:58.117 --> 26:59.869
What then?

27:01.495 --> 27:04.874
I called Laura with a prepaid
phone card and told her where I was.

27:05.207 --> 27:08.419
We always used them
to talk to each other.

27:20.890 --> 27:22.558
It was horrible.

27:24.060 --> 27:25.394
What happened?

27:26.103 --> 27:27.480
Hello, my car broke down.

27:27.647 --> 27:30.232
No, I'm fine,
but I need a tow truck.

27:30.983 --> 27:31.859
Yes.

27:32.485 --> 27:33.569
Where am I?

28:26.205 --> 28:27.915
- Hello.
- Hello. Everything alright?

28:28.082 --> 28:30.418
Yes, a deer ran in front of me,
but I'm fine, thanks.

28:31.502 --> 28:33.254
You're lucky.
You could've died.

28:33.879 --> 28:37.258
It won't start.
The engine won't start.

28:37.425 --> 28:40.094
I called road assistance
but they're overrun.

28:40.261 --> 28:42.346
Everything has a solution.

28:42.513 --> 28:45.099
I know these cars in and out,
they're good machines.

28:45.266 --> 28:46.517
What a coincidence.

28:46.684 --> 28:49.145
I was an engineer at
their Spanish factory years ago.

28:49.311 --> 28:50.855
Tomás Garrido.
I've got a garage now.

28:52.189 --> 28:53.441
Nice to meet you.

28:54.650 --> 28:57.361
- I need to get to Barcelona.
- Got a flashlight?

29:02.575 --> 29:05.995
It's my sister's car.
She lent it to me and I don't know...

29:07.663 --> 29:10.499
Don't worry. I'll get mine.

29:25.848 --> 29:27.808
It's the starter system.

29:29.310 --> 29:32.772
The engine sensor's probably
stuck on "stop".

29:33.564 --> 29:35.357
If the impact didn't damage
anything else,

29:35.524 --> 29:38.068
you just reconnect the control module
and reset it.

29:39.403 --> 29:41.447
The rest looks alright.

29:41.614 --> 29:44.867
If you want, I can tow it
to my house

29:45.034 --> 29:46.368
and fix it there.

29:48.746 --> 29:50.706
If you prefer, I'll call a tow truck

29:50.873 --> 29:53.167
and tell them where to find you.

29:53.334 --> 29:54.960
- How long would it take?
- The tow truck?

29:55.127 --> 29:59.006
- No, for you to fix it.
- A couple of hours, tops.

30:00.049 --> 30:01.091
Alright.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.141
So you live in Barcelona.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.228
What brings you here?

30:12.770 --> 30:14.688
My sister lives in Barbastro.

30:16.106 --> 30:19.860
My wife worked near there,
in the nature reserve.

30:20.069 --> 30:23.864
Now she works near Bierge,
in the valley, 20 minutes from home.

30:26.951 --> 30:30.079
She used to teach literature,
but she had to give it up.

30:30.246 --> 30:31.664
Cancer.

30:32.873 --> 30:37.002
That's why we moved here,
for a more peaceful life.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.879
What do you do?

30:47.263 --> 30:49.265
I've got a bookstore.

30:50.099 --> 30:51.684
I love reading.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.478
Especially plays.

30:54.645 --> 30:58.107
The classics are my weakness.
My wife introduced me to them.

30:58.524 --> 31:01.652
That was how we met,
in a theatre group.

31:02.444 --> 31:04.697
She was very good, but I...

31:05.197 --> 31:07.658
I just joined to meet women.

31:10.452 --> 31:12.705
You haven't told me your name.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.083
- Raquel.
- Raquel.

31:18.419 --> 31:20.170
Raquel, your phone's ringing.

31:22.423 --> 31:23.799
You're right.

31:28.721 --> 31:30.180
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, Laura.

31:30.639 --> 31:33.309
How was the shoot?
When's your flight?

31:33.475 --> 31:35.561
I was about to call you.
I'm going to be late.

31:35.728 --> 31:36.562
Don't worry.

31:36.729 --> 31:39.815
I was about to take some work home.
You can't concentrate here.

31:39.982 --> 31:41.191
Too many interruptions.

31:41.358 --> 31:43.444
How come you're late?

31:43.611 --> 31:47.031
Nothing, a setback.
Engine trouble.

31:47.197 --> 31:49.575
Relax, just tell me
when you're taking off.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.035
No, you don't need to get me.

31:51.201 --> 31:54.663
I'll get some dinner here
and work till it's time to get you.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.917
- Don't come, please, Bruno.
- Laura, are you alright?

31:58.083 --> 31:59.335
Sorry, sorry, no,

31:59.501 --> 32:01.378
I'm fine, I really am.

32:01.545 --> 32:03.005
Sorry I didn't call you before.

32:03.172 --> 32:05.674
Okay, don't worry.
See you at home.

32:05.841 --> 32:06.508
I love you.

32:06.675 --> 32:08.302
I love you too.

32:17.937 --> 32:19.229
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

32:20.314 --> 32:21.565
Elvira, my wife.

32:21.732 --> 32:23.609
This is Raquel,
she ran into a deer

32:23.776 --> 32:25.986
and it blocked the car's starter.
I'm going to fix it.

32:26.153 --> 32:27.821
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

32:28.197 --> 32:30.658
Are you hurt?
You have blood on your hand.

32:33.410 --> 32:35.371
- It must be from the deer.
- The deer?

32:35.537 --> 32:37.998
- Let me see. A cut could get infected.
- I'm not hurt.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.835
Sorry, I'm in a big hurry.

32:42.002 --> 32:44.463
Then we'll cut the chatter.
I'll get to work.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.507
- Like a coffee?
- Yes, please.

32:46.966 --> 32:49.301
- Come in.
- No, I can wait here.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.261
Wait here in this cold?
Come in, woman.

32:51.428 --> 32:52.846
You can clean that up.

32:53.681 --> 32:54.598
Come on.

33:18.789 --> 33:19.790
Everything alright?

33:20.332 --> 33:21.834
Yes, thanks, everything's fine.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.794
I'll take Tomás some coffee
and be right back.

33:24.545 --> 33:26.088
Okay, thanks.

34:24.438 --> 34:27.315
We had a couple of scares too
when we came here.

34:27.983 --> 34:31.652
- You don't want anything to eat?
- No.Thanks.

34:32.404 --> 34:35.616
It's a good place to live,
but you have to adapt.

34:37.367 --> 34:38.744
Children?

34:40.245 --> 34:42.246
Do you have any children?
I see that...

34:42.414 --> 34:43.956
Oh, no, no.

34:44.583 --> 34:45.751
My husband wants to, but I...

34:45.918 --> 34:49.670
Well, I do too,
but I work a lot, I don't know...

34:49.838 --> 34:51.547
Don't let it get to you.

34:52.091 --> 34:55.219
I had Dani, I mean Daniel,
he doesn't like Dani,

34:55.385 --> 34:58.180
when I was nearly 40.
A child changes your life.

35:00.766 --> 35:02.726
But they give it all back too.
Excuse me.

35:05.687 --> 35:08.357
So handsome. He'll be home soon.
Maybe you know him.

35:11.360 --> 35:13.403
Clara? Hello.

35:14.738 --> 35:17.366
No, I'm waiting for him.
He went out with the boys.

35:18.992 --> 35:20.119
What?

35:21.662 --> 35:22.871
You're with the boys?

35:25.249 --> 35:26.625
And Daniel's not there?

35:28.710 --> 35:31.672
That's strange, he left here at 6.

35:35.843 --> 35:36.552
Yes.

35:37.469 --> 35:40.222
Yes, he got back from work,
changed, and ran out.

35:43.767 --> 35:44.434
Right.

35:44.601 --> 35:47.938
You're all set.
I went over it and it's fine.

35:48.105 --> 35:51.775
Are you staying for dinner?
I'm sure my wife convinced you.

35:52.401 --> 35:53.277
Okay.

35:53.443 --> 35:55.904
I'll get my coat,
I'm really late. Sorry.

35:56.071 --> 35:59.199
Yes, okay, Clara,
I'll call you right back.

36:02.244 --> 36:06.290
Clara says the boys haven't seen Daniel,
they thought he was with her.

36:08.167 --> 36:11.795
- What do you mean?
- He should be with his friends.

36:11.962 --> 36:14.631
But nobody knows anything.
Did he say anything to you?

36:15.632 --> 36:18.719
Okay, don't get nervous.
Maybe he had other plans.

36:18.886 --> 36:21.555
Nervous no, Tomás,
he told be he'd be with friends.

36:21.722 --> 36:24.725
- Maybe he didn't tell you the truth.
- Why?

36:26.059 --> 36:27.936
What if he met another girl?

36:28.812 --> 36:31.356
No, Tomás, no.
This is all very strange.

36:31.982 --> 36:33.275
I'm going to call him.

36:37.988 --> 36:40.157
Leave him be. He's a big boy.

36:48.165 --> 36:50.125
- Do you hear that?
- Yes.

36:59.927 --> 37:01.845
Did you hear a cell phone?

37:03.513 --> 37:05.015
I'm calling him again.

37:06.892 --> 37:10.854
My son's not with his friends
and my wife's imagining things.

37:30.207 --> 37:31.667
Here it is.

37:33.043 --> 37:36.171
That's strange. Daniel never
goes out without his cell phone.

37:37.047 --> 37:39.091
He must've dropped it.

37:39.258 --> 37:40.884
You tell her, Raquel.

37:41.635 --> 37:43.679
I have to go. I'm really late.

38:06.451 --> 38:08.287
No one's heard from Daniel.

38:25.554 --> 38:26.847
What do we do?

38:29.766 --> 38:31.310
Tell me what we should do.

38:34.855 --> 38:36.231
I thought of something.

38:40.152 --> 38:41.737
But I'm in your hands.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.660
It depends on you.

38:53.165 --> 38:54.791
The look in her eyes scared me.

38:57.878 --> 39:00.839
I got rid of my car,
without a trace.

39:16.188 --> 39:20.567
I don't know,
it's in front of a scrapyard.

39:27.657 --> 39:31.370
Then I said goodbye, agreeing that
it was the last time we'd see each other.

39:39.711 --> 39:41.963
I reported my car stolen,

39:42.130 --> 39:44.341
pretending I just got back from Paris.

39:46.551 --> 39:48.220
I told Sonia the same thing:

39:48.387 --> 39:51.723
I'd stayed overnight
in our city place.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.308
But are you alright?

39:53.475 --> 39:54.935
I spent a sleepless night.

39:55.811 --> 39:58.188
I felt like a fraud, an impostor.

39:59.314 --> 40:02.526
It had taken me ten years
to reach the top,

40:03.819 --> 40:07.155
but I could lose it all
in the blink of an eye.

40:09.324 --> 40:11.159
The next day, I went to work.

40:12.536 --> 40:15.914
We were preparing the entry
of Global Go Tech Media into Asia

40:16.331 --> 40:18.583
and it would've been strange
if I wasn't there.

40:20.377 --> 40:23.130
I'd been trying to close
the deal for a year,

40:23.797 --> 40:26.758
and now it was about to happen
I couldn't screw it up.

40:33.432 --> 40:36.143
Before going home,
I tried to gather my thoughts

40:36.309 --> 40:38.812
in order to face my wife
and daughter.

40:41.690 --> 40:43.108
I needed to put on a mask

40:43.275 --> 40:46.319
to hide the man I wasn't
but would be again.

40:52.159 --> 40:54.161
And when I thought I'd done it...

40:55.036 --> 40:56.079
the inevitable happened.

40:56.246 --> 41:02.502
Daniel Garrido, 23,
left work in this bank around 6 p.m.

41:02.669 --> 41:06.673
He went home and minutes later
went out again.

41:07.048 --> 41:10.760
His parents expected him for dinner,
but they've heard nothing from him.

41:10.927 --> 41:13.263
Family and friends
have united to search for him,

41:13.430 --> 41:15.599
believing he had a car crash

41:15.765 --> 41:19.436
and perhaps his car is hidden
down a ravine in the area.

41:20.896 --> 41:23.607
The father's face
engraved on my retina.

41:24.733 --> 41:26.359
I saw myself in his pain.

41:30.489 --> 41:33.992
I swore it'd be the last mistake
I'd ever make in my life.

41:37.245 --> 41:38.622
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

41:43.084 --> 41:44.169
Hello.

41:47.547 --> 41:48.965
Are you sure?

41:52.552 --> 41:54.346
Tell me if there's any news.

42:00.894 --> 42:03.230
The state's witness
is in the courthouse.

42:03.980 --> 42:06.858
His identity is unknown,
but the judge is on his way.

42:10.362 --> 42:11.821
I have to talk to Felix.

42:15.742 --> 42:17.452
- What is it?
- Félix, where are you?

42:17.619 --> 42:19.579
Bilbao airport, getting off the plane.

42:19.746 --> 42:22.666
Virginia Goodman's here because
the prosecutor may be ahead of us.

42:22.832 --> 42:25.085
- The prosecutor...?
- When will you be back?

42:25.252 --> 42:27.045
Tonight on the last flight.
Put her on.

42:28.046 --> 42:29.297
He wants to talk to you.

42:32.759 --> 42:34.261
- Félix.
- What's going on?

42:34.803 --> 42:36.137
A last-minute witness.

42:36.304 --> 42:38.682
- He just got to the courthouse.
- Virginia?

42:38.848 --> 42:41.977
Mr. Doria will probably
have to testify tonight.

42:42.143 --> 42:44.396
Send me the details in writing,
but I leave him in your hands.

42:44.563 --> 42:47.315
I'm going after something big.
It may be crucial to the case.

42:47.482 --> 42:49.734
- I'll call back in a couple of hours.
- Alright.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.444
Thanks, Félix.

43:03.498 --> 43:04.749
What did he say?

43:09.004 --> 43:11.172
It's all under control, don't worry.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.883
Good. Let's continue.
Where were we?

43:15.802 --> 43:17.220
I focused on my life.

43:20.724 --> 43:22.267
But the police came around.

43:22.642 --> 43:24.227
Mr. Doria, you have visitors.

43:24.686 --> 43:26.062
It's the police.

43:27.897 --> 43:29.441
That's not on any file.

43:29.608 --> 43:31.234
How do you know?

43:31.651 --> 43:33.737
The details, Mr. Doria.

43:45.081 --> 43:48.918
The Bierge police found debris
from two collisions

43:49.085 --> 43:52.631
five miles from where
the missing man lived.

43:52.797 --> 43:56.343
But there's no record
of either of the accidents.

43:57.510 --> 44:02.098
Strangely, the kid's father picked up
a woman who'd had an accident,

44:02.265 --> 44:05.560
right there, the same day
his son disappeared.

44:14.569 --> 44:16.071
Do you know her?

44:30.001 --> 44:31.002
What is this?

44:31.169 --> 44:35.173
Look, why would my client care
about what happened in Bierge

44:35.340 --> 44:36.716
when he was in Paris?

44:36.883 --> 44:40.679
She told the missing kid's father
that she'd hit a deer.

44:41.554 --> 44:44.766
But debris from a second vehicle
on that road

44:44.933 --> 44:47.811
leads us to the theory
that something happened

44:47.977 --> 44:50.438
and she covered it up
with someone's help.

44:50.605 --> 44:51.272
And?

44:51.481 --> 44:54.651
The license plate of the vehicle
this woman was driving

44:54.818 --> 44:58.154
belongs to a BMW
in your client's name.

44:58.321 --> 45:01.449
It was stolen from a private carpark
that weekend.

45:01.616 --> 45:04.160
Are you insinuating
the Mr. Doria is lying

45:04.327 --> 45:06.913
to hide an accident
about which you have no proof?

45:07.080 --> 45:08.039
According to the report,

45:08.206 --> 45:12.085
you couldn't produce the parking card
to prove the car was there.

45:12.293 --> 45:14.295
I lost it.
I usually keep it in my wallet,

45:14.462 --> 45:17.173
but I must've left it in my jacket
and it fell out on the trip.

45:17.340 --> 45:20.552
I know, it's in your statement.
Very convenient.

45:20.719 --> 45:24.764
Hold on, did the license plate info
come from the missing kid's father?

45:26.766 --> 45:30.353
Now that is convenient,
and uncorroborated.

45:30.520 --> 45:33.231
That's what we're trying to do:
corroborate it.

45:33.398 --> 45:36.484
You needn't have bothered my client
to corroborate his Paris trip,

45:37.068 --> 45:39.904
you just had to ask his secretary
for the details.

45:40.697 --> 45:41.781
Are we done?

45:48.413 --> 45:49.622
Why are you so nervous?

45:53.752 --> 45:56.045
Tell me or I won't be able to help you.

45:56.588 --> 46:00.008
Do you have anything to do
with this kid's disappearance?

46:00.759 --> 46:02.093
Well then?

46:07.265 --> 46:08.349
I wasn't in Paris.

46:11.978 --> 46:13.563
I was with a woman.

46:15.106 --> 46:19.110
So Eva can't prove to the police
that you were in Paris?

46:19.861 --> 46:23.072
Can you make them believe I was?
Can you buy me an alibi?

46:23.239 --> 46:25.950
- Do I have a choice?
- I ended it, it was a mistake.

46:27.118 --> 46:29.496
I can't let this damn coincidence

46:29.662 --> 46:31.998
ruin my life with Alex
and Sonia. I can't.

46:32.749 --> 46:36.878
Next time you call me,
start by telling me everything.

46:41.674 --> 46:42.926
I need something else.

46:46.304 --> 46:47.055
What?

46:48.389 --> 46:50.934
The police file.
I don't want this to haunt me.

46:53.478 --> 46:55.104
I'll take care of it.

46:55.688 --> 46:57.190
Later, my Paris alibi
was checked out

46:57.357 --> 46:59.442
and the police dropped the matter.

46:59.609 --> 47:03.404
Félix fulfilled the first part of
the deal, but not the second.

47:03.571 --> 47:07.826
One of my sources found
your name in the police files,

47:07.992 --> 47:10.829
and I'm afraid that the prosecutor
may have done the same.

47:16.125 --> 47:18.253
I'd never have gone so far
if it weren't for Laura.

47:18.419 --> 47:22.131
What did she do when you told her
the police asked you to ID her?

47:22.298 --> 47:23.299
I didn't tell her.

47:25.510 --> 47:27.595
I know you contacted her.

47:27.762 --> 47:31.891
The rich want to stay rich,
protect themselves and their property.

47:32.058 --> 47:36.813
Wherever there are rich people,
there are surveillance cameras.

47:36.980 --> 47:40.567
How'd you get the police to think
Daniel Garrido was on the run?

47:40.733 --> 47:43.611
- Where are you calling from?
- A phone booth.

47:43.778 --> 47:47.073
Talking in a place with so much
surveillance isn't very smart.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.492
My nerves gave me away, I know.

47:51.369 --> 47:53.997
But don't think I'm stupid enough
to contact Laura

47:54.163 --> 47:57.125
right after the police
tried to link me to her.

47:57.292 --> 47:58.877
When and why then?

48:01.671 --> 48:03.882
When I saw
how far she could go.

48:06.801 --> 48:09.345
Laura never stopped
when she knew what she wanted.

48:10.597 --> 48:12.432
- Hello.
- Say hi to Grandpa.

48:12.599 --> 48:14.183
She did it with me when we met.

48:14.350 --> 48:15.184
Can I pay up?

48:16.477 --> 48:19.230
And she was doing it again
to put it all behind her.

48:19.397 --> 48:20.189
There you go.

48:20.356 --> 48:23.526
The police have ruled out
that Daniel Garrido,

48:23.693 --> 48:27.989
the young man from Bierge
missing for 3 weeks, had an accident.

48:28.156 --> 48:29.866
The latest investigations say

48:30.033 --> 48:34.412
he could've faked his own
disappearance in order to run away.

48:34.662 --> 48:37.123
Police sources state

48:37.290 --> 48:41.961
that he took 50,000 euros from
the bank branch where he worked.

48:42.128 --> 48:46.215
Daniel Garrido
redirected small amounts...

48:46.382 --> 48:47.926
All ready to set sail.

48:49.052 --> 48:52.805
I just got a call.
An emergency meeting with Mr. Lee.

48:53.014 --> 48:55.016
- Where are you calling from?
- A booth.

48:57.644 --> 49:00.772
See you in four hours
in the bar in front of the scrapyard.

49:12.700 --> 49:13.910
What's this?

49:15.578 --> 49:16.871
The kid's wallet.

49:18.831 --> 49:20.708
I got it before putting
the kid in the trunk.

49:24.128 --> 49:26.589
I thought it might be useful to us,
and it has been.

49:28.591 --> 49:31.719
After the accident,
Bruno worked at home for a few days.

49:33.304 --> 49:37.392
I used one of those mornings
to end this the only possible way.

50:40.747 --> 50:42.248
What are you telling me?

50:42.498 --> 50:46.878
Your lover was a computer banking
expert as well as a photographer?

50:47.045 --> 50:49.005
Do you want the jury to think
you're taking them for idiots?

50:49.172 --> 50:51.382
Laura met her husband while
she was working in that bank.

50:51.549 --> 50:55.511
Technology makes giant leaps,
you know that better than anyone.

50:55.678 --> 50:58.264
Did your love keep up to date
while she was a photographer?

50:58.431 --> 50:59.891
Maybe her husband helped her.

51:00.725 --> 51:03.811
Maybe she told him the truth
but wanted to keep me out of it.

51:04.896 --> 51:06.939
You didn't know Laura.

51:07.523 --> 51:09.108
She can highly seductive.

51:09.275 --> 51:11.527
The perfect femme fatale prototype.

51:11.694 --> 51:14.405
Do you realize what you've done?

51:15.364 --> 51:16.657
What do you think?

51:18.201 --> 51:21.621
Don't worry, if I'd left any trace,
we wouldn't be here right now.

51:24.290 --> 51:25.249
What?

51:26.167 --> 51:28.086
Don't look at me like that.

51:28.878 --> 51:31.005
You didn't call the police because
we were doing the right thing.

51:31.172 --> 51:33.049
No, we weren't.

51:33.925 --> 51:35.051
Adrián,

51:36.219 --> 51:39.305
if I go down,
you're going down with me.

51:39.472 --> 51:43.226
The police came to see me.
Don't threaten me.

51:45.353 --> 51:48.064
Don't you threaten me.

51:49.816 --> 51:52.485
I have photos that show
that you weren't in Paris.

52:34.360 --> 52:37.113
The following days
weren't exactly relaxed.

52:37.738 --> 52:42.451
My company entered the Asian market
with the world's top technology firm.

52:43.744 --> 52:46.289
I was given
the Businessman of the Year award.

52:47.206 --> 52:49.292
I entered a media blitz.

52:55.381 --> 52:57.341
Mr. Doria, how do you feel?

52:58.885 --> 53:00.136
Very happy.

53:00.303 --> 53:03.014
I was sold as the man of the hour.

53:03.514 --> 53:07.018
A model for young people like me,
winners who came from nothing.

53:08.144 --> 53:10.021
But it was all a sham.

53:10.521 --> 53:13.566
I'd felt rotten on the inside
for some time.

53:21.699 --> 53:23.117
Because I taught her.

53:23.284 --> 53:24.785
- To do what?
- To say "Papa".

53:24.952 --> 53:26.537
She's with her parents now...

53:26.704 --> 53:29.123
Mr. Doria, excuse me.
A reporter insists on speaking to you.

53:29.290 --> 53:31.792
- He says he knows you.
- Yes.

53:31.959 --> 53:34.420
- Please.
- If you'll excuse me.

53:34.587 --> 53:36.839
Be careful with that.

53:38.007 --> 53:39.133
See you soon.

53:44.138 --> 53:46.265
On the right, please.
Thank you.

54:01.906 --> 54:05.368
Mr. Doria? Sorry to bother you
on such a special day.

54:09.497 --> 54:10.539
Do you know who I am?

54:13.751 --> 54:15.878
Just that you're not Iván Souto.

54:24.095 --> 54:25.429
Please.

54:26.514 --> 54:28.182
I'm Daniel Garrido's father.

54:28.349 --> 54:31.310
I don't know if
you've seen the news, but...

54:31.727 --> 54:35.398
they say he ran away
and I have some questions,

54:35.564 --> 54:37.275
if it's alright with you.

54:38.609 --> 54:42.363
I only know what I read
in the paper, I'm sorry.

54:42.655 --> 54:46.951
My son is no thief
and he's not on the run.

54:47.994 --> 54:49.578
My son is dead.

54:49.954 --> 54:52.832
Someone is laughing
at my wife and at me.

54:54.458 --> 54:58.254
The day the police spoke to you,
Elvira and I were there.

55:01.590 --> 55:02.758
I know what I saw.

55:03.301 --> 55:05.261
Our son used his cell phone

55:05.428 --> 55:08.681
shortly before Tomás picked up
that woman on the road,

55:09.181 --> 55:12.226
so it's impossible that
the phone was at home,

55:12.393 --> 55:14.228
unless she brought it.

55:14.395 --> 55:16.230
And that could only happen

55:16.397 --> 55:19.734
if she ran into my son
at some point.

55:19.900 --> 55:22.486
And she wasn't alone,
someone was with her.

55:22.653 --> 55:23.946
How can you be so sure?

55:24.113 --> 55:28.200
I've already told you.
She adjusted the driver's seat.

55:30.411 --> 55:31.329
She wasn't driving.

55:32.288 --> 55:33.164
She lied to me!

55:33.331 --> 55:34.874
It's my sister's car.

55:35.041 --> 55:37.335
She lent it to me
and I don't know...

55:37.501 --> 55:40.254
She lied and nobody lies
for no reason.

55:41.964 --> 55:46.052
She lied to protect herself,
or to protect you.

55:46.719 --> 55:47.928
Got a light?

55:49.638 --> 55:51.891
That woman was hiding something.

56:04.945 --> 56:05.946
And so are you.

56:08.824 --> 56:10.618
I don't know anything, really.

56:11.577 --> 56:13.579
I was in Paris at the time.

56:14.163 --> 56:15.664
That's what the police said.

56:16.582 --> 56:19.335
But some plane tickets
and a hotel reservation

56:19.502 --> 56:20.878
don't prove anything.

56:22.129 --> 56:26.217
Still, we trusted the police
and went home.

56:31.305 --> 56:32.723
Until a few days later

56:32.890 --> 56:36.018
when the news accused my son
of being a thief...

56:42.817 --> 56:46.153
and we knew it was a set-up,
it wasn't Daniel.

56:46.862 --> 56:48.739
He was never bad to anyone.

56:51.909 --> 56:55.579
My wife was devastated
when she saw what that meant.

56:59.166 --> 57:01.293
But I wasn't giving up.

57:03.421 --> 57:05.673
And I followed the only lead left.

57:07.133 --> 57:08.259
You.

57:10.886 --> 57:14.056
And I saw that you could
lose it all over a setback.

57:16.559 --> 57:20.813
What it would mean if
you admitted you weren't in Paris

57:20.980 --> 57:23.232
but with another woman.

57:25.276 --> 57:28.320
I went back to the police
but they still didn't believe me.

57:29.530 --> 57:31.907
There I realized
how powerful you are.

57:33.534 --> 57:36.287
Power makes the wolf
bigger than he is.

57:36.454 --> 57:39.081
But I'm not scared
of wolves like you.

57:40.708 --> 57:43.878
When you have the most terrifying
experience a parent can go through,

57:44.044 --> 57:46.046
having your child taken from you,

57:46.213 --> 57:48.174
vanishing without anyone caring,

57:48.841 --> 57:50.801
fear doesn't exist anymore.

57:51.802 --> 57:53.220
Nothing exists anymore.

57:56.432 --> 57:58.934
They'll soon discover
that I'm an intruder,

58:00.311 --> 58:02.104
so tell me the truth:

58:03.022 --> 58:04.773
Where is my son?

58:07.193 --> 58:09.153
I assure you, you're mistaken.

58:09.320 --> 58:12.531
You were in that car,
with that woman not called Raquel.

58:12.698 --> 58:15.493
You had an accident
in the place where I found her,

58:15.659 --> 58:17.786
and my son's car was there.

58:18.162 --> 58:20.581
Did you get rid of him?

58:22.291 --> 58:24.043
Was it that easy?

58:41.018 --> 58:42.311
Mr. Doria,

58:42.645 --> 58:44.355
was that what happened?

58:45.439 --> 58:47.441
From one father to another.

58:48.901 --> 58:51.862
My wife and I know
our son is dead.

58:52.404 --> 58:55.115
We just want to find him, bury him
and let him rest in peace.

58:55.282 --> 58:56.784
- Sir, you have to come with us.
- Don't touch me.

58:56.951 --> 58:58.536
- Please.
- Don't touch me!

58:58.702 --> 59:02.122
Please, Mr. Doria, I'm begging you.
Don't touch me! Please!

59:02.331 --> 59:04.875
If your girl had disappeared,

59:05.042 --> 59:08.796
you'd want the culprit to know
he wouldn't get away with it.

59:08.963 --> 59:10.256
Son of a bitch!

59:13.884 --> 59:15.469
Do you know him?

59:15.844 --> 59:17.471
Do you know him?

59:24.061 --> 59:25.688
Let's go inside.

59:33.362 --> 59:38.200
- Address?
- 5 San Ramón St., Bierge.

59:39.285 --> 59:41.328
No one linked him to me.

59:41.495 --> 59:42.329
Telephone?

59:42.496 --> 59:44.081
Nor did he.

59:45.791 --> 59:48.085
He knew it'd just complicate things.

59:49.253 --> 59:52.715
And Félix had cleared my name
from his son's case.

59:52.881 --> 59:54.258
- What town was that?
- Bierge.

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:10.274
He went home with just enough
strength to look after his wife.

01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:19.241
After that, he vanished.

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:22.911
I never heard from him again.

01:00:26.373 --> 01:00:30.669
Fine. Now we have all the cards
on the table.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:34.423
Two dead people and two bodies.

01:00:35.132 --> 01:00:36.550
Your lover's murder

01:00:36.717 --> 01:00:40.095
seems to be a direct result
of the death of Daniel Garrido.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:44.141
But for the police
there's only one murder

01:00:44.308 --> 01:00:46.977
because they only have one body,
Laura Vidal's.

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:49.897
And the suspect is you.

01:00:50.064 --> 01:00:53.776
But for us
and for Daniel Garrido's parents,

01:00:54.193 --> 01:00:57.905
there's another body
and another death: the missing kid.

01:00:59.406 --> 01:01:03.285
And the Garridos suspect that you
and your lover are the culprits.

01:01:03.619 --> 01:01:06.997
She's dead, so all that's left...

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:09.750
is you.

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:13.837
What does this puzzle
suggest to you?

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:16.882
What does it suggest to you?

01:01:17.049 --> 01:01:20.803
It makes me think of
the mystery in the hotel room,

01:01:20.969 --> 01:01:24.390
of the man you say
killed your lover

01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:27.935
and then vanished, as if by magic.

01:01:28.394 --> 01:01:30.813
Someone linked to Daniel Garrido.

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.776
There's someone unnamed
who knows more than the parents.

01:01:38.237 --> 01:01:39.238
Need any help?

01:01:39.405 --> 01:01:43.409
Do you want the jury to believe that
this driver lured you to that hotel?

01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:44.660
To what end?

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:48.372
To blackmail us with what he knew:
that we were guilty.

01:01:49.248 --> 01:01:51.500
Why he didn't know who I was
and that Laura wasn't my wife.

01:01:51.667 --> 01:01:53.502
Details, Mr. Doria.

01:01:53.669 --> 01:01:56.880
A jury will only believe
your twisted theory

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:58.590
if the details are plausible.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:01.844
I haven't told you how
he lured us to the Hotel Bellavista.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.057
This came for you.

01:02:12.187 --> 01:02:14.481
SENDER: DANIEL GARRIDO

01:02:23.532 --> 01:02:25.909
I know what you
and you little friend did.

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:29.496
The price for my silence
is 100,000 euros.

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:32.291
In small, unmarked bills.

01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:36.420
Unless I get them today,
I'll send this photo

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:40.215
to the police so that
they find Daniel Garrido.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:47.431
At 5 o'clock sharp

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:51.477
both of you are to go to
the Bierge train station.

01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:54.855
Be punctual.

01:02:55.022 --> 01:02:57.149
I'll call the phone booth
in the carpark

01:02:57.316 --> 01:02:59.943
and tell you where to
hand over the money.

01:03:00.110 --> 01:03:02.488
Don't come alone,
without the money,

01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:04.531
or try anything,

01:03:04.698 --> 01:03:06.658
or I'll call the police.

01:03:08.035 --> 01:03:10.537
The package was sent
from Bierge three days ago.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.458
The sender signed it:
Daniel Garrido.

01:03:16.794 --> 01:03:19.296
- Was this where...?
- If it isn't, it looks a lot like it.

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:24.009
Mr. Doria.

01:03:24.218 --> 01:03:26.220
Did you notice the moon?

01:03:29.932 --> 01:03:32.142
There's a huge full moon tonight.

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:37.397
As big as the hole in your story.

01:03:37.564 --> 01:03:39.233
How do you know
unless you let me finish?

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:41.026
How did that driver
know about the swamp?

01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:43.403
The noise I heard
before the car sank.

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:46.949
What if it wasn't just the deer?

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:52.412
What if Laura hadn't
convinced him we'd crashed?

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:53.872
I'm glad it was nothing.

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:55.332
Thanks.

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:59.419
Maybe he saw something
or suspected our attitude,

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:02.381
then pretended to leave
in order to hide.

01:04:02.548 --> 01:04:04.591
Sure. I understand your problem.

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:08.428
You're trying to lead your story
away from Daniel Garrido's death.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:10.556
- Excuse me?
- The driver was motivated by money.

01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:13.976
If you focus on
the blackmailing driver

01:04:14.142 --> 01:04:17.271
and people ignore the poor kid,
you'll look less guilty.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:18.856
Have you got a better idea?

01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:21.650
I'm going to ask you three questions.

01:04:21.817 --> 01:04:23.652
If you answer just one,

01:04:23.819 --> 01:04:26.154
we'll go on
with your far-fetched story.

01:04:27.114 --> 01:04:31.118
One: Why the incriminating message
on your cell phone?

01:04:31.285 --> 01:04:35.038
Two: Why didn't the killer take
the money if that was his main aim?

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:39.167
And three: How did he get
in and out of the room

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:41.169
like a ghost?

01:04:43.422 --> 01:04:44.131
Do you see?

01:04:44.715 --> 01:04:47.217
You're giving the prosecutor
just what he wants:

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:50.387
unconnected crap that will
shatter the illusion

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:52.806
that you have a solid story
without cracks.

01:04:52.973 --> 01:04:54.725
Don't give me that again.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:59.271
Surprise me,
solve one of the questions.

01:04:59.438 --> 01:05:00.105
Alright.

01:05:00.272 --> 01:05:03.150
I'll tell you what could've happened
from what you've told me.

01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:05.611
- Please.
- Let's go back to the station,

01:05:05.777 --> 01:05:09.239
where the blackmailer
had to contact you at 5 pm.

01:05:13.744 --> 01:05:15.746
It's 5 o'clock. It must be him.

01:05:17.331 --> 01:05:19.541
We shouldn't be seen together.

01:05:32.304 --> 01:05:33.055
Hello?

01:05:33.221 --> 01:05:35.766
I'll wait for you
in the Hotel Bellavista.

01:05:36.183 --> 01:05:40.646
It's only accessible by using
the cog railway around the valley.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:45.984
I reserved room 715 for you.

01:05:47.194 --> 01:05:50.322
Another thing:
Leave the cell phone in the bin.

01:05:50.489 --> 01:05:54.534
Take the train that's
right in front of you.

01:05:54.701 --> 01:05:56.870
If you don't leave the cell phone,

01:05:57.037 --> 01:05:59.873
the police will discover
the body of Daniel Garrido.

01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:44.793
I'll ask. Wait here, okay?

01:06:52.175 --> 01:06:54.136
- Hello, good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

01:06:54.302 --> 01:06:58.140
I have a reservation.
Room 715, please.

01:06:59.975 --> 01:07:02.102
Yes, in the name of Adrián Doria?

01:07:03.979 --> 01:07:05.856
Fill in this form

01:07:06.023 --> 01:07:08.025
and I'll get your key.

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:06.833
Did anyone see you?

01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:10.003
Did he leave instructions?

01:08:10.462 --> 01:08:11.713
We have to wait.

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:17.886
Something wrong?

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:20.388
He just sent me a message
from your phone.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.057
I'LL TELL EVERYTHING.
ROOM 715. HOTEL BELLAVISTA.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.142
It's a trap.

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:25.644
Let's go.

01:08:38.532 --> 01:08:39.366
Adrián?

01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:44.578
No, no, no.

01:08:44.746 --> 01:08:46.372
No, no. Please.

01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:49.792
I don't know where he is.
It wasn't me.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.837
It wasn't me,
I don't know where he is.

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:04.224
Hold on.

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:06.393
Hold on.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:09.563
You suspect that Tomás Garrido
was the person in the room?

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:10.939
Don't you?

01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:13.817
It's a plausible option
to use to build your defense,

01:09:13.984 --> 01:09:16.278
something the judge could buy.

01:09:16.444 --> 01:09:20.031
Tomás Garrido has a powerful motive
for committing murder.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:24.411
If a father knows that the police

01:09:24.578 --> 01:09:27.372
are protecting those responsible
for his son's disappearance,

01:09:27.538 --> 01:09:30.625
he has only one option:
force them to face up to it.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:34.337
And killing one to incriminate
the other is a way to do it.

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:35.755
Exactly.

01:09:35.921 --> 01:09:37.340
And it worked out perfectly.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.759
Everyone thought you were guilty.

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:43.555
The police, your own wife,
and your financial partners.

01:09:43.721 --> 01:09:47.184
Tomás Garrido not only framed you
for your lover's death,

01:09:47.350 --> 01:09:49.519
he destroyed your life
and your company.

01:09:49.685 --> 01:09:54.064
And only Félix could get you
out of jail on a million-euro bail.

01:09:54.232 --> 01:09:56.193
Together you set up the theory
of the plot

01:09:56.359 --> 01:09:59.070
and I suspect he hired me

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:01.072
because he wasn't confident
it'd be enough.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:04.826
Your lawyer knew that
if your story convinced me,

01:10:05.452 --> 01:10:06.870
it'd convince a jury.

01:10:07.746 --> 01:10:10.832
You hired someone to tell me
what to say in a trial, Felix?

01:10:10.999 --> 01:10:13.335
She's the top person
at preparing witnesses.

01:10:13.501 --> 01:10:17.172
She retired two weeks ago,
but she's taking this as a last case.

01:10:17.339 --> 01:10:20.300
And I assure you,
she doesn't want to lose it.

01:10:20.759 --> 01:10:25.263
The only way you can show
that you didn't kill your lover

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:27.557
is to implicate Tomás Garrido,

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:30.769
and that means confessing
what you did to his son.

01:10:34.856 --> 01:10:36.233
Sure, but that does us no good

01:10:36.399 --> 01:10:39.277
unless we work out how he
got out of the room without a trace.

01:10:39.444 --> 01:10:41.988
And when I came to,
there was no one.

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:43.823
Help!

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:45.200
Police!

01:10:46.493 --> 01:10:50.914
Are you familiar with
the concept of lateral thinking?

01:10:51.957 --> 01:10:55.460
It consists of changing
the perspective from which

01:10:55.627 --> 01:10:57.337
one analyzes events.

01:10:57.504 --> 01:11:01.883
For example: in a wooden barn
that is completely empty

01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:06.096
a man is found hanging from
the middle of the main beam.

01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:09.307
The rope he hanged himself with
is 10 feet long

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:12.852
and his feet are 10 inches
above the floor.

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:16.606
The nearest wall is 20 feet away.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:20.026
You can't climb the walls
or reach the beam,

01:11:20.193 --> 01:11:23.321
yet the man hanged himself.

01:11:23.989 --> 01:11:25.573
How did he do it?

01:11:27.701 --> 01:11:30.328
He climbed onto a block of ice
that melted from the heat.

01:11:31.788 --> 01:11:34.374
This is our barn.

01:11:36.835 --> 01:11:39.963
The police photo file on your case.

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:48.763
The answer has to be
in the nature of your own story.

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:55.729
I don't know what
you expect me to see.

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:57.731
The details, Mr. Doria.

01:11:58.231 --> 01:12:00.150
Focus on the details.

01:12:01.359 --> 01:12:04.446
They've always been
in front of our eyes,

01:12:04.612 --> 01:12:08.033
but you have to analyze them
from a different perspective.

01:12:10.618 --> 01:12:14.914
What if the answer to the enigma
was never inside the room,

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:16.875
but outside?

01:12:17.042 --> 01:12:19.085
Now she works near Bierge,
in the valley,

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:20.295
20 minutes from home.

01:12:20.628 --> 01:12:23.298
Being lured to that hotel
so far away is no coincidence.

01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:26.092
Tomás Garrido set a trap for you.

01:12:27.927 --> 01:12:30.597
He could've sent you
that package himself

01:12:31.431 --> 01:12:35.060
so you'd put the pieces
of the puzzle together wrongly

01:12:35.435 --> 01:12:38.355
and make you doubt
what really happened,

01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:43.026
because it was the only way
he'd find the missing piece.

01:12:44.736 --> 01:12:45.737
Hello?

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:48.198
I'll wait for you
in the Hotel Bellavista.

01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:50.033
**He couldn't have known
about the swamp.

01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:53.328
The area where you buried him
is full of swampy lakes

01:12:53.495 --> 01:12:55.288
and the locals know it.

01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:59.417
Tomás Garrido only had to
toss a coin in the air

01:12:59.793 --> 01:13:02.128
and wait for you to bite.

01:13:05.173 --> 01:13:06.674
And you did.

01:13:07.217 --> 01:13:09.594
- Was that what happened?
- You revealed yourself

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.180
and gave up Laura.

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:44.772
Here's your key
and have nice stay.

01:14:44.939 --> 01:14:46.232
- Thanks a lot.
- Thank you.

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:48.109
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, good afternoon.

01:14:48.276 --> 01:14:50.278
I have a reservation.
Room 715, please.

01:14:50.445 --> 01:14:51.738
That was how Tomás Garrido

01:14:51.905 --> 01:14:55.241
was able to get into the room
without leaving a trace.

01:14:55.408 --> 01:14:57.202
All he had to do

01:14:57.368 --> 01:14:59.913
was wait for you and Laura
to go up to the room.

01:15:00.079 --> 01:15:03.500
From there he could send
the message from Laura's phone...

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:06.252
He just sent me a message
from your phone.

01:15:07.212 --> 01:15:09.839
...knock you out
to keep you out of action,

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.594
and carry out the perfect crime.

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:18.556
- Did you hear that?
If it was like that,

01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:22.268
Tomas Garrido only had to
prepare the scene to frame you

01:15:22.435 --> 01:15:25.980
and vanish the way out
his wife had set out.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:28.650
He left the money to frame you,

01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:31.694
put Laura's cell phone
back in the room...

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:36.616
and made sure they found
your prints on the murder weapon.

01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:52.590
Hello? Is everything alright?

01:15:53.633 --> 01:15:55.718
No one's come out.

01:16:01.307 --> 01:16:02.308
Hello?

01:16:35.216 --> 01:16:36.551
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:16:36.718 --> 01:16:38.219
Where did the noises come from?

01:16:38.386 --> 01:16:40.722
A suite. Number 715.

01:17:05.496 --> 01:17:08.666
Out of the way!
Out of the way, please!

01:17:13.671 --> 01:17:14.672
Police!

01:17:15.673 --> 01:17:17.050
Open the door.

01:17:33.483 --> 01:17:34.817
Everyone out!

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:36.319
Come on, out.

01:17:38.363 --> 01:17:39.864
Call Forensics.

01:17:40.031 --> 01:17:44.369
- Guys, tell Forensics, we've found a body.
- Roger that.

01:17:54.045 --> 01:17:57.799
The kid's mother was
why they took us to that hotel.

01:17:58.341 --> 01:17:59.634
All she had to do

01:17:59.801 --> 01:18:03.096
was make her husband vanish
so that I'd look guilty.

01:18:04.347 --> 01:18:06.683
And the police
never linked her to you

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:10.895
because Félix erased your name
from his son's case.

01:18:12.355 --> 01:18:13.439
Excuse me.

01:18:17.485 --> 01:18:18.569
Hello.

01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:21.823
Confirmed?

01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:24.492
One hundred per cent?

01:18:26.077 --> 01:18:28.162
Good. Alright, thanks.

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:30.665
The prosecutor's witness?

01:18:30.832 --> 01:18:33.918
We still don't have his name,
but we know who he is.

01:18:34.502 --> 01:18:35.920
The driver.

01:18:36.754 --> 01:18:38.506
It means we have to think fast.

01:18:38.673 --> 01:18:42.427
- It also means I'm screwed.
- Not totally, if you obey me.

01:18:42.844 --> 01:18:46.681
Suppose you weren't in the cabin
with your lover that day.

01:18:47.098 --> 01:18:49.392
You were in Paris,
as your alibi says.

01:18:49.809 --> 01:18:52.895
Laura rented it,
it's only in her name.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:19:01.279
So you weren't at the accident
that killed Daniel Garrido.

01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:02.196
Hello?

01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:06.159
The license plate and the other
evidence is circumstantial.

01:19:06.325 --> 01:19:09.036
Therefore, it was Laura
who carried out the plan,

01:19:09.203 --> 01:19:11.831
faking that the kid was fleeing
because of embezzlement.

01:19:15.376 --> 01:19:19.630
We have to convince the judge that
you were one more of Laura's victims

01:19:19.797 --> 01:19:23.259
and you ended up in that hotel room
because she asked you for help.

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:26.596
Perhaps you knew nothing about
Daniel Garrido until that moment

01:19:26.763 --> 01:19:29.932
and the father is unjustly
accusing you of his disappearance.

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:32.268
You want to turn me
into Laura's victim?

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.062
The only piece we're missing

01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:38.691
is a way to link her directly
to Daniel's body.

01:19:38.858 --> 01:19:39.859
Tell me one thing.

01:19:40.026 --> 01:19:41.235
How will you do it?

01:19:42.278 --> 01:19:45.323
Hiding an object of Laura's
in the submerged car.

01:19:45.990 --> 01:19:50.828
We have to incriminate only her
in Daniel's disappearance.

01:19:53.664 --> 01:19:55.333
Your only crime

01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:57.919
will be having
covered it up unwillingly.

01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:11.682
Where did you sink it?

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:16.896
We'll inform the police about
the body's location anonymously.

01:20:17.063 --> 01:20:18.481
You won't have to admit a thing.

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:21.275
But no body, no crime,
and without a crime,

01:20:21.442 --> 01:20:24.320
we can't convince a jury
that Laura's murder

01:20:24.487 --> 01:20:25.905
wasn't a crime of passion.

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:30.535
We'll get close enough to the truth
that you don't get burnt.

01:20:31.077 --> 01:20:34.413
How can I not get burnt
if the prosecutor holds the trump card?

01:20:35.706 --> 01:20:36.833
Hello.

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:38.960
The driver will place me
at the crash scene.

01:20:39.126 --> 01:20:39.877
Need any help?

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:41.712
Félix has been looking for him
to neutralize him.

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:44.006
The prosecutor has no witness.

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:46.175
What's that?

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:48.177
No one's seen the judge.

01:20:48.344 --> 01:20:51.013
I made it up and adjusted it
in line with

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.558
the details you've given me.

01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:55.476
Are you kidding me?

01:20:55.643 --> 01:20:58.688
Why didn't you tell me
the truth from the start?

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:05.570
To find out if you could get
Tomás Garrido to vanish from the room.

01:21:09.156 --> 01:21:11.200
I've always known he was guilty.

01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:17.164
And it wasn't hard to find out
that his wife works in the hotel.

01:21:20.001 --> 01:21:22.211
Why did you wait
for me to tell you?

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:26.841
To make sure I can put my life
in your hands, Ms. Goodman.

01:21:31.345 --> 01:21:32.638
Where did you sink it?

01:21:41.606 --> 01:21:43.733
It was here.

01:22:06.505 --> 01:22:08.507
I have something else to tell you.

01:22:22.355 --> 01:22:25.107
We thought he was dead, I swear.

01:22:31.405 --> 01:22:33.824
Laura had taken it so far,
there was no turning back.

01:22:33.991 --> 01:22:37.119
If the police found the kid,
the autopsy would give me away.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:39.372
I had to be sure
you'd help me stop it.

01:22:42.166 --> 01:22:46.295
It's my duty to save you from jail,
not from who you are.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.005
Rubbish, Mr. Doria.

01:22:48.172 --> 01:22:50.299
And you'll take what I say
because you need me.

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:53.928
The kid was virtually dead, I had
to decide in a split second.

01:22:55.805 --> 01:22:59.266
Don't lie to yourself.
You're a murderer!

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:01.602
You're testing me again, right?

01:23:01.769 --> 01:23:03.854
So I can handle
the prosecutor's attacks.

01:23:04.021 --> 01:23:06.023
What you've said changes everything.

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.109
Now you're on my hands.

01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:12.363
You've told me enough.
If I tell the judge this,

01:23:12.530 --> 01:23:13.739
you're ruined.

01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:15.324
But you can't do that!

01:23:17.118 --> 01:23:18.661
You hear me? You can't.

01:23:18.828 --> 01:23:23.207
That's what the prosecutor
will look for, your despair.

01:23:23.416 --> 01:23:26.127
And look how easy
I got it out of you.

01:23:26.293 --> 01:23:28.379
You want to insult me?
Go ahead.

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:30.464
The prosecutor will be
looking for that too,

01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:33.342
to bring out the arrogant fool
you have inside.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:34.552
That's enough!

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:39.265
Aren't you here to defend me?

01:23:41.475 --> 01:23:43.102
Then defend me.

01:24:03.247 --> 01:24:06.459
I won't let my record be tainted
on my last day.

01:24:09.170 --> 01:24:12.173
From now on,
we'll do things my way.

01:24:12.673 --> 01:24:15.843
For that I need to be sure
that there are no more loose ends.

01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:17.636
- There aren't.
- There aren't?

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:19.889
But I think you're still using me.

01:24:20.056 --> 01:24:23.684
Testing your adulterated version
of the facts on me, like I'm a puppet.

01:24:23.851 --> 01:24:25.144
Which part doesn't fit?

01:24:25.311 --> 01:24:27.938
True, it all could've happened
the way you said.

01:24:28.105 --> 01:24:30.816
But what if it wasn't you

01:24:30.983 --> 01:24:34.236
who broke the promise
not to meet again, but Laura?

01:24:34.403 --> 01:24:37.281
How did you make the police
think Daniel Garrido had fled?

01:24:37.448 --> 01:24:39.158
See you in 4 hours in the bar

01:24:39.325 --> 01:24:40.743
- in front of the scrapyard.
- Okay.

01:24:40.910 --> 01:24:43.037
- Don't be late.
- Okay, yes, I'll be there.

01:24:43.204 --> 01:24:46.248
...redirecting small amounts
from his customers

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:47.833
shortly before disappearing.

01:24:49.460 --> 01:24:52.379
You could've gotten
the kid's things too.

01:24:53.047 --> 01:24:54.882
Adrián, what is all this?

01:24:55.257 --> 01:24:56.842
The kid's wallet.

01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.887
I got it before I put him
in the trunk.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:02.348
Put a price on it.

01:25:02.515 --> 01:25:05.017
You've always had the means
and contacts

01:25:05.184 --> 01:25:07.186
to change the course of events

01:25:07.353 --> 01:25:08.771
without leaving a trail.

01:25:08.938 --> 01:25:09.772
I'll take care of it.

01:25:10.731 --> 01:25:11.982
That's not true.

01:25:12.817 --> 01:25:14.902
- You can't prove it.
- Nor you the opposite.

01:25:15.236 --> 01:25:17.238
Let's look at it backwards.

01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:19.365
Hello.

01:25:19.532 --> 01:25:20.991
Wouldn't the pieces fit

01:25:21.158 --> 01:25:24.453
if you'd taken the initiative
in all of this?

01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.288
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:29.542
Listen, it wasn't our fault,
it was the damn deer.

01:25:29.708 --> 01:25:31.043
Are you crazy?

01:25:32.503 --> 01:25:34.505
- What if he saw something?
- He didn't.

01:25:34.672 --> 01:25:35.840
We have to get rid of him.

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:40.427
What if Laura was the one

01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:43.848
dragged into a desperate situation
impossible to control?

01:25:46.851 --> 01:25:48.811
According to this medical report,

01:25:48.978 --> 01:25:52.022
your lover had acute anxiety attacks

01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:55.359
after her return from
your supposed trip to Paris.

01:25:56.026 --> 01:25:58.779
Even someone as heartless as her
can break down.

01:25:58.946 --> 01:26:02.032
That's exactly what doesn't fit
for me, Mr. Doria.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.660
That she instigated it all,

01:26:04.827 --> 01:26:07.079
would support that you
would've saved that kid.

01:26:07.246 --> 01:26:08.831
But you drowned him.

01:26:13.294 --> 01:26:14.962
POSSIBLE INVOLUNTARY DISAPPEARANCE

01:26:17.882 --> 01:26:21.051
And guilt of it bore down on her,

01:26:23.804 --> 01:26:26.140
slowly dragging her down.

01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:37.234
Where Adrián Doria
just received the European Award

01:26:37.401 --> 01:26:38.777
for Businessman of the Year.

01:26:38.944 --> 01:26:42.948
Until she saw there was only
one way to regain her dignity.

01:26:48.787 --> 01:26:51.957
She couldn't give those poor parents
their son back...

01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.629
- My companion was there.
- ...but something she could do

01:26:58.130 --> 01:27:00.216
was tell them the truth.

01:27:03.886 --> 01:27:04.845
Daniel.

01:27:05.804 --> 01:27:09.600
So she arranged to meet them
in the hotel where the mother worked.

01:27:09.767 --> 01:27:13.103
An out of the way place
to carry out her plan.

01:27:14.063 --> 01:27:17.149
She went to Bierge alone
and crossed the valley.

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:21.528
When she got to the station
by the hotel,

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:26.575
she called you from a public phone
so you wouldn't suspect anything.

01:27:29.370 --> 01:27:30.788
Somebody knows something.

01:27:31.080 --> 01:27:33.999
She made you believe
the driver had seen something...

01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:35.960
Then why answer the phone?

01:27:36.126 --> 01:27:38.796
...and had found her
and was blackmailing them.

01:27:39.838 --> 01:27:43.467
It was her way of compensating
those poor people for their loss.

01:27:44.593 --> 01:27:48.013
She hadn't the courage to confess it
with her hands empty.

01:27:49.348 --> 01:27:52.685
Once in the hotel room,
she just had to wait

01:27:53.227 --> 01:27:55.938
and put the second part
of her plan in motion.

01:27:56.188 --> 01:27:57.731
She programmed a message
into her phone

01:27:57.898 --> 01:28:00.567
as a protective measure.

01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:05.406
Laura knew you'd refuse to confess,

01:28:05.572 --> 01:28:07.783
because you only care about one thing:

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:09.618
yourself.

01:28:14.623 --> 01:28:18.502
You made sure no one saw you arrive
at the room where Laura was waiting.

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:29.430
But Laura had already crossed
the point of no return.

01:28:30.597 --> 01:28:34.518
And when she told you her plan,
you lost your head.

01:28:42.359 --> 01:28:44.486
When you got her programmed message,

01:28:44.653 --> 01:28:48.615
you realized that you'd fallen
into her trap.

01:28:57.166 --> 01:28:59.626
The reservation's in your name too.

01:29:01.628 --> 01:29:03.088
We're going to give them the money.

01:29:04.548 --> 01:29:06.508
We're going to tell them
where you buried their son

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:10.179
and we're going to
turn ourselves in, Adrián.

01:29:12.473 --> 01:29:14.141
There's no turning back.

01:29:36.455 --> 01:29:37.790
I didn't kill her

01:29:37.956 --> 01:29:41.877
and I'll never testify
before a jury. Never.

01:29:42.044 --> 01:29:46.548
You killed her and you were trapped
in a room you couldn't escape from.

01:29:48.926 --> 01:29:51.845
Hello? Is everything alright?

01:30:02.773 --> 01:30:05.401
You thought the message
could be useful to you

01:30:06.527 --> 01:30:10.531
and you searched for elements
to back your wild theory.

01:30:17.663 --> 01:30:18.872
Police!

01:30:21.417 --> 01:30:22.167
Are you alright?

01:30:25.879 --> 01:30:27.131
Police!

01:30:30.134 --> 01:30:32.845
Fine. You want to play?

01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:34.346
Let's play.

01:30:35.681 --> 01:30:38.308
Why haven't Tomás Garrido
or his wife spoken up?

01:30:38.475 --> 01:30:41.562
If Laura was going to tell them
the truth, why not call the police?

01:30:41.812 --> 01:30:43.605
They know you'll never
incriminate yourself

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:46.817
by digging up their son's body,

01:30:46.984 --> 01:30:50.237
and without a body
it's hard to prove a crime.

01:30:50.404 --> 01:30:51.905
And they also know

01:30:52.072 --> 01:30:55.659
you'd do anything
to get away with it,

01:30:55.826 --> 01:30:59.413
even framing them
for your lover's death.

01:31:00.539 --> 01:31:01.874
Come with me.

01:31:13.969 --> 01:31:16.972
Second window on the right
of the second last floor.

01:31:18.474 --> 01:31:21.477
Take a good look, Mister Dorian.

01:31:26.940 --> 01:31:30.277
Tomás Garrido stopped trusting
the police a long time ago,

01:31:30.444 --> 01:31:33.197
and since then
he's been watching you

01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:35.991
in order to take justice
into his own hands.

01:31:46.752 --> 01:31:48.712
You assume things you can't know.

01:31:48.879 --> 01:31:51.548
- I know more about him than you think.
- Why?

01:31:51.715 --> 01:31:53.550
You're smart. Work it out.

01:31:53.717 --> 01:31:55.260
I want an answer.

01:31:56.595 --> 01:31:59.097
When Tomás and his wife
got to the hotel

01:31:59.264 --> 01:32:01.099
and found out about Laura's death,

01:32:01.266 --> 01:32:03.685
they understood what had happened.

01:32:03.936 --> 01:32:06.230
They probably studied their chances

01:32:06.396 --> 01:32:07.856
and hesitated about what to do,

01:32:08.023 --> 01:32:10.192
but with no faith in justice,
what was left for them?

01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:12.861
Watch their enemy and wait.

01:32:13.362 --> 01:32:15.030
All they could do was watch you.

01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:26.333
Tomás Garrido became your shadow.

01:32:31.797 --> 01:32:34.216
He found a vacant room
opposite your building

01:32:34.383 --> 01:32:36.677
and took it over anonymously.

01:32:37.427 --> 01:32:40.514
Since then, he's had you

01:32:40.681 --> 01:32:43.267
and anyone near you
in his sights.

01:32:43.433 --> 01:32:46.228
Every meeting, every conversation,

01:32:46.395 --> 01:32:48.355
every move you've made to get free,

01:32:48.522 --> 01:32:51.608
Tomás Garrido has been there
to witness it.

01:32:52.025 --> 01:32:54.361
And of course he got to me.

01:33:01.535 --> 01:33:04.246
Who was he and what was
he doing in front of my office?

01:33:08.917 --> 01:33:11.837
I realized that he was
following Félix,

01:33:12.546 --> 01:33:16.091
so I had him watched.

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:21.680
The kid's father brought you
to me, not the reverse.

01:33:22.306 --> 01:33:25.851
He gave you the thread to pull
to reach Daniel Garrido.

01:33:34.443 --> 01:33:37.821
This photo proves it all could've
happened the way I said.

01:33:37.988 --> 01:33:40.949
You're still not listening or
paying attention to the details.

01:33:41.116 --> 01:33:42.743
The kid's mother was in the room.

01:33:42.909 --> 01:33:45.287
She was off that day.

01:33:45.454 --> 01:33:47.581
She went there with her husband
to meet Laura.

01:33:47.748 --> 01:33:49.708
This photo proves that...

01:33:49.875 --> 01:33:52.085
This photo is a fake.

01:33:53.587 --> 01:33:55.756
It's been manipulated,
it's a set-up.

01:33:58.800 --> 01:34:00.719
Look at the mirror.

01:34:07.476 --> 01:34:09.519
Now tell me:

01:34:09.686 --> 01:34:13.690
Do you want my help?
For the judge to believe you?

01:34:13.857 --> 01:34:16.735
Then admit that you killed Laura.

01:34:16.902 --> 01:34:18.111
I killed her.

01:34:35.504 --> 01:34:38.465
Adrián, are you there?
Your phone's off.

01:34:38.632 --> 01:34:40.509
Call me when you can.

01:34:41.218 --> 01:34:43.804
The miracle we hoped for
has happened.

01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:51.019
Here, this is your boarding card.

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:52.604
Seat B52.

01:34:56.316 --> 01:34:58.652
Talk to him, it sounds important.

01:34:59.903 --> 01:35:02.823
10 minutes break
and we'll start over.

01:35:03.657 --> 01:35:05.701
I know the strategy
for your defense.

01:35:06.076 --> 01:35:07.577
Don't worry.

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:10.580
I'm going out to clear my head.

01:35:10.747 --> 01:35:12.416
- Do you have coffee?
- Yes.

01:35:13.208 --> 01:35:16.044
We'll need it.
It's going to be a long night.

01:35:16.378 --> 01:35:17.462
Okay.

01:35:26.555 --> 01:35:27.556
Ms. Goodman.

01:35:36.356 --> 01:35:37.399
Thank you.

01:36:05.385 --> 01:36:07.095
- Félix.
- I've been calling you.

01:36:07.262 --> 01:36:08.972
My phone went off. What is it?

01:36:09.139 --> 01:36:10.307
I found him.

01:36:10.599 --> 01:36:12.851
You were never on that road.

01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:15.645
Can we trust him?

01:36:20.734 --> 01:36:21.985
Completely.

01:36:23.945 --> 01:36:25.655
That's perfect.

01:36:27.407 --> 01:36:29.075
How is it with Virginia Goodman?

01:36:29.534 --> 01:36:31.411
I had to tell her everything.

01:36:32.037 --> 01:36:34.372
- Everything?
- Everything.

01:36:34.790 --> 01:36:36.249
How do you feel?

01:36:37.542 --> 01:36:39.836
You're right, she's very good.

01:36:41.797 --> 01:36:43.548
We can trust her.

01:36:45.842 --> 01:36:49.429
What was that prosecutor story?
The plane noise drowned you out.

01:36:50.055 --> 01:36:51.723
Nothing, don't worry.

01:36:53.767 --> 01:36:55.227
What the hell was that?

01:36:55.393 --> 01:36:56.478
What's going on?

01:36:57.020 --> 01:36:58.230
Félix, can you hear me?

01:37:06.738 --> 01:37:09.908
- Are you there?
- I'll call you back.

01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:12.994
Shit...

01:37:27.634 --> 01:37:29.135
No one's seen the judge.

01:37:29.302 --> 01:37:30.762
COWARD, MURDERER, IMPOSTOR

01:37:30.929 --> 01:37:33.056
The prosecutor has no witness.

01:37:33.390 --> 01:37:35.684
I made it up and adjusted it
in line with

01:37:35.851 --> 01:37:37.769
the details you've given me.

01:37:37.978 --> 01:37:41.231
- This photo shows...
- This photo is a fake.

01:37:41.398 --> 01:37:42.774
It's been manipulated.

01:37:43.692 --> 01:37:45.318
You assume things you can't know.

01:37:45.485 --> 01:37:48.363
- I know more about him than you think.
- Why?

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:50.615
You're smart. Work it out.

01:37:50.866 --> 01:37:53.243
My wife and I know
our son is dead.

01:37:53.410 --> 01:37:54.619
We just want to find him,

01:37:54.786 --> 01:37:56.454
bury him and let him rest in peace.

01:37:56.621 --> 01:37:59.165
But with no faith in justice,
what was left for them?

01:37:59.332 --> 01:38:01.293
Watch their enemy and wait.

01:38:01.793 --> 01:38:04.754
That was how we met,
in a theatre group.

01:38:06.089 --> 01:38:09.634
You've told me enough.
If I tell the judge this,

01:38:09.801 --> 01:38:11.678
you're ruined.

01:38:11.845 --> 01:38:12.804
Now you're on my hands.

01:38:13.638 --> 01:38:16.224
Adrián, are you there?
Your phone's off.

01:38:19.311 --> 01:38:20.729
All under control.

01:38:24.983 --> 01:38:27.235
And the Garridos suspect that you
and your lover.

01:38:27.402 --> 01:38:28.445
Are the culprits.

01:38:28.778 --> 01:38:29.988
She's dead,

01:38:30.155 --> 01:38:32.532
so all that's left... is you.

01:38:38.747 --> 01:38:39.831
Where did you bury him?

01:39:03.980 --> 01:39:06.691
There'll be no salvation
without suffering,

01:39:07.150 --> 01:39:09.152
and you're not smarter than I am.

01:39:25.377 --> 01:39:28.171
SONIA AND ALEX
MOTHER AND DAUGHTER

01:41:13.777 --> 01:41:15.111
Police. Can I help you?

01:41:15.278 --> 01:41:16.404
Mr. Doria?

01:41:16.571 --> 01:41:17.822
My name is Tomás Garrido.

01:41:17.989 --> 01:41:19.699
I'm Virginia Goodman.

01:41:20.033 --> 01:41:22.035
I'm Daniel Garrido's father.

01:41:24.287 --> 01:41:27.123
I want to tell you the truth
about what happened to my son.
