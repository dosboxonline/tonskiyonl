WEBVTT

02:08.563 --> 02:09.955
Thank you.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.270
Miranda.

02:24.231 --> 02:26.015
- Miranda!
- Mm.

02:27.103 --> 02:28.800
Oh, sorry, Annette.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.629
It's just--
it's the new Christie book.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.414
Aren't you
supposed to be at work?

02:33.414 --> 02:34.763
I would not
make it through the day

02:34.763 --> 02:36.199
if it were not
for this book.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.070
Oh, nonsense.

02:38.070 --> 02:41.335
You have a job, you don't live
in a boarding house.

02:41.335 --> 02:43.032
Well, you've done
quite well for yourself.

02:43.032 --> 02:44.381
Oh, so, that's it then?

02:44.381 --> 02:46.078
At least you're
surrounded by stories.

02:46.078 --> 02:47.645
I'm surrounded by plants.

02:48.255 --> 02:50.300
Flowers, Miranda.

02:50.300 --> 02:52.694
You're surrounded by flowers.

02:52.694 --> 02:55.523
I mean, you spend your days
surrounded by beauty

02:55.523 --> 02:59.266
and all you can think about
are your morbid little stories.

02:59.266 --> 03:00.876
Little stories?

03:00.876 --> 03:02.573
Would that we could
live a life

03:02.573 --> 03:04.967
a quarter
as Inspector Poirot.

03:04.967 --> 03:07.796
Solving cases,
uncovering plots,

03:07.796 --> 03:09.841
finding truth
in all of the lies.

03:09.841 --> 03:12.670
Creating order
out of the chaos.

03:12.670 --> 03:14.716
These are not little stories.

03:14.716 --> 03:17.284
Oh, speaking of, were you able
to find any more criminal--

03:17.284 --> 03:20.417
- It's from 1907, but--
- Annette!

03:20.417 --> 03:22.550
You're so wonderful.
Thank you.

03:22.550 --> 03:25.770
- Of course.
- Oh. Oh.

03:32.516 --> 03:33.952
- Miranda.
- Hmm?

03:33.952 --> 03:35.519
Shouldn't you
be getting to work?

03:43.048 --> 03:45.834
Every contact leaves a trace.

03:47.314 --> 03:48.315
Oh.

04:21.913 --> 04:24.176
Oh, oh, dear! Oh, my!

04:24.176 --> 04:26.744
- Let me help you.
- Thank you, Miranda, dear.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.617
I passed three others

04:29.617 --> 04:32.576
and you were my only tenant
to offer a hand.

04:32.576 --> 04:34.448
Oh, I'm sure
they just didn't notice.

04:34.448 --> 04:37.320
Well, that's what
I like about you, dear.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.714
You are always paying attention.

04:39.714 --> 04:41.716
Good evening, Mrs. Cavendish.

04:41.716 --> 04:44.588
Oh, I almost forgot.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.286
A man dropped this off today.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.678
Did he say who it was from?

04:47.678 --> 04:50.768
No, but he didn't seem
the courier type

04:50.768 --> 04:52.944
by the looks
of his suit jacket.

04:52.944 --> 04:57.297
Perhaps,
he's a gentleman caller.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.255
Oh, one would have
to meet gentlemen

04:59.255 --> 05:00.735
for them to come calling.

05:01.823 --> 05:04.086
Well, good night.

05:18.187 --> 05:22.974
"Miss Green, you have been
cordially invited
to Abbott Island

05:22.974 --> 05:28.719
for an audience
with Mr. Lewis Findley
over the upcoming weekend.

05:28.719 --> 05:32.810
All will be explained onsite,
please pack accordingly.

05:32.810 --> 05:36.336
<i>You may find your travel
accommodations enclosed."</i>

05:38.381 --> 05:40.035
Where's the return trip?

05:40.035 --> 05:41.689
<i>"Few concrete facts</i>

05:41.689 --> 05:44.300
<i>are known about
the English textile magnate</i>

05:44.300 --> 05:48.217
<i>outside of his extreme wealth,
estimated in the billions.</i>

05:49.087 --> 05:52.656
<i>The rest is hearsay
and speculation."</i>

05:58.923 --> 06:00.229
Well?

06:00.229 --> 06:02.405
I think
it's a strange proposition

06:02.405 --> 06:03.580
and you should take heed.

06:03.580 --> 06:05.277
You've no sense of adventure.

06:05.277 --> 06:08.237
Adventure?
I'm all for adventure.

06:08.237 --> 06:10.195
But, Miranda,
I know you better than this.

06:10.195 --> 06:13.634
You're careful, pragmatic,
and most of all, smart.

06:13.634 --> 06:16.637
And smart girls
don't run off to islands,

06:16.637 --> 06:18.769
because they received
an unmarked letter.

06:18.769 --> 06:20.292
It has Findley's seal.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.033
You said yourself
the seal is different.

06:22.033 --> 06:24.035
Well, I'm currently working
on a theory about that.

06:24.035 --> 06:25.994
Miranda, be reasonable.

06:25.994 --> 06:29.389
You're not Scotland Yard,
you're a florist.

06:30.564 --> 06:32.043
What would your mother say?

06:32.043 --> 06:34.002
You're being robbed.

06:34.785 --> 06:36.221
What? That makes no sense.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.746
Sir, you can take the books
out of your pockets now.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.182
I beg your pardon?

06:40.182 --> 06:42.358
There were 46 books
on the rear bookshelf,

06:42.358 --> 06:43.707
there's currently 44.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.762
She would say it'd be safe.

07:19.090 --> 07:22.485
Ah, here for Findley,
I suppose?

07:22.485 --> 07:25.923
Well, allow me
to introduce everyone.

07:26.620 --> 07:29.971
This is Miss Lu Wang.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.323
Not much of a talker that one.

07:34.323 --> 07:36.325
Then these chatterboxes

07:36.325 --> 07:38.936
are Phillip Armstrong, doctor,

07:38.936 --> 07:41.069
and make no mistake,
he will remind you.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.680
Well, my mother is very proud,
as is my uncle,

07:43.680 --> 07:46.857
- who is one of the top--
- Yes, fascinating.

07:46.857 --> 07:51.253
And then we have--
Ah, I'm terribly sorry, dear.

07:51.253 --> 07:53.255
I've already forgotten
your name.

07:53.255 --> 07:55.692
My name is Carmen Blanco.

07:55.692 --> 07:57.215
Pleased to meet you.

07:58.782 --> 07:59.957
And what about him?

08:01.481 --> 08:04.527
That is Donald Walker,

08:04.527 --> 08:07.225
an American journalist.

08:07.225 --> 08:10.446
Best to steer clear of that one.
He's a bit of a--

08:10.446 --> 08:11.491
Watch it, Kane.

08:12.579 --> 08:15.320
Yes, well...

08:15.320 --> 08:18.019
Lawrence Kane
at your service.

08:18.019 --> 08:19.760
Barrister by trade,

08:19.760 --> 08:22.676
London's foremost man
about town by reputation.

08:22.676 --> 08:25.287
Miranda Green. Florist.

08:25.287 --> 08:28.333
Ah, Miranda Green, florist.

08:28.333 --> 08:33.034
Welcome to our little party.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.520
They're all the same.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.915
Myself and those two
already checked.

08:48.136 --> 08:49.180
Hmm.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.096
And no one's met Findley?

08:52.096 --> 08:56.231
No. No connections at all.

08:56.231 --> 08:57.580
There shouldn't be six.

08:57.580 --> 08:59.147
I beg your pardon.

08:59.147 --> 09:01.845
There should only be five people
on this train.

09:01.845 --> 09:04.456
Ah, I, uh, I don't follow.

09:04.456 --> 09:07.068
There are five leaves
on the seal
which shouldn't be there.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.331
They don't appear
on Findley's seal anywhere else.

09:09.331 --> 09:11.420
It must have something to do
with the invitation,

09:11.420 --> 09:13.727
those invited,
but it doesn't make sense.

09:13.727 --> 09:16.381
There are five leaves
and six people.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.693
I'm sure
it's just a coincidence.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.608
I suppose it could be.

09:50.677 --> 09:51.721
Good afternoon, everyone.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.984
My name is Gordon,
Lord Findley's valet.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.595
If you can please make your way
to one of the cars,

09:55.595 --> 09:57.248
- we're a bit behind schedule.
- Could you please tell us--

09:57.248 --> 10:00.077
All will be explained
in due time, Mr. Armstrong.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.731
Now, if you'll
please make haste.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.690
Weather conditions have made
the trip to the island--

10:03.690 --> 10:05.561
Precarious.

10:05.561 --> 10:08.085
It's all a bit precarious,
ain't it?

11:22.290 --> 11:23.726
Right.

11:23.726 --> 11:26.033
Allow me to introduce Sean,
the house butler,

11:26.033 --> 11:27.599
and Katherine, our maid.

11:27.599 --> 11:30.254
They'll be at your service
for the duration of your stay.

11:30.254 --> 11:32.822
That's it?
Findley couldn't afford
more help?

11:34.171 --> 11:37.697
Lord Findley
prefers a more intimate

11:37.697 --> 11:39.046
staffing arrangement, sir.

11:40.438 --> 11:43.659
Yeah, sure he does.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.575
Excuse me,
where is Mr. Findley?

11:46.575 --> 11:48.533
- Uh, master--
- Lord Findley's plane

11:48.533 --> 11:50.535
was grounded by fog.

11:50.535 --> 11:53.887
There's an approaching storm
and he will be
joining us tomorrow.

11:53.887 --> 11:55.540
That doesn't leave us
much time.

11:55.540 --> 11:58.761
I took off almost
a week of work to be here.

11:58.761 --> 12:01.982
Forget almost.
I was on a story in Valdosta.

12:01.982 --> 12:05.550
You know how long it takes
to get from Georgia,
to New York, to here?

12:05.550 --> 12:06.638
Of course you don't.

12:06.638 --> 12:08.553
Well, five hours by rail
to Atlanta

12:08.553 --> 12:10.555
and five hours by plane
to New York.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.514
Yeah, okay. Alright.

12:12.514 --> 12:15.560
You will have
the appropriate audience
with Lord Findley, my dear.

12:16.474 --> 12:18.128
I can assure you of that.

12:18.128 --> 12:21.653
Well, if you'll allow me
to show you to your quarters.

12:21.653 --> 12:25.701
Uh, Sean and Katherine
will bring your belongings shortly.

12:25.701 --> 12:28.791
Quarters. I've never
stayed in quarters before.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.227
It's a room.

12:30.227 --> 12:31.838
Welcome, my dear.

12:33.056 --> 12:34.710
Lord Findley has instructed us

12:34.710 --> 12:37.278
to proceed with
the weekend as planned.

12:37.278 --> 12:40.020
As such, there will be
cocktails in the lounge,

12:40.020 --> 12:41.586
once you've settled in.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.939
Welcome to the east wing.

12:45.939 --> 12:48.376
If you'll follow me
to your individual quarters,

12:48.376 --> 12:51.422
the east wing houses
Lord Findley's guests.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.772
Mr. Walker.

12:55.687 --> 12:58.168
I think you'll find
your accommodations--

13:00.867 --> 13:03.913
Ms. Blanco, Ms. Wang,
and Mr. Armstrong.

13:11.529 --> 13:14.576
I think you'll find
your accommodations
more than satisfactory.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.579
I think this will suffice.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.673
Follow me.

13:24.673 --> 13:25.717
Oh.

13:29.591 --> 13:32.028
Mr. Kane. Ms. Green.

13:34.726 --> 13:37.642
Oh, uh, promise me
you'll keep it down, dear.

13:37.642 --> 13:39.122
I'm a bit of a light sleeper.

13:39.122 --> 13:41.255
Only if you guarantee the same.

13:41.255 --> 13:42.517
Hm.

13:43.866 --> 13:45.520
Don't fret, Miss Green,

13:45.520 --> 13:48.349
Lord Findley knows
his guests value their privacy.

13:48.349 --> 13:51.482
The rooms
have been soundproofed.

15:18.308 --> 15:19.440
I still find it funny.

15:19.440 --> 15:20.571
Thank you.

15:24.271 --> 15:26.838
My, my. My, my.

15:26.838 --> 15:30.842
- I had not seen that...
- No, well, I think...

15:30.842 --> 15:34.890
Ah, Miss Green,
what a pleasure it is
to have you join us.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.718
Would you care
for a refreshment?

15:36.718 --> 15:38.894
He makes a splendid Manhattan.

15:38.894 --> 15:43.594
Well, the master
also has a stocked cellar
from his private vineyard.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.553
That would be splendid.

15:46.554 --> 15:50.732
A vintage the master
was particularly fond of.

15:50.732 --> 15:51.820
Was?

15:51.820 --> 15:54.562
Hmm?
Oh, my apologies of course.

15:54.562 --> 15:58.174
No, the master simply had a...
well, a change of taste.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.611
Well, it's certainly better
than what I'm used to.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.701
Not much of a drinker, are you?

16:03.701 --> 16:07.009
I prefer to keep a clear head
in unfamiliar surroundings.

16:07.009 --> 16:09.098
Eh, that's smart.
I got this, thanks.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.274
Oh, Mr. Walker!

16:11.274 --> 16:14.451
What? The old man won't miss it.
Will he?

16:15.887 --> 16:17.150
Of course not, sir.

16:19.065 --> 16:20.022
Hmm.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.199
A toast, shall we?

16:23.199 --> 16:24.940
Since we're all
finally here together.

16:24.940 --> 16:27.464
What a lovely idea.
Come on, come on, come on.

16:27.464 --> 16:28.988
Gather around.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.381
You too, Walker,
you can brood later.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.992
- Up, up, up.

16:34.863 --> 16:36.517
What shall we toast to?

16:36.517 --> 16:38.562
To our generous host?

16:38.562 --> 16:41.304
To the workers
he used and discarded.

16:41.304 --> 16:44.438
- Oh.
- Why don't we toast
to new friends?

16:44.438 --> 16:48.398
Whatever the reason
and wherever the location,
we're all here together.

16:48.398 --> 16:51.532
In this world,
it's a small miracle.

16:51.532 --> 16:52.576
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

16:52.576 --> 16:53.621
- Cheers.

16:53.621 --> 16:57.146
- Oh.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.496
Terribly sorry.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.281
Oh, bloody hell.

17:01.281 --> 17:02.847
Quite bit of a fight.

17:02.847 --> 17:05.415
Why don't we all get to
know each other a little better?

17:05.415 --> 17:06.721
- Ooh.
- Ah.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.070
Shall we play a game?

17:08.070 --> 17:10.029
A delightful idea.

17:10.029 --> 17:14.076
I assume we all know
how to play
Two Truths and a Lie.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.469
- Nope.
- Oh, God.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.819
Oh, stop it you two.
This is going to be fun.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.516
Mm.
- I shall go first.

17:20.691 --> 17:23.564
- I am from Seville, Spain.
- Mm-hmm.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.696
I am a waitress
at my father's restaurant.

17:25.696 --> 17:27.002
- Hmm.
- Lie.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.177
Huh.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.614
Your bag looked
to be secondhand,

17:30.614 --> 17:35.097
and your coat,
it was a child size,
English in origin.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.664
But if your father
owned a restaurant,

17:36.664 --> 17:38.622
it would stand to reason
you would be able to afford

17:38.622 --> 17:40.102
at least one of the two, so...

17:40.102 --> 17:42.583
That's remarkable.
Is that true?

17:42.583 --> 17:46.978
Yes.
I-I never knew my father.

17:47.805 --> 17:49.111
Oh, Carmen.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.245
Dear,
I'm-I'm so sorry. I didn't--

17:52.245 --> 17:55.465
Hey, it is alright.
Good guess.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.467
Yeah, but it's not a guess,
is it?

17:57.467 --> 18:00.209
How did you do that?

18:01.167 --> 18:02.864
I just pay attention.

18:03.865 --> 18:05.388
I have a good memory,
I suppose.

18:05.388 --> 18:08.174
No, I have a-a good memory,
this is--

18:08.174 --> 18:09.784
this is something else entirely.

18:09.784 --> 18:12.917
Now, this is getting good.
You go, Doc.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.616
- I don't--
- No. No, we're doin' this.

18:15.616 --> 18:17.835
Come on, kid,
two truths one lie, go.

18:17.835 --> 18:22.275
Very well.
Um, I graduated from Oxford,

18:22.275 --> 18:24.059
my father
also graduated from--

18:24.059 --> 18:25.234
Lie.

18:25.843 --> 18:27.845
You don't know
your father either, do you?

18:29.891 --> 18:31.371
He's dead, isn't he?

18:31.371 --> 18:32.807
Come on, how?

18:33.373 --> 18:36.550
Well, his shoes
weren't properly polished,

18:36.550 --> 18:39.640
and on the train,
when he spoke of his family,

18:39.640 --> 18:42.164
he skipped from mother to uncle.
So, it stands to reason--

18:42.164 --> 18:43.948
Stands to reason.

18:44.732 --> 18:46.429
My father passed, too,

18:46.429 --> 18:47.735
if it's any consolation.

18:49.606 --> 18:53.958
It appears we have
our first commonality.

18:54.394 --> 19:00.400
No, my father is alive
and well in Guangzhou.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.621
Um, and you, Lawrence?

19:05.622 --> 19:07.015
Buckinghamshire.

19:08.408 --> 19:09.800
Mr. Walker?

19:09.800 --> 19:11.367
- I'll play next.
- No, I didn't--

19:11.367 --> 19:13.761
One, I'm a reporter
for <i>The Daily Truth.</i>

19:13.761 --> 19:15.110
Two, my mother's dead.

19:15.110 --> 19:17.678
And three,
I've never killed a man before.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.810
Three's the lie.
Game over.

19:21.943 --> 19:24.554
Asking the wrong questions
can get you hurt.

20:03.637 --> 20:08.250
I would suggest
you not wander too far.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.121
The house is easy
to get lost in.

20:10.121 --> 20:12.907
Oh, I have an excellent
sense of direction,

20:12.907 --> 20:15.910
but thank you
for your concern, Gordon.

20:49.944 --> 20:54.949
The master's dog, Blunder,
passed some weeks back.

20:57.386 --> 21:00.824
Then why keep the water fresh?

21:00.824 --> 21:05.481
Well, the master
was very fond of his dog,

21:05.481 --> 21:09.746
and I should think
he rather enjoyed the ritual
of tending to him.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.750
Now, if you'll follow me, please.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.099
Dinner will be served shortly.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.187
Oh, I can make my own--

21:16.187 --> 21:19.930
I must insist,
Miss Green, hmm?

21:19.930 --> 21:21.671
This is not your house.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.598
Oh, my!

21:35.598 --> 21:37.948
This must be
the old man's study.

21:46.696 --> 21:47.697
Adams.

21:49.395 --> 21:51.353
My name is Armstrong.

21:51.353 --> 21:54.269
Do not correct me, Adams,

21:54.269 --> 21:59.187
I am your boss, Lewis Findley!

22:00.754 --> 22:02.930
Yes, sir.

22:02.930 --> 22:07.848
I want you to buy me Seville.

22:07.848 --> 22:09.371
The whole city?

22:09.371 --> 22:11.025
The whole city!

22:11.025 --> 22:13.897
Very well. Done and done.

22:13.897 --> 22:16.378
And what should we do
with your new city, sir?

22:18.815 --> 22:20.513
Burn it to the ground.

22:22.123 --> 22:25.300
It is a place
where dreams go to die.

22:31.785 --> 22:35.963
Perhaps... there is something
else to be done.

22:37.573 --> 22:40.837
Because I know of a girl
who lives there,

22:40.837 --> 22:45.146
who is beautiful and kind.

22:47.061 --> 22:49.846
Maybe we can give her the city,

22:50.847 --> 22:53.981
so she can care for its people
in the manner they deserve.

23:02.946 --> 23:04.078
Hmm.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.562
- Oh, my Lord.
- Mm.

23:09.562 --> 23:10.867
Look at that.

23:12.391 --> 23:14.393
It's beautiful.

23:14.393 --> 23:16.873
It's, uh,
it's called a "katar."

23:16.873 --> 23:18.658
- Hmm.
- It's an ancient Tamil weapon.

23:19.746 --> 23:21.051
Hmm.

23:22.226 --> 23:23.880
Stunning, isn't it?

23:24.838 --> 23:25.926
Yes.

23:31.627 --> 23:33.194
Uh, right.

23:33.194 --> 23:34.630
After you, sir.

23:34.630 --> 23:36.676
Oh, why, thank you.

23:36.676 --> 23:40.723
The man shows up
at his hearing with one shoe.

23:40.723 --> 23:42.812
Well, I-I take one look at him
and I realize

23:42.812 --> 23:46.250
that this is an opportunity
to get the case thrown out.

23:46.250 --> 23:50.472
So, I tell the judge,
"Take a look at his feet."

23:50.472 --> 23:51.821
- I-I--

23:51.821 --> 23:54.607
You know, I literally hold
the man's foot up--

23:57.479 --> 23:59.481
- Shoe up and put--
- Come on, offer him water.

23:59.481 --> 24:02.919
- Oh!

24:05.356 --> 24:07.446
Oh, my goodness,
I'm terribly sorry, sir!

24:08.621 --> 24:09.796
Oh...

24:09.796 --> 24:13.147
It's, uh...
quite all right, dear.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.149
- Now, um, where was I?

24:15.149 --> 24:16.759
Uh, Katherine was it?

24:16.759 --> 24:18.544
Would you care to tell us
a bit about yourself?

24:18.544 --> 24:21.198
No...
- Or your time
working for Mr. Findley?

24:21.198 --> 24:22.286
Oh, thank Christ.

24:22.286 --> 24:25.376
Um... um...

24:28.075 --> 24:29.685
Oh, well, they can share, too.

24:29.685 --> 24:32.862
What a wonderful idea.
Please share, Katherine.

24:32.862 --> 24:35.691
Yeah, Katherine, share.

24:35.691 --> 24:39.521
I wanna hear how
he treats his people.

24:39.521 --> 24:42.437
Hopefully better
than you treated this pork loin.

24:44.874 --> 24:50.140
Mister-- Lord Findley
is kind to us.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.055
He treats us like family.

25:12.249 --> 25:13.947
Was it something I said?

25:34.228 --> 25:36.665
- Was that you? Screaming?

25:36.665 --> 25:39.799
No. What is going on?

25:39.799 --> 25:41.714
It's probably nothing.

25:41.714 --> 25:43.454
Stay in your room
while I check it out.

25:54.335 --> 25:56.424
What are you doing here?

25:58.731 --> 26:00.471
Same thing as you.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.909
Trying to figure out
what's going on here.

26:06.303 --> 26:11.004
Huh, Gordon. I was setting
for an explanation
for the power loss.

26:11.004 --> 26:13.310
Please, follow me.

26:25.888 --> 26:30.371
Ladies and gentlemen,
there is no cause for alarm.

26:30.371 --> 26:31.764
Well, why did the power go out?

26:31.764 --> 26:34.505
It appears the main switch
was flipped,

26:34.505 --> 26:36.638
but there is no reason
for alarm.

26:36.638 --> 26:39.119
There is no one else
on the island, I assure you.

26:42.296 --> 26:43.602
It was likely an animal.

26:46.213 --> 26:48.432
Regardless, I have fixed it,

26:48.432 --> 26:52.219
so there'll be no more
trouble or incidents tonight.

26:52.219 --> 26:54.308
Now, if you'll please
retire to your rooms.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.271
Hm.

27:03.883 --> 27:05.580
Miss Green, if you please.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.538
Gordon, has there been
any construction

27:07.538 --> 27:09.149
in this hallway recently?

27:09.149 --> 27:11.020
Not that I know of,
why do you ask?

27:11.020 --> 27:13.936
When the power went out,
I heard a woman scream.

27:13.936 --> 27:18.288
Well, your room
is not far from Miss Blanco.

27:18.288 --> 27:19.899
I should think
she had quite a start.

27:19.899 --> 27:22.684
You said the rooms
were soundproof.

27:22.684 --> 27:25.121
I suppose her window was open.

27:26.427 --> 27:27.907
Now, there'll be
no more questions.

27:27.907 --> 27:30.474
Would you please return
to your quarters?

27:30.474 --> 27:33.173
I won't leave the hall,
but I don't feel like
going back in there yet.

27:34.870 --> 27:36.742
Very good, miss.

29:27.548 --> 29:29.637
- You, too.
- Good morning.

29:32.118 --> 29:33.380
Good morning.

29:33.989 --> 29:35.208
Ah...

29:38.472 --> 29:41.605
I was about to go for a walk,
it's a lovely day out.

29:42.563 --> 29:43.564
Oh.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.405
Oh, God, yeah.

29:58.405 --> 29:59.885
I was actually just about
to go for a walk,

29:59.885 --> 30:01.756
if you'd care to join me.

30:03.584 --> 30:06.108
Or if you prefer to stay.

30:06.108 --> 30:09.329
Uh, yeah, I'm, uh,

30:09.329 --> 30:11.984
not much
of a breakfast guy.

30:11.984 --> 30:15.204
More of a coffee
and cigarettes for me.

30:15.204 --> 30:18.947
- Can we smoke in here?
- I'm... not sure.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.909
Right. Well, shall we?

30:23.909 --> 30:24.997
Please.

30:37.574 --> 30:38.837
So, what's your deal?

30:39.925 --> 30:42.101
I'm a florist from London.

30:42.101 --> 30:47.846
No, that's what you do,
or at least what
you say you do.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.804
What's your deal?

30:49.804 --> 30:53.547
I've been watchin' you.
You're smart.

30:53.547 --> 30:57.420
Not like that putz doctor,
the real kind.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.422
I see the things
other people miss.

30:59.422 --> 31:02.425
No, it's more than that.

31:03.557 --> 31:07.300
You put things together
in a way I've never seen before.

31:07.300 --> 31:09.215
At least not from a civilian.

31:09.215 --> 31:10.956
And yet that's all I am.

31:10.956 --> 31:14.437
Well, why not put your
detective skills to better use?

31:14.437 --> 31:17.484
Oh, it's just not a fitting
profession for a lady.

31:17.484 --> 31:19.878
There's not a place
at Scotland Yard for me.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.531
So, go private.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.927
You know, I knew a lady gumshoe
in California.

31:25.927 --> 31:28.843
She couldn't have been
more than 20 years old.

31:28.843 --> 31:31.759
Pretty little slip
of a thing, too.

31:31.759 --> 31:33.935
She was the best I've ever seen.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.807
I should like to have
your experiences, Mr. Walker.

31:38.940 --> 31:42.509
Trust me, you...
you don't want those.

31:43.379 --> 31:47.818
Speaking of experiences,
is it true you killed a man?

31:49.864 --> 31:54.216
You know, I thought you'd
have gotten to that sooner.

31:55.478 --> 31:57.611
Yeah, it's true.

31:57.611 --> 31:59.874
Look, I'm not proud of it.

32:00.744 --> 32:02.703
What happened?

32:02.703 --> 32:04.444
He was a, uh...

32:06.228 --> 32:10.363
he was a hotshot boxing
promoter out of Boston,

32:10.363 --> 32:14.758
and I was doin' a story
on the Irish mob

32:14.758 --> 32:17.761
and their connections
around the city.

32:17.761 --> 32:18.806
One night...

32:20.982 --> 32:23.724
One night, I see him,
and he's with his wife...

32:26.248 --> 32:29.077
and he starts beatin' on her,
somethin' fierce.

32:31.471 --> 32:34.430
And then he slipped,
hit his head.

32:37.042 --> 32:41.046
Cost me a hell of a story,
he would have killed her.

32:42.308 --> 32:43.831
I remember that story.

32:44.701 --> 32:46.616
Of course you do.

32:46.616 --> 32:50.403
You were let off
because none of the witnesses
would come forward.

32:50.403 --> 32:55.016
Yeah, well, like I said,
he slipped and hit his head,

32:55.016 --> 32:57.192
ten or so times.

33:01.327 --> 33:05.157
I think you're not
the terrifying brute
you try to present.

33:05.157 --> 33:09.552
Still, I would like
to avoid such situations.

33:09.552 --> 33:15.254
Listen, you gotta
get down into the muck
if you wanna find the truth.

33:15.254 --> 33:18.909
You can't have any fear
or limits

33:18.909 --> 33:21.216
to what you'll do
to find your answers.

33:23.697 --> 33:27.222
What I said to you yesterday,
that-that wasn't a threat.

33:27.222 --> 33:28.267
Then what was it?

33:29.398 --> 33:31.966
Call it a
"professional courtesy."

33:33.228 --> 33:36.492
Guys like Findley,
they-they got secrets

33:36.492 --> 33:38.799
they won't hesitate to protect.

33:38.799 --> 33:40.627
You don't care
for our host, do you?

33:41.802 --> 33:43.456
I've never met the man.

33:43.456 --> 33:44.718
Ah, just when I thought

33:44.718 --> 33:47.286
you were starting to show me
a little respect.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.505
You know,
the comments, the rants...

33:49.505 --> 33:51.551
you have an issue
with Lewis Findley

33:51.551 --> 33:53.901
that doesn't even
require his presence.

33:55.511 --> 33:56.991
You caught me.

33:56.991 --> 33:59.080
Then why come?

33:59.080 --> 34:02.040
Same as you.
I-I've got questions.

34:03.780 --> 34:06.218
I think we may not
find many answers.

34:07.306 --> 34:08.611
Maybe not.

34:10.961 --> 34:12.572
But guys like Findley,

34:12.572 --> 34:14.965
they don't do anything
without an angle.

34:15.792 --> 34:18.099
Hopefully, I can at least
figure that out.

34:18.099 --> 34:21.929
I know it has something
to do with us, but...

34:23.104 --> 34:24.062
Yeah.

34:26.064 --> 34:27.326
Me neither.

34:27.326 --> 34:28.544
Hmm.

34:32.157 --> 34:35.029
You know, yesterday,
I didn't mean to--

34:35.029 --> 34:36.117
Look!

34:52.568 --> 34:53.874
What the hell?

34:55.005 --> 34:57.269
There's one extra rabbit.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.706
Jesus. And?

35:01.969 --> 35:03.144
Oh, no, you don't.

35:03.144 --> 35:05.103
No, you're not
doin' that again.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.452
You can't dumb me up now.

35:06.452 --> 35:08.193
You know somethin',
I wanna hear what it is.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.195
You're gonna tell me.
Where are you going?

35:10.195 --> 35:11.718
Come on!

35:14.373 --> 35:15.939
Unbelievable.

35:17.202 --> 35:20.292
Alright,
what the hell is this?

35:20.292 --> 35:23.164
I think it means there's
someone here who doesn't belong.

35:23.164 --> 35:24.557
Yeah, well, I got my guess.

35:24.557 --> 35:26.298
Oh, she doesn't know anything.

35:26.298 --> 35:27.951
At least I don't think
she does.

35:27.951 --> 35:29.475
Explain that.

35:29.475 --> 35:32.173
Well, she could just as easily
be one of the five.

35:32.173 --> 35:36.786
All this does is confirm
that there's someone here
who's not who they say they are.

35:36.786 --> 35:40.877
It's games on top of games,
on top of games.

35:40.877 --> 35:42.792
And we're going to have
to play them all.

35:54.935 --> 35:56.763
How may I help you,
Mr. Armstrong?

35:57.938 --> 35:59.853
I think you can call me
"Phillip" at this point.

35:59.853 --> 36:02.421
Oh, no,
I am just a poor waitress

36:02.421 --> 36:04.553
and you a successful doctor.

36:04.553 --> 36:07.034
I know my place, Mr. Armstrong.

36:07.034 --> 36:08.818
I'm hardly rich.

36:08.818 --> 36:12.387
Hmm, you belong in this house
more so than I do, no?

36:12.387 --> 36:16.739
Now, chip-chop, what is it
that you are bothering me for?

36:16.739 --> 36:19.655
I was just about
to take a little nap
before lunch.

36:19.655 --> 36:22.223
It's, um, it's "chop-chop,"
not "chip-chop."

36:22.223 --> 36:26.140
Ah, so you've come
to insult my English.

36:38.283 --> 36:42.069
Well, if that is all,
I'd like to take my siesta now.

36:46.116 --> 36:47.683
Right.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.514
I think I'll have a walk.

36:53.950 --> 36:55.604
Yes, I'll have a walk.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.575
Alright, trust me.

37:09.575 --> 37:11.054
This is a bit strange.

37:11.054 --> 37:13.361
If he shows up, I'll eat a bug.

37:14.884 --> 37:17.496
Alright, what's going on here?

37:18.845 --> 37:23.719
Last night, you couldn't
get enough to eat or drink,

37:23.719 --> 37:28.681
and now you're sharing secrets
and barely eating, hmm?

37:29.856 --> 37:31.423
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

37:33.163 --> 37:34.774
Lord Findley is still grounded

37:34.774 --> 37:38.256
and weather conditions
have not improved as expected.

37:38.256 --> 37:41.563
As a result,
he will not be joining us today.

37:41.563 --> 37:42.956
Huh!

37:50.137 --> 37:51.791
What the bloody hell
are you doing?

37:52.487 --> 37:54.097
Whatever I want, Larry.

37:54.924 --> 37:57.275
Findley's not here
to stop me, is he?

37:58.493 --> 38:01.104
You're mad. He's mad.

39:44.599 --> 39:46.166
Something's happened.

39:50.997 --> 39:52.172
What's goin' on?

40:09.276 --> 40:10.799
- Is that--
- It's Lawrence.

40:11.713 --> 40:13.715
Kane. Kane.

40:16.457 --> 40:19.025
Oh, my God.
- How?

40:19.025 --> 40:21.941
Well, gee, let me guess.
He was stabbed.

40:21.941 --> 40:23.421
Kid, go and get the help.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.381
Why put the knife
in the tree?

40:27.381 --> 40:29.078
Maybe it was a message.

40:29.078 --> 40:31.080
Who could do such a thing?

40:31.080 --> 40:32.734
Someone very determined.

40:32.734 --> 40:35.128
And someone very strong.

40:35.128 --> 40:37.173
Miranda, where are you--
Oh, hell.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.965
You gonna swim for it?

41:32.577 --> 41:34.535
You know, you don't strike me
as the type of person

41:34.535 --> 41:37.320
to go sightseeing
while the rest of us get hunted.

41:38.408 --> 41:41.020
This is a nightmare.
The rabbits.

41:41.020 --> 41:42.108
I saw.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.240
What do we do?

41:46.895 --> 41:47.940
Use this, sweetheart.

41:48.767 --> 41:50.333
It's not enough, Donald.

41:50.333 --> 41:53.249
Yeah, well, the world's
full of disappointments.

41:53.249 --> 41:55.556
Look, I've been around.

41:55.556 --> 42:00.300
One thing I've learned
is you do what you gotta do
with what you got.

42:02.171 --> 42:03.869
What if I can't?

42:04.783 --> 42:07.481
Well, then we probably all die.

42:26.631 --> 42:28.633
We should gather in the lounge.

42:29.634 --> 42:30.939
Is that really a good idea?

42:30.939 --> 42:33.376
Yes, and it wasn't a request.

42:44.823 --> 42:46.172
Follow.

42:57.792 --> 42:59.925
Let me try once more
from the top.

43:01.187 --> 43:04.538
Phillip and Carmen
were in the east wing hall,

43:04.538 --> 43:09.282
Lu was in her room,
I was in the study,
Donald was outside,

43:09.282 --> 43:11.197
and the staff is still
all unaccounted for

43:11.197 --> 43:12.851
during the period
where the late Mr. Kane

43:12.851 --> 43:15.593
was being brutally murdered.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.421
As such, I have concluded
that we must treat everyone,

43:18.421 --> 43:20.119
myself included, as a suspect.

43:20.119 --> 43:22.948
- Now, hold on a second. You--
- No one has a valid alibi,

43:22.948 --> 43:24.776
it is the only logical
starting point.

43:24.776 --> 43:26.778
Phillip and I already said

43:26.778 --> 43:28.388
that we were together
in the hall.

43:28.388 --> 43:30.042
Did anyone else
verify this encounter?

43:30.042 --> 43:31.652
I'm sorry.
Is our word no good?

43:31.652 --> 43:33.915
Given the fondness
you two have for one another,

43:33.915 --> 43:36.439
it is equally as plausible
you would cover for each other

43:36.439 --> 43:39.094
as it is that you were together
in the east wing hall.

43:39.094 --> 43:41.923
Huh, she's got you there, kiddies.

43:42.968 --> 43:44.926
And what of you and the Yank?

43:44.926 --> 43:47.407
Don't think we haven't
all witnessed your conspiring?

43:47.407 --> 43:50.018
Which is why Mr. Walker
is atop my list of suspects.

43:50.018 --> 43:53.674
Wait, what?
You ungrateful--

43:53.674 --> 43:55.545
You were the closest
to the body.

43:55.545 --> 43:58.070
You are also
the most physically able
to overpower Lawrence.

43:58.070 --> 43:59.288
I barely knew the guy!

43:59.288 --> 44:02.378
Exactly.
We barely know each other,

44:02.378 --> 44:04.250
and you barely knew
the deceased.

44:04.250 --> 44:06.295
We must try to figure out
what connects us

44:06.295 --> 44:08.210
to understand
who has a true motive.

44:08.210 --> 44:12.650
Right now,
this is just conjecture
and baseless speculation.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.216
It would help
if we knew anything

44:14.216 --> 44:17.698
about the late Mr. Kane
as a start, anything at all.

44:22.007 --> 44:23.791
- Sean?
- Ma'am.

44:23.791 --> 44:26.489
Can you go look at the body?
Check his pockets.

44:26.489 --> 44:29.057
See if there's anything
that might help us know him
a little better.

44:30.450 --> 44:32.582
Yes, of course, ma'am.

44:34.497 --> 44:37.675
Wait, someone
should go with him.

44:39.328 --> 44:42.157
- I'll accompany Sean.
- Thank you, sir.

44:42.157 --> 44:44.899
Maybe someone not on the staff.

45:03.788 --> 45:04.789
I will go.

45:08.967 --> 45:10.446
Thank you, my dear.

45:12.840 --> 45:14.276
Well, alright.

45:15.625 --> 45:18.846
Now, sweetheart,
this should be good.

45:20.326 --> 45:24.765
What's the baseless
speculation about you?

45:24.765 --> 45:27.420
Ah, a delightful exercise.

45:27.420 --> 45:31.293
Well, I found
the deceased boorish.

45:31.293 --> 45:33.121
And I was the last person
in the study,

45:33.121 --> 45:35.428
where the dagger
resided on Findley's desk.

45:35.428 --> 45:39.693
Right now, we all have
conceivable opportunity
and equally likely motives,

45:39.693 --> 45:42.348
which is why
we can't rule anyone out.

45:43.828 --> 45:44.872
Including you.

45:55.709 --> 45:59.191
Miss Green,
I hardly think that's
an appropriate accusation.

45:59.191 --> 46:01.715
If we know little
about each other,
we know even less about them.

46:01.715 --> 46:03.282
And it was one of us killed!

46:03.282 --> 46:05.240
We mustn't resort
to tribal suspicions.

46:05.240 --> 46:08.374
I am merely asserting
that anyone of us
can be a suspect

46:08.374 --> 46:09.897
until we can gather
more information

46:09.897 --> 46:12.160
and begin
ruling individuals out.

46:13.379 --> 46:14.946
- The body is gone!
- What?

46:14.946 --> 46:16.991
Mr. Kane's body is missing.

46:16.991 --> 46:18.253
I think we all understood
the first time,

46:18.253 --> 46:20.342
but just to reiterate, what?

46:20.342 --> 46:22.605
Bodies do not just get up
and walk away.

46:22.605 --> 46:25.652
No, dear, they do not.
And I know from experience.

46:25.652 --> 46:27.567
I need to see this for myself.

46:34.139 --> 46:37.795
Okay. What did you do?

46:37.795 --> 46:39.709
What's going on?
Is the body there or not?

46:39.709 --> 46:41.537
- No.
- That's impossible.

46:41.537 --> 46:43.278
Not if she
and the old man moved it.

46:43.278 --> 46:46.499
Why and how would I
accomplish that, Mr. Walker?

46:46.499 --> 46:48.109
One mystery at a time.

46:48.109 --> 46:50.024
I still think they
had something to do with it.

46:50.024 --> 46:52.766
We must watch our insinuations
and accusations.

46:52.766 --> 46:56.248
Oh, now, we should
watch our insinuations?

46:56.248 --> 46:59.164
I'd like to know
where all of you were
at the time Kane was killed,

46:59.164 --> 47:01.819
and it would be
in your best interest
to tell us now.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.865
- Is that a threat, sir?
- I don't know, Jeeves, is it?

47:04.865 --> 47:06.388
Now, hold on,
this is ridiculous.

47:06.388 --> 47:09.348
We must not to let our emotions
get the best of us.

47:09.348 --> 47:11.437
May I make a suggestion?

47:11.437 --> 47:13.352
You haven't needed
permission thus far.

47:14.396 --> 47:16.703
Why don't we take
to our rooms until dinner?

47:16.703 --> 47:19.880
It's 5:00 now,
that's two and a half hours.

47:19.880 --> 47:22.578
That's plenty of time
for tempers to subside

47:22.578 --> 47:24.058
and then we can start
a conversation

47:24.058 --> 47:26.931
that's based on facts
and provable truths.

47:26.931 --> 47:28.889
What about us?

47:28.889 --> 47:31.152
Who is supposed
to prepare the meal?

47:31.152 --> 47:33.067
I don't feel safe
in the kitchen alone.

47:33.067 --> 47:36.331
Why don't we take heed
to travel in pairs or groups?

47:36.331 --> 47:39.247
- This is a good idea.
- Fine by me.

47:47.386 --> 47:49.170
Lock your doors!

47:49.170 --> 47:50.302
I need a drink.

47:50.302 --> 47:52.434
Refreshments can be
brought up, sir.

47:52.434 --> 47:54.523
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks.
- Of course.

47:54.523 --> 47:56.047
My dear, shall we?

48:00.094 --> 48:01.791
Well, that was a mistake.

48:01.791 --> 48:05.230
I don't remember you
asking for my loyalty.

48:05.230 --> 48:08.407
And, more importantly,
I don't remember
giving you mine.

48:08.407 --> 48:14.630
Yeah, well,
now you got no one
to watch your back, sweetheart.

48:26.425 --> 48:28.731
When the others
lock their doors,

48:28.731 --> 48:31.909
please come to my room.
I don't wanna be alone.

48:31.909 --> 48:35.347
Of course,
but we must be careful

48:35.347 --> 48:37.001
until we get off this island.

48:40.830 --> 48:42.832
Come on.

49:43.110 --> 49:45.547
I'm so scared.

49:45.547 --> 49:47.245
Findley will be here
in the morning,

49:47.245 --> 49:48.942
and we'll get to
the bottom of all this.

49:48.942 --> 49:50.509
There's nothing to fear.

49:50.509 --> 49:52.293
And what of us?

49:52.293 --> 49:55.775
We can leave and be together.

49:55.775 --> 49:57.385
You can visit me in London.

49:57.385 --> 49:59.431
London is dreary.

50:00.606 --> 50:02.260
Then I shall come to Seville.

50:03.435 --> 50:05.524
I hate Seville.

50:06.568 --> 50:09.354
Then we can go anywhere
in the world that you desire.

50:09.354 --> 50:13.662
And if you can't pick one place,
we'll go everywhere.

50:13.662 --> 50:16.970
It doesn't matter
so long as we're together.

50:18.058 --> 50:20.017
What a beautiful dream.

50:20.017 --> 50:21.714
Then let's make it real.

50:24.891 --> 50:28.242
Sometimes I forget
how young you are,

50:29.287 --> 50:31.376
how simple your life has been.

50:32.942 --> 50:34.118
What does that mean?

50:38.035 --> 50:40.298
Nothing, darling.

50:40.298 --> 50:42.735
Tell me more
about your beautiful dream.

50:58.229 --> 51:00.274
- What's wrong?

51:03.016 --> 51:05.105
It will all be over soon.

51:07.542 --> 51:09.718
Everything is going
as anticipated.

51:09.718 --> 51:10.763
Hmm.

53:13.407 --> 53:16.149
What? What?

53:16.149 --> 53:21.110
No. No! No! No! No!

53:46.701 --> 53:47.963
Where's Sean?

53:50.879 --> 53:52.838
Probably puttering
about somewhere.

53:54.883 --> 53:56.581
No, he's supposed to be here.

54:48.720 --> 54:50.287
This man is dead.

54:54.116 --> 54:55.901
Take the body to the lounge.

55:05.737 --> 55:08.392
Every contact leaves a trace.

55:12.439 --> 55:14.354
- Oh, that's odd.
- What?

55:14.354 --> 55:15.921
To whom does this belong?

55:18.053 --> 55:22.144
- Miss Wang, please follow me.
- Where are we going?

55:22.144 --> 55:24.538
You'll be spending
the rest of the night
locked in your room,

55:24.538 --> 55:27.106
and in the morning
you'll be turned over
to the proper authorities.

55:27.106 --> 55:28.629
I did not kill this man!

55:28.629 --> 55:31.066
Miss Wang,
don't make this any harder
than it needs to be!

55:31.066 --> 55:33.112
This is outrageous!

55:33.112 --> 55:35.549
Why would I kill this man?
How would I kill him?

55:35.549 --> 55:37.203
Sean was an old man.

55:37.203 --> 55:40.728
The killer did incapacitate him
by knocking him with the door.

55:40.728 --> 55:43.165
It's not outside the realm
of possibility.

55:43.165 --> 55:45.037
That's it, come along.

55:45.037 --> 55:47.953
No, wait! I'll be back
in less than an hour.

55:49.346 --> 55:50.782
Do not lock this woman up yet,

55:50.782 --> 55:53.654
or I'll have you arrested
for false imprisonment.

55:55.830 --> 55:56.831
Thought so.

55:58.093 --> 56:00.052
Wait! Where are you going?

56:00.052 --> 56:01.270
She's deranged.

56:01.270 --> 56:03.403
Nothing new on that front.

56:38.743 --> 56:41.049
I don't understand
how this is happening.

56:42.050 --> 56:43.356
I know, my dear.

56:44.879 --> 56:46.403
It's all very shocking.

56:47.186 --> 56:50.450
How can they just be dead?
It's only been one day.

56:50.450 --> 56:54.976
One day and two men
are just... dead.

56:54.976 --> 56:56.848
Dying ain't hard, sweetheart.

56:58.066 --> 56:59.677
Everybody does it.

57:10.252 --> 57:11.863
Meet Blunder.

57:12.690 --> 57:14.082
Findley's dog.

57:14.082 --> 57:17.564
- Findley's dead dog.

57:17.564 --> 57:20.393
- Not quite.
- Miss Green, what is
the meaning of all this,

57:20.393 --> 57:21.655
and what does it have to do
with the dog?

57:21.655 --> 57:23.527
I think we can drop that now.

57:25.964 --> 57:29.620
Everyone, meet Lewis Findley.

57:30.838 --> 57:31.839
What?

57:37.018 --> 57:38.019
How?

57:39.760 --> 57:42.633
Show, don't tell, Mr. Armstrong.

57:44.678 --> 57:45.940
See?

57:48.639 --> 57:51.293
Now, Gordon, be a dear
and open your coat.

57:57.038 --> 58:00.607
It would be improper
for a textile man
to dress beneath his station.

58:00.607 --> 58:02.043
Says who?

58:02.043 --> 58:05.046
Lewis Findley, before he
went underground in 1897.

58:05.046 --> 58:09.486
So, that's it?
That's your big reveal? A coat?

58:10.312 --> 58:12.793
No, that's just a taste.

58:19.757 --> 58:21.715
Watch your step,
careful now.

58:31.943 --> 58:35.816
Alright, you got us
all packed in here. Now, what?

58:35.816 --> 58:39.341
Right, well, in the hour
or so before dinner--

58:39.341 --> 58:40.952
You mean when we were
supposed to be cloistered.

58:40.952 --> 58:43.824
Oh, where's the fun in that,
Mr. Walker?

58:43.824 --> 58:47.262
I took the liberty
of taking a tour of the house
without a guide.

58:47.262 --> 58:52.311
It really is
an expansive property,
full of nooks and crannies.

58:52.311 --> 58:55.270
Plenty of places
to hide secrets.

58:55.270 --> 58:57.969
And that's when
I came upon this room.

58:57.969 --> 58:59.492
Now, I don't know
if you've noticed,

58:59.492 --> 59:02.539
but there are no photographs
or portraits in the house.

59:02.539 --> 59:05.629
Lewis Findley was apparently
a recluse of the highest order,

59:05.629 --> 59:08.806
who abhorred having his likeness
taken in any way.

59:08.806 --> 59:12.200
I'm sure that's what sparked
your interest, right,
Mr. Walker?

59:12.200 --> 59:14.812
Um, yeah.
Yeah, 'cause the old man,

59:14.812 --> 59:20.252
he was always using
an interme... intermediary.

59:20.252 --> 59:21.296
You.

59:22.384 --> 59:24.604
I knew--
I knew you from somewhere.

59:24.604 --> 59:29.478
This guy-- you were his stand in
at the meeting with Carnegie
in New York, weren't you?

59:31.263 --> 59:32.960
Which time?

59:32.960 --> 59:35.963
Mr. Carnegie was very fond
of his little events.

59:35.963 --> 59:39.750
There was always a banquet
or a dedication
that we mustn't miss.

59:39.750 --> 59:41.316
This is getting
a bit off topic.

59:41.316 --> 59:43.057
There'll be time enough
for that later.

59:43.057 --> 59:46.757
At the moment, we must continue
with the task at hand.

59:46.757 --> 59:50.674
His perceived aversion
to photographs
was not entirely accurate.

59:54.634 --> 59:58.159
Wow, the old man
really liked the mutt.

59:58.159 --> 1:00:01.728
Which is why he hid Blunder
in a small,

1:00:01.728 --> 1:00:03.817
though surprisingly
comfortable shack

1:00:03.817 --> 1:00:05.993
on the northernmost point
of the island.

1:00:05.993 --> 1:00:08.387
I saw it on my way
to the cliffs.

1:00:08.387 --> 1:00:11.738
Poor Blunder, he just
couldn't uphold the ruse.

1:00:11.738 --> 1:00:15.089
And that brings me
to my last surprise.

1:00:15.089 --> 1:00:17.396
If you'll all follow me
to the lounge.

1:00:17.396 --> 1:00:20.225
This behavior
seems a bit ghoulish
given the circumstances.

1:00:20.225 --> 1:00:22.053
I rather like it.

1:00:25.056 --> 1:00:27.493
Gettin' a little sick
of your games, old man.

1:00:33.804 --> 1:00:36.284
Alright, all settled?

1:00:36.284 --> 1:00:38.112
This better be good, sweetheart.

1:00:38.112 --> 1:00:42.377
Miranda, please,
there have been two murders.

1:00:42.377 --> 1:00:44.031
We are very afraid.

1:00:44.031 --> 1:00:47.861
No, you're right.
I have been a bit glib.

1:00:47.861 --> 1:00:50.777
The truth is a man has died,

1:00:50.777 --> 1:00:55.652
and it's a somber occasion,
traumatic even.

1:00:55.652 --> 1:00:58.132
But you are wrong on one count.

1:00:58.132 --> 1:00:59.699
You may come in.

1:01:09.753 --> 1:01:10.797
Hello all.

1:01:12.886 --> 1:01:15.715
Uh, terribly sorry
about the morbid theatrics.

1:01:15.715 --> 1:01:19.458
- I'm gonna kill you,
you no good son--
- Oh!

1:01:19.458 --> 1:01:20.720
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Let go!

1:01:20.720 --> 1:01:22.548
Mr. Walker.
No, no!

1:01:22.548 --> 1:01:26.334
What a big, twisted-- damn you--
I got it, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1:01:26.334 --> 1:01:27.945
Alright, let go. Alright.

1:01:29.468 --> 1:01:30.861
But you're gonna
answer some questions

1:01:30.861 --> 1:01:32.558
if you wanna
get off this island alive.

1:01:32.558 --> 1:01:35.474
That is, uh, more than fair,
all being all things considered,

1:01:35.474 --> 1:01:38.172
but if you'll allow me
to explain,

1:01:38.172 --> 1:01:41.698
you may find that I am not
completely deserving
of execution.

1:01:50.881 --> 1:01:54.449
Would anyone else care for one
before we begin?

1:01:54.449 --> 1:01:57.844
Yeah. I'll have one.

1:02:21.346 --> 1:02:23.609
Right, on with the show.

1:02:25.089 --> 1:02:28.745
Many months ago I was approached
by Lord Findley here

1:02:28.745 --> 1:02:32.531
with a rather strange proposition

1:02:32.531 --> 1:02:35.142
and an even stranger scheme.

1:02:36.448 --> 1:02:38.624
<i>Lord Findley valued his privacy</i>

1:02:38.624 --> 1:02:42.193
<i>above nearly all else,
that much is true.</i>

1:02:42.193 --> 1:02:44.804
<i>He never took a family,</i>

1:02:44.804 --> 1:02:47.894
<i>but that is not to suggest
he didn't seek</i>

1:02:47.894 --> 1:02:52.507
intimate companionship
in his day.

1:02:52.507 --> 1:02:57.599
In point of fact, Mr. Findley
was a bit of a lothario,
and believed himself

1:02:57.599 --> 1:03:00.602
<i>to have sired
a number of children,</i>

1:03:00.602 --> 1:03:04.650
<i>all of whom
could serve as his heirs
when the time came.</i>

1:03:05.869 --> 1:03:08.915
<i>And the hour
was approaching fast.</i>

1:03:10.743 --> 1:03:12.789
Lord Findley
was unwilling, however,

1:03:12.789 --> 1:03:16.314
to turn his immense fortune
over to a complete stranger,

1:03:16.314 --> 1:03:22.363
much less so to, as he put it,
an undeserving lout.

1:03:23.756 --> 1:03:27.455
The man really seemed
most invested

1:03:27.455 --> 1:03:30.154
<i>in what would happen
to his holdings
and his business.</i>

1:03:31.459 --> 1:03:35.594
<i>He made it very clear,
"One heir".</i>

1:03:35.594 --> 1:03:38.379
To the rest, well... phew.

1:03:39.337 --> 1:03:40.555
So, off I went.

1:03:47.867 --> 1:03:53.003
Five children deemed most fit
to inherit the immense fortune.

1:03:54.004 --> 1:03:56.571
Five invitations.

1:04:12.805 --> 1:04:17.114
But that was only the beginning,
for how was Findley to choose?

1:04:18.506 --> 1:04:21.379
Give the old man
credit for creativity.

1:04:21.379 --> 1:04:23.990
He hired a pair of actors,

1:04:23.990 --> 1:04:26.297
that he used from time to time
as surrogates,

1:04:26.297 --> 1:04:29.474
to play his staff
alongside himself,

1:04:29.474 --> 1:04:33.826
<i>as he would adopt the role
of the venerable butler Sean.</i>

1:04:35.436 --> 1:04:38.700
But how to provoke a person,

1:04:38.700 --> 1:04:41.965
to reveal their true nature
in but a short weekend,

1:04:41.965 --> 1:04:45.838
which Findley insisted
was all he needed
to choose an heir?

1:04:47.144 --> 1:04:50.887
<i>I suppose a murder
was as good a way as any.</i>

1:05:00.548 --> 1:05:04.248
The rest, the lights, and such,

1:05:04.248 --> 1:05:08.295
were all meant to invoke
tension and unease.

1:05:10.341 --> 1:05:13.518
And the rabbits?

1:05:15.389 --> 1:05:16.651
Rabbits?

1:05:16.651 --> 1:05:18.958
In the woods,
there's a small shack

1:05:18.958 --> 1:05:21.308
with five live rabbits,
one dead.

1:05:21.308 --> 1:05:22.962
They looked to represent us.

1:05:22.962 --> 1:05:26.748
Oh, I believe they were
just meant as fresh meat
for the dog.

1:05:27.662 --> 1:05:31.405
Sorry it isn't
a saucier reason, my dear.

1:05:31.405 --> 1:05:34.626
My employer was eccentric,
not insane.

1:05:34.626 --> 1:05:36.280
Yeah,
I don't see the difference.

1:05:37.237 --> 1:05:38.891
He wanted to test you.

1:05:40.414 --> 1:05:44.418
This, however,
wasn't part of the plan.

1:05:47.421 --> 1:05:52.035
Lord Findley
had fully intended to reveal
his selection tomorrow.

1:05:54.863 --> 1:05:58.737
I'm sorry, I truly am.

1:06:04.395 --> 1:06:07.180
Where are Gordon and Katherine?

1:06:07.180 --> 1:06:08.486
Who cares?

1:06:10.053 --> 1:06:11.358
They can't leave.

1:06:13.752 --> 1:06:15.145
About that.

1:06:15.145 --> 1:06:16.233
Hurry, dear!

1:06:16.233 --> 1:06:17.886
I'm trying!

1:06:17.886 --> 1:06:19.149
We must launch!

1:06:26.025 --> 1:06:29.159
Let him up, we'll come quietly!
Oh, do something!

1:06:29.159 --> 1:06:31.204
- He's going to kill him!
- Donald!

1:06:31.204 --> 1:06:33.250
Where were you going, huh?

1:06:33.250 --> 1:06:34.816
Donald, let him up right now,

1:06:34.816 --> 1:06:37.210
or I'll make sure you spend
the rest of your life in jail!

1:06:42.215 --> 1:06:43.695
Why run?

1:06:43.695 --> 1:06:46.828
Look, miss, it was a gig,

1:06:46.828 --> 1:06:48.917
and a bloody good one
at that, huh?

1:06:50.223 --> 1:06:51.964
Findley was a bit
of an odd fellow,

1:06:51.964 --> 1:06:54.967
bit cold as well,
but he took care of us,

1:06:54.967 --> 1:06:57.056
paid us well.

1:06:57.056 --> 1:07:00.233
We're not exactly
West End regulars.

1:07:00.233 --> 1:07:03.715
Acting gigs in London,
not exactly stable work,

1:07:03.715 --> 1:07:05.499
and we're not exactly
spring chickens.

1:07:05.499 --> 1:07:08.067
This isn't where
we thought we would end up,

1:07:08.067 --> 1:07:11.853
playing his staff,
being his emissaries.

1:07:13.029 --> 1:07:15.031
But it's been so hard.

1:07:15.031 --> 1:07:17.946
We've been married for 15 years
and what do we have
to show for it?

1:07:17.946 --> 1:07:22.081
No children,
nary a leading role between us,

1:07:22.081 --> 1:07:24.170
but these past few years,
working for Mr. Findley

1:07:24.170 --> 1:07:25.998
allowed us to buy a house
and start--

1:07:25.998 --> 1:07:27.652
You're not answering
the question.

1:07:27.652 --> 1:07:30.829
Yeah, because they don't
have an answer to the question,

1:07:30.829 --> 1:07:32.613
'cause they killed the old man.

1:07:32.613 --> 1:07:35.094
Trust me, I've seen plenty
of guilty people,

1:07:35.094 --> 1:07:37.140
and these two are guilty as sin.

1:07:37.140 --> 1:07:38.402
We didn't kill him!

1:07:38.402 --> 1:07:41.753
Look, let me explain.
This gig was different.

1:07:41.753 --> 1:07:44.582
Findley was very clear
that we should make no mistakes.

1:07:44.582 --> 1:07:48.934
He needed us to get the absolute
most out of each of you.

1:07:48.934 --> 1:07:52.372
We needed to poke, and prod,
and instigate

1:07:52.372 --> 1:07:55.897
as much as possible
without givin' up the game.

1:07:55.897 --> 1:07:59.988
And he was always there.
It was a lot of pressure.

1:07:59.988 --> 1:08:02.861
And then when the old man
turned up dead--

1:08:02.861 --> 1:08:04.167
You panicked.

1:08:04.167 --> 1:08:06.647
How were we going to
keep the house without...

1:08:08.867 --> 1:08:10.260
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:08:11.696 --> 1:08:14.090
You found and lost
a father today.

1:08:15.613 --> 1:08:16.962
It hardly compares.

1:08:20.574 --> 1:08:22.141
My father is Shen Wang,

1:08:23.403 --> 1:08:26.189
and he is alive and well
in China.

1:08:27.799 --> 1:08:31.150
Lewis Findley
may have known my mother,

1:08:31.150 --> 1:08:33.587
but he was not my father.

1:08:34.980 --> 1:08:36.982
Nor was he a father
to any of us.

1:08:38.766 --> 1:08:40.638
Not a real father, anyway.

1:08:46.600 --> 1:08:48.036
Thank you.

1:08:48.036 --> 1:08:50.387
Yeah, I don't buy it.

1:08:50.387 --> 1:08:52.650
So-so, let me get
this straight.

1:08:53.694 --> 1:08:55.609
The old man croaks,

1:08:55.609 --> 1:08:58.308
and the two of you decide
to take off in the boat,

1:08:58.308 --> 1:09:03.443
leave us stuck here
on the island, all 'cause
you got panicked, huh?

1:09:03.443 --> 1:09:05.228
I don't buy it. Not one bit.

1:09:06.664 --> 1:09:08.753
I haven't forgot
about you either, missy.

1:09:08.753 --> 1:09:10.102
You've been skulkin'
around the house

1:09:10.102 --> 1:09:12.365
since you got here
like you got somethin' to hide.

1:09:12.365 --> 1:09:13.801
And all of a sudden,
out of the blue,

1:09:13.801 --> 1:09:15.194
your scarf turns up

1:09:15.194 --> 1:09:17.153
wrapped around
a dead guy's neck!

1:09:17.153 --> 1:09:18.458
This is outlandish!

1:09:27.467 --> 1:09:31.471
Miss Green,
talk some sense into him.

1:09:31.471 --> 1:09:34.605
It is hard to understand
why you would come
all the way from China

1:09:34.605 --> 1:09:36.128
on little more
than an invitation.

1:09:36.128 --> 1:09:38.086
There you go. Thank you.

1:09:40.045 --> 1:09:41.786
You're not off the hook either, sweetheart.

1:09:41.786 --> 1:09:44.919
You're always walkin' around,
readin' your little
mystery books.

1:09:44.919 --> 1:09:47.661
Dreamin' of becomin'
a real detective one day.

1:09:47.661 --> 1:09:51.578
Then your dreams come true
and you get to solve
a real murder.

1:09:51.578 --> 1:09:52.927
Maybe you thought
the only thing

1:09:52.927 --> 1:09:56.192
better than solvin' one murder
is solvin' two, huh?

1:09:56.192 --> 1:09:59.107
Maybe that meant enough for you
to kill the old man yourself.

1:09:59.107 --> 1:10:01.893
Alright, this is
a reasonable enough theory.

1:10:01.893 --> 1:10:03.808
But there's more
connecting you to the murder.

1:10:03.808 --> 1:10:06.767
- Like what?
- You despise
the trappings of wealth,

1:10:06.767 --> 1:10:08.943
and we've already seen
the ferocity of your rage.

1:10:08.943 --> 1:10:11.032
Oh, there it is.

1:10:11.032 --> 1:10:13.339
Soon as chips are down,
you come after me every time.

1:10:13.339 --> 1:10:15.733
This is getting ridiculous.

1:10:15.733 --> 1:10:17.952
We know that someone
killed Mr. Findley.

1:10:17.952 --> 1:10:21.086
The impostors are suspects,
as well as Mr. Walker,

1:10:21.086 --> 1:10:24.176
Miss Green, and Miss Wang,
but we are talking in circles.

1:10:24.176 --> 1:10:27.875
I'd say that list
is a bit short, don't you?

1:10:27.875 --> 1:10:31.183
What are you implying,
Mr. Kane?

1:10:31.183 --> 1:10:33.664
I could never harm anyone.

1:10:40.323 --> 1:10:41.759
Phillip, tell them.

1:10:41.759 --> 1:10:44.501
It's unlikely.

1:10:44.501 --> 1:10:47.068
But you would do anything
to avoid returning to Seville.

1:10:49.201 --> 1:10:51.943
And what of you?
Are you not above suspicion?

1:10:51.943 --> 1:10:53.423
That's outrageous!

1:10:53.423 --> 1:10:55.425
I am a doctor.
My job is to help and heal.

1:10:55.425 --> 1:10:57.905
As though no doctor
has ever committed
nefarious deeds?

1:10:57.905 --> 1:10:59.820
What of your Jack the Ripper?

1:10:59.820 --> 1:11:01.779
Are there no theories
that he is a doctor?

1:11:01.779 --> 1:11:05.217
One baseless theory
implicates all doctors.
Brilliant. Well done.

1:11:05.217 --> 1:11:07.872
- What about H.H. Holmes?
- And Hawley Crippen.

1:11:07.872 --> 1:11:10.962
Burke and Hare sold bodies
to medical schools.

1:11:10.962 --> 1:11:12.877
Bodies that they stole
and murdered.

1:11:12.877 --> 1:11:14.357
Morality lessons from a lawyer,

1:11:14.357 --> 1:11:16.054
and a lawyer that took part
in this charade no less.

1:11:16.054 --> 1:11:17.621
That's very rich
coming from you, old boy.

1:11:17.621 --> 1:11:19.187
I suppose this was inevitable.

1:11:19.187 --> 1:11:21.668
But since we're all passing
blame around tonight,

1:11:21.668 --> 1:11:25.368
humor me, why would I kill
my employer, hmm?

1:11:25.368 --> 1:11:28.545
Maybe because
you're the only one
with access to the will.

1:11:28.545 --> 1:11:31.069
- What?
- If you could add one of us,

1:11:31.069 --> 1:11:33.027
you could just as easily
add yourself.

1:11:33.027 --> 1:11:34.899
You wouldn't even have
to take the whole fortune.

1:11:34.899 --> 1:11:37.423
You could just carve off
a little piece of the estate
for yourself.

1:11:37.423 --> 1:11:41.819
Well, considering I currently
don't have access to the will,
I'd say that's a faulty theory.

1:11:41.819 --> 1:11:43.821
How dare you?
You are the lawyer!

1:11:46.824 --> 1:11:48.565
Enough!

1:11:48.565 --> 1:11:50.393
This isn't getting us anywhere.

1:11:50.393 --> 1:11:53.483
We need to rest.
We'll call the police.

1:11:53.483 --> 1:11:55.354
They will handle this
in the morning.

1:11:55.354 --> 1:11:57.313
Good idea.

1:13:30.188 --> 1:13:31.319
What?

1:13:31.319 --> 1:13:32.799
I need you to come with me.

1:13:32.799 --> 1:13:34.932
I think that would be a bit daft
given the circumstances.

1:13:34.932 --> 1:13:37.543
Wouldn't you agree,
whatever your name is?

1:13:37.543 --> 1:13:39.415
Still Gordon.
That much is true.

1:13:40.241 --> 1:13:42.896
If I wanted you dead,
I could force my way in.

1:13:48.075 --> 1:13:49.686
I need to show you something.

1:13:53.733 --> 1:13:55.518
And why would I want to see it?

1:13:55.518 --> 1:13:57.694
Because I think
you can find the killer.

1:14:03.047 --> 1:14:07.312
You know, you had me worried
when we first met.

1:14:09.488 --> 1:14:12.404
Yeah, you seemed very skilled
at detecting a lie.

1:14:13.797 --> 1:14:16.582
But I suppose we all
have our parts to play.

1:14:21.152 --> 1:14:23.937
And there's only one thing
left to do at this point.

1:14:32.468 --> 1:14:34.034
Where is Miranda?

1:14:35.601 --> 1:14:37.342
Where's Gordon?

1:14:37.342 --> 1:14:40.606
He left in the night.

1:14:40.606 --> 1:14:43.087
He said he had to take care
of something in the study.

1:14:45.306 --> 1:14:46.351
Oh, no.

1:14:50.573 --> 1:14:52.096
Friends!

1:14:52.096 --> 1:14:54.751
Or should I say
brothers and sisters?

1:14:54.751 --> 1:14:56.056
Where's my husband?

1:14:56.056 --> 1:14:58.102
He's preparing the boat
for our departure.

1:14:58.102 --> 1:15:01.018
He took it a few hours ago
to fetch Detective Church here.

1:15:01.018 --> 1:15:04.543
Detective Harold Church,
Dartmouth constabulary. Pleasure.

1:15:04.543 --> 1:15:09.113
We have much to discuss.
There's a murderer in our midst.

1:15:09.113 --> 1:15:10.462
Aren't you being
a little cavalier?

1:15:10.462 --> 1:15:12.116
No reason for alarm, sir.

1:15:17.730 --> 1:15:20.603
Alright then, shall we?

1:15:50.458 --> 1:15:51.503
It is me.

1:15:53.026 --> 1:15:55.463
I can't be older than 14 here.

1:15:55.463 --> 1:16:00.425
He was watching us
all this time.

1:16:00.425 --> 1:16:03.254
That's just the tip
of the iceberg, I'm afraid.

1:16:17.224 --> 1:16:19.183
Gordon and Katherine
weren't lying

1:16:19.183 --> 1:16:21.141
when they said they were
keeping an eye on us.

1:16:22.273 --> 1:16:24.231
So, what in the hell
am I lookin' at?

1:16:27.583 --> 1:16:31.412
Cameras,
and expensive ones at that.

1:16:31.412 --> 1:16:34.459
Completely state-of-the-art,
in every room,

1:16:34.459 --> 1:16:36.635
with this nifty little feature
that logs footage

1:16:36.635 --> 1:16:39.333
- and replays it.
- Impossible.

1:16:43.250 --> 1:16:47.254
<i>Findley had connections
with both the American
and British military,</i>

1:16:47.254 --> 1:16:48.604
<i>very high up.</i>

1:16:48.604 --> 1:16:51.868
<i>One day the whole apparatus
just showed up</i>

1:16:51.868 --> 1:16:55.698
<i>with some very
serious-looking men in uniform.</i>

1:16:55.698 --> 1:16:57.613
<i>He showed me how to operate it,</i>

1:16:57.613 --> 1:17:00.746
<i>but he never said where
he obtained such technology.</i>

1:17:06.230 --> 1:17:08.232
I first suspected
something was off

1:17:08.232 --> 1:17:10.974
when I could hear Carmen
scream through the walls.

1:17:10.974 --> 1:17:14.978
Even if the claims
of soundproofing
were a lie meant to scare,

1:17:14.978 --> 1:17:18.242
a house as sturdy as this
should dampen the sound
a bit better,

1:17:18.242 --> 1:17:21.811
but Findley had a whole network
of hallways behind these walls.

1:17:21.811 --> 1:17:24.640
So, you saw the killer?

1:17:26.206 --> 1:17:28.469
This is ridiculous.
I'm leavin'.

1:17:28.469 --> 1:17:30.646
I'm afraid I can't let you
do that, my good man.

1:17:30.646 --> 1:17:31.908
I'm sure you understand.

1:17:31.908 --> 1:17:33.083
The surveillance yielded

1:17:33.083 --> 1:17:35.520
a treasure trove of information,

1:17:35.520 --> 1:17:38.218
but I'm sure
you'd all like some context.

1:17:41.787 --> 1:17:46.444
You know, working with roses,
one becomes desensitized
to such wounds,

1:17:46.444 --> 1:17:50.013
which I'm sure is something
that you have experienced,
Mr. Kane.

1:17:56.280 --> 1:17:57.934
Hazards of the job.

1:17:57.934 --> 1:18:03.287
And, Findley insisted on
rehearsing multiple scenarios

1:18:03.287 --> 1:18:06.899
before choosing exactly
how I was to be murdered.

1:18:08.248 --> 1:18:10.511
Your father's hands
weren't terribly steady.

1:18:14.646 --> 1:18:16.996
How could he
treat his friends so poorly?

1:18:16.996 --> 1:18:18.955
Men that rich
don't mix with staff.

1:18:18.955 --> 1:18:23.046
I should take offense,
but spot on, old boy.

1:18:24.656 --> 1:18:26.963
As I'm sure you know our father
was quite the traveler,

1:18:26.963 --> 1:18:29.748
and he made sure
to document his adventures,

1:18:29.748 --> 1:18:33.143
even his dalliances.
Liu Chan.

1:18:33.143 --> 1:18:34.797
My mother.

1:18:34.797 --> 1:18:36.363
Esme Blanco.

1:18:36.973 --> 1:18:38.017
And mine.

1:18:40.063 --> 1:18:41.194
Please don't.

1:18:43.370 --> 1:18:46.156
Naturally, my mother was here.

1:18:46.156 --> 1:18:47.984
But one name was missing.

1:18:47.984 --> 1:18:52.118
No Walkers, no Americans,
nothing of the sort.

1:18:52.118 --> 1:18:56.253
But there was one name
that appears again and again:
Shelby.

1:18:56.253 --> 1:19:00.648
She was the first,
a maid who worked on the estate,

1:19:00.648 --> 1:19:03.782
and apparently she left
quite an impact on Findley.

1:19:03.782 --> 1:19:07.699
The first few pages
are documented meticulously,

1:19:07.699 --> 1:19:09.832
and with a romantic fervor
that Findley

1:19:09.832 --> 1:19:13.009
seemed unable to access
for anything else in his life.

1:19:14.358 --> 1:19:17.796
Shelby and her child.

1:19:17.796 --> 1:19:23.933
For you see, the maid
had a child, a boy.

1:19:38.077 --> 1:19:40.558
Detective, will you check
his breast pocket?

1:19:41.689 --> 1:19:43.343
Steady now, big fellow.

1:20:02.623 --> 1:20:06.540
Yes. Shelby Walker
and Lewis Findley.

1:20:08.412 --> 1:20:10.588
I'm afraid
this doesn't prove much.

1:20:10.588 --> 1:20:12.590
Just wait.

1:20:22.382 --> 1:20:24.210
He said he'd marry her.

1:20:26.212 --> 1:20:27.823
Over and over and over.

1:20:30.216 --> 1:20:36.570
So, she waited, and waited
for him to tell his parents.

1:20:37.528 --> 1:20:40.052
She was young, she had time.

1:20:40.052 --> 1:20:41.967
But then she got pregnant...

1:20:45.057 --> 1:20:46.885
and that changed everything.

1:20:49.366 --> 1:20:53.152
Said he had no choice
but to fire her.

1:20:55.720 --> 1:20:58.592
And she got-- she got nothing...

1:21:00.899 --> 1:21:04.033
because payouts raise questions.

1:21:07.036 --> 1:21:10.082
So, she had--
she had nowhere to go.

1:21:12.737 --> 1:21:15.218
Her own family
wouldn't let her in,

1:21:15.218 --> 1:21:20.701
because she was unmarried
and carrying a...

1:21:22.007 --> 1:21:25.881
a bastard son.

1:21:25.881 --> 1:21:29.885
So, she moved to the States.

1:21:32.017 --> 1:21:33.758
She had me on the boat.

1:21:35.238 --> 1:21:37.022
She always clung to this hope

1:21:37.022 --> 1:21:42.071
that... that one-day Findley
would come for her.

1:21:43.811 --> 1:21:46.553
We would live
in the lap of luxury.

1:21:47.990 --> 1:21:51.602
She refused to find
any permanent work,

1:21:51.602 --> 1:21:56.999
because she was sure
that any day now,
her prince would come.

1:21:56.999 --> 1:22:00.045
She'd say,
"Daddy will come save us."

1:22:03.396 --> 1:22:04.702
Daddy.

1:22:08.010 --> 1:22:09.489
Then she got sick.

1:22:12.710 --> 1:22:16.888
So sick that she swallowed
her pride and she...

1:22:16.888 --> 1:22:23.547
she wrote Findley a letter,
begging for help.

1:22:26.942 --> 1:22:28.944
Not a word.

1:22:31.120 --> 1:22:32.904
And she made sure
that I knew the truth

1:22:32.904 --> 1:22:36.560
about Findley before she died.

1:22:36.560 --> 1:22:39.171
And when her day came...

1:22:40.956 --> 1:22:43.175
that was there
that I vowed that...

1:22:45.351 --> 1:22:48.006
I would come after Findley

1:22:48.006 --> 1:22:51.009
and everyone like him
for the rest of my life.

1:22:54.273 --> 1:22:56.058
See, the rich and powerful,

1:22:56.058 --> 1:23:01.715
they know that information
can do more harm

1:23:01.715 --> 1:23:06.111
than any-any knife or pistol.

1:23:06.111 --> 1:23:09.245
So, I became
a hunter of secrets.

1:23:11.203 --> 1:23:14.119
I would find their sins
and I would drag 'em out

1:23:14.119 --> 1:23:17.905
into the cold light of day
for everyone to see.

1:23:17.905 --> 1:23:20.082
He watched your every move.

1:23:27.611 --> 1:23:28.786
Those...

1:23:32.224 --> 1:23:33.878
those are my stories.

1:23:33.878 --> 1:23:37.055
It's all in the journal.
He was terribly proud of you.

1:23:38.448 --> 1:23:40.493
He didn't care much
for your politics,

1:23:40.493 --> 1:23:42.974
but your drive,
your relentlessness.

1:23:42.974 --> 1:23:45.542
You were everything
he wanted in an heir,

1:23:45.542 --> 1:23:47.152
'cause you were just like him.

1:23:47.152 --> 1:23:49.546
I was nothing like him!

1:23:49.546 --> 1:23:51.156
I mean, look around.

1:23:51.156 --> 1:23:55.378
He just left us all
to struggle and survive,

1:23:55.378 --> 1:23:58.076
while he watched us
from his gilded towers.

1:23:58.076 --> 1:24:02.254
And at any time, he could have
eased our suffering, but, nope.

1:24:03.951 --> 1:24:06.041
He has let us twist
in the wind.

1:24:07.564 --> 1:24:11.220
And then when that time
came in his life

1:24:11.220 --> 1:24:13.700
to do the right thing
and let us in...

1:24:17.356 --> 1:24:18.705
more games.

1:24:22.405 --> 1:24:27.366
So, I did the one thing
that that man, that--

1:24:27.366 --> 1:24:31.979
that coward didn't have
the decency to do.

1:24:31.979 --> 1:24:33.459
I stopped the game.

1:24:34.895 --> 1:24:36.332
By killing him?

1:24:36.332 --> 1:24:38.203
By doing what was necessary.

1:24:38.203 --> 1:24:39.509
By framing me.

1:24:40.901 --> 1:24:43.774
By blaming Gordon, then Miranda,
and when that didn't work,

1:24:43.774 --> 1:24:45.950
making sure we blamed
one another,

1:24:45.950 --> 1:24:47.908
so that you could slip away.

1:24:50.215 --> 1:24:53.349
You are the real coward!

1:24:53.349 --> 1:24:54.567
Well...

1:24:56.091 --> 1:24:59.355
I guess I got a bit
of the old man in me after all.

1:25:04.229 --> 1:25:06.405
But y'all should be thanking me.

1:25:07.972 --> 1:25:10.888
I set you free.
That money is cursed.

1:25:10.888 --> 1:25:13.325
For four of us,
there is the utter degradation

1:25:13.325 --> 1:25:15.675
of being told to our face
by Findley

1:25:15.675 --> 1:25:17.024
that we're just not good enough.

1:25:19.244 --> 1:25:22.987
And then for
the one lucky winner...

1:25:25.163 --> 1:25:29.254
it's a worse fate
to be locked in a cage

1:25:29.254 --> 1:25:33.258
and turned into a cheap
facsimile of him.

1:25:33.258 --> 1:25:35.173
That's not exactly true.

1:25:35.173 --> 1:25:37.523
This was never a game
of choosing.

1:25:38.916 --> 1:25:40.831
This was due diligence.

1:25:40.831 --> 1:25:42.833
It was always
going to be you, Donald.

1:25:43.877 --> 1:25:46.445
This was just a test to vet you.

1:25:46.445 --> 1:25:48.621
We were never serious options.

1:25:48.621 --> 1:25:51.581
And now, it will be no one.

1:25:52.886 --> 1:25:55.759
The inheritance
should be divided equally

1:25:55.759 --> 1:25:57.761
amongst his children.
Is that not the law?

1:25:57.761 --> 1:26:01.243
Possibly, but the will
was very specific

1:26:01.243 --> 1:26:03.549
that should an heir
not be chosen,

1:26:03.549 --> 1:26:06.378
all assets would be returned
to Findley Industries

1:26:06.378 --> 1:26:09.164
and a successor
be appointed by the board.

1:26:09.164 --> 1:26:15.866
If an heir were chosen, however,
all would be well taken care of.

1:26:15.866 --> 1:26:18.956
Though you'd be forced to
relinquish your names,

1:26:18.956 --> 1:26:22.220
sworn to secrecy under threat
of losing your buyouts.

1:26:22.220 --> 1:26:24.483
Games on top of games.

1:26:25.528 --> 1:26:27.269
Take him away, Detective.

1:26:51.206 --> 1:26:52.990
I'm terribly sorry.

1:26:52.990 --> 1:26:56.254
Had I known the depths
of his sadism,

1:26:56.254 --> 1:26:59.039
I never would have partook.

1:26:59.039 --> 1:27:01.128
He would have found
someone else.

1:27:05.872 --> 1:27:08.484
Our father
does not define our worth,

1:27:08.484 --> 1:27:10.268
nor does our station.

1:27:10.268 --> 1:27:13.228
We are the masters
of our own fate.

1:27:15.273 --> 1:27:19.756
- We don't need him.
- Or his money.

1:27:19.756 --> 1:27:21.584
Because we have each other.

1:27:41.517 --> 1:27:43.301
What's going to happen to him?

1:27:43.301 --> 1:27:45.129
It should be
an open and shut case.

1:27:45.129 --> 1:27:47.218
He'll spend the rest
of his life in a cell.

1:27:47.218 --> 1:27:48.567
What a waste.

1:27:48.567 --> 1:27:52.049
Oh, you're too kind.

1:27:52.049 --> 1:27:54.878
And that's why you'll never be
a detective, sweetheart.

1:27:54.878 --> 1:27:57.707
That compassion
is why I caught you,

1:27:57.707 --> 1:27:59.752
and it's why
I'll catch more like you.

1:28:00.753 --> 1:28:02.407
And don't call me "sweetheart."

1:28:02.407 --> 1:28:04.453
Be seein' you, sis.

1:28:06.368 --> 1:28:10.850
Miss, wait.
You've got a gift for this.

1:28:10.850 --> 1:28:12.504
If you ever need a hand
getting started,

1:28:12.504 --> 1:28:14.245
I have mates at Scotland Yard.

1:28:14.245 --> 1:28:16.769
Oh, thank you.

1:28:16.769 --> 1:28:19.598
But I think my services
are better utilized on my own.

1:28:19.598 --> 1:28:21.905
Oh, like a private detective?
Uh, the money--

1:28:21.905 --> 1:28:24.560
Oh, I've never had
much use for money,

1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:28.651
but I would like to be
of service to people
who truly need it.

1:28:28.651 --> 1:28:30.566
Still, I'll take this.

1:28:30.566 --> 1:28:32.916
Even a good detective
needs help from time to time.

1:28:32.916 --> 1:28:34.352
Right you are, miss.

1:28:34.352 --> 1:28:35.701
And I'll make sure
the world knows

1:28:35.701 --> 1:28:37.790
that the woman who found
Lewis Findley's killer

1:28:37.790 --> 1:28:39.009
is open for business.

1:28:39.009 --> 1:28:40.750
Thank you, sir.

1:28:44.275 --> 1:28:46.799
I was thinking about us.

1:28:47.365 --> 1:28:48.758
As was I.

1:28:50.063 --> 1:28:52.283
Just because
we can't be together,

1:28:52.283 --> 1:28:54.720
doesn't mean we can't be
in each other's lives.

1:28:57.070 --> 1:28:59.377
I've never had
a little brother before.

1:28:59.377 --> 1:29:02.467
- I'm not that young.

1:29:02.467 --> 1:29:05.209
Darling, it's a joke.

1:29:14.436 --> 1:29:16.438
I suppose he abandoned you, too.

1:29:18.440 --> 1:29:21.660
Well, why don't you join
our collection of lost things?

1:29:21.660 --> 1:29:23.358
We need to look out
for each other.
