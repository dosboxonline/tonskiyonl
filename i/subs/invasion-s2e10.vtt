WEBVTT

00:54.930 --> 00:56.098
Am I normal?

00:59.393 --> 01:01.353
Your pulse is irregular.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.857
Brain activity, inconclusive--

01:04.857 --> 01:06.191
That's not what I asked.

01:09.194 --> 01:10.279
I can feel it.

01:11.864 --> 01:12.906
Their language.

01:14.616 --> 01:15.909
It's filling my mind.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.412
Let's take it one step at a time.

01:20.831 --> 01:23.333
What do you remember
from your trip into the jungle?

01:24.835 --> 01:26.378
I wasn't in the jungle.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.130
I found you, Mitsuki.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.424
You'd wandered out there all alone.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.800
I wasn't in the jungle.

01:34.761 --> 01:35.762
I was in them.

01:38.140 --> 01:41.476
I remember following their voices,

01:42.853 --> 01:44.313
digging for the light.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.359
Looking over the world.

01:50.986 --> 01:51.987
The mother ship.

01:52.863 --> 01:54.406
That's where the portals go.

01:55.908 --> 02:01.163
If I can learn to control them,
we can send people through.

02:02.831 --> 02:03.874
I have to go again.

02:04.499 --> 02:06.710
To be repeatable,
an action requires memory.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.464
Can you honestly say yours is intact?

02:29.942 --> 02:31.610
What the hell is this place?

02:31.610 --> 02:33.779
Hell is definitely the right word for it.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.324
Billy?

02:38.450 --> 02:39.451
Can you hear me?

02:41.370 --> 02:42.371
Is he family?

02:43.580 --> 02:44.581
Something like that.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.547
The General said
that they were returned this way.

02:54.049 --> 02:55.676
Returned? You mean...

02:59.304 --> 03:00.556
Jesus.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.184
Felix?

03:09.273 --> 03:10.566
Nels?

03:14.611 --> 03:15.612
Dolores?

03:19.658 --> 03:20.909
Are there any more down here?

03:20.909 --> 03:23.871
Nah, this is it.
They're just running tests on them.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.706
To see why they were sent back at all.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.837
To hell with that.
You're going home, Billy.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.381
All of you.

03:34.882 --> 03:38.135
Rose, they're not going home.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.053
Look at them.

03:41.847 --> 03:44.600
Dig deep! Fortify position. Move out!

03:47.060 --> 03:49.229
I'll keep watch. We need to move out.

03:51.440 --> 03:55.110
I made a promise to everyone
who stopped by the station, who called.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.029
I swore I would do whatever it took.

03:57.613 --> 03:59.281
Every face on every poster.

03:59.281 --> 04:01.909
Yeah, and now you know where they are.
And you're gonna tell them.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.243
Tell them what?

04:04.536 --> 04:05.746
That I left 'em?

04:07.456 --> 04:11.043
But you know well as anyone
what it's like to live with loss.

04:11.043 --> 04:14.129
Wouldn't you have given anything
to see your son again?

04:17.257 --> 04:18.257
Not like this.

04:20.636 --> 04:23.722
Right now, the people out there,
the people that you promised,

04:23.722 --> 04:24.932
they got what I don't.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.269
Hope. Something to fight for.

04:29.978 --> 04:33.982
You can't bring their loved ones back
looking like this. All right?

04:33.982 --> 04:35.442
And at the very least they can be here,

04:35.442 --> 04:37.236
and somebody can figure out
and try to help them.

04:37.236 --> 04:39.821
But in the meantime, you and I,
we need to go back out there,

04:39.821 --> 04:42.282
and we gotta help the ones
who actually need it.

04:46.537 --> 04:47.746
Goddamn it.

04:50.374 --> 04:55.170
We are coming back here, Trev.
And when we do--

04:55.170 --> 04:56.547
They're all going home.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.885
Hey. We gotta move, now!

05:04.680 --> 05:05.681
Let's go.

05:21.780 --> 05:22.990
Drop your weapons!

05:28.996 --> 05:29.997
On your knees!

05:31.999 --> 05:34.793
- We don't want any trouble.
- Shut up! On your knees!

05:39.840 --> 05:40.841
Slide 'em forward.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.891
I got two escaped prisoners--

05:52.978 --> 05:54.730
Hey, back it up!

05:55.939 --> 05:57.107
Get on your knees now.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.526
Come on, get on your knees!
Get on your knees!

06:05.282 --> 06:06.909
- You good?
- Yeah.

06:07.743 --> 06:08.952
Thanks.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.913
Thank me when we're out of here.

06:10.913 --> 06:13.332
<i>I've managed to go back...</i>

06:13.832 --> 06:15.959
<i>And each time I've gone,
I've gotten a better sense of it.</i>

06:15.959 --> 06:17.669
<i>We were hoping you could create a map.</i>

06:17.669 --> 06:20.756
<i>I tried to make one
by working with the other kids.</i>

06:20.756 --> 06:23.258
<i>Everyone's experience
of the alien world is different.</i>

06:23.258 --> 06:24.843
- Can't be.
- But you think you now know

06:24.843 --> 06:26.094
<i>where you've been traveling to?</i>

06:26.094 --> 06:28.180
<i>Drawing it out
wouldn't make sense for anyone.</i>

06:28.180 --> 06:29.389
I'll catch up.

06:30.933 --> 06:33.310
But I was there less than an hour ago.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.603
Look, I don't know how, okay?

06:34.603 --> 06:38.899
But I've-- I've been traveling
to the mother ship.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.485
That's why I called this meeting, General.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.487
The information Caspar has gathered,

06:43.487 --> 06:45.489
the maps he's made
with the other children,

06:45.489 --> 06:46.865
all paint a picture of that ship.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.451
<i>The question is how do we strike it?</i>

06:49.451 --> 06:50.536
<i>There's a light.</i>

06:51.578 --> 06:52.829
<i>There's a light up there.</i>

06:53.455 --> 06:54.957
<i>Brighter than the rest.</i>

06:54.957 --> 06:57.918
And they don't want me to get to it
but I can see it.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.337
And I think it connects them, all of them.

07:01.338 --> 07:02.589
So if we hit them--

07:02.589 --> 07:03.924
We hit all of them.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.968
<i>Okay, let's say
the kid can get back up there.</i>

07:05.968 --> 07:10.097
The portal here in Idabel usually returns
people to the same place: the crater.

07:10.806 --> 07:14.643
And as for picking them up, how
and where is random, it's unpredictable.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.687
Even if we could find it,

07:16.687 --> 07:19.648
we wouldn't know how to control it
long enough for my men to enter safely.

07:19.648 --> 07:22.860
<i>I hope our team in the Amazon
can help answer that question.</i>

07:22.860 --> 07:24.820
<i>One of them was up there with Caspar.</i>

07:25.320 --> 07:26.905
<i>They'll be updating me shortly.</i>

07:27.656 --> 07:30.701
The areas of our planet fit
for human habitation have shrunk.

07:32.286 --> 07:34.371
Hunter-killers are decimating our forces.

07:35.289 --> 07:38.125
There is nowhere else left
for us to run in our world.

07:39.418 --> 07:43.005
<i>So we need to take this war
to their world.</i>

07:43.505 --> 07:44.715
Caspar?

07:49.011 --> 07:50.012
Trevante?

07:53.849 --> 07:55.017
Caspar the Ghost.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.478
I wanna see your hands in the air,
right now!

09:22.855 --> 09:24.022
I gave you an order!

09:24.022 --> 09:26.733
- Wait, w-w-w-wait. No, I-- I know him.
- General, who is this?

09:26.733 --> 09:29.111
I'm Trevante Cole,
former US Navy SEAL, ma'am.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.779
Current prisoner
for breaking into this base.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.364
I'm sorry, Madam President.

09:32.364 --> 09:33.657
We had an incident today

09:33.657 --> 09:35.826
<i>which is why Chief Cole was
in confinement.</i>

09:35.826 --> 09:37.995
Permission to return
the prisoner to his cell?

09:37.995 --> 09:39.663
<i>No. I know Trevante. Okay?</i>

09:39.663 --> 09:41.623
He-- He helped me back in London.

09:42.291 --> 09:46.044
He took me to the hospital,
and he risked his life to save mine.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.921
I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for him.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.214
I thought I lost you.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.467
Yeah, you almost did.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.262
Jamila...

09:55.262 --> 09:57.389
- She found me.
- She made it too.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.308
- Madam President, please?
- General,

09:59.308 --> 10:01.310
tell your men to stand down.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.020
Let us hear what he has to say.

10:04.897 --> 10:06.732
<i>How did you find our base in Idabel?</i>

10:07.649 --> 10:10.110
Caspar, he led me here.

10:11.486 --> 10:14.031
His drawings, his book.

10:14.031 --> 10:15.240
You still have it?

10:15.240 --> 10:17.868
It's the only thing I hung on to
this whole time.

10:22.164 --> 10:24.541
It kept me-- It kept me going.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.002
It led me to this town, this base.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.717
It was all in your book.

10:35.302 --> 10:36.970
<i>And everyone thought I was crazy.</i>

10:39.014 --> 10:40.098
<i>And now you're there.</i>

10:41.934 --> 10:42.935
I'm here.

10:45.604 --> 10:46.855
I knew it.

10:46.855 --> 10:48.023
<i>Knew what?</i>

10:48.023 --> 10:49.775
I knew this was all for a reason.

10:56.615 --> 10:59.117
I heard you saying you're gonna go
to the mother ship with Caspar.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.661
If you're sending soldiers, I'm in.

11:00.661 --> 11:03.497
This is not Afghanistan, son.
This is no ordinary mission.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.040
Exactly. If you send soldiers up there

11:05.040 --> 11:06.875
who don't know how he thinks
or how he works,

11:06.875 --> 11:08.544
you are sending the wrong weapons to war.

11:12.256 --> 11:15.008
Ma'am, I'm the one.
The only one for this mission.

11:15.551 --> 11:16.927
<i>I trust him with my life.</i>

11:16.927 --> 11:19.638
<i>I appreciate that. But I do not.</i>

11:19.638 --> 11:22.099
<i>We've worked too hard,
too long to hand this mission</i>

11:22.099 --> 11:23.350
<i>to someone we can't control.</i>

11:23.350 --> 11:25.435
You got a town
full of soldiers you can control.

11:25.435 --> 11:27.229
And I got through damn near all of them.

11:27.229 --> 11:29.481
<i>That further proves
your lack of respect for authority.</i>

11:29.481 --> 11:32.985
<i>So, you can go back to your cell
or you can go home.</i>

11:32.985 --> 11:34.403
<i>Those are your options.</i>

11:39.491 --> 11:40.701
I'm not walking away from this.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.412
<i>Then you'll be walked back
to your cell. General!</i>

11:43.412 --> 11:44.955
No. No, wait!

11:44.955 --> 11:46.582
<i>Time is not one of our luxuries.</i>

11:46.582 --> 11:48.500
<i>Say your goodbyes and say them now.</i>

11:51.670 --> 11:53.589
Guess we never did get to say goodbye.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.723
Good luck.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.642
<i>You too.</i>

12:35.255 --> 12:37.341
You-- You all right?

12:42.930 --> 12:44.556
He doesn't want me to go under.

12:46.225 --> 12:48.185
He doesn't even want me to try.

12:51.563 --> 12:52.814
Maybe he cares about you.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.526
More than anything, even himself.

12:55.526 --> 12:57.569
I didn't come all this way to stop now.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.407
He needs me up there.

13:05.536 --> 13:08.038
Yeah. And what if we need you down here?

13:10.123 --> 13:13.752
Look, I'm just saying, right--

13:14.920 --> 13:16.380
I mean, look at the drawing.

13:16.380 --> 13:21.134
I've looked at it hundreds of times.
Thousands. What of it?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.762
Yeah, okay, right.
That's supposed to be you. Yeah?

13:24.346 --> 13:25.597
And Casp here?

13:25.597 --> 13:28.183
He's on one planet
and you're on the other.

13:29.685 --> 13:31.311
You told me Caspar knows what's coming.

13:31.311 --> 13:35.274
His-- His drawings are
the-- the answer, or clue, or whatever.

13:35.274 --> 13:38.360
So, why would this be different?

13:39.903 --> 13:42.614
Why would he draw something
unless it was meant to be?

13:57.880 --> 14:01.300
Sometimes, you stare at something
long enough,

14:02.634 --> 14:04.261
you see what you want to see,

14:05.387 --> 14:08.015
what you-- what you wish it could be.

14:10.642 --> 14:11.768
Doesn't make it real.

14:13.187 --> 14:15.147
No matter how much you wish it was.

14:16.857 --> 14:18.066
Monty.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.905
Look, I'm-- Look, I'm just saying
that we need you.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.699
The world needs you.

14:26.867 --> 14:27.868
That's all.

14:44.343 --> 14:46.303
So, you don't know if Aneesha found Sarah?

14:46.303 --> 14:47.596
We got separated.

14:47.596 --> 14:50.140
But if I got out,
there is a chance she did too.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.101
- Anything?
- We've tried all the bands.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.561
Rachel, Rudi, Aneesha.

14:55.437 --> 14:56.438
Keep trying.

14:56.980 --> 15:00.651
- They could have their walkies off or--
- I'm telling you we're the only ones left.

15:00.651 --> 15:04.029
- Everyone else is either captured or--
- You don't know that. Okay?

15:04.029 --> 15:05.280
We just have to keep up hope.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.157
Maybe we need to be realistic here, Clark.

15:07.157 --> 15:09.159
What we need to do is get outta Idabel.

15:09.159 --> 15:11.411
We can't just leave
without Sarah and Aneesha.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.873
- They're in the facility.
- And that facility is on high alert.

15:14.873 --> 15:17.584
They're looking for us. Listen.

15:17.584 --> 15:20.712
We got Aneesha here.
And we've bled to do it.

15:20.712 --> 15:25.342
Best we can do now is hope she's
with Sarah and figure out our next move.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.426
Clark.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.138
I got this off of one of those soldiers,
all right?

15:30.138 --> 15:33.100
It's a bit busted up
but maybe we can use it to listen in.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.395
I'll see if I can get it working.

15:39.064 --> 15:43.026
But just so you all know,
when the coast is clear, I'm gone.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.821
Anyone who wants to join is welcome.

16:28.906 --> 16:29.907
No!

16:44.213 --> 16:45.964
Time's running out, Miss Malik.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.299
We've got at best a handful of clues

16:47.299 --> 16:49.218
as to what these aliens are
and how to beat 'em.

16:49.218 --> 16:51.011
And that shard is one of them.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.388
You did everything you could
to hang on to it.

16:53.388 --> 16:54.848
You must know how it works.

16:55.641 --> 16:57.601
Please, give me some help here.

16:58.227 --> 17:00.062
Your men took my daughter.

17:00.062 --> 17:02.272
And I can see that you love her very much.

17:03.232 --> 17:05.608
So, tell me what have you done
to keep Sarah alive?

17:06.777 --> 17:08.694
- Excuse me?
- Since the invasion started.

17:08.694 --> 17:11.490
Did you take from people?
Lie to them? Worse?

17:11.490 --> 17:14.660
Yes. I did. For my family.

17:14.660 --> 17:17.037
Well, I have millions of families
to keep alive.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.373
And that makes it okay
to take a child away from her mother?

17:19.373 --> 17:21.708
Not okay. Just necessary.

17:21.708 --> 17:23.417
If it could mean winning a war...

17:24.461 --> 17:26.421
What I'm saying, Miss Malik, is that

17:26.421 --> 17:29.216
when you're fighting with monsters,
and believe me, we are,

17:29.216 --> 17:31.301
sometimes you have to do things that seem...

17:31.301 --> 17:32.594
Monstrous.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.058
Please.

17:42.855 --> 17:44.565
It kept me and my family safe.

17:45.816 --> 17:47.234
That's why I held on to it.

17:48.819 --> 17:50.320
But I don't know how it works.

17:51.572 --> 17:54.241
It reacts when it's close to aliens.

17:55.367 --> 17:59.079
It can wound them, kill them.

18:01.415 --> 18:04.710
But I don't know if it'll work
against these new aliens out there.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.004
And your son? Does he know?

18:07.004 --> 18:10.132
Your daughter here said that he was
the one that found that shard,

18:10.132 --> 18:12.176
that he could speak to it.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.138
If we could talk to him.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.015
Get a hold of him...

18:19.183 --> 18:20.434
Take us back to our cell.

18:21.268 --> 18:22.853
You already have one of my kids.

18:22.853 --> 18:24.938
You will not have the other one.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.774
<i>You said you were able to access
the alien portal before.</i>

18:27.774 --> 18:31.028
<i>Assuming that we can find this portal
that's been taking people in Idabel,</i>

18:31.028 --> 18:33.655
<i>can you access that portal
and keep it open long enough</i>

18:33.655 --> 18:35.866
<i>for us to send through a team of soldiers?</i>

18:36.992 --> 18:37.993
<i>Miss Yamato?</i>

18:39.828 --> 18:41.663
Sorry, Madam President.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.082
My mind--

18:44.082 --> 18:45.542
We'll be ready, Madam President.

18:45.542 --> 18:48.045
<i>Good, because a young man
is braving great risk</i>

18:48.045 --> 18:49.588
<i>to meet our soldiers on that ship.</i>

18:49.588 --> 18:53.133
Assuming that the portal can lead
the soldiers to where you say it does,

18:53.133 --> 18:54.801
<i>it's the best shot we've got.</i>

18:54.801 --> 18:56.595
<i>So, yes, be ready.</i>

19:02.351 --> 19:07.981
I can control it. It can't control me.
I can control it. It can't control me.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.901
Hanley and his damn radio
is driving me insane.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.111
Luke?

19:13.737 --> 19:14.821
Luke, what's wrong?

19:14.821 --> 19:17.115
Aliens. I can feel them.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.576
They're out there.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.537
That's why they're coming.

19:21.537 --> 19:23.330
- All units be on alert.
- Wait.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.541
- It may be looking for a portal.
- Listen.

19:25.541 --> 19:28.961
<i>All units are to be on alert
for a flying alien entity.</i>

19:28.961 --> 19:30.045
<i>Possibly--</i>

19:30.629 --> 19:34.341
<i>Just received intel there may be
a portal somewhere in Idabel.</i>

19:34.341 --> 19:38.512
<i>All units are hereby advised to stay alert
for any signs of an alien portal.</i>

19:38.512 --> 19:40.389
That thing they've been talking about
on the radio.

19:40.389 --> 19:41.682
- Luke.
- The portal.

19:41.682 --> 19:43.475
It's here and there's aliens
coming to protect it.

19:43.475 --> 19:44.935
That more than settles it. Let's go.

19:44.935 --> 19:46.854
What? No. We have to help the soldiers.

19:46.854 --> 19:49.064
- Since when?
- Luke, listen.

19:49.690 --> 19:52.359
We took a vote
and Ryder and I are gonna stay

19:52.359 --> 19:54.945
to make sure your family's safe,
but everybody else is...

19:54.945 --> 19:57.155
We're leaving Idabel. Now.

19:58.574 --> 20:00.784
- You're running away?
- We've lost enough lives.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.578
I thought you were all about saving them.

20:09.126 --> 20:11.211
Attention, members of The Movement!

20:12.713 --> 20:16.675
Drop your weapons and exit slowly
through the doorway.

20:16.675 --> 20:19.511
Noncompliance will be seen
as an act of aggression.

20:19.511 --> 20:21.471
You have 20 seconds.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.265
I'm not going down without a fight.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.725
Everybody stay calm.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.395
Luke! What are you doing?

20:30.063 --> 20:31.231
I know what you're looking for.

20:31.231 --> 20:33.525
Son, I'm going to need you
to get down on the ground now.

20:33.525 --> 20:35.694
The portal to the mother ship.
You need my help.

20:35.694 --> 20:37.237
I don't know how you think you can help,

20:37.237 --> 20:39.698
but right now I need you
to clear the doorway.

20:39.698 --> 20:41.783
Don't shoot! We're complying.

20:42.784 --> 20:44.953
- Aren't we, Luke?
- All of you, get down now!

20:44.953 --> 20:46.413
- Listen to me.
- Luke.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.706
Don't--

20:48.373 --> 20:50.000
- What's he doing?
- What's wrong with him?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.126
Watch it.

20:55.923 --> 20:57.216
On our 6:00.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.524
This--

21:14.066 --> 21:15.275
This is how I can help.

21:15.275 --> 21:17.319
You? You're doing this?

21:17.819 --> 21:18.946
You can stop them?

21:18.946 --> 21:21.782
If there's one, there's more.
They travel in packs.

21:21.782 --> 21:23.659
We heard you're looking
for some kind of portal.

21:23.659 --> 21:25.661
Whatever that portal is,
they're coming to protect it.

21:25.661 --> 21:30.499
So, what do you say we... set aside
the bullshit and we help each other?

21:36.004 --> 21:37.130
Get me General Mitchell.

21:37.130 --> 21:38.882
He's gonna wanna hear this.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.761
Go! Move, move!

21:44.221 --> 21:45.222
Clear the area!

21:45.222 --> 21:47.307
Mom, what's happening?

21:47.307 --> 21:48.767
It's okay, sweetie.

21:48.767 --> 21:51.061
It's okay. It's nothing. It's all right.

21:51.645 --> 21:52.688
Malik.

21:54.189 --> 21:56.191
What's going on? Are we in danger?

21:56.191 --> 21:58.819
The aliens have breached
the gates of Idabel.

21:58.819 --> 22:00.404
Why are you telling me this?

22:00.404 --> 22:03.323
We've been looking for a portal,
an entity, in this town.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.827
Your son says those aliens
are here to protect it.

22:06.827 --> 22:08.412
- Where is my son?
- He's with my men.

22:08.412 --> 22:09.913
Where are they taking him?

22:09.913 --> 22:11.790
Ma'am,
it's a dangerous situation out there.

22:11.790 --> 22:15.752
Listen, if you take us to him, keep us
safe, I'll help with anything you need.

22:17.462 --> 22:18.881
Luke trusts me.

22:25.262 --> 22:28.640
Kid, are you sure the aliens
are here to protect this thing?

22:35.606 --> 22:37.274
I can see what they see.

22:39.109 --> 22:40.277
They're moving fast.

22:42.821 --> 22:45.532
Where? Which way are they going?

22:50.412 --> 22:51.747
They're going to town.

22:55.083 --> 22:58.879
General, the kid says
the hunter-killers are headed for town.

22:58.879 --> 23:01.507
Get ready.
Whatever prep you need to do, do it now.

23:25.697 --> 23:28.575
<i>Every step, I'll be right here.</i>

23:29.451 --> 23:31.119
<i>You are not alone in there.</i>

23:31.119 --> 23:34.581
If you remember anything, remember that.

23:49.972 --> 23:51.473
We'll be monitoring your systems

23:51.473 --> 23:54.142
and maintaining your levels
if you start to drop.

23:59.815 --> 24:02.192
I-- I don't know what will happen
up there,

24:02.985 --> 24:04.403
but I know this, Caspar,

24:04.945 --> 24:06.572
what I've known for a long time,

24:07.447 --> 24:08.949
you're a fighter.

24:10.117 --> 24:11.660
So you find ways to survive.

24:12.536 --> 24:13.662
We'll be here to help.

24:34.349 --> 24:38.020
Okay, yeah,
this is some straight up exorcist shit.

24:38.020 --> 24:40.647
If heads start spinning, bro, I am out.

24:58.165 --> 24:59.458
I don't see anything.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.460
You still sensing them getting closer?

25:05.672 --> 25:07.424
The hell are they doing with a kid?

25:25.859 --> 25:27.945
What? What is it?

25:39.873 --> 25:42.459
General, we've got something.

25:50.217 --> 25:52.386
Get up. Get up. Get up, my friend!

26:02.521 --> 26:03.522
They're here.

26:16.535 --> 26:18.954
Move! Spread out! Go! Go!

26:18.954 --> 26:20.247
- Move out!
- Go! Go!

26:20.247 --> 26:21.874
- Move it!
- Come on!

26:26.962 --> 26:28.213
Go, go, go, go!

26:35.012 --> 26:37.639
Trev, stop! Where are you going?

26:51.320 --> 26:52.696
Go, go, go!

27:29.149 --> 27:30.317
Luke!

27:30.317 --> 27:32.027
- Get back.
- No, let me go!

27:32.027 --> 27:34.905
- Get back. Get back.
- Let me go! Do something!

27:53.298 --> 27:54.258
Can you hold them?

28:00.264 --> 28:01.473
<i>We are with you.</i>

28:25.289 --> 28:26.290
Did you do that?

28:28.625 --> 28:29.626
They did.

28:59.948 --> 29:01.992
<i>They have a visual
on the entity in Idabel.</i>

29:01.992 --> 29:03.619
<i>The team is ready. Is she?</i>

29:04.536 --> 29:05.537
Mitsuki?

29:06.371 --> 29:08.081
<i>Mitsuki? Can you hear me?</i>

29:08.874 --> 29:10.000
<i>They found the portal.</i>

29:12.419 --> 29:15.088
<i>Can you see it? Feel it?</i>

29:20.594 --> 29:21.637
They're everywhere.

29:21.637 --> 29:23.639
- Look for destruction...
- Look for destruction...

29:23.639 --> 29:25.807
- ...soldiers, dead aliens.
- ...soldiers, dead aliens.

29:31.730 --> 29:32.731
I see it.

29:35.359 --> 29:36.985
Her heart rate's more erratic.

29:36.985 --> 29:38.987
EEG's phasing all over the place.

29:38.987 --> 29:40.822
Sphenoidal and suboccipital.

29:40.822 --> 29:42.574
<i>I thought you said she could do this.</i>

29:42.574 --> 29:46.078
If she can't stabilize herself, she
certainly cannot stabilize that portal.

29:46.662 --> 29:47.871
<i>This is our chance.</i>

29:48.372 --> 29:50.457
<i>Dr. Castillo, is she ready?</i>

29:54.127 --> 29:55.212
Mitsuki.

29:56.463 --> 29:57.673
<i>Mitsuki, do you hear me?</i>

29:59.716 --> 30:00.884
I hear you.

30:01.635 --> 30:02.845
I can keep her stable.

30:04.096 --> 30:06.223
Turn my voice to maximum volume
in her ear.

30:07.474 --> 30:11.395
Mitsuki, we can't rely on your long-term
memories to keep you grounded.

30:12.396 --> 30:13.981
I don't know enough about them.

30:14.565 --> 30:16.984
Details, specifics.

30:17.776 --> 30:19.903
But I know all about our memories.

30:21.196 --> 30:22.197
Everything.

30:22.948 --> 30:23.949
<i>Every moment.</i>

30:25.075 --> 30:26.827
<i>Remember our first time in the Amazon?</i>

30:28.287 --> 30:29.997
<i>I told you to touch the earth.</i>

30:30.497 --> 30:32.207
<i>Remember the feel of the soil?</i>

30:32.833 --> 30:35.711
The way you smiled
when the sun came in through the trees.

30:36.253 --> 30:38.422
The feel of that sun on your skin.

30:39.006 --> 30:42.301
<i>And you said, "When I was a child,
the sun was my..."</i>

30:42.301 --> 30:43.552
Favorite star.

30:52.394 --> 30:53.729
Remember the feel of the earth

30:53.729 --> 30:56.732
<i>in your hands and the smell of the rain.</i>

30:58.192 --> 30:59.568
<i>Remember the cool night air</i>

31:00.319 --> 31:02.487
<i>and the sound of the wind
through the trees.</i>

31:08.702 --> 31:10.537
She's at flat baseline.

31:10.537 --> 31:12.289
She's stabilizing. I-- It worked.

31:17.211 --> 31:18.378
Mitsuki,

31:18.962 --> 31:20.464
<i>can you still see that portal?</i>

31:22.007 --> 31:23.008
Yes.

31:23.592 --> 31:24.635
<i>Good.</i>

31:25.302 --> 31:27.304
Now, can you send a signal to open it?

32:06.969 --> 32:07.970
What's it doing?

32:08.595 --> 32:09.596
What's happening?

33:03.525 --> 33:05.611
You okay? You okay, Luke?

33:05.611 --> 33:07.196
How do we stop this?

33:15.579 --> 33:16.413
Jamila.

33:17.748 --> 33:18.749
Don't.

33:20.792 --> 33:22.377
You don't need to say anything.

33:22.961 --> 33:25.714
You'll need all your strength
for whatever's up there.

33:27.508 --> 33:28.509
You're not coming?

33:29.760 --> 33:31.762
I done what I set out to do.

33:33.847 --> 33:36.725
I found you. Got you here.

33:43.732 --> 33:47.236
The Xylon Queen's gotta protect
her planet, right?

33:48.654 --> 33:49.655
Yeah.

34:00.541 --> 34:02.793
I'll be with you. Always.

34:03.418 --> 34:05.838
Just like you were with me
when you were on the other side.

34:12.553 --> 34:13.554
Yeah.

34:21.687 --> 34:23.813
Well, I guess I'll see you in your dreams.

34:24.690 --> 34:25.690
Yeah.

34:26.483 --> 34:27.484
I'll see you.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.380
I wish things were different.

34:51.717 --> 34:53.092
Make them different.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.097
Go raise some bloody hell up there.

34:59.683 --> 35:00.684
Yeah.

35:17.910 --> 35:18.994
Come on, Casp.

35:19.953 --> 35:21.580
Let's take it to these bastards.

35:26.710 --> 35:29.630
He's under. Now it's the WDC's turn.

35:50.526 --> 35:52.986
Communication...

35:52.986 --> 35:55.072
Connection...

35:55.781 --> 35:57.741
Connection...

36:54.965 --> 36:57.426
Mitsuki, stay with me. I'm here.

37:03.849 --> 37:05.767
<i>Mitsuki, can you still hear me?</i>

37:07.227 --> 37:08.437
We're losing her again.

37:46.099 --> 37:47.267
What's happening to them?

38:04.701 --> 38:05.911
Mitsuki?

38:06.495 --> 38:08.121
Talk to me. Mitsuki?

38:08.121 --> 38:10.666
I-- I--

38:11.333 --> 38:12.334
- Mitsuki?
- I--

38:13.669 --> 38:15.921
I can't control it...

38:18.215 --> 38:19.466
with you.

38:22.427 --> 38:24.346
You have to let me go.

38:24.930 --> 38:27.641
No more memories. No baseline.

38:28.392 --> 38:30.435
I was the only thing keeping you grounded.

38:32.521 --> 38:33.522
Yes.

38:38.527 --> 38:39.653
It's the only way.

38:41.238 --> 38:45.325
To think like them. Be like them.

38:47.870 --> 38:48.871
Let me go.

39:24.156 --> 39:25.282
How is this--

39:27.117 --> 39:28.577
W-What's happening?

40:01.693 --> 40:02.694
Are you doing this?

40:05.364 --> 40:06.448
Then what is?

40:11.787 --> 40:14.248
Let go of the past...

40:19.127 --> 40:21.588
Let go of this world...

40:25.342 --> 40:27.928
These feeds have been dormant
since the entity died.

40:28.554 --> 40:30.722
I don't understand
how they're back online.

40:32.057 --> 40:34.059
There's no alien consciousness in there.

40:35.269 --> 40:36.478
Yes, there is.

40:41.316 --> 40:44.111
Let it all go...

40:47.990 --> 40:50.784
and go in.

40:56.206 --> 40:57.583
It's under control.

40:59.626 --> 41:00.878
Someone can go in.

41:05.591 --> 41:07.092
We don't know what's in there,

41:07.926 --> 41:08.927
what's up there.

41:19.897 --> 41:21.273
They know what's down here.

41:28.071 --> 41:29.072
Trev.

41:33.118 --> 41:34.786
What's down here is worth saving.

42:05.192 --> 42:06.944
She's on the same frequency.

42:08.111 --> 42:09.279
These readings.

42:10.364 --> 42:11.990
She's accessing its mind.

42:14.034 --> 42:15.327
And losing her own.

42:20.123 --> 42:22.042
We're going to attempt another entry.

42:22.042 --> 42:23.961
Can she keep it steady for this?

42:23.961 --> 42:25.045
<i>Is she stable?</i>

42:25.963 --> 42:29.132
I don't know what she is, Madam President,

42:30.509 --> 42:32.261
but she's the only chance you have.

42:33.512 --> 42:34.638
So take it now.

42:44.481 --> 42:45.482
Chief Cole.

42:45.482 --> 42:48.193
You're gonna have to kill me
if you want me to stand down, sir.

42:50.112 --> 42:51.572
You might need this in there.

43:03.333 --> 43:04.334
Are you all right?

43:04.960 --> 43:05.961
I am now.

43:19.349 --> 43:23.562
God, I don't know where you have been
for these last few months.

43:24.062 --> 43:27.399
I have known suffering most of my life.

43:28.150 --> 43:31.111
And I have never asked for your help.

43:35.490 --> 43:38.035
But I am asking now...

43:39.036 --> 43:42.122
help us.

43:46.210 --> 43:49.922
We have not always deserved your grace.

43:54.718 --> 43:59.056
We have not always deserved your world.

44:01.725 --> 44:05.187
But we are fighting for it now...

44:14.446 --> 44:17.115
all of us, together...

44:20.035 --> 44:24.331
And we cannot win this fight without you.

44:24.831 --> 44:29.545
Please, deliver us this miracle.

44:46.687 --> 44:50.482
Please...

47:22.593 --> 47:23.677
Hello?

47:29.308 --> 47:30.434
Trevante.

47:32.936 --> 47:33.937
Caspar.

47:34.438 --> 47:35.564
You're here.

47:36.982 --> 47:37.983
You made it.

47:38.775 --> 47:39.776
Yeah, I did.

47:41.653 --> 47:43.322
Guess we're partners again, huh?

47:44.740 --> 47:46.241
A little different this time.

47:47.618 --> 47:48.702
Yeah.

47:50.037 --> 47:51.038
Yeah.

47:52.706 --> 47:53.582
You ready?

47:54.958 --> 47:55.959
Let's find out.

48:03.717 --> 48:04.718
Follow me.
