[walking on metal]

00:47.875 --> 00:52.708
[clanking]

00:57.083 --> 01:02.916
[walking faster]

01:28.458 --> 01:32.791
[tape rewinding]

01:49.916 --> 01:53.166
[man] For the record,
state your name and age.

01:53.958 --> 01:55.250
Gert de Jager.

01:56.541 --> 01:57.666
Forty-three years.

02:22.333 --> 02:23.666
[Gert] I want to put on the record

02:23.750 --> 02:26.375
that I'm not doing this
for any time off or anything like that.

02:28.958 --> 02:31.291
I just want to help the girls' parents.

02:31.375 --> 02:32.375
You know.

02:33.541 --> 02:35.958
Find out what happened to them.

02:36.041 --> 02:39.000
[man] Okay. So tell us what happened.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.500
[car rattling]

02:48.791 --> 02:50.000
[Gert] They're gone.

02:52.458 --> 02:54.833
Not just the five or six that you know of.

02:56.125 --> 02:57.708
There's more than 40.

02:58.875 --> 03:03.833
-[car rattling]
-[sobbing]

03:04.458 --> 03:05.833
[Gert] My girlfriend and I…

03:07.458 --> 03:09.333
we kidnapped them, but…

03:11.041 --> 03:12.375
it wasn't for us.

03:15.375 --> 03:17.583
We were acting under instructions.

03:17.666 --> 03:18.916
[man] From whom?

03:25.708 --> 03:27.958
From a National Party cabinet minister.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.416
[man] Which minister?

03:40.583 --> 03:41.625
I can't say.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.958
He'll have me murdered.

03:47.208 --> 03:48.791
[Gert] Even here.

03:48.875 --> 03:50.333
[man] Okay, and the girls?

03:50.416 --> 03:51.958
[girls sobbing]

03:53.833 --> 03:57.333
He had a farm in Brakpan.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.333
[Gert] It's like a lodge.

04:17.625 --> 04:22.041
[sobbing]

04:23.166 --> 04:25.000
[woman] Come on! Get out! Out! Out!

04:25.083 --> 04:27.166
[girl crying]

04:28.625 --> 04:30.666
[woman] Come on, quick-quick!

04:36.625 --> 04:37.833
[blows harshly]

04:41.333 --> 04:43.333
-[woman sighs deeply]
-[girl sobbing]

05:01.708 --> 05:03.625
-[fingers snapping]
-[woman] Let's go.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.708
[woman] Hey!

05:12.416 --> 05:13.708
My goodness…

05:23.291 --> 05:24.791
[Gert] They had this airstrip.

05:26.000 --> 05:31.583
From here, the girls were smuggled
to the Middle East, maybe Iran.

05:32.958 --> 05:36.666
There were sanctions back then
so they were traded for oil.

05:38.541 --> 05:40.291
Kind of like a barter deal.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.375
[girls sobbing]

05:44.541 --> 05:47.666
-[man in Afrikaans] Take them away.
-[man] Go, go, go. Go here.

06:05.541 --> 06:07.958
The thing is,
not all of them were smuggled.

06:09.583 --> 06:10.458
[man] Why's that?

06:13.166 --> 06:15.750
Some were used and…

06:19.083 --> 06:20.166
then killed.

06:32.083 --> 06:33.541
[tape stops]

06:36.333 --> 06:39.000
[footsteps moving slowly]

06:57.125 --> 06:59.208
[girl sobbing]

07:04.916 --> 07:10.625

09:09.500 --> 09:11.583

09:37.541 --> 09:39.375
[trunk opening]

09:42.166 --> 09:46.541
[agitated breathing]

09:48.458 --> 09:49.541
[gunshot]

10:13.791 --> 10:18.083
[children talking]

10:18.166 --> 10:20.625
[car approaching]

10:56.541 --> 11:00.208
[soldiers yelling]

11:09.375 --> 11:12.208
-[soldier] All right, all right!
-Police! Police! Police!

11:13.083 --> 11:17.000
[distorted voice on the radio]

11:19.416 --> 11:20.416
[cocks gun]

11:20.500 --> 11:22.666
Jode… Jodie!

11:23.791 --> 11:25.541
[soldier talking]

11:28.666 --> 11:31.458
-[gunshots]
-[canister explodes]

11:46.750 --> 11:48.041
[soldier] All clear! All clear!

11:51.875 --> 11:53.125
Ugh!

11:53.208 --> 11:54.583
Freeze! Halt!

11:56.708 --> 11:58.666
Pursuing a suspect on foot, rear window.

12:05.458 --> 12:06.375
[grunts]

12:11.791 --> 12:14.708
[screaming, shouts]

12:29.166 --> 12:33.916
[man talking over the radio]

12:34.000 --> 12:34.875
Fuck.

12:34.958 --> 12:36.791
[man on radio] Check in.

12:47.416 --> 12:48.666
[Jodie] Where are they?

12:52.500 --> 12:54.500
[panting]

14:12.208 --> 14:16.291
[sobbing]

14:21.250 --> 14:22.333
Oh, fuck…

14:55.333 --> 14:57.958
[man over the phone] Get your act
straight! Get your shit together!

14:58.041 --> 15:00.166
I don't want to have
this conversation with you again.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.208
[line disconnects]

15:05.208 --> 15:07.458
[phone ringing]

15:07.541 --> 15:10.125
OLD WOUNDS ARE REOPENED

15:13.291 --> 15:14.458
[knocking]

15:20.375 --> 15:22.000
"Tactical and financial constraints"?

15:22.083 --> 15:24.250
-They had counter-surveillance.
-Should've waited.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.750
If we don't get to them in 48 hours…

15:25.833 --> 15:27.500
-I know.
-Life expectancy…

15:27.583 --> 15:30.250
The resources are
the damned resources, Jodie.

15:32.125 --> 15:33.000
Okay.

15:36.416 --> 15:39.083
So you tell me how do we get to here?

15:39.166 --> 15:41.583
I mean, never mind how they traffic
underage girls overseas

15:41.666 --> 15:43.125
when we don't have what we need

15:43.208 --> 15:45.458
to catch the guys
snatching girls right off the street.

15:46.125 --> 15:47.666
Jodie…

15:47.750 --> 15:51.000
If you don't make busts,
I can't get funding.

15:52.041 --> 15:55.500
No funding, and this whole
operation gets shut down.

15:58.583 --> 15:59.458
Anything?

16:01.083 --> 16:03.541
[woman] Some prints, but no.

16:13.791 --> 16:14.958
[knocking]

16:17.083 --> 16:19.250
I've asked Samuel
to come speak to us today.

16:19.333 --> 16:21.375
He has a case we may be interested in.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.500
Arendse, Murder & Robbery.

16:25.666 --> 16:30.000
White male, 60s,
looks like some kind of ritual killing.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.291
Oupa here is a suspected pedophile.

16:32.375 --> 16:34.500
He used to be on a trafficking watch list.

16:34.583 --> 16:35.791
[Jodie] When?

16:35.875 --> 16:37.708
[man] Twenty, thirty years ago.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.125
Captain, with all due respect…

16:42.833 --> 16:44.750
Jodie, I want you to take this case.

16:44.833 --> 16:46.416
-Sorry?
-Look, just do it.

16:47.541 --> 16:49.708
Thamsanqa, you take over here.

16:55.625 --> 16:56.500
Captain?

17:00.875 --> 17:04.291
I'm sorry, but am I off the operation?

17:04.375 --> 17:06.458
-The Brigadier called me.
-That asshole.

17:06.541 --> 17:08.375
We're not meeting the minimum requirements

17:08.458 --> 17:10.041
-for the victims'--
-Give me what I need.

17:10.125 --> 17:12.208
Listen to me! You're fucking up.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.875
-This is the third bust.
-Give me one more surveillance team.

17:14.958 --> 17:17.083
Take the case and take a break!

17:17.166 --> 17:18.458
That's an order.

17:22.541 --> 17:27.416
[guitar music playing]

17:38.916 --> 17:42.500
[sobbing]

17:52.458 --> 17:54.500
[man] Cause of death
is a gunshot wound to the chest,

17:54.583 --> 17:57.125
resulting in a cardiac arrest
caused by hemorrhage.

17:57.208 --> 18:00.375
Superficial burn on the neck.
Could be a Taser.

18:00.458 --> 18:01.291
And then this.

18:10.166 --> 18:11.583
Had me stumped as well.

18:15.125 --> 18:16.750
Where was the body found?

18:16.833 --> 18:18.750
James and Ethel Gray Park.

18:18.833 --> 18:20.916
But he wasn't killed there, he was moved.

18:23.458 --> 18:24.375
Thanks.

18:54.541 --> 18:55.583
[woman] Another drink?

18:56.958 --> 18:58.583
Sure, why not?

18:58.666 --> 18:59.750
[in Zulu] Brother…

19:11.958 --> 19:13.208
Fun guy.

19:16.708 --> 19:20.958
[trumpet playing]

19:21.041 --> 19:24.333
[vocalizing]

19:33.916 --> 19:34.875
You're great.

19:37.583 --> 19:38.500
[chuckling]

19:41.750 --> 19:42.833
I love this song.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.041
What?

19:46.125 --> 19:47.208
-Mh-hm.
-No.

19:47.291 --> 19:49.291
Don't worry, there are
some white people there.

19:49.375 --> 19:51.458
[laughing] What?

19:51.541 --> 19:52.625
Oh.

19:54.625 --> 19:57.875
[song continues]

20:12.583 --> 20:16.000
[song fading out]

20:48.583 --> 20:51.166
[Samuel] Can you think of anyone
who wanted to hurt your father?

20:53.583 --> 20:55.041
He had his flaws, but…

20:56.083 --> 20:57.541
But he was a good man.

20:58.541 --> 21:00.208
Mrs. Lourens, did you know his name

21:00.291 --> 21:03.083
was on the old National Register
for Sex Offenders?

21:05.333 --> 21:07.208
He was found not guilty.

21:08.916 --> 21:10.416
Who made the allegations?

21:15.791 --> 21:19.000
Mrs. Lourens,
it's easier here than in court.

21:21.666 --> 21:24.250
[Mrs. Lourens] At that time,
he was high up in the National Party.

21:26.083 --> 21:28.958
They had many enemies, as you know.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.041
[Jodie] Excuse me.

21:59.458 --> 22:00.375
Hey.

22:02.708 --> 22:04.541
[in Afrikaans] Are you a police lady?

22:04.625 --> 22:05.500
Mm-hm.

22:06.833 --> 22:08.041
[in Afrikaans] I'm Jodie.

22:09.125 --> 22:10.500
[in Afrikaans] What's your name?

22:10.583 --> 22:11.458
Liezel.

22:11.541 --> 22:13.166
[in Afrikaans] That's a pretty name.

22:17.708 --> 22:20.791
-[in Afrikaans] It's not necessary…
-[in English] Just give me one second.

22:24.125 --> 22:26.000
[in Afrikaans]
I'm sorry about your grandfather.

22:43.875 --> 22:45.416
[Jodie in English] Open the garage.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.458
-[Mrs. Lourens] Why do you want to…
-[in Afrikaans] Open the garage!

22:48.541 --> 22:50.708
[Samuel in Afrikaans] We have a warrant.

22:50.791 --> 22:52.791
[mechanical whirring]

23:15.666 --> 23:20.333
[dramatic percussion builds]

23:33.416 --> 23:35.083
Arendse, get me that ladder.

23:52.416 --> 23:53.500
Holy shit.

23:56.458 --> 24:01.750
[thunder roaring in the distance]

25:03.666 --> 25:08.500
[girl in the video crying]

25:22.458 --> 25:23.541
[sighs]

25:27.125 --> 25:28.500
What do you think?

25:31.583 --> 25:34.541
I think whoever murdered Carel
knew he was into this.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.708
"T.S.C." It's…

25:46.208 --> 25:47.875
Some kind of message.

25:49.416 --> 25:50.291
Are you okay?

25:53.541 --> 25:54.416
I'm fine.

25:57.083 --> 25:58.083
It's just…

26:00.166 --> 26:03.000
This is kind of monstrous
in its own right, you know?

26:04.625 --> 26:08.458
Why don't you check out other crimes
in the same area? Same date.

26:09.916 --> 26:10.791
Thanks.

26:57.625 --> 26:59.416
[quick walking]

27:04.541 --> 27:07.166
[man in Afrikaans] Get inside the house,
quickly! Come on, move it!

27:12.708 --> 27:15.041
[man in Afrikaans]
Quickly. Move, move! Come on!

27:15.125 --> 27:17.583
[man in Afrikaans]
Come on, come on. Hurry up!

27:20.291 --> 27:21.541
[in Afrikaans] Come on, come on.

27:21.625 --> 27:23.375
[woman in Afrikaans] My goodness, get in!

27:23.458 --> 27:24.958
[man in Afrikaans] Thanks, Gert.

27:25.041 --> 27:26.500
[in Afrikaans] Get in.

27:27.208 --> 27:29.000
[man in Afrikaans]
That one has been used up.

27:53.541 --> 27:59.375
[girl singing slowly]

28:49.000 --> 28:49.916
[woman] Come!

28:50.000 --> 28:55.583
[electronic music playing in the distance]

29:00.958 --> 29:02.958
[overlapping chatter]

29:49.458 --> 29:52.625
[dramatic percussion builds]

31:09.375 --> 31:11.208
[door opening]

31:16.458 --> 31:17.375
[man] Thank you.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.041
[exhales]

31:45.666 --> 31:47.041
[ringing bell]

31:59.250 --> 32:02.083
-Jodie, what are you doing here?
-I have something you need to see.

32:02.166 --> 32:04.458
Personal residences
are strictly off-limits.

32:04.541 --> 32:06.041
Just listen to me for a second.

32:06.125 --> 32:07.916
Get in your car
and go home, get some sleep.

32:08.000 --> 32:09.833
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't important.

32:13.166 --> 32:14.083
Come on.

32:36.875 --> 32:37.875
[Jodie] T.S.C.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.541
I believe it stands
for Tarrynlee Shaw Carter.

32:47.041 --> 32:50.208
[in Setswana] Hey, guys, go to bed,
you know the rules.

32:51.333 --> 32:52.333
Agnes…

32:59.083 --> 33:01.625
His body was found
in James and Ethel Gray Park.

33:01.708 --> 33:05.458
Same place and date that Tarrynlee
was abducted by Gert de Jager.

33:05.541 --> 33:06.750
Gert de Jager…

33:06.833 --> 33:09.083
-De Jager abducted six girls.
-Yeah, I know the history.

33:09.166 --> 33:11.041
This man is a pedophile.

33:13.125 --> 33:14.916
Even his own granddaughter.

33:15.833 --> 33:17.125
Which he recorded.

33:19.250 --> 33:20.958
Wait until your kids are in bed.

33:23.541 --> 33:25.583
Jodie, how much sleep have you had?

33:25.666 --> 33:28.791
George, I want to bring in the operation,
this could be a new line of inquiry.

33:28.875 --> 33:31.500
We barely have the resources
for our current investigations.

33:31.583 --> 33:32.958
Gert de Jager…

33:33.041 --> 33:35.916
Gert de Jager took six girls
who were never found.

33:36.541 --> 33:39.208
Tarrynlee, Frances Hughes,
Jenna Hartley, Olivia Booysen,

33:39.291 --> 33:41.666
-Abigail Viljoen and Yvette Rossouw.
-Twenty years ago.

33:41.750 --> 33:44.791
If the killer is using them
as a scorecard,

33:44.875 --> 33:47.000
there's going to be five more bodies.

33:47.083 --> 33:49.541
-Murder & Robbery's problem.
-I know. But get this:

33:49.625 --> 33:53.625
Shortly after he was arrested,
Gert de Jager confessed on tape.

33:53.708 --> 33:55.666
He fingered a National Party minister,

33:55.750 --> 33:58.666
and the next day he was found
murdered in his cell.

33:59.875 --> 34:00.958
Do you have the tape?

34:03.458 --> 34:06.083
No, it was classified under apartheid,
but I'm going to find it.

34:06.166 --> 34:08.958
Jodie, you're making connections
you simply can't prove.

34:09.041 --> 34:11.375
I need the operation, damn it, George, I--

34:12.166 --> 34:13.083
[sighs]

34:15.583 --> 34:19.541
Jodie, I'm going to suggest
that you go to Health & Wellness

34:19.625 --> 34:21.208
for psychological evaluation.

34:21.291 --> 34:22.875
-It is my assessment…
-Here we go.

34:22.958 --> 34:25.166
-…you're suffering post-traumatic stress.
-Bullshit.

34:25.250 --> 34:27.041
This job gets to all of us.

34:27.125 --> 34:30.583
[softly] It's supposed to get to us,
otherwise what the fuck are we doing?

34:38.166 --> 34:40.500
I'm going to insist
that you take three months off.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.875
[quick punching]

35:00.708 --> 35:03.916
[grunting]

35:09.958 --> 35:11.125
Easy.

35:31.250 --> 35:33.250
-[breathing heavily]
-[ringing tone]

35:35.666 --> 35:37.125
You okay?

35:42.916 --> 35:45.541
[grunting]

35:45.625 --> 35:47.166
Ah!

35:48.541 --> 35:50.541
[panting]

35:57.333 --> 35:58.333
We're done.

36:00.416 --> 36:01.500
[Jodie] Come on!

36:03.833 --> 36:05.541
[woman] Give me your hands.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.458
Give me your hands, Jodie,
and close your eyes.

36:20.125 --> 36:21.666
Take a deep breath in…

36:22.750 --> 36:24.583
and hold for five…

36:25.833 --> 36:26.708
four…

36:28.125 --> 36:29.000
three…

36:31.375 --> 36:32.291
two…

36:33.041 --> 36:34.416
one.

36:34.500 --> 36:35.458
Exhale.

36:35.541 --> 36:38.541
[exhaling]

36:52.000 --> 36:54.250
You know I'm not supposed
to know where you live, right?

36:55.625 --> 36:57.083
Why, are you coming after me?

36:58.000 --> 36:58.916
[chuckles]

37:01.041 --> 37:01.916
You never know.

37:12.333 --> 37:13.500
[woman] Where's this?

37:14.625 --> 37:15.583
[Jodie] Oh, that's…

37:16.458 --> 37:18.625
outreach programs for trafficking victims.

37:23.125 --> 37:25.875
[woman] I love that
you don't distance yourself.

37:25.958 --> 37:27.250
Yeah, well…

37:29.708 --> 37:31.375
They feel like my children.

37:47.041 --> 37:48.083
[Jodie] How are you?

37:49.208 --> 37:50.958
You're asking me how I am.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.708
I never know what you're thinking.

38:00.875 --> 38:02.208
Captain told me.

38:10.375 --> 38:11.541
Three months.

38:16.583 --> 38:17.708
I'm sorry.

38:40.791 --> 38:41.958
I could stay.

38:45.583 --> 38:46.958
I need to be alone.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.416

[indistinct radio chatter]

42:14.458 --> 42:17.041
Jodie! What are you doing here?

42:17.125 --> 42:21.166
I told her to come.
She needed to see this.

42:24.041 --> 42:25.208
F.H.

42:29.791 --> 42:31.125
Frances Hughes.

42:36.458 --> 42:37.625
Okay.

42:38.541 --> 42:39.416
Follow me.

43:21.250 --> 43:27.541
[girl singing slowly]

43:37.500 --> 43:39.000
Jodie.

44:07.291 --> 44:09.041
[George] What are you thinking?

44:13.750 --> 44:15.916
This is where the killer wants us to be.

44:21.708 --> 44:23.916
What about her?

44:24.000 --> 44:26.666
She works here, but she's not talking.

44:26.750 --> 44:29.500
[woman] Captain, have a look at this.

44:30.625 --> 44:32.291
Waybills.

44:32.375 --> 44:35.958
All from the same shipping
container yard in Durban. And get this:

44:36.041 --> 44:38.000
owned by the Khan brothers.

44:39.083 --> 44:41.041
Salim and Parwaz?

44:41.125 --> 44:42.458
Top of the board.

44:46.458 --> 44:49.250
This one is dated for tomorrow,
it's for a shipment.

44:49.333 --> 44:50.708
Outbound.

44:52.708 --> 44:54.541
I could leave first thing in the morning.

44:54.625 --> 44:57.458
-Without a warrant? Jodie…
-I'll do recon only.

44:59.708 --> 45:01.791
I could tag along.

45:01.875 --> 45:03.833
This is also my investigation.

45:05.083 --> 45:08.000
Okay. But keep it clean.

45:36.291 --> 45:39.291
I'm following a lead to Durban.
I'll see you in a few days.

46:03.333 --> 46:08.083
[man grunting]

46:58.583 --> 47:00.750

48:01.541 --> 48:02.750

48:12.375 --> 48:13.916
[woman] Ntombi!

49:03.916 --> 49:07.500
[girls giggling]

49:37.208 --> 49:38.750
They're checking the waybills.

49:45.958 --> 49:47.833
So what's your deal, Arendse?

49:50.166 --> 49:51.333
My deal?

49:52.833 --> 49:54.208
Yeah, your deal.

49:55.458 --> 49:56.833
Are you profiling me?

50:00.458 --> 50:03.416
I heard you worked undercover,
street gangs in Cape Town…

50:05.166 --> 50:07.791
Apparently they're
into trafficking these days.

50:11.291 --> 50:12.958
So what's your deal, lady?

50:15.000 --> 50:17.500
My deal is right here, right fucking now.

50:17.583 --> 50:20.000
[ship horn blares]

51:13.166 --> 51:15.583
[Jodie] Investigating Officer
Jodie Snyman.

51:16.708 --> 51:19.166
DPCI. Human Trafficking.

51:22.416 --> 51:25.125
I want to know where your containers are.

51:42.041 --> 51:43.625
[man] Where did you get these?

51:49.125 --> 51:51.166
[Jodie] If you cooperate now…

51:52.833 --> 51:54.166
it'll look good for you.

51:55.500 --> 51:56.583
Jodie.

52:05.041 --> 52:06.500
Tell me where this is.

52:06.583 --> 52:08.833
I'd like to see a warrant.

53:04.625 --> 53:06.833
-[Samuel] Jodie…
-We can't just stand around.

53:09.958 --> 53:11.791
Jodie, don't do it.

53:11.875 --> 53:13.333
You don't have to come.

53:14.791 --> 53:15.875
Fuck.

53:37.166 --> 53:40.250
-Are these outbound?
-Excuse me, what are you doing?

53:40.333 --> 53:41.666
I'm opening them up.

53:41.750 --> 53:42.708
[man] Who are you guys?

53:42.791 --> 53:44.666
Investigating Officers, Human Trafficking.

53:44.750 --> 53:45.708
You cannot come in here.

53:45.791 --> 53:47.583
I want to take a look
in these containers, now.

53:47.666 --> 53:50.916
-Are you mad?
-Listen to me. You open them, or I will.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.666
Listen carefully, sir.
One way or the other,

53:53.750 --> 53:55.916
we're looking into these containers.

53:57.958 --> 53:59.750
This is bullshit.

53:59.833 --> 54:00.666
[whistles]

54:00.750 --> 54:02.375
[man] Open this container.

54:24.416 --> 54:27.250
-Why are they empty?
-[man] Redistribution.

54:31.458 --> 54:32.666
Open this one.

54:34.875 --> 54:36.416
Do it!

54:36.500 --> 54:37.750
Open it.

54:46.625 --> 54:48.083
What…

54:56.166 --> 54:58.583
Officer, I assure you I have
the documents for all that.

55:02.375 --> 55:03.625
What is this?

55:08.416 --> 55:09.541
Fuck.

55:28.375 --> 55:30.333
[police siren]

55:30.416 --> 55:31.291
Shit.

55:36.416 --> 55:38.625
[Samuel] It's okay, we're leaving.

55:38.708 --> 55:39.625
Jodie.

55:39.708 --> 55:40.958
Jodie!

55:50.083 --> 55:51.375
[Jodie] We raided the yard.

55:51.458 --> 55:54.125
There was nothing
in the fucking containers. I fucked up.

55:54.208 --> 55:55.500
Jesus, Jodie.

55:58.875 --> 56:02.458
Look, it's fine.
No one's going to say anything.

56:02.541 --> 56:05.291
[Ntombi] Jodie, this could lead to Parwaz.

56:05.375 --> 56:09.708
You realize, even if we did get a warrant,
whatever we found would be inadmissible?

56:09.791 --> 56:13.833
And what if we'd found children?
Young girls? I mean…

56:13.916 --> 56:18.291
There's no way I couldn't have gone
in there. You would have done the same.

56:18.375 --> 56:22.041
Jodie, you're compromising this
investigation, pull your shit together.

56:30.583 --> 56:31.708
[gun cocks]

56:31.791 --> 56:33.958
[gunshots]

56:53.125 --> 56:54.583
[Jodie sighs]

57:01.041 --> 57:03.250
Thanks for sticking up for me today.

57:11.458 --> 57:14.666
How many trafficking convictions
did you get last year?

57:21.541 --> 57:22.875
You don't want to know.

57:48.125 --> 57:49.750
[thunder roaring]

57:49.833 --> 57:51.541
[dramatic percussion builds]

58:03.958 --> 58:05.500
I'm heading up.

58:05.583 --> 58:09.166
Yeah, me too.
Can I get a bottle of pinotage?

58:14.375 --> 58:15.875
Drowning my sorrows.

59:19.250 --> 59:22.166

-[quick knocking]

59:35.041 --> 59:37.250
[Samuel] Jodie! We've got to go!

59:37.333 --> 59:38.666
Now, Jodie!

59:44.541 --> 59:46.875
[sirens wailing in distance]

59:46.958 --> 59:48.958
[helicopter whirring overhead]

1:00:17.875 --> 1:00:18.833
Hawks.

1:00:26.666 --> 1:00:27.875
Jenna Hartley.

1:00:30.750 --> 1:00:33.625
Excuse me, ma'am?
I think you'll want to see this.

1:02:01.375 --> 1:02:04.416
I want every one of these,
from every container.

1:02:04.500 --> 1:02:05.708
[man] We're on it.

1:02:09.625 --> 1:02:11.583
[thunder rumbling]

1:02:12.083 --> 1:02:14.583
Selma, sort this out for me, please.

1:02:22.500 --> 1:02:23.666
[George] Jode.

1:02:28.958 --> 1:02:32.791
These manifests connect a lot
of different parties to the containers.

1:02:32.875 --> 1:02:35.875
We have names, connections, locations.

1:02:35.958 --> 1:02:37.291
[George] This is…

1:02:38.458 --> 1:02:39.625
This is unbelievable.

1:02:40.875 --> 1:02:43.791
I've got a national intervention
task force on standby.

1:02:43.875 --> 1:02:45.750
I'm talking multiple arrests,

1:02:45.833 --> 1:02:47.458
convictions.

1:02:47.541 --> 1:02:51.625
-And the Khan brothers?
-Salim and Parwaz have gone underground.

1:02:51.708 --> 1:02:55.625
But we've put a lookout.
We're going to get those bastards.

1:02:59.416 --> 1:03:00.791
You mind?

1:03:01.916 --> 1:03:03.166
[George] Of course.

1:03:08.083 --> 1:03:11.208
I have some
uncomfortable questions to ask.

1:03:13.125 --> 1:03:15.708
Only some members of your unit
knew what was going on at this yard.

1:03:15.791 --> 1:03:16.666
Is that correct?

1:03:18.208 --> 1:03:20.041
What are you trying to say?

1:03:22.958 --> 1:03:25.250
It's more than likely
that someone in your operation

1:03:25.333 --> 1:03:27.583
was involved in some way or the other.

1:03:29.250 --> 1:03:32.666
Seems like this particular person
is just two steps ahead all the time.

1:03:35.125 --> 1:03:36.333
Any thoughts?

1:03:42.333 --> 1:03:43.250
[people chattering]

1:03:43.333 --> 1:03:45.250
[anchor] The community
of the church of Sunderland

1:03:45.333 --> 1:03:48.083
was shattered today
when pastor Marius Groenewald

1:03:48.166 --> 1:03:49.958
was arrested on charges of child abuse

1:03:50.041 --> 1:03:53.083
and selling at-risk children
to traffickers.

1:03:53.166 --> 1:03:55.708
This comes
after a startling discovery in Durban,

1:03:55.791 --> 1:03:57.875
of children from a nearby township

1:03:57.958 --> 1:04:00.791
found in a container marked
for shipping to the Middle East.

1:04:01.791 --> 1:04:03.375
[Samuel] Jodie, I like you.

1:04:04.041 --> 1:04:06.541
But you have to admit,
the most likely scenario is

1:04:06.625 --> 1:04:08.833
that somebody is working from the inside.

1:04:10.166 --> 1:04:11.916
[anchor 2] Police have
arrested Tina Moloi,

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:14.625
the principal of the Reformed
Primary School of Kgomotso,

1:04:14.708 --> 1:04:17.333
believed to be involved
in the disappearance of several children

1:04:17.416 --> 1:04:21.166
who were rescued last week
from a container yard in Durban.

1:04:22.375 --> 1:04:25.791
Captain Ntombizonke Bapai.

1:04:26.916 --> 1:04:29.166
Can you tell me how long
you have been with the operation?

1:04:29.250 --> 1:04:30.416
[Ntombi] Eight months.

1:04:32.791 --> 1:04:35.416
[Jodie] Mr. Marais, you're under arrest
for the illegal production

1:04:35.500 --> 1:04:38.625
and distribution of pornographic
material involving minors.

1:04:38.708 --> 1:04:41.708
Any utterances you make to officers
may be used against you in court.

1:04:41.791 --> 1:04:44.083
You have the right to consult an attorney.

1:04:44.166 --> 1:04:46.375
[Samuel]
I don't suspect Jodie, not at all.

1:04:46.458 --> 1:04:49.666
That woman has got
too much integrity, she's too invested.

1:04:51.625 --> 1:04:54.958
I'm only giving you the heads-up
because I have to submit my report.

1:04:55.041 --> 1:04:58.500
But the chances of you getting a call
from the Brigadier is more than likely.

1:04:58.583 --> 1:04:59.916
[George] I appreciate it.

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:04.375
[Jodie] This is our target.
Salim Khan, 60s, Indian.

1:05:09.416 --> 1:05:13.083
[soldiers] Go, go, go!

1:05:14.291 --> 1:05:17.958
[anchor 2] Salim Khan was arrested today.
It is alleged he is a senior operator

1:05:18.041 --> 1:05:20.875
in an international child
and sex trafficking syndicate,

1:05:20.958 --> 1:05:23.625
with his brother, Parwaz Khan,
who is still at large.

1:05:23.708 --> 1:05:26.333
Who masterminds
the syndicate is still unknown,

1:05:26.416 --> 1:05:29.625
but an investigation by Hawks
is making progress.

1:05:41.708 --> 1:05:43.208
Hello.

1:07:40.500 --> 1:07:44.291
[phone ringing]

1:07:44.375 --> 1:07:45.291
George?

1:07:45.375 --> 1:07:48.041
We have a situation.
My house, ten minutes.

1:07:49.125 --> 1:07:50.708
No, just get there.

1:08:05.708 --> 1:08:06.666
Shit.

1:08:22.666 --> 1:08:23.625
