WEBVTT

01:06.392 --> 01:10.638
<i>For those who haven't read the plaque,
we'll read the plaque.</i>

01:11.638 --> 01:14.065
<i>Here men from the planet Earth,</i>

01:14.089 --> 01:15.826
<i>first set foot upon the moon,</i>

01:16.350 --> 01:18.494
<i>July 1969.</i>

01:19.860 --> 01:22.397
<i>We came in peace for all mankind.</i>

03:02.755 --> 03:05.886
If this isn't an insanely beautiful woman,
I'm hanging up.

03:05.910 --> 03:06.748
<i>Sir.</i>

03:06.949 --> 03:08.597
I... I... I think you should listen to this.

03:17.183 --> 03:19.645
Sir?
<i>God damn it! Damn!</i>

03:19.669 --> 03:20.669
Sir?
<i>Damn.</i>

03:21.374 --> 03:24.406
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Come on, baby. Come on.

03:24.430 --> 03:26.796
This better not be another
damn Russian spy job!

03:26.797 --> 03:29.257
Boys from Air Traffic Res say
the skies are clear.

03:29.553 --> 03:30.671
It's the real thing.

03:31.096 --> 03:32.867
A radio signal from another world.

03:33.325 --> 03:35.375
Let. Let's. Let's not jump the gun here.

03:35.457 --> 03:37.996
Get online with Space Command.
They're gonna want to know about...

03:38.705 --> 03:41.368
Jeez, what's with the golf balls.
You're gonna kill me here.

03:41.392 --> 03:42.973
Wait. wait. This can't be right.

03:43.450 --> 03:45.750
The calculated distance from source,

03:45.900 --> 03:49.100
is only 375,000km.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.000
It's coming from the moon.

04:07.150 --> 04:08.500
Who else knows about this?

04:08.600 --> 04:10.950
S.E.T.I. in New Mexico identified a signal.

04:11.468 --> 04:12.468
But...

04:12.798 --> 04:14.989
they're even more confused
than we are, sir.

04:15.900 --> 04:16.899
Excuse me.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.600
Major!
Yes, sir.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.150
Radar reception has been impaired,

04:25.150 --> 04:26.900
but we were able to get these.

04:28.150 --> 04:32.199
We estimate that it has a diameter
of over 550km

04:32.200 --> 04:35.600
and a mass roughly 1/4
the size of our moon.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.300
What the hell is it?

04:38.100 --> 04:39.400
A meteor?
No, sir.

04:39.636 --> 04:40.837
No, definitely not.

04:41.438 --> 04:42.590
How do you know?

04:42.600 --> 04:44.250
Well sir, it's slowing down.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.500
It's what?
It's...

04:46.950 --> 04:48.800
It's slowing down, sir.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
Get me the Secretary of Defense.

04:59.950 --> 05:01.350
Then wake him!

05:05.510 --> 05:06.511
Hello.

05:06.588 --> 05:07.913
<i>Hi.</i>
It's me.

05:08.324 --> 05:09.126
<i>Hi.</i>

05:10.250 --> 05:11.632
<i>What time is it there?</i>

05:12.133 --> 05:13.875
It's 2:45 in the morning.

05:14.045 --> 05:15.396
<i>I know I didn't wake you.</i>

05:15.400 --> 05:17.056
As a matter of fact, you did.

05:17.300 --> 05:18.600
Liar.

05:20.400 --> 05:22.450
I have a confession to make.

05:22.600 --> 05:26.250
I'm sleeping next to
a beautiful, young brunette.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.600
<i>You didn't let her stay up
all night watching TV?</i>

05:29.750 --> 05:32.200
Did you?
<i>Of course not.</i>

05:32.324 --> 05:34.300
You're gonna come home right
after the luncheon, right?

05:34.400 --> 05:35.600
<i>Yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>
Okay.

05:35.893 --> 05:36.893
Mommy?

05:36.984 --> 05:38.211
Here's your mother.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.000
<i>Hi, honey!</i>

05:42.424 --> 05:43.843
Hi. I miss you.

05:43.844 --> 05:46.548
<i>I know, I miss you too.
President Whitmore's approval ratings</i>

05:46.649 --> 05:48.679
<i>have slipped below 40%.</i>

05:48.703 --> 05:50.800
<i>Even his crime bill failed to pass.</i>
He's good.

05:51.100 --> 05:54.500
<i>Are the salad days over for
President Whitmore? More talk.</i>

05:54.619 --> 05:56.920
<i>Leadership as a pilot in the Gulf War</i>

05:56.920 --> 05:59.455
<i>is completely different from
leadership in politics.</i>

05:59.600 --> 06:01.450
Daddy let me watch Letterman.

06:01.950 --> 06:03.000
Traitor.

06:03.100 --> 06:06.000
<i>That's the problem.
They elected a warrior and they got a wimp.</i>

06:06.518 --> 06:07.903
Good morning, George.

06:08.004 --> 06:09.323
Good morning, Mr. President.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.700
That game couldn't have been pretty.

06:12.350 --> 06:13.400
Thank you, sir.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.200
Connie, you're up awfully early this morning.

06:19.605 --> 06:21.547
They're not attacking your policies, sir.

06:21.570 --> 06:22.995
They're attacking your age.

06:23.219 --> 06:25.100
Whitmore seems less like the president

06:25.124 --> 06:28.261
and more like the orphan
child Oliver asking.

06:28.285 --> 06:29.932
Please sir, I'd like some more.

06:31.159 --> 06:32.170
That's clever.

06:32.170 --> 06:33.933
Yeah, well, I'm not laughing.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.600
Age was never an issue
when you stuck to your guns.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.000
You were thought of as young, idealistic.
Thanks.

06:39.024 --> 06:39.824
Now...

06:40.075 --> 06:41.702
the message has gotten lost.

06:42.078 --> 06:43.779
It's just too much politics,

06:43.803 --> 06:45.040
too much compromise.

06:45.500 --> 06:49.300
Isn't it amazing how quickly
everyone can turn against you?

06:53.200 --> 06:56.300
It's a fine line between standing behind
a principle and

06:56.624 --> 06:57.749
hiding behind one.

06:58.450 --> 06:59.950
You can tolerate a little compromise,

07:00.000 --> 07:03.350
if you're actually managing
to get something accomplished.

07:04.100 --> 07:05.100
Well...

07:05.350 --> 07:11.100
The Orange County Dispatch has voted you
one of the ten sexiest men of the year.

07:12.950 --> 07:14.000
That's...

07:16.750 --> 07:18.400
That's accomplishing something.

07:18.950 --> 07:20.078
Excuse me, Mr. President.

07:20.603 --> 07:22.074
It's the Secretary of Defense.

07:25.300 --> 07:26.300
Yes.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.650
Could you say that again?

08:02.045 --> 08:04.367
<i>Station WXBY out here in Brooklyn.</i>

08:04.494 --> 08:07.225
<i>The temperature is 95
degrees in Central Park.</i>

08:07.326 --> 08:09.466
<i>What it is here in the borough,
God only knows.</i>

08:09.567 --> 08:10.599
<i>Let's go to Nick Jones.</i>

08:10.623 --> 08:12.325
<i>He'll give us a traffic
report to the beaches...</i>

08:14.900 --> 08:16.300
So what are you waiting?

08:17.200 --> 08:19.500
My Social Security will expire,
you'll still be sitting there.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.320
I'm thinking.

08:21.345 --> 08:23.124
Yeah, well, think already!

08:34.554 --> 08:36.943
If you don't move soon,
I'm gonna start to decompose.

08:43.123 --> 08:44.876
Listen David, I've been meaning
to talk with you.

08:47.303 --> 08:49.422
It's nice that you see me so much now, but...
Don't.

08:49.523 --> 08:50.781
Don't start, Dad.

08:50.808 --> 08:53.114
I'm only saying it's been what?
Four years?

08:53.138 --> 08:54.486
You're still wearing a wedding band?

08:55.029 --> 08:55.957
Three years.

08:55.980 --> 08:58.425
All right, three, four. You're divorced.
Come on. Move on.

08:58.450 --> 08:59.295
This is not healthy.

08:59.319 --> 09:02.174
No, this is not healthy.
Smoking is not healthy.

09:06.933 --> 09:07.933
Checkmate.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.666
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.544
Wait, wait, wait. This is not...

09:12.744 --> 09:13.825
This is not checkmate.

09:13.935 --> 09:14.899
See you tomorrow, Pop.

09:14.923 --> 09:16.675
No, no, just hold on.
This is not checkmate.

09:20.498 --> 09:21.498
Checkmate.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.781
Yes, we've got everybody we have
working on the problem.

09:25.142 --> 09:27.490
I love XFiles, too.
I hope you get to see it.

09:29.992 --> 09:31.701
David! David!

09:31.702 --> 09:34.184
What's the hell's the point of having a beeper
if you're not gonna turn it on?

09:34.208 --> 09:35.822
It was turned on, I was ignoring you.

09:35.946 --> 09:37.123
Hello. What's the...

09:37.248 --> 09:38.336
What's the big emergency?

09:38.623 --> 09:40.022
It started this morning.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.235
Every station's making like it's the 1950s.

09:42.645 --> 09:45.481
We got static. We got snow.
All kinds of distortions.

09:45.682 --> 09:46.922
Nobody knows...

09:47.023 --> 09:49.976
What are you doing? There's a reason
we have bins labeled recycle.

09:50.176 --> 09:51.486
What the hell is going on?

09:51.610 --> 09:52.792
My God in heaven.

09:52.892 --> 09:55.810
So sue me. David!
We got a problem.

09:56.110 --> 09:58.225
Did you, try to switch transponder channels?

09:58.426 --> 10:01.649
Oh, please. You think I'd be this
panicked if it was something simple?

10:01.649 --> 10:04.146
Ok. Let's point the dish at another satellite.

10:04.413 --> 10:06.397
We tried that. It didn't work.

10:06.823 --> 10:09.087
It's almost as though they weren't even there.

10:09.612 --> 10:11.295
All right. What've we got here?

10:17.116 --> 10:18.400
This is impossible.

10:18.525 --> 10:20.419
<i>We created a race of robots.</i>

10:20.544 --> 10:21.726
<i>Their function...</i>

10:22.650 --> 10:24.356
Miguel, the signal's all screwed up.

10:24.756 --> 10:26.341
Stop it. Just leave it alone.

10:26.467 --> 10:27.701
You're gonna break it, all right?

10:27.826 --> 10:29.101
It's so fuzzy.

10:36.863 --> 10:38.367
Oh, no.

10:43.363 --> 10:44.511
Good morning, Lucas.

10:45.310 --> 10:46.717
You see these?

10:47.217 --> 10:49.532
I got a whole god damn crop full of these.

10:49.759 --> 10:51.835
If your father's not in the air in 20 minutes...

10:52.836 --> 10:54.483
I'm getting someone else.

11:03.599 --> 11:04.690
Hey Russell!

11:05.015 --> 11:06.229
Hey, Miguel!

11:20.105 --> 11:21.646
Russell!
What are you doing?

11:37.930 --> 11:39.589
Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?

11:43.726 --> 11:45.565
It's the wrong field, you idiot.

11:45.966 --> 11:48.407
Lucas' farm is on the other side of town.

11:51.692 --> 11:53.175
Are you sure?

12:32.580 --> 12:34.355
CNS is running a story that we're covering up

12:34.379 --> 12:36.235
some type of nuclear testing experiment.

12:36.259 --> 12:38.745
So tell them to run with it if they
want to embarrass themselves.

12:38.769 --> 12:40.260
NASA's been on my butt all morning.

12:40.284 --> 12:41.457
They want to know our position.

12:41.480 --> 12:45.158
Our official position is
we have no official position.

12:45.258 --> 12:47.364
Connie, what is going on here?

12:47.365 --> 12:49.771
Come on guys, would I
keep you out of the loop?

12:49.772 --> 12:51.210
Yes, absolutely.
In a second.

12:51.235 --> 12:52.990
So what?
I can't hear you.

12:53.316 --> 12:55.809
At the moment our satellites are
somewhat unreliable.

12:55.809 --> 12:59.110
Isn't it possible that this thing
may just pass us by?

12:59.235 --> 13:01.017
What if it doesn't pass us by?

13:01.233 --> 13:03.876
Let's retarget some ICBMs
to blow it outta the sky.

13:03.900 --> 13:06.493
And risk turning one dangerous
falling object into many?

13:06.818 --> 13:08.942
We don't yet know enough
about what we're dealing with

13:09.142 --> 13:10.849
to make any kind of intelligent judgments.

13:10.949 --> 13:13.595
Luckily, the press is making up
their own story at this point.

13:14.316 --> 13:15.630
But that's not gonna keep.

13:16.355 --> 13:18.530
We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3.

13:18.530 --> 13:19.622
Absolutely.

13:19.646 --> 13:20.693
General contact NORAD.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.495
You tell them we've upgraded to DEFCON 3.

13:22.519 --> 13:24.049
That's not what the President said.

13:24.073 --> 13:25.430
Don't you think that's a little premature?
I don't think so.

13:25.930 --> 13:29.044
We have over 50% of the armed forces
out on weekend leave.

13:29.045 --> 13:32.904
Not to mention the commanders and troops
that are in town for the 4th of July parade.

13:33.053 --> 13:33.783
Go ahead, Commander.

13:33.785 --> 13:36.665
Our intelligence tells us the object
has settled into a stationary orbit.

13:36.740 --> 13:38.049
Well, that's good news.

13:38.473 --> 13:39.573
Not really, sir.

13:40.349 --> 13:42.709
Part of it has broken off into nearly
three dozen other pieces,

13:43.016 --> 13:44.727
smaller than the whole, sir,

13:45.348 --> 13:47.767
yet over 15 miles in width themselves.

13:51.613 --> 13:52.884
Where are they heading?

13:53.284 --> 13:56.162
They should be entering our atmosphere
within the next 25 minutes.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.200
Take us to DEFCON 3.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.688
Please tell me we're getting somewhere.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.524
Oh, there's good news
and there's bad news.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.200
All right. What's the bad news?

14:21.300 --> 14:23.999
The bad news is there's no
penalty for disturbing my lunch.

14:24.100 --> 14:26.100
And the good news is
you're not gonna charge me.

14:26.650 --> 14:27.663
No, the good news,

14:27.688 --> 14:30.401
is that I found the problem.
It's not our equipment.

14:30.402 --> 14:31.801
It's some kind of weird signal
embedded in the satellite feed.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.500
Wait, that's the good news?

14:34.050 --> 14:36.100
Yeah, 'cause this signal
has a definite sequential pattern.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.000
So as soon as I find
the exact binary sequence,

14:38.100 --> 14:41.900
then I can calculate the phase reversal with that
analyser I bought for your birthday and apply it,

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
we should be able to block it out completely.

14:44.700 --> 14:48.000
And then we'll be the only guys in town
with a clear picture!

14:48.200 --> 14:51.450
Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh, David!
That's why I love you!

14:52.400 --> 14:53.450
That's not necessary.
Yes!

14:53.800 --> 14:54.850
Yes!
Too kind.

15:23.674 --> 15:25.223
This better be good.
Captain on deck!

15:29.149 --> 15:32.838
Sir, we're looking at a total radar
blackout over a 13 km area.

15:33.063 --> 15:35.313
Let's do a diagnostic check...
Excuse me, sir.

15:36.338 --> 15:38.538
The radar may be malfunctioning,
but the infrared

15:38.562 --> 15:39.986
is totally off the map.

15:44.656 --> 15:45.699
Jeez.

15:48.198 --> 15:50.322
Get me Atlantic Command on the line.

15:53.738 --> 15:54.738
Hang on, sir.

15:54.762 --> 15:58.102
Sir, we have visual range
with incoming over Iraqi airspace.

15:58.227 --> 15:59.345
Second sighting?

15:59.369 --> 16:01.502
Yes, sir.
This just came in from the Persian Gulf.

16:03.026 --> 16:04.026
Correction, sir.

16:04.033 --> 16:06.008
<i>We now have two confirmed
visual contacts.</i>

16:06.032 --> 16:07.175
That's affirmative. Mr. President.

16:07.199 --> 16:09.974
They're tracking another one
off the California coastline.

16:11.065 --> 16:12.073
All right, go ahead.
Put it on.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.681
General, you might want to watch this.
Yes.

16:17.270 --> 16:18.480
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

16:18.779 --> 16:19.980
<i>ladies and gentlemen,</i>

16:20.004 --> 16:21.571
<i>we are interrupting our regular broadcast</i>

16:21.595 --> 16:22.937
<i>to bring you extraordinary events</i>

16:22.960 --> 16:24.619
<i>taking place in the Russian Republic.</i>

16:24.643 --> 16:26.153
<i>This unexplained disturbance,</i>

16:26.177 --> 16:29.209
<i>and the hysteria that it's
causing are incredible.</i>

16:29.609 --> 16:32.051
<i>How would you describe,
what you're seeing?</i>

16:32.150 --> 16:34.016
<i>It is clearing the mountains,</i>

16:34.140 --> 16:38.006
<i>moving too slowly to be a comet
or meteor.</i>

16:38.606 --> 16:41.514
<i>Widespread panic has gripped
the countryside</i>

16:41.538 --> 16:44.513
<i>as thousands have taken to the streets.</i>

16:44.680 --> 16:46.005
<i>It is confirmed.</i>

16:46.105 --> 16:49.219
<i>The unexplained phenomenon
is headed for Moscow.</i>

16:49.345 --> 16:51.745
Mr. President, we have
an AWAC off the West Coast.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.992
ETA with contact point, three minutes.

16:55.917 --> 16:58.191
I don't understand it, sir.
Side radar doesn't see it.

16:58.616 --> 17:00.491
I know. It's blind, sir.

17:00.616 --> 17:01.991
Nothing is registering.

17:02.016 --> 17:04.191
Negative.
We have zero visibility.

17:04.214 --> 17:06.214
Visibility is at zero.

17:06.214 --> 17:08.256
Command, this is Eagle Eye 370.

17:09.156 --> 17:10.954
Captain, the president is listening.

17:11.055 --> 17:12.904
Repeat what you just told me.

17:14.545 --> 17:16.984
<i>We still have zero visibility.</i>

17:18.542 --> 17:20.917
<i>Instrumentation is malfunctioning.</i>

17:22.044 --> 17:24.767
<i>We can't get any kind of reading
of what's in front of us.</i>

17:25.291 --> 17:26.326
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

17:27.940 --> 17:29.324
<i>May be clearing.</i>

17:37.288 --> 17:38.829
Pull up! Pull up!

17:49.700 --> 17:50.909
Line's gone, sir.

17:51.234 --> 17:52.908
Two more have been spotted over the Atlantic.

17:53.033 --> 17:54.199
One's moving toward New York,

17:54.324 --> 17:55.282
the other's headed this direction.

17:55.406 --> 17:56.406
How much time do we have?

17:56.407 --> 17:57.281
Less than 10 minutes.

17:57.489 --> 17:58.939
Alex, organize a military escort.

17:59.038 --> 18:00.438
Mr. President, I strongly recommend

18:00.573 --> 18:03.104
we move you to a secure location immediately.

18:03.105 --> 18:05.688
Connie, can we expect the same
kind of panic we saw in Russia?

18:05.788 --> 18:06.862
More than likely.
Mister President.

18:06.987 --> 18:08.461
We can discuss this on the way.

18:08.786 --> 18:10.178
I'm not leaving.

18:11.078 --> 18:13.126
We have to maintain a working government...

18:13.127 --> 18:14.901
I want you to get the vice president,

18:14.925 --> 18:16.466
the whole cabinet and joint chiefs,

18:16.525 --> 18:18.482
and take them to a secured location.

18:18.608 --> 18:19.524
I'm staying.

18:19.649 --> 18:23.057
I don't want to add to a public hysteria
that's gonna cost lives.

18:23.980 --> 18:25.223
Connie.
Yes, sir.

18:25.247 --> 18:27.647
We'll initiate the Emergency
Broadcast System.

18:27.714 --> 18:29.678
We'll advise people, not to panic.

18:29.679 --> 18:32.737
The best idea right now,
is to stay in their homes.

18:33.037 --> 18:34.536
Yes, sir.
Roy. Dean.

18:34.736 --> 18:36.636
Alex, you contact the cabinet members.

18:36.736 --> 18:37.776
Have them rendezvous here.

18:37.810 --> 18:38.927
We'll take them to NORAD.

18:40.326 --> 18:43.159
Mr. President, with your permission,
I'd like to remain at your side.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.308
I had a feeling you would.

18:49.849 --> 18:52.555
And what happens if they do become hostile?

18:54.680 --> 18:56.187
Then God help us.

18:57.013 --> 18:59.420
<i>There it is, the strange atmospheric phenomenon.</i>

18:59.520 --> 19:03.011
<i>It is apparently what has been causing
all the distortions in our broadcasts.</i>

19:03.178 --> 19:04.677
David, are you watching this?

19:07.226 --> 19:09.858
<i>Not to react in a manner of cold fear.</i>

19:10.058 --> 19:14.257
<i>We have no evidence that these
phenomena are endangering anyone.</i>

19:14.757 --> 19:16.622
<i>Thus far reports of aggression,</i>

19:17.720 --> 19:18.921
Marty, listen, listen to this.

19:18.920 --> 19:22.003
I got a lock on the pattern of that
signal, so we can filter it out but...

19:22.304 --> 19:25.053
if my calculations are right, it's going
to be gone in, like seven hours anyway.

19:25.077 --> 19:27.193
It's reducing itself every time it recycles,

19:27.918 --> 19:30.251
so eventually it's gonna disappear...

19:31.075 --> 19:33.300
You listening?
Can you believe this.

19:35.832 --> 19:37.365
David, haven't you been watching?

19:38.189 --> 19:39.256
David!
<i>General.</i>

19:39.380 --> 19:40.379
<i>General.</i>

19:40.680 --> 19:42.022
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

19:42.370 --> 19:45.071
<i>So far, the phenomenon has
not caused any damage.</i>

19:45.170 --> 19:47.394
We have to ask you to try to stay calm,

19:47.418 --> 19:49.586
and it's important for everyone not to panic.

19:49.953 --> 19:53.201
<i>We have a fix on three of the
occurrences about to appear of...</i>

19:53.200 --> 19:54.325
It's just unreal.

19:55.350 --> 19:56.425
Hey, Miguel, come here.

19:56.449 --> 19:58.224
<i>One is headed towards Los Angeles.</i>

19:58.349 --> 20:00.166
<i>The other two are on our eastern seaboard</i>

20:00.265 --> 20:03.390
<i>headed towards New York
and Washington D.C.</i>

20:04.315 --> 20:05.315
Marty. Marty.

20:05.339 --> 20:07.988
Jamie says this building
has an old bomb shelter.

20:08.313 --> 20:09.788
We're heading down there now.

20:10.113 --> 20:13.169
All right, all right everybody,
head down to the basement.

20:13.270 --> 20:14.811
Take it slow.
Don't run.

20:14.820 --> 20:16.486
Walk down to the basement.

20:18.444 --> 20:20.317
There's no shame in hiding.

20:21.143 --> 20:23.019
Oh, I better call my mother.

20:34.398 --> 20:37.247
Well, look who we have here.

20:40.963 --> 20:43.571
Hey, Russ, I heard you had a little trouble
this morning.

20:44.030 --> 20:45.438
Dusted the wrong field.

20:46.862 --> 20:49.529
Well I know you're probably still
a little confused

20:49.628 --> 20:51.494
from your hostage experience.

20:51.594 --> 20:52.927
Hostage experience.

20:53.352 --> 20:54.952
Did something happen to you, Russ?

20:55.150 --> 20:58.249
Oh, yeah. Seems years back, our
boy was kidnapped by aliens.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.848
Did all kind of experiments on him and such.

21:00.849 --> 21:02.150
Tell them about it, Russ.

21:02.150 --> 21:05.007
You get a couple of beers in him,
and he'll tell you all about it, crazy stuff.

21:05.408 --> 21:06.508
Won't you, Russ?

21:07.249 --> 21:08.057
Russ,

21:08.256 --> 21:11.130
when they took you up in their spaceship,
did they do any...

21:12.630 --> 21:14.896
sexual things, do you recall?

21:15.022 --> 21:16.130
Do you recollect?

21:20.620 --> 21:21.527
Oh, Russ!

21:34.549 --> 21:35.723
Let's get outta here.

21:36.048 --> 21:38.290
What's going on? What's going on?

21:45.630 --> 21:46.705
What's that?

21:47.305 --> 21:48.554
Let's get outta here.
Come on.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.771
Mommy! Lookit!

22:18.579 --> 22:20.421
It's too early, baby.

22:26.787 --> 22:28.195
Is it a earthquake?

22:28.395 --> 22:30.460
Not even a four pointer.

22:30.785 --> 22:32.193
Go back to sleep.

22:48.322 --> 22:49.197
Daddy!

22:51.904 --> 22:54.029
What are you doing here?

22:54.195 --> 22:56.027
You should be down in the shelter.

22:56.153 --> 22:57.403
What's going on?

23:31.145 --> 23:32.145
Aren't you coming, David?

23:32.510 --> 23:33.535
No. I gotta see this.

23:53.763 --> 23:55.179
That's cool, man!

24:36.169 --> 24:37.502
You jerk!

25:00.329 --> 25:01.454
The signal.

25:03.204 --> 25:04.037
My God.

25:21.724 --> 25:23.157
Now what do we do?

25:24.524 --> 25:25.731
Address the nation.

25:26.456 --> 25:28.782
There's gonna be a lot of
frightened people out there.

25:29.082 --> 25:30.082
Yeah.

25:30.923 --> 25:32.580
I'm one of them.

25:37.087 --> 25:39.436
Come on.
He's just trying to impress you.

25:40.236 --> 25:42.836
If you want to impress me,
you need to get a job,

25:42.936 --> 25:44.660
and stop slobbering all over my shoe.

26:00.856 --> 26:02.564
I don't believe this. Jasmine.

26:02.863 --> 26:04.772
Neighbors moving out.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.721
Guess they finally got tired of all these quakes.

26:10.020 --> 26:12.220
A little shake and they running.

26:13.020 --> 26:16.635
<i>Police and the fire departments are
asking everyone to stay off the phone.</i>

26:17.235 --> 26:18.901
Baby, there's something on
the news about the quake.

26:19.809 --> 26:22.134
<i>The police are asking us not to call 911.</i>

26:22.234 --> 26:23.808
What's up, man?
Hi daddy.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.216
What you been doing out there?

26:25.342 --> 26:26.750
Shooting the aliens.

26:26.774 --> 26:28.557
Oh, you shooting aliens, right?

26:28.580 --> 26:30.148
You think you tough?
What you got?

26:30.174 --> 26:31.747
Turn around.
Let me see what you got.

26:31.770 --> 26:33.681
Come on, Boomer.
Let's get you something to eat.

26:34.005 --> 26:35.013
Oh, no...

26:36.638 --> 26:38.671
Watch out. Watch it now, baby.

26:38.972 --> 26:40.196
I'll go grab the paper.
All right.

26:43.620 --> 26:44.580
Dam...

26:57.550 --> 26:58.883
Honey, let's go!

27:15.362 --> 27:17.637
Babe, you want some of this coffee?

27:18.337 --> 27:19.344
Babe.

27:25.793 --> 27:29.167
<i>Pentagon officials are reporting
more ships have just arrived</i>

27:29.290 --> 27:30.667
<i>over the capitals of India,</i>

27:30.790 --> 27:32.166
<i>England and Germany,</i>

27:32.290 --> 27:35.165
<i>bringing estimates up to
anywhere from 10 to 15</i>

27:35.289 --> 27:37.614
<i>of these city-sized spacecraft.</i>

27:37.714 --> 27:40.396
I know, Ma. Just try and stay calm.

27:40.622 --> 27:42.496
Tell her to pack up and leave town.

27:42.620 --> 27:43.854
Why?
What happened?

27:44.079 --> 27:45.154
Just do it!

27:45.579 --> 27:46.954
Oh, Ma. Ma, listen.

27:47.079 --> 27:49.620
Get your stuff together and head
for Aunt Esther's.

27:50.245 --> 27:51.886
Don't argue with me. Just go!

27:52.810 --> 27:55.418
David, why did I just send
my mother to Atlanta?

27:56.243 --> 27:57.285
David.

27:57.410 --> 27:58.726
David, talk to me.

27:58.750 --> 28:01.075
Did you hear me tell you that the
signal hidden in the satellite feed

28:01.375 --> 28:02.975
is slowly recycling down to extinction?

28:03.075 --> 28:04.891
Not really.
It's a countdown.

28:05.290 --> 28:06.366
A countdown?

28:06.574 --> 28:08.623
Wait. A countdown to what, David?

28:10.623 --> 28:11.756
It's like in chess.

28:11.956 --> 28:13.756
First you strategically position your pieces,

28:14.155 --> 28:16.488
then when the timing's right you strike.

28:17.313 --> 28:18.345
See?

28:19.170 --> 28:20.978
They're positioning themselves
all over the world,

28:21.504 --> 28:23.585
using this one signal
to synchronize their efforts.

28:23.609 --> 28:25.185
In approximately six hours,

28:25.285 --> 28:27.852
the signal's going to disappear,
and the countdown's going to be over.

28:28.152 --> 28:29.685
And then what?

28:31.900 --> 28:33.000
Checkmate.

28:35.608 --> 28:36.649
Oh, my God.

28:36.774 --> 28:37.941
Oh, my God!

28:38.066 --> 28:39.648
I've got to call my brother.

28:39.773 --> 28:41.147
I'd better call my housekeeper.

28:41.272 --> 28:42.547
I gotta call my lawyer.

28:43.372 --> 28:44.546
Forget my lawyer.

28:45.270 --> 28:48.506
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.</i>

28:48.530 --> 28:49.543
<i>Good afternoon.</i>

28:50.469 --> 28:52.023
<i>My fellow Americans,</i>

28:53.048 --> 28:56.041
<i>a historic and unprecedented
event has occurred.</i>

28:56.266 --> 28:59.294
<i>The question of whether or not
we're alone in the universe</i>

28:59.496 --> 29:00.771
has been answered.

29:01.895 --> 29:03.412
Although it's understandable that,

29:03.436 --> 29:05.868
many of us feel a sense
of hesitation or even fear

29:05.882 --> 29:08.324
we must attempt to reserve judgment...

29:08.629 --> 29:10.615
He says he's your husband.

29:11.716 --> 29:13.593
Oh, God.

29:16.104 --> 29:17.235
What do you want?

29:17.960 --> 29:19.661
You got to leave the White House.

29:19.760 --> 29:22.332
This is hardly the time nor the place
to be having that same old discussion!

29:22.433 --> 29:24.475
You don't understand.
You got to leave Washington.

29:24.600 --> 29:25.778
Well, in case you haven't noticed,

29:25.802 --> 29:28.145
we are having a little crisis here.

29:28.169 --> 29:29.791
They're communicating with a hidden signal.

29:29.916 --> 29:31.031
They're going to attack.

29:31.256 --> 29:32.846
You are just being paranoid!

29:32.870 --> 29:35.741
It's not paranoia.
The embedding's very subtle.

29:35.742 --> 29:36.982
It's probably been overlooked.

29:45.349 --> 29:46.365
Marty, what are you doing?

29:46.789 --> 29:47.991
Get out of town as soon as you can.

29:48.123 --> 29:49.405
<i>Please, my staff and I</i>
Ok. Ok.

29:49.430 --> 29:50.878
<i>Will remain in the White House</i>

29:50.978 --> 29:52.727
<i>as we attempt to establish communication.</i>

29:53.940 --> 29:56.662
<i>If you feel compelled to leave these cities,</i>

29:56.662 --> 29:59.031
<i>please do so in an orderly fashion.</i>

30:04.487 --> 30:05.910
Hey! What's going on?

30:07.126 --> 30:08.038
Excuse me.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.218
Coming through.

30:10.933 --> 30:12.312
<i>The arrival of the alien visitors</i>

30:12.336 --> 30:14.400
<i>has caused over 10,000 fender-benders</i>

30:14.424 --> 30:15.823
<i>in just a few seconds' time,</i>

30:15.923 --> 30:17.413
<i>but this is just the beginning...</i>

30:18.213 --> 30:19.497
Come on now, you can't go.

30:19.523 --> 30:20.863
You got to call them back.

30:21.510 --> 30:23.073
I'm not going to do this with you, Jasmine.

30:23.698 --> 30:25.205
I've got to report to El Toro.

30:25.330 --> 30:27.257
But you said you was on leave for the 4th.

30:27.383 --> 30:28.638
Yeah, well, they canceled it!

30:31.365 --> 30:33.192
Look, why are you acting like this?

30:33.792 --> 30:34.987
Why?

30:38.800 --> 30:39.845
That's why.

30:49.372 --> 30:50.387
Look.

30:51.112 --> 30:53.801
I really don't think they flew 90 billion light years,

30:54.127 --> 30:55.702
to come down here and start a fight

30:56.227 --> 30:57.585
and get all rowdy.

30:59.087 --> 31:00.449
Look why don't you just relax?

31:00.549 --> 31:02.949
I'm going to report to El Toro
and find out what's going on.

31:07.524 --> 31:08.945
What are you doing in there, man?

31:09.404 --> 31:11.044
Nothing. I'm just driving.

31:13.807 --> 31:15.381
Look. Here, I got these for you.

31:15.482 --> 31:16.553
Firecrackers.

31:16.653 --> 31:17.693
Now, you be careful.

31:17.993 --> 31:18.947
Steve, wait.

31:19.073 --> 31:20.233
I want to tell you something.

31:20.270 --> 31:21.372
What is it, Jasmine?

31:25.643 --> 31:27.347
You take care of yourself, you hear?

31:30.666 --> 31:31.666
Look.

31:33.283 --> 31:35.027
Why don't you get some things packed,

31:35.027 --> 31:36.969
and you and Dylan come stay
with me on the base.

31:39.120 --> 31:41.494
And you will see that there is nothing
to be scared of.

31:42.226 --> 31:43.290
Really?

31:44.728 --> 31:46.043
You don't mind?

31:46.744 --> 31:47.749
Well, I mean...

31:48.550 --> 31:50.642
We'll have to let all my other girlfriends know

31:50.666 --> 31:52.523
that they can't come over, you know,

31:52.547 --> 31:54.632
and got to postpone a little freaky-deaky.
There you go,

31:54.656 --> 31:56.572
there he goes, thinking you all that.

31:57.480 --> 32:00.154
But you are not as charming
as you think you are, sir.

32:01.354 --> 32:02.454
Yes, I am.

32:03.479 --> 32:05.273
Them big old Dumbo ears.

32:05.773 --> 32:07.500
Look at you with them chicken legs.

32:15.910 --> 32:17.106
Come on Dylan, honey.

32:22.314 --> 32:24.406
Look out!
Look out!

32:32.025 --> 32:32.938
What?
Hey!

32:33.038 --> 32:35.096
The television said they started
the looting already, heven't they?

32:35.620 --> 32:36.673
Vultures.

32:37.349 --> 32:38.470
You still have the Plymouth?

32:38.753 --> 32:40.078
You want to borrow the car?

32:40.202 --> 32:41.585
David, you don't have a license.

32:41.902 --> 32:42.780
You're driving.

32:42.906 --> 32:44.489
Yeah, I'm driv...
I'm driving?

32:44.513 --> 32:45.593
Come on, come on.

32:47.845 --> 32:49.805
I really want you out of Los Angeles.

32:50.056 --> 32:51.990
You're staying there to keep people calm.

32:51.990 --> 32:54.868
It's the right thing to do. I'm not
going to let them criticize you for it.

32:54.892 --> 32:56.637
I appreciate it, your trying to help me.

32:56.737 --> 32:57.527
Liar.

32:58.152 --> 32:59.721
Stick to the truth it's what you're good at.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.015
All right. I'll tell you the truth.

33:01.039 --> 33:02.675
I don't want you in any one of those cities.

33:04.175 --> 33:06.001
I'll leave as soon as the interviews are done.

33:06.610 --> 33:07.366
All right.

33:07.666 --> 33:10.165
There's a helicopter waiting.
They're gonna take you to Nellis.

33:10.465 --> 33:11.465
<i>And the munchkin?</i>

33:11.489 --> 33:12.775
She's going to meet you there.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.235
All right.

33:14.335 --> 33:15.561
I love you.

33:16.586 --> 33:17.838
I love you.

33:17.937 --> 33:18.888
<i>Bye.</i>

33:20.339 --> 33:21.098
Bye.

33:25.669 --> 33:27.564
It's the White House for grying out loud!

33:27.589 --> 33:29.338
You can't just drive up and ring a bell.

33:29.514 --> 33:30.903
Can't this thing go any faster?

33:30.927 --> 33:32.183
What, you think they don't
know what you know?

33:32.207 --> 33:33.659
They know. Believe me, they know.

33:33.926 --> 33:36.102
She works for the president.
They know everything.

33:36.427 --> 33:37.471
They don't know this.

33:38.170 --> 33:39.256
You're going to educate them?

33:39.356 --> 33:41.155
Yeah so tell me something.
You're so smart.

33:41.156 --> 33:44.075
How come you spend eight years at M.I.T
to become a cable repairman?

33:44.099 --> 33:44.798
Dad!

33:44.799 --> 33:47.312
No all I'm saying is they got people
who handle these things, David.

33:48.112 --> 33:49.547
They want HBO, they'll call you.

33:50.572 --> 33:51.633
Look at these, look at these people.
Look?

33:52.640 --> 33:54.519
Vultures.
They take, and then they go.

33:54.619 --> 33:56.362
They're going, they're going faster than we are.

33:56.386 --> 33:57.554
Look at this we're in the fast lane.

33:57.578 --> 33:58.854
I can't go faster.
They're cutting me off here.

33:58.878 --> 34:00.823
No one's cutting you off.
We're going to get a ticket.

34:00.847 --> 34:02.149
They're getting in front of me.
I can't go any faster.

34:02.173 --> 34:03.801
All right. All right.
I don't want to argue you.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.582
Let's just get there,

34:05.607 --> 34:07.104
as quickly as possible.
What's the rush?

34:07.203 --> 34:09.056
You think we'll get to Washington,
it won't be there?

34:11.782 --> 34:13.768
<i>A local crop duster was arrested today</i>

34:13.792 --> 34:16.085
<i>as he papered city hall
with leaflets from the air.</i>

34:16.210 --> 34:17.295
Everybody's leaving.

34:17.420 --> 34:18.295
<i>Can you give us some of your time?</i>

34:18.420 --> 34:19.339
<i>Do you want to make a statement?</i>

34:19.463 --> 34:20.630
<i>We've got to stop them!</i>

34:20.755 --> 34:23.634
<i>I was kidnapped by space aliens 10 years ago.</i>

34:23.759 --> 34:25.710
<i>They did all kinds of experiments on me.</i>

34:25.810 --> 34:28.922
<i>They've been studying us for years,
finding out our weaknesses.</i>

34:29.020 --> 34:30.424
<i>We've gotta stop them!</i>

34:30.524 --> 34:32.000
<i>They're gonna kill us all!</i>

34:32.400 --> 34:34.594
<i>Some people attribute his eccentric behavior</i>

34:34.693 --> 34:36.594
<i>to post-traumatic stress syndrome</i>

34:36.695 --> 34:38.855
<i>from his service as a pilot in Vietnam.</i>

34:39.022 --> 34:41.453
<i>Others, however, have a more unusual theory.</i>

34:41.553 --> 34:43.141
<i>How would you describe Mr. Casse?</i>

34:43.242 --> 34:44.643
<i>Private.
Keeps to himself.</i>

34:44.743 --> 34:46.143
<i>Real quiet.
Quiet.</i>

34:46.244 --> 34:47.987
<i>When they took him up in the spaceship,</i>

34:48.905 --> 34:51.558
<i>the aliens abused him...</i>

34:51.783 --> 34:53.234
<i>sexually.</i>

34:53.534 --> 34:55.886
<i>Mr. Casse is in the county lockup
this evening...</i>

34:56.585 --> 34:57.722
Pack up.
We're leaving.

34:58.422 --> 34:59.847
<i>Due to extenuating circumstances,</i>

34:59.870 --> 35:01.483
<i>he may be released later tonight.</i>

35:01.883 --> 35:03.551
Miguel, what about Dad?

35:05.376 --> 35:07.279
This could be our last night on Earth.

35:09.103 --> 35:10.557
You don't want to die a virgin...

35:10.782 --> 35:11.842
do you?

35:12.667 --> 35:13.669
Come on, we're going.

35:13.693 --> 35:15.120
No. I'm not going anywhere.

35:16.220 --> 35:17.284
Miguel!

35:17.384 --> 35:18.384
Stop it!

35:23.259 --> 35:24.501
Thanks a lot, partner.

35:27.478 --> 35:29.456
You read my mind!

35:30.150 --> 35:31.400
Stay here.

35:32.050 --> 35:34.900
We gotta get as far away
from these things as we can!

35:35.200 --> 35:36.425
They let you out?

35:36.450 --> 35:37.574
You damn right!

35:37.800 --> 35:40.800
They got bigger fish to fry now,
believe you me!

35:40.950 --> 35:42.200
Come on, boy!

35:42.650 --> 35:44.750
We're leaving without you.

35:45.550 --> 35:48.200
We're going to live with Uncle Hector
in Tucson.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.250
Hector!

35:52.600 --> 35:53.961
Like hell you are.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.824
I'm still your father.

35:55.950 --> 35:57.250
No, you're not.

35:57.900 --> 36:00.250
You're just the man who married my mother.

36:01.400 --> 36:02.700
You're nothing to me!

36:08.950 --> 36:11.000
Well, what about Troy?

36:11.150 --> 36:11.950
Troy?

36:12.274 --> 36:13.049
Yeah.

36:13.050 --> 36:16.250
For once in your life, why don't you
think about what's best for him?

36:16.950 --> 36:19.600
Who has to beg for money to buy him
medicine when you screw up!

36:20.200 --> 36:21.700
Who? Who?

36:22.500 --> 36:23.950
You stop it right now!

36:24.900 --> 36:26.900
I'm not a baby anymore!

36:27.250 --> 36:31.200
I don't want your stupid medicine,
because I'm so sick of medicine!

36:31.700 --> 36:33.400
Do you know what this stuff costs?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.550
Do you wanna get sick again?

36:37.050 --> 36:38.100
Do you?

36:39.892 --> 36:42.535
<i>Once again, the L.A.P.D.
Is asking Los Angelenos</i>

36:42.536 --> 36:45.363
<i>not to fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft.</i>

36:45.463 --> 36:48.373
<i>You may inadvertently trigger an interstellar war.</i>

36:48.990 --> 36:51.627
Think we can find something better
to do with our time, gentlemen?

36:52.127 --> 36:53.754
Where you been, Stevie?

36:54.120 --> 36:56.556
Man, this is unbelievable.
This is, like, huge.

36:56.580 --> 36:58.457
They. They've recalled everybody.

36:59.082 --> 37:00.801
Well, looks like the mail's still working.

37:06.179 --> 37:07.823
You got to do the honors for me, man.

37:08.048 --> 37:09.048
You're a wuss.

37:09.072 --> 37:10.426
Yeah, whatever, shut up and read it.

37:11.552 --> 37:12.670
It says...

37:13.270 --> 37:15.172
Captain Steven Hiller,

37:15.470 --> 37:15.971
loser.

37:16.113 --> 37:17.931
United States Marine Corps.

37:19.649 --> 37:22.026
We regret to inform you that,

37:22.150 --> 37:24.545
despite your excellent record of service...

37:27.064 --> 37:28.537
I'm sorry, man.

37:29.837 --> 37:31.335
You know what you need to do?

37:31.860 --> 37:35.321
You need to, like, kiss some serious booty
to get ahead in this world, man.

37:35.446 --> 37:36.948
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.549
See, I like the one-knee approach because,

37:39.857 --> 37:41.866
it puts the booty, like right...

37:42.090 --> 37:44.152
in front of the lips, what's this?

37:44.513 --> 37:46.189
That's nothing.
Hold on. Hold on, man.

37:46.194 --> 37:47.287
What is this?

37:47.907 --> 37:50.409
Jasmine kind of has a thing for dolphins.
I don't know.

37:50.433 --> 37:53.128
Stevie, this is a wedding ring.

37:58.230 --> 38:00.768
I thought you said you were going
to break the whole thing off.

38:02.219 --> 38:03.019
Yeah.

38:06.180 --> 38:08.109
Man, you know I really like Jasmine.

38:08.434 --> 38:09.696
You know that, right?

38:11.356 --> 38:13.164
Man, you're never going to get to fly

38:13.188 --> 38:15.223
the Space Shuttle if you marry a stripper.

38:23.860 --> 38:25.928
<i>It could only happen in California file,</i>

38:25.929 --> 38:27.757
<i>here's Wendy Walsh with a special report.</i>

38:28.257 --> 38:31.288
<i>Below us, we can see hundreds of UFO fanatics</i>

38:31.413 --> 38:35.922
<i>who have gathered on rooftops here in downtown
Los Angeles to welcome the new arrivals.</i>

38:36.048 --> 38:38.426
<i>Oh, God! I hope they bring back Elvis!</i>

38:38.552 --> 38:42.475
I just came in to get my check tonight,
and I got talked into working.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.871
Oh, I must have been tripping.

38:44.896 --> 38:46.968
<i>It's being called the party event of the century,</i>

38:46.992 --> 38:49.787
<i>and everyone is invited,
especially you know who.</i>

38:49.829 --> 38:51.274
This is so cool.

38:51.374 --> 38:52.401
Girl, please.

38:52.500 --> 38:53.542
Oh, hey.

38:54.067 --> 38:56.090
I made it before I came in tonight.

38:57.690 --> 38:58.837
Check it out.

38:59.937 --> 39:02.776
Now I know you're not thinking
about joining those idiots.

39:02.976 --> 39:05.230
I am going over there as soon as I get off.

39:05.597 --> 39:06.645
Do you wanna come?

39:07.245 --> 39:08.976
Tiffany, listen to me a second.

39:09.012 --> 39:12.557
I have got a really bad feeling about this.
I don't want you to go.

39:12.750 --> 39:15.900
Oh, like the really bad feeling you got
when I went to Las Vegas?

39:16.050 --> 39:17.163
Yeah. And I was right.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.024
You didn't get the job and you
lost all your money gambling.

39:20.450 --> 39:23.450
Yeah, but I wasn't in L.A. for the earthquake.

39:24.650 --> 39:26.950
Tiff, I really don't want you to go up there.

39:27.000 --> 39:28.750
Now promise me you won't.

39:29.643 --> 39:31.843
Come on girl, promise me!
No, no, no.

39:33.067 --> 39:34.067
I promise.

39:35.868 --> 39:36.668
Ok.

39:38.246 --> 39:39.046
Look.

39:39.260 --> 39:40.361
I'm going.

39:41.085 --> 39:42.449
I'm out of town for a while.

39:42.850 --> 39:44.153
Later.
Bye.

39:45.700 --> 39:47.650
Hey, there's my angel.
Come on.

39:48.450 --> 39:49.800
Come on, Boomer. Let's go.

39:50.150 --> 39:51.900
Hey, come on.
Talk to your boyfriend later.

39:52.250 --> 39:54.100
Hey! What the hell's the kid doing here?

39:55.200 --> 39:57.100
Get out of here!
You try finding a sitter today.

39:57.124 --> 39:58.700
Hey! Hey, where do you
think you're you going?

39:58.900 --> 40:00.493
You leave, you're fired.

40:00.718 --> 40:02.574
Nice working with you, Mario.

40:02.800 --> 40:04.200
Come on, Boomer.

40:10.987 --> 40:13.028
Everyone in the world is trying
to get out of Washington.

40:13.049 --> 40:14.689
We're the only schmucks trying to get in.

40:17.473 --> 40:18.700
What. What the hell is that?

40:19.768 --> 40:22.056
Pops, this is every phone book in America.

40:22.156 --> 40:24.900
You think an important person
like Constance is going to be listed?

40:25.100 --> 40:28.459
She always keeps her portable phone
listed for emergencies.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.364
Sometimes it's her just first initial,

40:30.389 --> 40:32.174
sometimes it's her nickname,

40:32.400 --> 40:33.791
sometimes just her...

40:33.815 --> 40:35.409
Oy, my God!

40:35.410 --> 40:36.910
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Slow down!

40:39.500 --> 40:41.900
Where are they going?
Please stop!

40:41.924 --> 40:43.024
Tell them! Tell them!

40:45.100 --> 40:46.100
Slow down!

40:46.100 --> 40:47.450
Off-ramp!

40:50.050 --> 40:51.400
Slow down!

40:52.750 --> 40:54.950
We made it! We made it!
Good, good.

40:58.300 --> 40:59.600
Nice driving, Pops.

40:59.600 --> 41:00.650
Well...

41:03.550 --> 41:04.550
So, not listed?

41:04.650 --> 41:06.700
No, no. I just haven't found it yet.

41:07.700 --> 41:09.690
I tried C. Spano, Connie Spano,

41:10.115 --> 41:11.324
Spunky Spano.

41:11.900 --> 41:13.000
Spunky?

41:14.150 --> 41:15.150
College nickname.

41:16.275 --> 41:17.275
Cute.

41:17.900 --> 41:19.244
You tried Levinson?

41:19.345 --> 41:20.924
No she didn't take my name
when we were married.

41:21.150 --> 41:22.150
Why would she...
What are you talking about?

41:22.170 --> 41:23.170
Try it.

41:24.200 --> 41:25.950
Okay. Here. Look.

41:32.300 --> 41:33.450
So, what do I know?

41:44.378 --> 41:45.180
So...

41:46.105 --> 41:47.810
You want to ring the bell or should I?

41:50.415 --> 41:51.785
Oh, perfect. She's using it.

41:51.809 --> 41:53.570
Perfect. What's perfect?
It's busy.

41:54.337 --> 41:55.948
Yeah. I can use her signal,

41:56.773 --> 41:59.694
to triangulate her exact position
in the White House.

42:00.580 --> 42:01.721
You can do that?

42:02.020 --> 42:04.879
Yeah. All cable repairmen can, Pops.

42:04.880 --> 42:08.662
<i>The visitors have arrived, but the president
remains at the White House.</i>

42:08.854 --> 42:09.863
<i>Question.</i>

42:10.088 --> 42:13.613
<i>Are Mr. Whitmore's actions A, ultra brave.</i>

42:13.637 --> 42:15.367
<i>Or B, foolhardy?</i>

42:16.733 --> 42:18.672
What?
<i>Now, don't hang up, sweetie.</i>

42:19.039 --> 42:21.282
David. How did you get this number?

42:21.883 --> 42:23.302
<i>Do me a favor.
Walk to the window.</i>

42:23.995 --> 42:25.724
And I'm looking for what?

42:25.924 --> 42:27.137
<i>You'll see.</i>

42:27.662 --> 42:28.882
<i>Over here.</i>

42:31.893 --> 42:32.769
<i>See us?</i>

42:33.813 --> 42:35.042
How does he do that?

42:35.642 --> 42:38.472
Reporting live from Andrews Air Force Base

42:38.597 --> 42:40.342
just outside Washington, D.C...

42:40.442 --> 42:42.771
Yes, that's right, Tom, an amazing moment.

42:42.896 --> 42:44.440
We're reporting from Andrews Air Force Base...

42:44.607 --> 42:47.912
Now in light of our apparent inability
to communicate with the visitors,

42:48.012 --> 42:51.459
Pentagon officials have retrofit
this skylift helicopter

42:51.585 --> 42:53.997
with a type of visual communications device.

42:53.998 --> 42:56.026
Mr. President.
Gentlemen, be seated.

42:56.050 --> 42:58.145
<i>This is not a military airgraft
but as you can see,</i>

42:58.146 --> 42:59.349
Where are we now?

42:59.349 --> 43:00.850
They're just commencing liftoff.

43:00.975 --> 43:03.764
<i>And refitted with these enormous
light panels that are</i>

43:04.164 --> 43:06.744
<i>attached to the hull and onto the sides.</i>

43:06.844 --> 43:08.874
<i>Echo One, Welcome Wagon is in the air.</i>

43:09.274 --> 43:11.352
I repeat. Welcome Wagon is in the air.

43:11.477 --> 43:14.424
<i>Roger, Welcome Wagon.
Echo One right beside you.</i>

43:15.025 --> 43:16.784
This is something I would never
believe in my lifetime,

43:16.809 --> 43:18.338
that I would be in the White House.

43:18.480 --> 43:19.575
Look at this.

43:20.443 --> 43:22.169
If I knew I was going to meet the president,

43:22.193 --> 43:23.206
I would have worn a tie.

43:23.230 --> 43:25.352
Yeah I mean, look at me.
I look like a schlemiel.

43:25.677 --> 43:27.054
You look fine, Pops.

43:27.379 --> 43:29.016
Oy, my God.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.178
David, I don't know how happy
he's going to be to see you.

43:31.179 --> 43:32.965
Yeah, that's right. I'm telling you,
we're wasting time.

43:32.989 --> 43:34.468
Like he's not going to listen to me.
We should go?

43:34.492 --> 43:36.114
Why wouldn't he?
Why wouldn't he listen?

43:36.138 --> 43:38.073
Because last time I saw him we,
we got into a fight.

43:38.198 --> 43:40.198
You walked in the room
and punched him in the head.

43:40.700 --> 43:41.741
You punched the president?

43:41.759 --> 43:44.518
He wasn't the president then.
I punched him, he fought back.

43:44.542 --> 43:45.742
We wrestled around. It was a fight.

43:45.766 --> 43:47.099
A fight that you started,

43:47.100 --> 43:49.183
because David thought that
I was having an affair.

43:49.184 --> 43:51.217
With the president?
Which, of course, I wasn't...

43:51.240 --> 43:53.934
Hey, hey! You know, either go get him,
or we should head back to the car.

43:54.059 --> 43:56.923
All right. I'll get him.
You wait here, and don't touch anything.

43:58.122 --> 43:59.402
You punched the president?

43:59.702 --> 44:01.280
Mein Gott!

44:10.060 --> 44:11.573
Nearing point of contact, Echo One.

44:11.672 --> 44:12.741
We're closing in.

44:12.940 --> 44:15.469
<i>Roger that. You're a go to
commence sequence when ready.</i>

44:17.800 --> 44:19.100
This I like.

44:20.850 --> 44:21.900
Look at this!

44:23.100 --> 44:24.550
You know what famous people
have been here?

44:25.800 --> 44:26.750
Yes, Dad.

44:26.750 --> 44:28.150
Politicians, actors...

44:28.900 --> 44:30.450
Baseball players, singers...

44:31.150 --> 44:32.400
And now me.

44:33.500 --> 44:35.650
Imagine that!
Look, a poor immigrant like me.

44:35.800 --> 44:37.400
It's a dream!
David, please!

44:37.970 --> 44:40.123
<i>The three choppers are
steadily approaching</i>

44:40.124 --> 44:44.372
<i>what has been unanimously agreed
to be the front of these spaceships,</i>

44:44.515 --> 44:47.318
<i>a parabolic indentation 9 city blocks...</i>

44:47.319 --> 44:48.455
You're leaving now?

44:49.330 --> 44:51.510
Hey, see if they got those pens
that they give away.

44:51.636 --> 44:52.687
Dad, what?

44:52.710 --> 44:54.711
You'd still think I have
a choice of my company.

44:55.927 --> 44:57.213
I don't have time for this.

44:57.613 --> 44:58.707
Two minutes, Tom.
Connie...

44:58.732 --> 45:00.232
Mr. President. Mr. President.

45:00.233 --> 45:02.386
Julius Levinson.
David is my son.

45:02.387 --> 45:04.192
I told you he wouldn't listen.
Νο, you have to tell him now.

45:04.792 --> 45:06.435
Tell him. David, you have to tell him!
Hey Connie!

45:06.435 --> 45:07.630
David, tell him!

45:11.475 --> 45:13.465
I know why we have satellite disruption.

45:16.628 --> 45:17.628
All right. Go ahead.

45:18.480 --> 45:19.390
Ok.

45:21.427 --> 45:25.718
Let's say that you want to coordinate with
spaceships on different sides of the Earth.

45:26.243 --> 45:28.373
You couldn't send a direct signal, right?

45:30.183 --> 45:31.520
You're talking about line of sight.

45:31.946 --> 45:34.010
Yeah, that's right, that's right. Exactly.
The curve of the Earth prevents it.

45:34.034 --> 45:36.319
If you'd need satellites to relay that signal

45:36.320 --> 45:37.673
in order to reach each ship.

45:38.773 --> 45:40.184
Well, I found a signal,

45:40.208 --> 45:41.991
hidden inside,

45:42.615 --> 45:44.026
our own satellite system.

45:46.687 --> 45:48.289
Excuse me, Mr. President.

45:48.615 --> 45:49.710
They're starting.

45:52.856 --> 45:55.137
They're using our own satellites against us...

45:58.667 --> 46:00.003
and the clock is ticking.

46:04.969 --> 46:05.938
Bringing it in to hover.

46:06.337 --> 46:07.297
<i>Welcome Wagon, Echo One.</i>

46:07.940 --> 46:09.701
<i>Approaching alien ship.</i>

46:11.020 --> 46:13.650
Initiating communications sequence,
Echo One.

46:15.127 --> 46:16.900
Welcome Wagon has commenced.

46:23.575 --> 46:25.786
General Grey, coordinate
with the Atlantic Command.

46:25.787 --> 46:28.827
Tell them to evacuate as many people
out of the cities as they can.

46:28.850 --> 46:29.851
Yes, sir.

46:30.220 --> 46:31.596
Get those helicopters away from the ship.

46:31.597 --> 46:32.834
Call them back immediately.

46:32.858 --> 46:34.036
What the hell's going on?

46:34.060 --> 46:35.060
We're leaving.

46:35.537 --> 46:36.688
Kim, my daughter.

46:39.100 --> 46:40.529
There's something happening here.

46:44.410 --> 46:45.421
They're responding.

46:45.520 --> 46:46.523
<i>Something's opening.</i>

46:46.523 --> 46:47.583
Something is happening.

46:50.630 --> 46:52.609
It looks like there's some kind of activity here.

46:52.709 --> 46:54.737
This may be some type of response,
Echo One.

46:54.937 --> 46:56.874
<i>We see it, too.
Can't identify it.</i>

47:09.352 --> 47:12.602
We are evacuating. I repeat.
We are evacuating the White House.

47:15.002 --> 47:17.259
Load the rest of the staff
in the second helicopter.

47:17.385 --> 47:18.838
Who should we pick?

47:19.863 --> 47:20.992
Is my wife in the air?

47:21.092 --> 47:22.352
She will be shortly.

47:22.719 --> 47:24.087
Nice.
Very nice.

47:24.312 --> 47:26.242
Ok. Buckle up.
Latch secure.

47:26.942 --> 47:28.820
Look, we have our own phone.

47:32.077 --> 47:33.454
Let's move outta here!

47:35.499 --> 47:38.680
The president's ordered an evacuation.
We have to leave now.

47:39.005 --> 47:42.126
<i>And our prayers go out to the wives
and children of those brave pilots.</i>

47:42.127 --> 47:44.338
<i>Indeed, God help us all.</i>

47:44.362 --> 47:45.262
Come on.

47:45.263 --> 47:47.627
<i>The visitors responded with terrifying...</i>

47:47.727 --> 47:51.334
<i>Authorities have called for a complete
evacuation of Los Angeles County.</i>

47:51.534 --> 47:54.439
<i>People are advised to avoid the highways
wherever possible.</i>

47:54.639 --> 47:56.494
Oh, yeah. Great.
Now he tells me.

48:02.744 --> 48:05.582
<i>This is the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

48:05.707 --> 48:10.492
<i>Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.</i>

48:12.186 --> 48:13.231
Take me!

48:13.356 --> 48:14.399
Take me!

48:26.786 --> 48:28.422
Can we move it along?

48:29.215 --> 48:30.215
<i>Dr. Katz's office.</i>

48:30.239 --> 48:31.795
Hello. Let me speak to...
<i>Dr. Katz,</i>

48:31.819 --> 48:33.056
Please.
<i>I'm sorry. He's not available.</i>

48:33.057 --> 48:36.537
Listen, for $300 an hour, you can put me
through to his house in the Hamptons!

48:44.556 --> 48:47.120
<i>This is the Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

48:47.345 --> 48:50.994
<i>Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.</i>

48:53.507 --> 48:54.470
Mrs. Whitmore.

48:56.218 --> 48:58.392
<i>You must leave now.</i>

49:04.193 --> 49:06.116
First lady secured.
We're on the move.

49:16.414 --> 49:18.400
Look! They're opening up!

49:30.199 --> 49:32.291
It's so pretty.

49:59.570 --> 50:01.035
We gotta get the hell outta here!

50:14.843 --> 50:17.261
Go ahead, pilot.
We're ready to take off right now.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.963
Can you get a blanket for Patricia?

50:23.504 --> 50:24.383
Here.

50:27.328 --> 50:28.290
Over there?

50:40.530 --> 50:41.644
Time's up.

51:07.475 --> 51:08.228
Get down!

51:45.715 --> 51:47.808
Oh, crap.

53:24.999 --> 53:25.919
Oh, my God.

53:26.045 --> 53:27.217
Come on, Dylan.
We gotta go.

53:27.803 --> 53:29.100
Come on, Boomer.

54:09.516 --> 54:10.895
Boomer!

54:14.829 --> 54:15.707
Boomer!

54:43.238 --> 54:45.578
<i>Reports are unclear as to the extent
of the devastation,</i>

54:45.602 --> 54:47.983
<i>but from all accounts,
Los Angeles, Washington,</i>

54:48.007 --> 54:49.817
<i>and New York have been left in ruins...</i>

54:49.840 --> 54:51.268
Good God!

54:52.268 --> 54:53.608
I been saying it.

54:53.732 --> 54:55.967
I been saying it for 10 damn years.

54:55.990 --> 54:58.705
Ain't I been saying it, Miguel?
I been saying it.

55:00.503 --> 55:02.911
Dad, I'm sick. I don't feel good.

55:03.136 --> 55:04.280
Pull it over, man.

55:13.122 --> 55:15.945
We're going to be all right, Troy.
Leave me alone, man I got it.

55:21.128 --> 55:22.336
Miguel.

55:23.160 --> 55:24.862
Look at all that.

55:47.405 --> 55:50.197
We could have evacuated the cities hours ago.

55:53.540 --> 55:56.249
That's the advantage of being a fighter pilot.

55:57.274 --> 55:59.784
In the Gulf War, we knew what we had to do.

56:02.227 --> 56:03.297
It's just...

56:04.622 --> 56:06.469
not simple anymore.

56:08.370 --> 56:09.946
A lot of people died today.

56:15.415 --> 56:17.216
How many didn't have to?

56:20.626 --> 56:22.060
Any news on my wife yet?

56:23.719 --> 56:26.161
The helicopter never made it to Nellis.

56:28.596 --> 56:30.055
No radio contact.

56:38.423 --> 56:40.508
Come on, Dylan.
Stay close.

56:49.929 --> 56:51.304
Here it is.

57:16.104 --> 57:18.031
What happened, Mommy?

57:20.357 --> 57:21.657
I don't know, baby.

57:22.658 --> 57:25.017
You men will be the first wave
in our counterattack.

57:25.243 --> 57:27.132
Our target is to the north,

57:27.457 --> 57:30.843
centered above what remains
of down town Los Angeles.

57:32.845 --> 57:34.053
You scared, man?

57:34.579 --> 57:35.579
No.

57:37.172 --> 57:38.072
You?

57:38.172 --> 57:39.072
Nope.

57:41.674 --> 57:42.749
Hold me.

57:43.274 --> 57:44.742
Hey, pay attention.

57:45.142 --> 57:48.101
Something you want to add to this briefing,
Captain Hiller?

57:48.326 --> 57:51.769
No, sir. I'm just a little anxious to get up
there and whup E. T.'s ass, that's all.

57:53.903 --> 57:55.346
And you'll get your chance.

57:56.470 --> 57:57.780
You'll all get your chance.

57:58.880 --> 57:59.957
Good hunting.

58:00.356 --> 58:01.440
Dismissed.

58:01.940 --> 58:04.566
Let's kick the tires and light the fires,
big daddy.

58:07.800 --> 58:09.009
Let's bring it home.

58:09.535 --> 58:11.210
Let's bring that bad boy home, Captain.

58:11.635 --> 58:12.911
You loose?
Yes, sir.

58:13.636 --> 58:15.011
You got your victory dance?

58:15.137 --> 58:16.845
Well, I got it right here.

58:18.880 --> 58:21.915
Don't get premature on me, soldier.
We don't light up till the fat lady sings.

58:22.340 --> 58:23.782
I'm all ears, brother.

58:33.310 --> 58:34.477
You the man!

58:39.930 --> 58:41.256
All right, gentlemen, we're on.

58:41.480 --> 58:42.831
General, it's NORAD.

58:44.899 --> 58:46.138
General Grey here.

58:46.163 --> 58:47.179
Al?

58:47.182 --> 58:50.762
All satellite, microwave and ground
communications with the cities are down.

58:50.808 --> 58:51.871
All systems go.

58:51.895 --> 58:54.190
For intelligence, we believe
we're looking at a total loss.

58:54.689 --> 58:56.378
How about our boys?
Where are they?

58:57.177 --> 58:59.457
ETA to target, four minutes.

59:07.968 --> 59:09.498
<i>I shouldn't have left her.</i>

59:09.622 --> 59:11.441
<i>Don't worry about it, big man.</i>

59:11.565 --> 59:14.162
<i>I'm sure she got out of
here before it happened.</i>

59:14.863 --> 59:17.482
<i>Or, as the good reverend would say,</i>

59:18.594 --> 59:22.468
<i>Why we're on this particular
mission we'll never know.</i>

59:22.867 --> 59:26.511
<i>But I do know, here today,
that the Black Knights</i>

59:26.618 --> 59:29.302
<i>will emerge victorious once again.</i>

59:29.826 --> 59:30.913
<i>Amen, man.</i>

59:31.212 --> 59:32.387
<i>Amen, Reverend.</i>

59:45.925 --> 59:47.699
<i>Holy God.</i>

59:51.814 --> 59:52.875
<i>Lock and load.</i>

59:56.269 --> 59:57.137
Roger that.

59:57.160 --> 01:00:00.358
Los Angeles Attack Squadron has
Amraam missiles locked on target.

01:00:00.359 --> 01:00:02.321
Washington and New York
squadrons reporting lock on.

01:00:03.428 --> 01:00:04.561
Fire at will.

01:00:04.778 --> 01:00:06.178
Fire at will.
Fire at will.

01:00:07.725 --> 01:00:09.698
<i>Knights we are red and free.</i>

01:00:10.097 --> 01:00:11.511
<i>Knight 1, Fox 3.</i>

01:00:12.134 --> 01:00:13.578
<i>Knight 3, Fox 3.</i>

01:00:14.314 --> 01:00:15.790
<i>Knight 7, Fox 3.</i>

01:00:18.044 --> 01:00:19.244
Missiles have been fired.

01:00:40.573 --> 01:00:42.604
Are they not getting through?
No, sir. Not one.

01:00:42.729 --> 01:00:44.682
<i>Command, Knight 1.
Command, Knight 1.</i>

01:00:44.706 --> 01:00:46.483
<i>Switching to sidewinders.
Moving in.</i>

01:00:49.616 --> 01:00:52.788
<i>Knight 3, Love 50.
Notch reference 1-2-0.</i>

01:00:54.498 --> 01:00:56.342
<i>Knight 7.
1-2-0.</i>

01:00:56.768 --> 01:00:58.061
<i>Knight 1.
Sweet luck.</i>

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:00.374
<i>Echo, Fox 2.
Knight 7, Fox 2.</i>

01:01:04.683 --> 01:01:06.143
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

01:01:12.395 --> 01:01:14.414
<i>They must have some kind of
protective shield over their hull.</i>

01:01:14.438 --> 01:01:15.858
<i>Knights! Pull up! Pull up!</i>

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:22.380
<i>Knight 3, pull up!</i>

01:01:22.405 --> 01:01:24.405
<i>Controls are showing complete
failure of the stats.</i>

01:01:24.557 --> 01:01:25.594
<i>Pull up!</i>

01:01:34.999 --> 01:01:36.126
<i>Blow through!
Blow through!</i>

01:01:37.050 --> 01:01:38.304
<i>There's so many of them!</i>

01:01:41.544 --> 01:01:43.172
They got another one, sir.

01:01:45.752 --> 01:01:49.115
<i>Oh, no. You did not shoot
that green shit at me.</i>

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:53.400
<i>I've got you covered, big daddy.</i>

01:01:57.605 --> 01:01:59.174
<i>Damn. They got shields, too.</i>

01:02:10.126 --> 01:02:12.546
<i>Let's go, Knights.
Move, Knights, move!</i>

01:02:16.887 --> 01:02:18.516
<i>Jesus.</i>

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.569
They got another one, sir.
Two more just went down.

01:02:21.594 --> 01:02:23.190
They're dropping like flies.
We're losing them.

01:02:23.615 --> 01:02:24.961
All right. Get them out of there.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.939
All right. Squadron leaders,
retreat to fallback positions.

01:02:27.963 --> 01:02:29.900
Abort mission. Abort mission right away.
Do you read me?

01:02:29.925 --> 01:02:30.902
Do you copy?

01:02:34.466 --> 01:02:36.578
<i>We're going to have to make
a run for this one here.</i>

01:02:36.604 --> 01:02:37.813
<i>Let's get low.
Let's get fast.</i>

01:02:37.938 --> 01:02:39.942
<i>I got you, big daddy.
Let's get them.</i>

01:02:42.590 --> 01:02:43.607
<i>Watch the deck.</i>

01:02:51.530 --> 01:02:54.065
Do you read me, your postion?
Squadron Leader, do you read?

01:02:54.090 --> 01:02:55.428
Abort!
This isn't happening fast enough.

01:02:55.453 --> 01:02:56.754
Get them out of there!

01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:05.612
What's with the monitor?
Where's the picture?

01:03:05.937 --> 01:03:07.080
We've lost the satellite.

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:13.824
<i>We got two R-6, Jimmy. Check them.</i>

01:03:13.849 --> 01:03:14.918
<i>Roger.</i>

01:03:16.204 --> 01:03:18.598
<i>Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Move, move, move!</i>

01:03:19.217 --> 01:03:21.420
<i>He's on me like white on rice, big daddy.</i>

01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:22.997
<i>All right, Jimmy.
They ain't got nothing for us.</i>

01:03:22.998 --> 01:03:24.159
<i>Let's push it.
We gotta go! We gotta go!</i>

01:03:24.559 --> 01:03:26.196
<i>I can't shake them. I can't shake them.</i>

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.139
<i>Yes, you can. Just the way
I showed you. Let's go!</i>

01:03:28.540 --> 01:03:30.076
<i>Check me out.
Maybe I'm going to try something.</i>

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:31.520
<i>Don't do nothing stupid over there.</i>

01:03:31.545 --> 01:03:33.542
<i>You know me.
That's what I'm talking about.</i>

01:03:34.142 --> 01:03:36.429
<i>Jimmy! Jimmy, what are you doing?
You can't bank at that speed.</i>

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:38.820
<i>Jimmy, he's closing on you!</i>

01:03:41.813 --> 01:03:44.417
<i>Put your mask back on!
That's an order, Marine!</i>

01:03:44.418 --> 01:03:45.528
<i>I can't breathe!</i>

01:03:46.163 --> 01:03:47.257
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:03:48.793 --> 01:03:50.003
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:03:52.466 --> 01:03:53.877
<i>Jimmy! No!</i>

01:03:54.776 --> 01:03:56.354
That's affirmative.
We have incoming.

01:03:56.579 --> 01:03:58.017
Let me have it, son.
You got it.

01:03:59.342 --> 01:04:00.342
Friendly?

01:04:01.422 --> 01:04:02.322
Sergeant?

01:04:02.774 --> 01:04:04.069
I don't think so.

01:04:08.942 --> 01:04:10.570
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:04:31.898 --> 01:04:33.617
<i>Come on and get me!
Come and get me!</i>

01:04:38.599 --> 01:04:39.777
<i>What are you shooting at?</i>

01:04:40.970 --> 01:04:43.301
<i>Where you at, baby?
Come on! Come on!</i>

01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:50.179
<i>You can't hit nothing!</i>

01:05:08.575 --> 01:05:09.753
<i>Low bridge!</i>

01:05:13.877 --> 01:05:15.513
<i>See if you can fly that thing undercover.</i>

01:05:20.486 --> 01:05:22.125
<i>Hope you got an air bag.</i>

01:05:59.737 --> 01:06:00.857
Son of a bitch.

01:06:05.399 --> 01:06:06.885
That's right!
That's right!

01:06:07.410 --> 01:06:08.963
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

01:06:09.188 --> 01:06:10.642
That's what you get!

01:06:11.742 --> 01:06:12.542
Look at you!

01:06:12.619 --> 01:06:14.163
Ship all banged up!

01:06:14.330 --> 01:06:15.574
Who's the man?

01:06:16.574 --> 01:06:17.686
Who's the man?

01:06:17.786 --> 01:06:19.231
Wait until I get another plane!

01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:21.826
I'm lining all your friends up right beside you!

01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:24.098
Where you at?

01:06:24.798 --> 01:06:25.826
Where you at?

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.865
Welcome to Earth.

01:06:49.974 --> 01:06:52.354
Now, that's what I call a close encounter.

01:06:57.653 --> 01:06:59.698
Baby, stay right here.
Stay right here with Boomer.

01:07:09.132 --> 01:07:10.159
Keys.

01:07:10.385 --> 01:07:11.978
Come on. Keys.

01:07:12.346 --> 01:07:13.181
Yes!

01:07:13.848 --> 01:07:15.402
Come on, baby.
Come on.

01:07:16.132 --> 01:07:17.179
Come on.

01:07:18.719 --> 01:07:22.632
<i>Rumor reports indicate that this battle
has repeated itself all over the world</i>

01:07:22.656 --> 01:07:24.200
<i>with the exact same results.</i>

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.820
You're just like your mother, you know that?

01:07:27.645 --> 01:07:28.974
She was stubborn too.

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:32.300
I had to twist her arm
to get her to take her medicine.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:35.378
You're gonna be all right.

01:07:35.903 --> 01:07:37.374
You're gonna be fine.

01:07:40.004 --> 01:07:42.218
You see, Troy?
You're feeling better already.

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.772
I couldn't find anything.

01:07:45.897 --> 01:07:47.650
Everyone's packing up.
They're leaving.

01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.900
They said there's a spaceship
heading this way.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.300
We'd better leave too, then.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.050
Penicillin. At least, it'll help you
keep his fever down.

01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:57.538
Thank you.

01:07:58.263 --> 01:07:59.551
It's really nice of you to help us.

01:08:00.050 --> 01:08:02.100
I wish I could do more,
but we're moving out.

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:03.750
I'm going with you.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:11.650
Well, I just mean that we're going too.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.300
Cool.

01:08:13.324 --> 01:08:15.350
Tell that punk to shut the door.
We're out of here.

01:08:15.450 --> 01:08:17.300
He can sniff around somewhere else.

01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:19.000
Bye.
Bye.

01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:30.300
It's Air Force One, for crying out loud.
Still he gets sick.

01:08:31.850 --> 01:08:34.200
I don't feel so good.
Look at me? Like a rock.

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.649
Could be bad weather, could be
good weather. Doesn't matter.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.649
We could go up, we could go down.

01:08:38.674 --> 01:08:42.000
We could go back, we could go
forwards, we could go side to side...

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.300
What did I say?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.550
He still gets airsick?
Yeah.

01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:54.000
Julius, with all of this, I...

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.300
I didn't get a chance to thank you two.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.950
All he could think of was getting to you.

01:09:04.050 --> 01:09:06.149
There's still love there, I think.

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:10.550
Love was never a problem.

01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:12.649
All you need is love.

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:15.700
John Lennon. Smart man.

01:09:15.899 --> 01:09:17.649
Shot in the back, very sad.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:23.300
We've moved as many of our forces
away from our bases as possible.

01:09:23.323 --> 01:09:25.399
But we've already sustained heavy losses.

01:09:25.524 --> 01:09:27.500
I spoke with the joint chiefs
when they arrived at NORAD.

01:09:27.899 --> 01:09:31.700
They agree we must launch a counter
offensive with a full nuclear strike.

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:33.250
Over American soil?

01:09:33.450 --> 01:09:37.238
You're saying at this point we should
sacrifice more innocent American civilians?

01:09:37.238 --> 01:09:38.238
Is that right?

01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:41.200
Sir, if we don't strike soon, there may not
be much of an America left to defend!

01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:43.300
Sir! They've taken out NORAD!

01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:45.200
What?
It's gone, sir.

01:09:45.850 --> 01:09:46.950
My God!

01:09:47.700 --> 01:09:48.854
The vice president?

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:50.073
The joint chiefs?

01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:51.149
Mr. President.

01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.200
We must launch.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:58.000
A delay now would be more costly than
when you waited to evacuate the cities.

01:09:58.024 --> 01:10:00.600
No, no. You're not gonna
launch nuclear weapons!

01:10:00.624 --> 01:10:03.450
You're gonna kill them and us at
the same time. If we fire nukes...

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.000
then everybody else who's got them,
is gonna fire them. Sir, may I remind you

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.100
that you are a guest here?
You know what that means? Fallout!

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.200
You ever hear of nuclear winter?

01:10:07.300 --> 01:10:09.200
It's the end of life as we know it.
David, you can't interfere with the conversation.

01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:10.300
Do you hear what they're talking about?
I know, I know.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.300
Don't even think about it!
Just go.

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:12.300
I don't have to go.
You have to leave.

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.400
It can't be allowed!

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:16.500
Shut up! Captain, get him out!
Hey, hey, don't tell him to shut up!

01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:20.250
You'd all be dead now,
if it wasn't for my David!

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.350
None of you did anything to prevent this!

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:24.910
There was nothing we could do.

01:10:25.135 --> 01:10:27.174
We were totally unprepared for this.

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.500
Don't give me unprepared!
Come on, Julius.

01:10:29.524 --> 01:10:32.800
It was, what? In the 19, what? 50s.
Whatever, you had that spaceship.

01:10:33.650 --> 01:10:36.800
Dad, look, Dad...
Yeah, that thing that you found in New Mexico!

01:10:36.824 --> 01:10:38.100
Dad!
Where was that?

01:10:38.124 --> 01:10:39.148
No, not the spaceship.

01:10:39.172 --> 01:10:41.000
Roswell! Roswell, New Mexico.
Yeah! Don't do this.

01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:43.350
No, you had the spaceship
and you had the bodies!

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.500
They were locked up in a bunker.
Come on.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:46.900
Where was that?
David?

01:10:46.924 --> 01:10:48.500
I don't know.
Area 51! Right?

01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:49.688
Area 51!

01:10:49.913 --> 01:10:52.225
You knew then! And you did nothing.

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.400
Sir.

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.150
Regardless of what you may
have read in the tabloids,

01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.184
there have never been any spacecraft,

01:11:00.409 --> 01:11:02.074
recovered by our government.

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:04.900
Take my word for it. There's no Area 51.

01:11:05.150 --> 01:11:07.200
And there's no recovered spaceship.

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:09.150
Excuse me, Mr. President.

01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:14.200
That's not entirely accurate.

01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.750
What? Which part?

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:29.100
Hold on, everybody! Hold on!

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:31.850
Sorry.

01:11:50.550 --> 01:11:52.100
The end hath come!

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:55.800
He spaketh His word,
and the end hath come!

01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:56.988
Hop on!

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:58.725
We're heading out to El Toro!

01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:01.950
You cannot defy what hath come!

01:12:03.250 --> 01:12:04.400
It is the end!

01:12:10.950 --> 01:12:12.150
El Toro?

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.950
Can you give me a hand?
Yeah, sure.

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:30.800
Oh, God!

01:12:38.050 --> 01:12:38.831
Okay, okay,

01:12:39.156 --> 01:12:40.374
Let's get this off.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:41.550
Here, let me help you.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.100
She's hurt pretty badly.

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.450
You know, this was supposed to be
my weekend off.

01:12:56.200 --> 01:12:57.450
But, no!

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.836
You got me out here,
dragging your heavy ass,

01:13:01.260 --> 01:13:02.724
through the burning desert,

01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.000
with your dreadlocks sticking
out the back of my parachute.

01:13:06.450 --> 01:13:08.850
You gotta come down here with an attitude,

01:13:09.050 --> 01:13:10.900
acting all big and bad.

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:14.900
And what the hell is that smell?

01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:21.650
I could've been at a barbecue!

01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:24.650
But I ain't mad.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.197
It's all right.

01:13:26.622 --> 01:13:28.024
It's all right.

01:13:43.450 --> 01:13:44.450
Hey!

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:47.050
Hey! Hey!

01:13:52.900 --> 01:13:54.000
Hey!

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.200
Do you need a lift, soldier?

01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:12.400
When I flew overhead,
I saw a base not too far from here.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.800
It ain't on the map.

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:19.150
Trust me, it's there.

01:14:35.450 --> 01:14:36.600
Ten hut!

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.974
Mr. President.
General.

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:44.341
Welcome to Area 51.

01:14:44.466 --> 01:14:45.824
Please follow me.

01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:49.850
We're now 24 floors beneath the surface,

01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:52.950
and, here's our main research facility.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:54.250
Let's see it.

01:14:54.350 --> 01:14:57.250
I'm sorry, sir, it's a clean room.
It's to keep it static free.

01:14:57.274 --> 01:14:59.400
If we'd all get to decontamination...
Open the door.

01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:02.350
Yes, sir.

01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:25.750
My God!

01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:28.000
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?

01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:31.350
Two words, Mr. President.
Plausible deniability.

01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:41.700
I don't understand.
Where does all this come from?

01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:43.700
How do you get funding
for something like this?

01:15:44.650 --> 01:15:47.300
You don't actually think
they spend $20,000 on a hammer,

01:15:47.324 --> 01:15:49.550
$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?

01:15:51.900 --> 01:15:54.100
Mr. President, this is Dr. Okun.

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:58.350
He's been heading up the research department
on this project for the last 15 years.

01:16:00.150 --> 01:16:01.600
How do you do?

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.800
Mr. President!

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:08.050
This...

01:16:08.050 --> 01:16:09.400
What a pleasure!

01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:11.950
As you can imagine, they...

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.200
They don't let us out much.

01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.450
I can understand that.

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:20.700
Well...

01:16:21.150 --> 01:16:23.150
I guess you'd like to see the big tamale?

01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.050
Follow me.

01:17:16.950 --> 01:17:18.400
She's a beaut, ain't she?

01:17:21.550 --> 01:17:23.000
As you can see from the repairs,

01:17:23.024 --> 01:17:26.600
we've been trying to put her back
together since the late 1960s.

01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:29.950
Don't tell me you've had this for 40 years
and you don't know anything about them.

01:17:30.100 --> 01:17:31.900
Oh, hell, no! No, no, no, no, no!

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.700
We know tons about them.

01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:35.950
But the neatest stuff...

01:17:36.650 --> 01:17:39.250
The neatest stuff has only happened
in the last few days.

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:43.900
See, we can't duplicate their type of power,
so we've never been able to experiment.

01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:49.150
But since these guys started showing up,
all the little gizmos inside turned on.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:53.150
The last 24 hours have been really exciting!

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.900
Exciting? People are dying out there.

01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.500
I don't think exciting is the word
I'd choose to describe it!

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.300
You guys are hoping to fly this thing?

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:04.700
You said you can repair their technology.

01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:06.900
Can you tell us anything useful about them?

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:09.400
Oh, yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, I mean...

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:12.100
They're not all that dissimilar from us.

01:18:12.200 --> 01:18:16.300
Breathes oxygen,
comparable tolerances to heat, cold.

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:18.850
Probably why they're interested in our planet.

01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:21.350
Hey!

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:22.950
Hey!

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:26.500
You guys wanna see them?

01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:37.850
This is...

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:39.950
This is the vault.

01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:43.000
Or, as some of us have come to call it...

01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:45.500
the freak show.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:09.750
When we found them,

01:19:10.300 --> 01:19:12.070
they were wearing some sort,

01:19:12.295 --> 01:19:13.874
of biomechanical suits.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.500
Once we got them off, we learned
a great deal about their anatomy.

01:19:18.250 --> 01:19:19.850
Eyes, ears,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.600
no vocal cords.

01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:25.150
We are assuming they communicate
with each other through some other means.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:28.800
You're obviously not thinking about
hand signals and body language.

01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:32.700
It's some kind of extrasensory
perception, telepathy.

01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:35.300
So...

01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.700
It's an organic life form.

01:19:42.900 --> 01:19:44.300
Can they be killed?

01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:46.600
Their bodies are just as frail as ours.

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:48.650
And these two died in the crash.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.850
This one a few weeks later.

01:19:51.100 --> 01:19:52.000
You just...

01:19:52.425 --> 01:19:55.224
You have to get through their
technology, which is...

01:19:55.650 --> 01:19:58.300
I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.

01:19:59.950 --> 01:20:00.775
David,

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:03.474
you unlocked part of their technology.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.900
You cracked the code.

01:20:04.924 --> 01:20:06.700
Oh, no, no.
All I did was stumble onto their...

01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.760
signal. I don't know how...

01:20:09.985 --> 01:20:11.224
helpful I can be.

01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:14.350
Why don't you show him
what you've discovered so far?

01:20:15.850 --> 01:20:17.850
Figure out what they haven't thought of yet.

01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:22.450
We'll see if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.

01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:34.800
What code?

01:20:55.300 --> 01:20:57.700
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.567
I'm sorry, captain.
This is a restricted area.

01:20:59.792 --> 01:21:01.324
I can't let you pass without clearance.

01:21:02.148 --> 01:21:02.948
Okay.

01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:04.450
Come here.

01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:06.100
You wanna see my clearance?

01:21:09.550 --> 01:21:11.218
Maybe I'll just leave this here with you.

01:21:12.343 --> 01:21:13.324
Let them pass.

01:21:13.450 --> 01:21:15.100
Let them pass!
Get the hell out of the way!

01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:19.200
Did you see that?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.600
Come on down.
Look!

01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:23.800
Watch your step.
Alright.

01:21:25.050 --> 01:21:28.600
Well, obviously this cockpit
was designed to seat three.

01:21:28.850 --> 01:21:31.500
Though how they sat on them,
I don't know.

01:21:32.150 --> 01:21:32.850
Gently.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.650
You see these gizmos flashing?
Yeah.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.050
We've been working around the clock
trying to get a fix on all this crap.

01:21:39.500 --> 01:21:41.400
Some stuff we figured out right away.

01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:45.750
This we're pretty sure is the life
support system for the cabin.

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.000
And this doohickey is connected to...

01:21:50.600 --> 01:21:54.700
Well, it was connected to the engine.
Here, take that, will you?

01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:58.250
These configurations...

01:22:01.450 --> 01:22:05.200
Well, to be honest, we don't know
what the hell this crap is.

01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:11.550
But this is clearly what they use
to guide and navigate their craft.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:13.400
Neat?

01:22:13.850 --> 01:22:18.900
Could somebody grab my laptop there?
Doc can I just have the computer inside?

01:22:18.950 --> 01:22:20.400
What?
See these patterns here?

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.750
They are repeating sequentially,
just like their countdown signal.

01:22:23.300 --> 01:22:26.000
They're using that frequency
for computer communications.

01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.850
See?
That's how they're coordinating their ships.

01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:31.350
You know...

01:22:32.150 --> 01:22:33.800
You're really starting to make us look bad.

01:22:42.250 --> 01:22:44.700
They got one! They got one alive!

01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:47.050
They got one, alive!
Jesus!

01:22:47.100 --> 01:22:49.400
Look. You'll be okay by yourself, Dave?

01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000
Fine by it.
Yeah.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:53.000
Don't touch anything.

01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:57.400
Everybody's always telling me
not to touch anything.

01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:00.300
Here, here.

01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:03.300
It's all wet.

01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:15.500
Right here.
We got him in the back of the pickup.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.200
General, sir. Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.750
Guess who's coming to dinner!

01:23:26.550 --> 01:23:27.871
I need a doctor.

01:23:28.396 --> 01:23:29.824
I need a doctor!

01:23:32.650 --> 01:23:35.800
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
How long has he been unconscious?

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.600
About three hours.
Let's get him in containment, stat!

01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:41.100
My son, he's very sick.
He needs immediate attention!

01:23:41.250 --> 01:23:44.100
He's drying out.
I want him sprayed down with saline.

01:23:44.250 --> 01:23:46.075
He has a problem with his adrenal cortex.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:47.374
Please!

01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:53.150
If you don't do something about it
right now, my son will die!

01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:55.247
Okay, just help him!

01:23:55.272 --> 01:23:57.574
Okay. O'Haver, Miller, you come with us.

01:23:57.700 --> 01:23:59.458
You, take us to him, okay?

01:23:59.783 --> 01:24:00.574
Let's go.

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:04.600
All right! Move it, move it, move it!

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.450
As the former head of the CIA,
you knew about this place.

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.800
When were you planning
on informing the rest of us?

01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:13.800
It had been deemed classified.

01:24:13.824 --> 01:24:16.300
You should have told us about
this when they first arrived!

01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:19.650
You should have warned us
before we launched a counterattack,

01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:22.400
that cost the lives of hundreds
of American pilots!

01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:23.800
There was no way that we could have known

01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:26.000
that our fighters would have been
that ineffective against their attackers.

01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:27.900
Mr. President.

01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:31.000
The little bit of information we have comes
directly into this room, Mr. President.

01:24:31.950 --> 01:24:34.300
Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia.

01:24:35.350 --> 01:24:36.600
Destroyed.

01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:41.450
We learned that NATO and Western Allied
installations were the first to be taken out.

01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:43.050
Then we were hit.

01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:46.250
They knew exactly where and how to hit us.

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.700
And our forces?
We're down to 15%.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:53.400
If you calculate the time it takes
to destroy a city and move on,

01:24:53.850 --> 01:24:58.050
we're looking at the worldwide
destruction of every major city...

01:24:58.950 --> 01:25:01.600
in the next 36 hours.

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.600
We're being exterminated.

01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.300
Mr. President.

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:12.650
This is Captain Steven Hiller.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:14.800
Captain.
Mr. President.

01:25:14.950 --> 01:25:16.000
Well done!

01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:17.600
Where is it now?

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:19.800
We have it isolated down
in the containment lab, sir.

01:25:21.300 --> 01:25:22.750
I'd like to go see it.

01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:31.450
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:35.900
Hasn't anyone told you?

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.950
El Toro has been completely destroyed.

01:26:34.450 --> 01:26:36.350
We were lucky.
Yeah!

01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.200
Today was the first time I used the subway.

01:26:39.850 --> 01:26:41.800
Thank God for the Metro Rail.

01:26:42.150 --> 01:26:43.750
These should last us a while.

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:46.550
Don't move. I'll get it for you.
Stay still.

01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:50.050
He's your son?

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.450
He's my angel.

01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:55.350
Was his father stationed here?

01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:57.400
No, he...

01:26:58.250 --> 01:26:59.800
He wasn't his father.

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.200
But I was kind of hoping
he wanted the job, though.

01:27:08.650 --> 01:27:10.439
So what do you do for a living?

01:27:10.764 --> 01:27:11.774
I'm a dancer.

01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:14.350
Ballet!

01:27:14.800 --> 01:27:15.550
No.

01:27:16.675 --> 01:27:17.774
Exotic.

01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:21.950
Sorry.

01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:23.550
Don't be.

01:27:24.175 --> 01:27:25.224
I'm not.

01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:27.100
It's good money. Besides...

01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:29.200
My baby's worth it.

01:27:29.350 --> 01:27:30.950
Dylan, come here.

01:27:31.650 --> 01:27:33.750
I want you to meet the First Lady.

01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:38.950
Hello.
Hi.

01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:42.850
I didn't know that you'd recognized me.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.050
Well, I didn't want to say nothing.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.300
I voted for the other guy.

01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:51.981
All right, life-support monitors recording.

01:27:52.206 --> 01:27:54.024
So if we screw up, it's all on tape.

01:27:54.048 --> 01:27:55.850
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

01:27:55.874 --> 01:27:57.650
Let's get this biomechanical suit off.

01:27:57.850 --> 01:28:00.400
Put the spreader right here,
right along the ridge.

01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:04.500
Microprobe thingamajig goes right here.
Pick there. Good.

01:28:05.200 --> 01:28:07.800
All right, now spread it very, very gently.

01:28:07.950 --> 01:28:09.000
Let me get in.

01:28:16.050 --> 01:28:18.100
Gentle, gentle, that's it.

01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:21.300
Run this right in...

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:28.750
All right. Okay.

01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:30.500
Let's proceed.

01:28:31.050 --> 01:28:34.500
Now comes the... the really icky part.

01:28:36.300 --> 01:28:38.200
Oh, boy!

01:28:38.350 --> 01:28:41.900
This is one smelly, disgusting...

01:28:50.350 --> 01:28:51.450
Oh, look at it!

01:28:51.650 --> 01:28:54.100
It doesn't look alive, does it?

01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:00.100
The arm is moving.

01:29:09.850 --> 01:29:11.950
Doctor? Doctor?

01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:16.450
Doctor?

01:29:18.450 --> 01:29:20.100
Don't move! Don't move!

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:06.800
Dr. Okun?

01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:33.050
<i>Release me.</i>

01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:35.400
Open the door. Get him out of there!
No, wait.

01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:52.550
<i>Release me</i>

01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:54.600
<i>now.</i>

01:30:56.400 --> 01:30:59.150
<i>Now!</i>

01:31:05.250 --> 01:31:07.850
<i>I know there is much
we can learn from each other,</i>

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.500
<i>if we can negotiate a truce.</i>

01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:13.700
<i>We can find a way to coexist.</i>

01:31:15.550 --> 01:31:18.100
<i>Can there be a peace between us?</i>

01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:21.100
<i>Peace?</i>

01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:24.600
<i>No peace.</i>

01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:32.450
<i>What is it you want us to do?</i>

01:31:34.950 --> 01:31:36.850
<i>Die.</i>

01:31:46.100 --> 01:31:48.300
<i>Die!</i>

01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:54.000
Mr. President.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.000
Is that glass bulletproof?
No, sir.

01:32:17.800 --> 01:32:19.950
Are you all right?
I saw...

01:32:20.150 --> 01:32:21.700
his thoughts.

01:32:22.650 --> 01:32:24.700
I saw what they're planning to do.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.200
They're like locusts.

01:32:29.550 --> 01:32:31.550
They're moving from planet to planet.

01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:33.400
Their whole civilization.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:37.250
After they've consumed every
natural resource, they move on.

01:32:39.650 --> 01:32:41.300
And we're next.

01:32:53.000 --> 01:32:54.700
Nuke them.

01:32:55.900 --> 01:32:57.700
Let's nuke the bastards.

01:33:09.300 --> 01:33:11.350
Just my luck. No ice.

01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:14.100
I take it you've heard?

01:33:15.450 --> 01:33:17.050
Hey, toast.

01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:19.200
To the end of the world.

01:33:19.350 --> 01:33:21.750
He didn't come to this decision lightly.

01:33:21.900 --> 01:33:24.000
He didn't have any other choice.

01:33:25.050 --> 01:33:27.050
Well, you still believe in him.

01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:29.150
Yeah.
Well, he's a good man.

01:33:31.050 --> 01:33:33.550
He'd better be. You left me for him.

01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:36.250
Or, you know, for your career.

01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:39.300
You know, it wasn't just my career.

01:33:39.450 --> 01:33:41.900
It was the biggest opportunity of my life.

01:33:42.050 --> 01:33:46.200
I wanted my life to make a difference.
I wanted my life to mean something.

01:33:46.250 --> 01:33:47.550
Yeah. And...

01:33:47.975 --> 01:33:49.274
I wasn't...

01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:51.700
ambitious enough for you?
David!

01:33:51.850 --> 01:33:53.900
David, you could have done
anything that you wanted.

01:33:54.100 --> 01:33:57.700
Research, development...
Oh, honey, I was happy where I was.

01:33:57.850 --> 01:34:00.600
Haven't you ever wanted to be
part of something special?

01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:06.600
I was part of something special.

01:34:21.850 --> 01:34:23.900
Well, if it makes any difference,

01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.100
I never stopped loving you.

01:34:27.450 --> 01:34:29.500
But that wasn't enough, was it?

01:34:48.050 --> 01:34:50.100
Let's pick it up, man. We've got
a tight schedule. Now, let's go!

01:34:57.550 --> 01:34:59.750
Let's pick it up, man.
We're on a tight schedule. Let's go!

01:34:59.774 --> 01:35:00.850
Let's go man!

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:03.000
Pick it up!

01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:08.750
What the hell are you doing?
Get out of there!

01:35:10.050 --> 01:35:12.650
Look, I got something I gotta handle.
I'm just borrowing it.

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.000
No, you're not, sir.

01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:16.150
Do you really wanna shoot me?

01:35:18.750 --> 01:35:20.500
Just tell them I hit you.

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:28.600
Command, this is Retal Op.

01:35:28.624 --> 01:35:29.683
Squadron is in the air.

01:35:29.707 --> 01:35:30.620
We are on station

01:35:30.645 --> 01:35:31.948
<i>and awaiting instructions.</i>

01:35:31.972 --> 01:35:34.400
Roger. Break formation.
Head to targets.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.400
Sir...

01:35:41.050 --> 01:35:42.450
They're breaking formation.

01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:47.300
Mr. President, we're initiating sequence code.
Verification. Alpha. Zulu. Six. Eight. Niner.

01:35:47.650 --> 01:35:49.300
Which city will be reached first?

01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:50.631
Houston, Texas.

01:35:50.656 --> 01:35:52.774
ETA, six minutes and counting down.

01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:53.513
Houston.

01:35:53.638 --> 01:35:55.775
The major cities have been deserted.

01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:59.750
Civilian casualties should
be down to a minimum.

01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:05.250
Command, this is Neighborhood Watch.

01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:06.900
We are in position.

01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:09.550
Tracking monitors are locked on.

01:36:09.700 --> 01:36:12.100
We are going to visual recon.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.200
<i>Roger that, NW.</i>

01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:19.437
We have confirmation.

01:36:19.562 --> 01:36:20.974
Launch code confirmed.

01:36:21.150 --> 01:36:23.650
Alpha. Zulu. Six. Eight. Niner. Standing by.

01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:28.100
Laser targeting.

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.000
Locked on.

01:36:31.650 --> 01:36:32.980
We're locked on, sir.

01:36:33.105 --> 01:36:34.624
Do you wish to deploy?

01:36:38.550 --> 01:36:41.800
Mr. President, if you wish to deploy,
the time is now.

01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.300
Mr. President?
Deploy.

01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:53.300
That's a go. Alpha. Zulu. Six. Eight. Niner.
That's correct. Deploy.

01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:54.900
Here we go.

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:04.600
Bird's away.

01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:06.500
We have visual confirmation of the missile.

01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:08.300
It's on target.

01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:09.750
<i>Approaching.</i>

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.800
May our children forgive us.

01:37:12.824 --> 01:37:16.250
<i>Five seconds to impact.
Three, two...</i>

01:37:16.450 --> 01:37:17.550
one.

01:37:19.700 --> 01:37:21.550
Oh, yeah! It's a hit!

01:37:26.250 --> 01:37:28.450
Get down! Get down!

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.300
Can we confirm that
the target was destroyed?

01:37:31.450 --> 01:37:34.300
Get the tank commander on line. I want
confirmation that the target was destroyed.

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.400
Yes, sir!

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.900
Red Arrow, Alpha 9723. Can you read?

01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:40.500
Repeat, Commander.
You're breaking up.

01:37:40.925 --> 01:37:41.974
<i>We have lost visual.</i>

01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:43.700
Roger that.
We're looking for confirmation.

01:37:51.650 --> 01:37:53.200
We got the bastards.
Yeah!

01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:55.550
Good job, everyone! Congratulations!

01:37:58.100 --> 01:38:01.800
Commander, do you have visual?
I repeat, we need visual confirmation.

01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:03.600
Has the target been destroyed?

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.100
Negative.

01:38:22.100 --> 01:38:23.400
<i>Target remains.</i>

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.950
<i>I repeat, target remains.</i>

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.300
Call the other planes back.

01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:39.300
Other bombers might have more luck.
We shouldn't just give up on this!

01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.200
I said call them back!

01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:46.600
Abort.
Abort mission.

01:38:46.624 --> 01:38:48.068
Issue the abort codes right away.

01:38:48.092 --> 01:38:50.224
This is an abort, full abort.
Do you read?

01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:52.100
Abort mission right away.

01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:31.100
Jasmine!

01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:45.450
You're late!

01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:48.050
You know I like to make an entrance.

01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:59.750
Where are we going?
Through there, sir.

01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:03.650
Mr. President, your wife is resting
comfortably for the moment.

01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:07.100
Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier...
Hey, there she is! Go on!

01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:13.500
She doesn't look too good.
Your wife is bleeding internally, Mr. President.

01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:17.650
Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier...
Wait a minute. What are you saying?

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.700
We can't stop the bleeding.

01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:22.650
If we'd...

01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:25.700
There's nothing we can do for her.

01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:30.400
We were worried.
We didn't know where you were.

01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:37.750
You've gotten bigger, I think.

01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:39.050
I did?

01:40:42.150 --> 01:40:44.300
You just keep growing and growing.

01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:47.800
I can't...

01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:50.900
Hey.

01:40:51.500 --> 01:40:55.900
Can you wait outside for a little bit,
so mom can get a rest?

01:40:56.050 --> 01:40:57.550
Hey, come on, Munchkin.

01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:10.850
I'm so sorry that I didn't come home
when you asked me to.

01:41:13.850 --> 01:41:15.050
It's okay.

01:41:17.150 --> 01:41:18.700
The doctors...

01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:21.850
think that you're...

01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:24.350
gonna be just fine.

01:41:27.150 --> 01:41:28.250
Liar.

01:42:25.150 --> 01:42:27.300
Is Mommy sleeping now?

01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:30.350
Yeah.

01:42:32.150 --> 01:42:33.750
Mommy's sleeping.

01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.600
Hey.

01:43:10.100 --> 01:43:11.150
David!

01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:13.079
What the hell are you doing?

01:43:13.204 --> 01:43:14.474
I'm making a mess!

01:43:14.900 --> 01:43:16.450
Yeah. This I can see.

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:19.250
We gotta burn the rainforest
with toxic waste,

01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:21.650
pollute the air and rip up the ozone layer!

01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:23.850
Because maybe if we screw
this planet up enough.

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:27.000
They won't want it anymore.

01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:29.150
Wait, wait, wait. David, David!

01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:30.465
Don't do this to yourself.

01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:31.524
Listen to me.

01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:32.900
Are you listening to me?
I'm listening.

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:35.850
Everyone loses faith
at some point in their life.

01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:37.700
David! Even myself.

01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.950
I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.650
You see, sometimes...

01:43:50.100 --> 01:43:52.250
we have to remember what we still have.

01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:54.700
Like what?

01:43:58.050 --> 01:43:59.038
Well...

01:43:59.663 --> 01:44:01.125
you still have your health.

01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:05.300
David, David, you need your rest.
Come on!

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:08.450
Get off this freezing concrete floor
before you catch a cold. Come on.

01:44:11.950 --> 01:44:13.074
What did you just say?

01:44:13.299 --> 01:44:14.474
You mean about faith?

01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:17.150
Well, you see, a man can live his life...
No, no, no.

01:44:17.174 --> 01:44:18.350
No, the other part.

01:44:18.650 --> 01:44:19.669
What? What?

01:44:20.394 --> 01:44:21.674
I don't want you to catch cold.

01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:28.750
What is that?
What's the matter with you?

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:30.600
Genius.

01:44:31.816 --> 01:44:32.816
Genius?

01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:35.200
My dad. A total genius.

01:44:37.350 --> 01:44:38.090
Jerry?

01:44:38.315 --> 01:44:39.324
Wake up.

01:44:39.350 --> 01:44:41.450
We got work to do.
Get everybody down here right away.

01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:48.000
Look at that!

01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:51.700
Does that thing really fly in outer space?

01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:53.549
It most certainly does.

01:44:53.674 --> 01:44:55.300
Sure doesn't look like it.

01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:56.641
Hey, they're here.

01:44:56.666 --> 01:44:58.474
All right, Connie, what's this all about?

01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:00.000
I have no idea.

01:45:00.150 --> 01:45:01.350
Get everybody off.

01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:03.900
Right, everybody. Clear the platform.
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:06.300
Major Mitchell...

01:45:06.500 --> 01:45:08.000
Do you have a pistol?
What?

01:45:08.450 --> 01:45:10.350
Have you got a gun?
Sergeant, your sidearm.

01:45:13.000 --> 01:45:16.300
See that Coke can on top of the alien craft?

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.000
Think you can shoot that thing off?

01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:19.650
Do it. Shoot it.

01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:20.953
Sir?

01:45:22.578 --> 01:45:23.624
Go ahead.

01:45:29.900 --> 01:45:31.100
What the hell are you doing?

01:45:31.150 --> 01:45:32.483
I'm sorry. My fault.

01:45:32.908 --> 01:45:33.699
My. My fault.

01:45:33.700 --> 01:45:36.750
See, that Coke can
was protected by the craft's shield.

01:45:36.774 --> 01:45:38.006
We can't penetrate their defenses.

01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:39.474
We know that already.
What's your point?

01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:41.939
Right. My point is,
if we can't beat their defenses,

01:45:42.264 --> 01:45:43.800
then we gotta get around them.

01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:46.259
Major, one more time...

01:45:46.684 --> 01:45:47.774
Any time.

01:45:58.800 --> 01:45:59.938
How did you do that?

01:46:00.663 --> 01:46:01.924
I gave it a cold.

01:46:03.250 --> 01:46:04.375
I gave it a virus.

01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:06.724
A computer virus.

01:46:07.350 --> 01:46:09.650
Are you telling us you can send out a signal

01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:11.800
that will disable all their shields?

01:46:11.824 --> 01:46:14.100
That's right. Just like they
used our satellites against us.

01:46:14.524 --> 01:46:17.250
We can use their own signal, against them.

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:20.900
If we plant a virus, into that mother ship,

01:46:20.924 --> 01:46:23.650
it's gonna then filter down into
all the corresponding ships below.

01:46:24.250 --> 01:46:26.050
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

01:46:26.074 --> 01:46:30.500
Just how exactly do we infect the
mother ship with this virus?

01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.500
We're... We're gonna...

01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:35.538
have to...

01:46:36.263 --> 01:46:39.075
fly their alien craft out of our
atmosphere and dock with it.

01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:42.400
We can enter here,
as shown in these satellite photos.

01:46:42.424 --> 01:46:43.800
We then upload the virus.

01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:47.800
We then set off some kind of explosion,
which will disable it.

01:46:47.900 --> 01:46:49.900
And that'll disorient the smaller ships below.

01:46:49.924 --> 01:46:52.850
And that could buy you,
I think at least, some time to...

01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:55.472
to take them...

01:46:55.797 --> 01:46:57.474
take them out, take them down.

01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:58.600
Do your...

01:46:59.565 --> 01:47:00.724
Do your stuff.

01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:02.244
This is ridiculous!

01:47:02.469 --> 01:47:04.224
How long would their shields be down?

01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:08.400
I don't know. A matter of minutes.

01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:11.000
You want us to coordinate
a massive worldwide counterstrike

01:47:11.024 --> 01:47:13.600
with a window of only a few minutes?

01:47:13.650 --> 01:47:15.775
With shields down,
that might be possible.

01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:17.174
Please!

01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:21.200
We don't have the manpower or the resources
to launch that kind of a campaign!

01:47:21.750 --> 01:47:23.900
Not to mention that this whole
cockamamie plan

01:47:23.900 --> 01:47:27.700
is dependent on a machine that no one
in this world is qualified to operate.

01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:30.400
I wouldn't say that, sir.

01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:32.038
I've seen these things in action.

01:47:32.063 --> 01:47:34.325
And I'm well aware of their
maneuvering capabilities.

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:38.700
With your permission, general,
I'd like the opportunity to try.

01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:41.650
That thing is a wreck!

01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:44.200
It crash-landed back in the '50s!

01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:46.400
We don't even know if it's capable of flying!

01:47:46.650 --> 01:47:47.250
Jim...

01:47:47.975 --> 01:47:49.174
remove the clamps.

01:48:11.550 --> 01:48:12.850
Any questions?

01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:19.100
Let's do it.

01:48:23.150 --> 01:48:25.000
All right, you heard the president,
let's get this thing preped and ready to fly!

01:48:25.100 --> 01:48:26.850
Good luck, pilot.
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:29.800
A virus!

01:48:31.150 --> 01:48:32.200
Your idea.

01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:34.350
That's right.

01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:42.800
Do you really think you can fly that thing?

01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:46.600
Do you really think you can do
all that bullshit you just said?

01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.800
I understand you are upset
over the death of your wife.

01:48:58.950 --> 01:49:01.700
But that's no excuse for making
another fatal mistake.

01:49:01.724 --> 01:49:03.900
No! The only mistake I ever made

01:49:03.924 --> 01:49:06.800
was to appoint a sniveling little weasel
like you as Secretary of Defense.

01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:08.500
I don't think you understand!
However!

01:49:09.550 --> 01:49:13.150
That is one mistake I am thankful
to say that I don't have to live with.

01:49:13.500 --> 01:49:15.100
Mr. President, please!
Mr. Nimziki...

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.100
You're fired.

01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:24.600
Let's organize every plane we can find
and get us some goddamn pilots to fly them.

01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:26.200
Yes, sir.

01:49:26.550 --> 01:49:28.425
He can't do that.
Well, he just...

01:49:29.650 --> 01:49:30.650
did.

01:49:34.500 --> 01:49:37.200
Command has attempted to compile
a list of casualties and losses,

01:49:37.224 --> 01:49:38.900
but information is sketchy at best.

01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.300
Well, we know we've lost
the Belgian contingent in the Sina.

01:49:41.850 --> 01:49:45.900
There's a strong possibility ther may be more
reinforcements hiding in the Golan Straits.

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:50.400
What the hell's he saying?

01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:53.000
It seems they're getting a signal.
Old Morse code.

01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:07.200
It's from the Americans!

01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:11.850
They want to organize a counter offensive!

01:50:11.900 --> 01:50:13.308
It's about bloody time!

01:50:13.433 --> 01:50:14.824
What do they plan to do?

01:50:37.250 --> 01:50:40.500
We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions

01:50:40.650 --> 01:50:42.500
in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

01:50:42.500 --> 01:50:43.446
That's impressive.

01:50:43.770 --> 01:50:45.524
Considering it's all being done with...

01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:47.250
Morse code.

01:50:47.700 --> 01:50:48.800
The armed forces here?

01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:51.250
We have sufficient aircraft
for the battleplan, but...

01:50:51.550 --> 01:50:52.550
But what?

01:50:52.675 --> 01:50:54.674
Pilots are coming up short.

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:56.550
Well, then, find them.

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:59.100
<i>Ham radio operators
from New York to Japan</i>

01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.700
<i>trade rumors of military forces in hiding</i>

01:51:02.050 --> 01:51:05.200
<i>unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation.</i>

01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:09.200
<i>What we're planning at this time
is to launch a counter offensive.</i>

01:51:09.650 --> 01:51:11.200
<i>However, with our depleted manpower,</i>

01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:14.000
<i>we're asking that anyone with any
flight experience come forward.</i>

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:18.000
<i>Military training is preferable, but anyone
who can fly a plane would be useful.</i>

01:51:20.550 --> 01:51:21.637
I can fly.

01:51:22.262 --> 01:51:23.474
I'm a pilot.

01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:26.825
All right, guys, listen up!

01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:28.424
All right, pay close attention.

01:51:28.448 --> 01:51:31.400
These F-18s are very different
than the jets you piloted before.

01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:33.650
It's kind of strong.
You have to forgive the expression,

01:51:33.674 --> 01:51:36.550
but you're about to get a crash
course in modern avionics.

01:51:37.500 --> 01:51:39.600
Keep it coming. Keep it, keep it.
Okay, you got it!

01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:40.296
All right, listen up.

01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:41.899
Before we can begin,
we're gonna have to get a little

01:51:41.900 --> 01:51:44.200
background information
on your flight experience.

01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:46.600
Let's start with you.

01:51:47.550 --> 01:51:48.550
Who, me?

01:51:50.650 --> 01:51:52.850
Well, I'm Russell Casse, sir.

01:51:54.350 --> 01:51:58.300
And, after 'Nam, I got into crop-dusting.

01:51:59.100 --> 01:51:59.800
And...

01:52:00.625 --> 01:52:01.924
been doing that ever since.

01:52:02.250 --> 01:52:06.400
On a personal note, sir,
I'd just like to add that...

01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:11.200
ever since I was kidnapped
by aliens 10 years ago,

01:52:11.250 --> 01:52:13.150
I have been dying for some payback.

01:52:13.174 --> 01:52:15.521
And I just want you to know that...

01:52:16.046 --> 01:52:17.324
I won't let you down.

01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:21.250
You have one tactical nuclear missile

01:52:21.350 --> 01:52:24.600
we're loading into this launcher
we're installing under the right wing.

01:52:24.750 --> 01:52:26.700
This is the firing mechanism.

01:52:26.850 --> 01:52:29.300
It'll be attached to the ship's main console.

01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:31.700
Just like the Amraam launch pad on a Stealth.

01:52:31.850 --> 01:52:34.150
Except the nuke will not detonate at impact.

01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:38.600
You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses out of there.

01:52:39.450 --> 01:52:40.850
Good luck, gentlemen.

01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:43.400
30 seconds.

01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:44.600
Tell me, tell me.

01:52:44.700 --> 01:52:46.100
Well, it's the strongest radio transmitter
we could get.

01:52:46.200 --> 01:52:47.800
It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.

01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:48.713
30 seconds.

01:52:48.838 --> 01:52:50.975
Don't you think that's cutting
it a little too close?

01:52:51.050 --> 01:52:54.350
We're gonna be well on our way
back home before we shoot that thing off.

01:52:56.400 --> 01:52:57.900
Why you? David!

01:52:58.900 --> 01:52:59.738
I don't...

01:53:00.063 --> 01:53:01.275
I don't understand,

01:53:01.650 --> 01:53:04.800
why you can't show someone else
how to plant the virus.

01:53:04.824 --> 01:53:06.170
Someone who is trained.
No.

01:53:06.295 --> 01:53:07.324
No, something may go wrong.

01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:10.300
I may have to think quickly, adjust the signal.

01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:11.338
Who knows? Hey.

01:53:11.663 --> 01:53:14.225
You know how like I'm always
trying to save the planet?

01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:20.100
Here's my chance.

01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:24.700
Now he gets ambitious.

01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:28.750
It's too tight.
Well, I had to borrow it. Let me see.

01:53:28.900 --> 01:53:31.250
Okay. All right, I guess that's good enough.

01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:33.600
So. How do I look?

01:53:35.100 --> 01:53:36.600
Oh, thank you. You're a lot of help.

01:53:39.850 --> 01:53:40.994
You're late!

01:53:41.819 --> 01:53:42.924
Well, you know me.

01:53:43.050 --> 01:53:44.800
I know. You like to make a big entrance.

01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:47.513
Listen.

01:53:48.238 --> 01:53:50.275
Before we do this,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:51.500
Sorry for what, babe?

01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:55.750
I should have done this a long time ago.

01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:57.598
Do you have the ring?

01:53:58.323 --> 01:53:59.374
Yes, sir.

01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:01.300
Here, make yourself useful.

01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:06.800
Witnesses?

01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:10.641
We got hung up.

01:54:10.666 --> 01:54:12.674
Well, let's get this show on the road.

01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:14.704
Dearly beloved,

01:54:14.729 --> 01:54:16.974
we're gathered here in the sight of God,

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.500
and in the presence of these witnesses,

01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:21.113
to join this man,

01:54:21.138 --> 01:54:23.524
and this woman in holy matrimony.

01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:28.000
Any person who can show good cause
why these two should not wed,

01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:31.250
please speak now
or forever hold your peace.

01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:37.600
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife

01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.800
to live together with her
in the holy state of matrimony?

01:54:41.500 --> 01:54:43.473
Will you love her, comfort her,

01:54:43.798 --> 01:54:46.624
honor and keep her in
sickness and in health

01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:48.650
and forsaking all others,

01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:52.800
keep yourself only for her
as long as you both shall live?

01:54:53.250 --> 01:54:54.250
I will.

01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:07.700
Good morning.

01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:13.700
They're a little young.

01:55:15.050 --> 01:55:16.550
That they are.

01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:20.100
They look a little nervous.

01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:24.150
<i>I need all flight crews to report
to their designated areas immediately.</i>

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:28.150
Major, can I borrow that?
Sir.

01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:30.900
Good morning.

01:55:33.150 --> 01:55:34.800
<i>Good morning.</i>

01:55:37.500 --> 01:55:39.000
<i>In less than an hour...</i>

01:55:39.950 --> 01:55:43.400
<i>aircraft from here will join
others from around the world.</i>

01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:49.100
<i>And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind.</i>

01:55:52.150 --> 01:55:53.413
<i>Mankind, that...</i>

01:55:54.138 --> 01:55:57.025
<i>word should have new meaning
for all of us today.</i>

01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:01.950
<i>We can't be consumed
by our petty differences any more.</i>

01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:06.600
<i>We will be united in our common interest.</i>

01:56:07.450 --> 01:56:11.600
<i>Perhaps it's fate that
today is the 4th of July.</i>

01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:15.900
<i>And you will once again
be fighting for our freedom.</i>

01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:20.500
<i>Not from tyranny,
oppression or persecution.</i>

01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:24.650
<i>But from annihilation.</i>

01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:28.600
<i>We're fighting for our right to live.</i>

01:56:30.100 --> 01:56:31.550
<i>To exist.</i>

01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:34.600
<i>And should we win the day,</i>

01:56:35.650 --> 01:56:40.000
<i>the 4th of July will no longer
be known as an American holiday,</i>

01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:44.200
<i>but as the day when the world
declared in one voice.</i>

01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:47.100
<i>We will not go quietly into the night!</i>

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:50.600
<i>We will not vanish without a fight!</i>

01:56:51.550 --> 01:56:53.650
<i>We're going to live on!</i>

01:56:54.250 --> 01:56:56.350
<i>We're going to survive!</i>

01:56:57.100 --> 01:57:01.150
<i>Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!</i>

01:57:26.150 --> 01:57:28.800
Let's go!
Mr. President. Right this way, sir.

01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:30.300
I've got your gear over here.

01:57:30.500 --> 01:57:31.500
Good luck!

01:57:31.650 --> 01:57:34.300
I've got you a jumpsuit for you, and the rest
of your gear is stored away in this duffel.

01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:35.950
You've got your choice of helmets.

01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:41.050
Mr. President, I'd sure like to know
what you're doing.

01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:43.750
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:47.950
I belong in the air.

01:57:54.900 --> 01:57:57.550
Okay, sir. Let's get you airborne.
Right over here.

01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:03.950
You know, as soon as I get back,
we're gonna light those fireworks, right?

01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:12.491
Here.

01:58:13.516 --> 01:58:14.574
Take these.

01:58:17.700 --> 01:58:18.900
Just in case.

01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:20.800
Where's...

01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:33.400
Just in case.

01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:38.000
I'm very proud of you.

01:58:50.050 --> 01:58:51.750
Be careful, okay?

01:58:58.700 --> 01:58:59.900
It's time.

01:59:05.650 --> 01:59:06.900
I love you.

01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:09.050
I love you.

01:59:14.100 --> 01:59:16.300
Oh, damn! Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:59:16.324 --> 01:59:18.700
Wait. Wait. We gotta find some cigars.
I can't... I never...

01:59:18.724 --> 01:59:19.649
Here, here!

01:59:19.650 --> 01:59:21.800
Take these. My last two.

01:59:22.650 --> 01:59:24.250
You are a lifesaver.

01:59:25.450 --> 01:59:27.600
Almost put a hex on the whole damn thing!

01:59:55.650 --> 01:59:57.800
<i>Missile launch.</i>
Oh, crap!

01:59:58.550 --> 02:00:00.150
What do I hit? Which one?

02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:04.900
I picked a hell of a day to quit drinking.

02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:22.150
This is our victory dance.

02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:25.000
Not until the fat lady sings.

02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:26.950
Yes, okay.

02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:29.550
This is important.

02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:31.500
Fat lady. I gotcha.

02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:35.650
<i>Open launch tunnel.</i>

02:00:55.350 --> 02:00:56.213
Shaky?

02:00:56.438 --> 02:00:57.725
Is it gonna do this the whole way?

02:00:57.749 --> 02:01:01.101
Just make sure your seat backs and tray tables
are in their upright and lock position.

02:01:01.250 --> 02:01:02.500
Yeah. Is it?

02:01:06.350 --> 02:01:07.700
Let's rock 'n' roll.

02:01:16.750 --> 02:01:18.300
What does that mean?
What do you mean...

02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:21.400
No, I got it. Look, some jerk
didn't put the diagram right.

02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:24.000
I know what I mean. I'm fine.
What do you mean saying oops there?

02:01:24.450 --> 02:01:25.950
What do you say we try that one again?

02:01:27.150 --> 02:01:28.950
Yes, yes. Yes, without the oops.

02:01:29.700 --> 02:01:30.438
This is...

02:01:30.763 --> 02:01:31.574
That a way!

02:01:38.250 --> 02:01:40.550
I have got to get me one of these!

02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:52.600
No, no, no! What was that?
What was that? Don't do that!

02:01:52.624 --> 02:01:54.800
Just trying to get a feel for
the old girl, that's all.

02:01:54.900 --> 02:01:56.600
Oh, no, no, don't. Leave her alone. Really.

02:01:56.700 --> 02:01:58.400
Look, no hands.
Steve!

02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:05.650
You're all secure, sir.
Grey, do you read me?

02:02:05.800 --> 02:02:09.400
Roger, Eagle One.
Your primary target has shifted course.

02:02:09.500 --> 02:02:12.200
<i>Which way they headed?</i>
I think our secret's out.

02:02:12.300 --> 02:02:13.950
They're headed straight for us.

02:02:14.150 --> 02:02:16.600
<i>ETA, 26 minutes.</i>

02:02:20.100 --> 02:02:21.650
You still with me over there?

02:02:21.750 --> 02:02:23.200
What the hell was I thinking?

02:02:35.000 --> 02:02:37.000
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

02:02:49.300 --> 02:02:51.400
Head straight for it.

02:02:57.250 --> 02:02:59.650
What the hell?
Don't touch them. Don't, don't, don't!

02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:01.400
I was counting on this.

02:03:01.550 --> 02:03:03.350
They are bringing us in.

02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:06.200
When the hell was you gonna tell me?

02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:12.300
We've got to work on our communication.

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.850
<i>We have visual.</i>

02:03:29.874 --> 02:03:32.100
Do not engage until we've confirmed...

02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:34.400
<i>the package has been delivered.
Roger.</i>

02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:42.750
Major, what happens if that thing gets here,

02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:45.200
before the virus is planted?

02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:48.250
Well, ma'am, this facility's
buried deep within a mountain.

02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.750
It should provide us some protection.
Great.

02:03:51.400 --> 02:03:53.100
What about the people outside?

02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:03.150
Lieutenant Sell, we got incoming.

02:05:02.750 --> 02:05:04.250
Oh, my God!

02:05:37.600 --> 02:05:38.900
Look at that!

02:05:48.700 --> 02:05:50.550
There must be thousands of them.

02:05:50.700 --> 02:05:52.900
Millions of them.
What the hell are they doing?

02:05:54.150 --> 02:05:56.200
Looks like they're preparing an invasion.

02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:27.100
Hey, I don't like this.
This is stupid. They can see us!

02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:29.050
Oh, no, no, no, no.
This thing comes fully loaded.

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:31.800
AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats and...

02:06:32.250 --> 02:06:33.600
power windows.

02:06:50.100 --> 02:06:51.400
Come on, baby.

02:06:54.150 --> 02:06:55.200
We're in.

02:07:01.500 --> 02:07:03.250
Do it. Do it.

02:07:03.550 --> 02:07:04.600
Do it.

02:07:04.900 --> 02:07:06.700
Sir, he's uploading the virus.

02:07:07.250 --> 02:07:09.500
Eagle One, the package is being delivered.

02:07:09.600 --> 02:07:11.100
<i>Stand by to engage.</i>

02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.250
<i>Roger. Eagle One, check left.</i>

02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:21.600
<i>Listen up! We have an emergency situation.</i>

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:24.000
<i>We need everyone to grab
everything they can.</i>

02:07:24.150 --> 02:07:28.050
<i>Only what you can carry.
We need to get you inside immediately.</i>

02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:32.750
The virus is in.

02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:40.000
All we can do now is...

02:07:40.625 --> 02:07:41.324
pray.

02:07:42.500 --> 02:07:43.434
Delivery complete.

02:07:43.458 --> 02:07:44.458
Engage.

02:07:44.459 --> 02:07:46.374
Delivery complete. It's a go!
It's a go!

02:07:46.500 --> 02:07:48.600
<i>Eagle One. Fox three.</i>

02:07:52.700 --> 02:07:54.450
Gentlemen, this is it.

02:07:57.800 --> 02:07:59.200
Come on, come on, come on.

02:08:12.600 --> 02:08:14.450
Virus ineffective. Disengage.

02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:16.500
Get your people out of there.
Disengage.

02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:18.650
<i>Rear flank, follow suit.</i>

02:08:19.950 --> 02:08:21.100
<i>Hold on, Command.</i>

02:08:22.700 --> 02:08:24.115
<i>I want another shot at it.</i>

02:08:24.140 --> 02:08:26.424
Sir, I strongly recommend you disengage.

02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:27.843
<i>Eagle One.</i>

02:08:28.468 --> 02:08:29.674
<i>Fox three.</i>

02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:44.600
Direct hit!

02:08:44.700 --> 02:08:48.000
It's a hit! Squadron leaders, fire at will!
Fire at will! Fire at will!

02:08:48.550 --> 02:08:50.700
<i>We're going in.
Squadron leaders, take flight.</i>

02:08:52.850 --> 02:08:54.700
<i>Eagle Six at seven.
Eagle Five at three.</i>

02:08:54.850 --> 02:08:56.650
<i>Eagle One. Fox two.</i>

02:08:57.000 --> 02:08:58.500
<i>Eagle Twenty! Fox two!</i>

02:09:07.450 --> 02:09:10.100
<i>Evasive maneuvers!
Squadron leaders, evasive maneuvers!</i>

02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:13.000
<i>Prepare to engage!</i>

02:09:17.850 --> 02:09:20.700
<i>All right, Mr. President! Here we go!</i>

02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:23.350
<i>All right, baby. I've gotcha!</i>

02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:27.500
<i>Payback's a bitch, ain't it?</i>

02:09:29.650 --> 02:09:31.900
Okay. Job's done. Let's go home.

02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:33.400
Gladly.

02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:39.350
What's up?

02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:40.350
It's stuck.

02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:42.750
What?
It's not responding. It's stuck.

02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:44.200
Try it again.

02:09:59.050 --> 02:10:00.400
Come on, come on!

02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:35.200
Steve, Steve!

02:10:41.250 --> 02:10:43.850
Hey, what the hell are you doing?
It's not me, they're overriding the system.

02:10:44.750 --> 02:10:46.250
Oh, shit!

02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:48.800
Hide.

02:10:54.450 --> 02:10:56.350
Everybody hold someone's hand.
Hold hands.

02:10:57.850 --> 02:10:58.950
Come on in.

02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:04.100
I'm not Jewish.

02:11:05.200 --> 02:11:06.350
Nobody's perfect.

02:11:09.700 --> 02:11:12.050
God! Where are they?

02:11:21.250 --> 02:11:23.050
This could be our last night on Earth.

02:11:26.650 --> 02:11:28.350
I don't wanna die a virgin.

02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:37.750
If we do, we'll both die virgins.

02:11:38.250 --> 02:11:39.650
But at least we'll be together.

02:11:48.900 --> 02:11:50.400
Are you scared?

02:11:51.450 --> 02:11:52.600
Me, too.

02:11:54.450 --> 02:11:55.700
<i>Eagle Seven, fox two.</i>

02:11:56.600 --> 02:11:57.700
<i>Eagle Three, fox two.</i>

02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:07.400
We're running out of missiles, sir.
We're just not causing enough damage.

02:12:08.200 --> 02:12:09.750
It's settling directly over us.

02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:21.450
They're preparing to fire their primary weapon.

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.500
<i>Then let's take it out before it takes us out.</i>

02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:31.450
<i>Target at 12 o'clock.</i>

02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:35.150
<i>My God, they're everywhere!</i>

02:12:36.700 --> 02:12:39.100
<i>Bandits on our tail! They're locked on!
I see them. I see them.</i>

02:12:42.450 --> 02:12:44.750
All right, squadron leaders,
I want a weapons check.

02:12:46.450 --> 02:12:48.900
You're out of time!
You've gotta disable it now!

02:12:52.350 --> 02:12:54.850
<i>I'm in range. Locking on.</i>

02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:57.950
<i>I've got tone. Eagle One, fox two!</i>

02:13:07.850 --> 02:13:09.500
<i>That is a negative impact.</i>

02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:11.800
<i>That is an NI. Negative impact.</i>

02:13:12.450 --> 02:13:14.750
<i>I'm out of missiles. Eagle Two!</i>

02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:15.950
<i>I'm on it.</i>

02:13:18.900 --> 02:13:20.200
<i>Oh, Jesus!</i>

02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:25.000
Sir, all missiles have been fired.

02:13:25.024 --> 02:13:26.400
You're out of time!
Get your ass out of there!

02:13:26.550 --> 02:13:28.950
<i>We're not done yet!</i>
Get as far away as you can!

02:13:29.100 --> 02:13:31.000
<i>Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?</i>

02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:33.500
<i>Sorry I'm late, Mr. President!</i>

02:13:37.100 --> 02:13:38.500
<i>Kind of got hung up back there!</i>

02:13:38.650 --> 02:13:41.950
<i>Pilot, you armed?
Armed and ready, sir!</i>

02:13:42.100 --> 02:13:43.600
I'm packing!

02:13:45.050 --> 02:13:46.950
Who is that guy?
Put him on speaker.

02:13:47.350 --> 02:13:49.600
Pilot, identify yourself.
<i>It's me!</i>

02:13:49.750 --> 02:13:51.350
<i>Russell Casse, sir.</i>

02:13:52.150 --> 02:13:54.150
<i>I told you I wouldn't let you down!</i>

02:13:54.350 --> 02:13:57.400
<i>Just keep those guys off me
for a few more seconds, will you?</i>

02:13:57.550 --> 02:14:01.000
Okay. Echo Niner, Echo Seven,
take flanking positions.

02:14:01.024 --> 02:14:02.700
I want you to look after this guy, okay?

02:14:03.150 --> 02:14:06.100
<i>All right, boys.
Let's give Mr. Casse some cover!</i>

02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:09.550
<i>Gentlemen! Let's plow the road!</i>

02:14:17.500 --> 02:14:19.500
<i>We'll draw them off and it'll be all yours!</i>

02:14:20.100 --> 02:14:22.750
<i>Look out! Coming through!</i>

02:14:24.350 --> 02:14:25.800
<i>I've got tone.</i>

02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:30.450
<i>Eagle Twenty. Fox two.</i>

02:14:37.650 --> 02:14:39.450
<i>Eagle Twenty. Fox two.</i>

02:14:42.750 --> 02:14:44.050
<i>It's jammed.</i>

02:14:45.150 --> 02:14:46.400
<i>It won't fire.</i>

02:14:50.100 --> 02:14:51.550
<i>Damn it!</i>

02:15:02.300 --> 02:15:03.850
<i>Do me a favor.</i>

02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:07.636
<i>Tell my children,</i>

02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:10.174
<i>I love them very much.</i>

02:15:13.200 --> 02:15:15.400
All right, you alien assholes!

02:15:16.450 --> 02:15:18.750
In the words of my generation...

02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:23.100
Up yours!

02:15:23.650 --> 02:15:25.050
Dad! What's he doing?

02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:26.450
<i>Come on, baby!</i>

02:15:26.650 --> 02:15:28.750
Come on, baby, come on!

02:15:31.700 --> 02:15:33.100
Good luck, buddy.

02:15:42.100 --> 02:15:44.100
Hello, boys!

02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:48.100
I'm back!

02:16:06.850 --> 02:16:08.250
<i>He did it!</i>

02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:10.500
<i>The son of a bitch did it!</i>

02:16:13.800 --> 02:16:15.000
All right!

02:16:37.500 --> 02:16:39.700
What your father did was very brave.

02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:43.000
You should be proud of him.

02:16:43.900 --> 02:16:45.100
I am.

02:17:03.250 --> 02:17:05.000
<i>Now we know how to take them out, general.</i>

02:17:06.100 --> 02:17:07.350
<i>Spread the word.</i>

02:17:10.450 --> 02:17:13.900
Get on the wire to every squadron
around the world.

02:17:14.100 --> 02:17:17.150
Tell them how to bring
those sons of bitches down.

02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:32.450
What do you think?

02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:35.549
Checkmate.

02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:04.500
Well, it's funny. I always thought
that things like these would kill me.

02:18:09.150 --> 02:18:10.150
Thank you.

02:18:18.450 --> 02:18:20.049
It's been a pleasure.

02:18:21.000 --> 02:18:22.650
Steve, you too.

02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:28.850
Only one thing left to do.

02:18:34.799 --> 02:18:35.850
Ready?

02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:37.850
Yes, sir.

02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:46.356
Hey, all right!

02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:48.081
Look at us!

02:18:48.100 --> 02:18:50.600
Take a look at the earthlings.
Goodbye!

02:18:51.350 --> 02:18:52.400
Y'all take care, all right?

02:18:52.424 --> 02:18:53.500
Nothing but love for you!
Goodbye!

02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:54.350
Nothing but love for you.

02:18:56.200 --> 02:18:58.200
Do you think they have any clue
what's about to happen to them?

02:18:58.700 --> 02:19:00.950
Not a chance in hell. Good night!

02:19:08.250 --> 02:19:09.299
Peace!

02:19:23.549 --> 02:19:25.750
We're loose.
Can you get us out of here in 30 seconds?

02:19:25.900 --> 02:19:27.250
I ain't heard no fat lady!

02:19:27.400 --> 02:19:29.950
Forget the fat lady. You're obessed
with the fat lady. Drive us out of here!

02:19:38.100 --> 02:19:40.350
They're chasing us.
Oh, really! You think?

02:19:48.750 --> 02:19:50.300
Oh, that was a hit. I took a hit.

02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:52.550
We're not hit! We're not hit!
Stop side-seat driving!

02:19:56.400 --> 02:19:58.750
Left, left! Tunnel, tunnel! Exit, exit, left!

02:19:58.900 --> 02:20:01.450
Where the hell do you think I'm going?
Okay, okay. We're...

02:20:20.500 --> 02:20:21.900
They're closing up on us.

02:20:21.924 --> 02:20:23.100
Is that closing?
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

02:20:23.200 --> 02:20:25.567
Must go faster, must go faster,
must go faster.

02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:27.324
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

02:20:39.450 --> 02:20:41.350
Elvis has left the building!

02:20:41.700 --> 02:20:43.400
Thank you very much.

02:20:43.850 --> 02:20:45.450
I love you, I love you, man.

02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:19.450
They're going down all over the world,
Tom. We got them beat.

02:22:20.300 --> 02:22:23.050
How about our two delivery boys?
Any word from them?

02:22:26.900 --> 02:22:28.482
We lost contact with,

02:22:29.407 --> 02:22:32.024
Captain Hiller and Levinson
nearly 20 minutes ago.

02:22:35.200 --> 02:22:36.250
Hold it!

02:22:36.900 --> 02:22:38.650
Hold on, sir.
I've got something on radar.

02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:28.100
Sorry, sir.

02:23:29.450 --> 02:23:30.700
Good job.
Thank you.

02:23:31.050 --> 02:23:33.100
Well done, captain.
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

02:23:41.150 --> 02:23:42.200
David...

02:23:44.750 --> 02:23:46.000
Not bad.

02:23:49.650 --> 02:23:50.800
Thank you, Mr. President.

02:23:53.150 --> 02:23:54.700
Not too bad at all.

02:23:56.150 --> 02:23:57.550
Oh, so this is healthy?

02:23:59.150 --> 02:24:00.600
I could get used to it.

02:24:18.650 --> 02:24:21.000
Happy 4th of July, Daddy.

02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:23.050
Same to you, Munchkin.

02:24:25.300 --> 02:24:26.850
Didn't I promise you fireworks?

02:24:27.800 --> 02:24:28.800
Yeah.
