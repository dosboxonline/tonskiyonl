¶¶

00:50.117 --> 00:52.484
- The worst tragedies
in human history

00:52.486 --> 00:56.255
occurred when we
faced something unknown,

00:56.257 --> 00:58.157
frightening.

01:00.127 --> 01:01.460
- Today we are going
to witness

01:01.462 --> 01:03.062
a unique astronomical
phenomenon.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.564
- An unidentified flying object
was detected.

01:05.566 --> 01:09.401
- 477, at ten o'clock.
- Roger that. I have a visual.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.836
- No pressure,

01:10.838 --> 01:12.704
but it's going to be
another fifty years

01:12.706 --> 01:14.640
till a meteor shower
hits again.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.544
- It's big, 650.
I have a visual.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.712
- The object entered the
atmosphere from the west.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.314
It has moved further north.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.183
- People are watching
the meteor shower.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.517
- Sveta is all alone up there.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.786
- 477, repeat!
- It's huge!

01:28.289 --> 01:30.689
- Humans waited
thousands of years

01:30.691 --> 01:34.660
to make contact with an
extraterrestrial intelligence.

01:34.795 --> 01:37.196
- Disaster in Moscow's
Chertanovo residential area.

01:37.198 --> 01:38.431
An unidentified object crashed

01:38.432 --> 01:39.665
into several apartment
buildings.

01:39.667 --> 01:42.634
The death toll has yet
to be confirmed.

01:43.270 --> 01:46.672
Experts are still reluctant
to confirm eyewitness accounts

01:46.674 --> 01:50.776
that the incident was an alien
invasion. Nevertheless...

01:51.479 --> 01:52.544
- This means war, right?

01:52.546 --> 01:56.315
- It depends on
what they do next.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.649
- Who are "they"?

01:58.285 --> 02:00.853
- We can't just sit and wait
after what they've done.

02:00.855 --> 02:02.387
- They are to blame.

02:02.389 --> 02:04.756
Otherwise Sveta
would still be alive.

02:05.860 --> 02:09.428
- Leave it! Yulia!
- What do you mean?

02:12.700 --> 02:13.832
- Left!

02:14.368 --> 02:15.601
Yulia!

02:15.603 --> 02:17.169
- Don't be afraid.

02:17.438 --> 02:19.838
- We don't know
what they are going to do.

02:20.174 --> 02:24.743
Right now our main task is
to avoid a direct conflict.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.745
- This is a unique opportunity
for humanity.

02:26.747 --> 02:28.881
- He saved me.
I owe him.

02:28.883 --> 02:31.783
- It's a chance to find out
more about ourselves.

02:31.785 --> 02:33.318
To know who we are.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.354
- I always knew
you were special.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.555
- Transfer complete.

02:36.556 --> 02:37.755
- This is a transmitter
of kinetic material.

02:37.758 --> 02:39.424
You will never be able
to remove it.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.043
- Got it.

02:41.044 --> 02:42.460
- We are not allowed
to make contact.

02:42.463 --> 02:45.264
We can't let you
get hold of our technology.

02:45.266 --> 02:46.698
- Gratitude.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.500
Loneliness.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.386
Love.

02:50.387 --> 02:52.271
- Love and hate help you
fight the fear of death.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.674
Without death there is no need
for love or hate.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.176
- You love him, right?
- I do.

02:57.178 --> 02:59.228
- You dumped me
because of him.

02:59.229 --> 03:01.279
- They're not what we thought!
They're better than us!

03:01.282 --> 03:03.615
- This is our Earth!

03:06.654 --> 03:08.253
- If you come close,
it will all be over.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.788
Sol will blow up
the spacecraft.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.524
- We will all die.
You and us. Understand?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.426
- What are you doing with her?

03:16.497 --> 03:18.664
[yelling]

03:22.403 --> 03:23.669

03:28.576 --> 03:30.342
- What are you doing
with her?

03:31.979 --> 03:34.580
What are you doing
with her?!

03:35.516 --> 03:37.849
- Hakon could have
lived forever,

03:37.985 --> 03:40.619
but he gave up his life
for her.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.956
Now I have to review
the results of the mission.

03:43.958 --> 03:46.625
They will affect
the future of our worlds.

03:47.728 --> 03:51.496
- People say they can't go on
living like this.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.799
And me?

03:55.469 --> 03:56.935
No way.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.655
- Azimuth adjustment.
Five degrees right.

04:16.657 --> 04:18.524
- Roger that.

04:18.525 --> 04:20.392
- Sustainer engine, stop.
- Roger.

04:22.863 --> 04:26.531
- 314, you are on the
calculated flight path now.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.968
- Check.
- Positive.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.873
- The country's leading
research institutes

04:34.875 --> 04:37.442
are decoding the technologies
left by the aliens.

04:37.444 --> 04:40.746
Scientists are expecting
a breakthrough any time now,

04:40.748 --> 04:43.649
potentially leading to advances
not only in military capability,

04:43.651 --> 04:45.317
but also providing us
with advanced tools

04:45.319 --> 04:46.918
in such diverse
fields as medicine,

04:46.920 --> 04:48.720
energy production
and ship building.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.622
- The country's leading
research institutes

04:50.624 --> 04:52.858
are carefully working
on decoding the tech--

04:52.860 --> 04:54.660
- Despite UN recommendations,

04:54.662 --> 04:56.061
Russia has refused
to let foreign experts

04:56.063 --> 04:57.413
examine the site.

04:57.414 --> 04:58.764
This was the impetus
for the extension

04:58.766 --> 05:00.365
of economic sanctions
against Russia.

05:00.367 --> 05:03.635
[speaking foreign languages]

05:03.637 --> 05:06.471
In an attempt to avoid
making the same mistakes again,

05:06.473 --> 05:08.407
a special unit
has been created

05:08.409 --> 05:10.375
to monitor so-called
"deep space."

05:10.377 --> 05:12.044
Russian Aerospace Forces
have dedicated

05:12.046 --> 05:13.679
satellites to support this.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.681
The newly appointed Head
of the Extraterrestrial

05:15.683 --> 05:17.666

05:17.667 --> 05:19.650
is the deputy commander of
the Russian Aerospace Forces,

05:19.653 --> 05:22.020
Lieutenant General Valentin
Lebedev.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.357
During the Shanghai Summit,
a fundamental decision was made

05:25.359 --> 05:28.360
to allow countries
to destroy alien objects

05:28.362 --> 05:31.396
which could potentially
threaten Planet Earth.

05:31.398 --> 05:33.398
Those countries capable
of attacking

05:33.400 --> 05:34.900
an enemy in outer space,

05:34.902 --> 05:37.769
namely Russia,
the United States and China,

05:37.771 --> 05:40.672
adopted the required
response protocols.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.942
Details of the events in Moscow
two years ago are still murky,

05:43.944 --> 05:46.378
but government agencies
assure the public

05:46.380 --> 05:49.381
that efforts are being made
to guarantee that no spacecraft

05:49.383 --> 05:53.018
will ever be able to arrive
at our planet unnoticed again.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.099
Chara, where are you?

09:50.657 --> 09:52.123
- Essentially there is almost
no difference

09:52.125 --> 09:53.925
between human
and artificial intelligence.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.327
With the exception,
of course,

09:55.329 --> 09:57.062
of our individual
empathetic abilities,

09:57.064 --> 09:59.764
which we deem
our personality.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.132
And when we claim,
"I feel something,"

10:01.134 --> 10:02.834
what we mean in reality is

10:02.836 --> 10:04.269
we're aware
of a potential solution

10:04.271 --> 10:05.670
without grasping
the algorithm

10:05.672 --> 10:07.372
that leads us
to the solution.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.907
But here's the thing:

10:08.909 --> 10:10.842
We don't have to understand
everything.

10:11.244 --> 10:14.279
- Any news from the lab?
Make any headway yet?

10:15.215 --> 10:17.215
- That is classified
information.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.352
If I tell you, then my guards
are going to have to shoot you.

10:20.354 --> 10:22.754
- Intuition is not a miracle.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.190
It is a carefully planned
strategy.

10:25.359 --> 10:27.726
Vitalik here is quite lucky

leg off for that.

11:00.293 --> 11:02.327
- I hope you find Chara.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.763
- Vitalik has been programmed

11:04.765 --> 11:06.431
to believe that
any physical contact

11:06.433 --> 11:07.866
is a sign of approval,

11:07.868 --> 11:10.135
whether you pet him
or hit him.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.137
This is what we call
"limited perception."

11:12.139 --> 11:14.640
Let me repeat.

11:14.641 --> 11:17.142
No artificial intelligence
can surpass human intelligence

11:17.144 --> 11:20.111
because we are the perfect
artificial intelligence.

For now.

11:22.149 --> 11:23.982
They are our future.

11:24.251 --> 11:27.419
However, unlike us
they will be almost immortal.

11:27.421 --> 11:29.087
It is very likely that
they will even grow

11:29.089 --> 11:30.889
to be emotional
because emotions are

11:30.891 --> 11:32.023
inevitable after-effects

11:32.025 --> 11:34.159
due to the complexity
of the system.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.027
We should however
be able to

11:36.029 --> 11:38.997
nullify their unwanted emotions
through certain protocols.

11:38.999 --> 11:41.332
- How about us?
- What about us?

11:41.768 --> 11:44.169
- Can you nullify
our unwanted emotions?

11:44.171 --> 11:45.303
So we'll wag our tails

11:45.305 --> 11:47.405
even though we just got
hit in the face?

11:47.407 --> 11:49.074
- Theoretically, yes.

11:49.076 --> 11:52.310

certain parts of the brain.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.062

Soon enough

to feel sympathy

11:59.986 --> 12:02.187
and aversion,
hatred and love.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.722
- We need love and hate

12:03.724 --> 12:05.123
to save us from
the fear of death.

I can offer you a plan.

15:04.604 --> 15:08.172
First, we take out the guards.
Then you get plastic surgery.

15:09.342 --> 15:12.076
We shave your head.
- Stop here.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.647
- Then you dress up as a nun
and we smuggle you to Mongolia.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.649
Then you ride
a tiny horse to Tibet

15:17.651 --> 15:21.219
and from there you sail across
the Sea of Japan to Kamchatka.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.655
No access to social networks
for a while.

15:23.657 --> 15:27.191
But nature is simply
amazing there.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.598
- Thanks for the offer, Dad.
Sounds interesting.

15:35.135 --> 15:38.036
But we'll have to suffer
a bit longer.

suspended.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.598
Maximum acceleration
for Combat Course 2.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.367
- Good. Carry on.

16:11.137 --> 16:13.304
What do you think?
Impressive, huh?

16:13.306 --> 16:15.707
- Did you find out
what it is made of?

16:15.709 --> 16:17.342
- Water, in fact.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.544
The exoskeleton
absorbs carbon dioxide

16:19.546 --> 16:22.046
to create energy
for regeneration.

16:22.048 --> 16:24.182
We are dealing with
biotechnology here.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.384
Some sort of photosynthesis.

16:26.720 --> 16:28.219
- Hello.
- Hello.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.520
- Hello.

16:30.290 --> 16:31.689
How long is he
going to jump around?

16:31.691 --> 16:34.025
- Ten more minutes,
comrade general.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.628
- Can he hear us?

16:36.629 --> 16:39.230
- Our engineers installed a
radio headset in the helmet.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.633
- A Russian-Extraterrestrial
coproduction.

16:50.577 --> 16:52.143
- Hello, Yulia.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.447
Shall we begin?

16:59.386 --> 17:00.785
- I'm ready.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.287
- What did you feel

17:03.490 --> 17:06.557
when you found out that the
spacecraft crashed in the city?

17:06.726 --> 17:09.293
- Nothing.
I blacked out.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.764
They rescued me.

17:12.766 --> 17:15.166
- Okay. And then?

17:15.335 --> 17:18.136
When you found out that
your friend had been killed?

17:18.505 --> 17:22.440
- What do you usually feel
when someone close to you dies?

17:22.642 --> 17:24.542
- Yulia, please,
keep still.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.211
We don't want to compromise
the experiment.

17:27.213 --> 17:30.081
And then you wanted
to take revenge.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.649
Is that right?

17:31.651 --> 17:33.451
- I can't remember.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.586
[water rippling]

17:38.124 --> 17:39.424
- And then?

17:39.559 --> 17:43.327
Why did you decide
to help the creature?

17:44.798 --> 17:46.164
- I've told you
a thousand times.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.231
You want to hear it again?

17:48.701 --> 17:52.136
- Her negative emotions
generate a significant upsurge.

17:52.138 --> 17:53.371
See?

17:53.640 --> 17:57.642
Yulia, what about
your boyfriend Artyom?

17:57.644 --> 17:59.744
What happened
between you two?

18:01.281 --> 18:03.648
- Nothing.
We broke up.

18:05.151 --> 18:07.318
- Can you tell me why?

18:07.587 --> 18:11.089
Did you do it
because of the alien?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.825
At what point

18:13.827 --> 18:17.762
did you start
having feelings for him?

18:23.837 --> 18:25.803
- Do I have to answer?

18:27.707 --> 18:31.242
- All of us have been hoping
for a breakthrough.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.846
Sorry to keep reminding you,
but Yulia is all we have.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.714
If we were given free rein...

18:36.716 --> 18:38.716
- What? Do you want me
to let you

18:38.718 --> 18:40.251
treat her like a lab rat?

18:42.489 --> 18:45.423
- She is our only key
to these technologies.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.742

somebody wants to talk to you.
Okay?

19:11.684 --> 19:13.251
[breathes deeply]

We're done here!

19:41.648 --> 19:43.281
- Keep talking!

19:43.283 --> 19:46.717
- I... I don't really know
what to say.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.853
- Get me out of here!

19:51.558 --> 19:54.292
- I'm sorry.
- You killed me!

19:54.827 --> 19:57.528
- No.
I didn't mean to kill you.

19:57.530 --> 19:59.931
I was shooting at him.

19:59.933 --> 20:03.701
I wanted us all
to die there.

20:03.703 --> 20:05.836
But I survived.

20:06.639 --> 20:09.607
And I had a CVA.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.611
A cerebrovascular accident.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.513
A stroke.

20:15.748 --> 20:16.847
[Yulia screaming]

20:18.651 --> 20:22.887
But it was you who initially
wanted to kill him.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.173
- Go on!

20:25.174 --> 20:26.991
- Nothing would
have happened if...

20:27.427 --> 20:29.894
- Dad!

Please, don't jump
to conclusions!

20:41.441 --> 20:42.940
General!
- Where is she?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.778
- General Lebedev...

20:48.348 --> 20:50.581
- Call for backup!

20:50.583 --> 20:52.283
- Easy, easy!

20:52.285 --> 20:53.885

20:53.886 --> 20:55.486

here?

20:55.488 --> 20:57.688
- Serving my country.

20:58.024 --> 21:01.626
- Take him away!
- Why do they keep me in prison?

21:01.961 --> 21:04.862
Your daughter is okay.

21:04.864 --> 21:07.798
You are doing well, too.

21:08.501 --> 21:11.669
Why me?
Why do you keep me locked up?

Yulia?

21:34.460 --> 21:36.560
No more research.

21:37.363 --> 21:39.864
I will make sure they stop.
You believe me?

21:41.934 --> 21:43.701
- You can do anything.

21:49.509 --> 21:51.575
- I'll wait in the car.
- No.

21:52.545 --> 21:54.912
[breathing heavily]

21:54.914 --> 21:58.516
Can I go unescorted for once?
Without the guards?

21:58.518 --> 22:01.452
Can I just be alone
by myself?

22:01.954 --> 22:03.954
I'm begging you, Dad.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.326
Please.

22:33.386 --> 22:34.685
- Hello, sir.
- Ivan.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.821
You can't go back
to your family today.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.956
- They've forgotten me anyway,
no problem.

22:38.958 --> 22:41.892
- One more thing.
Put on some other clothes.

22:42.729 --> 22:43.794
- Like what?

22:44.797 --> 22:45.996

24:06.746 --> 24:08.512
- She's had enough.
Thank you.

24:10.049 --> 24:11.148
- My little brother.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.217
He never lets me go
anywhere alone.

24:15.822 --> 24:19.156
My name is Yulia.
- I know. I'm Ivan.

24:20.960 --> 24:23.627
- I know you can't stand me.

24:25.198 --> 24:27.531
You follow me
everywhere I go.

24:27.533 --> 24:29.834
Keeping an eye on
my boring life.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.772
Annoying job, isn't it?

24:35.775 --> 24:38.142
You have absolutely
no idea...

24:39.178 --> 24:41.111
why I'm so important.

24:44.250 --> 24:45.916
- My last assignment
was to protect

24:45.918 --> 24:47.718
the chieftain of a small
and proud tribe.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.653
Every week somebody
tried to finish him off,

24:49.655 --> 24:51.689
usually sniper shots
or homemade land mines.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.691
One day they even blew up
our convoy.

24:53.693 --> 24:55.476
When it was quiet,

24:55.477 --> 24:57.260
he would buy underage girls
from another tribe

24:57.263 --> 24:58.796
and took advantage of them.

24:58.798 --> 25:01.699
I was put in charge
of protecting him because

25:01.701 --> 25:03.567
he was a mediator in talks

25:03.569 --> 25:05.703
with even more abhorrent
bastards

25:05.705 --> 25:07.805
who could exchange prisoners.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.740
So, no,

25:10.576 --> 25:12.510
this job is not annoying.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.212
I don't think that
you deserve less protection

25:15.214 --> 25:17.781
than the bearded pedophile
I told you about.

25:22.588 --> 25:24.655
- Damn.
That's not fair.

25:26.893 --> 25:30.094
I thought I would win
the Saddest Story Award.

25:30.830 --> 25:33.731
- Yulia, I am very grateful
to your father,

25:33.733 --> 25:36.967
and I promised to get you
home before midnight.

25:37.737 --> 25:38.936

26:21.080 --> 26:22.680

to stay with you.

- But she is going with me.

26:25.284 --> 26:27.017
Hit on somebody else.

26:27.019 --> 26:29.620
- You think you can go
against her will

26:29.622 --> 26:31.221
because you are
authorized to use force

26:31.223 --> 26:33.023
and carry a concealed weapon?

26:33.025 --> 26:35.626
But you are wrong.
Please, don't resist

30:40.539 --> 30:43.373
for unauthorized passengers
to exit if they wish.

30:48.314 --> 30:50.848
- Sol!
- [Sol] Updating the route.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.552

I am in pursuit.

[car horns sounding]
[siren wailing]

31:50.109 --> 31:51.475
- General Lebedev.

31:51.644 --> 31:53.277
I lost them.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.948
- Let me ask you again.
Were you driving the car?

31:57.950 --> 31:59.550
- Technically, yes.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.151
But the car was out
of my control.

32:05.524 --> 32:07.524
Hold on.
It was driving itself.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.159
[cellphone ringing]
Do you understand?

32:09.662 --> 32:11.161

- Chara!

33:21.600 --> 33:22.766
- Chara!

33:32.211 --> 33:34.644
- I feel you are suffering.

33:36.749 --> 33:38.782
- I buried you.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.785
I was sure you were dead.

33:42.388 --> 33:43.720
But you...

33:44.757 --> 33:47.057
You never... even...

33:47.426 --> 33:49.526
[crying]

33:49.762 --> 33:52.396
Why didn't you come back
earlier?

33:55.267 --> 33:58.268
- Last time
everything went wrong.

34:09.381 --> 34:11.314
Careful, threshold.

34:18.490 --> 34:22.225
- How long...
have you been here?

34:22.227 --> 34:23.827
- 123 days.

34:24.463 --> 34:25.796
[Yulia sighs]

34:25.798 --> 34:27.464
- Holy shit!

34:28.267 --> 34:31.368
Wait, but how could you...
You don't have...

34:31.370 --> 34:33.503
Did Sol print you money?

34:33.505 --> 34:35.305
- No. I have a job.

34:35.307 --> 34:37.707
I have a house.
I have a vegetable garden.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.485
- A vegetable garden...

34:53.425 --> 34:55.659
You survived here all alone?

34:55.794 --> 34:58.361
- A human being can
adapt to any condition.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.299
[dog barking]

35:12.177 --> 35:13.543
- I wanted to tell...

35:14.646 --> 35:15.779
you.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.281
I'll come back tomorrow.

35:18.283 --> 35:19.349
Yeah?

35:19.585 --> 35:21.585
- Google helped me.
- I see.

35:21.587 --> 35:23.820
Stop doing that.
I hate traitors.

35:23.822 --> 35:25.322
- Chara, go away.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.858
- I mean, all of you here,
by the way.

35:27.860 --> 35:31.528
- You feel hurt thinking
that you suffered more than me?

35:32.831 --> 35:34.164
- No.

35:36.335 --> 35:37.818
I don't know.

35:37.819 --> 35:39.302
- I spent a week
of my time in space

35:39.304 --> 35:41.571
which is equal
to two years here.

35:42.341 --> 35:43.874
Sol stayed in your system

35:43.876 --> 35:45.842
because I never would have
survived the transition.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.377
- And then what?

35:49.648 --> 35:51.515
Were you supposed to leave?

35:53.619 --> 35:54.851
- Yes, I was.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.156
I violated the protocol.

38:32.778 --> 38:33.877
- Yes?

38:33.879 --> 38:36.546
- Dad.
Hi, it's me.

38:37.749 --> 38:39.015
- Where are you?

38:39.685 --> 38:40.984
- With him.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.387
Can you turn on the camera?

38:44.389 --> 38:45.588
- I can.

38:47.659 --> 38:49.326
- I just wanted to see
your face.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.029
If mom were alive,
I would call her

38:53.031 --> 38:54.964
to say that I love her.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.101
I love you, too.

38:59.071 --> 39:01.404
Just like her.
Honest.

39:01.406 --> 39:04.107
I don't tell you that
very often.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.714
I have to fly away.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.116
- Far away?

39:14.052 --> 39:15.385
- Far away.

39:15.387 --> 39:16.953
Dad, don't say anything.

39:16.955 --> 39:19.356
You know
I don't belong here.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.059
Everything is going
to be okay.

39:24.796 --> 39:26.529
I promise you.

39:27.099 --> 39:28.598
You trust me?

39:29.801 --> 39:30.767
- Of course.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.539
[call ends]

39:38.944 --> 39:41.077
[Yulia sighs]

39:42.581 --> 39:44.547
Track the signal and deploy
the response unit.

39:44.549 --> 39:45.982
- Be careful.
Don't use any force.

39:45.984 --> 39:46.916
- Yes, sir.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.792
- You can even smoke here.

39:56.962 --> 39:59.629
- First of all,
you don't smoke when you eat.

40:00.599 --> 40:04.000
And then I quit smoking
when my boyfriend was killed.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.002
- You didn't have to.

40:06.004 --> 40:08.538
This thing nullifies
the damage to your health.

40:12.844 --> 40:14.844
- What if I don't want
to pollute the planet?

40:14.846 --> 40:16.045
I like it here.

40:17.649 --> 40:19.549
Mmm...

40:19.718 --> 40:20.950
Delicious!

40:35.634 --> 40:37.467
What if we don't fly away?

40:38.770 --> 40:41.738
Maybe settle down a bit closer?
Like Kamchatka.

40:44.176 --> 40:45.575
I don't even have
a passport.

40:45.577 --> 40:46.843
How are we going to cross
the border?

40:47.078 --> 40:48.645
- You will.

40:48.647 --> 40:51.915
But... we'll have to
cook up a corruption scam.

40:51.917 --> 40:53.483
- [scoffs]

40:53.485 --> 40:55.018
Oh my God!

40:55.554 --> 40:57.854
You have a sense
of humor now!

40:59.024 --> 41:01.558
Okay. Tell your...

41:01.693 --> 41:04.828
intergalactic government
that I agree to everything.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.563
But if you ever...

41:07.532 --> 41:10.733
dump me for some
Martian girl...

41:11.703 --> 41:12.902
Promise you never will.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.572
- A promise is an illusion
based on

41:15.574 --> 41:16.906
the assertion
of absolute probability

41:16.908 --> 41:18.174
of your wish in the future.

41:18.176 --> 41:20.176
But considering there are
no competitive

I...

41:27.052 --> 41:30.653
How can I make that animal
understand that that is my bed?

41:30.922 --> 41:33.206
- No chance.

41:33.207 --> 41:35.491
Even your technology
can't help you there.

41:36.228 --> 41:38.761
I won't go anywhere
without Chara.

41:39.564 --> 41:41.130
End of discussion.

41:44.970 --> 41:47.704
- Attention lab workers.

41:47.706 --> 41:52.075
All personnel and equipment
are to be evacuated immediately.

41:53.845 --> 41:57.146

Keep it even!

41:57.148 --> 41:59.782
- Where is the response unit?
- Arriving shortly.

42:00.218 --> 42:02.218
- General Lebedev!

42:02.219 --> 42:04.219
They are about to break off
the manipulator arm...

42:04.222 --> 42:05.989
- What about the prisoner?

42:05.991 --> 42:07.757
- Put him in the car.
- Let's go!

42:07.759 --> 42:09.859
- Put him in the LMV.
- Where are you taking me?

42:09.861 --> 42:12.028
- We'll see.
Waiting for an order.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.097
- Can you give me a smoke?

42:14.099 --> 42:16.533
Or do you need an order
for that, too?

42:18.270 --> 42:20.069
He will deceive you.

42:22.974 --> 42:25.174
It runs in their family.

42:31.850 --> 42:33.249
- What are you waiting for?

42:33.785 --> 42:35.251
Take him to the car.

42:35.253 --> 42:37.086
- Yes, sir.
Move!

42:47.165 --> 42:48.698
- Target located.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.167
- It's the response unit,
comrade general.

42:51.169 --> 42:53.053
- Report.

42:53.054 --> 42:54.938
- I see a man and a girl.
No cause for alarm.

42:54.940 --> 42:57.040
No reason to use weapons.

42:57.042 --> 42:59.175
- Then lower your guns, major!
Do you hear me?

42:59.177 --> 43:01.177
- I repeat.
They are unarmed.

43:01.179 --> 43:04.013
No cause for alarm.
- Lower your guns, I tell you!

43:07.018 --> 43:08.251
Lower your guns!

43:10.655 --> 43:12.021
- [Sol] Shoot to kill!

43:12.157 --> 43:13.756
- Repeat the order.

43:13.758 --> 43:15.825
- Are you deaf?
Hold your fire!

43:15.827 --> 43:18.194
Do not use any force
unless necessary!

43:18.196 --> 43:19.329
- Center 2.0 here.

43:19.331 --> 43:21.664
Order the response unit
to stand down.

43:21.666 --> 43:24.000

You can come back.
But she must be eliminated.

51:39.263 --> 51:40.663
[radio chatter]

51:41.399 --> 51:42.565
- Out of the way!

51:42.567 --> 51:45.167
- Step aside!
No one move!

51:45.169 --> 51:46.469
Lower your weapons!

51:46.704 --> 51:48.270
You wait here!

51:54.412 --> 51:56.745
[horn blaring]

52:08.593 --> 52:11.260
[siren wailing]

52:50.735 --> 52:52.334
[Yulia gasping]

52:53.237 --> 52:56.305
- I'll get a doctor.
- Wait. She needs water.

52:58.943 --> 53:00.442
A lot of water.

53:07.218 --> 53:09.818
[rap music]
¶¶

53:12.256 --> 53:13.756
[honking horn]

53:13.758 --> 53:15.291
- What the hell?

53:17.261 --> 53:18.627
What are you doing?

53:19.931 --> 53:21.730
Are you high or something?

53:22.533 --> 53:23.599
[car door closes]

53:23.601 --> 53:24.967
Hey!

53:27.271 --> 53:28.337
Wait!

53:30.241 --> 53:31.307
Where are you going?

53:31.776 --> 53:32.942
Wait!

53:32.944 --> 53:35.211
Stop!
Where are you going?

53:37.682 --> 53:40.216
- Call in Air Defense
and Home Affairs.

53:42.253 --> 53:44.453
Where?
Got it. On my way.

53:44.455 --> 53:45.521
- What about that?

53:45.522 --> 53:46.588
- Take it to the Ministry
of Defense.

53:46.591 --> 53:48.657
Personally.
- Yes, sir.

53:54.565 --> 53:56.799
[tense music]
¶¶

54:32.003 --> 54:34.837
- [groaning in pain]

54:37.375 --> 54:39.441
- What do they want
from her?

54:39.844 --> 54:42.778
- It's not the military.
Ra is in control now.

54:43.714 --> 54:46.749
- Ra?
- A spaceship.

54:46.751 --> 54:48.751
It uses protocols to amend
the development

54:48.753 --> 54:50.486
of other civilizations.

54:50.488 --> 54:52.421
You call that war.

54:53.758 --> 54:55.724
- How can it do that?

54:56.027 --> 54:58.661
- You yourselves have given it
all the necessary data.

54:59.463 --> 55:01.063
What you look like,
personal information,

55:01.065 --> 55:02.364
voice samples.

55:02.366 --> 55:04.433
Almost nothing is safe.

55:04.635 --> 55:06.769
Ra can access all of it.

55:06.771 --> 55:09.872
And it can manipulate
the flow of information.

55:10.341 --> 55:13.842
The military doesn't know
who is giving the orders.

55:14.512 --> 55:16.478
Any more questions?

55:17.481 --> 55:18.681
- Yes.

55:20.651 --> 55:22.318
What does it want?

55:23.387 --> 55:26.055
- It wants the one thing
you failed to do:

55:26.057 --> 55:27.856
kill Yulia.

55:31.395 --> 55:32.594
- Have I been
correctly informed

55:32.596 --> 55:33.929
that no one
has been killed yet?

55:33.931 --> 55:35.831
Only injured?
- For the moment, yes.

55:35.833 --> 55:37.399
- Comrade officers!

55:37.401 --> 55:39.401
- The President
and the Minister of Defense

55:39.403 --> 55:40.569
have been briefed.

55:40.571 --> 55:43.505
They are on their way home
from the summit.

55:43.507 --> 55:45.407
It is a 12-hour flight.

55:45.409 --> 55:46.875
Please, be seated.

55:49.547 --> 55:51.013
- Who authorized the attack?

55:51.015 --> 55:52.681
- You are out of line,
comrade general!

55:52.683 --> 55:54.416
- That was my daughter!

55:54.418 --> 55:56.685
Who gave the order to attack?
What's going on?

55:56.687 --> 55:58.987
- Easy, Valentin.
Sit down.

55:59.990 --> 56:02.524
Sit down, General Lebedev!

56:02.827 --> 56:05.094
Who is here
from the Aerospace Forces?

56:05.096 --> 56:06.762
Who gave the order
to the pilots?

56:06.764 --> 56:09.131
- I did.

56:09.132 --> 56:11.499
- Who ordered a missile launch
in the center of Moscow?

56:12.737 --> 56:14.636
- You did, comrade general.

56:17.475 --> 56:20.442
- I ordered you to shoot
at my own daughter?

56:20.444 --> 56:21.844
- We can retrieve
the recording.

56:21.846 --> 56:23.479
It was given via
an internal channel.

56:23.481 --> 56:25.381
- Do it right now!

56:32.757 --> 56:33.989
- Krylov,
send two K-52 choppers

56:33.991 --> 56:35.491
to the Moskvoretskaya
embankment.

56:35.493 --> 56:36.992
Right away.
The target is underwater.

56:36.994 --> 56:38.761
Shoot to destroy.

56:38.763 --> 56:40.596
- Downtown, comrade general?
- Copy that.

56:40.598 --> 56:43.132
- Do I have to repeat myself?
- No, sir. I'll give the order.

56:43.134 --> 56:45.434
- You need to take a look
at the news.

56:46.470 --> 56:48.637
- Put the news
up on the big screens.

56:48.639 --> 56:50.639
To recap,
Yulia Lebedeva is wanted

56:50.641 --> 56:52.474
on suspicion
of a terror attack.

56:52.476 --> 56:54.476
She may be responsible
for bombing

56:54.478 --> 56:56.011
a Moscow apartment block.

56:56.013 --> 56:58.147
The final death toll
is still unknown.

56:58.149 --> 57:01.450
At the moment, 24 people
have been declared dead.

57:01.652 --> 57:03.485
We have received a video

57:03.487 --> 57:05.888
which one could call
"The Lebedev Manifesto."

57:05.890 --> 57:07.890
We believe it was made
right after

57:07.892 --> 57:09.825
or just before the bombing.

57:09.994 --> 57:12.561
- Can you hear me?
Then pay attention.

57:12.930 --> 57:15.931
Three years ago,
a UFO crashed in Chertanovo.

57:15.933 --> 57:19.134
You claimed it was
an alien act of aggression.

57:19.503 --> 57:21.603
That is a lie.
We attacked them.

57:21.739 --> 57:24.640
And then I was treated
like a lab rat.

57:24.642 --> 57:26.642
My father personally
led the tests.

57:26.644 --> 57:28.644
I demand that all
classified information

57:28.646 --> 57:30.012
sealed by the Ministry
of Defense

57:30.014 --> 57:31.547
be made public.

57:31.549 --> 57:34.082
The military stole
alien technologies

57:34.084 --> 57:36.819
and has used them to
secretly develop new weapons.

57:36.821 --> 57:40.556
I know you think that
no one can stop you.

57:40.558 --> 57:42.024
That is not true.

57:43.928 --> 57:45.093
- Now what?

57:45.095 --> 57:46.795
- She desperately needs
pure water.

57:46.797 --> 57:47.729
Go and get some.

57:48.098 --> 57:49.932
- Water?
- Yes.

57:49.934 --> 57:51.533
Go to the store,
grab some bottles

57:51.535 --> 57:53.001
and give money
to the cashier.

57:54.171 --> 57:57.105
- Look, I know how
shopping works.

57:57.107 --> 57:58.874
You spent three years
away from society.

57:58.876 --> 58:00.709
You may have lost
some skills.

58:01.712 --> 58:04.646
- You go to the store.
- No. You go to the store.

58:04.648 --> 58:07.483
- [Yulia] Can one of you go
or else I'll have to do it.

58:08.953 --> 58:11.620
- You are the only one
not on the wanted list.

58:18.929 --> 58:20.596
Got any cash?
- I have a job...

58:20.598 --> 58:21.897
- [Yulia] Just go!

58:24.735 --> 58:27.703
I thought you would understand
how dangerous it was.

58:27.705 --> 58:29.288
To no avail.

58:29.289 --> 58:30.872
Now I will do whatever
it takes to...

58:34.111 --> 58:36.578
[Yulia] Is war the only
language you speak?

58:36.580 --> 58:39.147
Excellent.
Then war it is.

58:39.149 --> 58:41.116
Be ready
for more explosions.

58:41.118 --> 58:43.685
This earth is no longer
solely yours.

58:43.687 --> 58:44.853
- The question remains:

58:44.855 --> 58:46.989
Why was the public
not told earlier

58:46.991 --> 58:48.924
that the young woman
not only had contact

58:48.926 --> 58:50.559
with the alien

58:50.560 --> 58:52.193
but also received
an object from him.

58:52.563 --> 58:54.263
Its purpose still remains
unknown.

58:54.265 --> 58:55.597
- Where is the broadcast
coming from?

58:55.599 --> 58:56.732
- From you. You're live.

58:56.734 --> 58:58.901
- We're not on the air!
Mute the audio!

58:58.903 --> 59:01.003
- What's wrong?
Who's on the air?

59:01.005 --> 59:02.604
- ...Ministry of Defense.

59:02.606 --> 59:04.740
No real progress
has been made...

59:04.742 --> 59:05.974
- My, my!

59:05.976 --> 59:07.276
- The broadcast center
is being bypassed.

59:07.278 --> 59:09.278
It's all over the Internet,
too.

59:09.280 --> 59:12.581
- What's going on?
- Is it a cyber attack?

59:12.583 --> 59:16.184
- Unfortunately not.
At least not from this planet.

59:16.186 --> 59:17.819
- Not from this planet?

59:19.156 --> 59:20.889
Do you mean to say that...

59:20.891 --> 59:23.025
- If it is within our means
to locate the intruder,

59:23.027 --> 59:25.060
we will find him.

59:25.061 --> 59:27.094
And retaliate according
to our defense protocols.

59:28.332 --> 59:30.966
- Before I initiate
any protocols,

59:31.669 --> 59:33.268
I'll need evidence.

59:33.270 --> 59:37.005
Rock-solid, consistent,
indisputable facts.

59:37.007 --> 59:39.107
- We'll get the facts.
But first...

59:41.211 --> 59:43.045
We must disarm them.

59:43.047 --> 59:44.279
No more cell phones.

59:44.615 --> 59:46.281
No digital technology.

59:46.283 --> 59:48.650
We have to put analog services
back in operation.

59:48.652 --> 59:51.320
We use nothing
but landline phones

59:51.322 --> 59:52.988
and couriers.

59:59.063 --> 1:00:00.829
I agree. Go ahead!

1:00:03.834 --> 1:00:04.900
ATTENTION

1:00:05.869 --> 1:00:08.136
[printing press whirring]

1:00:10.608 --> 1:00:12.207
SEALED - DO NOT OPEN

1:00:32.329 --> 1:00:34.062
- A special edition.

1:00:34.798 --> 1:00:37.799
ATTENTION! DO NOT TRUST
DIGITAL MEDIA!

1:00:37.801 --> 1:00:41.937
That's what comes of
all this high-tech crap!

1:00:49.246 --> 1:00:50.912
- Hey! Young man!

1:01:00.257 --> 1:01:02.391
- [sniffs]

1:01:05.262 --> 1:01:06.928
Impure.

1:01:13.137 --> 1:01:15.137
[sniffs]

1:01:25.315 --> 1:01:27.783
- Got a dry mouth?
- That's right.

1:01:28.018 --> 1:01:29.985
[cellphone ringing]

1:01:29.987 --> 1:01:31.253
- Yes, Mom?

1:01:31.255 --> 1:01:33.288
- Who, Misha?
Say again.

1:01:33.290 --> 1:01:35.357
- Hello?
- Who is Yulia?

1:01:35.726 --> 1:01:37.759
[all cellphones ringing

1:01:37.761 --> 1:01:38.960
- Hello.

1:01:39.730 --> 1:01:41.463
- Do you collect stickers?
- No.

1:01:41.465 --> 1:01:43.298
- Have you got our loyalty card?
- No card.

1:01:43.300 --> 1:01:45.734
- Would you like one?
- I don't want a loyalty card.

1:01:45.736 --> 1:01:47.436
- It won't take long.
- Yulia?

1:01:47.438 --> 1:01:49.471
- You can register it
via the app.

1:01:49.473 --> 1:01:51.907
- I get it.
No loyalty card.

1:01:51.909 --> 1:01:54.443
No stickers.
I want pure water.

1:01:54.445 --> 1:01:56.411
- You can go
to our website...

1:01:56.413 --> 1:01:58.080
- Enough!

1:02:01.952 --> 1:02:04.753
- Calm down.
Explain it to me again.

1:02:04.922 --> 1:02:06.955
Which Yulia?
What apartment block?

1:02:07.491 --> 1:02:09.257
- A terror attack?
Are you okay?

1:02:10.227 --> 1:02:11.927
- The incident is interesting.

1:02:11.929 --> 1:02:14.863
Yulia Lebedeva is wanted
on suspicion of extremism.

1:02:15.365 --> 1:02:18.233
- Zora, are these your friends
doing this on the screen now?

1:02:18.235 --> 1:02:20.102
- My parents said
it was up to me.

1:02:20.104 --> 1:02:21.803
I've made up my mind.

1:02:21.805 --> 1:02:24.940
I want to do cybersport.
- An excellent decision.

1:02:24.942 --> 1:02:28.477
Especially if you compare it to
studying math or physics.

1:02:28.479 --> 1:02:30.378
Cybersport is the in-thing
right now.

1:02:30.380 --> 1:02:33.315
But your top priority now
is to locate Yulia Lebedeva,

1:02:33.317 --> 1:02:35.784
who is charged with
several crimes.

1:02:37.821 --> 1:02:39.454
- Yes, it's okay.

1:02:40.224 --> 1:02:42.924
- Mom, are you calling me?
- I'm talking with your dad.

1:02:42.926 --> 1:02:45.026
Who is Yulia?
Why are you telling me?

1:02:45.229 --> 1:02:47.963
[cellphones ringing]

1:02:49.833 --> 1:02:52.234
- Yulia Lebedeva is
still on the wanted list.

1:02:52.236 --> 1:02:54.536
Any information of her
whereabouts...

1:02:57.107 --> 1:03:00.542
- Attention all units.
APB on Yulia Lebedeva.

1:03:00.544 --> 1:03:02.210
Last seen...

1:03:04.515 --> 1:03:06.948
- Why so much water?
- Water is the basis of life.

1:03:06.950 --> 1:03:08.416
- An ID is the basis of life.
Got one?

1:03:08.418 --> 1:03:09.518
- No ID.

1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:10.786
- Where are you from?

1:03:10.788 --> 1:03:12.120
- From here.
I live in Kushelevo.

1:03:12.122 --> 1:03:14.489
- What is your full address?
- My full address is

1:03:14.858 --> 1:03:18.860
Virgo Supercluster, Local Group,
the Milky Way, the Orion Arm,

1:03:18.862 --> 1:03:20.862
the Solar System,
Planet Earth,

1:03:20.864 --> 1:03:23.832
Eurasia, Russia,
Moscow Region,

1:03:23.834 --> 1:03:26.535
Kushelevo Village,
14 Srednyaya Street.

1:03:26.537 --> 1:03:28.937
I have a job, a house,
and a vegetable garden.

1:03:30.140 --> 1:03:32.474
- You can go.
Orion Arm...

1:03:38.115 --> 1:03:40.282
- Okay, and what did she do?

1:03:40.284 --> 1:03:41.283
- She blew up
an apartment block.

1:03:41.285 --> 1:03:43.185
- Oh, my God.

1:03:43.186 --> 1:03:45.086
- The whole city is up in arms.
You hear me, Lena?

1:03:45.422 --> 1:03:47.823
- I'll call you back.
Bye.

1:03:57.568 --> 1:04:00.569
- Attention all units.
Searching for a gray Volvo...

1:04:00.571 --> 1:04:04.072
- Hello. I'd like to report
Yulia Lebedeva.

1:04:04.074 --> 1:04:05.907
[engine revving]
- Come on!

1:04:08.946 --> 1:04:11.079
[police siren sounding]

1:04:14.585 --> 1:04:18.386
- Driver of the gray Volvo.
Stop the car now!

1:04:37.574 --> 1:04:39.875
[cellphone vibrating]

1:04:40.477 --> 1:04:41.977
DARLING

1:04:42.613 --> 1:04:44.613
- I can't talk now.
I'll call you back.

1:04:44.615 --> 1:04:47.182
- Roma is in the hospital!
- What?

1:04:47.584 --> 1:04:49.084
- Our building was blown up.

1:04:49.086 --> 1:04:51.219
I went out for a minute
and then...

1:04:51.221 --> 1:04:53.321
- I don't get it.
- What don't you get?

1:04:53.323 --> 1:04:55.423
- Lena, calm down.
Where are you?

1:04:55.626 --> 1:04:58.059
- Your son was almost killed.

1:04:59.997 --> 1:05:01.630
- I don't get it.
Why are you panicking?

1:05:01.632 --> 1:05:03.665
- What don't you get?
We have to find her.

1:05:03.667 --> 1:05:06.234
- Mom, is that Dad calling?

1:05:06.236 --> 1:05:08.270
- Roma, do your homework
or I'll call the cops!

1:05:08.272 --> 1:05:10.272
- Lena, listen to me.

1:05:10.274 --> 1:05:12.607
If you see her,
call me right away.

1:05:12.609 --> 1:05:15.410
- I'm listening but what have
we got to do with any of this?

1:05:15.412 --> 1:05:17.412
I thought you were
coming home earlier

1:05:17.414 --> 1:05:19.114
to spend time with Roma.

1:05:19.116 --> 1:05:20.282
He has a concussion.

1:05:20.284 --> 1:05:22.284
We're in hospital.
I'll put him on.

1:05:22.286 --> 1:05:23.685
- Hey, Dad.
- Roma!

1:05:23.687 --> 1:05:27.022
- Did you watch the news?
That's Yulia Lebedeva.

1:05:27.658 --> 1:05:30.292
She's all over the internet,
too.

1:05:30.294 --> 1:05:33.662
- Roma, what...
- She blew up our house.

1:05:33.664 --> 1:05:37.032
- Why... How are you?
- I can't talk now.

1:05:37.034 --> 1:05:38.566
The doctor is here.
I'll forward you a link.

1:05:43.407 --> 1:05:46.374
- ...partially destroyed
a housing block...

1:05:47.144 --> 1:05:49.411
We can't confirm
the death toll.

1:05:49.413 --> 1:05:52.314
It's being updated continuously,
but the numbers are growing.

1:05:52.316 --> 1:05:55.250
A hotline was established
by EMERCOM

1:05:55.252 --> 1:05:58.320
which you can call to find out
if anyone in your family is,

1:05:58.322 --> 1:06:00.655
God forbid,
one of the victims.

1:06:05.195 --> 1:06:06.728
MOSCOW - CONSTRUCTION WORK
ON LEVEDEV STEET

1:06:06.730 --> 1:06:09.097
MOSCOW IS LOOKING FOR
YULIA LEVEDEVA

1:06:09.099 --> 1:06:11.166
DO YOU KNOW YULIA LEVEDEVA?

1:06:16.673 --> 1:06:18.440
[doorbell ringing]

1:06:23.580 --> 1:06:25.213
- [exhales sharply]

1:06:26.416 --> 1:06:28.717
- Local Police Officer,
Senior Lieutenant Fillipov.

1:06:28.719 --> 1:06:30.685
- Hello.
- Hello.

1:06:31.221 --> 1:06:34.022
A classmate of yours?
- Yes.

1:06:34.024 --> 1:06:36.992
- Where and when
was the last time you saw her?

1:06:37.160 --> 1:06:39.394
- At university.
- Who's at the door?

1:06:40.330 --> 1:06:41.897
You're here!

1:06:41.898 --> 1:06:43.465
I've been waiting for you
for two years.

1:06:43.467 --> 1:06:47.035
When are you going to shut down
the disco on the ground floor?

1:06:47.037 --> 1:06:49.471
- We will look into the matter.
- Please, do.

1:06:49.473 --> 1:06:51.439
- Let me know if you hear
anything about your friend.

1:06:51.441 --> 1:06:53.575
- We will.
We certainly will.

1:06:55.312 --> 1:06:57.078
- Grandma,
what are you doing?

1:06:57.080 --> 1:06:59.481
Have a rest.
- How can I rest?

1:06:59.483 --> 1:07:02.083
Either I'm all alone, or it's
Grand Central Station here.

1:07:02.085 --> 1:07:04.019
Where did you hide
your friends?

1:07:11.495 --> 1:07:13.728
- Hello.
My name is Hariton.

1:07:38.288 --> 1:07:40.455
- So, is it helping?

1:07:44.694 --> 1:07:46.594
- Yes, she'll survive.

1:07:49.132 --> 1:07:51.332
But she is no longer
one of you.

1:07:55.372 --> 1:07:57.439
[water trickling]

1:08:04.681 --> 1:08:06.481
The pain is changing her.

1:08:08.785 --> 1:08:10.752
She's getting stronger
because of it.

1:08:13.323 --> 1:08:15.323
But the force that's growing
inside of her

1:08:15.325 --> 1:08:16.624
could become a risk
for us all.

1:08:21.198 --> 1:08:24.599
- Is that why Ra
wants to kill her?

1:08:25.202 --> 1:08:26.668
- Ra is an artificial
intelligence.

1:08:26.670 --> 1:08:28.136
It does not want anything.

1:08:28.138 --> 1:08:31.739
It analyzes event probabilities
and follows a defense protocol.

1:08:35.312 --> 1:08:36.544
- A protocol?

1:08:37.714 --> 1:08:39.414
- A mathematical one.

1:08:40.851 --> 1:08:43.418
One death is better
than multiple deaths.

1:09:03.507 --> 1:09:04.572
[bell dings]

1:09:06.376 --> 1:09:09.377
- All law enforcement agencies
continue to search

1:09:09.379 --> 1:09:10.512
for Yulia Lebedeva.

1:09:10.514 --> 1:09:12.547
Authorities are doing
their best...

1:09:12.782 --> 1:09:14.582
- What did she do?

1:09:15.519 --> 1:09:16.684
- Nothing much.

1:09:17.888 --> 1:09:19.671
- They're false accusations.

1:09:19.672 --> 1:09:21.455
- I see. Is she a political
activist?

1:09:21.458 --> 1:09:23.791
- Something like that.
- What about you?

1:09:24.261 --> 1:09:27.228
- He's not from around here.
- I have a job, a house and...

1:09:27.230 --> 1:09:30.398
- He's trying to get her out...
of the country.

1:09:30.534 --> 1:09:32.534
And I'm just helping a bit.

1:09:32.536 --> 1:09:35.236
- That'll get you eight years
in prison.

1:09:35.238 --> 1:09:37.172
We can share a cell.

1:09:37.741 --> 1:09:39.240
- Is he also...

1:09:39.242 --> 1:09:41.209
- No, he is--

1:09:41.211 --> 1:09:44.746
- I am the only one here
to suffer for no reason.

1:09:45.549 --> 1:09:47.849
Nothing but stress since then.

1:09:48.385 --> 1:09:50.285
You have anything
to whet my palate?

1:09:51.888 --> 1:09:53.488
- Let me see.

1:09:54.424 --> 1:09:56.457
- What's the deal with her?

1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:58.459
Will she rat on us?

1:09:59.763 --> 1:10:01.963
- Let's drink to our meeting.

1:10:05.802 --> 1:10:07.268
Here you are.

1:10:07.270 --> 1:10:09.337
- So, your people...

1:10:09.906 --> 1:10:13.241
Can't they just strike us
with a death ray?

1:10:13.510 --> 1:10:14.509
- You have something like that,
right?

1:10:14.511 --> 1:10:16.811
- Even you don't do that.

1:10:16.813 --> 1:10:18.913
There are more effective
methods.

1:10:18.915 --> 1:10:20.982
- We've got missiles, too.

1:10:20.984 --> 1:10:23.585
And we can strike back.
- Oh yes, we can!

1:10:23.587 --> 1:10:25.954
- That is a bad option and
could aggravate the situation.

1:10:25.956 --> 1:10:29.390
- So the idea
of annihilation is bad.

1:10:30.460 --> 1:10:33.228
But hiding for the rest
of one's life...

1:10:33.930 --> 1:10:35.396
Is a good one?

1:10:36.800 --> 1:10:40.368
- I will not do anything
that could hurt her.

1:10:41.871 --> 1:10:43.371
- Me neither.

1:10:49.713 --> 1:10:51.012
- To love!

1:10:52.415 --> 1:10:53.748
To love!

1:10:56.753 --> 1:10:58.386
- To love.

1:11:02.592 --> 1:11:04.359
[glasses clink]

1:11:13.970 --> 1:11:15.937
- How was that?
You okay?

1:11:19.376 --> 1:11:22.710
So you think
we should hide in the woods

1:11:22.712 --> 1:11:25.313
for the rest of our lives?
- We have no other choice.

1:11:25.315 --> 1:11:26.848
This stuff inhibits
your reflexes

1:11:26.850 --> 1:11:28.650
and impedes vital functions.

1:11:28.652 --> 1:11:30.818
- That's the point.

1:11:31.388 --> 1:11:32.587
So let's drink!

1:11:32.756 --> 1:11:34.455
To the intergalactic union.

1:11:34.457 --> 1:11:35.990
- Firstly, I'm from the same
galaxy.

1:11:35.992 --> 1:11:37.692
What's more,
there is no connection

1:11:37.694 --> 1:11:39.394
between drinking alcohol

1:11:39.396 --> 1:11:40.795
and the probability
of the realization

1:11:40.797 --> 1:11:42.530
of the words you just
spoke aloud.

1:11:42.532 --> 1:11:43.798
- Smartass!

1:11:44.734 --> 1:11:46.000
This is just...

1:11:47.370 --> 1:11:48.569
Tradition.

1:11:53.877 --> 1:11:55.843
[glasses clink]

1:12:00.684 --> 1:12:01.949
Now a chaser!

1:12:03.553 --> 1:12:05.787
- [gulping]

1:12:07.457 --> 1:12:09.924
[gasping]

1:12:09.926 --> 1:12:12.560
That's not vodka!
- It's even better.

1:12:16.666 --> 1:12:18.499
[thud]

1:12:25.542 --> 1:12:26.974
Let's hand him over.

1:12:28.645 --> 1:12:30.478
- To whom?
- The authorities.

1:12:32.782 --> 1:12:35.016
You have no choice.

1:12:35.685 --> 1:12:39.987
Or you will go to jail...
as an accomplice.

1:12:40.824 --> 1:12:42.590
It's either him...

1:12:43.727 --> 1:12:45.360
Or us.

1:12:46.830 --> 1:12:49.697
What planet
are you fighting for?

1:12:54.404 --> 1:12:56.571
- He's heavy.
- Make an effort.

1:12:56.573 --> 1:12:57.972
No one will believe us

1:12:57.974 --> 1:12:59.640
if we don't bring
the alien in alive.

1:13:00.577 --> 1:13:02.410
Put your hat on his head!

1:13:18.995 --> 1:13:20.561
Are you free, boss?

1:13:20.864 --> 1:13:22.063
- In a minute.

1:13:26.903 --> 1:13:29.437
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

1:13:34.010 --> 1:13:36.644
- Hi there.
- Are you guys partying?

1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:39.781
- Our friend here is going
to serve in the army.

1:13:40.483 --> 1:13:43.518
"Spade and gun
make a soldier's life fun."

1:13:44.788 --> 1:13:47.455
Where do you want to go?
- Ministry of Defense.

1:13:47.457 --> 1:13:49.090
- What branch
will he be joining?

1:13:49.893 --> 1:13:51.726
- The Aerospace Forces.

1:13:51.728 --> 1:13:53.461
- Don't shoot.

1:13:53.463 --> 1:13:54.996
It's pointless.
- Shut up.

1:13:54.998 --> 1:13:56.597
- You do, you don't.
They make you.

1:13:56.599 --> 1:13:58.065
It's not that bad.

1:13:58.635 --> 1:14:01.536
You get to know life,
breathing in gunpowder.

1:14:03.673 --> 1:14:05.072
- I am Sergei Brilyov.

1:14:05.074 --> 1:14:06.908
You are watching
Vesti breaking news.

1:14:06.910 --> 1:14:09.110
At the moment we
are broadcasting live

1:14:09.112 --> 1:14:11.646
via the EMERCOM
mobile stations.

1:14:11.648 --> 1:14:13.648
We are in the midst
of truly inexplicable acts

1:14:13.650 --> 1:14:15.717
of enemy sabotage.

1:14:15.718 --> 1:14:17.785
We don't know details yet,
but we are under attack.

1:14:17.787 --> 1:14:20.054
The enemy has taken control

1:14:20.056 --> 1:14:22.523
of all digital communication
channels.

1:14:22.525 --> 1:14:24.525
Be prudent.

1:14:24.526 --> 1:14:26.526
Trust only information that
comes directly from the police,

1:14:26.529 --> 1:14:28.930
military officials,
and/or members of EMERCOM.

1:14:28.932 --> 1:14:30.932
Avoid using modern
telecommunications

1:14:30.934 --> 1:14:32.934
when talking to family
or friends.

1:14:32.936 --> 1:14:34.536
And above all:

1:14:34.537 --> 1:14:36.137
Do not react to any
provocations.

1:14:45.648 --> 1:14:47.682
[gasps]

1:15:02.232 --> 1:15:04.699
- Where is she?
- In a safe place.

1:15:04.701 --> 1:15:06.534
I will have you shot
right here!

1:15:06.536 --> 1:15:08.936
No judge, no trial.
- She's at my place.

1:15:09.105 --> 1:15:10.771
- Google, you idiot.

1:15:13.109 --> 1:15:15.943
- What's going on
with the internet and TV?

1:15:15.945 --> 1:15:17.979
Was that your lot?
- Ra is after Yulia.

1:15:17.981 --> 1:15:20.681
It decided to kill her
in order to keep peace.

1:15:20.683 --> 1:15:23.084
- Keep peace... Nazi style.

1:15:23.086 --> 1:15:25.753
- And I am going to
destroy this Ra of yours!

1:15:25.989 --> 1:15:27.121
Where is it?

1:15:27.123 --> 1:15:28.756
Where? In orbit?

1:15:28.758 --> 1:15:29.957
- You don't stand a chance.

1:15:29.959 --> 1:15:31.259
You don't know
what it's capable of.

1:15:31.261 --> 1:15:32.494
- We didn't start this,

1:15:32.495 --> 1:15:33.728
we're following
our defense protocol.

1:15:33.997 --> 1:15:35.763
- Ra thinks the same way.

1:15:37.300 --> 1:15:38.966
- Get these two out of here.

1:15:45.108 --> 1:15:46.307
Hariton.

1:15:48.044 --> 1:15:49.210
Help me.

1:15:49.212 --> 1:15:52.880
Only you know the exact
coordinates of his location.

1:15:52.882 --> 1:15:54.549
Make your choice now.

1:15:55.985 --> 1:15:57.585
What means more to you?

1:15:58.621 --> 1:15:59.820
Your world?

1:16:02.592 --> 1:16:04.225
Or my daughter?

1:16:11.067 --> 1:16:12.967
- Please leave a message
after the tone.

1:16:27.183 --> 1:16:29.183
- Call the Barnaul
observatory.

1:16:29.185 --> 1:16:31.953
I want them to confirm
the coordinates.

1:16:31.955 --> 1:16:34.789
With special emphasis on
the satellite Jamal-410.

1:16:34.791 --> 1:16:36.891
Should be close by.
- Yes, sir!

1:16:40.663 --> 1:16:41.929
- Walk with me.

1:16:41.930 --> 1:16:43.196
- General, permission
to leave for 30 minutes.

1:16:43.199 --> 1:16:45.333
- Is that a mobile phone?
I ordered you not to use it!

1:16:45.335 --> 1:16:47.969
Pick up Yulia and bring her
to me personally.

1:16:47.971 --> 1:16:50.304
Not a word to anyone.
Here's the address.

1:16:50.306 --> 1:16:51.772
Got it?

1:16:56.179 --> 1:16:57.645
- Yes, sir!

1:16:59.248 --> 1:17:01.682
[dramatic music]
¶¶

1:17:09.959 --> 1:17:12.627
- 23 hours, 50 minutes,
38 seconds.

1:17:12.996 --> 1:17:15.046
- Take a look.

1:17:15.047 --> 1:17:17.097
- An unidentified object
was located in sector 5032.

1:17:17.100 --> 1:17:19.700
It maneuvered
and came to a halt.

1:17:19.702 --> 1:17:22.336
...came to a halt at Alpha...
- ...23 hours, 38 minutes...

1:17:31.247 --> 1:17:33.314
- 322, come in.
Over.

1:17:36.819 --> 1:17:38.786
- The Security Council
is on the phone, general.

1:17:40.857 --> 1:17:42.657
Comrade officers!

1:17:48.398 --> 1:17:50.264
- Yes, Valentin?
What's the word?

1:17:50.266 --> 1:17:52.400
- We can confirm
it's an invasion.

1:17:52.402 --> 1:17:55.236
We have the coordinates.
Do we engage the protocol?

1:17:57.974 --> 1:17:59.740
- What do you think,
comrades?

1:17:59.742 --> 1:18:00.941
- If this thing
really has the entire

1:18:00.943 --> 1:18:02.176
information network
under control,

1:18:02.178 --> 1:18:04.979
including NATO missile unit
communications,

1:18:04.981 --> 1:18:06.414
and we want to destroy it,

1:18:06.416 --> 1:18:09.417
then we have to assume
it will intercept our missiles.

1:18:09.419 --> 1:18:12.920
- Our plan is to briefly disable
the satellites it controls.

1:18:12.922 --> 1:18:14.939
- How will you do that?

1:18:14.940 --> 1:18:16.957
- Right now, all satellites
are linked together.

1:18:17.794 --> 1:18:19.293
If we take out one of them,

1:18:19.295 --> 1:18:21.295
control will be lost
for a short time.

1:18:21.297 --> 1:18:23.030
- Pardon my lack of wit,
general,

1:18:23.032 --> 1:18:24.699
but losing our military
satellites

1:18:24.701 --> 1:18:26.233
would render us defenseless.

1:18:27.203 --> 1:18:29.203
- Who said anything about
military?

1:18:43.786 --> 1:18:44.852
- This way.

1:18:49.425 --> 1:18:50.758
Hello.

1:18:50.760 --> 1:18:51.892
INTERN

1:18:51.894 --> 1:18:53.094
They're with me.

1:18:54.330 --> 1:18:56.163
- We rolled back
the entire system.

1:18:56.899 --> 1:18:59.800
And they're still getting in.
- Hello!

1:18:59.802 --> 1:19:02.169
This is a raid!
Everyone remain seated!

1:19:03.206 --> 1:19:06.073
I have good news
and bad news.

1:19:06.075 --> 1:19:08.075
The bad news is
an alien spaceship

1:19:08.077 --> 1:19:09.343
has hacked your system.

1:19:09.345 --> 1:19:12.246
No reason to be ashamed.
Shit happens.

1:19:12.248 --> 1:19:16.117
The good news is that
we are going to kick their ass!

1:19:16.119 --> 1:19:18.018
The only thing
we need to do is...

1:19:19.088 --> 1:19:20.888
Zap your satellite.

1:19:24.127 --> 1:19:26.460
- Where are you going?
I'm telling you.

1:19:26.462 --> 1:19:30.131
You can wait for them here,
they'll be back soon.

1:19:30.133 --> 1:19:31.465
- Did they take him
to the military?

1:19:31.467 --> 1:19:32.500
Ministry of Defense?

1:19:32.502 --> 1:19:34.268
- Oh lord!

1:19:35.838 --> 1:19:37.404
- Can you unlock this door,
please?

1:19:37.406 --> 1:19:39.874
- They told me
to keep you inside.

1:19:39.876 --> 1:19:42.009
- Can you please
open the door?!

1:19:43.079 --> 1:19:45.146
[doorbell ringing]

1:19:51.154 --> 1:19:52.419
- Let's go.

1:19:53.389 --> 1:19:54.789
- I'm sorry.

1:20:03.933 --> 1:20:05.266
- [chuckles]

1:20:07.537 --> 1:20:11.005
It was the only right decision
I could make.

1:20:11.007 --> 1:20:13.240
- You think you're
protecting her.

1:20:14.143 --> 1:20:16.577
But the truth is
you destroy everything

1:20:16.979 --> 1:20:19.213
that reminds you
of the mistake you made.

1:20:20.183 --> 1:20:23.918
- Did you take courses
in psychotherapy

1:20:23.920 --> 1:20:26.987
out there on Sirius?

1:20:30.560 --> 1:20:32.827
- Put me on speakerphone.
- Yes, sir.

1:20:34.997 --> 1:20:37.998
- Judging by the speed
of the space ship's signal,

1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:40.000
we'll only have
a few seconds

1:20:40.002 --> 1:20:42.069
before this Ra
restores the link.

1:20:42.872 --> 1:20:46.040
That's why we kill the satellite
when the missile is airborne.

1:20:46.042 --> 1:20:48.943
- Got it. But what can we do
in just a few seconds?

1:20:48.945 --> 1:20:50.010
- Speaker off.

1:20:50.913 --> 1:20:52.246
Take out the ship.

1:20:52.582 --> 1:20:54.014
- With what?

1:20:54.016 --> 1:20:55.382
- Echelon-2.

1:20:59.455 --> 1:21:01.288
- Comrade general,

1:21:01.290 --> 1:21:04.358
you and I both know
that we don't have that.

1:21:06.329 --> 1:21:09.530
- You and I both know
that we do have it.

1:21:10.466 --> 1:21:11.999
- You're...

1:21:13.035 --> 1:21:14.869
All so...

1:21:16.072 --> 1:21:18.038
Exemplary.

1:21:19.575 --> 1:21:21.876
Civilized.

1:21:24.213 --> 1:21:26.146
And we here...

1:21:29.352 --> 1:21:31.385
Are savages.

1:21:32.622 --> 1:21:35.289
And we can be...

1:21:36.125 --> 1:21:37.458
Killed.

1:21:38.361 --> 1:21:43.163
As long as everything
follows the protocol, right?

1:21:43.332 --> 1:21:47.301
It is due to people like you
that such a protocol exists.

1:21:50.106 --> 1:21:52.206
- That sounds plausible,
yet I'm against it.

1:21:52.208 --> 1:21:54.909
There are too many risks,
general.

1:21:55.678 --> 1:21:57.611
- You know me.

1:21:57.612 --> 1:21:59.545
Shooting is the last option
I would ever suggest.

1:22:00.149 --> 1:22:03.317
But now...
We don't have much of a choice.

1:22:17.033 --> 1:22:19.300
- I never thought
I would say this,

1:22:19.302 --> 1:22:21.435
but I am glad to see you.

1:22:22.238 --> 1:22:23.370
Really.

1:22:30.413 --> 1:22:31.645
Are you okay?

1:22:31.647 --> 1:22:34.081
- My wife and son
were in that building.

1:22:36.285 --> 1:22:39.186
- She was...

1:22:40.022 --> 1:22:42.089
Safe with me.

1:22:47.330 --> 1:22:48.629
And...

1:22:50.166 --> 1:22:52.266
If you hadn't flown here,

1:22:53.035 --> 1:22:56.036
she wouldn't be in danger.

1:22:56.038 --> 1:22:57.404
- You...

1:22:58.307 --> 1:23:00.007
You mean the explosion?

1:23:00.676 --> 1:23:02.609
You know
I had nothing to do with that.

1:23:02.611 --> 1:23:04.411
- The boy is seven years old.

1:23:05.481 --> 1:23:08.048
He's in a hospital,
but there's no connection.

1:23:08.050 --> 1:23:11.118
But if I find out
that he's doing worse,

1:23:11.554 --> 1:23:13.487
then I'll come after you.

1:23:14.557 --> 1:23:16.023
Myself.

1:23:17.426 --> 1:23:19.493
And daddy
won't be able to help you.

1:23:23.199 --> 1:23:25.699
- Sooner or later...

1:23:27.636 --> 1:23:29.370
She will be killed.

1:23:35.044 --> 1:23:36.276
Because of you.

1:23:38.647 --> 1:23:40.180

1:23:40.182 --> 1:23:41.582

1:23:52.094 --> 1:23:54.028
Congratulations.

1:23:54.797 --> 1:23:57.664
You're a real human being now,
Hariton.

1:23:58.634 --> 1:24:01.068

1:24:17.620 --> 1:24:19.153
You think I never
gave any thought

1:24:19.155 --> 1:24:20.587
about how to make up
for it all?

1:24:23.526 --> 1:24:25.325
Every single day.

1:24:30.800 --> 1:24:32.199
Every day.

to Rostelecom.

1:24:59.829 --> 1:25:02.262
- You're good to go.
Do it.

1:25:02.865 --> 1:25:04.131
- Go for it.

1:25:54.717 --> 1:25:56.517
- We did it, sir!

1:26:00.623 --> 1:26:02.456
- Lebedev?

1:26:02.457 --> 1:26:04.290
- For you, comrade general.
- Go ahead.

1:26:04.894 --> 1:26:06.627
- Good job, my friend.
Thank you.

1:26:06.629 --> 1:26:08.446
We did the right thing.

1:26:08.447 --> 1:26:10.264
- It's too early to tell.
Sorry, I can't talk now.

1:26:10.766 --> 1:26:12.900
I want a complete report
of all satellites in the area.

1:26:12.902 --> 1:26:17.271
Call the observatories and ISS.
I want a visual confirmation.

1:26:21.510 --> 1:26:23.410
- Let's go.
Both of you.

1:26:33.289 --> 1:26:35.689
- A huge crowd
has gathered in front

1:26:35.691 --> 1:26:38.358
of the National
Defense Center.

1:26:38.527 --> 1:26:40.761
They're demanding the
extradition of Yulia Lebedeva

1:26:40.763 --> 1:26:42.062
over her suspected involvement

1:26:42.063 --> 1:26:43.362
in an arson attack
of a residential building.

1:26:43.365 --> 1:26:44.898
Some suggest that
General Lebedev

1:26:44.900 --> 1:26:46.700
is covering for his daughter

1:26:46.702 --> 1:26:48.669
and that he should be
held accountable

1:26:48.671 --> 1:26:50.737
for shielding her
from criminal prosecution.

1:26:50.973 --> 1:26:53.307
- Please remain calm.

1:26:57.546 --> 1:26:59.613
- [crowd] Put her away!

1:27:01.917 --> 1:27:03.617

Put her away!

what happened to your family.

But it's not my fault,
you hear me?

1:27:15.464 --> 1:27:18.232
- Let us through!

1:27:19.301 --> 1:27:20.567
- There she is!

1:27:20.569 --> 1:27:21.602
- Ivan!

1:27:21.604 --> 1:27:25.439
I am not to blame.
I was framed. Really.

1:27:25.441 --> 1:27:26.673
- That's her!

1:27:26.809 --> 1:27:27.908

1:27:50.566 --> 1:27:52.499
Thank you for believing me.

1:27:54.737 --> 1:27:56.403
- I don't believe you.

1:28:07.383 --> 1:28:08.849
- Did you destroy it?

1:28:09.618 --> 1:28:11.952
- We destroyed it.

1:28:13.055 --> 1:28:14.554
- Thank you, Ivan.

1:28:16.025 --> 1:28:18.058
- I never thought it would
end like this.

1:28:19.862 --> 1:28:21.528
At least not with you.

1:28:28.404 --> 1:28:29.603
- She didn't do it.
You should know that.

1:28:30.039 --> 1:28:34.641
- I owe you nothing!

We can't use phones now.

1:28:43.352 --> 1:28:44.484
How are you?

1:28:46.388 --> 1:28:48.021
- Did you hear about
the terrorist attack?

1:28:48.390 --> 1:28:52.025
All because of Julia Lebedeva.
She must be totally nuts.

1:28:52.528 --> 1:28:54.461
- I am listening now.

1:28:54.930 --> 1:28:56.963
I know you survived.

1:29:03.672 --> 1:29:06.473
- [Sol] I tried to minimize
the damage.

1:29:07.576 --> 1:29:11.778
I am forced
to be more aggressive now.

1:29:12.681 --> 1:29:14.915
This is not an accurate
translation.

1:29:16.385 --> 1:29:18.885
But you don't
have to stay there.

1:29:20.589 --> 1:29:22.389
You can come back.

1:29:29.832 --> 1:29:31.765
- I will not be flying away.

1:29:34.103 --> 1:29:36.370
Your assessment
is not correct.

1:29:36.372 --> 1:29:37.838
Yes,
humans do make mistakes,

1:29:37.840 --> 1:29:40.640
because they have something
more than intelligence.

1:29:41.477 --> 1:29:44.010
They listen to a voice
inside them.

1:29:47.850 --> 1:29:49.649
Which makes them better.

1:29:52.988 --> 1:29:55.021
- {Sol] You will be
disappointed.

1:29:56.592 --> 1:30:00.394
Human beings only hear
the things they are told.

1:30:02.431 --> 1:30:03.964
I warned you.

1:30:04.900 --> 1:30:06.383
I asked you to stop,

1:30:06.384 --> 1:30:07.867
but you didn't want
to listen to me.

1:30:07.870 --> 1:30:10.537
You made me do it.

1:30:20.182 --> 1:30:22.182
I understand that the death
of a foreign people

1:30:22.184 --> 1:30:23.517
from a far-away place

1:30:23.519 --> 1:30:25.118
is not particularly
interesting.

1:30:25.754 --> 1:30:28.422
Then you should start
worrying about yourselves.

1:33:10.152 --> 1:33:12.919
- Daddy, where were you?
- Come on! Run!

1:33:12.921 --> 1:33:13.987
Let's go!

1:33:25.167 --> 1:33:26.600

Smart Home.
Water leak detected.

1:33:53.729 --> 1:33:56.796
- The dome is about
200 meters high.

1:33:56.932 --> 1:33:59.933
The object itself remains
hidden within the water.

1:33:59.935 --> 1:34:02.135
We do not yet know
how to destroy it.

1:34:02.137 --> 1:34:04.704
We could deploy the air force
and shoot through the dome.

1:34:04.706 --> 1:34:06.406
But our chances are slim.

1:34:07.209 --> 1:34:09.175
- Try it.
- Yes, sir.

1:34:09.344 --> 1:34:12.145
- Excuse me.
You need to take a look at this.

1:34:20.155 --> 1:34:24.691
- There is no communication
with the people inside the dome.

1:34:24.693 --> 1:34:26.192
Keep calm.

Everything is under control.

I have to get to her.

1:34:40.275 --> 1:34:42.108
- May I?
Thank you.

1:34:42.110 --> 1:34:43.209
Excuse me!

All missiles have been fired.
Object has not been destroyed.

1:35:05.300 --> 1:35:06.900
- EMERCOM reports
an influx of over

1:35:06.902 --> 1:35:08.401
300 cubic meters
of water per second.

1:35:08.403 --> 1:35:11.004
The water is flowing from above.
We can't explain it.

1:35:11.006 --> 1:35:13.139
- This place will be
flooded in 20 minutes.

1:35:15.143 --> 1:35:17.043
- We have a chopper
on the roof.

1:35:17.045 --> 1:35:19.245
Grab Yulia
and get the hell out of here.

1:35:21.049 --> 1:35:22.282
- What about you?

1:35:23.185 --> 1:35:24.984
- I'll catch up.
- Dad...

1:35:26.154 --> 1:35:27.220
Dad!

1:35:28.056 --> 1:35:29.606
Dad!

1:35:29.607 --> 1:35:31.157

If flotation devices
are available,

1:35:47.943 --> 1:35:49.409
have them at the ready.

1:35:50.045 --> 1:35:52.278
Do not stay indoors.

1:35:54.082 --> 1:35:56.182
We were unable to
penetrate the dome,

1:35:56.184 --> 1:35:58.118
but that does not mean
we are giving up.

1:35:58.120 --> 1:36:01.020
- If the influx of water
continues at it's current pace,

1:36:01.223 --> 1:36:03.423
the upper and lower
levels of water

1:36:03.425 --> 1:36:05.892
will merge 30 meters
above ground.

1:36:08.096 --> 1:36:09.095
- We are cut off
from the outside world.

1:36:09.097 --> 1:36:11.531
- Uncle Kolya, out of the way!

1:36:11.533 --> 1:36:13.800
- If you can hear this,

1:36:13.802 --> 1:36:16.936
please approach the nearest
EMERCOM member,

1:36:16.938 --> 1:36:18.505
national guardsman
or police officer

1:36:18.507 --> 1:36:22.876
for instructions on evacuation.

1:36:24.212 --> 1:36:25.979
If you are unable to do so,

1:36:25.981 --> 1:36:27.313
please make your way
to any building

1:36:27.315 --> 1:36:28.481
nine stories or taller.

1:36:29.151 --> 1:36:31.384
[people clamoring]

1:36:33.355 --> 1:36:35.288
- To the roof!
Now!

1:36:35.991 --> 1:36:37.290
Hurry!

1:36:39.828 --> 1:36:41.961
- We are doing all we can.

1:36:41.963 --> 1:36:45.031
But without your help we will
be unable to rescue everyone.

1:36:45.433 --> 1:36:47.333
Please assist your neighbors.

1:36:48.837 --> 1:36:50.937
I know I don't
have to tell you that.

1:36:51.273 --> 1:36:53.273
[thunder rumbling]

1:37:00.148 --> 1:37:03.082

¶¶

1:37:25.006 --> 1:37:27.373
- Do not panic.

1:37:27.943 --> 1:37:29.609
Leave no one behind.

1:37:31.213 --> 1:37:33.012
Every life counts.

1:37:33.548 --> 1:37:35.114
We are humans.

1:37:36.184 --> 1:37:39.152
And we must try to save
each other while we can.

1:37:40.355 --> 1:37:42.088
- Excuse me,
I know how to destroy it.

1:37:42.090 --> 1:37:43.923
- I told you,
the chopper is waiting!

1:37:43.925 --> 1:37:45.258
- Where is my capsule?

1:37:46.928 --> 1:37:48.895
I want to utilize
an upward flowing current.

1:37:48.897 --> 1:37:50.496
The capsule will
circle around,

1:37:50.498 --> 1:37:51.848
and with a bit of luck

1:37:51.849 --> 1:37:53.199
it will be tossed up
against the spacecraft.

1:37:53.201 --> 1:37:55.902
If the impact is strong enough,
it could destroy it.

1:37:56.171 --> 1:37:58.171
- In other words
a one-way ticket?

1:37:58.173 --> 1:37:59.105
- Yes.

1:38:00.375 --> 1:38:03.276
- Tell me how you
start this thing.

1:38:04.579 --> 1:38:06.112
If it works,

1:38:06.581 --> 1:38:08.448
then tell Yulia
I love her.

1:38:09.117 --> 1:38:10.750
Not too often I said that.

1:38:10.751 --> 1:38:12.384
- You'll have to tell her
yourself.

1:38:12.387 --> 1:38:14.554
Only I can control
the capsule.

1:38:17.359 --> 1:38:20.360
Ra will not detect it
if I use the manual mode.

1:38:20.362 --> 1:38:22.362
I'll need your help
with navigation.

1:38:22.364 --> 1:38:24.264
Can you help me
stay on course?

1:38:30.138 --> 1:38:32.005
- Comrade officers,
I ordered you all

1:38:32.007 --> 1:38:34.107
to vacate the premises!

1:38:34.108 --> 1:38:36.208
Emergency evacuation!
- And what about you, sir?

1:38:36.211 --> 1:38:38.544
- Do I have to tell you again,
colonel?

1:38:38.947 --> 1:38:41.014
Get out of here
and close the door!

1:38:41.016 --> 1:38:42.582
Better yet, seal it off!

1:38:43.118 --> 1:38:45.184
[alarm sounding]

1:38:50.458 --> 1:38:52.525
[water swooshing]

1:39:11.146 --> 1:39:12.979
Do you read me, Hariton?

1:39:13.148 --> 1:39:15.081
Move ten degrees
to the right.

1:39:16.384 --> 1:39:17.617
- Got it!

1:39:28.596 --> 1:39:31.597
- Attention all units,
maintain proximity to the dome.

1:39:31.599 --> 1:39:33.299
123. Location
Sadovo-Karetnaya Street.

1:39:33.301 --> 1:39:35.034
Water is five meters high.

1:39:35.036 --> 1:39:37.670
I can't see any further.
But the water level is rising.

1:39:37.672 --> 1:39:39.305
- 127. There are seven or
eight people on the roof

1:39:39.307 --> 1:39:40.406
of the Circus Building.

1:39:40.408 --> 1:39:41.808
They have to be picked up.

1:39:41.809 --> 1:39:43.209
In ten minutes they'll be
swimming.

1:39:43.211 --> 1:39:44.978
It's the same
at Petrovka Street.

1:39:44.980 --> 1:39:46.412
Can you rescue them?

1:39:47.315 --> 1:39:49.449
- 129. Roger that.
Flying to Petrovka now.

1:39:49.451 --> 1:39:52.385
I'll land on the roof
of the police department.

1:39:53.321 --> 1:39:55.722
- 129. Has anyone spotted
a flash of light?

1:39:55.724 --> 1:39:57.757
- 123. Not yet.

1:39:57.759 --> 1:40:00.593
- 129. Fuel is running low.
I have about 15 minutes left.

1:40:00.595 --> 1:40:02.595
Tried to lift a group
off the hotel roof,

1:40:02.597 --> 1:40:04.731
but I was too close
to the dome.

1:40:04.733 --> 1:40:06.699
Any smaller choppers
out there?

1:40:06.701 --> 1:40:08.601
- I'll tell EMERCOM
to send boats there.

1:40:08.603 --> 1:40:10.636
- 127. Water is closing in.

1:40:10.638 --> 1:40:12.038
I have maybe two minutes,

1:40:12.039 --> 1:40:13.439
then I'll have to land
somewhere.

1:40:13.742 --> 1:40:15.508
- Remain airborne
for as long as you can.

1:40:15.510 --> 1:40:17.610
- We are!
What else can we do?

1:40:17.612 --> 1:40:19.645
Come on, men!
Godspeed!

1:40:20.315 --> 1:40:23.383
- 127. Permission to land
on Sandunovskiy Boulevard.

1:40:23.385 --> 1:40:26.686
My wife is over there.
- Permission granted, 127.

1:41:23.144 --> 1:41:24.577
- 123. Just flew over
the Garden Ring.

1:41:24.579 --> 1:41:26.362
Not a dry spot in sight.

1:41:26.363 --> 1:41:28.146
Fuel is depleted.
There's a building ahead.

1:41:28.149 --> 1:41:30.149
I'm going for it.
Losing altitude.

1:41:30.151 --> 1:41:33.619
- 326. The water level has
almost reached our altitude.

1:41:34.322 --> 1:41:36.222
- Easy!
Look out for the cables!

1:41:36.724 --> 1:41:38.591
- Damn it!
We're coming down!

1:41:38.593 --> 1:41:40.109
- Hold on!

1:41:40.110 --> 1:41:41.626
- I've lost control!
- [Yulia] Artyom!

1:41:43.398 --> 1:41:45.231
- Yulia! Jump!

1:41:45.867 --> 1:41:47.366
[Yulia screaming]

1:41:58.446 --> 1:42:00.680
Yulia!

1:42:02.383 --> 1:42:03.883
[Yulia gasping]

1:42:03.885 --> 1:42:05.651
Swim to the roof!

1:42:06.721 --> 1:42:08.254
- I can see four people
on the roof

1:42:08.256 --> 1:42:09.622
of a building
on Suchovka Street.

1:42:09.624 --> 1:42:11.457
How many available seats
have you got?

1:42:11.459 --> 1:42:14.127
- 605, we've got seven more
seats. We'll pick them up.

1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:28.407
[people screaming]

1:42:29.477 --> 1:42:31.477
- The water is dragging me down,
Artyom!

1:42:31.479 --> 1:42:32.812
I can't stay afloat!

1:42:35.450 --> 1:42:37.617
- Give me your hand!

1:42:37.619 --> 1:42:39.152
There you go!

1:42:41.523 --> 1:42:42.588
Are you okay?

1:42:48.496 --> 1:42:50.513
- Come on!

1:42:50.514 --> 1:42:52.531
- The water level has risen
to at least nine stories high.

1:42:59.774 --> 1:43:01.807
- Come on, come on.
Further right.

1:43:02.410 --> 1:43:04.877
You should reach the wall
in about a kilometer.

1:43:05.380 --> 1:43:07.213
I wish you the best of luck.

1:43:07.949 --> 1:43:10.316
- My chances are slim,
but I will try my best.

1:43:10.618 --> 1:43:11.684
Did you evacuate?

1:43:15.790 --> 1:43:17.190
- Sure did.

1:43:18.526 --> 1:43:20.259
- You are probably lying.

1:43:20.261 --> 1:43:22.295
Considering the high probability
of your death,

1:43:22.297 --> 1:43:24.330
I should make something clear.

1:43:25.934 --> 1:43:28.768
Would you mind if
Yulia and I live together?

1:43:30.238 --> 1:43:32.572
- Your timing is perfect,
Hariton.

1:43:33.374 --> 1:43:34.640
If you're worried
about our future,

1:43:34.642 --> 1:43:36.709
then I need to
inform you that...

1:43:36.710 --> 1:43:38.777
- I know. You have a job,
a house, and a vegetable garden.

1:43:41.549 --> 1:43:44.550
Considering that your death
is also highly probable...

1:43:44.552 --> 1:43:46.485
I grant you permission.

1:43:46.688 --> 1:43:49.755
Careful! A little to the left
or you'll hit a tower.

1:43:54.596 --> 1:43:56.262

1:44:11.980 --> 1:44:13.246
- Yulia!

1:44:13.715 --> 1:44:16.282
Put this on!
- It's me.

1:44:17.318 --> 1:44:20.519
He wants me dead.
- Yulia! Forget about that!

1:44:21.689 --> 1:44:23.556
Yulia! Calm down!
- Get away from me!

1:44:23.558 --> 1:44:25.958
Have you all decided that
this is what's best for me?

1:44:26.594 --> 1:44:28.694
Surviving at any cost?

1:44:28.696 --> 1:44:30.763
Do you think
that's all I want?

1:44:32.333 --> 1:44:35.635
Who gave you the right
to decide for me?

1:44:36.337 --> 1:44:39.005
Who gave you the right
to decide?

1:44:39.007 --> 1:44:41.841
Who gave you the right?
- No, don't do it!

1:44:43.378 --> 1:44:44.710
- Here I am!

1:44:45.480 --> 1:44:47.647
- Yulia, don't even
think about it!

1:44:49.484 --> 1:44:52.318
- This is all because of me!
- Don't do it!

1:44:52.320 --> 1:44:55.388
- That's Lebedeva!
- You have to kill me!

1:44:55.390 --> 1:44:58.024
If you kill me, then all of
this will come to an end.

1:44:58.026 --> 1:45:00.760
What are you waiting for?
People are drowning!

1:45:00.762 --> 1:45:03.629
Kill me and this will be over
and that thing will fly away.

1:45:03.631 --> 1:45:05.331
- [Sol] Kill her!

1:45:07.035 --> 1:45:08.952
- You can't do that!

1:45:08.953 --> 1:45:10.870
- Kill me and all of this
will come to an end!

1:45:11.306 --> 1:45:13.372
[people screaming]

1:45:22.050 --> 1:45:23.582
- How much time?

1:45:24.385 --> 1:45:25.584
- Say again?

1:45:25.787 --> 1:45:27.720
- Till the waves close in.

1:45:27.955 --> 1:45:30.389
[distant rumbling]

1:45:31.659 --> 1:45:33.626
How much time do we have?

1:45:44.706 --> 1:45:46.339
- Do it, Hariton.

1:45:47.508 --> 1:45:49.342
I can't help you any longer.

1:45:56.351 --> 1:45:59.018
