01:52.212 --> 01:53.421
You're special.

01:54.798 --> 01:58.593
<i>You have a very special purpose in life.</i>

02:00.804 --> 02:02.138
You've been chosen.

02:13.692 --> 02:16.027
The Island awaits you.

03:06.995 --> 03:08.955
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

03:37.275 --> 03:39.152
<i>Good morning, Tower One.</i>

03:39.319 --> 03:42.655
<i>Exterior contamination index
is 85 percent.</i>

03:42.822 --> 03:44.240
<i>Sunny and mild.</i>

03:55.585 --> 03:57.420
Hey, I'm missing a left shoe.

04:01.383 --> 04:04.844
<i>And when you get a chance,
I'd like another color.</i>

04:14.896 --> 04:17.357
- Morning.
- Morning.

04:25.365 --> 04:28.535
- Hey, Lincoln. How you doing?
- I'm missing a shoe.

04:39.045 --> 04:42.298
- Hey, you're cutting.
- Yeah.

04:42.841 --> 04:44.801
Thank you.

04:45.677 --> 04:47.512
We're full.

04:50.723 --> 04:54.727
<i>Good morning. July 19, 2019.</i>

04:54.894 --> 04:56.604
Another day in paradise.

05:10.618 --> 05:14.163
<i>Starkweather Two Delta,
your time has come.</i>

05:14.706 --> 05:17.542
<i>You're moving out to The Island.</i>

05:17.709 --> 05:19.294
<i>Starkweather Two Delta here.</i>

05:19.460 --> 05:22.964
<i>And as you know, the biggest dream
of my life just came true.</i>

05:23.131 --> 05:27.886
<i>I mean, I've only been with you guys for,
like, six months, but I won the lottery.</i>

05:28.052 --> 05:30.054
<i>- That's right, me.
- Six months.</i>

05:30.263 --> 05:34.642
<i>To go out and breathe fresh air.
Swim in the ocean.</i>

05:34.809 --> 05:38.813
<i>I can't believe I won.
You call me Mr. Popular, I know.</i>

05:38.980 --> 05:41.774
<i>It's me. It's me.</i>

05:41.941 --> 05:45.028
<i>You guys know I'm not like this,
but this is just amazing.</i>

05:47.238 --> 05:50.366
<i>I'm going to The Island!
We're gonna have so much fun!</i>

05:50.533 --> 05:53.828
<i>But I need to see you guys out there.
You can do it. I won!</i>

05:53.995 --> 05:55.371
<i>That was this week's winner...</i>

05:55.538 --> 05:57.915
We got a disturbance on elevator 12,
plaza level.

05:58.124 --> 06:01.711
<i>- Just moments before his final
departure to The Island...</i>

06:02.211 --> 06:04.839
<i>... nature's last remaining
pathogen-free zone.</i>

06:05.214 --> 06:07.383
Lucky guy, huh? Don't you think?

06:07.550 --> 06:11.179
<i>The next lottery is tonight.</i>

06:11.804 --> 06:15.391
"The next lottery is tonight."

06:17.727 --> 06:20.396
- How long have you been here?
- Two years.

06:21.814 --> 06:24.067
- What about you?
- Three.

06:24.275 --> 06:26.361
Three. I've been here seven.

06:26.527 --> 06:30.448
If I do the math, that makes me
the biggest lottery loser in the room.

06:32.367 --> 06:34.535
I'm such a loser.

07:04.774 --> 07:06.692
Sir.

07:07.110 --> 07:08.903
Yeah, you.

07:11.155 --> 07:12.490
Swipe.

07:14.158 --> 07:17.537
Gandu Three Echo. You've been flagged
for public disturbance before.

07:17.954 --> 07:20.623
Yes, I had a very small
emotional outburst, sir.

07:20.790 --> 07:24.085
- Safe to say it's over?
- Yes, very safe.

07:24.377 --> 07:25.878
I'm feeling much better.

07:26.087 --> 07:27.880
- Then have a pleasant day.
- You too.

07:28.089 --> 07:30.967
You both have a pleasant day too.

07:53.364 --> 07:54.657
Stretch.

07:56.576 --> 07:57.743
One more breath in.

08:18.806 --> 08:20.391
- Listen.
- I tried to do better.

08:21.684 --> 08:26.397
<i>Remember, be polite,
pleasant and peaceful.</i>

08:26.606 --> 08:29.942
<i>A healthy person is a happy person.</i>

08:37.158 --> 08:40.912
Lincoln Six Echo, choices are fruit,
oatmeal and any type of bran.

08:41.578 --> 08:43.121
No bacon today?

08:43.289 --> 08:45.333
You got a nutrition flag.
Means no bacon.

08:45.499 --> 08:49.045
Then I'll have two eggs, over easy,
not too runny, and a side of sausages.

08:49.211 --> 08:51.714
Maybe some French toast
and a little powdered sugar.

08:52.673 --> 08:56.010
You ain't cute and I got no time
for your lip, Six Echo.

08:56.636 --> 08:59.430
- Now, what's it gonna be?
- Move it.

09:02.683 --> 09:04.727
Surprise me.

09:09.398 --> 09:11.484
Surprise.

09:12.151 --> 09:14.612
Yummy. Next.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.168
Watch and learn.

09:30.878 --> 09:32.213
Next.

09:32.380 --> 09:34.298
Jordan Two Delta.

09:34.465 --> 09:36.300
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

09:36.467 --> 09:39.970
Choices are powdered eggs,
dried fruit and yogurt.

09:40.137 --> 09:42.807
- Eggs, please.
- Okay.

09:44.308 --> 09:46.977
So where were you the other day?
We missed you.

09:47.770 --> 09:50.690
That's nice of you to say, sweetheart.

09:51.565 --> 09:53.025
Get you anything else?

09:53.943 --> 09:55.319
Maybe a little bacon.

09:56.070 --> 09:59.115
- No, it says I shouldn't.
- Go ahead.

09:59.657 --> 10:01.784
Four... Five pieces, please.

10:03.536 --> 10:04.745
Thank you.

10:12.086 --> 10:14.797
- I softened her up for you.
- No doubt.

10:14.964 --> 10:16.382
Back on your diet, huh?

10:16.590 --> 10:17.925
You kidding? I love this.

10:18.134 --> 10:20.636
Better eat up.
You'll need your strength tonight.

10:20.803 --> 10:24.181
- Is that a challenge?
- I promise I'll go easy on you.

10:26.767 --> 10:30.020
Please separate. Find your seats now.

10:32.982 --> 10:35.443
"'Who wants Sally?' said Dick.

10:35.609 --> 10:37.820
'I do,' said Jane.

10:37.987 --> 10:40.739
'I cannot find Sally.

10:40.906 --> 10:45.327
Get up, Dick.
Get up and help me find Sally.'

10:46.120 --> 10:47.955
'Is Sally here?'"

11:00.593 --> 11:02.928
Dr. Merrick will see you now.

11:07.725 --> 11:10.728
What did you do wrong this time,
tough guy?

11:14.190 --> 11:15.858
Sir?

11:16.192 --> 11:17.860
You wanted to see me?

11:18.027 --> 11:20.821
Yes. Please.

11:29.413 --> 11:30.998
Please sit down.

11:32.499 --> 11:34.877
So how is Lincoln Six Echo today?

11:35.044 --> 11:37.213
Not so good, I guess.

11:37.838 --> 11:39.673
Why do you say that?

11:39.840 --> 11:42.468
Well, if I'm here,
it means I'm not so good.

11:42.843 --> 11:45.679
That's a rather negative association.

11:45.930 --> 11:50.059
My only job is to see that you're happy,
that things are okay with you.

11:50.309 --> 11:51.685
Right.

11:55.189 --> 11:57.942
Your file shows that you've been
interacting regularly...

11:58.108 --> 11:59.443
...with Jordan Two Delta.

11:59.777 --> 12:01.528
There's no law against friendship.

12:01.695 --> 12:07.910
No, we encourage it, but obviously,
proximity could become a concern.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.912
I know the rules of proximity.

12:12.373 --> 12:15.084
You've been doing quite well
in most other areas.

12:15.250 --> 12:18.045
Proficient at work,
exercising rigorously.

12:18.212 --> 12:21.674
But screening has picked up
some trace levels...

12:21.882 --> 12:25.844
...changes in your metabolism,
and you've been having nightmares.

12:26.387 --> 12:28.722
Are you saying there's something
wrong with me?

12:29.264 --> 12:31.600
Why don't you tell me
about your dream.

12:32.393 --> 12:36.563
Well, it's the same dream every time.
I'm on a boat, headed to The Island.

12:36.730 --> 12:39.817
A boat? What kind of boat?

12:41.360 --> 12:42.695
A nice boat.

12:42.945 --> 12:44.321
Draw it for me, would you?

12:49.952 --> 12:53.497
So you're heading toward The Island.

12:53.664 --> 12:55.416
What happens then?

12:55.582 --> 12:56.959
I drown.

12:57.209 --> 12:58.794
Really?

12:59.378 --> 13:00.796
Why do you think that is?

13:00.963 --> 13:02.798
I don't know. You tell me.

13:02.965 --> 13:05.509
- Are you afraid of winning?
- Why would I be afraid of winning?

13:05.676 --> 13:07.302
You tell me.

13:12.307 --> 13:14.768
What's troubling you, Lincoln?

13:16.979 --> 13:18.647
Well, it's...

13:18.897 --> 13:20.691
It's just...

13:21.817 --> 13:24.153
All right. Tuesday night is tofu night...

13:24.319 --> 13:28.031
...and I'm asking myself, "Who decided
that everyone here likes tofu?"

13:28.198 --> 13:29.908
And what is tofu, anyway?

13:30.576 --> 13:31.952
And why can't I have bacon?

13:32.119 --> 13:35.456
I line up every morning and I'm not
allowed bacon for my breakfast.

13:36.290 --> 13:38.709
And tell me...
Let's talk about all the white.

13:38.876 --> 13:40.711
Why is everyone
always wearing white?

13:40.919 --> 13:42.379
It's impossible to keep clean.

13:42.546 --> 13:45.507
I always get the gray stripe.
I never get any color.

13:45.716 --> 13:48.802
And I hand it in to be cleaned,
and someone cleans it...

13:48.969 --> 13:51.346
...and folds it neatly back in my drawer,
but who?

13:51.555 --> 13:53.807
Who is that person? I don't know.

13:54.558 --> 13:58.979
I just... I wanna know answers,
and I wish that there was more.

14:00.397 --> 14:01.857
More?

14:02.024 --> 14:06.278
Yeah. More than just waiting
to go to The Island.

14:09.364 --> 14:10.949
Lincoln...

14:11.867 --> 14:14.786
...it's your nature to question things.

14:14.953 --> 14:17.664
But don't you realize
how lucky you are?

14:17.873 --> 14:19.625
That you survived the contamination.

14:19.791 --> 14:23.712
That nature has left you
a Garden of Eden to repopulate.

14:23.879 --> 14:26.924
That, Lincoln, is your purpose.

14:31.178 --> 14:35.015
Right. And you?
Aren't you going to The Island too?

14:35.557 --> 14:37.142
No.

14:37.684 --> 14:43.023
My responsibility is to make sure
this facility continues to operate.

14:43.190 --> 14:48.528
That's why people like me,
my staff and supervisors, we...

14:49.071 --> 14:51.114
We can't win the lottery.

14:54.534 --> 14:56.662
Let me see that.

14:58.705 --> 15:00.415
You draw well.

15:00.582 --> 15:01.875
<i>"Renovatio."</i>

15:02.084 --> 15:05.545
- What does that mean?
- I don't know. It's always in my dream.

15:08.257 --> 15:10.342
I'd like to run some tests
on you, Lincoln.

15:11.426 --> 15:15.514
- What sort of tests?
- Nice tests.

15:16.264 --> 15:17.474
Come with me.

15:24.856 --> 15:26.483
Take a seat.

15:31.571 --> 15:34.950
Okay, let's get you comfortable.
Swing back.

15:39.955 --> 15:43.333
- I thought these were nice tests.
- It's a synaptic brain scan.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.419
Totally harmless.

15:45.836 --> 15:48.422
Don't worry, it's painless.

16:09.568 --> 16:11.027
- It hurts.
- Not really.

16:11.236 --> 16:12.821
- Yeah, it does!
- No, it doesn't.

16:13.029 --> 16:15.282
Yeah, it really, really does!

16:20.620 --> 16:23.540
The microsensors will move along
your optic nerve.

16:24.124 --> 16:27.169
They'll be uploading readings to us
over the next 24 hours...

16:27.335 --> 16:29.880
...after which you'll pass them
through your urine.

16:30.046 --> 16:32.257
Now, that might hurt.

16:43.351 --> 16:45.061
Six Echo, you're late.

17:00.327 --> 17:02.787
- Jones, you ever get bored doing this?
- Doing what?

17:02.954 --> 17:04.915
- This.
- I never really thought about it.

17:05.080 --> 17:06.790
- I think about it a lot.
- About what?

17:07.000 --> 17:09.711
This boring job.
What are we doing here, anyway?

17:09.877 --> 17:11.630
We're feeding the nutrient lines.

17:11.796 --> 17:14.465
We eat food,
food's gotta have vitamins, right?

17:14.633 --> 17:17.886
- It's good for us.
- You don't ever wonder about anything?

17:18.094 --> 17:20.430
Where do these tubes go?

17:22.307 --> 17:26.228
They start there.
And they go... right there.

17:27.646 --> 17:30.232
Hey, did you get a look
at the new guy?

17:30.565 --> 17:32.567
Seven Foxtrot.

17:32.734 --> 17:34.319
They found another survivor.

17:34.819 --> 17:37.989
- They keep finding them.
- He'll probably win the lottery tomorrow.

17:38.156 --> 17:40.200
Straight down, in the hole.

17:40.367 --> 17:42.494
There you go, you try it.
Straight down.

17:42.661 --> 17:44.871
- In...
- In the hole.

17:45.038 --> 17:48.875
In the hole. No, no. No. No.
Put it down.

17:49.042 --> 17:52.003
Did we look that stupid when
we went through decontamination?

17:52.212 --> 17:56.675
Hey, Mr. Man-With-All-the-Questions,
let me ask you this.

17:58.051 --> 18:00.845
- Lottery's supposed to be random, right?
- Right.

18:01.179 --> 18:04.140
What if it's not? What if it's rigged?

18:04.307 --> 18:05.892
Rigged?

18:06.851 --> 18:08.728
I've been working on this. Here.

18:09.312 --> 18:10.772
Take a look at that.

18:11.815 --> 18:14.651
It charts the last 20 people
that won a spot on The Island.

18:14.818 --> 18:17.988
Excluding, of course, the women,
picked to be breeders.

18:18.154 --> 18:20.865
- What is this?
- I took the first letter in each name.

18:21.283 --> 18:24.244
I assigned it a point value
based on its alphabet position.

18:24.411 --> 18:26.579
Like the last, Starkweather,
S equals 15.

18:26.788 --> 18:30.041
Q equals 15, S equals 19.
Do you see what I'm saying?

18:30.208 --> 18:32.210
- No.
- Maybe if you would listen to me.

18:32.377 --> 18:34.087
I'm trying to tell you.

18:34.254 --> 18:37.215
You string the numbers together.
You divide it by the amount...

18:37.382 --> 18:41.011
You multiply it by the amount...
You divide it by the amount of peop...

18:41.219 --> 18:43.013
Divide by the amount
of people here.

18:43.221 --> 18:46.766
Which is 25... A thousand plus 5... 2500.
You know what that spells?

18:47.475 --> 18:49.394
J-O-N-E-S.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.064
- I'm winning the lottery tonight.
- Did you pack?

18:54.691 --> 18:56.026
- No.
- Gentlemen...

18:57.277 --> 18:59.571
...I'm gonna go mess with Foxtrot.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.823
There you go. Straight...

19:01.990 --> 19:05.160
Straight down, in the hole.
There you go.

19:08.621 --> 19:10.206
- He had something on his...
- Go.

19:15.712 --> 19:17.338
Lima! Are you okay?

19:17.505 --> 19:21.009
Code 15! We need med-techs
down here, stat! Lima One Alpha.

19:21.176 --> 19:22.844
Just give her some air, okay?

19:23.136 --> 19:25.555
You're gonna be okay.
Just relax and breathe.

19:25.764 --> 19:29.476
Can I get a wheelchair down here,
please? It's for Lima One Alpha.

19:30.143 --> 19:31.853
I think it's time.

19:34.189 --> 19:37.358
Lima. You're going to The Island.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.403
- We're going.
- Oh, you're so lucky.

19:40.612 --> 19:42.363
I hope I see you soon.

19:45.158 --> 19:46.743
Everyone, please follow her out.

19:46.951 --> 19:49.704
Quickly and carefully.
Watch the glass.

19:50.121 --> 19:52.415
- Good luck, Lima.
- Thank you.

19:56.544 --> 19:58.922
That's fair. That's real fair.

19:59.297 --> 20:02.425
Ladies, push back, please.
Gentlemen, thank you.

20:06.346 --> 20:08.556
Everyone, back to work.

20:08.890 --> 20:11.100
That is so not fair!

20:11.559 --> 20:15.480
Oh, man, I hate this jealousy thing.
It's giving me heart palpitations.

20:15.647 --> 20:17.440
Tech Services.

20:17.899 --> 20:19.484
Computer's down again.

20:20.610 --> 20:22.529
I'm down.
Computer guy's in Sector Six.

20:22.695 --> 20:24.948
I have to deal with this mess.
Take my Tri-key.

20:25.114 --> 20:28.034
- Contamination kit. Hurry back.
- Absolutely.

20:57.021 --> 20:59.691
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm gonna see this guy.

21:01.067 --> 21:04.737
Hey, we've got live wires
all over the place here.

21:04.946 --> 21:08.157
Hey, I've been looking all over for you.

21:08.825 --> 21:10.493
- What?
- I've been looking all over...

21:10.660 --> 21:13.288
- Can't hear you.
- I've been looking all over for you.

21:13.746 --> 21:17.750
If you go and get yourself contaminated,
don't come pointing the finger at me.

21:17.959 --> 21:20.670
- How you doing, Mac?
- What are you doing here?

21:21.045 --> 21:22.380
My chip fried again.

21:23.006 --> 21:26.592
Yeah, your chip fried. How much longer
you think that one's gonna work?

21:27.844 --> 21:29.470
What are you clowns looking at?

21:29.679 --> 21:32.890
Hey, got any of that stuff
on you today?

21:33.766 --> 21:36.352
Oh, look, it's break time. Come on.

21:38.146 --> 21:40.606
You're a bad influence on me.

21:41.190 --> 21:43.651
Must be why I like you so much.

21:47.655 --> 21:51.159
What's it like where you live?
In Sector Five?

21:52.118 --> 21:55.872
Well, it's fine. You know,
it's like any other sector, I guess.

21:59.333 --> 22:01.794
I like coming out here, talking.

22:02.795 --> 22:04.839
Most supervisors don't like to talk.

22:05.048 --> 22:06.632
Yeah.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.927
Step into my office.

22:16.184 --> 22:19.020
- Are these your friends?
- Yeah, sometimes.

22:19.228 --> 22:21.022
Where are their clothes?

22:21.230 --> 22:22.899
Hey, what's with Dr. Merrick?

22:23.066 --> 22:27.278
You mean, why does he act like he's got
a filing cabinet shoved up his ass?

22:27.445 --> 22:31.240
- Yeah.
- It's called a "God complex."

22:31.407 --> 22:33.785
Doctors are like that.
Think they know everything.

22:33.993 --> 22:35.745
What's God?

22:37.080 --> 22:40.958
You know when you want something
really bad and you wish for it?

22:41.125 --> 22:42.919
God's the guy that ignores you.

22:43.753 --> 22:45.213
Oh, right.

22:45.588 --> 22:48.007
<i>Tech service requested
in Product Extraction.</i>

22:48.174 --> 22:50.218
Yeah, I'll be right there.

22:53.805 --> 22:56.182
Oh, hey, let me get that.

22:57.058 --> 22:59.477
Where do you get that stuff, anyway?

23:00.102 --> 23:02.438
It's an old stash.
You know, from before.

23:02.605 --> 23:04.565
You mean from before
the contamination?

23:04.732 --> 23:07.902
Yeah. Come on,
you're killing me with questions here.

23:08.110 --> 23:09.946
You got a sweet deal here, you know?

23:10.112 --> 23:13.241
Because you're, you know,
like, special.

23:13.449 --> 23:15.117
Why? Why am I special?

23:15.785 --> 23:17.578
There's another question.

23:18.538 --> 23:22.291
You remember what we talked about?
You don't tell anybody about our conversations?

23:22.458 --> 23:24.126
- No.
- That'll get me in big trouble.

23:24.293 --> 23:25.711
No, I don't.

23:26.128 --> 23:28.005
Good.

24:09.422 --> 24:12.216
Hey, how are you?
How's your world?

24:13.342 --> 24:15.052
Okay, I'll catch you later.

24:19.265 --> 24:21.309
Chinese junk locked up again, huh?

24:21.475 --> 24:22.893
Yep.

24:23.060 --> 24:25.062
What a surprise.

24:27.607 --> 24:29.400
Go hot.

24:33.112 --> 24:36.240
- You better fix that thing.
- Yeah.

24:36.949 --> 24:41.245
You'd think with all the money this place 
is raking in, they could afford decent equipment.

24:41.454 --> 24:43.289
Yeah. Ready?

24:46.459 --> 24:48.336
Cut the O2.

24:49.754 --> 24:53.424
Seriously, unless you wanna see me
blow chunks, can you wait till I'm gone?

24:53.591 --> 24:55.676
- Sever the umbilical.
- Cutting.

25:19.116 --> 25:20.576
Breathe!

25:22.620 --> 25:23.954
Come on, yeah. That's it.

25:27.458 --> 25:28.709
Come on, breathe.

25:30.169 --> 25:31.796
Come on.

25:32.546 --> 25:34.507
Come on, come on!
Breathe, breathe!

25:35.382 --> 25:38.594
There we go. Now we're working.
He's healthy.

25:41.722 --> 25:43.224
Welcome to the world.

25:47.394 --> 25:50.648
- So how's Three Hilo?
- Good.

25:53.025 --> 25:55.319
He's feisty. Light.

25:56.737 --> 25:59.615
Vitals seem fine.

26:00.324 --> 26:02.868
- Smooth extraction?
- Yep.

26:05.704 --> 26:08.040
Looks like we have a fine product.

26:08.415 --> 26:10.459
Tag him and ship him to Foundation.

27:27.870 --> 27:29.538
Little bug.

28:17.169 --> 28:19.755
Next time I won't embarrass you
in front of your friends.

28:27.721 --> 28:29.431
It was very sad.

28:30.099 --> 28:31.433
- Hey.
- Hello.

28:31.600 --> 28:32.976
Hi.

28:34.645 --> 28:37.314
You just let a little girl
beat you, huh?

28:39.483 --> 28:40.818
Stim units restricted.

28:41.026 --> 28:43.070
Yeah, yeah. I'll have the veggie stuff.

28:43.237 --> 28:45.948
Papassian petal juice, please.

28:46.115 --> 28:47.574
It's good for the skin.

29:00.212 --> 29:02.089
Jordan, are you sick?

29:03.048 --> 29:07.177
When I was in Dr. Merrick's office,
I thought I saw your name on a file.

29:07.678 --> 29:09.596
No, I'm fine.

29:09.930 --> 29:11.473
Okay.

29:12.307 --> 29:14.017
How are you?

29:14.309 --> 29:15.853
I'm fine.

29:16.645 --> 29:21.525
Lincoln, I can tell when you lie because
your mouth smiles but your eyes don't.

29:24.069 --> 29:25.571
- I found something.
- What?

29:25.737 --> 29:27.698
- A bug.
- A bug?

29:27.865 --> 29:29.908
- A flying bug.
- Can I see it?

29:30.075 --> 29:32.369
I think it came in the ventilation shaft.

29:32.536 --> 29:34.746
But they went extinct
with the contamination.

29:34.955 --> 29:37.499
I know. And how did it get
by the pathogen sensors?

29:37.666 --> 29:40.043
- It must be too small.
- No, it's not too small.

29:40.252 --> 29:43.213
How did it survive out there, anyway?
How does anyone survive?

29:43.380 --> 29:46.341
They keep finding people and bringing
them here. From where?

29:46.842 --> 29:49.511
It's good that they find survivors.

29:49.678 --> 29:53.432
Why do you always question the good?
You only think about the bad.

29:53.599 --> 29:56.101
I just have a feeling
that something is wrong.

29:57.352 --> 29:59.688
Good things do happen.

29:59.855 --> 30:01.773
I wanna see that bug.

30:03.609 --> 30:06.361
Hey, Gandu learned a new word
from the censor.

30:06.528 --> 30:08.739
- What?
- "Dude."

30:08.906 --> 30:12.576
- "Dude"? What does it mean?
- I don't know. He just called me "dude."

30:12.743 --> 30:14.578
- Hey, dude.
- He said, "Hey, dude"?

30:14.745 --> 30:16.538
Hey, dude. D-O-O-D. "Dood."

30:16.705 --> 30:18.290
- Hey, dood.
- Dood.

30:18.498 --> 30:19.708
Lottery's starting.

30:19.875 --> 30:21.960
- Like you stand a chance.
- Dude.

30:23.253 --> 30:26.006
Light up all etherscreens.

30:26.173 --> 30:29.176
And start the lottery.

30:37.351 --> 30:42.439
<i>Good evening. Live from Ether-Con,
welcome to the lottery spin.</i>

30:43.649 --> 30:45.400
<i>It's been a busy week.</i>

30:45.609 --> 30:48.528
<i>We've had a record two winners
so far.</i>

30:48.737 --> 30:53.450
<i>Tonight's winner will be selected
at random for relocation to The Island...</i>

30:53.617 --> 30:56.328
<i>... transported to the world's
last paradise.</i>

30:56.536 --> 30:59.831
<i>- And start the spin.
- And now let the spin begin.</i>

31:05.087 --> 31:07.130
<i>Jordan Two Delta.</i>

31:07.297 --> 31:10.092
<i>Step up, your time has come.</i>

31:10.300 --> 31:13.136
<i>You're moving out to The Island.</i>

31:18.558 --> 31:22.562
<i>For everyone else, never lose hope.</i>

31:25.273 --> 31:27.192
Thank you. Thank you.

31:27.359 --> 31:30.195
I can't believe it.

31:38.078 --> 31:40.330
I have to go in the morning.

31:40.497 --> 31:42.124
You were right.

31:44.042 --> 31:46.378
Good things do happen.

31:50.424 --> 31:52.592
I wish I'd known you better.

31:54.636 --> 31:57.722
You two. Watch your proximity.

32:06.731 --> 32:08.692
I'll see you on The Island.

32:26.793 --> 32:30.130
You want to go to The Island.

32:35.260 --> 32:36.469
Breathe!

32:38.096 --> 32:39.514
You've been chosen.

32:41.725 --> 32:44.811
<i>The Island awaits you.</i>

35:16.254 --> 35:18.798
She's so beautiful.

35:19.966 --> 35:21.718
I've never seen a baby.

35:22.385 --> 35:24.721
- Can I hold her?
- Not just yet.

35:31.895 --> 35:33.563
We're going to The Island?

36:51.724 --> 36:53.267
Oh, my God.

36:53.977 --> 36:56.437
Congratulations, it's a beautiful girl.

36:56.604 --> 36:58.523
- Oh, my gosh.
- Thank you.

36:58.690 --> 37:01.526
- My baby. Oh, my gosh.
- Whenever you're ready...

37:01.693 --> 37:05.321
...we have copies of your policy
termination for your records.

37:05.738 --> 37:08.157
Look at her. She's beautiful.

37:11.077 --> 37:14.247
Starkweather? That cute football player
on the Reebok commercials?

37:14.414 --> 37:17.125
I love him! Is he in there?
I thought that was him, girl!

37:17.333 --> 37:18.835
I just love him.

37:19.919 --> 37:22.046
That's great.
Listen, you're a real hoot.

37:22.255 --> 37:24.298
Any chance I can make this pickup?

37:24.465 --> 37:26.426
Well, he's still in surgery. Sorry.

37:26.634 --> 37:30.805
Lady, I've got a bird on the pad
and a storm's coming in.

37:31.013 --> 37:34.142
We don't fly in bad weather.

37:37.937 --> 37:40.440
They look real busy,
so I'd have a seat.

37:41.858 --> 37:43.985
Grim Reaper coming in here
with an attitude.

37:44.360 --> 37:49.323
Heart rate, 102. BP, 126/82.

37:49.490 --> 37:51.784
- All right, laser cutter ready?
- It's ready.

37:51.951 --> 37:54.579
- Make sure suction's functioning.
- Ventilating easily.

37:54.746 --> 37:56.539
- Very good.
- Grid in place.

37:56.706 --> 37:58.791
Prepare that bone saw.

37:59.792 --> 38:02.211
I think we're about ready to open.

38:20.897 --> 38:22.732
Let's clean that drip.

38:27.069 --> 38:28.613
Doctor, heart rate's rising.

38:30.865 --> 38:34.952
Heart rate's still rising, doctor.

38:38.498 --> 38:41.250
- What's his blood pressure?
- BP, 138/92.

38:43.794 --> 38:46.464
- Heart rate's still rising.
- Boost the anesthetic level.

38:47.673 --> 38:49.175
He's fighting the ventilator.

38:49.342 --> 38:52.553
I don't wanna have to euthanize
this guy to get his liver.

39:03.022 --> 39:04.607
Oh, my God!

39:12.240 --> 39:14.742
Stop that man! Get him!

39:21.958 --> 39:23.376
Stop!

39:40.184 --> 39:42.019
Relax. Relax, big guy.

39:42.228 --> 39:44.188
Easy, easy! Don't damage him!

39:48.275 --> 39:51.904
No! I don't wanna die! No!

39:52.113 --> 39:55.825
I want to go to The Island!
You promised!

39:56.158 --> 39:59.328
I wanna live! I don't wanna die!

40:00.413 --> 40:01.747
No!

40:03.541 --> 40:06.377
Hey. You okay, buddy?

40:06.794 --> 40:09.296
It's not the first time
this has happened, you know.

40:09.463 --> 40:12.633
Ether-Con. Product is secure.

40:24.186 --> 40:25.354
Check this part out.

40:25.563 --> 40:27.481
Wait. Okay, watch. Wait, wait, wait.

40:27.690 --> 40:29.775
Boom! Did you see that?

40:29.984 --> 40:34.155
Man. That is so cruel, man.

40:34.655 --> 40:37.408
Oh, man. Down for the count.

40:37.950 --> 40:39.952
Gentlemen.

40:40.161 --> 40:42.496
I understand there's been an incident.

40:42.705 --> 40:45.082
Sir, Starkweather ran
from the operating theater.

40:45.249 --> 40:47.543
- And you find that funny?
- No, sir.

40:48.085 --> 40:50.713
- Do you?
- Definitely not, sir.

40:50.921 --> 40:53.007
Play it back, please.

40:58.304 --> 40:59.847
Stop.

41:00.264 --> 41:01.932
- Who is that?
- That's just an RN.

41:02.099 --> 41:04.226
He was scared. I helped him up.

41:05.144 --> 41:06.520
Play it back at half-speed.

41:13.611 --> 41:15.529
Freeze.

41:16.322 --> 41:17.573
Magnify his wrist.

41:22.703 --> 41:24.330
We have a product on the loose.

41:25.748 --> 41:28.000
- Get me a facial match.
- We're on it.

41:28.209 --> 41:30.711
- Let's go.
- Okay, down to Level Two.

42:11.919 --> 42:14.421
- How sweet. You came to...
- You gotta come with me.

42:14.880 --> 42:16.715
Move! Move!

42:25.474 --> 42:28.227
We got a match! Lincoln Six Echo.

42:28.394 --> 42:32.106
I want a full contamination lockdown.
Find Six Echo.

42:34.650 --> 42:35.985
Everybody, masks down.

42:36.193 --> 42:38.737
- What the hell?
- I need to see all your faces.

42:38.946 --> 42:41.532
I don't care what he says.
That's live human tissue.

42:41.699 --> 42:44.493
- Seal that liver now.
- Check the back corners.

42:48.914 --> 42:53.294
How did that agnate get upstairs
into the Medical Sector?

42:53.836 --> 42:55.170
Find out.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.842
What are you doing?
Men can't be in this...

43:00.009 --> 43:02.344
- You gotta trust me. I saw them.
- Who?

43:02.553 --> 43:04.638
- Lima and Starkweather. They're dead.
- What?

43:04.805 --> 43:06.390
They killed her and cut him open.

43:06.598 --> 43:08.434
Stop it! I wanna go back to my room.

43:08.642 --> 43:11.395
- You can't. They'll kill you.
- I'm going to The Island.

43:11.603 --> 43:13.731
- Jordan, there is no Island! Come on!
- No.

43:15.524 --> 43:18.110
I got Six Echo in Female Tower,
floor 32.

43:18.277 --> 43:20.696
- He's got a female product in tow.
- Track that.

43:20.904 --> 43:23.198
Get out of the way! Watch out.

43:23.407 --> 43:25.075
Move! Move!

43:25.284 --> 43:27.244
Out of the way. Get out. Now.

43:28.120 --> 43:29.163
Just trust me.

43:33.751 --> 43:35.919
<i>This is a community bulletin.</i>

43:36.336 --> 43:37.963
<i>Attention, residents.</i>

43:38.130 --> 43:41.884
<i>A contamination alert
has been issued for Lincoln Six Echo.</i>

43:42.301 --> 43:46.388
<i>Anyone coming in contact with him
will be quarantined.</i>

43:48.724 --> 43:51.018
Faster! Move!

43:55.230 --> 43:56.690
Freeze! Stop right there!

43:59.526 --> 44:00.944
Get out of the way!

44:18.212 --> 44:20.005
- Go, go!
- Get out of the way!

44:29.097 --> 44:31.600
I've got two agnates on the move
on the second floor.

44:46.657 --> 44:48.534
There they are!

44:49.284 --> 44:51.662
I've got them
in the Sector Six basement!

44:51.828 --> 44:53.163
Get them!

45:04.716 --> 45:06.468
- No!
- Stop!

45:17.312 --> 45:18.939
Lincoln!

45:19.273 --> 45:21.608
No! Stop it!

45:24.444 --> 45:26.154
No!

46:03.734 --> 46:05.527
<i>You've been chosen.</i>

46:05.736 --> 46:08.655
<i>You have a very special purpose in life.
Chosen to survive.</i>

46:08.822 --> 46:12.075
<i>You are part of a new beginning.
You're special.</i>

46:12.242 --> 46:16.204
<i>You have a very special purpose in life.</i>

46:19.708 --> 46:23.587
<i>You want to go to The Island.</i>

46:23.795 --> 46:25.964
<i>You're a part of a new beginning.</i>

46:26.131 --> 46:28.508
<i>You're special. You've been chosen.</i>

46:28.717 --> 46:31.344
<i>Very special. Chosen to survive.</i>

46:31.553 --> 46:35.974
<i>To carry on.
You want to go to The Island.</i>

46:40.062 --> 46:41.980
Go, go!

46:47.527 --> 46:49.696
<i>Very special.</i>

46:50.781 --> 46:52.574
- He's gotta be in here.
- I'm looking!

46:52.783 --> 46:54.659
Check over here!

46:54.868 --> 46:57.037
Watch your left! Watch your left!

46:57.871 --> 46:59.414
Run.

47:03.043 --> 47:04.503
Run.

47:04.711 --> 47:06.588
He's over here.

47:08.090 --> 47:12.594
<i>Very special.
You want to go to The Island.</i>

47:12.761 --> 47:15.138
There they are.

47:28.777 --> 47:31.029
- Lincoln!
- Come on!

47:31.196 --> 47:33.532
Get them! Let's go!

47:33.740 --> 47:36.701
- Move!
- Come on!

47:37.828 --> 47:39.663
Come on, come on. Damn!

47:40.455 --> 47:43.333
Go, go, go. Come on.

47:47.045 --> 47:49.339
You still think there's an Island?

48:00.100 --> 48:01.560
Come on.

48:26.960 --> 48:29.254
Come on. Come on.

48:47.355 --> 48:49.149
There's a door over here!

50:04.808 --> 50:09.604
<i>Lincoln Six Echo remains in quarantine
after contamination exposure.</i>

50:09.771 --> 50:14.901
<i>Jordan Two Delta was safely transported
to her new home on The Island.</i>

50:15.318 --> 50:18.363
Jones Three Echo, I need you
to concentrate in this lab.

50:18.571 --> 50:21.699
Sir, I want to focus.
I love my job. It's very interesting.

50:21.908 --> 50:24.911
But Lincoln Six Echo
has been contaminated...

50:25.120 --> 50:28.456
...and it really worries me because
he's a very good friend of mine.

50:28.623 --> 50:30.542
And he's my only best friend.

50:30.750 --> 50:32.961
He'll be fine, Three Echo.

50:33.128 --> 50:37.215
Sir, I have one question.
Where do all the tubes go?

50:39.884 --> 50:41.636
<i>The human organism.</i>

50:41.803 --> 50:44.681
<i>Unique in all the universe
in its complexity.</i>

50:44.848 --> 50:47.600
<i>The product of 3 billion years
of evolution.</i>

50:47.767 --> 50:51.145
<i>Prefect in every way except one.</i>

50:51.354 --> 50:54.858
<i>Like all machines, it wears out.</i>

50:55.400 --> 50:58.194
<i>For centuries, the idea of replenishing
the human body...</i>

50:58.403 --> 51:00.446
<i>... has been at the forefront
of science.</i>

51:00.613 --> 51:03.283
I think we need to turn this bad day
into a good day.

51:03.449 --> 51:05.952
- How?
- By selling. Sell, sell, sell.

51:06.119 --> 51:07.662
You start, I finish.

51:18.047 --> 51:19.924
Ladies and gentlemen...

51:20.091 --> 51:23.803
...welcome to the next generation
of science:

51:24.012 --> 51:25.889
The agnate.

51:26.055 --> 51:30.143
An organic frame engineered
directly into adulthood...

51:30.310 --> 51:31.894
...to match the client's age.

51:32.604 --> 51:36.107
You're looking at stage one
of its development.

51:36.274 --> 51:38.818
Within 12 months,
it will be harvest-ready...

51:38.985 --> 51:43.239
...providing a carrier for your baby,
a second pair of lungs, fresh skin...

51:43.406 --> 51:46.784
...all genetically indistinguishable
from your own.

51:46.951 --> 51:51.664
And in compliance
with the eugenics laws of 2015...

51:51.831 --> 51:57.003
...all our agnates are maintained
in a persistent vegetative state.

51:57.170 --> 51:59.297
They never achieve consciousness.

51:59.505 --> 52:02.008
They never think...

52:02.175 --> 52:06.846
...or suffer or feel pain,
joy, love, hate.

52:07.013 --> 52:09.766
It's a product, ladies and gentlemen...

52:09.932 --> 52:11.726
...in every way that matters.

52:12.727 --> 52:15.355
<i>Not human.</i>

52:19.651 --> 52:22.904
This is our public-relations director,
Mr. Whitman.

52:23.071 --> 52:25.239
He'll be happy to answer
your questions.

52:25.406 --> 52:27.408
Once again, thank you.
Mr. Whitman.

52:27.617 --> 52:31.537
I wanna talk about the smartest
investment you'll ever make.

52:32.330 --> 52:36.167
And I wanna tell you how you're gonna
live 60 to 70 years longer.

52:40.505 --> 52:43.925
Dr. Merrick, Albert Laurent,
Blackhawk Security.

52:44.092 --> 52:47.387
You come highly recommended by
the Defense Department, Mr. Laurent.

52:47.595 --> 52:50.306
Though I'm unaware
of your personal qualifications.

52:50.473 --> 52:53.184
My men are ex-Delta Force. SEALs.

52:53.351 --> 52:56.062
I was formerly with the GIGN,
French special forces.

52:56.270 --> 52:58.439
I understand you had
a corporate theft.

52:58.648 --> 53:01.025
Yes, that's what I told
the Defense Department.

53:01.192 --> 53:05.029
The reality is a little more complex.
That's why I require your services.

53:05.196 --> 53:08.199
We've had a security breach.

53:08.408 --> 53:11.953
You have the Defense Department
at your disposal. Why call me?

53:12.161 --> 53:14.789
Because their investment here
is sizable.

53:14.956 --> 53:18.042
One hundred and twenty billion dollars,
to be exact.

53:18.209 --> 53:21.003
And I can't afford for them
to reconsider.

53:21.212 --> 53:23.297
What you tell them
is your business, doctor.

53:23.464 --> 53:26.342
I am in the business of keeping
my clients' confidence.

53:27.093 --> 53:28.636
Good.

53:32.598 --> 53:35.184
Two of our products have escaped.

53:35.393 --> 53:37.895
Impressive, considering
they're vegetative.

53:38.062 --> 53:41.023
Well, after several years
of trial and error...

53:41.190 --> 53:43.359
...we discovered that
without consciousness...

53:43.526 --> 53:45.528
...without human experience, emotion...

53:46.279 --> 53:48.114
...without life...

53:48.948 --> 53:50.992
...the organs failed.

53:53.035 --> 53:54.704
How long have they been missing?

53:55.580 --> 53:57.623
Four hours and 36 minutes.

53:57.790 --> 54:00.501
- They're on foot?
- Yes.

54:00.668 --> 54:04.380
Wade, 1.2 miles an hour,
five-mile perimeter.

54:04.589 --> 54:06.632
Stand by for suspect description.

54:06.841 --> 54:09.093
- We're on it.
- Follow me.

54:26.277 --> 54:29.530
- Come on. We gotta keep going.
- I have to stop. I can't run anymore.

54:29.697 --> 54:31.198
- You gotta try. Come on.
- Where?

54:31.407 --> 54:33.576
- Anywhere but here.
- But there's nothing.

54:33.743 --> 54:36.287
Everything's dead, Lincoln.

54:42.168 --> 54:44.337
What if we are contaminated?

54:45.129 --> 54:46.964
Then we'd be dead.

54:47.965 --> 54:51.469
There's no contamination.
It was a lie.

55:01.854 --> 55:03.189
What is it?

55:03.356 --> 55:06.400
I don't know. But it's alive.

55:11.280 --> 55:14.075
Come on. It's mean, whatever it is.

55:14.241 --> 55:15.576
Let's rest in here.

55:15.743 --> 55:19.538
Jordan Two Delta sponsor, Sarah Jordan,
is in a coma after a car accident.

55:19.705 --> 55:21.999
She's in need of multiple
organ transplants.

55:22.166 --> 55:23.292
How long does she have?

55:23.709 --> 55:25.836
Forty-eight hours.
Three days, maximum.

55:26.170 --> 55:27.630
Tell me about Six Echo.

55:27.838 --> 55:31.175
Well, he was really the first one
to question his environment...

55:31.342 --> 55:32.718
...his whole existence here.

55:33.844 --> 55:37.098
The last few months, he began
demonstrating unstable behavior...

55:37.264 --> 55:39.892
...and I can't account for it.

55:40.101 --> 55:42.395
I'm waiting on the result
of his synaptic scan.

55:42.561 --> 55:44.355
What do they know
about the outside world?

55:45.231 --> 55:46.941
Very little.

55:47.108 --> 55:50.152
We control them with the memory
of a shared event.

55:50.319 --> 55:51.821
A global contamination.

55:52.029 --> 55:54.532
It keeps them fearful of going outside.

55:54.740 --> 55:58.744
The Island is the one thing
that gives them hope.

55:59.286 --> 56:01.414
Gives them purpose.

56:02.039 --> 56:04.208
Everything we expose them to...

56:04.375 --> 56:07.837
...their programs, their cartoons,
books, the games they play...

56:08.045 --> 56:11.507
...are designed to manage aggression
and reinforce simple social skills.

56:12.091 --> 56:14.135
<i>To avoid obvious complications...</i>

56:14.301 --> 56:16.929
<i>... they aren't imprinted
with an awareness of sex.</i>

56:17.096 --> 56:20.224
<i>We find it simpler to eliminate
the drive altogether.</i>

56:20.975 --> 56:23.477
In a very real sense...

56:24.270 --> 56:26.105
...they're like children.

56:26.272 --> 56:28.816
Educated to the level of a 15-year-old.

56:46.208 --> 56:49.253
- What was that?
- I don't know.

56:50.963 --> 56:52.965
But I want one.

57:07.313 --> 57:08.856
Look!

57:09.815 --> 57:13.068
Route 39. Route 39.

57:13.235 --> 57:14.862
Come on.

57:15.571 --> 57:17.865
I got it from a friend.

57:42.431 --> 57:44.391
I think that's it.

58:16.048 --> 58:17.383
What's up?

58:17.549 --> 58:19.635
Yeah, do you know
a guy named McCord?

58:21.387 --> 58:23.472
Yeah, we know that tool.
Who's asking?

58:24.556 --> 58:28.185
- I am.
- And you would be who?

58:28.435 --> 58:31.355
- Lincoln Six Echo.
- Jordan Two Delta.

58:32.815 --> 58:34.441
Right.

58:35.150 --> 58:37.403
Y'all some of those
desert UFO freaks?

58:37.611 --> 58:40.864
- U...? What? No. I don't think so, no.
- No.

58:41.031 --> 58:43.075
- McCord?
- Well, lucky day, Captain Kirk.

58:43.242 --> 58:45.452
- He's in the can.
- He's in a can?

58:45.661 --> 58:47.371
Taking a dump.

58:47.579 --> 58:49.707
A dump? Taking it where?

58:51.458 --> 58:53.794
Tell you what,
you're fixing to get on my nerves.

58:53.961 --> 58:57.256
- It's the first door on the right.
- Thank you.

58:57.423 --> 59:00.134
I have to go.
He's taking a dump in a can.

59:00.342 --> 59:03.262
- Something to drink? Jack?
- Yes, please.

59:03.637 --> 59:05.305
Straight up?

59:16.984 --> 59:18.610
That is bitchen.

59:21.029 --> 59:22.698
So this is Sector Five?

59:22.906 --> 59:25.033
Hey! You son of a bitch!

59:26.994 --> 59:28.704
You knew!

59:28.871 --> 59:32.291
- How the hell did you get out?
- Why? Why do they lie to us? Tell me!

59:32.458 --> 59:35.085
- They'll be looking for you.
- Tell me what's going on!

59:35.294 --> 59:39.298
What's going on is if anybody sees us
together, both of us are gonna be dead.

59:39.715 --> 59:42.217
So will you just take your hands off me?
Let me...

59:43.051 --> 59:46.597
Let me pull my pants up.
I'll take you back to my place...

59:47.055 --> 59:48.432
...so we can be alone, okay?

59:51.727 --> 59:54.897
- Ed.
- Mac.

59:56.023 --> 59:58.233
Give you boys a minute?

01:00:00.402 --> 01:00:02.237
What? This isn't what it looks like.

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.617
Sure. Sure.

01:00:06.825 --> 01:00:11.246
Get out of here, you stupid...
Will you stop?

01:00:12.414 --> 01:00:15.667
You can't just bust in on a guy like that.
That's really rude.

01:00:17.211 --> 01:00:19.463
She doesn't understand licking.

01:00:19.630 --> 01:00:22.382
What are you, a knucklehead?
You brought another with you?

01:00:22.591 --> 01:00:24.051
Excuse me. Listen, will you...?

01:00:24.218 --> 01:00:26.762
Hey, back off, Joe, okay?
Don't push me!

01:00:26.929 --> 01:00:29.681
No, that's no good.
Put it on my tab. We gotta go.

01:00:29.848 --> 01:00:31.850
Friends of mine.
They're from out of town.

01:00:32.017 --> 01:00:33.602
- Let's go.
- Give me your number.

01:00:33.769 --> 01:00:37.189
- Two Delta.
- Hey. Don't test me.

01:00:37.356 --> 01:00:38.941
Don't.

01:00:50.827 --> 01:00:53.330
Well, this is nice.

01:00:56.708 --> 01:00:59.419
Mac doesn't talk much
about his work at the Institute.

01:00:59.586 --> 01:01:01.755
Do y'all work with him?

01:01:03.090 --> 01:01:06.176
Saving lives and all
must be real rewarding.

01:01:06.343 --> 01:01:08.428
Some fancy tracksuits.

01:01:08.929 --> 01:01:13.141
Y'all exercise out in this heat, you'll get
yourself some nasty heat stroke.

01:01:13.308 --> 01:01:14.643
Oh, Mac.

01:01:14.851 --> 01:01:18.563
Look, they got matching bracelets.
We should do that, honey.

01:01:18.772 --> 01:01:20.148
Suzie.

01:01:21.441 --> 01:01:24.027
Do you remember the talk
we had about all the talk?

01:01:25.821 --> 01:01:27.155
Yeah.

01:01:27.322 --> 01:01:29.950
Would you run down to Red's
and pick up a sixer of Bud?

01:01:30.158 --> 01:01:33.370
- We gotta talk shop.
- Okay, baby.

01:01:33.578 --> 01:01:34.913
Just making friends.

01:01:35.122 --> 01:01:37.040
- I know. Good. Just...
- Bye.

01:01:43.630 --> 01:01:44.881
Why do they lie, Mac?

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:47.968
Why do they lie to us? Tell me.

01:01:51.221 --> 01:01:53.265
To keep you from knowing
what you are.

01:01:54.307 --> 01:01:57.769
- What we are?
- What are we?

01:01:58.228 --> 01:02:01.815
Man, why do I gotta be the guy that
tells the kids there's no Santa Claus?

01:02:06.236 --> 01:02:08.613
Okay, look. You're...

01:02:10.907 --> 01:02:13.034
Well, you're not like me.

01:02:15.370 --> 01:02:17.998
I mean, you're not human.

01:02:19.624 --> 01:02:23.879
I mean, you're human, but you're just...
You're not real.

01:02:24.337 --> 01:02:26.006
You're not like a real person.

01:02:26.339 --> 01:02:28.008
Like me.

01:02:30.927 --> 01:02:32.971
You're clones.

01:02:35.348 --> 01:02:38.977
You're copies of people
out here in the world.

01:02:39.686 --> 01:02:41.021
- What?
- Clones?

01:02:41.188 --> 01:02:43.398
- What? Why?
- What are you talking about?

01:02:43.607 --> 01:02:46.359
Some hag trophy wife
needs new skin for a face-lift...

01:02:46.568 --> 01:02:50.906
...or one of them gets sick and they
need a new part, they take it from you.

01:02:52.866 --> 01:02:55.911
But I have a mother. I remember her.

01:02:56.119 --> 01:02:58.163
- Yeah, I know.
- I grew up on a farm.

01:02:58.371 --> 01:03:01.958
- I have a little dog and I had a bike.
- And a bike. Right.

01:03:02.125 --> 01:03:05.378
It was a pink Flexi-Flyer
with little tassels on the handlebars...

01:03:05.587 --> 01:03:07.672
...and you rode it
to your grandma's house.

01:03:07.881 --> 01:03:11.009
You ring a bell. She came out,
served you cookies on a hot plate.

01:03:11.384 --> 01:03:15.347
- Yeah.
- No. Memory imprints.

01:03:16.431 --> 01:03:20.185
I seen them. My buddy is a programmer
at the Institute. He showed me.

01:03:20.352 --> 01:03:23.605
There's only, like, 12 stories.
They change around little details.

01:03:23.813 --> 01:03:25.899
But they're all pretty much the same.

01:03:26.107 --> 01:03:31.571
The life you think you had
before the "contamination"?

01:03:31.738 --> 01:03:33.615
It never happened.

01:03:35.283 --> 01:03:38.787
Come on, don't look at me like that.
At least you had a bike.

01:03:38.954 --> 01:03:43.041
Wanna trade your rosy memory implants
for my shitty childhood? Be my guest.

01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:44.626
How long?

01:03:45.877 --> 01:03:47.379
How long have we been alive?

01:03:48.838 --> 01:03:51.508
You're Echo generation, so you're 3.

01:03:53.385 --> 01:03:54.719
Delta means you're 4.

01:03:57.514 --> 01:03:58.682
Three?

01:03:58.848 --> 01:04:02.727
The whole reason you exist is because
everyone wants to live forever.

01:04:02.894 --> 01:04:04.479
It's the new American dream.

01:04:04.646 --> 01:04:08.066
There's people out there that are
rich enough to pay anything for it.

01:04:08.275 --> 01:04:11.486
Don't people care that they kill us?
That they take parts from us?

01:04:11.653 --> 01:04:15.949
They don't know. They think you're
vegetables simmering in a jelly sac.

01:04:16.741 --> 01:04:20.829
Why do you think Merrick has you stuck
in an old military bunker below ground?

01:04:20.996 --> 01:04:24.374
He doesn't want anyone knowing
the truth. Especially not your sponsors.

01:04:24.874 --> 01:04:28.294
- Sponsors?
- The people that had you made.

01:04:28.461 --> 01:04:30.505
They, like, own you.

01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:38.388
But why doesn't Merrick want
our owners to know that we're alive?

01:04:38.888 --> 01:04:43.018
Just because people eat the burger
doesn't mean they wanna meet the cow.

01:04:44.310 --> 01:04:45.645
Besides...

01:04:45.812 --> 01:04:50.400
...do you know how many laws Merrick's
breaking to have you two hatched?

01:04:52.318 --> 01:04:54.320
Your sponsors can't have
any part of that.

01:04:54.487 --> 01:04:57.073
They're, like, high society.
Rich and famous.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:59.451
If they knew,
Merrick would be out of business.

01:04:59.617 --> 01:05:02.579
We have to find our sponsors
and tell them the real truth.

01:05:02.787 --> 01:05:04.122
- What? No.
- Yeah.

01:05:04.289 --> 01:05:06.207
No. That's the worst idea
I ever heard.

01:05:06.374 --> 01:05:08.877
You know how dead I would be?
Not to mention fired?

01:05:09.085 --> 01:05:11.254
We will. We will.
That's our only chance.

01:05:11.463 --> 01:05:13.923
Stop! Fold, stop. Brakes.
No. Come on.

01:05:14.090 --> 01:05:16.593
You're like the replacement engines
on their Bentley.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.846
They're not gonna care.
They don't care. They're gonna care?

01:05:20.263 --> 01:05:22.348
You know what I would do
if I were you?

01:05:22.557 --> 01:05:26.019
I would get as far away from here
as I could. Go to the beach.

01:05:26.227 --> 01:05:29.314
We're not asking
for your permission, Mac.

01:05:29.606 --> 01:05:31.232
We're asking for your help.

01:05:32.942 --> 01:05:34.652
Oh, God.

01:05:42.952 --> 01:05:46.414
Infrared's having a hard time getting
a heat signature on our fugitives.

01:05:46.581 --> 01:05:48.416
Sand's too hot.

01:05:51.878 --> 01:05:54.297
He was implanted
with microsensors yesterday.

01:05:54.714 --> 01:05:58.301
Can we configure our instrument
to pick up a low-frequency RF scan?

01:05:58.510 --> 01:06:01.679
- If we're within half a mile of the source.
- Do it.

01:06:02.222 --> 01:06:04.766
Your sponsors' names
are Tom Lincoln and Sarah Jordan.

01:06:04.933 --> 01:06:06.768
Her sponsor lives in New York.

01:06:06.935 --> 01:06:09.521
The number in your name
is a regional code.

01:06:09.687 --> 01:06:13.733
Six Echo, it means
your sponsor lives in L.A.

01:06:13.942 --> 01:06:15.944
- You're going out of state.
- Out of state.

01:06:16.152 --> 01:06:17.904
Yeah. Put this on. No, no, no.

01:06:18.071 --> 01:06:20.823
You're gonna go in here.
All right? Come on, come on.

01:06:21.032 --> 01:06:23.701
Keep going. What size?

01:06:25.995 --> 01:06:28.289
These are bags, okay?
You put stuff in them.

01:06:28.456 --> 01:06:31.167
Backpacks for boys, purses for girls.
Understand?

01:06:31.334 --> 01:06:32.669
We're not idiots.

01:06:32.835 --> 01:06:35.964
Excuse me, Miss I'm-So-Smart-
l-Can't-Wait-to-Go-to-The-Island.

01:06:39.592 --> 01:06:40.677
Yeah. Good.

01:06:47.183 --> 01:06:50.561
Wait. Hold. People don't really wear
these on the outside.

01:06:50.728 --> 01:06:53.940
These are mail-order, okay?
They stay here.

01:06:56.567 --> 01:07:00.321
No. Mail-order, okay?
Clones don't wear these.

01:07:04.284 --> 01:07:05.618
All right. Listen up.

01:07:05.785 --> 01:07:08.496
This card is like stim credits.

01:07:08.663 --> 01:07:11.666
It'll get you food, but I gotta
report it stolen in 24 hours...

01:07:11.833 --> 01:07:16.170
...or else they'll know I helped you.
After that, use the cash.

01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:23.261
All right, look. I know you're new to
this whole human experience and all...

01:07:23.428 --> 01:07:25.388
...but there's one universal truth...

01:07:25.596 --> 01:07:28.599
...and that is you never give a woman
your credit card.

01:07:28.766 --> 01:07:30.351
Right.

01:07:36.566 --> 01:07:38.109
I got something. It's hot.

01:07:53.624 --> 01:07:56.044
Train will be here in a few minutes.
Hustle up.

01:07:56.252 --> 01:07:59.672
<i>- And Sacramento is
now boarding at platform A.</i>

01:07:59.881 --> 01:08:02.216
All right, stay. All right? Just stay.

01:08:02.425 --> 01:08:04.052
Don't move.

01:08:10.141 --> 01:08:12.018
Look at that.

01:08:12.393 --> 01:08:14.187
Those are kids.

01:08:23.654 --> 01:08:26.948
Come here. The train is nonstop to L.A.
You need these to get on.

01:08:27.116 --> 01:08:30.787
When you arrive, look up your sponsors
in the information directory. Got it?

01:08:30.953 --> 01:08:34.332
Yeah. Yeah.
What is an information directory?

01:08:34.499 --> 01:08:36.292
It'll tell you where they live.

01:08:36.501 --> 01:08:39.212
And whatever you do,
do not trust anyone.

01:08:39.377 --> 01:08:43.049
One thing I can tell you about people
is that they'll do anything to survive.

01:08:43.633 --> 01:08:45.134
Thank you, Mac. Thank you.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.095
Thanks a lot.

01:08:48.261 --> 01:08:51.557
All right. I'm just gonna go upstairs
and get you guys a map of L.A.

01:08:51.765 --> 01:08:53.975
Better not get me in trouble.

01:09:15.957 --> 01:09:18.042
I think I got an ID. Two in the center.

01:09:24.549 --> 01:09:26.551
Run!

01:11:02.146 --> 01:11:03.731
Run!

01:11:05.483 --> 01:11:07.568
Oh, God!

01:11:10.488 --> 01:11:15.326
<i>Amtrak train 227 now departing
for Los Angeles at platform C.</i>

01:11:20.623 --> 01:11:23.501
What's wrong with these people?
They killed him.

01:11:38.099 --> 01:11:40.810
- This was supposed to be simple.
- It's never simple.

01:11:40.976 --> 01:11:42.561
We got a missing credit card.

01:11:42.728 --> 01:11:45.564
McCord just used it
to buy train tickets.

01:11:45.731 --> 01:11:48.484
- It's not in his wallet.
- Monitor the account.

01:11:48.692 --> 01:11:51.904
Have Amtrak patch you through
to the train conductor.

01:11:52.613 --> 01:11:54.365
Get me a new team in L.A.

01:11:57.409 --> 01:11:59.870
Got here as fast as I could.

01:12:00.412 --> 01:12:03.415
I finished scanning the
Defense Department troop selections...

01:12:03.582 --> 01:12:06.085
...if you want to see them.
- Not yet. Look at that.

01:12:08.087 --> 01:12:10.965
- Six Echo drew it.
- Well, it's elaborate.

01:12:11.173 --> 01:12:13.634
<i>"Renovatio."</i>

01:12:13.843 --> 01:12:16.512
<i>"Renovatio"? Renovatio.</i>

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.431
- What is that, Italian?
- It's Latin.

01:12:20.474 --> 01:12:22.560
We've never imprinted
an agnate with Latin.

01:12:22.768 --> 01:12:24.937
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:27.731
So where did he learn it?

01:12:28.774 --> 01:12:30.901
Where are the results
from his synaptic scan?

01:12:31.068 --> 01:12:32.987
They'll be back from Johns Hopkins...

01:12:33.195 --> 01:12:35.364
- Just speed it up.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:48.752 --> 01:12:50.087
You two.

01:12:55.301 --> 01:12:56.760
Over there!

01:14:46.411 --> 01:14:49.957
We just arrived, but Troy's already
tapped into the city cameras.

01:14:57.339 --> 01:15:00.676
Excuse me.
Where's an information directory?

01:15:00.843 --> 01:15:02.553
Thanks.

01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:10.894
Wilshire. Fifth. Grand.

01:15:11.061 --> 01:15:14.189
Spring. Grand Avenue?

01:15:14.398 --> 01:15:15.858
Smile for the camera.

01:15:24.241 --> 01:15:27.452
Where is Flower? You on Flower?

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.496
Olive?

01:15:29.663 --> 01:15:31.290
Come on, come on.

01:15:31.456 --> 01:15:34.793
You look familiar. Gotcha.

01:15:37.421 --> 01:15:39.756
Three Black Wasps and two jet bikes.

01:15:39.965 --> 01:15:42.301
Hey! We just got a facial hit
on our fugitives!

01:15:48.265 --> 01:15:50.142
We're moving! Let's go.

01:16:02.070 --> 01:16:06.617
We got a hit on McCord's credit card.
Location: Grand Avenue at 9830.

01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:11.496
- Team, proceed immediately to 9830...
- No. L.A.P.D.'s moving in.

01:16:11.663 --> 01:16:13.582
They just flagged McCord's
credit card.

01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:16.376
<i>- Tom Lincoln.
- One moment, please.</i>

01:16:18.295 --> 01:16:19.796
<i>Not listed.</i>

01:16:20.005 --> 01:16:21.465
Sarah Jordan.

01:16:28.513 --> 01:16:32.517
<i>- Hello?
- Yes, I'm looking for Sarah Jordan.</i>

01:16:33.393 --> 01:16:35.437
<i>She's sick.</i>

01:16:36.104 --> 01:16:39.816
<i>- Can I talk to her?
- She's at the hospital.</i>

01:16:40.442 --> 01:16:42.235
<i>Mommy, is that you?</i>

01:16:58.293 --> 01:17:00.462
Jordan, let's go.

01:17:03.048 --> 01:17:04.841
Freeze! Put your hands up!

01:17:05.050 --> 01:17:07.302
- Get your hands up!
- Put your hands up!

01:17:07.511 --> 01:17:09.346
Do as I say! Do as I say!

01:17:10.806 --> 01:17:12.974
- Lincoln!
- Just do what they say.

01:17:13.183 --> 01:17:14.518
Lincoln.

01:17:14.726 --> 01:17:16.478
Just pull back!

01:17:26.488 --> 01:17:28.573
Nail it! Quick! Move!

01:17:39.292 --> 01:17:42.087
We're detaining you for
the murder of James McCord.

01:17:42.254 --> 01:17:44.589
He was helping us!
He was my friend.

01:17:44.756 --> 01:17:47.134
Anything you say can be used
in a court of law.

01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.468
What's a court of law?

01:17:52.222 --> 01:17:53.765
They'll run DNA.

01:17:53.974 --> 01:17:58.562
If the agnates are booked, it'll implicate
your clients in a murder investigation.

01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:01.690
This is a nightmare.
You cannot allow this to happen.

01:18:01.857 --> 01:18:05.277
Do you understand me?
You use any force that is necessary.

01:18:05.485 --> 01:18:07.946
I'm ordering you to contain
the situation.

01:18:08.155 --> 01:18:11.241
One-Adam-82. We've apprehended
the suspects. Two adults, no ID.

01:18:11.783 --> 01:18:13.994
Notify Forensics.
We'll need DNA typing.

01:18:14.202 --> 01:18:16.496
- My name is Tom Lincoln.
- Sit back and shut up.

01:18:16.663 --> 01:18:19.791
- Could you look up my file, please?
- Sit back.

01:18:34.806 --> 01:18:37.642
Dispatch, we're two minutes out.

01:18:49.404 --> 01:18:52.365
Lincoln, get up!
Get up, Lincoln! Get up!

01:18:59.289 --> 01:19:00.999
Let's go!

01:19:03.627 --> 01:19:05.295
Go!

01:19:08.423 --> 01:19:09.966
We got cops. We got cops!

01:19:17.682 --> 01:19:18.934
Get down!

01:19:26.566 --> 01:19:28.401
Run!

01:19:29.235 --> 01:19:31.363
I see them! Let's get moving!

01:19:33.156 --> 01:19:35.700
Let's go!
Come on, come on, come on!

01:19:36.826 --> 01:19:38.411
Move, move!

01:19:38.578 --> 01:19:39.954
Move out! Move out!

01:20:01.643 --> 01:20:03.853
Go, go, go!

01:20:15.031 --> 01:20:16.908
Shit! Check up here!

01:20:55.947 --> 01:20:59.325
Air Two, give me status
of the targets.

01:20:59.826 --> 01:21:02.871
- Targets are under the train wheels.
- Silently take them out.

01:21:05.957 --> 01:21:07.667
Go!

01:21:09.919 --> 01:21:11.629
Move! Go, go!

01:21:11.838 --> 01:21:14.549
- I can't fit! I can't fit!
- Move it!

01:21:33.109 --> 01:21:34.944
Look out, look out, look out!

01:21:40.825 --> 01:21:42.243
Right, right, right!

01:21:57.008 --> 01:21:58.635
<i>Stay on them!</i>

01:22:00.303 --> 01:22:01.554
Look out!

01:22:06.267 --> 01:22:08.853
Do not let him get away!
Do not let him get away!

01:22:31.668 --> 01:22:33.378
Good job.

01:22:34.921 --> 01:22:36.923
We gotta bail out.
Police choppers inbound.

01:22:46.891 --> 01:22:48.726
Black Wasp, take out the truck!

01:22:59.654 --> 01:23:02.031
Troy, you all right? Let's go!

01:23:06.661 --> 01:23:08.329
Cops! Cops!

01:23:31.519 --> 01:23:32.645
He's coming back!

01:23:35.481 --> 01:23:37.316
Stay down, Jordan!

01:24:04.969 --> 01:24:07.763
- How do you know what you're doing?
- I don't know!

01:25:07.406 --> 01:25:08.574
Hold on!

01:25:10.785 --> 01:25:12.453
Look out!

01:25:21.754 --> 01:25:23.255
Look out!

01:25:28.052 --> 01:25:30.137
Hold on!

01:25:48.239 --> 01:25:50.992
- Don't let me go, Lincoln!
- I got you!

01:25:51.158 --> 01:25:53.160
- Don't let me go!
- I got you.

01:25:56.080 --> 01:25:58.332
- Don't drop me, Lincoln!
- I got you!

01:25:58.541 --> 01:26:00.501
- Don't drop me!
- I got you.

01:26:04.005 --> 01:26:05.965
Hold on, Lincoln! Pull me!

01:26:06.549 --> 01:26:08.008
Pull me!

01:26:08.968 --> 01:26:11.095
Climb up!

01:26:14.098 --> 01:26:19.103
If there's no way to get our fugitives
quietly, you need to take them out.

01:26:22.356 --> 01:26:26.944
I see our targets about 70 stories up.
They're on top of the building logo.

01:26:30.614 --> 01:26:32.116
Tough day.

01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:34.201
Let's roll.

01:26:35.911 --> 01:26:38.080
L.A.P.D.! Get away from the window!

01:26:42.668 --> 01:26:44.253
Jay, you got them?

01:26:45.421 --> 01:26:47.506
Right there, right there! Get them!

01:26:55.848 --> 01:26:58.767
Stay there! Damn it! Stay down!

01:26:59.518 --> 01:27:01.020
Come on!

01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:06.734
I'm gonna swing around to get a shot.

01:27:13.407 --> 01:27:14.617
He's coming back.

01:27:30.799 --> 01:27:31.884
Oh, no.

01:27:35.763 --> 01:27:38.224
Hang on. It's coming off the building.

01:28:21.934 --> 01:28:23.602
Jesus must love you!

01:28:23.769 --> 01:28:26.772
That was the craziest mess I ever seen!
Come on, girl.

01:28:27.231 --> 01:28:29.525
I know Jesus loves you.

01:28:39.702 --> 01:28:42.204
Can you keep a secret, doc?

01:28:42.371 --> 01:28:43.914
Why, yes, of course.

01:28:44.081 --> 01:28:46.333
There is something going on
around here.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:49.753
- Something you may not even know.
- What is it?

01:28:49.962 --> 01:28:55.009
Well, I'm not sure
that the contamination is real.

01:28:55.217 --> 01:28:57.136
- Why do you think that?
- Okay.

01:28:57.302 --> 01:29:03.058
Lincoln told me that he found
a flying bug in Sector Six.

01:29:03.225 --> 01:29:06.770
Right. And I think that might be why
he thought he could leave.

01:29:06.937 --> 01:29:09.440
Have you told anyone else about this?

01:29:09.648 --> 01:29:13.444
No. But I'm gonna do some digging.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.

01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:16.196
And when I do,
I'll share my information with you.

01:29:16.363 --> 01:29:17.990
Thank you.

01:29:18.282 --> 01:29:19.742
I wanna be helpful.

01:29:19.908 --> 01:29:22.202
- I like it here.
- Good.

01:29:22.411 --> 01:29:24.955
But I really wanna look
into the lottery too.

01:29:25.122 --> 01:29:27.875
- Something's wrong there.
- Yeah.

01:29:28.250 --> 01:29:29.877
You know...

01:29:30.043 --> 01:29:32.880
...you were one of the first
of the Echo generation.

01:29:33.088 --> 01:29:34.673
You're very smart.

01:29:35.174 --> 01:29:37.468
- Yeah.
- I remember when I first came here.

01:29:40.387 --> 01:29:42.765
A survivor, just like you.

01:29:42.931 --> 01:29:45.559
One of the first, in fact.

01:29:45.768 --> 01:29:48.437
It's natural, even healthy,
to question the world.

01:29:49.146 --> 01:29:53.066
Well, you might say it's only...
Only human.

01:29:55.819 --> 01:29:57.780
That burns!

01:30:00.157 --> 01:30:03.577
Get me a list of all the Echos
in active population.

01:30:21.386 --> 01:30:23.764
I saw his address. Tom Lincoln.

01:30:24.306 --> 01:30:26.767
We'll go there when the rain stops.

01:30:27.476 --> 01:30:30.646
- It'll be okay when we find him.
- Okay.

01:30:36.193 --> 01:30:39.029
That little boy looked like me.

01:30:42.282 --> 01:30:44.493
His mom's gonna die, isn't she?

01:30:45.869 --> 01:30:47.579
I don't know.

01:30:50.541 --> 01:30:51.833
You're lying.

01:30:59.758 --> 01:31:01.677
It's cold.

01:31:51.977 --> 01:31:54.730
- Go in.
- I can't.

01:31:55.814 --> 01:31:57.190
- I'll go in.
- Jordan.

01:31:57.691 --> 01:31:59.234
Jordan!

01:32:02.821 --> 01:32:04.531
Hello?

01:32:07.617 --> 01:32:09.327
Hello?

01:32:57.167 --> 01:32:58.794
Lincoln!

01:33:15.727 --> 01:33:17.938
Oh, my God.

01:33:20.315 --> 01:33:23.026
My name is Lincoln Six Echo.

01:33:23.193 --> 01:33:25.779
I'm your insurance policy.

01:33:40.377 --> 01:33:43.880
And what are you doing in my house?

01:33:48.552 --> 01:33:50.262
Sir. Sir.

01:33:51.179 --> 01:33:52.722
You need to see this.

01:33:52.889 --> 01:33:54.933
It's... It's...

01:33:55.976 --> 01:33:57.102
It's beautiful.

01:33:57.519 --> 01:33:59.771
This is the scan of Six Echo
three years ago...

01:33:59.938 --> 01:34:02.607
...before we integrated him
into the agnate population.

01:34:02.774 --> 01:34:05.151
This is his synaptic scan
from a few days ago.

01:34:05.318 --> 01:34:07.028
See how much
the memory's grown.

01:34:07.237 --> 01:34:10.532
It's like he's experienced 30 years,
not three, which is impossible.

01:34:10.699 --> 01:34:14.619
Or maybe this is scarring from
a cortical infection that we didn't...

01:34:14.786 --> 01:34:18.873
An infection can't teach you Latin.
Nor how to fly.

01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:27.591
They are memories.

01:34:29.968 --> 01:34:31.761
But they're not his.

01:34:33.763 --> 01:34:36.224
They belong to his sponsor.

01:34:36.641 --> 01:34:38.268
I've seen you before.

01:34:39.644 --> 01:34:42.522
<i>- I've seen you in Maxim, Esquire...
- Maxim?</i>

01:34:43.481 --> 01:34:45.734
They're men's magazines.

01:34:46.151 --> 01:34:50.822
Pictures of women with little,
tight, short...

01:34:51.239 --> 01:34:52.490
Stories too.

01:34:52.657 --> 01:34:55.243
Anyway, you are very popular.

01:34:57.912 --> 01:34:59.539
There we are.

01:35:01.124 --> 01:35:04.586
- What is that?
- Looks like some kind of thermal im...

01:35:07.547 --> 01:35:09.215
Boy, your skin is so soft.

01:35:10.633 --> 01:35:12.344
Did you know?

01:35:17.349 --> 01:35:21.019
- I put some clothes out for you upstairs.
- Thank you.

01:35:21.186 --> 01:35:24.064
No, thank you.

01:35:33.615 --> 01:35:35.742
I keep expecting to wake up.

01:35:36.159 --> 01:35:37.952
I thought I was taller.

01:35:38.828 --> 01:35:42.248
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
Come here.

01:35:43.333 --> 01:35:45.877
She is unbelievable.

01:35:46.044 --> 01:35:48.046
How is it you've been around
three years...

01:35:48.213 --> 01:35:51.132
...and get the kind of woman
I haven't found my whole life?

01:35:51.299 --> 01:35:52.592
Give me that.

01:35:52.759 --> 01:35:56.137
She found me. She's my best friend.

01:35:56.513 --> 01:35:59.682
- Why do we sound different?
- I'm from Scotland.

01:35:59.849 --> 01:36:01.935
"I'm from Scotland."

01:36:02.102 --> 01:36:04.771
Hey, look. You're creeping me out
enough without that.

01:36:04.938 --> 01:36:06.356
"Without that."

01:36:06.523 --> 01:36:10.068
No, really, cut it out. That's enough.

01:36:10.318 --> 01:36:12.987
Yeah, that is enough. I'm sorry.

01:36:13.822 --> 01:36:15.615
Like a freak show.

01:36:15.782 --> 01:36:17.742
Yeah, it's weird.

01:36:20.537 --> 01:36:22.080
So you build boats?

01:36:22.247 --> 01:36:26.084
Yeah. Well, I design them.
I draw them. Yeah, yeah.

01:36:26.251 --> 01:36:27.585
Here.

01:36:27.794 --> 01:36:31.172
I started off with cars, motorcycles,
experimental designs.

01:36:32.632 --> 01:36:34.509
Anything that blew my hair back.

01:36:34.717 --> 01:36:36.678
Kind of a speed freak.
Petrol-head.

01:36:36.845 --> 01:36:40.265
Motorcycles. It's weird.
I feel like I've seen these before.

01:36:40.431 --> 01:36:42.392
Yeah, it's something I've always done.

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.769
I never dreamt it would make me rich.

01:36:44.978 --> 01:36:49.274
<i>- What's "renovatio"?
- Renovatio in Latin means "rebirth."</i>

01:36:49.774 --> 01:36:51.651
Subtle, eh?

01:36:52.151 --> 01:36:55.780
Look. I have cirrhotic hepatitis...

01:36:55.947 --> 01:36:58.783
...a parting gift from God
for all my philandering.

01:36:59.576 --> 01:37:01.035
What?

01:37:01.411 --> 01:37:03.830
Lots and lots of sex.

01:37:05.290 --> 01:37:08.209
- Sex?
- Sex with...

01:37:09.043 --> 01:37:10.878
You've ne... You're a virgin?

01:37:12.589 --> 01:37:15.008
You're kicking around with her
and you're a virgin?

01:37:17.844 --> 01:37:20.513
Okay, I'm not gonna spoil the surprise.

01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:22.432
Boy, are you in for a treat.

01:37:22.599 --> 01:37:26.519
Look, my doctor said that my liver will
start failing within the next two years.

01:37:31.190 --> 01:37:34.569
I'm not good at all this shite, you know?
Confessions and regrets.

01:37:38.531 --> 01:37:43.578
Look. There are people who are
following us, trying to kill us.

01:37:43.745 --> 01:37:45.830
The reason we came is
we need your help.

01:37:46.039 --> 01:37:49.375
- Help you do what?
- To show people what the institute does.

01:37:50.126 --> 01:37:52.962
I'm looking at you in the face,
and I don't believe it.

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:57.508
Who is that guy? I know him.
Is he the community announcer?

01:37:57.717 --> 01:37:59.218
He's the President of America.

01:37:59.677 --> 01:38:02.180
- He has a clone.
- He's an absolute idiot.

01:38:02.347 --> 01:38:03.931
Yeah, I never liked him either.

01:38:04.140 --> 01:38:06.768
- Do a lot of people see this?
- The news? A lot.

01:38:07.352 --> 01:38:11.147
If we can get on there together, people
will see, and they'll know the truth.

01:38:11.314 --> 01:38:16.402
So we both just waltz down to NBC
and see if they can slot us in?

01:38:16.569 --> 01:38:21.115
This might not mean anything to you,
but there are thousands of us.

01:38:21.282 --> 01:38:24.702
Everyone we've ever known
is gonna die in that place.

01:38:31.209 --> 01:38:32.752
Help us.

01:38:35.630 --> 01:38:38.674
All right. Let me just get
my shoes, okay?

01:38:57.777 --> 01:39:00.196
Tom, hurry up!

01:39:03.991 --> 01:39:05.660
Merrick Institute.

01:39:06.994 --> 01:39:08.704
<i>Merrick Biotech. How may I help you?</i>

01:39:08.871 --> 01:39:10.706
<i>- This is client Tom Lincoln.
- Hi.</i>

01:39:11.124 --> 01:39:13.584
Could you get someone
who can explain to me...

01:39:13.751 --> 01:39:17.296
...why my insurance policy is
sitting downstairs on my fucking sofa?!

01:39:18.089 --> 01:39:20.550
<i>- Can you hold, please?
- Sure.</i>

01:39:31.894 --> 01:39:35.898
I'm sorry to keep you both waiting.
I was getting myself organized.

01:39:36.107 --> 01:39:38.234
Okay, shall we go? Are you ready?

01:39:46.993 --> 01:39:48.828
- Something's wrong.
- What?

01:39:51.247 --> 01:39:53.165
His eyes are lying.

01:39:53.332 --> 01:39:55.001
The same as yours do.

01:39:55.626 --> 01:39:57.128
- You stay here.
- No, don't...

01:39:57.336 --> 01:39:58.713
Shall we?

01:39:59.130 --> 01:40:01.507
- Yeah.
- Is everything okay?

01:40:01.757 --> 01:40:04.719
Yeah. She's gonna stay here
in case they don't believe us.

01:40:05.219 --> 01:40:08.180
- Come on, we'll all go. It'll be good.
- No, she's gonna stay.

01:40:14.812 --> 01:40:15.897
Good luck.

01:40:16.063 --> 01:40:17.189
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:40:29.744 --> 01:40:32.580
- Do you like it?
- Yeah.

01:40:32.747 --> 01:40:35.583
- I'll drive.
- No. I'll drive.

01:40:35.750 --> 01:40:37.585
No, really.

01:40:37.752 --> 01:40:41.464
- Do you know how?
- Yeah, I taught myself.

01:40:41.631 --> 01:40:43.466
But you don't know the way.

01:40:43.633 --> 01:40:45.885
Well, then you can show me.

01:40:48.763 --> 01:40:50.473
Well, be careful.

01:40:50.640 --> 01:40:56.854
This is a V12 '09 Caddy.
750 horsepower, $500,000 car.

01:40:59.815 --> 01:41:01.275
Put your thumb on that.

01:41:04.236 --> 01:41:06.697
You were worth every penny.
We even have the same finger prints.

01:41:06.864 --> 01:41:08.908
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting directions.

01:41:09.075 --> 01:41:11.744
<i>Hello, Mr. Lincoln.
Where would you like to go?</i>

01:41:11.911 --> 01:41:15.122
<i>- KNBC news studio.
- One moment, please.</i>

01:41:15.289 --> 01:41:17.792
Thanks for doing this.

01:41:17.958 --> 01:41:21.879
That's all right. I'd like to think
you'd do the same thing if you were me.

01:41:25.549 --> 01:41:27.218
How much did I cost?

01:41:27.551 --> 01:41:28.886
Five million dollars.

01:41:29.303 --> 01:41:32.306
- Is that a lot?
- It's a small price to pay to cheat death.

01:41:48.989 --> 01:41:50.616
That's a red.

01:41:50.825 --> 01:41:53.077
- It's a red. Red! Stop the car!
- What? Why?

01:41:53.285 --> 01:41:55.371
It's a red light! Stop the car!

01:41:58.749 --> 01:42:00.209
What's the matter?

01:42:00.418 --> 01:42:03.129
You wanker! It's a red light! Stop!
It means stop!

01:42:03.295 --> 01:42:05.631
- Sorry, I didn't know.
- You said you could drive.

01:42:05.965 --> 01:42:09.343
Well, I do know how to drive.
I just don't know what the lights mean.

01:42:16.225 --> 01:42:18.144
I'm sorry. I'm not ready to die.

01:42:21.981 --> 01:42:23.524
Me neither!

01:42:28.279 --> 01:42:29.989
Go, go, go!

01:42:31.615 --> 01:42:33.075
What are you doing? Stop!

01:42:33.284 --> 01:42:34.535
- No.
- Stop the car now!

01:42:44.378 --> 01:42:45.588
I'll shoot. Stop the car.

01:42:45.754 --> 01:42:47.631
- No!
- Yes!

01:42:58.225 --> 01:43:00.519
There's cars coming at us
in all directions!

01:43:20.956 --> 01:43:22.917
They're shooting my car.

01:43:23.584 --> 01:43:26.462
They've shot the engine.
They've shot my engine!

01:43:27.254 --> 01:43:29.214
Oh, God. My nose!

01:43:54.073 --> 01:43:55.407
Where are you going, eh?

01:44:01.538 --> 01:44:03.624
- Get up, get up!
- Let go of me!

01:44:05.542 --> 01:44:07.419
- Get off me!
- Come on, get up.

01:44:07.628 --> 01:44:09.755
- Let me go!
- Get up!

01:44:10.297 --> 01:44:13.509
No, no, no. Don't shoot him.
I need him. I need him.

01:44:19.723 --> 01:44:23.060
No, don't shoot! He's my clone!

01:44:27.314 --> 01:44:29.566
- I'm Tom Lincoln!
- What?

01:44:29.733 --> 01:44:33.654
No, I'm Tom Lincoln!
He's lying. Shut up!

01:44:34.154 --> 01:44:36.073
I own you!

01:44:36.990 --> 01:44:39.451
He's the... I'm Tom Lincoln!

01:44:39.618 --> 01:44:42.162
Don't point the gun at me,
you fricking idiot!

01:44:42.788 --> 01:44:45.791
- He's the clone. Look at him!
- I'm not a clone! I'm Tom!

01:44:45.999 --> 01:44:48.710
No, I'm Tom! He's lying!
Point it at him!

01:44:48.877 --> 01:44:50.963
- No. I'm not.
- Shut up!

01:44:51.171 --> 01:44:54.133
Shut up! You're a clone! Shut up!

01:44:54.591 --> 01:44:57.094
- I'm Tom Lincoln!
- Don't, don't...

01:45:04.518 --> 01:45:05.853
Oh, shit.

01:45:33.797 --> 01:45:35.257
Close.

01:45:42.639 --> 01:45:46.768
Do you think it's strange that
my insurance policy just tried to kill me?

01:45:46.935 --> 01:45:49.980
I find this whole operation strange.

01:45:50.147 --> 01:45:51.940
Where's the woman?

01:45:52.357 --> 01:45:55.569
She said she was going out of state...

01:45:55.986 --> 01:45:57.946
...to look for her sponsor.

01:45:58.113 --> 01:46:01.950
You've been witness
to certain trade secrets.

01:46:02.117 --> 01:46:07.164
You mean that they manufacture
human beings who walk, talk and feel?

01:46:07.331 --> 01:46:09.625
That kind of secret?

01:46:10.459 --> 01:46:13.253
Have you talked with
anyone else about this?

01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:14.922
Who would believe it?

01:46:15.255 --> 01:46:17.007
Can I count on that?

01:46:17.216 --> 01:46:19.593
The only thing you can count on...

01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:23.096
...is that people will do
anything to survive.

01:46:23.513 --> 01:46:27.976
I just want to live. I don't care how.

01:46:32.898 --> 01:46:34.524
Thank you.

01:46:35.359 --> 01:46:38.070
Thank you very much. Job well done.

01:46:44.993 --> 01:46:48.038
Jordan? Jordan?

01:46:48.205 --> 01:46:49.998
Stop.

01:46:52.209 --> 01:46:55.462
Hey, Jordan, it's me. It's me.

01:47:14.356 --> 01:47:15.982
It's you.

01:47:42.384 --> 01:47:46.555
- That tongue thing is amazing.
- I know. Open your mouth again.

01:47:48.765 --> 01:47:51.810
- How come we never did this before?
- Shut up.

01:48:15.125 --> 01:48:17.502
The Island is real.

01:48:18.837 --> 01:48:20.172
It's us.

01:48:23.425 --> 01:48:26.261
- How many are affected?
- About half.

01:48:26.428 --> 01:48:29.264
We're seeing the same neural patterns
in all the Echos...

01:48:29.431 --> 01:48:33.435
...plus every subsequent generation:
The Foxtrots, Gammas and Hilos.

01:48:33.602 --> 01:48:37.230
We predicated our entire system
on predictability.

01:48:37.397 --> 01:48:41.693
Six Echo has displayed the one trait
that undermines it:

01:48:41.860 --> 01:48:44.446
Human curiosity.

01:48:45.489 --> 01:48:50.619
So we're now facing
four generations...

01:48:50.785 --> 01:48:53.955
...with the potential
for defiant behavior.

01:48:55.165 --> 01:48:56.958
What are you suggesting?

01:48:57.709 --> 01:48:59.628
A recall.

01:49:00.212 --> 01:49:04.466
Wait. You mean dispose of over
$200 million worth of product?

01:49:04.633 --> 01:49:07.302
- Yes.
- Great.

Mr. Lincoln, you're home.
Aren't you traumatized, sir?

01:49:47.884 --> 01:49:51.388
I had a home invasion once,
where they put the gun to my head.

01:49:51.554 --> 01:49:53.807
I never forgot that.
I shook for two days.

I've got this figured out. I kind of...

01:58:00.918 --> 01:58:04.797
I messed up in one area right down there,
but on the whole it doesn't matter.

01:58:05.297 --> 01:58:07.883

- She's doubtful.

Even if the transplants
are a success...

01:59:00.686 --> 01:59:03.814
...her brain damage may be
too severe for any real recovery.

01:59:03.981 --> 01:59:05.774
You took too long bringing her back.

01:59:05.941 --> 01:59:09.611
So the girl I brought in, you're going
to harvest her, kill her anyway...

01:59:09.778 --> 01:59:12.072
...even though it
won't make any difference?

01:59:12.239 --> 01:59:15.075
That's the privilege our clients
pay for, Mr. Laurent.

01:59:16.243 --> 01:59:18.871
Now, do excuse me,
I have business to attend to.

01:59:21.915 --> 01:59:25.627
You know my father was part
of the Burkinabe rebellion?

01:59:25.961 --> 01:59:29.798
And when he was killed,
me and my brothers were branded...

01:59:32.217 --> 01:59:35.637
...so others would know
we were less than human.

01:59:36.764 --> 01:59:38.891
I've seen and done things
I'm not proud of...

01:59:39.058 --> 01:59:43.812
...but at some point you realize
war is a business.

01:59:49.109 --> 01:59:51.403
So when did killing
become a business for you?

01:59:57.618 --> 02:00:00.788
Oh, it's so much more than that.

02:00:03.540 --> 02:00:07.044
I have discovered the Holy Grail
of science, Mr. Laurent.

02:00:07.252 --> 02:00:08.712
I give life.

02:00:09.379 --> 02:00:11.048
The agnates.

02:00:11.215 --> 02:00:15.135
They're simply tools, instruments.
They have no souls.

02:00:16.220 --> 02:00:18.931
The possibilities are endless here.

02:00:19.098 --> 02:00:22.935
In two years' time, I will be able
to cure children's leukemia.

02:00:23.102 --> 02:00:26.313
How many people on Earth
can say that, Mr. Laurent?

02:00:28.107 --> 02:00:29.942
I guess just you and God.

02:00:33.904 --> 02:00:36.698
That's the answer
you're looking for, isn't it?

02:00:41.954 --> 02:00:44.414
Mr. Whitman has
your check downstairs.

02:00:51.547 --> 02:00:54.758
Looks like single gunshot.

02:00:57.052 --> 02:00:58.387
Oh, no.

02:00:59.721 --> 02:01:01.056
Wrong wrist.

02:01:01.557 --> 02:01:05.477
<i>Dr. Merrick,
the body that just came in...</i>

02:01:05.644 --> 02:01:06.937
<i>... it's the client.</i>

02:01:20.284 --> 02:01:22.744
Issue a security alert!
Lincoln Six Echo!

02:01:27.708 --> 02:01:30.502
Down, down, down!
Move, move!

02:01:43.890 --> 02:01:45.892
There's a disturbance
in the Hologram Room.

02:01:46.059 --> 02:01:47.394
I'm on it.

02:01:49.229 --> 02:01:51.982
I've sent censors to check
a possible attempted breach...

02:01:52.149 --> 02:01:53.984
<i>... in Hologram Control.</i>

02:02:35.150 --> 02:02:37.194
One after another, step into the room.

02:02:37.361 --> 02:02:39.988
If I'm going to The Island,
why did I leave my bag?

02:02:40.155 --> 02:02:41.782
Step right in, thank you.

02:02:42.824 --> 02:02:44.910
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

02:02:45.077 --> 02:02:46.661
Is this the right way?

02:02:46.828 --> 02:02:49.498
Are you new here?
I don't know if this is the way!

02:02:49.664 --> 02:02:51.500
It's going to The Island?

02:02:53.835 --> 02:02:56.463
I'm almost positive that
you're going the wrong way!

02:03:01.259 --> 02:03:02.761
Open the door!

02:03:08.975 --> 02:03:11.311
She said, open the door.

02:03:46.513 --> 02:03:51.268
You could have taken over his life,
but you chose to come back.

02:03:51.476 --> 02:03:54.104
You truly are unique, Six Echo.

02:03:55.021 --> 02:03:57.107
My name is Lincoln!

02:05:16.144 --> 02:05:17.854
I brought you into this world...

02:05:24.402 --> 02:05:26.071
...and I can take you out of it.

02:05:27.305 --> 02:05:33.207
