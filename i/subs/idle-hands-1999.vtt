WEBVTT

02:36.411 --> 02:38.956
Did you blow
the candles out downstairs?

02:41.875 --> 02:42.793
Yeah.

02:45.169 --> 02:46.338
Look at this.

02:46.713 --> 02:50.050
A Thanksgiving cornucopia
made of pie plates and spackle.

02:50.259 --> 02:52.344
What the heck is a cornucopia?

02:52.594 --> 02:54.555
lt's like a horn of plenty.

02:55.681 --> 02:57.265
Oh, dear, can't it wait?

02:57.474 --> 03:00.018
We just finished decorating
for Halloween.

03:04.064 --> 03:06.191
-Well, good night.
-Night.

03:26.546 --> 03:27.796
Go look!

03:42.770 --> 03:45.521
Just a prank, that's all. Anton.

03:47.942 --> 03:51.069
Our little Scooter would
never do something like that.

03:51.486 --> 03:53.239
Quit calling him that baby name.

03:53.448 --> 03:57.868
Anton would not scoot his behind
off the couch if the house was on fire.

03:58.076 --> 04:01.662
God knows he didn't help me
with the Halloween decorations.

04:05.250 --> 04:08.754
Did you hear that?
l heard something downstairs.

04:09.171 --> 04:11.297
Well, the dog's out in the yard.

04:11.590 --> 04:14.051
lt's probably just the cat.

04:17.678 --> 04:19.139
Well, go see!

05:16.864 --> 05:18.824
Hey, Bones.

05:28.208 --> 05:29.459
Gary?

05:57.779 --> 05:59.364
Anton?

06:18.425 --> 06:20.427
Gary, you said you--

06:22.638 --> 06:24.848
The house could burn down!

06:45.577 --> 06:46.411
Wake up!

06:47.454 --> 06:49.998
Anton, is that you?

07:19.611 --> 07:22.740
If you'd like to make a call,
hang up and try again.

07:22.948 --> 07:26.952
If you need help, hang up
and then dial your operator.

08:30.182 --> 08:32.477
Hey, Mom! We're out of milk!

08:38.440 --> 08:41.193
Mom, we're out of dog food!

09:01.463 --> 09:03.423
Murder in Bolan.: Aa Special Report.

09:03.674 --> 09:07.052
Four bodies have been found.
The killer is still at large.

09:07.594 --> 09:09.054
Bolan is gripped with fear.

09:09.304 --> 09:11.597
The killings spread
from a postal route...

09:11.806 --> 09:15.228
... to the bowling alley and
now to our own Burger Jungle.

09:15.436 --> 09:17.437
With Halloween only one day away...

09:17.646 --> 09:21.400
...Bolan officials have set
a 9 p.m. curfew for all teenagers.

09:45.299 --> 09:46.550
Hey. What's up, man?

09:46.884 --> 09:48.927
-What's up with you?
-l'm dry.

09:49.177 --> 09:52.389
-So?
-So why don't you bring me a dimer?

09:52.598 --> 09:55.851
This ain't Domino's, you lazy bitch.
Come over and get it.

09:56.101 --> 09:58.395
Come on, man. l'm comfortable.

10:00.189 --> 10:01.356
Hello?

10:19.875 --> 10:21.835
What's up, Anton?

10:24.213 --> 10:26.089
Nice outfit!

10:35.600 --> 10:38.977
Yeah? lf your mom had teeth,
she wouldn't suck dick so well.

10:39.186 --> 10:40.562
What's your point?

10:42.523 --> 10:43.607
What's up, Anton?

10:44.650 --> 10:46.235
How's it going, brother?

10:46.653 --> 10:48.319
Nice boxers.

10:49.905 --> 10:51.323
Pass the chronic.

10:51.658 --> 10:54.117
l'm sorry, man.
This bong is cashed.

10:54.368 --> 10:56.453
You said he was holding.

10:56.995 --> 10:59.289
l didn't say what l was holding.

11:06.213 --> 11:07.130
That's messed up.

11:07.381 --> 11:11.635
l hear if you combine nutmeg and
oregano, you can get pretty wasted.

11:12.219 --> 11:13.846
All you do is smoke pot...

11:14.054 --> 11:15.430
...and watch TV all day.

11:15.681 --> 11:18.560
Don't get me wrong.
That's what life is all about.

11:18.810 --> 11:22.104
But don't you think you should
have some ambition, a goal?

11:22.563 --> 11:25.606
Yeah. l mean,
my dream life would be...

11:26.316 --> 11:30.737
...to lie around and watch TV
while some hot broad delivers me food.

11:31.320 --> 11:33.699
Until your parents
kick your oily ass out.

11:35.242 --> 11:37.369
l haven't seen my parents
in a few days.

11:37.786 --> 11:40.330
Maybe they're dead.
Party at Anton's.

11:40.664 --> 11:41.914
What are you doing?

11:42.124 --> 11:44.877
With a killer loose,
you can't rule out murder.

11:45.127 --> 11:46.128
What killer?

11:46.461 --> 11:47.921
Don't you watch the news?

11:48.338 --> 11:49.840
l hate that fucking show.

11:50.132 --> 11:52.675
Our little town is
in the national spotlight.

11:52.968 --> 11:54.511
Local mailman, iced.

11:54.761 --> 11:57.222
Barmaid at the bowling alley, iced.

11:57.472 --> 11:59.266
You haven't heard about the twins?

11:59.933 --> 12:02.477
They were jerking off
in the milkshake-maker again?

12:02.811 --> 12:07.025
lced times two. Last night, when
they were working at Burger Jungle.

12:07.524 --> 12:08.984
Damn.

12:11.820 --> 12:13.488
Anton, here comes your woman.

12:15.281 --> 12:17.409
He's got serious problems.

12:27.044 --> 12:30.547
Molly's lived across the street
for, like, what, ever?

12:30.756 --> 12:33.217
Tell her about your
obsession with her.

12:33.467 --> 12:37.387
-Start by telling her your name.
-Yeah, man. She's waiting for you.

12:37.638 --> 12:39.224
She's not waiting for me.

12:39.473 --> 12:43.477
Would you stop being such a puss
and go, like, ask her to the dance?

12:43.852 --> 12:44.853
What dance?

12:45.103 --> 12:47.814
lf you'd been to school recently,
you'd know.

12:48.065 --> 12:49.734
Halloween thing in the gym?

12:49.943 --> 12:52.486
9:00 curfew?
No trick-or-treating allowed?

12:52.777 --> 12:54.905
Dumb-ass dance is the only option.

12:55.156 --> 12:56.156
You guys going?

12:56.406 --> 12:59.326
Hell, no. Can you see us
in stupid-ass costumes?

12:59.576 --> 13:01.078
Grooving to Hanson and Jewel?

13:01.328 --> 13:03.872
What do we look like,
total losers, man?

13:06.625 --> 13:08.168
l see your point.

13:10.963 --> 13:12.422
She dropped her lyrics book.

13:12.631 --> 13:16.134
She'll catch you reading that
over her shoulder in biology.

13:16.385 --> 13:19.346
Her songs are badass.
She's like a poet or something.

13:19.847 --> 13:24.017
Go bring it back to her.
Be like a knight in shining armour.

13:24.268 --> 13:28.438
She'd be all grateful, invite me in,
offer me a drink, l'd accept.

13:28.730 --> 13:30.232
She'd rip your clothes off...

13:30.482 --> 13:33.485
...and make sweet love to you,
Red Shoe Diary-style.

13:34.987 --> 13:37.030
-Right.
-Could happen.

13:37.614 --> 13:39.740
Just go talk to her, man!

13:40.242 --> 13:43.078
Maybe she'll think you're funny
or something.

13:43.996 --> 13:45.162
You know what?

13:45.706 --> 13:47.040
l think l'm going to.

13:47.332 --> 13:49.543
You want to borrow some pants, chief?

13:50.169 --> 13:51.545
First impressions and all.

13:52.129 --> 13:53.047
You're a bud.

13:56.300 --> 13:57.718
Think he's gonna do it?

13:59.762 --> 14:00.929
So you gotta reach.

14:03.932 --> 14:06.018
You're getting Cheezy Poofs everywhere.

14:06.226 --> 14:08.312
You gotta open your mouth, man.

14:09.897 --> 14:11.607
Lookie what l found.

14:12.106 --> 14:13.274
l thought you were dry.

14:13.567 --> 14:14.485
l guess not.

14:17.112 --> 14:18.280
Fire me up.

14:53.982 --> 14:55.609
These are great.

15:11.375 --> 15:12.918
My book!

15:13.919 --> 15:15.087
Thank you so much...

15:15.629 --> 15:17.089
...for returning it.

15:41.113 --> 15:43.406
You're certain this is the right man?

15:43.699 --> 15:46.451
Well, l'll tell you,
Sister Liquor--

15:47.327 --> 15:48.996
That's LeCure.

15:49.496 --> 15:52.417
-Debi's fine.
-All right, Sister Debi.

15:52.666 --> 15:54.418
He's right here.

16:01.508 --> 16:02.676
lt's gone!

16:03.468 --> 16:04.553
Shit!

16:05.220 --> 16:06.847
Missed it again.

16:10.308 --> 16:11.894
Where did it go?

16:28.577 --> 16:30.078
Beaver.

16:38.420 --> 16:39.838
Bolan.

16:45.677 --> 16:47.304
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

17:00.150 --> 17:01.735
Holy shit!

17:45.654 --> 17:46.654
Don't move!

17:47.114 --> 17:48.448
Roll over!

17:48.866 --> 17:50.201
Roll over!

17:53.954 --> 17:54.955
Anton Tobias.

17:55.832 --> 17:58.208
You got a reason
for prowling around here?

17:58.458 --> 17:59.376
l live here.

17:59.626 --> 18:01.920
Since when is it illegal
to grocery shop?

18:02.337 --> 18:04.005
Hey, l know you guys.

18:04.798 --> 18:07.718
You guys were seniors
when l was a freshman.

18:08.009 --> 18:09.761
Let's talk about high school.

18:09.970 --> 18:13.098
You and your stoner friends
zipping around on skateboards.

18:13.347 --> 18:15.058
Thought you were too cool for us.

18:15.559 --> 18:18.728
Did you even once invite us
to get high behind the gym?

18:19.563 --> 18:20.564
You were dorks.

18:27.362 --> 18:28.739
Either of you holding?

18:29.031 --> 18:30.032
What?

18:30.240 --> 18:33.328
l'm desperate. l know you can
get in the evidence room--

18:33.619 --> 18:37.039
You asshole!
You're trying to score from a cop?

18:37.331 --> 18:40.584
That's it.
Complete personal-effects search.

18:43.378 --> 18:44.296
What's this?

18:44.546 --> 18:47.006
Stupid, that's an asthma inhaler.

18:49.927 --> 18:51.428
Empty your pockets, boy.

18:51.678 --> 18:52.763
They're not my pants.

18:53.180 --> 18:54.181
Let's go!

19:00.854 --> 19:02.356
George found a new home.

19:04.775 --> 19:06.485
What have we here?

19:07.276 --> 19:08.529
Officer?

19:10.072 --> 19:12.074
Smells like marijuana to me.

19:12.324 --> 19:13.325
Write it up, Ruck.

19:13.617 --> 19:14.701
What? lt's empty.

19:15.285 --> 19:17.912
You can't cite me
for possession of a baggie.

19:20.916 --> 19:22.292
Littering.

19:22.543 --> 19:24.211
Maximum fine.

19:26.255 --> 19:28.048
Two hundred dollars.

19:29.967 --> 19:30.968
Right.

21:58.407 --> 22:00.617
Oh, shit! The killer's here!

22:01.327 --> 22:03.161
The killer's in my house!

22:34.359 --> 22:35.694
Okay, Dukey.

22:36.904 --> 22:39.865
Everything's gonna be okay.
Come on, come on.

22:42.992 --> 22:45.037
Everything's going to be fine.

22:45.413 --> 22:46.955
Yes, it is.

23:09.144 --> 23:10.562
All right, boy.

23:15.651 --> 23:17.152
He's not dead!

23:28.289 --> 23:30.289
Duke! Come on, lay down!

23:30.541 --> 23:31.708
Get down, Duke!

23:33.628 --> 23:34.795
All right.

23:43.221 --> 23:45.430
Hold on, Duke. Hold on.

23:47.057 --> 23:49.101
Where's the phone?

23:57.442 --> 23:59.027
Run, Duke, run!

24:00.446 --> 24:01.280
He's under the bed!

24:14.960 --> 24:16.128
Mom?

24:20.632 --> 24:21.717
Dad?

24:40.611 --> 24:42.322
What's the matter?
Bad shrooms?

24:42.529 --> 24:44.907
You got a fever? Here you go.

24:45.449 --> 24:47.034
l'm going to show you.

24:55.542 --> 24:57.085
Oh, man!

24:59.004 --> 25:02.424
l love this video. l didn't think
they could show it anymore.

25:03.718 --> 25:04.551
Guys!

25:06.470 --> 25:08.055
Someone killed my parents!

25:08.305 --> 25:09.473
This is the best part.

25:13.352 --> 25:14.521
Shake them, baby.

25:18.190 --> 25:19.107
Look! Look!

25:21.110 --> 25:22.528
-Shit!
-Yeah, you see?

25:27.491 --> 25:28.575
Mr. Tobias?

25:28.951 --> 25:29.952
Miss T.?

25:33.872 --> 25:38.210
ls this some kind of Halloween gag?
Your parents always go all out.

25:41.297 --> 25:44.173
What the fuck are you doing?
That's my dad!

25:44.423 --> 25:47.302
CPR, man. l saw it on Baywatch.

25:56.311 --> 25:57.771
Check it out.

26:01.566 --> 26:02.985
A clue.

26:42.524 --> 26:44.902
''Ant''? They were killed by ants?

26:45.152 --> 26:47.154
Please, don't be stupid.

26:47.404 --> 26:48.989
Do you have an evil aunt?

26:50.824 --> 26:51.992
Holy shit!

26:56.538 --> 26:57.624
Are those ears?

26:58.540 --> 26:59.791
Ear rings?

27:00.375 --> 27:01.376
They're both lefts.

27:03.295 --> 27:05.005
You know what that means.

27:06.131 --> 27:07.883
Feldstein twins.

27:25.776 --> 27:27.986
The killer was wearing your shirt.

27:32.282 --> 27:34.117
The killer was wearing me.

27:38.413 --> 27:39.873
l'm the killer.

27:42.793 --> 27:45.504
l'm gonna call 91 1 .

27:46.421 --> 27:47.672
What's the number?

27:53.929 --> 27:56.139
There's something wrong
with my friend.

27:56.390 --> 27:59.101
l think he took
some nutmeg or something.

28:03.063 --> 28:04.897
Mick, buddy.

28:05.649 --> 28:08.318
-l would remember something like that.
-You would.

28:08.652 --> 28:10.487
l'm not the killer. You know?

28:10.737 --> 28:14.407
Yeah, l know. But if O.J.
could get off, then l'm sure--

28:16.076 --> 28:17.452
Do you want a beer?

28:17.703 --> 28:19.079
-No, thanks.
-You sure?

28:37.764 --> 28:39.016
Talk to me!

28:42.978 --> 28:45.023
What the hell is happening to me?

28:52.195 --> 28:53.530
Pnub, man.

28:54.364 --> 28:55.866
l didn't do it.

28:57.701 --> 29:00.830
Okay, l did it.
But it was an accident.

29:01.039 --> 29:03.332
l can't believe
you told me to smoke that shit!

29:03.749 --> 29:07.503
Okay, Anton.
l have to leave now.

29:08.169 --> 29:10.255
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

29:28.273 --> 29:30.984
lt's the basement!
You can't get out that way!

29:43.915 --> 29:45.540
Why are you doing this?

29:45.748 --> 29:47.084
l don't know!

29:48.086 --> 29:49.586
lt's me, Pnub! Your buddy!

29:50.962 --> 29:53.590
l know who you are.
l don't want to hurt you.

29:53.841 --> 29:54.925
Then don't!

29:57.635 --> 29:58.888
lt's not me!

29:59.137 --> 30:00.305
lt's my hand!

30:00.597 --> 30:02.974
lt's like l have no control
over my hand!

30:09.231 --> 30:11.608
l don't know how long
l can hold it. Run!

30:11.817 --> 30:12.985
Get out of my way!

30:13.277 --> 30:14.111
Just go!

30:17.322 --> 30:20.075
lt's going to be okay.
l won't tell anybody.

30:20.367 --> 30:21.452
l swear.

30:22.035 --> 30:23.411
Everything will be cool.

30:23.662 --> 30:24.663
Everything will be...

30:37.594 --> 30:39.136
...cool.

31:19.593 --> 31:21.094
What have l done?

31:22.971 --> 31:24.641
What have l done?

32:18.068 --> 32:19.737
Get out of here, Bones!

32:21.362 --> 32:22.530
Git!

32:40.340 --> 32:41.425
Bones?

32:51.351 --> 32:52.769
Here, kitty, kitty.

33:23.717 --> 33:25.928
Aren't you a little old
for ding-dong ditch?

33:28.597 --> 33:30.390
Sorry about your bush.

33:34.729 --> 33:36.354
No problem.

33:40.026 --> 33:42.402
What were you doing out there anyway?

33:47.699 --> 33:49.993
Jesus, look at you!

33:54.081 --> 33:55.749
l was looking for my cat.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.251
We got in a fight.

33:58.252 --> 33:59.920
You sure got your ass kicked.

34:00.504 --> 34:02.172
l did okay.

34:04.007 --> 34:07.344
So you ran and hid in my bush.

34:11.223 --> 34:12.850
l shouldn't be here.

34:13.350 --> 34:14.976
l'm not myself today.

34:15.893 --> 34:17.855
l'm someone completely different.

34:18.981 --> 34:20.732
You're so shy.

34:20.983 --> 34:22.150
lt's okay. l get it.

34:22.777 --> 34:25.987
So let's skip this chickening-out,
sneaking-around stage.

34:26.237 --> 34:29.283
No, you don't understand. l'm--

34:33.830 --> 34:36.290
Do you want to come inside and talk?

34:45.799 --> 34:49.721
You never gave me a chance to thank you.
That book is important to me.

34:54.516 --> 34:55.684
So...

34:56.435 --> 34:59.605
...nothing cooler than
a chick bass-guitar player.

35:00.898 --> 35:02.983
Especially one that writes
her own lyrics.

35:03.233 --> 35:04.776
You read them?

35:06.612 --> 35:09.823
l couldn't help looking in the book.
They're amazing.

35:10.074 --> 35:12.743
Look, l even got
my favourites memorized.

35:12.992 --> 35:14.745
Devil girl with nothing to lose

35:14.995 --> 35:19.374
She got wind in her hair
Aand gum on her shoes

35:22.544 --> 35:24.379
l was 1 3 when l wrote that.

35:24.630 --> 35:26.048
Yeah, well...

35:26.673 --> 35:27.758
...they're amazing.

35:28.091 --> 35:29.343
Thanks.

35:45.107 --> 35:47.486
l should not be here, Molly.

35:47.736 --> 35:51.573
Safer in here than on the streets.
There's a killer out there.

35:53.325 --> 35:57.078
That's exactly what l'm saying.
l'm dangerous.

35:57.579 --> 35:58.580
Oh, yeah?

35:58.872 --> 36:00.832
How dangerous?

36:02.835 --> 36:04.002
l'm not kidding.

36:04.294 --> 36:06.213
l've done stuff, you know?

36:17.140 --> 36:18.976
l'm impressed.

36:19.226 --> 36:23.355
l never would've thought you'd have
the balls to just grab me like that.

36:24.940 --> 36:26.192
Me either.

37:19.077 --> 37:20.704
You're kinky.

37:22.289 --> 37:23.665
That's me.

37:40.682 --> 37:42.976
Move it, people! Let's go!

37:43.267 --> 37:45.354
Some of us are
on serious missions here.

37:46.104 --> 37:49.691
There's evil out there,
and I gotta kick its ass!

37:57.492 --> 38:01.411
Shit, my parents are home.
We'll have to pick this up later.

38:01.663 --> 38:05.332
My parents might take offense to some
bloody boy banging their daughter.

38:05.541 --> 38:06.708
Tomorrow.

38:07.126 --> 38:09.336
-You want to see me?
-Come by at 7.

38:10.671 --> 38:15.175
The curfew's annihilated our options,
but we can go to the dance.

38:15.843 --> 38:18.136
l thought you said
the streets weren't safe.

38:19.471 --> 38:20.638
l'll protect you.

38:49.334 --> 38:50.794
Dearly beloved...

38:51.920 --> 38:55.007
...we're gathered here today
because you're all dead.

38:55.841 --> 38:57.551
And it's my fault.

38:58.886 --> 39:00.804
Mom, Dad...

39:01.764 --> 39:03.974
...what can l say? l mean...

39:04.600 --> 39:06.643
...you brought me into this world...

39:06.894 --> 39:10.814
...you put a roof over my head,
you fed me until l killed you.

39:12.567 --> 39:17.070
lf you look at it that way, l haven't
been a good son, but l'm really...

39:17.404 --> 39:19.489
...really, really sorry.

39:19.780 --> 39:21.700
And wherever you are...

39:22.743 --> 39:25.787
...l just want you to forgive me...

39:26.288 --> 39:28.415
...because l'm gonna try to change.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.172
Mick...

39:35.464 --> 39:36.882
...Pnub, guys....

39:38.259 --> 39:41.929
You guys were the greatest.
l'm never going to forget...

39:42.137 --> 39:47.267
...the way we sat around all day,
watched TV and got really stoned.

39:47.684 --> 39:50.063
And all those other times
where we just....

39:54.024 --> 39:56.151
l guess that's all we did.

40:01.490 --> 40:02.740
Amen.

40:16.797 --> 40:18.631
Over here.

40:20.259 --> 40:21.844
Anton, help me.

40:23.345 --> 40:26.558
Come on, man.
l can't breathe down here.

40:33.480 --> 40:35.607
Anton, can you hear me?

40:37.067 --> 40:38.235
Yeah, man, Mick.

40:38.528 --> 40:40.571
Now get me out of here.

40:41.780 --> 40:42.948
You're dead.

40:43.198 --> 40:44.033
No, l'm not.

40:44.241 --> 40:47.996
You conked my head pretty good.
l must've been unconscious.

40:50.122 --> 40:52.916
-You think?
-l know, fucker. Now dig me up!

41:03.093 --> 41:04.803
Stay where you are, Mick!

41:46.553 --> 41:47.721
Please don't kill me.

41:50.682 --> 41:51.767
Watch it, man!

42:12.162 --> 42:14.081
What did l take last night?

42:16.375 --> 42:18.502
That dream was intense.

42:20.380 --> 42:21.964
lntense.

42:28.719 --> 42:31.431
-Turn it up. Check it out.
-Yeah, l'm watching.

42:32.807 --> 42:33.642
Did you see?

42:33.934 --> 42:35.102
-Guys!
-That's funny.

42:35.353 --> 42:39.022
Thank God you're alive, because
l had this dream that l killed--

42:45.863 --> 42:47.198
Shit!

42:49.616 --> 42:51.577
Sorry about that thing
with the shovel.

42:52.369 --> 42:54.245
-You're dead.
-Easy, tiger.

42:54.705 --> 42:56.456
Undead, actually.

42:56.707 --> 42:58.917
You said you were unconscious.
You lied.

42:59.168 --> 43:02.838
You killed me, all right?
Try and keep this thing in perspective.

43:03.130 --> 43:06.216
l was bitter about the
getting-killed-by-my-best-friend thing.

43:06.425 --> 43:07.926
But l got over it.

43:21.147 --> 43:22.524
So why you here?

43:22.733 --> 43:24.193
We need a place to kick it.

43:24.443 --> 43:27.237
Don't be selfish.
No one else's parents are dead.

43:27.654 --> 43:30.116
No, not why are you '' here'' here.
l mean...

43:30.408 --> 43:34.077
...are you flesh-eating zombies
back from hell to exact revenge?

43:34.412 --> 43:35.747
ls that it?

43:36.038 --> 43:38.040
Why would we go to hell?

43:38.290 --> 43:39.124
We're not bad.

43:39.374 --> 43:42.877
lt's not like we're good,
but at least we don't kill people!

43:43.295 --> 43:45.255
l didn't kill anybody on purpose.

43:46.006 --> 43:48.049
Yeah, well, we weren't in hell.

43:48.300 --> 43:51.345
There was this bright light
at the end of a long tunnel.

43:51.596 --> 43:54.765
There were all these chicks' voices.
And that music.

43:55.057 --> 43:55.892
Music?

43:56.225 --> 43:58.893
Kind of uncool music, like Enya.

43:59.144 --> 44:00.812
And these chicks were saying...

44:01.063 --> 44:03.899
...'' Come to us.
Come towards the light.''

44:06.611 --> 44:07.986
So what happened?

44:08.320 --> 44:09.863
We figured, fuck it.

44:10.113 --> 44:11.991
l mean, it was really far.

44:18.163 --> 44:20.373
l've got to ask.
What's with the hand?

44:23.043 --> 44:24.878
lt doesn't obey me at all.

44:25.170 --> 44:28.423
The only thing l can come up with is,
it's possessed.

44:29.633 --> 44:32.803
Do you guys know anything
about Satan or evil or...?

44:33.554 --> 44:34.388
No.

44:36.723 --> 44:38.642
But we know somebody who does.

45:11.091 --> 45:12.343
Did you know them well?

45:13.218 --> 45:14.970
Not really.

45:15.387 --> 45:16.471
You?

45:17.473 --> 45:19.600
Yeah, they were great.

45:19.850 --> 45:24.271
l just feel really bad, you know,
because l was always so mean to them.

45:25.439 --> 45:29.276
Like this one time, they asked me
to go on a double-date...

45:29.568 --> 45:33.322
...and l thought they were 'tards,
because there's only one of me.

45:34.031 --> 45:37.034
So l told them to go blow each other.

45:40.454 --> 45:41.455
Did they?

45:47.544 --> 45:48.795
The way you treated them...

45:49.087 --> 45:51.798
...the guilt must be making you feel
like shit inside.

45:52.632 --> 45:53.634
Randy!

45:53.885 --> 45:55.719
You're still in high school?

45:55.969 --> 45:58.597
Yeah, me, l got out
about three years ago.

45:58.847 --> 46:00.224
l need your help.

46:01.225 --> 46:03.602
What are you playing,
a little two-ball?

46:04.562 --> 46:07.773
l gotta talk to you.
There's serious stuff going on.

46:08.023 --> 46:11.610
Anton, can't you see l'm getting
a little action over here?

46:16.281 --> 46:19.785
Oh, man. l can't believe
you cock-blocked me like that.

46:20.035 --> 46:22.080
l thought we were buds.

46:22.829 --> 46:23.663
Randy, wait!

46:24.706 --> 46:26.750
l didn't mean to mess you up.
Listen.

46:27.000 --> 46:28.627
l need your help.

46:32.674 --> 46:33.924
Piss off!

46:50.648 --> 46:52.651
Fresh tomatoes....

46:54.361 --> 46:55.820
Hey! Who are you?

46:56.196 --> 46:58.073
New. Drive-thru duty.

46:58.324 --> 46:59.492
Excuse me.

47:00.951 --> 47:02.035
Sorry.

47:13.380 --> 47:15.257
-Break time.
-All right.

47:16.091 --> 47:18.969
Give me the Big Five with
the Spicy Safari Fries...

47:19.219 --> 47:21.305
...the African Apple Turnover...

47:21.555 --> 47:23.557
...and the Raspberry Rainforest Shake.

47:23.807 --> 47:26.352
Slap some extra mustard
on that Jungle Burger.

47:26.643 --> 47:28.937
Tell me everything you know
about the devil.

47:30.814 --> 47:32.733
Aare you out of your fucking mind?

47:33.817 --> 47:37.237
You listen to satanic music.
You must've picked up something.

47:37.529 --> 47:40.157
Look, it's just music.

47:41.117 --> 47:43.202
Like Mozart and that other fag....

47:44.953 --> 47:45.954
Keep it clean.

47:47.039 --> 47:48.415
Who, Beethoven?

47:48.707 --> 47:51.961
That's the guy. It's just like
their music, only louder.

47:52.211 --> 47:53.754
You gotta know.
l'm desperate.

47:54.004 --> 47:55.339
Oh, man!

47:58.842 --> 48:00.010
Here!

48:00.426 --> 48:01.803
Asshole!

48:05.140 --> 48:08.268
lt's my hand. lt's like it's got
a mind of its own.

48:08.477 --> 48:10.937
lt makes me do things
l don't want it to do.

48:11.688 --> 48:13.023
l used to be like that.

48:13.273 --> 48:15.651
Get into all kinds of stupid shit.

48:15.943 --> 48:17.027
Look, the trick is...

48:17.444 --> 48:19.112
...to keep yourself busy.

48:19.363 --> 48:21.656
That's why l'm always
working on the Ford.

48:21.864 --> 48:23.825
Keeps me out of trouble.

48:24.077 --> 48:27.203
ldle hands are the devil's playground.

48:27.746 --> 48:29.540
Keep my hands busy.

48:30.290 --> 48:33.168
Yeah, that actually makes sense.

48:33.460 --> 48:34.711
Thanks.
You're the coolest.

48:50.143 --> 48:51.728
So do you, like, knit now?

48:51.980 --> 48:55.399
Don't take this the wrong way,
but you look queer doing that.

48:55.649 --> 48:57.734
Randy broke it down for me.

48:58.360 --> 49:01.238
'' ldle hands are the devil's playpen.''
So l'm thinking...

49:01.864 --> 49:04.157
...keep my hands occupied, right?

49:04.532 --> 49:06.910
Man, that saying's not literal.

49:07.160 --> 49:08.495
lt's more like...

49:09.371 --> 49:10.205
...you know....

49:10.831 --> 49:12.082
Metaphorical?

49:12.624 --> 49:13.793
Right.

49:27.097 --> 49:29.016
This is the noise complaint.

49:29.851 --> 49:31.685
Ain't this the Tobias residence?

49:39.484 --> 49:41.862
Holy shit! lt's Anton.
He's the killer!

49:42.111 --> 49:44.406
-l better call for backup.
-Are you crazy?

49:44.698 --> 49:48.285
And let the feds get the credit?
lf we collar him, we'll be heroes.

49:48.535 --> 49:50.162
We can't go in without a warrant.

49:50.412 --> 49:52.623
Piss on the Bill of Rights!
We got just cause.

49:53.874 --> 49:55.125
Freeze!

49:55.376 --> 49:56.628
Yeah, freeze!

50:01.758 --> 50:02.591
Guys...

50:02.925 --> 50:03.842
...what do l do?

50:05.052 --> 50:06.303
l think you--

50:11.600 --> 50:13.977
l was gonna say to do
what they tell you...

50:14.310 --> 50:15.729
...but now l changed my mind.

50:15.979 --> 50:17.606
You should just kill them.

50:19.358 --> 50:20.817
-They're alive!
-They are not!

50:21.026 --> 50:23.238
You shot one in the head!
They're morgue-meat.

50:24.029 --> 50:26.782
Look, guys. l don't want
to kill anybody else.

50:28.535 --> 50:30.661
You don't want to go to jail, though.

50:30.994 --> 50:33.455
Jail. That's it!

50:33.705 --> 50:37.125
They'll throw me in a rubber room.
l can't hurt anybody else.

50:37.376 --> 50:38.710
Cuff me!

50:39.254 --> 50:41.212
Okay. Just...

50:42.965 --> 50:44.676
...drop the knitting needles.

50:45.217 --> 50:48.220
That's not a good idea.
Why don't you just cuff me?

50:48.720 --> 50:51.722
Drop the needles
and put your hands on your head!

50:51.973 --> 50:53.058
l can't!

50:53.559 --> 50:55.687
Put down the needles
and come quietly.

50:55.978 --> 50:58.355
-Cuff me!
-Put the needles down now!

50:58.689 --> 51:00.357
-Cuff me!
-Put them down!

51:00.649 --> 51:02.067
-Put them down!
-Cuff me!

51:32.723 --> 51:33.807
Go, go, Buffalo!

51:37.270 --> 51:38.438
Stop!

51:39.229 --> 51:41.106
l didn't do it. lt was my hand.

51:41.397 --> 51:44.109
lt's like, the knitting
didn't help at all.

51:44.359 --> 51:47.362
l told you that saying
was more, like, metaphorical.

51:56.287 --> 51:58.582
l can't keep doing this!

52:00.501 --> 52:02.044
l'm losing my mind.

52:17.767 --> 52:19.394
Get your head.

52:28.820 --> 52:30.572
No way.

52:31.365 --> 52:33.408
lt's the only thing l can think of.

52:33.741 --> 52:37.120
Once that hand is gone,
how will you cut off the other one?

52:37.372 --> 52:38.705
The left one's a keeper.

52:38.956 --> 52:41.250
l mean, l guess it wasn't idle enough.

52:41.959 --> 52:42.961
Are you sure?

52:44.086 --> 52:48.132
l use it for a lot of things.
l light up, l change the remote...

52:48.674 --> 52:50.759
...l relieve a little tension.

52:51.260 --> 52:53.303
This is the answer. l know it.

52:54.513 --> 52:56.348
Those things won't even cut my bagel.

52:59.393 --> 53:00.477
Shit!

53:07.818 --> 53:08.735
Grab the carver.

53:14.783 --> 53:16.034
Look at me!

53:16.285 --> 53:18.120
l'm Leatherface!

53:20.331 --> 53:21.331
Thanks, Mick.

53:24.627 --> 53:26.587
l'll just use this one.

53:27.921 --> 53:29.423
l can't watch.

53:50.485 --> 53:51.486
You missed.

53:52.614 --> 53:53.614
Pnub...

53:54.740 --> 53:55.824
...bite down.

53:56.200 --> 53:57.534
Don't cut me, man!

54:08.212 --> 54:10.005
You scream like a girl.

54:13.050 --> 54:14.551
What the hell are you doing?

54:18.223 --> 54:20.766
l gotta stop the blood flow.
Don't you watch ER?

54:22.643 --> 54:26.562
Look at that nasty thing.
That's gonna be infected for sure.

54:26.855 --> 54:28.815
You got any antiseptic, Anton?

54:29.066 --> 54:30.068
l don't know.

54:30.359 --> 54:33.320
Pnub's got some in a first-aid kit
in his house.

54:33.612 --> 54:34.696
And burritos.

54:35.406 --> 54:36.865
You'll be okay, buddy.

54:37.114 --> 54:39.661
We'll be back in a sec
to fix you up, Anton.

54:45.999 --> 54:47.000
Catch you on the flip-flop.

55:06.687 --> 55:07.856
Oh, shit!

55:28.876 --> 55:30.793
Anton, are you home?

55:34.591 --> 55:36.800
Don't come in!
Just stay there, okay?

55:37.593 --> 55:39.219
Very funny, Anton.

55:39.469 --> 55:41.013
Stay out there, Molly!

55:41.346 --> 55:43.223
l'm freezing my butt off.

55:58.739 --> 56:00.532
Anton, we're gonna be late.

56:07.706 --> 56:09.458
Anton, l can hear you in there!

56:09.707 --> 56:11.418
Stay outside!

56:12.586 --> 56:14.463
Come on, Anton!

56:21.136 --> 56:23.222
Let's go!
We're gonna be late!

56:35.776 --> 56:37.444
We're gonna miss the band.

56:43.659 --> 56:44.826
Fry!

56:49.957 --> 56:51.207
Gross.

56:51.667 --> 56:53.544
Anton, l'm coming in.

56:58.215 --> 56:59.049
Wait!

57:09.309 --> 57:10.769
You look incredible.

57:10.979 --> 57:12.937
Thanks. But you should've called.

57:13.146 --> 57:16.817
lf you needed more time with your
costume, fine. But l hate waiting.

57:17.192 --> 57:19.570
So what are you supposed
to be, anyway?

57:22.364 --> 57:23.282
l'm...

57:24.074 --> 57:27.287
...a fast-food employee that
cut off his own hand.

57:27.828 --> 57:28.662
Cute.

57:35.711 --> 57:36.713
Come on!

57:40.674 --> 57:42.301
Anton, we're back!

57:43.093 --> 57:46.220
We got antiseptic
and adhesive bandages!

57:46.430 --> 57:48.223
The ouch-free kind!

57:53.145 --> 57:56.648
'' Microwave for three minutes
and enjoy.''

57:57.566 --> 57:59.569
That's really getting on my nerves.

58:10.495 --> 58:12.247
What are you doing?

58:14.374 --> 58:15.292
Could you...?

58:15.627 --> 58:16.710
This way.

58:17.084 --> 58:18.086
Easy.

58:22.049 --> 58:23.841
Yeah. That's better.

58:27.095 --> 58:28.179
All right.

58:33.602 --> 58:34.853
Thanks, man!

58:39.691 --> 58:40.943
Gross!

58:41.693 --> 58:43.695
Maybe we should clean it first.

58:43.903 --> 58:47.950
Hey, yeah! And while we're at it,
we can clean the whole house.

58:48.158 --> 58:49.785
This ain't our mess.

59:09.388 --> 59:13.309
Look, l can't go to the dance yet,
okay? l'm sorry.

59:13.934 --> 59:16.562
My parents will be home
in a few minutes.

59:16.770 --> 59:19.481
lf they see the mess l made,
they'll kill me.

59:20.232 --> 59:22.359
Look, l won't be too long.

59:22.609 --> 59:23.987
l'll meet you there.

59:25.405 --> 59:26.863
ls something wrong?

59:27.071 --> 59:28.824
You need to go there now...

59:29.032 --> 59:33.578
...and you can't stop till you're
inside with everyone else, okay?

59:34.037 --> 59:35.957
You wouldn't stand me up, would you?

59:36.957 --> 59:39.084
Not a chance, babysnakes.

59:47.384 --> 59:49.094
l'll get the next one.

59:56.852 --> 59:58.770
Shit! l bit my tongue.

01:00:06.445 --> 01:00:07.529
That's disgusting.

01:00:11.867 --> 01:00:13.827
l bet l can fix that for you.

01:00:26.130 --> 01:00:27.049
Hold still.

01:00:30.260 --> 01:00:31.595
That's better.

01:00:32.346 --> 01:00:34.264
Burrito, burrito

01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:38.894
Wait, wait! Don't open it!

01:00:40.522 --> 01:00:42.063
l'm sorry, there were only two.

01:00:42.313 --> 01:00:44.691
No! You let the hand out!

01:00:46.527 --> 01:00:48.653
We brought you a first-aid kit.

01:00:50.113 --> 01:00:52.907
-Where did it go?
-What? You mean the hand?

01:00:53.158 --> 01:00:54.243
Of course, the hand.

01:00:56.203 --> 01:00:58.329
Try looking up your ass.

01:01:12.886 --> 01:01:14.054
Damn.

01:01:41.999 --> 01:01:42.833
Hey, foxy.

01:01:44.209 --> 01:01:45.294
Looking for a ball?

01:01:45.502 --> 01:01:49.423
Because l could help you find one
that's the right size for you.

01:01:50.424 --> 01:01:51.508
What the hell?

01:01:51.757 --> 01:01:53.134
Try and keep up.

01:01:53.552 --> 01:01:56.388
l'd be happy to keep up
with you, sweet thing.

01:01:59.725 --> 01:02:01.476
Don't you have a dance to go to?

01:02:02.144 --> 01:02:04.771
That's right.
We gotta do our costumes.

01:02:04.981 --> 01:02:07.441
-You coming, Randy?
-No.

01:02:07.691 --> 01:02:09.651
l think l can find myself a ride.

01:02:09.902 --> 01:02:11.153
All right.

01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:16.408
So what brings you to Bolan?

01:02:18.243 --> 01:02:19.578
You don't want to know.

01:02:20.037 --> 01:02:22.748
No, seriously.
l'm interested.

01:02:22.956 --> 01:02:24.123
Really?

01:02:27.169 --> 01:02:28.712
Here it goes.

01:02:29.671 --> 01:02:33.425
l'm a Druidic priestess sworn
to fight a certain evil force...

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:36.678
...that possesses the laziest
fuckup it can find.

01:02:36.929 --> 01:02:39.556
lt will kill as many people
as possible...

01:02:39.806 --> 01:02:43.060
...and then drag a free soul
into the Netherworld.

01:02:45.436 --> 01:02:47.648
That's some weighty shit there.

01:02:48.106 --> 01:02:49.275
Here's the kicker.

01:02:49.525 --> 01:02:52.945
l have the one thing
that can stop this from happening.

01:02:53.987 --> 01:02:56.949
l just need to find the bastard
whose hand is possessed.

01:02:57.616 --> 01:02:58.701
Weird.

01:02:58.951 --> 01:03:03.121
Earlier today, this guy, Anton,
told me his hand was doing stuff...

01:03:03.372 --> 01:03:05.457
...that he didn't want it to do.

01:03:06.458 --> 01:03:07.918
Don't you fuck with me!

01:03:08.167 --> 01:03:09.795
Ease up, there, kitten.

01:03:10.045 --> 01:03:13.131
l'm telling you the truth.
This guy was freaked!

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:15.259
Show me where he lives.

01:03:28.354 --> 01:03:30.649
Left! Turn left!

01:03:51.962 --> 01:03:54.756
Guys! We gotta go to the dance.

01:03:56.049 --> 01:03:57.509
The hand, it's after Molly.

01:03:58.177 --> 01:04:00.636
Let's check out the dance.
l'll win Best Costume.

01:04:00.888 --> 01:04:03.974
Chicks dig winners.
l'll probably hook up.

01:04:04.225 --> 01:04:08.479
Yeah, because severed heads are
one of the top 1 0 big turn-ons.

01:04:10.272 --> 01:04:12.941
lt kills me to see you stressed out.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:16.403
You cut off your hand
in the interest of others.

01:04:16.652 --> 01:04:17.821
lt's not your problem anymore.

01:04:18.197 --> 01:04:22.033
So what l want you to do
is take a little Anton-time.

01:04:23.242 --> 01:04:25.705
Just relax and kick back, my man.

01:04:26.205 --> 01:04:27.831
No, no. You know what?

01:04:30.542 --> 01:04:31.627
Not this time, okay?

01:04:32.752 --> 01:04:35.215
l'm through with that.
All l do is sit around.

01:04:35.464 --> 01:04:38.132
l veg out, l watch TV,
l smoke pot--

01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:40.969
No Kevin Costner speeches.
Let's just go.

01:04:45.724 --> 01:04:46.808
Come on!

01:04:56.235 --> 01:04:57.694
Let's go! Come on, come on!

01:04:57.904 --> 01:04:59.238
That's him!

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:02.991
-They're getting into my Ford!
-Wait here. He's dangerous.

01:05:03.409 --> 01:05:06.119
Wait.
Don't let him steal my Ford.

01:05:06.370 --> 01:05:08.205
Trust me.
l know what l'm doing.

01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.668
That's lucky.

01:05:13.752 --> 01:05:14.837
Shit.

01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:16.839
Couldn't be automatic.

01:05:17.798 --> 01:05:18.632
Want me to drive?

01:05:18.882 --> 01:05:20.133
No, just shift for me.

01:05:28.308 --> 01:05:29.978
Anton! Wait!

01:05:39.778 --> 01:05:40.864
What was that?

01:05:41.154 --> 01:05:42.155
Who cares?

01:05:54.084 --> 01:05:55.586
Get back here!

01:06:22.988 --> 01:06:25.032
Who's got the barf breath?

01:06:48.347 --> 01:06:50.475
Damn!
lt's hot in here.

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.185
So are you, babe.

01:06:56.688 --> 01:06:59.650
l'm sweating my costume off, Curtis.

01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:04.655
Better?

01:07:18.794 --> 01:07:20.629
Help me get this off.

01:07:40.565 --> 01:07:42.359
Right there.

01:08:23.774 --> 01:08:24.774
lt's here.

01:08:25.694 --> 01:08:27.738
You guys go protect Molly.

01:08:28.071 --> 01:08:29.323
l'll go after the hand.

01:08:32.117 --> 01:08:34.243
-What a waste.
-You didn't like Curtis.

01:08:34.493 --> 01:08:36.330
l'm talking about that ass!

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.372
Well, at least he died happy.

01:09:05.484 --> 01:09:06.902
What's bugging you?

01:09:07.152 --> 01:09:08.569
Just thinking.

01:09:09.321 --> 01:09:10.906
And l know who about.

01:09:11.406 --> 01:09:13.200
Just thought he'd be here by now.

01:09:14.076 --> 01:09:15.661
He'll be here.

01:09:18.121 --> 01:09:20.667
l'll go get some punch.
You want some?

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.085
Okay, l'll be right back.

01:09:48.861 --> 01:09:50.779
You guys look great!

01:09:51.572 --> 01:09:53.282
Who did your makeup?

01:09:54.824 --> 01:09:58.036
-l guess Anton did.
-Based on my design, though.

01:09:59.079 --> 01:09:59.996
You want to dance?

01:10:00.288 --> 01:10:01.206
Hell, yeah!

01:10:04.418 --> 01:10:06.503
-We should find Molly.
-Quit being a skirt.

01:10:06.711 --> 01:10:10.215
We'll look for her while we dance.
There's plenty of chicks here.

01:10:10.965 --> 01:10:13.343
-Careful, it's on kind of loose.
-Cool!

01:10:38.702 --> 01:10:42.122
Don't put me on hold again.
l want to talk to your supervisor.

01:10:42.581 --> 01:10:43.582
What?

01:10:44.458 --> 01:10:46.293
Yes, of course.

01:10:49.796 --> 01:10:52.758
What's taking so long?
ls this the supervisor?

01:10:53.925 --> 01:10:56.553
What do you mean
my credit card is no good?

01:10:57.012 --> 01:10:59.473
Well, you must have
the wrong number.

01:11:00.348 --> 01:11:03.101
No, it's 8-4-6-8.

01:11:10.275 --> 01:11:11.443
That's good.

01:11:12.653 --> 01:11:15.363
l think you've been a bad girl...

01:11:16.323 --> 01:11:19.743
...and l want to spank you
with my ruler.

01:11:21.662 --> 01:11:23.372
Oh, yes, that's nice.

01:11:23.789 --> 01:11:25.040
That is nice.

01:11:27.668 --> 01:11:28.919
Now l'm hot.

01:11:29.671 --> 01:11:31.046
l'm hot.

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:36.009
You got me so hot, it's like
l can feel you touching me.

01:11:40.223 --> 01:11:42.432
l can feel you touching me.

01:12:10.419 --> 01:12:11.503
Bingo!

01:12:24.516 --> 01:12:26.810
Come on! We got to find Anton!

01:12:28.103 --> 01:12:29.771
And kick his ass!

01:12:49.750 --> 01:12:51.168
Are you Anton?

01:12:51.418 --> 01:12:54.296
lf you're a teacher,
we'll discuss my attendance later--

01:12:54.505 --> 01:12:56.548
l found you!
My name is Debi LeCure.

01:12:56.798 --> 01:12:59.176
l know what's happening.
l could stop it.

01:13:00.093 --> 01:13:00.929
Really, how?

01:13:03.430 --> 01:13:04.264
Die!

01:13:16.401 --> 01:13:17.653
Yeah, fuck him up, Debi!

01:13:19.279 --> 01:13:21.240
The host of evil must die!

01:13:26.578 --> 01:13:28.664
lsn't that knife
a little extreme, kitten?

01:13:41.134 --> 01:13:45.931
You're not going anywhere, evil-hosting
fuck-stick. Nobody touches my Ford!

01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:47.224
Come on, Debi.

01:13:47.474 --> 01:13:48.392
Give him what for.

01:13:48.725 --> 01:13:50.227
Wait, wait! l'm not a host.

01:13:50.561 --> 01:13:51.728
Okay, look.

01:13:52.019 --> 01:13:54.106
The evil was in my hand, all right?

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:57.901
l cut it off. Okay?

01:13:59.904 --> 01:14:00.654
Oh, shit!

01:14:00.904 --> 01:14:02.239
You let it loose?

01:14:02.489 --> 01:14:04.283
That was probably a mistake.

01:14:04.533 --> 01:14:07.661
No kidding. And now it's
after my girlfriend.

01:14:07.870 --> 01:14:09.705
-You got a girlfriend?
-l gotta stop it.

01:14:09.955 --> 01:14:12.791
-lt's out for blood.
-That ain't all it's out for.

01:14:13.041 --> 01:14:15.962
lf your girl's the one it's after,
then at midnight...

01:14:16.211 --> 01:14:17.921
...it's taking her to hell.

01:14:18.172 --> 01:14:19.673
Hell?

01:14:21.092 --> 01:14:23.802
lt's not even 9:00 yet.
We got some time.

01:14:25.095 --> 01:14:25.929
lt's actually...

01:14:27.222 --> 01:14:30.225
...six minutes till midnight,
druid time.

01:14:31.143 --> 01:14:32.561
Druid time.

01:14:32.895 --> 01:14:33.728
Right.

01:14:33.979 --> 01:14:34.813
Let's go!

01:14:43.572 --> 01:14:44.655
Oh, God!

01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:46.325
That's disgusting.

01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:49.827
Come on, man. You're dead.

01:14:50.078 --> 01:14:53.081
You know, think about it.
lt's illegal.

01:15:17.731 --> 01:15:19.316
Move! Look out!

01:15:25.197 --> 01:15:27.991
Everybody, go home!
There's a psycho killer here!

01:15:38.877 --> 01:15:41.171
l cut off my hand,
and it'll kill you all.

01:15:41.421 --> 01:15:42.923
Get off the stage!

01:15:46.593 --> 01:15:49.053
lt's true.
His hand killed us yesterday.

01:15:49.346 --> 01:15:51.640
Yeah, it sliced me up real good.

01:15:52.057 --> 01:15:54.433
-Molly, you out there?
-Get out of here, kid!

01:15:56.103 --> 01:15:58.730
You had your fun!
Now it's time--

01:16:09.241 --> 01:16:10.241
Shit!

01:16:36.059 --> 01:16:39.564
-God! Did you see that thing?
-l have to get Anton!

01:16:39.813 --> 01:16:42.941
No, screw him!
l mean, he'll be fine!

01:16:45.194 --> 01:16:46.196
Come on!

01:16:48.989 --> 01:16:49.990
ln there?

01:16:50.241 --> 01:16:53.660
You want to stay out here and
get killed as you're trampled?

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.919
l was going to get some.

01:17:02.794 --> 01:17:04.755
l really doubt it.

01:17:11.845 --> 01:17:14.389
Pnub's a lot more creative
than l thought.

01:17:14.597 --> 01:17:16.808
l mean, he's actually kind of cool.

01:17:17.143 --> 01:17:19.853
-He had that costume--
-Maybe we should go faster.

01:17:20.102 --> 01:17:21.772
l don't know if he did it or--

01:17:22.022 --> 01:17:23.816
-Wait, wait!
-What, what--?

01:17:26.318 --> 01:17:27.236
Go!

01:17:37.079 --> 01:17:39.456
Oh, shit! We're trapped in here!

01:17:39.749 --> 01:17:42.292
-lt's going to get me!
-lt's not going to get you!

01:17:42.543 --> 01:17:44.503
lt's not going to get you!

01:17:49.049 --> 01:17:52.260
We can't go through the blade!
We'll be pulverized!

01:17:52.511 --> 01:17:53.929
Give me your shoe!

01:18:24.375 --> 01:18:26.211
What are you going to do?

01:18:28.714 --> 01:18:31.425
No, no.
Oh, God, it's too far!

01:18:31.675 --> 01:18:33.636
l can't drop that far!

01:18:34.636 --> 01:18:36.054
We'll die in this vent!

01:18:36.305 --> 01:18:38.140
-We won't die.
-We'll die here.

01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:42.227
The rats are gonna eat us,
and nobody's gonna find us.

01:18:44.479 --> 01:18:45.855
Okay, we're good.

01:18:49.902 --> 01:18:52.112
-Be careful.
-All right, let's go!

01:18:58.744 --> 01:19:01.871
This would be more comfortable
if your ass wasn't so wide.

01:19:02.121 --> 01:19:04.333
-This is dumb.
-Anton needs our help.

01:19:04.583 --> 01:19:07.753
The best thing about being dead
is zero responsibility.

01:19:08.003 --> 01:19:10.380
That's Tanya. Let's save her.
Come on!

01:19:12.216 --> 01:19:15.719
-Hurry up. She needs me.
-She needs you like a fish needs--

01:19:20.641 --> 01:19:22.559
Okay, this sucks.

01:19:28.649 --> 01:19:30.442
Grab the cord and come down!

01:19:31.109 --> 01:19:33.904
l can't. l can't. l'm scared!

01:19:34.403 --> 01:19:36.073
Do it, Tanya! Come on!

01:19:36.323 --> 01:19:38.158
l can't. lt's here.

01:19:38.408 --> 01:19:40.077
lt's in here. l know it.

01:19:41.453 --> 01:19:43.248
Why'd you pull the rope up?

01:19:44.164 --> 01:19:46.123
l didn't pull the rope up.

01:19:49.294 --> 01:19:51.421
Tanya, where are you?
l can't see you!

01:19:52.089 --> 01:19:53.758
Tanya, talk to me, please!

01:19:54.008 --> 01:19:55.508
Just jump! Just jump!

01:20:00.222 --> 01:20:02.516
Tanya, grab the rope!

01:20:03.851 --> 01:20:04.769
Get it off!

01:20:37.593 --> 01:20:41.346
l'm not going through all this Tanya.
Go back that way.

01:20:42.764 --> 01:20:45.309
-Now you really won't get any.
-lt's unfair.

01:20:45.601 --> 01:20:48.228
You can go back if you want
to get a piece.

01:21:20.052 --> 01:21:21.552
Fucking hand, l got you now!

01:22:00.717 --> 01:22:02.094
Who's your daddy now, bitch?

01:22:03.387 --> 01:22:04.554
Who's your fucking--

01:22:07.934 --> 01:22:09.851
We're here for you.
Don't worry.

01:22:12.230 --> 01:22:13.939
-l made that ashtray!
-Really?

01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:15.524
You let it go again!

01:22:16.024 --> 01:22:16.859
Fuck you, then.

01:22:17.109 --> 01:22:18.736
Fine, then! You know what?

01:22:18.987 --> 01:22:20.779
You aren't crashing at my house.

01:22:21.029 --> 01:22:22.489
Did you guys hear that?

01:22:27.619 --> 01:22:29.288
Help! Help!

01:22:35.169 --> 01:22:36.336
Help me!

01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:47.430
Bet she wins Best Costume.

01:22:48.265 --> 01:22:49.349
Help me!

01:22:53.228 --> 01:22:54.563
The hand's raising the car!

01:22:56.524 --> 01:22:57.774
Help me!

01:22:59.317 --> 01:23:01.320
Don't worry. We got it under control!

01:23:01.571 --> 01:23:02.905
The fucker's got a grip.

01:23:09.453 --> 01:23:10.913
Hurry, please!

01:23:17.252 --> 01:23:20.547
Those auto-shop boys
are true artistes.

01:23:22.508 --> 01:23:24.301
lt's Mighty Joe Bong!

01:23:26.011 --> 01:23:27.095
l needs me spinach.

01:23:31.516 --> 01:23:32.769
l made that.

01:23:33.101 --> 01:23:36.063
The ashtray, l'd almost believe.
But this? No way.

01:23:40.858 --> 01:23:43.237
Molly's about to get squished,
you bastards!

01:23:43.529 --> 01:23:45.989
This is important. For strength.

01:23:58.292 --> 01:23:59.546
There you go.

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:03.215
Now you're taking Anton-time.

01:24:04.007 --> 01:24:07.594
You're getting stoned with
your friends? Unbelievable!

01:24:40.377 --> 01:24:42.296
That's some one-hit shit there!

01:24:43.631 --> 01:24:44.464
Don't worry.

01:24:45.048 --> 01:24:45.883
l'll get you down.

01:25:12.951 --> 01:25:13.785
That's it?

01:25:15.621 --> 01:25:18.789
That's it?
No explosions, no hellfire, no--?

01:25:20.876 --> 01:25:22.252
l'm glad everyone's all right.

01:25:22.503 --> 01:25:24.212
But that was weak.

01:25:24.755 --> 01:25:26.758
Well, my work here is done.

01:25:27.007 --> 01:25:29.801
Time for the ritualistic sex.
You coming?

01:25:31.053 --> 01:25:33.138
You are a pistol.

01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:37.435
Hello? l'm still up here.

01:25:40.729 --> 01:25:41.980
Thanks, Mick.

01:25:43.273 --> 01:25:44.524
You're a bud.

01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:02.292
Come here.

01:26:14.722 --> 01:26:15.639
As usual...

01:26:15.889 --> 01:26:19.268
...marijuana saves
an otherwise disastrous day.

01:26:25.525 --> 01:26:27.651
l never got a hit. Light me.

01:26:38.119 --> 01:26:39.705
Sweet Jesus!

01:26:39.955 --> 01:26:41.456
That wasn't my fault!

01:26:41.708 --> 01:26:44.418
That thing should've come down
a lot slower!

01:26:55.262 --> 01:26:56.722
What the hell.

01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:58.182
Don't forget my bong.

01:26:58.432 --> 01:27:00.434
You did not make that bong.

01:27:00.684 --> 01:27:01.685
l arc welded it.

01:27:01.936 --> 01:27:03.104
You don't take auto shop.

01:27:03.354 --> 01:27:04.812
Fuck you!

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:08.108
You coming, Anton?

01:27:23.874 --> 01:27:25.459
l can't even believe it.

01:27:25.709 --> 01:27:28.170
You blew off heaven
to kick it with me.

01:27:28.378 --> 01:27:29.463
You are the coolest.

01:27:29.671 --> 01:27:33.175
You taking care of me
beats the shit out of heaven.

01:27:33.425 --> 01:27:34.259
Really?

01:27:38.597 --> 01:27:40.098
Time for your meds.

01:27:48.565 --> 01:27:50.859
Guys! You blew off heaven too?

01:27:51.193 --> 01:27:53.570
No, we're your guardian angels.

01:27:54.905 --> 01:27:57.824
Poor thing has delirium.
Visiting hours are over.

01:28:01.119 --> 01:28:02.955
l'll see you tomorrow, okay?

01:28:09.503 --> 01:28:11.964
So the deal is,
we're supposed to monitor you...

01:28:12.214 --> 01:28:14.925
...and make sure you don't revert
to your evil ways.

01:28:15.133 --> 01:28:16.969
But you seem fine now.

01:28:17.219 --> 01:28:20.639
Let's hit the Snack Master in the hall.
You want anything?

01:28:20.889 --> 01:28:23.267
Get me Crunch Nuggets.
They're awesome.

01:28:27.479 --> 01:28:29.231
Thanks, you guys.

01:28:33.111 --> 01:28:34.279
Hit the light.

01:28:43.662 --> 01:28:46.540
Mick! Pnub!
Come guardian me!

01:28:52.546 --> 01:28:55.090
You're right.
Anton screams like a girl.

01:28:55.424 --> 01:28:57.968
Think we should tell him
we painted that?

01:28:58.886 --> 01:29:01.014
Fuck it.
Let's go walk through a nurse.

01:29:01.222 --> 01:29:03.599
Watch it! Some of them are guys.
