Wong Kar-Wai

00:59.324 --> 01:00.382
It is a restless moment.

01:00.591 --> 01:02.320
She has kept her head lowered...

01:02.427 --> 01:04.087
to give him a chance to come closer.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.822
But he could not, for lack of courage.

01:05.930 --> 01:07.557
She turns and walks away.

01:08.599 --> 01:10.760
HONG KONG, 1962.

01:15.473 --> 01:17.407
Eat up. The fish is very fresh today.

01:24.215 --> 01:25.944
Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

01:26.150 --> 01:28.243
Never mind. Let's sit over here.

01:30.722 --> 01:32.485
It's quite late!

01:32.857 --> 01:34.484
I've just finished work.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.691
What should I call you?

01:36.894 --> 01:38.418
You can call me Mrs. Suen.

01:38.629 --> 01:40.460
- And you?
- My husband's name is Chan.

01:40.631 --> 01:43.429
- Call me when you decide.
- I will.

01:44.002 --> 01:45.629
Did you write down my number?

01:45.937 --> 01:46.961
Yes, I did.

01:47.205 --> 01:48.832
Fine, I'll see you out.

01:49.040 --> 01:50.667
- Don't trouble.
- No trouble!

02:02.020 --> 02:03.419
So it's agreed then!

02:03.621 --> 02:04.952
Thank you very much! I should go.

02:05.156 --> 02:06.088
- Fine.
- Bye!

02:06.290 --> 02:07.621
Take care. Good-bye!

02:09.127 --> 02:10.753
You've a room to let?

02:10.961 --> 02:14.659
Sorry, it's just been rented
to that lady.

02:15.233 --> 02:16.291
Thanks anyway.

02:16.501 --> 02:18.435
How many of you?

02:19.203 --> 02:20.864
Just me and my wife.

02:21.572 --> 02:23.164
Why don't you try next door?

02:23.408 --> 02:25.308
They've a vacant room too?

02:25.543 --> 02:30.344
Yes, Mr. Koo's son got married.
His room's empty.

02:30.982 --> 02:31.880
Thank you.

02:32.083 --> 02:33.812
You're too polite. Try asking them.

02:34.018 --> 02:34.950
Thank you.

02:41.559 --> 02:42.651
This way. Come on.

02:42.860 --> 02:44.020
Not that room!

02:44.262 --> 02:45.991
Oops, wrong again!

02:49.567 --> 02:51.296
Careful! Against the wall there.

02:57.708 --> 02:59.198
The little cupboard over there.

02:59.410 --> 03:00.570
Be careful!

03:01.546 --> 03:03.173
Don't break anything!

03:03.414 --> 03:05.382
Not on top of the radio!

03:06.084 --> 03:06.880
Mr. Chow...

03:07.085 --> 03:09.178
you have a lot of stuff for a couple!

03:09.921 --> 03:11.980
- The wardrobe isn't mine.
- Wrong again?

03:12.190 --> 03:13.384
It goes next door.

03:13.591 --> 03:15.582
Okay, next door.

03:16.094 --> 03:20.030
These aren't my shoes!
They must go next door.

03:22.033 --> 03:24.729
What a coincidence!
Moving in on the same day!

03:25.470 --> 03:27.199
Is Mr. Chan here?

03:27.572 --> 03:30.268
He's working abroad.
He'll be back next week.

03:30.942 --> 03:33.035
You should have waited, then.

03:33.644 --> 03:36.204
It's too much for you on your own.

03:36.481 --> 03:39.041
- I can manage.
- I'll ask Amah to help.

03:39.250 --> 03:41.013
No need. I can manage.

03:41.219 --> 03:42.743
What's going on?

03:43.988 --> 03:45.046
Mind that mirror!

03:45.256 --> 03:46.883
Mrs. Chan, I'll leave you to it.

03:53.965 --> 03:56.229
- Those books aren't mine.
- Wrong again?

03:56.434 --> 03:57.867
Never mind. Just leave them there.

03:58.469 --> 04:00.630
Mind how you hang the mirror.
It's fragile!

04:00.838 --> 04:02.465
Are these magazines yours?

04:03.508 --> 04:05.408
Yes, they're my husband's.

04:05.843 --> 04:07.470
He reads Japanese?

04:07.745 --> 04:09.610
A little. His boss is Japanese.

04:09.814 --> 04:11.372
How should I address you?

04:11.582 --> 04:12.640
My husband's name is Chan.

04:12.917 --> 04:14.544
My name's Chow.
I'll leave you in peace.

04:14.752 --> 04:15.980
Thank you, Mr. Chow.

04:16.187 --> 04:17.245
Don't mention it.

04:20.158 --> 04:21.648
I'll ask Mrs. Chan.

04:24.795 --> 04:26.990
Mrs. Chan,
eat with us before you go!

04:27.231 --> 04:30.098
No, thanks.
I must dash to the airport.

04:30.368 --> 04:32.131
- Your husband's coming back?
- Yes.

04:32.336 --> 04:33.997
Then I won't keep you.

04:36.007 --> 04:37.634
- Going out?
- Yes.

04:40.211 --> 04:41.371
Sorry I'm late!

04:41.646 --> 04:42.874
Amah, pour some beer.

04:44.849 --> 04:45.816
Cheers!

04:47.351 --> 04:50.445
Mrs. Chow,
try some Shanghai dishes.

04:50.922 --> 04:53.618
Where is Mrs. Chan off to so late?

04:55.059 --> 04:57.357
Meeting her husband at the airport.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.489
So that's why she looks different.

05:58.155 --> 06:00.555
It's all packed.
Take care on your trip.

06:01.058 --> 06:02.025
I will.

06:05.496 --> 06:08.056
How long this time?

06:08.399 --> 06:10.299
Two to four weeks.

06:11.102 --> 06:15.232
Remember to bring back
two more of those handbags.

06:15.573 --> 06:16.562
Who for?

06:16.774 --> 06:17.798
My boss.

06:18.009 --> 06:19.135
Two of them?

06:19.477 --> 06:21.035
You know why.

06:21.245 --> 06:22.872
Different colors?

06:24.248 --> 06:26.273
The same will do! Who cares?

06:27.351 --> 06:28.648
Whatever!

06:39.797 --> 06:45.167
Mrs. Ho.
Mr. Ho is still in a meeting.

06:45.369 --> 06:48.133
He'll be home late.
Please don't wait to eat.

06:51.175 --> 06:53.234
Yes. We're so busy at the moment.

06:54.845 --> 06:57.780
Yes. I'll ask him to call you
when he gets back.

07:06.724 --> 07:08.453
Did you call my wife?

07:08.659 --> 07:10.957
Yes, I said you'd be back later.

07:11.896 --> 07:13.329
Have you booked the restaurant?

07:13.531 --> 07:14.691
A table for two at 8:00.

07:15.299 --> 07:18.200
Miss Yu called
to say she's on her way.

07:18.969 --> 07:23.497
I'll be back after dinner.
Can I bring you something?

07:23.708 --> 07:25.938
No, thanks. I'll get my own.

07:26.977 --> 07:31.175
Leave when you're ready.
I'll lock up.

07:35.486 --> 07:37.283
- Good evening, Mr. Ho!
- Evening!

07:56.240 --> 07:58.538
- Going out, Mrs. Chan?
- Yes.

08:02.913 --> 08:04.540
Going out so late?

08:04.749 --> 08:06.376
Just getting some noodles.

08:06.851 --> 08:09.251
Amah is making pork soup. Join us.

08:09.453 --> 08:12.479
Thanks, I'm not really hungry.
I just want some air.

08:12.690 --> 08:14.681
You're too polite.

08:14.892 --> 08:16.189
Next time!

08:19.230 --> 08:22.859
They're all starving. We can eat.

08:25.069 --> 08:26.696
Have you spoken to Ming?

08:28.205 --> 08:29.866
So I'll go with someone else!

08:31.642 --> 08:33.405
Just kidding!

08:33.943 --> 08:36.879
I'll be early tonight. See you soon!

08:45.256 --> 08:46.223
Chow!

08:46.590 --> 08:47.557
Coming!

08:54.064 --> 08:58.694
Time to go! Finish it tomorrow!

08:59.136 --> 09:01.468
No, I'm nearly there.

09:01.772 --> 09:02.864
Oh, Ming.

09:03.808 --> 09:06.436
- I need a few days off next month.
- Why?

09:07.344 --> 09:10.370
I promised my wife a trip.
Put in a word for me, will you?

09:11.081 --> 09:13.641
I'll speak to personnel.

09:13.851 --> 09:15.819
But the next lunch is on you.

09:16.020 --> 09:17.112
I will.

09:17.488 --> 09:18.648
Thanks, Ming!

09:21.459 --> 09:22.619
It's ready!

09:22.993 --> 09:25.223
No, it'll switch itself off!.

09:26.797 --> 09:28.890
I told you, it's not ready!

09:30.000 --> 09:32.798
A rice cooker!
It's yours, Mrs. Koo?

09:33.304 --> 09:37.331
No, it's beyond us!
It's Mrs. Chan's.

09:40.444 --> 09:41.934
My husband brought it from Japan.

09:42.146 --> 09:43.909
I wanted to show Mrs. Koo
how good it is.

09:44.682 --> 09:45.979
Now it's ready!

09:56.227 --> 10:00.857
Mrs. Chan, could Mr. Chan
get me one next time?

10:01.065 --> 10:02.157
No problem!

10:02.666 --> 10:05.328
Mr. Chow, you should get one too!

10:05.636 --> 10:09.367
Your wife's so often late home.

10:11.242 --> 10:12.971
I couldn't trouble Mr. Chan.

10:13.210 --> 10:15.144
It's just neighborly, isn't it?

10:16.680 --> 10:19.877
It's no trouble!
I'll ask him to buy another next time.

10:20.684 --> 10:21.946
Thank you!

10:31.161 --> 10:33.721
Let's try the rice.

10:35.533 --> 10:38.502
Mr. Chan, sorry to trouble you
about the rice cooker.

10:38.702 --> 10:40.363
It was really no trouble.

10:41.839 --> 10:44.364
How much do I owe you?

10:44.742 --> 10:46.403
Your wife has already paid me.

10:46.777 --> 10:47.744
Really?

10:47.945 --> 10:49.640
She didn't tell you?

10:50.180 --> 10:51.704
She's been working late shifts.

10:51.916 --> 10:53.907
Often I'm asleep when she gets back.

10:54.118 --> 10:55.676
It must be hard for her.

10:55.920 --> 10:56.852
Yes.

10:57.421 --> 10:59.013
Mrs. Chan isn't back yet?

10:59.223 --> 11:02.351
She'll be back soon.
You need to talk to her?

11:02.893 --> 11:04.758
A friend needs to go to Singapore.

11:04.962 --> 11:07.487
I wonder if she could get
a cheap ticket for him.

11:07.698 --> 11:09.222
I'll ask when she gets back.

11:10.701 --> 11:12.601
I'm bothering you too much.

11:12.803 --> 11:15.670
Don't mention it. We're neighbors!

11:16.574 --> 11:18.269
I'll leave you in peace.

11:24.715 --> 11:25.909
Looking for me?

11:26.216 --> 11:29.117
Damn right. Where've you been?

11:29.787 --> 11:31.015
What's up?

11:31.722 --> 11:35.624
Mrs. Chan called.
You left a hat at her office.

11:35.826 --> 11:38.624
I meant to!
I wanted an excuse to go back.

11:39.096 --> 11:40.723
I know your tricks!

11:41.932 --> 11:43.365
She's married.

11:43.601 --> 11:45.535
I know, that's why I left.

11:45.736 --> 11:48.728
Otherwise I'd move in next door.

11:48.939 --> 11:52.705
If your wife wasn't so attractive,
she'd be a worried woman!

11:55.579 --> 11:57.206
I'm not like you.

11:59.416 --> 12:01.145
Please call Mrs. Chan for me.

12:01.585 --> 12:02.984
I'll pick up the hat tomorrow.

12:03.187 --> 12:04.552
And take her to lunch!

12:05.422 --> 12:06.548
Dream on!

12:06.757 --> 12:09.590
She'll take the hat home.
I'll bring it in tomorrow.

12:10.461 --> 12:13.123
You're kidding!
Some buddy you are!

12:13.330 --> 12:15.457
Tell you what,
let's go pick her up now!

12:17.301 --> 12:19.826
She should be off work by now.
We can go together!

12:20.471 --> 12:21.995
I don't have time for this.

12:22.206 --> 12:23.138
Chow!

12:23.340 --> 12:25.900
Yes! Get out of here, I'm busy.

12:26.143 --> 12:28.839
Then I'll wait at your place.

12:30.547 --> 12:31.844
Ping!

12:40.157 --> 12:41.920
Mr. Chow, is Mr. Koo in?

12:42.226 --> 12:45.127
He's out...
Forgot to buy the paper again?

12:45.396 --> 12:46.761
That's right, I'll stop by later.

12:46.964 --> 12:49.194
- Maybe I can find it for you.
- Thank you.

13:00.244 --> 13:01.939
- This one?
- Yes.

13:03.313 --> 13:06.805
I always loved those serials.
Hated to miss an episode.

13:07.084 --> 13:08.779
Really? You liked them too?

13:08.919 --> 13:12.377
I even thought of writing one!

13:12.823 --> 13:14.222
Why didn't you?

13:14.558 --> 13:16.856
I couldn't get started,
so I gave up.

13:17.194 --> 13:19.355
I wasn't born
to write martial arts stories!

13:19.563 --> 13:21.827
But you can borrow
from my collection anytime.

13:22.032 --> 13:25.024
Not now. Maybe another time.
Thanks.

13:25.235 --> 13:26.202
You're welcome!

13:34.044 --> 13:35.671
What is it? Mrs. Chan!

13:36.380 --> 13:38.575
I just want to return these
to Mr. Chow. Is he in?

13:38.882 --> 13:40.850
He's been away for a few days.

13:41.051 --> 13:41.983
Why?

13:42.619 --> 13:44.246
They had a quarrel.

13:44.955 --> 13:49.324
Leave them with me.
I'll pass them back to him.

13:50.360 --> 13:51.327
Thank you.

14:00.070 --> 14:01.162
Forget it!

14:02.106 --> 14:04.870
I'm on a replacement shift tonight.

14:06.977 --> 14:08.604
Talk to you later.

14:12.783 --> 14:14.410
No need to pick me up!

14:17.387 --> 14:19.014
She's already left.

14:19.823 --> 14:23.054
Really? I was going
to take her out for supper.

14:23.761 --> 14:26.423
Didn't she tell you
she was off early today?

14:26.764 --> 14:29.358
She never remembers to tell me.

14:31.468 --> 14:33.197
Maybe she's home by now.

14:34.271 --> 14:35.431
I'll be off, then.

14:35.639 --> 14:36.867
Okay, bye!

17:01.251 --> 17:02.183
Hello!

17:14.998 --> 17:16.192
You're out of hospital!

17:16.400 --> 17:18.960
Don't mention hospital!
Lend me $30!

17:19.403 --> 17:20.369
What for?

17:20.737 --> 17:22.728
You gotta help me save face!

17:22.940 --> 17:24.031
What's the big deal?

17:24.241 --> 17:25.935
It's Ah Hoi's fault.

17:26.143 --> 17:29.237
He gave me a racing tip,
said it was a sure thing.

17:29.980 --> 17:34.212
Before they'd taken out the stitches...

17:34.418 --> 17:36.716
I bet everything I had.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.547
And I lost my shirt!

17:38.855 --> 17:40.618
What did you expect?

17:41.358 --> 17:43.724
I thought it was my lucky day.

17:43.961 --> 17:45.656
Anyhow, I had only $2 left.

17:46.330 --> 17:49.663
So I went to the whorehouse.

17:50.033 --> 17:51.967
You were in no shape for sex!

17:52.169 --> 17:54.160
I thought it would improve my luck.

17:56.173 --> 17:58.641
What would $2 buy you?

17:59.676 --> 18:03.112
I'm Kwai-fei's regular.
She gives me credit.

18:03.947 --> 18:05.278
You can have it on credit?

18:05.482 --> 18:08.974
I left my I D card and said
I'd be back to redeem it.

18:09.486 --> 18:11.818
I thought a few dollars
would be easy to rustle up.

18:12.189 --> 18:14.282
But so far nothing.
I'm way overdue.

18:14.491 --> 18:15.116
So?

18:15.459 --> 18:17.290
Four Eyes was there yesterday.

18:17.494 --> 18:19.860
Saw her waving my I D
around in front of everyone.

18:20.063 --> 18:21.325
So embarrassing!

18:21.665 --> 18:23.292
Anyway, lend me $30!

18:29.806 --> 18:31.433
This is all I can spare.

18:32.209 --> 18:34.541
I need $10 for myself.

18:37.414 --> 18:39.109
Pay you back next month.

18:39.983 --> 18:42.213
- Let's have a late snack.
- What?

18:42.519 --> 18:45.488
All I've had today
is some won-ton noodles.

18:45.722 --> 18:47.383
Let me finish writing this first.

18:50.861 --> 18:52.829
I'm not sure
I should tell you this--

18:53.663 --> 18:54.561
What?

18:54.765 --> 18:57.233
I saw your wife
in the street yesterday.

18:57.534 --> 18:59.161
So what?

19:00.570 --> 19:03.835
She was with some guy.

19:08.545 --> 19:10.172
Probably a friend.

19:12.549 --> 19:14.915
Just thought you should know.

19:21.191 --> 19:24.786
Mr. Ho's still in a meeting.
He says he can't manage dinner.

19:26.997 --> 19:29.022
Yes, we're very busy now.

19:33.103 --> 19:34.195
I will.

19:34.938 --> 19:36.872
I'll ask Mr. Ho to call.

19:42.512 --> 19:44.810
- Have you called Miss Yu?
- Yes, I have.

19:45.515 --> 19:46.482
What did she say?

19:46.683 --> 19:48.583
Asks you to call her later.

19:48.785 --> 19:51.413
And Mrs. Ho says she's ready
to cut her birthday cake.

19:51.621 --> 19:52.883
She wants you to hurry home.

19:53.090 --> 19:55.581
- Did you get me a present for her?
- Yes, this.

19:55.792 --> 19:57.657
- What is it?
- A scarf.

19:58.128 --> 20:00.824
- I think Mrs. Ho will like it.
- Thank you.

20:01.398 --> 20:02.729
And here's your change.

20:02.933 --> 20:06.391
I'm always troubling you.
Use it for bus fare.

20:06.970 --> 20:09.564
Why don't you dine with us tonight?

20:09.806 --> 20:12.775
Thank you, I've already
planned to see a film tonight.

20:12.976 --> 20:14.671
Then I won't keep you.

20:14.945 --> 20:17.846
Tomorrow will be quiet.
Take the morning off.

20:28.225 --> 20:29.852
Are you going out tonight?

20:32.329 --> 20:34.058
Don't forget your keys.

20:34.264 --> 20:36.528
All the neighbors
are dining out tonight.

20:37.167 --> 20:40.864
I have a lot to do here.
I'll be late.

20:56.253 --> 20:57.880
What is it, Mrs. Chan?

20:58.288 --> 20:59.448
I heard voices,

20:59.656 --> 21:01.920
I thought Mr. and Mrs. Koo
were back.

21:02.325 --> 21:05.158
Not yet. Anything I can help with?

21:06.930 --> 21:09.296
No, I just wanted a chat.

21:10.433 --> 21:12.492
- Are you alone?
- Yes, I am.

21:16.039 --> 21:17.734
You're back early today!

21:18.441 --> 21:21.308
I came back to rest.
I'm not feeling well...

21:23.446 --> 21:25.971
What is it?
I have some medicines...

21:26.950 --> 21:29.510
Don't trouble yourself,
I'll sleep it off.

21:31.888 --> 21:33.947
In that case...
I'll leave you in peace.

21:40.130 --> 21:41.757
It was your wife.

21:44.501 --> 21:46.264
Have you spoken to your wife yet?

21:47.571 --> 21:49.436
Then we shouldn't meet anymore.

22:37.087 --> 22:38.748
Any news from the Philippines?

22:39.222 --> 22:40.348
Yes, a telex.

22:40.557 --> 22:42.491
There's a typhoon,
so the ship's still docked.

22:43.293 --> 22:48.162
Please inform Chan
that the shipment may be delayed.

22:48.565 --> 22:50.192
Ask if that's a problem.

22:53.903 --> 22:56.895
Your wife rang.
You don't need to pick her up.

22:57.107 --> 22:58.768
She's playing mahjong with Mrs. Lau.

22:58.975 --> 23:01.205
She'll meet you
at the restaurant at 5.30.

23:04.881 --> 23:06.439
And there's a gift from Miss Yu.

23:06.883 --> 23:08.180
She was here?

23:08.385 --> 23:10.114
No, she had it sent over.

23:10.387 --> 23:13.550
She says she'll dine alone
since it's your birthday.

23:13.990 --> 23:16.356
Please phone her
when you have a moment.

23:18.461 --> 23:20.952
- I'll get you another coffee.
- Thank you.

23:44.254 --> 23:45.312
Thank you.

23:51.027 --> 23:52.654
That tie looks good on you.

23:53.263 --> 23:57.495
You noticed?
It's much like the old one.

23:59.102 --> 24:01.434
You notice things
if you pay attention.

24:13.817 --> 24:15.079
I'll be off now.

24:15.285 --> 24:18.482
If Chan has a problem,
let me know at the restaurant.

24:18.688 --> 24:19.347
I will.

24:19.556 --> 24:20.818
Why did you change your tie?

24:21.024 --> 24:22.685
The new one was too showy.

24:22.892 --> 24:24.587
I should stick with my own.

24:24.794 --> 24:26.455
Don't forget to lock up.

26:13.336 --> 26:16.237
By the way,
haven't seen your husband lately.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.734
He's abroad now,
on company business.

26:20.243 --> 26:22.803
That's why I see you
at the noodle stall.

26:24.113 --> 26:25.808
I don't like cooking for myself.

26:27.016 --> 26:29.382
Haven't seen your wife
lately either.

26:30.420 --> 26:33.412
Her mother's ill.
She's at home with her.

26:35.091 --> 26:36.786
That explains it.

26:37.694 --> 26:38.820
Good night!

26:39.496 --> 26:40.326
Good night!

26:40.964 --> 26:42.591
Mrs. Chan, I'm glad you're back!

26:42.799 --> 26:44.562
It's raining so hard!

26:44.767 --> 26:46.667
I was going to look for you
with an umbrella.

26:47.136 --> 26:48.103
You're too kind.

26:48.304 --> 26:49.498
Amah, who is it?

26:49.606 --> 26:50.368
It's Mrs. Chan.

26:50.473 --> 26:51.405
Mrs. Suen!

26:52.008 --> 26:56.308
Caught in the rain?
I said you could eat with us!

26:57.180 --> 26:59.341
Next time... Enjoy your game.

27:01.784 --> 27:06.619
Her husband's always away.
It's sad to see her so lonely.

27:06.823 --> 27:10.850
She dresses up like that
to go out for noodles?

27:21.738 --> 27:23.933
Mr. Chow!
What are you doing here?

27:24.574 --> 27:26.439
Just calling Mrs. Koo to the phone.

27:28.077 --> 27:29.704
You're late back.

27:29.979 --> 27:31.674
I went to the pictures.

27:32.315 --> 27:33.942
I'll be going.

27:41.324 --> 27:42.348
Hello?

27:43.159 --> 27:44.786
Yes, please hold on.

27:45.028 --> 27:47.053
- Who is it?
- It's for Mrs. Chan.

27:58.074 --> 28:01.840
It must seem odd to ask you out,
but I want to ask something.

28:02.245 --> 28:04.509
That handbag I saw you with
this evening...

28:04.714 --> 28:06.147
Where did you buy it?

28:07.250 --> 28:08.911
Why do you ask?

28:10.920 --> 28:13.980
It looked so elegant.
I want to get one for my wife.

28:17.293 --> 28:19.227
Mr. Chow, you're so good
to your wife!

28:20.396 --> 28:23.695
Not really! My wife is so fussy.

28:24.067 --> 28:27.161
Her birthday is some days away.
I don't know what to get her.

28:31.975 --> 28:34.205
Could you buy one
for me to give her?

28:35.144 --> 28:38.443
Maybe she wouldn't want one
just exactly the same.

28:40.583 --> 28:43.017
You're right, I didn't think of that.

28:44.654 --> 28:46.281
A woman would mind.

28:46.723 --> 28:49.521
Yes, especially since
we're neighbors.

28:52.328 --> 28:54.091
Do they come in other colors?

28:56.766 --> 28:58.734
I'd have to ask my husband.

28:59.435 --> 29:00.459
Why?

29:01.471 --> 29:04.634
He bought it for me
on a business trip abroad.

29:05.241 --> 29:06.902
They aren't on sale here.

29:10.947 --> 29:12.437
Then never mind.

29:19.322 --> 29:20.289
Actually...

29:20.490 --> 29:22.583
I want to ask you something too.

29:24.694 --> 29:25.558
What?

29:26.996 --> 29:28.623
Where did you buy your tie?

29:31.634 --> 29:33.295
I don't know where it came from.

29:33.703 --> 29:35.933
My wife buys all my ties.

29:36.539 --> 29:37.597
Really?

29:40.143 --> 29:45.604
She bought this one
on a business trip abroad.

29:46.115 --> 29:47.742
It's not on sale here.

29:49.118 --> 29:50.813
What a coincidence!

29:53.556 --> 29:54.523
Yes.

30:00.730 --> 30:02.027
Actually...

30:04.400 --> 30:07.164
my husband has one just like it.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.430
He said it was a gift from his boss.

30:11.007 --> 30:12.702
So he wears it every day.

30:17.914 --> 30:20.212
And my wife has a bag
just like yours.

30:21.417 --> 30:22.850
I know,

30:23.052 --> 30:24.178
I've seen it.

30:26.823 --> 30:28.950
What are you getting at, actually?

30:41.204 --> 30:43.502
I thought I was the only one
who knew.

31:02.425 --> 31:04.325
I wonder how it began.

31:20.443 --> 31:23.935
It's late.
Won't your wife complain?

31:24.947 --> 31:28.007
She's used to it. She doesn't care.

31:30.553 --> 31:31.850
And your husband?

31:32.655 --> 31:34.623
He must be asleep by now.

31:38.227 --> 31:39.956
Shall we stay out tonight?

31:47.637 --> 31:49.628
My husband would never say that.

31:52.608 --> 31:54.269
What would he say?

31:54.911 --> 31:57.141
Anyhow, he wouldn't say that.

31:57.980 --> 31:59.777
Someone must have made
the first move.

32:00.416 --> 32:02.111
Who else could it be?

32:07.590 --> 32:10.582
It's late.
Won't your wife complain?

32:11.360 --> 32:13.920
She's used to it. She doesn't care.

32:15.364 --> 32:16.956
And your husband?

32:17.834 --> 32:19.825
He must be asleep by now.

32:41.457 --> 32:43.118
I can't say it.

32:47.530 --> 32:49.157
I understand.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.491
After all, it's already happened.

32:54.170 --> 32:56.536
It doesn't matter
who made the first move.

33:00.810 --> 33:02.641
Do you really know your wife?

33:32.775 --> 33:34.367
You order for me.

33:34.877 --> 33:35.844
Why?

33:39.782 --> 33:42.080
I've no idea what your wife likes.

33:52.628 --> 33:54.493
What about your husband?

34:35.972 --> 34:37.030
Like it hot?

34:41.310 --> 34:43.072
Your wife likes hot dishes.

35:11.674 --> 35:14.006
Why did you call me
at the office today?

35:18.981 --> 35:21.916
I had nothing to do.
I wanted to hear your voice.

35:27.023 --> 35:28.820
You have my husband down pat.

35:29.025 --> 35:30.652
He's a real sweet-talker.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.181
Why didn't you call me today?

36:00.389 --> 36:02.448
I was afraid you won't like it.

36:04.260 --> 36:06.228
Then don't call me again.

36:22.344 --> 36:24.676
Mrs. Chan!
A letter from your husband.

36:27.616 --> 36:29.914
It's not for me,
it's for Mr. Chow next door.

36:30.119 --> 36:34.419
The Japanese stamp made me think
it was your husband.

36:35.291 --> 36:36.918
So I was wrong.

36:53.542 --> 36:55.169
Your wife's in Japan?

36:57.213 --> 36:58.544
How did you know?

37:01.050 --> 37:02.711
What did she say in her letter?

37:03.419 --> 37:04.681
Nothing special.

37:06.822 --> 37:08.551
Anything about
when she'd be back?

37:10.392 --> 37:11.256
No.

37:12.595 --> 37:15.029
What do you think
they're doing right now?

37:51.333 --> 37:53.392
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

37:54.703 --> 37:56.568
Please pull up here!

37:57.173 --> 37:58.231
Why?

37:58.841 --> 38:00.468
I'll get off first.

38:01.510 --> 38:02.841
No, let me.

39:06.041 --> 39:08.339
- Mrs. Chan!
- Ah Ping! You're back?

39:09.245 --> 39:10.234
Visiting Mr. Chow?

39:10.446 --> 39:13.142
Yes, I thought we'd have lunch.
But he isn't well.

39:13.349 --> 39:14.373
What's wrong with him?

39:14.583 --> 39:16.744
He's got a fever. He's all alone.

39:17.119 --> 39:19.553
So I'm gonna buy him
something to eat.

39:20.222 --> 39:21.689
The congee downstairs
is quite good.

39:21.890 --> 39:23.482
He doesn't want congee.

39:23.926 --> 39:25.518
What does he want?

39:25.761 --> 39:28.025
Can't taste anything,
so he wants sesame syrup.

39:28.230 --> 39:29.595
Damned troublesome!

39:35.371 --> 39:37.100
Amah!

39:37.606 --> 39:40.200
Mrs. Suen, she's hanging
the washing on the roof.

39:40.576 --> 39:41.600
Oh, you're back.

39:41.810 --> 39:43.107
Yes... You've been out?

39:43.312 --> 39:46.713
My mother's birthday is coming up.

39:47.116 --> 39:48.913
So I took her to buy some fabric.

39:49.118 --> 39:51.177
It took all day. I'm half dead!

39:51.654 --> 39:53.781
And I had my hair done.
Is it nice?

39:53.989 --> 39:55.047
Very nice!

39:55.257 --> 39:56.884
What are you cooking?

39:57.760 --> 40:00.388
I had a sudden craving
for sesame syrup.

40:00.829 --> 40:03.457
That whole pot is for you?

40:03.999 --> 40:06.399
I thought I might as well
make a potful.

40:07.169 --> 40:08.966
You're so thoughtful!

40:09.738 --> 40:11.535
- Please try it.
- I will.

40:12.675 --> 40:14.006
What a coincidence!

40:14.209 --> 40:15.836
Going out?

40:16.045 --> 40:19.173
I'll buy some noodles. I'm starving.

40:19.381 --> 40:20.814
Hungry? Will you join me?

40:22.117 --> 40:23.175
No thanks.

40:24.019 --> 40:25.577
Just off work?

40:25.788 --> 40:27.380
You must be very busy.

40:27.589 --> 40:31.025
Actually, I've been to see a picture.

40:31.794 --> 40:33.591
Really? How was it?

40:34.063 --> 40:34.825
So-so.

40:35.431 --> 40:37.399
I used to like
going to the pictures.

40:37.900 --> 40:39.697
You had many hobbies before.

40:39.902 --> 40:43.099
On your own,
you are free to do lots of things.

40:43.806 --> 40:45.671
Everything changes
when you marry.

40:46.075 --> 40:48.043
It must be decided together.

40:48.243 --> 40:49.335
Right?

40:52.247 --> 40:55.341
I sometimes wonder
what I'd be if I hadn't married.

40:55.951 --> 40:57.578
Have you ever thought of that?

41:00.122 --> 41:01.419
Maybe happier!

41:05.594 --> 41:08.461
I didn't know married life
would be so complicated!

41:09.832 --> 41:11.390
When you're single,

41:11.600 --> 41:13.534
you are only responsible
to yourself.

41:14.436 --> 41:16.404
Once you're married,

41:17.406 --> 41:19.738
doing well on your own
is not enough.

41:21.944 --> 41:25.971
Don't brood on it.
Maybe he'll be back soon.

41:29.752 --> 41:31.310
What about you?

41:31.520 --> 41:33.215
Actually, we're in the same boat.

41:36.658 --> 41:38.421
But I don't brood on it.

41:39.461 --> 41:41.156
It's not my fault.

41:41.964 --> 41:44.762
I can't waste time
wondering if I made mistakes.

41:44.967 --> 41:46.798
Life's too short for that.

41:48.137 --> 41:49.798
Something must change.

41:51.340 --> 41:53.001
So what's your plan?

41:54.710 --> 41:58.077
I want to write a martial-arts serial.

41:59.047 --> 42:02.278
Actually, I've started one.
I'll show it to you.

42:02.684 --> 42:03.651
Great!

42:04.653 --> 42:07.622
You like them too,
so why not help me write it?

42:07.823 --> 42:11.350
I wouldn't know how,
I only read them!

42:11.560 --> 42:13.755
We could discuss it together.

42:15.063 --> 42:16.826
All right, I'll try my best.

42:18.634 --> 42:20.465
I never thanked you
for the sesame syrup.

42:20.836 --> 42:24.101
There's no need,
I was making it anyway.

42:25.374 --> 42:28.935
Amazing! I was craving
some sesame syrup that day.

42:29.878 --> 42:31.812
Really? What a coincidence!

42:32.147 --> 42:33.637
It really was!

42:35.517 --> 42:36.711
I'll go for those noodles.

45:04.566 --> 45:07.364
Again! Halfway through dinner,
he's drunk! Disgusting!

45:07.569 --> 45:10.663
I told you to stop!
What can you do?

45:18.847 --> 45:19.836
It's me!

45:20.048 --> 45:21.481
You scared me.

45:21.683 --> 45:23.310
How's Mr. Koo?

45:23.652 --> 45:25.313
Drunk, as usual.

45:34.396 --> 45:36.296
I didn't expect them back so early!

45:38.900 --> 45:41.528
Since you're trapped here,
finish the noodles.

45:45.440 --> 45:47.237
They'll probably go soon.

45:58.286 --> 45:59.913
Want some soup?

46:03.025 --> 46:04.720
Want some soup?

46:16.104 --> 46:18.664
Mrs. Suen! Playing here tonight!

46:19.574 --> 46:22.202
Yes, Mrs. Koo is dealing
with her husband.

46:22.978 --> 46:25.208
I could do that.

46:25.414 --> 46:27.678
No, we should not trouble you.

46:28.784 --> 46:31.116
Think you'll play all night?

46:31.319 --> 46:34.049
No, we'll just play eight rounds.

46:38.627 --> 46:40.424
They'll play till morning?

46:41.496 --> 46:43.293
Mrs. Suen says only eight rounds.

46:44.066 --> 46:45.590
You believe that?

46:51.907 --> 46:55.138
You get some rest.
I'll wake you when they leave.

46:55.944 --> 46:57.104
And you?

46:57.412 --> 46:59.277
I have a chapter to finish.

47:13.128 --> 47:14.755
Where have you got to?

47:15.163 --> 47:17.097
The drunken master just showed up.

47:17.299 --> 47:18.960
When did he get written in?

47:20.135 --> 47:21.261
Just now!

47:44.559 --> 47:46.686
Mr. Chow, home so early?

47:46.895 --> 47:49.796
- I went out to buy some food.
- No work today?

47:49.998 --> 47:51.659
I don't feel so good,
I'm staying home.

47:51.867 --> 47:54.097
A sick man shouldn't eat
all that sticky rice.

47:54.402 --> 47:55.960
Some of it's for later.

47:56.171 --> 47:57.968
Don't stuff yourself!.

47:58.507 --> 47:59.371
Good morning!

47:59.574 --> 48:01.098
Good morning.
Finished your game?

48:01.309 --> 48:04.767
Not yet, but Mr. Yang has to work.

48:05.013 --> 48:06.674
Mr. Tsai is coming to replace him.

48:08.350 --> 48:10.341
Did you call the office for me?

48:10.685 --> 48:11.811
Yes.

48:12.053 --> 48:13.714
What did you tell them?

48:14.055 --> 48:15.716
That you weren't feeling well.

48:16.992 --> 48:18.789
Did they ask who you were?

48:18.994 --> 48:19.892
No.

48:23.265 --> 48:25.233
Probably took me for your husband.

48:26.201 --> 48:28.897
Mr. Ho knows that he's away.

48:29.404 --> 48:31.031
Pretend he's come back.

48:40.015 --> 48:41.710
Maybe we're being too cautious.

48:42.250 --> 48:44.081
I'm always round anyway.

48:44.286 --> 48:46.049
We shouldn't have panicked.

48:47.956 --> 48:51.050
Well, they did turn up
without warning.

48:51.259 --> 48:52.988
What would they assume?

48:56.231 --> 48:58.165
One can't put a foot wrong.

49:37.973 --> 49:38.940
You can go!

50:03.531 --> 50:06.125
- Amah!
- Mrs. Chan! You're back very late!

50:06.868 --> 50:08.768
I had a lot of work today.

50:09.204 --> 50:11.798
I didn't see you leave this morning.

50:12.007 --> 50:13.975
I had breakfast with my mother.

50:14.175 --> 50:15.836
You weren't here when I left.

50:17.445 --> 50:18.173
Where's Mrs. Suen?

50:18.380 --> 50:22.339
Asleep.
She played mahjong all day.

50:22.550 --> 50:24.677
- Be quiet, don't wake her.
- All right!

50:25.220 --> 50:27.017
Mrs. Chan, is your leg all right?

50:27.222 --> 50:29.281
It's these new shoes.

51:15.537 --> 51:17.596
Why a special dinner tonight?

51:18.173 --> 51:22.109
Since you won't take
your share of the writing fee...

51:23.611 --> 51:26.273
All I did was give you some thoughts.

51:27.482 --> 51:29.814
Someone else
is asking for a serial too.

51:30.185 --> 51:31.914
There'll be more work soon.

51:32.120 --> 51:35.920
Really? So quickly?
Isn't the workload too much?

51:36.191 --> 51:38.318
That's why
I'm looking for a new place.

51:39.227 --> 51:40.285
What for?

51:42.030 --> 51:43.190
To write in!

51:44.399 --> 51:46.333
It'll be more convenient.

51:47.035 --> 51:50.835
There's nothing between us,
but I don't want gossip.

51:52.841 --> 51:54.468
What do you think?

51:55.577 --> 51:57.477
Why waste money?

51:58.179 --> 52:02.377
You don't need me.
You can write on your own.

52:42.190 --> 52:44.090
Who do you want?

52:44.292 --> 52:45.987
Chow Mo-Wan?

52:46.261 --> 52:48.559
He hasn't been in for several days.

52:51.433 --> 52:53.333
We're looking for him too.

52:55.303 --> 52:57.567
May I know who's calling?

53:00.208 --> 53:01.835
Any message?

53:03.812 --> 53:05.905
It's no trouble. Good-bye.

53:18.393 --> 53:20.418
Please get this to Accounts.

53:20.628 --> 53:23.096
And have the air-conditioner
serviced tomorrow.

53:23.431 --> 53:24.363
Mr. Ho!

53:25.967 --> 53:28.197
No need to stay
if everything's done.

53:28.403 --> 53:30.064
- I'll lock up.
- Yes.

53:42.150 --> 53:43.208
Hello?

53:48.656 --> 53:50.283
Where are you?

54:54.288 --> 54:55.983
I'll come again tomorrow.

54:56.791 --> 54:59.089
No need.
I'll be all right after some rest.

55:00.194 --> 55:01.923
It's no trouble.

55:02.797 --> 55:05.357
I'll bring you some food.
What would you like?

55:05.800 --> 55:06.994
Whatever.

55:07.769 --> 55:10.533
Then I'll leave now. Get some rest.

55:10.805 --> 55:12.534
Call me when you get home.

55:13.040 --> 55:15.907
Let it ring three times,
then hang up.

55:16.811 --> 55:17.436
All right.

55:24.952 --> 55:26.681
I didn't think you'd come.

55:30.725 --> 55:32.522
We won't be like them.

55:34.328 --> 55:35.352
See you tomorrow.

57:51.832 --> 57:53.561
Tell me honestly...

57:56.437 --> 57:58.234
do you have a mistress?

58:01.008 --> 58:02.635
You're crazy!

58:05.513 --> 58:07.140
Who told you I had?

58:07.381 --> 58:09.008
Never mind who.

58:09.951 --> 58:11.646
Do you or don't you?

58:14.355 --> 58:15.379
No.

58:20.928 --> 58:22.589
Don't lie!

58:23.965 --> 58:25.728
Look at me.

58:30.705 --> 58:33.037
I'm asking you,
do you have a mistress?

58:37.712 --> 58:38.679
Yes!

58:44.885 --> 58:46.580
That's no reaction!

58:47.622 --> 58:51.922
If he admits it outright,
let him have it!

58:55.663 --> 58:58.063
I wasn't expecting
he would admit it so easily.

58:59.967 --> 59:01.594
I didn't know how to react!

59:03.904 --> 59:05.098
One more time, all right?

59:23.024 --> 59:24.958
Tell me frankly.

59:26.160 --> 59:27.957
Do you have a mistress?

59:31.799 --> 59:33.130
You're crazy!

59:38.706 --> 59:40.333
Who told you that?

59:41.876 --> 59:45.141
Never mind that.
Do you or don't you?

59:50.685 --> 59:51.743
No.

59:54.388 --> 59:56.015
Don't lie!

59:56.524 --> 59:58.253
Tell me!

59:59.393 --> 01:00:00.655
Look at me.

01:00:01.295 --> 01:00:02.853
Do you have a mistress?

01:00:12.406 --> 01:00:13.338
Yes!

01:00:40.101 --> 01:00:41.728
Are you all right?

01:00:45.206 --> 01:00:47.470
I didn't expect it to hurt so much.

01:00:56.917 --> 01:00:59.477
This is just a rehearsal.

01:01:02.923 --> 01:01:05.050
He won't really admit it so readily.

01:01:05.626 --> 01:01:09.062
It's all right. Don't take it so hard.

01:01:13.801 --> 01:01:15.962
You've been out a lot lately.

01:01:16.203 --> 01:01:17.261
Yes.

01:01:19.473 --> 01:01:23.273
It's right to enjoy yourself
while you're young.

01:01:24.211 --> 01:01:26.145
But don't overdo it.

01:01:29.183 --> 01:01:31.083
When will your husband be back?

01:01:31.619 --> 01:01:33.246
Soon!

01:01:34.388 --> 01:01:38.654
In future,
don't let him travel so much.

01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:42.827
A couple should spend time
together.

01:01:43.731 --> 01:01:45.494
Don't you agree?

01:01:47.668 --> 01:01:48.692
Good night.

01:02:10.724 --> 01:02:12.453
Will you come over tonight?

01:02:12.927 --> 01:02:14.189
What for?

01:02:14.395 --> 01:02:16.955
The editor's hounding me.
He says I'm too slow.

01:02:17.164 --> 01:02:19.462
I need your help.
When can you come?

01:02:20.601 --> 01:02:22.831
Not anytime soon.

01:02:23.504 --> 01:02:24.835
Why not?

01:02:25.506 --> 01:02:28.304
Mrs. Suen lectured me last night.

01:02:28.676 --> 01:02:30.234
What did she say?

01:02:30.444 --> 01:02:32.071
Rather not say.

01:02:32.413 --> 01:02:34.847
We shouldn't see so much
of each other.

01:02:46.026 --> 01:02:48.756
Mrs. Chan,
going out for noodles again?

01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:52.897
Not tonight.
I'll make myself something.

01:02:53.767 --> 01:02:59.831
Join us.
We're having vegetable won-tons!

01:03:00.107 --> 01:03:01.165
All right.

01:05:33.227 --> 01:05:35.058
- No lunch today, Mr. Ho?
- No.

01:05:36.797 --> 01:05:39.163
A Mr. Chow just called for you.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.231
He wants you to call him back.

01:05:44.405 --> 01:05:45.372
Thank you.

01:06:18.405 --> 01:06:20.566
- Back from work?
- Yes.

01:06:22.443 --> 01:06:25.071
- Strange weather!
- Isn't it?

01:06:25.746 --> 01:06:27.304
Been here long?

01:06:27.514 --> 01:06:29.141
Just a while.

01:06:31.251 --> 01:06:33.048
I don't think it'll stop soon.

01:06:35.255 --> 01:06:36.244
Wait for me.

01:07:05.052 --> 01:07:06.679
I'll see you home.

01:07:07.154 --> 01:07:10.521
We'd better not be seen together.

01:07:12.226 --> 01:07:14.091
Then you go first.

01:07:16.163 --> 01:07:17.858
If they see your umbrella...

01:07:18.065 --> 01:07:20.465
they'll know I was with you.

01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:24.531
I wasn't thinking.

01:07:28.075 --> 01:07:31.203
You go first, I'll wait a while.

01:07:33.347 --> 01:07:35.042
I'll keep you company.

01:07:57.037 --> 01:07:58.732
Did you try to call me?

01:08:00.874 --> 01:08:03.240
I wasn't sure you got the message.

01:08:04.077 --> 01:08:06.068
Could you get me a boat ticket?

01:08:08.282 --> 01:08:10.079
To where?

01:08:11.451 --> 01:08:13.681
Ah Ping wrote from Singapore.

01:08:14.021 --> 01:08:17.548
They're short of staff.
He'd like me to go and help.

01:08:21.694 --> 01:08:23.390
How long will you stay?

01:08:23.596 --> 01:08:26.191
Don't know. I'll play it by ear.

01:08:31.371 --> 01:08:33.362
Why rush off to Singapore?

01:08:35.309 --> 01:08:37.004
A change of scene.

01:08:38.879 --> 01:08:40.779
I've had enough of the gossip.

01:08:42.616 --> 01:08:44.709
We know it's not true,
so why worry?

01:08:48.721 --> 01:08:53.091
I used to think that too,
and it didn't worry me.

01:08:56.763 --> 01:08:58.754
I thought we wouldn't be like them.

01:09:03.136 --> 01:09:04.796
But I was wrong.

01:09:07.674 --> 01:09:09.733
You won't leave your husband.

01:09:12.479 --> 01:09:14.207
So I'd rather go away.

01:09:21.188 --> 01:09:23.712
I didn't think
you'd fall in love with me.

01:09:24.825 --> 01:09:26.622
I didn't either.

01:09:31.832 --> 01:09:34.265
I was only curious
to know how it started.

01:09:35.368 --> 01:09:37.064
Now I know.

01:09:38.839 --> 01:09:40.898
Feelings can creep up just like that.

01:09:45.045 --> 01:09:46.808
I thought I was in control.

01:09:47.848 --> 01:09:50.339
But I hate to think
of your husband coming home.

01:09:51.451 --> 01:09:52.917
I wish he'd stay away!

01:09:54.688 --> 01:09:56.178
I'm so bad!

01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:01.925
Will you do me one favor?

01:10:03.163 --> 01:10:04.152
What?

01:10:05.732 --> 01:10:07.495
I want to be prepared.

01:11:04.257 --> 01:11:06.248
You'd better not see me again.

01:11:11.365 --> 01:11:13.162
Is your husband back?

01:11:14.201 --> 01:11:15.168
Yes.

01:11:17.437 --> 01:11:19.098
Am I hopeless?

01:11:21.441 --> 01:11:22.840
Not really.

01:11:33.253 --> 01:11:35.016
I won't see you again.

01:11:37.491 --> 01:11:39.356
Keep a closer eye on your husband.

01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:21.763
Please.

01:12:22.969 --> 01:12:25.130
Don't be serious,
it's only a rehearsal.

01:12:26.606 --> 01:12:27.971
Don't cry!

01:12:32.479 --> 01:12:34.140
This isn't real.

01:13:24.431 --> 01:13:26.296
I don't want to go home tonight.

01:13:53.026 --> 01:13:57.486
Mei-Yi wants to dedicate a song
to her honeymooning friends.

01:13:57.697 --> 01:14:02.498
And Mrs. Cheung wishes the best
to her neighbors.

01:14:03.203 --> 01:14:05.603
And Mr. Chan,
now on business in Japan,

01:14:05.805 --> 01:14:11.766
wants to wish his wife
a happy birthday.

01:14:12.045 --> 01:14:16.880
So let's all enjoy Zhou Xuan
singing in "Full Bloom".

01:15:57.851 --> 01:15:59.011
It's me.

01:16:00.587 --> 01:16:02.316
If there's an extra ticket...

01:16:03.523 --> 01:16:04.956
would you go with me?

01:18:33.573 --> 01:18:34.938
It's me.

01:18:36.042 --> 01:18:38.169
If there's an extra ticket...

01:18:38.545 --> 01:18:40.479
would you go with me?

01:18:52.091 --> 01:18:54.651
SINGAPORE, 1963.

01:18:57.197 --> 01:18:59.290
Mr. Chow has gone to work.

01:19:00.166 --> 01:19:01.963
Any message?

01:19:03.369 --> 01:19:04.996
You're welcome!

01:19:35.034 --> 01:19:36.626
Has anyone been in my room?

01:19:36.836 --> 01:19:37.768
No.

01:19:38.204 --> 01:19:39.501
Something's missing.

01:19:39.839 --> 01:19:40.897
What?

01:20:11.304 --> 01:20:12.430
In the old days...

01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:19.242
if someone had a secret
they didn't want to share...

01:20:19.846 --> 01:20:21.575
you know what they did?

01:20:22.482 --> 01:20:24.279
Have no idea.

01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:29.688
They went up a mountain,
found a tree...

01:20:31.791 --> 01:20:33.486
carved a hole in it...

01:20:34.294 --> 01:20:36.262
and whispered the secret
into the hole.

01:20:37.463 --> 01:20:39.590
Then they covered it with mud.

01:20:41.367 --> 01:20:45.463
And leave the secret there forever.

01:20:47.707 --> 01:20:51.803
What a pain!
I'd just go to get laid.

01:20:55.081 --> 01:20:56.742
Not everyone's like you!

01:20:58.284 --> 01:21:02.118
I'm just an average guy.
I don't have secrets like you.

01:21:02.555 --> 01:21:05.388
You bottle things up!

01:21:05.591 --> 01:21:07.422
Tell me something!

01:21:07.994 --> 01:21:09.689
I don't have secrets.

01:21:11.331 --> 01:21:13.424
Come off it, buddy!

01:21:14.434 --> 01:21:16.163
I won't tell anyone.

01:23:44.250 --> 01:23:45.911
Hello, Singapore Daily.

01:23:46.586 --> 01:23:47.917
Hold on.

01:23:48.988 --> 01:23:50.751
Mr. Chow, call for you.

01:23:51.090 --> 01:23:52.114
Thanks!

01:23:55.261 --> 01:23:56.125
Hello?

01:24:02.235 --> 01:24:03.202
Hello?

01:24:52.051 --> 01:24:54.952
- Who is it?
- It's me.

01:24:55.655 --> 01:24:58.624
- Mrs. Chan, long time no see!
- Yes.

01:24:59.358 --> 01:25:01.258
- Amah, who's there?
- Mrs. Suen!

01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:03.485
What brings you here?

01:25:03.696 --> 01:25:05.425
It's been a while.

01:25:05.631 --> 01:25:09.089
I was nearby so I thought
I'd bring your boat ticket.

01:25:09.802 --> 01:25:10.791
And a small gift.

01:25:11.003 --> 01:25:14.302
You shouldn't have.
It's nice just to see you.

01:25:15.007 --> 01:25:16.167
The place is in such a mess!

01:25:16.375 --> 01:25:17.535
Already started packing?

01:25:17.743 --> 01:25:24.205
It's hopeless.
I can't bear to throw things away!

01:25:25.918 --> 01:25:27.613
Let's find you a seat.

01:25:31.724 --> 01:25:33.521
- Have some tea!
- Thank you!

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:38.392
Eat with us, Mrs. Chan!
I'm going to the market.

01:25:40.099 --> 01:25:43.227
I can't. I have work waiting.

01:25:43.869 --> 01:25:45.837
Don't rush off!.

01:25:46.339 --> 01:25:50.833
Mrs. Suen will be upset
if you don't eat here.

01:25:51.611 --> 01:25:53.579
Amah, pour me some tea too.

01:25:55.181 --> 01:25:56.808
How's your husband?

01:25:57.016 --> 01:25:58.643
He's fine, thank you.

01:25:58.751 --> 01:26:00.378
How long will you be away?

01:26:00.586 --> 01:26:02.213
I don't know.

01:26:02.421 --> 01:26:05.015
If I like it, I might stay!

01:26:05.825 --> 01:26:06.985
Why?

01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:12.960
My daughter worries
about the situation in Hong Kong.

01:26:13.165 --> 01:26:15.998
I don't want to leave.

01:26:16.235 --> 01:26:22.299
Since the Koos left, I don't have
my mahjong partners anymore.

01:26:22.775 --> 01:26:28.372
And my daughter needs help
with her kids in the US.

01:26:31.684 --> 01:26:33.311
What about this place?

01:26:34.186 --> 01:26:36.313
I'm not sure...

01:26:37.923 --> 01:26:39.982
I don't want to sell it.

01:26:41.794 --> 01:26:43.819
So I might rent it out.

01:26:44.930 --> 01:26:46.659
How much would you want?

01:26:47.933 --> 01:26:49.662
You're interested?

01:26:49.869 --> 01:26:54.329
You could have it at a discount.

01:26:54.573 --> 01:26:56.165
I'll think about it.

01:26:56.375 --> 01:26:57.865
Mrs. Suen, your tea!

01:26:59.312 --> 01:27:01.712
Who lives next door now?

01:27:02.114 --> 01:27:08.451
I don't really know them.

01:27:08.821 --> 01:27:14.851
The Koos were almost like family!

01:27:16.295 --> 01:27:19.389
It was so nice then, wasn't it?

01:27:20.099 --> 01:27:21.031
Yes.

01:27:22.668 --> 01:27:24.295
Let's sit over here.

01:27:50.863 --> 01:27:51.830
Yes?

01:27:52.031 --> 01:27:53.362
Is Mr. Koo in?

01:27:53.566 --> 01:27:56.194
He moved long ago.

01:27:56.869 --> 01:27:58.496
Do you know where he is?

01:27:59.505 --> 01:28:01.166
You know him well?

01:28:01.741 --> 01:28:03.436
I used to live here.

01:28:04.710 --> 01:28:06.439
Is Mrs. Suen still next door?

01:28:06.846 --> 01:28:11.806
She's gone! It's too chaotic.
Everyone's running away.

01:28:12.818 --> 01:28:14.547
So who lives there now?

01:28:15.054 --> 01:28:19.514
A woman and her son.

01:28:19.725 --> 01:28:21.522
The kid is cute.

01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:29.026
No address in the Philippines.
Just his son's phone number.

01:28:32.571 --> 01:28:36.337
- I can't accept this!
- Please, you must.

01:28:36.709 --> 01:28:38.370
Thank you, then.

01:28:49.688 --> 01:28:51.315
That era has passed.

01:28:51.557 --> 01:28:54.355
Nothing that belonged to it
exists any more.

01:28:55.294 --> 01:28:56.818
Are you ready?

01:28:57.029 --> 01:28:58.894
- Okay!
- Let's go!

01:29:11.243 --> 01:29:14.701
CAMBODIA, 1966

01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:19.579
The presidential corps waits
at Pochentong Airport...

01:29:19.985 --> 01:29:24.285
Prince Norodom Sihanouk
and Queen Sisowath Kossamak...

01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:26.719
come forward
to greet General De Gaulle.

01:29:33.799 --> 01:29:38.759
It's ten kilometers
from Pochentong to Phnom Penh.

01:29:39.939 --> 01:29:42.533
200,000 people line the route.

01:29:42.741 --> 01:29:45.073
A welcome unprecedented
in the history of the kingdom.

01:33:20.526 --> 01:33:23.586
He remembers those vanished years.

01:33:23.796 --> 01:33:27.596
As though looking through
a dusty window pane,

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:31.930
the past is something he could see,
but not touch.

01:33:32.137 --> 01:33:36.631
And everything he sees
is blurred and indistinct.

01:33:41.480 --> 01:33:46.508
End

01:33:48.887 --> 01:33:51.048
