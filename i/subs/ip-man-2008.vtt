01:46.239 --> 01:50.323
Fo Shan's citizens were well off
and practiced kung-fu as a hobby.

01:50.423 --> 01:52.137
Martial clubs became popular,

01:52.138 --> 01:55.507
turning Fo Shan into a province
renowned for martial arts.

01:57.250 --> 02:00.583
Martial Arts Street in Fo Shan, 1935

02:20.773 --> 02:22.297
Another competitor.

02:22.542 --> 02:23.474
Okay, let's start practicing.

02:23.676 --> 02:25.371
Come on, ready...

02:26.146 --> 02:27.272
One...

02:27.413 --> 02:28.437
Two...

02:28.581 --> 02:30.913
One... two...

03:04.250 --> 03:06.650
Sir, a Master Liu is looking for you.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.589
May I know who you are?

03:19.832 --> 03:21.493
I'm the patriarch of the Liu Fist Sect.

03:21.868 --> 03:23.699
I just started a martial club in Fo Shan.

03:23.836 --> 03:24.928
Congratulations.

03:25.505 --> 03:28.963
I hear that Master Ip
is a Wing Chun expert.

03:29.175 --> 03:32.167
I'd love to practice with you today.

03:32.745 --> 03:34.235
Can we do it some other day?

03:34.380 --> 03:35.642
It's not convenient right now.

03:35.848 --> 03:37.497
Since I'm already here,

03:37.597 --> 03:40.644
let's just play around for a bit.

03:40.887 --> 03:44.550
It's all private.
No one else shall know who wins.

03:44.791 --> 03:47.555
It's not a matter of winning.
I'm having dinner.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.524
In that case... I'll wait for you.

04:00.240 --> 04:01.537
Master Liu.

04:02.308 --> 04:03.434
Have you eaten yet?

04:04.544 --> 04:06.239
Please join me.

04:42.682 --> 04:43.876
You want one?

04:45.084 --> 04:46.608
No, thanks.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.727
Is the food all right tonight?

04:56.863 --> 04:58.524
Very good indeed.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.298
That's good.

05:05.505 --> 05:06.494
Very quick.

05:15.381 --> 05:18.782
Leave it, Uncle Wang.
Close the door first.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.039
Master Liu.

05:59.726 --> 06:00.658
Please!

06:01.627 --> 06:02.491
Please!

06:30.556 --> 06:31.372
Are you okay?

06:31.472 --> 06:32.651
I'm fine...

06:33.393 --> 06:34.382
Let's start again!

06:35.395 --> 06:36.555
Okay, here I come.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.700
Touché!

06:41.834 --> 06:43.631
Touché!

06:44.036 --> 06:45.162
All touché!

07:01.187 --> 07:02.814
Thanks for being lenient, Master Liu.

07:17.703 --> 07:19.193
Thanks for teaching me.
I've learned a lot.

07:19.505 --> 07:20.836
The pleasure was all mine.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.924
Regarding this private duel, Master Ip...

07:24.024 --> 07:26.706
I won't tell anyone. Don't worry.

07:27.046 --> 07:28.946
Thanks so much. I'm so grateful.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.037
Goodbye.

07:31.751 --> 07:32.740
Farewell.

07:33.820 --> 07:35.048
So long.

07:39.759 --> 07:41.954
With "Move 1000 Catties with 4 Taels",

07:42.094 --> 07:43.561
Ip pushed Master Liu's whole body away.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.597
Isn't "Move 1000 Catties with 4 Taels" 
Tai Chi?

07:45.765 --> 07:47.665
I thought Master Ip practiced Wing Chun.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.828
Anyway, 
he pushed him away with one hand.

07:50.036 --> 07:51.503
Liu refused to admit defeat.

07:51.671 --> 07:54.105
Ip kept chasing after him fiercely!

07:54.707 --> 07:57.608
But Liu remained 
indignant after being hit.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.869
He jumped at Ip like a hungry dog.

08:03.883 --> 08:06.113
These tea leaves are 
pretty good and cheap.

08:06.486 --> 08:07.286
Thank you.

08:07.587 --> 08:08.884
Got to go.
Farewell.

08:09.055 --> 08:11.080
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, see you next time.

08:14.126 --> 08:16.890
Who put these here, Uncle Ping?

08:17.063 --> 08:18.553
Your brother.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.523
I thought Liu was good 
but he's so bad at defence...

08:21.734 --> 08:23.827
and was beaten up like a pighead.

08:24.871 --> 08:28.272
He co-owns his dad's 
restaurant. He's always idle.

08:28.708 --> 08:30.539
Ask that kid to serve the customers.

08:30.743 --> 08:31.543
Good morning.

08:31.644 --> 08:32.443
Brother Ip!

08:32.678 --> 08:33.494
Morning, Master Ip.

08:33.594 --> 08:34.394
Is Quan here yet?

08:34.514 --> 08:35.845
He's waiting for you upstairs.

08:38.918 --> 08:40.613
Been here long, Quan?

08:41.053 --> 08:42.543
You're always late.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.553
I'm busy.

08:45.791 --> 08:46.849
Busy with what?

08:47.894 --> 08:51.489
Drinking tea, eating, practicing.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.123
What else?

08:56.235 --> 08:57.759
This tea smells nice.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.768
I'm talking about you.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.803
Have you ordered yet?

09:03.209 --> 09:04.836
I got something to discuss with you.

09:05.077 --> 09:06.271
Let's eat first and then we'll talk.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.704
This just came out of the oven! 
Try it...

09:10.283 --> 09:12.183
Heard that you had 
a duel with Master Liu...

09:12.585 --> 09:14.985
and had beaten him quickly. 
Is that true?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.022
Who told you that, Lin?

09:17.723 --> 09:18.985
My brother.

09:19.191 --> 09:22.649
Should've told me earlier. 
I'm his disciple now!

09:23.563 --> 09:25.121
But you've been 
a disciple of every master.

09:25.765 --> 09:28.666
Was it a private duel, Brother Ip?

09:29.669 --> 09:31.967
We have things to discuss. 
Leave us for now.

09:32.271 --> 09:34.262
Then I won't disturb 
your private conversation.

09:50.623 --> 09:51.681
Good!

09:51.891 --> 09:53.188
- Morning, Master! 
- Morning.

09:54.327 --> 09:54.994
Morning.

09:55.094 --> 09:55.894
Master.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.959
I heard that you were beaten by Ip Man.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.277
Everyone in Fo Shan knows about it now.

09:59.377 --> 10:00.816
Nonsense! Who told you that?

10:00.916 --> 10:02.629
Yuan at the restaurant.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.129
Everything is expensive 
in Fo Shan these days.

10:07.373 --> 10:08.271
So what?

10:10.743 --> 10:12.938
That means the 
economy is good in Fo Shan.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.504
Everybody can afford to spend money.

10:16.282 --> 10:17.112
Is that so?

10:17.650 --> 10:20.744
Clothing is the most 
important in our daily lives.

10:22.989 --> 10:26.186
There will be lots of 
demand for future clothing.

10:27.093 --> 10:30.290
I'll open a cotton mill
to provide cotton for them.

10:34.200 --> 10:35.633
I want you to be my partner.

10:36.936 --> 10:38.164
I don't know anything about business.

10:38.904 --> 10:39.962
But I do.

10:40.072 --> 10:41.403
I'm not in need of money.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.106
Who's Yuan? Show yourself!

10:45.311 --> 10:46.642
I am

10:51.183 --> 10:53.344
You rascal. You ruined my reputation.

10:53.786 --> 10:55.253
I must teach you a lesson!

10:55.488 --> 10:56.887
Master...

10:57.356 --> 10:59.187
He's my brother. Let's talk.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.916
Calm down. Okay, Master?

11:01.360 --> 11:04.193
Your brother?
He ruined my reputation.

11:05.131 --> 11:06.689
He said I was beaten by Ip Man.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.799
What's gonna happen to my martial club?

11:08.901 --> 11:10.698
Who will want to be my disciples?

11:11.003 --> 11:11.901
Apologize!

11:12.204 --> 11:14.001
I didn't do anything wrong. 
I told the truth!

11:14.206 --> 11:16.970
You're bullshitting again! 
You... Master...

11:17.910 --> 11:20.037
Master Ip is upstairs. 
Seek him out if you have guts!

11:21.013 --> 11:22.776
What? Go!

11:23.849 --> 11:25.942
Take it easy, Master...

11:28.087 --> 11:29.247
Master...

11:29.455 --> 11:31.184
Don't be angry, Master.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.260
I've been wronged, Master Ip.

11:35.728 --> 11:36.820
Master,

11:36.929 --> 11:37.729
please tell everybody...

11:37.777 --> 11:40.027
you've defeated Master Liu in a duel.

11:47.940 --> 11:49.271
Master Ip...

11:49.408 --> 11:51.137
You got to clear my name.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.977
You liar, 
why're you bothering Brother Ip?

11:57.283 --> 11:58.545
I'm no liar.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.852
I saw the duel when 
I was picking up my kite.

12:01.887 --> 12:05.050
Your kite got lost
and fell into Brother Ip's house.

12:05.257 --> 12:09.250
You saw the whole duel
between the two masters.

12:09.361 --> 12:11.192
Isn't that too much of a coincidence?

12:11.297 --> 12:12.423
That's exactly what happened.

12:12.832 --> 12:14.846
Even if it's true, 
you shouldn't have told everyone.

12:14.946 --> 12:16.128
You're not supposed 
to tell certain things

12:16.235 --> 12:17.293
What's wrong with 
telling the truth?

12:17.403 --> 12:18.768
That might cause 
embarrassment for others.

12:18.871 --> 12:20.771
What embarrassment? I don't know how!

12:23.843 --> 12:25.208
This is embarrassment!

12:28.447 --> 12:30.779
You don't need to do that, Lin.

12:30.983 --> 12:32.974
Why're you laughing? 
You think I'm invisible?

12:34.520 --> 12:36.010
Captain... it's no big deal.

12:36.122 --> 12:36.922
What's no big deal?

12:36.989 --> 12:38.957
- Leave!
- Don't you leave!

12:39.225 --> 12:40.089
Captain, it's no big deal.

12:40.326 --> 12:42.521
I saw everything. I'm warning you...

12:43.395 --> 12:46.455
I'll nab whoever causes 
trouble in my district.

12:47.933 --> 12:48.922
I didn't cause any trouble.

12:49.235 --> 12:52.204
Someone ruined my name. 
I'm here to claim justice.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.431
What justice? I am justice.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.876
You hooligans are fighting all the time.

12:59.245 --> 13:00.439
What age are we in now?

13:01.113 --> 13:02.080
Still talking about martial arts?

13:03.015 --> 13:05.176
We're talking about arms and guns!

13:05.384 --> 13:07.375
Guns. Got it?

13:31.110 --> 13:32.236
You know, Captain Li...

13:33.012 --> 13:35.446
We martial artists are energetic.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.009
Sometimes we might be a bit too loud.

13:38.584 --> 13:40.848
But that doesn't mean 
we're not civilized.

13:42.121 --> 13:45.852
We're civilized folks.
Please don't pull the gun.

13:46.458 --> 13:47.447
Cut me some slack.

13:48.494 --> 13:51.224
Lin, set a table for Captain Li. 
It's on me.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.594
Yes... Captain Li, this way please.

13:54.066 --> 13:55.849
What you looking at? Get lost

13:55.949 --> 13:57.368
Don't stare. Don't stare... 
Get out of the way.

13:57.937 --> 13:58.737
Please.

14:02.875 --> 14:03.739
Master Liu.

14:05.177 --> 14:05.977
As you please.

14:10.883 --> 14:12.180
Why so secretive?

14:14.887 --> 14:16.320
I'm really not good at business.

14:19.458 --> 14:23.326
Take this to set up the mill.
Pay me back if you make a profit.

14:25.631 --> 14:27.531
It'll be a while before I can repay you.

14:28.300 --> 14:29.426
Take your time.

14:31.003 --> 14:33.631
Another request: 
Take my son as your disciple.

14:34.907 --> 14:38.001
There're so many martial club masters. 
Ask them.

14:38.611 --> 14:41.011
None of them is better than you.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.408
We're similar.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.233
Brother Ip.

14:44.333 --> 14:45.340
Lin.

14:46.085 --> 14:46.983
Brother Quan.

14:47.286 --> 14:50.983
I learned some new moves. 
Practice with me

14:51.523 --> 14:53.582
You got so much time. 
You found your brother?

14:54.093 --> 14:55.025
Let him be.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.127
He'll come back once 
he spent all his money.

14:57.596 --> 14:58.585
Let's try.

15:00.432 --> 15:02.332
Dad, did Uncle Ip agree?

15:03.502 --> 15:04.628
Let's go watch over there.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.075
You draw very well, Zhun.

15:12.278 --> 15:13.973
What new moves have you learned? 
Let's see.

15:15.281 --> 15:17.044
Brother Ip, my master says,

15:17.149 --> 15:18.980
this move is offense
and defense all in one.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.449
Attack while defending. 
Defend while attacking.

15:21.954 --> 15:23.148
Aren't they the same?

15:23.322 --> 15:25.313
Go away, ignorant kid.

15:26.625 --> 15:27.592
Here I come.

15:38.604 --> 15:41.198
This move attacks the midrib.

15:41.373 --> 15:44.035
Stop reciting mantras. 
Hit your target.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.138
Mom, I'm done with my drawing.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.713
So beautiful. Show it to Dad.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.983
Hit to disperse. 
Disperse while hitting

15:53.419 --> 15:54.499
My last move was 
"disperse while hitting"...

15:54.599 --> 15:55.565
Dad, look.

15:55.665 --> 15:57.053
Wait. I'm busy at the moment

15:57.389 --> 15:58.436
- You don't get it? 
- No.

15:58.536 --> 15:59.570
Come again if you don't get it.

15:59.670 --> 16:00.682
Try again

16:02.995 --> 16:05.361
Dad doesn't want to see it.

16:11.036 --> 16:12.298
There you go.
What?

16:14.239 --> 16:15.968
That was "disperse while hitting" 
Once more, Master Ip.

16:16.075 --> 16:17.235
I couldn't see clearly.

16:17.343 --> 16:18.708
See? What do you wanna see?

16:19.078 --> 16:21.410
You guys fight every day. 
Aren't you tired?

16:26.485 --> 16:27.452
You okay, Brother Ip?

16:34.026 --> 16:35.493
Sorry, Mrs. Ip.

16:39.231 --> 16:40.596
Goodbye, Mrs. Ip.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.494
I wasn't talking about you.

16:42.601 --> 16:44.569
No, there're things to 
take care of at the mill.

16:48.307 --> 16:49.137
Yao.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.459
I gotta go, Uncle Ip.

16:53.559 --> 16:55.342
Okay, see you next time.

16:58.384 --> 16:59.544
Bye, Ip.

17:04.556 --> 17:07.047
Talk to me if you're not happy.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.184
No need to throw a tantrum.

17:10.329 --> 17:12.797
Okay, please take a look
at your son's drawing.

17:13.632 --> 17:16.760
Spend more time with 
him and less with your pals.

17:19.471 --> 17:20.665
Let's go inside, okay?

17:22.574 --> 17:23.438
Go.

17:49.468 --> 17:50.457
Brother.

17:50.669 --> 17:51.761
Where's the martial club street?

17:52.838 --> 17:53.702
Martial club!

17:54.606 --> 17:55.595
Go straight ahead.

18:21.400 --> 18:29.239
One, two...

18:33.112 --> 18:35.376
Which martial club should 
be challenge first, Bro?

18:35.547 --> 18:37.708
One... two!

18:38.117 --> 18:39.175
One...

18:39.318 --> 18:40.285
Back!

18:40.385 --> 18:42.319
You teach martial arts here?

18:42.888 --> 18:44.321
Come in if you wanna learn.

18:45.157 --> 18:46.181
Who's the patriarch?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.651
I am.

18:50.429 --> 18:51.418
My name is Jin.

18:51.563 --> 18:54.396
I came here because Fo Shan 
is famous for martial arts.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.731
I'd like to practice with 
Fo Shan's martial artists.

18:59.738 --> 19:01.228
Practice?

19:01.440 --> 19:02.407
Yes!

19:03.609 --> 19:04.701
Provocation, more likely.

19:05.777 --> 19:07.142
I'm obliged.

19:07.379 --> 19:08.539
Okay!

19:08.847 --> 19:10.212
Stand aside.

19:10.315 --> 19:12.283
See how I'll beat these out-of-towners!

19:12.885 --> 19:14.477
Not here. Stand over there.

19:18.357 --> 19:19.483
What about it?

19:20.526 --> 19:21.618
Wait and see!

20:07.739 --> 20:09.536
Very good!

20:21.253 --> 20:22.345
Where's your master?

20:22.654 --> 20:24.212
Here!

21:14.940 --> 21:16.532
You wanna hack me to death?

21:21.647 --> 21:22.579
Our master is not here.

21:52.611 --> 21:56.445
The weather is so treacherous 
in Fo Shan these days.

21:59.618 --> 22:00.607
Let me...

22:07.893 --> 22:09.019
What are you drawing, Zhun?

22:13.532 --> 22:16.968
He's ignoring you. 
Spend more time with him.

22:18.737 --> 22:19.863
Okay.

22:30.749 --> 22:32.376
So early, Lin?

22:32.617 --> 22:33.534
Yes.

22:33.634 --> 22:36.382
I'm not here to fight. Just a few words.

22:46.565 --> 22:47.497
What's the matter?

22:48.400 --> 22:50.459
Some out-of-towners 
are provoking all the clubs.

22:51.536 --> 22:54.061
Their kung-fu is too good 
for all the masters.

22:54.473 --> 22:55.838
Can you look into that if you can?

22:57.409 --> 22:58.376
That good?

22:58.510 --> 22:59.499
Yes.

23:03.915 --> 23:05.678
I gotta go, Mrs. Ip.

23:53.765 --> 23:54.648
Hang in there, Master Liu!

23:54.748 --> 23:55.859
We depend on you, Master Liu!

24:21.760 --> 24:22.920
Damn it.

24:23.929 --> 24:25.726
No one in Fo Shan 
knows martial arts at all.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.629
I thought everyone 
was Wong Fei-hong here.

24:31.870 --> 24:32.996
It turns out you are just bums.

24:33.572 --> 24:35.130
You can't even fight, 
let alone defend yourselves.

24:35.874 --> 24:37.933
Brothers, 
our efforts have not been wasted.

24:38.543 --> 24:40.090
Nobody in Fo Shan knows martial arts,

24:40.190 --> 24:41.941
so we'll be rich this time.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.712
Brothers, let's keep it up.

24:45.884 --> 24:49.183
We open a club here 
to show them our might.

24:50.255 --> 24:51.882
We will be No.1 in Fo Shan!

24:53.024 --> 24:56.073
You think you're good 
by beating a few nitwits.

24:56.173 --> 24:57.890
Wait till you beat the best.

25:00.632 --> 25:01.826
Who's the best in Fo Shan?

25:01.933 --> 25:03.264
Ip Man, of course!

25:11.142 --> 25:11.972
Go!

25:12.244 --> 25:13.541
Come with us!

25:13.912 --> 25:15.777
See how we shall defeat Ip Man.

25:40.005 --> 25:42.166
Dad, there're lots of people outside.

25:43.909 --> 25:45.240
How can I help you?

25:49.948 --> 25:50.937
Sir... they...

25:51.049 --> 25:52.209
Are you Ip Man?

25:53.952 --> 25:56.534
I'm Jin. Heard that Fo Shan's 
famous for kung-fu.

25:56.634 --> 25:58.248
I understand, Master Jin. 
I understand.

25:58.623 --> 26:01.285
You bring a crowd here 
to challenge me to a duel?

26:01.693 --> 26:02.660
Of course.

26:02.827 --> 26:06.194
We're opening a club 
here to show our might.

26:06.731 --> 26:07.698
To open a martial club...

26:07.832 --> 26:10.995
you need a good site.
No need to fight with me.

26:11.169 --> 26:12.898
Please leave!

26:16.775 --> 26:19.335
Uncle Wang, take Zhun inside.

26:20.045 --> 26:20.909
Ip Man!

26:22.280 --> 26:25.807
Don't dillydally. Are you scared?

26:28.920 --> 26:30.888
You think our house is a martial club?

26:30.989 --> 26:32.889
Who's going to fight with you? Get lost!

26:33.058 --> 26:35.219
You heard that. I won't fight with you.

26:35.794 --> 26:37.022
Please leave immediately.

26:37.929 --> 26:40.363
I heard Wing Chun 
was invented by a woman.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.593
That suits you just right.

26:42.968 --> 26:45.368
Are you afraid of your wife, Ip?

26:46.871 --> 26:48.736
No men are afraid of their wives.

26:49.140 --> 26:51.074
There are only men who respect their wives.

26:52.777 --> 26:56.008
Don't worry, Mrs. Ip.
I won't beat him to death.

26:59.050 --> 27:01.348
If you fear he'll lose, 
I'll use only one hand.

27:02.821 --> 27:04.846
If that's not enough, 
I can use no hands at all.

27:05.824 --> 27:08.315
Fight with him, Master Ip! Beat him up!

27:08.660 --> 27:11.242
I'm too disappointed by Fo Shan. Damn it!

27:11.342 --> 27:12.342
So many martial artists 
but none of them good.

27:12.442 --> 27:13.260
Shut up!

27:16.234 --> 27:18.202
Don't break my things.

27:26.111 --> 27:28.341
Get out of my way!

27:35.887 --> 27:37.001
You rascals.

27:37.101 --> 27:38.135
You come at the right time.

27:38.235 --> 27:41.351
This place is too small.
Please get outside...

27:41.660 --> 27:42.854
and close the door on your way out.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.656
You have to redeem our honor.

27:52.370 --> 27:54.133
Ask them to leave. Hurry up!

27:57.442 --> 27:59.191
Can I just watch?

27:59.291 --> 28:00.141
Get out!

28:03.114 --> 28:04.445
Hurry up! Get out!

28:05.183 --> 28:06.775
Get out! Get out!

28:16.394 --> 28:18.760
Wing Chun, Ip Man.

28:19.798 --> 28:21.060
I really wanna see...

28:22.333 --> 28:26.099
how a man can fight like a woman.

28:28.339 --> 28:32.366
Good kung-fu does not
depend on age or sex

28:32.477 --> 28:34.707
but on how well you fight. 
You will know later.

29:13.985 --> 29:14.815
I'll pay!

29:16.387 --> 29:17.187
Good!

29:35.106 --> 29:36.004
I'll pay!

29:43.014 --> 29:45.331
Dad, Mom said if you 
don't start fighting,

29:45.431 --> 29:47.441
everything in the house will be broken.

29:48.052 --> 29:48.950
Okay.

29:52.556 --> 29:53.853
Little brat.

29:54.258 --> 29:55.589
Watch your language.

30:33.464 --> 30:34.381
Bro...

30:34.481 --> 30:35.659
Bro...

30:41.238 --> 30:43.433
You all right, Master Jin?

30:44.241 --> 30:45.230
I'm fine!

32:13.430 --> 32:14.419
How about that, Master Jin?

32:14.632 --> 32:16.429
My kung-fu isn't too bad, eh?

32:16.567 --> 32:17.556
That's enough.

32:19.136 --> 32:22.401
My northern boxing has 
lost to your southern one.

32:24.174 --> 32:26.608
No, it's not a matter of 
northern or southern style.

32:27.311 --> 32:28.403
The problem is you.

32:36.353 --> 32:37.479
So who won?

32:38.422 --> 32:41.687
Look how depressed he is. 
He must have lost.

32:42.726 --> 32:45.456
Get lost! Go back to your hometown!

32:46.363 --> 32:47.591
Get lost, you out-of-towners!

32:51.068 --> 32:52.797
Master! 
You fought very well, Ip!

32:53.070 --> 32:56.130
You've redeemed the 
honor of our martial clubs.

32:56.273 --> 32:57.399
I was just lucky...

32:57.508 --> 33:00.170
Don't be modest. 
You are Canton's treasure!

33:05.049 --> 33:05.733
Thank you.

33:05.833 --> 33:07.647
Take a look. It's imported.

33:07.751 --> 33:09.343
- Master Ip, flowers for your wife.
- Thanks

33:09.553 --> 33:10.747
How much, boss?

33:11.055 --> 33:12.135
On the house, Master Ip.

33:12.235 --> 33:14.122
I can't let you pay. 
You saved our honor.

33:14.258 --> 33:15.486
How can that be?

33:15.793 --> 33:16.725
You're running a business.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.059
Don't stand on ceremonies. 
Next time then.

33:18.362 --> 33:19.294
Okay, next time

33:19.730 --> 33:20.697
Fruits, Master Ip.

33:20.798 --> 33:22.732
- You're too kind. I can't... 
- For the kid.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.191
Thank you. 
Please come again. Goodbye.

33:25.769 --> 33:26.599
Buddy.

33:27.104 --> 33:28.353
- Say thank you.
- Take this.

33:28.453 --> 33:30.464
- Thank you.
- You're welcome... Farewell.

33:31.141 --> 33:32.092
How are you, Master Ip?

33:32.192 --> 33:33.059
How are you?

33:33.159 --> 33:34.075
How are you, Master Ip?

33:34.411 --> 33:35.343
That isn't bad at all.

33:35.579 --> 33:37.740
Yes, this is the best in our shop.

33:38.182 --> 33:38.982
Really?

33:39.550 --> 33:42.334
It's our honor if it can 
be placed in your house.

33:42.434 --> 33:43.443
Thank you.

33:45.356 --> 33:46.414
What's the occasion?

33:47.157 --> 33:48.351
Uncle Man. Auntie.

33:48.625 --> 33:50.855
So you plan on opening a martial club.

33:51.362 --> 33:52.852
Why didn't you inform me first?

33:53.263 --> 33:55.094
When did I say that?

33:55.366 --> 33:56.833
Everybody in Fo Shan knows about it.

33:57.167 --> 33:59.328
Everybody in Fo Shan but me.

34:00.504 --> 34:02.233
Let me help you, Uncle Man.

34:03.707 --> 34:08.542
Please accept me as 
your disciple, Master Ip.

34:09.112 --> 34:10.580
Master. 
Madam.

34:11.148 --> 34:11.632
Bro.

34:11.732 --> 34:13.445
You must be the one spreading the rumor.

34:13.684 --> 34:15.344
Keep order for me.

34:16.587 --> 34:18.554
Come. Go yourself.

34:20.524 --> 34:23.516
I don't care. 
Yao has to be your first disciple.

34:23.694 --> 34:26.254
Come on. You've known me long enough.

34:26.463 --> 34:27.725
I don't like having disciples.

34:27.831 --> 34:29.525
Be quiet.

34:29.766 --> 34:31.166
Stay in order.

34:32.168 --> 34:35.730
Stay in order and hail: 
Master Ip! Master Ip...

34:35.873 --> 34:51.619
Master Ip! Master Ip...

34:59.463 --> 35:02.796
On July 7, 1937, the Marco Polo Incident
broke out. Japan invaded China,

35:02.900 --> 35:03.693
robbing its people
of their livelihood

35:03.694 --> 35:04.731
and causing rampant starvation
all over the country.

35:59.590 --> 36:02.189
In October, 1938, Fo Shan 
was occupied by the Japanese army...

36:02.289 --> 36:04.727
...who destroyed factories,
infrastructures and buildings.

36:04.895 --> 36:09.491
The population of Fo Shan shrunk from
more than 300,000 to just over 70,000.

36:09.600 --> 36:14.435
Only a dozen factories in the whole city
remained in operation.

36:22.412 --> 36:24.491
Ip's residence was also confiscated

36:24.492 --> 36:27.699
and turned into the headquarters
of the Japanese army.

36:27.799 --> 36:31.652
Ip's family was rendered homeless,
living an abject existence.

37:32.082 --> 37:33.913
Cheng, I'll step out for a sec. 
Will be right back.

37:34.985 --> 37:36.418
Wait.

37:50.233 --> 37:52.201
It's cold outside. Wear a Jacket.

37:53.637 --> 37:56.105
Hurry up. Me this side, you that side.

38:04.348 --> 38:06.976
Be careful, Zhun. Don't hurt others.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.468
I'll give you more, Master Ip.

38:35.679 --> 38:36.839
Thank you.

38:37.547 --> 38:39.708
Don't push! One by one.

38:40.717 --> 38:41.809
Don't push.

38:42.419 --> 38:43.750
One by one.

38:47.724 --> 38:48.884
You get out of the way!

39:05.942 --> 39:09.400
The mill may be old 
but it's still productive.

39:15.118 --> 39:16.551
Fo Shan is very chaotic these days.

39:17.154 --> 39:19.122
You left already. Why did you come back?

39:19.990 --> 39:22.049
Who's going to feed 
the workers otherwise?

39:22.626 --> 39:24.924
All my money is invested in this mill.

39:26.463 --> 39:27.725
I can't pay you back for now.

39:28.932 --> 39:31.992
Don't worry. I almost forgot.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.834
No, I'll consider you a shareholder then.

39:35.038 --> 39:36.005
Let me calculate...

39:37.741 --> 39:39.174
you should have ten percent shares.

39:39.643 --> 39:40.701
It's really not necessary.

39:40.911 --> 39:44.005
Stay and help me out, 
now that you own it too.

39:46.183 --> 39:47.207
Uncle Ip.

39:47.851 --> 39:48.651
Yao.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.209
You'll be helping out? That's great!

39:50.487 --> 39:52.216
Everyone will be lively 
under your leadership.

39:53.090 --> 39:54.648
And I can watch you practice Wing Chun.

39:55.058 --> 39:57.925
Ip, stay for lunch. 
It's lunchtime for the workers.

39:58.862 --> 40:00.056
Yes, let's have lunch together.

40:00.897 --> 40:01.795
No, thanks.

40:02.666 --> 40:05.226
I can't. Next time.

40:05.702 --> 40:06.691
Goodbye.

40:17.647 --> 40:19.774
Dad, why didn't you 
ask Uncle Ip to stay?

40:21.218 --> 40:22.742
He doesn't like to owe people favors-

40:30.761 --> 40:33.646
Dad, you used to 
practice martial arts, right?

40:33.746 --> 40:35.664
Why did you stop?

40:36.833 --> 40:38.232
I get hungry when I exercise.

40:38.702 --> 40:40.533
So I need to exercise less, okay?

40:40.971 --> 40:44.600
Got it. I won't play outside from now on.

40:45.976 --> 40:48.625
You'll only stop playing today. Go eat.

40:48.725 --> 40:49.644
Hurry up and eat.

40:59.122 --> 41:00.783
This congee is a bit too thick.

41:02.592 --> 41:03.820
But you need to eat some.

41:10.901 --> 41:11.890
Be careful, it's hot.

41:20.010 --> 41:21.568
How much rice is left at home?

41:22.779 --> 41:23.803
Don't worry.

41:30.320 --> 41:33.847
I've pawned everything worth pawning.

41:35.192 --> 41:38.889
I am strong. I can look for a job.

41:39.196 --> 41:40.163
It's not the end of the world.

41:41.965 --> 41:43.227
You look for a job?

41:44.234 --> 41:47.897
I didn't need to work. 
But it's different now.

41:48.305 --> 41:50.170
There's always a first time.

41:54.244 --> 41:56.041
We have enough people here.

41:56.880 --> 41:58.814
We don't need to hire more. Sorry.

42:01.785 --> 42:03.719
Boss, are you hiring?

42:03.887 --> 42:04.979
No.

42:05.222 --> 42:06.189
Thank you.

42:08.124 --> 42:12.220
You want to hire me, Boss...

42:12.329 --> 42:13.694
Boss...

42:14.064 --> 42:16.328
You, you, you... Come up here...

42:16.666 --> 42:17.724
You want to hire me, Boss...

42:17.934 --> 42:19.128
Here.

42:22.806 --> 42:24.740
You're looking for a job, Master Ip?

42:24.841 --> 42:25.899
Come, come up...

42:26.109 --> 42:27.701
Thank you.

42:55.839 --> 42:56.771
Brother Ip!

43:04.681 --> 43:07.241
You can't dress like that to work.

43:08.018 --> 43:09.883
I didn't expect to pour coals here.

43:10.954 --> 43:12.148
How are you, Master Ip?

43:13.390 --> 43:14.414
How are you?

43:16.126 --> 43:17.286
How are you, Master Ip?

43:21.097 --> 43:22.655
So many martial club masters here?

43:23.266 --> 43:26.064
The boss here used
to practice martial arts too.

43:26.202 --> 43:29.729
That's why he likes 
to employ martial artists.

43:30.206 --> 43:32.299
By the way, are you still practicing?

43:34.010 --> 43:36.672
I'd rather use my 
time to scrape a living.

43:55.231 --> 43:57.961
I can't finish it all. Help me, okay?

43:58.969 --> 44:00.197
Eat some.

44:05.909 --> 44:08.776
How're your wife and son?

44:09.746 --> 44:10.974
They're fine. Thank you.

44:14.050 --> 44:15.915
Did you find your brother?

44:16.086 --> 44:18.213
I couldn't locate him since he left.

44:18.455 --> 44:19.717
Don't know if he's still alive.

44:21.491 --> 44:23.186
I didn't even have 
the chance to say I'm sorry.

44:31.167 --> 44:32.225
What have you lost?

44:32.435 --> 44:34.232
I lost an iron box.

44:34.471 --> 44:35.438
What iron box?

44:36.506 --> 44:37.495
Japanese solders are coming!

44:57.894 --> 44:58.952
Dear workers,

45:00.330 --> 45:01.456
this is Colonel Sato.

45:02.499 --> 45:04.865
He appreciates Chinese martial arts.

45:05.268 --> 45:07.293
He knows Fo Shan is 
famous for martial arts.

45:08.171 --> 45:11.937
He wants to find Chinese martial 
artists to fight with the Japanese.

45:13.243 --> 45:14.301
Would anyone want to go?

45:15.211 --> 45:16.143
Would anyone want to go?

45:20.517 --> 45:21.779
Would anyone want to go?

45:28.825 --> 45:29.625
Master?

45:34.397 --> 45:36.422
You want us to be sandbags?

45:36.566 --> 45:38.830
There's no door, I tell you!

45:40.470 --> 45:41.494
Airhead.

45:42.839 --> 45:44.238
Whoever wins will 
get one sack of rice.

45:47.277 --> 45:50.872
Whoever wins will 
get one sack of rice

45:51.014 --> 45:52.174
I'll do it!

45:53.016 --> 45:54.142
Lin...

45:54.851 --> 45:55.875
Don't get into trouble.

45:56.086 --> 45:58.145
I'm going too! Me too!

45:59.222 --> 46:01.972
They took all our rice. 
Now I can get them back.

46:02.072 --> 46:03.548
The world is fair.

46:07.997 --> 46:08.964
Forget it.

46:09.899 --> 46:10.923
Help me find the iron box.

46:15.371 --> 46:17.236
Let's go. It's okay. Come.

46:18.341 --> 46:19.205
Be careful.

46:19.342 --> 46:20.570
Come, let's line up.

46:20.944 --> 46:21.968
Come, come, come...

46:22.946 --> 46:24.379
Anything else?

46:25.548 --> 46:27.880
- No, let's go.
- Yes!

46:56.946 --> 46:58.004
Master?

47:00.350 --> 47:01.248
General.

47:33.550 --> 47:35.074
Thank you, General!

47:44.694 --> 47:46.161
Got to beat them all.

47:51.167 --> 47:53.601
Let me join in the fun.

47:55.705 --> 47:58.970
They're not good enough 
for General Miura.

48:00.109 --> 48:02.600
I'll show the Chinese what 
Japanese kung-fu's like.

48:04.414 --> 48:07.474
Find three men to fight with me.

48:08.451 --> 48:11.420
Give them rice even if they lose.

48:12.589 --> 48:13.389
Yes, sir!

48:16.392 --> 48:18.189
I've done you a favor again.

48:18.494 --> 48:21.588
General Miura will fight 
with three of you.

48:22.599 --> 48:25.966
You can get rice whether you win or not.

48:26.102 --> 48:28.468
The rice is not important. 
I just wanna beat them.

48:29.439 --> 48:30.303
Who will be going?

48:30.473 --> 48:31.997
I will...

48:32.175 --> 48:34.109
Let go of me... Stop shouting!

48:35.278 --> 48:36.973
Lin, you and you... 
The three of you.

48:37.180 --> 48:37.980
Okay!

49:37.106 --> 49:39.074
You've spit blood. 
Stop fighting.

49:40.743 --> 49:41.607
We've lost.

49:41.711 --> 49:45.408
General, they admitted defeat.

50:10.740 --> 50:13.106
Your really wanna die?

50:17.847 --> 50:19.781
You asshole!

50:35.365 --> 50:37.595
Lin, how are you? Lin...

50:37.700 --> 50:40.567
Lin...

50:54.317 --> 50:55.341
Were you tired today?

50:56.819 --> 50:58.446
Pouring coal is not tiring at all.

51:04.827 --> 51:06.226
I saw Lin today.

51:06.429 --> 51:08.397
Really? How is he?

51:08.798 --> 51:09.662
Not bad.

51:11.501 --> 51:12.866
I didn't expect to see him again.

51:38.361 --> 51:39.521
Master Li, Master Hong.

51:39.896 --> 51:40.563
Master Ip.

51:40.663 --> 51:42.222
Did you see Lin?

51:42.365 --> 51:44.299
Lin? No.

51:44.634 --> 51:45.692
No, I didn't.

51:46.302 --> 51:47.394
Let's eat first.

52:05.455 --> 52:06.717
Many of us received rice yesterday.

52:07.757 --> 52:10.590
General Miura was very satisfied.
Anybody wants to go today?

52:13.629 --> 52:14.618
Anybody? Li...

52:15.198 --> 52:16.392
Li...

52:16.799 --> 52:17.823
Where's Lin?

52:20.336 --> 52:21.394
Anybody wants to go?

52:21.504 --> 52:23.404
I'm asking you. Where's Lin?

52:24.440 --> 52:25.270
I don't know.

52:25.908 --> 52:28.468
Of course you do. 
You took him away.

52:29.679 --> 52:30.577
Anybody wants to go?

52:31.481 --> 52:32.573
You'll get rice if you win.

52:32.715 --> 52:33.545
Me!

52:34.250 --> 52:35.478
If Master Ip is going, I'll go too!

52:35.585 --> 52:36.745
Me too!

52:36.953 --> 52:38.853
I wanna have a good fight 
with the Japanese.

52:41.991 --> 52:43.571
Anything else I can do?

52:43.671 --> 52:45.251
No, you can go.

53:14.590 --> 53:15.488
Thanks.

53:17.660 --> 53:20.026
Can I fight three more people?

53:23.299 --> 53:25.733
He said he wanted to 
fight three more people.

54:38.341 --> 54:41.037
That's it for me...

55:01.764 --> 55:02.924
Why did you open fire?

55:06.068 --> 55:08.468
Li! Why did you open fire?

55:09.805 --> 55:12.433
Li! Why did you open fire?

55:12.608 --> 55:14.803
Who let you open fire?

55:15.911 --> 55:21.941
He took the rice even though he's lost.

55:22.084 --> 55:24.882
so... I wanted to teach him a lesson.

55:29.558 --> 55:31.890
This place is for tournaments only.

55:41.437 --> 55:44.964
Never open fire here anymore.

55:46.776 --> 55:48.004
Got it!

55:53.749 --> 55:56.946
Please calm down, General Miura.

55:57.887 --> 56:00.082
I'll arrange the next tournament for you.

56:03.492 --> 56:04.550
Continue!

56:19.542 --> 56:20.634
Who else wants to fight?

56:20.843 --> 56:21.673
Me!

56:22.545 --> 56:24.604
Li! Open the gate!

56:28.984 --> 56:30.781
Master... Open the gate!

56:32.655 --> 56:36.147
Tell me, was Lin beaten to death?

56:40.629 --> 56:41.857
Open the gate.

56:42.131 --> 56:42.947
Master...

56:43.047 --> 56:43.862
Open the gate!

56:46.001 --> 56:47.628
Please open the gate.

57:02.818 --> 57:04.479
I wanna fight ten people!

57:05.187 --> 57:06.620
You crazy? Please don't.

57:06.722 --> 57:07.984
I wanna fight ten people!

57:15.131 --> 57:18.259
He said he wanted to fight ten people.

57:26.275 --> 57:27.105
Ten?

57:29.712 --> 57:30.701
Yes

57:32.248 --> 57:33.772
Let's see how good he is.

57:38.687 --> 57:39.551
Unit 5!

57:40.589 --> 57:42.989
Unit 1, Unit 3, Unit 5.

57:43.793 --> 57:44.919
Start!

57:48.898 --> 57:49.865
Be careful

01:00:25.888 --> 01:00:26.855
Stay back!

01:00:48.110 --> 01:00:49.008
Come back again.

01:00:50.245 --> 01:00:51.109
He wants you to come back again.

01:00:53.115 --> 01:00:54.742
I'm not here for the rice.

01:00:57.019 --> 01:00:59.419
He said... he would come back.

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.420
What's your name?

01:01:07.095 --> 01:01:08.062
He wants to know your name.

01:01:15.103 --> 01:01:17.230
I'm just a Chinese.

01:01:20.308 --> 01:01:22.742
His name is Ip Man.

01:01:55.443 --> 01:01:56.535
Be careful in the future.

01:01:57.979 --> 01:01:59.446
I don't know what Miura might do.

01:02:04.519 --> 01:02:05.349
Lackey!

01:02:07.122 --> 01:02:08.214
Why am I a lackey?

01:02:09.324 --> 01:02:12.885
Their deaths got nothing to do with me.
I'm just an interpreter.

01:02:13.461 --> 01:02:15.395
I need to scrape a living too!

01:02:16.164 --> 01:02:17.028
Scrape a living?

01:02:18.366 --> 01:02:21.062
You watch your countrymen get beaten 
to death. Where's your dignity?

01:02:25.507 --> 01:02:26.371
I don't have any.

01:02:27.108 --> 01:02:28.166
You do. You have lots of it.

01:02:29.144 --> 01:02:30.907
If you have the guts, go beat them up!

01:02:31.079 --> 01:02:33.047
Beat as many as you can!

01:02:33.848 --> 01:02:36.339
I'm an interpreter, not a lackey...

01:02:37.152 --> 01:02:39.313
I'm a Chinese!

01:03:36.044 --> 01:03:37.068
I'm back.

01:03:37.278 --> 01:03:38.229
Daddy.

01:03:38.329 --> 01:03:39.280
You're back?

01:03:41.149 --> 01:03:42.138
Have you been good?

01:03:42.350 --> 01:03:43.150
Yes.

01:03:43.952 --> 01:03:44.752
Good boy.

01:03:48.156 --> 01:03:49.145
Are you tired today?

01:04:11.112 --> 01:04:12.204
Go wash your face first.

01:05:13.541 --> 01:05:14.974
You're so good.

01:05:24.118 --> 01:05:26.279
I realize today I'm useless.

01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:33.391
I can't do anything.

01:05:38.566 --> 01:05:40.090
I practiced marital arts before.

01:05:43.071 --> 01:05:43.871
But so what?

01:05:50.678 --> 01:05:51.667
This world...

01:05:57.318 --> 01:05:58.615
is minuscule.

01:06:02.357 --> 01:06:03.585
I'm so useless.

01:06:06.361 --> 01:06:08.056
I don't care what the world is like.

01:06:09.264 --> 01:06:12.324
I only know I'm very happy now.

01:06:15.136 --> 01:06:18.594
As long as you, me, and Zhun...

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:23.101
can stay together, 
everything will be okay.

01:06:27.148 --> 01:06:28.775
It's essential for a 
family to stay together.

01:06:59.781 --> 01:07:02.249
Get off! Get off!

01:07:02.817 --> 01:07:04.444
Get off...

01:07:04.752 --> 01:07:06.481
Stand over there! On the side!

01:07:06.587 --> 01:07:07.611
Stand over there...

01:07:32.146 --> 01:07:34.171
Who's the boss? Come out!

01:07:38.753 --> 01:07:39.720
I am.

01:07:49.831 --> 01:07:53.232
I just took your goods. 
You can buy them back.

01:07:53.334 --> 01:07:54.528
Is that okay?

01:07:55.737 --> 01:07:56.669
I don't have money.

01:07:58.706 --> 01:08:00.196
Don't beat my dad anymore!

01:08:02.643 --> 01:08:03.610
Wing Chun?

01:08:08.816 --> 01:08:09.874
Damn it! Wing Chun?

01:08:10.184 --> 01:08:11.481
Don't beat him!

01:08:15.323 --> 01:08:16.122
Do you have money?

01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:17.442
I don't.

01:08:17.542 --> 01:08:18.341
Do you?

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:20.227
No...

01:08:20.327 --> 01:08:21.386
I'll keep beating you till you have!

01:08:29.303 --> 01:08:30.201
The goods haven't been sold...

01:08:31.506 --> 01:08:32.803
I don't have money.

01:08:37.645 --> 01:08:39.475
Uncle Ip! Uncle Ip...

01:08:39.947 --> 01:08:42.541
Please save my dad. 
He's almost beaten to death.

01:08:43.216 --> 01:08:44.017
What's the matter, Yao?

01:08:44.218 --> 01:08:44.669
Auntie.

01:08:44.769 --> 01:08:46.482
Let me go see what happens. 
It's okay.

01:08:56.497 --> 01:08:59.694
I'm very reasonable.

01:09:00.501 --> 01:09:01.899
It's fine if you don't have money now.

01:09:02.603 --> 01:09:04.434
I'll give you some time to raise it.

01:09:04.839 --> 01:09:06.328
As for the goods, I'll keep them for now.

01:09:24.826 --> 01:09:25.850
Master Ip.

01:09:29.263 --> 01:09:30.389
Dad, are you okay?

01:09:30.832 --> 01:09:32.993
I'm fine. Go help Uncle Fu.

01:09:52.319 --> 01:09:53.412
How can I help?

01:09:55.289 --> 01:09:58.019
I thought your martial 
arts were impractical.

01:09:58.726 --> 01:10:00.250
Now I know it's very useful.

01:10:01.696 --> 01:10:04.392
I should've learnt some 
martial arts from you.

01:10:04.699 --> 01:10:05.961
At least I can defend myself.

01:10:07.502 --> 01:10:10.369
Uncle Ip, 
please stay and teach us martial arts,

01:10:10.805 --> 01:10:13.433
so that we can defend ourselves.

01:10:14.942 --> 01:10:16.239
Master Ip.

01:10:17.311 --> 01:10:20.280
You're such an expert. Please teach us.

01:10:20.548 --> 01:10:24.450
Yes, Master Ip. Please teach us.

01:10:28.589 --> 01:10:29.715
I'm a businessman.

01:10:31.559 --> 01:10:32.890
I know nothing other 
than running a business.

01:10:33.828 --> 01:10:36.490
I can't protect them, but you can.

01:10:38.666 --> 01:10:40.998
In peaceful days, 
it's okay if you refused to teach.

01:10:42.036 --> 01:10:45.870
But in bad times now, 
shouldn't you do something?

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:50.809
Teaching martial arts is very costly.

01:10:51.913 --> 01:10:55.041
Are you paying their fees? 
You owe me again?

01:11:01.656 --> 01:11:04.056
Uncle Ip, I'll be your first disciple.

01:12:20.001 --> 01:12:21.662
Dad, I wanna be taller.

01:12:22.036 --> 01:12:23.401
Taller?

01:12:36.817 --> 01:12:38.682
Why hasn't Ip Man come back?

01:12:41.022 --> 01:12:45.015
I... I don't know...

01:12:46.427 --> 01:12:47.485
Find him.

01:12:49.697 --> 01:12:54.691
I don't know where he is.

01:12:54.869 --> 01:12:56.097
I don't know how to find him.

01:12:56.437 --> 01:12:57.768
How big is Fo Shan?

01:12:58.839 --> 01:13:00.101
How difficult can it be to find him?

01:13:02.610 --> 01:13:05.602
Fo Shan is indeed very big.

01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:12.319
No...

01:13:13.688 --> 01:13:14.620
Please don't...

01:13:18.826 --> 01:13:20.726
I really don't know where he is...

01:13:24.465 --> 01:13:25.955
Useless thing! Enough!

01:13:32.973 --> 01:13:33.803
Asshole!

01:13:34.208 --> 01:13:35.766
Paper, stone, scissors!

01:13:36.644 --> 01:13:38.475
You lost.
You colluded?

01:13:40.614 --> 01:13:41.740
Hide well.

01:13:43.517 --> 01:13:45.644
10, 9, 8, 7...

01:13:45.853 --> 01:13:46.683
Zhun.

01:13:47.722 --> 01:13:48.105
That way.

01:13:48.205 --> 01:13:50.089
3, 2, 1

01:13:50.858 --> 01:13:53.190
I'm coming. I'll find you guys

01:13:57.031 --> 01:13:57.831
Master.

01:13:58.099 --> 01:13:58.899
What're you here for?

01:14:01.502 --> 01:14:02.730
Miura wants you to go back and fight him.

01:14:06.207 --> 01:14:07.007
Go away.

01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.910
I can't.

01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.560
Why not?

01:14:27.194 --> 01:14:28.889
Why not? What do you want?

01:14:30.698 --> 01:14:31.858
What do you want?

01:14:37.571 --> 01:14:38.697
How pretty!

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.360
Shit.

01:15:02.596 --> 01:15:04.894
Let's go. It's not safe here.

01:15:24.585 --> 01:15:26.018
Let's go, Cheng.

01:15:33.794 --> 01:15:34.658
Li.

01:15:53.647 --> 01:15:56.775
You're a piece of shit!

01:15:56.917 --> 01:15:59.302
How could you let Ip run away?

01:15:59.402 --> 01:16:01.081
I'm sorry...

01:16:02.756 --> 01:16:06.192
Even Colonel Sato could not stop him...

01:16:06.727 --> 01:16:13.724
I've tried my best already...

01:16:15.035 --> 01:16:15.952
Sorry.

01:16:16.052 --> 01:16:17.060
Shut up!

01:16:17.238 --> 01:16:20.105
Utterly useless!

01:16:21.876 --> 01:16:22.968
Tell them...

01:16:27.081 --> 01:16:28.412
to dig Ip out! This is an order.

01:16:29.817 --> 01:16:30.617
Yes, sir.

01:16:45.165 --> 01:16:45.965
Little Sis.

01:16:50.971 --> 01:16:52.404
Brother, eat something.

01:17:01.448 --> 01:17:02.248
How's the master?

01:17:02.850 --> 01:17:04.317
Okay. They are all fine.

01:17:11.158 --> 01:17:12.056
Master.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:13.560
Coming...

01:17:17.264 --> 01:17:18.253
Madam.

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.192
See if it fits?

01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:24.997
So are you well adapted here?

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:26.840
Yes.

01:17:27.207 --> 01:17:28.333
That's good.

01:17:28.742 --> 01:17:29.970
I'll let you know when the meal is ready.

01:17:31.011 --> 01:17:31.841
Li...

01:17:35.950 --> 01:17:36.814
I'm fine.

01:17:39.119 --> 01:17:40.211
I really don't know what to say.

01:17:42.389 --> 01:17:43.189
Thank you.

01:17:44.992 --> 01:17:45.792
It's okay.

01:18:09.183 --> 01:18:10.878
We better leave Fo Shan 
as soon as possible.

01:18:13.053 --> 01:18:14.520
Quan is trying to find a solution for us.

01:18:15.055 --> 01:18:15.987
Where shall we go?

01:18:16.757 --> 01:18:17.557
Hong Kong.

01:18:18.359 --> 01:18:20.384
In fact, it doesn't matter where.

01:18:25.466 --> 01:18:27.229
I still have some friends in Hong Kong.

01:18:29.403 --> 01:18:30.802
If something happens to me...

01:18:31.772 --> 01:18:32.830
What can happen to you?

01:18:34.174 --> 01:18:35.402
Nothing will happen to you.

01:18:40.214 --> 01:18:42.011
They are here again! Let's scram!

01:18:56.997 --> 01:18:59.158
They are here! They are here!

01:19:08.042 --> 01:19:10.067
Have zou got the money?

01:19:10.377 --> 01:19:11.935
We won't give you money!

01:19:13.981 --> 01:19:15.005
What did you say?

01:19:17.251 --> 01:19:19.515
I'm not afraid of you! 
You can't bully us!

01:19:21.221 --> 01:19:23.086
You want me to beat you up?

01:19:29.063 --> 01:19:31.258
Damn it! Whoever dares to resist...

01:19:31.999 --> 01:19:32.897
just beat him up!

01:20:21.081 --> 01:20:22.309
Stop it!

01:20:35.963 --> 01:20:37.225
No wonder they dare to resist.

01:20:38.298 --> 01:20:39.595
They've found a bodyguard.

01:20:40.501 --> 01:20:43.265
You spurned me for 
opening a club in Fo Shan.

01:20:45.072 --> 01:20:47.063
And today, you wanna mess with me again?

01:20:48.041 --> 01:20:50.305
You wanna chase me away?

01:20:51.011 --> 01:20:52.000
No one wants to chase you away.

01:20:52.312 --> 01:20:56.214
Ip, have you ever been hungry every day?

01:20:58.252 --> 01:21:00.243
Everybody is hungry nowadays.

01:21:02.022 --> 01:21:04.582
The first day I came to 
Fo Shan, I told myself...

01:21:06.126 --> 01:21:07.388
I would never be hungry again.

01:21:08.529 --> 01:21:10.019
I will never be hungry again!

01:21:10.464 --> 01:21:11.362
Keep beating!

01:21:19.606 --> 01:21:20.436
Beat them!

01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:25.363
Yuan, why you still idling here? Go!

01:22:30.244 --> 01:22:31.176
Kill them!

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:34.669
Kill them!

01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:47.658
Go.

01:22:48.095 --> 01:22:49.653
How can we get near him?

01:23:43.784 --> 01:23:44.842
Let's go!

01:23:48.555 --> 01:23:50.182
Master, you were so good!

01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.824
Yuan.

01:24:04.371 --> 01:24:05.201
Stop there!

01:24:13.814 --> 01:24:15.213
You know what you're doing?

01:24:15.415 --> 01:24:17.178
I know. I'm a robber.

01:24:18.185 --> 01:24:19.413
You're robbing the Chinese.

01:24:19.686 --> 01:24:21.779
I'd rather be the bully than the bullied.

01:24:22.122 --> 01:24:23.180
I want everyone to be scared of me!

01:24:26.894 --> 01:24:29.158
Your brother asked me to give this...
Don't talk about him!

01:24:34.235 --> 01:24:35.395
You know your brother is dead?

01:24:36.437 --> 01:24:37.699
He's beaten to death by the Japanese.

01:24:45.479 --> 01:24:49.245
He looked for you everywhere 
but couldn't find you.

01:24:52.353 --> 01:24:56.221
Everyone needs to choose his own path.

01:26:07.361 --> 01:26:08.161
Master.

01:26:09.630 --> 01:26:12.347
That guy told Miura 
you're at the cotton mill.

01:26:12.447 --> 01:26:13.798
Don't go back, ok?

01:26:14.802 --> 01:26:17.270
I gotta go. 
Remember, don't go back.

01:26:44.598 --> 01:26:54.701
Scram! Hurry up!

01:26:56.510 --> 01:26:57.670
Where's Ip Man?

01:26:59.513 --> 01:27:01.344
Where's Ip Man? Tell me!

01:27:02.916 --> 01:27:04.577
Don't say a word.

01:27:07.454 --> 01:27:08.887
You, come here.

01:27:11.659 --> 01:27:13.024
Where's Ip Man?

01:27:13.861 --> 01:27:15.795
Tell me!

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:18.456
I'm asking you!

01:27:18.699 --> 01:27:20.064
Hang in there. I'll figure something out.

01:27:21.568 --> 01:27:22.368
Speak!

01:27:22.436 --> 01:27:24.354
Speak! Speak up...

01:27:24.454 --> 01:27:27.430
I'm here! I'm Ip Man...

01:27:27.975 --> 01:27:29.602
I'm here... Li!

01:27:31.011 --> 01:27:32.501
Wait! Wait!

01:27:32.613 --> 01:27:34.410
Please wait!

01:27:34.515 --> 01:27:37.712
Li, tell Miura the workers are innocent.

01:27:38.419 --> 01:27:39.943
Ask Miura to release them.

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:41.601
I told you not to come back. 
Why did you?

01:27:41.701 --> 01:27:42.621
Tell him!

01:27:42.823 --> 01:27:44.017
Shit!

01:27:48.429 --> 01:27:49.361
Sato!

01:27:52.966 --> 01:27:56.684
He dares to hit me... 
Can't we put him to death?

01:27:56.784 --> 01:27:57.998
I know what I'm doing.

01:27:58.839 --> 01:27:59.931
- Li. 
- Yes.

01:28:01.742 --> 01:28:06.076
Since the day you resisted 
the Japanese army,

01:28:06.413 --> 01:28:09.541
you've already been a dead man.

01:28:10.517 --> 01:28:15.477
But you're talented, 
you can be useful to us.

01:28:15.889 --> 01:28:25.389
So I'll give you one chance to be loyal
to the Japanese Emperor.

01:28:25.666 --> 01:28:29.534
Teach our army Chinese kung-fu.

01:28:30.571 --> 01:28:33.938
That way, we might still spare your life.

01:28:36.076 --> 01:28:39.477
He wanted you to teach 
the Japanese kung-fu.

01:28:41.682 --> 01:28:43.149
I won't teach the Japanese.

01:28:44.151 --> 01:28:48.019
You wanna see me fight? 
I'll fight with you.

01:28:55.963 --> 01:28:59.490
He said he would think about it.

01:28:59.633 --> 01:29:05.196
He wants to have a 
duel with General Miura.

01:29:07.641 --> 01:29:08.767
Take him away!

01:29:10.110 --> 01:29:11.008
Take him away!

01:29:17.718 --> 01:29:20.152
Quan, take my wife 
and kid away from Fo Shan.

01:29:22.022 --> 01:29:26.049
Master Ip...

01:29:31.031 --> 01:29:34.023
General, you really wanna fight with Ip?

01:29:34.601 --> 01:29:35.625
Of course.

01:29:36.170 --> 01:29:38.195
He's an expert.

01:29:38.839 --> 01:29:40.238
But he doesn't look like...

01:29:40.908 --> 01:29:43.741
he wants to teach the Imperial Army.

01:29:44.111 --> 01:29:47.603
He must have other motives 
trying to fight with you.

01:29:48.048 --> 01:29:51.745
General, don't fight with him.

01:29:52.519 --> 01:29:55.113
Let me simply shoot him dead.

01:29:59.693 --> 01:30:05.893
He challenges me to a fight...

01:30:07.768 --> 01:30:09.565
because he thinks he's better than me.

01:30:12.072 --> 01:30:13.903
If I refuse to accept the challenge...

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:21.078
but shoot him instead...

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:29.584
isn't that the same as admitting defeat?

01:30:30.190 --> 01:30:32.784
Fighting with a Chinese...

01:30:33.660 --> 01:30:36.686
is not just a matter of 
personal honor for you.

01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:40.883
It has to do with the 
national honor of our Empire.

01:30:40.983 --> 01:30:43.095
Are you saying I will lose?

01:30:43.804 --> 01:30:46.898
I only fear for the worst.

01:30:47.107 --> 01:30:48.802
I will win for sure.

01:30:49.743 --> 01:30:51.938
I'll let the whole China know I've won.

01:30:52.913 --> 01:30:55.609
Yes! I understand!

01:31:32.152 --> 01:31:38.113
I want you to teach us 
instead of killing you,

01:31:39.593 --> 01:31:41.220
because I appreciate your talent.

01:31:41.328 --> 01:31:47.858
But I don't think Chinese kung-fu
is better than Japanese.

01:31:50.904 --> 01:31:53.896
We will fight in front of everybody.

01:31:54.608 --> 01:31:56.940
That's why we need a fair tournament.

01:31:58.812 --> 01:32:03.146
You invaded our country 
and killed our people.

01:32:07.321 --> 01:32:09.050
Stop being hypocritical.

01:32:12.993 --> 01:32:14.017
Excuse me.

01:32:31.044 --> 01:32:33.012
Let go of me! Let me go back! 
Let go of my mom...

01:32:33.113 --> 01:32:36.241
I promised Ip nothing 
would happen to you.

01:32:36.917 --> 01:32:38.077
It's too dangerous to go back.

01:32:45.292 --> 01:32:46.974
I heard the Japanese 
are fighting the Chinese.

01:32:47.074 --> 01:32:48.275
- Who's fighting? 
- Ip Man.

01:32:48.375 --> 01:32:50.057
Look, the whole place is sealed up now.

01:32:57.404 --> 01:32:58.336
In the past...

01:32:59.973 --> 01:33:01.964
I wished he could be with me every day.

01:33:03.977 --> 01:33:06.207
So I always complained 
about his practice.

01:33:08.915 --> 01:33:11.008
Every time he had a duel with someone...

01:33:12.252 --> 01:33:13.742
I would throw a tantrum.

01:33:16.890 --> 01:33:20.155
I never truly supported him

01:33:20.694 --> 01:33:22.685
doing what he liked.

01:33:24.064 --> 01:33:24.962
Now...

01:33:25.966 --> 01:33:29.026
This could be his last duel.

01:33:32.172 --> 01:33:34.936
I fear there won't be another chance.

01:33:35.909 --> 01:33:38.469
Why don't you give me this chance?

01:33:39.279 --> 01:33:40.803
Why?

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:50.145
General Miura says...

01:33:51.858 --> 01:33:53.485
For the sake of Sino-Japanese 
cultural exchange,

01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:57.025
he is having a fair tournament 
with Master Ip today...

01:33:57.931 --> 01:34:01.025
to share their knowledge 
in a friendly manner,

01:34:01.935 --> 01:34:03.334
and to bring true peace 
between the two countries.

01:34:04.204 --> 01:34:06.365
Fair tournament? Is that possible?

01:34:08.442 --> 01:34:11.206
That traitor will surely 
be killed by the Japanese.

01:34:11.311 --> 01:34:12.778
That's right.

01:34:13.914 --> 01:34:15.074
Shut up!

01:34:21.188 --> 01:34:22.155
Here comes Master Ip!

01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:37.436
General Miura talked about a tournament.

01:34:38.004 --> 01:34:39.528
But I don't give a damn!

01:34:40.140 --> 01:34:41.266
Listen up.

01:34:41.775 --> 01:34:45.836
If you win,

01:34:46.346 --> 01:34:49.247
I will kill you.

01:34:49.349 --> 01:34:50.232
Remember this!

01:34:50.332 --> 01:34:51.132
Yes!

01:34:54.054 --> 01:34:55.783
You better let Miura win later...

01:34:56.423 --> 01:34:57.981
or he won't let you live.

01:35:00.494 --> 01:35:02.052
It's more important to stay alive.

01:35:05.465 --> 01:35:07.433
Although martial arts 
involves armed forces,

01:35:08.268 --> 01:35:11.237
Chinese martial arts 
is Confucian in spirit.

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:14.463
The virtue of martial arts
is benevolence.

01:35:15.275 --> 01:35:16.889
You Japanese will never
understand the principle...

01:35:16.890 --> 01:35:18.438
of treating other people
as you would yourselves.

01:35:19.446 --> 01:35:21.004
Because you abuse military power.

01:35:21.114 --> 01:35:23.048
You turned it into violence 
to oppress others.

01:35:24.217 --> 01:35:26.242
You don't deserve to learn 
Chinese martial arts.

01:38:57.297 --> 01:39:20.280
Ip Man! Ip Man!

01:41:43.563 --> 01:41:47.829
Ip Man refused to be subjugated 
by the Japanese army...

01:41:48.234 --> 01:41:53.501
...and used his fists to call forth
the unity of the Chinese people.

01:41:57.510 --> 01:42:00.741
Assisted by his good 
friend Zhou Qingquan,

01:42:00.947 --> 01:42:06.408
the wounded Ip Man successfully
fled Fo Shan with his wife and son.

01:42:12.325 --> 01:42:15.453
On August 15, 1945,

01:42:15.929 --> 01:42:19.681
Emperor Hirohito of Japan announced that
Japan would surrender unconditionally.

01:42:19.781 --> 01:42:25.466
The Chinese finally won and ended a war
that lasted eight long years.

01:42:28.708 --> 01:42:31.973
In 1949, the Grandmaster Ip Man
settled in Hong Kong.

01:42:32.579 --> 01:42:34.872
He started his first Wing Chun class

01:42:34.873 --> 01:42:37.846
at Kowloon Hotel's Staff
Association Headquarters,

01:42:37.984 --> 01:42:41.545
turning a new leaf in his life.

01:42:41.921 --> 01:42:44.981
In 1967, Grandmaster Ip Man started the
Wing Chun Athletic Association to foster...

01:42:45.391 --> 01:42:47.757
...the spirit of Wing Chun
with a group of like-minded enthusiasts,

01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:52.490
fulfilling the most cherished dream
of his later years.

01:42:54.601 --> 01:42:59.595
Until now, Wing Chun has become a world
renowned branch of Chinese martial arts.

01:42:59.939 --> 01:43:05.935
The lineage of Grandmaster Ip Man's
disciples has exceeded 2 million people.

01:43:06.746 --> 01:43:12.844
There are lots of talented people
among his disciples,

01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:23.891
including the most illustrious
action star of all, Bruce Lee.
