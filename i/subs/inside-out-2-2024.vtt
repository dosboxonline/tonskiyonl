WEBVTT

01:20.042 --> 01:24.000
Let's play some hockey!

01:30.667 --> 01:34.167
This is Joy, coming to you live
in Riley's mind…

01:34.333 --> 01:38.833
and we are expecting a great championship
today with the Foghorns.

01:39.000 --> 01:40.917
Riley fans, get up on your feet…

01:41.083 --> 01:43.917
and make some noise!

01:44.333 --> 01:45.333
Go, go, go!

01:45.500 --> 01:47.250
Let's go, Foghorns!

01:49.083 --> 01:50.083
Bring it in!

01:50.250 --> 01:51.500
Foghorns on three.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.833
-One, two, three…
-Foghorns!

02:01.417 --> 02:06.375
Now, it's time to greet your Team Riley!

02:06.542 --> 02:09.708
Playing in his 13th year,
and fresh from the penalty box…

02:09.875 --> 02:11.708
it's Riley's Anger!

02:11.875 --> 02:12.875
Let me at 'em!

02:21.417 --> 02:22.792
Helmet, pads, gloves…

02:22.958 --> 02:25.125
safety checklist is complete.

02:25.292 --> 02:27.583
It should be nothing
but smooth sailing from…

02:27.750 --> 02:28.958
Look out!

02:30.000 --> 02:32.375
And that's Fear, keeping Riley on her toes.

02:32.542 --> 02:34.792
We gotta get our mouth guard, people.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.375
No, no, no! That's not ours!

02:39.417 --> 02:41.792
And that, folks, is the infamous Disgust.

02:41.958 --> 02:43.292
Glad to have her on our team.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.792
Twenty-eight. Andersen, tripping.

02:47.958 --> 02:49.167
Oh, no…

02:49.333 --> 02:50.833
And bringing up the rear…

02:51.000 --> 02:52.583
you know her, you love her…

02:52.750 --> 02:55.000
the one, the only…

02:55.167 --> 02:57.167
We got a penalty.

02:57.625 --> 03:00.750
That's right, Sadness is in the house!

03:00.917 --> 03:01.917
Yay…

03:02.083 --> 03:03.958
Andersen goes to the box.

03:04.125 --> 03:05.333
Two minutes for tripping.

03:05.500 --> 03:09.083
Okay, looks like we have a couple of minutes
while Riley takes a breather.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.250
Let me catch you up.

03:10.750 --> 03:13.125
Riley is still exceptional.

03:13.292 --> 03:14.292
Ta-da!

03:14.458 --> 03:15.458
Yum.

03:15.625 --> 03:17.583
And not just because
she's the top of her class…

03:17.750 --> 03:19.625
-Riley Andersen.
-…which, by the way, she is.

03:19.792 --> 03:21.208
Riley, Riley, over here!

03:21.375 --> 03:23.667
She's also really kind…

03:23.833 --> 03:25.875
and she's nice to stray cats.

03:26.042 --> 03:27.167
I mean, come on.

03:27.708 --> 03:30.250
And she's officially a teenager now.

03:30.417 --> 03:32.250
She got very tall, very fast.

03:32.500 --> 03:34.208
Did we grow overnight?

03:34.708 --> 03:37.042
That was our favorite shirt.

03:37.208 --> 03:40.500
We even got braces with extra rubber bands!

03:40.667 --> 03:42.333
-How does it feel?
-Great!

03:42.833 --> 03:43.750
Sorry.

03:43.917 --> 03:47.458
Riley's Personality Islands
are still going strong.

03:47.625 --> 03:50.125
Glad to see Boy Band Island
finally broke up.

03:50.292 --> 03:52.625
But Goofball is still monkeying around.

03:53.208 --> 03:54.708
Wait, where's Family Island?

03:54.875 --> 03:56.292
It's right there.

03:57.875 --> 03:59.333
There it is.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.542
What's that blocking it?

04:01.708 --> 04:02.833
That's Friendship Island.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.292
Isn't it amazing?

04:04.458 --> 04:08.792
But we realized her islands
aren't the only things made by memories.

04:08.958 --> 04:14.083
Way down, at the root level,
these memories were also creating beliefs.

04:14.250 --> 04:16.166
Homework should be illegal.

04:17.708 --> 04:20.625
Get Up and Glow is the best band ever!

04:20.791 --> 04:22.625
And my personal favorite…

04:22.792 --> 04:24.292
I'm a really good friend.

04:24.458 --> 04:29.250
Did you know the change in your couch
could change the world? Oh, no!

04:33.750 --> 04:35.083
Oh, no, we should do something.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.125
No! That girl is a social Titanic.

04:37.292 --> 04:38.292
Do not get on that ship.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.208
Guys…

04:40.917 --> 04:41.958
Wow.

04:43.375 --> 04:45.625
That is so pretty.

04:48.667 --> 04:51.708
It's okay. I drop things all the time.

04:55.667 --> 04:56.917
I'm Riley.

04:57.542 --> 04:58.833
I'm Grace.

04:59.750 --> 05:00.792
I'm Bree.

05:02.708 --> 05:04.792
Turns out, when you put
all of those beliefs together…

05:04.958 --> 05:07.375
they make the most wonderful thing of all.

05:07.542 --> 05:09.167
Her Sense of Self.

05:09.500 --> 05:11.083
I'm a good person.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.917
It's what helps Riley make good choices.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.375
Thirteen years of hard work…

05:16.542 --> 05:20.667
all wrapped up in what some might call
our masterpiece.

05:20.833 --> 05:22.833
You know, one of the hardest challenges
we found…

05:23.000 --> 05:24.208
Oh, my gosh! We're back in the game.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.792
We're tied.

05:26.958 --> 05:28.250
How are we gonna score in time?

05:28.417 --> 05:31.667
-We use our slap shot!
-No, no, no. We charge the goalie!

05:31.833 --> 05:33.917
But Grace hasn't scored yet.

05:35.958 --> 05:37.167
Riley's got this.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.000
Thread the needle!

05:43.542 --> 05:44.708
Come on, Riley.

06:10.833 --> 06:12.083
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about!

06:12.250 --> 06:13.875
Look at that! That's my girl!

06:14.042 --> 06:16.875
And the Foghorns win the championship!

06:22.458 --> 06:24.333
-She shoots and she scores!
-Champions, baby!

06:24.500 --> 06:25.500
Hey, girls.

06:25.667 --> 06:27.375
Congratulations on your win.

06:27.542 --> 06:29.167
That's the high school coach!

06:29.958 --> 06:31.375
What a game!

06:31.542 --> 06:32.750
That last play?

06:33.292 --> 06:35.208
The three of you were impressive.

06:35.375 --> 06:36.583
Thanks, Coach Roberts.

06:36.750 --> 06:37.958
Look, it's last minute…

06:38.125 --> 06:41.083
but every year, I do a three-day skills camp.

06:41.167 --> 06:43.000
I invite all the best players in the area.

06:43.167 --> 06:45.083
I'd love for you girls to come.

06:45.875 --> 06:47.167
Are we in a dream right now?

06:47.333 --> 06:48.792
Please, can somebody pinch me?

06:50.083 --> 06:51.083
Definitely awake.

06:51.250 --> 06:54.750
If we impress Coach, she'll put
the three of us on the team next year.

06:54.917 --> 06:56.125
The Fire Hawks!

06:56.292 --> 06:58.958
Finally, a team I can get behind.

06:59.125 --> 07:00.333
What do you say?

07:00.500 --> 07:01.833
-Yes!
-Absolutely yes.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.083
-We're there!
-Thank you, thank you, thank you!

07:03.250 --> 07:05.000
Great. We'll see you tomorrow.

07:05.750 --> 07:06.833
This is amazing!

07:12.542 --> 07:14.125
What a big day!

07:14.292 --> 07:15.667
You are such an all-star!

07:15.833 --> 07:18.042
You are gonna knock the coach's skates off!

07:18.208 --> 07:21.375
-Hockey scholarship, here we come!
-Dad, stop.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.125
It's just hockey camp.

07:23.292 --> 07:25.417
I mean, who knows what'll happen?

07:28.708 --> 07:30.708
Twenty-eight. Andersen, tripping.

07:31.375 --> 07:34.083
My penalty almost lost us the game today.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.167
What if I get to camp and I screw it up?

07:36.333 --> 07:37.667
Hey, don't talk like that.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.875
Yeah, you did great today, honey.

07:40.042 --> 07:41.958
Exactly. Mom gets it.

07:42.375 --> 07:43.792
Yeah, I guess…

07:43.958 --> 07:45.750
We're so proud of you.

07:45.917 --> 07:46.917
Night, monkey.

07:47.708 --> 07:49.083
All right, all right.

07:49.250 --> 07:50.708
Sleep tight, honey.

07:56.583 --> 07:58.875
Riley's so hard on herself.

07:59.042 --> 08:01.000
But we can make everything easier.

08:02.625 --> 08:06.625
Behold, my super high-tech
Riley protection system.

08:08.708 --> 08:09.875
Don't look, it's fine.

08:10.042 --> 08:13.792
This is for all those memories that belong
in the Back of the Mind…

08:13.958 --> 08:15.542
like this penalty one.

08:15.708 --> 08:18.375
It's weighing on her,
so let's lighten the load.

08:18.542 --> 08:20.333
A one-way expressway to…

08:20.500 --> 08:22.667
"We're not gonna think about that right now."

08:26.083 --> 08:27.083
-Not bad.
-Joy.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.375
-That's pretty impressive.
-You worked hard.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.708
You take such good care of Riley.

08:30.875 --> 08:31.958
Thanks, I try.

08:32.417 --> 08:33.792
Okay, let's do a sweep.

08:34.875 --> 08:38.542
Here's one where she waved at a guy
who was actually waving at a girl behind her.

08:39.042 --> 08:40.707
That was so bad. Good choice.

08:41.417 --> 08:43.292
Here's when she forgot that girl's name.

08:43.457 --> 08:44.458
Yeah, that was super awkward.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.667
-What was her name?
-I don't know, Janet or something?

08:46.833 --> 08:48.083
Whatever. Let's just get rid of it.

08:49.083 --> 08:52.667
We keep the best and toss the rest.

08:53.167 --> 08:54.333
Nice work, everyone.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.167
All right, Anger, the rest of these babies
can go to long-term.

09:04.667 --> 09:06.208
Okay. Let's get some shut-eye.

09:06.375 --> 09:07.833
Big day tomorrow.

09:14.625 --> 09:19.250
Joy, are you taking that
where I think you're taking that?

09:19.417 --> 09:21.417
-Wanna come this time?
-Yes.

09:21.708 --> 09:22.542
I mean no. I…

09:22.708 --> 09:25.167
Oh, no. I really shouldn't.

09:25.333 --> 09:28.208
You know, you're the only one
who hasn't been to the Belief System.

09:28.375 --> 09:31.708
Yeah, it's just that it's new,
and I know how important it is.

09:32.792 --> 09:34.917
And I don't wanna mess it up or break it…

09:35.083 --> 09:37.375
or burn it to the ground or anything.

09:37.542 --> 09:39.958
Sadness, you won't hurt it, I promise.

09:40.125 --> 09:41.583
Have I ever steered you wrong before?

09:41.750 --> 09:43.542
Yeah, many times.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.833
Come on.

09:46.167 --> 09:48.375
Where I go, you go.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.458
Oh, my goodness.

10:47.583 --> 10:49.625
Mom and Dad are proud of me.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.417
An oldie but a goodie.

10:53.750 --> 10:54.792
I'm kind.

10:56.125 --> 10:57.250
That's nice.

10:59.000 --> 11:00.458
I'm strong. I'm brave.

11:00.625 --> 11:02.000
I'm a really good friend.

11:19.833 --> 11:20.833
I'm a winner.

11:21.750 --> 11:26.500
And all those beliefs come together
to make our Riley.

11:26.667 --> 11:28.083
I'm a good person.

11:53.167 --> 11:55.750
What the heck is that?

12:16.542 --> 12:17.750
Turn that off, Joy!

12:17.917 --> 12:20.167
People, it's the apocalypse!

12:20.333 --> 12:21.333
No!

12:21.500 --> 12:22.708
What are you doing?

12:36.000 --> 12:37.542
Problem solved.

12:37.708 --> 12:38.542
Joy.

12:43.708 --> 12:45.667
Okay, let's clear it all out.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.750
It's demo day.

12:49.833 --> 12:50.833
Demo?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.333
Wait, wait, what's happening?

12:52.500 --> 12:54.250
What's going on?

12:57.333 --> 12:58.333
Who are you people?

13:02.500 --> 13:04.042
Hey, are you the one in charge here?

13:05.208 --> 13:07.833
Could you do me a favor
and stop tearing Headquarters apart?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.208
No can do. Didn't you hear?

13:09.375 --> 13:10.417
Permits just came through.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.042
Permits? For what?

13:12.208 --> 13:13.500
For expanding the place.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.125
You know, for the others.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.250
What others?

13:17.417 --> 13:18.417
They're not here yet?

13:19.625 --> 13:21.333
Hey, Margie, you got that console?

13:21.500 --> 13:23.208
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Give me a sec!

13:23.375 --> 13:24.250
Hey, hey! What are you doing?

13:24.417 --> 13:26.333
-All right. She's all set.
-Set with what?

13:26.500 --> 13:27.917
Come on, Riley. Get up.

13:28.083 --> 13:29.292
Camp time.

13:29.875 --> 13:31.333
Lunch break!

13:32.500 --> 13:34.208
Wait, wait! You can't leave it like this.

13:34.375 --> 13:35.750
Don't worry, we'll be back.

13:35.917 --> 13:37.000
Come on. We're gonna be late.

13:37.167 --> 13:38.875
-Oh, no, no, no!
-Let's go!

13:41.667 --> 13:43.875
Riley, you aren't packed yet?

13:45.917 --> 13:47.167
You're always on me!

13:47.333 --> 13:50.042
Can't you just lay off for,
like, one second?

13:50.667 --> 13:51.667
Overreact much?

13:51.833 --> 13:53.125
I barely touched it.

13:53.292 --> 13:55.167
Those morons broke the console.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.167
Riley, what's wrong?

13:57.833 --> 13:59.375
Mom looks sad.

13:59.542 --> 14:01.583
I'm the worst!

14:01.750 --> 14:03.333
Oh, no. Honey.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.833
I barely touched it.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.125
That's what I said.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.917
Let the professional handle this.

14:14.500 --> 14:18.833
I'm too gross to go to camp or anywhere
ever again!

14:19.333 --> 14:20.833
Oh, yeah, this is totally broken.

14:22.000 --> 14:24.042
Well, we all knew this day would come.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.667
Remember, we agreed not to make
a big deal about this.

14:26.833 --> 14:28.167
But she really does stink.

14:28.333 --> 14:29.208
It's bad.

14:29.375 --> 14:32.292
Remain calm.
Stick to the prepared script.

14:32.458 --> 14:34.708
You are not gross, honey.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.917
You're just changing.

14:37.083 --> 14:40.208
Remember that beautiful butterfly we saw
in the park last week?

14:40.375 --> 14:42.750
-Well, that butterfly began as a caterpillar.
-Easy…

14:42.917 --> 14:44.000
And just like that caterpillar…

14:44.167 --> 14:46.250
-Easy…
-…you're about to get your wings.

14:46.417 --> 14:48.208
-But if you have questions…
-Oh, my gosh, Mom!

14:48.375 --> 14:49.583
Just go away!

14:51.250 --> 14:54.125
Well, that's a preview of the next 10 years.

14:54.750 --> 14:56.000
-Riley!
-Oh, my gosh!

14:56.167 --> 14:57.583
-We're gonna have so much fun!
-All right.

14:57.750 --> 14:59.542
Who's ready for hockey camp?

14:59.708 --> 15:00.750
Yeah!

15:00.917 --> 15:02.292
Okay, until we can figure this out…

15:02.625 --> 15:05.292
nobody touch the console
unless you really need to.

15:06.917 --> 15:09.500
So, big weekend for us.
What do you wanna do?

15:09.667 --> 15:13.042
Well, we could finally clean out the garage.
Or, actually, we can get upstairs…

15:13.292 --> 15:15.292
How great is next year gonna be?

15:15.458 --> 15:18.792
Coach Roberts' team has been state champs
like every year.

15:19.167 --> 15:22.458
And Val Ortiz is the captain now.

15:22.625 --> 15:25.583
This Valentina Ortiz obsession
is outta control.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.250
She made the Fire Hawks
when she was only a freshman.

15:28.417 --> 15:30.125
That's really hard.

15:30.292 --> 15:32.292
All we have to do is be super awesome
at camp…

15:32.458 --> 15:36.292
Coach will put us on the team,
and we'll all be Fire Hawks!

15:37.125 --> 15:38.625
-Wait, what was that?
-What was what?

15:38.792 --> 15:40.667
We got a look. I don't like this.

15:40.833 --> 15:42.083
What? You're paranoid.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.333
I never miss a look.

15:46.542 --> 15:48.208
Enhance 224… 176.

15:48.375 --> 15:50.000
Track right. Zoom in.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.500
Right there!

15:52.667 --> 15:54.625
-So?
-She's hiding something.

15:54.792 --> 15:56.042
But what?

15:58.708 --> 15:59.708
What is she doing?

15:59.875 --> 16:01.042
She's looking at our look!

16:01.208 --> 16:03.917
No, it's much more than that.

16:06.542 --> 16:07.583
She looks the same to me.

16:07.750 --> 16:09.083
Overlay and compare.

16:09.250 --> 16:12.917
See? Riley then, Riley now.
Riley then, Riley now.

16:13.083 --> 16:14.500
It's so obvious!

16:14.667 --> 16:15.750
But what does it mean?

16:16.500 --> 16:18.542
She knows we're hiding something.

16:20.458 --> 16:21.625
What is happening right now?

16:21.792 --> 16:22.667
I don't know! I don't know!

16:22.833 --> 16:24.333
I can't take this anymore!

16:25.042 --> 16:26.625
You spilled the tea!

16:26.958 --> 16:28.625
Coach Roberts isn't gonna be our coach
next year.

16:28.792 --> 16:29.792
Grace!

16:33.167 --> 16:35.042
We got assigned to a different high school.

16:36.833 --> 16:38.417
Oh, no.

16:39.625 --> 16:40.625
Okay.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.500
Yeah. No big deal.

16:43.292 --> 16:44.667
-This is a huge deal!
-Our life is over!

16:44.833 --> 16:45.875
Is she serious right now?

16:46.042 --> 16:47.333
-How long have they known this?
-I can't breathe.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.500
We can't go to high school…

16:48.667 --> 16:50.500
-without Bree and Grace.
-We won't know anybody.

16:50.667 --> 16:51.875
We'll still get to hang out.

16:52.042 --> 16:53.583
And we'll have this weekend…

16:53.750 --> 16:56.625
which means we'll get one last time playing
on the same team.

16:56.792 --> 16:58.625
Friends are forever, right?

16:59.458 --> 17:01.583
Yeah. Of course.

17:02.792 --> 17:04.125
I can't wait to get to the rink.

17:04.291 --> 17:07.750
-When do we get our schedules?
-I heard our room has a view…

17:07.916 --> 17:09.666
This is so sad.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.333
No, wait, Sadness!

17:11.500 --> 17:12.875
-No, no, no! Don't!
-I don't have a good grip!

17:13.083 --> 17:14.916
Just keep it together
until we're out of the car.

17:16.166 --> 17:17.166
Here we are.

17:17.291 --> 17:19.833
This looks really cool.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.625
Are you sure you don't need
an assistant coach? 'Cause I am available.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.041
-Bill!
-No? All right.

17:24.208 --> 17:25.708
-We'll see you in a few days.
-Have fun!

17:25.875 --> 17:26.916
-Thanks so much. Bye!
-Don't miss us too much.

17:27.083 --> 17:28.792
-Okay, bye!
-Wait. Riley…

17:28.958 --> 17:30.250
are you sure you have everything?

17:30.417 --> 17:31.333
-Stick?
-Yes.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.375
-Gloves?
-Yes.

17:32.542 --> 17:33.750
-You have your phone?
-Yes, of course.

17:33.917 --> 17:35.417
-Fully charged?
-Yeah, it's like 50.

17:35.583 --> 17:36.583
-What?
-Dad, it's fine.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.292
Okay, call us if you need us.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.458
I love you. Go get 'em.

17:39.625 --> 17:40.667
Okay. Love you guys.

17:40.833 --> 17:42.958
-Don't forget the deodorant!
-Mom!

17:43.167 --> 17:44.167
Bye, monkey.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.833
Okay, now.

17:53.917 --> 17:56.208
It's okay. We need this.

18:01.958 --> 18:03.917
Guys, these are high-schoolers.

18:04.292 --> 18:06.083
We do not wanna be red and puffy, do we?

18:06.250 --> 18:07.083
No.

18:07.250 --> 18:10.667
Don't worry, we'll have plenty of time
to think about this after camp.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.958
Now, where did Bree and Grace go?

18:13.833 --> 18:14.833
-There they are.
-Wait.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.958
Aren't those traitors dead to us?

18:17.125 --> 18:18.833
Our best friends? No.

18:21.292 --> 18:22.167
Hey!

18:23.125 --> 18:24.125
Are you okay?

18:25.292 --> 18:27.417
Everybody act regular. It's Valentina Ortiz.

18:27.583 --> 18:28.625
We gotta say something.

18:30.042 --> 18:30.875
Hey.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.583
-Hi. I'm Val…
-I know. You're the varsity captain…

18:33.750 --> 18:35.375
you set the all-time goal record
as a junior…

18:35.542 --> 18:36.625
your favorite color's red,
and your skates…

18:36.792 --> 18:37.792
What are we saying?

18:37.958 --> 18:39.125
We are so uncool.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.083
Why are we still holding her hand?

18:41.250 --> 18:42.375
Just like me.

18:43.333 --> 18:44.833
You're the one Coach told us about.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.750
Riley, from Michigan, right?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.417
-It's Minnesota, sweetie.
-No, no, no.

18:48.583 --> 18:50.833
We cannot correct Val Ortiz.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.375
Yeah, that's me.

18:53.542 --> 18:55.958
Riley from good old Michigan.

18:56.833 --> 18:58.750
Orange? Who made the console orange?

18:58.917 --> 19:00.500
-Do I look orange?
-I didn't touch it.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.083
-Orange is not my color.
-Not me.

19:02.833 --> 19:04.333
Hello, everybody.

19:05.292 --> 19:07.667
Oh, my gosh. I am just such a huge fan
of yours.

19:07.833 --> 19:10.667
And now, here I am,
meeting you, face to face.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.625
Okay. How can I help?

19:13.083 --> 19:14.250
I can take notes, get coffee…

19:14.417 --> 19:15.500
manage your calendar, walk your dog…

19:15.667 --> 19:17.167
carry your things, watch you sleep.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.958
Wow! You have a lot of energy.

19:20.458 --> 19:21.958
Maybe you could just stay in one place.

19:22.125 --> 19:23.000
Anything.

19:23.167 --> 19:24.625
Just call my name, and I am here for you.

19:24.833 --> 19:25.833
Okay, love that.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.250
And what was your name again?

19:27.417 --> 19:28.875
I'm sorry. I can get ahead of myself.

19:29.042 --> 19:29.875
I'm Anxiety.

19:30.042 --> 19:31.333
I'm one of Riley's new emotions.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.625
And we are just super-jazzed to be here.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.000
Where can I put my stuff?

19:35.458 --> 19:36.958
What do you mean "we"?

19:37.667 --> 19:40.083
I wish I was as tall as all of you.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.542
Who the heck are you?

19:42.458 --> 19:43.625
I'm Envy.

19:44.625 --> 19:45.917
Look at your hair.

19:46.083 --> 19:47.250
Oh, yeah, not happening.

19:48.083 --> 19:49.375
Look at her hair!

19:49.542 --> 19:51.500
We need hair like that.

19:51.667 --> 19:54.125
Oh, my gosh. I love the red in your hair.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.958
What are you doing?

19:57.458 --> 20:00.917
Hey, maybe when I make the team,
I can join Team Redhead, too!

20:01.083 --> 20:01.917
Yeah, yeah.

20:05.625 --> 20:06.958
Okay, who's this guy?

20:07.125 --> 20:08.833
What's your name, big fella?

20:09.000 --> 20:10.125
That's Embarrassment.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.583
He's not really big on eye contact,
or like, good talking…

20:13.750 --> 20:15.042
but he's a really sweet guy.

20:15.208 --> 20:18.375
Well, welcome to Headquarters, Embarrassment.

20:18.542 --> 20:20.125
We're doing a… No.

20:20.292 --> 20:21.333
No, going high.

20:22.167 --> 20:24.167
You got a real sweaty palm there, buddy.

20:25.542 --> 20:27.167
Hey, do you wanna come with me, actually?

20:27.333 --> 20:28.583
You can meet some of the other Fire Hawks.

20:28.750 --> 20:29.750
This is exciting.

20:29.917 --> 20:32.042
But we can't let her know we're excited.

20:32.750 --> 20:34.083
Yeah, sounds good.

20:34.250 --> 20:35.583
What emotion was that?

20:35.750 --> 20:36.792
That's Ennui.

20:36.958 --> 20:38.083
An-what?

20:38.792 --> 20:40.000
Ennui.

20:40.167 --> 20:42.625
It's what you would call the boredom.

20:42.792 --> 20:45.375
Well, come on up here, An-wer.

20:45.542 --> 20:46.708
Am I saying it right?

20:46.875 --> 20:48.292
An-wah. No.

20:48.458 --> 20:50.292
Nicknames! I'm gonna call you Wee-Wee.

20:50.458 --> 20:51.625
No.

20:52.208 --> 20:53.542
How are you driving?

20:53.708 --> 20:55.000
Console app.

20:55.375 --> 20:57.125
Hey! Stop it! That's enough.

20:57.292 --> 20:59.167
Now, now, I know new emotions…

20:59.333 --> 21:02.042
can sometimes feel unhelpful at first…

21:02.208 --> 21:03.250
and you just wanna…

21:04.208 --> 21:06.208
say to them,
"Why are you so annoying?"

21:06.833 --> 21:11.125
But I've learned that every emotion
is good for Riley.

21:11.625 --> 21:12.750
Even this turkey.

21:13.417 --> 21:15.125
Okay, fine.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.583
Cool. Lead the way.

21:17.750 --> 21:19.750
All right. Grab your stuff and follow me.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.458
But what about our friends?

21:21.625 --> 21:23.292
Val is our future.

21:23.458 --> 21:24.792
Yes, I agree completely.

21:24.958 --> 21:28.167
We need new friends or else
we'll be totally alone in high school.

21:28.333 --> 21:29.333
-Right, Joy?
-Well…

21:29.500 --> 21:30.667
-I mean, maybe…
-Here we go!

21:30.833 --> 21:31.667
Wait up.

21:32.167 --> 21:33.708
Thanks for showing me around.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.000
Wait, why did you do that?

21:35.167 --> 21:36.458
Sorry. What did I do?

21:36.625 --> 21:38.292
We just left our best friends behind.

21:38.458 --> 21:40.250
But what about the new ones
that we're about to meet?

21:40.417 --> 21:41.250
No. Okay.

21:41.417 --> 21:44.292
These next three days need to be
about Bree and Grace.

21:44.458 --> 21:48.667
Joy, the next three days could determine
the next four years of our lives.

21:49.292 --> 21:51.667
Now, I think that's overstating things a bit.

21:52.208 --> 21:54.000
Joy is so old school.

21:54.167 --> 21:55.000
What?

21:55.167 --> 21:56.583
Look, we all have a job to do.

21:56.750 --> 21:57.917
You make Riley happy…

21:58.083 --> 21:58.917
Sadness makes her sad…

21:59.083 --> 22:01.333
Fear protects her from the scary stuff
she can see…

22:01.500 --> 22:04.792
and my job is to protect her
from the scary stuff she can't see.

22:04.958 --> 22:06.833
I plan for the future.

22:07.167 --> 22:08.792
I can show you.
You're gonna love this.

22:11.958 --> 22:13.417
I was using that as a cup holder.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.708
Okay, so my team has run all the data…

22:15.875 --> 22:18.167
and we're looking at the following
likely scenarios.

22:18.333 --> 22:21.417
First, we don't take this camp seriously,
and we goof off with Bree and Grace.

22:21.583 --> 22:23.917
Riley looks really uncool in front of Val.

22:24.083 --> 22:26.500
She fails to impress the coach,
does not become a Fire Hawk…

22:26.667 --> 22:28.292
and finally arrives at high school.

22:28.458 --> 22:29.708
She has no one.

22:29.875 --> 22:33.000
She eats alone,
and only the teachers know her name.

22:33.250 --> 22:34.667
Okay, you and I are gonna be friends.

22:35.042 --> 22:37.042
This is a sad story.

22:37.208 --> 22:39.000
It's a ridiculous story.

22:39.167 --> 22:41.708
Look, again, love the energy,
but you're being silly.

22:41.875 --> 22:43.417
None of this will actually happen.

22:43.583 --> 22:44.750
Right. Whatever you say.

22:44.917 --> 22:46.000
You're the boss.

22:46.417 --> 22:50.042
Remember when we all finally came up
to Headquarters?

22:50.208 --> 22:52.833
That was like 30 seconds ago, Nostalgia.

22:53.000 --> 22:55.000
Yeah, those were the days.

22:55.167 --> 22:57.625
Nostalgia, you aren't supposed
to be here yet.

22:57.792 --> 23:00.125
You still have about 10 years,
two graduations…

23:00.292 --> 23:01.750
and a best friend's wedding
before you're invited…

23:01.917 --> 23:03.500
but I will keep you in the loop, I promise.

23:03.667 --> 23:05.875
-All right, you ready, Riley?
-Hey, hey, everybody focus!

23:06.042 --> 23:08.250
Val is leading us
into their holy inner sanctum!

23:08.417 --> 23:09.750
And here we are!

23:12.667 --> 23:15.458
These girls are so cool!

23:15.625 --> 23:16.583
And older.

23:16.750 --> 23:17.958
We are not changing in front of them.

23:18.125 --> 23:19.167
It's fine!

23:19.333 --> 23:20.917
Locker rooms are places
of mutual respect.

23:21.083 --> 23:23.417
Hey, come on! I want you to meet
the other Fire Hawks.

23:23.583 --> 23:24.500
-Hey, girl!
-What's up?

23:24.917 --> 23:25.792
Hey.

23:25.958 --> 23:27.417
Riley is from Michigan.

23:27.583 --> 23:29.583
Okay, we're stuck with that.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.542
Cool. Where in Michigan are you from?

23:32.250 --> 23:33.250
Oh, no. What now?

23:33.417 --> 23:35.250
Okay, looks like we're committing to this.

23:35.417 --> 23:36.542
Cities in Michigan…

23:36.708 --> 23:37.750
We need to make something up.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.125
I'm from all over.

23:40.292 --> 23:41.792
Nice. See you out there.

23:42.167 --> 23:43.292
Hey, you wanna sit with us?

23:43.708 --> 23:44.917
She wants to sit with us.

23:45.875 --> 23:47.417
Everything is beautiful!

23:47.583 --> 23:49.583
There's not enough room for Bree and Grace.

23:50.042 --> 23:51.292
Let's go sit over there.

23:51.458 --> 23:53.250
I was gonna go save seats
for my friends.

23:53.417 --> 23:54.792
But thanks anyway.

23:55.792 --> 23:56.833
Yeah. Okay.

23:57.000 --> 23:57.833
No worries.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.708
See? Was that so hard?

23:59.875 --> 24:00.833
No. You're totally right.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.833
That decision's not gonna haunt us
for the rest of our lives at all.

24:04.250 --> 24:06.458
-No way!
-Bree and Grace!

24:06.625 --> 24:07.917
-There you are.
-Riley.

24:08.083 --> 24:10.792
Time to celebrate!

24:10.958 --> 24:11.958
Say…

24:13.250 --> 24:15.667
Okay, ladies. Let's all settle in.

24:19.583 --> 24:20.583
Joy?

24:20.750 --> 24:22.292
-Wait, wait, wait.
-Ladies!

24:22.458 --> 24:24.500
Settle in means settle down.

24:25.042 --> 24:26.083
I need your focus.

24:26.250 --> 24:28.542
Which means now I'm going to need
your cell phones.

24:28.708 --> 24:29.583
All of 'em.

24:32.667 --> 24:36.167
You're here to work, not goof around.

24:36.333 --> 24:37.375
Got that, Andersen?

24:39.083 --> 24:40.083
Yes, Coach.

24:40.250 --> 24:42.333
Please put all your phones in the basket.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.250
You get them back at the end of camp.

24:46.500 --> 24:49.625
Wow. Coach is so serious.

24:49.792 --> 24:51.958
Joy, I'm just curious.
Maybe I could help…

24:52.125 --> 24:53.125
Thank you. Not now.

24:53.292 --> 24:54.458
I know, right?

24:57.250 --> 24:58.500
You think this is funny?

24:59.083 --> 25:00.292
Well, you know what else is funny?

25:00.458 --> 25:01.500
Skating lines.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.125
Now hit the ice, ladies.

25:03.417 --> 25:05.292
-Great job, Michigan.
-Thanks a lot, new girl.

25:05.458 --> 25:06.667
Just make her do it.

25:07.958 --> 25:10.542
Bravo, Joy. She's totally fitting in now.

25:10.708 --> 25:12.542
Thanks so much, Wee-Wee.

25:16.417 --> 25:18.125
You're lagging behind, Andersen!

25:18.292 --> 25:20.208
-Skate harder!
-This is the worst.

25:21.375 --> 25:23.458
All right, ladies, take a breather.

25:23.625 --> 25:25.417
Then we'll divide into teams.

25:31.917 --> 25:34.000
That Michigan girl is off to a rough start.

25:34.167 --> 25:35.000
Oh, no.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.375
Are they talking about us?

25:36.542 --> 25:39.708
Yeah, there's no way Coach is putting her
on the team if she can't get it together.

25:39.875 --> 25:43.000
Okay, Dani, like you had it all
together when you were a freshman?

25:43.167 --> 25:44.417
I wasn't that immature.

25:44.583 --> 25:48.750
Dani, you stuck straws up your nose.
Like last night.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.667
I got you, big guy.

25:57.458 --> 26:00.958
I always wanted people to talk about us,
but not like this.

26:01.125 --> 26:03.083
Joy, what do we do now?

26:04.375 --> 26:05.500
We can just…

26:05.667 --> 26:06.917
I have an idea.

26:07.083 --> 26:07.917
Okay.

26:08.083 --> 26:11.833
If we can get Val on our side,
everything will be great.

26:16.625 --> 26:17.625
Val?

26:17.792 --> 26:19.000
Hey, Riley. What's up?

26:22.000 --> 26:23.375
I'm so sorry.

26:23.542 --> 26:25.458
I didn't mean to get the whole team
skating lines.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.667
I feel terrible.

26:26.833 --> 26:28.000
I respect you so much.

26:28.167 --> 26:29.500
I would never do anything to mess you up.

26:29.667 --> 26:31.000
That's laying it on a bit thick,
don't you think?

26:31.167 --> 26:32.167
-Joy.
-You're a great hockey player…

26:32.333 --> 26:33.833
and you lead the team so amazingly…

26:34.000 --> 26:35.792
-and I really look up to you and…
-Okay, okay.

26:35.958 --> 26:36.958
Thanks.

26:37.125 --> 26:39.583
Listen, Coach was pretty hard on you today…

26:39.750 --> 26:41.208
but that's not a bad thing.

26:41.375 --> 26:42.708
It means you're on her radar.

26:42.875 --> 26:43.750
Really?

26:43.917 --> 26:45.708
Listen, I'm glad you came to talk with me.

26:45.875 --> 26:47.875
Hey, let's try to be on the same team later,
okay?

26:48.042 --> 26:49.458
Yeah. Cool.

26:49.625 --> 26:50.542
Wow.

26:50.708 --> 26:52.250
-Good job. Wow.
-I wish I could do that.

26:52.417 --> 26:54.583
You guys, I mean, it really wasn't anything.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.167
I'm just trying to help.

26:56.333 --> 26:57.708
I agree.

26:57.875 --> 27:00.000
Great job, Anxiety.

27:00.167 --> 27:02.125
I stepped back, you stepped in…

27:02.292 --> 27:05.000
you got Riley back on track,
now I'm ready to step back in.

27:05.167 --> 27:06.792
But that was just part one of my plan.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.042
There's a part two?

27:08.208 --> 27:10.667
A good plan has many parts, Joy.

27:10.833 --> 27:13.583
Okay, ladies, we're gonna form your teams
for the rest of camp.

27:13.750 --> 27:15.042
Now, split yourselves down the middle.

27:15.208 --> 27:18.208
Team one on the right, team two on the left.

27:18.375 --> 27:19.292
Let's do this!

27:19.458 --> 27:20.750
One more time on the same team, right?

27:20.917 --> 27:21.917
Right.

27:23.875 --> 27:25.125
Val wants us.

27:25.292 --> 27:26.833
But we promised Bree and Grace.

27:27.000 --> 27:28.792
Joy, we have to plan for the future.

27:31.625 --> 27:33.333
Come on, Riley, move. Move those feet!

27:33.500 --> 27:34.667
Val's on team one, you wanna be on team one.

27:34.833 --> 27:35.750
Let's go.

27:35.917 --> 27:37.500
She made a promise to her friends.

27:37.667 --> 27:39.333
She's not gonna break it.

27:39.500 --> 27:40.833
You're so right, Joy.

27:42.667 --> 27:43.708
-What are you doing?
-Hey!

27:44.875 --> 27:47.292
No! You can't have that.
Put that back.

27:50.375 --> 27:51.708
-Joy, I don't mean to overstep…
-No!

27:51.875 --> 27:54.083
-…but it has to be done.
-What are you… No!

28:03.125 --> 28:04.125
No…

28:04.417 --> 28:06.750
I know change is scary, but watch.

28:08.875 --> 28:10.875
I'm so excited.

28:12.667 --> 28:14.625
All right.
Welcome to our team, Michigan.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.750
That is not Riley.

28:22.917 --> 28:24.250
I know. It's a better Riley.

28:24.417 --> 28:26.708
A Riley who won't be alone next year.

28:26.875 --> 28:28.625
We build her a new Sense of Self.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.792
A brand-new her.

28:31.458 --> 28:32.292
No, no, no!

28:32.458 --> 28:33.625
You can't go down there with that.

28:33.792 --> 28:35.917
Over my dead flaming body!

28:37.625 --> 28:39.125
I am truly sorry.

28:39.292 --> 28:41.458
I was so looking forward
to working with you guys.

28:42.042 --> 28:44.375
-Hey, hey! What do you think you're doing?
-Get off me!

28:44.542 --> 28:45.792
Riley's life is more complex now.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.625
It requires more sophisticated emotions
than all of you.

28:48.792 --> 28:51.208
You just aren't what she needs anymore, Joy.

28:52.292 --> 28:53.792
How dare you, madam!

28:53.958 --> 28:55.750
You can't just bottle us up!

28:56.333 --> 28:57.458
That's a great idea.

28:58.875 --> 29:00.542
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!

29:00.708 --> 29:02.875
It's not forever.
It's just until Riley makes varsity…

29:03.042 --> 29:04.875
or until she turns 18, or maybe forever.

29:05.042 --> 29:06.042
I don't know. We'll have to see.

29:06.208 --> 29:07.417
-Bye!
-Anxiety!

29:07.583 --> 29:09.083
Riley needs us!

29:10.125 --> 29:10.958
Okay.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.958
Don't worry, Riley. You're in good hands.

29:13.125 --> 29:15.292
Now let's change everything about you.

29:25.333 --> 29:27.875
Quick question. How do we
build a new Riley…

29:28.042 --> 29:30.083
which I'm loving, by the way,
amazing concept…

29:30.250 --> 29:33.542
if it took them 13 years
to build the old one?

29:33.708 --> 29:35.750
Well, good news is
we're not starting from scratch.

29:36.958 --> 29:38.042
I wanna plant one.

29:38.208 --> 29:39.208
Next time.

29:46.292 --> 29:49.167
If I'm a Fire Hawk, I won't be alone.

29:58.250 --> 29:59.583
No, no, no!

30:00.458 --> 30:01.500
Let us out now!

30:01.667 --> 30:03.583
No, stop! Stop! Let us out!

30:03.750 --> 30:05.750
Joy…

30:13.458 --> 30:16.875
We're gonna be in here forever.

30:21.917 --> 30:22.958
Where are you putting us?

30:23.125 --> 30:25.000
The same place we keep
all of Riley's secrets.

30:25.167 --> 30:26.208
We're not secrets.

30:26.375 --> 30:27.792
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
"We're not secrets.

30:27.958 --> 30:29.500
"We're making a big mistake."

30:29.667 --> 30:31.000
Never heard that before.

30:34.958 --> 30:37.833
We are suppressed emotions!

30:38.208 --> 30:39.917
Let us out! Right now!

30:40.083 --> 30:41.875
No, no, no. Riley's gonna be fine.

30:42.042 --> 30:43.208
Totally fine.

30:43.375 --> 30:45.917
Hey, there. You know what we call that?

30:46.083 --> 30:47.125
Denial.

30:47.292 --> 30:48.750
Can you say denial?

30:49.583 --> 30:50.667
Hi, friends.

30:51.000 --> 30:54.708
Welcome. It's so good to have you here
with us today.

30:55.333 --> 30:56.792
It's Bloofy!

30:56.958 --> 30:58.875
From that preschool show Riley used to like?

30:59.042 --> 31:00.167
That's right!

31:00.333 --> 31:02.083
And here's a little secret.

31:03.792 --> 31:06.167
Riley still likes the show.

31:06.750 --> 31:08.958
Stomp like an elephant
Scurry like a mouse

31:09.125 --> 31:11.667
Make your way down to Bloofy's house!

31:11.833 --> 31:12.917
Please kill me.

31:13.083 --> 31:15.125
Bloofy, we're in a real pickle.

31:15.292 --> 31:16.917
Could you help us get out of here?

31:17.917 --> 31:19.833
We're gonna need your help.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.792
Can you find a way out?

31:22.875 --> 31:24.208
Who are you talking to?

31:24.375 --> 31:25.250
My friends.

31:25.833 --> 31:27.542
Do you see a key?

31:30.250 --> 31:31.708
I don't either.

31:31.875 --> 31:32.917
Okay, we're doomed.

31:33.083 --> 31:33.958
Indeed.

31:34.417 --> 31:37.500
Welcome to your eternal fate.

31:38.125 --> 31:39.625
Lance Slashblade?

31:39.792 --> 31:41.708
But he's a video game character.

31:41.875 --> 31:42.917
Why is he here?

31:43.083 --> 31:45.500
Yeah, I always thought Riley
had a secret crush on him.

31:45.667 --> 31:47.208
I never saw the appeal.

31:47.375 --> 31:49.417
I long to be a hero…

31:49.583 --> 31:52.083
but darkness haunts my past.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.542
-I get it.
-I'm in a hundred percent.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.125
Who's that?

31:58.292 --> 32:00.875
That's Riley's Deep Dark Secret.

32:01.042 --> 32:02.833
What is the secret?

32:03.833 --> 32:04.917
You don't wanna know.

32:05.083 --> 32:08.833
Riley's secrets, a rogue emotion
has taken over Headquarters.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.792
Now, if you could just open the jar…

32:10.958 --> 32:12.833
Hey, kids, let's learn some Latin.

32:13.000 --> 32:14.750
Do you know quid pro quo?

32:14.917 --> 32:18.125
We get you out of that jar,
then you get us out of this safe.

32:18.292 --> 32:19.292
No, Bloofy.

32:19.458 --> 32:21.958
Their destiny is not ours to change.

32:22.125 --> 32:23.667
We were all banished here…

32:23.833 --> 32:26.292
deemed unfit, worthless.

32:27.000 --> 32:28.375
Don't you dare say that.

32:28.542 --> 32:30.792
You do not deserve to be thrown away.

32:30.958 --> 32:31.958
One second, Lance.

32:32.125 --> 32:34.375
Don't you remember his power move?

32:34.542 --> 32:35.958
I'm coming for you, Riley!

32:36.125 --> 32:38.042
Oh, yeah? Watch this!

32:39.583 --> 32:40.792
Come on!

32:40.958 --> 32:42.542
You listen to me, Lance Slashblade.

32:43.125 --> 32:44.708
No one is totally worthless.

32:44.875 --> 32:48.000
But I am a warrior cursed
with a feeble attack.

32:48.167 --> 32:51.417
Then you must make your curse your gift.

32:52.708 --> 32:54.500
Shield yourself, my friends…

32:54.667 --> 32:57.083
for I shall set you all free!

33:01.958 --> 33:02.958
Hey, little help?

33:06.625 --> 33:07.958
Great job, Dark Secret.

33:09.042 --> 33:10.958
Now it's your turn to help us.

33:11.125 --> 33:13.708
My pouch has just the thing
to get us out of here.

33:13.875 --> 33:17.542
Everybody say, "Oh, Pouchy!"

33:18.333 --> 33:20.583
Oh, Pouchy!

33:22.958 --> 33:25.417
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy.

33:25.583 --> 33:27.208
Pouchy, we need to escape.

33:27.375 --> 33:29.042
Do you have anything that can help us?

33:29.208 --> 33:30.667
I have lots of items.

33:31.042 --> 33:33.083
Which one do you think will work the best?

33:33.250 --> 33:34.458
A tomato…

33:34.625 --> 33:35.792
a frog…

33:35.958 --> 33:38.000
or exploding dynamite?

33:38.167 --> 33:39.583
Oh, for crying out loud.

33:41.833 --> 33:43.917
Yay! We did it, everyone!

33:44.083 --> 33:46.667
Let's all sing the "We did it" song.

33:46.833 --> 33:47.708
No time!

33:48.458 --> 33:49.750
Thank you, friends.

33:50.750 --> 33:52.958
I must be leaving you.

33:53.125 --> 33:55.417
What about Dark Secret?

33:56.542 --> 33:58.708
Not yet.

33:59.917 --> 34:01.750
Yeah, that's probably best for everybody.

34:01.917 --> 34:04.083
Hey! Who let you out? Get back in there!

34:04.250 --> 34:05.708
-Oh, boy.
-What are we gonna do?

34:05.875 --> 34:06.917
Oh disgusted one…

34:07.625 --> 34:11.833
as you once believed in me,
I will now believe in myself.

34:17.292 --> 34:18.708
Wait. What?

34:27.917 --> 34:29.625
What's happening?

34:33.917 --> 34:34.917
No…

34:35.083 --> 34:36.083
Dave, help! Help!

34:36.250 --> 34:37.250
Hold on!

34:37.750 --> 34:38.750
Dave!

34:40.708 --> 34:41.958
Lance!

34:42.125 --> 34:43.125
Goodbye, friends.

34:43.292 --> 34:44.917
Hello, destiny!

34:45.667 --> 34:47.000
Well, there's a lid for every pot.

34:47.167 --> 34:48.167
Come on!

34:50.083 --> 34:51.375
What do we do? What do we do?

34:51.542 --> 34:53.333
Whoa, Anger, stop.
Where are you going?

34:53.500 --> 34:56.083
Back to Headquarters…
to help Riley!

34:56.250 --> 34:57.583
Riley's not up there.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.208
She's out there.

34:59.375 --> 35:02.083
We can't go back
without her Sense of Self.

35:02.250 --> 35:05.417
You want us to go all the way
to the Back of the Mind?

35:05.583 --> 35:07.500
Are you out of your mind?

35:07.667 --> 35:08.917
But, Joy, how will we…

35:09.083 --> 35:10.083
-Freeze!
-Come on!

35:10.250 --> 35:11.250
Hold it right there!

35:13.333 --> 35:15.917
How do we get there?
Do you even have a plan, Joy?

35:16.083 --> 35:18.625
I bet Anxiety would have
a really good plan…

35:18.792 --> 35:20.583
Of course I have a plan.
Who doesn't have a plan?

35:20.750 --> 35:23.042
Look, she's not the only one
who can project the future.

35:23.208 --> 35:25.292
First, all we have to do is…

35:26.583 --> 35:27.583
Give me a second.

35:28.500 --> 35:30.583
Follow the stream of consciousness…

35:30.750 --> 35:33.625
and then we take a nice, easy float
all the way to the Back of the Mind.

35:33.792 --> 35:35.583
-Where all the bad memories are.
-Exactly.

35:35.750 --> 35:38.500
And there, we'll find the Riley
we know and love.

35:39.083 --> 35:42.750
We'll put her Sense of Self back,
and then Riley will be Riley again.

35:42.917 --> 35:45.042
Okay, I'm gonna give it to you.
That could actually work.

35:45.208 --> 35:46.208
Yeah, it could!

35:46.375 --> 35:50.417
And then I tell Anxiety,
"Hey, don't worry so much anymore."

35:50.583 --> 35:54.292
And she'll say, "Wow, Joy, I never thought
of that before. Thank you."

35:54.458 --> 35:55.667
And then we hug and become best friends…

35:55.833 --> 35:57.583
And then I punt her into the dump.

35:58.417 --> 35:59.417
What? No, Anger.

35:59.583 --> 36:01.500
Okay, fine. No punting.

36:02.917 --> 36:04.917
Don't worry,
I know right where the stream is.

36:05.083 --> 36:06.708
Sadness and I have been here before.

36:07.958 --> 36:09.542
Joy, this is a dead end.

36:09.708 --> 36:12.000
Those are the worst kinds of ends!

36:12.167 --> 36:15.542
Everything's changing so fast!

36:15.708 --> 36:16.875
So, we're lost.

36:17.042 --> 36:19.500
No. You're never lost if you're having fun.

36:19.667 --> 36:20.792
No one is having fun, Joy.

36:20.958 --> 36:22.500
Oh, come on! Look at Sadness.

36:22.667 --> 36:24.333
She's having a great time.

36:25.625 --> 36:27.125
I thought you knew where you were going.

36:27.292 --> 36:28.292
I do. I did.

36:28.458 --> 36:29.917
-I just need a moment.
-She doesn't know.

36:30.083 --> 36:31.375
We're stuck here!

36:32.708 --> 36:34.125
Riley's awake.

36:34.292 --> 36:36.542
Wait, she's up too early.
What are they doing to her?

36:36.833 --> 36:38.583
Come on, we'll find another way.

36:40.125 --> 36:42.250
Don't worry, Riley.
We're coming.

36:49.333 --> 36:51.458
Why are we up so early?

36:51.625 --> 36:53.875
Because, mon ami,
we need to speed things up…

36:54.042 --> 36:55.375
and that means we hit the ice early…

36:55.542 --> 36:58.167
and practice
like we've never practiced before.

36:58.333 --> 36:59.875
Aren't we already good at hockey?

37:00.042 --> 37:00.875
We're good.

37:01.042 --> 37:02.583
But the Fire Hawks are great.

37:02.750 --> 37:03.583
That's right!

37:07.333 --> 37:09.583
Every time we miss,
we skate a lap around the rink.

37:09.750 --> 37:11.708
Hockey is not a game, it is a sport.

37:23.250 --> 37:24.583
-Yes!
-Wow.

37:24.917 --> 37:26.083
That was amazing.

37:26.250 --> 37:29.333
We need to be that good every time.
Let's run it again.

37:29.500 --> 37:31.583
Hey, I see I'm not the only one
who likes to start early.

37:31.750 --> 37:32.667
You guys, it's Val!

37:32.875 --> 37:34.042
We had the same idea.

37:34.208 --> 37:36.917
We're basically the same person.
We're gonna be best friends.

37:37.083 --> 37:38.458
How long have you been here?

37:38.625 --> 37:40.417
I don't know. Maybe an hour.

37:40.583 --> 37:42.833
I just wanted to get in some extra ice time.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.042
I'm the same way.

37:44.208 --> 37:45.875
Oh, my gosh. She gets us.

37:46.042 --> 37:48.042
See? I told the other girls
you'd figure it out.

37:48.208 --> 37:50.292
You get what it takes to be the best.

37:52.667 --> 37:53.750
Look at us.

37:53.917 --> 37:55.583
This is going great!

37:55.750 --> 37:58.250
Yeah! But we need Val
to really like us.

37:58.625 --> 38:00.375
We should ask Val lots of questions.

38:00.542 --> 38:02.250
People love talking about themselves.

38:02.417 --> 38:05.417
So, what was your freshman year
on the Fire Hawks like?

38:05.583 --> 38:08.167
I mean, it was a lot of work…

38:08.333 --> 38:09.792
like, a lot…

38:09.958 --> 38:12.000
but it's also how I met my best friends.

38:12.167 --> 38:14.167
Val is sharing things with us!

38:14.333 --> 38:16.417
Hey, a few of us are just gonna
hang out tonight…

38:16.583 --> 38:18.583
order some food.
You should come.

38:18.750 --> 38:20.833
An exclusive invitation.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.000
We're going!

38:22.458 --> 38:23.625
-Really?
-Definitely.

38:23.792 --> 38:24.792
It'll be fun.

38:24.958 --> 38:26.667
All right, ladies, let's warm up.

38:28.333 --> 38:29.333
Hey, Riley.

38:29.500 --> 38:30.333
Hi.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.583
We are not sharing Val with them.

38:32.750 --> 38:34.500
Early mornings make me so hungry.

38:34.667 --> 38:35.750
I know, right?

38:36.042 --> 38:38.375
I'd give anything for a piece
of pizza right now.

38:38.542 --> 38:39.375
Yes!

38:39.542 --> 38:41.292
See? I told you I'd find it.

38:41.458 --> 38:42.833
The Stream of Consciousness.

38:43.000 --> 38:45.583
-But, Joy…
-Wow! Our girl is hungry.

38:45.792 --> 38:46.917
Hop on something delicious!

38:47.083 --> 38:48.417
-Joy…
-Deep dish.

38:48.917 --> 38:50.167
And it's still warm.

38:50.333 --> 38:51.708
Extra cheese, baby!

38:51.875 --> 38:52.750
Sadness, come on.

38:52.917 --> 38:54.292
But I've been trying to tell you.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.500
We can't take the tube back, Joy.

38:56.833 --> 38:59.375
Someone has to be at the console
to recall us.

38:59.542 --> 39:01.500
She's right. We'd be stranded.

39:01.667 --> 39:03.000
Yeah. Anxiety would have thought about that.

39:03.167 --> 39:04.458
Well, I doubt it. Fine.

39:04.625 --> 39:05.625
Okay…

39:06.375 --> 39:09.125
So, someone's
gonna have to crawl up that tube…

39:09.292 --> 39:10.542
and go back to Headquarters…

39:10.708 --> 39:12.542
and at the right moment, bring us back.

39:12.708 --> 39:14.083
I'll do it. I'll pound that…

39:14.250 --> 39:15.333
I don't think so, punty.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.208
-Okay, here's the thing.
-You were never an option.

39:17.375 --> 39:18.208
Thank you.

39:18.375 --> 39:20.500
You want me to crawl through a tube in this?

39:20.667 --> 39:21.958
Yeah, not happening.

39:24.750 --> 39:27.583
Oh, no, not me.

39:27.750 --> 39:29.458
Yes! Sadness, you could do it.

39:29.625 --> 39:31.750
You know the console better than anybody.

39:31.917 --> 39:33.792
You've read the manuals cover to cover.

39:33.958 --> 39:35.375
I mean, you say that…

39:35.542 --> 39:38.833
but I know a lot less
about Manual 28, Chapter Seven…

39:39.000 --> 39:42.375
"How to Recall Non-Memory Objects"
than most folks realize.

39:42.542 --> 39:44.042
You've proven my point for me, Sadness.

39:44.208 --> 39:45.250
That sounds like a yes.

39:45.417 --> 39:47.417
Where is everybody? You on break again?

39:47.875 --> 39:49.708
Walkie-talkies. Here. Check-check-check.

39:49.875 --> 39:51.000
Can you hear me? I gotta press a button.

39:51.167 --> 39:53.417
Go for Joy. Copy that. Over. I love 'em!

39:53.667 --> 39:54.833
We'll signal you
when we get there…

39:55.000 --> 39:56.208
and then you bring us back.

39:57.042 --> 39:59.000
Sadness, it's the fastest way
back to Headquarters.

39:59.167 --> 40:00.167
Joy, I can't do it.

40:00.333 --> 40:02.583
I'm not strong like you are.

40:02.750 --> 40:04.125
I know you, Sadness.

40:04.292 --> 40:05.833
You are strong.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.667
I can't give you
specific examples right now…

40:08.833 --> 40:10.208
but you got this.

40:12.667 --> 40:14.542
Just don't look down and keep moving.

40:14.708 --> 40:16.292
Yeah, I can do it.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.042
She'll be okay. Right?

40:21.542 --> 40:22.542
Fifty-fifty.

40:23.792 --> 40:24.792
You want one?

40:25.917 --> 40:27.000
But we hate those things.

40:27.167 --> 40:28.958
They taste like cardboard.

40:29.750 --> 40:31.167
We can't say no to Val.

40:31.333 --> 40:33.125
Okay, no, you're so right.

40:33.292 --> 40:34.625
We eat whatever Val eats.

40:34.792 --> 40:35.792
That's the spirit!

40:36.375 --> 40:38.542
Envy, I think you're really in the zone.

40:38.708 --> 40:40.000
Take the wheel, I'll be right back.

40:40.167 --> 40:41.833
She picked me! She picked me.
Did you see that, Ennui?

40:42.000 --> 40:44.750
-She picked me.
-You care too much about things.

40:47.458 --> 40:50.083
It's got a very interesting texture.

40:50.250 --> 40:51.292
It tastes like…

40:52.750 --> 40:54.042
What does it remind me of?

40:55.792 --> 40:59.292
Cardboard? Asparagus? Broccoli?

40:59.458 --> 41:00.875
What are they doing to her up there?

41:01.042 --> 41:02.542
I don't know, but we have to go.

41:02.708 --> 41:03.750
No! No way am I step…

41:03.917 --> 41:05.792
We have to. Riley needs us.

41:06.583 --> 41:07.708
Okay, fine!

41:11.125 --> 41:13.417
Gross. I think I'm gonna be sick.

41:26.667 --> 41:29.250
If I'm good at hockey, I'll have friends.

41:39.500 --> 41:40.500
Okay, Miss Riley.

41:40.667 --> 41:41.875
-Way to go, Michigan.
-Nice one, Michigan.

41:42.042 --> 41:44.042
All right, ladies. Great day today.

41:44.208 --> 41:45.667
Take it easy tonight.

41:45.833 --> 41:48.292
Yes! This is the moment
we've been waiting for.

41:48.458 --> 41:51.000
Party time with Val and our future besties!

41:52.167 --> 41:53.667
Why are we stopping?
What's going on?

41:53.833 --> 41:55.417
There it is.

41:55.583 --> 41:57.250
The red notebook.

41:57.417 --> 41:59.625
Don't say it like that. You'll freak her out.

41:59.792 --> 42:01.000
Why would it freak me out?

42:01.167 --> 42:03.833
Only because everything
Coach thinks about you is in there.

42:04.000 --> 42:05.750
The good and the bad.

42:05.917 --> 42:08.417
-Whether she wants you on the team…
-Or not.

42:08.583 --> 42:09.667
You guys, too much.

42:09.833 --> 42:12.542
-What? It's the truth.
-She's not wrong.

42:12.708 --> 42:14.417
What do you think she's written about us?

42:14.583 --> 42:16.292
I don't know. Do you think it's bad?

42:16.458 --> 42:18.542
Well, I didn't until now!

42:18.708 --> 42:21.167
What if she's made a list of all
her favorite players, and we're not on it?

42:21.333 --> 42:23.792
Or a list of all the worst players,
and we're at the top?

42:23.958 --> 42:25.583
Or worse, we're not on either list…

42:25.750 --> 42:27.958
and we fade into obscurity!

42:28.125 --> 42:30.583
Sorry to interrupt you,
but they're walking away.

42:31.167 --> 42:32.708
We're losing them, we're losing them.

42:34.583 --> 42:38.583
Okay. First big hang with the group.
We just gotta act casual.

42:39.167 --> 42:41.000
Why do our arms swing like that when we walk?

42:41.167 --> 42:42.417
Try to keep them still.

42:42.917 --> 42:44.583
-That looks crazy.
-Okay.

42:44.750 --> 42:47.083
Well, walk like Dani.
Her arms have rhythm.

42:47.917 --> 42:49.375
No, you're making it worse!

42:49.583 --> 42:52.500
Well, that wasn't my intention.
I'm sorry for trying something!

42:52.667 --> 42:54.750
What do you think pockets are for?

42:54.917 --> 42:57.125
-That's good.
-Ennui, I am very proud of you.

42:58.625 --> 42:59.667
What are they laughing about?

42:59.833 --> 43:01.500
Does anybody know
what cool people laugh about?

43:01.667 --> 43:03.083
I don't know. We were too focused
on the arms thing.

43:03.250 --> 43:04.833
Just pretend we get the joke.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.708
Joy, Anger is taking up the floret.

43:14.875 --> 43:16.292
Fear, what is the matter with you?

43:16.458 --> 43:17.500
I don't like this vessel.

43:17.667 --> 43:18.667
Well, that's all we have.

43:18.833 --> 43:20.167
How much longer till we get there?

43:20.333 --> 43:21.417
We'll get there when we get there.

43:21.583 --> 43:23.875
I bet Anxiety would know how long,
down to the minute.

43:24.042 --> 43:25.833
Well, she just knows everything, doesn't she?

43:26.000 --> 43:27.042
Look, I don't like her words…

43:27.208 --> 43:28.333
and I do not like her actions.

43:28.500 --> 43:29.750
I just think I can change her.

43:29.917 --> 43:32.250
You know what?
Who likes banana bread?

43:32.417 --> 43:33.583
Show of hands.

43:37.125 --> 43:39.542
So, Michigan, who's your favorite band?

43:41.250 --> 43:42.292
Everyone's staring at us.

43:42.458 --> 43:44.375
There's only one right answer
to this question.

43:45.625 --> 43:47.667
Get Up and Glow! They're so awesome.

43:47.917 --> 43:49.208
Get Up and Glow!

43:49.375 --> 43:51.708
I was all over them in middle school.

43:51.875 --> 43:54.625
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, I was a Glow Girly. Relax.

43:54.792 --> 43:58.333
No! We need a band they think is cool,
not one we actually like.

43:58.500 --> 44:00.417
Quick, recall everything we know about music.

44:16.833 --> 44:19.167
We have to know one cool song, right?

44:21.625 --> 44:23.333
-TripleDent gum
-Will make you smile

44:23.542 --> 44:24.792
Embarrassment, get that out of there!

44:24.958 --> 44:26.083
Come on, there's gotta be something in here.

44:26.250 --> 44:27.708
-I'm looking, I'm looking.
-Something better, something cool.

44:27.875 --> 44:30.458
Come on. No, not that. No.

44:30.958 --> 44:32.000
This is the best we have!

44:32.167 --> 44:34.708
It's mostly jingles
and Dad's yacht rock.

44:34.875 --> 44:38.458
But, I mean, you don't still like
Get Up and Glow, do you?

44:38.875 --> 44:40.542
Okay, don't panic. What do we do?

44:40.708 --> 44:44.000
If we don't like their music,
we have nothing to offer these girls.

44:44.167 --> 44:45.708
We'll be outed as the imposter
that we obviously are.

44:45.792 --> 44:46.625
Pardon. Excusez moi.

44:46.708 --> 44:49.708
I've been waiting my whole life
for this very moment.

44:50.875 --> 44:54.083
Yeah. I love Get Up and Glow.

44:54.250 --> 44:56.583
Love Get Up and Glow.

45:02.917 --> 45:04.417
Abandon broccoli!

45:12.667 --> 45:14.792
-Joy!
-Give us your hand! Come on.

45:16.625 --> 45:18.125
What is that?

45:18.292 --> 45:19.667
That's a Sar-chasm.

45:19.833 --> 45:21.250
It can open for miles!

45:21.417 --> 45:22.792
Run for your lives!

45:22.958 --> 45:25.083
Sar-chasm? Really?

45:25.250 --> 45:27.833
Get Up and Glow is my favorite band.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.667
But she loves Get Up and Glow.

45:29.833 --> 45:31.333
They choreograph their own dances.

45:31.500 --> 45:32.500
Okay, Joy…

45:32.667 --> 45:34.750
if we can't follow the stream,
we don't know where we're going.

45:34.917 --> 45:37.708
And if we don't know where we're going,
we can't follow the stream!

45:37.875 --> 45:41.833
It is an endless loop
of tragedy and consequence!

45:42.000 --> 45:43.583
Or we could just ask those guys.

45:43.750 --> 45:45.125
Oh, yeah. Or that.

45:45.292 --> 45:48.292
Boy, are we so lucky we ran into you guys!

45:48.792 --> 45:53.792
Boy, are we so lucky we ran into you guys!

45:55.042 --> 45:58.042
Please, we really need your help!

45:58.208 --> 46:00.875
We really need your help.

46:01.042 --> 46:02.250
What's their problem?

46:02.583 --> 46:04.500
Guys, you just gotta turn on the charm.

46:04.958 --> 46:05.875
Hey!

46:06.250 --> 46:10.000
I bet you're the best crane crew
in the world!

46:10.167 --> 46:12.125
Wow, those guys are jerks.

46:13.750 --> 46:16.208
Wow, those guys are jerks.

46:16.375 --> 46:20.083
Yeah. Get Up and Glow is so awesome.

46:20.250 --> 46:23.458
Riley, what are you talking about?
You love Get Up and Glow.

46:24.375 --> 46:25.375
Hey, guys.

46:26.375 --> 46:29.042
Why are our best friends
always trying to hang out with us?

46:29.208 --> 46:31.750
Come on, Riley,
we just went to their concert.

46:31.917 --> 46:34.542
-Well, yeah. I mean, sure, but like…
-But what?

46:34.708 --> 46:35.708
We had a great time.

46:35.875 --> 46:37.125
Grace, you are not helping.

46:38.333 --> 46:40.333
Yeah, we had a great time.

46:40.833 --> 46:42.500
Great time.

46:44.458 --> 46:46.125
Why can't they just leave her alone?

46:46.292 --> 46:47.792
What are we gonna do now, Joy?

46:47.958 --> 46:50.208
We go the long way, which is the best way.

46:50.375 --> 46:52.708
Stretch those hammies, Anger. Let's go.

46:53.458 --> 46:55.458
Best night of my life.

46:55.625 --> 46:57.458
Well, this has been really fun.

46:57.625 --> 46:58.750
Extremely.

46:58.917 --> 46:59.958
But we're gonna go now.

47:00.125 --> 47:01.542
Okay, bye.

47:02.167 --> 47:04.042
This is the best band ever!

47:04.208 --> 47:06.125
-Okay, Riley!
-Michigan knows what's up!

47:07.792 --> 47:10.958
See? As long as we like what they like,
we have all the friends we need.

47:11.250 --> 47:12.083
Night, guys.

47:12.250 --> 47:14.208
Well, I think I'm calling it a night.

47:14.625 --> 47:16.292
-Really?
-Yeah, it's late.

47:16.458 --> 47:18.583
Plus, I think you'll want to get some sleep
before tomorrow's scrimmage.

47:18.750 --> 47:19.750
What scrimmage?

47:19.917 --> 47:22.333
It's just something Coach always does
on the last day.

47:22.500 --> 47:24.125
It's how Val made the team as a freshman.

47:24.292 --> 47:25.292
Don't tell her that.

47:25.458 --> 47:28.667
Val scored two goals.
No freshman has ever done that.

47:28.833 --> 47:29.667
Dani, stop.

47:29.833 --> 47:32.000
Technically, it's not your tryout
for the next year…

47:32.167 --> 47:33.625
but it basically is.

47:34.417 --> 47:36.333
You'll do great. Just be yourself.

47:36.500 --> 47:37.542
Did you hear that?

47:37.708 --> 47:39.750
We could become a Fire Hawk, like, tomorrow.

47:39.917 --> 47:43.042
But how do we be ourself
if our new self isn't ready yet?

47:43.583 --> 47:44.500
Excellent point.

47:44.667 --> 47:46.542
Let's get these memories downstairs.

47:57.542 --> 47:59.708
Is that broccoli?

48:00.292 --> 48:02.500
We're getting deeper and deeper in, Joy.

48:02.667 --> 48:03.667
Great observation.

48:03.833 --> 48:06.000
The long way did turn out
to be a little longer than I thought.

48:06.167 --> 48:07.792
Anyway, who wants to sing a song?

48:07.958 --> 48:09.958
I know a song. It's called, "I give up."

48:10.125 --> 48:11.750
Or let's play the quiet game!

48:11.917 --> 48:13.542
One, two, three, hush.

48:13.917 --> 48:16.583
I'll tell you what we do, we go back
up there and we kick those…

48:16.750 --> 48:18.083
Anger, now is not the time.

48:18.250 --> 48:21.083
Joy, this is useless.
Real Riley is out there somewhere…

48:21.250 --> 48:23.333
-and we're never going to find her.
-You know what? Yeah, these can go.

48:23.500 --> 48:26.250
No, no, no, I can find her.
I just need to get a better view.

48:41.125 --> 48:43.208
Okay, well, this isn't working,
and that's fine.

48:43.375 --> 48:44.750
-Everything's fine.
-This is hopeless.

48:44.917 --> 48:46.917
I say we cut our losses and walk back.

48:47.083 --> 48:50.292
This whole trip is just a series
of deader and deader ends.

48:50.458 --> 48:52.458
Ever since that puberty alarm went off…

48:52.625 --> 48:55.167
nothing around here works
the way it's supposed to!

48:55.333 --> 48:57.333
I don't even recognize this place anymore.

48:57.500 --> 48:59.583
It's light out at 1:00 in the morning!

48:59.750 --> 49:03.208
I have never been inside so many jars
in my life.

49:03.375 --> 49:05.125
And the Riley we knew is gone!

49:05.292 --> 49:09.417
And if Joy can't see that, well, then,
she's delusional!

49:12.583 --> 49:13.875
Delusional?

49:14.042 --> 49:16.292
Of course I'm delusional!

49:16.458 --> 49:18.958
Do you know how hard it is
to stay positive all the time…

49:19.125 --> 49:22.625
when all you folks do
is complain, complain, complain?

49:22.792 --> 49:24.625
Jiminy mother-loving toaster strudel!

49:25.708 --> 49:27.458
Do you think I have all the answers?

49:27.625 --> 49:29.167
Of course I don't!

49:31.833 --> 49:34.792
We can't even find the back of our own mind.

49:38.750 --> 49:40.250
Anxiety is right!

49:40.875 --> 49:44.500
Riley doesn't need us as much
as she needs them.

49:47.000 --> 49:48.750
And that hurts.

49:49.625 --> 49:50.875
It really hurts.

49:55.917 --> 49:57.958
Joy, you've made a lot of mistakes.

49:58.125 --> 49:59.125
A lot.

49:59.708 --> 50:02.417
And you'll make a whole lot more
in the future.

50:03.458 --> 50:07.583
But if you let that stop you,
we might as well lie down and give up now.

50:07.750 --> 50:09.375
Well, actually, that does sound kinda nice.

50:11.125 --> 50:12.250
Come on.

50:19.083 --> 50:20.708
-Excuse us.
-Hey! You can't use that.

50:20.875 --> 50:22.958
-Riley emergency.
-Thank you!

50:23.625 --> 50:24.625
Hop on!

50:39.542 --> 50:40.708
Let's just forget that ever happened.

50:40.875 --> 50:42.167
You don't have to ask me twice.

50:46.583 --> 50:47.583
Look.

50:51.542 --> 50:53.250
We're right behind you.

51:02.792 --> 51:03.792
This is great.

51:03.958 --> 51:05.417
The Fire Hawks have accepted us.

51:05.583 --> 51:08.125
But if Coach doesn't put us on the team,
none of that matters.

51:08.292 --> 51:09.792
Tomorrow is everything.

51:09.958 --> 51:11.917
Which is why we're gonna need more help.

51:12.083 --> 51:13.250
Ennui, are you paying attention?

51:13.417 --> 51:14.250
No.

51:14.417 --> 51:15.250
Embarrassment?

51:15.417 --> 51:17.250
-Well, this has been really fun.
-Embarrassment?

51:17.417 --> 51:18.500
-Extremely.
-Never mind.

51:18.667 --> 51:21.000
-But we're gonna go.
-Okay, bye.

51:32.292 --> 51:34.750
Now, let's see. What am I looking for?

51:35.292 --> 51:36.583
Don't you just hate it
when you go to do something…

51:36.750 --> 51:38.792
and then you get there to do it,
and you forget what you were gonna do?

51:38.958 --> 51:40.625
We'll need all the help we can get.

51:40.792 --> 51:42.083
That is exactly what I was thinking.

51:54.042 --> 51:55.708
Most important game of our lives.

52:06.458 --> 52:09.083
All right, guys, it's gonna be a long night.

52:11.208 --> 52:12.917
So let's get the team ready.

52:14.583 --> 52:16.125
Come on. We just need to cut through…

52:17.542 --> 52:19.042
Imagination Land!

52:19.333 --> 52:20.667
You guys are gonna love it.

52:20.833 --> 52:23.875
There's French Fry forest
and Cloud Town and…

52:26.083 --> 52:27.958
This place has changed.

52:29.208 --> 52:31.500
Mount Crushmore?

52:31.667 --> 52:33.042
Those are her top four?

52:33.208 --> 52:35.458
The only one that matters is Lance.

52:35.625 --> 52:37.208
Well, at least they got his good side.

52:37.375 --> 52:39.083
Every side is his good side.

52:39.958 --> 52:41.500
The Rumor Mill?

52:41.917 --> 52:43.458
Where all of our good gossip comes from.

52:44.417 --> 52:46.417
Pipin' hot rumors right off the mill!

52:46.583 --> 52:48.708
"The teacher's lounge has a hot tub"?

52:48.875 --> 52:51.417
"Lucy from math class is legit psychic"?

52:51.583 --> 52:55.333
"Abbie R's been texting Mike T,
but Mike T's been obsessing over Sarah M"?

52:55.500 --> 52:57.042
Where's the journalistic integrity?

52:57.208 --> 52:58.875
Fort Pillowton's still here!

52:59.042 --> 53:00.500
And it even got bigger.

53:02.375 --> 53:04.292
And orange?

53:08.167 --> 53:11.375
All right, 22, Riley breaks her leg
in practice, disappointing everyone.

53:11.542 --> 53:12.375
Nice job.

53:12.542 --> 53:15.333
Now, 18. Val and Dani whispering
after Riley misses a goal.

53:15.500 --> 53:18.208
Great! We need to help Riley prepare.

53:18.375 --> 53:21.667
Now's the time to send up every possible
thing that could go wrong.

53:21.833 --> 53:23.750
We are looking to the future.

53:24.042 --> 53:26.208
Every possible mistake she could make.

53:27.250 --> 53:30.625
Come on, 17. I'm not seeing
anything from you.

53:34.000 --> 53:36.083
Riley misses an open goal,
Coach writes about it in her notebook.

53:36.250 --> 53:37.083
Yes!

53:37.250 --> 53:38.583
More like that.

53:39.000 --> 53:39.833
Oh, no!

53:40.000 --> 53:41.958
They're using Riley's imagination
against her.

53:42.125 --> 53:44.542
Val and her friends like us now,
but if we don't make the team…

53:44.708 --> 53:46.042
will they like us tomorrow?

53:49.333 --> 53:50.917
Okay, let's go to number three.

53:51.083 --> 53:53.583
Bree and Grace's team win,
and we look stupid.

53:54.208 --> 53:57.125
Number 22. Val passes to us, and we miss it.

53:58.583 --> 54:00.083
We can't let her do this to Riley.

54:00.250 --> 54:01.917
We have to shut this down.

54:03.333 --> 54:06.917
Love it, 37. Riley hits the puck
into her own net.

54:07.958 --> 54:09.958
-Why are you drawing a hippo?
-I'm not.

54:10.417 --> 54:11.542
I'm drawing Riley!

54:11.708 --> 54:13.083
Joy, you forgot her ponytail.

54:13.250 --> 54:14.667
I love her pony tail. Yes!

54:15.583 --> 54:17.417
Riley scores and everyone hugs her?

54:17.583 --> 54:19.125
81, that is not helping.

54:19.292 --> 54:21.000
Riley paints her nails to match her jersey.

54:21.167 --> 54:23.625
Everybody copies her. And she is so cool.

54:23.792 --> 54:25.875
Riley wears knee pads.

54:26.042 --> 54:28.542
We buy flowers for the losing team!

54:29.250 --> 54:31.792
What? I can't always be the rage guy.

54:31.958 --> 54:33.333
No, no. I liked it.

54:33.500 --> 54:34.833
Nail polish? Knee pads?

54:35.000 --> 54:37.750
I'm starting to think you guys
don't understand the assignment.

54:38.292 --> 54:39.125
What…

54:42.708 --> 54:45.375
What? Who sent that projection to Riley?

54:45.542 --> 54:47.042
-Why would I know that?
-Don't look at me.

54:49.875 --> 54:51.042
What is going on?

54:51.208 --> 54:53.167
Who is sending all this positive…

54:54.833 --> 54:56.167
Joy.

54:56.333 --> 54:58.125
I know you're in there.

54:58.292 --> 54:59.708
-Is that really her?
-Is she really here?

54:59.875 --> 55:01.208
Joy from Headquarters?

55:01.375 --> 55:02.833
The mind police are on their way.

55:04.375 --> 55:05.542
Well, I think we gave it our best shot.

55:05.708 --> 55:07.542
Don't listen to Anxiety.

55:07.708 --> 55:11.042
She's using these horrible projections
to change Riley.

55:11.208 --> 55:13.042
Joy, I'm doing this for you!

55:13.208 --> 55:15.208
This is all so Riley can be happier.

55:15.375 --> 55:19.292
If you wanted her to be happy,
then you'd stop hurting her.

55:19.667 --> 55:20.667
Who's with me?

55:23.833 --> 55:25.583
Really? Nothing?

55:25.750 --> 55:27.167
Sorry, Joy.

55:28.167 --> 55:30.208
Yeah! I see you, 87.

55:30.375 --> 55:31.250
A cat.

55:31.417 --> 55:33.333
A little off-topic, but I'll take it.

55:33.500 --> 55:35.042
Who else? Come on!

55:35.208 --> 55:37.625
What if Riley is better than Val
and then Val hates her?

55:37.792 --> 55:40.917
Or what if Riley is better than Val
and Val respects her?

55:41.792 --> 55:43.208
Yeah! There we go!

55:44.125 --> 55:47.958
What if Riley is so bad
she has to give up hockey forever?

55:48.125 --> 55:50.792
What if Riley does so well
that the coach cries…

55:50.958 --> 55:52.208
and the Olympics call…

55:52.375 --> 55:55.417
and she rallies a weary nation to victory?

55:55.583 --> 55:57.500
Joy, reality is also a thing.

55:59.292 --> 56:00.208
No!

56:00.625 --> 56:04.958
Anxiety has got you all chained to desks,
drawing nightmares!

56:05.125 --> 56:07.625
But you don't have to take it anymore!

56:07.792 --> 56:09.958
Pencils down! Projections off!

56:10.125 --> 56:10.958
Yeah!

56:11.125 --> 56:12.458
Enough is enough!

56:15.542 --> 56:16.583
My projections!

56:16.750 --> 56:18.125
Pillow fight!

56:21.292 --> 56:22.667
For Riley!

56:22.833 --> 56:24.708
We need to be prepared.

56:28.458 --> 56:29.458
No!

56:32.208 --> 56:34.167
Okay, it's time to go!

56:34.333 --> 56:35.417
Yeah, I think so.

56:35.583 --> 56:37.667
-Bring it on, coppers!
-Oh, no, no, no.

56:41.792 --> 56:42.792
Hey, get back here!

56:42.958 --> 56:45.042
Quick! To the Parade of Future Careers!

56:48.333 --> 56:49.333
Grab a balloon!

56:49.667 --> 56:50.833
-A pastry chef!
-Underpaid!

56:51.000 --> 56:52.292
-Art teacher!
-Underappreciated.

56:53.125 --> 56:56.000
-Ethnomusicologist!
-I don't understand what that is.

56:56.167 --> 56:57.125
Supreme Court justice!

56:57.292 --> 56:58.167
-That's the one!
-I trust her judgment.

56:58.333 --> 56:59.167
Get back here!

57:00.708 --> 57:02.000
They're getting away!

57:04.583 --> 57:07.375
Yes! Now Riley can get some sleep.

57:08.000 --> 57:09.958
I miss the jar!

57:10.125 --> 57:11.542
Joy doesn't get it.

57:11.708 --> 57:13.917
Without our projections,
we won't be prepared.

57:14.083 --> 57:15.625
Tomorrow's game is everything.

57:15.792 --> 57:20.500
Coach will either make us a Fire Hawk
or doom us to a friendless future.

57:20.667 --> 57:22.958
I wish we knew what Coach thought about us.

57:24.250 --> 57:26.750
-Her notebook!
-Yes! That's a great idea!

57:27.417 --> 57:29.292
Everything Coach thinks about you
is in there.

57:30.625 --> 57:33.250
All we got to do is sneak into her office
and read it.

57:37.542 --> 57:38.958
Come on, Riley. Move those feet.

57:39.708 --> 57:40.750
She doesn't want to?

57:41.375 --> 57:42.833
Are we pushing her too hard?

57:43.000 --> 57:44.750
We got to see what's in the notebook!

57:44.917 --> 57:46.792
It's the only way for us
to know how we can do better.

57:55.708 --> 57:57.458
Riley, no.

58:00.167 --> 58:02.250
Joy? Come in, Joy.

58:02.417 --> 58:04.375
Sadness? Sadness, what's wrong?

58:04.542 --> 58:06.167
Why is Riley awake again? Over.

58:06.958 --> 58:09.833
Anxiety is making Riley
break into the coach's office.

58:10.000 --> 58:11.750
-What?
-She knows better than that.

58:11.917 --> 58:14.333
She will once we get her Sense of Self back.

58:14.500 --> 58:16.583
Sadness, you have to stop her.

58:16.750 --> 58:18.583
Just don't get caught.

58:19.458 --> 58:20.292
Over!

59:10.333 --> 59:12.333
No, Riley, no.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.000
Why did she stop?

59:32.625 --> 59:33.750
Sadness?

59:34.167 --> 59:35.583
Ennui! Where's your phone?

59:36.208 --> 59:37.750
My phone? Where is my phone?

59:37.917 --> 59:39.750
Seriously? This is not happening!

59:40.042 --> 59:41.208
No, no, no!

59:41.375 --> 59:43.750
Okay, she's got to be here somewhere.
Find her.

59:44.583 --> 59:45.583
Gotcha!

01:00:02.167 --> 01:00:03.375
Sadness.

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.167
No.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.542
I know Riley sneaking around feels wrong.

01:00:09.708 --> 01:00:11.708
This isn't who Riley is.

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:14.292
It's not about who Riley is.

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:16.792
It's about who she needs to be.

01:00:31.458 --> 01:00:33.083
"Not ready yet"?

01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.833
Wait. Coach already decided?

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.208
We're not making the team?

01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:39.458
No. We have one day left.

01:00:39.625 --> 01:00:40.958
What do we do? What can we do?

01:00:41.125 --> 01:00:42.458
-Okay, okay, okay.
-What would Val do?

01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:45.625
Well, we're just gonna
have to change Coach's mind.

01:00:45.792 --> 01:00:47.333
Which means we're gonna need ideas.

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:48.542
Lots of them.

01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:58.500
Oh, no. It's a Brainstorm!

01:00:59.583 --> 01:01:00.583
Too close!

01:01:01.667 --> 01:01:03.125
Hog the puck?

01:01:03.292 --> 01:01:05.292
Trash talk the other team?

01:01:08.750 --> 01:01:09.708
Yes!

01:01:11.958 --> 01:01:14.208
We can't let these bad ideas get to Riley.

01:01:15.333 --> 01:01:16.167
Joy!

01:01:18.083 --> 01:01:20.292
-Smash as many as you can!
-Joy!

01:01:22.083 --> 01:01:23.125
Joy!

01:01:28.958 --> 01:01:31.417
I'll start sorting these into ideas
I wish I'd thought of.

01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:33.583
Oh, no, no, no.
None of these are good enough.

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:34.583
We need more.

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:35.583
Get more!

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:39.208
Get on the balloon!

01:01:43.833 --> 01:01:45.875
This is worse than the broccoli!

01:01:49.667 --> 01:01:51.292
Quick! Grab an idea.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.750
These ideas are too small.

01:01:55.917 --> 01:01:57.292
These ideas are too small!

01:01:57.458 --> 01:01:59.000
We need something bigger.

01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:04.542
That's our way out!

01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:11.125
Ready?

01:02:18.333 --> 01:02:20.333
Joy! We need this idea!

01:02:20.667 --> 01:02:23.250
If Riley takes one of these ideas,
it could be a disaster!

01:02:23.417 --> 01:02:25.500
Joy, the only way out is up.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.042
That's a big idea!

01:02:43.125 --> 01:02:44.167
I like it.

01:02:45.542 --> 01:02:46.542
Oh, no.

01:02:50.625 --> 01:02:52.167
Hold me!

01:02:52.583 --> 01:02:54.167
Seriously. Hold me!

01:02:56.167 --> 01:02:58.833
Fear, you have a parachute?

01:02:59.125 --> 01:02:59.958
Yes.

01:03:00.125 --> 01:03:01.917
The real question is, why don't any of you?

01:03:03.292 --> 01:03:05.750
-Land! Yes! Stuck the landing!
-Yes!

01:03:05.917 --> 01:03:06.958
We did it!

01:03:07.125 --> 01:03:08.125
We made it!

01:03:08.292 --> 01:03:10.292
Come on, to the Back of the Mind!

01:03:10.458 --> 01:03:12.458
You're finished, Anxiety!

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:17.125
Coach is right.
Riley isn't ready.

01:03:17.292 --> 01:03:20.708
But we're so close
to a new Riley who is.

01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:22.167
This is what we're missing.

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:26.833
We show them we're a Fire Hawk
who will do whatever it takes.

01:03:48.542 --> 01:03:50.958
Finally, we're one of them!

01:03:51.125 --> 01:03:52.417
What do you think, Sadness?

01:03:52.583 --> 01:03:53.750
-Well, I…
-Awesome!

01:03:54.083 --> 01:03:55.292
Red is really our color.

01:03:55.458 --> 01:03:57.875
Yeah, no, I mean, it's so much fun.

01:04:03.958 --> 01:04:06.708
Okay, it's giving jealousy.
I'm sorry.

01:04:06.875 --> 01:04:09.250
They wouldn't know cool
if it hit them in the face.

01:04:09.542 --> 01:04:10.833
Hey, Michigan.

01:04:11.917 --> 01:04:13.417
Rocking the red, huh?

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.667
-Yes!
-We are in.

01:04:16.167 --> 01:04:17.167
I hope it's okay.

01:04:17.333 --> 01:04:18.792
I know I'm not officially a Fire Hawk yet…

01:04:18.958 --> 01:04:20.292
but I figured since we're
on the same team…

01:04:20.458 --> 01:04:21.500
we should match, right?

01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:22.708
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.

01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:24.333
Did you sleep last night?

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.625
No, how could I? Big game today!

01:04:26.792 --> 01:04:28.208
You mean the camp scrimmage?

01:04:28.375 --> 01:04:30.708
See? I told you not to freak her out.

01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:33.000
You're all good, okay?
I see you're in your zone.

01:04:33.167 --> 01:04:34.958
Get ready to score some goals.

01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:36.458
Yeah! I will!

01:04:36.667 --> 01:04:39.292
Val scored two goals in the scrimmage
to become a Fire Hawk.

01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:41.042
And you know what's better than two?

01:04:41.208 --> 01:04:42.125
-Three!
-Three!

01:04:42.292 --> 01:04:45.000
I was just about to say that.
We were about to say that at the same time.

01:04:45.167 --> 01:04:48.125
But how are we gonna score three goals?

01:04:48.292 --> 01:04:50.250
The new Riley will handle anything.

01:04:50.417 --> 01:04:53.083
And I think this is the finishing touch.

01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:57.417
I'll be right back.

01:05:02.667 --> 01:05:03.667
Come on!

01:05:03.958 --> 01:05:05.042
We're so close.

01:05:05.208 --> 01:05:07.167
The Sense of Self is just on top of that…

01:05:11.875 --> 01:05:13.292
That is a lot.

01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:15.583
This is more than I remember
sending back here.

01:05:16.417 --> 01:05:18.875
When she walked into
that glass door at that party.

01:05:19.167 --> 01:05:21.583
Yeah, and breaking Grandma's favorite plate.

01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:23.792
Thank goodness these aren't part of her.

01:05:23.958 --> 01:05:25.333
Yeah.

01:05:39.292 --> 01:05:40.292
There it is.

01:05:46.458 --> 01:05:49.292
I'm a good person.

01:05:49.625 --> 01:05:50.625
Oh, no.

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:02.417
Yes. Come on, come on.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.625
Here we go!

01:06:06.625 --> 01:06:07.708
I'm not good enough.

01:06:09.417 --> 01:06:10.250
What?

01:06:10.417 --> 01:06:12.625
I'm not good enough.

01:06:14.250 --> 01:06:15.958
I'm not good enough.

01:06:18.417 --> 01:06:19.417
Are you sure?

01:06:19.583 --> 01:06:20.417
Don't worry.

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:22.583
It's just that she knows that there's
always room for self-improvement.

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:23.750
She'll be fine.

01:06:26.333 --> 01:06:27.792
Sadness, we have the Sense of Self.

01:06:27.958 --> 01:06:28.958
Bring us back!

01:06:29.250 --> 01:06:30.375
Sadness, do you copy?

01:06:34.292 --> 01:06:36.083
I'm not good enough.

01:06:45.208 --> 01:06:46.583
Okay, I can work with this.

01:06:46.750 --> 01:06:49.042
I just need to recalibrate the console
and make sure it's ready.

01:06:49.208 --> 01:06:50.708
Just no more surprises.

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:53.250
Okay, this one goes here.
Check.

01:06:53.417 --> 01:06:54.542
That one goes there.
Check.

01:06:54.708 --> 01:06:56.083
Not exactly there.
Here.

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:59.292
Come on. Turn it up a little bit.
It's got to be absolutely perfect.

01:06:59.458 --> 01:07:01.458
That one is definitely wrong.
What is happening?

01:07:01.625 --> 01:07:02.875
Sadness, now!

01:07:14.458 --> 01:07:15.292
Joy…

01:07:15.458 --> 01:07:17.167
Oh, no!

01:07:35.292 --> 01:07:38.208
I'm a good person.

01:07:38.667 --> 01:07:40.667
I'm not good enough.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.125
That was our only way back.

01:07:46.292 --> 01:07:48.083
-What do we do?
-We were so close.

01:07:57.167 --> 01:07:58.250
Joy. Joy!

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:00.292
Where are you going?

01:08:17.167 --> 01:08:19.250
Twenty-eight! Andersen, tripping!

01:08:22.375 --> 01:08:24.500
Twenty-eight! Andersen, tripping!

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:32.832
Twenty-eight! Andersen, tripping!

01:08:35.082 --> 01:08:37.000
I expected better, Riley.

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.707
That's not…

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:48.542
What…

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:57.667
Come on, please.

01:08:59.207 --> 01:09:00.625
What am I missing?

01:09:06.082 --> 01:09:09.000
I'm a good person.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.625
Joy…

01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:20.667
so what do we do now?

01:09:29.292 --> 01:09:30.750
I don't know.

01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:34.792
I don't know how to stop Anxiety.

01:09:37.582 --> 01:09:39.042
Maybe we can't.

01:09:41.082 --> 01:09:43.832
Maybe this is what happens
when you grow up.

01:09:45.042 --> 01:09:47.292
You feel less joy.

01:09:54.207 --> 01:09:55.583
But I do know this.

01:09:58.708 --> 01:10:03.000
Riley will never be herself if we don't
get this back to Headquarters.

01:10:03.458 --> 01:10:04.667
Fast.

01:10:05.917 --> 01:10:07.208
How?

01:10:11.125 --> 01:10:12.583
Have a good game, Riley.

01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:14.083
You too.

01:10:16.625 --> 01:10:17.875
I'm not good enough.

01:10:24.833 --> 01:10:26.500
Yes! Go, go, go!

01:10:27.417 --> 01:10:29.875
Riley, I'm open. Pass it, pass it!

01:10:30.042 --> 01:10:31.333
I'm not good enough.

01:10:37.292 --> 01:10:38.333
Yeah, Michigan!

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.333
Leave some for the rest of us, huh?

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:42.458
Yes! One down, two to go.

01:10:43.042 --> 01:10:46.500
Okay, so how do we get our Sense of Self
from here to there?

01:10:48.625 --> 01:10:52.167
I have an idea, but I really don't like it.

01:10:52.333 --> 01:10:54.208
Anger, Riley needs us.

01:10:56.375 --> 01:10:59.042
Oh, Pouchy!

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.333
Well, what are you waiting for?
Say the words!

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.542
Oh, Pouchy!

01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:15.250
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

01:11:15.417 --> 01:11:16.250
We know.

01:11:16.417 --> 01:11:17.958
Pouchy, we need to get back to Headquarters.

01:11:18.125 --> 01:11:19.708
Do you have anything that can help us?

01:11:19.875 --> 01:11:21.500
I have lots of items.

01:11:21.667 --> 01:11:23.875
Which one do you think will work the best?

01:11:24.042 --> 01:11:25.208
A roll of tape…

01:11:25.375 --> 01:11:27.458
-a rubber ducky…
-No time!

01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:32.208
Seriously, Pouchy? Dynamite?

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:35.750
Don't you have, like, a jetpack or a plane
or something that's going to help us?

01:11:35.917 --> 01:11:37.625
What do you think, I have everything in here?

01:11:37.792 --> 01:11:40.333
I offered you the rubber ducky,
I offered you the tape.

01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:41.417
I know what to do.

01:11:41.583 --> 01:11:43.583
But we're gonna need a lot more dynamite.

01:11:44.708 --> 01:11:46.375
You know what? Good luck…

01:11:50.125 --> 01:11:51.583
Come on, Riley. Get the puck!

01:11:52.125 --> 01:11:53.292
Take it, take it!

01:11:55.083 --> 01:11:56.708
I'm not good enough.

01:11:57.958 --> 01:11:59.583
Michigan, what are you doing?

01:12:00.375 --> 01:12:01.875
We're on the same team!

01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:09.625
Yes!

01:12:10.417 --> 01:12:12.625
Well, Dani might be a little mad at us…

01:12:12.792 --> 01:12:14.625
but they'll all forgive us
when we make the team.

01:12:14.792 --> 01:12:17.208
Come on, Riley. One more goal.

01:12:22.375 --> 01:12:23.417
Hold on, Joy.

01:12:23.583 --> 01:12:25.292
-We're gonna blow up this cliff?
-Yep!

01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:29.042
And then we'll ride an avalanche
of bad memories back to Headquarters?

01:12:29.208 --> 01:12:30.042
Yeah!

01:12:30.208 --> 01:12:33.167
And how do we keep the bad memories
from forming bad beliefs?

01:12:33.542 --> 01:12:34.750
I don't know.

01:12:36.042 --> 01:12:38.542
Yeah! What could go wrong?
I'm in!

01:12:38.708 --> 01:12:39.625
Ready?

01:12:39.792 --> 01:12:40.792
-For Riley.
-Let's do it.

01:12:40.958 --> 01:12:42.833
Here we come, Riley.

01:12:56.708 --> 01:12:57.667
Jump on!

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:23.750
Come on!

01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:25.958
Man!

01:13:27.667 --> 01:13:29.125
I'm not good enough.

01:13:29.292 --> 01:13:31.042
You have to score!

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:43.375
Andersen, penalty box, two minutes.

01:13:43.542 --> 01:13:44.417
No!

01:13:45.167 --> 01:13:46.792
Grace, are you okay?

01:13:50.792 --> 01:13:51.833
We hurt Grace.

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.708
It all happened so fast.
I didn't even see her.

01:14:01.333 --> 01:14:02.708
I'm not good enough.

01:14:02.875 --> 01:14:04.458
Oh, no. What did I do?

01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:07.708
No, no.

01:14:08.875 --> 01:14:10.042
I can fix it, I can fix it.

01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:51.375
I expected better, Riley.

01:14:52.292 --> 01:14:53.500
Wait… No!

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000
Come on.

01:14:57.292 --> 01:14:58.708
I'm not good enough.

01:14:59.417 --> 01:15:00.417
Come on, Riley.

01:15:00.833 --> 01:15:01.875
Get it together.

01:15:02.042 --> 01:15:03.458
Come on, Riley, get it together.

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.167
I'm not good enough.

01:15:06.375 --> 01:15:08.375
You have to score, Riley!

01:15:08.542 --> 01:15:10.542
Or this will all have been for nothing!

01:15:10.708 --> 01:15:12.750
Anxiety, you're putting too much pressure
on her.

01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:33.000
Okay, let's take a breather!

01:15:43.542 --> 01:15:46.250
-Sadness!
-Joy! Help!

01:15:47.875 --> 01:15:49.667
Come on! We can do this!

01:15:50.625 --> 01:15:52.000
It's not working!

01:15:52.167 --> 01:15:53.250
It's Anxiety.

01:16:10.542 --> 01:16:12.125
Anxiety, stop!

01:16:18.583 --> 01:16:21.125
You don't get to choose who Riley is.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:28.333
Anxiety…

01:16:33.667 --> 01:16:35.250
you need to let her go.

01:16:59.292 --> 01:17:01.292
I'm a good person.

01:17:12.417 --> 01:17:13.417
Joy.

01:17:14.208 --> 01:17:15.500
I'm sorry.

01:17:16.875 --> 01:17:19.625
I was just trying to protect her.

01:17:21.375 --> 01:17:22.625
But you're right.

01:17:23.542 --> 01:17:27.125
We don't get to choose who Riley is.

01:17:32.042 --> 01:17:35.708
We keep the best and toss the rest.

01:17:48.083 --> 01:17:50.208
Twenty-eight. Andersen, tripping.

01:18:13.875 --> 01:18:15.542
I'm a good person.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.458
Joy! What are you doing?

01:18:35.917 --> 01:18:37.208
I'm selfish.

01:18:38.375 --> 01:18:39.583
I'm kind.

01:18:41.083 --> 01:18:42.833
I'm not good enough.

01:18:43.875 --> 01:18:45.458
I'm a good person.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:47.625
I need to fit in…

01:18:48.125 --> 01:18:50.000
but I want to be myself.

01:18:50.417 --> 01:18:52.458
I'm brave, but I get scared.

01:18:52.625 --> 01:18:54.417
Success is everything.
I make mistakes.

01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:55.750
I'm nice.
I'm mean.

01:18:55.917 --> 01:18:56.750
I'm a good friend.

01:18:56.917 --> 01:18:57.833
I'm a terrible friend.
I am strong.

01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.667
I'm weak.
I need help sometimes.

01:19:58.792 --> 01:20:01.208
Riley, you okay?

01:20:09.625 --> 01:20:10.500
Yeah.

01:20:11.042 --> 01:20:13.458
I mean no.

01:20:17.083 --> 01:20:19.417
I was such a jerk to you guys.

01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:24.792
When you guys told me you were going
to a different school, I freaked out.

01:20:24.958 --> 01:20:26.000
And…

01:20:28.833 --> 01:20:30.125
I'm so sorry.

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:34.667
If you don't want to be friends anymore…

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000
I get it.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.125
But…

01:20:39.292 --> 01:20:41.375
I really hope that you can forgive me.

01:20:42.792 --> 01:20:43.875
Someday.

01:21:11.417 --> 01:21:12.750
-Let's go, ladies!
-Come on.

01:21:12.917 --> 01:21:14.500
We've got a game to finish.

01:21:43.458 --> 01:21:44.458
Joy…

01:21:44.875 --> 01:21:46.917
Riley wants you.

01:22:22.167 --> 01:22:23.167
Riley!

01:23:07.417 --> 01:23:08.458
Yes!

01:23:30.667 --> 01:23:32.917
Hey, Minnesota, how long are you gonna stare
at your phone?

01:23:33.083 --> 01:23:36.167
It's almost 2:00.
Coach is gonna post the list any minute.

01:23:36.333 --> 01:23:38.667
-Okay. 2:00 p.m. That's in…
-Six minutes.

01:23:38.833 --> 01:23:40.125
And what happens
if we don't become a Fire Hawk?

01:23:40.292 --> 01:23:42.750
Well, thanks for asking, Joy. I'll tell you.

01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:44.917
First, Mom and Dad
are very disappointed.

01:23:45.083 --> 01:23:47.167
We don't go pro, and we find work
as an ethnomusicologist…

01:23:47.333 --> 01:23:48.458
even though we don't really know
what that is.

01:23:48.625 --> 01:23:50.792
We have no friends, and we die alone.

01:23:51.125 --> 01:23:52.167
Okay, okay.

01:23:52.333 --> 01:23:54.167
None of that is happening right now.

01:23:54.333 --> 01:23:55.333
-Is it?
-No.

01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:58.417
Great! So why don't we take a seat
in our special chair.

01:23:58.583 --> 01:24:00.625
Yeah, that's a great idea.

01:24:01.125 --> 01:24:02.542
See? Isn't that better?

01:24:02.708 --> 01:24:04.917
Yeah, that's the stuff.

01:24:05.208 --> 01:24:07.250
We can't control whether Riley
makes the team.

01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:08.875
But what can we control?

01:24:09.042 --> 01:24:10.083
Well…

01:24:10.458 --> 01:24:12.667
Riley has a Spanish test tomorrow.
We need to study.

01:24:12.833 --> 01:24:15.000
-You're right. We totally…
-Olvidamos!

01:24:15.083 --> 01:24:16.375
-What's that mean?
-"Forgot."

01:24:16.708 --> 01:24:18.333
-Someone paid attention in class.
-I never would've thought of that.

01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:19.708
-You're clearly an expert.
-Muchas gracias.

01:24:19.792 --> 01:24:20.917
Thanks, guys.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:24.333
Plus, we followed our new
varsity caliber training program.

01:24:24.625 --> 01:24:25.708
I wish I thought of that.

01:24:25.875 --> 01:24:27.333
Newsflash, you did!

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:28.917
Wait, you're right, I did.

01:24:29.417 --> 01:24:31.625
I'm jealous of myself.
Thanks for the reminder.

01:24:31.792 --> 01:24:32.958
You're welcome!

01:24:33.125 --> 01:24:35.375
-Who said that?
-It's my new buddy, Pouchy.

01:24:35.542 --> 01:24:37.417
Hi, everybody. I'm Pouchy!

01:24:37.583 --> 01:24:39.167
Confetti if we make the team!

01:24:39.333 --> 01:24:40.458
Good idea.

01:24:41.083 --> 01:24:43.375
That's great, but either way,
we love our girl.

01:24:43.542 --> 01:24:44.875
Confetti if we don't!

01:24:47.958 --> 01:24:51.042
-Is it Coach's email?
-No. It's Bree and Grace.

01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.208
I miss those girls.

01:24:55.125 --> 01:24:57.000
Remember when Bree and Grace…

01:24:57.167 --> 01:24:58.417
-and us used to…
-You're still early.

01:24:58.583 --> 01:24:59.958
-No, no, no. Too early.
-Go downstairs.

01:25:00.125 --> 01:25:02.625
I'll just be downstairs if you need me.

01:25:02.792 --> 01:25:04.250
It's 3 minutes to 2:00.

01:25:04.417 --> 01:25:06.875
-She's got this.
-'Cause she's got us.

01:25:07.708 --> 01:25:12.375
Yeah! Right? 'Cause she's… Maybe?

01:25:12.542 --> 01:25:14.042
All right, Embarrassment.

01:25:14.208 --> 01:25:16.042
Everybody, look at Embarrassment!

01:25:18.417 --> 01:25:21.542
Hey, look, if you don't make it this year,
there's always next year.

01:25:21.875 --> 01:25:22.792
I know.

01:25:23.208 --> 01:25:25.625
-I love our girl.
-How could you not?

01:25:25.792 --> 01:25:27.125
She's super smart.

01:25:27.292 --> 01:25:28.667
And great at hockey.

01:25:28.833 --> 01:25:30.125
She's really creative.

01:25:30.292 --> 01:25:32.583
She can be bored, but never boring.

01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:35.375
But she can be a little sarcastic
from time to time.

01:25:35.542 --> 01:25:38.542
She can have really bad ideas.

01:25:38.708 --> 01:25:41.417
Occasionally, she can do
the wrong thing.

01:25:41.583 --> 01:25:44.625
And sometimes,
she can be too hard on herself.

01:25:44.958 --> 01:25:47.708
But every bit of Riley makes her who she is.

01:25:48.417 --> 01:25:50.625
And we love all of our girl.

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.833
Every messy, beautiful piece of her.

01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:27.042
So, Riley, how was camp?

01:26:28.083 --> 01:26:30.792
Okay, we talked about this.
We tell them everything.

01:26:32.250 --> 01:26:34.417
-But what about sneaking into Coach's office?
-What about hitting Grace?

01:26:34.583 --> 01:26:36.500
-Remember the lying?
-Are we gonna tell her about the Fire Hawks?

01:26:36.667 --> 01:26:38.208
-She doesn't need to know.
-Objection.

01:26:38.292 --> 01:26:39.375
Pardon. Excusez moi.

01:26:40.667 --> 01:26:41.667
It was good.

01:26:43.792 --> 01:26:46.917
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

01:26:47.083 --> 01:26:48.208
And what about the red in her hair?

01:26:48.375 --> 01:26:49.375
Did she join a gang?

01:26:49.542 --> 01:26:51.000
Welcome back, Anxiety.

01:26:52.875 --> 01:26:56.500
She goes away for three days
and all we get is, "good"?

01:26:57.125 --> 01:26:59.458
Yeah. Sounds right.
Back to the game.

01:26:59.625 --> 01:27:01.500
With a nice pass over to Reeves…

01:27:01.667 --> 01:27:03.125
comes across center ice.

01:27:03.292 --> 01:27:05.708
Down to the line. Oh, what a move!

01:34:45.583 --> 01:34:48.250
Okay, Deep Dark Secret.

01:34:48.417 --> 01:34:49.625
It's time.

01:34:50.917 --> 01:34:54.417
It's okay. Come on.

01:34:56.625 --> 01:34:59.000
Okay. Let it go, buddy.

01:34:59.167 --> 01:35:00.417
What's the secret?

01:35:02.667 --> 01:35:05.542
We burn hole in rug.

01:35:05.833 --> 01:35:07.708
Really? That's it?

01:35:07.875 --> 01:35:10.292
I thought you were gonna say
the time we peed in the pool.

01:35:11.417 --> 01:35:12.500
No, wait.

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:15.708
And he's gone.
