02:17.560 --> 02:20.564
Come on, Laurie Anne. It's going to storm.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.081
Hi.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.448
Laurie Anne?

03:11.040 --> 03:13.964
Honey? Don't scare Mama now.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.486
Excuse me. Move along.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.691
Mmm-hmm.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.931
Chief's going to have a cow
when he sees you nosing around, Mike.

03:49.120 --> 03:51.441
I won't tell him if you don't.
What you got, Sam?

03:51.600 --> 03:54.001
There's not much left.
Just like the last time.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.162
- Anybody see anything?
- The mother said she saw...

03:56.320 --> 03:58.288
I thought I told you
to stay out of this, Hanlon.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.283
I'm just a concerned citizen, Chief.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.808
And I call six kids missing or dead
a major cause for alarm here.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.201
It may be just a rash of runaways.
Kids get itchy feet.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.886
Right. A five-year-old in a toy car
gets itchy feet.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.691
What, a seven-year-old trots down
to Acapulco for a wild weekend?

04:11.840 --> 04:14.161
The boy's father took him.
The other one...

04:14.840 --> 04:18.845
Chief, there's something terribly wrong
here in Derry. And you know it.

04:19.960 --> 04:22.804
Hey. I'm the cop. You're the librarian.

04:22.960 --> 04:23.961
Okay?

04:47.800 --> 04:48.847
Georgie.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.051
<i>May 28th.</i>

04:56.320 --> 04:57.890
<i>Another killing today.</i>

04:58.600 --> 05:02.525
<i>But this time, there was something more.
Something that makes my skin crawl.</i>

05:03.680 --> 05:06.490
<i>A picture that shouldn't...
No, no, that couldn't have been there.</i>

05:07.400 --> 05:09.607
<i>It's time to tell the others
what's happening.</i>

05:09.760 --> 05:11.569
<i>I can't put it off any longer.</i>

05:12.040 --> 05:13.451
<i>But I hope I'm wrong.</i>

05:14.400 --> 05:16.243
<i>Oh, I hope to God I'm wrong.</i>

05:32.560 --> 05:35.928
<i>Taggert steps onto the moors
as the fog curls around his ankles.</i>

05:36.080 --> 05:39.448
<i>He shivers, buttons his coat,
and walks on, disappearing into the mist.</i>

05:39.600 --> 05:41.364
<i>A shadowy figure lurches into frame,</i>

05:41.520 --> 05:44.126
<i>dripping with foul water
and dark oozing mud.</i>

05:45.120 --> 05:47.441
Yeah. Yeah.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.928
Bill, for the last time.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.121
In a minute!

05:52.440 --> 05:54.363
That's what you said a half an hour ago.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.046
<i>- And a half hour before that.</i>
- Okay!

05:58.560 --> 05:59.561
Okay.

06:03.040 --> 06:04.804
- It's cold.
- Sorry.

06:05.600 --> 06:08.046
I like the changes, Bill.
They're wonderful.

06:08.320 --> 06:11.802
- I wish you'd tell that idiot, Greco.
- I do. Every day.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.802
You didn't have to
take this job, you know.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.291
It's not as if we need the money.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.290
In case you've forgotten,
I took the job to be with you.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.367
Besides, if they're gonna hire somebody
to mangle one of my books,

06:22.520 --> 06:23.521
it might as well be me.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.843
Of course, the idea of actually taking
a vacation didn't even occur...

06:27.000 --> 06:28.729
So I could hang around the set
with a bunch of actors?

06:28.880 --> 06:31.281
That's not what I do, Audra.
Writing is what I do.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.920
At least when you're doing a novel,
you're in a good mood.

06:34.360 --> 06:36.647
Audra, could we...

06:38.560 --> 06:40.642
I'm asleep, unless it's Greco.

06:41.640 --> 06:42.641
Greco.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.481
Greco.

06:46.440 --> 06:47.441
Yeah?

06:47.600 --> 06:50.683
<i>Bill, is that you?</i>
- Sorry, fella, do I know you?

06:50.960 --> 06:53.440
<i>This is Mike Hanlon, Bill, from Derry.</i>

06:55.080 --> 06:56.411
<i>Swear to me.</i>

06:57.000 --> 06:59.128
Swear to me that if it isn't dead,

07:01.280 --> 07:03.009
we'll all come back.

07:06.240 --> 07:09.608
- Sorry, Mike, for a minute there...
<i>- You didn't know who I was.</i>

07:10.640 --> 07:12.324
For a minute there, I didn't.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.121
<i>Bill,</i>

07:15.360 --> 07:16.566
<i>It's back.</i>

07:17.320 --> 07:19.971
You're... Sure?

07:20.520 --> 07:24.525
<i>Yeah. I found a photograph of George.</i>

07:26.800 --> 07:27.801
George?

07:35.040 --> 07:36.041
What is it?

07:36.720 --> 07:38.210
Who was on the phone?

07:39.200 --> 07:42.204
Nobody. Wrong number.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.761
Bill?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.968
I have to go back to work.

07:49.840 --> 07:50.841
Bill?

07:55.960 --> 07:57.485
Georgie.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.686
Please, Bill. Tell me a story.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.963
Maybe later.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.123
The magic stone story.

08:29.480 --> 08:31.801
Please, Bill. Please.

08:32.440 --> 08:36.081
Go bug somebody else, you little cootie.
I don't feel so hot.

08:37.200 --> 08:38.201
Georgie?

08:41.680 --> 08:44.650
For me? You made it for me?

08:45.560 --> 08:47.005
Can I go sail it?

08:47.360 --> 08:52.366
Oh, well, you have to seal it
first with paraffin.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.482
- What's that? Where is it?
- It's in the cellar.

09:31.640 --> 09:35.247
I wish you could come, too.
She's your boat, really.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.481
Thanks, Bill.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.847
Yuck. You got cooties all over me.

09:46.720 --> 09:47.881
Uh, Georgie.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.011
Don't stay out too long,
or Mom will have a bird.

09:51.560 --> 09:54.086
- I won't.
- Georgie.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.001
Be careful.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.525
Sure. Sure, I will.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.520
SS Georgie!

10:15.040 --> 10:16.326
Come on, come on!

10:32.560 --> 10:34.722
<i>SS Georgie,</i> out of the way!

10:46.040 --> 10:47.246
No, please, no!

10:57.480 --> 10:59.164
<i>Hi, Georgie.</i>

11:02.880 --> 11:04.962
Aren't you going to say hello?

11:07.560 --> 11:08.686
Oh.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.763
Come on, bucko.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.922
Don't you want a balloon?

11:14.960 --> 11:17.804
I'm not supposed to take stuff
from strangers.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.007
My dad said so.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.725
Very wise of your dad, Georgie.
Very wise indeed.

11:24.760 --> 11:28.765
I, Georgie, am Pennywvise,
the Dancing Clown.

11:29.640 --> 11:31.688
You are Georgie.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.125
So, now we know each other.

11:34.920 --> 11:35.921
Correct?

11:36.400 --> 11:37.845
I guess so.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.610
- I've got to go.
<i>- Go?</i>

11:40.040 --> 11:42.042
Without this?

11:43.280 --> 11:45.886
- My boat!
- Exactly.

11:46.280 --> 11:49.284
Go on, kiddo. Take it.

11:52.080 --> 11:53.241
Oh...

11:54.400 --> 11:56.482
You want it, don't you, Georgie?

11:56.960 --> 11:58.689
<i>Of course you do.</i>

11:59.360 --> 12:03.809
And there's cotton candy and rides
and all sorts of surprises down here.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.005
And balloons, too. All colors.

12:07.600 --> 12:10.365
- Do they float?
- Oh, yes.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.649
They float, Georgie.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.165
They float.

12:19.080 --> 12:22.323
And when you're down here with me,

12:22.480 --> 12:24.960
you float, too!

12:29.200 --> 12:31.248
"Fear no evil for thou art with me,

12:31.520 --> 12:33.727
"thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

12:34.280 --> 12:38.001
"Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

12:38.160 --> 12:42.131
"Thou anointest my head with oil,
my cup runneth over.

12:42.360 --> 12:46.206
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.

12:46.360 --> 12:49.842
<i>"And I will dwell
in the house of the Lord forever."</i>

13:29.800 --> 13:31.086
Oh, Georgie.

13:39.560 --> 13:40.561
No.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.401
<i>Billy?</i>

13:55.760 --> 13:58.809
- Billy, are you all right?
- What's wrong, son? What is it?

13:59.000 --> 14:01.606
The picture. Georgie's picture.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.850
Mom, don't you see?

14:09.160 --> 14:10.161
<i>Mom.</i>

14:10.320 --> 14:13.802
- What were you doing in Georgie's room?
- Nothing.

14:13.960 --> 14:14.961
<i>Dad, listen!</i>

14:15.160 --> 14:18.403
I don't want you ever coming
in here again, son. Do you understand?

14:19.920 --> 14:21.604
- Dad.
- I mean it, Bill.

14:51.480 --> 14:52.641
I forgot.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.360
How could I forget?

14:56.440 --> 15:00.604
Leave? Have you lost your mind?
We're in the middle of making a movie.

15:00.760 --> 15:03.684
They can replace me.
This is something I have to do.

15:06.040 --> 15:07.963
Who was that on the phone?

15:10.680 --> 15:13.126
The call was from a guy named Mike Hanlon.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.802
I haven't heard from him in almost
30 years. Not since we were kids.

15:17.200 --> 15:21.205
- Audra. My brother, who died...
- Yes, George.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.645
He didn't just die.

15:23.920 --> 15:26.685
He was... Murdered.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.162
- Why didn't you ever...
- Tell you?

15:29.480 --> 15:33.804
Because I forgot. Because I forgot.
Almost as if it never happened.

15:33.960 --> 15:35.962
I know this doesn't make any sense,
but I have to go.

15:36.160 --> 15:37.366
For God's sake, why?

15:37.520 --> 15:40.171
Because we made a... promise.

15:40.320 --> 15:41.401
Why are you stuttering like that?

15:41.560 --> 15:44.006
I don't know.
I used to stutter when I was a kid.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.686
What happened? Tell me.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.690
Damn it, Bill, talk to me! Let me help.

15:51.280 --> 15:54.011
- If you're going back, I'm going, too.
- Don't even think that!

15:54.160 --> 15:57.050
- Why not? You're scaring me.
- You promise me you'll stay here.

15:57.200 --> 15:58.565
- Promise me!
- You're crazy.

15:58.720 --> 16:01.041
This is crazy.
Pro...

16:01.360 --> 16:02.725
It's just crazy.

16:05.560 --> 16:07.562
I love you.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.606
- Oops.
- Oh, no, Ben.

16:47.760 --> 16:51.207
Your architect award.
And you just received it. It's a tragedy.

16:51.400 --> 16:54.449
Yeah, honey.
We've got ourselves a real tragedy here.

16:54.600 --> 16:57.046
This is an American tragedy.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.921
Oh, look at this.
Would you hang on to this?

17:00.480 --> 17:02.289
I got this, and this, all right.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.768
- Okay.
- Come on.

17:06.600 --> 17:08.921
Here you are, my good man. Recycle.

17:09.920 --> 17:12.890
Here, wait a minute.
I got my magic, uh, opener.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.450
Come on, honey.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.804
Oh! Limbo! How low can you go?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.126
Whoo!

17:26.280 --> 17:28.442
No, no, no. You don't have to be quiet.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.207
- Is, is all this yours?
- Uh-huh. Come on in.

17:31.400 --> 17:33.402
Here, let me see what I can do with this.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.761
- Oh...
- Oops.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.650
It's so nice.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.924
Come here, beautiful. Come on.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.450
God, look at you!

18:04.840 --> 18:06.330
Ooh

18:06.920 --> 18:09.924
- I love your body.
- Ooh, I like yours, too.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.523
- Would you believe I used to be fat?
- I bet you were real cute.

18:13.680 --> 18:16.365
No, not just fat,
but a regular butterball.

18:16.680 --> 18:17.806
You bet your fern I was.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.525
We used to say that as kids.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.849
You bet your fern, but I was F-A-T.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.685
- No.
- Yeah.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.326
I hear bells. I'll be right back.

18:36.160 --> 18:37.161
Hello?

18:37.320 --> 18:38.970
<i>Haystack, it's me, Mike.</i>

18:40.040 --> 18:41.087
<i>You're dead, fat boy.</i>

18:42.080 --> 18:43.969
It's payback time, piggy.

18:45.440 --> 18:47.044
<i>You're gonna die, fat boy.</i>

18:47.200 --> 18:48.201
<i>Hey, fat boy!</i>

18:52.360 --> 18:53.361
<i>Ben?</i>

18:53.520 --> 18:54.885
<i>Ben, are you there?</i>

18:56.400 --> 18:58.721
- Mike?
<i>- Yeah, buddy. Listen.</i>

18:59.280 --> 19:01.760
<i>It... It's come back.</i>

19:04.360 --> 19:06.249
<i>How much do you remember?</i>

19:07.880 --> 19:09.882
<i>How much do you remember?</i>

19:11.920 --> 19:15.447
Very little. Almost nothing.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.284
<i>Will you come?</i>

19:19.440 --> 19:20.805
I'll come.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.046
Are you okay?

19:40.480 --> 19:44.485
I don't think I am, sweetheart.
Not tonight. Not at all.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.570
Are you gonna kill yourself?

19:48.480 --> 19:52.246
No, I don't think so.
Though it might be better if I did.

20:29.120 --> 20:31.930
<i>My name is Ben Hanscom.</i>

20:33.320 --> 20:36.563
Until last week,
I lived with my mom in Houston, Texas.

20:37.520 --> 20:39.488
<i>We moved here to live with my cousins.</i>

20:39.640 --> 20:41.085
Look at that gut.

20:44.680 --> 20:45.681
Go on, Ben.

20:46.360 --> 20:47.885
Have you any hobbies?

20:48.120 --> 20:49.360
Well, I like to read a lot.

20:49.640 --> 20:54.601
<i>Especially about old civilizations,
the Egyptians, the Indians.</i>

20:54.840 --> 20:58.925
We have a wonderful library here, Ben.
Welcome to Derry.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.122
Thank you, Miss Douglas.
Oink, oink.

21:12.800 --> 21:13.961
What a porker.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.045
Henry Bowers,

21:17.200 --> 21:20.204
you will stay for one hour after school
every day this week.

21:20.360 --> 21:21.885
My father will tan my hide.

21:22.040 --> 21:24.566
You should've thought of that
before you picked on Ben.

21:24.880 --> 21:26.882
<i>Now, report to the principal's office.</i>

21:33.000 --> 21:34.081
You're dead, fat boy.

21:41.240 --> 21:44.881
Boy. It's going to be
some funeral, friend.

21:54.520 --> 21:55.885
Now, class,

21:56.320 --> 22:01.451
as you know, the sheriff
00 p.m. curfew.

22:01.600 --> 22:04.001
<i>We live in dangerous times,
boys and girls.</i>

22:04.160 --> 22:06.561
<i>I want you to be careful.</i>

22:13.800 --> 22:16.804
Like this place so well
you're going to stand there all day?

22:16.960 --> 22:17.961
School's over, you know.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.248
- Excuse us, please.
- Can we get through?

22:20.440 --> 22:22.761
Honestly, Loni, some people have no class.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.922
Some people have janitors for parents.

22:29.160 --> 22:32.130
Well, so long, Ben Hanscom.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.364
I'm Beverly Marsh.

22:38.560 --> 22:40.608
Well, see you tomorrow, Beverly Marsh.

22:40.760 --> 22:45.402
Beverly Marsh. Beverly Marsh.
Beverly Marsh. Beverly Marsh.

22:50.200 --> 22:53.727
- Hey, look, it's the fat boy.
- Top of the day, fat boy.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.407
- What do you want?
- I want to teach you something, porky.

23:05.560 --> 23:06.766
You like to learn new things, don't you?

23:07.480 --> 23:09.084
Mmm-hmm.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.090
I want to make sure you remember my name.

23:11.480 --> 23:13.005
I'll remember, Henry. I'll remember.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.770
How am I gonna make sure? Huh?

23:20.400 --> 23:21.401
Hey, Henry.

23:22.480 --> 23:23.720
Come on, don't really cut him.

23:23.920 --> 23:25.251
Cut him? Huh?

23:26.200 --> 23:27.201
Cut him?

23:28.440 --> 23:30.568
Let's see, first comes...

23:30.760 --> 23:31.761
Oh, God!

23:34.840 --> 23:37.889
<i>You're going to die! You're dead!
I'm gonna bury you!</i>

23:38.040 --> 23:39.530
You're going to die!

23:41.000 --> 23:42.843
<i>I'm gonna bury you!</i>

23:49.520 --> 23:51.204
<i>Nobody kicks me, porky!</i>

23:51.480 --> 23:54.006
<i>Nobody kicks me! Nobody!
Come on, fat boy.</i>

23:54.280 --> 23:55.645
<i>You better run, boy.</i>

23:55.800 --> 23:57.325
<i>You're going to die, man!</i>

23:57.520 --> 24:00.683
<i>Come on, let's get him!
You're dead, fat pig!</i>

24:08.080 --> 24:10.560
<i>Hey, what's this?</i>

24:10.800 --> 24:12.802
<i>Looks like
a geek wading pool to me.</i>

24:18.800 --> 24:20.768
So what are you two girls
doing down here?

24:20.920 --> 24:24.322
Hey, look at the dam,
a stupid little baby dam.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.961
You didn't have to do that.
Why did you do that?

24:32.120 --> 24:34.009
'Cause I felt like it. Give me that.

24:34.200 --> 24:37.170
- That's for my asthma.
- Oh, is that a fact, sissy?

24:40.040 --> 24:42.566
- Leave him alone.
- Shut up, you little creep.

24:44.640 --> 24:47.246
I said stop that,

24:47.400 --> 24:50.927
<i>or I'll pull your ears down
and tie them underneath your chin.</i>

24:51.400 --> 24:53.448
- You seen a fat kid run by here?
- No.

24:53.600 --> 24:56.046
<i>Big, fat kid, all messed up.
No.</i>

24:56.200 --> 24:59.249
<i>You sure, mush-mouth?
You better be sure.</i>

24:59.400 --> 25:00.970
<i>I'm sure.</i>

25:01.760 --> 25:02.761
Let's go.

25:04.640 --> 25:07.291
Ta-ta, girls.

25:15.080 --> 25:16.491
Oh, no.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.611
It's empty-

25:23.160 --> 25:25.162
I can't breathe.

25:27.440 --> 25:28.771
Are they gone?

25:29.760 --> 25:32.411
Yes. Look, can you stay here
with my friend

25:32.560 --> 25:34.130
while I go get his medicine?

25:34.440 --> 25:35.441
Yeah.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.011
Here. Eddie, it's okay.

25:38.360 --> 25:39.646
Take it easy, kid. You'll be okay.

25:41.360 --> 25:43.522
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah?

25:43.840 --> 25:46.923
What are we gonna do if...
They come back?

25:53.280 --> 25:54.361
Want some?

25:59.800 --> 26:02.804
- My dad, he died of the big "C".
- "The big 'C'"?

26:02.960 --> 26:05.440
Cancer. I was just a little kid.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.843
Yeah, my dad died, too.
He was shot down in Korea.

26:09.040 --> 26:13.489
- Remember him much?
- Sort of, I think.

26:15.480 --> 26:17.608
- So, who's the other guy?
- Bill?

26:17.800 --> 26:21.600
Bill's my best friend.
He's a really great guy.

26:22.480 --> 26:23.481
<i>Hey!</i>

26:24.080 --> 26:25.081
I'm

26:25.840 --> 26:26.841
back.

26:28.760 --> 26:31.843
- Does he always stutter that much?
- It's worse since his kid brother died.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.365
Some guy killed George.

26:33.520 --> 26:36.251
Pulled one of his arms right off,
just like a wing off a fly.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.481
That's awful.

26:37.640 --> 26:40.166
I just told you because
if you want Bill to be your friend,

26:40.320 --> 26:42.129
it's better not to talk to him
about George.

26:42.280 --> 26:45.204
- He's all messed up about it.
- Man, I would be, too.

26:45.680 --> 26:48.843
"Would be, too," what?
- Oh, nothing. Thanks.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.041
Yeah.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.281
Thanks for staying.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.885
Jeez. He's really got it bad.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.442
I was scared he's going to
slip into a coma like on <i>Dr. Kildare.</i>

26:56.600 --> 27:01.731
- Me, too. You're Ben.
- Yeah, and you're Bill.

27:01.880 --> 27:06.602
- Yeah, and this is...
- Eddie. He knows.

27:06.760 --> 27:09.604
I hate it when you stutter my name, Bill.
You sound like Elmer Fudd.

27:09.760 --> 27:10.807
Sorry.

27:10.960 --> 27:14.601
No, no, no. No, Elmer Fudd has a lisp.
It's Porky Pig that stutters.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.285
Okay, Okay-

27:16.480 --> 27:18.562
- Why don't you come back tomorrow?
- Yeah.

27:19.040 --> 27:22.408
Me and Eddie, we're trying to make a dam.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.405
Well, you gotta have some boards.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.881
You get boards and you put them in a row,
facing each other.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.890
Like the bread of a sandwich and then...
But we...

27:30.360 --> 27:31.566
Huh?

27:32.040 --> 27:34.725
- But we do it.
- Oh, yeah, "we."

27:54.640 --> 27:57.086
- What are you doing, coz?
- Just something for school.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.287
Let's see.

27:58.600 --> 28:01.126
- Ooh. A poem.
- That's private.

28:01.440 --> 28:02.930
"Your hair is winter fire.

28:03.320 --> 28:05.129
"January embers."

28:05.440 --> 28:07.363
Hey, Mom, listen to this, Benny's in love!

28:07.520 --> 28:08.567
Give this back.

28:08.920 --> 28:12.367
Oh, Mom! Mom!
- Stop that! Benjamin!

28:12.520 --> 28:16.445
Hanscom, stop that immediately,
you young ruffian!

28:16.600 --> 28:17.601
I hate you!

28:17.800 --> 28:20.804
You're only here because
Mom says it's our Christian duty.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.641
<i>Nobody's ever going to say
a sister of mine is on welfare.</i>

28:28.800 --> 28:31.007
So you're welcome here
as long as you need to stay.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.481
But I have to say
you're spoiling the boy, Arlene.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.483
You need a firm hand, discipline.

28:47.640 --> 28:50.086
We'll have a home of our own
one day, Benny. I promise.

28:50.240 --> 28:51.571
I know, Mama.

28:52.080 --> 28:55.801
Benny, as long as we're guests
in this house, I need you to help me.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.851
They wouldn't treat us like this
if Daddy were still alive.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.331
Come on inside now and apologize.

29:00.480 --> 29:01.811
Apologize? But he was...

29:01.960 --> 29:06.090
- Benny, you must!
- No! I hate it here. I hate it here.

29:06.240 --> 29:07.765
Benny, come on. Benny.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.845
<i>Benny!</i>

29:31.440 --> 29:34.250
<i>Ben! Benny! Up here, Ben.</i>

29:34.880 --> 29:35.881
Daddy?

29:36.960 --> 29:37.961
<i>Benny!</i>

29:41.080 --> 29:42.081
<i>Ben!</i>

29:44.120 --> 29:45.121
<i>Ben!</i>

29:46.880 --> 29:47.881
<i>Hi, Ben.</i>

29:53.440 --> 29:54.487
Daddy?

29:55.840 --> 29:57.808
That's my home now, son.

30:00.600 --> 30:02.125
Do you want a balloon, Ben?

30:03.720 --> 30:05.290
They float.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.241
They all float.

30:08.560 --> 30:11.370
Come here, son. You'll like it down there.

30:12.080 --> 30:13.366
You'll never have to grow up.

30:29.800 --> 30:31.609
They float.

30:31.760 --> 30:33.808
They all float.

30:33.960 --> 30:36.247
And when you're down here with me,

30:36.520 --> 30:40.605
<i>fat boy, you'll float, too.</i>

30:48.800 --> 30:50.040
Please.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.242
Please, stop.

31:01.600 --> 31:04.570
Beverly By Hand. One moment, please.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.805
Miss Marsh's office.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.323
Hold a moment, please.

31:19.480 --> 31:21.642
Bev, someone calling from Maine,
says it's important.

31:21.800 --> 31:22.801
Maine?

31:22.960 --> 31:26.043
- Pam, I said no calls until...
- We've got a minute. I'll take it.

31:26.320 --> 31:29.051
No. Get their number and close the door.

31:43.480 --> 31:45.209
Your hands are shaking.

31:45.760 --> 31:47.171
I'm scared to death, Tom.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.289
That stuff spreads like cancer.
I won't have it around.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.081
Ah.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.687
There. That's perfect. Don't touch it.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.041
Listen to me, Bevy.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.962
We've got a bunch
of well-heeled Japanese gentlemen

32:01.120 --> 32:02.565
waiting for us downstairs.

32:02.960 --> 32:04.007
We're gonna show 'em around.

32:04.160 --> 32:06.891
You're gonna play
the charming flamboyant designer.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.405
We're gonna sit down, make a deal,

32:08.560 --> 32:11.166
I'm gonna play hardball,
and when it's over, we're gonna be rich.

32:11.720 --> 32:14.371
If you get a hold of yourself right now.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.965
- Do you understand?
- Mmm-hmm.

32:16.680 --> 32:18.205
Okay. Kiss for good luck?

32:25.400 --> 32:26.447
Okay, let's go.

32:26.600 --> 32:30.321
And Bevy, don't ever contradict me
in front of Pam again, okay?

32:31.840 --> 32:32.841
Okay.

32:53.800 --> 32:56.167
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I'm Beverly Marsh.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.243
This is my partner, Tom Rogan.

33:34.720 --> 33:37.451
Hello?
<i>Beverly, it's Mike Hanlon.</i>

33:37.680 --> 33:39.921
- Who?
<i>- Mike Hanlon- Remember me?</i>

33:40.120 --> 33:43.761
Mike Hanlon. Of course I remember.
How are you?

33:43.920 --> 33:45.729
<i>Fine. Look, are you sitting down?</i>

33:52.120 --> 33:53.485
There you are.

33:58.280 --> 33:59.327
Whoa.

34:08.880 --> 34:10.211
Who was on the phone?

34:18.400 --> 34:20.801
I know you're going to think
this is crazy...

34:20.960 --> 34:22.724
I certainly think it's crazy,

34:22.880 --> 34:24.484
but I've gotta go to Maine.

34:25.160 --> 34:26.764
It's... It's hard to explain. Um...

34:27.320 --> 34:30.449
That was Mike Hanlon on the phone.
You remember the call at work today?

34:30.600 --> 34:32.364
He's an old, dear friend. I have to...

34:32.520 --> 34:35.251
Shut up! That's what you have to do,
just shut up!

34:35.400 --> 34:37.482
The very day I make a deal
of a lifetime for you,

34:37.640 --> 34:39.768
<i>you wanna run off to Maine
with some old boyfriend?</i>

34:40.040 --> 34:41.849
What do you take me for?

34:42.440 --> 34:44.727
Oh, boy. I've seen this coming.

34:45.200 --> 34:48.443
Oh, yes. You've forgotten
your manners, little girl.

34:48.840 --> 34:51.844
Contradicting me here,
smarting off there, and now this.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.522
You've forgotten your lessons, Bevy.

34:57.680 --> 34:59.762
It's been too long since last time.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.770
Put that thing down.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.522
I have to get out to O'Hare
as fast as I can.

35:05.760 --> 35:09.207
There's some trouble,
some very bad trouble.

35:09.480 --> 35:13.849
<i>It's come back, Beverly.
It's come back. Remember your promise.</i>

35:14.520 --> 35:16.522
- Put these clothes back.
- No.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.523
- You get into bed!
- No!

35:19.280 --> 35:20.884
Then maybe you can
leave this house in two days...

35:21.040 --> 35:22.849
- No!
- ...instead of two weeks.

35:23.000 --> 35:26.766
Not ever, ever, ever again!

35:36.560 --> 35:40.326
Listen to me. If you ever come
near me again, I will kill you.

35:40.480 --> 35:44.201
Do you understand? I will kill you.

35:46.080 --> 35:47.844
Bev, you need me!

35:48.200 --> 35:49.725
Bev!

36:03.800 --> 36:04.926
O'Hare, please.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.241
What airline, miss?

36:07.560 --> 36:09.562
Uh...

36:10.240 --> 36:12.083
I, uh, I need to go to Maine.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.925
All right. We'll find one
that goes to Maine.

36:15.080 --> 36:16.809
What's in Maine? Family?

36:17.640 --> 36:19.130
Friends.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.764
The best I ever had.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.284
Daddy, breakfast is ready.

36:26.040 --> 36:27.280
I'll get it.

36:51.240 --> 36:52.969
"Your hair is winter fire.

36:54.320 --> 36:55.651
"January embers.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.768
"My heart burns there, too."

36:58.920 --> 37:00.649
Who was that at the door, Bevy?

37:01.360 --> 37:02.805
- What do you got there?
- Nothing.

37:02.960 --> 37:03.961
Let me see that.

37:07.800 --> 37:09.086
You been doing something you shouldn't?

37:10.400 --> 37:13.609
You been fooling around with some boy?
Poetry from some boy?

37:16.960 --> 37:18.564
I worry about you a lot, Bevy.

37:18.840 --> 37:21.320
- Sometimes, I worry a lot.
- Daddy, please.

37:22.160 --> 37:25.528
Not even 12
and already running with some boy.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.324
Let me alone, you just let me alone!

37:27.480 --> 37:28.481
Come here!

37:29.440 --> 37:32.683
Don't make me go over there
and collect you. You come to me.

37:32.840 --> 37:33.841
No.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.810
- What did you say?
- I said no!

37:41.680 --> 37:43.887
You get right the hell back here, Bevy!

37:44.080 --> 37:47.402
And in front of God,
I'll whip the skin off of you!

38:04.320 --> 38:05.321
<i>Hi.</i>

38:07.040 --> 38:09.361
I'm sorry if I scared you. Are you okay?

38:09.920 --> 38:10.967
Yeah.

38:16.560 --> 38:19.564
Haven't you got anything better to do
than go sneaking up on people?

38:22.120 --> 38:24.851
- Sorry.
- You should be.

38:26.120 --> 38:28.805
Well, I was thinking,
it being Saturday and all,

38:28.960 --> 38:30.803
and if you didn't have
anything better to do,

38:30.960 --> 38:32.883
you could come down with me
to the barrens.

38:34.200 --> 38:35.531
The barrens?

38:37.280 --> 38:38.645
This is Eddie,

38:39.240 --> 38:40.765
<i>and this is Bill.</i>

38:43.400 --> 38:44.526
Hi.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.605
Hi.

38:49.560 --> 38:51.562
Do you guys know each other already?

38:54.920 --> 38:58.891
Well, Bev wants to help. I hope it's okay.
I mean, she's a girl.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.241
Sure.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.525
Hey, what's this? By George, Martha,

39:05.680 --> 39:07.409
it's the river Nile.

39:07.600 --> 39:10.285
And four, count them, four sphinxes.

39:10.720 --> 39:11.721
Richie.

39:12.280 --> 39:13.884
You were expecting maybe Gunga Din?

39:14.440 --> 39:17.250
That's Richie. He can drive you
to the bughouse and back, but he's okay.

39:17.440 --> 39:21.604
I heard that, you skirt. Hi, Bill.
How you doin', Eddie Spaghetti?

39:22.080 --> 39:25.607
Don't do that. I hate it when you do that.
And don't call me "Eddie Spaghetti."

39:26.000 --> 39:28.526
Oh, you love it, Eddie.
It's what makes you so chuck-a-licious.

39:28.720 --> 39:29.721
Richie Tozier's my name.

39:32.280 --> 39:35.568
And doing voices is my game.
This is Stan "the Man" Uris.

39:35.720 --> 39:38.485
Stannie's a Jew, which means
he's really smart and says <i>"oy"</i> a lot.

39:38.640 --> 39:41.803
Richie's got a high metabolism,
and it tends to make him hyperactive.

39:42.160 --> 39:45.050
So you, um, Haystack,
what, are you building a dam or something?

39:45.200 --> 39:46.247
Yeah.

39:46.440 --> 39:48.204
- You ever built one before?
- No.

39:48.600 --> 39:49.647
How do you know it'll work?

39:50.120 --> 39:52.646
- Well, of course it will. Why wouldn't it?
- Yeah, but how do you know?

39:52.800 --> 39:53.801
I just know.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.803
- Yeah, he just knows.
- Yeah.

39:55.960 --> 39:57.041
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:57.360 --> 39:58.361
Well,okay.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.367
- You're a genius, Haystack.
- Oh, it's not so much.

40:30.520 --> 40:33.205
- Yes, it is. It's great.
- We stopped that sucker cold!

40:33.360 --> 40:34.361
- Yeah.
- It's great.

40:34.520 --> 40:36.727
We could flood out the whole barrens
if we wanted to.

40:36.880 --> 40:38.769
We did it! We!

40:38.920 --> 40:40.843
- Yes!
- Yeah! Yeah!

40:46.520 --> 40:48.682
Listen, I'll go this way.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.606
- See you later, alligator.
- After a while, crocodile.

40:55.040 --> 40:57.725
- See you, Ben.
- Yeah, see you, Bill.

40:58.560 --> 41:01.450
Hi yo, Silver. Away!

41:04.160 --> 41:05.571
See you, Beverly.

41:05.760 --> 41:06.886
See you.

41:17.720 --> 41:19.404
My heart burns there, too.

41:29.440 --> 41:33.843
77 Sunset Strip <i>will continue
following station identification.</i>

41:39.920 --> 41:41.331
<i>Help me.</i>

41:42.400 --> 41:44.607
<i>Help me, please.</i>

41:46.960 --> 41:48.166
<i>Help me.</i>

41:50.240 --> 41:52.641
<i>- Help me, Beverly.</i>
- Hello?

41:54.440 --> 41:55.441
Is someone there?

41:55.920 --> 41:59.811
<i>The clown brought us down here.
We all float.</i>

41:59.960 --> 42:01.007
Who are you?

42:01.440 --> 42:04.410
<i>I'm Vickie Burrows.
I'm Matthew O'Connor.</i>

42:04.720 --> 42:07.246
<i>We're all the dead kids.</i>

42:09.280 --> 42:13.001
<i>Come closer, Beverly.
We all want to meet you.</i>

42:13.280 --> 42:14.645
<i>We float.
We float.</i>

42:22.080 --> 42:23.081
Daddy!

42:23.800 --> 42:27.441
- What in the name of heaven?
- The bathroom, Daddy, the bathroom!

42:27.920 --> 42:31.003
- Was someone peeping in at you, girl?
- The sink, in the sink!

42:34.600 --> 42:38.047
Well, what is it you think you saw?
Speak up, girl!

42:40.480 --> 42:41.527
<i>I worry about you, Bevy.</i>

42:41.800 --> 42:43.643
Sometimes I worry a lot.

42:44.800 --> 42:46.370
Now explain yourself!

42:46.520 --> 42:50.923
There was a spider.
A big, fat spider.

42:51.160 --> 42:54.403
It crawled out of the drain,
and I guess it crawled back down again.

42:55.520 --> 42:57.363
Now, these buildings are old,

42:57.520 --> 42:59.329
<i>with drains the size
of the Holland Tunnel.</i>

42:59.800 --> 43:01.484
There's nothing there now.

43:06.200 --> 43:07.326
Get to bed.

43:10.680 --> 43:13.968
<i>Say hello to your friends, Beverly.</i>

43:15.680 --> 43:18.126
<i>You'll die if you try to fight us.</i>

43:19.960 --> 43:22.327
<i>You'll die if you try.</i>

43:22.920 --> 43:26.845
<i>You'll die
if you try to fight us, Beverly.</i>

43:27.360 --> 43:33.527
<i>You'll die if you try.</i>

43:34.200 --> 43:37.249
<i>You'll die if you try.</i>

43:37.520 --> 43:40.603
<i>You'll die if you try.</i>

43:41.040 --> 43:44.362
<i>You'll die if you try.</i>

43:53.760 --> 43:55.410
<i>Eddie!</i>

43:55.560 --> 43:57.403
<i>Eddie, where are you?</i>

44:00.120 --> 44:01.770
<i>Eddie?</i>

44:04.840 --> 44:08.208
<i>- Eddie, where are you?</i>
- I'm in here, Ma.

44:12.240 --> 44:13.241
Eddie.

44:13.960 --> 44:14.961
Ah.

44:16.560 --> 44:19.291
Where... Where are you going?

44:19.560 --> 44:21.050
I have to go away for a while.

44:21.200 --> 44:23.567
"Away"? Where?

44:24.240 --> 44:27.403
Eddie, this isn't like you.
Tell me where you're going.

44:27.600 --> 44:28.886
Eddie, stop!

44:30.040 --> 44:32.486
You're in trouble, aren't you?

44:32.920 --> 44:33.921
Eddie?

44:34.840 --> 44:38.242
Tell me who was on the phone. Answer me.

44:38.760 --> 44:39.966
Answer me.

44:40.440 --> 44:42.681
Mom, please, please. Don't cry, okay?

44:42.840 --> 44:46.128
Eddie, you're scaring me so bad,
you've got to tell me.

44:47.240 --> 44:48.241
Eddie.

44:49.800 --> 44:50.801
Eddie.

44:51.000 --> 44:54.322
- Where are you going? Derry?
- I've gotta go back to Derry.

44:55.440 --> 44:58.125
Why would you want to go back
to that dirty little town?

44:58.280 --> 45:01.284
There's nothing for you there.
There never was, Eddie.

45:02.800 --> 45:05.451
Please, Ma. Please.

45:08.280 --> 45:09.281
Eddie!

45:11.240 --> 45:14.244
- Let's get out of here.
- Jeez, Eddie.

45:14.640 --> 45:15.687
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

45:15.840 --> 45:17.888
- You look like you've seen a ghost.
- Move it!

45:19.640 --> 45:21.210
<i>Eddie!</i>

45:28.280 --> 45:30.647
Joey, I'm sorry
to be leaving you holding the bag.

45:30.800 --> 45:32.484
Do we have enough drivers
lined up for next week?

45:32.640 --> 45:33.641
It's covered, Eddie.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.280
All right, I want you to do
the Pacino job yourself.

45:36.440 --> 45:38.204
Remember, he likes the Lincoln stretch.

45:38.400 --> 45:40.562
I know, Eddie.
The business is under control.

45:40.720 --> 45:41.801
Great.

45:41.960 --> 45:45.089
It's you I'm worried about. Yeah?
I'm fine.

45:45.240 --> 45:46.480
So where are we going?

45:47.160 --> 45:50.562
30 to Boston.

46:58.640 --> 46:59.687
They saw me.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.529
- We... We better go.
- I'm a dead man.

47:03.680 --> 47:06.411
If I were you guys,
I wouldn't pay to see a monster movie,

47:06.560 --> 47:07.846
I'd just stay home and look in a mirror.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.081
Richie!

47:21.680 --> 47:23.125
Let's get out of here!

47:23.280 --> 47:24.611
Yeah, let's go!

47:26.320 --> 47:29.369
Oh, did you see those guys?
I saw you make it worse.

47:29.520 --> 47:31.443
Oh, come on, Eddie Spaghetti.

47:31.600 --> 47:34.888
It was just a joke.
Sometimes you joke too much.

47:35.080 --> 47:37.651
Yeah, well, sometimes you gotta
make jokes, or you die of boredom.

47:37.800 --> 47:41.168
I mean, are we men or are we mice?
We're mice!

47:41.320 --> 47:43.288
Then let's act like mice.

47:43.560 --> 47:44.561
Oh, look.

47:50.520 --> 47:53.763
That place scares me green.
I think it's haunted.

47:54.120 --> 47:57.363
Honestly, Eddie, such things
just aren't empirically possible.

47:57.560 --> 47:59.369
In English, ain't no such thing.

47:59.560 --> 48:03.201
You know, you're a pretty swift guy
for a girl, my little chickadee.

48:03.400 --> 48:07.325
Why, Richie Tozier, was that a compliment?
On our very first date?

48:07.720 --> 48:08.960
On...

48:09.240 --> 48:10.810
How come Richie's so special?

48:10.960 --> 48:14.043
Well, the date wasn't just with him,
Eddie dear. I love you, too.

48:14.480 --> 48:15.845
- Ooh.
- Ew.

48:29.480 --> 48:31.482
Hey, don't trip!

48:31.840 --> 48:33.330
Whoa!

48:43.000 --> 48:47.767
You know, Eddie,
it's been great, but see you later.

48:47.960 --> 48:49.610
See you later.
Bye, Eddie.

48:52.160 --> 48:55.243
I wish this summer would never end.
It's the best summer of my whole life.

48:55.400 --> 48:56.845
Eddie.

48:57.440 --> 48:59.408
Eddie Kaspbrak,

49:00.240 --> 49:03.164
I was worried sick.
I almost called the police.

49:03.320 --> 49:05.607
Eddie was with us, Mrs...
- Go away.

49:06.320 --> 49:07.367
<i>Go home.</i>

49:07.680 --> 49:09.444
Ma, these are my friends.

49:09.600 --> 49:12.524
- See you tomorrow, Eddie.
- Eddie has to rest tomorrow.

49:18.040 --> 49:20.884
I don't want you to play with them
anymore. No good will come of it.

49:21.040 --> 49:22.041
But, Ma, they're my friends.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.965
You don't need any friends, Eddie,
except for your own ma.

49:25.120 --> 49:27.043
<i>You feel warm.
I'm fine.</i>

49:27.200 --> 49:30.568
<i>No gym and no showers
with the other boys this week.</i>

49:30.720 --> 49:32.563
<i>I don't want you catching their germs.</i>

49:33.960 --> 49:38.010
All right, you guys, quit that running,
this is a hallway, not a track! Come on!

49:42.200 --> 49:45.170
- Did you take a shower, Kaspbrak?
- No, sir.

49:45.560 --> 49:48.609
Now look, I'm gonna explain this to you
only one more time.

49:48.760 --> 49:52.242
You take phys ed, you sweat,
you take a shower. Got it?

51:06.640 --> 51:08.290
<i>It's okay, Eddie.</i>

51:08.760 --> 51:12.048
<i>Hi. I just wanted to say hello.</i>

51:13.360 --> 51:17.046
Hot enough for you up there, is it?

51:20.000 --> 51:23.004
This is a little inconvenient, Eddie.

51:23.360 --> 51:26.091
<i>Just hold on
while I make a few adjustments.</i>

51:31.200 --> 51:32.690
Here I am, wheezy.

51:34.520 --> 51:37.729
Hey. You're gonna like it down here.

51:42.240 --> 51:45.130
Won't do any good to run, girly boy.

51:47.440 --> 51:51.411
See you in your dreams.
Oh, come back anytime.

51:51.560 --> 51:53.210
Bring your friends.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.645
<i>So I say, "Go ahead,</i>

52:34.920 --> 52:36.729
<i>"make my day."</i>

52:37.000 --> 52:40.402
<i>And the next thing you know,
I'm feeling my way to the toilet.</i>

52:40.560 --> 52:42.961
<i>I mean, how much power
does the electric company have, huh?</i>

52:43.120 --> 52:45.043
<i>How much power does the electric company...</i>

52:45.200 --> 52:46.247
<i>Remember Godzilla?</i>

52:46.400 --> 52:48.926
<i>I mean, a plane couldn't stop him,
the atom bomb couldn't stop him,</i>

52:49.080 --> 52:51.686
<i>hell, Nancy Reagan couldn't stop him.</i>

52:51.840 --> 52:54.764
<i>But you get him in front of
one high power line...</i>

52:56.560 --> 52:59.370
<i>Look, look!
The creature is attacking the city.</i>

53:10.720 --> 53:13.121
You guys are great!
Good night! Good night!

53:13.280 --> 53:14.281
Bobby!

53:14.760 --> 53:17.047
Hey, hey, guys!

53:19.560 --> 53:20.686
Thank you!

53:21.000 --> 53:22.001
Beautiful!

53:22.160 --> 53:24.401
I don't know. That
political material is getting real old.

53:24.560 --> 53:27.689
Who the hell knows Betty Ford?
We've got to work on this, man.

53:27.840 --> 53:31.561
We've got to work on...
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on. Oh.

53:31.960 --> 53:35.487
There she is. Hey.
How's my favorite niece?

53:35.920 --> 53:38.491
I'm so glad you made it.
I want to see Miller first thing Monday.

53:38.640 --> 53:39.801
First thing Monday,
I want to see Miller, okay?

53:39.960 --> 53:41.007
I've got it arranged.
- Okay?

53:41.160 --> 53:43.288
If I'm host...
Listen. If I'm hosting next week,

53:43.480 --> 53:44.891
I've got to have that new material.

53:45.080 --> 53:46.650
I've got somebody you've got to meet.

53:46.800 --> 53:48.802
- I can't tell you... Okay.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

53:49.120 --> 53:50.645
<i>Buona sera.</i>

53:50.960 --> 53:52.724
Yeah, this is Richie Tozier.
Who's this, Elvis?

53:52.880 --> 53:54.325
<i>Mike Han/on.</i>
- Who?

53:55.680 --> 53:56.761
Who?

53:56.960 --> 53:59.486
<i>Mike Hanlon, from Derry. Do you remember?</i>

54:00.640 --> 54:03.291
Yeah. Sure, I remember you, pally.

54:04.160 --> 54:06.481
What about subbing for Carson
on Monday night?

54:06.680 --> 54:08.842
Who's going to sit behind the desk
and make funny?

54:09.000 --> 54:11.446
Let Leno do it, I don't care.
- Richie!

54:11.640 --> 54:12.687
What am I going to tell them?

54:12.840 --> 54:15.969
You tell 'em whatever you have
to tell 'em, Nat! I need a couple of days.

54:16.120 --> 54:17.360
Couple of days for what?

54:17.560 --> 54:20.245
The reunion of your Cub Scout pack
at Grover's Corners?

54:20.440 --> 54:23.284
Come on, boychik, what is it?

54:23.960 --> 54:26.645
A broad? The mob?

54:28.000 --> 54:29.604
I don't know what it is.

54:31.000 --> 54:32.843
Now, don't insult my intelligence.

54:33.320 --> 54:34.526
I made a promise.

54:34.800 --> 54:37.007
We've been through a lot together, Rich.

54:49.920 --> 54:53.003
You're doing fine. You can handle this.

54:56.240 --> 54:58.481
<i>No, this can't be happening!</i>

55:00.560 --> 55:01.721
Help!

55:01.880 --> 55:03.962
Oh, God. Help!

55:04.880 --> 55:07.531
<i>Help! Help!</i>

55:19.760 --> 55:23.048
<i>They felt its breath,
hot and horrible, against their faces.</i>

55:23.200 --> 55:26.807
<i>But at that moment, they released
the stones and ran out of the cave.</i>

55:26.960 --> 55:28.769
<i>And now, they were back home,</i>

55:28.920 --> 55:30.843
but nothing could change
the way they felt.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.128
They had learned to be strong together.

55:33.280 --> 55:35.601
They had beaten the dragon
with their magic stones,

55:35.760 --> 55:37.285
and nothing would ever be the same again.

55:39.080 --> 55:42.243
You gotta write that one down, Bill.
That's my favorite.

55:42.440 --> 55:44.966
- Really excellent.
- Beautiful.

55:45.120 --> 55:49.284
Yeah, Bill's going to leave
this one-horse town and meet Sandra Dee

55:49.440 --> 55:51.966
and all the other babes in Hollywood.

55:52.320 --> 55:56.120
Dream on, Richie.
I'm not sure I want to grow up at all.

55:56.800 --> 55:59.770
Well, I do. I want to be
a train conductor and see the world.

56:00.000 --> 56:02.731
That is if your mom
ever lets you cross the street.

56:02.920 --> 56:05.400
I want to be
the first rock 'n' roll singer from Derry.

56:05.560 --> 56:06.800
Either that or an impressionist.

56:06.960 --> 56:08.644
Your voices all sound the same, Richie.

56:08.880 --> 56:10.450
Thanks a bunch, professor.

56:10.800 --> 56:12.768
- How about you, Bev?
- A painter, maybe.

56:12.920 --> 56:14.809
My dad's been teaching me how to draw.

56:15.280 --> 56:17.851
Fighter pilot. When I'm old enough,
I'm gonna join the Air Force.

56:18.000 --> 56:19.570
An ornithologist.

56:19.720 --> 56:22.121
I like cataloging things
and finding their logical order.

56:22.280 --> 56:24.123
Can I tell you guys something?

56:26.040 --> 56:27.644
If you guys laugh, I'll never...

56:27.880 --> 56:28.961
We won't, will We?

56:29.120 --> 56:30.121
No.

56:34.960 --> 56:37.486
The other night, in Georgie's room...

56:37.640 --> 56:40.291
<i>What on earth? For the love of Mike!</i>

56:40.440 --> 56:43.444
Look at this mess. The saints preserve us.

56:48.840 --> 56:50.126
Officer Nell.

56:50.280 --> 56:53.841
Don't "Officer Nell" me. You're fixing
to back flood all the drains in town

56:54.000 --> 56:57.766
- Whose brainstorm was this, eh?
- I showed them how, it's my fault.

56:57.920 --> 56:59.285
It was my idea.

56:59.440 --> 57:00.726
- Me, too.
- Yeah, I was in on it, too.

57:00.880 --> 57:01.881
And me.

57:02.040 --> 57:05.010
- I suppose it was your idea, too, lass?
- Yes.

57:05.160 --> 57:07.845
Now listen to me, all of you.
There's been another murder.

57:08.640 --> 57:11.007
- Little Velma Daniels.
- Velma Daniels?

57:11.160 --> 57:13.766
Her poor body was found this morning
down by the canal.

57:13.920 --> 57:15.001
So, if you come down here to play,

57:15.200 --> 57:17.168
come together like you are now.
Understand?

57:18.960 --> 57:21.361
That means together, all the time.

57:23.760 --> 57:24.841
Your hands on it?

57:35.880 --> 57:38.326
So what do you think
Bill was going to tell us yesterday?

57:38.720 --> 57:41.803
I don't know.
He's been acting awful moody lately.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.001
In fact, they all have.

57:44.320 --> 57:46.402
Of course, with this food,
who can blame them?

57:50.600 --> 57:51.601
Well, hey.

57:52.280 --> 57:54.647
- Larry, Curly and Moe.
- Beep, beep, Richie!

57:54.800 --> 57:57.041
All right, twerp. Who threw it, huh?

57:57.240 --> 57:59.368
Was it you? it was you, wasn't it?

58:00.560 --> 58:03.769
Tell me. And you might live
through this, four-eyes.

58:04.440 --> 58:06.522
At the Paramount theater, who did it?

58:29.600 --> 58:30.886
Hey, way to go, banana-heels.

58:36.080 --> 58:37.081
Tozier!

58:38.320 --> 58:39.321
Bowers!

58:43.680 --> 58:46.968
Go downstairs and get a mop
from Mr. Marsh and clean this up!

58:48.400 --> 58:49.401
Go on!

58:57.480 --> 58:58.481
Mr. Marsh?

59:01.040 --> 59:02.121
Mr. Marsh?

59:03.280 --> 59:05.169
Great. Just great.

59:05.920 --> 59:09.527
Yoo-hoo. Mr. Marsh, you down here?

59:10.760 --> 59:12.728
Probably drunk as a skunk.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.286
Mr. Marsh?

59:20.280 --> 59:21.361
<i>Mr. Marsh?</i>

59:37.680 --> 59:38.841
Uh, Mr. Marsh,

59:41.680 --> 59:43.364
I had a little accident in the cafeteria.

59:51.480 --> 59:54.450
No, this... This isn't happening.

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:01.001
Help!

1:00:01.440 --> 1:00:03.681
Oh, God, help!

1:00:13.640 --> 1:00:15.130
"Beep, beep, Richie"!

1:00:16.880 --> 1:00:18.405
Come back, anytime!

1:00:20.440 --> 1:00:24.684
I'll show you how to float down here.

1:00:25.240 --> 1:00:29.131
They all float down here.

1:00:34.400 --> 1:00:35.401
<i>Help!</i>

1:00:36.800 --> 1:00:39.280
You've got to help me. Somebody, please.

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.685
In the basement, there's a werewolf.

1:01:14.360 --> 1:01:15.646
Stop him.

1:01:36.760 --> 1:01:38.330
<i>I remember the day
I took that photo,</i>

1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:40.284
<i>one of the best days of my life.</i>

1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:42.285
<i>We were lucky that summer,</i>

1:01:42.440 --> 1:01:44.966
<i>lucky we didn't get
our fool selves killed.</i>

1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:47.691
<i>Or maybe there was something
more than luck at work.</i>

1:01:47.840 --> 1:01:51.003
<i>If so, I hope it returns when they do.</i>

1:01:56.080 --> 1:01:57.241
Lucky seven.

1:02:02.560 --> 1:02:04.449
<i>I brought this
old photo album from home.</i>

1:02:04.600 --> 1:02:07.046
My dad was stationed in Derry
during World War II,

1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:10.562
and he started collecting these old photos
that go way back to the olden days.

1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:12.290
Who'd want a history of this toilet?

1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:15.523
Henry, how many years
will you be in here with me?

1:02:16.680 --> 1:02:17.920
<i>Continue, Michael.</i>

1:02:18.080 --> 1:02:19.764
This is the old ironworks.

1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:23.009
One Sunday, back in 1930,
there was an Easter egg hunt here.

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:27.004
But the ironworks exploded
and all these people got killed.

1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:32.122
<i>This is the Derry Standpipe.
It supplied all the water to the town</i>

1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:34.687
<i>until a big disaster back in 1900.</i>

1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:39.405
Maybe the biggest mystery
is how 253 settlers

1:02:39.560 --> 1:02:41.369
just disappeared without a trace.

1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:47.211
Thank you, Michael, for that illuminating,
if somewhat morbid, history.

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:49.206
Now, who's next?

1:02:55.120 --> 1:02:56.121
Howdy, partner.

1:02:58.360 --> 1:02:59.930
- Give it here.
- "Give it here."

1:03:02.200 --> 1:03:04.282
Or what, boy? Or what?

1:03:05.920 --> 1:03:10.209
The nigger here lives down the street
from me and my daddy, isn't that so?

1:03:10.360 --> 1:03:11.441
Give it here.

1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:17.283
You've been giving me and my daddy
grief for a long, long time.

1:03:18.800 --> 1:03:20.131
You like fireworks, boy?

1:03:20.400 --> 1:03:21.401
Huh?

1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:25.605
What do you say
to a rocket in your pocket?

1:03:30.600 --> 1:03:31.681
Hey, you!

1:03:32.200 --> 1:03:33.247
Stop that right now.

1:03:34.560 --> 1:03:35.561
Get him!

1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:42.520
<i>I'm just glad I'm not
the only one who saw something.</i>

1:03:42.680 --> 1:03:45.251
It wasn't a clown at first.
It was a werewolf.

1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:47.880
I didn't see a werewolf.
Just a clown.

1:03:48.280 --> 1:03:50.203
Don't you see

1:03:50.400 --> 1:03:54.724
it was a werewolf for Richie
because he saw that dumb movie.

1:03:54.880 --> 1:03:56.609
But it was a clown underneath.

1:03:56.760 --> 1:03:59.843
So, maybe it's some kind of evil being
that can read our minds

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.571
and take the shape of stuff
we're afraid of.

1:04:02.720 --> 1:04:04.370
And that's what happened
to all the kids around here?

1:04:04.560 --> 1:04:05.925
Pfft. Get serious.

1:04:22.760 --> 1:04:23.761
Come on, come on!

1:04:27.160 --> 1:04:28.924
Why didn't any of us say anything?

1:04:29.280 --> 1:04:31.965
Personally, I thought
you guys would think I was nuts.

1:04:32.360 --> 1:04:34.522
Me, too. I thought it was just me.

1:04:34.720 --> 1:04:35.767
You're not alone.

1:04:35.920 --> 1:04:38.321
Such a thing
just isn't empirically possible.

1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:40.404
Real. It was so real.

1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:42.489
Yeah, Stan, it almost had
my guts for garters.

1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:44.563
Probably just the influence of the movie.

1:04:44.720 --> 1:04:47.485
Couldn't it be just some crazy guy
dressed up in a clown suit?

1:04:47.640 --> 1:04:48.687
<i>No.</i>

1:04:51.240 --> 1:04:54.289
It's some kind of monster,
and it's right here in Derry.

1:04:56.720 --> 1:04:58.370
<i>I'm going to bury you!</i>

1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:00.166
God, Henry Bowers.

1:05:03.280 --> 1:05:04.327
We better get out of here.

1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:08.442
- Dummy up. All of you. Rocks.
- Rocks?

1:05:08.600 --> 1:05:10.329
Rocks. Ammo.

1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:28.370
Help me. Please, help me.

1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:35.681
You're dead!

1:05:44.520 --> 1:05:45.965
Well, what do you know?

1:05:46.400 --> 1:05:48.607
It's the fat boy, the Jew and the sissy.

1:05:49.040 --> 1:05:51.088
<i>Four-eyes and the patch girl, too.</i>

1:05:51.640 --> 1:05:53.085
<i>Nigger, you know how to pick them.</i>

1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:56.043
The loser's club.

1:05:56.240 --> 1:05:58.083
Yeah, yeah, the loser's club.

1:06:03.160 --> 1:06:05.049
I got bones to pick with you,

1:06:06.040 --> 1:06:08.202
but I'm willing to let that go for today.

1:06:08.400 --> 1:06:10.402
Today, I want him. So buzz off.

1:06:10.560 --> 1:06:11.766
Why don't you guys get out of here?

1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:15.044
- Who's going to make me?
- We are.

1:06:15.240 --> 1:06:16.241
What did you say, chubs?

1:06:16.400 --> 1:06:18.209
Hey, dig the wax
out of your ears, barf breath.

1:06:18.360 --> 1:06:20.567
You're through... Bowers.
Get out!

1:06:20.800 --> 1:06:22.882
You stuttering freak.

1:06:28.160 --> 1:06:30.731
You're going to get a surprise.
You're going to get such a surprise!

1:06:35.240 --> 1:06:36.526
Come on, Bowers!

1:06:42.960 --> 1:06:43.961
Ow!

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.445
Run, Henry!

1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:01.451
Come on!

1:07:02.880 --> 1:07:03.927
Ow!

1:07:11.080 --> 1:07:12.081
Get out.

1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:13.241
What if I won't?

1:07:13.600 --> 1:07:17.047
I think the six of us
could put you in the hospital.

1:07:17.600 --> 1:07:18.601
Seven.

1:07:26.560 --> 1:07:28.164
I'll kill you all.

1:07:28.640 --> 1:07:30.290
Get some new material, champ.

1:07:41.600 --> 1:07:43.045
I'll kill you all!

1:07:44.240 --> 1:07:45.480
I'll kill you all!

1:07:47.720 --> 1:07:48.721
Thanks.

1:07:50.280 --> 1:07:51.441
Anytime.

1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:55.330
Who are you guys anyway'?

1:07:56.760 --> 1:07:58.410
We're sort of a club.

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:03.923
Yeah, the Loser's Club.

1:08:04.400 --> 1:08:05.481
Yeah.

1:08:06.680 --> 1:08:08.603
You want in?

1:08:09.520 --> 1:08:11.488
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1:08:12.880 --> 1:08:13.927
Hey, we're seven now.

1:08:15.400 --> 1:08:16.447
Lucky seven.

1:08:17.800 --> 1:08:19.529
Hey, wait a second.

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:25.286
Camera.

1:08:36.800 --> 1:08:38.928
<i>My dad says there's no way
to date this one.</i>

1:08:39.240 --> 1:08:42.005
He says it's probably
from the early or mid-1700s,

1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:43.366
when Derry was a logging town.

1:08:43.520 --> 1:08:44.521
Hold this.

1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:48.522
Pennywise the Clown?
- That's him.

1:08:48.680 --> 1:08:49.681
That's him!

1:08:51.560 --> 1:08:53.528
Two hundred years ago? He was here then?

1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:56.160
Come on! It's just a...
It's just a drawing.

1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:57.361
Now look.

1:08:57.680 --> 1:08:59.170
Here he is again.

1:08:59.640 --> 1:09:00.846
The same man.

1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:02.281
It's not a man.

1:09:02.480 --> 1:09:03.527
It.

1:09:03.760 --> 1:09:04.807
It!

1:09:08.560 --> 1:09:10.881
That's what happened
back in Georgie's room.

1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:32.001
<i>Look!</i>

1:09:51.040 --> 1:09:52.371
I'll kill you all.

1:09:53.960 --> 1:09:57.043
I'll drive you crazy,
and I'll kill you all.

1:09:58.520 --> 1:10:03.526
I'm every nightmare you've ever had.
I'm your worst dream come true.

1:10:03.960 --> 1:10:07.806
<i>I'm everything you ever were afraid of.</i>

1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:14.521
- No.
- Yes.

1:10:14.680 --> 1:10:16.205
- Stan.
- Yes.

1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:17.441
- Yes.
- No.

1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:19.762
- Yes.
- Yes.

1:10:20.400 --> 1:10:22.164
Don't let it get to you, man.
You saw it, too.

1:10:22.360 --> 1:10:24.840
I didn't want to.
But you did.

1:10:28.440 --> 1:10:31.922
Yes. Okay. That's what you want?

1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:34.401
Yes.

1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:37.001
Yeah, yeah.
That's what I wanted, you turkey.

1:10:37.440 --> 1:10:40.489
- What are we going to do?
- "Do"? What do you mean "do"?

1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.650
I just want to forget about it.

1:10:42.840 --> 1:10:44.046
It's not just us.

1:10:44.200 --> 1:10:47.921
<i>It's all the other kids, too.
Like Velma Daniels, she was in my class.</i>

1:10:48.320 --> 1:10:49.731
Who's going to be next?

1:10:50.320 --> 1:10:52.800
Bev's right.
We've gotta do something.

1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:54.883
- We've gotta tell somebody.
- They don't see what we see.

1:10:55.040 --> 1:10:56.041
Why?

1:10:56.200 --> 1:10:58.680
When you grow up, you stop believing.

1:10:59.440 --> 1:11:01.681
They just laugh their heads off
and put us in a nuthatch.

1:11:01.840 --> 1:11:05.162
- It kills kids, damn it.
- We've gotta do something.

1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:16.807
Help me.

1:11:24.680 --> 1:11:27.081
You killed my brother, George,
you bastard.

1:11:28.560 --> 1:11:29.971
Let's see you now.

1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:32.965
Let's see you now.

1:11:33.640 --> 1:11:35.324
<i>It's scared of us, you know?</i>

1:11:36.720 --> 1:11:39.246
I can feel that. I swear to God I can.

1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:45.920
I want to kill It.

1:11:52.720 --> 1:11:53.721
Help me.

1:12:02.920 --> 1:12:04.251
Please, help me.

1:12:05.640 --> 1:12:06.641
Help me.

1:13:20.680 --> 1:13:22.489
<i>Balki. Balki, let go.</i>

1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:24.085
<i>You let go.
You let go first.</i>

1:13:24.240 --> 1:13:27.722
<i>All right, Balki.
On the count of three, we'll both let go.</i>

1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:30.082
<i>Ready?
One, two, three.</i>

1:13:35.640 --> 1:13:36.641
Oh...

1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:38.849
We got a letter from Mom today.

1:13:39.360 --> 1:13:41.567
She asked when we were going to
make her a grandma.

1:13:42.120 --> 1:13:45.169
The woman's uncanny.
I was just thinking the same thing myself.

1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:47.921
<i>Well, I was, really.</i>

1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:55.569
Does she know I'm a sex maniac
and you prefer <i>Perfect Strangers</i>, huh?

1:13:55.720 --> 1:13:58.007
You want to pay attention to me?

1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:04.046
Don't move.

1:14:08.320 --> 1:14:10.561
Uris residence. Stan speaking.
This better be good.

1:14:10.720 --> 1:14:12.848
<i>Hello, Stan. It's Mike Hanlon.</i>

1:14:13.480 --> 1:14:15.050
- Who did you say?
<i>- Mike Hanlon.</i>

1:14:15.200 --> 1:14:16.690
- Mike Hanlon?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1:14:18.520 --> 1:14:19.885
I'll be damned.

1:14:20.040 --> 1:14:22.042
<i>Stan, It's come back.</i>

1:14:23.360 --> 1:14:26.125
- Are you sure?
<i>- Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:28.971
<i>- You understand? I am sure.</i>
- No, I understand.

1:14:29.240 --> 1:14:31.004
<i>Look, I hope you know
how hard it is to call...</i>

1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:32.366
I get the picture.

1:14:32.520 --> 1:14:34.682
<i>Can you make it, Stan? Please.</i>

1:14:35.520 --> 1:14:38.729
No, I can't absolutely promise that.

1:14:38.880 --> 1:14:41.611
<i>- Don't you remember, Stan?</i>
- But I'll... I'll certainly consider it.

1:14:41.760 --> 1:14:44.286
<i>- Don't you remember your promise?</i>
- What? Yes, Mike.

1:14:44.440 --> 1:14:46.647
<i>- You promised.</i>
- Yes, I remember.

1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:48.326
<i>I hope you come.</i>

1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:50.130
- Good bye.
<i>- Bye, Stan.</i>

1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:54.164
<i>I can't even ski
in my own living room.</i>

1:14:55.400 --> 1:14:57.004
<i>This isn't going to work.</i>

1:14:57.160 --> 1:14:58.685
Who was it, honey?

1:14:58.920 --> 1:14:59.967
<i>But I'm glad.</i>

1:15:00.200 --> 1:15:02.248
<i>Now you can make a new beginning
and tell Jennifer the truth.</i>

1:15:02.440 --> 1:15:03.441
Stan?

1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:05.361
No one.

1:15:07.240 --> 1:15:08.321
No one, really.

1:15:10.240 --> 1:15:12.083
I think I'll take a bath.

1:15:13.240 --> 1:15:14.366
Now?

1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:42.247
<i>A scout is trustworthy,
loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind,</i>

1:15:42.400 --> 1:15:44.562
<i>obedient, cheerful, thrifty,</i>

1:15:44.720 --> 1:15:47.849
brave, clean and reverent.

1:15:48.960 --> 1:15:51.691
- You okay?
- I think this is crazy.

1:15:59.400 --> 1:16:02.802
One out of 10.
You're worse than I am, kiddo.

1:16:03.200 --> 1:16:05.965
At this rate, we might as well
let that damn clown take us one by one.

1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:07.321
Beep, beep, Richie.

1:16:08.080 --> 1:16:10.606
Who's left? Ben? Bev?

1:16:10.800 --> 1:16:13.121
Yeah, and one of them
better be good, Bill,

1:16:13.280 --> 1:16:15.681
'cause you're in the lead right now
with a pathetic three out of 10.

1:16:15.880 --> 1:16:17.484
Richie, will you please shut up?

1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:21.211
- You know, you don't stutter all the time.
- Ladies first.

1:16:45.360 --> 1:16:48.364
Ten out of 10.
Don't think I need to shoot.

1:16:48.800 --> 1:16:50.802
It's like it's supposed to be Bev.

1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:53.204
Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:16:53.480 --> 1:16:55.209
- Whoa.
- This is still crazy.

1:16:56.440 --> 1:16:58.681
No, it's not.
- I'm with Stan.

1:16:59.400 --> 1:17:01.402
So what if I can shoot good?

1:17:01.760 --> 1:17:03.046
You think a handful of stones
are going to stop...

1:17:03.200 --> 1:17:04.247
Show them, Richie.

1:17:05.200 --> 1:17:07.965
My mother's earrings, baby. Solid silver.

1:17:08.120 --> 1:17:11.044
That's just stuff in movies.
What good is it going to do against...

1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:15.125
They're silver. They can kill It.
Believe, Stannie. We have to.

1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:25.167
<i>"On my honor,
I will do my best</i>

1:17:25.400 --> 1:17:28.688
<i>"to do my duty to God and my country,</i>

"mentally awake and morally..."

1:17:37.720 --> 1:17:38.881
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

1:17:39.040 --> 1:17:41.202
- What are you mumbling about?
- Shh.

1:17:46.520 --> 1:17:47.851
Now, listen.

1:17:49.040 --> 1:17:50.610
You guys don't have to do this.

1:17:50.760 --> 1:17:53.240
My dad says you have to know
when to take a stand.

1:17:57.760 --> 1:17:59.364
Lucky seven, Stannie.

1:18:00.440 --> 1:18:01.646
I said I was in.

1:18:02.040 --> 1:18:05.487
Yeah, you think we're going to
let you have all the fun there, Billy-boy?

1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:07.281
Eddie?

1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:09.922
I'm with my friends. Right?

1:18:12.840 --> 1:18:14.080
Give me that.

1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:19.162
Yuck. It tastes like battery acid.

1:19:06.840 --> 1:19:09.764
- Where are they going?
- Down in the sewer, stupid.

1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:10.921
Yeah.

1:19:11.280 --> 1:19:12.281
And guess what?

1:19:14.120 --> 1:19:15.963
They're not coming back out.

1:19:43.920 --> 1:19:45.490
You mean
we gotta go down there?

1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:50.050
Stan, if you don't want to go...
Now's the time to turn back.

1:19:53.880 --> 1:19:55.882
Great choice. Let's go.

1:20:32.880 --> 1:20:33.881
All right.

1:20:34.040 --> 1:20:35.041
They're going down into the pipes.

1:20:35.200 --> 1:20:36.884
Remember when we chased that dog
down in there?

1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:38.087
Yeah.
- Okay.

1:20:38.240 --> 1:20:39.321
You go how we went.

1:20:39.520 --> 1:20:41.488
You'll come out ahead of them,
chase them back towards us.

1:20:41.640 --> 1:20:43.881
Me and Belch are gonna catch up to them.

1:20:44.040 --> 1:20:46.771
Hurry or there will be nothing
left for you.

1:20:48.920 --> 1:20:49.921
Go by myself, Henry?

1:20:50.080 --> 1:20:53.209
"Go by myself, Henry?"
Yeah, go by yourself.

1:20:53.360 --> 1:20:56.284
What are you afraid of, huh?
The boogeyman?

1:21:24.800 --> 1:21:25.961
Hardy-har-har.

1:21:26.280 --> 1:21:28.044
Yeah, well, at least we know
we're on It's trail.

1:21:28.200 --> 1:21:30.646
Maybe this is where it wants us to be.

1:21:30.800 --> 1:21:32.802
Eddie, which way is Derry?

1:21:36.320 --> 1:21:39.688
Okay. Look, Bev, you get up front
where you can get a clear shot.

1:21:39.840 --> 1:21:42.571
And you guys, stay together.
No stragglers.

1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:09.961
Hi, kid.

1:23:10.520 --> 1:23:12.249
I, uh, guess you're the first.

1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:04.244
- Who's missing?
- Stan.

1:24:04.400 --> 1:24:05.401
Oh, no!

1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:15.241
<i>Now, before you die,</i>

1:24:15.440 --> 1:24:17.886
I want you to think about
every rock you threw,

1:24:18.680 --> 1:24:20.330
<i>and everything you've said.</i>

1:24:20.880 --> 1:24:23.008
I want you to think about that
before you die.

1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:33.161
Hey, Henry.

1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:41.201
What was that?

1:25:15.480 --> 1:25:16.481
Belch!

1:25:18.520 --> 1:25:20.648
<i>God, he's not in there anymore.</i>

1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:22.801
Belch!

1:26:01.560 --> 1:26:02.686
Help!

1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:08.361
<i>It's Stan!</i>

1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:10.045
It's coming! It's coming!

1:26:13.760 --> 1:26:15.046
Hands, quick!

1:26:59.040 --> 1:27:01.247
Is that it? Did We do it?

1:27:01.480 --> 1:27:02.606
Look!

1:27:18.920 --> 1:27:22.163
Quick! Take hands
before we get lost in this stuff.

1:27:22.840 --> 1:27:24.171
Grab hold!

1:27:25.160 --> 1:27:26.650
Is everybody here?

1:27:27.480 --> 1:27:29.847
- I'm here. Stannie?
- Yeah.

1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:31.001
Richie?

1:27:31.400 --> 1:27:32.811
Yeah. Uh, Mike?

1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:35.651
Here.

1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:37.689
- Whose hand is this?
- Mine.

1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:39.330
That you, Ben?

1:27:39.720 --> 1:27:40.721
Yeah.

1:27:41.240 --> 1:27:43.402
Okay.
Whatever happens, hang on.

1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:46.689
It's not as strong as it thought it was,
or it could've killed us just then.

1:27:47.040 --> 1:27:48.724
We have to resist!

1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:53.801
<i>Bill! Bill!</i>

1:27:54.120 --> 1:27:55.360
Georgie?

1:27:56.240 --> 1:27:57.366
<i>No, Bill!</i>

1:27:58.680 --> 1:28:01.968
That's not George. Don't break the circle.

1:28:02.120 --> 1:28:03.201
<i>Bevy!</i>

1:28:04.280 --> 1:28:07.568
Bevy, what do you think you're doing
down here with these boys?

1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:09.250
Now, get home.

1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:12.165
Daddy? Daddy, I'm...

1:28:12.320 --> 1:28:13.970
<i>Wake up, hot stuff.</i>

1:28:14.320 --> 1:28:15.321
That ain't Daddy.

1:28:16.200 --> 1:28:17.361
There ain't nothing there.

1:28:23.240 --> 1:28:24.765
I said...

1:28:24.920 --> 1:28:28.925
I said there ain't nothing there.

1:28:33.800 --> 1:28:36.246
...I will do my best
to do my duty to God and my country.

1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:41.400
On my honor, I will do my best
to do my duty to God and my country.

1:29:01.720 --> 1:29:02.767
Ben?

1:29:08.680 --> 1:29:10.762
Stanley, resist!
That's it!

1:29:11.080 --> 1:29:14.448
Let go! Be afraid!

1:29:14.600 --> 1:29:16.011
Bev, the stones!

1:29:16.200 --> 1:29:19.602
You all taste so much better
when you're afraid!

1:29:19.760 --> 1:29:21.125
<i>Hurry, Bev, kill it!</i>

1:29:21.280 --> 1:29:22.441
"Kill"?

1:29:23.920 --> 1:29:25.046
<i>Me?</i>
Oh...

1:29:25.240 --> 1:29:27.402
<i>Oh, you are priceless, brat.</i>

1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:30.126
I am eternal, child.

1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:33.726
<i>I am the eater of worlds</i>

1:29:34.040 --> 1:29:35.485

1:29:36.640 --> 1:29:39.723
And you are next.

1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:47.361
This is battery acid, you slime!

1:29:57.600 --> 1:29:58.601
Please, God.

1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:08.729
- YOUNG RITCHIE; Kill it! Kill it, Bev!
- Kill it! Kill, Bev!

1:30:10.040 --> 1:30:11.405
Kill it, Bev!
Do it!

1:30:22.440 --> 1:30:24.602
Help me! Help me!

1:30:39.200 --> 1:30:41.202
it's dead?
I don't think so.

1:30:41.360 --> 1:30:43.044
- We got to get out of here.
- We've got to go after it!

1:30:43.200 --> 1:30:45.043
No, it's dead.
- We have to make sure!

1:30:45.200 --> 1:30:47.248
- It sounded like it was dying.
- Yeah, what if it didn't?

1:30:59.720 --> 1:31:02.644
- it's over.
- It's over.

1:31:03.600 --> 1:31:04.601
Right?

1:31:20.880 --> 1:31:22.564
Swear to me...

1:31:24.120 --> 1:31:26.885
Swear to me that if it isn't dead,

1:31:28.000 --> 1:31:29.764
we'll all come back.

1:31:36.760 --> 1:31:38.125
I swear.

1:31:42.480 --> 1:31:43.766
I swear.

1:31:47.520 --> 1:31:48.885
I swear it.

1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:00.164
Yeah, I swear.

1:32:04.760 --> 1:32:06.489
I swear, too.

1:32:20.880 --> 1:32:21.961
I swear.

1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:27.810
Swear.

1:32:41.080 --> 1:32:42.320
Stannie?

1:32:43.520 --> 1:32:47.047
I'm coming upstairs to scrub your back

1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:49.444
and your chest.

1:32:50.200 --> 1:32:51.406
And...

1:32:57.040 --> 1:32:58.451
Stanley?

1:33:02.280 --> 1:33:03.691
Stanley?

1:33:06.880 --> 1:33:08.166
Stan?

1:34:08.560 --> 1:34:09.846
Here you go.

1:34:10.880 --> 1:34:14.282
- You sure you don't want me to wait?
- No, thanks, I'll walk back.

1:34:32.720 --> 1:34:33.767
Georgie.

1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:38.523
How could I have forgotten?

1:34:40.240 --> 1:34:41.730
I'm so sorry.

1:34:53.480 --> 1:34:54.845
Take your pick...

1:34:55.280 --> 1:34:58.409
Billy-boy.

1:34:59.880 --> 1:35:00.881
on!

1:35:01.720 --> 1:35:04.087
Except for the one on the end.

1:35:04.960 --> 1:35:06.610
That's already taken.

1:35:07.200 --> 1:35:08.247
<i>Sorry.</i>

1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:11.970
I remember you.

1:35:12.480 --> 1:35:14.448
<i>And I remember we beat you.</i>

1:35:16.280 --> 1:35:17.850
I'm not afraid of you.

1:35:21.840 --> 1:35:23.330
I'm not afraid of you.

1:36:27.960 --> 1:36:29.564
I know how old I look.

1:36:29.760 --> 1:36:31.842
It's just that I remember you as a kid.

1:36:32.320 --> 1:36:34.049
Welcome home, Bill.

1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:37.962
I only wish it was under happier...

1:36:38.840 --> 1:36:40.569
Come on, let's go out.

1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:44.561
It occurred to me in there
that I didn't create any more paranoia

1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:46.006
than we already have here.

1:36:46.160 --> 1:36:48.049
I got a taste of it myself, earlier.

1:36:48.440 --> 1:36:50.363
At least people seem to care now.

1:36:50.520 --> 1:36:52.249
Or maybe it's just that
I'm a grown-up now.

1:36:52.760 --> 1:36:54.524
I feel so thick, Mike.

1:36:54.680 --> 1:36:56.682
I don't remember much of it at all,
what we did.

1:36:57.480 --> 1:37:00.768
I don't even remember why I came back,
except for Georgie.

1:37:01.520 --> 1:37:03.966
I'll bet it doesn't all come back at once.

1:37:04.320 --> 1:37:05.651
How come you remember?

1:37:05.840 --> 1:37:07.683
I never left, how could I forget?

1:37:07.880 --> 1:37:10.724
All I do is look on the street corner
and there we were. Seven of us.

1:37:10.880 --> 1:37:12.086
Lucky seven.

1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:15.083
Oh, man, that just came back.

1:37:16.280 --> 1:37:17.441
Something else.

1:37:18.240 --> 1:37:20.163
- One of us lived around here.
- Right.

1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:22.921
Bev!

1:37:23.160 --> 1:37:24.525
Right down the street.

1:37:25.600 --> 1:37:26.601
Her father...

1:37:26.760 --> 1:37:29.764
She was poor. Her father was the janitor.
This was Poor Town.

1:37:30.480 --> 1:37:31.686
Yeah, still is.

1:37:38.320 --> 1:37:39.321
Yours?

1:37:40.800 --> 1:37:43.849
Hey, I'm a bachelor, Bill.
It's all I need.

1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:46.122
It's clean and better yet, it's paid for.

1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:50.761
Feeling hungry?

1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:53.287
Frankly, I haven't had an appetite
since you called.

1:37:53.440 --> 1:37:56.284
I've arranged
dinner tonight for all of us.

1:37:56.720 --> 1:37:58.165
Have you seen any of the others?

1:37:58.320 --> 1:38:02.291
No. But I've had a feeling all afternoon

1:38:02.600 --> 1:38:06.002
I could tell whenever one of us hit town.
I don't think we're all here, yet.

1:38:07.440 --> 1:38:08.487
No.

1:38:09.160 --> 1:38:10.321
You, too?

1:38:10.920 --> 1:38:12.809
Whatever it is, it's powerful stuff.

1:38:13.480 --> 1:38:15.130
Well, here's to remembering.

1:38:18.840 --> 1:38:19.841
What?

1:38:21.400 --> 1:38:24.449
Maybe this will stimulate
those old memory banks a little.

1:38:32.040 --> 1:38:33.166
Silver.

1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:35.921
Yep, I ran across it in the pawn shop
about a year ago.

1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:38.004
I don't know, something made me buy it.

1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:40.329
It's got a flat tire,
but that's all that's wrong with it.

1:38:40.760 --> 1:38:42.444
But here's the real kicker.

1:38:44.840 --> 1:38:47.810
I bought this tube repair kit on impulse.

1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.241
About three months before I saw this bike.

1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:56.763
There was some kind of force
guiding us that summer.

1:38:56.920 --> 1:38:59.969
I don't know if it came just to help us
or if we created it.

1:39:00.240 --> 1:39:02.607
<i>But maybe it's still here.</i>

1:39:04.720 --> 1:39:06.051
I'm going to change clothes.

1:39:44.480 --> 1:39:46.323
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

1:39:46.560 --> 1:39:49.131
Not the Paramount, you slimeballs!

1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:52.131
<i>Where are the people of this city
supposed to get their culture?</i>

1:40:08.080 --> 1:40:09.491
- May I help you?
- Mike Hanlon.

1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:11.529
He stepped out a short while ago.

1:40:12.080 --> 1:40:14.242
- I'm pretty sure he's coming back.
- Good.

1:40:15.080 --> 1:40:19.404
Uh... I'm gonna sit here
and I'm gonna wait here for him.

1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:22.762
Come on, Tozier, get a grip.

1:40:26.440 --> 1:40:29.125
You look like you could use this.
It's just water.

1:40:30.280 --> 1:40:31.327
Thank you.

1:40:40.240 --> 1:40:43.005
<i>A little young for you,
isn't she, Richie?</i>

1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:46.243
<i>Beep, beep, Richie.</i>

1:40:46.440 --> 1:40:48.090
I didn't hear that.

1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:49.566
I didn't!

1:40:50.320 --> 1:40:51.810
I beg your pardon?

1:40:52.200 --> 1:40:54.089
<i>Come On up, Richie!</i>

1:40:54.840 --> 1:40:57.650
I got a balloon for you.

1:40:58.680 --> 1:41:00.364
Don't you want a balloon?

1:41:03.160 --> 1:41:06.721
What's the matter, one balloon not enough?

1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:09.043
Try a bunch!

1:41:34.520 --> 1:41:35.931
Is everything all right?

1:41:36.200 --> 1:41:38.009
- Yes...
- Last chance, Tozier.

1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:40.925
Get out before it gets dark tonight.

1:41:41.480 --> 1:41:44.006
You're too old to stop me.

1:41:44.240 --> 1:41:46.322
You're all too old.

1:41:47.520 --> 1:41:49.921
- Tell Mike Hanlon if you see him...
- Excuse me, sir.

1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:52.886
Do you have Prince Albert in a can?

1:41:53.120 --> 1:41:54.246
You do?

1:41:54.480 --> 1:41:56.130
Well, you better let the poor guy out.

1:41:58.080 --> 1:42:01.209
Tell Mike Hanlon that I had to go.

1:42:01.560 --> 1:42:04.450
That I had to get cleaned up. Tell him.

1:42:05.120 --> 1:42:06.485
<i>Tell him.</i>

1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:09.127
Tell him I'll see him tonight.

1:42:09.280 --> 1:42:10.281
Get out!

1:42:10.920 --> 1:42:12.922
<i>Last chance, Tozier. Get out!</i>

1:42:13.280 --> 1:42:15.282
<i>Get out while you can.</i>

1:42:15.760 --> 1:42:17.728
<i>Excuse me, ma'am.</i>

1:42:17.880 --> 1:42:21.089
<i>Is your refrigerator running? It is?</i>

1:42:21.520 --> 1:42:24.490
<i>Well, you better catch it
before it runs away.</i>

1:42:49.760 --> 1:42:50.761
MIKE; Whoa!

1:43:07.200 --> 1:43:08.201
Whoa!

1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:12.442
All right!

1:43:31.320 --> 1:43:32.321
Son of a gun.

1:43:33.040 --> 1:43:35.611
Not just any cards, Bicycle.

1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:38.483
They always made the best noise.

1:43:50.440 --> 1:43:51.646
Bill?

1:43:54.400 --> 1:43:55.481
I see it.

1:44:03.200 --> 1:44:06.204
<i>All right, you follow up on this
Miller thing. I'll call Todd myself.</i>

1:44:06.360 --> 1:44:08.761
What about the engineer's report?

1:44:08.920 --> 1:44:10.081
What's that?

1:44:11.240 --> 1:44:14.926
You're breaking up, Fran.
I'll call you from the hotel.

1:44:26.440 --> 1:44:27.805
Pull over here, will you?

1:44:34.320 --> 1:44:35.560
Wait for me.

1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:03.567
You're it! You're it!

1:45:04.400 --> 1:45:06.402
You're dead, fat boy.
Come on!

1:45:06.880 --> 1:45:08.211
You're going to die!

1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:11.805
- Yeah!
- Get him!

1:45:15.240 --> 1:45:17.402
<i>You're dead! You're dead!</i>

1:45:17.600 --> 1:45:19.125
Run, fat boy!

1:45:22.680 --> 1:45:25.081
You're it, porky.
You're it!

1:45:25.760 --> 1:45:28.286
- Have a nice trip.
- See you later, porky.

1:45:37.440 --> 1:45:40.046
Hey, you okay, buddy?
My knee.

1:45:50.440 --> 1:45:52.761
Lucky for me you have that hankie thing.

1:45:53.120 --> 1:45:56.806
Be prepared.
Here, why don't you just keep it?

1:45:58.760 --> 1:46:00.524
I think I'll be okay now.

1:46:00.720 --> 1:46:03.291
Hang tough, champ. You're gonna make it.

1:46:06.440 --> 1:46:08.124
<i>Ben Hanscom!</i>

1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:12.482
<i>It's nice to see you again.</i>

1:46:14.320 --> 1:46:16.641
<i>What have you been up to all these years?</i>

1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:28.605
We can't wait
to get you down here with us.

1:46:30.440 --> 1:46:33.444
You're in my mind. Only in my mind.

1:46:44.480 --> 1:46:46.482
Any spare change, mister?

1:46:46.760 --> 1:46:49.240
Hey, who walked all over your grave?

1:46:50.040 --> 1:46:52.008
I wasn't going to hurt you.

1:46:52.680 --> 1:46:53.920
I don't even know you.

1:46:57.800 --> 1:46:58.847
Let's go.

1:47:05.360 --> 1:47:07.328
- Derry Inn, did you say?
- Yeah.

1:47:07.880 --> 1:47:09.882
Reliving your childhood down there?

1:47:10.760 --> 1:47:14.765
Something like that. Just saying hi
to some old ghosts, you know.

1:47:47.600 --> 1:47:49.762
Oh, hell. Time does go by.

1:47:56.440 --> 1:47:57.680
<i>Here's that prescription.</i>

1:47:59.440 --> 1:48:00.646
How old are you now, son?

1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:03.609
Eleven. Almost 12.

1:48:04.640 --> 1:48:07.041
Old enough. Come with me.

1:48:09.240 --> 1:48:10.241
Come on.

1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:19.961
Relax, Eddie. I'm not gonna bite you.

1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:23.921
Now, most of your troubles come from
you being so tight and stiff all the time.

1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:26.441
You take your asthma, for instance.

1:48:29.600 --> 1:48:31.602
Do you know what a placebo is, Eddie?

1:48:32.280 --> 1:48:33.281
I got to go.

1:48:33.520 --> 1:48:34.567
It's water, Eddie.

1:48:34.760 --> 1:48:37.206
Water with a squirt of camphor
to make it taste like medicine.

1:48:37.400 --> 1:48:38.401
No.

1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:41.849
Your doctor is weak and your mother
is determined that you're ill.

1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:43.923
And you, my friend,
are caught in the middle.

1:48:44.480 --> 1:48:48.405
It's all a lie, a great big lie!
I do have asthma. I do!

1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:52.926
<i>Sir?</i>

1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:55.645
Your prescription.

1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:03.009
Nothing like a good pull
on the old lung-sucker, huh?

1:49:04.640 --> 1:49:05.641
Thank you.

1:49:05.960 --> 1:49:09.487
<i>Junior, bring me a cigar.</i>

1:49:09.800 --> 1:49:11.484
You know you can't have one, Granddad.

1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:15.446
Mr. Keene?

1:49:19.760 --> 1:49:21.808
Mr. Keene. Hello.

1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:25.282
Cigar for the old man?

1:49:25.480 --> 1:49:27.289
I'm sorry. I don't have any.

1:49:27.440 --> 1:49:30.569
I'm Eddie Kaspbrak, Sonia Kaspbrak's son.

1:49:31.320 --> 1:49:33.243
How about some licorice?

1:49:33.680 --> 1:49:36.081
I was always partial to licorice.

1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:41.571
Mr. Keene, I just wanted to thank you

1:49:41.760 --> 1:49:44.206
for trying to tell me the truth
a long time ago.

1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:51.965
You look a little peaked, sonny.

1:49:54.680 --> 1:49:55.841
I'd better go.

1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:57.240
Hydrox.

1:49:58.400 --> 1:49:59.401
What?

1:49:59.920 --> 1:50:01.888
H20.

1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:03.601
Water.

1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:07.288
<i>It's only water.</i>

1:50:07.960 --> 1:50:10.327
It's all in your head, sonny.

1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:13.602
You do remember me.

1:50:13.840 --> 1:50:14.841
Oh, Mr. Keene...

1:50:16.600 --> 1:50:17.931
Mr. Keene?

1:50:18.200 --> 1:50:21.522
Get out of Derry while you still can.

1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:23.530
Mr. Keene, please.

1:50:24.040 --> 1:50:26.122
Beware, little Eddie.

1:50:26.360 --> 1:50:29.125
Beware, girly-boy.

1:50:34.080 --> 1:50:36.048
No cigar, sonny.

1:50:36.760 --> 1:50:39.730
<i>I was always partial to licorice.</i>

1:51:19.240 --> 1:51:22.084
I'm sorry, I must have rung the
wrong bell. I was looking for Marsh.

1:51:22.320 --> 1:51:23.321
- Marsh?
- Yes.

1:51:23.520 --> 1:51:26.000
There's no Marsh here. Unless...

1:51:27.080 --> 1:51:28.684
You don't mean Alvin Marsh?

1:51:29.240 --> 1:51:30.571
Yes, my father.

1:51:30.880 --> 1:51:32.325
Oh, Miss...

1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:35.121
I hate to be the one to have
to tell you this, a stranger,

1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:37.408
but your father's been dead
this last five years.

1:51:38.560 --> 1:51:39.766
But on the bell...

1:51:42.720 --> 1:51:43.721
Oh...

1:51:44.280 --> 1:51:46.442
Kersh. I thought it said "Marsh."

1:51:46.960 --> 1:51:49.645
I'm Mrs. Kersh.
I knew your father a little.

1:51:51.200 --> 1:51:53.885
- Come in. Let me give you tea.
- No, I couldn't.

1:51:54.280 --> 1:51:56.408
You could and you will. I insist.

1:52:09.800 --> 1:52:11.290
Feel free to look around.

1:52:12.160 --> 1:52:14.447
Perhaps you'd like to freshen up?

1:52:49.000 --> 1:52:52.209
<i>Did you fall
asleep in there? It's teatime.</i>

1:52:57.360 --> 1:52:58.691
Tea.

1:52:59.320 --> 1:53:00.685
Tea would be nice.

1:53:02.160 --> 1:53:04.128
I love what you've done with the place.

1:53:04.360 --> 1:53:06.886
It's so different, so cozy.

1:53:07.160 --> 1:53:08.844
How kind you are, miss.

1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:12.204
I call all the pretty young girls "Miss".
Don't take offense.

1:53:12.600 --> 1:53:13.761
No.

1:53:23.280 --> 1:53:26.045
Well, go on, dear,
drink it while it's nice and hot.

1:53:40.560 --> 1:53:42.642
Don't trouble your
pretty little head, dear.

1:53:42.920 --> 1:53:44.285
I'll get it.

1:53:45.040 --> 1:53:47.042
It did say "Marsh" on the doorbell.

1:53:47.680 --> 1:53:50.081
If you're wise, you'll run, dear, run.

1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:52.921
Because to stay will mean
worse than your death.

1:53:53.080 --> 1:53:54.889
They float down there.

1:53:56.240 --> 1:53:57.321
<i>They float.</i>

1:54:00.560 --> 1:54:03.643
I worry about you, Bevy. I worry a lot.

1:54:06.040 --> 1:54:08.327
It won't do you any good to run, Bevy.

1:54:10.920 --> 1:54:13.764
You're not real! You're not real!

1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:19.281
Beep, beep!

1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:13.209
<i>I told you the first time
you introduced me to him</i>

1:55:13.360 --> 1:55:14.850
<i>that he was a twit, Audra.</i>

1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:16.001
<i>Do you remember?</i>

1:55:16.160 --> 1:55:17.844
Greco, I didn't ask you over
to insult Bill.

1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.480
- How dare he do this to me.
- Come on.

1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:23.041
You've been complaining about him
ever since we started this picture.

1:55:23.280 --> 1:55:25.760
He'll never work in movies again.
I suppose you know that.

1:55:26.280 --> 1:55:29.841
If you could have seen his face.
It was frightening.

1:55:30.720 --> 1:55:34.611
Nothing like a little crisis to bring
the estranged couple closer together, eh?

1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:38.604
Or perhaps pull them farther apart,
if the gods are smiling.

1:55:38.840 --> 1:55:39.887
Greco, please.

1:55:40.120 --> 1:55:44.125
I'm simply pointing out that this
could be a blessing in disguise.

1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:47.361
Would you consider giving me a few days?

1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:51.285
I shall pretend I didn't hear that, Audra.

1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:55.323
I can replace your imbecilic husband.
I cannot replace you.

1:55:57.360 --> 1:55:59.249
Don't even think about leaving, Audra.

1:56:00.240 --> 1:56:03.084
<i>You've worked very hard
to get where you are. Very hard.</i>

1:56:03.480 --> 1:56:05.562
I know you'd do nothing
to jeopardize that.

1:56:05.960 --> 1:56:09.123
Or to damage
our professional relationship.

1:56:09.840 --> 1:56:11.968
Or to turn a friend overnight
into a violent enemy,

1:56:12.120 --> 1:56:14.202
ready to crucify you at any cost.

1:56:18.720 --> 1:56:20.449
But there's no need to talk about that.

1:56:23.120 --> 1:56:24.770
See you tomorrow.

1:56:42.080 --> 1:56:44.242
International reservations, please.

1:56:44.880 --> 1:56:48.282
Yes, I'd like a seat on your next
flight to the United States.

1:57:09.480 --> 1:57:11.926
Excuse me,
I'm looking for the Hanlon party.

1:57:14.880 --> 1:57:16.291
- Eddie?
- Ben?

1:57:16.720 --> 1:57:18.961
- Eddie Kaspbrak.
- Haystack!

1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:23.211
- What happened to the rest of you?
- Gone but not forgotten.

1:57:23.400 --> 1:57:24.401
Hey. buddy!

1:57:27.640 --> 1:57:28.687
Oh, my God.

1:57:31.240 --> 1:57:33.322
Where's Richie Tozier
when you need a good line?

1:57:33.680 --> 1:57:35.887
- Ben?
- I'm afraid so, Bill.

1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:38.202
I can't believe it. Look at you.
Hey, Bill.

1:57:38.400 --> 1:57:40.801
Hey.
Michael, God.

1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:43.600
Mike, is that you?
Such as I am, Haystack.

1:57:48.800 --> 1:57:50.404
Hey, listen. Who wants a drink?

1:57:50.720 --> 1:57:52.290
- Set them up.
- I'll have one.

1:57:52.440 --> 1:57:54.010
<i>What is this?
That's my dog.</i>

1:57:54.160 --> 1:57:56.640
<i>I'll have</i> a <i>club soda, okay?
This is pretty good.</i>

1:58:03.040 --> 1:58:05.725
Come on, Tozier, don't let them
see you like this, get a grip, man.

1:58:05.920 --> 1:58:07.968
That was a hallucination.
It was a flashback deal.

1:58:08.120 --> 1:58:10.327
It was too much fun in '67.
Just get ahold.

1:58:11.920 --> 1:58:13.206
You're working too hard, kid.

1:58:13.440 --> 1:58:14.680
Jeez, you guys.

1:58:15.840 --> 1:58:17.524
I got a toast. I propose...

1:58:17.680 --> 1:58:19.762
All right, who got bald, who got wrinkled,

1:58:19.920 --> 1:58:21.843
and how many of God's children got wings?

1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:23.604
- Beep, beep, Richie!
- Richie!

1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:25.410
Richie, beep, beep.
- Mike, hey!

1:58:29.000 --> 1:58:31.321
Hey, buddy, how are you?
Fine, fine. You?

1:58:32.040 --> 1:58:33.041
Beverly?

1:58:34.520 --> 1:58:36.727
What a bunch of handsome old men.

1:58:41.440 --> 1:58:42.441
EDDIE; Oh!

1:58:51.920 --> 1:58:53.251
Hi, good-looking.

1:58:53.560 --> 1:58:55.722
Oh, Richie.

1:58:56.200 --> 1:58:57.201
Oh...

1:58:58.560 --> 1:58:59.686
Eddie!

1:58:59.840 --> 1:59:03.242
I'd rather catch you than anybody else
in the whole world, Beverly Marsh.

1:59:06.440 --> 1:59:07.441
Oh...

1:59:08.640 --> 1:59:11.246
I just saw all of you standing there

1:59:11.400 --> 1:59:14.085
and so much came flooding back,
it was like a tidal wave.

1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:17.371
Oh, Mike.
What are we getting ourselves into?

1:59:20.680 --> 1:59:22.045
Hi, Bev.
Hey.

1:59:24.920 --> 1:59:26.922
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

1:59:27.840 --> 1:59:28.887
Where's...

1:59:41.520 --> 1:59:42.965
Are you all right, Bev?

1:59:44.360 --> 1:59:45.441
Yes.

1:59:46.760 --> 1:59:47.886
No. I...

1:59:49.680 --> 1:59:51.284
I saw something today.

1:59:51.760 --> 1:59:53.524
Same with me.
Oh, man!

1:59:53.960 --> 1:59:56.804
- What I saw at the library, whoa...
- Was it Pennywise?

1:59:57.440 --> 1:59:59.283
With both barrels, it was Pennywise.

1:59:59.440 --> 2:00:00.726
He's working on us already.

2:00:00.920 --> 2:00:03.446
- Trying to chip away.
- Maybe that means he's afraid.

2:00:03.600 --> 2:00:05.762
It. It's afraid.

2:00:06.040 --> 2:00:07.485
Oh, man. It!

2:00:07.800 --> 2:00:10.770
Help us remember, Mike.
Help us fill in the gaps.

2:00:10.960 --> 2:00:14.487
Yeah, please, because I don't know
what you are guys talking about.

2:00:16.840 --> 2:00:21.289
I can't remember much of anything
and when I try, it kind of clouds over.

2:00:23.160 --> 2:00:24.525
I mean, didn't you feel it?

2:00:24.960 --> 2:00:26.644
<i>As soon as I crossed the county line,</i>

2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:29.565
it was like this veil
dropped over my eyes.

2:00:30.160 --> 2:00:31.571
Maybe it's the water.

2:00:32.320 --> 2:00:34.163
The water? Maybe it's the sewer.

2:00:37.040 --> 2:00:39.042
This is battery acid, you slime!

2:00:42.960 --> 2:00:44.564
Eddie!
Take a breath, man. Breathe.

2:00:50.320 --> 2:00:51.731
I'm okay.

2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.731
I think I remember who Pennywise was now.

2:00:55.000 --> 2:00:57.526
Big white guy, red nose,

2:00:58.120 --> 2:01:01.761
about 75 feet tall,
mouth full of razor sharp teeth.

2:01:02.880 --> 2:01:04.530
Oh, Eddie.

2:01:08.640 --> 2:01:10.768
What the hell is happening, you guys?

2:01:11.360 --> 2:01:13.249
What is going on?

2:01:15.960 --> 2:01:20.124
I'm sorry.
It was just a very vivid memory.

2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:24.322
I had forgotten that I stared
that creep right in the face.

2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:27.530
And you saved Stan's life.
You remember that part?

2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:29.361
Yeah.

2:01:30.520 --> 2:01:31.806
Yeah, now I do.

2:01:32.200 --> 2:01:34.885
Hey, speaking of Stan. Stan? Stan!

2:01:35.440 --> 2:01:37.090
Where is his royal straightness anyway?

2:01:37.240 --> 2:01:38.401
He wouldn't fink out on us,
would he, Mike?

2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:39.726
You talked to him, right?

2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:41.405
Yeah, I think he'll be along.

2:01:41.680 --> 2:01:44.650
I think we ought to go ahead without him.
When he gets here, we can fill him in.

2:01:44.840 --> 2:01:46.410
Come on, Mike, talk to us,
help us remember.

2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:48.403
No. Wait a minute.
I don't know about you guys,

2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:50.722
but this is the first time
since I got here that I feel good.

2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:53.486
I mean, I feel halfway safe. Come on.

2:01:54.040 --> 2:01:55.326
Let's have a couple of drinks,

2:01:55.480 --> 2:01:57.847
chew on some good food,
have a couple of chucks.

2:01:58.000 --> 2:01:59.206
And letâ€™s just leave
the wolf out the door.

2:01:59.400 --> 2:02:01.482
Spoken like a real loser, Richie.

2:02:01.640 --> 2:02:03.688
Hey, to the Loser's Club.

2:02:03.920 --> 2:02:06.571
- All right!
- To the Loser's Club.

2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:21.485
Talking about your wives?

2:03:21.800 --> 2:03:24.041
How many times have you been
to the altar, Richie?

2:03:24.200 --> 2:03:27.044
Four or five.
Who the hell keeps count?

2:03:27.200 --> 2:03:29.123
Women all want the same thing.
No offense, Bev.

2:03:29.280 --> 2:03:32.921
None taken, creep.
Welcome to the fourth century.

2:03:33.080 --> 2:03:34.411
What about you, Ben, you married?

2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:37.484
Nope, I've dodged the bullet
a number of times, now.

2:03:37.680 --> 2:03:39.284
How about you, Eddie?
<i>Me?</i>

2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.287
Yeah, I'm seeing this
really wonderful woman,

2:03:42.440 --> 2:03:44.920
but with the business and all,
I really don't have too much time.

2:03:45.280 --> 2:03:48.841
You take it from me, spaghetti man,
better dead than wed.

2:03:49.080 --> 2:03:51.082
Any little crumb
snatchers for you, Richie?

2:03:51.240 --> 2:03:52.526
None that I know of.

2:03:52.920 --> 2:03:54.684
<i>How about you, Bev?</i>
What?

2:03:55.520 --> 2:03:57.648
- How about you?
- Oh, uh...

2:03:58.280 --> 2:03:59.520
Well, I live with a...

2:04:00.200 --> 2:04:01.964
No, I'm not married.

2:04:03.440 --> 2:04:05.681
Richie, what ever happened
to those glasses?

2:04:05.880 --> 2:04:06.961
Contact lenses.

2:04:07.200 --> 2:04:10.409
Richie, for the number of times
you broke those glasses of yours,

2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:13.570
you should have had stock in
an adhesive tape company.

2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:15.524
Me and Henry Bowers.

2:04:18.040 --> 2:04:20.247
Somebody please tell me
he was hit by a freight train

2:04:20.400 --> 2:04:21.731
and put out of his misery.

2:04:21.880 --> 2:04:25.009
No such luck. You wanna see Henry Bowers
you'll find him up at Juniper Hills.

2:04:25.160 --> 2:04:28.562
Ever since the trial, where he confessed
to all the murders of all the children.

2:04:28.720 --> 2:04:31.803
- He was down there with us in the sewers.
- That creep was gonna kill Stan.

2:04:31.960 --> 2:04:33.405
He was going to kill us all.

2:04:33.560 --> 2:04:36.723
I remember when they pulled him out,
his hair had turned white.

2:04:36.880 --> 2:04:39.360
- He was babbling about a bright light.
- And a clown.

2:04:39.520 --> 2:04:41.010
And no one believed him.

2:04:41.200 --> 2:04:42.725
Except when he said
he killed all the kids.

2:04:42.880 --> 2:04:45.565
<i>And we didn't say anything.</i>
Not a word.

2:04:46.360 --> 2:04:49.569
But it was the killer and we stopped it.

2:04:50.400 --> 2:04:51.731
We thought we did.

2:05:01.920 --> 2:05:03.081
<i>Henry.</i>

2:05:04.320 --> 2:05:05.765
<i>Henry Bowers.</i>

2:05:10.880 --> 2:05:12.928
Up here, sharp stuff.

2:05:15.400 --> 2:05:16.481
<i>Up here!</i>

2:05:17.600 --> 2:05:19.807
You helped me once. Remember?

2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:21.924
You chased those brats.

2:05:22.080 --> 2:05:24.924
Almost got them, Henry. Almost.

2:05:25.840 --> 2:05:27.285
Don't you want another chance?

2:05:28.600 --> 2:05:31.331
<i>You've got to go back and finish the job.</i>

2:05:31.800 --> 2:05:34.770
<i>You've got to go back to Derry
and kill them all.</i>

2:05:34.960 --> 2:05:36.962
<i>For me, Henry.</i>

2:05:37.440 --> 2:05:38.965
<i>Kill them all.</i>

2:05:39.440 --> 2:05:41.442
Henry, kill them all.

2:05:41.600 --> 2:05:46.049
Kill them all. Kill them all.

2:05:46.200 --> 2:05:47.440
Kill them all.

2:05:47.640 --> 2:05:49.642
Kill them all!

2:05:53.080 --> 2:05:55.128
Well, sports fans,
this has been a real hoot,

2:05:55.840 --> 2:05:57.649
00 a.m.

2:05:57.800 --> 2:05:58.926
Richie, you're not leaving?

2:05:59.080 --> 2:06:01.162
Bev, girl, what do you want, an adventure?

2:06:02.080 --> 2:06:03.525
<i>You got some high-toned idea</i>

2:06:03.680 --> 2:06:05.489
<i>that you're gonna go relive
that old nightmare?</i>

2:06:05.640 --> 2:06:07.642
I love you, but count me out.

2:06:07.800 --> 2:06:09.484
I'm going to a hotel.
I'm gonna get some sleep,

2:06:09.640 --> 2:06:13.167
and in the morning, I get on a plane
and I'm out of here forever.

2:06:13.480 --> 2:06:16.006
- I will remember all of you very fondly.
<i>- Richie?</i>

2:06:16.360 --> 2:06:18.488
Hey, man, we're all scared.
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

2:06:18.640 --> 2:06:20.369
Maybe he's right.

2:06:22.480 --> 2:06:25.131
I mean, if you are talking about
going back into the sewer?

2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:26.520
<i>We don't know
what we're talking about yet</i>

2:06:26.720 --> 2:06:28.324
mainly because we haven't talked
about it yet.

2:06:28.480 --> 2:06:30.801
Yeah, suppose we give Mike
a chance to fill us in

2:06:30.960 --> 2:06:32.325
<i>before we scatter to the four winds.</i>

2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:33.686
Or is that too much trouble, Richie?

2:06:33.920 --> 2:06:35.763
All I'm saying is I'm gonna
go get some sleep.

2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:37.126
Is that too much to ask?

2:06:37.520 --> 2:06:39.010
Why don't we show Michael
a little courtesy...

2:06:39.160 --> 2:06:40.730
Guys! Guys, come, on!

2:06:40.880 --> 2:06:43.167
It's all right, Ben.
If Richie wants to go, he goes.

2:06:43.360 --> 2:06:46.091
Now, we all came here based
on the strength of a promise.

2:06:46.480 --> 2:06:49.609
As far as I'm concerned, everybody at
this table made good on that promise.

2:06:49.920 --> 2:06:51.524
Wherever we go from here,

2:06:52.240 --> 2:06:54.129
I have no expectations.

2:06:55.000 --> 2:06:56.570
Well said, Michael.

2:06:56.800 --> 2:06:58.450
It's all right.
It's taken care of, Richie.

2:06:58.840 --> 2:07:00.649
No, you can't do that.

2:07:00.880 --> 2:07:02.530
Guys, that's just the way it is.

2:07:05.520 --> 2:07:08.490
All right, then.
A toast to Mr. Michael Hanlon.

2:07:08.800 --> 2:07:11.804
<i>A man without whom none of this
would have been necessary.</i>

2:07:11.960 --> 2:07:13.246
I can see my fortune now,

2:07:13.400 --> 2:07:17.086
"You're gonna be eaten by a big,
greasy monster. Have a nice day."

2:07:44.200 --> 2:07:45.361
Dummy up, everybody.

2:07:54.240 --> 2:07:57.244
What is it? What's wrong?
Is something the matter?

2:07:58.080 --> 2:08:01.368
Our friend had an asthma attack,
but he's better now.

2:08:01.560 --> 2:08:05.121
I'm much better. Thank you. Thank you.

2:08:05.400 --> 2:08:07.084
Everything was okay?

2:08:07.280 --> 2:08:10.329
<i>Everything was fine, thank you.
Very fine. Thank you, Rose.</i>

2:08:18.160 --> 2:08:21.050
Guys, I'm not so sleepy anymore.

2:08:22.280 --> 2:08:23.486
Let's get the hell out of here.

2:08:38.280 --> 2:08:39.770
Is this the Uris residence?

2:08:40.200 --> 2:08:43.807
<i>Is Stan there?
This is Mike Hanlon, an old friend.</i>

2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:47.448
What are we supposed to do now?

2:08:47.800 --> 2:08:49.131
Hey, spaghetti man, no problem.

2:08:49.320 --> 2:08:51.926
A little soap, a little elbow grease
ought to clean it right up.

2:09:09.560 --> 2:09:12.564
<i>Why are we the only ones
that can see this?</i>

2:09:13.120 --> 2:09:17.523
Well now, there you've got me stumped.
Let's ask the answer man. Oh, Mike?

2:09:19.800 --> 2:09:21.131
Oh, Michel...

2:09:21.280 --> 2:09:22.281
<i>GarÃ§on?</i>

2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:24.761
Hold on just a sec. Hello, Stan?

2:09:25.120 --> 2:09:26.565
Mike Hanlon.

2:09:26.760 --> 2:09:29.445
Is this the Uris residence?
I'm trying to get ahold of Stan Uris.

2:09:29.800 --> 2:09:33.486
You tell that loser that if he hasn't
left already, he's a dead man.

2:09:33.640 --> 2:09:35.210
We all managed to show up.

2:09:35.360 --> 2:09:37.488
Boy, that matches your real hair.
Has anyone ever told you...

2:09:37.840 --> 2:09:39.604
Is anyone from out of town?

2:09:40.560 --> 2:09:42.847
I don't know about you.
I just flew in from LA, boy, and...

2:09:43.040 --> 2:09:44.530
<i>Boy, is my tail section tired.</i>

2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:47.730
Yeah, not a chance. We're hot tonight.

2:09:47.920 --> 2:09:51.367
It's great to be back in Derry,
breathing in that old Derry air.

2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:55.282
<i>I have never felt so much love in one
room in my entire life.</i>

2:09:55.840 --> 2:09:56.966
Eddie, get all their names

2:09:57.120 --> 2:09:58.485
I wanna put them on my Christmas mailer.

2:09:58.760 --> 2:10:01.843
No, Denbrough there, let's put him
on my Norman Mailer!

2:10:04.080 --> 2:10:07.562
I love this man.
He's like the brother I never had.

2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:10.047
Wait a minute.
He is the brother I never had.

2:10:10.480 --> 2:10:12.403
Beep, beep, Richie. Stan?

2:10:22.600 --> 2:10:23.726
Thank you.

2:10:27.160 --> 2:10:28.241
Stan is dead.

2:10:38.880 --> 2:10:42.089
He cut his wrists in the bathtub
right after I phoned him.

2:11:10.280 --> 2:11:12.965
Stan was the last one of us to see it
that summer.

2:11:13.920 --> 2:11:15.001
Remember?

2:11:15.160 --> 2:11:18.881
All summer long he kept saying,
"That just isn't empirically possible."

2:11:20.440 --> 2:11:22.966
Even seeing the clown
didn't make it real for him.

2:11:23.440 --> 2:11:24.487
Nothing did.

2:11:25.120 --> 2:11:27.122
<i>Until that afternoon in August.</i>

2:11:33.880 --> 2:11:36.929
<i>I remember
I was coming down Chestnut Street</i>

2:11:37.120 --> 2:11:40.408
<i>and I saw Stan running through the park
like something was after him.</i>

2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:42.481
<i>Go!</i>

2:11:42.720 --> 2:11:45.724
- Go!
- Hi yo, Silver. Away!

2:11:46.800 --> 2:11:48.643
<i>I can't honestly say
I saw anything that day.</i>

2:11:48.800 --> 2:11:50.484
<i>Stan's the one who saw it.</i>

2:11:52.160 --> 2:11:56.643
<i>I was pedaling too fast to turn around.
I didn't want to see it. Whatever it was.</i>

2:11:57.400 --> 2:12:00.370
<i>It took him hours to calm down enough
to tell me what happened.</i>

2:12:01.520 --> 2:12:05.002
<i>He said he was down
in Lampkin Park by a bird feeder.</i>

2:12:05.840 --> 2:12:07.285
<i>Watching birds.</i>

2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:09.643
<i>Like a good Boy Scout.</i>

2:12:09.840 --> 2:12:12.161
<i>Remember? He used to call it
"collecting birds".</i>

2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:22.684
<i>Stan...</i>

2:12:25.560 --> 2:12:26.686
<i>Stan...</i>

2:12:38.560 --> 2:12:41.370
<i>He said he didn't mean
to go into that house,</i>

2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:45.564
<i>but this voice kept whispering to him.</i>

2:12:46.160 --> 2:12:50.006
<i>And naturally, being Stan, he figured
there was a rational explanation.</i>

2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:53.047
Hello?

2:12:56.040 --> 2:12:57.485
<i>Stanley.</i>

2:12:59.040 --> 2:13:01.566
Yeah? I'm right here.

2:13:31.360 --> 2:13:32.691
He was trapped.

2:13:32.840 --> 2:13:34.251
<i>The only thing he could think of to do</i>

2:13:34.440 --> 2:13:36.681
<i>was to hold his bird book out
in front of him like a shield</i>

2:13:36.840 --> 2:13:39.605
<i>and say as loud as he could the names
of all the birds he could remember.</i>

2:13:39.760 --> 2:13:40.921
Longneck finch...

2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:43.563
Speckled grouse, Baltimore oriole...

2:13:46.440 --> 2:13:49.649
Great egret, hammerhead Woodpecker
and brown thrush.

2:13:52.800 --> 2:13:54.006
Brown thrush.

2:13:55.600 --> 2:13:57.807
The day that we went into the sewer

2:13:58.640 --> 2:14:00.130
Stan saw it.

2:14:01.520 --> 2:14:03.090
Face to face.

2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:09.649
Not the clown,
but he saw what was behind the clown.

2:14:12.040 --> 2:14:14.850
He ran up to me in school and he said,

2:14:15.040 --> 2:14:16.963
"I saw It, Eddie.

2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:21.003
"I looked right into its..."

2:14:22.360 --> 2:14:24.010
Some kind of lights.

2:14:26.960 --> 2:14:29.122
"I looked right into its deadlights."

2:14:31.160 --> 2:14:33.162
Then he said,

2:14:33.320 --> 2:14:36.802
and I hadn't thought of it until just now,
I swear, he said,

2:14:37.120 --> 2:14:40.761
"I looked into its deadlights
and I wanted to be there."

2:14:41.120 --> 2:14:42.326
Deadlights.

2:14:54.960 --> 2:14:57.566
I need a drink.
- Yeah, me, too.

2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:01.006
I'm sure I've got something here.
Anybody else?

2:15:01.200 --> 2:15:02.201
Yeah.

2:15:10.960 --> 2:15:12.041
Stan!

2:15:12.200 --> 2:15:14.680
Sorry, I'm late.
Well, let's see who's here.

2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:19.206
Billy-boy!

2:15:20.080 --> 2:15:22.890
Richie, you still here?
We never expected you to stick around.

2:15:23.040 --> 2:15:25.327
Nice nose job. No one would ever suspect.

2:15:25.800 --> 2:15:28.121
Haystack, putting on a little weight, huh?

2:15:28.520 --> 2:15:31.046
Speaking of dads, Bevy,
yours isn't worried about you anymore.

2:15:31.200 --> 2:15:32.611
<i>He loves your choice in men.</i>

2:15:33.040 --> 2:15:36.123
Wheezy, how's your sex life?
What's your sex life?

2:15:37.040 --> 2:15:38.724
Well, Mikey, you did it.
You got us all back here.

2:15:38.880 --> 2:15:41.008
<i>I guess it's 'cause it's
the only way you'd ever see us</i>

2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:43.686
<i>since you're so lame
you'd never leave this town.</i>

2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:47.009
I finally made it, guys.
I'm in the deadlights now.

2:15:47.360 --> 2:15:49.567
<i>And you know what?
It's true what they say.</i>

2:15:49.720 --> 2:15:52.644
We all float down here and you will, too.

2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:55.770
In fact, they all float!

2:15:56.240 --> 2:15:58.561
They all float!

2:16:19.480 --> 2:16:20.686
My God!

2:16:57.520 --> 2:16:58.567
All right.

2:16:58.760 --> 2:17:01.525
I don't know about the rest of you,
I'm getting real sick of this place.

2:17:01.800 --> 2:17:06.124
Now I'll listen to anything anybody has to
say, but could we do it someplace else?

2:17:06.360 --> 2:17:07.441
Please!

2:17:07.760 --> 2:17:09.171
Okay. Just help me with the stuff.

2:17:16.680 --> 2:17:17.806
Bill.

2:17:18.400 --> 2:17:19.526
What is it?

2:17:23.600 --> 2:17:25.045
"He thrusts his..."

2:17:29.160 --> 2:17:33.165
"He thrusts his fists against the post
and still insists he see the ghosts."

2:17:33.560 --> 2:17:35.403
That's all it says over and over
and over again.

2:17:37.600 --> 2:17:40.046
My mom gave me that to say

2:17:41.800 --> 2:17:45.043
to help with my stutter.

2:17:49.560 --> 2:17:51.642
No offense, pal, it ain't helping.

2:17:57.200 --> 2:17:59.851
Let's get the hell out of here.
What do you say?

2:18:22.200 --> 2:18:23.281
<i>Henry!</i>

2:18:24.200 --> 2:18:25.281
<i>Down here.</i>

2:18:32.960 --> 2:18:34.928
Belch? What are you doing down there?

2:18:35.880 --> 2:18:38.963
You got a problem in there
you need some help with, Henry?

2:18:42.960 --> 2:18:44.644
That's a good boy.

2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:49.929
<i>You don't
have to talk out loud, Henry.</i>

2:18:50.200 --> 2:18:53.568
I can hear you when you just think it
and they can't hear me at all.

2:18:54.120 --> 2:18:56.930
<i>What do you want?</i>
- Same thing you want.

2:18:57.440 --> 2:18:58.771
I want to pay them back.

2:19:00.600 --> 2:19:01.931
<i>Yeah, pay them back.</i>

2:19:02.440 --> 2:19:04.090
But you're gonna have to get out of here.

2:19:04.240 --> 2:19:05.810
You're gonna have to go back to Derry.

2:19:08.080 --> 2:19:11.641
I need you,
Henry. We all need you.

2:19:12.640 --> 2:19:14.085
<i>They can't hurt you.</i>

2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:17.330
We didn't think they could hurt us back
then either, but they did, didn't they?

2:19:17.760 --> 2:19:20.366
<i>Bested you all summer.
Don't talk about that.</i>

2:19:20.600 --> 2:19:23.604
I can take care of them
if they only half believe.

2:19:24.280 --> 2:19:26.123
But you, you're alive, Henry.

2:19:26.760 --> 2:19:28.125
You can get them
no matter if they believe,

2:19:28.280 --> 2:19:30.601
half believe or don't believe at all.

2:19:31.720 --> 2:19:34.451
One by one, Henry.

2:19:34.600 --> 2:19:36.125
<i>I can't get out of here.</i>

2:19:36.400 --> 2:19:39.085
<i>They got wires on the windows,</i>

2:19:40.240 --> 2:19:43.528
<i>and Koontz is on the door tonight.
Man, Koontz is the worst.</i>

2:19:44.160 --> 2:19:45.207
<i>I hate him.</i>

2:19:45.680 --> 2:19:47.523
I'll take care of Koontz, Henry.

2:19:56.640 --> 2:19:58.005
Lead the way, Henry.

2:19:59.840 --> 2:20:01.080
Lead the way.

2:20:20.920 --> 2:20:22.729
All right, dog meat, I've had it.

2:20:22.880 --> 2:20:24.325
Your head's
gonna be bouncing off the floor...

2:20:57.080 --> 2:20:59.321
No, no, no, Mike. No, no, no.

2:21:00.360 --> 2:21:02.727
I will have no need of this stuff, Mike.

2:21:02.880 --> 2:21:06.362
Thank you very much for thinking
about me and including it just in case.

2:21:06.560 --> 2:21:09.211
But none for me, thank you very much!

2:21:09.360 --> 2:21:11.328
- Richie, you're shouting.
- What? I know!

2:21:11.560 --> 2:21:14.006
Beep, beep, Richie. Beep, beep.

2:21:14.800 --> 2:21:17.167
Talk to us, Mike. Tell us stories.

2:21:17.400 --> 2:21:21.007
Tell us things so we don't have to
remember what we just saw in the library.

2:21:22.840 --> 2:21:27.129
Hey, Eddie. Come on, pal.
Don't let it get you. Fight it.

2:21:28.880 --> 2:21:32.248
I saw myself today.
I saw myself back there.

2:21:32.920 --> 2:21:36.402
I know it's just camphor water,
I know that, but I need it anyway.

2:21:36.680 --> 2:21:38.364
Take it easy, pal.

2:21:38.640 --> 2:21:41.689
If it works, Eddie, it's good medicine.
You've always believed in it,

2:21:41.840 --> 2:21:43.922
- that's all that ever mattered.
- Thanks.

2:21:46.080 --> 2:21:49.641
I'm sure by now you all remember
what was going on in Derry 30 years ago.

2:21:50.120 --> 2:21:54.603
There was a rash of killings, maimings,
disappearances, mostly of children.

2:21:54.760 --> 2:21:57.570
Everybody was afraid,
but nobody did anything.

2:21:58.440 --> 2:22:00.090
Until we went after it.

2:22:03.600 --> 2:22:04.840
<i>We almost killed it.</i>

2:22:07.600 --> 2:22:10.410
Henry Bowers confessed to everything
and the killings stopped.

2:22:10.720 --> 2:22:13.405
Until earlier this year,
exactly 30 years later.

2:22:13.680 --> 2:22:15.284
<i>Now, the first thing you should know is,</i>

2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:17.044
if you count backwards
in 30-year increments,

2:22:17.200 --> 2:22:21.603
every date you come to will correspond
to a huge disaster in Derry's history.

2:22:21.920 --> 2:22:24.161
<i>In 1960, the big fire
at the Black Spot Club.</i>

2:22:24.360 --> 2:22:27.091
In 1930, the explosion
down at the old ironworks.

2:22:27.280 --> 2:22:30.727
In 1900, the massacre at Drake's Creek.
And on, and on.

2:22:31.680 --> 2:22:37.403
The biggest mystery is how 253 settlers
just disappeared without a trace.

2:22:37.960 --> 2:22:42.841
Thank you, Michael, for that illuminating,
if somewhat morbid, history.

2:22:43.600 --> 2:22:45.329
<i>She didn't want to know.</i>

2:22:45.520 --> 2:22:47.409
You knew all about this, even then.

2:22:47.560 --> 2:22:49.528
Miss Douglas didn't want to know.

2:22:49.680 --> 2:22:51.569
It's a disease, Bev.

2:22:52.320 --> 2:22:54.561
The Derry disease.
None of them wants to know.

2:22:54.760 --> 2:22:58.321
- It's too horrible so they act like...
- They act like it didn't even happen.

2:22:58.480 --> 2:23:01.848
I remember a man, Mr. Ross,

2:23:02.920 --> 2:23:07.164
he was on his front porch,
I was coming home from school.

2:23:07.680 --> 2:23:11.321
<i>Henry Bowers was waiting
right outside my house.</i>

2:23:13.840 --> 2:23:16.730
<i>I saw Mr. Ross across the street.</i>

2:23:17.280 --> 2:23:21.683
<i>He looked so concerned,
I thought he was going to help me,</i>

2:23:22.520 --> 2:23:26.241
<i>but I couldn't believe it,
he just turned around and went inside.</i>

2:23:33.680 --> 2:23:35.330
<i>That was when it really hit me</i>

2:23:35.480 --> 2:23:38.484
there was something
terribly wrong in Derry, with Derry.

2:23:39.280 --> 2:23:41.328
How did you get out of that, Bev?

2:23:41.880 --> 2:23:46.044
Daddy came home, one of the only times
I was ever really glad to see him.

2:23:48.360 --> 2:23:52.968
So, it's 30 years later and right
on schedule the killings start up again.

2:23:53.240 --> 2:23:54.571
Six so far, maybe more.

2:23:54.880 --> 2:23:57.724
<i>There have been a number of disappearances
with no trace of a body.</i>

2:23:58.320 --> 2:24:01.369
I wanted to be absolutely certain
before I called anyone.

2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:03.045
And I became absolutely certain

2:24:03.200 --> 2:24:05.362
when I found something
at the latest crime site.

2:24:05.880 --> 2:24:07.962
God, that was just yesterday.

2:24:10.400 --> 2:24:12.880
Anyway, this is it.

2:24:18.680 --> 2:24:19.886
Georgie?

2:24:26.400 --> 2:24:27.401
For whatever reason,

2:24:27.600 --> 2:24:30.251
there's something
very special about us being together.

2:24:30.560 --> 2:24:33.962
We found each other that summer
and our togetherness made us strong.

2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:37.363
Otherwise, it would have picked us off,
one by one.

2:24:37.840 --> 2:24:38.966
Think about it.

2:24:39.120 --> 2:24:41.043
Is it an accident
that none of us have kids?

2:24:41.200 --> 2:24:42.440
Including Stan.

2:24:42.800 --> 2:24:45.610
Or that when we came together
as young people,

2:24:45.760 --> 2:24:47.489
we were all losers.

2:24:49.920 --> 2:24:51.365
<i>Now look at you.</i>

2:24:52.120 --> 2:24:54.851
Six of you left Derry
and became unusually successful.

2:24:55.040 --> 2:24:56.280
Big-time breadwinners.

2:24:56.440 --> 2:24:57.851
Leaving you here holding the bag.

2:24:58.040 --> 2:25:00.042
Yeah. You kept the lighthouse
for the rest of us.

2:25:00.200 --> 2:25:01.964
I feel like a real jerk about that, Mike.

2:25:02.120 --> 2:25:03.121
Me, too.

2:25:03.440 --> 2:25:04.680
It's nobody's fault.

2:25:04.880 --> 2:25:08.123
Our parents decided
who stayed and who went.

2:25:08.440 --> 2:25:11.011
When I grew up, I stayed here
because I wanted to.

2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:13.328
I think you stayed because you had to.

2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:16.806
I don't know what's gonna happen
when the sun comes up,

2:25:17.000 --> 2:25:20.129
but I do know that I appreciate
what you've done for everyone.

2:25:44.120 --> 2:25:47.329
Good evening. You're up late.
- How much farther is Derry?

2:25:47.800 --> 2:25:48.801
Oh...

2:25:49.280 --> 2:25:53.330
I guess about maybe
500 yards to the city limits.

2:25:53.640 --> 2:25:57.087
Oh, thank God.
I nearly fell asleep a while ago.

2:25:57.240 --> 2:25:58.924
I feel like I've been driving forever.

2:25:59.440 --> 2:26:02.205
Just cross the old bridge down there
at the barrens and hang a left.

2:26:02.520 --> 2:26:03.567
The barrens?

2:26:04.000 --> 2:26:06.287
Yes, where
they used to play when they were kids.

2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:12.204
Thank you. I'll be going now.

2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:18.011
Don't you want your balloon first,
Mrs. Denbrough?

2:26:18.840 --> 2:26:20.046
Don't you want it?

2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:23.287
Don't you want it?

2:26:24.680 --> 2:26:25.727
<i>Don't you want it?</i>

2:26:26.960 --> 2:26:28.166
Don't you want it?

2:26:28.560 --> 2:26:29.721
<i>Don't you want it?</i>

2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:31.360
Don't you want it?

2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:32.921
<i>Don't you want it?</i>

2:26:34.800 --> 2:26:36.006
<i>Don't you want it?</i>

2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:40.368
<i>They chased me up the hall,
past the lockers,</i>

2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:42.403
<i>they got me down
and they started slapping me.</i>

2:26:42.680 --> 2:26:45.604
<i>The coach found me lying there,
I was crying,</i>

2:26:45.760 --> 2:26:47.364
<i>and I thought he was gonna help me.</i>

2:26:47.720 --> 2:26:51.122
But instead, he just made fun of me
and something inside snapped. I got mad.

2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:52.890
I said, "Coach, you coach track, right?"

2:26:53.040 --> 2:26:55.486
He sort of sneered at me and nodded,
and I said,

2:26:55.680 --> 2:26:57.728
"Well, you listen to me,
you stone-brained son of a bitch,

2:26:57.880 --> 2:26:59.245
"I'm gonna go out for
the track team in March

2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:00.811
"and I'm gonna run down
everything you got.

2:27:00.960 --> 2:27:02.166
"I'm gonna run down your best

2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:05.051
"and then
I want a flipping apology from you."

2:27:05.320 --> 2:27:06.446
All right.

2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:08.400
And so you did it?

2:27:08.560 --> 2:27:10.244
Yeah, I ran everywhere.

2:27:10.400 --> 2:27:13.768
Sometimes, my heart felt like it was
pounding so hard I was gonna pass out.

2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:15.763
And the first time I ran a mile,
I puked, then fainted.

2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:19.208
<i>Finally, I was holding up
my pants as I ran.</i>

2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:21.362
I mean, I ate salads
like there was no tomorrow.

2:27:21.560 --> 2:27:25.281
By March, I'd lost 70 pounds
and I'd grown two inches.

2:27:25.560 --> 2:27:27.722
Every time I ran, I felt like I could fly.

2:27:27.880 --> 2:27:30.486
- And you went out?
- I went out for track just like I said.

2:27:30.640 --> 2:27:33.450
First day I was out there
I won the 220 and the 440.

2:27:33.600 --> 2:27:35.250
I just blew away the coaches. Best guys.

2:27:35.400 --> 2:27:37.084
After practice,
I walked right up to the coach

2:27:37.280 --> 2:27:40.124
and I asked for that apology.
He was so furious, he hit me.

2:27:40.280 --> 2:27:42.089
- No! After all that...
- It was perfect!

2:27:42.240 --> 2:27:44.527
- You beat him!
- And everybody knew it.

2:27:44.960 --> 2:27:47.611
I graduated from El Paso High
with a letter in track.

2:27:47.760 --> 2:27:51.321
And the coach lost his job
over that little love tap.

2:27:52.640 --> 2:27:54.847
That's great, Ben.
You ought to write that one down.

2:27:55.000 --> 2:27:57.446
- Bill's our writer.
- I just write horror stories.

2:27:57.600 --> 2:27:59.568
You know, we still haven't talked
about what we're going to do,

2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:00.761
if we're gonna do anything.

2:28:01.480 --> 2:28:04.051
On, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey...

2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:06.405
Listen, kids.

2:28:06.840 --> 2:28:08.808
This campfire stuff is fun, it really is,

2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:12.328
but it doesn't matter how painstakingly
we go over these sewer plans

2:28:12.480 --> 2:28:15.484
or how many damn flashlights
or helmets you got in that box.

2:28:15.640 --> 2:28:17.369
When the sun comes up, I'm dust,

2:28:17.560 --> 2:28:20.006
and I would suggest that
the rest of you follow me

2:28:20.200 --> 2:28:22.009
and get the hell out of Dodge!

2:28:22.480 --> 2:28:24.482
I cleaned it up once.
<i>Cleaned what?</i>

2:28:26.800 --> 2:28:27.961
The blood.

2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:31.286
I cleaned the whole thing up
that very same night.

2:29:02.200 --> 2:29:05.602
<i>I decided if I was ever
going to sleep in this house again,</i>

2:29:05.800 --> 2:29:07.040
<i>I'd have to know the truth.</i>

2:29:08.040 --> 2:29:10.361
<i>To see if anyone besides me
could see the blood.</i>

2:29:23.080 --> 2:29:25.890
What happened in here?
Somebody get murdered?

2:29:28.000 --> 2:29:30.890
You see it? You really see it?

2:29:34.880 --> 2:29:36.882
Come on, let's clean this up.

2:29:42.000 --> 2:29:45.721
<i>Until that moment,
I thought I was going crazy.</i>

2:29:45.880 --> 2:29:49.407
<i>It was so strange to be happy
about something so grim.</i>

2:29:50.240 --> 2:29:52.925
I fell in love with all of you guys
that day.

2:29:53.920 --> 2:29:56.571
And after we cleaned it up,
the blood never came back.

2:30:04.520 --> 2:30:06.204
It will be morning soon.

2:30:08.400 --> 2:30:10.562
- I'm cold.
- Me, too.

2:30:11.240 --> 2:30:13.925
- I'll get you something.
- There's a shawl in my room.

2:30:14.080 --> 2:30:16.924
Give me your room key and I'll get it.

2:30:17.640 --> 2:30:19.369
Richie, you have a key?

2:30:19.800 --> 2:30:21.086
<i>All right. Now, listen up.</i>

2:30:21.280 --> 2:30:23.282
Stay together, guys. No stragglers.

2:30:25.240 --> 2:30:28.289
Just get the first thing you find.
I need to stretch my legs anyway.

2:30:28.480 --> 2:30:29.527
Ben.

2:30:29.720 --> 2:30:32.564
- Don't go alone.
- Uh, I need a refill anyway.

2:30:33.560 --> 2:30:34.766
I'll join you.

2:30:47.240 --> 2:30:48.321
I'll take care of Richie.

2:30:48.480 --> 2:30:51.723
Okay. We meet back here in three minutes,
no more. Keep your doors open.

2:31:41.640 --> 2:31:45.122
Hello, nigger. I'll pay you back.

2:31:45.720 --> 2:31:47.051
I'm gonna pay you all back.

2:32:02.080 --> 2:32:03.570
Oh, good. You found it.

2:32:06.880 --> 2:32:10.680
I'm glad we're alone for a minute.
I've been wanting to say something to you.

2:32:13.360 --> 2:32:16.887
"Your hair is winter fire. January embers.

2:32:18.720 --> 2:32:21.724
- "My heart burns there, too."
- It was you.

2:32:22.880 --> 2:32:25.565
I've been waiting a long time
to thank the poet.

2:32:30.560 --> 2:32:32.847
- Did you ask Bill first?
- No.

2:32:33.560 --> 2:32:36.404
I knew it was you.
I've always known it was you.

2:32:38.040 --> 2:32:41.044
I think I must have been waiting, Ben,
waiting until we were both ready.

2:32:42.840 --> 2:32:44.365
I'm ready now. Are you?

2:32:56.240 --> 2:32:58.527
Oh, oh, Beverly.

2:33:15.760 --> 2:33:17.205
Kiss me, fat boy!

2:33:55.160 --> 2:33:56.400
Belch...

2:34:04.160 --> 2:34:06.162
Mike! Mike!

2:34:06.840 --> 2:34:07.966
Mike!

2:34:11.160 --> 2:34:12.969
You all right?
I got it.

2:34:16.480 --> 2:34:18.164
Get him in there.
Give me a hand.

2:34:18.720 --> 2:34:20.324
Watch it! Okay, easy.

2:34:23.880 --> 2:34:25.370
- In the car.
- Hurry up!

2:34:26.160 --> 2:34:27.764
Go! Go! Go!
No, Mike!

2:35:04.040 --> 2:35:06.566
<i>If Mike dies,
there will be five of us left.</i>

2:35:08.120 --> 2:35:10.566
Who comes next? Which one of us?

2:35:12.840 --> 2:35:14.524
Why is it doing this?

2:35:15.400 --> 2:35:16.731
Why does It hate?

2:35:17.480 --> 2:35:19.562
Why is It so mean?

2:35:28.880 --> 2:35:30.245
Oh, Ben.

2:35:32.920 --> 2:35:34.524
I want to tell you something.

2:35:35.280 --> 2:35:37.169
You remember what my father was like?

2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:41.606
I fell in love with a man

2:35:41.760 --> 2:35:45.890
who turned out to be everything
I always hated in my father.

2:35:49.280 --> 2:35:52.966
Why would I do that?
How could I be so blind?

2:35:54.440 --> 2:35:58.729
If you see it now,
you're not blind anymore, Bev.

2:36:00.040 --> 2:36:01.929
Congratulations. That's a miracle.

2:36:03.320 --> 2:36:05.846
Besides, at least you fell in love
with somebody.

2:36:07.400 --> 2:36:10.131
At least you felt something.

2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:12.930
That's a miracle, too.

2:36:14.280 --> 2:36:16.248
You have the heart of a poet, Ben.

2:36:20.440 --> 2:36:22.442
"Your hair is winter fire."

2:36:25.120 --> 2:36:27.726
- Why did you say that?
- You wrote it, didn't you?

2:36:28.200 --> 2:36:30.885
"Your hair is winter fire.
January embers." Something.

2:36:31.600 --> 2:36:33.967
When I was young, I thought it was Bill,
but it was you, wasn't it?

2:36:34.120 --> 2:36:36.327
Damn it, Bev, is that you in there
or is that the clown?

2:36:36.480 --> 2:36:38.767
I don't know what the hell is going on!
How am I supposed to know?

2:36:38.960 --> 2:36:39.961
It's me.

2:36:41.400 --> 2:36:42.731
It's me.

2:36:55.000 --> 2:36:57.002
"My heart burns there, too."

2:37:32.560 --> 2:37:34.642
Mike's gonna be okay.
Can we see him?

2:37:34.920 --> 2:37:36.046
He's not out of the woods yet.

2:37:36.200 --> 2:37:38.521
I guess one of you could go in
for just a minute.

2:37:48.760 --> 2:37:49.841
Mike?

2:37:51.600 --> 2:37:53.443
Everyone else is right outside.

2:37:54.680 --> 2:37:56.842
- Henry?
- He's dead.

2:37:58.520 --> 2:37:59.885
- Police?
- Not yet.

2:38:01.960 --> 2:38:04.042
Be careful. We can't trust anyone.

2:38:04.560 --> 2:38:07.006
If anybody asks, a party got out of hand.

2:38:07.200 --> 2:38:09.248
You were dancing on the table,
you took a fall.

2:38:10.720 --> 2:38:13.041
Anyone who's seen me dance will buy that.

2:38:14.760 --> 2:38:17.730
- What are you going to do?
- I don't know, man.

2:38:18.080 --> 2:38:19.764
I honestly do not know.

2:38:20.880 --> 2:38:22.882
My jacket. Outside pocket.

2:38:34.240 --> 2:38:36.402
<i>It's silver. It can kill It.</i>

2:38:38.080 --> 2:38:40.082
But we left these down in the...

2:38:43.760 --> 2:38:45.091
You went back?

2:38:46.800 --> 2:38:48.768
I was pretty sure it was asleep.

2:38:49.640 --> 2:38:51.085
"Pretty sure"?

2:38:52.120 --> 2:38:53.360
You went alone?

2:38:54.440 --> 2:38:58.047
Ten years ago my life was going downhill.
I was close to suicide.

2:38:58.840 --> 2:39:01.161
I think I really wanted It
to wake up and kill me.

2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:03.841
<i>Took me all day
stumbling around in the dark.</i>

2:39:04.000 --> 2:39:05.081
<i>I found one right away.</i>

2:39:05.680 --> 2:39:07.011
In the drain trap.

2:39:07.280 --> 2:39:10.682
The other one, the one that hit Pennywise,
was lodged in a crack in the wall.

2:39:13.280 --> 2:39:15.965
I figured we might need that kind of help
again one day.

2:39:17.360 --> 2:39:19.886
When I came out,
I kind of I got my life together.

2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:23.085
The only change was this.

2:39:23.800 --> 2:39:25.040
Almost overnight.

2:39:28.160 --> 2:39:29.321
Fear.

2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:32.647
Bill.

2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:35.163
If you decide not use those,

2:39:35.800 --> 2:39:38.724
if you leave, I'll understand.

2:39:45.520 --> 2:39:47.284
People, that is a dead body.

2:39:47.440 --> 2:39:50.603
You're not seriously suggesting we walk
out of here and leave it lying there?

2:39:50.760 --> 2:39:51.886
Yeah. That's what I'm suggesting.

2:39:52.040 --> 2:39:54.566
- I think we ought to call the police.
- I think Eddie's right.

2:39:54.720 --> 2:39:58.406
You don't understand. This whole town
is It in some way. All of them.

2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:10.486
Bill's right.

2:40:10.960 --> 2:40:12.962
If we call the police,
get the town involved,

2:40:13.160 --> 2:40:14.889
something bad's going to
happen to one of us.

2:40:15.080 --> 2:40:16.366
Maybe all of us.

2:40:16.840 --> 2:40:21.528
All right. Have it your way. Stan is dead.
Mike came close. I've seen enough.

2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:22.681
I'm with you, boy.

2:40:22.880 --> 2:40:24.769
You can put this behind you
just like that?

2:40:24.920 --> 2:40:27.366
I'm a little old
for monster hunting, Bill.

2:40:27.520 --> 2:40:28.521
So was Mike.

2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:30.251
So was Stan.

2:40:31.040 --> 2:40:33.088
- Is that how you feel, Ben?
- I don't know how I feel.

2:40:33.240 --> 2:40:35.208
All I know is, I can't stay
in this room much longer.

2:40:35.360 --> 2:40:39.524
So I suggest we just turn on the TV,
hang a "Do not disturb" sign on the door,

2:40:39.720 --> 2:40:42.007
go outside, then figure out what to do.

2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:43.731
I second that.

2:40:55.840 --> 2:40:58.730
<i>Police Chief Andrew Rademacher
of the downtown branch said the victim,</i>

2:40:58.880 --> 2:41:00.086
<i>5-year-old Danielle Huxton,</i>

2:41:00.240 --> 2:41:02.242
<i>had been playing
at the creek near her home.</i>

2:41:02.560 --> 2:41:05.450
<i>Local authorities have not yet said
whether there might be a connection</i>

2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:08.968
<i>between this and a recent rash of
disappearances involving young children.</i>

2:41:09.440 --> 2:41:12.444
<i>They did reveal, however,
that the body was severely mutilated.</i>

2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:15.771
<i>In other news tonight,
a series of robberies in the east end</i>

2:41:15.920 --> 2:41:17.081
<i>has local officials baffled...</i>

2:41:19.760 --> 2:41:22.684
Appreciate it if you just
put that on my card, send me a receipt.

2:41:22.840 --> 2:41:24.490
- Oh, certainly, Mr. Hanscom.
- Me, too, thank you.

2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:26.569
- Ditto, thanks.
- Nice time, loads of fun. Got to go, bye.

2:42:13.560 --> 2:42:14.721
Need a ride, Bill?

2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:17.082
- Where are you going, Richie?
- Airport.

2:42:17.640 --> 2:42:20.041
- I guess we are, too, Bill.
- Come with us.

2:42:21.000 --> 2:42:24.641
I just saw something
and I have no idea if it was real.

2:42:26.160 --> 2:42:28.481
<i>If any of you would have seen it or not.</i>

2:42:30.000 --> 2:42:31.081
I can't go.

2:42:32.360 --> 2:42:35.443
Because if I do, I'm gonna
live with this until I go insane.

2:42:36.360 --> 2:42:40.206
Until I can't tell the difference
between my life and my bad dreams.

2:42:41.520 --> 2:42:43.761
For years I've been getting paid
to scare people.

2:42:45.920 --> 2:42:47.843
But I'm the one who's been scared.

2:42:49.560 --> 2:42:50.891
All my life.

2:42:52.480 --> 2:42:54.448
I don't want to be scared anymore.

2:42:57.120 --> 2:42:58.451
I'm going back in.

2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:03.650
This time I'm gonna kill It.

2:43:04.280 --> 2:43:05.327
<i>Help me!</i>

2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:07.481
<i>Help me!</i>

2:43:11.280 --> 2:43:12.964
Please, help me.

2:44:17.960 --> 2:44:20.406
I don't suppose anybody thought
to bring anything really useful,

2:44:20.560 --> 2:44:21.800
like a machine gun?

2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:24.440
I brought this. It's the only thing
I saved from those days.

2:44:24.840 --> 2:44:27.320
- I remember you were a dead shot, Bev.
- You couldn't miss.

2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:29.767
It was like it was supposed
to be Bev, remember?

2:44:29.960 --> 2:44:32.122
You hit the clown, Pennywise,
in the head, it broke open.

2:44:32.280 --> 2:44:34.442
- And underneath it was a light.
- Bright lights.

2:44:34.600 --> 2:44:36.523
Deadlights. We saw them, too,
for a second.

2:44:36.720 --> 2:44:37.801
Bev?

2:44:37.960 --> 2:44:40.964
- Bill, how on earth...
- Mike went back down and got them.

2:44:41.960 --> 2:44:44.645
These are for him and for Stan.

2:44:46.800 --> 2:44:48.802
- Lucky seven.
- We're all here now.

2:44:50.320 --> 2:44:54.370
Oh, come on, guys. What the hell are you
going to do now? Sing <i>Kumbaya?</i>

2:44:54.960 --> 2:44:58.646
Wake up. Take a breath. Do you smell that?

2:44:58.920 --> 2:44:59.967
That's death.

2:45:00.160 --> 2:45:02.891
It's not for Mike, it's not for Stan,
it's not for Henry Bowers.

2:45:03.080 --> 2:45:04.809
It's for us. It's in the air.

2:45:04.960 --> 2:45:08.760
Losers fight It, losers die.
And you know that, don't you, Captain?

2:45:09.400 --> 2:45:12.244
- You don't have to go down there, Richie.
- Right.

2:45:12.400 --> 2:45:13.765
I didn't have to get on a plane in LA,

2:45:13.960 --> 2:45:16.531
I didn't have to go to the dinner,
I sure as hell didn't have to come here.

2:45:16.680 --> 2:45:18.364
And now I don't have to go in.

2:45:24.960 --> 2:45:27.361
I still say we should have brought
a machine gun.

2:46:35.120 --> 2:46:39.444
I remember the first thing I saw down here
was one of those damn pom-poms.

2:46:45.480 --> 2:46:49.769
- This purse looks new.
- Oh, dear God. It's not possible.

2:46:50.240 --> 2:46:51.924
- Audra.
- What?

2:46:52.120 --> 2:46:54.930
How in God's name...
She's down here.

2:46:55.240 --> 2:46:56.287
- His wife?
- It's got her.

2:46:56.560 --> 2:46:58.324
- How could she...
- it could be a trick or something.

2:46:58.920 --> 2:47:00.285
Bill, wait, damn it!

2:47:00.440 --> 2:47:01.646
Audra!

2:47:16.200 --> 2:47:18.168
Audra. Audra.

2:47:18.360 --> 2:47:20.203
<i>Bill.
Come back, Bill!</i>

2:47:21.960 --> 2:47:24.281
- Do you want to get yourself killed?
- Oh, God, Bill!

2:47:24.480 --> 2:47:26.209
God, Bill, you all right?

2:47:27.080 --> 2:47:30.562
It's my fault. She followed me.

2:47:32.520 --> 2:47:33.965
I told her...
Bill, that's enough!

2:47:34.160 --> 2:47:36.686
If she is down here,
there's only one way you can help her.

2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:40.443
Now you know what we came down here for
and we're going to do it.

2:47:40.600 --> 2:47:44.321
Now, we need you. We need you
to stand up for us like before,

2:47:44.480 --> 2:47:46.050
or none of us is going to get out of here.

2:47:57.800 --> 2:47:59.040
Come on.

2:48:05.000 --> 2:48:06.411
Stay close together.

2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:27.570
- Looks like we're off the map.
- I think...

2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:30.646
That way.

2:49:07.160 --> 2:49:08.525
We're here.

2:49:10.480 --> 2:49:12.960
The roots all grow down.
Yeah.

2:49:13.160 --> 2:49:15.891
- Yeah, the walls cracked, remember?
- When It came.

2:49:16.080 --> 2:49:18.731
Dear God, please don't let these things
come to life.

2:49:18.880 --> 2:49:20.803
Don't you even think that, spaghetti man.

2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:22.968
I told you not to call me "spaghetti man."

2:49:23.120 --> 2:49:25.646
I think something is coming.

2:50:02.960 --> 2:50:04.849
- My boat.
- Georgie.

2:50:05.920 --> 2:50:07.285
It's all your fault.

2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:09.569
Oh... Georgie.

2:50:09.840 --> 2:50:13.481
All your fault, Bill.
You sent me out and It killed me.

2:50:14.240 --> 2:50:18.040
No. No, Georgie. I didn't know.

2:50:18.200 --> 2:50:21.647
Bill, remember, that's not Georgie.
Remember. Fight it!

2:50:22.280 --> 2:50:23.964
It was in the drain, Bill.

2:50:24.200 --> 2:50:26.851
It was in the drain.
And you let It kill me.

2:50:27.600 --> 2:50:30.126
No. I loved you.

2:50:30.320 --> 2:50:31.810
Damn it, Bill,
that thing's not your brother.

2:50:31.960 --> 2:50:33.803
Come on, man.
Fight it.

2:50:36.240 --> 2:50:39.050
You are not George.

2:50:41.480 --> 2:50:43.244
George is dead,

2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:45.604
and it's not my fault.

2:50:54.160 --> 2:50:56.731
You killed my brother, George,
you bastard.

2:50:57.160 --> 2:50:58.685
Let's see you now.

2:51:00.160 --> 2:51:01.366
<i>Let's see you now.</i>

2:51:02.840 --> 2:51:04.330
Show yourself.

2:51:09.360 --> 2:51:11.362
You killed my little brother

2:51:12.520 --> 2:51:14.568
and now you're going to pay.

2:51:20.480 --> 2:51:23.404
<i>Go while you still can.</i>

2:51:25.200 --> 2:51:28.522
<i>This is your last chance.</i>

2:51:29.200 --> 2:51:30.531
Show yourself.

2:51:33.520 --> 2:51:35.010
<i>Silly boy.</i>

2:51:35.320 --> 2:51:39.041
You still think you can see me.

2:51:41.640 --> 2:51:43.085
You'll never see me.

2:51:43.240 --> 2:51:46.926
<i>You'll see only
what your little mind can allow.</i>

2:51:47.440 --> 2:51:49.602
Go! Now.

2:51:49.920 --> 2:51:51.763
For if you stay,

2:51:52.400 --> 2:51:54.721
you'll lose your little mind

2:51:55.120 --> 2:51:58.044
in my deadlights.

2:51:58.880 --> 2:52:00.291
<i>Like all the others.</i>

2:52:01.240 --> 2:52:03.402
Like all the others.

2:52:22.920 --> 2:52:27.881
Bill. We can't fight that thing.
That's like trying to fight smoke.

2:52:28.120 --> 2:52:30.771
Don't you understand
what Mike was trying to tell us?

2:52:31.240 --> 2:52:33.083
It feeds, Richie.

2:52:33.560 --> 2:52:36.609
It wakes up every 30 years and it feeds.

2:52:36.920 --> 2:52:41.164
And in order to feed, it has
to take on some kind of physical form.

2:52:43.120 --> 2:52:44.451
It's here.

2:52:45.800 --> 2:52:47.882
Down here. Somewhere.

2:53:57.160 --> 2:53:58.685
Fee, fi, fo, fum.

2:53:59.840 --> 2:54:01.729
- You think we're strong enough?
- We have to be.

2:54:01.880 --> 2:54:04.247
I have to tell you guys something
before we go in there.

2:54:04.440 --> 2:54:06.090
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

2:54:07.960 --> 2:54:09.689
- I've been lying.
- About what?

2:54:10.360 --> 2:54:12.362
When I said that I was seeing someone.

2:54:13.280 --> 2:54:16.568
Well, I'm not. In fact, I haven't ever...

2:54:17.880 --> 2:54:20.531
I mean, I've never even been with any...

2:54:20.840 --> 2:54:22.968
Eddie, what are you saying?
You're a virgin?

2:54:23.320 --> 2:54:24.367
Yeah.

2:54:25.200 --> 2:54:27.680
Well, I can't help you with that, pal.
But thanks for sharing.

2:54:27.840 --> 2:54:29.285
Richie, let him talk.

2:54:31.720 --> 2:54:33.051
You see...

2:54:33.560 --> 2:54:36.882
I could never sleep
with somebody that I didn't love.

2:54:37.480 --> 2:54:39.960
And I've never really loved anyone.

2:54:42.240 --> 2:54:43.844
Except you guys.

2:54:45.560 --> 2:54:46.561
Hey.

2:55:44.720 --> 2:55:46.165
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:00.323
A body.

2:56:05.320 --> 2:56:06.481
Audra.

2:56:07.160 --> 2:56:09.162
- Bill, for God's sake!
- Wait for us, buddy.

2:56:09.400 --> 2:56:11.164
It's Audra. I'm going to get her.

2:56:40.600 --> 2:56:41.886
Bill...

2:56:47.840 --> 2:56:49.171
I damn you to hell.

2:56:58.960 --> 2:57:00.200
Please, dear God!

2:57:02.120 --> 2:57:07.286
"He thrusts his fists against the posts,

2:57:07.440 --> 2:57:11.889
"and still insists he sees the ghosts."

2:57:30.800 --> 2:57:32.962
It's taking him. Bill!

2:57:38.640 --> 2:57:40.768
Come on, guys! We got to...

2:57:45.120 --> 2:57:47.805
Bev! Bev, where are you going? Bev...

2:57:51.320 --> 2:57:52.731
Bev...

2:57:52.880 --> 2:57:54.769
What am I going to do?

2:57:56.080 --> 2:57:58.401
This is battery acid, you slime!

2:58:10.920 --> 2:58:15.005
I believe in Santa Claus.
I believe in the Easter Bunny.

2:58:16.640 --> 2:58:18.483
I believe in the Tooth Fairy.

2:58:19.160 --> 2:58:20.605
But I don't believe in you.

2:58:22.160 --> 2:58:25.767
This is battery acid. Now you disappear.

2:58:44.440 --> 2:58:46.568
Please, God, don't let me miss again.

2:59:15.920 --> 2:59:17.490
Eddie? Eddie.

2:59:20.520 --> 2:59:22.010
Hey...

2:59:22.160 --> 2:59:23.525
Nice shot, Bev.

2:59:23.840 --> 2:59:26.844
Don't you talk. Don't talk.
You're gonna be fine, spaghetti man.

2:59:28.360 --> 2:59:30.010
Richie, please...

2:59:30.160 --> 2:59:33.164
For the last time, don't call me that.

2:59:35.600 --> 2:59:37.409
You know how I...

2:59:41.840 --> 2:59:43.046
Eddie.

2:59:46.760 --> 2:59:48.046
Eddie.

3:00:03.640 --> 3:00:05.210
This isn't over.

3:00:05.800 --> 3:00:08.041
If that thing comes back when I'm 70...

3:00:08.200 --> 3:00:10.407
Let's finish it. Once and for all.

3:01:19.960 --> 3:01:20.961
Audra.

3:01:34.320 --> 3:01:35.810
It's all coming down.

3:02:20.720 --> 3:02:22.529
<i>I guess that's how
I'd like to remember us,</i>

3:02:22.680 --> 3:02:24.011
<i>if I could remember us.</i>

3:02:24.200 --> 3:02:27.921
<i>Standing there by the lake
with the sun going down on our childhood.</i>

3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:31.363
<i>This will be my last entry.
I got it in just in time.</i>

3:02:31.520 --> 3:02:35.047
<i>Just before the fog in my brain
swept all of my memories away entirely.</i>

3:02:38.360 --> 3:02:40.488
<i>Now, just weeks later,
I look back on that time</i>

3:02:40.640 --> 3:02:43.325
<i>not from memory,
but from the pages of this book.</i>

3:02:43.480 --> 3:02:44.720
<i>The nightmare is over.</i>

3:02:44.880 --> 3:02:47.850
<i>What little police involvement there was
was brief and cursory.</i>

3:02:48.000 --> 3:02:50.048
<i>As is always the case here in Derry.</i>

3:02:51.120 --> 3:02:53.600
<i>Now that there's no further need
for a lighthouse keeper...</i>

3:02:53.760 --> 3:02:57.446
<i>Well, I feel I may move on,
see whatever's down the road apiece.</i>

3:02:58.400 --> 3:03:01.165
<i>As of this writing,
Richie's still knocking them dead.</i>

3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:02.407
<i>He's got a part in a movie.</i>

3:03:03.480 --> 3:03:05.448
574. Take 18, mark.

3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:07.011
<i>He costars with another comic,</i>

3:03:07.200 --> 3:03:09.248
<i>a guy any of the lucky seven
could have told you</i>

3:03:09.400 --> 3:03:11.402
<i>looks and acts a lot like Eddie Kaspbrak.</i>

3:03:14.800 --> 3:03:15.881
<i>And cut.</i>

3:03:17.200 --> 3:03:19.885
<i>Ben and Bev left Derry together,
headed west.</i>

3:03:20.040 --> 3:03:23.328
<i>After a week, they were married.
A few weeks later, they were pregnant.</i>

3:03:23.480 --> 3:03:25.084
<i>Another curse broken.</i>

3:03:31.680 --> 3:03:34.763
<i>Bill and Audra are still here.
I wish the news were better.</i>

3:03:34.920 --> 3:03:38.561
<i>But Audra's condition is unchanged.
They're leaving today.</i>

3:03:40.640 --> 3:03:42.927
Okay, Audra. It's time to go.

3:03:43.080 --> 3:03:45.082
<i>Bill thought the time here,
the time away from his work,</i>

3:03:45.280 --> 3:03:46.486
<i>might somehow help.</i>

3:03:46.800 --> 3:03:50.646
<i>But I guess Audra's gone for good.
One of It's many casualties.</i>

3:03:51.120 --> 3:03:54.567
<i>Locked in that haunted place
where she saw Its deadlights.</i>

3:03:54.720 --> 3:03:58.611
<i>Bill has been good to visit every day.
We laugh about our failing memories.</i>

3:03:59.080 --> 3:04:01.048
<i>We sometimes have to ask
each other's names now.</i>

3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:05.561
<i>His sadness is profound.
I wish there was something I could do.</i>

3:04:05.760 --> 3:04:07.524
<i>Something I could have done.</i>

3:04:15.680 --> 3:04:18.604
<i>Hi yo, Silver. Away!</i>

3:04:19.600 --> 3:04:20.681
Wait.

3:04:23.120 --> 3:04:28.809
Audra, this bike saved
little Stan's life once. Mine, too.

3:04:29.160 --> 3:04:31.481
We were going so fast,
I think we beat the devil.

3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:34.846
I don't know if I can go that fast again.

3:04:35.280 --> 3:04:36.486
Hold on.

3:04:50.840 --> 3:04:51.841
Beat it.

3:04:52.200 --> 3:04:54.407
Beat it. Beat it. Beat it, Audra.

3:04:54.600 --> 3:04:57.126
Beat it. Beat it.

3:05:05.640 --> 3:05:07.369
Come on. Come on.

3:05:21.520 --> 3:05:22.726
- Bill?
- Yes.

3:05:22.920 --> 3:05:25.048
- Bill, where are we? What are we doing?
- Yes, it's okay.

3:05:25.200 --> 3:05:26.406
It's okay. Hang on.

3:05:26.560 --> 3:05:28.050
Just hang on, babe, it's okay.
