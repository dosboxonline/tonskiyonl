01:34.052 --> 01:37.346
Losing Diana was like
losing a part of me.

01:39.182 --> 01:43.185
I thought nothing could change
the way we felt about each other.

01:44.020 --> 01:46.230
I thought we were invincible.

01:48.316 --> 01:51.610
Someone once said,
if you want something very badly,

01:51.695 --> 01:53.570
set it free.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.699
If it comes back to you,
it's yours forever.

01:57.992 --> 02:01.120
If it doesn't,
it was never yours to begin with.

02:03.665 --> 02:07.501
I knew one thing,
I was David's to begin with.

02:07.585 --> 02:09.211
And he was mine.

02:10.295 --> 02:15.926
You light up my life, you give...

02:16.011 --> 02:17.553
We met in high school.

02:17.637 --> 02:20.347
David was a senior
and I was a freshman.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.974
On Wednesdays, after glee club,

02:22.058 --> 02:25.144
he'd drive me and my best friend home
from school.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.521
I used to watch him
in the rear view mirror.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.357
I fell in love with his eyes.

02:36.865 --> 02:40.868
When I was 19, David proposed to me
on the pier at Paradise Cove.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.328
Our parents were against it.

02:43.413 --> 02:47.416
They said we were too young
and we really didn't know each other.

02:47.709 --> 02:51.587
But David said that
a life without risk is like no life at all.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.006
So we eloped.

03:12.275 --> 03:16.445
I graduated from architecture school
and got a job at a small firm.

03:17.072 --> 03:20.157
Diana helped support us
by selling real estate.

03:21.201 --> 03:25.120
I spent all of my free time
working on a design of my own.

03:25.205 --> 03:26.872
It summed up everything
about architecture

03:26.956 --> 03:29.124
that really mattered to me.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.085
It was my dream house.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.411
D.

04:08.581 --> 04:10.958
Have I ever told you I love you?

04:13.003 --> 04:14.044
No.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.629
I do.

04:15.964 --> 04:17.172
Still?

04:18.173 --> 04:19.425
Always.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.471
We had our differences.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.057
He used to take his clothes off
and leave them on the floor.

04:27.142 --> 04:28.809
It made me crazy.

04:50.874 --> 04:54.126
What do you think this is, huh?
Leaving your shoes on the table?

04:54.210 --> 04:56.545
-What is the problem here?
-I don't need to do your fucking laundry!

04:56.629 --> 04:57.629
Honey, I'll pick it up.

04:57.714 --> 04:59.590
-You don't have to get violent on me.
-What about this, huh?

04:59.674 --> 05:01.633
-No, no. You put that down, honey.
-Peanut butter sandwich...

05:01.718 --> 05:03.344
That is serious.
You're gonna hurt somebody with that.

05:03.428 --> 05:04.762
I'm gonna hurt somebody, huh?

05:04.846 --> 05:06.805
You're out of your mind.

05:07.265 --> 05:08.891
Okay, now. Fine.

05:12.395 --> 05:13.812
God damn it!

05:15.190 --> 05:17.232
Come on, let's just relax.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.276
Did I hurt you?

05:19.361 --> 05:21.320
-No. I'm all right.
-I'm sorry.

05:21.404 --> 05:22.988
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.531
You were kidding?

06:06.449 --> 06:08.826
D, your pants are on fire.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.121
You have no idea.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.931
We never had much money,
so for entertainment

06:31.016 --> 06:33.892
David would show me architecture
that moved him.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.894
But sometimes I'd have to ask,

06:35.979 --> 06:38.814
"Why are we looking
at a stupid car wash?"

06:38.898 --> 06:42.234
And he would just say, "No, not stupid.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.945
"Don't just use your eyes."

06:45.030 --> 06:47.698
He made me look at things differently.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.869
David, this is a steal.
It just came in to the office

06:51.953 --> 06:53.662
and nobody even knows about it yet.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.830
It's beautiful.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.958
You could build a house here.
You'll have made a name for yourself,

06:58.043 --> 06:59.710
because of course,
the house would be brilliant.

06:59.794 --> 07:01.712
Because it would be
a David Murphy house.

07:01.796 --> 07:06.175
I found an incredible piece of property
in Santa Monica by the ocean.

07:06.259 --> 07:08.010
It was the perfect site for David's house.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.094
How are we supposed to do it?

07:09.179 --> 07:10.929
We'll borrow the money
like everybody else.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.807
I'm telling you, these leverage
stock broker buyout guys,

07:13.892 --> 07:15.267
you should see the junk they buy.
Are you kidding?

07:15.352 --> 07:18.103
They would go crazy
for a house of yours.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.606
It was brilliant,

07:20.690 --> 07:23.525
even though I didn't
understand a word of it.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.819
We had to tighten our belts
for the loan payments,

07:25.904 --> 07:29.198
but it was our future.
And I got to build my house.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.913
And then the recession hit.

07:36.373 --> 07:40.834
The real estate market dried up
and I hadn't closed a sale in six months.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.338
Construction fell
to its lowest point in years.

07:44.422 --> 07:47.633
People were being laid off everywhere.
And I was one of them.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.468
I feel really bad about this.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.970
I don't understand. What happened?

07:52.055 --> 07:54.973
The bank has called in
the demand note.

07:55.058 --> 07:56.642
Can they do that?

07:56.726 --> 08:01.063
You don't have any income right now,
so they could attach your assets.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.566
What assets?

08:07.362 --> 08:08.737
Your house.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.366
You got to keep up those payments.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.035
I'm sorry.

08:28.425 --> 08:30.092
David, I'm scared.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.140
We don't have any money.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.643
What are we gonna do?

08:43.440 --> 08:46.775
I'll wait tables
or drive a cab or something.

08:55.827 --> 08:59.288
Hey, I'll take care of you.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.959
Make it go away.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.054
I was desperate.
We stood to lose everything.

09:15.138 --> 09:18.223
The house I'd been building,
even our own home.

09:18.850 --> 09:22.436
I swallowed my pride
and borrowed $5,000 from my father.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.646
It wasn't enough.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.691
We needed $50,000.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.331
-D. D, D.
-What?

09:42.749 --> 09:43.999
-Get up, get dressed.
-What's the matter?

09:44.084 --> 09:46.335
-I got an idea. Come on.
-What?

09:46.419 --> 09:48.087
-What time is it?
-Chop chop.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.823
Hi, how you doing? Okay.

10:15.907 --> 10:18.450
Cigars. Cigarettes. Lighted yo-yos.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.831
-Oh, yeah!
-Oh, my God!

10:24.582 --> 10:27.501
Oh, honey. That's the spirit!
Keep them coming.

10:27.585 --> 10:30.713
$50,000, that's what we want.
We're winners!

10:38.179 --> 10:41.849
Boom, skinny, skinny!
Put some money in the kitty.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.060
Eleven. Winner.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.563
We got a shooter now, folks.
We got a shooter.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.273
A lucky, lucky lady shooter.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.608
Keep it coming. Stack it, don't rack it!

10:54.362 --> 10:58.365
If I haven't gotten nine,
Denzel Washington ain't fine.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.035
Hard six! Hard six!

11:01.119 --> 11:03.579
-All bets set, folks.
-Who's the one?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.684
And I have a necklace...

12:51.730 --> 12:53.689
Why don't you put it on?

12:54.733 --> 12:56.191
It suits you.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.404
Well, I can't afford it.

13:02.032 --> 13:03.574
That's too bad.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.534
Yep.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.000
I really think
you ought to have the dress.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.544
Let me buy it for you.

13:16.296 --> 13:19.340
-You want to buy me this dress?
-Yeah.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.927
-Why?
-I've enjoyed watching you.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.097
You've earned it.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.101
No, I haven't.

13:34.064 --> 13:36.648
The dress is for sale. I'm not.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.322
Boom, skinny, skinny!

13:45.492 --> 13:47.159
Pull in that. Pull in that stack.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.994
We got a new shooter, now.
Coming out.

13:49.079 --> 13:50.746
Coming out to seven or eleven.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.873
Roll them now, girlfriends.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.333
Seven!

14:02.717 --> 14:04.551
Come on now! Come on.

14:04.969 --> 14:08.138
-I can't lose. I'm up over $9,000.
-Oh, my God!

14:08.223 --> 14:09.932
I can't believe it!

14:16.272 --> 14:17.981
-$9,000.
-My God, it's so great!

14:18.066 --> 14:20.192
This is my wife D. These are my girls.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.444
They're gonna be moving in. All right.

14:22.529 --> 14:24.613
Come on. Kiss them.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.201
Bets, please.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.912
'Cause we're winners!

14:32.414 --> 14:34.790
Boom, skinny, skinny!

14:43.008 --> 14:44.341
Did I ever tell you I love you?

14:44.426 --> 14:45.551
-No.
-I do.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.177
-Still?
-Always.

15:07.741 --> 15:11.910
Five thousand.
This little pile here, you guessed it.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.746
Five more, D.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.582
What do you think this is? Five more.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.877
Play with it,
roll around with it, enjoy yourself.

15:20.337 --> 15:21.587
Oh, my!

15:24.299 --> 15:27.009
And the grand total is...

15:29.929 --> 15:33.098
$25,040.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.894
So, we're half-way there, like in an hour.

15:37.354 --> 15:41.357
I figure about two hours tomorrow,

15:41.858 --> 15:44.193
-we'll be home free.
-Come here.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.044
What?

16:06.883 --> 16:08.217
I love you.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.681
I know that.

16:14.808 --> 16:17.851
No, I mean, even without the money.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.100
Let's split the three and the six for me.

17:43.480 --> 17:46.357
-That's right. Why don't you split them?
-Fifteen.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.487
Last call for wagers. No more bets.

17:56.242 --> 17:59.119
Come on, black. Come on, black.
Here we go.

18:00.830 --> 18:01.914
Yes!

18:11.007 --> 18:12.383
Double zero.

18:13.385 --> 18:15.219
No more bets, please.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.058
Come on, black. Here we go.

18:22.686 --> 18:24.103
Yes, we won!

18:50.505 --> 18:53.465
$4,1 00, we said
we wouldn't go below $5,000.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.718
Do you want any more coffee?

18:56.052 --> 18:57.553
No, thank you.

19:14.571 --> 19:17.156
Tails, we quit. Heads, we go for it.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.469
Two out of three.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.972
Last call for wagers.

19:43.433 --> 19:45.184
No more bets.

19:45.268 --> 19:48.437
Okay. I'm feeling lucky.
I say we put it on red.

19:49.606 --> 19:51.148
All of it. Red.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.943
I feel red. Do you feel red, D?

19:56.196 --> 19:59.114
We can do this, huh? D?

20:00.867 --> 20:02.701
I'm gonna put it all.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.538
I'm putting it on red.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.458
Okay.

20:30.772 --> 20:33.148
-No, it's black! It's black.
-What are you doing?

20:33.233 --> 20:35.609
-It's black.
-What are you doing?

20:39.989 --> 20:42.116
No, no, it's red. It's red.

20:42.409 --> 20:44.410
Go with your instincts. Right?

20:44.494 --> 20:47.538
-No more bets.
-Oh, come on, man. Come on, red.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.710
Got to get it. Got to get it.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.171
Come on, red. Come on, red.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.641
Too late, young lady.

21:45.764 --> 21:48.515
Place your bets. Bank side, player side.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.143
All set? Cards, please.

21:54.606 --> 21:56.607
Turning for the players.

21:57.150 --> 21:59.276
Passes to the right, please.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.200
Player draws nothing.

22:15.502 --> 22:16.752
And set.

22:18.713 --> 22:20.756
Player side, banker side.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.842
-Any other bets?
-Who's that guy?

22:23.927 --> 22:25.594
That's John Gage.

22:26.554 --> 22:30.182
He's a damn billionaire.
That's a rich son-of-a-bitch, right there.

22:30.266 --> 22:32.935
He's down over
a million dollars already.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.688
You see those little gold things
he's playing with?

22:35.772 --> 22:37.398
$1 0,000 a piece.

22:38.108 --> 22:41.485
Every time he lays one down,
ten thousand big ones.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.278
Look at him, how cool he is.

22:43.363 --> 22:44.571
That son-of-a-bitch
must get more pussy

22:44.656 --> 22:46.073
than you can shake a stick at.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.866
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you or anything.

22:47.951 --> 22:49.201
-Player wins.
-What are y'all doing here?

22:49.285 --> 22:50.661
-You gambling?
-No.

22:50.745 --> 22:52.579
It's about time.

22:52.664 --> 22:53.664
Y'all married?

22:53.748 --> 22:55.207
-Let's go.
-Yeah.

22:55.291 --> 22:56.417
Stick around and gamble a little.

22:56.501 --> 22:59.336
Excuse me. Excuse me.

23:01.339 --> 23:03.882
Would you mind lending me your wife?

23:03.967 --> 23:05.551
Is that your wife?

23:05.635 --> 23:06.969
Excuse me?

23:08.972 --> 23:10.222
For luck.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.308
You'd have to ask her.

23:14.644 --> 23:15.811
May I?

23:17.814 --> 23:19.356
-Go for it.
-I don't think it's a good idea.

23:19.441 --> 23:20.649
I think we should just go.

23:20.734 --> 23:22.234
Just for a moment?

23:22.318 --> 23:24.737
-I'll go.
-Go ahead. It might be fun.

23:24.946 --> 23:26.822
What do we got to lose?

23:27.157 --> 23:28.157
Well?

23:28.241 --> 23:29.825
Why don't you go in
and see what happens?

23:29.909 --> 23:31.326
Yeah. Go ahead.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.829
We'll be right here backing you up.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.581
Thank you.

23:35.665 --> 23:39.126
See if you can get a little
of that money from him.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.754
Do you think she'll ever come back?

23:42.464 --> 23:45.007
I'm just bullshitting you.

23:47.177 --> 23:48.552
Have a seat.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.262
I've been losing all day long.

23:50.347 --> 23:51.972
Then you appeared
and I won my first hand.

23:52.057 --> 23:53.849
You brought me luck.

23:54.726 --> 23:58.312
I'd say that's a sign. Wouldn't you?

24:02.150 --> 24:04.860
-Would you like a drink?
-No, thank you.

24:05.153 --> 24:06.362
Candy?

24:10.200 --> 24:11.784
Place your bets.

24:11.993 --> 24:13.869
-Bank side, player side.
-$1 00,000.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.537
Any other bets?

24:16.122 --> 24:19.124
-Just like that?
-Just like that.

24:19.209 --> 24:20.584
All bets set.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.003
$20 tie-in.

24:25.799 --> 24:27.341
Not like that.

24:28.259 --> 24:29.468
Sorry.

24:32.722 --> 24:35.224
All bets set. Cards, please.

24:39.062 --> 24:42.147
-Turning for the players.
-Now, what we want...

24:43.066 --> 24:46.151
What we need is a nine.

24:53.743 --> 24:55.536
We don't like that.

24:55.620 --> 24:58.747
Player draws nothing.
Cards for the bank, please.

24:58.832 --> 25:02.084
Bank's a winner with a natural eight.
Pay the bank.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.340
I guess I'm not so lucky after all.

25:08.425 --> 25:10.092
Do you like cards?

25:11.094 --> 25:12.594
Not especially.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.847
Wish I'd asked you sooner.

25:14.931 --> 25:16.056
Dice?

25:17.267 --> 25:18.809
Yeah, I guess.

25:22.355 --> 25:23.564
Sam.

25:24.441 --> 25:25.649
Mr. G?

25:28.069 --> 25:29.153
One.

25:29.821 --> 25:31.488
Excuse me, Mr. G.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.042
Well, maybe I should go.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.251
This shouldn't take too long.
Here we go.

25:44.336 --> 25:46.253
-What?
-This.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.137
Now,

25:56.765 --> 25:59.183
I hope you find this interesting.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.477
Pit. Tadross.

26:02.187 --> 26:05.314
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, it's here now.

26:06.066 --> 26:07.358
Yes, sir.

26:11.988 --> 26:13.489
I understand.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.909
Yes, sir. Thank you.

26:16.993 --> 26:18.744
Goes for $1 million.

26:18.828 --> 26:20.245
It's a bet.

26:24.292 --> 26:26.627
Here you are, Mr. G, $1 million.

26:54.406 --> 26:55.823
Bet it all.

27:17.178 --> 27:20.889
Coming out. Crap eleven or any seven.
This time it is a come out roll.

27:20.974 --> 27:23.017
Hone those skills now. Get them down.

27:23.101 --> 27:24.393
Pick two.

27:32.068 --> 27:34.028
Now, just throw a seven.

27:34.571 --> 27:38.032
If you want to throw an eleven,
that's all right, too.

27:43.455 --> 27:45.789
Aren't you forgetting something?

28:05.977 --> 28:07.186
Seven!

28:16.279 --> 28:19.615
The winner is seven. Everyone.

28:22.035 --> 28:24.078
Think I ought to quit now?

28:24.537 --> 28:26.205
I think I should.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.084
Credit my account.

28:30.710 --> 28:32.711
Excuse me. Excuse me.

28:32.796 --> 28:35.881
Sweetie, it was amazing.
Incredible. Oh, my God.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.383
Unbelievable.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.843
Hi. John Gage.

28:39.969 --> 28:42.471
-Oh, hi. David Murphy.
-Hi, David.

28:42.806 --> 28:46.308
Congratulations. This is my wife, Diana.
I guess you met.

28:46.393 --> 28:48.560
-Hi, Diana? Hi.
-Diana.

28:49.479 --> 28:51.480
Thank you, both.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.941
Very generous of you, David.
Are you staying at the hotel?

28:54.025 --> 28:55.776
Oh, no. Actually, we were just leaving.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.236
-You're leaving?
-Yes, we're on our way out.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.655
No, no, no, no. Don't do that.
We got to celebrate.

28:59.739 --> 29:01.949
Let me arrange a room for you here.

29:02.242 --> 29:04.743
-That's very nice, but...
-No, I... I insist.

29:04.828 --> 29:07.746
Please. It's the least I can do. Okay?

29:07.831 --> 29:10.791
Really, just sign for it.
Anything you want.

29:11.126 --> 29:14.878
There's some lovely shops off the lobby.
Have you seen them?

29:18.008 --> 29:19.258
Let's go.

29:31.021 --> 29:32.604
How about that?

29:36.651 --> 29:37.693
Wow.

29:38.862 --> 29:42.614
Hey, D, what do you think? Godfather?

29:48.830 --> 29:51.206
You won a million dollars today.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.500
He won it.

29:53.585 --> 29:55.669
Honey, you won it for him.

30:03.553 --> 30:05.137
This feels nice.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.475
Don't get it. Just stay right here.

30:09.559 --> 30:10.934
-Okay.
-Okay.

30:20.487 --> 30:22.613
Hello. William Shackleford.

30:22.697 --> 30:24.323
Hi. David Murphy.

30:26.493 --> 30:29.203
For Mrs. Murphy, from John Gage.

30:31.206 --> 30:33.499
-Well, thank him for us.
-I'll do that.

30:33.583 --> 30:37.044
Mr. Gage is hosting a gathering tonight
in his suite at 9:00.

30:37.128 --> 30:38.671
If you could find the time
in your schedule,

30:38.755 --> 30:40.589
he'd be most pleased.

30:43.426 --> 30:45.469
-Look what you got.
-What?

30:46.513 --> 30:48.138
A gift from Gage.

30:49.933 --> 30:51.100
Really?

30:52.435 --> 30:54.103
Well, open it up.

31:05.699 --> 31:07.241
That's $5,000.

31:08.660 --> 31:10.494
How do you know that?

31:11.454 --> 31:14.123
I... I saw it in the store downstairs.

31:16.543 --> 31:19.962
-Lucky for him you like black.
-Yeah.

32:54.432 --> 32:57.559
No past, no future, you just check into
a hotel and start all over again.

32:59.646 --> 33:03.107
I'd stick them under the sheets...

33:04.192 --> 33:06.276
That's strange, am I right?

33:28.425 --> 33:30.551
Who is that guy, Shackleford?

33:31.594 --> 33:35.639
Someone who works for me.
Someone I trust.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.104
He killed someone once.

33:46.192 --> 33:50.612
Tell me, where do you see yourself
in, say, ten years?

33:53.241 --> 33:56.827
Well, I wouldn't mind
being a billionaire like yourself.

33:57.829 --> 33:59.872
No... Nice shot. I mean, beyond money.

33:59.956 --> 34:03.667
What would satisfy you completely,
let you sleep well at night?

34:03.752 --> 34:06.712
What, are you saying
you're not satisfied?

34:06.796 --> 34:08.047
Who is?

34:09.299 --> 34:10.424
I am.

34:13.803 --> 34:15.179
She mean it?

34:16.556 --> 34:17.931
I hope so.

34:18.600 --> 34:20.893
Well, then,
you may not have won in Vegas,

34:20.976 --> 34:21.976
but you're a lucky man.

34:22.062 --> 34:25.522
'Cause I got money. I got security.
I have businesses,

34:25.607 --> 34:28.025
but you have something
that I just don't have.

34:28.109 --> 34:31.402
Well, I guess there's limits
to what money can buy.

34:32.155 --> 34:33.447
Not many.

34:34.824 --> 34:37.284
Well, some things aren't for sale.

34:38.453 --> 34:39.703
Such as?

34:40.955 --> 34:43.040
Well, you can't buy people.

34:44.668 --> 34:47.460
That's naive, Diana.
I buy people every day.

34:47.545 --> 34:48.754
Well, in business, maybe,

34:48.838 --> 34:51.547
but not when real emotions
are involved.

34:51.925 --> 34:53.384
So, what are you saying?
You can't buy love?

34:53.467 --> 34:56.344
That's a bit of a cliché, don't you think?

34:56.679 --> 34:58.514
It's absolutely true.

34:58.890 --> 35:00.891
Is it? What do you think?

35:02.018 --> 35:04.186
-I agree with Diana.
-You do?

35:06.648 --> 35:08.816
Well, let's test the cliché.

35:12.696 --> 35:18.117
Suppose I were to offer you $1 million

35:21.246 --> 35:23.414
for one night with your wife.

35:29.045 --> 35:31.130
I'd assume you're kidding.

35:31.798 --> 35:35.300
Let's pretend I'm not.
What would you say?

35:39.014 --> 35:41.140
He'd tell you to go to hell.

35:42.892 --> 35:44.601
I didn't hear him.

35:46.062 --> 35:48.188
I'd tell you to go to hell.

36:00.869 --> 36:04.204
That's a reflex answer
because you view it as hypothetical.

36:04.289 --> 36:07.666
But let's say that
there were real money behind it.

36:09.294 --> 36:12.504
I'm not kidding. A million dollars.

36:13.673 --> 36:17.676
Now, the night would come and go,
but the money could last a lifetime.

36:17.761 --> 36:21.680
Think of it. A million dollars.

36:23.933 --> 36:27.936
A lifetime of security, for one night.

36:29.814 --> 36:33.317
And don't answer right away.
But consider it.

36:34.903 --> 36:36.278
Seriously.

36:37.947 --> 36:39.782
We're positive, okay?

36:44.162 --> 36:46.080
Well, then,
you've answered my question.

36:46.164 --> 36:50.417
And you've proved your point.
There are limits to what money can buy.

36:50.960 --> 36:54.505
It's late, and I hate to admit it,
but I have a meeting.

36:55.173 --> 36:56.965
May I have one dance?

36:57.717 --> 37:00.094
Of course, with your permission.

37:00.428 --> 37:02.680
You know something,
I think you better get on to that meeting.

37:02.764 --> 37:05.891
You don't want to miss out
on your next billion.

37:06.476 --> 37:09.436
Understood.
I wouldn't part with her, either.

37:12.023 --> 37:13.357
Good night.

38:10.540 --> 38:11.957
Can't sleep?

38:14.919 --> 38:16.003
No.

38:18.256 --> 38:19.715
Me, neither.

38:26.389 --> 38:28.640
I just keep thinking about it.

38:31.770 --> 38:33.771
It's so weird, isn't it?

38:36.524 --> 38:37.608
Yeah.

38:44.115 --> 38:46.700
David, I think you want me to do it.

38:51.623 --> 38:56.001
What are you talking about?
Don't be ridiculous.

38:58.755 --> 39:01.006
Well, maybe we should
just talk about it.

39:01.091 --> 39:03.467
Well, I don't want you to do it.

39:09.933 --> 39:12.101
-But you'd let me do it.
-No.

39:18.233 --> 39:20.275
Why, do you want to do it?

39:22.779 --> 39:23.821
No.

39:26.825 --> 39:28.283
But I would.

39:29.744 --> 39:31.453
I'd do it for you.

39:33.873 --> 39:35.082
For me?

39:45.301 --> 39:48.303
I can't believe
we're even talking about this.

39:50.306 --> 39:52.641
Think about what this money
could do for us.

39:52.726 --> 39:55.102
What it could do for our future.

39:57.522 --> 40:02.693
You could finish your house.
You could pay your dad back.

40:03.737 --> 40:05.529
Get rid of our debt.

40:07.365 --> 40:09.992
After all, it wouldn't mean anything.

40:10.410 --> 40:15.289
It's just my body.
It's not my mind. It's not my heart.

40:18.501 --> 40:21.754
You think we could
do something like that?

40:29.095 --> 40:32.306
Look, we both slept with other people
before we were married, right?

40:32.390 --> 40:33.515
Yeah.

40:34.976 --> 40:37.770
So we'd just have to look at it like that.

40:42.233 --> 40:44.234
I slept with Bubba Aruzio,
for God's sake.

40:44.319 --> 40:45.778
If I can sleep with Bubba,
I can sleep with anybody.

40:45.862 --> 40:47.654
You slept with Bubba?

40:48.615 --> 40:50.282
-Come on, you knew.
-No, I didn't know that.

40:50.367 --> 40:52.659
When did you sleep with Bubba?

40:53.578 --> 40:57.122
When you were off
sleeping with that slut Olivia Daigle.

40:57.248 --> 41:01.168
-Olivia Deagle. She wasn't a slut.
-Oh, excuse me. Olivia Beagle.

41:01.252 --> 41:04.421
I'm telling you. She wasn't a slut.

41:04.506 --> 41:08.092
-Yes, she was.
-No, she wasn't.

41:08.593 --> 41:10.135
Unfortunately.

41:14.182 --> 41:16.517
Thank God we can laugh about it.

41:17.602 --> 41:19.478
Yeah.

41:19.562 --> 41:22.106
That's easy to say now. But after...

41:27.612 --> 41:30.447
We'd just have to
forget it ever happened.

41:33.743 --> 41:36.286
And never discuss it. Not even once.

41:40.041 --> 41:42.960
I mean, because nothing
would have happened.

41:45.171 --> 41:47.381
Nothing that matters, anyway.

41:56.975 --> 41:59.393
We have a brilliant script,
really, very special.

41:59.477 --> 42:01.437
-Major.
-It's a vehicle,

42:01.521 --> 42:04.398
-a comeback vehicle for Diana Ross.
-Billy Ray Cyrus.

42:04.482 --> 42:07.192
-It's kind ofA Star is Born.
-So...

42:07.736 --> 42:09.361
Your first screenplay
sold for half a million.

42:09.446 --> 42:10.904
-Should have been two.
-Yeah, except our lawyer,

42:10.989 --> 42:12.364
son-of-a-bitch, caved in on us.

42:12.449 --> 42:13.574
-That won't happen again.
-No.

42:13.658 --> 42:16.076
See, we're gonna get a lawyer
that's tough, a lawyer that's savvy...

42:16.161 --> 42:19.371
Someone who would
step on his grandmother for us.

42:20.582 --> 42:22.583
Mr. Green, a David Murphy
would like to speak to you.

42:22.667 --> 42:24.251
He says it's urgent.

42:24.919 --> 42:25.919
Put him on the speaker.

42:26.004 --> 42:28.881
This is an old college buddy of mine.
It'll only take a second.

42:28.965 --> 42:30.382
-Jeremy?
-Davey.

42:30.467 --> 42:32.176
I'm in the middle of a meeting.
What's up?

42:32.260 --> 42:34.678
Well, listen,
we need you to close a deal.

42:34.763 --> 42:37.639
-What kind of deal?
-A big deal, a very big deal.

42:37.724 --> 42:39.308
Big deal. Go on.

42:39.392 --> 42:42.019
We're in Vegas, at the Hilton.

42:42.103 --> 42:44.688
We met John Gage.
You know who he is?

42:44.773 --> 42:46.732
Sure, I know who he is.
He's a billionaire,

42:46.816 --> 42:48.859
and a major poon hound.

42:50.362 --> 42:51.528
He is?

42:51.821 --> 42:52.946
Go on.

42:53.031 --> 42:55.324
He offered us a million dollars.

42:55.408 --> 42:58.911
A million dollars?
For what? Your kidneys?

43:00.705 --> 43:02.748
For one night with Diana.

43:06.461 --> 43:09.755
What do you mean? One night, like...

43:09.839 --> 43:10.923
Yes.

43:14.260 --> 43:16.679
Could you excuse me for a second?

43:22.394 --> 43:24.436
Let me get this straight.

43:25.063 --> 43:27.564
He offered you a million dollars
for a night with your wife?

43:27.649 --> 43:29.566
As in your wife, Diana?

43:30.276 --> 43:31.777
And you agreed to it?

43:31.861 --> 43:35.280
I don't know what to say, man.
How could you do something like that?

43:35.365 --> 43:37.282
How could you negotiate without me?

43:37.367 --> 43:40.119
Never negotiate
without your lawyer! Never!

43:40.203 --> 43:44.331
For a woman like Diana,
I could have got you at least two million!

43:44.541 --> 43:47.960
Obviously! You don't want
to get screwed, and then screwed.

43:48.044 --> 43:50.796
Hey, stay. Please.
This is damage control.

43:50.880 --> 43:52.006
Two seconds. Eat cookies.

43:52.090 --> 43:53.549
-There's cookies coming.
-No. You don't understand.

43:53.633 --> 43:54.967
-We've heard enough.
-You're hired.

43:55.051 --> 43:56.760
You are. You're our man.
We love your style.

43:56.845 --> 43:57.845
-Great.
-Thank you.

43:57.929 --> 43:59.471
Gladys, check
the gentlemen's schedules.

43:59.556 --> 44:01.306
And call me next week.
Wednesday? Wednesday good?

44:01.391 --> 44:02.933
-Great. Okay.
-See you then.

44:03.018 --> 44:04.184
-Thanks for coming.
-No, thank you.

44:04.269 --> 44:06.353
-No, thank you.
-Thank you.

44:06.980 --> 44:10.441
Okay, David,
before we go any further, let's...

44:11.609 --> 44:13.944
Let's get the moral issue out of the way.

44:14.029 --> 44:16.155
-Leave that to us.
-No, I was referring to my fee.

44:16.239 --> 44:17.990
I get five percent.

44:19.826 --> 44:22.828
Do you want to elaborate
on the verification clause?

44:22.912 --> 44:24.538
Verification...

44:24.622 --> 44:28.500
That means you pay even if
the relationship isn't consummated.

44:29.252 --> 44:31.253
You mean if I'm impotent.

44:32.630 --> 44:35.924
It's important for a lawyer
to cover contingencies.

44:36.593 --> 44:39.678
I can live with that.
The John Garfield clause?

44:39.929 --> 44:42.139
That's if you die in the act.

44:46.102 --> 44:49.730
I have no problem with that, either.
Can I have your pen?

44:56.988 --> 44:59.823
-You're pretty good, you know?
-Thank you.

45:00.241 --> 45:02.368
You should come work for me.

45:13.755 --> 45:15.297
We have a deal.

45:19.761 --> 45:24.306
A million dollars will be deposited
in your casino account in the morning.

45:29.979 --> 45:36.610
So...

45:39.698 --> 45:41.115
You can go.

45:41.783 --> 45:44.410
Gentlemen, I think it's time
for men of good will

45:44.494 --> 45:47.705
to take leave of one another.

46:14.566 --> 46:17.693
It's all right. I don't bite.

46:21.114 --> 46:22.239
So...

46:24.367 --> 46:26.410
What, should I go undress?

46:31.708 --> 46:33.709
You know, cheer up.
You got to find a more creative way

46:33.793 --> 46:34.793
to think about this, okay?

46:34.878 --> 46:36.628
Just look at it like an episode
of The Dating Game

46:36.713 --> 46:39.631
that went a little bit, you know,
awry or something like that.

46:39.716 --> 46:42.301
Ladies and gentlemen,

46:42.385 --> 46:46.722
we wish to welcome you
to ourjamboree.

46:46.806 --> 46:50.809
...I couldn't believe it.
I know we could've gotten two million.

46:51.728 --> 46:52.895
Here's your Buddha.

46:52.979 --> 46:55.898
Davey, no point
getting out the crying towel.

46:55.982 --> 46:59.360
You got a million bucks, buddy.
A million bucks.

47:02.906 --> 47:05.824
She's an amazing woman. She really is.

47:05.909 --> 47:07.868
Couldn't have gotten $500
for my girlfriend.

47:07.952 --> 47:09.912
Not that I'd do that.

47:10.455 --> 47:12.623
But it's okay that you did.

47:12.707 --> 47:15.376
This is a different situation
and she agreed to it.

47:15.460 --> 47:17.044
You got to remember that.

47:17.128 --> 47:19.546
And it's not like it's hard duty
or anything like that.

47:19.631 --> 47:21.590
Hell, he's a great looking guy.

47:21.675 --> 47:24.677
For a million bucks, I'd sleep with him.

47:25.929 --> 47:27.262
Maybe not.

47:28.932 --> 47:30.307
Hey, buddy!

47:42.612 --> 47:43.862
Come on!

47:52.622 --> 47:56.125
Come on. Come on.

47:57.460 --> 48:00.421
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

48:13.601 --> 48:16.145
D? It's me.

48:17.605 --> 48:21.483
D! D!

48:24.070 --> 48:26.321
Where is she? Where's my wife?

48:28.575 --> 48:30.034
Where is she?

48:33.329 --> 48:34.788
Diana!

48:35.874 --> 48:37.207
Please!

48:37.292 --> 48:38.917
Where did she go?
What happened to her?

48:39.002 --> 48:40.753
-Where'd they go?
-Up. Up.

48:40.837 --> 48:42.838
-Up! Up where?
-Up.

48:43.214 --> 48:44.631
Helicopter.

49:04.194 --> 49:09.531
D!

49:11.117 --> 49:14.411
D! D!

49:19.334 --> 49:20.626
D!

53:38.134 --> 53:41.637
They sent for me.
They said you were ready.

53:55.652 --> 53:57.027
Come here.

54:19.843 --> 54:21.635
You missed a button.

54:29.519 --> 54:30.894
Thank you.

54:33.106 --> 54:35.315
I want to show you something.

54:51.541 --> 54:53.083
What happened?

54:53.710 --> 54:55.502
The lights went out.

54:58.256 --> 55:00.215
I see that. Why?

55:04.471 --> 55:05.554
Look.

55:11.561 --> 55:13.729
Can you turn those off, too?

55:17.525 --> 55:19.234
I'm working on it.

55:24.949 --> 55:26.867
Who made the decision?

55:30.080 --> 55:33.040
-We both did.
-No.

55:34.751 --> 55:37.586
Do it for your own reasons,
or don't do it.

55:39.339 --> 55:40.631
You don't know him.

55:40.715 --> 55:42.758
I know he didn't stop you.

55:43.968 --> 55:45.594
If you were mine,

55:48.807 --> 55:51.266
I wouldn't share you with anyone.

55:57.232 --> 55:59.650
You have no right to judge David.

56:02.779 --> 56:05.322
You're the one who has to buy women.

56:05.782 --> 56:07.991
You think I have to buy women?

56:12.330 --> 56:14.373
Why me, then?

56:14.457 --> 56:17.835
I bought you because you said
you couldn't be bought.

56:19.546 --> 56:21.213
I can't be bought.

56:21.881 --> 56:24.633
We're just gonna fuck,
as I understand it.

56:26.302 --> 56:28.012
You might enjoy it.

56:29.472 --> 56:31.098
Don't bet on it.

56:35.145 --> 56:36.687
I think I will.

56:41.943 --> 56:43.444
Heads, we do.

56:43.903 --> 56:45.446
Tails, we call the whole thing off,

56:45.530 --> 56:48.657
turn the boat around, go home.
No hard feelings.

56:49.325 --> 56:50.951
What do you say?

56:53.038 --> 56:54.663
It's your party.

56:56.708 --> 56:58.542
It's my lucky dollar.

56:59.878 --> 57:01.503
So I can't lose.

57:23.693 --> 57:24.985
Trust me.

57:26.780 --> 57:29.490
Nothing's gonna happen
you don't choose.

59:43.667 --> 59:45.668
-I love you.
-I love you.

01:00:02.018 --> 01:00:04.019
I told myself it was over.

01:00:04.187 --> 01:00:06.939
Like a dream
that vanishes in the morning light.

01:00:07.023 --> 01:00:10.651
And in time, enough time,
I would forget.

01:00:25.917 --> 01:00:27.042
Yeah.

01:00:29.087 --> 01:00:30.421
All right.

01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:34.466
Yeah.

01:00:34.926 --> 01:00:36.927
Yeah, a little fixer-upper
south of Wilshire.

01:00:37.012 --> 01:00:38.679
It's nothing. Yeah.

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:42.558
Look, I've got people here.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:44.601
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

01:00:45.061 --> 01:00:47.479
Sorry, I'm here for you now.

01:00:48.189 --> 01:00:51.734
-All right. Two acres on Alta Loma...
-Alta Vista.

01:00:51.901 --> 01:00:54.778
Vista. It's right here. Murphy property.

01:00:55.447 --> 01:00:57.156
Yeah. We've been a little late
on the payments.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.033
We want to settle up.

01:00:59.117 --> 01:01:02.953
-I don't think that's possible.
-What do you mean?

01:01:03.038 --> 01:01:05.330
Well, the mortgage
is two months in default.

01:01:05.415 --> 01:01:09.585
And it appears that the property
is in contract to another party.

01:01:11.212 --> 01:01:14.423
-To another party? Who?
-That's privileged information.

01:01:14.507 --> 01:01:17.343
How can that be?
We called specifically for an extension.

01:01:17.427 --> 01:01:20.137
The extension expired two days ago.

01:01:20.221 --> 01:01:23.432
You don't make a payment,
the bank can repossess.

01:01:23.516 --> 01:01:26.226
Without prior notice? Can they do that?

01:01:26.853 --> 01:01:29.313
Under the terms of this agreement,
they don't have to give us a warning.

01:01:29.397 --> 01:01:32.483
But in fact, an attempt was made
to call you on the third,

01:01:32.567 --> 01:01:34.860
and a registered letter
return receipt requested,

01:01:34.944 --> 01:01:36.362
was attempted on the fourth.

01:01:36.446 --> 01:01:38.447
Apparently, there was no one home.

01:01:38.531 --> 01:01:40.240
-We were out of town.
-We were out of town.

01:01:40.325 --> 01:01:44.536
Well, I am sorry,
but you snooze, you lose.

01:01:46.623 --> 01:01:48.457
You snooze, you lose.

01:01:50.001 --> 01:01:52.461
-"You snooze, you lose"?
-It's an expression.

01:01:52.545 --> 01:01:54.672
You snooze, you lose.
Oh, that's beautiful.

01:01:54.756 --> 01:01:57.383
You snooze, you lose. That's bullshit!

01:02:00.178 --> 01:02:01.679
-This is bullshit, man.
-David...

01:02:01.763 --> 01:02:03.347
Hey, don't deal with these people.

01:02:03.431 --> 01:02:06.308
They sold us out,
they'll sell you out, too.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.024
Hey, want to help me in the garden?

01:02:56.693 --> 01:02:57.860
Okay.

01:03:07.328 --> 01:03:10.372
Our tomatoes are looking good,
don't you think?

01:03:12.959 --> 01:03:14.168
David?

01:03:17.464 --> 01:03:19.048
What's Gryphon?

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:22.051
Gryphon.

01:03:24.012 --> 01:03:26.263
Where did you hear that name?

01:03:27.515 --> 01:03:29.558
You have a box of matches.

01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:34.480
We said we wouldn't talk about it.

01:03:34.564 --> 01:03:37.358
Yeah, well, now I want to talk about it.

01:03:38.943 --> 01:03:41.945
-Don't you?
-No.

01:03:43.073 --> 01:03:49.203
D, I thought I could forget about this,
but I can't.

01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:56.168
So I think maybe if we just talk about it,
we can put it behind us.

01:04:03.385 --> 01:04:05.052
Gryphon is a boat.

01:04:06.429 --> 01:04:09.848
He took you to a boat? In Nevada?

01:04:10.308 --> 01:04:13.310
-We flew to Santa Barbara.
-What kind of boat?

01:04:13.436 --> 01:04:15.604
-A big boat.
-And then what?

01:04:16.231 --> 01:04:17.898
And then nothing.

01:04:20.819 --> 01:04:24.029
Where did you get the matches?
Have you been going through my bag?

01:04:24.114 --> 01:04:25.155
No.

01:04:28.743 --> 01:04:30.744
Why? What's in your bag?

01:04:31.329 --> 01:04:34.623
I'm not gonna talk about this.
I'm not gonna do it.

01:06:11.721 --> 01:06:12.888
What?

01:06:14.766 --> 01:06:16.517
Who you talking to?

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.894
My mother.

01:06:19.562 --> 01:06:22.189
And what did Mom have to say?

01:06:24.317 --> 01:06:26.402
Nothing. She wasn't there.

01:06:26.903 --> 01:06:28.404
I thought you said
you were just talking to her.

01:06:28.488 --> 01:06:30.906
How could you be talking to her
if she wasn't there?

01:06:30.990 --> 01:06:34.618
Well, I was trying to talk to her,
but I didn't reach her.

01:06:35.078 --> 01:06:37.663
-She wasn't in after 1 0:00?
-No. She's not.

01:06:37.747 --> 01:06:40.833
If you don't believe me,
would you like to talk to her yourself?

01:06:44.713 --> 01:06:46.839
What is the matter with you?

01:06:53.054 --> 01:06:55.597
-What is that?
-You know what it is.

01:06:59.853 --> 01:07:02.604
-Where did you get this?
-In your wallet.

01:07:03.273 --> 01:07:04.356
Well, I've never seen it before.

01:07:04.441 --> 01:07:06.692
Well, it was right there
in the old secret compartment.

01:07:06.776 --> 01:07:07.776
David, I don't even use that.

01:07:07.861 --> 01:07:09.445
-Have you been seeing him?
-No, I haven't.

01:07:09.529 --> 01:07:11.113
You can't stop thinking about him,
can you?

01:07:11.197 --> 01:07:14.033
-You won't let me.
-Can you, D?

01:07:14.117 --> 01:07:15.784
What are you doing
going through my wallet, anyway?

01:07:15.869 --> 01:07:16.994
-I don't trust you.
-Well, you know what?

01:07:17.078 --> 01:07:18.203
I don't trust you, either.

01:07:18.288 --> 01:07:20.205
Well, then we're even.

01:07:29.716 --> 01:07:31.592
I had to do something.

01:07:31.676 --> 01:07:34.720
I wanted to make something good
out of all we'd done wrong.

01:07:34.804 --> 01:07:37.431
I decided to try and buy our land back.

01:07:38.516 --> 01:07:40.684
Okay, Alta Vista...

01:07:41.353 --> 01:07:45.356
I just need to find out the guy's name.
I want to make him an offer.

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:47.900
I'll get killed for this, Diana.

01:07:47.984 --> 01:07:50.069
I don't want you to get in trouble.
I really appreciate it.

01:07:50.153 --> 01:07:53.364
-543, Alta Vista...
-Wait, there it is. There it is right there.

01:07:53.448 --> 01:07:54.907
-Okay. Okay.
-Back up.

01:07:54.991 --> 01:07:58.160
Here we go. 543 Alta Vista.

01:08:00.163 --> 01:08:02.748
Oh, my God, look at this.
This guy's never gonna sell, Diana.

01:08:02.832 --> 01:08:05.751
He's one of the...
I just saw this guy on TV.

01:08:22.519 --> 01:08:24.687
I'm not going back in there.

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:49.211
You bastard! You stole our property!

01:08:51.381 --> 01:08:53.131
Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce
a friend of mine...

01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:54.966
I'm not your friend.

01:08:55.260 --> 01:08:57.051
Diana advised me on a piece of property
in Santa Monica.

01:08:57.136 --> 01:08:59.930
That's bullshit. You're a liar.
You took it, and I want it back.

01:09:00.015 --> 01:09:02.057
I tell you what, can we have a...
Excuse me. That's okay.

01:09:02.142 --> 01:09:03.642
No, everything's fine.
Everything's under control.

01:09:03.727 --> 01:09:05.269
Very well, sir.

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:08.354
Excuse me.

01:09:16.072 --> 01:09:17.740
I'm taking it off.

01:09:21.202 --> 01:09:22.493
Wait a minute.

01:09:22.578 --> 01:09:23.953
Why? What, did you
just want to hurt me?

01:09:24.038 --> 01:09:25.581
Nonsense. I think you're wonderful.

01:09:25.665 --> 01:09:27.291
That was our house.
How could you do that?

01:09:27.375 --> 01:09:30.377
-I got there first.
-I want you to sell it back to me.

01:09:30.462 --> 01:09:33.255
-You can't afford it.
-Well, how's a million dollars?

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:35.174
The price is two.

01:09:35.258 --> 01:09:37.301
Oh, and if I had two,
the price would be four, right?

01:09:37.385 --> 01:09:39.595
Listen, I saw an opportunity and I took it.

01:09:39.679 --> 01:09:41.055
You had the money,
you had the right instincts,

01:09:41.139 --> 01:09:43.557
but you were too late. That's all.

01:09:43.933 --> 01:09:46.352
-I want you to work for me.
-You go to hell.

01:09:46.435 --> 01:09:49.020
-Listen, I mean it.
-Never.

01:09:49.104 --> 01:09:50.314
Why not?

01:09:50.982 --> 01:09:53.524
-Because I hate you.
-No, you don't.

01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:56.737
You wish you hated me.

01:10:17.676 --> 01:10:18.842
Hi, D.

01:10:23.348 --> 01:10:24.890
You look awful.

01:10:26.893 --> 01:10:29.645
-Where you been?
-I'll tell you about it.

01:10:30.021 --> 01:10:32.606
I'm just gonna have some wine first.

01:10:35.443 --> 01:10:37.111
Do you want some?

01:11:00.593 --> 01:11:02.344
So, where you been?

01:11:07.726 --> 01:11:12.187
Last night I stayed up for hours
trying to figure a way out of this mess.

01:11:14.858 --> 01:11:16.191
And today?

01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:21.864
And today I saw Gage.

01:11:29.789 --> 01:11:33.625
Thank you for your trust, David.
And for listening.

01:11:34.377 --> 01:11:36.420
-Did you fuck him?
-No.

01:11:36.504 --> 01:11:37.796
But you wanted to, right?

01:11:37.881 --> 01:11:40.549
David, I met him in broad daylight,
surrounded by a bunch of rich assholes.

01:11:40.633 --> 01:11:42.092
I don't believe you.

01:11:42.177 --> 01:11:44.720
David, he bought our property, okay?

01:11:45.388 --> 01:11:46.930
That's why I went to see him.

01:11:47.015 --> 01:11:50.017
I just wanted to find some way
to get it back.

01:11:50.935 --> 01:11:54.355
You have no reason to be jealous.
I hate him.

01:11:55.065 --> 01:11:56.648
D, you gotta tell me
what happened on that boat.

01:11:56.733 --> 01:11:59.485
-David, don't do this. Don't do this!
-Tell me what happened on that boat.

01:11:59.569 --> 01:12:01.779
-Why?
-Because I want to know.

01:12:02.322 --> 01:12:05.699
All right, I'll tell you. You know what?
The man was a fucking stallion, David.

01:12:05.784 --> 01:12:07.701
Is that what you want me to say?
We did it all night long.

01:12:07.786 --> 01:12:09.828
-Does that do it for you?
-Is that the truth?

01:12:09.913 --> 01:12:11.747
The truth?
You don't want the fucking truth.

01:12:11.831 --> 01:12:13.707
You want me to lie.
You want me to say he's awful.

01:12:13.792 --> 01:12:15.209
So, you know what?
I'm gonna tell you he's awful

01:12:15.293 --> 01:12:16.627
and you won't believe me.
How can I win?

01:12:16.711 --> 01:12:18.754
Just tell me the truth, D.

01:12:19.381 --> 01:12:21.632
It was sex, David. Just sex.

01:12:21.716 --> 01:12:23.425
Not love. Just sex.

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:26.178
-And was it good sex?
-Don't do this, David.

01:12:26.262 --> 01:12:28.263
Can you just tell me that, D?
Was it good?

01:12:28.348 --> 01:12:29.848
What are you hesitating for?
Just tell me.

01:12:29.933 --> 01:12:32.768
Was it good? Was it good?
Was it good?

01:12:33.687 --> 01:12:34.770
Yes.

01:12:45.949 --> 01:12:47.116
David.

01:12:50.412 --> 01:12:54.331
D, don't you tell me it was just sex

01:12:54.416 --> 01:12:56.208
because you were attracted to him
all along.

01:12:56.292 --> 01:12:58.293
You know that's bullshit.

01:12:58.461 --> 01:12:59.795
David, I did it for you.

01:12:59.879 --> 01:13:01.588
Don't you tell me you did it for me.

01:13:01.673 --> 01:13:03.632
-You did it for yourself.
-That's not... That's a lie.

01:13:03.717 --> 01:13:05.426
-You were dying to do it.
-That's a lie.

01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:08.345
I would never do this for myself.
It was all for you.

01:13:08.471 --> 01:13:11.724
Don't lie to me!
You were attracted to him!

01:14:13.161 --> 01:14:15.662
I knew something like this
was gonna happen.

01:14:15.747 --> 01:14:21.001
I guess you make a deal with the devil,
and eventually you pay the price, right?

01:14:21.544 --> 01:14:23.045
Thanks, Jeremy.

01:14:23.254 --> 01:14:25.214
Coming from the man
who closed the deal with the devil,

01:14:25.298 --> 01:14:26.674
that's very comforting.

01:14:30.428 --> 01:14:33.389
Green. Oh, hi, Di.

01:14:34.349 --> 01:14:35.808
I'm not here.

01:14:36.226 --> 01:14:39.353
Yeah, he's right here.
You want to speak to him?

01:14:39.521 --> 01:14:42.690
-No, I don't want to talk to him.
-Look, sweetie,

01:14:43.566 --> 01:14:48.570
he loves you, you love him.
I mean, you got to try and work this out.

01:14:48.655 --> 01:14:50.239
It's all pretty simple, right?

01:14:50.323 --> 01:14:52.199
This is a deal even I can't screw up.

01:14:52.283 --> 01:14:57.579
Tell him he can keep the money.
I don't want any of it.

01:15:07.048 --> 01:15:10.384
Davey, she said
she doesn't want the money.

01:15:11.594 --> 01:15:14.221
Well, I don't want the money, either.

01:15:23.356 --> 01:15:26.775
I'll take it. I mean, nobody else wants it.

01:15:50.050 --> 01:15:51.633
-Hey.
-Hi, Diana.

01:16:06.691 --> 01:16:09.902
The next few weeks without David
felt like months.

01:16:10.987 --> 01:16:13.530
I got very good at staring at walls.

01:16:13.990 --> 01:16:19.495
Diana. Diana. The recession has ended.

01:16:19.788 --> 01:16:23.749
There's a fellow out there,
he wants to see $1 0 million homes.

01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:25.501
There is a God.

01:16:30.048 --> 01:16:31.715
Find someone else.

01:16:32.509 --> 01:16:35.636
Find someone else? Are you nuts?

01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.680
Do you know what the commission is
on $1 0 million?

01:16:37.764 --> 01:16:40.057
-I can't do it.
-You have to do it.

01:16:40.141 --> 01:16:42.226
You're the best one I have.

01:16:42.352 --> 01:16:46.021
You're the only one I have.
The others are all on caravan.

01:16:52.153 --> 01:16:53.445
I'm sorry, Mr. Langford, I can't.

01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:59.034
Diana, I would never dream of forcing
you to do anything against your will.

01:17:00.870 --> 01:17:02.663
Except this one time.

01:17:04.791 --> 01:17:07.334
Now, move your ass or you're fired.

01:17:13.383 --> 01:17:16.969
If you think this is going to work,
you underestimate me.

01:17:42.370 --> 01:17:44.371
You are truly beautiful.

01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:48.751
What do you think you're doing?

01:17:50.754 --> 01:17:52.504
Looking for a house.

01:17:57.135 --> 01:18:00.346
Well, there's Bel Air, Holmby Hills,
Benedict Canyon, Pacific Palisades.

01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:03.182
-Where would you like to go first?
-Paris.

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:07.603
1120 Bel-Air Road, please.

01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.281
The ceilings are French Gothic.

01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:21.700
Renaissance paintings as you can see.

01:18:21.785 --> 01:18:23.869
Parquet floors throughout.

01:18:23.953 --> 01:18:26.205
The bathrooms are Italian marble.

01:18:26.289 --> 01:18:28.248
This is the master bath.

01:18:33.004 --> 01:18:35.631
Why didn't you return any of my calls?

01:18:36.299 --> 01:18:39.968
-Do you like it?
-No.

01:18:53.024 --> 01:18:54.733
-$30 million minimum.
-You think?

01:18:54.818 --> 01:18:57.069
-I know.
-Well, let's look at it.

01:18:57.237 --> 01:19:00.114
-It's not for sale.
-Everything's for sale.

01:19:31.438 --> 01:19:33.188
This is your house, isn't it?

01:19:36.026 --> 01:19:37.609
Do you like it?

01:19:43.033 --> 01:19:45.367
Well, it's certainly beautiful.

01:19:47.370 --> 01:19:51.165
What do you think it needs?
Tell me. Honestly.

01:19:54.627 --> 01:19:56.587
I think it needs a life.

01:19:58.131 --> 01:20:03.302
I think it needs furniture, and maybe
a couple of dogs and flowers.

01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:04.970
It needs you.

01:20:08.808 --> 01:20:12.019
Just forget it. It just won't work.

01:20:12.312 --> 01:20:13.562
Why not?

01:20:15.565 --> 01:20:18.859
Because from where we started,
we've got nowhere to go.

01:20:18.943 --> 01:20:20.736
You don't know that.

01:20:22.405 --> 01:20:24.782
I never started this way either.

01:20:27.827 --> 01:20:29.244
I need you.

01:20:33.625 --> 01:20:34.708
No.

01:20:35.627 --> 01:20:37.378
You collect things.

01:20:40.715 --> 01:20:42.091
Don't you?

01:20:44.094 --> 01:20:45.427
Sometimes.

01:20:51.768 --> 01:20:52.893
Yeah.

01:21:58.543 --> 01:22:02.671
Even if you were extremely rich,
and extremely smart,

01:22:02.756 --> 01:22:05.132
-can you be President?
-No.

01:22:05.216 --> 01:22:07.217
-You couldn't be President?
-No.

01:22:07.302 --> 01:22:08.510
Why not?

01:22:09.179 --> 01:22:13.098
I took a second job teaching citizenship
just to keep myself busy.

01:22:15.143 --> 01:22:20.230
-Ju, where were you born?
-I was born in Seoul, Korea.

01:22:20.523 --> 01:22:22.066
Okay, where was she born?

01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:25.944
-She was born in Seoul, Korea.
-She was born in Seoul, Korea.

01:22:26.696 --> 01:22:28.822
Now, Ju, do you have
any children born here?

01:22:34.329 --> 01:22:36.538
Where were you born, Miguel?

01:22:38.583 --> 01:22:39.792
Sorry.

01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.878
Welcome back. Where were you born?

01:22:43.463 --> 01:22:45.214
-Cuba.
-Cuba.

01:22:45.423 --> 01:22:48.258
So, how do we say Cuba in America?

01:22:49.052 --> 01:22:52.346
Cue-ba. Hi.

01:22:54.265 --> 01:22:57.434
-What are you doing here?
-Isn't this a citizenship class?

01:22:57.519 --> 01:22:59.269
-Yes.
-Can I sit in?

01:23:00.939 --> 01:23:02.272
It's full.

01:23:04.275 --> 01:23:05.401
Okay.

01:23:11.408 --> 01:23:12.533
Cuba.

01:23:12.617 --> 01:23:14.243
Cuba. Thank you.

01:23:29.884 --> 01:23:33.012
Okay. I have a question for you.

01:23:34.139 --> 01:23:37.766
Excuse me. Is there something
you'd like to share with us?

01:23:38.268 --> 01:23:41.311
I was just saying
that you're an amazing woman.

01:23:45.316 --> 01:23:48.861
And... And beautiful.

01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:51.530
And talented.

01:23:53.033 --> 01:23:55.659
And I am crazy about her.

01:24:05.253 --> 01:24:07.588
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

01:24:07.672 --> 01:24:09.506
I'm trying like hell.

01:24:09.966 --> 01:24:12.843
-I think maybe you should go.
-You want me to go?

01:24:12.927 --> 01:24:14.136
-No.
-No.

01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:19.850
Nice people.

01:24:20.518 --> 01:24:24.605
-They want the dream.
-Well, they saw it in the flesh tonight.

01:24:28.902 --> 01:24:31.028
You have chalk on your face.

01:24:34.574 --> 01:24:37.159
I have something I want to show you.

01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.134
I didn't know whether you liked big ones
or little ones.

01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:59.682
You're so beautiful. Come here.

01:25:02.936 --> 01:25:05.854
I didn't have much time
to do anything else.

01:25:08.525 --> 01:25:11.026
But it's a start.

01:25:24.666 --> 01:25:25.874
Dance?

01:25:29.004 --> 01:25:30.379
I should go.

01:25:35.969 --> 01:25:37.803
I remember once when I was young

01:25:37.887 --> 01:25:40.848
and I was coming back from someplace,
a movie or something,

01:25:40.932 --> 01:25:42.725
I was on the subway.

01:25:45.061 --> 01:25:49.356
There was a girl sitting across from me,
and she was wearing this dress

01:25:49.441 --> 01:25:53.777
that was buttoned clear up right to here.

01:25:57.907 --> 01:26:01.076
She was the most beautiful thing
I had ever seen.

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:05.998
And I was shy then.

01:26:06.166 --> 01:26:10.336
So when she would look at me,
I would look away.

01:26:13.089 --> 01:26:16.091
Then, afterwards,
when I would look back,

01:26:16.176 --> 01:26:17.926
she would look away.

01:26:19.804 --> 01:26:24.933
Then I got to where I was gonna get off
and I got off, the doors closed,

01:26:27.896 --> 01:26:30.356
and as the train was pulling away,

01:26:31.149 --> 01:26:35.444
she looked right at me
and gave me the most incredible smile.

01:26:39.407 --> 01:26:40.908
It was awful.

01:26:41.951 --> 01:26:43.535
I wanted to tear the doors open.

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:48.207
I went back every night, same time,
for two weeks.

01:26:51.711 --> 01:26:53.671
But she never showed up.

01:26:56.257 --> 01:26:58.258
That was 30 years ago

01:26:59.803 --> 01:27:04.556
and I don't think that there's a day
that goes by that I don't think about her.

01:27:06.351 --> 01:27:08.811
I don't want that to happen again.

01:27:15.902 --> 01:27:17.444
Just one dance?

01:30:52.202 --> 01:30:54.411
I want a word with you, Gage.

01:30:54.996 --> 01:30:58.457
See, what you don't know is,
we got a secret, me and Diana.

01:30:58.541 --> 01:31:00.209
We're invincible.

01:31:01.670 --> 01:31:03.087
Diana, I need to talk to you.

01:31:03.171 --> 01:31:05.297
Maybe tomorrow
would be a better time to talk.

01:31:05.382 --> 01:31:07.675
Well, maybe tomorrow
would be a better time, you think...

01:31:07.759 --> 01:31:09.843
Hey, Johnny-baby,
I got a suggestion for you.

01:31:09.928 --> 01:31:11.178
You know that emblem you got,

01:31:11.262 --> 01:31:14.890
the Gryphon, the eagle,

01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:16.225
yeah, I don't think it's a good idea.

01:31:16.309 --> 01:31:17.643
I got a better idea.

01:31:17.727 --> 01:31:19.311
Shall I...

01:31:19.396 --> 01:31:21.021
How about the cuckoo?

01:31:21.106 --> 01:31:24.400
You know, because, it's...
I'm talking to you for a second...

01:31:24.734 --> 01:31:27.820
The cuckoo is an interesting bird
because it doesn't have its own nest,

01:31:27.904 --> 01:31:31.782
so it moves into the nest
of other birds and it destroys their eggs.

01:31:31.866 --> 01:31:33.617
David, stop. Just...

01:31:36.579 --> 01:31:38.622
You don't love me anymore?

01:31:44.087 --> 01:31:47.172
Have I ever...
Have I ever told you I love you?

01:31:51.386 --> 01:31:53.137
Have a nice dinner.

01:31:55.432 --> 01:31:56.682
Help him.

01:31:59.144 --> 01:32:00.477
Go inside.

01:34:34.466 --> 01:34:36.717
You've done a lot since USC.

01:34:38.053 --> 01:34:43.223
First in your class, the AIA award,
Prix de Rome.

01:34:44.642 --> 01:34:45.768
Yeah.

01:34:47.145 --> 01:34:49.313
Why would you want this job?

01:34:50.106 --> 01:34:51.899
Well, I want to work.

01:34:56.863 --> 01:34:58.447
Over-qualified.

01:34:59.157 --> 01:35:00.783
Fine. Exploit me.

01:35:37.821 --> 01:35:40.406
Great architecture is only gonna
come from your passion.

01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:42.991
And even that won't assure you a job.

01:35:43.076 --> 01:35:47.746
Louis Kahn, died in a men's room
in Penn Station.

01:35:47.831 --> 01:35:49.873
For days, no one claimed the body.

01:35:49.958 --> 01:35:51.792
Look at that. Is that beautiful?

01:35:51.876 --> 01:35:54.003
The money men did not weep.

01:35:54.504 --> 01:35:57.214
Because the great ones
are impossible to deal with.

01:35:57.298 --> 01:35:58.632
They're a pain in the ass,

01:35:58.717 --> 01:36:02.094
because they know
that if they do theirjobs properly,

01:36:02.178 --> 01:36:04.763
if they just this once get it right,

01:36:04.848 --> 01:36:09.184
they can actually lift the human spirit,
take it to a higher place.

01:36:14.816 --> 01:36:17.026
-What is this?
-A brick.

01:36:18.903 --> 01:36:22.114
-Good. What else?
-Aweapon.

01:36:26.536 --> 01:36:30.205
Louis Kahn said even a brick
wants to be something.

01:36:37.797 --> 01:36:41.133
A brick wants to be something.

01:36:44.012 --> 01:36:45.387
It aspires.

01:36:52.187 --> 01:36:57.191
Even a common, ordinary brick
wants to be something more than it is.

01:37:02.906 --> 01:37:05.783
It wants to be something better
than it is.

01:37:14.417 --> 01:37:16.710
And that is what we must be.

01:37:20.548 --> 01:37:22.257
See you on Friday.

01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:37.523
A brick wants to be something, huh?
I bet it doesn't want to be a lawyer.

01:37:37.691 --> 01:37:40.275
-What are you doing here?
-I missed you.

01:37:40.777 --> 01:37:43.070
-I missed you, too.
-Thanks.

01:37:48.785 --> 01:37:52.287
-How you doing?
-I'm good. Getting it together.

01:37:58.962 --> 01:38:00.713
She wants a divorce.

01:38:03.883 --> 01:38:04.883
She wants her freedom,

01:38:04.968 --> 01:38:10.931
and if you don't contest it,
you get everything.

01:38:11.599 --> 01:38:14.601
The land, the money, everything.

01:38:16.062 --> 01:38:17.521
Where is she?

01:38:20.900 --> 01:38:22.443
Hi, everybody.

01:38:26.322 --> 01:38:29.783
Hi, everybody. I'm Billy Connolly.
Goodbye, everybody.

01:38:30.035 --> 01:38:31.952
You may wonder
what you're doing here,

01:38:32.037 --> 01:38:36.081
sitting in the blazing sun
as the smell of the zoo

01:38:36.166 --> 01:38:37.750
wafts past your nostrils.

01:38:37.834 --> 01:38:41.003
The reason you're here
is because you are loaded.

01:38:41.504 --> 01:38:44.256
May I say how brilliant it is
to see so many people

01:38:44.341 --> 01:38:47.593
with an interest in the preservation
of endangered species.

01:38:47.677 --> 01:38:51.263
Every year we have this unique way
of making money for the cause.

01:38:51.348 --> 01:38:52.514
We auction animals.

01:38:52.599 --> 01:38:54.767
We bid as high as we possibly can,

01:38:54.851 --> 01:38:57.269
and the money goes
to sponsor these lovely beasts.

01:38:57.354 --> 01:38:59.229
Let's start the show with a bang.

01:38:59.314 --> 01:39:02.107
We've got a superstar
as our first animal.

01:39:02.192 --> 01:39:05.361
Ladies and gentlemen, the hippo.

01:39:05.528 --> 01:39:09.198
The animal itself is far too big
and angry to bring along.

01:39:09.491 --> 01:39:10.824
Look at this guy.

01:39:10.909 --> 01:39:16.163
Thousands and thousands of pounds
of aggressive, hostile cellulite.

01:39:16.247 --> 01:39:19.291
Weighs slightly less
than the average school bus.

01:39:19.376 --> 01:39:22.169
And look at that magnificent beastie.

01:39:22.462 --> 01:39:26.590
To put him in a better light,
to relieve you of some serious money...

01:39:27.342 --> 01:39:29.134
Thank you very much.

01:39:29.678 --> 01:39:32.054
...we have a kissy-kissy picture.

01:39:33.139 --> 01:39:34.765
Isn't that nice?

01:39:38.061 --> 01:39:39.478
Ladies and gentlemen,
I couldn't even dream

01:39:39.562 --> 01:39:43.023
of starting the bid below $10,000.

01:39:43.108 --> 01:39:45.484
-Now, I know that's a lot of money...
-Thirty.

01:39:45.568 --> 01:39:49.905
$30,000, ladies and gentlemen.

01:39:50.615 --> 01:39:54.952
Call me a sentimental old fool,
do I hear 35?

01:39:55.578 --> 01:39:58.414
-Thirty five.
-$35,000.

01:39:58.498 --> 01:40:01.000
-Forty.
-$40,000. Ladies and gentlemen.

01:40:01.084 --> 01:40:03.502
-45,000.
-45,000.

01:40:03.586 --> 01:40:07.047
-Fifty.
-$50,000.

01:40:07.757 --> 01:40:10.009
I can't believe it. That's extraordinary.

01:40:10.093 --> 01:40:15.014
$50,000 once, $50,000 twice,
ladies and gentlemen...

01:40:15.473 --> 01:40:16.890
$1 million.

01:40:24.232 --> 01:40:27.317
-I'm sorry?
-$1 million.

01:40:30.655 --> 01:40:33.198
Did you say $1 million, sir?

01:40:34.075 --> 01:40:35.075
Yeah.

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.287
Ladies and gentlemen, $1 million.

01:40:39.914 --> 01:40:43.792
Would anybody care to top that,
ladies and gentlemen?

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.336
I didn't think so.

01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:48.714
In that case, sir, I believe
you're the proud owner of a hippo.

01:40:48.798 --> 01:40:50.466
Congratulations.

01:41:04.439 --> 01:41:05.898
Hello, Diana.

01:41:06.024 --> 01:41:09.068
Ladies and gentlemen, the next animal
to take the stand is an ostrich.

01:41:09.152 --> 01:41:11.737
I really wanted you to have that money.

01:41:11.821 --> 01:41:14.656
And I really wanted you
to have that hippo.

01:41:15.116 --> 01:41:17.409
But we love them in Scotland...

01:41:17.827 --> 01:41:20.579
Maybe you two
would like a moment alone.

01:41:25.752 --> 01:41:28.754
So, can we hear a bid
of, maybe, a million?

01:41:32.634 --> 01:41:34.843
-45,000.
-$45,000.

01:41:34.928 --> 01:41:36.053
So...

01:41:39.557 --> 01:41:40.766
-How are you?
-I hear you...

01:41:40.850 --> 01:41:42.101
-Sorry, go ahead.
-...are teaching. Go ahead.

01:41:42.185 --> 01:41:43.894
-I'm sorry.
-Go ahead.

01:41:44.396 --> 01:41:46.063
Yeah. I'm teaching.

01:41:49.192 --> 01:41:50.609
You know, it doesn't pay much,

01:41:50.694 --> 01:41:53.696
but at least I get to talk
about architecture.

01:41:54.155 --> 01:41:56.615
You know how I love to talk
about architecture.

01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.367
Oh, my goodness.

01:41:59.244 --> 01:42:01.662
Don't leave, ladies and gentlemen.
It's just a little shower.

01:42:01.746 --> 01:42:06.000
Please, ladies...
A check book makes an ideal umbrella.

01:42:06.209 --> 01:42:09.294
Do we have a dolphin?
We have dolphins.

01:42:09.379 --> 01:42:11.588
How about tropical fish?

01:42:11.673 --> 01:42:14.800
I know, you're running home
for more cash. I get it.

01:42:14.884 --> 01:42:18.137
Come on, ladies and gentlemen,
you can find the money.

01:42:18.221 --> 01:42:20.347
Oh, to hell. I'm gone.

01:42:30.275 --> 01:42:32.651
Listen, I have to talk to you
about what happened, D.

01:42:32.736 --> 01:42:35.404
-Don't. Don't.
-No, no, no. I have to.

01:42:35.530 --> 01:42:37.156
Just hear me out.

01:42:40.660 --> 01:42:43.162
I think the mistake I made in Vegas

01:42:43.913 --> 01:42:46.874
was thinking that I could forget
what we did.

01:42:49.502 --> 01:42:51.754
I thought we were invincible.

01:42:53.590 --> 01:42:57.134
But now I know that the things
that people in love do to each other,

01:42:57.218 --> 01:42:58.719
they remember.

01:42:59.596 --> 01:43:03.057
And if they stay together,
it's not because they forget,

01:43:03.141 --> 01:43:05.184
it's because they forgive.

01:43:12.025 --> 01:43:13.525
I was just...

01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:19.865
I was just so afraid that you wanted him.

01:43:21.493 --> 01:43:25.162
No, actually I was afraid
that you were right to want him.

01:43:29.918 --> 01:43:32.294
I thought he was the better man.

01:43:38.343 --> 01:43:40.135
I know now he's not.

01:43:41.971 --> 01:43:44.014
He's just got more money.

01:45:16.358 --> 01:45:18.275
I think we should talk.

01:45:19.069 --> 01:45:20.652
I am very happy.

01:45:22.530 --> 01:45:26.033
Shackleford,
have you ever seen me like this?

01:45:27.577 --> 01:45:29.578
I can't say that I have.

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:33.749
-Diana is the reason.
-Enough for any man.

01:45:34.292 --> 01:45:37.211
She is the best of them. Absolutely.

01:45:39.339 --> 01:45:43.592
-You are the best of them.
-The best of them?

01:45:45.011 --> 01:45:48.222
-You said I'm the best of them?
-You are.

01:45:52.227 --> 01:45:53.936
I don't understand.

01:45:55.689 --> 01:45:58.482
Shackleford, could you explain it to her?

01:45:59.025 --> 01:46:02.653
What? I could do that, sir.

01:46:04.572 --> 01:46:08.200
But somehow I feel Miss Murphy
would rather hear it directly from you.

01:46:08.284 --> 01:46:09.910
Okay. All right.

01:46:11.121 --> 01:46:14.790
She's the best
of the million dollar club. Obviously.

01:46:18.378 --> 01:46:20.879
-Million dollar club?
-Now you got it.

01:46:23.758 --> 01:46:25.592
You told me you had
never done that before.

01:46:25.677 --> 01:46:28.429
How many members
would you say there are?

01:46:28.972 --> 01:46:30.472
-Members?
-Yeah.

01:46:32.434 --> 01:46:34.560
-Worldwide?
-Yeah.

01:46:37.022 --> 01:46:38.981
I think a couple of dozen.

01:46:39.983 --> 01:46:42.985
Remember the one
that wouldn't stop hiccupping?

01:46:43.111 --> 01:46:44.069
What?

01:46:44.154 --> 01:46:45.738
The waitress from Oklahoma.

01:46:45.822 --> 01:46:49.074
Every time you came near her,
she would convulse with the hiccups.

01:46:51.494 --> 01:46:53.370
Yeah, I had forgotten.

01:46:54.122 --> 01:46:55.664
Quite a night.

01:46:57.334 --> 01:47:01.795
See, the best thing of it is that
you know if you're sexually compatible

01:47:03.131 --> 01:47:04.923
right from the start.

01:47:16.019 --> 01:47:18.520
Shackleford, would you stop the car?

01:47:48.176 --> 01:47:49.760
Thank you, John.

01:47:54.015 --> 01:47:57.142
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

01:48:05.151 --> 01:48:06.318
Here.

01:48:10.865 --> 01:48:12.157
For luck.

01:48:15.787 --> 01:48:16.912
Yeah.

01:48:20.917 --> 01:48:22.918
-Take care of him.
-Sure.

01:48:31.928 --> 01:48:33.887
What was all that about?

01:48:36.224 --> 01:48:37.933
I wanted to end it.

01:48:42.564 --> 01:48:46.108
She never would have looked at me
the way she did at him.

01:49:37.369 --> 01:49:41.497
Seven years ago, David proposed
to me on the pier at Paradise Cove.

01:49:42.665 --> 01:49:46.335
I wanted to go there to remember,
and start over.

01:50:53.570 --> 01:50:55.946
Have I ever told you I love you?

01:51:06.291 --> 01:51:07.333
No.

01:51:12.088 --> 01:51:13.213
I do.

01:51:19.512 --> 01:51:20.679
Still?

01:51:25.143 --> 01:51:26.352
Always.
