01:17.161 --> 01:18.996
<i>Mayday! Mayday!</i>

01:19.163 --> 01:23.000
This is the trawler <i>Annabelle.</i> I've lost
my bearings and I'm taking on water.

01:23.167 --> 01:27.671
My last good reading is
44 degrees north, 68 degrees...

01:31.842 --> 01:34.887
<i>Portland Station to</i>
Annabelle<i>. What is your current position?</i>

01:35.054 --> 01:36.180
I don't know exactly, Portland.

01:36.347 --> 01:39.225
Off the coast somewhere
near Rockwell! Wait.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.560
The lighthouse! I see it!

03:02.600 --> 03:03.684
<i>Over here, honey!</i>

03:06.937 --> 03:09.523
Hey, Mom!
You won't believe our good luck.

03:09.690 --> 03:10.941
Guess what I found?

03:11.108 --> 03:13.152
Hogarth, we've been through this before.

03:13.319 --> 03:14.612
No pets.

03:14.778 --> 03:16.322
Oh, but he's not a pet, Mom.

03:16.488 --> 03:17.615
He's a friend.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.491
Hogarth, we've got
to rent a room this year

03:19.658 --> 03:20.784
if we're gonna make ends meet,

03:20.951 --> 03:22.953
and no one wants to live in a place
with shredded upholstery.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.206
You'll never know he's there.
I'll keep him in a cage.

03:25.372 --> 03:29.001
Until you feel sorry for him
and set him free in the house!

03:29.168 --> 03:31.462
<i>Do you remember
the raccoon, Hogarth?</i>

03:31.629 --> 03:34.131
Ugh... I remember the raccoon.

03:34.298 --> 03:37.218
Please, Mom, at least look at him.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.679
Oh, all right, all right.
Where is this guy?

03:40.846 --> 03:43.140
<i>Annie,
I can't read this handwriting.</i>

03:43.307 --> 03:46.143
<i>Yeah, that one, that one should
have lettuce, tomato, extra mayo.</i>

03:46.310 --> 03:49.813
I will go get him, okay?

03:51.148 --> 03:53.692
So he wants us to hold
the mayo and the mustard.

03:53.859 --> 03:56.695
<i>How about just hold the flavor altogether?</i>

04:02.993 --> 04:04.245
Excuse me.

04:04.578 --> 04:07.498
Excuse me. Sir?

04:08.415 --> 04:09.917
Sir?

04:10.084 --> 04:11.210
Sir!

04:11.377 --> 04:13.170
Excuse me...

04:15.381 --> 04:18.342
- Huh? What's that?
- Please don't move, sir.

04:18.509 --> 04:21.178
My pet's under your table. Don't look!

04:21.762 --> 04:24.348
If you make a scene,
my mom won't let me keep him.

04:24.515 --> 04:26.433
- What kind of pet, kid?
- A squirrel.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.851
But don't worry. He's friendly.

04:28.018 --> 04:31.021
I'm telling the truth, dang it!
It came from outer space.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.439
I saw it.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.526
And it was headed toward land.

04:35.693 --> 04:38.195
I called the government
in Washington about it.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.865
May, maybe it was a <i>Sputnik</i>
or an invader from Mars.

04:42.032 --> 04:45.077
That's what it is.
It's an invader from Mars!

04:45.244 --> 04:48.789
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified flying object.

04:48.956 --> 04:52.710
Unidentified? Knowing you, Earl,
I'd say it was either whiskey or beer.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.551
Hey. I saw it, too.

05:02.886 --> 05:03.971
I rest my case.

05:07.391 --> 05:10.060
- Ah...
- I believe you.

05:10.561 --> 05:11.895
What if it is <i>Sputnik?</i>

05:12.563 --> 05:15.232
Or a flying saucer from Mars?

05:15.399 --> 05:16.942
I bet we could find it.

05:17.568 --> 05:20.279
Sorry, kid. I didn't really see anything.

05:20.446 --> 05:22.740
But if we don't stick up
for the kooks, who will?

05:22.906 --> 05:24.908
Is my son bothering you, sir?

05:26.827 --> 05:29.330
- Yes.
- No!

05:29.496 --> 05:31.081
Call me Dean.

05:32.082 --> 05:34.585
Uh, Hogarth, you were going
to get your pet, honey?

05:34.752 --> 05:35.794
I will, Mom.

05:35.961 --> 05:37.838
- Right after I finish talking with...
- Dean.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.257
Dean.

05:41.759 --> 05:43.761
- Found your pet.
- Where?

05:43.927 --> 05:44.970
It's up my leg, man.

05:45.137 --> 05:47.765
Squirrel's up my pants, Hogarth.
I'm trying not to wig out here.

05:47.931 --> 05:48.974
Don't wig out.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.643
Okay. He's heading north now.

05:52.436 --> 05:56.273
I'm sorry, kid. I'd like to apologize
to everyone in advance for this.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.611
Ooh!

06:02.988 --> 06:04.531
- Ah!
- Oh!

06:07.785 --> 06:09.286
Check, please.

06:09.787 --> 06:11.121
<i>It's a rat!</i>

06:16.960 --> 06:18.796
Hello, this is Hogarth Hughes speaking.
Who's calling, please?

06:18.962 --> 06:22.132
Hogarth, honey,
I'm really sorry, but...

06:22.299 --> 06:23.509
Thank you.

06:23.675 --> 06:27.137
I need to work late tonight.
There's some cold chicken in the icebox.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.972
You can have that and

06:29.139 --> 06:31.642
<i>- some carrots...</i>
- I'm way ahead of you, Mom.

06:31.809 --> 06:34.061
<i>- Good. I'll make it up to you, okay?</i>
- Okay.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.854
<i>- I love you, honey.</i>
- Me too.

06:36.021 --> 06:40.734
And, Hogarth, no scary movies,
no late snacks, in bed by 8:00. Got it?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.404
Come on, Mom. It's me, remember?

06:43.821 --> 06:47.324
<i>Why, the porpoise can communicate
telepathically, Miss Mullen.</i>

06:47.491 --> 06:51.662
<i>If we can transplant at least 15%
of their brain matter into ours,</i>

06:51.829 --> 06:54.331
<i>we may be able to read minds.</i>

06:56.417 --> 06:59.420
<i>Darn. A perfectly good brain wasted.</i>

06:59.586 --> 07:02.673
<i>I think you've seen enough.
How about a nightcap?</i>

07:02.840 --> 07:04.675
<i>Let's say, my place.</i>

07:04.842 --> 07:05.926
Oh, jeez.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.513
<i>- I was thinking the same thing.</i>
<i>- Mind reader.</i>

07:09.680 --> 07:12.599
<i>Darn. I seem to have left my keys
in the lab.</i>

07:17.563 --> 07:19.106
<i>Hmm.</i>

07:22.192 --> 07:24.236
You're gonna get it.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.371
<i>Who's there?</i>

07:39.418 --> 07:43.213
<i>No. No. No!</i>

07:49.720 --> 07:51.722
Oh, come on!

07:51.889 --> 07:53.390
Stupid antenna.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.261
Invaders from Mars!

11:27.396 --> 11:28.980
Oh, Hogarth.

11:34.444 --> 11:35.737
Oh!

11:38.323 --> 11:39.950
Hogarth?

11:40.117 --> 11:41.243
Honey?

11:52.462 --> 11:54.297
Hogarth?

11:55.632 --> 11:56.675
Hogarth!

13:37.901 --> 13:40.362
Help! Help! Stop! Help!

13:45.909 --> 13:47.077
<i>Hogarth?</i>

13:47.410 --> 13:49.204
- Hogarth!
- Mom!

13:49.371 --> 13:50.455
What do you think you're doing?

13:50.622 --> 13:53.083
Don't you know better
than to wander off at night alone?

13:53.250 --> 13:54.584
What if something happened to you?

13:54.918 --> 13:56.461
I'm sorry, Mom.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.464
Oh, don't you ever do that
to me again, Hogarth.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.801
I was so scared. I thought I'd lost you.

14:03.385 --> 14:06.555
Mom, you won't believe this.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.974
Something ate our TV antenna.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.812
- Oh, Hogarth...
- No, no! I'm serious!

14:14.271 --> 14:16.064
Oh, but it's not <i>Sputnik,</i>
like Mr. Stutz thought.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.399
Hogarth...

14:17.566 --> 14:20.068
- No, it's a robot! No, really, it is!
- Hogarth... Hogarth...

14:20.235 --> 14:22.946
- And the robot, it's 100 feet high!
- Please...

14:23.113 --> 14:24.906
- Hogarth!
- And it eats metal!

14:25.073 --> 14:27.284
Stop it! Just...

14:27.450 --> 14:28.743
Stop.

14:29.286 --> 14:30.954
I'm not...

14:32.497 --> 14:34.124
I'm not in the mood.

14:35.959 --> 14:38.295
Come on. Let's go home.

14:55.478 --> 14:58.648
<i>A peaceful stay-at-home
kind of day, in a town</i>

14:58.815 --> 15:00.191
<i>very much like your own.</i>

15:00.358 --> 15:02.652
<i>But then, suddenly
without warning...</i>

15:04.195 --> 15:06.823
<i>Atomic holocaust!</i>

15:06.990 --> 15:09.451
<i>But how does one survive
an atomic attack?</i>

15:09.618 --> 15:11.661
Hey. Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?

15:11.828 --> 15:14.039
He says his boat
ran into a sea monster.

15:14.205 --> 15:16.124
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.168
No, no, no. It was a metal meteor.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.211
- It ate his boat. My dad says...
- Ah...

15:20.378 --> 15:21.838
It wasn't any of those things.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.673
What would you know about it, Poindexter?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.133
- Hogarth!
- Shh...

15:25.300 --> 15:27.052
Don't make me come over there.

15:36.061 --> 15:40.023
It's about 50 or 60 feet high
and it only eats metal.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.483
Shut up, you little spaz!

15:41.650 --> 15:44.819
It's probably been sent by foreign enemies
to take over the country.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.739
We should bomb it to smithereens
before it does.

15:54.496 --> 15:58.333
Why's a nice girl like you
serving coffee to a guy like me?

15:58.500 --> 16:02.379
Particularly when I have the right
to refuse service to anyone.

16:02.837 --> 16:05.590
I'm sorry about yesterday. I, uh...

16:06.257 --> 16:08.009
I'm usually, hmm...

16:08.176 --> 16:09.386
Not like that?

16:09.552 --> 16:11.888
Right.

16:12.722 --> 16:13.890
Oh, it wasn't your fault.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.059
Hogarth just...

16:17.060 --> 16:18.687
I think he's lonely.

16:19.229 --> 16:20.563
Yeah.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.899
Well, he's a good kid.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.903
Hey, come on outside.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.238
I got something to show you.

16:30.407 --> 16:31.282
Thanks for the scrap, Floyd.

16:31.449 --> 16:34.202
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it, it's got this,

16:34.369 --> 16:37.789
um, this large bite out of it.

16:37.956 --> 16:41.584
That's why I'm selling it.
It's got a large bite out of it.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.420
What could've done this?

16:43.586 --> 16:46.047
- I told you what.
- Oh, yeah.

16:46.214 --> 16:49.718
Strange invaders.

16:49.884 --> 16:53.096
Thanks for believing me.
I really did call the government.

16:53.263 --> 16:57.058
Yeah. They're sending someone
to take care of the whole thing.

16:57.225 --> 16:59.644
Jeez, Earl. You really are crazy.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.980
I mean, who in the hell would
the government send?

17:05.567 --> 17:08.111
Kent Mansley, United States Government,
Unexplained Phenomena Department.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.988
- Marv Loach. I'm the foreman here.
- What happened here?

17:10.155 --> 17:14.242
Not sure. Sometimes the line'll snap
if the weather is bad, sure.

17:14.409 --> 17:15.452
But for a whole tower

17:15.618 --> 17:18.246
to get twisted up like that, whoa!

17:19.289 --> 17:20.582
It's got me beat.

17:20.957 --> 17:25.920
It's almost like it was bitten off
by some enormous beast.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.964
Enormous beast.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.467
Yeah, what do you think? Escaped gorilla?

17:30.633 --> 17:31.968
Uh, what department is that again?

17:32.135 --> 17:36.139
Frankly, I'm not at liberty to reveal the
particulars of the agency I work for

17:36.306 --> 17:37.807
and all that, that implies.

17:37.974 --> 17:40.351
You mean, uh, national security?

17:40.518 --> 17:41.853
Let's put it this way.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.271
Every once in a while, things happen

17:43.438 --> 17:47.025
that just can't be rationalized
in a conventional way.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.819
People wanna know that
their government has a response.

17:49.986 --> 17:52.489
I am that response.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.783
So, were there any witnesses?

17:54.949 --> 17:57.327
Well, sir, if you'll just follow me.

17:57.786 --> 18:00.663
We did find this.

18:02.624 --> 18:04.834
<i>United States Government, huh?</i>

18:05.043 --> 18:07.670
Guess that means something big's
happening here, eh?

18:07.837 --> 18:11.716
No, Marv. Big things happen in big places.

18:11.883 --> 18:15.887
And the sooner I fill out my report,
the sooner I can get back to them.

18:16.513 --> 18:18.515
Enormous beast, yeah...

18:21.017 --> 18:23.394
Biggest thing in this town is probably
the homecoming queen.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.522
Oh, my God!

18:30.527 --> 18:31.653
- Come on, Marv. Come on.
- Okay.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.154
I need a witness.
It's around the corner. Come on.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.489
- Pick up the pace here.
- Don't pull so hard.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.533
I've never seen anything like it.
It's like a big, big "chomp"

18:36.699 --> 18:37.867
- out of the side of the car.
- Take it easy...

18:38.034 --> 18:40.245
It's like a bite out of a ham
sandwich, like a, uh...

18:44.541 --> 18:47.919
What uh, what are we looking
at here, Mr. Manley?

18:48.711 --> 18:50.505
Something big, Marv.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.717
Something big.

19:01.683 --> 19:03.560
Hello!

19:03.726 --> 19:06.396
Come out!

19:06.896 --> 19:08.523
Hey, big metal guy!

19:08.690 --> 19:11.609
I got food here for you!

19:12.235 --> 19:13.528
Metal!

19:13.695 --> 19:16.030
Crunchy, delicious metal!

19:16.197 --> 19:18.616
Come and get it!

20:56.005 --> 20:59.384
So, I guess you're not gonna hurt me, huh?

21:06.808 --> 21:08.518
<i>The shutoff switch.</i>

21:10.687 --> 21:12.647
You saw me save you.

21:15.024 --> 21:18.486
So, where are you from?

21:20.989 --> 21:23.533
You came from the sky, right?

21:24.033 --> 21:25.535
From up there?

21:26.035 --> 21:27.704
Don't you remember anything?

21:29.539 --> 21:34.419
Hmm. Maybe it's that
bump on your head.

21:36.713 --> 21:38.756
Do you talk?

21:40.049 --> 21:43.011
You know, words?
"Blah, blah, blah," like that?

21:43.177 --> 21:44.721
Can you do that? "Blah, blah, blah?"

21:48.725 --> 21:51.769
Well, you get the idea anyway.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.397
Let's see.

21:54.564 --> 21:58.026
See this? This is called a rock.

21:58.192 --> 21:59.360
Rock.

21:59.610 --> 22:01.237
Rock.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.572
Good.

22:06.284 --> 22:07.410
Rock.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.370
Yes!

22:11.914 --> 22:13.750
- Rock.
- No, no.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.252
That is a tree.

22:16.919 --> 22:18.963
Rock. Tree.

22:19.130 --> 22:20.381
Get it?

22:21.299 --> 22:24.135
Rock. Tree.

22:24.302 --> 22:25.762
That's right!

22:26.137 --> 22:28.431
Wow! My own giant robot.

22:28.598 --> 22:32.060
I am now the luckiest kid in America!

22:32.226 --> 22:33.311
This is unbelievable.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.271
This is the greatest discovery since...

22:35.438 --> 22:38.066
I don't know, television or something!

22:38.232 --> 22:40.443
I gotta tell someone.
I should call some...

22:40.610 --> 22:42.111
No, they'll panic.

22:42.278 --> 22:45.114
People always wig out and start shooting
when they see something big like you.

22:45.281 --> 22:48.951
- Hmm?
- Oh, wig out. It means crazy.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.286
You know, like, uh...

22:53.790 --> 22:55.625
No, no, no! Don't do that!

22:55.917 --> 22:58.294
That's the kind of stuff
that makes them shoot at you.

22:58.461 --> 23:01.839
Two nights ago,
at approximately 1900 hours, sat com radar

23:02.006 --> 23:05.968
detected an unidentified object
entering Earth's atmosphere.

23:06.135 --> 23:09.305
Losing contact with it two-and-a-half
miles off the coast of Rockwell.

23:09.472 --> 23:12.350
Some assumed it was a large meteor
or a downed satellite.

23:12.517 --> 23:15.269
But my office in Washington received
a call from someone

23:15.436 --> 23:18.606
who reported an actual encounter
with the object.

23:18.773 --> 23:21.818
This is no meteor, gentlemen.

23:21.984 --> 23:25.446
This is something much more serious. So...

23:25.613 --> 23:27.156
So, we can't call
<i>Ripley's Believe It or Not</i>

23:27.323 --> 23:29.700
<i>because they wouldn't believe it.</i>

23:29.867 --> 23:31.494
And...

23:31.661 --> 23:34.539
Oh, it's getting dark.
And if I don't get home soon

23:34.705 --> 23:36.499
Mom's gonna wonder where I am.

23:36.666 --> 23:41.045
If she comes looking for me and sees you
then we got the screaming problem again.

23:41.212 --> 23:44.841
So, for now, would you, you know, just...

23:45.007 --> 23:47.176
Just stay here, okay?

23:47.510 --> 23:48.845
I'll come back tomorrow.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.685
Wow.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.521
Well, goodbye.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.359
No, no.

24:03.860 --> 24:05.069
Me go.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.696
You stay.

24:06.863 --> 24:08.698
No following.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.325
Good.

24:12.994 --> 24:14.537
I told you!

24:14.704 --> 24:18.332
I'll come back tomorrow!

24:18.499 --> 24:20.877
Now, stay!

24:24.755 --> 24:26.716
<i>No, no, no!</i>

24:26.883 --> 24:28.718
<i>Bad robot!</i>

24:43.232 --> 24:46.903
Look, you can't go stomping around
and you can't come with me.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.071
My mom will wig out.

24:49.238 --> 24:51.532
<i>That's right.</i>

24:51.699 --> 24:57.079
So you have got to stay in the forest,
and I'll bring you some food tomorrow.

24:57.246 --> 25:01.042
But I gotta go home now.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.753
So, goodbye.

25:09.884 --> 25:11.093
Hmm...

25:11.260 --> 25:12.428
Hey.

25:14.430 --> 25:15.765
Hey, wait a minute!

25:15.932 --> 25:17.600
What do you think you're doing?

25:17.767 --> 25:19.560
Look at this mess!

25:25.441 --> 25:26.651
Oh, no.

25:27.944 --> 25:29.111
Put it back!

25:29.278 --> 25:30.821
Put it back right now!

25:32.114 --> 25:35.284
Help me! I need your help!

25:37.620 --> 25:38.996
Good, good!

25:44.794 --> 25:46.629
Okay, put them together. See, like this.

25:46.796 --> 25:48.297
This one here, that one there.

25:49.674 --> 25:51.801
Okay, over, over. Good, good.

25:51.968 --> 25:53.761
Now the other one.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.972
Okay. Good enough. Let's go!

25:58.808 --> 26:00.851
What the...

26:01.644 --> 26:04.855
That's fine! Leave it alone!
The train is coming!

26:05.022 --> 26:06.816
The train is coming!

26:07.775 --> 26:09.151
Come on, let's go!

26:26.168 --> 26:29.672
Oh, no, no, no, no.

26:32.675 --> 26:34.176
You're alive!

26:45.021 --> 26:48.024
<i>Hello? Anybody out there?</i>

26:48.190 --> 26:49.817
Oh, we're in trouble now.

26:49.984 --> 26:51.027
<i>Are you all right?</i>

26:51.193 --> 26:52.862
Look, I've changed my mind.
You can follow me home.

26:53.029 --> 26:54.322
Okay. Let's go.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.199
Mayor's office.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.577
What? A train accident?

26:59.744 --> 27:01.537
<i>What do you mean,
he hit a giant creature?</i>

27:01.871 --> 27:03.539
What creature could be big enough to...

27:05.207 --> 27:06.250
I need your car.

27:47.041 --> 27:48.250
Hmm...

27:48.584 --> 27:50.920
Wow! You can fix yourself?

27:51.420 --> 27:53.047
Neato.

27:53.214 --> 27:54.757
Uh-oh, Mom's home. Just stay here, okay?

27:54.924 --> 27:56.425
I'll be back. Bye!

27:57.927 --> 28:00.596
Bye. Hmm?

28:08.604 --> 28:10.314
What happened here?

28:11.107 --> 28:13.943
Go on. Tell him what you saw, Frank.

28:15.778 --> 28:22.660
You're not gonna believe this,
but it was a giant metal man.

28:27.164 --> 28:30.626
Does anyone know where I can get
to a telephone nearby?

28:34.004 --> 28:35.589
Would you say grace, please?

28:41.637 --> 28:42.972
Oh, my God!

28:44.306 --> 28:47.476
Um... Oh, my God,

28:47.852 --> 28:49.979
we, uh, thank you.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.648
For the

28:52.815 --> 28:55.025
food that Mom

28:55.192 --> 28:57.319
has put in front of us and... Stop!

28:58.821 --> 29:00.698
The, the devil

29:00.990 --> 29:04.785
from doing bad things and, uh...

29:04.952 --> 29:07.163
Get out of here! Ah...

29:08.164 --> 29:09.331
Satan?

29:10.207 --> 29:13.169
Go! Go, so...

29:13.711 --> 29:16.172
That we may live in peace. Amen.

29:16.630 --> 29:17.673
Amen.

29:18.340 --> 29:22.052
That was, hmm, really unusual, Hogarth.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.473
- Forgot to wash my hands.
- Well, uh, okay.

29:29.310 --> 29:30.895
<i>Tomorrowland...</i>

29:31.187 --> 29:33.481
<i>Promise of things to come.</i>

29:38.360 --> 29:40.154
Stop, stop, stop!

29:40.696 --> 29:42.990
All right. Come on.
Come on. Over here.

29:45.576 --> 29:48.037
Oh.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.089
Oh...

30:00.716 --> 30:02.384
Come on. Come on, over here. Come on.

30:04.887 --> 30:06.889
Hey there, scout. Kent Mansley.

30:07.056 --> 30:08.724
I work for the government.

30:09.058 --> 30:10.893
<i>Hogarth?</i>

30:13.729 --> 30:14.897
<i>Hogarth?</i>

30:15.189 --> 30:17.566
Hey there, scout. Kent Mansley.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.360
Work for the government.
Your parents home?

30:19.527 --> 30:21.403
- We're eating.
- Mmm, boy.

30:21.570 --> 30:23.364
Who's there, honey?

30:23.697 --> 30:24.907
Oh, hello there.

30:25.074 --> 30:26.742
- Do you have a telephone I could use?
- Yes.

30:26.909 --> 30:28.786
- There's one in the kitchen.
- Well, thank you.

30:28.953 --> 30:30.746
Thank you very much.

30:31.205 --> 30:33.541
Here. Pretend you're a gangster.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.211
Damn it, Mansley.
You call me at home for this?

30:37.378 --> 30:40.464
- You don't understand, sir.
- It ate my car.

30:40.631 --> 30:42.049
<i>And you saw this happen?</i>

30:42.216 --> 30:46.136
No, I didn't actually see it.
It went off into the woods.

30:46.303 --> 30:48.138
<i>So, you don't have any evidence?</i>

30:48.305 --> 30:50.099
But, but, sir, I've got an eyewitness!

30:50.266 --> 30:51.934
An eyewitness with a concussion.

30:52.476 --> 30:54.770
This thing... This thing is a menace.

30:54.937 --> 30:56.939
It tore up
the power station. It...

30:57.106 --> 30:58.440
It caused a train wreck!

30:58.607 --> 31:01.902
What did?
Tell me again, Mansley, and this time

31:02.069 --> 31:03.445
<i>listen to yourself.</i>

31:05.114 --> 31:06.907
A giant metal monster.

31:09.577 --> 31:12.288
Please, sir. I've got a feeling
about this one.

31:12.746 --> 31:15.916
<i>That's lovely, Kent.
But let me try to explain how this works.</i>

31:16.125 --> 31:19.920
If you told me you'd found, say,
a giant footprint,

31:20.087 --> 31:22.631
I might send over an expert
to make a plaster cast of it.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.300
Hell! You get me
a photograph of this thing

31:24.466 --> 31:26.468
and I could probably
get some troops over there!

31:26.635 --> 31:29.138
But you tell me you've got a "feeling"?

31:29.305 --> 31:31.348
All right then, fine. You want evidence?

31:31.515 --> 31:36.312
I'll get you evidence. And when I do,
I'm gonna wanna a memo distributed.

31:36.478 --> 31:37.521
That sounds swell, Kent.

31:37.688 --> 31:40.608
<i>I'm gonna want that memo
carbon copied and redistributed...</i>

31:55.497 --> 31:58.042
Hi. Thanks for the use of your phone.

31:58.876 --> 32:01.503
Well, thank you for the use
of your phone, Mrs...

32:01.670 --> 32:04.840
Hughes. Annie Hughes.
And this is my son, Hogarth.

32:05.007 --> 32:07.009
Thank you, Annie. Hobart.

32:07.343 --> 32:09.219
That's Hogarth!

32:10.220 --> 32:11.513
Hogarth.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.182
What an embarrassing name.

32:13.349 --> 32:15.351
Might as well call him Zeppo or something.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.187
What kind of a sick person
would name a kid Hogar...

32:20.230 --> 32:21.482
Hog Hug...

32:21.649 --> 32:23.359
Hog Hug. Hogarth Hughes!

32:27.863 --> 32:30.366
Kent Mansley.
You work for the government.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.701
I wasn't gonna say that.

32:33.035 --> 32:35.204
I have something for you, Hogarth.

32:35.371 --> 32:37.706
Your BB gun. Where did you find that?

32:37.873 --> 32:39.208
Up at the power station.

32:39.375 --> 32:42.044
- Hogarth was out there the other night.
- Really?

32:42.211 --> 32:44.505
See anything unusual, Hogarth?

32:44.880 --> 32:50.052
No...thing...unusual, really.

32:55.099 --> 32:56.266
Gotta use the bathroom.

33:04.441 --> 33:06.193
Strange, he's so tightlipped now.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.070
And the other night
he couldn't stop talking.

33:08.237 --> 33:10.406
I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot.

33:10.572 --> 33:12.241
A hundred-foot robot?

33:12.408 --> 33:14.243
That's nutty!

33:15.744 --> 33:17.579
- What else did he say?
<i>- No, wait, stop!</i>

33:19.415 --> 33:20.749
Excuse me.

33:25.129 --> 33:26.255
Hogarth?

33:26.422 --> 33:27.923
<i>What is going on in there?</i>

33:30.968 --> 33:32.594
Are you all right?

33:32.761 --> 33:34.221
<i>I'm fine.</i>

33:34.388 --> 33:36.765
You know, this sort of thing
is why it's so important

33:36.932 --> 33:39.435
to really chew your food.

33:43.939 --> 33:46.108
Hogarth?

33:46.608 --> 33:47.818
Hogarth?

33:47.985 --> 33:50.654
- Mom! A little privacy?
- Sorry.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.448
- Ow. Ha-ha. Ow.
- Sorry.

33:52.614 --> 33:54.616
Oh, Lord, he's been acting strange lately.

33:54.783 --> 33:55.826
That hurt.

34:06.795 --> 34:08.797
Thank you again, Annie.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.093
Good night, Hogarth.
I'm sure we'll see each other again

34:13.969 --> 34:15.804
real soon.

34:22.478 --> 34:27.149
If you're gonna stay here
you gotta keep better track of yourself.

34:27.316 --> 34:28.650
Sheesh.

34:28.859 --> 34:33.363
Anyway, I thought you'd like, you know,
a bedtime story or something.

34:33.614 --> 34:36.325
I've got some really cool ones.

34:36.992 --> 34:38.202
<i>MAD Magazine,</i>

34:38.368 --> 34:40.162
very funny.

34:40.871 --> 34:42.998
<i>The Spirit,</i> very cool.

34:43.665 --> 34:45.042
<i>Boy's Life...</i> Ehh...

34:45.209 --> 34:46.502
Oh, here.

34:46.835 --> 34:49.338
This guy is Superman.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.548
Sure, he's famous now,

34:51.715 --> 34:53.801
- but he started off just like you.
- Hmm...

34:54.009 --> 34:57.346
Crash-landed on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.

34:57.513 --> 35:02.351
But he only uses his powers for good,
never for evil.

35:03.018 --> 35:04.520
Remember that.

35:10.192 --> 35:12.861
Oh, that's Atomo, the metal menace.

35:13.153 --> 35:15.697
<i>He's not the hero. He's the villain.</i>

35:15.989 --> 35:17.658
He's not like you.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.493
You're a good guy.

35:19.993 --> 35:21.495
Like Superman.

35:21.870 --> 35:23.539
Superman.

35:27.835 --> 35:30.546
- Oh, you're hungry, aren't you?
- Mmm-hmm.

35:30.712 --> 35:33.048
But I don't have any metal here.

35:33.674 --> 35:35.217
Just follow me.

35:37.177 --> 35:38.720
Pick me up, okay?

35:47.729 --> 35:49.189
Wow.

35:50.732 --> 35:52.359
Okay, now, march!

35:57.406 --> 35:58.740
Whoo.

36:12.296 --> 36:13.422
Hmm?

36:13.589 --> 36:15.299
Oh, yeah. That's Rockwell.

36:15.632 --> 36:18.260
- Nice place, huh?
- Rockwell?

36:18.427 --> 36:20.929
Yes, I was born right down there.

36:21.096 --> 36:22.472
Rockwell!

36:24.725 --> 36:26.435
No, stop! Look out for the cow!

36:27.269 --> 36:29.104
Come on, no, not there!

36:29.271 --> 36:32.107
Please stop. No, stop!

36:34.484 --> 36:36.445
We can't go there yet.

36:36.653 --> 36:39.281
People just aren't ready for you.

36:51.793 --> 36:53.295
That was close.

36:53.462 --> 36:55.797
We can't go running
around like that, okay?

36:55.964 --> 36:58.342
- Hmm...
- Hey, look!

36:58.508 --> 36:59.927
Hmm?

37:01.345 --> 37:04.973
I guess that would be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.518
Oh, no. We gotta hide!

37:08.977 --> 37:10.312
You know, hide?

37:10.479 --> 37:12.439
It's when you... You know, when you...

37:12.606 --> 37:14.483
Just get behind something, quick!

37:18.862 --> 37:20.155
Don't move.

37:48.016 --> 37:50.686
Our troubles are over.

37:55.524 --> 37:56.650
<i>This is it.</i>

37:56.817 --> 37:58.402
All you can eat.

38:11.915 --> 38:14.501
Shh. Turn it off!

38:19.881 --> 38:21.717
Come on, just turn it off!

38:30.267 --> 38:31.893
Oh, no.

38:32.728 --> 38:33.729
All right, who's out there?

38:37.232 --> 38:40.736
Hey, hey, I know you. Squirrel boy.

38:40.902 --> 38:42.070
Hogarth.

38:42.237 --> 38:44.865
By night, known as Hogarth. Got it.

38:45.032 --> 38:47.075
Well, come on inside, kid.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.577
<i>Sorry about the crowbar.</i>

38:49.244 --> 38:52.289
<i>You'd be surprised how many
people wanna steal scrap.</i>

38:52.456 --> 38:56.251
<i>But, man, once I turn it into art,
I can't give it away.</i>

38:56.418 --> 38:57.627
<i>I mean, what am I?</i>

38:57.794 --> 39:01.423
<i>A junkman who sells art
or an artist who sells junk?</i>

39:01.590 --> 39:02.966
<i>You tell me.</i>

39:03.133 --> 39:05.260
<i>I like it... I think.</i>

39:06.094 --> 39:10.265
Listen, you're, you're not
gonna call my mom, are you?

39:10.432 --> 39:12.267
She doesn't know I'm out. I...

39:12.434 --> 39:16.063
Don't worry, kid. Look, it's not my style
to report a guy to the authorities.

39:17.481 --> 39:19.775
I'm gonna have some coffee.
What do you want, some, uh,

39:19.941 --> 39:22.486
milk, or what? Milk?

39:22.652 --> 39:23.945
Coffee's fine.

39:25.906 --> 39:28.283
Yeah. I drink it. I'm hip.

39:28.450 --> 39:29.618
I don't know.

39:29.785 --> 39:33.288
This is espresso, you know?
It's like coffee-zilla.

39:33.455 --> 39:35.499
I said, I'm hip.

39:38.627 --> 39:40.253
So she moved me up a grade
because I wasn't fitting in.

39:40.420 --> 39:41.755
So, now I'm even more not fitting in.

39:41.922 --> 39:43.256
I was getting good grades.
You know, like all A's.

39:43.423 --> 39:44.674
So, my mom says, "You need stimulation."

39:44.841 --> 39:46.468
And I go, "No, I'm
stimulated enough right now."

39:46.635 --> 39:47.677
- That's for sure.
- She goes,

39:47.928 --> 39:49.012
"Uh-uh, you don't have a challenge.

39:49.179 --> 39:50.972
"You need a challenge."
So, now I'm challenged, all right.

39:51.139 --> 39:53.100
I'm challenged to hold on
to my lunch money,

39:53.266 --> 39:54.851
because of all the big mooses
who wanna pound me

39:55.018 --> 39:56.978
because I'm a shrimpy dork
who thinks he's smarter than them.

39:57.145 --> 39:59.356
But I don't think I am smarter,
I just do the stupid homework.

39:59.523 --> 40:00.941
If everyone else just did
the stupid homework

40:01.108 --> 40:02.192
they could move up a grade
and get pounded too.

40:02.359 --> 40:03.693
Is there anymore coffee?

40:03.860 --> 40:05.987
Look, it's really
none of my business, kid,

40:06.154 --> 40:09.825
but, um, who cares
what these creeps think, you know?

40:09.991 --> 40:12.828
They don't decide who you are. You do.

40:12.994 --> 40:16.164
You are who you choose to be.

40:19.334 --> 40:20.460
Did you hear that?

40:20.627 --> 40:22.045
No, wait. Stop!

40:34.516 --> 40:36.017
- It's okay!
- My God!

40:36.184 --> 40:38.353
- He isn't gonna...
- Run, kid! Run!

40:42.190 --> 40:44.317
It's okay. He isn't...

40:44.484 --> 40:46.319
It's okay. He isn't gonna hurt me.

40:46.486 --> 40:47.571
Oh, hey...

40:47.737 --> 40:49.489
Don't squash him! No! Don't...

40:49.656 --> 40:51.199
<i>Do not...</i>

40:51.366 --> 40:53.535
Squash him.

40:54.536 --> 40:55.704
His name is Dean.

40:55.871 --> 40:57.831
We like Dean.

40:58.665 --> 41:00.000
Dean.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.211
So...

41:03.378 --> 41:05.547
Where'd, uh, where'd he come from?

41:06.047 --> 41:07.549
He doesn't remember.

41:07.716 --> 41:10.010
He's like a little kid.

41:10.177 --> 41:12.554
Little. Yeah.

41:12.721 --> 41:15.223
Wait a minute. You can talk to him?

41:15.390 --> 41:19.352
Kinda. He can't say a lot of words yet
but he understands things pretty good.

41:19.519 --> 41:20.729
Oh, yeah. I see.

41:25.400 --> 41:28.069
He needs food and shelter.

41:40.916 --> 41:44.085
You got plenty of room here.
This place is perfect.

41:44.252 --> 41:45.462
<i>Go away.</i>

41:45.629 --> 41:49.090
I can have him push the door down.
You know I can.

41:49.257 --> 41:51.593
Hogarth. I can't hide it here.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.762
- "Him," not "it."
<i>- Whatever.</i>

41:53.929 --> 41:56.139
You don't even know where "he" came from

41:56.306 --> 41:58.558
or, or what the hell "he" is!

41:58.725 --> 42:00.435
He's my friend.

42:01.394 --> 42:04.105
Yeah, what am I? Am I your friend?

42:04.272 --> 42:06.441
Bring some Franken-bot with
out-of-state plates over here,

42:06.608 --> 42:08.443
make me change my tune.

42:08.610 --> 42:11.446
I don't like that jazz. God, I'm tired.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.448
So, he can stay?

42:13.615 --> 42:17.577
Tonight. Tomorrow, I don't know.
I don't know about tomorrow.

42:26.628 --> 42:28.296
Sleep tight.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.465
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:44.646 --> 42:46.815
- You're up already?
- Just making the bed.

42:46.982 --> 42:50.694
That's nice. Come downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

42:55.323 --> 42:57.867
Morning, sport. Sleep well?

42:58.034 --> 42:59.661
Mom?

43:00.328 --> 43:03.665
Isn't it wonderful, Hogarth?
We finally rented our room.

43:03.832 --> 43:06.543
Ugh. I'm not very hungry.

43:13.842 --> 43:16.344
Oh, yeah.

43:18.346 --> 43:20.390
Hello, this is Hogarth Hughes speaking.
Who's calling, please?

43:20.557 --> 43:23.018
I said he could stay the night, kid.

43:23.184 --> 43:24.227
It's morning now.

43:24.394 --> 43:26.396
Look, I'll try
to come over, okay?

43:26.563 --> 43:28.857
But there's this weird guy here
who's watching me.

43:29.024 --> 43:30.150
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

43:30.317 --> 43:33.862
I got this big, giant...
Giant thing out here.

43:34.029 --> 43:36.865
- I can't talk right now, okay? Bye.
<i>- Hogarth!</i>

43:37.032 --> 43:38.908
Who was that, sport? Friend of yours?

43:39.075 --> 43:41.244
Yeah. He's, uh, a new kid.

43:41.578 --> 43:46.207
What... I...
Hey, hey! Stop! Stop that! Stop it!

43:47.584 --> 43:50.337
Hey, mind if I ask you a few
questions there, buckaroo?

43:50.503 --> 43:53.548
Now, why would you tell your mom
about a giant robot, slugger?

43:53.715 --> 43:55.383
Say, what'd you see at the power station?
Huh, tiger?

43:55.550 --> 43:57.886
You tell anyone else about this, buddy?
How big is this thing, ranger?

43:58.053 --> 43:59.346
Been in the forest lately?
Hey. Where you going?

43:59.512 --> 44:01.181
Champ? Slugger? Hey, cowboy?
Where you goin'?

44:01.348 --> 44:03.725
- Where you goin'?
- I'm going out!

44:03.892 --> 44:06.853
Why don't you take Mr. Mansley with you?
Show him the sights.

44:07.020 --> 44:08.897
Oh, Mom, the sights?

44:09.064 --> 44:11.066
Hey, I'd love that. Give us a chance
to get acquainted,

44:11.232 --> 44:12.692
swap some stories, huh, chief?

44:12.859 --> 44:14.944
There are two kinds of metal in this yard.

44:15.111 --> 44:16.738
Scrap and art.

44:16.905 --> 44:19.240
If you gotta eat one of them,
eat the scrap.

44:19.407 --> 44:23.870
What you currently have
in your mouth is art!

44:27.540 --> 44:28.583
Art?

44:34.714 --> 44:36.591
Oh, forget it. Forget it!

44:36.758 --> 44:39.886
It's gone. It's...

44:40.053 --> 44:42.889
Hmm. That's not bad.

44:46.226 --> 44:49.062
First, you take
a chocolate bar. Any bar'll do.

44:49.229 --> 44:50.772
- Oh.
- Do you mind if I, uh...

44:50.939 --> 44:52.440
No, knock yourself out, skipper.

44:53.233 --> 44:56.236
You crumble up the chocolate
into little pieces.

44:56.403 --> 44:59.781
Then you kind of stir it
into the ice cream. See?

44:59.948 --> 45:02.075
Yes, I see. What do you call this again?

45:02.242 --> 45:04.828
Landslide. It's new. Very new.

45:04.994 --> 45:10.458
Mmm. Landslide. Topnotch. Mmm.

45:10.625 --> 45:15.296
You know, Hogarth, we live
in a strange and wondrous time.

45:15.463 --> 45:17.132
The Atomic Age.

45:17.298 --> 45:20.260
But there's a dark side
to progress, Hogarth.

45:20.427 --> 45:21.970
Ever hear of <i>Sputnik?</i>

45:22.137 --> 45:24.514
Yeah, it's the first satellite in space.

45:24.806 --> 45:28.476
Foreign satellite, Hogarth,
and all that that implies.

45:28.643 --> 45:31.312
Even now, it orbits overhead.

45:31.479 --> 45:33.106
Boop. Boop.

45:33.273 --> 45:35.150
Watching us.

45:35.316 --> 45:37.318
We can't see it, but it's there.

45:37.485 --> 45:39.988
Much like that giant thing in the woods.

45:40.321 --> 45:42.157
We don't know what it is
or what it can do.

45:42.323 --> 45:44.033
I don't feel safe, Hogarth.

45:44.200 --> 45:46.494
- Do you?
- What are you talking about?

45:46.661 --> 45:50.290
What am I talking about?
What am I talking about?

45:50.665 --> 45:53.168
I'm talking about
your goldarned security, Hogarth!

45:53.334 --> 45:55.170
While you're snoozing
in your little jammies,

45:55.336 --> 45:57.797
back in Washington,
we're wide-awake and worried. Why?

45:57.964 --> 46:00.842
Because everyone wants
what we have, Hogarth! Everyone!

46:01.009 --> 46:02.969
You think this metal man is fun.
But who built it?

46:03.136 --> 46:06.681
The Russians? The Chinese? Martians?
Canadians? I don't care!

46:06.848 --> 46:09.184
All I know is, we didn't build it,
and that's reason enough

46:09.350 --> 46:12.020
to assume the worst
and blow it to kingdom come!

46:12.187 --> 46:15.523
Now, you're going to tell me about
this thing. You're gonna lead me to it.

46:15.690 --> 46:18.151
And we are going to destroy it
before it destroys us!

46:20.820 --> 46:22.238
Just hold that thought
and stay right there.

46:22.405 --> 46:23.907
Oh-oh.

46:29.996 --> 46:31.748
<i>Little lower. Little bit lower...</i>

46:31.915 --> 46:34.542
Hey. I thought you were in trouble.

46:34.709 --> 46:36.085
That sucks.
Let me just... Up a little.

46:36.252 --> 46:39.005
I had to ditch this weird guy
who's staying at our house.

46:39.172 --> 46:41.216
It took me hours to shake him!

46:41.382 --> 46:43.343
I kill myself to get out here!

46:43.510 --> 46:47.055
And you have him doing... Arts and crafts!

46:47.222 --> 46:50.016
You got a problem with
arts and crafts, little man?

46:50.183 --> 46:54.103
He's a giant robot, Dean.
It's a little undignified.

46:54.270 --> 46:57.732
Yeah? Well, smart guy,
what would you have him do?

47:01.110 --> 47:04.739
Main systems on. Main engines.

47:04.906 --> 47:06.574
One, two and three.

47:06.741 --> 47:12.413
All systems go.
Five, four, three two, one!

47:12.580 --> 47:13.873
Blast off!

47:24.926 --> 47:27.303
We're landing. We're landing!

47:27.470 --> 47:29.889
We're landing!

47:35.812 --> 47:38.273
Say, can you guys
cool yourselves a little?

47:38.439 --> 47:40.275
I feel like we're pressing our luck here.

47:40.441 --> 47:42.443
Hey, baby, we are cool!

47:42.610 --> 47:45.446
Welcome to downtown Coolsville.

47:45.613 --> 47:47.615
Population? Us.

47:47.782 --> 47:52.787
Well, can you move Coolsville
to someplace less conspicuous?

47:52.954 --> 47:55.915
- How about the lake?
- Okay.

47:56.082 --> 47:58.793
Aw, come with us. It'll be fun.

48:49.552 --> 48:53.514
This can't last forever, Hogarth.
We gotta tell somebody about him.

48:53.681 --> 48:55.516
Ah, you worry too much.

48:58.394 --> 49:01.356
Hey, Dean! Watch this!

49:01.522 --> 49:03.691
All right, we're watching. We're watching.

49:03.858 --> 49:07.028
This one's for professionals only!

49:08.863 --> 49:10.365
Banzai!

49:15.870 --> 49:19.165
Come on in!

49:19.332 --> 49:22.001
The water's great!

49:22.168 --> 49:24.045
No, thanks.

49:24.212 --> 49:26.214
You weenie!

49:27.882 --> 49:28.925
Come on in.

49:29.092 --> 49:32.178
It's really, really refreshing.

49:39.394 --> 49:41.938
What? You too?

49:42.105 --> 49:45.400
You big baby!

49:50.780 --> 49:52.740
Banzai!

50:24.814 --> 50:26.774
Whoo!

50:30.737 --> 50:32.280
- Hey.
- Yeah?

50:32.447 --> 50:35.324
- You're right in the middle of the road!
- Yeah?

50:35.491 --> 50:36.617
All right.

50:40.288 --> 50:43.958
I think that's enough fun for one day.

50:58.473 --> 51:00.475
<i>Are you okay in there,
Mr. Mansley?</i>

51:00.641 --> 51:02.268
<i>I'm back with the toilet paper you needed.</i>

51:02.435 --> 51:06.147
Thanks!
I think I'm feeling better now.

51:06.314 --> 51:08.941
Much. Much better.

51:16.949 --> 51:18.993
It's beautiful, huh?

51:19.160 --> 51:20.828
Hey, look!

51:22.497 --> 51:24.332
It's a deer.

51:24.499 --> 51:25.708
- Deer?
- Shh.

51:25.875 --> 51:27.502
Let's get closer.

52:00.576 --> 52:02.745
Hmm. Well, I guess he decided to...

52:11.712 --> 52:13.756
It's the monster!

52:16.843 --> 52:18.219
Oh, no.

52:25.893 --> 52:28.104
It's dead.

52:30.565 --> 52:31.732
Dead?

52:34.902 --> 52:36.362
Don't do that!

52:38.239 --> 52:39.407
Why?

52:39.574 --> 52:42.368
It's dead. Understand?

52:42.535 --> 52:45.913
They shot it with that gun.

52:54.964 --> 52:56.424
<i>Hey, what's wrong?</i>

52:58.426 --> 53:01.637
- Guns.
- Yes. Guns kill.

53:02.763 --> 53:05.433
Guns kill.

53:30.291 --> 53:34.754
I know you feel bad about the deer.
But it's not your fault.

53:34.921 --> 53:36.422
Things die.

53:36.589 --> 53:38.424
It's part of life.

53:38.591 --> 53:40.760
It's bad to kill.

53:40.927 --> 53:42.970
But it's not bad to die.

53:43.512 --> 53:45.681
You die?

53:45.848 --> 53:50.645
Well, yes, someday.

53:50.811 --> 53:53.105
I die?

53:53.272 --> 53:54.982
I don't know.

53:55.149 --> 53:59.612
You're made of metal
but you have feelings.

53:59.779 --> 54:01.822
And you think about things.

54:01.989 --> 54:05.034
And that means you have a soul.

54:05.201 --> 54:07.954
And souls don't die.

54:08.120 --> 54:09.997
Soul?

54:10.164 --> 54:14.168
Mom says it's something inside
of all good things,

54:14.335 --> 54:16.963
and that it goes on forever and ever.

54:31.686 --> 54:35.189
Souls don't die.

54:48.244 --> 54:50.204
<i>You're very kind. Thank you so much.</i>

54:52.081 --> 54:55.042
<i>You ever seen a better picture than that?
Look at those details.</i>

54:55.209 --> 54:58.879
<i>This is the famous 60 second
Polaroid land camera.</i>

54:59.255 --> 55:00.381
<i>Seeing the results on the spot...</i>

55:08.389 --> 55:09.598
<i>In 60 seconds...</i>

55:11.392 --> 55:15.062
<i>You know, if you...</i>

55:16.021 --> 55:17.565
<i>Don't you remember anything?</i>

55:25.614 --> 55:27.867
<i>You saw me save you.</i>

55:29.118 --> 55:31.829
<i>You came from the sky, right?</i>

55:35.916 --> 55:38.252
<i>You don't even know
where "he" came from.</i>

55:38.419 --> 55:41.255
<i>Or what the hell "he" is!</i>

55:48.095 --> 55:50.097
<i>Guess you're not gonna hurt me.</i>

56:12.953 --> 56:14.580
<i>You're late for dinner, Hogarth.</i>

56:17.625 --> 56:19.919
Your mom's working late tonight, Hogarth.

56:20.252 --> 56:21.545
So it's just us guys.

56:21.712 --> 56:24.465
And we're gonna have a little chat.
Sit down!

56:25.966 --> 56:29.595
<i>How's that? A little too bright? Good.</i>

56:31.555 --> 56:34.934
<i>Forgive me, Hogarth.
I wanted you to learn something.</i>

56:35.100 --> 56:36.811
What can I learn from you?

56:36.977 --> 56:38.145
You can learn this, Hogarth.

56:38.312 --> 56:40.481
That I can do anything I want,
whenever I want,

56:40.648 --> 56:42.942
if I feel it's in
the people's best interest.

56:43.108 --> 56:45.236
The giant metal man, where is it?

56:45.402 --> 56:47.988
I don't know what you're talking about.

56:48.155 --> 56:49.990
You don't? Well.

56:51.659 --> 56:53.577
<i>Does this ring a bell?</i>

56:54.411 --> 56:55.621
<i>No?</i>

56:55.788 --> 56:57.164
<i>How about this?</i>

56:58.457 --> 57:00.334
<i>You've been careless, Hogarth.</i>

57:00.501 --> 57:01.836
It doesn't prove anything.

57:02.002 --> 57:04.588
<i>It's enough to get the Army here
with one phone call.</i>

57:04.755 --> 57:07.675
- Then what's stopping you?
- Where's the giant?

57:07.842 --> 57:10.135
You can't protect him, Hogarth,

57:10.302 --> 57:13.681
any more than you can
protect your mother.

57:13.848 --> 57:15.015
My mom?

57:15.182 --> 57:17.643
Ah, it's difficult
to raise a boy all alone.

57:17.810 --> 57:19.186
We can make it more difficult.

57:19.353 --> 57:21.355
In fact, we can make it so difficult

57:21.522 --> 57:24.692
that it would be irresponsible
for us to leave you in her care

57:24.859 --> 57:26.819
and all that that implies.

57:26.986 --> 57:29.697
<i>- You'll be taken away from her, Hogarth.</i>
- You can't do that!

57:29.864 --> 57:32.491
Oh, we can. And we will.

57:36.537 --> 57:38.622
He's in the junkyard.

57:38.789 --> 57:41.041
McCoppin's Scrap, off Culver Road.

57:41.208 --> 57:45.713
The junkyard. Of course!
Food for the metal-eater.

57:46.046 --> 57:49.884
I wouldn't worry about this, Hogarth.
It isn't really happening.

57:50.050 --> 57:52.344
<i>This is only a bad dream.</i>

57:56.223 --> 57:59.727
<i>Where's the giant?</i>

57:59.894 --> 58:02.730
<i>This is only a bad dream.</i>

58:02.897 --> 58:04.231
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

58:04.398 --> 58:05.816
<i>This thing is real, sir.</i>

58:05.983 --> 58:08.861
<i>I not only have incontrovertible
evidence, General,</i>

58:09.028 --> 58:10.738
<i>I know where it's hidden.</i>

58:10.905 --> 58:12.239
<i>I don't know who built it, but it's here.</i>

58:12.406 --> 58:14.992
<i>It's massive
and we're running out of time.</i>

58:15.159 --> 58:17.912
<i>There's no doubt we should act.
The only question, sir, is...</i>

58:18.078 --> 58:20.414
<i>Can you afford not to?</i>

58:20.581 --> 58:24.585
Excellent, sir. You won't regret it.
Thank you, sir.

58:35.262 --> 58:39.058
The Army arrives in the morning, Hogarth.
Don't get cute.

58:44.438 --> 58:45.940
I gotta warn Dean.

58:56.867 --> 58:59.286
I'll be watching you.

1:00:17.364 --> 1:00:18.615
Morning, Kent.

1:00:26.874 --> 1:00:31.378
For some reason, the Army
is in our front yard, Mr. Mansley.

1:00:31.545 --> 1:00:33.672
Please, call me Kent.

1:00:41.221 --> 1:00:43.515
Okay.

1:00:59.698 --> 1:01:01.909
- All right, where is it?
- What?

1:01:02.076 --> 1:01:04.036
You know darn well what. The monster.

1:01:04.203 --> 1:01:07.372
The giant thing. The metal man.

1:01:08.665 --> 1:01:13.545
Ah, the metal man. Jeez, you were
scaring me there for a second.

1:01:13.712 --> 1:01:16.757
I thought I was under attack or something.

1:01:16.924 --> 1:01:18.175
He's in the back.

1:01:18.342 --> 1:01:20.260
Come on. I'll show you.

1:01:25.766 --> 1:01:27.935
You guys got here just in time.

1:01:28.102 --> 1:01:30.896
This rich cat,
you know, some industrialist,

1:01:31.063 --> 1:01:33.357
wants him for the lobby of his company.

1:01:33.524 --> 1:01:35.442
He whipped out his checkbook on the spot.

1:01:35.609 --> 1:01:38.946
I said, "Hey, you got him
for the rest of your life.

1:01:39.113 --> 1:01:43.200
"But, what, I gotta let go the moment
I give birth? I mean, come on.

1:01:43.367 --> 1:01:45.619
"Give me some time
to cut the umbilical, man."

1:01:47.037 --> 1:01:48.539
Here he is.

1:01:54.878 --> 1:01:56.213
<i>Anyway, I haven't sold him yet.</i>

1:01:56.380 --> 1:02:00.801
So if you really want him and if,
you know, you throw in

1:02:00.968 --> 1:02:03.137
a competitive bid...

1:02:03.303 --> 1:02:05.055
Sir, I... Listen... Sir, listen...

1:02:05.222 --> 1:02:07.474
- Step outside, Mansley.
- Yes.

1:02:07.975 --> 1:02:10.811
You realize how much hardware
I brought out here?

1:02:10.978 --> 1:02:15.065
<i>You just blew millions of Uncle Sam's
dollars out of your butt!</i>

1:02:15.232 --> 1:02:17.985
I gotta admit, I'm relieved that

1:02:18.152 --> 1:02:20.487
this is what Hogarth was talking about.

1:02:20.654 --> 1:02:23.949
I mean, I was beginning to, um,
think it was real.

1:02:24.116 --> 1:02:27.828
I mean, don't get me wrong, I like it.

1:02:27.995 --> 1:02:30.831
But, uh, do you need all this stuff
on the surface?

1:02:30.998 --> 1:02:34.501
Well, um, no, actually.

1:02:34.668 --> 1:02:37.671
It just sort of...
It seems kind of slapped on.

1:02:37.838 --> 1:02:40.132
You know, not as thought-out
as this other piece.

1:02:40.299 --> 1:02:43.010
- You like that one?
- Yeah.

1:02:44.636 --> 1:02:46.638
You'll be chief inspector
of subway toilets

1:02:46.805 --> 1:02:48.515
by the time I'm finished with you!

1:02:48.682 --> 1:02:53.020
Now, pack up. I'll expect you back
in Washington to clear out your office.

1:02:53.187 --> 1:02:54.479
Yes, sir.

1:02:57.191 --> 1:02:59.651
Hmm. I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.

1:02:59.818 --> 1:03:02.029
You mean, you know about that?

1:03:02.321 --> 1:03:04.156
Aw. Now I do.

1:03:18.337 --> 1:03:22.049
Bye, Kent, and all that that implies.

1:03:22.216 --> 1:03:23.800
<i>Okay, you can move now.</i>

1:03:25.385 --> 1:03:26.720
Nice job!

1:03:32.059 --> 1:03:33.727
Thruster to base.

1:03:33.894 --> 1:03:35.562
I'm goin' in.

1:03:35.729 --> 1:03:38.732
Only one creature could create
so much destruction.

1:03:38.899 --> 1:03:40.692
The hideous, people-eating,

1:03:40.859 --> 1:03:44.196
killing machine, Atomo!

1:03:45.697 --> 1:03:47.574
Atomo?

1:03:47.741 --> 1:03:49.743
No Atomo.

1:03:58.168 --> 1:04:00.087
I Superman.

1:04:00.254 --> 1:04:02.339
Okay, Superman.

1:04:02.506 --> 1:04:03.757
Take this!

1:04:07.761 --> 1:04:09.096
<i>Stupid gun.</i>

1:04:22.067 --> 1:04:23.735
Hey. What's wrong?

1:04:26.405 --> 1:04:28.907
As I was saying, take this!

1:04:32.577 --> 1:04:33.954
Oh!

1:04:35.122 --> 1:04:36.290
What happened? What was that...

1:04:36.456 --> 1:04:38.875
Shh. Stay down and follow me.

1:04:43.088 --> 1:04:44.464
Shh.

1:04:45.465 --> 1:04:46.800
Get back!

1:04:49.636 --> 1:04:51.972
I said, get back! I mean it!

1:04:52.806 --> 1:04:54.808
No, stop. Why?

1:04:54.975 --> 1:04:57.144
It was an accident. He's our friend.

1:04:57.311 --> 1:05:01.106
He's a piece of hardware, Hogarth.
Why do you think the Army was here?

1:05:01.273 --> 1:05:04.735
He's a weapon! A big gun that walks!

1:05:06.820 --> 1:05:08.322
I, I...

1:05:08.488 --> 1:05:09.990
I not gun.

1:05:10.157 --> 1:05:11.992
Yeah, what's that, huh?

1:05:12.492 --> 1:05:15.162
You almost did that to Hogarth!

1:05:16.330 --> 1:05:17.664
No.

1:05:21.251 --> 1:05:22.669
- Come back!
- Hogarth.

1:05:22.836 --> 1:05:24.463
- Hey, stop!
- Giant!

1:05:24.629 --> 1:05:26.131
Come back!

1:05:30.427 --> 1:05:32.012
It was defensive.

1:05:32.179 --> 1:05:34.431
He reacted to the gun.

1:05:37.642 --> 1:05:39.853
You're not gonna
get there fast enough on foot.

1:05:59.706 --> 1:06:02.209
See, I told you it was a big hoax.

1:06:02.376 --> 1:06:04.002
- Dad said...
- Give me the binoculars.

1:06:04.169 --> 1:06:06.630
- What? What?
- Hey, there it is. I see it!

1:06:07.714 --> 1:06:09.633
It's big. It's walking away.

1:06:09.800 --> 1:06:11.968
- Hey. Gimme those.
- Over there. See it?

1:06:12.135 --> 1:06:13.553
The monster! Holy cow!

1:06:15.222 --> 1:06:16.390
Watch it!

1:06:16.556 --> 1:06:17.891
Help!

1:06:18.058 --> 1:06:19.893
Somebody help me!

1:06:20.560 --> 1:06:22.062
- I don't wanna fall!
- Help!

1:06:24.356 --> 1:06:25.482
I'm slipping!

1:06:25.649 --> 1:06:27.901
<i>I can't hold on much longer!</i>

1:06:36.910 --> 1:06:38.412
- Dad!
- Daddy!

1:06:40.914 --> 1:06:43.542
- He saved those boys!
- It's friendly!

1:06:58.056 --> 1:07:00.183
What...

1:07:02.936 --> 1:07:04.229
Oh!

1:07:05.939 --> 1:07:07.107
Stop! Look!

1:07:07.274 --> 1:07:09.776
Look behind you!
The giant, it's attacking!

1:07:09.943 --> 1:07:11.736
<i>It's stomping the town! I was right!</i>

1:07:11.903 --> 1:07:14.906
- Sweet mother of God.
<i>- Look, damn you!</i>

1:07:22.622 --> 1:07:25.792
I am not a gun.

1:07:33.884 --> 1:07:35.760
Hey, Mom.

1:07:49.316 --> 1:07:50.567
Let's get out of here!

1:07:50.734 --> 1:07:51.902
Run!

1:08:03.246 --> 1:08:05.790
Hey. Stop! There's a kid in his hands!

1:08:05.957 --> 1:08:07.334
<i>Stop shooting!</i>

1:08:08.335 --> 1:08:10.629
Kent! He only reacts defensively.

1:08:10.795 --> 1:08:14.007
If you don't shoot, he's harmless.
You gotta tell the General!

1:08:14.174 --> 1:08:16.301
This is all your fault, beatnik.
If you hadn't...

1:08:16.468 --> 1:08:17.636
Would you shut up and listen?

1:08:17.802 --> 1:08:21.139
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid with him.

1:08:22.182 --> 1:08:23.350
I'll take care of it.

1:08:28.813 --> 1:08:33.276
He says the monster's killed a kid.
Sir, we must stop it at all costs.

1:08:33.443 --> 1:08:35.862
Go to code red. Repeat, code red!

1:08:37.322 --> 1:08:39.991
Mr. President, we have a situation, sir.

1:08:46.331 --> 1:08:48.625
Watch it, lady!

1:09:01.012 --> 1:09:03.139
Look out for the bus!

1:09:17.404 --> 1:09:18.905
You can fly?

1:09:20.865 --> 1:09:22.659
You can fly!

1:09:28.582 --> 1:09:29.916
Hogarth!

1:09:31.376 --> 1:09:34.546
Try pointing your arms straight ahead,
like Superman!

1:09:52.897 --> 1:09:54.524
No, no!

1:10:01.197 --> 1:10:03.533
I've lost visual. Repeat, lost visual!

1:10:08.455 --> 1:10:10.624
Man, that was close!

1:10:13.877 --> 1:10:15.128
No!

1:10:17.213 --> 1:10:19.257
Ha. Gotcha!

1:10:36.900 --> 1:10:38.818
Good call, Mansley.

1:10:38.985 --> 1:10:43.657
Secure the area. Let's find out
what this thing is and who sent it.

1:10:50.455 --> 1:10:51.581
Huh?

1:11:06.638 --> 1:11:08.473
Halt! Set your perimeter!

1:11:09.766 --> 1:11:12.185
- It's still alive!
- Shoot at it!

1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:36.876
<i>Retreat! Retreat!</i>

1:11:38.795 --> 1:11:40.505
Let's get out of here!

1:11:50.348 --> 1:11:51.975
Hogarth!

1:11:53.393 --> 1:11:56.354
He's unconscious, but he's okay.
Let's get him in the car.

1:11:56.730 --> 1:11:59.524
Drive, baby, drive! Step on it! Floor it!

1:11:59.691 --> 1:12:03.236
It's gaining on us. Faster! Faster! Hurry!

1:12:13.204 --> 1:12:15.039
All battleships fire at the robot!

1:12:15.206 --> 1:12:16.374
Now!

1:12:16.541 --> 1:12:18.168
Now, damn it, now!

1:12:26.426 --> 1:12:29.387
Nothing can stop this thing!
We've hit it with everything we've got!

1:12:29.554 --> 1:12:31.514
Not everything, General. The bomb.

1:12:33.224 --> 1:12:35.894
The <i>Nautilus</i> has first strike capability
and is not far offshore.

1:12:36.895 --> 1:12:38.188
You scare me, Mansley.

1:12:38.354 --> 1:12:41.107
You want us to bomb ourselves
in order to kill it?

1:12:41.274 --> 1:12:43.610
General, the giant seems to follow
whatever attacks it.

1:12:43.777 --> 1:12:46.529
We can lure it away from the town,
then destroy it.

1:12:48.281 --> 1:12:51.910
Radio the <i>Nautilus.</i> Tell them to target
the robot and await my command.

1:12:53.703 --> 1:12:56.122
This is <i>Nautilus.</i>
What is the giant's current position?

1:12:56.289 --> 1:12:58.958
<i>67. 71972 degrees west,</i>

1:12:59.125 --> 1:13:02.128
<i>by 44.50177 degrees north.</i>

1:13:02.295 --> 1:13:03.421
Locked and loaded.

1:13:03.630 --> 1:13:05.298
Oh, my baby, I'm so sorry.

1:13:05.465 --> 1:13:07.759
- Stop the car.
- Hogarth! My God, honey, you're all right.

1:13:07.926 --> 1:13:09.469
Go back! We've gotta help him!

1:13:09.636 --> 1:13:11.930
Are you crazy, kid?
You're lucky to be alive!

1:13:12.096 --> 1:13:13.640
We're taking you to a hospital.

1:13:19.646 --> 1:13:21.648
Everyone! Out of the car!
We're evacuating the area.

1:13:21.815 --> 1:13:23.900
What are you talking about?
We gotta get this boy to a hospital.

1:13:24.067 --> 1:13:25.235
What boy?

1:13:25.902 --> 1:13:27.111
Hogarth!

1:13:30.949 --> 1:13:32.283
Hogarth, no!

1:13:42.502 --> 1:13:45.004
Hey! No! Stop!

1:13:56.307 --> 1:13:57.600
This is General Rogard.

1:13:57.767 --> 1:14:00.353
Ready the attack and prepare
to retreat to the fallback position.

1:14:00.520 --> 1:14:04.023
No! No! Stop! My son is out there!

1:14:06.609 --> 1:14:10.029
No, wait. It's me, Hogarth. Remember?

1:14:10.697 --> 1:14:14.659
It's bad to kill. Guns kill.

1:14:14.826 --> 1:14:17.161
<i>And you don't have to be a gun.</i>

1:14:17.620 --> 1:14:20.164
You are what you choose to be.

1:14:20.790 --> 1:14:22.750
You choose.

1:14:23.668 --> 1:14:25.003
Choose.

1:14:26.254 --> 1:14:28.423
Hogarth.

1:14:36.222 --> 1:14:37.724
It's okay. It's okay.

1:14:38.099 --> 1:14:40.184
We gotta show them you're good.

1:14:44.188 --> 1:14:46.190
<i>Nautilus</i> to Rogard,
missile armed and ready.

1:14:46.357 --> 1:14:47.984
What are you saying, he's friendly?

1:14:48.151 --> 1:14:50.695
Yes. Attacking him is triggering
a defense mechanism.

1:14:50.862 --> 1:14:53.615
Don't listen, General! Destroy the monster
while we still have the chance!

1:14:56.075 --> 1:14:58.369
General, you shoot and the whole thing
starts all over again.

1:14:58.536 --> 1:15:01.122
- Stop it now! Our future's at stake!
- Orders, sir?

1:15:01.289 --> 1:15:03.374
Which is why you have
got to stop, General!

1:15:03.541 --> 1:15:06.794
- It's getting closer! Orders, sir?
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1:15:06.961 --> 1:15:09.547
- Hogarth!
- Hold your fire! The boy's alive?

1:15:09.714 --> 1:15:10.965
It's a trick! Launch the missile.

1:15:11.132 --> 1:15:13.009
Are you mad, Mansley?

1:15:13.176 --> 1:15:14.802
All units, stand down!

1:15:14.969 --> 1:15:17.013
Rogard to <i>Nautilus.</i> Come in, <i>Nautilus.</i>

1:15:17.180 --> 1:15:18.973
<i>This is</i> Nautilus <i>standing by.</i>

1:15:19.140 --> 1:15:20.391
Launch the missile now!

1:15:28.232 --> 1:15:31.110
That missile is targeted
to the giant's current position!

1:15:31.569 --> 1:15:33.321
Where's the giant, Mansley?

1:15:33.905 --> 1:15:37.492
What... Oh...

1:15:37.659 --> 1:15:40.078
We can duck and cover.
There's a fallout shelter right there.

1:15:40.244 --> 1:15:42.914
There's no way to survive this, you idiot!

1:15:43.081 --> 1:15:44.958
You mean, we're all going to...

1:15:45.124 --> 1:15:48.503
To die, Mansley, for our country.

1:15:49.587 --> 1:15:52.674
Screw our country! I want to live!

1:15:58.137 --> 1:15:59.263
<i>Hold him, men.</i>

1:15:59.430 --> 1:16:02.642
Make sure he stays here,
like a good soldier.

1:16:06.604 --> 1:16:07.772
Oh!

1:16:10.733 --> 1:16:13.277
Oh, no.

1:16:16.155 --> 1:16:18.491
- Hmm?
- It's a missile.

1:16:18.658 --> 1:16:23.037
When it comes down
everyone will die.

1:16:23.204 --> 1:16:24.580
There it is!

1:16:40.763 --> 1:16:43.683
- Shouldn't we get to a shelter?
- It wouldn't matter.

1:16:44.308 --> 1:16:46.477
<i>I fix.</i>

1:16:53.151 --> 1:16:54.444
Giant?

1:16:58.614 --> 1:17:00.158
Hogarth.

1:17:01.284 --> 1:17:03.911
You stay.

1:17:04.829 --> 1:17:07.540
I go.

1:17:12.503 --> 1:17:16.049
No following.

1:17:25.600 --> 1:17:26.934
I love you.

1:17:55.421 --> 1:17:57.298
<i>You are who you choose to be.</i>

1:18:00.259 --> 1:18:02.637
Superman.

1:18:34.585 --> 1:18:36.045
Let's go home.

1:19:22.967 --> 1:19:26.095
Your best work yet, honey.
No doubt about it.

1:19:26.262 --> 1:19:28.639
You think this is my best? Really?

1:19:28.806 --> 1:19:32.602
Well, you know,
next to that bug, uh, thing.

1:19:32.768 --> 1:19:36.105
You know, the one with the, uh, shovels...

1:19:36.272 --> 1:19:40.234
Um, Hogarth?
Come on, honey. Time to go.

1:19:40.401 --> 1:19:43.154
- See you later, guys.
- See you later, Hogarth.

1:19:43.321 --> 1:19:45.740
Oh, hey, Hogarth, um,
the General sent this to you.

1:19:45.907 --> 1:19:47.116
What is it?

1:19:47.283 --> 1:19:49.660
He said it was
the only part recovered.

1:19:50.077 --> 1:19:52.121
<i>He thought you should have it.</i>

1:19:54.081 --> 1:19:55.666
I miss him.

1:20:44.882 --> 1:20:46.342
See you later!

1:29:55.307 --> 1:29:56.308
