13:40.529 --> 13:43.573
Just stand down and we can talk this over.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.264
[shouting]

14:09.891 --> 14:11.392
[panting]

14:11.393 --> 14:13.979
[sighs]

14:16.064 --> 14:19.400
[exhales] Is that all you got?

14:19.401 --> 14:22.404
Why did you have to ask that, kid?

14:23.238 --> 14:25.323
[intense music playing]

14:29.411 --> 14:30.704
You happy?

14:32.455 --> 14:33.873
Now stop.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.627
Not until you admit to everyone
what you've done.

14:39.629 --> 14:42.549
Mark, I don't want to hurt you.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.135
I'm not the one who's gonna get hurt.

14:46.136 --> 14:48.053
You said you don't do threats.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.597
Yeah.

14:49.598 --> 14:51.265
[all snarling]

14:51.266 --> 14:53.393
Well, people change.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.231
Don't, Mark. I'm warning you.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.028
[grunting]

15:05.530 --> 15:07.407
- [high-pitched shrieking tone]
- [Mark shouting]

15:09.159 --> 15:10.659
[whimpering]

15:10.660 --> 15:13.579
Remember that giant lobster
you tangled with in Atlantis?

15:13.580 --> 15:16.624
I had the lab boys
recreate the sound it made.

15:16.625 --> 15:19.209
Turns out we can transmit it
to your earpiece.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.629
[grunting]

15:21.921 --> 15:23.380
Not that earpiece.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.050
The one we implanted
when you were in our hospital.

15:26.051 --> 15:28.177
The one too deep to reach.

15:28.178 --> 15:29.428
[shrieking tone stops]

15:29.429 --> 15:30.679
[exhales]

15:30.680 --> 15:33.182
So be reasonable, Mark.

15:33.183 --> 15:34.516
Go home.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.312
We are so far past reasonable.

15:39.522 --> 15:40.440
Jesus!

15:43.526 --> 15:45.654
- [shrieking tone]
- Aah!

15:54.454 --> 15:58.165
[Cecil] Apart from causing you pain,
the sound also messes up your inner ear.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.668
Which you need for things like flying.

16:00.669 --> 16:02.419
Or walking.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.338
You put a weapon inside me?

16:04.339 --> 16:06.423
With what you can do,

16:06.424 --> 16:08.384
and after what your dad put us through,

16:08.385 --> 16:11.053
you're goddamn right I did.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.805
I hoped I'd never have to use it, but--

16:12.806 --> 16:14.890
You said I wasn't my dad.

16:14.891 --> 16:16.934
Did you even believe that?

16:16.935 --> 16:19.103
Yes, Mark, and I still do.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.731
So stop being stupid and just...

16:22.857 --> 16:25.025
...come back here.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.528
Track him.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.243
The kid's off leash.

16:34.244 --> 16:37.414
I don't want to bring him down
if I don't know where he's going to hit.

16:39.791 --> 16:41.835
[grunting]

16:43.545 --> 16:44.586
Shit.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.715
We can't have them involved.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.425
[shrieking tone]

16:49.426 --> 16:51.511
[grunting]

16:54.013 --> 16:56.014
That sucked.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.810
I still can't believe
we got our asses kicked by Doc Seismic.

16:59.811 --> 17:01.937
At least it wasn't just us.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.814
[Rae] Could be worse.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.774
We could be stuck
mopping up with the others.

17:05.775 --> 17:07.025
[Rex sighs]

17:07.026 --> 17:09.653
I think we all need a drink after that.

17:09.654 --> 17:12.489
You gonna add a shirt to those pants?

17:12.490 --> 17:14.450
Uh, I don't know. Are you gonna--

17:14.451 --> 17:16.494
Oh, you know, wait.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.164
That's the old me.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.958
The new me takes your feedback.

17:22.959 --> 17:26.378
And thanks you
for your constructive criticism.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.714
Before ignoring it complete--

17:28.715 --> 17:31.216
Aah! Holy shit!

17:31.217 --> 17:33.135
Mark?

17:33.136 --> 17:35.179
Rudy, there's a thing in my head.

17:35.180 --> 17:37.264
You got to get it out
before Cecil finds me.

17:37.265 --> 17:39.349
Cecil? I-I don't understand.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.851
Everyone step back.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.186
This has nothing to do with you.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.022
He's trying to kill me.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.523
What?

17:46.524 --> 17:49.026
For fuck's sake,
I'm not trying to kill the kid.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.154
But he needs to come with me.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.033
D.A. Sinclair slaughtered students.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.494
Darkwing killed people in cold blood.

17:58.495 --> 18:00.454
Cecil's working with murderers.

18:00.455 --> 18:01.955
You all saw it.

18:01.956 --> 18:03.957
We're not having this argument here.

18:03.958 --> 18:06.210
I'd like to hear
what Invincible has to say.

18:06.211 --> 18:08.337
This isn't a democracy, Bulletproof.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.506
You're coming back to the GDA with me.

18:10.507 --> 18:11.965
- Now.
- [Mark] No.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.842
I'd never come out again.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.511
Don't be so goddamn dramatic.

18:15.512 --> 18:17.012
I'm not going.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.097
I wasn't asking.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.683
- [shrieking tone]
- [shouting]

18:21.684 --> 18:24.061
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, my God!

18:24.062 --> 18:26.230
- What the hell?
- This makes me feel...

18:26.231 --> 18:27.689
very uncomfortable.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.567
[shouting]

18:34.447 --> 18:36.741
What are you-- Stop it!

18:38.159 --> 18:40.537
[all snarling]

18:42.413 --> 18:43.956
What the actual fuck?

18:43.957 --> 18:45.332
Stand down.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.543
All of you.
I said this doesn't concern you.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.962
The hell it doesn't.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.965
[growling]

18:56.803 --> 18:59.721
[Mark whimpering]

18:59.722 --> 19:02.724
All of you, sit the fuck down.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.810
Now.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.771
Grab him. We're leaving.

19:08.773 --> 19:10.107
Fuck this.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.651
[grunts]

19:13.945 --> 19:16.197
[grunting]

19:25.331 --> 19:27.375
[shouting]

19:32.964 --> 19:34.424
[screams]

19:35.800 --> 19:37.718
[gurgling]

19:37.719 --> 19:39.888
[grunts]

19:42.307 --> 19:44.017
Stop!

19:46.686 --> 19:49.105
[shouting]

19:51.816 --> 19:54.152
Huh?

20:00.033 --> 20:02.075
[Robot] <i>Rex, no.</i>

20:02.076 --> 20:04.078
[grunts]

20:05.830 --> 20:07.331
Goddamn it, Rex!

20:07.332 --> 20:09.791
- [shrieking intensifies]
- [groaning]

20:09.792 --> 20:11.668
Why didn't that work?

20:11.669 --> 20:13.128
[Robot] <i>It had a dead man's switch.</i>

20:13.129 --> 20:15.464
<i>With the control destroyed,
it can't be turned off.</i>

20:15.465 --> 20:17.549
<i>I'm attempting to block the frequency.</i>

20:17.550 --> 20:18.927
[groaning, screaming]

20:22.764 --> 20:24.349
[grunting]

20:34.567 --> 20:35.734
Shut 'em down.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.653
Yes, the Reanimen!

20:37.654 --> 20:38.821
All of them. Now!

20:43.368 --> 20:45.370
[groaning]

20:46.371 --> 20:48.915
- [shrieking stops]
- [Robot] <i>Frequency blocked.</i>

20:49.499 --> 20:51.250
[shouting]

20:58.466 --> 20:59.634
[grunting]

21:00.802 --> 21:02.511
[shouting]

21:02.512 --> 21:03.680
- Huh?
- Huh?

21:21.572 --> 21:23.490
You arrogant

21:23.491 --> 21:25.785
little asshole.

21:26.911 --> 21:29.037
Look at this goddamn mess.

21:29.038 --> 21:31.206
Everywhere you go, destruction follows

21:31.207 --> 21:33.000
because of your ego.

21:33.001 --> 21:36.670
You're a hypocrite, waltzing off
to help your mass-murdering dad.

21:36.671 --> 21:38.797
But God forbid anyone else screws up

21:38.798 --> 21:41.217
and then tries to make good.

21:43.845 --> 21:45.637
Don't you ever...

21:45.638 --> 21:48.182
ever threaten me again.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.518
As for the rest of you...

21:51.519 --> 21:53.813
[both grunting]

21:56.941 --> 22:00.193
I will never work for you again.

22:00.194 --> 22:03.488
We are done. And if you ever come near

22:03.489 --> 22:04.990
- my family again...
- [groaning]

22:04.991 --> 22:07.910
...I will kill you.

22:11.664 --> 22:14.792
[groaning, gasping]

22:16.085 --> 22:19.087
- [Cecil coughing]
- Rudy.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.214
Get this fucking thing out of my head.

22:21.215 --> 22:22.841
Now.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.718
[Robot] <i>Yes.</i>

22:24.719 --> 22:26.345
<i>Of course.</i>

22:36.731 --> 22:38.524
[Rex] Oh, fuck.

22:39.525 --> 22:41.443
- [insets chirping]
- [dog barks in distance]

22:41.444 --> 22:44.029
He promised me he'd protect you.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.573
After everything that happened with Nolan,

22:46.574 --> 22:49.535
he looked me in the eye and he promised.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.704
It's not your fault, Mom.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.875
We all trusted Cecil
more than we should have.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.253
These always do the trick for me.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.714
Thanks.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.883
We fight monsters every day,

23:04.884 --> 23:07.511
but I didn't think
Cecil was one of them, too.

23:07.512 --> 23:08.720
[Debbie] He's lost it.

23:08.721 --> 23:11.932
If he went this far,
who knows what he'll do next?

23:11.933 --> 23:15.268
I can fight him. I'd kick his ass.

23:15.269 --> 23:18.021
I told Cecil if he goes near you or Oliver

23:18.022 --> 23:19.898
or...

23:19.899 --> 23:22.526
anyone else I care about,

23:22.527 --> 23:24.695
I'd kill him.

23:25.863 --> 23:28.323
[sighs]

23:28.324 --> 23:30.159
Oh, Mark.

23:31.369 --> 23:34.204
But why didn't you kill him already?
Then you wouldn't have to worry.

23:34.205 --> 23:36.540
- Oliver!
- We don't kill.

23:36.541 --> 23:38.667
But you just said you'd kill Cecil if he--

23:38.668 --> 23:40.628
I had to make sure he took me seriously.

23:41.796 --> 23:43.004
That's all.

23:43.005 --> 23:44.840
We don't kill people.

23:44.841 --> 23:47.759
Not in this family. Never.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.387
Okay, okay.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.514
But you need help now, right?

23:52.515 --> 23:55.100
I mean, you don't have
all those GDA guys

23:55.101 --> 23:56.434
if you get in trouble.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.687
Now I have powers and everything.

23:58.688 --> 24:01.565
I can come help you instead.
Mom said you'd train me!

24:01.566 --> 24:04.443
[Debbie] Training and helping
are two different things.

24:05.528 --> 24:07.279
[sighs]

24:07.280 --> 24:10.949
Mark didn't get his powers
until he was 17.

24:10.950 --> 24:13.618
He got to be a normal kid first.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.954
You deserve that, too.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.205
And get down from there.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.417
[somber music playing]

24:20.710 --> 24:22.627
Don't be in a rush, Oliver.

24:22.628 --> 24:24.130
Trust me.

24:29.594 --> 24:32.429
[sighs] It doesn't even make sense.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.598
I've known Cecil since I was 14.

24:34.599 --> 24:37.727
The first GDA guy who wasn't a total dick.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.770
Or so I thought.

24:40.771 --> 24:42.857
Why the hell would he do this?

24:43.900 --> 24:45.317
He's scared of me.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.652
Of what I could become, I guess.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.821
That's such bullshit.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.031
I know you.

24:51.032 --> 24:53.909
You don't hurt people if you can help it.

24:53.910 --> 24:57.120
I mean, Rex has been
asking for it for years,

24:57.121 --> 24:59.581
and you still haven't
thrown him into space.

24:59.582 --> 25:03.169
[chuckles] That's me, Mr. Self-Control.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.964
Cecil was right about Angstrom, though.

25:08.049 --> 25:11.718
I didn't mean to kill him, but... I did.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.262
Cecil was trying to get under your skin.

25:14.263 --> 25:16.389
You are better off without him.

25:16.390 --> 25:18.059
Thanks.

25:20.478 --> 25:23.104
I know things are weird between us
right now,

25:23.105 --> 25:26.192
but it means everything that you're here.

25:27.735 --> 25:30.028
Nah, I-I just thought
Debbie might need my help

25:30.029 --> 25:33.199
if things went bad with Cecil,
especially now that she has your brother.

25:35.201 --> 25:36.534
And...

25:36.535 --> 25:38.120
I was worried about you.

25:39.580 --> 25:41.498
Oh.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.500
What we were talking about earlier,

25:43.501 --> 25:46.212
before Doc Seismic...

25:47.255 --> 25:49.130
What I said, I...

25:49.131 --> 25:50.548
It came out all wrong.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.634
Oh, God. We don't have to
talk about that right now.

25:52.635 --> 25:54.094
If you really think I'd ask you out

25:54.095 --> 25:56.805
just because some future version
of you told me to, I--

25:56.806 --> 25:59.724
No, it's not just that. It... [sighs]

25:59.725 --> 26:01.643
It was humiliating.

26:01.644 --> 26:05.105
She was from
how many years in the future-- 20?

26:05.106 --> 26:07.941
So, the future me is almost 40 years old

26:07.942 --> 26:10.860
and she's still heartbroken
over something that never happened

26:10.861 --> 26:12.404
two decades earlier.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.239
That's who I end up becoming?

26:14.240 --> 26:16.574
She was a different version of you.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.660
Who knows what went on in her life?

26:18.661 --> 26:20.705
Still doesn't feel great.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.917
Eve, when I met you,

26:25.918 --> 26:27.961
I thought you were amazing.

26:27.962 --> 26:30.214
Like, right away. [chuckles]

26:31.215 --> 26:33.133
But you were with Rex,

26:33.134 --> 26:35.969
so I pushed those feelings down.

26:35.970 --> 26:38.471
Then I started dating Amber
and it was great,

26:38.472 --> 26:40.849
and I fell in love with her, but...

26:40.850 --> 26:43.226
what I felt for you...

26:43.227 --> 26:45.479
never totally went away.

26:46.772 --> 26:49.566
[Eve] A high school crush
isn't enough, Mark.

26:49.567 --> 26:51.484
That's not fair.

26:51.485 --> 26:52.986
You know it's more than that.

26:52.987 --> 26:55.906
I don't know. That's the problem.

26:58.242 --> 27:01.745
Uh, I need to think about this.
We both do.

27:01.746 --> 27:04.206
I'll always have your back, Mark.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.835
And maybe that has to be enough for now.

27:18.262 --> 27:20.805
Shouldn't there be
a clean-up crew for this?

27:20.806 --> 27:23.391
They're not here. We are.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.478
- Grab a mop.
- [Bulletproof scoffs]

27:27.521 --> 27:29.315
[sighs]

27:31.192 --> 27:33.319
[Rae] It's just like
back at the missile base.

27:35.404 --> 27:37.656
You don't have to do this, you know.

27:38.741 --> 27:41.368
Cecil spent millions
to put me back together.

27:41.369 --> 27:44.496
Then his dead monsters
tried to rip us apart.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.456
What even are we to him?

27:46.457 --> 27:47.749
[Monster Girl] We're weapons.

27:47.750 --> 27:50.710
Like his tanks and guns
and all that stuff.

27:50.711 --> 27:54.047
Useful until we're not.

27:54.048 --> 27:56.007
No kidding.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.717
Cry me a river.

27:57.718 --> 27:59.803
You'll feel better after some honest work.

27:59.804 --> 28:02.472
Hang on, man. You weren't even here.

28:02.473 --> 28:05.058
Cecil almost killed Mark.

28:05.059 --> 28:08.853
Sure. Sounds like Cecil went too far.

28:08.854 --> 28:11.022
But Invincible made him do it
when he broke into the Pentagon

28:11.023 --> 28:13.525
and started tearing shit up.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.902
The kid needs to learn what happens
when you don't think things through.

28:15.903 --> 28:18.113
When exactly was he supposed
to think it through?

28:18.114 --> 28:21.199
When Cecil was frying his brain
or when the Franken-bots were killing him?

28:21.200 --> 28:24.702
Mark faced consequences for once. Good.

28:24.703 --> 28:29.082
Cecil's always gone soft on him,
just like his father.

28:29.083 --> 28:31.793
Mark's dad almost killed him, you dick.

28:31.794 --> 28:35.213
All he had to do was follow orders,
like we all do.

28:35.214 --> 28:39.134
But I've seen most of you
not follow orders.

28:39.135 --> 28:41.386
Many times, in fact.

28:41.387 --> 28:44.848
[groans]
We should've never quit Teen Team.

28:44.849 --> 28:48.560
Do you even remember
how badly you wanted to be a Guardian?

28:48.561 --> 28:51.020
How hard we all worked to be here?

28:51.021 --> 28:54.023
- I died for this.
- [Rae] And you'll die again.

28:54.024 --> 28:57.861
And again and again,
and Cecil will never even care.

28:57.862 --> 29:00.989
Don't lecture me, Rae.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.992
I went through just as much
as you and Rex.

29:03.993 --> 29:06.035
- More, even.
- No, you didn't.

29:06.036 --> 29:07.662
Not anywhere close.

29:07.663 --> 29:09.038
There's only one of me.

29:09.039 --> 29:13.209
I can't go hide a backup copy
of myself away like you can.

29:13.210 --> 29:17.213
[scoffs]
Yeah, my powers are different. So?

29:17.214 --> 29:20.592
I also didn't fall apart
the minute I got hurt.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.760
- That's too far, Kate.
- How dare you?

29:22.761 --> 29:26.097
Just stop acting like
you're the only one who almost died.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.224
I had just as close a call as you did.

29:28.225 --> 29:30.852
This isn't about you, Kate.
It's about Cecil.

29:30.853 --> 29:33.104
Cecil only does what's necessary.

29:33.105 --> 29:36.274
So, I suppose it was necessary
to put a bomb in Mark's head?

29:36.275 --> 29:37.901
He just proved it was.

29:37.902 --> 29:39.986
Now get back to work.

29:39.987 --> 29:42.280
- That's an order.
- No!

29:42.281 --> 29:45.074
This is bullshit and we don't
have to put up with it anymore.

29:45.075 --> 29:47.160
Cecil doesn't own us.

29:47.161 --> 29:49.955
We can just leave.

29:51.040 --> 29:52.457
Where would we go?

29:52.458 --> 29:54.709
- What was wrong with Teen Team?
- Everything.

29:54.710 --> 29:57.629
- [Rex] At least we didn't try
and assassinate each other.
- [inhales deeply]

29:57.630 --> 30:00.006
- [groans]
- [Rudy] But I don't believe
that's exactly what happened.

30:00.007 --> 30:02.091
Oh, for the love of God!

30:02.092 --> 30:05.887
The Guardians
are the best superheroes in the world!

30:05.888 --> 30:08.848
It's a privilege and an honor
to work here!

30:08.849 --> 30:12.644
Yes, there's hardship!
Yes, there's sacrifice!

30:12.645 --> 30:16.148
If you children don't like that, get out!

30:17.149 --> 30:20.568
Ooh, that's a great idea,
because I'd rather quit

30:20.569 --> 30:22.779
than work one more day

30:22.780 --> 30:25.156
with a sanctimonious, bootlicking,

30:25.157 --> 30:28.076
hypocritical prick like you!

30:28.077 --> 30:30.328
[tense music playing]

30:30.329 --> 30:32.540
The door is over there.

30:34.458 --> 30:36.084
You heard him.

30:36.085 --> 30:38.127
Who's coming?

30:38.128 --> 30:40.088
You know I am.

30:40.089 --> 30:41.589
- Me too.
- [Black Samson] Wait!

30:41.590 --> 30:43.716
Everybody calm down.

30:43.717 --> 30:45.552
[Monster Girl] If Cecil did that to Mark,

30:45.553 --> 30:48.012
who's to say that
he wouldn't do that to all of us?

30:48.013 --> 30:49.806
That's a little extreme.

30:49.807 --> 30:52.475
- Fuck it. I'm out, too.
- [gasps]

30:52.476 --> 30:55.020
I can't work for a man I don't trust.

30:56.605 --> 30:58.357
I'm staying.

30:59.608 --> 31:01.193
[Rudy sighs]

31:04.280 --> 31:06.322
[sighs heavily]

31:06.323 --> 31:08.534
I'm sorry, Immortal.

31:14.164 --> 31:16.917
Shapesmith? Samson?

31:19.503 --> 31:22.547
Cecil let me live
after what I did on Mars,

31:22.548 --> 31:24.924
and m-my bed is a race car,

31:24.925 --> 31:28.177
so, I think Cecil.

31:28.178 --> 31:30.513
[quietly] I'm gonna go with Cecil.

31:30.514 --> 31:36.019
What Cecil did was messed-up,
but I can't fix that from the outside.

31:36.020 --> 31:39.857
[sighs] You have two hours to leave
before I throw you out myself.

31:42.401 --> 31:44.193
Immortal.

31:44.194 --> 31:46.404
Are you sure
you want to leave it like that?

31:46.405 --> 31:48.073
They'll be back.

31:51.201 --> 31:52.911
I don't think so.

31:54.079 --> 31:56.999
[birdsong]

32:00.544 --> 32:03.464
Sinclair's not in prison?

32:04.465 --> 32:06.215
I just assumed...

32:06.216 --> 32:07.800
[Mark] He should be.

32:07.801 --> 32:09.886
But Cecil gave him a job instead.

32:09.887 --> 32:12.514
That is the most messed-up thing
I've ever heard.

32:13.724 --> 32:17.102
So he just does whatever he wants?

32:18.854 --> 32:21.815
Makes more of those things?

32:26.236 --> 32:30.199
Yeah, I thought we stopped him,
but they just gave him a bigger lab.

32:31.867 --> 32:33.493
Uh, maybe I shouldn't have brought it up,

32:33.494 --> 32:36.288
but I thought you deserved to know.

32:37.373 --> 32:41.502
No. It's... it's better to know.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.715
Should I have done more to stop Sinclair?

32:48.926 --> 32:50.385
[somber music playing]

32:50.386 --> 32:52.179
This isn't your fault.

32:53.263 --> 32:54.597
I could have stopped him forever.

32:54.598 --> 32:56.474
Mark.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.142
He killed a dozen people.

32:58.143 --> 33:00.395
Hurt way more, you two included.

33:00.396 --> 33:01.896
He would have deserved it.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.232
I've known you
since we were five years old

33:04.233 --> 33:06.777
and that's-- it's just not who you are.

33:08.153 --> 33:10.154
You couldn't have known what would happen.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.448
I should have.

33:12.449 --> 33:13.908
[Rick] If you killed him,

33:13.909 --> 33:16.077
you'd be just like him.

33:16.078 --> 33:17.246
[sighs]

33:18.622 --> 33:20.874
The world doesn't
need more people like that.

33:21.875 --> 33:24.920
It needs more people like Invincible.

33:44.898 --> 33:46.692
What was that for?

33:47.860 --> 33:49.777
When I tried out for the Guardians,

33:49.778 --> 33:51.904
I didn't really think I'd get in.

33:51.905 --> 33:53.948
For the first few weeks I was here,

33:53.949 --> 33:56.326
it didn't feel real.

33:58.287 --> 34:00.121
I guess I was mostly right.

34:00.122 --> 34:03.459
The only real part was the people.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.294
I don't understand.

34:06.295 --> 34:08.796
I'm trying to say

34:08.797 --> 34:11.842
I'm glad you're coming with us.

34:12.926 --> 34:14.302
Oh.

34:14.303 --> 34:16.345
It-it just made logical sense,

34:16.346 --> 34:19.183
given the reality of the situation.

34:24.688 --> 34:27.316
Just tell the girl you're leaving for her.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.943
Good advice. I'll consider it.

34:30.944 --> 34:33.613
But... as much as you like her,

34:33.614 --> 34:35.282
there's something else.

34:36.825 --> 34:39.035
[Rudy] I don't know what you mean.

34:39.036 --> 34:40.913
Sure you do.

34:43.332 --> 34:45.333
Invincible is the most powerful superhero

34:45.334 --> 34:47.251
- on the planet.
- Hey, now.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.504
It's a simple fact. And someday,

34:49.505 --> 34:52.090
I might need him on my side.

34:53.175 --> 34:55.385
You always were a cold fish, man.

34:56.470 --> 34:58.013
But I'll miss you.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.852
I know, it doesn't
compare to Italy, right?

35:04.853 --> 35:07.730
But this place does make their own pasta.

35:07.731 --> 35:10.525
It's delicious. Really.

35:10.526 --> 35:12.902
I actually wasn't sure
this would ever happen.

35:12.903 --> 35:14.195
When you never called me back,

35:14.196 --> 35:16.781
I figured maybe you weren't interested...

35:16.782 --> 35:19.325
Paul, that's not it.

35:19.326 --> 35:21.537
Uh, after the gas explosion...

35:22.704 --> 35:25.748
It's embarrassing,
but I was scared to go out for a while.

35:25.749 --> 35:28.000
I'd be scared to stay in.

35:28.001 --> 35:29.253
Oh.

35:34.591 --> 35:37.885
Um, so, uh, how is Mark doing?

35:37.886 --> 35:39.428
He's what, 18?

35:39.429 --> 35:40.930
Nineteen.

35:40.931 --> 35:43.558
God, the time flies by.

35:43.559 --> 35:45.434
He's at Upstate U., right?

35:45.435 --> 35:49.146
Actually, he's, uh,
trying some other things.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.107
Oh.

35:51.108 --> 35:52.567
Mmm.

35:52.568 --> 35:54.360
Well, he's young.

35:54.361 --> 35:57.071
He's got lots of time
to figure things out.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.198
It's just been a rough few months.

35:59.199 --> 36:01.826
I get it. Ugh.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.244
My sister's kid

36:03.245 --> 36:04.996
seems like he gets
a ride home from the cops

36:04.997 --> 36:06.163
more often than not.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.582
Oh, oh, no,

36:07.583 --> 36:09.041
it's not like that.

36:09.042 --> 36:10.751
He and Oliver are good kids.

36:10.752 --> 36:13.129
They just have their...

36:13.130 --> 36:14.631
challenges.

36:15.716 --> 36:18.301
Are they special needs?
You never mentioned.

36:18.302 --> 36:20.803
Yes. Well, no.

36:20.804 --> 36:24.141
Uh, not in the conventional sense,
but they're, um...

36:26.226 --> 36:27.727
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

36:27.728 --> 36:29.228
I am screwing this up.

36:29.229 --> 36:32.899
Can you tell I haven't
been out on a date in 20 years?

36:32.900 --> 36:35.902
If it's all too soon...

36:35.903 --> 36:37.904
No, of course not.

36:37.905 --> 36:39.280
Or...

36:39.281 --> 36:41.700
God, maybe it is. I don't know.

36:43.035 --> 36:44.703
It's okay.

36:47.456 --> 36:48.789
[professor] <i>Welcome.</i>

36:48.790 --> 36:51.459
This is Introduction
to Architectural Form.

36:51.460 --> 36:53.711
If that's not what you're here for,

36:53.712 --> 36:55.671
you're in the wrong room.

36:55.672 --> 36:57.340
Here, you will learn

36:57.341 --> 36:59.592
the fundamentals of construction.

36:59.593 --> 37:01.802
How we make the houses we live in,

37:01.803 --> 37:03.721
the walls we use to protect ourselves,

37:03.722 --> 37:06.141
the roofs over our head.

37:09.311 --> 37:11.229
It's not as easy as it looks.

37:14.024 --> 37:15.442
Now, let's get started.

37:16.485 --> 37:17.736
[Cecil sighs]

37:18.737 --> 37:20.364
So this is it, then.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.450
It's better this way.

37:24.534 --> 37:27.370
We have the Reanimen
on standby if you need backup,

37:27.371 --> 37:29.956
and you can hold
try-outs for new members soon.

37:29.957 --> 37:31.917
But I also have another suggestion.

37:35.629 --> 37:38.464
Invincible wasn't willing
to give him another chance.

37:38.465 --> 37:42.218
I'm hoping that you'll
be more open-minded.

37:42.219 --> 37:44.638
I made mistakes, I won't lie.

37:46.056 --> 37:48.933
But I'm trying to make up for them.

37:48.934 --> 37:52.269
If you'll have me,
I'd be honored to serve.

37:52.270 --> 37:54.356
[pensive music playing]

37:58.485 --> 38:01.613
It will be good to have Darkwing
on the Guardians again.

38:14.001 --> 38:15.585
[door opens]

38:23.176 --> 38:25.720
Everything all right, sir?

38:25.721 --> 38:28.139
We'll soldier on.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.725
We always do.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.687
And Darkwing?

38:34.688 --> 38:36.356
What about him?

38:39.943 --> 38:43.070
I'm tired, Donald. Just spit it out.

38:43.071 --> 38:46.323
He did murder people in Midnight City.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.869
It was one thing calling him in
when we had no other choice.

38:49.911 --> 38:52.581
It's another putting him on the Guardians.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.417
People change, Donald.

38:56.668 --> 38:59.670
Bad guys reform, good guys
forget what they're fighting for.

38:59.671 --> 39:01.465
It's just...

39:02.758 --> 39:04.717
It's just how it works.

39:04.718 --> 39:07.511
[contemplative music playing]

39:07.512 --> 39:08.805
Hmm.

39:19.649 --> 39:20.776
[neck cracks]

39:22.778 --> 39:24.321
[sighs]

39:26.615 --> 39:28.617
[indistinct chatter]

39:31.411 --> 39:33.413
[door opens]

39:40.879 --> 39:42.838
[Donald] Director Stedman?

39:42.839 --> 39:44.548
Welcome to the GDA.

39:44.549 --> 39:47.259
My name is Donald Ferguson.
I'll be your number one.

39:47.260 --> 39:49.470
May I introduce you to the team?

39:49.471 --> 39:51.722
Knock yourself out.

39:51.723 --> 39:53.307
Good morning, everyone.

39:53.308 --> 39:55.684
This is Director Stedman. As you all know,

39:55.685 --> 39:58.395
he was handpicked by Director Radcliffe,

39:58.396 --> 40:00.856
and I trust you'll show him
the same energy

40:00.857 --> 40:02.691
and respect.

40:02.692 --> 40:05.445
I'm looking forward to working with you.

40:06.613 --> 40:08.031
[indistinct whispering]

40:09.116 --> 40:11.283
Wording's all the same.

40:11.284 --> 40:13.244
They're using old reports, Donald.

40:13.245 --> 40:16.497
Swapping in a few new sentences,
taking the easy way.

40:16.498 --> 40:18.582
They think because I was in prison
I'm a fuck-up,

40:18.583 --> 40:21.336
and that means they can
get away with shit like this.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.131
Uh, they don't know you yet.

40:25.132 --> 40:27.466
Yeah, well, if this doesn't change soon,
they're gonna learn

40:27.467 --> 40:29.135
- pretty quickly who I really am.
- [knocking]

40:29.136 --> 40:31.679
- [door opens]
- [woman] Excuse me, sirs?

40:31.680 --> 40:33.557
There's a situation.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.183
[Nolan grunting]

40:36.184 --> 40:37.768
No match on our system, sir.

40:37.769 --> 40:40.104
We don't know who this is or...

40:40.105 --> 40:42.064
if they're friendly or not.

40:42.065 --> 40:44.567
[Nolan grunts]

40:44.568 --> 40:46.652
Jesus, we better hope he is.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.362
Prep a chopper.

40:48.363 --> 40:49.363
Sir?

40:49.364 --> 40:51.365
Someone this powerful,

40:51.366 --> 40:54.326
protocol says we send in
the Immortal first.

40:54.327 --> 40:55.786
Ask questions later.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.454
We don't know his intentions yet, Donald,

40:57.455 --> 41:00.457
and the Immortal
tends to communicate with his fists.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.585
And, sir, what if he's hostile?

41:02.586 --> 41:04.461
Then Christmas comes early

41:04.462 --> 41:07.174
and you all get that new director
you wanted.

41:14.848 --> 41:17.309
[roars]

41:22.647 --> 41:24.191
[Nolan shouts]

41:36.578 --> 41:38.245
Who are you?

41:38.246 --> 41:41.583
Cecil Stedman, director
of the Global Defense Agency.

41:42.667 --> 41:45.294
We run teams of superheroes
to protect our planet from

41:45.295 --> 41:47.171
whatever dangers might arise.

41:47.172 --> 41:49.632
You don't look like
you're from around here.

41:49.633 --> 41:51.926
I'm from the planet Viltrum.

41:51.927 --> 41:53.552
My government sent me here

41:53.553 --> 41:56.096
to help protect the people of your world.

41:56.097 --> 41:59.100
Huh. They did, did they?

42:01.311 --> 42:02.812
What's your name?

42:05.065 --> 42:07.691
[Donald] Pupils dilated.
Heart rate elevated.

42:07.692 --> 42:09.777
He's an alien, so we don't know his norms,

42:09.778 --> 42:11.070
but if he were a human,

42:11.071 --> 42:12.571
he'd be lying.

42:12.572 --> 42:14.198
Yeah, no shit.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.575
All that crap he said about
the World Betterment Committee?

42:16.576 --> 42:18.494
Talk about a fairy tale.

42:18.495 --> 42:21.121
You don't get something
for nothing in this universe.

42:21.122 --> 42:22.831
What do we do, sir?

42:22.832 --> 42:26.669
Well, he says he wants to help,
so we'll let him help.

42:26.670 --> 42:28.671
- For now.
- Are you sure?

42:28.672 --> 42:30.839
You saw how strong he is.

42:30.840 --> 42:32.299
As long as he saves lives,

42:32.300 --> 42:34.218
I don't give a damn about his motivations.

42:34.219 --> 42:38.013
But track his movements, start a file,

42:38.014 --> 42:40.474
and get the eggheads
working on countermeasures.

42:40.475 --> 42:43.352
We'll figure out why he's really here.

42:43.353 --> 42:45.313
Right away, sir.

42:46.648 --> 42:48.275
[Donald] <i>Sir?</i>

42:49.693 --> 42:51.069
<i>Sir?</i>

42:52.570 --> 42:54.780
Sir, you were saying?

42:54.781 --> 42:58.200
Darkwing will be fine, Donald.
Just leave it be.

42:58.201 --> 43:00.495
And Invincible?

43:02.872 --> 43:04.291
[sighs]

43:06.376 --> 43:08.335
We can be the good guys

43:08.336 --> 43:10.755
or we can be the guys that save the world.

43:11.756 --> 43:13.799
We can't be both.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.885
[contemplative music playing]

43:33.320 --> 43:34.779
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:35.864 --> 43:37.281
Uh, can we talk?

43:37.282 --> 43:38.991
Uh, sure.

43:38.992 --> 43:40.702
Okay, um...

43:41.786 --> 43:43.245
I-I'm just gonna come out and say it.

43:43.246 --> 43:45.414
Uh...

43:45.415 --> 43:48.208
I know you think being friends
or having my back

43:48.209 --> 43:50.419
or whatever is enough for now,

43:50.420 --> 43:52.297
but it's not.

43:53.340 --> 43:54.466
Not for me.

43:55.550 --> 43:56.884
Mark...

43:56.885 --> 43:58.677
Just hear me out.

43:58.678 --> 44:00.597
When Cecil attacked me...

44:01.765 --> 44:04.308
I... I thought I was gonna die.

44:04.309 --> 44:06.185
Oh, my God. That's awful.

44:06.186 --> 44:09.271
That-that's not what I'm trying to say.

44:09.272 --> 44:10.564
Um...

44:10.565 --> 44:12.107
[exhales sharply]

44:12.108 --> 44:14.318
When I was lying on the ground

44:14.319 --> 44:17.321
with that sound drilling into my head...

44:17.322 --> 44:20.366
the only thing I could think about

44:20.367 --> 44:23.077
was you.

44:23.078 --> 44:24.661
[gentle music playing]

44:24.662 --> 44:26.413
About how if I died,

44:26.414 --> 44:29.917
I'd never get to see you again.

44:29.918 --> 44:31.795
That's how I know, Eve.

44:33.171 --> 44:37.007
That what I feel for you
isn't some stupid crush.

44:37.008 --> 44:38.510
It's real.

44:39.886 --> 44:41.930
It's always been real.

44:44.641 --> 44:46.184
Mm.

44:56.319 --> 44:58.070
I need you to be sure.

44:58.071 --> 45:00.697
I am. I-I mean it.

45:00.698 --> 45:03.284
I'm an idiot for not realizing it sooner.

45:04.327 --> 45:05.411
If you don't want to date me

45:05.412 --> 45:07.204
or you're not interested,

45:07.205 --> 45:10.125
I-I can't change that.

45:11.209 --> 45:13.252
But if you feel half as much for me

45:13.253 --> 45:16.506
as I do for you, then...

45:18.591 --> 45:20.260
...let's give it a try.

45:30.395 --> 45:32.354
Okay.

45:32.355 --> 45:33.939
Okay?

45:33.940 --> 45:35.650
Okay.

45:42.615 --> 45:44.658
So are we dating, or what?

45:44.659 --> 45:46.535
[short chuckle] Yes!

45:46.536 --> 45:49.455
I mean, if you want to.
I-I definitely want to.

- D-- I-- Uh... okay.
