[Manuel applauding]

02:13.872 --> 02:15.961
Please, come join me.

02:16.005 --> 02:16.832
Please, come.

02:20.879 --> 02:22.664
[Manuel speaking Spanish]

02:22.707 --> 02:23.491
Gracias.

02:30.019 --> 02:33.849
- Bravissima. I'm a big fan of
your voice.

02:33.892 --> 02:36.199
You have an exceptional talent.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.896
Thank you [chuckles].

02:37.940 --> 02:40.029
- Apologies. Where are my
manners?

02:40.072 --> 02:41.857
What can I get you to drink?

02:41.900 --> 02:44.033
Oh, I'm okay, thank you.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.166
- Please, after a performance
like that,

02:46.209 --> 02:49.473
you certainly earned one, for
sure.

02:49.517 --> 02:50.300
Yes?

02:51.693 --> 02:54.522
- Okay, I'll have a
glass of red wine please.

02:54.565 --> 02:57.699
- Akheem, bring me one bottle
of this new French red wine

02:57.742 --> 02:58.917
we just received yesterday.

02:58.961 --> 02:59.788
Yes, sir.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.880
You're from Chicago, right?

03:04.923 --> 03:07.056
You must be fan of cold winters
then?

03:07.099 --> 03:10.538
- Oh no, I hate the cold
actually.

03:10.581 --> 03:14.629
I'm from Florida, but I moved
away as soon as I could.

03:14.672 --> 03:16.108
To chase a dream.

03:16.152 --> 03:18.023
And cold winters just became a
price

03:18.067 --> 03:19.242
for that dream, I guess.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.071
It's paradise here.

03:22.114 --> 03:25.074
Rarely gets below 72 degrees.

03:27.555 --> 03:31.298
I'm offering you three times
whatever you make in Chicago

03:31.341 --> 03:34.823
to sing here in my club,
exclusively for me.

03:37.042 --> 03:39.567
- My God, that's an amazing
offer.

03:40.916 --> 03:43.135
[wine pouring]

03:43.179 --> 03:44.093
- I'm so sorry, ma'am. Let me
get that.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.660
- It's all right.
- I'm so sorry.

03:45.703 --> 03:47.183
It's not your fault.

03:47.227 --> 03:49.925
Akheem, it's okay, calm down.

03:49.968 --> 03:53.276
She's right. It certainly was an
accident.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.278
How long have you been
working for me, Akheem?

03:56.714 --> 03:58.194
Almost two months, sir.

03:58.238 --> 04:00.805
- Then you know the customer is
king.

04:00.849 --> 04:04.896
The customer deserve
excellent service, always.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.724
Yes, sir. I'm so sorry, sir.

04:06.768 --> 04:07.551
I'm sorry, ma'am.

04:07.595 --> 04:08.639
It's okay.

04:08.683 --> 04:09.466
I'm so so sorry.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.947
[blood flowing]

04:11.990 --> 04:13.557
You should be sorry.

04:13.601 --> 04:16.255
[blood flowing]

04:16.298 --> 04:18.910
[Akheem gasping]

04:18.954 --> 04:22.130
[soft dramatic music]

04:31.662 --> 04:32.489
Apologies.

04:34.317 --> 04:37.755
Why you don't go to get
cleaned up a little bit?

04:37.799 --> 04:40.367
Then come sing for me something
special.

04:40.410 --> 04:43.544
[soft dramatic music]

04:48.766 --> 04:51.726
You work for me now.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.858

05:18.056 --> 05:21.016
[soft dramatic music]

05:34.203 --> 05:36.858
- So, I finally had to
tell her last night.

05:36.901 --> 05:38.163
Bon voyage, Coco.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.429
You know, I know she was
wrong for me from the moment

05:42.472 --> 05:45.127
we met, but was she beautiful,
man.

05:45.170 --> 05:47.347
She had them long legs she
would just wrap around me.

05:47.390 --> 05:50.959
Crystal blue eyes, like
swimming pools of beauty.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.003
Just, mm [inhales].

05:54.789 --> 05:56.921
Hey, Mark, I'm over here just
pouring my heart out to you

05:56.965 --> 05:57.966
and I feel like you're not even
listening.

05:58.009 --> 05:59.010
Are you listening?

05:59.054 --> 05:59.881
No.

06:00.925 --> 06:03.101
Okay, all right. You're right.

06:03.145 --> 06:05.669
You were right, because I know,
from the moment you met her

06:05.713 --> 06:06.757
you were all like ...

06:06.801 --> 06:08.455
She wasn't right for you.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.065
And why is that, exactly?

06:11.849 --> 06:13.503
She was normal.

06:13.547 --> 06:14.112
Well, yeah.

06:15.505 --> 06:18.465
Well you know this is all
kinda your fault, right?

06:18.508 --> 06:19.030
My fault?

06:20.423 --> 06:22.251
Well yeah.

06:22.294 --> 06:24.645
We been working together
for years now, man.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.908
All you gotta do is come out
with me every once in a while,

06:26.951 --> 06:28.213
just have a couple drinks,
and maybe you could

06:28.257 --> 06:29.954
steer me clear of the wrong
girls.

06:29.998 --> 06:33.697
- I told you, I'm not into
that singles dating thing.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.786
- Singles dating scene, man,
that's all the dating scene is

06:35.830 --> 06:37.092
is a bunch of singles.

06:37.135 --> 06:39.224
Come on, man, you're the
only guy I know who's got

06:39.268 --> 06:41.052
his ex-wife's name tattooed on
his finger.

06:43.446 --> 06:47.450
- She wasn't my ex-wife
when I got the tattoo.

06:47.494 --> 06:50.148
- Yeah, I know that. Just
add a little something to it.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.237
What does that say anyway,
Attila?

06:52.281 --> 06:53.238
It's Akilah. Akilah.

06:54.979 --> 06:57.939
- Okay, so add a T and now it's
Tequila.

06:57.982 --> 06:59.244
Right? You'd be the cool guy at
the bar.

06:59.288 --> 07:00.637
You got Tequila on your knuckle.

07:00.681 --> 07:01.246
They're here.

07:02.726 --> 07:03.814
Get serious.

07:03.858 --> 07:07.252
[soft suspenseful music]

07:10.995 --> 07:12.214
Rock, paper, scissors? Hm?

07:14.956 --> 07:17.175
Okay. You always do rock anyway.

07:17.219 --> 07:20.091
[soft suspenseful music]

07:20.135 --> 07:20.962
S'up, Los.

07:22.093 --> 07:24.182
- Hello, my friend. How you
doing?

07:24.226 --> 07:25.619
- How the fuck you think I'm
doing, man?

07:25.662 --> 07:27.621
Waiting out here in West
Bumblefuck for your ass, man.

07:27.664 --> 07:28.752
What's up?

07:28.796 --> 07:29.797
- Let's not waste time. You got
the money?

07:29.840 --> 07:31.581
- Yo, I aint wasting the time,
man.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.367
All right, yeah, I got your
paper. You got my shit?

07:35.411 --> 07:36.238
Si.

07:37.195 --> 07:39.502
All right. What's up, Jose?

07:40.677 --> 07:42.592
Oh, you too hard for that shit,
right?

07:42.636 --> 07:45.073
[scoffs] This motherfucker.

07:45.116 --> 07:46.378
So what's up, man?

07:46.422 --> 07:48.076
We gonna transact, or
we gonna bullshit, what?

07:50.905 --> 07:51.688
Go check it out.

07:53.037 --> 07:54.952
- My brother's gonna get
the money from your car.

07:56.693 --> 07:59.522
- Hey, hey, hey. Yo, Rambo,
man, is that shit necessary?

07:59.566 --> 08:03.178
I'm afraid it is, amigo.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.136
- Hey, yo, what's up with
Senor Gun Show over here?

08:06.398 --> 08:08.183
- It's cool, man, just show him
the paper.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.143
Come on now, Handsome.

08:12.187 --> 08:13.928
Let me show you something real
pretty.

08:13.971 --> 08:16.408
[Jose speaking Spanish]

08:16.452 --> 08:18.062
- What's up, man? Where's my
shit?

08:20.456 --> 08:22.066
- Step into my office, my
friend.

08:23.154 --> 08:27.332
[soft suspenseful music]

08:27.376 --> 08:29.247
- About to make your day, man.
Come on.

08:30.553 --> 08:33.513
[soft suspenseful music]

08:33.556 --> 08:36.864
[Jose speaking Spanish]

08:39.301 --> 08:40.128
We happy?

08:41.172 --> 08:43.434
Yeah, that's your happy face.

08:43.479 --> 08:46.395
- Meat and potatoes, as
promised.

08:46.438 --> 08:50.225
[soft suspenseful music]

08:50.268 --> 08:52.053
Same quality as before?

08:52.096 --> 08:52.923
Even better.

08:54.490 --> 08:57.145
[plastic snapping]

08:59.451 --> 09:03.107
- Yeah. We're good, give him the
money.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.544
Great.

09:04.587 --> 09:07.242
Well, it's been a pleasure
doing business with you

09:07.285 --> 09:09.374
but don't take this the
wrong way when I say,

09:09.418 --> 09:11.028
I'm not gonna lose any
sleep if I never have to see

09:11.072 --> 09:12.769
your ugly fucking face ever
again.

09:14.641 --> 09:17.165
[Jose speaking Spanish]

09:17.208 --> 09:18.470
Well, that's not good.

09:18.514 --> 09:21.561
Yo, Phil. We good?

09:21.604 --> 09:22.431
Talk to me.

09:22.474 --> 09:23.954
Never better.

09:23.998 --> 09:26.740
Just think we got a little
lost in translation over here.

09:27.610 --> 09:30.178
- I'm gonna need you to pick up
that bag.

09:30.221 --> 09:34.182
Or I will end you right here,
right now.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.401
- Wait, so this whole time
you could speak English?

09:36.445 --> 09:37.577
Pick up that bag.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.186
All right.

09:39.404 --> 09:40.754
Slowly

09:40.797 --> 09:44.322
- Listen, man, okay,
it was real rude of me,

09:44.366 --> 09:46.455
and if I'm being honest with
myself,

09:46.498 --> 09:49.197
rather racist to assume
you don't speak English.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.720
[gun firing rapidly]

09:50.764 --> 09:53.549
- Hey, LAPD, motherfucker.
Drop it, drop it.

09:53.593 --> 09:54.419
Phil, talk to me.

09:55.551 --> 09:57.335
[blows striking]

09:57.379 --> 09:59.947
[both groaning]

09:59.990 --> 10:02.471
[dramatic music]

10:04.429 --> 10:06.344
He's a dead man. You both are.

10:06.388 --> 10:07.911
Shut the fuck up.

10:07.955 --> 10:08.738
Hey, Phil?

10:11.349 --> 10:12.350
[knee thudding]

10:12.394 --> 10:14.222
[both groaning]

10:14.265 --> 10:17.834
- Wait, wait! You're under
arrest, LAPD!

10:17.878 --> 10:18.922
[Phil groaning]

10:18.966 --> 10:20.315
Phil!

10:20.358 --> 10:21.838
- You might as well shoot,
because I promise you,

10:21.882 --> 10:24.580
my family will come after you
and everyone who loves you.

10:24.624 --> 10:25.625
Phil?

10:25.668 --> 10:26.930
- Till all of your lifeless
bodies

10:26.974 --> 10:28.279
are hanging from an overpass.

10:28.323 --> 10:30.499
- Hey, hey. Shut the fuck
up was not a request.

10:30.542 --> 10:33.154
Shut up. Phil!

10:33.197 --> 10:34.721
- You have the right to remain
silent.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.200
Anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

10:36.461 --> 10:37.506
[blows striking]

10:37.549 --> 10:38.899
[both groaning]

10:40.509 --> 10:42.119
[kick striking]

10:42.163 --> 10:43.555
You okay?

10:43.599 --> 10:46.036
[blows striking]

10:46.080 --> 10:47.385
[dramatic music]

10:47.429 --> 10:49.518
- If you can't afford an
attorney

10:49.561 --> 10:51.476
one will be appointed for you.

10:51.520 --> 10:54.218
[kick striking]

10:54.262 --> 10:56.743
Have you understood these rights
as I have read them to you?

10:56.786 --> 11:00.050
Hey, amigo. Buddy?

11:00.094 --> 11:01.443
Ah, shit.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.228
Hey, Mark, do you think
he heard that last part

11:04.272 --> 11:06.535
or am I gonna have to read
him his whole Miranda rights

11:06.578 --> 11:09.799
warning all over again,
because I don't wanna.

11:09.843 --> 11:11.105
- Well, judging by his rap
sheet,

11:11.148 --> 11:12.584
I think he's heard it before.

11:12.628 --> 11:15.326
You, uh, look clean.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.241
Your guy, he was a lot smaller.

11:18.547 --> 11:21.245
- True. Maybe you should cuff
him.

11:21.289 --> 11:22.377
I don't know if you
have the punching power

11:22.420 --> 11:24.553
to keep him out very long.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.468
- Oh, he's got jokes,
and white pants. Heh.

11:28.383 --> 11:29.906
Hey, it is not a good time.

11:30.690 --> 11:34.084
[soft mournful music]

12:12.209 --> 12:15.343
We are gathered here today

12:15.386 --> 12:17.301
to celebrate the life
of our brother Akheem.

12:20.565 --> 12:22.698
I have known Akheem's mother,
Yvonne,

12:22.742 --> 12:24.352
and his brother Mark for a long
time.

12:26.789 --> 12:29.009
I can remember the day Akheem
was born,

12:30.575 --> 12:34.492
bringing with him into this
world, and to this island,

12:34.536 --> 12:36.451
that infectious smile that all
of us

12:36.494 --> 12:38.453
would soon know and love.

12:39.584 --> 12:43.501
I ask all of you now to
remember fondly Akheem

12:43.545 --> 12:45.112
and his infectious smile.

12:46.635 --> 12:50.682
But also to let his
tragic death be a reminder

12:50.726 --> 12:53.511
that we must collectively
guard the lives of our youths.

12:55.687 --> 12:57.167
Because make no mistake about
it,

12:59.039 --> 13:02.607
whereas our island is
surely a gift from God,

13:02.651 --> 13:06.002
lest we forget the devil does
not strike at us from afar.

13:07.482 --> 13:11.703
No. He slithers along
the soil we call home.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.619
Waiting to coil around the feet

13:14.663 --> 13:16.665
of any who dare oppose him.

13:16.708 --> 13:20.103
[soft mournful music]

13:35.162 --> 13:38.034
Yvonne, I am so sorry.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.560
Thank you, Akilah.

13:42.604 --> 13:45.825
[soft piano music]

13:45.868 --> 13:49.045
Please, come see me soon.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.528
[Yvonne crying]

13:56.183 --> 13:58.663
- We never met. I'm Manuel
Alvarez.

13:58.707 --> 14:02.624
I'm terribly sorry. My deepest
condolence.

14:02.667 --> 14:06.584
[soft piano music]

14:06.628 --> 14:09.239
If there is anything I can do
for you, please let me know.

14:13.983 --> 14:16.203
I'm so sorry for your loss.

14:16.246 --> 14:19.119
[soft mournful music]

14:31.653 --> 14:33.568
[door closing]

14:33.611 --> 14:36.527
[soft mournful music]

14:38.703 --> 14:41.706
- I'm sorry, Son. I didn't get
a chance to clean the house.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.012
Mom, it's fine, it's fine.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.144
- But I'm glad you're home,
baby.

14:44.187 --> 14:45.623
Me too.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.974
- Let me get you something
to eat. You must be hungry.

14:48.017 --> 14:50.150
- No, Mom. Mom, Mom, please,
please stop.

14:50.193 --> 14:51.673
I just want you to relax.

14:51.716 --> 14:54.502
You don't need to be doing
anything right now. Come, sit.

14:54.545 --> 14:55.329
Come, sit.

14:56.504 --> 14:59.333
- I have some things from your
brother.

14:59.376 --> 15:00.247
Okay.

15:00.290 --> 15:02.423
[soft music]

15:23.966 --> 15:25.925
He was wearing that when ...

15:27.709 --> 15:29.450
I'd like you to have it.

15:29.493 --> 15:31.669
[soft music]

15:35.499 --> 15:36.631
Thanks, Mom.

15:36.674 --> 15:39.025
[soft music]

15:42.724 --> 15:43.725
Tell me what happened.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.641
I don't, I don't know.

15:46.684 --> 15:49.905
He got a job, and he was
staying out of trouble.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.863
Trouble?

15:51.907 --> 15:54.692
- A lot has changed over
the past seven years

15:54.736 --> 15:56.303
since you've been gone, Son.

15:56.346 --> 15:59.567
The island just isn't the same
anymore.

15:59.610 --> 16:00.829
- I'm gonna find out what
happened.

16:00.872 --> 16:04.789
- No, no, Mark. I just
lost one of my sons.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.704
I cannot lose another.

16:06.748 --> 16:09.142
Mom, listen to me, okay?

16:11.144 --> 16:14.799
Everything is gonna be
okay. Just trust me.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.018
Get some rest, okay?

16:17.628 --> 16:19.804
[Yvonne sobbing]

16:19.848 --> 16:22.764
[soft music]

16:22.807 --> 16:24.461
It's gonna be okay.

16:24.505 --> 16:27.638
[Yvonne crying]

16:27.682 --> 16:30.032
Hey, Mom, it's gonna be all
right.

16:30.076 --> 16:33.035
[Yvonne crying]

16:33.079 --> 16:34.558
Get some rest.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.865
Okay [cries].

16:36.908 --> 16:39.302
[soft music]

17:29.526 --> 17:32.007
[dramatic music]

17:52.593 --> 17:54.812
[gate squeaking]

17:54.856 --> 17:57.250
[soft music]

17:59.991 --> 18:01.515
- I swear to God, it's not our
stuff.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.907
I'm telling you, tell him.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.692
- Yo, somebody put that
in our car. I promise you.

18:04.735 --> 18:06.085
- We've been set up. We were set
up.

18:06.128 --> 18:07.825
A complete misunderstanding.

18:07.869 --> 18:09.784
It's a big misunderstanding,
okay?

18:09.827 --> 18:10.785
It's the truth, I swear.

18:12.743 --> 18:14.832
[knocking on door]

18:14.876 --> 18:16.791
[Nate chuckling]

18:16.834 --> 18:18.097
Yes, Brother.

18:20.577 --> 18:21.404
Long time.

18:21.448 --> 18:22.666
Yeah. Sit down, sit down.

18:28.498 --> 18:29.847
I'm really sorry about Akheem.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.416
He was a good kid.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.243
Thank you.

18:35.984 --> 18:37.159
So what have you found out?

18:41.946 --> 18:45.428
- We go way back, so I'm just
gonna give it to you straight.

18:45.472 --> 18:48.475
We don't have the same
manpower that you do in LA.

18:48.518 --> 18:49.737
I remember.

18:49.780 --> 18:50.607
So this,

18:53.175 --> 18:54.611
this is gonna take some time.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.573
And right now, we don't have
a whole lot to go off of.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.973
This is all you have?

19:10.888 --> 19:12.325
- That's everything from the
table.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.023
Maybe a fight with the gangs.

19:15.066 --> 19:15.893
Gangs?

19:18.069 --> 19:20.855
- Yeah, there's been a lotta
crime

19:20.898 --> 19:22.900
here on the island since you
been gone.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.772
Especially with gangs
from neighboring islands

19:24.815 --> 19:25.903
coming here to party.

19:25.947 --> 19:27.818
The drug traffic is way up.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.953
- So you think this is
gang-related?

19:34.912 --> 19:35.739
Like I say,

19:37.306 --> 19:39.656
this is gonna take some time to
find out

19:39.700 --> 19:42.093
what actually happened.

19:42.137 --> 19:45.401
But when I do, you'll
be the first to know.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.012
All right.

19:48.056 --> 19:51.190
[soft dramatic music]

19:53.931 --> 19:56.195
[hands smacking]

19:56.238 --> 19:59.372
[soft dramatic music]

20:07.641 --> 20:08.424
[students shouting]

20:08.468 --> 20:09.251
Nine.

20:09.295 --> 20:09.904
[students shouting]

20:09.947 --> 20:10.774
10!

20:11.210 --> 20:11.993
One!

20:12.036 --> 20:12.559
[students shouting]

20:12.602 --> 20:13.429
Two!

20:14.213 --> 20:15.039
Three!

20:15.736 --> 20:16.563
- Four!
[students shouting]

20:17.041 --> 20:17.738
- Five!
[students shouting]

20:18.042 --> 20:18.956
- Six!
[students shouting]

20:19.696 --> 20:20.871
- Seven!
[students shouting]

20:20.915 --> 20:22.046
- Eight!
[students shouting]

20:22.090 --> 20:23.222
- Nine!
[students shouting]

20:23.700 --> 20:24.658
10!

20:24.701 --> 20:25.572
[students shouting]

20:27.835 --> 20:28.662
And one!

20:28.705 --> 20:29.271
[students shouting]

20:29.315 --> 20:30.098
Two!

20:30.707 --> 20:31.273
- Three!
[students shouting]

20:31.882 --> 20:32.753
- Four!
[students shouting]

20:33.014 --> 20:34.537
Bye, Sensei Akilah.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.800
Bye, Sensei.

20:36.844 --> 20:37.801
See you guys next week.

20:42.197 --> 20:44.199
So, how's the big city treating
you?

20:45.287 --> 20:47.942
- Well, not a day goes
by that I don't think

20:47.985 --> 20:51.772
about the island, if
that's what you're asking.

20:52.947 --> 20:54.035
But you left.

20:54.992 --> 20:56.080
And you know why I left?

20:57.995 --> 20:58.822
Yeah.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.957
So, um ...

21:04.393 --> 21:06.743
Did you ever remarry?

21:07.309 --> 21:09.703
[soft music]

21:12.271 --> 21:13.097
No.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.100
You?

21:18.712 --> 21:19.539
No.

21:21.280 --> 21:24.021
[soft piano music]

21:24.065 --> 21:26.676
- Well I'm happy you kept
up with your training.

21:28.156 --> 21:30.289
How long have you had the dojo?

21:30.332 --> 21:32.378
- Ah, going on about three years
now.

21:32.421 --> 21:33.248
- Uh-huh.

21:35.903 --> 21:36.860
I'm impressed.

21:38.079 --> 21:40.386
The kids are lucky to have you.

21:40.429 --> 21:42.388
[soft piano music]

21:43.954 --> 21:45.086
You know, I um,

21:47.175 --> 21:49.133
I always hoped I'd see you
again,

21:51.484 --> 21:52.702
but not like this.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.837
I am so sorry about Akheem,
Mark.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.014
Thank you.

22:01.842 --> 22:03.104
How long are you staying for?

22:04.497 --> 22:06.934
- Long enough to find out
what happened to Akheem.

22:08.239 --> 22:10.459
I went to the police
station to talk to Nate.

22:11.373 --> 22:14.245
He says there are gangs
here on the island.

22:14.289 --> 22:16.378
Unfortunately, yeah.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.815
The gangs come over on the
weekends from other islands

22:18.859 --> 22:21.209
and bring with them more drugs
and crime.

22:21.252 --> 22:23.994
But I wouldn't hold on to too
much hope

22:24.038 --> 22:26.127
in whatever Nate says or does.

22:26.170 --> 22:27.084
Why is that?

22:29.086 --> 22:31.741
- Because people around here
are afraid to make waves.

22:32.742 --> 22:33.569
I'm listening.

22:35.571 --> 22:39.183
- This guy, Manuel
Alvarez, everyone calls him

22:39.227 --> 22:40.881
the Company because he owns
everything

22:40.924 --> 22:43.057
that's important on the island.

22:43.100 --> 22:47.017
He owns the bank, construction
companies, hotels.

22:48.367 --> 22:51.848
In less than four years, he
basically managed to control

22:51.892 --> 22:54.503
the entire economy of the
island.

22:54.547 --> 22:57.114
Not to mention the only
places that the gangs seem

22:57.158 --> 23:00.161
to avoid are the businesses he
owns.

23:00.204 --> 23:01.467
And I'm pretty sure he controls
them too,

23:01.510 --> 23:04.948
just to scare the people on the
island.

23:04.992 --> 23:07.298
So whether they like it
or not, a lot of people

23:07.342 --> 23:09.518
around here rely on him to
survive.

23:10.998 --> 23:12.521
Do you remember Vanessa?

23:13.957 --> 23:15.437
Yeah.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.613
- She's working at the bank
and told me in confidence

23:17.657 --> 23:20.050
that hundreds of millions
go through the bank now.

23:21.574 --> 23:23.967
- But what does that
have to do with Akheem?

23:26.317 --> 23:29.277
- Two months ago, Akheem took a
job

23:29.320 --> 23:32.149
as a bartender working for
Alvarez.

23:33.281 --> 23:34.108
What club?

23:35.109 --> 23:37.024
Luna. Club Luna.

23:39.940 --> 23:41.855
What are you going to do, Mark?

23:43.596 --> 23:45.206
- I'm gonna do whatever it
takes.

23:47.208 --> 23:50.124
Starting with a visit to this
Alvarez.

23:52.126 --> 23:53.083
Just be careful.

23:54.215 --> 23:56.173
[dramatic music]

24:05.444 --> 24:08.882
[engine humming]

24:08.925 --> 24:12.059
[soft dramatic music]

24:27.117 --> 24:28.467
Can I help you?

24:28.510 --> 24:30.599
Here to speak to your boss.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.906
- You're gonna have to
make an appointment.

24:32.949 --> 24:34.473
Not my style.

24:34.516 --> 24:37.040
- Your style? Perhaps you've not
heard--

24:37.084 --> 24:37.911
It's okay.

24:39.826 --> 24:40.609
Please.

24:42.002 --> 24:42.829
Come, sit down.

24:44.439 --> 24:45.005
No thank you.

24:47.268 --> 24:49.400
- Can I get you something to
drink?

24:49.444 --> 24:50.010
No.

24:52.012 --> 24:54.101
So, how can I help you?

24:56.103 --> 24:58.061
My brother worked for you?

24:58.105 --> 25:00.673
- He did. A lot of people work
for me.

25:02.065 --> 25:03.327
Mm. Here at this bar?

25:03.371 --> 25:06.417
- Yes. And he was a good
bartender.

25:06.461 --> 25:07.810
- So you're aware that
my brother was killed

25:07.854 --> 25:09.551
the night he was working here?

25:09.595 --> 25:12.249
You know, I don't think I like

25:12.293 --> 25:13.947
the implication you are making.

25:15.122 --> 25:16.863
- I look like I care what you
think?

25:18.473 --> 25:20.040
What the fuck happened to my
brother?

25:24.087 --> 25:25.785
You are upset, and I get it.

25:27.221 --> 25:28.527
And I'm here to help,

25:28.570 --> 25:30.659
but you're not going to find the
answer

25:30.703 --> 25:32.618
you're looking for here.

25:32.661 --> 25:36.404
Your brother left after
his shift at night,

25:36.447 --> 25:38.667
and it seems to me he
may have gotten himself

25:38.711 --> 25:41.061
into some troubles with the
gangs.

25:41.104 --> 25:45.021
[soft dramatic music]

25:45.065 --> 25:48.459
[pen scribbling]

25:48.503 --> 25:49.069
Here.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.159
What is this?

25:53.900 --> 25:56.163
A spot, a bar actually,

25:56.206 --> 25:58.208
where a lot of the gangs

25:58.252 --> 26:00.297
that come over from
other islands hang out.

26:01.472 --> 26:02.822
My people have told me that your
brother

26:02.865 --> 26:04.693
used to go there after work.

26:06.608 --> 26:09.872
This is not the same island
you grew up on. Not anymore.

26:11.308 --> 26:13.006
- You know, everybody
keeps telling me that.

26:14.442 --> 26:18.446
- Change is inevitable.
Good and bad, I'm afraid.

26:18.489 --> 26:21.144
- You're right about
that. Changes are coming.

26:22.537 --> 26:26.019
So you might wanna move your
business off of the island.

26:26.062 --> 26:26.628
Oh [chuckles].

26:28.587 --> 26:31.241
A threat by an LA police
officer?

26:32.460 --> 26:36.290
Yes, I have friends all over
America.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.902
I did my homework on you, Mark.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.253
Apparently not enough.

26:43.297 --> 26:44.951
Otherwise, you'd be packing
right now.

26:46.300 --> 26:49.477
I've done my homework
on you too, Mr. Alvarez.

26:51.174 --> 26:53.829
And I know your type. And I
promise you.

26:55.265 --> 26:56.876
The weather's about to
get very bad for you here.

26:56.919 --> 27:00.053
[soft dramatic music]

27:07.103 --> 27:08.365
[ice rattling]

27:08.409 --> 27:09.802
What do you want me to do?

27:13.719 --> 27:15.242
[Manuel sighing]

27:16.809 --> 27:20.247
- Get the gangs from
the north to handle him.

27:20.290 --> 27:23.206
[soft dramatic music]

27:26.688 --> 27:29.125
[engine humming]

27:32.389 --> 27:35.088
[food sizzling]

27:42.399 --> 27:43.226
Teseam?

27:44.445 --> 27:47.491
Mark. My brother.

27:47.535 --> 27:49.102
Welcome home and good to see
you.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.277
You hungry? Hey, let me hook you
up, man.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.539
Nah nah, nah nah.

27:51.582 --> 27:55.021
No thanks, man. I'm
here for something else.

27:56.936 --> 27:58.981
Man, I'm sorry about Akheem.

27:59.721 --> 28:01.244
I really wanted to go to the
funeral,

28:01.288 --> 28:03.812
but with six mouths to
feed now, I got to--

28:03.856 --> 28:06.336
- Wait. You and Dayana
got four more kids now?

28:06.380 --> 28:08.121
- Yeah, brother, we've been
blessed.

[lock unhooking]

44:18.133 --> 44:21.006
[soft dramatic music]

44:32.060 --> 44:33.671
- You tell me about what you
know,

44:33.714 --> 44:35.150
and I will get you off this
island.

44:37.675 --> 44:40.112
I can't. They will kill me.

44:42.375 --> 44:45.204
You have to go. If they
see me talking to you--

44:45.247 --> 44:48.860
- No no, Nora, Nora, Nora.
Please.

44:48.903 --> 44:51.384
Just, look, calm down.

44:53.299 --> 44:55.605
No one is here, and no
one is going to kill you.

44:56.737 --> 44:59.827
Now it is my job to protect
people in your situation

44:59.871 --> 45:03.091
and I swear I will get
you back to the U.S.

45:04.527 --> 45:07.530
When? When can you got me out?

45:07.574 --> 45:10.055
- If you tell me what
happened to my brother,

45:10.098 --> 45:13.841
I will get you out today, okay?

45:13.885 --> 45:16.626
I will have my partner
meet you at the airport

45:16.670 --> 45:20.195
back in the U.S., and he
will make sure you're safe.

45:20.239 --> 45:23.459
But, I need to know what
happened.

45:23.503 --> 45:26.419
[soft dramatic music]

45:29.465 --> 45:31.554
[Nora sighing]

45:34.644 --> 45:35.471
He killed him.

45:37.691 --> 45:38.953
Right in front of me.

45:40.346 --> 45:43.001
Because he spilled some wine on
me.

45:43.044 --> 45:43.653
Alvarez?

45:48.049 --> 45:48.702
Yes.

45:48.746 --> 45:52.140
[soft dramatic music]

45:54.273 --> 45:56.101
I see it every time I close my
eyes.

45:58.190 --> 45:59.234
I'm so sorry.

46:01.497 --> 46:04.849
I am so sorry [cries].

46:04.892 --> 46:08.026
[soft dramatic music]

46:09.636 --> 46:11.420
I just came here to sing
[cries].

46:16.295 --> 46:17.470
It's gonna be okay.

47:01.557 --> 47:02.428
Come on.

47:10.262 --> 47:12.307
Don't worry. You can trust him.

47:12.351 --> 47:13.613
Are you sure?

47:13.656 --> 47:16.616
- I promise you. He's
one of the good guys.

47:18.748 --> 47:21.403
Hey, I wanna thank you for
telling me

47:21.447 --> 47:23.318
about what happened to my
brother.

47:29.847 --> 47:30.848
So how we looking?

47:30.891 --> 47:31.674
We're good.

47:33.198 --> 47:35.504
- Are you sure it isn't better
for her to stick around?

47:35.548 --> 47:37.767
We could arrest him now, and
with her testimony we could--

47:37.811 --> 47:40.509
- There isn't gonna be any
trial.

47:43.643 --> 47:45.340
And I promised to get her off
the island.

47:47.560 --> 47:48.387
We better get going.

47:49.301 --> 47:50.563
Thank you.

47:50.606 --> 47:52.260
- No need to thank me
for doing what's right.

47:55.394 --> 47:56.786
You can come with me.

47:56.830 --> 47:58.005
It's all right.

47:59.267 --> 48:02.401
[soft suspenseful music]

48:13.586 --> 48:14.674
I've got news.

48:18.112 --> 48:22.377
There was an eyewitness.
Alvarez killed Akheem.

49:09.511 --> 49:11.992
- Everything has been taken care
of.

49:12.036 --> 49:13.472
This boat will take you to a
taxi

49:13.515 --> 49:15.387
that will get you to the
airport.

49:18.912 --> 49:20.479
You can trust him.

49:25.571 --> 49:26.224
Here's your ticket.

49:29.357 --> 49:30.706
Mark's partner, Phil,
will be waiting for you

49:30.750 --> 49:31.577
when you reach Miami.

49:33.840 --> 49:34.667
Thank you.

49:35.624 --> 49:36.451
One last thing.

49:38.976 --> 49:40.760
Leave the demons you're
carrying, the ones in your head,

49:40.803 --> 49:41.891
behind on this island.

49:43.981 --> 49:45.895
There's no reason for you
to carry them anymore.

50:43.127 --> 50:44.954

go.

50:45.564 --> 50:46.782
What's going on, Mark?

50:46.826 --> 50:48.480
Mom, you gotta trust me.

50:49.959 --> 50:50.699
Still know how to shoot one of
these?

50:50.743 --> 50:51.570
Absolutely.

50:51.613 --> 50:53.702
All right, good. Take Mom.

50:53.746 --> 50:55.356

Go, Nate.

Thank God you're all right.

54:42.409 --> 54:43.192
It's clear.

54:44.368 --> 54:45.847
They're gone for now.

54:45.891 --> 54:48.023
These guys were not amateurs.

54:48.067 --> 54:51.113
- Yeah, I know. You've awakened
the devil.

54:51.157 --> 54:52.550
You have a plan?

54:52.593 --> 54:55.901
- Yeah, first thing is to
get my mom somewhere safe.

54:55.944 --> 54:57.555
You have a place in mind?

54:57.598 --> 54:58.686
I do.

54:58.730 --> 54:59.513
Good.

55:01.036 --> 55:03.125
I'm going back to the station,
see what I can find out.

55:03.909 --> 55:06.259
- All right, meet you in a few
hours.

55:06.303 --> 55:07.260
Where?

55:07.304 --> 55:08.740
The old sugar mill.

[suspenseful music]

55:38.465 --> 55:40.032
So where is she?

55:40.075 --> 55:42.208
I thought you were keeping her
locked up.

55:50.521 --> 55:52.174
Kind of hard for her to stay
strung out

55:54.089 --> 55:55.830
if she's out of junk!

55:55.874 --> 55:57.223
She never told me she was out.

55:57.266 --> 55:59.791
Oh, she never told?

56:01.793 --> 56:02.881
I'm sorry.

56:02.924 --> 56:04.926
Okay, I know I messed up. I'm
sorry.

56:04.970 --> 56:07.189
It's okay. Forget about it.

56:08.365 --> 56:10.541
When was the last time you saw
her?

56:10.584 --> 56:14.414
- Yesterday, afternoon, when
I dropped off some dope.

56:14.458 --> 56:17.243
I gave it to her, I swear.

56:17.286 --> 56:19.201
- Did she use it, in front of
you?

56:20.420 --> 56:21.900
I, I don't remember.

56:21.943 --> 56:23.989
Oh, you don't remember?

56:25.207 --> 56:26.208
Don't remember.

56:28.341 --> 56:29.908
Do you have any on you now?

56:30.996 --> 56:32.476
What?

56:32.519 --> 56:35.000
- The drugs you give her?
Do you have some on you now?

56:35.043 --> 56:36.610
- Yeah, yeah, right here. Right
here.

56:37.524 --> 56:38.090

sorry.

Hold him down.

56:48.317 --> 56:50.842
No, please!

56:50.885 --> 56:51.712
Open his mouth.

56:52.931 --> 56:55.542
[clerk gasping]

56:56.717 --> 56:58.806
Swallow it!

57:01.853 --> 57:04.072
Swallow it, junkie puta!

57:12.341 --> 57:15.519
Now, that's how you keep someone
doped up.

Everything go as planned?

58:19.234 --> 58:22.629
- Yeah, she's safe and sound.
You get the email I sent?

58:22.673 --> 58:26.415
- Yeah, looking at it now.
Thanks for helping me with this.

58:26.459 --> 58:29.157
Our resources on the island are
tight.

58:29.201 --> 58:30.115
Yeah, happy to help.

58:32.204 --> 58:34.511
You know, the fingerprints
belong to a sicario,

58:34.554 --> 58:37.078
a member of a pretty
vicious Colombian cartel.

58:38.384 --> 58:39.690
What's going on down there, man?

58:39.733 --> 58:40.560
Give it to me straight.

58:40.604 --> 58:41.605
Mark aint telling me anything,

58:41.648 --> 58:44.346
and these are not small-town
players.

58:44.390 --> 58:45.217
I know.

58:46.305 --> 58:47.132
I got to go.

58:48.568 --> 58:49.787

Hey, guys, let's go. Come

59:41.882 --> 59:43.275
Welcome to my home.

59:47.192 --> 59:50.282
Hey, you kids be careful
around our guests, okay?

59:50.325 --> 59:52.676
- It's okay, the laughter of
children

59:52.719 --> 59:54.503
is the most beautiful thing in
the world.

59:55.766 --> 59:58.943
You know, I remember when
you two were the same age,

59:58.986 --> 01:00:00.205
nothing but trouble [laughs].

01:00:04.078 --> 01:00:05.471
Kids, get in here and eat.

01:00:07.038 --> 01:00:08.213
I'll help you with that.

01:00:08.517 --> 01:00:11.129

Hey, Dayana.

01:00:13.087 --> 01:00:14.480
- Hello, Mark. It's good to see
you.

01:00:14.523 --> 01:00:15.350
You too.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:18.702
Are you sure this is okay?

01:00:18.745 --> 01:00:20.268
Of course.

01:00:20.312 --> 01:00:21.400
Dayana and I wish that there
was more we could do to help.

01:00:21.443 --> 01:00:24.446
- Hey, taking care of my mother
and Akilah

01:00:24.490 --> 01:00:26.405
is more than enough, bro.

01:00:26.448 --> 01:00:28.625
- You mean taking care of your
mother.

01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:30.322
I'm not staying.

01:00:30.365 --> 01:00:31.497
Akilah, you need to stay here.

01:00:31.540 --> 01:00:35.109
- What I need is to be
there for my island.

01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:36.545
Akilah, please.

01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:38.069
And to be there for you too.

01:00:44.466 --> 01:00:47.121

back as soon as I can.

Stay safe, my friends.

01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:51.996
Don't worry about your mother.

01:00:52.039 --> 01:00:54.259
She gonna be safe here with us.

01:00:54.302 --> 01:00:56.130

01:01:28.206 --> 01:01:29.598
Forgive me, Father.

01:01:29.642 --> 01:01:33.298
I can't even remember the
last time I came to church.

01:01:34.865 --> 01:01:36.649
As one of God's children,

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.607
all that matters is that you are
here now.

01:01:41.393 --> 01:01:43.221
Go on. What is on your mind, my
son?

01:01:44.918 --> 01:01:46.354
- I need to ask you to
do something for me.

01:01:49.749 --> 01:01:51.359
Please keep it safe.

01:01:51.403 --> 01:01:53.187
- I don't understand. What is
it?

01:01:54.536 --> 01:01:56.408
If anything happens to me,

01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:58.018
open it and I'll trust
you'll know what to do.

01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:01.413
[soft music]

01:02:06.157 --> 01:02:09.116
[singer vocalizing]

[birds singing and calling]

01:02:15.035 --> 01:02:18.125
- We could be in real trouble
here.

01:02:18.517 --> 01:02:20.301
We sent the Amore.

01:02:20.345 --> 01:02:24.479
Si, Carla [speaks Spanish].

01:02:24.523 --> 01:02:26.264
I take care, don't worry about
it, okay?

01:02:27.744 --> 01:02:29.528
I might have a solution.

01:02:29.571 --> 01:02:32.009
- You better, because if they
have her,

01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:34.185
then she can testify against
you.

01:02:34.228 --> 01:02:35.447
I'll find her.

01:02:35.490 --> 01:02:36.970
No you won't.

01:02:37.014 --> 01:02:39.016
If she's gone, it means they got
to her.

01:02:40.017 --> 01:02:42.367
And if they got to her, then
that means

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:44.673
they can bring an international
warrant against me.

01:02:46.545 --> 01:02:48.677
And if you're still here,

01:02:48.721 --> 01:02:51.768
it means that little piece
of shit is still breathing.

01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:54.466
- He is, but we have a card to
play,

01:02:54.509 --> 01:02:55.815
if you're willing to play it.

01:02:55.859 --> 01:02:59.253
- I'm willing to play
it. Do what it takes.

01:02:59.297 --> 01:03:00.341
It's messy.

01:03:00.385 --> 01:03:01.908
- Everything I did for this
island

01:03:01.952 --> 01:03:04.476
is in jeopardy because of this
man!

01:03:04.519 --> 01:03:07.696
I will make a mess if
I have to, believe me.

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:11.178
[soft suspenseful music]

01:03:23.669 --> 01:03:26.672
[crickets chirping]

01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:33.461
- I don't understand
why you just don't let

01:03:33.505 --> 01:03:34.854
Nate make a case against him.

01:03:34.898 --> 01:03:37.204
And put an end to all of this.

01:03:37.248 --> 01:03:39.163
With that singer's testimony,

01:03:39.206 --> 01:03:41.426
he'll spend the rest of his life
in jail.

01:03:41.469 --> 01:03:44.342
- Because guys like him
don't end up in jail, Akilah.

01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:48.389
- Mark, he's never going to
stop.

01:03:48.433 --> 01:03:49.173
And neither am I.

01:03:51.828 --> 01:03:53.220
There's only one way this ends.

01:03:56.049 --> 01:04:00.227
- To carry a life inside
of me, for nine months,

01:04:01.402 --> 01:04:03.361
one that you and I created
together.

01:04:05.711 --> 01:04:08.801
And to never get to hear her
cry.

01:04:10.716 --> 01:04:13.806
Or see her open her eyes to look
at me.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.156
To never get to hold her against
my skin.

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:19.246
Or see her take her first steps.

01:04:20.857 --> 01:04:22.032
Or watch her grow up.

01:04:23.076 --> 01:04:23.860
Akilah.

01:04:23.903 --> 01:04:26.253
It broke me, in more ways

01:04:26.297 --> 01:04:27.646
than I ever thought was
possible.

01:04:30.388 --> 01:04:35.088
I was so, so numb to everything
that wasn't heartache.

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:39.049
And I know it broke you too.

01:04:40.702 --> 01:04:43.488
It broke you so much
that you had to leave.

01:04:43.531 --> 01:04:45.446
- Akilah, why are you
talking about this now?

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:47.884
- Because nothing that either of
us does

01:04:47.927 --> 01:04:49.146
will ever bring her back.

01:04:50.277 --> 01:04:51.800
She's gone, Mark.

01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:54.542
You can't save her.

01:04:54.586 --> 01:04:56.588
But I can save our island.

01:04:56.631 --> 01:04:57.806
But at what cost?

01:05:00.331 --> 01:05:02.463
I don't want to lose you too.

01:05:05.553 --> 01:05:07.642
I don't think that I could
take being broken anymore.

01:05:09.253 --> 01:05:10.428
You will never lose me.

01:05:13.648 --> 01:05:17.391
[vehicle approaching]

01:05:17.435 --> 01:05:18.436

Nate?

01:05:30.970 --> 01:05:32.929
Nate? Talk to me.

01:05:35.366 --> 01:05:36.715
Wait here.

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:39.457
Nate?

01:05:41.763 --> 01:05:43.330
Nate?

01:05:43.374 --> 01:05:44.027
Mark.

01:05:49.771 --> 01:05:52.209
Nate. Hey, talk to me.

01:05:53.384 --> 01:05:55.864
Mark [breathes hard].

01:05:56.996 --> 01:06:00.391
I'm sorry about this. They're
gonna kill your family.

01:06:00.434 --> 01:06:04.003
Sh, relax. Take deep breaths.

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:07.093
Slow, slow. Everything's
gonna be all right.

01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:54.445
I'm sorry.

Sh sh, sh sh.

01:06:57.361 --> 01:06:58.144
Relax.

01:06:59.406 --> 01:07:02.975
Think about all the times we, we
were here

01:07:03.019 --> 01:07:04.890
and we played cricket together.

01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:09.155
[groans] With your brother.

01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:15.205
- I'm so glad that you were
able to help teach him for me.

01:07:16.902 --> 01:07:19.122
And he was always so
stubborn, and before long,

01:07:20.819 --> 01:07:21.994
he was better than both of us.

01:07:25.084 --> 01:07:27.391
Take care of him, my friend,

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.437
until we meet again.

[singer vocalizing]

01:07:42.188 --> 01:07:46.018
- God commands us to speak up
for those

01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:48.542
who cannot speak for themselves.

01:07:49.978 --> 01:07:51.893
For the rights of the destitute.

01:07:53.069 --> 01:07:56.855
To speak up. To judge fairly.

01:07:56.898 --> 01:07:59.553
Reach out to someone in your
community.

01:07:59.597 --> 01:08:00.902
One of your neighbors.

01:08:00.946 --> 01:08:03.949
Help those less fortunate than
yourself.

01:08:05.124 --> 01:08:06.517
This is what God--

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:08.823
[door opening]

01:08:08.867 --> 01:08:12.175
- I'm sorry, Father. May I
please speak with everyone?

01:08:12.218 --> 01:08:14.438
Just for a moment?

01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:15.613
Here.

01:08:15.656 --> 01:08:16.179
Thank you.

01:08:22.272 --> 01:08:26.058
My family immigrated to
this island from the States

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.930
when I was only two years old.

01:08:28.974 --> 01:08:33.935
Many of this community helped
us to build a new life here,

01:08:34.327 --> 01:08:36.112
so that we could call
this island our home.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:41.203
Now look, I know many of you

01:08:41.247 --> 01:08:44.685
rely on the jobs and the many
businesses

01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:48.428
owned by Manuel Alvarez.

01:08:49.951 --> 01:08:51.127
But I'm here to tell you

01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:55.131
that he has taken Akilah hostage

01:08:56.828 --> 01:08:58.917
and has killed both my brother
Akheem

01:09:00.223 --> 01:09:04.618
and now, my friend, our
police chief, Nate Wayland.

01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:07.969
[congregation gasping]

01:09:08.013 --> 01:09:10.929
Nate Wayland died an honorable
man,

01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:14.193
who fought for what's
right and for the island

01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:17.283
that we love and have called
home.

01:09:17.327 --> 01:09:22.201
Please, don't let him or
my brother die in vain.

01:09:23.288 --> 01:09:24.682
Help me find Akilah.

01:09:26.292 --> 01:09:28.947
And help me put an end to this
devil

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:32.385
who has coiled himself around
all our feet

01:09:32.429 --> 01:09:35.171
and is trying to choke the
life out of our island.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:40.305
Please, if you hear or see
anything,

01:09:42.002 --> 01:09:43.831
reach out to me at the police
station.

01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:46.094
Thank you.

01:09:47.705 --> 01:09:49.314
- That concludes everything for
today.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.016
Mark? A moment please.

01:09:56.104 --> 01:09:58.759
[birds singing]

01:10:04.939 --> 01:10:06.245
Nate asked me to hold onto it.

01:10:09.248 --> 01:10:10.336
What is it?

01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:11.468
I don't know.

01:10:11.511 --> 01:10:13.209
He said, if something happened
to him.

01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:16.821
And with his passing, I just
think

01:10:16.864 --> 01:10:18.039
he would want you to have it.

01:10:19.650 --> 01:10:20.999
Thank you, Father.

01:10:21.042 --> 01:10:23.828
[dramatic music]

01:10:30.835 --> 01:10:32.358
Wake up, bitch [laughs]!

01:10:37.363 --> 01:10:38.190
Where am I?

01:10:41.802 --> 01:10:43.500
What do you want with me?

01:10:45.328 --> 01:10:46.242
Answer me!

01:10:47.199 --> 01:10:50.376
[soft dramatic music]

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:53.161
- She's not answering you
because she don't work for you.

01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:55.947
She work for me.

01:10:59.211 --> 01:11:04.042
[sighs] And I'm getting really
tired

01:11:04.085 --> 01:11:07.001
of your boyfriend getting in my
way.

01:11:07.045 --> 01:11:10.266
- Then you're really gonna
be upset when he kills you.

01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:12.920
Oh, aren't you a clever one?

01:11:15.053 --> 01:11:18.317
But it's going to be hard to
be clever without a tongue.

01:11:19.753 --> 01:11:20.711
[Akilah spitting]

01:11:20.754 --> 01:11:23.061
[hand slapping]

01:11:23.104 --> 01:11:24.497
- You're gonna pay for that,
bitch.

01:11:25.803 --> 01:11:27.718
Then just get it over with and
kill me now

01:11:27.761 --> 01:11:28.980
if you're really gonna do it.

01:11:29.023 --> 01:11:31.199
In time, I'll do just that.

01:11:32.418 --> 01:11:37.423
But unfortunately for
you, it won't be quick.

01:11:37.467 --> 01:11:42.385
No, I'm going to take my
time and enjoy so much.

01:11:45.039 --> 01:11:49.870
Eventually, you'll beg me to
kill you.

01:11:49.914 --> 01:11:52.917
[Akilah breathing hard]

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:56.921
[soft suspenseful music]

01:11:56.964 --> 01:11:58.183
Don't leave her sight.

01:12:15.374 --> 01:12:16.201
Everyone.

01:12:17.637 --> 01:12:18.421
Listen up.

01:12:19.378 --> 01:12:22.033
[phone ringing]

01:12:23.948 --> 01:12:25.950
Nate was a good man who died

01:12:25.993 --> 01:12:28.518
fighting to protect this island.

01:12:28.561 --> 01:12:33.087
And now, I have taken over
as acting chief of police

01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:36.090
so I can do what needs to be
done.

01:12:36.134 --> 01:12:40.573
Now if any of you would like
to leave, you can leave now.

01:12:43.881 --> 01:12:44.664
Good.

01:12:45.839 --> 01:12:48.059
Now the first thing I want you
to do

01:12:48.102 --> 01:12:50.235
is get the word out all across
the island

01:12:50.278 --> 01:12:54.239
that I will be here, waiting for
Alvarez.

[suspenseful music]

01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:36.063
Okay.

01:13:37.761 --> 01:13:39.110
Cartel drug money.

01:13:40.459 --> 01:13:43.723
You've been building
a case against Alvarez

01:13:43.767 --> 01:13:45.595
for money laundering.

01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:49.250
Mm, gotcha.

01:13:55.996 --> 01:13:56.954
I won!

01:13:56.997 --> 01:13:59.478
No fair. You're taller.

[birds singing]

01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:02.133
Look, Desmond.

01:14:02.176 --> 01:14:02.960
Who's that?

01:14:03.003 --> 01:14:03.917
Sh.

01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:05.963
Come on.

[soft suspenseful music]

01:14:15.494 --> 01:14:17.148
That's the guy who's always with
him.

01:14:21.718 --> 01:14:22.283
Did he see us?

01:14:22.327 --> 01:14:23.197
No.

01:14:23.241 --> 01:14:25.025
Come on. Let's get outta here.

01:14:27.332 --> 01:14:29.987
[phone buzzing]

01:14:34.382 --> 01:14:35.862
Hello.

01:14:35.906 --> 01:14:37.951
- A police officer just came
here looking for the boss.

01:14:37.995 --> 01:14:39.387
What'd you tell him?

01:14:39.431 --> 01:14:41.389
- That he wasn't here and
I don't know where he is.

01:14:41.433 --> 01:14:43.000
- All right, you did the right
thing.

01:14:43.043 --> 01:14:44.349
Wait, there's more.

01:14:44.392 --> 01:14:46.177
Before he left, he told
me that Mark has replaced

01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:48.222
the chief of police and
now he's at the station

01:14:48.266 --> 01:14:49.833
waiting for the boss to make a
move.

01:14:51.138 --> 01:14:51.922
Understood.

01:14:53.097 --> 01:14:55.795
[phone beeping]

01:14:55.839 --> 01:14:58.145
[knocking on door]

01:14:58.189 --> 01:15:01.148
- Excuse me, sir, these two
children say that they saw

01:15:01.192 --> 01:15:03.542
something and may be able to
help you.

01:15:03.586 --> 01:15:04.978
Oh. Hello, kids.

01:15:05.936 --> 01:15:08.068
So, what did you see?

01:15:08.112 --> 01:15:09.417
Mr. Mark?

01:15:09.461 --> 01:15:11.028
Just Mark is fine.

01:15:11.071 --> 01:15:12.029
We saw him.

01:15:12.856 --> 01:15:14.074
Who did you see?

01:15:14.118 --> 01:15:17.295
- The man who is always
with the Manuel guy.

01:15:17.338 --> 01:15:21.081
- Oh, mean-looking guy, looks
like Mr. Clean, never smiles?

01:15:21.125 --> 01:15:22.082
Yeah, that's him.

01:15:23.562 --> 01:15:25.564
So, where was this?

01:15:25.608 --> 01:15:28.785
- We saw him at the old
abandoned hotel.

01:15:28.828 --> 01:15:30.003
The one by the water?

01:15:30.047 --> 01:15:30.874
Yep.

01:15:33.529 --> 01:15:35.705
You two kids did very well.

01:15:35.748 --> 01:15:40.187
But listen, do not go
anywhere near there, okay?

01:15:40.231 --> 01:15:42.842
And tell nobody. It's
very, very important.

01:15:42.886 --> 01:15:43.669
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:46.672
All right, run along.

01:15:48.892 --> 01:15:49.675
Thanks, Sergeant.

01:15:53.113 --> 01:15:55.028
Awfully young for some CIs.

01:15:56.508 --> 01:15:58.510
- Phil, what the hell are you
doing here?

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:00.556
- Not exactly a warm island
welcome.

01:16:00.599 --> 01:16:02.558
It's nice to see you too,
partner.

01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:05.212
This does not concern you.

01:16:05.256 --> 01:16:07.432
Oh, it doesn't concern me.

01:16:07.475 --> 01:16:12.089
Well, um, I have been
stashing potential witnesses

01:16:12.132 --> 01:16:14.352
for you in safe houses
and running fingerprints

01:16:14.395 --> 01:16:16.572
for your buddy Nate on a
Colombia sicario

01:16:16.615 --> 01:16:18.399
working for the Cali Cartel.

01:16:18.443 --> 01:16:20.140
But, sure, it doesn't concern
me.

01:16:20.184 --> 01:16:22.012
I'm good, by the way.
Thank you, for not asking.

01:16:25.102 --> 01:16:26.320
How's the girl?

01:16:26.364 --> 01:16:29.236
- She's safe. Hence the word
safe house.

01:16:30.281 --> 01:16:31.151
How's your buddy Nate?

01:16:32.413 --> 01:16:34.459
Well he's been killed.

01:16:34.502 --> 01:16:37.288
Hence, why I'm sitting at his
desk.

01:16:39.551 --> 01:16:42.598
- Then I guess you need my
help more than I thought.

01:16:42.641 --> 01:16:45.165
Come on, cut the bullshit,
man. Catch me up.

01:16:47.472 --> 01:16:49.953
[Mark sighing]

01:16:49.996 --> 01:16:52.956
[suspenseful music]

01:16:59.963 --> 01:17:02.356
[phone buzzing]

01:17:05.446 --> 01:17:06.230
Who's this?

01:17:07.144 --> 01:17:09.146
- [Manuel] I think it's time we
meet.

01:17:09.581 --> 01:17:10.887
When and where?

01:17:12.018 --> 01:17:15.282
Tomorrow. 7:00 AM.

01:17:15.326 --> 01:17:17.023
At the old sugar factory in
ruin.

01:17:17.937 --> 01:17:20.853
Come alone. Unarmed.

01:17:20.897 --> 01:17:23.334
And bring Nora. I'll bring
Akilah.

01:17:25.205 --> 01:17:27.120
I need to know she's alive.

01:17:35.172 --> 01:17:37.870
- Your boyfriend, he want
to know you're still alive.

01:17:37.914 --> 01:17:40.830
- Mark, don't worry about
me! Kill the bastard!

01:17:40.873 --> 01:17:43.006
Oh, she's a nasty one.

01:17:43.659 --> 01:17:44.616
7:00 AM.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.054
[soft suspenseful music]

01:17:57.020 --> 01:17:59.413
[phone ringing]

01:18:01.111 --> 01:18:02.547
Oh, yo, Mark, what's up, man?

01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:05.289
This beach house you got me
is fucking bitchin', dude.

01:18:05.332 --> 01:18:07.073
I could see myself
staying here a long time.

01:18:07.117 --> 01:18:09.249
Phil, Phil, listen.

01:18:09.293 --> 01:18:12.165
I just spoke to Alvarez. I
need you to assemble a team.

01:18:12.209 --> 01:18:14.341
We leave first thing in the
morning.

01:18:14.385 --> 01:18:15.168
Copy that, buddy.

01:18:16.735 --> 01:18:19.216
[engine starting]

01:18:19.259 --> 01:18:22.219
[suspenseful music]

01:18:39.715 --> 01:18:42.282
[engine stopping]

01:18:45.068 --> 01:18:46.243
I'm here. What's your 20?

01:18:48.071 --> 01:18:50.726
- Little busy. Let me get back
to you.

01:18:50.769 --> 01:18:54.120
[intense dramatic music]

01:19:12.138 --> 01:19:14.488
Moving in position now.

01:19:14.532 --> 01:19:16.621
- All right, you got five
minutes.

01:19:16.664 --> 01:19:18.144
Okay, Dad.

01:19:18.188 --> 01:19:20.364
I'm embarrassed you think
it's gonna take me that long.

01:19:20.407 --> 01:19:22.105
- Well I'm accounting for
four minutes of your blabbing

01:19:22.148 --> 01:19:24.368
and one minute of actual action.

01:19:24.411 --> 01:19:25.586
- You know, this only works
if one of us is the funny one

01:19:25.630 --> 01:19:27.719
and the other one's mean and
gruff, right?

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:30.635
- Hurry the fuck up and
save Akilah. Better?

01:19:30.678 --> 01:19:33.029
I did miss you. Going dark.

01:19:44.214 --> 01:19:47.347
[intense dramatic music]

01:20:04.712 --> 01:20:07.193
[guns firing]

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:14.244
Let's move. Come on!

01:20:15.201 --> 01:20:18.291
[soft suspenseful music]

01:20:24.776 --> 01:20:27.648
[footsteps crunching]

01:20:27.692 --> 01:20:31.087
[soft suspenseful music]

01:20:39.312 --> 01:20:41.140
[gun clicking]

01:20:44.665 --> 01:20:45.231
Hands up.

01:21:00.725 --> 01:21:02.292
He's clean.

01:21:02.335 --> 01:21:03.162
Good.

01:21:10.169 --> 01:21:12.519
Well, I appreciate a man who
shows up

01:21:12.563 --> 01:21:14.608
early for an appointment.

01:21:14.652 --> 01:21:16.262
Where's Akilah?

01:21:16.306 --> 01:21:17.568
Where is Nora?

01:21:17.611 --> 01:21:20.353
- You'll get her as soon
as I know Akilah's safe.

01:21:20.919 --> 01:21:23.879
- You know, I don't think you're
really

01:21:23.922 --> 01:21:25.619
in a position to negotiate here.

01:21:25.663 --> 01:21:26.751
Where is she?

01:21:27.926 --> 01:21:29.101
I just need to make a call.

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.844
- Well, I suggest you do just
that.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:36.021
[soft suspenseful music]

01:21:38.937 --> 01:21:40.025
I need you to bring her now.

01:21:42.898 --> 01:21:44.116
Do you copy?

01:21:46.597 --> 01:21:48.860
[intense dramatic music]

01:22:13.754 --> 01:22:16.235
[guns firing]

01:22:17.889 --> 01:22:20.718
- Talk to me. Is there a
problem?

01:22:20.761 --> 01:22:24.200
- No problem. It's just that
we're here early, remember?

01:22:26.724 --> 01:22:28.508
Don't waste my fucking time.

01:22:28.552 --> 01:22:32.425
- Wait wait. Wait, hey,
let's talk about this, huh?

01:22:32.469 --> 01:22:35.254
- Drop it and come out real
slow.

01:22:35.298 --> 01:22:38.692
- All right here, look. My gun,
all right?

01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:43.001
Here we go, okay? That's all I
want.

01:22:43.045 --> 01:22:44.307
[gun firing]

01:22:44.350 --> 01:22:45.525
[screaming]

01:22:45.569 --> 01:22:46.744
You're a dick.

01:22:48.528 --> 01:22:49.094
Shit.

01:22:50.791 --> 01:22:53.881
Hey, hey, I'm with Mark. Akilah,
right?

01:22:53.925 --> 01:22:55.405
We gotta get you outta here.

01:22:55.448 --> 01:22:57.842

[thug shouting in Spanish]

01:23:02.238 --> 01:23:03.239
Drop the gun!

01:23:03.282 --> 01:23:05.415
- All right, hey, taking the gun
out.

01:23:05.458 --> 01:23:07.765
Taking the gun out. Okay?

01:23:07.808 --> 01:23:08.679
[Thug] Guns!

01:23:08.722 --> 01:23:10.986
Okay, okay [speaks Spanish].

01:23:11.029 --> 01:23:12.509
Shut up!

01:23:12.552 --> 01:23:15.338
[speaks Spanish] See?

01:23:16.469 --> 01:23:17.383
See?

01:23:17.427 --> 01:23:19.081
Okay, okay.

01:23:19.124 --> 01:23:21.866
Tranqilo, amigo, huh [speaks
Spanish].

01:23:21.909 --> 01:23:22.780
Hey!

[Phil chuckling]

01:23:37.403 --> 01:23:39.057
She, she's safe, Mark.

01:23:39.101 --> 01:23:40.363
[Phil] She's safe.

01:23:41.494 --> 01:23:44.410
- It's seven o'clock. Where is
she?

01:23:44.454 --> 01:23:46.195
- Nora won't be coming back to
the island.

01:23:47.805 --> 01:23:49.763
She's safe.

01:23:49.807 --> 01:23:52.114
[suspenseful music]

01:23:52.157 --> 01:23:55.726
- Well, I wish I could say
the same for Akilah. Kill her.

01:24:01.949 --> 01:24:03.212

Did you hear me? Kill
the [shouts in Spanish]!

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.046
- I don't believe they can hear
you,

01:24:11.089 --> 01:24:13.700
because they're in the
afterlife.

01:24:13.744 --> 01:24:17.095
[suspenseful music]

01:24:17.139 --> 01:24:20.577
Well, then,

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:22.013
I have no more use for you.

01:24:22.057 --> 01:24:23.232
Kill him.

01:24:55.220 --> 01:24:58.180
- You're right, Alvarez.
Things are changing.

01:24:59.137 --> 01:25:00.007
Starting with you.

01:25:02.053 --> 01:25:02.836
Now what?

01:25:04.273 --> 01:25:07.537
You're just gonna let your
little friends shoot me?

01:25:09.713 --> 01:25:10.801
I thought about it.

01:25:11.932 --> 01:25:13.499
But I'm gonna give you a choice

01:25:13.543 --> 01:25:15.893
that you didn't give my brother.

01:25:15.936 --> 01:25:19.592
You wanna live? You
have to get through me.

01:25:19.636 --> 01:25:22.117
[dramatic music]

01:25:26.904 --> 01:25:29.036
Let us shoot him, brother.

[soft music]

01:25:36.653 --> 01:25:39.786
- I wish you could have
seen your brother's eyes

01:25:40.961 --> 01:25:42.920
when I bled the life from his
body.

01:25:44.226 --> 01:25:46.141
- I guess I'm gonna have
to settle for yours.

01:25:47.751 --> 01:25:50.841
[soft suspenseful music]

01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:57.717

[Manuel groaning]

01:26:34.319 --> 01:26:36.930
- You don't know what you're
dealing with.

01:26:36.974 --> 01:26:39.759
My associates will come for you.

01:26:39.803 --> 01:26:42.153
I look forward to it.

01:26:42.197 --> 01:26:43.633

01:26:43.676 --> 01:26:46.288
[flesh tearing]

01:26:48.507 --> 01:26:50.509
I told you the weather
was gonna be bad for you.

01:26:52.119 --> 01:26:55.427
Now, look at me. This is the
last face you will ever see.

01:26:56.863 --> 01:26:58.300
Take it to hell with you.

01:26:58.343 --> 01:27:01.738
