10:42.017 --> 10:43.184
Get off him!

10:43.185 --> 10:44.643
[grunts]

10:44.644 --> 10:46.437
Not until he's dead.

10:46.438 --> 10:48.689
Last warning. I don't want to hurt you.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.942
[Multi-Pauls echoing] You can't hurt us

10:51.943 --> 10:55.988
no matter how strong you are,
because you're all alone.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.865
[grunting]

10:57.866 --> 10:59.825
[Mark] Shit.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.912
[grunting]

11:04.039 --> 11:05.540
[yelling]

11:15.550 --> 11:16.676
[female voice] Stop!

11:18.220 --> 11:20.263
Holy shit.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.768
It's... [grunting]

11:25.769 --> 11:27.895
You guys...

11:27.896 --> 11:29.897
you guys can see her, too, right?

11:29.898 --> 11:31.565
It's not just me?

11:31.566 --> 11:33.150
[Multi-Pauls] Kate?

11:33.151 --> 11:35.361
They said you were dead.

11:35.362 --> 11:38.447
You, out of everyone,

11:38.448 --> 11:41.325
- should know how hard we are to kill.
- [grunts]

11:41.326 --> 11:42.910
[grunts]

11:42.911 --> 11:45.579
Kate. You're alive.

11:45.580 --> 11:46.914
But... [sighs]

11:46.915 --> 11:49.500
[stammers] Why didn't you... [grunts]

11:49.501 --> 11:52.920
You let me and Rae think you were dead.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.880
What the hell, man?

11:54.881 --> 11:56.132
It was her decision.

11:56.133 --> 11:58.759
She wanted to disappear for a while.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.095
Yeah, well... [coughs]

12:01.096 --> 12:03.722
it almost got me disappeared, too.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.891
[sighs] Wait.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.102
You knew?

12:08.103 --> 12:11.439
Aw, fuck you, Immortal.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.817
And you, you fucking psycho.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.736
You almost murdered me for nothing.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.905
I've killed people for less.

12:19.906 --> 12:21.949
Yeah, like me!

12:21.950 --> 12:24.493
Just now, you frigging idiot.

12:24.494 --> 12:28.330
Paul, just go before you make this worse.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.374
[Rex] Oh, that's rich.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.793
What's worse than this?

12:32.794 --> 12:34.421
[grunts]

12:37.382 --> 12:39.175
Wait!

12:39.176 --> 12:42.511
No, Kate. Paul almost killed Rex,

12:42.512 --> 12:46.474
and because of him, those guys got away
with the Declaration of Independence.

12:46.475 --> 12:48.225
- [Immortal] What?
- I don't care if he's your brother.

12:48.226 --> 12:51.729
He's going to prison. Now.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.731
[April] <i>Go on.</i>

12:53.732 --> 12:56.192
[Oliver] John Witherspoon,

12:56.193 --> 12:58.110
Oliver Wolcott,

12:58.111 --> 13:00.696
and...

13:00.697 --> 13:02.865
George Wythe.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.326
[chuckles] Bravo.

13:05.327 --> 13:07.995
Your memory, Oliver--
it's quite astounding.

13:07.996 --> 13:11.081
Now can I go play? 'Cause that
was the deal if I got them all right.

13:11.082 --> 13:14.043
Did I say that? I don't know.

13:14.044 --> 13:17.421
- You promised. I remember.
- [chuckles]

13:17.422 --> 13:20.007
- Of course. We're done for the day.
- [door opens]

13:20.008 --> 13:21.009
Yes!

13:22.385 --> 13:24.303
Hi, Mom. Going outside to play.
See you later.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.014
[chuckles] They say they grow up fast...

13:27.015 --> 13:30.309
Mm, but Oliver puts
every other child to shame.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.521
His growth and development
are off the charts,

13:33.522 --> 13:36.941
but they should start to level off
once he reaches puberty.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.943
Oh. So, tomorrow.

13:38.944 --> 13:42.905
Not quite that soon, but... soon.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.074
[sighs]

13:45.075 --> 13:46.992
Hi, April.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.745
Um, you know stuff.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.414
How important is
the Declaration of Independence again?

13:52.415 --> 13:55.960
Ask your brother. See you both tomorrow!

13:55.961 --> 13:58.337
- [door opens, closes]
- [sighs]

13:58.338 --> 14:01.006
Well if you hadn't dropped out
of college, you'd know, too.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.426
- Mom.
- I'm kidding.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.387
I'm glad to have you home.

14:06.388 --> 14:09.640
Especially with Oliver
growing up so quickly.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.475
[sighs]

14:11.476 --> 14:14.104
He really looks up to you, you know.

14:16.481 --> 14:19.191
And then what happened? [grunts]

14:19.192 --> 14:23.572
I had to save Rex from, like,
a hundred Multi-Pauls.

14:24.656 --> 14:26.991
But the real bad guys got away.

14:26.992 --> 14:29.702
Yeah. Sometimes that happens.

14:29.703 --> 14:33.789
If I was there, I would've
made sure we got them. [grunts]

14:33.790 --> 14:37.251
[chuckles] I bet you would.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.712
I made drawings of my costume,
and I'm practicing my moves.

14:39.713 --> 14:43.340
We'll be a team, right? You'll teach me,
and we'll go fight bad guys?

14:43.341 --> 14:45.926
Sure. Once you get your powers.

14:45.927 --> 14:46.969
Promise.

14:46.970 --> 14:49.888
I promise, but remember,
I didn't get my powers

14:49.889 --> 14:51.807
until I was way older than...

14:51.808 --> 14:53.768
- [grunts]
- ...you.

14:54.853 --> 14:56.980
Too late. You promised.

15:00.275 --> 15:02.193
[groaning]

15:04.863 --> 15:06.947
What happened to you?

15:06.948 --> 15:12.745
I volunteered for an ass-kicking,
which I will never do again.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.956
But that's only the second weirdest thing
that happened today.

15:15.957 --> 15:17.417
Check it out.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.378
Uh... hey. [weak chuckle]

15:21.379 --> 15:24.882
Holy shit. Kate? Kate!

15:24.883 --> 15:27.885
- [laughs] Aw.
- I missed you guys.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.471
But not enough to tell us she was alive,

15:30.472 --> 15:33.098
so figure that one out.

15:33.099 --> 15:36.685
I needed some time, on my own.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.687
Or so I thought.

15:38.688 --> 15:39.813
[Bulletproof] Kate.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.482
How did you survive?

15:41.483 --> 15:44.026
I always keep a copy for safekeeping.

15:44.027 --> 15:47.363
We're both rejoining the Guardians,
effective immediately.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.531
Also...

15:50.784 --> 15:51.867
[Monster Girl] Shut up.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.286
Kate, are you guys engaged?

15:54.287 --> 15:57.831
I forged the ring myself
using metals I mined from--

15:57.832 --> 16:00.125
[laughs] Yeah. Let me see.

16:00.126 --> 16:02.879
- Oh, my gosh, it's perfect. Oh, my God.
- [Rex groaning]

16:05.048 --> 16:07.049
[Black Samson] I'm glad
you're sitting down, Rex,

16:07.050 --> 16:10.969
'cause it's a full-on
family reunion today.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.638
Hey, Rex.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.931
Rae!

16:13.932 --> 16:16.058
Oh. [grunts]

16:16.059 --> 16:19.353
Oh, this hurts so much,

16:19.354 --> 16:21.772
but I don't even care.

16:21.773 --> 16:25.734
Doc says she's all healed up
and ready to get back to saving the world.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.320
I heard you came to the hospital a lot.

16:28.321 --> 16:29.822
Of course I did.

16:29.823 --> 16:33.158
We almost got killed together,
so that makes us, like, uh...

16:33.159 --> 16:34.243
Losers?

16:34.244 --> 16:37.037
Uh, I was gonna say too hot to live,

16:37.038 --> 16:38.789
too cool to die,

16:38.790 --> 16:40.374
but sure.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.210
[Black Samson] Ain't nothing
gonna stand up to us now.

16:43.211 --> 16:47.047
The family's back, baby, and unbreakable.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.549
<i>[Cecil sighs]</i>

16:48.550 --> 16:50.426
Enlighten me.

16:50.427 --> 16:52.511
It's nothing specific sir, but

16:52.512 --> 16:56.098
the residents of this town reported
that their groundwater's

16:56.099 --> 16:59.059
recently become sulfurous and undrinkable.

16:59.060 --> 17:00.811
[Cecil] We're not the EPA, Donald.

17:00.812 --> 17:04.189
[Donald] There's been a chain of small
earthquakes throughout this region.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.358
Well, they frack there, don't they?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.818
Children here have reported

17:07.819 --> 17:11.238
hearing strange sounds
from a local cave system.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.906
Well, children hear a lot of things.

17:12.907 --> 17:16.910
There's been three subway derailments
in the last month in New York,

17:16.911 --> 17:20.748
all traced back to small shifts
in the tunnel foundations.

17:20.749 --> 17:22.833
And the connection between all of this?

17:22.834 --> 17:25.669
I... Uh, I-I don't have one yet.

17:25.670 --> 17:29.965
But we've categorized over 300
unusual geological events, sir.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.719
Well, map them out.

17:39.350 --> 17:42.227
[sighs] So, the country's got measles.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.813
They do seem to be centered
around major cities,

17:44.814 --> 17:47.733
but there's no other pattern
we can find yet.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.235
And our resident earthquaker?

17:51.571 --> 17:53.071
Hmm.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.909
Well, when it graduates to more
than a giant coincidence, call me.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.411
Uh, there's one other thing

17:59.412 --> 18:01.372
you should see, sir.

18:03.792 --> 18:07.044
- [Oliver] <i>Too late. You promised!</i>
- [sighs]

18:07.045 --> 18:08.962
This, Donald.

18:08.963 --> 18:11.174
You should have led with this.

18:12.634 --> 18:15.219
You were 17 when you got your powers.

18:15.220 --> 18:17.638
Which, honestly, was still too early.

18:17.639 --> 18:20.724
And the fact that Oliver kept them
a secret-- I mean, that worries me.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.893
He just wanted to surprise me.

18:22.894 --> 18:25.020
[sighs] He's too young.

18:25.021 --> 18:28.106
He might get hurt,
or hurt someone else by accident.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.900
I made him promise not to use his powers

18:29.901 --> 18:32.694
until we all had time to talk about it.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.655
And to not keep any more secrets.

18:34.656 --> 18:37.616
He's a kid.
You think he's not gonna try them out?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.201
You would have.

18:39.202 --> 18:41.120
He promised. [kisses]

18:47.293 --> 18:49.587
[William] <i>Stree-rike!</i>

18:50.922 --> 18:52.881
[grunts] Ha!

18:52.882 --> 18:54.424
[laughs]

18:54.425 --> 18:56.260
I just want to point out that here I am,

18:56.261 --> 19:00.013
the only guy without superpowers
or a banging cyborg body,

19:00.014 --> 19:01.890
and I just beat both your butts

19:01.891 --> 19:05.435
for the third time in a row. Boom.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.688
Maybe bowling's his superpower.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.356
I think so.

19:09.357 --> 19:13.277
So, Mark, we've been here two hours,
and you still haven't brought it up.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.611
Brought up what?

19:14.612 --> 19:17.155
Oh, come on. I know that look.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.491
There's something you
desperately want to talk about

19:19.492 --> 19:22.202
but you're too scared
to just say whatever it is.

19:22.203 --> 19:24.705
[sighs] It's that obvious?

19:24.706 --> 19:27.708
- Even I see it.
- [Mark] Okay.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.377
Remember when I was trapped
in that dimension with Angstrom?

19:30.378 --> 19:32.754
And that other Eve showed up to save me?

19:32.755 --> 19:36.301
I didn't tell you guys
everything she said.

19:39.470 --> 19:41.722
[electronic melody plays]

19:41.723 --> 19:44.850
So, the other Eve
said she always loved you

19:44.851 --> 19:48.186
and that you needed to either
love her back or let her go

19:48.187 --> 19:51.148
- because you were ruining her life?
- [Mark] Pretty much.

19:51.149 --> 19:53.609
[Rick] Do you have feelings for Eve?

19:53.610 --> 19:56.403
Yeah. I do.

19:56.404 --> 19:59.615
And I've had them for a while, but...

19:59.616 --> 20:01.783
should I tell her about the other her?

20:01.784 --> 20:04.620
Hard no.
That's super weird and awkward.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.622
Do not go there.

20:06.623 --> 20:10.542
[Rick] William's right.
This other her isn't her.

20:10.543 --> 20:13.503
Just ask this Eve out. See where it goes.

20:13.504 --> 20:16.548
Maybe? I-I don't know.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.801
If I ask Eve out, I want to be honest
with her from the start.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.303
Not like I was with Amber.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.347
There's a big difference
between being honest

20:23.348 --> 20:25.307
and being too honest,

20:25.308 --> 20:28.352
- and this is definitely the latter.
- I agre-- [groans]

20:28.353 --> 20:29.645
Ah...

20:29.646 --> 20:31.980
- Rick?
- [panting]

20:31.981 --> 20:35.067
It's his heart.
He's still having pain from...

20:35.068 --> 20:36.568
what Sinclair did.

20:36.569 --> 20:37.861
[groans]

20:37.862 --> 20:41.031
Ah, it's okay. I'm getting used to it.

20:41.032 --> 20:43.200
But you should talk to Eve.

20:43.201 --> 20:44.826
If there's one thing I've learned,
it's that

20:44.827 --> 20:47.829
life can change in an instant.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.498
So don't wait.

20:49.499 --> 20:52.460
Thanks, Rick. That's good advice.

20:54.337 --> 20:56.422
But leave the other her out of it.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.842
[engine sputtering]

21:02.553 --> 21:06.849
Um... how are we gonna get back to campus?

21:07.934 --> 21:10.352
Say, Mark...

21:10.353 --> 21:13.189
[laughs] Ho, ho! Do a loop!

21:23.241 --> 21:24.533
[exhales]

21:24.534 --> 21:26.493
Okay.

21:26.494 --> 21:29.038
Just tell her how you feel. Easy.

21:31.165 --> 21:34.751
Oh, God, how am I more nervous
about this than fighting aliens?

21:34.752 --> 21:38.756
[Eve] Are you gonna hover out there
all day talking to yourself or come in?

21:42.760 --> 21:44.177
[Debbie] <i>If you want</i>

21:44.178 --> 21:46.138
- to go to the zoo, then stop squirming.
- [whimpers]

21:46.139 --> 21:48.598
But you and April always say
I should be myself.

21:48.599 --> 21:51.643
Yes, yes, and that's true,

21:51.644 --> 21:54.896
but you want to be a superhero, right?

21:54.897 --> 21:58.233
And you know that many superheroes
have secret identities.

21:58.234 --> 22:01.696
- Even your brother.
- Yeah...

22:02.739 --> 22:03.989
- Well...
- [groans]

22:03.990 --> 22:07.075
...this is your secret identity.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.536
Cool!

22:11.414 --> 22:14.583
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about my powers.

22:14.584 --> 22:17.044
[sighs] That's okay, Oliver.

22:17.045 --> 22:18.920
- But no more secrets.
- [doorbell rings]

22:18.921 --> 22:20.922
Huh? I'll get it!

22:20.923 --> 22:22.925
Wait, wait. I'm not finished.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.597
Think you missed a spot there, kiddo.

22:28.598 --> 22:29.973
[gasps]

22:29.974 --> 22:31.892
I'm Cecil Stedman.

22:31.893 --> 22:33.310
I've heard of you.

22:33.311 --> 22:36.188
You tell superheroes what to do and
if they don't listen, you get super mad.

22:36.189 --> 22:38.648
Hm. That's about right.

22:38.649 --> 22:40.650
And I've also heard of you.

22:40.651 --> 22:43.696
Good, because I'm almost a superhero, too.

22:44.697 --> 22:47.408
That's why I'm here. [sighs]

22:48.659 --> 22:50.994
[Eve] <i>Uh, yeah, they're both good.</i>

22:50.995 --> 22:55.123
My dad got another furniture job, so
he's not working at Burger Mart anymore,

22:55.124 --> 22:58.752
and, well, my mom's helping out
at a preschool near our house.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.295
How's your mom?

23:00.296 --> 23:04.007
Uh, her arm's totally healed,
so she's doing okay.

23:04.008 --> 23:06.343
I think she likes having
me and Oliver around.

23:06.344 --> 23:08.845
Except, guess who can fly now.

23:08.846 --> 23:11.181
Oliver?! Wait, already?

23:11.182 --> 23:13.767
Oh, oh, man. I feel for your mom.

23:13.768 --> 23:15.685
How are you gonna keep him in the house?

23:15.686 --> 23:17.687
I don't know yet.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.440
- Are you going to college?
- Yeah.

23:20.817 --> 23:22.400
I realized my dad was right.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.736
I am not an architect or an engineer.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.572
I mean, look at this place.
It's barely staying up here.

23:27.573 --> 23:32.077
So, I signed up for part-time classes.
I start next week.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.662
That's amazing.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.372
Thanks.

23:35.373 --> 23:36.998
It's weird, though.

23:36.999 --> 23:40.919
Why is going to school more nerve-racking
than fighting aliens?

23:40.920 --> 23:44.339
[chuckles] I... know the feeling.

23:44.340 --> 23:46.217
So...

23:47.635 --> 23:49.303
Why are you really here, Mark?

23:50.847 --> 23:52.431
[sighs] Okay.

23:53.808 --> 23:56.310
I've been thinking
about this a lot, and...

23:57.436 --> 23:59.479
...I want to see if we--

23:59.480 --> 24:02.274
meaning you and me--

24:02.275 --> 24:04.401
if-if we could, um,

24:04.402 --> 24:07.404
you know, work together,

24:07.405 --> 24:11.575
but, l-like, as people,
not-not work-work.

24:11.576 --> 24:15.203
Are you... asking me out?

24:15.204 --> 24:17.914
Uh, yeah.

24:17.915 --> 24:21.002
[chuckles] I mean,
I'm just doing a terrible job at it.

24:24.881 --> 24:26.840
April doesn't know, so don't blame her.

24:26.841 --> 24:28.842
Even I only found out yesterday.

24:28.843 --> 24:31.052
I would've appreciated a call.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.804
You found out anyway.

24:32.805 --> 24:34.764
And I don't work for you.

24:34.765 --> 24:37.142
I thought we agreed
to trust each other, Debbie.

24:37.143 --> 24:41.271
[chuckles] I'm sorry, but Cecil, please.

24:41.272 --> 24:44.316
Mark, and now Oliver,
are players in a game

24:44.317 --> 24:46.694
that involves the entire Earth and beyond.

24:47.778 --> 24:51.323
And like it or not, Debbie,
you're a part of this, too.

24:51.324 --> 24:54.951
Cecil, how many times
do we have to have this conversation?

24:54.952 --> 24:58.788
My responsibilities
will always be to my family first.

24:58.789 --> 25:00.498
And that's never going to change.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.418
No matter what.

25:05.546 --> 25:07.881
[ominous music playing]

25:07.882 --> 25:09.884

25:16.641 --> 25:18.684
[Rex whistling a tune]

25:23.397 --> 25:24.732
What the hell?

25:25.733 --> 25:27.359
Oh, Jesus Christ.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.195
Are you serious?

25:32.073 --> 25:36.451
Cecil spends ten gajillion dollars
on Mark's fitness classes,

25:36.452 --> 25:39.162
but can't fix our goddamn-- Oh!

25:39.163 --> 25:42.332
What the fuck is this?

25:42.333 --> 25:44.417
[growling]

25:44.418 --> 25:47.588
- [screeching]
- [screams]

25:48.589 --> 25:50.006
Lost contact completely.

25:50.007 --> 25:51.841
- No response from the team.
- Over 100 earthquakes reported.

25:51.842 --> 25:53.718
- [agent] I can't get anyone on the line.
- I need you to go in there

25:53.719 --> 25:55.470
- and check it out.
- Sorry, it's all I know.

25:55.471 --> 25:58.473
Sir, we have intense geological events
all over the country.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.725
But, worse, we can't reach a single hero.

26:00.726 --> 26:02.602
Even the Guardians have gone silent.

26:02.603 --> 26:05.481
Most heroes carry a GDA tracker.
Th-Throw them up on the screen.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.817
- [agents gasping]
- [indistinct chatter]

26:08.818 --> 26:10.403
Show me Seismic.

26:12.989 --> 26:13.947
Oh, no.

26:13.948 --> 26:16.491
- [male agent] Report, report.
- [female agent] Code red, right now.

26:16.492 --> 26:17.617
[overlapping chatter]

26:17.618 --> 26:19.703
[Debbie] <i>I'm sorry,
but I can't agree to that.</i>

26:19.704 --> 26:21.621
[Cecil] <i>It would only
be for a few hours a day.</i>

26:21.622 --> 26:23.957
We can monitor his superpowers
more closely,

26:23.958 --> 26:26.501
help him understand and control them.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.753
There's that word again.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.547
You know what I mean.

26:30.548 --> 26:34.093
There's no way I'm letting you
take Oliver to your...

26:35.761 --> 26:37.220
...lab.

26:37.221 --> 26:39.306
The only reason I even let April in here
is because I trust her.

26:39.307 --> 26:40.849
Ouch.

26:40.850 --> 26:44.352
Cecil, I understand you have a job to do.

26:44.353 --> 26:48.064
But I also know that everything else
is secondary to that job.

26:48.065 --> 26:52.152
And that's why I can never trust you
with either Mark or Oliver's lives.

26:52.153 --> 26:54.571
Other people have sons and daughters, too.

26:54.572 --> 26:57.198
Sons and daughters
who aren't as lucky as your boys.

26:57.199 --> 26:59.660
- That is not fair.
- What?

27:00.786 --> 27:02.245
What are you talking about?

27:02.246 --> 27:05.206
- What, every single one?
- What's going on?

27:05.207 --> 27:07.375
Every superhero in America
has been abducted.

27:07.376 --> 27:09.295
Except for two.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.715
[Mark] <i>Uh... Eve?</i>

27:13.716 --> 27:15.342
Okay.

27:15.343 --> 27:16.593
Okay?

27:16.594 --> 27:19.013
Sure. Let's try.

27:20.056 --> 27:21.264
[chuckles] Really?

27:21.265 --> 27:22.849
I mean, it makes sense, right?

27:22.850 --> 27:25.435
We're both superheroes,
we know what comes with the territory.

27:25.436 --> 27:29.397
I-I-- We've already been through a bunch
of life or death situations together.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.441
So...

27:31.442 --> 27:33.443
let's try and see what happens.

27:33.444 --> 27:35.780
[chuckles] T-That's great.

27:36.947 --> 27:38.281
Oh, man, I-I...

27:38.282 --> 27:40.200
I just didn't want to leave you
hanging anymore.

27:40.201 --> 27:41.785
What?

27:41.786 --> 27:46.081
Leave me hanging? Uh, you asked me out.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.875
No, I meant...

27:50.544 --> 27:53.671
Remember that other you I told you about?

27:53.672 --> 27:54.756
Yeah.

27:54.757 --> 27:56.466
She just-- [chuckles]

27:56.467 --> 27:57.926
She said she always loved me

27:57.927 --> 28:01.137
and not knowing if I loved her back
was killing her,

28:01.138 --> 28:03.848
so she told me I should
either ask you out or...

28:03.849 --> 28:05.141
shut it down forever.

28:05.142 --> 28:08.144
Wait, I-I'm sorry,
so you're only asking me out now

28:08.145 --> 28:11.439
because the other me, who is not me,

28:11.440 --> 28:13.776
told you how miserably she was?

28:15.152 --> 28:17.153
Wait, uh, no, that-- that's not it.

28:17.154 --> 28:19.656
Did you have feelings for me
before you met her?

28:19.657 --> 28:21.074
Eve, I mean-- Of course.

28:21.075 --> 28:23.701
Or are you only here
because you feel sorry for me?

28:23.702 --> 28:28.165
Oh, God, no. I--
That's not what I meant. I...

28:29.166 --> 28:31.544
Cecil, please, not now.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.255
What do you mean?

28:36.048 --> 28:38.174
Just Eve and I?

28:38.175 --> 28:39.592
[shaky inhale]

28:39.593 --> 28:41.387
Eve, there's, uh, a problem.

28:42.471 --> 28:44.473
This better be fucking cataclysmic.

[Doc Seismic] <i>Patience is a virtue.</i>

29:05.661 --> 29:08.413
<i>It took months for me and my friends</i>

29:08.414 --> 29:12.333
<i>to learn all of your
particular vibrations.</i>

29:12.334 --> 29:14.294
<i>How you move,</i>

29:14.295 --> 29:16.797
how you breathe.

29:17.798 --> 29:21.759
The pitter-patter
of your black, little hearts.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.761
I think you'll agree

29:23.762 --> 29:25.597
it was worth

29:25.598 --> 29:28.933
- every minute of my incarceration.
- [all grunting]

29:28.934 --> 29:30.768
[both grunting, straining]

29:30.769 --> 29:33.271
I tried to change your corrupt system.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.315
Tear down your false idols.

29:35.316 --> 29:38.651
Take back what you stole from the earth.

29:38.652 --> 29:40.403
But every time I was stopped

29:40.404 --> 29:43.740
by you superpowered fascists,

29:43.741 --> 29:47.243
fighting to keep
your capitalistic slave machine running,

29:47.244 --> 29:49.454
until now.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.499
You haven't stopped a thing!

29:53.083 --> 29:54.876
[grunts]

29:54.877 --> 29:56.294
You're crushing us.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.172
Aw, shit! Stop!

29:59.173 --> 30:01.508
<i>See? You're toxic,</i>

30:01.509 --> 30:03.551
<i>even to your own compatriots.</i>

30:03.552 --> 30:06.471
- Any luck?
- [Robot] I've diverted all power
to my transmitter.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.806
It should just reach
the GDA surveillance network

30:08.807 --> 30:10.225
from this far underground.

Oh, what do you want, Seismic?

30:13.729 --> 30:17.273
Oh, didn't I make that clear?

30:17.274 --> 30:21.361
Soon, you'll all feel the full weight
of the evil you've done

30:21.362 --> 30:23.656
to support your failing human race.

30:32.498 --> 30:35.959
For you are all dust.

31:07.908 --> 31:09.367
I know. I'm impressed.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.661
Well, well, well.

It's my old friends Token Diversity

31:17.251 --> 31:20.503
Um, I wouldn't talk,
Generic Mad Scientist.

31:20.504 --> 31:23.047
Now set everyone free
before this turns ugly.

31:23.048 --> 31:25.258
It turned ugly the day Homo sapiens

31:25.259 --> 31:27.469
took their first step onto land.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.433
- Hmm.
- [sighs]

31:33.434 --> 31:36.185
I take it back. I'm not impressed anymore.

31:36.186 --> 31:38.938
Oh, that wasn't an attack.

31:38.939 --> 31:41.357

How does a nobody like Doc Seismic
pull shit like this?

32:29.156 --> 32:33.201
He seems to have found allies
from somewhere deep inside the earth.

32:33.202 --> 32:35.495

Who do we have if Mark and Eve go down?

No one close, sir.
He's cleaned us out.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.421
[sighs] Open up the darkroom
and ready drop-pods one through three.

32:45.422 --> 32:46.506
Yes, sir.

<i>[strains]</i>

32:49.551 --> 32:51.761

32:51.762 --> 32:54.263
But Cecil said
all the superheroes were gone.

32:54.264 --> 32:57.392
So I wanted to go out
and help until they got back.

32:57.393 --> 33:00.395
[sighs] And I'm glad you wanted to help,

33:00.396 --> 33:02.815

33:03.941 --> 33:05.733
I don't know.

33:05.734 --> 33:08.404
Because you knew I'd say no?

33:10.114 --> 33:11.739
Hmm.

33:11.740 --> 33:14.826
Maybe that's a clue
that you shouldn't be trying to sneak out.

33:14.827 --> 33:16.286
I guess.

33:17.538 --> 33:18.996
I'm sorry, Mom.

33:18.997 --> 33:22.208
It's okay. I understand.

33:22.209 --> 33:24.502
