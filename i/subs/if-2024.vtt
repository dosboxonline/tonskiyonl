WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:07.007
[nostalgic music playing]

00:51.268 --> 00:52.617
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

00:55.707 --> 00:58.145
Oh![both laugh]

01:00.364 --> 01:03.933
[narrator] I remember my mom
always asked me

01:04.107 --> 01:05.630
to tell her a story.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.199
And I never knew why.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.333
Maybe it was just something
to make her smile.

01:12.507 --> 01:13.769
[laughing]

01:13.943 --> 01:15.162
[narrator]
To take her away from it all.

01:15.336 --> 01:17.512
[Dad] Here she comes! Aah!

01:17.686 --> 01:18.817
Salute.

01:20.210 --> 01:23.387
[narrator] It wasn'’t until
much later that I realized

01:23.561 --> 01:25.520
that these stories
she wanted me to tell

01:27.391 --> 01:29.698
had nothing to do with her
at all.

01:38.620 --> 01:42.885
When I realized that
the most important stories
we have to tell...

01:44.408 --> 01:46.410
are the ones
we tell ourselves.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.632
[blows]

01:56.986 --> 01:58.118
Whoo!

02:00.294 --> 02:01.295
Are you ready?

02:03.993 --> 02:06.387
Whoa![Mom laughs]

02:22.881 --> 02:24.883
[speaking indistinctly]

02:27.799 --> 02:29.714
Shh.

02:29.888 --> 02:33.283
Boo!Oh, my God! That is so scary!

02:37.592 --> 02:39.550
[Dad, child talking gibberish]

02:39.724 --> 02:42.249
[imitating creature] Hey, Bear,
I'’m having a conversation here.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.642
Abracadabra!

02:44.816 --> 02:49.691
Whoa! Bea, that'’s amazing!

02:57.307 --> 02:59.440
Bye, Grandma.Bye. Love you.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.284
[door opens]

03:17.458 --> 03:19.982
[Grandmother] I don'’t know
if you saw him, honey. Come in.

03:20.156 --> 03:22.332
He sometimes helps me
park the car.

03:22.506 --> 03:23.986
We were lucky to get a park,

03:24.160 --> 03:26.510
because often
by the late afternoon...

03:26.684 --> 03:27.685
Whew!

03:27.859 --> 03:29.557
...there aren'’t any. [chuckles]

03:29.731 --> 03:32.603
And then I'’ve got to go round
and round the block... [pants]

03:32.777 --> 03:36.912
...and I'’m very lucky
if I ever get one. Whew!

03:37.086 --> 03:38.261
[grunts, pants]

03:38.435 --> 03:40.220
Oh, my goodness.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.352
[chuckles] Those stairs!

03:42.526 --> 03:45.877
I mean... Oh. Right.

03:46.051 --> 03:48.967
Well... here we are.

03:49.141 --> 03:52.014
Well, come on in.
Yeah, come on in.

03:52.188 --> 03:55.583
I mean, nothing much
has changed, I don'’t think.

03:55.757 --> 03:56.801
Except, um...

03:56.975 --> 03:59.369
was that couch here
the last time?

04:00.109 --> 04:02.242
I don'’t think it was.

04:02.981 --> 04:04.418
There we are.

04:04.592 --> 04:06.202
Well, I don'’t know why
I'’m asking you that,

04:06.376 --> 04:08.813
because you were
just this high.

04:08.987 --> 04:11.903
Right. Well, I did a bit
of a shop, because, um...

04:12.077 --> 04:13.644
Well, are you-- are you--
are you hungry at all?

04:13.818 --> 04:15.167
I mean, if you...

04:15.342 --> 04:17.169
Well, right. Well, you just
tell me if you do--

04:17.344 --> 04:19.346
if you are hungry, because
the kitchen is through here.

04:26.178 --> 04:28.268
[Grandmother
speaking indistinctly]

04:51.639 --> 04:53.510
Right. Well...

04:53.684 --> 04:55.686
[clicks tongue] And here...

04:55.860 --> 04:57.427
we have some fresh sheets

04:57.601 --> 05:00.735
and, of course, some, uh, fresh
towels there on the chair.

05:01.779 --> 05:04.129
And over here,
you might remember

05:04.304 --> 05:06.131
something a little bit special.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.962
I kept every painting
you did that summer in here.

05:11.136 --> 05:13.443
I mean, I-I could barely keep
up with everything that went on

05:13.617 --> 05:15.793
in that
little head of yours.

05:16.751 --> 05:17.795
Oh, Grandma?

05:19.275 --> 05:20.320
I'’m twelve.

05:21.973 --> 05:23.671
I don'’t really do that anymore.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.238
Of course.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.111
Of course.

05:29.285 --> 05:31.592
I'’m-- I am just going to

05:31.766 --> 05:34.508
put all of this

05:34.682 --> 05:37.337
in here.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.383
Right.

05:40.905 --> 05:42.994
Done. Done.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.257
Right, we better get going,

05:45.432 --> 05:46.998
'’cause your dad'’ll
be expecting you.

05:47.172 --> 05:49.610
And, uh, you probably
want to eat with him.

05:49.784 --> 05:52.700
You could have
something here if you like.
Can I get you something?

05:52.874 --> 05:54.223
Where are my keys?

05:54.397 --> 05:55.920
I left them somewhere.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.922
Oh, keys, keys, keys.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.292
I'’ll be in in a minute.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.774
[elevator dings]

06:27.648 --> 06:29.824
[chattering]

07:13.041 --> 07:14.303
[door opens]

07:14.477 --> 07:16.740
[nurse] How are you feeling?[Dad] Feel good.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.960
I'’ll let the doctor know
you'’re here, and he'’ll go
over everything with you.

07:19.134 --> 07:21.310
Yeah, let him know I'’m here.
We'’ll go from there.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.965
Whoa!
How'’d you even get in here?

07:24.139 --> 07:25.575
Sorry about her. [chuckles]

07:25.749 --> 07:27.751
I'’m in no state to dance,
that'’s for sure.

07:27.925 --> 07:31.059
But if we were to dance, we'’re
gonna do it for real, okay?

07:31.233 --> 07:33.017
You want to?

07:33.191 --> 07:35.803
All right, she wants to go.
Let'’s go. We'’re gonna do it.

07:35.977 --> 07:37.935
Two, three, four, five, six.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.763
Yes, and you'’ve got it.

07:39.937 --> 07:42.766
Go. Yes. Yes. This is it.[nurse chuckles]

07:42.940 --> 07:44.551
Oh, what?

07:44.725 --> 07:47.292
Big finish, big finish!
Come on, girl!

07:47.467 --> 07:48.946
We'’ve never rehearsed it.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.735
Thank you, judges. Be kind.[nurse chuckles] Yes!

07:54.909 --> 07:56.867
It'’s the applause
that keeps me young.Aw.

07:57.041 --> 07:59.783
Bea, this is Janet. Janet,
this is my daughter, Bea.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.350
[Janet] It'’s lovely
to meet you, Bea.

08:01.524 --> 08:03.221
Your father'’s told me
so much about you.

08:03.395 --> 08:04.788
Nice to meet you, too.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.791
What are they giving you?Oh, this?

08:07.965 --> 08:10.228
[blows] Magic.

08:12.187 --> 08:14.537
[chuckles] All right,
I'’ll let you two catch up.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.234
Anything I could
get for you, Bea?

08:16.408 --> 08:18.367
[Dad] Do you want anything?I'’m good, thanks.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.021
Just a burger for me.

08:20.195 --> 08:21.631
Extra cheese, bacon.
Cholesterol, really.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.633
Dad.Yeah?

08:24.416 --> 08:26.244
Okay. She'’s right. Broccoli.

08:26.418 --> 08:28.116
Just all broccoli.

08:28.290 --> 08:31.119
Great. And a water maybe.
Sorry, she'’s usually more fun.

08:31.293 --> 08:32.250
[Janet chuckling]

08:32.424 --> 08:34.775
So, how was the ride down?

08:34.949 --> 08:37.691
I'’m really sorry I couldn'’t
be there to pick you up.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.736
It was Harriet'’s only time
she could rehearse,

08:39.910 --> 08:41.651
and she'’s a bit of a diva.Dad.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.350
You really don'’t
have to do this.

08:45.960 --> 08:46.917
Do what?

08:47.701 --> 08:49.224
Treat me like a kid.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.096
Ah.

08:52.270 --> 08:54.925
Sometimes life doesn'’t always
have to be fun,

08:55.578 --> 08:56.884
you know?

08:57.667 --> 08:58.668
Well, that'’s true.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.149
Very true.

09:04.108 --> 09:05.936
It doesn'’t stop us
from trying though.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.155
[chuckles]

09:09.766 --> 09:10.724
But you know what?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.248
You'’re right. [sighs]

09:14.815 --> 09:16.338
Sometimes life isn'’t fun.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.297
Like coming back here.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.388
Reminds us of Mom
all over again, doesn'’t it?

09:24.476 --> 09:25.913
And maybe

09:26.087 --> 09:29.351
even makes you worry
that that could happen again.

09:30.439 --> 09:31.832
But the good news is...

09:32.963 --> 09:33.964
I'’m not Mom.

09:35.009 --> 09:36.184
I'’m not sick.

09:37.402 --> 09:38.447
I'’m just...

09:39.317 --> 09:40.884
broken.

09:41.058 --> 09:42.059
[chuckling]

09:43.974 --> 09:46.673
And I can be fixed.

09:47.717 --> 09:48.718
Look at me.

09:50.198 --> 09:51.895
It'’s a very simple surgery.

09:53.157 --> 09:54.681
And I'’m gonna be fine.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.335
I promise.

09:59.163 --> 10:00.338
Okay.

10:00.512 --> 10:02.210
But you got to promise me
something.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.474
That you will not
hang around here.

10:07.215 --> 10:09.130
That you will get out there

10:10.044 --> 10:11.523
and have some fun.

10:15.571 --> 10:16.920
I mean, you got to admit,

10:18.530 --> 10:20.707
one day it'’s gonna
make a hell of a story.

10:21.708 --> 10:22.883
What?

10:23.057 --> 10:24.145
Living in New York?

10:24.319 --> 10:25.363
[chuckles]

10:26.060 --> 10:27.322
Being a kid.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.021
[chuckles]

10:34.024 --> 10:36.418
[Veta, through TV] You and I
may take a little ride later.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.507
[Elwood, through TV]
Oh, I'’d like that.

10:38.681 --> 10:41.031
It'’s certainly
been a long time
since we'’ve been for a drive.

10:41.205 --> 10:43.381
You'’re very sweet
and thoughtful, Veta.

10:43.555 --> 10:45.993
[Veta] Don'’t forget
to wait for me, Elwood.
I'’ll be right back.

10:48.256 --> 10:51.215
[Elwood] All right, well, make
yourself comfortable, Harvey.

10:51.389 --> 10:52.434
[loud thump]

10:53.348 --> 10:55.742
[Elwood] There. All right?

10:57.265 --> 10:58.701
Veta wants to talk to us.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.485
[TV continues, indistinct]

11:34.171 --> 11:36.130
[door creaks]

11:44.138 --> 11:45.313
[hatch shuts]

12:37.278 --> 12:40.237
[radio host] ...skateboarded
across Canada in 11 months,

12:40.411 --> 12:43.197
raising over $14 million
to fight heart disease.

12:43.371 --> 12:45.503
He covered over 5,000 miles...

13:19.537 --> 13:20.495
Hello?

13:20.669 --> 13:23.280
What? What? Can you--

13:23.454 --> 13:24.716
Oh, God.

13:29.678 --> 13:31.767
[butterfly] Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.813
[footsteps running]

13:33.987 --> 13:36.337
[butterfly] Not good.
Not good. Not good.

13:37.512 --> 13:40.210
Oh, and she'’s following,
she'’s following.

13:40.950 --> 13:41.777
Hey!

13:41.951 --> 13:42.909
[butterfly] Oh, God, no.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.128
No, no, no. No. Stay, stay!

13:45.302 --> 13:47.435
[Bea] Wait![butterfly panting] Oh, God.

13:47.609 --> 13:51.743
So many stairs.
So... many... stairs.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.837
[door opens, closes]

14:05.279 --> 14:06.628
[butterfly]
I think she followed me.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.064
[man upstairs] What do
you mean she followed you?

14:08.238 --> 14:09.936
When?[butterfly] Just now.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.329
[man upstairs]
What do you mean, "now"?

14:12.503 --> 14:16.986
Right now. Now now.
Because I think she--

14:17.160 --> 14:19.293
I think she saw me.[man upstairs]
What do you mean?

14:19.467 --> 14:21.208
[butterfly]
Right in the eyes. Boom!

14:21.382 --> 14:24.124
And then run, run, run. And
then stairs, stairs, stairs.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.343
But then she'’s there,
and she'’s coming.

14:26.517 --> 14:29.259
And she'’s bigger,
and she'’s faster.

14:29.433 --> 14:31.740
And I think she--[man upstairs] Shh, shh, shh.

14:35.483 --> 14:36.876
[gasps]

14:37.050 --> 14:38.051
Hello?

14:39.226 --> 14:40.444
[man upstairs] Please go away.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.231
I, um...

14:45.580 --> 14:48.104
I was just trying to say hello
to your little girl.

14:48.278 --> 14:50.454
[man upstairs] No little girl
here. Please go away, please!

14:52.152 --> 14:53.153
Okay.

14:59.420 --> 15:01.117
I just moved in downstairs...

15:03.641 --> 15:05.861
and I don'’t really
have anybody to talk to.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.558
[door opens]

15:07.732 --> 15:08.864
Who...

15:10.735 --> 15:13.173
Who is that?I'’m sorry, I was just--

15:13.347 --> 15:15.001
[neighbor] Oh, it'’s you.

15:15.175 --> 15:16.916
You'’d better
get back downstairs.

15:17.090 --> 15:18.700
It'’s too late to be up here!

15:18.874 --> 15:20.049
Yes, ma'’am.

15:55.171 --> 15:56.477
[Elwood, through TV] Harvey!

15:58.000 --> 15:59.045
Harvey?

16:11.361 --> 16:12.972
[patient] Hi!

16:13.755 --> 16:14.712
Hi.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.149
Those for me?

16:16.323 --> 16:18.542
Uh, no, actually.
They'’re for my dad.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.153
Just kidding.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.546
Oh! Want to play chess?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.332
TV'’s busted.

16:25.506 --> 16:26.637
I'’m sorry?

16:26.811 --> 16:29.553
It'’s okay. It'’s not your fault.

16:29.727 --> 16:31.468
That'’s why my mom got me chess.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.470
Checkers.

16:34.645 --> 16:35.646
What happened?

16:35.820 --> 16:37.387
I fell.

16:37.561 --> 16:39.041
I fall a lot.

16:39.215 --> 16:42.914
This time I broke my leg
and my...

16:43.089 --> 16:44.264
coxxyx?

16:44.438 --> 16:48.485
Cozzyx? No, uh, my cowzyx?

16:48.659 --> 16:50.096
Cozmokyx?

16:50.966 --> 16:53.055
You know, I just broke my butt.

16:53.229 --> 16:54.491
[chuckles]

16:54.665 --> 16:57.929
And your arm, too?
What'’d you fall from?

16:58.104 --> 17:00.236
Oh, separate incidentses.

17:00.410 --> 17:01.803
Got it.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.457
I'’m Benjamin, by the way.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.676
I'’m Bea.Cool!

17:05.850 --> 17:07.722
What does B stand for?

17:07.896 --> 17:11.334
Oh, nothing. My mom
just used to call me Bea.

17:11.508 --> 17:14.076
I like it. Just B.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.947
Well, it was really nice
to meet you.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.384
Nice to meet you, too.

17:17.558 --> 17:20.039
You know where to find me!

17:49.198 --> 17:50.199
Oh, hello.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.158
You have to stop.

17:52.332 --> 17:53.724
Never.

17:58.294 --> 18:02.037
[Bea singing along to "Better
Be Good to Me" over camcorder]

18:10.001 --> 18:11.655
[singing continues]

18:30.674 --> 18:31.806
[loud thump]

18:33.547 --> 18:35.853
[butterfly]
Oh, God. So many stairs!

18:36.027 --> 18:37.942
[footsteps running]

18:39.901 --> 18:41.685
[butterfly] We'’ve got to go.
We'’ve got to go right now.

18:41.859 --> 18:43.513
[man upstairs] I'’m not going
anywhere. I just poured some--

18:43.687 --> 18:45.124
[butterfly whispering]
It'’s him.

18:45.298 --> 18:47.517
[man upstairs] Oh, God.[door closes]

19:02.837 --> 19:04.795
[man upstairs]
Honestly, this is the last time
I'’m doing this.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.319
Never again.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.103
[butterfly]
I'’m sorry, how is it my fault?

19:08.277 --> 19:09.931
You leave the photos out,
he'’s gonna find them.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.498
[man upstairs] I didn'’t--
I said it wasn'’t your fault.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.587
[butterfly] I'’m not
even gonna listen to this.

19:13.761 --> 19:15.763
[man upstairs] I'’m sorry--[butterfly] I would
never have let him--

19:15.937 --> 19:17.765
No, because, number one,
he'’s too big.
He'’s just generally too big.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.506
And secondly, everything else!

19:19.680 --> 19:21.899
[man upstairs] He'’s gigantic.
How did he get up there?

19:22.073 --> 19:23.249
[butterfly]
Beautiful house.

19:23.423 --> 19:25.816
Oh! Imagine. One day.Second floor.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.601
[chattering]

19:27.775 --> 19:29.342
Okay, you go around there--
All right.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.518
Just go!You'’re so rude.

19:34.738 --> 19:37.350
[man upstairs straining]

19:38.264 --> 19:39.439
[grunts]

19:46.924 --> 19:48.404
[straining continues]

20:06.117 --> 20:07.293
[thuds]

20:08.642 --> 20:10.078
[panting]

20:17.041 --> 20:18.129
[gasps]

20:36.887 --> 20:38.019
[whispering] Blue!

20:40.239 --> 20:41.370
Blue?

20:44.547 --> 20:45.766
This is it.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.464
I swear to God,

20:48.638 --> 20:51.859
if you don'’t
answer me right now,

20:52.033 --> 20:54.253
disappearing
will be the least of--[toys squeaking]

21:04.567 --> 21:05.699
Hi.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.178
Well, lookee, lookee.

21:07.353 --> 21:10.486
[chuckles] Okay, okay.
I know how it looks.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.575
But the truth is,

21:12.749 --> 21:14.751
she loves me!

21:14.925 --> 21:16.231
We are doing great!

21:16.405 --> 21:19.713
Really?
I heard she cried for an hour.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.323
Oh, come on.

21:21.497 --> 21:23.586
An hour seems like a little bit
of an embellishment.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.763
Do you know how hard it is
to cry for an hour?

21:26.937 --> 21:28.504
Grab your stuff. We'’re leaving.

21:28.678 --> 21:30.027
No, no, no!

21:30.201 --> 21:32.291
You can'’t take me away.
This is the one.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.902
She is the perfect fit.
I promise.

21:35.076 --> 21:36.730
Did you talk to her?

21:36.904 --> 21:40.386
Well, no. It was hard to
with all the crying.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.605
Exactly.
That'’s not a good thing.

21:42.779 --> 21:45.260
Did she even see you?She was about to.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.915
She was about to?Absolutely!

21:48.089 --> 21:50.047
I can almost guarantee it.

21:50.874 --> 21:51.788
I think.

21:51.962 --> 21:53.529
What happened?

21:53.703 --> 21:56.880
Well, she was putting
that creepy doll to sleep.

21:57.054 --> 21:58.186
[shudders]

21:58.360 --> 22:00.710
She stopped. She looked up.

22:00.884 --> 22:02.364
She definitely felt something.

22:02.538 --> 22:05.454
So I slowly walked over to her.

22:05.628 --> 22:08.588
And as I got close, I...

22:10.416 --> 22:11.634
[stifles sneeze]

22:12.287 --> 22:13.636
Wait.I--

22:13.810 --> 22:15.421
What are you doing?[stifles sneeze]

22:15.595 --> 22:17.597
No, no, no.
No, don'’t do this.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.425
Hey. Don'’t do this, okay?

22:19.599 --> 22:21.209
[wheezing]Blue. Hey, hey.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.167
[gulps]I swear to God,
I will never speak to you again

22:23.342 --> 22:24.604
as long as I live
if you do this. Please.

22:24.778 --> 22:26.649
[sniffs, gasps]Do not do that.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.608
Please. No. No. No. No!

22:28.782 --> 22:31.219
No, no. No. No. No. No. No!

22:31.393 --> 22:32.873
[sneezes][man upstairs grunts]

22:33.047 --> 22:34.135
[gasps]

22:34.309 --> 22:36.355
[mechanical toys chittering]

22:40.228 --> 22:44.363
[toy voice 1] Let'’s play again![toy voice 2] Great. Yeah!

22:53.807 --> 22:55.504
[window squeaks]

22:59.813 --> 23:01.075
Hi.

23:01.945 --> 23:03.643
[body thuds]Oh, God.

23:05.688 --> 23:07.211
["'’Deed I Do"
playing on phonograph]

24:07.228 --> 24:09.491
Ooh, I wouldn'’t do that.[gasps]

24:10.753 --> 24:12.189
[man upstairs] What was that?

24:12.363 --> 24:14.627
Just changing the record!

24:14.801 --> 24:18.544
[scoffs] He just gets so cranky
when people touch his stuff.

24:18.718 --> 24:20.328
[man upstairs]
Don'’t touch anything!

24:20.502 --> 24:22.548
[chuckles] See?

24:22.722 --> 24:24.158
Who are you?

24:24.332 --> 24:27.901
[chuckles] What do you mean?
I'’m-- I'’m Blue!

24:28.641 --> 24:29.685
But you'’re purple.

24:30.947 --> 24:33.776
Oh! Yeah, well,
he was color-blind, so...

24:33.950 --> 24:34.864
Who was?

24:35.038 --> 24:36.997
Well, my kid! Remember?

24:37.171 --> 24:38.433
What?

24:38.607 --> 24:39.695
[butterfly]
Oh, for God'’s sake, Blue!

24:39.869 --> 24:42.089
Of course she doesn'’t remember.

24:42.263 --> 24:43.612
She thinks
you'’re gonna eat her.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.962
[sighs] Apologies about him.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.834
He'’s the most adorable
train wreck,

24:48.008 --> 24:49.749
but a train wreck nonetheless.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.098
Thank you!

24:51.272 --> 24:52.926
You'’re welcome.

24:53.100 --> 24:56.016
Now would you mind picking our
guest up off the floor, please?

24:57.670 --> 25:01.369
That'’s it. Big finger.

25:01.543 --> 25:03.937
Lovely. Well done, Blue.

25:04.111 --> 25:07.636
Now, let'’s start over,
shall we?
How do you like your tea?

25:09.508 --> 25:10.987
I don'’t drink tea.

25:11.161 --> 25:13.990
[man upstairs] What kind
of girl doesn'’t drink tea?

25:14.164 --> 25:16.689
Not helping! [chuckles]

25:16.863 --> 25:18.995
I'’m Blossom,
and you'’ve clearly met Blue.

25:19.169 --> 25:20.693
Me again.

25:20.867 --> 25:22.695
And that is--She knows who I am.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.175
We'’ve, uh--

25:25.349 --> 25:27.134
We'’ve met before.

25:27.308 --> 25:29.397
Been a while since you--

25:29.571 --> 25:31.617
since you been up here.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.097
Yeah, last time I saw you,
you were, uh...

25:35.534 --> 25:36.926
smaller.

25:38.232 --> 25:39.842
What is going on?

25:40.016 --> 25:41.452
Yeah, well, that'’s a perfectly
understandable question,

25:41.627 --> 25:42.453
given, um...

25:42.628 --> 25:44.238
and, uh...Hey!

25:44.412 --> 25:45.805
"Hey"?Yeah, hey.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.241
What, we'’re gonna
explain it all right here,

25:47.415 --> 25:49.025
in a neat little pink package?

25:49.199 --> 25:50.244
[Blossom]
We'’re supposed to try.

25:50.418 --> 25:51.332
Excuse me.

25:51.506 --> 25:53.639
Will you stop poking her?

25:53.813 --> 25:57.381
Sorry. Sorry.
This is just so exciting!

25:57.556 --> 25:59.949
What is?That you'’re back!

26:00.123 --> 26:02.691
Blue! That'’s enough.I mean...

26:06.434 --> 26:07.653
What is that?

26:09.872 --> 26:13.484
What part of "don'’t touch my
stuff" do you not understand?

26:14.660 --> 26:16.575
Come on! This was all
in alphabetical order!

26:16.749 --> 26:17.837
Did you say your...

26:18.011 --> 26:19.142
[man upstairs]
And color coordinated.

26:19.316 --> 26:22.581
...kid?Oh, yeah. His name is Jeremy.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.844
God!
Get to hear more about Jeremy!

26:25.018 --> 26:27.498
So that house
we were at tonight,

26:28.325 --> 26:29.849
that was Jeremy'’s?

26:30.023 --> 26:33.026
Oh, no. That was different.
That was a potential match.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.897
And one that could'’ve
been successful,

26:35.071 --> 26:36.856
if it wasn'’t for you know who.

26:37.030 --> 26:39.554
All right, you know what?
Do it yourself.

26:39.728 --> 26:41.295
Okay? I don'’t need this.

26:41.469 --> 26:43.514
I don'’t need any of this.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.908
Whew! [chuckles] Okay.

26:46.082 --> 26:48.215
This has been
quite a day for him.

26:48.389 --> 26:49.956
But you...

26:50.130 --> 26:51.871
I'’m sure you have questions.

26:52.959 --> 26:54.090
So, are there more of you?

26:54.264 --> 26:55.962
[man upstairs] Say no!

26:56.136 --> 26:58.791
Yes.Oh, yeah! Lots more!

26:58.965 --> 27:03.534
[chuckles] I mean, almost
every kid has one. Had one.

27:03.709 --> 27:04.753
Had what?

27:05.536 --> 27:06.581
A friend.

27:07.974 --> 27:10.629
An imaginary friend?

27:10.803 --> 27:13.632
IF. We say "IF."

27:13.806 --> 27:17.461
[chuckles] Get it?
Imaginary. Friend.

27:17.636 --> 27:21.640
But also like what IF?
Like, anything'’s possible!

27:21.814 --> 27:24.381
Ooh! Ouch! Okay,
let'’s-- let'’s not get ahead
of ourselves here.

27:24.555 --> 27:27.384
Her eyes look like they might
melt out of her head.

27:27.558 --> 27:28.777
So...

27:29.648 --> 27:30.997
what was happening tonight?

27:31.171 --> 27:34.653
Oh, that was a placement
attempt with a new kid.

27:34.827 --> 27:37.090
We'’ve started
a fledgling little operation.

27:37.264 --> 27:39.135
[man upstairs] Ugh! "We"?

27:39.309 --> 27:41.442
He.What kind of operation?

27:41.616 --> 27:46.055
Sort of a matchmaking agency.
To help IFs find new kids.

27:46.229 --> 27:47.883
New kids?

27:48.667 --> 27:49.755
But what happened to your kid?

27:49.929 --> 27:53.106
Oh. He grew up.

27:53.280 --> 27:55.282
He doesn'’t need me anymore.[Bea] He doesn'’t?

27:56.631 --> 27:57.676
That'’s so sad.

27:57.850 --> 28:00.766
Eh, more like terrifying.
[laughs]

28:00.940 --> 28:02.985
Woo. [chuckles]Oh, no.

28:03.159 --> 28:06.249
Because
if he doesn'’t need me...

28:06.423 --> 28:07.555
Blue....he can'’t see me.

28:07.729 --> 28:08.948
Blue, over here.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.690
And if he can'’t see me...Look at me.

28:11.864 --> 28:14.257
...then all that'’s left is

28:14.431 --> 28:16.085
to disappear!

28:16.259 --> 28:17.434
[Blossom] Blue.[crying]

28:17.608 --> 28:18.914
Happy place! Happy place!

28:19.088 --> 28:21.395
[sobbing]
Coffee and croissants.

28:21.569 --> 28:22.831
Coffee and croissants.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.659
Good, good.[Blue] Coffee and croissants.

28:24.833 --> 28:26.269
Coffee and croissants.[Blossom] Okay.

28:26.443 --> 28:28.750
Coffee and croissants.This has all been a lot.

28:28.924 --> 28:31.231
Yes! Yes, it is...

28:31.884 --> 28:33.668
a lot.

28:33.842 --> 28:35.496
For everyone. I think
we should call it a night.

28:35.670 --> 28:36.845
I think she'’s doing
quite well actually.

28:37.019 --> 28:38.891
Thank you.[Blossom] You'’re welcome.

28:39.065 --> 28:42.111
Well, I think it'’s all too
much. Not to mention too late.

28:42.285 --> 28:43.591
And I don'’t think any of us

28:43.765 --> 28:45.462
want to be on
the wrong side of that door

28:45.636 --> 28:47.029
when that creepy witch
comes out.

28:48.335 --> 28:49.728
You should go.

28:49.902 --> 28:52.078
Aw, come on, Cal,
she'’s just a kid.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.341
I'’m not a kid.

28:56.430 --> 28:57.823
Well, that'’s that.

29:03.002 --> 29:04.264
Good night.

29:09.660 --> 29:10.836
Good night.

29:14.883 --> 29:16.102
[gasps]

29:29.376 --> 29:32.379
Oh! Oh, gosh,
you gave me a fright. [chuckles]

29:32.553 --> 29:34.076
Good morning.Good morning.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.991
Ah, you'’re off.

29:36.165 --> 29:37.514
I made pancakes.

29:41.344 --> 29:44.347
Oh, God. They seem
to be stuck to the pan.

29:44.521 --> 29:48.221
Um, I have some cereal
or some grapefruit.

29:48.395 --> 29:50.527
I'’m not that hungry.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.660
Well, you'’ll let me know
if you need anything.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.575
I will.Good.

29:59.362 --> 30:00.581
Oh, God.

30:01.974 --> 30:03.236
[sighs]

30:03.410 --> 30:05.281
[chattering]

30:56.028 --> 30:57.507
Is there any food?

30:57.681 --> 30:58.857
Of course.

30:59.031 --> 31:01.381
What do you feel like?
Real food?

31:01.555 --> 31:03.644
Or junk food? Yeah.

31:03.818 --> 31:06.952
There'’s a vending machine
down the hall and to the right.

31:14.524 --> 31:15.699
Oh!

31:39.506 --> 31:41.203
[bell dings]

31:43.075 --> 31:44.206
[elevator door opens]

31:48.428 --> 31:49.690
[muffled sneeze]

32:23.985 --> 32:27.554
Oh! Fancy seeing you here.

32:27.728 --> 32:30.122
[whispering] What are you
doing? Get out of there!

32:30.296 --> 32:33.777
I would love to,
but I cannot feel my legs.

32:34.517 --> 32:35.866
Oh, my God.

32:36.041 --> 32:38.739
Okay, give me your hand.[Blue giggles]

32:38.913 --> 32:40.871
Give me your hand. Your hand.
Give me your hand.

32:41.046 --> 32:42.873
Come on. Okay, come on.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.311
[grunts] Come on.[laughs] No, don'’t.

32:45.485 --> 32:48.575
Come on, stand up.Okay, wait, wait. Ow, ow, ow!

32:49.837 --> 32:51.317
Okay.

32:51.491 --> 32:53.014
You are strong!

32:53.623 --> 32:54.711
Whoa!

32:55.451 --> 32:56.670
[Blue shouts]

32:56.844 --> 32:58.106
[grunts]

32:58.280 --> 32:59.368
[wheezes, laughs]

32:59.542 --> 33:01.762
Can we do it again?Okay, get up.

33:01.936 --> 33:04.939
Get up, get up.[Blue giggling]

33:06.027 --> 33:07.681
Is this a hotel?

33:07.855 --> 33:10.466
What are you doing here?What are you doing here?

33:10.640 --> 33:12.294
I'’m visiting my dad!

33:12.468 --> 33:14.818
Oh, yeah!
Your dad has a broken heart?

33:14.993 --> 33:16.820
That must be scary.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.822
What? No, it'’s not.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.521
What are you doing here? I
cannot be seen talking to you.

33:21.695 --> 33:23.436
Ooh, why not?

33:23.610 --> 33:27.092
Because there'’s real people
here. I'’m gonna look crazy!

33:27.266 --> 33:30.834
[chuckles] Come on.
You'’re just a kid.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.358
[Benjamin] Hi!

33:38.538 --> 33:39.843
Who are you talking to?

33:42.803 --> 33:47.460
Okay... Oh... Whew! [groans]

33:47.634 --> 33:49.331
Open up!All right.

33:52.421 --> 33:54.902
Open up! I have your...

33:55.729 --> 33:56.817
thing.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.734
What are you anyway?An IF.

34:00.908 --> 34:03.606
I know that. But what?

34:06.696 --> 34:07.915
I don'’t know.

34:09.221 --> 34:11.832
Finally!Oh. It'’s you.

34:12.006 --> 34:13.921
Hello!I want it to stop.

34:14.095 --> 34:16.141
Oh, that'’s awful!
I'’ll make tea.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.056
I think she was pretty clear
she doesn'’t--

34:18.230 --> 34:19.144
Whatever.

34:19.318 --> 34:20.928
Make what stop?

34:21.102 --> 34:23.539
All of it. I don'’t need this.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.324
Well, I don'’t know
what to tell you,

34:25.498 --> 34:27.021
but that'’s not how this works.

34:27.195 --> 34:29.545
That'’s not how what works?
What is happening to me?

34:29.719 --> 34:31.765
You are the chosen one.Nope! Nope.

34:31.939 --> 34:33.549
Let'’s not give her a complex.

34:33.723 --> 34:35.334
She'’s already enough
of a spark plug as it is.

34:35.508 --> 34:36.987
Chosen for what?

34:37.162 --> 34:39.251
This whole thing is a curse.Now you'’re getting it.

34:39.425 --> 34:41.731
No, no, no!
You could do so much good.

34:41.905 --> 34:43.559
You could save all of us!

34:43.733 --> 34:44.691
All of who?

34:45.431 --> 34:46.823
And don'’t say IFs.

34:46.997 --> 34:49.609
[squeaking]

34:55.963 --> 34:57.007
Um...

34:58.313 --> 34:59.532
You should probably
let him say it

34:59.706 --> 35:01.751
or I think his head
may actually explode.

35:04.014 --> 35:05.929
[choking]Fine.

35:06.104 --> 35:12.762
I-I-I-I-I-I-F-F-F-F-Fs.

35:14.503 --> 35:15.678
Thank you.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.245
How can I help them?

35:17.419 --> 35:19.987
You can'’t.Of course she can.

35:21.031 --> 35:22.642
Look, there'’s nothing
we want more

35:22.816 --> 35:25.253
than to be with our own kids.

35:25.427 --> 35:26.472
But our kids...

35:27.342 --> 35:29.301
they'’ve forgotten about us.

35:29.475 --> 35:31.955
So we need new ones.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.697
You can help us find them.

35:34.871 --> 35:37.047
Like I always say:

35:37.222 --> 35:39.006
"Better to have a new kid

35:39.180 --> 35:42.140
than not to-- not to have a--
one-- a kid."

35:42.314 --> 35:44.142
He'’s never said that.

35:44.316 --> 35:47.014
[Blue sighs]
Well, thought it.

35:49.364 --> 35:53.455
So, I help you place them
with new kids,

35:53.629 --> 35:54.935
and that'’s it?

35:56.154 --> 35:58.330
Everything goes back to normal?

35:58.504 --> 36:00.549
Careful what you wish for.

36:12.257 --> 36:15.085
Then I want to meet them.Who?

36:15.260 --> 36:17.784
All the IFs you'’ve been trying
to match with them.

36:17.958 --> 36:18.915
That'’s impossible.

36:19.089 --> 36:21.657
Why?Because... [laughs]

36:21.831 --> 36:23.398
...I can'’t be seen
to take you to--

36:23.572 --> 36:24.573
Where?

36:26.836 --> 36:27.924
Nowhere.

36:28.795 --> 36:29.926
You need help.

36:31.580 --> 36:34.148
You have no idea
how true that statement is.

36:34.322 --> 36:36.194
But not in the way
that you'’re thinking.

36:38.065 --> 36:39.893
After last night,
you clearly don'’t know

36:40.067 --> 36:41.764
how to make this whole
placement thing work.

36:41.938 --> 36:43.853
[groans] Really?

36:44.027 --> 36:45.203
I can help you.

36:46.639 --> 36:47.727
How?

36:50.512 --> 36:52.079
'’Cause I'’m a kid.

36:54.821 --> 36:55.865
Well...

36:57.302 --> 36:58.694
that'’s that.

37:05.919 --> 37:07.094
[Bea] Where are we going?

37:07.268 --> 37:09.401
To get help.From who?

37:09.575 --> 37:12.186
From somebody more qualified.

37:12.360 --> 37:14.841
'’Cause this is way above
my pay grade.

37:22.240 --> 37:24.720
I think it'’s really nice
of you, by the way.

37:24.894 --> 37:26.200
What is?

37:26.374 --> 37:28.507
That you'’re
helping them all like this.

37:28.681 --> 37:31.292
Oh, I don'’t have a choice,
actually.

37:31.466 --> 37:33.163
They never leave.

37:36.558 --> 37:38.952
How long have you
been able to see them?

37:39.126 --> 37:41.563
Oh, as long as I can remember.

37:42.912 --> 37:44.305
Where do they live?

37:44.479 --> 37:47.308
Well, "live,"
I think that'’s a relative term,

37:47.482 --> 37:49.832
but normally anywhere kids are,
or have been.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.532
Is it...

37:54.359 --> 37:55.795
magical?

37:55.969 --> 37:58.058
Hmm? What?Where we'’re going.

38:00.408 --> 38:01.496
Used to be.

38:02.628 --> 38:03.716
This is us.

38:16.163 --> 38:17.730
Wait, I'’ve been here before.

38:17.904 --> 38:19.732
Really?

38:19.906 --> 38:21.951
Yeah, my mom took me here once.

38:22.125 --> 38:24.040
All coming back to you, is it?

38:27.870 --> 38:28.958
Wait.

38:31.570 --> 38:32.788
IFs live here?

38:34.137 --> 38:35.269
Hope so.

38:35.922 --> 38:37.489
But it'’s locked.

38:39.491 --> 38:41.667
I'’m gonna give you a minute
to think about that one.

38:41.841 --> 38:44.191
Stay here. I'’m gonna slip
around back, grab us a key.

38:44.365 --> 38:46.106
You'’re leaving me alone?

38:46.280 --> 38:47.934
You'’re never really alone!

38:48.108 --> 38:50.502
Thought that was obvious
by now.

39:36.635 --> 39:38.114
[groans]

39:39.115 --> 39:40.813
You sure you want to do this?

39:40.987 --> 39:42.728
Yeah.

39:42.902 --> 39:45.687
Because there'’s no telling
who'’s behind that door today.

39:46.601 --> 39:48.255
Are any of them scary?

39:48.429 --> 39:49.474
Worse.

39:50.344 --> 39:51.432
Desperate.

39:52.302 --> 39:54.957
Ah, Vicki. How are you?

39:55.131 --> 39:57.395
Is that a new perfume?
It smells, um--

39:57.569 --> 39:59.571
Okay. Boundaries, of course.

39:59.745 --> 40:03.618
Here to see Il Capitano.
Yeah, the ol'’ spirit bear.

40:03.792 --> 40:05.011
Okay. [knocks]

40:06.142 --> 40:08.188
Look alive.

40:08.362 --> 40:10.233
[Judge Judy, through TV]
Was your daughter living
in her mother'’s house?

40:10.408 --> 40:11.974
That'’s loud.

40:12.148 --> 40:15.021
[Judge Judy]
And you were using
her utilities accounts.

40:15.195 --> 40:18.851
Your husband says that your
daughter was not living in--

40:19.025 --> 40:21.331
[news program intro on TV]

40:21.506 --> 40:24.465
[through TV] I'’m Kurt Loder
with an MTV news brief.

40:24.639 --> 40:26.206
[Cal] Hey!

40:26.380 --> 40:27.990
Let'’s go! Come on.

40:28.164 --> 40:29.514
[crashes][Cal] Oh!

40:30.993 --> 40:32.299
Why is this here?

40:33.692 --> 40:34.693
Hi, Todd!

40:36.521 --> 40:37.913
[squeaks]

40:39.611 --> 40:41.743
[therapist] Okay.
Let'’s start like we always do.

40:41.917 --> 40:43.658
Big breath in. [inhales]

40:43.832 --> 40:44.746
And out.

40:44.920 --> 40:45.965
[exhales]

40:46.139 --> 40:47.662
And in. [inhales]

40:47.836 --> 40:49.272
And out. [exhales]

40:49.447 --> 40:50.839
Beautiful.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.058
Who'’d like to start?

40:52.232 --> 40:54.234
[sobbing] I'’ve been...

40:54.408 --> 40:57.063
Last week
I was feeling pretty good,

40:57.237 --> 40:59.413
and then this week,
I don'’t know what happened!

40:59.587 --> 41:02.372
It'’s okay.I just started falling apart!

41:02.547 --> 41:04.026
Oh, here we go.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.202
[chuckles] I mean, cue
the violins. Am I right, Terry?

41:06.376 --> 41:09.858
Oh, come on.Ted, you know she'’s a viola!

41:10.032 --> 41:12.339
Well, that'’s not nice. That
doesn'’t make anyone feel good.

41:12.513 --> 41:13.645
Guys, guys.

41:13.819 --> 41:15.298
We have to move
through this narrative

41:15.473 --> 41:17.910
that our kids
choose to forget about us.

41:18.084 --> 41:21.174
They all go through something
that makes them forget.

41:21.348 --> 41:23.916
[sobbing] Oh, I wish I could
see him one more time.

41:24.090 --> 41:26.701
I wish I could just tell him
I'’m right here!

41:26.875 --> 41:29.791
I'’ve always been right here!

41:29.965 --> 41:32.881
Hey, hey, hey, whoa!
Not the cape.

41:33.055 --> 41:34.709
That is toxic.

41:34.883 --> 41:36.668
It'’s okay. We'’ll get someone
to clean that up.

41:36.842 --> 41:39.018
Listen, Doc.
I'’m payin'’ good cash,

41:39.192 --> 41:41.368
and this slime ball'’s
takin'’ up all the time.

41:41.542 --> 41:42.935
[IF] Doc, I got a question.

41:43.109 --> 41:45.807
Is it possible that kids
are just the worst?

41:45.981 --> 41:47.853
Oh, my God. Is that a kid?

41:48.027 --> 41:49.942
What'’s that?Oh, my God!

41:51.378 --> 41:53.641
Uh, what does
the skin look like?

41:55.077 --> 41:56.775
What does it feel like?

41:56.949 --> 41:59.734
Is there light
reflecting off the skin?

42:00.822 --> 42:02.824
Psst!Or is there none? Yeah.

42:02.998 --> 42:05.174
[whispering] Hey.Uh, Judith, you can cover up.

42:05.348 --> 42:06.611
Let'’s take five, everybody.

42:06.785 --> 42:08.743
Hey, Cal. You still owe me
twenty bucks

42:08.917 --> 42:10.397
from that foam party.That'’s right, yeah.

42:10.571 --> 42:12.834
We said we were never gonna
talk about that with words.

42:13.008 --> 42:14.183
Listen, I need
to find somebody,

42:14.357 --> 42:17.317
but I need to do it
on the quiet, okay?

42:17.491 --> 42:19.319
Oh, hi.Hi.

42:20.276 --> 42:21.451
Hi.

42:22.409 --> 42:24.411
Is that...No.

42:25.673 --> 42:26.761
Yes.Oh, boy.

42:26.935 --> 42:29.155
I need to see Lewis.
Where is Lewis?

42:29.329 --> 42:32.071
Yeah, sure. I think I saw him
heading down towards the pool.

42:32.245 --> 42:34.290
The pool, okay. Go, go, go.

42:34.464 --> 42:38.207
Yeah, yeah, sure. No worries.
Good luck! [chuckles]

42:38.381 --> 42:40.819
Aw, come on, guys.
We'’ve been through this before.

42:41.689 --> 42:44.562
It'’s not snacks. It'’s art.

42:46.346 --> 42:47.652
How'’s that feel?

42:47.826 --> 42:49.871
Regret starting
to burble up in your throat?

42:50.045 --> 42:51.873
Hey, Cal!Good God, Cos!

42:52.047 --> 42:53.701
Who'’s the girl?What is wrong with you?

42:53.875 --> 42:55.442
Hey, Tater Tot.She'’s a friend!

42:55.616 --> 42:57.444
What kind of friend?Hey!

42:57.618 --> 42:59.577
You'’re stronger than you look.Hey!

42:59.751 --> 43:00.839
You know I'’ll find out.Yeah?

43:01.013 --> 43:01.753
[chuckles]

43:01.927 --> 43:03.145
Whatever, man.Whoa!

43:04.146 --> 43:06.192
Cloak-and-dagger!

43:06.366 --> 43:08.716
[scoffs] Starting to see
why I live alone.

43:09.804 --> 43:10.849
Keith!

43:12.198 --> 43:15.331
What kind of a kid
creates an invisible IF?

43:15.505 --> 43:17.507
Was he laying down?Who knows?

43:19.031 --> 43:24.297
[instructor] Down and up,
and down and up,
and down and up,

43:24.471 --> 43:27.169
and down and up, and down.

43:27.343 --> 43:29.215
Really bend those knees,
ladies!

43:29.389 --> 43:31.217
[Gummy Bear] Am I looking red?Yes.

43:36.265 --> 43:37.789
Oh, thank God!

43:47.102 --> 43:48.582
Come on.

[birds singing]

43:58.461 --> 44:01.856
Lewis? I have someone
I'’d like you to meet.

44:02.509 --> 44:04.772
Hello, Elizabeth.

44:04.946 --> 44:06.992
It'’s very nice to meet you.

44:07.166 --> 44:08.646
Thank you.

44:08.820 --> 44:11.953
So, did he give you
the grand tour?

44:12.127 --> 44:13.259
Kind of.

44:13.433 --> 44:14.521
And what'’d you think?

44:17.350 --> 44:19.613
Not quite what I expected.

44:19.787 --> 44:21.180
Uh-huh.

44:21.354 --> 44:23.138
She wants to help
with the placements.

44:23.312 --> 44:25.706
Uh-huh.

44:25.880 --> 44:28.100
Lewis here is 93.
He started this place.

44:28.274 --> 44:29.841
He can teach you everything
you need to know.

44:30.015 --> 44:31.407
Isn'’t that right, Lewis?[Lewis] Calvin.

44:31.581 --> 44:35.237
[chuckles] You know,
he wasn'’t always like this.

44:35.411 --> 44:38.066
Oh, no?Nah.

44:38.240 --> 44:42.288
Old Calvin here used to be
a clown. He tell you that?

44:42.462 --> 44:43.855
No.

44:44.029 --> 44:46.074
[Lewis chuckles] That'’s right.

44:46.248 --> 44:51.079
Before all this, his only job
in life was to make you smile.

44:53.778 --> 44:55.910
Well, not anymore.

44:56.084 --> 44:57.651
All right. [claps]

44:57.825 --> 44:59.435
You guys seem to have this
under control.

44:59.609 --> 45:00.915
He'’ll show you the ropes.

45:01.089 --> 45:03.439
Probably have you wax a car
or something.

45:03.613 --> 45:07.879
You know, if he'’s not gonna
give you the grand tour,

45:08.053 --> 45:10.272
why don'’t you give it to him?

45:10.446 --> 45:12.057
I'’m sorry, what?

45:12.231 --> 45:15.669
This place can be
anything you want it to be.

45:16.670 --> 45:21.109
All you need
is a little imagination.

45:31.337 --> 45:33.992
No. No.

45:34.166 --> 45:36.081
No, no, no. Don'’t do this.

45:36.255 --> 45:40.259
Show us how it looked
in that head of yours.

No.

45:58.930 --> 46:00.627
[panting]

46:05.937 --> 46:07.503
What happened?

46:07.677 --> 46:09.201
Nothing, Matt.
Let'’s just get you back
inside here.

46:09.375 --> 46:11.420
There you go.[Blue giggles]

46:11.594 --> 46:14.032
What are you doing, Sneezy?
Help me out here.

46:14.206 --> 46:15.424
Something'’s happening!

46:15.598 --> 46:17.122
Nothing is happening!

46:18.427 --> 46:19.602
[Blue giggles]

46:19.777 --> 46:20.908
Yeah!

46:21.082 --> 46:23.650
Get inside.No, no, no! I want to see!

46:23.824 --> 46:25.521
No, I want to see,
I want to see!

46:25.695 --> 46:29.047
[Cal grunting] Get in![laughing]

46:31.049 --> 46:32.572
Oh, wow![bell dings]

46:36.184 --> 46:37.969
[sniffs] Mmm.

46:41.711 --> 46:42.974

Oh, my gosh! Is this the pool?

Oh, wow, nice.Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

Sorry.

48:42.354 --> 48:43.659
Cal?

48:44.965 --> 48:45.923
Cal?

48:46.097 --> 48:48.316
Whoa! Are you all right?

48:48.490 --> 48:50.362
Whoa! Hey, where'’d you
come from?

48:51.189 --> 48:53.278
No, no, no, not the fruit!

You were supposed
to be here five minutes ago!

49:21.523 --> 49:22.960
You'’re on!What do you mean?

49:23.134 --> 49:24.918
Come on, get out there!

49:55.296 --> 49:56.602

50:10.224 --> 50:11.791
Thanks.

50:17.492 --> 50:18.928

Ooh! You'’re back.Is he all right?

Oh, that was fun![panting]

You look a mess.Your tush okay, hon?

51:07.760 --> 51:11.068
Did you say G-4?
I have bingo!

51:11.242 --> 51:13.461
Well, that was
the weirdest job interview

I'’ve ever been a part of.

51:14.897 --> 51:16.073

51:16.247 --> 51:18.684
Oh, good!
Glad you'’re having fun.

51:18.858 --> 51:20.207
So does this make us partners?

You know what no one tells you
about hospitals?

52:07.124 --> 52:09.778
There is nothing good to read.

52:11.432 --> 52:12.825
How'’s your story coming?

52:13.869 --> 52:15.523
Oh, I don'’t have time for that.

52:15.697 --> 52:17.134
I got a job.

52:17.308 --> 52:19.310
Okay.

52:19.484 --> 52:21.442
I assume I'’m allowed
to ask no questions.

52:22.313 --> 52:24.445
Nope.[Dad] As you were.

52:25.707 --> 52:27.231

Hi!

52:37.371 --> 52:39.460
Whoa.

52:39.634 --> 52:41.723
You got supersonic hearing
or something?

52:41.897 --> 52:43.290
Nope.
I was just waiting for you.

52:43.464 --> 52:44.552
Oh.

52:46.598 --> 52:48.469
TV'’s still busted.

52:48.643 --> 52:50.732
They should really
get that fixed.

52:50.906 --> 52:53.779
Honestly? I think my mom
has something to do with it.

52:54.475 --> 52:56.173
Your mom?Yeah.

52:56.347 --> 52:59.524
She says that screens
turn my brain into mush.

53:00.264 --> 53:02.179
What if she broke it?

53:03.092 --> 53:05.138
Guess what. I got a job.

53:05.312 --> 53:08.489
Wow.
Like, at an ice cream store?

53:08.663 --> 53:11.275
More like a matchmaking agency.

53:11.449 --> 53:15.104
Well, whatever it is, I'’m sure
you'’re great at it. Good luck!

53:15.279 --> 53:16.845
Thank you.

53:21.589 --> 53:23.809
Hey.Yeah?

53:23.983 --> 53:26.290
Have you ever had
an imaginary friend?

53:27.595 --> 53:28.640
Nope.

53:29.293 --> 53:30.642
Want one?

53:31.730 --> 53:33.166
Sure!

53:36.691 --> 53:39.738
Well, he'’s about eight or nine,
so I think
we prioritize by hobby.

53:39.912 --> 53:41.740
Oh, boy.See if anybody
has any experience

53:41.914 --> 53:43.307
in magic or fantasy.Good luck, guys.

53:43.481 --> 53:46.005
Hmm, fantasy'’s a bit
of a Pandora'’s box.

53:46.179 --> 53:47.398
Maybe their person
liked superheroes.

53:47.572 --> 53:49.095
Yeah. He does.

53:49.269 --> 53:51.489
Or art.Yup. Love art.

53:51.663 --> 53:53.317
Or TV.I'’m not gonna ask you again.

53:53.491 --> 53:55.275
Put some pants on.
You'’re freaking everyone out.

53:55.449 --> 53:56.798
[chuckling] Pants.

53:56.972 --> 53:58.844
How are we feeling?[Bea] I feel good.

53:59.018 --> 54:00.628
You feel good?Yeah.

54:00.802 --> 54:03.805
As good as can be expected.
It'’s your show. Here we go.

54:14.163 --> 54:15.513
You can send them in.

54:16.601 --> 54:18.559
Okay, so I just--

54:18.733 --> 54:20.387
just put myself right here?
Got it right, okay.

54:20.561 --> 54:22.389
Perfect. Hi.[all] Hi.

54:22.563 --> 54:25.174
[giggling] Oh, hi! My gosh!

54:25.349 --> 54:27.176
This is just so exciting!

54:27.351 --> 54:28.569
So, what'’s your name?

54:28.743 --> 54:30.397
[chuckles] My name is Ally.

54:30.571 --> 54:32.007
Sunny.

54:32.181 --> 54:34.358
Andromedus the Third, son of--

54:34.532 --> 54:35.533
Steven.

54:35.707 --> 54:37.056
Pop.

54:37.230 --> 54:40.712
Because, well, sometimes,
when I get nervous I--

54:40.886 --> 54:42.148
Oh, dear God.

54:42.714 --> 54:44.150
[chuckles]

54:44.324 --> 54:46.108
Nothing to be nervous about.
You'’re doing great.

54:46.283 --> 54:48.807
[gasps] She'’s so sweet.

54:48.981 --> 54:52.376
My little girl'’s name
was Tabitha.

54:52.550 --> 54:56.771
Uh, she named me Uni, because--
because... [laughs]

54:56.945 --> 54:58.730
...because I'’m a unicorn!

54:58.904 --> 55:01.559
[laughing] Sorry.
Oh, I'’m so nervous!

55:01.733 --> 55:03.038
And where are you from?

55:03.212 --> 55:05.214
Originally? Philadelphia.

55:05.389 --> 55:06.738
DeKalb. Illinois.

55:06.912 --> 55:08.348
Spokane.

55:08.522 --> 55:10.785
New Jersey.
Save your comments, please.

55:10.959 --> 55:13.614
Uh, mostly RadioShack.

55:13.788 --> 55:15.529
Let'’s see, we moved in '’83.

55:15.703 --> 55:18.924
Oh, no! '’84?
Yeah, that was rough.

55:19.098 --> 55:20.578
I mean, rough.

55:20.752 --> 55:22.884
Poughkeepsie? Come on, Dad.

55:23.058 --> 55:26.235
[chuckles]
Might as well have moved us
to the moon, am I right?

55:26.410 --> 55:28.716
[laughing][chuckles]

55:28.890 --> 55:30.109
It'’s not funny.

55:30.283 --> 55:31.284
[mouthing words]

55:31.458 --> 55:33.765
[triumphant music playing]

56:01.358 --> 56:02.359
Are you ready?

56:03.142 --> 56:04.273
For what?

56:05.318 --> 56:06.580
Anything.

56:06.754 --> 56:10.323
We used to put on shows
every day.

56:10.497 --> 56:12.499
Sometimes multiple shows!
Look--

56:12.673 --> 56:13.935
They kept building me and--

56:14.109 --> 56:16.068
and rebuilding me.
You know what I mean?

56:16.242 --> 56:18.766
But we never got lasers
to shoot out of my eyes!

56:18.940 --> 56:21.552
I'’m not gonna lie and say
the schedule wasn'’t brutal,

56:21.726 --> 56:22.727
because it was.

56:22.901 --> 56:24.119
But at the end of the day,

56:24.293 --> 56:28.254
to hear the roar of that crowd.
God!

56:28.428 --> 56:30.299
The uncles... [chuckles]

56:30.474 --> 56:32.040
...the uncles were the best.

56:32.214 --> 56:35.304
Okay, I got a whole bunch
of friends here.

56:35.479 --> 56:37.132
You just let me know
which one you can see.

56:37.306 --> 56:38.351
Sure.

56:39.265 --> 56:40.309
[chuckles]

56:40.484 --> 56:43.443
All right,
can you see this guy?

56:43.617 --> 56:45.489
[scatting]

56:49.275 --> 56:50.319
Ta-da!

56:51.930 --> 56:52.887
Nope.

56:53.061 --> 56:54.106
Nothin'’?

56:54.280 --> 56:56.325
No problem.Who is this kid?

56:56.500 --> 56:57.936
Nothin'’?

56:58.110 --> 57:01.156
You know, the hardest part
for me was maybe bedtime.

57:01.330 --> 57:03.724
Look, Mom just
didn'’t get it. I mean...

57:03.898 --> 57:06.684
Okay, let me tell you
something about the dark, okay?

57:06.858 --> 57:10.514
All kids are scared
of the dark. All of them!

57:10.688 --> 57:13.168
Even if they don'’t admit it.
And why?

57:13.342 --> 57:16.563
'’Cause those night-lights
don'’t do anything! That'’s why.

57:16.737 --> 57:19.131
That'’s why.

57:19.305 --> 57:22.090
Like, sure, Mom, you got a job
to do. You'’re doing great.
But let me ask you something.

57:22.264 --> 57:23.918
You put this kid to bed,

57:24.092 --> 57:26.051
who'’s gonna watch over
Poughkeepsie?

57:26.225 --> 57:28.532
Can you see this guy?

57:28.706 --> 57:30.882
Okay. Here we go!

57:32.449 --> 57:33.711
Nope.What'’s that?

57:33.885 --> 57:35.582
[chuckling] Ask him again.

57:35.756 --> 57:36.975
Ask him again.

57:37.149 --> 57:38.237
Really?

57:38.411 --> 57:39.717
Nope.That'’s it. I got this.

57:39.891 --> 57:41.458
Whoa!No, I got this!

57:41.632 --> 57:43.851
And Mom said too much candy
isn'’t good for your tummy,

57:44.025 --> 57:45.070
but I said--

57:45.244 --> 57:46.506
[flatulence]Oh, my God.

57:46.680 --> 57:49.291
Wow. My eyes can taste it.

57:49.466 --> 57:50.815
I'’m so sorry.

57:50.989 --> 57:52.730
You don'’t taste that
in your eyeballs?

57:52.904 --> 57:54.166
I can find anyone.

57:54.340 --> 57:55.515
Anywhere![screams]

57:55.689 --> 57:57.517
Don'’t, don'’t! Okay, okay, okay.

57:57.691 --> 57:59.476
But where are you from?

57:59.650 --> 58:01.608
[chuckling] Like I would
ever tell you that.

58:01.782 --> 58:03.001
Like he would ever
tell you that.

58:03.175 --> 58:05.307
[Cal] All right,
thank you very much, sir.

58:05.482 --> 58:06.961
Pretty but dim.Uh, he'’s in my--

58:07.135 --> 58:08.049
He got in my mouth.

58:08.223 --> 58:09.703
Look, you seem like a nice kid,

58:09.877 --> 58:11.183
so I'’m just gonna
shoot straight.

58:11.357 --> 58:12.924
In the beginning, I thought,

58:13.098 --> 58:15.361
what if he created me
as some kind of metaphor?

58:15.535 --> 58:17.494
I mean, it'’s possible
that he could be

58:17.668 --> 58:20.409
like a legit genius, right?
Wrong.

58:20.584 --> 58:24.501
It was Arizona, and he was
just thirsty. And here we are!

58:27.678 --> 58:32.030
[whispering] Don'’t, uh,
don'’t look him in the eye.

58:32.204 --> 58:34.859
Which one?You know damn well which one.

58:35.033 --> 58:38.210
And I just want to say,
thanks for doing this.

58:38.384 --> 58:42.170
It really means
a whole lot to everybody! Oh!

58:42.344 --> 58:43.824
[retches]

58:43.998 --> 58:46.261
[Lewis chuckles][gags]

58:46.871 --> 58:48.046
Nope.

58:48.220 --> 58:49.917
I don'’t think he knows
what he wants.

58:50.091 --> 58:51.832
What the hell do you want?

58:52.790 --> 58:54.313
Who'’s next?

58:54.487 --> 58:55.836
[thuds]

58:56.010 --> 58:57.098
[Cal] Keith!

58:57.795 --> 58:59.231
No.I agree.

58:59.405 --> 59:00.798
Yeah, that one'’s
just confusing.

59:00.972 --> 59:02.190
Keith'’s the worst.

59:06.368 --> 59:10.198
Mmm. His favorite snack
was croissants.

59:10.372 --> 59:11.809
Which was kind of cheating.

59:11.983 --> 59:14.420
Because his parents owned
a bakery right downstairs.

59:14.594 --> 59:17.162
[chuckling]
So that was convenient!

59:17.336 --> 59:19.599
So we had a lot of croissants.

59:19.773 --> 59:22.428
And bread. Carbs. Lotta carbs.

59:22.602 --> 59:25.213
Not pasta.
Which is interesting.

59:25.387 --> 59:27.085
But everything else
they did make

59:27.259 --> 59:29.130
was a delicious smell-fest.

59:29.304 --> 59:30.654
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!No, no, no!

59:30.828 --> 59:32.264
Hey, hey, hey!

59:32.438 --> 59:35.789
Okay, you saw-- Okay,
you saw this! You see this!

59:35.963 --> 59:38.226
Because this is my life
in a nutshell, okay?

59:42.796 --> 59:43.667
Nope.

59:43.841 --> 59:46.060
[sneezes]

59:46.234 --> 59:47.322
[crashing]

59:48.585 --> 59:49.977
Any more?

59:52.893 --> 59:53.894
No.

59:54.765 --> 59:56.288
It didn'’t work.

59:57.985 --> 59:58.986
I'’m sorry.

59:59.160 --> 01:00:02.250
That'’s okay. I still have you!

01:00:05.079 --> 01:00:07.342
[seagulls squawking]

01:00:08.126 --> 01:00:09.780
Being excited is exhausting!

01:00:09.954 --> 01:00:11.738
Okay, let'’s get you to bed.

01:00:31.062 --> 01:00:33.281
So, how'’d it go?

01:00:35.196 --> 01:00:36.894
It didn'’t work.

01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:39.244
[chuckles] Well,

01:00:40.288 --> 01:00:42.639
maybe it just wasn'’t meant to.

01:00:44.118 --> 01:00:47.034
All this time
spent trying to find new kids,

01:00:48.514 --> 01:00:50.734
they stopped looking
for their old ones.

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:53.301
But their kids have grown up.

01:00:54.389 --> 01:00:55.826
They don'’t need them anymore.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.352
[chuckles] All kids
need their imaginary friends.

01:01:01.266 --> 01:01:03.877
Especially when they grow up.

01:01:05.009 --> 01:01:06.663
But they'’ve forgotten.

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:09.666
Nothing you love

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.668
can ever be forgotten.

01:01:12.843 --> 01:01:15.672
You can always go back.

01:01:16.455 --> 01:01:17.804
How?

01:01:17.978 --> 01:01:19.937
Memories.

01:01:20.111 --> 01:01:24.419
They live forever.
Right there in your heart.

01:01:24.593 --> 01:01:30.512
Sometimes you just need to
find a way to invite them out.

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:35.387
For me, it'’s the smell
of the sea breeze.

01:01:36.867 --> 01:01:40.609
Or the sound of footsteps
tapping on the boardwalk.

01:01:42.002 --> 01:01:43.264
After that,

01:01:44.265 --> 01:01:46.964
you just close your eyes,

01:01:47.138 --> 01:01:50.489
and it all comes rushing back.

["L-O-V-E" playing]

01:02:28.179 --> 01:02:29.528
Shall we?

01:02:29.702 --> 01:02:31.356
Thought you'’d never ask.

[Uni giggling]
Wait for me! Wait for me!

01:02:51.463 --> 01:02:53.160
[chuckles] Hey!

01:02:56.642 --> 01:02:57.861
Pretty good, huh?

01:02:58.731 --> 01:03:00.733
[gasps] I love it.

01:03:00.907 --> 01:03:02.953
Look at this.Oh, my gosh!

01:03:03.127 --> 01:03:04.650
Wow, is that a flower?It'’s so cute.

[chuckles, snorts]

01:03:06.521 --> 01:03:08.088
Ooh! Ooh, mine! Mine!
I want to try!

01:03:08.262 --> 01:03:10.351
[Blue] Thank you, my good sir.

01:03:10.525 --> 01:03:11.657
Look at this!

01:03:11.831 --> 01:03:13.485

Oh, those look great.

Whoa, whoa, whoa!

Lights out.

01:04:07.669 --> 01:04:10.411
You should get some rest.
You got a big day tomorrow.

01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:13.762
Why, what'’s happening tomorrow?

01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:16.678

Never.

[chuckles]

01:04:24.904 --> 01:04:27.951
[Grandmother] Because there
I was having my final swim

01:04:28.125 --> 01:04:29.604
before getting to the airport.

01:04:29.778 --> 01:04:31.606
Now, normally you just
go up like that, don'’t you?

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.521
You just go "Whump!"
and legs up.

01:04:33.695 --> 01:04:35.610
I could not do that,
because I had a broken leg.

01:04:36.263 --> 01:04:37.351
[Bea giggles]

01:04:37.525 --> 01:04:38.875
Now, do you want
some more of this?

01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:41.355
Because I didn'’t know
what flavor you like.

01:04:41.529 --> 01:04:43.792
So I just got everything.No, it was great.

01:04:44.837 --> 01:04:46.273
You did great.

01:04:47.318 --> 01:04:48.319
Good.

01:04:49.668 --> 01:04:50.712
Right.

01:04:52.758 --> 01:04:54.151
Grandma?

01:04:54.325 --> 01:04:56.022
Can I ask you a question?

01:04:56.805 --> 01:04:59.417
Of course. Anything.

01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:02.594
What did you want to be

01:05:03.595 --> 01:05:04.901
when you were a kid?

01:05:06.119 --> 01:05:07.425

[both laughing]

01:05:22.962 --> 01:05:26.270
I always dreamt
of being a dancer.

01:05:26.444 --> 01:05:27.575
Really?

Excuse me,
don'’t look so surprised.

01:05:29.273 --> 01:05:32.624
Your grandfather
thought I was quite fetching.

01:05:32.798 --> 01:05:34.365
So, he saw you dance?

01:05:34.539 --> 01:05:35.583
Of course!

01:05:35.757 --> 01:05:37.107
I'’ve got something here.

01:05:39.109 --> 01:05:41.763
Oh, yeah. Oh, my goodness.

01:05:45.724 --> 01:05:46.768
Oh.

01:05:48.901 --> 01:05:50.990
[sighs]
That'’s your grandmother.

01:05:54.341 --> 01:05:55.952
You'’re beautiful.

01:05:56.126 --> 01:05:57.214
Yeah, well, he thought so.

01:05:57.388 --> 01:05:59.042
[chuckles]

01:05:59.216 --> 01:06:01.696
Actually, I was
shaking in my boots that day.

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:04.047
Or in my slippers.

01:06:04.221 --> 01:06:05.570
You were?Yeah.

01:06:05.744 --> 01:06:08.573
I mean, it was the most
important day of my life

01:06:08.747 --> 01:06:10.053
because they only had--

01:06:10.227 --> 01:06:13.447
I think six schools
were chosen to perform

01:06:13.621 --> 01:06:17.843
across the river in just this
beautiful little theater.

01:06:18.017 --> 01:06:20.672
And I still remember

01:06:20.846 --> 01:06:24.023
the sound of the wood
on the floor creaking.

01:06:24.197 --> 01:06:27.418
And the music just tumbled
from the orchestra,

01:06:27.592 --> 01:06:28.941
just like a wave.

01:06:31.378 --> 01:06:35.643
And how the dust
caught the light as it fell.

01:06:35.817 --> 01:06:37.689
And it made me feel like

01:06:38.342 --> 01:06:39.952
I was in a dream.

01:06:46.437 --> 01:06:49.396
Oh, my dear girl, I grew up.

01:06:49.570 --> 01:06:50.789
Too tall.

01:06:51.616 --> 01:06:52.834
Too awkward.

01:06:54.619 --> 01:06:56.360
And too old.

01:06:56.534 --> 01:06:57.622
I mean, let'’s be honest,

01:06:57.796 --> 01:07:00.842
who wants to see
an old woman dance?

01:07:01.495 --> 01:07:02.801
Now,

01:07:02.975 --> 01:07:05.108
can I get you some dessert?

01:07:05.282 --> 01:07:08.285
I have some ice cream. Well,
I think I have some ice cream.

01:07:08.459 --> 01:07:10.678
If it doesn'’t have ice on top.

01:07:10.852 --> 01:07:14.334
Why does ice form
on the top of ice cream?

Wow. I am not ready for this.
I think I'’m gonna be sick.Oh!

01:13:15.042 --> 01:13:17.610
[Blue] What, you see him?He'’s on the move. Come on!

01:13:17.784 --> 01:13:19.438
[Blue] Where?[Cal] Let'’s go, go, go.
Double-time.

01:13:19.612 --> 01:13:22.746
Oh, I should'’ve worn a suit!

[mumbling]

01:13:32.016 --> 01:13:33.278

[Blue sighs]

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.849
Oh, boy.

01:13:40.241 --> 01:13:42.287
He looks...

01:13:43.375 --> 01:13:45.899
great! [laughs]

01:13:46.073 --> 01:13:48.249
Wow! Look at him!

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:50.338
So fit!

01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:53.167
He used to look,
well, more like me.

01:13:53.341 --> 01:13:55.039
Oh!

01:13:55.213 --> 01:13:57.520
Looks like he'’s done something
to his hair.

01:13:57.694 --> 01:13:59.435
I think that'’s sweat.

01:14:00.697 --> 01:14:03.308
I am so emotional!

01:14:03.482 --> 01:14:04.570
Now'’s our chance.

[elevator music plays]

01:14:13.361 --> 01:14:15.886
Okay. Got to go in there.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.105
Wait, what?

01:14:18.279 --> 01:14:19.977
I can'’t go in there alone.

01:14:21.979 --> 01:14:23.371
Then you go with him.

01:14:23.546 --> 01:14:25.461
Oh, no, I'’m afraid
that'’s not on the menu.

01:14:25.635 --> 01:14:26.592
Um, I wouldn'’t say
that public bathrooms
are my worst nightmare...

01:14:26.766 --> 01:14:28.333
Oh, please!

01:14:28.507 --> 01:14:29.856
...but they'’re
definitely up there
in the top one.

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:31.467

How is that possible,
you may ask."

Cal, am I disappearing?

01:16:00.164 --> 01:16:02.079
Pretty sure
that'’s not how this works.

I think I need to throw up.

I don'’t understand.
They were standing
right next to each other.

01:16:14.787 --> 01:16:17.311
Okay, yeah. I need to throw up.

01:16:17.485 --> 01:16:19.618
Or I need a snack.
It'’s one of the two.

In fairness,
the music was terrible.

Yeah, I definitely
need to eat something.

Thanks for seeing me today.

I'’m really excited to be here.

a good one.

01:21:31.930 --> 01:21:32.931
You did it.

01:21:34.498 --> 01:21:35.542
We did it.

I think we make
a pretty good team, don'’t we?

Yes, we do.

Did you do the bracelets?

01:21:56.607 --> 01:21:59.262
Yes, of course! My whole arm
was covered in them.

Oh, where have you been?

01:22:21.327 --> 01:22:23.721
Uh, sorry, I was just
out with some friends.

01:22:23.895 --> 01:22:25.766
Come inside.
Come on, come inside.

01:22:27.072 --> 01:22:28.421
It'’s okay, Grandma.

01:22:29.074 --> 01:22:30.162
I'’m okay, I promise.

01:22:32.077 --> 01:22:33.470
Not you.

01:22:33.644 --> 01:22:36.473
Your father.
I'’m sure he'’s okay.

01:22:36.647 --> 01:22:39.911
Just get whatever you need,
and we can talk in the car.

Keys, keys, where are my keys?

I can'’t do it.

I just can'’t do it.

01:22:49.877 --> 01:22:51.140
It'’s okay.

01:22:52.184 --> 01:22:53.316
You'’re okay.

01:22:54.230 --> 01:22:56.536
I need you to help me.

Hey, I'’m right here.[inhales shakily]

01:23:05.371 --> 01:23:07.286
I just can'’t do it again.

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:08.679
You can'’t do what?

01:23:09.375 --> 01:23:11.334
Say goodbye.

01:23:19.342 --> 01:23:20.778
Then don'’t.

I don'’t know what to say.

01:23:26.175 --> 01:23:27.567
What do I tell him?

01:23:31.397 --> 01:23:33.008
You just tell him a story.

01:23:47.848 --> 01:23:49.241

If you could just wait here
a moment.

Oh. I see. Thank you.

01:24:19.228 --> 01:24:20.533
Bea.

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:22.927
Hey, your dad had a long day.

01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:25.060
He just needs some rest.

01:24:32.893 --> 01:24:34.156
[door closes]

01:24:52.348 --> 01:24:53.479
Hi.

01:24:55.742 --> 01:24:56.961
So...

01:24:58.267 --> 01:24:59.920
I'’ve been working
on that story.

01:25:02.967 --> 01:25:05.056
And I'’m ready to tell you now.

01:25:09.365 --> 01:25:11.367
It'’s a story about...

01:25:12.803 --> 01:25:14.109
a little girl.

01:25:16.589 --> 01:25:18.809
A little girl who was so sad

01:25:20.289 --> 01:25:21.725
and so scared

01:25:23.553 --> 01:25:26.251
that she did everything she
could to block the world out...

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:31.343
so she'’d never
have to feel anything again.

01:25:34.955 --> 01:25:36.131
But she couldn'’t.

01:25:38.916 --> 01:25:41.353
She couldn'’t because
she has this person...

01:25:44.313 --> 01:25:45.966
this magical person...

01:25:49.013 --> 01:25:53.670
that, no matter how hard
she tried to push away...

01:25:56.281 --> 01:25:58.718
no matter how hard
she tried to grow up...

01:26:00.720 --> 01:26:02.026
he wouldn'’t let her.

01:26:04.724 --> 01:26:06.857
[crying] He would just
keep holding on to her

01:26:07.727 --> 01:26:09.120
tighter and tighter.

01:26:12.428 --> 01:26:13.646
[sniffling]

01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:15.605
And the funny thing is...

01:26:18.303 --> 01:26:21.611
that'’s the only place
she truly feels safe.

01:26:24.614 --> 01:26:27.660
It'’s the only place
she ever wants to be.

01:26:30.010 --> 01:26:31.751
[crying]

01:26:33.231 --> 01:26:35.146
So you can'’t go anywhere.

01:26:39.542 --> 01:26:41.457
I'’m just a kid.

01:26:45.025 --> 01:26:46.723
Please, Daddy, please.

01:26:48.290 --> 01:26:49.421
Please.

01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:55.122
[sobbing]

01:26:59.562 --> 01:27:02.129
[whispering]
That'’s a really good story.

01:27:04.001 --> 01:27:05.481
What happens next?

01:27:20.147 --> 01:27:22.106
I love you.

01:27:26.284 --> 01:27:28.634
He'’s awake! He'’s awake.

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:30.332
Oh!

01:28:15.855 --> 01:28:16.900
Hey.

01:28:18.162 --> 01:28:19.598
Open the door.

01:28:21.208 --> 01:28:22.297
Hello?

01:28:22.471 --> 01:28:23.820
Who'’s there?

01:28:24.690 --> 01:28:26.126
Open the door.

01:28:28.346 --> 01:28:29.826
[chuckles]

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.176
Are you trying to get in there?

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.484
Uh, yeah. My friend lives here.

01:28:35.658 --> 01:28:37.355
Your friend?

01:28:39.139 --> 01:28:42.012
He helped me, so I just wanted
to tell him thank you.

01:28:42.969 --> 01:28:45.407
Oh, I'’m so sorry.

01:28:50.890 --> 01:28:52.805
[chuckling]
There'’s no one in there.

01:29:22.835 --> 01:29:24.054
All right.

01:29:25.098 --> 01:29:26.404
I think that'’s everything.

01:29:26.578 --> 01:29:29.407
Hey, we can always come back.

01:30:02.875 --> 01:30:04.573
Got everything?Mm-hmm.

01:30:04.747 --> 01:30:06.357
All right, I'’ll be right back.

01:31:16.775 --> 01:31:19.212
Oh, I was just coming
to say goodbye.

01:32:00.993 --> 01:32:02.299
It was you.

01:32:04.736 --> 01:32:06.564
It was always you.

01:32:10.829 --> 01:32:14.398
And I'’m so sorry
that I didn'’t remember sooner.

01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:19.664
You'’re probably
thinking that...

01:32:20.796 --> 01:32:22.624
I don'’t need you anymore.

01:32:24.103 --> 01:32:25.714
That I'’ve grown up.

01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:29.631
So...

01:32:31.023 --> 01:32:33.069
I just had to come tell you

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.899
that I'’ll always need you.

01:32:39.118 --> 01:32:41.251
Especially when I grow up.

01:32:55.308 --> 01:32:56.701
All I have to do

01:32:57.572 --> 01:32:59.138
is close my eyes

01:33:00.487 --> 01:33:02.359
and it all comes rushing back.

[Bea] When I was little,

01:34:11.384 --> 01:34:13.778
I remember telling a story.

01:34:13.952 --> 01:34:17.564
And as I get older, I often
find myself looking back,

01:34:18.609 --> 01:34:20.437
questioning certain details.

01:34:22.439 --> 01:34:26.661
But every time that happens,
I always remind myself

01:34:26.835 --> 01:34:28.184
to take a breath...

01:34:31.535 --> 01:34:33.711
and simply ask myself...

01:34:33.885 --> 01:34:34.973
[sighs]

01:34:35.147 --> 01:34:36.409
..."What IF?"

01:34:37.628 --> 01:34:39.151
They'’ll be fine.

01:34:40.413 --> 01:34:41.676
She'’ll be fine.

01:34:44.896 --> 01:34:45.897
So...

01:34:47.682 --> 01:34:48.987
shall we go in?

01:34:50.989 --> 01:34:52.425
Oh, God.

01:34:52.599 --> 01:34:54.471
[song continues]

01:35:15.971 --> 01:35:17.320
Danny, I'’m back!

01:35:17.494 --> 01:35:19.365
You look great. Love the beard.
How old are you?

01:35:19.539 --> 01:35:21.324
[screams]Cloak-and-dagger!

01:35:21.498 --> 01:35:22.629
[crashing]

01:35:22.804 --> 01:35:24.414
Whatever.

01:35:29.898 --> 01:35:32.161
Come on, let'’s go.[song continues playing]

01:35:32.335 --> 01:35:34.032
You got this.

01:35:37.122 --> 01:35:38.384
[gasps]

01:35:40.822 --> 01:35:42.084
[chuckling] Let'’s go, come on.

01:35:49.439 --> 01:35:50.483
[chimes]

01:36:08.066 --> 01:36:11.069
[song continues playing]

01:36:37.313 --> 01:36:39.358
[chattering]

01:36:47.889 --> 01:36:49.455
[Dragon grunting]

01:36:56.985 --> 01:37:00.031
Hi.[grunts]

01:37:00.205 --> 01:37:02.164
[Dad] Can I admit
something to you?

01:37:02.338 --> 01:37:05.254
I'’m not sure I even know
what a pizza roll is.

01:37:05.428 --> 01:37:06.951
I should'’ve admitted it
earlier, but--

01:37:07.125 --> 01:37:08.779
Hey, is that heavy?A little bit.

01:37:08.953 --> 01:37:10.563
Oh, it is? Okay, great. Don'’t
worry, I got the rest of it.

01:37:10.737 --> 01:37:11.826
Okay?Okay.

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.828
[squeaks][thuds]

01:37:16.439 --> 01:37:17.919
[sighs] Hey, Keith.

01:37:18.093 --> 01:37:19.616
One, two, three, four!
