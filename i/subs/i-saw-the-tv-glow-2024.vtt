01:17.998 --> 01:18.994
<i>This Saturday night</i>

01:19.096 --> 01:21.098
<i>on a brand-new</i> Pink Opaque.

01:21.200 --> 01:23.801
<i>Drain Lords,
hundreds of them,</i>

01:23.903 --> 01:25.303
<i>coming out of the drains!</i>

01:25.405 --> 01:28.204
<i>Isabel's bathroom has
a new supernatural infestation</i>

01:28.306 --> 01:30.942
<i>that no exterminator
can take care of.</i>

01:31.044 --> 01:32.974
<i>It's "The Attack
of the Drain Lords."</i>

01:33.076 --> 01:34.278
<i>10:30p.m./ 9:30 Central,</i>

01:34.380 --> 01:36.412
<i>this Saturday night
on the Young Adult Network.</i>

01:37.611 --> 01:38.915
<i>They can't hurt you</i>

01:39.018 --> 01:41.318
<i>if you don't think about them.</i>

01:41.420 --> 01:44.222
<i>They can't hurt you
if you don't think about them.</i>

02:11.114 --> 02:13.650
Five, four,

02:13.752 --> 02:16.354
three, two,

02:16.456 --> 02:17.519
one!

03:13.975 --> 03:17.148
<i>It was raining last
night and I couldn't sleep,</i>

03:17.250 --> 03:19.482
<i>so I started
my favorite TV show again.</i>

03:20.918 --> 03:22.683
The Pink Opaque.

04:31.619 --> 04:33.554
- Thank you, ma'am.
-Yes.

04:33.656 --> 04:35.756
- Enjoy your night.
-Yeah.

04:39.733 --> 04:40.893
Hey.

04:42.335 --> 04:44.666
Oh, let me take two,
yeah. Thank you.

04:55.574 --> 04:59.381
Owen! Owen, honey.

04:59.483 --> 05:01.584
Come on, honey,
we're ready to go in.

05:03.824 --> 05:04.785
Come on.

05:09.922 --> 05:11.390
I don't know
what he's doing...

05:14.968 --> 05:16.632
- Ready?

05:17.964 --> 05:21.699
Owen, I know
you're not too old for this.

05:21.801 --> 05:23.505
It's been four years.

05:23.608 --> 05:25.774
It's time to vote
for the saxophone man again.

05:25.876 --> 05:27.071
Mom!

05:31.213 --> 05:33.749
Okay. Come on.

05:34.285 --> 05:37.754
Come on. Come-- Owen, come on.

05:37.856 --> 05:39.083
Please.

05:53.537 --> 05:55.302
I don't know.
I don't think so.

06:44.484 --> 06:45.886
Hey.

06:48.387 --> 06:49.725
Hey.

06:53.059 --> 06:54.994
Are your parents voting too?

06:56.703 --> 06:58.734
No.

06:58.836 --> 07:01.406
Ms. Driscoll lets me use
the dark room after school,

07:01.508 --> 07:03.904
so I'm just waiting
for my pictures to dry out.

07:10.383 --> 07:12.517
That looks like
the best book ever.

07:13.447 --> 07:14.915
Yeah, it is.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.385
That's like the TV show, right?

07:19.487 --> 07:20.822
<i>The Pink Opaque?</i>

07:22.560 --> 07:25.222
Yeah. It's the official
episode guide.

07:25.932 --> 07:27.059
Do you watch?

07:30.134 --> 07:32.570
- No.
- Oh.

08:03.070 --> 08:04.701
What grade are you in?

08:05.806 --> 08:06.802
Ninth.

08:11.638 --> 08:13.072
What about you?

08:14.980 --> 08:15.740
Seventh.

08:15.843 --> 08:18.913
My God,
you're a baby.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.530
Election Night is cool, right?

08:33.694 --> 08:36.062
It's like Colonial Day.

08:37.868 --> 08:39.729
Or when they bring
the inflatable planetarium

08:39.831 --> 08:41.034
into the gymnasium.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.209
It's like the school
gets transformed

08:45.311 --> 08:46.908
into something else, you know?

08:50.984 --> 08:52.111
It's special.

08:55.287 --> 08:56.687
It's a kids show, right?

08:58.091 --> 08:59.322
<i>The Pink Opaque?</i>

08:59.424 --> 09:03.628
No. No way. Who told you that?

09:05.095 --> 09:07.566
I mean, yeah, technically it's
on the Young Adult Network.

09:08.201 --> 09:09.326
But it's way too scary,

09:09.428 --> 09:12.502
and the mythology's way
too complicated for most kids.

09:12.604 --> 09:14.632
I see commercials for it
all the time.

09:14.734 --> 09:16.069
It looks amazing.

09:24.718 --> 09:27.014
You can read about the
episodes here, if you want.

09:30.015 --> 09:33.050
It's got quotes and pictures,

09:33.152 --> 09:34.855
and info about
the double bill of bands

09:34.957 --> 09:37.354
that plays each week
at the Double Lunch.

09:44.767 --> 09:47.337
It comes on at 10:30 p.m., right?

09:47.439 --> 09:50.275
Yeah. Every Saturday night.

09:50.377 --> 09:51.509
It's the last show
in the block

09:51.611 --> 09:53.077
before they switch
to black and white reruns

09:53.179 --> 09:54.844
for old people.

09:54.946 --> 09:57.649
My friend Amanda and I
watch it together every week.

10:01.081 --> 10:03.622
My dad won't let me
stay up that late.

10:05.753 --> 10:07.725
10 p.m.'s my bedtime.

10:08.291 --> 10:09.320
Damn.

10:10.395 --> 10:11.960
That absolutely sucks.

10:13.866 --> 10:16.328
My mom basically doesn't give
a crap when I go to bed.

10:21.039 --> 10:22.168
Hey.

10:23.508 --> 10:25.171
You know what you should do?

10:30.514 --> 10:32.343
- Mom?
-Hmm?

10:37.257 --> 10:38.148
Can I have a sleepover

10:38.250 --> 10:40.659
at Johnny Link's house
Saturday night?

10:45.758 --> 10:47.292
Johnny Link?

10:49.595 --> 10:53.133
I didn't even know you guys
were still friends anymore.

10:59.679 --> 11:02.043
Well, honey, you'll have
to ask your father.

11:13.326 --> 11:15.320
Can you ask him for me?

11:50.497 --> 11:51.891
Frank,
Owen wants to go

11:51.993 --> 11:54.425
have a sleepover
at Johnny Link's.

11:56.699 --> 11:59.067
Well... He's old enough.

12:01.537 --> 12:03.038
He's a good kid.

12:32.436 --> 12:33.571
Honey!

12:33.673 --> 12:36.038
You remembered
your inhaler, right?

12:39.178 --> 12:40.812
Yeah.

12:42.282 --> 12:43.408
All right.

13:48.781 --> 13:52.076
And what about a husband?

13:52.178 --> 13:54.347
If I have to.

13:55.114 --> 13:56.855
What about Evan Dando?

13:57.790 --> 13:59.855
I mean, he's cute
but he's so tortured.

13:59.957 --> 14:02.694
I'd have to, like,
save him every day.

14:02.796 --> 14:05.094
Fine.
Then what about Beck?

14:05.196 --> 14:07.998
He's such a spindly
little cutie.

14:13.072 --> 14:15.770
Okay, but we need
more, like, gross guys.

14:15.872 --> 14:17.672
Ugh, what about Joe from Math?

14:17.774 --> 14:18.774
No, he's cute.

14:18.876 --> 14:20.472
What about, like,
Michael Stipe?

14:21.140 --> 14:22.408
I like Michael Stipe.

14:22.510 --> 14:24.609
<i>And now,
a brand-new</i> The Pink Opaque.

14:24.711 --> 14:25.780
Hey.

14:27.183 --> 14:28.947
Is it okay
if I come sit down?

14:29.049 --> 14:31.021
Shut up. It's starting.

14:37.195 --> 14:39.858
<i>Tara is
my imaginary best friend,</i>

14:39.960 --> 14:41.229
<i>and I'm hers.</i>

14:41.864 --> 14:43.232
<i>We met at sleepaway camp</i>

14:43.334 --> 14:47.670
<i>and discovered we had
an ancient psychic connection.</i>

14:48.871 --> 14:50.037
<i>Now, even though we live</i>

14:50.139 --> 14:52.173
<i>on opposite sides
of the county,</i>

14:52.275 --> 14:56.547
<i>we help each other
fight the forces of evil.</i>

14:56.649 --> 15:00.683
<i>We are...</i> The Pink Opaque.

15:15.263 --> 15:18.365
The last Sprinkly Stick
of the summer.

15:19.900 --> 15:21.467
What a bummer.

15:23.068 --> 15:25.240
Definition of.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.177
It's not fair, man.

15:31.279 --> 15:33.049
Why does the winter
have to be so cold

15:33.151 --> 15:35.987
that you can't eat ice cream
during the winter?

15:39.691 --> 15:41.124
You know what I wish?

15:42.687 --> 15:46.226
I wish the Ice Cream Man
didn't have to leave

15:46.328 --> 15:48.829
<i>when the weather
got cold in the winter.</i>

15:50.899 --> 15:52.866
<i>I wish...</i>

15:52.968 --> 15:54.731
<i>he never went away.</i>

16:30.374 --> 16:32.703
You can go out
and join her, if you want.

16:36.144 --> 16:38.478
No, I don't smoke cigarettes.

16:39.312 --> 16:42.119
It's not a cigarette.

16:44.051 --> 16:45.353
It's a Black & Mild.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.131
Are you sure
you don't want a ride home

16:55.233 --> 16:57.061
- with Amanda's mom?

17:00.973 --> 17:03.338
I told my parents
it was a sleepover.

17:25.158 --> 17:26.592
So, did you like it?

17:27.797 --> 17:29.199
The show I mean?

17:31.404 --> 17:33.200
Yeah.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.470
It was...
It was really interesting.

17:38.172 --> 17:40.404
Isabel's a scaredy-cat.

17:40.506 --> 17:41.778
She's kind
of the main character,

17:41.880 --> 17:43.774
but she's also kind of a drip.

17:44.643 --> 17:47.445
Tara's my favorite.
She's super hot,

17:47.547 --> 17:50.415
and she doesn't take shit
from anybody.

17:50.517 --> 17:52.717
Plus, she's an expert
on demonology.

17:54.653 --> 17:58.096
And they never meet up
in person, right?

17:58.397 --> 17:59.627
No.

18:00.497 --> 18:04.067
Just in the pilot episode,
back at sleepaway camp.

18:04.170 --> 18:06.930
But they can communicate
via "the psychic plane."

18:07.032 --> 18:09.365
So, each episode, they help
each other fight a new monster

18:09.467 --> 18:10.702
from across the county.

18:11.776 --> 18:13.144
Okay.

18:15.344 --> 18:17.544
Is the Ice Cream Man
in every episode?

18:18.111 --> 18:20.316
No.

18:21.251 --> 18:22.813
That's just
a Monster of the Week.

18:24.318 --> 18:26.553
Mr. Melancholy is the Big Bad.

18:28.826 --> 18:30.425
Mr. Melancholy?

18:31.224 --> 18:32.691
The Man in the Moon.

18:33.533 --> 18:35.395
Oh, right.

18:35.497 --> 18:37.994
He's always messing
with time and reality.

18:38.530 --> 18:40.104
He wants to rule the world,

18:40.206 --> 18:42.701
to trap Isabel and Tara
in the Midnight Realm.

18:43.576 --> 18:44.404
So each week,

18:44.506 --> 18:46.309
he sends a new
supernatural foe their way.

18:47.509 --> 18:49.639
Because they're part
of The Pink Opaque.

18:49.741 --> 18:53.316
No, because they are
The Pink Opaque.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.286
Right.

18:56.885 --> 18:57.881
Sorry.

19:02.595 --> 19:03.854
Don't apologize.

19:11.903 --> 19:13.401
Well, I'm passing out.

19:13.503 --> 19:15.972
Are you sure it's okay
that I sleep down here?

19:16.074 --> 19:17.967
Just be out by dawn.

19:18.069 --> 19:20.838
If my stepdad catches you,
he'll break my nose again.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.347
And where...
where will you be sleeping?

19:25.014 --> 19:27.581
In my bed... creep.

20:00.347 --> 20:01.516
Sometimes...

20:03.455 --> 20:06.917
<i>The Pink Opaque</i> feels
more real than real life.

20:12.697 --> 20:13.990
You know?

22:27.800 --> 22:29.225
<i>So,</i>

22:29.327 --> 22:32.568
<i>how you feeling about
my little health scare, buddy?</i>

22:34.201 --> 22:35.571
I'm fine.

22:42.507 --> 22:44.512
It just...

22:44.615 --> 22:47.517
seems like you're always
somewhere else lately.

22:49.251 --> 22:51.320
I don't know...

22:51.422 --> 22:53.754
I'm not sure if
it's 'cause of me, or...

22:56.995 --> 22:58.121
I don't know. I...

23:01.067 --> 23:02.900
Maybe I'm just making it up.

23:08.271 --> 23:09.271
Just want to know that

23:09.373 --> 23:12.036
you're on the right path,
you know?

23:26.086 --> 23:28.822
Can I stay up late to watch
<i>The Pink Opaque</i> tonight?

23:30.626 --> 23:32.760
What time does it come on?

23:38.431 --> 23:39.965
10:30 p.m.

23:45.575 --> 23:48.105
You know your bedtime
is at 10:15.

23:51.279 --> 23:53.176
Yeah, but...

23:55.786 --> 24:00.458
no one in the ninth grade
even has a bedtime anymore.

24:11.533 --> 24:14.065
Isn't that a show for girls?

24:26.284 --> 24:28.519
Not tonight, honey.

24:37.158 --> 24:39.893
After that first sleepover,
I couldn't work up the courage

24:39.995 --> 24:44.093
to say more than three words
to Maddy Wilson at a time.

24:44.195 --> 24:46.167
But when I told her
I still wasn't allowed

24:46.269 --> 24:47.732
to watch the show,

24:47.834 --> 24:49.969
she started leaving tapes
for me.

27:20.725 --> 27:23.859
I watched these tapes
over and over again.

27:24.527 --> 27:26.190
But they never got old.

27:52.151 --> 27:55.352
<i>His henchmen
are close by.</i>

27:57.361 --> 27:59.356
Marco and Polo.

27:59.924 --> 28:01.765
Nasty little demons.

28:03.862 --> 28:06.704
And he... he's...

28:10.440 --> 28:11.973
Mr. Melancholy.

28:15.246 --> 28:16.307
That's right.

28:18.977 --> 28:21.477
What's happening to me?

28:22.652 --> 28:26.050
How do I know these things?

28:26.152 --> 28:30.726
Am I going crazy?

28:30.828 --> 28:34.457
No. Never let anyone
convince you of that.

28:35.267 --> 28:36.492
<i>You're like me.</i>

28:38.666 --> 28:40.001
<i>You're special.</i>

28:41.505 --> 28:43.741
We are The Pink Opaque.

28:45.244 --> 28:46.502
It's our destiny.

28:48.039 --> 28:49.205
I knew it from the moment

28:49.307 --> 28:51.111
I saw your tattoo
in the dining hall.

28:52.112 --> 28:54.378
Heck, I knew it before
I even met you.

28:55.715 --> 28:56.781
Can you feel it?

29:04.522 --> 29:07.292
I don't even have
my learner's permit yet.

29:09.297 --> 29:11.428
<i>- How can I have a destiny?</i>
- How can I have a destiny?

30:16.332 --> 30:17.296
Hey.

30:22.835 --> 30:24.204
What's up?

30:25.508 --> 30:26.844
Nothing much.

30:34.618 --> 30:37.580
Um, I was wondering...

30:40.853 --> 30:42.486
Do you, um...

30:43.824 --> 30:46.226
Do you and Amanda

30:46.328 --> 30:48.424
still watch <i>The Pink Opaque</i>
together every week?

30:48.527 --> 30:51.166
I haven't talked to
that asshole in a year.

30:51.268 --> 30:53.865
Amanda told the entire school
that I tried to touch her tit,

30:53.967 --> 30:55.466
which is a total lie!

30:55.568 --> 30:57.367
And then surprise, surprise,
11th grade comes around

30:57.469 --> 30:58.937
and suddenly
it's been her lifelong dream

30:59.039 --> 31:01.571
to join the cheer squad! Ugh!

31:04.149 --> 31:07.049
Secret agent sent here to make
my life miserable, I swear.

31:13.825 --> 31:16.520
If you wanted,
I could come over again.

31:19.493 --> 31:21.764
I've been watching the tapes
you've been making me

31:21.866 --> 31:23.092
but I wanted to watch
<i>The Pink Opaque</i>

31:23.194 --> 31:25.334
on Saturday night again.

31:25.436 --> 31:27.300
While it airs.

31:33.812 --> 31:36.111
I like girls.
You know that, right?

31:36.811 --> 31:38.949
I'm not into boys.

31:39.051 --> 31:43.921
I wasn't...
I... Totally. That's fine.

31:45.151 --> 31:47.122
Okay. I'm just making sure.

31:54.932 --> 31:56.527
What about you?
Do you like girls?

31:59.065 --> 32:03.006
I don't... I don't know.

32:04.309 --> 32:05.437
Boys?

32:07.141 --> 32:12.950
I... I think that
I like TV shows.

32:28.898 --> 32:32.469
When I think about that stuff,

32:32.571 --> 32:34.235
it feels like someone...

32:36.502 --> 32:40.076
took a shovel
and dug out all my insides.

32:42.078 --> 32:47.149
And I know
there's nothing in there,

32:48.114 --> 32:51.247
but I'm still too nervous

32:51.349 --> 32:55.454
to open myself up and check.

33:00.228 --> 33:02.395
I know there's something wrong
with me.

33:03.228 --> 33:04.327
My parents know it too,

33:04.429 --> 33:06.102
even if they don't
say anything.

33:13.437 --> 33:15.672
Do you ever feel like that?

33:25.017 --> 33:26.419
I don't know.

33:34.964 --> 33:36.660
Maybe you're like Isabel...

33:40.904 --> 33:42.567
Afraid of what's inside you.

34:03.521 --> 34:06.960
Hey, Bozo!
Estee Lauder called.

34:07.062 --> 34:08.293
They've got a few suggestions

34:08.395 --> 34:10.829
about this whole look
you're going for.

35:17.132 --> 35:18.861
I'm getting out of this town.

35:25.171 --> 35:26.671
Did you know that?

35:30.009 --> 35:31.313
Soon.

35:43.421 --> 35:44.957
I'll die if I stay here.

35:49.564 --> 35:52.367
I don't know how exactly,
but I know it's true.

36:06.178 --> 36:07.415
If you leave,

36:07.517 --> 36:09.945
I won't have anyone to watch
<i>The Pink Opaque</i> with.

36:35.646 --> 36:36.741
Sit up.

39:06.297 --> 39:07.427
Pack as much as you can

39:07.529 --> 39:09.663
in your overnight bag
next Saturday.

39:14.470 --> 39:16.637
You can't tell anyone
we're leaving.

39:19.371 --> 39:20.740
Not your mom.

39:23.342 --> 39:24.711
Not anyone.

39:32.418 --> 39:33.753
Where will we go?

39:38.393 --> 39:40.089
We'll know when we get there.

39:57.347 --> 39:59.746
Owen? Uh,
Johnny's not home, but...

39:59.848 --> 40:05.353
You have to tell my dad
that I've been lying to him.

40:05.455 --> 40:08.090
I've been pretending
to sleep here

40:08.193 --> 40:09.585
while my mom's
in the hospital.

40:09.687 --> 40:12.389
And I need to be grounded.

40:14.165 --> 40:15.760
Okay. Slow down, honey. What?

40:15.862 --> 40:18.628
You can't let me go with her.

40:18.730 --> 40:21.471
I don't want to leave my home.

40:33.813 --> 40:36.750
<i>My mom passed away
the next July.</i>

40:38.485 --> 40:40.916
<i>And a few weeks later,</i>

40:41.018 --> 40:43.651
<i>Maddy disappeared
without a trace.</i>

40:53.198 --> 40:57.639
All they found was her TV set
burning in the backyard.

41:06.781 --> 41:09.749
<i>And the strangest part
of it all was,</i>

41:09.851 --> 41:13.155
<i>that exact same month
that Maddy disappeared,</i>

41:13.258 --> 41:16.922
The Pink Opaque <i>got canceled.</i>

42:31.065 --> 42:33.803
<i>Welcome

42:33.905 --> 42:35.101
Hello?

42:35.203 --> 42:36.265
<i>Hi.</i>

42:38.337 --> 42:41.171
- Are you ready to take my...
- <i>What would you like, sir?</i>

42:43.548 --> 42:45.206
- Yeah, sorry. Can I get...
<i>- Are you there?</i>

42:45.309 --> 42:47.811
I just want... Can I get
two double cheeseburgers

42:47.913 --> 42:49.882
and a small fries
and a root beer?

42:49.984 --> 42:54.052
<i>- $11.09. Drive around.</i>
- Okay. Okay, thank you.

43:05.203 --> 43:06.600
...answering his phone,

43:06.702 --> 43:08.503
- so I can't start...

43:08.605 --> 43:12.374
...the projector
until I get the key.

43:12.476 --> 43:15.144
Um, so if you could
call me back

43:15.246 --> 43:18.109
and just let me know...

43:19.712 --> 43:22.245
What the hell!

43:26.354 --> 43:27.815
Sorry! Sorry!

43:49.147 --> 43:51.645
Uh, hey, Owen, um,

43:51.747 --> 43:53.980
did you like
what you saw earlier?

43:54.947 --> 43:57.379
- Me and Erica?

44:00.854 --> 44:02.118
You know,
because, if you want,

44:02.220 --> 44:04.859
I can put in a good word
with Erica for you.

44:06.025 --> 44:07.661
She's, like,
obsessed with you, man.

44:07.763 --> 44:08.858
She's like,
"Oh, I love that guy.

44:08.960 --> 44:10.794
"He's so cool! Oh, my God!"

44:10.896 --> 44:12.995
It's "on" for you, brother.

44:13.097 --> 44:14.635
- Come on, man.

44:14.737 --> 44:19.168
Hey, why don't you look at me.
Please.

44:19.270 --> 44:22.305
Just make eye contact with me.
Seriously.

44:33.422 --> 44:34.988
What the heck?

45:01.118 --> 45:02.081
Hello?

45:03.848 --> 45:05.150
Is somebody there?

45:49.730 --> 45:52.930
"Season Six, episode one:

45:53.032 --> 45:55.167
"Escape from
the Midnight Realm."

46:05.411 --> 46:08.548
I'm sorry that I'm late.
There was a downed power line.

46:45.315 --> 46:46.381
<i>Within hours,</i>

46:46.484 --> 46:49.319
<i>90% of Earth's population

46:49.421 --> 46:51.790
<i>The invaders changed

Do you need help?

48:10.133 --> 48:11.567

Maddy?

48:28.623 --> 48:29.651

48:32.060 --> 48:35.765
Jesus, Maddy,

48:49.573 --> 48:51.706

<i>The Pink Opaque.</i>

Of course, I remember

of all time.

52:38.038 --> 52:39.406

No.

watching <i>The Pink Opaque,</i>

53:00.897 --> 53:02.462
how do you remember it?

53:04.098 --> 53:07.434
How do I remember it?

53:08.803 --> 53:09.932
Yeah.

53:10.635 --> 53:13.539
Do you remember it
as just a TV show?

53:20.249 --> 53:23.582
Yeah.
I remember it as a TV show.

53:25.352 --> 53:28.818
<i>The Pink Opaque</i> was a TV show.

53:30.723 --> 53:33.658
We watched it in your basement
on Saturday nights

53:34.999 --> 53:38.859
from 10:30 to 11:00 p.m.
Remember?

53:38.962 --> 53:41.765
The last show
before the Young Adult Network

53:41.867 --> 53:43.998
switched to black and white
reruns for the night.

53:47.776 --> 53:48.739
Yeah.

53:51.474 --> 53:52.875
But are you sure?

Are you sure
that's all it was?

<i>Listen.</i>

54:38.324 --> 54:41.660
do you ever get confused?

54:43.399 --> 54:46.995
Like, maybe the memory
isn't quite right?

54:49.106 --> 54:50.966
What do you mean
"not quite right"?

54:54.271 --> 54:55.443
Like...

54:56.579 --> 54:59.843
Does time ever feel
like it's not moving normally?

55:03.746 --> 55:06.883
Like it's all out of whack?

55:08.052 --> 55:11.554
Do you ever feel like you're
narrating your own life

55:11.656 --> 55:13.522
watching it play
in front of you

55:13.624 --> 55:16.364
like an episode of television?

55:16.466 --> 55:18.463
Or do you ever have
a hard time distinguishing

55:18.565 --> 55:20.365
between what happened
in the show

55:20.467 --> 55:22.470
and what happened
in real life?

55:24.804 --> 55:27.508
Like somehow the memories
got jumbled around?

55:30.948 --> 55:32.506
Shook up in your head.

55:32.608 --> 55:34.416
Like a snow globe.

55:41.618 --> 55:43.392
I'm trying to go slow.

Yeah, I promise.

58:12.075 --> 58:13.509
The final episode?

58:14.771 --> 58:16.677
The end of season five?

58:17.876 --> 58:20.109
You can't trust anybody
in your life.

58:20.844 --> 58:22.650
They're all working for him...

58:24.120 --> 58:25.653
Mr. Melancholy.

58:27.383 --> 58:30.086
I'll be at the high school
tomorrow night at midnight.

58:32.128 --> 58:33.595
I hope you'll come.

59:04.188 --> 59:07.154
<i>A little while
after Maddy disappeared,</i>

59:07.256 --> 59:09.796
<i>she sent me
one more tape in the mail.</i>

59:13.866 --> 59:16.670
<i>Mr. Melancholy
is coming.</i>

59:16.772 --> 59:18.272
<i>If we're going
to defeat him this time,</i>

59:18.374 --> 59:19.441
we're going to need to harness

59:19.543 --> 59:21.508
the full potential
of our shared powers.

59:21.610 --> 59:23.007
<i>We're going to need
to meet again...</i>

59:24.245 --> 59:25.908
in person.

59:26.010 --> 59:30.078
Isabel follows
the sound of Tara's voice

59:30.180 --> 59:31.981
<i>- in the psychic plane...</i>
-<i>Isabel?</i>

59:32.083 --> 59:33.417
-<i>Tara?
- ...back to their old</i>

59:33.519 --> 59:35.523
<i>sleepaway camp.</i>

59:35.625 --> 59:40.189
<i>She finds her at the dock
by the lake,</i>

59:40.291 --> 59:44.633
<i>the place where they
first spoke five seasons ago.</i>

59:51.540 --> 59:56.144
But then,
as Isabel approaches,

59:56.246 --> 59:57.745
she picks something up.

01:00:01.783 --> 01:00:04.980
<i>A stray signal
from the psychic plane.</i>

01:00:05.082 --> 01:00:07.014
<i>Help me. Help me.</i>

01:00:07.116 --> 01:00:11.122
It's a desperate message
from Tara.

01:00:11.491 --> 01:00:12.958
<i>The real Tara.</i>

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.731
She's buried underground...

01:00:18.333 --> 01:00:20.135
in terrible danger.

01:00:20.237 --> 01:00:21.868
<i>Help me, Isabel.</i>

01:00:27.172 --> 01:00:30.844
<i>Mr. Melancholy had
got to her first.</i>

01:00:36.482 --> 01:00:38.016
Marco.

01:00:42.190 --> 01:00:43.156
Polo.

01:01:15.189 --> 01:01:17.990
<i>-<i>They cut out her heart.</i></i>

01:01:32.939 --> 01:01:35.337
<i>They feed her
the Luna Juice.</i>

01:01:47.284 --> 01:01:51.089
<i>And then
he makes his entrance.</i>

01:01:52.295 --> 01:01:54.561
<i>Mr. Melancholy...</i>

01:01:54.663 --> 01:01:56.397
<i>- ...the big bad.</i>

01:02:16.484 --> 01:02:17.951
Don't fight it.

01:02:21.018 --> 01:02:26.223
Let my poison work its magic.

01:02:30.326 --> 01:02:31.863
You're gonna love
the Midnight Realm.

01:02:31.965 --> 01:02:36.699
It's such a wonderful,
wonderful prison.

01:02:52.849 --> 01:02:54.251
It's okay.

01:02:57.154 --> 01:03:01.357
Soon you won't
remember anything.

01:03:03.025 --> 01:03:04.932
Your real name.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:08.430
Your superpowers.

01:03:09.899 --> 01:03:11.334
Your heart.

01:03:14.811 --> 01:03:18.572
You won't even remember
that you're dying!

01:03:48.975 --> 01:03:52.542
<i>They bury her... alive.</i>

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.967
<i>And then...</i>

01:04:18.134 --> 01:04:19.567
<i>...it just ended...</i>

01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:22.207
<i>forever.</i>

01:05:12.289 --> 01:05:15.029
This isn't my home!

01:05:19.198 --> 01:05:22.036
You're not my father!

01:06:42.181 --> 01:06:43.518
I made it all the way
to Phoenix

01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.251
on the money I had saved.

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:50.221
The trees looked different,

01:06:50.323 --> 01:06:52.753
but everything else
was exactly the same.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:58.462
I started using a new name.

01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:03.137
Sleeping at the cheapest
hostel I could find.

01:07:07.942 --> 01:07:10.038
<i>The Pink Opaque</i> was over.

01:07:23.319 --> 01:07:25.291
<i>I got a job at the mall.</i>

01:07:26.056 --> 01:07:27.425
At Build-A-Bear.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:30.659
Filling the dolls up
with stuffing.

01:07:33.362 --> 01:07:35.431
I got out of that town.

01:07:35.533 --> 01:07:38.238
That place I knew
would kill me if I stayed.

01:07:40.073 --> 01:07:42.077
But something was still wrong.

01:07:43.744 --> 01:07:45.146
Wronger, even.

01:07:49.212 --> 01:07:50.613
<i>Time wasn't right.</i>

01:07:56.121 --> 01:07:58.159
It was moving too fast.

01:08:01.162 --> 01:08:04.396
And then I was 19.
And then I was 20.

01:08:07.233 --> 01:08:08.394
I felt like
one of those dolls,

01:08:08.496 --> 01:08:10.435
asleep in the supermarket.

01:08:11.408 --> 01:08:12.404
Stuffed.

01:08:14.974 --> 01:08:16.606
And then I was 21.

01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:21.281
Like chapters skipped over
on a DVD.

01:08:32.662 --> 01:08:34.294
<i>I told myself...</i>

01:08:35.358 --> 01:08:36.725
<i>"This isn't normal.</i>

01:08:39.131 --> 01:08:40.531
<i>"This isn't normal."</i>

01:08:42.798 --> 01:08:45.272
<i>This isn't how life
is supposed to be.</i>

01:08:47.439 --> 01:08:49.573
<i>I thought about
running away again.</i>

01:08:51.242 --> 01:08:52.375
<i>About moving to Santa Fe</i>

01:08:52.477 --> 01:08:54.809
<i>and changing my name
one more time.</i>

01:08:57.012 --> 01:08:59.847
<i>But I knew that everywhere
would be just the same.</i>

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.718
<i>I had seen how it ended.</i>

01:09:04.156 --> 01:09:05.490
<i>I knew where I was.</i>

01:09:12.728 --> 01:09:15.703
A little bit after
my 22nd birthday,

01:09:15.805 --> 01:09:16.696
I paid this burnout kid

01:09:16.798 --> 01:09:19.036
who used to hit on me
in the food court

01:09:19.138 --> 01:09:21.539
$50 to bury me alive.

01:09:24.778 --> 01:09:25.741
I mean...

01:09:27.083 --> 01:09:29.349
he didn't know
he was burying me alive,

01:09:30.617 --> 01:09:33.584
but I doubt he would have
cared too much even if he did.

01:09:38.156 --> 01:09:39.887
I bought a coffin.

01:09:41.158 --> 01:09:42.626
I dug a hole.

01:09:44.166 --> 01:09:47.532
I got inside
and I closed the lid.

01:09:51.367 --> 01:09:52.867
I said to myself,

01:09:54.403 --> 01:09:55.936
"This is crazy.

01:09:56.979 --> 01:09:58.708
"What you're doing is crazy."

01:10:02.581 --> 01:10:04.813
But another part of me
knew that it wasn't.

01:10:07.219 --> 01:10:08.817
That it was survival.

01:10:12.457 --> 01:10:15.360
And that I didn't
have much time.

01:10:15.462 --> 01:10:17.160
That what felt like
years in this world

01:10:17.262 --> 01:10:19.234
was actually just seconds.

01:10:28.238 --> 01:10:29.673
So I waited.

01:10:35.048 --> 01:10:36.812
And then finally,

01:10:39.785 --> 01:10:43.088
the first spadeful of dirt
hit the top of the box.

01:10:46.224 --> 01:10:47.691
And then another.

01:10:49.931 --> 01:10:51.431
And then another.

01:10:58.567 --> 01:11:00.572
I sang songs to myself.

01:11:02.478 --> 01:11:05.643
I counted to 10,000
without skipping any numbers.

01:11:08.677 --> 01:11:10.780
I pissed and I shit my pants

01:11:11.547 --> 01:11:12.648
and I forced my mouth

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:15.650
to produce whatever saliva
it could muster

01:11:15.752 --> 01:11:18.051
just so I would
have something to drink.

01:11:29.370 --> 01:11:31.834
I screamed
as loud as I could for help.

01:11:33.307 --> 01:11:36.003
I apologized
for the whole thing.

01:11:36.105 --> 01:11:39.611
And I begged God for someone
to come along and save me.

01:11:40.612 --> 01:11:44.077
I tried and tried
to claw my way out,

01:11:44.179 --> 01:11:47.355
but that burnout guy had
packed the dirt in too tight

01:11:48.388 --> 01:11:50.490
just like I had
asked him to do.

01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:57.332
And then,

01:11:59.431 --> 01:12:01.600
after I don't know how long,

01:12:03.965 --> 01:12:07.441
I felt myself
start to leave myself.

01:12:10.543 --> 01:12:12.111
And it was like
I was watching myself

01:12:12.213 --> 01:12:14.448
on TV from across the room.

01:12:16.612 --> 01:12:17.777
And I was moving further

01:12:17.879 --> 01:12:20.014
and further away
from the screen

01:12:21.387 --> 01:12:22.883
until the screen was so small

01:12:22.985 --> 01:12:25.789
that I couldn't even
see myself anymore.

01:12:47.176 --> 01:12:50.385
And then I was clawing
my way up out of the ground.

01:12:51.714 --> 01:12:53.616
And then I was at the surface,

01:12:53.718 --> 01:12:58.156
gasping for air,
rain pouring down on me.

01:12:58.258 --> 01:12:59.757
Thunder and lightning.

01:13:02.131 --> 01:13:03.926
And I was finally back there.

01:13:05.696 --> 01:13:07.864
Back at our old
sleepaway camp.

01:13:12.871 --> 01:13:15.806
And just like I was waking up
from a bad dream,

01:13:16.572 --> 01:13:18.907
that whole life...

01:13:19.009 --> 01:13:22.450
that whole reality
where I was Maddy Wilson...

01:13:23.413 --> 01:13:24.947
drifted away.

01:13:26.187 --> 01:13:27.819
Like a brief hallucination

01:13:27.921 --> 01:13:30.953
that, after a few moments,
I could hardly even remember.

01:13:32.121 --> 01:13:35.188
And all those memories
that had felt so real

01:13:36.593 --> 01:13:38.165
washed away with the rain

01:13:38.267 --> 01:13:40.435
back at our old
sleepaway camp.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:44.604
And I was me.

01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:47.442
I was finally me again.

01:13:49.311 --> 01:13:51.479
And it was
the season six premiere.

01:13:55.447 --> 01:13:57.881
I tried looking for you,

01:13:57.983 --> 01:14:01.016
but Mr. Melancholy had
covered his tracks too well.

01:14:02.525 --> 01:14:05.223
I knew you must be buried
somewhere close by,

01:14:05.325 --> 01:14:06.791
but I didn't know where.

01:14:08.261 --> 01:14:10.498
And your signal...

01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:12.659
That signal that I used to be
able to close my eyes

01:14:12.761 --> 01:14:14.469
and feel so vividly...

01:14:15.036 --> 01:14:17.032
was nowhere.

01:14:17.134 --> 01:14:19.969
I wasn't picking up anything
on the psychic plane.

01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:27.911
I found my heart.

01:14:30.217 --> 01:14:31.882
Isabel, oh, my God!

01:14:32.714 --> 01:14:34.247
I found yours, too.

01:14:35.718 --> 01:14:37.525
And it was still beating,

01:14:39.188 --> 01:14:42.827
stored indefinitely in...

01:14:44.397 --> 01:14:46.666
In an industrial freezer!

01:14:51.668 --> 01:14:52.635
I left our hearts there

01:14:52.737 --> 01:14:54.575
because I knew
I wasn't done yet.

01:14:56.577 --> 01:14:58.843
And I found
Mr. Melancholy's cauldron.

01:14:59.478 --> 01:15:00.513
I found the Luna Juice

01:15:00.615 --> 01:15:03.683
he used to send us
to the Midnight Realm,

01:15:03.785 --> 01:15:06.719
then I took a big sip
straight out from the ladle.

01:15:08.685 --> 01:15:10.118
And I laid back down...

01:15:12.020 --> 01:15:14.287
and I waited
to fall back asleep.

01:15:17.026 --> 01:15:19.259
I knew I needed
to come back here.

01:15:20.965 --> 01:15:23.670
I knew I needed to come back
and save you.

01:15:26.407 --> 01:15:28.609
So that the show can continue.

01:15:29.807 --> 01:15:32.173
So that we can
get to season six.

01:15:37.249 --> 01:15:38.245
Maddy.

01:15:40.782 --> 01:15:42.649
That's not my name.

01:15:44.152 --> 01:15:45.753
And I haven't
told you anything tonight

01:15:45.855 --> 01:15:47.727
that you don't already know.

01:15:52.528 --> 01:15:53.733
Tell me.

01:15:55.733 --> 01:15:57.330
Tell me you know it's true.

01:16:02.273 --> 01:16:03.776
I...

01:16:05.546 --> 01:16:07.780
You told me yourself
you felt it.

01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:12.884
Remember? On the bleachers?

01:16:13.752 --> 01:16:16.223
You know
what he put inside you.

01:16:16.325 --> 01:16:19.594
This... This is insane. I...

01:16:20.461 --> 01:16:22.927
I remember... I remember...

01:16:24.859 --> 01:16:26.994
playing in the snow.

01:16:27.096 --> 01:16:31.298
Driving to baseball games
with my dad.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.969
Cooking with my mom.

01:16:34.072 --> 01:16:36.908
Those memories were put there
to distract you.

01:16:38.708 --> 01:16:40.307
To keep you trapped.

01:16:46.181 --> 01:16:48.788
This isn't the Midnight Realm,
Maddy,

01:16:49.918 --> 01:16:51.857
it's just the suburbs.

01:16:59.896 --> 01:17:02.098
I told you that's not my name.

01:17:05.905 --> 01:17:08.302
And we need to go back down
into the soil.

01:17:10.078 --> 01:17:11.074
Tonight.

01:17:12.676 --> 01:17:14.308
The longer you wait

01:17:15.650 --> 01:17:18.048
the closer you get
to suffocating.

01:17:23.359 --> 01:17:24.956
<i>I've got everything ready.</i>

01:17:26.992 --> 01:17:29.994
<i>That spot
behind the football field</i>

01:17:30.096 --> 01:17:32.997
<i>where the stoners
used to get high after school.</i>

01:17:36.372 --> 01:17:37.936
<i>No one will find us there.</i>

01:18:12.767 --> 01:18:14.005
Come on.

01:18:15.677 --> 01:18:18.240
I know it's scary.
That's part of it.

01:18:33.725 --> 01:18:35.158
It's like the Drain Lords.

01:18:36.057 --> 01:18:38.095
Just like the Drain Lords.

01:18:40.098 --> 01:18:42.902
It's not real
if I don't think about it.

01:18:44.172 --> 01:18:45.234
Isabel.

01:19:44.933 --> 01:19:47.400
<i>After that night
on the football field,</i>

01:19:47.502 --> 01:19:49.298
<i>I locked myself inside.</i>

01:19:50.970 --> 01:19:53.038
<i>I didn't leave the house
for days.</i>

01:19:55.041 --> 01:19:57.839
<i>I kept waiting for her
to show back up</i>

01:19:57.941 --> 01:19:59.880
<i>to force me underground.</i>

01:20:04.584 --> 01:20:06.183
But she never did.

01:20:06.851 --> 01:20:08.922
I never saw her again.

01:20:15.259 --> 01:20:18.195
<i>I told myself
I made the right choice.</i>

01:20:18.297 --> 01:20:21.561
<i>Maddy's story was insane.
It couldn't be true.</i>

01:20:24.472 --> 01:20:26.070
<i>But some nights,</i>

01:20:26.172 --> 01:20:28.436
<i>when I was working late
at the movie theater,</i>

01:20:28.538 --> 01:20:32.405
<i>I found myself wondering,
what if she was right?</i>

01:20:32.507 --> 01:20:35.047
<i>What if she had been
telling the truth?</i>

01:20:36.147 --> 01:20:38.512
<i>What if I really
was someone else?</i>

01:20:40.184 --> 01:20:43.418
<i>Someone beautiful
and powerful.</i>

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:47.125
<i>Someone buried alive
and suffocating to death.</i>

01:20:48.397 --> 01:20:49.357
<i>Very far away,</i>

01:20:49.459 --> 01:20:51.492
<i>on the other side
of the television screen.</i>

01:20:55.131 --> 01:20:57.470
<i>But I know that's not true.</i>

01:20:57.572 --> 01:20:59.500
<i>That's just fantasy.</i>

01:21:01.343 --> 01:21:02.503
<i>Kid's stuff.</i>

01:21:25.835 --> 01:21:28.769
<i>The movie theater closed
the next fall.</i>

01:21:28.871 --> 01:21:30.502
<i>My manager brought me
along with him</i>

01:21:30.604 --> 01:21:33.072
<i>to the Fun Center.</i>

01:21:33.174 --> 01:21:37.208
<i>I work there now restocking
the ball pit with balls.</i>

01:21:41.150 --> 01:21:45.282
<i>My father passed away in 2010
after his second stroke.</i>

01:21:46.787 --> 01:21:49.423
<i>Time moves fast these days.</i>

01:21:49.525 --> 01:21:52.155
<i>Years pass like seconds.</i>

01:21:52.258 --> 01:21:55.028
<i>I just try not to think
too hard about it.</i>

01:21:58.493 --> 01:22:00.627
<i>I decided to stay
in the house.</i>

01:22:02.035 --> 01:22:04.334
<i>It was time for me
to become a man.</i>

01:22:05.441 --> 01:22:07.169
<i>A real adult.</i>

01:22:07.271 --> 01:22:09.537
<i>A productive
member of society.</i>

01:22:10.372 --> 01:22:12.408
<i>And that's exactly what I did.</i>

01:22:16.278 --> 01:22:18.883
I even got a family of my own.

01:22:18.985 --> 01:22:20.988
I love them
more than anything.

01:23:19.406 --> 01:23:21.708
Anyway, like I was saying,

01:23:21.810 --> 01:23:24.246
it was raining the other night
and I couldn't sleep,

01:23:24.348 --> 01:23:26.647
so I started
<i>The Pink Opaque</i> again.

01:23:29.484 --> 01:23:31.617
<i>It's available to stream now.</i>

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:33.621
<i>- You don't even need a disc.</i>

01:23:37.625 --> 01:23:39.963
<i>I started</i>
The Pink Opaque <i>again.</i>

01:23:42.203 --> 01:23:44.665
<i>And it was nothing
like I remembered it.</i>

01:23:45.773 --> 01:23:47.536
<i>Hey, Mr. Ice Cream Man.</i>

01:23:48.771 --> 01:23:51.612
<i>Stop turning all my friends
into popsicle sticks!</i>

01:23:51.714 --> 01:23:52.978
<i>But I'm so lonely.</i>

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.048
<i>I have nothing to do
all winter.</i>

01:23:55.150 --> 01:23:58.212
<i>The whole thing felt
cheesy and cheap.</i>

01:23:58.314 --> 01:24:00.615
<i>Dated, and not scary at all.</i>

01:24:05.761 --> 01:24:06.819
<i>I know!</i>

01:24:06.921 --> 01:24:08.893
<i>In the winter time,
instead of selling ice cream,</i>

01:24:08.995 --> 01:24:11.131
<i>you can sell soup instead.</i>

01:24:13.694 --> 01:24:16.032
<i>Why didn't I think of that?</i>

01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:18.066
<i>Let's all have a soup party!</i>

01:24:18.168 --> 01:24:20.503
<i>Yay, a soup party!</i>

01:24:32.514 --> 01:24:34.484
<i>I just felt embarrassed.</i>

01:25:12.255 --> 01:25:13.853
<i>Marco.</i>

01:25:14.958 --> 01:25:16.328
<i>Polo.</i>

01:25:18.965 --> 01:25:21.333
<i>You got me!</i>

01:26:07.842 --> 01:26:11.182
Go, go, go!
Get it! Get it!

01:26:11.284 --> 01:26:15.449

01:26:15.551 --> 01:26:19.857

01:26:19.959 --> 01:26:21.657
