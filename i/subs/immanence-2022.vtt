<i>Consort 4004
go for harness deploy of AFT.</i>

00:52.285 --> 00:53.220
<i>AFT away.</i>

00:55.757 --> 00:58.258
<i>As soon as you mark
the flare on back of left 40.</i>

00:59.661 --> 01:03.296
<i>Eighty-eight header

01:03.397 --> 01:04.699
<i>Calling it in.</i>

01:06.199 --> 01:10.738
<i>Oh-three-seventeen we've got a red
emergency beacon visible left 20.</i>

01:11.371 --> 01:12.439
<i>I see a raft.</i>

01:12.807 --> 01:13.841
<i>It's got to be all of them,</i>

01:13.941 --> 01:14.842
<i>there's nobody over here.</i>

01:14.942 --> 01:16.309
<i>It's a total ghost town.</i>

01:17.244 --> 01:18.345
<i>How many souls aboard?</i>

01:18.713 --> 01:20.514
<i>Manifest showing six.</i>

01:21.716 --> 01:24.551
<i>Hold on, zero four,
when was contact on this again?</i>

01:24.652 --> 01:27.521
<i>Distress signal
was activated at 23:39.</i>

01:27.622 --> 01:29.624
<i>At 11:39, roger that.</i>

01:29.924 --> 01:33.260
<i>It's a raft.
Stand by for a count of survivors.</i>

01:33.360 --> 01:36.363
<i>Can't be all of them.
No way they got six people in that thing.</i>

01:36.463 --> 01:37.732
<i>It doesn't make sense.</i>

01:37.832 --> 01:38.900
<i>There's nothing wrong
with the boat.</i>

01:39.000 --> 01:40.267
<i>Why in the hell jump ship?</i>

01:41.334 --> 01:42.770
<i>Here we go.
Got movement down there.</i>

01:42.870 --> 01:44.772
- <i>How many?</i>
- Standby,

01:44.872 --> 01:48.776
<i>I'll have lights up
in three, two, one.</i>

02:44.732 --> 02:47.602
And then, it's that moment
in time when you're driving

02:47.702 --> 02:49.971
- and you see the animal cross the road and you try to go...
- Mm-hmm.

02:50.071 --> 02:53.641
...well, am I going to move
the car left, right,

02:53.741 --> 02:54.709
or am I just gonna hit it?

02:57.444 --> 03:00.413
<i>You know, I wouldn't be calling
you if this wasn't serious Roman.</i>

03:00.514 --> 03:04.652
<i>I've got three sets of eyes on this data,
we all agree it could be the real thing.</i>

03:04.752 --> 03:08.455
<i>The only question is how soon
can you get out there on a boat?</i>

03:09.657 --> 03:13.393
<i>Jonah this is Father Marquez,
call me right back as soon as you get this.</i>

03:13.493 --> 03:15.863
<i>No, no, let him down!</i>

03:15.963 --> 03:19.767
<i>If you're still looking for the
real thing I can show it to you.</i>

03:19.867 --> 03:21.803
Thy kingdom come
thy will be done on Earth

03:21.903 --> 03:23.070
as it is in heaven.

03:23.171 --> 03:25.572
Give us this day
our daily bread.

03:25.673 --> 03:29.342
Forgive us our trespassers as we
forgive those who trespass against us,

03:29.442 --> 03:30.878
and lead us not into temptation

03:30.978 --> 03:33.346
but deliver us from evil, amen.

03:34.081 --> 03:37.350
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

03:37.450 --> 03:40.320
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.595
...be thy name,

03:48.696 --> 03:50.463
thy kingdom come,
thy will be done.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.766
What are you doing?

03:52.599 --> 03:54.068
You don't pull a gun
on a man like that.

03:54.836 --> 03:56.804
What I'm looking for
is the real thing.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.572
This ain't it.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.109
Keep looking.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.658
<i>Jonah this is Father Dunne up in Jacksonville.</i>

04:17.758 --> 04:20.061
<i>Got a woman
hearing voices in Latin.</i>

04:20.795 --> 04:22.529
<i>Could be something
you're looking for.</i>

04:22.630 --> 04:24.966
<i>I woke up paralyzed</i>

04:25.066 --> 04:27.935
<i>and there is something heavy
pressing down on my chest.</i>

04:28.603 --> 04:30.771
<i>This Emily from the Satanic Temple</i>

04:30.872 --> 04:32.073
<i>I am just returning
your call.</i>

05:02.703 --> 05:04.537
Mom, you left
your bag out again.

05:04.639 --> 05:06.406
Everything's
going to get stolen.

05:08.075 --> 05:10.543
You'll be happy to know I didn't
get pregnant while I was out.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.512
I also didn't mow the lawn yet,

05:12.613 --> 05:14.015
but I'll do that
when I get back.

05:14.115 --> 05:16.684
And I made you two dinners
for the next few nights.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.886
Oh, God damn it.

05:23.124 --> 05:24.158
- Mom...
- Amen.

05:30.064 --> 05:31.032
Naomi?

05:32.532 --> 05:36.436
Do you think you could please refrain
from taking the Lord's name in vain

05:36.536 --> 05:38.438
at the exact moment
I am praying to Him?

05:38.538 --> 05:39.974
It's an expression, Mom.

05:40.074 --> 05:40.942
I know.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.177
And it is also a commandment.

05:46.280 --> 05:49.083
Alright. I don't know how many
days exactly I'm going to be gone.

05:49.183 --> 05:50.785
- Naomi...
- Yeah?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.488
Do you know why
they did that to him?

05:56.123 --> 05:58.192
Do you know?
Because he was one of them,

05:58.292 --> 06:00.127
and he healed them
and he blessed them.

06:00.227 --> 06:01.896
- Do you know why they did that to him?
- Mom,

06:01.996 --> 06:04.564
- I've got the car running. I've gotta go.
- Why?

06:04.665 --> 06:07.168
Uh, isn't it what he said?
They didn't know what they were doing.

06:07.268 --> 06:10.037
They knew what they were doing.
They knew exactly what they were doing.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.940
They knew who he was.
They saw the light.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.977
Naomi, they like the darkness.

06:16.077 --> 06:16.944
Mom, I've got to go.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.813
Do you have your cross?

06:18.913 --> 06:20.181
- I've got it.
- In your pocket?

06:20.281 --> 06:21.548
I'm wearing it.

06:21.649 --> 06:22.850
Is it still on that long chain?

06:22.950 --> 06:24.085
Yes, Mom.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.855
- Naomi.
- Okay, don't worry about these bills,

06:27.955 --> 06:29.123
I'll take care of them
when I get back.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.225
- Naomi.
- Ok, bye, Mom.

06:38.132 --> 06:40.601
Hey, look for the boat Odyssey.

06:40.701 --> 06:42.502
- We're waiting on you.
- What is going on?

06:42.603 --> 06:44.171
Is that that meteor?
It looked like it came out of nowhere.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.040
Everyone gets
the full briefing on the boat.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.709
Roman, I'm not one of
your grad students anymore.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.011
I know it.

06:50.111 --> 06:51.612
And so does our patron.

06:51.712 --> 06:52.880
Patron who?

06:52.980 --> 06:54.081
Housekeeping first.

06:55.216 --> 06:56.717
We lock everything down.
We jump through all the hoops.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.285
It sounds really big. Come on.

06:58.386 --> 07:00.921
What I am at liberty to say
is this, we get out there first,

07:01.022 --> 07:04.058
we find anything. We've already
been offered the whole package.

07:04.759 --> 07:07.228
Okay? Three years funded,

07:07.328 --> 07:09.830
labs, offices, residents.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.932
And the, they, they want me
to have a co-director,

07:12.033 --> 07:13.234
asked me for three names.

07:13.968 --> 07:15.002
I gave them one.

07:16.370 --> 07:18.973
Hey, it's long overdue.
Everybody knows it.

07:19.073 --> 07:20.875
I mean, this is it, okay?

07:20.975 --> 07:23.210
We get you out of here.
We get your own staff,

07:23.310 --> 07:25.679
your own place,
get you away from your...

07:26.313 --> 07:27.547
My mom.

07:27.648 --> 07:28.783
Well, yeah, but not just that,

07:28.883 --> 07:29.817
you know, everything.

07:30.818 --> 07:33.721
You know, just, just,
just move on, move up.

07:34.789 --> 07:35.790
I need this.

07:36.157 --> 07:37.590
I don't have to tell you that.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.327
But hey, this is how
it happens, huh?

07:42.163 --> 07:43.931
- Odyssey.
- Odyssey.

07:44.031 --> 07:44.999
Hurry up.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.802
Are we synchronizing
to the baseline or the negative?

08:21.902 --> 08:23.170
I know it's
short notice, but I'll need

08:23.270 --> 08:24.772
lab time for at least...

08:24.872 --> 08:26.240
Hey, is that the one
we calibrated earlier?

08:26.340 --> 08:27.808
Yeah.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.777
Can you turn that that down?
Hold on, hold on.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.846
- Sorry.
- Anyway, as long as we set this all out...

08:33.047 --> 08:34.348
- Hey girls.
- Hey.

08:34.448 --> 08:37.284
Alright, alright,
welcome aboard, I'm Davis.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.653
- Hi, Naomi.
- Naomi, nice to meet you.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.088
- Hey, Suzu.
- Suzu.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.691
- Harper.
- Harper, Harper, Harper,

08:43.791 --> 08:45.192
what, what are you,
what are you playing?

08:45.292 --> 08:46.660
It's a Perseid Soundscape.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.696
It gets me in the mood
for science.

08:48.796 --> 08:51.398
Oh same, oh that's
my all-time favorite band.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.200
That's not a band.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.869
Actually it's a meteor shower.

08:54.969 --> 08:56.137
Oh, well, you know,
meteor showers.

08:56.237 --> 08:57.738
They, they play music.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.340
Yeah. Yeah.
Everybody knows that.

08:59.440 --> 09:01.709
Technically, it's ionization
caused by the heat trails,

09:01.809 --> 09:03.878
which then reflects
shortwave radio signals.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.347
Basically a random
tone generator.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.786
I like to think of it as the
death rattle of ancient stardust.

09:12.887 --> 09:14.388
Now that's appropriate
'cause that shit's killing me.

09:15.189 --> 09:17.091
Hmm, really? Okay.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.293
Don't be inspired.
I'll listen to it all by myself.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.162
- That's great.
- We're all here, all here.

09:21.262 --> 09:22.429
All aboard, ok.

09:22.530 --> 09:23.430
Hey, Jonah.

09:23.531 --> 09:24.865
Take us out.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.918
Uh, Naomi can I get the time?

09:44.818 --> 09:45.886
Eight thirteen.

09:46.987 --> 09:49.223
Left at 20:13 the departure
voyage of the Odyssey

09:49.323 --> 09:51.358
with the number of souls
at the count of six,

09:51.458 --> 09:53.093
please and thank you.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.885
Some trash,
I'm sorry about this.

10:51.986 --> 10:54.822
- So I guess this is a party boat.
- No, I wouldn't call it that.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.124
I would say we're more like
an entertainment company.

10:57.224 --> 10:58.359
I mean, we're
all types of things,

10:58.459 --> 11:00.394
we can be anything
you need us to be.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.530
I'm guessing it's the first time
you've been an observation lab.

11:03.632 --> 11:04.765
No.

11:05.466 --> 11:06.467
Yes.

11:06.567 --> 11:08.435
And this is the junior suite.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.306
Uh, well, it's a little tight,
but it sleeps at least three people.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.808
But we actually got
12 people there at one time,

11:14.908 --> 11:15.843
if you can believe that.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.077
Look at this.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.013
Look at the room,
it's got, oh shoot.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.949
I mean, do I even want to know?

11:22.617 --> 11:26.186
Look, we have particular clients
that wanted a party boat, ok?

11:26.287 --> 11:27.888
Everybody can't be
rocket scientists.

11:28.489 --> 11:30.958
- Astrophysicists.
- Okay.

11:31.425 --> 11:32.426
Hey, can I ask you a question?

11:32.526 --> 11:33.160
Yeah.

11:34.161 --> 11:35.262
What are you guys doing here?

11:38.232 --> 11:40.968
When Roman asked you to book
the boat, what did he say?

11:41.068 --> 11:42.536
He said, I want
to charter your boat.

11:42.637 --> 11:44.505
And when you asked, what for?

11:44.606 --> 11:47.007
Oh, it didn't even go that far,
once the man offered me

11:47.107 --> 11:49.943
like double to leave in an hour,
there were no questions asked.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.048
I mean, all I know is what
he asked me to bring.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.252
Non-disclosure agreements.

11:58.352 --> 12:00.954
You mention any of this
to anyone off this boat,

12:01.055 --> 12:02.056
and you go to jail.

12:02.156 --> 12:03.557
Sign it, everyone sign it.

12:03.658 --> 12:05.426
But, requested by who,
the university?

12:05.526 --> 12:07.494
Requested by SETI.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.930
Whaa...

12:10.030 --> 12:12.199
- Are you serious, SETI called us?
- SETI?

12:12.299 --> 12:15.002
- Wow!
- Search for Extra Terrestrial intelligence.

12:15.603 --> 12:17.271
Oh, come on, beam me up.

12:17.371 --> 12:19.440
He's going to need to...
uh, who's this?

12:19.540 --> 12:20.908
Oh, that's Jonah.

12:25.613 --> 12:28.515
- I own the boat, he runs the boat.
- Got it.

12:28.616 --> 12:30.451
Can we please,
I'm dying here.

12:31.185 --> 12:33.287
Alright. Okay, okay.

12:35.623 --> 12:36.557
Alright, here we go.

12:37.692 --> 12:40.394
Three hours ago, as many of you
saw with your own eyes,

12:40.494 --> 12:43.163
a bright streak cut down
the horizon on this trajectory.

12:43.497 --> 12:47.201
This directly coincides with an
anomaly event recorded at SETI.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.104
Registering coordinates
northeast of Miami.

12:51.505 --> 12:54.341
A meteor or maybe
a piece of satellite debris,

12:54.441 --> 12:58.078
I mean, hardly worth an NDA
without some sort of...

12:58.312 --> 12:59.880
- Communication.
- Yeah.

13:01.248 --> 13:05.352
Okay, what if I said
at the time of the anomaly event,

13:05.452 --> 13:09.156
a NASA satellite passed directly
over this exact geographic location,

13:09.256 --> 13:12.192
in that split second,
multiple sensors were triggered.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.931
What frequency were the waves,
single sideband?

13:18.031 --> 13:20.934
With a possible signature
of amplitude modulation.

13:22.503 --> 13:25.038
Okay, what does that mean?

13:25.139 --> 13:26.608
A medium wave carrier signal.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.076
- Oh.
- Sound.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.310
It'll be another four hours

13:30.411 --> 13:31.545
before we can capture
the signal again,

13:31.646 --> 13:33.213
but by that time
we'll already be there.

13:33.313 --> 13:35.549
Was just one burst,
was the pattern repeated?

13:36.550 --> 13:39.052
- We don't know yet.
- Hold on. We know what's out there.

13:39.153 --> 13:41.522
NASA tracks over twenty
thousand meteors.

13:41.623 --> 13:42.956
We would have seen this coming.

13:43.056 --> 13:44.591
Yes, unless

13:44.692 --> 13:47.327
it came at us
from directly behind the sun

13:47.428 --> 13:49.596
and we didn't see it until it
was too late. And by too late,

13:49.697 --> 13:52.433
I mean, a blip
on a radar screen two days ago.

13:53.100 --> 13:56.370
Wait, you're saying this thing went
from the sun to earth in two days?

13:57.504 --> 14:01.542
Extrasolar velocity,
I mean, it has to be.

14:01.643 --> 14:04.545
Nothing from inside our
solar system travels that fast.

14:04.646 --> 14:08.348
It's... So an extrasolar object touches
down and then erupts with radio signals.

14:09.751 --> 14:13.187
By this time tomorrow,
everyone will be all over this.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.088
And we're the
only ones going out there.

14:15.189 --> 14:17.458
We're the only ones
that even know about this.

14:17.558 --> 14:19.426
NASA isn't going to pull the
trigger on something this big

14:19.526 --> 14:21.328
until they get
secondary confirmation.

14:21.428 --> 14:24.364
So said SETI called us
to get there first.

14:24.465 --> 14:26.533
We're in the right
place at the right time,

14:26.634 --> 14:28.402
what can I say?

14:28.502 --> 14:31.538
Hold on,
are you guys chasing aliens?

14:32.506 --> 14:33.608
Uh, HEBs.

14:33.708 --> 14:35.542
Highly evolved beings.

14:36.510 --> 14:37.544
Aliens.

14:38.813 --> 14:40.581
- Pretty big leap.
- Excuse me?

14:45.219 --> 14:48.288
It's a pretty big leap
to aliens.

14:51.626 --> 14:53.360
Meteor strikes happen

14:53.460 --> 14:57.030
and it could be a lightning
storm around the area,

14:57.130 --> 14:59.333
I mean they emit
radio waves too, right?

15:03.638 --> 15:06.273
Uh, fair enough.
That, that's true,

15:06.373 --> 15:11.211
but to say that the signal came from around
the same time and place is inaccurate.

15:11.311 --> 15:14.616
It came from exactly the same time and
place consistent with cause and effect.

15:15.382 --> 15:17.317
To say nothing
of the trajectory.

15:17.417 --> 15:20.087
I mean, this thing is coming from
the other side of the galaxy.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.355
Who knows how long it
took to get there.

15:21.455 --> 15:23.524
And it comes
to our exact location.

15:24.525 --> 15:27.795
Even if it defied those odds,
it wouldn't emit radio waves.

15:31.565 --> 15:34.201
Well, lightning storms out here
have pretty high odds, too.

15:34.836 --> 15:36.370
I'm sorry, where did you study?

15:40.240 --> 15:41.208
YouTube.

15:43.577 --> 15:45.379
Now I know how doctors feel.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.718
No, but you have to admit
that even your scenario

15:50.818 --> 15:53.688
starts to seem just
as implausible as, as mine,

15:53.788 --> 15:57.625
right? A, a direct bull's eye earth
after slingshot around the sun,

15:57.725 --> 16:00.294
a lightning strike at
exactly the same moment.

16:00.394 --> 16:01.663
I mean, too much coincidence.

16:02.730 --> 16:05.399
I don't disagree, except
for the word coincidence.

16:05.900 --> 16:08.135
Okay, what, what would you say?

16:10.805 --> 16:11.739
A sign.

16:11.839 --> 16:13.608
A sign? A sign of what?

16:17.812 --> 16:20.314
Oh, right.

16:21.716 --> 16:22.817
Right.

16:23.417 --> 16:26.754
Right.
Of course. Yes.

16:26.854 --> 16:31.158
No, this isn't a scientific, uh, breakthrough,
it's not even a cosmic coincidence.

16:31.258 --> 16:34.428
It's, it's God,
ladies and gentlemen, it's God.

16:40.635 --> 16:43.370
Uh, different viewpoints
are welcome, of course.

16:44.739 --> 16:46.708
Not different, really. I mean,

16:47.407 --> 16:51.511
the search for HEBs
is the search for God.

16:56.684 --> 16:58.418
You guys are going
to be best friends.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.723
- Thank you.
- Here.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.454
- Hey.
- Oh my gosh.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.389
- What's going on?
- I don't know. I...

18:09.489 --> 18:11.391
- Are you ok?...
- I heard something like an animal, I mean,

18:11.491 --> 18:13.293
- can rats get on a boat?
- What is it? Rats?

18:17.732 --> 18:18.933
I guess it was nothing,

18:20.034 --> 18:21.435
maybe a bad dream.

18:21.535 --> 18:22.502
Forget it.

18:23.971 --> 18:25.272
Do you feel that?

18:27.642 --> 18:29.476
The boat is not moving.

18:31.344 --> 18:32.412
Did we stop?

18:43.024 --> 18:44.424
Jonah, look at that water.

18:46.627 --> 18:48.462
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

18:49.463 --> 18:52.900
Nobody's ever seen anything like
this because it's impossible.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.435
A pond or a lake
on a good night, maybe,

18:55.535 --> 18:57.537
but the sea? No.

18:57.638 --> 19:00.540
Maybe not impossible,
but highly abnormal.

19:00.942 --> 19:01.976
What about oil?

19:02.076 --> 19:04.011
The prebination, I mean...

19:04.912 --> 19:06.948
oil on water has
a dampening effect.

19:07.048 --> 19:09.449
Yeah, you put a tablespoon
of olive oil in a lake.

19:09.549 --> 19:12.653
Ten minutes later,
you get acres of smooth water

19:12.754 --> 19:14.655
and the wind
just rolls right over it.

19:14.756 --> 19:16.958
You're talking about storm oil,

19:17.058 --> 19:19.927
I mean, it's been
around for centuries.

19:20.027 --> 19:23.430
It might smooth the ripples,
but it won't give you this.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.033
I'm not talking about cooking
oil, but something like it,

19:26.134 --> 19:28.669
something oil like,
but more potent.

19:28.770 --> 19:31.939
I don't know, but the point is there's
precedent for this type of phenomenon,

19:32.039 --> 19:35.743
and it comes from a process
exclusive to intelligent beings.

19:35.843 --> 19:39.312
So an alien probes the water
and leaks some kind of oil.

19:39.680 --> 19:42.449
Something beyond our technology.
I mean, look at this.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.752
It's, it's glass.

19:45.552 --> 19:46.788
We should record this.

19:46.888 --> 19:48.623
Yeah. I'll go get the equipment.

19:48.723 --> 19:50.024
Oh, dinner bell.

19:53.027 --> 19:53.961
There you go.

19:59.533 --> 20:00.802
Let go, let go, let go.

20:00.902 --> 20:02.302
Just trying to help you, man.

20:02.904 --> 20:03.905
Brother hungry.

20:23.724 --> 20:24.591
What the hell?

20:24.692 --> 20:25.626
Something wrong?

20:25.726 --> 20:26.727
Yeah, they're dead.

20:27.527 --> 20:28.996
Isn't that the point of fishing?

20:29.096 --> 20:32.399
Well, the cage is supposed
to trap them. not kill them.

20:44.578 --> 20:45.646
Rotten?

20:49.449 --> 20:50.417
No.

21:03.563 --> 21:04.564
Cooked.

21:06.033 --> 21:06.901
Yeah.

21:07.602 --> 21:08.870
Flash boiled.

21:10.071 --> 21:11.839
This could be proof of impact.

21:13.107 --> 21:15.542
An ordinal object
with enough mass

21:15.643 --> 21:19.546
to survive atmosphere burn would
have such velocity on splashdown

21:19.647 --> 21:22.750
that it would instantly
superheat the water, miles of it.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.757
Okay, let's, let's hear it.

21:33.828 --> 21:35.830
Job 41:31.

21:37.031 --> 21:40.500
He maketh the deep
to boil like a pot.

21:41.035 --> 21:44.906
He maketh the sea
like a pot of ointment.

21:48.776 --> 21:49.777
Ointment?

21:51.478 --> 21:52.545
Oil.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.751
Okay, so this is end of days,
is, is, that it?

21:56.851 --> 21:59.186
This is all
that apocalyptic bullshit,

21:59.287 --> 22:00.621
that's what you're
going to go with?

22:00.721 --> 22:02.189
You know what?
That's, that's fine.

22:02.290 --> 22:03.523
I'll submit my findings.

22:03.624 --> 22:05.059
You can submit yours

22:05.159 --> 22:08.729
and we'll see
who wins the Nobel, right?

22:10.497 --> 22:11.699
Should we get going?

22:13.167 --> 22:14.467
How much further is it?

22:16.737 --> 22:17.805
We're there.

22:20.007 --> 22:21.474
Are you sure?

22:23.576 --> 22:24.812
Positive.

22:37.925 --> 22:39.492
Start at 25 megahertz.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.195
Thirty-five,
I want to play phone tag.

22:41.796 --> 22:42.763
Copy.

22:44.665 --> 22:46.701
Thirty-five, ready when you are.

22:52.139 --> 22:53.941
Go for a launch here.

22:54.041 --> 22:54.875
Set.

22:55.176 --> 22:56.043
Set.

23:34.682 --> 23:35.916
Right.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.219
Well, we all know it's
a marathon, not a sprint.

23:39.820 --> 23:42.023
Let's take it at 20 minute intervals
descending on two's for the first round

23:42.123 --> 23:43.024
and we'll take it from there.

23:44.191 --> 23:45.860
- Got it. Cool.
- Yeah.

24:28.335 --> 24:31.839
Take into account the CML
and SGC, look at that now.

24:32.273 --> 24:36.610
Right. But the declination... I mean,
I don't think it'll matter either way.

24:39.013 --> 24:41.348
Look at her,
look how she's looking at the screen.

24:41.449 --> 24:43.150
I mean, that's
like really intense.

24:43.250 --> 24:45.619
- You ever seen the movie <i>Aliens</i>?
- Yeah.

24:45.719 --> 24:48.255
One of them was a robot. Lots of action
with robots. But I'm... you know.

24:48.956 --> 24:50.658
She works hard,
but don't let that fool you,

24:50.758 --> 24:52.093
she plays hard too.

24:52.193 --> 24:53.761
Get out of here, really?

24:53.861 --> 24:54.995
Talk about party boat.

24:56.063 --> 24:57.064
Oh.

25:11.912 --> 25:14.115
Hey, can you, uh,
can you pass me the, uh,

25:15.116 --> 25:17.051
can you pass me
that flashlight?

25:18.219 --> 25:19.220
Thank you.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.588
You need anything else?

25:23.157 --> 25:24.658
They don't need you up there?

25:24.925 --> 25:27.828
Suzu and Harper, they do
set up and preflight.

25:27.928 --> 25:30.030
I come in once the data
has been collected

25:30.131 --> 25:33.000
and analyze, interpret.

25:34.401 --> 25:35.936
Finding patterns,

25:38.038 --> 25:39.874
looking at the signs.

25:45.813 --> 25:48.015
Suzu and Harper.

25:49.150 --> 25:52.786
Whatever happened to names
like Mary or Sarah?

25:53.487 --> 25:56.090
You're more comfortable with
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John's.

25:58.159 --> 25:59.326
Naomi,

26:00.394 --> 26:04.064
there's a good Bible name,
strong willed, faithful.

26:05.065 --> 26:07.301
My mom, Presbyterian.

26:11.071 --> 26:12.439
Pentecostal.

26:13.407 --> 26:14.842
Snake handlers?

26:16.076 --> 26:20.681
Yeah, those are Mojave rattlers,
deadliest snake in America.

26:20.881 --> 26:24.451
I'd have two or three
in each hand every Sunday.

26:25.753 --> 26:29.790
And you're still alive, I'm assuming
you don't attribute it to luck.

26:32.126 --> 26:36.931
And these signs will follow
those who believe in my name,

26:37.031 --> 26:40.201
they will cast out demons,
they will take up serpents,

26:40.301 --> 26:44.205
and if they drink
anything deadly,

26:45.306 --> 26:48.175
it will by no means hurt them.

26:48.275 --> 26:49.109
Huh.

26:52.079 --> 26:54.215
You think that's smart,
tempting God like that?

27:00.154 --> 27:03.757
Only the nonbeliever's
can tempt God.

27:04.391 --> 27:09.897
The faithful only seek to prove
God by engaging in the signs.

27:10.397 --> 27:11.899
Anyone die?

27:14.501 --> 27:16.170
From my congregation?

27:17.972 --> 27:19.873
One by the snakes.

27:20.574 --> 27:23.010
Another from drinking
strychnine.

27:27.014 --> 27:28.849
They must not have had
enough faith.

27:34.555 --> 27:36.290
What about your faith?

27:36.390 --> 27:37.358
You don't believe?

27:40.394 --> 27:42.763
The idea of belief
is accepting something,

27:42.863 --> 27:44.398
even though you can't prove it.

27:44.498 --> 27:47.768
I mean, whether you believe
in God, I believe in HEBs.

27:47.868 --> 27:49.803
It's exaggerating the truth.

27:49.903 --> 27:54.041
You say <i>believe</i> but what
you mean is you hope they exist.

27:54.441 --> 27:56.944
Or hope they don't exist.

27:58.145 --> 27:59.480
Listen,

27:59.580 --> 28:01.382
I know a lot of people like you.

28:02.516 --> 28:03.484
I mean, all this.

28:04.218 --> 28:05.486
It's got to be God, right?

28:05.586 --> 28:07.421
No, it doesn't have to be.

28:07.521 --> 28:08.389
It could be nothing.

28:08.489 --> 28:09.790
Bullshit.

28:10.524 --> 28:12.526
Nothing's ever nothing
with you guys.

28:12.627 --> 28:16.096
Everything is always something
all of us here in this place

28:16.196 --> 28:18.432
at this exact time,
it has to have meaning,

28:18.532 --> 28:19.833
it's got to be something.

28:19.933 --> 28:21.101
The cross in your pocket.

28:22.369 --> 28:24.138
You don't wear it
so why keep it?

28:31.111 --> 28:33.480
Do you know what my dad told me
before he killed himself?

28:35.416 --> 28:36.917
He said the search for God

28:37.885 --> 28:40.087
is nothing but an open door
for the Devil.

28:43.924 --> 28:45.993
Naomi, come take a look at this.

28:47.928 --> 28:50.164
We're not here
for what you want.

28:50.431 --> 28:51.932
We're the ones paying the bill.

28:52.933 --> 28:55.269
We're the ones on the verge
of finding our proof.

28:55.369 --> 28:58.072
It is what it is,
not what you want it to be.

28:58.172 --> 29:00.040
Got it, customer's always right.

29:01.108 --> 29:02.409
You drive the boat.

29:02.509 --> 29:04.211
I'll analyze the data.

29:05.346 --> 29:06.380
Okay.

29:07.114 --> 29:09.116
Besides, I, uh,

29:10.150 --> 29:13.387
already found
my proof a long time ago.

29:18.626 --> 29:21.128
Looking at the duration,
though, it could be an outburst.

29:21.228 --> 29:23.097
Fine, but it's still
within Jupiter's range.

29:23.197 --> 29:26.200
In range, but you ever seen as
signal this strong from Jupiter?

29:26.300 --> 29:28.035
It's high, but I could read
it my sleep.

29:28.135 --> 29:31.138
IO dependent, source speed,
decimeter gaspers.

29:36.577 --> 29:37.945
What was that?

29:38.045 --> 29:39.346
Are you seeing this?

29:39.446 --> 29:41.014
Yeah, it's reading over here.

29:42.282 --> 29:45.319
Thirteen hundred ET saturation
plateau, at ten negative seven.

29:45.419 --> 29:47.554
Negative seven, a solar flare?

29:47.655 --> 29:49.523
From the other side
of the planet?

29:49.624 --> 29:51.925
Even a direct hit
wouldn't be this strong.

29:55.329 --> 29:57.030
Definitely not a solar flare.

29:57.131 --> 29:58.465
No, it's two discreet signals,

29:58.565 --> 30:00.033
but with the same
amplitude signature.

30:00.134 --> 30:02.069
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Shit. What, what happened?

30:02.169 --> 30:03.370
- What?
- What the hell happened?

30:03.470 --> 30:05.038
Where's Jonah,
did he cut the power?

30:05.539 --> 30:06.674
What the hell did you guys do?

30:06.775 --> 30:08.041
I thought we were
on a generator.

30:08.142 --> 30:09.076
We didn't do anything.

30:09.176 --> 30:10.911
- That wasn't you?
- No.

30:11.211 --> 30:13.046
- It wasn't us.
- What the hell?

30:13.147 --> 30:15.115
- It's everything.
- What do you mean?

30:15.215 --> 30:17.652
- Yeah. Not even my phone is working.
- My phone's not working either.

30:17.752 --> 30:20.421
- The flashlights busted, too.
- Are the batteries dead?

30:20.521 --> 30:22.690
I don't know, man.
It just went dead like everything else.

30:22.791 --> 30:24.258
We're still receiving.

30:24.659 --> 30:25.627
What?

30:25.727 --> 30:27.361
Receiving how? Everything is...

30:27.461 --> 30:28.630
This can't be right.

30:32.801 --> 30:34.368
I mean,
this is a system malfunction

30:34.468 --> 30:35.569
from the power
going out probably.

30:35.670 --> 30:37.171
Just, just wait.

30:37.271 --> 30:39.072
Harper, can we
bring up the audio?

30:39.173 --> 30:41.375
I can try,
but nothing else is working.

30:42.209 --> 30:45.412
- How is it recording?
- I mean, it's, it's there somewhere.

30:45.512 --> 30:47.347
It's obviously recording
something, we just need to find it.

30:47.448 --> 30:51.018
Oh, hold on, let me
just check this.

31:04.666 --> 31:06.400
Just turn it off
before it does it again.

31:06.500 --> 31:08.235
I'm not going to turn it
off, it's recording.

31:08.335 --> 31:10.370
- What was that?
- I don't know.

31:10.471 --> 31:12.039
Whatever it is, it's gone.

32:11.298 --> 32:12.533
Modulation lanes?

32:14.301 --> 32:15.703
Are you a spectrograph?

32:17.271 --> 32:18.640
It looks like
a specter chart to me.

32:20.140 --> 32:22.309
Well, yeah, but what could
have possibly hit this kind of range?

32:22.409 --> 32:23.410
What about all this?

32:23.510 --> 32:24.746
Maybe interference.

32:24.846 --> 32:26.748
Cyclotron maser emission.

32:26.848 --> 32:28.181
It could only be
one or the other.

32:28.282 --> 32:29.751
Either way,

32:31.585 --> 32:33.453
- this is exactly what we came out here for.
- I mean,

32:33.554 --> 32:34.622
it's undeniable.

32:48.636 --> 32:51.138
- I've never seen this frequency fluctuate.
- What? Already.

32:51.238 --> 32:52.573
We won't really
know until we get data.

32:52.674 --> 32:53.675
Yeah, but I'm...

33:00.213 --> 33:01.315
Davis?

33:09.323 --> 33:10.424
What is that?

33:10.524 --> 33:11.592
I don't know.

33:13.560 --> 33:14.461
It's tight.

33:18.465 --> 33:19.466
Heavy.

33:25.773 --> 33:27.474
Can't get it.

33:29.644 --> 33:30.845
- Grab it, grab it.
- I've got it.

33:46.593 --> 33:48.161
What is this?

33:48.261 --> 33:49.697
What do you
mean, what is this?

33:49.797 --> 33:52.399
I know what it is, okay,
but what's happening?

33:54.769 --> 33:55.870
Something hit us.

33:55.970 --> 33:57.404
This did that?

33:57.504 --> 33:59.206
- No.
- Then what?

33:59.306 --> 34:01.308
There is something down there.

34:01.408 --> 34:03.243
Something big,

34:03.343 --> 34:05.747
and let's just say
it ain't radio waves.

34:08.850 --> 34:11.819
But if the customer
ain't asking...

34:22.262 --> 34:27.401
Latitude 27.02,
longitude negative 76.77.

34:27.501 --> 34:29.169
Our current coordinates,

34:29.269 --> 34:31.438
the coordinates
of your anomaly event,

34:31.538 --> 34:34.809
which not coincidentally is just over
the cliff of the continental shelf.

34:34.909 --> 34:38.378
Now, half a mile back
the ocean floor

34:38.478 --> 34:40.380
sits a shallow
football field below us.

34:40.480 --> 34:42.817
But here, right here,
underneath our feet

34:43.383 --> 34:46.353
is a full two miles
of pitch black,

34:46.453 --> 34:48.156
so where did
that thing come from?

34:56.596 --> 34:57.497
Jesus.

35:02.369 --> 35:05.472
Jesus is confronted by a man
possessed by demons

35:05.572 --> 35:08.843
who identified themselves
as Legion, for we are many.

35:10.277 --> 35:11.746
He cast out the demons

35:11.846 --> 35:15.348
who then possessed
a nearby herd of swine.

35:17.618 --> 35:21.756
Immediately the entire herd goes
crazy and commits mass suicide

35:21.856 --> 35:25.793
by stampeding down a hillside
and off a cliff into the sea.

35:29.063 --> 35:32.633
The seas have
always belonged to him.

35:35.402 --> 35:36.704
It's his domain.

35:39.741 --> 35:41.809
Why did Jesus walk on water?

35:43.376 --> 35:46.013
To show his power
over the Devil.

35:46.114 --> 35:48.482
Moses parting the sea,
same thing.

35:49.316 --> 35:52.987
- Book of Revelation, all the Dragons and...
- Dragons?

35:53.087 --> 35:56.590
Dragons and the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse,

35:56.691 --> 35:57.725
where do they come from?

35:57.825 --> 35:59.827
They rise from the sea.

36:02.797 --> 36:05.432
- The Bermuda Triangle?
- The Devil's Triangle.

36:05.532 --> 36:10.303
This is one of the busiest
travel routes in the world.

36:10.403 --> 36:13.007
Airliners, freighters,
commercial boats

36:13.107 --> 36:15.743
travel through here
without incident every day.

36:15.843 --> 36:17.410
We're having
an incident right now.

36:18.045 --> 36:20.280
We've seen
impossible shit out there

36:20.380 --> 36:23.550
and you want to tell me
that it can only be aliens?

36:24.051 --> 36:25.753
I mean, religion or science,

36:25.853 --> 36:27.889
how is the outcome
any different?

36:28.890 --> 36:30.658
I'm sorry,
is that a real question?

36:30.758 --> 36:33.493
Nothing has changed
as far as your data goes.

36:33.593 --> 36:35.763
Something is trying
to communicate.

36:35.863 --> 36:37.397
You recorded it.

36:37.799 --> 36:40.802
Listen, everything
you came out here to do,

36:40.902 --> 36:42.637
first contact, it's here.

36:42.737 --> 36:44.705
- It's happening.
- Yes,

36:44.806 --> 36:47.507
something is happening,
but it's based in reality,

36:47.608 --> 36:50.343
not, not some, um, urban myth
or fairy tale.

36:50.945 --> 36:53.413
It is what it is, not what
you want it to be, right?

36:53.881 --> 36:55.817
I've had enough of this, okay?

36:55.917 --> 36:58.886
- Can we just get out now?
- Thank you. Yes.

36:58.986 --> 37:00.554
Wait, wait,
wait a minute.

37:01.022 --> 37:02.056
Wait a minute.

37:05.660 --> 37:07.460
Are you telling me

37:08.129 --> 37:11.531
that if this were first contact
from some alien entity,

37:11.933 --> 37:14.501
from outer space
with zero precedent

37:15.736 --> 37:18.706
defying all odds
based on your own science,

37:18.806 --> 37:21.075
odds that are
literally astronomical,

37:21.175 --> 37:23.811
that you would rush
to the press with your data?

37:23.911 --> 37:25.613
But if, on the other hand,

37:25.713 --> 37:28.015
this were a contact
from divinity,

37:28.481 --> 37:30.985
which has existed
throughout all of human history

37:31.085 --> 37:34.421
in every known society,
that you would bury it?

37:35.890 --> 37:39.894
You think that this is proof
of Christian divinity?

37:41.062 --> 37:44.598
I mean, how do we know that you're
not the one making the signs

37:44.699 --> 37:46.701
and putting
a pig in your own cage?

37:46.801 --> 37:48.803
Where would I get
a pig out here?

37:48.903 --> 37:50.771
- I don't know, you had help.
- Oh, come on, really?

37:50.872 --> 37:52.773
- You.
- I don't want this shit in my brochure.

37:52.874 --> 37:54.541
What about the power?

37:54.642 --> 37:56.777
What about the phones going out?
How did I do that?

37:56.878 --> 37:58.112
I'm not sure.

37:58.212 --> 37:59.881
But I do know
that at some point,

37:59.981 --> 38:03.150
everything, everything
can be explained.

38:03.251 --> 38:05.920
No everything that you want
to be explained.

38:06.020 --> 38:09.957
You know what? I'm sick of being
preached at by self-righteous men

38:10.057 --> 38:13.393
who were taught lies and they
think it's the only truth.

38:13.828 --> 38:15.963
Science has never lied to me.

38:16.063 --> 38:19.033
You can't say the same thing
about your priests and preachers.

38:19.133 --> 38:21.869
Ok, look
we have all the data,

38:21.969 --> 38:25.907
we have the recordings, the print
outs, everything we need for SETI.

38:26.641 --> 38:29.542
We'd like to go back now.
If you don't mind.

39:38.145 --> 39:39.947
We've been at top speed
for an hour

39:40.047 --> 39:41.548
and our coordinates
haven't changed.

39:41.649 --> 39:42.683
Phones are dead.

39:43.684 --> 39:45.686
Nothing but static on the radio
and satellite.

39:47.021 --> 39:48.689
We're just spinning our wheels.

39:52.626 --> 39:54.095
Ok.

39:54.729 --> 39:56.030
What about a different bearing?

39:59.066 --> 40:00.835
You know what,
let me check something out.

40:12.213 --> 40:14.215
- Are we getting outta here?
- Uh, no,

40:14.315 --> 40:15.850
we're burning through fuel,

40:15.950 --> 40:18.953
and somehow
we're not going anywhere.

40:21.288 --> 40:22.289
How is that even possible?

40:23.024 --> 40:24.125
I have no idea.

40:25.893 --> 40:27.795
Hey, is it true that, um,

40:28.696 --> 40:31.966
really religious people believe
that the seas belong to the Devil?

40:32.900 --> 40:33.934
I don't know.

40:34.902 --> 40:36.771
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought
you were religious.

40:36.871 --> 40:37.872
You seem to know a lot.

40:37.972 --> 40:40.241
Yeah, I was raised in it, but...

40:40.775 --> 40:41.709
Awesome.

40:43.277 --> 40:44.879
How long have you known Jonah?

40:46.213 --> 40:49.216
Two years. Met him on a dock when
I was buying this party boat.

40:49.884 --> 40:51.752
You mean
your entertainment company?

40:52.219 --> 40:53.120
Yeah.

40:54.188 --> 40:56.991
You know, I almost
ran out of my whole trust fund

40:57.091 --> 40:59.126
just doing shit like apps and

40:59.226 --> 41:01.062
- fashion startups.
- Fashion?

41:01.729 --> 41:04.698
Yeah, you know, I'm really
super successful at failing.

41:05.266 --> 41:08.903
But then I thought to myself,
party boat, college town.

41:09.770 --> 41:12.873
It was like the first time
I made any kind of money.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.943
And partly because
he likes to be on the sea

41:16.043 --> 41:17.678
and he doesn't
really care about money.

41:18.145 --> 41:20.147
- Jonah?
- Mm-hm.

41:22.283 --> 41:23.651
That's not really his name.

41:24.418 --> 41:26.954
He got it from some story
in the Bible.

41:27.655 --> 41:28.556
Do you know it?

41:30.124 --> 41:34.695
Jonah, disobeys God,
gets swallowed up by a whale,

41:35.062 --> 41:37.898
repents three days later,
gets spit back out.

41:38.933 --> 41:41.702
I mean,
it's scientifically impossible.

41:42.303 --> 41:47.174
Well, Marcus Brigman had a scuba
diving accident and drowned.

41:48.976 --> 41:51.245
Clinically dead
for exactly three minutes

41:51.345 --> 41:55.015
before he was somehow
miraculously revived.

41:56.417 --> 41:57.818
Three minutes.

41:58.385 --> 41:59.920
Going by Jonah ever since.

42:02.723 --> 42:03.891
So that's his proof.

42:05.392 --> 42:07.761
Look, I don't know
if it's his proof

42:07.862 --> 42:09.763
if he's right or he's wrong.
I don't care.

42:10.197 --> 42:12.032
I just hope that he can
get us out of this.

42:16.170 --> 42:17.304
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:17.404 --> 42:18.305
Well?

42:19.406 --> 42:22.176
Everything's working,
nothing wrong with the boat.

42:24.011 --> 42:26.914
Roman's right,
the planes, boats,

42:27.014 --> 42:29.216
they all come through here
without incident.

42:29.316 --> 42:33.220
They pass through because
they weren't brought here.

42:33.320 --> 42:34.421
From a sign?

42:34.522 --> 42:36.423
Literally a fallen star
from heaven.

42:36.524 --> 42:37.658
There's a name for that,
you know.

42:37.758 --> 42:38.859
Lucifer?

42:39.960 --> 42:42.229
The Devil's the one
communicating with us up there?

42:45.199 --> 42:46.167
Immanence.

42:48.903 --> 42:49.970
What?

42:51.005 --> 42:52.239
What is immanence?

42:53.174 --> 42:55.776
Well, God doesn't just go around
showing his face,

42:55.876 --> 42:59.713
I mean, he's transcendent,
he can only manifest himself indirectly.

43:00.214 --> 43:02.416
So God is showing us the Devil?

43:05.219 --> 43:06.687
If you see one,

43:06.787 --> 43:08.289
then you have
to believe in the other.

43:08.389 --> 43:10.090
Well, that's a dick move.

43:10.191 --> 43:12.092
And whatever happened to putting
his face on a potato chip

43:12.193 --> 43:13.827
or, or a piece of toast?

43:14.228 --> 43:16.697
Well, the Devil used to stay
out in the open,

43:17.198 --> 43:20.134
you know, and reign
with fear and horror.

43:20.234 --> 43:23.771
But he realized that's
what made true believers.

43:24.805 --> 43:26.373
So he changed tactics.

43:27.208 --> 43:28.709
He disappeared.

43:29.810 --> 43:32.246
Stayed in the shadows,
in the darkness.

43:36.450 --> 43:38.719
Eventually everyone forgot.

43:40.854 --> 43:42.122
Not just him, though.

43:43.123 --> 43:44.992
They forgot God too.

43:45.092 --> 43:46.160
It worked.

43:47.261 --> 43:49.230
Nobody believes shit anymore.

43:50.464 --> 43:53.901
Look, I really don't
care what to believe right now,

43:54.001 --> 43:55.169
I just want to get out of here.

43:55.569 --> 43:56.904
We're not moving.

43:57.905 --> 44:00.040
Is this more
snake handling for you?

44:00.140 --> 44:03.444
You can't find God, so you're
chasing around the Devil?

44:03.544 --> 44:04.878
I know both.

44:06.547 --> 44:08.182
Off the coast of Bermuda.

44:10.918 --> 44:12.353
Hundred feet down,

44:12.453 --> 44:14.021
cold, black.

44:16.423 --> 44:17.958
It's the last thing I saw.

44:20.461 --> 44:22.096
Before you died.

44:30.037 --> 44:31.905
Hey, guys.
I see a boat.

45:04.271 --> 45:05.472
Hello?

45:08.208 --> 45:09.310
Is the power out?

45:10.511 --> 45:12.379
Yeah, looks dead in the water.

45:12.980 --> 45:16.350
You really think that's the right
choice of words in this situation?

45:17.017 --> 45:19.920
Why are we stopping?
Can, can we just keep going?

45:20.622 --> 45:22.990
Doesn't matter
which direction we go into,

45:23.090 --> 45:24.224
we end up right here.

45:25.459 --> 45:28.395
Isn't this what
you came out here for?

45:28.495 --> 45:30.030
Communication?

45:31.432 --> 45:34.068
So do you make
first contact or not?

45:36.437 --> 45:38.105
You prefer a UFO?

45:39.173 --> 45:40.240
Yes.

45:43.911 --> 45:47.247
If we're going to go over there, don't you
think we should have a weapon of some kind?

45:47.348 --> 45:51.218
Uh, don't you think whatever
made this boat appear over there

45:51.318 --> 45:53.220
wouldn't just kill us
if it really wanted to?

45:53.587 --> 45:55.155
Great point.

45:56.423 --> 45:58.058
Hey, maybe it's not so bad.

45:58.325 --> 46:01.462
I mean, maybe this entity
or whatever it is,

46:01.562 --> 46:05.566
re-created, the party boat, because,
maybe it wanted to talk to us.

46:06.200 --> 46:08.535
Absolutely, absolutely.

46:08.636 --> 46:12.640
Look, the fact that this entity
chose to reveal itself

46:12.741 --> 46:16.043
using imagery that we can
understand, suggests that it's

46:16.143 --> 46:17.544
- intelligent.
- Right, right.

46:17.645 --> 46:20.514
Like it's, it's trying to
make us feel... comfortable.

46:21.448 --> 46:24.151
So, so it's not meaning
to be creepy?

46:25.219 --> 46:26.587
I didn't say that.

46:43.337 --> 46:45.406
Keep your flashlights on red.

46:45.506 --> 46:48.041
It'll keep your eyes
adjusted to the dark.

46:49.042 --> 46:52.614
Listen, if you see anything
or need anything,

46:53.414 --> 46:55.482
just blast the horn, alright?

47:16.771 --> 47:18.640
Please hurry, please.

48:56.871 --> 48:58.238
Boat's dead.

49:05.813 --> 49:06.681
Don't touch it.

49:07.347 --> 49:08.282
I didn't.

49:31.538 --> 49:35.710
<i>Consort 7004
go for harness deploy of AFT.</i>

49:38.211 --> 49:39.513
<i>As soon as you mark the flare</i>

49:39.614 --> 49:40.682
<i>back on left 40.</i>

49:41.983 --> 49:45.552
<i>Eighty-eight
header 65 call sign Odyssey.</i>

49:45.920 --> 49:47.220
Odyssey?

49:47.321 --> 49:48.155
Calling it in.

50:07.207 --> 50:08.375
You see it?

50:12.914 --> 50:17.719
<i>037, we've got a red
emergency beacon visible left 20.</i>

50:22.890 --> 50:24.224
What do you see?

50:26.961 --> 50:28.295
Nothing.

50:36.470 --> 50:37.571
<i>I see a raft.</i>

50:37.672 --> 50:39.172
There's nothing out there.

50:39.272 --> 50:40.273
<i>It's got to be all of them,</i>

50:40.374 --> 50:41.341
<i>there's nobody over here,</i>

50:41.441 --> 50:42.442
<i>it's a total Ghost town.</i>

50:42.910 --> 50:44.746
<i>How many souls aboard?</i>

50:44.846 --> 50:46.881
<i>...showing six.</i>

50:47.514 --> 50:48.783
What is this?
Are they talking about us?

51:01.729 --> 51:04.564
<i>Hold on, 04,
when was contact on this again?</i>

51:04.999 --> 51:08.235
<i>Distress
signal was activated at 23:39.</i>

51:10.337 --> 51:12.907
<i>At 11:39, roger that.</i>

51:24.619 --> 51:26.486
<i>It's a raft,
stand by for a count of survivors.</i>

51:26.586 --> 51:27.822
Do we have a raft?

51:29.523 --> 51:31.826
<i>Can't be all of them,
no way they got six people in that thing.</i>

51:31.926 --> 51:33.360
Six?

51:33.460 --> 51:35.595
- They have to be seeing us.
- who's seeing us?

51:35.697 --> 51:36.898
I don't understand
there's no one out there.

51:36.998 --> 51:39.199
- Listen.
- <i>Why in hell jump ship?</i>

51:39.299 --> 51:41.234
<i>Here we go,
got movement down there.</i>

51:41.334 --> 51:43.938
- <i>How many?</i>
- <i>Stand by, I'll have lights up</i>

51:44.038 --> 51:46.974
<i>in three, two, one.</i>

52:11.298 --> 52:15.268
<i>Here we go,
counting two that's one, two survivors.</i>

52:15.737 --> 52:17.304
<i>Got movement from both.</i>

52:21.475 --> 52:22.342
Two?

52:24.645 --> 52:25.847
Only two?

52:27.581 --> 52:29.617
<i>Sending the basket for deploy.</i>

52:43.330 --> 52:44.431
Turn it off.

52:44.832 --> 52:46.968
Pull the plug, pull the plug.

53:06.386 --> 53:07.387
Suzu?

53:16.596 --> 53:17.665
Suzu?

53:19.066 --> 53:20.067
Is that you?

53:22.837 --> 53:23.938
Suzu!

53:31.378 --> 53:32.312
Suzu!

53:36.083 --> 53:37.051
Harper.

53:37.151 --> 53:38.585
Harper, stay away from the door.

53:54.702 --> 53:56.503
Look, I don't know about y'all,

53:56.871 --> 53:57.972
but I'm for getting
the hell out of here.

54:06.647 --> 54:07.615
Oh, shit!

54:11.085 --> 54:12.954
Harper.

54:15.623 --> 54:17.091
Stop! Harper!

54:17.191 --> 54:18.993
Hey, hey, stop this!

54:19.093 --> 54:20.393
This isn't me.

54:20.493 --> 54:22.562
Harper, Harper, are you...

54:22.663 --> 54:24.632
It's an open door for the Devil.
It's an open door for the Devil.

54:24.732 --> 54:25.900
It's an open door for the Devil.

54:26.000 --> 54:27.500
It's an open door for the Devil.

54:27.601 --> 54:29.569
It's an open door for the Devil.

54:29.670 --> 54:30.838
It's an open door for the Devil.

54:30.938 --> 54:31.873
It's an open door for the Devil.

54:31.973 --> 54:32.607
It's an open door for the Devil.

54:32.707 --> 54:34.141
It's an open door for the Devil.

54:34.242 --> 54:36.443
It's an open door for the Devil.

54:36.543 --> 54:37.979
It's an open door for the Devil.

55:08.743 --> 55:09.644
Oh my God.

55:13.014 --> 55:13.881
No.

55:40.074 --> 55:42.509
Davis, don't look. Don't look!

55:43.611 --> 55:45.179
I need you to go
down to the engine room.

55:45.279 --> 55:46.714
Listen, listen,

55:46.814 --> 55:48.548
go down to the engine room.

55:48.649 --> 55:49.617
The box.

55:49.717 --> 55:50.985
Look for the EPIRB...

55:51.085 --> 55:52.552
- What? The...
- In the boxes.

55:52.653 --> 55:53.821
- The emergency beacon.
- Right.

55:54.288 --> 55:55.723
I don't think it'll be there.

55:55.823 --> 55:57.892
It'll be out on the life raft.

55:57.992 --> 55:59.093
Then why do you want me
to go down there?

55:59.193 --> 56:00.194
I need to know.

56:01.262 --> 56:04.131
- Get down there, get back.
- Okay, but what about...

56:04.231 --> 56:07.234
Don't get distracted,
you understand?

56:07.335 --> 56:09.971
- Go. Go.
- Yeah. Okay, okay, okay.

56:12.073 --> 56:13.207
This is it.

56:13.908 --> 56:15.142
I see you.

56:17.979 --> 56:20.748
It's not real,
it's not real, it's not real.

58:34.081 --> 58:35.049
Roman.

59:16.257 --> 59:18.192
Suzu, no!

59:24.231 --> 59:25.065
Suzu.

59:27.835 --> 59:28.669
Calm down.

59:28.769 --> 59:29.870
Suzu,

59:29.970 --> 59:31.238
just hold on, hold on.

59:40.347 --> 59:41.348
No.

59:43.117 --> 59:44.018
Stop.

59:57.064 --> 59:58.799
Come on!

1:00:25.226 --> 1:00:28.028
Suzu, you ok?

1:00:30.331 --> 1:00:31.799
Stay right here.

1:00:44.211 --> 1:00:46.180
Hey, Harper, Harper.

1:00:46.547 --> 1:00:47.448
Are you ok?

1:00:48.816 --> 1:00:49.883
Are you ok?

1:00:50.251 --> 1:00:52.319
- Ok, come on, come on, come on.
- Yeah.

1:00:52.419 --> 1:00:54.154
- Is she ok?
- Yeah, yeah, she's fine.

1:00:54.255 --> 1:00:55.456
- Yeah.
- Was the beacon there?

1:00:55.556 --> 1:00:56.390
No.

1:00:56.490 --> 1:00:57.324
Where's Naomi?

1:01:15.876 --> 1:01:17.077
- Help me.
- Yeah.

1:01:18.912 --> 1:01:20.447
Come on, come on, push!

1:01:21.015 --> 1:01:22.449
Yeah, I got you, I got you.
Let's...

1:01:23.817 --> 1:01:25.886
- Where's everybody else?
- They've already gone back.

1:01:26.153 --> 1:01:27.388
We've gotta
get off this boat.

1:01:27.488 --> 1:01:29.256
Jonah, let's go.

1:01:29.390 --> 1:01:31.458
What are we waiting for?
What is it?

1:01:32.126 --> 1:01:33.027
Hurry.

1:02:19.940 --> 1:02:21.542
What just happened?

1:02:22.276 --> 1:02:27.915
This has to be some
psycho sensory manipulation,

1:02:28.482 --> 1:02:33.887
some collective hallucination,
it's, it's, it's, it's not real.

1:02:37.091 --> 1:02:38.325
Everything.

1:02:43.564 --> 1:02:46.066
Everything that happened
on that other boat

1:02:48.369 --> 1:02:49.436
is going to happen here.

1:02:50.672 --> 1:02:52.439
- No. No.
- How could you possibly know that?

1:02:52.539 --> 1:02:53.374
- You don't know that.
- No, no, no.

1:03:04.686 --> 1:03:05.653
Harper, get away from the door.

1:03:08.555 --> 1:03:10.290
No, no, no, no.

1:03:34.682 --> 1:03:36.150
Don't.

1:03:42.022 --> 1:03:43.123
Don't.

1:04:11.719 --> 1:04:13.086
Mm-hmm.

1:05:37.404 --> 1:05:38.640
Do you see me?

1:05:40.642 --> 1:05:42.710
This is what you wanted.

1:05:44.111 --> 1:05:45.680
To provoke me.

1:05:48.850 --> 1:05:50.250
To see me.

1:05:50.852 --> 1:05:52.052
Again.

1:05:54.656 --> 1:05:55.823
Not like this.

1:05:57.224 --> 1:05:58.760
It's always like this.

1:06:09.469 --> 1:06:12.539
You're realizing you've been
wrong all this time.

1:06:14.374 --> 1:06:18.278
Everything you hated,
everything you mocked.

1:06:19.413 --> 1:06:20.547
It's all true.

1:06:22.482 --> 1:06:24.585
God, Jesus,

1:06:24.686 --> 1:06:26.320
the Bible.

1:06:27.220 --> 1:06:28.255
Me.

1:06:30.223 --> 1:06:31.458
It's all very real.

1:06:33.193 --> 1:06:34.595
History, in fact,

1:06:36.296 --> 1:06:39.466
and so many people knew it.

1:06:40.200 --> 1:06:43.838
Millions and millions of people
said so for centuries.

1:06:44.606 --> 1:06:47.875
Even the most pathetic
of the illiterate slaves

1:06:47.976 --> 1:06:50.444
in the so-called Dark Ages
accepted it.

1:06:50.544 --> 1:06:52.446
But oh, no, not you.

1:06:53.180 --> 1:06:58.352
No, you knew so much more
than they did, didn't you?

1:07:01.823 --> 1:07:03.223
There, now he knows.

1:07:10.230 --> 1:07:12.700
And now you see how little
that matters.

1:07:14.936 --> 1:07:17.337
No one cares what they know.

1:07:18.271 --> 1:07:20.608
They don't do what they know.

1:07:21.609 --> 1:07:23.577
They do what they want.

1:07:26.648 --> 1:07:29.583
This isn't what he wants.

1:07:29.951 --> 1:07:34.287
He wants to be part of what's
about to happen in the world.

1:07:36.824 --> 1:07:41.495
And with your mind open now, you're
ready to make your greatest discovery.

1:07:43.597 --> 1:07:44.899
In two years,

1:07:45.565 --> 1:07:49.503
you will confirm the existence
of axion particles.

1:07:58.278 --> 1:08:03.550
Dark matter, dark energy
will be measured and understood.

1:08:07.387 --> 1:08:12.325
And you and your team will
announce confirmation...

1:08:13.828 --> 1:08:15.697
of supersymmetry.

1:08:18.565 --> 1:08:23.537
The universe reveals
her every secret for you.

1:08:33.081 --> 1:08:34.381
Look at him,

1:08:34.749 --> 1:08:37.819
look at how badly
he wants it, huh?

1:08:47.327 --> 1:08:49.429
You, oh...

1:08:50.530 --> 1:08:52.365
You think you're a failure,

1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:54.769
well, you are.

1:08:55.837 --> 1:08:58.238
But one of those companies
you invested in

1:08:58.806 --> 1:09:00.507
will rise again soon,

1:09:00.608 --> 1:09:02.375
half a billion dollars
overnight.

1:09:05.312 --> 1:09:08.750
I bet you wish you knew which
company it was, huh?

1:09:09.884 --> 1:09:11.753
Well, just remember,
in three months from now,

1:09:11.853 --> 1:09:14.387
when someone makes a suggestion
to move operations up north,

1:09:14.488 --> 1:09:15.589
you say...

1:09:16.824 --> 1:09:17.658
No.

1:09:21.896 --> 1:09:25.666
Oh, your lives are so short.

1:09:27.068 --> 1:09:29.402
Just blinking
in and out of existence.

1:09:30.772 --> 1:09:34.041
After five hundred generations
I'm finally making real progress.

1:09:34.142 --> 1:09:36.878
All those hypocrites
in and out of church

1:09:36.978 --> 1:09:38.946
just pretending they
know everything,

1:09:39.046 --> 1:09:41.916
that they are everything,
and they're not.

1:09:43.818 --> 1:09:45.552
No wonder you ran away, huh?

1:09:47.521 --> 1:09:49.690
And your poor mother

1:09:50.357 --> 1:09:52.559
praying for your soul.

1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:54.962
Day in and day out

1:09:56.429 --> 1:09:59.366
when she only has a few months
left to live herself.

1:10:03.838 --> 1:10:05.305
Stage four.

1:10:16.416 --> 1:10:17.484
She didn't know.

1:10:17.752 --> 1:10:18.786
Shame on you.

1:10:20.554 --> 1:10:24.892
She doesn't want you to know because she's
afraid it will push you further away from Him.

1:10:25.760 --> 1:10:28.930
So she prays and prays and prays
for this miracle

1:10:29.030 --> 1:10:30.564
that's never going to come.

1:10:31.032 --> 1:10:32.633
Unless...

1:10:34.769 --> 1:10:36.070
you allow me to help you.

1:10:45.780 --> 1:10:46.914
For a price.

1:10:50.651 --> 1:10:53.520
Two of you will see
what the future holds

1:10:53.855 --> 1:10:55.756
when you're rescued
from the lifeboat.

1:10:58.159 --> 1:10:59.459
The other two

1:10:59.927 --> 1:11:01.929
will stay with me

1:11:03.197 --> 1:11:04.564
forever.

1:11:10.605 --> 1:11:11.639
You killed the girls.

1:11:17.845 --> 1:11:19.814
Why don't you just kill
the rest of us?

1:11:26.654 --> 1:11:27.855
I don't want the rest of you.

1:11:31.025 --> 1:11:31.692
Only you.

1:11:35.763 --> 1:11:37.397
You didn't bring us here.

1:11:39.100 --> 1:11:43.771
So you don't know what happens,
only He knows how this ends.

1:11:50.543 --> 1:11:52.179
Here's my final offer, kids,

1:11:53.047 --> 1:11:55.448
three of you will get
a once in a lifetime deal,

1:11:55.548 --> 1:11:59.053
I will take only one of you if the
only one of you, is you, Jonah.

1:12:03.858 --> 1:12:05.059
Wait, what?

1:12:05.159 --> 1:12:06.928
Offer expires 11:39.

1:12:16.603 --> 1:12:18.739
He won't let you do it yourself,
will he?

1:12:23.510 --> 1:12:25.646
You're just another snake.

1:12:39.026 --> 1:12:42.595
He must want you really badly
if he brought us together again.

1:13:49.797 --> 1:13:51.932
- Are they?
- Yeah.

1:13:52.033 --> 1:13:53.034
Oh God.

1:13:55.336 --> 1:13:57.605
Hey, is that it?

1:13:57.705 --> 1:13:58.906
He didn't do it.

1:14:00.141 --> 1:14:02.810
He got exactly
what he came here for.

1:14:04.311 --> 1:14:08.548
Well, he told us to kill you.

1:14:10.718 --> 1:14:14.088
And just like that,
you're a true believer.

1:14:14.822 --> 1:14:17.925
Well, you're not exactly
in a position to judge, huh?

1:14:18.626 --> 1:14:22.029
I mean, you out of everyone
should reject what he said.

1:14:22.129 --> 1:14:23.964
And you have every reason
to accept it.

1:14:24.065 --> 1:14:26.834
Look we don't have time
to argue.

1:14:28.369 --> 1:14:31.705
On the other boat
we all heard the radio chatter.

1:14:32.106 --> 1:14:35.342
I looked out the window
and I saw the flashing beacon.

1:14:35.443 --> 1:14:38.279
- We didn't see a beacon.
- Not yet. But it will be there.

1:14:38.379 --> 1:14:39.680
Okay, but maybe it won't happen.

1:14:39.780 --> 1:14:40.881
He didn't do it.

1:14:40.981 --> 1:14:42.850
Because he doesn't, we do.

1:14:42.950 --> 1:14:44.584
- No, I don't.
- I wouldn't.

1:14:44.685 --> 1:14:45.820
I don't want your blood
on my hands.

1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:47.121
We wouldn't. But we do.

1:14:47.221 --> 1:14:48.322
We can choose not to.

1:14:48.422 --> 1:14:49.790
But we don't.

1:14:49.890 --> 1:14:50.891
Bullshit.

1:14:51.792 --> 1:14:53.961
You can't know that.
We have a choice.

1:14:54.061 --> 1:14:57.597
We can, we can choose not to go
on the raft and, and stay here.

1:14:57.698 --> 1:14:59.100
What? And risk him coming back?

1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:02.136
I'm telling you,
I saw the beacon.

1:15:03.671 --> 1:15:05.973
It's not about what
has to happen.

1:15:06.073 --> 1:15:07.041
For us,

1:15:08.676 --> 1:15:10.311
it's what will happen.

1:15:11.378 --> 1:15:13.180
Are you saying it's a prophecy?

1:15:13.781 --> 1:15:17.751
I'm not going to argue theological
fatalism with you. It's...

1:15:18.152 --> 1:15:22.656
So, are you going to choose
to stand there until 11:39

1:15:23.757 --> 1:15:25.226
and wait to see what happens?

1:15:28.362 --> 1:15:29.363
Look, you guys, we know,

1:15:30.965 --> 1:15:31.999
we know

1:15:33.200 --> 1:15:36.904
that the survivors are found
on the raft with the beacon.

1:15:38.439 --> 1:15:42.776
Does anyone else here know
how to deploy the raft

1:15:42.877 --> 1:15:44.411
or work the beacon?

1:15:45.913 --> 1:15:48.649
It's amazing how his prophecy makes
him one of the only two survivors.

1:15:54.421 --> 1:15:56.790
The key to the padlock
for the raft.

1:16:01.795 --> 1:16:03.063
You're the gatekeeper now.

1:16:03.831 --> 1:16:07.168
Davis and I only
go down to the engine room

1:16:07.268 --> 1:16:09.103
and get the emergency beacon.

1:16:09.503 --> 1:16:15.009
No way for only two of us
to have the raft and the beacon.

1:16:16.143 --> 1:16:19.180
Everyone needs everybody else.

1:16:21.248 --> 1:16:22.116
Agreed?

1:16:22.216 --> 1:16:23.117
Agreed.

1:16:24.118 --> 1:16:25.052
Okay.

1:16:25.519 --> 1:16:26.787
Yeah.

1:16:42.436 --> 1:16:44.205
It's in the front,
do you need me to show you?

1:16:44.305 --> 1:16:45.239
I got it.

1:17:07.261 --> 1:17:08.896
Okay, the beacon's right there.

1:17:09.263 --> 1:17:11.131
- Here you go.
- Okay, now listen,

1:17:11.232 --> 1:17:13.734
on the other boat
that beacon wasn't there,

1:17:13.834 --> 1:17:15.202
but this Bible was.

1:17:15.803 --> 1:17:17.304
I mean, it was just there,
it was laying there.

1:17:17.972 --> 1:17:20.241
It then opened
to the book of Jonah.

1:17:21.008 --> 1:17:22.443
Look at this, right there.

1:17:23.344 --> 1:17:25.746
- What are...
- Okay listen, Naomi,

1:17:26.247 --> 1:17:27.448
they had to choose.

1:17:28.683 --> 1:17:31.218
Jonah was on a ship, the ship
was in this unnatural storm.

1:17:31.318 --> 1:17:32.953
Everybody was going to die,
and they knew it

1:17:33.053 --> 1:17:36.423
because God was angry
with Jonah for running away.

1:17:37.491 --> 1:17:39.793
So they had to make a choice.

1:17:57.111 --> 1:17:58.078
Look at this.

1:17:58.545 --> 1:17:59.780
They took up Jonah

1:18:00.214 --> 1:18:02.883
and cast him forth into the sea

1:18:02.983 --> 1:18:05.786
and the waters ceased raging.

1:18:06.353 --> 1:18:07.488
That's it, Naomi.

1:18:08.255 --> 1:18:09.990
It is exactly what he said.

1:18:10.090 --> 1:18:12.426
If we give up Jonah,
then, then that's it.

1:18:12.526 --> 1:18:13.927
That's enough, it's, it's over.

1:18:15.329 --> 1:18:17.298
On the other boat,
I was supposed to see this,

1:18:17.398 --> 1:18:19.366
you know, and I wouldn't have
if I didn't get hit in the face

1:18:19.466 --> 1:18:21.001
with the, the pipe burst and...

1:18:24.405 --> 1:18:25.806
Page 1139.

1:18:47.361 --> 1:18:50.364
Look at this, Marcus Brigman
was in a scuba diving accident

1:18:50.464 --> 1:18:52.533
on August 17th
off the coast of Bermuda.

1:18:53.100 --> 1:18:56.003
Paramedics pronounced
him dead at 11:39.

1:18:59.440 --> 1:19:01.942
That's what all those clocks were
trying to tell us over there.

1:19:02.943 --> 1:19:04.144
He's the one that got away.

1:19:06.513 --> 1:19:09.450
It's Jonah's time, literally.

1:19:16.357 --> 1:19:18.392
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

1:19:25.032 --> 1:19:26.500
All those clocks
on the other ship,

1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:27.868
it's about him.

1:19:28.502 --> 1:19:30.371
This is why 11:39.

1:19:39.513 --> 1:19:41.382
What is it that Jonah
kept saying to us?

1:19:42.717 --> 1:19:44.451
That we have to do everything
in the prophesy,

1:19:45.519 --> 1:19:46.920
everything.

1:19:51.091 --> 1:19:52.025
Do you see?

1:19:53.327 --> 1:19:56.096
If we give up Jonah,
that's enough.

1:20:28.295 --> 1:20:32.065
The raft has
ballast pockets underneath,

1:20:32.566 --> 1:20:34.669
but it wouldn't hurt to have
a little more weight

1:20:34.769 --> 1:20:36.170
and deeper down.

1:20:38.706 --> 1:20:40.240
I didn't unlock the raft.

1:20:45.279 --> 1:20:46.580
I hid the keys.

1:20:48.616 --> 1:20:49.983
Smart.

1:20:51.185 --> 1:20:53.987
If you're not on it
then nobody is.

1:20:54.555 --> 1:20:56.658
Well, the three of us will be.

1:21:02.296 --> 1:21:03.997
I didn't want it
to be like this, man.

1:21:05.566 --> 1:21:06.734
I'm sorry.

1:21:08.703 --> 1:21:10.103
I understand.

1:21:23.484 --> 1:21:26.386
Roman, Roman.

1:22:03.858 --> 1:22:04.759
Shit!

1:22:05.526 --> 1:22:06.593
Roman hid the keys.

1:22:07.762 --> 1:22:10.597
- We can't do this.
- We have to.

1:22:10.698 --> 1:22:12.266
This isn't how
it's supposed to be.

1:22:12.366 --> 1:22:14.067
This is exactly what
it's supposed to be.

1:22:14.601 --> 1:22:16.638
This is what happens, we choose.

1:22:17.705 --> 1:22:19.306
We choose.

1:22:20.140 --> 1:22:22.109
Now look the hacksaw
is in the toolbox.

1:22:22.209 --> 1:22:25.112
There's rope,
just, just to tie him up.

1:22:25.212 --> 1:22:26.313
I'll be back.

1:23:10.390 --> 1:23:11.626
Jonah, Jonah.

1:23:19.634 --> 1:23:20.534
Davis.

1:23:21.401 --> 1:23:22.804
He went to get a hacksaw.

1:23:25.172 --> 1:23:25.840
How much time?

1:23:25.940 --> 1:23:27.474
Not much time.

1:23:28.710 --> 1:23:30.110
What are you going to do?

1:23:34.882 --> 1:23:36.116
Come on.

1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:47.361
What the...

1:23:50.430 --> 1:23:51.298
Davis, no.

1:23:54.669 --> 1:23:56.203
I was in the cage.

1:23:58.472 --> 1:23:59.539
What?

1:23:59.641 --> 1:24:00.775
What's that supposed
to mean?

1:24:01.241 --> 1:24:03.645
It means it's supposed to be me.

1:24:03.745 --> 1:24:05.212
I'm the one that stays.

1:26:17.145 --> 1:26:18.613
You cut through yet?

1:26:19.412 --> 1:26:20.681
I'm working on it.

1:26:46.506 --> 1:26:47.842
Help me, God, help me, God.

1:26:58.518 --> 1:26:59.419
Davis!

1:27:00.453 --> 1:27:01.555
Almost there!

1:27:02.824 --> 1:27:03.691
Hurry!

1:27:14.702 --> 1:27:16.603
Come on, come on!

1:27:24.111 --> 1:27:25.012
I got it.
