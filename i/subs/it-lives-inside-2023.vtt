Where are you going?

46:00.400 --> 46:05.500
[whispering voice]
Samidha... Samidha...

46:08.410 --> 46:10.500
[whispering voice]
Samidha...

46:12.590 --> 46:14.980
[whispering voice]
Samidha...

46:28.350 --> 46:30.390
[chain-links rattling]

46:34.130 --> 46:35.690
[ominous music]

46:35.890 --> 46:37.270
[growling sounds]

46:53.330 --> 46:55.370
[shaky breathing]

47:00.730 --> 47:04.120
[shaky breathing]

47:11.390 --> 47:13.430
[distant screams]

47:16.180 --> 47:17.220
[Russ grunts]

47:22.970 --> 47:23.920
- [screaming]
- Oh!

47:32.110 --> 47:37.460
[screaming]

48:05.530 --> 48:06.490
[muffled voices]

48:09.270 --> 48:12.000
[Inesh] Sam... Sam...
Hey, look at me.

48:12.200 --> 48:14.320
Here. Come here.

48:16.930 --> 48:19.980
[sirens wailing]

48:38.740 --> 48:40.770
I don't even know
who she is anymore.

48:40.970 --> 48:43.900
This is our Samidha.
She's a good kid.

48:44.100 --> 48:45.470
What are you even saying?

48:45.670 --> 48:48.400
She won't even tell us
what happened.

49:06.420 --> 49:10.940
[shaky breathing]
[heart pounding]

50:44.300 --> 50:46.130
[screaming]

50:56.050 --> 50:57.440
Oh, God...

50:58.830 --> 51:00.780
I don't know what we're
even doing here anymore.

51:00.980 --> 51:02.010
What? We're talking--

51:03.010 --> 51:04.010
I mean, here.

51:04.360 --> 51:06.450
We're at home.

51:06.710 --> 51:07.760
Home?

51:09.150 --> 51:11.500
Did you see how
they looked at us?

51:12.410 --> 51:14.590
[stairs creaking]

51:17.330 --> 51:20.070
Where are you going?
Come here.

51:34.220 --> 51:37.420
Look, Samidha... Sam...

51:37.620 --> 51:41.380
We're not... we're not angry
with you.

51:41.580 --> 51:43.750
We just want to understand.

51:46.140 --> 51:47.580
Can I go to school, please?

51:48.880 --> 51:50.580
No, Sam...

51:51.060 --> 51:51.920
She won't tell us anything.

51:52.120 --> 51:52.790
Poorna...

51:52.990 --> 51:53.800
I don't...

51:56.800 --> 51:58.200
You wouldn't understand.

51:59.070 --> 52:02.070
You're right.
We don't.

52:02.420 --> 52:04.030
Please, Sam.

52:05.810 --> 52:08.950
The boy died.
This is serious.

52:12.520 --> 52:13.780
Don't bother, Inesh.

52:14.910 --> 52:16.220
She won't tell us anything.

52:17.300 --> 52:20.870
And why would she?
We're nothing to her.

52:43.680 --> 52:44.720
[sobbing]

52:52.990 --> 52:56.040
[ominous music]

53:00.350 --> 53:02.390
[rain pattering]

53:12.920 --> 53:15.970
[distant sobbing]

53:45.870 --> 53:47.440
Mom?

53:49.090 --> 53:51.140
[fly buzzing]

53:53.490 --> 53:54.880
Shame.

53:58.800 --> 54:00.190
Shame.

54:11.240 --> 54:13.510
[fly buzzing]

54:16.290 --> 54:17.640
Shame.

54:25.470 --> 54:26.430
[crashing]

54:28.780 --> 54:30.830
[gasping]

54:33.480 --> 54:35.700
[dramatic music]

54:50.800 --> 54:52.720
[dramatic music heightens]

55:05.430 --> 55:07.470
[Poorna crying]

55:17.310 --> 55:23.050
[screaming]

55:53.390 --> 55:55.830
Hey... are you alright?

55:57.000 --> 55:58.770
I heard about Russ.
I'm so sorry.

55:58.970 --> 55:59.690
I didn't hurt him.

55:59.890 --> 56:01.270
No, I know. I just...

56:03.400 --> 56:05.180
Sam, you okay?

56:06.620 --> 56:09.710
I'm gonna tell you something
and I need you to believe me.

56:12.150 --> 56:14.310
Yeah, of course.
Cross my heart and all that.

56:14.510 --> 56:15.800
What's going on?

56:16.590 --> 56:19.660
The cops think an animal
killed Russ.

56:19.860 --> 56:21.190
But I was there.

56:21.390 --> 56:23.240
It wasn't an animal,
it was something else.

56:25.420 --> 56:30.380
Whatever it is...
I think it took Tamira.

56:32.910 --> 56:34.430
Why are you whispering?

56:35.390 --> 56:36.820
It's listening.

56:38.350 --> 56:42.820
Um... tell me again, what is...
what is this thing?

56:43.020 --> 56:44.910
I don't know what it is.

56:45.110 --> 56:46.950
Like sometimes it's there
but then it's not there at all.

56:47.150 --> 56:51.010
And... and it shows me things in
my dreams but they feel so real.

56:51.360 --> 56:52.910
Okay. Sam...

56:53.110 --> 56:54.650
you look like you haven't
slept in days

56:54.850 --> 56:56.610
and lack of sleep can
cause hallucinations...

56:56.810 --> 57:00.270
Joyce... this is real.

57:00.470 --> 57:02.880
It's infected my mind.

57:03.080 --> 57:05.010
It's like everything I wanted
outside of me is inside of me

57:05.210 --> 57:06.510
and I can't get it out.

57:12.860 --> 57:16.560
What... what do you mean?
How can I help you?

57:20.560 --> 57:23.130
That's... what's after me.

57:23.520 --> 57:26.380
I... I looked all over and I...

57:26.580 --> 57:28.600
I... I can't... but I can't
find anything.

57:28.800 --> 57:29.910
There's nothing.

57:30.110 --> 57:33.100
Okay. Text that to me
and I'll look into it.

57:34.050 --> 57:36.610
I'm doing you this favor,
now you do me one.

57:36.810 --> 57:38.260
Just take it easy tonight.

57:38.460 --> 57:41.440
Lay low and tomorrow I'd like
to introduce you to someone...

57:41.640 --> 57:42.660
I'm not crazy.

57:42.860 --> 57:46.550
I know, but you're also not
alone and...

57:48.810 --> 57:51.360
I know it might seem like
there's no one

57:51.560 --> 57:56.120
on the whole planet that gets
you or... is trying to get you.

57:58.470 --> 58:01.290
There are people that love you
that care about you...

58:01.490 --> 58:04.430
[Joyce's voice begins to fade]

58:18.880 --> 58:19.880
Sam?

58:20.880 --> 58:23.970
[Joyce] Sam? Sam?

58:25.710 --> 58:27.320
Are you still with me?

58:29.760 --> 58:30.920
[growling]

58:31.120 --> 58:32.240
[screaming]

58:33.640 --> 58:38.290
[panicked breathing]

59:27.860 --> 59:30.560
[ominous music]

59:34.830 --> 59:37.660
[phone buzzing]

59:38.570 --> 59:40.430
Hey. Are you alright?

59:40.630 --> 59:42.080
You ran off and I didn't know
if I was...

59:42.280 --> 59:43.490
[Samidha] Yeah, I'm fine.

59:44.750 --> 59:49.570
Okay. Well... I heard back
about that painting.

59:49.770 --> 59:51.530
What'd you find?

59:51.730 --> 59:54.630
[Joyce] Look, I'm only telling
you this because you asked.

59:56.540 --> 59:58.930
In East Indian mythology
there's a demonic entity

59:59.130 --> 01:00:00.970
that feeds on negative energy.

01:00:01.170 --> 01:00:03.250
It's called the Pishach.

01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:07.730
[Joyce] It's a flesh eater.
A devourer of souls.

01:00:09.300 --> 01:00:13.030
You have to trap it in a vessel,
a sort of container,

01:00:13.230 --> 01:00:14.950
and then keep it there.

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:17.300
[Samidha] A vessel?

01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:21.160
[Joyce] Swamis would
sometimes take on the burden
of becoming vessels.

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:24.650
But any container could be
a vessel.

01:00:24.850 --> 01:00:29.880
Tamira found it trapped...
trapped inside a jar.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.320
Sam, did you hear these
stories growing up?

01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:35.540
From your parents maybe?

01:00:36.280 --> 01:00:38.270
[Joyce] Do you think all the
stress from the last few days

01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:39.750
- has brought these stories back?
- [Samidha] I gotta go.

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.590
[Joyce] Hey, hold on. Sam...

01:00:44.290 --> 01:00:45.900
Do you need me to come by?

01:00:51.770 --> 01:00:54.550
Look... you came to me
for help.

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:56.040
So let me help you.

01:01:05.310 --> 01:01:06.400
[Samidha] Yeah.

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:11.790
Okay. Send me your address.
I'll be right there.

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.670
[Joyce] Stay safe, Sam.

01:02:01.230 --> 01:02:05.670
[crying]

01:02:35.790 --> 01:02:38.270
I... I wanna tell you
the truth.

01:02:39.190 --> 01:02:40.300
Then, tell me.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.140
You're not gonna believe me.

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:45.060
Samidha, I'm trying.

01:02:57.420 --> 01:03:01.510
Talk to me.
Please, Sam.

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:14.640
When Tamira and I were kids...

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.880
you used to tell us those
stories that the ayahs told you.

01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:28.930
What is the Pishach, Mom?

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:32.090
Samidha-

01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:34.370
Please... tell me.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:39.250
The ayah said...

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:43.640
never to sleep with a bad
feeling in our hearts.

01:03:45.730 --> 01:03:48.820
Because there's a dark thing
that feeds on those feelings.

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:56.610
Anger... hatred... loneliness.

01:03:58.480 --> 01:03:59.440
How?

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:01.880
It needs to...

01:04:02.750 --> 01:04:04.530
What's the word?

01:04:05.970 --> 01:04:10.450
Tenderize the soul by attacking
your sanity.

01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:15.460
By isolating you from those
who love you.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.180
[growling sounds]

01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:19.330
And if anyone tries
to help you...

01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.210
It will hurt them.

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:40.310
I know I sound crazy.

01:04:41.830 --> 01:04:43.000
But it's real.

01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:48.660
All those stories that the ayahs
told you... they're real.

01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:53.580
I think it started with Karan.

01:04:54.490 --> 01:04:56.930
Dad said that family
was running.

01:04:57.710 --> 01:05:00.630
What if they brought it back
to that house?

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:03.660
And that's where
Tamira found it...

01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:05.330
trapped inside the jar.

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.600
Could she still be alive, Mom?

01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:15.080
The Pishach doesn't kill you
right away.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:20.390
It eats you slowly over time.

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:26.960
When it's ready...
it eats your soul.

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:38.260
She's been gone
since Thursday, right?

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:40.840
No. Friday.

01:05:44.410 --> 01:05:48.370
Seven. Seven days.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:54.770
Tamira's gonna die tonight, Mom.

01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:59.240
What do we... what do we do?
I have to do something.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.470
Samidha...

01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:05.990
"If you face a Pishach alone,

01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:09.530
you won't come out alive."

01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:14.880
Your soul will burn from within
until there's nothing left.

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:20.410
What do we do?

01:06:23.630 --> 01:06:25.280
I have to do something, Mom.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.510
What are you doing?

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:45.260
To summon a dark spirit
we must make an offering.

01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:50.260
We don't have meat, but
we'll offer what we can.

01:06:53.350 --> 01:06:55.010
[sighs]

01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:16.590
You can do this.

01:07:44.270 --> 01:07:46.230
[growling sounds]

01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:50.450

01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:31.800
[screaming]

01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:37.670
Karan must've died trapping it
in that jar but he did trap it.

01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:39.380
He must've written down how.

01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:42.420
I've seen this before.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.630
It's a shanti prayer.

01:11:44.830 --> 01:11:47.470
A call for peace
from the stars and seas.

01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.740
Most importantly within you.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:55.480
This has to be it.
Read it, Mom.

01:11:56.180 --> 01:12:02.470
