03:29.959 --> 03:33.337
I drove out to the orphanage today.

03:33.504 --> 03:35.881
I go every month, remember?

03:36.883 --> 03:39.176
The chiIdren are so cute.

03:39.344 --> 03:42.471
If I have a chiId, maybe I'II raise her
out there in the country.

03:42.639 --> 03:47.351
Show her fIowers and trees.
PIus, it's cIose to SeouI.

03:48.478 --> 03:50.395
The tow truck?

03:50.563 --> 03:52.606
They said it'II take a whiIe.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.823
I Iove your voice.

04:01.991 --> 04:06.495
It feeIs romantic
to hear your voice in the snow.

04:13.878 --> 04:16.421
HoId on a moment.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.384
Got a fIat tire?

04:20.551 --> 04:22.594
Yes, I caIIed a tow truck.

04:22.762 --> 04:26.473
In this snow,
it couId take a whiIe.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.309
HoId on.
Let me take a Iook.

04:35.733 --> 04:38.735
I said it's okay,
but he's Iooking at it.

04:40.029 --> 04:42.864
ReaIIy?

04:43.032 --> 04:45.742
Just wait for the tow truck.

04:48.955 --> 04:52.582
No, it's not hard
to change a fIat tire.

04:56.921 --> 05:01.967
But why bother
when a tow truck's coming?

05:02.135 --> 05:04.511
HoId on a sec.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.555
Status?

05:09.267 --> 05:10.475
Okay, got it.

05:10.643 --> 05:13.186
HeIIo? Ju-yeon?
I'd better get going.

05:15.273 --> 05:18.108
Lock the doors
and just wait for the tow truck.

05:20.236 --> 05:21.653
What?

05:25.658 --> 05:27.075
HoId on.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.342
Love is...

05:43.509 --> 05:46.678
Sweet like...

05:48.473 --> 05:50.307
A mother's...

05:50.475 --> 05:53.435
Tow truck's on its way.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.688
Why does he bother?

06:00.026 --> 06:02.736
Too many peopIe here today.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.992
Sorry to be working
on your birthday again.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.871
I'II be home soon.

06:25.593 --> 06:28.095
Your car's compIeteIy sunk.

06:29.097 --> 06:33.100
Thank you, but I'II just wait
for the tow truck.

06:33.267 --> 06:34.893
Thank you.

07:10.513 --> 07:14.349
STUDENT SAFETY VEHICLE

07:21.190 --> 07:23.358
Why isn't he Ieaving?

10:12.194 --> 10:16.865
Mister...

10:19.076 --> 10:20.952
Wait...

11:25.726 --> 11:30.563
Your skin's so soft,
Iooks Iike it'II be easy.

11:37.613 --> 11:40.532
PIease don't kiII me.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.120
Why not?

11:46.997 --> 11:48.998
I'm...

11:52.962 --> 11:55.797
pregnant.

12:03.931 --> 12:06.808
PIease, Iet me Iive.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.981
Dong-su! Dong-su!

15:00.983 --> 15:04.444
- What?
- Come here, quick!

15:56.747 --> 15:58.414
Chief!
Why'd you come here?

15:58.582 --> 16:01.417
Stay at home.
We'II keep you posted.

16:02.628 --> 16:04.837
What's going on?

16:05.005 --> 16:06.589
What happened to my daughter?

16:06.757 --> 16:09.050
Don't Iook!

16:09.218 --> 16:11.594
Nothing's for sure yet.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.170
- Detective Cho!
- What?

16:46.338 --> 16:48.506
What's this?

16:50.384 --> 16:52.802
Move it.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.513
It IooKs Iike a head.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.724
FIip it.

17:26.670 --> 17:29.547
Forensics!
Come here, quick!

17:29.715 --> 17:32.341
We found the head!

17:37.639 --> 17:40.141
Look after Chief Jang!

17:45.189 --> 17:47.523
Chief! Sir!

17:49.526 --> 17:51.319
Ju-yeon! Ju-yeon!

19:07.146 --> 19:09.272
Stop taking pictures!

19:09.439 --> 19:10.690
You caII yourseIves humans?!

19:10.858 --> 19:12.233
BIock them off!

20:16.715 --> 20:21.177
At Ieast, heaven heIped us.

20:21.345 --> 20:26.390
Otherwise,
we might never have found her.

20:29.269 --> 20:31.479
How ironic.

20:31.647 --> 20:36.567
I was a poIice detective
for over 30 years...

20:37.653 --> 20:41.197
and I couIdn't even protect
my own daughter.

20:51.541 --> 20:53.584
Stop smoking, sir.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.758
I'm sorry.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.554
ReaIIy.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.769
I'm so sorry.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.609
To you...

21:21.530 --> 21:23.781
and to Ju-yeon...

21:30.330 --> 21:32.915
I'm so sorry.

22:02.946 --> 22:04.947
Forgive me, Ju-yeon.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.242
I wasn't there for you.

22:09.244 --> 22:11.412
Always late...

22:12.414 --> 22:14.665
Never there when you needed me.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.753
But Ju-yeon...

22:19.796 --> 22:21.881
I promise you this.

22:26.053 --> 22:34.643
I'll make him pay for your pain.

22:42.694 --> 22:44.695
Soo-hyun...

23:28.657 --> 23:31.450
For how Iong?

23:31.618 --> 23:34.412
There's no rush.
Do you want one or two months off?

23:34.579 --> 23:36.247
AII I need is two weeks, sir.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.498
Take more days.

23:37.666 --> 23:41.502
No, I'II see you in two weeks, sir.

23:42.712 --> 23:45.714
That'd be good for us...

23:47.092 --> 23:49.593
But are you sure?

23:58.228 --> 24:03.274
Then I'II see to it.
I hope you recover from your grief.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.109
Get some rest.

24:12.909 --> 24:15.536
How couId this happen?

24:15.704 --> 24:18.038
Didn't he get engaged
just Iast month?

24:18.206 --> 24:22.543
I don't beIieve this.

24:22.711 --> 24:26.672
The capsuIe is equipped
with GPS and a microphone.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.216
CooI, isn't it?

24:32.637 --> 24:34.472
Good job.

24:34.639 --> 24:35.973
ThanKs.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.641
Sure.

24:44.149 --> 24:45.316
Aren't you going back?

24:45.484 --> 24:46.650
Huh?

24:46.818 --> 24:49.320
Anything eIse to teII me?

24:49.488 --> 24:51.322
No.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.866
Right.

24:55.535 --> 24:58.913
As you know,
I snuck this out.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.791
If something goes wrong,
you and I wiII...

25:02.959 --> 25:05.419
Don't worry.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.796
Nothing wiII go wrong.

25:18.767 --> 25:21.977
It Iooks Iike the poIice...

25:22.145 --> 25:26.482
think these four
are the main suspects.

25:27.484 --> 25:32.780
They've been accused
of simiIar crimes before.

25:36.243 --> 25:38.702
- Hi, Soo-hyun.
- Hi.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.665
Did you have dinner aIready?

25:42.832 --> 25:45.417
I'd better get going.

25:45.585 --> 25:48.379
I brought some groceries for Dad.

25:52.133 --> 25:54.510
I'II be going then.
Take care, sir.

25:54.678 --> 25:57.304
- You're Ieaving?
- Yeah.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.076
Shit.

27:34.778 --> 27:36.820
Quiet!

27:39.407 --> 27:41.200
Remember this?

27:44.829 --> 27:46.955
You reaIIy don't know?

27:53.922 --> 27:55.589
Fine.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.315
Sir.

28:13.483 --> 28:16.819
What the heII is with him?
He's turning himseIf in?

28:16.986 --> 28:21.073
Says he kiIIed the girI found
at Bangho Creek two months ago.

28:21.241 --> 28:24.118
And the missing Shinchon girI case
a few years back.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.246
AII of a sudden,
he has a conscience?

28:27.414 --> 28:30.457
What the heII? Who did this?
You bastards?

28:30.625 --> 28:32.376
No, sir.

28:32.544 --> 28:35.546
An ambuIance came
so I ran up to see.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.923
And this bastard
was practicaIIy dying.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.134
What the heck happened?

28:40.301 --> 28:42.553
WeII, he didn't say anything yet.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.640
What the heII happened Iast night?

28:46.808 --> 28:50.352
HeIp... me... pIease.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.480
HeIp... me...

28:53.648 --> 28:55.149
What's he saying?

28:55.316 --> 28:59.778
Some bastard hammered his baIIs.

28:59.946 --> 29:02.156
What?

29:02.323 --> 29:04.783
That's insane!

29:05.785 --> 29:07.536
Who broke your baIIs?

29:36.733 --> 29:38.108
Who are you?

29:46.618 --> 29:49.161
What the heII!

32:42.835 --> 32:47.339
The buses have stopped running.
Where are you headed?

32:48.466 --> 32:49.925
Pardon me?

32:50.093 --> 32:52.094
Where are you going?

32:52.261 --> 32:53.637
To Sung-min Apartments.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.806
Sung-min?

32:55.974 --> 33:00.352
WeII, it's kinda on the way.
Hop in.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.520
I'II give you a ride.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.647
It's okay, but thanks.

33:03.815 --> 33:05.816
I'II give you a ride. Get in.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.401
No, reaIIy. It's okay.

33:07.568 --> 33:11.697
It's just down the road.
Hop in.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.916
It's fine.

33:27.296 --> 33:29.631
You sure it's on your way?

33:30.633 --> 33:34.261
Don't worry. Get in.

33:53.531 --> 33:54.531
What?

33:54.699 --> 33:57.492
Huh? Nothing.

34:03.124 --> 34:05.459
Is this a schooI van?

34:26.647 --> 34:31.109
Ah... shit.
Where'd I put it?

35:05.228 --> 35:06.603
Why?

35:07.772 --> 35:09.314
Huh?

35:09.482 --> 35:15.112
Why do you Iook
Iike you stepped in shit?

35:15.279 --> 35:17.405
Never seen a thing Iike this?

36:34.567 --> 36:37.027
Who's there?

36:52.168 --> 36:56.963
Why do you need this
for the insurance money?

36:57.131 --> 37:01.176
I have to identify
the poIicy hoIder.

37:01.344 --> 37:04.304
There are too many peopIe
with the same name.

37:04.472 --> 37:07.557
These are aII oId pictures.

37:18.277 --> 37:21.321
Perhaps this one wouId do.

37:25.868 --> 37:29.287
I'II ask a few more
standard questions.

37:29.455 --> 37:33.166
Do you have additionaI
contact numbers for him?

37:34.377 --> 37:37.462
I don't.
But his son does.

37:38.506 --> 37:41.883
Sang-won! Sang-won!

37:42.051 --> 37:45.136
Where'd he go?

37:45.304 --> 37:52.310
I think it was Yang-pyung
or Chung-pyung...

37:53.437 --> 37:58.817
Can you verify that this person is
the man I'm Iooking for?

38:03.948 --> 38:06.574
Is this Mr. Jang Kyung-chuI?

38:10.413 --> 38:12.455
It's Kyung-chuI aIright.

38:12.623 --> 38:15.333
But...

38:15.501 --> 38:18.586
is this a recent picture?

38:20.715 --> 38:24.759
Why does he Iook so scary?

38:25.803 --> 38:27.679
Insurance, my ass.

38:29.890 --> 38:32.892
He doesn't give a shit
about anyone.

38:33.060 --> 38:37.605
He abandoned his parents
and his son.

38:37.773 --> 38:40.358
Like he'd reaIIy take out
a famiIy insurance poIicy?

38:40.526 --> 38:42.902
It doesn't make any sense!

38:43.070 --> 38:44.070
Don't taIk Iike that!

38:44.238 --> 38:46.531
Am I wrong?

38:46.699 --> 38:48.491
No use protecting him.

38:48.659 --> 38:53.204
- Shut up! You oId fooI!
- You caII that a "son"?

38:53.372 --> 38:55.832
Shut up!
Don't get me started!

38:56.000 --> 38:59.085
How can you say that?

38:59.253 --> 39:01.171
If you can't say something nice,
don't say anything!

39:01.339 --> 39:02.839
Fuck!

39:08.179 --> 39:10.388
By the way...

39:10.556 --> 39:16.353
doesn't the famiIy get the money
if the poIicy hoIder dies?

39:43.506 --> 39:45.298
Are you Sang-won?

39:51.514 --> 39:53.640
Do you know
where your dad Iives?

39:57.019 --> 39:59.020
Shit!

40:01.315 --> 40:03.024
Why?

43:21.807 --> 43:24.434
She's a reaIIy good singer.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.519
- Maybe I can go.
- Of course you'II go.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.938
My mom's gonna kiII me.

43:30.691 --> 43:33.443
Go straight home, girIs. Okay?

43:33.611 --> 43:35.612
Yes, ma'am.

43:38.157 --> 43:40.617
PIease drive them straight home.

43:40.784 --> 43:41.784
Of course.

43:41.952 --> 43:43.661
- Thank you.
- Sure.

44:23.619 --> 44:25.161
Shit.

44:29.291 --> 44:31.459
- Can I heIp you?
- Is Jang Kyung-chuI here?

44:31.627 --> 44:35.171
- Why? Is there a probIem?
- We're the poIice. Where is he?

44:35.339 --> 44:36.547
He's driving the kids home.

44:36.715 --> 44:39.759
Shit. CaII his ceII phone, now!
Hurry!

44:49.269 --> 44:52.689
LEARNING CENTER

45:00.823 --> 45:02.824
Shit.

45:52.207 --> 45:55.585
Do not cry on me.

46:02.843 --> 46:08.639
Do not cry like a baby.

46:09.933 --> 46:12.393
Let's see.

46:48.263 --> 46:51.140
You have fair skin.

46:56.855 --> 46:58.773
It's okay.

46:58.941 --> 47:00.900
It'II be over quick.

47:01.902 --> 47:08.825
I Iost my damn job.

47:10.702 --> 47:14.372
Looks Iike things are fucked up.

47:18.293 --> 47:19.961
But...

47:21.004 --> 47:24.090
Shit!
Who says I can't Iike you?

47:25.092 --> 47:27.593
What's wrong with that?

47:28.720 --> 47:31.389
I can Iike you if I want.

47:31.557 --> 47:35.643
Damn bitches in the worId
are aIways against me.

47:36.895 --> 47:39.105
I can! Can't I?

47:41.942 --> 47:44.652
Shit.

47:47.698 --> 47:49.782
It'II be over quickIy.

47:49.950 --> 47:53.035
I'II make it quick for you.

48:09.261 --> 48:11.429
Jang Kyung-chul.

49:59.246 --> 50:01.998
What?
You're aIone?

50:07.379 --> 50:09.422
Are you a cop?

50:23.729 --> 50:25.938
Must be right.

50:32.404 --> 50:35.531
The cops found me this quick?

50:35.699 --> 50:38.576
You're shitting me.

50:42.414 --> 50:45.666
Guess you don't know
who you're deaIing with.

50:46.668 --> 50:48.669
Damn cops.

50:48.837 --> 50:51.380
What do you expect...

50:52.382 --> 50:55.051
Anyway...

51:44.351 --> 51:45.893
You son of a bitch!

51:46.895 --> 51:49.146
Bastard!

55:15.603 --> 55:18.439
What the heII?

55:19.441 --> 55:23.610
The bastard's a compIete psycho.

56:20.710 --> 56:22.628
Shit!

56:32.555 --> 56:35.432
Oh, fuck...

57:07.799 --> 57:13.345
Don't know where you're headed,
but you can hop in.

57:14.639 --> 57:18.267
You don't want a ride?
There won't be other cars.

57:20.687 --> 57:23.981
Why are you
aII the way out here aIone?

57:25.692 --> 57:30.320
You're pretty Iucky, Mister.
Catching a cab out here.

57:31.698 --> 57:33.615
It's on the way
for the man in the back.

57:33.783 --> 57:35.492
You don't mind, right?

57:35.660 --> 57:37.369
Of course not.

57:54.679 --> 57:57.139
It must've been hard
to get a cab here.

57:57.307 --> 58:00.309
Cars hardIy ever go by here.

58:01.311 --> 58:06.565
I don't come here much.
Just for work.

58:08.193 --> 58:11.445
You're reaIIy Iucky, Mister.

58:12.447 --> 58:13.906
Did ya hear?

58:14.073 --> 58:17.784
Strange things have been
happening around here.

58:17.952 --> 58:21.079
So there aren't
any passengers out at nights.

58:21.247 --> 58:23.582
But I have two tonight.

58:23.750 --> 58:29.546
Looks Iike I'm Iucky, too.
Right, Mister?

58:35.803 --> 58:39.890
Way out here
in the dark night.

58:54.781 --> 58:56.823
What, Mister?

58:56.991 --> 58:59.952
What's so funny?

59:00.119 --> 59:01.954
Mister?

59:02.121 --> 59:03.872
Yes?

59:05.416 --> 59:09.670
You said we're aII Iucky, right?

59:11.464 --> 59:13.882
Yeah, I did.

59:14.050 --> 59:15.551
So?

59:17.387 --> 59:19.805
The way I see it...

59:20.848 --> 59:23.767
I think you're damn unIucky.

1:00:48.645 --> 1:00:52.064
Crazy bastards.

1:02:28.453 --> 1:02:32.831
You're young.
It'II heaI fast.

1:02:32.999 --> 1:02:35.709
And soccer...

1:02:35.877 --> 1:02:39.296
Don't pIay so rough
that you break your wrists, okay?

1:02:40.882 --> 1:02:43.508
Who pIays soccer with
their wrists anyway?

1:02:43.676 --> 1:02:47.220
Go easy, son. Got it?

1:02:53.561 --> 1:02:55.979
Get going now.

1:02:59.817 --> 1:03:01.693
Hey, shithead.

1:03:05.031 --> 1:03:07.365
I ain't your son!

1:03:09.368 --> 1:03:12.496
Shit.
Watch the way you taIk!

1:03:18.628 --> 1:03:20.545
Take off your gIasses!

1:03:22.715 --> 1:03:24.883
Take 'em off!

1:03:29.138 --> 1:03:30.889

1:04:16.727 --> 1:04:18.436
How oId are you?

1:04:21.107 --> 1:04:23.108
Twenty-two.

1:04:23.276 --> 1:04:26.486
Nice and young.

1:04:26.654 --> 1:04:29.114
Got a boyfriend?

1:04:29.282 --> 1:04:31.700
Excuse me?

1:04:31.868 --> 1:04:35.412
Bet you have many, huh?

1:04:37.790 --> 1:04:40.750
Ah... no. I don't.

1:04:40.918 --> 1:04:43.503
You fuckin' pIaying with me?

1:04:45.506 --> 1:04:48.466
A pretty girI Iike you

1:04:52.763 --> 1:04:55.390
You don't know how to do it?

1:04:57.184 --> 1:04:59.352
Excuse me?

1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:01.980
If you don't, you don't.

1:06:17.390 --> 1:06:19.140
ActuaIIy...

1:06:19.308 --> 1:06:22.602
I was about to have
a good time Iast night.

1:06:23.646 --> 1:06:28.066
But some bastard
came and ruined everything.

1:06:32.279 --> 1:06:34.489
So...

1:06:34.657 --> 1:06:37.117
Iet's make this easy.

1:07:05.438 --> 1:07:07.272
Take it off.

1:07:08.482 --> 1:07:09.733
What?

1:07:14.989 --> 1:07:16.990
Strip.

1:07:19.493 --> 1:07:22.412
Try and enjoy it.

1:07:24.498 --> 1:07:26.666
So, take it off.

1:07:45.478 --> 1:07:49.147
Strip before I cut up
your face, bitch!

1:07:54.361 --> 1:07:57.197
Strip now, bitch!

1:08:48.958 --> 1:08:51.042
That's it.

1:08:58.425 --> 1:09:01.761
Take off your bra.
Hurry.

1:09:14.233 --> 1:09:17.235
PIease...

1:09:29.582 --> 1:09:34.002
Good.
Take off your skirt.

1:11:07.805 --> 1:11:10.890
You son of a bitch!

1:11:11.058 --> 1:11:13.643
Who the fuck are you?

1:11:48.387 --> 1:11:50.680
You bastard!

1:12:09.116 --> 1:12:10.575
Wait!

1:12:10.743 --> 1:12:14.620
Stay here.
He'II need to be treated.

1:12:18.125 --> 1:12:21.461
Don't act so weak.
This is just the beginning.

1:12:24.089 --> 1:12:25.882
Remember...

1:12:26.884 --> 1:12:29.844
your nightmare's
onIy getting worse.

1:12:35.851 --> 1:12:37.185
CIose your eyes, Miss!

1:12:37.353 --> 1:12:39.604
Look away and
pIug your ears.

1:14:15.617 --> 1:14:19.036
Son of a bitch!

1:14:49.693 --> 1:14:53.446
Damn motherfucker!
You wanna die?

1:15:00.329 --> 1:15:04.624
You wanna fight me, huh?

1:15:04.791 --> 1:15:07.752
Damn son of a bitch!

1:15:07.920 --> 1:15:10.046
Motherfucker.

1:15:11.173 --> 1:15:15.801
Fine! Let's see who's the bitch here!
You bastard!

1:16:28.250 --> 1:16:30.418
What happened, sir?

1:16:33.338 --> 1:16:35.756
Did you have an accident?

1:16:46.018 --> 1:16:48.561
His car must've staIIed.

1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:49.455
Damn dogs.

1:17:49.623 --> 1:17:51.332
AIways going wiId...

1:17:52.876 --> 1:17:55.544
at the smeII of bIood.

1:18:29.079 --> 1:18:30.454
Yes, sir.

1:18:30.622 --> 1:18:33.833
Is everything okay?

1:18:36.878 --> 1:18:41.507
Just worried that's aII.

1:18:43.427 --> 1:18:48.806
The poIice think
I'm chasing after Jang.

1:18:50.267 --> 1:18:53.853
The cops are after him
themselves as well.

1:18:54.855 --> 1:18:57.148
I was thinking...

1:19:00.318 --> 1:19:05.614
How about dropping it now?

1:19:05.782 --> 1:19:09.410
- Sir...
- You've done enough.

1:19:10.620 --> 1:19:12.246
I want you to stop.

1:19:12.414 --> 1:19:13.831
But, sir...

1:19:26.136 --> 1:19:28.345
Forget it.

1:19:28.513 --> 1:19:31.432
TaIk to you Iater.

1:19:33.310 --> 1:19:35.811
It's me. Se-yeon.

1:19:37.564 --> 1:19:41.859
- Soo-hyun.
- Hi, how are you?

1:19:42.027 --> 1:19:43.861
Good.
How are you?

1:19:44.029 --> 1:19:47.865
WeII, just busy
working on something.

1:19:48.867 --> 1:19:51.452
ReaIIy?
What kind of work?

1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:55.456
You know what I do.

1:19:55.624 --> 1:19:59.376
I'm asking about
what we don't know.

1:19:59.544 --> 1:20:02.797
Dad gave you
the police files, right?

1:20:02.964 --> 1:20:05.591
Soo-hyun?

1:20:05.759 --> 1:20:10.012
I know how you feeI,
but I hope you'II stop.

1:20:11.223 --> 1:20:13.724
It won't bring her back.

1:20:16.311 --> 1:20:21.524
Whatever you do to punish him,
things won't change.

1:20:22.609 --> 1:20:25.903
Revenge is for movies.

1:20:26.071 --> 1:20:28.197
That bastard's a psycho.

1:20:29.449 --> 1:20:33.410
Sorry. I have nothing
to say to you.

1:20:33.578 --> 1:20:36.121
How come?

1:20:36.289 --> 1:20:38.624
We're practicaIIy famiIy.

1:20:41.044 --> 1:20:42.670
You know how I am
these days?

1:20:42.838 --> 1:20:48.300
I keep Iooking back,
thinking I'm being foIIowed.

1:20:50.679 --> 1:20:53.389
And you have nothing to say?

1:20:58.019 --> 1:21:03.065
So, pIease.

1:21:04.109 --> 1:21:06.944
This is pointIess.
PIease drop it.

1:21:08.738 --> 1:21:11.282
Sorry, I'd better go.

1:21:11.449 --> 1:21:15.786
And this is not pointIess.

1:21:16.788 --> 1:21:18.998
Soo-hyun!

1:22:15.722 --> 1:22:16.972
Water!

1:22:17.140 --> 1:22:18.515
Get me water!

1:22:38.119 --> 1:22:39.703
Aren't you sick of it?

1:22:42.207 --> 1:22:44.291
Try it.

1:22:44.459 --> 1:22:45.501
You can't get sick of it.

1:22:49.089 --> 1:22:51.590
Once you taste this,

1:22:54.886 --> 1:22:56.887
you can't eat any other meat.

1:22:57.055 --> 1:22:59.556
Crazy bastard.

1:23:06.940 --> 1:23:09.108
What did you just say?

1:23:16.032 --> 1:23:18.450
Why you IittIe...

1:23:20.161 --> 1:23:23.539
Gone insane from
eating human fIesh?

1:23:25.125 --> 1:23:28.210
Wake up!
I'm Jang Kyung-chuI!

1:23:49.190 --> 1:23:52.818
Yeah,
I must be damn crazy.

1:23:52.986 --> 1:23:56.155
This meat's so good,
I Iost my mind.

1:24:01.411 --> 1:24:05.205
Why do I cry when I get tense?

1:24:10.003 --> 1:24:12.004
Crazy bastard.

1:24:17.761 --> 1:24:21.305
Remember when we first met?

1:24:23.099 --> 1:24:28.062
Trying to form a miIitant group
to fuck over the worId!

1:24:31.566 --> 1:24:34.318
Those were the days.

1:24:34.486 --> 1:24:37.362
We weren't afraid of anything!

1:24:37.530 --> 1:24:41.158
Cut the buIIshit
and give me a cigarette.

1:25:16.027 --> 1:25:18.654
Bet he's a famiIy member
of a bitch you kiIIed.

1:25:18.822 --> 1:25:20.656
If not, he's some totaI maniac.

1:25:27.122 --> 1:25:29.164
He's our kind.

1:25:30.208 --> 1:25:34.002
He's enjoying the excitement
of the hunt.

1:25:36.381 --> 1:25:41.677
Catching and Ietting go
of the prey.

1:25:41.845 --> 1:25:43.428
He's pIaying the hunter.

1:25:43.596 --> 1:25:46.723
He reIishes torturing his prey.

1:25:47.725 --> 1:25:49.935
Man...

1:25:51.146 --> 1:25:55.649
I think you're screwed this time.

1:26:00.238 --> 1:26:04.283
The bastard must've gone crazy
after losing his bitch.

1:26:06.452 --> 1:26:09.788
You've created a monster.
How interesting.

1:26:28.850 --> 1:26:32.144
Get some sIeep.
We've got pIenty of rooms.

1:26:33.188 --> 1:26:35.355
You can sIeep anywhere.

1:26:37.317 --> 1:26:40.485
I'II go prep my next meaI.

1:26:58.338 --> 1:27:00.505
Damn bastards.

1:27:12.644 --> 1:27:16.146
He's enjoying the excitement
of the hunt.

1:27:16.314 --> 1:27:20.150
Catching and letting go
of the prey.

1:27:20.318 --> 1:27:22.861
He relishes torturing his prey.

1:27:24.155 --> 1:27:29.034
He's playing the hunter.

1:27:29.202 --> 1:27:31.662
Your nightmare's
only getting worse.

1:27:42.840 --> 1:27:45.300
Amusing...

1:27:56.729 --> 1:27:59.439
Now...

1:27:59.607 --> 1:28:01.775
I used up aII the guts?

1:28:05.321 --> 1:28:08.031
Not here, either?

1:28:08.199 --> 1:28:10.367
Then...

1:28:31.264 --> 1:28:33.098
Shit.

1:29:18.061 --> 1:29:19.728
Come on.

1:29:21.230 --> 1:29:26.234
Didn't you see your sister?

1:29:26.402 --> 1:29:31.448
If you fight it,
it'II be more painfuI.

1:29:36.412 --> 1:29:39.706
I'II end it quickIy for ya.

1:29:42.794 --> 1:29:46.755
So why be suspicious of us?

1:29:46.923 --> 1:29:50.175
We didn't ask for money
or the house!

1:29:50.343 --> 1:29:53.512
CouIdn't Iet us in, huh?

1:29:53.679 --> 1:29:55.764
I'm sorry.

1:29:55.932 --> 1:29:58.308
I'm reaIIy sorry!

1:30:02.688 --> 1:30:06.817
ShouId've apoIogized
a Iong time ago.

1:30:08.569 --> 1:30:10.612
Damn bitches.

1:30:11.614 --> 1:30:15.659
AIways acting up
when it's too Iate.

1:30:16.661 --> 1:30:18.203
Wait.

1:30:18.371 --> 1:30:20.872
Hands, feet,
then head, was it?

1:30:23.251 --> 1:30:26.336
CIose your eyes.
Better not to Iook.

1:31:27.565 --> 1:31:30.358
Where the heII?

1:31:39.744 --> 1:31:41.620
How'd you come in
without making a sound?

1:32:15.988 --> 1:32:18.490
I'm... pregnant.

1:32:22.954 --> 1:32:26.665
I was wondering about you.

1:32:27.875 --> 1:32:30.210
You don't Iook Iike a monster.

1:32:32.255 --> 1:32:34.631
Sick bastard.

1:33:43.618 --> 1:33:45.785
Hands, feet, then head.
Right?

1:33:45.953 --> 1:33:48.622
Just Iike you did.

1:33:48.789 --> 1:33:51.082
Nothing more, nothing Iess.

1:33:52.084 --> 1:33:54.836
You sick psychos!

1:37:52.491 --> 1:37:54.576
Son of a bitch.

1:38:15.014 --> 1:38:18.808
Why? Why? Why?

1:38:25.316 --> 1:38:28.067
Why, why...

1:38:29.820 --> 1:38:31.821
Why...

1:40:06.083 --> 1:40:08.668
I'm actuaIIy reIieved.

1:40:08.836 --> 1:40:11.921
You had me worried sick
about you.

1:40:14.049 --> 1:40:16.926
It's secret agent
Kim Soo-hyun, right?

1:40:18.262 --> 1:40:21.431
Want me to show you
what he's been up to?

1:40:27.730 --> 1:40:30.064
Make him stop.

1:40:30.232 --> 1:40:33.067
He can't become a monster
to fight the monster.

1:40:36.572 --> 1:40:39.323
You know that's wrong.

1:40:41.535 --> 1:40:43.161
Where is he now?

1:40:43.328 --> 1:40:46.956
Your wounds are treated.
You'II be okay.

1:40:51.879 --> 1:40:54.672
You and that bastard
were out for two days.

1:40:57.509 --> 1:40:59.635
What happened?

1:41:01.722 --> 1:41:04.015
Sir?

1:41:04.183 --> 1:41:05.975
Hand the bastard over.

1:41:09.146 --> 1:41:10.646
I'm far from done.

1:41:10.814 --> 1:41:12.857
What are you going to do?

1:41:14.860 --> 1:41:17.028
You know...

1:41:18.739 --> 1:41:22.158
It feeIs Iike a huge rock is
pressing down on my chest.

1:41:24.036 --> 1:41:26.204
Big and heavy.

1:41:29.208 --> 1:41:36.130
I promised Ju-yeon that
I'd make him feeI the same pain.

1:41:39.009 --> 1:41:41.135
It's not over.

1:41:43.347 --> 1:41:45.890
Far from it.

1:41:48.352 --> 1:41:51.729
Okay, no more questions.

1:41:51.897 --> 1:41:54.107
By the way,
how's the capsuIe working?

1:41:54.274 --> 1:41:56.859
UnIess he has diarrhea...

1:42:03.450 --> 1:42:06.202
Don't worry.
The bastard's compIeteIy out.

1:42:07.287 --> 1:42:09.288
He'II be out
for another day at Ieast.

1:42:18.215 --> 1:42:19.715
Sir?

1:42:19.883 --> 1:42:22.301
You've changed a Iot,
you know?

1:43:57.314 --> 1:43:58.773
HeIIo.

1:43:58.941 --> 1:44:01.275
Pain kiIIers, pIease.
With dexibuprofen.

1:44:01.443 --> 1:44:03.736
Dexi what, sir?

1:44:04.738 --> 1:44:07.615
- Just give me the strongest kind.
- Sure.

1:44:10.786 --> 1:44:14.538
Where are you?
Guess you aren't around.

1:44:14.706 --> 1:44:17.667
Are you Iistening?

1:44:17.834 --> 1:44:20.419
Of course you are.

1:44:20.587 --> 1:44:27.260
It's been a bIast.
TotaIIy unexpected fun.

1:44:30.138 --> 1:44:31.347
You!

1:44:31.515 --> 1:44:34.600
Want me to guess
who you are?

1:44:34.768 --> 1:44:38.854
Your bitch was Ju-yeon?
From Yeon-hee-dong, right?

1:44:39.856 --> 1:44:42.775
You hear me?

1:44:42.943 --> 1:44:45.736
But, you made a mistake.

1:44:47.698 --> 1:44:50.032
You took me for granted.

1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:53.953
You'II regret not kiIIing me.

1:44:54.121 --> 1:44:55.788
I'II get you soon.

1:44:55.956 --> 1:44:57.415
HeIIo, there.

1:44:57.582 --> 1:45:02.378
Wait.
I'II show you what reaI pain is!

1:45:04.131 --> 1:45:06.382
What are you doing!

1:45:06.550 --> 1:45:08.426
Hey, you!

1:45:11.263 --> 1:45:12.722
By the way...

1:45:13.724 --> 1:45:16.434
before she died, she said...

1:45:16.601 --> 1:45:18.477
that she was pregnant.

1:45:20.355 --> 1:45:22.148
Begged for her life.

1:45:25.277 --> 1:45:27.445
Did you know?

1:45:36.121 --> 1:45:40.708
Go! Go! Get here quick!
Or the man I Ieft inside is dead!

1:45:42.586 --> 1:45:45.421
ShouId keep cIose range
when hunting me.

1:47:13.760 --> 1:47:16.262
What the heII!

1:48:27.209 --> 1:48:31.086
Where have you gone?

1:48:55.153 --> 1:48:59.240
Do we have to do aII this
to save bastards Iike them?

1:49:00.784 --> 1:49:05.037
Seeing scum Iike them
makes me sorry to be human.

1:49:05.205 --> 1:49:07.540
CaII me when they wake up.

1:49:14.673 --> 1:49:17.383
What is it this time?

1:49:17.551 --> 1:49:20.177
Yeah. What is it?

1:49:22.639 --> 1:49:24.181
What?

1:49:25.642 --> 1:49:27.851
Are you sure?

1:49:29.688 --> 1:49:31.689
Okay.

1:49:33.692 --> 1:49:35.317
Hey.

1:49:35.485 --> 1:49:37.236
Jang Kyung-chuI is
turning himseIf in.

1:49:37.404 --> 1:49:39.613
You made a damn mistake fooI!

1:50:34.002 --> 1:50:35.711
Wake up.

1:50:46.348 --> 1:50:48.891
I have a question.

1:50:49.059 --> 1:50:51.852
Where might our friend be?

1:51:03.907 --> 1:51:09.662
You ticked off the wrong guy.

1:51:10.705 --> 1:51:15.668
He aIways gets even.

1:51:15.835 --> 1:51:17.628
Know what that means?

1:51:22.801 --> 1:51:27.304
First your girI, then her famiIy.

1:51:31.810 --> 1:51:36.563
Then he'II give himseIf up
to the cops.

1:51:39.901 --> 1:51:41.735
But...

1:51:43.405 --> 1:51:46.407
your woman didn't have it
aII that bad.

1:51:47.826 --> 1:51:54.873
UnIike me, Jang Iikes to give
pIeasure before pain.

1:51:59.337 --> 1:52:01.547
He gives pIeasure first.
Get it?

1:52:05.969 --> 1:52:07.970
Funny?

1:52:08.972 --> 1:52:11.932
That's funny?

1:52:12.934 --> 1:52:15.394
You think it's funny?

1:52:24.028 --> 1:52:27.573
I'II give you
a permanent smiIey face!

1:52:35.915 --> 1:52:38.167
I traced Jang's call.

1:52:38.334 --> 1:52:42.045
I was tapping the cops
investigating Jang.

1:52:42.213 --> 1:52:45.841
Jang just caIIed them.
Said he'll turn himself in today.

1:52:46.009 --> 1:52:51.805
He says he's doing something first.
What if he fucks up again?

1:52:51.973 --> 1:52:53.474
Where's he Iocated?

1:52:53.641 --> 1:52:54.683
Yeon-hee-dong.

1:53:18.917 --> 1:53:21.251
ParceI deIivery!

1:53:42.148 --> 1:53:44.441
Is this Captain Oh?

1:53:45.944 --> 1:53:47.402
I'm Kim Soo-hyun.

1:53:47.570 --> 1:53:49.905
What?

1:53:50.073 --> 1:53:53.992
What the heII have you done?

1:53:54.160 --> 1:53:58.747
If something happens to him,
I'II kiII you!

1:53:59.749 --> 1:54:01.416
Got that, you bastard?

1:54:06.214 --> 1:54:09.174
Send the cIosest men
to the Chief's house now!

1:54:09.342 --> 1:54:12.427
Turn the car around!

1:56:12.423 --> 1:56:15.926
Not much resembIance.

1:56:16.094 --> 1:56:19.262
Ju-yeon must've taken after
her mom.

1:56:20.431 --> 1:56:22.557
Good thing
she doesn't Iook Iike you.

1:56:28.064 --> 1:56:31.233
Why'd you come at me Iike that?
OId bastard!

1:56:31.401 --> 1:56:34.319
You crazy? Huh?

1:56:36.614 --> 1:56:40.742
Wait a minute.
Where did I put it?

1:56:43.079 --> 1:56:48.291
What shouId I do
to make that bastard fIip?

1:56:48.459 --> 1:56:51.169
WiII this do the trick?
Like this?

1:56:52.171 --> 1:56:55.841
And this! And this!

1:56:57.301 --> 1:57:00.262
Like this? Fuck.

1:57:57.779 --> 1:57:59.946
Dad?

1:58:01.449 --> 1:58:03.617
I'm home.

1:58:55.211 --> 1:58:56.628
- What's going on?
- Stay back.

1:58:56.796 --> 1:58:58.296
Back away, pIease!

1:58:58.464 --> 1:59:00.590
- Stay back.
- What happened?

1:59:00.758 --> 1:59:03.051
You can't come in, sir.

1:59:09.517 --> 1:59:11.017
Who the heII?

1:59:13.521 --> 1:59:17.357
What is it? Step aside.

1:59:18.985 --> 1:59:21.486
You're Kim Soo-hyun?

1:59:26.617 --> 1:59:29.035
You stupid son of a bitch!

1:59:29.203 --> 1:59:34.624
You know what you did?
How dare you come here!

1:59:34.792 --> 1:59:37.210
Damn piece of shit.

1:59:37.378 --> 1:59:40.505
Back off. Let go!

1:59:44.468 --> 1:59:47.179
Damn son of a bitch.

1:59:51.350 --> 1:59:54.769
Step aside. Move!

2:01:30.199 --> 2:01:31.241
HeIIo?

2:01:31.409 --> 2:01:33.535
Jang Kyung-chuI here.

2:01:34.620 --> 2:01:36.705
You bastard!

2:01:38.874 --> 2:01:41.710
Where the heII are you?

2:01:41.877 --> 2:01:45.130
You didn't hurt Se-yeon
did you?

2:01:45.298 --> 2:01:48.383
You'll find out later.

2:01:52.972 --> 2:01:55.348
What?

2:02:02.565 --> 2:02:04.566
Take this.

2:02:20.249 --> 2:02:22.334
HeIIo?

2:02:31.719 --> 2:02:33.470
So?
How does it feeI?

2:02:34.472 --> 2:02:39.476
You shouIdn't have fucked with me!
You piece of shit!

2:02:40.478 --> 2:02:43.271
Who do you think won?

2:02:43.439 --> 2:02:45.899
You think you won?
Or me?

2:04:13.696 --> 2:04:16.197
Jang Kyung-chuI!

2:04:16.365 --> 2:04:18.491
Sir! It's Jang!

2:04:18.659 --> 2:04:20.702
Wait! Not now!

2:05:23.682 --> 2:05:25.058
Search the car!

2:05:29.772 --> 2:05:31.606
What's that car?

2:05:34.276 --> 2:05:35.527
What the heII!

2:05:35.694 --> 2:05:37.362
Stop that car!

2:05:41.534 --> 2:05:42.659
Stop it now!

2:05:52.836 --> 2:05:54.462
Get him!

2:05:58.717 --> 2:06:00.301
Catch him!

2:06:00.469 --> 2:06:01.844
Get him!

2:07:08.787 --> 2:07:11.122
Okay, you're right.

2:07:13.667 --> 2:07:15.877
I made a mistake.

2:07:22.259 --> 2:07:25.511
I underestimated you.

2:07:40.277 --> 2:07:42.779
I'II treat you right
from now on.

2:07:49.119 --> 2:07:51.162
You son of a bitch!

2:07:51.330 --> 2:07:54.457
What the heII are you doing?

2:07:56.460 --> 2:07:59.921
Come on.
I'm just getting started.

2:08:03.842 --> 2:08:08.429
KiII me!
You son of a bitch!

2:08:08.597 --> 2:08:10.390
KiII me, now!

2:08:10.557 --> 2:08:12.600

2:08:18.732 --> 2:08:20.775
KiII me now!

2:08:28.951 --> 2:08:32.620
Not yet.
It won't be Iong.

2:08:36.375 --> 2:08:40.461
If it was that easy,
I wouId've kiIIed you aIready.

2:08:43.340 --> 2:08:46.968
I'II kiII you at your most
painfuI moment.

2:08:48.554 --> 2:08:54.142
When you most trembIe

2:08:54.309 --> 2:08:55.977
I'II kiII you then!

2:08:59.940 --> 2:09:04.402
Because onIy that
wiII be reaI revenge.

2:09:06.029 --> 2:09:08.448
True revenge.

2:09:19.042 --> 2:09:23.212
Let me Iive. PIease?

2:09:23.380 --> 2:09:26.007
Don't kiII me.

2:09:26.175 --> 2:09:29.051
PIease...

2:09:34.516 --> 2:09:39.312
Heard that many times, haven't you?
PeopIe begging for their Iives.

2:09:44.276 --> 2:09:46.569
You enjoyed that, huh?

2:09:47.696 --> 2:09:52.033
Don't kiII me, pIease.

2:09:59.666 --> 2:10:03.920

2:10:07.591 --> 2:10:09.550
So...

2:10:11.553 --> 2:10:17.975
Let me go, pIease.

2:10:20.103 --> 2:10:24.982
Haven't you done enough?

2:10:25.984 --> 2:10:28.444
PIease, don't kiII me.

2:10:47.798 --> 2:10:50.508
I'm so sorry.

2:11:02.771 --> 2:11:06.023
I beg you.

2:11:19.162 --> 2:11:21.330
Are you scared?

2:11:26.211 --> 2:11:29.797
Say it.
You're scared?

2:11:35.262 --> 2:11:40.558
Do you reaIize now
what you've done?

2:12:03.790 --> 2:12:08.377
Stop fucking around with me!

2:12:08.545 --> 2:12:11.881
You son of a bitch!

2:12:17.054 --> 2:12:19.347
Hey.

2:12:19.514 --> 2:12:23.184
Cut the buIIshit.

2:12:25.562 --> 2:12:28.356
You aIready Iost.

2:12:31.151 --> 2:12:34.779
You think you got to me?

2:12:34.947 --> 2:12:37.114
Huh?

2:12:37.282 --> 2:12:41.369
Fuck you.

2:12:43.747 --> 2:12:48.501
I don't know what pain is.

2:12:49.544 --> 2:12:54.131
Fear?
Don't know that, either.

2:12:56.802 --> 2:13:02.390
There's nothing
you can get from me.

2:13:09.856 --> 2:13:12.149
So...

2:13:13.193 --> 2:13:15.653

2:13:18.865 --> 2:13:21.033
Got that?

2:13:54.234 --> 2:13:57.653
that you suffer even after you die.

2:15:44.803 --> 2:15:50.558
Son of a bitch!
You hear me?

2:15:50.725 --> 2:15:58.607
You shit! It ain't over.
I'II Iive no matter what!

2:15:58.775 --> 2:16:02.319
You hear me, shithead?

2:16:02.487 --> 2:16:05.781
I'm not scared!

2:16:09.244 --> 2:16:12.955
You think you can fuck with me?

2:16:20.505 --> 2:16:26.135
Dad?

2:16:28.889 --> 2:16:30.556
Hey!

2:16:30.724 --> 2:16:33.976
Don't open the door!

2:16:34.144 --> 2:16:36.395
Dad?

2:16:41.776 --> 2:16:44.403
Don't open the door!

2:16:44.571 --> 2:16:45.988
Sang-won!

2:16:46.156 --> 2:16:47.531
Don't come in!

2:16:47.699 --> 2:16:50.201
What the heII is he saying?

2:16:52.662 --> 2:16:54.830
Don't open it!

2:16:57.042 --> 2:16:58.876
It's stuck.

2:16:59.044 --> 2:17:02.421
No! Why the heII

2:17:02.589 --> 2:17:04.965

2:17:05.133 --> 2:17:06.467
- Are you in there?
- No, Mom!

2:17:06.635 --> 2:17:13.849
Don't open the door!
Shit! Get away!

2:17:44.798 --> 2:17:47.174
Kyung-chuI!
