They're lost in here, too.

13:15.417 --> 13:18.125
Look, it's gonna be dark soon.
We should stick together.

13:22.375 --> 13:25.125
I understand.
You don't know me from Adam.

13:25.208 --> 13:26.042
Uh...

13:26.125 --> 13:29.250
Ross Humbolt's the name.
Real estate's the game. [chuckles]

13:29.333 --> 13:31.500
Poughkeepsie, wife's Natalie, boy's Tobin.

13:32.083 --> 13:33.708
[Cal] Becky, what's happening?

13:36.792 --> 13:38.042
I'm all right, Cal.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.042
You can find my brother?

13:41.125 --> 13:42.750
Your brother, I'll try, yeah.

13:42.833 --> 13:46.083
Not like walking a straight line, though.
Nothing is around here.

13:46.833 --> 13:48.125
Just follow me, but stay close.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.958
Whatever you do,
don't lose sight of me, okay?

13:51.417 --> 13:52.250
Okay.

13:52.917 --> 13:54.792
Hang tight, Cal. We're coming for ya.

14:13.708 --> 14:15.000
[Cal] Becky!

14:17.042 --> 14:18.500
[wearily] Becky!

14:20.958 --> 14:22.250
Becky!

14:28.667 --> 14:30.208
[sobbing]

14:31.500 --> 14:32.833
[grunts]

14:38.917 --> 14:40.417
[sobbing]

14:40.500 --> 14:42.208
I'm never gonna find her.

14:43.667 --> 14:45.250
-[Tobin] You can find things.
-[gasps]

14:46.375 --> 14:48.083
But it's easier once they're dead.

14:53.250 --> 14:54.167
Tobin?

14:54.792 --> 14:57.042
The field doesn't move dead things around.

15:05.875 --> 15:06.750
Tobin...

15:09.583 --> 15:11.167
did you lure us in here?

15:13.250 --> 15:14.250
You can tell me.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.333
Okay?

15:17.125 --> 15:18.125
I won't be mad.

15:21.583 --> 15:22.417
No.

15:23.542 --> 15:24.917
We heard someone yelling.

15:25.417 --> 15:26.292
A man.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.042
He was calling for help.

15:30.417 --> 15:31.625
That's how we got in.

15:32.708 --> 15:34.000
That's how it works.

15:34.667 --> 15:36.583
How long have you been in here?

15:36.667 --> 15:37.750
I'm not sure.

15:40.500 --> 15:41.375
Becky...

15:43.542 --> 15:44.583
your sister...

15:47.833 --> 15:49.333
she's gonna die soon.

16:01.792 --> 16:03.625
How do you know she's my sister?

16:03.958 --> 16:04.833
The rock.

16:05.542 --> 16:07.708
The rock teaches you
to hear the tall grass.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.792
The tall grass knows everything.

16:13.167 --> 16:14.000
Then...

16:14.750 --> 16:16.208
you must know where she is.

16:17.417 --> 16:18.250
Yeah?

16:19.583 --> 16:21.000
I can find out for you.

16:22.917 --> 16:23.750
No...

16:24.500 --> 16:25.875
I can do better than that.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.542
I can show you.

16:29.833 --> 16:30.917
Do you wanna see her?

16:31.750 --> 16:32.750
Do you wanna check on her?

16:32.833 --> 16:34.708
Come on, follow me.

16:35.667 --> 16:36.875
[exhales sharply]

16:48.042 --> 16:49.292
[grunts]

16:51.375 --> 16:52.542
How far are you along?

16:53.625 --> 16:54.708
Oh, uh...

16:54.792 --> 16:56.208
-Six months.
-Oh!

16:58.500 --> 17:00.167
I remember when Natalie was pregnant.

17:00.708 --> 17:01.708
[chuckles]

17:02.125 --> 17:03.708
Those were the salad days.

17:03.792 --> 17:04.625
Enjoy it.

17:05.292 --> 17:07.458
Enjoy your baby, because it goes fast.

17:11.458 --> 17:12.292
Oh.

17:12.792 --> 17:14.042
Dad not in the picture?

17:17.208 --> 17:18.292
He wasn't ready for it.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.125
Well, too bad for him.

17:21.375 --> 17:22.292
Hmm.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.292
You know...

17:25.042 --> 17:26.208
family's everything.

17:28.542 --> 17:30.125
If there's one thing I know for certain,

17:30.750 --> 17:31.958
it's that simple truth.

17:33.958 --> 17:35.292
Well, we better get going.

17:36.083 --> 17:37.875
The sooner we get to them, the better.

17:46.625 --> 17:50.167
[Becky breathing heavily]

17:56.250 --> 17:57.125
Ross?

18:02.333 --> 18:03.167
Hello?

18:08.000 --> 18:08.833
Hello?

18:15.792 --> 18:16.625
Cal!

18:18.000 --> 18:19.375
Are you out there?

18:20.417 --> 18:21.250
Cal?

18:22.917 --> 18:23.750
Cal!

18:23.833 --> 18:25.083
[screams]

18:29.250 --> 18:30.167
[Cal] Tobin!

18:31.917 --> 18:33.083
Tobin, you gotta wait!

18:34.625 --> 18:36.000
[groaning]

18:37.250 --> 18:38.792
Hey, Tobin!

18:39.500 --> 18:40.708
Just a little further.

18:40.792 --> 18:42.833
Wait. Tobin, wait. Wait up.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.750
-Tobin.
-Here it is.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.000
[Cal] Wait, please.

18:47.083 --> 18:47.958
Wait for me.

18:51.083 --> 18:52.042
Oh, my God.

19:03.625 --> 19:04.625
[inhales sharply]

19:06.000 --> 19:07.333
Boy, that feels good.

19:08.833 --> 19:10.125
Come on, Cal. Try it.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.583
[panting]

19:51.333 --> 19:52.875
[indistinct whispering]

20:11.708 --> 20:13.792
[Becky screaming]

20:13.875 --> 20:14.708
Becky!

20:14.792 --> 20:16.625
[Becky] Get away from me!

20:16.708 --> 20:18.750
-Get away from me!
<i>-</i>Sorry, Cal.

20:19.333 --> 20:20.333
Too late.

20:20.417 --> 20:23.042
[Becky screams]

20:23.125 --> 20:24.417
Becky!

20:25.000 --> 20:26.167
Wait!

20:26.250 --> 20:27.958
You'll never find her that way.

20:29.167 --> 20:30.417
Becky!

20:32.083 --> 20:33.625
Becky!

20:34.667 --> 20:36.250
Becky!

20:37.958 --> 20:40.000
Becky!

21:27.917 --> 21:29.000
Um...

21:30.500 --> 21:31.958
I'm trying to find these two.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.083
Have you seen them?

21:36.875 --> 21:39.625
[man on radio] <i>...south breezes today,</i>
<i>we've certainly been warming up.</i>

21:39.708 --> 21:41.500
<i>That is about to change</i>

21:41.583 --> 21:43.250
<i>moves in late tonight into the morning.</i>

21:43.333 --> 21:45.333
<i>Ahead of that, clouds increase tonight.</i>

21:45.417 --> 21:47.250
<i>Humidity level creeps up</i>

21:47.333 --> 21:51.000

<i>across especially eastern and southeastern</i>

21:54.875 --> 21:56.083

21:56.167 --> 21:57.792
<i>It's not gonna be cool.</i>

21:57.875 --> 22:00.083
<i>Considering this time of year,</i>

22:00.167 --> 22:02.042

Becky?

Who are you?

Shh.

Do you hear that?

28:20.042 --> 28:21.042
Hear what?

28:21.625 --> 28:24.375
[overlapping laughter
and indistinct whispering]

28:39.500 --> 28:40.667
Everyone else.

28:42.167 --> 28:43.583
If you don't pay attention,

28:44.042 --> 28:45.208
they go away.

28:46.042 --> 28:46.875
Who do?

28:47.583 --> 28:49.375
The people who are stuck in here.

28:49.458 --> 28:52.875
But they're not connected to us,
so... doesn't matter.

28:54.208 --> 28:55.042
We...

28:55.500 --> 28:56.625
are connected?

28:56.708 --> 28:57.625
Sure.

28:57.708 --> 28:58.792
'Cause you know me.

29:00.125 --> 29:01.667
No, I... I don't.

29:02.292 --> 29:03.333
You don't remember?

29:03.417 --> 29:05.917
-Look, kid, we've never met before. I'm--
-Travis.

29:09.542 --> 29:10.500
How do you know my name?

29:10.583 --> 29:12.000
You're looking for Becky.

29:12.458 --> 29:13.417
You...

29:16.375 --> 29:17.500
You know Becky?

29:18.250 --> 29:19.167
Of course.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.792
Wait, how's that even...
Who the hell are you?

29:21.875 --> 29:23.000
Tobin.

29:23.083 --> 29:23.917
Tobin?

29:25.958 --> 29:27.625
You really don't remember?

29:28.875 --> 29:30.417
Look, do you know where she is?

29:33.250 --> 29:34.292
You do, don't you?

29:36.708 --> 29:38.125
Hey, you gotta tell me!

29:38.708 --> 29:39.875
Tell me!

29:39.958 --> 29:40.833
Where is she?

29:41.375 --> 29:42.917
Look at me! Where is she?

29:45.292 --> 29:46.458
I can show you.

29:47.667 --> 29:48.875
-But...
-But what?

29:49.583 --> 29:51.583
-Are you sure you wanna see her?
-Of course! Just...

29:54.583 --> 29:55.417
Please.

29:56.125 --> 29:57.000
Tobin.

29:57.417 --> 29:58.292
All right.

29:59.333 --> 30:01.708
But you gotta stay close.

30:03.292 --> 30:05.000
[panting]

30:30.000 --> 30:30.833
There.

30:33.417 --> 30:34.250
Becky?

30:46.875 --> 30:47.792
Becky.

30:48.583 --> 30:49.417
Oh, Becky.

30:50.042 --> 30:51.958
[Tobin]
The field doesn't move dead things.

whose car it is...

[Freddy barking]

33:14.125 --> 33:15.292
Tobin, is that you?

33:16.125 --> 33:17.792
-Tobin, it's Travis.
-[Freddy whimpers]

33:18.875 --> 33:21.417
What, you... you don't remember me now?

33:21.917 --> 33:24.000
Over there, Mommy. Do you hear him?

33:24.917 --> 33:26.917
What? Where, honey?

33:27.000 --> 33:28.083
In the grass.

33:28.917 --> 33:30.125
He knows my name.

33:31.208 --> 33:32.417
-Are you sure?
-[Travis] Tobin?

33:32.500 --> 33:33.625
[barks]

33:33.708 --> 33:35.833
-It's okay, Freddy. Stay.
-[Travis] Help me!

33:35.917 --> 33:38.333
-Get out! Get somebody.
-We'll close when I get back next week.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.417
Okay?

33:40.250 --> 33:41.875
-[Freddy barking]
-What?

33:41.958 --> 33:44.042
-No. No, no, no. I'm telling you.
-[Tobin] Freddy!

33:44.125 --> 33:45.125
Don't back out of escrow.

33:45.208 --> 33:46.750
-You're not overpaying.
-Tobin! Damn it!

33:47.500 --> 33:49.375
-Ross!
-Uh, just a minute, please.

33:49.833 --> 33:50.917
-[barking]
-[Tobin] Freddy!

33:53.042 --> 33:55.833
[Ross] Toby, stay close.
Don't go in there, it's private property.

33:55.917 --> 33:57.167
[Natalie] He went after Freddy.

33:59.875 --> 34:00.708
[Ross] Toby!

34:01.250 --> 34:02.458
[Natalie] Tobin!

34:02.542 --> 34:03.792
[Ross] Toby, where are ya?

34:03.875 --> 34:05.417
-[Natalie] Tobin!
-[Tobin] Freddy!

34:05.500 --> 34:07.875
[Ross] Toby, don't worry about Freddy.
Just come back to us.

34:07.958 --> 34:10.083
[Natalie] Tobin, where are you, honey?

34:10.167 --> 34:11.000
[Ross] Toby!

34:11.083 --> 34:12.292
[Tobin] Freddy!

34:15.917 --> 34:17.167
Freddy!

34:18.125 --> 34:18.958
Tobin!

34:19.500 --> 34:22.708
If you're still outside the grass,
don't come back in here!

34:22.792 --> 34:24.375
[Natalie] Tobin, where are you?

34:24.458 --> 34:25.583
[Tobin] I'm over here, Mommy.

34:25.667 --> 34:28.375
[Ross] Tobin Humbolt, didn't you hear
your mother? Come back here!

34:28.458 --> 34:29.750
[Natalie] Honey, can you see him?

34:29.833 --> 34:31.083
-Where is he?
-[Tobin] Over here!

34:31.167 --> 34:33.542
-[Ross] Sounds like he's in front of us.
-Are you Tobin's dad?

34:33.625 --> 34:35.500
[Ross] Yeah. Who are you? What's going on?

34:35.583 --> 34:38.250
-Don't come in here!
-[Ross] Little late for that, buddy.

34:38.750 --> 34:39.583
[Travis] Tobin.

34:40.375 --> 34:41.583
Where are you, Tobin?

34:43.167 --> 34:44.083
Tobin.

34:45.583 --> 34:46.917
Honey, I'm getting scared.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.333
It's only a field.

34:48.417 --> 34:50.125
That guy, though, I'm not so sure about.

34:50.208 --> 34:52.625
Toby, don't let that man get near you,
okay? Don't talk to him.

34:52.708 --> 34:53.917
If you see him, you run.

34:54.000 --> 34:55.333
[Tobin] I'm afraid, Daddy!

34:55.417 --> 34:57.708
[Natalie]
Did you hear that? He went right by us.

34:57.792 --> 34:58.958
-[Ross] No, honey, no!
-Tobin!

34:59.042 --> 35:00.625
-He went the other way!
-Tobin!

35:01.125 --> 35:01.958
[Ross] Natalie!

35:02.583 --> 35:03.583
Natalie, wait!

35:05.917 --> 35:06.833
Natalie!

35:08.417 --> 35:10.083
-[indistinct whispering]
-[Ross] Tobin?

35:11.750 --> 35:12.667
Natalie!

35:19.958 --> 35:21.417
Toby!

35:22.792 --> 35:23.875
Natalie!

35:25.833 --> 35:26.792
Toby.

35:28.458 --> 35:29.292
Natalie.

35:29.875 --> 35:32.000
[panting]

35:33.292 --> 35:35.542
Okay. Okay, Rossy boy. Hold it together.

35:36.250 --> 35:38.458
Stay positive.
That's what's gonna get you out of this.

35:39.125 --> 35:40.708
It's gonna get you out of this.

35:41.167 --> 35:43.583
"Mind that's light sells right."

35:44.708 --> 35:48.500
"Mind that's light sells right." Right?
"The mind that's light sells right."

35:49.250 --> 35:52.958
Right? "The mind that's light sells right.
The mind that's light sells right.

35:53.042 --> 35:54.000
The mind that..."

35:55.583 --> 35:57.167
Mind... Fuck.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.500
Fuck. This fucking kid. Fucking kid.

36:02.042 --> 36:02.958
Can't listen?

36:04.250 --> 36:05.750
You can't just fucking listen?

36:06.417 --> 36:09.875
Maybe if your mother acted like a mother
for once, kept an eye on you.

36:12.792 --> 36:13.708
Tobin!

36:14.917 --> 36:16.208
Natalie!

36:18.750 --> 36:19.875
[sighs]

37:29.208 --> 37:32.250
[indistinct chanting]

37:48.375 --> 37:50.708
[Tobin] Help!

37:53.333 --> 37:54.375
Help!

37:58.958 --> 37:59.792
[Becky] Hello?

38:00.583 --> 38:01.750
Is someone out there?

38:01.833 --> 38:03.333
[Tobin] Help!

38:03.417 --> 38:05.792
- I'm lost in here!
-[Becky] Sounds like he's in trouble.

38:05.875 --> 38:07.875
-I've been trying to get to the road...
-[Cal sighs]

38:07.958 --> 38:09.250
...but I can't find it!

38:09.333 --> 38:10.208
[Cal] Okay.

38:10.917 --> 38:12.250
We better haul him out.

38:14.333 --> 38:15.542
[Becky] It's really hot.

38:17.000 --> 38:19.083
[Cal] Careful.
Don't slide down into that ditch.

38:19.167 --> 38:22.125
Watch your arm. I'm gonna pull this thing
off the side of the road.

38:49.375 --> 38:50.833
[Tobin] Help me!

38:50.917 --> 38:52.292
Help me!

38:53.833 --> 38:55.292
Where are you?

38:55.375 --> 38:56.792
Are you coming?

39:14.458 --> 39:16.917
[Becky at a distance] There once was
a man named McSweeney

39:17.000 --> 39:19.375
Who spilled some gin on his weenie

39:19.458 --> 39:21.583
Just to be couth, he added vermouth

39:21.667 --> 39:23.500
And slipped his girl a martini

39:24.792 --> 39:26.125
[Cal] Oh, that's charming.

39:27.625 --> 39:31.125
[Tobin] Hey, you guys,
are you looking for me? I'm scared!

39:31.208 --> 39:33.042
[Cal] Yes. Yes. Hang on.

39:33.667 --> 39:34.583
Becky!

39:34.667 --> 39:35.917
Becky, keep talking.

39:36.417 --> 39:38.083
[Becky]
There once was a woman named Jill...

39:38.167 --> 39:41.042
-Becky?
-...Who swallowed an exploding pill

39:41.125 --> 39:43.292
They found her vagina in North Carolina--

39:43.375 --> 39:45.000
[Cal] Stop, stop. I overshot you.

39:45.083 --> 39:45.917
[Travis] Becky?

39:46.875 --> 39:47.708
Becky!

39:48.792 --> 39:50.167
Cal, are you in here?

39:51.333 --> 39:52.208
[Becky] Hello?

39:53.000 --> 39:54.875
-[gasps]
-[Becky] Is someone else out there?

39:54.958 --> 39:57.042
Becky, it's me, Travis!

39:58.042 --> 39:58.958
Travis?

39:59.417 --> 40:00.792
[Travis] I'm in here!

40:00.875 --> 40:02.208
I'm in here, too!

40:02.292 --> 40:03.125
What?

40:03.875 --> 40:06.125
[Becky] How...
How the hell did you get here?

40:06.208 --> 40:07.625
[Travis] I don't know, but I'm here.

40:07.708 --> 40:09.458
Why? Why the fuck are you here?

40:10.125 --> 40:11.167
[Travis] I...

40:11.958 --> 40:13.375
I came looking for you.

40:13.458 --> 40:15.917
But how did you get here before us?

40:16.417 --> 40:19.167
[Travis] I don't know.
But it doesn't matter now.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.583
You're here. [laughs]

40:21.667 --> 40:22.667
We're all here.

40:23.292 --> 40:24.292
It doesn't matter.

40:24.375 --> 40:25.875
[Tobin] Travis?

40:25.958 --> 40:27.250
Is that you?

40:28.167 --> 40:29.000
Tobin?

40:30.625 --> 40:31.458
You okay?

40:32.125 --> 40:33.458
I found Freddy.

40:33.958 --> 40:35.625
-He's dead.
-Freddy?

40:35.708 --> 40:37.625
-Someone killed him.
-Freddy?

40:37.708 --> 40:39.000
Who's Freddy?

40:39.083 --> 40:40.083
[Tobin] My dog.

40:40.167 --> 40:41.750
His guts are all out.

40:42.750 --> 40:43.583
Tobin...

40:45.708 --> 40:47.375
are you with Freddy now?

40:47.458 --> 40:48.333
[Tobin] Yeah.

40:48.792 --> 40:49.958
Okay.

40:50.042 --> 40:51.917
Okay, just stay where you are.

40:52.375 --> 40:53.667
Okay? Don't move.

40:53.750 --> 40:55.083
We're gonna come to you.

40:55.875 --> 40:56.792
All right? Just...

40:57.333 --> 40:58.417
just keep talking.

40:58.792 --> 41:01.167
Do you hear that? Becky? Cal?

41:01.250 --> 41:03.042
Yeah, but we already tried that.

41:03.125 --> 41:04.667
And it didn't work.

41:05.125 --> 41:06.917
[Travis]
Well, this time, I think it might.

41:07.000 --> 41:08.958
Follow Tobin's voice, okay?

41:09.042 --> 41:09.875
Tobin?

41:09.958 --> 41:11.000
Start talking!

41:11.875 --> 41:13.333
[Tobin] Like what Becky was doing?

41:13.417 --> 41:14.250
Yeah.

41:14.750 --> 41:16.750
-Yeah, just like that.
-Okay.

41:17.458 --> 41:20.375
There once was a man named McSweeney

41:20.875 --> 41:23.417
Who spilled some gin on his weenie?

41:23.500 --> 41:25.708
Just to be couth, he...

41:26.500 --> 41:27.833
Um...

41:27.917 --> 41:29.750
I forgot the next part.

41:30.583 --> 41:33.333
He put something on his weenie

41:33.917 --> 41:37.875
Uh... And then slipped his girl a martini?

41:38.792 --> 41:40.333
What's a martini?

41:40.417 --> 41:41.667
[panting]

41:44.458 --> 41:45.583
It's a drink.

41:46.167 --> 41:47.208
You're Travis?

41:49.083 --> 41:52.250
And that's a dirty rhyme, not for kids.

42:03.625 --> 42:05.167
-[Cal] Becky!
-[Becky] Oh!

42:05.250 --> 42:06.458
-Thank God!
-Oh, God!

42:06.542 --> 42:07.583
[both panting]

42:07.667 --> 42:09.667
It's okay. It's okay.

42:10.458 --> 42:12.250
[flies buzzing]

42:13.167 --> 42:14.708
What the fuck is going on?

42:15.708 --> 42:16.583
The field...

42:17.667 --> 42:19.083
it doesn't move dead things.

42:19.625 --> 42:21.125
That doesn't make any sense.

42:21.208 --> 42:22.833
Name one thing in here that does.

42:22.917 --> 42:25.125
So, explain to us again how you got here.

42:26.500 --> 42:27.417
I followed you.

42:28.833 --> 42:31.417
You must have been right on our asses
the whole way.

42:31.500 --> 42:33.375
Oh, no, no. I came after.

42:34.250 --> 42:35.083
After what?

42:36.083 --> 42:36.917
After...

42:39.250 --> 42:40.750
you didn't show up in San Diego.

42:42.250 --> 42:44.375
We just left two days ago.

42:44.458 --> 42:45.292
No.

42:45.375 --> 42:48.875
No, it was longer than that.
It was more like... two months.

42:50.167 --> 42:52.417
Now, that really doesn't make any sense.

42:52.500 --> 42:54.583
I think we have to focus
on how the hell we get out.

42:54.667 --> 42:57.500
Well, I'm not making Becky
blindly walk through Wonderland anymore.

42:57.583 --> 42:59.917
-We need some kind of plan.
-Well, we can't just sit here.

43:00.000 --> 43:01.542
-[groans]
-Are you okay?

43:03.083 --> 43:03.958
Yeah, fine.

43:05.458 --> 43:07.458
[indistinct whispering]

43:12.083 --> 43:13.917
-I think we have to get moving.
-[Becky] Yeah.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.625
No, I agree. Let's just go.

43:15.708 --> 43:17.333
-Well, in which direction?
-I don't know!

43:17.667 --> 43:19.083
In any direction.

43:19.167 --> 43:20.625
Why? What's the point?

43:20.708 --> 43:23.000
The point is I don't want to stay here.

43:23.083 --> 43:24.542
Someone is watching us.

43:25.750 --> 43:26.750
I can feel it.

43:28.042 --> 43:28.917
Okay.

43:29.833 --> 43:30.667
[Travis] Tobin,

43:31.042 --> 43:32.792
-hop on my shoulders.
-Okay.

43:34.167 --> 43:35.000
[Travis grunts]

43:36.167 --> 43:37.417
Okay.

43:38.208 --> 43:39.083
Okay.

43:40.250 --> 43:42.125
Do you see anything other than grass?

43:42.208 --> 43:43.250
No.

43:43.333 --> 43:44.708
Just grass...

43:45.250 --> 43:46.625
and more grass.

43:49.167 --> 43:50.583
-Wait!
-[Travis] What?

43:51.083 --> 43:52.583
I think I see something.

43:52.667 --> 43:54.625
It's a building, I think.

43:55.417 --> 43:56.458
That church?

43:56.542 --> 43:59.375
No, I can't tell. It's too far away.

44:00.500 --> 44:02.667
-Okay, which way is it?
-That way.

44:14.042 --> 44:17.625
[Cal] So, you saw our car at the church
and you didn't call anybody?

44:18.083 --> 44:19.667
[Travis] No, Cal, I didn't.

44:20.125 --> 44:21.375
You still see it?

44:21.458 --> 44:22.583
Getting closer.

44:25.917 --> 44:30.083
I don't suppose you, um, told anyone
where you were headed, did you?

44:31.500 --> 44:32.333
No.

44:33.458 --> 44:34.875
Not that it'll make much difference.

44:36.375 --> 44:37.750
Somebody'll look for us.

44:38.708 --> 44:40.333
Your folks are worried sick.

44:40.958 --> 44:43.583
What could they do?
You ask me, I don't think anyone's coming.

44:44.542 --> 44:45.500
You did.

44:48.292 --> 44:49.167
Yeah, and...

44:50.417 --> 44:52.417
everyone thought I was crazy for trying.

44:56.458 --> 44:58.708
Yeah. It's been a while since I checked.

45:00.583 --> 45:02.667
[static crackling]

45:02.750 --> 45:03.875
-[groans]
-Are you okay?

45:03.958 --> 45:04.875
[Becky] Mm-hmm.

45:05.583 --> 45:07.125
[sighs] Fine. Just, um...

45:08.208 --> 45:09.167
Just a kick...

45:09.833 --> 45:10.750
I think.

45:10.833 --> 45:12.500
Is the baby coming soon?

45:13.333 --> 45:14.667
She's due in three months.

45:16.125 --> 45:17.500
-She?
-[Becky] Yeah.

45:18.125 --> 45:19.625
Didn't wanna wait to find out.

45:20.333 --> 45:22.375
Ginny is what I'm calling her.

45:22.458 --> 45:25.542
For now, anyways,
after my great aunt Virginia.

45:26.125 --> 45:27.000
Ginny.

45:27.917 --> 45:29.083
You don't like it?

45:29.792 --> 45:31.250
No. No, it's...

45:32.958 --> 45:33.792
It's cool.

45:34.292 --> 45:35.167
Old-school.

45:35.750 --> 45:37.500
Yeah. She's lively.

45:40.167 --> 45:41.250
Moves around a lot.

45:43.667 --> 45:44.542
Here.

45:47.250 --> 45:48.375
[Travis gasps]

45:48.458 --> 45:49.292
-Whoa!
-[Becky laughs]

45:49.625 --> 45:50.458
Wow.

45:50.833 --> 45:51.875
[laughs]

45:52.458 --> 45:53.792
Lively is the word for it.

45:54.417 --> 45:55.250
Yeah.

45:58.625 --> 46:02.458
[phone rings]

46:06.208 --> 46:07.042
Hello?

46:08.208 --> 46:10.583
[Becky over phone]
<i>Don't let Cal hurt Travis!</i>

46:11.167 --> 46:12.375
<i>Don't leave him!</i>

46:12.458 --> 46:13.792
<i>Just stay with him.</i>

46:14.500 --> 46:17.542
<i>Or else we're gonna keep making</i>
<i>the same mistake!</i>

46:17.625 --> 46:19.292
Hello? Who is this?

46:20.708 --> 46:22.292
Hello? What's going on?

46:23.167 --> 46:25.167
[cries frantically]

46:26.875 --> 46:27.875
[screaming]

46:32.500 --> 46:33.708
What the hell was that?

46:35.083 --> 46:36.792
One more reason to keep moving.

46:37.208 --> 46:38.042
[Becky] Yeah.

47:09.333 --> 47:10.792
[cawing]

47:44.292 --> 47:45.208
[sniffs]

47:49.917 --> 47:51.167
[distorted scream]

47:54.375 --> 47:56.167
[chuckling]

48:05.125 --> 48:07.042
[screaming]

48:25.000 --> 48:26.167
Becky!

48:26.875 --> 48:27.750
Becky?

48:28.167 --> 48:29.042
[gasps]

48:33.833 --> 48:34.917
[Travis] Becky!

48:35.000 --> 48:35.833
Beck!

48:35.917 --> 48:36.750
Becky! Beck.

48:36.833 --> 48:37.833
-Becky!
-[Cal] Wake up!

48:37.917 --> 48:40.042
-Move. Move! Move!
-Hey!

48:40.125 --> 48:42.167
Hey! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

48:42.833 --> 48:44.125
[grunting]

48:49.125 --> 48:50.500
[gasps]

48:50.917 --> 48:51.875
-[coughs]
-Okay.

48:51.958 --> 48:53.542
-No, no, no.
-Come here.

48:53.625 --> 48:54.542
-It's okay.
-Come here.

48:54.625 --> 48:56.042
-Daddy!
-Toby! Oh, thank God.

48:56.125 --> 48:58.167
Toby, thank God! Oh!

49:00.000 --> 49:02.250
-The baby's moving.
-Hey, you okay?

49:02.333 --> 49:06.000
It's probably just her condition
and a touch of heatstroke. That's all.

49:06.083 --> 49:07.083
She's gonna be fine.

49:07.792 --> 49:08.625
We all are.

49:09.250 --> 49:11.583
You're Ross. You're... Tobin's dad.

49:11.667 --> 49:12.958
Yeah. [chuckles]

49:13.042 --> 49:15.208
Hey, don't worry.
Your mother, she's out there.

49:15.292 --> 49:17.708
We're gonna find her,
and then we're leaving.

49:17.792 --> 49:18.667
All of us.

49:19.208 --> 49:20.250
You found a way out?

49:20.667 --> 49:23.875
Yeah, I got to the road, but I wasn't
gonna leave without my family.

49:24.542 --> 49:25.417
How?

49:26.875 --> 49:29.417
Well, it's not a straight line.
I can say that much.

49:29.500 --> 49:32.208
-Which way were you headed?
-Towards that building.

49:32.583 --> 49:34.333
-Building?
-We were almost there.

49:35.833 --> 49:36.750
Come here.

49:37.708 --> 49:40.125
[Travis] All right, come on.
Up on my shoulders, Tobin.

49:50.250 --> 49:51.333
It's gone.

49:51.958 --> 49:54.250
[Ross] That's the way
things work around here.

49:54.667 --> 49:57.042
But I got the golden ticket,
for any takers.

49:57.125 --> 49:58.333
[chuckles]

50:08.917 --> 50:10.917
[Ross singing "Midnight Special"]

50:51.417 --> 50:52.875
Is that CCR?

50:53.792 --> 50:55.250
Well, folk song, originally.

50:57.958 --> 50:59.792
Let me guess. Lead singer in a band?

51:00.958 --> 51:03.500
Four-piece,
with a weekly gig at the local?

51:03.792 --> 51:04.667
-Kinda.
-Hmm.

51:05.750 --> 51:08.417
I'm a good judge of people.
You gotta be, in my field.

51:09.292 --> 51:10.708
Field! [chuckles]

51:12.458 --> 51:14.125
Yeah, real estate's my game.

51:14.958 --> 51:17.833
We were on a little family vacay
through the heartland.

51:18.958 --> 51:21.042
It was going pretty well
till we ran into you.

51:21.500 --> 51:22.458
I...

51:22.875 --> 51:24.042
tried to warn you.

51:24.125 --> 51:26.000
I'm just giving you a hard time,
that's all.

51:27.417 --> 51:28.292
[exhales]

51:29.167 --> 51:30.542
I know it's not your fault.

51:31.042 --> 51:32.125
Fate conspired.

51:33.125 --> 51:35.000
Isn't that always the way? [chuckles]

51:35.708 --> 51:37.708
You know, believe it or not,
before I ended up here,

51:37.792 --> 51:39.958
before, uh, real estate was my game,

51:40.625 --> 51:42.375
I played a mean guitar...

51:43.458 --> 51:44.500
in a gospel band.

51:45.375 --> 51:46.208
Yeah.

51:46.292 --> 51:50.042
Me and my Gibson and Jesus
were gonna rock the world.

51:51.875 --> 51:54.750
But, you know,
got married and had a kid, and...

51:55.500 --> 51:56.917
Those were the days, though.

51:57.292 --> 52:00.875
Still, nothin', but nothin'
compares to this.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
What the hell is it?

52:18.750 --> 52:20.083
See for yourself.

52:23.458 --> 52:24.792
There's carvings on it.

52:26.167 --> 52:27.667
They look really old.

52:28.000 --> 52:28.875
Are those native?

52:28.958 --> 52:31.208
[Ross] Oh, I think it's a safe bet
it's been here

52:31.292 --> 52:34.042
since before the Kiowa hunted
on the Osage Cuestas.

52:35.792 --> 52:36.750
Older than the hills.

52:37.167 --> 52:42.250
Probably was here before the glaciers came
and carried the hills away.

52:43.083 --> 52:47.167
You realize we're in the center
of the contiguous United States.

52:48.875 --> 52:50.958
Smack-dab in the middle of the continent.

52:51.833 --> 52:55.083
Ah, hell, I'd hazard this stone...

52:56.000 --> 52:58.500
is the center of the center.

52:58.583 --> 53:00.958
We didn't come here
for a goddamn sightseeing tour.

53:02.042 --> 53:03.792
You were gonna show us the way out.

53:05.167 --> 53:07.125
Oh, but darlin', I have.

53:08.042 --> 53:09.167
You just have to look.

53:12.083 --> 53:13.542
[inhales deeply]

53:22.083 --> 53:25.375
Is there a map on it or something?

53:25.458 --> 53:27.833
Just put your hand on it and you'll know.

53:29.042 --> 53:30.500
What's that supposed to mean?

53:33.167 --> 53:34.833
[indistinct whispering]

53:36.500 --> 53:39.792
[indistinct chanting]

53:44.000 --> 53:45.208
[screeching]

53:45.292 --> 53:46.500
Stop!

53:47.333 --> 53:49.542
-[gasps] Nat?
-Mommy!

53:50.000 --> 53:51.500
Come here. Oh!

53:51.583 --> 53:52.917
Been looking everywhere for you.

53:54.125 --> 53:57.458
-Thank God you're all right.
-Stay away! Stay away from us!

53:59.583 --> 54:03.083
Whatever he told you,
whatever he said to you, he's lying!

54:03.167 --> 54:05.208
What? What are you talking about?

54:05.792 --> 54:06.750
You know.

54:07.417 --> 54:10.458
All I know, all I care about,
is that we're finally together.

54:10.792 --> 54:12.417
Everything's gonna be
all right now, honey.

54:12.500 --> 54:13.625
[gasps]

54:14.375 --> 54:15.292
Now what is it?

54:18.625 --> 54:20.375
-What is it, honey?
-I saw...

54:21.042 --> 54:21.917
I saw her.

54:22.875 --> 54:23.708
She was...

54:25.083 --> 54:26.042
She was...

54:27.542 --> 54:28.375
She was...

54:29.292 --> 54:30.333
She was what?

54:32.875 --> 54:34.667
She was what? Just say it.

54:35.458 --> 54:36.292
She wasn't...

54:37.000 --> 54:38.458
She wasn't alive.

54:39.958 --> 54:42.458
[sobs] I saw her on the ground
some ways back.

54:42.542 --> 54:44.000
I saw her, I'm sure.

54:44.083 --> 54:45.458
I'm sure I saw her.

54:46.000 --> 54:46.833
Toby...

54:47.708 --> 54:49.750
Mommy's just a little confused right now.

54:50.292 --> 54:51.417
Why wouldn't she be?

54:51.917 --> 54:53.708
Days without food or water.

54:53.792 --> 54:55.000
I am not confused.

54:55.083 --> 54:57.875
I saw her. I saw her, and you...

54:59.125 --> 55:00.042
You were...

55:00.958 --> 55:02.375
[sobbing] You were gonna...

55:03.708 --> 55:04.708
I was gonna what?

55:06.375 --> 55:08.000
[sobs] You were gonna hurt me.

55:08.625 --> 55:09.583
Hurt you?

55:10.792 --> 55:12.417
-How could you even think that?
-[groans]

55:12.500 --> 55:13.750
We're all in this together.

55:14.375 --> 55:15.667
We're like a family now.

55:16.292 --> 55:18.083
Right, Travis? We solid?

55:18.542 --> 55:19.833
[gasping]

55:39.542 --> 55:40.542
We have to go.

55:41.125 --> 55:42.250
We have to go.

55:44.333 --> 55:46.458
Look, thanks for your help,
mister, but, uh...

55:47.333 --> 55:49.333
I think we're gonna go
our own way now...

55:51.167 --> 55:52.583
Do you wanna come with us?

55:54.792 --> 55:56.917
No, just a minute. Just hear me out.

55:58.667 --> 55:59.500
This rock,

56:00.208 --> 56:02.458
once you touch it, you'll know.

56:02.833 --> 56:05.042
It's like a... whoosh!

56:05.125 --> 56:06.583
It's... It's better than anything.

56:06.667 --> 56:08.167
It's like accepting the host.

56:08.625 --> 56:11.458
I know that sounds like blasphemy,
but it's true.

56:11.542 --> 56:13.083
You think this is just chance?

56:13.542 --> 56:15.708
Folks are brought into the grass
for a reason.

56:15.792 --> 56:18.625
We're all here
because we've got stuff to work out.

56:19.292 --> 56:21.625
And this rock, in its wisdom,

56:21.708 --> 56:24.625
brought our two families together
to do just that.

56:24.708 --> 56:26.625
All it's asking for is a little faith.

56:27.625 --> 56:32.417
Five little fingers on its face
and you will be redeemed!

56:32.833 --> 56:37.625
All your sins, all your trespasses,
all your regrets will melt away

56:37.708 --> 56:40.000
and the world will open up like a flower!

56:40.375 --> 56:42.125
Oh, it's a beautiful thing.

56:43.042 --> 56:44.667
You gotta trust me on this.

56:45.333 --> 56:46.208
[whimpers]

56:49.042 --> 56:50.542
I think you should let her go.

56:54.792 --> 56:55.625
Or what?

57:04.583 --> 57:06.250
Look, you don't have the advantage here.

57:06.792 --> 57:07.917
Is that a threat?

57:09.625 --> 57:10.875
It's pretty simple math.

57:11.333 --> 57:13.208
If you think I was doing the soft sell

57:13.292 --> 57:15.625
because I was afraid
of going the other way,

57:16.667 --> 57:18.250
well, you got another think comin'.

57:18.625 --> 57:20.958
It's better that you come to the rock
on your own.

57:21.042 --> 57:23.208
Open your heart to it, like I did.

57:25.500 --> 57:26.792
Now, what I really wanna know...

57:28.250 --> 57:30.125
is how did you get here?

57:30.542 --> 57:33.917
Because the rock wouldn't let you find us
unless it wanted you to.

57:34.625 --> 57:35.708
[Natalie whimpers]

57:35.792 --> 57:37.833
Unless this isn't about you.

57:42.042 --> 57:42.917
Right.

57:44.083 --> 57:45.000
I get it.

57:47.083 --> 57:48.500
This is about me.

57:57.292 --> 57:58.667
Looking for the hard sell?

57:59.750 --> 58:00.792
Yeah.

58:00.875 --> 58:01.708
Sure, I'm game.

58:01.792 --> 58:03.208
-[Natalie whimpers]
-Travis!

58:03.292 --> 58:04.208
-No!
-[yells]

58:04.625 --> 58:05.625
-No!
-Go!

58:08.708 --> 58:10.583
-No!
-Go!

58:12.458 --> 58:14.000
Travis! [screams]

58:15.875 --> 58:18.000
Stop! Stop!

58:18.083 --> 58:19.958
[groans and screams]

58:20.042 --> 58:21.875
-Cal! Cal!
-No. Come with--

58:22.292 --> 58:23.417
Cal, help him!

58:23.708 --> 58:25.292
-Please!
-I'm no fibber.

58:26.417 --> 58:30.083
When you touch that rock,
you'll know everything I know.

58:30.167 --> 58:33.000
Everything the grass knows,
including how to leave.

58:33.375 --> 58:35.333
Only, you won't want to.

58:35.792 --> 58:37.125
[screams]

58:38.333 --> 58:40.167
Tobin! Run! Run!

58:40.250 --> 58:42.250
-[grunts]
-[screams]

58:42.333 --> 58:43.208
[groans]

58:43.292 --> 58:45.625
-Mom! No!
-[screaming] No!

58:47.167 --> 58:48.875
-No!
-Mommy!

58:48.958 --> 58:50.458
-Mommy!
-[screams]

58:50.542 --> 58:51.583
-No.
-[sobs]

58:51.667 --> 58:52.625
Don't worry, son.

58:53.292 --> 58:55.167
-It's just flesh.
-[Tobin] Mommy!

58:55.250 --> 58:57.083
-And all flesh is grass.
-No!

58:57.750 --> 58:59.000
[screams]

58:59.958 --> 59:01.208
[growls]

59:02.958 --> 59:04.083
[screams]

59:04.167 --> 59:05.875
Mommy! No!

59:07.000 --> 59:08.542
[sobbing] Mommy! No!

59:09.458 --> 59:10.458
-Mommy!
-[gasps]

59:10.542 --> 59:12.000
Mommy!

59:12.542 --> 59:13.708
[wailing]

59:13.792 --> 59:15.500
Go! Go! Get out!

59:21.333 --> 59:22.750
[breathes heavily]

59:24.167 --> 59:26.167
[indistinct chanting]

59:28.167 --> 59:29.250
[Becky panting]

59:29.333 --> 59:31.000
[Ross] Save your breath, kids.

59:31.583 --> 59:33.583
You can't run from redemption.

59:34.625 --> 59:36.250
[groaning]

59:36.833 --> 59:39.000
He's right, you know?
Where are we gonna go?

59:41.000 --> 59:41.875
Freddy!

59:41.958 --> 59:42.792
[Travis] Come on!

59:47.792 --> 59:48.792
[panting]

59:56.875 --> 59:58.708
[Tobin] Come on! Hurry!

59:58.792 --> 1:00:00.792
[all panting]

1:00:04.833 --> 1:00:05.667
[Travis] Cal!

1:00:06.500 --> 1:00:08.500
[Travis and Cal grunting]

1:00:17.625 --> 1:00:18.792
[Cal] What are we gonna do?

1:00:19.333 --> 1:00:21.375
He'll find us. For sure, he'll find us.

1:00:21.458 --> 1:00:23.333
[Travis] Listen to me.
First thing we have to do

1:00:23.417 --> 1:00:24.875
is you need to take hold of my hand.

1:00:24.958 --> 1:00:25.958
[Becky] It's okay, Tobin.

1:00:26.042 --> 1:00:28.417
[Tobin] My daddy's right. We're grass.

1:00:28.833 --> 1:00:30.583
We keep dying and coming back.

1:00:30.667 --> 1:00:32.917
-Like Freddy did.
-One, two...

1:00:33.625 --> 1:00:35.125
-[cracks]
-[screams]

1:00:36.833 --> 1:00:37.833
[Cal] Here.

1:00:37.917 --> 1:00:39.042
[grunts]

1:00:39.458 --> 1:00:41.292
-[screams]
-[panting] Come here.

1:00:41.708 --> 1:00:43.167
-Come here.
-[groans]

1:00:43.250 --> 1:00:45.542
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

1:00:45.625 --> 1:00:46.875
-[Travis groaning]
-Okay.

1:00:47.667 --> 1:00:50.292
-I didn't know what to do.
-Yeah, you sure didn't.

1:00:52.500 --> 1:00:54.958
Well, we wouldn't be in this mess
if it wasn't for you.

1:00:55.042 --> 1:00:57.708
Okay, blaming each other
isn't gonna solve anything.

1:00:57.792 --> 1:01:00.875
Well, all indicators are
that there's no way to solve this.

1:01:01.292 --> 1:01:03.208
If we're just gonna go
round and round in circles,

1:01:03.292 --> 1:01:05.708
I'll feel a lot better saying
what we all know.

1:01:06.042 --> 1:01:07.458
It's not that simple.

1:01:07.542 --> 1:01:09.958
Are you forgetting the detail
that he completely abandoned you?

1:01:10.333 --> 1:01:11.708
That he totally threw you away?

1:01:11.792 --> 1:01:13.917
That he wanted you
to abort your own baby?

1:01:18.458 --> 1:01:19.417
[Travis] Becky...

1:01:20.208 --> 1:01:21.875
I'm sorry. [sighs]

1:01:23.458 --> 1:01:25.292
-I just wanted...
-You just wanted to what?

1:01:26.917 --> 1:01:27.958
Look after me?

1:01:28.542 --> 1:01:29.625
Protect me?

1:01:30.125 --> 1:01:31.167
I need food.

1:01:31.458 --> 1:01:33.667
I need water. I need a place to sleep.

1:01:34.167 --> 1:01:36.875
What I don't need
is any more brotherly love.

1:01:39.042 --> 1:01:41.042
[Travis] No. Cal's right.

1:01:41.833 --> 1:01:42.917
I was an asshole.

1:01:43.792 --> 1:01:45.250
And I made a mistake.

1:01:45.917 --> 1:01:46.917
A big one.

1:01:48.208 --> 1:01:50.625
But that's not the real reason
you don't like me.

1:01:50.958 --> 1:01:52.125
-Is it, Cal?
-[sighs]

1:01:53.042 --> 1:01:54.125
It's a good start.

1:01:54.208 --> 1:01:57.375
No, it's a good excuse,
but it's not the reason.

1:01:57.458 --> 1:02:00.208
You didn't want me around
even before there was a baby.

1:02:00.292 --> 1:02:01.875
The truth is, there's nothing

1:02:02.333 --> 1:02:03.958
that I could have done
to make you like me,

1:02:04.042 --> 1:02:07.000
because no one is ever gonna be
good enough for your little sister.

1:02:07.083 --> 1:02:09.250
-A high school diploma would be nice.
-You know what?

1:02:09.333 --> 1:02:11.250
I'm not quite the fuckup
that you think I am!

1:02:11.333 --> 1:02:14.750
Oh, no. No, no. You're a real rock star.

1:02:14.833 --> 1:02:18.542
You've sacrificed everything
for that ridiculous, infantile fantasy,

1:02:18.625 --> 1:02:20.375
and now we're all suffering for it.

1:02:20.458 --> 1:02:21.417
And you're a real hero.

1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:23.208
Playing hubby to your little sister?

1:02:23.292 --> 1:02:26.458
That's the next best thing to fucking her,
which is what you really want, isn't it?

1:02:26.958 --> 1:02:28.208
Guys, stop it!

1:02:29.083 --> 1:02:29.958
Stop it!

1:02:30.625 --> 1:02:31.500
Stop it!

1:02:31.875 --> 1:02:33.250
[banging]

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:35.542
[crashing]

1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:37.042
[Ross] Open up!

1:02:37.125 --> 1:02:38.083
Come on, this way!

1:02:40.167 --> 1:02:41.583
[Ross] Redemption is coming!

1:02:41.667 --> 1:02:42.917
-[groaning]
-Come on.

1:02:49.625 --> 1:02:51.833
[grunting]

1:02:54.542 --> 1:02:56.708
[panting]

1:02:59.333 --> 1:03:00.167
You okay?

1:03:01.292 --> 1:03:02.167
Come on, hurry!

1:03:03.292 --> 1:03:04.292
-Get the door!
-[Cal] Yeah.

1:03:05.083 --> 1:03:06.083
[grunting]

1:03:07.833 --> 1:03:08.708
[Travis] Okay.

1:03:09.042 --> 1:03:11.208
He's not gonna get through that
without a sledgehammer.

1:03:11.292 --> 1:03:12.958
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

1:03:15.042 --> 1:03:16.667
What are we gonna do? We're stuck up here!

1:03:16.750 --> 1:03:20.292
No, listen to me. When I drove here,
I saw this building from the road.

1:03:20.375 --> 1:03:21.792
[Becky] We saw it, too.

1:03:21.875 --> 1:03:24.333
Yeah. The church,
it was just on the other side.

1:03:25.458 --> 1:03:26.292
Okay.

1:03:27.833 --> 1:03:29.167
-Are you okay?
-Mm-hmm.

1:03:29.250 --> 1:03:30.208
Yeah, it's fine.

1:03:33.708 --> 1:03:35.708
My God, there it is.

1:03:36.625 --> 1:03:37.792
Spitting distance.

1:03:38.333 --> 1:03:41.792
Only thing is, we go in that grass again
and we're back to square one.

1:03:42.958 --> 1:03:43.958
[panting]

1:03:47.250 --> 1:03:48.083
Freddy?

1:03:50.333 --> 1:03:52.167
Fucking dog gives me the creeps.

1:03:55.917 --> 1:03:56.833
Where'd he go?

1:04:13.083 --> 1:04:14.958
There, on the road.

1:04:18.250 --> 1:04:19.083
A hole.

1:04:20.542 --> 1:04:21.375
There's a hole.

1:04:21.458 --> 1:04:23.583
The way out? You think that's it?

1:04:23.667 --> 1:04:25.958
Maybe. But we're not there yet--

1:04:26.042 --> 1:04:27.500
[grunts]

1:04:31.375 --> 1:04:33.375
[indistinct whispering]

1:04:39.375 --> 1:04:41.542
-[thuds]
-[pants]

1:04:49.250 --> 1:04:50.083
Tobin.

1:04:54.792 --> 1:04:55.708
Tobin, I...

1:04:56.042 --> 1:04:58.500
[Ross singing "Midnight Special"]

1:05:03.500 --> 1:05:04.875
Becky, we've gotta get out of here.

1:05:07.167 --> 1:05:08.208
[Becky] Where's Travis?

1:05:09.875 --> 1:05:10.708
He's coming.

1:05:14.333 --> 1:05:16.500
Holes are everywhere, Calvin, my boy.

1:05:20.667 --> 1:05:22.000
Life's full of 'em!

1:05:25.667 --> 1:05:26.875
[Becky] Tobin, come back!

1:05:27.917 --> 1:05:30.083
-Travis!
<i>-</i>Beck, we have to keep moving!

1:05:30.167 --> 1:05:31.583
[pants] We can't just leave!

1:05:31.667 --> 1:05:33.792
I'll come back for him,
but we have to get you out!

1:05:33.875 --> 1:05:36.083
I found a way. It's... It's right there.

1:05:36.792 --> 1:05:37.625
[Becky] Travis!

1:05:37.708 --> 1:05:39.167
-We're so close!
-Travis!

1:05:39.250 --> 1:05:40.208
Beck, I'm your brother,

1:05:40.292 --> 1:05:43.333
and I'm telling you right now
to forget about that asshole.

1:05:49.542 --> 1:05:50.750
Did you do something?

1:05:52.500 --> 1:05:53.917
[sighs] Beck.

1:05:54.875 --> 1:05:55.708
I love you.

1:05:55.792 --> 1:05:57.167
-Get away from me.
-Beck.

1:05:57.583 --> 1:05:58.417
-No, wait.
-[groans]

1:05:58.500 --> 1:05:59.708
-Beck, wait.
-No...

1:06:00.042 --> 1:06:01.125
-Beck, please.
-No...

1:06:01.208 --> 1:06:02.792
Please, Beck. Wait.

1:06:03.500 --> 1:06:06.292
Thought that you would lose your sister
when you got out of here.

1:06:06.375 --> 1:06:09.833
That the baby would bring her and Travis
together, you'd be left out in the cold.

1:06:10.292 --> 1:06:12.333
You're probably right on that score.

1:06:12.417 --> 1:06:14.625
Your mistake is thinking
you're ever leaving.

1:06:15.958 --> 1:06:17.042
[panting]

1:06:28.417 --> 1:06:29.333
[screams]

1:06:29.417 --> 1:06:31.333
-I'm impressed. Yeah.
-[grunting]

1:06:32.042 --> 1:06:34.292
Of course, I was a bit of a track star
back in the day.

1:06:34.875 --> 1:06:36.250
Played some ball, too.

1:06:36.333 --> 1:06:38.375
-[screams]
-[grunts] I know.

1:06:38.458 --> 1:06:39.833
I know. I know.

1:06:40.542 --> 1:06:44.333
You're thinking if you had just
turned left instead of right,

1:06:44.417 --> 1:06:45.792
you could've gotten away from me.

1:06:45.875 --> 1:06:47.000
But you did go left,

1:06:47.583 --> 1:06:49.333
-and you turned right.
-[grunts]

1:06:49.417 --> 1:06:51.208
And you kept running
and didn't turn at all.

1:06:51.292 --> 1:06:52.750
[sobbing]

1:06:52.833 --> 1:06:53.708
But here,

1:06:54.250 --> 1:06:57.417
in the garden of forking paths,

1:06:58.250 --> 1:06:59.750
you didn't make any one choice.

1:07:01.167 --> 1:07:02.417
You made every choice.

1:07:03.542 --> 1:07:04.917
And they all led back to me.

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:05.917
[panting]

1:07:08.458 --> 1:07:09.917
[screaming]

1:07:37.208 --> 1:07:38.167
[Becky] Travis?

1:07:40.167 --> 1:07:41.208
Travis!

1:07:43.167 --> 1:07:44.000
Becky?

1:07:46.292 --> 1:07:48.000
[panting]

1:07:49.500 --> 1:07:51.333
[groans]

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.042
Becky?

1:07:56.542 --> 1:07:58.250
[groaning]

1:07:59.375 --> 1:08:00.208
Becky?

1:08:04.083 --> 1:08:05.208
Becky?

1:08:07.958 --> 1:08:09.917
[Becky groaning]

1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:10.958
[groaning]

1:08:13.083 --> 1:08:13.958
[Travis] Becky?

1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:15.917
Travis?

1:08:16.833 --> 1:08:17.667
[Travis] You okay?

1:08:18.292 --> 1:08:20.333
[breathing heavily]

1:08:20.417 --> 1:08:21.417
I'm scared.

1:08:23.083 --> 1:08:24.708
Travis, where are you?

1:08:26.667 --> 1:08:27.917
What happened?

1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:28.917
Your brother...

1:08:29.917 --> 1:08:30.750
[sobs]

1:08:33.667 --> 1:08:35.625
I think he loves you a little too much.

1:08:36.833 --> 1:08:38.250
But this isn't his fault.

1:08:40.333 --> 1:08:41.250
I did this.

1:08:44.083 --> 1:08:46.333
I had my chance with you,
and I threw it away.

1:08:48.292 --> 1:08:49.333
Whatever happens...

1:08:50.583 --> 1:08:51.750
I want you to know I...

1:08:52.583 --> 1:08:54.250
I'm glad you didn't listen to me.

1:08:56.708 --> 1:08:57.958
I'm glad you kept Ginny.

1:09:04.708 --> 1:09:05.583
Becky?

1:09:07.750 --> 1:09:08.792
[sighs]

1:09:10.667 --> 1:09:11.500
There's, um...

1:09:16.250 --> 1:09:18.458
There's something I didn't tell you.

1:09:22.917 --> 1:09:24.375
I was gonna give her up.

1:09:25.667 --> 1:09:27.042
I got scared.

1:09:29.708 --> 1:09:31.667
I didn't think I was ready to be a mom.

1:09:33.167 --> 1:09:36.417
That's why we were, um,
going to San Diego.

1:09:38.583 --> 1:09:40.125
There was a family there.

1:09:40.625 --> 1:09:42.583
-You don't want that anymore?
-[groans]

1:09:44.208 --> 1:09:46.083
What difference does it make now?

1:09:47.500 --> 1:09:48.917
We're gonna get out of here.

1:09:49.458 --> 1:09:51.958
I'm gonna find a way.
Our baby deserves to live.

1:09:53.583 --> 1:09:55.417
[laughs] She's a strong one.

1:09:58.042 --> 1:09:59.542
I feel her kicking.

1:10:02.292 --> 1:10:04.333
I wish I could just touch your hand.

1:10:05.250 --> 1:10:06.500
It's right here.

1:10:15.833 --> 1:10:16.708
-[screams]
-Becky?

1:10:16.792 --> 1:10:17.917
Get away from me!

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:20.083
-Becky, what's going on?
-[screaming]

1:10:20.167 --> 1:10:22.167
-[screaming]
-[grunting]

1:10:23.208 --> 1:10:26.792
How funny. This is where I tussled
with Natalie for the first time.

1:10:26.875 --> 1:10:29.583
I tried to show her the way,
but she just wouldn't listen.

1:10:29.667 --> 1:10:31.208
-[yelling]
-Come on.

1:10:31.292 --> 1:10:33.292
[Becky grunting]

1:10:37.667 --> 1:10:39.750
You wanna touch the rock, darlin'?

1:10:40.250 --> 1:10:41.125
Huh?

1:10:41.958 --> 1:10:43.250
[breathing heavily]

1:10:43.333 --> 1:10:44.792
You wanna lay on it naked?

1:10:45.792 --> 1:10:47.292
Wanna feel me in you?

1:10:48.458 --> 1:10:51.333
Beneath the pinwheel stars

1:10:51.417 --> 1:10:54.875
while the grass sings our names?

1:10:55.250 --> 1:10:57.125
[crying]

1:10:58.000 --> 1:10:59.208
It's poetry, huh?

1:11:01.458 --> 1:11:02.542
Blood is nice,

1:11:04.208 --> 1:11:09.208
but tears are better
for an old, thirsty rock like that.

1:11:12.292 --> 1:11:14.125
-It has to be quick, though.
-[thunder rumbling]

1:11:14.417 --> 1:11:16.208
Don't wanna do it in front of the kid.

1:11:20.333 --> 1:11:22.500
[screams]

1:11:24.917 --> 1:11:26.458

No! No! [screaming]

1:13:01.042 --> 1:13:02.292
No!

1:13:06.042 --> 1:13:08.333
[Becky continues screaming]

1:13:08.417 --> 1:13:10.083
[chanting continues]

1:13:13.125 --> 1:13:15.083

[inhales sharply]

1:14:04.875 --> 1:14:06.417
Travis!

1:14:11.292 --> 1:14:12.250
Travis!

1:14:20.875 --> 1:14:22.583
[ringing]

1:14:25.708 --> 1:14:26.833
[Becky over phone] <i>Hello?</i>

1:14:27.625 --> 1:14:29.083
Listen to me.

1:14:29.167 --> 1:14:30.250
[wheezes]

1:14:30.333 --> 1:14:32.917
Don't let Cal hurt Travis.

1:14:35.167 --> 1:14:36.292
Don't leave him.

1:14:37.250 --> 1:14:38.542
Just stay with him.

1:14:39.417 --> 1:14:42.542
Or else we're gonna keep making
the same mistakes forever.

1:14:42.625 --> 1:14:43.708
[Becky] <i>Hello? Who is this?</i>

1:14:43.792 --> 1:14:45.667

<i>-Hello? What's going on?</i>

1:14:50.625 --> 1:14:52.458

[grunts and screams]

1:16:18.208 --> 1:16:20.250
[indistinct chanting]

1:16:26.750 --> 1:16:28.750
[Becky screaming]

1:16:56.583 --> 1:16:58.292
Baby... Baby...

1:16:59.125 --> 1:17:00.125
Little baby...

1:17:01.125 --> 1:17:02.375
[pants] Baby...

1:17:02.958 --> 1:17:04.167
-It's okay.
-Baby...

1:17:04.250 --> 1:17:05.750
Here, here, here, here.

1:17:07.250 --> 1:17:09.250
[panting]

1:17:09.333 --> 1:17:10.958
-No, not too fast.
-[gulps]

1:17:11.042 --> 1:17:12.292
I don't want you to get sick.

1:17:14.417 --> 1:17:16.333
-May I have a look? My baby?
-It's okay.

1:17:16.417 --> 1:17:18.292
-I've got her. I've got her.
-Baby...

1:17:19.083 --> 1:17:20.167
She's right here.

1:17:22.500 --> 1:17:23.500
I've got her.

1:17:24.500 --> 1:17:25.625
Isn't she great?

1:17:27.750 --> 1:17:30.208
Out of the oven and baked just right.

1:17:31.625 --> 1:17:33.042
Aren't you the Mother Mary?

1:17:33.833 --> 1:17:36.667
Wonder when the Wise Men will come.

1:17:38.792 --> 1:17:40.792
I wonder what gifts they'll have for us.

1:17:42.917 --> 1:17:43.875
Hmm...

1:17:56.375 --> 1:17:59.750
[Cal] There once was a farmer from Leeds

1:18:00.042 --> 1:18:03.542
Who swallowed a bag full of seeds

1:18:05.500 --> 1:18:08.750
-Big bunches of grass...
-Mm.

1:18:09.458 --> 1:18:11.417
-...sprouted out of his ass...
-[swallowing]

1:18:11.875 --> 1:18:14.292
And his balls...

1:18:15.292 --> 1:18:17.417
-grew all shaggy with weeds
-Mm.

1:18:18.500 --> 1:18:20.208
Mm. Mm.

1:18:21.417 --> 1:18:23.125
[swallows] Mm...

1:18:24.917 --> 1:18:26.875
Cal... [chews]

1:18:28.417 --> 1:18:29.375
What is that?

1:18:31.250 --> 1:18:32.208
What am I eating?

1:18:32.292 --> 1:18:33.333
Grass.

1:18:33.917 --> 1:18:35.208
It's just grass.

1:18:35.792 --> 1:18:36.792
[laughs]

1:18:37.292 --> 1:18:39.583
And seeds and so on.

1:18:39.958 --> 1:18:41.042
-Mm.
-[chuckles]

1:18:43.292 --> 1:18:45.042
Cows do it all the time.

1:18:50.708 --> 1:18:52.292
[munching]

1:18:53.958 --> 1:18:55.042
[Cal] Here's another piece.

1:18:55.125 --> 1:18:55.958
Mm.

1:18:56.042 --> 1:18:57.333
-It's good for you.
-Mm.

1:18:58.167 --> 1:18:59.542
It's good for your soul.

1:19:01.542 --> 1:19:03.125
[panting]

1:19:04.750 --> 1:19:05.625
Mm.

1:19:06.917 --> 1:19:07.792
Mm.

1:19:07.875 --> 1:19:09.542
-[Cal] Yeah.
-Mm. [swallows]

1:19:09.625 --> 1:19:10.667
[Cal chuckles]

1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:11.875
You ate it all.

1:19:12.542 --> 1:19:13.417
Yeah.

1:19:14.792 --> 1:19:15.958
That's a good girl.

1:19:16.500 --> 1:19:17.417
It tastes like...

1:19:19.750 --> 1:19:20.708
[Cal] Like what?

1:19:22.292 --> 1:19:23.250
[gags]

1:19:24.042 --> 1:19:24.875
Like...

1:19:26.250 --> 1:19:27.125
Like...

1:19:27.625 --> 1:19:28.833
[gasps]

1:19:29.500 --> 1:19:30.333
You?

1:19:39.792 --> 1:19:40.667
[Travis] Becky?

1:19:41.417 --> 1:19:42.750
[grunting]

1:19:44.042 --> 1:19:45.000
Becky!

1:19:45.083 --> 1:19:46.542
[grunting]

1:19:51.417 --> 1:19:53.167
[panting]

1:20:00.167 --> 1:20:01.000
Becky?

1:20:01.667 --> 1:20:02.708
[pants]

1:20:14.750 --> 1:20:15.583
Baby.

1:20:18.167 --> 1:20:19.000
Baby.

1:20:23.625 --> 1:20:24.583
[gasps]

1:20:27.417 --> 1:20:28.625
Oh, no.

1:20:32.417 --> 1:20:33.333
Oh.

1:20:35.042 --> 1:20:35.917
[sobs]

1:20:38.833 --> 1:20:40.083
Oh, please.

1:20:42.667 --> 1:20:43.958
Please, no.

1:20:44.375 --> 1:20:46.042
[Tobin] My daddy killed the baby.

1:20:48.125 --> 1:20:49.292
I know he did.

1:20:52.375 --> 1:20:53.583
I found Cal.

1:20:55.500 --> 1:20:56.750
He killed him, too.

1:20:58.667 --> 1:21:00.542
This is never gonna stop.

1:21:01.417 --> 1:21:03.667
He's gonna keep killing us over...

1:21:04.208 --> 1:21:05.250
and over...

1:21:05.708 --> 1:21:07.042
and over again.

1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:11.125
And it's never gonna stop.

1:21:11.875 --> 1:21:13.125
[sniffles]

1:21:16.750 --> 1:21:19.375
I'm not gonna let him hurt you.

1:21:21.833 --> 1:21:24.000
But he's watching us right now.

1:21:34.417 --> 1:21:35.667
You out there, Ross?

1:21:38.792 --> 1:21:39.917
Why hide?

1:21:40.750 --> 1:21:41.667
Huh?

1:21:43.083 --> 1:21:44.583
If you wanna finish us,

1:21:45.000 --> 1:21:46.792
then just do it already!

1:21:50.083 --> 1:21:51.083
I'm here!

1:21:52.167 --> 1:21:53.042
You see?

1:21:53.750 --> 1:21:54.750
I'm waiting!

1:21:54.833 --> 1:21:56.500
-[Tobin] Travis!
-[grunts]

1:21:57.208 --> 1:21:58.333
No.

1:21:58.417 --> 1:21:59.250
I don't see.

1:21:59.667 --> 1:22:00.833
Your honey took my eye out.

1:22:01.125 --> 1:22:01.958
[groans]

1:22:02.833 --> 1:22:03.792
But you know what?

1:22:04.417 --> 1:22:06.042
Eyes are deceiving around here.

1:22:06.417 --> 1:22:07.750
I'm better off without it.

1:22:08.958 --> 1:22:10.042
[yells]

1:22:10.833 --> 1:22:11.667
Dad!

1:22:14.292 --> 1:22:15.208
[gasps]

1:22:15.292 --> 1:22:17.375
Too bad, kid. I liked ya.

1:22:17.458 --> 1:22:18.958
Saw a seed of myself in there.

1:22:21.917 --> 1:22:23.083
[Tobin] Dad, no!

1:22:24.250 --> 1:22:25.750
[grunts]

1:22:33.958 --> 1:22:35.333
No, Dad. No!

1:22:39.750 --> 1:22:40.958
All I wanted...

1:22:41.500 --> 1:22:43.250
was to help you find redemption.

1:22:43.333 --> 1:22:44.375
[grunts]

1:22:44.458 --> 1:22:46.042
[groaning]

1:22:46.125 --> 1:22:47.375
-[Tobin] Stop!
-[groans]

1:22:47.458 --> 1:22:50.167
God knows you're the one
who needed it the most.

1:22:51.875 --> 1:22:53.083
Maybe next time.

1:22:53.792 --> 1:22:55.042
[groans]

1:22:58.500 --> 1:22:59.875
Travis!

1:23:01.750 --> 1:23:02.875
Ready for yours?

1:23:06.125 --> 1:23:07.000
[grunts]

1:23:07.083 --> 1:23:08.208
No!

1:23:08.292 --> 1:23:10.208
[panting]

1:23:10.292 --> 1:23:11.417
Gorgeous, isn't she?

1:23:13.250 --> 1:23:15.000
-No!
-It wants you to touch it.

1:23:16.083 --> 1:23:17.375
This field needs it.

1:23:19.250 --> 1:23:20.208
More than the rain.

1:23:21.375 --> 1:23:22.667
It's so easy, son.

1:23:22.750 --> 1:23:25.958
-Redemption is so very, very easy.
-[groans]

1:23:27.042 --> 1:23:28.292

1:23:54.750 --> 1:23:56.208
[grunting]

1:24:12.542 --> 1:24:14.625
[Travis] I'm not coming back here!

1:24:15.208 --> 1:24:16.042
[grunts]

1:24:17.292 --> 1:24:18.708
And neither are you!

1:24:25.583 --> 1:24:26.625
[grunts]

1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:31.542
[Ross choking]

1:24:35.625 --> 1:24:37.000
[Ross groaning]

1:24:39.792 --> 1:24:41.792
[Ross screaming]

1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:56.708
[chanting continues]

1:24:57.708 --> 1:24:59.708
[grunting and screaming continue]

1:25:01.375 --> 1:25:03.875
[chanting intensifies]

1:25:11.500 --> 1:25:12.917
[Travis grunts]

1:25:15.667 --> 1:25:17.750

1:26:04.333 --> 1:26:06.333
[indistinct whispering]

1:26:25.583 --> 1:26:26.958
Travis, don't.

1:26:28.708 --> 1:26:30.500
Don't. No. No. No!

1:26:31.458 --> 1:26:32.542
No!

1:26:32.625 --> 1:26:33.708
If you touch it...

1:26:34.750 --> 1:26:36.167
you'll never leave.

1:27:21.875 --> 1:27:23.583
[breathing heavily]

1:27:34.375 --> 1:27:35.292
Travis?

1:27:43.167 --> 1:27:44.208
Follow me.

1:27:44.292 --> 1:27:45.792
[Tobin panting]

1:28:05.583 --> 1:28:06.875
[grunts]

1:28:14.292 --> 1:28:15.458
I'm not leaving.

1:28:19.750 --> 1:28:20.667
But you...

1:28:23.750 --> 1:28:25.292
you don't belong here.

1:28:26.292 --> 1:28:27.500
And neither does Becky.

1:28:31.333 --> 1:28:32.542
Don't let them in.

1:28:37.875 --> 1:28:39.000
<i>Don't let them in, Tobin.</i>

1:29:00.625 --> 1:29:02.625

1:29:20.500 --> 1:29:22.500

1:29:55.750 --> 1:29:57.083
[Tobin] Help!

1:29:57.875 --> 1:29:58.708
[Becky] Hello?

1:29:59.583 --> 1:30:00.875
Is someone out there?

1:30:00.958 --> 1:30:02.625
[Tobin] Help!

1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:04.375
I'm lost in here.

1:30:05.208 --> 1:30:06.750
Sounds like he's really in trouble.

1:30:06.833 --> 1:30:08.708
I've been trying to get to the road,

1:30:08.792 --> 1:30:10.417
-but I can't find it!
-[sighs]

1:30:12.292 --> 1:30:13.125
Okay.

1:30:13.833 --> 1:30:14.875
We better haul him out.

1:30:15.208 --> 1:30:17.083
No! Don't go in there!

1:30:19.500 --> 1:30:21.125
Wait! No!

1:30:22.625 --> 1:30:23.708
Don't go in there!

1:30:23.792 --> 1:30:25.667
Stay away from it. Stay away.

1:30:25.750 --> 1:30:27.042
Are you okay?

1:30:27.125 --> 1:30:28.083
[Tobin] Help!

1:30:28.167 --> 1:30:29.125
Wasn't he just...

1:30:29.458 --> 1:30:30.708
Didn't we hear him...

1:30:31.208 --> 1:30:32.958
[Tobin] Help!

1:30:34.417 --> 1:30:35.667
Don't listen to him.

1:30:36.042 --> 1:30:37.583
Get back in the car. You have to go.

1:30:37.667 --> 1:30:39.833
-Kid, where are your parents?
-It doesn't matter. Please.

1:30:39.917 --> 1:30:41.958
-We just have to go. Get in the car.
-Okay.

1:30:42.042 --> 1:30:44.375
-[Tobin] I can't find my way out!
-What do we do?

1:30:44.458 --> 1:30:46.292
I mean,
it sure sounds like he's in trouble.

1:30:46.375 --> 1:30:48.542
No. No! No, don't let him go in!

1:30:48.625 --> 1:30:52.083
If he goes in, you'll go in
and you'll never get out.

1:30:52.167 --> 1:30:53.458
-Please!
-Okay...

1:30:55.333 --> 1:30:56.167
Please.

1:30:58.167 --> 1:30:59.542
[Tobin] Are you coming?

1:31:01.292 --> 1:31:02.542
Help me!

1:31:02.625 --> 1:31:04.792
-Where did you get this?
-Travis.

1:31:07.958 --> 1:31:09.292
Cal, wait!

1:31:10.375 --> 1:31:11.667
Get back here right now.

1:31:12.750 --> 1:31:14.167
[Tobin] Hey! Don't leave!

1:31:14.250 --> 1:31:15.292
Look.

1:31:17.542 --> 1:31:19.667
He said he got this from Travis.

1:31:19.750 --> 1:31:20.792
Travis?

1:31:20.875 --> 1:31:22.458
I'll explain later, I promise.

1:31:22.542 --> 1:31:24.667
But right now, we have to go. Please.

1:31:25.208 --> 1:31:26.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:31:26.583 --> 1:31:27.583
-Hey.
-[groans]

1:31:27.667 --> 1:31:28.500
Are you okay?

1:31:28.583 --> 1:31:30.208
[groans] We have to go.

1:31:31.167 --> 1:31:32.208
What about the kid?

1:31:32.292 --> 1:31:33.417
[Tobin] Can you hear me?

1:31:36.458 --> 1:31:38.125
Where are you?

1:31:38.208 --> 1:31:40.458
You've gotta help me get out of here!

1:31:41.458 --> 1:31:43.125
Something's not right about this.
