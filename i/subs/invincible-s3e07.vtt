11:59.052 --> 12:00.971
[Donald] There is some good news, sir.

12:01.054 --> 12:04.266
This Invincible definitely wasn't
as strong as ours.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.560
Then maybe we have a chance.

12:08.145 --> 12:10.147
Then again...

12:11.356 --> 12:13.108
Start the boys making more
of those noisemakers

12:13.191 --> 12:16.027
and get the room back up and running.
We need to respond.

12:16.111 --> 12:19.030
Sir... the engineering wing is gone.

12:19.114 --> 12:22.117
And how exactly do we respond to this?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.119
We make calls.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.579
[Donald] To who?

12:26.580 --> 12:28.415
Everyone, Donald.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.459
Everyone.

12:45.015 --> 12:48.226
It's one way, and we can't bring you back,

12:48.310 --> 12:51.313
so you're on your own
until the calvary arrives.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.316
Be strong, be brave.

12:56.109 --> 12:59.946
And let us know if you die
so we can send someone else.

13:00.030 --> 13:02.073
Go! Go! Go!

13:17.839 --> 13:20.342
Mar-- Uh, Invincible!

13:20.425 --> 13:21.760
Wait!

13:25.180 --> 13:28.475
Oh. And who do we have here?

13:32.437 --> 13:34.940
[Eve] This is really bad, Mark.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.234
They're everywhere.

13:37.317 --> 13:38.610
Jesus.

13:38.693 --> 13:40.987
-What do we do?
-[car alarm wailing]

13:41.071 --> 13:42.280
They're all me.

13:42.364 --> 13:45.534
I think we have to take them down,
one by one.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.411
And then we have
to figure out who did this.

13:48.495 --> 13:51.373
There's only one person
who could have done this.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.208
And I already killed him.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.669

you're a fraction of my power!

I cannot exist outside of my tomb

14:47.971 --> 14:51.099
without a host!

14:51.182 --> 14:53.184
Your people cursed you for a reason.

14:53.268 --> 14:54.894
Maybe think about that.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.438
[Ka-Hor] Bah!

14:56.521 --> 15:00.066
Good riddance to you wretched females!

Yeah, enjoy eternity alone,

If you hadn't wasted so much time
protecting these losers, you probably

would have beaten me already.
