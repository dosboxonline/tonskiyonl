00:48.966 --> 00:51.677
[Bobby]<i>We're here for a reason.</i>

00:51.677 --> 00:54.972
<i>Put on this earth
for a higher purpose.</i>

00:54.972 --> 00:56.974
<i>I have to believe that.</i>

00:56.974 --> 00:59.351
<i>I have to believe
that there's a higher purpose</i>

00:59.351 --> 01:03.814
<i>for me being here on this
corner at this time of day.</i>

01:03.814 --> 01:06.984
<i>Looking at those
fucking doors again.</i>

01:06.984 --> 01:08.944
[James] <i>I'm worried
that you get too close.</i>

01:08.944 --> 01:11.446
<i>- Yeah, I'm getting close.</i>
- Too close to that world.

01:11.446 --> 01:14.867
You don't kill anybody. Don't
shoot him in the face, okay?

01:14.867 --> 01:16.493
Where's his fucking money?

01:16.493 --> 01:18.412
[screams]

01:18.412 --> 01:22.249
[Bobby] <i>But I'm early
and in no rush whatsoever</i>

01:22.249 --> 01:24.668
<i>to find
out what that purpose is.</i>

01:24.668 --> 01:27.129
<i>The why can wait, but the how,</i>

01:27.129 --> 01:31.091
<i>that's actually a pretty
good story.</i>

01:31.091 --> 01:32.968
You tell them
you're an architect.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.345
You can go with a doctor
or a lawyer if you want,

01:35.345 --> 01:37.973
but I'm telling you
the chicks can somehow sniff
those out right away.

01:37.973 --> 01:39.641
Why don't you just
tell them the truth?

01:39.641 --> 01:41.310
The second
you tell them you're a cop,

01:41.310 --> 01:43.687
you can see the hamster wheel
start turning.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.814
They go through every
bad thing they've done,

01:45.814 --> 01:47.608
Wondering how it can be used
against them.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.277
So you tell them
that you're an architect.

01:50.277 --> 01:53.155
It's a desk job.
Relatable, safe,

01:53.155 --> 01:55.616
but distinguished enough.
Not scare them off.

01:55.616 --> 02:00.329
And architects make money,
so that helps.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.247
What happens when they find out
you're lying?

02:02.247 --> 02:03.290
Never happens.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.708
[radio chatter]

02:04.708 --> 02:07.920
I got to say, you know...

02:07.920 --> 02:11.965
Sounds good and all but I mean
dating sounds like a nightmare.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.134
It is. You're a lucky man.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.595
Married to a great woman.

02:16.595 --> 02:19.473
Yeah...

02:19.473 --> 02:21.475
Trouble at home?

02:21.475 --> 02:23.810
Yeah.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.521
I don't want to talk about it.

02:25.521 --> 02:28.899
It's the job.
You need to find a balance.

02:30.817 --> 02:34.112
I used to buy her flowers,
you know, just because.

02:34.112 --> 02:36.865
And then it was only on
special occasions, right?

02:36.865 --> 02:38.909
But those became
too few to count,

02:38.909 --> 02:40.369
and then it was only
when I fucked up,

02:40.369 --> 02:44.581
and, you know,
I fucked up a lot.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.917
So eventually, you know,

02:46.917 --> 02:49.628
flowers didn't mean
anything anymore,

02:49.628 --> 02:52.297
so I stopped.

02:52.297 --> 02:54.842
Sounds like you do
want to talk about it.

02:54.842 --> 02:58.679
Bobby, go back
home to your wife,

02:58.679 --> 03:01.723
get her some flowers
and get that balance back.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.695
Hey.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.779
Bobby.

03:15.779 --> 03:17.489
Shut your mouth.

03:17.489 --> 03:20.284
Hey, don't you talk
to her like that.

03:23.287 --> 03:24.997
Why don't you shut
your mouth too?

03:27.416 --> 03:29.585
I got you flowers.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.214
Maybe you should
just leave, man.

03:34.214 --> 03:39.928
[Bobby] <i>I should have taken
his advice. But instead...</i>

03:39.928 --> 03:41.638
Bobby, stop!

03:41.638 --> 03:43.682
[Bobby] <i>I decided to
redecorate my kitchen.</i>

03:43.682 --> 03:47.269
Stop! Stop.

03:47.269 --> 03:50.189
Stop! Bobby, please, stop!

04:21.094 --> 04:23.722
[Bobby] <i>There's a moment
right before you're fully awake</i>

04:23.722 --> 04:27.476
<i>where there's
a slight chance that you
could still be dreaming.</i>

04:27.476 --> 04:31.980

when you realize you're not.</i>

04:33.941 --> 04:36.735
<i>I've been married
for almost ten years</i>

04:36.735 --> 04:39.738

04:39.738 --> 04:41.406
Well, how do you know that

04:41.406 --> 04:44.535
he doesn't have
a license for that?

04:44.535 --> 04:47.246
No, no, that's
because you think that.

04:47.246 --> 04:50.749
You think that. See, you
can't make assumptions.

04:50.749 --> 04:53.210
Yeah. Yeah.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.796
Hey, there's a fresh pot
over there if you're interested.

04:55.796 --> 04:59.258
I got to call you back.
Okay. Bye bye.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.971
You're going
to be here for a while,

05:03.971 --> 05:05.138
you should make the most of it.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.516
Oh, yeah? How do I do that?

05:07.516 --> 05:09.268
Start typing. See what happens.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.228
Tell you exactly
what's going to happen.

05:11.228 --> 05:14.106
I'm going to make one typo
and this typewriter

05:14.106 --> 05:16.108
is going straight
out the goddamn window.

05:16.108 --> 05:19.236
Maybe. Maybe. You'll like it.

05:19.236 --> 05:23.282
Who knows, maybe you're
the next Ernest Hemingway.

05:23.282 --> 05:26.243
[chuckles]

05:26.243 --> 05:29.246
Yeah, I'm going to get
a cup of coffee
and get that window open.

05:29.246 --> 05:31.290
That's a start.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.543
[Bobby]<i>They let me keep my badge,

05:39.464 --> 05:42.676
Hey, you got a minute?

05:42.676 --> 05:46.471
<i>I put the guy in the hospital.
And they put me behind a desk.</i>

05:48.849 --> 05:50.934

- [Rick] It's Rick.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.936
How are you doing, Pam?<i>-Good, Rick and you?</i>

05:52.936 --> 05:55.022
Yeah, I'm okay.<i>-What can I do for you?</i>

05:55.022 --> 05:56.481

05:56.481 --> 05:57.816
<i>Sure. Just hold a minute.</i>

05:57.816 --> 05:59.026
Okay. Thank you.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.903
You got till I get off hold.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.946
You need to give me
something more than paperwork

06:02.946 --> 06:05.824
to keep me busy. I mean, I'm
losing my mind behind that desk.

06:05.824 --> 06:09.286
I really feel for you,
what you're going through
with Mary.

06:09.286 --> 06:13.624
It breaks my heart.
But my hands are tied.

06:13.624 --> 06:16.710
You're lucky that they're
allowing you in this building.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.629
Lucky. Rick, you got
to do something.

06:18.629 --> 06:21.089
First of all, it's captain.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.674
It's not Rick.

06:22.674 --> 06:25.093
Second of all,
I did do something.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.386
And you know what?

06:26.386 --> 06:27.721
That's why you're standing

06:27.721 --> 06:29.181

06:29.181 --> 06:31.099

on an unemployment line.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.018
He was sleeping
with my wife, Rick.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.561
And what did you do?

06:34.561 --> 06:36.396
- You disfigured him?
- I broke his nose.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.441
Okay? Let's not get
too dramatic here.

06:39.441 --> 06:41.818
<i>- Captain Callahan?</i>
- Yes, Pam.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.946

a teensy bit longer?</i>

06:43.946 --> 06:48.033
Okay, sweetheart.
You have a teensy bit longer.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.786
Listen, I know. I just,

06:50.786 --> 06:53.664
sometimes I get
a bit of a hot head.

06:53.664 --> 06:56.291
Hot head?
You went fucking nuclear.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.876
You should have seen him, Rick.
I mean,

06:57.876 --> 07:00.170
You should have just
walked out of there

07:00.170 --> 07:03.090

you walk out of here now.

12:54.942 --> 12:59.279
<i>But it was enough
to get me off my ass.</i>

12:59.279 --> 13:02.491
<i>I felt like
I had a purpose again.</i>

13:02.491 --> 13:04.451
<i>All I had to do was prove it.</i>

13:04.451 --> 13:07.454
<i>How fucking hard could that be?</i>

13:08.872 --> 13:10.999
Go away. I'm busy.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.797
Do you know how knocking works?

13:16.797 --> 13:18.715
First you knock on the door.

13:18.715 --> 13:20.467
You wait for the other person
on the other side of the door

13:20.467 --> 13:23.929
to respond to you.
What did you do?

13:23.929 --> 13:26.598
- I got a lead.
- You got a what?

13:26.598 --> 13:28.809
I met this guy last night.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.853
- Good for you.
- I did some digging.

13:30.853 --> 13:35.941
And he's part
of Roy DeMeo's crew.

13:39.069 --> 13:42.406
Roy DeMeo. Do you even
have a fucking clue who he is?

13:42.406 --> 13:45.742
- I think I got something here.
- You know what you got?

13:45.742 --> 13:49.329
You got a ton of paperwork
on your desk. A mountain.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.790
And if you don't get
going processing that shit

13:51.790 --> 13:54.001
it's going to
become two mountains.

13:54.001 --> 13:56.003
I mean,
these are mobsters, Rick.

13:56.003 --> 13:59.214
We got stacks of files
on these guys.
Just gathering dust.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.216
Bobby, you know
what mobsters are?

14:01.216 --> 14:03.635
They're fucking animals.
You know what they do?

14:03.635 --> 14:05.637
They kill each other.
And you know what?

14:05.637 --> 14:07.264
They got my blessing.

14:07.264 --> 14:09.975
We can set something up here,
something big.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.477
I mean, I can go undercover.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.730
- Undercover?
- Yeah. Remember that Queens job?

14:14.730 --> 14:16.690
I was on that job
for three months.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.525
Nobody could have done that
better than me. You know that.

14:18.525 --> 14:20.777
You know what I got here?
You see this?

14:20.777 --> 14:23.780
This is paperwork telling me

14:23.780 --> 14:26.742
that this is the end
of the police department
as we know it.

14:26.742 --> 14:30.329
I got budget cuts.
I got layoffs,
I got financial problems.

14:30.329 --> 14:31.788
We were on thin ice.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.665
Get this out of
your fucking head.

14:33.665 --> 14:37.377
Bobby, I love you, but get
this out of your head, please.

14:45.427 --> 14:51.808
[Bobby] <i>If I ever needed proof
that I was a colossal asshole,
this was it.</i>

14:51.808 --> 14:55.187
<i>I was at my wit's end. I mean,
the bottom of the barrel.</i>

14:55.187 --> 14:57.022
<i>Especially when it came to her.</i>

15:20.879 --> 15:23.006
What are you doing here, Bobby?

15:24.550 --> 15:25.634
Can I see her?

15:28.136 --> 15:30.097
You really scared her.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.682
Did you know about it?

15:34.142 --> 15:38.438
You mean Bobby, what did
you think was gonna
happen? Come on.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.065
I mean, I don't know.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.275
I definitely didn't think
she was gonna

15:41.275 --> 15:42.776
go off and fuck another guy.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.028
Hey, listen to me. They didn't.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.324
She didn't.

15:49.324 --> 15:52.619
She needed someone,
and he was there, okay?
You weren't, Bobby.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.288
Can I just talk to her? Mary.

15:54.288 --> 15:56.164
Mary, can I just talk
to you for five minutes?

15:56.164 --> 15:58.834
Just five minutes, please.

15:58.834 --> 16:00.878
Come on.

16:02.212 --> 16:06.091
Come here. I'm right here.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.552
Hey.

16:08.552 --> 16:14.016
Wow, wow, you look, uh,
you look great.

16:16.059 --> 16:19.354
Listen, I want you
to know that, uh,

16:19.354 --> 16:22.566
I know how I get sometimes.

16:22.566 --> 16:25.360
And I'm working really hard
to not be that way.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.989
You know, the captain says
I'm getting a promotion.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.909
Just around the corner.
I mean, things are goin' up.

16:31.909 --> 16:35.287
I quit drinking.
I'm doing pushups every day.

16:35.287 --> 16:37.456
You know I want
to get better for you.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.751
I know, I know.

16:40.751 --> 16:42.461
Broken record, right?

16:42.461 --> 16:45.964
But this time
it's different, I swear, just...

16:45.964 --> 16:48.175
Bob...

16:48.175 --> 16:50.928
Just give me one
more chance. Mary,

16:50.928 --> 16:52.554
Bobby, I...

16:54.681 --> 16:58.227
I don't have anything more
to give you.

17:01.605 --> 17:04.942
- I can't do this.
- Hey, hey.
You can't do what, Mary?

17:04.942 --> 17:06.610
You can't do what?

17:06.610 --> 17:08.862
Just look me in the eyes.

17:08.862 --> 17:12.157
Look me in the eyes
and tell me that you don't
love me anymore, huh?

17:12.157 --> 17:14.159
Just tell me that you don't
love me anymore.

17:14.159 --> 17:18.539
Tell me that you're willing to
throw away the last ten years.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.165
And I'll leave.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.167
I'm just asking you for

17:22.167 --> 17:23.877
one more chance, Mary.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.796
Please.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.467
All right, all right. Go inside.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.219
Bobby, come on stop it.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.429
Just give her some time, okay, honey?

17:34.429 --> 17:36.849
- Yeah.
- Just some time.

17:36.849 --> 17:39.726
Yeah.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.729
<i>I needed to get busy and quick.</i>

17:42.729 --> 17:45.983
<i>If I wanted everyone's respect
back, especially Mary's,</i>

17:45.983 --> 17:49.069
<i>I was going to have to take it,
not wait for their permission.</i>

17:49.069 --> 17:51.113
<i>And if I was
going to do it at all,</i>

17:51.113 --> 17:53.615
<i>I would have to do it right.</i>

17:58.704 --> 18:01.415
<i>It's I had Chris's
routine down to T.</i>

18:01.415 --> 18:04.042
<i>I even knew his favorite brand
of cigarettes.</i>

18:08.714 --> 18:11.884
<i>It was now or fucking never.</i>

18:11.884 --> 18:14.678
<i>This was really
where the barracuda swam.</i>

18:14.678 --> 18:16.471
<i>It was time I went fishing.</i>

18:27.065 --> 18:29.067
[disco music playing]

18:39.036 --> 18:42.789
[indistinct chatter]

18:45.792 --> 18:49.713
[Bobby] <i>Joseph Guglielmo.
They called him Dracula.</i>

18:49.713 --> 18:51.548
<i>You don't get a nickname
like that for giving</i>

18:51.548 --> 18:53.300
<i>off warm, fuzzy vibes.</i>

18:53.300 --> 18:55.052
- Goddamn it, Joe!
- Now what?

18:55.052 --> 18:56.887
You gotta call the Armenian.

18:56.887 --> 18:58.722
The girls' toilet's
back up again.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.682
- Ah, jeez.
- I'm wearing sandals.

19:00.682 --> 19:02.476
You better tell him
to come quick so I could

19:02.476 --> 19:04.895
- drown him in that bowl.
- Okay, all right. All right.

19:04.895 --> 19:06.146
What'll it be?

19:06.146 --> 19:09.233
Um, just a bourbon.

<i>Gina stuck out like a daisy
among the weeds in there.</i>

19:12.694 --> 19:15.239

cousin or something</i>

<i>and completely crazy to be
working in a place like that.</i>

19:18.700 --> 19:21.495
[man] Hey, Gina, come here.
I want to talk to you.

19:21.495 --> 19:25.082
- Ugh, yeah?
- When we going out on that
dinner date you and me, huh?

19:25.082 --> 19:28.794
Um, last time I checked,
hell still hasn't frozen over.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.170
[man chuckles]

19:30.170 --> 19:32.506
<i>That orangutan was Luca Santi.</i>

19:32.506 --> 19:35.509
<i>The only thing bigger than
his mouth was his debt to Roy.</i>

19:35.509 --> 19:37.344
So what's a pretty girl
like you know about hell?

19:37.344 --> 19:39.555
Keep pushing your luck
and you'll find out.

19:39.555 --> 19:42.516
Holy shit.
That's that fucking guy,
you see that fucking guy.

19:42.516 --> 19:44.393
That's the guy I was
telling you about.

19:44.393 --> 19:47.521
- Loverboy over here.
- With the thing, the architect.

19:47.521 --> 19:48.605
Fuck you guys.

19:48.605 --> 19:50.148
Get lost.

Billy.

19:54.278 --> 19:56.738
- Bobby. Bobby.
- Bobby, right?

19:56.738 --> 19:58.156
The architect.

19:58.156 --> 20:01.285
Yeah, well, you know,
not anymore.

20:01.285 --> 20:02.995
Oh, you get shit-canned?

20:02.995 --> 20:05.247
Is that why're you here
drowning your sorrows?

20:05.247 --> 20:08.083
Uh, let's just say that,
you know,

20:08.083 --> 20:10.752
building shit houses
wasn't for me.

20:10.752 --> 20:13.547
You know what is for you.
Hey, Gina. Gina.

20:13.547 --> 20:16.008
Get this fucking guy
whatever he wants, all right?

20:16.008 --> 20:18.343
Want another?

20:18.343 --> 20:20.804
So, what are
you doing here, Bobby?

20:20.804 --> 20:26.226
Well, you know,
a bar is a bar, right?

20:26.226 --> 20:29.438
Bar is a bar, that's right.

20:29.438 --> 20:32.024
But what are you doing here?

20:32.024 --> 20:33.984
This is a lounge.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.238
What's the difference?

20:38.238 --> 20:41.116
[laughs]

20:41.116 --> 20:42.409
It's a good question.

20:42.409 --> 20:43.994
Gina. Joseph. Bobby.

20:43.994 --> 20:46.163
Bobby, Gina. Joseph.
Gina's the pretty one.

20:46.163 --> 20:49.374
- Hey, I'm pretty.
- Yeah, your mother's a liar.

20:49.374 --> 20:52.336
- Architect huh?
- Yeah.

20:52.336 --> 20:55.923
Nice. A lot of school for that?

20:55.923 --> 20:58.175
I'm more of the
learn by doing type.

20:58.175 --> 21:00.385
- I like that.
- Want another one?

21:00.385 --> 21:01.720
Oh, please.

21:01.720 --> 21:04.056
- Make it a double.
- Please.

21:04.056 --> 21:05.849
You sure you're
in the right place?

21:05.849 --> 21:08.310
He's in the right place.
Listen, later on tonight,

21:08.310 --> 21:10.145
my buddies got a place
right next door.

21:10.145 --> 21:11.688
Going to play cards.
You should come by.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.565
Yeah, cards. Okay.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.359
Get him the fuck
out of here. Cheers.

21:15.359 --> 21:17.402
[Joseph] You don't fucking
play cards anyway.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.571
- I should get going here.
- Nah, come on.

21:19.571 --> 21:21.573
What, you got
somewhere you got to be?

21:23.242 --> 21:24.743
Fuck it. All right.

21:24.743 --> 21:25.869
- Come on.
- Thanks for the drink.

21:29.831 --> 21:32.292
Ignore these guys. Hey, guys.

21:32.292 --> 21:35.087
Bobby, this is the guys.
This is the guy I was telling
you about, the architect.

21:35.087 --> 21:39.341
This is Louis. This is Gianni.
This is Freddie. Guys, Bobby.

21:39.341 --> 21:40.634
Hey, take a seat.

21:40.634 --> 21:43.804
How you doing, Bobby?

21:43.804 --> 21:47.266
[Bobby] <i>Freddie DiNome.
Freddie was a pro
race car driver</i>

21:47.266 --> 21:49.893
<i>who was probably born
with a wrench in his hand.</i>

21:49.893 --> 21:52.062
<i>He ran a body shop
and was pretty much</i>

21:52.062 --> 21:54.314
<i>the head of the crew's
auto theft ring.</i>

21:54.314 --> 21:57.025
<i>He also stood so close to
your face when he talked</i>

21:57.025 --> 21:58.735
<i>to you that you could
have guessed what he had</i>

21:58.735 --> 22:00.362
<i>had for lunch that day.</i>

22:00.362 --> 22:02.531
Chris says you got his back
the other night.

22:05.409 --> 22:09.663
[Bobby] <i>On account of how bad
his breath was,
my guess was always shit.</i>

22:09.663 --> 22:11.540
I'm telling you, you should
have seen this guy's face

22:11.540 --> 22:12.833
after Bobby was done with him.

22:12.833 --> 22:15.169
looked like fucking mincemeat.

22:15.169 --> 22:16.712
Did he kill him?

22:16.712 --> 22:19.464
[Bobby]<i>Louis Russo and Gianni Russo.</i>

22:19.464 --> 22:21.008
<i>The Gemini brothers.</i>

<i>Roy DeMeo was the devil.</i>

22:23.093 --> 22:25.596
<i>Louie and Gianni
were his top demons.</i>

22:25.596 --> 22:27.890
<i>They were good thieves
and good killers.</i>

22:27.890 --> 22:29.266
<i>Perfect soldiers.</i>

22:29.266 --> 22:30.851
No, no, I didn't kill him.

22:30.851 --> 22:32.936
I mean, he was still
breathing when I left.

22:32.936 --> 22:34.521
- Barely
- Ah, barely.

22:34.521 --> 22:36.273
I didn't mean to hurt him
so fucking bad.

22:36.273 --> 22:38.358
But how bad did
you mean to hurt him?

22:38.358 --> 22:40.402
You know, just enough so that
he couldn't remember

22:40.402 --> 22:43.071
his own fucking name for
a couple of weeks. I don't know.

22:43.071 --> 22:44.656
[laughter]

22:44.656 --> 22:46.617
- Tough guy.
- We got a Marciano over here.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.203
Marciano over here.

22:49.203 --> 22:50.871
This guy hasn't stopped
talking about you.

22:50.871 --> 22:52.456
Non-fucking-stop he's been
going on about you.

22:52.456 --> 22:54.499
Listen, listen, we can
always use an extra

22:54.499 --> 22:56.502
pair of hands around here.

22:56.502 --> 22:58.837
What you think of
a career change, kid?

22:58.837 --> 23:00.631
Fuck.

23:00.631 --> 23:02.591
[Bobby] <i>You know, I had to
hold back a bit.</i>

23:02.591 --> 23:03.842
Nah...

23:03.842 --> 23:05.844
<i>Not seem too eager.</i>

23:05.844 --> 23:08.388
You guys are fucking
all right and all,
I mean you know...

23:08.388 --> 23:10.724
Bobby, we're cool
enough for you.

23:12.226 --> 23:13.894
[man] Chris, we're all right.

23:13.894 --> 23:17.814
We're talking about
working in the shade, right?

23:17.814 --> 23:20.067
- The fucking shade?
- What is this, Motown?

23:20.067 --> 23:21.777
What the fuck you talkin' about?

23:21.777 --> 23:23.779
[chatter]

23:23.779 --> 23:27.449
Fucking tell you, definitely
pushing a lot more than pencils,

23:27.449 --> 23:28.742
that's for sure.

23:28.742 --> 23:30.577

23:30.577 --> 23:32.371
What would I be doing?

23:32.371 --> 23:35.415
Whatever the fuck it takes.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.042

[Bobby] <i>We keep it out of
the books. Off the record.</i>

23:53.267 --> 23:56.144
James can wipe my files,
set me up with a new identity.

23:56.144 --> 23:57.563
If I get one whiff,

23:57.563 --> 23:58.981
that the whole thing's
going south.

23:58.981 --> 24:00.732
I bail, okay? You have my word.

24:00.732 --> 24:01.942
And no one's the wiser.

24:01.942 --> 24:04.695
The answer is still no.

24:04.695 --> 24:06.697
Do you know what
the fuck you're dealing with?

24:06.697 --> 24:08.699
Listen, I've been looking
into a few things and I'm

24:08.699 --> 24:10.492
telling you, this could be huge.

24:10.492 --> 24:13.078
You know what? This might be
a goddamn game to you.

24:13.078 --> 24:14.580
Maybe you're trying
to impress Mary

24:14.580 --> 24:16.290
and get killed
by these scumbags,

24:16.290 --> 24:18.125
but it ain't
going to impress me, okay?

24:21.170 --> 24:23.463
I'm a better man than I've
shown in the past few weeks.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.506
Okay?

24:27.009 --> 24:28.969
Let me prove it.

24:28.969 --> 24:30.596
[Rick sighs]

24:38.979 --> 24:41.315
All right? Let me see
what you got. All right.

24:41.315 --> 24:46.570
Yeah, I mean, I pulled
files on all these guys.

24:46.570 --> 24:48.655
They're all just sitting there.

24:48.655 --> 24:53.577
And I got ins with them.
I got my fucking hooks in.
You know?

24:53.577 --> 24:55.996
You know who you're
dealing with, right?

24:55.996 --> 24:58.290
I'm gonna come
on board with you.

24:58.290 --> 25:01.293
You make sure you tell me every
fucking thing that goes on.

25:01.293 --> 25:02.961
I won't let you down, Rick.

25:02.961 --> 25:05.589
Captain, you have my word.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.010
[Rick]
He has to disappear completely.

25:10.010 --> 25:12.054
All his fucking files. Everything.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.975
That's not going
to be easy, Captain.

25:16.975 --> 25:19.061
I can't just snap my fingers.

25:19.061 --> 25:21.188
Jimmy, do it.

25:21.188 --> 25:22.981
[Jimmy] You're lucky these guys
aren't from a different borough.

25:22.981 --> 25:24.608
Otherwise my hands
would be tied.

25:24.608 --> 25:26.610
Nobody's to know what
the hell we're doing.

25:26.610 --> 25:29.738
You know it,
he knows it. I know it,
one other person.

25:29.738 --> 25:31.323
The Chief of Internal Affairs.

25:31.323 --> 25:33.450
That's just in case we fuck up

25:33.450 --> 25:35.327
and step on
our cocks, you understand?

25:35.327 --> 25:38.330
All I'm saying is these guys
don't fuck around.

25:38.330 --> 25:41.875
I don't fuck around.
And his fucking balls
are on the line.

25:41.875 --> 25:45.671
You ready, son?

25:45.671 --> 25:49.800
By the way, you're going
to be ridin' shotgun.
Protect his ass.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.134
What?

25:51.134 --> 25:53.011
We're gonna be roommates.

25:54.596 --> 25:56.723
[sirens]

25:56.723 --> 25:59.393
- [baby crying]
- [argument through walls]

26:03.730 --> 26:05.691
[Jimmy] Cozy.

26:05.691 --> 26:07.943
[Bobby]
Yeah, you can have the bedroom.

26:07.943 --> 26:10.696
How generous.

26:10.696 --> 26:13.699
Well, let's get to work.

26:13.699 --> 26:16.577
<i>James was thorough.
I had to give him that.</i>

26:16.577 --> 26:20.372
Robert DeBono.

26:20.372 --> 26:24.168
You didn't tell 'em
your last name, did you?

26:24.168 --> 26:27.921
Hey, do you think that
I should leave this behind?

26:27.921 --> 26:31.884
You know, just in case those
fuckers try and frisk me?

26:31.884 --> 26:34.386
You think they checked
you out already?

26:34.386 --> 26:36.638
I didn't put in an application,
James, but, yeah,

26:36.638 --> 26:37.806
I'm pretty
sure I'm in the clear.

26:37.806 --> 26:40.142
You're pretty sure? Heh.

26:40.142 --> 26:42.436
You're pretty sure?

26:44.313 --> 26:46.356
Did anybody ever
mention the Gemini Method?

26:54.781 --> 26:57.701
See all those guys
in those photos?

26:57.701 --> 27:00.245
They went into that apartment
at the back of the club.

27:00.245 --> 27:01.788
They never came out.

27:05.542 --> 27:09.838
A method. The Gemini Method.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.757
It all happens
in that apartment.

27:17.513 --> 27:20.557
<i>It was clear where
Roy DeMeo fit in all this.</i>

27:20.557 --> 27:22.851
<i>But if I was going to get
to him, I had to impress</i>

27:22.851 --> 27:24.853
<i>his flunkies first.</i>

27:24.853 --> 27:28.941
<i>And if I did get to him,
we needed to get him on tape.</i>

27:38.325 --> 27:40.744
I'm going to
get fucking electrocuted.

27:40.744 --> 27:44.164
So, listen, do me a favor.
Don't get it wet.

27:44.164 --> 27:46.708
Don't go in the fucking rain.
What do you want from me?

27:46.708 --> 27:49.628
What I need you to do is
get this guy, Roy DeMeo.

27:49.628 --> 27:53.215
I want him on tape,
giving an order.

27:53.215 --> 27:55.759
If we get that done,
we can get the fuck out

27:55.759 --> 27:57.594
of here and have
a friggin' party.

27:57.594 --> 27:59.596
Cap? Cap, if you want me
to take good pictures,

27:59.596 --> 28:01.932
- I'm going to need more cars.
- Cars?

28:01.932 --> 28:04.935
Yeah to alternate.
I need at least four cars.

28:04.935 --> 28:07.855
Jimmy. You want
a fucking helicopter, too?

28:07.855 --> 28:09.314
These guys are not stupid.

28:09.314 --> 28:10.858
They're going to notice
the same car

28:10.858 --> 28:12.734
on the fucking same
street every day.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.820
They're going to get curious.
They're going to come over,

28:14.820 --> 28:16.071
they're going to see a guy
with a fucking camera
in the car.

28:16.071 --> 28:17.739
I'll give you two fucking cars,

28:17.739 --> 28:19.783
and then I'm going to give you
a longer lens

28:19.783 --> 28:22.077
so could stay two fucking
blocks away. Okay?

28:22.077 --> 28:24.705
I got two cars.
That's what I got now.

28:24.705 --> 28:27.583
- [honking]
- Bobby! Let's go.

28:27.583 --> 28:31.795
All right. Hey, he's here,
he's here. Are you ready?

28:31.795 --> 28:33.589
Bobby, give me a second.
I'll be right there, all right?

28:33.589 --> 28:35.215
Okay. All right.

28:38.218 --> 28:40.345
What the fuck? Let's go!

28:42.181 --> 28:45.184
- Hey,
- Hey, what you going
to a wedding?

28:45.184 --> 28:47.352
I want to make
a good impression.

28:47.352 --> 28:49.438
Whatever. You drivin'. Come on.

28:49.438 --> 28:51.607
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

28:53.150 --> 28:54.610
All right.

29:04.828 --> 29:07.372
<i>DeMeo had no problem
selling this stuff,</i>

29:07.372 --> 29:09.708
<i>but he never wanted
to see his guys doing it.</i>

29:09.708 --> 29:13.253
- You want some?
- No, no, I'm good.

29:13.253 --> 29:15.964
<i>If it wasn't booze or tobacco,
he better not catch</i>

29:15.964 --> 29:18.175
<i>you putting it
anywhere near your lips.</i>

29:18.175 --> 29:20.302
<i>And especially not
up your nose.</i>

29:21.803 --> 29:24.306
[spits]

29:34.316 --> 29:37.945
<i>If there was one thing
wise guys really
got a kick out of,</i>

29:37.945 --> 29:40.239
<i>it was nicknames.</i>

29:41.907 --> 29:44.701
<i>Freddie was known
as Broadway Freddie,</i>

29:44.701 --> 29:47.287
<i>a relic from his
alleged racing days.</i>

29:47.287 --> 29:49.039
[Chris] Hey!

29:49.039 --> 29:50.958
[Freddie] Hey, boys. What up?

29:50.958 --> 29:52.835
A fucking grease monkey.
Look at his broad.

29:52.835 --> 29:54.461
- She's got a fat fucking ass.
- [whistles]

29:54.461 --> 29:56.088
You like it, kid?

29:56.088 --> 29:58.549
[Bobby] Oh, man.

29:58.549 --> 30:00.717
Very much.

30:00.717 --> 30:03.720
<i>- Te amo.</i>
- Too much. Too much.

30:03.720 --> 30:05.472
Hey, you know
anything about cars, kid?

30:05.472 --> 30:07.140
Aside from driving them,
not much.

30:07.140 --> 30:09.184
I mean, I know how
to change a flat tire.

30:09.184 --> 30:10.644
Freddie here's going
to teach you a lot more

30:10.644 --> 30:12.271
than how to change
a fucking flat.

30:12.271 --> 30:15.274
So I guess you never
boosted a car then, huh?

30:15.274 --> 30:17.901
- You guessed right.
- Yeah.

30:17.901 --> 30:20.195
Why don't you take this
screwdriver and follow me?

30:20.195 --> 30:21.446
All right.

30:26.493 --> 30:28.871
First things first,
jam it in the ignition

30:28.871 --> 30:30.998
and fucking smack
it like your old lady.

30:30.998 --> 30:32.207
[Chris] Hey.

30:35.836 --> 30:38.046
- [Bobby grunts]
- [Chris chuckles]

30:38.046 --> 30:39.965
All right, good.
Now start her up.

30:44.261 --> 30:46.388
He's got performance anxiety.

30:46.388 --> 30:48.765
Fuck.

30:48.765 --> 30:50.601
It's your first time.

30:50.601 --> 30:52.519
It happens, kid.

30:56.398 --> 30:57.900
This here is plan B.

31:00.402 --> 31:03.614
Cut those two wires in there.

31:03.614 --> 31:05.908
And fucking tie them together.
Yep. Those two.

31:05.908 --> 31:09.244
All right, good. Now cut those
two fucking wires. Those two.

31:09.244 --> 31:11.121
Don't fucking touch them.

31:11.121 --> 31:14.166
Good, now make them kiss.

31:17.961 --> 31:19.254
Yeah!

31:19.254 --> 31:21.006
All right, all right, all right.

31:21.006 --> 31:23.759
Fuckin' boy is a natural.
Look at that. Told you.

31:23.759 --> 31:25.844
[Bobby]<i>I hate to admit it, but,</i>

31:25.844 --> 31:29.932
<i>I kind of felt pretty
goddamn proud of myself.</i>

31:29.932 --> 31:33.352
<i>These guys would steal eight,
even ten cars a day.</i>

31:33.352 --> 31:35.187
<i>And no shit boxes, either.</i>

31:35.187 --> 31:38.482
<i>These had to be top
of the line vehicles.</i>

32:03.048 --> 32:04.800
<i>I always wanted a Corvette.</i>

32:07.553 --> 32:10.722
<i>It killed me to even put
a fucking scratch
on that thing.</i>

32:18.647 --> 32:20.732
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mick,
Mick, get over here!

32:20.732 --> 32:22.943
Fuckin' Bobby,
already gonna fuck up.

32:24.361 --> 32:27.656
Hey, get out of the car,
get outta the car.

32:27.656 --> 32:29.032
[Bobby] <i>This wasn't good.</i>

32:29.032 --> 32:30.450
<i>I felt like he just caught me</i>

32:30.450 --> 32:32.077
<i>with my dick in his wife.</i>

32:32.077 --> 32:34.079
This is Tony's car, right?

32:34.079 --> 32:35.539
Who the fuck is Tony?

32:35.539 --> 32:37.165
Should we go get him?

32:37.165 --> 32:39.376
Hold it. This guy,
he's got it, he's got it.

32:39.376 --> 32:41.170
Keep speaking, Tony.
What do you talk--

32:41.170 --> 32:43.463
Tony's the fucking guy
told me to take the--

32:43.463 --> 32:46.383
[chattering]

32:46.383 --> 32:49.386
Is he out of his fuckin' mind?

32:49.386 --> 32:53.265
You're a rat. Yeah you are.
You fuckin' rat!

32:53.265 --> 32:57.019
Come on you fuckin' pussies!
Huh, c'mon!

32:57.019 --> 32:59.605
- [man] Fuck you!
- [Bobby] Oh yeah, fuck me!

32:59.605 --> 33:01.732
Fuckin' say something motherfuckers,

33:01.732 --> 33:03.192
I'll fuck you up right now.

33:03.192 --> 33:04.985
<i>I hadn't felt that good</i>

33:04.985 --> 33:06.945
<i>since my team made
the finals in Little League.</i>

33:09.823 --> 33:12.284
[man] Now we're going to get
in fucking trouble
because of you.

33:12.284 --> 33:16.038
[Bobby] <i>And that's exactly
how this felt. Like a team.</i>

33:16.038 --> 33:18.790
You couldn't get a fucking
Lincoln or a Cadillac,
somethin' fuckin' nice?

33:18.790 --> 33:21.376
A fuckin' Lincoln?
Hey, this car's a beauty!

33:21.376 --> 33:24.505
Finally, someone with some
fucking taste around here.

33:24.505 --> 33:28.217
[man] Oooh, all right!

33:28.217 --> 33:30.177
That was the first of many.

33:30.177 --> 33:32.763
Roy's going to be real happy.
Believe that.

33:32.763 --> 33:35.432
[Bobby] <i>That was the first time
any of them mentioned Roy.</i>

33:35.432 --> 33:37.601
- Those Irish pricks make you?
- [Chris] Make them?

33:37.601 --> 33:39.019
They didn't know
what fucking hit 'em.

33:39.019 --> 33:40.604
Yeah, was it anybody we know?

33:40.604 --> 33:42.272
Fucking tourists. I don't know.

33:42.272 --> 33:44.358
It's DeBono, right?

33:44.358 --> 33:46.944
- What?
- Your name?

33:46.944 --> 33:49.821
- Oh, yeah.
- Bobby Bones.

33:49.821 --> 33:52.407
- Bobby Bones.
- I like it. Bobby Bones.

33:52.407 --> 33:55.118
- Bones.
- Bobby fucking Bones. I like it.

33:55.118 --> 33:57.204
[Bobby]<i>Mobsters and their nicknames.</i>

33:57.204 --> 33:58.622
- Here's to the Irish.
- [phone rings]

33:58.622 --> 34:01.416
Hello?

34:01.416 --> 34:03.585
I got it.

34:03.585 --> 34:06.672
Boys. Time to go.

34:06.672 --> 34:07.965
Now.

34:13.053 --> 34:14.721
Where they goin'?

34:14.721 --> 34:17.349
We're gonna go next door.

34:20.185 --> 34:21.979
[Bobby] <i>Next door to
the Gemini Lounge was</i>

34:21.979 --> 34:24.022
<i>an apartment where
the gang would get together.</i>

34:27.568 --> 34:28.986
<i>There he was.</i>

34:32.364 --> 34:33.615
<i>Roy DeMeo.</i>

34:35.409 --> 34:38.453
<i>The air got thicker
the closer I got to him.</i>

34:51.717 --> 34:52.718
Sit down.

34:57.389 --> 34:59.725
Heard you've been
doing a good job.

34:59.725 --> 35:00.934
He's been doing great.

35:04.146 --> 35:06.690
[Bobby] <i>I started to sweat
and suddenly was very</i>

35:06.690 --> 35:09.026
<i>aware of that goddamn wire.</i>

35:09.026 --> 35:11.278
You having a good time
with my guys?

35:11.278 --> 35:14.031
Oh, yeah. I mean,
great bunch of guys.

35:16.033 --> 35:19.203
You know, I was a butcher's
apprentice when I was a kid.

35:19.203 --> 35:21.455
He's the one who taught me

35:21.455 --> 35:24.041
between a good piece
of meat and a bad one.

35:25.709 --> 35:28.462
How to cut through
the joints, not the bones.

35:30.589 --> 35:33.509
You know, Muslims and Jews,
they don't eat pork.

35:33.509 --> 35:35.177
You knew that, right?

35:35.177 --> 35:37.930
They think it's a dirty animal

35:37.930 --> 35:39.932
because they roll around
in their shit.

35:39.932 --> 35:42.893
Even fuck in their shit,

35:42.893 --> 35:46.355
They're considered
the dirtiest of the dirty.

35:46.355 --> 35:49.024

36:07.543 --> 36:08.544
You know why?

36:13.549 --> 36:15.092

- You hungry?
- Yeah.

All right. We're gonna eat.
Chris, put this in the freezer.

almost a month after that,</i>

foundation for our case.</i>

36:57.509 --> 36:59.720
[Bobby]
That was a fucking crazy day.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.138
It's the life, I'm tellin' you.

37:01.138 --> 37:02.723
Roy's a fucking good guy, too.

37:02.723 --> 37:05.142
- I mean, he's cool.
- Yeah, he's something.

37:05.142 --> 37:07.060
Yeah.

37:07.060 --> 37:11.148
Here's for that first impression
you wanted, you did good.

37:11.148 --> 37:13.942
<i>That was more cash
than I made in a month.</i>

37:13.942 --> 37:16.486
All right,
I'll see you tomorrow.

37:16.486 --> 37:18.238
Sweet dreams, Bobby.

That was fucking crazy.

37:41.053 --> 37:42.763
What happened in that apartment?

37:49.895 --> 37:51.980
We're gonna need more film.

I figured, you know, I know
you like to shop on Mondays.

There's less crowds,
so I figured I'd drop by

I'm sorry.

a spade of spade, right?

There's a breeze in here.

because he can't talk.

Yeah.

you might have a problem.

46:18.362 --> 46:20.822
Yeah. Honestly,
I didn't mean to...

about him, something familiar.</i>

that specific question.

Just one.

What happened?

47:02.948 --> 47:05.450
He was trying to kill me.

47:05.450 --> 47:08.495
Why was he trying to kill you?

47:08.495 --> 47:10.581
He was disrespecting my sister.

47:10.581 --> 47:14.585
So I clocked him in front
of the other kids.

47:14.585 --> 47:20.007
He was a bigger kid
and he chased me onto the roof.

47:20.007 --> 47:25.304
And we were struggling, but,

47:25.304 --> 47:31.185
there's that moment, you know,
where you make a choice
and I just...

47:31.185 --> 47:33.478
threw him off the fucking roof.

47:35.898 --> 47:38.692
And they call it a suicide.

47:40.903 --> 47:43.071
I, uh,

47:43.071 --> 47:46.033
I never told that
to anybody before.

47:49.870 --> 47:52.664
So you did it...

47:52.664 --> 47:55.584
to honor your sister,
did she know
what you did for her?

47:55.584 --> 48:01.715
She didn't say much about it.
You know, she was, uh...
she was dead.

48:01.715 --> 48:07.471
She, uh, she killed herself
earlier that summer, so...

48:07.471 --> 48:09.765
Kid was just mouthing off
about my dead sister

48:09.765 --> 48:12.893
and I couldn't let it slide.

48:12.893 --> 48:14.353
How old were you?

48:15.854 --> 48:17.689
Sixteen.

48:17.689 --> 48:19.107
Stupid.

48:25.072 --> 48:26.281
What did it feel like?

48:30.285 --> 48:32.329
Didn't feel like anything.

48:33.914 --> 48:35.207
[phone rings]

48:40.420 --> 48:41.421
Hello?

48:43.048 --> 48:44.383
Okay.

48:49.304 --> 48:52.266
Come with me. Come on.

48:52.266 --> 48:53.976
[Bobby] <i>Something was up.</i>

48:53.976 --> 48:56.395
<i>For a second, I thought
Roy made me for sure.</i>

48:56.395 --> 48:57.646
[Roy] Come on.

49:00.274 --> 49:03.110
[Bobby] <i>He was eyeing me
like a hawk back there.</i>

49:03.110 --> 49:05.028
[chatter]

49:09.491 --> 49:12.619
Guys, come with me.
I'll call you later, Chris.

49:12.619 --> 49:15.038
- Yeah.
- Come on. Come on, come on.

49:15.038 --> 49:18.333
[Bobby] <i>Whatever was going down
was going down soon.</i>

49:18.333 --> 49:20.502
<i>And by the look
on Chris's face,</i>

49:20.502 --> 49:22.129
<i>it was going
to be something big.</i>

49:22.129 --> 49:24.047
- Ah.
- What's up?

49:24.047 --> 49:27.926
- We got to wait.
- For what?

49:27.926 --> 49:29.636
For the guys to get back.

49:31.763 --> 49:33.265
Come with me.

49:33.265 --> 49:34.766
I wanna pick your brain
about something.

49:37.352 --> 49:41.190
Hey, what's up?

49:41.190 --> 49:45.444
Ever since Roy got made,
things have been uh, different.

49:45.444 --> 49:47.696
You know, Paul treats him
like a prince on account of

49:47.696 --> 49:49.907
the Westies deal
with the rest of us...

49:49.907 --> 49:51.867
we're basically slinging shit.

49:51.867 --> 49:54.161
[Bobby] <i>Let me fill you in
on what he's talking about.</i>

49:54.161 --> 49:56.538
<i>DeMeo had a hard time
getting made.</i>

49:56.538 --> 50:00.250
<i>But when he helped
put the Irish mob,
also known as the Westies,</i>

50:00.250 --> 50:02.127
<i>in bed with the Gambinos,</i>

50:02.127 --> 50:03.754
<i>Paul Castellano
was tickled pink</i>

50:03.754 --> 50:05.923
<i>and decided it was time.</i>

50:05.923 --> 50:08.467
Now, sometimes we do things
we ain't supposed to do

50:08.467 --> 50:11.720
and Roy, God bless him,
he turns a blind eye.

50:11.720 --> 50:13.764
And sometimes you get
the chance to cut yourself

50:13.764 --> 50:17.142
a bigger piece of the pie.

50:17.142 --> 50:20.979
But this time, we're goin'
for a bigger fucking pie.

50:20.979 --> 50:23.190
Well, how much bigger?

50:24.399 --> 50:26.527
I got a guy down in Florida.

50:26.527 --> 50:27.903
And it stays between us, right?

50:27.903 --> 50:29.363
Yeah, of course.

50:32.741 --> 50:35.786
- Colombians.
- Colombians?

50:35.786 --> 50:37.496
They're bringing
some grade-A shit.

50:37.496 --> 50:39.331
Like actual fucking coke.

50:39.331 --> 50:41.083
Not the bullshit
that we're dealing.

50:41.083 --> 50:42.918
And you're not telling Roy?

50:42.918 --> 50:45.546
I'm not telling anybody.

50:45.546 --> 50:48.173
So what do you think?

50:48.173 --> 50:49.883
I mean, what's the problem?

50:52.094 --> 50:54.805
They're bringing a lot
of fucking powder, Bobby.

50:54.805 --> 50:58.225
More than I can move on my own
comfortably, I got to admit.

50:58.225 --> 51:00.185
So, I was thinkin',

51:00.185 --> 51:02.855
I'll bring you in.
We could share it.

51:05.065 --> 51:07.776
Man, ah...

51:07.776 --> 51:10.529
I mean, I don't know, Chris.
I mean...

51:10.529 --> 51:12.906
I don't know if I'm ready
for something like that.

51:16.159 --> 51:20.247
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, you're not ready,
you're not ready.

51:20.247 --> 51:22.624
It's all good.
What am I going to do, right?

51:24.877 --> 51:26.920
I thought you'd be
more excited about this.

51:26.920 --> 51:30.465
I thought you'd jump at it.
But I guess I was wrong.

51:30.465 --> 51:32.467
Mum better be the fucking word,
though, right?

51:32.467 --> 51:35.512
Mum's my favorite
fucking word. Come on.

51:35.512 --> 51:38.974
All right, good.

51:38.974 --> 51:41.518
Let's get out of here.

51:41.518 --> 51:43.520
[Bobby] <i>No fucking way.</i>

51:43.520 --> 51:45.314
<i>Chris could have made a deal
with the Russians,</i>

51:45.314 --> 51:48.108
<i>for all I cared.
I was after Roy.</i>

51:48.108 --> 51:50.235
All right, Roy.
I'll see you later.

51:55.115 --> 51:58.368
[Freddie] Bobby. Front seat.

51:58.368 --> 52:00.370
[Bobby] <i>One of the things
I learned quick was that</i>

52:00.370 --> 52:02.039
<i>sitting in the passenger seat</i>

52:02.039 --> 52:04.291
<i>with a maniac
in the backseat behind you</i>

52:04.291 --> 52:07.753
<i>was the worst possible position
to be in during a road trip.</i>

52:07.753 --> 52:10.088
[engine starts]

52:22.559 --> 52:24.436
<i>We were headed out of the city.</i>

52:24.436 --> 52:26.605
<i>James was going to have
to sit this one out,</i>

52:26.605 --> 52:29.858
<i>or we were going
to get made for sure.</i>

52:35.364 --> 52:38.742
No, I don't
know what's going on, but...

52:38.742 --> 52:40.160
I know.

52:44.873 --> 52:46.208
Come here.

52:49.837 --> 52:50.838
Open the trunk.

52:58.679 --> 53:00.430
Remember him?

53:00.430 --> 53:02.391
[Bobby] <i>It was the guy
I fucked up that night</i>

53:02.391 --> 53:04.351
<i>with Chris in the bathroom.</i>

53:04.351 --> 53:07.437
<i>If there was one thing
Roy would not tolerate,</i>

53:07.437 --> 53:09.773
<i>it was loose ends.</i>

53:09.773 --> 53:14.528
<i>Everything is so clear
when you look back at it.</i>

53:14.528 --> 53:17.030
<i>I should have killed them
all right then and there.</i>

53:17.030 --> 53:19.283
<i>But in situations like this,</i>

53:19.283 --> 53:23.412
<i>instead of doing
what you should do,</i>

53:23.412 --> 53:25.789
<i>you do what you have to do.</i>

53:30.377 --> 53:32.129
<i>I remembered that kid
on the roof.</i>

53:33.589 --> 53:35.924
<i>And I remembered my sister.</i>

53:37.217 --> 53:40.179
Freddy, close the trunk.
Let's go. Go.
Get back in the car.

53:40.179 --> 53:42.723
<i>And I felt nothing.</i>

53:42.723 --> 53:44.516
[Roy] Go, back in the car.

53:49.313 --> 53:50.314
Let's go.

54:06.288 --> 54:07.414
[Roy on tape] <i>Remember him?</i>

54:16.089 --> 54:18.133
[gunshots]

54:50.290 --> 54:51.792
Where'd they take you?

54:51.792 --> 54:55.045
Oh, man, I don't
want to talk about it.

54:55.045 --> 54:56.255
What's that supposed to mean?

54:56.255 --> 54:57.798
Nothing.

54:57.798 --> 55:00.634
Give me, give me the tape.

55:00.634 --> 55:01.927
Just let it go, okay?

55:01.927 --> 55:03.428
Where the fuck is the tape?

55:03.428 --> 55:05.180
Just let it go, okay?

55:05.180 --> 55:06.598
You want me to call
the captain and tell them that

55:06.598 --> 55:08.267
you think I should
just let it go?

55:08.267 --> 55:10.185
We are going to get
everything we need to put

55:10.185 --> 55:11.895
these guys away for the rest
of their fucking lives, okay?

55:11.895 --> 55:15.524
But right now, you just
need to trust me. Okay?

55:15.524 --> 55:18.527
Just let it go.

55:18.527 --> 55:22.155
All right? Let it go.

55:32.708 --> 55:38.046
<i>I couldn't face her anymore.
Not until it was all over.</i>

55:38.046 --> 55:40.591
<i>Even just sitting here might be
putting her in danger,</i>

55:40.591 --> 55:42.426
<i>but I had to see her again.</i>

55:42.426 --> 55:45.846
<i>Her smile was the only thing
keeping me going.</i>

55:45.846 --> 55:47.806
<i>I had to find a way back to it.</i>

56:07.701 --> 56:10.954
Hey. Mister Nice Guy.

56:10.954 --> 56:15.375
Yeah, hey, um, is Chris here?

56:15.375 --> 56:18.420
No, I haven't seen him
since yesterday.

56:21.882 --> 56:23.800
What's with the long face?

56:23.800 --> 56:25.677
It's, uh, it's nothin'

56:25.677 --> 56:27.846
I know a lie when I hear one.

56:29.515 --> 56:33.644
Well, girl trouble.

56:33.644 --> 56:37.272
I knew it. Always is.

56:37.272 --> 56:39.983
What, you think
it's that simple?

56:39.983 --> 56:42.236
Yeah. I could have his legs
blown off and still not feel

56:42.236 --> 56:44.196
as bad as when there's
girl trouble.

56:46.240 --> 56:49.368
I'll let you be
in my ear for a bit.

56:49.368 --> 56:51.870
Hey, Bobby. Let's go.

56:51.870 --> 56:53.205
We're going for a drive.

57:32.369 --> 57:35.038
[Bobby] <i>We were paying
Luca Santi visit.</i>

57:35.038 --> 57:37.583
<i>His debt was ballooning,
and the twins were ordered to</i>

57:37.583 --> 57:40.460
<i>give him what they called
a final warning.</i>

57:56.226 --> 58:00.230
Get the fuck down. Sit down.

58:00.230 --> 58:03.483
Guys, come on,
calm down, please.

58:03.483 --> 58:06.987
Listen, guys,
I had a good month.
A really good month.

58:06.987 --> 58:08.906
A couple more months like this
and I'll have this, all--

58:08.906 --> 58:10.240
Where's the fuckin' money?

58:12.868 --> 58:15.787
I'm good for it. Roy knows this.

58:15.787 --> 58:18.540
- Roy don't want your word.
- He wants his fucking money.

58:18.540 --> 58:20.918
I know. Just give me a chance.
Give me a chance.

58:20.918 --> 58:23.170
You could have three good months
and you're still going to be
fucking short.

58:23.170 --> 58:25.672
- You understand that?
- Come on guys, please.

58:25.672 --> 58:28.425
Put your hand on the book.

58:28.425 --> 58:30.636
- Put your hand on the book.
- Come on, guys.

58:30.636 --> 58:32.763
It doesn't have to be like this.
I'll take care of you.

58:32.763 --> 58:34.765
Your hand, put it on
the fuckin' book!

58:36.892 --> 58:40.395
Bobby, hold him down.
Bobby, get the fuck over there.

58:40.395 --> 58:43.232
- Hold him the fuck down.
- [Gianni] Come on.

58:43.232 --> 58:46.109
Guys, give me a chance to
make this right, please.

58:46.109 --> 58:51.615
Luca, it's your neck
or your fucking hand? Which one?
Hmm?

58:51.615 --> 58:53.784
Listen, you got to understand,
you can come into the bar,

58:53.784 --> 58:57.663
you can have a drink,
you can try to look up
Gina's skirt, okay?

58:57.663 --> 58:59.206
But if you don't pay Roy,

58:59.206 --> 59:01.375
I'm going to cut your
fucking tongue out

59:01.375 --> 59:04.002
and I'm going to feed it
to that hooker you call
your fucking wife.

59:04.002 --> 59:05.754
You understand?

59:05.754 --> 59:06.964
Yes.

59:06.964 --> 59:08.340
Good.

59:09.466 --> 59:11.969
[screaming]

59:25.858 --> 59:26.859
I'll see you next week, Luca.

59:31.780 --> 59:33.532
[Bobby]<i>Nothing was phasing me anymore.</i>

59:33.532 --> 59:36.743
<i>I mean, what was going on
in my fucking head?</i>

59:39.454 --> 59:41.790
The fuck you doing?

59:41.790 --> 59:44.543
You lost your fucking mind.

59:44.543 --> 59:46.420
Huh? Have you?

59:46.420 --> 59:48.172
If someone sees us,
we're fucking dead.

59:48.172 --> 59:50.382
Yeah, you know what? I'm taking
the fucking night off.

59:50.382 --> 59:53.343
Hey, Fuck.

01:00:14.239 --> 01:00:16.283
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:23.916
Ooh, you're finally letting
your hair down. I like it.

01:00:23.916 --> 01:00:27.252
- Roy in his office?
- No, it's his kid's
birthday today.

01:00:27.252 --> 01:00:31.507
Oh, well, happy birthday.

01:00:31.507 --> 01:00:33.425
What time do you get off?

01:00:33.425 --> 01:00:35.177
You tell me.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:50.859
[Bobby] <i>It wasn't
the best course of action, but...</i>

01:00:50.859 --> 01:00:53.153

My wife, she, uh, she left me.

01:01:58.427 --> 01:01:59.928
You got any kids?

01:01:59.928 --> 01:02:04.183
Nah, never got around to it.

01:02:04.183 --> 01:02:07.269
That's a good thing, right?

01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:11.231
Don't want any rugrats getting
mixed up in all that bullshit.

01:02:11.231 --> 01:02:12.733
Yeah.

01:02:14.359 --> 01:02:17.362
Hey, Roy has kids?

01:02:17.362 --> 01:02:19.114
Yeah, three of them.

01:02:19.114 --> 01:02:22.618
[chuckles] I just never took him
for a family man.

01:02:22.618 --> 01:02:27.706
Mm. A lot of people don't.
But...

01:02:27.706 --> 01:02:31.168
family is at the top
of Roy's priorities.

01:02:31.168 --> 01:02:32.961
You know who he is, right?

01:02:32.961 --> 01:02:34.588
I mean, you know what he does.

01:02:37.049 --> 01:02:38.091
Sure.

01:02:44.014 --> 01:02:45.265
And you're okay with it?

01:02:53.774 --> 01:02:55.108
I gotta close up.

01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:58.820
Thanks for the talk.

[Rick] Wow. Yeah.

01:03:22.636 --> 01:03:26.098
You've been real busy.
I see you guys are
really, really busy.

01:03:26.098 --> 01:03:28.183
Yes, sir.

01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:30.727
You know why I'm here
at two o'clock
in the fucking morning?

01:03:30.727 --> 01:03:34.731
You think I came over to here
to have fucking coffee with you?

01:03:34.731 --> 01:03:37.401
Let me tell you,
I got a call from Jim

01:03:37.401 --> 01:03:41.530
and Jim is very
concerned about you.

01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:43.031
I don't know what he told you,

01:03:43.031 --> 01:03:45.158
okay, but everything
is under control.

01:03:45.158 --> 01:03:47.160
Is it really under control?

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.288
- Is it really?
- Yeah.

01:03:51.164 --> 01:03:55.127
Jim, tell him what you told me.

01:03:55.127 --> 01:03:58.672
I said I'm worried
that you're getting too close.

01:03:58.672 --> 01:04:00.716
Are you getting
too close, Bobby?

01:04:00.716 --> 01:04:03.051
Yeah, I'm getting close.
I mean, how else are we going

01:04:03.051 --> 01:04:04.803
to get these guys?
Across the street?

01:04:04.803 --> 01:04:06.722
Too close to that world.

01:04:06.722 --> 01:04:10.309
Bobby. Where the fuck
is your wire?

01:04:10.309 --> 01:04:13.729
- Well, I already took it off.
- How are you going to get
a recording with this scumbag--

01:04:13.729 --> 01:04:16.190
I was afraid they were
going to find it.

01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:20.110
And then you tell Jimmy

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:22.654
that you're taking off tonight?

01:04:22.654 --> 01:04:25.282
What? No, uh...
I don't, I don't,

01:04:25.282 --> 01:04:27.659
I don't remember what I said.

01:04:27.659 --> 01:04:30.329
[Bobby on tape]<i>Taking the fucking night off.
Okay? Don't wait up.</i>

01:04:30.329 --> 01:04:32.206
Listen to me.

01:04:32.206 --> 01:04:34.458
Now, you stop this bullshit.

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:37.461
You get DeMeo on the tape
giving one order,

01:04:37.461 --> 01:04:40.297
just one order we'll wrap
this whole place up.

01:04:40.297 --> 01:04:42.591
Take all these pictures,
all these tapes

01:04:42.591 --> 01:04:46.720
and all the files on my desk,
so I could present it
to the department.

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.347
You gotta understand something.

01:04:48.347 --> 01:04:49.806
I'm telling you right now,

01:04:49.806 --> 01:04:52.434
if I fucking have to
come back here,

01:04:52.434 --> 01:04:54.394
I'm shutting this whole
fucking thing down.

01:04:54.394 --> 01:04:56.647
I don't know what's going on
in your fucked up head,

01:04:56.647 --> 01:05:00.400
but I don't like
the way you're acting.

01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.612
I want you to watch this
fucking guy, okay? Please.

01:05:06.156 --> 01:05:07.407
Okay?

01:05:14.289 --> 01:05:17.835
It's getting late,
so I'm gonna go to bed.

01:05:24.967 --> 01:05:26.218
[loud knocking]

01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:31.849
[whispers] That's not the knock.

01:05:31.849 --> 01:05:33.767
[knocking continues]

01:05:46.822 --> 01:05:47.823
Bobby?

01:06:10.679 --> 01:06:12.347
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
keep it down. Okay?

01:06:12.347 --> 01:06:14.183
Listen, my girl's
asleep in there.

01:06:14.183 --> 01:06:17.102
I fucked up. Bobby,
I fucked up bad.

01:06:17.102 --> 01:06:19.813
Calm down. Calm-calm down.
What happened?

01:06:19.813 --> 01:06:21.940
I don't know. The deal
was going like clockwork.

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.150
I don't know what came over me.

01:06:23.150 --> 01:06:26.195
[Bobby] <i>Fuck. The Colombians.</i>

01:06:29.281 --> 01:06:32.492
<i>Not only did he kill
his Cuban contacts
from Florida,</i>

01:06:32.492 --> 01:06:34.620
<i>but one of the dealers
he killed was related</i>

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:37.998
<i>to the head of a fucking
Colombian drug cartel.</i>

01:06:37.998 --> 01:06:41.502
<i>His cousin.
And worst of all, the other one</i>

01:06:41.502 --> 01:06:43.962
<i>was his goddamn girlfriend.</i>

01:06:43.962 --> 01:06:46.048
<i>Chris killed everybody.</i>

01:06:46.048 --> 01:06:49.051
Okay. All right?
Where are the bodies?

01:06:49.051 --> 01:06:50.469
I called the guys.

01:06:50.469 --> 01:06:51.720
I had to cut them in.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:53.472
What are you doing here then?

01:06:53.472 --> 01:06:55.807
I got to lay low for a while.

01:06:55.807 --> 01:06:57.643
Here? Are you out of your mind?

01:06:57.643 --> 01:06:59.102
They're fucking looking for me.

01:06:59.102 --> 01:07:00.896
If they find me,
they'll fucking kill me.

01:07:00.896 --> 01:07:03.065
[Bobby] <i>I was already looking
at a dead man,</i>

01:07:03.065 --> 01:07:05.526
<i>but I was also
seeing an opportunity.</i>

01:07:05.526 --> 01:07:06.818
Just go to Roy.

01:07:08.904 --> 01:07:10.364
I can't do that.

01:07:10.364 --> 01:07:12.491
Listen, maybe he can
make some calls.

01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:15.452
Pull some fucking strings
for you. I'll go there
with you. Chris.

01:07:15.452 --> 01:07:16.870
I gave them his name.

01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:17.955
What?

01:07:17.955 --> 01:07:19.373
I gave them his name.

01:07:19.373 --> 01:07:20.874
I told him my name
was Chris DeMeo.

01:07:20.874 --> 01:07:23.544
Chris fucking DeMeo.
I wasn't thinking.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:29.842
Right. Let's go to Roy.

01:07:33.595 --> 01:07:34.930
You don't know Roy.

01:07:37.057 --> 01:07:39.434
[Bobby] Chris? Chris?

01:07:41.103 --> 01:07:43.105
I'll fucking call you. Okay?

01:07:49.194 --> 01:07:50.988
Hey. Give me the wire.

01:08:00.664 --> 01:08:02.583
I know. What do
you want me to do?

01:08:10.632 --> 01:08:12.301
Okay, everybody's here.

01:08:12.301 --> 01:08:16.305
That's good.
One big happy family.

01:08:16.305 --> 01:08:18.056
Except for one.

01:08:22.311 --> 01:08:24.104
Look,

01:08:24.104 --> 01:08:26.315
I want you to think real hard
about what you do

01:08:26.315 --> 01:08:28.775
and say when I walk out of here.

01:08:28.775 --> 01:08:30.402
Because Roy's going to tell me,

01:08:30.402 --> 01:08:33.197
and I'm telling you,
I am promising you

01:08:33.197 --> 01:08:36.116
that I have almost
no fucking fuse left.

01:08:36.116 --> 01:08:39.161
Do you understand?
Huh, you understand?

01:08:45.292 --> 01:08:47.753
You find this son of a bitch.
You understand? You find him.

01:08:47.753 --> 01:08:50.297
- Yeah.
- Okay? I took you under my wing.

01:08:50.297 --> 01:08:53.634
You go down for this,
we go down. Okay?

01:08:53.634 --> 01:08:56.303
And there's only one
other way out of it. Okay?

01:08:56.303 --> 01:08:58.388
And I pray to God
it doesn't happen.

01:08:58.388 --> 01:09:00.724
It's not going to happen.
You got to understand something.

01:09:00.724 --> 01:09:03.352
- I raised him like my own.
- Oh, please.

01:09:03.352 --> 01:09:05.187
The next time we talk
this fucking kid

01:09:05.187 --> 01:09:07.231
better be out of
the picture, Roy.

01:09:07.231 --> 01:09:09.691
Or there's no talk.

01:09:09.691 --> 01:09:11.985
Better get him.

01:09:11.985 --> 01:09:14.321
[Bobby] <i>Roy's true colors
really showed
when he was pissed.</i>

01:09:14.321 --> 01:09:17.616
<i>And that day,
his color was bright red.</i>

01:09:17.616 --> 01:09:20.160
<i>It was obvious that
the shit hit the fan.</i>

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.703
Hey.

01:09:21.703 --> 01:09:23.288
Seen Chris?

01:09:23.288 --> 01:09:25.541
No, no, no, why?

01:09:27.793 --> 01:09:29.461
- You guys are close, right?
- Yeah.

01:09:32.256 --> 01:09:34.383
Find him.

01:09:34.383 --> 01:09:37.219
- Bring him to me.
- [Bobby] <i>He actually
looked concerned.</i>

01:09:37.219 --> 01:09:39.346
- Just bring him here, okay.
- Okay, yeah.

01:09:39.346 --> 01:09:41.723
- If you talk to him,
you call me.
- [Joseph] You got it, boss.

01:09:41.723 --> 01:09:44.309
[Bobby]<i>But I knew what would happen
to Chris if he came back here.</i>

01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:45.435
<i>Everybody did.</i>

01:09:45.435 --> 01:09:47.104
[man] No one's seen him.

01:09:47.104 --> 01:09:48.939
[Bobby]<i>I spent the next few days</i>

01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:51.233
<i>turning over every dirty stone
I could think of.</i>

01:09:51.233 --> 01:09:54.736
<i>It was like looking for
a junkie in a haystack.</i>

01:09:54.736 --> 01:09:57.739
<i>Now, while I was
out looking for Chris,</i>

01:09:57.739 --> 01:10:01.326
<i>the crew had other business
to attend to.</i>

01:10:01.326 --> 01:10:02.995
[Gina] Hey.<i>-Luca Santi.</i>

01:10:02.995 --> 01:10:05.122
Hi, Luca.

01:10:05.122 --> 01:10:10.043
[Bobby]<i>I thought I finally had Gina
figured out, but I was way off.</i>

01:10:12.171 --> 01:10:15.465
<i>They called it
the Gemini Method.</i>

01:10:15.465 --> 01:10:17.843
<i>Gina would lead
the marks to the door.</i>

01:10:17.843 --> 01:10:20.762
<i>A pretty face can really get
a guy's guard down.</i>

01:10:20.762 --> 01:10:23.140
<i>Roy made sure everyone knew
what they were doing.</i>

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.100
<i>I don't know how many times
they did it,</i>

01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:28.228
<i>but it had to be a lot.
They perfected it.</i>

01:10:28.228 --> 01:10:31.315
[Gina] Come on.

01:10:31.315 --> 01:10:33.942
[Bobby] <i>Roy had had it
with Luka's shortcomings</i>

01:10:33.942 --> 01:10:37.654
<i>and decided it was time
to take him out.</i>

01:10:37.654 --> 01:10:41.783
<i>Roy would start things off
by popping the poor bastard
in the head.</i>

01:10:41.783 --> 01:10:46.163
<i>And someone had to wrap
the head in a towel to keep
the bleeding under control.</i>

01:10:48.498 --> 01:10:52.503
<i>A knife in the heart
would not only make sure
that the bastard was dead,</i>

01:10:52.503 --> 01:10:55.464
<i>but a dead heart would also
stop the bleeding.</i>

01:10:55.464 --> 01:10:58.300
Gina, you okay?

01:10:58.300 --> 01:11:01.011
- Yeah.
- Drag him to the bathtub.

01:11:01.011 --> 01:11:05.182
[Bobby] <i>They'd hang the body
over the bathtub
and drain it dry.</i>

01:11:05.182 --> 01:11:07.851
<i>These fucking guys
sat around eating pizza</i>

01:11:07.851 --> 01:11:11.480
<i>while the body drained
in the tub.</i>

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:16.360
<i>Roy had one philosophy
no body, no crime.</i>

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:19.071
<i>So he did what he did best.</i>

01:11:19.071 --> 01:11:21.573
<i>He made that bastard disappear.</i>

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:31.041
<i>The last step was dumping
the parts
into separate dumpsters</i>

01:11:31.041 --> 01:11:34.294
<i>around town that were special
for food waste.</i>

01:11:34.294 --> 01:11:36.505
<i>They all got put
in a special part of the dump</i>

01:11:36.505 --> 01:11:39.132
<i>where they were buried
because food rots.</i>

01:11:39.132 --> 01:11:41.176
<i>And even if they brought dogs,</i>

01:11:41.176 --> 01:11:44.763
<i>the smell was so bad that
they wouldn't find shit.</i>

01:11:44.763 --> 01:11:47.558
<i>No body, no crime.</i>

01:11:47.558 --> 01:11:49.393
<i>About a week went by.</i>

01:11:49.393 --> 01:11:51.478
<i>Still no sign of Chris.</i>

01:11:51.478 --> 01:11:54.523
<i>The guys weren't really
scouring the earth
for him either.</i>

01:11:54.523 --> 01:11:56.775
<i>Roy was getting paranoid.</i>

01:11:56.775 --> 01:12:00.696
<i>The Colombians wanted blood.
Chris's blood.</i>

01:12:00.696 --> 01:12:02.781
<i>He sent his family out of town</i>

01:12:02.781 --> 01:12:05.158
<i>and locked himself up
in his house.</i>

01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:08.620
<i>One day, Roy spots a guy
parked outside
for a little too long,</i>

01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.456
<i>and he absolutely loses it.</i>

01:12:11.456 --> 01:12:15.460
<i>He was sure the Colombians
had sent a hitman
to take him out.</i>

01:12:15.460 --> 01:12:18.672
<i>Roy was MIA
for a while after that.</i>

01:12:18.672 --> 01:12:22.843
<i>Turns out the kid wasn't even
a Colombian hitman after all.</i>

01:12:22.843 --> 01:12:25.012
<i>He was just a kid who went
door to door</i>

01:12:25.012 --> 01:12:27.890
<i>selling vacuums to help
pay for college.</i>

01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:30.434
<i>- Roy was actually
torn up about it.</i>
- Shit.

01:12:30.434 --> 01:12:32.936
Shit!<i>-He didn't leave
his house for days.</i>

01:12:32.936 --> 01:12:35.689
<i>Plus he had Paul Castellano
and the entire</i>

01:12:35.689 --> 01:12:38.901
<i>Gambino family telling him that
if he didn't kill Chris</i>

01:12:38.901 --> 01:12:41.195
<i>that he would take his place.</i>

01:12:41.195 --> 01:12:44.448
<i>And nobody knew
where Chris was.</i>

01:12:46.742 --> 01:12:51.079
<i>For a week I was looking
for that son of a bitch.</i>

01:12:51.079 --> 01:12:52.372
<i>But in the end...</i>

01:12:52.372 --> 01:12:53.498
James?

01:12:53.498 --> 01:12:55.083
<i>...he found me.</i>

01:12:55.083 --> 01:12:57.503
[dramatic music playing]

01:12:59.755 --> 01:13:01.423
[Chris] Don't worry.

01:13:01.423 --> 01:13:03.509
You ain't gonna wake him.

01:13:14.770 --> 01:13:17.189
It's over, Chris.

01:13:17.189 --> 01:13:20.108
You're right, Bobby, it is.

01:13:20.108 --> 01:13:23.320
You killed a police officer,
man, that's my fucking partner.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:26.823
I fucking trusted you, Bobby.

01:13:26.823 --> 01:13:29.034
What you don't understand--

01:13:29.034 --> 01:13:32.829
No. Shut up. Shut the fuck up.
You mother--

01:13:32.829 --> 01:13:36.625
Fuck! You're fucking cop, Bobby.

01:13:41.797 --> 01:13:45.592
I came to you for your help,
for your guidance.

01:13:45.592 --> 01:13:49.555
And you've got
a fucking family tree.

01:13:49.555 --> 01:13:52.766
Don't even know what Roy's gonna
do to you when he finds out.

01:13:55.519 --> 01:13:59.648
This a lot bigger than
a, a few dead Colombians.

01:13:59.648 --> 01:14:00.691
Don't you?

01:14:00.691 --> 01:14:03.318
Listen to me, Chris.

01:14:03.318 --> 01:14:05.946
We are in the same boat here, okay?

01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:08.365
We're both fucking dead.

01:14:08.365 --> 01:14:10.617
Okay?

01:14:10.617 --> 01:14:12.744
We can make a deal, okay?

01:14:12.744 --> 01:14:14.538
Listen, just listen to me.

01:14:14.538 --> 01:14:17.833
You just give them
all up, all right?

01:14:17.833 --> 01:14:20.335
We're going to put you
in witness protection.

01:14:20.335 --> 01:14:22.838
I can make that fucking call
right now,

01:14:22.838 --> 01:14:24.339
you're fucking dead otherwise.

01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:27.301
I may be a lot of things, Bobby,

01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:30.262
but a rat ain't one of them.

01:14:30.262 --> 01:14:33.849
I need you to sit down now.

01:14:33.849 --> 01:14:36.310
Sit the fuck down, Bobby.

01:14:37.978 --> 01:14:39.605
I'm sitting down, Chris.

01:14:41.523 --> 01:14:42.816
All right?

01:14:50.115 --> 01:14:52.659
Chris. Chris, listen to me.

01:14:52.659 --> 01:14:55.871
You call Roy right now,
and I swear to God,

01:14:55.871 --> 01:14:59.208
he is going to
kill us both. Okay?

01:15:04.171 --> 01:15:05.923
- Roy?
- [Roy] <i>Chris.</i>

01:15:05.923 --> 01:15:08.133
<i>- Jesus Christ.</i>
- Yeah, it's me.

01:15:08.133 --> 01:15:10.802
<i>Where the fuck have you been?</i>

01:15:10.802 --> 01:15:14.431
Look, I can't really say
where I've been, but--

01:15:14.431 --> 01:15:15.974
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:15:15.974 --> 01:15:18.310
Look, just listen to me, okay?

01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:19.978
I got something
that's going to knock

01:15:19.978 --> 01:15:21.313
your fucking socks off.

01:15:21.313 --> 01:15:23.690
I know I fucked up big, okay?

01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:25.734
But what I got,
it's going to make you
forgive me

01:15:25.734 --> 01:15:28.737
for all of it.<i>-Forgive you?</i>

01:15:28.737 --> 01:15:31.240
<i>Get your ass over here, Chris.</i>

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.658
I'm leaving soon.

01:15:32.658 --> 01:15:34.451
<i>- Now.</i>
- Okay. I'm bringing Bob--

01:15:34.451 --> 01:15:37.162
[dial tone]

01:15:39.665 --> 01:15:40.749
[unintelligible]

01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:44.837
Let's go, Bobby.

01:15:48.507 --> 01:15:51.176
Okay. All right.

01:15:56.932 --> 01:15:59.643
<i>That was the longest
ride of my life.</i>

01:15:59.643 --> 01:16:02.104
<i>I knew I was dead on arrival.</i>

01:16:02.104 --> 01:16:04.523
<i>A million things were
racing through my head.</i>

01:16:04.523 --> 01:16:06.984
<i>But one of them was
muting all the others.</i>

01:16:06.984 --> 01:16:08.986
<i>I didn't care
about the cheating.</i>

01:16:08.986 --> 01:16:10.988
<i>I didn't care about anything.</i>

01:16:10.988 --> 01:16:13.991
<i>I just wanted Mary back.</i>

01:16:13.991 --> 01:16:18.829
<i>But in that moment,
in that moment, I realized...</i>

01:16:18.829 --> 01:16:21.915
<i>that I didn't deserve her.</i>

01:16:47.858 --> 01:16:48.859
Fuck.

01:16:55.282 --> 01:16:58.410
Why did he have a gun on you?

01:16:58.410 --> 01:17:00.245
He was out of his mind.

01:17:00.245 --> 01:17:03.290
I mean, he was going to
come here and kill everybody.

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:04.958
I mean, he showed
up my door acting like

01:17:04.958 --> 01:17:06.752
a fucking lunatic,
saying he was going to use me

01:17:06.752 --> 01:17:08.670
as a decoy. I mean, he was
going to shoot you, Roy.

01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:10.756
He said he was going
to fucking blow away

01:17:10.756 --> 01:17:12.466
fucking everybody, including me.

01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:14.426
I mean, he was
fucking out of control.

01:17:19.389 --> 01:17:20.599
Ah, fuck.

01:17:21.934 --> 01:17:22.976
Put him in the car.

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:26.271
- Fuck.
- It's just fucked, man.

01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:28.023
Crazy.

01:17:28.023 --> 01:17:29.608
Put him in the car.

01:18:08.647 --> 01:18:11.525
[Bobby] <i>He didn't say a word
the entire drive.</i>

01:18:31.170 --> 01:18:34.965
<i>If I was going to make
a move, it was going to
have to be soon.</i>

01:18:34.965 --> 01:18:38.427
<i>But machine guns were
going to be a problem.</i>

01:18:38.427 --> 01:18:41.388
[Roy] Will you open the trunk?

01:18:56.486 --> 01:18:58.322
Sorry, kid.

01:19:00.199 --> 01:19:02.618
[Bobby]<i>Roy loved Chris like a son.</i>

01:19:14.588 --> 01:19:16.215
Don't shoot him
in the face, okay?

01:19:37.861 --> 01:19:38.862
Get out of the way.

01:19:48.997 --> 01:19:50.832
[gunshots]

01:19:59.299 --> 01:20:01.301
[Bobby] <i>I found out later that
in order to appease</i>

01:20:01.301 --> 01:20:03.345
<i>the Colombians, they had
to leave them out there.</i>

01:20:03.345 --> 01:20:05.138
<i>You know, make
a big fucking show of it.</i>

01:20:05.138 --> 01:20:06.932
<i>Make the news and all that.</i>

01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:12.646
<i>I wasn't scared sitting
in the front this time.</i>

01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:17.484
<i>Felt like a cat
with nine fucking lives.</i>

01:20:45.053 --> 01:20:49.057
Come by the apartment
tomorrow night.

01:20:49.057 --> 01:20:51.435
Eight o'clock.

01:20:51.435 --> 01:20:53.854
- For what?
- Play some cards.

01:20:58.942 --> 01:21:01.069
<i>James was dead. Chris was dead.</i>

01:21:01.069 --> 01:21:02.613
<i>The whole thing was
a shit show.</i>

01:21:05.699 --> 01:21:09.369
<i>I never stepped one foot
inside the Gemini Lounge again.</i>

01:21:22.174 --> 01:21:24.051
You good?

01:21:24.051 --> 01:21:25.385
Yeah.

01:21:46.740 --> 01:21:48.492
That's goodbye.

01:21:48.492 --> 01:21:50.577
I don't, I don't understand.

01:21:50.577 --> 01:21:51.912
I told you I was working

01:21:51.912 --> 01:21:53.497
that job, get some extra cash

01:21:53.497 --> 01:21:55.624
on the side, and, um,

01:21:55.624 --> 01:21:58.418
I just wanted you to have it.

01:21:58.418 --> 01:22:01.797
You might hear some things
about me in the next
couple of days.

01:22:01.797 --> 01:22:03.757
What is going on, Bobby?

01:22:03.757 --> 01:22:08.136
I just want you to know
that I'm so sorry.

01:22:08.136 --> 01:22:11.265
For everything, and...

01:22:12.808 --> 01:22:16.103
I really hope...

01:22:16.103 --> 01:22:18.814
that you find the happiness
that you deserve, honey.

01:22:25.028 --> 01:22:26.029
Bobby.

01:22:33.579 --> 01:22:35.455
[Bobby]<i>The department did not take us</i>

01:22:35.455 --> 01:22:37.457
<i>going over their heads lightly.</i>

01:22:37.457 --> 01:22:40.169
<i>We got a fellow officer killed.</i>

01:22:40.169 --> 01:22:44.047
<i>They had no choice but to make
an example out of Rick and me.</i>

01:22:44.047 --> 01:22:46.091
<i>If it wasn't for all
the evidence we got,</i>

01:22:46.091 --> 01:22:49.344
<i>things could have
turned out a lot worse for us.</i>

01:22:49.344 --> 01:22:51.722
<i>But none of it
saw the light of day.</i>

01:22:51.722 --> 01:22:55.225
<i>The Department decided
to save face
and filed everything away.</i>

01:22:57.603 --> 01:22:59.521
<i>It looked
like business as usual,</i>

01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:02.232
<i>but things were never the same.</i>

01:23:02.232 --> 01:23:04.401
<i>Roy was getting
too much FBI attention</i>

01:23:04.401 --> 01:23:07.154
<i>and was convinced that
his days were numbered.</i>

01:23:07.154 --> 01:23:08.822
<i>He was right.</i>

01:23:08.822 --> 01:23:11.950
<i>Paul Costellano
ordered the hit.</i>

01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:17.122
<i>And in the end,

did the deed.</i>

01:23:19.166 --> 01:23:24.338
<i>As for me, I couldn't
let it all be for nothing.</i>

01:23:24.338 --> 01:23:26.757
<i>I made a call
and set up a meeting.</i>

01:23:26.757 --> 01:23:30.302
