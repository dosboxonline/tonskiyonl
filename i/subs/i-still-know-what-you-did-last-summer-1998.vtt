01:51.385 --> 01:54.303
Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.

01:56.681 --> 01:59.766
lt's been a year
since my last confession.

01:59.976 --> 02:07.058
l never told anyone this. Not my
mom, the police, not my friends.

02:08.151 --> 02:14.403
Except for the ones who were there,
and they're not around anymore.

02:16.116 --> 02:20.494
- You see, l ...
- Yes?

02:24.708 --> 02:27.460
l killed a man.

02:28.837 --> 02:31.624
But it was an accident.

02:32.383 --> 02:36.843
A terrible accident, and l've tried
to get past it, but l can't.

02:37.971 --> 02:43.213
- Go on.
- l have these ... dreams.

02:44.352 --> 02:47.637
Really horrible dreams.

02:47.855 --> 02:51.556
This man is always there with me.

02:51.734 --> 02:58.816
He was a killer. He murdered Barry
and Helen, but l got away with it.

03:03.370 --> 03:08.874
l guess l just need to deal with it,
you know?

03:10.043 --> 03:12.794
Face the fear and the guilt.

03:13.880 --> 03:16.038
Finally say his name.

03:17.717 --> 03:20.836
Ben Willis.

03:23.389 --> 03:27.256
- Ben Willis.
- l know.

03:32.689 --> 03:35.359
You know? How could you ..?

03:38.112 --> 03:40.684
l know what you did last summer.

03:46.411 --> 03:51.072
Nice to see you find political
science so stimulating, Miss James.

03:56.421 --> 03:59.255
Sorry.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.719
- Julie, wait. Are you okay?
- l'm fine.

04:12.936 --> 04:17.596
- You sure? You don't seem fine.
- l had another dream, Will.

04:17.773 --> 04:24.144
- The one in the shower?
- ln a church. God, it was so real.

04:24.322 --> 04:27.607
l thought the dreams were over.

04:27.783 --> 04:30.654
- lt'll get better.
- lt can't get worse.

04:30.828 --> 04:36.450
l've freaked out in class before.
l can't study, l can't sleep.

04:36.625 --> 04:39.163
l'm this close to failing school.

04:39.336 --> 04:41.744
Happy Fourth of July!

04:45.967 --> 04:49.585
- lt was one year ago.
- lt's the anniversary.

04:49.762 --> 04:54.258
- You've just got to take it easy.
- l'm really trying.

04:54.433 --> 04:56.971
Sometimes l wonder why l came here.

04:57.144 --> 05:01.189
- To get out of Southport?
- Right. Now l remember.

05:01.357 --> 05:04.476
Are you going away for the Fourth?

05:04.651 --> 05:09.360
l'll be studying for the finals.
The joys of summer school.

05:09.531 --> 05:14.276
Are you okay? Sure?
You're definitely okay?

05:14.452 --> 05:17.656
Yes, l'm definitely okay.

05:17.831 --> 05:21.414
Thanks for the talk, Will.
You're good to me.

05:21.585 --> 05:24.620
- l am?
- Yeah.

05:24.837 --> 05:29.334
- Okay, l'll see you later.
- Okay. Bye.

05:35.264 --> 05:40.969
- Julie.
- Ray? God, what are you doing here?

05:41.144 --> 05:44.430
l got in early. Who was that guy?

05:44.606 --> 05:49.149
That's Will. He's a friend.
You'd like him. We're just friends.

05:49.319 --> 05:54.230
All guys trying to pick up a girl
try the "good friend" thing first.

05:54.407 --> 05:57.859
Ready to go? You know the drill.

05:58.036 --> 06:03.456
The Croaker Queen Pageant.
Small-town fun, but nice.

06:03.624 --> 06:06.376
- Ray, l can't.
- Can't what?

06:09.296 --> 06:15.500
l feel like l haven't healed enough
to go back. So please understand.

06:15.719 --> 06:18.505
- l understand.
- lt's not you.

06:18.721 --> 06:23.846
lt's all me. ln my head.
l want to go back.

06:24.060 --> 06:29.101
l want to be fine, to be with you.
l want it all to be like it was.

06:29.273 --> 06:34.564
lt just isn't. Why don't you stay up
here? Fireworks over the river ...

06:34.737 --> 06:40.442
l have to work, Julie. My boat's in
Southport, remember? But it's cool.

06:40.617 --> 06:47.236
You need your space from Croakerland
and probably from me too.

06:48.416 --> 06:52.960
- Ray ...
- Just forget it.

07:00.553 --> 07:03.720
l'm scared, that's all.

08:44.360 --> 08:47.646
Shit.

10:24.454 --> 10:29.200
What the hell are you doing
in my closet?

10:29.376 --> 10:33.587
l thought you left.
l just wanted to borrow your skirt.

10:33.755 --> 10:38.547
- Jesus, that was heart attack time!
- Can l have the knife now?

10:38.719 --> 10:43.546
- Come out with me tonight.
- l just tried to stab you.

10:43.723 --> 10:48.848
- l hardly feel like dancing.
- What's the matter?

10:49.020 --> 10:53.432
- l think l hurt Ray's feelings.
- Listen to me.

10:53.649 --> 10:57.065
Ray is a great guy.
Nothing against old Ray, -

10:57.236 --> 11:00.770
- but he's so ... Ray.

11:00.989 --> 11:05.782
He lives in Southport.
Will lives right down the street.

11:05.953 --> 11:09.652
- But there's nothing between us.
- Yet. Nothing yet.

11:09.831 --> 11:16.035
l'm working at the club. And you,
Dancing Queen, are coming with me.

11:16.212 --> 11:21.206
- No, l'm not ...
- Yes, you are. What did I say?

11:32.686 --> 11:35.640
You know what l want to do to you,
right?

11:35.856 --> 11:39.983
- No.
- ls there a place we can be alone?

11:40.151 --> 11:43.686
- l don't think so. lt's crowded.
- Come on.

11:43.864 --> 11:49.818
- l just want to talk for a minute.
- lf it only takes a minute, no way.

11:49.994 --> 11:54.455
l'll talk real, real slow.

11:54.624 --> 11:59.830
Not at work. Do me a favour.
Ask Julie to dance.

12:04.424 --> 12:08.173
You know, Jules, you're the most
beautiful woman in the bar tonight.

12:08.345 --> 12:11.880
Ty, you're an unstoppable
force of nature.

12:12.057 --> 12:17.680
You better recognise.
That's how my species survives.

12:17.895 --> 12:22.771
- So, what's up? Wanna dance?
- Say yes. No means yes.

12:22.941 --> 12:27.687
Ty, have you seen my people dance?
We do the mouth thing. Snap fingers.

12:27.863 --> 12:32.075
You can always
just stand there and watch me.

12:32.242 --> 12:35.611
l have an idea.
Why don't we all go dance?

12:35.787 --> 12:37.495
Let's go.

12:46.256 --> 12:51.000
Oh, what do you know?
Will Benson, looking fine.

12:51.177 --> 12:56.384
- Did you tell him l'd be here?
- l told him you wouldn't be here.

12:56.557 --> 13:02.227
- And he came anyway. What's up?
- This wasn't my idea.

13:02.396 --> 13:05.266
- This wasn't ...
- You'll be fine. Do your thing.

13:05.441 --> 13:10.398
- Be good, Julie.
- You want to get a drink?

14:34.358 --> 14:40.231
Hey ... Did you see something
back there?

14:40.406 --> 14:47.321
l'm really sorry, but l've got
to go home right now. l'm sorry.

15:27.701 --> 15:30.369
Morning.

15:32.371 --> 15:35.456
- l love when they do that.
- That could break the machine.

15:37.418 --> 15:40.537
- That's Ty.
- My number's unlisted.

15:40.712 --> 15:45.790
Relax. We've been dating for three
months and he is not a stalker.

15:48.262 --> 15:52.259
This is Mark in the Morning
from Magic 96. 7 radio station.

15:52.432 --> 15:58.552
lt's Mark in the Morning! Put on
the speakerphone. Oh, my God. Hi.

15:58.729 --> 16:05.017
- Hi, Mark. l'm Karla Wilson.
- WeII, what are you doing at home?

16:05.194 --> 16:10.983
- l'm actually in school ...
- Want to win our magic getaway?

16:12.117 --> 16:17.075
I hope you remember your geography.
What is the capitaI of BraziI?

16:17.289 --> 16:24.086
- Okay. The capital of Brazil ...
- One question, one great getaway.

16:24.254 --> 16:29.710
KarIa, we need an answer.
No Iooking it up. Five seconds.

16:29.884 --> 16:36.088
- Four, three, two ...
- Rio de Janeiro!

16:36.307 --> 16:39.557
- Oh, no. Did you say Rio?
- No.

16:40.478 --> 16:45.103
- Yes ..? Yes!
- You won the 96. 7 quickie getaway!

16:45.315 --> 16:49.360
A trip for four to Tower Bay IsIand
in the fabuIous Bahamas!

16:49.528 --> 16:52.944
- l can't hear.
- We'II caII back with the detaiIs.

16:53.115 --> 16:55.652
- What's your favourite station?
- 96.7!

16:55.825 --> 16:58.862
That's what I thought.

16:59.037 --> 17:05.655
Okay, who am l gonna take? Tyrell,
my parents, cousins ... Okay, Julie.

17:05.835 --> 17:11.505
Mark said four tickets. So you
have to think of someone to bring.

17:18.097 --> 17:21.300
Ray? Phone.

17:29.983 --> 17:33.019
- Hi.
- I'm reaIIy gIad you caIIed.

17:33.194 --> 17:38.319
l'm sorry. l shouldn't have left
so fast. l just ...

17:38.533 --> 17:41.201
It's okay. Ray, Iisten ...

17:41.368 --> 17:47.074
Karla won a trip to the Bahamas,
to this island called Tower Bay.

17:47.249 --> 17:51.246
- She wants us to go with her.
- The Bahamas?

17:51.420 --> 17:59.297
It's a great chance for us to hang
out in the sun, drink, swim ...

17:59.470 --> 18:03.965
... and, well, you know.

18:04.140 --> 18:07.509
- This weekend?
- Yeah.

18:07.727 --> 18:13.812
- You wouldn't go away with me.
- lt's not you. lt's Southport.

18:13.983 --> 18:18.940
- And, God, it's the Bahamas. Free.
- You have to seII his ass on it?

18:21.073 --> 18:28.403
- l really want us to be together.
- We're in the middle of a big run.

18:28.580 --> 18:34.120
lt's been crazy. We go back out
later. l don't think l can make it.

18:36.254 --> 18:39.089
Will you try? For me, please?

18:39.257 --> 18:42.792
Yeah, l'll try, but ... Listen.

18:42.969 --> 18:49.172
If I don't make it up, go ahead.
Have a reaIIy great time.

18:49.350 --> 18:53.050
Ray, for me, try, please.

18:53.270 --> 18:56.935
- l really miss you.
- l miss you, too.

18:57.107 --> 18:59.978
Okay.

19:00.152 --> 19:03.106
Bye.

19:06.616 --> 19:13.034
Dude, we haven't caught dick for
days. She asked you to the Bahamas.

19:13.206 --> 19:17.250
Fuck it, man. You've got to go.
l'll ride up with you.

19:17.460 --> 19:21.410
- Yeah. Stupid ...
- Yeah, stupid.

19:21.631 --> 19:25.462
What were you thinking, man?

19:25.634 --> 19:29.963
l'll show you
what l've been thinking.

19:33.100 --> 19:38.972
Whoa, Ray. Damn. Thanks, but l'll
need some time to think about it.

19:39.147 --> 19:45.149
- Nice fit, huh?
- l'll call and tell her l'm coming.

19:45.319 --> 19:48.653
No, surprise her. She'll be psyched.

19:48.823 --> 19:53.733
Yeah. All right, clean up.

19:55.079 --> 20:00.204
Will you please forget about Ray?
That boy has got fish on the brains.

20:00.376 --> 20:03.826
- Yeah, but ...
- But nothing. Where are we going?

20:04.004 --> 20:08.417
- The Bahamas.
- Where are we going ..?

20:08.592 --> 20:10.880
The Bahamas!

20:21.520 --> 20:24.094
- Try the harmony.
- You try it. l'll lead.

20:24.273 --> 20:30.560
- You, lead? You suck.
- Fuck you. l sound just like him.

20:33.073 --> 20:38.198
- You don't sound anything like him.
- Are you deaf?

20:38.370 --> 20:43.874
l'm quitting this band, man.
l'm going solo.

20:44.042 --> 20:47.577
Oh, shit.

20:52.842 --> 20:56.460
- Let's just go on and find a phone.
- No.

20:56.638 --> 21:01.014
Come on. The guy looks dead, man.

21:01.225 --> 21:03.798
Maybe not.

21:05.229 --> 21:08.395
What are you doing, man?

21:21.869 --> 21:25.036
This is fucked up, man.

21:44.599 --> 21:47.268
Shit.

22:02.949 --> 22:04.907
Shit.

22:15.253 --> 22:17.246
Dave!

22:24.011 --> 22:26.799
No!

23:04.050 --> 23:07.750
Girl, it's getting down to the wire.

23:07.929 --> 23:12.175
He's not coming.
l just thought ...

23:12.975 --> 23:19.143
- You left him four messages. Four.
- He said he'd try.

23:19.314 --> 23:23.181
Try is like maybe, Julie.
Try is bullshit.

23:23.360 --> 23:27.060
- He does work hard.
- My ass ...

23:27.238 --> 23:33.323
He's breaking your heart because he
can. l hate to say l told you so.

23:33.536 --> 23:36.738
Then don't.

23:37.331 --> 23:40.415
Oh, my God.

23:40.584 --> 23:44.534
What's happening, lovers?
Are we gonna get tropical?

23:44.713 --> 23:52.175
Let me talk to you for a minute ...
What's up, Jules?

23:52.346 --> 23:56.971
Julie, l'm really sorry about Will.
But he's my friend, too.

23:57.141 --> 23:59.348
My ticket shouldn't go to waste.

23:59.560 --> 24:05.016
Where there's a Will, there's a way.
Let's start having fun!

24:05.190 --> 24:08.524
ls there a problem?

24:08.694 --> 24:13.191
No, there's no problem,
because we're going to the Bahamas.

24:13.366 --> 24:19.201
- You're goddamn right.
- Right. We're going to the Bahamas!

24:27.754 --> 24:34.005
- l'm in the exit row. Wrong row.
- Are you okay?

24:34.176 --> 24:38.044
Yeah, l'm fine.

24:38.264 --> 24:42.557
Think of happy memories
from your childhood.

24:42.726 --> 24:49.345
And if l don't have any? l can't
relax going 500 miles an hour.

24:49.525 --> 24:54.316
Fumes build up in the fuel tanks.
Planes go down for no reason at all.

24:54.487 --> 25:00.407
- Getting hit by lightning is ...
- Yeah, and planes hit other planes.

25:00.577 --> 25:05.653
You're gonna get hit
if you don't quit bitching.

25:05.832 --> 25:08.749
Some folks just can't fly.

25:11.795 --> 25:17.252
- l'm the king of the world!
- l'm the king of the world!

25:17.468 --> 25:22.046
- Just breathe, Tyrell.
- Get away from me.

25:22.222 --> 25:25.259
lt's not a macho thing. lt's about
equilibrium in your inner ear.

25:25.434 --> 25:31.768
You just have to get used to it.
Some folks just can't sail.

25:31.940 --> 25:38.688
And it's the only way on or off the
island, except for the coast guard.

25:38.863 --> 25:43.489
- lt looks pretty remote.
- Tourists want sun, sea, solitude.

25:43.659 --> 25:48.486
- How much longer?
- A few minutes. Hang in there.

25:48.664 --> 25:51.036
Let it out. Just watch the boat.

26:14.689 --> 26:21.307
lf there's anything l can do to make
your stay better, please just ask.

26:22.446 --> 26:27.440
l'm Darick. l'll be at your service
for the duration of your stay.

26:27.617 --> 26:33.490
Old man, l have to work fast.
The season's almost over.

26:33.707 --> 26:38.285
With this weather you're already
out of time. Old man, my ass.

26:54.267 --> 26:58.479
- Beautiful.
- Look at this.

27:02.984 --> 27:07.196
We are here.
We have arrived in paradise!

27:12.910 --> 27:18.201
You've got to be shitting me ...
Look at this cat.

27:18.416 --> 27:23.326
- Yo, what's up, my brother?
- l think we found your brother.

27:23.504 --> 27:27.418
- Your brother.
- You know what l was saying ...

27:27.591 --> 27:30.047
Are you looking for some bud?

27:30.219 --> 27:33.718
l got some bat guano.
l got the cream jeans.

27:33.889 --> 27:36.890
Anything you need, Titus got.

27:37.059 --> 27:43.392
- No, but thank you very much.
- What about the sweet young ladies?

27:43.564 --> 27:47.609
- Anything l can do?
- Take a bath.

27:47.777 --> 27:50.528
Damn, that's cold, woman. All right.

27:50.696 --> 27:55.192
lf you need some weed,
l'll get with you later.

27:55.618 --> 28:00.160

- Beat it.

28:22.393 --> 28:25.062
Hello?

28:30.317 --> 28:33.188
- Where is everyone?
- Good question.

28:35.447 --> 28:38.613
Excuse me ... Excuse me.

28:41.328 --> 28:45.372
l'll scare somebody up. Hello?

28:45.539 --> 28:48.909
Yo ..? Shit!

28:57.593 --> 29:02.006

- Checking in. Karla Wilson.

29:02.181 --> 29:07.471
Oh, yes. Well, let's roll out
the red carpet.

29:07.686 --> 29:09.560
Our contest winners are here.

29:09.730 --> 29:14.190
- Last name first. First name last.
- Nice dog you got there, man.

29:14.358 --> 29:19.780
- Not really. He eats guys like you.
- You got a problem with something?

29:19.948 --> 29:25.736
- l don't have problems, pal.
- This is such a beautiful hotel.

29:27.538 --> 29:32.164
Built in the 1 930's
for one of the Rockefeller clan.

29:32.375 --> 29:34.285
There's a lot of history here.
Judy Garland spent the night here.

29:34.461 --> 29:38.162
- President Nixon ...
- Okay. We get it. lt's old.

29:38.340 --> 29:43.879
lt'll outlive you, l'm sure.
Put that down, please.

29:44.053 --> 29:47.505
Sorry.

29:49.100 --> 29:55.352
"Wilson" ... comma. "Karla."

29:57.358 --> 30:01.485
Oh ... You're in 201 and 202.

30:01.653 --> 30:07.194
- ls that a bad thing?
- No, not at all. Not at all.

30:07.368 --> 30:11.910
- Those are our honeymoon suites.
- Your what?

30:12.080 --> 30:16.374
l take it
you kids haven't exchanged vows.

30:16.543 --> 30:21.881
- We haven't exchanged anything.
- Julie, come on. That'll be fine.

30:22.090 --> 30:29.254
Our off-season staff of five
will tend to your every need.

30:29.430 --> 30:34.555
- Did you say off-season?
- lt's the Fourth of July weekend.

30:34.769 --> 30:38.635
Storm season begins today
like clockwork.

30:38.814 --> 30:41.731
lt's our version of winter.

30:44.153 --> 30:49.229
That's 201 and 202. Scrabble
and Parcheesi in the lounge.

30:49.449 --> 30:52.699
Enjoy.

30:52.869 --> 30:58.741
Ain't nothing free in this world.
l wanted you to have a great trip.

30:58.958 --> 31:03.287
We will. Don't worry about that.
We got the island to ourselves.

31:03.463 --> 31:08.836
- And it's been blue skies all day.
- Guys, this is us. 202.

31:09.009 --> 31:13.588
- The bags.
- 201 and 202.

31:13.764 --> 31:16.800
- Don't use these much.
- Why?

31:16.975 --> 31:21.803
No reason. They're fancy rooms
for kids your age.

31:21.980 --> 31:26.606
- We won a competition.
- And what did you have to do?

31:26.818 --> 31:30.436
- Guess the capital of Brazil.
- Rio, baby.

31:31.865 --> 31:37.024
Good for you, girl. And where
would you like l put your bags?

31:37.202 --> 31:42.743
- You can put our stuff back here.
- You promised.

31:42.916 --> 31:48.337
- l also promised Tyrell.
- What's up? You're killing me.

31:48.505 --> 31:53.332
l can sleep on the couch so they can
practice that reaI honeymoon.

31:53.509 --> 31:58.255
l've been doing this since before
you were a gleam in your dad's eye.

31:59.891 --> 32:04.184
- You sure it's cool with you?
- Sure. As long as you don't snore.

32:04.353 --> 32:09.015
lf l get out of hand,
you can toss something at me.

32:15.864 --> 32:19.779
- He looks pretty beat up.
- Yeah. But he seems certain.

32:19.952 --> 32:26.749
His friend was killed by a Ben
Willis, who had a hook on his hand -

32:26.917 --> 32:30.451
- and was driving a BMW.

32:31.712 --> 32:35.331
Look, there's no body.
No other vehicle involved.

32:35.508 --> 32:42.673
He feel asleep at the wheel, crashed
his truck and fell into a ditch.

32:42.890 --> 32:49.390
- He suffered severe head trauma.
- lt'll all come back to him.

32:51.773 --> 32:55.308
Doctor, number three just flatlined.

32:57.737 --> 33:01.521
Get me some help.
l've got a flatline, room three.

33:14.462 --> 33:18.044
Let's get a couple of drinks.

33:18.215 --> 33:21.465
Oh, shit.

33:21.635 --> 33:24.755
- This bar is ...
- Empty?

33:24.930 --> 33:30.137
- You boys lost?
- Wow, a human being.

33:30.310 --> 33:34.889
- Tell me this isn't the bar scene.
- You want a drink?

33:35.106 --> 33:40.100
- We didn't dress up for nothing.
- You're dressed up?

33:40.278 --> 33:46.564
All right, Will, we got a Planter's
Punch, a Singapore Sling ...

33:46.742 --> 33:50.906
How about a Mai-motherfucking-Tai?
Yeah ...

33:51.121 --> 33:56.246
How about some lD ..?
l'm kidding.

33:57.794 --> 34:01.922
- This place isn't quiet, it's dead.
- Well, it's ...

34:02.132 --> 34:05.749
- The last day of the season.
- Why are you still here?

34:08.346 --> 34:12.260
That's none
of your goddamn business.

34:12.475 --> 34:17.266
- l think l smell man trouble.
- Not anymore.

34:17.480 --> 34:22.105
- Did he dump you?
- No. l shot him.

34:25.904 --> 34:30.197
Now, what you boys want
is a Dark and Stormy.

34:30.367 --> 34:35.657
A little rum, ginger beer, Tabasco.
lt's good. Trust me.

34:35.830 --> 34:39.958
Am l bad? He's kind of cute, right?

34:40.126 --> 34:45.500
- And he has a crush on you. But?
- But l miss Ray.

34:45.672 --> 34:49.967
- l really do. l tried to call him.
- Ray made up his own mind.

34:50.135 --> 34:56.469
So you're free. For 48 hours, your
smile is a frown turned upside down.

34:57.601 --> 35:01.432
- Here comes my baby.
- You like the outfit?

35:01.604 --> 35:06.480
No, l love it. Cool bar, right?

35:06.651 --> 35:10.066
They all look the same, once you've
worked in one. Right, sister?

35:10.237 --> 35:15.528
- You look beautiful.
- l'm Julie. This is Karla.

35:15.702 --> 35:19.829
Nancy. Well, welcome to
Tower Bay's most happening hot spot.

35:19.997 --> 35:23.615
Our room is the happening hot spot.

35:23.792 --> 35:29.130
- Four Dark and Stormies.
- All right. To a great weekend.

35:29.297 --> 35:32.085
Screw the weather.

35:35.888 --> 35:38.093
What do you do around here for fun?

35:38.264 --> 35:45.430
Make fun of tourists.
Or let them make fun of themselves.

35:45.605 --> 35:49.519
- Karaoke. Perfect.
- That's what l'm talking about.

35:49.733 --> 35:54.692
- Don't even think about it.
- Don't listen to the party-poopers.

35:54.864 --> 35:58.398
This is for someone who needs it.

35:58.575 --> 36:01.362
- So one single with extra cheese.
- No.

36:01.578 --> 36:04.863
- Yes, Julie.
- No ... No!

36:05.081 --> 36:10.917
- What did l say?
- Come on, Julie. Come on ...

36:12.339 --> 36:15.007
Julie in the house!

36:15.174 --> 36:21.343
Ladies and gentlemen, a round
of applause for my very best friend.

36:21.514 --> 36:27.219
- Julie James!
- Julie in the house. Julie ...

36:30.564 --> 36:34.513
- All right ... Thank you, Karla.
- You're welcome.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.158
Are you happy?

36:56.005 --> 36:58.792
Hi, Will ...

37:11.144 --> 37:13.136
Everyone's a goddamn singer.

37:17.317 --> 37:20.436
l don't know the lyrics. Hold on.

37:25.867 --> 37:33.909
lt's him. He did something
to the screen. l swear to God.

37:34.083 --> 37:37.452
- Julie, what's wrong?
- l swear to God, it said ...

37:39.504 --> 37:45.589
- Julie, what are you talking about?
- Nothing.

37:45.761 --> 37:49.627
Where are you going? Julie?
Shit ...

38:45.650 --> 38:50.858
- Oh, my God. Will, l'm so sorry.
- lt's my fault.

38:51.072 --> 38:56.066
- l shouldn't have. l didn't think.
- This is so sweet. l'm sorry.

38:56.244 --> 39:01.285
- l scared you. l crossed the line.
- You scared me, but l'm on edge.

39:01.457 --> 39:05.157
- Sorry.
- Don't apologise. l'm the one ...

39:05.335 --> 39:09.036
l understand.

39:09.256 --> 39:12.340
l'm just gonna take a walk.

39:12.509 --> 39:16.376
Are you sure?

39:24.228 --> 39:29.934
l just really like you a lot.
l want you to have a great time.

39:30.110 --> 39:33.525
l want you to be happy.

39:44.623 --> 39:48.573
l'll just grab a few things here.

39:51.045 --> 39:54.497
God, l'm sorry.

39:58.595 --> 40:01.714
Sorry.

40:10.647 --> 40:13.732
- Bounce, baby.
- You know what?

40:13.901 --> 40:18.609
l've decided
to change my major to finance.

40:18.780 --> 40:23.074
And l'm going to Wall Street.
You know why?

40:23.243 --> 40:27.904
Because it's the only way l can
afford a big-ass bed like this.

40:28.080 --> 40:32.374
Show me some love
on this big-ass bed.

40:32.543 --> 40:37.121
- Oh, a Jacuzzi.
- Come on, let's stay right here.

40:37.339 --> 40:45.050
l spent $1 00 on a bathing suit. You
can pull it off, but l'm wearing it.

40:45.222 --> 40:48.341
You didn't mention that earlier,
sexy thing.

41:49.241 --> 41:53.452
- You scared the shit out of me!
- You're living your life in fear.

41:53.620 --> 41:59.908
lt's time for manhood. There's
a kick-ass party on the mainland.

42:00.085 --> 42:04.996
l'm saying we take the boat
and get jiggy with it.

42:05.173 --> 42:11.092
l have to tie the boat. There's a
storm coming. Then l'm going to bed.

42:11.262 --> 42:14.713
- And that's it?
- That's all l got for today.

42:14.932 --> 42:19.724
- Take the bake elsewhere.
- All right ... Bullshit.

42:19.936 --> 42:24.563
You need to take a chill pill.

42:24.733 --> 42:29.275
- Have a good time, bro.
- l will, buddy.

42:37.912 --> 42:40.913
Titus!

42:43.167 --> 42:45.539
Oh, damn it.

42:45.712 --> 42:49.708
Very funny, asshole.

42:52.176 --> 42:55.759
Hey, give me a hand, would you?

43:24.040 --> 43:28.452
- Long distance.
- l need an international operator.

43:59.531 --> 44:02.485
Come on!

44:21.051 --> 44:23.922
Housekeeping.

44:37.568 --> 44:40.733
Housekeeping.

45:36.289 --> 45:41.366
- What, what, what?
- Have you seen my hair tie?

45:41.545 --> 45:46.621
l'm sorry, baby. l just
don't want to get my hair wet.

45:46.799 --> 45:51.794
l finally got you in this Jacuzzi.
Let's not talk about hair care.

45:51.971 --> 45:56.763
- Don't get feisty.
- lt's too late for all that.

45:56.976 --> 46:02.432
We're miles away from anybody.
So nobody can hear you scream.

46:02.648 --> 46:08.768
l used to be a lifeguard. And please
don't make me blow my whistle.

46:08.946 --> 46:15.482
l'd just hate
for you to blow ... your whistle.

46:20.290 --> 46:24.038
No water sports after midnight.
Hotel policy.

46:24.210 --> 46:29.750
- What's the policy on burning herb?
- You can't try it till you buy it.

46:32.509 --> 46:38.464
What's up? lt's all good.
Believe me, it is all good.

46:40.059 --> 46:43.225
Crazy freak.

46:47.107 --> 46:49.859
Now, where was l?

46:57.033 --> 47:00.816
- Hey, guys. lsn't this beautiful?
- Damn.

47:01.036 --> 47:05.164
1 0 people on this island,
and they all end up in this Jacuzzi.

47:05.332 --> 47:09.376
- How's the water?
- Crowded.

47:09.544 --> 47:14.835
- How's Julie doing?
- She's up in her room alone.

47:15.008 --> 47:19.634
- Any advise?
- Find another Jacuzzi.

47:19.804 --> 47:25.510
You can't give up so easy.
You've got to hang in there.

47:25.727 --> 47:28.762
lt's great, isn't it?

47:28.938 --> 47:33.267
l can't win. l can't ...

47:45.537 --> 47:48.288
Will?

49:05.821 --> 49:09.606
Where the hell's my toothbrush?

50:23.145 --> 50:26.347
- Hey, l know, l know ...
- Will!

50:26.564 --> 50:29.601
Will! lt's happening again.

50:31.361 --> 50:34.362
What happened?

50:39.243 --> 50:42.529
l do not find this at all funny.

50:42.747 --> 50:45.368
There was a body. l swear it.

50:45.541 --> 50:50.369
- Maybe you were dreaming.
- l wasn't.

50:50.546 --> 50:54.673
l knew you were gonna be trouble
the moment l laid eyes on you.

50:54.841 --> 50:59.717
- Listen to me. He's here.
- What's going on?

50:59.888 --> 51:04.715
Julie says she saw a dead guy in
the closet. All we see is bathrobes.

51:04.934 --> 51:10.854
You think this is funny? l'm not
going crazy. He was in there.

51:11.024 --> 51:15.068
Oh, yeah? Then where is he now?
Where's the dead guy?

51:15.277 --> 51:22.026
- What did you actually see?
- The dockhand hanging by his neck.

51:22.200 --> 51:30.030
Look, tomorrow we'll talk to Darick
and put this whole thing to rest.

51:30.209 --> 51:35.415
So let's slow down on the Dark
and Stormies and get some sleep.

51:35.630 --> 51:40.209
- l want off this island.
- That's not possible.

51:40.384 --> 51:44.631
The last ferry left hours ago,
and we have a storm coming.

51:44.805 --> 51:51.342
- l'll call the mainland for a boat.
- The phones just went down.

51:55.274 --> 51:58.109
lt's dead.

51:58.277 --> 52:03.781
Listen up. The next couple of days
will be rough, but we'll make it.

52:03.990 --> 52:07.276
- What about a radio?
- Emergencies only.

52:07.452 --> 52:12.612
You city kids wouldn't know
a hurricane if it blew up your ass.

52:16.211 --> 52:22.544
This is not a drill. All we can do
is batten down and ride it out.

52:22.716 --> 52:27.710
And if it gets really bad,
we have a storm shelter. Goodnight.

52:54.705 --> 52:59.782
Pain of the past, fear
of the future, blood of the young.

52:59.960 --> 53:06.045
Pain of the past, fear
of the future, blood of the young.

53:06.216 --> 53:10.759
Pain of the past,
fear of the future ...

53:10.929 --> 53:13.883
... blood of the young.

53:26.986 --> 53:34.530
Yeah, that's my babies.
You all growed up real good.

53:47.088 --> 53:54.218
Where are you hiding?
Come to Papa, come to Papa ...

53:54.386 --> 53:58.550
Yeah, that's it.

53:58.766 --> 54:01.303
Got to find that damn lighter ...

54:12.695 --> 54:16.444
Can l help you?

54:17.033 --> 54:20.402
Goddamn it!

54:23.789 --> 54:26.494
Oh, God ...

54:28.044 --> 54:33.085
What are you doing? No.
Seriously, don't do that.

54:36.343 --> 54:40.423
Oh, God ... Jesus, no!

54:40.597 --> 54:42.969
lt's all good!

55:07.998 --> 55:10.667
Can l help you?

55:20.218 --> 55:23.136
- That's a full carat.
- How much?

55:23.305 --> 55:27.432
- She's got some flaws in her.
- How much?

55:27.600 --> 55:32.642
l don't have much of a market
for this kind of thing.

55:32.855 --> 55:37.066
- 200. Maybe 250.
- Make it 300.

55:39.278 --> 55:42.279
And throw in that, too.

55:45.033 --> 55:50.110
Which one you talking about? You're
crazy. That's worth 300 by itself.

55:50.288 --> 55:55.828
- Then there's the waiting period.
- Keep the ring and give me the gun.

56:08.347 --> 56:12.095
- You sure you want to go this way?
- ls it loaded?

56:12.267 --> 56:14.840
- No.
- Load it.

56:27.866 --> 56:30.403
Get the hell off of me.

56:32.578 --> 56:38.533
Baby, this is bullshit. This ain't
the romantic weekend l had in mind.

56:38.751 --> 56:42.285
Hey, Jules, get any sleep?

56:42.462 --> 56:45.547
- Some.
- Look at that.

56:45.716 --> 56:51.753
Another beautiful day in paradise
with Julie as our tour director.

56:51.930 --> 56:57.434
- Do you see any fresh kill?
- Shut up, Ty.

56:57.602 --> 57:01.849
- How about a Freddie or Jason?
- Leave her alone, man.

57:02.023 --> 57:08.310
lt's bad enough getting rained out
without having to hold her hand.

57:08.487 --> 57:14.407
- Don't be an asshole about it.
- lt's okay. He doesn't believe me.

57:14.577 --> 57:20.946
- lt's his right. Maybe l am crazy.
- Nobody thinks you're crazy.

57:21.124 --> 57:24.410
- l do.
- Why don't you go do something?

57:24.628 --> 57:28.921
l don't want to do nothing with him.
l want to do something with you.

57:30.341 --> 57:36.461
Let's go to the gym and work off
some stress. You're not crazy.

57:42.269 --> 57:48.639
Look, we need to find stoner boy
and get pool sticks or something ...

57:48.817 --> 57:52.862
The greenhouse effect
has caused the Gulf Stream to shift.

57:53.030 --> 58:00.610
Experts expect a dramatic increase
of hurricanes, coastal flooding ...

58:00.829 --> 58:04.446
lt wouldn't take much
to wipe us off this island.

58:04.623 --> 58:07.328
Shut up, okay? Shut up.

58:07.501 --> 58:10.752
God!

58:12.382 --> 58:15.132
Come on!

58:18.303 --> 58:21.305
This is a nice gym.

58:26.645 --> 58:28.803
Nice move.

58:28.980 --> 58:33.309
l'm gonna give your fisherman some
of this and see how he likes it.

59:00.051 --> 59:03.634
Oh, poor baby.

59:03.805 --> 59:06.889
You know what? l got a better idea.

59:07.058 --> 59:10.224
You're not leaving this island
till you get a tan.

59:14.023 --> 59:18.980
- Wow. Cancer in a box.
- No, this is the safe sun.

59:19.152 --> 59:22.356
lt's better than
a day on the beach, girl.

59:25.200 --> 59:29.447
With a little photosynthesis
you'll feel like a new ...

59:29.621 --> 59:33.204
- House plant?
- Exactly. Bye.

01:00:14.372 --> 01:00:17.954
- Sure this is the way to the pool?
- There's his cart.

01:00:18.125 --> 01:00:21.744
The fucking idiot
left it in the rain.

01:00:57.037 --> 01:01:02.576
Dryer. "Gee, Karla,
that'll break the machine."

01:01:02.751 --> 01:01:06.962
Damn. How many pairs are in there?

01:01:20.392 --> 01:01:23.310
Hey, pool boy!

01:01:24.188 --> 01:01:27.023
Yo, Bob Marley!

01:01:27.191 --> 01:01:30.144
You in there or what?

01:02:03.434 --> 01:02:06.269
Karla?

01:02:09.773 --> 01:02:12.857
Karla?

01:02:40.093 --> 01:02:42.798
Come on!

01:02:55.858 --> 01:02:58.064
Tyrell!

01:02:59.153 --> 01:03:01.905
You guys, help me!

01:03:08.078 --> 01:03:10.403
Use this. Just smash it.

01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:17.917
Come on.

01:03:18.129 --> 01:03:23.633
l told you l'm not crazy. He's here.
We've got to call for help.

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:27.846
Man, this classifies
as a fucking emergency!

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:40.525
Hey, Brooks. Where the fuck you at?
We want off this fucking island.

01:03:40.692 --> 01:03:45.188
- Oh, shit.
- We've got to get the fuck out.

01:03:52.787 --> 01:03:55.622
Julie!

01:04:04.715 --> 01:04:09.376
- Where are the boats?
- They were cut loose.

01:04:09.553 --> 01:04:15.472
- Julie, what the fuck is going on?
- He's gonna kill us one by one.

01:04:15.642 --> 01:04:19.805
- Who?
- Ben Willis.

01:04:19.979 --> 01:04:25.685
- Willis is dead. You killed him.
- They never found the body.

01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:32.574
We lied. We hit him with our car
and threw his body in the water.

01:04:32.742 --> 01:04:37.035
Only he didn't die. Last Fourth
of July he killed Barry and Helen.

01:04:37.204 --> 01:04:40.787
l thought Ray and l killed him,
but we didn't.

01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:45.003
- He's back to finish it off!
- We're in the middle of nowhere.

01:04:45.212 --> 01:04:49.838
There's dead bodies piling up
and there's only one guy missing.

01:04:50.008 --> 01:04:54.800
- The porter. What's his name?
- Estes. The fucker knows something.

01:04:54.971 --> 01:04:59.680
We can sit here like assholes
or go find him first.

01:04:59.851 --> 01:05:03.931
- lt's not him.
- We have to do something.

01:05:05.689 --> 01:05:08.524
l'm with him.

01:05:09.485 --> 01:05:12.439
Come on.

01:05:12.613 --> 01:05:17.191
How can you not tell me the whole
story? l'm your best friend!

01:05:17.367 --> 01:05:23.121
- l didn't want to involve anybody.
- Well, it's too late for that now.

01:05:24.332 --> 01:05:28.033
Come on, let's go!

01:06:22.596 --> 01:06:24.306
Hey, Estes. You sick bastard,
are you in here?

01:06:24.306 --> 01:06:29.015
Hey, Estes. You sick bastard,
are you in here?

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:34.349
You hear me? Sick mother ...

01:06:35.817 --> 01:06:40.608
- He's not here, man.
- There's some crazy shit in here.

01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:53.076
No doubt.
This is our fucking killer.

01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:56.785
This is our fucking guy.

01:07:21.026 --> 01:07:23.398
You guys.

01:07:31.077 --> 01:07:33.747
Shit.

01:07:35.122 --> 01:07:38.123
Fuck.

01:07:43.465 --> 01:07:46.880
- Anyone missing a hair tie?
- Shit. That's mine.

01:07:49.762 --> 01:07:53.048
What about a toothbrush?

01:08:00.439 --> 01:08:03.771
Voodoo.

01:08:03.941 --> 01:08:09.814
We need flashlights, guns, whatever
we need to get off this island.

01:08:09.989 --> 01:08:15.825
- What if he's down there?
- Let's just get the fuck out.

01:08:17.287 --> 01:08:22.282
- You wait here.
- lt's safer up here.

01:08:22.459 --> 01:08:26.374
l'll just be a second.

01:08:44.564 --> 01:08:47.897
Julie, where are you going?

01:08:56.325 --> 01:08:58.814
What the hell was that?

01:08:58.993 --> 01:09:03.572
Shit. Julie?

01:09:35.446 --> 01:09:40.783
- Brazilia.
- Julie, watch out!

01:09:42.743 --> 01:09:47.488
That's the capital of Brazil.
Not Rio.

01:09:50.667 --> 01:09:55.128
No, guys! Leave him alone!

01:09:55.339 --> 01:09:59.586
- This is the killer.
- We've seen the voodoo stuff.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:05.429
l found the bodies this morning.
l tried the radio, it was destroyed.

01:10:05.598 --> 01:10:10.391
- Leave him alone. l believe him.
- l haven't hurt anyone.

01:10:10.562 --> 01:10:14.773
l stole those things to protect you.

01:10:14.941 --> 01:10:21.145
He could have killed me, but didn't.
We didn't answer the question right.

01:10:21.364 --> 01:10:25.990
This whole thing was a set-up.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil.

01:10:26.201 --> 01:10:28.574
Sorry. We lose.

01:10:28.746 --> 01:10:32.577
- So where's this Ben Willis guy?
- l don't know.

01:10:32.749 --> 01:10:39.001
You never know. How do we know
you didn't set this whole thing up?

01:10:39.214 --> 01:10:44.421
- How do we know you didn't?
- l know who you're talking about.

01:10:46.179 --> 01:10:53.593
He used to work here. l've seen
him by the orchard. l'll show you.

01:10:53.769 --> 01:10:59.475
- He could be setting us up.
- l'm not staying here.

01:10:59.650 --> 01:11:04.312
We're better off in the open. Maybe
we can kill this asshole for good.

01:11:06.573 --> 01:11:09.195
Show us.

01:11:26.801 --> 01:11:30.086
What the hell ..?

01:11:31.305 --> 01:11:35.255
- l need to get to Tower Bay lsland.
- We're closed.

01:11:35.434 --> 01:11:38.138
l need to get to that island now.

01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:44.480
Let me ask you, did you happen
to see what it's like outside?

01:11:44.651 --> 01:11:51.152
l'm not looking for a weather
report. So which boat is yours?

01:11:51.324 --> 01:11:54.740
He worked here for many years.

01:11:54.911 --> 01:11:58.445
Raised a family. Pretty wife.

01:11:58.622 --> 01:12:01.742
Two little ones. A boy and a girl.

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:05.002
One day the wife went missing.

01:12:05.171 --> 01:12:10.413
The maid found blood
all over the honeymoon suite. 201 .

01:12:10.634 --> 01:12:15.260
Eventually they found the body.
Pieces of it, at least.

01:12:15.471 --> 01:12:18.508
People say she was cheating on him.

01:12:18.683 --> 01:12:23.226
People say he would beat her.
People say a lot of things.

01:12:23.396 --> 01:12:28.603
He disappeared. Children, too.

01:12:28.776 --> 01:12:34.150
- Now he's back.
- Julie, be careful.

01:12:34.323 --> 01:12:37.822
l've got to see.

01:13:03.976 --> 01:13:09.137
- What's today's date?
- July fourth.

01:13:15.278 --> 01:13:22.324
l'm not gonna die on this island.
Do you hear me? l'm right here.

01:13:22.493 --> 01:13:27.321
- But my grave stays empty!
- This is crazy.

01:13:27.499 --> 01:13:32.837
- No phones, no boats, no way out.
- Yeah? Then we fight.

01:13:33.045 --> 01:13:36.877
- Where did Estes go?
- Why? He can't help us anyway.

01:13:37.049 --> 01:13:43.336
- Only he can. l'll find him.
- Are you gonna leave us here?

01:13:43.555 --> 01:13:49.593
- lt's okay. He can't have gone far.
- Meet us back at the hotel, okay?

01:13:49.769 --> 01:13:54.348
Okay? Come on, let's go.

01:14:21.091 --> 01:14:25.800
What l need is a gun, not a knife.
But fuck it.

01:14:28.014 --> 01:14:31.015
What are you gonna do with those?
Butter him?

01:14:31.184 --> 01:14:35.264
Clean vegetables? Take this.

01:14:36.939 --> 01:14:40.308
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:14:43.112 --> 01:14:47.026
Shit ... Hey, are you okay?

01:14:47.199 --> 01:14:50.200
We're gonna get this fucker, right?

01:14:50.369 --> 01:14:56.453
- Right? Let's head to the pantry.
- Why? ls that a good place to hide?

01:14:56.624 --> 01:15:00.207
l don't know.
l'm just fucking hungry.

01:15:01.838 --> 01:15:07.591
Estes, where did you go?
You said you were gonna help us.

01:15:10.179 --> 01:15:15.054
You should have told us
you had a boat.

01:15:15.225 --> 01:15:19.555
- We're not going anywhere.
- What?

01:15:29.990 --> 01:15:34.735
- Baby, don't go in here.
- lt's only food. Don't worry, baby.

01:15:41.166 --> 01:15:46.623
Stop trying to act
like you ain't hungry.

01:16:15.324 --> 01:16:18.609
lt's just a stupid rat.

01:16:18.785 --> 01:16:21.989
No, Nancy!

01:16:39.222 --> 01:16:44.513
Come in. Come in!
Come on ...

01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:50.016
The Arcadian requests emergency
assistance for Tower Bay lsland.

01:16:50.232 --> 01:16:54.894
l repeat, this is the Arcadian
requesting emergency assistance.

01:17:04.872 --> 01:17:08.999
So that's where
the flashlights were.

01:17:09.167 --> 01:17:13.959
- Sorry, but it could have been you.
- Or you, you crazy bitch.

01:17:14.130 --> 01:17:18.839
- You broke into my hiding place.
- Sorry, l missed the sign.

01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:24.050
This place didn't have a murder rate
till you people showed up.

01:17:28.227 --> 01:17:33.565
- l never saw a dead body before.
- Get used to it.

01:17:33.773 --> 01:17:37.225
- Who's doing this?
- Here we go.

01:17:37.444 --> 01:17:42.947
Don't get her started. lt's a long,
fucked-up story you won't believe.

01:17:43.115 --> 01:17:50.032
This is the worst vacation in my
life. l'm tired, hungry and horny.

01:17:50.206 --> 01:17:55.081
And personally, l haven't seen
one goddamn psycho killer.

01:18:08.265 --> 01:18:13.424
Come on! l know where we can hide.
Come on!

01:18:32.162 --> 01:18:35.247
Karla, come on!

01:18:50.972 --> 01:18:54.305
Karla!

01:18:57.561 --> 01:19:00.515
Shit ... lt won't lock!

01:19:04.193 --> 01:19:07.691
Follow me. Stay on the beams.

01:19:18.039 --> 01:19:20.708
Jesus Christ, that's my bedroom.

01:19:30.551 --> 01:19:33.718
Come on, give me your hand.
Come on!

01:19:33.888 --> 01:19:37.885
Come on ... Come on!

01:19:40.852 --> 01:19:44.351
You sick freak!

01:19:44.564 --> 01:19:47.399
Come on!

01:19:53.114 --> 01:19:56.530
Karla!

01:20:02.165 --> 01:20:04.619
Karla!

01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:08.161
Shit, shit ...

01:20:20.098 --> 01:20:24.724
- We've got to do something.
- She'll never make it. Come on.

01:20:24.936 --> 01:20:27.391
Get off me!

01:20:27.563 --> 01:20:29.936
Oh, shit.

01:20:34.069 --> 01:20:37.236
Oh, shit.

01:22:08.617 --> 01:22:12.117
Damn, it's locked.

01:22:13.205 --> 01:22:19.124
- Are you okay?
- l'll live. lt's locked.

01:22:19.294 --> 01:22:23.043
- We've got to open the door.
- We'll get you out. l promise.

01:22:28.928 --> 01:22:32.345
Karla!

01:22:36.477 --> 01:22:39.846
Shit ... Come on, Nancy.

01:22:50.074 --> 01:22:53.074
Come on, open the door.

01:22:54.494 --> 01:23:00.034
- l can't find it.
- Get out of the way.

01:23:01.417 --> 01:23:05.166
Get out of the way!

01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:14.385
Karla, come on!

01:23:27.109 --> 01:23:32.185
- Where are we going?
- The storm shelter!

01:23:41.747 --> 01:23:46.706
Don't worry. l know there's
emergency power here somewhere.

01:23:47.961 --> 01:23:52.089
- Hey, Julie?
- Just grab hold of my hand.

01:23:52.299 --> 01:23:57.044
- Just grab hold of my hand.
- l am holding your hand.

01:23:58.972 --> 01:24:02.257
No, you're not.

01:24:20.492 --> 01:24:23.493
- Are you okay?
- lt's Will!

01:24:23.662 --> 01:24:28.371
Come on, let's get out of here.
Come on.

01:24:34.256 --> 01:24:39.131
Everything is gonna be okay.
Just get inside. Estes attacked me.

01:24:39.344 --> 01:24:44.634
- You think he's a part of this?
- l don't know. Let's get inside.

01:24:44.848 --> 01:24:51.136
- l don't think we should go inside.
- The slicker guy was on the beach.

01:25:00.864 --> 01:25:04.067
Jesus, you're bleeding to death.
We need a first-aid kit.

01:25:04.242 --> 01:25:09.153
- l think there's one in the lobby.
- All right, just sit there.

01:25:09.372 --> 01:25:16.537
- Don't worry. He's gone. Just go.
- Look, l'll go with you. Come on.

01:25:18.381 --> 01:25:20.872
Listen, Will. You're gonna be okay.

01:25:21.050 --> 01:25:24.715
Jesus, there's blood everywhere.

01:25:27.514 --> 01:25:29.756
l can't find a wound.

01:25:29.934 --> 01:25:34.262
That's because it's not my blood.

01:25:35.313 --> 01:25:38.765
What?

01:25:39.651 --> 01:25:43.779
lt's not my blood, Julie.

01:25:59.211 --> 01:26:03.422
What's your favourite radio station?

01:26:08.010 --> 01:26:13.218
What's your favourite radio station?
96.7.

01:26:13.391 --> 01:26:17.554
lt's time for you to contemplate
the ultimate getaway.

01:26:31.784 --> 01:26:35.532
Here, take that. Come on ...

01:26:39.833 --> 01:26:42.750
Estes ...

01:26:43.503 --> 01:26:46.124
Fuck.

01:26:49.133 --> 01:26:51.126
Get off me!

01:26:51.302 --> 01:26:54.220
Get up ...

01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:59.179
God, no!

01:27:22.165 --> 01:27:25.948
We finally get to spend
some quality time together.

01:27:26.127 --> 01:27:29.994
- Why are you doing this to me?
- lt's always about you.

01:27:30.172 --> 01:27:35.842
"l have bad dreams. l can't sleep.
l have trouble with my boyfriend."

01:27:36.011 --> 01:27:42.594
You never take responsibility for
anything you do. Not even murder.

01:27:46.771 --> 01:27:51.479
What did you do that for?
You're a bitch.

01:27:54.236 --> 01:27:59.148
- That's gonna leave a mark.
- Tell me why.

01:27:59.325 --> 01:28:03.488
Come on, think. You'll get it.
Will Benson.

01:28:05.873 --> 01:28:09.159
Ben's son.

01:28:10.585 --> 01:28:13.076
Hi, Dad.

01:28:23.556 --> 01:28:30.223
Hush, now. No more screaming.
No more running. lt's time to die.

01:28:30.396 --> 01:28:34.607
Let her go ... Let her go.

01:28:34.775 --> 01:28:37.894
You've got to be shitting me!

01:28:38.069 --> 01:28:44.108
- What will you do? Call us names?
- Let her go now!

01:28:44.284 --> 01:28:48.577
Think about it, boy.
You're no killer. That's my job.

01:28:51.833 --> 01:28:55.878
You don't have it in you.

01:29:28.159 --> 01:29:34.742
Sure did miss you down here, Ray.
Too bad. We could have been friends.

01:29:34.915 --> 01:29:40.336
Really, man.
l would have shared her with you.

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:48.835
Come on, Ray. Stay with me.
You see that?

01:29:49.012 --> 01:29:53.839
l want you to think about all
the things we're gonna do to her.

01:29:57.145 --> 01:30:00.395
- You want him, Dad?
- Stand him up.

01:30:37.016 --> 01:30:40.930
Just ... fucking ... die!

01:31:43.621 --> 01:31:47.120
This is the Coast Guard.

01:31:47.291 --> 01:31:51.538
The rescue team

01:31:52.254 --> 01:31:54.579
Julie ...

01:31:58.927 --> 01:32:03.718
Karla ... God, l thought
l would never see you again.

01:32:03.889 --> 01:32:08.184
Girl, you don't have to worry
about me. l'm made of steel.

01:32:12.357 --> 01:32:17.065
- Good old Ray.
- Hey, Karla.

01:32:20.906 --> 01:32:25.366
lf anyone asks, let's not tell them

- Yeah.

01:33:14.123 --> 01:33:19.746

You didn't tell me how late it was.

01:33:21.714 --> 01:33:24.834

- You know me too well.

01:33:26.677 --> 01:33:30.804
Don't you dare go to sleep, girl.

01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:24.561
l love this thing.

01:35:24.455 --> 01:35:31.204
