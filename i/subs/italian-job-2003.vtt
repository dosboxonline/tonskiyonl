02:46.593 --> 02:47.719
Hello.

02:47.794 --> 02:49.785
Hello, sweetie.

02:49.863 --> 02:52.662
Daddy.

02:52.734 --> 02:53.995
It's early.

02:54.135 --> 02:55.658
Yeah, I know.

02:55.737 --> 02:58.297
I just wanted to let you know
I'm sending you something.

02:58.374 --> 03:01.001
Mmm. Does it smell nice?

03:01.078 --> 03:02.204
No,

03:02.279 --> 03:04.109
but it's sparkly.

03:05.182 --> 03:07.378
Does it have a receipt?

03:07.453 --> 03:11.320
I'm sending it
to you from the store.

03:13.559 --> 03:14.959
Why don't you just come by?

03:15.029 --> 03:16.689
We'll have some breakfast, hmm?

03:16.763 --> 03:19.198
Well, it'd be a long trip.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.736
I'm in Venice.

03:24.774 --> 03:27.174
With your parole officer's
approval, of course.

03:27.244 --> 03:29.509
Well, I like the guy, Stella,
you know that,

03:29.580 --> 03:31.639
but we never really connected.

03:31.716 --> 03:34.514
So I think I've paid
my P.O. his last visit.

03:34.586 --> 03:36.212
What are you into, Dad?

03:36.289 --> 03:37.416
Don't break my heart.

03:37.491 --> 03:39.082
You told me you were through.

03:39.159 --> 03:41.923
After this I am, I swear to you.

03:43.732 --> 03:45.427
Is Charlie there?

03:45.500 --> 03:47.195
I'm on a cell phone, darling.

03:47.270 --> 03:50.671
I'll call you tomorrow
from a land line.

03:50.740 --> 03:51.866
I love you.

03:51.941 --> 03:53.534
Go back to sleep. Bye.

03:53.611 --> 03:55.043
D... Dad?

04:00.219 --> 04:01.312
I love you, too.

04:08.061 --> 04:09.461
I sent it.

04:09.531 --> 04:11.088
You're supposed
to do your shopping

04:11.166 --> 04:12.394
after we pull off the job.

04:12.467 --> 04:13.628
I feel so optimistic.

04:13.703 --> 04:14.964
So?

04:15.038 --> 04:16.403
How do you feel?

04:16.473 --> 04:17.963
I'm fine.

04:18.041 --> 04:19.269
Fine?

04:19.343 --> 04:21.277
You know what "fine"
stands for, don't you?

04:21.346 --> 04:22.937
Yeah, unfortunately.

04:23.013 --> 04:24.174
"Freaked out."

04:24.250 --> 04:25.274
- "Insecure."
- "Neurotic."

04:25.351 --> 04:26.841
- And "Emotional."
- Good.

04:26.919 --> 04:29.080
See those columns behind you?

04:30.390 --> 04:31.949
What about them?

04:32.026 --> 04:34.290
That's where they used
to string up thieves

04:34.362 --> 04:35.294
who felt "fine."

04:35.364 --> 04:37.332
Well... after you.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.572
For after the haul.

04:47.612 --> 04:49.341
Hope I get to fire it up.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.006
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

04:51.084 --> 04:52.210
No.

04:52.285 --> 04:53.217
If they're no-shows,

04:53.286 --> 04:54.684
three months of prep
down the tubes

04:54.755 --> 04:56.723
and I dragged you out
of retirement for nothing.

04:56.791 --> 04:58.451
Oh, this is fun.
I like this.

04:58.526 --> 05:01.119
You've taken over the reins,
all the worries.

05:01.196 --> 05:03.721
Me loosey-goosey,
just along for the ride.

05:03.799 --> 05:05.323
I'm glad you're
enjoying yourself, John.

05:05.402 --> 05:06.494
Just remember, a police boat

05:06.570 --> 05:08.538
can get from the station
to our position in seven.

05:08.605 --> 05:10.506
That means you got
four minutes to work your magic.

05:10.576 --> 05:11.804
Now, you told me ten,

05:11.876 --> 05:13.741
and you said I would have five.

05:13.812 --> 05:15.540
When?

05:17.717 --> 05:20.481
Do not be messing
with me right now, okay?

05:20.554 --> 05:21.987
- I will kick your ass.
- Oh, yeah?

05:22.056 --> 05:23.317
Come on, take your best shot.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.323
Come on.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.722
What? Uh-oh.

05:36.408 --> 05:37.340
Come on.

05:37.409 --> 05:38.535
Let's go.

05:38.610 --> 05:40.008
What is it this time?

05:40.078 --> 05:41.444
Da Vinci. Architect.

05:41.515 --> 05:42.709
Engineer. Painter.

05:42.783 --> 05:44.011
Yeah, fascinating.

05:44.084 --> 05:45.210
Hey, look, look. Check this out.

05:45.285 --> 05:49.017
"Learn the language of poetry,
art, romance, sex."

05:50.426 --> 05:52.690
Unlike you, my friend,
I don't need a guidebook.

05:52.761 --> 05:54.023
Can we go? Please?

05:54.097 --> 05:56.531
Right, guv'nor.

05:56.599 --> 05:58.032
Come along,
make yourself useful.

05:58.102 --> 05:59.296
Untie that line.

05:59.371 --> 06:00.497
Today.

06:00.572 --> 06:01.630
Yeah.

06:01.706 --> 06:02.695
Yeah, Gilligan.

06:02.774 --> 06:03.832
If you don't mind.

06:42.090 --> 06:43.216
- We set?
- Yeah. I've enhanced

06:43.291 --> 06:45.522
the viewing matrix to track both
the Cartesian coordinates

06:45.596 --> 06:46.994
and three altitude angles,

06:47.063 --> 06:48.621
the yaw, pitch and roll
to give us

06:48.699 --> 06:50.256
the exact position and
orientation of our baby.

06:50.334 --> 06:51.302
We're in Italy.

06:51.369 --> 06:52.597
Speak English.

06:52.670 --> 06:54.365
Steve, how we looking?

06:54.440 --> 06:59.002
Papa took the boat to work at
8:15, so the garage is empty.

06:59.079 --> 07:03.414
Mama left with daughter
at 8:30 for preschool as usual.

07:03.484 --> 07:05.645
So for the next 45 minutes,

07:05.721 --> 07:07.450
we own this place, gentlemen.

07:07.523 --> 07:09.856
Still no word
from the garbagemen?

07:09.926 --> 07:11.985
Hey, who got you
the beekeepers in Budapest?

07:12.061 --> 07:13.119
They'll be there.

07:13.197 --> 07:14.562
You can trust these guys.

07:14.632 --> 07:16.998
Steve, how many times
do I have to tell you?

07:17.134 --> 07:21.503
I trust everyone... I just don't
trust the devil inside them.

08:09.735 --> 08:10.702
We're in.

08:28.092 --> 08:30.117
Just tell me where to paint.

08:38.136 --> 08:39.832
Your men are still not
in position?

08:39.905 --> 08:41.395
They will be.

08:41.475 --> 08:43.466
Well, you don't know that,
Steve. We should abort.

08:43.543 --> 08:47.343
I'm sorry, John, but I think
that's Charlie's call now.

08:51.888 --> 08:54.288
Our baby's being taken
out of here tonight.

08:54.357 --> 08:55.517
This is our only shot at it.

08:59.031 --> 09:00.225
Charlie?

09:01.867 --> 09:02.993
Keep going?

09:03.069 --> 09:05.003
It's up to you, kid.

09:05.138 --> 09:07.003
It's a go.

09:10.812 --> 09:11.780
Okay, Steve.

09:13.581 --> 09:17.779
From the west wall,
measure 14 feet, eight inches.

09:17.853 --> 09:19.014
Got it.

09:19.090 --> 09:20.784
Now measure
eight feet, five inches

09:20.858 --> 09:22.416
from the north wall.

09:22.493 --> 09:24.187
That's the northwest corner
of our baby.

09:25.564 --> 09:26.588
Got it.

09:26.666 --> 09:27.690
Well, it's right above you.

10:01.009 --> 10:02.067
Now, paint.

10:02.211 --> 10:05.477
Two feet, nine inches wide.

10:05.548 --> 10:07.641
Two feet, five inches deep.

10:07.717 --> 10:09.912
Okay, Left Ear.
You're up.

10:11.321 --> 10:13.655
14 feet four inches
from that west wall.

10:39.558 --> 10:40.922
Yeah.

10:43.162 --> 10:44.094
Bene.

10:45.398 --> 10:47.890
The garbagemen
are in position, John.

12:50.891 --> 12:52.414
All right, Charlie,
someone just called it in.

12:52.492 --> 12:55.154
The police boat's
heading your way.

12:55.262 --> 12:56.820
Seven minutes and counting.

12:56.899 --> 12:58.195
Let's go.

14:18.034 --> 14:20.866
We got four minutes
to load and leave. Let's go.

14:55.782 --> 14:56.806
Whoa! Whoa!

17:31.646 --> 17:33.135
Hey, you guys. Come here.

17:36.919 --> 17:39.580
I want to propose a toast.

17:39.655 --> 17:41.589
To us.

17:41.658 --> 17:42.625
Yay!

17:45.997 --> 17:48.591
And I want to propose
a toast to Charlie

17:48.667 --> 17:52.069
because we just stole
$35 million worth of gold

17:52.138 --> 17:54.038
without even holding a gun

17:54.108 --> 17:55.734
because he planned this
down to a "T."

17:55.809 --> 17:58.040
Nobody else
could have done that.

17:58.113 --> 17:59.137
Nobody. Charlie!

17:59.214 --> 18:00.943
- Charlie!
- Yay!

18:01.016 --> 18:02.745
Thank you.

18:02.819 --> 18:04.047
So, come on, gentlemen.

18:04.120 --> 18:05.849
Shopping list.
Who's doing what?

18:05.922 --> 18:07.151
Spare no dirty details.

18:07.257 --> 18:08.553
Come on, you guys.

18:08.625 --> 18:10.821
Take a lesson from an old man.

18:10.895 --> 18:12.623
Don't spend it.
Invest.

18:14.133 --> 18:15.430
In what?

18:15.502 --> 18:17.367
In gold.

18:19.374 --> 18:20.704
Let's figure out

18:20.774 --> 18:22.902
how to get out of here first,
all right?

18:22.978 --> 18:25.037
What are you getting, Rob?

18:25.114 --> 18:26.410
I don't know...
there's a lot of things

18:26.482 --> 18:27.574
you can buy with a lot of money.

18:27.649 --> 18:29.378
You know, I'm just thinking
about naked girls

18:29.452 --> 18:30.613
in leather seats.

18:30.688 --> 18:32.178
Obviously. See?

18:32.256 --> 18:34.417
Suppose I get
the Aston Martin Vanquish?

18:34.493 --> 18:35.754
There's not a lot
a girl won't do

18:35.826 --> 18:37.851
on the passenger seat
of one of those things.

18:37.929 --> 18:39.598
I'm going to get a NAD T770

18:39.699 --> 18:42.496
digital decoder with a 70-watt
amp and Burr Brown DACs.

18:43.569 --> 18:44.433
Yeah.

18:44.505 --> 18:45.597
It's a big stereo.

18:45.672 --> 18:47.868
Speakers so loud they blow
women's clothes off.

18:47.942 --> 18:49.102
Now you're talking.

18:50.713 --> 18:53.204
$35 million... you can't get
more creative than that, man?

18:53.348 --> 18:55.442
I'm going to Andalucia,
south of Spain...

18:55.519 --> 18:56.986
right there.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.610
Get me a big house...

18:58.688 --> 19:00.315
get me a library
full of first editions.

19:00.391 --> 19:01.688
Get a room for my shoes.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.728
What about you, Steve?

19:03.796 --> 19:06.162
I don't know...
I haven't decided yet.

19:06.298 --> 19:08.027
You haven't decided yet?

19:08.101 --> 19:09.967
Come on, man,
is it the mountain air, just...?

19:10.037 --> 19:10.969
I liked what you said.

19:11.038 --> 19:12.504
I'll take one of each of yours.

19:14.209 --> 19:15.800
Well, well, two of everything

19:15.876 --> 19:17.310
- For Steve then.
- Two of those.

19:17.380 --> 19:18.404
Oy!

19:23.720 --> 19:25.483
Loved the toast.

19:25.558 --> 19:27.753
But you could've pulled this off
with your eyes closed.

19:27.827 --> 19:30.159
No, you were incredible.

19:30.229 --> 19:31.661
Just incredible.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.164
You saw the whole picture.

19:33.234 --> 19:34.495
You covered all the angles.

19:35.570 --> 19:37.333
You know, Charlie,

19:37.405 --> 19:40.500
there are two kinds of thieves
in this world:

19:40.577 --> 19:43.170
the ones who steal
to enrich their lives,

19:43.246 --> 19:47.182
and the ones who steal
to define their lives.

19:47.250 --> 19:49.185
Don't be the latter.

19:49.254 --> 19:51.347
Makes you miss out
on what's really important

19:51.423 --> 19:53.185
in this life.

19:53.258 --> 19:55.693
What are you talking about,
John?

19:55.762 --> 19:57.194
You've been a good father.

19:57.263 --> 20:00.859
Sitting in prisons
doesn't make you a good father.

20:00.934 --> 20:03.458
I spent half my kid's life
in prison.

20:03.538 --> 20:07.474
Don't get to be my age
with nothing but this, Charlie.

20:07.543 --> 20:11.537
Find somebody you want to spend
the rest of your life with

20:11.616 --> 20:13.675
and hold onto her forever.

20:13.751 --> 20:16.776
- Okay?
- Hey.

20:16.855 --> 20:18.879
Let's go...
I'm freezing my ass off.

20:18.957 --> 20:21.222
Yeah.

20:21.294 --> 20:23.228
Steve's getting cold.

20:23.297 --> 20:24.729
You, too?

20:24.797 --> 20:25.889
I'm all right.

20:27.301 --> 20:28.563
I love you, kid.

20:28.637 --> 20:30.035
You did really great.

20:30.105 --> 20:32.573
Thanks, John.

20:32.641 --> 20:36.044
Let's go.

20:44.256 --> 20:47.419
Money

20:47.493 --> 20:50.053
It's a gas

20:50.131 --> 20:57.299
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

20:57.439 --> 21:00.841
New car, caviar,
four-star daydream...

21:00.911 --> 21:02.707
You should've seen Rob
behind the wheel of that boat.

21:02.780 --> 21:04.406
He was like Don Johnson.

21:04.481 --> 21:06.507
Oy, yeah, from Brixton.

21:06.585 --> 21:08.678
Yeah, what the hell do you know
about Brixton, eh?

21:14.861 --> 21:17.728
Look at this idiot
right in the middle of the road.

21:17.799 --> 21:19.322
What's this, what's this?

21:22.338 --> 21:24.306
Who the hell are these guys?

21:28.111 --> 21:28.770
Hey!

21:28.845 --> 21:29.938
Take your hands off the wheel.

21:30.014 --> 21:30.673
Steve!

21:34.052 --> 21:35.986
Don't even think about it...
just do it.

21:41.362 --> 21:42.225
No, no, no, no,

21:42.297 --> 21:43.491
- No, no, no, no, John.
- Steve,

21:43.565 --> 21:44.498
what the hell are you doing?

21:44.567 --> 21:45.931
Made a few plans of my own.

21:49.205 --> 21:51.605
There's nowhere you can go
where we won't find you, Steve.

21:51.674 --> 21:52.607
You know that.

21:52.676 --> 21:53.904
I think that's probably right,
John.

21:55.046 --> 21:55.511
Go! Go!

23:39.879 --> 23:42.940
Charlie.

23:43.016 --> 23:45.984
We got to go, Charlie.

25:09.826 --> 25:11.486
You always work in the dark?

25:11.561 --> 25:14.223
Makes me feel like I'm alone.

25:16.600 --> 25:17.532
Not bad.

25:17.602 --> 25:19.297
Not bad, Stella.

25:19.404 --> 25:21.132
Damn. Hurley couldn't
crack that safe.

25:21.207 --> 25:22.436
Neither could Spears.
Now you know

25:22.509 --> 25:23.441
who to call first.

25:23.510 --> 25:24.477
You're expensive, Stella.

25:24.544 --> 25:27.307
Those guys cut us a break
on subpoena jobs.

25:27.447 --> 25:29.108
Good will, community service.

25:29.182 --> 25:31.276
I do it for the money, Paul.

25:31.353 --> 25:32.842
I'll be sending you a bill.

25:32.922 --> 25:34.718
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

25:34.790 --> 25:35.814
I never look inside.

25:36.859 --> 25:38.487
Have a good day.
Hey, George.

25:38.562 --> 25:39.586
Hi, Stella.

25:39.664 --> 25:42.565
I came, I saw, I kicked some ass

25:42.634 --> 25:45.798
The pain I cause,
it makes me laugh

25:45.872 --> 25:47.532
'Cause the way I do my thing
is strange

25:47.607 --> 25:50.303
Time, time for this girl
to sing

25:50.376 --> 25:53.106
Damn if I thought
that you would change

25:53.181 --> 25:55.342
And my life would stay
the same

25:55.450 --> 25:57.816
Things will come
and things will go

25:57.886 --> 26:00.218
And one thing I know
for sure

26:00.288 --> 26:04.248
Is that the wreckoning,
the wreckoning, the wreckoning

26:04.328 --> 26:05.919
I'm walking out the door

26:05.997 --> 26:09.229
Wreckoning, the wreckoning,
the wreckoning

26:09.301 --> 26:11.063
Oh, it's time...

26:14.574 --> 26:15.505
How long to crack it?

26:15.574 --> 26:17.976
Four minutes and 43 seconds.

26:18.045 --> 26:18.977
Oh! You're the man.

26:19.047 --> 26:20.036
What's on the lineup?

26:20.115 --> 26:21.241
Todd Milliken called.

26:21.316 --> 26:22.839
He has a prototype
combination lock.

26:22.917 --> 26:24.249
He wants you to test out.

26:24.320 --> 26:25.446
He says he added

26:25.521 --> 26:28.490
two false contact points
on the tumbler.

26:28.559 --> 26:30.321
I'll pretend to be stumped
for a couple of seconds,

26:30.460 --> 26:31.518
give him a thrill.

26:31.594 --> 26:33.826
And, there's a Charlie Croker
in your office.

26:35.001 --> 26:37.128
Says you two know each other.

26:40.073 --> 26:42.940
Charlie Croker.

26:43.010 --> 26:44.534
Hey, Stella.

26:47.549 --> 26:49.540
Didn't I tell you I never
want to see you again?

26:50.954 --> 26:53.184
I think it was when you told me
how my father died,

26:53.256 --> 26:54.688
right in front of your eyes,

26:54.758 --> 26:56.624
after you pulled him
in for one last job.

27:01.567 --> 27:03.057
We found him, Stella.

27:03.136 --> 27:05.866
He's in Los Angeles.

27:05.939 --> 27:06.997
The gold bricks he stole from us

27:07.074 --> 27:08.404
had a Balinese dancer
stamped on them.

27:08.475 --> 27:09.703
I just got word,

27:09.777 --> 27:11.143
from a contact of mine
called Skinny Pete,

27:11.213 --> 27:13.545
that a gold dealer out in L.A.
has been buying those bricks.

27:13.616 --> 27:15.242
Yeah?

27:15.317 --> 27:16.682
Well, how do you know it's him?

27:17.987 --> 27:20.479
Skinny Pete sent me this.

27:20.557 --> 27:22.718
Steve changed his last
name to Frazelli.

27:28.835 --> 27:30.700
Why you telling me
all of this?

27:30.770 --> 27:32.965
Been checking out the databases
behind safe companies.

27:33.039 --> 27:34.597
Found out Steve
had a Worthington 1000

27:34.676 --> 27:36.108
delivered to his home office.

27:36.178 --> 27:37.610
You don't install
a Worthington 1000

27:37.679 --> 27:39.271
unless you've got something
really big to guard.

27:39.347 --> 27:40.336
No, you don't.

27:40.450 --> 27:41.348
The problem now is no one

27:41.451 --> 27:42.680
in my crew
can handle Steve's safe.

27:42.753 --> 27:44.846
And I need somebody
I can trust.

27:44.922 --> 27:46.514
Look, I'm a professional
safe and vault technician.

27:46.591 --> 27:47.852
I'm not a thief.

27:47.926 --> 27:49.792
Hey, it's not about the gold,
Stella, okay?

27:49.862 --> 27:51.090
John was like a father
to me, too.

27:56.802 --> 27:58.064
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

27:58.139 --> 28:00.072
I just can't move on until
I've set things right.

28:06.282 --> 28:07.714
I've moved on.

29:12.399 --> 29:13.525
Come on, Charlie.

29:14.601 --> 29:15.626
Come on.

29:21.578 --> 29:22.840
Hello?

29:22.913 --> 29:24.778
I want to see the look
on that man's face

29:24.848 --> 29:26.178
when his gold is gone.

29:26.250 --> 29:29.413
He took my father from me;
I'm taking this.

29:33.960 --> 29:34.892
She's in.

29:34.961 --> 29:36.588
That's a good thing?

29:36.663 --> 29:37.721
It's a very good thing.

29:37.798 --> 29:39.664
She can crack a Worthington 1000
without even flinching.

29:39.734 --> 29:41.223
I'm not sure having
a civilian on the crew's

29:41.302 --> 29:42.360
a good idea, Charlie.

29:42.470 --> 29:43.368
She's got the skill

29:43.471 --> 29:44.563
and she's got the motivation.

29:44.639 --> 29:46.073
Exactly.

29:46.142 --> 29:47.370
She's emotional.

29:47.477 --> 29:49.672
You know what happens
when emotion gets into it.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.304
Look, don't kid yourself,
all right?

29:51.382 --> 29:52.780
We're all emotional on this one.

29:52.850 --> 29:55.081
Let's go.

29:55.153 --> 29:56.677
Are you ready?

29:56.756 --> 29:57.848
Of course I am.

30:00.460 --> 30:02.019
You're not ready.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.786
That was quick.

30:28.863 --> 30:29.921
Where are they?

30:29.997 --> 30:31.191
We're a little early.

30:31.265 --> 30:33.859
I didn't expect us to get here
quite that fast.

30:35.037 --> 30:36.095
There.

30:36.172 --> 30:37.230
That's Lyle.

30:37.307 --> 30:38.933
He's my computer genius.

30:43.480 --> 30:46.415
You know, he's who really
invented Napster.

30:46.484 --> 30:47.882
At least that's how
Lyle tells it.

30:47.953 --> 30:51.081
Said Shawn Fanning
was his roommate in college

30:51.158 --> 30:52.988
and stole his idea.

31:05.309 --> 31:07.902
Think it's his first time
riding that bike, though.

31:10.649 --> 31:11.617
Hey.

31:13.553 --> 31:14.679
Oh...

31:16.055 --> 31:17.351
You okay?

31:18.758 --> 31:20.192
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

31:21.262 --> 31:22.354
That's Left Ear.

31:22.997 --> 31:24.430
Demolition and explosives.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.432
When he was ten,

31:25.568 --> 31:27.399
he put one too many M-80s
in the toilet bowl.

31:27.471 --> 31:30.098
Fire...

31:30.173 --> 31:31.868
Whoa.

31:31.943 --> 31:33.035
Yeah, that was cool.

31:33.111 --> 31:34.305
How'd you do that?

31:34.379 --> 31:35.404
What?!

31:35.481 --> 31:36.777
How'd you do that?

31:36.849 --> 31:37.838
What?!

31:37.916 --> 31:40.283
I said,
how did you do that?

31:40.353 --> 31:42.720
What?!

31:42.790 --> 31:44.416
Lost the hearing
in his right ear.

31:44.493 --> 31:46.688
He's been blowing
stuff up ever since.

31:49.631 --> 31:51.327
Handsome Rob.

31:51.401 --> 31:52.459
Premier wheel man.

31:52.602 --> 31:53.932
Once drove all the way
from Los Angeles

31:54.003 --> 31:55.903
just so he could set the record
for longest freeway chase.

32:04.784 --> 32:06.980
- You're a heartbreaker...
- You know, he got 110

32:07.054 --> 32:08.418
Iove letters
sent to his jail cell

32:08.488 --> 32:10.079
from women
who saw him on the news?

32:10.158 --> 32:12.319
You're a heartbreaker

32:12.393 --> 32:13.883
Dream-maker

32:13.962 --> 32:14.894
Love-taker

32:14.963 --> 32:16.988
Don't you mess around,
no, no, no...

32:21.907 --> 32:23.168
And you?

32:23.241 --> 32:25.732
I never heard
how you got your start.

32:25.811 --> 32:27.938
Me?

32:28.013 --> 32:30.710
Well, I've been a thief
since I had baby teeth.

32:30.784 --> 32:33.844
Okay, you both know what to do.

32:33.921 --> 32:35.319
Cough it up, now!

32:35.389 --> 32:39.258
Come on, now,
shake it, shake it, baby, ho!

32:39.328 --> 32:41.262
One, two, three, baby...

32:42.131 --> 32:43.292
Watch it, spaz!

32:43.366 --> 32:45.061
Hey, now, do, re, me, baby...

32:45.135 --> 32:46.102
Hey, what's your problem, man?

32:46.169 --> 32:48.638
A-B-C, it's easy

32:48.706 --> 32:50.468
As one, two, three...

32:51.542 --> 32:52.475
Hey, Charlie.

32:52.544 --> 32:53.670
Good to see you, man.

32:53.745 --> 32:54.939
- Looking good.
- Yeah?

32:55.014 --> 32:57.414
- Charlie Hustle.
- Good to see you.

32:57.484 --> 32:58.416
Hello, Charlie.

32:58.486 --> 33:00.077
Rob, what's up?
Good?

33:00.153 --> 33:01.644
Guys...

33:01.723 --> 33:02.815
Stella Bridger.

33:02.891 --> 33:05.121
Hi.

33:05.193 --> 33:06.125
How you doing?

33:06.194 --> 33:07.320
Nice to meet you.

33:07.395 --> 33:08.420
Phones?

33:08.532 --> 33:09.692
Yeah, they're all
fresh and clean,

33:09.766 --> 33:11.199
I got internal chips in them.

33:11.268 --> 33:12.360
Please change them twice a day.

33:12.436 --> 33:14.164
We will get heat on line.

33:14.239 --> 33:15.433
I.D. s?

33:17.977 --> 33:19.307
"James Hymen?"

33:19.378 --> 33:21.608
Come on, man, one time,
give me a cool name.

33:21.681 --> 33:23.843
140 pounds? Try 165.

33:23.918 --> 33:25.179
Try lifting some weights.

33:25.253 --> 33:26.685
- Try lifting up these.
- Guys, enough.

33:26.754 --> 33:28.187
Come on, we leave
tomorrow, all right?

33:28.257 --> 33:29.189
Let's go.

33:29.258 --> 33:30.350
Hey, Charlie...

33:31.661 --> 33:33.458
Handsome, can you help
him with the bike?

33:33.531 --> 33:36.728
Yeah, help Knievel set up
for his next jump.

33:38.168 --> 33:40.330
Like a sound you hear
that lingers in your ear

33:40.405 --> 33:45.001
But you can't forget,
from sundown to sunset

33:45.076 --> 33:47.910
No, no

33:47.981 --> 33:50.472
It puts a brand-new kind
of thinkin' in your mind

33:50.618 --> 33:51.914
And you can't go wrong

33:51.986 --> 33:56.720
'Cause you're groovin'
all day long, ha-ha!

33:56.792 --> 33:59.284
California soul

33:59.362 --> 34:02.023
Ooh-ooh-ooh

34:02.098 --> 34:06.092
California soul...

34:06.170 --> 34:08.831
Man, out of all of the places
for a thief to hide,

34:08.907 --> 34:10.568
this joker picked Hollywood.

34:10.643 --> 34:12.907
He's a punk,
but he ain't stupid.

34:12.980 --> 34:14.446
All right...

34:14.581 --> 34:16.311
we need to figure out a way
to get in Steve's house

34:16.382 --> 34:18.112
and make a video blueprint
of the interior.

34:18.186 --> 34:20.313
I want audio surveillance
on his phone.

34:20.388 --> 34:21.878
Oh, yeah, I been wanting
to try something.

34:21.958 --> 34:23.389
I crack into the phone company's

34:23.458 --> 34:25.222
remote monitoring system,
and fool it into thinking

34:25.293 --> 34:26.319
there's a legal tap on the line.

34:26.396 --> 34:27.362
Just reroute the digital copies

34:27.431 --> 34:28.897
of the calls to our own
listening post.

34:28.967 --> 34:30.331
I been doing it
to my ex for years.

34:30.400 --> 34:31.867
How long?

34:31.936 --> 34:33.563
No... how long will it take?

34:33.639 --> 34:35.163
Not how long have you
been doing it to your ex.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.969
I'll burn through the night;
I'll have it running by morning.

34:39.914 --> 34:41.175
Sorry I'm late.

34:41.248 --> 34:43.045
We got to work on getting
Steve out of the house.

34:43.118 --> 34:44.777
Stella, how much time you need
with the Worthington?

34:44.853 --> 34:47.322
Five minutes flat.

34:47.389 --> 34:48.856
Don't be cocky, young lady.

34:48.924 --> 34:51.052
It's not the same as opening
a safe for the police.

34:52.429 --> 34:54.056
The perspiration
on your fingertips,

34:54.130 --> 34:55.597
your heart's pounding
in your ears...

34:55.667 --> 34:56.725
whole different ball game.

34:58.337 --> 35:00.271
I appreciate your concern.
I'll be fine.

35:01.974 --> 35:03.135
Look, just remember,

35:03.210 --> 35:04.268
this is all the easy part, okay?

35:04.344 --> 35:05.606
It's the getaway
that can get us caught.

35:05.680 --> 35:06.806
So what's the sketch?

35:06.881 --> 35:07.905
We drive to Union Station.

35:07.982 --> 35:10.780
Getaway car goes
right onto the train with us.

35:10.853 --> 35:12.445
We need to know exactly
how long it's going to take

35:12.588 --> 35:14.579
to get from Steve's house
to Union Station.

35:44.997 --> 35:46.793
Oh, great.

35:46.864 --> 35:48.195
Carson Security System.

35:48.267 --> 35:50.132
How good is it?

35:50.202 --> 35:51.863
Carson's held
an annual contest...

35:51.938 --> 35:54.498
$50,000 to anybody
that can bypass the system.

35:54.642 --> 35:57.076
The Who's Who of ex-cons
always show up.

35:57.144 --> 36:00.308
Five years running,
no one's been paid.

36:00.382 --> 36:02.976
Okay, party people,
here's the status.

36:03.052 --> 36:04.348
It's an anti-scaling fence.

36:04.420 --> 36:06.388
It's hardened,
electro-plated steel.

36:06.456 --> 36:08.448
Yeah, I'm going
to have to paint that up

36:08.526 --> 36:09.618
with some nitromin.

36:09.694 --> 36:10.955
Security on the property?

36:11.029 --> 36:12.393
Got an armed guard here.

36:12.464 --> 36:13.453
Little rent-a-cop,

36:13.531 --> 36:14.965
with a nine-millimeter
on his hip.

36:15.035 --> 36:16.433
But that booth...

36:16.502 --> 36:19.437
Security booth looks prime
for a chemical grenade.

36:19.506 --> 36:20.870
Nitromin, chemical grenades...

36:20.941 --> 36:23.069
I mean, that stuff's
pretty hard to come by.

36:23.144 --> 36:24.941
Yeah, Lyle, it's a bear market.

36:26.815 --> 36:28.475
Shit.

36:29.987 --> 36:31.283
This dude got dogs.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.152
I don't do dogs.

36:33.224 --> 36:35.715
I had a...
real bad experience, man.

36:35.793 --> 36:37.054
What happened?

36:37.129 --> 36:40.327
I had a bad experience.

36:40.399 --> 36:42.127
Damn it. I'm deaf.

36:57.254 --> 36:58.516
You turn in your badge

36:58.656 --> 37:00.681
and your weap...
Oh, shoot.

37:00.758 --> 37:03.057
Turn in your badge
and your weapon!

37:04.129 --> 37:05.061
Crush.

37:05.131 --> 37:06.120
I don't want to see you

37:06.199 --> 37:08.394
anywhere near
this investigation.

37:08.468 --> 37:11.302
And turn in
your badge and your weapon.

37:11.373 --> 37:12.304
I don't want to see you

37:12.374 --> 37:13.931
anywhere near
this investigation.

37:16.311 --> 37:18.337
Hey! It's a green!

37:18.414 --> 37:20.974
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

37:21.051 --> 37:22.847
- Green!
- I don't want to see you

37:22.919 --> 37:23.647
anywhere near this...

37:25.023 --> 37:26.252
Turn in your badge
and your weapon.

37:28.993 --> 37:31.791
Unbelievable.

37:43.446 --> 37:45.413
There he is.

38:04.205 --> 38:06.833
Let's get to work.

38:09.211 --> 38:13.308
It's either bad traffic,
peak traffic,

38:13.384 --> 38:14.816
slit-your-wrist traffic.

38:14.886 --> 38:17.116
You know, five people died
from smoking

38:17.188 --> 38:18.484
in between traffic lights today.

38:18.557 --> 38:20.491
You know, they do have
the Metrorail, Rob.

38:20.559 --> 38:21.856
You could always use that.

38:21.928 --> 38:23.054
That'd be ideal

38:23.129 --> 38:25.063
for carrying a ton of gold,
wouldn't it, genius?

38:26.100 --> 38:27.261
What's your guesstimate?

38:27.335 --> 38:29.826
The last 20 times
I've done the journey,

38:29.905 --> 38:32.999
you've got an average of 32
minutes and a top time of 50,

38:33.074 --> 38:35.009
but if we had green
lights all the way,

38:35.078 --> 38:36.669
we could do it in 14 minutes.

38:36.747 --> 38:38.908
Wait, you couldn't get
through traffic?

38:42.288 --> 38:43.186
Whoa.

38:44.657 --> 38:48.024
We could do anything
with green lights all the way.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.959
Lyle?

38:50.031 --> 38:51.862
Lyle?

38:53.267 --> 38:54.756
I'll see what I can do.

38:59.109 --> 39:01.076
You're right on time.

39:06.351 --> 39:08.148
All these poor bastards
out there,

39:08.219 --> 39:09.982
putting their life
savings in banks,

39:10.056 --> 39:11.990
and S&Ls, and mutual funds.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.323
How do they think,
when the collapse comes,

39:14.394 --> 39:16.156
they can depend
on the government?

39:16.230 --> 39:17.491
I don't think so.

39:17.598 --> 39:18.928
Are you taping me?

39:19.000 --> 39:20.661
Of course not.

39:20.735 --> 39:22.396
I never tape you...
come look,

39:22.471 --> 39:23.563
see for yourself.

39:26.076 --> 39:29.171
Governments are nothing more
than puppets and strings

39:29.246 --> 39:32.738
in a world where NAFTA
can overrule the Supreme Court.

39:33.819 --> 39:34.911
Like my cousin Mashkov

39:34.987 --> 39:38.082
always says: "This
is our only refuge, baby...

39:38.157 --> 39:41.149
gold."

39:47.269 --> 39:50.363
Every time I look
at these engravings...

39:50.440 --> 39:53.204
She's so beautiful.

39:53.276 --> 39:55.369
Where'd you say you got these?

39:55.446 --> 39:56.572
I didn't.

40:02.956 --> 40:04.480
A little walking around money.

40:14.736 --> 40:16.705
I guess I'm not walking
as far as I thought.

40:16.774 --> 40:17.741
I'm... sorry.

40:17.808 --> 40:19.275
I can only buy two bricks
from you today.

40:19.343 --> 40:21.242
- That wasn't the agreement.
- What can I say?

40:21.311 --> 40:22.573
I'm just middleman.

40:22.647 --> 40:24.912
I'll buy the other two
from you on Wednesday.

40:24.984 --> 40:26.450
Don't waste my time, Yevhen.

40:37.633 --> 40:38.601
So, what does a man

40:38.735 --> 40:41.636
with 35 million dollars worth
of gold do at night?

40:44.340 --> 40:46.900
He watches his big-ass TV.

40:49.347 --> 40:51.474
That's our in.

41:14.179 --> 41:15.111
Stella.

41:15.180 --> 41:17.080
Jesus!

41:17.149 --> 41:18.912
Charlie!

41:18.986 --> 41:20.418
How did you get in here?

41:20.488 --> 41:21.954
I knocked,
but you didn't answer.

41:22.021 --> 41:24.456
What... so you just
let yourself in?

41:24.525 --> 41:25.754
I was just making sure
you were okay.

41:25.827 --> 41:27.123
I apologize. I just...

41:28.196 --> 41:30.027
- I...
- Don't look.

41:34.339 --> 41:35.669
Okay.

41:38.676 --> 41:40.074
You got a lot of stuff here.

41:40.145 --> 41:43.047
You know,
your dad was old school.

41:43.116 --> 41:45.016
Did the whole thing by touch.

41:45.085 --> 41:47.110
That worked for him;
this works for me.

41:47.187 --> 41:50.157
Technology guarantees speed
and accuracy, you know?

41:50.225 --> 41:52.716
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
in this business, Stella.

41:54.364 --> 41:56.298
Why the headphones?

41:56.367 --> 41:58.129
Just training myself.

41:58.202 --> 42:00.830
Ambient noises, you know,
just in case.

42:03.807 --> 42:05.503
What do you want, Charlie?

42:06.812 --> 42:08.404
We're going to knock out
Steve's cable,

42:08.481 --> 42:10.141
and we need to send in
a repairman.

42:10.216 --> 42:12.584
To get your video blueprint
of the interior.

42:12.720 --> 42:14.084
Yep.

42:14.155 --> 42:16.851
Only problem is
Steve thinks we're all dead.

42:19.161 --> 42:20.322
Except me.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.160
I'll do it, Charlie.

42:25.236 --> 42:28.673
I'm in all the way,
whatever it takes.

42:30.275 --> 42:31.207
All right.

42:31.276 --> 42:32.766
I'll set it up.

42:32.845 --> 42:33.937
Okay.

42:34.013 --> 42:35.503
Um... you, um...

42:35.583 --> 42:37.175
maybe want to get a drink
downstairs with me

42:37.251 --> 42:38.275
before I go back to my room?

42:40.854 --> 42:44.291
I sh... I should finish
this stuff up, you know?

42:44.360 --> 42:46.419
Just get it all done tonight.

42:46.495 --> 42:48.122
Yeah.

42:48.198 --> 42:49.358
Sorry I scared you.

42:49.433 --> 42:51.436
It's okay.

42:51.436 --> 42:51.501
|

42:51.502 --> 42:53.094
Good night.

42:54.173 --> 42:55.969
Bye.

42:56.040 --> 42:58.635
And then he's just...
the media darling.

42:58.712 --> 43:00.303
He's on the cover
of all the magazines.

43:00.380 --> 43:02.576
I should've been on the cover
of Wired Magazine.

43:02.717 --> 43:03.580
You know what he said?

43:03.718 --> 43:05.048
He said he...
he named it Napster

43:05.119 --> 43:06.348
because it-it was his nickname,

43:06.421 --> 43:08.412
'cause of the nappy hair
under the hat,

43:08.490 --> 43:10.583
but he... it's 'cause
I was napping

43:10.660 --> 43:12.594
when he stole it from me!

43:12.729 --> 43:15.254
He didn't even graduate.

43:15.332 --> 43:18.267
I think it's time to move on,
don't you?

43:18.336 --> 43:19.268
They shut him down.

43:19.337 --> 43:22.307
I wish they'd
do the same to you.

43:23.343 --> 43:24.503
Here... here we go.

43:24.578 --> 43:25.976
Cable chick.

43:37.560 --> 43:38.618
Becky.

43:38.695 --> 43:40.287
Nice name... I wonder
what she calls

43:40.364 --> 43:41.296
the other one.

43:41.365 --> 43:42.626
And it's such a mystery

43:42.700 --> 43:44.531
why you don't have
a girlfriend, Lyle.

43:45.605 --> 43:47.128
So, all we need is a...

43:47.205 --> 43:48.466
service truck like that one,

43:48.541 --> 43:50.531
a work shirt like hers.

43:51.611 --> 43:52.943
You think Stella
can pull it off?

43:53.014 --> 43:54.480
I have my doubts.

43:54.549 --> 43:56.676
There's no talking
to Charlie, though.

43:57.852 --> 44:00.651
You think he's...

44:00.724 --> 44:03.158
mixing business with pleasure?

44:03.226 --> 44:05.456
He should know better.

44:05.529 --> 44:07.156
Only I'm allowed to do that.

44:09.001 --> 44:11.594
Right. Where you going?

44:11.704 --> 44:13.968
To get a work shirt
and a service truck.

44:22.851 --> 44:24.716
Are you kidding me?

44:28.858 --> 44:30.917
How does he do that?

44:30.993 --> 44:31.961
How do you do that?

44:32.030 --> 44:33.258
What are you saying?

44:33.332 --> 44:34.764
Hey, how are you?

44:34.833 --> 44:36.231
Oh, good. I'm good.

44:36.301 --> 44:39.134
Nice to meet you,
I'm... Handsome Rob.

44:39.205 --> 44:40.536
And you are...?

44:40.607 --> 44:41.972
Oh, my name's...
my name's Becky,

44:42.043 --> 44:43.407
but it's written on my shirt.

44:43.478 --> 44:46.470
Listen, I'm going to need
your shirt... and your truck.

44:46.547 --> 44:48.037
Perfect.
I'll give them both to you.

44:48.117 --> 44:50.312
Would you... would you like
my virginity as well?

44:50.386 --> 44:51.876
If it's on the menu.

44:51.955 --> 44:53.478
Ha, ha, ha, ha,
oh, you're so witty.

44:53.555 --> 44:55.353
Why don't you
take advantage of me?

44:55.426 --> 44:57.326
Yeah, you're
not too bright, are you?

44:57.395 --> 44:58.327
No.

44:58.397 --> 44:59.591
Perfect.

46:45.766 --> 46:47.494
What can I do for you,
Mr. Frazelli?

46:47.567 --> 46:48.828
The cable's out.

46:48.902 --> 46:50.335
The TV, the modem, everything.

46:50.404 --> 46:52.669
Now, get somebody up here,
and tell them to hurry up.

46:58.481 --> 47:00.279
Netcom Cable,
how can I help you?

47:00.350 --> 47:02.750
Hi, I'm up at 3320 East Skyway,
and the cable's

47:02.819 --> 47:04.446
just gone out...
our modem, everything.

47:04.522 --> 47:06.114
Okay, um, let's see, sir.

47:06.191 --> 47:08.183
I have a Thursday
between 9:00 and 3:00

47:08.261 --> 47:09.353
if that would be good.

47:09.429 --> 47:10.952
That's going to work. Thank you.

47:11.031 --> 47:13.659
Guard just called
the cable company.

47:14.937 --> 47:17.064
What time's the appointment?

47:17.139 --> 47:19.073
Thursday between 9:00 and 3:00.

47:28.385 --> 47:29.317
Hello?

47:29.386 --> 47:30.752
Hi, I'm calling
from Netcom Cable.

47:30.823 --> 47:32.153
I understand your service
is out,

47:32.224 --> 47:33.919
and there was an appointment
set up for Thursday.

47:33.993 --> 47:34.925
Yes.

47:34.995 --> 47:36.256
Well, we have
a technician working

47:36.329 --> 47:37.886
in your area who's finished
with an appointment

47:37.965 --> 47:38.897
earlier than expected.

47:38.966 --> 47:40.490
Will somebody be there
for the next hour?

47:40.568 --> 47:41.829
Sure, that'd be great.

47:41.903 --> 47:44.303
All right, our technician
will see you then.

47:44.372 --> 47:45.339
Have a nice day.

47:46.743 --> 47:48.505
Here's all the paperwork
you need.

47:48.578 --> 47:51.513
Just get him to sign
and date at the bottom.

47:51.581 --> 47:54.050
Let's check out the camera.

47:56.388 --> 48:00.153
Stella,
you'll be going patriotic today.

48:02.229 --> 48:03.593
Make sure you walk slowly,

48:03.664 --> 48:05.097
or the image will streak.

48:05.165 --> 48:06.097
- Ow.
- Ooh.

48:06.167 --> 48:07.656
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

48:08.936 --> 48:10.427
Sorry... Couldn't pin

48:10.506 --> 48:11.972
the corsage
on my prom date either.

48:12.041 --> 48:12.973
But you had a prom date?

48:13.042 --> 48:15.169
It was his cousin.

48:15.244 --> 48:16.769
There's cable lines

48:16.848 --> 48:18.645
in the kitchen,
living room, bedroom,

48:18.717 --> 48:20.547
and the cable modem on
the computer in the office.

48:20.618 --> 48:23.019
You need to locate
the safe in the office.

48:25.059 --> 48:26.117
Okay.

48:26.193 --> 48:27.819
Just want you to know

48:27.894 --> 48:29.054
I think you're very
brave going in there.

48:29.129 --> 48:30.061
I know it won't be easy.

48:30.131 --> 48:31.894
I second that.

48:33.903 --> 48:35.631
It's going to be fine.

48:36.939 --> 48:38.496
What?

48:38.574 --> 48:40.566
You know what fine stands for?

48:40.644 --> 48:41.633
Freaked Out. Insecure...

48:41.712 --> 48:44.806
Neurotic, and Emotional.

48:49.623 --> 48:50.817
You'll be great.

48:50.891 --> 48:52.025
Yeah.

49:03.607 --> 49:04.971
Morning.

49:05.042 --> 49:06.270
Can I see some I.D.?

49:15.755 --> 49:17.950
Thanks for coming so soon.

49:18.024 --> 49:19.491
Hey, that's part of the job.

49:19.561 --> 49:21.050
All right.

49:51.868 --> 49:54.302
Aston Martin Vanquish.

49:54.370 --> 49:58.103
Looks like that bastard
took my car.

50:00.812 --> 50:03.576
Nasty-ass dogs.

50:03.649 --> 50:06.379
Hey! Hey!

50:12.260 --> 50:13.319
Relax,

50:13.395 --> 50:15.522
Jesus Christ.

50:15.597 --> 50:17.827
Come on,
they won't bother you now.

50:18.902 --> 50:21.030
Come on.

50:22.607 --> 50:24.233
House.

50:24.308 --> 50:26.276
Go on, get out of here.

50:31.318 --> 50:32.410
It's okay,

50:32.486 --> 50:35.147
I'm used to running into
all sorts of animals on my job.

50:38.561 --> 50:39.822
Steve Frazelli.

50:41.497 --> 50:42.896
Becky.

50:45.969 --> 50:47.903
Want to show me that problem?

50:47.971 --> 50:49.598
Yeah, of course.

50:49.674 --> 50:50.902
This way.

50:51.976 --> 50:53.774
You have a really nice house.

50:53.847 --> 50:56.111
Yeah. 1922.

50:56.182 --> 50:58.775
All the original tiles.

50:58.853 --> 51:00.445
Every stone in that courtyard

51:00.521 --> 51:03.251
hauled from some
monastery in Seville.

51:03.325 --> 51:04.723
What a tactic.

51:04.793 --> 51:06.089
Monastery?

51:06.161 --> 51:08.495
Monastery for punk-ass creeps.

51:08.565 --> 51:11.158
You don't seem impressed.

51:11.235 --> 51:13.567
No, it's just that I don't think
lugging a bunch of rocks

51:13.637 --> 51:16.232
from one place to another
is quite... that interesting.

51:16.308 --> 51:18.572
You know, it doesn't quite
do it for me.

51:18.644 --> 51:20.908
What does do it for you?

51:20.980 --> 51:24.246
Um... TVs?

51:24.317 --> 51:26.046
I have a monster TV.

51:27.121 --> 51:28.315
Not working right now, but...

51:28.389 --> 51:30.084
But you know, I should
probably check out

51:30.158 --> 51:31.750
the cable modem, you know.

51:31.860 --> 51:33.259
Yeah? Yeah, right.

51:33.329 --> 51:34.795
Over here.

51:36.866 --> 51:40.268
I paid 30 grand to some punk kid
to put this system in.

51:40.338 --> 51:41.771
One day, it just goes out.

51:41.840 --> 51:45.469
I ought to have him strung up.

51:48.315 --> 51:49.213
Here we go.

51:49.283 --> 51:50.250
There's our baby.

51:51.286 --> 51:52.775
We got him.

51:52.854 --> 51:54.686
Got any, uh, wiring
coming through here?

51:54.757 --> 51:56.314
There's no wiring in here.

51:59.528 --> 52:00.620
Just right here?

52:00.696 --> 52:01.628
Yeah.

52:01.698 --> 52:03.496
Look at that, that's my...

52:03.567 --> 52:05.398
That's my NAD T770.
That's...

52:05.470 --> 52:07.404
That's my stereo.

52:07.472 --> 52:08.961
I bet most of your customers

52:09.041 --> 52:11.272
are pretty surprised when
they go to open the door

52:11.344 --> 52:12.902
for the cable man
and find you standing there.

52:12.980 --> 52:14.174
Oh, yeah.

52:14.248 --> 52:16.113
He's hitting on her.

52:16.183 --> 52:17.275
There's no problem here.

52:17.351 --> 52:18.979
I should maybe
just check the TVs.

52:20.489 --> 52:22.320
Okay.

52:25.161 --> 52:26.595
You know what,
end this shit right now.

52:26.664 --> 52:27.596
I'm going to blow this shit

52:27.665 --> 52:29.097
right off the mountain
right now.

52:29.167 --> 52:31.135
No, no, no.
No, no, hey, hey, hey.

52:35.674 --> 52:37.574
I see you got the AVM processor.

52:37.644 --> 52:39.441
Only the best.

52:39.512 --> 52:41.481
Check the box.

52:46.922 --> 52:50.017
I'm just going to...
reset your system.

52:50.094 --> 52:53.961
Sometimes these things just get
jammed up you know?

52:54.031 --> 52:55.666
That should do it.

52:55.666 --> 52:55.732
|

52:55.733 --> 52:57.634
It's fixed?

52:57.703 --> 53:00.137
Turn her on, let's see.

53:00.206 --> 53:01.298
Now.

53:03.810 --> 53:05.368
Japan's Nikkei index...

53:05.446 --> 53:06.912
Perfect.

53:08.149 --> 53:09.241
...was the ending price

53:09.318 --> 53:11.080
and as you can see,
we've now gone below...

53:11.152 --> 53:13.588
Becky, huh?

53:13.656 --> 53:16.556
Have we met before?

53:16.627 --> 53:18.754
...a loss of 1.1 percent
on the...

53:18.829 --> 53:20.592
No, I don't think so.

53:20.664 --> 53:22.097
If you can just sign there.

53:23.502 --> 53:25.493
So, if I was to ask you
out to dinner...

53:25.571 --> 53:27.231
would I be the first
one of your customers

53:27.306 --> 53:28.433
to ever do that?

53:28.509 --> 53:31.535
What, you asked your last cable
repair guy out for a date?

53:31.613 --> 53:33.603
No, but the last one
was, like, 300 pounds,

53:33.681 --> 53:34.773
had a handlebar mustache.

53:34.849 --> 53:35.942
You know, not really my type.

53:36.018 --> 53:38.509
I don't think it's a good idea.

53:38.587 --> 53:40.782
Why, is that, like,
some, cable company rule?

53:40.923 --> 53:43.620
No, actually, it's just my rule.

53:43.694 --> 53:45.388
I don't go out
with strange men.

53:45.464 --> 53:48.398
I just met you five minutes ago.

53:48.466 --> 53:50.902
So, I guess I have to, like,
sabotage my cable, you know,

53:50.970 --> 53:52.800
till we get to know each other
well enough.

53:55.042 --> 53:56.565
Have a nice day.

53:56.644 --> 53:58.579
Come on,

53:58.647 --> 54:00.045
I'll be a perfect
gentleman, I promise.

54:00.115 --> 54:01.639
I won't even ask you
for your phone number.

54:01.717 --> 54:02.741
I'll just... I'll meet you.

54:02.819 --> 54:05.310
Anywhere you want to go.

54:05.388 --> 54:09.325
Come on, break your rule once.

54:10.395 --> 54:12.124
It's just dinner.

54:17.169 --> 54:19.661
Is that a yes?

54:29.686 --> 54:32.279
Are you okay?

54:32.355 --> 54:34.790
Yeah.

54:34.859 --> 54:36.986
He touched my hand.

54:39.031 --> 54:41.828
He came on to me.

54:44.704 --> 54:46.639
Hey, at least I...

54:46.708 --> 54:49.301
I created a window
of opportunity, right?

54:51.379 --> 54:54.144
When he goes out Friday night,
we go in.

54:54.217 --> 54:55.980
By the time he realizes
you've stood him up,

54:56.052 --> 54:57.814
we'll be long gone
with that gold.

54:57.888 --> 54:59.719
Yeah.

55:00.892 --> 55:03.417
Make sure you shuffle
them cards this time, Left.

55:03.495 --> 55:05.428
Hey, Lyle,

55:05.498 --> 55:07.762
what's the distance between
the front door and the vault?

55:07.834 --> 55:09.096
Don't deal
when my back's turned.

55:09.170 --> 55:11.604
You've got that loser's
paranoia.

55:11.672 --> 55:12.866
Lyle!

55:12.940 --> 55:15.171
He only answers
to The Napster now, Charlie.

55:15.243 --> 55:16.438
No.

55:16.512 --> 55:18.639
I'm not calling you The Napster.

55:18.714 --> 55:19.942
Why not, you call him Left Ear.

55:20.016 --> 55:20.948
Well, I am.

55:21.017 --> 55:22.917
And him, Handsome Rob.

55:22.986 --> 55:24.544
Well, that's because
he is Handsome Rob.

55:24.622 --> 55:25.890
Well, you can call me
The Napster.

55:26.124 --> 55:28.648
Come on, they were at the
same college at the same time.

55:28.726 --> 55:30.886
Why are you encouraging this?

55:30.961 --> 55:32.725
It is a verifiable fact...

55:32.797 --> 55:35.196
he was my roommate,
he stole my ideas.

55:35.267 --> 55:37.030
I am The Napster.

55:38.103 --> 55:40.937
All right, all right.

55:41.007 --> 55:42.200
What is the distance

55:42.275 --> 55:45.108
between the front door
and the vault, Napster?

55:46.878 --> 55:49.244
It's farther
than you want to carry it.

55:49.316 --> 55:51.306
Yeah, but, so,
how do we get the gold

55:51.384 --> 55:53.215
from the vault
to the getaway car?

55:53.286 --> 55:55.812
How wide is the hallway...
Napster?

56:00.994 --> 56:02.552
Six feet.

56:20.149 --> 56:21.673
Okay, you've got your gold.

56:43.342 --> 56:44.501
Whoo!

57:21.684 --> 57:23.709
We need more cars
to handle the weight.

57:23.786 --> 57:26.083
Looks like I'm going to need
some help

57:26.154 --> 57:28.088
with the custom work, too.

57:28.156 --> 57:29.487
I know a man for the job.

57:29.558 --> 57:32.527
So I modified the camera
to include the...

57:32.595 --> 57:35.359
so we can create really
hi-res digital maps.

57:35.431 --> 57:36.489
Who's that?

57:36.566 --> 57:38.431
Rob's mechanic friend.

57:43.106 --> 57:44.368
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

57:44.442 --> 57:46.103
Charlie, this is Wrench.

57:46.177 --> 57:47.643
Hey, what's up, man?

57:47.711 --> 57:49.406
Rob tells me you
got real talent.

57:49.480 --> 57:50.946
We need some body work done.

57:51.015 --> 57:55.418
Need to pack up to 2,700 pounds
of cargo in these Minis

57:55.487 --> 57:56.783
with enough suspension
and horsepower

57:56.855 --> 57:58.880
to outrun anything chasing us.

57:58.957 --> 58:00.721
2,700 pounds of what?

58:00.794 --> 58:03.023
Of whatever.

58:05.131 --> 58:07.191
So, what do I get out
of this mystery deal, man?

58:07.267 --> 58:08.699
10,000.

58:10.704 --> 58:12.365
All right.

58:22.850 --> 58:24.841
What comes around...

58:38.434 --> 58:40.765
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

58:40.837 --> 58:42.702
We didn't get a chance
to meet yet.

58:42.772 --> 58:44.295
Wrench.

58:45.508 --> 58:47.271
Ham and cheese.

58:47.344 --> 58:49.005
Oh. Oh, that's cold.

58:49.079 --> 58:51.171
Damn, that's cold. Mmm.

58:54.185 --> 58:55.378
What comes around

58:57.422 --> 58:59.912
Just comes around

59:15.674 --> 59:16.572
What comes around

59:20.046 --> 59:20.910
What comes around...

59:36.661 --> 59:37.923
You want all greens?

59:37.997 --> 59:39.327
'Cause, ah, 'cause you got them.

59:40.399 --> 59:41.456
What have you got?

59:41.534 --> 59:43.865
Welcome to L.A. 's
Automated Traffic Surveillance

59:43.936 --> 59:46.028
and Control Operations Center.

59:46.105 --> 59:47.868
See, they use video feeds
from intersections

59:47.940 --> 59:49.168
and specifically designed
algorithms

59:49.242 --> 59:50.903
to predict traffic conditions,

59:50.977 --> 59:52.637
and thereby control
traffic lights, so

59:52.711 --> 59:54.645
all I did was come up
with my own

59:54.713 --> 59:57.114
kick-ass algorithm to sneak in,

59:57.185 --> 59:58.879
and now we own the place.

59:58.952 --> 59:59.919
You want to do a dry run?

59:59.986 --> 01:00:01.681
I thought you'd never ask.

01:00:03.826 --> 01:00:04.758
See, red light?

01:00:04.827 --> 01:00:05.794
Green light.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.424
- Danielson?
- Yeah?

01:00:12.501 --> 01:00:13.490
What's up with Grid 34?

01:00:13.569 --> 01:00:15.469
Let's check it out.

01:00:15.537 --> 01:00:16.935
Hey, hey.

01:00:17.005 --> 01:00:18.836
Oh, oops, did I...?

01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:21.375
Oops, wow, but it's awesome.
Is that not awesome?

01:00:21.444 --> 01:00:23.344
- Can you change it back now?
- Yeah.

01:00:29.086 --> 01:00:30.017
Lights are working fine.

01:00:30.086 --> 01:00:32.384
Just an accident.

01:00:33.691 --> 01:00:34.659
That's good.

01:00:36.193 --> 01:00:37.888
What are those?

01:00:37.963 --> 01:00:39.828
Unnecessary engine parts.

01:00:39.898 --> 01:00:43.595
I lost your smog controls,
and 200 pounds of body fat.

01:00:43.668 --> 01:00:46.535
You got yourself
a sweet ride now, Charlie.

01:00:46.605 --> 01:00:47.696
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

01:00:47.839 --> 01:00:48.930
And never getting lost

01:00:49.007 --> 01:00:50.475
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

01:00:50.543 --> 01:00:52.237
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

01:00:52.311 --> 01:00:54.245
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

01:00:54.313 --> 01:00:55.540
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

01:00:55.614 --> 01:00:57.241
And never getting lost

01:00:57.316 --> 01:00:58.944
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

01:00:59.019 --> 01:01:01.145
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

01:01:01.221 --> 01:01:03.586
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor

01:01:03.657 --> 01:01:06.217
Won't stop driving
till it's over

01:01:07.662 --> 01:01:12.394
Still be cruising
when the sun goes down

01:01:12.466 --> 01:01:14.900
Won't stop driving
till it's over

01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:16.664
Put the pedal to the metal
and I'm off

01:01:16.738 --> 01:01:18.068
And never getting lost

01:01:18.139 --> 01:01:19.663
Which way will I turn
when roads cross?

01:01:19.774 --> 01:01:22.174
Press the petal to the metal,
little more when it's scary

01:01:22.244 --> 01:01:25.042
But one thing for sure,
keep my foot on the floor...

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:31.684
You know what
I'm thinking about right now?

01:01:31.787 --> 01:01:34.084
The look on Steve's face.

01:01:45.037 --> 01:01:45.969
You're early.

01:01:46.038 --> 01:01:47.664
I'm in a hurry.

01:01:50.775 --> 01:01:51.799
Of course, you know
that the Florida

01:01:51.876 --> 01:01:54.071
vote rigging was a CIA
and mob operation.

01:01:54.146 --> 01:01:55.078
Is that so?

01:01:55.147 --> 01:01:56.374
Yeah, which is not
so very different

01:01:56.448 --> 01:01:57.641
from when your John F. Kennedy

01:01:57.716 --> 01:02:00.412
won a rigged election
with the help of his father.

01:02:00.486 --> 01:02:02.010
You're uncomfortable
that I mentioned it.

01:02:02.088 --> 01:02:04.612
No, Yevhen, I don't like
making two trips.

01:02:04.691 --> 01:02:06.522
You Americans.

01:02:06.592 --> 01:02:08.287
You love your heroes.

01:02:08.362 --> 01:02:11.228
A holiday for Columbus?

01:02:11.297 --> 01:02:13.162
He makes the wrong turn,

01:02:13.232 --> 01:02:15.666
and wipes out an entire
indigenous people.

01:02:15.769 --> 01:02:16.963
And you know
what he was looking for?

01:02:17.038 --> 01:02:18.664
I bet you're going to tell me.

01:02:18.772 --> 01:02:19.829
Gold.

01:02:19.907 --> 01:02:21.670
Supposedly for Queen Isabella,

01:02:21.809 --> 01:02:23.539
but don't think that
the Medicis back in Italy

01:02:23.611 --> 01:02:25.100
didn't want a part
of that action.

01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:27.409
And what did Italy
need gold for?

01:02:27.482 --> 01:02:31.816
For the long-distance
slave trade based in Venice.

01:02:31.887 --> 01:02:33.148
Venice...
that's where

01:02:33.222 --> 01:02:35.156
these bricks...

01:02:40.397 --> 01:02:41.420
You were saying something?

01:02:41.498 --> 01:02:42.987
Nothing... No...

01:02:43.065 --> 01:02:44.190
No, you were really
on a roll there.

01:02:44.266 --> 01:02:45.630
Don't stop. I'm interested.

01:02:45.701 --> 01:02:47.602
Please, I'm confused,
my English...

01:02:49.973 --> 01:02:50.905
You understand fine.

01:02:50.974 --> 01:02:52.202
Now what do you know
about my gold?

01:02:52.275 --> 01:02:53.207
No, I don't...

01:02:53.277 --> 01:02:55.370
Don't you even think
about lying to me.

01:02:55.446 --> 01:02:58.437
Okay,
okay, l, I heard a rumor

01:02:58.515 --> 01:03:01.006
about a heist in Venice.

01:03:01.085 --> 01:03:03.349
35 million in bricks,

01:03:03.422 --> 01:03:05.753
with an imprint
of a Balinese dancer on them.

01:03:05.823 --> 01:03:07.313
- Who have you told?
- No one.

01:03:07.393 --> 01:03:08.325
Who have you told?

01:03:08.394 --> 01:03:10.363
No one!
I swear to God!

01:03:12.364 --> 01:03:13.490
You swear to God?

01:03:13.566 --> 01:03:15.999
You crazy?
I swear to God.

01:03:16.068 --> 01:03:17.035
I didn't!

01:03:18.571 --> 01:03:19.832
Well, then I guess
I believe you.

01:03:49.772 --> 01:03:51.205
Yevhen?

01:03:53.409 --> 01:03:54.898
Yevhen?

01:04:11.929 --> 01:04:13.089
Let's putt it this time...

01:04:14.232 --> 01:04:16.426
Putt, not drive.

01:04:16.502 --> 01:04:17.798
Very good.

01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:19.131
If you can just get it,

01:04:19.204 --> 01:04:21.139
I know you can,
I know you can do it.

01:04:21.207 --> 01:04:22.468
Much better.

01:04:22.541 --> 01:04:24.566
I'm here to see Skinny Pete.

01:04:24.643 --> 01:04:25.904
Yeah, he's over there.

01:04:25.978 --> 01:04:27.536
Thanks, man.

01:04:30.050 --> 01:04:31.449
- Don't stare.
- Huh?

01:04:31.518 --> 01:04:32.575
Don't stare.

01:04:32.652 --> 01:04:33.982
He doesn't like
when people stare at him.

01:04:34.054 --> 01:04:35.021
Stare at what?

01:04:36.357 --> 01:04:37.618
That was good.
That was good.

01:04:37.691 --> 01:04:39.283
Try that one, I know
you're going to get that one.

01:04:40.561 --> 01:04:42.687
That was great.

01:04:42.763 --> 01:04:44.459
- Skinny Pete.
- Yo, Charlie.

01:04:44.533 --> 01:04:45.692
What's up, man?

01:04:45.834 --> 01:04:47.095
How's it going?

01:04:47.168 --> 01:04:49.693
So was I right
about the gold bricks or what?

01:04:49.805 --> 01:04:51.670
Oh, I'm not here to talk
about that. We need, uh...

01:04:51.741 --> 01:04:54.004
some supplies.

01:04:54.077 --> 01:04:55.009
Baby, go relax.

01:04:55.078 --> 01:04:56.010
Baby...

01:04:56.079 --> 01:04:57.443
Go relax.

01:05:03.419 --> 01:05:04.510
Yo.

01:05:04.587 --> 01:05:06.555
Yo.

01:05:06.623 --> 01:05:08.250
Supplies.

01:05:08.325 --> 01:05:09.155
What's wrong?

01:05:09.226 --> 01:05:10.317
Huh?

01:05:10.394 --> 01:05:13.021
Uh... um, some, uh,

01:05:13.097 --> 01:05:14.222
some nitromin,

01:05:14.299 --> 01:05:15.959
uh...

01:05:16.033 --> 01:05:17.466
some, uh...

01:05:17.536 --> 01:05:19.765
some nitromin, primer...

01:05:19.838 --> 01:05:21.202
- What's wrong?
- Huh?

01:05:21.272 --> 01:05:21.670
Yo.

01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:22.832
Uh, nothing.

01:05:22.909 --> 01:05:23.841
I'm-I'm cool. I'm-I'm great.

01:05:23.910 --> 01:05:25.536
Uh, I just need some,
uh, big can of...

01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:27.544
Nitromin, primer,

01:05:27.612 --> 01:05:28.873
- Detonating cord...
- Right, right.

01:05:28.947 --> 01:05:31.007
...two triple-charged chemical
grenades and a launcher.

01:05:31.083 --> 01:05:33.847
Right, like I had, uh,
you know, told you... earlier.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:35.649
All right.

01:05:41.528 --> 01:05:43.223
Cost you about five G's.

01:05:43.297 --> 01:05:45.265
Done. Call me.

01:05:46.501 --> 01:05:47.990
Thanks, man.
I'm sorry about that.

01:05:48.068 --> 01:05:49.865
Uh-Uh, all right, man.

01:05:49.937 --> 01:05:51.734
- Peace.
- Come on.

01:06:09.392 --> 01:06:11.189
Get out.

01:06:11.828 --> 01:06:13.021
There.

01:06:22.272 --> 01:06:24.035
Vance has something
to tell you.

01:06:27.411 --> 01:06:28.536
Go on.

01:06:31.249 --> 01:06:32.910
A couple weeks back...

01:06:34.519 --> 01:06:37.146
I was working counter
at your cousin's shop.

01:06:37.222 --> 01:06:39.919
A guy come in asking
about gold bricks with Balinese

01:06:39.993 --> 01:06:41.790
dancer on them.

01:06:41.861 --> 01:06:43.293
What did you tell him?

01:06:45.164 --> 01:06:47.358
I told him
that I'd seen some bricks.

01:06:52.439 --> 01:06:54.463
I'm sorry.

01:06:55.777 --> 01:06:58.267
What did this man look like?

01:06:59.513 --> 01:07:00.480
He had, uh...

01:07:00.547 --> 01:07:01.911
long black hair,

01:07:01.982 --> 01:07:03.974
big tattoo on his neck.

01:07:06.388 --> 01:07:09.584
He must have weighed
at least 400 pounds.

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:10.955
I know that guy.

01:07:39.424 --> 01:07:41.084
Baby, go relax.

01:07:52.272 --> 01:07:53.829
Do you know who I am?

01:07:54.907 --> 01:07:56.373
You're Mashkov.

01:07:56.442 --> 01:07:58.343
That's right.

01:07:58.411 --> 01:08:01.039
You were asking
about gold bricks

01:08:01.114 --> 01:08:02.774
with a Balinese dancer
on them.

01:08:03.817 --> 01:08:05.308
Tell me why.

01:08:12.593 --> 01:08:13.958
Steve just called to confirm

01:08:14.029 --> 01:08:15.997
his 8:00 reservation
at the Water Grill.

01:08:16.064 --> 01:08:17.428
Okay, let's go over it
one more time.

01:08:17.499 --> 01:08:20.263
Gas the guards,
doors open 8:15.

01:08:20.335 --> 01:08:22.304
Safe popped by 8:25.

01:08:22.372 --> 01:08:24.770
Loaded by 8:35,
out the door by 8:45.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.363
Straight to Union Station.

01:08:26.442 --> 01:08:27.772
Only green lights on your route.

01:08:27.844 --> 01:08:29.004
The rest of the city's red.

01:08:29.078 --> 01:08:30.670
Cops are stuck in the traffic,
like everyone else.

01:08:30.781 --> 01:08:31.805
Train leaves at 10:00.

01:08:31.881 --> 01:08:34.076
Cars have to be
on the carrier by 9:30.

01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:36.140
Timing's got to be dead on.

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:37.481
Let's get ready.

01:08:37.554 --> 01:08:38.986
Let's get it.

01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:12.652
Wow, that is a nice car.

01:09:12.792 --> 01:09:14.453
Sorry, Rob.

01:09:14.528 --> 01:09:15.721
Coast is clear, guys.

01:09:27.609 --> 01:09:28.541
This is it, guys.

01:09:28.609 --> 01:09:29.577
Moment of truth.

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:32.404
What the hell is this?

01:09:34.716 --> 01:09:36.581
Shit!

01:09:36.652 --> 01:09:38.644
Steve's neighbor's
throwing a party.

01:09:42.058 --> 01:09:43.649
Are you here
for the, uh, Baker party, sir?

01:09:43.725 --> 01:09:45.523
No.

01:09:48.032 --> 01:09:49.966
We're not blowing
any gates tonight, guys.

01:09:50.033 --> 01:09:51.694
Too many witnesses.

01:09:51.801 --> 01:09:52.825
Stella.

01:09:52.903 --> 01:09:55.599
I know, I know.

01:09:57.375 --> 01:09:59.275
I'm late for my date.

01:09:59.344 --> 01:10:02.006
Yeah, and you got to be
charming.

01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.707
You'll need him
to ask you out again.

01:10:03.816 --> 01:10:05.077
Sorry.

01:10:05.150 --> 01:10:07.743
Let's get out of the street.

01:10:11.657 --> 01:10:13.648
I really can't imagine
you doing that.

01:10:13.726 --> 01:10:15.421
What's that supposed to mean?

01:10:15.495 --> 01:10:17.052
Well, you don't really seem

01:10:17.129 --> 01:10:20.896
like the adventurous type,
you know?

01:10:20.968 --> 01:10:24.266
Don't let the cable uniform,
you know, throw you.

01:10:24.338 --> 01:10:27.466
I wasn't making assumptions.

01:10:27.542 --> 01:10:28.940
I've made some
assumptions about you.

01:10:29.009 --> 01:10:31.705
Oh, really?

01:10:31.779 --> 01:10:32.837
And?

01:10:36.084 --> 01:10:38.109
Well... you're just going
to have to wait and see.

01:10:44.059 --> 01:10:46.254
Why wait?
Let's get a check.

01:10:46.328 --> 01:10:47.521
Let's go back to my place.

01:10:47.596 --> 01:10:48.564
No assumptions...

01:10:48.632 --> 01:10:50.155
Not tonight.
It's late.

01:10:50.233 --> 01:10:51.200
I should go home.

01:10:51.268 --> 01:10:54.294
What, you have
a cable company curfew?

01:10:54.371 --> 01:10:55.338
No,

01:10:55.405 --> 01:10:58.772
but I've made some
bad calls in the past.

01:10:58.842 --> 01:11:00.035
Hey.

01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:02.305
We should take this maybe a
little slower, you know?

01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:05.110
This lovely dinner,
sparkling conversation...

01:11:05.182 --> 01:11:06.206
you still don't trust me?

01:11:06.284 --> 01:11:10.050
Oh, I trust everyone.

01:11:10.121 --> 01:11:13.420
It's the devil inside them
I don't trust.

01:11:17.896 --> 01:11:19.660
It's an interesting saying.

01:11:19.732 --> 01:11:21.096
It's charming.
Where'd you pick that up?

01:11:22.635 --> 01:11:23.566
Can't remember.

01:11:23.636 --> 01:11:25.159
Really?

01:11:25.238 --> 01:11:27.399
I knew a guy who said it
exactly like that.

01:11:27.474 --> 01:11:28.565
Really?

01:11:28.642 --> 01:11:31.041
Yeah. He's the only person
I've ever heard say that.

01:11:31.111 --> 01:11:33.101
He said it all the time.

01:11:33.179 --> 01:11:34.305
His name was John Bridger.

01:11:35.684 --> 01:11:38.015
You're hurting my wrist.

01:11:38.085 --> 01:11:40.450
He had a daughter
and she was about your age.

01:11:44.159 --> 01:11:46.626
Let go of my wrist.

01:11:46.695 --> 01:11:48.629
I knew that there was
something familiar about you.

01:11:48.697 --> 01:11:51.860
You're exactly like
your old man, you know that?

01:11:51.934 --> 01:11:54.596
I liked him, too,
right from the start.

01:11:54.670 --> 01:11:56.534
I liked him right up
until the minute I shot him.

01:11:59.242 --> 01:12:01.471
Who are you working with?

01:12:06.216 --> 01:12:07.877
She's with us.

01:12:19.664 --> 01:12:20.891
Gang's all here.

01:12:20.965 --> 01:12:23.730
You know, the only thing
worse than a thief, Bendel?

01:12:23.802 --> 01:12:25.359
A coward.

01:12:25.437 --> 01:12:26.461
Then you should have seen

01:12:26.537 --> 01:12:28.198
the way your daddy
begged for his life.

01:12:31.844 --> 01:12:32.833
It's not worth it.

01:12:32.911 --> 01:12:34.002
Put a leash on your cat.

01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:40.609
Hi, Steve.

01:12:40.688 --> 01:12:41.949
Charlie.

01:12:43.724 --> 01:12:45.589
Not bad, Charlie.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:46.649
Really, not bad.

01:12:46.727 --> 01:12:48.853
You have no idea
how hard it is for me

01:12:48.929 --> 01:12:50.658
not to reach across
this table and kill you

01:12:50.731 --> 01:12:52.095
with my bare hands.

01:12:52.166 --> 01:12:53.634
You know better than that,
Charlie.

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:56.192
Can't let emotion
into these things.

01:12:56.271 --> 01:12:57.362
Tell me it wasn't about emotion

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:59.100
when you shot John
and left us all for dead.

01:12:59.174 --> 01:13:00.904
That wasn't about emotion.

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:03.206
It was about a lot of gold,
and I wanted it.

01:13:03.279 --> 01:13:05.144
Anything you think you
deserved, you didn't.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:07.704
Hey, don't talk about right
and wrong with me, man,

01:13:07.816 --> 01:13:09.375
'cause I just don't give a shit.

01:13:09.453 --> 01:13:10.919
Okay?

01:13:10.987 --> 01:13:13.649
You got your cards,
I got my cards,

01:13:13.724 --> 01:13:16.192
we made our play,
and I came out on top, okay?

01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:17.989
Now if you want to start
the game up again,

01:13:18.063 --> 01:13:19.825
that's fine with me.

01:13:19.897 --> 01:13:24.129
But what, I mean, what
is your play here, really?

01:13:24.202 --> 01:13:26.102
I mean, come on, what do you...
what do you think?

01:13:26.171 --> 01:13:29.106
Y-you'll try to take out
my guards, right?

01:13:29.174 --> 01:13:32.110
I have five of them
that you don't know about.

01:13:32.178 --> 01:13:34.475
You'll try to have
Lyle hack the system.

01:13:34.547 --> 01:13:35.843
I'll change it again
tomorrow morning.

01:13:35.914 --> 01:13:38.747
What, what, what was
y-your final move?

01:13:38.850 --> 01:13:40.682
I mean, you were going
to have Bridger's daughter

01:13:40.754 --> 01:13:42.722
come in and try
to crack my safe?

01:13:42.789 --> 01:13:46.121
I mean, that's...
that's very poetic and all,

01:13:46.192 --> 01:13:47.750
but I just don't see it.

01:13:47.829 --> 01:13:49.193
I don't think she'll get
anywhere near it.

01:13:49.262 --> 01:13:50.922
Same old Steve, huh?

01:13:50.998 --> 01:13:53.329
Always thinking defensively.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.095
That's why you're
always number two.

01:13:55.169 --> 01:13:57.228
How do you figure that?

01:13:57.305 --> 01:13:58.772
You got no imagination.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.171
Couldn't even decide what
to do with all that money.

01:14:01.242 --> 01:14:03.268
You had to buy what
everybody else wanted.

01:14:03.345 --> 01:14:05.710
Oh... well, try this on
in your imagination, okay?

01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:06.871
That gold is already gone.

01:14:06.948 --> 01:14:08.609
That's bullshit, Steve.

01:14:08.684 --> 01:14:10.619
No, really, it's over Charlie.

01:14:10.687 --> 01:14:12.621
I'm trying to move
the last two bricks.

01:14:12.689 --> 01:14:15.282
You want to come after me
over a couple of lousy bricks?

01:14:15.357 --> 01:14:17.416
I mean, really, be my guest.

01:14:17.493 --> 01:14:19.223
But you're off to a bad start,
you know?

01:14:19.295 --> 01:14:20.420
'Cause you just blew
the best thing

01:14:20.497 --> 01:14:21.429
you had going for you.

01:14:21.498 --> 01:14:23.557
You just blew the element
of surprise.

01:14:27.505 --> 01:14:28.801
Surprised?

01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:33.233
It's over when I say it's over.

01:14:37.215 --> 01:14:39.240
Are you all right, sir?

01:15:11.085 --> 01:15:12.176
How you doing?

01:15:14.390 --> 01:15:17.153
Good...

01:15:17.225 --> 01:15:19.955
considering...

01:15:20.028 --> 01:15:22.394
considering the fact
that I'm doing all of this

01:15:22.464 --> 01:15:23.725
for a man I barely knew.

01:15:31.007 --> 01:15:36.071
You know what bothered me
all those years, Charlie?

01:15:36.147 --> 01:15:39.582
It was that, whenever
he'd call me to tell me

01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:41.617
that he was on some job,

01:15:41.685 --> 01:15:45.247
I knew you were right there
with him.

01:15:48.426 --> 01:15:51.088
You got to know him
a lot better than I did.

01:15:53.165 --> 01:15:54.962
Just 'cause he was around
me more doesn't mean

01:15:55.034 --> 01:15:56.694
he wasn't thinking
about you all the time.

01:15:56.768 --> 01:15:59.135
Be nice if it was true.

01:15:59.206 --> 01:16:00.467
It is true.

01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:02.440
He always regretted
not having been

01:16:02.508 --> 01:16:04.499
a good enough father
to you, Stella.

01:16:07.381 --> 01:16:08.814
How do you know that?

01:16:08.883 --> 01:16:11.282
Because he told me.

01:16:17.958 --> 01:16:19.185
What did you do to your hand?

01:16:23.531 --> 01:16:24.520
I punched Steve.

01:16:24.599 --> 01:16:27.863
Why do you get to punch him
and I don't?

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:32.305
Those hands are
way too valuable.

01:16:40.284 --> 01:16:41.648
Hey.

01:16:47.258 --> 01:16:49.122
Okay?

01:16:57.835 --> 01:16:59.462
There'll be nothing left
of that if you keep rubbing it.

01:17:05.978 --> 01:17:08.971
Tell Mr. Frazelli
we'll see him at 8:00.

01:17:09.049 --> 01:17:10.242
Charlie!

01:17:12.919 --> 01:17:13.976
He's flying the coop.

01:17:15.288 --> 01:17:16.447
When?

01:17:16.523 --> 01:17:17.990
His security guard called

01:17:18.058 --> 01:17:20.218
for a private helicopter
at 4:00 PM.

01:17:20.294 --> 01:17:22.887
There's an armored car service
coming to his house at 5:00.

01:17:22.963 --> 01:17:26.730
There is a cargo plane scheduled
to depart LAX at 8:00 PM

01:17:26.802 --> 01:17:27.733
to Mexico City.

01:17:27.803 --> 01:17:31.238
What if he's moving the safe
as a diversion?

01:17:31.305 --> 01:17:33.000
We crack it, it's empty,
the gold's somewhere else.

01:17:33.075 --> 01:17:35.134
Steve's not about to let
that gold out of his sight.

01:17:35.210 --> 01:17:36.336
It's going to be in that truck

01:17:36.411 --> 01:17:37.638
and he's going to be watching it

01:17:37.713 --> 01:17:39.407
every step of the way
from the helicopter.

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:41.210
So the gold's headed to Mexico.

01:17:41.284 --> 01:17:42.251
Who knows where?

01:17:42.318 --> 01:17:43.409
They could change
the flight plan in midair.

01:17:43.486 --> 01:17:44.418
Slow down, slow down.

01:17:44.487 --> 01:17:45.351
You guys are looking at this
the wrong way.

01:17:45.421 --> 01:17:46.445
This is good news for us.

01:17:46.522 --> 01:17:48.752
Charlie, what do you
mean, "good news"?

01:17:48.858 --> 01:17:50.655
We've been trying to get
to the gold in the safe,

01:17:50.728 --> 01:17:51.921
now the safe is coming to us.

01:17:51.995 --> 01:17:53.325
We're going to boost it
in transit.

01:17:53.397 --> 01:17:54.328
Charlie, it could take

01:17:54.397 --> 01:17:55.524
a dozen different routes
to the airport.

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.294
We have no idea which one.

01:17:57.368 --> 01:17:59.597
We can't take out an armored
truck during rush hour.

01:17:59.670 --> 01:18:00.637
We're already set up to do it.

01:18:00.704 --> 01:18:02.103
Napster,

01:18:02.172 --> 01:18:06.200
gridlock every route
except for the one we choose.

01:18:06.277 --> 01:18:08.471
Force that truck to go
exactly where we want it to go.

01:18:08.546 --> 01:18:09.705
Where do we want it to go?

01:18:09.848 --> 01:18:12.339
We can't have a shoot-out
with armed guards. We'd lose.

01:18:12.418 --> 01:18:14.818
We do it like the Italian job.

01:18:21.027 --> 01:18:22.016
Hello?

01:18:22.094 --> 01:18:23.356
Why'd you do it?

01:18:23.430 --> 01:18:24.259
Do what?

01:18:24.330 --> 01:18:25.058
Yevhen.

01:18:25.131 --> 01:18:26.827
You didn't have to clip him.

01:18:26.901 --> 01:18:27.868
Whoa, whoa.
What are you talking about?

01:18:27.935 --> 01:18:28.867
We didn't clip anybody.

01:18:28.936 --> 01:18:29.960
Yevhen's cousin is under

01:18:30.037 --> 01:18:32.698
the distinct impression
that you did.

01:18:32.773 --> 01:18:33.830
Why does he think that?

01:18:33.907 --> 01:18:35.068
Because you want to know

01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:37.077
about the gold
with the Balinese dancer.

01:18:37.145 --> 01:18:38.407
You told him that?

01:18:38.479 --> 01:18:39.740
Listen to me, man.

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:41.644
If there's one thing that I know

01:18:41.716 --> 01:18:43.685
is never to mess
with Mother Nature,

01:18:43.752 --> 01:18:46.311
mother-in-laws
or mother-freakin' Ukrainians.

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:49.949
Look, I need a favor.

01:19:15.987 --> 01:19:17.044
Yeah.

01:19:17.122 --> 01:19:18.213
Had a hiccup last night.

01:19:18.290 --> 01:19:19.222
Could use some help.

01:19:19.291 --> 01:19:20.382
Want hands-on this time.

01:19:20.459 --> 01:19:21.721
You interested?

01:19:21.793 --> 01:19:22.725
Could be.

01:19:22.794 --> 01:19:25.023
But I don't like
to be kept in the dark.

01:19:25.097 --> 01:19:27.463
If I'm in, I'm in.

01:19:27.533 --> 01:19:29.694
Okay, you're in.

01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:30.997
All right.

01:19:33.807 --> 01:19:35.205
What do you think, Charlie?

01:19:35.274 --> 01:19:36.263
This'll work.

01:19:36.342 --> 01:19:37.809
Let's go.

01:19:48.689 --> 01:19:50.088
You're amazing.

01:19:50.158 --> 01:19:51.556
It's a work of genius.

01:19:51.625 --> 01:19:52.593
Uh-huh.

01:20:01.337 --> 01:20:03.305
You okay?

01:20:03.372 --> 01:20:04.304
Just give me a moment.

01:20:04.373 --> 01:20:05.498
Now?

01:20:05.574 --> 01:20:08.737
I'm about to insert this pin
into this detonator tube,

01:20:08.812 --> 01:20:10.780
and if the brass touches
the sides,

01:20:10.914 --> 01:20:13.405
we'll both be the last people
we ever see.

01:20:16.254 --> 01:20:18.085
Take all the time you need.

01:20:21.159 --> 01:20:22.716
Hey, Charlie.

01:20:22.792 --> 01:20:25.785
What?

01:20:25.897 --> 01:20:29.263
I love you, man.

01:20:29.334 --> 01:20:31.632
I love you, too.

01:20:34.173 --> 01:20:37.267
Okay.
Okay.

01:20:47.688 --> 01:20:49.450
Your attention, please.

01:20:49.522 --> 01:20:51.353
Metrolink train number 774
will arrive

01:20:51.425 --> 01:20:53.188
in approximately 15 minutes.

01:21:10.146 --> 01:21:11.703
Check positions.

01:21:11.781 --> 01:21:12.770
Napster?

01:21:12.882 --> 01:21:15.715
I'm in position.

01:21:15.785 --> 01:21:17.308
Handsome Rob?

01:21:17.387 --> 01:21:18.580
We're in position.

01:21:18.655 --> 01:21:20.680
Everything's quiet, Charlie.

01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.751
Wrench?

01:21:25.829 --> 01:21:27.490
Set.

01:21:43.749 --> 01:21:45.410
Charlie, we got
an uninvited visitor.

01:21:45.484 --> 01:21:48.145
Some motorcycle guard
following the truck.

01:21:48.220 --> 01:21:49.188
We'll deal with it.

01:21:55.594 --> 01:21:57.290
Who are these cats?

01:21:57.365 --> 01:21:58.422
What's wrong?

01:21:58.499 --> 01:22:00.467
Charlie, you won't believe this.

01:22:00.534 --> 01:22:02.593
He's brought in
three armored trucks.

01:22:02.670 --> 01:22:06.231
It's a shell game.
Shell game now.

01:22:06.307 --> 01:22:08.036
Well, boss,
I can't reroute the truck

01:22:08.109 --> 01:22:09.940
if I don't know which truck
to reroute.

01:22:10.011 --> 01:22:11.774
Just go with the one
Steve follows in the helicopter.

01:22:11.881 --> 01:22:15.145
Remember, he said he'd never let
that gold out of his sight.

01:22:15.217 --> 01:22:17.276
Unless he's playing us,
and he is.

01:22:28.598 --> 01:22:30.293
Okay, let's go!

01:22:30.367 --> 01:22:32.358
Moving out!

01:22:45.017 --> 01:22:46.608
Here we go.

01:22:46.685 --> 01:22:48.312
They're pulling out.

01:22:48.386 --> 01:22:50.012
Napster,

01:22:50.088 --> 01:22:52.990
pull up the traffic cameras
you're watching.

01:22:53.059 --> 01:22:55.789
Where's the first camera
the trucks go past?

01:22:58.832 --> 01:23:01.527
Vine and Yucca; they're all
going to cross there.

01:23:01.601 --> 01:23:03.795
See which one's riding low.

01:23:14.749 --> 01:23:16.182
First one is...

01:23:18.653 --> 01:23:20.382
First two are the same, so...

01:23:24.593 --> 01:23:27.459
Houston, we have our truck.
It is number 128.

01:23:36.339 --> 01:23:38.365
We're moving out.

01:23:39.876 --> 01:23:41.741
Three-kilo-bob
to two-fox-mike,

01:23:41.812 --> 01:23:43.039
we're heading to the airport.

01:23:57.629 --> 01:24:01.588
Okay, guys, truck 128
has turned right heading west.

01:24:01.666 --> 01:24:03.361
Gridlock time.

01:24:04.936 --> 01:24:08.566
Mr. Scott, pick up
a courtesy telephone please.

01:24:08.642 --> 01:24:10.507
Mr. Scott, pick up a courtesy...

01:24:12.513 --> 01:24:14.446
We've crashed.

01:24:16.250 --> 01:24:18.184
It's not a crash.

01:24:19.353 --> 01:24:20.751
We've got power.

01:24:21.822 --> 01:24:23.619
I can't log in.

01:24:23.690 --> 01:24:28.093
They are about to hit a major
detour and be sent your way.

01:24:35.004 --> 01:24:35.971
Oops.

01:24:40.477 --> 01:24:43.741
You'll... never... shut down...

01:24:43.814 --> 01:24:46.577
the real... Napster.

01:24:54.291 --> 01:24:55.656
What's your problem?!

01:25:01.999 --> 01:25:03.900
Truck 128,
what is your progress?

01:25:03.969 --> 01:25:05.731
This is truck 128.

01:25:05.803 --> 01:25:07.566
Traffic's out of control here.

01:25:07.638 --> 01:25:09.572
We've got to look
for another route.

01:25:09.641 --> 01:25:13.008
Check the police band.

01:25:13.078 --> 01:25:15.012
Okay, I'm opening up
a space on Highland.

01:25:19.352 --> 01:25:20.750
Oh, get us out of here.

01:25:20.821 --> 01:25:21.912
I'm trying.

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.920
And he's taking it.

01:25:34.568 --> 01:25:36.297
Police scanners are saying
computers are down

01:25:36.371 --> 01:25:37.360
at Traffic Control Center.

01:25:37.439 --> 01:25:40.499
Nice, Charlie.

01:25:40.575 --> 01:25:42.805
What are you up to?

01:25:42.878 --> 01:25:45.141
Go back.

01:25:53.256 --> 01:25:55.553
I now command you to turn left.

01:25:57.528 --> 01:25:59.017
Come on, take the left.

01:26:01.198 --> 01:26:02.529
Yeah, you did.

01:26:02.599 --> 01:26:04.156
You did.

01:26:38.705 --> 01:26:40.036
Give us the flag.

01:26:40.107 --> 01:26:42.098
Metro just passed through
the station.

01:26:42.176 --> 01:26:44.202
You are clear for 90 seconds.

01:26:44.279 --> 01:26:45.404
Go.

01:27:01.598 --> 01:27:02.257
Come on, Steve.

01:27:19.283 --> 01:27:20.147
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:27:24.389 --> 01:27:27.085
Look out!
Look out!

01:27:27.158 --> 01:27:28.125
30 seconds and counting.

01:27:35.701 --> 01:27:37.031
15 seconds,
you're either blocked in

01:27:37.103 --> 01:27:38.229
or you're paint on the train.

01:27:44.211 --> 01:27:45.178
Go, go, come on, come on!

01:27:46.447 --> 01:27:47.970
Stay right on me,
this is gonna be tight.

01:27:55.023 --> 01:27:56.455
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:27:56.524 --> 01:27:58.458
You're gonna stop right there.

01:28:36.868 --> 01:28:38.334
Okay, guys.

01:28:38.403 --> 01:28:39.801
Coming into position.

01:28:39.905 --> 01:28:41.202
Stay cool.

01:28:53.252 --> 01:28:54.583
Ten...

01:28:54.655 --> 01:28:56.715
nine...

01:28:56.791 --> 01:28:58.519
eight...

01:28:58.592 --> 01:29:00.321
seven...

01:29:00.394 --> 01:29:01.724
six...

01:29:01.795 --> 01:29:03.423
five...

01:29:03.498 --> 01:29:05.193
four...

01:29:05.266 --> 01:29:06.027
Don't lose 'em,
don't lose 'em,

01:29:06.101 --> 01:29:07.534
- Don't lose them.
- Three...

01:29:07.602 --> 01:29:09.536
two...

01:29:09.604 --> 01:29:11.265
one.

01:29:32.864 --> 01:29:34.455
Damn.

01:29:40.705 --> 01:29:42.263
Where's my truck?

01:29:42.341 --> 01:29:44.866
What...? What the fuck
happened to my truck?!

01:29:49.314 --> 01:29:51.215
It just blew right through
the street.

01:29:51.284 --> 01:29:52.716
Well, get under there.

01:30:03.463 --> 01:30:06.160
We have another problem, guys.

01:30:06.233 --> 01:30:07.029
What?

01:30:08.169 --> 01:30:09.999
This isn't the Worthington 1000.

01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.934
What?

01:30:12.239 --> 01:30:13.832
He switched safes on us.

01:30:15.310 --> 01:30:16.503
Can you do it?

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:17.942
It's Israeli made.

01:30:18.013 --> 01:30:19.639
It's got a glass re-lock system.

01:30:19.713 --> 01:30:21.840
There's a pane of glass
right here behind this door.

01:30:21.951 --> 01:30:23.645
And if I don't drill perfectly
through that hole,

01:30:23.718 --> 01:30:25.583
steel rods snap into place

01:30:25.655 --> 01:30:26.814
and you can't open the safe.

01:30:26.888 --> 01:30:28.583
And then we're up shit creek.

01:30:57.922 --> 01:31:01.450
I think I just
cracked the glass.

01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:04.528
I don't think it broke though.

01:31:04.597 --> 01:31:07.395
I can't drill it again.

01:31:07.466 --> 01:31:09.992
I have to do it by touch.

01:31:12.405 --> 01:31:13.564
I can't get through.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.163
The train's blocking the tunnel.

01:31:15.242 --> 01:31:17.108
Where does the Metro rail
come above ground?

01:31:17.178 --> 01:31:18.145
11th and Fig.

01:31:18.212 --> 01:31:19.839
Positions two and three,

01:31:19.914 --> 01:31:21.710
meet at 11th and Figueroa
and double back

01:31:21.782 --> 01:31:22.839
to Hollywood and Highland.

01:31:22.917 --> 01:31:24.509
Hurry up!

01:31:39.235 --> 01:31:41.203
Your attention please.

01:31:41.271 --> 01:31:43.262
Baggage for train number 22

01:31:43.339 --> 01:31:45.568
is now available
at carousel number four.

01:31:45.642 --> 01:31:48.544
Baggage for train number 22
is now available

01:31:48.612 --> 01:31:50.340
at carousel number four.

01:32:23.784 --> 01:32:25.718
I can't do this, Charlie.

01:32:25.786 --> 01:32:26.718
Stella...

01:32:26.787 --> 01:32:27.844
I can't do it...
I need a drill,

01:32:27.989 --> 01:32:29.148
a borescope, something.

01:32:29.223 --> 01:32:30.587
- I need to...
- You don't need any of that.

01:32:30.658 --> 01:32:31.988
Come on, Charlie.

01:32:32.059 --> 01:32:34.220
Hey, you can do this.

01:33:29.356 --> 01:33:30.549
Slide.

01:33:30.623 --> 01:33:31.919
Come on, come on.

01:33:38.466 --> 01:33:39.989
Hey.

01:33:40.067 --> 01:33:43.230
Don't you want to see
what's inside?

01:33:43.304 --> 01:33:44.395
Absolutely.

01:33:47.709 --> 01:33:49.199
Napster.

01:33:49.277 --> 01:33:50.209
Yeah?

01:33:50.278 --> 01:33:52.304
13 across, four high, four deep.

01:33:53.949 --> 01:33:56.382
That's, uh, 208 bricks.

01:33:56.451 --> 01:33:57.610
How much?

01:33:57.686 --> 01:34:00.052
Oh. Uh, 208 times...

01:34:03.527 --> 01:34:04.993
2.7... 2.7 million.

01:34:05.061 --> 01:34:05.789
What?

01:34:06.863 --> 01:34:07.988
No, it's 27.

01:34:08.065 --> 01:34:09.430
That's 27 million.

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:11.433
That's $27 million
worth of gold.

01:34:15.773 --> 01:34:18.799
Yeah!

01:34:18.876 --> 01:34:22.779
Got the... holy spirit.

01:34:22.848 --> 01:34:25.281
You should get on it.
It's a good train.

01:35:02.557 --> 01:35:04.024
What did you think, John?

01:35:12.168 --> 01:35:13.692
27 million.

01:35:13.770 --> 01:35:15.202
Say it again.

01:35:15.271 --> 01:35:17.569
- 27 million.
- Say it again.

01:35:17.641 --> 01:35:19.575
- Say it again!
- 27 million.

01:35:19.643 --> 01:35:20.802
Say it again!

01:35:44.336 --> 01:35:46.031
Two motorcycles on us, Charlie.

01:35:49.376 --> 01:35:51.037
I've got three Minis
in the storm drain

01:35:51.111 --> 01:35:52.668
heading east towards
the L.A. River.

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:54.338
Stop them before they get
to the street.

01:35:59.352 --> 01:36:00.376
Shit!

01:36:04.659 --> 01:36:05.250
Whoa!

01:36:19.542 --> 01:36:20.406
Here we go.

01:36:29.653 --> 01:36:30.277
Whoo!

01:36:32.388 --> 01:36:32.911
Whoa! Whoa!

01:36:35.659 --> 01:36:36.250
Open your door.

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:43.693
Come on, guys, we're moving.

01:36:48.907 --> 01:36:50.374
There, there, there, there,
there, there.

01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:02.648
Hey, come on, come on, look out.

01:37:29.953 --> 01:37:31.580
Come on!

01:37:38.362 --> 01:37:40.591
Where you going?
Where you going?

01:38:00.019 --> 01:38:00.883
I'm going to take Steve.

01:38:00.953 --> 01:38:02.044
You guys go straight
to Union Station.

01:38:02.121 --> 01:38:03.315
I'll meet you there.

01:38:04.557 --> 01:38:06.114
Stay on him.
Stay on him!

01:38:14.568 --> 01:38:16.661
Okay, Charlie, I'm opening up
a spot on lower Grand.

01:38:20.174 --> 01:38:21.835
I know it's you, Charlie.

01:38:23.846 --> 01:38:24.835
Take your next left.

01:39:24.578 --> 01:39:25.875
Nice move, Steve.

01:40:04.289 --> 01:40:05.346
Get out!

01:40:05.423 --> 01:40:07.254
- Get out!
- Okay.

01:40:07.325 --> 01:40:08.848
I said get out!

01:41:43.697 --> 01:41:44.630
They got a bunch of cars

01:41:44.699 --> 01:41:46.290
in there, right?
Mini Coopers?

01:41:46.366 --> 01:41:48.357
Look, look, man...

01:41:48.435 --> 01:41:50.835
- I don't know anything...
- Hey, don't worry about them.

01:41:50.905 --> 01:41:53.305
I'll give you five grand
you put me inside that car.

01:41:57.812 --> 01:42:00.178
Buy your girlfriend
something nice.

01:42:04.821 --> 01:42:06.481
Come on.

01:42:12.262 --> 01:42:14.321
Half now, half when
you help me unload.

01:42:19.270 --> 01:42:21.396
I've got to hand it
to you, Steve.

01:42:21.471 --> 01:42:24.702
You actually played this one
pretty smart.

01:42:24.775 --> 01:42:27.403
Decoy trucks...
you switched safes.

01:42:27.479 --> 01:42:28.672
The helicopter routine,

01:42:28.746 --> 01:42:30.509
I mean, that was
pretty damn good.

01:42:30.582 --> 01:42:34.177
But now I've got the gold...
and you, you've got nothing.

01:42:34.252 --> 01:42:35.014
I got this.

01:42:35.087 --> 01:42:36.280
So cut the crap,

01:42:36.355 --> 01:42:38.050
and give me my goddamn gold!

01:42:52.139 --> 01:42:54.073
Who the hell are you?

01:42:54.141 --> 01:42:55.939
I am Mashkov...

01:42:56.044 --> 01:42:57.943
and you killed my cousin Yevhen.

01:42:58.046 --> 01:42:59.979
Got to have some insurance,
Steve.

01:43:09.457 --> 01:43:11.119
Yevhen was already dead
when I got there.

01:43:11.193 --> 01:43:13.218
I'm sorry about that,
but Yevhen dealt with

01:43:13.295 --> 01:43:14.454
a lot of unsavory people.

01:43:14.530 --> 01:43:16.191
Now, this guy's
trying to play you.

01:43:16.265 --> 01:43:18.257
You are right...

01:43:18.335 --> 01:43:20.268
no imagination.

01:43:23.073 --> 01:43:24.630
There's a lot of gold in there.

01:43:24.708 --> 01:43:26.232
We're the only ones with guns.

01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:27.708
I'll make you a good deal.

01:43:35.787 --> 01:43:37.652
I've already made my deal.

01:43:42.962 --> 01:43:44.326
What do you want?

01:43:44.396 --> 01:43:46.659
You know this was
never about the gold.

01:43:46.732 --> 01:43:48.893
Whatever helps you
sleep at night, sweetheart.

01:43:53.306 --> 01:43:54.933
Bitch!

01:43:55.041 --> 01:43:56.737
Charlie! Come on, Charlie!

01:43:58.345 --> 01:43:59.470
Okay.

01:44:02.916 --> 01:44:04.178
Wait a minute
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:44:04.251 --> 01:44:05.843
Wait a minute. I'll double
whatever he's giving you.

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:06.852
Just don't shoot me.

01:44:06.921 --> 01:44:09.081
Don't worry, I'm not
going to shoot you.

01:44:09.156 --> 01:44:12.149
No, I'm going to take you
to my workplace.

01:44:12.227 --> 01:44:14.058
I think you would be
very interested

01:44:14.129 --> 01:44:15.720
in some of the machinery I use.

01:44:18.633 --> 01:44:19.600
No, come on.

01:44:25.174 --> 01:44:26.231
Guys.

01:44:26.309 --> 01:44:28.436
I want to make a toast.

01:44:28.511 --> 01:44:29.910
To John Bridger,

01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:32.641
the most brilliant
master planner of all.

01:44:32.715 --> 01:44:34.649
Father and friend.

01:44:34.717 --> 01:44:35.742
To my dad.

01:44:40.725 --> 01:44:41.918
Stella was right.

01:44:41.992 --> 01:44:43.459
It wasn't about the money.

01:44:43.528 --> 01:44:45.018
Of course that
didn't stop the guys

01:44:45.096 --> 01:44:46.426
from having a little bit of fun.

01:44:46.498 --> 01:44:48.432
Money!

01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:50.933
Handsome Rob
got his Aston Martin.

01:44:52.538 --> 01:44:55.473
Get a good job with good pay...

01:44:55.541 --> 01:44:57.770
He took it
for a ride to break it in.

01:45:00.013 --> 01:45:06.383
Money, it's a gas

01:45:06.453 --> 01:45:11.652
Grab that cash with both hands
and make a stash

01:45:11.726 --> 01:45:13.215
He got off with a warning.

01:45:13.293 --> 01:45:16.889
New car, caviar,
four star daydream

01:45:16.965 --> 01:45:19.524
Left Ear got his dream house
in the south of Spain

01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:22.570
with a room just for his shoes.

01:45:22.638 --> 01:45:23.695
Buenos dias.

01:45:23.772 --> 01:45:26.899
Buenos dias.

01:45:26.975 --> 01:45:31.106
Money, get back

01:45:31.181 --> 01:45:33.580
Lyle finally made the cover
of Wired Magazine.

01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:38.109
I'm all right, Jack, keep
your hands off of my stack

01:45:38.189 --> 01:45:39.280
Are you really the Napster?

01:45:39.356 --> 01:45:40.720
Money!

01:45:40.790 --> 01:45:41.915
Yes, I am.

01:45:41.991 --> 01:45:43.925
And he got that
kick-ass stereo he wanted.

01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:48.122
Uh, would you listen
to something for me?

01:45:48.199 --> 01:45:49.324
With speakers so loud

01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:51.594
they'd blow
a woman's clothes off.

01:45:51.669 --> 01:45:55.127
I'm in the high-fidelity...

01:45:55.208 --> 01:45:56.333
If you would.

01:45:56.408 --> 01:45:57.931
...first class traveling set

01:45:58.009 --> 01:46:03.413
And I think I need a Lear jet

01:46:12.158 --> 01:46:13.887
And me?

01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:16.896
I took John Bridger's advice.

01:46:16.964 --> 01:46:20.228
I found somebody I want to spend
the rest of my life with

01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:21.891
and I'm gonna hold on
to her forever.
