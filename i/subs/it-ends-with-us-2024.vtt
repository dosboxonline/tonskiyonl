WEBVTT

01:51.862 --> 01:54.239
Hey. Come here. I got you.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.701
- I'm so sorry.
- Hey, you're gonna be okay.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.162
I'm so sorry
you couldn't be here, honey.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.290
I don't know what we're gonna do.
What are we gonna do?

02:09.128 --> 02:10.464
Okay.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.924
Oh, God. We have to pick flowers.

02:11.924 --> 02:13.133
We do, yeah.

02:13.133 --> 02:16.261
I can't believe we're picking flowers
for your father's funeral.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.554
I know. I know.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.182
I don't know why you moved.
I don't understand it.

02:20.182 --> 02:22.476
I mean, if I had
that job that you had--

02:22.476 --> 02:25.062
Oh, boy,
I would've killed for that job.

02:25.062 --> 02:28.899
I appreciate your support
and enthusiasm, Mom. I really do.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.734
I love you.
I'm gonna go set my stuff down.

02:30.734 --> 02:31.818
Okay.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.654
- It's lilies.
- What?

02:33.654 --> 02:35.781
The flowers for a funeral.
They're--

02:35.781 --> 02:37.032
Oh, lilies.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.118
I'm so...
I'm so glad you're home.

02:40.744 --> 02:41.870
Me too.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.296
He really loved you.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.173
Who?

03:35.132 --> 03:36.550
Your father.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.138
I know. I...

03:41.138 --> 03:42.389
Yeah, I know.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.894
How's the eulogy coming, hon?

03:47.603 --> 03:51.440
It is one of the most
beautiful things I've never written.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.318
Just say five things
you loved about your father.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.778
Mama, it's... it's not a grocery list.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.072
Just five... five things.

04:00.282 --> 04:01.366
Simple.

04:01.366 --> 04:02.701
From the heart.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.204
You're gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.582
We're here to honor

04:08.582 --> 04:11.752
the prestigious,
generous Andrew Bloom.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.214
Deeply beloved mayor
of this fair town.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.427
Husband of the highly adored
Jenny Bloom.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.556
And father to
the wonderful and sweet Lily.

04:24.556 --> 04:27.184
Lily, come on up
to the stage, darling.

04:35.943 --> 04:38.237
Hello.
Thank you all for joining us.

04:40.322 --> 04:44.368
In honor of my father's life,
I would like to share with you

04:44.368 --> 04:46.828
the... the five things that
I love most about him.

04:54.920 --> 04:55.921
He...

05:15.357 --> 05:16.525
I'm sorry.

06:52.538 --> 06:53.997
It's a strong chair.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.041
Is it?

06:59.419 --> 07:00.629
I'm... I'm sorry.

07:01.713 --> 07:02.965
It's... It's been a day.

07:07.803 --> 07:09.555
Will you please
get down from there?

07:10.389 --> 07:12.850
I'm... I'm good. Thanks.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.935
It's making me nervous
sitting so close to the edge.

07:17.729 --> 07:18.939
Please?

07:22.693 --> 07:24.194
Cherry on top?

07:26.822 --> 07:28.031
I'm okay.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.534
You gotta be--

07:50.762 --> 07:53.056
I once read that
maraschino cherries

07:53.056 --> 07:55.434
stay in your stomach
for, like, seven years.

07:55.434 --> 07:57.895
Or cause cancer. I forget which.

08:01.231 --> 08:03.483
I didn't know that
about maraschino cherries.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.612
Yeah, I may have made that up,

08:07.946 --> 08:09.114
but they're pretty gross.

08:09.114 --> 08:10.908
Yeah, they're definitely gross.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.659
So, what happened?

08:13.535 --> 08:14.536
Sorry?

08:15.412 --> 08:17.915
What was that over--
I didn't mean to, but...

08:20.459 --> 08:21.585
Was it a woman?

08:22.252 --> 08:23.253
Or man? I--

08:25.464 --> 08:26.924
It was a chair, wasn't it?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.010
Yes.

08:32.221 --> 08:33.597
So, what floor you live on?

08:33.597 --> 08:34.765
You first.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.227
Top floor, right next to
my sister and her husband.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.897
What do you do for a living?

08:42.563 --> 08:43.607
Neurosurgeon.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.654
Is that funny?

08:49.780 --> 08:51.865
- Jesus. You're serious.
- Yeah.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.743
- Really?
- Wow.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.912
Oh, my God.
Please. I'm so sorry.

08:56.912 --> 08:59.873
No, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
You've spent way too--

09:00.707 --> 09:01.792
I'm sorry.

09:01.792 --> 09:04.962
You've spent way too much time in school
to have me laughing like this.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.505
I'm terrible. I'm sorry.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.882
I... I thought you were a crypto bro.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.884
- You thought I was a crypto bro?
- No, no, no.

09:10.884 --> 09:11.969
Yeah, no, well, I don't know,

09:11.969 --> 09:13.762
or like
a really expensive prostitute.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.138
Well, I am expensive.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.432
You can forget about
kissing on the mouth.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.356
Why haven't I seen you before?

09:26.191 --> 09:28.861
Well, mostly because I've never
required brain surgery.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.697
But also
'cause I don't live here, so...

09:32.239 --> 09:33.907
So, you just
broke into my building?

09:33.907 --> 09:35.450
You have a really nice view.

09:36.702 --> 09:37.828
I do.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.793
What's your name?

09:45.627 --> 09:46.628
Lily.

09:47.713 --> 09:49.214
- You?
- Ryle.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.424
Ryle what?

09:50.841 --> 09:51.884
Kincaid.

09:51.884 --> 09:53.594
You just made that up just now.

09:53.594 --> 09:55.053
Why would I make up
my last name?

09:55.053 --> 09:56.972
- Well, I mean-- Fine.
- What's your last name?

09:57.890 --> 09:59.641
It's fine. We don't need to...
We don't need to do this.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.852
- I'm just asking your last name.
- It was really nice meeting you.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.187
- Thank you. Just be careful.
- Okay.

10:03.187 --> 10:05.522
It would be courteous
to give me back your last name.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.690
I'm not gonna stalk you.

10:06.690 --> 10:09.026
No, it's just really--
It's sort of embarrassing.

10:09.026 --> 10:10.110
What is it?

10:10.652 --> 10:11.820
Bloom.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.780
- Your name is Lily Bloom?
- Yes.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.240
It... It actually gets worse.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.242
- Yeah. Yeah, no. It... It does.
- No way. Not possible.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.327
Than Lily Bloom?

10:18.327 --> 10:19.494
I don't wanna talk about it,

10:19.494 --> 10:20.829
'cause it's really
kind of embarrassing.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.623
I'm obsessed with flowers. I--

10:23.498 --> 10:24.917
And I'm about to open
my first flower shop.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.001
Flower shop?

10:26.001 --> 10:27.628
Yeah, it's a lifelong dream,
so...

10:33.008 --> 10:35.594
Stop. I told you.

10:35.594 --> 10:38.055
No, Lily Bloom the florist.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.974
No, doesn't sound
made-up at all.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.893
Hey, you could always use your middle name

10:42.893 --> 10:44.269
if it doesn't work out.

10:46.939 --> 10:48.148
- No, Violet.
- Trust me.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.399
- Petunia.
- No, stop.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.484
Of the valley.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.654
- Toadflax.
- Blossom.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.489
Goddamn, your parents hate you.

10:55.614 --> 10:57.616
Well, I mean,
we may never know for sure,

10:57.616 --> 11:00.077
'cause my dad
died on Monday, so...

11:00.077 --> 11:01.870
Yeah, that's actually
why I came up here,

11:01.870 --> 11:03.956
to have a good cry and,

11:03.956 --> 11:05.791
hopefully,
meet a wealthy neurosurgeon.

11:06.959 --> 11:07.960
So...

11:09.795 --> 11:10.796
I'm sorry.

11:13.382 --> 11:15.676
I could've made it back,
you know,

11:15.676 --> 11:17.761
to see him before he died,
but I...

11:22.057 --> 11:23.058
I didn't.

11:25.853 --> 11:26.854
Damn.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.315
Yeah.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.070
Well, you know, naked truths
aren't always pretty.

11:46.123 --> 11:48.041
I watched
a little boy die tonight.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.794
He was only six years old.

11:51.128 --> 11:52.921
His brother found a gun
in his parents' bedroom,

11:52.921 --> 11:55.424
and it went off by accident.

11:56.925 --> 11:57.926
Tried everything.

12:02.264 --> 12:03.682
No one should have to--

12:05.184 --> 12:06.185
I can't imagine

12:06.185 --> 12:08.187
what that's gonna do
to that little boy who lived.

12:10.689 --> 12:13.817
Destroy him for life.
That's what it'll do.

12:18.906 --> 12:21.074
All right, give me another one.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.620
Naked truth. I like that.

12:27.331 --> 12:29.249
- Go on.
- Okay.

12:29.583 --> 12:31.877
I... I don't know...

12:36.882 --> 12:39.176
The first guy
I had sex with was homeless.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.260
Stop it.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.429
Yeah, no, really.
In high school, yeah.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.181
Tell me more.

12:44.181 --> 12:45.307
I actually think we're supposed to say

12:45.307 --> 12:47.476
"temporarily un-homed," or "displaced."

12:47.476 --> 12:48.560
I shouldn't have said--

12:48.560 --> 12:49.853
Now you're
avoiding the question.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.188
I'm not.
There's nothing to tell.

12:51.188 --> 12:52.314
I want the good stuff.

12:52.314 --> 12:54.274
Okay, I was friends with
this boy named Atlas.

12:54.274 --> 12:58.278
And he was
kind and incredibly capable

12:58.278 --> 13:00.864
and, you know,
he just got a shit hand.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.658
You're making me jealous
of a homeless man.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.243
Oh, my.

13:04.243 --> 13:06.245
Okay, that's enough. That's--

13:06.578 --> 13:07.788
Your turn.

13:07.788 --> 13:10.374
Oh, no, I think I'm done.
Can't top that.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.459
That was
both sexy and disturbing.

13:13.210 --> 13:15.712
Okay, just shock me. Say--
I mean, you can say anything.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.005
I wanna have sex with you.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.011
- What? I mean--
- You said to shock you.

13:23.846 --> 13:24.847
What?

13:29.351 --> 13:31.186
How many-- I'm sorry.

13:31.186 --> 13:33.313
How many women
has this worked on?

13:33.313 --> 13:34.857
I'm not a relationship person.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.608
- Yeah, I gathered that.
- Never been good at them.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.110
But how do you know

13:38.110 --> 13:40.529
if you've never tried
having a relationship or carbs?

13:40.529 --> 13:41.613
How do you know
it doesn't work for you?

13:41.613 --> 13:43.073
Carbs? I never said I didn't eat carbs.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.908
Come on, you don't look
like a reckless snacker.

13:44.908 --> 13:45.993
Well, thank you.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.412
Love isn't for me.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.873
Lust is nice though.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.252
- I feel like you're missing out.
- Am I?

13:57.713 --> 13:59.882
You haven't
answered my question.

13:59.882 --> 14:02.426
Forgot what the question was.

14:02.718 --> 14:04.678
How many women
has this worked on?

14:06.805 --> 14:08.015
All of them.

14:15.564 --> 14:16.815
Well, I...

14:18.442 --> 14:19.818
I can't-- I'm...

14:22.362 --> 14:23.906
I'm gonna have
to break your record.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.407
I'm the kind of girl
you take home to mama.

14:26.575 --> 14:27.618
How far would you go?

14:32.414 --> 14:34.791
I'm not sure.
I'm an unreliable narrator.

14:37.294 --> 14:38.545
You could try me.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.032
Too far?

15:08.534 --> 15:09.535
No.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.043
This?

15:18.919 --> 15:21.004
Depends what happens next.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.592
Shit.

15:29.471 --> 15:30.472
Yeah.

15:32.391 --> 15:33.809
No, I'm not supposed to--

15:37.312 --> 15:39.106
Okay, prep the OR. Tell Tom he's cutting.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.607
I'm gonna supervise.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.109
All right, I'll be there in ten.

15:45.279 --> 15:47.197
- Holy shit.
- I know. I'm sorry.

15:47.197 --> 15:50.784
No, I mean, holy shit.
I... I... I just now realized

15:50.784 --> 15:54.788
you're actually a neurosurgeon.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.915
- I tried to warn you.
- No, congratulations.

15:56.915 --> 15:58.667
- That's... That's amazing.
- Yeah.

15:59.835 --> 16:01.670
I-- This is-- You know, I--

16:03.547 --> 16:04.923
I'll see you around.

16:06.258 --> 16:07.342
Will you?

16:08.093 --> 16:09.428
No.

16:20.731 --> 16:23.859
It was nice meeting you, Lily Blossom Bloom.

16:24.318 --> 16:27.112
It was nice meeting you,
Ryle Siegfried Kincaid.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.240
I like that.

17:06.609 --> 17:07.611
Oh, shit.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.178
Thank you.

19:56.280 --> 19:57.281
Thank you.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.200
I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:17.092 --> 20:18.594
So, why are you at that house?

20:21.430 --> 20:22.764
My mom kicked me out.

20:23.682 --> 20:24.725
Why?

20:27.311 --> 20:28.312
Because...

20:29.479 --> 20:31.940
she likes dating guys
who beat the shit out of her.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.779
What happened to your hand?

20:38.071 --> 20:40.115
God, I can smell him from here.

20:42.451 --> 20:43.744
It got in the way.

20:49.041 --> 20:51.668
Look, my parents don't get
home from work till around 5:00,

20:51.668 --> 20:55.214
so if you wanna shower or...

20:55.214 --> 20:56.924
I don't know, wash clothes or--

20:56.924 --> 20:58.717
- I don't mind.
- Yeah.

20:59.676 --> 21:00.719
Sure.

21:02.513 --> 21:04.348
Your enthusiasm's contagious.

21:13.899 --> 21:15.609
<i>Did you feel the earthquake
this weekend?</i>

21:15.609 --> 21:16.693
<i>Yeah!</i>

21:16.693 --> 21:18.946
<i>- You did?
- Yeah!</i>

21:19.571 --> 21:20.572
Hey.

21:21.657 --> 21:22.908
Thanks for the clothes.

21:23.867 --> 21:24.910
Yeah, of course.

21:25.869 --> 21:27.079
My dad won't even
know they're gone.

21:27.079 --> 21:29.498
He doesn't usually
wear jeans much, so...

21:34.336 --> 21:37.506
My parents aren't gonna
be home for an hour or so,

21:37.506 --> 21:39.967
if you wanna watch TV
or something.

21:55.858 --> 21:58.277
So, what do you wanna do
after you graduate?

21:58.902 --> 22:02.573
I'm... signed up to go to
basic training in May.

22:02.573 --> 22:04.074
Basic training. What is--

22:05.659 --> 22:06.660
In the Marines.

22:08.620 --> 22:09.621
Wow.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.301
I'm sorry. I'm--

22:23.260 --> 22:25.262
I'm sorry.
It's just the... the clothes--

22:25.262 --> 22:26.346
My dad's clothes,

22:26.346 --> 22:28.140
they make you kind of
look like Ned Flanders a little.

22:31.435 --> 22:33.187
Your clothes kind of
make you look like a carrot.

22:33.187 --> 22:34.938
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

22:45.324 --> 22:46.617
- Mom...
<i>- If it doesn't work out--</i>

22:46.617 --> 22:48.327
Mom, you do know a challenge
only excites me.

22:48.327 --> 22:49.870
<i>I... I... I said, "If."</i>

22:49.870 --> 22:52.372
<i>"A flower sales statistic that
shocks many new store owners..."</i>

22:52.372 --> 22:54.208
Mom, what makes you think
it's not gonna work out?

22:54.208 --> 22:55.959
"...a whopping 45%
of all flowers die..."

22:55.959 --> 22:57.044
<i>Mom.</i>

22:57.044 --> 22:59.129
Mom, are you reading this
from Google?

22:59.129 --> 23:00.589
Of course I am.
How would I know that?

23:00.589 --> 23:02.883
I'm worried about you.
Google is worried about you.

23:02.883 --> 23:04.760
Well, you're both too late.
I'm picking up the keys now.

23:04.760 --> 23:05.886
<i>Okay, okay. Okay.</i>

23:05.886 --> 23:07.888
<i>- I love you. You can do this.</i>
- Wait. Sir! Sir! Hi.

23:07.888 --> 23:09.473
<i>- Make it bold and brave.</i>
- Okay, Mom.

23:09.473 --> 23:11.433
You sound crazy.
I'll talk to you later. Bye.

23:11.433 --> 23:13.519
Hi. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

23:13.519 --> 23:16.355
- I... I just moved here.
- Okay, sweetheart. Good luck.

23:19.399 --> 23:20.484
Thank you.

24:22.838 --> 24:23.881
Hi.

24:28.468 --> 24:29.761
- Hello.
- Hi.

24:30.262 --> 24:32.514
- Sorry. Hi. Yeah. I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

24:32.514 --> 24:34.057
I can't--

24:34.558 --> 24:35.934
- Oh, wait.
- I can't hear you. Hi.

24:36.852 --> 24:38.103
Hi. Can I help you?

24:38.103 --> 24:39.479
Can I help you?

24:39.479 --> 24:40.606
Excuse me?

24:40.606 --> 24:42.232
The "help wanted" sign
out front?

24:42.232 --> 24:43.650
You have a "help wanted" sign
out front.

24:43.650 --> 24:46.069
Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, I didn't... I didn't put that out there.

24:46.069 --> 24:48.530
- I just, yeah, got this place.
- I figured. It's pretty old.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.907
And I walk by this place
every day,

24:49.907 --> 24:51.491
and I'm just obsessed with it.

24:51.491 --> 24:52.910
I've always wanted
to see inside,

24:52.910 --> 24:55.746
and I was wondering, like,
"Who's gonna come along?"

24:55.746 --> 24:57.789
- And it's you, yeah?
- No, it's me. Yeah, hi.

24:57.789 --> 24:59.625
- Are you the owner?
- Yeah, I'm... I'm Lily.

24:59.625 --> 25:00.751
- Allysa.
- Nice to meet you.

25:00.751 --> 25:04.296
Sorry. Disgusting.
Hi. Nice to meet you. Yeah.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.674
Well, yeah,
are you looking for any help?

25:08.467 --> 25:10.219
Well, I'm not hiring just yet.

25:10.219 --> 25:12.179
I just... I just got the keys
a few days ago,

25:12.179 --> 25:13.263
and I'm still sort of, you know,

25:13.263 --> 25:16.266
figuring out
what I'm doing, so--

25:16.266 --> 25:19.228
May I just ask,
what is this place going to be?

25:19.228 --> 25:20.354
A flower shop.

25:23.732 --> 25:24.942
I'm so sorry.

25:25.901 --> 25:27.277
I have an issue with--

25:27.277 --> 25:29.988
My face says it all.
I just hate flowers.

25:29.988 --> 25:31.323
You hate flowers?

25:31.323 --> 25:32.699
- I do.
- Okay.

25:32.699 --> 25:35.077
Like, why don't you just
give me something that's living

25:35.077 --> 25:37.120
rather than something
that's on its way to dying?

25:37.120 --> 25:38.288
And then it's gonna create
more work for me,

25:38.288 --> 25:39.748
and I'm gonna
have to deal with that,

25:39.748 --> 25:42.459
but again,
it's a solo perspective.

25:42.459 --> 25:45.504
It's-- I find flower shops
depressing. It's just me.

25:45.504 --> 25:47.256
I do wish you luck.
I'm so sorry.

25:47.256 --> 25:49.258
I agree. I find them depressing.

25:49.258 --> 25:50.843
Because I feel like...

25:51.552 --> 25:54.221
I don't know, it's like
the beauty of what a flower is--

25:54.221 --> 25:55.305
This is ridiculous.

25:55.305 --> 25:59.017
The beauty of what a flower is
has been lost, right? It's... It's...

25:59.685 --> 26:01.520
It's like we order them
like takeout now-- It's... It's...

26:01.520 --> 26:02.604
- Yes.
- Right?

26:02.604 --> 26:04.147
It's what you're talking about.

26:04.147 --> 26:07.234
It's highlighting the pain
and the tension and the--

26:08.235 --> 26:09.820
You know,
the fact that it's fleeting

26:09.820 --> 26:11.321
and it's storytelling and--

26:11.780 --> 26:12.781
I don't know,

26:12.781 --> 26:14.283
that's actually what I find
beautiful about it, and--

26:14.283 --> 26:15.909
That's what I'm
trying to do here, so--

26:15.909 --> 26:18.537
That's absolutely beautiful. I'm--

26:18.537 --> 26:22.165
If that's what you're doing,
yeah, sign me up. Wonderful.

26:22.165 --> 26:23.500
Thanks, thanks.

26:24.042 --> 26:25.169
Well...

26:25.711 --> 26:27.504
Yeah, I really do
wish you the best...

26:27.504 --> 26:28.630
Thank you.

26:29.548 --> 26:32.092
...and I'll just be lurking
around in the neighborhood.

26:32.092 --> 26:33.594
Hopefully, I made
my first customer.

26:33.594 --> 26:36.388
- Yeah. Yeah. Great. It's so gorgeous.
- Hope to see you--

26:36.388 --> 26:38.182
Yeah. Bye.

26:39.975 --> 26:41.059
Hey, I...

26:42.352 --> 26:43.770
I don't know, this--

26:44.938 --> 26:47.274
I do need help.
Do you want a job?

26:47.274 --> 26:48.984
This is exactly what I wanted

26:48.984 --> 26:50.319
to happen to me
when I walked in here.

26:50.944 --> 26:53.071
- Yes.
- Oh, God. Okay.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.489
- Wonderful. Great.
- Okay.

26:54.489 --> 26:55.699
I have to be out
by 5:00 p.m. tonight.

26:55.699 --> 26:56.783
I do have a dinner.

26:56.783 --> 26:58.118
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

26:59.828 --> 27:01.038
I just started working here.

27:01.580 --> 27:03.290
- Okay, perfect.
- Great.

27:03.290 --> 27:05.334
I'm gonna just need to wipe off
a surface for this girl.

27:05.334 --> 27:06.627
Here. There you go.

27:06.627 --> 27:08.837
- That's--
- Thank you so much.

27:08.837 --> 27:11.256
It's a real <i>Ghostbusters</i>
situation in here, huh?

27:14.426 --> 27:16.011
Hey. Frame it.

27:18.514 --> 27:19.765
Did you see that?

27:20.974 --> 27:22.476
Oh, my God. It's still attached.

27:22.476 --> 27:24.019
Oh, God, I can't watch.

27:29.816 --> 27:31.318
Yeah. Yeah.

27:50.754 --> 27:55.759
You're like Dr. Frankenstein,
but with flowers.

27:56.260 --> 27:58.470
Okay. No, no, no.
We got it. We got it. We got it.

27:58.595 --> 28:00.264
I don't have it. Hold on.

28:00.264 --> 28:02.349
- Okay, here. Here we go.
- Hold on. My husband's calling.

28:02.349 --> 28:03.517
Can I ask him to help us?

28:03.517 --> 28:04.810
- Yes. No, please. Genius.
- Or is that weak?

28:04.810 --> 28:06.103
- You got it?
- Nope.

28:06.103 --> 28:07.312
- <i>Babe.
- </i>  Not at all.

28:07.312 --> 28:09.147
<i>- Babe, the game's over. Where you at?
- </i>  Hi, honey<i>. Sweetheart.</i>

28:09.147 --> 28:10.858
<i>- Where are you?</i>
- I'm at the shop with my boss.

28:10.858 --> 28:12.609
And we need some help
hanging something up.

28:12.609 --> 28:13.735
<i>I don't like
when you say "boss."</i>

28:13.735 --> 28:14.820
- Babe.
<i>- You should be the boss.</i>

28:14.820 --> 28:16.613
<i>Let's buy the place
and make you the boss.</i>

28:16.613 --> 28:17.990
Honey, you're on speaker.

28:17.990 --> 28:19.241
- Yeah. Just--
<i>- Hi.</i>

28:19.241 --> 28:20.325
- Just--
- Hi.

28:20.325 --> 28:22.661
I want you to know that they're
gonna be wearing onesies.

28:22.661 --> 28:23.787
Because the bar gives free beer
to the people...

28:23.787 --> 28:24.872
<i>I can see you.</i>

28:24.872 --> 28:26.331
...who wear onesies
to the Bruins game,

28:26.331 --> 28:27.624
but they don't always wear that.

28:27.624 --> 28:29.418
<i>- I'm across the street.</i>
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

28:29.418 --> 28:31.420
<i>Oh, my God,
babe, you are stunning.</i>

28:31.420 --> 28:32.921
Can you bring my brother in too?

28:32.921 --> 28:34.673
Okay, I can't take responsibility

28:34.673 --> 28:35.757
for either of the people

28:35.757 --> 28:37.718
who are about to come in here,
just so you know.

28:38.760 --> 28:39.887
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:41.597 --> 28:42.723
You look great.

28:42.723 --> 28:44.850
- This is Lily.
- Hi. Lily. Hi. Nice to meet you.

28:44.850 --> 28:47.060
- This is my husband, Marshall.
- I didn't mean the boss thing.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.395
That's my brother Ryle.

28:56.778 --> 28:58.197
Hi. Hi.

28:58.864 --> 28:59.865
- Hi.
- Lily.

28:59.865 --> 29:01.200
Lily Bloom.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.409
Yes. Yes.

29:02.868 --> 29:04.745
- You guys know each other?
- No.

29:04.745 --> 29:06.079
- A little bit.
- No, we--

29:06.079 --> 29:07.706
We met a few months ago.

29:07.706 --> 29:10.083
We shared each other's
naked truths.

29:10.792 --> 29:12.002
- That's-- Okay.
- No, that's--

29:12.002 --> 29:13.086
We're adults.

29:13.086 --> 29:14.922
- That was a bad choice of words.
- You said it.

29:14.922 --> 29:17.007
You said "naked truths" first.

29:17.007 --> 29:19.134
- No, we just talked.
- You're lying.

29:19.134 --> 29:21.053
That's what we're calling it
these days, "We talked"?

29:21.053 --> 29:23.138
- 'Cause we talk all the time.
- Great.

29:23.138 --> 29:24.431
We talk, like...
We talk, like, three to five times a week.

29:24.431 --> 29:25.516
Wonderful.

29:25.516 --> 29:27.518
Can I show you
the work that I've done here?

29:27.518 --> 29:28.602
We should talk?
We can talk tonight.

29:28.602 --> 29:29.811
No, we could hang this.

29:29.811 --> 29:30.938
No, let me take you over here.

29:30.938 --> 29:32.022
Let me talk to your sister
over here.

29:33.106 --> 29:34.983
- Okay.
- I mean, it is really good.

29:38.612 --> 29:39.613
We meet again.

29:40.447 --> 29:41.490
It's good to see you.

29:42.866 --> 29:44.076
So, this is the flower shop

29:44.076 --> 29:46.495
that my sister works at
'cause she's bored, huh?

29:46.495 --> 29:49.331
We like to say "inspired" here,

29:49.998 --> 29:51.792
but, yeah, this is--

29:51.792 --> 29:53.502
You know, I-- Yeah.

29:55.045 --> 29:56.046
Yeah.

29:58.215 --> 29:59.675
Looks like we will be seeing

29:59.925 --> 30:01.593
a little more of
each other then.

30:01.593 --> 30:03.011
Is that so?

30:03.011 --> 30:04.388
Babe, these are incredible.

30:04.388 --> 30:05.973
Thank you very much.

30:07.599 --> 30:09.726
You're even more terrifying
in the daytime.

30:09.726 --> 30:10.894
Same.

30:10.894 --> 30:12.604
Okay, guys, idea.

30:14.523 --> 30:16.149
Let's go have
some dumb fun today.

30:27.327 --> 30:28.537
I've gone up
to the roof a few times.

30:28.537 --> 30:30.122
Hoping you might be up there.

30:31.999 --> 30:33.292
<i>I wanna see you again.</i>

30:39.089 --> 30:40.424
Well, now you see me.

30:42.217 --> 30:43.302
You know what I mean.

30:46.889 --> 30:47.973
Okay. Let's go, let's go.

30:49.683 --> 30:51.560
But that's a bad idea, right?

30:51.560 --> 30:54.313
Because of my sister,
because of your business.

30:54.313 --> 30:55.731
Go, Lily!

30:55.731 --> 30:57.232
Yeah, that's a bad idea.

30:57.983 --> 30:59.776
Yep. Of course.
This is you right here, babe.

31:05.532 --> 31:07.242
No. Hey.

31:07.242 --> 31:08.952
She's off-limits.
No, she's mine.

31:08.952 --> 31:10.037
I see you.

31:10.037 --> 31:12.080
- Hey.
- It's true.

31:12.497 --> 31:13.832
So, we'll just be friends then?

31:14.291 --> 31:15.417
I like it.

31:18.420 --> 31:19.421
Yeah, friends.

31:23.383 --> 31:24.635
- To friendship.
- Yeah.

31:27.930 --> 31:30.057
It's the weekend somewhere.
Let's go.

31:30.057 --> 31:32.309
Oh, no. Please don't leave, sir.
Our Uber's about to leave.

31:32.309 --> 31:33.894
I love you.
I'm gonna head home, honey.

31:33.894 --> 31:35.771
No. no, no. It's brunch in Singapore.
Come on, Lily.

31:35.771 --> 31:37.564
- Let me walk you home.
- No, it's fine.

31:37.564 --> 31:39.483
- I... I live around the corner.
- It's on the way.

31:39.483 --> 31:41.944
- You live where we live.
- Semantics.

31:41.944 --> 31:43.028
Okay, fine, but only 'cause

31:43.028 --> 31:44.446
you'd feel really bad
if I got murdered.

31:44.446 --> 31:46.698
Okay, don't fish
where I swim, Ryle.

31:46.698 --> 31:48.450
I love you.
See you tomorrow, Lil.

31:49.743 --> 31:51.495
I appreciate you walking me,
but you really didn't--

31:51.495 --> 31:53.038
I can't stop thinking about you.

31:54.164 --> 31:55.624
I'm right here.

31:57.584 --> 31:59.545
Well, that's the problem.

32:01.797 --> 32:03.799
I thought we agreed
to be friends.

32:04.258 --> 32:05.259
We did.

32:06.468 --> 32:08.136
But that was, like, hours ago.

32:11.348 --> 32:12.349
Can I just kiss you?

32:12.349 --> 32:15.310
- Oh, my God. You are pushy.
- Just once. Just once.

32:15.310 --> 32:17.229
That's all I need
to get you out of my system.

32:17.229 --> 32:18.730
- That's it? That'll do it?
- One kiss.

32:18.730 --> 32:20.858
Okay, well, good luck with that.

32:20.858 --> 32:21.942
Is that a yes?

32:23.735 --> 32:24.736
Just once?

32:25.779 --> 32:26.780
Just once.

32:32.327 --> 32:33.328
Okay.

32:38.166 --> 32:39.168
Okay.

33:01.064 --> 33:02.816
Did that get me
out of your system?

33:05.903 --> 33:08.071
I'm gonna walk
myself home, okay?

33:09.156 --> 33:10.157
Bye, friend.

33:23.629 --> 33:25.088
<i>- Is this enough over here?
- Yeah.</i>

33:25.088 --> 33:26.173
Maybe add, like,
a little right there.

33:26.173 --> 33:27.257
Okay.

33:27.257 --> 33:28.759
You're just protecting the roots,
you know, from the snow

33:28.884 --> 33:31.261
or in case it freezes over or anything.

33:31.762 --> 33:33.972
I mean, the roots are the most
important part of the plant.

33:34.097 --> 33:35.516
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:35.933 --> 33:37.684
I didn't know that about roots.
That's cool.

33:38.769 --> 33:39.770
Here, you want some?

33:42.439 --> 33:44.191
Thank you. Yeah, I'll take that.

33:44.691 --> 33:46.443
What made you wanna
start growing things?

33:46.860 --> 33:49.738
When I take really good care
of these plants,

33:49.738 --> 33:52.658
they reward me
with flowers and vegetables.

33:52.658 --> 33:55.577
And when I don't,
they just shrivel up and die.

33:56.745 --> 33:57.788
Kinda like us.

34:08.507 --> 34:10.007
What about that oak tree?

34:11.134 --> 34:12.719
It doesn't need anybody to grow.

34:13.344 --> 34:15.429
Because it's capable
of taking care of itself.

34:16.723 --> 34:18.600
No matter what,
it will keep standing.

34:19.309 --> 34:20.893
Strong and sturdy...

34:23.313 --> 34:26.483
and yeah, it survives
because it's a goddamn oak tree.

34:54.844 --> 34:56.179
You embarrassed me.

34:56.804 --> 34:59.391
- You like the attention.
- Lily's asleep upstairs.

35:00.684 --> 35:03.437
Honey, please. Please, don't!

35:04.688 --> 35:06.523
I heard what happened
last night...

35:08.150 --> 35:10.402
with your dad and your mom.

35:13.030 --> 35:14.239
I don't-- Okay, yeah.

35:15.490 --> 35:16.950
Does that happen a lot?

35:30.881 --> 35:32.174
I'm sorry.

35:49.149 --> 35:50.317
Hey, Lily.

35:51.276 --> 35:52.903
Do you wanna do the honors?

35:52.903 --> 35:55.656
No. You go ahead.
I wanna take it in from here.

35:56.323 --> 35:58.200
I was hoping you'd say that.
Okay.

36:00.786 --> 36:02.496
Okay.

36:02.496 --> 36:03.622
Hold on!

36:06.333 --> 36:08.627
Oh, my God.

36:09.378 --> 36:11.630
- This is insane.
- Congratulations.

36:11.630 --> 36:13.590
I couldn't have
done it without you.

36:13.590 --> 36:14.675
Oh, my gosh.

36:14.675 --> 36:17.219
I don't know what
I was thinking. Thank God.

36:18.011 --> 36:19.179
It's incredible.

36:19.179 --> 36:22.558
It's perfect. It's you.
It's perfect. It's great.

36:22.558 --> 36:24.309
What if we don't
get any customers?

36:24.309 --> 36:26.311
No, don't do that.
Your mom's coming.

36:26.311 --> 36:27.396
Oh, my mom.

36:27.396 --> 36:28.564
She's flying in
to be a customer.

36:28.564 --> 36:30.732
Yeah, I mean-- Yeah, but how
depressing would that be

36:30.732 --> 36:32.901
if the only customer
we have is my mom?

36:32.901 --> 36:34.444
Well, Marshall's coming
this afternoon.

36:34.570 --> 36:36.280
So that's two, so you're good.

36:39.700 --> 36:41.493
Okay, here we go.

36:42.870 --> 36:44.538
- Wow.
- Yeah.

36:44.538 --> 36:47.666
This doesn't even look like
the same shop. Congratulations.

36:47.666 --> 36:49.001
How's it going so far?

36:49.459 --> 36:51.587
I mean, we literally
just opened, but--

36:51.587 --> 36:55.465
So, that means your brother's
the first official customer?

36:55.465 --> 36:57.801
You have to buy something
to be considered a customer.

36:57.926 --> 36:59.761
Right now you're just loitering.

37:00.429 --> 37:01.638
Good morning, Lily.

37:01.638 --> 37:02.890
Good morning.

37:03.265 --> 37:05.684
All right. I'll take these.

37:06.768 --> 37:08.353
Do you deliver?

37:08.937 --> 37:12.441
- Is that for a girl?
- It is.

37:12.441 --> 37:14.234
She might send them back,
knowing her.

37:15.402 --> 37:17.112
Right. Okay.

37:17.112 --> 37:19.156
That little card, fill out
the message on the front

37:19.156 --> 37:21.241
and then the back you put the
person's name and the address.

37:21.241 --> 37:22.367
Okay.

37:22.367 --> 37:23.869
So, are you bringing
this mystery girl

37:23.869 --> 37:25.245
to my birthday party on Friday?

37:25.245 --> 37:28.040
'Cause I kind of, like, need to
plan for that sort of thing.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.334
I don't know.
Are you going, Lily?

37:31.668 --> 37:32.669
Yeah, of course.

37:32.669 --> 37:33.921
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

37:33.921 --> 37:35.797
She has to go.
She's my best friend.

37:37.799 --> 37:39.718
- All right.
- Thank you.

37:41.637 --> 37:44.598
- What do I owe you?
- Fifty-one even.

37:45.432 --> 37:46.850
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

37:46.850 --> 37:48.352
- This is a big moment.
- Sure is.

37:48.352 --> 37:51.772
Thank you so much
for your service-- business.

37:53.232 --> 37:54.233
Thank you. Yeah.

37:54.525 --> 37:56.276
Hey, congrats.

37:56.276 --> 37:57.986
Get out. Thank you.

37:57.986 --> 38:00.155
- Good to see you.
- Bye.

38:00.155 --> 38:01.365
Goodbye.

38:02.574 --> 38:05.827
Oh, my God. He's such a dumbass.

38:05.827 --> 38:10.415
He put the name of our shop
as the delivery address.

38:11.708 --> 38:13.043
Weird first customer.

38:43.323 --> 38:44.324
Lily.

38:45.409 --> 38:47.452
- Hello. Happy birthday.
- Oh, my goodness.

38:47.452 --> 38:49.788
- You came. You look great.
- I missed something important.

38:49.788 --> 38:52.207
This is my-- It's a long story.

38:52.207 --> 38:53.750
Welcome to our casa.

38:53.750 --> 38:55.669
You guys, this-- I mean, your house--
This is...

38:55.669 --> 38:58.172
- I can't believe this is your house.
- This is our humble abode.

38:58.172 --> 39:00.424
I just wanted to do something low-key
for baby girl over here.

39:00.424 --> 39:01.508
Oh, my God.

39:02.384 --> 39:04.678
And to think I did not even
marry him for the money.

39:04.678 --> 39:06.263
- You're not in it for the money.
- I'm not.

39:06.263 --> 39:07.639
- You're my ride or die.
- Yeah.

39:07.639 --> 39:10.517
When we first met I was dead broke,
and I was driving a Toyota Camry.

39:10.517 --> 39:12.811
You still drive a Toyota Camry though.
Right?

39:12.811 --> 39:15.189
- The greatest automobile on earth.
- Yes, he does. Also...

39:15.189 --> 39:16.899
Can't convince me otherwise.

39:16.899 --> 39:18.692
He thinks it makes him relatable.

39:18.692 --> 39:21.278
- It really does.
- I'm a man of the people, okay?

39:21.278 --> 39:22.988
Happy birthday. I'm gonna go grab a drink.

39:22.988 --> 39:24.823
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, thank you. Okay.

39:25.282 --> 39:27.701
Yeah, you are a man of the people.

39:39.171 --> 39:40.506
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:43.342 --> 39:44.676
You didn't like the flowers?

39:44.676 --> 39:46.053
Stop flirting with me.

39:47.012 --> 39:49.223
Hi, may I have a scotch please? Thank you.

39:49.932 --> 39:51.350
I can't do that.

39:55.062 --> 39:56.355
I thought we were friends.

39:56.355 --> 39:57.439
We are friends.

40:00.776 --> 40:02.027
Okay.

40:02.027 --> 40:04.446
Excuse me. You're on my hand. Thank you.

40:17.334 --> 40:18.544
- Hi.
- Come on.

40:18.544 --> 40:20.587
- What?
- What are you doing?

40:22.130 --> 40:23.131
Nothing.

40:23.131 --> 40:25.884
You gotta... You gotta stop.
You have to stop this.

40:27.135 --> 40:28.428
- Please.
- What?

40:28.428 --> 40:32.266
Just the, you know, staring at me
like that and the--

40:32.266 --> 40:33.392
I'm just looking at you.

40:33.392 --> 40:35.727
Okay. You're just looking at me.

40:35.727 --> 40:37.354
Stop showing up at my flower shop

40:37.354 --> 40:39.189
- and sending me flowers.
- My sister works there.

40:39.189 --> 40:42.067
Stop walking through this party,
following me around.

40:42.067 --> 40:44.570
- You're making me feel like--
- Can you just shut up for one second?

40:46.154 --> 40:47.155
Okay.

40:48.448 --> 40:49.449
I like you.

40:49.449 --> 40:51.159
What, are you five?

40:54.663 --> 40:56.206
I'm trying here.

40:57.332 --> 40:58.333
Go on.

41:09.511 --> 41:11.430
Do you wanna go somewhere more private?

41:13.307 --> 41:14.349
To talk?

41:17.811 --> 41:18.854
To talk.

41:20.063 --> 41:21.064
Okay.

41:41.418 --> 41:43.253
No. No, no, no, stop.

41:44.838 --> 41:46.006
You want me to stop?

41:48.675 --> 41:49.885
No.

41:51.345 --> 41:52.429
No.

41:54.806 --> 41:57.267
But yes. I don't wanna have sex.
Not tonight.

41:58.644 --> 41:59.853
I know, I know.

41:59.853 --> 42:04.149
But I don't do casual,
and I know that's how you do it,

42:04.149 --> 42:07.194
but I've changed my mind.
And I'm sorry.

42:08.070 --> 42:09.655
I can't do this.

42:18.705 --> 42:20.749
You okay? What are you doing?

42:21.917 --> 42:23.335
Getting ready for bed.

42:23.335 --> 42:24.837
We're going to sleep.

42:25.587 --> 42:27.840
Sorry, we're what?

42:29.258 --> 42:30.342
Going to sleep.

42:32.302 --> 42:33.720
My God.

42:35.472 --> 42:36.473
Do you mind?

42:41.478 --> 42:43.105
Well, do you have something I can wear?

43:27.065 --> 43:29.193
I don't think you've
ever done this before.

43:29.193 --> 43:30.694
It was sexier in my head.

43:35.532 --> 43:36.533
Pants?

43:58.055 --> 43:59.306
You've got it.

44:08.315 --> 44:09.316
Smart-ass.

44:24.081 --> 44:25.749
Good night, Lily Bloom.

44:49.398 --> 44:52.317
Ryle, I'm very nice,
so I brought you coffee.

44:54.903 --> 44:56.572
- Hi.
- No.

44:57.114 --> 44:58.657
Oh, no.

44:59.491 --> 45:02.327
I understand. It's not as bad as it looks.

45:02.327 --> 45:04.246
- It looks pretty bad.
- It kind of is.

45:04.246 --> 45:07.583
Okay. None of my business. Okay.

45:08.792 --> 45:11.003
What-- I'm... I'm gonna go.

45:12.129 --> 45:13.672
Let me just say one thing.

45:14.173 --> 45:17.718
This man runs through women like candy.

45:17.718 --> 45:19.720
- This is different.
- Is it? Wonderful.

45:19.720 --> 45:21.889
Well, just in case it obviously is not,

45:21.889 --> 45:26.476
let me say that if you're looking for
nothing from him, that's a great option.

45:26.476 --> 45:27.561
Okay.

45:27.561 --> 45:30.939
But if you're looking for romance
and you want a relationship,

45:30.939 --> 45:33.442
this is not the person,
and it's not about you.

45:33.442 --> 45:34.526
And I love you.

45:34.526 --> 45:35.861
- Yeah.
- But let me just say--

45:35.861 --> 45:36.945
Date me.

45:38.655 --> 45:39.656
What?

45:40.282 --> 45:41.283
Date me.

45:41.783 --> 45:42.993
I've-- I don't--

45:45.829 --> 45:47.664
What... What does that mean? I--

45:47.664 --> 45:50.000
Okay, no. I'm gonna leave.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.880
And I'm so sorry,
but I was just bringing coffee,

45:54.880 --> 45:57.841
and now, I'm so embarrassed.

45:58.509 --> 45:59.635
You can't have any of that.

45:59.635 --> 46:01.053
That's for you.

46:01.053 --> 46:02.804
I'm outta here.

46:02.804 --> 46:06.141
A normal person would just leave
and go to therapy.

46:08.894 --> 46:10.771
What are you talking about?

46:12.064 --> 46:13.065
<i>I wanna try.</i>

46:19.905 --> 46:21.406
<i>I wanna try.</i>

46:25.327 --> 46:26.870
<i>Come on. You think you can do this?</i>

46:35.087 --> 46:36.463
<i>I have no idea.</i>

46:44.221 --> 46:46.098
<i>But I definitely wanna kiss you again.</i>

46:47.349 --> 46:48.517
<i>Well, that I can do.</i>

46:52.896 --> 46:53.897
<i>Okay.</i>

46:54.773 --> 46:56.400
<i>But don't make me regret this.</i>

48:31.537 --> 48:32.538
Hey.

48:41.088 --> 48:42.089
Good morning.

48:46.426 --> 48:48.971
You've already brushed your teeth.
That's not fair.

48:50.681 --> 48:52.474
So sorry. I gotta go in early.

48:52.933 --> 48:54.268
Am I gonna see you tonight?

48:58.063 --> 49:00.649
No. Not tonight. My mom's in town.

49:00.649 --> 49:03.235
She's obsessed with trying
this new restaurant, Root.

49:03.235 --> 49:05.195
It's her dying wish to take me there.

49:05.195 --> 49:06.405
Your mom's in town?

49:07.072 --> 49:10.576
Yeah. Yeah, no, she's not actually dying.

49:10.576 --> 49:13.954
- It's-- I was just saying that.
- It's just, you didn't...

49:15.122 --> 49:16.123
You didn't tell me that.

49:18.876 --> 49:21.211
I'm sorry.
I didn't think you'd wanna know.

49:21.587 --> 49:23.547
Is there room for one more?

49:25.841 --> 49:26.842
What?

49:26.967 --> 49:28.719
Wait, you wanna meet my mom?

49:28.719 --> 49:29.803
Is that a problem?

49:29.803 --> 49:32.181
I mean, I don't think it's a good idea.

49:33.807 --> 49:35.350
- Ouch.
- No.

49:35.893 --> 49:37.102
No. I mean--

49:38.103 --> 49:39.730
It's not because of you.

49:39.730 --> 49:41.481
It is because of her. This woman--

49:41.481 --> 49:44.067
I just wanna meet the mother
of the woman I love.

50:02.377 --> 50:03.545
Hey!

50:03.545 --> 50:07.257
Hey. Sorry, you forgot this. Bye.

50:08.967 --> 50:10.552
Wait, wait, this isn't mine.

50:11.220 --> 50:12.387
I know.

50:14.640 --> 50:16.600
I happen to love you too.

50:25.108 --> 50:26.777
You're gonna be late.

50:26.777 --> 50:29.029
Get over me, my gosh!

50:29.863 --> 50:30.948
I'm taken!

50:53.303 --> 50:54.346
Did you make this?

50:54.972 --> 50:55.973
Yeah.

50:56.974 --> 50:59.309
Carved it from a branch
from your old oak tree.

51:00.060 --> 51:01.395
In case you forget.

51:03.564 --> 51:04.731
Strong and sturdy.

51:08.193 --> 51:09.194
Thank you.

51:21.707 --> 51:24.543
Gross. I bet she has rabies now.

51:30.007 --> 51:31.008
Get up.

51:32.259 --> 51:34.469
- Get up. Get up. Get up.
- Stop. No, no.

51:35.220 --> 51:36.221
Come on.

51:56.200 --> 51:57.201
Do you like to cook?

51:57.201 --> 51:59.036
Yeah. I love it.

51:59.036 --> 52:01.330
Necessity is the mother of invention.

52:03.081 --> 52:04.499
Smells great. What is it?

52:04.499 --> 52:08.170
Hot chocolate cookies.
Dark chocolate with burnt marshmallows.

52:08.962 --> 52:09.963
That's good.

52:09.963 --> 52:13.300
My mom would splurge on
Swiss Miss for us at Christmas.

52:13.425 --> 52:14.593
That was her favorite.

52:21.433 --> 52:26.063
So, did you... did you kiss me earlier
because you really wanted to,

52:26.647 --> 52:29.650
or was it mostly just to
get back at Katie?

52:32.528 --> 52:33.612
I just--

52:34.947 --> 52:36.949
I really need some clarity here.

52:45.749 --> 52:46.875
I wanted to.

53:01.640 --> 53:02.641
That's my dad.

53:02.641 --> 53:04.101
- That is my dad. You have to go.
- What?

53:04.101 --> 53:06.270
- You... You have to go right now.
- Don't forget the cookies.

53:06.270 --> 53:07.813
Okay. Okay. I got it. You gotta go right now.

53:07.813 --> 53:09.648
- Out the back door. Please, go.
- Twelve minutes, okay?

53:09.648 --> 53:11.108
- Go, go, go.
- Okay.

53:16.446 --> 53:17.990
- Hey!
- Hi!

53:17.990 --> 53:19.408
- How are you, honey?
- Good.

53:19.408 --> 53:21.243
- You all right? How was your day? Good?
- Yeah.

53:21.243 --> 53:22.327
Yeah, great.

53:22.327 --> 53:23.954
Good. Busy?

53:23.954 --> 53:25.247
Yeah...

53:25.998 --> 53:26.999
Busy's good.

53:31.587 --> 53:32.838
I made cookies.

53:34.131 --> 53:35.132
Yep.

53:35.132 --> 53:36.967
- Yeah, I'm starting to--
- Wow.

53:37.676 --> 53:38.677
Pigs are flying.

53:38.677 --> 53:39.761
Yeah.

53:41.096 --> 53:42.514
Wish I didn't love you so much.

53:42.514 --> 53:43.891
Yeah, same.

53:44.766 --> 53:46.143
Okay. You gonna save me some?

53:46.143 --> 53:47.436
- Yeah, of course.
- You promise?

53:47.436 --> 53:48.979
Yeah, I promise you.

53:52.691 --> 53:55.068
- My goodness.
- Yeah, it's amazing.

53:55.068 --> 53:56.612
- Hi. We're just meeting her.
- Yeah, sure.

53:56.612 --> 53:59.198
- Yeah. I am sorry in advance.
- No.

53:59.198 --> 54:00.449
Yeah, no, no. Prepare yourself.

54:00.449 --> 54:01.533
Hi! Hi, Mama!

54:01.658 --> 54:04.244
- I love this place!
- It's beautiful, right?

54:04.244 --> 54:06.205
Oh, my God! It looks beautiful.

54:06.205 --> 54:08.415
- Let's order cocktails.
- Let's. Yes. Yeah.

54:08.415 --> 54:09.541
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:09.541 --> 54:13.837
Mom, this is... this is my friend, Ryle,
yeah, who I now sleep with. So--

54:14.755 --> 54:17.591
- Ryle Kincaid. Nice to meet you, ma'am.
- It's so nice to meet you.

54:17.591 --> 54:20.010
- You know you said that out loud?
- I do know I said that out loud.

54:20.010 --> 54:21.970
Allysa, you know, who I work with?

54:21.970 --> 54:23.180
This is her brother.

54:23.180 --> 54:25.766
- Yes! Now I see a resemblance, sure.
- Yeah.

54:25.766 --> 54:29.228
- Well, we both favor our mother.
- Here it goes.

54:29.228 --> 54:31.772
That's what everybody says
about me and Lily.

54:31.772 --> 54:33.440
You know, I see it.

54:33.440 --> 54:34.525
Yes.

54:34.525 --> 54:36.652
The apple does not fall far from the tree.

54:36.652 --> 54:39.613
- How lucky are you, Lily?
- The luckiest.

54:39.613 --> 54:40.989
How lucky am I?

54:40.989 --> 54:42.407
Oh, my God.

54:42.407 --> 54:45.827
Would you excuse me? I have a thing.
I like to wash my hands a lot and--

54:45.827 --> 54:47.246
- Give me one--
- Get out of here.

54:47.246 --> 54:48.622
- I will. All right. All right. Bye-bye.
- Leave us be.

54:52.334 --> 54:55.963
- Oh, my God.
- Mom, you know, we don't need to do that.

54:55.963 --> 54:59.383
You never told me you were dating
the most beautiful man.

54:59.383 --> 55:01.802
He's got a good personality
to make up for it, though, so--

55:01.802 --> 55:03.595
Okay. Okay. Okay.

55:03.595 --> 55:04.972
Who is he? Where's he work?

55:04.972 --> 55:06.974
- Don't do that. Don't.
- What does he do? Don't do what?

55:06.974 --> 55:08.976
Hey, I am-- I'm your mother.

55:10.102 --> 55:11.144
Boston Grace Hospital.

55:11.728 --> 55:13.146
- Oh, no.
- Stop.

55:13.146 --> 55:14.773
- Welcome to Root.
- No, please, don't.

55:14.773 --> 55:17.442
- Can I get you something to drink?
- God. Please. Thank you. I need alcohol.

55:17.442 --> 55:20.654
I would like to try a negroni.
I hear they're delicious.

55:20.654 --> 55:22.781
- They are. I'll get you a negroni.
- Thank you.

55:22.781 --> 55:24.241
And what can I get you?

55:44.011 --> 55:45.679
I'll-- Surprise me.

55:53.395 --> 55:54.479
So, what'd I miss?

55:54.479 --> 55:56.398
Are you by any chance a doctor?

55:56.398 --> 55:59.943
I am. I'm actually gonna be performing
a once-in-a-lifetime operation soon.

55:59.943 --> 56:02.196
Oh, my Lord. Is it dangerous?

56:02.196 --> 56:03.864
It's a risky surgery.

56:03.864 --> 56:06.950
It's amazing though. He's amazing.

56:06.950 --> 56:08.035
They're five years old.

56:08.035 --> 56:09.203
Thank you so much.

56:17.586 --> 56:18.795
So tell me about Boston.

56:20.088 --> 56:21.757
They were the best years of my life.

56:23.383 --> 56:25.886
- The food is really amazing there...
- Yeah?

56:25.886 --> 56:27.262
...and the harbor.

56:27.262 --> 56:29.640
My uncle would take me
fishing there sometimes.

56:30.390 --> 56:31.600
Sounds like you miss it.

56:32.309 --> 56:33.310
Yeah.

56:33.894 --> 56:35.771
I'm gonna move there after the Marines.

56:36.939 --> 56:38.524
Everything's better in Boston.

56:41.318 --> 56:42.319
Except the girls.

56:44.154 --> 56:45.489
Boston doesn't have you.

56:49.826 --> 56:51.328
I'm gonna miss you.

56:54.873 --> 56:55.874
Same.

56:57.543 --> 56:59.044
I don't know how you did it.

57:01.338 --> 57:03.423
But somehow,
you became my favorite person.

57:08.595 --> 57:09.596
Same.

57:29.366 --> 57:30.367
Hey.

57:30.367 --> 57:31.451
What?

57:31.451 --> 57:33.078
Are you sure?

57:33.078 --> 57:35.247
Yeah. Yeah.

57:49.428 --> 57:50.929
I don't have a condom.

57:51.513 --> 57:53.390
- I have one.
- You do?

57:54.558 --> 57:55.934
It's health class.

58:00.689 --> 58:02.316
I've... I've never done this before.

58:03.233 --> 58:05.694
- It's okay. I'm no expert.
- Okay.

58:05.694 --> 58:07.905
- I've only done it once.
- Okay.

58:07.905 --> 58:09.489
- Okay.
- Okay.

58:16.163 --> 58:18.999
I've been studying them since they
were born, since I've been a resident--

58:18.999 --> 58:21.251
I'm gonna use the bathroom real quick.

58:21.251 --> 58:22.961
- Okay, honey. Okay.
- Yeah.

58:22.961 --> 58:25.589
You get to know each other.
I'll be right back.

58:49.154 --> 58:50.155
Lily Bloom.

58:52.533 --> 58:53.534
Atlas.

58:57.162 --> 58:58.539
You look--

58:58.539 --> 59:00.624
Yeah, you-- You... You...

59:00.624 --> 59:01.917
God, thank you.

59:01.917 --> 59:04.419
I mean, my mom didn't recognize you, so--

59:05.128 --> 59:08.549
- It's probably for the best.
- God, right? Yeah.

59:11.134 --> 59:12.386
What have you been up to?

59:13.136 --> 59:14.304
Just working. Living.

59:14.304 --> 59:15.389
Yeah, same.

59:15.389 --> 59:18.809
Yeah. Did you go to the military or what--

59:18.809 --> 59:21.728
Yeah, yeah. No, I did... I did eight--
Yeah, eight years.

59:21.728 --> 59:23.897
- Wow.
- Yeah. I got out and moved to Boston.

59:24.982 --> 59:25.983
What are--

59:27.192 --> 59:29.361
What are...
What are you doing in... in Boston?

59:29.570 --> 59:31.572
Are you... You visiting here, or--

59:31.572 --> 59:32.781
I live here.

59:36.159 --> 59:38.579
Yeah. Where everything's better.

59:41.999 --> 59:44.501
Is that your-- your guy?

59:44.501 --> 59:48.881
Yeah, that's... That's Ryle.
He's, yeah, he's... he's really special.

59:48.881 --> 59:50.424
I think you'd really like him.

59:50.424 --> 59:52.634
- I'm so happy for you.
- Yeah, thank you.

59:52.634 --> 59:54.803
Do you have anyone, or are you married?

59:54.803 --> 59:57.806
Or do you have a girlfriend
or, you know, anything?

59:57.806 --> 59:59.266
- Yeah. I got Cassie.
- Yeah?

59:59.266 --> 01:00:00.350
Yeah, she's great.

01:00:02.352 --> 01:00:03.604
That's so good.

01:00:05.981 --> 01:00:07.065
You look so well.

01:00:07.065 --> 01:00:09.067
I... I don't wanna get you in trouble
or anything.

01:00:09.067 --> 01:00:10.527
Well, how do I find you?

01:00:11.737 --> 01:00:12.738
If I wanted to find you.

01:00:12.738 --> 01:00:15.324
I... I mean, I... I opened my flower shop.

01:00:15.991 --> 01:00:17.242
Lily Bloom's.

01:00:18.368 --> 01:00:21.205
- Of course you did.
- Yeah. Over in... in Back Bay.

01:00:21.205 --> 01:00:24.791
So, you know,
you can look me up sometime, or...

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:31.673
- Yeah. Well, I... I gotta-- Well, you know.
- Yeah.

01:00:31.673 --> 01:00:33.800
- I'm working, so...
- Okay. Get out of here.

01:00:34.551 --> 01:00:36.303
- Yeah, I'm gonna go. All right.
- Okay.

01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:11.713
- ...once-in-a-lifetime operation.
- Lily?

01:01:11.713 --> 01:01:12.923
What are you drinking?

01:01:12.923 --> 01:01:14.299
I'll have wine, please.

01:01:14.299 --> 01:01:16.093
You are not getting wine.
You're in a onesie.

01:01:16.093 --> 01:01:17.928
- You don't get free wine with a onesie.
- Fair point.

01:01:17.928 --> 01:01:19.847
- Whatever you're having, I'll have it.
- Bingo!

01:01:19.847 --> 01:01:21.890
Three beers and a water for my ladylove.

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.433
Wait, did you just say "water"?

01:01:26.436 --> 01:01:27.437
I'm sorry.

01:01:27.604 --> 01:01:28.730
Okay, yeah.

01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:30.440
We didn't plan on telling you here--

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:31.733
Stop it.

01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:33.902
You know.

01:01:33.902 --> 01:01:35.863
I'm gonna be a dad!

01:01:38.448 --> 01:01:39.825
- And I'm gonna be the mom.
- Yes!

01:01:40.617 --> 01:01:42.327
I'm gonna be a dad!

01:01:42.327 --> 01:01:44.913
- I knew it.
- No, no.

01:01:44.913 --> 01:01:46.915
This is fucking crazy! I know!

01:01:46.915 --> 01:01:49.126
- I'm so happy for you. I'm so happy.
- Yeah.

01:01:50.794 --> 01:01:52.963
- I'm a papa.
- I'm just so happy for you.

01:01:52.963 --> 01:01:54.339
You're gonna be the best mama.

01:01:54.339 --> 01:01:55.465
Oh, my God.

01:01:55.465 --> 01:01:57.593
To Allysa,
who's 11 months younger than me,

01:01:57.593 --> 01:02:00.304
and you still teach me every day
what being a grown-up looks like.

01:02:00.304 --> 01:02:01.388
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:02:01.388 --> 01:02:02.472
Cheers.

01:02:02.472 --> 01:02:04.975
Eleven months? You guys,
I didn't know you were so close in age.

01:02:04.975 --> 01:02:07.352
Oh, yeah. Three kids in three years.

01:02:07.352 --> 01:02:08.896
Makes you feel bad for our mom.

01:02:08.896 --> 01:02:10.647
Three? You guys have a sibling?

01:02:13.734 --> 01:02:17.696
Yeah. Yeah, we had an older brother, Emerson.

01:02:19.865 --> 01:02:21.491
And he died when we were younger.

01:02:26.121 --> 01:02:27.789
I'm so sorry.

01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:30.667
- Let's go. Goal!
- Yeah!

01:02:51.271 --> 01:02:52.272
Good morning.

01:02:53.649 --> 01:02:54.650
You like frittata?

01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:55.776
What is happening?

01:02:56.318 --> 01:02:59.530
No, no, I feel like I'm in a porno.
What... What is this?

01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:02.324
I did not know you could cook.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:04.201
I can't.

01:03:04.201 --> 01:03:07.204
Well, good, 'cause I was
starting to get a little intimidated.

01:03:07.204 --> 01:03:08.914
It was, you know,
a little too good to be true.

01:03:08.914 --> 01:03:10.958
- That's for you. Yeah.
- That's mine. Thank you.

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:14.503
I like a little hair of the dog.
Don't be shy.

01:03:15.337 --> 01:03:16.547
It's actually--

01:03:16.547 --> 01:03:19.550
This is just to celebrate my big surgery tomorrow.

01:03:22.761 --> 01:03:23.762
Oh, my God, I'm--

01:03:24.555 --> 01:03:25.639
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no, no.

01:03:25.639 --> 01:03:28.141
- I don't know what I was thinking. I--
- It's fine.

01:03:28.976 --> 01:03:30.310
It's not fine. I'm sorry.

01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:33.063
- Hey. I am sorry.
- Hey, what's that mean? The heart.

01:03:33.897 --> 01:03:36.608
Oh, God, it's nothing. I just--

01:03:36.608 --> 01:03:38.569
You know, one of those
silly things you do.

01:03:38.569 --> 01:03:41.613
No, it's not nothing.
Every tattoo means something.

01:03:42.114 --> 01:03:43.115
I know. No, no.

01:03:43.115 --> 01:03:45.701
This is just like one of those
silly things you do in high school,

01:03:45.701 --> 01:03:47.870
and I don't know why I still have it.

01:03:50.497 --> 01:03:51.498
No.

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:54.543
It's one of my favorite parts of you.

01:03:57.963 --> 01:04:00.674
Okay. Baby?

01:04:01.258 --> 01:04:02.843
I have to tell you something.

01:04:03.302 --> 01:04:04.636
Your frittata's burning.

01:04:07.598 --> 01:04:08.724
It's gonna be perfect.

01:04:08.724 --> 01:04:09.808
Okay.

01:04:10.809 --> 01:04:13.604
Well, what are some of your
other favorite parts about me?

01:04:22.529 --> 01:04:23.572
Your glabella.

01:04:30.454 --> 01:04:33.665
- Your flagina.
- Oh, no! Stop!

01:04:37.461 --> 01:04:40.297
- Oh, shit!
- I told you. I'm sorry. I did tell you.

01:04:41.340 --> 01:04:43.759
- No, no. Baby, you need a potholder.
- Oh, my God! Shit!

01:04:43.759 --> 01:04:45.469
You're gonna stick your hand in there?

01:04:56.188 --> 01:04:57.272
Hey, baby.

01:05:00.776 --> 01:05:02.945
- Hey, hey. You're okay.
- What was that?

01:05:02.945 --> 01:05:04.863
What was that? No, no.

01:05:04.863 --> 01:05:06.573
- Can you give me a second, please?
- Hey. Hey.

01:05:06.573 --> 01:05:08.450
- Just give me a second.
- Oh, shit!

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:10.452
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

01:05:10.452 --> 01:05:13.038
- Oh, my God. Your hand.
- No, don't worry about my hand.

01:05:13.705 --> 01:05:15.207
Baby, your surgery.

01:05:17.417 --> 01:05:18.752
You okay?

01:05:19.002 --> 01:05:20.754
I think so. I don't know.

01:05:21.547 --> 01:05:22.714
Let me see it.

01:05:24.091 --> 01:05:26.134
- Shit, I'm--
- I know. I'm hurt.

01:05:26.134 --> 01:05:27.719
I knew we'd make a mess.

01:05:28.637 --> 01:05:30.389
- I'm so sorry.
- It was an accident.

01:05:30.389 --> 01:05:32.182
No. I didn't... I didn't... I didn't...

01:05:33.267 --> 01:05:35.060
- What did we do?
- It was an accident.

01:05:38.272 --> 01:05:39.439
I'm okay.

01:05:42.442 --> 01:05:44.027
- God, I'm so sorry.
- Hey.

01:05:44.027 --> 01:05:46.196
- Thank you for coming. Sorry I'm late.
- Stop.

01:05:46.196 --> 01:05:48.365
- I'm a disaster.
- No, here. I think I got everything.

01:05:48.365 --> 01:05:50.367
Yeah, no, no, thank you. Okay.

01:05:50.367 --> 01:05:51.618
How was the wedding?

01:05:51.618 --> 01:05:53.787
- Also a disaster.
- No.

01:05:53.787 --> 01:05:56.582
- It's fine. It's fine. It was a little, just--
- How's a wedding a disaster?

01:05:56.582 --> 01:05:59.710
Well, I mean, their marriage is
probably the disaster, but they're fine.

01:05:59.710 --> 01:06:02.838
- They're lovely. They deserve each other.
- But the flowers were beautiful?

01:06:02.838 --> 01:06:04.464
Yes, the flowers were off the char--

01:06:04.464 --> 01:06:07.301
I'm so sorry. How was your--

01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:10.053
How was your surgery?
How did your sweet hand hold up?

01:06:10.512 --> 01:06:12.097
- It was awesome.
- Really?

01:06:12.097 --> 01:06:13.432
- Yeah.
- Really?

01:06:13.432 --> 01:06:15.934
Yeah. There was this moment--

01:06:17.311 --> 01:06:19.521
Allysa and Marshall messed up.

01:06:19.521 --> 01:06:20.939
We're going to Root.

01:06:20.939 --> 01:06:23.025
The place we went to with your mom.

01:06:23.525 --> 01:06:26.653
- There was this moment, and I--
- Well, hold-- Why? Why?

01:06:26.653 --> 01:06:27.738
I don't know.

01:06:27.738 --> 01:06:29.781
I know, but I was dying
to try the new place...

01:06:29.781 --> 01:06:31.617
- Yeah, but they heard...
- ...and we've already been there.

01:06:31.617 --> 01:06:34.077
- ...how we talked about it and--
- Yeah, but we could just call them.

01:06:34.077 --> 01:06:35.495
- No. They're already there.
- No, I know.

01:06:35.495 --> 01:06:37.039
- They ordered 14 appetizers.
- I really wanted to...

01:06:37.039 --> 01:06:39.082
- You know my sister.
- ...try the new place. I know. I'm sorry.

01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:41.835
- I will take you there next week.
- You know I love food. That's all.

01:06:41.835 --> 01:06:43.420
- You know I'm a creature of habit.
- That's all it is.

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:44.922
- I'll get the same thing I got last time.
- Okay.

01:06:44.922 --> 01:06:47.382
Yeah, I mean, it's perfect.
The food... The food is so good, so--

01:06:50.135 --> 01:06:51.470
Hey. Hey.

01:06:52.137 --> 01:06:53.180
What?

01:06:53.514 --> 01:06:54.515
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:55.432 --> 01:06:57.684
I'm sorry. It's been a...
It's been a week.

01:06:58.602 --> 01:07:01.396
I don't need to be complaining to you.
You've been through it.

01:07:01.897 --> 01:07:02.898
Yeah.

01:07:03.899 --> 01:07:05.234
Tell me. I wanna hear everything.

01:07:05.234 --> 01:07:06.652
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:07:18.038 --> 01:07:20.499
- Hi. Sorry.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:07:20.499 --> 01:07:21.625
- Hey.
- Hi!

01:07:21.625 --> 01:07:22.918
- What's up?
- I'm so sorry we're late.

01:07:22.918 --> 01:07:24.378
Just sit down. Don't worry about it.

01:07:24.378 --> 01:07:25.671
- Can I have this?
- Yeah. Of course.

01:07:25.671 --> 01:07:28.423
- We've ordered so much food.
- We're so sorry.

01:07:28.423 --> 01:07:29.800
- Yeah, it's... it's my fault.
- Oh, baby.

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.134
I didn't--

01:07:31.134 --> 01:07:32.803
Ryle told me something happened,

01:07:32.803 --> 01:07:35.055
but he didn't tell me
it was looking like this.

01:07:35.055 --> 01:07:36.431
Look at you, honey.

01:07:36.431 --> 01:07:37.599
- It's fine. It doesn't even...
- Yeah.

01:07:37.599 --> 01:07:38.684
It doesn't even hurt.

01:07:38.684 --> 01:07:40.185
No, it was a mess. You should have seen her.

01:07:40.185 --> 01:07:41.979
Yeah. I mean, his hand.
And he got hurt too.

01:07:41.979 --> 01:07:44.481
- So we're-- Yeah. We are.
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

01:07:44.481 --> 01:07:48.819
- I feel bad. It was... It was a beautiful mess.
- Yeah.

01:07:49.820 --> 01:07:51.655
Wait, so, dude,
what happened with the surgery?

01:07:52.573 --> 01:07:54.616
Probably the greatest day of my life.

01:07:54.616 --> 01:07:56.827
Twenty-seven hours.

01:07:56.827 --> 01:07:58.495
- Twenty-seven hours?
- Yeah.

01:07:58.495 --> 01:08:01.206
The only thing I've done for 27 hours
is day-trade and play Call of Duty.

01:08:01.206 --> 01:08:02.541
Do you guys have baby names?

01:08:02.541 --> 01:08:05.085
- Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
- And go on a DraftKings bender.

01:08:05.961 --> 01:08:08.589
- Baby names?
- Yeah, sorry. I was, yeah, thinking.

01:08:08.589 --> 01:08:10.674
We're thinking something strong.

01:08:11.258 --> 01:08:13.302
- We're gonna do big-time authors.
- This riff...

01:08:13.302 --> 01:08:14.386
R. L. Stine.

01:08:15.345 --> 01:08:16.345
Judy Blume.

01:08:16.345 --> 01:08:18.055
That is going to be
the demise of our marriage.

01:08:18.055 --> 01:08:19.265
- How we doing, folks?
- Hi.

01:08:19.265 --> 01:08:21.475
- How are you liking your appetizers?
- Wonderful.

01:08:21.475 --> 01:08:24.145
I've had one bite of one thing and this is
already my favorite restaurant.

01:08:24.145 --> 01:08:26.523
- What'd you go for?
- The Brussels sprouts.

01:08:26.523 --> 01:08:27.983
Brussels sprouts.

01:08:27.983 --> 01:08:29.734
What about you? What do you like?

01:08:30.319 --> 01:08:32.613
I'm-- Impossible to choose.

01:08:32.613 --> 01:08:34.363
My regards to the chef.

01:08:34.363 --> 01:08:36.950
Thank you. Appreciate it.
It's actually my mother's recipe.

01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:38.702
That's very beautiful.

01:08:38.702 --> 01:08:41.287
- It's my first restaurant. Yeah.
- Love that.

01:08:41.287 --> 01:08:43.165
And I love the creativity,
dude, seriously.

01:08:43.165 --> 01:08:45.042
- So...
- I'm an entrepreneur as well, so I get it.

01:08:45.042 --> 01:08:46.792
What's... What's your...
What's your deal? What's your thing?

01:08:46.792 --> 01:08:50.464
Right now we're looking to allocate
capital in local Boston businesses,

01:08:50.464 --> 01:08:52.381
and a place like this
would just be amazing.

01:08:52.966 --> 01:08:55.594
Not to be too forward,
but what are margins right now?

01:08:55.594 --> 01:08:58.721
I mean, the place is jumping.
Thirteen, 14, 15 percent?

01:08:58.721 --> 01:09:00.682
But I love the story about your mom.

01:09:01.517 --> 01:09:03.685
You do a Series A and scale this thing up.

01:09:05.854 --> 01:09:07.104
- Honey.
- Did I offend him?

01:09:08.357 --> 01:09:11.443
No, just keep saying "allocating capital."

01:09:11.443 --> 01:09:13.319
- The chef was the asshole.
- I have been holding it for so long.

01:09:13.319 --> 01:09:15.197
I'm gonna go pee really quick.
I'll be right back.

01:09:15.197 --> 01:09:17.282
- Do you want me to come?
- No, I'm good. I'm good.

01:09:17.282 --> 01:09:18.825
- Are you--
- No, no, you... You guys keep talking.

01:09:18.825 --> 01:09:19.952
I'll be right back.

01:09:31.587 --> 01:09:33.799
- Come on.
- What happened?

01:09:36.635 --> 01:09:37.928
Come on, tell me. What happened?

01:09:37.928 --> 01:09:40.930
Nothing. I-- We... I...
He burned his hand, and I fell.

01:09:41.849 --> 01:09:44.643
I know. I know.
It's... It was an accident, though. It was--

01:09:44.643 --> 01:09:46.310
- That was an accident?
- Yes.

01:09:51.316 --> 01:09:52.317
Leave him.

01:09:53.986 --> 01:09:55.487
- God.
- You gotta leave him.

01:09:55.487 --> 01:09:58.282
- I am not your mother, Atlas.
- Leave him. Come on.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:01.493
Are you turning into yours?

01:10:06.039 --> 01:10:07.374
- Let me out of here.
- Lily.

01:10:09.751 --> 01:10:11.253
- Let me out now.
- Lily.

01:10:11.253 --> 01:10:12.337
Stop.

01:10:17.301 --> 01:10:18.302
Wait, what is this?

01:10:19.553 --> 01:10:20.554
Atlas! Stop.

01:10:20.554 --> 01:10:23.182
Touch her again, I'll cut your hand off
and shove it down your throat,

01:10:23.182 --> 01:10:25.851
- you piece of shit.
- Atlas, stop! Stop.

01:10:26.852 --> 01:10:27.853
Stop.

01:10:29.146 --> 01:10:30.480
So this is Atlas.

01:10:30.981 --> 01:10:32.316
- Baby, hey.
- The homeless boy...

01:10:32.316 --> 01:10:34.484
- Come on. Stop.
- ...you wasted your virginity on?

01:10:37.404 --> 01:10:39.656
Guys, stop it! Stop it!

01:10:40.741 --> 01:10:43.493
- Please! Please stop it. Stop!
- Hey! Break it up.

01:10:43.493 --> 01:10:45.204
- No! Please.
- Come on.

01:10:45.204 --> 01:10:47.748
- Please, stop. No!
- Get out of my restaurant!

01:10:47.748 --> 01:10:51.168
- Stop! Let's get out of here.
- Get out of my restaurant!

01:10:51.168 --> 01:10:53.337
- Stop, please, please. Let's go.
- Come on.

01:10:53.337 --> 01:10:55.589
- Get out!
- Stop it, now!

01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:00.636
Ryle?

01:11:00.636 --> 01:11:01.970
Excuse me. Ryle.

01:11:04.306 --> 01:11:06.350
Ryle. Ryle, wait.

01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:08.852
- Ryle, please, wait.
- What was he doing in the bathroom, Lily?

01:11:08.852 --> 01:11:10.103
What was he doing in the bathroom?

01:11:10.103 --> 01:11:11.939
He saw my eye,
and I think he saw your hand.

01:11:11.939 --> 01:11:14.608
And he knows it was an accident.
And I told him it was an accident. He...

01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:17.611
Lily.

01:11:19.655 --> 01:11:20.656
What?

01:11:24.493 --> 01:11:25.494
I don't--

01:11:25.494 --> 01:11:26.787
I don't know him.

01:11:27.371 --> 01:11:28.789
I mean, we... we... We were kids.

01:11:28.789 --> 01:11:30.332
- I don't know him now.
- Anyone but him.

01:11:32.084 --> 01:11:33.252
Anyone but him.

01:11:34.461 --> 01:11:36.797
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I know you. Anyone but him.

01:11:42.261 --> 01:11:43.470
Promise me.

01:11:45.055 --> 01:11:46.139
Okay.

01:11:46.682 --> 01:11:48.016
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:11:49.226 --> 01:11:50.310
Yeah.

01:11:50.602 --> 01:11:51.770
I don't know.

01:11:53.647 --> 01:11:54.648
Okay.

01:11:55.524 --> 01:11:57.150
Okay, okay, okay.

01:11:57.150 --> 01:11:58.902
I've never been here before.

01:12:02.364 --> 01:12:05.826
- You have me. You have all of me.
- I know. I know. I know.

01:12:05.826 --> 01:12:08.495
- So, if I'm not what you want, you just--
- No, no, no. I'm fine.

01:12:08.495 --> 01:12:10.080
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:12:10.914 --> 01:12:12.416
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:14.751
Stop. Stop.

01:12:15.586 --> 01:12:17.254
- Stop.
- I love you, Lily.

01:12:17.254 --> 01:12:19.923
I know. I know. I know. I know.

01:12:20.591 --> 01:12:21.925
I know.

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:24.595
I love you, Lily.

01:12:27.264 --> 01:12:28.432
I love you, too.

01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:39.568
No, please stop. No, please, please.

01:12:39.568 --> 01:12:41.778
Lily! Open the door.

01:12:42.362 --> 01:12:43.739
- You gotta leave right now.
- Lily!

01:12:43.739 --> 01:12:45.199
- I'm coming!
- Open the door!

01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:47.326
- Leave right now. Put your clothes on.
- Who's in there?

01:12:47.326 --> 01:12:49.119
- He's coming. Come on.
- Hey! Open--

01:13:24.613 --> 01:13:26.698
- Thank you. Enjoy.
- Thank you for coming by.

01:13:26.698 --> 01:13:27.783
We appreciate it.

01:13:28.534 --> 01:13:29.743
- Bye.
- Thank you.

01:13:29.743 --> 01:13:31.078
Thanks so much for stopping in.

01:13:31.078 --> 01:13:32.454
- It's busy.
- Yeah.

01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:37.626
I think that's the last of it.

01:13:38.001 --> 01:13:39.002
How you doing, mama?

01:13:39.002 --> 01:13:40.671
I'm doing.

01:13:42.297 --> 01:13:44.258
- I'm doing.
- You in that little dress.

01:13:44.258 --> 01:13:45.342
Do you mind if I--

01:13:46.176 --> 01:13:49.054
- If I see the baby for a moment?
- Oh, yeah. Have a visit.

01:13:49.054 --> 01:13:51.557
Hi, bubba. How you doing? You getting big.

01:13:52.057 --> 01:13:53.058
Hey, question.

01:13:53.851 --> 01:13:56.979
If we're not allowed
to go back to that restaurant...

01:13:56.979 --> 01:13:58.063
Yeah.

01:13:58.063 --> 01:14:01.400
...why is he allowed to
come to this store?

01:14:07.197 --> 01:14:08.532
- I don't--
- Coffee.

01:14:08.532 --> 01:14:11.451
- Okay.
- I'm getting coffee. Would you like some?

01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:13.996
No, I'm good. Thank you.

01:14:13.996 --> 01:14:16.456
- Excuse me. Hi. Hey. Excuse me.
- Hi.

01:14:17.416 --> 01:14:18.458
Thank you.

01:14:18.458 --> 01:14:20.127
- Nice to see you.
- Yeah.

01:14:23.505 --> 01:14:24.506
Hi.

01:14:25.841 --> 01:14:26.842
Hi.

01:14:27.634 --> 01:14:29.636
This is incredible.

01:14:29.928 --> 01:14:31.013
Yeah, thanks.

01:14:31.013 --> 01:14:33.432
Kind of exactly how I imagined it.

01:14:36.059 --> 01:14:37.060
Yeah, yours too.

01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:39.271
Thanks.

01:14:40.772 --> 01:14:41.857
Look at us.

01:14:45.068 --> 01:14:46.320
So, look, I...

01:14:49.031 --> 01:14:51.116
I came by the next day after the fight,

01:14:53.035 --> 01:14:56.580
but he was here. And I... I just didn't think
that was a good idea.

01:14:58.457 --> 01:15:00.501
I just... I just wanted to say I'm really sorry.

01:15:00.501 --> 01:15:03.337
- I was out of my mind...
- Yeah.

01:15:03.337 --> 01:15:05.088
...and... and acted like a jackass and...

01:15:05.088 --> 01:15:07.007
I just feel really bad and I'm sorry.

01:15:07.007 --> 01:15:09.009
Yeah, yeah. No, it's all good. It's...

01:15:09.718 --> 01:15:11.845
Yeah. It was a misunderstanding. So--

01:15:11.845 --> 01:15:14.598
Well, I don't... I don't know. I mean, no, it wasn't.

01:15:15.098 --> 01:15:16.266
I don't think it was.

01:15:21.396 --> 01:15:23.899
Why are you here now?
I gave you my address months ago.

01:15:23.899 --> 01:15:25.275
What are you... What are you doing?

01:15:25.275 --> 01:15:26.610
I came the next day.

01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:36.453
I drive this street a lot.

01:15:44.837 --> 01:15:45.838
Yeah.

01:15:52.135 --> 01:15:53.554
I'm sorry.

01:15:57.599 --> 01:15:58.767
Are you happy?

01:16:01.728 --> 01:16:02.771
Yeah.

01:16:04.648 --> 01:16:06.066
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:16:06.733 --> 01:16:08.151
I couldn't be happier.

01:16:10.445 --> 01:16:11.446
Are you?

01:16:15.033 --> 01:16:16.159
No.

01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:22.374
Sorry.

01:16:35.512 --> 01:16:36.680
That your phone?

01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.764
Yeah.

01:16:40.475 --> 01:16:41.476
What are you doing?

01:16:47.107 --> 01:16:49.776
That's my number. In case you need it.

01:16:53.530 --> 01:16:55.365
Okay, well, I won't, so...

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:57.618
But thank you.

01:16:57.618 --> 01:16:58.785
I hope you don't.

01:17:08.587 --> 01:17:09.838
Hey, that--

01:17:10.672 --> 01:17:12.466
That thing that he said about that--

01:17:12.466 --> 01:17:14.218
You know, with us. It wasn't--

01:17:15.469 --> 01:17:16.470
<i>It wasn't wasted.</i>

01:17:17.638 --> 01:17:19.014
I know.

01:17:21.266 --> 01:17:22.267
I was there.

01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:38.951
Hi.

01:17:44.498 --> 01:17:45.916
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:53.382
That smells good.

01:17:53.382 --> 01:17:54.550
Thank you.

01:17:59.137 --> 01:18:00.514
Are you happy?

01:18:06.019 --> 01:18:07.104
Are you okay?

01:18:08.230 --> 01:18:09.481
Yeah. I'm just--

01:18:10.107 --> 01:18:11.525
I'm just curious.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.447
I wasn't.

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:21.326
Lily, you make me happy.

01:18:22.828 --> 01:18:23.829
Are you happy?

01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:28.250
I mean, I don't think anyone's
happy all the time, but...

01:18:29.459 --> 01:18:31.211
I don't know if I like the sound of that.

01:18:31.211 --> 01:18:32.838
No, no. It's just, you know--

01:18:32.838 --> 01:18:36.300
Of course I deal with, you know, my stuff

01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:41.054
and, you know, life, and ticking clock

01:18:41.054 --> 01:18:43.223
- and, you know, all those decisions that--
- Right.

01:18:43.223 --> 01:18:45.517
that women have to worry about.

01:18:45.517 --> 01:18:48.187
But, I think I'm an innately happy person.

01:18:48.187 --> 01:18:53.150
It's probably just a coping mechanism
I learned from my mom. So...

01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:54.234
Your mom?

01:18:57.571 --> 01:18:59.323
My dad used to hit her.

01:19:09.166 --> 01:19:11.001
Shit, I'm so sorry.

01:19:12.377 --> 01:19:13.712
You never told me that.

01:19:15.297 --> 01:19:17.382
That's not something people talk about.

01:19:18.717 --> 01:19:20.135
Did he ever hurt you?

01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:24.097
No. He nearly killed Atlas though.

01:19:29.811 --> 01:19:31.563
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

01:19:36.151 --> 01:19:37.611
Oh, God.

01:19:39.988 --> 01:19:41.490
I'm so embarrassed. I--

01:19:42.574 --> 01:19:44.326
That mess at the restaurant.

01:19:46.537 --> 01:19:48.622
I didn't know.
That must have been so hard on you.

01:19:48.622 --> 01:19:49.706
Yeah.

01:19:50.916 --> 01:19:53.001
Baby, all I wanna do in my life
is protect you.

01:19:53.001 --> 01:19:54.169
You know that, right?

01:19:54.837 --> 01:19:57.089
When you hurt yourself by accident,

01:19:58.423 --> 01:20:00.133
when you stub your toe, I blame myself.

01:20:00.133 --> 01:20:03.679
It's like it's my fault
that the wall was there.

01:20:03.679 --> 01:20:04.763
Stop.

01:20:04.763 --> 01:20:07.224
I'm the luckiest goddamn man
on this planet.

01:20:09.935 --> 01:20:12.104
And I could clean up. Trust me.

01:20:12.104 --> 01:20:13.939
Okay. I'm not trying to hear about that.

01:20:13.939 --> 01:20:16.859
- You don't wanna hear about that? Just a little bit?
- No. No.

01:20:17.651 --> 01:20:19.903
Yeah, I'm a ripped neurosurgeon
for Christ's sake.

01:20:19.903 --> 01:20:21.780
When was the last time
you saw someone who looked like me

01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:23.574
that wasn't on a daytime soap?

01:20:23.574 --> 01:20:26.451
I mean, come to think of it,
yeah, I-- No, I haven't.

01:20:26.451 --> 01:20:28.120
- Yeah.
- And I'm rich.

01:20:28.579 --> 01:20:29.830
And humble.

01:20:32.165 --> 01:20:33.584
We can work on that.

01:20:34.543 --> 01:20:35.961
God, I love you.

01:20:36.545 --> 01:20:39.548
I know. I love you too.
That's the problem.

01:20:41.508 --> 01:20:42.801
<i>It's a big problem.</i>

01:20:44.011 --> 01:20:45.637
<i>It's a really big problem.</i>

01:21:06.408 --> 01:21:07.409
Stop.

01:21:15.334 --> 01:21:17.753
Look at her. She's like a little alien.

01:21:18.378 --> 01:21:20.923
Yeah, she's perfect.

01:21:25.052 --> 01:21:26.178
Do you want to hold her?

01:21:28.472 --> 01:21:30.599
- Yeah.
- I knew it.

01:21:30.599 --> 01:21:31.892
Here you go.

01:21:31.892 --> 01:21:33.060
Okay.

01:21:34.937 --> 01:21:37.564
- Hi.
- There we go. Right there.

01:21:37.689 --> 01:21:41.276
- You're so beautiful. Hi.
- Wow.

01:21:41.276 --> 01:21:42.528
You're a mama.

01:21:42.528 --> 01:21:43.862
Yeah.

01:21:43.862 --> 01:21:45.739
My sister's a mama.

01:21:45.739 --> 01:21:47.157
And you're an uncle.

01:21:52.996 --> 01:21:55.123
Wow. You did it.

01:21:56.917 --> 01:21:59.253
This is just hormones. Don't look at me.

01:22:00.295 --> 01:22:02.089
Do you guys want kids? Well--

01:22:02.089 --> 01:22:04.716
No pressure. We're not...
Not putting you on the spot right now.

01:22:04.716 --> 01:22:07.636
I mean, it would be great
for childcare and stuff like that.

01:22:09.012 --> 01:22:11.348
I'm not gonna make her
put on a white dress

01:22:11.348 --> 01:22:12.766
and have my babies.

01:22:14.017 --> 01:22:15.644
Unless she wants to.

01:22:17.354 --> 01:22:18.981
Then I would marry her tonight.

01:22:24.611 --> 01:22:26.071
- Oh, shit. He's serious.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:22:26.071 --> 01:22:28.782
Ryle, you are--
You're drunk on baby smell.

01:22:28.782 --> 01:22:30.659
No, no, no. I am serious as an aneurysm.

01:22:30.659 --> 01:22:33.495
Oh, God. Please don't do
neurosurgeon humor when you're propos--

01:22:33.495 --> 01:22:34.580
I mean, if you are.

01:22:34.580 --> 01:22:35.956
Is that-- Is this--

01:22:35.956 --> 01:22:37.791
- He's going around.
- I mean, if that's what you--

01:22:37.791 --> 01:22:39.459
- Give me the baby.
- This is out of it--

01:22:39.459 --> 01:22:40.961
- Please stop.
- Yeah. Wait.

01:22:40.961 --> 01:22:42.754
No, no. No, no, stop.

01:22:42.754 --> 01:22:44.923
- He's doing it?
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:22:44.923 --> 01:22:46.717
Okay. Okay. What--

01:22:48.302 --> 01:22:49.344
Can we just--

01:22:50.053 --> 01:22:51.680
Can you get the baby? We have a baby.

01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:52.973
- We can take that. That's ours.
- Give me.

01:22:52.973 --> 01:22:54.683
- Here you go.
- Here you go, baby.

01:22:54.683 --> 01:22:57.644
You get back down there.
You get back down there right this second.

01:23:04.568 --> 01:23:06.403
Will you marry me, Lily Blossom Bloom?

01:23:09.823 --> 01:23:10.824
Yeah?

01:23:10.824 --> 01:23:11.992
Okay.

01:23:11.992 --> 01:23:14.745
- This is just-- I'm just--
- He did it.

01:23:14.745 --> 01:23:16.330
This is a miracle.

01:23:17.164 --> 01:23:18.165
Oh, thank God.

01:23:18.999 --> 01:23:20.334
Oh, my God.

01:23:29.593 --> 01:23:32.304
- But we'll do a proper wedding one day.
<i>- You got married without me.</i>

01:23:32.304 --> 01:23:34.681
And I continue to be very sorry,

01:23:34.681 --> 01:23:36.558
but at some point
you're gonna have to forgive me.

01:23:36.558 --> 01:23:37.976
I will wear you down.

01:23:37.976 --> 01:23:39.895
- My wife will wear you down.
<i>- Not possible.</i>

01:23:39.895 --> 01:23:42.105
I don't think you should ever forgive her.
Just saying.

01:23:42.105 --> 01:23:44.650
Okay. That's enough of that.
Hold on, can you charge my phone?

01:23:44.650 --> 01:23:47.444
<i>I haven't been dreaming about
your wedding day your whole life,</i>

01:23:47.444 --> 01:23:49.154
<i>I've been dreaming about it my whole life.</i>

01:23:49.154 --> 01:23:51.490
<i>And I'm sorry, I just feel cheated.</i>

01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:54.701
Yeah, okay. Got it. Thanks, Mom.
Okay, we're gonna find a way to move on.

01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:56.703
<i>If I don't get to watch you
walk down the aisle,</i>

01:23:56.703 --> 01:23:59.122
<i>I will not be denied watching you squirm.</i>

01:23:59.122 --> 01:24:01.458
<i>- You wanna make it up to me?</i>
- Yes, please.

01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:04.878
<i>Make me a grandbaby. No, three. Three.
Make it triplets.</i>

01:24:04.878 --> 01:24:08.215
All right, can you just-- Can we move past
this conversation, please?

01:24:10.467 --> 01:24:11.468
You okay?

01:24:12.678 --> 01:24:13.679
<i>What happened?</i>

01:24:14.221 --> 01:24:16.098
- Mom, I'll call you right back, okay?
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:24:16.098 --> 01:24:17.182
Yeah, no, hang up.

01:24:20.227 --> 01:24:21.395
Hey, what happened?

01:24:26.441 --> 01:24:27.609
Hey, you okay?

01:24:34.366 --> 01:24:35.784
I dropped your phone,

01:24:38.161 --> 01:24:39.788
and the case fell off.

01:24:51.049 --> 01:24:52.301
And I found this.

01:24:58.807 --> 01:25:00.225
I called the number...

01:25:11.361 --> 01:25:13.280
- It wasn't--
- You promised me.

01:25:14.031 --> 01:25:15.866
- I know.
- I would never lie to you.

01:25:15.866 --> 01:25:17.159
I know. It's nothing.

01:25:17.159 --> 01:25:19.244
- It's nothing?
- Yeah.

01:25:19.786 --> 01:25:20.913
Yeah.

01:25:21.079 --> 01:25:23.749
- It's nothing?
- Yes. Yes, I promise.

01:25:24.499 --> 01:25:25.792
Yeah.

01:25:28.629 --> 01:25:29.630
Okay?

01:25:38.013 --> 01:25:39.014
It's nothing.

01:25:40.015 --> 01:25:42.267
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:25:50.275 --> 01:25:51.276
Ryle.

01:25:52.027 --> 01:25:54.696
Ryle, baby, I promise
I didn't mean to see him.

01:25:54.696 --> 01:25:56.615
- I promise. Please.
- Stop! No, no, no.

01:25:56.615 --> 01:25:58.283
- No. I promise, please.
- Lily, stop!

01:25:58.283 --> 01:26:00.035
No, it's-- Please, just listen to me.

01:26:00.035 --> 01:26:02.496
- Please. I didn't know he was coming.
- You promised me, Lily. Stop.

01:26:02.496 --> 01:26:04.248
- Just talk to me. Please. Just--
- Stop!

01:26:04.248 --> 01:26:06.375
- You stop. Please. Don't--
- Stop!

01:26:11.088 --> 01:26:14.716
Hey. Just try to be still.

01:26:15.717 --> 01:26:16.718
Just try to be still.

01:26:20.722 --> 01:26:22.224
It's all done. I'm here.

01:26:22.224 --> 01:26:23.475
- Stop.
- I'm here.

01:26:24.226 --> 01:26:25.310
Hey.

01:26:25.310 --> 01:26:27.980
What-- What happened?

01:26:28.981 --> 01:26:30.732
You fell down the stairs.

01:26:32.901 --> 01:26:34.820
No, no, no. Don't... Don't touch it.

01:26:35.696 --> 01:26:37.573
Yeah, you tripped and--

01:26:38.115 --> 01:26:40.784
And I... I... I tried to catch you.

01:26:40.784 --> 01:26:43.412
- No, Ryle, no.
- You're... You're okay. You're okay.

01:26:46.415 --> 01:26:47.499
- Don't.
- It hurts.

01:26:47.499 --> 01:26:49.001
I know it hurts. You're okay.

01:26:49.001 --> 01:26:50.586
- Okay.
- You're okay.

01:26:53.172 --> 01:26:54.506
Do you know who you are?

01:26:55.424 --> 01:26:56.758
Lily Bloom.

01:26:56.758 --> 01:26:58.135
Okay. Where are you?

01:26:59.178 --> 01:27:00.929
- Our apartment.
- Okay. Who am I?

01:27:02.514 --> 01:27:03.849
My husband.

01:27:05.434 --> 01:27:06.894
And what am I doing right now?

01:27:08.187 --> 01:27:09.521
Helping me.

01:27:12.441 --> 01:27:14.193
How many fingers am I holding up?

01:27:16.528 --> 01:27:17.529
- Five.
- Five.

01:27:17.529 --> 01:27:19.615
- And now? Okay.
- Two.

01:27:20.199 --> 01:27:21.617
Tell me it's nothing.

01:27:25.621 --> 01:27:26.914
It's nothing.

01:27:28.832 --> 01:27:29.875
Yeah, come.

01:27:31.668 --> 01:27:32.961
Thank you.

01:27:37.716 --> 01:27:38.717
Am I okay?

01:27:38.717 --> 01:27:40.302
You're okay. You're okay.

01:27:40.928 --> 01:27:42.012
Okay.

01:28:32.938 --> 01:28:34.356
Lily! Oh, my God.

01:28:34.356 --> 01:28:36.692
Did you see it? Did you see the magazine?

01:28:36.692 --> 01:28:38.485
You did it! Look at this!

01:28:38.485 --> 01:28:40.320
Top ten. We're in the top ten!

01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:42.573
- We're in the top-- You did it.
- Wait, where is it?

01:28:42.573 --> 01:28:44.867
Where's the genius? Right there.
Look, look, look.

01:28:44.867 --> 01:28:46.201
- Right there. There's you!
- Oh, my God.

01:28:46.201 --> 01:28:47.870
Oh, my God. I'm gonna call Ryle

01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:50.622
and then tell him
to get, like, 50 copies of this thing.

01:29:21.028 --> 01:29:22.029
Hey.

01:29:22.988 --> 01:29:23.989
Hey.

01:29:31.663 --> 01:29:32.664
You saw?

01:29:34.333 --> 01:29:36.251
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, thank you.

01:29:36.251 --> 01:29:39.755
I didn't know it was a big deal,
"Best in Boston."

01:29:39.755 --> 01:29:41.173
Best in Boston.

01:29:47.679 --> 01:29:48.722
Hello.

01:29:50.974 --> 01:29:52.142
Okay.

01:29:56.563 --> 01:29:57.898
I love this tattoo.

01:29:59.566 --> 01:30:01.235
Hey, remind me what that means again.

01:30:03.362 --> 01:30:04.863
What?

01:30:06.323 --> 01:30:07.658
I told you.

01:30:08.617 --> 01:30:10.118
Really doesn't mean anything?

01:30:14.122 --> 01:30:15.374
Did you read it yet?

01:30:16.708 --> 01:30:18.001
Yeah, did you?

01:30:20.212 --> 01:30:21.255
Will you read it to me?

01:30:21.922 --> 01:30:23.841
- I don't like that kinda stuff.
- Please.

01:30:23.841 --> 01:30:25.884
No. Baby, I made dinner,
and it's gonna get cold.

01:30:25.884 --> 01:30:29.972
- Read it.
- And I don't love this kinda stuff, okay?

01:30:34.184 --> 01:30:35.352
"Number seven, Lily Bloom's.

01:30:35.352 --> 01:30:38.814
- An avant-garde floral shop--" What?
- No, no. Skip to number one.

01:30:38.814 --> 01:30:41.650
Our favorite restaurant.

01:30:49.199 --> 01:30:50.450
Look, baby, I--

01:30:51.451 --> 01:30:52.452
Read it.

01:30:59.543 --> 01:31:01.461
"The top pick should
come as no surprise--"

01:31:01.461 --> 01:31:03.130
No, go to the end.

"The owner, Atlas Corrigan,

01:31:07.259 --> 01:31:10.846
spoke to the sweet origin story behind
his farm-to-table hot spot, Root.

When I was a kid, I carved a..."

01:31:17.728 --> 01:31:19.313
- Carved what?
- Baby, I don't wanna read--

01:31:19.313 --> 01:31:20.397
Keep reading.

01:31:25.235 --> 01:31:27.529
"...small hollow heart
from an oak tree for a girl.

01:31:27.529 --> 01:31:29.948
So the name was meant to represent
something she said to me,

01:31:29.948 --> 01:31:31.825
which I'm gonna keep between us.

01:31:31.825 --> 01:31:34.494
But there was no other name for Root.
It was...

01:31:35.871 --> 01:31:36.872
always for her."

01:31:36.872 --> 01:31:37.956
Baby--

01:31:39.082 --> 01:31:40.918
Just go to this last paragraph.

01:31:41.502 --> 01:31:42.669
It gets better.

01:31:45.881 --> 01:31:47.299
- I don't wanna--
- Read it.

01:31:52.971 --> 01:31:55.557
"When asked if he had seen the girl
since they were kids,

01:31:55.557 --> 01:31:57.518

'Yes. Next question.'"

01:32:11.532 --> 01:32:12.533
Do you love him?

01:32:13.867 --> 01:32:14.868
I did.

01:32:14.868 --> 01:32:15.953
Do you love him now?

01:32:16.662 --> 01:32:17.663
I love you.

01:32:17.663 --> 01:32:19.164
That wasn't my question.

01:32:32.511 --> 01:32:33.512
I don't know.

01:32:54.533 --> 01:32:55.534
Thank you.

01:33:07.838 --> 01:33:09.131
Okay, baby.

01:33:10.132 --> 01:33:11.717
- Come on. Let's have dinner.
- No.

01:33:11.717 --> 01:33:13.218
Okay. Please.

01:33:14.219 --> 01:33:16.638
Hey, no, no, no. Not now. Please. Just--

01:33:16.638 --> 01:33:19.349
Please. Hey. Stop, please.

01:33:19.892 --> 01:33:21.226
Baby, stop. Stop.

01:33:21.226 --> 01:33:24.605
- You want me to stop?
- Not now. Hey, stop it.

01:33:25.272 --> 01:33:26.273
Stop it.

01:33:26.273 --> 01:33:27.691
- Hey.
- Stop!

01:33:27.691 --> 01:33:29.651
- Hey.
- Stop, please. Please, stop.

01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:30.777
Hey!

01:33:30.777 --> 01:33:31.904
- Hey.
- Stop.

01:33:33.947 --> 01:33:35.199
Stop it.

01:33:35.199 --> 01:33:38.285
Stop! Stop. Hey!

01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:40.329
Don't. Stop. Stop. Hey.

01:33:40.329 --> 01:33:42.831
- What are you doing? Stop. Stop.
- Hey.

01:33:42.831 --> 01:33:44.875
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:33:44.875 --> 01:33:47.169
- Baby. Hey.
- Stop. Stop.

01:33:49.046 --> 01:33:50.047
Hey.

01:33:51.381 --> 01:33:52.508
I love you.

01:33:54.927 --> 01:33:57.054
I just haven't shown you
how much I love you.

01:33:57.054 --> 01:33:58.263
You have.

01:33:58.972 --> 01:34:00.307
- You have.
- No.

01:34:00.933 --> 01:34:02.100
You have.

01:34:02.684 --> 01:34:04.144
- Baby...
- Please.

01:34:04.144 --> 01:34:06.104
You have, baby. You have.

01:34:06.313 --> 01:34:07.439
Okay.

01:34:12.945 --> 01:34:15.239
Okay. Okay.

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:20.327
- I love you so much.
- I love you, baby.

01:34:20.911 --> 01:34:22.246
- I love you.
- I love you so much.

01:34:22.913 --> 01:34:25.791
Baby. Baby, please stop.

01:34:25.916 --> 01:34:27.292
Please stop.

01:34:27.292 --> 01:34:30.462
Please. Hey. Hey, stop. Stop.

01:34:30.462 --> 01:34:32.047
Hey. Stop. Look at me.

01:34:32.047 --> 01:34:34.716
- I love you so much.
- Look at me. No, no. Look at me.

01:34:34.716 --> 01:34:37.094
And I want you to know
that I love you enough.

01:34:37.094 --> 01:34:38.762
- You have. Hey. Hey.
- No.

01:34:38.762 --> 01:34:40.764
Look at me. Look at me. I love you.

01:34:40.764 --> 01:34:42.474
Baby, look at me. Please look at me.

01:34:42.474 --> 01:34:44.309
- Please look at me.
- That tattoo.

01:34:44.309 --> 01:34:47.145
Please look at me.
Please look at me. Please.

01:34:47.145 --> 01:34:49.147
Please. Please. I love you.

01:34:49.147 --> 01:34:50.983
I love you. I love you. Please.

01:34:50.983 --> 01:34:52.818
<i>Please, don't do this.</i>

01:34:52.818 --> 01:34:54.528
<i>Please. Please. Please.</i>

01:34:54.653 --> 01:34:56.238
Stop! Stop!

01:35:20.387 --> 01:35:22.097
I don't think I've shown you
how much I love you.

01:35:23.098 --> 01:35:25.142
<i>- Yes, you have.
- No.</i>

01:35:25.142 --> 01:35:26.351
<i>No, I haven't.</i>

01:35:43.827 --> 01:35:45.495
- Hands.
- Yes, chef.

01:36:29.414 --> 01:36:31.333
I was never gonna become her.

01:36:33.877 --> 01:36:35.379
You're not becoming her.

01:36:36.380 --> 01:36:37.840
Don't even think about that.

01:36:39.258 --> 01:36:40.259
Okay?

01:36:42.135 --> 01:36:43.470
- Yeah.
- You're not.

01:36:54.982 --> 01:36:56.316
Is that what I think it is?

01:36:59.987 --> 01:37:01.071
Yeah.

01:37:06.535 --> 01:37:09.162
I wanna tell you something.
I don't know if it's the right time--

01:37:09.288 --> 01:37:10.581
Sorry for the delay.

01:37:11.707 --> 01:37:13.333
Been really busy tonight.

01:37:14.710 --> 01:37:17.546
So, we have a certain examination
for these situations.

01:37:17.713 --> 01:37:21.550
It's called the SANE exam.
It's completely optional, of course--

01:37:22.885 --> 01:37:24.219
He didn't--

01:37:25.721 --> 01:37:26.847
No, I wasn't-- It's--

01:37:26.847 --> 01:37:27.931
Did he try?

01:37:29.308 --> 01:37:31.727
I don't need the exam. Thank you. Yeah.

01:37:33.437 --> 01:37:34.438
May I?

01:37:34.438 --> 01:37:36.356
Oh, yeah. Of course.

01:37:41.069 --> 01:37:42.070
Does this hurt?

01:37:43.697 --> 01:37:44.781
This?

01:37:44.781 --> 01:37:46.992
No, it's just the skin. Yeah.

01:37:47.242 --> 01:37:48.577
So, usually,

01:37:49.453 --> 01:37:52.956
I'd give you an X-ray on this collarbone
to make sure that it isn't fractured,

01:37:52.956 --> 01:37:56.293
but, given your situation,
we're gonna clean it up,

01:37:56.293 --> 01:37:59.213
and the nurse is gonna come in
and give you a tetanus shot.

01:38:00.130 --> 01:38:02.132
I-- I don't understand.

01:38:02.132 --> 01:38:05.219
We don't give X-rays to pregnant women
unless it's vital.

01:38:05.844 --> 01:38:06.845
Okay?

01:38:10.307 --> 01:38:11.308
Yeah.

01:38:11.308 --> 01:38:12.392
- Right. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:38:12.392 --> 01:38:13.477
Okay.

01:38:34.998 --> 01:38:37.042
There's no Cassie, is there?

01:38:37.751 --> 01:38:38.752
No.

01:38:41.255 --> 01:38:42.339
No, there isn't.

01:38:45.968 --> 01:38:47.135
It's--

01:38:48.053 --> 01:38:49.137
It's the place.

01:38:56.144 --> 01:38:57.646
Kitchen, living room.

01:38:59.273 --> 01:39:00.899
Hey, let me grab you some clothes.

01:39:11.243 --> 01:39:12.244
Thank you.

01:39:12.244 --> 01:39:13.996
My dad won't even notice they're gone.

01:39:18.083 --> 01:39:19.334
Bedroom's all yours.

01:39:19.334 --> 01:39:21.378
- No, I'm not gonna take your bedroom.
- No. Please.

01:39:21.378 --> 01:39:23.380
I have to get up early
for work anyway, so...

01:39:24.089 --> 01:39:26.383
I love that couch. It's a good couch.

01:39:27.384 --> 01:39:29.469
So, stay as long as you want.

01:39:30.179 --> 01:39:31.305
Thank you.

01:39:31.597 --> 01:39:32.973
Okay. Now, get some rest.

01:39:35.309 --> 01:39:36.351
See you tomorrow.

01:40:43.001 --> 01:40:44.044
Hey.

01:40:44.711 --> 01:40:45.712
Hi.

01:40:52.344 --> 01:40:56.807
I wasn't sure if you were hungry,
so I went with a few fan favorites.

01:41:03.355 --> 01:41:05.190
What song do you want at your funeral?

01:41:08.610 --> 01:41:09.778
If you had to pick one.

01:41:10.696 --> 01:41:11.947
Have you not thought about this?

01:41:11.947 --> 01:41:13.615
What song you're gonna play at my funeral?

01:41:13.615 --> 01:41:14.700
Yeah.

01:41:14.700 --> 01:41:19.496
At my funeral,
I'm thinking Creed, "With Arms Wide Open".

01:41:19.496 --> 01:41:21.290
- You know, <i>"With arms wide..."</i>
- Yeah.

01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:23.000
...as the casket's being lowered.

01:41:33.844 --> 01:41:35.137
You're gonna be okay.

01:41:38.974 --> 01:41:40.475
It doesn't feel like it.

01:41:41.476 --> 01:41:42.477
I know.

01:41:43.645 --> 01:41:44.730
But you are.

01:41:46.148 --> 01:41:48.817
I think it's a little different this time.

01:41:52.654 --> 01:41:54.448
If I can't even take care of myself,

01:41:54.448 --> 01:41:59.536
then how am I, you know,
supposed to take care of a baby?

01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:16.803
That night I went
to that old abandoned house,

01:42:16.803 --> 01:42:19.389
I didn't go there because
I needed a place to stay,

01:42:19.890 --> 01:42:21.475
I went there to kill myself.

01:42:24.394 --> 01:42:26.480
And I was sitting
on the living room floor,

01:42:26.480 --> 01:42:28.815
and I saw you in your bedroom window.

01:42:28.815 --> 01:42:29.983
The light came on,

01:42:30.734 --> 01:42:32.694
and you poked your head
through that curtain,

01:42:32.694 --> 01:42:36.240
and as soon as I saw your face,
I couldn't do it.

01:42:37.866 --> 01:42:40.285
The next day, you brought me food,
you fed me...

01:42:47.501 --> 01:42:48.585
I mean, you saved--

01:42:50.420 --> 01:42:53.465
You saved my life
is what I'm trying to say.

01:42:55.259 --> 01:42:56.343
That's who you are.

01:42:57.219 --> 01:43:03.225
And if you decide to keep it,
you are going to be an amazing mother.

01:43:05.435 --> 01:43:07.896
And that baby is so lucky.

01:43:13.485 --> 01:43:14.528
You've got this.

01:43:41.847 --> 01:43:42.931
Lily.

01:44:18.258 --> 01:44:20.385
If you ever find yourself in the position
to love somebody again,

01:44:20.385 --> 01:44:21.887
just fall in love with me.

01:44:29.102 --> 01:44:30.938
Yeah. Okay.

01:45:07.307 --> 01:45:08.809
I'm so sorry.

01:45:11.562 --> 01:45:16.650
I've been watching him my entire life,
and I've seen...

01:45:18.902 --> 01:45:24.658
how afraid he is
of opening his heart to anyone,

01:45:26.743 --> 01:45:28.412
ever since he was a kid.

01:45:30.372 --> 01:45:34.710
And I think I felt
that he was dying inside.

01:45:36.753 --> 01:45:39.339
Just dying inside, little by little,

01:45:41.216 --> 01:45:42.718
until he met you.

01:45:45.470 --> 01:45:48.223
And I'm not making any excuses...

01:45:50.058 --> 01:45:51.059
I never--

01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:54.646
I never thought he was capable of this.

01:46:01.737 --> 01:46:05.782
Would it... Would it be okay
if I asked what happened to Emerson?

01:46:07.075 --> 01:46:08.243
Of course.

01:46:11.663 --> 01:46:14.082
You deserve to know, and it's our family.

01:46:21.548 --> 01:46:23.217
My father had a gun.

01:46:24.718 --> 01:46:28.222
Ryle and Emerson were
playing in the house,

01:46:28.805 --> 01:46:31.391
you know, pretending to be cowboys,

01:46:32.559 --> 01:46:33.602
and they found it.

01:46:35.229 --> 01:46:37.231
And Ryle was six years old.

01:46:37.898 --> 01:46:39.942
He was a six-year-old boy.

01:46:42.986 --> 01:46:44.821
He didn't even know
that it was a real gun.

01:46:44.821 --> 01:46:46.490
He thought that it was pretend

01:46:48.492 --> 01:46:51.662
until it was too late.

01:46:55.249 --> 01:46:57.084
- Emerson was our brother...
- I'm so sorry.

01:46:57.084 --> 01:46:58.836
...his best friend.

01:47:02.089 --> 01:47:03.757
He's never been the same since.

01:47:03.757 --> 01:47:04.842
Yeah.

01:47:07.427 --> 01:47:09.513
To be at that funeral...

01:47:19.064 --> 01:47:21.900
I really did used to love flowers.

01:47:24.194 --> 01:47:25.529
Listen to me.

01:47:26.321 --> 01:47:28.031
As his sister,

01:47:28.031 --> 01:47:32.286
I wish more than anything
that you could find a way to forgive him.

01:47:35.038 --> 01:47:37.040
But, as your best friend,

01:47:38.542 --> 01:47:43.213
Lily, if you take him back,
I will never speak to you again.

01:47:49.511 --> 01:47:50.804
I'm so sorry.

01:47:51.847 --> 01:47:54.183
You're the best friend I ever had.

01:47:55.184 --> 01:47:56.810
I'll be an even better auntie.

01:48:02.107 --> 01:48:03.233
Sweetheart.

01:48:46.318 --> 01:48:47.903
- This side?
- That side.

01:48:47.903 --> 01:48:50.572
Yeah, if I hold it in like this,
I think it'll be a little easier.

01:48:50.572 --> 01:48:53.200
- Righty tighty, I think.
- Yep. Come on.

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:54.284
I'm sorry.

01:48:54.284 --> 01:48:55.369
No, no. You got it.

01:48:55.369 --> 01:48:57.496
Your dad always did this stuff.

01:48:57.496 --> 01:48:59.706
I'm sure you built a thing or two
in your life.

01:48:59.706 --> 01:49:02.668
No. No, no. That was always his domain.

01:49:06.129 --> 01:49:08.298
It doesn't wanna go in there.

01:49:14.054 --> 01:49:15.681
Why did you stay with him?

01:49:23.897 --> 01:49:25.983
It would've been harder to leave.

01:49:30.529 --> 01:49:31.780
And I loved him.

01:49:33.699 --> 01:49:34.950
Yeah, me too.

01:49:37.202 --> 01:49:38.495
I think I got it.

01:49:41.248 --> 01:49:43.542
And that's the heartbeat.

01:49:44.209 --> 01:49:46.837
Look at that. Do you wanna know?

01:49:46.837 --> 01:49:49.089
- You can tell already?
- I can.

01:49:52.885 --> 01:49:54.553
Okay.

01:49:54.553 --> 01:49:55.637
Yeah.

01:49:56.847 --> 01:49:58.473
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:49:58.473 --> 01:49:59.558
Okay.

01:50:01.435 --> 01:50:02.686
Can you see that?

01:50:03.312 --> 01:50:04.855
That's her little head.

01:50:11.737 --> 01:50:12.821
Hi.

01:50:13.697 --> 01:50:15.324
Hi, baby girl.

01:50:16.575 --> 01:50:17.951
"Her," huh?

01:50:22.998 --> 01:50:24.166
Hi.

01:50:25.918 --> 01:50:27.669
Hi, my baby girl.

01:50:52.736 --> 01:50:53.820
Hi.

01:51:06.124 --> 01:51:07.251
It's always--

01:51:11.171 --> 01:51:12.172
Thank you.

01:51:24.434 --> 01:51:25.602
Is she kicking?

01:51:26.228 --> 01:51:28.564
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

01:51:34.069 --> 01:51:35.279
All right.

01:51:36.029 --> 01:51:37.239
Sturdy.

01:51:37.239 --> 01:51:39.491
- Here you go. Grab this side.
- All right.

01:51:41.326 --> 01:51:42.327
Thank you.

01:51:43.662 --> 01:51:45.539
I can clean all this up, so...

01:51:45.539 --> 01:51:46.707
Okay.

01:52:02.264 --> 01:52:06.310
Do you wanna feel, before you go?
If you want?

01:52:09.188 --> 01:52:10.189
Is she kicking now?

01:52:10.981 --> 01:52:12.983
Always. Yeah.

01:52:13.817 --> 01:52:14.818
Yes.

01:52:14.818 --> 01:52:16.361
Yeah. Okay.

01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:20.073
Yeah, go ahead. Yeah.

01:52:22.951 --> 01:52:24.244
Here. Here.

01:52:26.663 --> 01:52:27.664
There she is.

01:52:27.664 --> 01:52:28.749
Yeah.

01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:33.795
Big old noggin. You feel that?
That's her little heel. You feel that?

01:52:34.922 --> 01:52:37.424
She's kinda stretching. Yeah.

01:52:45.015 --> 01:52:46.183
Come home.

01:52:49.228 --> 01:52:50.771
Look, I won't--

01:52:51.396 --> 01:52:53.190
It will never happen again.

01:52:54.024 --> 01:52:56.193
I promise. I will... I will get help.

01:52:58.862 --> 01:53:00.030
Please come home.

01:53:08.956 --> 01:53:10.958
- I'm s--
- You're gonna be late for work.

01:54:21.486 --> 01:54:24.072
Come. You wanna join us?

01:54:27.534 --> 01:54:29.203
Got room for one more.

01:54:30.495 --> 01:54:31.872
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:54:33.248 --> 01:54:36.293
I know. I got you. I got you.

01:54:39.338 --> 01:54:41.131
- Hey.
- Wanna hold her?

01:54:43.217 --> 01:54:44.218
Yeah.

01:54:44.218 --> 01:54:48.222
- Here you go. Like that.
- Hey. Hi.

01:54:48.889 --> 01:54:50.182
Mommy's got you.

01:54:50.182 --> 01:54:51.767
- Yeah.
- Mommy's got you.

01:54:51.767 --> 01:54:54.228
Still here.

01:54:54.228 --> 01:54:55.729
I know, I know.

01:54:55.729 --> 01:54:56.813
I know. It's okay.

01:54:57.731 --> 01:54:59.191
Keep her cozy.

01:55:00.442 --> 01:55:01.735
- Hi.
- There we go.

01:55:02.569 --> 01:55:04.738
- Hi, beautiful.
- There we go.

01:55:05.405 --> 01:55:06.573
I'm your daddy.

01:55:06.573 --> 01:55:09.743
Yeah. Yes, you are.

01:55:10.577 --> 01:55:11.745
Yeah.

01:55:13.288 --> 01:55:14.665
What should we call her?

01:55:16.041 --> 01:55:18.502
I was thinking we could name her
after your brother.

01:55:25.926 --> 01:55:28.679
- Emerson.
- Yeah. Emerson.

01:55:29.096 --> 01:55:31.306
That way, we can call her Emmy.

01:55:33.976 --> 01:55:35.310
What do you think?

01:55:37.187 --> 01:55:40.148
I think that's the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

01:55:42.901 --> 01:55:44.319
Thank you.

01:55:50.701 --> 01:55:53.370
It's okay. It's okay. Daddy's got you.

01:55:53.370 --> 01:55:55.539
Daddy's got you, Emmy.

01:55:56.915 --> 01:55:57.916
Hi.

01:55:59.084 --> 01:56:02.045
Hi, beautiful. I'm your daddy.

01:56:07.968 --> 01:56:09.595
I'm gonna keep you safe, Emmy.

01:56:11.305 --> 01:56:13.098
I'm gonna keep you safe.

01:56:21.523 --> 01:56:22.858
I want a divorce.

01:56:25.444 --> 01:56:27.988
Hey. Let's not.

01:56:27.988 --> 01:56:29.448
Hey, yes.

01:56:29.781 --> 01:56:31.116
Yeah.

01:56:32.284 --> 01:56:33.368
Yeah.

01:56:35.204 --> 01:56:37.247
It's not for you or me. It's for her.

01:56:38.707 --> 01:56:40.375
Yeah, you know.

01:56:41.627 --> 01:56:42.753
Look at her.

01:56:42.753 --> 01:56:46.673
What if, one day, she came to you
and said, "My boyfriend hit me"?

01:56:46.673 --> 01:56:48.050
What would you...

01:56:49.676 --> 01:56:51.136
What would you say to her?

01:56:54.515 --> 01:56:58.268
Or if she said, "Daddy, my husband
pushed me down the stairs,

01:56:58.268 --> 01:57:01.188
but he said it was an accident,
so it's fine."

01:57:04.066 --> 01:57:07.736
Or if she said her husband held her down
and she begged him to stop,

01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:10.072
but he swore he'd never do it again?

01:57:13.158 --> 01:57:14.826
What would you tell her?

01:57:17.454 --> 01:57:19.498
If the person she loved...

01:57:21.416 --> 01:57:22.417
was--

01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:26.004
was hurting her,
what would you say to her?

01:57:36.431 --> 01:57:38.141
I would beg her to leave him.

01:57:39.977 --> 01:57:41.019
Yeah.

01:57:42.437 --> 01:57:44.273
And I'd beg her never to go back.

01:57:53.282 --> 01:57:56.410
Wanna go to your mama?
You have such a good mama.

01:57:56.410 --> 01:57:57.494
Here.

01:58:01.456 --> 01:58:04.126
I got you, bug. I got you. Yes, my love.

01:58:04.126 --> 01:58:05.878
Okay. I'm gonna--

01:58:36.450 --> 01:58:37.451
Yeah.

01:58:39.203 --> 01:58:41.705
There you go, bug. Mama's got you.

01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:45.125
Mama's got you.

01:58:47.461 --> 01:58:48.754
Yeah.
