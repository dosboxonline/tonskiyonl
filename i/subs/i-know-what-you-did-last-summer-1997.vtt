[Julie] We've gotta call the police
and get an ambulance out here.

16:40.730 --> 16:43.065
Hey, hey, what's
your hurry?

16:43.132 --> 16:45.067
The guy's dead.

16:45.134 --> 16:48.437
You're not a doctor.
You don't make that decision.

16:48.504 --> 16:52.708
Use your brain, Julie.
We call the police, and we're fucked.

16:52.776 --> 16:56.511
- It was an accident.
- Look, let's think about this a minute.

16:56.580 --> 16:59.481
Think about what?
Think about what?

16:59.549 --> 17:02.451
He was crossing the road in the
middle of the night, okay?

17:02.518 --> 17:04.787
It was an accident.
You weren't drinking or speeding.

17:04.854 --> 17:06.789
<i>There's liquor all over the car.
But you're sober.</i>

17:06.856 --> 17:09.223
- They'll never believe I was driving.
- It's my car.

17:09.291 --> 17:12.426
They'll nail my ass.
That's not true.

17:12.494 --> 17:15.030
Are you kidding?
Look at me.

17:15.098 --> 17:17.633
I'm drunk as shit.
I'm fucked.

17:17.701 --> 17:20.135
No, we'll call the police.
We'll tell them the truth!

17:20.203 --> 17:22.738
- They'll believe us.
- It's manslaughter.

17:26.442 --> 17:30.980
- We're gonna fry no matter
who takes the fall.
- Then we leave right now.

17:31.047 --> 17:33.816
No way.
Are you crazy?

17:33.883 --> 17:38.253
- The grill's busted.
There's blood everywhere.
- We can clean it up. Come on.

17:38.321 --> 17:41.289
Listen to yourselves.
No, we are going to the police!

17:41.357 --> 17:45.127
We don't have time for your shit!
We gotta move fast!

17:45.194 --> 17:48.163
Hey! Now, let's try
to stay calm.

17:48.231 --> 17:51.834
Focus.
Don't you get it?

17:51.901 --> 17:54.402
If there's some of him on the car,
there's some of the car on him.

17:54.470 --> 17:58.306
They're gonna trace it back to you.
You're looking at a hit-and-run.

17:58.374 --> 18:00.475
Then we dump
the body.

18:00.543 --> 18:04.013
You've lost it.
Look, just pretend we were never here.

18:04.080 --> 18:06.715
We could drag him to the
water and dump him in.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.852
They wouldn't find
the fucker for weeks.

18:09.919 --> 18:12.021
By that time all the evidence
would be washed away.

18:12.088 --> 18:14.189
If they found him
at all.

18:17.994 --> 18:21.864
The currents are strong.
The undertow-- it could
carry him out to sea.

18:21.931 --> 18:26.168
[Sighs disgustedly]
I won't be any part of it.

18:26.235 --> 18:29.571
Look, I'm scared, Julie.
I'm not like the rest of you.

18:29.639 --> 18:33.441
I don't have your family or the
money to get me out of this.

18:33.509 --> 18:37.846
- Please.
- This is your future, Julie.

<i>College. There's
your scholarship.</i>

18:44.788 --> 18:48.290

If we go to the police, we're dead too.

19:25.161 --> 19:29.098
- Actually, um--
- [Retching noises, coughing]

19:29.165 --> 19:31.433
It's Barry.
He's had way too much to drink.

19:31.500 --> 19:34.469
And we're trying to keep the
upchuck out of the new car.

19:34.537 --> 19:39.141
<i>- [Max] Well, it doesn't look

- Yeah, don't drink and drive.</i>

[Laughs]

19:45.681 --> 19:50.485
- What can I do for you, Max?
- You can wipe that
"my shit don't stink" grin off.

19:54.791 --> 19:59.728
Okay, Max. Will do.
Have a good night.

20:00.864 --> 20:03.999
Y-you almost got
that rich boy act down, Ray.

20:04.067 --> 20:06.168
We'll be seeing you,
Max.

20:07.237 --> 20:10.672
Yep. Take care, Julie.

21:00.723 --> 21:04.159
[Barry] Even if his body washes
ashore in the next couple of weeks,

21:04.227 --> 21:07.229
it'll be eaten
by crabs and small fish.

21:09.032 --> 21:11.499
Maybe we'll get lucky
with a shark.

21:13.970 --> 21:16.438

- Wait.

21:31.754 --> 21:33.722

21:33.789 --> 21:36.391

- I don't know, okay?</i>

21:39.762 --> 21:42.998
