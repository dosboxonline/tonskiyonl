00:04.463 --> 00:07.591
<i>--Spring training camp and
he's definitely got the inside track.</i>

00:07.758 --> 00:10.344
<i>Word is that they're having
some problems with injuries.</i>

00:10.511 --> 00:12.095
<i>Really? are they looking into...</i>

00:12.262 --> 00:14.598
<i>...free-agent signings last second,
anything like that?</i>

00:14.765 --> 00:17.100
<i>Possibly, and they've got</i>
a <i>strong farm club too.</i>

00:17.267 --> 00:20.103
<i>They've got some triple-a ballplayers
they might bring up.</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:22.940
<i>Peter would certainly be able
to tell us more about that.</i>

00:23.106 --> 00:24.441
<i>Who do you like?</i>

00:24.608 --> 00:26.944
<i>So far,
i like what I'm seeing in New York.</i>

00:27.110 --> 00:30.197
<i>They've got a strong ball club, as usual.
That's in the American.</i>

00:30.364 --> 00:32.950
<i>And in the national,
I'm still liking Chicago...</i>

00:33.116 --> 00:35.577
<i>...with a little bit of a twist here
for Los Angeles.</i>

00:35.744 --> 00:38.622
<i>Okay, so we're looking at
New York-Chicago world series...</i>

00:38.789 --> 00:41.375
<i>- ...possible Los Angeles.
- Could be a dark horse.</i>

00:41.542 --> 00:43.460
<i>Hold him to it
at the end of the season.</i>

00:43.627 --> 00:45.754
<i>That's gonna do it for us
from the sports desk.</i>

00:45.921 --> 00:48.799
<i>- Back to the studio. Thanks, Dave.
- Thanks for nothing, Eddie.</i>

00:48.966 --> 00:53.595
<i>Thank you, guys. That's not all we're
following. Here's Karen at the health desk.</i>

00:54.263 --> 00:57.182
The world of medicine
has seen its share of miracle cures...

00:57.349 --> 00:59.977
...from the polio vaccine
to heart transplants...

01:00.143 --> 01:05.274
...but all past achievements may pale in
comparison to the work of Dr. Alice krippin.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.276
Thank you for joining us this morning.

01:07.442 --> 01:12.281
- Not at all.
- So, Dr. krippin, give it to me in a nutshell.

01:12.447 --> 01:15.158
Well, the premise is quite simple.

01:15.325 --> 01:18.662
Take something designed by nature
and reprogram it...

01:18.829 --> 01:22.165
...to make it work for the body
rather than against it.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.959
- We're talking about a virus?
- Yes.

01:24.126 --> 01:25.919
In this case, the measles virus...

01:26.086 --> 01:31.258
...which has been engineered at a genetic
level to be helpful rather than harmful.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.720
Um, I'm not-- I find the best way
to describe it is...

01:34.886 --> 01:37.389
...if you can imagine your body
as a highway...

01:37.556 --> 01:42.436
...and you picture the virus as a very fast
car being driven by a very bad man...

01:42.603 --> 01:45.647
...imagine the damage that
that car could cause.

01:45.814 --> 01:49.109
But then if you replace that man
with a cop...

01:49.276 --> 01:52.613
...the picture changes. And that's
essentially what we've done.

01:52.779 --> 01:55.073
Now, how many people
have you treated so far?

01:55.240 --> 01:58.869
Well, we've had 10,009 clinical trials
in humans so far.

01:59.036 --> 02:02.789
- And how many are cancer-free?
- Ten thousand and nine.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.084
So you have actually cured cancer?

02:06.251 --> 02:09.921
Yes, yes. Yes, we have.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.702
What you see? What you see?

04:48.538 --> 04:49.956
Damn.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.125
Let's go, Sam.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.545
Come on.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.868
<i>Good morning, Matt.
It's looking great, I'll tell you.</i>

08:55.035 --> 08:58.413
<i>Not only was this the biggest
snowstorm in New York City history...</i>

08:58.580 --> 09:01.958
<i>...it had to be one of the prettiest.
Imagine waking up on Sunday...</i>

09:02.125 --> 09:05.420
<i>...to 26.9 inches of snow
in New York City.</i>

09:05.587 --> 09:07.881
Here you go. Just the way you like it.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.133
Disgusting.

09:10.967 --> 09:13.553
Excuse me, excuse me.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.640
All right. Come on, relax.

09:17.932 --> 09:21.102
<i>However, it did strand
planes, trains and automobiles.</i>

09:21.269 --> 09:25.523
<i>There was a report, a turkish airlines
flight skidded off the runway at jfk.</i>

09:25.690 --> 09:28.485
<i>No one was injured,
but for the most part, Matt...</i>

09:28.651 --> 09:30.653
There you go.

09:32.822 --> 09:36.201
<i>I'm gonna show you, attempting
the Bob hager rule of thumb here.</i>

09:36.659 --> 09:38.870
<i>And I'm gonna plug my ruler in.</i>

09:39.037 --> 09:43.958
<i>In New York, in 30 rock,
we have 16 inches of snow, Matt.</i>

09:44.125 --> 09:45.502
<i>Back to you, Matt and Katie.</i>

09:45.668 --> 09:50.090
<i>Gosh. all right, it looks great. It'll be
beautiful for the next day, at least.</i>

09:50.256 --> 09:52.133
<i>- And then it turns brown.
- If that.</i>

09:52.300 --> 09:53.843
<i>Anyway, Ann, thanks so much.</i>

09:54.010 --> 09:57.514
Mm-mm. no, no, no. Eat your vegetables.

09:57.680 --> 10:00.767
Don't just push them around, eat them.
I'm not playing.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.394
<i>Good morning. This morning,
all up the east coast...</i>

10:03.561 --> 10:07.440
Okay. you gonna eat your vegetables.
We will sit down here all night.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.527
<i>The biggest challenge
is getting back to work.</i>

10:12.195 --> 10:15.949
What are you whining about?
Why didn't you just eat your vegetables?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.910
Hey. all right, here's the deal.
Look. Look.

10:19.077 --> 10:22.872
You're gonna eat twice as many vegetables
tomorrow night. All right?

10:23.039 --> 10:26.042
Deal? deal?

10:30.880 --> 10:32.382
Come on.

10:35.844 --> 10:40.390
Don't <i>worry</i>
about a <i>thing</i>

10:42.350 --> 10:46.604
<i>'cause every little thing
gonna be all right</i>

10:47.730 --> 10:49.983
I know that feels good.

10:51.526 --> 10:55.697
<i>Smiled with the rising sun
three little birds</i>

10:55.864 --> 10:58.074
ah, Sam.

11:01.244 --> 11:04.080
<i>Singin' sweet songs
of melody--</i>

11:33.526 --> 11:35.111
I'm all right.

11:35.278 --> 11:37.238
I'm all right, it's all right.

13:05.034 --> 13:08.371
What's happening? I tried to reach you
on your cell. I get a recording.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.290
- Cell service is down.
- Where are we going?

13:10.456 --> 13:13.042
- Can't get used to the new regs.
- Going to aunt Sara's.

13:13.209 --> 13:16.921
- Ma! no! Why?
- Baby, just strap yourself in. Go.

13:17.088 --> 13:20.091
- We're at 30 minutes, colonel.
- Copy.

13:20.675 --> 13:24.012
- Thirty minutes to what?
- They're sealing off the island.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.104
- Seal off the island? This island?
- But I don't wanna go to aunt Sara's.

13:33.271 --> 13:35.106
- Did you bring all the money?
- Yeah.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.607
- How much?
- Six hundred.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.067
Why did you say, "you're going"?

13:38.234 --> 13:39.569
- That's not enough.
- Robert.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.696
You said, "you're going,"
not, "we're going."

13:41.863 --> 13:45.742
When you get across, I need you to get
to the atm. Get as much cash as you can.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.703
Take Sara's car, go upstate.
I'll meet you at the farm.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.955
Bring enough food for two weeks.

13:51.122 --> 13:53.666
Jesus, Robert, did it jump?

13:53.916 --> 13:55.543
Is it airborne?

13:55.710 --> 13:58.671
But we only go to aunt Sara's
in the summer.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.631
- It may be.
- Oh, my god.

14:00.798 --> 14:04.552
- It's Christmas. What about my presents?
- He's announcing it.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.096
<i>Make no mistake, Americans, this virus--</i>

14:07.263 --> 14:09.182
you left my Christmas presents
in the closet.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.350
Hush now, mar.

14:10.516 --> 14:14.270
<i>--Threatens the survival of not only our
nation, but of every other nation--</i>

14:14.437 --> 14:16.731
- mommy, look, it's a butterfly.
- Marley, enough!

14:16.898 --> 14:21.444
<i>And so it is with great sadness,
but even greater resolve...</i>

14:21.611 --> 14:24.447
<i>...that tonight I have signed
an executive order...</i>

14:24.614 --> 14:28.826
<i>...initiating a military quarantine
of New York City.</i>

14:28.993 --> 14:30.953
<i>God be with us.</i>

14:31.120 --> 14:33.206
<i>This has been a special--</i>

14:35.041 --> 14:39.921
the window is still open. We find
something in a week or two weeks...

14:40.088 --> 14:43.591
...we can reverse the spread.

14:47.678 --> 14:49.972
I can still fix this.

14:50.973 --> 14:54.936
Please. you can do the same work
outside the city.

14:55.645 --> 15:00.900
This is ground zero. This is my site.
We talked about this.

15:01.192 --> 15:02.735
What are you doing?

15:04.987 --> 15:07.115
What am I doing?

15:08.699 --> 15:10.493
I'm not gonna let this happen.

15:10.660 --> 15:12.495
Let? this isn't up to you.
You can't control--

15:13.871 --> 15:15.540
ah! daddy, it's a monster!

15:29.929 --> 15:32.098
How'd you sleep?

16:06.632 --> 16:09.385
Look out. Come on,
you know better than that.

16:09.886 --> 16:11.053
Uh-uh.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.805
I'll be back.

16:45.796 --> 16:50.760
Dr. Robert Neville, September 5th, 2012,
ga series, serum 391.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.930
Animal trials. Streaming video.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.496
Ga series results appear typical.

17:23.626 --> 17:28.965
Compounds 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10...

17:29.131 --> 17:35.471
...11, 14, 16, 18 did not kill the virus.

17:35.638 --> 17:39.559
Compounds 2, 5, 7...

17:39.725 --> 17:43.980
...12,13,15,17...

17:44.230 --> 17:46.566
...all killed the host.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.407
Hold on a second.

17:59.662 --> 18:03.082
Compound 6 appears to be showing
decreased aggression response.

18:04.667 --> 18:07.420
Partial pigmentation return.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.506
Slight pupil constriction.

18:11.549 --> 18:15.011
Ga series, serum 391, compound 6...

18:15.177 --> 18:17.221
...next candidate for human trials.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.932
You hang in there, number six.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.061
Yeah, that's what you want.

19:28.334 --> 19:29.794
Hey!

19:29.960 --> 19:32.880
Good morning, Marge.
Good morning, Fred.

19:33.047 --> 19:35.591
What are you guys doing here so early?

19:36.092 --> 19:40.388
That's a nice sweatshirt there, Fred.
Don't set it down anywhere.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.561
I'll see you guys inside.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.115
What's happening, buddy?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.841
Yes.

20:40.531 --> 20:43.075
Good morning, Hank.
I'm midway through the g's.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.122
Hey, who's the girl in...?

20:52.001 --> 20:54.670
Never mind.
Hey, I'll see you in the morning.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.218
<i>What am I supposed to say?</i>

21:01.844 --> 21:03.554
"Hello.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.307
Wanna see some infected rats?"

21:12.521 --> 21:16.317
Okay, tomorrow.
I'm gonna say hello tomorrow.

21:25.576 --> 21:27.203
Psst.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.385

Look at that. See that? Red salmon.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.706
Wow, actual spam. Yeah.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.875
You'll get some of that later.

23:18.981 --> 23:20.608

You gotta pay attention.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.191
Listen, uh...

32:24.276 --> 32:27.279
...i want you to stay here
on this one, okay?

32:29.698 --> 32:32.409
Because you can still get infected.

32:33.201 --> 32:35.036
And I can't.

35:56.780 --> 35:58.239
Respiration slowing.

35:59.824 --> 36:03.411
Pulse, 190. Core temperature...

36:04.079 --> 36:06.122
...105...

36:06.289 --> 36:08.792
...104 and decreasing.

36:11.211 --> 36:12.879
We may have something here.

36:58.550 --> 37:04.472
Ga series, serum 391, compound 6
ineffective on humans.

37:23.158 --> 37:27.829
Test results linked to this entry
saved on six redundant drives.

37:27.996 --> 37:29.998
Still no cure.

37:46.848 --> 37:49.392
Day 1001.

37:49.559 --> 37:52.687
<i>We came in close contact
with a hive today.</i>

37:52.854 --> 37:56.608
<i>Blood tests confirm that
i remain immune to both the airborne...</i>

37:57.066 --> 37:59.527
...and contact strains.

37:59.694 --> 38:04.574
Canines remain immune
to airborne strain only.

38:06.659 --> 38:09.913
You can't go running
into the dark, dummy.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.708
Vaccine trials continue.

38:13.875 --> 38:17.962
I'm still unable to transfer my immunity
to infected hosts.

38:18.129 --> 38:21.382
The krippin virus is...

38:21.549 --> 38:23.551
...elegant.

38:28.598 --> 38:31.726
Just fishing in the dark, son.

38:34.687 --> 38:38.608
Mm. a behavioral note, um:

38:39.609 --> 38:44.113
An infected male
exposed himself to sunlight today.

38:45.740 --> 38:49.077
Now, it's possible
decreased brain function...

38:49.244 --> 38:54.374
...or the growing scarcity of food
is causing them to...

38:55.542 --> 38:59.462
...ignore their basic survival instincts.

39:02.215 --> 39:05.844
Social de-evolution appears complete.

39:06.344 --> 39:11.266
Typical human behavior
is now entirely absent.

39:18.147 --> 39:19.649
Why are we stopping?

39:24.112 --> 39:26.155
The street's closed, folks. We hoof it.

39:26.322 --> 39:29.617
- We got less than 10 minutes.
- Baby, give me the dog.

39:33.246 --> 39:35.206
- Come on, baby. Let's go. Let's go.
- Daddy!

39:35.373 --> 39:37.709
It's all right. It's all right. Come on.

39:38.167 --> 39:41.546
Keep the colonel and his family
between us and don't let anyone stop you.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.131
Mommy, they have guns!

39:43.298 --> 39:45.300
It's okay. They're in the army like daddy.

39:45.466 --> 39:47.552
Unless you have clearance...

39:47.719 --> 39:51.139
<i>...you cannot pass the checkpoint.
Please return to your homes.</i>

39:51.306 --> 39:54.684
Make a hole, make a hole!
Coming through!

40:00.315 --> 40:02.317
Coming through!

40:33.848 --> 40:37.352
<i>Unless you have clearance,
you cannot pass the checkpoint.</i>

40:37.518 --> 40:39.562
<i>Please return to your homes.</i>

40:45.360 --> 40:47.612
You're clear. Move ahead.

40:48.029 --> 40:49.072
You're clear.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.824
All right, that's it, move up.

40:52.659 --> 40:54.369
All right, step up.

40:54.869 --> 40:57.121
You're clear. Next. Let's go.

40:58.373 --> 40:59.791
No good.

40:59.958 --> 41:03.002
<i>Military quarantine is about to begin.</i>

41:04.545 --> 41:06.089
Come on, step back.

41:06.255 --> 41:09.092
<i>- Military quarantine is about to begin.
- Look, look, look.</i>

41:09.258 --> 41:11.219
- I'm not infected.
- Clear. Good, go on.

41:11.386 --> 41:12.512
I'm not infected.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.097
Please! please!

41:14.263 --> 41:18.017
- Please take my baby. Take my baby, please.
- You're gonna have to move back.

41:20.061 --> 41:21.562
- No good.
- Follow me, ma'am.

41:21.729 --> 41:25.066
What? no! Robert! Robert!

41:25.233 --> 41:27.402
Get your hands off my wife.
Get your hands off.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.946
- Mommy!
- stand down.

41:30.113 --> 41:31.155
Lieutenant--

41:31.322 --> 41:33.992
- mommy!
- scan her again. Get your hands off of her!

41:34.158 --> 41:35.618
Get your hands off of my wife.

41:35.785 --> 41:38.121
- Stand down!
- Scan her again. Stand down!

41:38.287 --> 41:40.915
Stand down, soldier! Stand down!

41:41.082 --> 41:44.669
I am lieutenant colonel Robert Neville.
I am ordering you to scan her again.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.546
Scan her again!

41:50.091 --> 41:52.135
All right, scan her again.

41:55.138 --> 41:57.932
- It's clear.
- It's clear. Move through.

42:00.309 --> 42:01.477
Who's next? Come on.

42:01.644 --> 42:04.564
Take my baby with you!
Please! Please!

42:04.731 --> 42:07.942
- Mommy!
- please take my baby. Please!

42:09.360 --> 42:13.114
Daddy, why can't the little girl come too?

42:13.656 --> 42:15.867
<i>Stay away from the shoreline.</i>

42:16.034 --> 42:17.702
How long?

42:18.202 --> 42:20.121
Five minutes. We'll make it.

42:20.288 --> 42:23.458
This is ranger 621, we're on site.

42:24.042 --> 42:27.211
<i>Military quarantine is about to begin.</i>

42:39.307 --> 42:44.312
I won't take my eyes off them, colonel.
You got my word on it.

42:49.192 --> 42:50.818
Give me a kiss.

43:01.287 --> 43:03.956
<i>I love you. I love you.</i>

43:04.665 --> 43:07.502
Dear lord, please watch over Robert...

43:07.668 --> 43:10.004
...and keep him strong
through the struggles ahead.

43:10.171 --> 43:14.217
Lord, please just bring him home safely.
Amen.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.221
Daddy's gonna make the monsters
go away, baby, okay?

43:18.387 --> 43:20.681
Sam, you protect daddy.

43:20.848 --> 43:24.852
- No, baby, I can't. Daddy can't take a dog.
- Sir, we gotta go!

43:27.563 --> 43:30.942
Daddy, look, it's a butterfly.

43:31.567 --> 43:33.861
<i>It's</i> a <i>butterfly.</i>

43:36.364 --> 43:38.407
All right, come on, let's go!

44:24.620 --> 44:26.164
How'd you sleep?

44:26.330 --> 44:29.458
<i>Dr. Neville will be taking a closer look
at the ongoing mutations...</i>

44:29.625 --> 44:34.547
...of <i>Dr. Alice krippin's once-hailed
miracle cure for cancer.</i>

44:34.714 --> 44:38.843
<i>So far, almost 5000 patients
treated with her retrofitted virus...</i>

44:39.010 --> 44:42.847
<i>...have begun exhibiting symptoms
resembling the early onset of rabies.</i>

44:43.014 --> 44:45.808
<i>Twenty-five patients have already died.</i>

44:45.975 --> 44:50.188
<i>Dr. Neville has ordered local hospitals
to stockpile antiviral drugs...</i>

44:50.354 --> 44:53.274
<i>...and to begin
preliminary quarantine protocols.</i>

44:53.441 --> 44:55.026
It's my birthday.

44:55.193 --> 44:58.571
<i>We are fully confident Dr. Neville
can see us through these--</i>

44:58.738 --> 45:00.448
you gonna sing?

45:01.365 --> 45:03.784
<i>My name is Robert Neville.</i>

45:04.327 --> 45:07.538
<i>I am a survivor living in New York City.</i>

45:09.540 --> 45:13.294
<i>I am broadcasting on all am frequencies.</i>

45:13.920 --> 45:17.548
<i>I will be at the south street seaport
every day at midday...</i>

45:17.715 --> 45:20.551
<i>...when the sun is highest in the sky.</i>

45:21.719 --> 45:26.807
<i>If you are out there,
if anyone is out there...</i>

45:26.974 --> 45:31.145
<i>I can provide food. I can provide shelter.</i>

45:31.312 --> 45:34.065
<i>I can provide security.</i>

45:34.232 --> 45:37.735
<i>If there's anybody out there, anybody...</i>

45:40.071 --> 45:41.864
<i>Please.</i>

45:42.490 --> 45:44.492
<i>You are not alone.</i>

45:45.493 --> 45:47.078
Listen, uh...

45:47.245 --> 45:50.623
...if you're planning a party or something,
just tell me now.

45:50.915 --> 45:53.668
Okay? because you know
i don't like surprises.

45:53.834 --> 45:57.463
And I swear I'll act surprised. Okay?

46:27.451 --> 46:29.203
Hey! hey!

46:42.341 --> 46:45.428
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

46:48.014 --> 46:51.142
What the--? What the hell are you--?
No!

46:51.600 --> 46:54.020
No! no!

46:56.230 --> 46:57.565
No.

46:57.732 --> 47:00.568
What the hell
are you doing out here, Fred?!

47:00.943 --> 47:03.237
How did you get out here?!

47:03.404 --> 47:06.574
Fred, if you're real,
you better tell me right now!

47:06.741 --> 47:10.161
If you're real,
you better tell me right now!

47:23.132 --> 47:25.259
Damn it, Fred!

47:25.801 --> 47:27.803
Damn it!

49:28.299 --> 49:31.719
I'm all right. I'm all right, I'm all right.

49:57.536 --> 50:00.414
I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right.

50:25.773 --> 50:28.400
Baby. I'm okay.

50:29.318 --> 50:32.488
I'm okay. I'm okay.

51:50.107 --> 51:51.859
Let's go.

51:52.026 --> 51:54.987
Eh, eh! Come on. Sam, come on.

52:07.416 --> 52:08.542
Let's go! Sam!

52:18.802 --> 52:20.554
No! no! Let's go!

52:20.721 --> 52:23.474
We gotta go home, Sam. Let's go!

52:52.252 --> 52:53.712
Sam!

53:00.094 --> 53:01.970
No!

53:25.661 --> 53:28.080
Sam? Sam?

53:30.833 --> 53:32.209
It's okay.

53:32.376 --> 53:35.462
You're all right. Okay. It's okay.

53:35.629 --> 53:38.132
You're all right. You're all right.

53:38.507 --> 53:41.260
Samantha? Samantha, look at me, girl.

53:41.427 --> 53:45.639
Hey. you're okay.
You're okay. Samantha.

53:45.806 --> 53:48.976
We just gotta get you home.
Gotta get you-- gotta take you home.

53:49.143 --> 53:51.729
Let me take you home.
All right, come here.

53:51.895 --> 53:54.356
Come here. Come here. Come here.

54:29.266 --> 54:30.851
Come on. Come here. Come here.

54:31.101 --> 54:33.437
I got you. I got you.

54:40.444 --> 54:42.196
It's okay.

54:43.071 --> 54:44.823
You're okay.

54:52.873 --> 54:54.625
Don't <i>worry</i>

54:56.835 --> 54:58.962
<i>about a thing</i>

55:00.005 --> 55:05.177
<i>'cause every little thing
is gonna be all right</i>

55:08.639 --> 55:14.269
<i>don't worry
about a thing</i>

55:19.066 --> 55:21.527
<i>rise up this morning</i>

55:23.153 --> 55:25.739
<i>smiled with the rising sun</i>

55:32.079 --> 55:34.081
<i>three little birds</i>

58:37.305 --> 58:39.766
I promised my friend...

58:41.393 --> 58:46.565
...that I would say hello to you today.

58:51.236 --> 58:52.946
Hello.

59:00.704 --> 59:02.414
Hello.

59:12.883 --> 59:15.677
Please say hello to me.

59:22.559 --> 59:25.312
Please say hello to me.

1:00:45.809 --> 1:00:47.394
Die!

1:00:47.686 --> 1:00:48.770
Die!

1:01:02.784 --> 1:01:04.536
Die!

1:02:44.469 --> 1:02:47.847
Come on! Stay with me!

1:02:49.391 --> 1:02:51.977
Where do you live?

1:02:53.812 --> 1:02:55.689
Hey.

1:02:56.147 --> 1:02:57.691
Hey!

1:02:57.857 --> 1:02:59.985
Stay with me.

1:03:00.860 --> 1:03:03.154
Where do you live?

1:03:06.116 --> 1:03:08.660
Where do you live?

1:03:09.411 --> 1:03:10.662
Uh...

1:03:10.829 --> 1:03:15.041
11 Washington square.

1:03:15.542 --> 1:03:18.295
They don't know where I live.

1:03:19.212 --> 1:03:22.674
Don't-- don't let them track us.

1:03:23.091 --> 1:03:25.635
You gotta stay out till dawn.

1:04:29.491 --> 1:04:30.492
No!

1:04:32.077 --> 1:04:33.995
<i><i>Donkey?</i></i>

1:04:34.954 --> 1:04:36.081
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1:04:36.247 --> 1:04:39.584
<i>I would think of all people you would
recognize a wall when you see one.</i>

1:04:39.751 --> 1:04:44.506
<i>Well, yeah. But the wall's supposed to go
around my swamp, not through it.</i>

1:04:44.672 --> 1:04:47.634
<i>It is. Around your half, see?
That's your half, this is my half.</i>

1:04:47.801 --> 1:04:51.388
- Oh, your half? Hm.
- Yes, my half.

1:04:51.554 --> 1:04:55.183
<i>I helped rescue the Princess. I did
half the work. I get half the Booty.</i>

1:04:55.350 --> 1:04:58.728
<i>Now hand me that big old rock,
the one that looks like your head.</i>

1:04:58.895 --> 1:05:01.022
<i>- Shrek". back off!
- No, you back off.</i>

1:05:01.189 --> 1:05:03.274
<i>Shrek". this is my swamp!
Donkey". Our swamp.</i>

1:05:06.111 --> 1:05:08.905
<i>- Smelly ogre.
Shrek". Fine!</i>

1:05:09.614 --> 1:05:11.324
<i>Come back,
I'm not through with you!</i>

1:05:11.491 --> 1:05:12.992
<i>Well, I'm through with you.</i>

1:05:13.159 --> 1:05:16.287
<i>You know, with you
it's always "me, me, me."</i>

1:05:16.454 --> 1:05:21.501
<i>Well, guess what, now it's my turn.
So you just shut up and pay attention!</i>

1:05:21.668 --> 1:05:25.839
<i>You are mean to me! You insult me and
you don't appreciate anything that I do.</i>

1:05:26.005 --> 1:05:28.425
<i>You're always pushing me around
or pushing me</i> away.

1:05:28.591 --> 1:05:32.971
<i>Oh, yeah? Well, if I treated you so bad,
how come you came back?</i>

1:05:33.138 --> 1:05:36.307
<i>Because that's what friends do!
They forgive each other!</i>

1:05:36.683 --> 1:05:38.351
<i>O h , yea h .</i>

1:05:38.518 --> 1:05:40.854
<i>You're right, donkey. I forgive you...</i>

1:05:41.020 --> 1:05:42.522
<i>...for stabbing me in the back!</i>

1:05:45.859 --> 1:05:49.362
<i>Donkey". you're so wrapped up in layers,
you're afraid of your own feelings.</i>

1:05:49.529 --> 1:05:50.697
<i>- Go away.
- See?</i>

1:05:50.864 --> 1:05:53.032
<i>Doing it again,
just like you did to Fiona...</i>

1:05:53.199 --> 1:05:55.368
<i>...and all she did was like you,
maybe love you.</i>

1:05:55.535 --> 1:06:00.039
<i>Shrek". love me? She said I was ugly,
a hideous creature.</i>

1:06:00.206 --> 1:06:01.833
<i>I heard the two of you talking.</i>

1:06:02.000 --> 1:06:06.838
<i>She wasn't talking about you,
she was talking about somebody else.</i>

1:06:15.889 --> 1:06:18.349
I'm afraid the eggs are powdered.

1:06:18.516 --> 1:06:20.560
Obviously you know that.

1:06:21.394 --> 1:06:22.604
They're yours.

1:06:22.770 --> 1:06:27.775
But I did find bacon, which is about
the most fantastic thing in history.

1:06:27.942 --> 1:06:31.738
And some antibiotics in the bathroom.

1:06:31.905 --> 1:06:34.282
I put by your plate,
because your leg is okay...

1:06:34.449 --> 1:06:38.661
...but it won't be for very long
if you don't start a course soon.

1:06:39.954 --> 1:06:41.748
Who are you?

1:06:43.249 --> 1:06:45.793
I'm Anna and that's Ethan.

1:06:52.884 --> 1:06:55.011
Don't let it get cold.

1:07:07.941 --> 1:07:10.693
It's okay. Go on.

1:07:35.843 --> 1:07:39.973
We came from Maryland.
We heard your message on the radio.

1:07:40.640 --> 1:07:43.726
We were at the pier at noon.
We waited all day.

1:07:45.687 --> 1:07:48.147
We're going to Vermont.

1:07:48.815 --> 1:07:51.484
To the survivors' colony.

1:07:52.068 --> 1:07:53.653
What?

1:07:54.612 --> 1:07:58.241
In bethel. It's a safe zone.

1:07:58.408 --> 1:08:00.868
There's no survivors' colony,
there's no safe zones.

1:08:01.035 --> 1:08:03.079
Nothing happened
the way it was supposed to.

1:08:03.246 --> 1:08:05.164
Nothing worked
the way it was supposed to.

1:08:05.331 --> 1:08:09.919
In the mountains. There's a whole colony
of people there who didn't get sick.

1:08:10.086 --> 1:08:12.630
The virus couldn't survive the cold.
There's a colony--

1:08:12.797 --> 1:08:15.008
shut up! Shut up!

1:08:15.174 --> 1:08:16.634
Everybody's dead.

1:08:16.843 --> 1:08:18.928
Everybody is dead.

1:08:26.853 --> 1:08:29.981
I just need--
i need a minute. Okay?

1:08:31.566 --> 1:08:33.109
Just...

1:08:37.030 --> 1:08:39.907
I just-- I was saving that bacon.

1:08:41.492 --> 1:08:42.785
I was saving it.

1:08:45.622 --> 1:08:48.082
I'm just-- I'm gonna go upstairs.
All right? Just--

1:08:48.249 --> 1:08:50.293
I'm gonna go.

1:09:08.394 --> 1:09:11.064
Ethan, put the knife down.

1:09:46.057 --> 1:09:49.977
<i><i>- You there!</i> Ogre.
<i>- Aye.</i></i>

1:09:50.144 --> 1:09:52.313
<i>By the order of lord farquaad...</i>

1:09:52.480 --> 1:09:54.899
<i>...i am authorized
to place you both under arrest...</i>

1:09:55.066 --> 1:10:00.863
<i>...and transport you
to a designated resettlement facility.</i>

1:10:01.030 --> 1:10:05.410
<i>Oh, really? You and what army?</i>

1:10:16.671 --> 1:10:18.339
Can I say something to you?

1:10:18.506 --> 1:10:21.509
You was really, really something
back there. Incredible.

1:10:21.843 --> 1:10:23.886
Are you talking to...

1:10:25.012 --> 1:10:26.055
...me?

1:10:27.473 --> 1:10:30.727
Yes, I was talking to you.
You was really great back there.

1:10:30.893 --> 1:10:34.147
Those guards, they thought they was
all that. You showed up, and barn!

1:10:34.313 --> 1:10:36.566
Tripping over themselves
like babes in the woods.

1:10:36.733 --> 1:10:38.776
That really made me
feel good to see that.

1:10:38.943 --> 1:10:41.154
That's great. Really.
Man, it's good to be free.

1:10:41.612 --> 1:10:45.450
Now, why don't you go celebrate
your freedom with your own friends?

1:10:45.616 --> 1:10:47.118
Hm?

1:10:47.285 --> 1:10:48.703
But, uh...

1:10:48.953 --> 1:10:50.496
...i don't have any friends.

1:10:50.663 --> 1:10:53.166
And I'm not going out there by myself.

1:10:53.332 --> 1:10:55.960
Wait a minute. I got a great idea.
I'll stick with you!

1:10:56.127 --> 1:10:57.879
<i>You</i> a <i>mean, green fighting machine.</i>

1:10:58.045 --> 1:11:01.174
<i>Together we'll scare the spit
out of anybody that crosses us.</i>

1:11:04.385 --> 1:11:05.678
I like Shrek.

1:11:05.845 --> 1:11:08.264
<i>Donkey". that was really scary.
If you don't mind me saying...</i>

1:11:08.431 --> 1:11:11.184
<i>...if that don't work, your breath
will get the job done...</i>

1:11:11.350 --> 1:11:15.271
<i>...because you definitely need some
tic tacs, because your breath stinks!</i>

1:11:15.855 --> 1:11:19.901
<i>Man, you almost burned the hair
out of my nose. Just like the time...</i>

1:11:22.361 --> 1:11:25.031
You're not so good with people anymore,
are you?

1:11:30.453 --> 1:11:32.997
Thank you for my leg.

1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:37.251
Okay.

1:11:40.338 --> 1:11:41.881
Where have you been?

1:11:42.089 --> 1:11:45.676
I was on a red cross evacuation ship
out of Sao Paulo.

1:11:45.843 --> 1:11:48.930
Those boats
weren't meant to be permanent.

1:11:49.096 --> 1:11:50.681
No, they weren't.

1:11:50.848 --> 1:11:53.851
When the Navy fell apart,
we started docking to take on supplies.

1:11:54.018 --> 1:11:57.772
Someone picked it up on shore.
Five of us were immune.

1:11:57.939 --> 1:11:59.607
You said five?

1:12:00.274 --> 1:12:02.652
The darkseekers got them.

1:12:05.029 --> 1:12:07.657
You are the Robert Neville, aren't you?

1:12:16.499 --> 1:12:17.875
It's too late today.

1:12:18.042 --> 1:12:21.170
If we leave tomorrow at dawn, we can
make it to Vermont in a straight shot.

1:12:21.337 --> 1:12:23.798
- So if you had--
- I'm not leaving.

1:12:24.674 --> 1:12:27.009
This is ground zero.

1:12:28.427 --> 1:12:30.596
This is my site.

1:12:32.265 --> 1:12:34.767
I'm not gonna let this happen.

1:12:36.936 --> 1:12:39.230
I can still fix this.

1:12:52.034 --> 1:12:56.706
- Whoa. you scared me.
- Sorry.

1:12:56.873 --> 1:12:58.207
I called down twice.

1:12:58.374 --> 1:13:01.043
Oh. oh, thank you.

1:13:05.715 --> 1:13:09.302
It's heavily sedated.
Don't worry, it's safe.

1:13:09.468 --> 1:13:12.221
I've never seen one so still.

1:13:12.805 --> 1:13:15.516
They're always biting.

1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:21.856
You think that can cure her?

1:13:22.023 --> 1:13:24.984
Um... no, this will
almost certainly kill it...

1:13:25.151 --> 1:13:28.362
...but it's possible by drastically reducing
the body temperature...

1:13:28.529 --> 1:13:31.532
...i can increase the compounds
effectiveness.

1:13:42.835 --> 1:13:45.129
Did all of them die?

1:13:45.338 --> 1:13:46.923
Yes.

1:13:50.009 --> 1:13:52.011
My god.

1:13:52.845 --> 1:13:56.557
God didn't do this, Anna, we did.

1:14:01.896 --> 1:14:04.231
Where can Ethan sleep?

1:14:22.917 --> 1:14:24.794
He's heavy.

1:14:31.300 --> 1:14:33.094
Can you get that?

1:15:04.917 --> 1:15:07.211
She's beautiful.

1:15:07.670 --> 1:15:09.588
What's her name?

1:15:11.257 --> 1:15:13.175
Marley.

1:15:14.427 --> 1:15:18.014
- Her name was Marley.
- It's a beautiful name.

1:15:19.932 --> 1:15:23.936
Yeah. we named her after Bob Marley.

1:15:24.103 --> 1:15:27.440
- Who?
- uh, the singer.

1:15:28.482 --> 1:15:30.234
Damian?

1:15:31.485 --> 1:15:33.529
Uh, his father.

1:15:36.782 --> 1:15:39.076
His father.

1:15:40.119 --> 1:15:41.287
Nope.

1:15:41.454 --> 1:15:43.539
<i>I shot the sheriff</i>

1:15:46.834 --> 1:15:49.795
<i>but I didn't shoot the deputy</i>

1:15:57.303 --> 1:16:02.349
- oh, that is unacceptable.
- What?

1:16:06.979 --> 1:16:09.482
Best album ever made.

1:16:18.824 --> 1:16:21.911
- You don't recognize that?
- Mm-mm.

1:16:23.204 --> 1:16:24.455
Wow.

1:16:26.624 --> 1:16:32.171
He had this idea,
it was kind of a virologist's idea.

1:16:32.338 --> 1:16:37.009
He believed that you could cure
racism and hate. Literally cure it...

1:16:37.176 --> 1:16:43.307
...by injecting music and love
into people's lives.

1:16:44.141 --> 1:16:48.020
One day, he was scheduled
to perform at a peace rally.

1:16:48.187 --> 1:16:52.149
Gunmen came to his house
and shot him down.

1:16:53.984 --> 1:16:55.319
Two days later...

1:16:55.945 --> 1:16:59.573
...he walked out on that stage and sang.

1:17:01.367 --> 1:17:03.786
Somebody asked him why.

1:17:05.579 --> 1:17:08.040
He said, "the people...

1:17:08.207 --> 1:17:13.295
...who are trying to make this world worse
are not taking a day off.

1:17:14.463 --> 1:17:16.465
How can I?"

1:17:19.552 --> 1:17:22.388
Light up the darkness.

1:17:48.414 --> 1:17:50.624
Come with us, Neville.

1:17:51.208 --> 1:17:53.252
To the colony.

1:17:56.922 --> 1:17:59.383
There's no colony, Anna.

1:18:03.679 --> 1:18:05.222
Everything just fell apart.

1:18:05.389 --> 1:18:09.101
- There was no evacuation plan--
- you're wrong. There is a colony.

1:18:09.643 --> 1:18:11.687
I know, okay?

1:18:13.105 --> 1:18:14.356
How do you know, Anna?

1:18:20.863 --> 1:18:21.947
I just know.

1:18:24.200 --> 1:18:28.329
How? I said, how do you know?
How could you know?

1:18:30.039 --> 1:18:31.373
God told me.

1:18:31.874 --> 1:18:33.876
He has a plan.

1:18:35.628 --> 1:18:38.214
- God told you?
- Yes.

1:18:38.380 --> 1:18:41.133
- The god?
- Yes.

1:18:42.676 --> 1:18:45.137
- I know how this sounds.
- It sounds crazy.

1:18:45.304 --> 1:18:49.099
But something told me
to turn on the radio.

1:18:49.266 --> 1:18:50.893
Something told me to come here.

1:18:51.060 --> 1:18:53.854
My voice on the radio
told you to come here, Anna.

1:18:54.021 --> 1:18:56.065
You were trying to kill yourself
last night?

1:18:56.232 --> 1:18:57.233
Anna.

1:18:57.399 --> 1:19:00.569
I got here just in time to save your life.
That's a coincidence?

1:19:00.736 --> 1:19:04.365
- Just stop it. Stop it. Stop.
- He must have sent me here for a reason.

1:19:05.532 --> 1:19:08.577
Neville, the world is quieter now.

1:19:08.744 --> 1:19:10.829
You just have to listen.

1:19:10.996 --> 1:19:13.165
If we listen...

1:19:13.832 --> 1:19:15.793
...we can hear god's plan.

1:19:16.001 --> 1:19:18.003
- God's plan?
- Yeah.

1:19:18.170 --> 1:19:20.756
All right. Let me tell you
about your god's plan.

1:19:20.923 --> 1:19:23.842
There were 6 billion people on earth
when the infection hit.

1:19:24.009 --> 1:19:28.597
Kv had a 90 percent kill rate.
That's 5.4 billion...

1:19:28.764 --> 1:19:31.225
...people dead.

1:19:31.392 --> 1:19:34.228
Crashed and bled out, dead.

1:19:34.395 --> 1:19:36.272
Less than 1 percent immunity.

1:19:36.438 --> 1:19:40.234
That left 12 million healthy people
like you, me and Ethan.

1:19:40.401 --> 1:19:44.530
The other 588 million...

1:19:44.697 --> 1:19:46.699
...turned into your darkseekers.

1:19:46.865 --> 1:19:48.575
And then they got hungry.

1:19:48.742 --> 1:19:53.163
And they killed and fed on everybody.

1:19:54.331 --> 1:19:56.417
Everybody!

1:19:57.126 --> 1:20:02.089
Every single person
that you or I has ever known...

1:20:02.256 --> 1:20:04.216
...is dead!

1:20:06.552 --> 1:20:08.429
Dead!

1:20:09.763 --> 1:20:12.516
There is no god. There is no god.

1:20:17.813 --> 1:20:19.648
What is that?

1:20:22.985 --> 1:20:26.322
Was it still dark when you
brought us home last night?

1:20:26.488 --> 1:20:29.575
You were bleeding.
There was light on the horizon.

1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:33.912
Turn the light off. Turn it off.

1:20:41.170 --> 1:20:42.588
They followed us home.

1:20:42.755 --> 1:20:44.423
Ethan.

1:21:30.636 --> 1:21:32.304
Shit.

1:21:44.983 --> 1:21:46.652
Anna.

1:21:48.153 --> 1:21:49.988
Anna.

1:21:54.743 --> 1:21:56.370
Anna!

1:22:08.006 --> 1:22:09.925
Anna!

1:22:13.345 --> 1:22:14.930
Anna!

1:24:01.370 --> 1:24:02.996
Anna?

1:24:06.959 --> 1:24:08.710
Anna.

1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:08.770
Come on. Come on.

1:25:09.813 --> 1:25:11.773
- Are you okay? You all right?
- Yeah.

1:25:11.940 --> 1:25:13.483
Are you all right?

1:25:14.109 --> 1:25:16.236
- You okay?
- Oh, my god. You're bleeding.

1:25:29.875 --> 1:25:32.502
Go to the lab. Downstairs, go!

1:25:32.753 --> 1:25:35.547
Get to the lab! To the lab!

1:25:44.890 --> 1:25:45.932
Get behind the plexi.

1:25:46.767 --> 1:25:48.435
Oh, my god. Come on.

1:26:01.031 --> 1:26:02.783
Come on, it's okay. It's okay.

1:26:04.576 --> 1:26:06.370
Oh, my god.

1:26:18.840 --> 1:26:20.842
It's working.

1:26:25.180 --> 1:26:26.556
Neville...

1:26:27.849 --> 1:26:29.643
...it's working.

1:26:34.940 --> 1:26:36.775
No! stop! Stop!

1:26:38.068 --> 1:26:40.362
Look, look, look, I can save you.

1:26:40.529 --> 1:26:43.990
I can sa-- I can help you.
You are sick and I can help you.

1:26:47.119 --> 1:26:49.079
I can-- I can fix this!

1:26:49.246 --> 1:26:50.789
I can save everybody!

1:26:50.956 --> 1:26:54.167
I can fix everything! It's working.
It's working!

1:26:57.421 --> 1:26:58.839
Stop! stop!

1:27:04.970 --> 1:27:08.432
Let me save you! Let me save you!

1:27:08.598 --> 1:27:09.599
No, no!

1:27:20.402 --> 1:27:21.737
No, no!

1:27:38.670 --> 1:27:40.881
<i>Daddy, look, it's</i> a <i>butterfly.</i>

1:28:07.032 --> 1:28:08.617
Robert.

1:28:08.909 --> 1:28:11.661
- What are you doing?
- The cure is in her blood.

1:28:16.208 --> 1:28:18.668
Coal chute. I think it'll be safe.
Ethan, get in!

1:28:19.044 --> 1:28:20.420
- Go.
- come on, get in.

1:28:20.587 --> 1:28:22.464
- Get in.
- Anna.

1:28:26.134 --> 1:28:28.553
I think this is why you're here.

1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:33.350
What are you doing?

1:28:33.517 --> 1:28:35.560
I'm listening.

1:28:36.186 --> 1:28:38.021
- Neville, there's room. Come!
- No.

1:28:38.188 --> 1:28:41.149
They're not gonna stop.
They're not gonna stop.

1:28:44.069 --> 1:28:45.403
Stay in till dawn.

1:31:03.917 --> 1:31:08.672
<i>In 2009,</i> a <i>deadly virus
burned through our civilization...</i>

1:31:08.838 --> 1:31:12.092
<i>...pushing humankind

1:31:12.258 --> 1:31:15.220
<i>Dr. Robert Neville dedicated his life...</i>

1:31:15.470 --> 1:31:17.722
<i>...to the discovery of a cure...</i>

1:31:17.889 --> 1:31:20.642
