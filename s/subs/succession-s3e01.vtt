I think we have to cooperate.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.257
I mean, we were under
pressure already--

12:38.340 --> 12:39.842
Unless we don't?

12:39.925 --> 12:42.052
Yeah, but real world?

12:42.136 --> 12:44.263
I mean,
this is a public company.

12:44.346 --> 12:46.682
We don't know what they have
or what they might get.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.100
There's only one real play here.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.853
And what if I don't want to pull
down my panties down so fast?

12:50.936 --> 12:52.313
ROMAN: Then you pull up
the draw-bridge.

12:52.396 --> 12:55.024
It's politically motivated.
"Come get us, motherfuckers."

12:55.107 --> 12:56.317
What's our story?

12:56.400 --> 12:59.320
The story is--is that he's
exploiting these poor women.

12:59.403 --> 13:00.821
And that's very sad.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.573
You were grooming him
for the top.

13:02.656 --> 13:05.576
But you know?
He's a junkie and he blew it.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.661
He's a bitter fuck up
that needs psychiatric help.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.831
And of course
you're the big baddie,
so everybody jumped on board.

13:10.915 --> 13:12.124
And what about these papers?

13:12.208 --> 13:14.043
Uh, they're fake. Or stolen,

13:14.126 --> 13:16.670
if they even exist. Are you
worried about the papers?

13:16.754 --> 13:19.507
Hmm? We'll go after him
for corporate theft.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.884
This is, you know, not nice
thing to say about your son

13:21.967 --> 13:25.304
but maybe you chop him
into a million pieces
and toss him in the Hudson?

13:25.387 --> 13:27.264
You destroy Kendall,
it falls apart.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.391
LOGAN: What do we think?

13:30.392 --> 13:31.602
How's the price?

13:32.811 --> 13:35.856
Well, uh, net-net, it's steady.

13:35.940 --> 13:38.567
But institutions are dumping
in case this kills us

13:38.651 --> 13:41.028
and arbs are buying in case
Sandy and Stewy win.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.696
Yeah,
Kendall has changed the game.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.033
Noncooperation now, it's not--
it's too...

13:46.116 --> 13:48.410
It's too hot out there.
I think it's very high risk.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.538
Yeah, well, everything's
high risk if you're a pussy.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.498
-Hey, I eat red meat. Okay?
-ROMAN: Well...

13:52.581 --> 13:53.874
I'm just--the repercussions.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.793
ROMAN: Yeah, but I think
you're looking too small.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.503
We do a dance

13:57.586 --> 13:59.922
and we bide our time
'til the election.

14:00.005 --> 14:03.634
ATN anointy-nointy the Raisin
for a second term?

14:03.717 --> 14:06.095
New Attorney General.
And by then,

14:06.178 --> 14:07.388
this has gotten a little stale,

14:07.471 --> 14:10.015
Kendall will self-destruct
because it's his favorite.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.934
And this all fades
the fuck away.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.062
If I stop picking at scabs,

14:15.145 --> 14:17.773
saying, "Sorry,"
who knows where we'll end up.

14:17.856 --> 14:21.360
Class actions from the chancers
and opportunists.

14:21.443 --> 14:23.153
Admissions of wrongdoing...

14:24.238 --> 14:26.323
-Billions out of the door.
-Fuck!

14:26.407 --> 14:28.158
If you were to call the AG
right now and shout at him,

14:28.242 --> 14:30.661
-could we find out
if that'd be okay?
-Hugo, can you find out

14:30.744 --> 14:32.871
what would happen
if Logan called the AG?

14:32.955 --> 14:35.708
Get the Raisin.
Let's go to the top.

14:36.625 --> 14:38.252
Let's get the President.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.962
But gentle. Okay?

14:41.422 --> 14:42.464
Anything else?

14:43.340 --> 14:44.675
Do we want to order some food?

14:44.758 --> 14:47.553
Food? Swallow.
We're on saliva

14:47.636 --> 14:51.473
and adrenaline here,
until we get on a plane.
All right?

14:51.557 --> 14:52.975
No local foods.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.019
I get the shits, we're fucked.

14:55.102 --> 14:58.272
-Hugo! Let's go.
-Okay.

14:58.355 --> 14:59.940
LOGAN: We've lingered
long e-fucking-nough!

15:00.024 --> 15:03.736
HUGO: Okay, guys, uh,
this way please.
The plane's on the tarmac.

15:03.819 --> 15:06.822
-Let's get going.
I will definitely call you back.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.853
HUGO: The vans are here.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.067
So, the President
is basically supportive,

16:25.150 --> 16:26.485
but they think
it might be best for there

16:26.568 --> 16:29.655
not to be a call with you
on the White House log today.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.157
Like he can't make
a fucking private call?

16:32.241 --> 16:33.867
We got offered Michelle-Anne.

16:33.951 --> 16:35.577
Oh, the pantsuit barnacle?

16:36.370 --> 16:37.538
I got her if you wanna.

16:37.621 --> 16:40.165
No. Fuck it. No.
I don't talk to the babysitter.

16:40.249 --> 16:42.042

he needs a sandwich.

-A sandwich?
-Yeah. I tried to tell him.

17:09.570 --> 17:12.072
and we know the President
will be supportive,

17:12.156 --> 17:13.407
but we just wanted to answer--

want DOJ to follow Kendall off

17:32.718 --> 17:34.344

22:10.954 --> 22:14.124
-It's fine. Shut up.
-Hey. Look.

22:16.251 --> 22:18.378
I'm not sure
how much cover I've got.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.965
I need to talk to a lawyer
on my position.

22:22.674 --> 22:23.842
Who's a tough bastard?

22:23.925 --> 22:26.887
What? Like a kind of
Layo Upton type motherfucker?

22:26.970 --> 22:29.765
A woman would be great.
Like a Lisa Arthur?

22:29.848 --> 22:33.769
-She did the hookers, right?
-She repped
the trafficked sex workers, yes.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.228
It'd be great
to have her credibility.

22:35.312 --> 22:37.314
FRANK VERNON: Yeah. There are
three or four good women,

22:37.397 --> 22:40.025
but Lisa has an excellent brain.
She is a winner.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.985
GERRI: You go with Layo,
people will be like,

22:42.069 --> 22:44.863
"Oh, he's going scorched earth.
Maybe he can fight this."

22:44.946 --> 22:46.907
We get Lisa,
people will be like,

22:46.990 --> 22:48.742
"Gee, maybe this is bullshit."

22:48.825 --> 22:52.579
-Can I get her?
-TOM WAMBSGAN: Well, uh, Shiv...

22:52.662 --> 22:53.914
-Uh, yeah! I...
-TOM: Right?

22:53.997 --> 22:55.791
I mean, you know? I'm...

22:55.874 --> 22:58.543
She's--Yeah, she's a pretty--
She's a friend.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.629
-Could you get her for me?
-SHIV: I don't know. I mean,

23:00.712 --> 23:03.840
she fucking loves winning
and she loves money. So, uh...

23:03.924 --> 23:06.510
-Listen. Listen.
-I don't... know.

23:06.593 --> 23:08.178
Cooperate or not,

23:09.387 --> 23:10.847
to keep the board sweet,

23:12.140 --> 23:13.850
I may need to step back
a little.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.977
Okay. Oh, well then,
who would--

23:16.061 --> 23:19.689
I don't want to go back
right now. Does that play?

23:19.773 --> 23:23.985
Yeah, I mean, I just--
I, I want you safe.

23:24.069 --> 23:26.530
-That's the most
important thing.
-Yeah.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.950
Okay. Okay, okay, uh,

23:30.033 --> 23:32.786
Shiv, Roman, Gerri
are gonna go back

23:32.869 --> 23:34.454
to manage New York.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.581
No need for me
to go running back

23:36.665 --> 23:38.583
like a slapped girl, looks weak.

23:38.667 --> 23:41.336
-Great! Another plane.
-Want me to go?

23:41.419 --> 23:43.964
No, no, no. I don't trust you.

23:44.047 --> 23:47.884
You're gonna stay with me.
Karl can monitor board liaison.

23:47.968 --> 23:50.262
Tom here, across ATN.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.264
I'll make the call
on the lawyer.

23:52.347 --> 23:56.643
I like--I like Layo, but, uh,
I need to think about it.

23:56.726 --> 23:58.979
Council of war on the plane!

23:59.062 --> 24:02.732
Go on, fuck off back there,
Tumbledown Dick.

24:02.816 --> 24:06.111
Logan, uh, this plane has now
been rerouted to Sarajevo.

24:06.194 --> 24:09.030
It's ready to go. And, uh,
I will get another plane.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.825
(CLEARS THROAT) Uh, Logan?
Do you need...

24:11.908 --> 24:13.702
-Oh, Con?
-This guy? Yeah.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.371
-Con, yes, yes, yes.
Very important.

24:16.454 --> 24:20.292
Can you hold the fort here?
Can you keep this all secure?

24:20.375 --> 24:23.461
You mean hold down the Balkans
with just two divisions?

24:24.546 --> 24:25.881
I can try.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.136
HUGO: See you guys.
Have a good trip.

24:31.219 --> 24:33.263
-Thanks.
-WILLA: Mm-hmm.

24:33.346 --> 24:36.224
Oh, listen, my guy made contact
and they wanna know

24:36.308 --> 24:39.394
if we wanna do
a marketing push with the play.

24:39.477 --> 24:40.896
-Okay.
-You know?

24:40.979 --> 24:42.772
The whole hate watch angle,

24:42.856 --> 24:45.400
uh, you know, like, pick out
all the worst reviews

24:45.483 --> 24:47.194
like, you know, "Kill yourself
if you got a ticket,"

24:47.277 --> 24:48.486
or the one about brain poison.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.739
Yeah, okay, I know
all of them, Con. Thank you.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.866
-That's so sweet.
-Right. So, jump on
the irono-cycle

24:52.949 --> 24:54.993
and, uh, make it into a thing

24:55.076 --> 24:57.245
for the hipsters
and the dipshits.

24:57.329 --> 25:00.165
-WILLA FERREYRA: Oh.
-We could make
a nice little return.

25:00.248 --> 25:05.378
Mm-hmm. Sure. Yeah, I mean.
Yeah. That sounds exciting.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.880
CONNOR ROY: Yeah?

25:06.963 --> 25:10.091
Hey, so,
we'll talk about things...

25:10.175 --> 25:11.843
-when we get back, right?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

25:11.927 --> 25:15.555
-TOM: Yeah? Okay. Cool.
-Of course. Yeah, okay.
So, yeah.

25:15.639 --> 25:19.434
-You know, 'cause I love you.
-Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Thanks.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.228
Thank you.

25:21.311 --> 25:23.563
And, uh... Yeah, don't...

25:25.315 --> 25:26.441
You'll see him again.

25:27.901 --> 25:30.695
Well, yeah, obviously
I'll see him again, Tom.

25:30.779 --> 25:33.406
-Why would you say that?
-I'm being nice, Shiv.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.991
If you're worried
that he won't come home,

25:35.075 --> 25:37.535
I think that's unlikely.
Okay, so...

25:37.619 --> 25:38.912
Well, I know that.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.081
Okay. Great. It's fine.

25:41.164 --> 25:42.916
-SHIV: Okay.
-TOM: Okay.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.877
Oh, did Ken call you?

25:45.961 --> 25:48.964
Ken? Me? No.
No, no, no.

25:49.047 --> 25:50.882
Not to speak. No.
Why, did he call you?

25:50.966 --> 25:52.300
-No.
-TOM: No.

25:52.384 --> 25:53.843
No. No, I was just wondering.

25:55.679 --> 25:58.515
-Okay. Well, look after him.
-Okay.

25:58.598 --> 26:00.976
-Keep in touch.
-Okay. (BLOWS KISS)

26:01.059 --> 26:03.353

to be, yeah.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.034
So just buzz me in.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.419

-RAVA ROY: You're good?
-Yeah. Yeah.

26:51.109 --> 26:53.028
Is it okay if I bring
in the guys?

26:53.111 --> 26:54.821

-Yeah. They're legit,
right, Jess?
-GREG: Yeah.

-All the Emirati use the firm.
-JESS: Yeah, vetted. Totally.

26:58.658 --> 27:00.076
Oh, well, amazing.

to do a few calls?

Yeah, well,
it's been in the mail.

27:25.977 --> 27:27.687
It has been in the mail.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.981
You know, like you always said,
it was either this

27:30.065 --> 27:33.068
or, you know, go to Mount Athos
and become a monk.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.904
-Oh, yeah. This monastery
on Mount Athos.
-Mount Athos.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.448

a more logical choice.

28:07.977 --> 28:10.438
I've been up against it
at work but...

28:10.522 --> 28:12.899

you did great.
-KENDALL: Oh. Yeah.

28:12.982 --> 28:15.026
Yeah, it was...
it was fine, whatever.

Can I do this?
Can I win?

(IN SILLY VOICE)
Oh. Oh! You got me.

44:02.556 --> 44:05.434
Oh, you really fooled me, Shiv.
(MOCKING)

44:05.809 --> 44:06.894
Hilarious.

44:37.549 --> 44:40.636
LISA ARTHUR: We've gone
over that, so now,
what's the solution?

44:42.096 --> 44:44.056
Okay.
Well, when is that happening?

44:44.139 --> 44:46.100
-KEITH: Eminently.
-LISA: Okay, good.

44:47.267 --> 44:49.019
Can I have the room, please?

44:55.442 --> 44:57.277
-SHIV: Hey. (LAUGHS)
-LISA: Hey, Shiv.

44:57.361 --> 44:59.905
Lisa! How are you?

44:59.988 --> 45:01.407
-Good.
-God, look at you!

45:01.490 --> 45:03.367
-It's been so long. This place--
-Sit, sit.

45:03.450 --> 45:04.660
Wow, it's amazing.

45:05.285 --> 45:07.079
Thank you.

45:07.162 --> 45:11.333
So, um... So listen.
I'm just gonna jump right in

45:11.417 --> 45:13.877
because I don't want this
to be difficult with a friend.

45:13.961 --> 45:16.547
Um, and I hope I've not wasted
your time because...

45:16.630 --> 45:18.465
Yeah, no,
the message came through.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.467
-You can't act for my dad.
-Right.

45:21.301 --> 45:23.137
I don't think I fit, so...

45:23.679 --> 45:25.222
Yeah. Uh...

45:25.305 --> 45:27.891
So, cards on the table, I wanted
to talk to you

45:27.975 --> 45:32.646
-about something else.
-Oh. Okay.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.898
Mm-hmm. I'm, uh...

45:36.275 --> 45:38.569
Yeah, I'm thinking about
my own position here.

45:38.652 --> 45:41.947
And to be honest,
I could do with a friend.

45:42.030 --> 45:44.783
A discreet friend
with legal training.

45:44.867 --> 45:46.952
You know, a consigliere.

45:47.035 --> 45:50.414
A smart, savvy woman,
who can help me navigate

45:50.497 --> 45:52.124
the position I find myself in.

45:52.207 --> 45:55.377
Right, that's kind.

45:55.461 --> 45:57.671
But that's not the kind of role
I normally take on.

45:57.754 --> 45:59.173
I know, I know, but, uh,

45:59.256 --> 46:02.092
honestly, Lis, I got
nowhere to fucking turn here.

46:02.176 --> 46:04.011
You know my husband
is a player in this.

46:04.094 --> 46:05.804
And, uh, in one world,

46:05.888 --> 46:08.807
there's, uh, I'm in a position
to come out here as CEO.

46:08.891 --> 46:13.187
Or I might have to leave the
firm to protect my reputation.

46:13.270 --> 46:15.105
You know, I don't know
what my dad did,
and I don't know

46:15.189 --> 46:17.733
what my brother did,
and I don't know
what the firm did.

46:17.816 --> 46:21.236
I'm in a fucking
fuck pie here, Lisa.

46:21.320 --> 46:23.322
Can I clean it up?
I don't know.

46:23.405 --> 46:25.324
I don't know. I have a plan...

46:25.407 --> 46:27.993
but I could easily get crushed
between these two fucking men,

46:28.076 --> 46:30.537
and I need to game things out,
and I need to do that

46:30.621 --> 46:32.414
with someone
who can give me a read
legally and culturally

46:32.498 --> 46:34.541
-and politically and socially,
and, you know, it's a lot.
-Okay, look. Okay, look.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.877
-And I trust you and...
-Look, look, stop. Stop, Shiv.

46:38.629 --> 46:40.047
I can't give you legal advice

46:40.130 --> 46:42.633
and you should not give me
any confidential information.

46:42.716 --> 46:44.301
-Okay?
-Okay.

46:44.384 --> 46:46.637
Uh, fuck. Uh...

46:50.140 --> 46:51.767
I'm sorry. Is that--Does...

Does that mean
what I think it means?

46:55.646 --> 46:57.606
-Are we done?
-Yeah, you know what?

your wagon to, honey,

are going in the ditch.

Right. Thanks, "honey."

consider working with that

I'll let you know.

And it looks like
my dad's gone to Sarajevo.

52:43.410 --> 52:46.371
Okay. So, I should, um,
make it clear

52:46.454 --> 52:48.373
this is just a preliminary.

52:48.456 --> 52:49.833
So, no confidential information.

52:49.916 --> 52:52.419

what can I tell you?

52:52.502 --> 52:55.130
Uh... my dad's the devil.

52:55.213 --> 52:57.716
He runs a crime ring,
and I would love to hire you

52:57.799 --> 52:59.009
because you're a super star

52:59.092 --> 53:00.594
and I think you can take down
my dad,

53:00.677 --> 53:02.095
and this will be the case
of the century

53:02.178 --> 53:05.015
-and the highlight
of your career.
-Okay. Okay.

53:05.098 --> 53:06.766
-Well, that might be--
-KENDALL: I'm serious.

53:06.850 --> 53:08.393
They'll make a movie about you.

53:08.476 --> 53:09.686
We should make a movie
about you.

53:09.769 --> 53:11.146
Mm-hmm. And how would that look?

53:11.229 --> 53:13.773
It would look amazing,
because it would be brilliant!

53:13.857 --> 53:17.319
Okay, look, this is quite
a complex situation to progress

53:17.402 --> 53:19.905
because, as I understand it,
you want to take down your dad

53:19.988 --> 53:22.240
-without implicating yourself?
-Correct.

53:22.324 --> 53:23.950
And without damaging
the company to the extent

53:24.034 --> 53:27.120
that you lose control
at your shareholder meeting?

53:27.203 --> 53:31.833
-Correct.
-And you know that Shiv and I
have had a friend relationship?

53:31.917 --> 53:33.793
Yeah, well, that might
work out anyway.

53:33.877 --> 53:36.630
Okay, well, that's for you two,
but first things.

53:36.713 --> 53:39.132
Has the government reached out
to you yet?

53:39.215 --> 53:41.968
Or have you received a subpoena
for the documents yet?

53:42.052 --> 53:43.428
No, no. And look, to be clear,

53:43.511 --> 53:45.680
I will do whatever you tell me
to do.

53:46.514 --> 53:47.807
I am your puppet.

53:47.891 --> 53:49.809
LISA: Okay. Well, in the first
instance, we need to make sure

53:49.893 --> 53:52.938
you're in the clear
with your friends
at one, Saint Andrew's.

53:53.021 --> 53:54.606
-Right.

to make sure

you're my lawyer!

see that there was dust all over
the bottle?

54:12.582 --> 54:13.959
-We okay?
-RAVA: Did you not think to--

54:14.042 --> 54:16.670
-No, it's fine.
-I really had no--
I'm really sorry, Rava.

54:16.753 --> 54:19.589
-RAVA: It is fine.
-What?

54:19.673 --> 54:22.008
That was one
my godfather gave me.

54:22.092 --> 54:23.510
Naomi told me to open it, Ken.

54:23.593 --> 54:24.678
-Oh.
-And so I just...

54:24.761 --> 54:26.721
-Well, I'm very sorry, Rava.
-I'm so sorry.

54:26.805 --> 54:28.014
-RAVA: Greg, that's not...
-Hi.

54:28.098 --> 54:31.059
-Hey.
-Hey, ooh, sorry.

54:31.142 --> 54:33.478
No, no, no.
Guys, drink it, enjoy it.

54:33.561 --> 54:36.064
-GREG: I don't want any
personally--
-It's fine! It's good.

54:36.147 --> 54:38.650
It's like when someone breaks
something beautiful

54:38.733 --> 54:41.194
and it reminds you
that nothing lasts.

54:42.904 --> 54:43.905
Enjoy it.

54:45.824 --> 54:49.119
I'll get some napkins.

54:54.582 --> 54:56.918
All these brilliant
fucking women, Greg.

54:57.002 --> 54:59.295
-I mean...
-Hey, I must be doing
something right.

55:00.171 --> 55:01.631
-Right? Right?
-You are.

55:01.715 --> 55:03.299
You're doing everything right,
man.

55:03.383 --> 55:05.135
You are on top of the world.

55:05.218 --> 55:07.971
Okay. Uh, I'll be back
in a flash.

55:08.054 --> 55:11.766
All right, baby. Lisa Arthur,
you got my undivided attention.

55:11.850 --> 55:14.227
-LOGAN: Where's Shiv?
-I'm trying.

55:14.310 --> 55:16.771
Looks like the Gerri CEO
news might have leaked.

55:17.981 --> 55:21.484
-And I got Simon
on the board lined up.
-LOGAN: Uh-huh.

55:21.568 --> 55:24.320
-Do you want a room?
-Yes, I want a fucking room!

55:24.404 --> 55:26.614
I'm about to eat dick for three
hours straight,

55:26.698 --> 55:30.577
so, yes, Hugo,
I would like a fucking room.

55:30.660 --> 55:34.330
-(PHONE RINGING)
-HUGO: Okay...

55:34.414 --> 55:35.582
I don't need that.

55:38.752 --> 55:39.794
Kendall.

55:42.881 --> 55:43.882
Right.

55:46.843 --> 55:48.595
Sure, well, whatever.

55:52.015 --> 55:54.350
-What now?
-Nothing, tell you later.

55:54.434 --> 55:56.978
-Go on, fucking say!
-It's not a big deal.

55:58.563 --> 56:00.607
Lisa Arthur is going
to represent Kendall.

56:02.150 --> 56:03.193
Huh.

56:04.986 --> 56:05.987
Fine.

56:07.405 --> 56:08.406
Fine.

56:09.908 --> 56:10.950
Let's get Layo.

56:12.410 --> 56:14.079
We'll fucking beast 'em.

56:14.162 --> 56:18.124
We'll go full fucking beast!
