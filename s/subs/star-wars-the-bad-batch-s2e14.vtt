01:12.375 --> 01:14.416

-[pilot] We're under attack, sir.

-[alarm blaring]
-Get us out of here. Jump to hyperspace.

01:59.750 --> 02:01.541
They've taken out our hyperdrive.

02:01.625 --> 02:04.250
Then open fire and notify command.

02:07.916 --> 02:11.125

Well, that definitely got their attention.

02:11.208 --> 02:12.375
Let's make this quick.

02:25.125 --> 02:26.833
Fireball, prep the leech vessel.

02:27.541 --> 02:30.916
We need to board and recover those
prisoners before reinforcements show up.

02:36.916 --> 02:38.875
Why have you stopped firing?

02:38.958 --> 02:41.083
Shoot that ship down!

02:41.166 --> 02:42.833

05:20.791 --> 05:21.791
Get anything?

05:22.458 --> 05:25.416
They were erasing the data banks.
Not sure how much I can recover.

05:26.458 --> 05:30.666
Well, I guess we'll have to get
that intel out of you.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.208
[grunts]

05:39.500 --> 05:41.791
Got the prisoners. Fall back.

We have to go.

05:55.541 --> 05:57.000
I need more time.

Move out.

07:34.875 --> 07:37.583
Good morning, Crosshair.
How are you feeling?

07:37.666 --> 07:39.708
What's it to you?

07:43.166 --> 07:44.541
The doctor is on his way.

07:45.333 --> 07:47.166
Be smart and cooperate,

07:47.250 --> 07:49.708
or he will resort to methods
you will not enjoy.

07:55.291 --> 07:59.125
You've healed quickly,
considering the state you arrived in.

08:00.625 --> 08:02.791
Why am I here?

08:04.333 --> 08:07.916
If you think this is punishment
for shooting your commanding officer,

08:08.000 --> 08:09.000
you're incorrect.

08:09.625 --> 08:12.208
I actually think that shows
quite a bit of initiative.

08:15.208 --> 08:20.750
No. No, you are here because I intend
to give you a clean slate.

08:21.791 --> 08:28.625
And all you have to do in exchange
is tell me how to find Clone Force 99.

08:31.625 --> 08:35.041
They're in possession of something I need.

08:36.666 --> 08:38.208
The kid.

08:39.208 --> 08:40.833
[chuckles] Very good.

08:41.791 --> 08:43.916
You're wasting your time.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.875
They'll never turn her over.

08:46.666 --> 08:47.958
They don't have a choice.

08:48.041 --> 08:52.000
She is a clone
and, therefore, Imperial property.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.333
Help me locate your former squad,

08:56.958 --> 08:58.541
and you will have your freedom.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.958
I don't know where they are.

[grunts]

09:11.208 --> 09:13.083
[groans]

09:14.458 --> 09:18.750
But you know how they think,
how they operate,

09:18.833 --> 09:20.916
contacts they'd reach out to.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.750
Surely you have something useful to share.

09:26.583 --> 09:27.833
Wrong.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.250

09:50.166 --> 09:53.666

The prisoners aboard escaped.

Inform me when he's ready to talk.

10:02.333 --> 10:03.958
[Crosshair groans]

10:29.041 --> 10:31.250
I don't know how long
we were in that prison.

10:33.166 --> 10:36.833
I went in with eight of my men,
only three survived.

10:38.125 --> 10:40.208
All other prisoners were clones too.

10:43.125 --> 10:45.708
For what crime
were you all being detained?

10:46.416 --> 10:50.833
Dissidence. Questioning
and disobeying Imperial orders.

10:51.458 --> 10:54.458
They were being shuttled off-world
when we intercepted them.

10:54.541 --> 10:56.125
Where were you being taken?

10:56.208 --> 10:57.750
I don't know.

10:57.833 --> 11:01.666
But other groups of clones were
transferred before us, some rotations ago.

11:02.166 --> 11:05.250
And they… they never came back.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.375
We must find out
where that ship was headed.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.916
I recovered a portion of the data logs.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.000
It's heavily encrypted,
but I know someone who can crack it.

11:14.666 --> 11:18.041
Go. I'll take care of things here
and see what else I can find out.

11:18.125 --> 11:19.375
Thank you, Senator.

11:50.625 --> 11:54.000
Our orders were to not stop
until he talks.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.958
He can't talk if he's dead.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.375
You may secure his restraints.

-Not in your condition.

12:35.375 --> 12:38.333
Give me your access card.

12:38.416 --> 12:40.375
It won't get you outside.

12:40.458 --> 12:44.375
But even if you do manage that,
the hounds will find you within minutes.

This friend of yours who's stopping by,
he's another clone?

15:59.916 --> 16:03.458
Yeah, but don't worry.
He's not with the Empire.

16:03.541 --> 16:06.250
If you trust him, that's enough for me.

16:06.875 --> 16:09.458
The new fishing dock's rebuilt and moored.

16:28.166 --> 16:29.500
You all have.

16:29.583 --> 16:33.500
Any chance you've reconsidered
staying permanently?

16:34.625 --> 16:40.833
For soldiers, putting down roots
is an occupational hazard.

how the transport was targeted.

20:46.500 --> 20:50.916
simply decommissioning problematic clones
will not eliminate the threat.

20:51.916 --> 20:56.333
If you send them to me,
I can deal with them in other ways.

20:58.333 --> 21:01.583
<i>I will expect a full briefing</i>
<i>on your plan at the summit.</i>

21:20.583 --> 21:24.208
You all plan to stay here indefinitely?

21:25.791 --> 21:28.333
We haven't decided yet.

21:29.625 --> 21:31.458
-Here I come! [laughs]
-[Lyana screams, giggles]

21:31.541 --> 21:33.041
[Omega giggles] Too slow!

21:34.458 --> 21:40.208
But, to be honest,
it might be the best thing for us.

21:42.375 --> 21:45.500
What about you? What have you been up to?

21:46.458 --> 21:49.583
Rex and I have built up
a small network of clones.

21:50.250 --> 21:52.708
Some are in hiding, underground.

21:52.791 --> 21:56.083
Others act as our contacts
within the Empire.

21:56.583 --> 21:59.791
Echo, you've seen the power
you're up against.

22:00.291 --> 22:01.458
You can't defeat them.

22:02.125 --> 22:06.375
It's not about that.
It's about fighting for our brothers.

22:07.208 --> 22:12.041
I understand why you're doing this…
[sighs] …but when will it be enough?

22:12.125 --> 22:13.416
[comlink beeps]

22:13.500 --> 22:17.041
[Tech] <i>Hunter, I decrypted the data.</i>
<i>You need to get back to the ship.</i>

22:22.916 --> 22:24.166
[beeps]

22:25.250 --> 22:29.833
The Imperial transport Echo hijacked was
assigned to the Advanced Science Division.

22:30.375 --> 22:31.791
Never heard of it.

22:31.875 --> 22:34.791
That is because it is
a clandestine operation.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.833
There are no records on its location
or its purpose.

22:38.625 --> 22:41.916
All I could find on it
was the chief scientist in charge,

22:42.000 --> 22:43.416
Dr. Royce Hemlock.

22:43.500 --> 22:46.083
An officer expelled
from the Republic science corps

22:46.166 --> 22:50.291
due to his unauthorized
and unorthodox experiments.

22:51.333 --> 22:53.833
Why were they sending
clone prisoners to him?

22:54.916 --> 22:56.583
I do not know, but it gets worse.

22:57.333 --> 23:00.250
Previous transfer records recovered
from the ship's logs

23:00.333 --> 23:04.000
list other clone prisoners detained
by the Advanced Science Division.

23:04.500 --> 23:06.375
And Crosshair is one of them.

23:08.208 --> 23:11.875
You mean Crosshair turned on the Empire?

23:11.958 --> 23:13.916
How sure are you about this?

23:14.000 --> 23:15.125
Very.

23:15.208 --> 23:18.208
After discovering his clone number
on the transfer register,

23:18.291 --> 23:22.000
I checked our old comm channels
and found a recent distress message sent

23:22.083 --> 23:23.750
from Crosshair's old code.

23:23.833 --> 23:25.375
What did it say?

23:26.375 --> 23:29.041
Plan 88. The Seeker.

23:30.375 --> 23:31.833
We are being targeted.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.750
I believe he is warning us.

23:35.958 --> 23:39.708
Or it's a trap,
like he's set for us before.

23:40.708 --> 23:41.708
[Wrecker grunts]

23:42.958 --> 23:44.458
Well, how do we find out?

24:15.333 --> 24:18.666
If your escape attempt didn't clue you in,

24:18.750 --> 24:24.375
the only chance you have of leaving
this facility is if I allow it.

24:27.208 --> 24:29.541
Perhaps now you'd like
to reconsider my offer.

24:34.083 --> 24:35.541
Why suffer more?

24:36.916 --> 24:38.875
All I need is the young clone.

24:39.458 --> 24:41.291
She means nothing to you.

24:42.416 --> 24:46.458
Help me and you'll have your freedom.

24:56.750 --> 24:57.750
[sighs]

24:59.416 --> 25:01.375
Increase his injection level this time.

25:03.166 --> 25:05.666
Let's see how long until you break.

25:09.166 --> 25:11.208
[interrogator droid chatters, whirs]

25:13.750 --> 25:16.125
[whirring continues]

25:17.875 --> 25:20.916
[chatters]

25:21.000 --> 25:25.333
[grunting]

25:29.791 --> 25:31.791
[grunting continues]
