WEBVTT

00:41.250 --> 00:43.166
I could use some help up here!

00:43.166 --> 00:45.583
<i>Our comms are down.
I can't contact Hunter.</i>

00:45.583 --> 00:48.750
That's not the priority.
The ship sustained heavy damage.

00:48.750 --> 00:50.125
I can see that.

00:58.083 --> 00:59.541
Get the stabilizers online!

00:59.541 --> 01:00.875
That's what I'm trying to do.

01:05.416 --> 01:06.791
We have to land.

01:06.791 --> 01:09.125
A little hard to do
when nothing's working.

02:03.125 --> 02:05.583
This will take forever to repair.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.416
No. There's no time for that.

02:10.166 --> 02:13.500
We need to get the nav reader online
to extract the coordinates to Tantiss

02:13.500 --> 02:15.166
for when we go back.

02:15.166 --> 02:17.208
We're not going back.

02:17.208 --> 02:19.375
We left the other prisoners behind.

02:19.375 --> 02:22.875
And the Empire is going to be searching
for this ship and us.

02:27.291 --> 02:28.750
We have to move.

02:28.750 --> 02:32.416
I scanned a spaceport a few clicks east.
We'll start there.

03:01.875 --> 03:05.791
Omega managed to escape this facility
and flee the planet.

03:05.791 --> 03:08.541
Along with CT-9904.

03:09.250 --> 03:12.250
That is most surprising.

03:13.083 --> 03:14.083
Is it?

03:15.000 --> 03:18.750
I never understood your attachment
to the young clone,

03:18.750 --> 03:21.166
but now it's clear why
you kept her so close.

03:22.208 --> 03:27.458
Suspicious that all the samples you've
taken from Omega never yielded results,

03:28.291 --> 03:33.166
yet one tested by Emerie
indicated a positive M-count transfer.

03:33.750 --> 03:37.083
False positives are to be expected.

03:37.833 --> 03:43.708
That result is nothing but an aberration,
like the clone herself.

03:44.500 --> 03:45.583
We shall see.

03:46.541 --> 03:50.708
Once Omega's brought back,
the test's validity will be confirmed.

03:51.833 --> 03:55.166
Your future, however, is less certain.

04:34.666 --> 04:37.083
Empire couldn't have followed us here
that quickly.

04:37.083 --> 04:38.750
They didn't.

04:38.750 --> 04:41.208
That's a standard patrol presence.

04:41.208 --> 04:42.291
Okay.

04:42.291 --> 04:45.416
So, let's find a way to send a message
to Hunter and Wrecker.

04:45.416 --> 04:46.750
We can't.

04:47.375 --> 04:50.708
They monitor long-range comms.
It'll give us away.

04:53.333 --> 04:55.250
We'll have to figure out something else.

04:55.791 --> 04:56.791
Wait.

04:56.791 --> 04:59.291
We can't walk around like this.

04:59.291 --> 05:00.875
We'll draw too much attention.

05:01.541 --> 05:04.458
You're the one who wanted
to bring the hound.

05:06.541 --> 05:09.541
Don't listen to him. Come on.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.583
See? Isn't this better?

05:35.583 --> 05:36.791
No.

05:50.708 --> 05:51.708
New plan.

05:51.708 --> 05:53.791
Let's get to the spaceport.

05:53.791 --> 05:55.791
We can sneak onto one of those shuttles.

06:23.541 --> 06:24.750
It's too well-guarded.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.666
We'll never slip past
all those troopers undetected.

06:27.666 --> 06:31.583
I can take out at least half
before they know what's happening.

06:31.583 --> 06:32.833
Or...

06:32.833 --> 06:37.541
Or we could try a way
that doesn't involve blaster fire.

06:37.541 --> 06:39.208
Like what?

06:42.458 --> 06:43.708
Watch and learn.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.750
I can hardly wait.

06:50.708 --> 06:51.708
Hello.

06:51.708 --> 06:54.291
We'd like two tickets on the next shuttle, please.

06:55.041 --> 06:56.625
Chain codes?

06:58.375 --> 07:02.250
About that. We lost our chain codes.

07:02.791 --> 07:04.541
No chain codes, no passage.

07:05.625 --> 07:06.791
Right.

07:07.416 --> 07:08.708
But you see,

07:08.708 --> 07:14.500
a problem for us
could be an opportunity for you

07:14.500 --> 07:18.333
if, say, you knew of an alternate way

07:18.333 --> 07:21.625
of booking passage without a chain code?

07:24.291 --> 07:30.708
Are you insinuating
that I should take a bribe?

07:31.375 --> 07:33.791
If that's what you want to call it.

07:37.125 --> 07:38.208
I do.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.083
And that could be arranged...

07:42.833 --> 07:44.666
for 15,000 credits.

07:44.666 --> 07:45.875
For two tickets?

07:45.875 --> 07:48.791
Per ticket. And it's nonnegotiable.

07:48.791 --> 07:51.708
You're lucky I'm not charging extra
for the creature.

07:52.833 --> 07:55.750
Where do you expect us
to get 30,000 credits?

07:56.416 --> 07:59.166
Sounds like a you problem.

07:59.166 --> 08:01.250
Don't come back without the credits.

08:06.666 --> 08:08.416
Well, that went well.

08:08.416 --> 08:09.500
Stow it.

08:11.500 --> 08:16.083
Cachu-Cachu! Half price!

08:19.125 --> 08:24.458
Storming the spaceport would
be easier than finding 30,000 credits.

08:24.458 --> 08:26.541
I don't want to hurt anyone.

08:27.166 --> 08:29.458
Don't be naive.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.791
Every second we're here, we're at risk.

08:31.791 --> 08:34.708
Then quit wasting time complaining.

08:41.958 --> 08:44.208
I think I know how
we can make some fast credits.

08:45.583 --> 08:46.916
Of course you do.

09:04.166 --> 09:07.875
That's your plan?
You want to hustle someone?

09:07.875 --> 09:09.541
I've done it before,

09:09.541 --> 09:14.458
and I prefer to think of it
as a temporary requisition of funds.

09:14.458 --> 09:17.416
And bet with what?
We don't have anything.

09:17.416 --> 09:19.333
They don't know that.

09:19.333 --> 09:22.083
I'll take those credits.

09:24.208 --> 09:26.208
And if you lose?

09:26.833 --> 09:29.166
Well...
...I guess we'll be in more trouble.

09:33.416 --> 09:36.166
All right, all right. Who's next?

09:36.916 --> 09:38.125
I'll give it a try.

09:39.666 --> 09:43.166
This shouldn't take long.

09:53.791 --> 09:55.458
I'm getting crushed here.

09:58.041 --> 09:59.750
How 'bout one more game?

09:59.750 --> 10:01.833
My luck has to run out eventually.

10:01.833 --> 10:03.708
Eh, that's true.

10:03.708 --> 10:05.375
But I get to deal this time.

10:28.166 --> 10:29.666
Your usual, Captain?

10:33.916 --> 10:36.125
Business looks good today.

10:36.625 --> 10:39.041
A newcomer has pulled in quite the crowd.

10:42.208 --> 10:44.875
Then business should be good for me today.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.041
Affirmative.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.625
Not again!

10:51.666 --> 10:54.083
Okay, okay. One more game.

10:54.083 --> 10:56.041
I think I'll quit while I'm ahead.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.125
Leaving so soon?

11:01.208 --> 11:02.291
You're in my seat.

11:11.208 --> 11:13.875
So, you think you're good at this game?

11:15.625 --> 11:18.958
Want to try against a, uh, real opponent?

11:22.125 --> 11:23.208
I insist.

11:30.916 --> 11:32.750
That shuttle looks like one of ours.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.083
Yeah, we better check it out.

11:49.833 --> 11:51.916
Your mutt don't seem to like me.

11:52.500 --> 11:53.375
She's harmless.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.625
She's a distraction. Get rid of her.

12:07.250 --> 12:10.541
Never seen you or your dad around before.

12:11.458 --> 12:12.791
We're just passing through.

12:17.250 --> 12:20.416
Looks like the captain
is heading towards a victory.

12:20.416 --> 12:22.750
Eh, I'll admit, you're not bad.

12:22.750 --> 12:26.083
But you seem to have misunderstood
your enemy.

12:28.500 --> 12:29.833
Did I?

12:34.208 --> 12:37.833
The three Eastern Stars.
That is game over.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.625
I'll take those 20,000 credits.

12:47.375 --> 12:51.625
I concede. You beat me fair and square.

12:53.291 --> 12:54.291
Nicely played.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.041
Thanks.

13:03.541 --> 13:07.458
Sir. Patrol found a crashed
Imperial vessel on the outskirts of town.

13:08.083 --> 13:10.916
I wasn't notified about any shuttles
arriving today.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.875
Now, hang on a minute.

13:16.583 --> 13:18.666
We're not done here.

13:22.041 --> 13:24.291
You haven't paid your fine.

13:24.958 --> 13:25.958
What fine?

13:27.166 --> 13:29.166
Gambling's illegal in these parts.

13:29.708 --> 13:30.708
What?

13:31.583 --> 13:32.833
The law is the law.

13:33.708 --> 13:37.791
Now, all you gotta do is pay the fine.
And I'll be on my way.

13:38.458 --> 13:39.458
How much?

13:40.291 --> 13:41.291
Ten thousand credits.

13:42.750 --> 13:45.833
Unless you prefer to be arrested instead.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.750
Excellent.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.791
Consider your fine paid in full.

13:57.791 --> 13:59.208
Try and stay out of trouble.

14:08.541 --> 14:10.416
Let's get out of here.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.416
How many credits do we have left?

14:14.416 --> 14:15.916
Thirty-five thousand.

14:15.916 --> 14:18.583
Enough for two tickets on the shuttle
and a little extra.

14:36.750 --> 14:38.750
Crosshair, where's Batcher?

14:41.125 --> 14:43.833
Oy. You looking for that hound?

14:43.833 --> 14:44.916
You know where she went?

14:44.916 --> 14:48.166
Sure do, but the answer's gonna cost you.

14:48.875 --> 14:51.291
Ten thousand credits.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.541
I'm getting tired of this.

14:53.541 --> 14:55.625
Okay, okay.

14:55.625 --> 14:58.458
Five, but that's my final offer.

15:07.916 --> 15:11.083
That Imperial officer and his troopers
snatched the creature

15:11.083 --> 15:14.125
and headed for the cargo docks.
Down that way.

15:15.250 --> 15:16.583
Nice doing business with ya.

15:23.250 --> 15:24.250
Omega.

15:25.583 --> 15:27.875
You heard him. Batcher's this way.

15:27.875 --> 15:30.916
And the spaceport is that way.

15:30.916 --> 15:33.791
Forget the hound.
We have to get off this planet.

15:33.791 --> 15:36.958
We never would've escaped without Batcher.

15:36.958 --> 15:38.166
I'm not leaving her.

15:38.166 --> 15:39.833
You're making a mistake.

15:40.791 --> 15:42.958
I'm not abandoning her!

15:43.791 --> 15:45.291
Take the credits.

15:45.291 --> 15:46.916
If you wanna go, then go.

15:48.083 --> 15:49.333
I'll find my own way.

16:47.500 --> 16:48.625
Fine.

16:50.250 --> 16:51.666
We'll do this your way.

16:52.958 --> 16:55.541
But my skills are being wasted.

16:56.666 --> 16:57.666
Noted.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.583
There's Batcher.

17:50.250 --> 17:52.000
Shouldn't we free the other animals too?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.250
Don't push it.

18:06.833 --> 18:09.375
I thought you'd come
searching for your mutt.

18:09.375 --> 18:14.750
Yeah, unfortunately for you,
Lau has a very strict pet policy.

18:19.375 --> 18:22.625
No license means a hefty fine.

18:23.416 --> 18:25.000
How much this time?

18:25.875 --> 18:28.250
How 'bout you give me all my money back?

18:28.250 --> 18:32.541
Credits won't do you any good
when Hemlock shows up.

18:34.291 --> 18:37.625
Did you think I wouldn't piece it together
when I found that crashed shuttle?

18:38.208 --> 18:40.416
Nothing gets by me.

18:41.166 --> 18:43.916
I run this town.

18:44.583 --> 18:48.500
So, hand over the credits and surrender.

18:53.291 --> 18:55.375
All right.

19:00.625 --> 19:03.416
Let's try things your way.

19:03.416 --> 19:05.166
Finally.

19:21.208 --> 19:23.416
Send reinforcements to the cargo dock!

19:33.041 --> 19:35.958
I'll handle this.
Take Batcher, and power up the ship.

19:56.708 --> 19:59.125
They're stealing the cargo ship!

20:24.333 --> 20:25.875
Let's--
Get out of here?

20:25.875 --> 20:27.041
Yeah. I'm on it.

20:27.041 --> 20:29.791
I hope your takeoffs
are better than your landings.

20:29.791 --> 20:31.125
We're about to find out.

21:08.708 --> 21:10.375
Sir, we have confirmation.

21:10.375 --> 21:14.000
The girl and CT-9904
were in the spaceport.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.000
Were?

21:15.000 --> 21:16.833
They escaped aboard a cargo freighter.

21:17.583 --> 21:20.833
Track the ship,
and notify all our operatives.

21:21.750 --> 21:23.333
I want her found.

21:33.333 --> 21:35.750
The Empire will be able
to track this vessel.

21:36.583 --> 21:37.833
We need to ditch it.

21:37.833 --> 21:38.916
We will.

21:38.916 --> 21:40.750
I'm heading to a remote location,

21:40.750 --> 21:44.208
and I sent a coded transmission
for Hunter and Wrecker to meet us there.

21:50.916 --> 21:51.916
Omega.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.666
It's-- It's been months.

21:55.666 --> 21:58.166
- You don't know if they're still aliv--
- They'll be there.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.375
Now, there's a sight!

22:58.375 --> 22:59.500
Wrecker!

22:59.500 --> 23:00.708
Ha!

23:04.125 --> 23:06.541
I wasn't even sure your message was real.

23:08.625 --> 23:09.666
Wrecker.

23:11.750 --> 23:13.416
I knew you'd show up.

23:16.791 --> 23:20.125
We crossed the galaxy four times
looking for you.

23:21.625 --> 23:22.625
Five.

23:26.000 --> 23:28.500
But you're the one who found us.

23:40.541 --> 23:41.625
We missed you, kid.

23:43.375 --> 23:45.041
We never stopped searching.

23:53.750 --> 23:57.375
But how did you escape?

23:58.708 --> 23:59.708
I had help.
