Please let me go home.
Please, I'm not who you think I am.

00:54.846 --> 00:57.087
I'm really not who you think I am.

00:57.975 --> 01:00.057
Please. Please. 
I'm not a spy.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.763
- You are a spy.
- I'm not a spy.

01:01.979 --> 01:05.062
- Please let me go home.
- Try again.

01:05.232 --> 01:06.938
I am not a spy.
I am a businesswoman.

01:07.109 --> 01:10.067
I work for Rink Petroleum and Gas.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.649
Please call them.
I work for Rink Petroleum.

01:12.823 --> 01:16.907
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambitions. Yes?

01:17.077 --> 01:19.989
I am not a spy! 
I am not a spy!

01:41.310 --> 01:44.097
- Try again.
- I am not a spy.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.681
- You are a spy.
- I am not a spy.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.187
Don't lie to me!

01:53.739 --> 01:58.324
I am not a spy.

01:59.369 --> 02:05.035
<i>It is through the grace and munificence 
of our glorious Dear Leader</i>

02:05.667 --> 02:08.830
<i>that the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea</i>

02:09.003 --> 02:12.588
<i>has pardoned the American imperialist</i>

02:12.758 --> 02:16.842
<i>for her hostile acts
against our socialist nation.</i>

02:17.012 --> 02:20.550
Keep your head down. Don't say
anything till we make the swap.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.342
In case Kim Jong II here
changes his mind.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.319
Exchange.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.571
Right face!

02:45.957 --> 02:47.913
Right face!

02:48.251 --> 02:50.537
I don't understand.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.953
You don't understand what?

02:55.008 --> 02:57.624
All the rules say to leave me,
that one life

02:57.803 --> 03:00.545
is not worth blowing operational cover.

03:00.722 --> 03:01.928
You got that right.

03:02.391 --> 03:06.100
If we have to lose someone
for the greater good, we will.

03:06.269 --> 03:07.304
So why did you do it?

03:08.522 --> 03:11.309
Well, I didn't do it.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.062
He did.

03:15.404 --> 03:18.271
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

03:20.409 --> 03:23.025
He petitioned the Senate,
the State Department.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.240
We didn't need the publicity
so I figured we better do something

03:26.415 --> 03:29.953
or he's gonna invade this goddamn
rice-paddy republic himself.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.508
You okay?

03:50.605 --> 03:52.095
Yeah.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.895
Hey.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.858
- Good morning.
- Happy anniversary.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.073
You want me to make you breakfast?

04:46.244 --> 04:48.656
How about pancakes?

04:48.830 --> 04:50.786
Your cooking?

04:51.082 --> 04:52.947
You're joking. 
You like my cooking.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.117
Germans don't joke.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.245
Burt likes my cooking.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.341
Get your bugs off the table.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.598
- They're spiders.
- They're bugs.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.638
- They're spiders.
- They're bugs.

05:17.526 --> 05:21.610
<i>Fold the next layer back
as you did the two before it.</i>

05:21.780 --> 05:25.364
<i>Turn the napkin over.
Fold both sides back,</i>

05:25.534 --> 05:28.367
<i>and over one another
about a third of the way.</i>

05:30.038 --> 05:33.872
<i>Check for symmetry
and press the fold down well.</i>

05:34.042 --> 05:36.158
Are you doing this on company time?

05:36.336 --> 05:39.999
- <i>And insert your favorite silverware...</i>
- It's my anniversary.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.507
And I want it to be perfect.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.885
But that is not sexy.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.758
No, but it is utilitarian.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.094
And utilitarian is the new sexy.

05:52.853 --> 05:55.845
I ran the trace. 
First name Usam, last name Utsaev.

05:56.022 --> 05:57.512
- Any verifiable hits?
- One.

05:57.691 --> 06:01.024
Hey, Francis, do me a favor 
and stick that in the safe till tomorrow.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.276
Mata Hari here's got a big night tonight.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.653
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

06:05.866 --> 06:08.778
"Sir"? 
Do I look like a "sir" to you?

06:08.952 --> 06:09.987
From head to toe.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.286
I'm surprised he didn't call you
"Your Majesty."

06:13.456 --> 06:17.620
I like the ring of that.
I think I'd prefer "Your Majesty."

06:18.670 --> 06:20.501
Was I ever that young?

06:22.883 --> 06:23.963
Younger.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.465
Walk me out.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.465
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

06:29.639 --> 06:31.470
Oh, you know. The usual.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.053
President wants to know
what's happening in Russia

06:34.227 --> 06:38.186
the day before it happens. How about you? 
I heard that interview went well.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.062
Fingers crossed.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.474
You sure about this?

06:42.652 --> 06:45.610
You know, once you start pushing paper, 
there's no turning back.

06:45.780 --> 06:49.147
I had the strangest feeling
when I was out last time.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.783
- I was homesick.
- Homesick?

06:51.953 --> 06:54.285
- Can't you take something for that?
- Sir! Sir!

06:56.499 --> 06:59.036
We got a walk-in.
A defector, 10 minutes ago.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.542
- Here?
- I guess he's not buying our cover.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.704
- Did you get his bona fides?
- He's Russian.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.998
He says he's FSB
but won't give us any more.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.382
- He's a strange guy.
- How's his English?

07:08.970 --> 07:10.676
Passable. Not great.

07:10.847 --> 07:13.714
But if it got down to
the subtleties of English nuance...

07:13.892 --> 07:17.510
- Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me at home.
- Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.722
Come on, Salt.

07:18.897 --> 07:22.060
No one can sort out a nut job
from the real thing faster than you.

07:22.233 --> 07:25.270
- I got 25 minutes.
- I got 26. Let's go.

07:31.201 --> 07:34.284
Yeah, okay. Well, we'll decide
when we know more.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.694
- Who called Counterintelligence?
- Not me.

07:36.873 --> 07:39.489
Hey, Ted.
We're crashing the party.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.493
- Peabody.
- Salt.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.466
Please remove the hood.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.173
Microphones are on.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.304
Checking levels.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.011
Baseline recorded.

08:02.440 --> 08:05.227
Neural scan is up. Ready to go.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.482
- Ev.
- Mm. Yeah.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.817
Commencing audio and visual recording.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.952
<i>Testing earpiece.</i>

08:24.462 --> 08:27.499
Interview has commenced at 1442.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.306
You're married.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.846
A husband must be a distraction

08:44.566 --> 08:47.649
for a female intelligence officer.

08:47.819 --> 08:49.980
Well, we're here to talk about you.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.311
So, what is your name?

08:53.074 --> 08:54.860
My name is

08:55.035 --> 08:59.404
Oleg Vassilyevich Orlov.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.825
I have cancer.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.039
I'm moved.

09:07.338 --> 09:09.329
A defector with cancer.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.542
Are you selling secrets for chemo
or are you afraid of dying?

09:13.720 --> 09:18.384
If I have gained anything
by damning myself,

09:18.808 --> 09:24.644
it is that I no longer
have anything to fear.

09:25.607 --> 09:28.269
<i>Russia is also dying.</i> 

09:28.443 --> 09:31.856
- <i>But unlike me, she's not dead.</i>
- Oleg Vassily Orlov,

09:32.030 --> 09:35.739
shows up in 1993
in Novosibirsk Oblast, Siberia.

09:35.950 --> 09:38.191
He was on Victor Barisovsky's
staff there.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.651
<i>He checks out as FSB, Ev.</i>

09:39.829 --> 09:42.696
Scan says he's truthful on the cancer.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.289
Prior to '93?

09:44.542 --> 09:46.578
<i>Russia was once strong, powerful...</i>

09:46.753 --> 09:49.244
Nothing.
He doesn't exist.

09:49.422 --> 09:53.165
<i>And she will be again
when things have been set back</i>

09:53.384 --> 09:55.340
<i>on the correct path.</i>

09:55.595 --> 09:58.302
I have somewhere I need to be, Mr. Orlov,

09:58.473 --> 10:01.055
so if you wouldn't mind
getting to the point.

10:04.229 --> 10:07.437
I came here to tell you a story.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.144
I don't like stories.

10:10.568 --> 10:13.105
But I'll listen anyway.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.190
In English, please.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.155
<i>Others are listening.</i>

10:18.118 --> 10:21.076
1975.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.779
The Cold War.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.365
<i>In a gymnasium in Grozny,</i>

10:27.544 --> 10:29.785
<i>a Soviet Olympic wrestler</i>

10:29.963 --> 10:33.501
<i>named Sasha Fyorodovich Chenkov</i>

10:34.134 --> 10:35.590
<i>meets for the first time</i>

10:36.177 --> 10:40.090
<i>the only female chess grand master
of her era;</i>

10:41.516 --> 10:44.974
<i>Anka Nurekyova.</i>

10:45.270 --> 10:48.353
<i>Within a month, they were married.</i>

10:48.523 --> 10:51.981
<i>And within a year, a child.</i>

10:52.569 --> 10:54.560
<i>One month more,</i>

10:54.737 --> 10:58.776
the child was back
in the same hospital,

10:58.950 --> 11:00.315
sick with fever.

11:02.954 --> 11:05.240
<i>And within days after that,</i>

11:05.415 --> 11:08.999
<i>the child suddenly was dead.</i>

11:11.171 --> 11:15.039
<i>Yes, a child was dead.</i>

11:15.216 --> 11:19.425
<i>And, yes, a child was buried.</i>

11:26.060 --> 11:30.178
<i>But the Chenkov baby was alive</i>

11:30.356 --> 11:34.725
<i>and became the property of another man.</i>

11:35.153 --> 11:39.271
<i>A master spy who had devised 
the greatest plan</i>

11:39.449 --> 11:43.783
<i>a Russian patriot could ever invent.</i>

11:43.953 --> 11:48.287
<i>A plan to destroy America.</i>

11:49.083 --> 11:50.914
<i>It had all started</i>

11:51.085 --> 11:55.044
with an American named
Lee Harvey Oswald.

11:55.215 --> 11:59.333
<i>In 1959, he emigrated to Russia.</i>

11:59.510 --> 12:02.422
<i>Three years later, he returned home.</i>

12:02.597 --> 12:05.384
<i>But the man who came back to America</i>

12:05.558 --> 12:11.019
<i>was in fact a Russian spy named Alek.</i>

12:11.397 --> 12:14.935
<i>On November 22nd, 1963,</i>

12:15.109 --> 12:19.648
<i>Alek became the first success
of the new program</i>

12:19.822 --> 12:23.314
<i>and a hero of the Soviet Union.</i>

12:23.701 --> 12:26.613
<i>The spymaster was now given the go-ahead</i>

12:26.788 --> 12:29.621
<i>to create many more like Alek.</i>

12:29.791 --> 12:33.249
<i>Scores of agents, males and females,</i>

12:33.419 --> 12:36.035
<i>to be substituted for Americans.</i>

12:36.214 --> 12:39.877
<i>I pledge allegiance to the flag...</i>

12:40.134 --> 12:42.170
<i>At an abandoned monastery,</i>

12:42.345 --> 12:46.133
<i>Chenkov and other boys and girls
learned English</i>

12:46.307 --> 12:48.844
<i>long before they learned Russian.</i>

12:49.018 --> 12:51.134
Drilled in idiom,

12:51.312 --> 12:53.519
<i>idiosyncrasy and</i>

12:54.691 --> 12:55.851
ideology.

12:57.360 --> 13:02.229
<i>And by methods of rigorous physical
and psychological programming,</i>

13:02.407 --> 13:05.490
the spymaster made warriors of iron.

13:05.660 --> 13:09.027
<i>Unquestioning and unbreakable.</i>

13:09.998 --> 13:11.408
Who crossed first?

13:12.166 --> 13:13.372
Who crossed last?

13:20.216 --> 13:22.502
You're killing me, man.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.876
When does the good fairy come in?

13:25.346 --> 13:27.007
Never.

13:27.181 --> 13:28.887
It's a story without hope.

13:29.392 --> 13:34.056
Chenkov was matched with the child
of a visiting American family.

13:34.230 --> 13:37.814
There was an accident.
The family died.

13:37.984 --> 13:40.896
Chenkov was sent to America

13:41.070 --> 13:44.483
to live a complete lie

13:44.657 --> 13:48.525
and to patiently await the day
to attack from within.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.739
Day X.

13:50.997 --> 13:55.411
The long-awaited mission is here.

13:56.085 --> 13:59.077
Chenkov will travel to New York City

13:59.255 --> 14:03.373
to kill the president of Russia

14:04.302 --> 14:09.137
at the funeral of
the American vice president.

14:10.308 --> 14:14.768
Chenkov is KA 12.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.595
- "KA."
- Cold War legend.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.605
Highly trained Russian sleeper agents

14:19.776 --> 14:23.644
inserted into American society
to sabotage and assassinate.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.779
Supposedly they'd wait years to strike. 
Decades, even.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.816
Mm. Supposedly.

14:29.994 --> 14:33.031
- What's the matter Ted? You don't believe in moles?
- I believe in moles, all right.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.537
Just not the bogeyman.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.665
Especially if the plan is
to kill their own president.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.746
This guy's selling smoke.

14:39.921 --> 14:41.832
Wrap it up, Ev.

14:42.632 --> 14:47.296
<i>So a Russian agent is going to kill
the Russian president? Is that it?</i>

14:47.845 --> 14:50.006
Mm-hm. Okay.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.422
Thank you very much.

14:52.600 --> 14:56.184
And what would you like
in return for that information?

14:56.354 --> 14:59.061
I simply wish to help you do

14:59.232 --> 15:01.644
what you need to do.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.109
You're good.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.990
The KA program is brilliant bullshit.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.194
But I'm officially off duty,

15:14.580 --> 15:17.993
so you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.249
- Salt.
- Yes?

15:20.753 --> 15:24.746
The name of the Russian agent is Salt.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.374
Evelyn Salt.

15:30.805 --> 15:32.716
My name is Evelyn Salt.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.015
Then you are a Russian spy.

15:37.562 --> 15:38.768
<i>Truthful.</i>

15:39.230 --> 15:44.725
So far the FMRI scan registers truthful
on everything he’s said.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.612
Ted?

15:55.246 --> 15:57.908
Call Protective Services,
make sure they find my husband.

15:58.082 --> 16:00.744
- I need to get to the phone.
- Not after the neural scan.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.705
I can beat that thing
five times out of six.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.836
I am trained to, and so is he.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.631
I need my phone.
I need to call my husband.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.376
- Let me call my husband.
- Let me see it.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.973
There's a reason he mentioned
my wedding ring, Ted.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.930
They don't just blow up their cover

16:20.104 --> 16:22.595
they blow up their whole cover life.
You know that.

16:22.773 --> 16:25.389
- Do you remember Henley's wife?
- Yes, I do.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.058
Speaker.

16:27.987 --> 16:31.024
<i>Please leave a message after the tone. 
Thanks. Bye.</i>

16:31.199 --> 16:33.906
Honey, it's me. Please call me
as soon as you get this.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.112
Okay, sweetheart?
As soon as you get this.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.619
Godspeed, Comrade Chenkov.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.783
Someone interrogate that piece of shit.
Someone who enjoys getting answers.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.456
Look, Ev, try to stay calm.

16:46.631 --> 16:50.419
- I'm not a goddamn Russian spy.
- I didn't say you were.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.709
Let's go up to my office,
we can sort this out.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.970
No, no. We gotta go 
to a secure location. Now.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.425
All right.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.299
Doesn't get any more secure than this.

17:00.603 --> 17:03.640
Ev? Five minutes.

17:04.732 --> 17:05.474
Call Protective Services

17:05.732 --> 17:08.474
- and tell them to find Mike.
- I will.

17:08.653 --> 17:10.814
This is bullshit.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.648
Give us a sec, we'll be right in.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.278
I know we're heading into your jurisdiction.

17:20.455 --> 17:22.242
- I'm just asking for five minutes.
- No.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.207
If I have to. You can't have five minutes. 
I have to talk to her.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.797
- She's scared. Don't you see that?
- I don't care.

17:34.971 --> 17:38.338
There is a mole in Russia house, Ted. 
There is a mole. I am sure.

17:51.362 --> 17:53.398
Please step in the elevator.

18:18.681 --> 18:22.048
<i>Russian president, okay? 
So I'm gonna ask you to step out of my way.</i> 

18:28.482 --> 18:30.393
What the hell is that?

18:30.860 --> 18:32.020
Sir.

19:15.071 --> 19:16.857
I gotta pee.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.981
<i>Where do you think he went?</i>

19:20.159 --> 19:23.196
<i>No one saw him coming out the front.</i>

19:23.579 --> 19:25.865
- Jesus Christ.
- Here he is again.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.865
No sign of him so far on the street.

19:29.043 --> 19:30.829
It's two minutes ago, before lockdown.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.619
- Anything clean on him?
- We just got a match, sir.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.504
It's May Day, 1981.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.882
There's Brezhnev. And there...

19:38.052 --> 19:39.167
- Orlov.
- That's him.

19:39.345 --> 19:42.212
He used to be a heavyweight
once upon a time.

19:42.515 --> 19:44.471
Get that photo out.
Every ticket counter,

19:44.642 --> 19:47.679
airport, train station, taxi dispatcher, 
the whole nine yards.

19:47.853 --> 19:51.016
- Get me Medford on a secure line.
- Yes, sir.

19:52.149 --> 19:54.891
- Top-right screen. Is that live?
- Yes, sir.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.400
Where is she going? Track her.

19:58.406 --> 20:01.068
<i>No one may leave the building.</i>

20:01.575 --> 20:03.486
Rink Petroleum, Security.

20:03.661 --> 20:06.573
Yes, you have a woman to your left,
behind you. Evelyn Salt.

20:09.250 --> 20:12.242
- We lost the visual on her.
- Damn it. Where'd she go?

20:12.420 --> 20:14.251
<i>We are on security lockdown.</i>

20:15.256 --> 20:17.247
Dave? It’s Evelyn, is Mike there?

20:17.466 --> 20:19.923
<i>No, I'm sorry. 
He left after lunch.</i>

20:20.094 --> 20:21.504
<i>Hey, happy anniversary, huh?</i>

20:21.679 --> 20:23.340
The stairwell.

20:23.764 --> 20:26.050
- Second floor.
- What's on that floor?

20:26.225 --> 20:28.887
- It's empty, a security buffer.
- Isolate and seal it.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.358
Get her records to my handheld.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.237
East corridor.

20:48.289 --> 20:49.950
<i>Notifying Metropolitan Police.</i>

20:58.716 --> 21:00.547
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

21:05.931 --> 21:07.011
We got her.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.514
<i>Locking down all floors.</i>

21:09.810 --> 21:12.096
<i>Security Protective Service
responding to threat.</i>

21:14.899 --> 21:18.357
All right. Get a tactical team
to meet me on the south stairwell.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.688
- Yes, sir.
- Director Medford, sir.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.694
Get me a side arm.

21:24.575 --> 21:25.815
I'll call her back.

21:30.998 --> 21:33.785
- Shit.
- Lost visual.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.708
Where is she, Albert?
Talk to me.

21:37.505 --> 21:38.995
Come on.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.712
North hallway.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.446
There, interrogation room, 
bring it up.

22:44.113 --> 22:46.399
Switch down, switch down.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.406
Have you found him?

22:53.581 --> 22:55.412
<i>What the hell are you doing, Ev?</i>

22:55.583 --> 22:56.743
This doesn't look good.

22:57.418 --> 22:58.658
- Let's do it.
- Move.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.293
There's a tac team coming at you
in 30 seconds.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.919
Get your goddamn panties off the camera.

23:03.090 --> 23:05.251
<i>Get where we can see you
so you don't get hurt.</i>

23:05.426 --> 23:08.418
- Have you found my husband?
- <i>These boys aren't fooling around, Ev.</i>

23:13.100 --> 23:15.762
<i>Please. I can't help you
unless you talk to me.</i>

23:15.936 --> 23:17.472
Call me when you find Mike.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.936
<i>Sweeping corridors outside the elevator.</i>

23:25.112 --> 23:26.648
Put the masks on.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.107
Situation is hot.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.449
<i>Okay, open the door about two feet.
We're gonna gas her.</i>

23:40.628 --> 23:42.619
Tac team in position.
Waiting for a go.

23:42.796 --> 23:44.002
Is that absolutely necessary?

23:44.173 --> 23:45.959
What, you want me to shoot her?

23:46.300 --> 23:48.336
Get a medical team in place now.

24:01.941 --> 24:03.556
We're ready.

24:07.988 --> 24:08.977
Now.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.827
<i>Okay, on my count.</i>

24:17.998 --> 24:21.536
<i>Three, two, one. Go.</i>

24:28.425 --> 24:29.835
Jesus Christ.

24:43.691 --> 24:46.899
Where is she? 
Come on, guys.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.936
- Find her, Albert. Now.
- <i>Suspect has escaped.</i>

24:50.364 --> 24:52.150
There. Bring that up.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.071
Stay with her,
she's crossing the street.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.736
Pan the goddamn camera!

25:10.884 --> 25:12.374
Back that up and zoom in.

25:12.553 --> 25:14.089
We're looking for Michael Krause.

25:14.263 --> 25:15.719
Freeze.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.179
We're looking for her husband, Mike Krause.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.556
What the hell are you doing, Ev?

25:19.977 --> 25:22.559
Wait, when was that?
No. No message.

25:22.980 --> 25:25.346
Let's switch to the exterior cameras.

25:25.524 --> 25:28.436
Michael Krause left his office
at the Smithsonian an hour ago.

25:28.610 --> 25:30.350
Salt’s apartment is 20 minutes from here.

25:30.529 --> 25:32.485
We can cover it,
but she won't go there.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.318
She will if she's serious about Mike.
This stays in-house.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.028
Okay.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.908
Taxi!

25:42.458 --> 25:44.369
U Street. 
I'll tell you when to stop.

25:52.217 --> 25:56.210
<i>Hi, this is Mike. 
Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

26:22.664 --> 26:25.155
He's one of the
world's top arachnologists, Ev,

26:25.334 --> 26:28.417
and as such, enjoys pretty much
unrestricted access

26:28.587 --> 26:30.999
to the borders of North Korea.

26:31.173 --> 26:35.041
So, brush up on your bugs
and get to know him.

26:36.345 --> 26:39.132
<i>He's the perfect cover
to get us inside.</i>

27:18.929 --> 27:20.419
Mike?

27:23.016 --> 27:26.008
Mike? Honey?

27:32.359 --> 27:34.395
Hey, baby. Hey, baby.

27:34.570 --> 27:36.526
It's all right. Shh.

27:36.738 --> 27:39.855
It's okay. Where's Daddy?
Where's Daddy?

28:13.400 --> 28:15.061
Come on. Come on.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.860
Check for back exits.

28:40.636 --> 28:42.422
Go! Go!

28:46.433 --> 28:48.674
Bedroom, clear!

28:50.103 --> 28:52.059
Kitchen is clear.

28:53.774 --> 28:55.856
Office, clear!

28:56.318 --> 28:58.775
Living room, clear!

29:25.514 --> 29:27.596
Everybody out. Sixty seconds.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.166
Come here.

29:58.338 --> 29:59.748
What are you doing?

29:59.923 --> 30:02.414
She's not here.
No sign of the husband either.

30:02.592 --> 30:05.083
Did it ever occur to you that 
maybe that Russian was lying?

30:05.262 --> 30:06.752
- Why'd she run?
- I don’t know.

30:06.930 --> 30:09.842
Because you were gonna lock her up?
See it from her perspective.

30:10.017 --> 30:12.099
Maybe her husband
is in some real danger.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.510
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.345
"Maybe" is your department.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.185
Mine is catching her 
so we can find out.

30:19.359 --> 30:22.021
Protocol is clear. We bring her in
or we bring her down.

30:22.195 --> 30:24.311
Do you have any idea
who this woman is?

30:24.489 --> 30:27.526
What she’s done for this country?
Does that mean anything to you?

30:27.701 --> 30:28.907
Should it?

30:32.372 --> 30:33.737
- Is your mom home?
- No.

30:33.915 --> 30:35.530
- No? Can you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.870
Hi. You baby-sit Burt for me?

30:38.045 --> 30:42.038
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah? Here's some money for food.

30:42.591 --> 30:43.956
Hi, Burt.

30:44.134 --> 30:45.920
What you doing?
You doing homework?

30:46.094 --> 30:48.130
Yeah, math.

30:49.181 --> 30:51.968
- Algebra.
- I hate math.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.061
Hi. Nice to see you again.

31:05.238 --> 31:08.822
- You talking to me?
- Yeah, I've seen you here before.

31:09.743 --> 31:13.327
Yeah, I-- 
Yeah, I come here a lot.

31:13.497 --> 31:14.486
You?

31:14.664 --> 31:16.154
Oh, I’m working here.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.539
At the museum.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.576
- I'm an arachnologist.
- A what?

31:20.754 --> 31:22.995
A spider hunter.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.502
You look like one.

31:30.055 --> 31:34.264
There are 40,000 species
of spiders in the world.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.972
And that one is mine.

31:38.146 --> 31:39.181
You discovered it.

31:39.356 --> 31:40.596
Inside North Korea.

31:42.442 --> 31:46.276
I named it Terrijoolsima Peterbesti.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.528
Do you get that?

31:51.159 --> 31:52.569
No. Should I?

31:52.744 --> 31:55.406
Peterbesti? 
I named it after Pete Best.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.116
The first drummer before Ringo.

31:58.125 --> 32:01.458
Best never was a famous Beatle,

32:03.713 --> 32:07.297
but now he's a famous spider.

32:28.738 --> 32:29.818
I got her.

32:29.990 --> 32:32.732
<i>She's heading north
towards the Metro station.</i>

32:33.410 --> 32:34.490
Ev!

32:58.894 --> 33:00.384
Ev!

33:10.489 --> 33:12.946
She's eastbound,
in the Penn Quarter Mall.

33:16.870 --> 33:18.360
Excuse me.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.040
<i>Will do. Headed there now.</i>

33:32.219 --> 33:33.925
There she is.

33:34.513 --> 33:37.380
All teams, southbound toward the bridge. 
Box her in.

33:48.276 --> 33:49.311
Circle around!

33:49.528 --> 33:51.234
Salt! Stop!

33:51.404 --> 33:53.690
- Keep her in your sights!
- Coming up behind you!

33:53.865 --> 33:55.230
Fuck!

33:59.329 --> 34:01.240
Keep back! Hold your fire!

34:01.748 --> 34:03.613
Salt! Down!

34:05.252 --> 34:06.913
Salt!

34:13.260 --> 34:14.716
Spread out!

34:15.804 --> 34:17.920
- Salt!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot, I'm innocent!

34:18.098 --> 34:20.214
- On the ground. Now!
- Please don't. No!

34:20.391 --> 34:23.429
Down! Salt! Do it now!
On the ground!

34:23.603 --> 34:24.809
I have to find my husband.

34:24.980 --> 34:26.766
- Why'd you run?
- I have to find my husband!

34:26.940 --> 34:28.726
- That’s not a reason.
- Please, don't shoot.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.264
- Stay back!
- Last chance.

34:30.443 --> 34:32.934
I'm innocent.
Somebody is setting me up!

34:33.112 --> 34:35.445
- Don't make me put you down, Salt.
- Put the goddamn gun down!

34:35.614 --> 34:37.150
- Give yourself up!
- Come on, Ev.

34:37.367 --> 34:39.858
Do what he says.
We'll sort this out, I promise.

34:40.161 --> 34:43.277
I gotta bring you in, Salt.
It's over. Face down.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.072
Somebody's going to try 
to kill the Russian president.

34:46.251 --> 34:48.993
Do something about that!
That's what you should worry about.

34:49.379 --> 34:51.460
There's nowhere to run! 
Quit now!

34:51.630 --> 34:52.962
No, I didn't do anything.

34:53.132 --> 34:54.498
Get back! No!

35:02.475 --> 35:05.137
She's on a blue semi.
Route 1, heading north.

35:05.312 --> 35:07.143
Get a roadblock in place now.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.153
<i>Metro Police on alert.</i>

35:59.240 --> 36:02.357
There she is. 
On the tanker.

36:03.036 --> 36:05.072
Stop. Stop!

36:15.465 --> 36:17.001
Ev!

36:32.941 --> 36:35.307
You, my friend, 
have got a mole in your group.

36:35.735 --> 36:38.727
- We don't know that yet.
- I'd say she's a trained goddamn liar

36:38.905 --> 36:41.612
and everything she's said up until now
has been to protect her cover.

36:41.783 --> 36:44.399
Well, why don’t you tell me
how you really feel about it?

37:34.794 --> 37:37.251
Get up on the shoulder!
Get up on the shoulder!

37:56.775 --> 37:57.855
Okay, take it down.

38:08.578 --> 38:09.693
Shit!

38:12.999 --> 38:14.034
Shit!

38:20.632 --> 38:21.667
Okay.

38:22.175 --> 38:24.461
Ted, I know you're her friend,

38:25.178 --> 38:27.089
but we gotta drop a net on New York.

38:27.472 --> 38:30.339
- We gotta do it now.
- Let's go!

38:33.019 --> 38:36.432
Notify the Secret Service
on Matveyev's detail.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.353
Tell them Salt might be coming their way.

38:41.694 --> 38:46.233
And if she is, 
Orlov may not be far behind either.

38:48.243 --> 38:49.278
You seen this?

38:49.452 --> 38:51.864
Salt spent time in Russia as a kid.

38:52.288 --> 38:56.327
She was in a car accident with her parents 
in '88. They both died.

38:57.752 --> 39:02.371
They were teachers at the U.S. Embassy
for the American children of the staff.

39:02.799 --> 39:05.506
That's why we put her on Russia 
in the first place.

39:07.220 --> 39:10.553
We need to get on a plane
to New York, tonight.

39:11.140 --> 39:14.223
<i>Send everything we've got on Orlov to N.Y.P.D.</i>

40:08.656 --> 40:11.864
<i>And here in New York City,
security has been beefed up</i>

40:12.035 --> 40:14.651
<i>and preparations are continuing
well into the night</i>

40:14.829 --> 40:17.912
<i>for the funeral of
Vice President Maxwell Oates.</i>

40:18.082 --> 40:22.621
<i>Among the dignitaries attending the service 
at St. Bartholomew’s Church</i>

40:22.795 --> 40:25.252
<i>is Russian president Boris Matveyev,</i>

40:25.423 --> 40:27.914
<i>who arrived here in Manhattan
earlier this evening.</i>

40:28.092 --> 40:33.052
<i>Public transportation will experience delays, 
with subway closures and...</i>

40:36.809 --> 40:38.094
Evelyn.

40:38.561 --> 40:40.301
Look at me.

40:42.815 --> 40:45.147
If there was a way,
I would kill them.

40:48.112 --> 40:49.943
You shouldn't have come here.

40:50.114 --> 40:52.651
What do you mean?
I don't understand.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.526
Now they know who you are.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.570
Who?

40:59.582 --> 41:01.413
Evelyn.

41:02.627 --> 41:04.458
Who?

41:06.589 --> 41:08.796
I would accept anything about you,

41:08.967 --> 41:10.707
but I need to know.

41:10.885 --> 41:13.968
So look at me. 
Look at me.

41:15.974 --> 41:18.636
Just tell me, okay?

41:19.185 --> 41:20.300
Just tell me.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.554
I work...

41:25.984 --> 41:27.474
I work for the CIA.

41:29.988 --> 41:31.979
So you see, there's...

41:33.032 --> 41:35.899
There's no future for us.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.987
You're not safe with me.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.494
I don't wanna be safe.

41:47.005 --> 41:48.711
I know you,

41:49.340 --> 41:51.547
and I wanna be with you.

41:52.802 --> 41:56.340
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

41:58.307 --> 41:59.797
Okay?

42:01.227 --> 42:04.640
Okay. Okay.

42:24.375 --> 42:28.584
Welcome to New York, Miss Hernandez. 
One night, a deluxe room.

42:29.047 --> 42:30.878
Do you need any help
with your luggage?

42:31.049 --> 42:32.209
Nope, I got it. Thanks.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.384
I'll put these in the closet, sir?

42:41.559 --> 42:43.174
Yeah, fine.

44:10.523 --> 44:12.012
<i>I do solemnly swear...</i>

44:12.191 --> 44:13.680
I do solemnly swear...

44:13.860 --> 44:20.857
that I will support and defend
the Constitution of the United States

44:21.033 --> 44:26.323
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

44:26.497 --> 44:30.160
That I will faithfully discharge

44:30.334 --> 44:32.871
the duties of the office
on which I'm about to enter.

44:33.254 --> 44:36.087
The duties of the office
on which I am about to enter.

44:36.257 --> 44:39.545
- So help me God.
- So help me God.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.803
<i>A solemn day here in New York City.</i>

44:47.977 --> 44:50.889
<i>The funeral of Vice President 
Maxwell Oates,</i>

44:51.063 --> 44:54.772
<i>a former five-term U.S. senator
and Cold War warrior</i>

44:54.942 --> 44:57.308
<i>whose greatest legacy
may be as architect</i>

44:57.486 --> 45:00.774
of the new era
of Russian-American relations.

45:00.948 --> 45:02.939
Russian president Boris Matveyev

45:03.117 --> 45:05.904
<i>has journeyed from Moscow
to be an honorary pallbearer</i>

45:06.078 --> 45:10.287
<i>to the man he's called
his greatest friend in the West.</i>

46:08.140 --> 46:10.472
What's the security perimeter?

46:10.643 --> 46:13.680
We're two deep inside
and we own this entire block.

46:13.854 --> 46:17.187
And those are Secret Service agents, 
not CIA.

46:17.358 --> 46:20.816
- So relax.
- That's real funny.

46:21.362 --> 46:23.523
Didn’t know you guys told jokes.

46:27.493 --> 46:28.608
Detail, halt.

46:30.871 --> 46:33.032
Forward, march.

46:49.890 --> 46:54.304
<i>Due to the funeral,
the 51st Street station is closed.</i>

46:57.648 --> 47:02.813
<i>Repeat: Due to the funeral,
the 51st Street station is closed.</i>

47:07.074 --> 47:09.065
What--? 
Hey, what's going on?

47:09.243 --> 47:10.653
Hey! There's smoke.

47:12.830 --> 47:15.947
Step back, step back. 
Everybody, move out of the way.

47:50.451 --> 47:52.737
Eleanor. 
Good to see you.

47:53.287 --> 47:55.027
Thank you.

47:57.833 --> 48:00.996
- Boris.
- Mr. President.

48:05.299 --> 48:06.835
Hello.

48:17.853 --> 48:20.060
Please be seated.

48:32.076 --> 48:34.658
<i>Stand by for president's speech.</i>

48:36.372 --> 48:40.832
<i>Patrolling church exterior.
No one in or out the side doors.</i>

48:42.420 --> 48:43.580
Mrs. Oates.

48:45.172 --> 48:48.756
Eleanor, Joe, Marissa, Donald...

48:48.926 --> 48:53.010
After the president, the choir sings,
then Matveyev delivers the eulogy.

48:53.180 --> 48:56.343
If your girl tries anything here,
it'd have to be pretty amazing.

49:00.729 --> 49:05.348
<i>I knew he would bring more to the job 
than just his years of experience.</i>

49:05.693 --> 49:07.809
As vice president,

49:07.987 --> 49:12.526
he showed the world the best
of what it is to be an American.

49:13.033 --> 49:14.318
And today,

49:14.493 --> 49:19.237
the world says goodbye to a great man.

49:28.591 --> 49:30.206
I'll check the back.

49:30.384 --> 49:32.716
Lima Zulu 4, clear.

49:58.746 --> 50:01.078
<i>My friendship with Maxwell Oates</i>

50:01.248 --> 50:04.240
began in the unlikeliest of places:

50:04.418 --> 50:06.283
<i>Lima Zulu 4, come in.</i>

50:06.462 --> 50:08.327
<i>Across the negotiating table...</i>

50:08.506 --> 50:10.246
<i>What's your status, Lima Zulu 4?</i>

50:10.424 --> 50:11.630
We got two MIAs.

50:11.800 --> 50:16.920
Lima Zulu 4 in the utility tunnel 
outside the crypt entrance and Lima Zulu 5.

50:17.097 --> 50:20.214
I'm heading down to the crypt.
Some kind of trouble down there.

50:20.392 --> 50:22.007
What's going on, guys?
Talk to me.

50:22.186 --> 50:25.303
Subunits Lima Zulu 1, 2 and 3,
converge on the crypt. Repeat:

50:25.481 --> 50:26.561
<i>Converge on the crypt.</i>

50:26.732 --> 50:28.768
He made all the difference,
and for that,

50:28.943 --> 50:33.812
he will always have
my respect and admiration.

51:19.661 --> 51:22.617
That is what my friend Maxwell Oates
would have said.

51:29.420 --> 51:30.580
What's going on?

51:41.432 --> 51:42.968
Matveyev.

51:43.851 --> 51:45.011
Get goddamn Matveyev.

52:00.159 --> 52:02.821
- Get the bomb squad in here!
- Go, go!

52:42.534 --> 52:44.240
Drop it!

52:46.246 --> 52:47.281
Drop it!

52:54.213 --> 52:57.501
- Any MTs down here?
- I see her.

52:57.675 --> 53:00.417
- Keep your hands up!
- Shooter's at 12 o'clock.

53:00.594 --> 53:03.836
- Gun! She's got a gun. She has a gun!
- Don't move!

53:04.014 --> 53:06.221
- Do not move! Do not move!
- Keep your hands up!

53:06.392 --> 53:08.007
Take her down, take her down!

53:08.185 --> 53:09.641
Check for other weapons.

53:10.896 --> 53:13.057
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

53:13.232 --> 53:15.063
I can’t feel a pulse.

53:15.401 --> 53:18.359
Jurisdiction is clear.
This is New York City.

53:18.529 --> 53:20.986
N.Y.P.D. has her.
She's going to 1 Police Plaza.

53:21.156 --> 53:23.693
- I'm not arguing jurisdiction.
- We don't know yet, sir.

53:23.867 --> 53:26.449
- The shooter is CIA. I know her.
- Yes, I'll be there.

53:26.620 --> 53:28.076
I'll be on the next chopper out, sir.

53:28.247 --> 53:31.364
- Have your superior call the mayor.
- Open up, guy, open up!

53:33.085 --> 53:34.416
Back it up! Back it up!

53:34.586 --> 53:37.544
Come on, guys. Keep moving.
Keep moving. Keep moving.

53:38.924 --> 53:40.130
Let's go, let's go.

53:40.300 --> 53:41.915
Hey, watch this guy, watch this guy.

53:42.094 --> 53:43.334
- Back up!
- Keep moving.

53:43.512 --> 53:44.592
Sir, back up!

53:44.763 --> 53:47.505
Why? Why?

53:49.059 --> 53:51.801
Do you have any idea
how much blood is on your hands?

53:51.979 --> 53:53.560
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.

53:53.731 --> 53:55.767
I'm gonna see to it personally!
A dark goddamn hole!

53:55.941 --> 53:57.431
Get a hold of yourself.

53:58.110 --> 53:59.600
Get the door, get the door.

53:59.778 --> 54:02.440
- Get off me!
- Back off, man! Back off!

54:02.614 --> 54:03.945
That's it. Let's go.

54:05.033 --> 54:06.898
Stand back.

54:07.619 --> 54:10.156
Close it! Go, go, go!

54:22.426 --> 54:25.964
Matveyev was declared dead
en route to the hospital.

54:26.388 --> 54:27.719
Jesus Christ.

54:28.140 --> 54:29.300
Yeah.

54:29.600 --> 54:31.636
You were right about her.

54:32.644 --> 54:35.135
She had the drop on me, Ted.

54:36.482 --> 54:38.222
Why didn't she shoot?

55:03.842 --> 55:05.457
<i>Natasha.</i>

55:06.178 --> 55:07.839
Natasha.

55:08.138 --> 55:09.753
Is that you?

55:10.557 --> 55:13.014
Did they give you a new face?

55:14.019 --> 55:16.852
I'm going home tomorrow, Shnaider.

55:17.356 --> 55:18.846
Home to Grozny?

55:19.024 --> 55:23.267
My home is in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

55:24.571 --> 55:28.905
My favorite place there
is McDonald's on Fern Street

55:29.201 --> 55:31.408
because it's near the river.

55:32.454 --> 55:34.740
But I won't want to go there anymore

55:35.123 --> 55:38.081
because my mother and father are dead.

55:38.627 --> 55:39.958
Natasha,

55:41.547 --> 55:43.333
will you miss me?

55:44.424 --> 55:48.633
My name is Evelyn Salt.

56:08.782 --> 56:11.068
Cop down, cop down! 
Hear me!

56:59.374 --> 57:03.617
Get out of the car
with your hands on your head!

57:03.837 --> 57:06.624
Right now! 
Hands in the air!

57:23.690 --> 57:27.353
- Hey, did you see that?
- Hey, get those guys over here.

57:27.527 --> 57:29.813
Get them over here to help.

57:44.836 --> 57:47.418
Somebody help me get him out.
Help me get him out.

58:22.457 --> 58:24.163
<i>What college will you attend?</i>

58:24.334 --> 58:26.199
Princeton University.

58:26.378 --> 58:27.538
Where will you work?

58:27.713 --> 58:29.704
The Central Intelligence Agency.

58:29.881 --> 58:31.621
Who will you trust?

58:31.800 --> 58:33.506
No one.

58:33.677 --> 58:36.043
Be very patient.

58:36.221 --> 58:37.927
Remember your training.

58:38.890 --> 58:42.098
Remember, you're not the only one.

58:42.269 --> 58:43.884
There are many others.

58:44.062 --> 58:47.350
All of you waiting to strike.

58:47.524 --> 58:49.606
- Yes.
- And we will strike.

58:50.318 --> 58:53.481
- Together.
- Yes.

58:56.074 --> 58:57.564
Wait.

59:00.328 --> 59:04.241
One day, I will come for all of you.

59:10.338 --> 59:12.078
Hello, Evelyn.

59:12.424 --> 59:15.587
I'm Martin Crenshaw from the U.S. Embassy.

59:16.261 --> 59:19.674
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

59:26.772 --> 59:30.606
<i>Rioters outside the U.S. Embassy
cheered their new leader's words</i>

59:30.776 --> 59:34.268
<i>and called on him to take strong action 
against what they are calling</i>

59:34.446 --> 59:38.064
<i>a state-sponsored act of terrorism
on the part of the U.S.</i>

59:38.241 --> 59:40.277
<i>These riots are sparking
similar outbreaks</i>

59:40.452 --> 59:43.615
<i>of anti-American protests across Russia.</i>

59:43.789 --> 59:46.952
<i>"We will strike back,"
says the new Russian president,</i>

59:47.125 --> 59:49.537
<i>angrily condemning today's assassination</i>

59:49.711 --> 59:53.169
<i>by American intelligence officer Evelyn Salt.</i>

59:53.757 --> 59:57.341
<i>Even as the body of slain President Matveyev 
is on its Way back to Moscow,</i>

59:57.511 --> 01:00:00.093
<i>anti-American riots
have erupted across Russia,</i>

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:02.970
<i>with bombings of U.S. Diplomats' cars in Moscow.</i>

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:07.221
<i>The Russian armed forces
have been put on high alert.</i>

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:10.429
<i>Responding to a rapidly escalating crisis,</i>

01:00:10.607 --> 01:00:13.815
<i>President Lewis has called for
an emergency White House meeting</i>

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:17.398
<i>with cabinet members, military leaders 
and NATO representatives.</i>

01:00:17.572 --> 01:00:20.484
Greetings, Comrade Chenkov!

01:00:26.665 --> 01:00:29.577
When I saw you in Washington,
I almost ran to you.

01:00:37.008 --> 01:00:39.715
You were not supposed to get married.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:44.300
Not unless it had great tactical advantage.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.180
I did it to seem normal.

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:49.009
When you escaped today, I thought:

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:53.351
"Even I could not have hoped for so much."

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:57.393
You are my greatest creation.

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.733
You trained me well.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:40.352
My husband, you have him?

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:42.896
I had to be certain.

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:45.156
But now you trust me?

01:01:45.327 --> 01:01:46.362
Completely.

01:01:54.586 --> 01:01:58.499
So, tell me what's next.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:00.998
Next, part two:

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:05.502
We seize control 
of this country's atomic weapons.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:07.796
How?

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:09.589
You'll see.

01:02:10.936 --> 01:02:12.176
All right.

01:02:57.649 --> 01:03:00.015
Are you ready to watch him die?

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:09.528
Give me the gun.

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:13.445
That would be too easy.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.801
Satisfied?

01:04:16.311 --> 01:04:17.517
I'm satisfied.

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:21.179
Comrades,

01:04:21.483 --> 01:04:25.101
our sister has rejoined us.

01:04:25.487 --> 01:04:28.570
Russia will rise from the ashes

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:32.198
of the greatest war
the world has ever seen.

01:04:33.912 --> 01:04:36.028
And the world will hear us!

01:04:36.539 --> 01:04:37.870
Will hear.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.708
Welcome back to our family, sister.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:46.708
Sister.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:05:00.807
Russia has changed.
But our lives will not be wasted.

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:07.234
You're to meet an agent,
NATO uniform, at a plane here.

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:13.357
Tail number N182SL.

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:18.908
Final instructions will come from him.

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:22.206
- That's it.
- That's it.

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:25.414
After this, we go dark.

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:28.213
Radio silent.

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:31.003
You won't hear from me again,

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:32.834
my daughter.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:35.962
<i>Forever and ever.</i>

01:07:59.117 --> 01:08:01.529
Have you heard from Orlov?

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:03.864
Yes. Last word was "go."

01:08:08.668 --> 01:08:10.374
Chenkov.

01:08:11.921 --> 01:08:13.536
Do you remember me?

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.001
<i>Chenkov.</i>

01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:23.050
Did you miss me?

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.805
Shnaider?

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:30.640
How long have you been here?

01:08:33.067 --> 01:08:37.106
I left Russia one year after you.
To Prague.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:40.981
I've been the NATO liaison
to the White House for three years.

01:08:41.408 --> 01:08:44.071
Colonel Edward Tomas.

01:08:44.412 --> 01:08:47.575
And you are my attaché.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:49.410
Your ID.

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:52.416
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:55.499
More importantly, our mission.

01:08:55.881 --> 01:09:00.296
The bunker eight stories
below the White House.

01:09:02.263 --> 01:09:04.002
That's where the president needs to be.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.430
How do we do it?

01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:14.689
Don't worry, he'll be there. That's my job. 
I'll make sure he's there.

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:18.984
- What's my job?
- Do you remember, Chenkov,

01:09:19.154 --> 01:09:22.898
when we were young and you had 
to finish first in everything?

01:09:23.076 --> 01:09:24.816
Had to be the best at everything.

01:09:25.036 --> 01:09:29.029
Even though you knew you would be beaten
with a cane, you had to finish first.

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:30.787
I remember.

01:09:30.957 --> 01:09:34.450
Tonight you will finish
ahead of me again.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:41.462
Tonight you will kill America's president.

01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:56.146
IDs, please.

01:09:56.818 --> 01:09:58.934
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.856
I'll check the side.

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:05.148
Control, this is Hayes.

01:10:05.326 --> 01:10:08.193
I have a Colonel Tomas and a Major Vicek.

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:09.702
Undercarriage is clean.

01:10:10.998 --> 01:10:11.987
Back's clean.

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:16.626
Colonel. Major. 
All clear.

01:10:29.016 --> 01:10:31.132
You know the drill, colonel.

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:34.893
Shrapnel. A Serbian landmine.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:38.056
They've spent more time looking at it
than the doctor did.

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:43.687
Step through, please, sir.

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:48.778
Turn around.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:53.863
Thank you.

01:10:58.379 --> 01:11:01.121
- Step through. Arms out.
- Patience is key.

01:11:01.299 --> 01:11:04.382
I've been coming here for two years,
others have been here even longer.

01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:06.884
- What others?
- I don't know.

01:11:07.054 --> 01:11:10.217
But you were the best of us
and I was the least.

01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:13.849
There must be others,
here to finish what we begin.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.726
Colonel Tomas.
Good to see you again.

01:11:15.897 --> 01:11:17.103
- Major Vicek.
- Pleasure.

01:11:17.273 --> 01:11:20.185
You have exactly two minutes to preview 
NATO's point of view before the main meeting.

01:11:21.694 --> 01:11:24.527
Now, Ted, your Russian CIA agent, Salt.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:28.030
- What can you tell us about her?
- We think she may be a Soviet plant,

01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:33.911
inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB called Day X.

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:38.245
A day that would mark the start of a large 
scale strike against the U.S. and her allies.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:48.001
This should be the president now.

01:11:50.932 --> 01:11:53.139
You have a big job, Chenkov,

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:54.594
but you can do it.

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:57.097
You still haven't told me
what your job is.

01:11:57.396 --> 01:11:59.136
Home.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.055
I'm going home.

01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:06.936
- Down! Take cover!
- Get the president!

01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:09.572
- A gun! He’s got a gun!
- Get back!

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:13.196
Get back!

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:27.794
- Are you okay, sir?
- Yes.

01:12:27.969 --> 01:12:30.711
- Goddamn it.
- Geronimo is SOP, downward mobile.

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:37.557
Help, over here!

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:42.142
Get a medic! Get a medic!

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:51.314
I think I saw her.

01:12:51.742 --> 01:12:53.357
You saw who?

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.614
Salt.

01:12:57.748 --> 01:12:59.363
I think I saw her in the corridor.

01:13:01.878 --> 01:13:03.414
The other NATO officer.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:08.047
She's here.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:10.712
Check.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:12.252
- Clear.
- Move.

01:13:12.972 --> 01:13:14.007
Go!

01:13:14.181 --> 01:13:16.763
We may have a visual on a second assailant. 
Evelyn Salt.

01:13:16.934 --> 01:13:20.097
Repeat: Evelyn Salt on premises.
May be dressed as a NATO officer.

01:13:21.063 --> 01:13:24.555
<i>This is not a drill.
The White House is under attack.</i>

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:28.602
<i>If you are near an exit, 
please proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

01:13:28.779 --> 01:13:30.565
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

01:13:31.073 --> 01:13:33.405
I need this hallway cleared
to the left, now!

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:37.702
Command, this is Jenks. 
I need the PEOC bunker up and running.

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:40.238
If this was authorized
by the Russian government,

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:42.953
it is an act of war,
and we will respond.

01:13:44.253 --> 01:13:48.371
<i>If you are near an exit, 
please proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

01:13:48.549 --> 01:13:50.460
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

01:13:50.635 --> 01:13:52.296
- Clear!
- Let's go, sir.

01:13:55.014 --> 01:13:56.595
Alpha team! 
Move! Move! Move!

01:14:00.311 --> 01:14:01.926
Move, move.

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:03.936
Close it.

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:05.604
Close it.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.606
<i>Please proceed outside in an orderly manner.</i>

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.867
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:50.353
Go, go.

01:14:52.279 --> 01:14:54.816
Geronimo approaching
bunker door in five seconds.

01:14:59.578 --> 01:15:00.943
Clear.

01:15:08.963 --> 01:15:10.203
Any chance she could follow?

01:15:10.381 --> 01:15:12.463
My own men couldn't get through that door,
once it's close.

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:15.295
Yeah, well, unfortunately,
she isn't one of yours.

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:20.671
Okay, go.

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.182
Stay until it’s shut and sealed.

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:30.063
Geronimo secured.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:00.503
- Get me Director Medford.
- Yes, sir.

01:16:01.348 --> 01:16:04.385
Sir, I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.427
that today, right now,
could be the start of Day X.

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:10.638
Mr. President, Director Medford is up.

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:13.391
Marion, what's the situation?

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:16.561
<i>It should be coming up
on one of your screens.</i>

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:19.400
 What you see there
represents temperature drops

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:21.736
 in mobile missile units in Siberia.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:25.736
<i>It means the Russians are deploying
their missiles to the field.</i>

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:29.499
<i>And that's been confirmed
on the ground, Mr. President.</i>

01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:34.161
Mr. President, I strongly recommend
we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.752
At least at our forward bases.

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:39.542
Do it.

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:42.090
And since the Russians have deployed,

01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:46.007
we need to look at
our own nuclear attack options.

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:49.268
It's not on the table,
it's not a deterrent.

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:53.306
Thanks, Marion.
We'll come back to you.

01:17:13.587 --> 01:17:15.123
Sir.

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:21.251
The outer portal door is jammed.
No response.

01:17:21.428 --> 01:17:24.170
And we just lost the feed
from most of our security cameras.

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:26.964
We're blind down here
and no one can enter this facility.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:31.261
Command, our eyes are down both ways.
We have a PEOC outer security door malfunction.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:33.391
Get out there, now.

01:17:33.566 --> 01:17:35.431
Seal this room.

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:39.109
Down that corridor. 
Secure it.

01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:26.862
<i>Victims are being taken to
George Washington Hospital.</i>

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:31.075
<i>Reports are coming in that there
are casualties at the White House.</i>

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:34.323
This is President Howard Lewis.

01:18:34.501 --> 01:18:38.335
- <i>Proceed with authentication.</i>
- Yes, Mr. President.

01:18:42.551 --> 01:18:44.462
Ready to commence authentication.

01:18:44.637 --> 01:18:45.626
Zulu.

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:46.839
- Tango.
- Echo.

01:18:47.014 --> 01:18:48.003
- Seven.
- Niner.

01:18:48.182 --> 01:18:49.388
- Juliette.
- <i>X-ray.</i>

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:50.547
- <i>Sierra.</i>
- <i>Seven.</i>

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:51.715
- <i>Alfa.</i>
- Mike.

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:53.555
- Charlie.
- Whiskey.

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:54.718
- <i>Five.</i>
- <i>Six.</i>

01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:55.886
<i>Tango.</i>

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:58.021
<i>Authentication codes confirmed.</i>

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.565
<i>It's all yours now, Mr. President.</i>

01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:02.435
God be with you.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:07.277
Attack options and targeting
under your control, Mr. President.

01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:09.407
Anders and Nablo, 
what's your location?

01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:12.823
<i>Anders and Nablo, 
what’s your location?</i>

01:19:14.541 --> 01:19:17.453
Is the camera outside this door working? 
Put it up.

01:19:17.628 --> 01:19:19.664
Officer Dryer, what’s your status?

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:22.420
Officer Dryer, come in.

01:19:22.883 --> 01:19:25.374
<i>Federal Communication Commission</i>

01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:27.588
<i>is activating the Emergency Alert System.</i>

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:29.344
Who the hell's that?

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:33.053
That's her. 
That's Evelyn Salt.

01:19:33.227 --> 01:19:34.933
She's in. 
Go to DEFCON 1.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:36.594
Give me your side arm.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:40.310
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess 
firearms in the president's vicinity.

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:42.190
Screw protocol, James.
We got an enemy agent.

01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:44.317
Protocol is protocol, sir.

01:19:44.655 --> 01:19:47.488
And dead is dead.

01:19:48.242 --> 01:19:49.903
Behind me!

01:19:51.287 --> 01:19:52.993
I'm the national security advisor.

01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:54.486
Not anymore.

01:20:02.423 --> 01:20:03.458
Sit down.

01:20:06.844 --> 01:20:07.833
Who are you?

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:11.345
My name, Mr. President,
is Nikolai Tarkovsky.

01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:15.090
And unless you do exactly as I say,

01:20:15.436 --> 01:20:17.848
I will be the last person
you will ever see.

01:20:23.861 --> 01:20:26.193
Shall we look at some
selective attack options?

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:27.815
Go to hell.

01:20:54.767 --> 01:20:58.009
<i>Selective attack options ready.</i>

01:20:58.228 --> 01:20:59.638
<i>Ted?</i>

01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:04.933
<i>Emergency action message released by...</i>

01:21:05.402 --> 01:21:08.565
<i>Congratulations, Comrade Chenkov.
You made it.</i>

01:21:08.947 --> 01:21:10.858
Why didn't you tell me?

01:21:13.619 --> 01:21:15.655
I tried many times, but...

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:19.200
My loneliness was my only friend.

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:22.082
<i>You weren't with us in Russia.
I would have remembered you.</i>

01:21:22.252 --> 01:21:24.208
<i>I was a class ahead, comrade.</i>

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:26.662
<i>The brightest of any of Orlov's stars.</i>

01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:29.748
And now it's my honor
to launch the attack.

01:21:30.135 --> 01:21:31.671
Excuse me.

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:35.880
<i>Selective attack targets acquired.</i>

01:21:37.184 --> 01:21:38.674
<i>Tehran.</i>

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:40.429
<i>Mecca.</i>

01:21:41.188 --> 01:21:44.225
Mecca? Tehran?

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.061
<i>Part two of our plan.</i>

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:48.191
<i>Kill nine million people.</i>

01:21:48.904 --> 01:21:50.360
<i>Enrage a billion Muslims.</i>

01:21:51.365 --> 01:21:53.356
America will suffer a painful death.

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:57.868
<i>Permissive action links initiated.</i>

01:21:58.956 --> 01:22:01.572
<i>Missiles arming.</i>

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:10.213
<i>Nuclear command</i>

01:22:10.551 --> 01:22:13.213
<i>posts airborne.</i>

01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:14.718
Let me join you.

01:22:16.140 --> 01:22:19.052
<i>ICMs set to</i>

01:22:19.435 --> 01:22:21.676
<i>maximum yield.</i>

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:26.104
You know, when you first came to Langley,

01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:29.190
I didn't think I’d be able to do it.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:32.276
<i>I didn't think I'd be able to</i>

01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:35.989
resist the temptation to say something.

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:38.988
Then you met Mike and,

01:22:39.496 --> 01:22:43.409
well, things changed.

01:22:46.503 --> 01:22:47.788
<i>Let me join you.</i>

01:22:49.173 --> 01:22:53.257
All these years right in front of me
and I never knew.

01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:01.598
<i>Let me join you.</i>

01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:04.475
<i>I want to be with you.</i>

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:20.617
<i>The man we thought was dead has made
a resurrection that is miraculous.</i>

01:23:20.787 --> 01:23:22.493
<i>President Matveyev is alive.</i>

01:23:22.664 --> 01:23:24.780
<i>We're going to Russia.
What you are seeing</i>

01:23:24.958 --> 01:23:27.415
<i>are live pictures of
Russian president Matveyev</i>

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:31.454
<i>arriving at the airport outside of Moscow. 
This is astonishing.</i>

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:34.840
<i>According to his doctors,
President Matveyev's mistaken death</i>

01:23:35.010 --> 01:23:37.376
<i>is attributed to a temporary paralysis</i>

01:23:37.554 --> 01:23:40.091
<i>from a toxin derived from spider venom.</i>

01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:44.471
<i>A recap for those who may not 
have been following the events of the day...</i>

01:23:47.689 --> 01:23:49.725
<i>At least I was right.</i>

01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:56.103
<i>I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.</i>

01:23:56.406 --> 01:24:00.149
<i>I could see how moved you were
by Mike’s little white-knight routine.</i>

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:02.488
You were supposed to recruit him, Ev,

01:24:02.663 --> 01:24:04.278
not fall in love with him.

01:24:05.541 --> 01:24:07.657
<i>That's why I told Orlov to pick him up.</i>

01:24:10.170 --> 01:24:12.411
<i>By the way, how is Mike?</i>

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:16.465
<i>Orlov is dead.</i>

01:24:20.931 --> 01:24:23.217
Well, that’s good news.

01:24:23.475 --> 01:24:24.931
Saved me the trouble.

01:24:26.603 --> 01:24:31.017
<i>I had to practically twist his arm 
to get him to blow your cover at the CIA.</i>

01:24:32.818 --> 01:24:36.310
<i>You see, he wanted you
to come out of this thing alive.</i>    

01:24:39.658 --> 01:24:41.774
But you needed somebody
to take the blame.

01:24:42.995 --> 01:24:45.077
<i>I'm the patsy.</i>

01:24:48.375 --> 01:24:50.741
<i>And I’m the hero.</i>

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:55.420
Congratulations, Ev.

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:59.629
<i>You're about to become famous.</i>

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:36.918
<i>Identity confirmation requested.</i>

01:25:49.436 --> 01:25:52.394
<i>Identity confirmation requested.</i>

01:25:57.402 --> 01:25:59.017
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

01:26:14.002 --> 01:26:18.086
<i>Minuteman III ICBMs' batteries
up to power.</i>

01:26:57.462 --> 01:26:59.748
<i>Authorization, 99 percent.</i>

01:27:06.638 --> 01:27:07.923
Go!

01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.927
<i>Permissive action links initiated.</i>

01:27:11.101 --> 01:27:14.764
<i>Trident submarines at firing readiness.</i>

01:27:15.522 --> 01:27:16.602
<i>Permission to launch.</i>

01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:19.268
<i>Permission to launch.</i>

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.295
Get down on the floor, now!

01:27:51.057 --> 01:27:52.422
I said now!

01:27:57.439 --> 01:28:00.055
<i>Launch sequence aborted.
Systems restoring.</i>

01:28:00.233 --> 01:28:02.565
- Move, move, move!
- Show me your hands!

01:28:02.736 --> 01:28:04.852
- Get down!
- What is your name, sir?

01:28:05.030 --> 01:28:07.897
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the president.

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:11.274
Mr. President.

01:28:12.746 --> 01:28:15.032
Mr. President, can you hear me?

01:28:16.666 --> 01:28:18.497
- Hold still.
- EMT's on the way.

01:28:18.668 --> 01:28:20.579
Make sure they got body bags.
I got at least seven.

01:28:20.754 --> 01:28:22.290
She's wearing a vest.

01:28:22.672 --> 01:28:25.459
I'll meet you in five minutes in the 
conference room, I wanna get cleaned up.

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:27.215
And I want her alone in a room.

01:28:27.385 --> 01:28:29.842
If there are other KAs out there,
I want her talking.

01:28:30.055 --> 01:28:33.673
She won't talk. She's trained not to talk,
no matter what we do to her.

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:36.091
If we're gonna find these people, 
we gonna find them ourselves.

01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:38.476
Somebody already did.
At least some of them.

01:28:38.647 --> 01:28:41.514
Barge on the East River.
Twelve dead, including Orlov.

01:28:41.942 --> 01:28:43.352
Who did that?

01:28:45.529 --> 01:28:47.520
Don't know. 
Forensics are on it.

01:28:49.407 --> 01:28:51.648
I'm gonna get cleaned up.
I'll be right back.

01:28:58.041 --> 01:29:02.284
Well, sir, you're injured. Why don't you
have a seat? We'll take a look at you.

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:04.710
Are you okay?

01:29:05.549 --> 01:29:07.881
Pretty good gash there.

01:29:08.051 --> 01:29:10.667
Looks like you got 
a piece of glass in there.

01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:35.867
<i>She killed someone else.</i>

01:29:36.037 --> 01:29:38.699
<i>It's Winter. It's Ted Winter, sir.
You better get up here.</i>

01:29:47.966 --> 01:29:49.877
Check him. Check him!

01:29:50.677 --> 01:29:51.712
Checking vitals.

01:29:51.887 --> 01:29:54.674
- I'm not getting a pulse.
- I'm not getting much.

01:30:17.871 --> 01:30:19.532
Sit down!

01:30:20.790 --> 01:30:23.327
She's yours for 15 minutes
during the flight.

01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:25.913
- Give me your hands.
- Then she's the FBI's.

01:31:10.507 --> 01:31:12.088
Hey.

01:31:13.134 --> 01:31:14.715
Why'd you kill him?

01:31:15.011 --> 01:31:16.501
Because somebody had to.

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:31.100
What?

01:31:42.122 --> 01:31:45.034
By this, I take it you think
everybody is who they say they are.

01:31:46.292 --> 01:31:48.874
You knew something was wrong
the moment Orlov walked in.

01:31:49.045 --> 01:31:50.455
So did I.

01:31:50.630 --> 01:31:52.916
We just didn't know what it was.

01:31:53.383 --> 01:31:56.375
- Winter did.
- Winter?

01:31:58.221 --> 01:32:01.429
You expect me to believe that Winter 
was gonna launch the missiles

01:32:01.599 --> 01:32:03.510
and you saved the world?

01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:07.807
I would like you to believe that, yeah.

01:32:09.649 --> 01:32:11.230
That's a big accusation.

01:32:12.402 --> 01:32:13.733
Well,

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:17.566
he’s dead now
so he can’t defend himself.

01:32:17.782 --> 01:32:21.070
I guess you'll just have to
decide for yourself.

01:32:28.209 --> 01:32:30.165
How many more like you are there?

01:32:30.754 --> 01:32:32.415
Like me?

01:32:33.506 --> 01:32:35.246
None.

01:32:35.925 --> 01:32:37.335
Like him?

01:32:37.510 --> 01:32:39.876
More than you or I can handle alone.

01:32:42.599 --> 01:32:45.261
You really think a trained Soviet agent

01:32:45.435 --> 01:32:50.020
couldn't kill the Russian president
at point-blank range if she wanted to?

01:32:54.152 --> 01:32:56.438
Or you, for that matter.

01:32:57.113 --> 01:32:59.399
I could've killed you at the funeral 
and I didn't.

01:32:59.908 --> 01:33:02.445
You surrendered to me
because I gave you no choice.

01:33:02.619 --> 01:33:04.530
You know better.

01:33:05.538 --> 01:33:07.779
I had a choice.

01:33:08.416 --> 01:33:09.576
You know better.

01:33:29.813 --> 01:33:32.054
If I did believe you,

01:33:32.232 --> 01:33:36.020
and I'm not saying for a second
that I do, but if I did,

01:33:37.946 --> 01:33:39.652
nobody else would.

01:33:41.282 --> 01:33:44.490
Well, maybe you can
think of a way around that.

01:33:55.839 --> 01:33:58.376
They took everything from me.

01:34:00.135 --> 01:34:01.921
I'll kill them.

01:34:15.984 --> 01:34:18.350
ETA, four minutes.

01:34:25.368 --> 01:34:26.448
Bullshit!

01:34:38.882 --> 01:34:42.215
We are approaching the Potomac, 
heading due south and west.

01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:49.552
Go get them.

01:35:09.913 --> 01:35:10.993
Salt!

01:35:19.672 --> 01:35:23.130
Circle back! Circle back!

01:36:19.482 --> 01:36:22.098
<i>New U.S. President Joseph Steppens
announced today</i>

01:36:22.277 --> 01:36:24.268
<i>that with the death of Natasha Chenkov,</i>

01:36:24.445 --> 01:36:28.154
<i>known in the U.S. as Evelyn Salt,
all elements of the terrorist group</i>

01:36:28.324 --> 01:36:30.656
<i>have been eliminated.
The announcement came</i>

01:36:30.827 --> 01:36:32.692
<i>during his Moscow peacekeeping visit</i>

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:35.282
<i>where President Steppens paused
