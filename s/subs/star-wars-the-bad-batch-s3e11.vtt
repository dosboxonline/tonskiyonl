01:11.791 --> 01:12.958
[droid beeping]

01:13.041 --> 01:16.958
The next time I give you an order
to scour through the green goo,

01:17.041 --> 01:18.583
you scour through the green goo.

01:18.666 --> 01:19.750
[droid beeps]

01:19.833 --> 01:21.833
Even if it melted your circuits,

01:21.916 --> 01:25.375
I'd repair you like I did
that time on Andro Prime.

01:26.250 --> 01:27.708
And Skara Nal.

01:27.791 --> 01:29.250
[droid beeping]

01:29.333 --> 01:31.833
[scoffs] Fill it up, Olly. The usual.

01:31.916 --> 01:34.583
- Mmm. You got it, Phee.
- [droid beeps]

01:34.666 --> 01:37.083
[Phee] Who cares
if your panels don't match?

01:37.166 --> 01:39.458
Patchy bodywork shows grit.

01:41.083 --> 01:42.500
[droid beeping]

01:42.583 --> 01:46.250
All right, all right.
I won't push you in next time.

[droid beeping]

02:21.125 --> 02:23.541
You're grouchy
when you're not fully charged.

02:23.625 --> 02:25.541
- Go power up and relax.
- [droid chirps]

02:32.458 --> 02:35.000
[Olly] That will be 1,600 credits.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.333
Keep the change, Olly.

02:40.041 --> 02:41.458
[Olly] See you next time.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.041
[console whirs]

03:34.750 --> 03:37.083
The Trandoshan's intel paid off.

03:37.166 --> 03:40.625
I tracked the pirate
and accessed her navicomputer.

03:40.708 --> 03:44.375
She tried to cover her tracks,
but I broke the encryption.

03:44.458 --> 03:45.666
<i>What did you find?</i>

03:45.750 --> 03:48.541
She frequented a planet in the Outer Rim.

03:48.625 --> 03:51.166
I'm headed there now to do recon.

03:51.250 --> 03:52.333
<i>Send the coordinates.</i>

03:52.416 --> 03:56.000
<i>I'll have a full division on standby
if you acquire a visual on the target.</i>

04:15.416 --> 04:17.708
That's gotta be all of it, right?

04:17.791 --> 04:19.666
We still need to grab the rations.

04:19.750 --> 04:21.541
Keep loading up the ship. We'll be back.

04:21.625 --> 04:24.541
[groans] Fine.

04:24.625 --> 04:28.291
But at least bring me back an ice cone.
No, no, no. M-Make it two.

04:29.375 --> 04:30.500
[Crosshair groans]

04:31.208 --> 04:33.208
[Gonky honks]

04:38.458 --> 04:39.916
[chuckles] Good to see you.

04:45.416 --> 04:47.000
[pants, coos]

04:49.125 --> 04:52.125
[chuckles] Good girl, Batcher.

04:54.458 --> 04:56.500
[villagers chattering, laughing]

05:00.708 --> 05:02.125
[panting]

05:02.208 --> 05:03.808
[Lyana] I wish you didn't have to leave.

05:04.583 --> 05:08.291
Me too, but Hunter thinks
it's safer for everyone if we do.

05:10.583 --> 05:11.823
What do you think of this spot?

05:12.541 --> 05:13.541
[Batcher panting]

05:13.625 --> 05:15.333
It's perfect.

05:15.416 --> 05:18.666
So, which treasures did you bring?

05:24.125 --> 05:25.125
[Omega sighs]

05:26.000 --> 05:29.041
You sure you wanna leave these behind?

05:30.916 --> 05:33.875
Pabu was the first place
that felt like a home.

05:36.500 --> 05:39.958
This way, a piece of us is still here.

05:43.541 --> 05:46.958
Well, I'll make sure these stay safe
until you come back.

05:47.666 --> 05:51.208
Because you will come back, right?

05:52.333 --> 05:53.541
I hope so.

05:56.208 --> 05:57.458

[grunts]

06:12.250 --> 06:13.250
[honks]

06:13.333 --> 06:16.250
I don't even think there's room
on this ship for all this gear.

06:16.333 --> 06:17.666
[honking]

06:17.750 --> 06:21.041
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe I should leave you behind.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.208
What is it?

07:26.208 --> 07:29.666
Not sure, but I don't like it.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.041
Omega, time to go.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
Copy.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.750
I've got eyes on the target.

08:10.833 --> 08:12.673
[Scorch] <i>Ground them</i>
<i>and wait for the division.</i>

08:12.750 --> 08:16.041
<i>She must be recovered unharmed.
No mistakes this time.</i>

08:16.125 --> 08:18.541
And the clones she is with?

08:18.625 --> 08:20.958
[Scorch] <i>If they get in your way,</i>
<i>eliminate them.</i>

08:26.916 --> 08:30.708
We're sorry to see you go,
but you're all welcome here anytime.

08:30.791 --> 08:32.375
Thanks for everything, Shep.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.125
I'll see you soon.

09:46.541 --> 09:49.458
[gasps] Wrecker? Wrecker!

09:50.833 --> 09:53.041
Mox and Stak, take Wrecker to Shep's.

09:53.125 --> 09:56.000
Deke, get AZI-3 to patch him up, and fast.

09:56.083 --> 09:57.416
On it.

09:57.500 --> 10:00.500
Ships don't just blow up.
We've been compromised.

10:04.541 --> 10:06.708
[rumbling]

10:15.875 --> 10:17.541
Everyone, get to cover!

10:17.625 --> 10:19.416

[clamoring]

10:37.958 --> 10:40.375
[crowd screaming]

10:48.291 --> 10:53.791
Cut off all escape routes.
Destroy any ships or sea skiffs in sight.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.000
Yes, sir.

11:12.416 --> 11:14.916
[crowd shouting, clamoring]

11:31.916 --> 11:35.833
This is all my fault.
They're attacking because of me.

11:35.916 --> 11:38.916
It's the Empire's fault. Not yours.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.833
You have to stay focused.

11:40.916 --> 11:42.876
[Crosshair] They're destroying
all means of escape

11:42.916 --> 11:44.250
and jamming our comms.

11:46.958 --> 11:49.208
We have to steal one of their gunships.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.250
Once we're out of range,
we can contact Echo.

11:51.333 --> 11:52.583
I'll handle it.

11:52.666 --> 11:55.916
You two, get to Shep's
and wait with Wrecker until I signal you.

11:57.916 --> 12:03.750
Lock down the town.
Search every domicile until you find her.

12:05.500 --> 12:06.740
What do you think you're doing?

12:06.791 --> 12:08.666
Who are you?

12:08.750 --> 12:10.791
The mayor of this town.

12:12.291 --> 12:15.083
You've opened fire on my village
and its people

12:15.166 --> 12:17.000
without warning and without reason.

12:17.083 --> 12:19.208
Under what pretense are you attacking?

12:19.291 --> 12:23.125
We are here to collect
a fugitive you've been harboring.

12:23.208 --> 12:26.916
- You can't just barge in here...
- I've barely done anything yet.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.291
You destroyed our docks
and fishing skiffs. Our livelihood.

12:31.375 --> 12:37.000
I have simply cut off her means of escape.
But I can do worse.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.416
I know the girl is here.

12:39.500 --> 12:44.666
Until she's turned over to me,
your island will burn.

13:07.791 --> 13:08.791
Batcher.

You can't do this! It's our home! [grunts]

13:18.500 --> 13:19.500
[stormtrooper 2] Get it!

13:20.000 --> 13:23.000
Batcher can handle herself. Let's go.

13:38.916 --> 13:39.916
[gasps] Lyana!

13:40.000 --> 13:43.791
Omega! My-My dad, he said to hide here.

13:44.916 --> 13:46.416
[sighs] I'm so scared.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.875
I know. I'm so sorry.

13:48.958 --> 13:51.500
Omega, I am relieved it is you.

13:51.583 --> 13:52.791
How's Wrecker, AZI?

13:52.875 --> 13:55.791
He is still unconscious,
but his vitals are stable.

13:55.875 --> 13:58.291
[Wrecker groaning]

14:07.916 --> 14:10.833
- [villager] You can't order us around...
- Where is your identification?

14:10.916 --> 14:13.083
- [grunts]
- [stormtrooper] Search the property.

Crosshair, is that Hunter?

15:25.291 --> 15:27.291
- [alarm continues]
- Uh-huh.

15:30.500 --> 15:33.375
My vessel's been compromised.
I can't shake him!

15:41.750 --> 15:43.000
[gasps]

15:46.041 --> 15:47.333
[grunts]

15:49.958 --> 15:51.791
Where is he? Do you see him?

15:56.625 --> 15:57.708
He's fine.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.083
[comms chatter]

16:00.708 --> 16:02.708
[sighs] Safer than we are at the moment.

16:05.875 --> 16:07.791
What do we do? Troopers will be here soon.

16:07.875 --> 16:10.791
Hunter would want us to stick to the plan.

16:10.875 --> 16:14.333
There's no hiding, Crosshair.
The Empire knows I'm here.

16:14.416 --> 16:16.708
They won't stop searching
until they find me.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.958
[sighs]

16:19.041 --> 16:21.958
Our only choice is to let them capture me.

16:22.041 --> 16:22.916
What?

16:23.000 --> 16:24.916
Look at what they've already done.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.958
I can't let the people here suffer more
because of me.

16:28.041 --> 16:29.916
You'll be taken back to Tantiss.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.625
Exactly.

16:31.708 --> 16:35.583
We've been trying to find
those coordinates, and nothing's worked.

16:35.666 --> 16:38.958
But if I keep my comm on me
and turn myself over,

16:39.041 --> 16:41.291
you can track me to Tantiss.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.625
This is our chance.

16:42.708 --> 16:45.541
Our chance to finally rescue the clones
imprisoned there.

16:45.625 --> 16:49.208
No. They'll search you and find it.
It won't work.

16:49.291 --> 16:52.708
Well, then shoot a secondary tracker
onto the ship that they take me away on.

16:52.791 --> 16:56.791
Too many unknown variables.
It's not a viable plan.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.250
It's all we've got.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.416
And it's my choice.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.625
Omega.

17:02.708 --> 17:05.208
Focus on the bigger mission, Crosshair.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.791
I'm just a small part of it.

17:28.916 --> 17:30.416
Stop.

17:31.833 --> 17:33.791
I surrender.

17:34.625 --> 17:36.000
Stay alert.

17:36.083 --> 17:40.583
I neutralized the other two clones
with her, but not the third.

17:49.958 --> 17:55.500
Take me and leave the island alone.
The people here are innocent.

18:01.625 --> 18:05.125
Then you never should have come here
in the first place.

18:06.333 --> 18:08.833
Scan her for tracking devices.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.958
[beeping]

18:13.041 --> 18:14.041
[chimes]

18:16.666 --> 18:18.208

Fine.
