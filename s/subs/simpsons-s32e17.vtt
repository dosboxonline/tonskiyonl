WEBVTT

00:07.031 --> 00:09.157
(humming)

00:09.326 --> 00:10.509
(explosion)

00:10.736 --> 00:13.846
Oh, my hallway-walking God!

00:14.073 --> 00:16.256
I've seen my fair share
of workplace atrocities,

00:16.392 --> 00:18.833
but this one's gonna be hard
not to whistle-blow.

00:18.927 --> 00:20.835
Uh, Carlson,
how about you forget

00:20.929 --> 00:23.838
any unkillable
irradiated airborne entities

00:24.007 --> 00:25.582
you<i> think</i> you saw

00:25.675 --> 00:28.009
and sign
this nondisclosure agreement?

00:28.103 --> 00:31.846
I'm sorry, I have no choice
but to speak up and say...

00:31.940 --> 00:33.848
what's in it for me?

00:33.942 --> 00:36.035
Guess who just got
two VIP concert tickets

00:36.262 --> 00:38.186
to see Bob Seger tonight!

00:38.355 --> 00:39.705
Bob Seger!

00:39.932 --> 00:41.765
Which Bullet Band
is he bringing?

00:41.858 --> 00:43.024
Silver!

00:43.118 --> 00:46.119
In that case,
I'm closin' shop early.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.789
(humming)

00:48.883 --> 00:51.958
Marge, you know how nothing
ever happens to me?

00:52.127 --> 00:55.112
Well, the curse has been lifted!

00:55.205 --> 00:57.447
Oh. I love how excited you are

00:57.541 --> 00:59.892
to chaperone
the kids' weekend sleepover

01:00.043 --> 01:02.135
on the World War II battleship.

01:02.229 --> 01:04.063
What?! Chaperoning?

01:04.214 --> 01:06.807
You can't just spring this on me
at the last...

01:06.975 --> 01:10.644
(yelping)

01:10.813 --> 01:12.145
D'oh!

01:12.314 --> 01:14.573
Aw, you've got to fill in
for me, Marge.

01:14.724 --> 01:16.909
I'd do it for you
if you were the husband.

01:17.136 --> 01:18.744
You always get to do
the fun thing

01:18.895 --> 01:20.412
and leave me holding the bag.

01:20.639 --> 01:22.414
I'll get you a new bag.
A tote from the merch table.

01:22.641 --> 01:23.990
What size are you?

01:24.159 --> 01:28.921
No. I'm watching the Gen Gala
red-carpet arrivals tomorrow.

01:29.148 --> 01:31.498
Can't you just record it
and watch it next week

01:31.592 --> 01:34.093
when me and Lenny are
at the Hall & Oates concert?

01:34.261 --> 01:36.744
Oh! I'm hosting the watch party.

01:36.839 --> 01:41.100
I have firm commitments
from several A-level gays.

01:41.268 --> 01:42.917
We're all gonna make
snarky comments

01:42.937 --> 01:45.604
about celebrities'
outrageous outfits.

01:45.831 --> 01:49.108
I'm working up the courage
to use the B-word on a man.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.276
Okay, honey, I give up.

01:51.503 --> 01:53.003
You host your party.
I go to the concert.

01:53.096 --> 01:55.021
No field trip for the kids.

01:55.116 --> 01:57.174
It was your decision,
so I'll let you tell them.

01:57.267 --> 01:59.192
♪<i> Yo-ho, yo-ho</i> ♪

01:59.286 --> 02:01.912
♪<i> A field trip life for me.</i> ♪

02:04.199 --> 02:06.366
(sighs)

02:06.460 --> 02:07.701
(horn blares)

02:07.795 --> 02:09.128
-Whoa!
-Whoa.

02:09.355 --> 02:10.629
Mommy! Mommy!

02:10.856 --> 02:14.133
I took a bite of my juice box
because I forgot!

02:14.360 --> 02:16.026
Ready about, sailors!

02:16.195 --> 02:18.545
Name's Captain Bowditch.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.955
For the next 36 hours,
you will be my crew

02:20.975 --> 02:24.217
aboard the USS ship with a name
we're not allowed to say anymore

02:24.311 --> 02:26.052
and with good reason.

02:26.147 --> 02:29.297
Now, the year is 1943.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.726
We sailors have fought many
battles in the Pacific theater,

02:32.820 --> 02:35.654
but today we face
our most vicious enemy yet:

02:35.839 --> 02:37.305
oxidation.

02:37.399 --> 02:38.806
(booing)

02:38.901 --> 02:40.826
Kill those lousy Oxies!

02:41.011 --> 02:44.721
Rust has overtaken the vessel,
and I'm giving you three tools

02:44.890 --> 02:47.815
to neutralize the threat:
wire brushes, marine paint,

02:47.910 --> 02:49.726
and the remainder
of the weekend.

02:49.819 --> 02:51.061
(shouting excitedly)

02:51.230 --> 02:54.506
Chaperones, you will stand watch
in six-hour shifts.

02:54.733 --> 02:56.175
Now, pair up!

02:57.494 --> 02:59.678
Can you imagine getting stuck
with Sarah Wiggum

02:59.905 --> 03:01.254
for the whole weekend?

03:01.407 --> 03:03.665
What's she looking for,
a personality?

03:03.833 --> 03:05.833
(quiet laughter)

03:05.928 --> 03:09.504
So, I guess we should figure out
some system to pair up, like...

03:09.598 --> 03:10.898
Oh.

03:14.269 --> 03:15.694
(sighs)

03:15.921 --> 03:17.437
Hey, Sarah, we've met before.

03:17.589 --> 03:19.514
I'm Bart's mom, Marge.

03:19.683 --> 03:21.349
Hi.

03:21.518 --> 03:22.868
(sighs)

03:23.095 --> 03:27.748
So, overnight field trips--
the things we do for our kids.

03:29.359 --> 03:31.268
Kids.

03:31.361 --> 03:32.527
So...

03:32.621 --> 03:35.130
have you ever been
on a battleship before?

03:36.658 --> 03:38.091
Probably.

03:42.965 --> 03:44.872
We're so close,
we can read the labels

03:44.925 --> 03:47.133
on the drummer's medications.

03:47.228 --> 03:48.802
Hey, I have that, too.

03:48.896 --> 03:52.064
Mild depression rules!

03:52.215 --> 03:54.066
Eh, nice seats, huh, fellas?

03:54.235 --> 03:56.735
Yeah, Mr. Burns' payoffs
are always the best.

03:56.962 --> 03:59.905
Luckily, I was able to get
my wife to take over chaperoning

04:00.056 --> 04:03.650
some stupid battleship weekend
with Ralphie.

04:03.819 --> 04:05.652
Hey, I saddled my wife
with that, too.

04:05.821 --> 04:07.654
Marge and Sarah
were okay with that?

04:07.748 --> 04:09.414
Ah, they'll be fine.

04:09.566 --> 04:12.325
Wives, they love
that World War II stuff.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.569
(chuckles):
Yeah, they're always gifting
their husbands

04:14.588 --> 04:16.404
books and movies about it,

04:16.498 --> 04:19.816
but you know they're really
buying it them for themselves.

04:19.835 --> 04:21.093
Hmm.

04:21.262 --> 04:23.820
And number ten would be...

04:23.839 --> 04:27.415
oh, "telling a funny story."

04:27.584 --> 04:30.660
What are<i> your</i> top ten ways
of starting a conversation?

04:30.679 --> 04:32.104
Talking.

04:32.331 --> 04:33.939
(sighs)

04:34.166 --> 04:35.999
I guess we should get back
to the kids.

04:36.092 --> 04:37.425
They're asleep.

04:37.519 --> 04:38.777
What?

04:41.448 --> 04:44.700
Almost midnight?
How did it get so late?

04:45.953 --> 04:48.996
Oh. It's only 8:50?

04:51.608 --> 04:55.352
Wait. Did you move
the clock ahead

04:55.445 --> 04:58.038
to trick the kids
into going to sleep early?

04:58.132 --> 05:00.448
Sarah, I'm impressed.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.858
(gasps)
Ooh.

05:02.027 --> 05:05.095
A bottle of pocket alcohol.

05:06.198 --> 05:07.622
(exhales):
Ah...

05:07.791 --> 05:10.124
Dang, this is the last place
on earth I want to be.

05:10.144 --> 05:14.888
No offense, Marge, but, geez,
this field trip<i> sucks!</i>

05:14.982 --> 05:18.708
(gasps)
You said all those words!

05:18.802 --> 05:20.468
I'm just quiet.

05:20.562 --> 05:22.896
Even though everyone thinks
I'm an idiot.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.139
No, no, we don't think
you're an idiot.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.141
We just think you're boring.

05:27.161 --> 05:29.143
(gasps)
Oops.

05:29.163 --> 05:31.221
(laughter)

05:31.390 --> 05:33.223
Did you bring this from home?

05:33.392 --> 05:36.743
Actually, I got it from Admiral
Dingdong's liquor cabinet.

05:36.912 --> 05:39.913
-It wasn't locked?
-Oh, maybe it was.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.065
Uh, wink.

05:42.158 --> 05:43.658
MARGE:
Ooh.

05:43.827 --> 05:45.802
I've never done a swig.

05:46.830 --> 05:47.846
Whoa!

05:48.073 --> 05:50.090
(laughter)

05:50.242 --> 05:54.001
Oh, Sarah Wiggum, who<i> are</i> you?

05:54.170 --> 05:58.005
I love Clancy, but you have
no idea what it's like

05:58.100 --> 06:00.859
to be married to a man
with a dangerous job

06:01.086 --> 06:03.195
he's just not good at.

06:03.422 --> 06:04.437
Actually...

06:04.573 --> 06:06.439
And with the way he eats,

06:06.533 --> 06:08.441
each crust
he sucks the cheese out of

06:08.535 --> 06:10.351
could be his last.

06:10.445 --> 06:12.445
Maybe I do understand.

06:12.539 --> 06:16.433
It just takes so much work
to be a mom and a wife

06:16.526 --> 06:18.768
<i> and</i> keep the goods
in a tight little package,

06:18.862 --> 06:20.194
if you catch my drift.

06:20.363 --> 06:22.196
Sometimes it feels like he...

06:22.290 --> 06:23.489
Takes me for granted!

06:23.625 --> 06:26.459
Why do his last-minute man-plans
have to ruin

06:26.628 --> 06:29.796
the one day of the year
where I get to be catty?

06:29.965 --> 06:31.131
(chuckles):
Hell yeah, sister.

06:31.299 --> 06:33.617
Well, you know what?
You and me,

06:33.785 --> 06:36.636
we're like two fun peas
in a party pod.

06:36.805 --> 06:38.805
We should do more hangouts.

06:38.974 --> 06:42.809
Oh, I'd like that, but there's
a reason I keep to myself.

06:42.978 --> 06:43.977
Ooh.

06:44.146 --> 06:46.154
(singsongy):
Secret reasons.

06:47.299 --> 06:49.241
(gasps) Oh, no.

06:49.468 --> 06:51.301
What are you doing here?

06:51.394 --> 06:53.412
How did you find me?

06:53.639 --> 06:54.654
Sarah!

06:54.748 --> 06:56.289
Marge!

07:02.571 --> 07:04.589
<i> MARGE:</i>
<i> Please take this bag</i>
<i> off my head.</i>

07:04.816 --> 07:05.790
I think whoever you kidnapped

07:05.926 --> 07:08.385
before me was a smoker. Ugh!

07:09.596 --> 07:11.337
Why did you bring her into it?

07:11.506 --> 07:13.265
She's just
some vanilla soccer mom.

07:13.434 --> 07:14.933
She doesn't know anything.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.562
Hey, once I start bagging heads,
I can't stop.

07:19.923 --> 07:21.440
Hey, there, Sarah.
I see you're hanging

07:21.667 --> 07:23.166
with the Yankee Candle crowd.

07:23.259 --> 07:25.277
Wait. Y-You know these people?

07:25.446 --> 07:27.595
Marge, meet Bette and Erin.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.614
They're my old partners.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.617
In a throuple?
Who are the original two?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.435
Partners in crime.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.680
You're a criminal?

07:36.773 --> 07:38.540
Jeebus Crackers!

07:40.627 --> 07:41.626
Hi, Mr. Seger.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.353
Boy, you probably
don't remember this,

07:43.522 --> 07:45.130
but I saw you
at an airport once,

07:45.299 --> 07:47.524
and I was too nervous
to say anything,

07:47.693 --> 07:49.526
and then it wasn't you.

07:49.695 --> 07:51.544
We love you, man!
We promised our wives

07:51.697 --> 07:54.030
we'd go on some
dumb school field trip,

07:54.123 --> 07:57.434
but when we got these tickets,
we ditched them so fast.

07:58.537 --> 07:59.886
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:00.038 --> 08:02.129
You broke a promise
to your wives?

08:02.298 --> 08:05.150
A good husband's supposed to be
"Like a Rock."

08:05.301 --> 08:07.635
Because we're all running
"Against the Wind."

08:07.654 --> 08:09.637
Terrible "Night Moves."

08:09.656 --> 08:10.805
Look at this.

08:10.974 --> 08:12.473
Those aren't tour dates.

08:12.493 --> 08:15.577
They're all the times I've
kept commitments to my wife.

08:17.723 --> 08:19.239
"Rock and Roll Never Forgets"

08:19.391 --> 08:22.225
the needs
of his coequal life companion.

08:22.394 --> 08:24.485
You sicken me.

08:24.654 --> 08:27.413
Were... were we
just Seger-shamed?

08:27.566 --> 08:29.824
Why, the real silver bullet
is truth.

08:29.993 --> 08:31.676
We're terrible husbands.

08:31.828 --> 08:34.328
I never should have left Marge
holding the bag.

08:34.497 --> 08:36.998
We've got to go make it up
to Bob Seger.

08:37.166 --> 08:39.226
And our wives.

08:40.595 --> 08:42.746
Sarah, you were a crook?

08:42.764 --> 08:44.597
Everything I never knew
or cared to wonder about you

08:44.766 --> 08:46.599
has been a lie.

08:46.768 --> 08:49.361
We weren't crooks.
We were thieves.

Hey there, blue boy.

09:33.965 --> 09:36.466
I was walking
past your<i> big building</i>

09:36.484 --> 09:38.410
and seemed
to have sprained my ankle

09:38.579 --> 09:40.579
because of my high flops.

09:40.730 --> 09:42.155
Do you happen to have...

09:42.324 --> 09:44.157
-What, a girlfriend?
-...an icepack?

09:44.326 --> 09:45.250
(both laughing)

09:45.419 --> 09:46.810
I'm sorry. I'm s...

09:46.828 --> 09:48.311
Of course, of course I do.

09:48.330 --> 09:50.589
Uh, this is just my night job,
by the way.

09:50.816 --> 09:53.425
I'm, uh, putting myself through
the police academy. Yeah.

09:53.594 --> 09:56.653
-Isn't that free?
-Well, the first time, yeah.

09:56.671 --> 09:59.598
I love a man
in a rented uniform.

10:07.423 --> 10:10.108
<i> The kiss was part of the plan.</i>

10:10.277 --> 10:13.169
<i> But falling</i>
<i> head over high flops wasn't.</i>

10:13.262 --> 10:15.171
Clancy...

10:15.264 --> 10:17.449
(siren wailing)

10:17.618 --> 10:20.118
-(gasps) Oh, no.
-No, no, don't leave.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.454
Come back to pile.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.180
Uh, I gotta go, blue boy.

10:24.199 --> 10:26.516
-I'm sorry.
-Ah, no problem.

10:26.685 --> 10:29.461
-Oh, um, will you marry me?
-Probably!

10:29.630 --> 10:30.945
(gasps)

10:30.964 --> 10:32.856
<i> I was supposed to be</i>
<i> the getaway driver.</i>

10:32.874 --> 10:34.691
<i> My best friends were arrested.</i>

10:34.784 --> 10:36.376
And it was all my fault.

10:36.544 --> 10:38.361
Oh, cool your jets.

10:38.530 --> 10:40.029
Yeah, hot jets.

10:40.198 --> 10:42.623
<i> ERIN:</i>
<i> It wasn't your fault</i>
<i> we got busted.</i>

10:42.643 --> 10:44.884
<i> We were set up...</i>

10:45.036 --> 10:46.645
<i> by Red.</i>

10:47.797 --> 10:49.389
(alarm blaring)

10:49.541 --> 10:51.541
(gasping)

10:51.710 --> 10:53.801
She got away
with our whole take,

10:53.820 --> 10:55.803
including
the Hourglass Diamond.

10:55.972 --> 10:58.381
That backstabbing
sack of Spanx.

10:58.550 --> 11:01.493
Wait, so it wasn't my fault
you got caught.

11:01.662 --> 11:05.221
Yeah, and if you hadn't gone all
horndog on that rent-a-cop,

11:05.240 --> 11:06.814
you'd have been locked up, too.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.149
We found Red.

11:08.317 --> 11:10.818
She goes by the name
Lindsey Naegle now.

11:10.987 --> 11:12.745
I've heard of her.

11:12.898 --> 11:16.007
She works in various female
executive positions around town.

11:16.159 --> 11:19.160
We've got a plan to steal
that diamond back from her,

11:19.328 --> 11:21.437
and you're gonna help us.

11:21.497 --> 11:23.589
No, I left that life
behind me.

11:23.758 --> 11:25.183
I have a husband now,

11:25.334 --> 11:28.169
and a son who's smart in a way
we haven't figured out yet.

11:28.337 --> 11:31.672
Well, it'd be a real shame
if the Chief of Police

11:31.766 --> 11:34.025
found out his wife was
a common criminal.

11:34.252 --> 11:36.343
(gasps)
You never told Clancy?

11:36.512 --> 11:38.438
Let's just say
he's always been better

11:38.590 --> 11:40.606
at planting evidence
than finding it.

11:40.775 --> 11:43.868
Why don't I just call him now
and tell him everything?

11:45.597 --> 11:46.788
I'm in.

11:49.267 --> 11:50.709
Our wives are missing?

11:50.860 --> 11:52.377
Not unheard of.

11:52.528 --> 11:54.879
Most women have such
an idealized version

11:55.031 --> 11:56.956
of the Second World War
in their heads

11:57.125 --> 11:59.050
that when they meet
the cold, hard reality,

11:59.202 --> 12:00.385
they can't face it.

12:00.536 --> 12:01.886
Did you see what happened?

12:02.055 --> 12:03.963
There was but one witness.

12:04.132 --> 12:07.708
Junior Seaman Ralph,
give your account of the watch.

12:07.728 --> 12:11.563
The mommies got new face hats,
then got into a slidey-door car.

12:11.714 --> 12:13.398
(chuckles)
Don't worry, I speak Ralph.

12:13.567 --> 12:16.292
Face hats?
Slidey-door? (gasps)

12:16.311 --> 12:17.977
God, they were kidnapped!

12:18.146 --> 12:21.314
-(gasps)
-And there's only one man
bold enough

12:21.483 --> 12:24.075
to kidnap the wives
of the chief of police

12:24.302 --> 12:26.411
and his slightly slimmer
acquaintance.

12:26.562 --> 12:28.246
Sarah was kidnapped?

12:28.397 --> 12:31.307
Oh, spare me the act.
We know it was you.

12:31.326 --> 12:33.326
I spare, I swear.

12:33.495 --> 12:36.145
I need your family
to be happy and healthy,

12:36.164 --> 12:38.923
because who else would I say
it would be a shame

12:39.092 --> 12:41.593
if something were to happen to?

12:41.820 --> 12:44.429
Okay, but what about
one of your cronies?

12:44.656 --> 12:47.098
I assure you,
you are a beloved figure

12:47.267 --> 12:49.267
amongst my business brethren.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.160
CLANCY:
Mm.

12:51.254 --> 12:54.998
(whispers):
You look a lot like
that guy Chief Bungles.

12:55.166 --> 12:58.276
But there's no other reason
to kidnap Sarah.

12:58.445 --> 13:00.336
She's just
my little schmoop-a-doop,

13:00.355 --> 13:02.113
and that's all there is to her.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.783
Apparently not. (laughs)

13:04.951 --> 13:07.285
Perhaps your wives
were not kidnapped.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.955
Perhaps they left
because you are selfish men.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.349
That's the only explanation.

13:13.442 --> 13:15.960
It was all about us.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.004
All right, what's the job?

13:19.282 --> 13:21.190
Naegle sold the jewels
she ripped off from us

13:21.359 --> 13:23.192
and became a fancy socialite.

13:23.361 --> 13:24.803
She kept the biggest rock
for herself.

13:24.971 --> 13:28.431
The Hourglass Diamond--
it's in her tiara.

13:29.792 --> 13:32.035
And we're gonna steal it back

13:32.128 --> 13:34.704
when she wears it
to the Gen Gala, tomorrow.

13:34.797 --> 13:38.465
You're gonna rob the Gen Gala?

13:38.485 --> 13:41.569
Sorry, sorry. Scheme away.

13:42.881 --> 13:44.989
Okay,
here's how it's gonna work.

13:45.141 --> 13:47.550
First, we come up
through this manhole.

13:47.719 --> 13:48.885
Nope!

13:49.054 --> 13:50.311
Excuse you?

13:50.479 --> 13:52.722
Look, I may not know anything
about heists,

13:52.891 --> 13:56.576
but I am the world's biggest
superfan of the Gen Gala,

13:56.728 --> 13:58.152
and your plan won't work.

13:58.321 --> 13:59.153
And why not?

13:59.322 --> 14:01.506
If you did any research,

14:01.657 --> 14:03.824
you'd know Beyoncé's
going to be carried in

14:03.993 --> 14:06.327
by 20 plus-size gladiators,

14:06.495 --> 14:08.329
who will form
a human pyramid

14:08.497 --> 14:10.256
right on top of your way in.

14:10.408 --> 14:11.424
No heist.

14:11.593 --> 14:12.851
If you're so Kmart smart,

14:13.002 --> 14:14.335
how would you get in?

14:14.503 --> 14:17.522
Well, these entrances
will be blocked by fans,

14:17.691 --> 14:19.673
press and authorized stalkers.

14:19.842 --> 14:22.843
The best plan would be
to put on a crazy dress

14:23.012 --> 14:24.937
and sneak in
through the red carpet.

14:25.106 --> 14:28.107
Although, you wouldn't get
far without a publicist

14:28.201 --> 14:30.201
who knows everything
about the gala.

14:30.353 --> 14:33.446
-Someone like you?
-Yeah.

14:33.615 --> 14:36.949
This vanilla soccer mom
could be our secret weapon.

14:37.118 --> 14:38.951
Me? Join the robbery?

14:39.120 --> 14:40.861
(scoffs)
No way!

14:41.030 --> 14:43.956
Stealing is one of
the big "thou shalt nots."

14:44.125 --> 14:45.458
It's not about the cash.

14:45.627 --> 14:47.126
It's about setting things right.

14:47.295 --> 14:50.446
Lindsey Naegle betrayed us
for money and fame,

14:50.615 --> 14:53.725
and all we got
are bad prison tattoos.

14:53.876 --> 14:55.968
MARGE:
Aw, duckies!

14:56.062 --> 14:57.637
Marge, aren't you tired

14:57.805 --> 14:59.972
of being underestimated
and overlooked?

15:00.066 --> 15:01.900
Together,
we can right a wrong

15:02.051 --> 15:03.976
and look damn good doing it.

15:04.145 --> 15:06.529
I've always wanted
to say this...

-Probably?
-ALL: Ah...

Ah, that's the good shade.

15:52.527 --> 15:55.102
The plan's working.
We look amazing.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.330

the other girls in?

Oh, my God!

Rihanna! (gasps)

16:31.049 --> 16:34.409
I listen to the clean versions
of all your songs!

16:36.645 --> 16:40.248
Now, let's see if there's
any honey left in this pot.

16:41.984 --> 16:44.818
Excuse me, I seemed
to have a pulled a muscle.

16:44.912 --> 16:48.064
Do you have an ice pack
so that my leg can stop...

16:48.233 --> 16:50.157
-quivering?
-(gulps)

16:50.251 --> 16:51.676
Right away, ma'am.

16:51.845 --> 16:54.220
Oh-ho, hot stuff.

17:04.932 --> 17:06.599
Ugh, no sign of our wives.

17:06.693 --> 17:08.768
We checked out all their
favorite places,

17:08.936 --> 17:11.103
but turns out
we don't pay enough attention

17:11.256 --> 17:12.588
to know what those are.

17:12.607 --> 17:14.106
So I don't know what we did.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.184
It was my distinct pleasure
to watch your son.

17:17.353 --> 17:19.520
I find we are quite simpatico.

17:19.688 --> 17:23.124
Both of us know nothin'
about nothin'.

17:24.786 --> 17:25.526
JOHNNY TIGHTLIPS:
Oh!

17:25.694 --> 17:27.953
Now that's a fluid gender!

17:28.048 --> 17:31.716
I wouldn't mind asking them
their preferred pronouns. Oh!

17:31.867 --> 17:34.443
(gasps)
If I'm not mistaken,

17:34.462 --> 17:37.780
that's how Marge looks
when she's happy.

17:37.799 --> 17:39.131
And that's my Sarah!

17:39.300 --> 17:40.725
Come on, Homer.

17:40.876 --> 17:44.145
It looks like this
town's got a museum.

17:50.311 --> 17:52.528
There's Lindsey,
and she's wearing the tiara.

17:57.560 --> 17:59.077
Okay, don't be nervous.

17:59.228 --> 18:01.637
-You can do this.
-Nervous?

18:01.806 --> 18:04.624
This is the best field trip
of my fricking life!

18:05.827 --> 18:09.312
Ms. Naegle,
can I just say, "that dress."

18:09.330 --> 18:12.315
I know, right?
You go, girl. (chuckles)

18:12.333 --> 18:14.258
What setting would you even
wash that on?

18:14.427 --> 18:16.319
Delicate? Eco-warm?

18:16.337 --> 18:19.430
I bet it would make so much
noise in the dryer, right?

18:21.267 --> 18:23.826
Um, I don't want this
to sound harsh,

18:23.845 --> 18:26.329
but you're not famous,
so you don't exist.

18:26.497 --> 18:27.496
Bye now.

18:27.515 --> 18:30.333
Darling,
stop talking to that empty chair

18:30.426 --> 18:33.069
and come take a selfie
at the Fenty lip gloss fountain.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.077
Oh, it's a fake!

18:42.847 --> 18:44.104
I've been robbed!

18:44.124 --> 18:46.940
Somebody stop
those two nobodies!

18:46.960 --> 18:47.959
Keep it cool.

18:48.128 --> 18:49.127
We just have to slip
out of here

 FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY

20:48.414 --> 20:51.290
 And FORD.
 We go further, so you can.

20:57.256 --> 20:58.923
Oh, Clancy.

20:59.166 --> 21:02.818
So, this whole time, I've been
married to a master criminal.

21:02.837 --> 21:04.595
Damn straight.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.764
(both moaning)

21:08.192 --> 21:10.559
Wait, wait, uh, where's Ralph?

21:12.013 --> 21:14.013
I must confess,

21:14.165 --> 21:15.664
I thought putting
crushed-up Oreos

21:15.833 --> 21:18.425
into the cookies and cream
yogurt would be redundant.

21:18.444 --> 21:22.187
Instead, it is transcendent.

21:22.340 --> 21:25.174
(chuckles) I like to smoosh
the gummy bears.

21:25.267 --> 21:26.951
Hey, no touching!

21:27.102 --> 21:31.680
If the boy wants to smoosh,
the boy will smoosh.

21:31.849 --> 21:33.849
I love you, scary daddy.

21:34.018 --> 21:37.962
I love you too,
Ralphie "Stickie Hands."

21:41.450 --> 21:42.967
Shh!
