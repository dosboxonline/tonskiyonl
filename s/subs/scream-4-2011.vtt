WEBVTT

00:05.896 --> 00:14.028
(telephone ringing)

00:14.905 --> 00:17.031
- Hello?
- (Ghostface) Hello.

00:17.116 --> 00:19.742
- Uh, yes?
- Who is this?

00:19.827 --> 00:22.453
- Who are you calling?
- Who am I speaking to?

00:22.538 --> 00:24.163
(scoffs) Wrong number.
(beep)

00:24.248 --> 00:26.541
- Who was that?
- Oh, nobody.

00:26.625 --> 00:29.710
- Did you pick a movie?
- Yeah. We're gonna go scary.

00:29.795 --> 00:32.505
- "Saw 4."
- Ugh. I saw that in theaters.

00:32.589 --> 00:34.715
It sucks.
It's not scary, it's gross.

00:34.800 --> 00:36.634
I hate all that torture-porn shit.

00:36.718 --> 00:39.303
(chuckles)
How do you really feel?

00:39.388 --> 00:43.558
Well, I like Jigsaw.
I think he kills people very creatively.

00:43.642 --> 00:47.019
But you don't give a shit who dies
'cause there's no character development.

00:47.104 --> 00:49.897
There's just body parts ripping
and blood spewing. Blah.

00:49.982 --> 00:52.859
- Who do you keep texting?
- I have a Facebook stalker.

00:52.943 --> 00:55.903
- He keeps leaving me messages.
- Yeah, like what?

00:55.988 --> 00:59.907
Just stuff. Like, "Hey, what's up?
You're hot. I wanna kill you."

00:59.992 --> 01:01.701
So delete him.

01:01.785 --> 01:04.287
I did,
but he hacked his way back in.

01:04.370 --> 01:06.622
So report him.

01:06.707 --> 01:11.043
He's really hot, though.
You wanna see?

01:14.673 --> 01:16.424
That's Channing Tatum.

01:16.508 --> 01:18.593
It is not.
Is it?

01:18.677 --> 01:22.471
Yeah, from his Abercrombie days.
You are being punked.

01:22.556 --> 01:24.640
(telephone rings)

01:29.229 --> 01:31.397
- Hello?
- (Ghostface) Who is this?

01:31.481 --> 01:34.692
The more impatient version
of the person you just spoke to.

01:34.776 --> 01:37.612
I'm sorry.
You don't have to be a bitch about it.

01:37.696 --> 01:39.155
No, of course I don't.
Eat me.

01:39.239 --> 01:42.325
You hang up on me and I'll cut through
your neck until I feel bone!

01:42.409 --> 01:45.203
- Who is it?
- It's for you.

01:47.372 --> 01:49.999
- Hello?
- Who's this?

01:50.083 --> 01:52.168
It's Trudie.
Who's this?

01:52.252 --> 01:55.880
This is the last person
you're ever gonna see alive.

01:55.964 --> 01:57.131
It's a prank. Hang up.

01:57.216 --> 01:59.717
(beep)
Why'd you hand the phone to me?

01:59.801 --> 02:03.137
You're the one with the stalker.
Are the doors locked?

02:03.222 --> 02:05.306
Don't freak out.

02:05.390 --> 02:08.935
(telephone rings)

02:09.019 --> 02:13.022
Let it ring.

02:13.106 --> 02:15.107
(beep)

02:15.192 --> 02:18.069
(cell phone vibrates)

02:18.153 --> 02:20.738
It's from stalker boy.

02:20.822 --> 02:22.573
He said, "Answer the phone."

02:22.658 --> 02:25.243
(sighs) For God's sake.
It's a joke, Trudie.

02:25.327 --> 02:27.787
It's probably Lexi or Karen.
Where are you going?

02:27.871 --> 02:30.331
To make sure
the front door is locked.

02:30.415 --> 02:32.500
(doorbell rings, both scream)

02:32.584 --> 02:34.126
No. Don't open it.

02:34.211 --> 02:37.880
You're overreacting.
(scoffs)

02:37.965 --> 02:41.759
It's a joke, Trudie, okay?
Somebody made a dummy profile.

02:41.843 --> 02:44.011
- They're just trying to scare you.
- Wait.

02:44.096 --> 02:46.347
(loudly) Who is it?

02:46.431 --> 02:49.308
I said, who is it?

02:49.393 --> 02:51.602
Let's call the cops.

02:51.687 --> 02:54.355
(cell phone vibrates)

02:54.439 --> 02:57.650
"I dare you to open the door."

02:57.734 --> 02:59.360
No, Sherrie. Don't.

02:59.444 --> 03:01.153
No, don't, I'm scared.

03:01.238 --> 03:03.614
Hey,
it could be anyone that we know.

03:03.699 --> 03:05.700
Lisa, Bailey, Wayne,

03:05.784 --> 03:08.452
or the hopeful long shot,
Channing Tatum.

03:25.595 --> 03:28.556
- There's nobody out here.
- (sighs softly)

03:28.640 --> 03:31.976
(cell phone vibrates)

03:32.060 --> 03:33.352
What does it say?

03:33.437 --> 03:38.566
It says, "I'm not outside.
I'm right beside you."

03:38.650 --> 03:41.569
(screams) Trudie!

03:41.653 --> 03:43.863
Trudie... oh, my God.

03:43.947 --> 03:45.197
(screams)

03:45.282 --> 03:47.992
(gasping)

03:55.834 --> 03:59.170
(woman screams)

04:01.465 --> 04:03.591
Fucking kidding me?

04:03.675 --> 04:04.967
What?

04:05.052 --> 04:07.386
That was so fucking stupid.
Pure horseshit.

04:07.471 --> 04:09.889
The death of horror
right here in front of us.

04:09.973 --> 04:11.349
I jumped.
Scared me.

04:11.433 --> 04:14.894
A fucking Facebook killer?
You're kidding me, right?

04:14.978 --> 04:18.647
I guess now it would be Twitter.
That'd make more sense.

04:18.732 --> 04:22.360
A bunch of articulate teens sit around
and deconstruct horror movies

04:22.444 --> 04:24.945
until Ghostface kills them one by one?

04:25.030 --> 04:26.739
It's been done to death,

04:26.823 --> 04:29.950
the whole self-aware,
post-modern meta shit.

04:30.035 --> 04:33.120
Stick a fork in 1996 already.

04:33.205 --> 04:36.665
I like the "Stab" movies.
They're scarier.

04:36.750 --> 04:39.960
It's not aliens or zombies
or little Asian ghost girls.

04:40.045 --> 04:44.382
There's something real about a guy
with a knife who just...

04:44.466 --> 04:47.426
snaps.

04:47.511 --> 04:49.553
It could really happen.

04:49.638 --> 04:53.349
I can't do it.
These sequels don't know when to stop.

04:53.433 --> 04:55.935
They just keep recycling
the same shit.

04:56.019 --> 04:57.478
Even the opening scene.

04:57.562 --> 04:59.438
There's always some random girl
who gets a call

04:59.523 --> 05:01.065
that undoubtedly ends up
getting her killed.

05:01.149 --> 05:03.609
It's all so predictable.
There's no element of surprise.

05:03.693 --> 05:06.278
You can see everything coming!

05:06.363 --> 05:08.030
Aah! (gasps softly)

05:10.909 --> 05:13.411
- (gasps)
- Did that surprise you?

05:15.789 --> 05:17.581
It's your own fault.

05:17.666 --> 05:19.333
Why?

05:19.418 --> 05:21.877
- Because you talk too much.
- Agh!

05:21.962 --> 05:25.965
Now shut the fuck up
and watch the movie.

05:30.804 --> 05:31.887
(chokes wetly)

05:31.972 --> 05:33.556
(woman screams)

05:33.640 --> 05:35.766
Oh, my God, I love it.

05:35.851 --> 05:38.769
I've seen it five times,
and it still gets me every time.

05:38.854 --> 05:41.522
You're kidding.
I don't get it.

05:43.233 --> 05:44.316
(TV shuts off)

05:44.401 --> 05:47.069
Okay.
It's like "The Twilight Zone."

05:47.154 --> 05:49.238
"Twilight Zone"?
A movie within a movie.

05:49.322 --> 05:50.823
I get that.
But it's illogical.

05:50.907 --> 05:53.659
It begs the question that if the
beginning of "Stab 7" is "Stab 6,"

05:53.743 --> 05:56.036
then is the beginning
of "Stab 6" "Stab 5"?

05:56.121 --> 05:57.746
And, if so,
what is "Stab 4" about?

05:57.831 --> 06:00.207
- You're over-thinking it.
- Am I?

06:00.292 --> 06:01.917
Or did whoever make it
just under-think it?

06:02.002 --> 06:04.044
There's a reason
I don't watch these movies.

06:04.129 --> 06:07.465
I can't believe you haven't seen them.
We live in Woodsboro.

06:07.549 --> 06:09.925
That has nothing to do
with Woodsboro.

06:10.010 --> 06:12.928
I-I thought you said "Stab"
was based on true stories.

06:13.013 --> 06:16.015
The first three, the original trilogy,
is based off of Sidney Prescott,

06:16.099 --> 06:19.018
but then she threatened to sue them
if they used her story,

06:19.102 --> 06:21.020
so then they just started making
stuff up.

06:21.104 --> 06:24.398
"Stab 5" has time travel,
which is by far the worst.

06:24.483 --> 06:27.067
Don't we hear enough
about this story every year?

06:27.152 --> 06:30.321
At least Woodsboro's known
for something.

06:30.405 --> 06:33.115
(faint rattle)
Did you hear that?

06:33.200 --> 06:35.326
Uh...

06:35.410 --> 06:37.953
no, I didn't hear anything.

06:38.038 --> 06:39.079
I did.

06:39.164 --> 06:41.874
Jenny?

06:41.958 --> 06:44.293
- Don't try to scare me.
- I'm not trying to scare you.

06:44.377 --> 06:46.754
- You do it all the time.
- No, I don't.

06:46.838 --> 06:49.798
- Where are you going?
- I told you, I heard something.

06:49.883 --> 06:53.511
- I know you're trying to scare me.
- I'm not.

06:53.595 --> 06:55.679
(faint thudding)

07:00.143 --> 07:02.311
What is it?

07:02.395 --> 07:05.356
I must have left a window
in my room open.

07:05.440 --> 07:08.108
(telephone rings)

07:08.193 --> 07:10.819
Could you get that?

07:10.904 --> 07:12.488
- Marnie?
- Yeah.

07:12.572 --> 07:15.241
(ringing continues)

07:15.325 --> 07:17.034
(beep)

07:17.118 --> 07:20.913
- Hello?
- (Ghostface) Hello. Who is this?

07:20.997 --> 07:23.165
Marnie.
Who's this?

07:23.250 --> 07:28.671
This is the last person
you're ever gonna see alive.

07:28.755 --> 07:31.006
- What?
- (laughs)

07:31.091 --> 07:34.677
(laughing) I'm sorry.

07:34.761 --> 07:36.303
I had to.

07:36.388 --> 07:38.556
(sigh) You bitch.

07:38.640 --> 07:40.432
So not funny.

07:40.517 --> 07:42.768
Somebody falls for it
every year.

07:42.852 --> 07:44.937
I don't see why you get off on this sh...

07:45.021 --> 07:46.480
(chokes, gasps)

07:46.565 --> 07:48.190
(dial tone)
Marnie?

07:48.275 --> 07:49.858
(crash)

07:49.943 --> 07:52.111
(beep)
Marnie?

07:55.282 --> 07:57.366
Marnie?

08:03.790 --> 08:07.084
Good one, Marnie.
Lights out, phone on the floor?

08:07.168 --> 08:11.964
You know,
you really should direct horror films.

08:12.048 --> 08:14.758
Wherever you are.

08:14.843 --> 08:17.344
(sighs) Let me guess.

08:17.429 --> 08:21.932
You want me to walk by an open doorframe
so you can pop out, huh?

08:23.476 --> 08:25.603
(telephone rings, gasps)

08:25.687 --> 08:30.024
(chuckles) Okay, timing,
timing is perfect.

08:30.108 --> 08:32.900
But you don't have the app
on your phone,

08:32.986 --> 08:35.738
so you can't talk like Ghostface,
can you?

08:35.822 --> 08:37.990
(Ghostface) Yes I can.

08:38.073 --> 08:41.159
- Who is this?
- Not an app.

08:41.244 --> 08:42.660
Is this Trevor?

08:42.746 --> 08:45.748
Do I sound like a Trevor to you?
Think of me as your director.

08:45.832 --> 08:49.418
You're in my movie.
You got a fun part, so don't blow it.

08:49.502 --> 08:51.670
- What movie?
- Same one Marnie's in.

08:51.755 --> 08:54.256
Only her part got cut way back.

08:54.341 --> 08:57.134
But you, you're the dumb blonde
with the big tits.

08:57.218 --> 09:00.054
We'll have some fun with you
before you die.

09:00.138 --> 09:05.517
I have a 4.0 GPA and 135 IQ, asshole.
What did you do with Marnie?

09:05.602 --> 09:08.395
- She's on the cutting room floor.
- That's not funny.

09:08.480 --> 09:10.314
This isn't a comedy.
It's a horror film.

09:10.398 --> 09:13.901
People live, people die.
And you'd better start running.

09:13.985 --> 09:16.820
(screams)

09:16.905 --> 09:18.864
(dog barking in distance)

09:18.948 --> 09:20.616
Marnie?

09:20.700 --> 09:22.368
(whimpers)

09:22.452 --> 09:25.120
(screams)

09:28.166 --> 09:29.917
(screaming)

09:33.546 --> 09:36.048
(panting)

09:47.602 --> 09:49.728
(screaming)

09:54.693 --> 09:56.235
(grunts)

10:06.788 --> 10:09.123
(garage door whirs)

10:14.003 --> 10:16.463
(grunting and whimpering)

10:29.602 --> 10:31.687
(screams, crunch)

10:34.566 --> 10:38.068
(whimpering)

10:38.153 --> 10:50.122
(screams)

10:50.206 --> 10:53.333
(woman screams,
"Something To Die For" plays)

10:57.297 --> 11:00.507
Working for another hour tonight

11:00.592 --> 11:04.261
Staring at the wall
and let the time just pass me by

11:04.345 --> 11:07.681
You might think you know me,
but it's all just a face

11:07.766 --> 11:11.101
Trying to ignore
when people screaming my name

11:11.186 --> 11:12.644
When something's right

11:12.729 --> 11:16.982
Then something is worth to die for

11:17.066 --> 11:19.693
When I feel
that something is wrong

11:19.778 --> 11:24.114
Then something
is worth to fight for

11:24.199 --> 11:26.575
Don't say goodbye

11:26.659 --> 11:30.871
Just leave an open door

11:30.955 --> 11:33.624
I wanna hear you say

11:33.708 --> 11:37.920
You give me
something to die for...

11:38.004 --> 11:40.631
What do you think?

11:40.715 --> 11:42.382
Well,
I guess today is the anniversary.

11:42.467 --> 11:46.053
- (sighs) Kids.
- No, I meant the display.

11:46.137 --> 11:47.346
Oh. (chuckles)

11:52.685 --> 11:53.727
It's good.

11:53.812 --> 11:55.979
Told the owner I'd kill his cat
if he didn't get it right.

11:56.064 --> 11:58.982
(chuckles) Nice.

11:59.067 --> 12:01.151
(cell phone vibrating,
playing "Axel F")

12:06.658 --> 12:08.283
(music stops)

12:30.682 --> 12:31.849
(car alarm chirps)

12:37.522 --> 12:39.857
(car approaching,
roach music blaring)

12:39.941 --> 12:43.068
Ho! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
25, stay alive!

12:43.152 --> 12:45.988
Shit.
Sorry, Sheriff!

12:46.072 --> 12:49.199
Kirby.

12:49.284 --> 12:50.993
(rock music continues)

12:51.077 --> 12:52.286
Whoo.

12:58.835 --> 13:01.753
(horn honks)

13:05.592 --> 13:08.677
Hey, before you get in the car,
you have to promise not to kill me.

13:08.761 --> 13:10.846
Why? What did you do?

13:10.930 --> 13:13.599
- Trevor called me last night.
- Why is he calling you?

13:13.683 --> 13:15.517
Because you won't take his calls.

13:15.602 --> 13:18.061
He knows I have your ear,
and he wants to know.

13:18.146 --> 13:21.440
- Know what?
- How upset you are.

13:21.524 --> 13:23.483
Can we just not talk about this now,
please?

13:23.568 --> 13:25.027
(softly) Fine. Fine.

13:25.111 --> 13:27.613
Okay,
so Trevor called me last night.

13:27.697 --> 13:29.197
He called you, too?

13:29.282 --> 13:31.033
He's worried your cousin
coming to Woodsboro's

13:31.117 --> 13:33.619
distracting you from knowing
how sorry he really is.

13:33.703 --> 13:36.330
- Well, that's inventive.
- (chuckling) Oh, God.

13:36.414 --> 13:38.165
(engine starts)

13:38.249 --> 13:41.126
Problem with Trevor
is he never quits.

13:41.210 --> 13:44.338
By the way, have you seen
the Grim Reaper, Angel of Death?

13:44.422 --> 13:47.174
- What are you talking about?
- Your cousin.

13:47.258 --> 13:49.176
- Sidney.
- Last stop on her book tour.

13:49.260 --> 13:53.680
First stop on her road to a new life.
It's very dramatic.

13:53.765 --> 13:55.974
She's the reason
why I love horror movies.

13:56.059 --> 14:00.562
I'm sure she'd love to hear that.
If I knew her, which I don't really.

14:00.647 --> 14:05.192
Wherever she went, people died.
Other people, it was never her.

14:05.276 --> 14:07.194
I mean, "Stab"
is the wrong franchise for her.

14:07.278 --> 14:08.987
It should be "Final Destination."
(cell phone rings)

14:09.072 --> 14:10.989
Okay,
why is Jenny Randall calling me?

14:11.074 --> 14:13.158
- Ooh, the other woman.
- Hello?

14:13.242 --> 14:15.619
- (Ghostface) Hello, Jill.
- Can't stand Jenny.

14:15.703 --> 14:18.914
Shh! Jenny?
Is this you?

14:18.998 --> 14:22.626
- What's your favorite scary movie?
- Okay, who is this?

14:22.710 --> 14:24.252
What does she want?

14:24.337 --> 14:27.297
(beep)
I said, who is this?

14:27.382 --> 14:32.010
(angrily) I asked you a question.
What's your favorite scary movie?

14:32.095 --> 14:34.388
I'm hanging up.

14:34.472 --> 14:35.555
(beep)

14:35.640 --> 14:38.892
Wow. (chuckles)
That was original.

14:38.977 --> 14:42.145
I got a call like that this morning
from Marnie the Carny.

14:42.230 --> 14:43.397
What?

14:43.481 --> 14:46.024
Watch out!
(horn blares, tires squeal)

14:46.109 --> 14:48.360
(man) Nice move, asshole!

14:48.444 --> 14:51.822
(panting) You just ran a stop sign.

14:51.906 --> 14:54.449
Sorry.

14:54.534 --> 14:58.078
- (sighs)
- Angel of Death.

14:58.162 --> 15:00.497
(indistinct radio chatter)

15:03.001 --> 15:05.377
(woman) The mayor wants these down
before lunch.

15:05.461 --> 15:10.590
(man) Only twenty-five more to go.

15:10.675 --> 15:13.468
- Morning, Sheriff.
- Morning, Deputy.

15:13.553 --> 15:15.220
- Joe.
- Morning, Sheriff.

15:15.304 --> 15:18.557
Looks like the celebration's begun.

15:18.641 --> 15:21.268
- High school kids, probably.
- Yeah.

15:21.352 --> 15:24.604
One generation's tragedy
is the next one's joke.

15:24.689 --> 15:27.691
Sorry you can never get away
from this.

15:27.775 --> 15:30.944
You know, I wish I'd been old enough
to be part of the force

15:31.029 --> 15:32.738
when you were solving those crimes.

15:32.822 --> 15:34.114
Why's that?

15:34.198 --> 15:37.784
It's those intense investigations
that really bond relationships.

15:37.869 --> 15:40.871
Well, yeah.

15:40.955 --> 15:42.706
How is Gale, by the way?

15:42.790 --> 15:45.500
Gale's good.
She's writing.

15:45.585 --> 15:48.712
Fiction.
Or trying.

15:48.796 --> 15:51.798
Hey, I made some lemon squares.
They're in my car.

15:51.883 --> 15:54.801
Uh, thanks, Deputy,
but no thanks.

15:54.886 --> 15:59.222
Sheriff, you're not cheatin' on your
wife if you eat my lemon square.

15:59.307 --> 16:02.642
Yeah, but I would be cheatin'
on my diet.

16:02.727 --> 16:05.062
(both laugh)
Sheriff Riley? Come in, Sheriff Riley!

16:05.146 --> 16:07.189
This is Sheriff Riley.
Go ahead.

16:07.273 --> 16:09.399
You gotta get over
to the Randall house right away.

16:09.484 --> 16:11.777
It's bad, Sheriff, real bad.

16:14.739 --> 16:17.866
(engine starts, sirens wail)

16:23.456 --> 16:25.290
The book is "Out of Darkness,"

16:25.374 --> 16:28.168
and its author, Sidney Prescott,
is here with us today.

16:28.252 --> 16:31.463
Have the seven "Stab" movies,
all based on Gale Weathers' books

16:31.547 --> 16:34.883
about you,
made it even harder to go on?

16:34.967 --> 16:37.761
I don't blame Gale.
That's in the past.

16:37.845 --> 16:42.766
If I was a victim for too long,
it was up to me to reinvent myself.

16:42.850 --> 16:45.727
- That's why I wrote this book.
- Sidney Prescott, everybody.

16:45.812 --> 16:49.022
And rave reviews for her book
"Out of Darkness."

16:49.107 --> 16:50.982
All right, Gale, let's do it.

16:51.067 --> 16:53.860
Let's reinvent myself.

16:53.945 --> 16:55.904
(sighs)

16:55.988 --> 16:58.698
Except...

16:58.783 --> 17:05.872
"I have... no fucking idea...
what to... write."

17:05.957 --> 17:07.290
(sighs)

17:15.424 --> 17:16.800
Oh, is that new?

17:16.884 --> 17:19.426
That's the 2.0 upgraded version.
I'm totally mobile now.

17:19.512 --> 17:21.762
Nice. Look.

17:21.848 --> 17:25.016
Oh, this is "Hall Pass"
with Robbie Mercer,

17:25.101 --> 17:28.270
here with the luscious Olivia "Don't
look at my tits, I have a mind" Morris.

17:28.354 --> 17:31.398
Here is my Woodsboro Massacre
anniversary question:

17:31.482 --> 17:33.358
What is your favorite
scary movie?

17:33.442 --> 17:35.861
Is that all you've got?
Some stupid douche question?

17:35.945 --> 17:37.904
Yeah,
where'd you hear that anyways?

17:37.989 --> 17:40.323
It's a line from "Stab One," duh.
Hey, Charlie.

17:40.408 --> 17:43.618
You're a, a genre nut, Kirby.
What's your favorite scary movie?

17:43.703 --> 17:44.995
"Bambi."

17:45.079 --> 17:47.247
Dork. What?

17:47.331 --> 17:49.207
That's funny, Kirby.

17:49.292 --> 17:50.959
(girls chuckle)

17:51.043 --> 17:54.838
- Completely unaware you exist.
- No, man, she wants me.

17:57.550 --> 18:00.385
(chuckles) Yeah, I wish, right?
Asshole.

18:00.469 --> 18:02.804
I think Charlie likes you.

18:02.889 --> 18:04.681
And I like him.

18:04.765 --> 18:07.642
To tease, to torment,
to make him squirm.

18:07.727 --> 18:10.729
You could do a lot worse,
trust me.

18:10.813 --> 18:12.898
- (gasps)
- Oh!

18:12.982 --> 18:16.067
Hi, Trevor.
Bye, Trevor.

18:16.152 --> 18:18.612
Can we talk?

18:18.696 --> 18:22.032
Somebody cares about you over here,
you know?

18:22.116 --> 18:24.743
Someone who made you
really happy once.

18:24.827 --> 18:27.078
Someone who never
should have let you go.

18:27.163 --> 18:30.999
When you're done with a phone call,
you let someone go.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.793
Or when you take someone to the airport,
you let them go.

18:33.878 --> 18:37.005
When you tell someone you love her,
she gives you everything,

18:37.089 --> 18:38.840
and then you just go out
with someone else,

18:38.925 --> 18:40.884
that is not letting her go,
that's dumping her, okay?

18:40.968 --> 18:43.887
That's... that's betrayal.

18:43.971 --> 18:46.431
(laughs) Trevor Sheldon,

18:46.515 --> 18:49.184
denied live on "Hall Pass"
with Robbie Mercer.

18:49.268 --> 18:51.186
What is your favorite scary movie,
man?

18:51.270 --> 18:53.563
I'll show you. (snarls)

18:59.820 --> 19:02.948
(Sidney) And I began to believe myself
that that was all I was,

19:03.032 --> 19:07.869
a victim,
and that was unacceptable to me.

19:07.954 --> 19:11.539
So, I sat down...

19:11.624 --> 19:15.043
and began to write
a new role that would be my own,

19:15.127 --> 19:18.380
a role for a woman who could leave
the walls of fear behind

19:18.464 --> 19:21.841
and step out into the sunlight,
out of darkness.

19:21.926 --> 19:24.970
(applause)
Thank you.

19:25.054 --> 19:28.014
Okay, we're gonna start
the book signing in a sec.

19:28.099 --> 19:31.810
So buy your copies while they last.
Lookin' at you, ladies.

19:31.894 --> 19:36.064
New York Times bestseller.
Rave reviews.

19:36.148 --> 19:38.650
Gale.
I'm glad you came.

19:38.734 --> 19:39.776
Congratulations, Sidney.

19:39.860 --> 19:42.362
I haven't had a chance
to read it yet, but...

19:42.446 --> 19:45.573
I know where you can get one.
(chuckles)

19:46.909 --> 19:50.287
Dewey! Hey!

19:50.371 --> 19:52.539
Hey, Sid.
Gale, you made it.

19:52.623 --> 19:54.291
(sirens wailing, tires screeching)
What are you doing here?

19:54.375 --> 19:56.459
Sid, I'm sorry,
I gotta do something here.

19:56.544 --> 19:58.461
- Shit!
- I'm really sorry.

19:58.546 --> 20:00.922
Excuse me!
This will only take a minute.

20:01.007 --> 20:04.259
I need you all to stay where you are
and remain silent.

20:04.343 --> 20:06.052
Nobody leaves yet.
The Sheriff thanks you.

20:06.137 --> 20:08.430
Can this wait, Barney Fife?
I'm running an event here.

20:08.514 --> 20:11.433
- Ma'am, this is a police event now.
- What's going on?

20:11.517 --> 20:14.185
Gale, this is police business.
If you could just let us handle this.

20:14.270 --> 20:17.063
I'm talking to my husband,
Deputy Judy.

20:17.148 --> 20:19.024
Listen, there's a phone we believe

20:19.108 --> 20:21.026
may have been taken
from the scene of a crime.

20:21.110 --> 20:24.863
Deputy Hicks has traced its location
back to these coordinates.

20:24.947 --> 20:26.781
The rest is need-to-know.

20:26.866 --> 20:30.410
- And I'm not "need-to-know"?
- Shh.

20:30.494 --> 20:32.704
(cell phone ringing)
Hoss, I'm hearing something.

20:32.788 --> 20:35.081
Sheriff, it's ringing out here!

20:37.168 --> 20:38.877
(ringing continues)

20:38.961 --> 20:40.086
There!

20:45.468 --> 20:47.552
- It's coming from the trunk.
- There.

20:47.636 --> 20:50.305
Dewey?
Gonna need everyone to stay back.

20:50.389 --> 20:52.724
- Not now, Sid.
- It's my rental.

20:59.482 --> 21:02.275
(all gasp)

21:02.360 --> 21:04.778
Okay,
it's now an official crime scene.

21:04.862 --> 21:06.613
Let's lock it down.
Get that camera outta here!

21:06.697 --> 21:09.240
- Everybody back.
- Gimme that camera.

21:09.325 --> 21:11.368
Please tell me this is a prank,
Dewey.

21:11.452 --> 21:13.870
- I'm afraid not, Sid.
- On the curb, ma'am.

21:13.954 --> 21:15.747
- Come on.
- Everybody, get back!

21:15.831 --> 21:18.041
Henry, you're not gonna believe
what just happened.

21:18.125 --> 21:20.085
Stand back, Gale. Gale.

21:20.169 --> 21:21.836
I just wanna see.

21:21.921 --> 21:23.880
(man) Cover up your kid's eyes!

21:23.964 --> 21:27.217
Okay,
essays are due Tuesday.

21:27.301 --> 21:29.969
"Why Woodsboro is the best..."
(multiple cell phones ringing)

21:30.054 --> 21:34.224
Anything with an on/off switch
should be off, that's the rule!

21:34.308 --> 21:36.684
Somebody wanna share?

21:36.769 --> 21:39.354
Jenny Randall and Marnie Cooper
were murdered last night.

21:39.438 --> 21:41.523
- What?
- What?

21:41.607 --> 21:42.941
Stabbed to death.

21:43.025 --> 21:45.360
- What's your favorite scary...
- Shut up!

21:45.444 --> 21:48.363
- Yo, it's a news van!
- Class is not over!

21:48.447 --> 21:49.739
That was fast.

21:49.824 --> 21:53.660
This week marks the anniversary
of the infamous Woodsboro Murders.

21:53.744 --> 21:58.706
Two girls killed the exact day
local celebrity victim Sidney Prescott

21:58.791 --> 22:00.542
chose to return to her hometown.

22:00.626 --> 22:03.211
It all could be something right out
of a Gale Weathers best-seller.

22:03.295 --> 22:04.879
And where is she now?

22:04.964 --> 22:06.339
Well, living right here in Woodsboro...

22:06.424 --> 22:09.008
- Mrs. Riley.
- Hoss.

22:09.093 --> 22:12.053
- First Lady.
- Perkins.

22:12.138 --> 22:14.222
Excuse me, Gale.
He's conducting an interview.

22:14.306 --> 22:15.807
Great.
I love interviews.

22:15.891 --> 22:18.560
You'll have to wait, Gale.
Sorry, can't let you in there.

22:18.644 --> 22:22.147
(chuckles) What are you gonna do,
arrest me, Deputy Judy?

22:22.231 --> 22:23.523
If it comes to it.

22:23.607 --> 22:25.525
Civilian interference
with a police investigation

22:25.609 --> 22:27.360
poses many a problem
in a court of law.

22:27.445 --> 22:29.070
Okay, listen to me, Judy.

22:29.155 --> 22:31.364
I don't mind that you're working
with my husband

22:31.449 --> 22:34.617
or that you even bake him
those little treats as you do.

22:34.702 --> 22:36.786
But if you're gonna start
acting like him,

22:36.871 --> 22:38.872
you ought to put a moustache on
'cause you sound ridiculous.

22:38.956 --> 22:40.331
- Gale!
- Judy!

22:40.416 --> 22:44.627
- Gale! (clears throat)
- Deputy. Gale.

22:44.712 --> 22:46.838
(whispering) Please.

22:46.922 --> 22:49.174
Uh, Sidney,
if you don't mind givin' us a minute.

22:49.258 --> 22:51.301
- Sid.
- Hi, Gale.

22:51.385 --> 22:54.637
Dewey, would you please explain
to Betty Crocker

22:54.722 --> 22:56.848
that I have every right to be here?

22:56.932 --> 23:00.560
If there's been another murder
in Woodsboro, obviously... what?

23:00.644 --> 23:03.188
(whispering)
That is not public information!

23:03.272 --> 23:06.107
- It is all over the Internet, Dewey!
- It is?

23:06.192 --> 23:09.152
Yes! The whole world knows
about it before me!

23:09.236 --> 23:11.946
She wants to be a part
of the investigation, Sheriff.

23:12.031 --> 23:13.865
(sighs) Hang on.

23:13.949 --> 23:19.621
Um, are you familiar with the phrase,
"I wrote the book on this"?

23:22.750 --> 23:26.544
Gale, with all due respect,
I don't see how that pertains to...

23:26.629 --> 23:29.422
Because I wrote the book on this!

23:29.507 --> 23:33.092
"The Woodsboro Murders"
by Gale Weathers?

23:33.177 --> 23:35.637
But you're not a reporter anymore,
Gale.

23:35.721 --> 23:37.138
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- And even if you were...

23:37.223 --> 23:39.307
Don't treat me like I'm the media.

23:39.391 --> 23:43.645
I helped solve these things three times,
remember?

23:43.729 --> 23:45.522
You and me.
Together.

23:45.606 --> 23:48.399
(sighs)
But I'm the Sheriff now, Gale.

23:48.484 --> 23:51.819
Right?

23:51.904 --> 23:54.239
What, you're not gonna let me
help you with this?

23:54.323 --> 23:57.242
I can't.

23:57.326 --> 23:59.619
All right,
then I'm going rogue.

23:59.703 --> 24:02.163
This is what I'm good at,
Dewey.

24:02.248 --> 24:06.084
This is what I know how to do.

24:06.168 --> 24:10.255
(clears throat)

24:10.339 --> 24:12.632
Your lemon squares taste like ass.

24:14.677 --> 24:17.637
They don't.
They really don't.

24:17.721 --> 24:18.846
Thank you, sir.

24:18.931 --> 24:20.932
- Sheriff.
- Yeah?

24:21.016 --> 24:22.684
We've got a couple
high school kids in here.

24:22.768 --> 24:25.770
Two of 'em, they say they got
threatening phone calls this morning

24:25.854 --> 24:27.522
from the victims' phones.

24:27.606 --> 24:31.067
Names are Olivia Morris
and Jill Roberts.

24:31.151 --> 24:34.362
That's Sid's cousin.
Damn.

24:34.446 --> 24:36.781
Right in here, Sheriff.

24:36.865 --> 24:38.908
- Hey, Jill.
- Sidney.

24:38.993 --> 24:41.202
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:41.287 --> 24:43.705
It's nice to see you
even under the circumstances.

24:43.789 --> 24:45.790
(both chuckle)
You okay?

24:45.874 --> 24:48.418
- Yeah.
- So two of you got phone calls?

24:48.502 --> 24:52.046
Yeah, us two.
"What's your favorite scary movie?"

24:52.131 --> 24:55.216
It was the killer's voice.
From "Stab."

24:55.301 --> 24:57.927
Or, I mean, you know,
from your life.

24:58.012 --> 25:00.471
I'm Kirby, by the way.
I'm their friend.

25:00.556 --> 25:02.974
And the killer didn't call you?

25:03.058 --> 25:07.061
No.
Is... is that a bad thing?

25:07.146 --> 25:09.188
Does that mean that I'm not gonna
live as long as these two?

25:09.273 --> 25:10.398
(chuckling) No.

25:10.482 --> 25:11.608
Maybe.

25:11.692 --> 25:15.278
Of course not.
Just, uh, just be careful.

25:15.362 --> 25:18.573
Oh, my God, did you hear that?
I'm gonna be next!

25:18.657 --> 25:20.742
Dewey, I shouldn't be here.
I should leave town.

25:20.826 --> 25:22.910
I'm afraid that's not really possible,
Sidney.

25:22.995 --> 25:28.458
Look, nobody thinks you're involved,
but everyone's a suspect, I'm sorry.

25:28.542 --> 25:31.419
And there was evidence in your car,
connecting the killer to you.

25:31.503 --> 25:33.046
You may be a material witness.

25:33.130 --> 25:35.256
(sighs)

25:35.341 --> 25:39.886
So, look, you'll have, uh,
24-hour police protection.

25:39.970 --> 25:43.222
That's comforting.

25:43.307 --> 25:45.058
(beep)
This is Rebecca.

25:45.142 --> 25:49.354
Oh, my fucking God, Henry!
Yes! It's true.

25:49.438 --> 25:52.774
Two girls butchered.
(chuckles) Payday.

25:52.858 --> 25:56.569
I was so not feeling Woodsboro.
I was like, lame PR move, right?

25:56.654 --> 26:01.074
Well, fuck me wow.
Best idea ever.

26:01.158 --> 26:04.160
Henry, I'll call you back.
(beep)

26:04.244 --> 26:06.287
Excuse me I have to geek out.

26:06.372 --> 26:07.872
I didn't get a chance
to say something earlier,

26:07.956 --> 26:09.540
but it's such an honor to meet you.

26:09.625 --> 26:12.001
- Thank you. Hi.
- Rebecca Walters.

26:12.086 --> 26:14.962
When I was a kid, it was all about
"Top Story with Gale Weathers."

26:15.047 --> 26:18.383
- (chuckles) You were my '90s.
- Well, it's Gale Riley now.

26:18.467 --> 26:20.134
You gave it all up for love,
I know that.

26:20.219 --> 26:21.594
How long have you
and Dewey been married?

26:21.679 --> 26:23.429
- Ten years.
- Aww!

26:23.514 --> 26:25.765
Just like your characters
in "Stab 3." Wow.

26:25.849 --> 26:27.600
Wow.

26:27.685 --> 26:29.852
Oh, I didn't mean bad wow.

26:29.937 --> 26:31.979
It just, it always seemed like more
of a movie romance than a real one

26:32.064 --> 26:35.191
because it was a movie and in real life
you two would never be...

26:35.275 --> 26:38.861
Ooh, dug a hole.
(chuckles nervously) Climbing out here.

26:38.946 --> 26:42.824
So anyway kudos on being brave enough
to drop off the professional map.

26:42.908 --> 26:45.785
Any plans on revitalizing
your tarnished brand?

26:45.869 --> 26:47.704
Listen, in about two seconds,

26:47.788 --> 26:50.707
I'm gonna revitalize your face
with my tarnished brand.

26:50.791 --> 26:52.208
Ooh...

26:52.292 --> 26:55.253
I still got it.

26:55.337 --> 26:57.213
Testy.

27:05.472 --> 27:07.640
She's so pretty.

27:07.725 --> 27:10.101
When you think about what she survived,
she must have scars everywhere.

27:10.185 --> 27:12.395
Shh!

27:12.479 --> 27:16.649
Her mom was my sister.
I have scars, too.

27:16.734 --> 27:19.444
No one ever asks me
about my scars.

27:19.528 --> 27:23.322
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Roberts.
- She means knife scars, Mom.

27:23.407 --> 27:25.116
Oh.

27:25.200 --> 27:29.036
Well... fine.

27:29.121 --> 27:31.456
How are you?

27:31.540 --> 27:33.708
How's Gale?

27:33.792 --> 27:36.836
Uh, I'm all right.

27:36.920 --> 27:40.882
But Gale, it's been hard on her.

27:40.966 --> 27:44.343
Small town...
small-town husband.

27:44.428 --> 27:47.597
(chuckles humorlessly)
Not much to write about.

27:47.681 --> 27:51.434
You two okay?

27:51.518 --> 27:54.520
Well, I read somewhere once,

27:54.605 --> 27:57.815
"Just when you think things can't
get any worse,

27:57.900 --> 27:59.484
"sometimes they don't.

27:59.568 --> 28:02.361
(chuckling)
Sometimes they get better."

28:02.446 --> 28:05.656
"Out of Darkness" by Sidney Prescott,
page 220.

28:06.992 --> 28:08.493
(both chuckle)

28:13.415 --> 28:16.209
Gotta get going.

28:22.633 --> 28:26.177
It's nice to see you, Dewey.
Been through a lot together.

28:26.261 --> 28:28.888
And we'll get through this, too.
Okay?

28:28.972 --> 28:30.848
- Lock up.
- Mm-hmm.

28:34.394 --> 28:36.521
(indistinct radio chatter)

28:50.452 --> 28:51.828
- (gasps)
- Be cool.

28:51.912 --> 28:54.580
It's okay. It's just me.
Relax, relax. It's just me.

28:54.665 --> 28:57.250
What the hell are you doing here?
There are cops right out front.

28:57.334 --> 28:59.836
No match for the ninja, baby.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.712
(sighs)

29:01.797 --> 29:05.216
Anyway, what are you doing in the house
with Sidney Prescott?

29:05.300 --> 29:07.677
I mean, that's like being on "Top Chef"
with Jeffrey Dahmer.

29:07.761 --> 29:10.304
Can you please get away
from the window?

29:10.389 --> 29:13.808
Y-You have no right to be in here.
Not anymore.

29:13.892 --> 29:15.476
Hang on.

29:15.561 --> 29:18.604
I heard you got a phone call
from the killer.

29:18.689 --> 29:21.566
- Is that true?
- (sighs) What do you care?

29:21.650 --> 29:24.652
Don't you think you'd be
a lot safer with me around?

29:24.736 --> 29:26.946
I don't trust you Trevor.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.322
Hey.

29:28.407 --> 29:31.909
Then I'm just gonna have
to make sure that you do, all right?

29:31.994 --> 29:34.662
(knock on door)

29:34.746 --> 29:36.455
Oh, sorry, I didn't...

29:36.540 --> 29:39.208
No, he's just leaving.
It's... it's my ex.

29:39.293 --> 29:40.501
Oh.

29:40.586 --> 29:43.379
Yeah.
Her one and only.

29:43.463 --> 29:45.631
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:45.716 --> 29:48.426
It's cool to meet you... officially.

29:48.510 --> 29:53.598
I keep meaning to pick up a copy
of your book, but...

29:53.682 --> 29:56.183
- You're smaller in person.
- (chuckles)

30:01.398 --> 30:03.441
(chuckles softly)

30:03.525 --> 30:04.734
What?

30:04.818 --> 30:09.655
Nothing. You just, uh...
you remind me of, uh... me.

30:09.740 --> 30:13.367
- (chuckles softly)
- Lock your window, okay?

30:13.452 --> 30:15.369
Yeah. Good night.

30:15.454 --> 30:17.747
'Night.

30:17.831 --> 30:20.499
- (gasps)
- Sorry about that.

30:20.584 --> 30:24.545
Just makin' my rounds
before takin' off.

30:24.630 --> 30:27.256
Great. Thanks.

30:27.341 --> 30:31.344
Y-You don't remember me,
do ya?

30:31.428 --> 30:32.845
Sorry?

30:32.930 --> 30:36.641
We went to high school together.
Judy Hicks?

30:36.725 --> 30:40.853
We had the same homeroom
and Drama Club, too.

30:40.938 --> 30:45.024
We were in "Peter Pan" together.
I played a Lost Boy.

30:45.108 --> 30:49.111
You were... Tiger Lily.

30:50.739 --> 30:54.200
I'm sorry,
that was a long time ago.

30:54.284 --> 30:56.702
It's okay.

30:56.787 --> 31:01.290
You had a lot of stuff goin'
on back then.

31:01.375 --> 31:04.794
Well, it's nice to see you again,
Judy.

31:04.878 --> 31:05.962
You too.

31:06.046 --> 31:08.130
(door opens,
indistinct radio chatter)

31:08.215 --> 31:10.800
(clears throat)

31:10.884 --> 31:15.096
- (clears throat)
- (man) Everything okay upstairs?

31:15.180 --> 31:19.517
You're supposed to be out front,
Perkins.

31:19.601 --> 31:21.686
(pop music playing on radio)

31:26.191 --> 31:28.818
What's a 4-letter word
for "courage"?

31:28.902 --> 31:31.070
Uh...

31:31.154 --> 31:32.363
"guts."

31:37.744 --> 31:39.996
That's Olivia Morris.
She lives next door.

31:40.080 --> 31:43.040
She's on the list.

31:43.125 --> 31:45.459
She can live next door to me.

31:45.544 --> 31:48.212
Now, seriously, uh...
uh, Mary,

31:48.296 --> 31:50.297
I'm warning you, okay,
I'm gonna have to get physical.

31:50.382 --> 31:52.717
- I mean it. This is it!
- (snarling)

31:52.801 --> 31:54.427
Just fuck off!

31:54.511 --> 31:55.886
(growling)

31:55.971 --> 31:57.930
(girls laugh)

31:58.015 --> 32:00.099
(cell phone rings)

32:03.770 --> 32:05.855
Hello?

32:05.939 --> 32:07.356
What are you guys up to?

32:07.441 --> 32:09.483
Oh,
we're watching "Shaun of the Dead."

32:09.568 --> 32:12.153
You know there are two zombies
sitting outside the house in a car?

32:12.237 --> 32:15.322
Yup. They're cops.
You wanna come up?

32:15.407 --> 32:16.615
The Angel of Death leave?

32:16.700 --> 32:18.868
No, she's in the guest room.
(chuckles)

32:18.952 --> 32:21.996
Forget it.
Next door's close enough.

32:22.080 --> 32:25.583
- Your mom home?
- She's at her boyfriend's.

32:25.667 --> 32:27.460
It's creepy around here tonight.

32:27.544 --> 32:29.837
Well, the zombies
are still in their car.

32:29.921 --> 32:33.007
So you should be all right.

32:33.091 --> 32:35.551
- Call me tomorrow, okay?
- All right.

32:35.635 --> 32:38.846
- She didn't wanna come up?
- She fears the Reaper.

32:38.930 --> 32:41.932
Watch this.

32:42.017 --> 32:44.602
(beep, cell phone dials)

32:44.686 --> 32:47.063
(cell phone rings)

32:49.107 --> 32:51.025
(beep)
Speaking.

32:51.109 --> 32:55.237
(imitating Ghostface) What's
your favorite scary movie, Olivia?

32:55.322 --> 32:57.740
That's the worst imitation
I've ever heard, Jill.

32:57.824 --> 33:00.076
Speaking of "Stab," you heard
where the Stab-a-Thon's gonna be yet?

33:00.160 --> 33:02.411
(beep)
No, and it doesn't matter to me anyways.

33:02.496 --> 33:04.497
My mom doesn't let me go.

33:04.581 --> 33:07.083
(cell phone rings)
(sighs) It's Trevor.

33:07.167 --> 33:11.170
- I'll handle this.
- Trevor's calling. Again.

33:11.254 --> 33:14.507
- What do you want?
- (Ghostface) I wanna talk to Jill.

33:14.591 --> 33:16.926
Uh, no, it's Kirby.
Sorry, Trevor.

33:17.010 --> 33:20.179
Jill is screening her calls
from all past relationships.

33:20.263 --> 33:21.347
What's going on over there?

33:21.431 --> 33:23.599
Hang on a sec.
What is he saying?

33:23.683 --> 33:25.476
(whispers) I'm not Trevor.

33:25.560 --> 33:28.687
Wh-what?
I can barely hear you, Trevor.

33:28.772 --> 33:31.232
This isn't Trevor.

33:31.316 --> 33:32.650
Oh, a-all right.

33:32.734 --> 33:35.945
Well, then, why do you have his phone,
whoever this is?

33:36.029 --> 33:38.280
(whispering)
He's trying to do Ghostface.

33:38.365 --> 33:40.741
(chuckles) He's being weird.

33:40.826 --> 33:42.493
I wanna talk to Jill.

33:42.577 --> 33:45.329
Okay, well,
she doesn't wanna talk to you.

33:45.413 --> 33:47.414
Come on, Mr. Ghostface,
whisper to me.

33:47.499 --> 33:50.668
Aren't you supposed
to ask me a question?

33:50.752 --> 33:53.420
All right.
How's the movie?

33:53.505 --> 33:54.755
What movie?

33:54.840 --> 33:58.092
"Shaun of the Dead."

33:58.176 --> 33:59.718
How did you know that?

33:59.803 --> 34:03.305
Because I'm standing
in the closet.

34:03.390 --> 34:05.141
Stop. You are not.

34:05.225 --> 34:07.685
- What's going on?
- Trevor's being weird.

34:07.769 --> 34:09.853
- I mean, if it is him, I don't know.
- What?

34:09.938 --> 34:11.856
This is not fucking Trevor!

34:11.940 --> 34:13.899
Well then,
who the fuck are you?

34:13.984 --> 34:16.068
Open the closet door.

34:18.780 --> 34:20.947
You do know there are cops
all over this house?

34:21.032 --> 34:25.034
I think I'd have just enough time
to slice someone open.

34:25.120 --> 34:29.290
- I-I'll talk to him.
- Shh.

34:29.373 --> 34:31.667
What's going on over there,
you guys?

34:31.751 --> 34:34.795
S-Sorry.
I-I don't know. Kirby.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.338
- Shh.
- Kirby.

34:36.422 --> 34:37.922
Come on, do it.

34:38.007 --> 34:40.050
There is no way you're in there.

34:40.135 --> 34:42.636
See for yourself.

34:42.721 --> 34:44.429
Kirby?

34:44.514 --> 34:47.850
Kirby, come on. Talk to me.
This isn't funny.

34:47.934 --> 34:49.560
Kirby!

34:49.643 --> 34:51.978
(gasps)

34:56.525 --> 34:58.611
Liar. I'm over this.

34:58.695 --> 35:01.197
I never said I was in your closet.

35:05.535 --> 35:09.121
- (screaming)
- Oh, my God. Olivia!

35:09.206 --> 35:12.833
- (screaming)
- Oh, my God, help!

35:12.918 --> 35:15.461
Aaagh! (gasping)

35:24.012 --> 35:25.262
No! Help!

35:25.347 --> 35:29.475
(Olivia screaming)

35:29.559 --> 35:31.018
(grunting and panting)

35:40.070 --> 35:42.780
- Hoss!
- Somebody help!

35:42.864 --> 35:44.865
- Perkins!
- (Olivia screams)

35:44.950 --> 35:48.244
Shit!

35:48.328 --> 35:51.413
Help! Help!

35:51.498 --> 35:53.499
(girls screaming)

36:01.549 --> 36:03.509
(both screaming)

36:12.060 --> 36:14.144
(panting, door creaks)

36:28.076 --> 36:30.244
(gasps)

36:36.543 --> 36:40.212
(cell phone rings)

36:40.297 --> 36:43.215
(beep)
What?

36:43.300 --> 36:46.802
(Ghostface) Welcome home, Sidney.
Preview of coming events.

36:46.886 --> 36:49.013
Why don't you come for me?
You got the balls for that?

36:49.097 --> 36:51.640
Oh, poor Sidney.
You think this is all about you.

36:51.725 --> 36:54.977
- You think you're still the star.
- This isn't a fucking movie!

36:55.061 --> 36:57.062
- It will be.
- These are innocent people.

36:57.147 --> 36:58.397
(angrily) Spare me the lecture.

36:58.481 --> 37:01.233
You've done very well
by all this bloodshed, haven't you?

37:01.318 --> 37:03.485
Well, how about
the town you left behind?

37:03.570 --> 37:05.321
I've got plans for you.

37:05.405 --> 37:07.906
I'm gonna slit your eyelids in half
so you don't blink

37:07.991 --> 37:10.159
when I stab you in the face.

37:10.243 --> 37:13.954
You'll die when I want you to, Sidney.
Not a moment before.

37:14.039 --> 37:17.082
Until then...
you're going to suffer.

37:17.167 --> 37:18.459
(click)

37:18.543 --> 37:20.586
- Sidney?!
- Jill?

37:20.670 --> 37:23.630
- Stay right there!
- Is she...

37:23.715 --> 37:25.841
Do not look. Okay?

37:25.925 --> 37:28.510
She said
you were the Angel of Death.

37:28.595 --> 37:30.596
- Look out!
- (screams)

37:30.680 --> 37:32.973
(grunting and panting)

37:51.701 --> 37:54.912
- What's going on in here?
- He's in here.

37:54.996 --> 37:58.916
Where is he?
Ma'am?

37:59.000 --> 38:03.462
- He was.
- We'll check out back.

38:03.546 --> 38:06.465
- Jill?
- (breathes heavily) Don't.

38:15.225 --> 38:17.643
- What happened?
- (Jill whimpering)

38:17.727 --> 38:20.813
Oh, my God, Jill.

38:20.897 --> 38:26.235
Jesus! I'm here. Come on.
Let's go. Let's go. All right?

38:26.319 --> 38:29.029
Jill?

38:29.114 --> 38:31.323
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

38:31.408 --> 38:34.451
- Here, keep pressure on it.
- There's nobody back there.

38:34.536 --> 38:37.579
- Hoss, call it in.
- Right.

38:37.664 --> 38:42.042
Hey.
Are you okay?

38:42.127 --> 38:43.919
You should look upstairs.

38:52.095 --> 38:54.179
(indistinct conversations)

38:54.264 --> 38:58.684
(woman) Let's get the coroner's van
brought around, please.

38:58.768 --> 39:00.853
(indistinct radio chatter)

39:03.189 --> 39:05.399
(woman) It's all your fault, Sidney!

39:05.483 --> 39:07.693
(man) You're just like your mother!

39:07.777 --> 39:09.153
- Hoss, clear these people out.
- Right.

39:09.237 --> 39:14.032
- (woman) I thought this was over!
- Come on, leave her alone.

39:17.704 --> 39:21.290
I'm sorry about what I said.

39:21.374 --> 39:23.709
Do you wanna go get that looked at?

39:23.793 --> 39:27.129
Yeah.

39:27.213 --> 39:28.922
What the hell happened?

39:29.007 --> 39:32.676
Okay. I saw him go into that yard
two houses down right before...

39:32.760 --> 39:35.053
Yeah, and I circled around
to cut him off.

39:35.138 --> 39:36.305
And?

39:36.389 --> 39:38.807
And I met Hoss coming
from the other direction.

39:38.892 --> 39:41.768
He must've circled back around somehow.
He's like a ghost.

39:41.853 --> 39:45.314
- Chief, we're sorry.
- We feel terrible.

39:45.398 --> 39:48.400
(sighs) All right.
Get outta here.

39:53.031 --> 39:55.115
(siren wails)

40:02.582 --> 40:06.418
This is "Hall Pass" with Robbie Mercer,
webcasting live in our darkest hour.

40:06.503 --> 40:09.379
What began as a day of remembrance
has ended with serial murder.

40:09.464 --> 40:13.634
Olivia Morris, who officially
will never go out with me, is dead.

40:13.718 --> 40:15.969
So is Jenny Randall
and Marnie Cooper.

40:16.054 --> 40:19.806
Our local legacy, the "Stab" movies,
is coming to life.

40:19.891 --> 40:22.809
Excuse me.
Are you recording with that thing?

40:22.894 --> 40:25.646
Live video-blog upload.
He's webcasting right now.

40:25.730 --> 40:28.065
Oh. Mind turning it off
for a little old-school off the record?

40:28.149 --> 40:30.359
Can't.
Owe it to my audience.

40:30.443 --> 40:32.277
Turn that fucking thing off.

40:32.362 --> 40:33.820
Okay.

40:33.905 --> 40:38.909
So, you two are the boys that run
the movie club at Woodsboro High, huh?

40:38.993 --> 40:42.120
Charlie runs it.
I'm just V.P. In case he takes a bullet.

40:42.205 --> 40:43.664
It's called Cinema Club.

40:43.748 --> 40:48.627
So you must have a very unique insight
into the movie buffs at your school.

40:48.711 --> 40:50.462
Maybe.

40:50.547 --> 40:54.591
What if we could catch the killer
by working together?

40:54.676 --> 40:57.219
Two generations
of cutting-edge journalists

40:57.303 --> 41:00.430
intertwining our passions for media?

41:00.515 --> 41:02.641
What would you say?

41:02.725 --> 41:03.976
I love you.

41:04.060 --> 41:05.602
Very good.

41:05.687 --> 41:09.648
Now you give me your expertise
on the gore geek scene at Woodsboro High

41:09.732 --> 41:12.401
and maybe
I give you something in return.

41:12.485 --> 41:15.821
Say, a celebrity visit
to your Cinema Club?

41:15.905 --> 41:18.574
By me.

41:18.658 --> 41:22.619
What about Sidney?

41:22.704 --> 41:25.622
Yeah, you know her, right?
I mean, you're friends with her?

41:25.707 --> 41:28.542
No offense, but that'd be a big deal
for Cinema Club.

41:28.626 --> 41:31.420
A visit from Sidney Prescott?
I mean, she's the star.

41:31.504 --> 41:35.924
(chucked bitterly) Yes, she's
Daniel Radcliffe to my J.K. Rowling.

41:36.009 --> 41:38.552
Well, without the book sales
and the box office.

41:38.636 --> 41:40.929
Whatever.

41:41.014 --> 41:44.474
There's no broken bones.

41:44.559 --> 41:47.019
I think you'll be fine.
Take it easy.

41:47.103 --> 41:50.522
You were lucky, Sidney.

41:50.607 --> 41:53.233
So, Sidney, ooh, ow.

41:53.318 --> 41:55.235
(chuckles)
Anyway, long story short,

41:55.320 --> 41:58.614
Random wants to lock you in
to three more books now.

41:58.698 --> 42:02.200
See the blank line in your contract?
You can name your price.

42:02.285 --> 42:04.286
And as soon as you're clear
in this investigation,

42:04.370 --> 42:05.996
we're on the next plane to New York.

42:06.080 --> 42:08.624
I booked "Today," "The View,"
"Nancy Grace," "MTV News"...

42:08.708 --> 42:10.626
Excuse me.
Can I ask you a question?

42:10.710 --> 42:13.795
- Mm?
- Did you read my book?

42:13.880 --> 42:16.798
Thought I'd wait for the movie.

42:16.883 --> 42:18.800
Book tour's over.

42:18.885 --> 42:20.636
Sidney.

42:20.720 --> 42:23.138
Accept your situation.

42:23.222 --> 42:25.390
You're a victim.
For life.

42:25.475 --> 42:28.602
So embrace it, use it.

42:28.686 --> 42:31.104
I know
you care about your readers.

42:31.189 --> 42:33.231
All those little downtrodden fucks
that just need a light

42:33.316 --> 42:35.525
at the end of their tunnel
so they don't jump off a bridge.

42:35.610 --> 42:37.069
And a lucky break like this?

42:37.153 --> 42:39.988
I'm talkin' 100% increase in sales,
minimum.

42:40.073 --> 42:42.407
That's maybe a million more people
get your message,

42:42.492 --> 42:45.285
and you get a ton more checks,
win-win.

42:45.370 --> 42:49.122
(exhales)
I won't be needing you anymore.

42:49.207 --> 42:51.124
- Sidney.
- You're fired.

42:51.209 --> 42:53.418
- Fired?
- Fired.

42:53.503 --> 42:56.880
Fine.

42:56.964 --> 42:58.382
(sighs)

43:05.056 --> 43:07.140
(running footsteps)

43:12.689 --> 43:13.897
(elevator dings)

43:17.318 --> 43:20.195
"Have you even read my book,
Rebecca?"

43:20.279 --> 43:22.364
(clunk)

43:28.413 --> 43:30.747
(clunk, elevator whirs)

43:30.832 --> 43:33.375
(sighs softly)

43:33.459 --> 43:35.794
The problem with Sidney
is that she never gets laid.

43:35.878 --> 43:39.089
Or even a little shit-faced
once in a while.

43:39.173 --> 43:41.258
She'll call me tonight and apologize.

43:41.342 --> 43:43.802
(elevator dings)
Just watch.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.476
She'll come around.

43:51.561 --> 43:56.148
Gotta just give her time,
and Sidney will come around.

43:58.234 --> 44:00.110
Where did I?

44:00.194 --> 44:02.738
(car alarm chirps)

44:02.822 --> 44:04.906
Ah.
(cell phone rings)

44:08.202 --> 44:10.036
(beep)
This is Rebecca.

44:10.121 --> 44:12.164
(Ghostface) Sidney Prescott, please.

44:12.248 --> 44:14.458
I'm handling Miss Prescott's calls
and appearances.

44:14.542 --> 44:18.044
- May I take a message?
- You are the message.

44:22.091 --> 44:25.177
- Are you writing this down?
- Yes, I am.

44:25.261 --> 44:27.637
It's kind of hard to hear you.
I'm in the hospital with Sidney.

44:27.722 --> 44:29.806
If you could just hang on one second.

44:29.891 --> 44:33.226
(chuckles) I've got time.
It's you that doesn't.

44:40.151 --> 44:42.444
(car alarm blares)
You know, Rebecca,

44:42.528 --> 44:45.489
it doesn't sound to me
like you're in the hospital.

44:45.573 --> 44:48.742
Sounds like you're in a parking garage.

44:48.826 --> 44:52.454
A dark
and deserted parking garage.

44:54.332 --> 44:57.626
But if you want to be in the hospital,
I'd be happy to put you there.

44:57.710 --> 44:59.669
In the fucking morgue!

45:07.220 --> 45:09.304
(door locks click)

45:14.602 --> 45:16.686
(cell phone rings)
Ah!

45:20.024 --> 45:21.733
No.
(ringing stops)

45:21.818 --> 45:23.235
(keys jingling)

45:26.280 --> 45:28.365
(engine cranks)

45:40.753 --> 45:41.962
(screams)

45:46.175 --> 45:49.010
Help! Help!

45:49.095 --> 45:50.887
Help me!
(tires squeal)

45:50.972 --> 45:52.681
Help!

46:05.319 --> 46:07.904
Cut and run,
you fucking bastard.

46:14.579 --> 46:16.121
(door locks click)

46:39.937 --> 46:42.022
(car alarm blaring)
(screams)

47:03.294 --> 47:05.629
(screams)

47:16.599 --> 47:19.017
This is an ongoing investigation.

47:19.101 --> 47:23.396
Rest assured,
we're pursuing a number of leads.

47:23.481 --> 47:25.815
The less I say about that,
the better.

47:25.900 --> 47:29.778
- So I'm taking questions.
- Sheriff! Sheriff!

47:29.862 --> 47:31.613
- Dewey!
- Gale?

47:31.697 --> 47:33.782
Any comment on the fact
that these killings

47:33.866 --> 47:37.285
seem to resemble the pattern
of the original Woodsboro Murders?

47:37.370 --> 47:39.371
Hon? (whispers) Later.

47:39.455 --> 47:41.331
(woman) What was that, Sheriff?

47:41.415 --> 47:45.543
As I was saying, uh,
my officers are hard at work,

47:45.628 --> 47:49.255
and we just want the community
to know that we are very close

47:49.340 --> 47:51.800
to bringing this whole situation
under control...

47:51.884 --> 47:53.218
- (woman screams)
- Agh!

47:53.302 --> 47:55.845
(crowd screaming)

47:55.930 --> 47:59.015
(man) Oh, shit!

47:59.100 --> 48:02.268
Someone, get up to the top
of the structure! Go, go!

48:02.353 --> 48:05.397
- Everyone back! Stay back!
- All right, nobody move!

48:05.481 --> 48:07.315
Listen,
I want a man on each stairwell!

48:10.152 --> 48:13.071
- You see anybody?
- Nobody up here.

48:13.155 --> 48:15.532
There's nobody up there,
Sheriff!

48:15.616 --> 48:18.827
It's all under control,
huh, Sheriff?

48:18.911 --> 48:21.037
What am I supposed to say?

48:21.122 --> 48:23.331
Listen,
I may not be wearing a uniform,

48:23.416 --> 48:25.709
but I happen to have a lead,
and you don't.

48:25.793 --> 48:29.838
So let me know when you're back
on Team Gale.

48:29.922 --> 48:34.426
Move it, amateurs!

48:34.510 --> 48:36.428
(over PA) And remember, students,

48:36.512 --> 48:39.681
tonight's town curfew is 9:00.

48:39.765 --> 48:43.685
You should be home with your doors
locked at 9:00.

48:43.769 --> 48:46.021
Okay, Cinema Club.
We are now in session.

48:46.105 --> 48:49.065
Welcome.
Tell you a little bit about ourselves.

48:49.150 --> 48:51.985
We are a sanctioned
after-school activity,

48:52.069 --> 48:56.114
one rung below the Glee Club,
two above Nintendo Wii Fit.

48:56.198 --> 49:00.410
And (chuckles) let me just say
to our guest, Sidney Prescott,

49:00.494 --> 49:01.995
it's an honor.

49:02.079 --> 49:04.497
(applause)

49:04.582 --> 49:07.292
Beyond Jamie Lee Curtis,
forget Linda Blair.

49:07.376 --> 49:09.586
I mean, this is the ultimate.

49:09.670 --> 49:11.296
Thanks. I guess.

49:11.380 --> 49:13.882
Um this,
you film your entire

49:13.966 --> 49:16.134
high school experience and,
what, post it on the net?

49:16.218 --> 49:18.094
Everybody'll be doing it someday, Sid.

49:18.179 --> 49:20.930
It's kind of the one component
the killer is missing.

49:21.015 --> 49:22.932
Wait.
What do you mean?

49:23.017 --> 49:25.018
Well, if you wanna be
the new new version,

49:25.102 --> 49:27.353
the killer
should be filming the murders.

49:27.438 --> 49:30.482
It's like the natural next step
in a psycho slasher innovation.

49:30.566 --> 49:33.068
I mean, you film 'em all real-time,
and then before you get caught,

49:33.152 --> 49:36.446
- you upload 'em into cyberspace.
- Making your art as immortal as you.

49:36.530 --> 49:39.574
- Not to implicate him.
- Not to implicate me.

49:39.658 --> 49:41.576
So who do you think
is behind the murders?

49:41.660 --> 49:45.413
(beep)
Well, it's a "Stab" fanatic clearly.

49:45.498 --> 49:48.249
Working on less of a shriekquel and...
and more of a scream-make.

49:48.334 --> 49:50.794
- Copyrighted terms, by the way.
- 'Cause all there are now are remakes.

49:50.878 --> 49:53.338
Only horror the studios green-light.
I mean

49:53.422 --> 49:54.589
- Psst.
- There are still rules.

49:54.673 --> 49:57.801
But the rules have changed.
The unexpected is the new clichÃ©.

49:57.885 --> 50:00.762
Yeah, you gotta have an opening sequence
that blows the doors off,

50:00.846 --> 50:02.931
dial up some flashy
music-video direction,

50:03.015 --> 50:04.724
and the kills gotta be
way more extreme.

50:04.809 --> 50:07.852
Modern audiences get savvy
to the rules of the originals.

50:07.937 --> 50:09.771
So the reversals
become the new standard.

50:09.855 --> 50:13.316
In fact, the only surefire way
to survive a modern horror movie?

50:13.400 --> 50:17.987
You pretty much have to be gay.
(light chuckling)

50:18.072 --> 50:22.033
So why are you so sure that the killer's
working by the rules of a horror remake?

50:22.118 --> 50:24.410
Well, the original "Stab" structure
is pretty apparent.

50:24.495 --> 50:26.955
Yeah, two kids killed in a house
when their parents are away?

50:27.039 --> 50:29.749
And then the school's hot chick
savaged beyond recognition.

50:29.834 --> 50:32.168
- We all know where it goes from there.
- A party.

50:32.253 --> 50:35.255
Exactly. A party.

50:35.339 --> 50:37.465
Guaranteed third-act
main cast bloodbath.

50:37.550 --> 50:39.425
Fingers crossed
on some nudity for a change.

50:39.510 --> 50:41.594
(light laughter)

50:41.679 --> 50:44.180
Okay, so do you know of a party
that's happening tonight?

50:44.265 --> 50:47.725
Well, there's Stab-a-Thon.

50:47.810 --> 50:49.894
Stab-a-Thon?

50:49.979 --> 50:52.313
Uh, it's a movie marathon.
All seven "Stabs" back-to-back.

50:52.398 --> 50:55.066
- We do it every year.
- And it's tonight?

50:55.151 --> 50:57.110
(scoffs) There's a killer out there

50:57.194 --> 50:59.362
patterning his murders
after the original movie.

50:59.446 --> 51:00.947
I know.
It's pretty wild.

51:01.031 --> 51:04.617
- Well, you have to call it off.
- Um, okay, I mean, it's Friday.

51:04.702 --> 51:07.829
I'm sure we're not the only party
that's goin' on in Woodsboro.

51:07.913 --> 51:09.956
Where is this circle jerk
gonna take place?

51:10.040 --> 51:14.377
- So who's ready for this Q and A?
- No, no. I really want the location.

51:14.461 --> 51:16.379
You know,
it's kind of an underground thing.

51:16.463 --> 51:18.173
Email invites, pretty secret.

51:18.257 --> 51:20.383
(chuckles)
What, you're not gonna tell me?

51:20.467 --> 51:22.093
Really?

51:22.178 --> 51:25.889
We're working together.
Remember?

51:25.973 --> 51:27.849
(swallows)
So you ready for that Q and A?

51:27.933 --> 51:31.644
- Fuck you.
- Let's go.

51:31.729 --> 51:34.147
(door opens, closes)

51:34.231 --> 51:35.982
(chuckles softly)
That was awesome.

51:36.066 --> 51:37.483
(talking indistinctly)

51:37.568 --> 51:41.279
(sighs)
I feel like I'm under house arrest.

51:55.836 --> 52:00.048
You know when people say,
"I know how you feel,"

52:00.132 --> 52:03.176
but you know they're just saying that
because they really have

52:03.260 --> 52:05.845
no frigging idea how you feel?

52:08.390 --> 52:11.935
I know how you feel.

52:12.019 --> 52:16.522
I... am so sorry about Olivia.

52:21.278 --> 52:23.613
I'm sorry about your publicist.

52:28.410 --> 52:33.248
How do you handle it?
People staring at you all the time?

52:33.332 --> 52:35.625
People stare at me?

52:35.709 --> 52:37.335
(both chuckle)

52:37.419 --> 52:39.587
I could never handle
that kind of attention.

52:39.672 --> 52:45.426
I just... feel like it would take over
your whole life.

52:45.511 --> 52:48.429
Uh...

52:48.514 --> 52:50.932
what I do is I...

52:51.016 --> 52:55.728
try not to think about me.

52:55.813 --> 53:00.483
I have people I care about.
I focus on them.

53:00.567 --> 53:03.778
And the rest, it, um,
it works out.

53:06.824 --> 53:09.575
You saved my life last night.

53:09.660 --> 53:13.454
I mean, I know we're family,
but you hardly know me.

53:13.539 --> 53:15.373
Makes me wonder, you know,

53:15.457 --> 53:19.711
if I'd have been brave enough
to do the same thing.

53:19.795 --> 53:23.089
I really hope
you never have to find that out.

53:26.927 --> 53:29.929
Well, if you need me,
you know where to find me.

53:30.014 --> 53:33.308
I'll be up in my cell.
Or, I mean, my room.

53:57.249 --> 54:01.252
Her room's all boarded up.
That's the view from my cell.

54:01.337 --> 54:03.713
(sighs) It's really weird.

54:03.797 --> 54:05.340
(Kirby) I think Olivia
would understand, okay?

54:05.424 --> 54:07.592
She'd want me to be
around other people.

54:07.676 --> 54:09.510
Holy shit.

54:09.595 --> 54:12.347
Even if I did just crash-land
on Planet Dork.

54:12.431 --> 54:15.558
Speaking of which,
Trevor's here.

54:15.642 --> 54:17.143
Hey, Kirby.

54:17.227 --> 54:19.520
What is he doing there?
That is so not his scene.

54:19.605 --> 54:22.315
I have no idea.
Maybe he thought you would be here.

54:22.399 --> 54:24.525
Yeah, fat chance.
After what happened last night?

54:24.610 --> 54:27.070
I mean, my mom
is just completely freaked out.

54:27.154 --> 54:28.571
- It's not pretty.
- All right, look.

54:28.655 --> 54:31.657
You go do your "good girl" thing,
and I will drink for the both of us.

54:31.742 --> 54:36.371
- I will keep you posted.
- All right. Be safe.

54:36.455 --> 54:39.290
(rock music playing,
indistinct conversations)

55:15.619 --> 55:19.080
(crowd chanting in unison) Stab-a-thon!
Stab-a-thon! Stab-a-thon!

55:19.164 --> 55:22.166
Stab-a-thon! Stab-a-thon!

55:22.251 --> 55:24.627
(cheers and applause)

55:24.711 --> 55:27.130
Thank you! Thank you!
Gracias.

55:27.214 --> 55:29.257
Shh.

55:29.341 --> 55:32.969
Cinema Club thanks you for coming out
for our third annual Stab-a-thon.

55:33.053 --> 55:34.637
(cheers and applause)
Safety in numbers, my friends!

55:34.721 --> 55:37.432
Who's ready to drink every time
someone can't get a cell phone signal?

55:37.516 --> 55:38.891
(cheers and applause)

55:38.976 --> 55:41.811
Who's ready to drink every time
someone shuts the refrigerator door,

55:41.895 --> 55:44.230
and oh, my God, there's a harmless
character right behind it?

55:44.314 --> 55:46.149
(hooting and cheering)

55:46.233 --> 55:48.734
Who's ready to drink every time
someone screams the word...

55:48.819 --> 55:50.236
(all) No!

55:50.320 --> 55:53.197
So let's get
this Stab-a-thon started!

55:53.282 --> 55:55.450
(cheers and applause)

55:55.534 --> 55:57.660
(eerie music plays)

55:59.705 --> 56:08.337
(cheers and applause)

56:08.422 --> 56:11.883
- Hey, watch it!
- Get out of the way!

56:11.967 --> 56:15.970
- Down in front!
- Move your ass!

56:16.305 --> 56:21.225
- Screw you!
(angry shouting)

56:21.310 --> 56:24.437
(dramatic music playing,
audience hooting)

56:38.994 --> 56:41.078
(glass shatters,
audience cheering)

56:54.176 --> 56:56.636
(softly) Yes.

56:56.720 --> 57:00.389
(thunder crashes,
audience cheers)

57:00.474 --> 57:04.519
Oh, yeah.
Back on my game.

57:04.603 --> 57:06.729
(exhales) Perfect.

57:06.813 --> 57:09.524
New work-in-progress,
chapter one.

57:09.608 --> 57:13.236
When I moved to Woodsboro,
I never in a million years dreamed

57:13.320 --> 57:16.531
that I would again play
the critical role

57:16.615 --> 57:19.534
in solving another series of these...

57:19.618 --> 57:21.244
What?

57:27.125 --> 57:29.210
What the hell?

57:49.147 --> 57:51.774
(cell phone rings)

57:51.858 --> 57:53.568
Gale, where are you?

57:53.652 --> 57:55.945
I followed the kids
to the Stab-a-thon.

57:56.029 --> 57:59.073
There's an old abandoned farm
on Fort Dillon Road.

57:59.157 --> 58:00.575
Listen, I've got it
under surveillance,

58:00.659 --> 58:02.994
and I-I think the killer's
about to make his move.

58:03.078 --> 58:04.704
What makes you so sure?

58:04.788 --> 58:07.665
You do a remake
to out-do the original,

58:07.749 --> 58:09.375
that's what the kids said.

58:09.459 --> 58:11.419
This party
is all about the "Stab" movies.

58:11.503 --> 58:13.838
Come on!
How meta can you get?

58:13.922 --> 58:16.007
How "what-a" can you get?

58:16.091 --> 58:18.134
I don't know.
I heard them say it.

58:18.218 --> 58:21.178
Dewey, listen to me,
you have to get out here.

58:21.263 --> 58:23.264
Come on, you catch the killer,
I get the story.

58:23.348 --> 58:24.515
It's a win-win.

58:24.600 --> 58:27.101
Well, I thought you were going rogue,
Gale.

58:27.185 --> 58:30.187
Oh, co... are you serious?
Come on!

58:30.272 --> 58:33.274
(exhales) Forget it.
Thanks for having faith in me.

58:33.358 --> 58:35.359
I gotta fix my equipment.
(beep)

58:35.444 --> 58:36.652
Gale!

58:39.031 --> 58:40.156
Shit.

58:40.240 --> 58:43.367
(siren wails)

58:47.372 --> 58:49.582
(man) Why don't you get
more comfortable, baby?!

58:49.666 --> 58:52.460
(light cheering)

58:52.544 --> 58:54.503
(cheers and applause)

58:54.588 --> 58:57.798
Bravo.
Well... very well done.

58:57.883 --> 58:59.717
Very, I'm very impressed.

58:59.801 --> 59:03.054
I mean, kind... kind of impressed.
Not really.

59:03.138 --> 59:04.305
- That'll do.
- Yeah?

59:04.389 --> 59:05.806
- Yeah.
- Yeah, she wants it, right?

59:05.891 --> 59:09.018
(telephone rings)

59:09.102 --> 59:12.813
(audience groans)

59:12.898 --> 59:15.608
(cheers and applause)
Ghostface! Yeah!

59:15.692 --> 59:17.777
(ringing continues)

59:20.572 --> 59:21.781
(woman) Don't answer it!

59:23.867 --> 59:27.453
- Hello?
- (Ghostface) Hello.

59:27.537 --> 59:28.996
Who is this?

59:29.081 --> 59:30.748
(audience talking along)
Were you expecting somebody?

59:30.832 --> 59:32.208
No.

59:36.380 --> 59:39.590
(indistinct radio chatter)

59:39.675 --> 59:41.634
(audience talking along)
You know, I don't even know you,

59:41.718 --> 59:43.135
and I dislike you already.

59:43.220 --> 59:45.513
Hicks, how far are you
from Fort Dillon Road?

59:45.597 --> 59:48.015
- Five minutes at the most, sir.
- Well, step on it.

59:48.100 --> 59:49.975
(tense music playing)

59:50.060 --> 59:51.894
Look out your window.

59:51.978 --> 59:54.605
(audience screaming)

01:00:14.042 --> 01:00:16.460
(camera whirring)

01:00:36.732 --> 01:00:39.775
Gale!
Gale, behind you!

01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:41.152
Aah!

01:00:41.236 --> 01:00:43.487
(grunts)
(audience cheering)

01:00:51.413 --> 01:00:52.830
Aah!

01:00:52.914 --> 01:00:55.583
(grunts)

01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:57.626
Gale!

01:00:59.713 --> 01:01:01.797
(woman onscreen screaming)

01:01:09.306 --> 01:01:11.849
Aah!

01:01:11.933 --> 01:01:13.142
Freeze!

01:01:16.521 --> 01:01:18.147
Aaah!

01:01:18.231 --> 01:01:20.024
(Gale grunts)

01:01:23.153 --> 01:01:26.822
(audience screaming)

01:01:26.907 --> 01:01:29.617
Get out of the way,
you morons!

01:01:33.455 --> 01:01:35.664
Damn it.

01:01:38.043 --> 01:01:40.836
Okay, put pressure on that.

01:01:40.921 --> 01:01:42.797
Did you catch him?

01:01:42.881 --> 01:01:45.216
No. Hopefully your cameras
caught something.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:47.802
- They weren't the only ones Dewey.
- What?

01:01:47.886 --> 01:01:50.262
There's a webcam that's hidden
up there.

01:01:50.347 --> 01:01:53.474
- It was watching me.
- A webcam?

01:01:53.558 --> 01:01:55.351
He's recording the murders.

01:01:55.435 --> 01:01:56.602
What?

01:01:56.686 --> 01:02:00.189
This time...
he's making the movie.

01:02:04.402 --> 01:02:09.365
Sidney Prescott detail, man.
I don't... like it.

01:02:09.449 --> 01:02:12.952
The cops guarding the house,
they always get it.

01:02:13.036 --> 01:02:15.871
- What are you talkin' about?
- It's a movie cop rule.

01:02:15.956 --> 01:02:19.458
Sucks to be a cop in a movie,
unless you're Bruce Willis.

01:02:19.543 --> 01:02:21.544
Not all cops die in movies.

01:02:21.628 --> 01:02:26.173
No, but if it's your last day
before retirement, you do.

01:02:26.258 --> 01:02:30.052
If you're a rookie just found out
your wife is pregnant, you do.

01:02:30.136 --> 01:02:33.931
Or if your partner's better-looking
than you, you do, and by the way...

01:02:34.015 --> 01:02:35.391
(both) I win that one.

01:02:35.475 --> 01:02:37.184
(chuckles)

01:02:37.269 --> 01:02:38.978
You know what?
I'll take the next perimeter.

01:02:39.062 --> 01:02:41.188
I'll be right back.

01:02:41.273 --> 01:02:45.359
Shit.
I know this one.

01:02:45.443 --> 01:02:47.069
You're not supposed to say that,
are you?

01:02:47.153 --> 01:02:48.529
Eh, new decade, new rules.

01:02:48.613 --> 01:02:51.365
You know, these days,
you might come back, find me dead,

01:02:51.449 --> 01:02:53.617
eyes gouged out,
tongue sticking out.

01:02:53.702 --> 01:02:56.036
- Could go either way.
- I gotta learn this shit.

01:02:56.121 --> 01:02:59.748
(chuckles) I'll take this one.

01:02:59.833 --> 01:03:02.001
Hey, Hoss.

01:03:02.085 --> 01:03:04.211
Be careful.

01:03:04.296 --> 01:03:06.213
I'm always careful.

01:03:09.759 --> 01:03:12.094
Dead man walking.

01:03:18.018 --> 01:03:21.061
(cat yowls, meows)

01:03:21.146 --> 01:03:23.230
(wind chimes tinkling)

01:04:01.519 --> 01:04:04.605
Perkins, was there a window open
on your last perimeter check?

01:04:07.651 --> 01:04:10.527
Perkins, come in, over.

01:04:10.612 --> 01:04:12.696
(dog barking in distance)

01:04:40.016 --> 01:04:42.685
(whispers) Anthony?

01:04:42.769 --> 01:04:46.105
Perkins?

01:04:46.189 --> 01:04:47.523
- Aaah!
- Ohh!

01:04:47.607 --> 01:04:50.651
- (laughs)
- Damn it.

01:04:50.735 --> 01:04:53.904
You should've seen the look
on your face, rookie.

01:04:53.989 --> 01:04:56.365
- (strangled grunt)
- Hoss!

01:04:56.449 --> 01:04:58.659
What the fuck? Aah!

01:04:58.743 --> 01:05:01.620
Oh, shit.

01:05:01.705 --> 01:05:03.789
(grunting)

01:05:18.471 --> 01:05:20.556
(dogs barking in distance)

01:05:28.815 --> 01:05:32.067
Fuck Bruce Willis.

01:05:35.613 --> 01:05:37.698
(wind chimes tinkling)

01:05:59.262 --> 01:06:02.806
Sorry!
The wind chimes were over here.

01:06:02.891 --> 01:06:05.934
That was me.
I was trying to fix 'em, sorry.

01:06:06.019 --> 01:06:08.312
I'm just back from the store.

01:06:08.396 --> 01:06:10.105
You're shopping?

01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:13.108
My stress buster.
Got one more bag in the car.

01:06:13.193 --> 01:06:14.610
Be right back.

01:06:26.081 --> 01:06:28.165
(telephone ringing)

01:06:40.762 --> 01:06:43.472
Jill?
You gonna get that?

01:06:45.767 --> 01:06:47.768
(beep)
Roberts residence.

01:06:47.852 --> 01:06:50.062
(Ghostface) You're a survivor,
aren't you, Sidney?

01:06:50.146 --> 01:06:53.273
Your one and only skill.
You survive.

01:06:53.358 --> 01:06:55.692
I have one question for you.

01:06:55.777 --> 01:06:58.570
What good's it to be a survivor
in this little drama

01:06:58.655 --> 01:07:00.864
if everyone close to you is dead?

01:07:00.949 --> 01:07:03.617
- Who are you?
- Turn on the TV to channel 6.

01:07:03.701 --> 01:07:05.244
Who the fuck are you?

01:07:05.328 --> 01:07:08.705
Turn it on.
Watch the teaser.

01:07:08.790 --> 01:07:12.584
...nearly turned deadly tonight
with the latest victims of these attacks

01:07:12.669 --> 01:07:16.255
being the wife of the Woodsboro sheriff,
Gale Riley,

01:07:16.339 --> 01:07:20.634
AKA Gale Weathers who's in serious
condition tonight after being stabbed.

01:07:20.718 --> 01:07:23.846
Her assailant then disappeared
in a sea of identic...

01:07:23.930 --> 01:07:27.516
(laughs) Glad you came home, Sidney?
Has it been worth it yet?

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.102
- Why are you doing this?
- Ah, friends count.

01:07:30.186 --> 01:07:33.522
But it's the family ties
that cut deep, right?

01:07:33.606 --> 01:07:35.232
Am I right?

01:07:35.316 --> 01:07:36.733
What do you mean?

01:07:36.818 --> 01:07:38.694
(chuckles)
The ones you care about most.

01:07:38.778 --> 01:07:42.239
And what's closer than family?
The bond of blood.

01:07:42.323 --> 01:07:44.533
- Don't.
- You can't save them.

01:07:44.617 --> 01:07:48.162
All you can do is watch.
(laughs)

01:07:48.246 --> 01:07:49.454
Jill!

01:07:59.924 --> 01:08:02.009
Come on, come on...

01:08:07.849 --> 01:08:09.141
Kate?

01:08:09.225 --> 01:08:10.934
- Sid?
- Jill's not in her room.

01:08:11.019 --> 01:08:12.477
- Oh, my God.
- She's gone to Kirby's.

01:08:12.562 --> 01:08:13.937
You gotta call her
and get her back here.

01:08:14.022 --> 01:08:16.273
Okay.
(beep)

01:08:16.357 --> 01:08:17.608
(telephone rings)
Come on, Jill.

01:08:17.692 --> 01:08:20.027
- Leave a message.
- She's not picking up.

01:08:20.111 --> 01:08:22.196
- What's going on?
- The killer called.

01:08:22.279 --> 01:08:24.656
He's coming after me,
but he wants my family first.

01:08:24.741 --> 01:08:26.533
- Oh, God, Jill!
- Let's get the cops.

01:08:26.618 --> 01:08:28.202
- The cops aren't there.
- What?

01:08:28.286 --> 01:08:30.578
They were there when I first came in,
but they're not there now.

01:08:30.662 --> 01:08:32.956
Let's get to Kirby's.

01:08:36.252 --> 01:08:37.461
Out the front.

01:08:40.965 --> 01:08:43.466
(gasps, screams)

01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:45.594
(both grunting)

01:08:45.678 --> 01:08:48.388
Brace it from the bottom.
Can you?

01:08:53.144 --> 01:08:55.437
(pounding on door)
Let's get outta here.

01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:58.064
- (thud, grunts)
- (whispering) Kate, come on!

01:08:58.149 --> 01:08:59.608
Kate?

01:09:10.411 --> 01:09:14.081
Tell Jill... I'm so... sorry.

01:09:14.165 --> 01:09:16.291
Shh.

01:09:26.386 --> 01:09:28.470
Kate?

01:09:43.361 --> 01:09:46.154
Hicks?
What are you doing?

01:09:46.238 --> 01:09:48.823
I just saw somebody coming around
the side of the house.

01:09:48.908 --> 01:09:50.867
Where are Hoss and Perkins?
I couldn't get them on the radio.

01:09:50.952 --> 01:09:53.245
Whose blood is that?

01:09:53.328 --> 01:09:56.707
It's... it's Kate's.
We were just attacked.

01:09:56.791 --> 01:09:58.709
- She's dead.
- Where is she?

01:09:58.793 --> 01:10:00.836
- Front door.
- Show me.

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.962
Okay.

01:10:06.092 --> 01:10:08.677
- Stay here.
- Okay.

01:10:13.182 --> 01:10:15.350
(radio clicks)
This is Deputy Hicks.

01:10:15.435 --> 01:10:17.686
I've got a homicide
at the Roberts residence.

01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:20.689
- No sign of Perkins or Hoss.
- Copy that, we'll try to locate them.

01:10:20.773 --> 01:10:24.067
I'm so sorry...

01:10:24.152 --> 01:10:26.361
(tires squealing)

01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:30.907
Hey!

01:10:30.992 --> 01:10:33.535
Halt!

01:10:33.619 --> 01:10:37.247
You're gonna be fine, all right?
I swear.

01:10:37.332 --> 01:10:38.957
No more "on your own."

01:10:39.042 --> 01:10:40.667
It's you and me, forever.

01:10:40.752 --> 01:10:43.003
One, two, three.
(grunts)

01:10:43.087 --> 01:10:45.213
Easy.

01:10:45.298 --> 01:10:47.341
- Dewey?
- Yeah?

01:10:47.425 --> 01:10:50.385
Promise me somethin'.

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:51.553
Anything.

01:10:51.637 --> 01:10:54.931
(exhales)
Catch that motherfucker.

01:10:55.016 --> 01:10:57.893
Absolutely.
I love you.

01:10:57.977 --> 01:11:00.145
I love you.

01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:04.399
You missed chaos.
Utter chaos.

01:11:04.484 --> 01:11:07.444
- I can't believe that.
- The sheriff's wife, man!

01:11:07.528 --> 01:11:09.571
She told us to cancel it,
and we didn't, and now this?

01:11:09.655 --> 01:11:11.365
- What are we supposed to do?
- Robbie, calm down.

01:11:11.449 --> 01:11:13.950
It makes sense.
This is what the re-boots do.

01:11:14.035 --> 01:11:15.744
They... they one-up the original ending.

01:11:15.828 --> 01:11:18.997
The Woodsboro Murders ended at a party.
So in the remake...

01:11:19.082 --> 01:11:21.708
The party's the false ending.
New rules.

01:11:21.793 --> 01:11:23.668
Exactly.

01:11:23.753 --> 01:11:26.004
Okay, no offense, guys,
but I'm gonna put in "Stab 7."

01:11:26.089 --> 01:11:28.799
- Nobody cancels my film festival.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:11:28.883 --> 01:11:31.009
I don't wanna watch that,
not after what happened to Olivia.

01:11:31.094 --> 01:11:33.261
Oh, come on,
it was her favorite.

01:11:33.346 --> 01:11:36.431
Oh, wow, Kirby.
You got some classics here.

01:11:36.516 --> 01:11:38.975
- Yup.
- "Suspiria," "Don't Look Now."

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.602
You know it.

01:11:40.686 --> 01:11:43.063
I could trivia your ass under the table,
Cinema Boy.

01:11:43.147 --> 01:11:45.982
Oh, yeah?
Who played Leatherface first?

01:11:46.067 --> 01:11:50.654
- Gunnar Hansen.
- Wow. Did you feel that?

01:11:50.738 --> 01:11:53.490
That charge that moved between us
just then?

01:11:53.574 --> 01:11:56.618
Oh, that was me.
I have powers.

01:11:56.702 --> 01:11:58.286
So sexy.

01:11:58.371 --> 01:12:01.706
You guys are unbelievable.
You're playing fuckin' trivia games?

01:12:01.791 --> 01:12:04.418
The cops are gonna come for us. They're
gonna shut down my website.

01:12:04.502 --> 01:12:06.253
- We're so dead!
- Yeah. I agree.

01:12:06.337 --> 01:12:09.381
- Jesus Christ, where'd you come from?
- The front door.

01:12:09.465 --> 01:12:11.508
By the way, Kirby, with everything
that's going on right now,

01:12:11.592 --> 01:12:14.636
you probably shouldn't
leave that unlocked.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.513
Sorry.

01:12:16.597 --> 01:12:20.100
And, um, may I ask
what the hell you're doing here?

01:12:20.184 --> 01:12:22.894
What?
Didn't I find the after-party?

01:12:22.979 --> 01:12:25.897
No, you found the anti-party,
and it's invitation only.

01:12:25.982 --> 01:12:29.192
Yeah, well, I got an invitation.
From Jill.

01:12:31.362 --> 01:12:35.407
- So, what's the story?
- W-What?

01:12:35.491 --> 01:12:39.911
You sent me a text message.
"After-party at Kirby's house."

01:12:39.996 --> 01:12:44.458
- I mean, it was from your phone.
- What do you mean from my phone?

01:12:44.542 --> 01:12:47.586
Where is my phone?
I think I left it in your car.

01:12:47.670 --> 01:12:52.174
I didn't text him.
(sighs) I didn't text you.

01:12:52.258 --> 01:12:54.759
And I'll prove it.

01:12:54.844 --> 01:12:57.721
So, Charlie, Robbie.

01:12:57.805 --> 01:13:00.849
How's it feel to be an accessories
to a crime, huh?

01:13:00.933 --> 01:13:03.351
I mean, really, Dewey's wife?

01:13:03.436 --> 01:13:04.561
My life is over.

01:13:04.645 --> 01:13:07.606
So which one of you guys sent me
a text message from Jill's phone, huh?

01:13:07.690 --> 01:13:09.316
(snorts, coughs)

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:13.028
We're just supposed to accept
that you're telling the truth?

01:13:13.112 --> 01:13:16.198
Isn't your phone missing?

01:13:16.282 --> 01:13:18.533
- Got a new one.
- Really.

01:13:18.618 --> 01:13:22.120
Oh,
that's incredibly convenient.

01:13:22.205 --> 01:13:24.414
- Dewey, it's Hicks.
- What's up?

01:13:24.499 --> 01:13:27.083
- Kate Roberts is dead.
- Huh?

01:13:27.168 --> 01:13:29.002
- And Sidney fled the scene.

01:13:29.086 --> 01:13:31.254
What?
What happened to Kate?

01:13:31.339 --> 01:13:33.340
She was stabbed just like the others.

01:13:33.424 --> 01:13:36.301
- What about Jill?
- No sign of her at all.

01:13:36.385 --> 01:13:38.553
Where the hell
were Hoss and Perkins?

01:13:38.638 --> 01:13:41.556
They were found dead
in their car two blocks away.

01:13:41.641 --> 01:13:45.101
(sighs) Multiple stab wounds.

01:13:45.186 --> 01:13:47.145
Okay.

01:13:47.230 --> 01:13:48.939
I'm on my way.

01:13:49.023 --> 01:13:50.565
Yes, sir.

01:13:55.363 --> 01:13:57.239
(siren wails)

01:13:57.323 --> 01:14:00.367
Wrong number.
(beep)

01:14:00.451 --> 01:14:02.244
- Who was that?
- Oh, nobody.

01:14:02.328 --> 01:14:05.413
- Did you pick a movie?
- Yeah. We're gonna go scary.

01:14:05.498 --> 01:14:08.041
- "Saw 4."
- Ugh, I saw that in theaters.

01:14:08.125 --> 01:14:10.418
It sucks.
It's not scary, it's gross...

01:14:10.503 --> 01:14:11.962
(groans)

01:14:12.046 --> 01:14:14.005
(sighs)

01:14:34.318 --> 01:14:35.944
(groans)

01:14:36.028 --> 01:14:38.363
Charlie, you want to sit
over here next to me?

01:14:38.447 --> 01:14:40.824
(chuckles softly)
All right.

01:14:43.869 --> 01:14:45.412
(beep)

01:14:45.496 --> 01:14:51.501
All right, get ready for a "Hall Pass"
with Robbie Mercer extra.

01:14:51.586 --> 01:14:55.922
Now tonight, there is a good chance
that Charlie Walker,

01:14:56.007 --> 01:15:00.677
yes, my Charlie Walker,
may get lucky with a girl.

01:15:00.761 --> 01:15:05.682
Now I'm unable to, uh,
divulge my exact location, however,

01:15:05.766 --> 01:15:12.522
suffice it to say, Woodsboro High
may be in store for some geek history.

01:15:12.607 --> 01:15:16.359
We'll see.

01:15:16.444 --> 01:15:19.404
(clears throat)

01:15:19.488 --> 01:15:21.906
(distant thud)

01:15:28.164 --> 01:15:29.205
Hello?

01:15:32.126 --> 01:15:33.877
Who's there?

01:15:39.008 --> 01:15:40.967
Oh, my God...

01:15:54.565 --> 01:15:57.609
- Where are you going?
- To make sure the front door is locked.

01:15:57.693 --> 01:15:59.486
(doorbell rings, both scream)

01:15:59.570 --> 01:16:01.988
No. Don't open it...

01:16:05.034 --> 01:16:08.203
- (whispering) Hey, Charlie?
- Yeah?

01:16:08.287 --> 01:16:12.582
I'm sorry, I know you're into
the movie and all,

01:16:12.667 --> 01:16:15.627
but now would be a really good time
to make a move.

01:16:16.962 --> 01:16:19.506
For... me to make a move?

01:16:19.590 --> 01:16:21.466
Mm-hmm.

01:16:21.550 --> 01:16:24.469
Couldn't you make a move?

01:16:24.553 --> 01:16:26.721
I just did.

01:16:26.806 --> 01:16:30.266
'Cause you're actually pretty cute.

01:16:30.351 --> 01:16:36.106
Especially when I'm scared and...
Ionely... and drunk.

01:16:39.026 --> 01:16:42.487
Hey, guys, did...
did you see Jill come in?

01:16:42.571 --> 01:16:44.656
I didn't see her outside.

01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:47.158
Yes, Trevor, she is upstairs.

01:16:47.243 --> 01:16:50.870
Thank God you're here to protect her
when you can't even find her.

01:16:50.955 --> 01:16:53.456
There's nobody out here.

01:16:53.541 --> 01:16:56.543
(chuckles) Oh, dude,
I love this part of the movie.

01:16:56.627 --> 01:16:58.294
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:16:58.379 --> 01:17:02.716
Just when you think they're all safe
and comfortable in the house...

01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.884
Ghostface comes in,
and, bam!

01:17:08.973 --> 01:17:11.558
Did I just interrupt something
right here?

01:17:11.642 --> 01:17:15.729
Shut the fuck up.
(chuckles)

01:17:15.813 --> 01:17:17.981
Who invited you, Trevor?!

01:17:18.065 --> 01:17:21.526
(chuckling) All right.
Clearly not you.

01:17:21.610 --> 01:17:25.321
Wow. I'm gonna be upstairs.
(exhales sharply)

01:17:25.406 --> 01:17:28.032
Get out of my house!

01:17:30.161 --> 01:17:32.579
Yeah, yeah.

01:17:32.663 --> 01:17:36.332
Okay, I'm a little drunk,
so don't blame your internet connection.

01:17:36.417 --> 01:17:40.170
(chuckles) Let's see
what Charlie's up to, shall we?

01:17:40.254 --> 01:17:43.423
Or the saga of Trevor and Jill.

01:17:43.507 --> 01:17:45.341
Oh,
the intrigue of Woodsboro High.

01:17:45.426 --> 01:17:47.927
Who needs a killer around
when there's so much drama?

01:18:00.858 --> 01:18:03.735
(chuckles) Oh, man.

01:18:06.572 --> 01:18:07.989
That's better.

01:18:11.911 --> 01:18:13.161
(gasps) Aah!

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.375
Agh!

01:18:22.546 --> 01:18:25.173
Wait, no, you can't!
You can't! There's rules!

01:18:25.257 --> 01:18:27.258
I-I'm gay! I'm gay!

01:18:27.343 --> 01:18:30.261
I mean, if it helps.

01:18:30.346 --> 01:18:32.514
(grunts)

01:18:36.769 --> 01:18:38.937
...random girl who gets a call

01:18:39.021 --> 01:18:40.522
that undoubtedly ends up
getting her killed.

01:18:40.606 --> 01:18:42.857
It's all so predictable.
There's no element of surprise.

01:18:42.942 --> 01:18:44.400
You can see ev...

01:18:58.541 --> 01:18:59.791
Kirby!

01:18:59.875 --> 01:19:02.126
I found my phone.
It was up in your room.

01:19:02.211 --> 01:19:04.212
There was no text message
sent to Trevor.

01:19:04.296 --> 01:19:08.716
He is such a liar.
Where is he?

01:19:08.801 --> 01:19:12.053
What do you mean where is he?
He just went upstairs looking for you.

01:19:12.137 --> 01:19:15.056
He's not upstairs.

01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:16.432
Trevor?

01:19:18.727 --> 01:19:21.563
Charlie? Robbie?

01:19:21.647 --> 01:19:23.857
Maybe they're outside.

01:19:23.941 --> 01:19:25.149
- (screams)
- Jill.

01:19:25.234 --> 01:19:27.360
Sidney, I-I'm sorry, I should've told
you and Mom where I was going...

01:19:27.444 --> 01:19:29.696
No, it's okay. It's just,
I-I need you to come with me,

01:19:29.780 --> 01:19:31.990
- Come with me right now, okay?
- (gasps)

01:19:32.074 --> 01:19:34.242
Run.

01:19:34.326 --> 01:19:36.035
Robbie!

01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:39.289
(screaming)

01:19:39.373 --> 01:19:40.582
Go!

01:19:42.751 --> 01:19:46.170
- Sidney!
- (grunts)

01:19:46.255 --> 01:19:47.463
Come on!

01:19:50.843 --> 01:19:53.428
- The balcony!
- There's no other way out?

01:19:53.512 --> 01:19:56.055
We can jump.
(thudding, wood cracking)

01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:58.600
It's two stories.
Where's your cell?

01:19:58.684 --> 01:19:59.934
- Uh, here.
- Get under the bed!

01:20:00.019 --> 01:20:01.853
- What?
- Just do what I say! Get under the bed.

01:20:01.937 --> 01:20:03.730
Don't make a sound and don't come out
until I come get you, okay?

01:20:03.814 --> 01:20:05.940
- Just trust me.
- Okay.

01:20:13.032 --> 01:20:15.950
You got it? You're okay?
Jill, run!

01:20:16.035 --> 01:20:18.036
Just keep running, get help!

01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:31.132
(telephone dialing)

01:20:31.216 --> 01:20:34.385
(telephone ringing)

01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:36.137
(grunts)

01:20:42.853 --> 01:20:44.395
- (click) Hello?
- Dewey!

01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.689
- Sidney, where are you?
- I'm at Kirby's.

01:20:46.774 --> 01:20:48.274
The killer is here.
I need your help.

01:20:48.359 --> 01:20:50.276
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.

01:20:50.361 --> 01:20:52.612
(grunts)

01:20:52.696 --> 01:20:54.781
Sidney? Sidney!

01:20:54.865 --> 01:20:57.617
I need all units to 329
Whispering Lane.

01:20:57.701 --> 01:21:00.078
All units,
329 Whispering Lane!

01:21:07.711 --> 01:21:10.463
(sirens wailing)

01:21:20.140 --> 01:21:21.224
Sorry. It's just me.

01:21:21.308 --> 01:21:23.726
Look, I tried to call 911,
but the landline's dead,

01:21:23.811 --> 01:21:26.396
- and someone smashed the router
- I think I got through on my cell.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:28.606
Where's Jill?
(footsteps overhead)

01:21:28.691 --> 01:21:31.818
Oh, God.
Go, go, go, go.

01:21:31.902 --> 01:21:34.737
(lock clicks)

01:21:34.822 --> 01:21:37.615
There's a room down here.
We can lock ourselves in.

01:21:37.700 --> 01:21:39.993
I heard you yelling to Jill.
Did she get away?

01:21:40.077 --> 01:21:41.619
I think she's safe.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.250
(lock clicks)

01:21:47.334 --> 01:21:49.002
(thudding)

01:21:49.086 --> 01:21:52.547
- Kirby, let me in!
- Charlie.

01:21:52.631 --> 01:21:55.550
No.
No, no, no, no.

01:21:55.634 --> 01:21:57.593
I just found Robbie.
This... this is his blood.

01:21:57.678 --> 01:22:00.346
Please. Please.
There is someone else out here.

01:22:00.431 --> 01:22:01.514
Let me in!

01:22:01.598 --> 01:22:03.558
If you can't trust him,
don't open the door.

01:22:03.642 --> 01:22:06.728
My God, let me in!

01:22:06.812 --> 01:22:08.146
Get away from the door,
Charlie.

01:22:08.230 --> 01:22:10.273
Kirby, it is me.
Please let me in!

01:22:10.357 --> 01:22:12.442
Get away from the door,
Charlie.

01:22:12.526 --> 01:22:14.819
It's me!

01:22:14.903 --> 01:22:17.655
(voice breaking) I'm sorry,
I can't.

01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:21.075
- What the fuck?!
- (whispers) I'm sorry.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.952
Behind you! Look out!

01:22:23.037 --> 01:22:24.328
(grunts)

01:22:24.413 --> 01:22:26.414
(gasps)

01:22:26.498 --> 01:22:28.166
No! No, no, no!

01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:31.002
(blows landing) Kirby!

01:22:34.173 --> 01:22:37.967
(sirens wailing)

01:22:41.555 --> 01:22:43.723
Oh, God, no, please.
(pounds on door)

01:22:43.807 --> 01:22:46.976
Leave him alone!

01:22:47.061 --> 01:22:49.395
(cell phone ringing)

01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:52.482
It's Charlie's phone.

01:22:52.566 --> 01:22:56.069
(Ghostface) Tell Sidney heads
are gonna roll tonight.

01:22:56.153 --> 01:22:57.904
Tell Sidney
it's all because of her.

01:22:57.988 --> 01:23:02.658
Or maybe she wants to take his place.
I promise to be quick.

01:23:02.743 --> 01:23:04.952
- It's him.
- Okay, okay. I'm gonna get Jill.

01:23:05.037 --> 01:23:07.246
We should be in the same place.
Just... just keep him on the phone.

01:23:07.331 --> 01:23:10.666
I'll be right back, okay?

01:23:10.751 --> 01:23:13.086
Let him go, please.

01:23:13.170 --> 01:23:15.463
I hear you like horror movies,
Kirby.

01:23:15.547 --> 01:23:18.132
But do you like 'em
as much as him?

01:23:18.217 --> 01:23:21.302
Forget watching "Stab."
You get to live it.

01:23:21.386 --> 01:23:24.847
No, no, no, no, no!
He's the expert! It's not me!

01:23:24.932 --> 01:23:27.183
Warm-up question:
Jason's weapon?

01:23:27.267 --> 01:23:29.435
Uh, it's a machete.

01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:32.688
There, you see?
You do know the genre.

01:23:32.773 --> 01:23:35.733
- Michael Myers?
- Uh, butcher knife.

01:23:35.818 --> 01:23:38.611
- Leatherface?
- A chainsaw. Please!

01:23:38.695 --> 01:23:39.904
Just ask Sidney
if you need some help.

01:23:39.988 --> 01:23:42.490
- Freddy Krueger?!
- Uh, uh, razor hands.

01:23:42.574 --> 01:23:45.034
Name the movie that started
the slasher craze.

01:23:45.119 --> 01:23:47.954
"Halloween," "Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"
"Last House on the Left," or "Psycho"?

01:23:48.038 --> 01:23:50.623
- "Psycho"!
- None of the above!

01:23:50.707 --> 01:23:53.042
"Peeping Tom," 1960,
directed by Michael Powell.

01:23:53.127 --> 01:23:56.254
First movie to ever put the audience
in the killer's POV.

01:23:56.338 --> 01:23:58.506
What? Wait.
No, no, no.

01:23:58.590 --> 01:24:01.342
Please, just ask me one more question!
Just one more!

01:24:01.426 --> 01:24:03.719
All right, Kirby.

01:24:03.804 --> 01:24:07.140
Then it's time
for your last-chance question.

01:24:07.224 --> 01:24:12.103
Name the remake of the groundbreaking
horror movie in which the villain...

01:24:12.187 --> 01:24:14.856
Uh, "Halloween," uh, "Texas Chainsaw,"
"Dawn Of The Dead,"

01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:17.358
"The Hills Have Eyes,"
"Amityville Horror,"

01:24:17.442 --> 01:24:19.861
uh, "Last House On The Left,"
"Friday The Thirteenth,"

01:24:19.945 --> 01:24:22.280
"A Nightmare On Elm Street,"
"My Bloody Valentine,"

01:24:22.364 --> 01:24:25.408
"When A Stranger Calls,"
"Prom Night," "Black Christmas,"

01:24:25.492 --> 01:24:29.745
"House Of Wax," "The Fog,"
uh, "Piranha."

01:24:29.830 --> 01:24:32.707
It's one of those, right?
Right?

01:24:39.173 --> 01:24:41.549
(exhales) I got it right.

01:24:41.633 --> 01:24:43.509
I was fucking right.

01:24:43.594 --> 01:24:45.011
(whispers) Jill?

01:24:57.024 --> 01:24:59.442
I won, Charlie.
I fucking won.

01:24:59.526 --> 01:25:02.653
I won. He tried to beat me,
but I fucking won.

01:25:02.738 --> 01:25:04.697
Great, Kirby.

01:25:04.781 --> 01:25:08.826
Hold on.
Okay. Almost there.

01:25:08.911 --> 01:25:11.871
Just hang tight.
Okay. Okay.

01:25:11.955 --> 01:25:13.414
- All right.
- Kirby?

01:25:13.498 --> 01:25:15.208
- Yeah?
- This is making a move.

01:25:15.292 --> 01:25:18.711
(gasps)

01:25:18.795 --> 01:25:21.505
Four years of classes together,
and you notice me now?

01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:23.799
Stupid bitch!

01:25:23.884 --> 01:25:26.177
- It's too late!
- (grunting)

01:25:26.261 --> 01:25:27.845
Shh. Shh.

01:25:27.930 --> 01:25:30.056
Oh, I know, I know.

01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.016
It's okay.
Take your time.

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:34.435
Doesn't happen as fast
as it does in the movies, I know.

01:25:34.519 --> 01:25:37.897
C-Charlie... (gasping)

01:25:37.981 --> 01:25:39.815
Charlie...

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:42.485
(grunting)

01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.126
(door opens)

01:26:04.258 --> 01:26:05.591
Kirby?

01:26:09.096 --> 01:26:12.473
You know, you learn a lot when
you watch movies over and over.

01:26:12.557 --> 01:26:15.309
All the plots
are about trying to kill you.

01:26:15.394 --> 01:26:17.061
Where's Jill?

01:26:17.145 --> 01:26:19.355
Oh, you think
she's gonna get away?

01:26:19.439 --> 01:26:20.815
You think anyone gets away?

01:26:20.899 --> 01:26:22.900
(both grunt)

01:26:22.985 --> 01:26:24.819
(grunts)

01:26:24.903 --> 01:26:26.028
(gasps)

01:26:31.118 --> 01:26:34.203
- Jill?
- Hello, Sidney.

01:26:34.288 --> 01:26:35.371
Surprised?

01:26:35.455 --> 01:26:37.581
Watch this.

01:26:37.666 --> 01:26:44.171
This is the part, my dear cousin,
when the cameras turn off.

01:26:44.256 --> 01:26:47.300
(grunts)

01:26:47.384 --> 01:26:49.010
Charlie?

01:26:49.094 --> 01:26:50.678
Already taken care of.

01:26:50.762 --> 01:26:53.431
Man, I got great footage
of my Robbie kill.

01:26:53.515 --> 01:26:55.725
Better than Jenny
and Marnie or Olivia even.

01:26:55.809 --> 01:26:58.811
Good, we'll cut and upload it later
and make it all traceable to Trevor.

01:26:58.895 --> 01:27:00.521
Speaking of which...

01:27:03.442 --> 01:27:06.319
- Remind you of anything?
- Jill, please...

01:27:06.403 --> 01:27:08.154
Shut up! Dick.

01:27:08.238 --> 01:27:09.780
Everything I learned,
I learned from you.

01:27:09.865 --> 01:27:12.408
You think you had a shitty boyfriend,
Sidney?

01:27:12.492 --> 01:27:18.164
Here's one that fucks you, dumps you,
and doesn't even make you famous.

01:27:18.248 --> 01:27:21.208
Agh! What the fuck, Jill?
I loved you!

01:27:21.293 --> 01:27:23.669
Shut the fuck up already!

01:27:23.754 --> 01:27:25.838
Agh! Aagh!

01:27:25.922 --> 01:27:28.382
I'm sure those cops
would want you to have this, Jill.

01:27:28.467 --> 01:27:29.842
For your protection.

01:27:29.926 --> 01:27:31.552
No.

01:27:31.636 --> 01:27:36.223
Baby, please...
baby, please...

01:27:36.308 --> 01:27:38.601
Shouldn't have killed
all these people, Trev.

01:27:38.685 --> 01:27:40.978
Gone and put it on video even.

01:27:41.063 --> 01:27:43.147
But it means
a lot that you did it for me.

01:27:43.231 --> 01:27:45.358
What the fuck
are you talking about?!

01:27:45.442 --> 01:27:49.111
I am not the girl you cheat on.

01:27:49.196 --> 01:27:53.532
Aagh! Aaaagh!

01:27:53.617 --> 01:27:56.077
I've gone through everything.
We're definitely good on timeline.

01:27:56.161 --> 01:27:58.829
Oh, yeah.
We're perfect.

01:27:58.914 --> 01:28:01.332
No, no, no, please!

01:28:01.416 --> 01:28:04.877
- (gasps)
- You should keep quiet.

01:28:07.839 --> 01:28:09.965
Ready for act three?

01:28:10.050 --> 01:28:12.510
Got it figured out yet, Sidney?

01:28:12.594 --> 01:28:14.053
In keeping with our remake theme,

01:28:14.137 --> 01:28:16.764
Trevor's this generation's
Billy Loomis,

01:28:16.848 --> 01:28:20.101
and we're the innocent victims,
Sidney and Randy.

01:28:20.185 --> 01:28:23.771
See, with you, the world
just heard about what happened.

01:28:23.855 --> 01:28:26.816
- But with us, they're gonna see it.
- (screaming on video)

01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:30.778
It's gonna be a worldwide sensation.
I mean, people gotta see this shit.

01:28:30.862 --> 01:28:34.115
It's not like anyone reads anymore.

01:28:34.199 --> 01:28:40.579
We're gonna know fame
like you never even dreamed of.

01:28:40.664 --> 01:28:42.957
Last two teenagers standing.

01:28:43.041 --> 01:28:45.668
This time Randy gets the girl.

01:28:51.133 --> 01:28:54.009
You were amazing.
You're the perfect victim.

01:28:54.094 --> 01:28:57.680
I was so believable today,
wasn't I?

01:28:57.764 --> 01:29:02.268
I mean, I told so many lies
that I actually started to believe them.

01:29:02.352 --> 01:29:04.562
I really think
that I was born for this.

01:29:04.646 --> 01:29:06.355
How could you do this?

01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:11.527
Do you know what it was like
growing up in this family?

01:29:11.611 --> 01:29:13.946
Related to you?

01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:16.866
I mean, all I ever heard
was Sidney this

01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:20.202
and Sidney that
and Sidney, Sidney, Sidney.

01:29:20.287 --> 01:29:23.747
You were always
just so fucking special!

01:29:23.832 --> 01:29:25.583
Well,
now I'm the special one.

01:29:25.667 --> 01:29:27.918
You'll slip.
They always do.

01:29:28.003 --> 01:29:30.254
Hm. Come on, Charlie,
let's get on with this.

01:29:33.383 --> 01:29:37.720
You have to be strong.
And hold still, okay?

01:29:37.804 --> 01:29:41.182
Yeah. Yeah, old school,
like Billy and Stu.

01:29:41.266 --> 01:29:43.392
Come on, baby, get it up!

01:29:43.477 --> 01:29:47.021
Come on. Shoulder me!
Shoulder me! Shoulder me!

01:29:47.105 --> 01:29:48.939
Get it up! (grunts)

01:29:52.569 --> 01:29:55.905
The heart...
That's not the way we rehearsed it.

01:29:55.989 --> 01:29:59.617
You said it, Charlie.
Billy and Stu, Trevor and you.

01:29:59.701 --> 01:30:05.247
What the media really loves, baby,
is a sole survivor.

01:30:05.332 --> 01:30:07.500
Just ask you-know-who.

01:30:07.584 --> 01:30:12.296
Trevor was your partner.
But you, you were the idea man.

01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:13.881
(gasps)

01:30:21.765 --> 01:30:24.058
Even your friends.

01:30:24.142 --> 01:30:26.810
My friends?

01:30:26.895 --> 01:30:28.854
What world are you living in?

01:30:28.939 --> 01:30:30.689
I don't need friends.

01:30:30.774 --> 01:30:33.067
I need fans.

01:30:33.151 --> 01:30:34.568
Don't you get it?!

01:30:34.653 --> 01:30:38.280
This has never been
about killing you.

01:30:38.365 --> 01:30:41.408
It's about...
becoming you.

01:30:41.493 --> 01:30:44.203
I mean, for fuck's sake,
my own mother had to die...

01:30:44.287 --> 01:30:48.165
no great loss there...
so I could stay true to the original.

01:30:48.250 --> 01:30:50.167
That's sick, right?

01:30:50.252 --> 01:30:53.546
Well, sick is the new sane.

01:30:53.630 --> 01:30:55.297
You had your fifteen minutes.

01:30:55.382 --> 01:30:57.132
Now I want mine!

01:30:57.217 --> 01:31:00.719
I mean, what am I supposed to do?
Go to college?

01:31:00.804 --> 01:31:03.305
Grad school? Work?

01:31:03.390 --> 01:31:04.848
Look around.

01:31:04.933 --> 01:31:07.142
We all live in public now,
we're all on the Internet.

01:31:07.227 --> 01:31:10.479
How do you think people
become famous anymore?

01:31:10.564 --> 01:31:14.441
You don't have to achieve anything.

01:31:14.526 --> 01:31:17.695
You just gotta have
fucked-up shit happen to you.

01:31:17.779 --> 01:31:20.739
So, you do have to die, Sid.

01:31:20.824 --> 01:31:24.868
Those are the rules.
New movie, new franchise.

01:31:24.953 --> 01:31:27.621
There's only room for one lead,
and let's face it,

01:31:27.706 --> 01:31:30.708
your ingÃ©nue days,
they're over.

01:31:30.792 --> 01:31:33.294
(gasps)

01:31:37.048 --> 01:31:39.049
Don't tell me you didn't know
this day would come.

01:32:35.273 --> 01:32:37.149
(ripping)

01:32:37.233 --> 01:32:38.859
Aah!

01:32:56.044 --> 01:32:58.087
(screams)

01:32:58.171 --> 01:32:59.254
(gasps)

01:32:59.339 --> 01:33:01.632
Oh, fuck!

01:33:18.983 --> 01:33:21.777
(grunting)

01:33:47.387 --> 01:33:48.512
(groans)

01:33:57.689 --> 01:33:59.773
(sirens approaching)

01:34:21.212 --> 01:34:24.590
Come on, let's move it!

01:34:24.674 --> 01:34:27.092
(car doors closing)

01:34:31.139 --> 01:34:32.639
He's gone.

01:34:32.724 --> 01:34:35.642
Check the rooms,
both sides and upstairs.

01:34:35.727 --> 01:34:36.810
Yes, ma'am.

01:34:54.162 --> 01:34:56.371
Jill, can you give us
a description of the murderer?

01:34:56.456 --> 01:34:58.540
(reporters shouting questions)

01:35:10.386 --> 01:35:12.805
Jill!
How does it feel to be a hero?

01:35:20.355 --> 01:35:24.107
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

01:35:24.192 --> 01:35:28.570
Jill. You made it.
That's all that matters.

01:35:28.655 --> 01:35:31.073
Trevor, Charlie,
they tried to kill me.

01:35:31.157 --> 01:35:35.786
And I heard they killed my mom.
And... and Robbie and Kirby, too.

01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:38.539
Shh. Just lay back.

01:35:38.623 --> 01:35:41.416
Try to rest.

01:35:41.501 --> 01:35:43.168
Is... is your wife...

01:35:43.253 --> 01:35:45.045
(chuckles softly)

01:35:45.129 --> 01:35:48.924
She's gonna be fine.
She's recovering.

01:35:49.008 --> 01:35:53.136
If I ever write a book one day, I'd...
I'd want her to write it with me.

01:35:53.221 --> 01:35:57.850
We'd be a good team
with our matching wounds and all.

01:35:59.477 --> 01:36:03.355
We're survivors now.

01:36:03.439 --> 01:36:06.149
(voice breaking)
I just wish Sidney was, too.

01:36:06.234 --> 01:36:08.402
Jill...

01:36:08.486 --> 01:36:10.529
they're not sure yet.

01:36:10.613 --> 01:36:13.073
It's still touch and go.

01:36:13.157 --> 01:36:14.783
But she's in ICU.

01:36:14.868 --> 01:36:18.954
And they think Sidney
just might make it.

01:36:19.038 --> 01:36:20.914
What?

01:36:20.999 --> 01:36:23.250
But... but I saw Trevor kill her.

01:36:23.334 --> 01:36:26.003
Look, we don't know yet.

01:36:26.087 --> 01:36:27.838
But she's hanging on.

01:36:31.092 --> 01:36:33.218
I-I-I wanna see her.

01:36:33.303 --> 01:36:36.054
She's not awake yet.

01:36:36.139 --> 01:36:38.682
And she may not
remember anything.

01:36:38.766 --> 01:36:41.143
You'll to help her with that.

01:36:41.227 --> 01:36:44.605
All in time.
Just get some rest now, okay?

01:36:46.316 --> 01:36:47.858
(over PA) Your attention, please.

01:36:47.942 --> 01:36:51.528
There will be a mandatory meeting
for all non-emergency personnel

01:36:51.613 --> 01:36:54.698
in the basement conference room
in five minutes.

01:37:09.714 --> 01:37:14.009
There will be a mandatory meeting
for all non-emergency personnel

01:37:14.093 --> 01:37:17.179
in the basement conference room
in five minutes.

01:37:33.488 --> 01:37:36.198
She gonna be okay?

01:37:36.282 --> 01:37:38.951
Yeah.
She's a strong kid.

01:37:39.035 --> 01:37:41.703
She's gonna have to be.

01:37:41.788 --> 01:37:44.790
(chuckles)
She asked if you were okay.

01:37:44.874 --> 01:37:49.628
She thinks you guys should write a book
together with your matching wounds.

01:37:49.712 --> 01:37:51.588
Why,
she was stabbed in the shoulder?

01:37:55.593 --> 01:37:57.636
How did she know I was, too?

01:38:02.767 --> 01:38:04.559
Damn it!

01:38:10.483 --> 01:38:12.526
You just won't die, will ya?

01:38:12.610 --> 01:38:15.153
- (gasps)
- Who are you?

01:38:15.238 --> 01:38:17.114
Michael fucking Myers?

01:38:18.616 --> 01:38:20.617
Yeah, I don't think so.

01:38:25.039 --> 01:38:27.457
Fucking die already! (grunts)

01:38:29.794 --> 01:38:33.046
Aagh! Aah!

01:38:33.131 --> 01:38:35.424
(both grunting)

01:38:38.052 --> 01:38:39.428
(screams)

01:38:50.481 --> 01:38:52.107
How are those stitches?

01:38:52.191 --> 01:38:53.900
Aagh!

01:38:55.403 --> 01:38:58.196
(Dewey) Sidney!

01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:04.995
Hicks, get up to Sidney Prescott's room
and call for back-up!

01:39:05.079 --> 01:39:06.580
Be right up, sir!

01:39:13.921 --> 01:39:15.547
Sid!

01:39:17.008 --> 01:39:18.675
- Sid...
- Dewey!

01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.677
(grunting)

01:39:36.861 --> 01:39:39.154
Is this how it's gonna be,
Sid?

01:39:39.238 --> 01:39:41.323
The ending of the movie
was supposed to be at the house.

01:39:41.407 --> 01:39:43.700
I mean, this is just silly.

01:39:43.785 --> 01:39:46.870
Consider this an alternate ending.

01:39:46.954 --> 01:39:49.289
You're never
gonna get out of this, Jill.

01:39:49.373 --> 01:39:51.166
- Of course I will.
- Dewey!

01:39:51.250 --> 01:39:54.127
(gasps) Sid?

01:39:54.212 --> 01:39:57.672
Easy. Okay, okay.

01:39:57.757 --> 01:39:59.091
What about the book?

01:39:59.175 --> 01:40:01.468
Looks like
I'll just have to write it myself.

01:40:01.552 --> 01:40:03.720
Yah!

01:40:03.805 --> 01:40:05.222
- God damn it!
- Ohh!

01:40:05.306 --> 01:40:09.601
Don't even think about shooting
or I'll blow Dewey's head off.

01:40:09.685 --> 01:40:12.938
You think I won't do it?
Gimme your gun!

01:40:13.022 --> 01:40:15.315
Do it.

01:40:15.399 --> 01:40:17.275
You heard her.

01:40:25.159 --> 01:40:27.994
You just had to be the hero, huh?

01:40:28.079 --> 01:40:29.746
Gimme your gun.

01:40:29.831 --> 01:40:31.540
(Gale whispers) Give it to her.

01:40:31.624 --> 01:40:34.251
What are you, deaf?

01:40:34.335 --> 01:40:36.962
Give me... your gun!

01:40:43.928 --> 01:40:47.722
Now get up.

01:40:47.807 --> 01:40:49.516
And keep your hands
over your head.

01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:50.851
Don't do anything stu...

01:40:50.935 --> 01:40:52.310
(grunts)

01:40:52.395 --> 01:40:55.355
Don't fucking tell me what to do.

01:40:55.439 --> 01:40:57.482
(softly) Oh, God.

01:40:57.567 --> 01:40:59.109
Now get up, bitch.

01:40:59.193 --> 01:41:01.695
Okay.

01:41:01.779 --> 01:41:03.238
Get up!

01:41:03.322 --> 01:41:06.116
- Now!
- Okay.

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:10.287
She's not gonna help you.
Come on.

01:41:10.371 --> 01:41:13.206
(Dewey groans)
Neither is he.

01:41:13.291 --> 01:41:16.376
- Dewey?
- (grunts)

01:41:16.460 --> 01:41:19.629
Let's go.
Get your skinny ass out here.

01:41:19.714 --> 01:41:22.799
Okay.

01:41:22.884 --> 01:41:26.970
I'm gonna enjoy
blowing your head off.

01:41:27.054 --> 01:41:31.057
Okay, but can I just...

01:41:31.142 --> 01:41:33.310
have one final word?

01:41:33.394 --> 01:41:37.522
What? "Please"?

01:41:37.607 --> 01:41:41.067
No.

01:41:41.152 --> 01:41:43.528
- Clear.
- "Clear"?

01:41:43.613 --> 01:41:44.988
Clear.

01:41:50.328 --> 01:41:52.621
You forgot
the first rule of remakes, Jill.

01:41:52.705 --> 01:41:55.207
Don't fuck with the original.

01:41:58.544 --> 01:42:01.213
Oh, my God, Dewey.

01:42:01.297 --> 01:42:03.089
(groans) What hit me?

01:42:03.174 --> 01:42:06.551
Don't ask. (groans)

01:42:06.636 --> 01:42:08.303
You okay?

01:42:11.474 --> 01:42:14.309
She was standing
right behind me.

01:42:14.393 --> 01:42:17.771
They always are.

01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:21.816
(gasps)

01:42:29.784 --> 01:42:30.909
Oh, God.

01:42:30.993 --> 01:42:33.787
Nice one.

01:42:33.871 --> 01:42:37.082
Hicks? You're alive?

01:42:39.168 --> 01:42:41.878
Wear the vest,
save your chest.

01:42:44.257 --> 01:42:48.260
We got two officers down.
Several injuries.

01:42:48.344 --> 01:42:51.721
- And a new suspect.
- Sheriff? Sheriff...

01:42:51.806 --> 01:42:55.558
We need a doctor, goddamn it!

01:42:55.643 --> 01:42:58.353
I don't know about you,
but I feel a whole lot better.

01:42:58.437 --> 01:43:01.606
Where the hell is everybody?!

01:43:01.691 --> 01:43:04.109
We're live at Woodsboro Community
Hospital,

01:43:04.193 --> 01:43:07.988
awaiting a first public statement
from Jill Roberts, survivor.

01:43:08.072 --> 01:43:12.534
...a survivor of what is now being
called the Woodsboro Massacre Re-boot.

01:43:12.618 --> 01:43:15.996
Jill Roberts is her name,
a name the whole world will now know.

01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:18.331
...who single-handedly put a stop

01:43:18.416 --> 01:43:21.251
to this 21 st-Century
Woodsboro killing spree.

01:43:21.335 --> 01:43:23.295
Jill Roberts of Woodsboro,

01:43:23.379 --> 01:43:26.464
a girl who's lifted
all our spirits tonight,

01:43:26.549 --> 01:43:30.010
an American hero,
right out of the movies.

01:43:33.806 --> 01:43:35.890
("Bad Karma" plays)

01:43:44.734 --> 01:43:47.068
You better believe in karma

01:43:47.153 --> 01:43:49.612
Baby, it's gonna sting

01:43:49.697 --> 01:43:52.324
The wheel of life's gonna
do you in

01:43:52.408 --> 01:43:55.285
So I don't really have to
do a thing

01:43:55.369 --> 01:43:57.704
You made me drink the Kool-Aid

01:43:57.788 --> 01:44:00.332
You tricked me into thinkin'
that Jill means Jack

You are the firstborn of the Devil

You better believe in karma

01:44:51.884 --> 01:44:54.344
Just look at the sorry shape
you're in

01:44:54.428 --> 01:44:56.971
There's a doll with your name
and your gloomy face

At the department of doing a rush
on your case

01:45:00.101 --> 01:45:02.352
You better believe in voodoo,

That's the last you're giving,
