00:50.750 --> 00:52.750
[chimes tinkling]

01:19.166 --> 01:21.166
[wind whistling]

01:29.833 --> 01:33.416
Howzer, I'm approaching with the Senator.
What's your status?

01:34.333 --> 01:35.833
All clear up top.

01:36.416 --> 01:39.083
Greer, is the interior secure?

01:39.166 --> 01:41.375
[Greer on comm]
Affirmative. We're standing by.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.375
Copy that. Stay alert.

01:44.791 --> 01:47.791
[GS-8] I'm not certain it was wise
to come out of hiding, Senator.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.416
It is not safe for us here.

01:50.375 --> 01:52.541
We're not safe anywhere, GS-8.

01:53.458 --> 01:55.125
We must continue on.

01:55.208 --> 01:57.458
[GS-8 sighs] I suppose so.

01:57.541 --> 01:59.875
Don't worry. My team is in position.

02:13.458 --> 02:14.500
Right this way.

02:23.750 --> 02:28.291
Sorry we're late.
I had to take a few extra precautions.

02:29.666 --> 02:30.666
Of course.

02:31.291 --> 02:34.583
Senator Singh,
thank you for meeting with me.

02:34.666 --> 02:36.833
Please, have a seat.

02:37.375 --> 02:39.041
I'll leave you to it.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.875
I must apologize for all the secrecy.

02:47.958 --> 02:50.541
Unfortunately, it is a necessity.

02:50.625 --> 02:54.916
I must say your request was unexpected.

02:55.000 --> 02:59.000
Seeing as how our planets were on
opposite sides during the Clone War.

02:59.750 --> 03:03.666
I believe we are now united
in wanting the same things.

03:04.541 --> 03:07.208
The Separatist Senate
may not exist any longer,

03:07.291 --> 03:12.333
but our desire for true independence
has not faded.

03:12.916 --> 03:15.750
That is a growing sentiment
among my people as well.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.000
There are whispers.

03:19.083 --> 03:25.416
The Emperor is concerned that planets
and systems may unite and oppose him.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.333
That will be difficult to do.

03:27.875 --> 03:32.083
With no unifying leaders on our side,
we're at a disadvantage.

03:32.166 --> 03:35.833
Yes, but the Emperor needs to be cautious.

03:35.916 --> 03:38.000
Public opinion could turn on him quickly.

03:38.708 --> 03:40.583
He cannot just strike out at us openly.

03:41.375 --> 03:46.791
Such limitations haven't stopped them
from occupying planets, including my own.

03:47.916 --> 03:53.916
But I would do anything for my people.
For Raxus.

03:56.416 --> 03:57.833
What are you suggesting?

04:36.541 --> 04:37.416
[grunts]

04:38.750 --> 04:40.000
[chokes]

04:45.875 --> 04:46.791
[comm beeps]

04:46.875 --> 04:48.625
Samson, report.

04:48.708 --> 04:51.541
[Samson] Cold. But quiet.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.625
Greer.

04:55.083 --> 04:56.250
Greer, come in.

04:57.708 --> 04:58.708
[comm beeps]

05:04.500 --> 05:07.083
[Howzer] Rex, Greer's not responding.
Check the kitchen.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.083
Intruder! Protect the Senators!

05:15.458 --> 05:17.416
-[detonator powering up]
-[Rex] Everyone down!

05:31.916 --> 05:34.250
The assailant's gone underground.
We're in pursuit.

05:38.041 --> 05:40.750
We've got eyes on him. He's heading
for the southern maintenance tower.

05:40.833 --> 05:41.791
[Howzer] On it.

05:41.875 --> 05:42.875
[detonator powering up]

05:55.375 --> 05:56.500
[speeder bike approaches]

05:56.583 --> 05:58.833
[grunting]

06:07.041 --> 06:08.041
I got him.

06:08.625 --> 06:11.375
It's one of those shadows
we keep running into.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.750
We secured the assassin.

06:25.833 --> 06:31.333
But I'd advise you and Singh to keep
a lower profile until we know more.

06:32.083 --> 06:35.000
If I get any intel out of him,
I'll let you know.

06:35.583 --> 06:37.916
Understood. Thank you, Rex.

06:44.875 --> 06:46.291
You think he'll cooperate?

06:46.875 --> 06:50.291
I wouldn't count on it,
but we have to try.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.208
We recovered this from his gear.

06:53.291 --> 06:56.291
It's a data puck. Highly encrypted.

06:57.166 --> 07:00.583
Have Fireball find out what's on it
when we get back to base camp.

08:00.625 --> 08:03.208
Did you extract the device?

08:05.041 --> 08:09.250
The electro capsule was implanted
in one of his teeth. Just like you said.

08:09.333 --> 08:11.916
His identifying number's been wiped too.

08:14.250 --> 08:17.250
What exactly did the Empire do to him?

08:23.500 --> 08:24.708
What's your name, trooper?

08:28.000 --> 08:31.083
Listen, no matter what they did to you,

08:31.166 --> 08:34.666
no matter what you've done,
you're still a clone.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.041
Still one of us.

08:36.791 --> 08:40.291
I can help you, but we need answers.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.791
Why have I been activated?

09:02.875 --> 09:05.375
One of the other operatives has gone dark.

09:05.458 --> 09:09.458
His internal homing device remains intact.
So, we know he's alive.

09:10.125 --> 09:11.916
My orders?

09:12.000 --> 09:15.750
He's been compromised.
Track him down and neutralize him.

09:25.125 --> 09:27.125
We know there are others like you.

09:27.708 --> 09:32.125
Where are you based? Coruscant? Daro?

09:33.208 --> 09:34.291
Tantiss?

09:35.500 --> 09:40.041
Oh, yeah, we know about Tantiss.
And the clones imprisoned there.

09:40.833 --> 09:42.666
Were you one of them?

09:44.541 --> 09:45.958
Tell us where it is.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.041
You need to push him harder.

09:57.125 --> 09:58.125
[sighs]

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Rex.

10:04.416 --> 10:07.875
His data puck was a target register.

10:07.958 --> 10:09.208
Who was he after?

10:09.291 --> 10:11.000
Senator Singh.

10:11.083 --> 10:14.166
But that wasn't the only person
on his list.

10:18.666 --> 10:21.500
Contact Echo and Hunter.
We need to let them know.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.708
We should bring them here.

10:26.791 --> 10:30.166
No. No.
I-I don't want to involve them in this.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.833
It's too late for that.

10:31.916 --> 10:36.750
Crosshair is with them.
This is our chance to question him.

10:36.833 --> 10:38.541
Echo's already done that.

10:38.625 --> 10:40.125
But we haven't.

10:40.625 --> 10:42.291
He knows more than he's saying.

10:43.166 --> 10:47.166
If you want to locate Tantiss,
then we need him to talk.

11:06.750 --> 11:07.833
[Batcher whines]

11:13.041 --> 11:15.000
So, where exactly are we headed?

11:15.541 --> 11:18.250
It's a base of sorts.

11:18.333 --> 11:21.375
I thought your rendezvous with Gregor
was top priority.

11:21.458 --> 11:25.041
Yeah, well, I'll pick him up
after dropping you lot off.

11:25.125 --> 11:26.166
[whines]

11:27.916 --> 11:31.583
Any idea why Rex wants us there
so urgently?

11:31.666 --> 11:34.333
He didn't say. But it must be important.

12:14.208 --> 12:16.791
They don't look happy to see us.

12:16.875 --> 12:18.875
Just like old times, huh?

12:18.958 --> 12:19.958
[laughs]

12:24.833 --> 12:25.958
[Batcher barks]

12:27.000 --> 12:28.083
Thanks for coming.

12:31.291 --> 12:32.750
Good to see you, Rex.

12:33.458 --> 12:35.333
Wish I felt the same.

12:35.416 --> 12:38.416
I have unfinished business with this one.

12:39.208 --> 12:40.541
Remember me?

12:42.958 --> 12:44.541
Surprised I'm alive?

12:44.625 --> 12:48.541
Most of my squad from Ryloth
is dead because of you.

12:48.625 --> 12:50.458
Easy, Howzer.

12:50.541 --> 12:54.666
I know you two have history.
But we're all on the same side now.

12:55.291 --> 12:56.541
[scoffs]

12:56.625 --> 12:58.625
Why'd you call us here, Captain?

12:59.125 --> 13:01.791
We have something to show you. Follow me.

13:09.041 --> 13:10.041
Omega!

13:13.666 --> 13:17.583
I was planning on giving you this
after I made a few more modifications.

13:17.666 --> 13:20.583
But, uh, now's as good a time as any.

13:20.666 --> 13:25.000
[gasps] An energy crossbow.
Where did you get it?

13:25.083 --> 13:29.958
Well, I've made a few interesting contacts
across the galaxy.

13:30.916 --> 13:32.041
It's perfect.

13:33.041 --> 13:34.041
Thank you, Echo.

13:34.958 --> 13:36.291
Well, I won't be gone long.

13:36.791 --> 13:41.000
You better head inside and, uh,
keep them in line. [grunts]

14:04.458 --> 14:06.041
[console beeping]

14:25.458 --> 14:27.458
[beeping continues]

15:17.500 --> 15:19.291
Your numbers are growing.

15:19.375 --> 15:21.333
Well, we need all the help we can get.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.750
Once we find the exact coordinates
of the Tantiss Base,

15:25.333 --> 15:28.625
we have to hit it hard if we're gonna pull
our brothers out of there.

15:32.416 --> 15:34.166
I have questions about the facility,

15:34.250 --> 15:37.791
but that's not the only reason
why I sent for you.

15:39.000 --> 15:45.208
We recovered a target list from
an Imperial operative. And Omega's on it.

15:45.291 --> 15:50.125
Not a surprise.
She escaped Imperial custody.

15:50.208 --> 15:53.041
So did you. But you're not on the list.

15:53.958 --> 15:56.625
Guess I'm not as valuable to them.

15:56.708 --> 15:58.875
Or you're feeding them information.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.041
You're gonna have to back down, Captain.

16:01.125 --> 16:04.958
You expect us to believe
he was held on Tantiss for months,

16:05.041 --> 16:06.958
but he doesn't know how to get back there?

16:08.708 --> 16:12.875
Whether you believe me or not,
it's the truth.

16:15.666 --> 16:19.166
But I'm not loyal to the Empire
any longer.

16:19.250 --> 16:23.041
Your squad may trust you. But I don't.

16:23.125 --> 16:24.125
[Batcher barks]

16:25.666 --> 16:27.333
What's going on?

16:27.416 --> 16:31.000
The Empire's targeting you again.

16:31.083 --> 16:33.541
[chuckles] No surprise there.

16:34.041 --> 16:36.125
[Rex] Why were they after you before?

16:37.250 --> 16:42.500
To force Nala Se to cooperate
and conduct certain experiments.

16:43.208 --> 16:45.250
Which were what?

16:46.000 --> 16:50.666
She was working on something
involving M-Count.

16:50.750 --> 16:52.000
I don't know what that means,

16:52.083 --> 16:57.000
but they were taking blood samples
from everyone, even me.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.541
M-Count?

16:58.625 --> 17:00.041
You know what that is?

17:00.125 --> 17:04.291
Well, I've heard it mentioned before.
But I can't say for sure.

17:07.041 --> 17:08.833
What else can you tell us?

17:40.666 --> 17:44.750
When we escaped, there wasn't
enough time to free the other clones.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.166
We have to find a way to get them out.

17:48.375 --> 17:49.625
We will.

17:50.458 --> 17:51.958
[Fireball] Chow time.

17:52.875 --> 17:57.750
Gregor's recipe,
with a few of my own spicy modifications.

17:57.833 --> 18:01.166
Oh, now you're talking. [chuckles]

18:02.416 --> 18:03.416
Wait.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.833
There's more you should know.

18:07.958 --> 18:10.833
Not all of the clones on Tantiss
are prisoners.

18:10.916 --> 18:14.125
Some are loyal to the Empire.

18:16.166 --> 18:22.000
There is a division of clones
trained as specialized operatives

18:22.083 --> 18:27.333
and initiated into a secret
deep cover program run by Hemlock.

18:28.958 --> 18:34.625
Their identities are erased.
They undergo conditioning.

18:35.416 --> 18:40.083
The few that make it through
come out different.

18:40.791 --> 18:44.416
If the program's so secretive,
how do you know about it?

18:44.500 --> 18:47.791
Because they tried to make me
into one of them.

18:47.875 --> 18:48.875
Tried?

18:48.958 --> 18:50.625
It didn't work.

18:51.583 --> 18:55.583
Being defective is in my nature.

18:56.166 --> 18:59.916
You've encountered one before.
The assassin on Coruscant.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.625
We've known they existed

19:03.916 --> 19:07.125
but never knew exactly what they were.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.000
What aren't you telling us?

19:12.166 --> 19:14.833
We captured one.

19:15.500 --> 19:19.000
I've tried questioning him,
but he hasn't been very cooperative.

19:19.083 --> 19:21.791
You have one here? Alive?

19:23.041 --> 19:27.250
Impossible.
The Empire would be on top of us already.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.541
They have ways of tracking
their operatives.

19:29.625 --> 19:31.291
We scanned him. He's clear.

19:31.375 --> 19:34.916
It's not the kind of tracker
your scans would pick up.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.291
Hemlock's smarter than that.

19:37.916 --> 19:39.958
Where's the operative? Show us.

20:11.000 --> 20:12.041
[whines]

20:30.875 --> 20:32.000
[whines]

20:33.333 --> 20:34.583
-[barks]
-[Omega] It's okay.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.083
[sighs] We won't be here long.

20:37.708 --> 20:39.625
Here. You can have mine.

20:42.875 --> 20:45.208
[wind whistling]

21:02.291 --> 21:03.375
[console beeping]

21:03.458 --> 21:05.375
[powering up]

21:08.416 --> 21:10.541
[Scorch]
Have you neutralized the operative?

21:10.625 --> 21:12.166
In progress.

21:12.250 --> 21:17.333
However, I have a visual
on Dr. Hemlock's prime target.

21:18.166 --> 21:19.500
Is it confirmed?

21:19.583 --> 21:24.541
It's her.
She's with a group of rogue clones.

21:24.625 --> 21:27.625
Send the coordinates
and prepare for the Recovery Strike Team.

21:27.708 --> 21:30.666
The girl must be taken alive.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.333
Understood.

21:50.083 --> 21:52.625
[groans, pants]

21:59.458 --> 22:01.666
We need to leave. Now.

22:01.750 --> 22:07.333
If you want answers so badly,
why aren't you asking him?

22:08.875 --> 22:11.166
Right, brother?

22:19.833 --> 22:21.750
[powering down]

22:21.833 --> 22:23.541
He's lying.

22:27.333 --> 22:29.416
[assassin clone]
You're right about one thing.

22:30.708 --> 22:34.875
They are coming for all of you.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.000
-[chuckles]
-[explosion]

22:42.333 --> 22:43.625
[clone trooper grunts]

22:45.125 --> 22:46.416
Comms are down.

22:46.500 --> 22:47.666
[assassin clone groans]

22:47.750 --> 22:49.541
[chuckles]

22:49.625 --> 22:51.041
We move out. Now!

22:57.500 --> 22:59.083
[Wrecker] We got a shooter out here!

23:04.583 --> 23:06.708
[blaster fire]

23:07.583 --> 23:09.375
Shots coming from the back of the room!

23:09.458 --> 23:11.416
Nemec, we need to get comms online.

23:16.208 --> 23:17.708
What do we do?

23:25.666 --> 23:27.625
Backup plan. Into the command post!
