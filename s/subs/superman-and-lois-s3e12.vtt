00:01.523 --> 00:02.872
<i>Previously on
"Superman and Lois"...</i>

00:02.872 --> 00:04.439
- You're Superman.
- Keep everything

00:04.439 --> 00:06.963
I just told you a secret.
- Yeah, of course.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.921
- Oh, my God!
<i>- Sarah and George Jr.,</i>

00:08.921 --> 00:10.401
<i>they were
almost in this car wreck,</i>

00:10.401 --> 00:12.099
<i>so I flew in
to try to save them,</i>

00:12.099 --> 00:13.839
<i>but I think George might
have seen me after.</i>

00:13.839 --> 00:15.276
Whatever Junior thinks
he saw, we can deal with later.

00:15.276 --> 00:17.060
<i>You and Bruno
killed Boss Moxie,</i>

00:17.060 --> 00:18.801
and you used Luthor
as your fall guy.

00:18.801 --> 00:20.411
Setting him free would be

00:20.411 --> 00:22.587
the biggest mistake
of your life.

00:22.587 --> 00:24.415
<i>Having a bilateral
mastectomy is scary,</i>

00:24.415 --> 00:26.200
<i>but I will get
the surgery done right.</i>

00:26.200 --> 00:28.332
I couldn't have gone through
this surgery without you.

00:28.332 --> 00:31.031
I'm gonna do everything I can
to take the best care of you.

00:35.687 --> 00:39.387
<i>They say
time heals all wounds.</i>

00:39.387 --> 00:42.607
<i>It's a nice idea.</i>

00:42.607 --> 00:44.218
<i>At least I used to think so.</i>

00:49.223 --> 00:52.226
<i>The truth is
a little more complicated.</i>

00:54.619 --> 00:57.753
<i>Healing is a full-time job,</i>

00:57.753 --> 01:00.277
<i>and throughout the process,</i>

01:00.277 --> 01:02.236
<i>you're never quite yourself.</i>

01:07.197 --> 01:11.810
<i>All you want is to be better,</i>

01:11.810 --> 01:15.423
<i>but that will only come
once you pay the price:</i>

01:15.423 --> 01:19.035
<i>time.</i>

01:19.035 --> 01:20.993
<i>What no one tells you, though,</i>

01:20.993 --> 01:24.780
<i>is how much time
it's gonna take.</i>

01:24.780 --> 01:28.697
<i>How long until you heal.</i>

01:28.697 --> 01:33.180
<i>How long
until you feel normal again,</i>

01:33.180 --> 01:35.834
<i>until you get
your confidence back.</i>

01:38.228 --> 01:42.841
<i>You're not sure
you ever will, fully.</i>

01:42.841 --> 01:44.887
<i>And it feels
like an injustice.</i>

01:48.760 --> 01:54.026
<i>But at some point,
you have to decide</i>

01:54.026 --> 01:57.247
<i>that who you are now,</i>

01:57.247 --> 01:59.728
<i>it's gonna have to be enough.</i>

02:02.774 --> 02:04.646
There's still no update.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.952
Luthor's legal team has had
Bruno's confession for weeks.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.650
I thought for sure
we'd know something by now.

02:08.650 --> 02:09.781
The minute
they overturn that conviction,

02:09.781 --> 02:11.392
Luthor's gonna go free.

02:11.392 --> 02:14.134
Lois, you were right
to publish the article.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.223
Whether I was right or not
doesn't really matter.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.007
I'm one of the people
Lex blames.

02:18.007 --> 02:19.661
Look, if when he's released
he becomes a problem,

02:19.661 --> 02:21.053
I'll deal with it.

02:21.053 --> 02:23.447
It's not if,
it's when, Clark.

02:23.447 --> 02:27.973
What Peia said about him
being the devil, she's right.

02:27.973 --> 02:31.368
We need to get ahead of this,
maybe go through our old files,

02:31.368 --> 02:33.631
see if we can find anything.
- Okay, babe, I just--

02:33.631 --> 02:35.067
I don't want you
pushing yourself too hard

02:35.067 --> 02:36.852
'cause you're still recovering.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.941
Luthor has been in prison
for almost two decades,

02:38.941 --> 02:41.987
no doubt stewing
over how to get even.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.120
If there was ever a time
to push myself,

02:44.120 --> 02:48.037
it's right now,
because he's coming after us.

03:25.422 --> 03:27.642
I just received word
from your attorneys.

03:27.642 --> 03:30.166
Judge Regan has made
her ruling.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.223
Gather my things.

03:46.269 --> 03:48.619
I'm a free man.

03:55.670 --> 03:57.759
Why won't you
just talk to me about it?

03:57.759 --> 03:59.630
I don't want to talk
about this anymore, Junior.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.893
I want to forget that accident
ever happened and move on.

04:01.893 --> 04:04.113
Yeah, I get it, but it wasn't
Superman who saved us, Sarah.

04:04.113 --> 04:06.158
Okay, if it wasn't, so what?

04:06.158 --> 04:07.943
So that means there's someone
else out there with powers,

04:07.943 --> 04:09.640
and I think
people should know that.

04:09.640 --> 04:12.164
What are you gonna do,
a podcast or something?

04:12.164 --> 04:15.211
No.
I did an interview, though.

04:15.211 --> 04:18.170
- At the "Gazette"?
- Uh-uh. Way bigger.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.868
Yo, Junior.

04:19.868 --> 04:22.871
Tell them what you told us
in trig this morning.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.438
Whatever, Wellnitz.

04:24.438 --> 04:26.353
No, I'm not gonna
make fun of you, I swear.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.572
It was nothing.
It was just--

04:28.572 --> 04:32.359
I think whoever saved
me and Sarah is our age.

04:32.359 --> 04:35.144
I mean, he had goggles on,
some sort of weird hoodie.

04:35.144 --> 04:36.580
Goggles?

04:36.580 --> 04:39.061
You didn't say anything before
about goggles.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.628
Probably just to hide
their identity.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.151
He wasn't.

04:42.151 --> 04:43.674
Such a joke.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.807
Maybe Junior's right.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.374
Maybe there is someone
out there our age.

04:47.374 --> 04:50.028
If so,
guy's a total badass, right?

04:50.028 --> 04:52.727
But goggles, though?

04:52.727 --> 04:54.206
I can't get past
safety goggles.

04:56.383 --> 04:59.386
Has Chrissy organized
all the Luthor files?

04:59.386 --> 05:03.085
She texted me earlier.
She's still sick.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.695
Are you sure you want
to go to the "Gazette"?

05:04.695 --> 05:06.436
I appreciate it, honey,
but we need to do this.

05:09.352 --> 05:12.312
Hey, Janet.
<i>- Hey, Lois. Have a sec?</i>

05:12.312 --> 05:14.139
I got a lead
that's sort of in the old

05:14.139 --> 05:16.838
Lois Lane "Daily Planet"
territory.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.405
Is this about Luthor?

05:18.405 --> 05:20.450
<i>Foswell gave that story
to Simone.</i>

05:20.450 --> 05:24.324
<i>It's about someone
with powers.</i>

05:24.324 --> 05:26.021
- Superman?
<i>- Someone new.</i>

05:26.021 --> 05:27.588
<i>Sounds like a kid.</i>

05:27.588 --> 05:28.893
<i>Saved two teenagers
in Smallville</i>

05:28.893 --> 05:30.504
a couple weeks back.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.680
You heard anything about this?
- Not really.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.943
Did one of the teenagers
get in touch with you?

05:34.943 --> 05:37.467
<i>Yeah. This story feels huge.</i>

05:37.467 --> 05:39.556
And since you were the first
person to report on Superman,

05:39.556 --> 05:41.384
I was hoping
I could pick your brain.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.608
Sure.

05:47.608 --> 05:50.480
What do you need to know?

05:50.480 --> 05:55.224
I don't want to hear
about any more supply issues.

05:55.224 --> 05:58.096
I'm gonna hold you to that.

06:00.751 --> 06:02.840
Looks like you're having
the same kind of day I am.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.887
- Worse.
- You want to talk about it?

06:05.887 --> 06:07.062
It's about Jordan.

06:07.062 --> 06:08.890
Honey.

06:08.890 --> 06:12.023
It's gonna take some time.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.242
What?

06:13.242 --> 06:14.939
No.

06:14.939 --> 06:18.421
It's not about us, it's--

06:18.421 --> 06:20.292
if he doesn't want to talk
to me, fine, whatever, grow up.

06:20.292 --> 06:22.425
But he was talking about
the whole superhero thing

06:22.425 --> 06:23.861
at school today.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.341
- What?
- He was bragging about it.

06:25.341 --> 06:27.169
He said
that if there was someone

06:27.169 --> 06:29.606
that saved me and Junior,
that that person is a hero.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.391
Jordan said that?

06:31.391 --> 06:33.088
I've been carrying around
this secret for months,

06:33.088 --> 06:34.481
worried that I was gonna say

06:34.481 --> 06:36.134
the wrong thing
at the wrong time.

06:36.134 --> 06:38.136
I lied to dad, to Junior,
to everyone all for him,

06:38.136 --> 06:40.487
and then he just goes
and brags about it

06:40.487 --> 06:43.490
to Wellnitz's dumb ass.

06:43.490 --> 06:46.536
It is not okay
that he's doing this.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.538
No.

06:48.538 --> 06:50.105
If he doesn't care
about his secret,

06:50.105 --> 06:52.368
then I shouldn't either.

07:10.995 --> 07:13.868
Lex, do you still plan
on appealing?

07:15.826 --> 07:17.959
Judge Regan sentenced you
to seven life sentences

07:17.959 --> 07:19.395
with no chance of parole.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.353
How are you feeling?

07:21.353 --> 07:24.226
Is your wife gonna
take control of LexCorp?

07:24.226 --> 07:26.402
- Statement?
- Prisoner coming through.

07:30.667 --> 07:34.236
Wasn't easy,
but I did as you requested.

07:34.236 --> 07:35.890
The press won't be
alerted of your release

07:35.890 --> 07:37.761
until later today.

07:37.761 --> 07:39.328
Sure you don't need anything,
Mr. Luthor?

07:39.328 --> 07:41.112
A ride, maybe?

07:41.112 --> 07:44.507
Just make sure Otis arrives
at the time discussed.

07:48.380 --> 07:49.904
Uh, yes, sir.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.848
Hey, give me
some of that Bazoombas.

08:22.676 --> 08:25.505
Hey, you mind passing
those cheesy tots, Tamera?

08:25.505 --> 08:28.420
Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.640
Are you even old enough
to go in this place?

08:33.208 --> 08:35.427
Hey, kid.

08:35.427 --> 08:36.864
You forgot my sandwich.

08:36.864 --> 08:38.953
Oh, I'm pretty sure
I ordered it.

08:38.953 --> 08:40.345
Well, it's not in there,

08:40.345 --> 08:42.522
so you need to go back
and get it.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.915
No, just let the kid
finish his meal, huh?

08:44.915 --> 08:46.613
Screw that.
He messed up my order.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.440
No, it's okay. I'll get it.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.530
No.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.054
I say we're gonna let the kid
finish his meal, Park.

08:55.143 --> 08:56.971
Why are you babying this kid?

08:56.971 --> 08:58.450
A few weeks ago,
you wanted to fire him,

08:58.450 --> 09:00.322
and now he's getting
a free pass?

09:00.322 --> 09:01.845
Go, get my food.

09:01.845 --> 09:04.369
No, you're not
going anywhere.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.936
All right,
and just so we're all clear,

09:05.936 --> 09:07.764
I'm not a fan
of this hazing crap.

09:07.764 --> 09:10.158
Whatever. Screw this.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.986
Yeah, you're done
for the day.

09:11.986 --> 09:13.422
Go home.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.040
I'm sorry, that's on me.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.302
I should have
double-checked his order.

09:24.302 --> 09:25.608
No, no, listen.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.349
Park is way out of line,
all right?

09:27.349 --> 09:29.351
I'll talk to him
over his next shift,

09:29.351 --> 09:32.223
but you just keep doing
what you're doing.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.486
Make your old man proud, huh?

09:37.402 --> 09:39.013
<i>Usually I can
cover our tracks.</i>

09:39.013 --> 09:42.059
Wipe a photo here,
discredit a story there.

09:42.059 --> 09:44.366
But when Jordan rescued
those kids from that accident,

09:44.366 --> 09:46.324
he let himself be seen.

09:46.324 --> 09:48.500
And now George Jr.
won't shut up about it.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.198
Which is why
your "Daily Planet" pal

09:50.198 --> 09:51.591
has been calling the DOD,

09:51.591 --> 09:53.027
wanting a comment
on the record.

09:53.027 --> 09:54.768
I trained Janet myself.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.291
Trust your gut.
Never drop a lead.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.422
It's like I gave her
the Cliffs Notes

09:57.422 --> 09:58.772
on how to ruin our lives.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.077
She's gonna publish soon.

10:02.819 --> 10:03.951
How do we fix this?

10:03.951 --> 10:05.561
Only one option makes sense.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.215
You gotta put the kibosh
on Jordan.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.999
Starting right now,
no more saves,

10:08.999 --> 10:11.567
not until this all dies down.

10:12.742 --> 10:14.875
Hey. I don't mean to intrude.

10:14.875 --> 10:16.093
I saw your car out front.

10:16.093 --> 10:17.225
Hi, Sam.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.705
Mm, afternoon, Mayor.

10:20.271 --> 10:23.797
I've been meaning to follow up,
see if you made it

10:23.797 --> 10:25.494
back out
onto the dating circuit.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.278
Haven't quite mustered
the nerve.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.933
You?
- Still working on it.

10:29.933 --> 10:31.065
Ah, thank you.

10:33.154 --> 10:36.374
You guys, I'm sorry to just
show up and drop this on you.

10:36.374 --> 10:39.464
It's just that Sarah hasn't
been doing too well

10:39.464 --> 10:41.075
ever since the accident,

10:41.075 --> 10:44.339
and I'm afraid
Jordan isn't helping matters.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.558
What did he do now?

10:46.558 --> 10:49.779
It's more that alter egoof his.

10:49.779 --> 10:54.088
I think maybe Jordan's
enjoying it a little too much.

11:28.992 --> 11:33.693
Hey, O, looks like
you got a new customer.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.349
Here for a trim, fish?

11:38.349 --> 11:39.699
I cut my own hair.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.135
Then what do you want?

11:41.135 --> 11:42.571
Those.

11:42.571 --> 11:45.139
Damn.
He wants your moneymakers.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.663
I'm here
to make you an offer.

11:47.663 --> 11:50.013
An offer from you?

11:50.013 --> 11:51.928
Yeah, okay, billionaire.

11:51.928 --> 11:53.843
- 10,000.
- 20,000.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.324
I'm thinking 5.

11:56.324 --> 11:57.673
5,000?

11:57.673 --> 11:59.283
$5.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.811
With the promise of more
opportunities to come.

12:04.811 --> 12:08.379
You pay what I ask, fish.

12:08.379 --> 12:11.513
And right now,
I'm asking 50,000.

12:11.513 --> 12:15.386
$5, and I'll let you
keep your cell.

12:17.693 --> 12:20.043
You can keep your teeth.

12:21.653 --> 12:23.133
And maybe you can still walk.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.848
You want these?

12:48.115 --> 12:51.205
You should have taken my offer.

13:08.962 --> 13:12.400
<i>I'm just saying,
all I want is a fair shot.</i>

13:12.400 --> 13:16.883
Why does it matter
who my dad is, you know?

13:16.883 --> 13:18.710
Maybe you're reading
a little too much into this.

13:18.710 --> 13:21.191
It's a firehouse.
It's like any other team.

13:21.191 --> 13:23.106
People talk trash,
they make fun of the new guy,

13:23.106 --> 13:25.195
and I was part of that
until, suddenly,

13:25.195 --> 13:27.458
Mr. Cushing started
treating me different.

13:27.458 --> 13:30.331
And I think we both know why.

13:30.331 --> 13:33.203
He just walked in the door.

13:34.465 --> 13:35.771
Everything okay?

13:35.771 --> 13:38.121
Yeah, everything's good.
It's great.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.775
He's just mad 'cause
the guys at the firehouse

13:39.775 --> 13:41.255
aren't allowed
to be mean to him.

13:41.255 --> 13:44.301
No, I just want
to be one of them.

13:44.301 --> 13:48.218
But you don't get to be normal
when your dad is Superman.

13:48.218 --> 13:49.872
I'm sorry,
how is this my fault?

13:49.872 --> 13:51.613
You know what, we can
talk about all of that later.

13:51.613 --> 13:55.008
Right now, your dad and I need
to talk to Jordan, alone.

13:59.490 --> 14:01.014
Am I in trouble?

14:01.014 --> 14:02.580
My mask covers my face.

14:02.580 --> 14:03.712
So what if someone sees me?

14:03.712 --> 14:05.279
"So what?"

14:05.279 --> 14:07.977
The "Daily Planet" won't stop
calling your grandad

14:07.977 --> 14:09.979
about the Smallville Samaritan.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.807
Okay, people talk
about Superman all the time.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.113
Is it really
the end of the world

14:13.113 --> 14:14.462
if I get
a little bit of credit?

14:14.462 --> 14:15.811
It's not about credit.

14:15.811 --> 14:17.247
I thought you knew
better than that.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.901
I know
it's not all about credit.

14:18.901 --> 14:22.035
Then why are you bragging
to your friends about it?

14:22.035 --> 14:24.820
Wait, did Sarah say
something to Miss Lang?

14:24.820 --> 14:26.822
Look, it doesn't matter
who said what.

14:26.822 --> 14:28.389
Great, so now I'm in trouble

14:28.389 --> 14:30.391
because my ex-girlfriend
can't handle reality.

14:30.391 --> 14:33.350
You are in trouble because
you're not being responsible.

14:33.350 --> 14:35.831
If you're not careful,
this could ruin your life.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.354
That's a little dramatic.

14:37.354 --> 14:39.835
Your behavior is
a massive red flag, young man.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.968
All I said was that
whoever saved Sarah and Junior

14:41.968 --> 14:44.187
did an awesome job,
because I did.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.320
All right, enough.

14:46.320 --> 14:49.018
We're done talking about it.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.846
I thought you understood
the responsibility

14:50.846 --> 14:52.456
that comes
with what you can do.

14:52.456 --> 14:53.893
Obviously, I was wrong.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.896
Until we say otherwise,
you're done.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.029
No using your powers in public.

15:00.029 --> 15:01.378
You need to hand in your suit.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.867
Well, I got his suit.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.347
How'd that go?

15:13.347 --> 15:14.391
Ah, not well.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.219
Yeah, he's pretty upset.

15:16.219 --> 15:19.048
Well, maybe that'll change
once he sees this.

15:19.048 --> 15:20.484
She posted it already?

15:20.484 --> 15:22.008
I would have done
the same thing.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.401
I did do the same thing,
actually, with you.

15:24.401 --> 15:27.187
Okay, so we just have
to hope this dies down?

15:27.187 --> 15:29.015
Clark, when my Superman
article was published,

15:29.015 --> 15:30.712
it was the biggest story
in the world.

15:30.712 --> 15:32.757
Yeah, but the DOD wasn't
actively trying to kill it.

15:32.757 --> 15:36.022
DOD can't stop the internet.

15:36.022 --> 15:38.415
I don't know, I'm just
worried this is all too soon.

15:38.415 --> 15:40.678
So am I, but it was
gonna happen eventually.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.115
I mean,
you're already training him.

15:42.115 --> 15:44.030
Yeah, only because I thought
getting a taste

15:44.030 --> 15:45.857
of what it felt like to help
people would be good for him,

15:45.857 --> 15:48.295
but it doesn't seem like
that's why he wants to do it.

15:48.295 --> 15:50.079
I mean, if he's bragging
to kids at school about it,

15:50.079 --> 15:53.343
then all of this,
it's just about recognition.

15:53.343 --> 15:55.998
So we have one son who wants
to be treated specially

15:55.998 --> 15:57.478
and one who doesn't.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.959
I think I can do something
about the latter.

16:01.395 --> 16:04.137
Ah, thanks.

16:04.137 --> 16:05.442
Well, hey, man.

16:05.442 --> 16:07.009
I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.056
You want a quick tour,

16:10.056 --> 16:11.840
see what Jon's been up to
these past few months?

16:11.840 --> 16:15.235
Actually, I was wondering
if we could speak in private.

16:16.366 --> 16:19.369
Uh, yeah, man. Sure.

16:19.369 --> 16:20.849
Come on over.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.811
Hey, man, look.

16:26.811 --> 16:28.552
I hope this goes
without saying,

16:28.552 --> 16:32.469
but whatever Superman needs,

16:32.469 --> 16:33.470
all you gotta do is ask.

16:33.470 --> 16:34.602
Oh, thanks.

16:34.602 --> 16:37.039
That's sort of why I'm here.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.301
I could really use a favor.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.477
Yeah.

16:40.477 --> 16:42.566
It'd be great if when
Jon's here working for you,

16:42.566 --> 16:46.005
if you could forget who I am.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.745
You want to run that
by me again?

16:47.745 --> 16:49.225
I'm just wondering
if maybe you've been

16:49.225 --> 16:52.924
treating him differently
because of me?

16:52.924 --> 16:54.622
Jon said that?

16:54.622 --> 16:56.450
Jon's the kind of kid
who wants to earn his own spot,

16:56.450 --> 16:57.886
you know, be judged
on his efforts

16:57.886 --> 17:00.758
and no one else's,
especially mine.

17:02.238 --> 17:05.459
Yeah, point taken.
I'll--I'll handle it.

17:05.459 --> 17:07.635
Thanks.
Lois and I really appreciate

17:07.635 --> 17:08.853
what you're doing, Kyle.

17:08.853 --> 17:11.421
Jon loves being here.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.902
I'm just--
I'm happy I can help.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.252
Right.

17:16.252 --> 17:19.038
I'll let you get back to it.

17:24.956 --> 17:27.089
<i>Hi. You've reached Lana.</i>

17:27.089 --> 17:28.830
<i>Leave a message.</i>

17:28.830 --> 17:31.311
Mom, where are you?
I'm gonna be late.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.139
Finally.

17:33.139 --> 17:34.314
I just have to pee
real quick.

17:34.314 --> 17:35.489
What took you so long?

17:35.489 --> 17:36.838
I had to stop by
the "Gazette."

17:36.838 --> 17:38.492
Why were you
at the "Gazette"?

17:38.492 --> 17:40.494
Because I had to speak
to Clark and Lois about Jordan.

17:40.494 --> 17:42.017
- What?
- Honey, what he's doing

17:42.017 --> 17:43.497
is dangerous, all right?

17:43.497 --> 17:45.151
They've already published
an article about him

17:45.151 --> 17:46.674
in the "Daily Planet."

17:47.936 --> 17:49.198
Now he's gonna know I told you.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.026
Yeah, well, I'm sorry,
but this is

17:51.026 --> 17:53.028
way more important
than his feelings.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.812
Yeah, and apparently mine.

17:54.812 --> 17:55.987
Sarah.

17:55.987 --> 17:57.119
Don't worry about driving me.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.686
I'll walk.

18:06.520 --> 18:10.089
Otis and his boy
sure did a number on you.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.916
Maybe next time,
don't go making demands

18:11.916 --> 18:14.136
your ass can't back up.

18:14.136 --> 18:17.270
He has something I want.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.967
You're gonna help me get it.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.274
Well, if you've come here
to bribe me,

18:21.274 --> 18:23.885
then I'm all ears.

18:23.885 --> 18:26.540
I'm not gonna
pay you anything.

18:26.540 --> 18:28.803
Then I think we're done here.

18:28.803 --> 18:31.197
I'm here
to make you an offer.

18:37.028 --> 18:40.989
Call this number.

18:40.989 --> 18:45.080
What happens next is up to you,

18:45.080 --> 18:48.518
but your time is running out.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.144
That's my home number.

19:11.759 --> 19:13.674
<i>Dad. Dad, help me.</i>

19:13.674 --> 19:15.415
<i>They're gonna kill me
if you don't do what he says.</i>

19:15.415 --> 19:17.547
Jeffrey, who's there?

19:17.547 --> 19:19.941
Where's your mother?
<i>- The men took her.</i>

19:19.941 --> 19:22.857
<i>She was screaming,
but then it stopped.</i>

19:22.857 --> 19:25.512
<i>Dad, please. I'm scared.</i>
- Jeffrey, stay strong, son.

19:25.512 --> 19:29.864
I'm gonna get--

19:29.864 --> 19:34.564
Those men,
they'll wait five minutes.

19:42.529 --> 19:43.660
Okay.

19:43.660 --> 19:46.097
Now,

19:46.097 --> 19:47.447
let me explain to you

19:47.447 --> 19:50.319
how things are gonna work
around here.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.589
Sorry it's come to this.

19:59.589 --> 20:00.938
When I gave Jordan that suit,

20:00.938 --> 20:02.375
I honestly thought
he was ready.

20:02.375 --> 20:03.941
When he is,
he can have it back.

20:03.941 --> 20:06.683
I'll keep it someplace safe
until then.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.772
Hey, Janet?

20:08.772 --> 20:11.122
You need to shut this down.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.602
What?

20:12.602 --> 20:13.864
No, of course
I didn't know that.

20:13.864 --> 20:16.258
When?

20:16.258 --> 20:19.566
Okay.
Okay, thanks for the heads up.

20:19.566 --> 20:22.264
- What'd Jordan do now?
- This wasn't about him.

20:22.264 --> 20:25.006
Turns out Luthor was released
from prison this morning.

20:25.006 --> 20:27.487
Why the hell didn't that
warden give you the heads-up?

20:27.487 --> 20:30.054
I don't know, but apparently
the press is already gathering

20:30.054 --> 20:31.839
in front of LuthorCorp.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.101
They're expecting him
to arrive any minute.

20:33.101 --> 20:34.711
We should go.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.017
Babe, I'm not gonna
fly you to Metropolis

20:36.017 --> 20:37.584
in your condition.
- I agree.

20:37.584 --> 20:39.847
Besides, you'd just be
giving Luthor what he wants:

20:39.847 --> 20:41.240
a villain to his story.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.154
Dad, I can't hide from this.

20:43.154 --> 20:45.505
It was my story that helped
send Luthor to prison.

20:45.505 --> 20:46.941
I have to face it
at some point.

20:46.941 --> 20:48.551
Yeah, and you will,
just not today.

20:48.551 --> 20:49.726
Let me know what happens.

20:49.726 --> 20:50.988
I'm gonna go see what I can do

20:50.988 --> 20:52.468
about this other
little problem.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.697
- What the hell?
- Hey! Hey!

21:22.846 --> 21:24.152
As promised.

21:29.679 --> 21:32.334
Think I should
tell my men to stop?

21:37.034 --> 21:39.298
No.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.125
We're gonna be here awhile.

22:06.934 --> 22:09.153
You wanted to speak to me?

22:12.374 --> 22:13.723
Is everything okay?

22:13.723 --> 22:16.073
I spoke to your dad
a bit ago.

22:16.073 --> 22:17.684
He seemed to think
you're getting

22:17.684 --> 22:19.686
special treatment from me.

22:19.686 --> 22:22.210
Wait, what?
That's not what I said.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.734
Look, no one's
in trouble here.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.823
And maybe I did treat you
a little bit different

22:26.823 --> 22:28.825
after everything I learned.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.132
That's on me.
Just know from here on out,

22:31.132 --> 22:34.222
that that won't happen again.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.093
All right?
You have my word on that.

22:36.093 --> 22:38.966
Okay, but I didn't say that.

22:38.966 --> 22:41.403
But the thing is, see,
everything that happens here

22:41.403 --> 22:43.927
is my responsibility.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.973
Now, I understand
why you went to your dad.

22:45.973 --> 22:49.759
I get that, but you should have
come to me first.

22:49.759 --> 22:52.196
I promise, I didn't
go and tell him.

22:52.196 --> 22:55.330
He heard me talking
and sort of just ran with it.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.811
Okay, well, from my end,

22:57.811 --> 23:00.379
I just think we need
to keep things in-house.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.468
All right,
so you got a problem,

23:02.468 --> 23:05.209
we'll handle it
right here at the station.

23:05.209 --> 23:06.210
Copy?

23:06.210 --> 23:08.604
Yes, sir.

23:08.604 --> 23:10.084
Okay.

23:14.262 --> 23:16.960
Yeah, okay,
just keep me posted.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.180
No sign of him yet.

23:19.180 --> 23:20.790
Any word
from inside LuthorCorp?

23:20.790 --> 23:22.879
Nothing, but Janet said
that people there seemed

23:22.879 --> 23:26.100
surprised that he'd been
released this morning.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.581
Why would he keep that
a secret?

23:28.581 --> 23:29.843
Dramatic effect?

23:29.843 --> 23:31.671
Build up the hype?

23:31.671 --> 23:34.761
That's not really
his style, though.

23:44.335 --> 23:46.686
Sit wherever you want.

23:46.686 --> 23:49.123
Why'd you send your mom
to talk to my parents?

23:49.123 --> 23:52.169
I didn't send her.
She just went.

23:52.169 --> 23:53.823
Now I've been grounded
from, you know...

23:53.823 --> 23:56.478
I'm sorry,
but that's not really my fault.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.570
Kind of is, though.

24:01.570 --> 24:03.529
Hey, I kept your secret, okay?

24:03.529 --> 24:05.095
Could you try
and at least not make that

24:05.095 --> 24:06.706
harder than it already is?

24:06.706 --> 24:08.490
Sorry for saving your life.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.057
Which I've tried thanking you
for multiple times,

24:10.057 --> 24:11.667
but every time,
you get all weird about it.

24:11.667 --> 24:13.669
And it's fine, whatever,
but maybe stop bragging

24:13.669 --> 24:15.715
about Smallville's
new superhero.

24:15.715 --> 24:17.194
I was sticking up for Junior.

24:17.194 --> 24:18.282
You hate Junior.

24:18.282 --> 24:19.588
You just couldn't resist

24:19.588 --> 24:21.155
talking about
how awesome you are.

24:21.155 --> 24:22.939
It wasn't like that.

24:22.939 --> 24:24.506
All I know is, that accident
almost ruined my life.

24:24.506 --> 24:26.203
And I'm trying
to make things better,

24:26.203 --> 24:28.379
and it feels like
you're trying to drag me down.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.381
Wow. All right.

24:30.381 --> 24:32.601
You know, it's impressive how
you made this all about you.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.951
It is about me. It's my life.

24:34.951 --> 24:37.867
And you're not helping,
so can you just stay out of it?

24:41.044 --> 24:42.916
That's a tornado warning.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.282
Take cover in the basement.

25:11.684 --> 25:13.424
Okay, everybody away
from the windows, now.

25:13.424 --> 25:14.817
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.340
Get away from the windows.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.429
Come on. Go, go, go, go, go.

25:44.978 --> 25:46.501
Hey! Hey!

25:46.501 --> 25:48.764
Get to the underpass
and lay down.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.592
Go! Go!

25:50.592 --> 25:52.942
Underneath!
Underneath and lay down!

25:52.942 --> 25:55.597
Hurry, hurry!

25:55.597 --> 25:58.905
Everybody down! Get down!

26:19.752 --> 26:22.189
Get down low!

26:46.735 --> 26:48.084
You shouldn't be here.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.346
I can help you.

26:49.346 --> 26:50.913
I don't need your help.

26:50.913 --> 26:53.350
Go home, Jordan.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.278
Guys, get away
from the window!

27:08.278 --> 27:10.280
Go under the desk. Hurry.

27:20.856 --> 27:22.336
Come on, let's move out!

27:28.647 --> 27:31.301
Get down low!
Get down low!

27:31.301 --> 27:32.651
Down! Get down!

28:05.901 --> 28:07.555
Thank you!

28:29.882 --> 28:32.493
Thank you. Can I get
a picture with you too?

28:43.243 --> 28:44.897
It's damn near everywhere.

28:44.897 --> 28:47.116
We may have stood a chance
before, but now with footage?

28:47.116 --> 28:48.814
By morning,
the whole world's gonna know

28:48.814 --> 28:51.294
you exist, kiddo.

28:51.294 --> 28:54.123
You completely disobeyed me.

28:54.123 --> 28:55.385
I was just trying to help.

28:55.385 --> 28:56.952
I told you
I didn't need your help.

28:56.952 --> 28:59.955
On top of that,
why didn't you just fly away?

28:59.955 --> 29:01.435
You could have disappeared

29:01.435 --> 29:03.306
before anyone realized
you were there.

29:03.306 --> 29:05.178
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

29:05.178 --> 29:07.441
You landed
right in front of them.

29:07.441 --> 29:09.095
I saved their lives.

29:09.095 --> 29:10.966
- That's--that's not the point!
- Yes, it is.

29:10.966 --> 29:13.229
So after everything
we talked about,

29:13.229 --> 29:15.841
after everything
we warned you would happen

29:15.841 --> 29:17.799
if the world found out
you existed right now,

29:17.799 --> 29:20.889
you what, you just forgot?

29:20.889 --> 29:23.544
I didn't forget, mom.

29:23.544 --> 29:25.154
I just didn't care.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.721
Well, you better
start caring.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.723
Why?
Because you're telling me to?

29:28.723 --> 29:30.072
We are your parents.

29:30.072 --> 29:31.421
So what?

29:31.421 --> 29:33.380
All your rules,

29:33.380 --> 29:36.078
hiding who I am,
telling me who I should be,

29:36.078 --> 29:37.776
I can't do it anymore.

29:37.776 --> 29:39.386
As long as you live
under this roof,

29:39.386 --> 29:41.649
you will do what your mother
and I tell you to do.

29:41.649 --> 29:43.172
- Whatever.
- Jordan!

29:43.172 --> 29:44.608
Hey!

29:54.618 --> 29:56.882
You go up to your room,

29:56.882 --> 29:59.058
and you do not come out
until we tell you to.

30:01.451 --> 30:03.671
And don't you ever
do that to me again.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.461
You gotta rein him in.

30:11.461 --> 30:13.986
He's not as careful
as you are, Clark.

30:13.986 --> 30:16.466
People see him
around town enough,

30:16.466 --> 30:18.642
track his flight paths,

30:18.642 --> 30:21.602
someone's gonna put
two and two together.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.102
Did you see it?

30:43.102 --> 30:44.799
It was a tornado.
The whole town saw it.

30:44.799 --> 30:47.541
I mean the footage
of who stopped it.

30:47.541 --> 30:48.585
Look.

30:52.372 --> 30:54.940
This proves I was right.

30:54.940 --> 30:57.725
Yeah, I guess that looks
like the person you described.

30:57.725 --> 30:59.466
You guess?

30:59.466 --> 31:00.946
Why are you acting like this?

31:00.946 --> 31:03.992
I know you saw him.

31:03.992 --> 31:06.299
Sarah, this is the guy
who saved us, all right?

31:06.299 --> 31:07.822
This is him.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.868
Don't you get it?
- Get what?

31:09.868 --> 31:11.652
It's the second time
he's shown up in Smallville,

31:11.652 --> 31:13.872
which means
he probably lives here.

31:13.872 --> 31:15.090
We might even know him.

31:28.190 --> 31:29.496
Yeah?

31:29.496 --> 31:31.977
Yo.

31:31.977 --> 31:33.543
What's up?

31:33.543 --> 31:35.415
Sick of all this crap
from Mom and Dad.

31:35.415 --> 31:37.025
Yeah.

31:37.025 --> 31:38.722
Nobody knows that
more than I do.

31:38.722 --> 31:40.376
Whatever, at least they don't
treat you like a baby

31:40.376 --> 31:41.377
all the time.

31:41.377 --> 31:44.163
Oh, really?

31:44.163 --> 31:45.947
Then why'd Dad have to talk
to Mr. Cushing

31:45.947 --> 31:47.775
about how he was going easyon me?

31:47.775 --> 31:49.342
Seriously?

31:49.342 --> 31:50.647
Yeah, he thinks
I'm some Zoomer crybaby

31:50.647 --> 31:52.649
that he can't trust anymore.

31:52.649 --> 31:54.390
So you're not the only one.

31:58.525 --> 32:00.657
Best of three?
- Sure.

32:04.748 --> 32:09.057
Yo, I gotta say, seeing you
and Dad take on that tornado

32:09.057 --> 32:10.493
looked pretty badass.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.060
You saw that?

32:12.060 --> 32:14.715
I had a decent view
from the firehouse.

32:14.715 --> 32:18.023
What's the inside of a twister
look like, anyway?

32:19.502 --> 32:23.332
If he's not gonna stop
using his powers,

32:23.332 --> 32:25.247
we need to keep him busy
doing something else.

32:25.247 --> 32:28.076
The more we push back,
the more he's gonna defy us.

32:28.076 --> 32:31.427
He's just at that stage
right now.

32:31.427 --> 32:33.777
Lex ever show up
at LuthorCorp?

32:33.777 --> 32:35.562
Doesn't look like it.

32:35.562 --> 32:37.651
Any idea where he went?

32:44.919 --> 32:48.009
- He's here.
- What?

32:50.316 --> 32:53.536
Like I said, I was gonna have
to face him at some point.

32:53.536 --> 32:56.409
Guess now is
as good a time as any.

33:00.108 --> 33:01.980
Been a long time.

33:06.549 --> 33:09.944
I see you managed to keep
your release a secret.

33:09.944 --> 33:12.164
Warden Ellis made
a few calls.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.995
Helps having powerful friends.

33:19.649 --> 33:22.522
Farm out in the country.

33:25.046 --> 33:27.962
Not what I expected from you.

33:27.962 --> 33:32.140
A lot's changed
since I went away.

33:32.140 --> 33:35.013
You got pregnant,

33:35.013 --> 33:38.451
had kids.

33:38.451 --> 33:40.061
Twins are what, 16 now?

33:40.061 --> 33:43.369
You and I are not
discussing my children.

33:43.369 --> 33:46.633
What about your cancer?

33:46.633 --> 33:47.851
Is that off-limits too?

33:47.851 --> 33:50.724
My doctors are optimistic.

33:50.724 --> 33:52.900
Funny how that worked.

33:52.900 --> 33:56.338
You got sick,

33:56.338 --> 33:59.254
and your cancer led you
to Bruno Mannheim's wife

33:59.254 --> 34:01.213
and my acquittal.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.432
I should be grateful.

34:03.432 --> 34:06.479
For what part, exactly?

34:06.479 --> 34:10.787
You should have listened
to me in the first place.

34:10.787 --> 34:14.965
I always said I was innocent.

34:14.965 --> 34:17.403
The evidence at the time
didn't support your story.

34:17.403 --> 34:19.448
I guess times have changed.

34:19.448 --> 34:22.060
What do you want?

34:22.060 --> 34:23.670
You're gonna tell me
you're sorry.

34:23.670 --> 34:26.977
Is that what you're here for?
An apology?

34:26.977 --> 34:28.240
Okay.

34:28.240 --> 34:29.806
I got it wrong, and I'm--

34:29.806 --> 34:32.983
I was innocent!

34:32.983 --> 34:35.595
17 years of my life, gone!

34:35.595 --> 34:38.032
And you think I want words?

34:38.032 --> 34:40.861
My daughter, she was 14.

34:40.861 --> 34:43.690
Now she won't talk to me.

34:43.690 --> 34:45.909
Do you think
your words can fix that?

34:45.909 --> 34:48.608
- That's enough.
- Shut your mouth!

34:48.608 --> 34:51.611
Your words are
what put me away.

34:51.611 --> 34:56.442
What I want is to never have
to read your words again.

34:56.442 --> 34:58.531
So what,
you're asking me to retire?

34:58.531 --> 35:00.315
Not asking.

35:00.315 --> 35:03.753
I'm telling you
what needs to happen.

35:03.753 --> 35:08.541
How it happens,
I don't give a damn.

35:10.586 --> 35:16.070
I was wrong
about what happened to Moxie.

35:16.070 --> 35:18.333
But I wasn't wrong
about what you are.

35:18.333 --> 35:21.728
It's easy to be brave
with Superman and the DOD

35:21.728 --> 35:23.077
watching out for you.

35:23.077 --> 35:25.775
You need to leave.

35:25.775 --> 35:28.517
Now.

35:34.001 --> 35:36.960
Well, looks like
my ride's here.

35:36.960 --> 35:40.094
Don't ever come back.

35:40.094 --> 35:42.096
Then you'd better retire.

35:53.716 --> 35:57.981
Tell Superman he's next.

35:57.981 --> 36:00.245
Right on time, Otis.

36:50.164 --> 36:52.688

Did you find Dr. Hook?

38:08.024 --> 38:09.461
And Orr was telling the truth

38:09.461 --> 38:11.376
about what he was doing
for Mannheim?

38:11.376 --> 38:13.726
The doctor confirmed it.

38:13.726 --> 38:18.513
That thing down there,
it's alive.

38:18.513 --> 38:21.516
I want to see it for myself.

38:35.878 --> 38:38.185
Hey.

38:38.185 --> 38:40.535
Sorry about earlier.

38:40.535 --> 38:42.058
It doesn't matter
now that Superboy

38:42.058 --> 38:43.582
is trending online.

38:43.582 --> 38:46.193
I saw that.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.151
You know, Junior came by
Vicky May's today

38:48.151 --> 38:49.805
and basically called me a liar.

38:49.805 --> 38:51.546
And for what,
so that Jordan could

38:51.546 --> 38:53.200
feel like a hero
for half a second?

38:53.200 --> 38:55.855
I know it's complicated,

38:55.855 --> 38:58.988
but we agreed to keep
the Kents' secret.

38:58.988 --> 39:01.643
I'm just so over it all.

39:01.643 --> 39:06.387
Hey, if you could do anything
right now, what would it be?

39:06.387 --> 39:08.520
- Get a tattoo?
- Yeah, no.

39:08.520 --> 39:11.218
Something that's
actually possible.

39:16.005 --> 39:17.964
Kind of want to dye my hair.

39:17.964 --> 39:20.488
Sweetie, everywhere's closed
right now.

39:20.488 --> 39:22.229
Then you do it.

39:22.229 --> 39:24.274
Come on, you used to color
my hair all the time.

39:24.274 --> 39:26.842
- That was years ago.
- So?

39:26.842 --> 39:30.280
Kind of want to just put
this version of me in the past.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.674
No more Jordan,
no more secrets.

39:32.674 --> 39:34.894
Okay.

39:34.894 --> 39:36.939
Let me go see what I got.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.164
I'm obviously not
quitting the "Gazette."

39:44.164 --> 39:45.644
Of course you're not.

39:45.644 --> 39:49.561
Which means he's going
to come back here.

39:49.561 --> 39:51.563
Jordan told me
what Luthor said.

39:51.563 --> 39:52.738
You know,
you really shouldn't be

39:52.738 --> 39:54.392
listening in on us.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.741
No, except maybe when
someone is threatening

39:55.741 --> 39:57.307
to kill our parents?

39:57.307 --> 39:59.919
That's not
what he said, exactly.

39:59.919 --> 40:01.790
Well, it sure sounded
like it.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.879
Listen, we knew Luthor was
gonna be a problem

40:03.879 --> 40:05.446
once he was released.

40:05.446 --> 40:08.536
What's important now
is that we're ready for...

40:08.536 --> 40:10.016
whatever he's planning.

40:10.016 --> 40:12.322
Okay.

40:12.322 --> 40:13.933
Any idea what that may be?

40:37.347 --> 40:40.263
Bruno had ambition,
I'll give him that.

40:43.310 --> 40:44.746
Be ready.

41:26.048 --> 41:28.311
How do you want to approach?

42:15.358 --> 42:18.057
Greg, move your head.
