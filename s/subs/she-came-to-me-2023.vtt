00:38.255 --> 00:41.737
[opera song]

01:12.724 --> 01:15.553
Mr. Lauddem... Mr. Lauddem.

01:15.553 --> 01:17.599
[indistinct overlapping chatter]

01:17.599 --> 01:18.687
I have the last one.

01:18.687 --> 01:20.776
- Oh, hey!
- How are you?

01:20.776 --> 01:22.865
- Hi.
- Fantastic.

01:24.127 --> 01:25.694
... that put himself
out and down.

01:25.694 --> 01:28.262
- ... I certainly can't.
- I seem to be blacklisted.

01:28.262 --> 01:29.611
Oh, my goodness.

01:29.611 --> 01:31.482
I wonder if I go to
her New Year's party...

01:31.482 --> 01:33.005
Did you hear Sumera's story
about getting caught

01:33.005 --> 01:34.137
on Shelter Island?

01:34.137 --> 01:35.530
Yes, I know,
and it was horrifying

01:35.530 --> 01:37.749
because there are absolutely
no charging stations.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.665
Oh my God. I don't think
anyone really talks about it.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.754
All these stories are coming
from that party.

01:42.754 --> 01:44.278
You're terrible.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.848
[music continues in distance]

01:57.160 --> 01:59.945
[breathing shakily]

02:01.469 --> 02:02.557
[woman whispers]: Steven?

02:05.864 --> 02:07.039
Steven?

02:09.520 --> 02:10.956
Steven?

02:11.696 --> 02:13.176
St...

02:14.308 --> 02:15.744
You're doing it again.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.573
It relaxes me.

02:20.314 --> 02:21.880
Steven,
Duftin Haverford is here.

02:21.880 --> 02:23.055
You mean Dustin.

02:23.055 --> 02:25.057
No, Duftin. Duftin Haverford.

02:25.057 --> 02:26.885
He's the head of the board
of the Troika Opera Space.

02:26.885 --> 02:28.583
I think you should say hello.
- I can't

02:28.583 --> 02:30.150
Why? Just tell him
you're making progress.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.542
[overlapping]
- I wanna go home.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.891
Do you want to keep
the commission?

02:32.891 --> 02:34.676
- Of course, I do.
- Mr. Haverford!

02:38.245 --> 02:39.463
Eye contact.

02:39.985 --> 02:42.510
Hello, so nice to meet you.
I'm Patricia Jessup-Lauddem

02:42.510 --> 02:44.251
I just wanted to introduce
you to my husband.

02:44.251 --> 02:45.904
- Steven Luaddem.
- Hello.

02:45.904 --> 02:47.993
I was hoping
we'd see you here.

02:47.993 --> 02:51.910
It's wonderful to meet you
at last. Duftin Haverford.

02:51.910 --> 02:54.261
I've been a long-time
admirer of your work.

02:54.261 --> 02:56.524
- Thank you.
- Uh, this is Frank Hall.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.395
He's our newest board member.
- So nice to meet you.

02:58.395 --> 03:00.658
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Yes, Frank.

03:00.658 --> 03:02.573
How's the new opera
coming along?

03:02.573 --> 03:03.879
- You know, okay.
- It's marvelous.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.010
Pretty good. Great, great.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.621
We had discussed

03:06.621 --> 03:09.624
seeing a first draft
of the score in two weeks.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.234
- Two weeks.
- That still all right?

03:11.234 --> 03:14.237
That...
That should be okay, right?

03:15.847 --> 03:17.414
Is he alright?

03:17.414 --> 03:18.589
He had a total breakdown

03:18.589 --> 03:20.243
after his last opera,
five years ago.

03:20.243 --> 03:23.377
Disappeared.
Stopped being able to compose,

03:24.334 --> 03:27.337
deep depression. Very deep.

03:28.817 --> 03:30.079
Then...

03:31.167 --> 03:33.778
well, if she was my therapist,
I'd marry her too.

03:33.778 --> 03:35.432
[laughing]

03:35.432 --> 03:37.260
[soft piano music]

03:37.260 --> 03:39.697
[birdsong]

04:01.110 --> 04:03.155
I wonder if we'll look
different after...

04:18.780 --> 04:20.303
[camera shutter clicks]

04:20.303 --> 04:22.392
[camera whirs]

04:35.013 --> 04:37.929
[upbeat rhythmic music]

04:42.456 --> 04:44.980
[music continues, muffled]

05:08.525 --> 05:09.918
[music plays loudly]

05:09.918 --> 05:12.050
I think I was in just
like complete auto pilot.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.052
Oh, I'm doing this all wrong.

05:14.052 --> 05:15.532
What? Bro you could
have called me.

05:15.532 --> 05:18.448
[indistinct chatter]

05:18.448 --> 05:19.928
- Ladies.
- Hey, Trey!

05:19.928 --> 05:21.538
- Hi, Mr. Ruffa.
- Hi, Mr. Ruffa.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.192
How was the battle?

05:23.192 --> 05:25.063
It went very well.
Thanks for asking.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.151
Oh, my God.

05:26.151 --> 05:28.153
- Here we go.
- Who won?

05:28.632 --> 05:31.287
Very funny.
You girls should join me

05:31.287 --> 05:32.941
one of these days.
It'd behoove you

05:32.941 --> 05:34.029
to learn some history.

05:34.029 --> 05:36.597
I'll wear a bonnet,
I'm not proud.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.033
They have free pie, right?

05:38.033 --> 05:40.209
I'm not going unless
you give me a musket.

05:40.209 --> 05:44.779
Ugh, the barrels of those
muskets were filthy today.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.520
- Really?
- These new idiots

05:46.520 --> 05:48.260
love to say they'd have been
that way historically...

05:48.260 --> 05:51.916
whereas, in actual fact,
they were cleaned every night.

05:51.916 --> 05:53.440
[distant siren wailing]

05:53.440 --> 05:54.963
They're just lazy.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.444
Pass the buns to the right.

05:58.401 --> 05:59.794
Okay, but why?

05:59.794 --> 06:01.752
You always pass
food to the right.

06:01.752 --> 06:03.275
It avoids confusion.

06:06.714 --> 06:08.716
Aren't you chilly in that?

06:10.152 --> 06:12.023
- No.
- Put your sweatshirt on.

06:12.023 --> 06:14.156
It's making me cold
just looking at you.

06:17.507 --> 06:19.074
[sighs]

06:19.074 --> 06:21.381
I need to be at the courthouse
early tomorrow.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.339
Six forty-five AM departure.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.427
That's fine.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.081
Are you working tomorrow, babe?

06:26.081 --> 06:28.213
I'll pack Tereza's
lunch tonight.

06:28.213 --> 06:31.042
- Big case?
- Parental kidnapping.

06:32.174 --> 06:37.005
Woman without custody absconded
with her son to Arkansas

06:37.484 --> 06:40.269
and the... the father
pressed charges.

06:41.096 --> 06:43.185
Looks like she's going down.

06:43.185 --> 06:44.621
How did they find her?

06:45.230 --> 06:48.016
Well... Once a serious
charge is made,

06:48.016 --> 06:51.672
you'd be surprised how fast
we can lock down the roads.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.804
[slow, gently melody]

07:00.332 --> 07:02.900
Yes, yes, yes, yes...
and then I think the act break

07:02.900 --> 07:05.816
is right after this scene.
[laughing]

07:06.948 --> 07:08.253
What?

07:09.994 --> 07:12.083
I can't do this.

07:12.344 --> 07:13.433
What do you mean?

07:14.782 --> 07:16.610
I can't get inside it.

07:17.175 --> 07:18.438
Again?!

07:19.090 --> 07:21.049
You loved this idea.

07:21.049 --> 07:22.964
I wanted to love it.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.227
That tears it.

07:26.315 --> 07:27.925
[exhales deeply]

07:30.667 --> 07:32.234
Steven I have to tell
you something.

07:33.409 --> 07:34.454
What?

07:35.759 --> 07:37.369
I've had another offer.

07:40.024 --> 07:41.504
From who?

07:41.896 --> 07:43.637
- Raef Gundel.
- Rafe...

07:43.941 --> 07:45.595
Raef Gundel!

07:46.901 --> 07:48.206
Do you hate me?

07:51.122 --> 07:53.255
Hey, Doc.
- Mm-hmm.

07:54.212 --> 07:56.258
I know it's Thursday, but...

07:57.955 --> 08:01.176
I was thinking tonight
could be a good night

08:01.176 --> 08:03.831
for sex night. Possibly.

08:05.397 --> 08:06.790
Ooh...

08:07.748 --> 08:10.881
It is an interesting idea.
But you know...

08:12.056 --> 08:13.536
Thursdays.

08:14.189 --> 08:16.496
[vacuum whirring]

08:18.628 --> 08:20.108
[vacuum stops]

08:20.108 --> 08:22.545
No, turn it back on.
[vacuum whirs]

08:22.545 --> 08:24.895
[singing vacuum note]: On...

08:26.114 --> 08:27.507
G flat.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.206
[vacuum stops]

08:34.035 --> 08:36.124
- Morning, sweetie.
- Morning.

08:36.124 --> 08:37.734
Has anybody moved this?

08:37.734 --> 08:39.257
No honey, of course not.

08:39.257 --> 08:41.259
It's definitely
closer to the window.

08:41.259 --> 08:42.696
What is that?

08:43.131 --> 08:45.568
Sort of a new take on passive
cooling and heating.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.962
We adopted the idea
from a Sub-Saharan ant.

08:47.962 --> 08:49.224
And they have these little
special hairs

08:49.224 --> 08:50.660
so that they can deflect heat.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.575
Super cool, but I don't
have time to explain.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.055
- Amazing.
- Honey before you go,

08:54.055 --> 08:55.447
I had an idea
about the Harvard essay.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.493
- Oh, I'm not applying there.
- Since when?

08:57.493 --> 08:59.060
I don't like the program.

08:59.060 --> 09:00.452
Well, I...
I think that we should...

09:00.452 --> 09:02.019
- Mom relax.
- I know, but...

09:02.019 --> 09:03.499
I know what I'm doing.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.156
- See you guys.
- What, no breakfast?

09:08.156 --> 09:10.375
- No. I need to get there early.
- Okay.

09:14.205 --> 09:15.598
[sighs]

09:15.598 --> 09:17.034
How is he so decisive?

09:17.034 --> 09:18.906
Well, he's a lot
like his father.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.648
Douglas was decisive?

09:21.648 --> 09:23.475
He was an ocular surgeon.

09:23.475 --> 09:26.043
Okay honey, I have a patient.
- What's this one for?

09:26.043 --> 09:28.742
I'm starting you on fish oil.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.439
It's not gonna get me
fish burps, is it?

09:30.439 --> 09:32.006
It says no fish burps!

09:41.842 --> 09:43.060
Ooh...

09:46.194 --> 09:49.763
Mom! Mom! I heard you.
I'm gonna put the AC unit in.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.286
And it's gonna stay
in this time, okay.

09:51.286 --> 09:53.723
I'm not gonna put it in
and take it out if it gets cold.

09:53.723 --> 09:54.768
What?

09:56.334 --> 09:58.162
[in foreign language]:
Check this again.

10:00.164 --> 10:03.646
Oh... Yeah. You're right.

10:03.646 --> 10:05.779
If you just turn it off
and then when it gets hot,

10:05.779 --> 10:07.476
you turn it back on again.
- See you later!

10:07.476 --> 10:08.390
Bye-bye, Momma.

10:08.390 --> 10:09.783
I know. I love you too.

10:09.783 --> 10:12.699
I gotta go. I gotta go bye.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.136
What you got there?
- Um, science project.

10:15.136 --> 10:18.226
- That's it?
- Oh, no...

10:18.226 --> 10:21.664
We have a Canva presentation,
and we have a model.

10:21.664 --> 10:23.579
If you went
to Saint Athanasius,

10:23.579 --> 10:25.450
you could sleep another hour
every morning,

10:25.450 --> 10:26.800
and walk to school.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.584
You know they wouldn't
let me skip any grades.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.151
Maybe they were right.

10:30.151 --> 10:31.761
You're gonna be
a baby in college now.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.371
I'll be 17!

10:33.850 --> 10:35.939
There's more than one kind
of smart, Tereza.

10:35.939 --> 10:39.856
Book smart is good,
but you need to develop

10:39.856 --> 10:41.945
a little suspicion about people.

10:42.511 --> 10:44.078
I am suspicious.

10:44.556 --> 10:46.602
What, you don't think
I'm suspicious?

10:48.691 --> 10:50.693
Please remember
to check tissue supply

10:50.693 --> 10:52.739
in office closet p--
[Steven]: Ah, God...

10:53.696 --> 10:55.829
- Honey?
- Oh, my God.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.746
Oh honey, what's the matter?

11:00.311 --> 11:03.663
Anton just texted me
he's really gone. I'm finished.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.403
Oh, I'm...
[door bell ringing]

11:05.839 --> 11:07.623
<i>[computerized voice]:
Ground floor</i>

11:08.711 --> 11:10.495
Please come in.
I'll be right down.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.412
Do you know what you need?
- A librettist.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.371
You need to take a walk.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.721
C'mon, Doc,
I walked I walked Levi

11:18.721 --> 11:20.462
15 minutes ago.
- I don't mean around the block,

11:20.462 --> 11:22.420
you need to get lost, Steven.

11:23.639 --> 11:26.250
- I hate getting lost.
- Okay, I don't mean get lost.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.817
I mean meander.

11:27.817 --> 11:30.690
You need to jolt your brain out
of its little rat pattern.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.474
Interact with a stranger.

11:32.474 --> 11:34.694
Alright?
- I don't like strangers.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.173
[whistling]

11:36.173 --> 11:37.871
C'mon. C'mon, boy.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.699
I know what I'm doing.

11:41.570 --> 11:42.745
Alright.

11:46.183 --> 11:48.272
Well, how 'bout I wait,
then you can come with me?

11:48.272 --> 11:50.666
Good boy. Oh, if I come,
I'll make all the decisions.

11:51.145 --> 11:52.537
Good boy.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.714
If you feel like turning left,
you can turn left.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.151
If you feel like turning right,
you turn right.

11:57.151 --> 12:01.416
I will be here with my phone on
in case of an emergency.

12:01.808 --> 12:02.896
And...

12:03.853 --> 12:05.420
It's good. You need this.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.508
Have fun.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.249
Okay.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.555
[traffic whirring]

12:11.774 --> 12:14.168
- He doesn't...
- He want's to go. Go on. Go on.

12:14.168 --> 12:16.518
Good Boy. Good boy.
There you go. Okay.

12:16.823 --> 12:17.911
Bye.

of these people

13:07.874 --> 13:10.790
has a story for
an opera in them, Levi.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.140
[indistinct chatter]

13:13.140 --> 13:14.837
[seagulls squaking]

13:14.837 --> 13:17.274
So, our project is gonna be
on the Saharan silver ants.

13:17.274 --> 13:21.104
And how we can use biomimicry
to improve solar panel design.

13:21.104 --> 13:23.280
These ants have evolved

13:23.280 --> 13:26.196
this very cool way
to be day foragers.

13:26.196 --> 13:28.155
The ants use their
triangular shaped hairs

13:28.155 --> 13:30.461
to reflect the heat
in multiple directions.

13:30.461 --> 13:31.854
Using biomimicry,

13:31.854 --> 13:33.247
we would have
this hyper reflective

13:33.247 --> 13:34.944
material overlayed

13:34.944 --> 13:36.598
which would decrease our need

13:36.598 --> 13:39.253
for external cooling
like air conditioning.

13:39.253 --> 13:41.255
[indistinct chatter]

13:46.477 --> 13:49.698
I'm gonna love you
for the rest of my life.

13:58.272 --> 14:01.362
Ugh... Okay, Levi,
I have to pee.

14:01.797 --> 14:04.147
We can't all just go
wherever we want, you know.

14:05.018 --> 14:08.151
You stay here. Be a good boy.

14:22.557 --> 14:24.646
Five minutes. Five minutes.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.433
Hi.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.610
Hi. Uh. Whiskey water.

14:33.350 --> 14:37.354
What kind? I got Jamesons,
Ballantine, Wild Turkey...

14:37.615 --> 14:38.878
Jameson.

14:39.400 --> 14:41.489
Uh, Ballantine. Uh...

14:44.187 --> 14:45.449
Jameson.

14:46.059 --> 14:47.234
Please.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.323
[bottle clinking]

14:55.851 --> 14:59.376
It's warmer out.
Cold still, but it's...

15:00.682 --> 15:02.379
I like the cold weather, though.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.599
It keeps the mind sharp.

15:05.382 --> 15:08.733
I eat more, though.
In the cold weather.

15:08.733 --> 15:10.170
I eat more all year.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.302
Oh yeah, what do you normally
have for breakfast?

15:14.565 --> 15:15.915
Toast.

15:27.665 --> 15:30.625
I just read you can get
Hepatitis from that.

15:30.625 --> 15:31.843
What?

15:32.366 --> 15:34.020
Communal nuts.

15:34.542 --> 15:36.761
I... I didn't
see you there.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.723
Well, here I am.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.379
You off work?

15:45.379 --> 15:46.902
Yeah, kind of.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.164
Yeah you?

15:48.164 --> 15:50.862
Yeah, got the day off.
so kickin' back.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.125
That's good.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.522
[sighs]

15:58.522 --> 15:59.697
What do you do?

16:00.698 --> 16:02.178
I operate a tugboat.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.788
You operate a tugboat?

16:05.138 --> 16:07.009
You thought they just putted
around by themselves?

16:07.009 --> 16:09.969
Oh, no. I just didn't...
I wasn't expecting that.

16:10.578 --> 16:11.579
[woman chuckles]

16:11.579 --> 16:12.841
Wow.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.539
Where do you live?

16:15.539 --> 16:16.888
On the boat.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.239
Based in Baton Rouge
at the moment,

16:19.239 --> 16:20.980
but I'm everywhere.

16:22.068 --> 16:23.678
What brings you to Brooklyn?

16:24.113 --> 16:26.289
Just towed a barge
from Jackson.

16:26.289 --> 16:27.638
Oh, yeah?

16:29.118 --> 16:30.598
What was on the barge?

16:31.251 --> 16:33.122
Salt. Grit.

16:33.122 --> 16:36.169
Airplane parts,
shower curtains.

16:36.865 --> 16:38.519
Pretty much anything
you can point a finger at

16:38.519 --> 16:41.348
has been on a barge
at one point or another.

16:42.349 --> 16:44.960
And now I can relax
and take a day.

16:47.267 --> 16:49.008
What...
What are you gonna do?

16:50.226 --> 16:51.836
After this beer,
I'm going straight out

16:51.836 --> 16:53.664
to buy some luxury shampoo.

16:53.664 --> 16:54.839
Yeah.

16:55.492 --> 16:56.885
What about you?

16:57.581 --> 16:59.757
What are you doing in a bar
at 11 o'clock in the morning?

16:59.757 --> 17:01.020
Oh, umm I'm...

17:01.629 --> 17:04.023
I'm trying to break
some patterns.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.503
It's a long story.
- I'm breaking patterns too.

17:06.503 --> 17:07.765
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.506
Well, trying to.
- That's good.

17:12.074 --> 17:14.337
- What do you do?
- Composer.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.036
A composter?

17:17.036 --> 17:19.560
[Steven chuckles]
- No, composer.

17:20.735 --> 17:23.216
Oh. What kind of music?

17:23.216 --> 17:24.782
Opera.

17:24.782 --> 17:27.611
Oh, you mean like... Ahh...

17:27.611 --> 17:28.786
Yes.

17:28.786 --> 17:30.005
[singing]: Yes...

17:30.005 --> 17:31.311
[woman chuckles]

17:33.443 --> 17:36.794
I'm suffering from a temporary
blockage at the moment, though.

17:37.404 --> 17:38.927
That's too bad.

17:38.927 --> 17:40.624
Ever since I was a little kid,

17:40.624 --> 17:42.191
I wasn't good
at anything but music,

17:42.191 --> 17:45.412
and now, I'm not even
good for that. So...

17:46.935 --> 17:49.242
I teach composition too.

17:49.242 --> 17:53.289
But I'm taking the semester off
while I... write.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.597
[stammers]
How long you been a tug captain?

17:56.597 --> 17:58.120
A long time.

17:59.513 --> 18:02.298
Whad'ya gotta do
to become a tug captain?

18:02.298 --> 18:06.694
My family was in tugs
growing up and then, um...

18:07.695 --> 18:09.523
After my illness, I...

18:11.612 --> 18:14.963
What? What... illness?

18:15.746 --> 18:17.748
- Want to see my boat?
- No, thanks.

18:17.748 --> 18:20.795
That's crazy. I can't do that.

18:22.579 --> 18:23.972
Yeah, okay.

18:24.451 --> 18:27.845
[woman]: Here she is!
You gotta put this on.

18:30.979 --> 18:33.677
[gentle music]

18:39.466 --> 18:40.858
I got him.

18:41.511 --> 18:42.904
I got you.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.949
I got you.
[clicking tongue]

18:45.994 --> 18:47.952
You want the royal treatment?

18:47.952 --> 18:49.867
[clicking tongue]

18:50.825 --> 18:53.132
I grew up on this tug.

18:55.917 --> 18:57.614
My dad rebuilt it.

18:58.006 --> 19:00.139
Growing up, I was a deck hand,

19:00.965 --> 19:03.229
But...
[chuckles]

19:03.229 --> 19:04.882
... hated living on the boat.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.057
[chuckles]

19:06.057 --> 19:08.147
All I wanted to do
was live on dry land

19:08.147 --> 19:10.758
and not smell like diesel.

19:10.758 --> 19:13.108
Then my dad had an accident.

19:13.108 --> 19:14.153
See this axe?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.545
[Levi whimpers]

19:15.545 --> 19:17.982
This is cut the line
in case of an emergency.

19:17.982 --> 19:21.116
Axes all over the boat.
Little good it did him.

19:22.987 --> 19:25.207
- Sorry.
- Can I show you around?

19:29.777 --> 19:31.953
[birds tweeting]

19:34.608 --> 19:36.392
This is the galley.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.916
Alright, we have to be
kind of quiet.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.701
'Cause the crew's asleep.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.224
How many people in your crew?

19:42.224 --> 19:44.400
Ah... three to six, depending.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.969
Right now there's the engineer,
that's Pete.

19:47.969 --> 19:49.536
He was in jail for a stretch.

19:49.536 --> 19:50.667
For what?

19:50.667 --> 19:53.017
Murder, but you'd
never know it.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.454
He's the best.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.107
And then there's Dess,
and there's Rory.

19:56.107 --> 19:58.545
The mate and the... deckhand.

19:58.545 --> 20:00.111
[organ playing]

20:00.111 --> 20:02.810
Shh! Shh! My God.
[laughing]

20:02.810 --> 20:03.985
[whispering]:
That's Aunt Moxie's.

20:03.985 --> 20:05.247
That's my father's sister.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.727
She cooks and all.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.817
Isn't she a bombshell?

20:10.600 --> 20:12.385
Want to see the wheel house?

20:12.385 --> 20:14.343
You better tie up Levi.

20:16.650 --> 20:17.999
Come here, bud.

20:17.999 --> 20:19.305
Sorry, buddy.

20:20.871 --> 20:23.134
[birds tweeting]

20:28.444 --> 20:30.446
It's right up here.

20:34.929 --> 20:36.235
How long are the shifts?

20:37.192 --> 20:39.499
Six hours on, six hours off.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.414
Switch off with the mate.

20:41.805 --> 20:46.027
But since I live here...
always doing something.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.725
And you run
this whole thing, huh?

20:48.725 --> 20:49.987
That's a responsibility.

20:49.987 --> 20:52.251
Yeah... Yeah, you gotta
be on your game.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.949
In the wrong hands,
this tug is a deadly weapon.

20:54.949 --> 20:56.385
It's 80 tons of steel.

20:56.690 --> 20:57.908
Life or death.

20:59.083 --> 21:00.607
I'm an owner-operator.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.652
Katrina is not part
of a big corporation.

21:02.652 --> 21:05.133
Let's say you need to get
some scrap metal to Texas.

21:05.133 --> 21:07.135
You can't fly it,
you can't truck it.

21:07.135 --> 21:08.223
You need a tug.

21:08.223 --> 21:09.659
Sometimes I work
for the navy

21:09.659 --> 21:11.487
hauling scrap.

21:11.487 --> 21:14.273
My sister and me
shared this bunk.

21:15.404 --> 21:18.146
But, um... it's double sized.

21:18.799 --> 21:21.018
Three more berths for the crew.

21:21.018 --> 21:22.759
[door creaks]

21:24.195 --> 21:27.416
If need be,
I could sleep up to 12.

21:31.333 --> 21:33.117
[inhaling]

21:35.076 --> 21:36.860
I love vanilla.

21:38.558 --> 21:40.908
It certainly is pungent.

21:47.828 --> 21:49.482
I have to remember to rest.

21:51.397 --> 21:54.617
And what exactly
are you recovering from?

21:54.617 --> 21:56.837
If you don't mind my asking.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.623
I'm addicted to romance.

22:01.363 --> 22:03.191
Well, isn't everybody?

22:04.801 --> 22:06.890
It's a recognized syndrome.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.633
But isn't it considered
healthy these days

22:10.633 --> 22:12.809
for women to rut like men?

22:12.809 --> 22:14.942
[Katrina chuckles]
- No.

22:14.942 --> 22:19.555
This isn't just sleeping
around. And...

22:20.295 --> 22:21.601
It's pretty bad.

22:21.601 --> 22:23.429
I've been arrested
for stalking.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.082
Had to go to rehab.

22:25.909 --> 22:27.520
And, uh...

22:27.520 --> 22:29.696
I'm not supposed
to be doing this.

22:29.696 --> 22:30.827
[laughing]

22:30.827 --> 22:32.829
Going to a bar,

22:32.829 --> 22:35.876
taking a guy back to the boat
is a real no no.

22:35.876 --> 22:37.878
But I just really
couldn't help myself

22:37.878 --> 22:39.488
because you're very handsome.

22:39.488 --> 22:42.578
So you went to the bar today
specifically so you could...

22:42.578 --> 22:45.276
- Meet someone.
- ... meet someone.

22:48.149 --> 22:50.673
Well. It's been
a real revelation

22:50.673 --> 22:52.458
meeting you today, Katrina. I...

22:52.458 --> 22:54.285
- Oh...
- I should get out more often.

22:54.285 --> 22:56.026
- That's what this--
- Why don't I make you

22:56.026 --> 22:57.680
a cup of tea?
It's just one cup of tea.

22:57.680 --> 22:58.812
Ah...

22:58.812 --> 23:00.422
- Ah...
- Ah...

23:00.770 --> 23:02.729
And then off with you.

23:02.729 --> 23:04.731
Back to the opera
that you're not writing.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.341
[Steven chuckles]

23:07.081 --> 23:08.778
Sure, okay.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.868
Okay, stay right there.
I'll bring it in.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.043
Okay.

23:14.349 --> 23:16.177
[door creaks]

23:20.268 --> 23:22.357
[Steven groans]

23:22.357 --> 23:24.620
Uh, I usually have
a salami sandwich, by the way.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.274
If you're interested.
- What?

23:26.274 --> 23:27.710
For breakfast.

23:27.710 --> 23:29.799
I heard you ask
the bartender.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.545
Wow.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.722
[door creaks]

23:42.116 --> 23:43.987
Oh, thank you.

23:45.685 --> 23:47.164
What is that?

23:47.164 --> 23:48.296
It's fennel.

23:48.949 --> 23:51.865
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.432
I love this cabin.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.521
Sometimes I look around and I...

23:56.696 --> 24:00.439
can't believe how lucky
I am to have this life.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.793
You haven't looked at me yet.

24:06.793 --> 24:09.404
- Yes, I have.
- Not in the eyes.

24:15.715 --> 24:19.414
[soft music]

24:49.009 --> 24:50.314
Wait.

25:28.048 --> 25:31.051
[soft opera music]

25:52.115 --> 25:55.031
Well, let's go back
to what we know.

25:55.031 --> 25:58.426
Bruna got very upset
with me this morning.

25:58.948 --> 26:02.778
She said I... hung up
my towel too crumpled.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.388
Mmm.

26:05.912 --> 26:07.696
How did that make you feel?

26:07.696 --> 26:08.958
Guilty.

26:09.872 --> 26:11.178
Angry.

26:14.137 --> 26:16.792
I... I keep imagining
you naked.

26:17.445 --> 26:19.839
I thought that was going
to go away eventually.

26:20.622 --> 26:22.145
Transference comes and goes.

26:22.145 --> 26:24.539
Is it... like,
if I'm seeing you naked

26:24.539 --> 26:27.150
in an indoor setting versus
an outdoor setting in my mind.

26:27.150 --> 26:29.022
I don't know if you want
to hear more details about...

26:29.022 --> 26:30.066
these images.

26:30.066 --> 26:31.415
- No.
- Okay.

26:31.415 --> 26:33.026
That's fair.
- Thank you.

26:33.026 --> 26:34.593

40:33.300 --> 40:34.823
- Faster.
- ...three new robotic dogs

40:34.823 --> 40:36.521
to search and rescue services.

40:36.521 --> 40:39.480
The dogs created by
engineering firm PCL Dynamics

40:39.480 --> 40:41.439
are controlled remotely
by a live operator.

40:41.439 --> 40:43.658
They'll be implemented into
the force in the coming weeks.

40:43.658 --> 40:45.660
The robotic K9's will also
be able to detect potential.

40:45.660 --> 40:47.445
gas leaks and determine
structural integrity

40:47.445 --> 40:49.272

or collapse.

40:59.108 --> 41:01.023
Aye, aye, aye.

41:03.896 --> 41:06.072
- No mistakes.
- Wow.

41:06.072 --> 41:07.552
How can we tell that
you haven't made

41:07.552 --> 41:09.728
any mistakes, though?
We don't understand short hand.

41:10.337 --> 41:11.860
I never lie.
That's how you tell.

41:11.860 --> 41:13.601
I've never seen anyone
move their fingers that fast.

41:13.601 --> 41:15.951
And I know just
about enough legaleze

41:15.951 --> 41:18.998
to represent myself in court,
should the need arise.

41:19.912 --> 41:22.218

I'm typing in court,

41:22.218 --> 41:23.742
it's all I can do
to stop myself

41:23.742 --> 41:26.005
from saying to one
of the lawyers,

41:26.571 --> 41:28.573
don't you want to object here?
[chuckles]

41:29.661 --> 41:31.532
You must see some
really interesting cases.

41:31.532 --> 41:33.882

passed through these ears.

41:34.753 --> 41:37.451
And I don't forget anything, unfortunately.

41:40.585 --> 41:42.108
This cake is delicious.

41:42.108 --> 41:43.936
- Have more.
- Sure.

41:43.936 --> 41:45.807
We shouldn't have done
this on a school night, huh?

41:45.807 --> 41:48.680
Now you'll have homework
deep into the night.

41:51.160 --> 41:53.336
Guess I better get going. Um...

41:53.336 --> 41:55.121
Can I help you with the dishes?
- No, no.

41:55.121 --> 41:57.776
Okay, well, thank you.

41:57.776 --> 42:00.082
It was nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you too.

I can't help it.

Am I being stupid?

How old is Julian?

43:44.360 --> 43:46.319
Eighteen. He just
had his birthday.

I wish you hadn't have
shown me these, Magdalena.

43:51.803 --> 43:54.936
I know it's hard
to see her like this.

43:54.936 --> 43:57.243
We think of her
as a little girl.

43:59.114 --> 44:00.942
You know what this is?

44:00.942 --> 44:02.814
This could be probable cause.

44:03.510 --> 44:05.207
What is "probable cause?"

44:05.207 --> 44:07.427
Reasonable grounds
for pressing a charge.

44:07.427 --> 44:08.558
A charge?

44:08.558 --> 44:11.344
The definition
for statutory rape is,

44:11.344 --> 44:13.912
"penetration, however slight".

44:13.912 --> 44:15.827
But Tereza consented
to this sex.

44:21.963 --> 44:23.617

You know what I mean.

44:39.111 --> 44:40.808
She is not your daughter.

44:40.808 --> 44:43.376
Oh, okay, so she's not
my daughter now.

44:43.376 --> 44:46.858
I legally adopted her,

We may not be married,
but I am her father.

54:05.851 --> 54:06.982
Well...

54:06.982 --> 54:08.810
Okay. Here's what
we're gonna...

54:10.595 --> 54:11.813
Oh!

54:12.379 --> 54:13.511
Oh!

54:15.164 --> 54:16.601
Damn it!
- Sorry, Doc!

54:16.601 --> 54:17.689
- Steven!
- I'm sorry!

54:17.689 --> 54:19.212
- C'mon!
- I...

54:19.212 --> 54:21.083
Just c'mon!

54:22.302 --> 54:24.826
It's the one thing. One thing!
- I'm sorry.

54:55.248 --> 54:56.336
Hey.

54:59.731 --> 55:01.123
What's the matter?

55:05.954 --> 55:08.043
I was thinking...

55:09.175 --> 55:10.916
When Julian graduates...

55:11.743 --> 55:13.701
We could give away the house.

55:13.701 --> 55:14.876
Okay.

55:15.660 --> 55:17.879
Wait, why you want
to sell the house?

55:17.879 --> 55:21.274
We could donate it
to the church. It could...

55:22.319 --> 55:24.799
It could be a home
for mothers and children.

55:24.799 --> 55:27.149
What? Where would...
Where would we live?

55:27.149 --> 55:30.239
[breathing deeply]

55:30.239 --> 55:33.547
Some nice empty apartment.

[light piano music]

55:53.611 --> 55:55.526
Oh, hello. Hi.
- Oh, hello, Patricia.

55:55.526 --> 55:58.137
Um, I have some more
things to donate.

55:58.137 --> 55:59.834
Oh. Okay.

55:59.834 --> 56:02.054
Thank you so much.
- They look new.

56:02.054 --> 56:03.360
Okay.

56:04.448 --> 56:06.493
Here, you can put them
down right here.

56:06.493 --> 56:07.668
Of course, thank you.

56:07.668 --> 56:10.541
Alright... anything else?

56:12.194 --> 56:13.631
Can I help?

56:13.892 --> 56:16.634
Why sure. Yeah, come help us
with the snacks. Okay.

56:18.200 --> 56:19.376
What would you like?

58:29.375 --> 58:30.637
What?

58:30.637 --> 58:32.378
How did you get those?

58:32.378 --> 58:34.859
Your mother found them.
And she was shocked.

58:36.513 --> 58:37.731
Okay.

58:38.253 --> 58:40.560
Yeah, we... Julian and I,
we have sex.

58:40.560 --> 58:42.519
So what? It's not a big deal.

58:44.172 --> 58:45.565
It's fine.

58:45.565 --> 58:47.132
We use protection.

58:49.482 --> 58:51.266
What more do you want?

58:52.877 --> 58:54.531
You people are so weird.

You can go to your room now.

- What was that?

58:58.622 --> 58:59.884
Are you recording me?

58:59.884 --> 59:01.320
- Too late.
- What the...

59:01.320 --> 59:02.626
- The law is the law.
- What?

59:02.626 --> 59:03.714
Same rules for everyone.

59:03.714 --> 59:05.803
You're 16, he's 18.
- Right.

59:05.803 --> 59:07.413
That's sexual misconduct.

59:07.413 --> 59:10.024
Class A misdemeanor.
Case closed.

59:10.590 --> 59:12.549
Are you trying
to get him arrested?

59:13.898 --> 59:15.900
He made a big mistake.

Get out of my room.

59:39.271 --> 59:41.273
I have nothing to say
to you right now.

59:43.449 --> 59:45.582
I showed him the pictures...

59:47.322 --> 59:49.020
because I was frightened
for you, and...

59:49.020 --> 59:50.804
and angry, that you
had made such a step

59:50.804 --> 59:52.110
without telling me.

59:53.633 --> 59:54.765
My jewel.

59:54.765 --> 59:56.593
[crying]

59:58.072 --> 01:00:01.510
You know, you love
to call me your jewel.

01:00:02.337 --> 01:00:04.470
As if I'm some thing.

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:07.647
Like I'm some performing robot.

Who just gets A's
to make you feel better

01:00:09.823 --> 01:00:11.520
about your wasted life.

01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.131
I would never imagine
Trey would do this.

01:00:13.131 --> 01:00:14.959
I guess you don't know him
very well then, either.

01:00:14.959 --> 01:00:16.656
It will be over soon.
He will drop this.

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:18.179
No, he won't!

01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:22.314
He's never admitted
he's been wrong about anything

01:00:22.314 --> 01:00:24.229
in his entire life.

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:27.406
He's a pompous
little racist dictator,

01:00:27.406 --> 01:00:28.668
and you're his deputy.

01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:30.061
Don't speak to me like this!

01:00:30.061 --> 01:00:32.019
Do you understand

01:00:32.019 --> 01:00:33.368
that if this happens,

01:00:33.368 --> 01:00:34.979
Julian will have to walk around

01:00:34.979 --> 01:00:36.937
in every neighborhood
he lives in

01:00:36.937 --> 01:00:38.722
for the rest of his life

01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:41.855
explaining that
he's a child molester?

01:00:41.855 --> 01:00:44.902
You'll have fucking ruined him.

01:00:47.295 --> 01:00:49.820
I will make this right, Tereza.

01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:51.691
[chuckles]
- Really.

01:00:52.474 --> 01:00:53.824
How?

01:00:57.218 --> 01:00:58.176
Get out.

01:01:16.281 --> 01:01:17.674
But could I still
be arrested?

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:19.545
I don't think
they'll make an arrest.

01:01:20.372 --> 01:01:22.504
unless the girl comes in
and makes a victim statement.

01:01:22.504 --> 01:01:24.028
Tereza would never do that.

01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:26.247
But I don't like that
the step father

01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:28.989
has probable cause
with that phone video recording

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:30.425
and the images.

01:01:31.470 --> 01:01:33.777
They could keep the case open
for months if he knows people.

01:01:33.777 --> 01:01:35.300
I can't believe it.

01:01:35.996 --> 01:01:37.432
Your whole life,
we worry about the police,

01:01:37.432 --> 01:01:39.478
and then you get framed
by a stenographer.

01:01:39.913 --> 01:01:43.264
Well, technically,
he wasn't framed, he was caught.

01:01:43.743 --> 01:01:44.788
Harry...

01:01:45.527 --> 01:01:46.964
Are we sure the step father

01:01:46.964 --> 01:01:48.661
won't just drop it?
- No.

01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:50.619
Harry, this is not a strategy.

01:01:51.142 --> 01:01:53.100
Julian is about
to go to college.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:54.885
There has to be
something we can do

01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:56.756
to nip this thing in the bud,
once and for all.

01:01:56.756 --> 01:01:58.192
Nip this in the bud?

01:01:58.976 --> 01:02:00.412
Mom, this is not a rose bush.

01:02:00.412 --> 01:02:01.935
This is the United States
Legal system

01:02:01.935 --> 01:02:03.197
and now I'm in it.

01:02:03.502 --> 01:02:05.156
- I wish you'd never met her.
- Stop it!

01:02:05.156 --> 01:02:06.766
It's not Tereza's fault.
You told me

01:02:06.766 --> 01:02:08.420
to tell you when I'm not fine!

01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:09.508
Okay.

01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:12.729
This is what
not fine looks like!

01:02:18.517 --> 01:02:20.171
What if they got married?

01:02:21.955 --> 01:02:24.218
Steven. What the...

01:02:25.132 --> 01:02:26.568
Would that help?

01:02:26.568 --> 01:02:28.048
Well, the crime would still
have been committed

01:02:28.048 --> 01:02:29.615
before the marriage, but...

01:02:29.615 --> 01:02:31.182
sure, in theory,
it would make it

01:02:31.182 --> 01:02:33.053
much less likely to go to trial.

01:02:33.053 --> 01:02:35.099
- Ah...
- But it's moot.

01:02:35.099 --> 01:02:37.275
A 16-year-old girl
cannot legally marry

01:02:37.275 --> 01:02:38.755

Wait.

You can get married in Delaware

01:03:14.312 --> 01:03:15.835
at 16 with parental consent.

01:03:17.141 --> 01:03:19.360
How am I supposed
to get parental consent?

I'm under house arrest.

01:03:24.235 --> 01:03:25.584
Okay...

01:03:26.890 --> 01:03:28.935
But let's say
we worked it out somehow.

01:03:28.935 --> 01:03:30.328
Would you want to?

01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:32.983
Totally.

01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:37.161
Would you?

01:03:40.425 --> 01:03:41.818
I mean,
statistically speaking,

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.602
we don't have much
of a chance of making it.

01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:45.952
True.

01:03:47.867 --> 01:03:50.304
But, statistically,

01:03:50.304 --> 01:03:52.916
someone who gets married
at our age has to make it,

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:54.308
so...

01:03:54.308 --> 01:03:55.832
Might as well be us.

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:59.574
If we're normal, and wait,
we'll probably break up.

01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.663
Then meet new people,
and marry them,

01:04:01.663 --> 01:04:03.578
when we're like
thirties or something.

01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:06.190
Yeah, that's what happens.

01:04:07.974 --> 01:04:09.933
But even if my wife
is really nice...

01:04:09.933 --> 01:04:12.239
Yeah, I hate your nice wife.

What does it look
like I'm doing?

01:04:46.447 --> 01:04:47.884
It looks like
you're following me.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.798
I-I wish you wouldn't.
I have an important meeting.

01:04:49.798 --> 01:04:51.626
Well, I wouldn't follow you
if you just calm down

01:04:51.626 --> 01:04:53.933
and act like
a person for a change.

01:04:54.586 --> 01:04:55.674
Look.

Art can come
from many different places.

01:04:58.285 --> 01:04:59.721
And it can even
come from a mistake.

01:04:59.721 --> 01:05:02.202
And that's, I'm sorry to say,
all we had together.

01:05:02.202 --> 01:05:04.901
I made a mistake.
You are not my muse.

01:05:05.379 --> 01:05:06.685
You alarm me.

01:05:07.555 --> 01:05:09.688
Well, what about your show?

01:05:09.688 --> 01:05:11.995
Would that have even been
possible without me?

01:05:11.995 --> 01:05:14.562
- No.
- So why aren't I your muse?

01:05:14.562 --> 01:05:15.650
Okay, you're my muse!

01:05:15.650 --> 01:05:17.565
Oh! I knew I was your muse!

01:05:17.565 --> 01:05:21.221
But it was just that one time,
it's nothing personal.

01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:22.962
Nothing personal?

Ugh!

01:05:28.489 --> 01:05:31.014
Yes, our time together
was an inspiration.

01:05:31.014 --> 01:05:33.190
You gave me the character
I based my opera on.

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:35.322
But my imagination
came up with the story.

Well, I haven't yet.

01:05:42.764 --> 01:05:43.983
Why can't you just admit

01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:46.420
that I had a magic
affect on you?

01:05:47.334 --> 01:05:49.989
Or that we had a magic
effect on each other.

01:06:44.304 --> 01:06:45.392
Hi.

01:06:45.392 --> 01:06:46.611
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:48.047
Did you have trouble
finding the place?

01:06:48.047 --> 01:06:50.310
No. Not at all. I... I...

01:06:50.310 --> 01:06:51.833
I got... I gave myself
plenty of time.

01:06:51.833 --> 01:06:53.792
I got here early.
I've just been...

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:55.446
circling the block.

01:06:55.446 --> 01:06:57.230
Oh, you really wanted
to get here.

01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:58.536
I sure did.

01:06:58.536 --> 01:07:00.886
You're so pretty, huh...

01:07:00.886 --> 01:07:02.975
Uh... Th-Thank you.

01:07:03.497 --> 01:07:06.065
Well, why don't we
sit down and talk?

01:07:08.589 --> 01:07:10.243
Why don't you tell me
why you're here?

01:07:10.243 --> 01:07:11.462
[sighs]

01:07:11.462 --> 01:07:12.811
I was in rehab for sex

01:07:12.811 --> 01:07:14.552
and love addiction
and it didn't work.

01:07:14.552 --> 01:07:15.683
Hmm.

01:07:15.683 --> 01:07:16.945
How do you know it didn't work?

01:07:16.945 --> 01:07:18.208
I'm in love.

01:07:19.513 --> 01:07:20.862
Well...

01:07:20.862 --> 01:07:22.908
Love isn't always a disease.

01:07:22.908 --> 01:07:24.562
Sometimes it's really just...

01:07:24.562 --> 01:07:26.085
[breathes deeply]

01:07:26.085 --> 01:07:27.478
...love.

01:07:28.348 --> 01:07:32.004
Well... I mean, I'm obsessive.

01:07:32.004 --> 01:07:33.832
I've been known
to stalk a little.

01:07:33.832 --> 01:07:36.443
I'm not so interested
in past diagnoses.

01:07:36.443 --> 01:07:38.619
I don't want to pre-judge.

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:40.186
Oh, that's so nice.

01:07:40.186 --> 01:07:41.753
Tell me about your childhood.

01:07:43.189 --> 01:07:45.278
Well, I grew up on a...

01:07:47.019 --> 01:07:48.455
a very, uh...

01:07:49.978 --> 01:07:52.677
confined space.

01:07:53.765 --> 01:07:55.245
- Mmm.
- And...

01:07:55.245 --> 01:07:57.203
I watched a lot
of romantic movies

01:07:57.203 --> 01:07:59.162
where the man would come in

01:07:59.162 --> 01:08:02.121
and sweep the woman
right off her feet.

01:08:02.948 --> 01:08:04.732
One day, a movie was being shot

01:08:04.732 --> 01:08:07.126
in a town that I was based in.

01:08:07.126 --> 01:08:09.868
- Exciting.
- And the lead...

01:08:09.868 --> 01:08:13.001
was someone I had seen
in a lot of these movies.

01:08:13.001 --> 01:08:16.353
So, I thought it was my destiny
to be married to him.

01:08:16.353 --> 01:08:18.311
Ah.

01:08:18.311 --> 01:08:19.356
And...

01:08:20.444 --> 01:08:23.099
one day,
I snuck into his trailer

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:26.363
and took off all my clothes
and waited for him

01:08:26.363 --> 01:08:27.842
and he came in,

01:08:27.842 --> 01:08:30.149
and he turned around
and he walked right back out

01:08:30.149 --> 01:08:32.108
and he called the cops,

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.545
and I got arrested,

01:08:34.545 --> 01:08:36.547
and the court said

01:08:36.547 --> 01:08:39.854
that I had to go into rehab
for sex and love addiction.

01:08:40.464 --> 01:08:42.553
And I did.
I went into treatment.

01:08:42.553 --> 01:08:44.468
And the councilor said

01:08:44.468 --> 01:08:48.211
that I shouldn't watch
romantic movies for a year.

01:08:48.211 --> 01:08:50.256
Which I didn't.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.563
And...

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.479
I thought I was cured.

01:08:56.784 --> 01:08:59.613
And then I came
to New York for work.

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:02.573
Um, what do you do?

01:09:04.401 --> 01:09:06.142
I'm a tug captain.

01:09:07.317 --> 01:09:09.667
[light piano music]

01:09:22.854 --> 01:09:25.335
[crying]

01:09:28.251 --> 01:09:30.470
[panting]

01:09:36.476 --> 01:09:37.608
Doc!

01:09:38.086 --> 01:09:39.349
Pat!

01:09:40.959 --> 01:09:42.178
Pat!

01:09:53.232 --> 01:09:54.929
Pat-ty!

01:09:54.929 --> 01:09:56.844
Doc-ah, Doc-ah, Doc...

01:09:58.455 --> 01:10:00.761
I got the commission.
[laughs]

01:10:00.761 --> 01:10:02.023
That's nice.

01:10:02.981 --> 01:10:04.156
Yeah.

01:10:04.896 --> 01:10:07.855
They want something
about aliens. No Gravity!

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.728
And Anton is going
to write the story.

01:10:14.297 --> 01:10:15.428
What the...?

01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:18.431
What do you need?

01:10:18.779 --> 01:10:19.998
I don't know.
Where's the kettle?

01:10:19.998 --> 01:10:21.434
I'm giving it away.

01:10:22.653 --> 01:10:25.046
- Why?
- I'm going to become a nun.

01:10:25.917 --> 01:10:27.788
- A nun?
- Yes.

01:10:27.788 --> 01:10:29.660
I've been curious
for a very long time

01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.531
and I recently received
a vocation.

01:10:34.142 --> 01:10:35.405
Oh...
[clears throat]

01:10:35.405 --> 01:10:37.668
Your tugboat captain
came to see me.

01:10:52.422 --> 01:10:54.119
She's in love with you.

01:10:55.468 --> 01:10:56.948
No. Not really.

01:10:57.818 --> 01:10:59.951
I think she is, actually.

01:11:04.085 --> 01:11:05.652
Um...

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.176
I think maybe I'll give up

01:11:08.176 --> 01:11:10.614
on myself
as a human being and...

01:11:10.614 --> 01:11:13.399
just go live in a room
somewhere and write music.

01:11:14.835 --> 01:11:16.359
Okay.

01:11:17.055 --> 01:11:19.057
Could you also
remove your piano?

01:11:32.157 --> 01:11:34.246
[exhales deeply]

01:11:35.029 --> 01:11:36.553
Oh! Hi, Carl.

01:11:36.814 --> 01:11:38.337
I let myself in.

01:11:38.337 --> 01:11:41.122
You were so late,
and the door was open.

01:11:42.472 --> 01:11:43.951
Uh-huh. Good.

01:11:44.517 --> 01:11:46.476
I'm upset that you're late.

01:11:46.476 --> 01:11:47.694
Uh-huh.

01:11:48.478 --> 01:11:50.218
Reminds me of my mother.

01:11:51.089 --> 01:11:53.744
My mother was late
for everything.

01:11:53.744 --> 01:11:54.919
Alright...

01:11:54.919 --> 01:11:57.313
And so is Bruna.

01:11:57.878 --> 01:11:59.271
Carl...

01:12:00.925 --> 01:12:03.319
Have I ever told you
the story of the kreplach?

01:12:04.494 --> 01:12:05.756
What's the kreplach?

01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:07.758
It's a sort of Jewish dumpling

01:12:07.758 --> 01:12:09.107
with a little bit meat inside.

01:12:09.107 --> 01:12:11.022
But it's in the shape
of a triangle.

01:12:11.805 --> 01:12:14.460
Uh, okay, um...
no, you haven't.

01:12:14.460 --> 01:12:17.202
No? Okay.
So there's this little boy,

01:12:17.202 --> 01:12:20.161
and he is terrified of kreplach.

01:12:20.161 --> 01:12:22.207
He only has
to see one at Shabat,

01:12:22.207 --> 01:12:23.817
and he runs screaming
from the room.

01:12:23.817 --> 01:12:27.255
So, his mother takes him
to a psychiatrist.

01:12:27.255 --> 01:12:29.170
And she says
"Doctor, what am I gonna do?

01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:31.956
What am I...
he's terrified of kreplach."

01:12:33.174 --> 01:12:34.959
And the shrink says,
"It's very simple.

01:12:34.959 --> 01:12:36.830
It's very simple.
You just show him

01:12:36.830 --> 01:12:40.965
each and every step
to making a kreplach...

01:12:41.748 --> 01:12:43.402
He won't be afraid it anymore.

01:12:43.402 --> 01:12:46.187
So she takes
the little boy home.

01:12:46.753 --> 01:12:48.581
She mixes up the dough with him.

01:12:48.581 --> 01:12:50.409
She rolls out the dough.
She says,

01:12:50.409 --> 01:12:53.020
"See? I'm rolling
out the dough. Okay?"

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:56.328
The boy says "No problem, Mama."

01:12:57.024 --> 01:12:59.505
Then she cuts the dough

01:12:59.505 --> 01:13:02.160
into a triangle shape.
Says, "Okay?"

01:13:02.508 --> 01:13:03.901
He's fine with it.

01:13:03.901 --> 01:13:06.512
She puts in the little
knob of meat.

01:13:06.512 --> 01:13:10.211
"See?" She says, little meat
I'm putting in. Okay?"

01:13:10.211 --> 01:13:12.736
The boy says, "Fine."

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.260
Then...

01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.959
she folds over
the first corner of dough.

01:13:19.612 --> 01:13:21.179
"Okay?"

01:13:21.179 --> 01:13:24.269
"Okay." Another corner.

01:13:24.269 --> 01:13:25.792
"Okay?"

01:13:25.792 --> 01:13:27.446
"Okay."

01:13:27.446 --> 01:13:29.100
Everything fine.

01:13:33.583 --> 01:13:35.411
She folds over
the last corner of the dough

01:13:35.411 --> 01:13:37.543
to complete the dumpling,

01:13:39.545 --> 01:13:40.938
and the boy...

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:44.463
screams!

01:13:44.463 --> 01:13:47.466
[shrieking]

01:13:47.466 --> 01:13:52.645
"Kreplach!"

01:14:01.262 --> 01:14:03.264
Sister, thank you for coming.

01:14:03.264 --> 01:14:05.876
Pat is anxious to see you.

01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:07.268
Of course.

01:14:08.618 --> 01:14:11.272
She's had a hard day.

01:14:11.577 --> 01:14:13.361
Let's go in the other room.

01:14:13.361 --> 01:14:14.450
Okay.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:18.454
I didn't know how much
pressure she'd been under.

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:19.498
Yeah.

01:14:20.151 --> 01:14:22.414
But she'll be okay.
She'll be okay.

01:14:22.414 --> 01:14:24.111
I talked to her psychiatrist.

01:14:24.111 --> 01:14:26.853
And, uh... he thinks
that she needs treatment

01:14:26.853 --> 01:14:28.333
and rest for a few weeks,

01:14:28.333 --> 01:14:29.769
and then she'll be fine.

01:14:29.769 --> 01:14:31.423
And you know, of course,

01:14:31.423 --> 01:14:34.295
I'll do everything I can
to help you.

01:14:36.820 --> 01:14:40.171
But I'm sorry to say this...

01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:43.609
I don't think your mom and I
are going to make it.

01:14:43.609 --> 01:14:44.828
You're leaving?

01:14:45.524 --> 01:14:46.873
No... No.

01:14:46.873 --> 01:14:49.746
I just, I can't blame Pat
for throwing me out.

01:14:49.746 --> 01:14:52.444
You know?
It's all wrong, son.

01:14:52.444 --> 01:14:55.534
Wow... it's good timing.

01:14:55.534 --> 01:14:56.927
I'm sorry.

01:14:57.971 --> 01:15:00.713
Sorry I haven't been more
of a step father for you.

01:15:03.107 --> 01:15:04.630
What do you mean?
You were good.

01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:07.111
No... Was I?

01:15:07.111 --> 01:15:09.374
Yeah, man. Sweet.

01:15:09.853 --> 01:15:11.681
All those piano lessons.
- Ah.

01:15:11.681 --> 01:15:13.552
You hated those.
- I did.

01:15:13.552 --> 01:15:15.467
But now I'm glad I had them.

01:15:17.425 --> 01:15:19.950
And... you taught me
how to fail.

01:15:20.951 --> 01:15:22.387
- Oh, great.
- I mean,

01:15:22.387 --> 01:15:24.607
I mean, you taught me perseverance.

01:15:24.607 --> 01:15:26.391
Oh, okay.

01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:28.393
I like that.

01:15:29.699 --> 01:15:31.744
I always felt like
some sort of silent partner

01:15:31.744 --> 01:15:33.703
when it came to you,

01:15:33.703 --> 01:15:35.356
compared to your mother.

01:15:35.356 --> 01:15:37.271
Silence can be pretty loud.

01:15:38.446 --> 01:15:40.971
Tthen we have lunch,
we go back to work.

01:15:40.971 --> 01:15:42.929
Got vespers at five o'clock,

01:15:43.234 --> 01:15:47.064
we have our dinner and--
- Please excuse me.

01:15:48.413 --> 01:15:49.545
Hey.

01:15:51.851 --> 01:15:53.070
How do you feel?

01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:57.901
I feel so much love
for everyone.

01:16:00.686 --> 01:16:02.296
It's wonderful.

01:16:04.777 --> 01:16:06.039
I know that...

01:16:07.606 --> 01:16:09.695
I know that my having
a nervous breakdown

01:16:09.695 --> 01:16:12.089
might make it seem like
I don't have a vocation.

01:16:12.089 --> 01:16:14.482
But once I get better,

01:16:14.482 --> 01:16:17.268
I-I'm sure I'll still want
to join the sisters.

01:16:18.138 --> 01:16:19.923
See how you feel in a year.

01:16:20.924 --> 01:16:23.491
[sighs]
- Okay.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:28.235
Oh, Magdalena,
thank you. Would you...

01:16:28.235 --> 01:16:30.673
Would you please sit down
for a moment?

01:16:30.673 --> 01:16:32.109
Thank you so much.

01:16:34.677 --> 01:16:38.245
Now...
[exhales]

01:16:38.245 --> 01:16:41.248
What is going to happen
with Julian?

01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:45.688
You meant it that you
would help any way at all?

01:16:45.688 --> 01:16:47.646
Yes. Yes.

01:16:47.646 --> 01:16:50.083
Me too. Whatever you need,
I will do it.

01:16:51.563 --> 01:16:52.608
Okay.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.436
We're allowed to get married
in Delaware,

01:16:55.436 --> 01:16:57.787
if one of Tereza's
parent signs in person.

01:16:59.919 --> 01:17:01.312
I will sign.

01:17:03.488 --> 01:17:05.751
I'm just sorry
I'm not going to be there.

01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:07.274
Mom.

01:17:08.841 --> 01:17:10.321
I'll drive you.

01:17:10.321 --> 01:17:11.627
Right now, all of you.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.106
I'll drive you right now.
- I'm...

01:17:13.106 --> 01:17:15.543
I am worried about driving
out of state with Tereza.

01:17:15.543 --> 01:17:17.023
- Why?
- Trey...

01:17:17.023 --> 01:17:20.897
he has become obsessed
with Julian, and the situation.

01:17:21.506 --> 01:17:24.248
I think he would do anything
to catch us.

01:17:24.248 --> 01:17:25.858
He has a lot of friends
in the police.

01:17:25.858 --> 01:17:27.468
And...

01:17:27.468 --> 01:17:29.470
I am not citizen yet.

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:34.606

01:17:34.606 --> 01:17:36.869
[seagulls squawking]

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.223
Is Katrina on board?

01:17:43.223 --> 01:17:44.442
[boat horn blares]

01:17:44.442 --> 01:17:46.662
She took the afternoon off.

01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:56.628
[indistinct chatter]

01:17:56.628 --> 01:17:59.152
- Can I talk to you for--
- Oh, you stalking me now?

01:17:59.152 --> 01:18:00.676
Can I talk to you
for a moment?

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:02.852
- Helmut.
- Helmut. Steven.

01:18:02.852 --> 01:18:04.549
Please, I just need
to talk to you in private.

01:18:04.549 --> 01:18:05.724
Just tell me what it is.

01:18:05.724 --> 01:18:07.552
Stay right there.
I'll be right back.

01:18:09.293 --> 01:18:10.686
What is it?

01:18:12.731 --> 01:18:14.385
Who is that guy?

01:18:14.385 --> 01:18:15.952
What difference does it make?

01:18:16.953 --> 01:18:18.606
Don't look at me like--
- Katrina,

01:18:18.606 --> 01:18:21.174
please, I wouldn't ask,
but it's about my son.

01:18:21.174 --> 01:18:24.700
I need your help.
He's in... He's in real danger.

01:18:26.266 --> 01:18:27.746
Time to get in the car,
young lady.

01:18:27.746 --> 01:18:29.574
No, it's fine, I'm gonna
go meet my friends

01:18:29.574 --> 01:18:31.837
on the subway anyway. No!
- Get in the car.

01:18:31.837 --> 01:18:33.143
Okay!

01:18:33.143 --> 01:18:34.492
[in foreign language]:
Tereza, get in the car!

01:18:34.492 --> 01:18:35.536
God...

01:18:38.757 --> 01:18:40.585
Welcome to the new regime.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.110
From here on in,
you get picked up from school,

01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:46.330
you get dropped off at school,
and everything in between,

01:18:46.330 --> 01:18:48.288
you're grounded.
You went off the deep end,

01:18:48.288 --> 01:18:50.029
Tereza, and I blame myself.

01:18:51.422 --> 01:18:53.598
Mom. What are you wearing?

01:18:55.252 --> 01:18:58.342
Oh my God, you guys have got
to be kidding me right now.

01:18:58.342 --> 01:19:00.910
You're about to have a whole
new kind of fun, young lady!

01:19:01.562 --> 01:19:03.260
This is a two day event.

01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:04.391
What?

01:19:04.391 --> 01:19:06.742
Today is the Incident
at Bushy Glen,

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.221
just a skirmish, really.

01:19:08.221 --> 01:19:09.832
They'll be setting up.

01:19:10.963 --> 01:19:12.573
Tomorrow is the big battle.

01:19:13.487 --> 01:19:15.315
Don't worry,
I brought your toothbrush.

01:19:17.491 --> 01:19:20.277
Nothing like living history
to teach you about discipline.

01:19:20.277 --> 01:19:22.540
But it's a lot more
than that, it's fun.

01:19:23.889 --> 01:19:25.848
I've never let either of you
in on this,

01:19:25.848 --> 01:19:28.676
I guess I've felt
kind of shy...

01:19:29.721 --> 01:19:31.854
but what you go for
in the hobby,

01:19:32.637 --> 01:19:34.770
the reason why
we're all so addictive to it

01:19:34.770 --> 01:19:37.642
is something called
a "period rush".

01:19:38.599 --> 01:19:40.253
It's the feeling of...

01:19:41.037 --> 01:19:42.995
actually going back in time.

01:19:46.042 --> 01:19:48.609
[Magdalena]: We'll stop on
the way so you can change.

01:20:00.665 --> 01:20:02.232
Cell phones in the lock box.

01:20:02.232 --> 01:20:03.799
I didn't bring mine.

01:20:04.843 --> 01:20:06.932
So you're a confederate now?

01:20:06.932 --> 01:20:09.326
Cody Herlbutt is retiring,

01:20:09.326 --> 01:20:11.937
and I have been asked
to personify Colonel Picket

01:20:11.937 --> 01:20:13.504
in his place.

01:20:13.504 --> 01:20:15.941
I don whichever uniform
is needed on the day.

01:20:16.376 --> 01:20:19.466
My commitment is to history.
This is not about ego here.

01:20:20.772 --> 01:20:23.601
[light fiddle music playing]

01:20:23.601 --> 01:20:25.690
[indistinct chatter]

01:20:27.866 --> 01:20:29.999
Colonel Picket!

01:20:29.999 --> 01:20:31.304
Colonel Desmond.

01:20:32.088 --> 01:20:33.698
Congratulations, Pard.

01:20:33.698 --> 01:20:35.569
The camp is ready
for your inspection.

01:20:35.569 --> 01:20:36.657
- Elodie.
- Colonel Picket.

01:20:36.657 --> 01:20:37.963
You recollect Elodie,

01:20:37.963 --> 01:20:39.747
she's going to take you
over to the mess tent.

01:20:39.747 --> 01:20:41.271
- Hello again.
- Great to see you.

01:20:41.271 --> 01:20:44.230
Off to your feet.
Prepare for inspection!

01:20:44.230 --> 01:20:45.971
- Looking good soldier.
- This is of course

01:20:45.971 --> 01:20:47.320
what the men have to do.

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:49.061
But you wouldn't believe
the wonderful time...

01:20:49.061 --> 01:20:50.410
- Boots.
- ...that we have here

01:20:50.410 --> 01:20:51.672
in the mess tent.

01:20:51.672 --> 01:20:52.804
Of course, your husband
is incredibly

01:20:52.804 --> 01:20:54.850
well respected, but on our own,

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.852
we have quite a party.
- Tent is a mess,

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:58.592
but I hear you play
a good fiddle.

01:20:58.592 --> 01:21:00.290
Hopefully, that'll
make up for it.

01:21:05.904 --> 01:21:07.427
Cup a noodles?!

01:21:07.427 --> 01:21:09.516
Really? Cup a noodles?!
- Really shameful.

01:21:09.516 --> 01:21:11.214
This is Colonel Picket's
family.

01:21:11.214 --> 01:21:13.303
It's their first time.

01:21:13.303 --> 01:21:14.391
She can help you.

01:21:14.391 --> 01:21:15.609
Oh, wonderful.

01:21:15.609 --> 01:21:17.960
If you're good
with vegetables...

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.876
Let's see what we have
planned for today.

01:21:21.572 --> 01:21:23.922
So, my skirmishers...

01:21:23.922 --> 01:21:27.447
are going to come down the road,
driving your forces

01:21:27.447 --> 01:21:30.146
until we capture the crossroads.
- Excellent.

01:21:30.146 --> 01:21:32.670
And then I will maneuver my men
and we will get ready to push

01:21:32.670 --> 01:21:34.541
you back here
to fish pond field.

01:21:34.541 --> 01:21:36.021
But I thought I...

01:21:36.021 --> 01:21:38.371
I thought the action
started at the crossroads.

01:21:38.371 --> 01:21:41.505
No. No. No, the O.R.
say that the action...

01:21:41.505 --> 01:21:42.941
Jodie brings the party

01:21:42.941 --> 01:21:44.769
for when the day
goes on a bit long

01:21:44.769 --> 01:21:47.598
if you'd like to there.
- Thank you. But can I try this?

01:21:47.598 --> 01:21:49.034
- Oh, yes.
- This is bread?

01:21:49.034 --> 01:21:51.341
Oh yes that's Mary Ann's
personal recipe.

01:21:51.341 --> 01:21:52.995
It is time period appropriate,

01:21:52.995 --> 01:21:55.388
it has molasses in there.
- Well...

01:21:55.388 --> 01:21:57.086
I actually took the liberty

01:21:57.086 --> 01:22:00.045
of starting the action
at the crossroads.

01:22:00.045 --> 01:22:01.394
Why would you do that?

01:22:01.394 --> 01:22:03.614
It's incredibly nourishing.

01:22:03.614 --> 01:22:06.182
There's some mutton
and rosemary in there.

01:22:06.182 --> 01:22:07.618
You need more firewood.

01:22:07.618 --> 01:22:09.489
- Oh.
- Can I bring you more?

01:22:09.489 --> 01:22:10.926
That would be wonderful,
thank you.

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:13.537
We've got firewood over there.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:22:13.537 --> 01:22:14.930
Yeah. Thank you.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.148
Tereza...

01:22:16.148 --> 01:22:18.020
[in foreign language]:
Tereza, come with me...

01:22:23.721 --> 01:22:25.288
Fire wood!
- Let's not fight two wars here.

01:22:25.288 --> 01:22:28.291
We are here for the tindall
preservation of it all.

01:22:28.291 --> 01:22:29.988
We are going
to follow the plan.

01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:31.250
Something that I've worked
hand in glove

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:33.470
with the Bushy Glen Foundation.

01:22:44.133 --> 01:22:46.222
Mom, what is going on?

01:22:47.658 --> 01:22:50.878
If I have to choose between
you and him, I choose you.

01:22:55.666 --> 01:22:58.538
There you are.
Let's go. C'mon.

[seagulls squawking]

01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:13.031
Des, throw the lines off.

01:23:13.031 --> 01:23:14.424
Stow them away.

01:23:14.424 --> 01:23:15.773
Yes, cap.

01:23:16.078 --> 01:23:17.949

Yes, both of them.

I don't know
what kind of vehicle,

01:23:26.392 --> 01:23:27.959
he must have picked them up.

01:23:27.959 --> 01:23:29.743
John, you need
to put out a roadblock!

01:23:29.743 --> 01:23:31.963
This is my daughter
we're talking about here.

01:23:40.189 --> 01:23:42.017

- Thank you.

Okay. Kids and Magdalena,

01:23:47.239 --> 01:23:49.328
you are straight ahead.
- Hi, honey, here's a towel.

You're bunk is straight ahead.
Julian already

01:23:51.026 --> 01:23:53.245

- Thank you.

01:23:53.245 --> 01:23:54.681
- How are you?
- There you go.

01:23:54.681 --> 01:23:56.248
Good to see ya.

01:23:56.248 --> 01:23:57.858
Uh, you're upstairs with Des.

01:23:57.858 --> 01:23:59.382
Great. Thank you.

her right out.

she's that fragile?

good person.

her be hurt
