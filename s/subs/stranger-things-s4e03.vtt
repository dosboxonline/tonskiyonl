[faucet running]

00:17.058 --> 00:21.271
[faint rumbling]

00:21.354 --> 00:23.356
[dishware rattling]

00:25.900 --> 00:27.068
[ominous rumbling building]

00:27.152 --> 00:28.695
[pots and pans clanging]

00:28.778 --> 00:30.947
-[helicopter blades whirring]
-[woman gasps]

00:31.031 --> 00:32.323
[dramatic music playing]

00:33.533 --> 00:34.534
[woman grunts]

00:39.205 --> 00:40.206
Sam.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.104
[blades slowing]

01:08.735 --> 01:11.071
[dramatic musical flourish]

01:12.989 --> 01:16.201
[Sullivan] There were no signs
of any attacker. No bruises.

01:16.284 --> 01:17.994
No signs of any struggle.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.914
It's as if her attacker was a ghost.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.084
Does this remind you of anything, Doctor?

01:24.751 --> 01:26.503
No, it doesn't.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.463
Are you sure?

01:29.672 --> 01:31.007
Why are you here?

01:31.549 --> 01:32.425
Really.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.635
I'd like your opinion.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.845
I was fired, in case you forgot.

01:35.929 --> 01:40.016
A foreign government invaded our country,
all under your watch.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.353
There had to be consequences.
Certainly you understand that.

01:43.436 --> 01:47.065
What I understand is that something…
something is going on in that town

01:47.148 --> 01:50.902
that nobody… nobody fully comprehends.

01:50.985 --> 01:54.614
And I also understand
that military strength is not the answer.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.491
So what is the answer, Doctor?

01:57.075 --> 01:58.201
More scientists?

01:58.284 --> 02:00.912
Because it was
men of science, men like you,

02:00.995 --> 02:02.664
who created this problem
in the first place.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.707
[tense music playing]

02:05.667 --> 02:07.335
Everything that has happened in Hawkins

02:07.418 --> 02:09.420
can be traced back
to Brenner's little pet.

02:10.004 --> 02:10.922
Wouldn't you agree?

02:14.968 --> 02:16.219
[tense music intensifies]

02:16.302 --> 02:17.929
[energy thrumming]

02:18.680 --> 02:19.514
[bones snapping]

02:19.597 --> 02:21.766
[tense music continues]

02:21.850 --> 02:24.185
Dr. Brenner trained her
for this very thing.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.729
Remote assassinations.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.525
What you're suggesting is impossible.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.193
-Is it?
-Eleven is dead.

02:32.277 --> 02:35.196
-I'm not convinced.
-So, where has she been all this time?

02:35.280 --> 02:36.781
There are rumors she's alive

02:36.865 --> 02:39.409
and receiving help
from someone on the inside.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.495
Are you saying I'm helping her?
Is that what you're saying?

02:42.579 --> 02:45.874
If I wanted to chat, Doctor,
I would've picked up the damn phone.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.170
Now, you can make this easy
and tell us where she is, or…

02:51.546 --> 02:53.840
we can do this the hard way.

02:58.469 --> 03:00.930
-[door clattering]
-[soldier 1] Not in here. Go! Go! Go!

03:02.098 --> 03:03.641
-[soldier 2] Move!
-[soldier 1] Nothing.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.769
[soldiers speaking indistinctly]

03:08.563 --> 03:10.148
[woman] Why are you taking that box?

03:10.231 --> 03:12.483
Those are Peter's old school projects.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.569
You do not need those. Hey!

03:14.652 --> 03:16.112
I'm talking to you!

03:16.696 --> 03:18.364
Sam, do something.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.995
[tense music building]

03:24.078 --> 03:26.080
[helicopter whirring]

03:36.716 --> 03:38.426
[Sullivan] I wanna know
everything he's done,

03:38.509 --> 03:40.094
everyone he's spoken to in the past year.

03:40.178 --> 03:41.346
And if we're lucky,

03:42.555 --> 03:44.015
he'll lead us right to the girl.

03:49.020 --> 03:51.022
[tense music swells, fades]

03:52.398 --> 03:54.400
[theme music playing]

04:54.377 --> 04:56.170
[siren wailing in distance]

04:56.254 --> 04:58.089
[eerie, unsettling music playing]

04:58.172 --> 05:00.425
-[Angela shudders]
-[EMT] Can you tell me your name?

05:00.508 --> 05:03.011
-Um, Angela.
-Angela.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.054
Do you know where you are, Angela?

05:05.138 --> 05:08.433
-Um, Rink… Rink-O-Mania, I think?
-Rink-O-Mania. Very good.

05:08.516 --> 05:11.394
-Now, where does it hurt, sweetie?
-My head.

05:11.477 --> 05:12.603
[EMT] Your head hurts?

05:12.687 --> 05:15.148
And my nose. [Angela whimpering, crying]

05:15.231 --> 05:18.609
-[eerie, unsettling music continues]
-[Angela] I can't breathe.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.778
[EMT] Just try to take some deep breaths.

05:20.862 --> 05:24.032
Breathe slow for me, okay? That's it.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.951
I know it's a lot of blood,
but you're going to be okay.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.536
-[Angela] I don't think so.
-I promise.

05:28.619 --> 05:31.456
Just need you to answer
a few more questions, all right?

05:31.539 --> 05:33.833
-[unsettling music intensifies]
-[Angela] Okay.

05:33.916 --> 05:35.918
[faint pulsing]

05:38.880 --> 05:39.881
[Angela] No.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.052
[Angela] I don't know.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.970
[pulsing continues]

05:46.054 --> 05:48.890
[Argyle] I know
this may be, like, upsetting and shit,

05:48.973 --> 05:51.976
but that future prom queen
is gonna be fine.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.978
It's just, like, rubber wheels.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.730
-[Jonathan] Plastic.
-[Argyle] Oh.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.607
Not like hard plastic. Just…

05:58.900 --> 06:01.152
-Just the soft kind.
-Totally.

06:01.235 --> 06:04.197
But you ever wonder
why the wheels aren't wood, man?

06:04.781 --> 06:05.615
Or metal?

06:06.157 --> 06:09.535
So people don't get hurt
when they get shmacked.

06:09.619 --> 06:10.703
-Oh.
-Yeah.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.498
Because it happens
more than you think, man.

06:13.581 --> 06:14.874
Roller-skate attacks.

06:14.957 --> 06:18.002
Man. Hey, at least it wasn't an ice skate.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.880
That nose would've been
sliced clean off, man.

06:20.963 --> 06:22.298
[exclaims]

06:22.382 --> 06:25.802
-It could've been so much worse.
-So much worse.

06:26.302 --> 06:29.972
In the grand scheme of things,
it's just a little blip.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.599
That's a funny word, man.

06:31.682 --> 06:32.517
"Blip."

06:33.017 --> 06:34.477
-"Blip."
-"Blip."

06:34.560 --> 06:39.148
[both, in time to jaunty music]
Blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip, blip.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.113
[Jonathan and Argyle continue]

06:45.196 --> 06:47.198
[grandiose opera music playing faintly]

06:52.412 --> 06:54.414
[opera music intensifies]

06:59.335 --> 07:00.336
-Mom?
-[door closes]

07:03.297 --> 07:07.343
[yells] Well, well! Aren't you lot
a sight for sore eyes, huh?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.595
-Hi, Murray.
-You kids like risotto?

07:10.430 --> 07:11.389
[laughs] Yeah.

07:13.474 --> 07:16.978
[Murray] There I was, headed down the I-5,
going to see a client in Ventura.

07:17.061 --> 07:19.313
I'm looking for a motel
to stay for the night,

07:19.397 --> 07:22.150
and suddenly, bam, it hits me.

07:22.233 --> 07:24.485
"Didn't the Byers move here?"

07:24.569 --> 07:26.737
Small world, isn't it? It's a small world.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.865
[Murray] So I thought,
"Hey, you know what?"

07:28.948 --> 07:31.534
"Why don't I drop in,
say hello to my old friends?" [chuckles]

07:31.617 --> 07:32.952
It's so sweet of you.

07:33.035 --> 07:35.830
-Sweeter of you to let me stay. [chuckles]
-[Joyce] And he cooks.

07:35.913 --> 07:39.041
Mm, and cleans.
A regular little housewife.

07:39.125 --> 07:40.460
[Joyce] You should stay.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.713
I'd be tempted, Joyce,
except, you know, you have that, uh…

07:44.297 --> 07:46.132
Right, that business trip.

07:46.215 --> 07:47.925
Business trip? What business trip?

07:48.009 --> 07:50.887
Oh my gosh. [chuckles]
I almost forgot to tell you guys.

07:51.554 --> 07:54.265
-This thing came up at work…
-Can you pass me the olive oil?

07:54.348 --> 07:55.349
That's wine.

07:55.433 --> 07:59.270
And it turns out I have to go
to a conference tomorrow. In Alaska.

07:59.353 --> 08:00.396
-Alaska?
-Tomorrow?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.522
Crazy, right? [chuckles]

08:01.606 --> 08:04.984
That's where they're based,
the Britannicas.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.737
Joan and Brian Britannica.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.530
[Murray sighs] Mm.

08:10.364 --> 08:12.575
So do Eskimos, like,
still live in igloos,

08:12.658 --> 08:17.580
or, uh, are they, like, fully-blown,
like, living in the… in the suburbs now?

08:18.331 --> 08:19.207
Who is this?

08:19.290 --> 08:20.917
So, Jonathan,

08:21.000 --> 08:25.046
this means you're gonna have to,
you know, take charge while I'm gone.

08:25.630 --> 08:26.714
-[Murray] Yeah.
-Wait.

08:27.632 --> 08:28.466
What?

08:29.342 --> 08:30.176
What's going on?

08:30.760 --> 08:32.386
-Oh my…
-Your mom's going to Alaska.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.846
You're going to Alaska?

08:33.930 --> 08:34.972
[Argyle] Mm-hmm.

08:35.056 --> 08:37.767
-What's going on in Alaska?
-The Britannicas are there.

08:37.850 --> 08:39.185
-The Britannicas?
-Mm-hmm.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.270
Jonathan, what is wrong with you?

08:41.354 --> 08:45.233
-I think I know what's wrong with him.
-We just had a super stressful day.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.192
Stress, huh?

08:46.275 --> 08:49.028
This girl got shmacked
in the head today at the roller rink.

08:49.111 --> 08:52.114
-Shmacked?
-Yeah, one of those vicious skate attacks.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.201
-A skate attack?
-Yeah, but it wasn't an ice skate. It was…

08:56.035 --> 08:59.163
-[Jonathan] It was a plastic skate.
-No, it was, like, rubber.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.206
Rubber. Rubber.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.667
-Rubber.
-[Argyle] You know what? I'm not sure.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.836
Anyway, she looked like
she's gonna be fine.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.297
-She's totally fine.
-She didn't look fine.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.555
[Joyce] El, aren't you gonna finish your--

09:15.638 --> 09:16.639
What…?

09:17.515 --> 09:18.516
[footsteps receding]

09:19.850 --> 09:22.270
-[Will sighs]
-What is going on, you guys?

09:22.353 --> 09:25.523
Okay, I, uh, I sense tension. [chuckles]

09:26.566 --> 09:28.442
Is it the risotto?
Everyone hates the risotto?

09:28.526 --> 09:30.528
-Absolutely not. No, it's incredible.
-Mm-mm.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.864
This risotto is shmackin', dude.

09:33.948 --> 09:34.782
[chuckles]

09:34.865 --> 09:36.701
Still have no idea who he is.

09:48.963 --> 09:50.590
[delicate, somber music playing]

09:53.509 --> 09:54.760
[Mike, echoing] What did you do?

09:54.844 --> 09:55.886
What did you do?

09:57.638 --> 09:59.765
-[Eleven, echoing] Angela!
-[Angela screaming]

10:00.850 --> 10:02.268
[eerie audio distortion]

10:02.351 --> 10:03.728
What have you done?

10:06.022 --> 10:07.732
[echoing] What have you done?

10:07.815 --> 10:11.861
[eerie audio distortion]

10:11.944 --> 10:13.946
[sinister music playing]

[distant clattering]

11:25.309 --> 11:28.813
[indistinct chatter continues]

11:28.896 --> 11:30.773
[boy 1] He sees all this? He sees us?

11:30.856 --> 11:33.651
He'll shit his pants and cry for Mommy.
This guy's no fighter.

11:33.734 --> 11:36.237
[boy 2] Hope he tries something.
Gives me a reason.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.530
[boy 3] Hell, yeah.

11:37.613 --> 11:39.949
Well, well, look who's decided to join.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.617
What are you guys doing?

11:42.201 --> 11:44.745
-We're gearing up.
-Preparing for the hunt.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.330
[menacing music playing]

11:46.414 --> 11:47.790
[wrench and bat clang]

11:47.873 --> 11:49.917
Hey, man. Relax.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.586
We're not killers like Eddie.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.213
We just wanna talk to him.

11:54.296 --> 11:55.673
Get him to admit his crime.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.883
Yeah, a little friendly neighborhood chat.

12:00.886 --> 12:01.762
Hey.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.098
You didn't know Chris.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.436
If you're not up to this, you can go home.
There's no judgment.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.730
You'll still be one of us, all right?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.026
No.

12:16.861 --> 12:17.695
I'm good.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.616
I wanna help.

12:24.160 --> 12:24.994
All right.

12:27.496 --> 12:28.706
Let's capture us a freak.

12:28.789 --> 12:30.624
[menacing music swells, fades]

12:35.838 --> 12:37.214
[Eddie panting]

12:37.298 --> 12:38.966
[floorboards creaking]

12:39.049 --> 12:39.925
[whispering] Shit.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.719
Oh shit.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.180
-[loud bang]
-Jesus…

12:44.263 --> 12:45.473
[eerie musical flourish]

12:45.556 --> 12:46.766
Delivery service.

12:46.849 --> 12:47.850
[exhales]

12:52.062 --> 12:55.566
So we got, uh, some good news
and some bad news.

12:56.650 --> 12:59.612
-How do you prefer it?
-Bad news first, always.

12:59.695 --> 13:00.821
[Dustin] All right. Bad news.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.407
We tapped into the Hawkins PD dispatch
with our Cerebro,

13:03.491 --> 13:05.576
and they're definitely looking for you.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.953
Also, they're, uh, pretty convinced
you killed Chrissy.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.915
Like, 100% kind of convinced.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.542
-And the good news?
-[Robin] Your name hasn't gone public yet.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.420
But if we found out about you,
it's a matter of time before others do.

13:16.504 --> 13:19.799
And once that gets out,
everyone and their shallow-minded mother

13:19.882 --> 13:21.175
is gonna be gunning for you.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.135
Hunt the freak, right?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.512
-Exactly.
-Shit.

13:24.595 --> 13:25.888
So, before that happens,

13:25.971 --> 13:28.599
we find Vecna, kill him,
and prove your innocence.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.559
That's all, Dustin? That's all?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.311
Yeah, no, that's pretty much it.

13:32.394 --> 13:33.646
[Robin] Listen, Eddie,

13:33.729 --> 13:36.732
I know everything Dustin is saying
sounds totally delusional,

13:36.816 --> 13:39.026
but we've actually
been through this before.

13:39.109 --> 13:41.654
I mean, they have a… a few times,

13:41.737 --> 13:43.489
and… and I have once.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.784
Mine was more human-flesh-based,
theirs was more smoke-related,

13:46.867 --> 13:49.703
but bottom line is,
collectively, I really feel we got this.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.289
We usually rely on this girl
who has super powers.

13:52.373 --> 13:57.044
-But, uh, those went bye-bye, so…
-So we're technically in more of the--

13:57.127 --> 13:58.629
-Kinda…
-Brainstorming phase.

13:58.712 --> 13:59.672
Brainstorming.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.758
[Dustin splutters]
There… There's nothing to worry about.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.843
[scoffs]

14:07.930 --> 14:09.014
[sirens wailing]

14:09.098 --> 14:10.641
-[whispers] Shit.
-Tarp.

14:10.724 --> 14:11.851
Tarp. Tarp.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.895
[sirens increasing in volume]

14:22.611 --> 14:24.613
[camera shutter clicks, echoes]

14:28.826 --> 14:30.828
[indistinct radio chatter]

14:37.084 --> 14:39.378
[officer] And after you talked to Wayne,
what happened?

14:39.920 --> 14:41.589
I heard barking from the dog,

14:41.672 --> 14:44.008
and then… he was just gone.

14:44.800 --> 14:48.053
See anyone lurking about?
Who looks like they shouldn't be there?

14:48.137 --> 14:51.140
No. No, no, there was nobody there.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.767
-"Nobody."
-I already told this to Officer Daniels.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.520
Did you look into Victor Creel?

14:56.604 --> 14:58.480
-Sorry, what's that?
-[Daniels] Victor Creel.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.150
Wayne got it in her head
that the old nut did this.

15:01.233 --> 15:05.195
[clicks tongue] Victor's locked away.
Don't need to worry about him, all right?

15:05.821 --> 15:08.866
Now, you said last you saw Fred,

15:08.949 --> 15:10.367
he was by the picnic tables.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.120
-Do I have that right?
-[car approaching]

15:13.787 --> 15:14.622
Ms. Wheeler.

15:14.705 --> 15:15.873
[resolute synth music playing]

15:15.956 --> 15:18.042
He was by the picnic tables.
Is that correct?

15:19.293 --> 15:20.377
Ms. Wheeler?

15:22.630 --> 15:24.632
Does the picnic table ring a bell?

15:30.971 --> 15:32.473
[skater] Whoo!

15:32.556 --> 15:34.850
[skaters chattering indistinctly]

15:48.781 --> 15:52.701
Hey, guys, there is a 4:00 p.m. showing
of Police Academy 3.

15:53.786 --> 15:54.828
Could be fun.

15:54.912 --> 15:57.122
Maybe we just stay home today.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.250
What is this?
You guys just gonna mope around all break?

16:00.334 --> 16:03.420
No one's moping.
It's just the movie is supposed to suck.

16:04.588 --> 16:05.714
It… [sighs]

16:21.355 --> 16:23.357
[knocks] Hey, El.

16:23.440 --> 16:26.151
I, uh, made you some Eggos,
but they're getting kinda cold.

16:34.243 --> 16:36.537
Hey, that's cool. Hop's cabin, right?

16:41.625 --> 16:42.626
[sighs]

16:44.878 --> 16:47.631
So, um, are we just
not gonna talk about it?

16:48.757 --> 16:50.175
[Eleven, flatly] About what?

16:50.259 --> 16:54.054
I don't know, just maybe,
like, about yesterday or…

16:54.680 --> 16:55.681
everything.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.225
[Eleven] There's nothing to say.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.352
Yeah, I guess, um…

17:01.270 --> 17:02.813
I guess I'm just a little, uh…

17:03.689 --> 17:05.315
Guess I don't really understand.

17:05.899 --> 17:08.027
Why didn't you tell me
what's going on here?

17:08.110 --> 17:12.614
I mean, you know I'm not exactly
Mr. Popularity back at home.

17:12.698 --> 17:17.119
I mean, you've seen it.
I've been bullied my entire life.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.079
I mean, I… I know what it's like.

17:19.955 --> 17:20.831
No.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.541
You don't.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.460
Okay.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.128
What don't I understand?

17:29.965 --> 17:31.175
I am different.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.260
[emotional music playing]

17:34.887 --> 17:36.305
I do not belong.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.099
You mean in Lenora?

17:44.021 --> 17:45.856
-Anywhere.
-[sighs]

17:46.440 --> 17:48.942
Come on,
you… you can't actually believe that.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.528
Everyone looks at me like…

17:52.654 --> 17:53.989
like I'm a monster.

17:54.573 --> 17:55.908
They just don't know you.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.327
You think I'm a monster too.

17:58.994 --> 17:59.828
What?

18:00.621 --> 18:01.747
Yesterday.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.166
The way you looked at me.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.085
You… You were scared of me.

18:06.168 --> 18:09.546
No. No. [scoffs]
No, that's not… That's… That's not true.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.964
I was surprised.

18:11.048 --> 18:14.009
Maybe I was a little upset in the moment,
but, I mean…

18:14.093 --> 18:16.428
I'm sorry. I just…
I didn't know what to do.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.056
I mean, it just was so crazy.
It happened so fast.

18:19.139 --> 18:21.725
But it doesn't change anything.
It doesn't matter.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.602
I… I care for you…

18:24.603 --> 18:25.729
so much.

18:26.897 --> 18:27.773
"Care."

18:30.776 --> 18:32.903
But you don't… you don't love me anymore?

18:32.986 --> 18:35.447
What… Who… Who said that I didn't?

18:35.531 --> 18:36.990
You never say it.

18:37.658 --> 18:38.784
I say it.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.371
You can't even write it, Mike.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.087
"From Mike." "From Mike." "From Mike."

18:50.170 --> 18:51.463
"From Mike." "From."

18:51.547 --> 18:53.924
Okay, okay.
Eleven, you're being ridiculous.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.759
What, like… What is this?

18:55.843 --> 18:57.386
You know what I think of you.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.597
You're the most incredible person
in the world.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.351
And you can't let
these mouth breathers ruin you. Ruin us.

19:04.434 --> 19:05.978
I mean, they're nobodies.

19:06.478 --> 19:07.896
They're nobodies.

19:09.189 --> 19:10.566
And you're a superhero.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.651
[emotional music continues]

19:15.195 --> 19:16.280
Not anymore.

19:16.363 --> 19:20.033
[emotional music swells]

19:20.117 --> 19:21.827
[TV playing faintly]

19:21.910 --> 19:22.911
[doorbell rings]

19:24.163 --> 19:25.998
Ten bucks says Mom forgot something.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.499
[chuckles] Yeah.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.960
I'm not taking that bet.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.422
Hi, does Jane Hopper live here?

19:33.505 --> 19:36.049
Uh, yeah. Um, what is this about?

19:36.133 --> 19:38.093
Is Jane's father or mother around?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.345
Uh, no. No, her mom's out of town.

19:40.429 --> 19:43.015
I'm her brother. Um, stepbrother. But, uh…

19:43.098 --> 19:45.350
I'm sorry, what… uh, what is this about?

19:45.434 --> 19:49.521
You may or may not be aware of an incident
involving Jane at the Rink-O-Mania.

19:49.605 --> 19:50.981
That was an accident.

19:51.064 --> 19:53.442
-[officer] A warrant says otherwise.
-[Jonathan] A warrant?

19:53.525 --> 19:55.861
Come on, that's crazy.
That doesn't need to happen.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.988
-Hey there.
-[tense music playing]

19:58.071 --> 19:59.156
You Jane Hopper?

20:00.949 --> 20:03.619
[tense music swells]

20:05.996 --> 20:07.831
[echoing]
You have the right to remain silent.

20:07.915 --> 20:11.710
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

20:12.836 --> 20:15.047
You have the right to an attorney.

20:15.130 --> 20:18.675
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be provided for you.

20:18.759 --> 20:21.094
[dramatic music playing]

20:21.178 --> 20:23.388
[Jonathan] Can you please tell us
where you're taking her?

20:23.472 --> 20:25.390
[Mike] Are the cuffs really necessary?

20:26.767 --> 20:28.060
Officers, answer me.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.607
Eleven. Eleven, listen to me. Okay?

20:33.690 --> 20:35.692
Eleven, will you please look at me?

20:36.401 --> 20:37.653
Everything's gonna be fine.

20:37.736 --> 20:39.529
I am going to fix this. Okay?

20:39.613 --> 20:42.991
Just… Just stay calm
and everything's gonna be fine. Okay?

20:43.075 --> 20:45.953
-[siren wails]
-Just… All you have to do is trust me.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.288
I promise.
I'm gonna get you out. I promise!

20:51.667 --> 20:53.168
[panting]

20:54.378 --> 20:56.338
-Has Mom's flight left yet?
-[whispers] Shit.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.590
[plane engine whooshing]

20:59.466 --> 21:00.884
[woman on PA] Ladies and gentlemen,

21:00.968 --> 21:03.553
the captain has turned on
the fasten seat belt sign.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.390
Please make sure your seat belts
are securely fastened.

21:06.473 --> 21:09.810
[inhales, exhales sharply]
Do you think I should've just told them?

21:14.398 --> 21:15.440
What? Told who?

21:15.524 --> 21:16.817
The kids.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.318
About Hopper.

21:18.402 --> 21:22.030
It… It just felt so wrong
to lie to them like that.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.074
Mm. Right, right, right.

21:24.157 --> 21:25.909
Well… [inhales]

21:25.993 --> 21:28.036
…I'm not exactly an expert in parenting.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.538
[chuckles]

21:29.621 --> 21:33.583
But, for what little it's worth,
I think you did the right thing.

21:33.667 --> 21:34.918
The responsible thing.

21:35.002 --> 21:36.420
Responsible.

21:37.004 --> 21:40.549
Your children,
bless their mischievous souls… [chuckles]

21:40.632 --> 21:41.967
…they like to get involved.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.762
This way, what?
They play too much Nintendo,

21:45.846 --> 21:47.931
eat too much junk food, smoke some ganja,

21:48.015 --> 21:49.266
pound some beers,

21:49.349 --> 21:50.976
experiment sexually.

21:51.059 --> 21:54.438
-What's the worst that can happen?
-[plane PA beeps]

21:54.521 --> 21:55.439
Excuse me, ma'am?

21:55.522 --> 21:58.483
Sorry to interrupt, but you're gonna
need to fasten your seat belt.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.653
[chuckling] Of course. Mm.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.196
Buckle up.

22:04.531 --> 22:07.701
Like this is really gonna save me
if we crash.

22:07.784 --> 22:09.786
[dramatic music playing]

22:37.397 --> 22:41.651
[indistinct chatter]

22:50.535 --> 22:52.704
[metal clanging]

23:08.178 --> 23:10.972
[heavy breathing]

23:16.144 --> 23:17.729
[in Russian] What is this, American?

23:18.230 --> 23:20.816
What is taking you this long?
Are you tired today?

23:21.608 --> 23:22.901
Pig.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.070
What do you say?

23:25.153 --> 23:26.488
Asshole!

23:28.657 --> 23:29.950
[Hopper grunting]

23:32.577 --> 23:33.537
[grunts]

23:34.204 --> 23:35.247
[pants]

23:35.330 --> 23:37.249
[in English]
Your Russian is getting better.

23:37.332 --> 23:38.333
So is your acting.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.835
All right. Come on, what is it?

23:41.086 --> 23:42.546
I bring news from America.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.297
I heard from your friends.

23:44.381 --> 23:46.675
They're bringing your money to Alaska.

23:47.342 --> 23:48.218
When?

23:48.301 --> 23:49.386
Today, I hope.

23:49.469 --> 23:53.140
If my pilot gets the money,
he will bring it in his plane tomorrow.

23:53.723 --> 23:56.143
Then you can hitch a ride
back to your country.

23:56.226 --> 23:57.394
I get rich,

23:58.145 --> 23:59.688
and you're a free man.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.899
-Sound too good to be true, yes?
-It does.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.944
This pilot, you sure you can trust him?

24:07.446 --> 24:09.739
His name is Yuri Ismaylov.
He's a smuggler.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.367
Supplies American goods
to some of us guards here,

24:12.451 --> 24:14.453
including me on lucky occasions.

24:14.536 --> 24:16.746
Cigarettes, peanut butter, Playboys,

24:17.372 --> 24:19.082
the best America has to offer.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.084
-Great. So he's a criminal.
-Of course.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.503
Who else do you want
to do this job? Gandhi?

24:23.587 --> 24:25.839
[Enzo chuckling]

24:25.922 --> 24:28.675
[sighs] You're worried
about your woman, is that it?

24:29.384 --> 24:31.511
I can see why you like her, American.

24:32.512 --> 24:33.722
When I talked to her,

24:34.306 --> 24:36.766
I can tell by voice
that she's very pretty.

24:36.850 --> 24:39.769
-Feisty too. I like that.
-[menacing music playing]

24:40.437 --> 24:41.855
Shame we won't meet.

24:41.938 --> 24:45.609
You promised me that she would be safe.

24:45.692 --> 24:46.902
And she will be.

24:47.652 --> 24:48.904
Let me handle Yuri.

24:48.987 --> 24:51.364
You have more important things
to worry about.

24:51.448 --> 24:54.493
Remember, you miss that plane tomorrow,

24:54.576 --> 24:56.411
I am still rich,

24:56.495 --> 24:58.705
and you're still stuck in Kamchatka.

24:58.788 --> 25:01.041
So whatever it is
you're planning, American,

25:01.124 --> 25:02.709
best get to it, yes?

25:04.294 --> 25:05.378
[in Russian] Antonov!

25:06.588 --> 25:09.341
Finish with your American toy,
we need him on the tracks.

25:30.195 --> 25:33.573
[Nancy] You're saying that this thing
that killed Fred and Chrissy,

25:33.657 --> 25:35.992
-it's from the Upside Down?
-If the shoe fits.

25:36.076 --> 25:39.162
Our working theory
is that he attacks with a spell

25:39.246 --> 25:41.122
or a curse.

25:41.748 --> 25:44.084
Now, whether or not he's doing
the bidding of the Mind Flayer

25:44.167 --> 25:46.670
or just loves killing teens,
we don't know.

25:46.753 --> 25:49.047
All we know is
this is something different.

25:49.130 --> 25:51.007
-Something new.
-Doesn't make sense.

25:51.091 --> 25:52.175
It's only a theory.

25:52.259 --> 25:55.053
No, Fred and Chrissy don't make sense.

25:55.136 --> 25:57.264
-I mean, why them?
-[uneasy music playing]

25:57.347 --> 25:58.974
Maybe they were just in the wrong place.

25:59.057 --> 26:01.309
-Were both at the game.
-And near the trailer park.

26:01.393 --> 26:02.811
We're at the trailer park.

26:03.395 --> 26:06.523
Uh, should we maybe not be here?

26:08.316 --> 26:10.277
There is something about this place.

26:11.111 --> 26:13.196
Fred started acting weird
the second we got here.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.448
[Robin] Acting weird as in…?

26:16.241 --> 26:17.158
Scared,

26:18.076 --> 26:19.119
on edge,

26:19.202 --> 26:20.287

26:20.370 --> 26:21.955
Max said Chrissy was upset too.

26:22.038 --> 26:23.373
Yeah, but not here.

26:23.456 --> 26:25.792
She was crying in the bathroom at school.

26:27.210 --> 26:31.548
Serial killers stalk their prey
before they strike, right?

26:31.631 --> 26:34.801
So, maybe Fred and Chrissy
saw this Vecman--

26:34.884 --> 26:36.094
-Vecna.
-Dunno about you,

26:36.177 --> 26:39.180
but if I saw some freaky wizard monster,

26:39.264 --> 26:41.516
I would mention it to someone.

26:41.600 --> 26:42.517
Maybe they did.

26:44.227 --> 26:46.354
I saw Chrissy leaving Ms. Kelley's office.

26:47.314 --> 26:50.900
If you saw a monster, you… you wouldn't go
to the police. They'd never believe you.

I don't wanna waste your time.
It's a real shot in the dark.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.091
Yeah, okay. Are you out of your mind?

27:15.175 --> 27:16.926
Flying solo with Vecna on the loose?

27:17.010 --> 27:19.763
No, it's too dangerous.
You need… You need someone to…

27:21.890 --> 27:23.725
Here. I'll stick with Nance.

27:23.808 --> 27:25.185
Take the car, check out the shrink.

-Why?

-I don't have a license.
-Why?

thinks that Victor Creel
escaped from Pennhurst Asylum

and that he's the one running around
committing these murders?

36:35.193 --> 36:36.319
Pretty much.

But Victor committed the eyeball murders,
like, way back in the '50s.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.284
Well, '59.

predate Eleven in the Upside Down

36:59.383 --> 37:02.220

and lift people into the air.

37:02.303 --> 37:04.680
It doesn't make sense. I know.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.933
That's why I said
it was a shot in the dark.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.268
I know. I just thought
that by "shot in the dark,"

37:09.352 --> 37:12.521
you were being modest or hiding
something super solid up your sleeve

37:12.605 --> 37:14.232
that you were gonna wow us with later.

37:14.315 --> 37:17.235
But this is

37:27.745 --> 37:30.122
Could we get the keys
to the basement archives?

37:30.206 --> 37:31.791
Of course. Give me one sec.

37:33.292 --> 37:35.378
Did I come off mean or condescending?

-No.
-Right.

37:38.339 --> 37:41.592
Sorry. It's just, you seem annoyed.

37:41.676 --> 37:42.885
You don't know me well.

37:42.969 --> 37:46.055
I don't really have a filter
or a strong grasp of social cues.

37:46.138 --> 37:47.848
-Okay.
-If I say something that upsets you,

37:47.932 --> 37:51.769
just know that I know it's a flaw.
Believe me, my mother reminds me daily.

37:51.852 --> 37:53.354
-Got it.
-All right, ladies.

37:53.437 --> 37:55.940
Here you go. Have fun.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.900
Yep. We'll try.

38:09.203 --> 38:11.747
Hi. I'm so sorry
to bother you over break,

38:11.831 --> 38:14.166
but… do you have a minute to talk?

38:14.750 --> 38:18.129
Um, yeah, of course. Of course.

38:21.716 --> 38:23.634
Okay. She's in.

38:24.218 --> 38:26.137
I'm missing collarbones, not eyes.

38:28.597 --> 38:29.682
So,

38:30.933 --> 38:32.935
we gonna talk about… it?

38:33.728 --> 38:36.188
Huh? Sorry, talk about what?

38:36.939 --> 38:39.483
Your temporary insanity earlier today

38:39.567 --> 38:41.986
when you basically
threw yourself at Nance?

38:42.653 --> 38:45.489
-That's not what happened.
-Pretty sure that's what happened.

38:45.573 --> 38:47.867
It was public.
There were a lot of witnesses.

38:47.950 --> 38:50.036
You implying I still
have a thing for Nance?

38:50.119 --> 38:51.203
No. I'm not implying.

38:51.287 --> 38:55.958
I'm stating. And, as it relates
to your steadfast refusal to date Robin,

38:56.042 --> 38:58.169
it's pretty much
the only logical explanation.

38:58.252 --> 38:59.920
That's not the only one.

39:00.004 --> 39:01.547
And as for Nance,

39:02.298 --> 39:04.592
I was just trying to protect a friend.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.553
-A friend, Henderson. Okay?
-Okay.

39:07.636 --> 39:10.264
Don't wanna find her
with her eyes sucked out of her skull

in the face right now.

39:14.018 --> 39:15.686
I'm not. I don't wanna talk about it.

with all the murders,

39:34.580 --> 39:37.583
it's… it's making everything worse again.

39:37.666 --> 39:39.919
You've experienced trauma, Max,

39:40.795 --> 39:44.757
and when you keep your feelings,
your pain, bottled up the way you do,

39:44.840 --> 39:47.468
it doesn't take much
to trigger them again.

39:47.551 --> 39:50.012
So now, when it rains, it storms.

39:50.930 --> 39:52.139
Yeah, I know.

To where Chrissy was murdered.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.787
The cops asked me a bunch of questions.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.415
Did they talk to you?

40:17.498 --> 40:20.334
I mean, I know you were seeing Chrissy.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.503
Max, you know I can't talk about Chrissy

40:22.586 --> 40:23.712
or any other student.

40:23.796 --> 40:24.839
Yeah, but, I mean,

40:24.922 --> 40:28.175
what if there was a serial killer
on the loose in my neighborhood?

40:28.259 --> 40:29.969
Did Chrissy mention anything?

40:30.719 --> 40:33.097
Anything about who might have done this?

40:33.681 --> 40:36.559
Max, I'm… I'm sorry,
I… I really can't discuss this.

40:36.642 --> 40:39.770
You wouldn't want me talking
to any other students about you, right?

40:39.854 --> 40:43.399
If I were dead and it would
help catch the killer, then yeah,

40:43.482 --> 40:44.817
I most definitely would.

40:44.900 --> 40:47.445
Well, let's leave that up to the police,
shall we?

That's bullshit.

49:58.078 --> 50:00.998
Victor believed his house was haunted
by an ancient demon."

50:01.081 --> 50:04.668
"Victor allegedly hired a priest
to exorcise the demon from his home."

50:04.751 --> 50:07.295
Pretty novel for the '50s.
Exorcist wasn't out yet.

50:07.379 --> 50:08.338
Keep… Keep going.

50:09.965 --> 50:13.343
Okay, so Victor claimed
this exorcism failed,

50:13.427 --> 50:14.761
but it angered this demon,

50:14.845 --> 50:17.264
which then murdered his family,
removing their eyes.

50:17.347 --> 50:20.350
Victor believed he was spared
as a punishment.

50:20.434 --> 50:22.269
That's pretty convenient for Victor.

50:22.352 --> 50:24.146
Yeah, or super inconvenient.

50:24.813 --> 50:28.275
Victor was declared legally insane
by the court, right? What if this is why?

50:28.358 --> 50:30.819
It sounds insane.
Just didn't go public because--

50:30.902 --> 50:33.405
The plea bargain. The records were sealed.

50:34.156 --> 50:36.575
What if a demon did invade Victor's home?

50:37.284 --> 50:40.245
It's just, this demon
wasn't any old demon.

50:40.954 --> 50:41.872
It was Vecna.

50:43.832 --> 50:46.334
-Dustin, do you copy?
-[Dustin] Yeah, I copy.

50:46.418 --> 50:47.711
So, Nancy's a genius.

50:47.794 --> 50:50.380
Vecna's first victims date back
all the way to 1959.

50:50.464 --> 50:51.965
Her shot in the dark was a bull's-eye.

50:52.049 --> 50:55.385
Okay, that's totally bonkers,
but I can't really talk right now.

50:55.469 --> 50:56.678
What are you doing?

50:56.762 --> 50:57.929
Breaking and entering school

50:58.013 --> 51:00.682
to retrieve confidential
and extremely personal files.

51:00.766 --> 51:02.392
-[static]
-Can you repeat that?

51:02.476 --> 51:04.519
Just get your ass over here, stat.

51:04.603 --> 51:05.979
We'll explain everything.

51:06.063 --> 51:09.566
-Thought they were talking to Ms. Kelley.
-We leave them alone for two hours.

51:10.233 --> 51:12.235
[tense music playing]

51:20.994 --> 51:22.746
It's like a mini-Watergate or something.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.875
-[Dustin] Hawkinsgate.
-[Steve] Didn't those guys get caught?

51:26.958 --> 51:27.918
Holy shit.

51:28.001 --> 51:28.835
You found it?

51:28.919 --> 51:33.006
Yeah, and not just Chrissy's file.
Fred was seeing Ms. Kelley too.

51:34.716 --> 51:36.593
[tense music swells]

51:45.477 --> 51:49.022
[Jason] So, if Sinclair's right,
the freak is hiding here.

51:49.981 --> 51:52.150
We move through the woods here together,

51:52.234 --> 51:54.319
then Patrick and Andy, you split up.

51:54.402 --> 51:55.695
Go around this way.

51:56.238 --> 51:58.573
Me and Sinclair, we keep going,

51:58.657 --> 52:00.534
then flank his ass from both sides.

52:01.243 --> 52:02.661
That freak won't know what hit him.

52:03.954 --> 52:05.956
[tense music building]

52:18.635 --> 52:20.637
[tense music builds to climax]

52:20.720 --> 52:23.473
[music fades]

52:24.432 --> 52:26.476
[Owens] Sorry about all the theatrics.

52:26.560 --> 52:28.145
I… I didn't mean to scare you.

52:28.228 --> 52:31.857
But you got yourself into
quite the little predicament, didn't you?

52:32.482 --> 52:36.444
You know, I relocated you guys to Lenora
because I thought, you know,

52:36.528 --> 52:40.073
"Safe town, small, dull,
far from Hawkins."

52:40.157 --> 52:41.825
"Nothing could happen here."

52:41.908 --> 52:44.202
And what was it,
a roller skate or something?

52:45.579 --> 52:46.955
Ready to order some food?

52:47.038 --> 52:48.790
I think so. Yeah. I'll just… uh…

52:48.874 --> 52:52.002
Some more coffee and, um, I'll have a…

52:52.085 --> 52:53.587
How about the club special?

52:54.254 --> 52:56.256
Whatever you want, kiddo. It's on me.

52:56.339 --> 52:58.884
[country music playing faintly
in background]

52:58.967 --> 53:00.135
Waffles, please.

53:01.928 --> 53:04.598
Never too late in the day for breakfast,
that's what I say.

53:05.223 --> 53:06.641
Am I in trouble?

53:06.725 --> 53:09.186
For the roller skate thing?
No, no, no, no.

53:09.269 --> 53:11.271
We'll make that go away. Don't even…

53:11.354 --> 53:12.981
don't even worry about that.

53:13.064 --> 53:14.858
That's not why you're here?

53:14.941 --> 53:17.611
-[eerie music playing]
-To be honest with you, kid, I…

53:17.694 --> 53:18.945
I wish it was.

53:19.654 --> 53:22.616
Last night, I saw something.

53:23.158 --> 53:25.702
Something I've been dreading
for some time.

53:25.785 --> 53:28.622
I don't know how to say this
other than just to say it.

53:29.247 --> 53:31.208
Hawkins is in danger.

53:31.291 --> 53:33.293
[creatures screeching]

53:34.294 --> 53:35.420
[energy crackles]

53:35.921 --> 53:37.464
[Vecna growls]

53:37.547 --> 53:40.342
You have fought this evil before
and you've won.

53:40.425 --> 53:42.761
[Eleven screaming]

53:44.095 --> 53:46.056
But this evil, it's like a virus.

53:46.848 --> 53:49.643
Each time it returns,
it comes back stronger,

53:49.726 --> 53:52.020
smarter, deadlier.

53:54.564 --> 53:56.691
A war is coming to Hawkins.

53:59.945 --> 54:01.321
Where you at, freak?

54:02.405 --> 54:04.616
[dramatic synth music playing]

54:07.953 --> 54:11.623
-[Jason] You sure Eddie was here?
-Yeah. I… I'm… I'm positive.

54:12.791 --> 54:14.542
Let's check around the back.

54:14.626 --> 54:15.961
Around the back.

54:22.759 --> 54:25.387
[Owens] There are good people,
brave friends,

54:25.470 --> 54:28.098
who have helped you
fight your battle in the past.

54:30.183 --> 54:33.186
But they alone can't win this war,

54:34.312 --> 54:35.313
not without you.

54:36.982 --> 54:39.651
I know it's not fair to ask more of you,

54:39.734 --> 54:43.196
but I wouldn't be here
if I didn't think this was the only way,

54:43.280 --> 54:46.741
if I didn't think you were
the only one who might have a shot

54:46.825 --> 54:50.412
to hit this thing so hard
it can't get back up.

54:52.038 --> 54:53.832
I don't have my powers.

54:54.833 --> 54:58.295
What if I told you there was a way…

54:58.962 --> 55:00.630
a way to bring them back?

55:00.714 --> 55:03.049
[dramatic music playing]

55:03.133 --> 55:05.135
[helicopter whirring]

55:05.677 --> 55:09.264
I feared this moment would come,
so I've been preparing,

55:09.347 --> 55:12.475
developing the means
to restore your abilities.

55:15.061 --> 55:17.647
A program has the potential
to not just bring them back,

55:17.731 --> 55:19.858
but bring them back stronger than before.

55:20.567 --> 55:24.154
But there are others
who don't believe in you,

55:24.237 --> 55:26.197
who think you are the cause.

55:26.281 --> 55:27.824
I believe they're wrong.

55:28.450 --> 55:30.744
I believe you're the cure.

55:30.827 --> 55:32.954
That's why, if we're really gonna do this,

55:33.538 --> 55:35.874
I'm gonna ask that you leave with me now.

55:35.957 --> 55:37.667
The reservation's under "Byers."

55:37.751 --> 55:40.920
[Owens] But you should know
there is a very real possibility

55:41.004 --> 55:42.797
this program fails.

55:42.881 --> 55:46.092
And if it does,
you will never see your friends again.

55:46.843 --> 55:50.805
My friends in Hawkins, are they in danger?

55:50.889 --> 55:52.724
[dramatic music continues]

56:00.148 --> 56:02.317
[Owens] I'm afraid
your friends in Hawkins are very much…

56:02.400 --> 56:04.069
-Can I see Fred's file?
-Yeah.

56:04.152 --> 56:05.862
…in the eye of the storm.

56:07.030 --> 56:09.449
You may feel you need to go to them now,

56:09.532 --> 56:10.492
but if you do,

56:10.575 --> 56:12.869
you will risk everything,

56:12.952 --> 56:14.329
risk everyone.

56:16.998 --> 56:20.668
[echoing] Max, I know something's wrong.

56:22.504 --> 56:24.172
[shrill, high-pitched noise]

56:25.590 --> 56:27.717
[music increases in intensity]

56:33.098 --> 56:34.641
-[thunder rumbles]
-[gasps, pants]

56:34.724 --> 56:37.102
[Kelley] Max, what you've been through…

56:37.185 --> 56:38.019
[grunts]

56:38.103 --> 56:39.437
Billy!

56:39.521 --> 56:41.314
[Kelley] …it's a lot for anyone.

56:41.398 --> 56:42.982
And it's okay to not be okay.

56:43.942 --> 56:45.610
Max? What is it?

56:45.693 --> 56:47.821
[Dustin, echoing] Max! Max!

56:48.446 --> 56:50.532
[Vecna] Max.

56:50.615 --> 56:53.076
[Owens] They're not
the only ones in danger.

56:53.159 --> 56:55.370
It's life as we know it.

56:55.453 --> 56:57.956
-This is why I'm here.
-[purposeful music playing]

56:58.039 --> 57:00.375
Because I believe you are our best hope.

57:01.042 --> 57:02.293
Our only hope.

57:03.545 --> 57:05.463
What if I'm not good?

57:05.547 --> 57:07.966
What if I'm the monster?

57:08.049 --> 57:09.759
I don't know you that well, kiddo,

57:09.843 --> 57:14.681
but I'm betting the fate of the planet
that you're one of the good ones.

57:15.723 --> 57:17.725
But you've spent too much of your life

57:17.809 --> 57:20.812
being told what to do by people like me.

57:20.895 --> 57:22.230
I know that.

57:23.106 --> 57:25.817
So, you say the word
and I will take you back home.

57:26.317 --> 57:27.235
Or…

57:28.069 --> 57:29.362
come with me now.

57:30.196 --> 57:31.531
Find out for yourself.

57:32.490 --> 57:34.492
[purposeful music continues]

57:42.459 --> 57:43.460
[car rumbling]

57:43.543 --> 57:45.503
