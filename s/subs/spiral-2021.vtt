01:21.298 --> 01:23.692
WOMAN: Hey! My purse!
He's got my purse!

01:23.735 --> 01:25.259
-MAN: Hey, stop him!
-Come on.

01:27.391 --> 01:29.263
WOMAN: Somebody stop him!
He's got my purse!

01:29.306 --> 01:30.568
Police! Freeze!

01:33.745 --> 01:36.139
Hey! Stop! Out of my way!

01:36.183 --> 01:38.533
Get out of my way!
Out of my way! Police!

01:38.576 --> 01:39.577
Move!

01:45.235 --> 01:47.542
You did not
just go down there...

01:52.677 --> 01:54.157
What the fuck?

02:02.122 --> 02:03.384
Fuck sakes.

02:36.330 --> 02:38.462
Get your fucking hands
in the air!

02:41.073 --> 02:43.163
I ain't gonna
say it again, motherfucker!

02:50.561 --> 02:51.954
Fuck.

03:48.967 --> 03:50.969
Hello,
Detective Bozwick.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.841
-I want to play a game.
-No!

03:52.884 --> 03:55.800
The 3 train is arriving
in two minutes.

03:55.844 --> 03:57.759
It is up to you to decide

03:57.802 --> 04:00.283
if this will be
your final stop.

04:00.327 --> 04:03.155
You have taken
the witness stand many times,

04:03.199 --> 04:06.202
and railroaded innocent people
with your lies,

04:06.246 --> 04:08.813
putting them away in jail.

04:08.857 --> 04:11.903
Today, it is you
who will be railroaded.

04:11.947 --> 04:14.602
You have one chance to live.

04:14.645 --> 04:17.344
Tear from your mouth the tongue
that has so often been used

04:17.387 --> 04:19.259
to lie and to deceive.

04:19.302 --> 04:22.305
Take a leap of faith,
and you will live.

04:22.349 --> 04:24.046
Only your weight will rip away

04:24.089 --> 04:26.266
your lying tongue and save you.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.572
Live or die, make your choice.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.417
-

05:46.302 --> 05:48.957
MAN: What you talking about?
That movie won awards.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.394
ZEKE: You know, Tom Hanks
is a straight pimp, man,

05:51.438 --> 05:53.091
but I don't know if you could
make that movie today.

05:53.135 --> 05:54.702
MAN: What the fuck
you going on about?

05:54.745 --> 05:57.139
-Special needs abuse.
-MAN: Special needs?

05:57.182 --> 05:58.793
-What, you woke now?
-ZEKE: Not woke,

05:58.836 --> 06:01.491
but you can't say "handicapped,"
you can't say "retarded."

06:01.535 --> 06:04.102
You got to say "special needs,"
I'm trying to be respectful.

06:04.146 --> 06:07.323
Forrest Gump
was special needs, man.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.629
What was the name of the girl?

06:08.672 --> 06:10.152
-Jenny.
-ZEKE: Jenny.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.588
He did everything for Jenny.

06:11.632 --> 06:13.938
This motherfucker did some shit.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.724
He jogged across
the whole country.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.248
He beat China in ping-pong.

06:19.291 --> 06:21.293
You know how fucking hard
that shit is?

06:21.337 --> 06:22.773
He was a war hero.

06:22.817 --> 06:25.341
Who the fuck is nicer
than Forrest Gump?

06:25.385 --> 06:27.038
His best friend

06:27.082 --> 06:31.303
was a nigga and a white boy
with no legs.

06:31.347 --> 06:34.263
He made a billion dollars
selling shrimp.

06:34.306 --> 06:35.699
And she still wouldn't fuck him.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.788
Hey, eventually,
they got together.

06:37.832 --> 06:41.444
Yeah, after she got AIDS.

06:41.488 --> 06:44.404
As soon as she got AIDS,
she's like, "Hey, Forrest..."

06:44.447 --> 06:47.015
-Get the fuck out of here, man.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.060
Giving that guy AIDS?

06:49.104 --> 06:50.758
-Are you kidding me?
-Yeah.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.368
-That shit's abusive.
-But he ain't get it.

06:52.412 --> 06:56.111
I ain't see no sequel.
Where's Gump 2?

06:56.154 --> 06:57.634
Yo, Rico just got off
the elevator.

06:57.678 --> 06:59.157
-Oh, shit.
-

07:00.376 --> 07:02.030
Let's do this.

07:12.910 --> 07:14.521
Get down! Get down right now!

07:14.564 --> 07:16.348
Get down right now!
You know what this is!

07:16.392 --> 07:17.698
You know what this is!

07:17.741 --> 07:19.308
That's right! Put it all!
Come on! Down!

07:19.351 --> 07:20.744
Fill up this bag! Put it
in the motherfucking bag!

07:20.788 --> 07:22.006
MAN 1: Come on.

07:22.050 --> 07:24.008
-You know what to do!
-Chill!

07:24.052 --> 07:26.010
Get back!

07:26.054 --> 07:28.491
MAN 2: I want that coke!
I want that money!

07:28.535 --> 07:31.146
I want everything!

07:33.844 --> 07:35.977
Shit.

07:36.020 --> 07:38.414
MAN 3: Ninety seconds,
we gotta go!

08:21.979 --> 08:23.372
OFFICER: Freeze! Police!

08:23.415 --> 08:25.113
Hands up! Get your hands up!

08:25.156 --> 08:27.681
OFFICER 2: Get out of the car.
Get the fuck out of...

08:28.812 --> 08:30.553
Zeke? Is that you?

08:30.597 --> 08:31.859
Zeke?

08:33.382 --> 08:34.557
GARZA: What the fuck
is wrong with you?

08:34.601 --> 08:36.037
You do an undercover op...

08:36.080 --> 08:37.865
You don't clear it,
there's no coordination.

08:37.908 --> 08:39.562
We are Homicide,

08:39.606 --> 08:41.608
but you're robbing drug dealers
in a fucking hotel.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.871
I had a dozen 911 calls come in.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.655
What if someone got killed?

08:45.699 --> 08:47.701
That crew killed four people
last week, and we got them.

08:47.744 --> 08:50.747
And we could have got
more of them
if my cover wasn't blown.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.793
Fuck your cover, Zeke!

08:52.836 --> 08:57.362
You were off on your own,
as usual, no backup, nothing.

08:57.406 --> 09:00.278
No backup, 'cause there's
nobody on the force

09:00.322 --> 09:02.672
I can fucking trust!

09:02.716 --> 09:05.936
From now on, you're going
to learn to be a team player.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.156
You're getting a partner.
Jeannie, send Schenk in.

09:08.199 --> 09:11.115
Do I look like
a fucking Jamaican nanny?

09:11.159 --> 09:14.815
Do I smell like jerk sauce
and baby wipes? No!

09:14.858 --> 09:17.078
Me no want no partner!

09:17.121 --> 09:19.036
I'm not
babysitting some fucking rook.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.125
Yes, you are.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.998
Just because your dad was
Chief fucking Marcus Banks

09:24.041 --> 09:25.477
doesn't mean
you get out of the shit.

09:25.521 --> 09:27.088
Stop making this
about my father, okay?

09:27.131 --> 09:29.046
He's gone, you're the head
of the department now.

09:29.090 --> 09:30.526
Yeah. Drama queen.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.614
Zeke, it's been 12 years.

09:31.658 --> 09:34.530
Yes! Twelve fucking years.

09:34.574 --> 09:37.751
Twelve years ago,
I turned in a dirty cop,

09:37.794 --> 09:40.362
I get a medal for it.
Big fucking deal!

09:40.405 --> 09:42.146
I also got a bullet,

09:42.190 --> 09:44.975
and I got to look over my back
for the rest of my career.

09:45.019 --> 09:46.673
Shut up!

09:46.716 --> 09:48.196
It is too fucking hot in here

09:48.239 --> 09:50.024
for me to listen
to this bullshit.

09:50.067 --> 09:51.547
I got a heat wave going on.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.809
We got rolling blackouts,

09:52.853 --> 09:55.420
-the city is nuts. Stop!
-

09:55.464 --> 09:56.726
You wanted to see me, Captain?

09:56.770 --> 09:58.075
-Yeah, come in.
-

09:59.424 --> 10:00.774
Zeke, I want you to meet

10:00.817 --> 10:02.689
Detective in training,
William Schenk.

10:02.732 --> 10:05.822
He was the top of his academy,
so don't screw this up.

10:05.866 --> 10:08.825
Zeke is going to break you in,
show you the ropes.

10:08.869 --> 10:11.654
Detective Banks, it's good to...

10:11.698 --> 10:13.656
-Yup...
-

10:13.700 --> 10:15.789
-Go.
-Okay.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.312
Officer Harris, 1-0-3.

10:17.355 --> 10:18.748
Officer Harris, 1-0-3.

10:34.329 --> 10:35.852
Sergeant Jones, front desk.

10:35.896 --> 10:38.855
Sergeant Jones, front desk.

10:38.899 --> 10:43.338
So, uh... How do you take
your coffee in the morning?

10:43.381 --> 10:44.469
Alone.

10:46.558 --> 10:47.647
Okay.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.828
Hey, man, I get it.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.787
I wouldn't want to be stuck
with some random kid either.

10:57.831 --> 10:59.833
You don't want to be my partner.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.922
You don't know that.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.707
Your dad's the reason
for all of this.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.970
He's why I wanted to do this
in the first place.

11:07.014 --> 11:08.755
And I'm not him.

11:09.973 --> 11:12.236
Prepare to be underwhelmed.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.282
-GARZA: Banks and Schenk...

11:14.325 --> 11:17.241
Some homeless guy got hit
by the 3 train. You're up.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.419
Detective Peterson,

11:21.463 --> 11:23.247
pick up 2-2-1.
Detective Peterson, 2-2-1.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.169
SCHENK: This is you?

11:35.259 --> 11:36.608
Beats the squad car.

11:38.523 --> 11:41.570
Detective Banks
en route to that 10-19.

11:41.613 --> 11:43.615
Would that be north
or south side of the street?

11:43.659 --> 11:46.706
Northbound.
-ZEKE: Copy that.

11:46.749 --> 11:47.881
What are you doing?

11:48.795 --> 11:50.274
Oh, it's just family.

11:50.318 --> 11:53.147
This is my wife, Emma,
this is my son, Charlie.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.279
They're cute.
Enjoy it while it lasts.

11:55.323 --> 11:56.933
"While it lasts"?

11:56.977 --> 12:01.198
Nothing happier than the wife
of a new detective,

12:01.242 --> 12:02.591
and nothing more angry

12:02.634 --> 12:04.854
than that same bitch
10 years later.

12:04.898 --> 12:06.508
Maybe it's 'cause
you call them bitches.

12:06.551 --> 12:08.162
I'm half-Italian, trust me.

12:08.205 --> 12:09.816
Women do not like it
when you call them bitches...

12:09.859 --> 12:11.818
What are you telling me
about women,

12:11.861 --> 12:13.776
-young motherfucker? Shit.
-

12:13.820 --> 12:16.039
I just said it to you,
I didn't say it to a woman.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.781
I don't say it to their face.
It's not like I'm Too Short.

12:18.825 --> 12:21.175
We just met, but, you know,
you're firing already,
and I appreciate it.

12:21.218 --> 12:22.654
I mean, all I'm saying is,
you know,

12:22.698 --> 12:25.005
most crime happens
on weekends, holidays,

12:25.048 --> 12:27.224
so you would think
anybody married to a cop

12:27.268 --> 12:28.965
would understand this.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.358
But no.

12:30.401 --> 12:32.403
One day, your wife will be angry

12:32.447 --> 12:35.276
'cause you couldn't go to
her sister's birthday dinner.

12:35.319 --> 12:38.453
You can give a woman
600 Tuesdays.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.629
It ain't worth
three Saturday nights.

12:47.288 --> 12:51.161
So, uh... I'm guessing
you're divorced.

12:51.205 --> 12:55.644
Divorced, no, not yet.
I'm going through a divorce.

12:55.687 --> 12:58.603
That's even worse.
It's kind of like chemo.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.562
Shit. Sorry.

13:00.605 --> 13:04.435
Sorry for what? We're cops.
This is the life we choose.

13:04.479 --> 13:07.090
Highest divorce rate,
highest suicide rate.

13:07.134 --> 13:10.006
Highest rate
of domestic violence.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.139
Yo, when you decided
to become a cop,

13:12.182 --> 13:14.358
you pretty much assured yourself

13:14.402 --> 13:16.099
you were gonna die alone.

13:18.754 --> 13:21.191
SCHENK: My wife and I,
we're doing this counseling.

13:21.235 --> 13:24.673
She's got me, uh, working on,
like, communication.

13:24.716 --> 13:27.197
ZEKE: Counseling?
Yeah, that's nice.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.373
Yeah, my wife
fucked the counselor.

13:29.417 --> 13:30.766
Fuck, really?

13:30.810 --> 13:32.289
-ZEKE: Yeah.
-Jesus.

13:33.551 --> 13:34.944
ZEKE: Women cheat, too.

13:36.424 --> 13:40.080
It hurts. God damn it, it hurts.

13:40.123 --> 13:42.909
Women cheat, too,
but here's what happens.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.912
-Women cheat in the daytime.
-

13:45.955 --> 13:49.002
You can get away with
a lot of shit in the daytime.

13:49.045 --> 13:50.481
That's right. You can ride

13:50.525 --> 13:53.397
-a lot of dick before dusk.
-Mmm-hmm.

13:55.225 --> 13:58.750
Shit, man, I just found out
Pilates doesn't even exist.

13:59.751 --> 14:00.883
Wait, seriously?

14:02.015 --> 14:03.364
Emma loves Pilates.

14:03.407 --> 14:05.192
I'm sure she does.
I'm sure she does.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.150
But don't worry about it.

14:07.194 --> 14:10.937
You're gonna be fine.
You gonna be married forever.

14:15.724 --> 14:16.899
What do we got?

14:16.943 --> 14:18.161
See for yourself.

14:20.555 --> 14:21.861
Watch yourself.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.262
Ugh.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.874
If you're gonna throw up,
don't do it on the evidence.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.398
Are you kidding me?

14:37.441 --> 14:38.747
I've been dreaming about this
since I was 12 years old.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.184
Ugh.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.014
You see a lot of TV sets
on the subway?

14:46.494 --> 14:48.191
ZEKE: You get everything
down here.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.544
Damn. Wow.

14:56.547 --> 14:57.635
Ugh.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.904
SCHENK: This bum's
gonna be tough to ID.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.298
I'm not too sure this is a bum.

15:10.257 --> 15:13.477
I don't know a lot of bums
trying to get their steps in.

15:13.521 --> 15:17.264
Whoever this is, is married...

15:19.222 --> 15:21.181
and wears a Fitbit.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.295
This package just came in.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.861
-For me?
-OFFICER: Yeah.

16:00.089 --> 16:01.090
SCHENK: What is that?

16:05.573 --> 16:06.878
"Play me."

16:14.669 --> 16:16.105
-Okay.
-SCHENK: Whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

16:18.934 --> 16:20.501
Don't want to fuck up
my computer.

16:23.591 --> 16:25.549
Hello, Detective Banks.

16:25.593 --> 16:28.465
I'm here to help reform
the Metro Police,

16:28.509 --> 16:32.121
to remind them of their oath
to the people of this city.

16:32.165 --> 16:35.864
One officer from your station
refused to be reformed.

16:35.907 --> 16:38.693
He will not be the last
to play my game.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.913
If that spiral
is what I think it is...

16:41.957 --> 16:43.437
Jigsaw?

16:43.480 --> 16:45.047
Wait, I thought
the Jigsaw killer was dead?

16:45.091 --> 16:46.831
Yeah, but if it's
another copycat...

16:46.875 --> 16:48.529
It's gonna be a shit show.

16:48.572 --> 16:50.661
I recognize that building.

16:50.705 --> 16:52.011
It's the courthouse.

16:52.881 --> 16:54.013
Let's check it out.

17:14.381 --> 17:15.947
SCHENK: What are you guys
doing here?

17:15.991 --> 17:17.384
Well, we thought you boys
might need some backup.

17:17.427 --> 17:19.473
Fuck you, Fitch,
it's not your case.

17:20.648 --> 17:21.910
Yo, Zeke.

17:30.310 --> 17:31.615
What do we got here?

17:42.539 --> 17:43.801
What the fuck is that?

17:44.976 --> 17:46.239
Is that a fucking tongue?

17:50.156 --> 17:52.375
Fucking shit.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.429
4-5-3... Who's 4-5-3?

18:07.695 --> 18:08.739
GARZA: Circle up!

18:10.132 --> 18:12.047
Okay, here's what we know.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.962
Dental records confirm it's Boz.

18:14.745 --> 18:16.921
Sorry, guys.

18:16.965 --> 18:20.534
But, look, we got to catch
the son of a bitch
that did this.

18:20.577 --> 18:22.536
Train conductor says
he didn't see much.

18:22.579 --> 18:23.972
Says he saw
Boz hanging in the air

18:24.015 --> 18:25.669
right before
he hit the windshield.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.889
Says he thinks he saw Boz
bleeding from the mouth badly.

18:27.932 --> 18:30.152
The package was sent
from a delivery service

18:30.196 --> 18:32.763
that picked it up
on a stoop on Anglin Drive.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.243
What about the spirals?

18:34.287 --> 18:35.984
Hey, Cap, obviously
it's a Jigsaw copycat,

18:36.027 --> 18:38.117
so that's where we got to
concentrate our focus.

18:38.160 --> 18:40.423
Sure, Fitch, but I want you
to stick with hard evidence.

18:40.467 --> 18:43.165
Kraus, contact the Feds,
get anything they got.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.689
Files, old videos, anything.

18:45.733 --> 18:47.169
Do we have street images?

18:47.213 --> 18:48.692
We're working on it,
but Digital Forensics was

18:48.736 --> 18:50.390
able to map Boz's movement
off the Fitbit.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.522
Last place it was registered
was Stuart's Point,

18:52.566 --> 18:54.785
time-stamped
during the fireworks.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.787
Someone needs to call Kara,
his wife, let her. know.

18:56.831 --> 18:57.919
Yeah, I already called her.

19:00.356 --> 19:02.141
You called Kara?

19:02.184 --> 19:03.925
Yeah.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.927
-Do you know Kara?
-No.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.712
Did you actually talk to her,
or did you text her?

19:08.756 --> 19:11.367
Let me guess,
you sent an emoji.

19:11.411 --> 19:13.108
Do they have
a dead husband emoji?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.805
I talked to her, asshole.

19:14.849 --> 19:18.461
Hey. We had to notify her
before it leaked to the press.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.680
Okay, O'Brien's got point...

19:19.723 --> 19:20.724
O'Brien?

19:21.899 --> 19:24.206
This is mine.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.469
Me and the rook
were first on scene.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.385
Banks...

19:29.429 --> 19:32.258
I'm sorry, isn't this protocol?

19:32.301 --> 19:33.955
Now you're part of
the team again, Zeke?

19:39.003 --> 19:40.570
Fuck you.

19:40.614 --> 19:42.093
No, fuck you.

19:42.137 --> 19:43.747
Come on, Zeke.

19:43.791 --> 19:46.924
When all you motherfuckers
were treating me like shit,

19:46.968 --> 19:50.232
shooting me in my fucking back,

19:50.276 --> 19:52.582
Boz was my friend!

19:54.193 --> 19:56.412
Boz played with my kid.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.197
We went to fucking games.

19:59.546 --> 20:03.027
Fuck me? No, fuck you.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.249
Fucking assholes...

20:07.293 --> 20:11.079
GARZA: Zeke! Zeke, fucking stop!

20:14.038 --> 20:16.302
In here! Now!
-

20:20.697 --> 20:22.612
Zip up! Get out.

20:22.656 --> 20:23.874
OFFICER: Okay, Captain.

20:28.749 --> 20:32.056
-Damn, nigga, wash your hands.
-

20:32.100 --> 20:34.145
I get why you want this.

20:34.189 --> 20:37.018
Boz was my friend, too,
but you can't do this alone.

20:37.061 --> 20:39.803
I need the whole department
on this, working together.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.936
I'm not trying
to do this alone, okay?

20:41.979 --> 20:45.940
Boz is my family, man.
You gotta let me take lead.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.468
You gotta let me catch
this motherfucker.

20:57.691 --> 21:00.346
All right, guys,
we got a change of plans.

21:02.478 --> 21:03.697
Banks is taking lead.

21:05.351 --> 21:06.917
ZEKE: Listen up.

21:06.961 --> 21:09.529
I know some of you guys
think I'm a rat.

21:10.965 --> 21:12.619
Some of you think I'm a snitch.

21:14.751 --> 21:17.798
Some of you are mad
I fucked your mother.

21:19.974 --> 21:23.151
Boz was last seen

21:23.194 --> 21:25.980
at the July 4th parade
at Stuart's Point...

21:27.634 --> 21:30.289
...so there should be plenty
of surveillance footage,

21:30.332 --> 21:32.595
so check your hashtags,
Instagram...

21:32.639 --> 21:34.423
Hey!

21:34.467 --> 21:37.687
Now, we got a dead cop here,
guys, who was brutally killed.

21:37.731 --> 21:40.951
A fallen brother
whose tongue was ripped out.

21:40.995 --> 21:43.606
We need to focus on the case
and solve this.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.739
So get the footage
to Detective Banks

21:45.782 --> 21:47.523
and put your
personal shit aside.

21:48.785 --> 21:50.570
O'Brien, you good?

21:50.613 --> 21:51.919
No problem here, Captain.

21:52.615 --> 21:53.616
GARZA: Good.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.706
Let's go.

22:04.758 --> 22:05.889
Yo, where we going?

22:05.933 --> 22:08.065
Pay our respects. Put on a suit.

22:26.997 --> 22:28.303
Zeke...

22:28.347 --> 22:30.087
-Kara...
-

22:30.697 --> 22:32.046
It's okay.

22:32.089 --> 22:34.440
Whoever did this,
I'm gonna find them.

22:34.483 --> 22:37.356
I don't understand...
How did it happen?

22:37.399 --> 22:39.445
WOMAN: Kara,
your mother's on the phone.

22:39.488 --> 22:40.576
KARA: Yeah, okay.

22:41.142 --> 22:42.143
Zeke.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.014
Lisa.

22:46.669 --> 22:49.411
You okay? I, uh... I texted you.

22:49.455 --> 22:50.630
Yeah, I got it.

22:51.848 --> 22:53.459
Is Brian here?

22:53.502 --> 22:55.330
No, my sister's watching him.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.986
Your sister... So, Rhonda gets
to see my son, but I don't?

23:00.509 --> 23:02.032
Are we really gonna
do this here?

23:03.991 --> 23:07.211
No. Not today.

23:07.255 --> 23:08.430
-Hey, I'm William.
-ZEKE: Stop.

23:08.474 --> 23:09.431
Zeke's partner, yup...

23:18.614 --> 23:20.094
I'll wait outside.
I'll wait outside.

23:20.137 --> 23:22.183
KARA: Jamie's at the neighbor's.

23:22.226 --> 23:25.447
I don't know
how I'm supposed to tell him
what happened to his dad.

23:25.491 --> 23:28.407
ZEKE: I can't imagine
what you're going through
right now.

23:31.366 --> 23:33.586
I know this is a bad time,

23:33.629 --> 23:36.589
but I got to ask you
a couple of questions.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.419
In the last few weeks,

23:40.462 --> 23:43.334
did you notice anything unusual?

23:43.378 --> 23:47.817
I mean, did Boz say anything,
or act stressed out?

23:49.645 --> 23:51.212
He was a cop, Zeke.

23:51.255 --> 23:53.040
So nothing out of the ordinary?

23:53.083 --> 23:54.998
KARA: No.

23:55.042 --> 23:57.348
There was one thing,
there was a black SUV

23:57.392 --> 23:59.438
parked outside
one night last week.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.918
You get a make?

24:01.962 --> 24:04.747
-Range Rover, Escalade, Lincoln?
-I don't know.

24:04.791 --> 24:07.489
I told Boz about it
and he went out,

24:07.533 --> 24:09.535
and he walked up,
and, I don't know,

24:09.578 --> 24:12.015
the next thing I know, he was
yelling at somebody inside.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.756
Any idea
what they were yelling about?

24:13.800 --> 24:15.323
Did you hear anything?

24:15.366 --> 24:18.544
No. If I see it again,
I'll get a license plate.

24:18.587 --> 24:21.416
If you don't mind,
could you get me his devices?

24:21.460 --> 24:24.898
I need to look
at his iPad, laptop.

24:24.941 --> 24:27.030
-Yeah.
-Thanks, Kara.

24:31.687 --> 24:34.037
Nice... I gotta go, guys.
All right, be safe.

24:37.650 --> 24:38.738
Zeke.

24:39.956 --> 24:41.871
He knew you were a good cop.

24:41.915 --> 24:43.438
You find out who did this.

25:28.396 --> 25:31.268
You pull a gun on your old man?

25:31.312 --> 25:32.574
You out of your fucking mind?

25:32.618 --> 25:34.054
I could have killed you.

25:34.097 --> 25:35.664
What are you talking about?
I got the gun.

25:35.708 --> 25:38.101
I could have killed you.

25:38.145 --> 25:39.538
How'd you get in here?

25:39.581 --> 25:41.452
Did you forget
who the landlord is?

25:41.496 --> 25:42.758
Yeah, but that doesn't
give you the right

25:42.802 --> 25:44.673
to just walk in here
anytime you want.

25:44.717 --> 25:46.414
Renters got rights.

25:46.457 --> 25:47.807
You start paying some rent,
you can get some rights.

25:51.419 --> 25:54.291
Heard about Boz. You all right?

25:56.206 --> 25:57.947
No, Dad, I'm... I'm fucked up.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.777
Sorry to hear that.
I know how close you were.

26:04.258 --> 26:09.437
That could be difficult.

26:09.480 --> 26:10.830
-What are you saying?
-Nothing.

26:10.873 --> 26:12.440
Just, you know,
being lead detective,

26:12.483 --> 26:14.094
a lot of responsibility.

26:14.137 --> 26:15.965
You got a problem with that?

26:16.009 --> 26:18.185
Or are you just scared
I'm gonna embarrass you?

26:18.228 --> 26:19.969
See? That right there.

26:21.405 --> 26:23.233
This ain't about you.

26:23.277 --> 26:25.671
You always making shit
about you.

26:25.714 --> 26:27.760
That's the shit
that ruined your career

26:27.803 --> 26:29.370
and your marriage.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.459
So, now you're giving
fatherly advice?

26:31.502 --> 26:33.330
What you talkin' 'bout, Willis?

26:33.374 --> 26:36.682
Dad. We live
in the same building.

26:36.725 --> 26:38.858
I saw you out front
the other day,

26:38.901 --> 26:41.904
you nodded at me
like we were the only
two black guys in the mall.

26:41.948 --> 26:44.428
We haven't had a meal together
in over a year.

26:44.472 --> 26:46.822
Haven't had a meal?

26:46.866 --> 26:48.258
What? Are you hungry, nigga?

26:48.302 --> 26:49.912
You want to go get
a fucking slice?

26:50.870 --> 26:52.480
Let me tell you something.

26:52.523 --> 26:57.659
My father went to work,
came home. That was it.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.183
All right, I'm gonna
get out of here, son.

27:00.227 --> 27:02.621
I'm gonna go to Kara's,
pay my respects.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.711
You're gonna be all right.

27:05.754 --> 27:08.583
Come over tonight,
I'll order some food,
we'll go over the case.

27:19.986 --> 27:22.858
Just because your dad
was Chief fucking
Marcus Banks...

27:22.902 --> 27:24.904
Stop making this
about my father.
Twelve years ago,

27:24.947 --> 27:27.210
I turned in a dirty cop.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.691
-ZEKE: Pete! Pete!

27:29.735 --> 27:30.910
What happened? What happened?

27:30.953 --> 27:32.520
He pulled a gun on me.

27:34.435 --> 27:36.524
The witness pulled a gun on you?

27:36.567 --> 27:40.484
Because there's nobody
on the force
I can fucking trust!

28:00.766 --> 28:03.856
I've been staring at this shit
for five hours.

28:03.899 --> 28:05.771
I don't even look at porn
that long.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.824
Okay, I'm out. What's next?

28:15.868 --> 28:18.044
Well, why don't you check
with Digital Forensics

28:18.087 --> 28:21.787
and see if anybody
in Boz's phone log
has a black SUV?

28:21.830 --> 28:23.571
SCHENK: My phone is dead,
you got a charger?

28:23.614 --> 28:25.181
Your phone's dead,
what are you, a little girl?

28:25.225 --> 28:26.705
Let me borrow your phone,
shut up.

28:26.748 --> 28:27.749
Okay.

28:27.793 --> 28:29.403
SCHENK: Thank you.

28:29.446 --> 28:31.927
Don't drain my battery
watching Twilight.

28:36.889 --> 28:39.674
Glad to see you joined us.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.763
You think this is linked
to John Kramer?

28:41.807 --> 28:45.375
I sent some pictures
to the Feds,
we'll see what happens.

28:45.419 --> 28:47.551
GARZA: How are we doing
on surveillance?

28:47.595 --> 28:50.424
Please tell me the $20 million
the city spent on cameras
got us something?

28:50.467 --> 28:51.468
Drury?

28:52.948 --> 28:56.604
Street cameras
from here to here

28:56.647 --> 28:58.345
have already been
scrubbed through.

28:58.388 --> 29:00.564
Facial recognition came up
with nothing.

29:00.608 --> 29:03.437
There were two cameras
broken on this corner.

29:03.480 --> 29:05.569
Fitch and Kraus are there now
to canvas it.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.759
No. Closed. Closed.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.973
FITCH: There's Boz.

30:02.191 --> 30:03.845
KRAUS: Who's that he's chasing?

30:03.889 --> 30:05.716
FITCH: I know that guy.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.850
Benny Wrights. He's a hustler.

30:08.894 --> 30:10.460
Serious tweaker.

30:10.504 --> 30:13.115
Flops in a burnt-out
bread factory down on 12th.

30:13.159 --> 30:15.988
Deals with a pusher,
street name Speez.

30:16.031 --> 30:18.686
-Should we tell Zeke?
-Fuck him.

30:18.729 --> 30:21.080
I'll take the building,
you track down Speez.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.694
Hey, boss, let me see
that gun over there.

30:26.737 --> 30:29.131
The one on the left.
Yeah, yeah, come on, come on.

30:34.049 --> 30:36.617
On behalf of the Metro Police,

30:36.660 --> 30:38.401
I want to thank you
for your generosity.

30:45.191 --> 30:47.149
I got shit to do. I'm out.

30:48.368 --> 30:49.586
What's his deal?

30:49.630 --> 30:51.371
He's a crooked piece of shit.

30:52.981 --> 30:54.765
-Let's just call it a night.
-SCHENK: You sure?

30:54.809 --> 30:56.245
Yeah. Go home.

30:56.289 --> 30:58.117
Go see your wife,
go see your kid.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.205
What's your boy's name?

30:59.248 --> 31:00.859
-Charlie.
-Charlie.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.164
All right, I'll put him down
and come right back.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.862
No, no, no,
I'm not going to be here.

31:03.905 --> 31:05.646
Meeting my dad for dinner,
gonna go over the case.

31:05.689 --> 31:06.690
Okay.

31:08.823 --> 31:09.868
Hey, William.

31:09.911 --> 31:10.869
Yeah?

31:12.479 --> 31:13.828
Good work today.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.919
Thanks, man.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.573
-See you tomorrow.
-ZEKE: Yeah.

31:45.773 --> 31:47.818
-FITCH: Benny?

32:00.570 --> 32:01.920
Wake up, Benny.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.800
Rise and shine, my man.

32:15.803 --> 32:18.327
Benny, come on. Get up.

32:20.721 --> 32:22.114
Come on, Benny, get up.

32:22.157 --> 32:23.376
-

32:25.900 --> 32:26.901
You all right?

32:32.776 --> 32:34.169
Fuck me.

32:54.146 --> 32:55.582
This is Deborah Kraus,
leave me a message.

32:55.625 --> 32:56.844
Kraus, call me.

33:01.892 --> 33:03.416
Lieutenant Tim O'Brien here,

33:03.459 --> 33:04.721
leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

33:25.090 --> 33:26.352
-

33:34.925 --> 33:37.319
Help! Help me!

33:48.374 --> 33:50.637
-

34:00.951 --> 34:02.518
Hello, Detective Fitch.

34:03.519 --> 34:05.130
I want to play a game.

34:12.528 --> 34:14.574
-SCHENK: Hey, Zeke.
-William.

34:14.617 --> 34:16.271
What are you doing up?

34:16.315 --> 34:17.620
I told you to take
the rest of the night off.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.535
Uh, it's fine,
Charlie's sleeping.

34:19.579 --> 34:21.624
-Was sleeping.

34:21.668 --> 34:23.844
Just waiting for Emma
to get home,
she's having a girl's night.

34:23.887 --> 34:27.021
Girl's night out. Okay.

34:27.065 --> 34:28.501
You better be careful with that,

34:28.544 --> 34:30.198
might be a dick night out.

34:30.242 --> 34:32.244
Just because
you're getting a divorce,

34:32.287 --> 34:34.115
it doesn't mean
that everyone else's marriages
have to end, too.

34:35.464 --> 34:37.466
Sounds like
you got your hands full.

34:37.510 --> 34:38.598
You want to call me back?

34:38.641 --> 34:40.382
Nah, it's okay,

34:40.426 --> 34:42.036
we're sleep-training.
It's a fucking nightmare.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.125
Look, man, um... I know
you and Boz were close,

34:44.169 --> 34:45.866
I don't know
how to tell you this.

34:45.909 --> 34:48.521
You got something to say,
William, say it.

34:48.564 --> 34:51.001
Well, I'm looking through
all the Metro records
like you asked,

34:51.045 --> 34:53.830
and Boz was accused of lying
on the stand
more than anybody...

34:55.180 --> 34:57.182
by like a wide fucking margin.

34:57.225 --> 34:58.313
ZEKE: Jesus.

34:59.184 --> 35:00.663
The courthouse...

35:02.535 --> 35:04.972
That's why the tongue
was at the courthouse.

35:09.629 --> 35:11.152
ZEKE: Can I help you?

35:11.196 --> 35:12.545
Are you Marcus Banks?

35:12.588 --> 35:14.721
-No, I'm his son.
-Well, Terroni delivery.

35:14.764 --> 35:15.983
Oh, okay.

35:22.032 --> 35:23.121
Dad!

35:49.103 --> 35:50.931
Pop, got your food.

36:07.165 --> 36:09.602
Motherfucker!

36:09.645 --> 36:11.995
How the fuck
could you not call me first?

36:12.039 --> 36:13.649
I tried, but you didn't answer.

36:13.693 --> 36:16.478
Well, why didn't you wait for me
to fucking call you back?

36:16.522 --> 36:18.524
'Cause you would have
talked me out of it.

36:18.567 --> 36:19.873
I told the truth.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.570
Get the fuck
out of my face, Zeke.

36:21.614 --> 36:23.093
Can we get the room?

36:26.836 --> 36:28.186
God damn it.

36:30.231 --> 36:32.451
I knew I should have never
let him become a cop.

36:35.715 --> 36:38.196
This shit's gonna go
sideways fast.

36:38.239 --> 36:40.328
He turned in a dirty cop.
Pete was a scumbag.

36:40.372 --> 36:41.764
Press will make him out
to be a hero.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.331
And what about the other cops?

36:43.375 --> 36:44.854
You think they're gonna
call him a hero, too?

36:46.029 --> 36:47.727
He did the right thing.

36:47.770 --> 36:50.208
You know how much internal
damage control I have to do?

36:50.251 --> 36:52.035
We'll handle it.

36:52.079 --> 36:54.516
-We always do, huh?
-

36:54.560 --> 36:57.432
MAN: Chief Banks,
WF Action News here.

37:01.523 --> 37:03.133
-Are you in?

37:07.877 --> 37:10.228
Oh, I'm sorry,
but I think your face

37:10.271 --> 37:12.795
was trespassing on my property.

37:12.839 --> 37:14.232
Is there something
I can help you with?

37:14.841 --> 37:16.234
No.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.236
All right. Fuck you very much.

37:44.479 --> 37:46.176
COURIER GUY:
For Detective Zeke Banks.

37:52.574 --> 37:54.184
OFFICER: Banks, incoming.

37:54.228 --> 37:55.708
On my desk. Right now.

37:55.751 --> 37:56.970
A courier brought it.

37:57.013 --> 37:58.145
We're holding him
for questioning.

38:15.989 --> 38:17.947
Hello, Detective Banks.

38:17.991 --> 38:21.081
Salvation was offered,
but it was declined.

38:21.124 --> 38:23.126
This fucker thinks he's Jigsaw.

38:23.170 --> 38:24.954
Even got a doll this time.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.435
I have a bone to pick
with the police department,

38:27.479 --> 38:29.611
and if you're going
to point fingers...

38:29.655 --> 38:31.352
GARZA: 12th Street Bridge.
I know that place.

38:31.396 --> 38:33.659
...you should start by
pointing them at yourselves.

38:33.702 --> 38:35.356
Geez, that's two blocks away.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.446
Until you come clean,
many more will die.

38:55.158 --> 38:56.508
OFFICER 1: Stay back.

38:58.510 --> 38:59.946
OFFICER 2: Stay sharp.

39:11.305 --> 39:13.046
OFFICER 3: Whoa,
hold it there, guys.

39:38.985 --> 39:40.508
OFFICER:
What a sick fuck, man.

39:47.950 --> 39:49.212
What the fuck?

39:49.256 --> 39:50.431
Oh, no...

39:55.915 --> 39:57.569
OFFICER: God almighty.

39:57.612 --> 39:58.874
9-8-2.

39:58.918 --> 40:01.616
-It's Fitch.

40:01.660 --> 40:02.704
This is Detective Banks

40:04.271 --> 40:06.447
I'm on Decker Street.
Request backup!

40:06.491 --> 40:07.840
-Fuck him.
-ZEKE: In pursuit,

40:22.332 --> 40:24.334
-Ah, fuck!
-Fuck me.

40:32.908 --> 40:34.562
PARAMEDIC: You're going
to be okay, stay with me.

40:34.606 --> 40:35.911
You're good,
you're gonna be okay.

40:35.955 --> 40:37.130
You're gonna be just fine.

40:37.173 --> 40:38.392
-Zeke!
-Sir! Please, please!

40:38.436 --> 40:40.002
Let us do our job, come on.

40:40.046 --> 40:41.656
Come on, let us do our jobs,
let's go. Let's go.

40:41.700 --> 40:45.051
Where the fuck
were all of you, huh?

40:45.094 --> 40:48.533
My son called for backup
three times in eight minutes

40:48.576 --> 40:50.448
and none of you motherfuckers
could get here?

40:51.536 --> 40:53.494
Nobody? Nothing?

40:53.538 --> 40:56.149
Crickets. All right,
this is what I'm going to do.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.151
I'm going to call Dispatch

40:58.194 --> 41:01.633
and find out
who was closest available,

41:01.676 --> 41:05.158
and when I do,
I'm going to take this gun

41:05.201 --> 41:06.812
and shoot that motherfucker.

41:06.855 --> 41:09.336
-We clear?
-

41:09.379 --> 41:11.381
-Fitch, it was you?
-

41:11.425 --> 41:12.861
You fucking with my son again?

41:12.905 --> 41:15.690
-God damn you, son of a bitch!

41:15.734 --> 41:17.126
Get off me!

41:17.170 --> 41:18.432
You're done, motherfucker,
you hear me?

41:18.476 --> 41:19.999
You're fucking done!

41:20.042 --> 41:22.567
Don't let me see
your face again.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.700
ZEKE: All right, call Kraus,

41:25.744 --> 41:27.833
find out Fitch's last location.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.063
Hello, Detective Fitch.

41:42.064 --> 41:43.675
I want to play a game.

41:43.718 --> 41:47.940
The tide of justice
is rising around you.

41:47.983 --> 41:50.595
In 90 seconds,
the water will rise

41:50.638 --> 41:52.771
to the height
of the copper wires,

41:52.814 --> 41:55.077
and if you are still
in the tank,

41:55.121 --> 41:56.949
you will be electrocuted.

41:56.992 --> 42:00.126
Unless you make the sacrifice
that will cleanse you.

42:00.169 --> 42:01.867
FITCH: God... Oh, God...

42:01.910 --> 42:04.652
You murdered a man
because he insulted you.

42:04.696 --> 42:06.219
Put your hands

42:06.262 --> 42:08.003
where I can see them,
motherfucker.

42:08.047 --> 42:09.875
I said put your hands
where I can see them, sir.

42:14.357 --> 42:16.272
Your finger pulled the trigger

42:16.316 --> 42:19.449
and that cannot happen again.

42:19.493 --> 42:23.236
Survival is simple,
but it comes with a sacrifice.

42:23.279 --> 42:26.456
Bite down on the device
in your mouth,

42:26.500 --> 42:27.936
which will start the motor

42:27.980 --> 42:29.764
that will
rip your fingers away...

42:29.808 --> 42:31.374
-...leaving you free

42:31.418 --> 42:33.202
to escape with your life.

42:33.246 --> 42:35.074
But if you don't act quickly,

42:35.117 --> 42:38.207
all that awaits you
is this watery tomb.

42:38.251 --> 42:41.471
Live or die, make your choice.

42:41.515 --> 42:43.299
-

42:43.343 --> 42:45.563
-

43:35.351 --> 43:37.353
-

43:44.796 --> 43:46.362
-

44:15.783 --> 44:17.742
-

44:21.441 --> 44:25.053
Hey, Kraus, anything special
about the bridge
where we found the fingers?

44:25.097 --> 44:26.794
Yeah, why that bridge?

44:26.838 --> 44:30.406
It was where he shot that kid,
Jimmy Lincoln.

44:30.450 --> 44:33.061
ZEKE: Then how did you guys
find out about this place?

44:33.105 --> 44:34.497
This guy, Benny Wrights,

44:34.541 --> 44:36.804
who Boz was last seen with
on July 4th.

44:36.848 --> 44:39.111
How do you know
who Boz was last seen with?

44:39.154 --> 44:41.722
We took it off a pawn shop feed
in Stuart Point.

44:41.766 --> 44:42.984
And you didn't tell me.

44:44.856 --> 44:46.640
Who the fuck did this?

44:46.684 --> 44:48.903
Somebody who has it out
for the Metro PD.

44:50.557 --> 44:52.994
Or maybe just for Fitch.

44:53.038 --> 44:54.866
You trying to
say something, Drury?

44:54.909 --> 44:56.258
You know what I'm saying.

44:56.302 --> 44:58.173
I doubt you'll be
shedding tears for Fitch.

44:58.217 --> 44:59.697
All right, come on.
Come on, Zeke.

44:59.740 --> 45:01.089
ZEKE: Fucking asshole.

45:01.133 --> 45:02.395
Okay, ignore him.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.572
Did you get anything?

45:05.615 --> 45:10.925
Got a name. Benny Wrights.
Last guy Boz was seen with.

45:10.969 --> 45:13.798
Okay, find him,
and you got hours, not days.

45:15.930 --> 45:18.150
ZEKE: And this is where
Benny gets his meth.

45:19.325 --> 45:20.630
You know what that is?

45:21.544 --> 45:24.112
SCHENK: Is this a test?

45:24.156 --> 45:26.724
-Just asking you a question.
-Uh, it's a meth house.

45:26.767 --> 45:28.638
You put the money in the bucket,
the meth comes down.

45:28.682 --> 45:31.772
Oh, somebody watched The Wire.

45:31.816 --> 45:35.167
This is some
New Jack Cityshit. Goddamn.

45:43.088 --> 45:45.699
Don't we need
a warrant for this?

45:45.743 --> 45:47.005
What you talking about?

45:49.137 --> 45:50.486
Zeke...

45:51.618 --> 45:53.620
ZEKE: Hey, my man, my man.

45:53.663 --> 45:55.230
Just trying to get a five,
me and my lady!

45:55.274 --> 45:57.450
It's our anniversary,
we're trying to celebrate,

45:57.493 --> 45:58.799
trying to do
something special.

45:58.843 --> 46:01.149
Can I get a five?
How about this iPad?

46:01.193 --> 46:03.630
It's got everything on it.

46:03.673 --> 46:06.807
I got passcodes,
I got Netflix, Hulu,

46:06.851 --> 46:10.202
uh, Uber Eats, Postmates.
Lots of food, lots of food.

46:10.245 --> 46:11.464
Let me see that...

46:11.507 --> 46:12.682
Yo, man,
get the fuck out of here.

46:12.726 --> 46:14.293
Do I look
fucking hungry to you?

46:14.336 --> 46:15.947
Yo, yo, it got everything.
It don't fit, though.

46:15.990 --> 46:17.035
Why don't you come down?

46:17.078 --> 46:18.297
Get the fuck out of here!

46:18.340 --> 46:19.820
Come back
when you get some money!

46:19.864 --> 46:22.214
Okay, okay. I need money,
I need money.

46:22.257 --> 46:23.389
No, no, no, no,
wait, wait, wait!

46:23.432 --> 46:24.607
I got some,
I got some money.

46:24.651 --> 46:26.087
I got some money,
hold up a second.

46:26.131 --> 46:27.654
Hold up a second, all right?

46:29.264 --> 46:31.353
All right, send it down, baby.

46:31.397 --> 46:33.921
Come on, come on,
let's do this.

46:36.532 --> 46:37.533
Can't wait!

46:39.753 --> 46:40.928
SCHENK: Zeke, what the fuck?

46:40.972 --> 46:41.929
ZEKE: It's got 10 seconds,
come on!

46:41.973 --> 46:43.017
SCHENK: Jesus Christ.

46:47.195 --> 46:49.632
What the fuck?

46:49.676 --> 46:51.634
-Move!
-Get out of the way.

46:51.678 --> 46:54.724
Out of my way,
out of my way! Police!

46:54.768 --> 46:56.335
MAN: Five-o!

46:56.378 --> 46:58.380
-Everybody, five-o!
-Move, move, move! Come on!

46:58.424 --> 46:59.512
Go! Coming through.

46:59.555 --> 47:00.948
MAN: Fucking cops, man.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.082
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

47:04.125 --> 47:05.953
Shit! Get your dog!

47:05.997 --> 47:08.260
-MAN: Fuck you, man.
-Get your fucking dog!

47:09.565 --> 47:11.176
-Now!
-Hey, be nice.

47:12.612 --> 47:14.179
Jesus Christ.

47:14.222 --> 47:15.833
Holy fucking shit.

47:21.360 --> 47:22.622
What the fuck's going on?

47:22.665 --> 47:23.536
SCHENK: Back inside.
Get back inside.

47:26.017 --> 47:27.279
Hide your shit!

47:34.721 --> 47:36.462
-DRUG DEALER: Come on!

47:37.245 --> 47:38.246
Fuck. Fuck!

47:49.257 --> 47:50.476
DRUG DEALER: My fucking leg!

47:50.519 --> 47:52.347
Why do you make this shit
so hard?

47:52.391 --> 47:54.045
What if I really wanted
to get fucked up?

47:54.088 --> 47:55.655
DRUG DEALER: Motherfucker...

47:55.698 --> 47:58.005
You got to make it easy
for the customer, skeeve!

47:58.049 --> 48:00.703
DRUG DEALER: My fucking leg!

48:00.747 --> 48:04.316
That leg is fucked up.

48:04.359 --> 48:05.534
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

48:05.578 --> 48:06.622
Let me get a shot
for the Gram.

48:06.666 --> 48:08.363
Hold on for one second.

48:08.407 --> 48:09.408
DRUG DEALER: What the fuck...
ZEKE: Hold on, hold on.

48:09.974 --> 48:11.323
My man.

48:11.366 --> 48:14.021
Here we go!
You want me to tag you?

48:14.065 --> 48:15.544
DRUG DEALER: Fuck... Fuck you.

48:15.588 --> 48:17.155
-Can I tag you, motherfucker?
-Fuck you...

48:18.939 --> 48:20.245
You see this man before?

48:20.288 --> 48:22.377
I ain't telling you shit!

48:22.421 --> 48:24.771
Why, 'cause you're worried
about that bone
sticking out your leg?

48:24.814 --> 48:26.555
Why don't you
let me sterilize it?

48:26.599 --> 48:30.864
No... No... No! Fuck!

48:35.260 --> 48:37.523
It's Benny! Stop, please!

48:37.566 --> 48:39.177
Everybody knows that
motherfucker Benny Wrights!

48:41.919 --> 48:43.790
He's one of
my best customers, man.

48:43.833 --> 48:46.097
When was the last time
you saw him?

48:46.140 --> 48:47.663
I ain't seen the bitch
in two days, man.

48:47.707 --> 48:50.579
Word on the street
is that motherfucker OD'd.

48:52.842 --> 48:54.061
SCHENK: Fuck this snitch.

48:54.105 --> 48:56.672
DRUG DEALER: Fuck!

48:56.716 --> 48:59.153
-

48:59.197 --> 49:00.981
SCHENK: Well,
that was a waste of time.

49:01.025 --> 49:03.723
Well, we know Benny's dead.

49:03.766 --> 49:06.204
Meth isn't the type of thing
you take a break from.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.990
Besides, you see that device?

49:10.034 --> 49:13.167
That was not designed
by anybody with rotten teeth.

49:13.211 --> 49:15.300
What do you think about
this whole Jigsaw angle?

49:15.343 --> 49:17.693
You think it's a,
what-do-you-call-them,
one of those disciples?

49:17.737 --> 49:20.392
John Kramer
didn't target cops.

49:20.435 --> 49:22.742
Whoever did this
has another motive.

49:22.785 --> 49:24.135
Something personal.

49:24.178 --> 49:25.875
And they're not
following orders,

49:25.919 --> 49:28.052
especially the orders
of a ghost.

49:28.095 --> 49:30.619
Ghost or not,

49:30.663 --> 49:33.535
somebody's out there
pulling all the strings.

49:33.579 --> 49:35.233
You think this guy
sent you the boxes

49:35.276 --> 49:36.886
because you're the
lead detective on the case,

49:36.930 --> 49:38.279
or because you're you?

49:38.323 --> 49:39.759
I don't know.

49:39.802 --> 49:42.980
Well, you got any enemies?
That aren't cops?

49:44.982 --> 49:47.419
MAN: I don't know why she
won't give me another chance.

49:47.462 --> 49:50.030
I don't know, maybe
it's because you beat her

49:50.074 --> 49:51.466
when you drink too much.

49:51.510 --> 49:53.033
You ever think of that?

49:53.077 --> 49:56.645
That's some tough love.
Who the hell is this guy?

49:56.689 --> 49:59.909
Ex-cop.
Partner snitched on him,

49:59.953 --> 50:03.174
had to do nine years
hard time.

50:03.217 --> 50:06.699
The system spit him out,
now here he is.

50:10.572 --> 50:11.573
Hey, Pete.

50:17.405 --> 50:18.493
Zeke.

50:20.104 --> 50:23.020
Last guy
I expected to see here.

50:23.063 --> 50:24.369
You trying to get sober?

50:24.412 --> 50:26.458
Alcohol's not my problem.

50:26.501 --> 50:28.460
The glass and the bottle
can kill.

50:29.417 --> 50:31.376
How you doing, Pete?

50:31.419 --> 50:33.421
Eighteen months sober,
living in a church basement,

50:33.465 --> 50:34.727
who could ask
for anything more?

50:36.250 --> 50:38.644
Who's this?

50:38.687 --> 50:40.559
Detective Schenk.
We're working a case together.

50:40.602 --> 50:41.951
PETE: Working together?

50:41.995 --> 50:43.388
Don't let this guy
catch you jaywalking,

50:43.431 --> 50:45.042
or he'll stab you
right in the fucking back.

50:45.085 --> 50:48.088
Don't forget, Pete,
you gave me the knife.

50:48.132 --> 50:50.134
You're right, I did.

50:50.177 --> 50:51.657
And you witnessed this cop

50:51.700 --> 50:53.354
throw the victim
off a rooftop?

50:53.398 --> 50:55.835
And you saw it,
I mean, with your own eyes?

50:55.878 --> 50:57.967
And you can positively ID
this cop?

50:58.011 --> 51:00.274
He's had his foot on the neck
of this community
for way too long.

51:01.710 --> 51:03.190
We can't have this.

51:03.234 --> 51:06.541
I'll testify,
Officer Dunleavy. I'll do it.

51:13.244 --> 51:16.203
Pete! Pete! What happened?
What happened?

51:17.248 --> 51:18.466
He pulled a gun on me.

51:20.425 --> 51:23.471
The witness
pulled a gun on you?

51:23.515 --> 51:27.301
I was mad for a long time,
but now I take responsibility.

51:27.345 --> 51:29.216
I should have never
pulled the trigger.

51:31.175 --> 51:32.785
The guy had a family.

51:32.828 --> 51:35.440
It was crazy back then, right?

51:35.483 --> 51:37.224
We were working
under Article 8.

51:39.313 --> 51:41.315
We were out of control.

51:41.359 --> 51:44.231
Cops were given
their own discretion
to crack down on crime.

51:44.275 --> 51:47.278
Where were you July 4th
at 9:30 p.m.?

51:47.321 --> 51:51.238
Really?
That's what you're here for?

51:51.282 --> 51:53.545
That's what I'm here for.

51:53.588 --> 51:57.026
Look, some guy came
to a meeting drunk

51:57.070 --> 51:59.551
and wanted to fight a sponsor,
so I hit him.

51:59.594 --> 52:01.683
Knocked him clean out.

52:01.727 --> 52:03.729
Anyway, the cops came.
I'm still on probation,

52:03.772 --> 52:05.905
but lucky for me,
it was O'Brien.

52:05.948 --> 52:08.603
He let the whole thing slide
because, you know...

52:11.258 --> 52:12.346
loyalty.

52:13.347 --> 52:14.435
Loyalty.

52:15.567 --> 52:16.655
Take care, Pete.

52:18.047 --> 52:19.658
God loves you, Zeke.

52:21.616 --> 52:23.096
More than you.

52:29.233 --> 52:31.235
SCHENK: Can't believe
that guy used to be a cop.

52:31.278 --> 52:33.237
He shot an innocent guy,
but you turned on him?

52:33.280 --> 52:36.283
There's a code, and you better
learn how to follow it,

52:36.327 --> 52:38.894
or you're going to spend
the rest of your life
watching your back.

52:39.678 --> 52:41.897
Fair point.

52:41.941 --> 52:43.377
Maybe it's a good thing
they made us partners.

52:48.077 --> 52:49.514
Leave a message.

52:49.557 --> 52:51.168
Yeah, Dad,
I'm at your apartment.

52:51.211 --> 52:52.473
I was here last night.

52:52.517 --> 52:54.432
It doesn't look like
you've been home.

52:59.524 --> 53:00.742
All right, give me a call.

53:15.801 --> 53:17.150
You've
gotten through to William,

53:17.194 --> 53:18.934
leave a message
after the beep.

53:18.978 --> 53:20.632
Schenk, it's 9:00 a.m.,

53:20.675 --> 53:23.200
where the fuck are you?
Give me a call.

53:23.243 --> 53:24.723
JEANNIE: Just tell me
what happened, okay?

53:24.766 --> 53:27.813
Hey! Hey! Hey!

53:27.856 --> 53:29.206
Put the box on the ground!

53:29.249 --> 53:31.425
On the ground!
Hands up! Hands up!

53:31.469 --> 53:33.079
On the ground now!
Hands up, hands up!

53:35.081 --> 53:36.169
Don't move!

53:39.172 --> 53:40.173
Get him out of here.

53:41.043 --> 53:42.219
Take him to holding.

53:44.308 --> 53:46.223
JEANNIE: I'm sorry, Banks,
he blew right past me.

53:50.488 --> 53:51.924
No way, Zeke,
that one is not the same.

53:51.967 --> 53:53.360
I'm calling the bomb squad.

53:53.404 --> 53:55.406
Angie, you're the head
of the department.

53:55.449 --> 53:57.059
We got two dead cops,
there's no time.

53:58.800 --> 54:00.454
Get everybody out.

54:00.498 --> 54:02.369
Everybody out! Everybody out!

54:03.327 --> 54:04.415
Everybody, go!

54:25.392 --> 54:27.612
-Is that fucking skin?
-Ugh.

54:27.655 --> 54:30.832
ZEKE: "Am I getting under
your skin, Detective Banks?

54:30.876 --> 54:35.402
"Careful, while you're looking
for more bodies to drop,

54:36.316 --> 54:38.362
"I'll take your head."

54:38.405 --> 54:40.189
"I'll take your head..."

54:40.233 --> 54:43.671
"Am I getting
under your skin...

54:43.715 --> 54:45.064
"Am I getting
under your skin...

54:45.107 --> 54:47.632
"Am I getting
under your skin..."?

54:51.984 --> 54:53.942
...family.
This is my wife, Emma,

54:53.986 --> 54:55.204
this is my son, Charlie.

55:03.212 --> 55:04.475
What the fuck is that?

55:06.738 --> 55:08.217
Captain, there's something
under here.

55:17.270 --> 55:19.185
Constantine Paints.

55:39.205 --> 55:40.249
O'BRIEN: Thanks, yeah.

55:40.293 --> 55:41.294
OFFICER: Follow me.

55:48.301 --> 55:50.956
O'BRIEN: How do you know
about this place?

55:50.999 --> 55:53.393
Zeke, how do you know
about this place?

55:53.437 --> 55:56.135
My dad used to take me here.

55:56.178 --> 55:57.658
Watch your step, gentlemen.

55:57.702 --> 56:00.008
It wasn't always
a butcher shop.

56:00.052 --> 56:02.924
Used to be Constantine Trains.

56:04.230 --> 56:05.884
Like a hobby shop.

56:21.116 --> 56:22.204
O'BRIEN: Oh, my God.

56:43.182 --> 56:44.836
-ZEKE: Anything?
-

56:44.879 --> 56:46.577
FORENSICS: Well, we're
analyzing the tape recording.

56:46.620 --> 56:48.535
Hello, Detective Schenk,

56:48.579 --> 56:50.407
I want to play a game.

56:50.450 --> 56:54.323
You were head of your class
at the Police Academy.

56:54.367 --> 56:56.108
He was obviously skinned...

56:57.457 --> 56:59.285
postmortem.

56:59.328 --> 57:00.765
Your dad's the reason I wanted
to do this in the first place.

57:00.808 --> 57:02.114
FORENSICS:
...the body was scored first

57:02.157 --> 57:04.638
to remove the pieces
in larger strips,

57:04.682 --> 57:07.641
arms, neck,
as he ripped the skin...

57:09.556 --> 57:11.863
Maybe it's a good thing
they made us partners.

57:11.906 --> 57:13.255
FORENSICS:
Even the defensive wounds,

57:13.299 --> 57:14.779
he clearly tried to fight back,

57:14.822 --> 57:16.476
which explains
the deeper gashes.

57:24.745 --> 57:26.138
REPORTER: Captain, over here.

57:26.181 --> 57:27.966
Is it a serial killer
targeting cops?

57:28.009 --> 57:29.837
Is the victim inside
a policeman?

57:29.881 --> 57:32.187
No comment. Commissioner Hart
will make a statement tonight.

57:35.103 --> 57:36.888
We got to try
to keep his identity

57:36.931 --> 57:39.020
out of the press
until I tell his wife.

57:41.458 --> 57:44.809
ZEKE: "Am I getting under
your skin, Detective Banks?"

58:09.050 --> 58:10.356
Hey, O'Brien.

58:10.399 --> 58:11.444
O'BRIEN: Yeah, boss?

58:11.488 --> 58:12.489
You seen Zeke?

58:13.577 --> 58:15.230
No, not for a while.

58:15.274 --> 58:16.667
Okay, I'm heading down
to Cold Case.

58:16.710 --> 58:18.277
Copy that, Captain.

58:21.672 --> 58:23.108
DISPATCHER:
I need all available units,

58:23.151 --> 58:25.110
officer down 3rd and Beaman.

58:25.153 --> 58:27.373
Please report, 3rd and Beaman.

58:44.433 --> 58:46.087
ZEKE: What do we got?

58:46.131 --> 58:48.873
I was writing a ticket
and some guy in a pig's mask,

58:48.916 --> 58:50.396
he runs up on me with a knife.

58:50.439 --> 58:52.137
So, he stabs your arm
and just takes off?

58:52.180 --> 58:53.530
I fought him off
the best I could and he...

58:53.573 --> 58:55.140
He took off running.

58:55.183 --> 58:58.186
Is there any reason
he would have to attack you?

58:58.230 --> 59:01.581
No. He just wanted
to mess with the cops.

59:01.625 --> 59:05.585
"Careful, while you're looking
for more bodies to drop,

59:05.629 --> 59:07.065
"I'll take your head."

59:07.108 --> 59:09.589
Angie, you're the head
of the department.

59:09.633 --> 59:11.025
Angie...

59:11.069 --> 59:12.374
Ah, fuck!

59:12.418 --> 59:14.028
-Angie! Pick up!

59:22.689 --> 59:24.125
Hey, you've
reached Captain Angie Garza,

59:24.169 --> 59:24.865
leave a message at the tone.
Thanks.

59:30.697 --> 59:34.658
Angie, get to the bullpen!
He's coming for you.

59:42.143 --> 59:44.102
Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck.

59:46.844 --> 59:47.932
Shit!

59:48.933 --> 59:51.805
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1:00:02.468 --> 1:00:05.950
Hello? Hello! Shit!

1:00:18.136 --> 1:00:20.486
-

1:01:07.794 --> 1:01:09.709
Help!

1:01:12.669 --> 1:01:14.148
Hello, Captain Garza.

1:01:14.192 --> 1:01:15.802
I want to play a game.

1:01:15.846 --> 1:01:18.370
You have covered up corruption
in your department,

1:01:18.413 --> 1:01:21.068
never sticking your neck out
for the innocent.

1:01:21.112 --> 1:01:23.505
Now, the cover-up
will be on you.

1:01:23.549 --> 1:01:26.160
In a few seconds,
boiling hot wax

1:01:26.204 --> 1:01:28.554
will be coming out of the pipe
above you.

1:01:28.597 --> 1:01:31.688
The only way to stop yourself
from being suffocated

1:01:31.731 --> 1:01:33.602
is to sever your spinal cord

1:01:33.646 --> 1:01:35.604
with the blade
beneath your neck,

1:01:35.648 --> 1:01:37.215
which will stop the wax.

1:01:37.258 --> 1:01:38.695
You cannot walk away,

1:01:38.738 --> 1:01:40.348
-but you can survive.
-

1:01:40.392 --> 1:01:42.263
Live or die, make your choice.

1:01:43.569 --> 1:01:45.440
Fuck you!

1:01:53.884 --> 1:01:57.365
Angie! Angie!

1:01:57.409 --> 1:01:59.193
Get the fuck out of the way!

1:01:59.237 --> 1:02:01.935
-

1:02:15.688 --> 1:02:17.342
How come no one
is answering the phone?

1:02:17.385 --> 1:02:19.170
An officer was attacked,
it's fucking chaos in here.

1:02:19.213 --> 1:02:22.303
ZEKE: Angie! Angie!

1:02:26.351 --> 1:02:27.352
Angie?

1:02:28.222 --> 1:02:29.702
Zeke, what's going on?

1:02:29.746 --> 1:02:30.790
ZEKE: He's got her!

1:02:30.834 --> 1:02:31.835
Who's got her?

1:02:31.878 --> 1:02:33.837
The killer has Angie!

1:02:33.880 --> 1:02:35.142
I guess you didn't hear,
the killer just

1:02:35.186 --> 1:02:36.840
attacked a cop
at 3rd and Beaman.

1:02:36.883 --> 1:02:40.278
That was just a diversion
to get us out of the precinct.

1:02:40.321 --> 1:02:42.106
She's down
in the fucking basement!

1:02:52.812 --> 1:02:53.857
Did you find Angie?

1:02:53.900 --> 1:02:55.815
In the basement,
in the basement!

1:02:55.859 --> 1:02:57.643
Captain Angie Garza,

1:02:57.686 --> 1:02:59.340
call the front desk.

1:03:14.878 --> 1:03:15.879
ZEKE: Open it!

1:03:16.749 --> 1:03:18.098
Hurry up!

1:03:19.056 --> 1:03:20.535
Angie!

1:03:21.841 --> 1:03:22.886
Open it!

1:03:22.929 --> 1:03:23.930
Okay.

1:03:28.500 --> 1:03:29.501
Shit!

1:03:31.590 --> 1:03:35.246
It's okay, it's okay.
It's gonna be fine.

1:03:35.289 --> 1:03:36.334
Oh, my God.

1:03:41.121 --> 1:03:42.427
It's okay.

1:03:43.428 --> 1:03:44.429
It's okay... Oh...

1:04:43.270 --> 1:04:44.576
ZEKE: Lock it down.

1:04:44.619 --> 1:04:46.099
You understand me?

1:04:46.143 --> 1:04:48.536
Lock it down, nobody gets out
of this precinct.

1:04:48.580 --> 1:04:51.191
I need all the footage
from the cameras

1:04:51.235 --> 1:04:52.497
in the evidence room.

1:04:53.367 --> 1:04:54.455
OFFICER: Okay, here...

1:04:54.499 --> 1:04:55.892
Here's when the call came in,

1:04:55.935 --> 1:04:58.372
but then there's nothing
until you come in.

1:04:58.416 --> 1:05:03.638
You see right there, it jumps
from 13:11 to 13:24. Glitch?

1:05:03.682 --> 1:05:05.814
No, there's no glitch,
because look,

1:05:05.858 --> 1:05:07.381
on the first frame,
the safe door is open,

1:05:07.425 --> 1:05:08.817
but on the next, it's shut.

1:05:08.861 --> 1:05:10.167
There's 13 minutes missing.

1:05:10.210 --> 1:05:11.733
Access to this footage,

1:05:11.777 --> 1:05:13.344
is that through
the computer system?

1:05:13.387 --> 1:05:14.954
Yeah, we just need
a badge number and a password.

1:05:14.998 --> 1:05:16.956
I can't tell you
who deleted the video,

1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:20.220
but I can access
who logged into the server
over the past day.

1:05:20.264 --> 1:05:23.832
O'Brien, Tupper, Nicholazi...

1:05:23.876 --> 1:05:27.271
Wait...
Who's badge number 2-1-3?

1:05:27.314 --> 1:05:29.142
Pete Dunleavy, my old partner.

1:05:29.186 --> 1:05:31.231
Dunleavy?
He shouldn't have access.

1:05:31.275 --> 1:05:33.494
How long's it been
since he was even on the job?

1:05:34.756 --> 1:05:35.801
Where you going?

1:05:35.844 --> 1:05:37.281
To pay Pete a visit.

1:05:37.324 --> 1:05:39.718
Zeke, he's not the only one!

1:05:39.761 --> 1:05:41.111
Your father had access, too.

1:05:41.154 --> 1:05:42.851
Location of Schenk's body,

1:05:42.895 --> 1:05:45.245
you said it was where
your father took you as a kid.

1:05:45.289 --> 1:05:47.204
When was the last time
you saw your father?

1:05:49.510 --> 1:05:51.251
-This morning.
-Bullshit.

1:05:52.731 --> 1:05:53.993
ZEKE: Motherfucker!

1:05:54.037 --> 1:05:55.081
JEANNIE: What the fuck, Zeke?

1:05:55.125 --> 1:05:56.691
ZEKE: Fuck you, man!

1:05:56.735 --> 1:05:58.215
-O'BRIEN: Fuck you!
-Get the fuck out of here!

1:05:58.258 --> 1:06:02.175
Get him out of here! Fuck you!
You're too close!

1:06:02.219 --> 1:06:03.872
You're too close
to this thing, Zeke.

1:06:16.537 --> 1:06:17.538
Pete!

1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:19.801
Pete!

1:06:21.064 --> 1:06:22.021
Pete!

1:06:29.115 --> 1:06:31.291
Leave a message.

1:06:31.335 --> 1:06:34.468
Dad, I've called you
three times,

1:06:34.512 --> 1:06:36.818
please call me back!

1:06:36.862 --> 1:06:40.387
People are asking questions
and I'm sick of
making excuses.

1:06:40.431 --> 1:06:42.824
You got something
to tell me? Fuck!

1:07:49.456 --> 1:07:51.371
You wanna play games,
motherfucker?

1:07:52.590 --> 1:07:54.592
All right, I'll play.

1:09:35.432 --> 1:09:36.476
You okay?

1:09:39.740 --> 1:09:40.915
Hey!

1:09:48.009 --> 1:09:49.402
Help!

1:11:25.846 --> 1:11:26.847
Pete?

1:11:28.501 --> 1:11:30.198
Pete, wake up.

1:11:30.242 --> 1:11:31.243
Pete!

1:11:35.421 --> 1:11:37.249
What? Zeke?

1:11:37.293 --> 1:11:38.381
Fuck.

1:11:39.512 --> 1:11:41.079
Get me the fuck down, Zeke.

1:11:41.558 --> 1:11:42.646
Come on!

1:11:42.689 --> 1:11:44.125
You hacked the computer.

1:11:45.518 --> 1:11:47.825
You erased
the surveillance footage.

1:11:47.868 --> 1:11:49.435
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, Zeke.

1:11:49.479 --> 1:11:51.307
-Did you kill Angie?
-What?

1:11:51.350 --> 1:11:52.656
Did you kill Boz?

1:11:52.699 --> 1:11:53.700
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1:11:53.744 --> 1:11:55.136
Did you kill Boz?

1:11:55.180 --> 1:11:57.051
Boz? Fuck...

1:11:57.095 --> 1:11:58.139
What the fuck
is with you, Zeke?

1:11:58.183 --> 1:11:59.576
Get me the fuck out of here!

1:11:59.619 --> 1:12:02.230
Is this some sick
fucking revenge, Zeke?

1:12:02.274 --> 1:12:04.320
Putting me in jail
isn't enough, huh?

1:12:04.363 --> 1:12:05.756
Get me the fuck out of here!

1:12:15.374 --> 1:12:17.245
Hello, Detective Banks.

1:12:17.289 --> 1:12:19.247
I want to play a game.

1:12:19.291 --> 1:12:22.250
When Peter Dunleavy
murdered an innocent man,

1:12:22.294 --> 1:12:24.949
your career
was shattered like glass.

1:12:24.992 --> 1:12:26.994
Can you stand on the sidelines

1:12:27.038 --> 1:12:29.693
while justice
is finally served?

1:12:29.736 --> 1:12:31.521
There is a way to save him,

1:12:31.564 --> 1:12:35.525
or you can keep him locked up
and throw away the key.

1:12:35.568 --> 1:12:37.918
The decision is yours.

1:12:37.962 --> 1:12:39.790
"Throw away the key,"
what the fuck?

1:12:39.833 --> 1:12:42.401
-Huh?

1:12:53.543 --> 1:12:55.414
Get me the fuck
out of this thing.

1:12:57.242 --> 1:12:58.243
Zeke!

1:12:59.462 --> 1:13:02.073
Oh, shit.

1:13:07.078 --> 1:13:08.166
PETE: Come on, Zeke.

1:13:09.907 --> 1:13:11.125
Get me the fuck
out of here, Zeke!

1:13:18.394 --> 1:13:19.482
Shit!

1:13:25.662 --> 1:13:27.185
Zeke! Help me!

1:13:29.056 --> 1:13:31.450
-

1:13:32.843 --> 1:13:33.887
Zeke?

1:13:35.759 --> 1:13:37.325
Get me down, come on, man.

1:13:41.417 --> 1:13:43.723
-

1:13:57.345 --> 1:13:58.390
Zeke!

1:14:03.351 --> 1:14:05.528
Zeke!

1:14:05.571 --> 1:14:07.791
DISTORTED VOICE: ...or
you can keep him locked up

1:14:07.834 --> 1:14:09.532
and throw away the key.

1:14:10.533 --> 1:14:11.534
Pete!

1:14:28.855 --> 1:14:29.900
I'm coming, Pete!

1:14:40.388 --> 1:14:42.303
-

1:14:45.219 --> 1:14:46.220
ZEKE: Shit.

1:14:47.439 --> 1:14:49.572
Fuck. I got you, I got you.

1:14:53.663 --> 1:14:54.664
Come on, Pete.

1:15:00.321 --> 1:15:01.409
Pete!

1:15:02.106 --> 1:15:03.194
Pete!

1:16:10.566 --> 1:16:13.264
ZEKE: You disloyal
piece of shit.

1:16:17.529 --> 1:16:21.011
I've been loyal to you
since the first day we met.

1:16:22.099 --> 1:16:24.318
Fifteen years ago.

1:16:24.362 --> 1:16:26.669
The day your partner
killed my father.

1:16:29.628 --> 1:16:31.804
So, Charlie,

1:16:31.848 --> 1:16:34.415
you saw this cop throw
the victim off a rooftop,

1:16:34.459 --> 1:16:36.679
and you can positively ID
this cop?

1:16:36.722 --> 1:16:38.942
I'll testify, Officer Dunleavy.

1:16:38.985 --> 1:16:40.073
I'll do it.

1:16:49.343 --> 1:16:52.956
ZEKE: Pete! Pete!
What happened, what happened?

1:16:52.999 --> 1:16:54.261
PETE: He pulled a gun on me.

1:16:54.305 --> 1:16:55.959
The witness
pulled a gun on you?

1:17:00.398 --> 1:17:01.660
Shh.

1:17:01.704 --> 1:17:03.749
Pete killed Charlie Emmerson.

1:17:03.793 --> 1:17:06.012
What? You thought
I'd use my real name?

1:17:06.056 --> 1:17:08.014
Do you have any idea
how hard it was

1:17:08.058 --> 1:17:09.668
to get placed
in this department,

1:17:09.712 --> 1:17:11.844
to get assigned
to be your partner?

1:17:15.282 --> 1:17:18.024
What about your family,
what about your son?

1:17:18.068 --> 1:17:19.504
SCHENK: This is my son,
Charlie.

1:17:22.289 --> 1:17:23.377
I don't have a son.

1:17:25.728 --> 1:17:26.990
Charlie's sleeping...

1:17:27.033 --> 1:17:28.905
-...was sleeping.

1:17:28.948 --> 1:17:30.733
After Benny Wrights led Boz
down the subway tunnels...

1:17:34.562 --> 1:17:36.303
I tattooed my dad's name
on his arm.

1:17:39.089 --> 1:17:40.656
Where is my father?

1:17:40.699 --> 1:17:42.092
You'll see him soon.

1:17:42.135 --> 1:17:43.876
Where the fuck is my father?

1:17:43.920 --> 1:17:46.705
I didn't even ask him
to come down here. You did.

1:17:46.749 --> 1:17:47.793
Let me borrow your phone,
shut up.

1:17:47.837 --> 1:17:48.881
ZEKE: Okay.

1:17:48.925 --> 1:17:50.709
Thank you.

1:17:50.753 --> 1:17:52.189
ZEKE: And don't drain
my battery watching Twilight.

1:18:12.688 --> 1:18:14.690
Where is he?

1:18:14.733 --> 1:18:16.169
Don't you want to hear
my offer?

1:18:16.213 --> 1:18:17.301
Do I have a choice?

1:18:18.345 --> 1:18:20.826
I want to be partners.

1:18:20.870 --> 1:18:23.916
You took a stand, Zeke,
against a dirty cop,

1:18:23.960 --> 1:18:25.091
and what did it get you?

1:18:27.528 --> 1:18:31.228
A lifetime of watching
your back, working alone.

1:18:31.271 --> 1:18:33.099
Getting the call
for every homeless bum

1:18:33.143 --> 1:18:34.753
who turns up dead.

1:18:34.797 --> 1:18:35.885
I mean, let's be real,
some of these motherfuckers

1:18:35.928 --> 1:18:37.713
are straight up evil.

1:18:37.756 --> 1:18:39.671
Fitch not backing you up...

1:18:39.715 --> 1:18:41.238
-Fuck him.
-

1:18:42.456 --> 1:18:43.762
He won't repeat that mistake.

1:18:46.112 --> 1:18:48.419
And Boz,
always lying under oath...

1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:52.162
But you, you're different.

1:18:52.205 --> 1:18:54.904
You're Metro's finest.

1:18:54.947 --> 1:18:56.906
That's why I want to
team up with you on this.

1:18:56.949 --> 1:19:00.300
You find the dirty cops
and I'll take care
of the rest.

1:19:00.344 --> 1:19:03.086
You want me to help you
kill cops?

1:19:03.129 --> 1:19:04.522
No, fuck no.

1:19:04.565 --> 1:19:06.567
Just the bad ones.

1:19:06.611 --> 1:19:10.049
John Kramer was right,
the spiral.

1:19:10.093 --> 1:19:14.314
A symbol of change,
evolution, progress.

1:19:14.358 --> 1:19:16.142
But why limit that
to an individual

1:19:16.186 --> 1:19:18.449
when you can apply it
to a whole system?

1:19:18.492 --> 1:19:20.799
You got shot
for doing the right thing.

1:19:20.843 --> 1:19:22.322
But let's face it, these cops?

1:19:22.366 --> 1:19:23.671
They're not going to clean up
on their own.

1:19:23.715 --> 1:19:25.978
But we take a tongue here,

1:19:26.022 --> 1:19:28.589
a few bones there,
they'll come around.

1:19:28.633 --> 1:19:31.767
We're going to fix
a broken department. Okay?

1:19:31.810 --> 1:19:33.159
You and me.

1:19:33.203 --> 1:19:34.204
Okay.

1:19:35.596 --> 1:19:36.597
Okay.

1:19:37.381 --> 1:19:38.904
Let's do it.

1:19:38.948 --> 1:19:41.907
I want to trust you. I do.

1:19:41.951 --> 1:19:44.867
I'm in. But my dad goes free.

1:19:50.307 --> 1:19:52.352
One second.

1:19:52.396 --> 1:19:54.746
DISPATCHER: 911,
please state your emergency.

1:19:54.790 --> 1:19:56.792
Hello, uh, I'm at
the old soap factory

1:19:56.835 --> 1:19:58.054
on Madigan Lane.

1:19:58.097 --> 1:19:59.533
There's a crazy guy
with a gun,

1:19:59.577 --> 1:20:01.492
he's firing it everywhere.
Please hurry!

1:20:01.535 --> 1:20:03.146
What the fuck was that?

1:20:03.189 --> 1:20:05.017
SCHENK: You better hurry,
Zeke, SWAT's on the way.

1:20:05.061 --> 1:20:07.585
Look, I want to believe you,
I do.

1:20:10.066 --> 1:20:11.154
I want to trust you.

1:20:12.329 --> 1:20:13.939
Take this, you'll need it.

1:20:13.983 --> 1:20:14.984
Come on.

1:20:16.899 --> 1:20:18.378
Let's go see your dad.

1:20:26.822 --> 1:20:27.910
It's time for your final test.

1:20:40.183 --> 1:20:41.532
ZEKE: Dad.

1:20:41.575 --> 1:20:42.620
Ezekiel.

1:20:42.663 --> 1:20:44.056
Oh, shit! Get him down!

1:20:49.366 --> 1:20:50.671
Oh, shit.

1:20:53.849 --> 1:20:54.893
I got you, Dad.

1:20:54.937 --> 1:20:56.503
BANKS: Zeke. Help me, son.

1:20:59.985 --> 1:21:01.639
Don't worry, don't worry.

1:21:01.682 --> 1:21:04.468
I'm not going to let you die.
I will get you down.

1:21:08.820 --> 1:21:09.995
It's all right, just hold on.

1:21:10.039 --> 1:21:11.997
Shoot this motherfucker
right now.

1:21:13.694 --> 1:21:16.480
Get him down!
Get him down now!

1:21:17.785 --> 1:21:19.700
I thought we were partners.

1:21:19.744 --> 1:21:21.964
You going to shoot me, Zeke?

1:21:22.007 --> 1:21:23.313
With your one bullet?

1:21:23.356 --> 1:21:24.444
Bad idea.

1:21:24.488 --> 1:21:25.793
It kills your dad.

1:21:28.448 --> 1:21:30.015
He took a shot at me,
by the way.

1:21:30.842 --> 1:21:31.887
Missed.

1:21:31.930 --> 1:21:33.497
I wasted four.

1:21:33.540 --> 1:21:35.238
That means
you got one shot left, Zeke.

1:21:37.196 --> 1:21:41.157
All right, cops are here.
That gives us four minutes.

1:21:41.200 --> 1:21:43.724
Do you know
there's 1.5 gallons of blood
in the human body, Zeke?

1:21:48.077 --> 1:21:50.253
At the rate
your old man is bleeding out,

1:21:50.296 --> 1:21:53.169
in just three minutes,
those jars will be full

1:21:53.212 --> 1:21:56.041
and your dad will be dead.

1:21:56.085 --> 1:21:57.608
The only thing
that can set him free

1:21:57.651 --> 1:22:01.612
is the bullet in your gun
fired at that target.

1:22:01.655 --> 1:22:03.875
Either way, I've got
a foolproof way out of here.

1:22:05.659 --> 1:22:06.660
You're not Jigsaw.

1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:08.401
That's the game.

1:22:09.620 --> 1:22:12.275
Shoot me and you both lose.

1:22:12.318 --> 1:22:15.017
Shoot the target
and we both win.

1:22:15.060 --> 1:22:16.409
You want to play?

1:22:16.453 --> 1:22:19.978
BANKS: I'm dying, Zeke,
end it now.

1:22:20.022 --> 1:22:21.675
In this corridor.

1:22:21.719 --> 1:22:23.590
OFFICER 2: Roger that.
Southwest entrance.

1:22:25.027 --> 1:22:26.202
OFFICER 1:
Going through the south door.

1:22:28.465 --> 1:22:30.206
Nothing here. Keep moving.

1:22:30.249 --> 1:22:31.859
SCHENK: I need you all in.

1:22:31.903 --> 1:22:33.383
Dunleavy ruined both our lives

1:22:33.426 --> 1:22:35.167
and you tried to help
that piece of shit?

1:22:35.211 --> 1:22:37.517
-Zeke!
-Pete!

1:22:37.561 --> 1:22:39.389
You failed that test.

1:22:39.432 --> 1:22:41.521
Now I need you to choose
who you're really with.

1:22:41.565 --> 1:22:43.436
The man
who corrupted the force,

1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:45.482
or the one
who's trying to save it.

1:22:45.525 --> 1:22:46.613
You want to tell him, Chief?

1:22:49.138 --> 1:22:51.009
Tell me what?

1:22:51.053 --> 1:22:53.751
Tell him about all the fucking
shit you did under Article 8.

1:22:54.795 --> 1:22:56.232
What's he talking about?

1:22:56.275 --> 1:22:57.973
-Time's running out.
-What's he talking about?

1:22:58.016 --> 1:23:01.106
Citizens were dying.

1:23:01.150 --> 1:23:04.980
We did what we had to
to clean up the streets.

1:23:05.023 --> 1:23:06.807
PETE: It was crazy
back then, right?

1:23:06.851 --> 1:23:08.853
We were working
under Article 8,

1:23:08.896 --> 1:23:10.072
we were out of control.

1:23:12.161 --> 1:23:14.163
Murder rate went way down.

1:23:14.206 --> 1:23:16.295
That's fucking bullshit.

1:23:16.339 --> 1:23:18.036
People felt safe again.

1:23:18.080 --> 1:23:20.647
The streets got cleaner
because the cops got dirtier.

1:23:20.691 --> 1:23:22.475
Your dad oversaw
the whole thing, by the way.

1:23:22.519 --> 1:23:25.391
Innocent people getting shot,
all in the name of justice.

1:23:25.435 --> 1:23:26.827
Article 8 was
one of the most corrupt

1:23:26.871 --> 1:23:28.699
police policies in history,

1:23:28.742 --> 1:23:30.353
and guess who was
your dad's right-hand man?

1:23:30.396 --> 1:23:32.224
Sorry, or should I say woman,
the whole time?

1:23:32.268 --> 1:23:35.314
We'll handle it.
We always do, huh?

1:23:35.358 --> 1:23:36.402
Angie?

1:23:36.446 --> 1:23:37.577
Angie!

1:23:37.621 --> 1:23:39.101
It was Angie.

1:23:39.144 --> 1:23:40.450
I mean,
not a massive surprise.

1:23:40.493 --> 1:23:42.321
You think it was
her stellar reputation

1:23:42.365 --> 1:23:44.236
that got her a precinct
at age 35? Come on.

1:23:44.280 --> 1:23:47.283
Shoot this piece of shit,
Ezekiel. Now.

1:23:47.326 --> 1:23:49.067
SCHENK: Yeah, that's right,
because that's what cops do.

1:23:49.111 --> 1:23:50.286
Shoot first,
ask questions later.

1:23:53.767 --> 1:23:57.032
You watched my father die
and I'm trying to save yours.

1:23:57.075 --> 1:23:58.859
If we're going to trust
each other,

1:23:58.903 --> 1:23:59.904
I need you to do this.

1:24:01.297 --> 1:24:02.820
BANKS: Ezekiel...

1:24:02.863 --> 1:24:06.867
You've always done
the right thing, do it now.

1:24:06.911 --> 1:24:08.608
This piece of shit
is killing cops.

1:24:10.306 --> 1:24:12.134
SCHENK:
You still need to decide,

1:24:12.177 --> 1:24:15.789
you can shoot me, or...

1:24:15.833 --> 1:24:16.921
Or you can save your dad.

1:24:18.749 --> 1:24:20.359
Clock's ticking, man.

1:24:20.403 --> 1:24:21.578
Think fast.

1:24:22.448 --> 1:24:24.102
Cavalry's coming.

1:24:24.146 --> 1:24:26.278
But not in time to do
any favors for your old man.

1:24:26.322 --> 1:24:27.540
Only you can do that.

1:24:35.896 --> 1:24:37.072
Dad? Dad?

1:24:38.334 --> 1:24:39.335
OFFICER: Shots fired!

1:24:49.171 --> 1:24:50.476
Zeke... Zeke.

1:24:51.695 --> 1:24:52.739
ZEKE: It's going to be okay.

1:24:52.783 --> 1:24:56.003
He's getting away.

1:24:56.047 --> 1:24:58.093
Don't let him get away.

1:24:58.658 --> 1:25:00.791
Go... Go!

1:25:18.548 --> 1:25:20.941
Stop. Don't come in.

1:25:20.985 --> 1:25:22.029
Don't come in.

1:25:36.957 --> 1:25:37.958
Oh, God.

1:25:39.786 --> 1:25:42.789
Whoever did this has another
motive, something personal.

1:25:42.833 --> 1:25:44.095
Whoever did this...

1:25:46.837 --> 1:25:47.925
...they're pulling
all the strings.

1:25:51.624 --> 1:25:53.757
Your dad is the reason
for all of this.

1:25:53.800 --> 1:25:55.541
He's why I wanted to do this
in the first place.

1:25:55.585 --> 1:25:57.456
I've been dreaming about this
since I was 12 years old.

1:26:04.376 --> 1:26:06.291
What the fuck is going on?

1:26:10.252 --> 1:26:12.993
-OFFICER 1: Go, go, go!
-

1:26:13.037 --> 1:26:14.517
Get down! Get down now!

1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:15.605
OFFICER 2:
Let me see your hands!

1:26:16.475 --> 1:26:17.650
No! No, no, stop!

1:26:17.694 --> 1:26:18.956
No! God!

1:26:18.999 --> 1:26:20.523
OFFICER 2: Freeze!
ZEKE: No, no!

1:26:23.917 --> 1:26:24.962
No!

1:26:25.005 --> 1:26:26.181
OFFICER: Put it down!

1:26:27.530 --> 1:26:29.009
Lower your weapon!

1:26:29.053 --> 1:26:30.054
Fire!

1:26:52.946 --> 1:26:55.906
No!
