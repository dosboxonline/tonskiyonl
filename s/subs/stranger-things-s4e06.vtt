[horrific musical stinger plays]

00:55.055 --> 00:57.432
[Powell] Where was Eddie
when that happened?

00:57.515 --> 00:59.100
[inhales deeply] Wha…

00:59.934 --> 01:01.102
Wait, what?

01:01.186 --> 01:02.145
Eddie.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.939
Where was Eddie when you saw this?

01:05.023 --> 01:07.609
-He… He was in the…
-[tense music playing]

01:07.692 --> 01:09.277
…in the boat, like I said.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.236
[Powell] Right.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.697
[officer] Right. Right.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.658
But then, uh… [clicks tongue]

01:15.742 --> 01:18.536
…who lifted Patrick out the water?

01:21.623 --> 01:22.582
What…

01:24.084 --> 01:25.460
You're not listening to me.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.506
-Why aren't you listening to me?
-Jason, we are listening.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.925
No, you're not. You're not.

01:32.008 --> 01:33.051
Eddie, he's…

01:34.385 --> 01:35.345
Eddie is a vessel.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.180
Just a vessel.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.181
A vessel?

01:38.264 --> 01:39.140
For Satan.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.977
He's made a pact with the devil.
Now he has his powers.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.522
[tense music continues]

01:49.609 --> 01:50.777
You don't believe me.

01:51.361 --> 01:52.529
We're just, uh,

01:53.530 --> 01:55.615
processing all of this, that's all. Okay?

01:56.157 --> 01:56.991
[Callahan] Yeah.

02:05.208 --> 02:09.003
How do you expect to stop the devil
if you don't believe he's real?

04:30.937 --> 04:31.980
Where's the girl?

04:33.690 --> 04:34.816
[weakly] I told you.

04:36.901 --> 04:37.777
I don't…

04:38.361 --> 04:39.654
I don't… I don't know.

04:40.780 --> 04:43.491
There are two proposed explanations
for what is happening.

04:44.492 --> 04:45.952
Explanation one,

04:46.035 --> 04:49.497
an invisible boogeyman
from another dimension

04:49.580 --> 04:51.291
is slaughtering these kids.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.918
Explanation two,

04:54.002 --> 04:56.629
Dr. Brenner's special little pet
has gone rogue again

04:56.713 --> 04:58.673
and he and his lackeys

04:58.756 --> 05:00.758
are now seeking to cover it up.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.305
Perhaps in the hopes
of selling their pet to the Soviets.

05:07.181 --> 05:08.016
Now,

05:09.642 --> 05:12.603
which explanation sounds plausible to you?

05:12.687 --> 05:13.688
Hmm?

05:15.982 --> 05:17.025
[sobs] I don't know.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.737
There's still a chance
to redeem yourself, Mr. Wallace.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.408
Where is she?

05:29.078 --> 05:30.997
[suspenseful audio distortion]

05:36.419 --> 05:38.379
No! [Wallace struggling]

05:38.463 --> 05:40.423
No! No!

05:40.506 --> 05:42.675
[grunting]

05:42.759 --> 05:43.885
No!

05:43.968 --> 05:45.970
[door slam echoes]

05:55.438 --> 05:57.398
[exhales]

05:58.524 --> 06:00.860
[Brenner] Do you know what happens
when someone has a stroke?

06:02.695 --> 06:05.114
The blood supply to the brain is cut off.

06:05.740 --> 06:09.160
It scrambles the signals in the brain
to the point where the mind

06:09.243 --> 06:10.953
can forget how to do things.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.664
To eat. To speak.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.041
To walk.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.918
When you were attacked last year,

06:17.001 --> 06:20.171
I believe that your signals
were scrambled in much the same way.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.631
[mysterious music playing]

06:21.714 --> 06:25.093
But just as a stroke victim
can learn to walk again,

06:25.176 --> 06:28.304
I believe you, too,
can return to your full power.

06:31.349 --> 06:34.727
Your abilities are still in here.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.896
You just need to remember.

06:38.356 --> 06:40.358
[beeping]

06:42.110 --> 06:44.195
Everything that took place in my lab

06:44.278 --> 06:46.114
was captured on videotape.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.743
Every success and every failure.

06:51.911 --> 06:55.581
It's important for you
to not just see your past,

06:55.665 --> 06:58.626
but to fully re-experience it.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.421
In doing so, I believe we can

07:01.504 --> 07:03.297
repair your broken signals.

07:04.715 --> 07:08.052
As we saw tonight,
that process has already begun.

07:08.136 --> 07:09.303
[player whirring]

07:14.934 --> 07:16.602
If this all happened,

07:17.895 --> 07:19.230
why don't I remember?

07:19.814 --> 07:21.649
Because you do not want to.

07:23.067 --> 07:27.029
Our brains have
a defense mechanism in place

07:27.113 --> 07:30.032
to protect it from bad memories.

07:30.783 --> 07:31.993
From trauma.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.371
You buried these memories long ago.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.084
[Eleven] Papa.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.880
When I was in there,

07:45.465 --> 07:46.591
I saw something.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.259
[eerie distorted audio]

07:48.342 --> 07:49.760
There was blood.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.971
[sinister music playing]

07:52.054 --> 07:53.181
So much blood.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.767
That was another memory,

07:56.851 --> 07:59.020
a… a more powerful one,

07:59.687 --> 08:01.355
invading from your subconscious.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.358
You have demons, Eleven.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.111
You have demons in your past.

08:08.446 --> 08:11.073
That is why we must proceed carefully.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.243
One step at a time,

08:14.785 --> 08:16.829
one memory at a time.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.790
-[mysterious music playing]
-If we go too fast,

08:19.874 --> 08:22.627
I'm afraid you could
become lost in the darkness.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.670
[tank door whirring]

08:28.257 --> 08:29.592
And if you are lost…

08:32.970 --> 08:34.138
so are we all.

[worker] Oh.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.041
Hey, Eric. I'm taking five.

09:02.708 --> 09:03.751
You just took five.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.921
Yeah, well, tell Milo
to take it easy on the onions next time.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.089
[laughs]

09:24.272 --> 09:26.941
[upbeat music plays on radio]

09:27.024 --> 09:29.026
[Robin] Not to be a wimp,
but can I sit in the car?

09:29.110 --> 09:31.779
'Cause this is gonna
totally and royally suck.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.114
It'll be fine.

09:33.197 --> 09:36.242
I can't stand to see
those dull eyes of Eddie's break again.

09:36.325 --> 09:37.702
I really, really can't.

09:37.785 --> 09:40.121
At least he can drink himself
into feeling better.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.414
That's what my mom does.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.040
[Robin] Why don't we give it a trial?

09:43.124 --> 09:45.793
"Hey, Eddie.
Uh, good news first this time."

09:45.876 --> 09:49.130
"We got you some Dustin-approved junk food
and that six-pack you requested."

09:49.213 --> 09:50.840
"Oh yeah, and we found Vecna."

09:50.923 --> 09:54.927
"Bad news is that he's in that other,
darker, much scarier dimension,

09:55.011 --> 09:57.305
and the gate's closed,
so we have no way of getting to him."

09:57.388 --> 10:00.349
"He's entirely shut off to us,
so basically you're screwed."

10:00.433 --> 10:02.560
"And, no, I know
you were already screwed,

10:02.643 --> 10:05.313
but now you're doubly, triply screwed."

10:05.396 --> 10:07.315
Wait. Maybe we don't put it like that.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.775
"We're one step closer to finding Vecna."

10:09.859 --> 10:11.861
That's what we say.
That's what's important.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.780
See, Robin? Positive spin
can make all the difference.

10:14.864 --> 10:15.698
Uh-huh.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.408
Oh shit.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.827
[tense music playing]

10:26.709 --> 10:27.710
[Powell] Nothing to see.

-Just step back a little.
-[crowd clamoring]

10:32.214 --> 10:33.215
All right?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.009
-This way.
-[Powell] As many of you know,

10:35.092 --> 10:37.887
the Roane County line received a call

-a little after midnight…
-[indistinct chatter]

10:40.431 --> 10:42.391
…reporting a homicide here on the lake.

10:43.142 --> 10:45.561
Officer Callahan here and myself

10:45.645 --> 10:48.022
arrived first on the scene.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.691
We made our way
to the shore of Lover's Lake,

10:50.775 --> 10:53.778
about ten yards from that house
you see behind me.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.947
It was there that we found the victim,

10:57.490 --> 11:00.409
an 18-year-old senior from Hawkins High,

11:01.077 --> 11:02.078
Patrick McKinney.

11:02.870 --> 11:04.705
His limbs…

11:04.789 --> 11:06.374
-Oh my God.
-…his body, it was disfigured…

11:06.457 --> 11:09.877
What are we even doing?
I mean, where is the FBI?

11:09.960 --> 11:13.464
-There was an eyewitness on the scene…
-That's what I want to know.

11:13.547 --> 11:15.383
We got a serial killer on the loose.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.636
We have also identified
a person of interest.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.971
Eddie Munson.

11:21.055 --> 11:23.265
We encourage anyone with information

-Oh man.

-[reporters clamoring]
-This is not good. Really not good.

11:28.104 --> 11:31.732
[Powell] You've got a lot of questions,
and I'm going to answer as many as I can.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.901
Two o'clock at town hall,

11:33.984 --> 11:37.363
where anyone from the Hawkins community
is welcome. But right now,

11:37.446 --> 11:40.282
I've got work to do,
and I appreciate your understanding.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.451
[reporter] Is Eddie still in Hawkins?

11:42.535 --> 11:45.037

Dustin, can you hear me? Wheeler?

[tense music playing]

11:46.706 --> 11:47.748
Eddie. Holy shit.

11:47.832 --> 11:48.791
Are you okay?

11:50.084 --> 11:53.087
Nah, man.
Pretty… Pretty goddamn far from okay.

11:53.170 --> 11:54.839
-Where is he?
-Where are you?

11:54.922 --> 11:57.133
-Skull Rock. Do you know it?
-Uh, yeah.

11:57.216 --> 12:00.845
-That's near Cornwallis and--
-Garrett, yeah. I know where that is.

Can't feel my butt.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.037
Can you guys feel your butts?

12:27.121 --> 12:28.456
[Will] I can feel my butt.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.417
Everyone needs to be
on their best behavior, okay?

12:31.500 --> 12:33.502
[Argyle] Why are you looking at me
when you say that?

12:33.586 --> 12:35.921
-[Jonathan] I didn't.
-[Mike] They're just really religious.

12:36.005 --> 12:38.007
Yeah, and I'm super spiritual, dude.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.635
Yeah, I think they're spiritual too.
Just in a different way.

[classical music playing]

12:46.640 --> 12:48.642

You elf-skin! You dried neat's tongue!

13:07.495 --> 13:09.872
This is my kind of party.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.207
I've been bitten.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.375
Help! Help!

13:13.459 --> 13:15.836
-Beautiful performance.
-[Jonathan] Excuse me.

Uh, hey, we're looking for Suzie.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.048
[snaps angrily]

13:19.131 --> 13:21.926
[emphatically] Can you not see

13:22.009 --> 13:23.803
that we are filming?

13:25.137 --> 13:26.180
[director] Come on.

13:26.680 --> 13:30.267
All right, stay in it, Tabitha.
Stay in it.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.605
Hi, we're looking for Suzie.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.398
Don't know, don't care.

13:36.482 --> 13:40.528
That's too much salt, Peter.

How many times do I have to tell you?

That is not a toy.

-[Cornelius grunts]
-Come on.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.045

You make sure to give that selfish
four-eyed shit a nice little shove for me.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.449
[spluttering] Absolutely.

14:28.075 --> 14:28.909
Eden, I…

14:30.160 --> 14:32.580
I will shove her for you. I will…

14:33.163 --> 14:34.874
I will do anything for you.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.586
[sighs] Well, great, she's not here.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.004
[window creaking]

14:41.463 --> 14:42.631
[clattering]

14:42.715 --> 14:43.799
"Give her a shove."

14:46.093 --> 14:47.469
-[Mike] Suzie!
-Yeah?

14:48.387 --> 14:50.139
Who the heck are you?

14:50.222 --> 14:52.099
And what are you doing in my room?

14:52.182 --> 14:54.435
-Sorry, that's… that's fair.
-No, listen.

14:54.518 --> 14:56.270
-We're Dustin's friends.
-[Mike] Yeah.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.897
We really need your help.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.733
[brave, plucky classical music playing]

15:02.484 --> 15:03.485
[music fades]

15:03.569 --> 15:05.571
[wind whistling]

15:09.700 --> 15:10.701
[Murray shivering]

15:17.958 --> 15:19.335
You said an hour.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.753
[Murray] I underestimated.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.255
[Joyce] I thought you were dead.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.757
Might as well be.

15:24.840 --> 15:28.218
We are truly in hell if hell froze over.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.346
[Murray panting]

15:30.846 --> 15:34.308
There's nothing south,
but two miles north I saw some smoke.

15:34.391 --> 15:35.768
Could be a town, a house.

15:35.851 --> 15:38.687
Maybe somebody there knows
where we can find this prison.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.773
The top-secret prison.

15:40.856 --> 15:41.857
Really?

15:41.941 --> 15:42.858
Right.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.445
[panting] Any luck with our friend?

15:46.528 --> 15:47.947
What do you think?

15:48.030 --> 15:49.573
[Murray chuckles]

15:53.577 --> 15:54.453
Hey!

15:55.079 --> 15:56.330
Dipshit!

16:02.378 --> 16:04.213
We're outta here. Last chance.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.840
-Where's the prison?
-[Joyce sighs]

16:06.924 --> 16:08.050
I told you.

16:08.133 --> 16:10.386
Yuri will help you for the right price.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.471
I told you, we're wasting our time.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.557
-Half.
-What?

16:15.641 --> 16:18.310
-What?
-You heard me, you stubborn bastard.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.478
Half the reward.

16:19.561 --> 16:20.813
Twenty thousand.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.856
-Thirty thousand.
-Twenty-two.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.024
Twenty-five.

16:26.110 --> 16:26.944
All right.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.404
[Yuri laughs]

16:28.487 --> 16:31.407
Looks like we got ourselves

16:31.490 --> 16:33.534
a moron!

16:33.617 --> 16:34.743
[Murray laughs]

16:34.827 --> 16:36.662
You thought I was serious?

16:36.745 --> 16:38.831
He thought I was serious.

16:38.914 --> 16:41.041
[imitating Yuri] I got you!
I got you good!

16:41.125 --> 16:42.584
[laughing]

16:43.293 --> 16:46.046
There's only one thing you get
if you take this deal.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.007
You get to live.

16:48.090 --> 16:49.967
You are not killer.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.385
Oh, you're right.

16:51.468 --> 16:52.386
He's not a killer.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.429
No.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.431
Thing is, we don't need to kill you.

16:55.514 --> 16:57.433
We can just leave you here.

16:57.516 --> 17:00.686
Because there's nothing for miles

17:00.769 --> 17:03.814
-and no one will find you.
-[ominous music playing]

17:03.897 --> 17:05.190
[Murray] No human, at least.

17:05.274 --> 17:07.860
-I saw tracks.
-Tracks.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.737
[Murray] In the woods, Yuri.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.698
-Bears.
-Bears.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.075
Who knew you could see your own future?

17:15.659 --> 17:17.870
Shall we fly out of here, little bird?

17:17.953 --> 17:20.622
Uh, da, da.

17:21.290 --> 17:22.499
Bye-bye, Yuri.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.501
[Murray laughing]

17:30.674 --> 17:31.508
Wait.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.971
You should go east, not north.

17:36.513 --> 17:40.225
My warehouse is there.
Supplies, guns, truck.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.853
We will need to reach prison by nightfall

17:42.936 --> 17:44.938
if you hope to save your friend.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.775
That is, if he's not already dead.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.109
[dramatic music playing]

17:49.193 --> 17:51.195
[Yuri laughs]

17:53.030 --> 17:54.406
[lock clicks]

17:54.490 --> 17:55.365
[in Russian] Out.

17:55.449 --> 17:56.617
Everyone out.

17:57.367 --> 17:59.620
-[gun cocks]
-Let's go! Move it!

18:13.509 --> 18:15.344
[in English] This is it, American.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.762
I hope you're ready.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.486
[in Russian] What are you all waiting for?

18:32.569 --> 18:33.570
Move!

18:34.613 --> 18:36.031
Let's go!

18:36.740 --> 18:38.075
Move!

18:39.201 --> 18:41.537
[grandiose Russian opera playing]

19:12.067 --> 19:13.944
[in English] Am I dreaming, American?

19:14.820 --> 19:18.407
Or is this real? [laughing]

19:23.745 --> 19:25.122
[lips smacking wetly]

19:32.629 --> 19:35.299
[in Russian] What is wrong
with your American friend?

19:36.800 --> 19:39.595
He has lost his spirit to live.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.139
-[chuckles]
-And he is not my friend.

19:43.098 --> 19:45.475
[in English] Isn't that right, Cursed One?

19:45.976 --> 19:47.978
You have lost your spirit to live.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.272
Yeah. Yeah, something like that.

19:50.856 --> 19:52.774
[cup clatters loudly]

19:52.858 --> 19:53.901
No…

19:53.984 --> 19:56.111
[Hopper clatters]

19:56.195 --> 19:57.863
[laughing]

19:57.946 --> 19:59.907
[Antonov in Russian]
He is American after all.

19:59.990 --> 20:03.660
Big talk, but weak inside.

20:04.661 --> 20:06.079
Tell him to eat.

20:07.414 --> 20:09.416
Or he endangers us all.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.378
We have a big fight ahead of us.

20:13.962 --> 20:15.130
What are you talking about? Fight?

20:15.964 --> 20:19.134
I have been in this place one week.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.886
[ominous music playing]

20:20.969 --> 20:22.596
My first night,

20:22.679 --> 20:24.598
I saw six men enter this room.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.433
Six.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.101
Just like us.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.728
They came out

20:29.811 --> 20:34.358
happy and fat, faces smothered in grease.

20:34.441 --> 20:35.817
[ominous music continues]

20:35.901 --> 20:38.987
But when night fell,
they were thrown into that pit out there.

20:39.613 --> 20:40.739
But not alone.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.825
You heard those roars, yes?

20:46.954 --> 20:48.038
That is a monster.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.749
-Not from this world.
-[intense stinger plays]

20:50.832 --> 20:53.710
[Hopper grunting]

20:54.836 --> 20:58.090
Thirty seconds it took! Thirty seconds...

20:58.173 --> 20:59.883
And all six men…

21:00.425 --> 21:01.885
You speak no sense.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.638
If they plan to kill us tonight,
why waste this food on us?

21:04.721 --> 21:06.390
They want us strong.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.558
So we can fight it.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.852
To test its strength.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.105
To train this monster for war.

21:13.188 --> 21:16.566
But last week, the men got their weapons...

21:16.650 --> 21:19.611
then scattered like fools.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.905
We stick together...

21:22.489 --> 21:23.782
Perhaps we stand a chance!

21:24.366 --> 21:26.410
Perhaps we live to see another day.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.872
[all] Till tomorrow!

21:30.956 --> 21:32.040
[music builds to climax]

21:32.124 --> 21:33.458
[in English] Let me guess.

21:34.918 --> 21:35.919
This…

21:38.547 --> 21:40.340
…it's about nine feet tall?

21:41.091 --> 21:42.426
Thin, white skin?

21:43.093 --> 21:44.136
No face?

21:45.762 --> 21:46.847
No eyes?

21:47.931 --> 21:50.309
[in Russian]
Come on, come on, come on. Translate!

21:50.892 --> 21:54.980
[translates into Russian]

21:55.063 --> 21:57.065
[eerie, foreboding music playing]

22:02.321 --> 22:04.156
How do you know this?

22:05.073 --> 22:06.450
[in English] 'Cause I've seen one.

22:06.533 --> 22:07.367
[Antonov translates]

22:07.451 --> 22:08.493
And I've fought one.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.453
[Antonov translates]

22:09.536 --> 22:11.371
And all your theories about it,

22:12.956 --> 22:14.041
they're all wrong.

22:14.124 --> 22:16.251
[Antonov translates]

22:16.335 --> 22:19.212
You know why they feed
captive predators live prey?

22:19.296 --> 22:20.380
[Antonov translates]

22:20.464 --> 22:24.676
Because if they don't, the predator
gets bored and it stops eating.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.345
[Antonov translates]

22:26.428 --> 22:28.472
It needs the thrill of the hunt.

22:28.555 --> 22:29.973
[Antonov translates]

22:31.808 --> 22:37.022
We're not here to train this monster
with swords and axes.

22:37.105 --> 22:38.231
[Antonov translates]

22:38.315 --> 22:39.941
We're here to entertain it.

22:40.025 --> 22:41.234
[Antonov translates]

22:41.818 --> 22:42.944
And this food…

22:45.614 --> 22:47.741
this food isn't to make us strong.

22:47.824 --> 22:51.161
It's to, uh, make us plump.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.205
[clattering]

22:53.914 --> 22:58.251
So we're full of the nutrients and protein
that a growing monster might need.

22:58.335 --> 23:02.506
[translates into Russian]

23:03.673 --> 23:04.925
[Hopper] So eat up, boys.

23:05.717 --> 23:06.635
Enjoy.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.513
This is your last meal.

23:10.180 --> 23:14.017
[translates into Russian]

23:19.106 --> 23:21.024
[ominous music swells]

[chip clattering]

23:42.045 --> 23:42.963
[frustrated grunt]

23:43.046 --> 23:44.756
Which number are you aiming for?

23:49.261 --> 23:50.220
Three.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.060
You know,

23:58.603 --> 23:59.688
sometimes

24:01.106 --> 24:03.358
it's helpful to take a step away
for a moment.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.735
Let the mind clear.

24:08.697 --> 24:09.531
[sighs]

24:12.826 --> 24:15.454
[chip clattering]

24:19.749 --> 24:21.084
[orderly] Determined, aren't we?

24:21.626 --> 24:23.336
-You know…
-[sighs]

24:23.420 --> 24:27.048
…you remind me of someone.
Someone I used to know really well.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.509
Can you guess who that is?

24:39.644 --> 24:40.854
One?

24:43.398 --> 24:45.609
-Papa said that he doesn't--
-Exist? I know.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.570
[camera whirring]

24:50.655 --> 24:52.616
[whispers] But can I tell you a secret?

24:52.699 --> 24:53.950
Sometimes,

24:55.160 --> 24:56.745
Papa doesn't tell the truth.

24:56.828 --> 24:58.246
[eerie music playing]

24:58.330 --> 25:00.123
I spent years with One.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.250
Right here.

25:03.418 --> 25:04.794
In this very room.

25:04.878 --> 25:05.921
Where is he?

25:07.172 --> 25:09.466
Maybe we'll save that story
for another day.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.094
It doesn't have a happy ending,
I'm afraid.

25:14.012 --> 25:15.555
But he was a lot like you.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.641
Everything was hard for him.

25:17.724 --> 25:21.228
Then, out of nowhere,
he walked in here and it was like

25:21.978 --> 25:23.355
something had changed.

25:24.773 --> 25:27.150
And I asked him what's different,
and he said…

25:29.986 --> 25:32.948
he said he had figured it out.

25:33.490 --> 25:36.576
He had found his strength
in a memory from his past.

25:38.036 --> 25:39.871
Something that made him sad.

25:41.373 --> 25:42.666
But also angry.

25:44.042 --> 25:44.918
Do you

25:45.544 --> 25:47.337
maybe have a memory like that?

25:50.799 --> 25:54.135
Do you remember the day
a strange woman came to see you?

25:55.929 --> 25:58.139
This would've been
when Eight was still here.

25:58.640 --> 25:59.558
[children laugh]

26:01.476 --> 26:02.769
The woman,

26:04.396 --> 26:06.231
she was calling a name to you.

26:06.856 --> 26:09.150
[muffled] Jane. No! No!

26:09.234 --> 26:10.777
No! Jane!

26:11.653 --> 26:12.654
That

26:13.697 --> 26:14.948
was your mother.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.534
[breathes shakily]

26:17.617 --> 26:18.952
Mama is dead.

26:19.035 --> 26:20.870
She died making me.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.080
And who told you that?

26:22.163 --> 26:23.164
Papa.

26:27.752 --> 26:29.838
Who doesn't always tell the truth.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.425
This place…

26:35.427 --> 26:36.761
and the people here…

26:39.139 --> 26:40.849
are not what you think.

26:42.726 --> 26:43.643
[door opens]

26:43.727 --> 26:47.981
-Good morning, children.
-[children] Good morning, Papa.

26:48.815 --> 26:52.027
I've got something very special
planned for you today.

26:52.861 --> 26:53.778
Are you ready?

26:53.862 --> 26:55.572
Yes, Papa.

26:55.655 --> 26:56.865
Good.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.950
Seventeen, would you open the door?

26:59.034 --> 27:00.785
-Yes, Papa.
-Off you go.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.871
[tense music playing]

27:09.878 --> 27:10.795
After you.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.178
[machinery whirring]

27:24.100 --> 27:26.311
We should've just told her the truth.

27:26.394 --> 27:27.687
And risk everything?

27:28.521 --> 27:29.481
No.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.192
She'll find out soon enough.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.382
[Steve] Dude, I'm telling you,
you're taking us the wrong way.

27:55.465 --> 27:57.717
It's north. I'm positive.
I checked the map.

27:57.801 --> 28:00.428
You do realize Skull Rock,
it's a super popular make-out spot?

28:00.512 --> 28:01.429
Yeah. So?

28:01.513 --> 28:04.307
Yeah, well, it wasn't popular
until I made it popular.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.101
All right? I practically invented it.

28:06.184 --> 28:08.436
-We're heading in the wrong direction.
-Steve.

28:08.978 --> 28:12.524
-Where are you going? Steve!
-Stop whining. Let's go. Trust me.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.361
[Max] Okay, so apparently
we're going this way now?

28:16.444 --> 28:18.613
I swear to God, if they get us lost…

28:21.991 --> 28:22.909
Hey.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.536
You okay?

28:24.619 --> 28:25.662
Uh, yeah.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.748
I'm fine. Just…

28:29.666 --> 28:31.668
thinking about Patrick. You know?

28:32.377 --> 28:33.253
Yeah.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.922
I mean, it's… it's like,

28:36.631 --> 28:38.299
why him?

28:39.342 --> 28:41.845
But then, I remember this one day,

28:41.928 --> 28:44.013
he… he came to practice with a black eye.

28:44.514 --> 28:47.517
He said he fell, but clearly he was lying.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.647
It's like everyone Vecna targets

28:52.731 --> 28:54.733
has something in their life.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.445
-Something that's--
-Hurting them.

29:00.947 --> 29:01.865
Haunting them.

29:01.948 --> 29:02.949
[eerie music playing]

29:03.032 --> 29:03.950
Yeah.

29:05.326 --> 29:07.454
I… I didn't really know Patrick,

29:07.537 --> 29:10.081
so it was easy to just

29:10.790 --> 29:12.792
look the other way, I guess.

29:14.669 --> 29:16.337
But I did know you.

29:18.631 --> 29:21.384
And I'm sorry I wasn't there.

29:21.926 --> 29:22.844
It's not your fault.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.013
-No.
-I disappeared.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.848
No, no, you didn't.

29:27.640 --> 29:29.476
I just didn't look hard enough.

29:30.351 --> 29:31.478
Okay?

29:32.103 --> 29:33.480
But I see you now.

29:34.814 --> 29:35.857
I see you.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.362
[scoffs]

29:41.446 --> 29:45.158
Oh my God, they're so adorable.
I just wanna squeeze 'em, you know?

29:45.742 --> 29:49.996
If I'm permitted to see a silver lining
in this end-of-the-world doom and gloom,

29:50.079 --> 29:54.876
it would be the rekindling of old flames
that never should've been snuffed out.

29:55.835 --> 29:58.379
I didn't mean that as a hint or anything.

29:58.463 --> 29:59.464
Right.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.510
But if I did mean it as a hint,
would that be so terrible?

30:03.593 --> 30:05.470
To wish for happiness for my friends?

30:05.553 --> 30:07.597
[scoffs] You think I'm not happy?

30:07.680 --> 30:08.681
I… I'm sure you are.

30:08.765 --> 30:10.850
It's just, the other day,
I mentioned Jonathan

30:10.934 --> 30:13.186
and you flinched
or winced or something like--

30:13.269 --> 30:15.396
I didn't flinch or wince.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.315
-Okay.
-Jonathan and I are fine.

30:17.398 --> 30:18.358
-Got it.
-We're good.

30:18.441 --> 30:19.818
Right.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.111
It's just…

30:23.947 --> 30:24.781
[Nancy sighs]

30:24.864 --> 30:26.115
[emotional music playing]

30:26.199 --> 30:28.368
He was supposed to be here for the break,

30:28.451 --> 30:33.790
and then he backed out at the last minute
for some vague, mumbly Jonathan reason.

30:33.873 --> 30:36.084
And, to be honest, I'm not that surprised

30:36.167 --> 30:38.294
because I've been
feeling him pulling away.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.130
And I don't know
if it's because we're 2,000 miles away

30:41.214 --> 30:43.550
or if he met someone new or what.

30:43.633 --> 30:45.343
And now I can't find out why

30:45.426 --> 30:48.638
because apparently he's blown up
his family's house phone or something.

30:48.721 --> 30:53.518
So, yeah, if… if the mention of his name
caused a slight muscle spasm on my face,

30:53.601 --> 30:56.312
that's… probably why.

30:57.230 --> 31:01.359
Seems like a perfectly reasonable reason
to flinch, wince, or something.

31:03.778 --> 31:07.824
You said, "the happiness of your friends."

31:07.907 --> 31:10.660
So does that make us friends?

31:10.743 --> 31:12.537
As in, officially?

31:12.620 --> 31:15.456
Uh, yeah. I… I mean, right?

31:16.291 --> 31:17.208
Right.

31:19.586 --> 31:20.670
[Steve] Oh, boom!

31:20.753 --> 31:23.089
Bada bing, bada boom.
There she is, Henderson.

31:23.172 --> 31:24.382
Skull Rock.

31:24.465 --> 31:27.343
In your face, man.
In your stupid, cocky little face.

31:28.511 --> 31:29.387
Doesn't make sense.

31:29.470 --> 31:32.098
Yeah, yeah. Even with it staring you
in the face, you can't admit it.

31:32.181 --> 31:34.183
Can't admit you're wrong, you butthead.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.185
[Eddie] I concur.

31:36.269 --> 31:38.479
You, Dustin Henderson, are a…

31:39.689 --> 31:41.149
total butthead.

31:41.232 --> 31:43.026
Jesus, we thought you were a goner.

31:44.319 --> 31:45.528
Yeah, me too, man.

31:46.446 --> 31:47.447
Me too.

31:51.868 --> 31:54.579
How long have you known
Eddie was killing these kids?

31:54.662 --> 31:56.664
It was his trailer
where Chrissy was killed,

31:56.748 --> 31:59.834
and you expect us to believe
he was made a suspect just this morning?

31:59.918 --> 32:03.129
The truth is we've been
following several leads,

32:03.212 --> 32:05.757
and, yes, Eddie Munson was one of them.

32:05.840 --> 32:09.636
And we are now doing everything
in our power to find him.

32:09.719 --> 32:10.803
[all clamoring]

32:10.887 --> 32:13.348
[Powell] In the meantime, for your safety,

32:13.431 --> 32:15.558
we will be enforcing a strict curfew.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.727
-What?
-That's your solution?

32:17.810 --> 32:20.688
-Hide from him?
-We're already doing that.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.523
It's been days. Days!

32:22.607 --> 32:25.151
So you tell me why
he's not behind bars right now.

32:25.234 --> 32:28.863
I understand you all are upset,
but I promise you,

32:28.947 --> 32:30.531
we will find him.

32:30.615 --> 32:31.658
[Jason] No.

32:32.158 --> 32:33.576
[crowd falls silent]

32:35.620 --> 32:36.454
You won't.

32:36.996 --> 32:37.956
Jason?

32:38.831 --> 32:40.917
Son, how about
we talk about this in private?

32:41.000 --> 32:43.670
Why? So you can keep me quiet?

32:43.753 --> 32:46.130
So you can keep the truth from coming out?

32:46.214 --> 32:47.966
I don't know about the rest of you,

32:48.049 --> 32:50.802
but I can't bear to listen
to any more excuses and lies.

32:50.885 --> 32:53.137
-That's enough.
-I agree, I've had enough!

32:53.221 --> 32:54.222
[scattered yelling]

32:54.305 --> 32:56.224
In fact, I think we've all had enough.

32:56.307 --> 32:57.225
[applause]

33:03.314 --> 33:05.984
[microphone feedback]

33:07.110 --> 33:08.111
Last night…

33:10.697 --> 33:12.198
[unsettling music playing]

33:14.242 --> 33:16.744
Last night, I saw things,
things I can't explain.

33:18.454 --> 33:22.291
Things the police don't wanna believe.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.045
And things that
I don't wanna believe myself.

33:26.129 --> 33:28.172
But I know what I saw. I know.

33:29.590 --> 33:31.968
And I've come to accept an awful truth.

33:33.302 --> 33:36.681
-These murders are ritualistic sacrifices.
-[crowd gasping]

33:36.764 --> 33:40.143
We've all heard how satanic cults
are spreading through our country

33:40.226 --> 33:41.769
like some… some disease.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.187
And Eddie Munson

33:44.022 --> 33:45.982
is the leader of one of these cults.

33:46.482 --> 33:48.484
A cult that operates here in Hawkins.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.279
The mall fire.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.531
All those unexplained deaths
over the years.

33:54.157 --> 33:57.326
Some people say our town is cursed.
They just don't know why.

33:57.410 --> 33:59.037
Now… Now we do.

33:59.662 --> 34:00.580
Now we know.

34:04.667 --> 34:05.877
They call themselves Hellfire.

34:05.960 --> 34:07.462
That's bullshit!

34:07.545 --> 34:10.840
The Hellfire isn't a cult.
It's a club for nerds.

34:10.923 --> 34:12.884
-[Mrs. Sinclair] Erica!
-Just the facts.

34:12.967 --> 34:13.801
[Jason] A club.

34:14.552 --> 34:17.930
A club. A harmless club.
That's what they want you to think.

34:18.681 --> 34:20.183
But it's a lie.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.185
A lie designed to conceal the truth.

34:22.268 --> 34:23.895
[breathes shakily]

34:24.562 --> 34:28.608
And now this cult
is protecting its leader, Eddie.

34:28.691 --> 34:29.776
Hiding him.

34:30.401 --> 34:33.071
Allowing him to… to continue his rampage.

34:33.654 --> 34:37.283
Last night, I became overcome
with this feeling of… of hopelessness.

34:38.618 --> 34:40.953
Then I remembered Romans 12:21.

34:42.163 --> 34:43.873
"Do not be overcome by evil."

34:45.124 --> 34:47.043
"But overcome evil with good."

34:47.126 --> 34:49.504
And God knows there's good in this town.

34:49.587 --> 34:52.215
So much good. It's in this room!

34:52.298 --> 34:55.009
It's in this room, right here, right now.

34:55.551 --> 34:57.512
So I came here today, humbly,

34:58.054 --> 34:59.305
to ask for your help.

34:59.972 --> 35:01.349
To join me in this fight.

35:01.432 --> 35:05.353
Let us cast out this evil
and save Hawkins together.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.230
[crowd murmurs quietly]

35:07.313 --> 35:09.315
[crowd shifts uneasily]

35:25.414 --> 35:27.542
What are y'all just sitting around for?

35:27.625 --> 35:28.876
You heard the kid.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.962
[ominous music playing]

35:37.343 --> 35:38.219
[Powell] Hey.

35:39.262 --> 35:41.472
I want you all to hear me
loud and clear on this.

35:41.556 --> 35:45.059
Anyone interfering with this investigation

35:45.143 --> 35:46.811
will be arrested.

35:46.894 --> 35:50.022
Hey! Hey!
We will be implementing a curfew.

35:50.106 --> 35:54.610
If you are not in your house after sunset
with the doors locked,

35:54.694 --> 35:55.862
you'll be written up.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.698
And it's gonna go
on your permanent record.

36:05.037 --> 36:07.582
[Suzie] Okay, that is a lot to process.

36:08.291 --> 36:12.461
I mean, that might be seriously
the craziest thing I've ever heard.

36:12.545 --> 36:14.005
I know, it's hard to believe.

36:14.088 --> 36:15.506
But it's true. All true.

36:17.550 --> 36:20.553
I dial in to this computer
and find a location,

36:20.636 --> 36:23.347
and at this location is the Nina Project?

36:23.431 --> 36:24.348
Exactly.

36:24.432 --> 36:27.935
And the Nina Project
is the code name for a video game?

36:28.019 --> 36:30.897
No, it's not just a video game.
It's a video game console.

36:30.980 --> 36:33.399
It's basically America's answer
to Nintendo.

36:33.482 --> 36:34.984
Americantendo.

36:35.067 --> 36:36.152
That's a stupid name.

36:36.235 --> 36:40.406
You're right, it is a stupid name,
but, Suzie, it's 16-bit.

36:40.489 --> 36:41.741
Sixteen-bit?

36:42.325 --> 36:44.869
-Why have I never heard of it?
-Because it's top secret.

36:44.952 --> 36:48.289
-That's why we're doing this.
-Yeah, right. It's for the promotion.

36:48.372 --> 36:50.750
The first people to find
the secret location receive a--

36:50.833 --> 36:53.044
-Americantendo?
-Uh, an Americantendo.

36:53.127 --> 36:55.880
So you drove 3,000 miles
over your spring break

36:55.963 --> 36:58.216
so I can help you get
a new video game console

36:58.299 --> 36:59.383
no one has ever heard of?

36:59.467 --> 37:00.760
[all] Yes.

37:00.843 --> 37:01.677
[scoffs]

37:01.761 --> 37:04.472
-But it's not for us. It's for Dustin.
-Right.

37:04.555 --> 37:07.683
Exactly. It's for Dustin.
For Dustin's birthday, which is…

37:07.767 --> 37:09.477
In two months, three days, five hours.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.312
-[door opens]
-I don't know what you're doing,

37:11.395 --> 37:13.773
but I am not spending
my entire day babysitting.

37:13.856 --> 37:15.942
-Pull your damn weight.
-Language!

37:16.025 --> 37:18.069
Oh no, am I gonna burn in hell now?

37:18.152 --> 37:19.111
You tell her, Eden.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.906
-Out of my room.
-Don't touch me, you little shit!

37:21.989 --> 37:24.951
-[synth music playing]
-Okay, so can you help?

37:25.034 --> 37:27.286
I would do anything for Dustybun,

37:27.370 --> 37:30.957
but I'm afraid there's been
an unfortunate development.

37:31.040 --> 37:35.378
After changing Dusty's grade,
I was wracked with the most awful guilt.

37:35.461 --> 37:37.505
Suzie, I am incredibly disappointed.

37:37.588 --> 37:40.841
Father could see my soul was tortured,
and he wrenched a confession out of me.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.385
I wanted to help him.

37:42.468 --> 37:45.680
Not only was I breaking the law,
I was dating an agnostic.

37:46.264 --> 37:47.765
An agnostic!

37:47.848 --> 37:50.351
-I've never seen Father so angry.
-…starting today.

37:50.434 --> 37:51.477
He needed me.

37:51.560 --> 37:53.521
-Naturally…
-Father, no!

37:53.604 --> 37:55.690
…after learning the terrible truth,

37:55.773 --> 37:57.441
he confiscated my computer.

37:57.525 --> 37:59.986
And Father is not one to change his mind.

38:00.069 --> 38:03.072
I'm as likely to see it again
as I am my poor Dustybun.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.032
Where is it?

38:05.116 --> 38:06.033
His study.

38:06.617 --> 38:07.994
He uses it for work now.

38:08.077 --> 38:12.164
And Father's always working,
and his door is, like, permanently locked.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.083
-[Will scoffs]
-I'm really sorry.

38:14.583 --> 38:15.418
Truly.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.671
But it looks like you came
all the way here for nothing.

38:18.754 --> 38:20.881
-[breaker powering down]
-[Eden] Cornelius!

38:21.382 --> 38:23.050
-[Cornelius shrieks]
-[breaker powering up]

38:23.134 --> 38:23.968
[tense music playing]

38:24.051 --> 38:24.885
Unless…

38:25.928 --> 38:26.762
Unless?

38:26.846 --> 38:28.222
There might be a way.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.890
But we're gonna need help.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.059
And I mean a lot of help.

38:33.686 --> 38:34.854
All right.

38:35.479 --> 38:37.481
[tense music continues]

38:51.412 --> 38:52.955
Guys?

38:53.039 --> 38:54.123
Are you down here?

38:54.790 --> 38:55.708
Guys?

38:57.752 --> 39:00.129
[pants] They should've been back by now.

39:00.212 --> 39:01.339
They should be back.

39:01.422 --> 39:03.841
-What time was the movie?
-Uh, four hours ago.

39:03.924 --> 39:06.469
Hate to break it to you, Mrs. Wheeler,
but they lied to you.

39:06.552 --> 39:09.055
-♪ Liar, liar, pants on fire ♪
-Holly.

39:09.138 --> 39:12.183
We don't think they're actually involved
with Eddie, do we?

39:12.266 --> 39:14.852
I think at this point,
anything's possible.

39:14.935 --> 39:18.606
-Our children are not murderers, Ted.
-Don't put words in my mouth.

39:19.273 --> 39:21.317
See, she does that, twists my words.

39:21.400 --> 39:23.277
-You're calling the theater?
-[keypad beeping]

39:23.861 --> 39:25.488
-[inhales] The police.
-[line ringing]

39:29.241 --> 39:32.453
When I got to the shore,
I tried calling you guys, but, uh…

39:35.247 --> 39:37.083
my walkie was busted, man.

39:37.166 --> 39:38.125
Drenched.

39:38.209 --> 39:42.171
So, uh, I did the thing
that I do now, apparently.

39:42.838 --> 39:44.298
I ran. [chuckles]

39:44.382 --> 39:47.176
Do you know what time this was?
The attack?

39:47.259 --> 39:50.137
Yeah, no, I… I know
exactly what time it was.

39:50.221 --> 39:53.391
My walkie wasn't the only thing
that got soaked.

39:56.727 --> 39:58.896
-9:27.
-Same time our flashlights went kablooey.

39:58.979 --> 40:00.689
Which means what, exactly?

40:00.773 --> 40:04.568
That that surge of energy
was Vecna attacking Patrick.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.695
[Robin] Well, we're one step closer.

40:06.779 --> 40:08.531
We know how Vecna attacks.

40:08.614 --> 40:10.199
And where he attacks from.

40:10.282 --> 40:13.577
So now we just need to sneak into
his lair in the Upside Down

40:13.661 --> 40:15.162
and drive a stake through his heart.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.330
If he has a heart.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.582
A stake? Is he like a vamp?
Is he a vampire?

40:18.666 --> 40:20.876
-It was a metaphor.
-A bullet should work on him, right?

40:20.960 --> 40:22.378
I say we chop his head off.

40:22.461 --> 40:24.672
All of the above,
but we can't do any of that

40:24.755 --> 40:28.217
-'til we find a way into the Upside Down.
-We need El to get her powers back.

40:28.300 --> 40:31.554
Everything was way easier.
We had this girl. She had superpowers.

40:31.637 --> 40:34.056
Superpowers. Yeah, you mentioned her.

40:34.140 --> 40:38.352
Hey, uh, Henderson's not,
uh, cursed, is he?

40:38.436 --> 40:40.229
[Steve] Cursed? No, no. He's fine.

40:40.312 --> 40:42.982
-[mysterious music playing]
-Mental? Absolutely.

40:43.607 --> 40:44.817
Boom! [echoes]

40:46.527 --> 40:49.613
Bada… bada… boom.

40:50.239 --> 40:51.991
I was right.

40:52.074 --> 40:54.493
Skull Rock was north.

40:54.577 --> 40:56.704
-Seriously? You're serious?
-Mm-hmm.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.456
-This is Skull Rock. Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

40:58.539 --> 41:01.876
You're totally, absolutely,
100% wrong. Right now.

41:01.959 --> 41:02.918
Yes.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.254
And no.

41:05.337 --> 41:06.422
Oh my God.

41:06.505 --> 41:09.258
This worked correctly
when we left the Wheelers'.

41:09.341 --> 41:11.469
Correct when we got in the car on Curly.

41:11.552 --> 41:13.512
But it started to slip
the further east we went.

41:13.596 --> 41:16.098
Now it's way off.

41:16.182 --> 41:18.684
When I was leading us here,
I wasn't wrong.

41:19.643 --> 41:20.728
The compass was.

41:20.811 --> 41:22.897
So you're using faulty equipment.
You're still wrong.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.899
Except it isn't faulty.

41:24.982 --> 41:27.234
Lucas, remember what can affect a compass?

41:27.318 --> 41:29.778
-An electromagnetic field.
-Yep.

41:29.862 --> 41:31.780
Sorry. I must've skipped that class.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.700
In the presence
of a stronger electromagnetic field,

41:34.783 --> 41:37.578
the needle will deflect
towards that power.

41:37.661 --> 41:41.165
So either there's some
super big magnet around here, or…

41:41.248 --> 41:42.082
There's a gate.

41:42.708 --> 41:44.752
But we're nowhere near the lab.

41:44.835 --> 41:48.255
But what if, somehow,
there's another gate?

41:48.339 --> 41:50.007
A gate that we don't know about.

41:50.090 --> 41:52.301
It'd have to be smaller.
Way less powerful.

41:52.384 --> 41:54.011
-Snack-size gate.
-How? Why?

41:54.094 --> 41:58.057
No idea. All I know is that something
is causing this disturbance,

41:58.140 --> 42:00.893
and the last time we've seen
anything like it, it was a gate.

42:00.976 --> 42:03.771
And I hope it is
because then we'd have a way to Vecna.

42:03.854 --> 42:06.148
And a shot at freeing Max from this curse.

42:07.066 --> 42:09.818
[Steve] Where are you going?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

42:09.902 --> 42:13.239
Eddie's still a wanted man.
We can't just go hike in the woods.

42:13.322 --> 42:18.827
This little steel capsule might be the key
to saving both Max and Eddie.

42:20.162 --> 42:22.164
What say you, Eddie the Banished?

42:22.248 --> 42:24.625
[mysterious music trails off]

42:25.376 --> 42:28.629
I say you're asking me
to follow you into Mordor,

42:28.712 --> 42:31.674
which, if I'm totally straight with you,

42:31.757 --> 42:33.759
I think is a really bad idea.

42:34.301 --> 42:36.178
But, uh, the Shire…

42:36.720 --> 42:39.014
the Shire is burning.

42:39.098 --> 42:41.183
[mysterious music playing]

42:44.478 --> 42:45.813
So Mordor it is.

42:51.986 --> 42:53.529
What is Mordor?

42:54.989 --> 42:56.991
Get your stuff, dude. Let's go.

42:58.367 --> 42:59.368
[music fades]

43:00.869 --> 43:01.829
[Brenner] Today,

43:02.705 --> 43:05.040
we are going to play a game.

43:06.292 --> 43:08.627
The rules of the game are quite simple.

43:08.711 --> 43:11.297
Stay in your circle.

43:12.464 --> 43:13.966
If you leave your circle,

43:14.633 --> 43:15.884
you lose.

43:16.468 --> 43:19.388
The last person standing in their circle

43:20.347 --> 43:22.975
will get to spend
an extra hour of free time

43:23.684 --> 43:25.227
in the rainbow room.

43:25.311 --> 43:26.979
-[tense music playing]
-[Brenner chuckles]

43:27.062 --> 43:31.734
Now, even though we are going to be
competing against one another…

43:32.276 --> 43:33.319
Two.

43:34.737 --> 43:35.613
Six.

43:35.696 --> 43:39.700
…I don't want you to approach this
any differently than one of our tests.

43:39.783 --> 43:40.951
Yeah?

43:41.035 --> 43:43.495
Now, this is very important.

43:44.163 --> 43:48.250
If you allow anger or emotion

43:48.876 --> 43:50.461
to invade your thoughts,

43:52.463 --> 43:53.589
you will fail.

43:55.007 --> 43:56.008
I promise.

43:56.925 --> 43:58.177
Do you understand?

43:59.386 --> 44:01.013
[children] Yes, Papa.

44:02.473 --> 44:03.682
Good.

44:03.766 --> 44:05.643

-[toes crack]

44:06.435 --> 44:07.269

44:30.209 --> 44:31.251
Very good, Two.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.129
Number Six,

44:34.713 --> 44:35.673
please,

44:35.756 --> 44:37.383
take a seat by the door.

44:44.765 --> 44:46.225
[inhales]

44:47.768 --> 44:48.602
Five.

[industrial music pulses, fades]

45:35.399 --> 45:37.401
[tense music playing]

45:46.827 --> 45:47.745
Good luck.

45:54.126 --> 45:55.335
Begin.

45:55.419 --> 45:57.421
[music intensifies]

45:57.504 --> 45:58.964
[breathes shakily]

46:14.021 --> 46:15.022
[thud echoes]

46:19.818 --> 46:22.780
[orderly] He'd found his strength
in a memory from his past.

46:23.363 --> 46:24.823
Something that made him sad,

46:24.907 --> 46:26.408
but also angry.

46:30.746 --> 46:32.456
Do you have a memory like that?

46:33.165 --> 46:34.917
[muffled] Jane. No! No!

46:35.417 --> 46:36.460
No!

46:36.543 --> 46:37.669
[Eleven yells]

[grunting, panting]

46:59.983 --> 47:01.401
[Brenner] Well, well.

47:02.027 --> 47:03.862
It looks like we have a new winner.

47:08.033 --> 47:10.786
[triumphant synth music playing]

47:26.593 --> 47:29.638
[Yuri] I present you… Kyrzran.

47:32.266 --> 47:34.643
You see that gray steeple over there?

47:34.726 --> 47:36.311
That is Yuri's warehouse.

47:36.395 --> 47:37.813
[Joyce] Looks like a church.

47:37.896 --> 47:41.400
Let's see what miracles it holds, yes?

48:04.339 --> 48:06.258
Oh. [tuts]

48:06.341 --> 48:09.011
Someone has been in my peanut butter.

48:09.803 --> 48:12.681
Very popular, as I say, eh? [chuckles]

48:12.764 --> 48:13.640
Weapons.

48:14.141 --> 48:15.601
Where are the weapons?

48:21.648 --> 48:24.610
-Oh Jesus.
-Hey. Not in a church.

48:24.693 --> 48:28.322
You like all this?
Wait until you see my flamethrower.

48:28.405 --> 48:32.034
We don't have time for show-and-tell.
We need to get going.

48:32.117 --> 48:34.036
She's always this bossy?

48:34.119 --> 48:35.329
You heard her.

48:36.121 --> 48:37.164
[gun cocks]

48:37.247 --> 48:38.916
Keys, map.

48:38.999 --> 48:40.000
[gun clicks]

48:40.083 --> 48:41.084
Let's go.

48:43.587 --> 48:46.173
[Yuri] So, prison is here.

48:47.007 --> 48:49.009
Between these two mountains.

48:49.092 --> 48:50.928
Approximately two-hour drive.

48:51.011 --> 48:52.095
I don't see anything.

48:52.179 --> 48:55.265
Because it's not on the map,
but it is there.

48:55.349 --> 48:57.935
How do we know
you're not leading us into some trap?

48:58.018 --> 48:59.978
Because I do not need to.

49:00.062 --> 49:05.108
You want to break into
deadliest prison in all motherland.

49:05.192 --> 49:07.361
[chuckles] It is suicide.

49:07.444 --> 49:09.780
Who said anything about breaking in?

49:09.863 --> 49:12.407
Oh. You just expect to knock?

49:12.491 --> 49:16.036
"Oh hello, let me in.
I'm friendly American with a big beard."

49:16.119 --> 49:17.496
[wheezing laughter]

49:18.455 --> 49:21.083
Something like that, actually, yes.

49:21.166 --> 49:23.418
[Murray] You were planning
to turn us over to the warden.

49:23.502 --> 49:25.963
Today, if I'm not mistaken.

49:26.046 --> 49:29.091
Ah, I see now.

49:29.174 --> 49:30.968
I bring you in as prisoners

49:31.051 --> 49:33.053
and then set you free inside walls.

49:33.136 --> 49:35.681
It is risky, crazy,

49:35.764 --> 49:37.891
you will still probably die,

49:37.975 --> 49:39.393
yet I like it.

49:40.477 --> 49:42.854
But for this to work, Yuri cannot be tied.

49:42.938 --> 49:45.232
Hey, it's hard to turn over prisoners

49:45.315 --> 49:46.984
when I'm a prisoner myself.

49:47.067 --> 49:50.612
Hey, I think the warden
might find that suspicious.

49:50.696 --> 49:53.198
Which is why, from here on out,

49:53.281 --> 49:55.450
you're gonna be Murray.

49:55.534 --> 49:58.036
And I'm gonna be Yuri.

49:58.620 --> 50:00.080
I don't follow.

50:00.163 --> 50:01.123
Don't worry.

50:05.919 --> 50:07.254
It's a silent role.

50:08.046 --> 50:09.798
[chuckles] Ah!

50:09.881 --> 50:11.258
[metal swooshing]

50:25.856 --> 50:28.233
You want to make a fool of yourself,
go ahead.

50:28.316 --> 50:31.111
But to bring down these men,
leaving them with no hope,

50:31.194 --> 50:32.487
what is the purpose of that?

50:32.571 --> 50:34.698
I tell them truth.
You feed their delusion.

50:34.781 --> 50:36.199
Not delusions. Hope.

50:36.283 --> 50:39.077
I believe we can fight.
I believe we can win.

50:39.161 --> 50:40.787
I have a son, Mikhail.

50:40.871 --> 50:43.498
I cannot leave this world with him
believing his father is a traitor.

50:43.582 --> 50:46.001
I need to get back to him,
and I will get back to him.

50:46.084 --> 50:48.128
-Is he slow?
-What?

50:48.211 --> 50:51.256
Mikhail, your son.
Is… Is he slow? Is he stupid?

50:51.339 --> 50:52.466
[in Russian] Stop talking.

50:52.549 --> 50:54.509
[in English]
No, he's very smart. Top of his class.

50:54.593 --> 50:55.677
[in Russian] Be silent!

50:55.761 --> 50:56.887
[in English] Then you're not his father.

50:56.970 --> 50:57.929
[in Russian] I said go!

50:58.013 --> 50:59.473
[in English] You are drunk, American.

50:59.556 --> 51:01.933
I would stop speaking
unless you wish to die sooner.

51:02.017 --> 51:04.269
I can. It doesn't matter.
I know I'm gonna die today.

51:04.352 --> 51:07.022
But guess what?

1:03:33.726 --> 1:03:35.520
-Whoa.
-Wait, wait, wait.

1:03:37.104 --> 1:03:39.565
They're stopping.
What are they stopping for?

1:03:39.649 --> 1:03:40.983
Guys, what's going on?

1:03:41.692 --> 1:03:42.902
Come on, talk to me.

1:03:42.985 --> 1:03:43.820
What's going on?

1:03:43.903 --> 1:03:48.491
Uh, Dustin, your compass has gone
from wonky to wonky with a capital "aah!"

1:03:51.536 --> 1:03:52.870
Steve, what are you doing?

1:03:52.954 --> 1:03:54.664
Somebody's gotta go down
and check this out.

1:03:54.747 --> 1:03:58.334
Unless one of you three can top
being a Hawkins High swim co-captain

1:03:58.417 --> 1:04:00.837
and a certified lifeguard
for three years, then…

1:04:01.629 --> 1:04:03.923
it's gotta be me.
No complaints, all right?

1:04:04.924 --> 1:04:07.260
Hey, I'm not complaining.

1:04:07.343 --> 1:04:09.303
I do not wanna go down there.

1:04:19.188 --> 1:04:20.565
[Lucas] Ugh.

1:04:20.648 --> 1:04:23.442
-When'd Steve get so hairy?
-Right?

1:04:23.526 --> 1:04:25.653
I keep telling him
he needs to tame that jungle,

1:04:25.736 --> 1:04:27.613
but he claims the ladies dig it.

1:04:29.657 --> 1:04:30.867
[Max] Let me see.

1:04:30.950 --> 1:04:31.909
[Lucas] What?

1:04:44.213 --> 1:04:45.214
Hey.

1:04:45.798 --> 1:04:46.883
Good luck.

1:04:46.966 --> 1:04:47.884
Thanks.

1:04:47.967 --> 1:04:49.969
[mysterious music playing]

1:04:51.554 --> 1:04:52.388
[Robin] Gross.

1:04:54.974 --> 1:04:57.226
-[Steve breathing steadily]
-[Nancy] Steve?

1:05:00.104 --> 1:05:01.063
Be careful.

1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:07.445
[music swells]

1:05:07.528 --> 1:05:08.529
[music subsides]

1:05:23.252 --> 1:05:25.630
You guys realize,
if there's a gate down there,

1:05:25.713 --> 1:05:27.506
it's technically a water gate.

1:05:28.799 --> 1:05:30.051
[owl hooting]

1:05:30.134 --> 1:05:31.260
Watergate.

1:05:32.511 --> 1:05:33.554
[chuckles]

1:05:58.788 --> 1:06:00.289
Where we at, Wheeler?

1:06:00.373 --> 1:06:02.249
-Closing in on a minute.
-[Robin] Okay.

1:06:03.501 --> 1:06:04.418
[Robin exclaims]

1:06:04.502 --> 1:06:06.712
Come on, Steve. Come on.

1:06:06.796 --> 1:06:09.382
[indistinct radio chatter]

1:06:09.465 --> 1:06:10.299
[tense music plays]

1:06:10.383 --> 1:06:12.385
-[officer] Down by the water!
-Shit. Down!

1:06:12.969 --> 1:06:14.345
Shit. Shit.

1:06:14.428 --> 1:06:16.138
[officer] It was on this shoreline.

1:06:16.222 --> 1:06:17.223
[music subsides]

1:06:20.142 --> 1:06:22.144
[eerie sounds emanating from fissure]

1:06:25.606 --> 1:06:27.566
[water gurgling]

1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:31.445
[fissure gurgling]

1:06:37.535 --> 1:06:39.120
[jarring stinger plays]

1:06:43.165 --> 1:06:44.709
[tense music builds to climax]

1:06:47.753 --> 1:06:48.838
[Eddie clears throat]

1:06:53.259 --> 1:06:54.552
[water gushes loudly]

1:06:54.635 --> 1:06:55.594
Oh Christ!

1:06:56.554 --> 1:06:57.430
I found it.

1:06:57.513 --> 1:06:59.974
-You found it?
-I found it. Yeah. I found it.

1:07:00.057 --> 1:07:02.768
-[Steve panting]
-Dustin, you are a goddamn Einstein.

1:07:02.852 --> 1:07:05.396
-Steve found the gate--
-[siren wailing]

1:07:05.479 --> 1:07:08.024
-[Max] Cops.
-Shit, shit, shit.

1:07:08.107 --> 1:07:09.817
We can't let 'em find Eddie.

1:07:11.485 --> 1:07:12.445
Stay with me.

1:07:12.528 --> 1:07:13.821
Hey, officers!

1:07:13.904 --> 1:07:16.532
-Max!
-Over here! I found the killer! This way!

1:07:16.615 --> 1:07:17.867
-Shit.
-Go!

1:07:17.950 --> 1:07:19.035
It's pretty wild.

1:07:19.118 --> 1:07:20.911
It's more a snack-size gate
than the mama gate,

1:07:20.995 --> 1:07:23.289
but still, it's pretty damn big.

1:07:23.789 --> 1:07:24.790
[all clamoring]

1:07:28.044 --> 1:07:29.670
[all yelling]

1:07:29.754 --> 1:07:30.880
Steve!

1:07:34.341 --> 1:07:35.968
-Steve! Steve!
-[Eddie] No! No!

1:07:36.052 --> 1:07:39.555
-What the hell was that, man?
-Nancy, really, what happened?

1:07:39.638 --> 1:07:40.598
[Eddie] Jesus!

1:07:40.681 --> 1:07:41.974
[intense music playing]

1:07:43.893 --> 1:07:44.894

1:07:48.105 --> 1:07:49.190
[creature yapping]

1:07:49.273 --> 1:07:50.524
[officer] Stop!

1:07:51.233 --> 1:07:52.693
Get back here, you little rats!

1:07:54.153 --> 1:07:55.196
[grunts]

1:07:55.988 --> 1:07:57.114
Wait, wait, wait.

1:07:57.198 --> 1:08:00.076
-You're not going in there, are you?
-Just wait here.

1:08:00.576 --> 1:08:01.827
-No, Nancy!
-Nancy!

1:08:02.495 --> 1:08:03.454
[Eddie] Goddamn it!

1:08:09.251 --> 1:08:10.753
[screaming]

1:08:17.176 --> 1:08:18.511
Dustin! Shit.

1:08:21.222 --> 1:08:22.264
Hey there.

1:08:24.809 --> 1:08:26.143
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:08:26.227 --> 1:08:28.062
What are you doing? She said wait.

1:08:28.145 --> 1:08:29.146
Yeah, I heard her.

1:08:29.855 --> 1:08:30.856
She's in charge.

1:08:30.940 --> 1:08:32.108
Are you kidding me?

1:08:32.775 --> 1:08:34.110
I made that shit up.

1:08:34.693 --> 1:08:36.195
Don't you go. Don't you--

1:08:36.737 --> 1:08:39.073
Goddamn it…

1:08:39.156 --> 1:08:41.200
Son of a bitch!

1:08:41.283 --> 1:08:43.035
Oh, this is so stupid.

1:08:43.119 --> 1:08:45.830
This is so stupid.
This is so stupid. Shit! Shit! Shit!

1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:51.669
[panting]
