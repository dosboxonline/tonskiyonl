10:06.398 --> 10:07.481
if you want to come with us.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.274
Are you rushing next semester?

10:09.275 --> 10:10.651
I don't... I don't know.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.361
I don't know about that.
[chuckles nervously]

10:12.362 --> 10:13.654
Well, we both want to go Kappa

10:13.655 --> 10:15.531
because they throw
a dance marathon.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.991
Oh, it's this big party
that they throw
at the end of the year

10:17.992 --> 10:19.410
to raise money for St. Jude.

10:19.411 --> 10:22.162
You dance and all the girls
plan it together.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.914
How fun would it be
if we all joined?

10:23.915 --> 10:26.583
Because then it'd be, like,
the three of us.

10:26.584 --> 10:27.794
[gasps] Oh, yeah.

10:28.378 --> 10:29.461
[Jamie] Hmm.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.380
Uh, by the way,

10:31.381 --> 10:34.091
you can thank me later
because I am going
on a booze run.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.343
Oh, you're...
you're taking my car keys?

10:36.344 --> 10:37.761
Well, yeah.

10:37.762 --> 10:39.138
It is clutch
having a roommate with a car.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.806
Unless you want
to get the booze.

10:40.807 --> 10:42.433
Wait. Do you have a fake,
by the way?

10:42.434 --> 10:44.601
I... I do. But I don't know
if it's the best.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.020
Dude, let me see this fake.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.064
Oh, my God! All right.
Come a little closer.

10:48.565 --> 10:49.606
Smile.

10:49.607 --> 10:50.607
Little bit more.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.942
Little less.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.277
Okay, I'll go out with you.
[chuckles]

10:53.278 --> 10:55.612
Uh, it's not bad,
but it's not good.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.781
Who's, uh, Nick D'Agostino?

10:57.782 --> 11:01.326
Uh, he's this guy that was
a couple years older than me
at my high school,

11:01.327 --> 11:02.912
who sort of he died...

11:03.538 --> 11:05.956
in a car accident.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.458
Dude, why do you have this?

11:07.459 --> 11:09.794
I found it in the gym locker
before I graduated.

11:11.046 --> 11:12.880
That's really fucked up, Ben.

11:12.881 --> 11:14.757
[banging on door]

11:14.758 --> 11:16.091
[man] Campus security.

11:16.092 --> 11:17.176
- Oh, my God...
- Take this. I got this.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.803
I went to summer camp. Come on.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.973
- Sir?
- Ben Okada.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.808
- Who's that?
- I'm he.

11:24.809 --> 11:27.436
Well, your parents
contacted the school
to do a wellness check.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.313
Your girlfriend
said you were missing?

11:29.314 --> 11:30.731
You have a girlfriend?

11:30.732 --> 11:32.608
Oh, shit.
Is it that blonde girl
that lives on the floor?

11:32.609 --> 11:34.151
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Dude.

11:34.152 --> 11:35.652
- No, no, no, no.
That's my friend Jamie.
- Okay.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.113
My girlfriend's
still in high school.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.199
No, no, no, no, no, no.
She's 18, though.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.867
She just had to
repeat first grade.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.453
Ah. So you stayed
with your hometown girlfriend.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.496
Yeah.

11:45.497 --> 11:46.830
Every year, man.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.332
You always gotta learn
the hard way.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.959
And this stuff out here...
fire hazard.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.629
I promise you I will
take care of this by dusk.

11:53.630 --> 11:54.672
By dusk?

11:54.673 --> 11:56.715
Or dawn. Whatever you need.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.758
[static crackles]

11:57.759 --> 11:59.343
That's a check on Okada.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.345
[Jamie] She called
your fucking parents?

12:01.346 --> 12:04.181
I... I knew I shouldn't have
let you take my phone.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.766
Well, yeah,
and you also shouldn't have

12:05.767 --> 12:07.685
let your roommate
borrow your car

12:07.686 --> 12:09.019
and move your bed
into the hallway.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.187
Stand up for yourself.

12:10.188 --> 12:11.772
Whenever I try and do that,

12:11.773 --> 12:14.358
Claire says
I'm being toxic, so...

12:14.359 --> 12:15.317
Whoa!

12:15.318 --> 12:16.360
[sniffs] Oof.

12:16.361 --> 12:19.154
- Can you wash this for me?
- Yeah.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.657
And, you know, I still don't
get your problem with Kelly.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.909
At least I try
with my roommate.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.703
Well, she's apparently
going around

12:25.704 --> 12:27.538
telling people that I'm funny,

12:27.539 --> 12:29.832
which who even knows
what she means by that.

12:29.833 --> 12:31.208
She means you're funny.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.626
And then she was trying
to brainwash me

12:32.627 --> 12:35.004
into how amazing
sororities are.

12:35.005 --> 12:36.839
Maybe she's telling you
about sororities

12:36.840 --> 12:38.382
because she wants you to join.

12:38.383 --> 12:41.051
Okay, so I join a sorority?
How would that even go?

12:41.052 --> 12:44.596
Meet a bunch of girls
who become my best friends,

12:44.597 --> 12:46.932
and eventually one of them
is my maid of honor

12:46.933 --> 12:49.268
and our families
start vacationing together,

12:49.269 --> 12:51.061
and her kids
call me Aunt Jamie,

12:51.062 --> 12:52.563
even though we're not related?

12:52.564 --> 12:54.857
Why are you saying good things
like they're bad things?

12:54.858 --> 12:56.233
It sounds like
you want to join.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.735
Because it's obviously
some sort of trap,

12:57.736 --> 12:59.820
and I'm sorry, but no!

12:59.821 --> 13:01.238
What if I rush
and they don't like me?

13:01.239 --> 13:03.615
- What if I don't even get in?
- Okay.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.369
I've, uh... I've tried
not to bring it up, but...

13:07.370 --> 13:09.079
Do you think
any of this is in your head

13:09.080 --> 13:11.832
because of the whole
home wrecker thing?

13:11.833 --> 13:13.876
What? No.

13:13.877 --> 13:14.960
That was so long ago.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.045
I'm just saying,

13:16.046 --> 13:17.963
maybe you're weird about Kelly

13:17.964 --> 13:20.049
because Megan
and the girls in our grade
were pretty brutal to you.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.343
This has nothing,
nothing to do with that.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.720
Hey, we were young.
Whatever happened then--

13:24.721 --> 13:26.847
What do you mean,
"what happened"?

13:26.848 --> 13:28.265
You know nothing happened.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.477
Do I? You never talk about it.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.855
Fine.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.273
But the important thing to know

13:36.274 --> 13:38.692
is that Megan Mendelson
and I were best friends,

13:38.693 --> 13:43.030
and I would never
do anything to hurt her
or her family.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.782
<i>It was the summer
before seventh grade,</i>

13:44.783 --> 13:46.450
<i>and we did everything together.</i>

13:46.451 --> 13:48.660
<i>Then came Megan's
twelfth birthday,</i>

13:48.661 --> 13:50.079
<i>the event of the season.</i>

13:50.080 --> 13:51.872
<i>Everyone cool
in our grade was there.</i>

13:51.873 --> 13:52.873
[Ben] <i>Wait. I wasn't there.</i>

13:52.874 --> 13:54.291
[Jamie] <i>Yeah, I know.</i>

13:54.292 --> 13:56.502
<i>So there I was,
side by side with Megan,</i>

13:56.503 --> 13:58.128
<i>hula-hooping,</i>

13:58.129 --> 13:59.463
<i>and it was a joint effort
to get the attention</i>

13:59.464 --> 14:01.298
<i>of the hottest boy
in our grade,</i>

14:01.299 --> 14:03.050
<i>Dante Saprito.</i>

14:03.051 --> 14:04.468
[Ben] <i>Dante's been hot forever.</i>

14:04.469 --> 14:05.969
[Jamie] <i>And that's
when it happened.</i>

14:05.970 --> 14:07.971
[bee buzzing]

14:07.972 --> 14:11.183
[Jamie] <i>I got stung
by a fucking bee.</i>

14:11.184 --> 14:12.351
[screams]

14:12.352 --> 14:14.645
<i>As you know,
I'm highly allergic.</i>

14:14.646 --> 14:16.980
<i>I ran inside
to find Megan's parents.</i>

14:16.981 --> 14:18.774
<i>I panicked.</i>

14:18.775 --> 14:21.985
<i>It was a medical emergency,
and I did what I had to do.</i>

14:21.986 --> 14:23.821
I took my shirt off
in front of her dad.

14:23.822 --> 14:25.531
No. Mm-mm.

14:25.532 --> 14:27.658
- [gasps]
- [cake thuds]

14:27.659 --> 14:30.495
[Jamie] <i>Then from there,
the situation was taken
completely out of context.</i>

14:31.413 --> 14:33.163
<i>The unfortunate coincidence</i>

14:33.164 --> 14:36.000
<i>that Megan's parents chose
that fucking weekend</i>

14:36.001 --> 14:37.501
<i>to tell her
they were getting a divorce</i>

14:37.502 --> 14:40.004
<i>made people
draw the absurd conclusion</i>

14:40.005 --> 14:41.839
<i>that seeing
my undeveloped naked torso</i>

14:41.840 --> 14:45.509
<i>caused Mr. Mendelson
to end his 19-year marriage.</i>

14:45.510 --> 14:48.679
And from then on,
I was home wrecker.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.015
<i>Megan turned every girl
in our grade against me,</i>

14:51.016 --> 14:53.809
<i>despite the fact
that I was having
a medical emergency</i>

14:53.810 --> 14:55.894
and her dad
is a fucking doctor!

14:55.895 --> 14:59.024
Technically, Mr. Mendelson
is actually a chiropractor.

15:00.358 --> 15:01.859
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Dude.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.152
Not helpful. Fuck Megan.

15:03.153 --> 15:05.404
[sighs] It's fine.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.031
It taught me
the valuable lesson in life

15:07.032 --> 15:09.908
that most people
are secretly terrible.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.245
All right, but...

15:13.121 --> 15:16.165
Mm, but... tonight

15:16.166 --> 15:17.374
I will try to have fun.

15:17.375 --> 15:21.003
- Ah! There she is.
- All right.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.713
Let's go make
some fucking memories.

15:22.714 --> 15:24.214
Okay.

15:24.215 --> 15:26.259
- [dance music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

15:29.054 --> 15:30.054
[Jamie] All right.
We're dancing.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.722
Where are we starting tonight?

15:31.723 --> 15:33.308
I think it's in the shoulders.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.894
[Jamie] Mm. Mm. Mm. Mm.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.729
Ooh. I think it's moving
down to the hips.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.065
- Yeah? Hips? Okay.
- Yeah.

15:42.776 --> 15:44.069
Just the eyes! Eyes only.

15:48.406 --> 15:49.531
[both laugh]

15:49.532 --> 15:50.240
Yo!

15:50.241 --> 15:52.910
Let's fucking rock!

15:52.911 --> 15:54.579
[all cheering]

15:56.164 --> 15:58.874
[indistinct chatter]

15:58.875 --> 15:59.958
[cell phone ringing]

15:59.959 --> 16:01.418
Oh, shit. Palmer's calling.

16:01.419 --> 16:02.920
Hey!

16:02.921 --> 16:04.296
- [Palmer over phone]
<i>Hi, how are you?
- Bonjour.</i>

16:04.297 --> 16:05.506
[Palmer] <i>Oh, both of you.</i>

16:05.507 --> 16:06.590
[Ben] Why are you awake?

16:06.591 --> 16:08.467
Looks like a gorgeous morning
in Paris.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.386
It is a gorgeous morning
in Paris,

16:10.387 --> 16:12.471
and I'm awake because
I have the opening shift
at my job,

16:12.472 --> 16:15.140
<i>where I contribute
to society, as a worker.</i>

16:15.141 --> 16:18.143
Ugh, yes. Society needed you
to take a gap year

16:18.144 --> 16:19.728
and work at Euro Disney, Palm.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.271
I've told you a million times,

16:21.272 --> 16:23.107
the bistro I work at
is outside the park's entrance.

16:23.108 --> 16:24.858
As in, it's not Euro Disney.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.026
It's a separate
business entity.

16:26.027 --> 16:27.653
[Ben] <i>Hey, Palm.</i>

16:27.654 --> 16:28.946
- We're drunk.
- Yeah, and we're going
to a party.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.531
<i>Oh, my God, a party?</i>

16:30.532 --> 16:32.533
<i>- You guys are crazy.</i>
- [chuckles sarcastically]

16:32.534 --> 16:34.535
Speaking of parties,
I am planning to host

16:34.536 --> 16:36.662
a <i>petite soiree</i>
the Wednesday
before Thanksgiving.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.289
<i>- Oh, you're coming back?
- Yeah.</i>

16:39.290 --> 16:40.958
<i>Didn't you say your parents
were doing Thanksgiving on,
like, a cruise or something?</i>

16:40.959 --> 16:42.710
Yes. Martha and David
are boarding

16:42.711 --> 16:44.253
<i>Her Majesty
The Atlantic Princess</i>
as we speak.

16:44.254 --> 16:45.879
But I declined.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.298
I mean, ultimately,
why does someone
move to France?

16:48.299 --> 16:51.301
<i>To return from France
and prove to everyone
we went to high school with</i>

16:51.302 --> 16:53.137
<i>that I am now better than them.</i>

16:53.138 --> 16:56.306
Also that I'm no longer
vaguely pretending
to be straight.

16:56.307 --> 16:59.143
<i>- Oh! That's great, Palm.
- Let's go!</i>

16:59.144 --> 17:00.394
[Jamie] <i>Yes!</i>

17:00.395 --> 17:02.146
Yeah.
So for my grand coming out,

17:02.147 --> 17:05.566
I will be hosting
a curated gathering
of former classmates

17:05.567 --> 17:07.651
before everyone blacks out
at Kurt's lake house.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.069
- Brilliant!
- Oh, we love it. We love it.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.904
- We'll be there.
- Yeah!

17:10.905 --> 17:12.531
- [man over phone speaking
indistinctly in French]
<i>- Oh, shit.</i>

17:12.532 --> 17:13.533
<i>My boss is mad.</i>

17:14.325 --> 17:15.618
<i>Bonjour, Claude!</i>

17:16.828 --> 17:17.703
<i>I gotta go.</i>

17:17.704 --> 17:19.330
<i>Bonsoir, Palm.</i>

17:20.540 --> 17:21.999
[Jamie] Okay.
You ready for this?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.250
[Ben] Let's see
what we've been missing.

17:23.251 --> 17:24.668
[Luther] Whoo!
Let's get fucked up!

17:24.669 --> 17:26.713
- [music playing]
- [all chanting] Slap the bag!

17:31.051 --> 17:32.843
- You gonna go over there?
- Yes.

17:32.844 --> 17:34.511
Don't rush me.

17:34.512 --> 17:37.806
- College starts tonight.
- College starts tonight.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.642
Hey, don't leave this party
without me.

17:40.185 --> 17:42.228
[all shouting]

17:43.897 --> 17:45.314
Ben, dude!

17:45.315 --> 17:47.316
Yo, let's get this guy
some Forty Hands!

17:47.317 --> 17:49.443
[in sing-song voice] Ho-ho.
My roommate's not a bitch.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.362
- He came out to the party.
- Oh, thank you.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.322
- We gonna--
- Uh, when do we get them off?

17:53.323 --> 17:55.283
Uh, when you
fucking finish, bro.

17:55.784 --> 17:56.659
Okay.

17:59.621 --> 18:01.663
- You guys are all...
- No idea what's in there.

18:01.664 --> 18:03.207
- Super cute, okay.
- Love that.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.375
- Good.
- So yeah.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.751
So I'm on
the philanthropy board.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.544
Um, Kelly told you
about dance marathon?

18:07.545 --> 18:09.880
Yes, I... I love being tired.

18:09.881 --> 18:12.174
It's like basically
my whole personality.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.884
- Love you.
- That's hilarious.

18:13.885 --> 18:15.761
Kelly was right.
You're so funny.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.680
- By the way, Dylan's here.
Dylan's here.
- Oh, my God.

18:17.681 --> 18:19.640
Kelly, this is the guy that
I wanted to set you up with.

18:19.641 --> 18:22.810
- He's gonna be
so obsessed with you.
- Wait, really? Okay.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.145
So, you wanna meet
any cute guys here?

18:25.146 --> 18:27.564
I know... I know some guys.

18:27.565 --> 18:29.775
Oh, no, I'm still
with my boyfriend back home.

18:29.776 --> 18:32.569
I stayed with
my high school boyfriend
at college as well.

18:32.570 --> 18:34.530
Aw, really?
Are you guys still together?

18:34.531 --> 18:36.073
Oh, no.

18:36.074 --> 18:39.076
He immediately cheated on me,
like, the first week of school,

18:39.077 --> 18:42.205
so I registered him
as a sex offender.

18:44.165 --> 18:45.250
Mm-hmm.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.252
I got my dick sucked
on a ski lift.

18:48.253 --> 18:50.045
That... that sounds freezing.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.630
Dude, it was awesome.

18:51.631 --> 18:52.548
- Hey.
- Oh!

18:52.549 --> 18:54.426
- [chuckling] Okay.
- Ty--

18:55.844 --> 18:57.262
- Hi.
- Hi. Hi.

18:58.388 --> 18:59.680
I love your curls.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.641
Oh, thank you.
I like your curls.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.856
I... have a girlfriend.
She lives in Ohio.

19:08.857 --> 19:10.232
I don't believe you.

19:10.233 --> 19:12.234
I... I do. I really--

19:12.235 --> 19:13.610
Tyler, Tyler!

19:13.611 --> 19:15.947
Don't I have a girlfriend
who lives in Ohio?

No. [mouthing]

19:20.785 --> 19:21.869

19:21.870 --> 19:23.871
Besides all, like,
the legal fallout,

19:23.872 --> 19:26.123
him cheating on me
was literally the best thing

19:26.124 --> 19:27.541
that could have
ever happened to me.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.376
Because the day after,
I saw these Kappa girls,

19:29.377 --> 19:30.961
and they were like, "Join!"
and I was like, "Yes!"

19:30.962 --> 19:34.840
because before that,
I literally had zero friends.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.133
Could you imagine?

19:36.134 --> 19:38.010
- That would be hard.
- I am so happy.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.970

about Brandon anymore.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.388

19:41.389 --> 19:43.015
Legally, I cannot
talk about him.

Oh.

19:44.267 --> 19:45.477
Brandon isn't even
his real name.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.644
It's Jordan McFeery.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.438
- Oh, I see.
- Hey, Hannah, you ready?

19:49.439 --> 19:50.731
Oh, my God. Yes, girl!

to text my boyfriend.

threw a drink on us

that girl tonight

if that's true anymore.

do I love Simon?

25:06.798 --> 25:09.967

when I'm uncomfortable

of breaking up with her.

I don't have service?

25:45.712 --> 25:47.713
I think we need to do this.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.841
I think we need
to break up with them.

25:50.550 --> 25:53.052
Yeah, I know.

25:53.053 --> 25:56.347
- It'll... it'll suck,
but we'll do it together.
- Mm-hmm.

25:56.348 --> 25:59.058
And then we'll have
the rest of college to have fun

25:59.059 --> 26:02.394
- and try things and have sex.
- Mm-hmm.

26:02.395 --> 26:04.438
Uh... with other people.

26:04.439 --> 26:06.065
- Strangers. Different...
- Oh. Yeah, yeah.

that we meet.
- I get it.

26:08.109 --> 26:09.735

with them.

[Ben] Drink some water, bud.

26:17.702 --> 26:19.536
[Jamie] Not too much water.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.789
We need to do
these breakups right,

26:21.790 --> 26:23.374
because we're good people,

26:23.375 --> 26:24.793
and that means face to face.

26:25.543 --> 26:27.711
No texts, no phone calls.

26:27.712 --> 26:29.546
In person,
over Thanksgiving break.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.131
Simon goes
back to school on Friday

26:31.132 --> 26:32.883
because he has a game
that weekend.

26:32.884 --> 26:34.677
Claire goes to her dad's
on Friday

26:34.678 --> 26:36.346
and Thursday's Thanksgiving.

26:37.180 --> 26:38.223
So it's Wednesday.

26:39.474 --> 26:41.225
Thanksgiving Eve.

26:41.226 --> 26:42.644
The day love dies.

26:44.187 --> 26:45.187
Okay.

26:45.188 --> 26:46.897
So we find
alone time with them,

26:46.898 --> 26:49.608
early afternoon,
before everyone goes out.

26:49.609 --> 26:51.611
Mm. Here's your problem
with that.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.572
If left alone
in a private place,

26:55.573 --> 26:57.241
Claire and I
will end up having sex.

26:57.242 --> 26:59.743
Okay, so don't
have sex with her.

26:59.744 --> 27:01.537
Mm-mm. It's not that simple.

27:01.538 --> 27:05.249
Like most people
with an undiagnosed
personality disorder,

27:05.250 --> 27:06.917
Claire is incredible
at fucking.

27:06.918 --> 27:08.752
What's that even mean?

27:08.753 --> 27:10.421
I mean, don't we all, like,
have the same basic
set of moves?

27:10.422 --> 27:12.256
It goes in, it goes out.
I don't... I don't get it.

27:12.257 --> 27:13.966
It's... it's Claire.
I can't explain it to you.

27:13.967 --> 27:16.385
Okay, so,
when we get home on Wednesday,

27:16.386 --> 27:19.555
I'll go to Simon's house
and you ask Claire to go
on a public walk.

27:19.556 --> 27:21.265
Right.

27:21.266 --> 27:23.267
And we need to practice
what we're gonna
say beforehand.

27:23.268 --> 27:26.311
These days,
there's a lot of fallout
from a breakup gone badly.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.230
They know things about us.

27:28.231 --> 27:30.774
"They know things"?
What do they know
that could hurt us?

27:30.775 --> 27:32.526
Are you kidding?

27:32.527 --> 27:35.446
There's no way
Claire doesn't have
a full dossier on you.

27:35.447 --> 27:36.865
I really don't think--

27:38.575 --> 27:40.576
- Oh. Actually...
- Mm.

27:40.577 --> 27:42.370
Mm-hmm. See? I knew it. What?

27:44.247 --> 27:47.916
Well, you remember
how Claire played Sandy
in the fall musical?

27:47.917 --> 27:49.543
Yes, but now I'm nervous.

27:49.544 --> 27:52.797
She may or may not have
had us do some long distance...

27:53.465 --> 27:55.466
<i>Grease</i> roleplay

27:55.467 --> 27:58.927
that culminated in me sending
a pretty explicit video.

27:58.928 --> 28:01.681
Ben, a video of what?

28:02.932 --> 28:07.728
Technically, one could say
I was masturbating

28:07.729 --> 28:09.981
in character as Danny Zuko.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.317
Absolutely unacceptable.

28:13.318 --> 28:16.028
- Yeah, we cannot do
these breakups over text.
- Okay.

28:16.029 --> 28:18.614
So our midterm
gets out at 11:00.

28:18.615 --> 28:19.865
We'll sprint to the car.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.367
That gets us
back to Ohio by 5:00,

28:21.368 --> 28:23.827
which gives us two hours
before the football game

28:23.828 --> 28:26.997
to thoughtfully,
respectfully, lovingly,

28:26.998 --> 28:28.707
end our first relationships.

28:28.708 --> 28:31.002
You're right.
It's the perfect plan.

28:34.172 --> 28:35.297
Danny Zuko.

28:35.298 --> 28:38.175
Oh, my God,
that was fucking hard.

28:38.176 --> 28:41.011
He's the worst
fictional character
of all time.

28:41.012 --> 28:43.597
Fictional? Jamie,
King Arthur was a real dude.

28:43.598 --> 28:47.227
What? Wow.
I did not do well at all.

28:48.144 --> 28:51.063
All right. It's 11:08.

28:51.064 --> 28:52.816
This is good.
We're making good time.

28:54.651 --> 28:56.777
Uh, where's your car?

28:56.778 --> 28:58.070
This is where I parked.

28:58.071 --> 29:00.489
Could you be
remembering wrong or...

29:00.490 --> 29:01.532
Uh, one sec.

29:06.162 --> 29:07.705
Uh, hey, I was just wondering

29:07.706 --> 29:09.790
if maybe
you borrowed my car again

29:09.791 --> 29:12.167
- and parked it somewhere
other than structure B.

29:12.168 --> 29:14.336

for these tires.</i>
- Colorado?

29:24.681 --> 29:26.473
You're absolutely right.

29:26.474 --> 29:27.891
- I should get chains
for my tires.
<i>- Hey, I'm always right.</i>

29:27.892 --> 29:29.768
Absolutely.
Happy Thanksgiving, bud.

- [Tyler] <i>Gobble gobble, my boy.</i>
[mimics turkey]
- Okay. Bye.

29:31.438 --> 29:32.938
Are you fucking kidding me?

29:32.939 --> 29:35.899
I need to set more boundaries.
I'm aware.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.985
You realize
this ruins the plan?

29:37.986 --> 29:40.571
[scoffs] We're gonna
end up doing Thanksgiving
in the dining hall with Luther,

29:40.572 --> 29:42.948
- and be stuck in these
relationships till we die.
- Okay. Okay.

29:42.949 --> 29:46.744
Well, there's a bus
that leaves in 45 minutes
that gets into Ohio at 9:00.

29:46.745 --> 29:49.121
9:00? The foot...
The football game's
gonna be over.

29:49.122 --> 29:50.748
Everyone will be out by then.

29:50.749 --> 29:52.083
Do you have a better idea?

29:52.584 --> 29:53.460
[sighs]

29:58.214 --> 30:01.216
Oh. Well, I guess
we can't sit together.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.426
No way.

30:02.427 --> 30:04.262
We need
to rehearse these breakups.

30:07.891 --> 30:09.933
Watch and learn, Benjamin.

30:09.934 --> 30:12.353
Excuse me. Oh. Hi.

30:12.354 --> 30:15.606
Hey. Um, would you mind
moving to the seat over here

30:15.607 --> 30:17.775
so the two of us
can sit together?

30:17.776 --> 30:20.444
You know, actually,
I'd rather stay where I am.
Thank you.

30:20.445 --> 30:21.404
Oh.

30:23.490 --> 30:25.783
Well, um, excuse me.

30:25.784 --> 30:27.785

designated caretaker,

30:36.086 --> 30:37.629
I need to sit next to him.

30:39.339 --> 30:40.215
Pfft.

30:41.800 --> 30:42.758
Sounds real tough.

30:42.759 --> 30:43.842

How did the breakup go?

31:49.451 --> 31:51.744
How did Claire take it?
Did she cry?

31:51.745 --> 31:53.620
Well, we hit a bit of a snag.

31:53.621 --> 31:55.956
We had to take the bus,
so we're actually
gonna be late.

31:55.957 --> 31:57.416

coming though, right?

Yep, we're coming.
But we need your help.

32:02.047 --> 32:04.048
We missed our window,
and now Simon and Claire

32:04.049 --> 32:05.341
are both going
to the football game.

32:05.342 --> 32:07.676
Football game?
Like, at our high school?

32:07.677 --> 32:08.719
To what end?

32:08.720 --> 32:10.095
Because people like football

32:10.096 --> 32:12.056
and Claire is singing
the national anthem.

32:12.057 --> 32:14.975
Claire's singing
the national anthem.

32:14.976 --> 32:16.727
Wow. [chuckles]

32:16.728 --> 32:20.189
I guess the talent pool
at Cranford High
is really starved.

32:20.190 --> 32:22.775

breaking up with them tonight.

Uh-huh. But after the game,
everyone's either going
to Duffy's or Kurt's,

32:29.699 --> 32:32.159
and there's gonna be no place
to have a serious conversation.

32:32.160 --> 32:35.913

to meet us at your house.

Yeah. Otherwise,
Simon's dumb friends are gonna
drag him to the party.

at your house
as soon as we get in.

was strolling the

was French myself,

33:02.941 --> 33:04.942
Yes, we are.

33:04.943 --> 33:07.444
Okay, fine. But only because
I'm extremely excited

33:07.445 --> 33:09.279
to see Claire flop
in front of the entire town.

of my lines in <i>Pippin</i>
last year.

33:15.954 --> 33:18.122

Yes, we have heard.

33:21.710 --> 33:23.752
Thank you, Palmer. Thank you.

Now I need to reimagine
my look for a football game.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.132
I have to go. Bye.

33:50.739 --> 33:53.449
I go to Harvard
with this French guy
named Jean-Luc.

33:53.450 --> 33:56.410
He's fucking hilarious.
Any chance you've met him?

33:56.411 --> 33:59.455
Um, sorry.
Do you know where he lives?

34:00.457 --> 34:02.166
That's where you live, right?

You know what, Simon?

I'm so glad that Harvard
hasn't changed you.

- How's Cambridge treating you?

34:13.136 --> 34:14.386
You know, not too bad.

Just hoping
if I play well this year,

34:16.056 --> 34:18.349
I can get another look
from Ohio State.
Maybe transfer.

35:38.430 --> 35:40.055
Sounds like you two
are breaking up?

35:40.056 --> 35:41.265
We're not breaking up
with each other.

35:41.266 --> 35:43.809
We're breaking up
with other people.

35:43.810 --> 35:45.269
Jamie, stand down.

35:45.270 --> 35:47.479
Interesting, 'cause I thought
you were engaged.

35:47.480 --> 35:49.648
It's called having an affair.

35:49.649 --> 35:51.525
Having an affair?
What are you, 16?

35:51.526 --> 35:53.152
No, we're in college, dumbass.

35:53.153 --> 35:54.570
I know you're in college.

35:54.571 --> 35:56.613
I'm sitting
two fucking feet from you.

35:56.614 --> 35:58.866
What do you think,
these are soundproof seats?

35:58.867 --> 36:00.451
It's a Greyhound bus.

36:00.452 --> 36:02.202
I got to sit here
with this lady, who,

36:02.203 --> 36:03.996
no offense,

36:03.997 --> 36:05.956
but you are kind of cutting
onto my fucking leg room
over here.

36:05.957 --> 36:08.625
And I gotta listen to you
drone on about your breakups.

36:08.626 --> 36:11.503
"Oh, baby,
I really want you in my life,

36:11.504 --> 36:14.131
but not as bad
as I want to get fingered
at a frat party."

36:14.132 --> 36:16.967
And now, you pick
the most cliched weekend

36:16.968 --> 36:19.136
in the history
of breaking up with people

36:19.137 --> 36:20.972

36:23.433 --> 36:26.393
Also, I know
you don't have epilepsy.

that we took your seat, sir.

36:28.063 --> 36:29.188

- Yeah.

they picked something
in your vocal range this year.

Simon, over here.

37:19.155 --> 37:21.573

37:21.574 --> 37:23.283

we could all ride together

37:25.412 --> 37:26.954

37:28.581 --> 37:31.250
Yo, are you guys
going to Duffy's before Kurt's?

37:31.251 --> 37:32.710
- Yeah. For sure.
- Yeah.

37:32.711 --> 37:34.586
Oh. You guys are doing

Should we just
meet them at Palmer's
and go out from there?

37:38.383 --> 37:40.217
Yeah, I mean,
that makes sense, right?
My phone's dead. So...

37:40.218 --> 37:42.302
Just gonna fight my way back
into the conversation here.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.054
Hi. Uh, it's gonna
be really fun.

37:44.055 --> 37:45.431
There's gonna be appetizers,

37:45.432 --> 37:48.225
world-class cocktails,
spirited debate, me.

37:48.226 --> 37:49.894
You know. So...

- Hi, Rhonda.

Rhonda's brother

I'm sending you back to school
with a Triple-A card. Period.

Right? Right, Norman? Yes.

- Hi, Mr. Okada.
- Hi, Dad.

38:13.209 --> 38:15.377
- [Jamie] How are you?
- [Norman] It's good to see you.

38:15.378 --> 38:16.587
- How's it going?
- Good, good.

38:16.588 --> 38:17.921

Oh, Benny.
Did you get the passport?

38:23.803 --> 38:25.429
I FedExed it, and I was worried

38:25.430 --> 38:26.889
that it was gonna,
like, get stolen.

38:26.890 --> 38:28.557
Have you heard
about these porch pirates?

38:28.558 --> 38:30.726
- No, this is real.
- I know. I got it. I got it.

38:30.727 --> 38:33.437
But I haven't had the chance
to tell Jamie

38:33.438 --> 38:35.314
that I'm definitely going yet.

38:35.315 --> 38:37.232
I'm a little worried
that she's gonna feel
like I'm abandoning her.

38:37.233 --> 38:39.443

not mention Copenhagen.
- Okay.

- You guys ready?

38:45.950 --> 38:47.034
Yeah.

38:47.035 --> 38:48.619
All right.

38:48.620 --> 38:50.621
Oh. Diane, are you sure
you don't want to...

38:50.622 --> 38:52.206
You don't want to sit up front?

38:52.207 --> 38:53.957
Are you kidding?
I haven't seen you guys
in months.

38:53.958 --> 38:55.292
I'm in the back with you.

39:09.265 --> 39:10.641
Hello. [chuckles]

39:10.642 --> 39:13.477
Some hors d'oeuvres
for <i>mes amis,</i>

39:13.478 --> 39:15.979
which means
"my friends" in French.

39:15.980 --> 39:18.107
Just get this open.

39:18.108 --> 39:20.610
When you go
to a really nice restaurant,
they do it for you.

39:21.486 --> 39:22.904
- [cork pops]
- Jeepies.

39:23.405 --> 39:24.655
[laughs]

39:24.656 --> 39:25.864
Whoo!

39:25.865 --> 39:27.991
So, Champagne is actually
a region in France,

39:27.992 --> 39:30.619
and if the grapes
aren't actually picked there,

39:30.620 --> 39:32.038
it's not really champagne.

39:32.997 --> 39:34.623
Dope.

39:34.624 --> 39:36.960
Something that you learn
when you live in France.

39:38.336 --> 39:39.921
So, can we, like,

39:40.964 --> 39:42.089
drink it now?

39:42.090 --> 39:44.633
First, a little bit
of the green stuff.

39:44.634 --> 39:47.845
[chuckles] The green stuff's
just absinthe.

39:47.846 --> 39:50.180
This drink is called
Death in the Afternoon.

39:50.181 --> 39:53.685
It was supposedly
Hemingway's favorite drink.

39:54.644 --> 39:56.478
And he was an alcoholic.

39:56.479 --> 39:58.188
So he knew how to drink.

39:58.189 --> 40:00.149
He, um, he drank quite a bit.

40:00.150 --> 40:02.401
Probably a pretty tough guy
to be around.

40:02.402 --> 40:04.737
'Cause of the alcoholism.

40:04.738 --> 40:07.906
And then, ultimately,
he killed himself.

40:07.907 --> 40:09.324
[bottle thuds]

40:09.325 --> 40:11.077
Here we go. That's for you.

40:12.537 --> 40:13.830
So, to...

40:15.540 --> 40:17.124
Okay.

40:17.125 --> 40:18.418
Don't have to cheers.

40:19.461 --> 40:22.588
Well, I'm gonna
just run upstairs

40:22.589 --> 40:23.881
and do a quick costume change

40:23.882 --> 40:25.550
before the rest
of my guests arrive.

40:26.009 --> 40:26.800
Cool, man.

40:26.801 --> 40:29.554
And my house is your house.

40:32.557 --> 40:33.974
All right.

40:33.975 --> 40:36.519
- This actually isn't bad.
Here you go.
- Yeah.

40:39.981 --> 40:41.774
[Diane] Okay.
So tell me everything.

40:41.775 --> 40:45.361
How's class? How are the dorms?
How is the famous Tyler?

40:45.362 --> 40:47.321
Oh, yeah.
How's the famous Tyler?

40:47.322 --> 40:49.073
He's good. Everything is good.

40:49.074 --> 40:51.533
Oh! I am just so glad
to have you guys back.

40:51.534 --> 40:52.659
This is so much fun.

40:52.660 --> 40:54.286
It's like we're in an Uber.

40:54.287 --> 40:56.246
Oh. Five stars, Norman.

40:56.247 --> 40:57.956
Thank you. [chuckles]

40:57.957 --> 40:59.541
Oh, that reminds me.
We were in an Uber
the other day.

40:59.542 --> 41:01.460
The driver was so interesting.

41:01.461 --> 41:04.004
He is in the middle
of writing a novel

41:04.005 --> 41:06.215
about a guy
who lives in a lighthouse,

41:06.216 --> 41:07.591
but he's really a centaur,

41:07.592 --> 41:09.510
so he can't
get down the stairs.

41:09.511 --> 41:10.928
But that doesn't make sense.

41:10.929 --> 41:12.763
How'd he get up there
in the first place?

41:12.764 --> 41:14.932
Oh. Uh, sorry. Uh, Mr. Okada.
Do you mind turning up here?

41:14.933 --> 41:17.017
We're actually
going to Palmer's.

41:17.018 --> 41:18.811
What? You're not gonna
come back and have something
to eat first?

41:18.812 --> 41:20.604
I made meaty macaroni.

41:20.605 --> 41:22.606
That is so nice of you, Diane,

41:22.607 --> 41:25.109
but we told Palmer
we'd go straight there.

41:25.110 --> 41:27.945
It's, um, it's kind of
an important night for him.

41:27.946 --> 41:29.531
- What?
- [Norman] What's so important?

41:30.782 --> 41:32.866
[Ben] Um, well, Dad, uh,

41:32.867 --> 41:36.078
Palmer has decided
that he's ready to share
some information

41:36.079 --> 41:39.790
about his personal life
and his identity, and--

41:39.791 --> 41:41.208
Oh. That he's a gay guy.

41:41.209 --> 41:42.167
Uh...

41:42.168 --> 41:44.670
Yes. Technically, yes.

41:44.671 --> 41:46.672
[Norman] Well,
that's not exactly news.

41:46.673 --> 41:48.090
When you were kids,

41:48.091 --> 41:49.842
he went as Princess Di
six Halloweens in a row.

41:49.843 --> 41:52.011
I loved it when he would wear
the oversized sweatshirts

41:52.012 --> 41:53.595
with the little...
little bike shorts.

41:53.596 --> 41:55.139
Well, for the record,

41:55.140 --> 41:57.725
a boy dressing as a princess
doesn't make him gay.

41:57.726 --> 42:00.978
Ben, we know that, okay?
Those are "gender norms."

42:00.979 --> 42:03.147
We are very familiar
with those. [chuckles]

42:03.148 --> 42:04.232
But he is gay?

42:05.316 --> 42:06.650
Isn't he gay?

42:06.651 --> 42:08.610
The point is that
we're going to support him,

42:08.611 --> 42:10.821
and we can talk
about gender norms tomorrow
at Thanksgiving dinner

42:10.822 --> 42:13.742

It should be...

42:14.784 --> 42:16.326

42:16.327 --> 42:19.121
Princess Di,
she was having an affair
with a bodyguard.

42:19.122 --> 42:21.582
Well, Prince Charles
was a real jerk.

42:21.583 --> 42:23.126
He treated her horribly.

his gay birthright

to live somewhere
far more expensive
and fabulous than here.

55:36.419 --> 55:37.836
- [chuckles]
- [Palmer] Okay.

55:37.837 --> 55:40.130
Because it's vastly superior
to stay in a town

55:40.131 --> 55:43.759
where the hardest place
to get a reservation
is the Spaghetti Outlet.

55:43.760 --> 55:46.638
No, I mean, I get it.
I had my New York years.

55:47.222 --> 55:48.931
[laughing] Oh!

55:48.932 --> 55:49.973
You did?

55:49.974 --> 55:51.558
Yeah. I moved there
when I was 17.

55:51.559 --> 55:53.852
You know,
I became a starving model,

55:53.853 --> 55:55.771
I sort of hovered
around the outskirts

55:55.772 --> 55:57.356
of Leighton Meister's
entourage.

55:57.357 --> 55:58.982
I had a very chic coke problem.

55:58.983 --> 55:59.817
I did it all.

55:59.818 --> 56:01.443
Ethan, that sounds awesome.

56:01.444 --> 56:03.320
Uh, why would you
come back here?

56:03.321 --> 56:04.988
Well, my mom got sick.

56:04.989 --> 56:06.990
And I ran out of money,

56:06.991 --> 56:10.452
and I sort of realized
that I was spiritually empty
and completely lost.

56:10.453 --> 56:12.454
And then, I don't know,
being back here,

56:12.455 --> 56:13.747
it made me realize
I wanted to do

56:13.748 --> 56:15.332
something semi-meaningful
with my life.

56:15.333 --> 56:16.875
So, long story short,

56:16.876 --> 56:21.088
I did EMT training
and became a firefighter.

56:21.089 --> 56:24.717
You stayed
in middle of nowhere Ohio
to be a firefighter?

56:24.718 --> 56:26.343
Don't they have those
in New York?

56:26.344 --> 56:29.096
- Well, he stayed because
he's obsessed with me.
- Okay.

56:29.097 --> 56:33.142
We matched on an app
while I was taking care
of my mom, that's all.

56:33.143 --> 56:34.143
Oh, that's all?

56:34.144 --> 56:35.060
- Yeah.
- That's all?

56:35.061 --> 56:36.353
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

56:36.354 --> 56:38.022
Okay. All right.
I'm obsessed with him.

56:38.023 --> 56:40.107
I'm obsessed with him.

56:40.108 --> 56:44.695
Okay, if I'm being honest,
Paris is a little lonely.

56:44.696 --> 56:47.614
And working at Euro Disney
is a unique form of hell.

56:47.615 --> 56:49.950
Oh, my God. Euro Disney?

56:49.951 --> 56:53.328
This is so much worse
than I thought.

56:53.329 --> 56:55.039
Listen, I'm going to
tell you this

56:55.040 --> 56:56.874
because somebody
needed to tell it to me,

56:56.875 --> 56:59.044
and in my case,
it was Leighton Meister's
dogwalker,

56:59.919 --> 57:01.628
but being a big city socialite

57:01.629 --> 57:03.672
is not the only
appropriate way to be gay.

57:03.673 --> 57:05.549
[Coach Reese] Yeah,
I mean, Susan over there?

- Remember when
we used to be best friends?

And then I told
the entire school
that you flashed my dad

my parents got a divorce?

could not handle the fact
that my parents
were splitting up,

01:01:11.421 --> 01:01:13.630

waiting to say.

[Ethan] This is your moment.
Tell the world who you are.

01:02:05.517 --> 01:02:06.726
Okay.

01:02:09.479 --> 01:02:10.480
Just gonna...

Oh. I should've
saw that coming.

Yeah... Uh, Pal-- Palmer?

01:02:25.495 --> 01:02:28.080
I think France is overrated.

inflicted around that age

follows you into adulthood,

01:02:51.479 --> 01:02:53.355
and it can really, really,
really, really mess you up

01:02:53.356 --> 01:02:56.191

the time to unpack it
and look inward.

a single close girlfriend
since that happened.

We haven't found them.

01:03:45.784 --> 01:03:47.452
Yeah, the door's locked.
What do we do?

01:03:49.704 --> 01:03:53.290
And I think that I should be
verified on social media

01:03:53.291 --> 01:03:55.376

01:03:55.377 --> 01:03:57.419

to stand up for yourself

01:04:47.554 --> 01:04:49.346
is to mug a woman in a bar?

01:04:49.347 --> 01:04:52.266
I had to.
She had a photo of us kissing.

01:04:52.267 --> 01:04:54.476
If Claire saw that,
she would have
hated me forever.

01:04:54.477 --> 01:04:58.188

are more important
than being the nice guy.

01:04:58.189 --> 01:05:00.024
And maybe
if you understood that,

01:05:00.025 --> 01:05:03.360
you wouldn't let people
walk all over you
and fuck up your life.

01:05:03.361 --> 01:05:05.363
You know
who's fucking up my life?

01:05:06.322 --> 01:05:08.365
You're fucking up my life.

I am so tired of you
yelling at me.

Maybe I care too much

But you don't care at all.

01:05:17.083 --> 01:05:19.126
You start fights
with strangers on the bus.

01:05:19.127 --> 01:05:20.711
You're mean to your roommate,

01:05:20.712 --> 01:05:23.380
who, on all accounts,
is an extremely sweet person.

01:05:23.381 --> 01:05:26.050
And fine,
I'm a pushover, Jamie.

01:05:26.051 --> 01:05:28.927
But at least
I'm not lying to myself

01:05:28.928 --> 01:05:32.056

like I hate everyone,
when clearly,

01:05:32.057 --> 01:05:34.726
I'm just desperate
to be accepted by them.

Yeah. And where are
Simon and Claire?

01:06:28.154 --> 01:06:29.697
It's a really
funny story, actually.

has a queer bowling league.

- What?
- It's like regular bowling,
but the people are gay.

01:06:37.122 --> 01:06:38.914
Anyway, Sam and Claire,

01:06:38.915 --> 01:06:41.959
ugh, they chugged
an entire bottle of absinthe
like animals.

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.377
And then they fled.

01:06:43.378 --> 01:06:45.671
And so they were briefly loose
in the town.

01:06:45.672 --> 01:06:47.840
But I captured them,
mostly on my own,

01:06:47.841 --> 01:06:50.009

back safely at my home.

No, they're not.
We were just there.
They're not there.

could have died back there."

01:09:38.219 --> 01:09:40.554
I had to turn in my deposit
before break.

01:09:40.555 --> 01:09:43.682
I was gonna tell you
after this weekend, but...

01:09:43.683 --> 01:09:46.143
Why don't I...
Why don't I run inside
and get us some drinks?

01:09:46.144 --> 01:09:47.311
Yeah. One step ahead of ya.

01:09:47.312 --> 01:09:48.562
Wait, wait, wait. Jamie, Jamie.

01:09:48.563 --> 01:09:49.980
Can we please talk about this?

01:09:49.981 --> 01:09:50.899
No.

01:09:52.984 --> 01:09:54.777
You should go to Copenhagen

01:09:54.778 --> 01:09:56.653
and have a great time
making friends

01:09:56.654 --> 01:10:00.324
who aren't as desperate as me.

01:10:00.325 --> 01:10:01.659
So, have fun.

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:09.667
[chuckles] Come on--
This is not my fault.

01:10:09.668 --> 01:10:10.627
Ben.

01:10:12.379 --> 01:10:16.173
I'm telling you,
the people at Harvard
fucking suck at beer pong.

01:10:16.174 --> 01:10:17.716
They are really nice, though.

01:10:17.717 --> 01:10:19.469
I'm liking my time there,
for sure.

01:10:20.637 --> 01:10:22.638
[chuckles] Hey, there she is!

01:10:22.639 --> 01:10:24.139
- Hi, babe!
- Come here.

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.516
I'm know. This night.

01:10:25.517 --> 01:10:26.850
Yeah, I'm so sorry.

01:10:26.851 --> 01:10:28.686
- My phone died at the game.
- It's okay.

01:10:28.687 --> 01:10:30.562
We went to Palmer's,
but it was kind of weird.

01:10:30.563 --> 01:10:32.064
And then I got lost
with Claire.

01:10:32.065 --> 01:10:34.191
It doesn't matter.
I fucking I missed your face.

01:10:34.192 --> 01:10:35.442
Hi. Oh.

01:10:35.443 --> 01:10:37.528
- Oh...
- God, I missed you.

01:10:37.529 --> 01:10:38.862
All right, boys, she's here.
Rack 'em.

01:10:38.863 --> 01:10:40.239
Oh, actually, um, I was--

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:42.282
I was hoping
we could go talk somewhere?

01:10:42.283 --> 01:10:44.451
Come on. I need my partner.

01:10:44.452 --> 01:10:45.703
One game. Just one. One game.

01:10:45.704 --> 01:10:49.039
Okay. All right.
One game. Yeah.

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.584
[indistinct chatter]

01:10:52.961 --> 01:10:55.337
I've been waiting all night
for you to be inside me.

01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:57.089
Oh, me too!

01:10:57.090 --> 01:10:58.508
Hi. Mm...

01:11:02.012 --> 01:11:03.929
[chuckles] You taste weird.

01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:04.888
Did you cheat on me?

01:11:04.889 --> 01:11:07.141
[laughs nervously]

01:11:07.142 --> 01:11:09.059
Oh, what?

01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:10.060
Um... [clears throat]

01:11:10.061 --> 01:11:11.854
So, should we go somewhere?

01:11:11.855 --> 01:11:13.397
My thoughts exactly.

01:11:13.398 --> 01:11:15.482
I already found a bedroom
upstairs with a waterbed.

01:11:15.483 --> 01:11:17.736
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Not a... not a bedroom.

01:11:18.611 --> 01:11:20.529
I... I mean, like,

01:11:20.530 --> 01:11:22.824
what about somewhere private,

01:11:23.950 --> 01:11:25.784
but also public?

01:11:25.785 --> 01:11:26.827
And outside?

01:11:26.828 --> 01:11:27.870
[chuckles]

01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:29.038
Freaky.

01:11:29.039 --> 01:11:31.123
Okay, college boy.

01:11:31.124 --> 01:11:33.001
- I know just the spot.
- Okay.

01:11:34.252 --> 01:11:36.463
[indistinct chatter]

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.346
Who's "Jet Aime"?

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.474
It's French. <i>Je t'aime.</i>

01:11:48.516 --> 01:11:49.892
What does <i>Je t'aime</i> mean?

01:11:49.893 --> 01:11:50.894
I love you.

01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:52.437
What?

01:11:53.021 --> 01:11:53.938
Go away.

01:12:00.403 --> 01:12:02.154
- Get over here.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

01:12:02.155 --> 01:12:03.490
Heh.

01:12:05.575 --> 01:12:08.285
No, no, no, no.
Whoa, whoa! I, um...
[clears throat] Claire.

01:12:08.286 --> 01:12:12.247
Uh, before we do anything,
I just want to talk to you.

01:12:12.248 --> 01:12:13.457
We can talk after.

01:12:13.458 --> 01:12:15.793
- This first.
- No, no. Um, it's...

01:12:15.794 --> 01:12:19.422
It's... it's about
something... serious.

01:12:20.465 --> 01:12:21.633
What is it?

01:12:23.635 --> 01:12:24.844
The permafrost.

01:12:26.763 --> 01:12:28.681
Yo, let's roast this fucker.

01:12:28.682 --> 01:12:31.517
Yeah, baby,
I'll be right there.

01:12:31.518 --> 01:12:33.812
["To The Party"
playing on speakers]

01:12:37.482 --> 01:12:39.316
You know anything
about cooking?

01:12:39.317 --> 01:12:40.902
Uh... not really.

01:12:42.028 --> 01:12:43.363
Wait, Kurt.

01:12:45.031 --> 01:12:46.157
I'm gay.

01:12:47.158 --> 01:12:48.492
I'm Kurt.

01:12:48.493 --> 01:12:49.993
I know.

01:12:49.994 --> 01:12:51.745
We've gone to school together
since kindergarten.

01:12:51.746 --> 01:12:54.541
I'm gonna try to cook
this turkey on that bonfire.

01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:56.501
Perfect.

01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:03.424
[groans]

01:13:03.425 --> 01:13:05.092
Ugh! We lost.

01:13:05.093 --> 01:13:07.845
I guess we should, uh,
go outside and talk now, huh?

01:13:07.846 --> 01:13:10.056
- Redemption shot. Come on.
- [groans]

01:13:10.974 --> 01:13:12.016
Babe, babe.

01:13:12.017 --> 01:13:14.184
- Come on! Overtime! Let's go!
- Babe!

01:13:14.185 --> 01:13:15.894
- Come on! I thought
we were gonna go talk.
- Yes!

01:13:15.895 --> 01:13:18.106
No, yeah, we are.
After this game.

01:13:19.524 --> 01:13:21.526
All right. You go.
You got this.

01:13:24.696 --> 01:13:27.031
- [ball bounces away]
- Whoops!

01:13:27.032 --> 01:13:29.491
[Simon] You used to be,
like, good at this.

01:13:29.492 --> 01:13:31.535
Gotta keep your elbow tucked.
Come on!

01:13:31.536 --> 01:13:33.204
[all exclaiming]

01:13:33.997 --> 01:13:35.330
Oh, my God!

01:13:35.331 --> 01:13:36.457
Ooh! Crazy!

01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:37.958
What the hell?

01:13:37.959 --> 01:13:40.420
We should probably go talk
while they fix that, huh?

01:13:40.879 --> 01:13:41.879
Okay.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:43.672
More like table wrecker!
Am I right?

01:13:43.673 --> 01:13:45.174
[girl] Oh, my God, Megan!

01:13:45.175 --> 01:13:48.010
No, no, it's funny now,
'cause we're friends.

01:13:48.011 --> 01:13:50.055
[indistinct chatter]

01:13:54.684 --> 01:13:56.226
[Palmer] Where's
she gonna do it?

01:13:56.227 --> 01:13:57.562
Not the swing set.

01:13:58.313 --> 01:13:59.439
He'll never swing again.

01:14:01.149 --> 01:14:02.232
Palmer.

01:14:02.233 --> 01:14:03.650
Hi.

01:14:03.651 --> 01:14:04.860
- [Palmer laughs] Hey.
- Hey.

01:14:04.861 --> 01:14:05.904
Lukas.

01:14:07.572 --> 01:14:09.114
Do you know Kurt?

01:14:09.115 --> 01:14:11.909
Uh, Coach and Ethan felt bad
that I had to miss bowling,

01:14:11.910 --> 01:14:14.078
and they said
you might still be out.

01:14:14.079 --> 01:14:15.580
So, that's...

01:14:16.247 --> 01:14:17.581
So you came to see me?

01:14:17.582 --> 01:14:18.792
[chuckles softly] Yeah.

01:14:20.752 --> 01:14:23.963
Okay. Well...
welcome to Kurt's party.

01:14:24.673 --> 01:14:26.423
[boys exclaiming]

01:14:26.424 --> 01:14:29.677
I take absolutely no ownership

01:14:29.678 --> 01:14:30.969
over anything
that's happening here.

01:14:30.970 --> 01:14:33.472
- Yeah.
- [laughs] Obviously.

01:14:33.473 --> 01:14:36.934
Do you want to grab a drink
and watch some stoned boys

01:14:36.935 --> 01:14:38.769
try to cook a turkey
over an open flame?

01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:41.147
[chuckles] Yeah, lead the way.

01:14:42.315 --> 01:14:43.525
Okay.

01:14:49.072 --> 01:14:52.241
And if the plankton and algae
communities are threatened,

01:14:52.242 --> 01:14:53.784
then... [scoffs]

01:14:53.785 --> 01:14:55.786
the entire food web may change.

01:14:55.787 --> 01:14:58.330
And... and, baby,
I appreciate your concern,

01:14:58.331 --> 01:15:00.958
but we're together
for the first time
in three months,

01:15:00.959 --> 01:15:04.420
and I really
don't want to talk about
plankton anymore.

01:15:04.421 --> 01:15:08.632
You know what
I do want to talk about,
Danny Zuko?

01:15:08.633 --> 01:15:10.634
Uh... methane levels.

01:15:10.635 --> 01:15:11.969
Let's talk about
methane levels.

01:15:11.970 --> 01:15:14.388
You're the one that I want.
[giggling]

01:15:14.389 --> 01:15:16.683
Okay, one sec.
One... one minute.

01:15:17.934 --> 01:15:19.393
Where the fuck are you going?

01:15:19.394 --> 01:15:21.563
I... I just need
some fresh air.

01:15:22.272 --> 01:15:23.648
We're literally outside.

01:15:24.733 --> 01:15:26.650
What's going on?

01:15:26.651 --> 01:15:27.901
Why are you being so weird?

01:15:27.902 --> 01:15:29.612
[Jamie and Simon
speaking indistinctly]

01:15:30.822 --> 01:15:32.531
What are you looking at?

01:15:32.532 --> 01:15:34.616
[Jamie] I just don't think
this long-distance thing
is working.

01:15:34.617 --> 01:15:37.996
It'll be way easier
for me to come visit
once football is over.

01:15:39.622 --> 01:15:40.999
I feel like you're just like...

01:15:42.167 --> 01:15:43.168
giving up.

01:15:43.585 --> 01:15:44.669
Is she...

01:15:45.503 --> 01:15:46.838
Are they...

01:15:47.422 --> 01:15:48.298
Wait a second.

01:15:51.259 --> 01:15:52.218
[scoffs]

01:15:53.845 --> 01:15:57.556
Was all that stuff
about a serious conversation

01:15:57.557 --> 01:15:59.768
you trying to break up
with me, too?

01:16:02.604 --> 01:16:03.937
[loudly] Oh, my God!

01:16:03.938 --> 01:16:06.190
Was this some plan
between the two of you?

01:16:06.191 --> 01:16:10.110
To tag team
your fucking breakups?

01:16:10.111 --> 01:16:12.946
- Ugh, God, you guys
do everything together!
- Claire...

01:16:12.947 --> 01:16:14.865
Don't even think
about following me!

01:16:14.866 --> 01:16:17.993
Uh, maybe we should go
somewhere else?

01:16:17.994 --> 01:16:21.372
- [Claire straining]
- Really, Claire?

01:16:21.373 --> 01:16:23.165
Don't fucking move!

01:16:23.166 --> 01:16:24.208
What is going on?

01:16:24.209 --> 01:16:26.251
[Claire] Let me save you
the confusion.

01:16:26.252 --> 01:16:28.671
These two came up
with a little plan
to dump us at the same time

01:16:28.672 --> 01:16:30.673
because they're
co-dependent psychos

01:16:30.674 --> 01:16:32.842
who can't do anything
without each other!

01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:34.886
Seriously?

01:16:35.804 --> 01:16:37.513
You two... You planned this?

01:16:37.514 --> 01:16:40.391
I bet it's exactly
what everyone's
been saying all along.

01:16:40.392 --> 01:16:44.228
That these two
have been at school
rawdogging the entire time!

01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:46.397
Ben and I are not
having sex with each other!

01:16:46.398 --> 01:16:48.065
Yeah. And to be honest,

01:16:48.066 --> 01:16:50.567
we're not exactly
on great terms
right now, either.

01:16:50.568 --> 01:16:52.236
Aw. Of course
you two are fighting.

01:16:52.237 --> 01:16:53.987
You're like
an old married couple.

01:16:53.988 --> 01:16:55.906
You might as well
be fucking at this point!

01:16:55.907 --> 01:16:58.075
Claire, this isn't
about Ben and I.

01:16:58.076 --> 01:17:00.035
This is about the fact
that these relationships

01:17:00.036 --> 01:17:01.578
should have been left
in high school.

01:17:01.579 --> 01:17:03.330
I'm sorry to say,

01:17:03.331 --> 01:17:06.333
but they're holding us all back
from moving on with our lives.

01:17:06.334 --> 01:17:08.544
Wait, you think
we're holding you back?

01:17:08.545 --> 01:17:09.920
Are Simon and I the reason

01:17:09.921 --> 01:17:11.630
you two stay in your dorm room
every night

01:17:11.631 --> 01:17:14.675
instead of making
a single new friend?

01:17:14.676 --> 01:17:17.012
You know what? This sucks.

01:17:17.679 --> 01:17:18.721
I'm done.

01:17:18.722 --> 01:17:19.847
- Simon.
- No.

01:17:19.848 --> 01:17:22.057
Simon. Simon.

01:17:22.058 --> 01:17:24.269
You two deserve each other.

01:17:28.231 --> 01:17:29.232
[Ben] Claire.

01:17:35.572 --> 01:17:37.281
Um...

01:17:37.282 --> 01:17:38.783
Not an emergency...

01:17:39.909 --> 01:17:41.870
but I am stuck up here.

01:17:44.122 --> 01:17:46.623
[indistinct chatter
and laughter]

01:17:46.624 --> 01:17:48.167
Oh, that doesn't look good.

01:17:48.168 --> 01:17:51.670
Yeah, that is definitely
way too much lighter fluid.

01:17:51.671 --> 01:17:53.922
[people exclaiming]

01:17:53.923 --> 01:17:57.009
[chanting] Turkey!
Turkey! Turkey!

01:17:57.010 --> 01:17:58.802
- [chanting continues]
- God.

01:17:58.803 --> 01:18:02.222
A group of straight guys
with a common goal
is genuinely terrifying.

I know. I mean,
granted, we do spend
too much time together.

01:28:24.429 --> 01:28:25.888
Yeah, it's fair to say
we have issues, but--

01:28:25.889 --> 01:28:28.767

is not one of them.

about Copenhagen.

01:28:37.067 --> 01:28:40.861

it has nothing to do
with you or Claire

01:28:40.862 --> 01:28:43.572
or anything other than the fact
that I want to go.

01:28:43.573 --> 01:28:45.533
I think it's cool
my professor picked me.

01:28:47.786 --> 01:28:49.244
It is cool.

01:28:49.245 --> 01:28:51.413
- Really?
- Yeah, of course, really.

01:28:51.414 --> 01:28:52.915
It's been cool this whole time.

01:28:52.916 --> 01:28:54.667
I just...
didn't want to admit it

01:28:54.668 --> 01:28:56.586
because I didn't
want you to leave.

01:28:57.962 --> 01:28:58.879

01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:01.591
and I am
really excited for you.

01:29:02.926 --> 01:29:04.843
And you're right,
I should be nicer to Kelly.

01:29:04.844 --> 01:29:06.595
I know what I said
about sororities,

01:29:06.596 --> 01:29:09.349

girlfriends in college.

01:29:14.062 --> 01:29:16.689
Oh, yeah, I was looking to see
if there's any wisdom in here

01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:18.399
about making out
with your best friend

01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:20.275
and then deeply regretting it.

01:29:20.276 --> 01:29:21.944
- Ah. And?
- Nothing yet.

01:29:21.945 --> 01:29:24.489
But to be fair,
I am still on the foreword.

01:29:26.449 --> 01:29:27.366

01:29:27.367 --> 01:29:28.492
No.

01:29:28.493 --> 01:29:29.868
You talk to Claire?

01:29:29.869 --> 01:29:31.787
No, not yet.
We should probably do that.

01:29:31.788 --> 01:29:33.580
Yeah, we should.

01:29:33.581 --> 01:29:35.166

that we kissed?

01:29:37.961 --> 01:29:39.795
