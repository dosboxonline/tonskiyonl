00:02.875 --> 00:04.624
[Silvo] Because, at long last,
I've brought you

00:04.625 --> 00:06.915
to the only thing that matters.

00:06.916 --> 00:10.291
Cold, hard credits.

00:12.291 --> 00:16.125
If you ever need help,
you can call me anytime.

00:16.666 --> 00:19.082
Because the starship
is outside the Barrier,

00:19.083 --> 00:22.041
<i>the Supervisor is unable
to risk any contact.</i>

00:22.625 --> 00:25.499
We're gonna be in so much trouble.
But I don't even care anymore.

00:25.500 --> 00:27.916
- [Jod] But you should.
- [lightsaber ignites]

00:29.250 --> 00:30.291
[shouting] Get on the ground!

00:30.875 --> 00:34.332
You're all weak.
Sheltered, spoiled children.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.874
So, we're gonna land,

00:36.875 --> 00:38.582
<i>I'm gonna contact the frigate.</i>

00:38.583 --> 00:40.666
<i>And you lot are not gonna say a word.</i>

00:41.166 --> 00:43.874
Now, I need open communication
with my other ship.

00:43.875 --> 00:47.457
You must speak with the Supervisor
about the Barrier, Emissary.

00:47.458 --> 00:51.457
[Jod] <i>I enjoyed
seeing your parents' faces.</i>

00:51.458 --> 00:54.583
<i>Makes it very easy for me
to know who to carve up.</i>

01:00.125 --> 01:02.125
[♪ gentle music playing]

01:20.291 --> 01:22.291
[music ends]

01:22.916 --> 01:24.583
[lightsaber ignites]

01:27.291 --> 01:28.457
[breath trembles]

01:28.458 --> 01:31.416
[Maree] Emissary, how can we thank you?

01:31.916 --> 01:36.791
[Jod] Reuniting families
is all part of what I do.

01:38.916 --> 01:42.082
Jod Na Nawood, at your service.

01:42.083 --> 01:44.125
[♪ tense music playing]

01:45.625 --> 01:46.875
[Fara] Are they in any trouble?

01:48.625 --> 01:50.125
I'm afraid they are.

01:51.208 --> 01:52.874
Stealing a ship.

01:52.875 --> 01:56.666
Breaking just about
every security protocol.

01:57.166 --> 02:01.374
At Attin and its safety
should be your top, top priority.

02:01.375 --> 02:03.665
I take full responsibility.

02:03.666 --> 02:05.624
Thank you again.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.832
We don't want to interfere
with your Offloading duties...

02:07.833 --> 02:10.290
Confine them to their quarters.

02:10.291 --> 02:14.083
And I want these droids
to keep an eye on them

02:14.583 --> 02:16.957
and report back to me on their behavior.

02:16.958 --> 02:18.665
Yes, Emissary.

02:18.666 --> 02:19.999
Is that totally necessary?

02:20.000 --> 02:22.041
Yeah, I'm afraid it is. I insist.

02:22.541 --> 02:24.625
These are serious violations.

02:25.791 --> 02:29.624
[chuckling] I got to see firsthand
just how troublesome

02:29.625 --> 02:31.583
they could be
on our little adventure home.

02:32.166 --> 02:33.333
- Didn't I, Wim?
- [Fern] Yeah,

02:34.833 --> 02:37.416
we were way too troublesome.

02:40.583 --> 02:42.041
[softly] Come on, let's go.

02:42.541 --> 02:43.624
- [Wendle] Come on.
- All right.

02:43.625 --> 02:47.416
Uh, perhaps young Fern here
would like to accompany me

02:48.250 --> 02:49.833
to meet the Supervisor.

02:51.625 --> 02:55.624
And learn something
about duty, responsibility.

02:55.625 --> 02:57.290
[Fara] Of course. I should accompany her.

02:57.291 --> 02:58.707
[Jod] Certainly.

02:58.708 --> 03:02.208
I'll take special care of both of you.

03:27.458 --> 03:28.750
[Wendle] Mm.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.458
Mm. Nothing like a home-cooked meal.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.958
Bet you missed these
while you were out there, huh?

03:35.916 --> 03:36.916
[Wim sighs]

03:40.375 --> 03:43.707
Of course, I'm gonna have to talk
to the Proctor so you can take Assessment.

03:43.708 --> 03:45.915
[scoffs] That doesn't matter anymore.

03:45.916 --> 03:47.250
Doesn't matter? Are you--

03:48.208 --> 03:51.957
[sighs] You didn't learn your lesson
from your little space joyride?

03:51.958 --> 03:53.165
You are in big trouble, mister!

03:53.166 --> 03:55.665
- No. Dad, that's not what I meant--
- If you don't get assessed,

03:55.666 --> 03:57.290
- how are you gonna have a career?
- Dad.

03:57.291 --> 03:58.749
How will you be part
of the Great Work?

03:58.750 --> 04:00.790
There's a lot more to the galaxy
than the Great Work!

04:00.791 --> 04:02.790
You think I didn't wanna just...
[stuttering] take off

04:02.791 --> 04:05.166
- and meet a Jedi? And--
- He's not even a--

04:09.833 --> 04:11.083
[breathing heavily]

04:13.083 --> 04:14.166
I'm sorry.

04:16.875 --> 04:18.583
I saw places out there

04:19.750 --> 04:22.083
that made me get how good home is.

04:23.291 --> 04:24.291
It's just...

04:29.375 --> 04:30.958
There are certain people

04:31.958 --> 04:33.791
from out there

04:34.625 --> 04:35.958
who want to ruin it.

04:42.375 --> 04:44.291
Well, that's what the Supervisor's for.

04:50.625 --> 04:54.290
Meeting the Supervisor, at your age,
it's an incredible honor.

04:54.291 --> 04:57.249
[inhales sharply]
Just be sure to make a good impression.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.000
- Don't slouch.
- Mom.

05:05.916 --> 05:07.332
- [radio static]
- Neel, where are you?

05:07.333 --> 05:08.665
Neel, I need help. Where are you?

05:08.666 --> 05:11.124
[Neel on radio] <i>I'm home.
But I'm being watched by the droids.</i>

05:11.125 --> 05:13.374
<i>I-I can't talk or Jod will know!</i>

05:13.375 --> 05:14.874
<i>I... I gotta go.</i>

05:14.875 --> 05:18.332
No, Neel. Neel? We need to save Fern.
Neel. Please help.

05:18.333 --> 05:21.582
[Safety Droid] All communication
will be reported to the Emissary.

05:21.583 --> 05:23.791
Who are you speaking to?

05:24.666 --> 05:26.083
- [radio beeps]
- [Wim grunts]

05:29.250 --> 05:31.290
[mimicking] Oh, come on.
We need to save Princess Fern.

05:31.291 --> 05:33.125
Oh, okay, Wim. Okay.
[continues mimicking]

05:49.916 --> 05:50.915
[Fara clears throat]

05:50.916 --> 05:52.082
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

05:52.083 --> 05:53.166
[Fara] Hello?

05:54.916 --> 05:56.250
Come this way. Come on.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.499
Supervisor?

05:59.500 --> 06:00.583
Hello?

06:02.875 --> 06:04.000
Hello?

06:06.875 --> 06:07.875
[door closes]

06:16.000 --> 06:17.040
Is it abandoned?

06:17.041 --> 06:18.583
[Fara] No, it's just--

06:19.250 --> 06:23.333
You see, the Supervisor so rarely
grants an audience.

06:24.166 --> 06:25.291
[device powering up]

06:28.416 --> 06:31.874
Is that Undersecretary Fara I see?

06:31.875 --> 06:35.040
One of my most dedicated citizens.

06:35.041 --> 06:39.915
I have been watching over you
and your daughter with great interest.

06:39.916 --> 06:43.833
And I'm pleased to see
she has been safely returned.

06:45.166 --> 06:46.541
You're ruled by a droid?

06:47.791 --> 06:49.707
As decreed by the Great Work.

06:49.708 --> 06:51.957
And I see a new face.

06:51.958 --> 06:54.374
Please, introduce yourself.

06:54.375 --> 06:57.415
Greetings, Supervisor.

06:57.416 --> 07:00.249
- [breathing heavily]
- I am Jod Na Nawood.

07:00.250 --> 07:03.707
Emissary for the Republic. And Jedi.

07:03.708 --> 07:05.165
Greetings.

07:05.166 --> 07:06.250
[softly] It's a trick.

07:07.791 --> 07:11.290
[Supervisor] I must admit,
I began to doubt an Emissary

07:11.291 --> 07:14.541
would ever visit our humble Mint again.

07:15.625 --> 07:17.457
Indeed. Our apologies.

07:17.458 --> 07:19.415
[blows raspberry]
We've had our hands full.

07:19.416 --> 07:20.707
You understand.

07:20.708 --> 07:25.332
Thwarting the many evil schemes
to destroy the Republic.

07:25.333 --> 07:26.915
The Republic...

07:26.916 --> 07:31.790
My, the outside galaxy
is so dangerously unstable.

07:31.791 --> 07:34.999
Oh, yes. Now, as Emissary,
I need my other ship,

07:35.000 --> 07:37.249
currently in orbit
beyond the Great Barrier.

07:37.250 --> 07:39.624
Why doesn't your second ship
simply land as you did?

07:39.625 --> 07:42.791
You ask too many questions
of your Emissary.

07:43.750 --> 07:45.375
What you need to do right now...

07:46.333 --> 07:47.332
is obey.

07:47.333 --> 07:49.207
[Supervisor] Well said.

07:49.208 --> 07:51.415
Strict obedience to authority

07:51.416 --> 07:55.374
has kept At Attin running smoothly
for generations.

07:55.375 --> 08:00.957
Your other ship may land
if you can clear up one tiny detail.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.582
You see, the last message
from the Republic

08:03.583 --> 08:07.040
stated that all Jedi were traitors.

08:07.041 --> 08:09.832
So, which are you lying about?

08:09.833 --> 08:12.416
Being an Emissary or a Jedi?

08:14.083 --> 08:16.040
He's a pirate trying to invade the Mint!

08:16.041 --> 08:17.707
As I suspected.

08:17.708 --> 08:20.541
- Seize the impostor!

Fern, bring your mummy up to speed.

08:56.958 --> 08:58.333
[power whooshing]

09:22.708 --> 09:24.666
How do I bring my other ship
through the Barrier?

09:26.083 --> 09:27.083
Hmm?

09:28.208 --> 09:30.500
- Barrier override...
- [button beeps]

09:31.333 --> 09:32.333

09:34.541 --> 09:36.707
No. You can't.

09:36.708 --> 09:39.207
[chuckling] You no longer
issue orders here.

09:39.208 --> 09:40.999
No, this will destroy the Barrier.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.250
It's essential to our survival.

09:43.958 --> 09:45.915
[stutters] I can give your ship
access instead.

09:45.916 --> 09:48.166
- Mom!
- Fern, I'll handle this.

09:50.958 --> 09:54.041
I don't want to destroy anything.
I just want to land my ship.

09:55.125 --> 09:57.915
We'll take our fill of credits,
and we'll go.

09:57.916 --> 10:00.249
You'll never see us again.
No one will get hurt.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.457
He's lying. He's gonna stay
and he's gonna try to--

10:17.833 --> 10:18.875
[Fara whimpers]

10:21.000 --> 10:22.291
Mom, don't tell him.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.125
I'll show you. [exhales]

Don't worry. It's just a power outage.

Looks like the whole block's out.

but now I can finally tell you.

11:17.583 --> 11:19.832
Jod's a bad guy. He's lying.

He didn't save us. He's trying to get us!

Okay, then we'll go on foot.
Somewhere safe.

12:42.416 --> 12:44.707
We can't just run away! He's got Fern!

- The Safety Droids that are all off? No!

- Do you think Fern's okay?

12:59.750 --> 13:03.249
I don't know, but Jod must have done
something to the Supervisor.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.790
- So we have to call for help.
- But how?

13:05.791 --> 13:08.874
Remember on the hotel planet?
The X-wings chased the pirates away.

13:08.875 --> 13:12.207
And Kh'ymm, the bird lady
from the telescope moon, knows 'em.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.957
So we get to the ship,
fly out past the Barrier,

13:14.958 --> 13:16.208
and call her for help.

13:16.916 --> 13:21.040
So, we blast off, call the real good guys,

13:21.041 --> 13:22.332
and beat the pirates!

13:22.333 --> 13:25.165
- But we gotta hurry!
- Okay. Let's do this!
