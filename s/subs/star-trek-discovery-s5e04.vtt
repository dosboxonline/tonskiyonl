Some things are hard
to move past, for both of us.

to say that out loud.

No, but we found a clue

-It's all we could do
last-minute.
-Yeah.

01:54.288 --> 01:56.854
This'll cover the original cost,

01:56.899 --> 01:58.466
but, uh, the price

laying low for now.

05:16.403 --> 05:17.795
If I were them,

05:17.839 --> 05:19.797
I'd let Discovery
lead us to the next clue,

in the meantime.

If they were following us,

05:22.887 --> 05:24.715
we'd have evidence of that
right here, right now,

05:24.759 --> 05:26.108
but we don't.

05:26.151 --> 05:27.762

to the facts, Commander.

Can I speak to you
in my ready room, please?

Unacceptable.

05:44.082 --> 05:45.736
Not how we do things here.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.391

be engaged and involved

05:51.046 --> 05:53.004

This is a Red Directive

You don't think my crew
is disciplined?

too comfortable

06:10.239 --> 06:12.067

to these same spots.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.769
Can't be a time eddy.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.249
We would have
seen that on scans.

13:35.292 --> 13:36.728
Doesn't feel like
a neural attack.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.165
So, it has to be something
with the ship.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.254
What are we missing?

13:40.297 --> 13:43.953
Shit. It's a time bug.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.607
What?

13:47.217 --> 13:49.176
Krenim chronophage.

13:49.219 --> 13:51.700
We call them time bugs. You can
find them in the black market

13:51.743 --> 13:53.702
left over from the Temporal War.

13:53.745 --> 13:55.399
They're designed
to paralyze an enemy ship

13:55.443 --> 13:57.401
by randomly cycling them
through time.

13:57.445 --> 13:59.316
-How long do they last?
-Weeks, months,

13:59.360 --> 14:01.449
until the little suckers
run out of juice.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.059
That's why we can't
beam anywhere.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.192
The whole point
is to keep us stuck.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.628
This has to be Moll and L'ak.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.195
How the hell
did they get it on board?

14:08.238 --> 14:09.805
They must have made it
to Trill somehow

14:09.849 --> 14:11.502
and crossed paths
with one of you.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.417
Owosekun did say there was
an unauthorized broadcast.

14:13.461 --> 14:14.941
Right, that'd be
the location beacon.

14:14.984 --> 14:16.072
So, they know
exactly where we are

14:16.116 --> 14:17.508
and where the next clue is.

14:17.552 --> 14:19.597
Rhys was right.

14:19.641 --> 14:22.731
We cannot let them get what
the Progenitors left behind.

14:22.774 --> 14:25.995
So, we have to find
and deactivate this bug.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.867
My guess, it's in engineering,

14:27.910 --> 14:30.434
but even if we do find it,
who knows how long we have.

14:30.478 --> 14:32.088
Well, there must be a pattern
to the time cycle lengths.

14:32.132 --> 14:34.656
If we use this to track them,
we figure it out.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.005
Right now,

14:36.049 --> 14:39.182
-we need to find Stamets.
-What can he do?

14:39.226 --> 14:41.097
Well, he lives outside of time
because of his tardigrade DNA.

14:41.141 --> 14:42.882
Uh...

14:42.925 --> 14:44.709
Nevermind.

14:44.753 --> 14:47.103
He should be within the cycle
lengths like everyone else,

14:47.147 --> 14:48.626
but just as aware of it
as we are.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.237
He may have already
figured it out.

14:50.280 --> 14:52.108
Any idea where he'd be?

14:52.152 --> 14:53.501
-MALE: Dr. Pollard, over here!
-NURSE: What about the injured

-You've been impaled, Paul.

You should be in

No, you can't do that. Zora?

-No.

No, no.
I-I need to get out of here.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.095
I need to find a way
out of this.

15:22.138 --> 15:23.487
You're not going anywhere.
You need to rest.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.968
No, Hugh, I need to help.

-Not sure yet,

but I do know
that last cycle lasted

15:48.338 --> 15:50.688
twice as long
as the one before it.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.693
Hope this one's even longer.

-Right. Any change in our past

-Exactly.

25:34.097 --> 25:35.925
-Yes, sir.
-Go, go!

25:35.969 --> 25:37.187
Go!

25:42.889 --> 25:44.281
How are you two even here?

25:44.325 --> 25:46.283
We were beaming
when the cycling started.

25:46.327 --> 25:48.242
And we get sent back to
the ready room after each reset.

25:48.285 --> 25:51.071
I am so happy to see you
I could cry.

25:51.114 --> 25:53.377
I'm so happy to see you, too.

25:53.421 --> 25:55.031
-Have you had any problems?
-No, no, no, no, no.

25:55.075 --> 25:57.381
I've just been, uh,
repeating my past actions,

25:57.425 --> 25:59.601
some of which have been
deeply unpleasant.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.472
But I did get to see

26:01.516 --> 26:03.692
Linus stuck
in the replicator again.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.041
Always a silver lining.

26:05.085 --> 26:06.260
Yeah. Well, listen,

26:06.303 --> 26:07.566
we know what's causing this.

26:07.609 --> 26:09.045
It's some kind of a time bug.

26:09.089 --> 26:11.482
Yeah, aptly named,
and I know where it is.

26:11.526 --> 26:14.834
Yeah, it embedded itself in the
power distribution subsystem.

26:14.877 --> 26:17.140
-Okay, so let's wrench it out...
-STAMETS: Oh, no, no, no.

26:17.184 --> 26:19.882
Easy now, it's not that simple.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.492
If removed improperly,

26:21.536 --> 26:24.539
incalculable timelines
might converge at once,

26:24.583 --> 26:27.977
ripping every molecule around
us into infinite directions,

26:28.021 --> 26:30.545
over and over again,
for eternity.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.068
Sounds bad.

26:32.112 --> 26:33.548
How do we fix it?

26:33.592 --> 26:36.116
Well, uh, we have to
nullify its effects

26:36.159 --> 26:38.118
with near-perfect precision.

26:38.161 --> 26:40.120
And to do that,
I need to be able to

26:40.163 --> 26:42.209
understand the pattern
of the resets.

26:42.252 --> 26:45.604
But I've been so busy trying
not to change the future

26:45.647 --> 26:47.562
that I haven't been able
to record the timings.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.433
That's okay.
Got them right here.

26:49.477 --> 26:50.826
You do?

26:50.870 --> 26:52.698
Takes a village.

26:54.047 --> 26:56.049
STAMETS:
Oh, wow. This is great, yeah.

26:56.092 --> 26:58.181
I can now build
a chroniton stabilizer

26:58.225 --> 27:00.923
and properly calibrate it
to stop this mess.

27:00.967 --> 27:03.317
But I may just need some help
gathering equipment.

27:03.360 --> 27:05.014
But the next cycle
is ending in ten seconds.

27:05.058 --> 27:08.496
Okay, from now on, we meet on
Deck 13 after each reset.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.411
-Got it.
-And Paul, we saw

27:10.454 --> 27:13.196
our possible future.
We can't let it happen.

27:13.240 --> 27:14.589
We cannot fail.

27:21.248 --> 27:23.642
Okay, so, the next reset
is in eight minutes.

27:23.685 --> 27:25.426
So let's be quick.

27:25.469 --> 27:27.689
The good news is that this
timeline has everything I need

27:27.733 --> 27:29.343
to make a chroniton stabilizer.

27:29.386 --> 27:31.519
-Great.
-And the bad news?

27:31.562 --> 27:33.652
The main ingredient
is a field-disrupter fluid

27:33.695 --> 27:36.698
that's in 32nd century
holodecks. And...

27:36.742 --> 27:37.960
At around this time,
the holodeck in my quarters

27:38.004 --> 27:39.527
would have just been installed.

27:39.570 --> 27:42.095
I can go so you don't
risk running into anyone.

27:42.138 --> 27:43.487
The captain's quarters
are biometrically secured.

27:43.531 --> 27:44.837
It has to be me.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.578
Let's do it now.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.058
Don't know when
we'll be able to again.

27:49.102 --> 27:51.539
-In that case, be safe.
-And fast.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.236
Meet you in engineering.

28:07.903 --> 28:09.209
[sighs]

28:21.047 --> 28:23.527
[door whooshes open]

28:23.571 --> 28:25.268
Hey.

28:25.312 --> 28:27.096
I thought you would have
been on the bridge.

28:27.140 --> 28:29.098
I would have grabbed you
a raktajino

28:29.142 --> 28:30.796
on my way back from the gym.

28:30.839 --> 28:32.885
Yeah, I had to pop back.

28:34.321 --> 28:37.150
But I should go.

28:37.193 --> 28:40.719
Um, I've got to be somewhere in
four and a half minutes, so...

28:40.762 --> 28:43.243
Very precise, Michael.

28:43.286 --> 28:45.811
You know me.
Precise.

28:45.854 --> 28:46.855
You okay?

28:46.899 --> 28:49.684
Yeah.
No, oh, yeah.

28:49.728 --> 28:51.294
Yeah, I'm okay.

28:51.338 --> 28:52.339
It's a lot
of new responsibilities,

28:52.382 --> 28:53.688
becoming the captain.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.386
Mm-hmm.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.693
Trust your instinct.

28:58.737 --> 29:00.782
You were made for this.

29:02.262 --> 29:05.134
Change can be hard.

29:05.178 --> 29:09.008
It's also the only way anything
meaningful can happen.

29:10.792 --> 29:13.055
Uh, can we
talk about this later?

29:13.099 --> 29:15.405
Um... Yeah?

29:21.847 --> 29:24.023
Love you.

29:28.070 --> 29:29.419
I love you.

29:33.467 --> 29:35.164
[door whooshes open]

29:39.865 --> 29:41.518
Nice and quiet.

29:41.562 --> 29:42.998
He cleared it
with another spore breach.

29:43.042 --> 29:44.521
STAMETS:
Yeah, I'm a little disturbed

29:44.565 --> 29:45.914
that my crew doesn't know
that isn't a real thing.

29:45.958 --> 29:48.699
Not much time.
Next reset's 45 seconds.

29:48.743 --> 29:49.788
ALL:
Get out!

29:53.226 --> 29:54.314
Okay.

29:55.663 --> 29:58.840
This is ready.
You do the honors.

29:58.884 --> 30:01.016
Just put it right on the bug

30:01.060 --> 30:03.758
and we should be back
in our real time in a flash.

30:03.802 --> 30:05.629
Literally.

30:10.069 --> 30:11.113
Oh!

30:13.246 --> 30:14.638
What the hell is that?

30:14.682 --> 30:16.118
STAMETS:
Well, it's a defense mechanism

30:16.162 --> 30:18.773
of some kind.
A temporal shield, I think.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.993
Let's find out for sure.

30:25.171 --> 30:26.868
Uh, that's bad.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.348
Down to ten seconds.

30:28.391 --> 30:29.958
We got to figure this out.

30:30.002 --> 30:31.742
There's no way out
of this mess, otherwise.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.671
[door whooshes open]

30:47.715 --> 30:48.977
-What have you got?
-Okay,

30:49.021 --> 30:50.457
so, uh, the spanner
disintegrated

30:50.500 --> 30:52.851
because time
within the temporal shield

30:52.894 --> 30:54.983
is moving at an
ultra-accelerated rate.

30:55.027 --> 30:58.247
So anything-- including us--
ages to dust

30:58.291 --> 31:00.597
before it can actually
get to the bug itself.

31:00.641 --> 31:02.034
-Can we turn the shield off?
-No.

31:02.077 --> 31:03.644
But we can mitigate the effects

31:03.687 --> 31:05.994
long enough to get in
and deactivate it.

31:06.038 --> 31:08.779
We just need to allow
relativity to take over.

31:08.823 --> 31:11.957
By taking the ship
to maximum warp and then

31:12.000 --> 31:13.349
breaking the warp bubble.

31:13.393 --> 31:14.611
[short chuckle]

31:14.655 --> 31:16.570
What?

31:16.613 --> 31:18.659
Because that's what protects us
from the effects of relativity.

31:18.702 --> 31:20.400
We'll drop out of warp so fast

31:20.443 --> 31:22.968
that the time inside the shield
won't be able to keep up.

31:23.011 --> 31:25.927
Essentially, whatever went
into the shield in that moment

31:25.971 --> 31:27.886
would still age,
just not instantly.

31:27.929 --> 31:30.279
Well, wouldn't
the whiplash kill us

31:30.323 --> 31:32.934
or break the Discovery
into a million pieces?

31:32.978 --> 31:36.851
Well, the inertial dampeners
should prevent that. Hopefully.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.374
It's a big move.

31:38.418 --> 31:39.593
It'll definitely
change the future.

31:39.636 --> 31:41.073
No, not if we succeed.

31:41.116 --> 31:43.902
Because changes to any time
that we're in

31:43.945 --> 31:47.035
don't become permanent
until after the bug resets.

31:47.079 --> 31:48.950
So, as long as we break
the warp bubble

31:48.994 --> 31:51.431
and turn the bug off
within the same time cycle,

31:51.474 --> 31:53.259
everything will go back
to the way it was before.

31:53.302 --> 31:55.783
So we only have one shot.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.090
It's a risk we have to take.

31:58.133 --> 31:59.874
Let's do it now.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.528
This current time cycle
is the longest that we'll have

32:01.571 --> 32:03.008
in a while-- 14 minutes.

32:03.051 --> 32:04.226
Who's on the bridge?

32:04.270 --> 32:06.054
Okay, so it's, uh,

32:06.098 --> 32:08.491
right now Lorca's ship,

32:08.535 --> 32:11.233
but he's on an away mission
with Saru and Landry.

32:11.277 --> 32:13.540
So the duty roster
has Rhys on call.

32:13.583 --> 32:17.544
And we've got Detmer,
Owosekun, Bryce, Tilly,

32:17.587 --> 32:19.763
Chen, Sanchez...

32:21.504 --> 32:22.592
...and Airiam.

32:24.681 --> 32:26.205
Who's Airiam?

32:27.554 --> 32:30.513
She's an officer that didn't
make it to the future with us.

32:32.472 --> 32:34.648
We can do this.
We just have to do it together.

32:34.691 --> 32:37.129
But you're not their captain
in this time.

32:37.172 --> 32:40.132
You're a mutineer.
They're not gonna listen to you.

32:40.175 --> 32:42.134
I'll have to find a way.

32:42.177 --> 32:45.572
Okay, so, uh, I'll modulate
the inertial dampeners

32:45.615 --> 32:47.661
to keep the vibrations
from destroying the ship

32:47.704 --> 32:49.532
once we've broken
the warp bubble.

32:49.576 --> 32:52.535
Guess I'm the lucky one sticking
his hand in the spider's nest.

32:52.579 --> 32:54.798
Here. My communicator.
Just in case you need it.

32:54.842 --> 32:56.670
I'll grab a spare.

32:56.713 --> 32:59.412
We've got 13 minutes.
Let's make 'em count.

32:59.455 --> 33:01.370
[door whooshes open]

33:01.414 --> 33:02.893
Computer, bridge.

33:12.207 --> 33:14.253
[door whooshes closed]

33:16.603 --> 33:17.908
Mm. Mm.

33:19.084 --> 33:20.781
Uh... Mm.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.740
Let me just say...

33:25.916 --> 33:29.007
Red is definitely your color.

33:29.050 --> 33:31.096
-[chuckles]
-Mm.

33:31.139 --> 33:32.575
Thank you, Linus.

33:32.619 --> 33:34.229
Hm.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.414
-Computer! Security!
-No!

33:45.458 --> 33:47.068
Computer, belay that order.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.636
Computer, Deck 13.
We can talk down there.

33:49.679 --> 33:51.464
Wow. Hi.

33:51.507 --> 33:53.335
-Who the hell are you?
-Okay, okay.

33:53.379 --> 33:55.033
It's complicated.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.991
Oh, I was really hoping
that this wouldn't happen.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.559
But things rarely go as planned
for us, am I right?

34:00.821 --> 34:04.303
Okay. I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna explain it then.

34:04.346 --> 34:07.219
I am you from the future.

34:07.262 --> 34:09.134
And we are stuck... I-I...

34:09.177 --> 34:11.831
I'm stuck cycling through time

34:11.875 --> 34:13.094
because of a temporal weapon

34:13.138 --> 34:14.443
that is currently
in engineering.

34:14.487 --> 34:16.097
I do have a plan
to deactivate it,

34:16.141 --> 34:18.186
but I have very limited time
to do it,

34:18.230 --> 34:21.494
so please just let me proceed,

34:21.536 --> 34:23.103
and nothing needs to happen.

34:23.148 --> 34:25.976
I don't know if you're
a shapeshifter or what.

34:26.020 --> 34:28.630
But seeing the uniform,
you must think I'm an idiot

34:28.675 --> 34:30.416
if you expect me to believe
that a mutineer

34:30.458 --> 34:31.982
could ever end up
with captain's pips.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.768
No, no, no, no, no. Burnham,
you don't want to do that.

34:34.811 --> 34:35.899
You don't want to do that.

34:35.943 --> 34:39.380
Yeah. I really do.

34:39.425 --> 34:41.166
[grunting]

35:06.191 --> 35:08.106
Oh!

35:26.689 --> 35:28.735
Michael, I don't
want to hurt you.

35:39.049 --> 35:41.617
[panting]

35:41.661 --> 35:44.098
I know...

35:44.142 --> 35:45.926
that it's hard to see a path
to the captain's seat

35:45.969 --> 35:47.536
from where you are.

35:47.580 --> 35:49.973
Even I forgot just how hopeless
this time felt.

35:50.017 --> 35:53.673
It will be a long road.

35:53.716 --> 35:56.154
But just...

35:57.807 --> 35:59.592
...don't give up.

36:12.561 --> 36:15.085
All right, I am very grumpy!

36:15.129 --> 36:16.652
Just absolutely irate.

36:16.696 --> 36:18.306
And I need to be left alone.

36:18.350 --> 36:19.786
FEMALE:
Yes, sir.

36:27.837 --> 36:30.231
That was faster than
your spore breach excuse.

36:30.275 --> 36:31.537
Yeah, I was, uh,

36:31.580 --> 36:34.061
a tad more surly
pre-tardigrade DNA.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.325
[console beeping]

36:37.369 --> 36:38.848
What's wrong?

36:38.892 --> 36:41.242
No, it's just
the, uh, the inertial dampeners.

36:41.286 --> 36:44.332
These 23rd century systems
are muddying up in my head

36:44.376 --> 36:45.681
with the 32nd century systems

36:45.725 --> 36:47.379
-we have now.
-Yeah?

36:47.422 --> 36:49.816
Well, un-muddy them.
We're not exactly made of time.

36:49.859 --> 36:53.689
Okay, I need you to press pause
on the "gruff candor" routine.

36:53.733 --> 36:57.215
You have no idea
how much pressure I'm under.

36:57.258 --> 36:58.868
I thought that was your thing.

36:58.912 --> 37:01.219
Brilliant scientist
that everything's hanging on.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.916
Yeah, well, things change.

37:02.959 --> 37:04.439
And not every problem

37:04.483 --> 37:06.093
is something you can
figure out on your own.

37:06.136 --> 37:08.226
You try being the one
to keep this ship together

37:08.269 --> 37:11.098
so we don't die
and-and erase everything

37:11.141 --> 37:12.360
we've ever done from history.

37:12.404 --> 37:15.972
And even if we make it back,

37:16.016 --> 37:18.758
this Progenitor technology
we're after-- it's...

37:18.801 --> 37:21.282
it's different.
It's...

37:21.326 --> 37:25.025
it's bigger than anything
I have taken on before.

37:28.768 --> 37:31.336
You're not in any of it alone.

37:33.425 --> 37:36.776
What can I do to help,
right now?

37:38.952 --> 37:42.434
Well, I-I do need to finish
calibrating the dampeners,

37:42.477 --> 37:44.305
which is gonna take
a little time, so...

37:44.349 --> 37:47.134
if you could transfer control
of the plasma-coolant systems

37:47.177 --> 37:49.005
-to that console?
-Got it.

37:54.968 --> 37:57.275
Hey. Paul.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.930
Let's show 'em how
a couple of old dogs

38:00.974 --> 38:02.671
still know the best tricks.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.544
[chuckles softly]

38:16.424 --> 38:18.383
Lieutenant Owosekun,
run a multiphasic

38:18.426 --> 38:21.299
-scan of the system's...
-Michael, what are you
doing here?

38:24.302 --> 38:27.609
Specialist Burnham. You're not
authorized to be on the bridge.

38:27.653 --> 38:29.350
And why are you out of uniform?

38:29.394 --> 38:30.917
And what did you do
to your hair?

38:31.961 --> 38:34.616
-Love it.
-BURNHAM: This is gonna be hard
to understand at first,

38:34.660 --> 38:37.619
and hard to accept,
but I am from the future.

38:38.881 --> 38:41.101
-Security.
-No, w-wait, please.

38:41.144 --> 38:42.798
Listen, it's not a...
it's not a trick.

38:45.410 --> 38:48.500
In our future, Discovery
is on a very important mission

38:48.543 --> 38:50.589
to find an immense power,
and we've been stalled

38:50.632 --> 38:53.853
by a temporal weapon.
No need for that, Owo. I took

38:53.896 --> 38:55.942
a right cross from you in the
training room a few months back.

38:55.985 --> 38:58.205
-I don't need that
experience that again.
-AIRIAM: Computer,

38:58.248 --> 39:00.294
scan the ship for
Michael Burnham's life signs.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.949
COMPUTER:
There are two identical sets

39:02.992 --> 39:04.733
of Michael Burnham
life signs aboard.

39:04.777 --> 39:06.474
One is presently unconscious.

39:06.518 --> 39:09.085
It's fine. It's fine.
She's fine.

39:09.129 --> 39:10.391
I nerve pinched her.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.611
I just...
I need you to listen to me.

39:18.573 --> 39:20.575
There's a window on Deck Six
that you sit at

39:20.619 --> 39:22.403
when you're having a bad day.

39:22.447 --> 39:24.405
It's usually quieter
than the observation room.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.364
You joined Starfleet because
you weren't able to

39:26.407 --> 39:27.930
save your friend
when you were 15.

39:27.974 --> 39:29.932
And you love comms because

39:29.976 --> 39:31.673
you used to listen
to old radio emissions

39:31.717 --> 39:33.632
in space with your grandmother.

39:33.675 --> 39:36.025
And you're a cadet
who's frightened

39:36.069 --> 39:37.636
of rooming with a mutineer.

39:37.679 --> 39:39.072
You think I'm gonna
knife you in your sleep

39:39.115 --> 39:40.508
because of your snoring.

39:40.552 --> 39:42.249
I won't, by the way.

39:42.292 --> 39:43.903
Thank you.

39:46.471 --> 39:47.907
You say you're from the future.

39:47.950 --> 39:50.300
-I am.
-And you're a Starfleet captain?

39:51.345 --> 39:53.347
I'm Discovery'scaptain.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.523
[scoffs] Okay.

39:55.567 --> 39:58.308
BURNHAM:
Listen to me. I have seen
the Federation collapse.

39:58.352 --> 40:01.355
We all die because
I don't complete this mission.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.096
And I am running out of time.

40:03.139 --> 40:04.706
And, what, you just expect us
to believe all of this?

40:04.750 --> 40:07.796
No.
But Airiam will believe me.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.190
And I know you all trust her.

40:10.233 --> 40:11.757
Why?

40:13.889 --> 40:17.632
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to have to do this.

40:21.984 --> 40:24.160
Speak, Michael.

40:24.204 --> 40:26.162
I've seen how you die.

40:26.206 --> 40:27.729
Oh, no, no, no,
don't do that. No.

40:27.773 --> 40:29.078
If you won't get her
off the bridge, I will.

40:29.122 --> 40:30.645
396 days from now...

40:30.689 --> 40:32.386
Oh, Airiam,
we miss you every day.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.127
-Stop. Michael, st... Don't...
-Listen, I was there.

40:34.170 --> 40:36.564
An AI program
infects your augmentation.

40:36.608 --> 40:37.609
Enough.

40:37.652 --> 40:39.567
You sacrifice everything for us.

40:39.611 --> 40:42.309
That's a lie. Because we
would never let her do that.

40:42.352 --> 40:43.919
There was no other way.

40:43.963 --> 40:45.225
She'd fight it off.

40:45.268 --> 40:46.531
Some fights can't be won.

40:46.574 --> 40:49.011
She would never
give up like that.

40:49.055 --> 40:50.796
I would.

40:52.754 --> 40:57.411
If it came to that, I would.

41:06.246 --> 41:09.292
Phaser down, Bryce.

41:11.338 --> 41:13.427
What do you need from us?

41:15.081 --> 41:16.604
COMPUTER:
Everyone to their stations.

41:16.648 --> 41:18.127
We are going to maximum warp.

41:18.171 --> 41:20.086
She did it.
She damn well did it.

41:20.129 --> 41:21.522
She always does.

41:21.566 --> 41:24.003
All right, um, I'm almost done.

41:24.046 --> 41:25.526
Uh, be ready with
the chroniton stabilizer.

41:25.570 --> 41:27.659
Attach it to the bug on my mark.

41:27.702 --> 41:29.225
Yep, all good.

41:29.269 --> 41:32.446
Yeah, okay, uh,
we have three minutes left.

41:32.490 --> 41:34.361
It'll be close,
but I think we can make it.

41:34.404 --> 41:35.797
PAST BURNHAM:
Step away from the console.

41:37.059 --> 41:38.583
Both of you.

41:56.470 --> 41:58.733
We've reached maximum speed,
Commander.

41:58.777 --> 42:00.387
Ready to break the warp bubble
on your mark.

42:00.430 --> 42:01.475
Thank you, Lieutenant.

42:05.740 --> 42:08.047
Fascinating technology.

42:08.090 --> 42:10.963
I wish I were going to be around
to learn more about it.

42:12.878 --> 42:14.662
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

42:14.706 --> 42:15.968
If things go the way you expect,

42:16.011 --> 42:17.535
I won't remember anyway.

42:17.578 --> 42:20.276
-Are they ready to go?
-They should be.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.365
Rayner. Are we all set?

42:22.409 --> 42:24.890
RAYNER:
Actually, we have a problem.

42:26.326 --> 42:28.458
Your past self doesn't
want to screw up again.

42:28.502 --> 42:30.112
PAST BURNHAM:
Lieutenant Stamets,

42:30.156 --> 42:31.636
I don't know what that
shapeshifter and her friend

42:31.679 --> 42:33.115
have said to fool you,

42:33.159 --> 42:35.814
but you are going
to shut down the warp core

42:35.857 --> 42:38.294
and stop the ship. Now.

42:38.338 --> 42:40.601
Um, so,

42:40.645 --> 42:42.385
-like I said, it's because of...
-Uh, I think you need

42:42.429 --> 42:44.344
to come down here and have
a little talk with yourself.

42:44.387 --> 42:45.737
CURRENT BURNHAM:
I would never make it in time.

42:45.780 --> 42:47.042
We have less than three minute.

42:47.086 --> 42:49.088
Rayner, you have to handle this.

42:49.131 --> 42:50.829
What-what I really need
is for you

42:50.872 --> 42:52.700
to let me go back
to the console.

42:52.744 --> 42:54.223
We're about to break
the warp bubble.

42:54.267 --> 42:55.660
Shut it down.

42:55.703 --> 42:57.096
We won't ask again.

42:57.139 --> 42:58.097
Last warning.

42:58.140 --> 43:00.360
RAYNER:
Gen.

43:00.403 --> 43:02.362
We know each other.

43:02.405 --> 43:04.190
Anyone could look up
my first name.

43:04.233 --> 43:06.975
Yeah, that's right.
But I do know you.

43:07.019 --> 43:08.716
Not now. In the future.

43:08.760 --> 43:10.283
Now, you're Lieutenant Rhys.

43:10.326 --> 43:13.721
In my time, you're
Lieutenant Commander Rhys.

43:13.765 --> 43:15.897
You're my tactical officer.

43:15.941 --> 43:17.812
I'm tactical now,
it's not a stretch.

43:17.856 --> 43:20.946
Fair point.
Okay, something personal.

43:20.989 --> 43:23.035
You love ships.
You love the Crossfield.

43:23.078 --> 43:24.340
Who doesn't?

43:24.384 --> 43:25.646
23rd century Constitution class.

43:25.690 --> 43:27.430
That's your favorite.
You told me.

43:27.474 --> 43:28.736
You love the curves.

43:28.780 --> 43:30.477
And, Lieutenant,
I have to agree.

43:30.520 --> 43:33.611
That is one damn fine vessel.

43:39.312 --> 43:41.140
It's true.

43:41.183 --> 43:44.622
You know, even if he is from
the future, it's too dangerous.

43:48.669 --> 43:51.150
Don't make me shoot you,
Lieutenant.

43:51.193 --> 43:52.717
Michael?

43:52.760 --> 43:54.240
-They're working on it.
-STAMETS: We have

43:54.283 --> 43:56.503
-90 seconds left.
-PAST BURNHAM: If I let you

43:56.546 --> 43:58.070
do this, Discovery
would be destroyed.

43:58.113 --> 44:00.333
And if you don't,
the Burn won't end

44:00.376 --> 44:01.726
or maybe the Federation will.

44:03.205 --> 44:04.554
You don't trust us.
I get that.

44:04.598 --> 44:06.339
And from what I know about you,

44:06.382 --> 44:08.384
I wouldn't expect you to.

44:08.428 --> 44:10.604
-You don't know
anything about me.
-I know that the first day

44:10.648 --> 44:11.953
that you stood
on the bridge of this ship,

44:11.997 --> 44:13.694
you wanted to run.

44:13.738 --> 44:15.478
-Not another step.
-'Cause you felt

44:15.522 --> 44:17.089
you didn't deserve to be here.

44:21.615 --> 44:23.138
You told me that.

44:25.010 --> 44:26.446
Future you.

44:26.489 --> 44:29.144
And seeing that
was only a few weeks ago,

44:29.188 --> 44:31.016
I'm guessing you still do.

44:31.059 --> 44:34.106
But let me tell you something.

44:34.149 --> 44:36.369
You do deserve to be here.

44:36.412 --> 44:37.979
Doing a damn good job,

44:38.023 --> 44:40.155
and all this shit
you're going through

44:40.199 --> 44:42.592
is gonna make you into
one hell of a captain.

44:42.636 --> 44:44.203
30 seconds, Rayner.

44:44.246 --> 44:46.553
For what it's worth,
I lost my family young, too.

44:46.596 --> 44:47.728
And when that happens,
there's only

44:47.772 --> 44:49.425
one thing left you can trust.

44:49.469 --> 44:51.297
And that's the voice
in your head.

44:51.340 --> 44:53.255
Yours is gonna take you
to some great places.

44:53.299 --> 44:55.780
Keep trusting it.
Especially now,

44:55.823 --> 44:58.173
'cause I know
what it's telling you.

44:58.217 --> 45:01.568
Crazy as it seems,
do the right thing...

45:03.222 --> 45:05.093
...and stand down.

45:05.137 --> 45:07.008
Let us complete our mission.

45:18.977 --> 45:20.195
Captain, go!

45:20.239 --> 45:21.762
Do it now!

45:21.806 --> 45:24.069
-Lieutenant.
-Aye, Commander.
Initiating break.

45:24.112 --> 45:25.113
Exiting warp bubble

45:25.157 --> 45:28.334
in five, four,

45:28.377 --> 45:30.597
three, two,

45:30.640 --> 45:32.730
one.

45:36.429 --> 45:38.039
AIRIAM:
Status report.

45:38.083 --> 45:40.041
OWOSEKUN:
Inertial dampers
are holding, Commander.

45:41.782 --> 45:43.044
BURNHAM:
Do it now, Rayner!

45:49.572 --> 45:52.532
STAMETS:
Hang in there.
Just a few more seconds.

45:52.575 --> 45:54.186
[groaning]

46:03.412 --> 46:04.718
Ah.

46:04.762 --> 46:06.676
Oh, we are back to the present.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.896
We've only lost six hours.

46:08.940 --> 46:11.029
Felt like six years.

46:11.072 --> 46:13.205
The past hasn't been altered.

46:13.248 --> 46:15.294
Nothing's changed.

46:15.337 --> 46:17.818
We did it.

46:17.862 --> 46:20.081
[exhales]

46:21.909 --> 46:25.304
You okay?
Looks really painful.

46:25.347 --> 46:27.785
I'm good. I'm good.

46:27.828 --> 46:29.699
You should go see Dr. Culber,
he can fix it.

46:32.224 --> 46:33.616
[grunts softly]

46:40.623 --> 46:43.322
It's not lost on me
how you pulled this off.

46:44.671 --> 46:46.194
How we did.

46:47.152 --> 46:49.110
You with the crew, me with Rhys.

46:49.154 --> 46:51.199
And you knowing them...

46:52.984 --> 46:55.203
That's what convinced them.

46:55.247 --> 46:57.510
Familiarity can lead
to complacency as well.

46:57.553 --> 46:59.164
You're right about that.

47:00.208 --> 47:03.429
But we've somehow found
a way to use our connection

47:03.472 --> 47:06.824
to keep us honest,
make us better.

47:08.651 --> 47:10.740
-I should have
explained that to you.
-Eh.

47:10.784 --> 47:12.873
You show me more patience
than I deserve.

47:14.919 --> 47:16.964
Truth be told, I can be...

47:18.357 --> 47:19.880
...stubborn.

47:21.664 --> 47:23.101
Like you used to be.

47:25.407 --> 47:26.931
You know, I still am.

47:28.454 --> 47:30.021
Just in a different way.

47:30.064 --> 47:32.850
Seeing her
was a really good reminder.

47:32.893 --> 47:34.764
You know?

47:34.808 --> 47:37.463
We are always changing.

47:37.506 --> 47:39.291
With everything
that happens to us,

47:39.334 --> 47:41.554
with the choices we make,

47:41.597 --> 47:43.948
what's meaningful to us.

47:43.991 --> 47:45.688
I get that being here

47:45.732 --> 47:48.430
and the way you came here

47:48.474 --> 47:50.389
is a big adjustment.

47:51.912 --> 47:54.523
But I think we made
a pretty good team today.

47:55.481 --> 47:56.917
Yeah.

47:58.527 --> 48:00.834
We got the job done.

48:03.184 --> 48:06.361
Now, how do you want
to go about explaining all this?

48:06.405 --> 48:07.797
I think, with this crew,
they'll get it

48:07.841 --> 48:10.626
as soon as we say "time bug."

48:11.932 --> 48:12.977
[chuckling]

48:15.283 --> 48:17.329
[indistinct conversations]

48:24.031 --> 48:25.293
Would have been more satisfying

48:25.337 --> 48:28.340
if I'd been able to squish you.

48:28.383 --> 48:29.907
What is that thing?

48:31.647 --> 48:33.040
-Long story.
-Uh,

48:33.084 --> 48:34.868
would it have
anything to do with

48:34.912 --> 48:36.870
why I just blinked and six hours

48:36.914 --> 48:39.264
have somehow gone by?

48:40.569 --> 48:42.136
OWOSEKUN:
I'm honestly a little shocked

48:42.180 --> 48:43.659
my past self
believed you, Captain.

48:43.703 --> 48:44.965
DETMER:
Me too.

48:45.009 --> 48:46.488
I can't believe
I'd ever consider

48:46.532 --> 48:47.837
breaking the warp bubble.

48:48.926 --> 48:50.144
I'm just glad
we didn't shoot you.

48:50.188 --> 48:53.321
[laughs]

48:53.365 --> 48:56.063
There was a time I would have
thought I deserved it.

49:02.287 --> 49:04.898
Really glad
we all came together.

49:04.942 --> 49:08.597
Now, let's figure out what's
changed in the last six hours.

49:08.641 --> 49:10.034
Can the DOTs tell us anything?

49:10.077 --> 49:11.513
They did find something,
Captain:

49:11.557 --> 49:13.037
a warp signature.

49:13.080 --> 49:15.387
It matches with
L'ak and Moll's ship.

49:15.430 --> 49:19.086
Seems like your theory
was a good one, Commander Rhys.

49:19.130 --> 49:20.914
Good work.

49:25.223 --> 49:26.876
Where are Moll and L'ak now?

49:26.920 --> 49:28.791
That's the strange thing--
their trail disappears.

49:28.835 --> 49:31.925
Like they came here
and now they're just gone.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.014
Wherever they are,
that's where the next clue is.

49:34.058 --> 49:35.276
And these are the right
coordinates,

49:35.320 --> 49:36.799
so it's a mystery indeed.

49:36.843 --> 49:38.845
Are we ready?

49:38.888 --> 49:39.933
CREW:
Aye, Captain.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.500
Then let's get to solving it.
