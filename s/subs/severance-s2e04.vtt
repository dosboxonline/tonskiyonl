00:35.077 --> 00:36.203
Hello!

00:41.291 --> 00:42.751
Hello!

00:49.591 --> 00:50.592
Irving!

00:52.719 --> 00:55.305
- It's me. I'm up here!
- Mark!

00:55.889 --> 00:57.139
Yeah!

00:57.140 --> 00:58.225
Hey!

01:01.311 --> 01:02.770
What's happening?

01:02.771 --> 01:04.104
Where are we?

01:04.105 --> 01:06.400
I have no fucking idea,

01:07.317 --> 01:10.904
but there's a path up the cliff
right down there!

01:12.573 --> 01:14.199
Do you want me to come up?

01:15.534 --> 01:16.869
Well, yeah!

01:19.830 --> 01:23.792
I'm on the ice. I'm on the fucking ice!

01:24.418 --> 01:26.795
Maybe get off of it. Come on!

01:33.594 --> 01:34.595
I'm coming!

01:42.019 --> 01:43.020
I'm--

01:44.438 --> 01:45.479
I'm coming!

01:45.480 --> 01:46.773
Be careful!

02:01.079 --> 02:02.706
It's very steep!

02:25.646 --> 02:26.647
Irving.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.524
Helly!

02:30.526 --> 02:31.860
Where did you come from?

02:32.402 --> 02:33.694
I don't know.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.113
What are we doing out here?

02:35.864 --> 02:37.324
Up here!

02:38.033 --> 02:40.744
Follow my voice!

02:43.247 --> 02:44.248
Mark!

02:48.961 --> 02:49.962
Mark!

02:50.629 --> 02:52.130
Up here!

02:55.592 --> 02:56.843
Mark.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.261
Hey!

02:58.262 --> 02:59.346
Are you okay?

03:00.222 --> 03:01.889
- Did you wake up on the ice too?
- Yeah.

03:01.890 --> 03:03.976
- What about you?
- On the cliff.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.687
Oh, my God.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.357
- Is it you?
- Of course it's us.

03:11.358 --> 03:12.860
Holy shit!

03:13.527 --> 03:15.612
Out-fucking-side.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.574
Oh, my God. I mean,
I knew there was no actual ceiling,

03:19.575 --> 03:21.243
but this is fucking insane.

03:22.661 --> 03:23.662
Hello?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.832
Hello?

03:35.757 --> 03:36.800
What is that?

04:30.604 --> 04:32.231
<i>Good morning, Refiners.</i>

04:33.232 --> 04:36.359
<i>This is Mr. Milchick from work,
and I'm thrilled to welcome you</i>

04:36.360 --> 04:38.528
<i>to your first ever</i>

04:38.529 --> 04:42.991
<i>outdoor retreat
and team-building occurrence.</i>

04:44.243 --> 04:49.831
<i>This ORTBO is in response
to your desire to see the outside world.</i>

04:50.374 --> 04:51.958
<i>With your outies' blessings,</i>

04:51.959 --> 04:56.087
<i>you will spend the next two calendar days
walking the meadows,</i>

04:56.088 --> 05:01.593
<i>thickets, brambles and brooks that
make up the Dieter Eagan National Forest.</i>

05:03.303 --> 05:05.222
Who the fuck is Dieter Eagan?

05:07.933 --> 05:09.226
<i>Dieter Eagan?</i>

05:10.102 --> 05:12.896
<i>Some of you may be
quietly yearning to learn more.</i>

05:13.772 --> 05:17.860
<i>The truth you seek lies
within the fourth appendix.</i>

05:19.111 --> 05:23.364
<i>Kier dictated a fourth
appendix in his final hours of life,</i>

05:23.365 --> 05:28.287
<i>a text of such sanctity that it
is forbidden upon the severed floor.</i>

05:29.621 --> 05:32.416
<i>It's waiting for you in Scissor Cave,</i>

05:33.625 --> 05:34.750
<i>the very same grotto</i>

05:34.751 --> 05:38.839
<i>where Kier Eagan tamed the four
tempers for the very first time.</i>

05:39.965 --> 05:41.175
<i>And do remember,</i>

05:42.050 --> 05:47.681
<i>"Stray not from Kier's path,
lest you roil nature's wrath."</i>

05:50.225 --> 05:52.060
<i>There will be help along the way.</i>

05:54.855 --> 05:56.481
<i>Happy fortunes, MDR.</i>

06:04.990 --> 06:06.325
Scissor Cave.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.462
What the fuck is that?

06:28.847 --> 06:30.974
He looks like Mark.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.073
Milchick said there'd
be help along the way.

06:46.865 --> 06:50.076
I wouldn't trust a word out of that
mountebank's mouth.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.537
Not even televisually.

07:05.634 --> 07:08.512
Not like we have a lot of
other options right now, Irv.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.298
Wait.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.301
"Chapter one.

10:36.678 --> 10:38.514
I was not born into this world alone.

10:39.765 --> 10:42.518
The lodgings of my mother's
womb I shared with another,

10:43.143 --> 10:45.062
a twin brother who was called Dieter."

10:47.314 --> 10:48.732
Kier had a twin?

10:50.651 --> 10:52.486
That's what those things are.

10:53.237 --> 10:54.279
Yeah.

10:55.572 --> 10:59.952
"In infancy, he was my bosom friend.
But as we blossomed into boyhood,

11:00.744 --> 11:03.705
he beseeched me to take to
the wood with him to live as paupers.

11:05.249 --> 11:08.168
My love for my twin
unbalancing my judgment,

11:08.836 --> 11:12.172
I acceded, and we ventured
into the wood towards"...

11:14.466 --> 11:15.968
"Woe's Hollow."

11:23.183 --> 11:28.647
So,
we're to walk in the brothers' footsteps.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.780
"He always crept like this at this hour.

11:37.823 --> 11:41.242
- Once concealed by flora, my brother"...
- <i>...flora, my brother</i>

11:41.243 --> 11:43.661
<i>unfastened himself.</i>

11:43.662 --> 11:50.752
<i>The din of his fervor fell strangely
into concert with the music of the wood.</i>

11:51.461 --> 11:54.338
<i>His every thrust found rhythm</i>

11:54.339 --> 11:57.258
- <i>with the trill of the crickets...</i>
- ..."trill of the crickets"...

11:57.259 --> 11:59.928
- <i>...and the moaning of the wind...</i>
- ..."and the moaning of the wind"...

12:00.470 --> 12:04.015
- <i>...and the snowfall's yearly thaw.</i>
- ..."and the snowfall's yearly thaw."

12:04.016 --> 12:06.726
<i>Dieter became, on that night</i>

12:06.727 --> 12:09.312
- <i>an instrument of nature...</i>
- ..."an instrument of nature"...

12:09.313 --> 12:12.982
- <i>...and nature played Dieter...</i>
- "and nature played Dieter with elegance.

12:12.983 --> 12:16.319
I had no choice but to listen

12:16.320 --> 12:20.449
as he spilt his lineage upon the soil."

12:43.222 --> 12:44.556
Now there's a me one.

13:28.767 --> 13:29.810
You okay?

13:31.103 --> 13:32.104
Yeah.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.065
I just wish I knew where we were going.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.424
Fuck.

14:24.406 --> 14:27.284
What were you and Helly
talking about back there?

14:37.044 --> 14:38.045
When?

14:39.713 --> 14:41.673
I don't trust her.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.969
I think she might be lying
about what her outie saw.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.804
Why would you think that?

14:48.514 --> 14:49.932
Night gardeners.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.644
It's clear you do not have
an objective perspective

14:54.645 --> 14:56.020
due to your feelings for her.

14:56.021 --> 14:59.191
My feelings for her have
nothing to do with anything, okay--

15:20.754 --> 15:22.130
What the fuck?

15:25.008 --> 15:26.301
What is it?

15:27.219 --> 15:28.220
I don't know.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.015
Looks like a seal.

15:37.062 --> 15:38.856
Why does it look so messed up?

15:40.774 --> 15:43.443
I don't know.
Maybe this is what dead things look like.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.281
We should eat it.

15:48.282 --> 15:49.282
Pardon me?

15:49.283 --> 15:51.618
We don't know if there's
food waiting at the hollow.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.954
We don't even know where we are.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.915
They can't let anything happen to us.

15:57.499 --> 15:58.457
It's an ORTBO.

15:58.458 --> 16:01.878
Outdoor retreat team-building occurrence.
Right, Mark?

16:01.879 --> 16:03.630
We don't know what this is.

16:04.590 --> 16:07.593
- We don't know anything!
- Irving, calm down.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.138
We all know you had a bad experience
the last time you were outside--

16:12.139 --> 16:14.599
Who said I had a bad experience?

16:14.600 --> 16:15.809
Oh, my God.

16:17.895 --> 16:19.645
What did you tell him, dumbass?

16:19.646 --> 16:22.482
Nothing! What the fuck?

16:23.775 --> 16:25.611
Let's just get to the hollow.

17:19.957 --> 17:22.041
Kier's twin was always with him.

17:24.419 --> 17:27.047
That's why we provided
the very same for each of you.

17:28.131 --> 17:30.091
Fuck you all. I was right.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.426
Mr. Milchick.

17:32.594 --> 17:35.138
This is the tallest waterfall
on the planet.

17:37.140 --> 17:42.437
You have followed the path of Kier
and Dieter, and reached Woe's Hollow.

17:43.772 --> 17:45.482
You stand upon sacred earth.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.069
We're starving, Mr. Milchick.

17:50.362 --> 17:51.363
Are you?

17:52.948 --> 17:55.492
I thought the waterfall's
grandeur would satiate you.

17:59.413 --> 18:01.123
I'm teasing, of course.

18:02.416 --> 18:04.751
Lumon will always protect and provide.

18:05.878 --> 18:06.879
Right this way.

19:06.480 --> 19:12.110
Miss Huang has been readying the grill for
which we brought in copious luxury meats.

19:14.112 --> 19:17.199
The fire will be used for
marshmallows and a recital later.

19:18.200 --> 19:20.994
The tents, as you can see, are MDR blue

19:21.912 --> 19:26.458
and the outhouse is stocked
with four-ply washroom tissue.

19:28.627 --> 19:29.628
Wow.

19:30.671 --> 19:32.089
Wow, indeed, Helly R.

19:33.674 --> 19:38.428
Also, for your
comfort and safety, torches,

19:39.054 --> 19:41.765
which can provide both
a heat and a light source.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.268
Double duty.

19:46.061 --> 19:47.563
It's beautiful.

19:49.857 --> 19:51.233
Pretty cool, right?

19:54.111 --> 19:56.154
Yes, lovely.

20:02.411 --> 20:03.412
Irving?

20:03.912 --> 20:04.913
Enter.

20:18.594 --> 20:20.053
Made you a snow seal.

20:27.561 --> 20:28.979
In case you were hungry.

20:31.607 --> 20:32.608
Yeah.

20:33.525 --> 20:38.613
I feel silly for suggesting
we eat that animal.

20:38.614 --> 20:43.659
I suppose
it sounded alarmist and paranoid.

20:43.660 --> 20:44.702
Irrational.

20:44.703 --> 20:47.831
No. It was fine. We were all a little...

20:54.755 --> 20:55.756
Yeah.

21:03.305 --> 21:06.683
What did you really see
during the overtime contingency?

21:14.191 --> 21:15.192
I told you.

21:17.611 --> 21:18.612
It's okay.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.573
It won't change anything.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.292
Irving.

21:43.929 --> 21:45.222
Okay.

22:06.618 --> 22:09.037
"Dieter lay unwashed in his bedroll,

22:09.746 --> 22:12.332
though the hollow's pool
was primed for bathing.

22:13.417 --> 22:15.334
We ate of the hare we'd caught

22:15.335 --> 22:19.381
and told each other rhyming jokes
till our gullets ached.

22:20.632 --> 22:25.345
But at last,
the thought tickling my mouth emerged.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.224
'We must return to Father,' I said.

22:30.225 --> 22:32.936
'But I promise to look
after you in the ether mill.'

22:34.479 --> 22:39.276
When at last a sound came from him,
it was a bewailing whimper.

22:39.985 --> 22:44.990
He believed, I suppose,
that we'd be woodland paupers forever.

22:48.911 --> 22:51.330
I was looking at him
when his eye came out.

22:52.122 --> 22:53.749
It popped from the socket,

22:54.625 --> 22:59.213
driven by a sudden torrent of pus
from his skull.

23:01.715 --> 23:04.800
And he reached up to grasp at his hair,

23:04.801 --> 23:09.389
which was suddenly moss that tore
easily from his bleeding scalp."

23:10.349 --> 23:11.599
Good heavens.

23:11.600 --> 23:15.853
"And as the pus
from his eye thickened into sap,

23:15.854 --> 23:20.859
I turned from my gargling brother
and walked to the pool of the hollow,

23:21.360 --> 23:26.532
where I knew the waterfall
would drown out my brother's cries."

23:28.116 --> 23:29.409
That's actually really smart.

23:30.118 --> 23:35.082
"And it was here that I
first encountered the temper Woe,

23:36.291 --> 23:41.713
a gaunt bride,
half the height of a natural woman.

24:00.649 --> 24:04.111
She spoke to me
directly from her eyes and said,

24:05.445 --> 24:06.738
'This is your doing.

24:08.115 --> 24:10.742
You suffered his wantonness.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.162
Now he's no one's brother.

24:15.247 --> 24:17.499
Only chaos's whore.'"

24:27.759 --> 24:28.760
The end.

24:35.392 --> 24:38.645
Perhaps in the morning,
we'll have time for the next chapter...

24:39.855 --> 24:42.524
"Kier and the Thieving Nanny."

24:44.735 --> 24:45.569
Creepy.

24:47.738 --> 24:51.283
Did his brother really die that way,
Mr. Milchick?

24:54.745 --> 24:58.457
The handbook enriches our work
with tales of the founder's life.

25:00.334 --> 25:01.710
Every word is truth.

25:06.381 --> 25:09.175
I'm sorry. Sorry.

25:09.176 --> 25:10.260
Helly.

25:12.596 --> 25:13.430
What?

25:17.976 --> 25:20.646
- Helly R.?
- You guys...

25:21.146 --> 25:22.439
He melted, right?

25:23.315 --> 25:25.817
He turned into the forest
because he masturbated.

25:28.278 --> 25:31.365
I mean, seriously, that's actually
the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

25:33.867 --> 25:36.745
Right? He jerked off
in front of his brother...

25:37.913 --> 25:40.415
and he got punished for it.

25:41.416 --> 25:43.042
Wha... You can't say that.

25:43.043 --> 25:45.921
- He just said it.
- Wha... He did.

25:47.798 --> 25:49.424
I... It's...

25:51.593 --> 25:54.555
You know, we often laugh
at what we don't understand.

25:59.518 --> 26:02.729
The team I thought I knew
would have processed more thoughtfully.

26:06.316 --> 26:07.317
Miss Huang.

26:11.405 --> 26:12.823
The marshmallows, please.

26:22.374 --> 26:24.001
Throw them in the fire.

26:25.210 --> 26:27.838
Mr. Milchick, come on.

26:28.505 --> 26:30.632
Now, Miss Huang.

26:35.345 --> 26:37.347
- Oh, my...
- Why?

26:38.640 --> 26:41.602
Marshmallows are for team players, Dylan.

26:42.561 --> 26:44.354
They don't just hand them out.

26:50.235 --> 26:51.236
What?

26:54.281 --> 26:55.282
Good night.

27:04.666 --> 27:05.751
Wow.

27:06.543 --> 27:08.295
Oh, my God.

27:09.087 --> 27:11.340
Hey, what do you think
his dick turned into?

27:19.681 --> 27:20.933
It isn't funny.

27:22.226 --> 27:23.851
I don't know. It's pretty funny.

27:23.852 --> 27:26.062
- Well, it's not.
- Okay.

27:26.063 --> 27:28.941
And stop making goo-goo eyes at her.

27:31.568 --> 27:34.403
- I'm not.
- Stop.

27:34.404 --> 27:35.489
"Goo-goo eyes"?

27:38.492 --> 27:40.077
Just tell us, Helly.

27:41.703 --> 27:42.703
What?

27:42.704 --> 27:44.288
Come on. Tell us.

27:44.289 --> 27:45.874
Tell us what?

27:47.167 --> 27:48.544
Just tell us about him.

27:49.920 --> 27:50.921
Who?

27:54.007 --> 27:55.342
The night gardener.

27:58.053 --> 27:59.555
Irv, come on.

28:00.305 --> 28:01.723
Did he have a flashlight?

28:05.686 --> 28:06.769
What was he wearing?

28:06.770 --> 28:08.187
What is your deal right now, dude?

28:08.188 --> 28:10.357
What color was his shirt?

28:11.900 --> 28:13.193
Did he have on a vest?

28:14.695 --> 28:17.738
- A luminescent vest? Tell us...
- Okay.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.699
- ...exactly what he was wear--
- Irving. That's enough.

28:19.700 --> 28:21.659
- Enough?
- Yeah.

28:21.660 --> 28:24.496
Using your pupils to make love to her

28:25.205 --> 28:27.874
while your outie's wife
rots away somewhere.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.083
Hey, shut up.

28:29.084 --> 28:30.711
Yeah. Fuck you, Irv.

28:33.130 --> 28:35.424
So it's three against one now, huh?

28:40.095 --> 28:41.096
It's okay.

28:42.514 --> 28:45.851
We all know Irving's upset
because he can't ever see Burt again.

28:50.647 --> 28:52.065
And he's really lonely.

29:19.593 --> 29:21.052
Hey, Irv.

29:21.053 --> 29:22.346
Fuck you all.

30:08.684 --> 30:11.645
Probably a carrot.

30:14.064 --> 30:15.065
What?

30:19.987 --> 30:21.238
Dieter's penis.

30:27.119 --> 30:30.455
Yeah, or some other root vegetable.

30:46.930 --> 30:49.725
That was mean of me...

30:51.810 --> 30:53.270
to say that to Irving.

30:59.067 --> 31:03.572
I mean, he kind of deserved it.

31:10.621 --> 31:13.332
And I can make goo-goo eyes
at anyone I want.

31:22.049 --> 31:23.300
Are you okay?

31:29.139 --> 31:31.308
Sorry if I'm distracting you from...

31:34.186 --> 31:35.187
From what?

31:38.565 --> 31:42.194
From looking for your wife.

31:46.406 --> 31:47.991
Hey, it's okay.

31:48.951 --> 31:52.913
I know we'll find her,
and you've already helped so much.

32:00.045 --> 32:01.046
I have?

32:01.964 --> 32:02.965
Yeah.

32:08.303 --> 32:09.304
Okay.

33:56.620 --> 33:58.247
Mr. Milchick!

34:01.500 --> 34:03.126
Mr. Milchick!

34:04.878 --> 34:05.879
Miss Huang!

34:08.465 --> 34:10.132
Mr. Milchick!

34:17.099 --> 34:18.475
Miss Huang!

34:59.725 --> 35:01.518
Mr. Milchick!

36:23.392 --> 36:25.769
I didn't like who I was on the outside.

36:31.358 --> 36:32.734
I was ashamed.

36:43.662 --> 36:44.663
Who were you?

37:00.345 --> 37:02.598
I don't care who you are out there.

37:05.100 --> 37:07.060
I care who you are with me.

37:11.315 --> 37:12.316
That's all.

37:14.067 --> 37:15.235
Okay?

37:26.747 --> 37:27.748
Are you okay?

37:34.087 --> 37:35.088
What happened?

37:36.882 --> 37:38.050
Are you okay?

37:38.759 --> 37:39.760
Yeah.

37:43.722 --> 37:44.723
Okay.

41:32.201 --> 41:33.202
Helly?

41:35.454 --> 41:36.455
Helly?

41:38.832 --> 41:39.832
Hey, where's Helly?

41:39.833 --> 41:42.752
I don't know. Irv never came back
last night, and he's not in his tent.

41:42.753 --> 41:43.920
What?

41:43.921 --> 41:45.172
Mr. Milchick?

41:46.131 --> 41:47.131
Helly!

41:47.132 --> 41:48.425
Mr. Milchick!

41:50.344 --> 41:51.345
Mark.

41:52.679 --> 41:55.431
Mark. Dylan, what's happened?

41:55.432 --> 41:56.933
Helly and Irv are missing.

41:56.934 --> 41:58.227
What the fuck is going on?

42:31.218 --> 42:32.469
Hey, kid.

42:34.638 --> 42:35.639
Irving.

42:40.477 --> 42:43.897
What are you doing down here?

42:49.278 --> 42:50.988
What are you doing down here?

42:52.614 --> 42:54.157
I slept outside.

42:55.617 --> 42:57.411
I almost froze to death.

43:03.292 --> 43:05.085
What you said to me last night,

43:06.253 --> 43:07.588
it was cruel.

43:11.341 --> 43:13.010
Helly was never cruel.

43:16.555 --> 43:17.598
I'm right here.

43:24.479 --> 43:26.523
So if you're not her...

43:28.817 --> 43:30.194
then who are you?

43:32.905 --> 43:36.950
Who would have the power to send
their outie to the severed floor?

43:48.253 --> 43:49.254
I'm sorry.

43:51.089 --> 43:52.090
No! Irving!

43:53.300 --> 43:54.759
Mr. Milchick!

43:54.760 --> 43:57.054
- No. No!
- Come on.

43:58.388 --> 44:01.349
- Irving. Stop. Irving, no.
- Mr. Milchick!

44:01.350 --> 44:02.434
Please, stop.

44:03.435 --> 44:04.436
Help!

44:06.355 --> 44:08.023
- Mr. Milchick!
- No!

44:13.153 --> 44:14.154
Irving?

44:14.655 --> 44:16.573
Mr. Milchick!

44:17.574 --> 44:18.575
Irving!

44:20.202 --> 44:21.702
Mr. Milchick!

44:21.703 --> 44:23.872
- Come!
- Mark!

44:24.623 --> 44:25.874
Mr. Milchick!

44:28.001 --> 44:29.837
Mr. Milchick!

44:30.379 --> 44:32.088
- Mark!
- Helly!

44:32.089 --> 44:34.757
- Turn her back, Mr. Milchick!
- Help!

44:34.758 --> 44:35.842
What are you doing, man?

44:35.843 --> 44:39.012
- Turn her back!
- Irv, what the fuck?

44:39.596 --> 44:41.640
She's an outie!

44:42.140 --> 44:44.225
- Hey! Irving, stop it!
- Hey! Irv, cut it out!

44:44.226 --> 44:46.477
- Stop!
- She's been an outie the whole time,

44:46.478 --> 44:48.062
ever since she came back!

44:48.063 --> 44:51.774
- Irving, you stop now!
- Stop it!

44:51.775 --> 44:53.442
Irving, stop this!

44:53.443 --> 44:55.403
She's a fucking mole!

44:55.404 --> 44:56.904
What are you doing?

44:56.905 --> 44:59.032
- Irving!
- I'm gonna kill her, Mr. Milchick!

45:00.492 --> 45:02.411
Irving! Irving!

45:03.287 --> 45:06.123
Stop! Stop this!

45:07.082 --> 45:08.207
She's not Helly!

45:08.208 --> 45:09.710
She's an Eagan!

45:10.294 --> 45:13.963
Turn her back, Mr. Milchick!
Turn her back!

45:13.964 --> 45:16.090
Goddamn it, Seth, do it!

45:16.091 --> 45:19.344
Yes! Do it, Seth!

45:21.763 --> 45:23.182
Hey!

45:29.188 --> 45:32.232
It's Milchick.
Remove the Glasgow block now.

45:36.320 --> 45:37.196
Now!

45:48.957 --> 45:49.958
I'm sorry.

45:51.126 --> 45:53.378
I'm so sorry, Helly.

45:55.339 --> 45:56.757
What's happening?

46:01.637 --> 46:02.679
Helly!

46:10.938 --> 46:12.105
I'm sorry, Helly.

46:18.237 --> 46:21.156
Irving B., stand.

46:26.036 --> 46:29.540
You have threatened collegial murder
in the pond of Woe's Hollow.

46:30.040 --> 46:34.378
For this, there can be no penalty
but immediate and permanent dismissal.

46:35.420 --> 46:39.258
There shall be no formal valediction,
catered or otherwise.

46:40.384 --> 46:42.678
Your outie will be notified forthwith.

46:44.346 --> 46:48.140
Irv! I'm sorry!

46:48.141 --> 46:49.810
I should have listened!

46:51.436 --> 46:55.107
It's okay. It's all okay.

46:58.318 --> 47:01.488
Just remember, hang in there.

47:03.365 --> 47:05.825
Please refrain from any further speech,

47:05.826 --> 47:09.871
as you are no longer authorized
to consort with any severed employee,

47:09.872 --> 47:11.289
nor they with you.

47:11.290 --> 47:13.333
Leave him alone!

47:13.834 --> 47:15.919
Turn around!

47:23.218 --> 47:25.512
Leave him alone!

47:56.460 --> 47:58.295
Walk into the forest.

48:30.410 --> 48:32.328
Your workspace will be cleared

48:32.329 --> 48:35.957
and any personal items discarded.

48:35.958 --> 48:40.545
Your file, including any
and all professional interactions

48:40.546 --> 48:41.963
and personal relations,

48:41.964 --> 48:45.759
will be purged and destroyed.

48:46.760 --> 48:50.137
It will be as if you, Irving B.,

48:50.138 --> 48:52.515
never even existed

48:52.516 --> 48:56.770
nor drew a single breath upon this Earth.

49:02.985 --> 49:08.615
May Kier's mercy follow you
into the eternal dark.

49:13.829 --> 49:15.163
Now.
