WEBVTT

01:36.262 --> 01:38.848
All right, move out!

02:06.084 --> 02:07.544
Let's go! Move it out!

02:51.087 --> 02:54.090
He's dead! He's dead!
Leave him! Come on, let's go!

03:40.220 --> 03:42.429
<i>Dear Billy,
I'm so worried about you.</i>

03:42.430 --> 03:45.140
<i>I miss you so much.
Why haven't you written me back?</i>

03:45.141 --> 03:47.726
<i>I don't know
if this letter will get to you.</i>

03:47.727 --> 03:49.269
<i>Praying for your safe return.</i>

03:49.270 --> 03:51.939
<i>I miss you so much.
Why haven't you written me back?</i>

03:51.940 --> 03:55.567
<i>Dear William, come back soon.
Is everything okay?</i>

03:55.568 --> 03:58.028
<i>I've been overseas in this war
for over a year now.</i>

03:58.029 --> 03:59.613
<i>Dear Daddy, I miss you so much.</i>

03:59.614 --> 04:02.866
<i>My dearest Michael,
I am praying for your safe return.</i>

04:02.867 --> 04:05.661
<i>I think of you,
and that is every day.</i>

04:05.662 --> 04:07.329
<i>I miss you so very much.</i>

04:07.330 --> 04:11.041
- <i>Lately, it's been a long...</i>
- <i>Here we are a short distance...</i>

04:11.042 --> 04:13.627
<i>I've written two
or three times recently...</i>

04:13.628 --> 04:15.671
<i>Lately, it's been a long time...</i>

04:15.672 --> 04:19.801
<i>I'm so worried about you.
Why haven't you written to me?</i>

04:53.710 --> 04:56.461
Abram David, you must stop making
a spectacle of yourself

04:56.462 --> 04:58.005
by parading around with the likes--

04:58.006 --> 04:59.464
Mary Kathryn, don't you dare.

04:59.465 --> 05:01.341
It's not proper.
Quite frankly--

05:01.342 --> 05:03.051
Get out of her way.

05:03.052 --> 05:04.720
I will not.

05:04.721 --> 05:07.015
Okay. Well, fine.

05:07.932 --> 05:11.519
Lena, German U-boat, twelve o'clock low,
vector six niner, niner west.

05:18.067 --> 05:18.943
Go!

05:32.540 --> 05:33.583
Look out!

05:39.714 --> 05:43.675
Don't you worry, Miss Lena Derriecott,
nothing will harm you on my plane.

05:43.676 --> 05:45.927
Pull back on the stick!
German plane, three o'clock!

05:45.928 --> 05:47.013
Whoa!

06:02.278 --> 06:04.113
- Madam.
- Thank you.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.574
Abram David, you're gonna get me
in a world of trouble.

06:07.575 --> 06:10.118
- Oh, I'm sorry, but--
- I'm sure my mother is watching.

06:10.119 --> 06:12.079
Sorry, but we were on a combat mission.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.290
- We had to get away from the enemy.
- Mary Kathryn is no Hitler.

06:15.291 --> 06:16.917
Are you sure?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.335
That's not funny.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.629
You heard Edward R. Murrow
just like I did.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.256
He said Hitler is a monster.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.218
And that is exactly why
I'm going into the battle.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.471
Don't give me the long face.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.973
Just gonna miss you, that's all.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.935
- Can't believe you're going to the Army.
- Don't worry.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.145
You see how well I drive
this old Chevrolet?

06:37.146 --> 06:39.440
Getting my practice
for when I'm in the cockpit.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.650
Abram, this is serious.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.236
- I know you know that--
- Is this out of concern for my well-being?

06:44.237 --> 06:47.239
Or because we won't be able to make
Mary Kathryn and her friends

06:47.240 --> 06:49.534
turn green with envy every day?

06:54.705 --> 06:56.082
But, like, here's my thing...

06:58.584 --> 06:59.502
It's true.

07:00.002 --> 07:01.503
Come along now, Lena.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.588
Yes, ma'am.

07:04.006 --> 07:07.300
- Hi, Mrs. Derriecott. Have a great day.
- You do the same, Abram.

07:07.301 --> 07:11.264
Don't you worry, Miss Lena.
I will write you every chance I get.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.694
I see that boy done dropped you off again.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.071
You mighty close to him.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.073
Something you wanna tell us?

07:30.074 --> 07:33.452
- Auntie, we are just friends.
- That better be all it is.

07:33.453 --> 07:36.705
Oh, Emma, she's soon to be 18.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.457
Going off to the university.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.543
There'll be a lot more boys there.

07:41.043 --> 07:43.546
Don't rush into nothing
like your mama did.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.383
Go on and get washed up.
We need you to help us tonight.

07:48.384 --> 07:49.385
Yes, ma'am.

07:50.094 --> 07:50.927
Lena?

07:50.928 --> 07:52.804
- Mm.
- You got the best attitude.

07:52.805 --> 07:56.475
Your mama here wants me to make
all the kosher meals and serve 'em too.

07:56.476 --> 07:57.392
Oh.

07:57.393 --> 08:00.979
And you'll be happy to know
that Mr. David has hired me

08:00.980 --> 08:02.982
to cater your boyfriend's party.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.693
He's not my boyfriend.

08:06.694 --> 08:08.863
Then why is you smiling?

08:16.871 --> 08:19.873
I wish you wouldn't fill her head
with that talk.

08:19.874 --> 08:23.793
That boy is Jewish.
That can't bit-mo be, and you know it.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.630
Oh, Emma, she just having fun.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.466
Well, she need to have fun
with a Negro boy.

08:29.467 --> 08:32.845
And on top of that, you talking schooling.

08:33.596 --> 08:36.640
You know we ain't got the money
to send her to that school.

08:36.641 --> 08:40.645
Well, we gonna get all the money we need
to send that girl to the university.

08:41.729 --> 08:45.149
Well, I sure would like
to see you do it, Susie.

08:55.493 --> 08:58.996
Well, Rabbi Wise got an audience
with President Roosevelt.

08:59.497 --> 09:01.706
We must do something
to help with the rescue.

09:01.707 --> 09:04.043
Hitler has murdered two million Jews,

09:04.961 --> 09:08.631
and I'm told women and children
are in that number.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.799
So we can't just sit idly by.

09:10.800 --> 09:15.554
We're leaning on every official we can
to get a humanitarian effort underway.

09:15.555 --> 09:19.141
It's a horror
the imagination cannot grasp.

09:19.725 --> 09:23.980
There were concentration camps.
Now there are extermination camps.

09:24.814 --> 09:26.649
What a brave boy your Abram is.

09:28.776 --> 09:29.652
Excuse me.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.654
No, thank you, Lena.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.573
Indeed, he is.

09:34.073 --> 09:37.660
His desire was to be a Ritchie Boy,
but he's not fluent in German.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.463
Finally. The place where you belong.

10:06.188 --> 10:09.858
I can't stay long. This party is for you.
You should be in there.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.402
Some going-away party.

10:12.028 --> 10:14.739
All they're talking about
is how bad the war is.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.245
Well... it is.

10:22.246 --> 10:24.582
Right now,
I'd rather be out here with you.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.087
I'm gonna miss you, Lena.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.131
I'm gonna miss you too.

10:34.133 --> 10:34.967
But...

10:36.469 --> 10:38.471
But I better be going.

10:40.306 --> 10:43.225
If my mother knew I was here,
I'd be as good as dead.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.562
Well, at least you won't kill
Mary Kathryn.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.691
She is a horrible person
for treating you that way

10:51.692 --> 10:53.360
because of the color of your skin.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.987
It's not the only reason.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.657
She likes you.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.661
She thinks we're courting,
even though we're not.

11:02.662 --> 11:03.579
We're just...

11:05.206 --> 11:06.082
friends.

11:09.418 --> 11:12.004
Well, you tell that story
enough to others.

11:13.714 --> 11:15.800
Maybe we started to believe it ourselves.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.305
Kiss me.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.393
I am not kissing you.
What are you saying--

11:26.394 --> 11:28.770
<i>♪ You made me love you ♪</i>

11:28.771 --> 11:31.439
<i>♪ I didn't wanna do it
I didn't wanna do it ♪</i>

11:31.440 --> 11:33.149
You have the worst voice.

11:33.150 --> 11:37.112
<i>♪ You made me want you
And all the time you knew it... ♪</i>

11:37.113 --> 11:38.029
Stop it.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.240
Stop it!

11:40.366 --> 11:41.283
Gosh.

11:41.784 --> 11:42.827
When you kiss me.

11:52.211 --> 11:53.379
Lena Derriecott,

11:55.047 --> 11:56.132
I'm in love with you.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.010
And I know you feel the same way.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.597
I'm gonna fight in this war, and...

12:07.685 --> 12:10.813
I want you to wear this ring as a promise
that you will wait for me to return

12:11.397 --> 12:15.025
so that we can start to acknowledge
what we have both denied for far too long.

12:16.152 --> 12:19.822
You know this is not right
in the eyes of many people.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.284
The only eyes that matter are ours.

12:27.913 --> 12:28.748
Lena.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.667
Ain't you supposed to be working?

12:32.209 --> 12:33.085
Yes, ma'am.

12:33.669 --> 12:34.545
The tray.

12:35.045 --> 12:36.088
Yes, ma'am.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.257
Yes, ma'am.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.887
Hi, Mrs. Derriecott.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.515
If you wanna court my daughter,

12:47.933 --> 12:50.727
you show up at my house
like a proper gentleman

12:50.728 --> 12:53.354
and ask me and her father.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.815
Do you understand me?

12:55.816 --> 12:56.734
Yes, ma'am.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.904
And when I return from the war,

13:01.197 --> 13:02.615
that'll be my first mission.

13:19.590 --> 13:22.051
- Anything from my boys?
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

13:48.786 --> 13:52.039
- Where you get that ring?
- Cracker Jack box.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.545
Little girl!

13:58.546 --> 13:59.505
Sorry, Mama.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.302
He ain't been gone
no more than a few months.

14:06.303 --> 14:10.224
Your husband been gone longer than that
with no word of where he is.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.269
You watch yourself.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.527
I guess she didn't get no mail.

14:22.528 --> 14:26.198
And when they start putting rings
in Cracker Jack boxes?

14:27.283 --> 14:30.910
<i>Thousands of WACs,
trained and disciplined the Army way,</i>

14:30.911 --> 14:34.581
<i>are now on duty
all over this country and overseas.</i>

14:34.582 --> 14:38.167
<i>But thousands more are needed.
Women from all walks of life.</i>

14:38.168 --> 14:41.671
<i>Salesgirls,
industrial workers, librarians,</i>

14:41.672 --> 14:43.464
<i>housewives, entertainers...</i>

14:43.465 --> 14:46.009
- Put that away and pay attention, Lena.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.511
<i>...all creeds,
for the next big step in their new life.</i>

14:48.512 --> 14:50.013
<i>Ready to serve with the Army,</i>

14:50.014 --> 14:53.057
<i>to do the jobs
the Army thinks they do best.</i>

14:53.058 --> 14:54.810
<i>Some do officers' training school...</i>

15:20.461 --> 15:21.295
Excuse me?

15:23.255 --> 15:24.089
Oh!

15:24.798 --> 15:25.674
Sorry.

15:32.097 --> 15:32.932
Mama?

15:37.478 --> 15:38.854
Was that Mr. David's car?

15:39.355 --> 15:40.814
Uh, come and sit.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.864
Mr. David brought this by for you.

16:12.429 --> 16:14.556
- Mama!
- I know, baby, I know.

16:49.633 --> 16:53.095
She ain't talk much
at all for weeks.

16:53.971 --> 16:55.139
Yeah, I know.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.725
She just closed off.

16:58.934 --> 17:00.728
That poor boy.

17:01.478 --> 17:04.273
They've been knowing one another
since they were little.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.360
Seemed like he just got there. Mm.

17:09.236 --> 17:13.198
Well, I sure hope Lionel comes back
with money for her schooling.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.368
At least we can give her that.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.247
- Has he ever come back with any money?
- Don't do that.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.001
Shh.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.545
Thought you was sleeping.

17:27.296 --> 17:28.714
Probably couldn't, huh?

17:33.135 --> 17:35.763
Mama, I made a decision.

17:36.972 --> 17:37.806
Okay.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.061
After I graduate...

17:44.688 --> 17:46.315
I'm going to join the Army.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.777
I wanna fight Hitler.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.201
Look at me, baby.

17:58.786 --> 18:02.623
I know you are hurtin' about Abram.
We all are.

18:03.957 --> 18:07.461
But that ain't no reason
for you to go to no Army.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.046
And from what I hear tell,

18:10.047 --> 18:13.382
ain't no Negro woman
doing nothing in no Army

18:13.383 --> 18:15.719
but cooking and cleaning
for the white folks.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.763
Hell, you can stay right here and do that.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.974
You is going to that university.

18:22.142 --> 18:23.185
With what money?

18:28.273 --> 18:29.942
I'm going to join the Army...

18:32.611 --> 18:33.987
as soon as I graduate.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.199
That's what I'm gonna do.

18:38.242 --> 18:41.494
- I don't have time, Mama.
- You have plenty of time.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.455
Stop fussing, Emma.
You're fussy, fussy, fussy.

18:44.456 --> 18:47.375
- Well, I think this is me.
- Is that--?

18:47.376 --> 18:51.254
Here. You take this.
And you be sure to eat, you hear?

18:51.255 --> 18:54.298
Susie, she already said
that she can only have one suitcase,

18:54.299 --> 18:56.259
and you've already put food in it.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.220
You gonna have her clothes
smelling like pork and beans.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.558
"Betty-Ann Morris. Susanne Jones."

19:03.225 --> 19:04.308
"Lena Derriecott."

19:04.309 --> 19:06.602
- Yes, sir. That's me.
- It's time to board.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.355
- We gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you too.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.815
We love you.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.568
- I love you too.
- I love you.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.570
- I'll write.
- Write me.

19:15.571 --> 19:16.613
- Promise.
- Okay.

19:17.823 --> 19:18.866
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.201
- Bye.
- Bye.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.422
I hope she's gonna be safe.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.506
She will.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.383
All aboard!

19:37.384 --> 19:40.012
Emma? You crying?

19:40.929 --> 19:45.350
They ain't gonna let no Negro women
near Europe, let alone Hitler.

19:45.934 --> 19:50.022
So you dry your eyes and come on.
She ain't going nowhere but to Georgia.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.275
I need you all to come with me.

19:54.943 --> 19:55.944
No, not you all.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.781
You over there, let's go.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.324
Are you coming?

20:01.325 --> 20:04.036
Well, I'm assuming
you're separating the white women.

20:04.870 --> 20:05.829
I am a Negro.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.463
Well, we must done crossed
the Mason-Dixon Line.

20:15.172 --> 20:17.215
Welcome to the South, ladies.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.885
Segregation is just
in them crackers' blood.

20:22.679 --> 20:25.264
You ain't said nothin'
since we been on this train.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.307
What's your name?

20:26.308 --> 20:28.852
Lena Derriecott. I'm from Philadelphia.

20:29.436 --> 20:31.521
Johnnie Mae Burton, mine. You?

20:32.022 --> 20:34.149
Bernice Baker. I'm from New York.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.276
And what about you, Miss Mulatto?

20:37.277 --> 20:39.028
She is not mulatto.

20:39.029 --> 20:42.698
Her mother is Mexican,
and her father is a Negro.

20:42.699 --> 20:45.326
He was my uncle. You are so rude.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.411
I didn't mean no harm.

20:47.412 --> 20:48.872
Sounded like that to me.

20:49.373 --> 20:52.500
I'm Dolores Washington.
This is my cousin, Elaine White.

20:52.501 --> 20:53.417
How do you do?

20:53.418 --> 20:54.336
Fine.

20:55.337 --> 20:56.838
Well, I'm just a little tired.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.758
Had to come up North and stay with my aunt
and her nine children in one room

21:00.759 --> 21:02.218
just to get in the Army.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.053
They wouldn't send me nowhere
in the South.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.722
Elaine, myself,
and four other Negro women took the test.

21:06.723 --> 21:08.057
We were told we all failed.

21:08.058 --> 21:11.186
I have spent three years
at Spelman College, and--

21:12.187 --> 21:14.647
And Dolores here is a whiz
who loves history.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.359
So I knew that couldn't be.
So you know what she did?

21:17.901 --> 21:21.446
She wrote a letter
directly to Mary McLeod Bethune.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.740
The Mary McLeod Bethune?

21:24.241 --> 21:25.366
Who is that?

21:25.367 --> 21:27.911
Oh Lord. Where you from?

21:29.579 --> 21:30.663
The country.

21:30.664 --> 21:34.250
Mary McLeod Bethune is head
of the National Council of Negro Women.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.127
She's on the president's Black cabinet,

21:36.128 --> 21:39.589
and she's close personal friends
with Eleanor Roosevelt herself.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.216
How am I supposed to know about a McLoud?

21:42.217 --> 21:44.011
It's McLeod.

21:44.803 --> 21:46.263
Y'all keep making fun of me.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.223
Worse than my husband.

22:26.762 --> 22:30.265
What are y'all waiting on?
Hurry up and get down from there.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.810
You mean to tell me I left home to deal
with the same bullshit in the Army?

22:34.811 --> 22:37.438
- How the hell we gonna get down?
- Come on.

22:37.439 --> 22:38.398
We'll help you.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.942
Ooh, I'm gonna like it here.

22:41.943 --> 22:42.944
I'll help you.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.582
Hi. I'm Hugh Bell.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.084
Lena Derriecott.

22:58.335 --> 23:01.880
Welcome. If you need anything at all,
I've been here a year.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.591
I know a lot, and I could show you around.

23:05.217 --> 23:09.054
You just gonna show her around?
We all wanna be showed around.

23:10.806 --> 23:11.640
Ma'am.

23:12.724 --> 23:14.475
All right, let's go. Ladies.

23:14.476 --> 23:17.479
Lord, you can help me anytime, shit.

23:19.773 --> 23:24.111
Johnnie Mae!
You should not use that language.

23:24.611 --> 23:25.861
What, you a preacher?

23:25.862 --> 23:27.114
My father is.

23:27.614 --> 23:30.116
Hm. Lord, I just got out of hell
to come to another hell.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.326
She trying to put me in a third hell.

23:32.327 --> 23:35.038
- We're just--
- She gonna cover her ears up.

23:36.039 --> 23:39.042
Make sure you have
your birth certificates in hand.

23:39.876 --> 23:41.461
You all, come with me.

23:44.297 --> 23:45.340
Right through there.

23:46.341 --> 23:47.551
Right through that door.

23:49.761 --> 23:50.637
Thank you.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.645
One more meal,
and you'll be over the weight limit.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.898
Roll up your sleeve
and get ready for your shot.

24:03.442 --> 24:04.317
Next.

24:07.863 --> 24:09.781
Damn, how long you gonna stick me?

24:20.167 --> 24:24.004
How is this supposed to fit us?
I can't get my titties in this.

24:24.588 --> 24:28.549
They are called breasts, Johnnie Mae.
Have some class.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.260
Them little things you got
is called breasts.

24:31.261 --> 24:33.387
This is Martha, this is Mary.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.389
These are titties.

24:35.390 --> 24:37.684
And they ain't going in this uniform.

24:41.438 --> 24:42.897
Well, this ain't much.

24:42.898 --> 24:46.193
Ah. Where'd you think you were going?
The Waldorf?

24:46.902 --> 24:48.695
She gonna leave me alone.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.450
Attention!

24:59.956 --> 25:01.458
You will hear that a lot.

25:02.834 --> 25:03.835
When you do,

25:04.836 --> 25:06.546
line up in front of a bunk,

25:07.422 --> 25:08.589
looking straight ahead.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.842
Do it now! Let's go!

25:11.426 --> 25:12.969
Attention!

25:30.362 --> 25:31.571
Soldiers,

25:32.614 --> 25:35.366
I am Captain Charity Adams,

25:35.367 --> 25:38.285
and I will be your commanding officer.

25:38.286 --> 25:42.706
What that means
is when I say "do it," you get it done.

25:42.707 --> 25:46.835
There are rules for the Army,
and they must be abided.

25:46.836 --> 25:48.338
And they are strict.

25:48.838 --> 25:53.677
I expect you to follow them to the letter.
No exceptions. None will be tolerated.

25:55.720 --> 25:59.306
We start training at 0630.
You have to be here at reveille.

25:59.307 --> 26:02.602
If you are on time, you are late,
so you must be early.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.606
Each of you has a locker and a trunk.

26:07.607 --> 26:10.818
Everything you own
must fit inside those two items.

26:10.819 --> 26:13.737
You will not wear complicated makeup.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.281
You have to shave your legs.

26:15.282 --> 26:19.493
You must use deodorant,
and you must shower at least once a day.

26:19.494 --> 26:22.914
And if you do not know
how to use a tampon, we will teach you.

26:25.083 --> 26:27.168
You have to stand up straight.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.422
Posture is important.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.925
We walk with our head up,

26:34.509 --> 26:37.386
our back straight, and our butt in.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.013
That is how we walk.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.431
Your uniform must be perfect.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.268
Lieutenant Campbell will teach you
how to make them perfect.

26:45.395 --> 26:48.063
These uniforms were designed
for the pencil figure of a white woman,

26:48.064 --> 26:49.690
not the curves of a Negro.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.442
But I am sure that more than a few of us

26:51.443 --> 26:53.485
know how to make use
of a needle and thread,

26:53.486 --> 26:56.196
and so we will make them perfect.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.240
They must be perfect.

26:58.241 --> 26:59.491
No exceptions.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.619
You are not only in the Army,

27:01.620 --> 27:04.663
you are women, and you are Negroes.

27:04.664 --> 27:06.248
Because you are Negroes and women,

27:06.249 --> 27:09.501
you do not have the luxury
to be as good as the white soldiers.

27:09.502 --> 27:11.630
You have the burden to be better.

27:12.339 --> 27:14.256
You are not only representing America,

27:14.257 --> 27:17.969
you are representing
the Negroes of America.

27:20.305 --> 27:22.057
Welcome to the Women's Army Corps.

28:02.305 --> 28:04.099
- Mrs. Roosevelt.
- Hello, George.

28:04.599 --> 28:05.892
Where's my husband?

28:06.643 --> 28:09.396
- He's in the Oval, in a meeting, ma'am.
- Very well.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.272
George, who's that woman by the gates?

28:12.273 --> 28:15.401
I'm not sure, ma'am.
She's been there for two days now.

28:15.402 --> 28:16.403
Really?

28:17.278 --> 28:18.862
What does she want?

28:18.863 --> 28:21.408
I'm not sure.
Would you like me to find out, ma'am?

28:22.492 --> 28:23.868
Yes, George. Thank you.

29:18.339 --> 29:20.592
Look alive, ladies!

29:21.384 --> 29:24.595
There are photographers around
at all times,

29:24.596 --> 29:26.972
taking photos of you,

29:26.973 --> 29:30.184
watching you, reportin' on you.

29:30.185 --> 29:33.479
A lot of people do not want us to succeed.

29:33.480 --> 29:36.065
A lot of people do not want us here.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.569
Private, your hat is too high.

29:40.403 --> 29:42.530
Unlike some other folks here,

29:43.573 --> 29:46.075
we have the most to prove.

29:46.659 --> 29:51.039
Now... now is where you show the proof.

29:51.748 --> 29:55.585
I will not tolerate
fighting and bickering among you.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.630
I will not tolerate disrespect.

30:00.507 --> 30:02.549
I will not lie to you,

30:02.550 --> 30:07.388
and you will not lie to me
without extreme consequences.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.476
Get your arms up, Private!

30:13.353 --> 30:17.565
Now, if you are thinking that
I am being hard on you, you are correct.

30:18.066 --> 30:21.902
But that is because
I am giving you my best,

30:21.903 --> 30:23.821
and you will give me yours.

30:23.822 --> 30:26.281
I don't think that's your best, Private.

30:26.282 --> 30:27.826
Get moving.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.203
Stop!

30:31.663 --> 30:32.497
You three.

30:33.331 --> 30:35.333
You, you, and you, come here.

30:42.173 --> 30:45.968
I need women soldiers
who know what it feels like to struggle.

30:45.969 --> 30:49.012
Who, from the moment they were born,
have had to fight to survive.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.889
This is your first strike.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.767
Three, and you are out of here.

30:53.643 --> 30:54.561
Am I clear?

30:55.812 --> 30:56.980
Understand?

30:57.564 --> 30:58.438
Yes, Captain.

30:58.439 --> 30:59.607
Fall in line.

31:02.527 --> 31:05.113
Let's go, ladies! Let's try this again!

31:06.447 --> 31:07.574
Arms up!

31:09.033 --> 31:11.578
Show me you have some fight in you!

31:13.872 --> 31:17.833
Come on, ladies!
Are you at war, or are you taking a nap?

31:17.834 --> 31:19.918
- To the top!
- Let's go!

31:19.919 --> 31:22.046
Let's go! Pick up the pace!

31:22.630 --> 31:23.463
Pick it up!

31:23.464 --> 31:27.134
Seven, eight, nine, ten!

31:27.135 --> 31:30.305
Let's go! Let's go! Pick up the pace!

31:30.972 --> 31:32.432
Keep your heads down!

31:34.183 --> 31:35.934
Let's go, ladies!

31:35.935 --> 31:37.353
Pick up the pace!

31:38.104 --> 31:39.229
Move, move, move!

31:39.230 --> 31:40.939
- This is not a tea party!
- Let's go!

31:40.940 --> 31:42.482
- Heads down!
- Come on!

31:42.483 --> 31:45.360
- I wanna see your best!
- Girl, move!

31:45.361 --> 31:47.446
I don't wanna be looking up your tail!

31:47.447 --> 31:50.575
You trying to get shot too?
I ain't going home 'cause of you.

31:51.075 --> 31:54.328
Let's go! Let's go! Pick up the pace!

31:54.329 --> 31:55.871
Come on, Lena, you can do this.

31:55.872 --> 31:58.081
- Let's go, ladies, let's go!
- Come on!

31:58.082 --> 31:59.374
Come on!

31:59.375 --> 32:01.335
Come on, ladies, give me your best!

32:01.336 --> 32:02.420
Let's go!

32:09.636 --> 32:10.929
Let's go, ladies!

32:32.825 --> 32:35.703
George,
she's out there in the rain.

32:38.998 --> 32:41.083
Did we find out what she wants?

32:41.084 --> 32:43.836
She said she's been waiting
to see you, ma'am.

32:47.632 --> 32:50.009
- Get me an umbrella, please.
- Yes, ma'am.

32:57.767 --> 33:00.269
- George, cover her with your umbrella.
- Yes, ma'am.

33:02.230 --> 33:03.147
Thank you, sir.

33:05.024 --> 33:08.694
Hello. You are going to catch
a terrible cold out here.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.905
- You've been out here for days.
- I was wanting to see you.

33:11.906 --> 33:13.866
This must be very important.

33:14.659 --> 33:15.742
I'm from West Virginia.

33:15.743 --> 33:21.039
My husband is a coal miner,
and I know we're nobodies in this world.

33:21.040 --> 33:23.083
No, everybody is somebody.

33:23.084 --> 33:25.460
Well, I just don't know what else to do.

33:25.461 --> 33:31.466
This is a photograph
of my son Vernon and his brother Elmer.

33:31.467 --> 33:33.927
- Oh, beautiful.
- Thank you, ma'am.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.096
They left to fight in the war
three years ago,

33:36.097 --> 33:38.933
and I haven't heard from them since.

33:40.101 --> 33:43.145
I don't know what to do.
I'm just worried out of my mind.

33:43.146 --> 33:45.355
Well, you should write to them.

33:45.356 --> 33:48.817
I write all the time,
but I never hear back.

33:48.818 --> 33:50.111
No letters, nothing.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.446
Why is that?

33:52.447 --> 33:56.200
Mrs. Roosevelt,
this is happening all over the country.

33:56.701 --> 34:00.329
We are not hearing from
or able to get word to them.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.916
Well, this can't be.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.753
Come on inside and tell me all about it.

34:07.754 --> 34:10.131
Thank you, ma'am. Thank you.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.187
What the hell?

34:25.188 --> 34:27.439
Girl, what have you done to your breasts?

34:27.440 --> 34:30.400
I bound them. That's the only way
they're gonna fit in this uniform.

34:30.401 --> 34:33.445
Elaine, you can sew real well.
Can you fix it for her?

34:33.446 --> 34:36.491
Uh-uh. I don't want her
doing nothing for me.

34:38.117 --> 34:39.869
You hush. Give me the shirt.

34:41.204 --> 34:44.873
My feet hurt so bad.
It's worse than working in a cotton mill.

34:44.874 --> 34:47.542
I thought coming here
would be a little change from that.

34:47.543 --> 34:48.960
Is that why you came?

34:48.961 --> 34:52.673
That, and that nigga hit me
one too many time.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.717
Language!

34:55.426 --> 34:57.553
Why did you come?

34:58.137 --> 35:00.890
I wanna go to school
and at the same time help our country.

35:01.641 --> 35:04.267
Same.
I'd like to get my master's in history.

35:04.268 --> 35:07.438
I don't know about helping no country
that treat us like shit.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.650
You got to lighten up,
preacher's daughter.

35:11.651 --> 35:15.238
Johnnie Mae,
I have always been a proper young lady.

35:15.822 --> 35:18.658
You should try it.
You shouldn't be using that language.

35:20.201 --> 35:23.036
Well, you go on and be
who the preacher taught you to be.

35:23.037 --> 35:24.539
I'm gonna be Johnnie Mae.

35:25.206 --> 35:27.374
If you're angry with your country,
why be here?

35:27.375 --> 35:30.418
Ain't no jobs for me
but working in a field, cotton mill,

35:30.419 --> 35:31.879
or some white folk kitchen.

35:32.380 --> 35:34.256
So I said I might as well.

35:34.257 --> 35:36.634
- Lena. Why did you come?
- Hm?

35:38.678 --> 35:40.638
I wanna help my country too.

35:41.597 --> 35:42.849
I wanna fight Hitler.

35:43.599 --> 35:47.353
Lord, chile,
I don't believe that, not one bit.

35:48.521 --> 35:49.605
What?

35:50.273 --> 35:54.025
Hey, ladies, why did y'all come here?

35:54.026 --> 35:56.987
- Draft was gonna take my fiancé.
- Fight for my country.

35:56.988 --> 36:00.240
Girl, shoot, I'm trying to bring
my husband home soon.

36:00.241 --> 36:03.577
- Wasn't nothing for me in Texas.
- I wanted to go to school.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.037
- Me too.
- I wanted to travel the world.

36:06.038 --> 36:09.709
Good luck with that.
Y'all made it to Georgia.

36:11.085 --> 36:14.463
Now, while some of y'all lying,

36:15.256 --> 36:18.717
I'm gonna tell y'all
the real reason why I came.

36:18.718 --> 36:19.634
Why?

36:19.635 --> 36:22.430
For the men.

36:33.065 --> 36:37.319
They are sending
another white unit to Europe?

36:37.320 --> 36:39.030
Yes, I can see that, Lieutenant.

36:40.072 --> 36:42.490
And you know
they are not half as qualified.

36:42.491 --> 36:43.742
I know.

36:43.743 --> 36:45.494
I've been asking for orders.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.079
We can't be doing all this in vain,

36:48.080 --> 36:51.751
but I don't know what else to do
to show them we are ready.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.821
This right here is not helping.

37:25.117 --> 37:26.409
Get up on your feet!

37:26.410 --> 37:29.663
Now, Miss Lena.
This is no way to get to fight Hitler.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.831
You have to be strong.

37:31.832 --> 37:33.583
- Come on, you can do it.
- Get up!

37:33.584 --> 37:35.168
- I'm trying.
- Not...

37:35.169 --> 37:36.254
<i>...</i> hard enough!

37:39.590 --> 37:42.217
You are embarrassing your entire race.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.261
They are already of the opinion

37:44.262 --> 37:47.806
that the Negro woman
is dumb, inferior, and lazy.

37:47.807 --> 37:51.559
And I'll be damned if I allow a woman
in my unit to prove them correct.

37:51.560 --> 37:55.272
Now you answer my question.
Are you dumb or inferior or lazy?

37:55.273 --> 37:56.439
No, ma'am.

37:56.440 --> 37:59.442
Well then, do you just wanna go home?

37:59.443 --> 38:01.904
- No, ma'am. I have to stay here.
- Why?

38:03.281 --> 38:05.074
I wanna fight for my country.

38:05.574 --> 38:06.993
You wanna fight?

38:07.785 --> 38:10.036
You don't look like a fighter
down on this ground.

38:10.037 --> 38:12.247
You look like a child
who doesn't have what it takes

38:12.248 --> 38:15.250
to be in a unit
full of strong women soldiers.

38:15.251 --> 38:17.252
This is your second strike.

38:17.253 --> 38:20.046
Now, you get on up,
or you are out of here today.

38:20.047 --> 38:22.258
Hey, Lena, does she remind you of anybody?

38:24.969 --> 38:25.885
Mary Kathryn.

38:25.886 --> 38:28.054
And we know what to do with her.

38:28.055 --> 38:29.890
Vector.

38:31.225 --> 38:32.226
Niner.

38:33.436 --> 38:34.853
Niner west.

38:34.854 --> 38:36.105
Get on up, soldier.

38:51.954 --> 38:54.415
You better eat.
You're gonna need your strength.

38:54.999 --> 38:56.083
She's right, Lena.

38:56.959 --> 39:00.795
She should just go on and quit.
Captain Adams don't like her anyway.

39:00.796 --> 39:04.467
- Why would you say that to her?
- It's true. She don't.

39:05.676 --> 39:08.720
- You are not a nice person at all.
- I'm honest.

39:08.721 --> 39:12.224
Don't you listen to her.
You're gonna make it. You will.

39:12.975 --> 39:15.019
And he always looking at you.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.979
Johnnie Mae, are you jealous of her?

39:17.980 --> 39:20.983
Girl, hush.
If I wanted him, I could have him.

39:21.817 --> 39:25.362
I ain't jealous of her skinny tail.
She ain't worried about him no way.

39:25.363 --> 39:28.366
Only thing she think about is that Abram.

39:32.453 --> 39:33.537
What did you say?

39:35.581 --> 39:38.500
I bunk next to you.
You call his name every night.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.251
Hell, I can't get no sleep.

39:40.252 --> 39:41.836
Abram this, Abram that.

39:41.837 --> 39:44.547
"Where are you, Abram? Abram, where are--"

39:44.548 --> 39:47.134
Don't you dare mention his name again.

39:49.053 --> 39:53.515
Now, I have let you push me around
and say all kinds of things,

39:53.516 --> 39:55.518
but don't you dare say his name.

40:01.649 --> 40:03.526
- You deserved that.
- Mm-hmm.

40:11.283 --> 40:14.077
This is the office of Colonel Davenport.
May I take a message?

40:14.078 --> 40:15.870
<i>...jobs the Army way now begins.</i>

40:15.871 --> 40:18.623
<i>WACs, fit, alert, proud of their corps,</i>

40:18.624 --> 40:21.042
<i>prepared for the next big step
in their new life.</i>

40:21.043 --> 40:23.420
<i>Replacing soldiers at switchboards.</i>

40:23.421 --> 40:26.256
<i>Serving as dispatchers
for various branches of the Army.</i>

40:26.257 --> 40:28.842
<i>Motor transport,
where women have proved their ability</i>

40:28.843 --> 40:30.760
<i>to maintain and repair cars and trucks.</i>

40:30.761 --> 40:32.846
<i>They're good drivers and mechanics.</i>

40:32.847 --> 40:34.305
<i>In Army motor pools.</i>

40:34.306 --> 40:38.184
<i>In these and many other fields,
taking over important jobs for the Army.</i>

40:38.185 --> 40:42.231
<i>Through these replacements,
playing a vital role in winning the war.</i>

40:50.072 --> 40:50.906
At ease.

40:59.540 --> 41:01.500
- You wanted to see me, Adams?
- Yes, sir.

41:02.418 --> 41:03.794
I know you are persistent.

41:05.880 --> 41:07.922
If this has anything to do
with you having orders--

41:07.923 --> 41:09.133
It does, sir.

41:10.134 --> 41:12.093
I have graduated hundreds of women,

41:12.094 --> 41:14.888
and this month,
another 38 are about to do the same.

41:14.889 --> 41:19.435
As you know, I have a 97% success rate.
We are ready to be called to duty, sir.

41:20.853 --> 41:22.688
Are you sure about that?

41:24.857 --> 41:26.817
I don't think you're ready
for an assignment.

41:27.651 --> 41:30.570
Sir, with all due respect,
the white women--

41:30.571 --> 41:31.739
They're more qualified.

41:33.532 --> 41:35.534
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a meeting.

41:36.243 --> 41:38.078
- Sir, I--
- I have a meeting.

41:39.622 --> 41:40.456
Yes, sir.

41:49.757 --> 41:50.591
She is--

41:52.510 --> 41:55.221
Gentlemen, you know my wife.

41:55.888 --> 41:58.724
And this is Mary McLeod Bethune.

41:59.225 --> 42:00.351
Please be seated.

42:00.935 --> 42:02.352
I'll get right down to it.

42:02.353 --> 42:03.561
Over the past few weeks,

42:03.562 --> 42:08.608
my wife and I have been talking about
the problems we are having with the mail

42:08.609 --> 42:11.320
and our soldiers' morale.

42:12.947 --> 42:13.821
Care to explain?

42:13.822 --> 42:17.033
There has been
a serious blockage in the mail,

42:17.034 --> 42:20.703
simply because we have needed
every available vehicle

42:20.704 --> 42:23.082
to bring supplies to the front lines.

42:23.582 --> 42:27.043
General Halt here can speak
to the magnitude of the issue.

42:27.044 --> 42:29.087
- General?
- Uh, yes, sir.

42:29.088 --> 42:33.676
Now, Mr. President, helping our soldiers
win the war is our priority.

42:34.510 --> 42:35.677
Um...

42:35.678 --> 42:40.056
The mail had to take
a lesser rank of importance.

42:40.057 --> 42:41.724
I understand that.

42:41.725 --> 42:45.228
What I don't understand
is how anyone in this room

42:45.229 --> 42:50.149
cannot see the importance of something
as simple as a letter from home

42:50.150 --> 42:52.360
and what it can do for morale.

42:52.361 --> 42:55.989
This is the only way they can communicate
outside of the battle.

42:55.990 --> 42:59.285
But the orders at hand
are the most important ones,

42:59.785 --> 43:01.828
for the supplies for the front lines.

43:01.829 --> 43:04.164
So are you saying to me

43:04.832 --> 43:08.502
that there is no way
to get the mail to these men?

43:09.587 --> 43:11.755
That is unacceptable.

43:13.340 --> 43:14.216
Mary.

43:14.800 --> 43:16.594
As I travel the country,

43:17.636 --> 43:21.223
these are the same stories
I hear everywhere.

43:21.849 --> 43:24.768
Worried parents, wives,

43:25.519 --> 43:27.478
children, loved ones,

43:27.479 --> 43:31.149
all wondering
why they haven't received any mail.

43:31.150 --> 43:34.360
Not one letter or so much as a postcard

43:34.361 --> 43:37.030
from the men
who've been fighting for our country--

43:37.031 --> 43:38.656
Mr. President, I can assure you

43:38.657 --> 43:43.286
that we have, uh, put many companies
on this assignment,

43:43.287 --> 43:46.582
but it has proven to be
a logistical nightmare at this point.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.294
We even tried the Women's Army Corps.

43:51.170 --> 43:54.548
You mean the white Women's Army Corps?

43:57.217 --> 43:58.594
Well, is there another?

44:04.725 --> 44:06.810
Are you not aware, General,

44:07.311 --> 44:11.440
there are Negro women serving
in the Women's Army Corps?

44:13.400 --> 44:15.569
But this mail situation is complicated.

44:16.070 --> 44:19.406
Not as simple as just dropping
some letters in the mailbox.

44:20.115 --> 44:23.660
There are reasons
for the backlog that are there.

44:23.661 --> 44:27.706
Well, it'd require a great deal of skill

44:28.207 --> 44:30.292
to be able to sort it all out.

44:30.793 --> 44:32.753
With all due respect, General,

44:33.462 --> 44:39.343
the Negro women of the Women's Army Corps
are very smart women,

44:39.968 --> 44:43.013
being led by a remarkable Negro woman,

44:43.514 --> 44:46.015
Captain Charity Adams.

44:46.016 --> 44:47.475
She's brilliant.

44:47.476 --> 44:51.897
She has a triple major
in physics, mathematics, Latin.

44:52.398 --> 44:54.774
So I assure you, Mr. President,

44:54.775 --> 44:57.568
the Negro women of the WAC unit

44:57.569 --> 45:01.448
possess the skills and the leadership

45:02.658 --> 45:04.785
to get this mail delivered.

45:14.837 --> 45:15.670
There he is!

45:15.671 --> 45:18.506
Ooh.
You go on, we'll hold you a seat.

45:18.507 --> 45:19.675
Do you like him?

45:20.467 --> 45:21.634
Seems nice enough.

45:21.635 --> 45:24.095
She like him.
But he ain't that boy back home.

45:24.096 --> 45:26.139
- Don't you say his name.
- I ain't.

45:26.140 --> 45:27.766
Go on, talk to him.

45:30.185 --> 45:31.853
Hey, Private.

45:31.854 --> 45:33.105
Hello, ladies.

45:34.982 --> 45:35.816
Hi.

45:36.692 --> 45:38.693
Good to see you come out
and have some fun.

45:38.694 --> 45:40.695
I've been hoping
to see you here for weeks.

45:40.696 --> 45:43.448
And congratulations on making it through.

45:43.449 --> 45:46.577
Barely. I'm still not as good
as the other ladies.

45:47.077 --> 45:48.996
I think you're stronger than you know.

45:50.289 --> 45:51.123
Thank you.

45:52.040 --> 45:53.541
But you don't know me.

45:53.542 --> 45:56.170
- I know your name is Lena Derriecott.
- Mm.

45:56.795 --> 45:59.047
Came from a town outside Philadelphia.

46:00.215 --> 46:03.218
You like jasmine perfume,
and you don't like milk.

46:03.886 --> 46:06.262
You add up the pounds of fuel
really fast on the airplane,

46:06.263 --> 46:07.848
and you know a lot about them.

46:08.724 --> 46:11.894
And you are here to prove something
to more than just yourself.

46:14.396 --> 46:16.189
How do you know all of that?

46:16.190 --> 46:17.107
It's just...

46:18.567 --> 46:20.109
when a man like me sees a woman

46:20.110 --> 46:22.738
who makes him question
his next big decisions,

46:23.655 --> 46:24.948
I wanna find out why.

46:26.283 --> 46:27.659
What are you talking about?

46:28.994 --> 46:30.537
This is gonna sound crazy,

46:31.663 --> 46:33.748
but I'm supposed to get married
next weekend.

46:33.749 --> 46:36.043
I wasn't sure about it at all,

46:36.543 --> 46:38.836
and then I saw you.
Now I'm really not sure.

46:38.837 --> 46:42.340
My mother and my aunt told me
about men like you, smooth talkers.

46:42.341 --> 46:43.884
Excuse me.

46:44.760 --> 46:48.096
I promise I'm telling you
the truth, Miss Lena.

46:49.097 --> 46:50.724
Can we sit together inside?

46:58.690 --> 47:00.526
Now, what are y'all doing here?

47:01.401 --> 47:04.654
Well, it looks to me
like we are about to watch a movie.

47:04.655 --> 47:05.989
Not from these seats.

47:06.949 --> 47:08.407
They can all go to the back.

47:08.408 --> 47:13.329
Well now, I am an officer,
and I chose these seats.

47:13.330 --> 47:15.957
My ladies are not moving,
Captain Matthews.

47:15.958 --> 47:18.084
Mm. I heard about you.

47:18.085 --> 47:20.379
- Mm.
- You're the troublemaker.

47:21.964 --> 47:23.674
Always trying to find a fight.

47:24.299 --> 47:26.342
Always ready for one.

47:26.343 --> 47:27.719
Hm.

47:29.096 --> 47:31.639
We are not moving.
You all can sit in the back.

47:31.640 --> 47:35.018
We don't need to listen
to the likes of you, nigger.

47:35.602 --> 47:37.688
You son of a bitch! I will--

47:38.188 --> 47:39.940
You will do nothing.

47:40.691 --> 47:42.692
<i>...of which Germany
gambled everything.</i>

47:42.693 --> 47:43.651
Sit down.

47:43.652 --> 47:45.945
Come on, boys.
Let's leave these coons.

47:45.946 --> 47:50.157
No. I don't know who you think you are,
but this is the United States Army.

47:50.158 --> 47:52.410
I will not have this disrespect.
Give me your name!

47:52.411 --> 47:54.705
Who the hell do you think you are?

47:55.372 --> 47:59.584
I am Captain Charity Adams,

47:59.585 --> 48:02.963
and you will salute me.

48:03.797 --> 48:05.966
That ain't never gonna happen.

48:12.180 --> 48:13.265
Get my hat.

48:14.141 --> 48:15.058
You!

48:17.352 --> 48:19.103
I'm sorry, Captain Adams.

48:19.104 --> 48:22.690
It's just when them crackers
be coming at me, I just see red.

48:22.691 --> 48:25.234
You don't think
we all feel that way sometimes?

48:25.235 --> 48:28.696
I don't care what they do.
You don't let them bait you.

48:28.697 --> 48:32.200
Because you in this uniform,
you must behave!

48:32.910 --> 48:34.911
They will be court-martialed,

48:34.912 --> 48:38.165
but you can never ever give them
what they want.

48:42.002 --> 48:43.502
Adams. What is it?

48:43.503 --> 48:45.463
Sir, my ladies were harassed

48:45.464 --> 48:47.798
and asked to move from their seats
at the theater.

48:47.799 --> 48:50.176
Several white soldiers,
including Captain Matthews,

48:50.177 --> 48:52.428
were insulting and disrespectful.

48:52.429 --> 48:54.138
I will not stand for this bigotry.

48:54.139 --> 48:56.223
We have the same rights
as any white soldier.

48:56.224 --> 48:59.645
- Anything less is inexcusable.
- Can you give it a rest?

49:01.730 --> 49:03.940
Sir, with all due respect,
we are treated like--

49:03.941 --> 49:04.982
I have orders for you.

49:04.983 --> 49:07.526
You and the Six Triple Eight Battalion
are headed to Europe.

49:07.527 --> 49:09.111
You'll head out tomorrow by plane,

49:09.112 --> 49:11.614
and your troops
will arrive by boat on the 11th.

49:11.615 --> 49:12.908
Here are your orders.

49:13.408 --> 49:17.454
You are not to open this until you are
on the plane and over the Atlantic.

49:19.873 --> 49:20.749
Dismissed.

49:24.795 --> 49:25.671
Susie!

49:29.716 --> 49:31.425
- You lied to me.
- What?

49:31.426 --> 49:33.678
They are shipping Lena to Europe.

49:33.679 --> 49:34.596
What?

49:35.222 --> 49:36.306
There.

49:46.858 --> 49:48.652
It's a lot of water.

49:54.032 --> 49:56.367
How are you so calm? You been drinking?

49:56.368 --> 49:57.327
No.

49:57.869 --> 50:00.539
I was about to say, "Give me some."

50:04.668 --> 50:05.919
Should you open it?

50:07.212 --> 50:09.089
Well, I don't wanna be the first one.

50:10.632 --> 50:13.635
And all of them have two envelopes,
but we only have one.

50:14.136 --> 50:16.263
I can't figure out
what the other one says.

50:20.600 --> 50:22.143
One's from the Army...

50:22.144 --> 50:23.103
Abbie.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.856
...one's from the War Department.

50:27.733 --> 50:30.819
They're sending us without proper orders
from the War Department?

50:33.780 --> 50:34.739
Looks that way to me.

50:34.740 --> 50:36.699
You can't command troops unless you have--

50:36.700 --> 50:38.326
War Department orders. I know.

50:41.997 --> 50:42.831
There.

50:51.423 --> 50:53.216
The Postal Battalion?

50:54.760 --> 50:58.221
They think the only thing we good for
is deliver some damn mail.

50:59.139 --> 51:00.515
Shit.

51:01.558 --> 51:05.312
So they have a Negro at the Oval Office,

51:06.605 --> 51:09.523
telling me these women
could do this job.

51:09.524 --> 51:14.821
I tell you, took all I had
to keep myself together.

51:17.115 --> 51:21.369
I mean, they think a bunch
of Negro women can do this job?

51:23.663 --> 51:25.832
They have to be reasonably intelligent.

51:26.374 --> 51:27.250
Reasonably.

51:28.627 --> 51:32.089
And I never seen a smart Negro,

51:32.923 --> 51:34.299
let alone a woman one.

51:36.009 --> 51:37.719
Well, they have arrived, sir.

51:38.970 --> 51:40.221
Oh well, go get 'em.

51:40.222 --> 51:42.473
It's your idea to give them a reception.

51:42.474 --> 51:44.642
Anything that can get me drinking.

51:44.643 --> 51:47.186
General, this is Major Charity Adams.

51:47.187 --> 51:48.146
At ease.

51:49.689 --> 51:50.565
So...

51:52.359 --> 51:54.945
you're the infamous Adams.

51:56.029 --> 51:57.905
I don't know about infamous, sir.

51:57.906 --> 51:59.199
Oh no.

52:00.075 --> 52:04.537
I heard about your antics
at the base around, uh, integration,

52:04.538 --> 52:06.288
drinking at white fountains,

52:06.289 --> 52:08.707
the thing at the Post Theater, and so on.

52:08.708 --> 52:11.418
Now they promoted you to major.

52:11.419 --> 52:14.046
- So do you know why you're here?
- Yes, sir.

52:14.047 --> 52:16.882
Although I still have not gotten orders
from the War Department, sir.

52:16.883 --> 52:20.469
No, never mind that. They'll come.
I was talking about the assignment.

52:20.470 --> 52:24.474
Yes, sir. We were told we are here
to redirect the mail, sir?

52:24.975 --> 52:27.601
And y'all are confident
that, uh, you can do the job

52:27.602 --> 52:31.481
in the short six months we've allotted?

52:31.982 --> 52:35.652
Six months seems generous, sir,
so yes, I believe we can.

52:36.153 --> 52:37.737
Well, you hear that, gentlemen?

52:38.780 --> 52:39.864
They can do it.

52:39.865 --> 52:42.324
Six months is generous.

52:42.325 --> 52:44.910
And your troops are, uh, on the way.

52:44.911 --> 52:49.623
They're on the Île de France,
so they're comfortable.

52:49.624 --> 52:51.084
It's a very nice ship.

52:52.210 --> 52:54.504
It can, uh, turn on a dime

52:55.005 --> 52:57.840
if a German U-boat was in the area,
or any other danger.

52:57.841 --> 52:58.924
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

52:58.925 --> 53:01.636
And it can outmaneuver, quickly,

53:02.554 --> 53:04.306
an incoming torpedo.

53:04.973 --> 53:08.101
Well, sir, I'm sure between that
and their escorts,

53:08.602 --> 53:10.352
I'm sure they will get here safely.

53:10.353 --> 53:11.563
There's no escorts.

53:12.147 --> 53:16.192
And unfortunately, the, uh, place
where your troops were to be housed

53:16.193 --> 53:18.694
was, uh, bombed just before your arrival.

53:18.695 --> 53:19.778
But don't you worry,

53:19.779 --> 53:22.323
I personally approved accommodations

53:22.324 --> 53:26.493
that I'm sure you gonna find appropriate.

53:26.494 --> 53:27.662
Thank you, sir.

53:29.748 --> 53:30.998
Can the troops march?

53:30.999 --> 53:32.291
Yes, sir.

53:32.292 --> 53:35.462
I have the best marching troop
you have ever seen, sir.

53:38.840 --> 53:41.843
Your troops will be marching off the ship
upon their arrival.

53:45.722 --> 53:46.723
Come on, Lee.

54:18.797 --> 54:21.424
What does all this tossing and turning
remind you of?

54:23.093 --> 54:24.010
You,

54:24.970 --> 54:27.514
driving me in the back
of that rumble seat.

54:28.265 --> 54:30.267
We had so much fun.

54:31.893 --> 54:33.645
I knew you'd make it through.

54:35.105 --> 54:36.940
I also knew you'd come to find me.

54:38.358 --> 54:41.486
You can be determined when you want to,
Miss Lena Derriecott.

54:43.905 --> 54:46.074
I miss you so much, Abram.

54:48.827 --> 54:51.246
Hey, Lena,
hurry up with those towels.

55:17.605 --> 55:18.565
Oh my God!

55:24.195 --> 55:27.990
<i>We have 855 women
on a civilian ship,</i>

55:27.991 --> 55:30.868
no military escort,
zigzagging across the ocean,

55:30.869 --> 55:33.246
and he wants them to march right off?

55:33.788 --> 55:35.622
Lord Jesus.

55:35.623 --> 55:38.042
Noel, I asked for a mission.

55:38.043 --> 55:40.377
Well, it don't seem like
we ever gonna get a chance...

55:40.378 --> 55:41.587
Mm.

55:41.588 --> 55:42.963
...to prove 'em wrong.

55:42.964 --> 55:47.385
Especially not with something
as easy as delivering mail.

55:47.886 --> 55:50.179
And giving us six months to do it.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.473
That's because
they don't believe we can do it.

55:52.474 --> 55:53.891
These white men.

55:53.892 --> 55:55.392
Negro men too.

55:55.393 --> 55:56.727
Like Howard.

55:56.728 --> 55:58.520
Oh, please don't mention him.

55:58.521 --> 56:02.107
- I'm trying to forget him.
- Oh, girl, don't mention him.

56:02.108 --> 56:06.196
He was the worst mistake
I ever made in my life.

56:07.447 --> 56:08.907
What we looked like,

56:09.741 --> 56:14.995
sneaking out of the barracks
to catch him at the movies with...

56:14.996 --> 56:19.750
Norma Jean. Your nemesis.

56:19.751 --> 56:22.796
She was such a tramp.

56:23.755 --> 56:25.756
You were so mad when you saw him.

56:25.757 --> 56:29.593
I looked at the back of your head,
you still had a roller in it.

56:29.594 --> 56:31.012
See...

56:35.183 --> 56:39.562
Charity, you know those generals
were laughing for a reason, right?

56:40.063 --> 56:42.356
Mm-hm. Showing his whole hand.

56:42.357 --> 56:45.944
- And six months to seem generous?
- Mm.

56:47.654 --> 56:48.487
Yeah.

56:48.488 --> 56:50.448
Noel.
Hm?

56:51.908 --> 56:54.661
Oh, Noel,
where did they say that mail was?

57:00.041 --> 57:03.086
- Good evening, soldiers.
- Can I help you, ma'am?

57:09.300 --> 57:10.677
You will salute.

57:12.846 --> 57:13.972
Sorry, ma'am.

57:15.723 --> 57:17.100
So where's this mail?

57:17.892 --> 57:19.102
There's some in here.

57:22.355 --> 57:23.731
Well, soldiers, open the door.

57:36.286 --> 57:38.162
Would you like to see
all the hangars?

57:38.163 --> 57:39.414
They are all this full.

57:40.373 --> 57:41.624
How many are there?

57:43.126 --> 57:44.043
All of them.

57:49.007 --> 57:50.091
Oh my God.

58:08.276 --> 58:09.944
You trained them well.

58:11.613 --> 58:12.697
Fall in!

58:21.164 --> 58:23.124
Six Triple Eight Battalion!

58:24.834 --> 58:26.419
Dress right, dress!

58:32.217 --> 58:33.885
Ready, two.

58:35.386 --> 58:36.304
Cover!

58:39.724 --> 58:41.392
Ready, two!

58:45.313 --> 58:48.066
Now, I know you had a hard way over...

58:51.027 --> 58:52.529
and I know you're cold.

58:54.239 --> 58:56.407
Truth is, it will be cold.

58:59.369 --> 59:01.787
But we need to put all of that
out of our minds

59:01.788 --> 59:08.086
because we have been given an order
by General Halt to march today.

59:09.754 --> 59:11.130
Right now.

59:14.259 --> 59:16.176
And march we shall.

59:16.177 --> 59:17.387
Captain!

59:32.402 --> 59:35.321
Forward march!

01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:36.549
Company, halt!

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:45.224
Battalion, eyes right!

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.061
Present arm!

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:55.068
Ready, two!

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.738
Battalion, forward march!

01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:47.412
This mail has been sitting here
for over ten months.

01:01:49.288 --> 01:01:51.624
And not just in this airplane hangar,

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:54.209
in all of them.

01:01:54.210 --> 01:01:57.797
Every single hangar is full of mail.

01:01:58.381 --> 01:02:02.593
The soldiers who are fighting this war
have not heard from their loved ones,

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:06.347
and their loved ones
have not heard from them.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:12.060
Now, the War Department
is getting thousands of complaints,

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:15.397
and the morale of our soldiers
is at an all-time low.

01:02:15.398 --> 01:02:19.235
And if our soldiers have low morale,
they have no fight.

01:02:20.820 --> 01:02:26.659
Ladies, we have been ordered
to provide hope

01:02:27.243 --> 01:02:28.703
and communication

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:31.497
and care packages

01:02:32.081 --> 01:02:35.959
to our exhausted soldiers
on the front lines

01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:40.131
and to let their families back home
know if they are safe.

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:42.550
Or...

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.387
Or if they have died in battle.

01:02:49.056 --> 01:02:51.392
Now, I'm told

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:56.481
that a few have tried
to unravel this situation.

01:02:58.524 --> 01:03:00.026
But they could not do it...

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:03.488
so they sent us.

01:03:04.071 --> 01:03:08.242
But make no mistake, ladies,

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:13.663
they did not send us
because they thought we could do it.

01:03:13.664 --> 01:03:18.294
We are here
because they are sure we cannot.

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:23.757
They have only given us
a six-month ticking clock.

01:03:23.758 --> 01:03:25.550
And I thought that was a long time

01:03:25.551 --> 01:03:29.972
until I realized
the magnitude of this situation.

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:34.392
When there is no mail,
there is low morale.

01:03:34.393 --> 01:03:36.312
But all that said...

01:03:38.689 --> 01:03:42.568
...this is our mission,

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:46.030
and we will not fail.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:49.574
<i>Here's how
we will accomplish our mission.</i>

01:03:49.575 --> 01:03:51.868
<i>Our drivers will come here to the hangar.</i>

01:03:51.869 --> 01:03:54.162
<i>They will pick up the mail
and load it onto the trucks</i>

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:55.956
<i>according to Army number.</i>

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:58.708
<i>It will then be delivered
to our home base,</i>

01:03:58.709 --> 01:04:00.919
<i>which is the King Edward School.</i>

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.546
<i>I wanna warn you,</i>

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:06.591
<i>there's no need to complain
because I know about the vermin.</i>

01:04:06.592 --> 01:04:09.512
<i>I know that it is cold. There is no heat.</i>

01:04:10.221 --> 01:04:12.597
<i>But I also know that we are at war,</i>

01:04:12.598 --> 01:04:15.643
<i>and when you are at war, you make do.</i>

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:21.274
We are no strangers
to making a shack a home.

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:24.818
Most of our mothers
have had to do it as well.

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:29.615
So we will start by organizing a system
by which we process all this mail.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:32.994
And this is where we gonna do it.

01:05:28.007 --> 01:05:31.009
Now, as drivers,
you never ever leave this route.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:33.095
This is your way to and from the airfield.

01:06:04.543 --> 01:06:07.087
"It is hereby known
that Major Charity Adams

01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:10.298
is in full command
of the Six Triple Eight Battalion."

01:06:10.299 --> 01:06:14.177
- You finally got the orders?
- No. I got to thinking.

01:06:14.178 --> 01:06:17.347
They don't wanna give me orders
'cause they want us to be chaotic.

01:06:17.348 --> 01:06:20.850
I'm not waiting for them to tell me.
I'm telling them I took command.

01:06:20.851 --> 01:06:22.477
I wrote it myself.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:23.813
Send it in, Captain.

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:26.023
Yes, ma'am.

01:06:26.524 --> 01:06:30.860
<i>♪ This is the name of this song
It's called "Air Mail Special" ♪</i>

01:06:30.861 --> 01:06:35.157
<i>♪ Get on, get on
The special cargo air mail ♪</i>

01:06:56.637 --> 01:06:57.930
Bring it in!

01:06:58.931 --> 01:06:59.890
Let's go!

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:08.899
You know you're still calling that name
I'm not allowed to say again.

01:07:14.488 --> 01:07:17.700
I know some of you think
that this is impossible,

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:22.329
but there is only one way
to eat an elephant,

01:07:23.497 --> 01:07:26.709
and that is one bite at a time.

01:07:53.778 --> 01:07:56.196
Lena, you don't have to read
every name, you know.

01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:59.033
Look at the numbers.
That's the best way to get it organized.

01:08:01.202 --> 01:08:02.161
Oh.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:14.632
Hey!

01:08:15.883 --> 01:08:17.635
You don't do that.

01:08:21.847 --> 01:08:25.059
You don't just throw them over there.

01:08:26.268 --> 01:08:28.646
Those people have died!

01:08:30.064 --> 01:08:32.525
They need to be shown some respect.

01:08:48.124 --> 01:08:49.666
I'm sorry, Major Adams.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.919
May I please go to the latrine?

01:08:53.671 --> 01:08:54.547
You may.

01:08:58.175 --> 01:09:00.177
Back to work, ladies.

01:09:06.267 --> 01:09:08.602
I told you she was crazy.

01:09:09.186 --> 01:09:12.981
Been quiet as a mouse this whole time,
and now she wants to start screaming?

01:09:12.982 --> 01:09:15.234
She ain't gonna be hollering
at Johnnie Mae.

01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:16.986
You know what? I...

01:09:17.862 --> 01:09:19.613
I think I need to use the bathroom.

01:09:24.910 --> 01:09:26.703
Well, y'all gonna get in trouble.

01:09:26.704 --> 01:09:29.248
I ain't following that crazy tail
to the bathroom.

01:09:41.802 --> 01:09:43.052
- Lena?
- Ah.

01:09:43.053 --> 01:09:44.013
I'm all right.

01:09:44.763 --> 01:09:46.557
Doesn't look that way to me.

01:09:47.141 --> 01:09:48.601
Dry your eyes.

01:09:52.897 --> 01:09:53.772
I have to pee.

01:09:55.232 --> 01:09:56.567
You sure you're all right?

01:09:57.151 --> 01:09:58.902
No. It's that man.

01:09:58.903 --> 01:10:01.613
What'd he do? Break your heart
like my husband broke mine?

01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:03.199
Will you stop it?

01:10:04.825 --> 01:10:06.160
He's dead.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:12.833
He was, uh...

01:10:14.835 --> 01:10:16.253
shot down

01:10:17.338 --> 01:10:19.340
not long after he got here.

01:10:23.719 --> 01:10:25.638
He was a soldier...

01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:32.228
and he asked me
to wait for him to come home.

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:37.650
I am so sorry.

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:42.863
Oh God, I feel like a clock
that nobody can wind.

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:48.994
I mean, he promised me
that he would write,

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:52.039
and I never got any letters.

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:55.626
I know he did.

01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:03.300
I wonder if his letters to me
are in one of these bags.

01:11:04.802 --> 01:11:07.930
But I didn't know
we were gonna be doing all this.

01:11:14.937 --> 01:11:17.481
Oh, Lena. I'm so sorry.

01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:20.067
I wanna thank y'all.

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:25.739
I know you didn't know, but thank you...

01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:28.951
for helping me through this.

01:11:29.702 --> 01:11:31.077
Honey, you listen here.

01:11:31.078 --> 01:11:34.581
If there is a letter from him,
we will find it.

01:11:39.086 --> 01:11:41.964
We will all be looking
for anything addressed to you.

01:11:43.882 --> 01:11:47.093
It ain't no damn way
all these letters-- I'm so--

01:11:47.094 --> 01:11:49.263
You all had to go at the same time?

01:11:50.055 --> 01:11:52.016
- Sorry, Major Adams.
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:55.519
Not you.

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:00.274
I know...

01:12:03.319 --> 01:12:05.195
that you don't like me...

01:12:07.323 --> 01:12:09.116
'cause I embarrass the unit.

01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:13.370
But I promise you...

01:12:15.664 --> 01:12:17.708
I will do a great job with this.

01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.256
I know what these families
are going through.

01:12:25.132 --> 01:12:27.176
There's nothing worse than not knowing.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:31.846
- You're wrong.
- I promise you, I will--

01:12:31.847 --> 01:12:33.640
About me not liking you.

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:37.561
I like you.

01:12:38.604 --> 01:12:39.897
And I respect you.

01:12:41.023 --> 01:12:42.483
Now, in the beginning,

01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:45.361
I did worry about you.

01:12:45.986 --> 01:12:47.987
I wondered if you would make it through.

01:12:47.988 --> 01:12:50.573
But, Lena,
right when you were about to break,

01:12:50.574 --> 01:12:53.243
something showed up and took you further.

01:12:55.412 --> 01:12:57.498
And now I see what that was.

01:12:59.625 --> 01:13:02.795
Lena, you are a soldier.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:08.217
Now, Private,

01:13:09.134 --> 01:13:12.136
I take seriously every order
I have ever gotten in the Army,

01:13:12.137 --> 01:13:13.471
including this one,

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.431
but I will admit to you

01:13:15.432 --> 01:13:17.850
that I was insulted at first

01:13:17.851 --> 01:13:20.145
that they would only let us
handle the mail.

01:13:22.523 --> 01:13:25.317
But I understand now.

01:13:28.695 --> 01:13:34.367
Because I knew that it was important
for our soldiers and their families,

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:38.872
but nothing has put a face on this for me...

01:13:40.416 --> 01:13:42.835
like you have with what you shared today.

01:13:47.714 --> 01:13:48.549
Thank you.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:53.970
- Now get back to work.
- Yes, Major.

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:54.888
Mm-hmm.

01:14:03.355 --> 01:14:07.108
"We are two months
into our six-month clock."

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:10.653
"Major Adams, I do not need to tell you
how important this mission is."

01:14:10.654 --> 01:14:13.906
"There are a lot of people
counting on you and these women."

01:14:13.907 --> 01:14:16.075
"For what it's worth,
I know you can do this."

01:14:16.076 --> 01:14:19.620
"But this is not--" In all capitals.

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:20.621
"Not the way."

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:22.623
"General Halt was delighted to hear

01:14:22.624 --> 01:14:25.209
that every piece of mail
you have gotten out in the past few weeks

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.963
has been returned as undeliverable."

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:33.217
"He is sending telegrams
to the White House every day

01:14:33.218 --> 01:14:36.012
on your progress or lack thereof."

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:37.305
Shit.

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:39.765
I'm sure he is, General Halt.

01:14:39.766 --> 01:14:42.977
We sent out 57,000 pieces of mail.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:45.397
Yes, and all of them undeliverable.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:50.860
But, Charity, the soldiers
are moving around a lot in these battles.

01:14:50.861 --> 01:14:53.280
You think they gave us bad locator cards?

01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:56.575
Well, I know
they're not trying to help us.

01:15:00.078 --> 01:15:03.498
For just once, I'd like to play
on an even playing field

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:04.874
where everything is fair.

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:08.169
No tricks from white folks, just fairness.
Is fair too much to ask for?

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.838
No, it is not.

01:15:11.089 --> 01:15:14.592
But you and I both know
it ain't gonna change no time soon.

01:15:14.593 --> 01:15:17.637
This is part of making that change.

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:19.639
Did you see this last sentence?

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:21.182
"I reluctantly need to tell you

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:24.603
that he also wants you to host
the Negro soldiers on the weekends."

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:28.607
I look like a hostess to you?

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:41.345
Wow, how does she do that?

01:16:41.346 --> 01:16:43.723
She was a Whitney Lenny stepper in Harlem.

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:45.100
Look at her go!

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:55.569
Hey, okay!

01:17:04.494 --> 01:17:06.663
Lord, I need me some of this fun.

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:08.624
Johnnie Mae!

01:17:20.719 --> 01:17:23.513
- She is incorrigible.
- She is quite confident.

01:17:24.014 --> 01:17:27.058
I was gonna say a mess. I'm tired.

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:28.559
You're amazing.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:29.894
- So good.
- Thank you.

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:31.480
Come on, I want a drink.

01:17:32.064 --> 01:17:35.024
- Come on, Lena.
- Well, I've never had a drink.

01:17:35.025 --> 01:17:36.192
Neither have I.

01:17:36.193 --> 01:17:38.527
And I didn't join the Army
to lose my dignity.

01:17:38.528 --> 01:17:40.112
That is the devil's brew.

01:17:40.113 --> 01:17:41.364
Looks like tonight...

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:43.324
- Yes!
- ...we're all gonna get some of that brew.

01:17:43.325 --> 01:17:44.451
Come on, it'll be fun!

01:17:56.838 --> 01:17:59.131
- I'mma get you a drink.
- I don't know if I should.

01:17:59.132 --> 01:18:02.678
Oh come on, you need to relax.
You can't sit in your office all day.

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:08.057
- There's some soldiers over there.
- Yeah, but I outrank them all.

01:18:08.058 --> 01:18:10.268
Not all of them.
You're looking the wrong way.

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:14.981
Come on. He's a lieutenant colonel.

01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:19.069
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:21.697
Hi.

01:18:23.198 --> 01:18:25.075
You don't seem surprised to see me.

01:18:27.327 --> 01:18:28.161
Not really.

01:18:29.996 --> 01:18:35.167
Well, when I heard about tonight,
I had to come keep an eye on my best girl.

01:18:35.168 --> 01:18:38.171
Mm. Wouldn't that be your wife at home?

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:41.299
I didn't do it.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:43.844
You didn't do what?

01:18:44.469 --> 01:18:45.803
I didn't marry her.

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:46.722
Why not?

01:18:48.181 --> 01:18:49.266
Because I met you.

01:18:51.518 --> 01:18:52.977
I'm not falling for this.

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:56.523
Why do you think I'm trying to get you
to fall for something?

01:19:00.610 --> 01:19:02.028
Can I have this dance?

01:19:35.812 --> 01:19:36.855
I love this song.

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:43.444
<i>♪ You made me love you ♪</i>

01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.863
<i>♪ I didn't wanna do it ♪</i>

01:19:45.864 --> 01:19:47.198
<i>♪ I didn't wanna do it... ♪</i>

01:19:47.199 --> 01:19:48.449
You have the worst voice.

01:19:48.450 --> 01:19:49.366
<i>♪ You made me... ♪</i>

01:19:49.367 --> 01:19:50.368
♪ ...<i>want-- ♪</i>

01:20:16.311 --> 01:20:17.771
Was it something I said?

01:20:19.314 --> 01:20:20.524
No, I, uh...

01:20:22.150 --> 01:20:23.401
I just, um...

01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:30.408
All right, you tell me something
that's going on with you,

01:20:31.284 --> 01:20:33.620
and I'll tell you something
that's going on with me.

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.626
Well, the things I've seen
since I've been here

01:20:40.585 --> 01:20:42.128
have shook me something awful.

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:44.840
You've been to the front lines?

01:20:45.841 --> 01:20:47.092
To deliver supplies.

01:20:49.761 --> 01:20:51.179
How bad is it?

01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:56.601
You can't imagine.

01:20:59.729 --> 01:21:01.523
But seeing you here tonight...

01:21:04.067 --> 01:21:05.819
you're a sight for sore eyes.

01:21:07.112 --> 01:21:08.572
I know I don't know you...

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:11.950
but I'd like to get to know you.

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:15.120
I'd like you to get to know me.

01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:18.248
I'm sorry.

01:21:20.792 --> 01:21:23.587
And as much as
I'd like to get to know you, I...

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:31.761
I'm still so scattered in my head
and my heart about somebody that I lost.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:34.723
So...

01:21:37.601 --> 01:21:40.228
I don't think
I have anything to give to you.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.946
Um...

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:52.324
You can give me friendship.

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:55.327
That I can do.

01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:00.123
We sure need that over here.

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:05.545
I'm sorry you're so sad.

01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:11.426
And I'm sorry for your loss.

01:22:16.932 --> 01:22:18.391
Now, ain't you cold out here?

01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:20.644
Yeah, it's cold.

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:22.187
Come on.

01:22:30.612 --> 01:22:31.655
Excuse me?

01:22:32.238 --> 01:22:33.822
- Yes?
- I'm Clemens.

01:22:33.823 --> 01:22:36.158
- I'm here to be your chaplain.
- My what?

01:22:36.159 --> 01:22:39.245
Chaplain. I was sent to help you.

01:22:47.587 --> 01:22:49.089
A-ten-hut!

01:22:52.133 --> 01:22:53.258
Adams!

01:22:53.259 --> 01:22:55.220
Sir, yes, sir. Is there a problem?

01:22:55.887 --> 01:22:58.806
One of your girls here
has the initials JMB.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:02.226
And that JMB returned
a very important letter to sender

01:23:02.227 --> 01:23:04.103
that I am just now receiving.

01:23:04.104 --> 01:23:06.730
The name of the recipient
on that envelope is illegible.

01:23:06.731 --> 01:23:09.901
I can see my Army number
as clear as day. Can you?

01:23:12.445 --> 01:23:14.572
Or maybe you can't read numbers.

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:16.741
It's a damn shame.

01:23:18.284 --> 01:23:21.996
I'm only gonna ask you
one more time. Who is JMB?

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:23.665
That would be me, sir.

01:23:28.753 --> 01:23:29.587
You?

01:23:32.424 --> 01:23:34.843
Damn, girl. Are you stupid?

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:38.971
No, sir, I am not.

01:23:38.972 --> 01:23:42.017
Then why would you send this letter back
after so much time?

01:23:43.059 --> 01:23:44.435
You must be stupid.

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:46.730
All of you must be stupid!

01:23:48.898 --> 01:23:51.943
You can't send a little letter
to who it belongs to?

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:55.863
- Can you read or write?
- Yes, sir, we can.

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.197
I'm talking to this gal.

01:23:57.198 --> 01:23:59.408
I know, but as her commanding officer,
it is my res--

01:23:59.409 --> 01:24:00.952
Shut up, Adams!

01:24:03.121 --> 01:24:05.248
Can you hear me? Answer the question!

01:24:07.333 --> 01:24:08.710
Yes, sir!

01:24:09.919 --> 01:24:11.921
I can hear you.

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:20.721
You've been here for two months,
and nothing's done.

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:23.766
What the hell kind of operation
are you running here?

01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:25.434
I'm going straight to General Halt

01:24:25.435 --> 01:24:28.353
and telling him to shut
this clown show down right now.

01:24:28.354 --> 01:24:32.400
This is ridiculous. What a waste of time.
Where do they find these people?

01:24:38.364 --> 01:24:39.365
At ease.

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:42.744
Back to work, ladies.

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:44.829
Wait, wait, wait!

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.960
Ladies, I don't care what anybody says.

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:53.796
You have been doing a fine job,

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:56.633
even in these circumstances.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:01.387
But a lot of the mail is being returned,

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.723
and that is disappointing.

01:25:04.891 --> 01:25:06.391
I've been watching the process.

01:25:06.392 --> 01:25:09.603
I have a pretty high-level understanding
of what's going on,

01:25:09.604 --> 01:25:12.398
but I need you to tell me
from your point of view.

01:25:16.194 --> 01:25:18.195
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:25:18.196 --> 01:25:19.614
One at a time.

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:22.033
You first.

01:25:23.118 --> 01:25:26.537
Ma'am, at last count,
we have over 7,500 Robert Smiths.

01:25:26.538 --> 01:25:28.080
There are so many locator cards

01:25:28.081 --> 01:25:30.249
that we have to try and find
the last one by date.

01:25:30.250 --> 01:25:32.251
And sometimes, it's illegible.

01:25:32.252 --> 01:25:33.961
Not to mention it's so cold,

01:25:33.962 --> 01:25:36.338
and some of us
have to work with these gloves on.

01:25:36.339 --> 01:25:40.217
A lot of these care packages are molded.
Even the rats are biting through them.

01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:42.720
They've even eaten
through the names on the envelopes.

01:25:43.304 --> 01:25:45.597
Sometimes, it's just one or two words.

01:25:45.598 --> 01:25:48.767
It's like some kind
of crazy crossword puzzle.

01:25:48.768 --> 01:25:51.396
Now, Vera, you love a crossword puzzle.

01:25:52.063 --> 01:25:54.773
- Yes, ma'am.
- Think you could take a look at those?

01:25:54.774 --> 01:25:57.151
- See if maybe you can help out with that?
- I will.

01:25:57.152 --> 01:26:00.946
Dolores, you were at the movie theater
every weekend watching the newsreel.

01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:04.366
If we can make out where it originated,
can you tell us what's going on there?

01:26:04.367 --> 01:26:06.243
Yes. And if I can see when it was sent,

01:26:06.244 --> 01:26:08.912
I might be able to tell you
where a unit was headed.

01:26:08.913 --> 01:26:10.622
Well, that might help.

01:26:10.623 --> 01:26:12.916
Some of these letters
are to Joe-Joe or Bubba.

01:26:12.917 --> 01:26:15.627
Well, in those cases,
just open the envelopes.

01:26:15.628 --> 01:26:18.213
See if there's any clues
that can tell you who they are.

01:26:18.214 --> 01:26:21.300
Well, with some of the packages,
like clothes and things?

01:26:21.301 --> 01:26:23.511
I worked at the Garment District
in California.

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:26.972
I know fabrics well. I can help with that.

01:26:26.973 --> 01:26:30.058
Ma'am? I was a postmaster
in North Carolina.

01:26:30.059 --> 01:26:32.936
I was a mortician
at my daddy's funeral home.

01:26:32.937 --> 01:26:35.063
Girl, how's that supposed to help us?

01:26:35.064 --> 01:26:37.065
You notice I didn't say my best skill.

01:26:37.066 --> 01:26:38.067
Johnnie Mae.

01:27:00.006 --> 01:27:04.719
I know this is a solemn time,
as we have lost a great man.

01:27:05.511 --> 01:27:09.182
President Roosevelt
was a man that led us well,

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:12.310
and leadership is important.

01:27:12.810 --> 01:27:14.811
It is my prayer that President Truman

01:27:14.812 --> 01:27:18.023
will always show
that same great leadership.

01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:19.734
But in order to lead,

01:27:20.944 --> 01:27:22.528
you have to be qualified.

01:27:25.949 --> 01:27:29.117
In Proverbs 4:14, it reads,

01:27:29.118 --> 01:27:31.454
"Enter not into the path of the wicked

01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:35.333
and go not the way of evil men."

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:39.379
Well, that word can also be exchanged

01:27:40.296 --> 01:27:42.006
for evil women.

01:27:43.091 --> 01:27:46.344
As I pray for many of you,
I know it's hard.

01:27:47.387 --> 01:27:51.181
You are not up to being here,
and you are being led by someone

01:27:51.182 --> 01:27:53.977
who is not capable
in the eyes of the Army,

01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:58.438
nor is she qualified morally
in the eyes of the Lord.

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:01.275
It is a shame that on Friday night,

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:04.237
every bulb in this place
is shining brightly,

01:28:04.737 --> 01:28:09.158
but on Sunday morning,
there is a burnt-out bulb above my head.

01:28:09.742 --> 01:28:11.786
That is not the Lord's work.

01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:16.666
You have to be careful
when you are being led by evil.

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:21.004
It will cause you to miss
important things.

01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:25.800
Let us pray.

01:28:38.021 --> 01:28:39.062
So he says,

01:28:39.063 --> 01:28:42.774
"I know such an assignment is probably not
what you had in mind, but I guaran--"

01:28:42.775 --> 01:28:44.110
Those are my things.

01:28:45.194 --> 01:28:47.029
"Dear General Halt,

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:50.282
the women of the Six Triple Eight
are horribly wicked."

01:28:50.283 --> 01:28:53.618
"They are led by an evil woman
who promotes debauchery,

01:28:53.619 --> 01:28:56.955
as she is running
the King Edward School like a brothel."

01:28:56.956 --> 01:29:00.084
- I said those are my things.
- Yes, as are those, by your feet.

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:02.669
You will be leaving here today.

01:29:02.670 --> 01:29:04.838
I was sent here by General Halt.

01:29:04.839 --> 01:29:07.007
I don't care
if the good Lord himself sent you.

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:09.426
Now, I don't know if you know this,

01:29:09.427 --> 01:29:12.137
but I am the daughter of a preacher.

01:29:12.138 --> 01:29:15.182
I know the Bible from Genesis
to Revelations and backwards.

01:29:15.183 --> 01:29:19.395
I am a woman of faith
and tremendous character,

01:29:19.979 --> 01:29:23.107
and I lead these women with a stern hand

01:29:23.691 --> 01:29:27.444
and the love and understanding
that I would think a chaplain should.

01:29:27.445 --> 01:29:30.906
Now, I have had to endure
the hissing and backstabbing

01:29:30.907 --> 01:29:32.449
of white men in the military.

01:29:32.450 --> 01:29:35.786
I have learned every law in this Army

01:29:35.787 --> 01:29:38.955
to defend myself
and to get to where I am now,

01:29:38.956 --> 01:29:40.874
so if you think I am afraid of you

01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:43.919
or whatever you can write
in a letter to anyone,

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:47.882
then you are as wrong as you were
in that so-called sermon today.

01:29:49.592 --> 01:29:52.094
This soldier here will take you
wherever you want to go,

01:29:52.095 --> 01:29:54.430
but you will be on your way right now.

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:58.601
Can she help you with your bags?

01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:14.867
Why would they send a chaplain?

01:30:16.411 --> 01:30:20.163
Well... on the night
that we're hosting the soldiers,

01:30:20.164 --> 01:30:21.707
you know what that is.

01:30:22.959 --> 01:30:24.544
- I think--
- Shh.

01:30:26.379 --> 01:30:27.380
That's a V-1.

01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:45.690
Come on now!

01:30:54.490 --> 01:30:55.950
Careful, careful! Go, go, go!

01:31:09.672 --> 01:31:10.715
Get down.

01:31:58.554 --> 01:31:59.554
Major Adams?

01:31:59.555 --> 01:32:00.890
What is it, Private?

01:32:02.517 --> 01:32:04.727
Are those the coordinates
where the soldiers are?

01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:09.690
Yes. But understand you're not
supposed to be looking this close.

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:12.651
That's why they are all redacting them.

01:32:12.652 --> 01:32:14.820
We can't have this get into enemy hands.

01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:22.745
A symbol...

01:32:24.622 --> 01:32:25.915
is drawn on it.

01:32:29.627 --> 01:32:32.922
And... this letter's from a few weeks ago.

01:32:34.924 --> 01:32:36.175
And in this letter...

01:32:37.885 --> 01:32:40.388
it mentions, uh, the Indian head.

01:32:42.306 --> 01:32:44.225
These hand-drawn clues

01:32:45.017 --> 01:32:48.895
are how the soldiers are secretly
letting their families know

01:32:48.896 --> 01:32:50.730
what part of the world they in.

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:56.361
Private, each one of the divisions
of our soldiers has 16,000 men in it.

01:32:56.362 --> 01:33:00.700
You just located 48,000 of them.

01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:07.581
Ladies, how many of you have seen
hand-drawn symbols on the letters

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:10.500
that resemble the division patches
of our soldiers?

01:33:10.501 --> 01:33:11.836
Hold up your hands.

01:33:19.885 --> 01:33:21.929
That's very good work, Private.

01:33:26.142 --> 01:33:26.976
Mm-hm.

01:33:44.201 --> 01:33:46.703
Johnnie Mae is gonna have a fit
when we get all this mail.

01:33:46.704 --> 01:33:48.539
She needs to settle down.

01:33:52.418 --> 01:33:54.170
We don't have time for this!

01:33:55.004 --> 01:33:57.172
- Vera, we have to stay on the route.
- Whoa!

01:33:57.173 --> 01:33:58.757
- And be here all day?
- No!

01:33:58.758 --> 01:34:02.011
We got some good momentum going.
I'm not gonna be the one to break it.

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:06.723
Stop! No, stop!

01:34:06.724 --> 01:34:07.725
What?

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:12.021
I... I think we are over a UXB.

01:34:13.230 --> 01:34:14.065
You sure?

01:34:15.858 --> 01:34:17.777
Oh my God.

01:34:23.115 --> 01:34:24.784
What do we... What do we do?

01:34:27.453 --> 01:34:29.538
What Major Adams trained us to do.

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:34.418
We need to evacuate the truck,
but we stick to our training.

01:34:36.462 --> 01:34:37.296
Okay.

01:34:38.297 --> 01:34:41.217
Y'all slowly get off the truck.

01:34:42.551 --> 01:34:44.303
Slowly!

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:52.060
One.

01:34:52.061 --> 01:34:53.145
- Two.
- Two.

01:34:54.939 --> 01:34:55.898
- Three!
- Three!

01:35:10.621 --> 01:35:11.747
Oh my Lord.

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:13.207
What is it?

01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:14.792
Look.

01:35:22.591 --> 01:35:23.467
Lena.

01:35:25.094 --> 01:35:26.846
Y'all better look like you're working.

01:35:28.097 --> 01:35:30.099
Oh, you gonna wanna see this.

01:35:51.495 --> 01:35:54.248
- Are you going to read it?
- Would you give her a second?

01:35:56.542 --> 01:35:57.917
Ladies.

01:35:57.918 --> 01:36:00.129
Major Adams wants to see us.

01:36:01.005 --> 01:36:02.506
There's been an accident.

01:36:22.777 --> 01:36:25.154
So the Army is not even gonna bury them?

01:36:26.489 --> 01:36:28.115
I was told no.

01:36:30.075 --> 01:36:32.036
I'm so sorry, ladies.

01:36:32.536 --> 01:36:36.372
Now, I will get word back
to the United States to ask for help,

01:36:36.373 --> 01:36:38.833
but in the meantime,
we are taking up this collection

01:36:38.834 --> 01:36:41.419
because we will not allow our soldiers

01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:45.424
to be denied the dignity
of a proper burial.

Yes, ma'am.

01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:08.757
There are
many American soldiers buried here.

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:12.511
If you know the day he died
and the unit he was in,

01:38:13.012 --> 01:38:14.346
you can find him here.

01:38:22.271 --> 01:38:24.273
Can he bring you back to base?

01:38:26.609 --> 01:38:27.443
Yes, ma'am.

01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.989
Go on then.

01:38:45.002 --> 01:38:46.003
Hey.

01:38:49.673 --> 01:38:50.883
Can you wait for me?

01:38:52.843 --> 01:38:53.677
Sure.

01:39:53.904 --> 01:39:56.532
I knew I'd find you. I knew it.

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:30.607
<i>Dear Miss Lena,</i>

01:40:32.067 --> 01:40:34.695
<i>vector niner, niner here.</i>

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:39.116
<i>I don't wanna cause you concern,</i>

01:40:40.075 --> 01:40:43.411
<i>but for the first time, I think
that the reality of me not making it home</i>

01:40:43.412 --> 01:40:44.663
<i>may be sinking in.</i>

01:40:46.832 --> 01:40:48.667
<i>I know I asked you to wait for me,</i>

01:40:49.877 --> 01:40:52.796
<i>and knowing you, you will.</i>

01:40:54.965 --> 01:40:55.799
<i>But...</i>

01:40:57.634 --> 01:40:59.094
<i>if I don't make it back,</i>

01:41:00.387 --> 01:41:03.682
<i>please live your life with the laughter
that you had in that rumble seat,</i>

01:41:05.100 --> 01:41:07.061
<i>that kind of freedom and fun.</i>

01:41:10.105 --> 01:41:12.608
<i>Promise me
you will live a long life.</i>

01:41:13.484 --> 01:41:15.319
<i>Long enough for the both of us.</i>

01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:19.865
<i>Promise me you will laugh enough
for the both of us.</i>

01:41:22.451 --> 01:41:24.243
<i>I truly love you, Lena Derriecott.</i>

01:41:24.244 --> 01:41:26.496
I love you too, Abram David.

01:41:26.497 --> 01:41:27.498
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:41:29.124 --> 01:41:32.461
<i>I'm sorry I never had the courage
to say it sooner than that night.</i>

01:41:35.089 --> 01:41:36.590
<i>Look for me in the skies.</i>

01:41:38.759 --> 01:41:39.676
<i>Yours forever...</i>

01:41:41.512 --> 01:41:42.346
<i>Abram.</i>

01:43:11.059 --> 01:43:12.018
At ease.

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:12.978
Morning, sir.

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:17.941
General Lee tells me
that you're making progress.

01:43:18.525 --> 01:43:19.359
Yes, sir.

01:43:20.110 --> 01:43:22.278
Even though we just lost
two of our soldiers.

01:43:22.279 --> 01:43:24.198
Well, yeah. Well, that happens.

01:43:25.115 --> 01:43:28.035
As for the progress
of the mail, I disagree.

01:43:29.494 --> 01:43:32.915
Not one of my troops
has seen a bit of your progress.

01:43:33.874 --> 01:43:38.085
Well, I'm sorry, sir.
We are working as fast as we can.

01:43:38.086 --> 01:43:39.713
Clearly not fast enough.

01:43:46.595 --> 01:43:48.888
This cannot be your entire battalion.

01:43:48.889 --> 01:43:50.056
No, sir.

01:43:50.057 --> 01:43:53.726
We work 24-hour shifts,
so some of our women are resting.

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:55.187
- They're resting?
- Yes, sir.

01:43:55.687 --> 01:43:59.024
I'm here to inspect your troops,
and your troop's not here.

01:43:59.524 --> 01:44:00.983
That make sense, Major?

01:44:00.984 --> 01:44:01.985
Well, sir, I--

01:44:26.468 --> 01:44:27.511
A beauty parlor?

01:44:29.763 --> 01:44:30.597
Yes, sir.

01:44:32.849 --> 01:44:35.227
This is no way to spend the Army's money.

01:44:42.526 --> 01:44:44.319
So you are telling me

01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:47.572
that they got time to get their hair done,

01:44:48.949 --> 01:44:53.537
but they do not have time
to be inspected by their general?

01:44:56.581 --> 01:44:58.000
Oh, no, sir, I'm-- I--

01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:02.253
I'm so sorry, but in there
we have our night-shift women,

01:45:02.254 --> 01:45:03.964
and they are asleep.

01:45:10.178 --> 01:45:14.266
Now, sir, those are our showers,
and my ladies are showering.

01:45:16.143 --> 01:45:17.644
- Lee.
- Yes, sir?

01:45:18.312 --> 01:45:21.981
Did you not tell this woman
that I was coming for an inspection?

01:45:21.982 --> 01:45:22.899
Yes, sir.

01:45:23.900 --> 01:45:26.945
And does the major
not understand that inspection

01:45:27.446 --> 01:45:29.405
is whatever I wanna inspect?

01:45:29.406 --> 01:45:31.366
Yes, sir. She does.

01:45:34.119 --> 01:45:35.537
This how you run a company?

01:45:40.959 --> 01:45:42.085
What about that room?

01:45:42.836 --> 01:45:44.212
May I go in that room?

01:45:45.255 --> 01:45:47.256
Yes, sir. That is our delivery room.

01:45:47.257 --> 01:45:48.508
Well, thank you.

01:45:49.509 --> 01:45:50.427
Of course, sir.

01:45:59.353 --> 01:46:01.271
Attention!

01:46:23.418 --> 01:46:24.669
What's this mess?

01:46:25.212 --> 01:46:28.381
Well, sir, some of the packages
were chewed in half by vermin,

01:46:28.382 --> 01:46:29.715
and the contents separated.

01:46:29.716 --> 01:46:31.884
Our soldiers have come up
with a way to figure out

01:46:31.885 --> 01:46:34.471
which item belongs to which by the fabric.

01:46:53.490 --> 01:46:57.410
Now, this here is where
we are able to match the letters

01:46:57.411 --> 01:47:00.330
with the soldiers
that have the same first and last name.

01:47:01.206 --> 01:47:03.791
Now, wouldn't it be simpler
just to use their number?

01:47:03.792 --> 01:47:06.085
Well, yes, sir,
that is what we tried at first.

01:47:06.086 --> 01:47:08.879
Some of them are addressed
to nicknames, so we had to do research

01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:12.008
to make sure that they end up
with the right soldier.

01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:19.306
Wasting more of the Army's money
on perfume?

01:47:19.307 --> 01:47:20.474
No, sir.

01:47:20.475 --> 01:47:24.603
When we couldn't make out the names,
because some of them were smudged, um...

01:47:24.604 --> 01:47:27.648
Some women writing letters
spray them with their favorite perfume,

01:47:27.649 --> 01:47:31.152
and, well, some of our soldiers
were able to recognize those perfumes.

01:47:31.153 --> 01:47:32.069
It was a chore,

01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:35.322
but we were able to match the sender
with the state where that perfume was sold

01:47:35.323 --> 01:47:36.616
and then trace it back.

01:47:42.789 --> 01:47:43.874
Step aside, gal.

01:47:49.796 --> 01:47:52.673
Are you opening and reading this mail?

01:47:52.674 --> 01:47:56.011
Sir, only in the case
where we cannot locate the soldier, sir.

01:47:57.012 --> 01:47:57.971
Are you kidding me?

01:47:59.890 --> 01:48:03.726
Y'all opening and reading
the letters of these white soldiers?

01:48:03.727 --> 01:48:06.270
Sir, sometimes,
that is the only way to get the clues

01:48:06.271 --> 01:48:07.814
to find out where they might be.

01:48:08.899 --> 01:48:10.358
This is private, Major.

01:48:11.985 --> 01:48:14.654
Have you lost
what's little left of your mind?

01:48:17.199 --> 01:48:18.700
Tried to go over my head,

01:48:19.493 --> 01:48:21.660
get soldiers buried that you had killed.

01:48:21.661 --> 01:48:24.539
You got them killed
'cause you did not train them well.

01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:27.334
So now,

01:48:28.919 --> 01:48:30.962
President Roosevelt has died,

01:48:32.339 --> 01:48:35.467
this little experiment
gonna be shut down immediately.

01:48:37.761 --> 01:48:41.348
I think I'm gonna
have you relieved of your duties.

01:48:43.433 --> 01:48:46.060
And I'm gonna bring
a white lieutenant in here

01:48:46.061 --> 01:48:47.812
to show you how to run this unit!

01:48:50.857 --> 01:48:52.484
Over my dead body, sir.

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:05.163
What did you say?

01:49:07.415 --> 01:49:10.377
Sir, with all due respect,

01:49:10.961 --> 01:49:14.756
my battalion is working day and night
in horrible conditions.

01:49:15.465 --> 01:49:17.551
We have no heat most of the time.

01:49:18.677 --> 01:49:23.055
Gets so cold that the women have to put
the water in helmets to wash themselves.

01:49:23.056 --> 01:49:27.269
You gave us this place to turn into
a barracks with no bed and no help.

01:49:27.811 --> 01:49:30.688
And my women are harassed,
and then they are befriended

01:49:30.689 --> 01:49:34.316
only to be asked if they have
tails under their skirts after midnight

01:49:34.317 --> 01:49:36.777
because of the rumors of white soldiers.

01:49:36.778 --> 01:49:40.823
You sent a chaplain, not to pray,
but to spy on us.

01:49:40.824 --> 01:49:44.910
We just lost two soldiers to a UXB
who were highly trained,

01:49:44.911 --> 01:49:46.787
and I know because I trained them.

01:49:46.788 --> 01:49:51.041
And you wouldn't even give the orders
for them to have a proper burial.

01:49:51.042 --> 01:49:55.337
Now, I know we are fighting a war,
but our war starts with being Negro.

01:49:55.338 --> 01:49:58.048
We are fighting on every front.

01:49:58.049 --> 01:50:03.430
So as I said, sir, over my dead body, sir.

01:50:45.305 --> 01:50:47.098
He's gonna court-martial me.

01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:52.770
I... I... I feel like such a hypocrite

01:50:52.771 --> 01:50:56.941
telling these women to maintain
their dignity and decorum.

01:50:59.027 --> 01:51:00.986
I don't know what came over me.

01:51:00.987 --> 01:51:02.989
You was thinking you were right.

01:51:03.490 --> 01:51:06.242
He was rude,
acting like we haven't done a thing.

01:51:06.743 --> 01:51:10.246
But he is my superior officer.
I know better than that.

01:51:11.122 --> 01:51:13.582
Ma'am. I'm sorry, but we have a problem.

01:51:13.583 --> 01:51:15.501
The women have stopped working.

01:51:15.502 --> 01:51:16.544
Why?

01:51:17.212 --> 01:51:18.088
I don't know.

01:51:22.634 --> 01:51:24.386
Back to work, ladies!

01:51:27.097 --> 01:51:28.598
Get to work!

01:51:54.457 --> 01:51:56.459
Get to work!

01:52:29.492 --> 01:52:32.995
I know that Roosevelt
was a sympathizer and all,

01:52:32.996 --> 01:52:36.166
but I need you to talk to Truman.
I mean, nothing's been done.

01:52:37.959 --> 01:52:41.796
You will tell the president
that this is the worst mistake.

01:52:45.091 --> 01:52:48.761
And that Adams gal? Yeah.

01:52:48.762 --> 01:52:50.472
I want her court-martialed.

01:52:52.098 --> 01:52:55.351
Oh, she said it, Marshal.
She said it to my face!

01:52:57.312 --> 01:52:59.856
And them reading the white soldiers' mail...

01:53:03.902 --> 01:53:07.070
Just a second. What's going on out there?

01:53:07.071 --> 01:53:09.407
The men are receiving their mail, sir.

01:53:17.207 --> 01:53:19.041
- Morgan!
- Yeah! Yes, sir!

01:53:19.042 --> 01:53:20.293

Mail for Troutman!

01:54:04.128 --> 01:54:05.630
- Troutman!
- Yeah!

01:54:20.019 --> 01:54:20.895
Here you go.

01:56:07.210 --> 01:56:09.003
