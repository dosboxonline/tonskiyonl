WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:04.123
Put a bounty on his head.

00:04.124 --> 00:05.416
And those pups.

00:06.708 --> 00:08.956
Is the Supervisor going
to contact the Republic for help?

00:08.957 --> 00:12.081
The Supervisor is unable
to risk any contact.

00:12.082 --> 00:13.748
Damn the risk, these are our kids!

00:13.749 --> 00:17.583
I'm submitting a petition for
an immediate audience with the Supervisor.

00:19.291 --> 00:20.541
<i>So...</i>

00:21.125 --> 00:22.583
<i>This is At Attin?</i>

00:23.416 --> 00:24.789
It tastes like ashy dust.

00:24.790 --> 00:28.039
<i>So maybe this is another planet,
co-founded with At Attin.</i>

00:28.040 --> 00:30.831
And anyone that lives here
might know about home.

00:30.832 --> 00:31.914
Don't run off.

00:31.915 --> 00:34.289
33, keep Jod on the ship
until we get back.

00:34.290 --> 00:36.664
Initiating babysitting sequence.

00:36.665 --> 00:38.125
Come on, baby.

00:38.625 --> 00:40.081
<i>I can take you somewhere safe.</i>

00:40.082 --> 00:42.039
<i>Follow me. Quick and quiet.</i>

00:42.040 --> 00:45.456
You don't have any ancient maps,
or any star charts or--

00:45.457 --> 00:47.581
What about the knowledge hidden
in the Fallen Sanctum?

00:47.582 --> 00:49.664
Hayna. It is a distant place.

00:49.665 --> 00:51.666
<i>You would not survive the journey.</i>

00:54.833 --> 00:55.914
Jod, you actually--

00:55.915 --> 00:57.083
We're saved!

00:58.208 --> 01:00.914
Come.
I will take you to the Fallen Sanctum.

01:00.915 --> 01:02.831
<i>There are old carvings.</i>

01:02.832 --> 01:04.581
<i>Coordinates for other planets.</i>

01:04.582 --> 01:06.041
I found At Attin!

01:06.875 --> 01:08.916
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, they're gone.

01:09.791 --> 01:10.998
Now we're stuck.

01:10.999 --> 01:12.706
You'll figure something out.

01:12.707 --> 01:14.623
<i>'Cause you're amazing, Fern.</i>

01:14.624 --> 01:17.123
33, run memory override.

01:17.124 --> 01:19.706
You remember everything about At Attin.

01:19.707 --> 01:21.706
Ah, yes.

01:21.707 --> 01:25.789
The captain told me
if anyone ever comes pokin' around,

01:25.790 --> 01:27.289
to pull them apart.

01:27.290 --> 01:30.208
- 33!
- Limb from limb!

02:37.500 --> 02:39.123
What are you doing here?

02:39.124 --> 02:40.414
Did something go wrong?

02:40.415 --> 02:43.623
Yes.
We need a Barrier access code.

02:43.624 --> 02:45.956
But you're going to have to steal it.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.041
What?

02:48.208 --> 02:49.375
I don't have clearance.

02:50.250 --> 02:52.956
You can use this to break into the system.

02:52.957 --> 02:56.375
But don't let anyone see it.

02:58.416 --> 03:00.375
We need that access code.

03:37.291 --> 03:38.873
Can I help you?

03:38.874 --> 03:41.789
Sir, an energy surge was detected
at your terminal.

03:41.790 --> 03:44.248
I don't remember any surges.

03:44.249 --> 03:47.750
Nevertheless, please step out
so I can access the terminal.

03:55.125 --> 03:57.331
Sir, what are you hiding behind your back?

03:57.332 --> 04:00.166
- Nothing.
- Then show me your hands.

04:01.708 --> 04:03.166
And your other hand.

04:09.291 --> 04:15.040
Sir, please show me both of your hands
at the same time.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.206
A Coordinator
was caught with this.

04:19.207 --> 04:21.873
Shall I initiate security protocols?

04:21.874 --> 04:25.040
Delete all records of this incident
and power yourself down.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.581
I told you to wait.

04:39.582 --> 04:42.289
It's just a way to get a message
through the Barrier.

04:42.290 --> 04:44.581
We can help the kids
without saying anything specific

04:44.582 --> 04:45.664
about At Attin's location.

04:45.665 --> 04:47.789
I'm handling this
through the proper channels,

04:47.790 --> 04:50.081
which is the only way
we're ever going to see our kids again.

04:50.082 --> 04:51.375
And is that working?

04:56.291 --> 04:57.581
Something's wrong.

04:57.582 --> 05:01.333
The Supervisor isn't gonna help us.

05:02.208 --> 05:03.625
We have to do something.

05:06.666 --> 05:08.166
Fara, please.

05:12.750 --> 05:14.250
What's the plan?

05:35.458 --> 05:37.248
Guys, what's even the point?

05:37.249 --> 05:39.664
If we turn him on,
he'll just try to kill us again.

05:39.665 --> 05:42.623
The point is,
he knows how to find At Attin.

05:42.624 --> 05:46.373
And I rerouted the memory chip
so it won't overload his core processor.

05:46.374 --> 05:50.373
Are you sure? 'Cause he was about
to tear us apart, limb from limb.

05:50.374 --> 05:52.125
It'll be all right. Just turn it on.

05:52.708 --> 05:53.833
You turn him on.

05:54.625 --> 05:56.706
You just wanna ask him about the treasure.

05:56.707 --> 05:58.414
And you just want him to take you home.

05:58.415 --> 06:00.000
You're just scared.

06:01.666 --> 06:02.791
You're scared.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.083
KB, switch him on.

06:19.041 --> 06:20.916
What do ya want?

06:22.000 --> 06:24.456
Do you remember where At Attin is?

06:24.457 --> 06:26.998
Make him promise
he's not gonna attack us again.

06:26.999 --> 06:28.664
I will not harm you.

06:28.665 --> 06:30.914
Those were
the old captain's orders.

06:30.915 --> 06:32.081
Old Captain Rennod.

06:32.082 --> 06:34.414
- But what about At--
- Wait, what? Captain Rennod? Tak Rennod?

06:34.415 --> 06:36.416
Aye. The very same.

06:40.416 --> 06:42.541
This ship is the <i>Onyx Cinder.</i>

06:46.541 --> 06:49.125
You don't appreciate
how incredible this is.

06:49.708 --> 06:52.958
Tak Rennod's the most infamous pirate
the galaxy's ever known.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.291
For years, he roamed the skies,

06:58.000 --> 07:02.291
plundering,
terrorizing whole star systems.

07:04.708 --> 07:06.083
Anything he wanted...

07:07.333 --> 07:08.416
he took it.

07:12.416 --> 07:16.206
The story goes,
he was after the treasure of At Attin

07:16.207 --> 07:18.833
aboard the mysterious ship the <i>Onyx Cinder</i>

07:20.458 --> 07:21.458
when he just...

07:26.875 --> 07:27.875
disappeared.

07:29.666 --> 07:30.708
Crew,

07:31.833 --> 07:32.916
ship,

07:34.583 --> 07:35.583
all.

07:37.166 --> 07:38.539
Yeah, who cares?

07:38.540 --> 07:41.831
33, do you remember
where At Attin is or not?

07:41.832 --> 07:46.581
Sadly, no. But Captain Rennod
scanned At Attin's coordinates.

07:46.582 --> 07:50.831
Kept 'em hid in his lair,
deep beneath Skull Ridge Mountain.

07:50.832 --> 07:52.456
Perfect.

07:52.457 --> 07:54.875
- Then take us there.
- Aye, aye, captain.

08:05.458 --> 08:08.373
There we were, on course for At Attin...

08:08.374 --> 08:11.750
when Captain Rennod
began to suspect mutiny.

08:12.750 --> 08:16.331
With the treasure so close,
the first mate went mad with greed

08:16.332 --> 08:18.289
and challenged the Captain.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.789
Oh, no. What did Captain Rennod do?

08:20.790 --> 08:23.081
The Captain's concubine
betrayed him,

08:23.082 --> 08:25.373
stabbing him with his own dagger.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.081
But the Captain had the last laugh.

08:27.082 --> 08:28.998
He locked out the ship's controls,

08:28.999 --> 08:33.082
and the whole mutinous lot of 'em died
c-crashing into At Attin.

08:36.166 --> 08:37.291
What's a concubine?

08:39.541 --> 08:41.373
- That's enough story time for now.
- Aw.

08:41.374 --> 08:43.873
But I wanna hear
about Rennod's secret lair.

08:43.874 --> 08:46.373
Oh, how I've missed it. My home.

08:46.374 --> 08:48.664
The place of my assembly.

08:48.665 --> 08:50.956
The lair lies in the heart
of a lone mountain

08:50.957 --> 08:52.664
where bubbling pits of mud

08:52.665 --> 08:56.289
hide the mangled corpses
of the Captain's foes.

08:56.290 --> 08:57.791
Home sweet home.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.914
Ah, my circuits buzz to see it again.

09:02.915 --> 09:05.331
'Tis so good to have me memories back.

09:05.332 --> 09:08.206
Pillaging and ransacking.
Carousing.

09:08.207 --> 09:10.332
I remember
a time when Cap'n...

09:31.125 --> 09:32.125
What are you doing, boy?

09:35.125 --> 09:37.166
- Nothing.
- Oh.

09:41.708 --> 09:42.708
Oh, dear.

09:44.458 --> 09:48.000
All I ever wanted
was a real adventure.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.206
Well, you're going
to Tak Rennod's hidden lair.

09:52.207 --> 09:54.206
Uh... Sounds pretty good to me.

09:54.207 --> 09:57.708
It's not what I thought
it would be like out here.

09:58.375 --> 10:01.875
It's scary and confusing. I--

10:04.541 --> 10:06.166
I-- I miss my dad.

10:07.791 --> 10:09.081
And my mom.

10:09.082 --> 10:10.166
Chin up.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.083
You'll see 'em again soon.

10:15.375 --> 10:16.625
Not my mom.

10:22.916 --> 10:23.916
All right.

10:24.791 --> 10:25.916
Here's what you do.

10:27.416 --> 10:28.541
Forget 'em.

10:30.958 --> 10:35.041
Your fears, your anxieties, your parents.

10:36.583 --> 10:40.998
They're what you call "attachments,"
and they're the last thing you need.

10:40.999 --> 10:42.250
Forget 'em.

10:43.125 --> 10:44.206
That's what I did.

10:44.207 --> 10:45.625
I can't do that.

10:49.875 --> 10:52.125
You have a powerful imagination.

10:53.250 --> 10:55.956
When you want to,
you can see grand adventures

10:55.957 --> 10:58.166
even in a rotten galaxy like this.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.875
- Yeah.
- Remember.

11:03.541 --> 11:08.125
Your focus determines your reality.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.250
You have vision.

11:14.416 --> 11:15.416
Embrace it.

11:18.666 --> 11:22.375
Make your life the one you wanna live.

11:26.375 --> 11:31.083
Wait, but if you're not really a Jedi,
how'd you do that?

11:54.750 --> 11:57.164
Captain Rennod's lair is hidden
in these mountains...

11:57.165 --> 11:59.164
where none dare to go.

11:59.165 --> 12:00.541
Well, what about them?

12:04.041 --> 12:08.456
Ah, a cavalcade of fearsome,
bloodthirsty buccaneers, no doubt.

12:08.457 --> 12:11.039
Mm... They look like pleasure yachts.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.623
You took us to the wrong planet.

12:12.624 --> 12:14.206
- Again!
- Impossible.

12:14.207 --> 12:16.873
I recognize every twisted peak.

12:16.874 --> 12:19.666
Skull Ridge Mountain
should be directly ahead.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.081
<i>Welcome to Lanupa.</i>

12:25.082 --> 12:28.456
<i>A neutral planet where all are welcome
if they keep the peace.</i>

12:28.457 --> 12:30.248
<i>Violators will be shot down.</i>

12:30.249 --> 12:31.581
Oh, no! What's Lanupa?

12:31.582 --> 12:34.000
Lanupa?

12:35.458 --> 12:37.039
You brought us to Lanupa!

12:37.040 --> 12:39.581
It goes by many names.

12:39.582 --> 12:40.873
The Demon's Rest.

12:40.874 --> 12:42.623
Battle World.

12:42.624 --> 12:44.039
Lanupa.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.708
<i>Do you have a reservation?</i>

12:46.666 --> 12:48.831
- Uh, sure we do.
- I thought we--

12:48.832 --> 12:49.998
Wait, what are we doing here?

12:49.999 --> 12:51.414
- Wait, what's Lanupa?
- What's Lanupa?

12:51.415 --> 12:53.706
- Hey, shush. Shush.
- What's a pleasure yacht?

12:53.707 --> 12:55.873
<i>Sir, if those are children I hear,
be warned.</i>

12:55.874 --> 12:59.123
<i>Our facilities are intended
for adult guests only.</i>

12:59.124 --> 13:00.916
<i>Children are not permitted.</i>

13:01.666 --> 13:03.789
You heard what the man said.
You stay on the ship.

13:03.790 --> 13:06.914
33 and I will get into the lair,
we'll find the At Attin coordinates--

13:06.915 --> 13:08.456
And run off without us.

13:08.457 --> 13:10.081
Nice try. We're coming with you.

13:10.082 --> 13:12.125
You can trust me, you know.

13:12.708 --> 13:14.039
Stay on the ship.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.958
I go where the captain goes.

13:18.291 --> 13:19.291
Fine.

13:20.958 --> 13:22.706
Empty your pockets.

13:22.707 --> 13:25.958
I'm gonna need every last
Old Republic credit you're hiding.

13:52.500 --> 13:55.250
Contact waste removal.
We may have a situation.

13:56.625 --> 13:58.916
Waste removal, standby.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.625
May I present,

14:04.875 --> 14:06.875
from the Bratric system,

14:07.916 --> 14:10.125
the most Wise Elders...

14:14.458 --> 14:17.041
The most Wise El--

14:21.875 --> 14:24.414
Welcome, honored guests,

14:24.415 --> 14:28.039
to the famous Spas
at Skull Ridge Mountain.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.123
Right this way.

14:29.124 --> 14:30.498
Oh, allow me to translate.

14:30.499 --> 14:35.583
The Bratric physiology permits no Basic.

14:39.416 --> 14:43.583
This is Skull Ridge Mountain?

14:44.208 --> 14:45.750
They ruined it!

14:51.291 --> 14:53.081
What if the pirate lair's gone?

14:53.082 --> 14:55.500
It's here. We just gotta find it.

14:56.333 --> 14:58.416
- No weapons allowed in the Spa.
- Mm?

14:59.041 --> 15:00.708
Even a harmless little knife?

15:01.958 --> 15:02.958
Strict.

15:04.625 --> 15:08.125
Hmm.

15:09.291 --> 15:10.708
But fair.

15:11.791 --> 15:13.414
Now, what is the meaning of this?

15:13.415 --> 15:15.289
Droids have been used as weapons
in the past.

15:15.290 --> 15:17.123
This bolt restrains all violent action.

15:17.124 --> 15:19.625
Is that so?

15:31.833 --> 15:33.206
Luxury.

15:33.207 --> 15:35.291
That's our obsession here at the Spa.

15:36.083 --> 15:40.914
Luxury served by indulging
each guest's unique proclivities.

15:40.915 --> 15:42.456
You can't play a shanty on a harp.

15:42.457 --> 15:45.664
Over there is our Sensory Gymnasium.

15:45.665 --> 15:47.248
But where are the fighting pits?

15:47.249 --> 15:51.998
And, featuring delicacies
from across the sector, our buffet...

15:51.999 --> 15:53.414
Food for weaklings.

15:53.415 --> 15:56.498
And below us,
carved straight into the mountain rock

15:56.499 --> 16:00.081
by, legend has it,
ancient pirates, is the Spa.

16:00.082 --> 16:04.039
'Tis no legend, you insolent--

16:04.040 --> 16:08.125
Natural hot springs feed
our famous rejuvenating mud baths.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.914
The lair's definitely down there.

16:15.915 --> 16:17.000
I hope not.

16:17.875 --> 16:20.123
Uh, why so much security?

16:20.124 --> 16:23.414
The Banking Clan is here
for an economic summit

16:23.415 --> 16:26.081
and to enjoy the baths.

16:26.082 --> 16:31.083
So, we are on high alert
for spies and impostors.

16:33.916 --> 16:37.000
Now, what name is your reservation under?

16:48.083 --> 16:50.040
And the Wise Elders?

17:00.708 --> 17:01.789
Well.

17:01.790 --> 17:04.416
Oh, look. There I am.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.291
Um, Professor Gorelox.

17:08.625 --> 17:10.581
What?

17:10.582 --> 17:12.706
We're not staying.
We're finding the lair. That's it.

17:12.707 --> 17:14.125
You're right, ma'am.

17:15.208 --> 17:16.875
I should enjoy myself.

17:18.208 --> 17:22.456
Upgrade me to one of your finest suites.

17:22.457 --> 17:25.998
Oh, and, um,
ask the chef to select a banquet.

17:25.999 --> 17:27.206
I'll dine alone.

17:27.207 --> 17:30.206
Do my eyes deceive me,

17:30.207 --> 17:35.206
or is that Dash Zentin, in the flesh?

17:35.207 --> 17:38.206
Dash Zentin?
How many names does he have?

17:38.207 --> 17:40.873
What an unexpected delight...

17:40.874 --> 17:41.998
Pok...

17:41.999 --> 17:44.208
- It's Pokkit.
- Pokkit.

17:44.875 --> 17:46.248
How long has it been?

17:46.249 --> 17:49.499
Since you stole my bounty and left me
drowning in a pit of leeches?

17:51.291 --> 17:53.123
No hard feelings? Hmm?

17:53.124 --> 17:55.500
- None whatsoever.
- Good.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.750
In fact, I tried to find you.

17:58.333 --> 18:01.206
You know, just to make sure
you knew there was no bad blood.

18:01.207 --> 18:02.289
Yeah.

18:02.290 --> 18:07.833
Funny thing, though...
no one I met ever heard of a Dash Zentin.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.416
Ah...

18:11.500 --> 18:14.208
I bounty-hunt for a private client now.

18:15.125 --> 18:17.458
No more low-rent Guild jobs.

18:19.000 --> 18:20.206
Lucky you.

18:20.207 --> 18:21.375
So don't worry.

18:21.875 --> 18:23.623
I'm just here for some R & R.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.208
I haven't even checked the pucks.

18:25.958 --> 18:27.333
Why should I worry?

18:30.708 --> 18:31.916
I should go.

18:32.958 --> 18:34.833
Got a hot bacta soak.

18:35.916 --> 18:36.916
Hey, kids,

18:38.458 --> 18:40.458
don't trust this sleemo.

18:44.875 --> 18:49.666
I'm sorry,
what name was that reservation under?

18:54.916 --> 18:55.914
No luggage.

18:55.915 --> 18:57.083
And we're in a hurry.

18:57.833 --> 18:59.123
No, no, no, no, no.

18:59.124 --> 19:01.789
Listen, that nice lady
is a ruthless bounty hunter

19:01.790 --> 19:03.539
with a bad grudge.

19:03.540 --> 19:06.039
Most likely
she's already called my name in.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.539
Wizard! This place is like a palace!

19:08.540 --> 19:10.289
Whoa.

19:10.290 --> 19:13.498
Captain would be in a fearsome temper
if he saw this.

19:13.499 --> 19:15.583
I mean, a b-b-buffet?

19:16.958 --> 19:18.414
- Aw.
- Oh, man.

19:18.415 --> 19:20.664
We have to assume
someone is coming after us.

19:20.665 --> 19:22.206
We have to move fast.

19:22.207 --> 19:23.914
In and out.

19:23.915 --> 19:26.456
If Rennod's lair is even still here.

19:26.457 --> 19:28.748
'Tis here. The outside may have changed,

19:28.749 --> 19:31.289
but the lair is deep
in the heart of the mountain.

19:31.290 --> 19:33.956
All who enter face ruin and slaughter.

19:33.957 --> 19:35.373
Fine, great. How do we get in?

19:35.374 --> 19:38.458
Through what they call "the Spa."

19:39.041 --> 19:43.164
But I know he marked the entrance
with his sigil, thusly.

19:43.165 --> 19:45.833
So we split into teams and sear--

19:47.166 --> 19:49.414
Are you listening to any of this?

19:49.415 --> 19:52.416
- Yes. We're listening.
- Oh, yeah? What did I just say?

19:53.458 --> 19:54.956
"Are you listening to any of this?"

19:54.957 --> 19:58.289
A crew of murderous pirates is coming!

19:58.290 --> 20:00.956
Do you understand? We have to move fast!

20:00.957 --> 20:02.581
W-Why are they so mad at you, anyway?

20:02.582 --> 20:04.498
And why does Pokkit hate you?

20:04.499 --> 20:05.914
What happened between you two?

20:05.915 --> 20:07.789
Yeah, why can't you just say sorry?

20:07.790 --> 20:10.248
This is idiotic. We have to hurry.

20:10.249 --> 20:13.373
We're gonna split into two teams
and search the Spa.

20:13.374 --> 20:14.706
I can't go down there.

20:14.707 --> 20:16.581
You worried about corrosion
from the steam?

20:16.582 --> 20:17.748
No.

20:17.749 --> 20:18.831
It--

20:18.832 --> 20:21.039
- It's just gross is all.
- It's okay.

20:21.040 --> 20:23.331
It's okay, you can take...
the Sensory Gymnasium.

20:23.332 --> 20:26.291
You take the Sensory Gymnasium,
Professor Gorelox.

20:27.166 --> 20:28.414
I'm searching the Spa.

20:28.415 --> 20:30.581
- And I must go with my captain.
- Fine.

20:30.582 --> 20:33.456
33, Fern, Wim. You're one--

20:33.457 --> 20:34.914
No, I wanna go with Wim!

20:34.915 --> 20:37.789
- And we wanted to search the buffet!
- We're not searching the buffet!

20:37.790 --> 20:38.998
KB should be on my team.

20:38.999 --> 20:41.039
No, it doesn't matter
whose team who is on!

20:41.040 --> 20:43.914
We're doing it and we're gonna do it
before we get killed by pirates,

20:43.915 --> 20:46.625
am I clear?

20:49.166 --> 20:50.706
Find the symbol,

20:50.707 --> 20:54.873
find At Attin,
and hope that dear, lovely Pokkit

20:54.874 --> 20:57.333
hasn't called in your bounty.

21:00.083 --> 21:05.373
Zentin, Silvo, whatever you call him,
I'm claiming your bounty.

21:05.374 --> 21:08.414
<i>Where is the cowardly wretch?</i>

21:08.415 --> 21:09.831
Here is the coordinates.

21:09.832 --> 21:11.331
Now how about my payment?

21:11.332 --> 21:13.748
<i>You'll have your payment
when I have Silvo.</i>

21:13.749 --> 21:16.248
<i>I'm sending two ships.</i>

21:16.249 --> 21:17.706
<i>And keep this quiet.</i>

21:17.707 --> 21:21.000
I wouldn't dream
of breathing a word to anyone.

21:21.833 --> 21:23.500
I'll be seeing you.

21:33.291 --> 21:35.206
Oh, oh... No, no, sir. Not again.

21:35.207 --> 21:38.416
No, no, please, no. Not again.

21:39.125 --> 21:40.623
See anything familiar, 33?

21:40.624 --> 21:44.748
These pools are supposed to be
for dissolving corpses in acid.

21:44.749 --> 21:45.833
Now look at them.

21:46.416 --> 21:48.706
Does that mud come
from inside the mountain?

21:48.707 --> 21:50.166
In the Captain's day, aye.

21:51.083 --> 21:52.748
Then we'll follow this pipe.

21:52.749 --> 21:54.831
You said the lair's in
the heart of the mountain?

21:54.832 --> 21:56.000
Aye, captain.

21:58.041 --> 21:59.539
Jedi Two, we're following the pipe.

21:59.540 --> 22:01.500
<i>Repeat.
We're following the pipe.</i>

22:03.291 --> 22:04.789
Copy that, Jedi One.

22:04.790 --> 22:07.623
We're looking at a bunch of carvings
by the mud baths.

22:07.624 --> 22:10.956
Captain Rennod's symbol doesn't
look like any of these.

22:10.957 --> 22:13.875
- Let's keep--
- This is taking too long.

22:15.416 --> 22:16.956
No, no,
I haven't seen anyone.

22:16.957 --> 22:20.331
- Did you see? I didn't see, no. No...
- No. I haven't seen him.

22:20.332 --> 22:23.289
Jod. Jod.

22:23.290 --> 22:24.956
Those guards are looking at us.

22:24.957 --> 22:26.248
Just act like you belong.

22:26.249 --> 22:28.833
KB, make sure you cross-reference
all of these.

22:29.500 --> 22:31.250
Okay, stay back. Don't talk.

22:32.708 --> 22:35.248
- Professor Gorelox, is it?
- Yes.

22:35.249 --> 22:38.166
Professor Umiam Gorelox?

22:39.041 --> 22:40.208
Of Scipio?

22:43.333 --> 22:44.333
Run!

23:21.166 --> 23:24.208
Wim. Look.

23:27.375 --> 23:28.833
It's Captain Rennod's sign.

23:32.250 --> 23:35.123
You there, attendant.

23:35.124 --> 23:38.291
I am in need of refreshments.

23:42.416 --> 23:43.416
Yes.

23:44.750 --> 23:45.748
My apologies.

23:45.749 --> 23:49.581
I'll just go get you
a selection of our finest--

23:49.582 --> 23:53.873
You don't smell like an attendant.

23:53.874 --> 23:56.081
Are you an assassin?

23:56.082 --> 23:58.414
Back away from the captain.

23:58.415 --> 24:00.289
I'm warning you.

24:00.290 --> 24:01.750
Ah.

24:02.250 --> 24:04.164
Captain, is it?

24:04.165 --> 24:06.666
Jedi Two, we need help.

24:07.583 --> 24:08.583
Neel!

24:09.750 --> 24:11.666
Everyone, get 'em.

24:12.416 --> 24:15.456
Halt, Dash Zentin!
AKA Mad Captain Silvo.

24:15.457 --> 24:17.625
AKA Jodwick Zank.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.083
Halt!

24:23.625 --> 24:26.831
Now step away from the Wise Elders
and raise your hands.

24:26.832 --> 24:27.914
We're not Elders.

24:27.915 --> 24:29.414
We're kids.

24:29.415 --> 24:31.415
Well, then you're under arrest too.

24:36.666 --> 24:38.166
What are you gonna do with that?

24:57.250 --> 24:58.416
Let's go.

24:59.708 --> 25:00.708
Wait.

25:07.208 --> 25:10.583
The captain needs help
in the grottos below.

25:12.833 --> 25:17.331
And so then, Captain Fern led us
into battle at the head of the Troik Army!

25:17.332 --> 25:20.248
Hmm. Quite a story. Then what happened?

25:20.249 --> 25:21.581
Oh, hey, guys.

25:21.582 --> 25:22.706
This is Cthallops.

25:22.707 --> 25:24.748
Think I heard
something further down.

25:24.749 --> 25:27.291
He said he'd help us
if we entertained him. Over.

25:27.916 --> 25:28.914
Copy.

25:28.915 --> 25:32.623
So this is Jod?

25:32.624 --> 25:34.039
You were right.

25:34.040 --> 25:36.791
- Do not trust him.
- Nice.

25:37.375 --> 25:40.081
- They went this way.
- Well, it's great you're making friends.

25:40.082 --> 25:41.748
Uh, we have a situation here, so...

25:41.749 --> 25:43.623
Cthallops is gonna help us out.

25:43.624 --> 25:44.958
Oh, really?

25:45.458 --> 25:47.916
Cthallops?

26:16.166 --> 26:17.456
<i>Welcome to Lanupa.</i>

26:17.457 --> 26:19.958
<i>A neutral planet where all are welcome
if they keep the--</i>

26:43.000 --> 26:45.498
I smell
the guards approaching.

26:45.499 --> 26:46.873
If you survive,

26:46.874 --> 26:51.039
I'd love to hear
the end of your story someday.

26:51.040 --> 26:53.039
- Thanks, Cthallops!
- Thanks, Cthallops!

26:53.040 --> 26:54.248
Be warned!

26:54.249 --> 26:58.831
Captain Rennod carved a maze of tunnels
and lined 'em with booby-traps.

26:58.832 --> 27:01.706
Follow me, and watch where you step.

27:01.707 --> 27:02.833
Terrific.

27:09.916 --> 27:12.666
Um, how far do you-- Whoa!

27:16.208 --> 27:18.289
Looks like they were decapitated.

27:18.290 --> 27:19.750
Decapitated?

27:29.375 --> 27:30.373
Oops.

27:30.374 --> 27:33.416
- Watch your step.
- I'll bring up the rear.

27:35.458 --> 27:37.791
In case the guards catch up.

27:39.166 --> 27:40.875
Remember, we have a deal.

27:42.208 --> 27:44.289
You only get your reward
when you get us home.

27:44.290 --> 27:48.166
Okay. Okay. I'll go in the middle.

27:52.041 --> 27:54.373
<i>Find that fugitive
and get back up here!</i>

27:54.374 --> 27:56.375
<i>The Spa's being attacked by pirates!</i>

28:20.333 --> 28:22.583
Don't worry, there's--

28:35.041 --> 28:37.456
Silvo!

28:37.457 --> 28:38.833
Damn.

28:39.333 --> 28:40.331
That's them.

28:40.332 --> 28:41.750
Another fake name.

28:44.541 --> 28:48.875
Captain Rennod's lair should lie
directly beneath this chamber.

28:51.458 --> 28:52.458
Great.

28:53.208 --> 28:54.583
Who wants to dive in first?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.333
That's not water.

28:58.833 --> 28:59.833
33?

29:05.708 --> 29:07.706
Appears to be acid, Captain.

29:07.707 --> 29:09.291
'Course it is.

29:10.583 --> 29:11.581
'Course.

29:11.582 --> 29:13.125
This is a good one, isn't it?

29:14.458 --> 29:16.291
Well, there must be a way through.

29:17.625 --> 29:18.914
Look for a lever.

29:18.915 --> 29:21.666
We've gotta get through
before those pirates catch up.

29:35.666 --> 29:41.414
"All who enter paradise
must make the greatest sacrifice."

29:41.415 --> 29:43.039
"Gr-Greatest sacrifice"?

29:43.040 --> 29:44.414
That means...

29:44.415 --> 29:45.958
That means, that's--

29:46.916 --> 29:49.039
- What is that?
- Life.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.831
Someone has to sacrifice their life.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.748
- No, no, no, no. You...
- Oh, my goodness!

29:52.749 --> 29:54.708
You have a lot to learn about pirates.

29:56.625 --> 29:58.623
Tak Rennod was known for killing.

29:58.624 --> 30:00.748
He didn't think twice about taking a life.

30:00.749 --> 30:03.248
He was bad. So what?

30:03.249 --> 30:07.914
So to him,
life was not the greatest sacrifice?

30:07.915 --> 30:09.750
- Uh-uh.
- What was?

30:15.416 --> 30:16.458
- Treasure!
- Treasure!

30:17.541 --> 30:18.791
Treasure.

30:20.041 --> 30:21.748
But you spent all our dataries.

30:21.749 --> 30:23.208
Are there any left?

31:01.458 --> 31:02.541
Ew!

31:07.166 --> 31:08.291
Follow me.

31:09.958 --> 31:12.458
Let's go. Let's go, let's go.

31:17.666 --> 31:19.164
What'd I tell you?

31:19.165 --> 31:20.665
Real adventure.

31:23.958 --> 31:25.000
Close the door!

31:27.500 --> 31:29.125
Well, that won't hold them long.

31:43.833 --> 31:44.873
It's so...

31:44.874 --> 31:46.041
Wizard.

31:47.208 --> 31:50.415
The coordinates will be hidden
in the Captain's datalog.

31:53.208 --> 31:54.375
Focus.

31:55.208 --> 31:56.208
Stop!

31:58.958 --> 32:00.039
Don't touch anything.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.456
Is the plunder booby-trapped too?

32:02.457 --> 32:03.833
Oh, yeah.

32:05.833 --> 32:06.833
Spread out.

32:08.333 --> 32:11.748
Look for something
that looks like a dataport.

32:11.749 --> 32:12.833
Quickly.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.124
And no touching.

32:20.291 --> 32:22.498
What's a dataport look like?

32:22.499 --> 32:24.581
He would have disguised it.

32:24.582 --> 32:27.414
Pirate captains never trust their crew.

32:27.415 --> 32:28.583
It could be anything.

32:52.208 --> 32:54.250
Okay, stop gawking.

32:54.750 --> 32:55.875
Let's hurry this up.

32:56.625 --> 32:57.914
What are we even looking for?

32:57.915 --> 33:00.875
A dataport or something. I don't know.

33:01.875 --> 33:03.833
Something that looks off.

33:04.875 --> 33:06.000
Is this something?

33:07.041 --> 33:09.581
All of the food on the table looks rotten.

33:09.582 --> 33:13.291
Except that roast,
it looks fresh from the cooker.

33:23.750 --> 33:24.750
I'll do it.

33:43.375 --> 33:45.498
'Tis the captain's log.

33:45.499 --> 33:48.791
33, access this dataport.

33:49.791 --> 33:51.833
Captain?

33:57.916 --> 34:03.125
Searching, searching,
searching, searching...

34:05.291 --> 34:06.375
Arr!

34:11.166 --> 34:12.539
Oh, that's it! Home!

34:12.540 --> 34:13.625
At Attin!

34:15.541 --> 34:16.958
Yes! Yes!

34:17.541 --> 34:19.625
You have access to, uh, this system?

34:20.583 --> 34:21.583
Aye.

34:22.458 --> 34:24.333
Refill that chamber with acid.

34:27.375 --> 34:29.500
Acid!

34:33.208 --> 34:34.875
Silvo!

34:36.125 --> 34:37.664
Now.

34:37.665 --> 34:38.750
The treasure,

34:40.083 --> 34:42.500
is it really on the planet?
Is it on At Attin?

34:43.166 --> 34:44.706
Is it real?

34:44.707 --> 34:47.790
Treasure is mentioned
in the Captain's log.

34:49.583 --> 34:51.166
Let me see the old devil.

34:57.500 --> 34:59.706
<i>I have the ship,</i>

34:59.707 --> 35:01.998
<i>clad in armor and ready,</i>

35:01.999 --> 35:05.789
<i>but my crew still doubts At Attin is real.</i>

35:05.790 --> 35:07.206
What's wrong with the picture?

35:07.207 --> 35:10.873
- Quiet!
<i>- I need all hands to seize the treasure.</i>

35:10.874 --> 35:17.289
<i>No one knows
it is the last Old Republic Mint.</i>

35:17.290 --> 35:18.375
That's enough.

35:28.625 --> 35:30.625
An Old Republic Mint...

35:32.583 --> 35:33.833
What's a mint again?

35:35.250 --> 35:37.331
It's where they make money.

35:37.332 --> 35:41.081
Make money?
So you could have infinite money?

35:41.082 --> 35:44.666
Whoa! I guess it is the planet
of eternal treasure.

35:46.250 --> 35:47.706
Jod, remember what you promised.

35:47.707 --> 35:50.041
You take us home,
you get a fair reward. Right?

35:51.000 --> 35:52.833
Yeah. We still have a deal. Right?

36:11.958 --> 36:15.414
I invoke my right to challenge the captain
as per the Code.

36:15.415 --> 36:16.498
What?

36:16.499 --> 36:18.123
The challenge is thrown.

36:18.124 --> 36:20.664
Hand-to-hand combat, to the death.

36:20.665 --> 36:22.039
What? 33!

36:22.040 --> 36:25.125
I'm sorry, Captain.
I must follow the Pirate's Code.

36:26.000 --> 36:27.166
Just say you yield.

36:29.041 --> 36:30.416
And I won't have to hurt you.

36:33.166 --> 36:34.500
Just say you yield.

36:37.875 --> 36:40.833
Yield and I won't hurt you.

36:49.833 --> 36:51.333
Just say you yield.

37:07.083 --> 37:09.708
Jod, no!

37:10.708 --> 37:12.666
I'm really sorry about this. I really am.

37:13.833 --> 37:15.331
You have to actually say it.

37:15.332 --> 37:16.956
You're a grown-up!

37:16.957 --> 37:19.916
You can't fight us, we're just kids!

37:20.708 --> 37:21.916
It's not fair.

37:35.666 --> 37:36.956
Careful, Wim.

37:36.957 --> 37:39.000
It's not one of your stories.

37:56.083 --> 37:57.208
Come on.

37:58.125 --> 37:59.125
Say it!

38:07.625 --> 38:08.706
- I yield.
- Okay.

38:08.707 --> 38:11.123
I'm sorry, Fern.

38:11.124 --> 38:12.998
Jod is the victor.

38:12.999 --> 38:15.208
Orders, Ca--Captain Jod?

38:16.291 --> 38:17.833
We need another way out.

38:20.083 --> 38:21.083
First,

38:22.833 --> 38:24.125
take this lot prisoner.

38:25.125 --> 38:29.914
Charges, mutinous intent
against their captain.

38:29.915 --> 38:31.416
33, no!

38:33.458 --> 38:36.664
I'm sorry, kids.

38:36.665 --> 38:37.875
Captain's orders.

38:38.458 --> 38:40.750
Wait. I know!
