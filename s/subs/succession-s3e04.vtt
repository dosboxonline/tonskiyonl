There's so much good shit
on the Waystar raid.

00:18.727 --> 00:19.936

Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

Totally.

-Uh, no, nothing. Um...

00:59.058 --> 01:00.560
I have this, like, stupid worry

01:00.643 --> 01:02.520
that I'm gonna go over

01:02.604 --> 01:05.356
and there will be, like, goons
and stooges

01:05.440 --> 01:08.276
and rough-jacks there
to administer a beating.

01:08.359 --> 01:11.738
Well, honestly, he'll try to
turn you against me.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.740
Right?

01:13.823 --> 01:16.034
-GREG: Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-And that's fine.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.703
Because you're not
gonna turn against me.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.163
No, no, no. No!

01:20.246 --> 01:21.623
-No way!
-Are you gonna turn against me?

01:21.706 --> 01:24.793
No way, man. I'm sturdy!

01:24.876 --> 01:27.837
-I'm a sturdy... birdy.

04:35.566 --> 04:41.072
Yeah, the temperature of the DOJ
investigation, the raid here,

04:41.155 --> 04:43.908
it's caused serious
blowback from investors.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.618

And noisily.

05:01.134 --> 05:04.012
His fingers on
the big red button, Ken.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.723
We've talked to him
about what we can do

05:06.806 --> 05:08.224
and he's playing hard to get.

05:08.307 --> 05:09.517
But...

05:09.600 --> 05:13.730
he was interested in time in
the room with you and your dad.

05:13.813 --> 05:14.856
Together?

05:15.231 --> 05:16.315
No.

05:16.399 --> 05:19.027
Yeah, his thing was, I guess,
to know how this goes.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.029
He wants his
pound of flesh, all right?

05:21.112 --> 05:22.905
GERRI:<i> Uh, Kendall,</i>
<i>he just wants to make sure</i>

05:22.989 --> 05:25.199

05:25.283 --> 05:28.202
Yeah, well, obviously,
I can't meet jointly with Dad.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.622
It's just a half hour

05:31.706 --> 05:34.751
Kendall, we are four days out

05:34.834 --> 05:38.046
KARL MULLER:<i> Kendall, it's about</i>
<i>control of the company,</i>
<i>all right?</i>

05:38.129 --> 05:40.256
The vote is on a razor's edge.

05:40.339 --> 05:41.966
We need his four percent.

05:42.050 --> 05:45.136
Unless you think that any of us
would have a bright future

05:45.219 --> 05:47.847
<i>with Sandy and Stewy</i>
<i>in control of the firm.</i>

05:48.848 --> 05:52.560
So, um, he's suggesting
in four hours...

05:52.643 --> 05:55.104
No, no, no. No!
You don't railroad me. No.

05:55.188 --> 05:56.647
I need to run this by my team.

05:56.731 --> 05:59.859
Me and Dad together,
the optics are janky as fuck.

05:59.942 --> 06:02.737
Come! Behave appropriately!

06:02.820 --> 06:04.197
KENDALL:<i> Oh, hey, Dad!</i>

06:04.280 --> 06:06.908
Come on, when have I ever
not behaved appropriately?

06:06.991 --> 06:08.743
<i>This just doesn't work for me.</i>

06:08.826 --> 06:11.537

06:24.050 --> 06:25.093
how bad is it?

06:26.844 --> 06:30.098
Well, I'm hearing that the raid
was just a warning shot.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.725
So, things should
settle down now.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.477
I think I need more people.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.270
More protection.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.648
Dad, you have
two former Deputy AG's

06:38.731 --> 06:40.441
and the ex-head of Fraud
at Main Justice.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.110
These are
the Harlem Globetrotters,

06:42.193 --> 06:43.778
the Westchester Judge-fuckers.

06:43.861 --> 06:46.364
The Raisin owes me everything.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.616
And now I need
a bit of fucking cover,

06:48.699 --> 06:51.410
the forgetful cunt's gone AWOL.

06:51.494 --> 06:55.039
I think perhaps, we have been
insufficiently rigorous,

06:55.123 --> 06:58.084
journalistically,
on the President.

06:58.167 --> 07:00.503
You think he'll respond well
to a little bit of pressure?

07:00.586 --> 07:03.005
Well, every time I call
Michelle-Anne, she tells me,

07:03.089 --> 07:04.173
"Be patient!

07:04.924 --> 07:06.384
The cavalry is coming!"

07:06.968 --> 07:08.261
I need leverage.

07:09.053 --> 07:10.930
I have Connor, again.

07:11.430 --> 07:13.015
See? See?

07:13.099 --> 07:14.267
I'm in a corner.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.518
Everyone wants a piece.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.688
Everyone's out of their box.
Everything's coming up fuck.

07:18.771 --> 07:20.773
I want you on fire-watch, okay?

07:20.857 --> 07:23.484
Yeah, okay, Dad. Absolutely.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.863
And, uh, watch the negotiations.

07:26.946 --> 07:31.033
Karl's a smart bastard
but, uh, he likes to be liked.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.202
-Not good.
-Got it.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.376
Okay, so can we strategize?
I got potential gold here.

07:40.459 --> 07:42.211
But I need your read
on how to deploy.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.755
Roman, could you please
put your footwear on?

07:44.839 --> 07:48.384
Uh, see, for this to work,
we need, you know, boundaries.

07:48.467 --> 07:50.720
-And--
-What, I can't take
my footwear off?

07:50.803 --> 07:52.054
Well, it's just--

07:52.138 --> 07:54.599
What, I can't masturbate in
a time and place of my choosing?

07:54.682 --> 07:55.892
-See that?
-You are building...

07:55.975 --> 07:57.059
-That will kill us.
-...a police state here, Gerri.

07:57.143 --> 07:58.227
I found tattoo man.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.645
-"Tattoo man"?
-ROMAN ROY: Yup.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.940
Funny little story.
So, about fifteen-ish years ago,

08:03.024 --> 08:04.358
Kendall's bachelor party
in New Orleans,

08:04.442 --> 08:05.860
we did this, like...

08:05.943 --> 08:09.197
ironic bar crawl thing
on Bourbon Street.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.199
And we got chatting
with this, you know,

08:11.949 --> 08:13.784
friendly hobo.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.621
And there was talk of,
you know, various...

08:16.704 --> 08:19.665
disgusting endeavors
like, you know,

08:19.749 --> 08:21.709
"Would the hobo eat
a deep-fried deck shoe?"

08:21.792 --> 08:24.086
(FAKE LAUGHS) You know, stupid,
whatever, bullshit.

08:24.170 --> 08:26.172
Before we settled on a rather...

08:26.255 --> 08:29.258
indecent proposal
which was to...

08:29.342 --> 08:31.135
get the homeless man to have

08:31.219 --> 08:33.763
Kendall's name tattooed
on his forehead.

08:33.846 --> 08:34.931
What?

08:35.014 --> 08:37.934
Yeah, we got Kendall's initials
tattooed on a rando.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.436
And you think this is
a good idea to dredge this up?

08:40.519 --> 08:42.521
On Kendall? Woke-ahontas?

08:42.605 --> 08:44.982
Using a poor's forehead
as a Post-It?

08:45.066 --> 08:46.609
It's fucking killer,
are you kidding me?

08:46.692 --> 08:48.069
Well, I'm not so sure.

08:48.152 --> 08:50.821
Okay, well, we can talk about it
over lunch, maybe?

08:50.905 --> 08:53.324
Uh, not today, Roman,
I have a date.

08:53.407 --> 08:55.618
Fuck off! With who?
Montgomery Clift?

08:55.701 --> 08:57.453
-The Ghost of Christmas Past?
-GERRI: Laurie.

08:57.536 --> 08:58.788
-Who?
-Laurie.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.206
He's ex-DOJ.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.875
He worked
the Arthur Anderson prosecution.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.961
I want to see if there's
a back channel there.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.128
ROMAN: Laurie?

09:06.212 --> 09:07.630
And you said he wants to

09:07.713 --> 09:09.465
back-channel you
in the parking lot or--

09:09.548 --> 09:11.384
Yeah, so, the thing is,
I'm dating.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.303
I am dating
and that needs to be understood.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.805
Okay, I get it. Yeah, yeah.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.598
You're drawing a line.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.267
Or otherwise, you know...

09:19.350 --> 09:21.978
Laurie will knock my
jolly old block off.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.271
If he can...

09:23.354 --> 09:27.650
find his sword stick and fire up
his motorized bath chair.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.653
All right.

09:37.326 --> 09:38.786
GREG: Good morning!

09:39.620 --> 09:41.330
LOGAN: Ah!

09:42.206 --> 09:43.374
Greg.

09:44.333 --> 09:45.334
Drink.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.087
-Uh, alcohol?
-Uh-huh.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.213
Um...

09:49.672 --> 09:50.631
sure, I--

09:50.715 --> 09:52.008
It's early but I--

09:52.091 --> 09:56.220
Yeah, I think I'll actually have
me a nice glass of rum and coke.

09:57.138 --> 09:58.139
Kerry!

09:59.223 --> 10:02.184
Can we bring, uh, Greg
some Coca-Cola?

10:02.268 --> 10:03.352
No, it's fine really.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.354
-Uh, she doesn't have to--
-LOGAN: No, no, no.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.983
What Greg wants... (EXHALES)
...Greg must have.

10:09.066 --> 10:13.321
Thank you. Like, so kind.
Ridicu-- I don't know.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.489
Uh...

10:15.573 --> 10:18.659
You and Kendall
have been hanging around a lot.

10:18.743 --> 10:19.785
Correct?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.454
I am, um...

10:21.537 --> 10:23.497
It's purely social, you know.

10:23.581 --> 10:26.625
The thing is
your position at Waystar...

10:26.709 --> 10:31.005
could become complicated if you
get too associated with him.

10:31.422 --> 10:32.423
Hmm?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.551
-You can see that?
-(GROANS)

all very, very concerned.

-(JOSH SIGHS)
-How's Kitty?

21:44.261 --> 21:46.555
She's, uh, good. Better.
It was dumb.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.265
She had a fever this morning.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.516
-But, um...
-Fuck.

21:49.599 --> 21:51.727
...I just didn't wanna
come into the city.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.270
I hope that's okay?

21:53.353 --> 21:55.105
How's your, uh... Iverson?

21:55.188 --> 21:56.523
-Yeah, great. Great.
-Yeah?

21:56.606 --> 21:58.942
I just bought him
a fucking giant rabbit.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.068
So, now he's, like, Googling

22:00.152 --> 22:01.737
where he can buy
the world's biggest carrot.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.113
(BOTH LAUGH)

22:03.196 --> 22:04.906
-That's fucking hilarious.
-It's good.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.783
(LAUGHS) Hilarious.

22:06.867 --> 22:08.910
-Come outside. Take a look.
-Yeah.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.330
-KENDALL: Nice spot.
-JOSH AARONSON: Yeah.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.666
(BIRDS SQUAWKING)

22:14.750 --> 22:15.917
So, where's the big man?

22:17.002 --> 22:19.755
Ah, it's all good.
He-- he had to take a call.

22:19.838 --> 22:20.964
He sent me ahead.

22:24.426 --> 22:25.469
It's all good?

22:27.220 --> 22:28.138
I don't know. Sure.

22:28.221 --> 22:29.973
It's all terrible.
It's all good.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.808
You know. Whatever.

22:31.892 --> 22:32.976
(CHUCKLES) Right?

22:33.060 --> 22:35.437
I don't know. I guess
that's my whole question.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.607
We should probably wait
for the old man.

22:39.441 --> 22:41.359
But yeah, look, it's a fuck-pie.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.320
But end of the day,
it's not that complicated.

22:44.154 --> 22:46.740
Like, I'm better than my dad.

22:46.823 --> 22:49.701
But my dad is still better
than Sandy and Stewy.

22:50.994 --> 22:54.790
Yeah. My other option is,
I... just get out.

22:56.750 --> 22:57.751

-We buy GoJo.
-Uh-huh.

-It's a little overpriced.
-KENDALL: I don't know.

You know, I like you.
Outside of all this, I really...

23:27.155 --> 23:29.908
-I really like you.
-I like you too, pal.

23:29.991 --> 23:32.536
Big fucking nervous breakdown
of a party for my fortieth.

23:32.619 --> 23:34.287
-You gotta come.
-Yeah, who's going?

23:35.038 --> 23:37.082
What, you need the list?

23:37.165 --> 23:40.168
You, me, and Henry Kissinger!
Fuck you! I know everybody.

coming all this way.

-Hey, Dad.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.546
-Grab a seat.
-Hmm.

So, uh... (CHUCKLES)

24:28.300 --> 24:30.677
(CLEARS THROAT)
Sorry for all this.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.889
Look, I know
you're pressed for time.

24:33.972 --> 24:37.392
I just wanted to, uh, check in.

24:37.475 --> 24:41.438
As an investor,
but, uh, you know, also as a...

24:42.731 --> 24:43.982
as a friend.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.194
You know, I guess
I have concerns.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.362
Let me tell you, hand on heart.

24:49.446 --> 24:51.865
Whatever the turbulence
in the short term,

24:51.948 --> 24:55.368
there is nothing
that's a significant issue.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.037

is the core business

24:57.120 --> 24:59.998
and the volatility
is priced in now.

back me, sit tight,

in your castle here,

and I'll make you whole.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.554
Okay?

25:17.098 --> 25:20.393
No, it doesn't work like that.
Can we take a walk?

it's disgusting. I mean...

-JOSH: Yeah.
-How far?

Come on, Dad. Let's walk it out.

or shall we walk?

25:38.453 --> 25:40.455
Sure! Let's walk.

-Thank you.
-Hi.

-Yes.

to be a dick here.

But, uh, I'm looking. And, um--

26:52.360 --> 26:53.945

27:12.839 --> 27:13.882
that's a shame.

had something there.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.552
It was really working for you.

Do you mind?

-Excuse me.

like a "K" to you?

Yeah, I'm not super proud
of what I did.

any photos of it out there.

28:07.143 --> 28:10.230
uh, make this too

how much for the photos?

what you want.

to get it back.

gonna get me that back?

31:40.815 --> 31:42.942
And here's me, going to jail.

31:44.110 --> 31:46.279
And you're gonna be
living in a magical castle.

31:46.362 --> 31:48.781
And I am going to be
down in a dungeon

31:48.865 --> 31:52.660
somewhere, sucking off ogres
for phone cards. (LAUGHS)

31:52.744 --> 31:55.496
No, I mean, who even knows?
This probably won't work--

31:55.580 --> 31:57.332
Greg what do you
know about, um...

31:58.207 --> 32:00.001
Nero and Sporus?

32:00.084 --> 32:01.836
Nero and...

32:01.919 --> 32:03.004
TOM: Sporus.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.422
-Spor--
-TOM: Greg, yeah.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.468
Sporus was a young slave boy.

32:09.302 --> 32:10.928
He was Nero's favorite.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.013
And, uh...

32:12.096 --> 32:13.598
you know what Nero did to him?

32:13.681 --> 32:15.350
"Nero and Sporus". I don't--

32:15.433 --> 32:17.226
This is not IP
I'm familiar with.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.228
Well, Nero...

32:20.438 --> 32:21.731
pushed his wife...

32:22.482 --> 32:24.317
down the stairs.

32:24.400 --> 32:29.364
And then he had Sporus castrated
and he married him instead.

32:29.447 --> 32:30.990
And he gave him a ring.

32:31.074 --> 32:33.493
And he made him dress up
like his dead wife.

32:33.826 --> 32:35.411
Wow!

32:35.495 --> 32:37.205
Plot twist!
Didn't see that coming.

32:37.288 --> 32:39.666
Yeah, I bought a book on
the Romans to read in prison.

32:39.749 --> 32:41.834
-It's a big book.
Well, is it a good book?

32:41.918 --> 32:43.252
TOM: It's a decent book, yeah.

32:45.963 --> 32:48.132
I'd castrate you
and marry you in a heartbeat.

32:49.258 --> 32:50.259
(CHUCKLES)

32:54.889 --> 32:56.182
(CLICKS TONGUE)

32:58.309 --> 33:00.061
-Are you okay, Tom?
-Hey!

33:00.144 --> 33:01.979
See if you can wrestle me
into the ground, Greg.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.022
-No.
-TOM: Come on.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.273
-I don't want to--
-Come on. Let's--

33:04.357 --> 33:05.525
Come on,
let's fight like chickens.

33:05.608 --> 33:06.901
-GREG: No, I--
-(IMITATES CHICKEN) Come on!

33:06.984 --> 33:09.862
Come on! Come on. Let's have
a little punching match.

33:09.946 --> 33:11.447
-No, no.
-(TOM CLUCKING)

33:11.531 --> 33:13.866
Come on! Fight me
like a rooster, you weakling!

33:13.950 --> 33:16.160
-Please, Tom! Stop!
-Come on!

33:16.244 --> 33:18.037
-Stop. I don't want to, man!
-Why are you such a cock?

33:18.121 --> 33:19.706
I don't want to!

33:19.789 --> 33:21.374
I don't wanna do it!

33:21.457 --> 33:23.668
(MOCKS) "I don't wanna do it!
I don't wanna do it!
I don't wanna do it!"

33:25.461 --> 33:26.838
Neither do I, Greg!

33:29.340 --> 33:30.758
It was a joke, you idiot.

33:32.093 --> 33:33.803
You're so hard to riff with.

33:33.886 --> 33:37.724
I mean that is a big career
obstacle right there for you.

33:38.349 --> 33:39.350
Big!

33:39.976 --> 33:41.018
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

33:45.148 --> 33:46.232
Come on, man.

33:48.443 --> 33:50.111
Yeah, I guess the, uh...

33:51.279 --> 33:54.365
the actual easiest thing
for me would be, uh...

33:55.742 --> 33:57.702
you know, Kendall,

33:57.785 --> 34:00.747
probably isn't too late for you
to backpedal on all your shit

34:00.830 --> 34:02.749
and just, you know...

34:02.832 --> 34:05.960
say you were wrong or
just fuzzle it up, you know.

34:06.043 --> 34:08.671
Just back off and cool it down.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.089
Hmm?

34:10.173 --> 34:12.967
No, that's not possible.

34:13.050 --> 34:16.262
I wasn't wrong
and that destroys my reputation.

34:17.221 --> 34:18.723
You should listen to him, son.

34:25.354 --> 34:26.522
Is this what this is?

34:27.690 --> 34:29.067
-What is this?
-What?

34:29.150 --> 34:32.195
I've been brought out here to be
roughed up by the two of you?

34:32.278 --> 34:33.946
-Is that what this is?
-No, no, no, no, no.

34:34.030 --> 34:36.574
"Things just got out of hand.
You were mistaken.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.326
Things went too far."

34:38.409 --> 34:39.452
No, no way.

34:39.535 --> 34:41.579
Maybe just quiet down
a little bit, all right?

34:41.662 --> 34:42.997
You've made your point,
all right?

34:43.080 --> 34:44.791
Maybe just, you know...

34:44.874 --> 34:47.293
we could just close up
the outrage shop.

34:47.376 --> 34:49.378
Leave it for
the DOJ to investigate.

34:52.673 --> 34:54.175
Are you guys trying to
fuck me here?

34:54.258 --> 34:55.635
-Ken--
-KENDALL: I see this!

34:55.718 --> 34:56.886
Whoa, hey.

34:57.845 --> 34:59.347
Easy. Easy, friend.

34:59.430 --> 35:00.473
-All right.
-Let's go.

35:01.390 --> 35:03.559
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

35:08.773 --> 35:09.982
You okay, son?

35:12.276 --> 35:15.404
Some of those drugs you do
can make you paranoid.

35:15.488 --> 35:16.531
Is that right?

35:18.157 --> 35:22.662
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

35:27.125 --> 35:28.376
-Hey!
-FRANK: Hi. Hi.

35:28.459 --> 35:29.877
Any updates from Dad?

35:29.961 --> 35:32.672
(SCOFFS) Radio silence, so...

35:32.755 --> 35:34.966
either everything going
to plan or...

35:35.049 --> 35:37.093
-they've stabbed
each other to death.
-Uh-huh.

35:38.261 --> 35:40.972
And where are we at with
the Sandy and Stewy negotiation?

35:42.014 --> 35:43.641
KARL: Oh, um...

35:43.724 --> 35:44.767
Pardon me.

Momentarily broken.

35:47.728 --> 35:48.896
Oh, yeah?

35:48.980 --> 35:50.940
Yeah, they're just grabbing
a quick bite while they wait on

35:51.023 --> 35:52.900
-the turnaround of the document.
-SHIV: Uh-huh.

35:54.610 --> 35:56.028
But in terms of the temperature?

35:56.112 --> 35:58.531
Uh, it's attritional, huh?

35:58.614 --> 36:00.575
-Yeah.
-SHIV: Oh, great.

36:00.658 --> 36:02.034
But just so I'm clear,

36:02.118 --> 36:04.245
we're hung up on what exactly?

36:04.328 --> 36:06.289
Well, the last, um...

36:06.956 --> 36:08.916
break-out session was

36:09.000 --> 36:12.044
some specifics about
the non-disparagement clause.

36:12.128 --> 36:13.170
We're still on that?

36:14.797 --> 36:17.967
I mean, don't we have bigger
things like the stand-still?

36:18.050 --> 36:19.427
KARL: Maybe, but...

36:19.510 --> 36:21.387
what we're really trying
to scope out here

36:21.470 --> 36:24.348
is if actually there
is a deal space?

36:24.432 --> 36:27.852
Sure, but do we have time?

36:28.853 --> 36:29.896
Or do we just send

36:29.979 --> 36:32.523
one of you two big-hitters
down there and...

36:32.607 --> 36:34.192
bang some heads together?

36:34.275 --> 36:35.776
Pull 'em out of the weeds, huh?

36:37.778 --> 36:38.905
Uh...

36:39.780 --> 36:41.073
It's an option. Sure.

36:41.490 --> 36:42.783
SHIV: Great!

36:42.867 --> 36:45.953
Okay, well, any big news
or vibrations...

36:47.204 --> 36:49.999
-let me know.
-We absolutely will.

36:50.082 --> 36:51.167
SHIV: Thanks, guys.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.174
JOSH: Ah, it's good, yeah?

36:58.883 --> 37:00.843
KENDALL: Yeah. It's great.

37:04.472 --> 37:05.640
Your dad's okay?

37:06.891 --> 37:08.309
Yeah, he's fine.

37:08.392 --> 37:11.187
So, uh, come on.
What do you have on him?

37:13.648 --> 37:14.982
You know, I'd really...

37:15.524 --> 37:16.734
rather not say.

37:16.817 --> 37:17.860
Legally.

37:17.944 --> 37:19.570
I mean, I guess
it's difficult, right?

37:19.654 --> 37:23.074
I mean, if you have jack-shit
you look like a fake.

37:23.157 --> 37:25.117
If you have really damaging
shit, you make me

37:25.201 --> 37:27.036
maybe want to run away, right?

37:28.371 --> 37:30.539
-Well, he's implicated.
-Uh-huh.

37:32.541 --> 37:33.542
Hey.

37:35.586 --> 37:37.922
-Just riffing.
-Uh-huh, uh-huh.

-Hey!

37:51.435 --> 37:54.981
Yeah, so,
it's a no on Ravenhead.

37:55.064 --> 37:56.232
-SHIV: Oh?
-Yeah.

37:56.315 --> 37:58.567
He just doesn't see how
he can accommodate the pivot.

37:58.651 --> 37:59.610
Huh.

37:59.694 --> 38:01.821
-Well, that's unfortunate.
-TOM: Yeah.

38:01.904 --> 38:04.365
Yeah, he was fairly unpleasant
about it all.

38:04.448 --> 38:08.452
Uh-huh? But I heard that...
Greg's a lock.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.621
-Yeah? He signed the JDA, so...
-TOM: Uh...

38:12.415 --> 38:13.791
-You nailed that.
-TOM: Yeah.

38:13.874 --> 38:15.209
That's about my level.

minion wrangler and shit-eater.

38:19.338 --> 38:20.548
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

38:21.173 --> 38:22.299
You doing okay?

38:23.217 --> 38:24.552
Is it the seniority thing?

38:24.635 --> 38:26.512
-No.
-SHIV: Or the...

38:27.638 --> 38:28.723
you know, the...

38:28.806 --> 38:29.974
prison possibility?

38:31.976 --> 38:33.894
(SIGHS) I just...

38:33.978 --> 38:36.772
I just keep thinking about,
you know,

38:36.856 --> 38:38.274
you know, when we get home,

38:38.899 --> 38:40.109
uh, before dinner

38:40.192 --> 38:42.987
we have that very first glass
of cold white wine.

38:43.070 --> 38:44.321
-SHIV: Uh-huh.
-On an empty stomach,

38:44.405 --> 38:46.574
you know that
very cold glass of wine?

38:46.657 --> 38:48.409
I fucking love that!

38:48.492 --> 38:49.785
I just love that and I...

38:50.619 --> 38:51.620
And so I did a bit of research

38:51.704 --> 38:54.081
and I got deep
into the prison blogs again.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.375
-Oh, honey!
-You know, about "toilet wine".

38:56.459 --> 38:58.794
And turns out you can make it
from fruit and ketchup

38:58.878 --> 39:02.214
but you have to "burp"
the wine back as it ferments.

39:02.298 --> 39:05.593
And I thought, "What if I forget
to burp the toilet wine?"

39:05.676 --> 39:07.762
But the truth is
I'm not gonna get wine

39:07.845 --> 39:10.222
of any temperature
in prison, Shiv.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.099
There are no
fine wines in prison.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.809
You don't get to
choose what you eat.

39:13.893 --> 39:16.187

say what you do.

When is "lights out"?

39:21.358 --> 39:23.861

I'm fucking terrified, Shiv.

39:25.529 --> 39:26.655
Hey, it's--

39:30.326 --> 39:31.535
I mean, uh--

39:32.453 --> 39:33.954
I don't know
what I can say to you.

-I've just spoken to Karl.

with your level of input.

Okay. Well, fuck him, right?

40:03.692 --> 40:05.778
I don't need another toothache.

40:05.861 --> 40:09.156
Well, you okayed me to
go in there and kick some ass.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.159
-And I barely--
-I gave you a destination.

40:13.202 --> 40:14.787
I can't walk you there, okay?

40:14.870 --> 40:17.623
Okay, Dad,
but if you give in to Karl,

40:17.706 --> 40:19.667
then everyone starts
to carve me out.

40:19.750 --> 40:20.960
There's a line.

40:21.043 --> 40:23.170
<i>-And--</i>
-Nothing is a line.

40:23.254 --> 40:26.841
Everything everywhere
is always moving forever.

40:27.842 --> 40:28.884
Get used to it.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.261
Okay.

40:41.230 --> 40:42.606
LOGAN: So, Josh...

40:43.732 --> 40:44.817
where are we on this?

40:44.900 --> 40:47.695
You know, I have a wife at home.
(LAUGHS)

40:48.320 --> 40:50.114
Uh, thank you.

40:50.614 --> 40:51.615
Uh...

40:52.074 --> 40:53.242
Well, uh...

40:54.410 --> 40:55.452
help yourself.

40:58.539 --> 41:01.167
Uh, I hear you
on the fundamentals.

41:02.626 --> 41:04.003
You know.

41:04.086 --> 41:06.213
I mean, fuck Sandy and Stewy.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.132
That's just
financial engineering and...

41:08.841 --> 41:10.259
I can do that myself, right?

41:10.342 --> 41:11.719
Yeah, absolutely.

41:11.802 --> 41:12.928
But this...

41:13.012 --> 41:14.346
this still feels off.

41:14.430 --> 41:15.806
I mean, Ken, it feels like...

41:17.099 --> 41:18.726
I mean, you want your dad
to go to jail?

41:20.561 --> 41:23.439
Well, uh,
that's not for me to say.

41:23.522 --> 41:24.815
JOSH: I mean,
it kind of is, though.

41:24.899 --> 41:28.027
Like if you were a judge,
you'd want him to go to prison?

41:28.110 --> 41:30.362
I believe the traditional
whistleblowing process

41:30.446 --> 41:31.697
would be subverted.

41:31.780 --> 41:33.282
-So, that's why I--
-JOSH: Uh, but Logan,

41:33.365 --> 41:34.867
the reputational hit?

41:34.950 --> 41:36.535
I mean, optically,

41:36.619 --> 41:37.828
maybe you become...

41:38.621 --> 41:39.705
a punchline.

41:39.788 --> 41:41.749
One of those big guys
who aren't coming back.

41:42.541 --> 41:44.251
When is this gonna end?

41:44.335 --> 41:46.337
I'm hearing separate planes.

41:46.420 --> 41:47.588
I gotta say...

41:47.671 --> 41:49.924
I don't like betting
on blood feuds.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.885
It ends with me in control...

41:53.719 --> 41:54.803
slapped wrists,

41:55.429 --> 41:56.513
and a payout.

41:57.556 --> 41:58.682
That stuff...

41:59.642 --> 42:00.643

42:01.310 --> 42:02.853

42:02.937 --> 42:04.146
JOSH: Here's the disconnect.

42:04.772 --> 42:06.565
See, I think that...

42:08.317 --> 42:09.443
end of the day...

42:10.819 --> 42:12.696
you work for the shareholders.

42:14.156 --> 42:15.199
For me.

42:16.992 --> 42:20.079
But I think that you think

42:20.162 --> 42:23.707
that I'm some dipshit who had
a lucky night at the casino,

42:23.791 --> 42:25.000
who acts all fancy,

42:25.084 --> 42:28.003
and then makes you eat fucking
rodents for my pleasure.

42:28.087 --> 42:29.129
Right?

42:31.048 --> 42:32.466
But I have a gun at your head.

42:33.759 --> 42:37.805
And I need to know if this is
gonna be a functional situation.

42:38.681 --> 42:40.057
And I'm sure you're gonna say,

42:40.140 --> 42:42.226
"Yes, it is going to be
a functional situation."

42:42.309 --> 42:43.602
But I'm gonna need
to hear you say

42:43.686 --> 42:45.145
that it's
a functional situation.

42:45.896 --> 42:47.856
So, can you work together?

42:49.984 --> 42:51.777
-Uh-huh.
-Sure. Absolutely.

42:52.194 --> 42:54.446
(LAUGHS)

42:55.239 --> 42:57.116
Oh, fuck. This is tough.

42:58.701 --> 43:01.245
This is-- It's fucking tough,
I gotta say. 'Cause...

43:04.206 --> 43:06.834
I don't really believe you.
I mean, I kinda don't.

43:10.462 --> 43:11.505
It'll be okay.

43:14.425 --> 43:15.551
It'll be okay...

43:16.385 --> 43:18.095
because he's a good kid.

43:18.178 --> 43:19.722
-He's a good kid?
-LOGAN: Yeah.

43:20.597 --> 43:21.682
He's a good kid.

43:25.269 --> 43:26.854
-Okay.
-LOGAN: Yeah.

43:26.937 --> 43:28.814
He did what he thought was best.

43:28.897 --> 43:31.233
I think he went too far, but...

43:32.067 --> 43:33.110
he's a good kid.

43:34.445 --> 43:35.696
Yeah?

43:35.779 --> 43:37.114
He's a good kid...

43:39.074 --> 43:40.159
and I love him.

43:41.744 --> 43:42.828
LOGAN: I mean...

43:43.620 --> 43:44.997
there'll be a big number.

43:45.080 --> 43:48.459
We'll pay, he'll mew and cry
and-- and I'll get it.

43:48.542 --> 43:50.502
It'll all be okay.

43:51.170 --> 43:52.171
And...

43:53.380 --> 43:54.381
maybe...

43:55.382 --> 43:56.592
it'll be him one day.

43:57.760 --> 43:58.927
It's in his blood.

43:59.845 --> 44:01.263
He learned it all from me.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.224
And maybe...

44:05.809 --> 44:07.853
maybe he's the best one
of all of them.

44:08.979 --> 44:09.980
So, yeah...

44:10.939 --> 44:11.982
it'll be okay.

44:13.275 --> 44:14.276
Wow!

44:16.862 --> 44:17.863

Oh, no, that's fine.
It's not editorial.

53:22.198 --> 53:23.325
Oh.

53:24.659 --> 53:25.702
SHIV: Thanks, Wanda.

53:29.664 --> 53:30.749
-Hey!
-MARK: Hi.

53:30.832 --> 53:33.460
-It is editorial, so...
-Yeah.

53:33.543 --> 53:34.961
I have a line for you
on the President

53:35.045 --> 53:37.839
that we'd like you to
start rolling out immediately.

53:37.923 --> 53:39.674
We're open to suggestions,
but, uh,

53:39.758 --> 53:43.011
we just feel like
our general ideological sympathy

53:43.094 --> 53:46.264
has maybe let them off the hook
on too many specifics.

53:46.348 --> 53:48.308
Right? Like big tech.

53:48.391 --> 53:49.643
Middle East.

53:49.726 --> 53:50.852
Green subsidies.

53:50.936 --> 53:54.272
We'd like a branded
nightly segment, like...

53:55.190 --> 53:56.399
"Is he losing his grip?"

53:57.525 --> 53:59.444
"Is he losing his grip?"

54:01.363 --> 54:03.114
You know he's a friend, right?

54:03.198 --> 54:06.076
But with a question mark, like,
"Is he?"

54:06.159 --> 54:08.203
Oh! Oh, with a question mark!

54:08.286 --> 54:11.122
Well, thank you for giving me
discretion on the punctuation.

54:11.206 --> 54:12.999
Shiv, I have a perspective.

54:13.333 --> 54:14.459
Okay?

54:14.542 --> 54:17.253
And a reputation that I've
built up over a number of years.

54:17.337 --> 54:19.255
But this is something
my dad wants.

54:20.048 --> 54:23.259
So, one, he has a great antenna

54:23.343 --> 54:24.844
and you should
trust his hunches.

54:24.928 --> 54:26.012
But two...

54:27.180 --> 54:29.099
in a sense, this conversation
is already over.

54:29.182 --> 54:30.392
It's just a question of
how many times

54:30.475 --> 54:31.851
we scream the word
"Fuck" at each other

54:31.935 --> 54:33.311
before you do what we want.

54:35.772 --> 54:38.817
What if I go public with this
full-court press?

54:38.900 --> 54:40.652
Incredibly embarrassing for you.

54:40.735 --> 54:42.570
Yeah, but...

54:42.654 --> 54:45.991
the thing about us, Mark,
and you should know this by now,

54:46.825 --> 54:48.284
we don't get embarrassed.

54:49.828 --> 54:51.371
After me. Thanks.

54:55.333 --> 54:57.669
Hey! How're things looking?

54:57.752 --> 55:00.213
Conference call with lawyers
before they head back in.

55:00.296 --> 55:03.508
Sandy and Stewy. No progress.
It's not good.

55:03.591 --> 55:04.676
And how was the date?

55:04.759 --> 55:06.845
Did you fuck him
or tug him off between courses?

55:08.179 --> 55:09.222
Enough, okay?

55:09.305 --> 55:10.473
-GERRI: Seriously, I mean it.
-Enough. Stop it.

55:10.557 --> 55:12.017
Seriously,
stop flirting with me.

55:12.100 --> 55:13.643
What do you want?

55:14.811 --> 55:16.062
You're gonna fucking die.

55:18.273 --> 55:19.941
-GERRI: Oh, God!
-ROMAN: I know.

55:21.026 --> 55:22.694
Don't use this.

55:22.777 --> 55:26.322
No! Come on--
That is a magic bullet.

55:26.406 --> 55:27.323
He's gonna love it.

55:27.407 --> 55:28.700
Dad's gonna give me
my bedtime bath.

55:28.783 --> 55:32.203
Bank the photos. By all means.
But don't spread it around.

55:32.287 --> 55:33.788
Yeah, it's great for Logan.

55:33.872 --> 55:35.206
It's bad for Kendall.

55:35.290 --> 55:36.666
It's bad for you.

55:36.750 --> 55:38.084
"The Tattoo Brothers"?

55:39.461 --> 55:41.755
Oh, okay, so, what?
You, uh-- you care?

55:41.838 --> 55:44.340
"How does this advance
my personal position?"

55:44.424 --> 55:47.385
You need to
think about that 24/7.

55:47.469 --> 55:49.429
You should get that
tattooed on your head.

55:49.971 --> 55:51.431
Here.

55:51.514 --> 55:53.391
Keep the photos.
Our little secret.

55:56.186 --> 55:57.854
Oh, did you hear about your dad?

55:57.937 --> 55:58.938
No, what?

56:00.190 --> 56:02.233
LOGAN: Uh-huh. I'm sorry.

56:03.151 --> 56:04.819
I don't control them like that.

56:06.154 --> 56:09.032
-He has editorial freedom.
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER PHONE)

56:09.115 --> 56:11.785
Oh, come on, come on!
That's just rumors.

56:13.036 --> 56:14.079
Watch the show!

56:15.163 --> 56:16.581
I'm sure it won't seem so bad.

56:17.874 --> 56:20.418
(INDISTINCT CHATTER
OVER PHONE CONTINUES)

56:21.419 --> 56:23.129
You want to hear
what it sounds like

56:23.213 --> 56:25.090
when the President
loses his temper?

56:29.719 --> 56:30.762
(GIGGLES)

56:31.221 --> 56:32.430
(CHUCKLES)

56:33.264 --> 56:36.017
Look, let me investigate.
I--

56:36.101 --> 56:37.185
You know Mark.

56:37.268 --> 56:40.730
He's very tenacious,
very independent.

56:40.814 --> 56:42.774
I don't know,
but if I wasn't so tied up

56:42.857 --> 56:44.567
in this fucking investigation,

56:44.651 --> 56:49.072
I could focus on keeping
ATN on message. Hmm?

56:51.866 --> 56:54.410
ROMAN: Hey, I hear
you tried to kill Dad again?

56:54.494 --> 56:55.912
It was just heat exhaustion.

56:55.995 --> 56:57.372
Uh, that's not
what we're hearing.

56:57.455 --> 56:59.749
We're hearing that you took an
old man out to die in the sun.

56:59.833 --> 57:01.543
We went for a hike with Josh.

57:01.626 --> 57:04.420
You tried to assassinate
our dad with the sun.

57:04.504 --> 57:06.506
Do you have a fetish
for nearly killing Dad?

57:06.589 --> 57:08.883
Like, "Just the tip"
but for like killing Dad?

57:08.967 --> 57:10.760
Well, look, it's in hand.

57:10.844 --> 57:11.845
The vote.

57:11.928 --> 57:12.929
Josh is a lock.

57:13.012 --> 57:14.639
Uh, well, no, actually.
He's out.

57:14.722 --> 57:15.723
What are you talking about?

57:15.807 --> 57:18.184
-He's with us.
-ROMAN:<i> No! He's out.</i>

57:18.268 --> 57:19.435
Frank just got off the phone.

57:19.519 --> 57:21.563
Apparently, Dad's little
freak-out gave him the shits.

57:21.646 --> 57:23.565
<i>Weak leadership,</i>
<i>fractured at the top.</i>

57:23.648 --> 57:26.109
You let him fucking shrivel,
he saw that.

57:26.192 --> 57:27.152
And now he has, quote,

57:27.235 --> 57:29.320
"Zero faith in the
post-Dad leadership."

57:29.404 --> 57:30.488
It's not my fault
he's an old man

57:30.572 --> 57:31.739
who can't climb a fucking hill.

57:31.823 --> 57:33.324
We're about to lose the company
at the shareholder meet,

57:33.408 --> 57:37.162
all because you wouldn't give
our dad a timely fucking Evian.

57:37.245 --> 57:38.454
