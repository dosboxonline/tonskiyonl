Oh, my God, you're right.

18:50.279 --> 18:52.130
I've mucked it up again.

18:52.357 --> 18:54.190
Officers, I hope you never know
what it's like

18:54.208 --> 18:57.117
to face a lifetime
of failing at your duty.

18:57.137 --> 18:59.028
Never happen, my friend.

18:59.046 --> 19:00.638
Cuffs. Cuffs.

19:00.789 --> 19:02.974
Oh, who's got the cuffs?!

19:05.036 --> 19:06.460
I'm-I'm nothing.

19:06.554 --> 19:08.871
I'm a failure.
I'm worse than my father.

19:08.964 --> 19:12.984
I'm just a hopeless bag
of useless...

19:13.211 --> 19:16.320
Can't even kick myself.

19:16.472 --> 19:17.713
<i> Aw. Poor fella.</i>

19:17.732 --> 19:19.882
<i> Nothin' to show</i>
<i> for 50 years' work.</i>

19:19.901 --> 19:21.642
<i> But who does</i>
<i> except for Tom Jones?</i>

19:21.736 --> 19:25.145
<i> (chuckles)</i>
<i> That guy</i> loves<i> not being dead.</i>

19:25.165 --> 19:26.906
<i> But I could help this guy.</i>

19:27.000 --> 19:29.892
<i> By being the Grey Box.</i>

19:29.911 --> 19:31.744
<i> Or whatever.</i>

19:31.896 --> 19:34.230
You know what?
You got your man.

19:34.323 --> 19:36.490
I did spy for the Russkies.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.584
I am the Grey Fox!

19:38.736 --> 19:40.344
(sniffles)
R-Really?

19:40.496 --> 19:43.756
Yep. I always knew
you'd be the one to get me.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.258
Oh-ho! Good show, me!

19:46.352 --> 19:49.687
I have to admit, I did doubt
myself a couple of times.

19:49.838 --> 19:52.172
Well, now you can retire
a happy man,

19:52.266 --> 19:56.009
watch Fox News and feel
your brain turn to angry mush.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.254
Congratulations.

19:58.272 --> 19:59.438
Mm.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.867
(exhales)
Marge, may I give you a hug?

20:03.094 --> 20:04.702
Of course.

20:04.929 --> 20:05.852
(gunshot)

20:05.872 --> 20:08.355
No! It's happened again!

20:08.374 --> 20:09.540
No, no, no, she's fine.

20:09.767 --> 20:12.192
I was just shootin' off the top
of a soda can.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.619
(chuckles)
Yeah.

20:13.771 --> 20:17.273
Homer, why don't you ride back
with Terrance?

20:17.291 --> 20:18.107
Okay.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.717
No, no. Up front.

20:19.868 --> 20:21.777
Up front! Like a grown-up!
