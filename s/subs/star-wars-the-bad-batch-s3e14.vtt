WEBVTT

00:51.250 --> 00:53.375
We'll be exiting hyperspace soon.

00:53.458 --> 00:56.458
The base's scanners will detect us
once we're on approach.

00:56.541 --> 00:59.250
Then we'll detach from
the science vessel's hull before then

00:59.333 --> 01:00.583
and infiltrate on foot.

01:01.375 --> 01:02.833
The jungle is deadly.

01:02.916 --> 01:05.958
Yes, exactly. At least listen to him.

01:06.041 --> 01:08.166
Well, how is Echo gonna get off that ship?

01:08.250 --> 01:09.416
He'll find a way.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.375
[alarm beeping]

01:11.458 --> 01:12.458
Get into position.

01:30.541 --> 01:31.541
[console beeps]

01:32.750 --> 01:35.166
[footsteps approaching]

01:40.916 --> 01:41.750
[console beeps]

01:50.666 --> 01:52.875
What's the status of the science vessel?

01:52.958 --> 01:56.208
[Scorch] En route,
but we have a potential security breach.

01:56.958 --> 02:01.458
Clone Force 99 infiltrated the orbital
station with former Vice Admiral Rampart.

02:01.541 --> 02:02.875
Where are they now?

02:02.958 --> 02:06.458
[Scorch] They fled aboard a stolen shuttle
when the science vessel departed.

02:07.166 --> 02:08.416
They could be tracking it.

02:09.291 --> 02:11.625
Dispatch fighters to monitor airspace.

02:16.958 --> 02:18.958
[engine roaring]

02:23.916 --> 02:25.791
-[Hunter] Disengaging.
-[beeps]

02:32.166 --> 02:34.166
[alarm blaring]

02:34.250 --> 02:35.458
Multiple fighters inbound.

02:35.541 --> 02:37.416
[engines roaring]

02:37.500 --> 02:40.333
[Crosshair] That's not a standard
formation. They're expecting us.

02:46.791 --> 02:47.875
[alarm beeps]

02:51.000 --> 02:53.708
[Imperial technician] Our fighters
have engaged a rogue shuttle.

02:53.791 --> 02:54.958
Lock down the base.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.125
Neutralize the threat, Commander.

02:57.708 --> 02:58.958
[Scorch] Activate laser cannons.

03:08.750 --> 03:09.750
[Hunter] Hang on!

03:14.916 --> 03:17.000
[rumbling]

03:17.083 --> 03:19.083
[Bayrn coos, giggles]

03:19.166 --> 03:20.500
What is that?

03:21.125 --> 03:22.750
[rumbling continues]

03:23.958 --> 03:25.208
Laser cannons.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.583
Doctors, there is
a base-wide security alert.

03:30.916 --> 03:34.000
Follow lockdown protocols.
I'll secure the lab.

03:34.833 --> 03:37.083
Monitor the children in my absence.

03:37.166 --> 03:40.083
Your concern for the specimens
is unwarranted.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.958
[device beeping]

03:46.791 --> 03:48.250
[whispering] What's going on?

03:48.333 --> 03:49.750
They found me.

03:49.833 --> 03:50.833
Who?

03:50.916 --> 03:52.333
My brothers.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.833
[engines roaring]

03:56.916 --> 03:58.833
[explosions]

04:01.041 --> 04:02.958
[Crosshair] Deflector shields are failing.

04:07.458 --> 04:08.666
[alarm blaring]

04:18.250 --> 04:19.458
[alarm blaring]

04:24.708 --> 04:25.875
[Hunter] There's no time to land.

04:25.958 --> 04:27.833
Wrecker, prep the rappel cables.

04:27.916 --> 04:30.166
-[Wrecker] On it.
-On it? On what?

04:30.250 --> 04:32.458
[Wrecker chuckles] You don't wanna know.

04:32.541 --> 04:34.333
[Hunter] Autopilot engaged.

04:38.958 --> 04:40.750
What do you expect me to do?

04:40.833 --> 04:43.041
[Hunter] Try not to hit anything
on the way down.

04:43.125 --> 04:45.708
Whoa! You've got to be kidding!

04:45.791 --> 04:46.875
[Wrecker] Lines ready.

04:47.833 --> 04:49.333
[Wrecker laughs]

04:54.083 --> 04:56.666
[Crosshair, Wrecker grunting]

04:57.625 --> 04:59.000
[Hunter] Now!

04:59.083 --> 05:01.000
Whoa! [grunts] Wait!

05:01.875 --> 05:03.875
Wait! The cable is jammed!

05:06.791 --> 05:08.833
[screams, pants]

05:11.708 --> 05:12.833
[screams]

05:17.583 --> 05:19.000
[Imperial technician] Confirmed hit.

05:19.083 --> 05:21.500
The shuttle was shot down
and crashed in the jungle.

05:21.583 --> 05:23.416
Have patrols search the crash site.

05:24.666 --> 05:27.083
[Scorch] Sir,
our science vessel is on final approach.

05:27.166 --> 05:29.916
Have the entire ship searched
and the crew scanned.

05:30.666 --> 05:32.958
No one leaves that hangar
without authorization.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.125
[stormtroopers chattering]

05:48.916 --> 05:50.916
[engines roaring]

06:13.125 --> 06:14.208
[console beeps]

06:16.000 --> 06:18.125
[whirring]

06:19.166 --> 06:22.833
[lieutenant] Step aside.
This cargo must be off-loaded at once.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.416
[Scorch] We're here to search this vessel
and check everyone's clearance.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.833
That was already completed
at the orbital station.

06:28.916 --> 06:30.583
[Scorch] Hemlock's orders.

06:32.208 --> 06:33.291
Fine.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.000
[whirring]

06:47.291 --> 06:50.291
[engines roaring]

06:53.000 --> 06:55.833
[Wrecker groans] I don't see 'em.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.750
Should we break comm silence?

06:57.833 --> 07:00.833
[Crosshair] No.
We continue toward the base.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.250
Hunter will head that way too.

07:03.333 --> 07:06.166
[Wrecker] A-Are you sure we're headed
in the right direction?

07:06.708 --> 07:08.625
[Crosshair] I've been here before.

07:08.708 --> 07:10.708
It's not a place you forget.

07:11.625 --> 07:14.791
[Wrecker grunts]
You broke out of here once.

07:14.875 --> 07:17.208
At least this time you're breaking in.
[chuckles]

07:17.291 --> 07:19.291
[Crosshair] I'd rather not do either,

07:20.125 --> 07:23.125
but Omega didn't leave me behind
when she could have.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.750
[sighs] I owe her.

07:26.333 --> 07:28.333
-[leaves rustling]
-[footsteps approaching]

07:30.708 --> 07:33.708
See? He found us.

07:33.791 --> 07:35.500
[Wrecker] Did, uh, Rampart make it?

07:35.583 --> 07:37.750
Unfortunately, yes.

07:37.833 --> 07:40.083
[Rampart] I heard that. [pants]

07:40.166 --> 07:42.500
You three truly are defective clones.

07:42.583 --> 07:45.041
If you had any common sense,
you wouldn't have come here.

07:45.541 --> 07:47.500
You won't get out of this alive.

07:48.083 --> 07:49.708
[Hunter] We'll take our chances.

07:51.416 --> 07:52.416
Incoming.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.208
[ships approaching]

08:09.708 --> 08:13.041
[commando] We're at the crash site.
There's no one aboard.

08:13.625 --> 08:16.041
[Imperial technician]
Commence a radial sweep of the jungle.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.916
[footsteps approaching]

08:32.000 --> 08:33.583
[whirring]

08:37.375 --> 08:40.416
[droid] Wait.
You are not authorized to be here.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.750
This area is under my jurisdiction.

08:43.833 --> 08:47.583
[Echo] Ah, well, I was, uh,
checking the manifest.

08:48.375 --> 08:50.583
[droid] What is going on here?

08:50.666 --> 08:51.666
[grunts]

09:03.250 --> 09:04.500
Thanks for the hand.

09:15.458 --> 09:16.541

[datapad beeps]

09:35.875 --> 09:36.875
[datapad beeps]

09:52.583 --> 09:57.000
Why haven't our vitals been taken today,
and where did everyone go?

09:57.625 --> 10:00.041
I don't know. This is weird.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.916
I need to scout out what's going on.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.708
And this is my best chance,
before the others come back.

10:05.791 --> 10:06.625
[Bayrn coos]

10:07.208 --> 10:10.708
If something happens,
and I'm not back in time, cover me.

10:10.791 --> 10:12.208
Cover you?

10:12.291 --> 10:13.833
What does that mean?

10:13.916 --> 10:15.250
Keep watch.

10:15.333 --> 10:18.041
If the droids come snooping, stall them.

10:18.791 --> 10:19.958
How?

10:20.041 --> 10:21.625
You'll think of something.

10:24.125 --> 10:25.375
I'm counting on you.

you get left behind.

11:20.500 --> 11:23.416
You used to believe
good soldiers followed orders.

11:24.083 --> 11:26.666
[Crosshair] Depends on who's giving them.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.250
The Empire betrayed us both.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.375
And you think you can fight them?

11:34.041 --> 11:35.708
That's not you.

11:36.583 --> 11:40.666
You're like me.
Loyal to no one but yourself.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.666
[Crosshair] I've changed.

11:49.291 --> 11:50.375
Sure you have.

13:25.291 --> 13:27.625
-[Crosshair] No. It'll take too long.
-[sighs]

13:27.708 --> 13:30.500

slowing us down.

13:30.583 --> 13:32.750
-By all means, take your time.

Shoot it. Now!

14:06.125 --> 14:09.333
[Hunter] No.
Blaster fire will give away our position.

19:42.500 --> 19:44.750
Omega told us about you too.

19:44.833 --> 19:47.416
She said her squad
would eventually come for her.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.916
[Echo] Not just her.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.166
We're here for all the prisoners
you've been experimenting on.

19:53.250 --> 19:56.666
I-- I was doing my job.

19:57.250 --> 19:59.500
[Echo] Yeah, I've heard that before.

20:00.666 --> 20:01.666
You're a clone.

20:02.500 --> 20:04.166
How can you be part of this?

20:05.250 --> 20:07.083
Omega saw something in you.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.583
I want to believe that she was right.

20:10.666 --> 20:12.083
Tell me where she is.

20:13.500 --> 20:14.666
She's in the vault,

20:15.208 --> 20:18.625
but you won't get anywhere near there
without my assistance.

20:18.708 --> 20:22.958
If we're gonna free those children,
you're going to have to trust me.

20:23.041 --> 20:25.958
Wait, w-what children?

20:26.041 --> 20:29.875
Omega is not the only child
confined inside this base.

20:42.958 --> 20:44.625
[Bayrn coos]

20:44.708 --> 20:45.708
[device beeps]

20:51.125 --> 20:52.958
[sighs] That was too close.

20:53.791 --> 20:55.458
What took so long?

20:58.250 --> 21:00.416
I found something big.

21:02.791 --> 21:07.375
I have a plan,
and I'm gonna need your help.
