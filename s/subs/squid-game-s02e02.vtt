<i>If you want to meet the person</i>
<i>you mentioned earlier,</i>

00:55.972 --> 00:57.891
<i>the key is in my pocket.</i>

01:54.405 --> 01:57.659
Please don't kill me.
I'm sorry for everything. Please!

01:57.742 --> 01:59.035
Where is Seong Gi-hun?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.328
Room 410!

02:17.637 --> 02:19.597
Police. Hands above your head!

02:35.864 --> 02:37.407
Seong Gi-hun.

02:37.490 --> 02:39.784
You are under arrest
on suspicion of murder.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.870
You have the right to an attorney,

02:41.953 --> 02:43.246
and you have the right to--

02:48.877 --> 02:50.086
Who are you?

02:52.881 --> 02:56.134
Are… Are you Mr. Seong Gi-hun?

02:56.217 --> 02:59.470
I've been helping Mr. Kim
look for the man with the <i>ddakji</i>.

02:59.554 --> 03:01.181
My name is Choi Woo-seok.

03:01.264 --> 03:05.351
We've been sending you pictures
from the subway stations every day!

03:05.935 --> 03:07.270
Don't you remember?

03:09.480 --> 03:13.026
We've never met in person,

03:13.109 --> 03:15.737
but I've heard
a lot about you from my boss.

03:15.820 --> 03:20.325
He said you were a great man
who came to settle your debt voluntarily.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.911
He said he'd never seen anyone like you…

03:24.537 --> 03:25.413
That bastard.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.209
Did you kill him, Mr. Seong?

03:31.961 --> 03:34.839
You goddamn son of a bitch!

03:37.508 --> 03:39.219
That bastard…

03:40.762 --> 03:44.224
That bastard killed the boss.

03:47.685 --> 03:52.649
I played two rocks by mistake.

03:52.732 --> 03:57.570
He had paper and scissors.
All he had to do was pick paper.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.114
But he didn't.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.784
Like a fool…

OCTOBER 31 MIDNIGHT

SQUID GAME 2

04:22.470 --> 04:26.808
EPISODE 2
HALLOWEEN PARTY

04:46.828 --> 04:47.829
Excuse me!

04:49.998 --> 04:51.165
Hey!

04:51.874 --> 04:52.959
Wake up!

04:57.755 --> 04:59.215
Open the window.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.768
What are you doing here?

05:11.936 --> 05:13.855
I work here.

05:13.938 --> 05:15.523
I have to be here early tomorrow.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.526
Doesn't mean you can
sleep out here in your car.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.862
I'll get in trouble
if my superiors find out.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.906
I think I've seen you here before.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.701
I'm sorry. I'll move my car tomorrow.

05:27.201 --> 05:28.911
There won't be a next time.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.998
Otherwise, I'll have to report you.

05:32.832 --> 05:33.750
Okay.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.729
Detective Hwang Jun-ho.

05:58.149 --> 05:59.609
Now I remember.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.112
You came to see me
at my house once before.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.656
We've met twice.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.868
Once in front of your house, and again…

06:10.495 --> 06:11.662
on that island.

06:12.455 --> 06:15.375
Do you remember?
The night of the ruckus in the dorm.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.294
The masked men went in to stop it.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.590
Were you one of them?

06:22.673 --> 06:25.134
I snuck in there in disguise
to find my brother.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.220
How can I believe you?

06:27.303 --> 06:31.140
One of the masked men asked you
about someone named Hwang In-ho.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.060
<i>Player 456.</i>

06:35.019 --> 06:36.687
Is there a man named Hwang In-ho here?

06:38.898 --> 06:41.526
We do not know each other's names.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.653
<i>That was me.</i>

06:44.153 --> 06:45.947
Hwang In-ho is my brother.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.953
Who's the man you killed?

06:53.204 --> 06:56.541
He's a recruiter
who finds players for the game.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.710
But I didn't kill him.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.550
He simply lost the game.

07:07.009 --> 07:10.221
Are you still a part of that game?

07:10.805 --> 07:13.474
I'm trying to put an end to it.

07:13.558 --> 07:14.559
How?

07:14.642 --> 07:16.310
I'm going to find that guy first.

07:17.603 --> 07:20.273
The overseer of the game,
who worked for Oh Il-nam.

07:22.316 --> 07:23.651
Do you know who he is?

07:25.695 --> 07:27.697
The masked men call him Captain.

07:27.780 --> 07:28.948
Did you see his face?

07:31.242 --> 07:35.830
No, I didn't see his face.
He was wearing a black mask.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.002
How do you plan on finding him?

07:42.712 --> 07:44.881
This is the invitation he sent.

07:49.218 --> 07:52.263
If you find him, what next?

07:53.806 --> 07:54.807
Kill him?

07:55.850 --> 07:58.478
Killing him
will not put an end to the game.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.190
Before Oh Il-nam died, he said

08:03.316 --> 08:06.360
he created the game for his clients.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.403
That's right.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.364
There are people they call the VIPs.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.241
I saw one of them.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.119
Let me go.

08:16.120 --> 08:17.705
I'll help you find them.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.375
Mr. Seong. You can't trust cops.

08:21.959 --> 08:25.671
I've never seen cops
helping people like us.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.888
I'm sorry about your brother.
But you should forget about it.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.556
Can you forget?

08:37.391 --> 08:39.143
The people who died on that island?

08:41.187 --> 08:43.731
I saw things that you didn't.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.150
I can help you…

08:48.444 --> 08:49.987
with what you're trying to do.

08:58.412 --> 09:00.831
Please reconsider, Mr. Seong.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.876
I once got scammed and lost all my money.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.379
I was furious,
so I roughed him up a little.

09:06.462 --> 09:08.172
It wasn't even that bad,

09:08.256 --> 09:11.717
but the cops only arrested me
and told me to settle with him.

09:11.801 --> 09:13.219
But with what money?

09:13.302 --> 09:15.680
That asshole took everything.

09:15.763 --> 09:19.684
You know what's crazy?
I went to prison, and he got away with it.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.811
Since then, I've never trusted cops…

09:26.023 --> 09:27.400
The money…

09:27.483 --> 09:28.901
Mr. Seong.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.821
So it's true that you won the game?

09:39.120 --> 09:43.249
It's blood money
for all those people who died there.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.130
I'm going to use it
to fight those bastards.

09:50.881 --> 09:55.094
If you help me,
I'll give you as much as you want.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.805
I'm not doing this for money.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.391
Me neither.

10:01.183 --> 10:04.061
That bastard killed my boss
right in front of me.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.481
He was like a brother to me.
He even officiated my wedding.

10:08.816 --> 10:11.319
I'm going to find the fat cats,
tie them up,

10:11.402 --> 10:13.779
make them play Rock, Paper, Scissors
and shoot them dead.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.408
They have armed forces on that island.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.077
We can't fight them with a few pistols.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.542
These are what I've collected so far.

10:30.004 --> 10:33.215
Are they real?
Where did you get all these?

10:33.299 --> 10:38.220
Man, Mr. Seong. So you've got a plan!

10:38.304 --> 10:40.973
I want you to gather people
we can join forces with.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.892
Sure, don't worry.

10:42.975 --> 10:45.645
I know some men
who are good at that stuff.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.564
These are K2s, aren't they?

10:48.648 --> 10:51.400
I haven't seen one
since I was in the military.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.029
I'm guessing they're black market.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.531
Do they even work?

11:25.601 --> 11:28.354
Come and practice whenever you can.

11:29.647 --> 11:30.564
Also,

11:31.816 --> 11:34.860
I suggest that you quit your current job.

12:30.791 --> 12:34.086
God, it's hot. Turn up the AC!

12:34.170 --> 12:38.007
Man, why is the AC here so weak? Damn it.

12:39.925 --> 12:42.762
- Can somebody ask to get it fixed?
- The weather is insane.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.390
- I want to go home.
- What are you doing after work?

12:46.932 --> 12:48.392
- Want to grab a beer?
- Sounds good.

12:48.476 --> 12:51.729
- I'm in.
- A new place opened nearby.

12:51.812 --> 12:54.982
- I'm exhausted.
- That was rough.

13:13.292 --> 13:17.338
Bunny, this is for you.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.982
Bunny, does it hurt here?

13:39.318 --> 13:41.445
It's too hot for this, man.

13:42.613 --> 13:46.826
I can't breathe in this fucking pig head.
Is it just me?

13:57.378 --> 13:58.462
Na-yeon!

14:00.005 --> 14:00.965
Na-yeon.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.591
Na-yeon.

14:04.301 --> 14:07.179
Na-yeon.
I told you not to go into random places.

14:07.263 --> 14:10.224
Daddy!

14:11.225 --> 14:14.645
Don't cry. I'm sorry, guys.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.648
You're okay. Daddy is here.

14:24.071 --> 14:26.323
When did she get out of the hospital?

14:27.700 --> 14:28.576
Who is she?

14:29.910 --> 14:33.956
You know the artists
who draw people's portraits in the park?

14:34.039 --> 14:37.042
That guy is one of them,
and she's his daughter.

14:37.918 --> 14:39.211
Is she sick?

14:40.671 --> 14:42.882
Well, I hear she has blood cancer.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.426
Apparently, she needs
a bone marrow transplant,

14:45.968 --> 14:47.553
but it's not easy to get one.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.184
SANG-WOO'S FISH STORE

14:54.268 --> 14:57.479
- Take care.
- Thank you. Bye.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.155
Cheol!

15:06.697 --> 15:07.615
Grandma.

15:13.078 --> 15:14.580
- Have you had dinner?
- Yes.

15:14.663 --> 15:16.582
I had a burger with my friends.

15:17.333 --> 15:21.211
That's not enough.
I steamed some sweet potatoes.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.422
Sweet potatoes? But I'm full.

15:23.505 --> 15:24.882
Drink some <i>sikhye </i>then.

15:28.344 --> 15:32.389
The woman next to Sae-byeok is her mom.

15:32.473 --> 15:37.519
She was recently released from
a prison camp in North Hamgyong Province.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.397
How is she doing?

15:40.481 --> 15:43.233
There was a tuberculosis outbreak
in her prison,

15:43.317 --> 15:45.527
but she never received proper treatment.

15:45.611 --> 15:48.238
She won't be able to move for a while.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.200
Please just get her here
as soon as possible.

15:51.283 --> 15:56.288
I've got the best experts ready
in China and North Korea.

15:56.872 --> 16:00.334
As soon as she recovers,
we'll get her moving.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.504
I can give you more money
if that's what you need.

16:03.587 --> 16:05.172
No.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.299
You've already given me enough money.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.265
After last time, I owe it to Sae-byeok.

16:15.849 --> 16:19.687
I'm going to make this happen.

16:29.822 --> 16:30.656
What's this?

16:30.739 --> 16:31.657
SANG-WOO'S FISH STORE

16:31.740 --> 16:34.493
That's where
Sae-byeok's little brother is.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.287
If you can't get in touch with me,

16:38.497 --> 16:40.916
please contact this number.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.003
All right, I will.

17:02.896 --> 17:06.025
Oh, for God's sake. You again?

17:09.069 --> 17:12.740
Why do you keep bothering me like this?
I told you to find another broker.

17:13.323 --> 17:17.036
Everyone else says she's dead.

17:17.119 --> 17:19.580
Then she must be dead.

17:19.663 --> 17:22.708
Do you think I can magically
bring people back to life?

17:22.791 --> 17:25.461
You said she might be alive.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.713
No, what I meant was

17:27.796 --> 17:31.967
no one has actually witnessed her death
or found her body.

17:32.051 --> 17:34.720
I wasn't saying that she's alive.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.847
No one has seen her alive either.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.187
Please look for her one last time.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.856
Why is everyone offering me money?

17:47.357 --> 17:49.651
I knew being kind has its rewards.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.904
Please give it another try.

17:51.987 --> 17:54.198
If this isn't enough,
I'll bring you more money.

17:57.576 --> 18:01.038
If this was about money,
I would've asked for it a long time ago.

18:01.622 --> 18:05.709
No-eul, you know
how hard I've tried to find her.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.379
I felt bad for you
because I'm a father myself.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.465
- I really did my best.
- I hear you.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.760
Please, one last time.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.472
Let me be honest with you.

18:18.555 --> 18:21.058
How do you expect a one-year-old

18:21.141 --> 18:24.144
to survive in North Korea
without her parents?

18:24.228 --> 18:27.481
Besides, her mother shot her superior

18:27.564 --> 18:30.192
and defected
to South Korea like a traitor…

18:36.323 --> 18:39.368
I'm not saying it was your fault, No-eul.

18:39.868 --> 18:43.038
That's just what happened.

18:46.834 --> 18:50.838
I know it's harsh to tell a mother
to forget about her child,

18:52.714 --> 18:54.133
but you really should.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.177
There's nothing else you can do.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.428
I'm sorry. I'll move my car right away.

19:40.053 --> 19:41.305
Ms. Kang No-eul.

20:18.675 --> 20:19.509
Hi, Mother.

20:19.593 --> 20:22.471
<i>Where are you? Are you there yet?</i>

20:23.680 --> 20:24.973
I'm walking up there now.

20:25.057 --> 20:30.062
<i>Jun-ho. Take a look and see</i>
<i>if your brother has visited.</i>

20:30.562 --> 20:36.944
<i>If he's alive, he would've left flowers</i>
<i>on the anniversary of his wife's death.</i>

20:58.131 --> 20:59.383
Did he come by?

21:00.008 --> 21:00.842
No.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.473
I suppose your brother

21:08.225 --> 21:11.770
doesn't want us in his life anymore.

21:13.897 --> 21:17.109
We haven't heard from him in years now.

21:17.192 --> 21:19.945
It's probably because

21:21.071 --> 21:23.615
he still resents me deep down.

21:25.617 --> 21:29.454
We were also struggling back then,
and he knows that.

21:29.538 --> 21:32.291
I just don't want him to think

21:32.374 --> 21:36.837
that I favored you over him
because he's my stepson.

21:38.338 --> 21:40.424
That's what I'm afraid of.

21:40.507 --> 21:42.301
Please stop thinking that.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.512
He knows that's not true.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.682
Your brother…

21:50.017 --> 21:53.603
He saved your life
by giving you one of his kidneys.

21:54.521 --> 21:59.026
But when his wife got sick,

22:00.485 --> 22:02.571
I couldn't do anything for her.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.200
If I could have…

22:11.163 --> 22:16.126
I would've sold my organs to help her.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.920
If that were the issue,
he'd resent me instead.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.133
If he hadn't given me his kidney,

22:23.216 --> 22:26.219
he could've sold it
and gotten her the treatment she needed.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.765
If I had just died--

22:29.848 --> 22:31.058
Don't say such a thing.

22:31.141 --> 22:32.809
Neither should you!

22:33.643 --> 22:35.228
Stop saying these things!

22:36.938 --> 22:39.775
Fate gave her that disease,

22:40.859 --> 22:43.695
and it was In-ho's own decision
to take bribes.

22:44.905 --> 22:48.200
You and I are not responsible
for what happened to him!

22:50.452 --> 22:53.205
He simply paid for what he had done.

23:37.374 --> 23:38.375
I'm sorry.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.292
RESIGNATION LETTER

23:39.376 --> 23:40.794
It's for personal reasons.

23:40.877 --> 23:43.880
Still, you can't quit so suddenly.

23:45.132 --> 23:46.800
It'll be hard to find a replacement.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.135
I'm sorry.

23:48.218 --> 23:50.637
No-eul, how did you work in this thing?

23:50.720 --> 23:54.599
Damn, it's even worse
than the stupid pig head.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.311
Sir, this must be why No-eul is quitting.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.897
Kids might be happy
seeing us in these things,

24:00.981 --> 24:03.650
but it totally sucks
for the adults wearing them.

24:03.733 --> 24:04.901
Isn't that right, No-eul?

24:04.985 --> 24:09.573
We're having dinner together tonight.
You should come and say goodbye.

24:09.656 --> 24:11.783
That's right.
You should join us for dinner.

24:11.867 --> 24:15.454
And have a drink.
Everyone will be sad if you don't.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.913
Thank you for everything.

24:23.795 --> 24:27.174
Man, she's cold.
Right up until her last day.

24:27.257 --> 24:31.094
I've worked with her for over two years,

24:31.178 --> 24:33.513
but we've never even had
a real conversation.

24:33.597 --> 24:37.726
I know. I don't know how she worked
this job with that kind of personality.

25:05.712 --> 25:06.713
Here.

25:06.796 --> 25:08.381
- What happened?
- I found her unconscious.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.508
Na-yeon.

25:12.469 --> 25:13.386
Na-yeon!

25:16.806 --> 25:17.641
Are you with her?

25:17.724 --> 25:18.767
Yes, I'm her father.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.936
Please take her to
Seohyeon University Hospital.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.956
All right. Open up for me.

26:51.610 --> 26:53.612
SEOHYEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

27:04.998 --> 27:05.999
PARK NA-YEON

27:06.082 --> 27:08.418
There's a new medication
that's just come out.

27:09.127 --> 27:14.924
It's for patients like Na-yeon
with recurrent cancer or a poor prognosis.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.844
But it's not covered
by insurance at this point.

27:17.927 --> 27:21.222
Doctor, I'll get the money somehow.

27:22.098 --> 27:24.768
Please help Na-yeon.

27:24.851 --> 27:29.356
Make an appointment for tomorrow.
I'll explain the details then.

27:29.439 --> 27:30.774
To run tests…

28:41.720 --> 28:43.888
These guys were in the Marine Corps.

28:44.764 --> 28:47.142
These guys were in UDT.

28:47.225 --> 28:50.437
And these guys were
in the ROK Special Forces.

28:50.520 --> 28:53.314
Oh, and this guy is just a former cop.

28:53.398 --> 28:55.191
As you can see,

28:55.275 --> 28:57.861
they're tough men
who'd go through hell or high water

28:57.944 --> 28:59.696
as long as the pay is right.

28:59.779 --> 29:02.157
Right. This is the leader of the team.

29:02.240 --> 29:05.160
He's a seasoned veteran
who has seen a lot of combat overseas.

29:05.744 --> 29:06.911
Please call me Kim.

29:06.995 --> 29:08.788
You must be careful tomorrow.

29:08.872 --> 29:12.250
If they notice you,
it could ruin everything.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.502
Don't worry.

29:14.586 --> 29:17.046
Only you and I will go into the club.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.549
These guys will be on standby nearby.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.468
Will they even let you in?

29:21.551 --> 29:24.179
Come on, I've already got
the perfect clubbing outfit.

29:24.262 --> 29:26.222
I clean up well.

29:26.306 --> 29:27.474
I'll go in with you.

29:27.557 --> 29:28.683
No.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.562
Your face was exposed on the island.
They might recognize you.

29:34.522 --> 29:38.693
Don't make a move
until I give you the signal.

29:38.777 --> 29:39.778
Understood.

29:43.072 --> 29:46.159
And if something happens to me tomorrow--

29:46.242 --> 29:48.411
Nothing is going to happen.

29:49.037 --> 29:51.456
You've got your tracker.

29:51.539 --> 29:55.710
Wherever you're taken,
we'll be right behind you.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.670
So you can relax. Don't worry!

30:37.752 --> 30:38.753
<i>Dad?</i>

30:41.881 --> 30:43.258
<i>Dad, is that you?</i>

30:47.595 --> 30:49.472
<i>Ga-yeong, who's that?</i>

30:49.556 --> 30:52.308
<i>I don't know. No one's saying anything.</i>

30:53.101 --> 30:54.853
<i>It must be a prank call.</i>

30:54.936 --> 30:57.480
<i>Hang up and come eat</i>
<i>before your soup gets cold.</i>

30:58.982 --> 30:59.816
<i>All right.</i>

31:16.541 --> 31:21.588
<i>If you wish to participate,</i>
<i>please state your name and birthdate.</i>

31:21.671 --> 31:23.798
June 25, 1994.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.009
Kang No-eul.

31:28.511 --> 31:30.179
<i>Confirmed.</i>

31:30.263 --> 31:33.933
<i>Here are the details</i>
<i>for your arranged pickup.</i>

31:34.017 --> 31:36.978
<i>October 31, 2024,</i>

31:37.061 --> 31:41.482
<i>at Tancheon parking lot</i>
<i>under Bongeun Bridge in Songpa-gu, Seoul.</i>

32:04.464 --> 32:05.465
Hey!

32:08.009 --> 32:11.971
Wow, look at all these people.
What is going on today?

32:12.055 --> 32:12.931
OCTOBER 31 MIDNIGHT
CLUB HDH

32:13.014 --> 32:16.517
Wait, is it today?
Hall… What's it called again?

32:16.601 --> 32:18.728
October 31, Halloween.

32:18.811 --> 32:20.229
Yes, Halloween.

32:20.313 --> 32:24.108
I'm getting a bad feeling.
This may be some kind of ruse.

32:24.192 --> 32:25.944
That guy they call the Front Man.

32:27.570 --> 32:30.365
You said he wears a gray hood
and a black mask, right?

32:30.448 --> 32:31.574
Yes.

32:32.659 --> 32:37.246
Oh, that must be why he chose today.
To cover his face.

32:37.830 --> 32:40.375
That bastard is trying to be clever. Damn.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.632
- Let's go.
- Okay.

32:51.761 --> 32:55.098
Hold on!
Let me put something over my face.

32:56.057 --> 32:58.184
I'll take this. How much?

33:16.285 --> 33:18.538
We just got in! Can you hear me?
We're underground.

33:18.621 --> 33:19.664
<i>Yes, I can hear you.</i>

33:19.747 --> 33:21.124
And the tracker?

33:22.583 --> 33:24.377
Working fine. What's your status?

33:24.460 --> 33:26.462
<i>It's totally crazy down here!</i>

33:26.546 --> 33:30.008
Everyone is wearing masks,
and I can't tell who's who!

33:30.091 --> 33:33.011
Anyway, I'll let you know
if something happens.

33:33.094 --> 33:34.053
<i>All right.</i>

34:09.547 --> 34:12.925
The masked men are here.
They're going inside.

34:13.509 --> 34:17.805
The masked men?
Hey, everyone here is wearing a mask!

34:18.556 --> 34:20.641
The men in pink jumpsuits from the island!

34:22.185 --> 34:23.436
Really?

34:35.406 --> 34:37.658
What? Do I know you?

34:38.284 --> 34:39.452
What the fuck?

34:42.955 --> 34:46.375
Hey, no cutting.
Go to the back of the line.

34:46.459 --> 34:47.293
Police. Move.

34:49.629 --> 34:51.547
See your fellow officers waiting in line?

34:53.091 --> 34:55.593
It's Halloween.
Go put on your uniform first.

34:58.137 --> 34:59.680
Does this look like a toy?

35:04.185 --> 35:05.895
I don't see any pink jumpsuits!

35:21.327 --> 35:22.370
What?

35:25.248 --> 35:28.543
I just spotted one!
He's taking Mr. Seong somewhere!

35:28.626 --> 35:29.877
I'll follow them!

35:29.961 --> 35:32.296
- <i>There were two of them.</i>
- What? What did you say?

35:32.380 --> 35:34.006
<i>- There were two of them!</i>
- What?

35:42.140 --> 35:43.307
Mr. Choi, where are you?

35:44.684 --> 35:45.768
Mr. Choi!

36:08.499 --> 36:10.001
Mr. Choi!

36:16.174 --> 36:18.134
They left the club. Get ready!

36:19.218 --> 36:21.304
Guys, it's time to roll.

36:21.387 --> 36:22.346
Get ready.

36:53.211 --> 36:56.339
He just got into a white limo.
All teams, tail them.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.883
<i>We have to catch him. Keep that in mind.</i>

36:58.966 --> 36:59.842
Go.

37:10.853 --> 37:11.979
<i>Player 456.</i>

37:13.022 --> 37:14.607
<i>Do you remember?</i>

37:14.690 --> 37:17.443
<i>We once spoke in this car.</i>

37:20.029 --> 37:21.530
Was it this car?

37:24.116 --> 37:26.285
It's nicer than I remember.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.788
<i>I sincerely hoped you'd have a good life.</i>

37:29.288 --> 37:33.125
<i>I hoped you'd forget everything</i>
<i>that happened and be happy.</i>

37:33.209 --> 37:35.753
I didn't know you cared so much about me.

37:38.422 --> 37:40.675
I'm almost moved to tears.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.302
<i>You should have gotten on that plane.</i>

37:43.386 --> 37:46.555
<i>That's the best choice</i>
<i>you could have made.</i>

37:46.639 --> 37:48.724
I have never forgotten…

37:50.601 --> 37:52.770
what you said to me then.

37:54.897 --> 37:58.025
That's why I wanted
to see you again so badly.

37:58.109 --> 38:01.862
<i>Now that we're here,</i>
<i>say what you want to say.</i>

38:02.738 --> 38:04.156
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

38:09.287 --> 38:11.038
Stop the game.

38:17.795 --> 38:18.963
<i>The game?</i>

38:19.046 --> 38:20.673
The game you've been playing.

38:21.257 --> 38:24.302
The game
that's still going on to this day.

38:24.385 --> 38:26.304
<i>All we did was create it.</i>

38:26.387 --> 38:29.015
<i>All of you participated by choice.</i>

38:29.098 --> 38:30.891
Don't give me that shit.

38:30.975 --> 38:34.854
You manipulate people
who feel like they're at a dead end.

38:35.563 --> 38:38.441
You drive them to their deaths
and enjoy it.

38:39.942 --> 38:42.486
You think if you just call it
their own choice,

38:43.195 --> 38:47.908
your filthy game will become
some sort of charity event?

38:48.492 --> 38:51.412
<i>They were all just losers of the game.</i>

38:52.246 --> 38:54.415
<i>Trash eliminated from the competition.</i>

38:55.124 --> 38:59.170
<i>A ton of new trash is being poured</i>
<i>into the world as we speak.</i>

39:00.421 --> 39:01.881
<i>You still don't see, do you?</i>

39:02.590 --> 39:06.052
<i>The game will not end</i>
<i>unless the world changes.</i>

39:06.135 --> 39:08.012
<i>Do you have the limo in sight?</i>

39:08.095 --> 39:09.513
Yes, we see it.

39:09.597 --> 39:12.850
It's on Seogang Bridge,
headed toward Yeouido. What now?

39:12.933 --> 39:15.978
Don't do anything yet.
It has to be somewhere less crowded.

39:16.062 --> 39:16.937
<i>Understood.</i>

39:20.900 --> 39:26.447
"That's just how the world is,
so just shut up and accept it"?

39:27.907 --> 39:31.077
That's a story created by people like you.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.748
You think people are just
horses in a race,

39:35.831 --> 39:38.709
and you own the horses.

39:41.295 --> 39:43.255
<i>Your way with words has improved.</i>

39:45.174 --> 39:48.386
<i>So? Is your plan to convince</i>
<i>the owners of the horses?</i>

39:49.136 --> 39:50.846
<i>To stop the race?</i>

39:52.014 --> 39:53.724
We're on it now.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.893
But the limo's movements seem suspicious.

39:55.976 --> 39:57.103
<i>How so?</i>

39:57.186 --> 39:59.313
<i>It's circling the Yeouido area.</i>

39:59.397 --> 40:02.525
<i>They might have caught on already.</i>
<i>Stop the limo now!</i>

40:03.234 --> 40:04.985
<i>Roger. Initiating the plan.</i>

40:12.618 --> 40:13.452
Shit!

40:14.578 --> 40:15.788
What the hell?

40:15.871 --> 40:17.039
What's going on?

40:17.123 --> 40:18.416
One of the tires blew out.

40:18.499 --> 40:20.709
Shit. Team Two will follow them.

40:20.793 --> 40:23.337
<i>- Okay. Back the car up now!</i>
<i>- Back up.</i>

40:27.758 --> 40:29.510
There's a sniper. Get down!

40:30.845 --> 40:34.723
<i>Both teams are under attack.</i>
<i>We have to abort the operation.</i>

40:34.807 --> 40:38.519
<i>Or were you going to kidnap me?</i>

40:39.437 --> 40:40.896
I'll follow them.

40:50.197 --> 40:51.240
They got me.

40:51.323 --> 40:52.616
<i>I'm losing them.</i>

40:54.368 --> 40:55.411
Stop the car.

40:59.999 --> 41:04.170
<i>Do you think you can stop the game</i>
<i>with a pistol?</i>

41:23.397 --> 41:24.899
Put me in the game.

41:25.399 --> 41:26.984
<i>You want to be in the game?</i>

41:29.028 --> 41:30.821
Put me back in the game.

41:30.905 --> 41:34.617
<i>Weren't you telling me</i>
<i>to stop the game just a second ago?</i>

41:34.700 --> 41:37.411
If I'm back in the game,

41:38.537 --> 41:40.831
those fat cats you serve

41:41.749 --> 41:43.876
will find it fun for sure.

41:45.920 --> 41:47.046
So,

41:48.255 --> 41:50.090
<i>take me to the games.</i>

41:54.803 --> 41:56.597
What are you hesitating for?

41:58.015 --> 41:59.475
Are you scared?

42:01.268 --> 42:03.604
That you might lose to me
like Oh Il-nam did?

42:05.272 --> 42:08.859
Oh Il-nam didn't want to admit it
until the moment he died.

42:10.236 --> 42:12.863
He knew someone had come
to help that homeless man,

42:12.947 --> 42:14.782
but he refused to look out the window.

42:15.449 --> 42:16.450
But

42:17.701 --> 42:22.831
when he stopped breathing,
I'm sure he knew

42:24.667 --> 42:26.585
that he had lost.

42:28.254 --> 42:30.172
<i>Have you seen </i>The Matrix<i>?</i>

42:30.839 --> 42:33.717
<i>They could've lived in peace</i>
<i>if they took the blue pill.</i>

42:33.801 --> 42:38.055
