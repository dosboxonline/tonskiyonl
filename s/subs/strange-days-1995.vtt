Fuck you!

- Go, man! Just go!

03:29.052 --> 03:31.555
Shit!

03:31.596 --> 03:33.056
Go!

04:16.683 --> 04:19.185
God damn it!
You know I don't deal in snuff!

04:19.226 --> 04:21.646
Don't have a fucking coronary, man.

04:21.688 --> 04:25.859
I hate the zap when they die.
It just brings down your whole day.

04:25.901 --> 04:28.111
- Jesus, Tick.
- Sorry

04:28.153 --> 04:31.031
How come the cops didn't put
that tape into evidence?

04:31.072 --> 04:34.242
With all the blood,
they didn't see the rig.

04:34.284 --> 04:38.079
- How'd it get to you?
- I got ways, Lenny.

04:38.121 --> 04:42.375
Some of the paramedics - my guy pages
me and I picked it up at the morgue.

04:42.417 --> 04:46.171
What do you think? This clip's
got to be worth a grand, right?

04:46.212 --> 04:51.009
Tick, not to dash your hopes, but
I don't deal this kind of product.

04:51.051 --> 04:55.096
I'll give you four. I gotta cut the
last part. My customers want uncut.

04:55.138 --> 04:57.474
Fuck that. The last part's the best.

Dry dive six stories and blammo!
Jacked into the big black.

05:00.852 --> 05:03.230

It's policy. I got ethics here.

05:05.774 --> 05:10.028
Oh, yeah? When did that start?
Lenny, this is what people wanna see.

05:10.070 --> 05:12.864
- So lay it off to somebody else.
- Lenny, Lenny...

05:12.906 --> 05:16.284
I gotta get my rig fixed,
there's blood all over the heads.

05:16.326 --> 05:19.537
- Get away.
- Gimme six, it's a good clip.

05:19.579 --> 05:21.665
It gets you pumpin'.

05:21.706 --> 05:23.792
The first part's OK.

05:23.833 --> 05:26.169
It's better than your usual soaps.

05:26.211 --> 05:29.130
Now, that is cold.
I always bring you choice.

05:29.172 --> 05:33.552
Sure, like this low-grade shit here?
Some girl fighting her boyfriend.

05:33.593 --> 05:35.679
Nothing happens. I'm snoring.

05:35.720 --> 05:37.931
Lenny, you're always telling me,

05:37.973 --> 05:40.141
bring you street life, real life,

05:40.183 --> 05:44.563
that one man's desperate existence
is another man's Technicolor.

05:44.604 --> 05:47.691
- I said that?
- Many times. That's a direct quote.

05:47.732 --> 05:50.485
I'll take it for five.
You'll make out OK.

05:50.527 --> 05:53.530
It's pure cream.
No cutback to the wearer.

05:53.572 --> 05:57.617
- Yeah, that's for sure. OK.
- What else you got?

He's trying to be original.

Much slower, like you're making love
with your eyes, OK?

You'll pay me $200 to put on a
hairnet and bang some beautiful babe?

five, six feet away max,

in your jacket, by the bed,
wherever you're gonna close escrow.

09:38.338 --> 09:40.423
- Know what I mean?
- Yeah, right.

09:40.465 --> 09:44.553
You got a half-hour of tape so give
me some lead-in, but not too long.

- I ain't going out for popcorn.
- Don't worry.

- No problem.

'The body of an unidentified woman

18:59.441 --> 19:02.152
'was found with them,
also shot numerous times.

19:02.193 --> 19:05.113
'Police said the killings
appear to be gang-related.

19:05.155 --> 19:07.657
'With his band, Prophets of Light,

'Jeriko One's politics and lyrics

'Meanwhile,
astrologers have been busy

'making predictions

'By 2025, there will be
a second woman president...'

19:39.814 --> 19:44.027
Hey, Lenny...
How you doin', man?

19:46.780 --> 19:48.156
Keith.

19:49.741 --> 19:51.743
- Keith?
- Yeah.

19:51.785 --> 19:55.247
Lenny. Lenny Nero.
We spoke on the phone.

19:55.288 --> 19:57.374
OK...

20:01.503 --> 20:05.257
Not to be rude, Keith,
but I got to ask. Are you a cop?

20:05.298 --> 20:07.551
I understand. No, I'm not.

20:07.592 --> 20:10.720
You understand. Attorney, right?
Attorney?

20:10.762 --> 20:13.181
- Right?
- That's right.

20:13.223 --> 20:16.893
Tassel shoes! Entertainment law
would be my guess.

20:16.935 --> 20:21.898
It's my job to know people and what
they want, what's behind their eyes.

20:21.940 --> 20:25.694
OK, so tell me, have you...
have you ever jacked in?

20:25.735 --> 20:27.946
Have you ever wire-tripped?

20:27.988 --> 20:30.740
Uh, no. No.

20:30.782 --> 20:34.202
A virgin brain? Good.
Well, we'll start you off right.

20:34.244 --> 20:37.205
Save us some time.
Tell me what you know.

20:37.247 --> 20:41.501
Just what I've read, that the
technology was developed for the Feds

20:41.543 --> 20:43.628
to replace the body wire,

20:43.670 --> 20:46.506
and now it's gone black market.

20:46.548 --> 20:48.633
That's right, so...

20:48.675 --> 20:51.136
This conversation's
not taking place, OK?

20:51.177 --> 20:53.722
- You're damn right.
- Good, good.

20:53.763 --> 20:56.766
So do I get the deck from you?

20:56.808 --> 20:59.561
I'll get one at cost.
My thing's the software.

20:59.603 --> 21:03.440
- Clips, right?
- Clips. Right.

21:03.481 --> 21:08.153
Listen, I want you to know
what we're talking about here, OK?

21:08.194 --> 21:11.364
This is not "like TV only better."

21:11.406 --> 21:13.909
This is life.

21:13.950 --> 21:16.620
It's a piece of somebody's life.

21:16.661 --> 21:18.705
It's pure and uncut,

21:18.747 --> 21:20.832
straight from the cerebral cortex.

21:20.874 --> 21:25.045
You're there. You're doing it.
You're seeing it. You're hearing it.

21:25.086 --> 21:27.172
You're feeling it.

21:27.214 --> 21:30.717
What kind of things... exactly?

21:30.759 --> 21:33.220
Exactly anything.
Whatever you want, OK?

21:33.261 --> 21:36.556
Want to go skiing without
leaving your den, you can,

21:36.598 --> 21:41.186
but I'm assuming a guy like you, you
wanna go skiing, you'd fly to Aspen.

21:41.228 --> 21:44.689
That's not what
you're interested in. It's, uh...

21:46.191 --> 21:50.362
It's about the stuff that you can't
have, right? The forbidden fruit.

21:51.905 --> 21:54.824
Like running into a liquor store
with a.357 Magnum,

21:54.866 --> 21:58.954
feeling the adrenaline
pumping through your veins, huh?

21:58.995 --> 22:02.499
Or... see that guy with the drop-dead
Filipino girlfriend?

22:02.540 --> 22:07.879
Wouldn't you like to be that guy
for 20 minutes, the right 20 minutes?

22:07.921 --> 22:09.339
Yeah.

22:09.381 --> 22:12.926
I can make it happen and you won't
even tarnish your wedding ring.

22:15.679 --> 22:19.849
- Sounds good.
- See, I can get you what you want.

22:19.891 --> 22:22.477
I can get you anything.
Just talk to me.

22:22.519 --> 22:25.564
You have to trust me,
cos I'm your priest.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.691
I'm... I'm your shrink.

22:27.732 --> 22:31.903
I am your main connection to the,
uh... switchboard of souls.

22:34.114 --> 22:38.368
I'm the magic man.
Santa Claus of the subconscious.

22:38.410 --> 22:41.746
You say it, you think it,
you can have it.

22:44.124 --> 22:47.252
You want a girl?
You want two girls?

22:48.336 --> 22:52.048
I don't know what your thing is,
what you're curious about.

22:52.090 --> 22:54.384
You want a guy?

22:55.010 --> 22:57.846
Maybe you want to be a girl. Hey...

22:57.888 --> 23:00.015
Think of that. Be a girl.

23:00.056 --> 23:04.060
See what that feels like.
Maybe you want a nun to tie you up.

23:04.102 --> 23:06.187
It's all doable.

23:06.730 --> 23:08.815
Talk to me about costs.

23:08.857 --> 23:13.528
Before we get to numbers, I want you
to try a taste. I got a deck with me.

23:13.570 --> 23:16.656
- Right here?
- Step into my office.

23:19.451 --> 23:20.827
Ohh.

23:34.507 --> 23:36.593
Mmm.

23:44.643 --> 23:46.102
Ooh.

23:52.984 --> 23:56.863
You were just an 18-year-old girl
taking a shower.

23:56.905 --> 24:00.158
You're beginning to see
the possibilities here?

24:40.907 --> 24:43.868
Hey. So, where is he?

24:43.910 --> 24:46.830
He's in the back, making a deal.

24:47.163 --> 24:49.457
Next time, let's meet
someplace private.

24:49.499 --> 24:52.210
Cops have more to worry about
than the squid trade.

24:52.252 --> 24:56.798
Oh, yeah? Assume the position,
you miserable techno-perv puke.

24:56.840 --> 24:59.134
Beat it, fuckwad!

24:59.175 --> 25:02.429
Max, I was with a client.
You think that's funny?

25:02.470 --> 25:04.347
Prick.

25:04.389 --> 25:08.435
See that preppy puke's face?
Pissed all over his topsiders!

25:08.476 --> 25:11.271
OK, it was funny,
but it could cost me money.

25:11.313 --> 25:15.609
Come on, amigo. No one knows
how to work them like you do.

25:15.650 --> 25:19.321
You could sell a rat's asshole
for a wedding ring.

25:19.362 --> 25:20.864
I could.

25:20.906 --> 25:24.910
- Let me buy you a drink. Bobby!
- Bobby!

25:24.951 --> 25:26.620
Bobby!

25:26.661 --> 25:30.832
Tequila, por favor. Double shots.
Make it a Tres Generaciones.

25:30.874 --> 25:32.959
Nothing but the best for Lenny,

25:33.001 --> 25:36.004
the finest cop to ever get
thrown off the vice squad.

25:36.046 --> 25:38.465
Fuck you.

25:39.507 --> 25:42.469
Yeah. Nice tie.

25:42.510 --> 25:46.056
- Thanks, Max.
- You dress like a fucking pimp.

25:46.097 --> 25:49.434
- It cost more than your wardrobe.
- That's not saying much.

25:49.476 --> 25:52.604
It's the one thing that stands
between me and the jungle.

25:52.646 --> 25:58.068
The jungle, where some bird can cap
you in the head and ruin your day.

25:58.109 --> 26:01.363
- You were lucky, Max.
- So darn lucky...

26:01.404 --> 26:07.494
I wake up with a.22 in my brain and
a cop pension I can't live off of.

26:07.535 --> 26:10.664
Damn! It's a good thing
I wasn't luckier.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.792
Bobby, hit me again.

26:13.833 --> 26:16.586
- You seen Faith lately?
- No, she won't call me.

26:16.628 --> 26:18.505
It's just as well.

26:18.547 --> 26:23.677
Sure, Faith was the best woman you
could ever hope to get, and it's...

26:23.718 --> 26:27.764
humiliating that she's gone,
but you got to face that it's over.

26:27.806 --> 26:31.351
Thanks, chaplain.
I'm touched by your concern.

26:31.393 --> 26:34.062
I just hate to see you pining away.

26:34.104 --> 26:37.107
You're my friend.
It makes me want to vomit.

26:39.734 --> 26:43.363
- Hey, Iris. You OK?
- I got to talk to you.

26:43.405 --> 26:46.241
What happened?
Some john get rough on you?

26:46.283 --> 26:48.827
No. Can we talk in private? Please?

26:48.868 --> 26:51.955
I'm in trouble. So is Faith.

26:51.997 --> 26:55.667
- There's the magic fucking word.
- Come with me to your car.

26:55.709 --> 26:58.712
- There's something you have to see.
- What's going on?

26:58.753 --> 27:01.548
It's a bad situation.

27:01.590 --> 27:05.343
- What?
- If they get me, I know they'll...

27:05.385 --> 27:07.012
Who?

27:07.053 --> 27:09.556
Oh, shit.

27:14.394 --> 27:16.479
Hang on! That's my car!

27:16.521 --> 27:19.357
Not anymore. It belongs to the bank.

27:19.399 --> 27:21.484
Hey, wait a second.

27:21.526 --> 27:23.612
- Whoops.
- Oh, yeah.

27:23.653 --> 27:28.658
Two million years of human evolution,
that's the best you can come up with.

27:28.700 --> 27:31.661
What do you get to repo a car?
200? 250?

27:31.703 --> 27:34.205
I'll pay you 350 right now.

27:34.247 --> 27:37.375
- You got the cash?
- I was gonna write you a check.

27:37.417 --> 27:41.588
- See ya.
- I respect that. I would want cash.

27:41.630 --> 27:45.967
They'll take my check inside.
Just give me two minutes.

27:46.009 --> 27:48.970
Here. You can keep
my watch for collateral.

27:49.012 --> 27:52.140
It's... It's a Rolex.

27:52.182 --> 27:55.852
I'll be right back. Two minutes.
Two minutes?

27:59.231 --> 28:01.358
Son of a bitch!

28:13.703 --> 28:16.498
What happened to your car this time?

28:16.539 --> 28:21.503
See, Lenny, if you packed your piece,
you could make the guy see sense.

28:22.170 --> 28:24.297
Bobby, turn this up.

28:24.339 --> 28:29.052
# You watch us take it all
then you'll understand our pain

28:29.094 --> 28:33.098
# We'll make you the rat
that crawled through the cracks

28:33.139 --> 28:35.100
# You love that red, white, and blue

28:35.141 --> 28:38.061
# But you hate the black,
black, black

28:39.688 --> 28:42.732
# And you try to make me think
I did this to myself

28:42.774 --> 28:47.445
# When the drugs I smoke and the
guns I tote both came from your shelf

28:52.951 --> 28:55.620
# I never had a dream, cos

28:57.497 --> 28:59.791
# My life is a nightmare

29:00.792 --> 29:04.421
# America's been my bogeyman
for 400 years #

29:08.133 --> 29:10.427
'Are you asking me how I feel?'

29:10.468 --> 29:13.555
'We felt Jeriko. We listened to him!'

29:13.597 --> 29:17.809
'The LAPD is a military force

29:17.851 --> 29:21.229
'turned against its own people.

29:21.271 --> 29:23.732
'We live in a police state...'

29:23.773 --> 29:25.817
Hey, Macey.

29:25.859 --> 29:27.193
Shh.

29:27.235 --> 29:30.947
'... with their social programs
that don't work.'

29:32.657 --> 29:36.912
'They're rearranging deck chairs
on the Titanic.

29:36.953 --> 29:39.706
'But a new day is coming.

29:41.166 --> 29:44.044
'2K is coming.

29:44.085 --> 29:47.547
'The day of reckoning is upon us.

29:47.589 --> 29:52.636

and begins again...

'right here... right now.'

29:55.764 --> 29:59.267
Right on! To the end of all things.

29:59.309 --> 30:02.020
You know how I know
it's the end of the world?

30:02.062 --> 30:05.607
- No. Tell me.
- Everything's already been done.

30:05.649 --> 30:10.445
Every kind of music's been tried,
every government's been tried,

30:10.487 --> 30:13.698
every fucking hairstyle,
bubble gum flavors,

30:13.740 --> 30:16.159
you know, breakfast cereal.

30:16.201 --> 30:21.122
What are we going to do? How are we
going to make another thousand years?

30:21.164 --> 30:24.960
I'm telling you, man, it's over.
We used it all up.

30:25.001 --> 30:28.338
- So, what's this week's sad story?
- They jerked my wheels.

30:28.380 --> 30:32.259
It's outrageous the computer errors
the banks make. Have you noticed?

30:32.300 --> 30:35.387
No, I haven't,
because I make my payments.

30:35.428 --> 30:38.181
So, Max Peltier,
how's the PI business?

30:38.223 --> 30:40.767
Sucks. But when I get
this new logo...

30:40.809 --> 30:43.019
I want to hear this scumbag.

30:43.061 --> 30:46.314
- 'Do you have any leads?'
- 'Was there adequate security?'

30:46.356 --> 30:51.736
'There was adequate security
available. He chose not to have it.'

30:51.778 --> 30:54.990
- Why is he a scumbag?
- You-know-who left Lenny for him.

30:55.031 --> 30:57.867
- Faith left Lenny for him?
- Don't say Faith.

30:57.909 --> 31:02.497
You use the "F" word around Lenny,
you got to tranquillize him.

31:02.539 --> 31:04.040
Shh!

31:04.082 --> 31:06.126
'I know I've lost a friend.

31:06.167 --> 31:11.298
'A man of great courage, which is
more than I can say for most of us.'

31:11.339 --> 31:13.758
- If you're riding...
- OK, let's go.

31:17.345 --> 31:19.431
Fuck you, you pig!

31:22.601 --> 31:24.686
Driving Mr. Lenny.

31:24.728 --> 31:28.732
It's gonna be a big night.
Feel the energy in the air.

31:28.773 --> 31:31.234
There's money to be made,
dreams to sell.

31:31.276 --> 31:34.029
- Sleaze to peddle.
- That is so unenlightened.

31:34.070 --> 31:36.156
I sell experiences.

31:36.197 --> 31:39.534
The way I see it, I'm performing
a humanitarian service.

31:39.576 --> 31:43.038
- I probably save lives.
- I don't want to hear this.

31:43.079 --> 31:47.792
Everybody needs to walk to the dark
end of the street sometimes.

31:47.834 --> 31:51.588
The risks... The streets are
a war zone. Sex can kill you.

31:51.630 --> 31:53.506
Slip on the 'trodes,

31:53.548 --> 31:57.969
get what you need almost as good as
the real thing and a lot safer.

31:58.011 --> 32:01.765
Porno. Face it, you sell porno
to wireheads.

32:01.806 --> 32:03.558
Harsh. Harsh and untrue.

32:03.600 --> 32:06.811
My clients are professionals.
Some are even celebrities.

32:06.853 --> 32:09.981
- What celebrities?
- The guy from the news.

32:10.023 --> 32:12.943
- He does the weather.
- That counts.

32:12.984 --> 32:16.238
- Hey, you passed La Cienega.
- I'm not taking La Cienega.

32:16.279 --> 32:18.782
It's the quickest way to the club.

32:18.823 --> 32:21.451
I've got business there.
I'm meeting people.

32:21.493 --> 32:22.911
Mace, you're my friend.

32:22.953 --> 32:25.997
I'll give you 25%
of what I make tonight.

32:26.039 --> 32:30.544
This may be hard for you, but friends
don't have to pay their friends.

32:30.585 --> 32:33.922
- Faith's singing there tonight.
- I should have known.

32:35.006 --> 32:39.386
Look, I've pulled 12 hours.
I got to get some sleep.

32:39.427 --> 32:42.347
I got a pick-up at the St James Club.

32:42.389 --> 32:45.725
You can catch a cab. It'll take you
wherever you wanna go.

32:45.767 --> 32:49.312
A taxi? Well, someone might see me.

32:49.354 --> 32:54.568
Hold it right there, ma'am.
Whoa. Hold it right there.

32:54.609 --> 32:58.113
- You made me late.
- What's your pickup's name?

32:58.154 --> 33:00.532
- Fumitsu.
- Fumitsu?

33:00.574 --> 33:02.659
Fumitsu. Fumitsu.

33:02.701 --> 33:05.078
Leave the car right here.

33:05.120 --> 33:09.124
- Oh, fuck.
- Get the one on the right.

33:11.126 --> 33:13.253
- Nero.
- Strickland.

33:13.295 --> 33:14.754
Commissioner Strickland.

33:14.796 --> 33:19.467
Since you shit-canned my career,
I don't even have to call you sir.

33:19.509 --> 33:22.095
Aren't you a little far
from your usual gutter?

33:22.137 --> 33:25.807
I was invited here by a friend,
Mr. Fumitsu. He's over there.

33:27.726 --> 33:32.105
I don't like disappointments. You
know what disappoints me very much?

33:32.147 --> 33:34.608
Your sex life? Excuse me.

33:34.649 --> 33:36.276
Mr. Fumitsu.

33:37.903 --> 33:40.196
- Konbanwa.
- Konbanwa.

33:40.238 --> 33:43.241
Leonard Nero, BLS Limousine
and Security Service.

33:43.283 --> 33:47.454
I've arranged for one of our finest
drivers Lornette Mason to take you.

33:47.495 --> 33:50.832
She's a security specialist,
trained in defensive combat,

33:50.874 --> 33:53.835
and the car's bulletproof
and fully armored.

33:53.877 --> 33:58.506
I'll be coming along to do our
routine periodic driver evaluation.

33:58.548 --> 34:02.052
We do it to ensure
that our VIP clients

34:02.093 --> 34:04.638
are always treated
as honored guests.

34:04.679 --> 34:08.391
Good evening, Mr. Fumitsu.
Sir, please watch your head.

34:12.020 --> 34:13.897
Excuse me, Mr. Nero.

34:13.938 --> 34:15.857
Excuse me, sir!

34:15.899 --> 34:19.652
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Coming with you.

34:24.991 --> 34:28.245
You will not live
to see the morning.

34:30.455 --> 34:32.541
Drive on.

34:39.630 --> 34:42.884
Are you a cop?

34:42.926 --> 34:46.388
No? Good. Have you ever been wired?

34:46.429 --> 34:49.349
Wired?

34:49.683 --> 34:52.476
- The latest technology.
- Oh...

34:52.518 --> 34:54.271
That is beautiful.

34:54.312 --> 34:56.815
You got to take a look at this, OK?

34:56.856 --> 34:58.400
Yeah.

34:58.441 --> 35:01.611
- You're gonna love it.
- You have more?

35:01.653 --> 35:03.822
I have more. Believe me.

35:16.751 --> 35:20.213
Hey! Hey! Careful on the jacket.
It's Armani.

35:20.255 --> 35:23.466
- Hey, are you angry?
- No wirehead shit in my car!

35:23.508 --> 35:26.136
- You're on foot!
- In LA? Are you crazy?

35:32.517 --> 35:36.229
Can I come in? I'm having a hard time
hearing the stereo!

35:38.064 --> 35:40.775
I need my case.
It's still in the back.

35:47.824 --> 35:51.244
Can we talk here,
like two rational adults?

35:52.621 --> 35:54.039
Uhh!

35:54.915 --> 35:57.334
Um, that would be no.

35:58.543 --> 36:00.420
OK, you got my attention.

36:00.462 --> 36:04.174
This is cutting off the circulation
in my head. Do you mind?

36:04.216 --> 36:05.675
Macey...

36:15.143 --> 36:17.437
It's cool, it's nothing. Two seconds.

36:17.479 --> 36:21.358
This is uncharacteristic for you,
Miss Ice Water In Her Veins.

36:21.399 --> 36:25.445
You pushed me too far! You made me
lose it in front of a client!

36:25.487 --> 36:28.323
- I could get fired!
- Are we still friends?

36:28.365 --> 36:32.160
Friendship is more than one person
doing favors for another.

36:32.202 --> 36:34.871
- I know.
- I don't hustle my friends.

36:34.913 --> 36:38.917
You just suck people along with
your schemes and your slick act.

36:38.959 --> 36:41.962
- We're still buddies?
- Don't use the time I'm talking

36:42.003 --> 36:44.297
to think about what
you're gonna say next.

36:44.339 --> 36:46.216
- You listening?
- Yeah.

36:46.258 --> 36:49.344
You're always broke, you go
from one score to the next.

36:49.386 --> 36:52.681
You're strung-out.
You don't even see it.

36:52.722 --> 36:56.142
It's your brain, so do whatever
the hell you want with it,

36:56.184 --> 36:58.436
but not on my watch.

36:58.478 --> 37:00.939
I got a child, I got rent,

37:00.981 --> 37:05.151
and I got an ex-husband doing hard
time who doesn't send me a dime.

37:05.193 --> 37:07.696
I'm just trying to hold on here.

37:08.738 --> 37:12.784
I know you wouldn't say this if
you didn't care about me. Thanks.

37:12.826 --> 37:16.788
You're getting out with Fumitsu,
and that's the end.

37:19.541 --> 37:22.085
I'll get you to the Templars
in ten minutes.

37:22.127 --> 37:25.422
- Sorry for the inconvenience.
- I'm changing my plans.

37:25.463 --> 37:30.594
Mr. Nero has recommended an excellent
club, the Retinal Fetish.

37:30.635 --> 37:33.221
- It's on La Cienega.
- Yes, sir.

37:41.980 --> 37:46.735
- Enjoy your evening, Mr. Fumitsu.
- Mace, I appreciate it. Thank you.

37:47.402 --> 37:49.571
Hey, come on.

37:49.613 --> 37:51.489
Excuse us.

37:52.324 --> 37:54.200
Excuse us.

37:55.535 --> 37:57.120
Excuse us.

37:57.162 --> 38:01.917
This is a friend of mine, Mr. Fumitsu.
Can you take care of him?

38:01.958 --> 38:05.921
John, could you take care
of this gentleman?

38:07.088 --> 38:09.174
Hey. Bye.

39:10.902 --> 39:14.656
- Hey, Lenny. How ya doing?
- Who's the new guy in Gant's posse?

39:14.698 --> 39:18.868
Wade Beemer, played running back
for the Rams, '96, '97.

39:18.910 --> 39:21.079
Like a fucking freight train.

39:25.166 --> 39:28.044
- Rams... Football, right?
- No, ping-pong

39:28.086 --> 39:30.213
Hey, Iris was looking for you.

39:37.095 --> 39:38.763
Hello, Lenny.

39:38.805 --> 39:42.809
It's OK, Wade, he's an old friend
of mine, Lenny Nero.

39:43.852 --> 39:47.022
Come to peddle me some clips
for old time's sake,

39:47.063 --> 39:49.482
or just makin' a few bucks
for the holidays?

39:49.524 --> 39:53.278
I wouldn't sell you
the sweat off a dead dog's balls.

39:53.320 --> 39:56.573
I've already got everything
I need from you.

39:57.449 --> 39:59.534
Cut it out, Philo.

39:59.576 --> 40:01.912
Too bad about your guy Jeriko.

40:01.953 --> 40:04.080
You lost your golden goose.

40:04.122 --> 40:07.417
Show some respect.
He was an important artist.

40:07.459 --> 40:10.879
Important for your label,
which is why you're mourning.

40:10.921 --> 40:14.674
His records will sell out
now he's dead, and you'll make out.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.384
Always do.

40:16.426 --> 40:19.596
Faith, can I talk to you
for one second?

40:19.638 --> 40:22.432
It's not a good idea right now.

40:22.474 --> 40:24.601
Just for one second, OK?

40:24.643 --> 40:28.438
- About what?
- That would be between me and Faith.

40:30.857 --> 40:33.985
Funny, I don't feel anything
between you and Faith.

40:34.027 --> 40:35.612
You see...

40:35.654 --> 40:38.657
that's your problem, Lenny,
you assume too much.

40:38.698 --> 40:41.618
You assume there's something
where there's nothing,

40:41.660 --> 40:43.954
you assume that you have a life,

40:43.995 --> 40:48.208
when in fact, you're just peddling
pieces of other people's lives

40:48.250 --> 40:50.710
and the broken parts of your own.

40:50.752 --> 40:52.295
Faith...

40:52.337 --> 40:54.214
Get him to his car.

40:54.256 --> 40:57.133
Call me, OK? Faith!

40:57.175 --> 40:59.386
Call me!

40:59.427 --> 41:01.429
Lenny the loser.

41:01.471 --> 41:05.183
- Leave him alone, Philo, OK?
- You shouldn't talk to him.

41:05.225 --> 41:09.104
You shouldn't talk to anybody,
not with everything that's going on.

41:09.145 --> 41:12.857
You are too goddam paranoid.
You know that, Philo?

41:12.899 --> 41:15.360
Paranoia's just...

41:15.402 --> 41:17.988
reality on a finer scale.

41:21.366 --> 41:23.243
Thank you

41:58.028 --> 42:01.072
Awoo! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

42:07.996 --> 42:11.875
- Hey.
- Hey! What's up, my brother?

42:13.043 --> 42:17.505
- Those rascals haven't grown back?
- No. Any day now. I just know it.

42:17.547 --> 42:19.633
Hey, I got something for you.

42:19.674 --> 42:23.428
It's a present,
something I had custom-made.

42:23.470 --> 42:25.597
- Happy Millennium.
- Oh.

42:26.556 --> 42:30.352
I got something for you, too.
Just showed up tonight.

42:30.393 --> 42:33.355
I don't know who from.

42:33.396 --> 42:36.316
Fan mail from some flounder?

43:02.217 --> 43:03.468
Mmm.

43:07.597 --> 43:10.141
- Hi.
- Hi.

43:23.196 --> 43:26.533
# Strange days not like before #

43:56.521 --> 43:59.649
# I can hardly wait

44:02.736 --> 44:06.114
# I can hardly wait

44:08.783 --> 44:12.120
# I can hardly wait

44:14.581 --> 44:18.501
# I can hardly wait

44:22.547 --> 44:25.175
# It's been so long

44:25.217 --> 44:28.845
# I've lost my taste

44:28.887 --> 44:31.306
# Say angel, come

44:31.348 --> 44:34.476
# Say lick my face

44:34.517 --> 44:37.479
# Let fall your drapes

44:37.520 --> 44:40.649
# I'll play the part

44:40.690 --> 44:44.402
# I open this mouth wide

44:44.444 --> 44:49.366
# Eat your heart... #

44:51.993 --> 44:56.456
# Your heart

44:59.167 --> 45:02.254
# I can hardly wait

45:05.173 --> 45:08.510
# I can hardly wait

45:11.638 --> 45:14.516
# I can hardly wait

45:17.185 --> 45:21.064
# I can hardly wait

45:25.193 --> 45:27.779
# Lips crack dry

45:27.821 --> 45:31.074
# Tongue bursts

45:31.116 --> 45:33.994
# Say angel, come

45:34.035 --> 45:36.538
# Say lick my face

45:36.580 --> 45:40.208
# It's been so long

45:40.250 --> 45:43.378
# I've lost my taste

45:43.420 --> 45:46.339
# Here, Romeo

45:46.381 --> 45:48.717
# Make my watered brain #

45:59.811 --> 46:01.688
Hi, baby.

46:01.730 --> 46:03.648
I missed you.

46:03.690 --> 46:06.401
Lenny, you have to leave. I mean it.

46:06.443 --> 46:09.446
Iris said you were in trouble.
What did she mean?

46:09.487 --> 46:12.157
- You talked to Iris? When?
- Tonight.

46:12.198 --> 46:14.576
I haven't seen that girl in months.

46:14.618 --> 46:17.370
Who knows what's going on
in that whore's head?

46:17.412 --> 46:19.497
She used to be your best friend.

46:19.539 --> 46:24.461
Iris? You're really running out of
excuses to come around, aren't you?

46:24.502 --> 46:28.048
I know you. You're afraid
of something. What's going on?

46:28.089 --> 46:30.926
Let it alone.
It will take care of itself.

46:30.967 --> 46:33.428
It's Gant, isn't it? He's poison.

46:33.470 --> 46:37.015
He's got you walled in
and he uses the wire too much.

46:37.057 --> 46:39.434
He gets off on tape, not on you.

46:39.476 --> 46:42.312
That's a good one coming from you.

46:42.354 --> 46:45.565
- Why don't you just split?
- Cos I don't want to.

46:45.607 --> 46:48.443
Do you love him? I don't think so.

46:48.485 --> 46:52.447
To him, you're some kind of
possession. You're like a Ferrari.

46:52.489 --> 46:56.034
You're just something
to show the other guys.

46:56.076 --> 46:59.246
Yeah? He has his uses, too, you know.

46:59.287 --> 47:02.332
What? He going to record you
on his label?

47:02.374 --> 47:04.459
He might.

47:04.501 --> 47:06.586
You never know, right?

47:07.504 --> 47:09.589
Faith...

47:09.631 --> 47:14.094
Faith, listen to me. I've watched you
create yourself out of nothing.

47:14.135 --> 47:19.975
You're like a goddam cruise missile
targeted on making it, and you will.

47:20.016 --> 47:22.769
I know I will.

47:22.811 --> 47:25.272
It's you up on that stage, not him.

47:25.313 --> 47:27.399
You don't need him.

47:29.943 --> 47:33.697
Get out of here. If Philo
catches you, he'll hurt you.

47:33.738 --> 47:37.325
- I'm already hurting.
- I'm serious. He's acting crazy.

47:37.367 --> 47:41.329
He's doing way too much playback.
He's gotten completely paranoid.

47:41.371 --> 47:46.209
He's such a control freak now, he's
even paying Max to follow me around.

47:46.251 --> 47:49.880
- Max? You're kidding.
- Yeah, for about a month now.

47:50.672 --> 47:52.132
Jesus.

47:52.173 --> 47:58.138
Look, Lenny, just stay away
from Philo and stay away from me.

47:58.179 --> 48:00.932
Stop trying to rescue me.
Those days are over.

48:00.974 --> 48:02.934
I'm a big girl now. I've changed.

48:02.976 --> 48:07.522
Stop trying to save me, I don't need
saving. Just give up on me!

48:08.815 --> 48:12.360
I just... I just wanted to make sure
you were all right.

48:15.030 --> 48:19.284
You know one of the ways that movies
are still better than playback?

48:19.326 --> 48:22.245
Cos the music comes up,
there's credits,

48:22.287 --> 48:25.290
and you always know when it's over.

48:26.541 --> 48:28.627
It's over!

48:30.712 --> 48:32.797
You were great.

48:39.179 --> 48:42.015
Hey, man. I know what
you're thinking.

48:42.057 --> 48:46.770
- She told me about your new gig.
- Man, I feel like shit about it.

48:46.811 --> 48:50.607
- You should feel like shit.
- I do feel like shit. OK?

48:50.649 --> 48:54.611
- Hey, you introduced me to Gant.
- I introduced him to Faith, too.

48:54.653 --> 48:58.782
Questionable move,
given the historical perspective.

48:58.823 --> 49:02.369
I can take his money. You wouldn't
believe what I'm charging.

49:02.410 --> 49:05.497
And I make sure Faith is OK
at the same time.

49:05.539 --> 49:07.999
Keep an eye on her, for you. OK?

49:08.041 --> 49:12.337
Which you can't do without getting
your fingers bent the wrong way back.

49:12.379 --> 49:15.465
I'm busted, man. I need the money.

49:15.507 --> 49:19.678
- This does us both some good.
- Fairly twisted logic, even for you.

49:19.719 --> 49:22.764
- Hey, you got a job.
- I got a job.

49:22.806 --> 49:24.891
OK. I'm sorry. You got a job.

49:24.933 --> 49:27.102
- That's great.
- I got a job!

49:27.143 --> 49:30.855
Hey, listen. You got to stay on her.
Watch her for me, please.

49:30.897 --> 49:34.192
- I'm on her.
- OK.

49:34.234 --> 49:36.736
- Take it easy, all right?
- Yeah. You, too.

49:40.991 --> 49:43.076
Come on.

49:45.203 --> 49:48.582
Here, chicky, chicky, chicky,
chicky, chicky...

49:48.623 --> 49:52.335
Hey, wait a minute. I recognize you.
You're Wade Beemer, right?

49:52.377 --> 49:55.797
Running back for the Rams. '96, '97.

49:55.839 --> 49:59.342
- Am I right?
- Yeah. Th-That's right.

49:59.384 --> 50:03.013
I saw you play, man.
I mean, you were good, really good.

50:03.054 --> 50:05.348
Like a fuckin' freight train.

50:05.390 --> 50:07.601
What happened? Injuries or what?

50:07.642 --> 50:10.520
- Oh, bullshit politics.
- It's always politics.

50:10.562 --> 50:13.064
Like this thing.
He's paying you to tune me up.

50:13.106 --> 50:15.233
I could pay you more not to.

50:15.275 --> 50:19.321
- I could write a check right now.
- Ah... I got to go.

50:19.362 --> 50:23.033
OK. Cash... Cash!
Here's everything I have on me.

50:23.074 --> 50:26.286
Oh, look. What do you say?
How about, uh, a Rolex?

50:27.370 --> 50:29.706
I got a real one.

50:29.748 --> 50:33.251
Come on. It won't hurt too bad.
It's nothing personal.

50:33.293 --> 50:35.837
Just one second, please.

50:38.465 --> 50:41.801
It's my jacket. It's...
It's really expensive.

50:41.843 --> 50:44.471
And just not... not the eyes.

50:57.692 --> 50:59.569
You're bleeding.

50:59.611 --> 51:03.240
Some jerk puked on the stairs,
and I slipped. I should sue.

51:03.281 --> 51:05.158
You came back for me.

51:05.200 --> 51:08.161
I came back to pick up my client.

51:08.203 --> 51:10.622
No, you came back for me.

51:10.664 --> 51:13.583
I got to lie down, Macey,
please, in the back?

51:33.562 --> 51:35.939
Some piece of work, Lenny Nero.

51:37.023 --> 51:40.360
You're calmly backstroking along
in the big toilet bowl,

51:40.402 --> 51:43.029
and somehow,
you never let it touch you.

51:43.071 --> 51:47.826
I mean, between working vice and your
current so-called occupation,

51:47.868 --> 51:50.245
you must have seen every perversion.

51:50.287 --> 51:53.665
But you just like some Teflon man.

51:53.707 --> 51:58.044
Still come out this...
goofball romantic.

51:58.086 --> 52:01.339
It's my sword and my shield, Macey.

52:12.517 --> 52:15.604
All right. A little B & E action.

52:15.645 --> 52:17.606
- What'd you say?
- Oh, nothing.

53:58.290 --> 54:00.166
Shit.

54:14.723 --> 54:16.683
No, no.

54:16.725 --> 54:18.810
Please. Please.

54:18.852 --> 54:20.228
Please...

54:20.270 --> 54:23.273
You can let me go, please.

54:23.315 --> 54:26.443
I haven't seen your face. Please.

54:26.484 --> 54:30.864
L-Let me go.
Let me go, please...

54:30.906 --> 54:33.158
Oh, my... Holy...

54:36.286 --> 54:38.788
Lenny...

54:39.414 --> 54:40.582
Lenny!

54:40.624 --> 54:43.585
Go to the Sunset Regent right now.

54:43.627 --> 54:45.962
Go! Go!

54:59.392 --> 55:01.269
Oh, Christ.

55:05.941 --> 55:08.735
He's jacking it into his own output!

55:08.777 --> 55:10.946
She's seeing what he's seeing.

55:10.987 --> 55:14.241
She's... She's seeing herself!

55:41.518 --> 55:43.186
Ohh...

55:47.941 --> 55:49.693
My God...

56:04.916 --> 56:07.127
God!

56:23.560 --> 56:26.313
Oh, my God... Oh, my God...

57:12.692 --> 57:15.195
Lenny... What is it?

57:15.237 --> 57:18.490
- A black-jack.
- Black-jack?

57:18.532 --> 57:20.784
A snuff clip.

57:22.202 --> 57:23.954
It was Iris.

57:23.995 --> 57:27.707
- The sick fucker killed her.
- Are you sure it's real?

57:38.343 --> 57:43.098
Tell 'em we got a 187.
Call it in.

58:31.646 --> 58:33.732
Well, I lost my appetite...

58:33.773 --> 58:35.859
for about a year.

58:40.197 --> 58:43.992
- Wanna take a look?
- Hell, no. I don't fool with that.

58:46.953 --> 58:49.122
- You all right?
- Yeah.

58:49.164 --> 58:51.374
- You OK?
- No. Not really.

58:55.086 --> 58:57.923
All right. Let's work it.

58:57.964 --> 59:00.592
No, I... I can't.

59:00.634 --> 59:03.303
Come on, Lenny,
you used to be good at this shit.

59:03.345 --> 59:05.722
Let's play it down.
What's the perp doing?

59:05.764 --> 59:08.767
- I can't.
- You used to be a fuckin' cop, OK?

59:08.808 --> 59:11.436
Now, that is a fucking murder.

59:12.187 --> 59:15.440
- What's he doing?
- OK. H-He stalks her.

59:15.482 --> 59:18.360
And, uh...

59:18.401 --> 59:20.820
he rapes her... and he does her.

59:20.862 --> 59:24.199
And records it, right?
He wants to see it again and again.

59:24.241 --> 59:27.410
He records himself
raping and killing.

59:27.452 --> 59:30.580
- While sending a signal to her.
- So she feels what he feels

59:30.622 --> 59:32.707
while he's inside her.

59:32.749 --> 59:37.671
The thrill while he's killing her
is sent to her, heightening her fear,

59:37.712 --> 59:41.383
which, in turn,
heightens the turn-on for him.

59:42.968 --> 59:45.095
I've seen... I've seen a lot.

59:45.136 --> 59:47.556
- So have I. Too much.
- It's a bad one.

59:51.142 --> 59:55.105
He makes her see her own death,
feeds off the reaction.

59:55.146 --> 59:57.774
He records it all. Everything.

59:57.816 --> 01:00:01.653
- And gives it to you.
- Yeah. He wants to share it.

01:00:01.695 --> 01:00:04.906
Of course he wants to share, man.
That's his deal.

01:00:04.948 --> 01:00:07.784
He needs an audience.
This is a sick puppy.

01:00:07.826 --> 01:00:11.121
- Why me?
- Cos you're the magic man, Lenny.

01:00:11.162 --> 01:00:13.248
You make dreams happen.

01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:17.419
If it's got something to do with
the wire, it washes up on your beach.

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.214
I've never dealt in black-jacks.
Never. Everybody knows that.

01:00:21.256 --> 01:00:25.510
He's just skull-fucking you, buddy.
He just wants a reaction out of you.

01:00:25.552 --> 01:00:29.055
He wants to make you do something
that you do not want to do.

01:00:29.097 --> 01:00:32.475
Maybe he figures Lenny will
appreciate what he's created.

01:00:32.517 --> 01:00:35.604
It's the dark end of the street.
How do you like it now?

01:00:35.645 --> 01:00:40.650
- Jesus, Mace, back off.
- This guy's one of your squid-heads.

01:00:40.692 --> 01:00:44.154
- He's somebody you know, Lenny.
- The problem with that is

01:00:44.196 --> 01:00:46.656
Lenny knows... everybody.

01:00:46.698 --> 01:00:49.618
- Take the tape to the cops.
- No.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:53.413
No. I'll... They'll crucify me.

01:00:53.455 --> 01:00:58.460
So this wire-freak
gets to keep running around, huh?

01:00:58.501 --> 01:01:00.629
The police will think he's the perp.

01:01:00.670 --> 01:01:03.798
They'll go through his client list,
and ruin his life...

01:01:04.466 --> 01:01:06.551
such as it is.

01:01:06.593 --> 01:01:09.721
I'll call my buddies at homicide,
say Iris was my friend.

01:01:09.763 --> 01:01:13.892
That'll put me in the loop. I'll get
the forensics and all that shit.

01:01:13.934 --> 01:01:18.897
Get some sleep. I'll call you
when I get something. Relax!

01:01:21.233 --> 01:01:23.276
Lenny!

01:01:23.318 --> 01:01:26.404
Keep moving, man.
Somebody's thinking about you a lot.

01:02:03.775 --> 01:02:05.527
Leave me alone!

01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:10.156
Don't come to my house.
Are you trying to ruin my life?

01:02:10.198 --> 01:02:13.118
Iris is dead. She was murdered.

01:02:17.289 --> 01:02:20.208
- Who did it?
- Whoever he is, he's damaged goods.

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:22.544
Iris said you were in danger, too.

01:02:22.586 --> 01:02:25.505
- I'm not in any danger.
- Faith! No more games.

01:02:25.547 --> 01:02:30.218
Whatever you're hiding you have
to get out of here. Come with me now!

01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:33.513
Then what? Are you gonna protect me?
Are you a tough guy?

01:02:33.555 --> 01:02:36.808
You're a fucking talker.
You don't even own a gun.

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:39.060
I have a gun under my bed.

01:02:43.857 --> 01:02:46.943
You don't know what you're
fucking with here.

01:02:46.985 --> 01:02:50.280
- Tell me.
- Tell him, Faith. Go on.

01:02:51.781 --> 01:02:56.161
Uh, listen. Lenny just stopped by
to give me some bad news, OK?

01:02:56.203 --> 01:02:59.831
An old friend of mine's
been murdered. Remember Iris?

01:02:59.873 --> 01:03:02.000
How the fuck did you get up here?

01:03:02.042 --> 01:03:03.543
Charm.

01:03:04.753 --> 01:03:08.173
Tell you what, Lenny.
Just for you, hmm?

01:03:08.215 --> 01:03:11.301
Make you a deal.
Why don't you just take her? Hm?

01:03:11.343 --> 01:03:14.804
If she's so unhappy and she wants
to leave, she can go!

01:03:14.846 --> 01:03:19.267
Besides, Faith always knows
what she wants. Don't you, baby?

01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:22.020
See? Hands off.

01:03:24.356 --> 01:03:28.818
I'll tell you something else.
I'll tell you this, you fuck.

01:03:28.860 --> 01:03:31.863
If she says she stays, you go.

01:03:31.905 --> 01:03:34.950
You crawl back to wherever
the fuck it is you came from

01:03:34.991 --> 01:03:37.077
and never cross my vision again.

01:03:41.665 --> 01:03:43.124
Faith...

01:03:45.043 --> 01:03:46.920
Come on.

01:03:52.342 --> 01:03:54.427
Come on...

01:04:01.768 --> 01:04:04.020
I've made my choice, Lenny.

01:04:09.985 --> 01:04:12.070
Get him out.

01:04:12.863 --> 01:04:14.948
Get him out!

01:04:14.990 --> 01:04:18.994
You're fucking crazy, Faith!
You're fucking crazy! Come with me!

01:04:19.035 --> 01:04:20.996
Faith!

01:04:24.249 --> 01:04:27.711
I don't love you anymore.
Do you understand that?

01:04:27.752 --> 01:04:33.216
You mean nothing to me!
Leave me alone, Lenny, please!

01:04:36.928 --> 01:04:40.849
You said you were gonna get Iris
out of this, Philo.

01:04:40.891 --> 01:04:43.184
Now you understand
the danger we're in.

01:04:43.226 --> 01:04:47.397
So sweet what you said out there,
so touching. I almost believed it.

01:04:47.439 --> 01:04:51.401
I don't think he even understands
you did it for him.

01:04:51.443 --> 01:04:54.154
He doesn't know what's going on.
Leave him alone!

01:04:54.196 --> 01:04:56.072
I'd love to leave him alone

01:04:56.114 --> 01:04:59.784
if he'd stop coming round
and you'd stop talking!

01:05:03.121 --> 01:05:06.374
The only time a whore should open
her mouth is when she's giving head.

01:05:14.132 --> 01:05:16.551
Shit! Mace! Help!

01:05:16.593 --> 01:05:19.846
Don't be shy, Lenny.
This is your floor.

01:05:19.888 --> 01:05:23.016
Come on now, Lenny.
You're going to the hospital.

01:05:23.058 --> 01:05:26.978
Can we be smart here?
I could make it worth your while.

01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:30.982
I don't mind a couple of shots.
Just go light is all I'm saying.

01:05:31.024 --> 01:05:33.109
Here, look. Take my Rolex.

01:05:34.236 --> 01:05:37.447
Ooh, nice watch.

01:05:37.489 --> 01:05:39.699
- Is this impact resistant?
- Sure.

01:05:41.284 --> 01:05:43.495
You stupid piece of shit!

01:05:43.537 --> 01:05:45.622
You stupid fuck. Get up!

01:05:45.664 --> 01:05:47.999
Come on. Get up!

01:05:52.128 --> 01:05:54.589
Oh, ho. Pain. Pain!

01:05:59.803 --> 01:06:03.181
We tried to find a smaller girl
to beat the shit out of you,

01:06:03.223 --> 01:06:05.267
but it was short notice.

01:06:05.308 --> 01:06:07.143
It was short notice!

01:06:07.185 --> 01:06:10.939
Oh! Ow! That one had to hurt.

01:06:26.830 --> 01:06:28.915
Safety's on.

01:06:46.683 --> 01:06:48.894
Come on. Let's go.

01:06:50.103 --> 01:06:51.980
Hey, wait!

01:06:59.237 --> 01:07:02.115
- I need a drink.
- Lenny, get some rest.

01:07:02.157 --> 01:07:04.701
The cops know they'll
never nail this guy

01:07:04.743 --> 01:07:07.078
the second they walk in the room.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.581
It's all about
what they see walking in...

01:07:09.623 --> 01:07:12.500
dead hooker, handcuffs, penetration.

01:07:12.542 --> 01:07:17.005
Cops are lazy, and they know nobody
gives a shit about a dead hooker.

01:07:17.047 --> 01:07:19.132
They're roadkill, right?

01:07:19.174 --> 01:07:21.927
So they'll take pictures, make jokes,

01:07:21.968 --> 01:07:24.888
and just shrug it off
like it's a random kill.

01:07:24.930 --> 01:07:29.142
- It's the kind you never solve.
- That doesn't add, does it?

01:07:29.184 --> 01:07:32.729
Iris said she knew somebody
was after her. That is not random.

01:07:32.771 --> 01:07:35.357
If they get me, I...

01:07:35.398 --> 01:07:37.901
She said "they". "If THEY get me."

01:07:37.943 --> 01:07:41.947
Which means this whole random
sex killer thing is bullshit.

01:07:41.988 --> 01:07:46.076
- Somebody whacked her for a reason.
- So this guy's not a psycho?

01:07:46.117 --> 01:07:48.703
He's a psycho.
To do what's on that tape,

01:07:48.745 --> 01:07:51.289
he's not a well-adjusted human being.

01:07:52.040 --> 01:07:54.125
I got to get some sleep.

01:07:54.167 --> 01:07:58.964
OK, Lenny. Put that down,
and I'll check on you tomorrow.

01:07:59.005 --> 01:08:02.092
Hey, you wanna rub my neck?

01:08:02.133 --> 01:08:04.553
My shoulder's real sore.

01:08:04.594 --> 01:08:07.347
OK. All right. Come here.

01:08:09.599 --> 01:08:12.602
- Right here?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:08:12.644 --> 01:08:14.312
Ohh...

01:08:18.899 --> 01:08:20.777
Don't stop.

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:23.321
How's Zander?

01:08:23.363 --> 01:08:25.448
Oh... He's fine.

01:08:27.533 --> 01:08:30.703
- I miss him.
- He misses you, too.

01:08:32.455 --> 01:08:35.917
I'm real sorry about being
so hard on you earlier.

01:08:35.959 --> 01:08:42.090
I just see you getting sucked into
this deeper and deeper, and, um...

01:08:42.131 --> 01:08:45.760
Macey, come on.
I know you still love me.

01:08:52.475 --> 01:08:55.520
How can you do this
in front of your child?

01:08:55.562 --> 01:08:57.647
In front of your son.

01:08:57.689 --> 01:09:00.649
- Mace, hold on. Mace...
- In front of your son!

01:09:03.737 --> 01:09:05.613
Zander!

01:09:07.115 --> 01:09:08.867
Zander!

01:09:08.908 --> 01:09:11.870
"When a child loves you
for a long, long time,

01:09:11.912 --> 01:09:15.122
"not just to play with,
but really loves you..."

01:09:15.165 --> 01:09:17.000
- Hi, honey.
- Hi, Mommy!

01:09:17.042 --> 01:09:19.920
- This is Lenny.
- Hi.

01:09:42.234 --> 01:09:45.694
'Hi, it's Lenny.
Just what do you have in mind?'

01:09:46.947 --> 01:09:50.700
'Hey, the last day of the world
and you spend it in bed?'

01:09:54.078 --> 01:09:56.414
- What's up, Max?
- Not a whole lot, man.

01:09:56.456 --> 01:09:59.292
They've just been saying
words over Jeriko.

01:09:59.334 --> 01:10:01.962
Tension's running
pretty high down here.

01:10:02.003 --> 01:10:03.547
- Faith OK?
- Yeah.

01:10:03.588 --> 01:10:06.258
She's leaving with Gant,
so I got to boogie.

01:10:06.299 --> 01:10:11.054
Iris checked into the Regent last
night under a false name. Paid cash.

01:10:11.096 --> 01:10:13.265
- So she was hiding out.
- Yep.

01:10:13.306 --> 01:10:16.226
I heard you dropped in
on Gant last night.

01:10:16.268 --> 01:10:20.146
- 'Another slick Lenny move, huh?'
- He's in this somehow.

01:10:20.188 --> 01:10:22.899
'Just stay close to Faith, OK?'

01:10:22.941 --> 01:10:24.985
No worries, bro. I gotta jam.

01:13:26.583 --> 01:13:28.668
What up, Lenny?

01:13:29.586 --> 01:13:31.671
- So, where we going?
- Anywhere.

01:13:31.713 --> 01:13:35.425
- You're acting strange, what's up?
- Shh, Mace.

01:13:35.467 --> 01:13:37.969
We'll talk about it in the car.

01:13:39.679 --> 01:13:41.556
Hand me that box of tapes.

01:13:54.069 --> 01:13:56.613
- Oh, shit.
- What's the matter?

01:13:56.655 --> 01:13:58.740
This tie doesn't go with blue.

01:14:06.665 --> 01:14:09.251
Lenny, would you relax?

01:14:09.292 --> 01:14:11.378
We're not being followed.

01:14:11.419 --> 01:14:15.674
- Stop being so paranoid.
- The guy had a knife to my throat

01:14:15.715 --> 01:14:16.925
in my living-room.

01:14:18.093 --> 01:14:21.012
Relaxing might be right out, OK?

01:14:43.577 --> 01:14:48.498
Oh, man. Oh, that is one
unbelievable piece of eye-fuck.

01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:52.335
Skip the art criticism, Tick. What
can you tell me about the wearer?

01:14:52.377 --> 01:14:54.838
That guy is fucked up.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:57.424
- We know that.
- He has some distortion

01:14:57.465 --> 01:14:59.342
in the visual cortex.

01:14:59.384 --> 01:15:03.471
The color and grey-scale values
are messed up, like color-blindness.

01:15:03.513 --> 01:15:07.893
See the peak period ratios? There
could be a tumor or brain lesion.

01:15:07.934 --> 01:15:11.938
Whoever's doing this is using a box
to split the signal...

01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:16.193
- Ever make a box like that?
- A few. I can't see if it's mine.

01:15:17.152 --> 01:15:19.237
I don't like this.

01:15:20.030 --> 01:15:22.490
- This is not good.
- What?

01:15:22.532 --> 01:15:25.619
It's cutting close to me.
She was just here, man!

01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:27.704
- Who?
- Iris!

01:15:27.746 --> 01:15:30.290
- Iris was here?
- She was shaking like a junkie,

01:15:30.332 --> 01:15:33.084
saying she wanted me
to copy some clip.

01:15:33.126 --> 01:15:35.545
- What clip?
- I don't know.

01:15:35.587 --> 01:15:39.007
She said I wouldn't wanna see it.
She was gonna give it to you.

01:15:39.049 --> 01:15:43.136
- She never gave me a tape.
- Think back to what she said.

01:15:43.178 --> 01:15:47.015
She came in. She was crying.
She wanted to go to my car.

01:15:47.057 --> 01:15:49.768
Let's go to your car.
There's something you have to see.

01:15:49.809 --> 01:15:50.852
- Something about my car.
- In your car.

01:16:06.159 --> 01:16:09.120
That's a handy little
attitude adjuster.

01:16:21.758 --> 01:16:23.969
Damn. I'm boxed in.

01:16:47.242 --> 01:16:50.537
- What's it say?
- Nothing.

01:16:50.579 --> 01:16:52.998
Let's go play this back.

01:16:57.294 --> 01:17:01.590
- Give us the tape right now.
- I'm just tryin' to get my car back.

01:17:01.631 --> 01:17:03.675
Shut the fuck up.

01:17:03.717 --> 01:17:06.887
- Give him the tape.
- It's in my case.

01:17:06.928 --> 01:17:09.764
I'm gonna open my case.

01:17:10.015 --> 01:17:12.559
Facing us, so we can see it.

01:17:24.988 --> 01:17:27.574
Take it and turn her loose, OK?

01:17:27.616 --> 01:17:29.701
Yeah. Absolutely.

01:17:56.937 --> 01:18:00.690
"Oh, no. No.
We're not being followed, Lenny."

01:18:00.732 --> 01:18:02.442
"Don't be paranoid."

01:18:34.474 --> 01:18:36.268
Shit!

01:18:36.309 --> 01:18:40.897
- The glass is bullet-resistant.
- Whatever happened to bulletproof?

01:18:42.649 --> 01:18:44.025
Shit!

01:18:44.067 --> 01:18:46.319
Calm down. This is what I do.

01:18:52.409 --> 01:18:54.494
Hang on!

01:19:21.688 --> 01:19:22.981
Christ.

01:19:52.969 --> 01:19:54.596
Shit!

01:19:58.475 --> 01:20:00.810
God damn it. 911 is busy.

01:20:00.852 --> 01:20:02.729
It's all right, Lenny.

01:20:02.771 --> 01:20:04.940
They'd never make it in time.

01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:15.742
It won't open!
Oh, you're crazy.

01:20:40.475 --> 01:20:41.518
Oh, God!

01:20:43.687 --> 01:20:46.857
- This is bad.
- The gas tank's gonna go any second.

01:20:53.321 --> 01:20:55.323
Hold on.

01:21:06.710 --> 01:21:09.170
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:21:09.212 --> 01:21:11.840
The fire is out, isn't it?

01:21:17.304 --> 01:21:19.389
Get in here, Lenny.

01:21:19.431 --> 01:21:21.474
Come on! Move it! Move!

01:21:41.453 --> 01:21:43.872
Get ready to hold your breath.

01:21:43.914 --> 01:21:47.292
Just kick out hard
and follow me, OK?

01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:04.017
Let's get out of here.

01:22:17.531 --> 01:22:21.660
I can't believe you had to give
them the damn tape.

01:22:21.701 --> 01:22:23.912
Yeah. Me neither.

01:22:23.954 --> 01:22:26.081
It was one of my favorites.

01:22:26.122 --> 01:22:29.251
Me and Faith in the hot tub
on my birthday.

01:22:32.128 --> 01:22:34.214
Are we impressed yet?

01:22:34.256 --> 01:22:36.341
Yeah.

01:22:36.383 --> 01:22:38.468
Pretty impressed.

01:22:38.510 --> 01:22:41.680
# Here we kitty come, come,
here we kitty come, come... #

01:22:41.721 --> 01:22:45.684
Well, I'm missing the party of the
century, hauling your asses around...

01:22:45.725 --> 01:22:50.146
- Hey, Curtis. Just drive, all right?
- This shit is wack.

01:22:50.188 --> 01:22:53.316
- Those two guys were cops.
- You sure?

01:22:53.358 --> 01:22:57.529
It's the walk. Anyway, they'll get
your address. We got to keep moving.

01:22:59.614 --> 01:23:03.368
#... that crawls through the cracks,
you love that red, white... #

01:23:03.410 --> 01:23:06.246
What you doing all wet?

01:23:06.288 --> 01:23:09.833
What's up? Zander, we're going
to Aunt Cecile's house.

01:23:09.875 --> 01:23:12.836
- We'll see the fireworks from there.
- Aw, Ma.

01:23:12.878 --> 01:23:15.005
Come on, boy. Chop chop.

01:23:15.046 --> 01:23:19.009
Come on, Zander.
We're going for a ride, OK?

01:23:24.055 --> 01:23:28.185
- I want to know what's going on.
- Get in the car, Cecile...

01:23:28.226 --> 01:23:30.312
- What's goin' on?
- Now.

01:23:46.661 --> 01:23:49.789
Yo, what's up? How y'all doing?

01:23:51.416 --> 01:23:53.919
- Yo, Mace. What's up?
- Hey, Ronnie.

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:57.255
- You never come around here no more.
- I'm working, brother.

01:23:57.297 --> 01:24:00.258
- This is Lenny. He's with me.
- What's up?

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:03.887
- Watch the fireworks, baby.
- How you guys doing?

01:24:07.974 --> 01:24:10.101
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:24:10.143 --> 01:24:12.229
Good seeing you.

01:25:08.159 --> 01:25:10.245
Tell me.

01:25:10.287 --> 01:25:12.372
I can't tell you.

01:25:12.414 --> 01:25:15.625
- You gotta see it.
- I'm not doing it.

01:25:15.667 --> 01:25:20.463
I know what you think about
the wire, but you gotta see it.

01:25:20.505 --> 01:25:22.591
It's that important.

01:25:33.560 --> 01:25:35.645
OK?

01:25:42.319 --> 01:25:45.447
I'm sorry this has to be
your first playback.

01:25:48.033 --> 01:25:51.536
It's all right. Keep your eyes
closed, or you'll see double.

01:25:57.250 --> 01:26:00.879
Mm, baby, yes!

01:26:02.005 --> 01:26:06.468
I wanna thank you, Jeriko!
I owe you one for this, my brother.

01:26:06.509 --> 01:26:09.804
You owe me two,
you bastard. That's right!

01:26:09.846 --> 01:26:13.183
I owe you three,
four, five, and six!

01:26:13.225 --> 01:26:15.310
Hey, baby.

01:26:16.353 --> 01:26:18.813
What you doin' back there?

01:26:20.649 --> 01:26:23.610
Yes. Yes. Yes.
Oh, yeah, baby.

01:26:25.153 --> 01:26:28.532
Lights! Damn. Look at this, man.

01:26:28.573 --> 01:26:32.702
- Oh, god damn, man!
- Hey, just be cool, Jeriko. Yo.

01:26:32.744 --> 01:26:37.082
Slow down.
I'm not speeding, man.

01:26:37.123 --> 01:26:40.877
Man, what's the matter?
A black man can't own no jeep, huh?

01:26:40.919 --> 01:26:44.172
Pull all the way
to the foot of the ramp.

01:26:44.214 --> 01:26:45.882
No problem.

01:26:45.924 --> 01:26:49.594
You know how it is.
If we be cool, they gonna be cool.

01:26:49.636 --> 01:26:51.846
I can't afford no trouble.

01:26:51.888 --> 01:26:53.974
I'm upset.

01:26:55.517 --> 01:26:57.978
A man can't do shit in this town.

01:26:58.019 --> 01:27:02.774
I ain't going back, Iris. I don't
give a fuck. I ain't going back.

01:27:02.816 --> 01:27:05.694
Driver,
step out of the vehicle.

01:27:05.735 --> 01:27:10.490
Get down on your knees. Put
your hands behind your head... now!

01:27:10.532 --> 01:27:13.660
Everyone else,
out of the car.

01:27:17.873 --> 01:27:21.585
Damn, man. What the hell
you pull me over for?

01:27:21.626 --> 01:27:24.045
If I went slower,
I'd have been parked.

01:27:24.087 --> 01:27:27.549
Get down on your knees,
put your hands behind your head.

01:27:28.466 --> 01:27:30.552
Put your hands on
the hood of the car.

01:27:30.594 --> 01:27:32.721
Don't move. You, too.

01:27:32.762 --> 01:27:37.517
I suppose you had suspects fitting
our description in the area.

01:27:37.559 --> 01:27:42.814
Is that it? What was the description?
Two black males in a car?

01:27:42.856 --> 01:27:44.482
Right

01:27:44.524 --> 01:27:46.776
Ow! Fuck!

01:27:46.818 --> 01:27:51.156
You know what? You pulled over the
wrong black male tonight, officer...

01:27:51.198 --> 01:27:53.950
What is it? Steckler.
Officer Steckler!

01:27:53.992 --> 01:27:56.369
I'm that 800-pound
gorilla in your mist.

01:27:56.411 --> 01:28:00.081
I make more money in a day
than you make in a whole year.

01:28:00.123 --> 01:28:02.209
My lawyer loves spending my money

01:28:02.250 --> 01:28:05.587
dragging Aryan, Robocop fuckers
like you into court.

01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:09.090
Get a man down on the ground
with no probable cause.

01:28:09.132 --> 01:28:11.593
- Shut the fuck up.
- He didn't...

01:28:11.635 --> 01:28:14.095
Shut up and get back over there!

01:28:14.137 --> 01:28:17.057
- You all right, man?
- Motherfucker kicked me, man.

01:28:17.098 --> 01:28:20.602
- It's that rap-ass.
- You're that rapper puke.

01:28:20.644 --> 01:28:22.437
Jeriko One?

01:28:22.479 --> 01:28:26.858
You're the one that's been getting
all the gangbangers together,

01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:29.277
forming citizen groups,

01:28:29.319 --> 01:28:32.280
trying to rake the LAPD
over a cheese grater?

01:28:32.322 --> 01:28:35.825
Yeah. That's right.
And you gonna be in my next song.

01:28:35.867 --> 01:28:38.286
It's gonna be called Robo-Steckler.

01:28:38.328 --> 01:28:42.290
It's all about a cop
who met his worst nightmare,

01:28:42.332 --> 01:28:47.504
a nigger with enough political juice
to scrunch his ass like a stink bug.

01:28:47.546 --> 01:28:51.633
- You gonna be famous, fucker!
- I don't think so.

01:28:54.803 --> 01:28:57.055
Stop that bitch!

01:28:58.473 --> 01:29:00.559
Oh, no!

01:29:01.893 --> 01:29:05.188
- Get her!
- Oh, no. Fuck.

01:29:17.617 --> 01:29:19.828
There she goes! Get her!

01:29:23.915 --> 01:29:26.001
You bitch!

01:29:48.940 --> 01:29:51.026
Hang on. Hang on, Max.

01:29:53.069 --> 01:29:54.404
Mace.

01:29:55.614 --> 01:29:57.699
You see?

01:29:59.284 --> 01:30:01.161
You had to see it.

01:30:01.203 --> 01:30:05.540
I see the world opening up
and swallowing us all.

01:30:05.582 --> 01:30:07.667
Yeah. I know.

01:30:09.336 --> 01:30:11.004
Max, are you there?

01:30:11.046 --> 01:30:14.174
Meet me at Tick's in half an hour.
And, Lenny...

01:30:14.216 --> 01:30:16.301
Don't get pulled over, OK?

01:30:18.094 --> 01:30:20.847
Do you know what this tape could do
if it got out?

01:30:21.348 --> 01:30:24.100
Yeah, I got a pretty good idea.

01:30:24.142 --> 01:30:26.353
People finding out...

01:30:27.521 --> 01:30:29.189
seeing...

01:30:30.148 --> 01:30:34.152
that the LAPD just flat-out
executed Jeriko One.

01:30:35.111 --> 01:30:36.988
Jesus.

01:30:38.198 --> 01:30:39.658
Jesus.

01:30:41.535 --> 01:30:45.830
- Maybe they ought to see.
- Maybe.

01:30:45.872 --> 01:30:48.792
But tonight's probably not
the best night.

01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:01.096
Mace... Come on. We're rolling.

01:31:09.187 --> 01:31:14.067
I don't think those cops did Iris.
Whoever Iris wore for killed her.

01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:15.902
- Why?
- To break the trail.

01:31:15.944 --> 01:31:17.988
If those cops had gotten her,

01:31:18.029 --> 01:31:22.033
they'd have found out who she was
wearing for and gone after them.

01:31:22.075 --> 01:31:27.122
Our killer is as scared as we are,
which makes him really dangerous,

01:31:27.163 --> 01:31:29.207
judging by how scared I am.

01:31:32.168 --> 01:31:34.379
Move it up.

01:31:43.597 --> 01:31:45.724
Let her go.

01:31:59.613 --> 01:32:02.324
Sounds like Tick's
already celebrating, huh?

01:32:02.365 --> 01:32:07.412
- You're overdressed for this party.
- I want to look nice for you, Lenny.

01:32:07.621 --> 01:32:10.457
Hey, Tick. I gotta talk to you.

01:32:30.644 --> 01:32:32.938
He's been cooked off.

01:32:34.064 --> 01:32:35.607
- Is he dead?
- No.

01:32:35.649 --> 01:32:38.068
But his frontal lobes
are like runny eggs.

01:32:38.109 --> 01:32:43.198
They use an amplifier to boost
the signal, and it fries his brain.

01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.116
Tick!

01:32:46.701 --> 01:32:48.161
It's Lenny!

01:32:48.203 --> 01:32:50.247
Hey, Tick! Come on!

01:32:50.288 --> 01:32:52.666
Tick, it's me, Lenny!

01:32:52.707 --> 01:32:55.377
Come on. Wake up. Tick!

01:32:55.418 --> 01:32:57.128
Come on!

01:32:57.170 --> 01:33:00.006
Come on, Tick! Come on!

01:33:00.048 --> 01:33:03.218
He's totally cut off
from the outside world.

01:33:03.260 --> 01:33:05.971
How long does it last?

01:33:06.012 --> 01:33:07.305
Forever.

01:33:08.807 --> 01:33:11.476
Those psycho cops are on
a slash-and-burn

01:33:11.518 --> 01:33:14.020
to find the tape
and cover their tracks.

01:33:14.062 --> 01:33:16.147
Since Tick is a duplicator,

01:33:16.189 --> 01:33:19.651
they wanna find out if copies were
made or who wired Iris.

01:33:19.693 --> 01:33:23.196
It's not even homicide,
since he's technically alive.

01:33:23.238 --> 01:33:26.199
Yeah. That's right.
He's technically alive.

01:33:26.241 --> 01:33:29.286
It seems sophisticated.
These are not subtle guys.

01:33:29.327 --> 01:33:32.831
- There's more to this.
- What do you mean?

01:33:33.915 --> 01:33:39.379
All I'm saying is, you don't know how
high up the food chain this goes.

01:33:39.421 --> 01:33:42.048
- I heard stuff.
- What stuff?

01:33:42.090 --> 01:33:46.720
I heard stuff, smoke, rumors.
I've heard stuff.

01:33:46.761 --> 01:33:49.973
I've heard stuff
about a death squad.

01:33:50.015 --> 01:33:54.519
They're a group of guys, cops,
loyal to the hard-line school.

01:33:54.561 --> 01:33:58.440
Guys who've had too many years
of City Hall, review boards,

01:33:58.481 --> 01:34:01.359
and the goddam media
pissing down their necks,

01:34:01.401 --> 01:34:04.070
suspending cops, tying their hands,

01:34:04.112 --> 01:34:08.241
while these same people
are squealing, "Save us! Save us!

01:34:08.283 --> 01:34:11.703
"Do something, you morons.
Crime is out of control."

01:34:16.625 --> 01:34:21.254
- Bullshit. It's conspiracy paranoia.
- It's not about if you're paranoid.

01:34:21.296 --> 01:34:23.798
It's about whether
you're paranoid enough.

01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.842
Christ.

01:34:25.884 --> 01:34:27.761
Exactly. Get religion.

01:34:27.802 --> 01:34:29.930
I love you like my own blood, Lenny,

01:34:29.971 --> 01:34:32.390
but don't walk near me in public.

01:34:32.432 --> 01:34:36.144
The only card we got is the tape.
Get it to the media.

01:34:36.186 --> 01:34:37.938
Right.

01:34:37.979 --> 01:34:41.942
You run that on the news, by midnight
you got the biggest riot ever.

01:34:41.983 --> 01:34:44.069
They'll see the smoke from Canada.

01:34:44.110 --> 01:34:47.030
What are you saying?
Pretend it didn't happen?

01:34:47.072 --> 01:34:49.407
- I didn't say that.
- It happened.

01:34:49.449 --> 01:34:52.035
The LAPD executed
an important black man.

01:34:52.077 --> 01:34:54.704
Who are you to try to bury it?

01:34:54.746 --> 01:34:58.583
...trying to rake the LAPD
over a cheese grater?

01:34:58.625 --> 01:35:02.671
You want blood running waist-deep
in the storm drains, go do it.

01:35:02.712 --> 01:35:07.384
200,000 gangbangers will burn this
city to the fucking ground, Mace.

01:35:07.425 --> 01:35:11.304
Once the fire starts, the cops'll
cap off anything that moves.

01:35:11.346 --> 01:35:13.598
It'll be an all-out war.

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:14.975
I don't think so.

01:35:15.016 --> 01:35:17.227
Maybe it's time for a war.

01:35:17.269 --> 01:35:20.981
You really want that
on your head, Mace, huh?

01:35:21.022 --> 01:35:23.108
Really?

01:35:23.692 --> 01:35:28.572
Whoever did Iris did Tick.
It's the same sick wirehead shit.

01:35:28.613 --> 01:35:30.949
It's the same reason
to burn the trail.

01:35:30.991 --> 01:35:33.535
If Faith knows anything about this,

01:35:33.577 --> 01:35:35.453
- and she does...
- Somebody's going to kill Faith?

01:35:38.123 --> 01:35:40.417
# Yeah, you're not rid of me

01:35:40.458 --> 01:35:44.421
# No, you're not rid of me

01:35:44.462 --> 01:35:48.550
# I'll make you lick my injuries

01:35:48.592 --> 01:35:50.802
# I wanna twist your head off, see?

01:35:50.844 --> 01:35:56.266
# Till you say don't you wish
you never, never met her?

01:35:56.308 --> 01:35:59.769
# Don't you, don't you wish
you never, never met her?

01:36:00.020 --> 01:36:03.565
# Don't you, don't you wish
you never, never met her?

01:36:03.815 --> 01:36:07.068
# Don't you, don't you wish
you never, never met her?

01:36:07.319 --> 01:36:11.114
# Don't you, don't you wish
you never, never met her?

01:36:11.364 --> 01:36:15.285
# Don't you, don't you wish
you never, never met her?

01:36:15.327 --> 01:36:19.956
# Don't you, don't you wish
you never, never met her? #

01:36:34.554 --> 01:36:37.516
Jesus, Lenny, you scared
the fuck out of me!

01:36:37.557 --> 01:36:40.393
- What do you want?
- We know about Jeriko.

01:36:40.435 --> 01:36:45.857
- Iris gave me a copy of the tape.
- I wanted to keep you out of this.

01:36:45.899 --> 01:36:49.653
- How did it happen?
- Why was Iris with Jeriko, wired up?

01:36:49.694 --> 01:36:52.197
Faith, listen...
Look at me. Look at me.

01:36:52.239 --> 01:36:55.200
You gotta trust us.
We're here to help you.

01:36:55.242 --> 01:36:58.161
All right. I'll talk to you alone.

01:36:58.203 --> 01:37:00.789
- Mace is in this.
- Tell us.

01:37:02.541 --> 01:37:03.792
Faith.

01:37:07.587 --> 01:37:11.132
Philo, he's gotten
obsessed with playback.

01:37:11.174 --> 01:37:13.426
He's a total wiretrip junkie.

01:37:13.468 --> 01:37:17.514
He's such a control freak now,
he's been having people followed,

01:37:17.556 --> 01:37:19.933
recording his business partners'
calls,

01:37:19.975 --> 01:37:22.060
wiring up people left and right.

01:37:23.728 --> 01:37:25.814
Philo and Jeriko weren't getting on.

01:37:25.856 --> 01:37:28.900
He was afraid Jeriko would dump him,
but he wasn't sure,

01:37:28.942 --> 01:37:31.027
so he starts with the surveillance.

01:37:31.069 --> 01:37:33.864
A couple of nights ago,
he wires up Iris,

01:37:33.905 --> 01:37:39.286
and he sends her and the other girl,
Diamanda, over to Jeriko's table.

01:37:41.496 --> 01:37:43.373
Hi, baby.

01:37:43.415 --> 01:37:45.876
Hi. My name is Iris.

01:37:45.917 --> 01:37:47.961
Hey.

01:37:48.003 --> 01:37:50.297
I got a present for you.

01:37:50.338 --> 01:37:52.716
And it's so beautiful.

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:58.430
So that night, Iris calls up crying.
She's freaking out.

01:37:58.471 --> 01:38:01.016
She comes over
and she plays the tape.

01:38:01.057 --> 01:38:05.353
Philo loses it. He can't believe
the disaster she's gotten him into.

01:38:05.395 --> 01:38:08.440
'He's afraid the cops
will beat it out of her

01:38:08.481 --> 01:38:12.068
'who she's been working for,
and then come looking for him.'

01:38:14.738 --> 01:38:17.032
Why not go public,
save himself that way?

01:38:17.073 --> 01:38:21.203
If it got out he spied on his own
artists he'd lose all his other acts,

01:38:21.244 --> 01:38:23.371
and it'd be over for him.

01:38:45.018 --> 01:38:47.187
'So he gives Iris some money.'

01:38:47.229 --> 01:38:51.399
He tells her to check into a hotel
under an assumed name

01:38:51.441 --> 01:38:55.070
- until he can figure out what to do.
- He figured it out, all right.

01:38:55.111 --> 01:38:58.240
- You think he killed her?
- The killer knew where she was

01:38:58.281 --> 01:39:00.367
because he put her there.

01:39:01.201 --> 01:39:03.245
What a nightmare.

01:39:03.286 --> 01:39:06.623
I don't know where the fuck she is,
but we're late. Let's go.

01:39:06.665 --> 01:39:11.253
Philo, how do you want me to work it
tonight at the Bonaventure?

01:39:11.294 --> 01:39:13.505
Downstairs, or upstairs at the suite?

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:14.881
Lenny.

01:39:14.923 --> 01:39:17.884
Leave here with me right now.

01:39:19.761 --> 01:39:20.804
Come on.

01:39:20.846 --> 01:39:24.558
- We'll talk about that later.
- No, man. I need to know.

01:39:24.599 --> 01:39:28.436
Joey, what the fuck you waiting for?
Get her. Go!

01:39:28.478 --> 01:39:31.273
I just say things once, baby, OK?

01:39:31.314 --> 01:39:33.942
So, we will talk about that... later.

01:39:33.984 --> 01:39:37.279
Oh, OK, man. I'm cool. I'm cool.
I'm sorry, man.

01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:39.865
Hey, Wade, go out for a pass, bro.

01:39:43.493 --> 01:39:45.745
# Blue sky

01:39:46.913 --> 01:39:51.710
# No white clouds
in my blue sky #

01:40:01.803 --> 01:40:04.973
- Oh, shit!
- Get out of my fuckin' way!

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:09.269
Come on! Come on!

01:40:09.311 --> 01:40:12.022
Lenny! Go! Go!

01:40:14.941 --> 01:40:17.277
Pardon me! Sorry! Sorry!

01:40:17.319 --> 01:40:19.654
Get out of my fuckin' way! Move it!

01:40:19.696 --> 01:40:20.822
Move!

01:40:20.864 --> 01:40:22.324
Faith.

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:25.368
Hello, Lenny, you fuck!

01:40:28.371 --> 01:40:31.166
Let's go, darling. Happy New Year!

01:40:41.593 --> 01:40:44.179
- Get out of the way!
- Lenny...

01:40:44.221 --> 01:40:47.390
Excuse me. Get out of my fucking way!

01:40:50.894 --> 01:40:54.189
Vita... Vita, not now, baby.

01:40:54.231 --> 01:40:56.691
Come on. Not here.

01:41:19.548 --> 01:41:21.424
There he is.

01:41:21.466 --> 01:41:24.678
Mr. Gant, a few questions, sir?

01:41:36.481 --> 01:41:39.442
Well, I'm certainly
in the mood for a party

01:41:39.484 --> 01:41:43.238
- Wade, take her up to the suite.
- No problem.

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:47.450
You go and have a glass
of champagne... or six.

01:41:47.492 --> 01:41:51.663
See you up there in a bit,
help you ring in the new year.

01:41:54.708 --> 01:41:56.793
I live for the moment.

01:41:58.378 --> 01:42:01.214
Pussy-whipped,
sorry-ass motherfucker.

01:42:01.256 --> 01:42:03.133
Take it easy.

01:42:03.216 --> 01:42:06.011
So... So where are they now?

01:42:06.052 --> 01:42:08.972
He's got her up in
the room, under guard.

01:42:09.014 --> 01:42:11.808
Uh, he's still working the party,

01:42:11.850 --> 01:42:14.186
acting smooth like nothing's nothing.

01:42:14.227 --> 01:42:16.897
So, buddy... I say we work a trade.

01:42:16.938 --> 01:42:19.482
- What do you mean?
- Give him the clip.

01:42:19.524 --> 01:42:22.861
The tape for Faith.
I know he'll go for it.

01:42:22.903 --> 01:42:26.072
This is what we laughingly
refer to as a plan?

01:42:26.114 --> 01:42:28.200
Just get your butt down here.

01:42:28.241 --> 01:42:32.746
If I'm not downstairs, go to
the room. It's 2203. You writing?

01:42:32.787 --> 01:42:36.082
2-2-0-3.

01:42:36.124 --> 01:42:39.085
If he gives us any shit...
we kill them all.

01:42:39.127 --> 01:42:42.255
What do you say?
Really scatter the pigeons.

01:42:42.297 --> 01:42:44.758
We got to get over there.

01:42:44.799 --> 01:42:47.928
Can you borrow a dress
from Cecile or something?

01:42:47.969 --> 01:42:50.764
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean?

01:42:50.805 --> 01:42:54.100
- Gant's going to do her right there.
- Shut up.

01:42:54.142 --> 01:42:58.313
Lenny, park your mouth and listen.
It's a set-up. Think about it.

01:42:58.355 --> 01:43:00.440
Why is he sending tapes to you?

01:43:00.482 --> 01:43:04.069
To freak you, get you to rush in,
put a bullet in you, one in her,

01:43:04.110 --> 01:43:08.448
- and the gun in your hand?
- Yeah, that sounds right. I'm going.

01:43:08.490 --> 01:43:11.868
You going to get yourself killed
for this? Huh?

01:43:11.910 --> 01:43:13.995
For this toxic-waste bitch?

01:43:14.037 --> 01:43:16.248
What the fuck are you doing?

01:43:21.253 --> 01:43:24.798
This is your life!
Right here! Right now!

01:43:24.839 --> 01:43:28.468
It's real time, you hear me?
Real time!

01:43:28.510 --> 01:43:32.305
Time to get real, not playback.
You understand me?

01:43:32.347 --> 01:43:34.432
She doesn't love you anymore.

01:43:34.474 --> 01:43:37.519
Maybe she did once,
but she doesn't now.

01:43:37.561 --> 01:43:40.564
These are used emotions.

01:43:40.605 --> 01:43:43.024
It's time to trade them in.

01:43:43.066 --> 01:43:45.735
Memories were meant to fade, Lenny.

01:43:45.777 --> 01:43:49.489
They're designed that way
for a reason.

01:43:52.576 --> 01:43:55.787
Have you ever been in love with...

01:43:55.829 --> 01:43:59.165
someone who didn't return that love?

01:44:00.292 --> 01:44:02.377
Yeah, Lenny...

01:44:03.169 --> 01:44:05.630
I have.

01:44:05.672 --> 01:44:09.217
Didn't stop you from
loving them, right?

01:44:09.259 --> 01:44:14.097
Or being able to understand them
or forgive them?

01:44:16.349 --> 01:44:18.435
I guess.

01:44:19.561 --> 01:44:24.774
Didn't stop you from wanting
to protect them... did it?

01:44:33.283 --> 01:44:36.703
When I met Faith,
she was just another...

01:44:36.745 --> 01:44:38.830
another runaway...

01:44:38.872 --> 01:44:41.791
giving $20 blow jobs to buy crank.

01:44:43.668 --> 01:44:46.004
Just another lost soul.

01:44:47.923 --> 01:44:51.760
And she had this voice that was...

01:44:51.801 --> 01:44:53.887
Well, that was scary.

01:44:55.013 --> 01:44:58.850
Like she could take all the hurt
and rage of the entire world

01:44:58.892 --> 01:45:01.394
and lift it up to heaven
in one voice.

01:45:02.479 --> 01:45:05.232
I helped her.

01:45:05.273 --> 01:45:10.403
And I promised her that I'll always
just be there...

01:45:10.445 --> 01:45:12.531
to protect her.

01:45:15.242 --> 01:45:18.828
See, it's not about what's in
her head. It's about what's in mine.

01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:21.915
I can't let go of the promise.

01:45:22.582 --> 01:45:25.961
It's like it's all I have left.

01:45:37.097 --> 01:45:39.182
No, it's not.

01:45:51.778 --> 01:45:53.864
Come on.

01:45:54.656 --> 01:45:56.741
Let's go to a party.

01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:12.442
The end of the world, yeah!

01:47:16.696 --> 01:47:18.573
Shit!

01:47:19.241 --> 01:47:21.326
Let's bail.

01:47:28.083 --> 01:47:29.960
Hey, Mace...

01:47:30.001 --> 01:47:32.879
You look great in that dress.

01:47:32.921 --> 01:47:36.341
- I mean, better than I would.
- Thank you, I think.

01:47:36.383 --> 01:47:38.301
Come on, let's go.

01:48:03.869 --> 01:48:07.873
What's your plan for getting into
the most sold-out party in history?

01:48:07.914 --> 01:48:10.417
Relax, Mace. This is what I do.

01:48:29.561 --> 01:48:32.105
- You see Gant?
- Uh-uh.

01:48:41.823 --> 01:48:43.658
Shit.

01:48:53.668 --> 01:48:57.505
Come on, Max. Come on, buddy.

01:48:57.547 --> 01:48:59.341
Come on...

01:48:59.382 --> 01:49:03.303
'The customer you have called
is unavailable...'

01:49:03.345 --> 01:49:08.308
I still got one ace to play. Gant has
what I want, I have what he wants.

01:49:08.350 --> 01:49:10.602
This is the original.

01:49:10.644 --> 01:49:12.562
That's why it's a makable deal.

01:49:12.604 --> 01:49:16.274
Look, this tape is
a lightning bolt from God.

01:49:16.316 --> 01:49:18.944
It's worth more than you,
more than me,

01:49:18.985 --> 01:49:22.155
and more than Faith,
you understand?

01:49:22.197 --> 01:49:24.491
It can change things
that need changing

01:49:24.533 --> 01:49:26.785
before we all go off
the end of the road.

01:49:26.826 --> 01:49:30.080
You do not have the right
to use it for currency.

01:49:30.121 --> 01:49:33.542
So if you go... you go alone.

01:49:33.583 --> 01:49:38.296
You see, I care about you, Lenny,
a lot more than you know,

01:49:38.338 --> 01:49:41.466
which makes us both
pretty stupid, huh?

01:49:41.508 --> 01:49:45.262
But if you pawn this tape...

01:49:45.303 --> 01:49:48.139
you mean nothing to me.

01:50:02.445 --> 01:50:03.905
Excuse me.

01:50:05.115 --> 01:50:07.200
Excuse me.

01:50:14.916 --> 01:50:17.043
You see that guy over there?

01:50:17.085 --> 01:50:20.755
That's Deputy Commissioner
Palmer Strickland,

01:50:20.797 --> 01:50:22.883
the prick who busted me out.

01:50:22.924 --> 01:50:25.927
His ass is so tight,
only dogs hear his farts.

01:50:25.969 --> 01:50:28.597
If there's a clean cop, it's him.

01:50:28.638 --> 01:50:31.766
- Take it to him.
- You want me to trust a cop?

01:50:31.808 --> 01:50:34.728
No. Trust me. Here.

01:50:39.983 --> 01:50:42.068
What if you're wrong?

01:50:46.364 --> 01:50:48.074
Go.

01:50:56.541 --> 01:50:58.001
Excuse me.

01:51:19.648 --> 01:51:21.399
Commissioner...

01:51:21.441 --> 01:51:25.737
there's a clip in here
that you need to see right now.

01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:27.864
If it weren't New Year's Eve,

01:51:27.906 --> 01:51:31.409
I'd have you arrested for possession
of illegal equipment.

01:51:31.451 --> 01:51:33.912
You wanna know who killed Jeriko,

01:51:33.954 --> 01:51:36.206
you go into that stall
and hit "play."

01:51:36.248 --> 01:51:38.750
Sir, is there a problem here?

01:51:39.793 --> 01:51:42.295
- Damn it, I knew it.
- Come on, let's go.

01:51:42.337 --> 01:51:44.422
- Let go of me!
- Sir?

01:51:51.555 --> 01:51:55.058
Wade, can we talk here
like two human beings?

01:51:59.396 --> 01:52:01.273
It's nothing personal.

01:52:05.569 --> 01:52:07.654
Remember me, you fucking bitch?

01:52:09.155 --> 01:52:11.283
Come on! Come on!

01:52:21.710 --> 01:52:24.129
What are you looking at?

01:52:27.841 --> 01:52:29.426
God damn it!

01:52:33.013 --> 01:52:34.931
Enjoy the party.

01:53:01.124 --> 01:53:03.210
Steckler... Steckler!

01:54:42.309 --> 01:54:43.768
Fuck!

01:54:50.567 --> 01:54:52.652
I didn't hear you come in.

01:54:55.906 --> 01:54:57.365
Ah!

01:55:13.507 --> 01:55:14.966
No!

01:55:33.318 --> 01:55:35.320
No... no!

01:56:24.286 --> 01:56:26.162
Shit.

01:57:56.920 --> 01:57:58.296
OK?

01:58:02.551 --> 01:58:05.053
Did I hurt you?

01:58:05.095 --> 01:58:06.680
Huh?

01:58:06.721 --> 01:58:08.890
I love you, Max.

01:58:12.352 --> 01:58:14.396
You're so pretty, Faith.

01:58:14.437 --> 01:58:15.897
Shit!

01:58:15.939 --> 01:58:21.278
- Come here, you fucker...
- You want to fuckin' die?

01:58:21.319 --> 01:58:24.239
You want to fuckin' die?

01:58:24.281 --> 01:58:27.534
This piece of puke hired me
to kill you. Can you believe that?

01:58:27.576 --> 01:58:30.704
- Ain't that right?
- I can't believe this is happening.

01:58:30.745 --> 01:58:32.622
Believe it!

01:58:32.664 --> 01:58:35.208
Bring me the 'trodes
and the deck. Quick!

01:58:35.250 --> 01:58:39.212
Come here, big shot, suck on this.
You wanna suck on something?

01:58:39.254 --> 01:58:42.716
What are you gonna do?
You can't just kill him, Max!

01:58:42.757 --> 01:58:46.386
I'm not going to. Give me that.
Just a little poach job.

01:58:47.762 --> 01:58:50.265
You shut the fuck up!

01:58:50.307 --> 01:58:53.351
Shut up or I'll pull
this fucking trigger!

01:58:53.393 --> 01:58:55.770
Fuck!

01:58:57.647 --> 01:59:01.484
- Here's how much I love you, baby.
- God, Max!

01:59:01.526 --> 01:59:04.196
Hope you enjoy the show, Philo...

01:59:05.071 --> 01:59:07.157
you fuck.

01:59:09.034 --> 01:59:13.163
- Take it, you prick!
- No, Max, don't! Don't do it!

01:59:14.414 --> 01:59:17.209
Take it! Take it!

01:59:17.250 --> 01:59:18.710
Take it!

01:59:34.100 --> 01:59:38.063
Don't make any assumptions
about our friendship, OK, Lenny?

01:59:47.864 --> 01:59:50.700
I didn't know you
were color blind, Max.

01:59:50.742 --> 01:59:53.411
Only way I could stand your ties.

01:59:53.453 --> 01:59:55.539
Manos arriba, amigo.

01:59:58.041 --> 01:59:59.251
Ooh.

02:00:00.043 --> 02:00:02.337
Glock.23.

02:00:02.379 --> 02:00:04.047
Nice.

02:00:04.589 --> 02:00:07.843
- Where's Faith?
- I sent her to the party.

02:00:07.884 --> 02:00:12.180
- I'll wait here until you kill Gant.
- What makes you think I will?

02:00:12.889 --> 02:00:14.683
You just did.

02:00:14.724 --> 02:00:16.309
Jesus!

02:00:16.351 --> 02:00:19.479
You know, that's the second most
common word people say

02:00:19.521 --> 02:00:23.316
right before they die...
"shit" being number one.

02:00:23.358 --> 02:00:29.614
So... I killed Gant, then you ran in,
being on his payroll... and shot me.

02:00:29.656 --> 02:00:31.992
That's just about the way
it happened.

02:00:32.033 --> 02:00:34.452
Wait. I killed Iris, too, didn't I?

02:00:34.494 --> 02:00:38.164
They'll find the original
of her snuff clip in your apartment.

02:00:38.206 --> 02:00:40.792
The one I left at the club
was a copy.

02:00:40.834 --> 02:00:43.795
Was I a busy guy? Did I do Tick, too?

02:00:43.837 --> 02:00:46.506
- Oh, you bet. Did you like it?
- So, why, Max?

02:00:48.175 --> 02:00:51.136
- Why did you have to do Iris?
- Oh, picture it.

02:00:51.178 --> 02:00:54.639
I got to share this with somebody
cos it's just too perfect, OK?

02:00:54.681 --> 02:00:58.018
- I won't say anything.
- Oh, I know.

02:00:58.768 --> 02:01:03.940
I'm working for this puke who says
he'll pay me large to do the hooker.

02:01:03.982 --> 02:01:06.067
I also got to do his girlfriend

02:01:06.109 --> 02:01:08.653
cos she knows the score
and she's out of control.

02:01:08.695 --> 02:01:11.364
Only he doesn't know about
me and Faith.

02:01:11.406 --> 02:01:14.951
So I say to myself,
"If I turn the job down,

02:01:14.993 --> 02:01:19.331
"he'll get somebody else,
and I lose Faith," to coin a phrase.

02:01:19.372 --> 02:01:23.960
So to buy time, I do the skank,
but I still got to deal with Gant.

02:01:24.002 --> 02:01:29.090
It's him or me, but I can't cap him
without some chump to take the fall.

02:01:29.508 --> 02:01:34.054
And who better than his girlfriend's
loser ex-boyfriend...

02:01:34.095 --> 02:01:37.474
known criminal and who's been seen
hassling him in public?

02:01:37.516 --> 02:01:42.103
Who is, regrettably, also
your best fucking friend.

02:01:42.145 --> 02:01:44.064
No plan is perfect, Lenny.

02:01:44.898 --> 02:01:47.734
Cheer up, the world's gonna end
in ten minutes.

02:01:47.776 --> 02:01:49.861
You must be so pleased.

02:01:49.903 --> 02:01:53.615
I mean, I followed
your jelly bean trail right here,

02:01:53.657 --> 02:01:55.534
like a good little chump.

02:01:55.575 --> 02:01:58.245
- You got foggy on me a couple times.
- Oh?

02:01:58.286 --> 02:02:01.873
Remember the death squad? I had to
keep you from going to the cops.

02:02:01.915 --> 02:02:04.751
I've heard stuff
about a death squad.

02:02:04.793 --> 02:02:09.798
It's not about if you're paranoid.
It's whether you're paranoid enough.

02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:12.342
- So there never was a death squad.
- No.

02:02:12.384 --> 02:02:15.595
Just two loose cops running round
covering their butts.

02:02:15.637 --> 02:02:20.016
Zany, huh? All this shit
caused by a random traffic stop.

02:02:20.058 --> 02:02:22.853
Nothing means nothing, man.
You know that.

02:02:22.894 --> 02:02:25.313
Look around.
The planet's in fucking chaos.

02:02:25.355 --> 02:02:28.108
The day of reckoning is upon us!

02:02:28.149 --> 02:02:30.652
Get what you can while you can

02:02:30.694 --> 02:02:35.615
cos some shit can put a.22 in
the back of your head... any second.

02:02:38.743 --> 02:02:41.288
How'd you hook up with Faith?

02:02:41.329 --> 02:02:43.415
Hmm...

02:02:43.748 --> 02:02:47.836
This fuck hires me about a month ago
to eyeball her, only...

02:02:47.878 --> 02:02:49.963
Faith knows me from you.

02:02:50.005 --> 02:02:53.633
She comes up and says,
"Max, why are you following me?"

02:02:53.675 --> 02:02:57.554
And I say, "I'll buy you a drink.
I'll explain."

02:02:57.596 --> 02:02:59.764
And she says...

02:02:59.806 --> 02:03:01.892
Do you enjoy watching me?

02:03:03.602 --> 02:03:06.313
You're supposed to go
downstairs, baby.

02:03:06.354 --> 02:03:10.692
I know. I don't always do
what I'm told, Max, you know that.

02:03:10.734 --> 02:03:13.862
So I said, "Do you enjoy
watching me?"

02:03:13.904 --> 02:03:16.031
Come on, Max. Play with me.

02:03:16.072 --> 02:03:18.241
And then what did you say?

02:03:18.283 --> 02:03:21.328
I said I'd even do it for free.

02:03:21.369 --> 02:03:22.746
Uh-huh.

02:03:22.787 --> 02:03:27.250
I said, "That's good, because I like
the feeling of someone watching me."

02:03:27.292 --> 02:03:29.503
I acquired the taste from Lenny.

02:03:29.544 --> 02:03:35.133
Then she said, "Since we're gonna be
spending so much time together..."

02:03:35.175 --> 02:03:38.094
"Why don't we make the best of it?"

02:03:47.687 --> 02:03:49.773
The very best.

02:03:51.066 --> 02:03:54.402
You know all about that,
don't you, Lenny?

02:03:54.444 --> 02:03:58.990
Faith and me, we found a place
that you could never reach, Max.

02:03:59.032 --> 02:04:00.492
Never.

02:04:01.409 --> 02:04:04.955
Faith... I know it's gone...

02:04:06.706 --> 02:04:10.210
but you, Max,
you can't fucking touch it.

02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:12.754
Enjoy it.

02:04:13.213 --> 02:04:14.965
Lenny!

02:04:49.749 --> 02:04:52.544
Get off, you fucking bitch!

02:05:12.856 --> 02:05:14.065
God!

02:05:32.292 --> 02:05:34.294
Fuck you!

02:06:02.113 --> 02:06:04.741
What the fuck are you doing?

02:06:05.867 --> 02:06:07.953
You're coming with me!

02:06:18.797 --> 02:06:20.257
Ohh!

02:06:29.850 --> 02:06:31.935
Come here. Come here, Lenny!

02:06:31.977 --> 02:06:35.522
I'm taking you with me,
you motherfucker! Come here!

02:06:35.564 --> 02:06:38.400
Come here! You fuck!

02:06:42.362 --> 02:06:43.989
Come here!

02:07:25.864 --> 02:07:28.533
# They're selling Jesus again
they want your soul

02:07:29.659 --> 02:07:33.205
# And your money, your blood,
and your votes

02:07:33.246 --> 02:07:36.041
# They're selling Jesus again

02:07:36.082 --> 02:07:39.127
# Selling love to you

02:07:39.169 --> 02:07:43.882
# They're selling love, love

02:07:44.591 --> 02:07:48.053
# Love... #

02:07:48.261 --> 02:07:50.347
There she is!

02:09:09.801 --> 02:09:11.595
Freeze!

02:09:12.137 --> 02:09:14.222
I said, fucking freeze!

02:09:28.945 --> 02:09:31.573
Down! All the way down! Right now!

02:09:32.616 --> 02:09:34.701
Now pay attention, motherfucker!

02:09:36.119 --> 02:09:38.205
Stay down.

02:09:49.716 --> 02:09:51.885
Down! Down! Down! Down!

02:09:57.224 --> 02:10:00.852
Down now! You son of a bitch!
You ain't goin' anywhere!

02:10:00.894 --> 02:10:03.730
Shut up and move!
Get back! In a circle!

02:10:10.111 --> 02:10:12.155
Break this circle!

02:10:15.575 --> 02:10:17.619
Put that gun down!

02:10:17.661 --> 02:10:21.456
- Get on the ground now!
- Hold on. Hold on.

02:10:22.082 --> 02:10:25.877
I'll tell you what's going on here.
Let me tell you what's going on.

02:10:25.919 --> 02:10:29.130
Get on the ground now! Get down!

02:10:29.172 --> 02:10:31.550
Let me tell you what happened,
all right?

02:10:31.591 --> 02:10:34.094
Get on the ground now!

02:10:34.678 --> 02:10:36.763
All right?

02:10:42.602 --> 02:10:44.646
Get these fucking things off me!

02:10:44.688 --> 02:10:48.400
- No! Don't uncuff him!
- Shut up! Get down!

02:10:50.819 --> 02:10:54.322
Wait!
You don't know what happened!

02:10:54.364 --> 02:10:56.533
Fuck her up!

02:11:05.625 --> 02:11:07.711
Hit her! Hit her!

02:11:08.837 --> 02:11:11.131
Leave her alone!

02:12:44.307 --> 02:12:46.393
Commissioner Strickland!

02:12:46.434 --> 02:12:49.437
That is the cause of all this!

02:12:50.230 --> 02:12:52.440
Right fucking there!

02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:04.536
These two are under arrest
for murder!

02:13:05.954 --> 02:13:08.415
Read them their rights! Move it!

02:13:08.456 --> 02:13:10.041
Yes, sir.

02:13:10.083 --> 02:13:12.460
You have the right to remain silent.

02:13:12.502 --> 02:13:15.589
Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

02:13:15.630 --> 02:13:20.385
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney...

02:13:20.427 --> 02:13:23.847
Get this woman
some medical attention.

02:13:23.889 --> 02:13:26.183
Get some medical attention!

02:13:29.644 --> 02:13:31.730
Mace, are you OK?

02:13:31.771 --> 02:13:34.107
I got 'em.

02:13:46.870 --> 02:13:49.664
Get the fuck outta here! Everybody!

02:13:49.706 --> 02:13:51.791
Back the fuck up!

02:13:51.833 --> 02:13:53.835
Drop your weapon!

02:13:53.877 --> 02:13:56.046
Drop it now!

02:13:57.255 --> 02:13:59.216
No! NO!

02:14:00.759 --> 02:14:02.844
NO!

02:14:21.404 --> 02:14:24.407
Put that gun down!

02:14:24.449 --> 02:14:27.035
- Drop your weapon!
- Drop the gun now!

02:14:27.077 --> 02:14:29.746
Now! Drop it!

02:14:32.999 --> 02:14:35.585
- Put it down right now!
- Drop your weapon!

02:14:35.627 --> 02:14:37.712
Shoot!

02:14:37.754 --> 02:14:40.549
You fucking... nigger bitch!

02:15:01.069 --> 02:15:02.112
Lenny!

02:15:02.737 --> 02:15:04.030
Lenny!

02:15:04.072 --> 02:15:08.410
Lenny! Lenny!
No, no, Lenny, Lenny...

02:15:08.451 --> 02:15:10.662
Lenny! Lenny!

02:15:13.623 --> 02:15:15.458
Yeah?

02:15:15.500 --> 02:15:16.710
What?

02:15:32.058 --> 02:15:34.144
Are we under arrest?

02:15:34.186 --> 02:15:37.647
Nah, they just have to ask us
a few questions...

02:15:37.689 --> 02:15:39.774
for about six hours.

02:15:46.615 --> 02:15:49.201
OK, where are you hurt, sir?

02:15:49.242 --> 02:15:51.953
Ma'am, you OK? Ma'am?

02:15:51.995 --> 02:15:53.288
Yeah.

02:15:53.330 --> 02:15:57.042
We need to get that coat off you.
Hurt anywhere else?

02:15:57.083 --> 02:15:59.586
Ten! Nine!

02:15:59.628 --> 02:16:02.380
Eight! Seven!

02:16:02.422 --> 02:16:04.174
Six! Five!

02:16:04.216 --> 02:16:07.052
Four! Three!

02:16:07.093 --> 02:16:09.179
Two! One!

02:16:39.251 --> 02:16:41.920
You need an ambulance, sir.
Let's go this way.

02:16:41.962 --> 02:16:44.129
Go out this way, sir.

02:16:45.215 --> 02:16:47.634
Hey, Lenny. We made it.

02:16:52.013 --> 02:16:54.099
Yeah, we did.

02:17:00.397 --> 02:17:02.482
You should get going.

02:17:03.775 --> 02:17:06.736
Yeah. See you downtown.

02:17:06.778 --> 02:17:08.864
See you there.

02:17:10.323 --> 02:17:12.409
Make way.

02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:26.548
# Ah

02:17:30.177 --> 02:17:32.262
# Ah

02:17:34.181 --> 02:17:36.308
# Ah

02:17:40.812 --> 02:17:44.566
# Ah

02:17:54.659 --> 02:17:58.663
# Ah

02:18:03.793 --> 02:18:06.838
# It's in this moment

02:18:06.879 --> 02:18:10.424
# Hold on

02:18:10.467 --> 02:18:13.512
# When everything has come apart

02:18:16.764 --> 02:18:19.351
# It's in this moment

02:18:19.392 --> 02:18:21.895
# Right now

02:18:21.937 --> 02:18:24.981
# We can go together

02:18:28.567 --> 02:18:33.781
# Raise your sights

02:18:34.657 --> 02:18:38.495
# What's there to lose?

02:18:41.289 --> 02:18:43.791
# Fall in the light

02:18:44.084 --> 02:18:46.795
# Fall in the light

02:18:47.045 --> 02:18:52.424
# Fall in the light

02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:56.012
# Will you catch me?

02:18:56.054 --> 02:18:58.932
# Will you catch me?

02:18:58.974 --> 02:19:02.769
# Hold on, hold on, hold on

02:19:05.438 --> 02:19:07.315
# I know you'll catch me #
