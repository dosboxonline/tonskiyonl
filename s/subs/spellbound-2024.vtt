Give me.

34:18.208 --> 34:21.832
Why does everybody
keep eating all the important stuff?

34:21.833 --> 34:22.749
[grunts]

34:22.750 --> 34:25.250
- [Flink chitters]
- Hmm?

34:26.958 --> 34:29.415
- [fob continues pinging]
- [gasps]

34:29.416 --> 34:32.040
<i>I can't find it. I can't find it anywhere.</i>

34:32.041 --> 34:33.582
- The oracles!
- [Flink exclaims]

34:33.583 --> 34:37.249
<i>Calm down. Calm down.
Just retrace your steps.</i>

34:37.250 --> 34:39.207
- Hello?
<i>- Good idea. Uh...</i>

34:39.208 --> 34:40.457
<i>- We caught a frog--</i>
- Hello?!

34:40.458 --> 34:43.040
[exclaims] <i>Who's that?
Did you invite your mother again?</i>

34:43.041 --> 34:45.207
No. It's me, Princess Ellian.

34:45.208 --> 34:46.749
I have your magic fob.

34:46.750 --> 34:49.082
<i>See? I told you I didn't lose it.</i>

34:49.083 --> 34:52.165
Listen, things have gotten
really bad here.

34:52.166 --> 34:53.957
Please, I need you to come back.

34:53.958 --> 34:58.665
<i>Oh, no. We are not going
anywhere near that crazy place again.</i>

34:58.666 --> 35:01.749
- <i>Luno, she's in trouble.</i>
- What if I come to you?

35:01.750 --> 35:03.040
Will you help me then?

35:03.041 --> 35:05.915
<i>Ooh, you're very pushy for a princess.</i>

35:05.916 --> 35:09.333
<i>Oh, of course we will. Won't we?</i>

35:12.541 --> 35:16.082
<i>Oh, fine. But good luck
finding a frog at this hour.</i>

35:16.083 --> 35:17.832
<i>Use the fob, Princess.</i>

35:17.833 --> 35:21.499
<i>It'll bring you directly to our home
in the Dark Forest of Eternal Darkness.</i>

35:21.500 --> 35:24.290
[soldier] The order is given.
Move the monsters out.

35:24.291 --> 35:26.625
[gasps] Thank you both so much.

35:27.541 --> 35:29.457
[whimsical music playing]

35:29.458 --> 35:30.707
[frantic music playing]

35:30.708 --> 35:31.625
Soldiers!

35:32.208 --> 35:34.165
- Put down your weapons.
- [soldier] Princess?

35:34.166 --> 35:36.083
I said drop 'em.

35:38.250 --> 35:39.082
What the...?

35:39.083 --> 35:40.624
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

35:40.625 --> 35:43.707
- [soldiers groan]
- Guess we gotta be a bit more specific.

35:43.708 --> 35:46.207
Uh... Take us to the oracles.

35:46.208 --> 35:48.291
- [enchanted music playing]

35:49.541 --> 35:51.999
- [gasps]
- [growling]

35:52.000 --> 35:54.374
- [gasps]
- [soldier gasps] What's happening?

35:54.375 --> 35:57.915
I was really hoping for more of
a "zing and you're there" type of thing.

35:57.916 --> 35:59.416
[dramatic music playing]

36:01.083 --> 36:03.207
- Hey! Wait for us!
- [soldier] They're getting away!

36:03.208 --> 36:05.124
We need something. Uh...

36:05.125 --> 36:07.124
A... a carriage! A... a cart!

36:07.125 --> 36:08.249
Uh, something.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.333
[enchanted music playing]

36:13.583 --> 36:14.583
[panting]

36:15.375 --> 36:16.250
Oh!

36:18.375 --> 36:19.249
[cries out]

36:19.250 --> 36:20.333
[king growls]

36:27.083 --> 36:28.125
[monsters growl]

36:31.250 --> 36:33.250
They're stealing our princess.

36:35.875 --> 36:37.290
[Bolinar] Hurry! Hurry!

36:37.291 --> 36:38.749
Stop those monsters.

36:38.750 --> 36:40.250
Soldiers, follow me.

36:45.541 --> 36:46.416
[yells]

36:47.458 --> 36:48.291

37:02.958 --> 37:03.833
[woman gasps]

37:07.666 --> 37:09.749
Flink, here. Stall them.

Whoa!

37:32.458 --> 37:33.291
Hey!

37:33.958 --> 37:35.833
- [soldier] Wait!
- [soldier 2] Hey!

37:36.708 --> 37:37.708
[soldier 3] Whoa!

37:39.666 --> 37:41.125
Close the gates!

37:41.833 --> 37:43.166
[soldier] Close the gates!

37:47.875 --> 37:49.000
Oh no.

37:52.291 --> 37:53.582
Flink, hold the gate!

37:53.583 --> 37:54.958
[Flink exclaims]

[soldier 4] Whoa!

38:14.458 --> 38:15.416
[blowing horn]

38:21.416 --> 38:23.416
Whoa. [grunting and straining]

38:27.500 --> 38:28.333
Oh no.

38:29.750 --> 38:31.290
Hey, look alive.

[soldiers exclaim]

38:47.291 --> 38:48.208
[Cardona] Heel.

38:49.208 --> 38:51.208
Sit. Out of the-- [sighs]

38:51.833 --> 38:52.708
[whistles]

38:59.375 --> 39:00.624
- [Bolinar] Princess!
- [gasps]

39:00.625 --> 39:01.540
[squeaks]

39:01.541 --> 39:03.832
[Bolinar] We're trying to rescue you!

39:03.833 --> 39:06.749
No, thanks! I don't need to be rescued!

39:06.750 --> 39:08.207
Why won't she listen?

39:08.208 --> 39:09.874
Because she's a teenager.

39:09.875 --> 39:11.790
Now, just get her!

39:11.791 --> 39:13.124
[Bolinar cries out]

39:13.125 --> 39:14.624
[yelling]

39:14.625 --> 39:15.708
Ah!

39:17.541 --> 39:18.833
Flink? [gasps]

39:21.833 --> 39:23.249
[Bolinar grunts]

39:23.250 --> 39:24.540
[Ellian] Oh no.

39:24.541 --> 39:26.207
Sorry, Bolinar!

39:26.208 --> 39:28.790
[Bolinar] Well, I should think so
after all you put me through.

39:28.791 --> 39:29.707
Bolinar?

39:29.708 --> 39:32.290
As your trusted counselor,
your esteemed mentor,

39:32.291 --> 39:34.124
I implore you to-- Whoa!

39:34.125 --> 39:36.749
What's that hairy thing?
And that hairy thing?

39:36.750 --> 39:37.665
[gasps]

39:37.666 --> 39:39.916
No!

39:42.541 --> 39:46.333
Oh, wait. If I'm in this body,
who's in my body?

39:48.083 --> 39:49.208
[sniffs]

39:50.875 --> 39:52.416
[chitters softly]

39:55.416 --> 39:56.625
[exclaims]

39:57.166 --> 40:00.124
[Bolinar] Oh! No. No, no, no, no, no!

40:00.125 --> 40:03.165
Ellian, you have to help me.
I'm a purple rat!

40:03.166 --> 40:05.457
Not at the top of my to-do list.

40:05.458 --> 40:06.957
[Bolinar] Oh, what am I gonna do?

40:06.958 --> 40:08.165
Get us out of here.

40:08.166 --> 40:09.415
[exclaims]

40:09.416 --> 40:11.500
[dramatic music playing]

40:14.333 --> 40:15.625
Whoa!

40:19.916 --> 40:21.583
- [monsters growl]
- [Ellian yelps]

40:23.041 --> 40:24.290
Whoa!

40:24.291 --> 40:26.625
[both screaming]

40:27.875 --> 40:28.707
Huh?

40:28.708 --> 40:30.833
[Ellian screams]

40:35.208 --> 40:36.165
[Ellian screams]

40:36.166 --> 40:37.500
- [Bolinar grunts]
- [Ellian sighs]

40:38.291 --> 40:39.374
[sighs]

40:39.375 --> 40:42.207
[gasps] Mom? Dad? You okay?

40:42.208 --> 40:43.250
[Bolinar] Well, I'm not.

40:44.166 --> 40:45.541
Thank you for asking.

40:46.125 --> 40:50.082
- [sighs] We did it. We made it.
- Well, bully for us.

40:50.083 --> 40:52.833
But meanwhile,
my body is back at the kingdom.

40:53.333 --> 40:54.874
No! No! No! Please, don't eat me.

40:54.875 --> 40:56.374
Don't worry, Bolinar.

40:56.375 --> 40:58.290
The oracles will fix everything.

40:58.291 --> 41:01.124
Well, how are supposed to find them?

41:01.125 --> 41:04.041
[sniffing] Wait, stop. What is that?

41:04.666 --> 41:05.707
I smell oregano.

41:05.708 --> 41:07.665
[sniffing] A dash of basil.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.749
A delicate sprinkling of rosemary.

41:09.750 --> 41:11.249
[sniffs] Oh!

41:11.250 --> 41:12.582
It's pasta fazool.

41:12.583 --> 41:17.124
Come on. Who would be cooking pasta
in the middle of the Dark Forest?

41:17.125 --> 41:18.415
Who? Who?

41:18.416 --> 41:19.832
[loud hoot]

41:19.833 --> 41:21.916
[enchanted music playing]

41:23.083 --> 41:24.583
[hooting]

41:28.541 --> 41:29.374
[gasps]

41:29.375 --> 41:30.958
[oracles laughing]

41:32.500 --> 41:33.958
[whimsical music playing]

41:35.208 --> 41:38.207
[Sunny] What do you think? Should we be
naughty and have garlic bread?

41:38.208 --> 41:41.790
[Luno] Well, we were eaten by a monster,
so I think we deserve it.

41:41.791 --> 41:44.749
[Sunny] Yay! Because I put it
in the oven 20 minutes ago.

41:44.750 --> 41:46.707
- [Luno] You're terrible.
- [knocking]

41:46.708 --> 41:48.708
[Sunny] Oh! Company!

41:49.416 --> 41:51.250
Ah, you're finally here.

41:52.541 --> 41:53.457
[screams]

41:53.458 --> 41:55.999
Ugh! She brought those monsters.

41:56.000 --> 41:57.540
[Sunny] We told her to come.

41:57.541 --> 42:00.040
It's not like she could
just hire a monster sitter.

42:00.041 --> 42:02.082
Princess, you made it.

42:02.083 --> 42:03.290
Whew. Barely.

42:03.291 --> 42:04.874
But here we are.

42:04.875 --> 42:09.540
And so sorry about the whole
"my mom eating you" situation.

42:09.541 --> 42:11.707
It won't happen again. Will it, Mother?

42:11.708 --> 42:12.958
[whimpers]

42:14.375 --> 42:16.250
So here's your fob.

42:17.125 --> 42:18.374
Go ahead.

42:18.375 --> 42:20.165
- Go ahead?
- Break the spell.

42:20.166 --> 42:22.332
Oh! No, sorry.

42:22.333 --> 42:25.790
The fob was just to get you here.
It can't change them back.

42:25.791 --> 42:27.790
- What?
- But you can, right?

42:27.791 --> 42:30.915
- I'm afraid it's not in our skill set.
- But you can change me back?

42:30.916 --> 42:33.415
Nuh-uh. You're a body switch.

42:33.416 --> 42:35.915
You're going to need
your other half to do anything.

42:35.916 --> 42:36.832
[sputters]

42:36.833 --> 42:38.915
Anyone you might know
who could help my parents?

42:38.916 --> 42:41.540
Like a wizard or a sorcerer or a pixie?

42:41.541 --> 42:44.790
A pixie? What,
you think we all know each other?

42:44.791 --> 42:48.082
Like we're all part
of some sort of magical mafia?

42:48.083 --> 42:49.165
Oh, sorry, I didn't mean--

42:49.166 --> 42:52.790
Though to be fair, there is
that pixie couple we play pinochle with.

42:52.791 --> 42:54.457
They're not very magical though.

42:54.458 --> 42:56.415
They're not very good
pinochle players either.

42:56.416 --> 42:58.040
[chuckles] Bless their hearts.

42:58.041 --> 43:00.957
So you're telling me
there's no one who can break this spell?

43:00.958 --> 43:02.582
We didn't say that.

43:02.583 --> 43:03.624
[Ellian] Well, then who?

43:03.625 --> 43:04.624
- Them.
- Them.

43:04.625 --> 43:06.708
[king growling]

43:07.250 --> 43:08.665
[chittering]

43:08.666 --> 43:11.540
Them? Are you cuckoo banana cakes?
Look at them.

43:11.541 --> 43:14.124
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

43:14.125 --> 43:17.207
So tell me what to do,
and I'll do it for them.

43:17.208 --> 43:20.540
That's not how these things work.
Only they can break the spell.

43:20.541 --> 43:21.457
How?

43:21.458 --> 43:25.165
Together, they get to embark
on an invigorating quest

43:25.166 --> 43:27.624
through the Dark Forest
of Eternal Darkness.

43:27.625 --> 43:28.874
But there's no path.

43:28.875 --> 43:30.374
There'll be lights to guide them.

43:30.375 --> 43:32.832
Mmm, some of the time.
They're very fickle.

43:32.833 --> 43:34.332
You're messing with us, right?

43:34.333 --> 43:38.457
- Discover pathways through mountains.
- With lots of unstable cliffs.

43:38.458 --> 43:41.290
- Ford new streams.
- Ha! More like deadly rapids.

43:41.291 --> 43:42.749
Glide across deserts.

43:42.750 --> 43:45.124
Oy, the heat. And it's not a dry heat.

43:45.125 --> 43:47.707
[Sunny] Princess! Wait!
You didn't let us finish.

43:47.708 --> 43:51.040
If what you're saying is true,
I'll never see my parents again.

43:51.041 --> 43:52.790
It's... it's hopeless.

43:52.791 --> 43:55.041
[poignant music playing]

43:56.583 --> 43:58.041
[sighs] Great.

43:58.708 --> 44:00.249
Oh, poor thing.

44:00.250 --> 44:03.875
Princess, it's never hopeless.
