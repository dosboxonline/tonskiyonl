00:28.529 --> 00:31.280
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

00:31.365 --> 00:32.573
Hey, guys.

00:52.845 --> 00:54.220
- Merry Christmas.
- Thanks.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.388
Hey!

00:55.472 --> 00:58.516
Ladies and gentlemen,
can I have your attention?

00:58.600 --> 01:02.311
This has been our best year ever
thanks to Do-it-All-For-You-Dolly.

01:03.814 --> 01:07.108
And I think we should give
a special thanks to the people

01:07.192 --> 01:09.944
responsible for our
record-breaking sales,

01:10.028 --> 01:13.656
our Midwest marketing
and distribution team,

01:13.741 --> 01:16.367
- Scott Calvin and Susan Perry!
- Yeah!

01:16.452 --> 01:20.830
Let's hear it for 'em! Come on!

01:20.914 --> 01:24.333
Susan, darling, come on up here.
Aren't they adorable?

01:24.418 --> 01:26.210
Say a few words.

01:27.004 --> 01:29.797
Thank you very much.
This was really a team effort.

01:29.882 --> 01:32.550
I would just want to thank every one
of you individually...

01:32.634 --> 01:34.218
But we don't have time for that, do we?

01:35.471 --> 01:37.930
In all seriousness, here at B&R Toys,

01:38.015 --> 01:41.267
we're not just about making
a profit in quality toys.

01:41.351 --> 01:46.272
We're also about families. But our
families aren't here with us right now.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.941
Which is probably why Johnson's
secretary is sitting in his lap.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.779
You guys
have a great party. Have a great year.

01:52.863 --> 01:55.072
Drive safe. Thanks very much.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.328
Aren't they wonderful?

02:03.749 --> 02:05.750
Laura, I was hoping to
catch you before you'd left your house.

02:05.834 --> 02:10.045
I ran real late today.
You wouldn't believe the traffic out here.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.632
Yeah, same to you!

02:12.716 --> 02:15.384
And that's not very ladylike!

02:15.469 --> 02:18.262
Anyway, I'll try to get
to my house as soon as I can.

02:18.347 --> 02:20.014
Oh. There's the problem right there.

02:20.098 --> 02:23.476
Three car pileup.
I'm really gonna be late.

02:23.560 --> 02:25.645
Hark, carol bells, sweet silver bells

02:25.729 --> 02:27.814
All seem to sing, throw cares away

02:27.898 --> 02:29.982
Christmas is here bringing good cheer

02:30.067 --> 02:32.068
To young and old, meek and the bold

02:32.152 --> 02:34.195
Ding dong and dong, balance in song

02:34.279 --> 02:36.239
Ring joyful ring, all caroling

02:36.323 --> 02:38.241
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer

02:38.325 --> 02:40.409
From everywhere, filling the air

02:40.536 --> 02:42.453
Oh, how they pound, raising the sound

02:42.538 --> 02:44.580
Go hand in hand, calling in the town

02:44.665 --> 02:46.541
Gaily they ring while people sing

02:46.625 --> 02:48.709
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

02:48.794 --> 02:52.839
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas

02:52.923 --> 02:54.841
On we will sing, dawn with a hymn

02:54.925 --> 02:57.009
Angel will come to every home

02:57.094 --> 02:59.011
Hark, carol bells, sweet silver bells

02:59.096 --> 03:01.055
All seem to sing, throw cares away

03:01.139 --> 03:03.015
Hark, carol bells, sweet silver bells

03:03.100 --> 03:05.184
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer

03:05.269 --> 03:07.019
From everywhere, filling the air

03:07.104 --> 03:09.230
Oh, how they pound, raising the sound

03:09.314 --> 03:11.315
Go hand in hand, calling in the town

03:11.400 --> 03:13.234
Gaily they ring while people sing

03:13.318 --> 03:15.069
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here

03:15.153 --> 03:19.448
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas

03:19.533 --> 03:21.325
On we will sing, dawn with a hymn

03:21.410 --> 03:23.411
Angel will come to every home

03:23.495 --> 03:25.705
On we will sing, dawn with a hymn

03:25.789 --> 03:28.791
Angel will come to every home

03:30.335 --> 03:33.629
Ding dong ding

03:33.714 --> 03:35.214
Dong

03:42.431 --> 03:44.557
All right, let's go.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.435
- Bye, Charlie.
- Bye, Neal.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.649
Oh! Sorry I'm late. Hi.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.902
- Hi.
- Did you want to come in for a minute?

03:55.986 --> 03:58.279
- Neal's waiting in the car, so...
- Why doesn't he come in?

03:58.363 --> 04:01.407
'Cause, Daddy, he says you'll just
end up saying something snotty.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.994
Not necessarily. Could be rude
or sarcastic. Whatever it takes.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.495
See? I gotta go.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.707
Come on, come on. Christmas Eve.
Just a minute.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.837
Watch those steps.
They're real slippery.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.339
Told ya.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.181
- So...
- Well...

04:27.434 --> 04:28.601
You going to your mom's
for dinner?

04:28.685 --> 04:30.603
Actually, we're gonna be with
Neal's family.

04:30.687 --> 04:32.355
Ah! Christmas at the pound.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.818
There aren't that many
presents over there.

04:37.903 --> 04:42.323
- That's because Santa isn't here yet.
- Neal doesn't believe in Santa.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.784
Well, Neal's head comes to a point.

04:44.868 --> 04:48.704
- He's smart. He's a doctor.
- He's not a doctor, he's a psychiatrist.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.915
Take your coat off.
You're sticking around, aren't ya?

04:53.543 --> 04:55.419
I'll be right there. Just a sec.

04:57.381 --> 04:58.965
- I just want to...
- Did that jerk tell Charlie

04:59.049 --> 05:00.800
there was no Santa Claus?

05:00.884 --> 05:05.805
What? No. Oh, Charlie came home
from school the other day in tears

05:05.889 --> 05:09.475
because some big kid told him
there was no such thing as Santa.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.811
And, you know Neal.
Well, he sat him down and...

05:11.895 --> 05:13.646
And told him
there was a Santa Claus.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.816
Well, all he said was that Santa
was more like a feeling.

05:16.900 --> 05:19.443
You know, more like a state of mind
than a person.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.320
Kind of like Neal.

05:21.405 --> 05:24.824
And who gave you permission
to tell Charlie there's no Santa Claus?

05:24.908 --> 05:28.327
I think if we're going to destroy our
son's illusions, I should be a part of it.

05:28.412 --> 05:29.495
Yeah, but you're never around,

05:29.579 --> 05:30.871
- are you, Scott?
- Oh, please.

05:30.956 --> 05:32.707
Listen,
all we are trying to do is give

05:32.791 --> 05:35.167
Charlie a firm grasp on reality.

05:35.252 --> 05:36.585
That's a good idea.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.838
You don't want kids running around
using their imaginations.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.631
Oh, yeah.
That's from the guy responsible

05:40.716 --> 05:42.591
- for the Do-It-All-For-You-Dolly.
- Leave her out of this.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.802
"Don't you burp me
Don't you change me, I'm the dolly..."

05:44.886 --> 05:47.179
Why do you guys always have to fight?

05:48.015 --> 05:50.141
We're not fighting.
It's your mom singing.

05:50.225 --> 05:51.892
It sounds a lot like fighting, doesn't it?

05:51.977 --> 05:53.561
Cats, even.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.563
The trouble is, Neal and your mom,

05:55.647 --> 05:58.149
they don't believe in Santa
because they were real naughty.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.776
Which is why they'll probably get
lumps of coal in their stockings.

06:00.861 --> 06:05.865
I don't know. It seems kind of babyish
to believe in that kind of stuff.

06:05.949 --> 06:09.201
What are you talking about?
I believe in Santa Claus. I'm not a baby.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.370
- Well...
- Maybe it's time you left.

06:11.455 --> 06:14.623
We don't want to keep
Dr. Pinhead waiting.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.794
Come here.

06:21.298 --> 06:23.257
Do I gotta stay?

06:24.634 --> 06:27.261
Listen, you and your daddy

06:27.345 --> 06:30.347
are gonna have
a great Christmas, okay?

06:30.432 --> 06:33.100
- Will you pick me up tomorrow?
- Of course.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.102
- Early?
- Yes.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.229
We're talking sunup, you're here?

06:39.149 --> 06:42.902
You'll be fine. Merry Christmas, Charlie.
I love you.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.571
I love you, too, Mom.

06:47.574 --> 06:51.410
- You be a good boy, okay?
- Bye, Mom.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.705
Four hours?

07:02.172 --> 07:05.174
I'm dreaming

07:05.300 --> 07:09.303
Of a white Christmas

07:09.387 --> 07:13.516
Your Christmas will be perfect...

07:13.600 --> 07:16.393
...with its own built-in turkey timer.

07:16.478 --> 07:20.272
Where those treetops glisten

07:20.357 --> 07:21.649
And now, we return you

07:21.733 --> 07:23.901
to the most cherished
of Christmas stories,

07:23.985 --> 07:28.781
Miracle on 34th Street, starring...

07:40.877 --> 07:42.044
Ah.

07:43.672 --> 07:47.133
That is exactly why you want
a high-quality fire extinguisher

07:47.217 --> 07:48.467
right in the kitchen.

07:48.552 --> 07:50.970
Those flames were really big, Dad.

07:51.054 --> 07:53.514
Well, turkey's funny that way.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.558
Dad!

08:06.069 --> 08:07.736
It's done!

08:09.906 --> 08:13.159
You like osso buco, Charlie?

08:13.243 --> 08:17.830
- They're closed.
- You know, Neal's a real good cook.

08:17.914 --> 08:21.167
Yeah, and you should
see him walk on water.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.002
You don't like him
very much, do you, Dad?

08:23.086 --> 08:26.172
Charlie, yeah. I was joking, okay?
I'm sorry. I was just kidding around.

08:26.256 --> 08:29.842
I like him a lot... Yeah, sure, I like him.
You know, there...

08:29.926 --> 08:33.053
There's just something about him
that makes me wanna...

08:33.138 --> 08:34.638
Lash out irrationally.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.183
Where did you hear that?

08:37.267 --> 08:41.227
From Neal. I learn a lot from him.
He listens to me.

08:41.313 --> 08:43.898
Yeah. Then he charges you for it.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.950
I'm dreaming

08:55.035 --> 08:58.412
Of a white Christmas

08:58.496 --> 09:02.374
All right. Denny's. It's always open.

09:02.459 --> 09:05.044
I don't wanna eat here.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.378
What're you talking about?

09:06.463 --> 09:09.340
Everybody likes Denny's.
It's an American institution.

09:18.350 --> 09:20.643
- Are you with Hatsutashi?
- No.

09:20.727 --> 09:24.980
- Dad burned the turkey.
- Oh, yeah. This way. Come on.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.362
- Right over there.
- Thank you.

09:41.206 --> 09:43.999
- Here we go.
- Burn the turkey?

09:47.003 --> 09:48.462
Coffee?

09:48.546 --> 09:50.965
No, thank you, Judy.

09:52.300 --> 09:56.512
What do you say we start out
with cold glasses

09:56.596 --> 09:59.306
of delicious seasonal favorite eggnog?

10:00.850 --> 10:03.602
- I don't like eggnog.
- We're out.

10:03.687 --> 10:06.063
- Coffee. Decaf.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:06.147 --> 10:09.066
- I'll have chocolate milk, please.
- We're out.

10:09.818 --> 10:11.568
Plain milk's fine.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.320
Okay.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.239
At least we know they got hot apple pie.

10:15.323 --> 10:17.408
- We did.
- Mmm-hmm.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.544
This is nice.

10:33.341 --> 10:36.468
"And Mama in her kerchief
and I in my cap

10:36.553 --> 10:39.138
"had just settled down
for a long winter's nap.

10:39.222 --> 10:41.724
"When out on the lawn
there arose such a clatter,

10:41.808 --> 10:44.310
"I sprang from my bed
to see what was the matter.

10:44.394 --> 10:48.022
"Away to the window I flew like a flash.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.691
"With a miniature sleigh and St. Nick...

10:50.775 --> 10:53.610
"And Prancer and Dancer...

10:53.695 --> 10:56.739
"...and to all a good night."

11:03.997 --> 11:06.832
What's that?

11:06.916 --> 11:09.668
- What's what?
- "A Rose Suchak ladder"?

11:09.753 --> 11:13.547
It's not a ladder.
I said, "Arose such a clatter."

11:13.631 --> 11:16.800
- It means, "Came a big noise."
- What?

11:19.262 --> 11:23.349
Charlie, "arose" is a word
that means "it came,"

11:23.433 --> 11:25.851
and "clatter" is a big noise.

11:25.935 --> 11:27.394
Now please, go to sleep.
Shut your eyes.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.066
How do reindeer fly?
They don't have any wings.

11:32.150 --> 11:35.569
- Fairy dust.
- That's from Peter Pan, Dad.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.864
- Horns.
- Antlers.

11:38.948 --> 11:42.701
Whatever. Their antlers give them...

11:42.786 --> 11:44.870
You know, there's a slipstream effect.

11:44.954 --> 11:47.873
The air goes... They move...
They're weightless.

11:47.957 --> 11:51.210
But if Santa's so fat, how did
he get down the chimneys?

11:51.294 --> 11:53.003
He sucks it in like Grandpa.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.713
What about people
who don't have fireplaces?

11:54.798 --> 11:55.881
How does he get into their house?

11:55.965 --> 12:00.469
Charlie, sometimes believing
in something means you...

12:03.098 --> 12:04.973
Means you just believe in it.

12:05.058 --> 12:08.352
Santa uses reindeer to fly because
that's how he has to get around.

12:09.062 --> 12:12.189
But you do believe in Santa, right, Dad?

12:13.900 --> 12:17.903
Of course I believe in Santa.
Now please, go to sleep.

12:25.203 --> 12:26.328
Dad?

12:27.330 --> 12:28.539
What is it, Charlie?

12:28.623 --> 12:33.043
Maybe you better leave some cookies
and milk out, just in case, okay?

12:33.128 --> 12:37.131
Great. I'll just go preheat the oven.

12:37.215 --> 12:41.009
And don't forget
the fire extinguisher.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.470
Good night, Charlie.

12:58.361 --> 13:00.529
Ho!

13:02.866 --> 13:04.783
Settle down there.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.963
Dad! Dad!

13:19.382 --> 13:23.135
- What?
- I heard a clatter!

13:23.219 --> 13:24.219
What, Charlie?

13:24.304 --> 13:25.888
There! A clatter.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.975
- Charlie, what're you talking about?
- You know, "It came a big noise"?

13:30.059 --> 13:34.146
- It's coming from outside!
- Charlie, it's just the wind or something.

13:34.230 --> 13:37.191
Come on, let's go back to bed.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.696
- Somebody's on the roof.
- Maybe it's Santa.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.825
Not now, Charlie. I want you to sit here,
and I want you to stay right there.

13:48.703 --> 13:52.623
- Charlie, do you know how to call 911?
- Sure. 911.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.710
Yeah, great. Stay there.

14:09.933 --> 14:10.933
Hey, you!

14:11.309 --> 14:12.559
Oops! Whoa!

14:13.603 --> 14:15.187
Whoa, whoa!

14:15.271 --> 14:16.813
Whoa!

14:34.040 --> 14:35.624
Whoo-hoo!

14:36.709 --> 14:38.210
Hey, buddy.

14:38.294 --> 14:44.007
All right. You should just stay still.
Perfect.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.053
You got him!

14:48.137 --> 14:52.057
Charlie, stay where you are. Charlie,
would you listen to me? Stay up there!

14:52.141 --> 14:55.727
It is Santa! You killed him.

14:55.812 --> 14:58.564
Did not! It is not Santa.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.233
Well, he was.

15:03.361 --> 15:04.736
He's got some ID on him, I bet.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.073
Fella, if you can hear me, I'm just
looking for your identification.

15:08.157 --> 15:10.659
Once I figure out who you are,
I'll give you a lift back to the mall.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.581
"If something should happen to me,
put on my suit.

15:15.665 --> 15:19.209
"The reindeer will know what to do."
Yeah, right.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.141
Whoa.

16:03.296 --> 16:04.630
Dad!

16:06.716 --> 16:08.717
- Hey.
- He disappeared!

16:09.385 --> 16:10.552
Whoa.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.013
He's naked somewhere.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.724
You gonna put on the suit
like the card said?

16:15.808 --> 16:16.850
- Are you?
- No. No.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.644
Come on, Dad. I wanna go, too.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.812
Stop it, Charlie.
We're not going anywhere.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.022
You never do what I wanna do!

16:22.106 --> 16:24.900
Would you please be quiet for a minute
so I can figure this out?

16:27.278 --> 16:29.446
Reindeer up on the roof.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.531
Santa suit laying on the ground.

16:31.616 --> 16:34.076
Guy fell. Not my fault.

16:35.745 --> 16:39.414
Reindeer on the roof.
That is hard to explain.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.707
It's the ladder.

16:44.754 --> 16:47.589
Where the hell'd this come from?

16:48.424 --> 16:52.094
Look here, Dad.
"The Rose Suchak Ladder Company."

16:52.387 --> 16:53.428
Huh?

16:53.846 --> 16:56.682
"Out by the roof
there's a Rose Suchak ladder."

16:56.766 --> 16:59.810
- Just like the poem.
- Just like the poem?

17:01.229 --> 17:03.939
Charlie, come on down from there.
Charlie, get down from there!

17:04.022 --> 17:07.651
Dad! You gotta see this!

17:07.734 --> 17:10.194
- Don't touch anything.
- It's great!

17:10.279 --> 17:12.698
I'm just gonna call the police.
I'll carry this stuff up there.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.199
Let them deal with it, okay?

17:17.453 --> 17:18.787
Whoa.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.664
This guy was huge.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.333
Dad, isn't this neat?

17:23.417 --> 17:27.253
Charlie. Charlie!
Stay away from those things.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.464
They're reindeer.
You don't know where they've been.

17:29.549 --> 17:33.009
They all look like they've got
key lime disease.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.682
Easy, Rudolph.

17:42.145 --> 17:44.187
Excuse me. Comet.

17:44.272 --> 17:47.232
Dad! Check out Santa's sleigh!

17:47.316 --> 17:49.735
There's no such thing as Santa's sleigh.

17:49.819 --> 17:53.029
Sure there is.
You said you believed in Santa.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.282
- Right?
- I did? I do!

17:55.366 --> 17:57.075
What about the reindeer?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.453
These are Santa's reindeer,
aren't they?

17:59.912 --> 18:01.496
I hope not.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.124
These are

18:06.210 --> 18:07.544
a gift.

18:08.796 --> 18:12.048
Probably from the cable company.

18:12.133 --> 18:15.051
We're getting the Disney Channel now.
Merry Christmas.

18:15.136 --> 18:18.555
- Now, hop out of there, please.
- I don't wanna go.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.766
Listen, Charlie, I'm not kidding.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.184
Let's go!

18:24.979 --> 18:25.979
Yeah, let's go!

18:33.654 --> 18:34.946
Charlie!

18:35.865 --> 18:38.825
Hold on, Charlie!

18:41.954 --> 18:43.455
Whoa!

18:46.876 --> 18:50.545
Giddyap, Comet! Whoa, let's go!

18:53.549 --> 18:55.425
Dad, climb up here.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.929
There we go.

18:59.013 --> 19:02.933
So, if we go straight
on this road and we hit I-94...

19:22.411 --> 19:25.997
Well, we made good time.
Now what do we do?

19:26.082 --> 19:28.708
- Get the bag of toys!
- And do what?

19:28.793 --> 19:32.003
- Go down the chimney.
- Down the chimney!

19:32.088 --> 19:34.840
You want me to take the toys
down the chimney

19:34.924 --> 19:38.009
into a strange house in my underwear?

19:38.094 --> 19:41.179
No. You got to put the suit on first.

19:41.264 --> 19:44.641
You know what we're gonna do,
is we're gonna get out of here

19:44.725 --> 19:48.395
because this whole thing is stupid.

19:48.479 --> 19:51.648
How come everything
I want to do is stupid?

19:55.820 --> 19:57.821
I didn't say that.

20:13.754 --> 20:18.508
Freezing my nubs off out here, and you
want me to get into a Santa costume.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.886
This is great. A Santa costume.

20:20.970 --> 20:25.098
Oh, this thing.
You never know where it's been.

20:25.182 --> 20:27.392
A thousand malls.

20:27.476 --> 20:32.105
Well, I hope you're happy, Comet.
Hope you're happy. But most of all,

20:32.189 --> 20:35.609
I hope the guy that lives here is a tailor!

20:35.693 --> 20:38.194
Nice coat.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.949
Well, how do I look? Nice?

20:43.034 --> 20:45.744
- You forgot the sash.
- You're right.

20:45.828 --> 20:48.246
This completes the ensemble.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.584
All right. Got my boots.

20:52.668 --> 20:55.879
Now I've got the suit on. How am I
supposed to know what to leave?

20:55.963 --> 20:57.422
Maybe there's a list.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.842
A list. How silly of me.
Of course there's a list.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.431
Careful, Dad!

21:07.600 --> 21:11.478
- I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay!
- Look! You're flying!

21:11.562 --> 21:14.314
It's okay, I'm used to it.
I lived through the '60s.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.650
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:02.530 --> 22:03.697
Nice teeth.

22:07.410 --> 22:08.743
Who's down there?

22:12.248 --> 22:14.082
It's the holidays. Come on, come on.

22:17.920 --> 22:21.756
Hey, Charles!
Need a little help down here!

22:24.760 --> 22:25.844
Whoa!

22:25.928 --> 22:29.222
How'd you do that?
What'd it feel like, Dad?

22:29.306 --> 22:31.725
It felt like America's Most Wanted!

22:32.768 --> 22:35.186
Now pull me in, quick!
We gotta get outta here.

22:36.814 --> 22:39.983
Thanks. We gotta go home.
How do you start this thing?

22:40.401 --> 22:41.943
Just like that!

22:48.284 --> 22:49.576
Whoa.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.788
This could be a really long night.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.166
Do it again, Dad.

22:56.250 --> 22:57.625
Please?

22:58.836 --> 23:01.171
I can't. That thing's empty.

23:03.966 --> 23:05.508
There's nothing in the bag.

23:06.761 --> 23:09.304
Even if there was,
didn't you notice there's no chimney?

23:09.388 --> 23:10.805
Where there's no chimney,
there's no fireplace.

23:13.142 --> 23:15.018
Are you growling at me?

23:16.771 --> 23:21.691
Look, Comet, like I said,
there is nothing left...

23:22.276 --> 23:26.905
That's so weird, because I know when
I did that... No, no, no, no, no!

23:26.989 --> 23:30.283
Hold it! There's no chimney here!

23:30.367 --> 23:32.368
Can you hear me?
No chimney, all right?

23:32.453 --> 23:35.038
Looking good, Dad!

23:35.122 --> 23:37.582
You have got to be kidding!

23:37.666 --> 23:40.251
Come on! Look at the size of this thing!

23:53.015 --> 23:54.349
Weird! Ow.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.740
- Santa?
- Scott Calvin.

24:11.242 --> 24:13.576
How come your clothes are so baggy?

24:13.661 --> 24:18.414
Because Santa is watching
his saturated fats.

24:18.499 --> 24:22.085
- How come you don't have a beard?
- Because I shaved!

24:23.087 --> 24:26.089
Do you want this doll or not?
Go back to sleep.

24:33.013 --> 24:35.306
You're supposed to drink the milk.

24:35.391 --> 24:38.101
Look, I am lactose intolerant.

24:38.185 --> 24:43.439
And I am just about this close to taking
all those presents back up the chimney.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.694
"Supposed to drink the milk"!

24:49.363 --> 24:50.905
Shut your eyes!

24:52.408 --> 24:53.700
Oh!

24:58.080 --> 24:59.747
How do you get in
without a fireplace?

24:59.832 --> 25:00.874
I don't know.

25:00.958 --> 25:03.668
- One just kind of appeared.
- Awesome!

25:12.219 --> 25:13.761
Oh, boy!

25:54.386 --> 25:58.056
Charlie, look at the clouds over here.
Aren't they pretty?

25:58.140 --> 25:59.474
Charlie!

26:15.115 --> 26:16.324
Yah!

26:25.918 --> 26:28.878
All right. Morning, fellas.

26:28.963 --> 26:32.757
Morning, sport. We're done, Comet.
Ho-ho-ho.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.093
Back to the house.

26:35.177 --> 26:38.513
Merry Christmas to all
and to all a good night.

26:38.597 --> 26:41.683
When I wake up,
I'm getting a CAT scan!

27:02.204 --> 27:03.788
Is this okay, Dad?

27:04.873 --> 27:07.375
No, it's not okay!

27:07.459 --> 27:11.421
Hey, does this look like
home to you guys?

27:12.131 --> 27:13.798
No, no! No, no, no, no!

27:13.882 --> 27:17.302
Hey, hey! Where you going?
Come back here!

27:17.469 --> 27:18.845
Oh.

27:26.478 --> 27:31.024
In the silence of the night

27:31.692 --> 27:33.359
When the snow...

27:33.444 --> 27:36.654
Hey, hey! Hey, buddy!

27:36.739 --> 27:39.699
You, sir! Hey!

27:39.783 --> 27:41.576
You can see a magic light

27:41.660 --> 27:45.913
And hear the ring of Christmas bells

27:46.040 --> 27:47.373
Can you hear me?

27:47.541 --> 27:51.878
Though the night seems long and dark

27:51.962 --> 27:54.213
It is the earth...

27:54.298 --> 27:57.008
- What's that?
- I don't know.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.635
I think it's the North Pole.

27:59.720 --> 28:01.929
That's the North Pole?

28:02.014 --> 28:04.015
Hey, buddy, we need some help.

28:04.099 --> 28:07.935
Hello! What are you doing?

28:08.020 --> 28:12.648
So close your eyes and come with me

28:13.776 --> 28:19.197
The Christmas bells
will bring you home

28:40.260 --> 28:42.804
Hey, look!
Here comes the new Santa!

28:42.888 --> 28:46.224
And now with song we fill the night

28:46.308 --> 28:49.394
While magic dances in the light

28:49.478 --> 28:52.563
To wish you now and all the year

28:52.648 --> 28:55.233
The joy that comes
with Christmas cheer

28:55.317 --> 28:56.401
Sit back.

28:56.485 --> 28:58.986
Hear our voices fill the air

28:59.071 --> 29:02.156
To drive the winter's cold away

29:02.241 --> 29:05.743
And so our hearts with all will share

29:05.828 --> 29:12.375
The love that comes
with Christmas day

29:12.459 --> 29:17.672
The Christmas bells
will bring you home

29:25.764 --> 29:29.434
- Where are all the grownups?
- This is so cool!

29:29.518 --> 29:31.436
Stay here.

29:31.520 --> 29:34.939
Hey, kid, kid.
Kid, who's in charge here?

29:35.023 --> 29:36.858
You are.
And I'm not a kid.

29:36.942 --> 29:40.903
I've pointy shoes that are
older than you. I'm an elf.

29:40.988 --> 29:43.781
You guys, or you girls.

29:43.866 --> 29:45.366
Who gives the orders?
Who's your boss?

29:45.451 --> 29:47.368
- You are.
- No, no, no.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.704
- Who's the head elf?
- You are!

29:49.788 --> 29:52.248
Hey! Who's causing
all the trouble around here?

29:52.332 --> 29:53.708
- He is.
- She is.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.127
Excuse me, are we on a coffee break?

29:56.211 --> 29:59.714
- We don't drink coffee.
- Then I guess the break is over.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.133
Back to work. Thanks.

30:02.217 --> 30:05.052
Take it easy on her, will ya?
Who are you?

30:05.137 --> 30:08.139
I'm Bernard. Nice to meet ya, Santa.

30:08.223 --> 30:10.766
I'm not Santa! I've had a rough night.

30:10.851 --> 30:12.810
There's been dogs barking,
guns going off.

30:12.895 --> 30:14.395
Look, my back's killing me.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.230
Have you ever tried to shove
a sea kayak down a chimney?

30:16.315 --> 30:17.648
I'm tired of this small talk.

30:17.733 --> 30:18.733
Hmm.

30:19.234 --> 30:22.445
The other Santa disappeared, right?

30:23.113 --> 30:26.657
Wait a minute. Hey!
I know where this is going.

30:26.742 --> 30:29.911
It wasn't my fault. The other guy fell.
It was an accident.

30:29.995 --> 30:32.997
I've got homeowner's insurance
and a good attorney.

30:33.081 --> 30:36.167
Not as good as my wife's,
but let's not open up that wound.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.295
Hold it a minute.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.130
How did you know the other guy
was gone?

30:41.215 --> 30:44.133
- Can I get you a drink?
- No, I don't want a drink.

30:44.218 --> 30:46.677
I'm thirsty, and hungry, too.

30:46.762 --> 30:49.013
Charlie, I thought I told you
to stay in the sleigh.

30:49.097 --> 30:50.223
Who's this?

30:51.725 --> 30:53.184
This is my son, Charlie.

30:53.769 --> 30:56.020
I'm sorry. Charlie, this is...

30:56.104 --> 30:57.688
- Bernard.
- Bernard.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.815
- Hi, Bernard.
- Hiya, sport.

31:00.651 --> 31:02.109
Hey, Dad, he called me "sport"

31:02.194 --> 31:03.861
- just like you.
- Wonderful.

31:03.946 --> 31:06.656
Hey, you know what?
I got something for you.

31:06.740 --> 31:09.700
Okay, now hold out
your hand, all right?

31:09.785 --> 31:14.163
Now, be very careful.
This is very old, just like me.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.668
Shake it up, Charlie.

31:30.639 --> 31:32.056
Wow.

31:32.140 --> 31:36.394
Why don't you hold onto it for me
for a while? It might come in handy.

31:36.478 --> 31:39.897
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

31:40.816 --> 31:43.317
I promise I'll take real good care of it.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.861
Make sure you do.

31:45.946 --> 31:48.322
I will.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.533
Hey, Dad, look!

31:52.411 --> 31:55.329
Fabulous ball. Hey, Barabbas.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.206
- Bernard!
- Bernard.

31:57.291 --> 31:59.750
Can we take a direct flight
back to reality

31:59.835 --> 32:01.419
or do we have to change planes
in Denver?

32:01.503 --> 32:03.337
Larry, take Charlie here
and get him some chow.

32:03.422 --> 32:04.797
No, Larry, don't do that. Charlie!

32:04.881 --> 32:07.675
He'll be okay. Follow me,
you'll want to get out of those clothes.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.678
I... No, look, Barnaby,
I just want to go home.

32:35.329 --> 32:38.080
Look, I am not Santa Claus!

32:38.874 --> 32:40.041
Ah.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.460
Did you or did you not read the card?

32:42.544 --> 32:44.795
- Yeah, I read the card.
- Then you're the new Santa.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.340
In putting on the hat and jacket,
you accepted the contract.

32:47.424 --> 32:49.091
What contract?

32:49.176 --> 32:51.636
The card in the Santa suit.
You said you read it, right?

32:51.720 --> 32:54.889
So when you put on the suit,
you fell subject to the Santa Clause.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.474
- Here.
- The Santa Claus?

32:56.558 --> 32:58.392
You mean the guy that fell off my roof?

32:58.477 --> 33:01.937
No, no, no. Not Santa Claus the person,
Santa Clause the clause.

33:02.022 --> 33:03.439
What?

33:04.441 --> 33:05.650
Look, you're a businessman, right?

33:05.734 --> 33:06.734
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:06.818 --> 33:09.904
A clause,
as in the last line of a contract.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.157
You got the card?

33:14.159 --> 33:16.661
Okay, look.

33:16.745 --> 33:19.789
The Santa Clause, "In putting on
this suit and entering the sleigh,

33:19.873 --> 33:22.500
"the wearer waives any and all
rights to any previous identity,

33:22.584 --> 33:23.584
"real or implied,

33:23.669 --> 33:26.087
"and fully accepts the duties
and responsibilities

33:26.171 --> 33:28.339
"of Santa Claus in perpetuity

33:28.423 --> 33:30.966
"until such time that wearer
becomes unable to do so

33:31.051 --> 33:34.512
- "by either accident or design."
- What does that mean?

33:34.596 --> 33:36.806
It means you put on the suit,
you're the big guy.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.182
That's ridiculous.
I didn't put on a suit just to...

33:38.266 --> 33:40.309
Try to understand this!

33:40.519 --> 33:41.602
Ooh.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.606
Let me explain something to you, okay?

33:45.691 --> 33:47.775
Toys have to be delivered.
I'm not gonna do it.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.694
It's not my job. I'm just an elf.

33:49.778 --> 33:53.030
It's Santa's job, but Santa
fell off a roof, your roof.

33:53.115 --> 33:54.865
You read the card, you put on the suit.

33:54.950 --> 33:56.534
That clearly falls under
the Santa Clause.

33:56.618 --> 33:58.953
- Now you're Santa, okay?
- A question.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.830
- What?
- When can I get outta here?

34:00.914 --> 34:03.040
Dad, you gotta see this place!

34:03.125 --> 34:04.417
You leave tomorrow morning.

34:04.501 --> 34:06.210
You have 11 months
to get your affairs in order,

34:06.294 --> 34:08.045
and you're due back here
Thanksgiving.

34:08.130 --> 34:09.505
I'm not coming back here
on Thanksgiving.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.799
I'll ship the list to your house.

34:11.882 --> 34:15.136
- What list?
- Come on, now. The list.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.641
He's making a list

34:20.726 --> 34:22.560
Checking it twice

34:22.643 --> 34:26.397
Gonna find out
who's naughty or nice

34:26.481 --> 34:28.815
Ugh. Look, you put a "P" next
to the kids who are nice

34:28.900 --> 34:30.359
and a "C" next to the naughty ones.

34:30.444 --> 34:31.694
"P" and "C"?

34:31.777 --> 34:34.739
Yeah! "P" for present,
"C" for coal, right, Bernard?

34:34.822 --> 34:36.072
Right!

34:36.158 --> 34:37.699
Wait a minute!
How do I know who's good and bad?

34:37.784 --> 34:40.911
- You'll know.
- What if I don't wanna do this?

34:40.996 --> 34:44.081
- Don't even kid about a thing like that!
- Why not?

34:44.166 --> 34:46.542
What if I don't buy into this
Santa Claus thing?

34:46.710 --> 34:49.335
What if I choose not to believe it?

35:00.849 --> 35:05.603
Then there would be millions of
disappointed children around the world.

35:05.687 --> 35:10.316
You see, children hold the spirit
of Christmas within their hearts.

35:11.777 --> 35:14.820
You wouldn't want to be responsible
for killing the spirit of Christmas,

35:14.905 --> 35:18.240
now, would you, Santa?

35:20.619 --> 35:24.205
Judy will take you to your room. Get out
of the suit, it needs to be cleaned.

35:24.289 --> 35:26.707
- And taken in.
- Then get some sleep.

35:26.792 --> 35:30.753
We've got a lot of work to do
and only a year in which to do it.

35:38.345 --> 35:41.222
- Judy.
- Santa.

35:41.306 --> 35:43.891
- Scott Calvin.
- Follow me.

35:46.311 --> 35:48.062
I'll just take the next train.

35:48.146 --> 35:50.564
- Dad, come on!
- Charlie!

35:52.484 --> 35:54.652
Come on, Dad!

35:54.736 --> 35:56.737
Charlie, wait up!

35:58.698 --> 36:02.660
- That's funny. I like that.
- I like that, too. But I don't like...

36:16.174 --> 36:17.591
Wow.

36:24.558 --> 36:28.394
Can I get you anything?
The kitchen's always open.

36:28.478 --> 36:30.312
How about a stiff drink?

36:32.107 --> 36:34.108
You should get some sleep.

36:36.361 --> 36:39.280
Here are your pajamas.
I'll be right back.

36:46.246 --> 36:48.664
Look, Judy. Look over there.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.879
Look over there. I know.

36:54.963 --> 36:58.007
Look over there. There's a canoe.
Yeah, it's true.

36:59.384 --> 37:02.428
Look, there's an emu!

37:07.601 --> 37:09.518
- Look at him!
- Shoo!

37:13.440 --> 37:16.066
- Santa?
- Scott Calvin.

37:23.575 --> 37:27.328
- I brought you some cocoa.
- No, thanks.

37:27.412 --> 37:31.832
My own recipe.
Took me 1,200 years to get it right.

37:33.919 --> 37:36.629
- 1,200 years?
- That's right.

37:39.633 --> 37:43.886
You know, I must say,
you look pretty good for your age.

37:43.970 --> 37:47.264
Thanks, but I'm seeing someone
in wrapping.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.186
Okay.

37:52.354 --> 37:53.646
Mmm.

37:54.648 --> 37:55.814
Hmm.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.191
This is good.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.402
This is really good.

38:00.487 --> 38:05.616
Not too hot, extra chocolate,
shaken, not stirred.

38:08.328 --> 38:10.287
You look distressed.

38:10.372 --> 38:13.457
Distressed? I'm way past distressed.

38:13.541 --> 38:17.878
- Why's that?
- I'm talking to an elf!

38:17.963 --> 38:20.464
And I stopped believing
in Santa Claus a long time ago.

38:20.548 --> 38:24.468
That's not surprising.
Most grownups can't believe in magic.

38:24.552 --> 38:28.764
It just sort of grows out of them.

38:28.848 --> 38:31.809
Look, you're a nice little elf.

38:31.893 --> 38:34.311
- Thanks.
- But this is a dream.

38:34.396 --> 38:38.565
I mean, this is fabulous. Is that a polar
bear directing traffic down there?

38:40.193 --> 38:43.821
I see it, but I don't believe it.

38:43.905 --> 38:47.950
- You're missing the point.
- What is the point?

38:48.034 --> 38:50.744
Seeing isn't believing,
believing is seeing.

38:50.829 --> 38:54.748
Kids don't have to see this place
to know that it's here.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.584
They just know.

38:59.921 --> 39:03.924
Well, you should get some rest.
Good night, sir.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.170
Dad!

39:42.047 --> 39:43.630
Dad!

39:46.217 --> 39:48.135
Wake up, sleepy!

39:48.219 --> 39:50.137
Come on, get up!

39:51.973 --> 39:53.724
- Dad!
- Mmm.

39:54.142 --> 39:55.809
Dad!

39:56.144 --> 39:57.811
Dad!

39:58.605 --> 40:01.982
Come on, Dad, come on!

40:02.317 --> 40:04.276
See all the neat toys!

40:04.360 --> 40:06.570
- Stop shaking me, Charlie.
- Come on, get up, get up!

40:06.654 --> 40:09.114
- Okay.
- Come on, it's Christmas morning.

40:09.199 --> 40:12.493
- Great! Go make some coffee.
- Come on, Dad, let's go!

40:12.577 --> 40:14.328
Okay.

41:35.869 --> 41:38.912
- Are you okay, Dad?
- Yeah. Just fine, just fine.

41:38.997 --> 41:41.957
Are you having a heart attack?
I know CPR.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.334
No, I was just...

41:45.420 --> 41:48.839
- S.C.
- Yeah, Santa Claus.

41:48.923 --> 41:52.801
Hey. Same initials as your name, Dad.

41:52.886 --> 41:55.345
Scott Calvin.

41:55.430 --> 41:57.347
What?

42:01.936 --> 42:04.938
Oh, Charlie!
Merry Christmas, honey.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.691
- Did you have a good time?
- Great time! The best!

42:07.775 --> 42:12.821
Great. Scott, nice P.J.s. Very festive.

42:12.906 --> 42:15.657
- Where'd you get them?
- I don't know.

42:16.284 --> 42:17.826
Judy gave them to you.

42:17.911 --> 42:20.787
- Judy. Really.
- Who?

42:20.872 --> 42:24.374
- Up at the North Pole.
- Ah. One of Santa's little helpers.

42:24.459 --> 42:28.545
Last night, Dad and me
went with the flying reindeer.

42:28.630 --> 42:33.800
It was really neat, Mom. Dad was Santa,
and Larry showed me the workshop.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.552
You know,
where they make all the toys?

42:35.637 --> 42:36.929
Gee, thanks for

42:37.013 --> 42:39.640
- keeping his feet on the ground.
- You bet.

42:39.724 --> 42:43.185
Honey, you go wait in the car
for a minute. I'll be right there.

42:44.062 --> 42:45.229
Merry Christmas.

42:45.313 --> 42:47.981
Bye, Dad. Thanks for
a great night at the North Pole.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.736
So...

42:52.820 --> 42:55.739
- What have you been telling him?
- Nothing.

42:55.823 --> 42:59.826
It's just... I had this really strange dream

42:59.911 --> 43:01.995
and I must've told him all about it.

43:03.665 --> 43:05.874
Wait.

43:07.502 --> 43:08.794
- Charlie.
- Scott.

43:08.878 --> 43:10.587
- Hi, Dad.
- Nice jammies.

43:10.672 --> 43:13.257
Thanks. About what you said
in the house...

43:13.341 --> 43:15.092
- Who showed you the workshop?
- The elf.

43:15.176 --> 43:18.428
- How'd I get the pajamas?
- I told you. Judy.

43:18.513 --> 43:20.097
Oh, wait, wait.

43:20.181 --> 43:23.684
Judy was the name of the waitress
at the restaurant last night.

43:23.768 --> 43:27.437
- Some waitress gave you pajamas?
- What's this all about?

43:27.522 --> 43:30.732
Dad took me to the North Pole,
and Larry showed me the workshop.

43:30.817 --> 43:33.819
- The North Pole!
- Yeah. Dad's the new Santa.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.781
The regular Santa fell off the roof
and Dad put on the suit.

43:37.865 --> 43:40.951
Charlie, we'll discuss this at home.

43:47.709 --> 43:50.585
The clause. The Santa Clause.

43:52.297 --> 43:53.880
It's just a dream.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.424
Stuff like that doesn't happen.

43:55.508 --> 43:57.884
It was a dream. Come on!

43:59.470 --> 44:04.558
I don't even wear pajamas.
Normally I sleep naked. Buck naked! Ha!

44:04.642 --> 44:06.101
Morning, Mrs. McGloin.
Mary Catherine.

44:06.185 --> 44:07.936
Eyes front, Mary Catherine!

44:08.021 --> 44:10.230
Sometimes boxer shorts. You know.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.566
So, remember, kids,

44:12.650 --> 44:16.111
there is nothing more painful
than third degree burns.

44:19.324 --> 44:22.492
Well, thank you, Fireman O'Hara.

44:22.577 --> 44:25.787
And I think the whole class
will join me in saying

44:25.872 --> 44:28.081
sorry about your partner.

44:31.127 --> 44:35.005
Well, perhaps this is a good time
to bring up the psychiatrist.

44:35.089 --> 44:39.468
Charlie, would you like
to introduce your...

44:40.636 --> 44:41.970
Dr. Miller!

44:42.930 --> 44:45.849
Can I ask Dad to go first?

44:45.933 --> 44:48.518
Well, if that's how you feel, Charlie.

44:48.603 --> 44:53.065
That's how he feels, Neal. Come on.
Nice sweater, buddy.

44:55.818 --> 44:59.863
This is my dad, Scott Calvin.
He's got a really neat job.

44:59.947 --> 45:03.492
- Thank you, Charlie.
- My dad is Santa Claus.

45:04.994 --> 45:06.203
Oh, boy.

45:06.788 --> 45:10.415
I think what he means is,
I'm like Santa Claus.

45:10.958 --> 45:13.752
We're both giving, we're both jolly,

45:13.836 --> 45:17.506
and we both work very hard
one day a year.

45:17.590 --> 45:21.218
- Oh, boy!
- That's not what I mean, Dad.

45:21.302 --> 45:24.679
Look, on Christmas Eve,
my dad pushed Santa off the roof.

45:24.764 --> 45:26.390
- No, Charlie.
- Santa disappeared

45:26.474 --> 45:28.016
- and my dad took his place.
- Charlie!

45:28.101 --> 45:30.852
Then I went with him
to deliver all the presents.

45:30.937 --> 45:34.272
Then the reindeer flew us to
the North Pole where the head elf

45:34.357 --> 45:37.317
- Bernard gave me this.
- Charlie...

45:37.402 --> 45:41.822
Look, I work for a toy company.
I deliver toys all over the country.

45:41.906 --> 45:46.076
So, in a way, I'm like Santa Claus.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.995
- Yes, sweetheart?
- Do you make the toys?

45:49.080 --> 45:51.373
No, stupid, the elves do!

45:51.457 --> 45:53.500
Bobby, we don't say "stupid,"

45:53.584 --> 45:57.170
and we don't say "elves."
They're "little people."

45:57.255 --> 45:59.589
No, but they really are elves.

45:59.674 --> 46:03.218
- Whatever, honey.
- Which one's your favorite reindeer?

46:03.302 --> 46:07.597
- Comet.
- I don't have a favorite.

46:07.682 --> 46:10.559
So, let me get this straight, Santa.

46:10.643 --> 46:13.603
You mean, when I grow up,
if I wanna be Santa Claus,

46:13.688 --> 46:15.939
all I gotta do is push you off a roof?

46:16.023 --> 46:18.817
He said that it was
the best Christmas he ever had?

46:18.901 --> 46:19.901
Oh, big surprise!

46:19.986 --> 46:22.612
It's just nice to hear it from him.
Is that a problem with you?

46:22.697 --> 46:25.449
All right. So?

46:25.533 --> 46:28.743
May I speak, please? I am a doctor.

46:28.828 --> 46:31.204
No, he's not.
He's a psychiatrist.

46:31.289 --> 46:34.624
Please. Go ahead, Dr. Miller.

46:34.709 --> 46:36.960
I guess we know
who's the teacher's pet.

46:37.044 --> 46:39.463
Scott! Oh, grow up.

46:39.547 --> 46:42.966
The reason we're here is that
this is far more serious

46:43.050 --> 46:46.219
than a boy believing or not believing
in Santa Claus.

46:46.304 --> 46:49.806
That's right, because Charlie thinks
that this whole thing actually happened.

46:49.891 --> 46:54.102
Scott, what was the last thing
you and Charlie did

46:54.187 --> 46:56.313
before you went to bed Christmas Eve?

46:56.397 --> 47:00.192
We shared a bowl of sugar,
did some shots of brown liquor,

47:00.276 --> 47:03.111
played with my shotguns,
field dressed a cat,

47:03.988 --> 47:06.156
looked for women.

47:06.949 --> 47:08.575
I read him a book!

47:08.659 --> 47:11.161
- What book?
- Hollywood Wives.

47:11.746 --> 47:14.331
The Night Before Christmas, folks.
Come on!

47:14.415 --> 47:17.167
And did you go to the North Pole?

47:17.251 --> 47:18.877
This is ridiculous.
I don't have time for this.

47:18.961 --> 47:20.337
Ridiculous

47:20.421 --> 47:25.008
or not, Scott, for Charlie,
this isn't some dream, it is real.

47:25.092 --> 47:30.847
You need to sit down with Charlie.
Explain to him you are not Santa Claus.

47:31.557 --> 47:33.934
They're like the bears
at the North Pole, Dad.

47:34.018 --> 47:37.729
Charlie, I already told you,
we did not go to the North Pole.

47:37.813 --> 47:40.232
- That was a dream.
- You're in denial, Dad.

47:40.316 --> 47:42.234
Denial! You don't even know
what that means.

47:42.318 --> 47:45.612
Well, you are. I know what happened.

47:45.696 --> 47:49.449
How do you know that? How?
You don't have any proof.

47:49.992 --> 47:51.618
- Proof?
- Why can't we both

47:51.702 --> 47:54.329
think of it as just a great dream
and forget about it?

47:54.413 --> 47:58.208
What about this?
Remember all the neat stuff inside?

47:58.626 --> 48:02.379
Charlie, this is a toy.

48:02.463 --> 48:06.258
We used to make things like this
at work, but no one bought 'em.

48:06.551 --> 48:09.094
Here. I don't want
to talk about this anymore.

48:10.179 --> 48:11.888
I know who you are, Dad.

48:11.973 --> 48:14.391
You'll figure it out soon enough.

48:14.475 --> 48:19.229
There are a lot of kids that believe
in you. You can't let them down.

48:19.313 --> 48:21.690
Charlie, you're wrong.

48:28.614 --> 48:29.698
What's so funny?

48:30.157 --> 48:31.658
Nothing.

48:38.499 --> 48:41.084
He sees you when you're sleeping

48:41.168 --> 48:43.795
He knows when you're awake

48:43.879 --> 48:46.715
He knows if you've been bad or good

48:46.799 --> 48:48.925
Rollin'. Keep those reindeer rollin'

48:49.010 --> 48:52.887
Okay! You better watch out
You better not cry

48:52.972 --> 48:55.098
Come on, Dancer. Come on, Prancer.

48:55.182 --> 48:56.641
- Santa Claus is coming to town
- Whoa.

48:56.726 --> 48:57.767
We can't stop.

48:57.852 --> 49:00.937
But I have to go to the bathroom!

49:01.022 --> 49:04.357
I told you, should've gone
before we left the North Pole.

49:04.442 --> 49:06.192
...and rummy tum-tums

49:07.612 --> 49:08.737
Whoa.

49:08.821 --> 49:11.698
Right here. Turn over here.

49:11.782 --> 49:14.284
Curly-haired dolls that toddle and coo

49:14.368 --> 49:17.454
Elephant spokes and kiddie cars, too

49:24.045 --> 49:25.086
Where is he?

49:25.171 --> 49:28.715
Well, he could be in his room
jumping up and down on his bed,

49:28.799 --> 49:30.634
wearing a red hat and galoshes.

49:30.718 --> 49:33.428
I don't care what Neal's doing.
Where's Charlie?

49:33.554 --> 49:35.805
Oh, I see, I see.

49:35.890 --> 49:37.182
Well, if you can't be father of the year,

49:37.266 --> 49:38.642
why not be Father Christmas, huh?

49:39.435 --> 49:42.228
Charlie, it's just not logical.

49:42.313 --> 49:45.315
How can one man, in one night,

49:46.400 --> 49:48.443
visit all the children of the world?

49:48.527 --> 49:50.487
Not everyone celebrates Christmas.

49:50.571 --> 49:53.156
And I think there's some sort
of time continuum

49:53.240 --> 49:55.909
that breaks down once
Santa's in his sleigh.

49:55.993 --> 50:01.373
What about fireplaces?
A lot of people don't have them.

50:01.957 --> 50:04.292
How does Santa visit those people?

50:04.919 --> 50:07.003
He turns into Jell-O and...

50:07.088 --> 50:10.840
The fireplace kind of appears
and he goes through it like this.

50:10.925 --> 50:15.178
What about the reindeer?

50:15.262 --> 50:18.640
Have you ever seen a reindeer fly?

50:18.724 --> 50:20.600
- Yes.
- Well, I haven't.

50:21.769 --> 50:24.771
- Have you ever seen $1 million?
- No.

50:26.023 --> 50:30.276
Just because you haven't seen it
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

50:30.361 --> 50:32.696
Hi, Neal. Howdy, sport.

50:32.780 --> 50:34.197
- Hi, Dad.
- You wanna take a walk?

50:34.281 --> 50:36.449
- I wanna talk to you.
- Sure. I'll get my coat.

50:36.534 --> 50:38.535
Okay, hustle up.

50:38.619 --> 50:41.871
Scott? Can I have a minute?

50:41.956 --> 50:43.456
Sure.

50:44.834 --> 50:47.627
I think Charlie
is conflicted at the moment.

50:48.546 --> 50:50.547
Wow. Really?

50:50.631 --> 50:52.882
Boy. Hmm.

50:52.967 --> 50:55.218
Appreciate your analysis, I really do.

50:55.302 --> 50:59.222
Boy, you got more important things
to worry about, you know.

50:59.306 --> 51:00.515
Like, where are you gonna get
more sweaters

51:00.599 --> 51:02.267
after the circus pulls out of town?

51:03.894 --> 51:08.022
Scott! I mean, you're not listening.

51:08.107 --> 51:12.444
- We are very concerned about this.
- Concerned about what?

51:12.820 --> 51:14.237
This...

51:14.321 --> 51:17.365
If Charlie spending time with you
is the best thing for him.

51:26.751 --> 51:29.669
You were right about
the sweater, okay?

51:32.214 --> 51:33.256
Do you think by next year

51:33.340 --> 51:35.341
I'll be big enough to drive the sleigh
all by myself?

51:35.426 --> 51:36.760
No!

51:36.844 --> 51:40.054
- But I've been practicing.
- No, that's not what I'm talking about.

51:40.139 --> 51:44.309
Charlie, hold on a second. We've got
to talk about this Santa Claus thing.

51:48.522 --> 51:50.607
Charlie, there is no...

51:53.110 --> 51:54.360
No what, Dad?

51:58.157 --> 52:03.328
There's no reason why we have to
tell anybody about the North Pole.

52:03.412 --> 52:04.954
Why not?

52:05.039 --> 52:08.666
Well, sometimes some things,
big things,

52:09.210 --> 52:13.505
should remain unsaid,
like between two people...

52:13.589 --> 52:18.635
- Oh, you mean like a secret.
- Yes. Like a secret. Let's keep it secret.

52:18.719 --> 52:20.220
How come?

52:21.514 --> 52:24.641
Because of Mom and Neal.

52:24.725 --> 52:27.477
Not just because of them.
There's school.

52:27.561 --> 52:30.355
Everybody thinks...
No, it's not important what they think.

52:30.439 --> 52:32.106
It...

52:33.818 --> 52:35.860
How does five bucks sound to ya?

52:37.446 --> 52:41.282
This is something I really want you
to do for me, sport.

52:41.367 --> 52:46.079
I want to keep this secret.
Will ya do that, please?

52:46.205 --> 52:49.290
- Okay, Dad.
- All right.

52:49.750 --> 52:51.626
Great.

52:52.753 --> 52:56.464
You don't have to worry about
the Santa Claus thing anymore.

52:57.550 --> 52:59.843
So when do I get the five bucks?

52:59.927 --> 53:04.097
15 in the morning.
It's gonna be a beautiful day.

53:06.934 --> 53:10.603
Spend the day with me, Larry B.

53:13.190 --> 53:14.649
Oof!

53:24.034 --> 53:25.159
Huh?

53:33.085 --> 53:36.379
Something's wrong with the mirror.

53:39.091 --> 53:40.174
What?

53:40.926 --> 53:42.802
Something's wrong with the scale!

53:47.808 --> 53:50.435
Excuse me, excuse me.

53:50.519 --> 53:54.314
I'll have a field green salad and...
Oh, my God.

53:55.816 --> 53:57.984
- What the...
- What? Scott?

53:58.068 --> 54:00.820
Calvin?

54:04.909 --> 54:08.077
Sorry, the dry cleaner

54:08.162 --> 54:10.788
in my neighborhood went up in smoke,
some big chemical fire.

54:10.873 --> 54:13.249
All my clothes, poof, gone.

54:13.334 --> 54:16.753
God. Your... Your weight.

54:16.837 --> 54:18.963
What happened?

54:20.007 --> 54:23.927
Bee sting. Evidently, I'm allergic.

54:24.011 --> 54:28.097
Almost killed me. But the guy
at the emergency room says

54:28.182 --> 54:30.725
the swelling will go down.

54:30.809 --> 54:34.103
I hope. So, did I miss anything?

54:34.188 --> 54:36.606
No, we were just about to order lunch.

54:36.690 --> 54:38.816
Great! I'm starving.

54:38.901 --> 54:42.612
I'll have a salad and ice tea
and dressing on the side.

54:42.696 --> 54:46.950
Pasta and tomatoes and very
light on the oil. Can you do that?

54:47.034 --> 54:50.119
And I'll have a Caesar. No dressing.

54:50.204 --> 54:52.705
And one of those homemade cookies,
the warm chocolate chip. No nuts.

54:52.790 --> 54:56.167
And a little slice of cheesecake,
crème brûlée,

54:56.251 --> 54:59.045
and hot fudge sundae, extra hot fudge.

55:02.257 --> 55:04.175
On the side.

55:04.259 --> 55:08.179
- Anything to drink?
- Ice-cold milk.

55:08.722 --> 55:10.890
Stung by a bee, Scott?

55:11.809 --> 55:13.476
A big bee.

55:30.869 --> 55:32.036
Finished?

55:38.002 --> 55:41.379
Okay, now, remember.
This is just a storyboard.

55:42.506 --> 55:44.674
But here is our

55:44.758 --> 55:48.344
preliminary Total Tank TV spot.

55:48.429 --> 55:51.389
Okay, now, we've got Santa.
He's up in the North Pole.

55:51.473 --> 55:55.601
He's getting ready for Christmas!

55:55.686 --> 55:57.729
Oh, no.

55:58.147 --> 56:02.859
- Problem?
- It's just a little thing. The elves.

56:02.943 --> 56:06.362
- What about the elves?
- They look so funny.

56:06.447 --> 56:09.907
They're supposed to look funny.
They're elves.

56:09.992 --> 56:11.367
Just my opinion.

56:11.452 --> 56:15.621
Can't they look a little younger
with silver specks on their cheeks?

56:16.206 --> 56:18.624
Can we continue here?

56:18.709 --> 56:22.670
Okay, now this year,
Santa's not going out in a sleigh.

56:22.755 --> 56:27.008
This time he's going Total Tank!

56:27.092 --> 56:30.970
Wait a minute! No way! No way Santa's
going anywhere without his sleigh.

56:31.055 --> 56:33.556
He would if he's trying
to sell the Total Tank.

56:33.640 --> 56:35.975
Well, isn't that a pretty picture?

56:36.060 --> 56:38.561
Santa rolling down the block
in a panzer.

56:38.645 --> 56:41.939
Well, kids, I certainly hope
you've been good this year.

56:42.024 --> 56:44.650
'Cause it looks like Santa just
took out the Pearson home.

56:44.735 --> 56:46.360
- Incoming!
- Oh, please.

56:46.445 --> 56:48.654
And another thing.
What about the reindeer?

56:48.947 --> 56:51.157
Reindeer and Santa.
Santa and reindeer.

56:51.241 --> 56:52.825
It's kind of a package deal.

56:52.910 --> 56:55.745
- Calvin.
- You don't believe in Santa, do you?

56:55.829 --> 56:58.748
Calvin, can we get back
to the presentation?

56:58.832 --> 56:59.916
I'm not done yet.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.628
Since we've opened this box, have any
of you tried to build the Total Tank?

57:03.712 --> 57:06.297
It's got 10,000 parts,
and even if you do get it together,

57:06.381 --> 57:08.007
it breaks 10 minutes later.

57:08.092 --> 57:09.717
Then you got to spend more money
to buy more parts.

57:09.802 --> 57:12.929
- I thought that was the whole point.
- No, no, no, no.

57:13.013 --> 57:17.517
What we got to do is develop a basic,
simple, inexpensive toy

57:17.601 --> 57:19.977
that will nurture
a child's creative thinking.

57:20.062 --> 57:22.855
- Calvin...
- Here, try the brown ones.

57:23.482 --> 57:25.566
Can I see you outside a minute?

57:32.032 --> 57:34.367
I don't know what's happening to you.

57:34.451 --> 57:37.453
You're starting to look like
the Pillsbury Doughboy.

57:37.538 --> 57:41.165
- You're falling apart.
- I know! I know.

57:41.750 --> 57:43.167
I don't know what came over me.

57:43.252 --> 57:47.547
Just get some help.
You should see a doctor, a shrink.

57:47.631 --> 57:50.466
A dietitian, anything.
Just get some help.

58:13.740 --> 58:16.367
- Okay, Scott. The time is up.
- Whew!

58:16.451 --> 58:19.162
- Get over here and check your pulse.
- All right.

58:21.290 --> 58:23.541
Okay? Hmm.

58:24.835 --> 58:28.671
Ah.

58:29.798 --> 58:31.883
Well, nuts. I...

58:31.967 --> 58:34.427
Oh, no, your pulse is great.

58:34.511 --> 58:37.263
I don't know, Scott.
You're as healthy as a horse.

58:37.347 --> 58:40.016
Yeah. Clydesdale.

58:40.100 --> 58:43.436
Okay, look. So, what?
You put on a little weight.

58:43.520 --> 58:46.189
A little weight?
Does this look like a little weight to you?

58:46.273 --> 58:49.192
Weight can fluctuate from year to year.

58:49.276 --> 58:52.612
Fluctuate? You make it sound like
I'm retaining water.

58:52.696 --> 58:57.033
I've gained 45 pounds in a week!
Pete, what's happening to me?

58:57.117 --> 58:59.702
- What's your diet like?
- Milk and cookies.

58:59.786 --> 59:01.954
- Really?
- But I don't finish all the milk.

59:02.039 --> 59:07.501
Well, then, there is your problem.
Just try to cut back on the sweets.

59:07.586 --> 59:09.337
Anything else?

59:09.421 --> 59:13.090
Yeah. How fast does hair grow?
Facial hair?

59:13.175 --> 59:15.092
What?

59:15.177 --> 59:18.471
I shave in the morning
and in the afternoon, I look like this.

59:19.181 --> 59:23.434
Well, it could be a hormonal imbalance.

59:23.518 --> 59:25.978
- That would explain the mood swings.
- Mood swings?

59:26.605 --> 59:28.231
Look at my hair. It's turning gray.

59:28.315 --> 59:30.399
It's middle age, buddy. It happens.

59:30.484 --> 59:34.070
And with that body,
you should be thankful you have hair.

59:34.154 --> 59:37.490
Look, if it bothers you,
you can dye it, and you should diet!

59:38.992 --> 59:40.243
Just kidding.

59:40.327 --> 59:44.080
Okay, up with the shirt.
Let's take a listen to the old ticker.

59:44.164 --> 59:45.706
Whoa.

59:45.791 --> 59:48.000
- Okay.
- Ooh. That's cold.

59:48.585 --> 59:49.835
Ah.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.479
Get it!

01:00:37.718 --> 01:00:38.718
What?

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:44.724
I want some ballet slippers.

01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:06.412
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:01:06.496 --> 01:01:08.789
- Hold on now.
- Wait a minute. Wait, I'm not done.

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:12.418
Fax me. Hi, hey. This probably
looks pretty odd, doesn't it?

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:15.004
These kids lined up all by themselves.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:17.840
Scott, I think it's safe to say

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:21.761
you're taking this Santa thing
to an unhealthy level.

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:25.014
Here's my card. Call me.

01:01:25.098 --> 01:01:29.518
Scott, I really have to tell you
that this is beginning to scare me.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:33.189
I never in my wildest...
Well, no, okay, maybe my wildest...

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:36.359
But certainly never
in my normal dreams...

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:37.735
But then this is Scott
we're talking about.

01:01:37.819 --> 01:01:38.986
Laura, the point.

01:01:39.071 --> 01:01:42.365
I never thought you would stoop
to changing your physical appearance

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:45.117
in order to make Charlie like you.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:48.913
Do you have any concept of how
dangerous this is to a little boy?

01:01:48.997 --> 01:01:51.540
- Whoa, whoa. "How dangerous"?
- Mom, what's the matter?

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:54.877
- Come on, Charlie. We're going home.
- But we just started.

01:01:54.961 --> 01:01:56.879
You let him stay. I'll go.

01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:59.715
If you don't get your act together, Scott,
so help me...

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:00.883
Watch it, folks.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:02.635
- Mom!
- I will just...

01:02:12.896 --> 01:02:15.981
- Hi, there.
- Hi. I got a delivery for S.C.

01:02:16.066 --> 01:02:18.234
- You S. C?
- Scott Calvin, that's me.

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:20.236
Sign here, please.

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:23.823
All right.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:26.409
- Thanks. I'll get your packages.
- Packages?

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:28.744
- Yeah. There's quite a few of them.
- That's great.

01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:31.247
I'll leave the door open.
Just leave them inside here.

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:32.790
Will do.

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:07.533
It's the list!

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.296
"Armand Assante"?

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:21.714
Yo!

01:03:23.758 --> 01:03:27.136
Hold it! Hold... Oh! Hold it!

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.930
You! You! Take that... Come on!
Come on!

01:03:30.015 --> 01:03:31.056
Stay away from the truck.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:35.060
What am I supposed to do with all
these packages, guys? Come on!

01:03:40.192 --> 01:03:45.321
You know, I knew it. I knew that
something was going on. I just...

01:03:45.405 --> 01:03:49.492
What I can't believe is that he would
go behind our backs all this time,

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:52.244
confusing Charlie again just...

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:58.167
I... What are we supposed to do?

01:03:58.251 --> 01:04:00.920
Well, there's one obvious alternative.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:07.384
Okay.

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:15.559
- Annie, nice.
- Beep!

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:18.521
- Johnny, naughty.
- Johnny, wait up!

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:20.898
Gary, nice.

01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:22.942
Veronica, very nice.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.945
In your dreams, sleigh boy.

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:27.196
Hmm?

01:04:52.973 --> 01:04:55.015
I'm in big trouble. Mmm-hmm.

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:57.434
Thank you.

01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:02.147
Judge Wayland's office.

01:05:02.232 --> 01:05:05.484
Charlie, do you mind if
I talk to you for a minute?

01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:08.279
It's okay, honey. Come on.

01:05:10.991 --> 01:05:12.658
We won't be long.

01:05:17.706 --> 01:05:21.375
Are we doing the right thing, Neal?

01:05:21.459 --> 01:05:23.752
- Something needs to shake Scott.
- Yeah, but...

01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:26.922
But to take away his visitation rights.

01:05:27.007 --> 01:05:30.551
- Honey, the man is delusional.
- Okay, okay.

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:34.013
So maybe I'm having second thoughts,
kind of. I just...

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:37.433
I mean, what was so bad about
Charlie believing in Santa?

01:05:37.517 --> 01:05:39.685
Well, he's a little old.

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:42.021
Oh, come on, Laura.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:44.773
Don't you remember when you stopped
believing in Santa Claus?

01:05:46.026 --> 01:05:49.695
I was Charlie's age, I guess.

01:05:50.614 --> 01:05:54.033
I wrote Santa a letter
every week that year.

01:05:56.578 --> 01:06:01.415
Well, okay. You know, maybe...
Maybe not every week.

01:06:01.499 --> 01:06:02.875
But...

01:06:04.044 --> 01:06:08.464
Boy, I really wanted
a Mystery Date Game.

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:10.382
Do you remember those?

01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:14.470
No. Of course you don't.

01:06:14.554 --> 01:06:17.097
You know, no one does.

01:06:17.182 --> 01:06:20.225
I don't even think
they make them anymore, but...

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:24.813
Well, anyway...

01:06:24.898 --> 01:06:28.609
Christmas morning came and...

01:06:28.693 --> 01:06:31.153
Oh, I got dozens of presents.

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:33.697
I got everything.

01:06:36.326 --> 01:06:40.621
Except Mystery Date.

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:48.295
I was three, and it was
an Oscar Mayer wienie whistle.

01:06:50.548 --> 01:06:54.927
Christmas came. No wienie whistle.

01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.597
And that's when I stopped believing.

01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:00.849
You were three?

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:03.686
Yeah.

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:06.438
Oh, Neal.

01:07:09.651 --> 01:07:10.693
Where's Charlie?

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:13.112
- I want to talk to him.
- He's with the judge.

01:07:15.448 --> 01:07:16.740
Dad!

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:23.455
It's all okay. I told the judge everything

01:07:23.540 --> 01:07:25.791
about you and the North Pole.

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:30.921
After reviewing all of your testimonies,
I've come to a very difficult decision.

01:07:31.756 --> 01:07:35.634
I'm sorry to do this in light
of the holiday season.

01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:38.804
But in the best interest of the child,

01:07:39.806 --> 01:07:43.767
I'm granting the petition
of Dr. And Mrs. Miller.

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:50.524
Mr. Calvin, as of today, all of your
visitation rights are suspended,

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:54.027
pending a hearing
after the first of the year.

01:08:34.109 --> 01:08:36.111
- Hey, Neal.
- Scott?

01:08:36.196 --> 01:08:37.988
You're not supposed to be here.

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:40.240
Don't make me beat you up, Neal.

01:08:40.325 --> 01:08:42.618
Oh, would Santa really
beat someone up?

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:46.497
- I'm this close.
- So you still believe you're Santa?

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:47.622
I don't know.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:49.374
What do you mean
you don't know?

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:53.295
Of course you are, Dad.
How can you say that?

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:57.006
- Think of all those kids.
- The only kid I'm thinking about is you.

01:08:57.091 --> 01:09:00.803
Dad, I'm fine. You can't let them down.

01:09:00.886 --> 01:09:03.971
- They all believe in you.
- Charlie, listen.

01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:06.975
You listen!
You think you know who he is.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.560
- You don't!
- Charlie.

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:11.647
Honey, listen. You're confused.

01:09:11.731 --> 01:09:16.151
- I know exactly who he is.
- Charlie! He's not Santa.

01:09:16.236 --> 01:09:20.322
He is, too, Santa.
We went to the North Pole together.

01:09:20.406 --> 01:09:24.576
I saw it. The elves are real old
even though they look like me.

01:09:24.661 --> 01:09:29.540
Bernard called me sport,
'cause he knew everything. Right, Dad?

01:09:31.084 --> 01:09:32.584
Remember!

01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:59.653
Thank you, Charlie. Thank you.

01:10:01.739 --> 01:10:03.156
I love you, Dad.

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:08.871
Could you guys leave us
alone for a minute?

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:11.623
I mean, so I can say
goodbye to him properly?

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:14.334
Sure.

01:10:21.676 --> 01:10:24.887
So! You saw the ball come to life.

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:29.975
You bet I did.
Well, Charlie, I guess I better go.

01:10:30.059 --> 01:10:34.062
- I'll get my stuff.
- Wait, sport. Wait, wait.

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:38.233
I think it's a much better idea
if you stayed here with your mom.

01:10:38.318 --> 01:10:40.319
I want to be with you, Dad.

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:43.906
Boy, I love hearing you say that.

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:45.490
You mean I can go?

01:10:48.953 --> 01:10:50.162
Boy, this bird is dry.

01:10:50.246 --> 01:10:52.497
Haven't you people
heard about basting?

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.499
Bernard!

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:56.835
Hiya, sport.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.630
Bernard, can I go?
Please, can I go, Bernard?

01:10:59.714 --> 01:11:01.089
It's okay with me.

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:05.510
Charlie, if...

01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:11.516
Charlie?

01:11:17.398 --> 01:11:18.774
Scott!

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:22.778
Charlie!

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:29.117
This is our perpetrator!

01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:32.204
Scott Calvin, 38 years old.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.873
Believes himself to be Santa Claus.

01:11:35.333 --> 01:11:38.502
Ladies and gentlemen, this one
is not going to be easy to find.

01:11:38.586 --> 01:11:41.129
Won't the bright red suit
and beard give him away?

01:11:42.882 --> 01:11:46.468
Charlie's got some great ideas
on how to keep you safe.

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:49.096
Santa, this is Quintin,
head of research and development.

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.640
- Quintin, good to meet ya.
- Hello, Santa.

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.266
Charlie and I have
put our heads together.

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:55.686
I think we've got a few surprises for you.

01:11:55.770 --> 01:11:59.356
This is some of the best stuff that's
come out of the workshop since the ball.

01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:01.650
Fabulous. What happens
if I fall off the roof?

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:04.069
Is this the most
current photo you have?

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:07.197
Hold on.

01:12:12.412 --> 01:12:13.495
Hello?

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:17.082
- Mom!
- Oh, Charlie. Oh, my God.

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:20.002
Honey, how are you? Where are you?

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:24.006
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. We're up at the North Pole.

01:12:24.090 --> 01:12:27.718
- Charlie, are you sure you're okay?
- I'm terrific.

01:12:27.802 --> 01:12:30.053
I'm helping the elves
build a new sleigh.

01:12:30.138 --> 01:12:32.889
We're trying for a vertical takeoff.
Well, gotta go.

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:34.766
- The elves need me.
- No. Charlie, wait.

01:12:34.851 --> 01:12:37.310
- No. Don't hang up. Charlie, don't...
- See you at Christmas.

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:41.857
Fireplaces will
no longer be a problem.

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:51.908
It's a new fabric.
Completely flame retardant.

01:12:51.993 --> 01:12:53.744
It's light, yet durable.

01:12:53.828 --> 01:12:56.955
And you can wear the jumpsuit
under your coat and pants.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.584
But what do I do if I fall off a roof?

01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:05.714
We'll cordon off a three-block radius
around Dr. Miller's house.

01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:08.550
Calvin is to be apprehended unharmed.

01:13:08.634 --> 01:13:12.596
And remember, he'll probably
be dressed like Santa Claus.

01:13:32.492 --> 01:13:34.534
Give it your best shot

01:13:37.205 --> 01:13:40.582
What you got is oh, so sweet

01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:46.421
- Freeze!
- What?

01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:50.759
I need a routine, gimme all your loving

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:53.261
Not even my suit. It's a rental.

01:13:57.225 --> 01:14:02.354
Gimme all your loving
Don't let up until we're through

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:04.689
"From Comet, to Santa."
Did you make the card?

01:14:06.025 --> 01:14:08.485
It's a nice rope.
Just in case I fall off the roof?

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:13.448
Comet, this means a lot to me.
Thanks, buddy.

01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:15.659
If I blow my top

01:14:17.495 --> 01:14:20.455
Will you let it go to your head?

01:14:21.374 --> 01:14:23.500
Gimme all your loving

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:26.878
All right, let's go!

01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:31.049
- You ready to go, sport?
- You betcha, Dad.

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:34.052
Now Dasher, now Dancer!
Now Prancer and Vixen!

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:37.597
On Comet, on Cupid!
On Donner and Blitzen!

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:39.057
Hah!

01:14:41.018 --> 01:14:45.313
Bye! Bye, Quintin!
Bye, Peewee!

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:47.315
Merry Christmas!

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:48.984
Hyah!

01:14:49.569 --> 01:14:50.986
Whoa.

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:02.414
Take your time.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:07.586
Turn to your right. Hello!

01:15:11.132 --> 01:15:12.716
No.

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:15.760
Charlie, stay in your seat.

01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:18.847
I gotta show you this.
Radar-jamming jingle bells,

01:15:18.931 --> 01:15:21.183
snow screen,

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:23.852
DC-10 alert and air freshener.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:27.189
- Wow!
- And most important of all,

01:15:27.273 --> 01:15:29.065
- your hat.
- My hat?

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.234
It's lined with a two-way radio.

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:35.614
Microphone's in here.
It connects you directly to Judy.

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:38.700
- Wait a minute. What's this?
- Oh, that's a CD.

01:15:38.784 --> 01:15:43.079
- Compact disc.
- No. Cookie/cocoa dispenser.

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:45.498
The cocoa comes out nice and hot.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:48.460
And out pops a cookie.

01:15:49.629 --> 01:15:51.546
How could I have done this
without ya, Charlie?

01:15:51.631 --> 01:15:54.132
You couldn't.

01:16:18.824 --> 01:16:20.742
You're fatter this year.

01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:23.495
Thank you very much.
You've grown, too.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.039
And you were a very good girl this year,

01:16:26.123 --> 01:16:27.916
but I want you to
go back to sleep, okay?

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:45.684
- I think the milk's a little sour.
- It's soy milk.

01:16:45.977 --> 01:16:46.977
Huh?

01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:49.437
You said you were lactose intolerant.

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:53.108
I did say that, didn't I?
Thanks for remembering.

01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:55.527
Go to sleep.

01:16:59.407 --> 01:17:01.199
Merry Christmas, Sara.

01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:03.201
Merry Christmas, Santa.

01:17:05.579 --> 01:17:08.123
Look, there's Mom
and Neal's street.

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:09.791
- Can we go there next?
- Sure.

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:12.210
I made something for them
at the workshop.

01:17:35.318 --> 01:17:36.443
Freeze!

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:40.155
Oh!

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:42.324
You officers really gave me a start.

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:44.659
- Merry Christmas, guys.
- Not for you, fat boy.

01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:48.330
"Fat boy"? Guys.

01:17:48.414 --> 01:17:49.706
Uh-uh-uh. Nice and easy now.

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:54.002
Guys, guys. I got a lot of work to do.
This is a big mistake.

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:57.047
You got to watch the suit, too.
This is so old. It's an antique, you know.

01:17:57.131 --> 01:17:59.841
- Where's the boy?
- He's in the sleigh.

01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:01.801
We got Calvin. We're bringing him out.

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:05.263
Santa, are you okay? Over, over.

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:15.357
- Watch your head.
- Santa? Are you all right?

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:18.276
- Santa?
- It'll be okay, kids.

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:21.279
Let him go! Let Santa go!

01:18:37.296 --> 01:18:40.298
Honey, I'm sure Charlie's fine.

01:18:49.809 --> 01:18:53.853
We've got a problem. Santa was
at the Millers, but he's not responding.

01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:57.273
Well, time to deploy E.L.F.S.

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:05.073
Let's go!

01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:11.871
Go, go, go, go!

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:43.153
Look, I know you're Scott Calvin.

01:19:43.237 --> 01:19:47.532
You know you're Scott Calvin.
So let's make this simple.

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:51.035
I say, name. You say, Scott Calvin.

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:57.375
- Name?
- Kriss Kringle.

01:19:58.711 --> 01:20:01.588
- Name?
- Sinterklaas.

01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:04.132
- Name?
- Père Noël.

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:07.635
Babbo Natale. Pelz-Nicole.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:10.472
Topo Gigio.

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:14.934
Okay, Calvin. Maybe a couple of hours
in the tank'll change your mind.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.416
- Charlie?
- Yeah?

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:41.169
Don't worry. We're the good guys.

01:20:41.253 --> 01:20:43.755
Come on. Let's go save Santa.

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:51.554
We can't.
The police are watching this place.

01:20:51.639 --> 01:20:53.723
Yeah, they probably are.

01:20:53.807 --> 01:20:56.434
But you see, we weren't figuring
on walking out the front door.

01:20:56.519 --> 01:21:00.855
We find that we can get around
a lot faster if we fly.

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:02.941
Now grab hold of my hand.

01:21:04.109 --> 01:21:06.277
And hang on tight.

01:21:06.946 --> 01:21:09.197
- And Charlie?
- Yeah?

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:11.908
Don't ever try this
without elf supervision.

01:21:53.033 --> 01:21:54.659
We're looking for Santa Claus.

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:57.996
Go home, kids. Visiting hours are over.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:22:01.749
We're not kids, and we're not visiting.

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:06.337
- We're here to bust out my dad.
- You're the Calvin boy.

01:22:10.217 --> 01:22:11.467
Who are these other kids?

01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:13.052
We're your worst nightmare.

01:22:14.221 --> 01:22:16.931
Elves with attitude.

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:32.363
Shouldn't have had that donut.

01:22:35.242 --> 01:22:37.368
Untie me! I mean it!

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:38.703
Untie...

01:22:42.499 --> 01:22:44.751
- Charlie!
- Are you okay, Dad?

01:22:44.835 --> 01:22:46.586
I am now.

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:56.054
How'd you do that?

01:22:56.138 --> 01:22:58.556
Tinsel. Not just for decoration.

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:03.853
Hey, excuse me.
Can I get some of that tinsel?

01:23:09.485 --> 01:23:10.860
Mom?

01:23:12.196 --> 01:23:13.321
Mom!

01:23:14.657 --> 01:23:18.034
Neal? I'm home!

01:23:18.118 --> 01:23:19.577
Charlie?

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:24.707
- Charlie? Oh, my God, Charlie!
- Charlie.

01:23:24.792 --> 01:23:28.670
Sweetheart. Oh, God.
Come here, come here.

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:31.673
Oh, my boy. Oh, sweetheart.

01:23:31.757 --> 01:23:34.008
My boy, you're home!

01:23:34.093 --> 01:23:37.178
I missed you so much. How are you?

01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:41.015
- I'm fine, Mom.
- Are you okay? Look at me.

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:42.892
- Charlie, I missed you, honey.
- Mom, I'm fine. It's okay.

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:46.688
- I was so worried.
- Mom, put me down.

01:23:46.772 --> 01:23:50.441
- Stop kissing me.
- I don't have a lot of time.

01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:56.406
Did you leave the gifts
I made under the tree?

01:23:56.490 --> 01:23:58.700
- You bet I did.
- We better go.

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:00.702
- No, Charlie. No, no, no.
- No! Wait, Charlie.

01:24:00.786 --> 01:24:02.328
It's okay, Laura.

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:11.212
Actually, I...
I think it's a much better idea

01:24:11.296 --> 01:24:13.381
that you stay here
with your mom and Neal.

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:16.551
- Really?
- But, Dad...

01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:20.221
No buts, Charlie. I can't be selfish.

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:22.223
I can't be with ya all the time.

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:24.559
We're a family.

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:26.894
You, me, your mom...

01:24:28.647 --> 01:24:30.732
And Neal.

01:24:30.816 --> 01:24:33.943
And they need to be with ya, too.

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:36.487
I miss you too much.

01:24:38.574 --> 01:24:39.907
Come here a minute.

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:46.247
Listen to me.

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:49.792
Come on, listen.
There's a lot of kids out there.

01:24:49.877 --> 01:24:52.253
Okay? Millions of kids.

01:24:53.213 --> 01:24:56.924
They all believe in me.
They're counting on me, Charlie.

01:24:58.177 --> 01:25:02.430
I'm not gonna let 'em down.
I got a lot of work to do.

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:05.433
So I can't be selfish either.

01:25:07.227 --> 01:25:11.189
You gave me a wonderful gift.
Listen, a wonderful gift.

01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:14.275
You believed in me
when nobody else did.

01:25:14.359 --> 01:25:16.611
You helped make me Santa.

01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:20.990
Selfish? Come on.

01:25:21.074 --> 01:25:24.619
You're the least selfish person I know.

01:25:28.207 --> 01:25:31.000
I love you, Santa Claus.

01:25:32.586 --> 01:25:34.337
I love you, son.

01:25:39.927 --> 01:25:44.305
It's okay. Okay. It's okay.

01:25:52.815 --> 01:25:54.315
Laura, what do you think?

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:56.025
Christmas Eve
you guys spend with Charlie?

01:25:58.779 --> 01:26:01.280
Oh, my God.

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:04.867
It's you.

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:08.746
It really is you.

01:26:10.874 --> 01:26:12.542
You really are

01:26:14.086 --> 01:26:15.920
Santa Claus.

01:26:16.755 --> 01:26:19.966
- Pretty cool, huh?
- Oh, my God.

01:26:21.009 --> 01:26:23.177
And your parents thought
I'd never amount to anything.

01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:28.558
Wait. Don't go yet.
I have something for you.

01:26:29.601 --> 01:26:31.352
It's Santa.

01:26:34.898 --> 01:26:38.150
- Scott.
- Neal.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:49.871
Santa?

01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:51.247
It's okay, Neal.

01:26:54.793 --> 01:26:56.127
Here.

01:26:57.379 --> 01:26:59.839
It's... Well, it's...

01:26:59.923 --> 01:27:03.801
It's my Christmas present for you.
It's the custody papers.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:09.682
And I want you to come
and see Charlie as often as you can.

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:11.559
You can count on it.

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:13.936
Thanks, Laura.

01:27:18.734 --> 01:27:21.152
Merry Christmas.

01:27:21.278 --> 01:27:24.655
What's all this boo-hooing going
on here? Hey, how ya doing?

01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:27.074
It's nothing, Bernard.
I'm just saying goodbye to Charlie.

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:30.453
What goodbye?
You still got the glass ball, right?

01:27:30.537 --> 01:27:31.579
Yeah.

01:27:31.663 --> 01:27:36.000
Well, all you got to do is shake it
whenever you want to see your dad.

01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:37.293
Really?

01:27:37.377 --> 01:27:39.253
He can come back to see you

01:27:39.338 --> 01:27:41.255
anytime, day or night.

01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:43.341
Hey, have I ever steered ya wrong?

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:48.179
Nice sweater.

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:50.139
Hey, did we make this?

01:27:51.350 --> 01:27:56.437
Laura. He's sucking us
into his delusions.

01:27:56.521 --> 01:28:00.358
Look at the elaborate
measures he's taken.

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:04.111
Neal, relax.

01:28:04.196 --> 01:28:06.280
I'll explain it to you later.

01:28:08.742 --> 01:28:10.242
Where'd he go?

01:28:23.048 --> 01:28:24.966
Go, go, go, go!

01:28:25.467 --> 01:28:27.218
Team one!

01:28:34.726 --> 01:28:36.227
Okay, stand back, folks.
Give us some room.

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:38.521
- Here you go, sir.
- Thanks.

01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:42.191
Return to your homes!
Stay off the street!

01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:44.485
Come on, folks. Let us do our job here.

01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:47.947
Excuse me, excuse me. Hi!

01:28:48.031 --> 01:28:49.657
You know, you don't
have to send anybody...

01:28:49.741 --> 01:28:50.908
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh, my gosh!

01:28:50.993 --> 01:28:53.828
That's my ex-husband
and he's already up the chimney.

01:28:53.912 --> 01:28:55.705
Chief, look up there.

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:01.669
Santa Claus!

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:03.713
Santa.

01:29:05.799 --> 01:29:07.425
Look!

01:29:13.849 --> 01:29:15.558
What is it?

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:20.104
Oh, wow!

01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:22.189
Up there. Do you see it?

01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:23.816
Hey, do you see it?

01:29:27.863 --> 01:29:30.448
- Goodbye, Charlie.
- Bye, Dad!

01:29:30.532 --> 01:29:34.285
Merry Christmas to all!
And to all a good night!

01:29:39.124 --> 01:29:40.708
I'm sorry, Charlie.

01:29:40.792 --> 01:29:44.712
That's okay, Neal.
You were just denying your inner child.

01:29:46.423 --> 01:29:50.551
You're gonna make a great psychiatrist
one day, kid.

01:29:50.635 --> 01:29:55.222
No, I think I'm going to go
into the family business.

01:30:01.354 --> 01:30:02.855
Look out below!

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.495
My wienie whistle.

01:30:47.609 --> 01:30:50.277
- Bye!
- Merry Christmas!

01:31:08.672 --> 01:31:11.257
Charlie? Time to come inside.

01:31:13.552 --> 01:31:16.053
Mom,
this stupid ball's not working.

01:31:22.769 --> 01:31:25.104
Shoot.

01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:34.155
- Hey, sport!
- Dad!

01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:37.324
You miss me already?
I've been gone, what? Ten minutes?

01:31:37.409 --> 01:31:40.661
Give me a break.
I was on my way to Cleveland.

01:31:41.830 --> 01:31:43.038
Come here and give me a hug.

01:31:52.090 --> 01:31:54.925
- Do you want to go for a quick ride?
- Yeah!

01:31:56.469 --> 01:31:59.930
- Of course, it's up to your mom.
- Please, Mom.

01:32:02.767 --> 01:32:04.393
Go on. Get out of here.

01:32:06.479 --> 01:32:09.023
All right. Hold on.

01:32:13.361 --> 01:32:16.614
- On our way.
- Bye, Mom!

01:32:21.244 --> 01:32:22.786
Just a quick one.

01:32:23.872 --> 01:32:25.206
And...

01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:28.209
Not over any oceans, Scott.

01:32:28.293 --> 01:32:31.462
- Bye, Mom! Bye!
- Scott.

01:32:32.214 --> 01:32:34.423
Scott!

01:32:34.674 --> 01:32:36.592
Santa!

01:33:16.341 --> 01:33:19.760
All the brightly colored paper

01:33:19.844 --> 01:33:23.055
Lies around the Christmas tree

01:33:23.139 --> 01:33:25.474
While mothers shake their heads

01:33:25.558 --> 01:33:30.312
And pack the decorations carefully

01:33:37.153 --> 01:33:40.656
All the little children know that

01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:43.951
Monday's just another day

01:33:44.035 --> 01:33:47.413
They feel a little sad to think

01:33:47.497 --> 01:33:50.791
That Santa's gone away

01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:54.253
But Christmas will return

01:33:54.337 --> 01:33:57.798
And joyful hearts like candles burn

01:33:57.882 --> 01:34:01.302

01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:04.638
In countries far and near

01:34:04.848 --> 01:34:07.975
And if we live and learn

01:34:08.226 --> 01:34:11.812
To show the world our real concern

01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:14.565
Then Christmas will return, yeah

01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:53.812
In the bitter cold of winter

01:34:53.897 --> 01:34:56.815
The spark is still alive
