WEBVTT

00:51.218 --> 00:52.052
All set.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.055
Thanks.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.108
What do you got there?

01:06.191 --> 01:08.068
Sorry. What do you got there?

01:09.194 --> 01:13.824
Themes of religious conversion
in Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.784
Oh, my God. Spoiler alert, please.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.077
What about you?

01:17.578 --> 01:20.330
-Are you reading…
-Me? Well… It's…

01:20.414 --> 01:22.291
Oh, yeah, this is a real treat.

01:22.374 --> 01:25.002
"All Quiet on the Western Blunt:

01:25.711 --> 01:28.672
Drug Use by Enlisted Soldiers
during World War I."

01:28.755 --> 01:31.258
-No, stop.
-No, that's what it is.

01:31.341 --> 01:33.468
Kid's a genius.
You should flunk every other child.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.053
I couldn't agree more.

01:39.558 --> 01:40.893
I'm sorry. Who are you?

01:43.061 --> 01:44.062
Gemma.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.610
All right.

01:50.736 --> 01:51.737
Mark.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.490
-Nice to meet you, Mark.
-You too.

02:48.752 --> 02:52.297
Gemma, where did you go?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.214
He'll be okay.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.633
There might be some deficits.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.011
Hopefully, nothing long term.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.095
Are you a doctor?

03:41.180 --> 03:42.347
Do we need an ambulance?

03:44.016 --> 03:46.059
Can you answer
one of my questions, please?

03:46.894 --> 03:48.812
-Do we need an ambulance?
-No.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.190
He's gonna sleep for a while.

03:51.273 --> 03:52.733
Okay. How long?

03:52.816 --> 03:54.109
Hard to say.

03:54.193 --> 03:57.237
We'll need some equipment
from downstairs. Are you clumsy?

03:57.321 --> 03:59.948
What? Why do you have equipment
in Mark's basement?

04:00.449 --> 04:02.409
Your brother's reintegrating.

04:03.285 --> 04:04.536
No, he's not.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.788
-I know that was troubling.
-Okay.

04:06.872 --> 04:08.207
I can tell that you're smarter than me,

04:08.290 --> 04:10.292
so forgive me if I say this,
like, super plainly,

04:10.375 --> 04:13.504
but if you give one solitary thought
to messing with my brother again,

04:13.587 --> 04:15.756
I will throw you off a fucking bridge.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.050
-Devon--
-We don't do that again.

04:18.132 --> 04:19.801
-We'll discuss it later.
-Nope!

04:19.885 --> 04:22.804
No. It's settled fucking law, lady, okay?

04:22.888 --> 04:24.097
Just accept it.

04:25.098 --> 04:25.933
The end.

04:27.851 --> 04:29.228
It's what he wants.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.021
What he wants is to know
whether Gemma's alive or not.

04:31.104 --> 04:31.980
She is.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.443
Please don't mess with me.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.987
She is alive.

06:42.694 --> 06:44.363
You've eaten today, honey?

06:45.197 --> 06:46.365
Yes.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.077
Done your reading?

06:51.620 --> 06:52.829
Fifty pages.

06:55.958 --> 06:57.626
Calisthenics?

06:58.293 --> 06:59.503
Yes.

07:04.174 --> 07:06.468
If you were caught in a mudslide,

07:06.552 --> 07:10.264
would you be more afraid
of suffocating or drowning?

07:14.351 --> 07:15.352
Drowning.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.045
How many rooms today?

07:43.797 --> 07:44.798
Six.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.403
Shit.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.473
Ready?

10:06.690 --> 10:07.691
There she is.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.821
Could I please get a break?

10:13.614 --> 10:14.656
Just for a little while.

10:15.908 --> 10:17.451
But it's been six weeks.

10:19.870 --> 10:21.205
I was just here.

10:22.289 --> 10:23.332
I know.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.626
Nobody likes the dentist.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.129
I should have been an accountant
like my mom wanted.

10:33.217 --> 10:34.510
Please, have a seat.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.662
Excellent.

11:06.416 --> 11:10.003
Now, let's see how we're doing.

11:12.256 --> 11:13.674
Open wide, please.

11:28.564 --> 11:30.065
How long was I in there?

11:30.566 --> 11:31.608
Two hours.

12:00.929 --> 12:01.930
Okay.

12:10.022 --> 12:11.440
Oh, bud.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.109
I need you back, m'lady.

12:16.028 --> 12:17.112
Please come back.

13:01.865 --> 13:05.994
-Hey. Oh, bless you.
-Hey.

13:06.078 --> 13:07.287
Excuse me.

13:07.371 --> 13:08.872
-Hi.
-Hey.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.416
That was fun last night.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.584
It was.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.754
I'm sorry. I have a lecture at 3:00
on Hadji Murad

13:15.838 --> 13:18.257
-and my notes are all over the place.
-No. That's… It's okay.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.635
I just… I brought you something.

13:25.514 --> 13:26.640
It's an ant farm.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.520
Last night you said you liked ants. So…

13:33.146 --> 13:36.316
I said I liked… I like plants.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.776
Plants.

13:38.819 --> 13:42.364
-I hate ants.
-Oh, shit.

13:42.447 --> 13:45.701
-But I… I love farms.
-Good.

13:46.952 --> 13:49.162
I'm so fucking behind.

13:49.788 --> 13:51.540
I'm not even here.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.376
You're not here? Okay.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.295
What are you doing?

13:56.378 --> 13:58.547
What are you doing? What are you doing?

14:06.138 --> 14:07.055
Yeah.

14:08.974 --> 14:12.769
-Really?
-Well, I mean, you know, it was on sale.

14:13.312 --> 14:17.733
And who's putting it together,
Mr. Handyman? You?

14:17.816 --> 14:19.985
I happen to be quite handy.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.361
No, you're not.

14:21.445 --> 14:23.780
-What? How dare you.
-Handsy.

14:23.864 --> 14:24.948
Handsy?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.911
All right. Maybe I am kinda handsy.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.621
-Yeah?
-I like it.

15:28.011 --> 15:29.263
Yeah. Well…

15:29.346 --> 15:31.098
This is what I was hoping would come up.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.015
What happened?

15:32.099 --> 15:34.059
It really, truly wasn't that bad.

15:34.142 --> 15:36.395
For you. That's 'cause you can
scale walls like a gecko.

15:36.478 --> 15:40.023
This… It was like half a mile
of just exposed rock face.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.483
-Boulders. Fine.
-It sounds fun.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.277
There were a few boulders.

15:43.360 --> 15:46.280
Boulders? Babe, come on.
It was like the death zone of Everest.

15:46.363 --> 15:47.906
Like Chomolungma.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.825
-Any frozen bodies?
-No, I looked.

15:49.908 --> 15:51.702
But I do have photo evidence.
Look at them.

15:52.578 --> 15:54.663
-Oh, my God. What's wrong with you?
-Look.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.498
-Yeah, Ricken, what is wrong with you?
-Yeah.

15:56.582 --> 15:59.001
Hey, I belayed my first couloir
in middle school.

15:59.084 --> 15:59.918
-So, I…
-What?

16:00.002 --> 16:01.253
What?

16:01.336 --> 16:03.172
-That sounds painful.
-We all know what that means.

16:03.255 --> 16:04.131
I'm sorry he said that.

16:04.214 --> 16:06.258
Outdoorsmanship courses through my veins.

16:06.341 --> 16:07.759
-I think it's hot.
-I make no apology for it.

16:07.843 --> 16:09.469
Wait, how did you get down?

16:09.553 --> 16:11.889
-I scooted on my ass.
-Are there photos of that?

16:11.972 --> 16:12.890
No. It was a no-photo zone.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.433
A no-photo death zone.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.059
Exactly. Thank you.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.520
You and I will ramble together someday.
The two of us.

16:18.604 --> 16:19.813
It will be a grand adventure.

16:19.897 --> 16:21.899
I feel like we spend
a lot of time together.

16:21.982 --> 16:23.692
-Not enough. No, Mark.
-Really?

16:23.775 --> 16:25.402
-Are you not drinking?
-What are we gonna do there?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.446
Did you know you can purify urine into…

16:27.529 --> 16:28.739
-Oh, fuck right off.
-…drinkable water?

16:28.822 --> 16:29.948
Why would I do that?

16:30.032 --> 16:32.743
To experience the beauty
and wonder of nature.

16:32.826 --> 16:34.369
But why is it you want to do this so bad?

16:34.453 --> 16:36.246
-Okay.
-I want to know you better.

16:36.330 --> 16:39.499
Why is it you need
to have me come with you…

18:00.414 --> 18:02.583
Hey, hon. Do you know
where I put the keys?

18:06.044 --> 18:09.006
-Are you okay? Oh, baby.
-No.

18:30.903 --> 18:31.904
Ms. Casey.

18:32.613 --> 18:34.531
I'm here to observe Helly R.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.159
No one told me.

18:37.993 --> 18:42.289
Ms. Cobel's orders.
I am to watch her for signs of sadness,

18:42.372 --> 18:45.584
and verbally encourage her
to forgo further suicide attempts.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.576
Are the severance barriers holding?

20:01.910 --> 20:04.496
Yes, the technology is working.

20:08.750 --> 20:09.960
You like her.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.046
She's easy to like.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.550
She is fond of me too, of course.

20:18.427 --> 20:20.554
Didn't she try and break your fingers?

20:45.162 --> 20:45.996
Hi.

20:46.079 --> 20:48.165
Hi. I'll be right with you.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.249
Thanks.

21:26.787 --> 21:27.788
You know…

21:29.790 --> 21:32.376
it's the next step for a lot of people.

21:36.755 --> 21:37.756
I love you.

21:39.174 --> 21:40.217
I love you too.

21:42.553 --> 21:43.679
I'm sorry.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.390
You ready?

22:29.224 --> 22:30.225
It's time.

22:37.107 --> 22:38.609
Locked and loaded.

22:38.692 --> 22:40.110
Third time's the charm.

22:40.194 --> 22:41.486
That's what they say.

22:41.570 --> 22:43.030
I'll write you a thank-you note.

22:43.906 --> 22:45.657
You hate writing thank-you notes.

22:47.117 --> 22:48.785
Oh, my God. I'm a little nervous.

22:50.787 --> 22:51.872
Baby?

22:51.955 --> 22:52.998
I said I'm a little nervous.

22:53.081 --> 22:55.459
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

22:55.542 --> 22:58.795
it's the final step and, you know,

22:58.879 --> 23:02.841
there's a kid that's out there
just waiting for us.

23:03.509 --> 23:05.719
Just got to reach out and grab her. Right?

23:07.554 --> 23:08.555
What if it doesn't work?

23:08.639 --> 23:10.224
Turn around and bend over.

23:14.811 --> 23:16.647
Sorry. You okay?

23:42.589 --> 23:44.258
How are you feeling?

23:46.468 --> 23:47.719
My mouth hurts.

23:48.804 --> 23:50.931
Which room caused your mouth to hurt?

23:51.890 --> 23:53.225
The first one.

23:54.560 --> 23:55.561
Wellington.

24:03.777 --> 24:05.946
How many rooms did you visit today?

24:08.615 --> 24:09.616
Six.

24:10.158 --> 24:12.828
The Billings room, the Lucknow room,

24:12.911 --> 24:18.125
St. Pierre, Cairns, Zurich, and…

24:18.208 --> 24:19.793
The Wellington room.

24:19.877 --> 24:21.712
The Wellington. Excellent.

24:23.172 --> 24:27.092
And what happened in the rooms?
You remember nothing?

24:29.261 --> 24:30.262
Nothing.

24:38.562 --> 24:40.189
How did you feel in the hall?

24:41.231 --> 24:45.444
Did you exit any of the rooms
feeling despair?

24:46.612 --> 24:49.198
Fervor? Gaiety?

24:51.783 --> 24:53.744
There's only one room
I haven't been to yet,

24:53.827 --> 24:55.329
and today it had a name on it.

24:59.208 --> 25:00.334
Cold Harbor.

25:02.127 --> 25:06.882
So, what happens,
once I've been in all the rooms?

25:12.387 --> 25:16.725
You will see the world again,
and the world will see you.

25:20.604 --> 25:23.941
So, I'll see Mark?

25:25.776 --> 25:28.529
Mark will benefit
from the world you're siring.

25:29.530 --> 25:33.200
Kier will take away all his pain,
just as Kier has taken away yours.

25:38.914 --> 25:43.001
Can you please just talk
like a normal person?

25:48.006 --> 25:51.718
Good night, Gemma. Dream sweet.

26:14.449 --> 26:16.034
Gemma, coffee's ready!

26:35.137 --> 26:36.138
Is he okay?

26:36.221 --> 26:37.306
He's stable.

26:37.389 --> 26:38.932
It was an isolated event.

26:39.516 --> 26:40.976
He's journeying now.

26:42.394 --> 26:43.854
When will he wake up?

26:43.937 --> 26:45.147
When he's ready to.

26:45.856 --> 26:46.982
Great.

26:49.818 --> 26:51.153
You really think this is gonna work?

26:52.321 --> 26:53.572
There's no other choice.

27:00.078 --> 27:01.830
There's an innie cabin.

27:02.539 --> 27:03.582
Come again?

27:04.166 --> 27:05.375
There… I mean, it's technically…

27:05.459 --> 27:08.253
It's a cottage where severed people
become their innies,

27:08.337 --> 27:09.546
and there was this woman--

27:09.630 --> 27:10.881
Damona Birthing Retreat.

27:12.049 --> 27:15.469
Well, so maybe if we go to the cabin,
we could talk to his innie, and he could--

27:15.552 --> 27:17.721
They're two completely different things.

27:18.263 --> 27:20.349
This is how you get Gemma out.

27:20.432 --> 27:22.893
Really, this? Because this looks like
how you kill my brother.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.647
You two are definitely related.

27:35.405 --> 27:36.990
-I could call her.
-Who?

27:37.074 --> 27:39.493
-Harmony Cobel.
-What? Why would you do that?

27:39.576 --> 27:41.036
She runs the severed floor.

27:41.119 --> 27:43.997
Not anymore, she doesn't.
She might know how to get in the cabin.

27:44.081 --> 27:46.208
And, fuck, she might know
how to get to Gemma.

27:46.291 --> 27:48.043
She's Lumon through and through.

27:48.126 --> 27:50.671
She was raised by them. She's a soldier.

27:50.754 --> 27:52.631
-It's a risk. I get that.
-A risk?

27:52.714 --> 27:55.008
-Yeah.
-She will turn you over to them.

27:55.092 --> 27:56.301
Both of us.

27:56.385 --> 27:58.512
Everything I've done to fight, gone.

27:58.595 --> 28:01.223
We resume the treatment
as soon as he wakes up.

28:01.306 --> 28:04.518
Okay. I have custody
of his brain now. You don't.

28:04.601 --> 28:05.769
I'm calling her.

28:18.156 --> 28:20.742
-Well, then, I can't be a part of this.
-What?

28:21.326 --> 28:23.495
If you do that… If you make that choice…

28:24.204 --> 28:25.622
What are you…
No, seriously, what are you doing?

28:25.706 --> 28:28.292
-Good luck.
-You can't leave him like this.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.669
No, no, no, I can't do this without you.

28:32.129 --> 28:33.922
You… Are you kidding?

28:34.715 --> 28:36.091
You're leaving now?

28:36.675 --> 28:39.970
This… This isn't my choice. It's yours.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.847
No, I need you to stay. I can't…

28:41.930 --> 28:44.683
I don't know what to do with this.
What do I do if he wakes up?

28:44.766 --> 28:46.351
Do not call that woman.

28:46.894 --> 28:47.895
Oh, my God.

28:59.907 --> 29:00.908
Hey.

29:01.950 --> 29:03.035
Chi…

29:03.869 --> 29:07.289
-Mark?
-Chikha… Chikha…

29:07.372 --> 29:09.583
-What are you trying to say?
-Chikhai…

29:11.543 --> 29:12.961
Chik…

29:13.045 --> 29:14.379
Chikhai bardo?

29:14.963 --> 29:17.174
I don't know.
It looks like two guys fighting.

29:18.175 --> 29:23.639
No, it's the same guy fighting himself,
defeating his own psyche. Ego death.

29:24.348 --> 29:26.225
How do you know it's the same guy?

29:26.308 --> 29:28.185
Well, the hair's the same.

29:30.187 --> 29:31.522
That thing came in the mail?

29:32.773 --> 29:35.484
Yeah. It's one of those things
where you have to draw a duck

29:35.567 --> 29:37.110
or a rabbit or whatever.

29:37.819 --> 29:40.697
I think I got onto the mailing list
at the clinic.

29:42.115 --> 29:43.742
Why are you wasting your time with this?

29:47.162 --> 29:49.122
Why are you being an asshole?

29:49.206 --> 29:51.542
I'm not. I'm just… I don't know.
It seems kind of…

29:53.669 --> 29:55.921
-weird.
-I'm enjoying this.

29:56.505 --> 29:59.424
Or was, until you ruined it.

29:59.508 --> 30:01.593
I think you might be
overreacting a little bit, Gemma.

30:02.344 --> 30:03.470
Don't do that.

30:04.096 --> 30:05.097
Do what?

30:06.390 --> 30:09.768
-Tell me how I'm feeling.
-I have no idea how you're feeling.

30:09.852 --> 30:12.229
Like shit. Beat to shit.

30:12.312 --> 30:14.231
So let's stop.

31:28.889 --> 31:31.850
It's okay. This is perfectly normal.

31:31.934 --> 31:35.229
Let's get you set up with that meal.
Bon appétit.

31:35.854 --> 31:38.524
Can I get you anything else? Coffee? Tea?

31:38.607 --> 31:40.025
Another pillow…

31:47.115 --> 31:49.201
He's stuck at 96%.

31:50.827 --> 31:52.871
The nose bleeds set us back.

31:54.831 --> 31:57.709
When he's done,
you're gonna have to say goodbye to her.

32:00.379 --> 32:01.588
I'm aware.

32:05.634 --> 32:06.677
For Kier.

32:12.349 --> 32:13.433
For Kier.

32:19.439 --> 32:21.900
Why are you wearing that stupid sweater?

32:53.432 --> 32:56.393
Dear Mr. Tisdale,

32:57.644 --> 33:00.606
I cannot thank you enough…

33:01.940 --> 33:05.694
for the thoughtful Christmas gift

33:06.403 --> 33:09.907
you sent my husband and I this year.

33:17.247 --> 33:20.834
We have never owned

33:21.418 --> 33:24.796
an electric grouter.

33:27.174 --> 33:30.302
And we look forward

33:30.385 --> 33:36.642
to the many happy

33:37.601 --> 33:39.520
memories

33:41.021 --> 33:43.398
it will

33:44.316 --> 33:45.317
provide.

33:49.821 --> 33:53.492
Come on now, sweetheart.
It's the last one.

34:03.001 --> 34:04.461
Nothing…

34:05.254 --> 34:06.463
says…

34:07.422 --> 34:10.759
Christmas like…

34:13.428 --> 34:14.554
grouting.

34:16.681 --> 34:19.351
It's actually a de-grouter,

34:20.936 --> 34:22.478
but close enough.

34:26.315 --> 34:28.569
How much longer do I have to do this?

34:29.319 --> 34:31.655
I told you, you're done.

34:31.737 --> 34:37.077
But Christmas has a funny way
of coming back around each year.

34:44.293 --> 34:46.170
It's always Christmas.

34:50.674 --> 34:51.884
Let's go.

35:03.896 --> 35:04.897
I love you.

35:10.194 --> 35:12.613
I said, "I love you."

35:18.702 --> 35:20.120
I love you too.

37:34.546 --> 37:35.547
Hello, Gemma.

37:36.507 --> 37:37.633
Dr. Mauer.

37:38.675 --> 37:39.843
How are you feeling?

37:42.221 --> 37:43.388
My hand hurts.

37:45.516 --> 37:48.060
And what room caused your hand to hurt?

37:52.814 --> 37:54.149
Allentown.

38:04.785 --> 38:05.994
I want to go home.

38:17.714 --> 38:19.550
Your husband remarried last year…

38:23.387 --> 38:25.264
and he has a daughter now.

38:30.227 --> 38:31.562
I don't believe you.

38:32.646 --> 38:34.815
You've been gone a long time, Gemma.

38:35.858 --> 38:37.192
He's moved on.

38:38.902 --> 38:40.487
Maybe you've moved on too.

38:42.281 --> 38:44.157
In one of the rooms. What do you think?

38:50.455 --> 38:54.084
Do you feel yourself gravitating
towards one room or another?

38:55.294 --> 38:58.797
Maybe you felt things behind those doors
you never felt with Mark.

39:01.049 --> 39:02.467
Maybe I've seen it.

39:08.223 --> 39:10.559
The Death of Ivan Ilyich.

39:10.642 --> 39:13.228
Let me guess. He dies at the end.

40:53.871 --> 40:54.913
Gemma!

41:01.879 --> 41:03.630
Gemma! Stop!

41:04.506 --> 41:05.507
Gemma!

41:22.566 --> 41:23.567
Hey.

41:23.650 --> 41:25.277
You sure you don't want to come?

41:26.361 --> 41:29.031
-It's charades.
-That's gonna be, like, 20 minutes of it.

41:29.114 --> 41:30.699
Yeah. But, you know.

41:32.451 --> 41:33.952
Or I could stay?

41:34.036 --> 41:36.246
No, you should probably go.

41:36.330 --> 41:38.665
I mean, this thing's
gotta be in tonight anyway, so…

41:40.042 --> 41:44.046
Okay. Did you get the Denali thing I sent?

41:44.129 --> 41:45.714
The… No.

41:45.797 --> 41:49.176
I'll look at it. I'll check it out.

41:49.259 --> 41:52.346
All right. Well, I'll be back
at, like, 10:00.

41:52.971 --> 41:54.223
Okay.

41:54.306 --> 41:55.349
I love you.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.813
-I said--
-Oh, no, I love you too, hon. I'm sorry.

42:04.608 --> 42:05.734
-Bye.
-See you.

42:46.316 --> 42:47.442
Ms. Casey.

42:50.654 --> 42:51.905
Mr. Milchick.

42:52.531 --> 42:53.699
I'm so sorry.

42:56.118 --> 42:57.452
What's happening?

42:57.536 --> 42:58.537
Nothing.

42:58.620 --> 43:01.874
Your outie came in
for a public art exhibition

43:01.957 --> 43:04.585
and found herself in the wrong elevator.

43:10.841 --> 43:12.009
How long have I been--

43:12.092 --> 43:15.053
If you wouldn't mind turning around
and heading back in,

43:15.137 --> 43:16.680
it would be greatly appreciated.

43:18.390 --> 43:19.683
-But--
-On you go.

43:36.617 --> 43:38.660
-Where's--
-Thank you, Ms. Casey.

45:08.041 --> 45:09.042
No.

46:28.121 --> 46:29.122
Mark.

46:33.585 --> 46:35.963
-Come on.
-Mark.

47:27.514 --> 47:28.515
Mark?

47:30.434 --> 47:32.769
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey.

47:34.938 --> 47:35.939
Hi.

47:41.111 --> 47:42.362
Hey.

47:50.829 --> 47:52.039
Careful. Easy.

47:59.087 --> 48:00.464
Oh, Mark.

48:02.716 --> 48:03.926
Where'd you go?
