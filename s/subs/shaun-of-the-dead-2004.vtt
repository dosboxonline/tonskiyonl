WEBVTT

00:54.054 --> 00:55.965
Bartender: Last orders, please.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.970
Liz: Shaun. Yeah?

01:05.482 --> 01:07.188
Do you see what I'm saying?

01:07.276 --> 01:08.732
Yeah, totally.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.690
I know he's your best friend,
but you do live with him.

01:12.781 --> 01:14.146
I know.

01:14.241 --> 01:16.027
It's not that I don't like ed.

01:16.118 --> 01:18.404
Ed, it's not
that I don't like you.

01:18.495 --> 01:20.076
It's all right.

01:20.831 --> 01:23.493
It'd just be nice if we could...
Fuck.

01:24.209 --> 01:27.201
Spend a bit more time together.
Bollocks.

01:27.296 --> 01:30.333
Just the two of us. Cock it.

01:30.424 --> 01:33.224
It's just with ed here, it's no wonder
I always bring my flatmates out,

01:33.302 --> 01:35.293
and then that only
exacerbates things.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.968
What do you mean?

01:37.055 --> 01:39.637
Well, you guys
hardly get on, do you?

01:39.725 --> 01:41.511
No, what does "exacerbate" mean?

01:41.602 --> 01:44.093
It means to make things worse.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.677
Right, right.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.807
Well, I mean, it's not that I don't
like David and di, you know.

01:49.901 --> 01:51.687
Guys, it's not
that I don't like you.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.393
It's all right.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.009
And it's not that I don't want to
spend time with you, 'cause I do.

01:56.033 --> 01:59.025
It's just ed
doesn't have too many friends.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.532
Can I get any of you
cunts a drink?

02:05.250 --> 02:07.707
Anybody? Both: No, thank you.

02:09.420 --> 02:13.790
I know friends
are important to Shaun,

02:13.884 --> 02:15.124
but you do actually have to set

02:15.218 --> 02:17.083
some quality time
aside for yourselves.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.465
Yeah, I mean daffs
is always taking me

02:19.556 --> 02:21.012
to see these listed buildings,

02:21.099 --> 02:23.761
and, you know, I'm always
dragging him to the theater.

02:23.852 --> 02:25.012
I'm not so hot on theater.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.456
Dianne: Well, how about
a nice meal?

02:26.480 --> 02:27.790
It's your anniversary
soon, isn't it?

02:27.814 --> 02:28.849
It was last week.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.431
Oh. Did you do anything special?

02:31.526 --> 02:33.892
We came here.
Ed: Shaun. Hog lumps.

02:35.113 --> 02:36.819
Shaun, what I'm trying to say is

02:36.907 --> 02:38.818
I need something more,

02:38.909 --> 02:41.025
more than spending every
night in the Winchester.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.485
I want to get out there
and do more interesting stuff.

02:43.580 --> 02:44.615
I want to live a little.

02:44.706 --> 02:47.823
I want you to want
to want to do it, too.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.661
Listen to me. I'm beginning
to sound like your mum.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.232
Not that I'd know
what she sounds like.

02:53.256 --> 02:54.962
You still haven't met his mum?

02:55.050 --> 02:56.085
Not yet.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.776
Don't you get along
with your mum, Shaun?

02:57.803 --> 02:59.523
No. It's not that I don't
get on with her...

02:59.554 --> 03:01.010
Are you ashamed
by your mum, Shaun?

03:01.098 --> 03:02.508
No, I love my mum.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.260
I love his mum. Shaun: Ed!

03:04.351 --> 03:06.433
She's like butter. Ed!

03:06.520 --> 03:07.520
Both: Shaun! Guys.

03:08.855 --> 03:12.347
Look, I understand what you're
trying to say, okay, and I agree.

03:12.442 --> 03:15.184
We should get out there.
We'll start tomorrow.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.547
All right,
I'll book a restaurant,

03:16.571 --> 03:18.732
you know, the place
that does all the fish.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.860
Just the two of us.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.112
Things will change, I promise.

03:24.121 --> 03:25.611
Really, Shaun?

03:27.457 --> 03:28.822
Bartender: Time, gentlemen.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.104
Man on jukebox: This
town is coming like a ghost town

03:31.128 --> 03:32.459
Shaun?

04:39.863 --> 04:42.354
Male voice on TV: Player two
has entered the game.

04:42.741 --> 04:44.572
Haven't you got work?

04:44.868 --> 04:47.234
Male voice on TV: Player two
has left the game.

05:00.050 --> 05:03.008
You do know the front door
was open again last night.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.634
I'm not saying it was you.
I know, man.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.886
I'm saying it was ed. Right.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.848
I can't live like this.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.646
I mean, just look
at the state of it.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.724
We're not students anymore.
Pete, just...

05:18.819 --> 05:19.921
I mean, it's not like
he even brings

05:19.945 --> 05:21.047
any real money into the house.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.481
Well, he brings a bit.

05:22.572 --> 05:23.903
What, dealing drugs?

05:23.990 --> 05:25.321
Oh, he sells a bit of weed

05:25.408 --> 05:26.648
every now and again, you know.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.903
You've sold puff.

05:27.994 --> 05:30.781
Yeah, once. At college. To you.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.705
Well, look, I've known him since
primary school, you know.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.407
I like having him around,
he's a laugh.

05:35.502 --> 05:38.835
What, because he can impersonate
an orangutan? Fuck-a-doodle-doo.

05:38.922 --> 05:40.253
Oh, leave him alone.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.958
All right, I admit he can be
pretty funny on occasion.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.155
Like that time we stayed up all
night drinking apple schnapps

05:46.179 --> 05:47.214
and playing tekken 2.

05:47.305 --> 05:48.590
Oh, yeah.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.347
When was that?

05:51.434 --> 05:54.597
That was five years ago.
When's he going home?

05:56.898 --> 05:58.513
Hey, man, listen... top left.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.608
Uh-huh.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.309
I was gonna say... reload.
I'm on it.

06:02.779 --> 06:05.065
Since... nice shot. Thanks.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.814
Two seconds.

06:09.995 --> 06:11.915
You all right, noodle?
Hello, mate, got anything?

06:11.955 --> 06:14.287
No, man. But eball
says you was holding.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.998
I ain't got nothing. What? You
ain't got nothing at all?

06:22.549 --> 06:24.085
Listen... ed,

06:24.801 --> 06:26.962
since you're not working
at the moment,

06:27.053 --> 06:29.590
could you please clean up a bit?
Yep.

06:29.681 --> 06:30.867
And if you play
the answer machine,

06:30.891 --> 06:33.348
could you take down everyone's
messages, not just your own?

06:33.435 --> 06:34.641
Yep.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.559
It's not that taxing, is it?

06:36.646 --> 06:39.012
Writing something
on a little scrap of paper?

06:39.107 --> 06:41.098
Nope. Right.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.488
Pete: Dom, hi...
Come on, it was pretty funny.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.650
I ain't doing nothing for him.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.701
Well, do it for me, then.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.739
I'm sorry, Shaun.

06:58.627 --> 06:59.707
It's all right.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.331
No, no. I'm sorry, Shaun.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.759
Ohl

07:07.302 --> 07:09.258
oh, my god, that's rotten.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.066
I'll stop doing them
when you stop laughing.

07:11.806 --> 07:12.950
I am not laughing, I'm going.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.760
Get that. You get it.

07:17.854 --> 07:19.264
Liz: Hello, Shaun, it's me.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.096
Look, I'm gonna be
a bit tied up today,

07:21.191 --> 07:23.853
so when you book the table, can you
make it 8:00 rather than 7:007?

07:23.944 --> 07:25.605
I'll try you at work.
Bye, bye, bye.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.277
Hey! You're dead.

07:40.502 --> 07:41.958
Spare some change,
please, mister?

07:42.045 --> 07:43.330
Yeah.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.711
Watch out. Are you blind?

07:59.729 --> 08:02.391
Man on radio: The American
deep space probe omega six,

08:02.482 --> 08:03.972
due to return
to earth this weekend,

08:04.067 --> 08:06.828
has unexpectedly re-entered earth's
atmosphere over south-east england

08:06.903 --> 08:10.191
and broken apart over what's
believed to be a populated area.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.703
Nelson?

08:29.426 --> 08:30.426
Nelson?

08:33.763 --> 08:36.220
Hello, my friend. No beer today?

08:36.307 --> 08:38.423
No, it's a bit early for me.

08:49.195 --> 08:53.108
Shaun: Gather round, everyone.
Gather round, please.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.234
Gather round.

08:54.325 --> 08:56.941
Now, as well as
Mr. sloman being off today,

08:57.037 --> 09:00.905
I'm afraid ash is feeling a
little bit under the weather.

09:00.999 --> 09:03.456
So, I will be
taking charge, as the...

09:03.543 --> 09:04.874
Oldest.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.872
Senior staff member.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.249
So, if we can all just pull
together, I know that...

09:10.800 --> 09:12.791
Hello? Hello, mate.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.673
Noel... l was totally
munted last night.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.757
Yeah, I spoke to him.
He's only got Henry.

09:21.186 --> 09:23.677
All right, mate. Laters.
Man: Laters.

09:31.654 --> 09:32.769
Continue.

09:32.864 --> 09:33.979
Thank you.

09:35.158 --> 09:40.243
As Mr. sloman always says, "there's no
'l' in team but there is an 'l' in pie.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.446
“In... there's an'l'
in meat pie."

09:42.540 --> 09:43.905
The anagram of "meat" is "team."

09:44.000 --> 09:45.019
I don't know what
he's talking about.

09:45.043 --> 09:48.251
Look, that's it. And, Noel, phones off,
yeah? It's not a social gathering.

09:48.338 --> 09:50.203
All right,
keep your hair on, grandad.

09:50.298 --> 09:54.837
Hey, hey, whoa. I'm 29 for Christ's sakes.
How old are you? 20? 21?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.168
Seventeen.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.718
Hey, well...

09:58.973 --> 10:00.838
Look, I know you don't
wanna be here forever.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.095
I got things
I wanna do with my life.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.517
When?

10:06.397 --> 10:07.978
You got red on you.

10:10.193 --> 10:11.808
Noel: Hello, mate.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.896
This one comes with a basic,
sort of, digital package.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.858
You've got your lifestyle
channels there, a bit of Trisha.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.908
You've got entertainment...
I don't know what that is.

10:23.998 --> 10:29.743
News. All the basic
news channels.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.791
Coming after me like this...

10:31.881 --> 10:33.609
Female reporter: Believed
to be caused by exposure...

10:33.633 --> 10:35.999
Noel: Shaun.
Yeah, I'm with customers.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.126
It's your dad.

10:39.055 --> 10:42.172
He's not my dad,
he's my stepdad.

10:45.395 --> 10:46.601
Philip.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.434
Shaun.

10:52.569 --> 10:55.436
I trust you haven't forgotten
about tomorrow.

10:55.738 --> 10:58.320
No. Your bi-monthly visit.

10:58.408 --> 10:59.648
No, I haven't forgotten.

10:59.742 --> 11:00.928
Perhaps you could
bring the flowers

11:00.952 --> 11:03.318
you forgot to bring Barbara
on mother's day.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.448
I was gonna.

11:04.539 --> 11:07.576
And not a cheap posy
from a garage forecourt.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.248
I wasn't gonna.

11:12.547 --> 11:15.163
Well, we look forward
to seeing you tomorrow, then.

11:15.258 --> 11:16.464
Okay.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.132
You've got red on you.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.677
I thought you said this
wasn't a social gathering?

11:28.771 --> 11:29.886
What?

11:29.981 --> 11:32.188
How comes you're allowed
to speak to your dad?

11:32.275 --> 11:35.733
A, he's not my dad, okay?
He's my stepdad.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.857
And b, it was an emergency.

11:38.948 --> 11:41.690
What, like buying
your mum some flowers?

11:41.784 --> 11:43.524
Noel, no matter
what you might think, okay,

11:43.620 --> 11:44.951
I do not find it difficult

11:45.038 --> 11:47.029
to keep my work
and my social life separate.

11:47.123 --> 11:49.409
Shaun. It's Liz for you.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.248
Hello. L1z: Hello, it's me.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.422
Hello. Just quickly, did
you get my message?

11:57.508 --> 11:58.543
Yep.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.796
Oh, so it's all okay, then? Yep.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.407
8:00, the place
that does all the fish?

12:02.472 --> 12:03.678
Yeah.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.723
Oh, cool, well, that's great.
Just ring me later.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.346
Goodbye, Liz.
Bye. Bye, bye, bye.

12:11.105 --> 12:14.313
Liz from head office.
It's nothing to panic about.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.687
Sir? Sir?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.440
Sorry. They're for my mum.

12:24.327 --> 12:29.287
"To a wonderful mum"
or "pow! Super mum"?

12:29.374 --> 12:31.740
The first one. Right.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.418
Oh, my god! Jesus!

13:17.505 --> 13:19.370
Shaun! Yvonne.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.633
How are you doing? Surviving.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.130
So, are you living round here?

13:25.221 --> 13:26.301
Um, yeah, are you?

13:26.389 --> 13:28.300
Yeah, I've just bought
a place, actually.

13:28.391 --> 13:31.474
Bought?
I know, bit grown up, eh?

13:31.561 --> 13:33.722
Are you still with... Liz.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.395
That's great.
Glad somebody made it.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.143
How long's that been now?

13:38.234 --> 13:41.101
It's three years ago
last week, actually.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.560
Did you do anything special?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.655
Well, we're going out
for a meal tonight, actually.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.402
Oh, anywhere nice?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.241
Yeah.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.827
Come on!

13:59.630 --> 14:01.712
Are you gonna thank me, then?
For what?

14:01.799 --> 14:03.164
Tidying up.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.874
Well, it doesn't look that tidy.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.584
Well, I had a few beers
when I finished.

14:06.679 --> 14:09.386
Man on phone: Hello, fulci's.
Can you hold, please? Yeah.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.840
Do you want your messages? What?

14:11.934 --> 14:14.471
Well, your mum rang about
going round tomorrow night.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.474
And then Liz rang about the two
of you eating out tonight.

14:17.565 --> 14:20.326
And then your mum rang back to see
if I wanted to eat her out tonight.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.691
What? Hello, fulci's.

14:21.778 --> 14:23.188
Yeah, hi.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.270
I know this is really
short notice and everything,

14:25.365 --> 14:28.857
but could you possibly do me a table
for two for tonight at about 8:00?

14:28.951 --> 14:31.533
No, sorry, we just gave
away the last table.

14:31.621 --> 14:32.621
God!

14:37.168 --> 14:38.374
Wasn't true about your mum.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.417
What am I gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

14:40.546 --> 14:43.379
The Winchester. Don't be stupid!
They don't do food.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.110
There's a breville out back.
John'll do you a toastie.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.374
Ed, this is serious!

14:47.804 --> 14:49.294
Hello. Liz: Hello, it's me.

14:49.389 --> 14:50.389
Hello.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.429
So, what's the plan, then?

14:54.227 --> 14:57.094
Yeah, there's been a bit of a
mix-up with the table, babe.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.349
What do you mean?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.146
They're... they're full up.

15:01.234 --> 15:03.850
But I thought you said
it was all okay!

15:03.945 --> 15:05.151
Yeah.

15:05.947 --> 15:08.404
You didn't book it,
did you, Shaun?

15:08.491 --> 15:09.491
No.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.941
So, what is the plan, then?

15:16.374 --> 15:17.739
The Winchester?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.583
Dianne on speaker: Hello.

15:24.674 --> 15:25.901
Dianne, can you
let me in, please?

15:25.925 --> 15:27.961
I'm not sure
this is the best time, Shaun.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.087
Oh, come on.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.464
David: Lizzie doesn't want
to see you, Shaun. Go away.

15:31.556 --> 15:32.591
Just open the door!

15:32.682 --> 15:35.640
She doesn't want
to see you, Shaun.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.162
What do you want me to do?
Do you want me to go...

15:37.186 --> 15:38.586
Do you want me
to climb up the wall,

15:38.646 --> 15:40.352
come through the window?
'Cause I will.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.520
You're not coming in.

15:41.649 --> 15:45.062
I... all right. See you in a minute.
Don't...

15:57.540 --> 15:59.246
Shaun: Hi, it's me again.

15:59.834 --> 16:02.120
Liz, can we just talk about this?
You know, let's go out.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.452
What, to the Winchester?
Well... do you want to?

16:04.547 --> 16:05.912
No, I don't fucking want to!

16:06.007 --> 16:07.338
Okay.
I just thought, you know...

16:07.425 --> 16:09.145
It's not the only place
in the world, Shaun!

16:09.218 --> 16:12.881
Well, we could go to the Shepherd's,
then, they do thai in there now.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.337
I'm going out with David and di.

16:14.432 --> 16:15.492
Well, let's all go together.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.702
What, you hang out
with my friends?

16:16.726 --> 16:19.433
Sorry, a failed actress and a twat?
Well, that's harsh.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.929
Your words. I did not call
dianne a failed actress.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.355
Let's just go out, you know.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.044
Let's just go out somewhere
and have a laugh.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.649
Things'll be fine, I promise.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.256
You promised you'd stop
smoking when I did.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.145
What... you promised you'd
go back to the gym!

16:31.240 --> 16:32.885
I... you promised you'd
try drinking red wine

16:32.909 --> 16:33.909
instead of beer! Well...

16:33.951 --> 16:35.262
You promised you'd come
on holiday with me.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.617
We went to Greece, didn't we?

16:36.704 --> 16:38.114
We met in Greece.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.822
At a rave.
It's just not the same.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.498
You promised things
would change.

16:42.585 --> 16:43.812
You promised
you'd get us free cable.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.497
I'm working on that. Okay.

16:45.588 --> 16:47.566
Well, I can give up smoking.
I can give up whenever I want.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.672
Look, see. Don't need them.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.967
What was the next one?

16:53.054 --> 16:54.669
It's not enough, Shaun.

17:02.730 --> 17:04.846
Basically, I'd say
your nine lives are up, Shaun.

17:04.941 --> 17:06.727
Get fucked, four-eyes!

17:06.817 --> 17:09.433
Why don't you go out with her,
you love her so much?

17:09.529 --> 17:11.484
What do you mean by that?

17:12.573 --> 17:14.593
Male reporter on TV: The
devastation really is extensive.

17:14.617 --> 17:17.233
It really is a total mess.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.785
I don't know
what he meant by that.

17:23.334 --> 17:24.949
Shaun: Got you these.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.708
To a wonderful mum?

17:33.803 --> 17:36.294
Yeah.

17:36.389 --> 17:40.382
Yeah, that's because
I thought it would be funny

17:40.476 --> 17:43.058
because of what you said last
night about me, you know,

17:43.145 --> 17:44.498
you don't wanna be
my mum and that,

17:44.522 --> 17:45.624
and it's just a little joke.

17:45.648 --> 17:48.981
It's something I just thought
of, spur of the moment.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.651
They're for your mum, aren't they?
Yeah.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.069
Smooth.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.142
Look, if I don't do something,

18:04.166 --> 18:05.497
I'm gonna end up in that pub,

18:05.585 --> 18:06.812
every night,
for the rest of my life,

18:06.836 --> 18:08.730
like those other sad old fuckers,
drinking myself to death,

18:08.754 --> 18:11.120
wondering what
the hell happened.

18:12.967 --> 18:15.003
What do you mean,
"do something"?

18:48.502 --> 18:50.117
Fuck her!

18:50.212 --> 18:54.751
You got your pint. You got your pig snacks.
What more do you want?

18:56.427 --> 18:59.339
Oh. Your favorite monkey?

19:00.765 --> 19:02.380
Shall I do Clyde?

19:14.779 --> 19:17.065
See, I knew you'd get over her.

19:28.209 --> 19:30.165
Who the hell put this on?

19:30.252 --> 19:31.742
It's on random.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.247
Ah, for fuck's sake.
John, yes, please, mate.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.253
You know what we
should do tomorrow?

19:42.348 --> 19:45.840
Keep drinking. We'll have a
bloody Mary first thing.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.120
Have a bite at the king's head,

19:47.144 --> 19:48.805
couple at the little Princess,

19:48.896 --> 19:50.761
we'll stagger back here
and bang,

19:50.856 --> 19:52.471
we're back at the bar for shots.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.306
How's that
for a slice of fried gold?

19:54.402 --> 19:56.814
No. Come on, man.

19:59.323 --> 20:00.688
Talk to me.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.694
She said if she stayed with me,

20:02.785 --> 20:04.446
she'd end up
coming in here, every night,

20:04.537 --> 20:08.200
for the rest of her life, like these sad
old fuckers, drinking herself to death,

20:08.290 --> 20:10.121
wondering what
the hell happened.

20:10.209 --> 20:14.168
That is harsh. These are rich,
interesting characters.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.495
Like who?

20:18.467 --> 20:24.087
Snakehips. Always surrounded by women.
He's a bigamist.

20:24.181 --> 20:27.389
Strangled his first wife
with a draught excluder.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.842
And he invented
the mobile disco.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.679
Well, what about her, then?

20:33.983 --> 20:35.939
Cockacidal maniac.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.277
She's an ex-porn star.
She's done it all.

20:40.364 --> 20:44.027
They say she starred in the world's
first interracial hardcore loop.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.779
Café au lait.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.364
Pour vous.

20:50.499 --> 20:53.457
Yeah. What about John, then?

20:53.544 --> 20:54.829
He's north London mafia.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.953
It's true, big al says so.

20:58.048 --> 21:01.757
Yeah, well, big al also says
dogs can't look up.

21:01.844 --> 21:05.507
Think about it. Handy with a blade.
Gruff demeanor.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.431
Bernie, the trophy wife.
He's connected.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.162
Why do you think
there's a rifle above the bar?

21:10.186 --> 21:12.142
'Cause the pub's
called the Winchester.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.514
Exactly.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.597
See, you don't need Liz
to have a good time.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.273
Oh, ed, don't, man.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.854
No. Look at me.
Can I just say one more thing?

21:22.948 --> 21:24.068
I'm not gonna say, you know,

21:24.116 --> 21:26.027
"there's plenty more fish
in the sea."

21:26.118 --> 21:28.359
I'm not gonna say,
"if you love her let her go."

21:28.454 --> 21:30.740
And I'm not gonna bombard you
with clichés.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.947
But what I will say is this,

21:34.668 --> 21:35.948
"it's not the end of the world."

21:42.009 --> 21:43.840
Sorry, we're closed.

21:47.306 --> 21:48.306
Pisshead.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.454
Bass bass

21:53.896 --> 21:55.807
white lines. White lines.

21:55.898 --> 21:57.542
Visions, dreams of passion
visions, dreams of passion

21:57.566 --> 21:59.932
blowing through my mind
blowing through my mind

22:00.027 --> 22:01.213
and all the while
and all the while

22:01.237 --> 22:02.297
I think of you. I think of you.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.561
High... high...

22:04.657 --> 22:07.399
What's wrong,
haven't you had your tea?

22:08.244 --> 22:09.324
Something something

22:09.411 --> 22:10.806
of a phenomenon, baby
of a phenomenon, baby

22:10.830 --> 22:12.724
telling my body to come along
telling my body to come along

22:12.748 --> 22:15.660
'cause white lines
'cause white lines

22:15.751 --> 22:17.582
blow away blow away

22:19.922 --> 22:21.002
blow

22:22.299 --> 22:24.005
get higher, baby

22:24.093 --> 22:26.004
get higher, baby

22:26.095 --> 22:27.335
get higher, girl

22:38.065 --> 22:39.680
What's he doing?
He should say "bass."

22:39.775 --> 22:42.187
Or "freeze."

22:42.278 --> 22:43.609
What a tit.

22:53.289 --> 22:54.870
You wanna dance?

23:02.798 --> 23:04.959
Hey, don't scratch it! Wait.

23:07.136 --> 23:08.751
That was the second album
I ever bought!

23:08.846 --> 23:11.212
It's 4:00
in the fucking morning!

23:11.307 --> 23:12.387
It's Saturday!

23:12.474 --> 23:14.180
No, it's not.
It's fucking Sunday,

23:14.268 --> 23:16.508
and I've got to go to fucking
work in four fucking hours,

23:16.562 --> 23:20.054
because every other fucker in my
fucking department is fucking ill!

23:20.149 --> 23:23.391
Now can you see
why I'm so fucking angry?

23:23.485 --> 23:25.146
Fuck, yeah! Hey.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.569
Pete, look, I'm...
You know, I'm sorry.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.521
We just...
We've had a couple of drinks.

23:29.617 --> 23:31.824
We split up with Liz tonight.

23:33.454 --> 23:35.445
Just keep it down, yeah?

23:36.582 --> 23:37.788
Prick.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.159
What was that? Nothing.

23:42.046 --> 23:43.481
No, no, no, come on, stop it.
We're friends!

23:43.505 --> 23:45.621
He's not my friend.
He's a fucking idiot!

23:45.716 --> 23:46.860
What's that supposed to mean?

23:46.884 --> 23:49.091
It means,
why don't you fuck off?

23:49.178 --> 23:50.363
You wanna live like an animal,

23:50.387 --> 23:52.753
go and live in the shed,
you thick fuck!

23:52.848 --> 23:54.088
Oh, leave him alone!

23:54.183 --> 23:56.219
Stop defending him, Shaun!

23:56.310 --> 23:58.050
All he ever does
is hold you back!

23:58.145 --> 23:59.831
Or does it make your life
easier having someone around

23:59.855 --> 24:02.392
who's more of a loser than you?

24:02.483 --> 24:03.768
What's that supposed to mean?

24:03.859 --> 24:05.690
You know what I mean.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.520
I assume it was Liz
who did the dumping?

24:09.531 --> 24:12.614
Sort your fucking
life out, mate!

24:12.701 --> 24:14.942
What's up with your hand, man?

24:16.038 --> 24:17.903
I got mugged
on the way home from work.

24:17.998 --> 24:18.998
By who?

24:19.083 --> 24:21.227
I don't know, some crackheads or something.
One of them bit me.

24:21.251 --> 24:22.457
Why did they bite you?

24:22.544 --> 24:25.411
I don't know.
I didn't stop to ask them!

24:25.506 --> 24:27.667
Now, I've got
a splitting headache

24:27.758 --> 24:30.625
and your stupid
hip-hop isn't helping.

24:30.719 --> 24:33.085
And the front door
is open again!

24:34.598 --> 24:38.841
It's not hip-hop.
It's electro. Prick.

24:38.936 --> 24:41.268
Next time I see him, he's dead.

24:52.741 --> 24:54.652
Liz: Hello, Shaun, it's me.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.324
Look, I'm gonna be
a bit tied up today,

24:56.412 --> 24:59.119
so when you book the table, can you
make it 8:00 rather than 7:007?

24:59.206 --> 25:01.572
I'll try you at work.
Bye, bye, bye.

25:02.835 --> 25:06.123
Barbara: Hello, pickle.
It's me, mum.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.544
Dad said he saw you
in town today

25:07.631 --> 25:09.067
and mentioned you might be
visiting tomorrow,

25:09.091 --> 25:10.547
which would be lovely.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.421
Will you be bringing Elizabeth
with you this time?

25:13.512 --> 25:15.343
Only, we can't wait
to meet her finally,

25:15.431 --> 25:20.846
and also, I was wondering if she
wanted anything special for lunch.

25:20.936 --> 25:23.643
'Cause these days
lots of people don't eat meat.

25:39.246 --> 25:41.282
Do you want anything
from the shop?

25:41.373 --> 25:42.658
Cornetto.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.025
Nelson, have you got any papers?

26:55.739 --> 27:00.483
Nelson? I haven't even...
I owe you about fifteen p.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.358
Oh, dear.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.612
Sorry, I haven't got any change.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.533
I didn't even have enough
at the fucking shop, so...

27:42.619 --> 27:43.904
Oh, dear.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.629
Although no-one official
is prepared to comment,

27:56.717 --> 27:59.459
religious groups are calling
it judgment day. There's...

27:59.553 --> 28:02.260
Panic on
the streets of London...

28:02.347 --> 28:04.679
As an increasing number
of reports of...

28:04.766 --> 28:06.244
Sports commentator:
Serious attacks on...

28:06.268 --> 28:07.724
People,
who are literally being...

28:07.811 --> 28:08.971
Narrator: Eaten alive.

28:09.062 --> 28:11.223
Eyewitness reports are sketchy.

28:11.315 --> 28:13.397
One unifying detail seems to be

28:13.483 --> 28:16.350
that the attackers in many
instances, appear to be...

28:16.445 --> 28:17.797
Dead excited
to have with us here,

28:17.821 --> 28:19.937
a sensational chart-topping...

28:20.032 --> 28:24.150
Or ideological connection between
those committing the atrocities,

28:24.244 --> 28:25.825
and perhaps, more alarmingly...

28:25.913 --> 28:28.780
Ed: There's a girl in the garden.
Their behavior.

28:29.124 --> 28:30.284
What?

28:31.793 --> 28:33.408
In the garden, there is a girl.

28:33.503 --> 28:35.539
The armed forces
will be called in

28:35.631 --> 28:38.043
to provide back-up
and assistance.

28:38.133 --> 28:40.545
Scientists are still
trying to establish

28:40.636 --> 28:43.469
the cause and nature
of the phenomenon.

28:46.767 --> 28:48.098
Excuse me.

28:51.647 --> 28:53.183
Excuse me.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.436
Hello.

29:02.157 --> 29:03.863
What are you doing?

29:23.011 --> 29:24.501
Oh, my god.

29:27.015 --> 29:28.596
She's so drunk.

29:32.646 --> 29:34.557
How much have you had, love?

29:34.648 --> 29:36.184
Oh, I think she likes you.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.275
Shut up.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.940
I think she wants a cuddle.

29:39.027 --> 29:41.308
Listen, I'm serious. I've just
come out of a relationship.

29:43.073 --> 29:45.109
Ed, do something. Wait there.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.736
Ed! Two seconds.

29:46.827 --> 29:49.694
Jeez, look, I'm really flattered and
everything, really, but I just...

29:51.790 --> 29:54.122
And hold it there.

29:54.209 --> 29:57.372
Ed, just get her off me! Jesus!

29:59.131 --> 30:01.793
Whoa. What's up with her eyes?
What's up with her eyes?

30:01.883 --> 30:05.341
Now seriously, Mary,
I'm warning you, okay.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.761
I'm gonna have to get physical.
I mean it!

30:07.848 --> 30:10.555
This is it. I'm gonna...
Look, just fuck off!

30:44.426 --> 30:46.087
I think we should go
back inside.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.384
Okay.

30:55.854 --> 30:56.934
Shaun, what's going on?

30:57.022 --> 30:59.013
Shit, it's engaged.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.313
How about an ambulance?

31:00.400 --> 31:01.936
It's engaged, ed.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.442
Fire engine?

31:04.529 --> 31:06.690
It's one number, ed,
and it's busy. Okay?

31:06.782 --> 31:08.693
What do you want
a fire engine for, anyway?

31:08.784 --> 31:11.196
Anything with flashing lights,
you know.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.992
Are they still out there?

31:20.420 --> 31:23.002
Yeah. What do you think
we should do?

31:24.174 --> 31:25.710
Have a sit down?

31:25.801 --> 31:28.543
There are reports
of chaos on the motorways

31:28.637 --> 31:31.674
as thousands of people attempt
to flee the cities.

31:31.765 --> 31:35.383
The m1, the m3, m4, m6...

31:35.477 --> 31:36.887
Do you think
this is the same thing?

31:36.978 --> 31:40.562
And m68 are all at a standstill.

31:40.649 --> 31:42.605
The home office
has issued a statement

31:42.692 --> 31:44.933
urging people to stay
in their homes

31:45.028 --> 31:46.609
and await further instruction.

31:46.696 --> 31:49.438
Ensure all residences are secure

31:49.533 --> 31:54.493
with all doors and windows firmly
locked and barricaded. Police...

31:56.665 --> 31:58.075
Fucking hell!

31:58.166 --> 32:00.532
Shaun: Oh, for god's sake.
Oh, he's got an arm off!

32:00.627 --> 32:02.083
Get him!

32:09.344 --> 32:10.459
Yeah.

32:15.142 --> 32:18.384
Male reporter: More reports just
in confirm that in all cases

32:18.478 --> 32:21.311
the attackers seem slow
and shambolic.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.392
I'm gonna shut the front door.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.269
Receive information
from the home office,

32:25.360 --> 32:28.944
regarding the best way
to neutralize the attackers.

32:29.030 --> 32:34.115
In the meantime, contact with these
assailants is highly inadvisable.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.282
Did you see his head go?

32:35.370 --> 32:36.370
If you're confronted

32:36.455 --> 32:37.815
and have the opportunity
fo escape,

32:39.040 --> 32:41.060
it is suggested that you do so
as quickly as possible.

32:41.084 --> 32:42.084
We should get out there.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.705
No, no, no, no,
we should stay inside.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.126
Come on, we can take them.

32:45.213 --> 32:46.357
But the man said
to stay indoors.

32:46.381 --> 32:47.496
Oh, fuck the man.

32:47.591 --> 32:48.693
Look, as long
as they're out there

32:48.717 --> 32:50.207
and we're in here, we're safe.

32:51.386 --> 32:52.905
Officials suggest that
in extreme circumstances,

32:52.929 --> 32:54.635
the attackers can be stopped

32:54.723 --> 32:58.181
by removing the head
or destroying the brain.

32:58.268 --> 33:04.059
I'll repeat that, by removing the
head or destroying the brain.

33:09.779 --> 33:11.144
Hey.

33:14.910 --> 33:16.525
Aim for the head.

33:35.222 --> 33:37.508
Well, now what? We'll
have to get more stuff.

33:37.599 --> 33:39.399
What's in the shed?
I don't know. It's locked.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.037
Why is it locked?
It's always been locked.

33:41.061 --> 33:43.393
Well, you know, we're gonna...

33:43.480 --> 33:44.480
On.

33:44.564 --> 33:47.601
No, no, that's the second
album I ever bought! Don't!

33:54.241 --> 33:55.697
Now, some of these
are limited...

33:55.784 --> 33:57.240
What was that? What was that?

33:57.327 --> 33:58.612
I think it was blue Monday.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.318
Man, that was
an original pressing.

34:00.413 --> 34:01.903
Oh, for fuck's sake.

34:03.291 --> 34:04.371
Purple rain? No.

34:04.459 --> 34:05.686
Sign o' the times?
Definitely not.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.871
The Batman soundtrack? Throw it.

34:10.632 --> 34:13.123
Okay. Oh, dire straits?
Throw it.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.721
The stone roses? No.

34:22.811 --> 34:24.391
Sade? That's Liz's.

34:24.478 --> 34:26.594
Yeah, but she did dump you. Oh.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.146
Oh, fuck this.
I'm going to the shed.

34:29.234 --> 34:31.270
I thought you said
it was locked.

34:41.830 --> 34:43.570
Which one do you want?
Girl or bloke?

34:43.665 --> 34:45.201
The first one.

35:04.352 --> 35:06.468
Male reporter: In all
cases, people receiving bites

35:06.563 --> 35:08.849
have experienced
headaches and nausea,

35:08.940 --> 35:11.022
and developed symptoms
similar to those displayed...

35:11.109 --> 35:12.837
You've got red on you.
By their attackers.

35:12.861 --> 35:15.147
If you know someone
who has been bitten,

35:15.238 --> 35:17.103
it is absolutely essential

35:17.198 --> 35:19.234
that you isolate
them immediately.

35:20.243 --> 35:24.452
The public are being strongly
advised not to approach anyone...

35:24.539 --> 35:25.779
Pete?

35:28.418 --> 35:29.828
Pete?

35:29.919 --> 35:32.535
Why don't we just go up?
Oh, no, don't go up there.

35:32.631 --> 35:35.338
Why not? Because a, he
might be one of them.

35:35.425 --> 35:37.791
And b,
he might still be annoyed.

35:38.887 --> 35:40.047
Pete?

35:41.139 --> 35:42.879
Maybe he went in to work.

35:42.974 --> 35:46.137
How come he didn't drive?
His keys are still here.

35:46.227 --> 35:47.342
Well, maybe he got a lift.

35:47.437 --> 35:49.052
He said he wasn't
feeling very well.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.808
Pete?

35:50.899 --> 35:52.059
Prick!

35:53.902 --> 35:55.563
He's not in. He's not in.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.694
You got a fag?
No, I've given up.

35:58.782 --> 36:00.738
Since when? Since...

36:03.745 --> 36:07.112
Come on, babe.
Oh, she's engaged.

36:07.207 --> 36:08.743
That was quick.
Ed, this is serious!

36:09.918 --> 36:11.374
Liz! Barbara: Shaun.

36:11.461 --> 36:14.328
Mum! Hi. I was gonna call you.
Are you okay?

36:14.422 --> 36:16.504
Yes. Yeah, well, are you sure?

36:16.591 --> 36:19.003
Some men tried to get
into the house.

36:19.094 --> 36:20.675
Well, are they still there?

36:20.762 --> 36:23.003
I'm not sure.
We've shut the curtains.

36:23.098 --> 36:24.508
Well, did you try the police?

36:24.599 --> 36:26.715
Well, I thought about it.

36:26.810 --> 36:28.290
Well, are you okay?
Did they hurt you?

36:28.353 --> 36:30.810
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

36:30.897 --> 36:34.890
Mum? Well, they
were a bit bitey.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.397
Mum, have you been bitten?

36:38.488 --> 36:40.729
No, but Philip has.

36:40.824 --> 36:41.859
Oh, okay.

36:41.950 --> 36:43.565
Has she been bitten?
No, Philip has.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.696
Oh, okay. Listen, mum, what
sort of state is he in?

36:45.787 --> 36:49.120
Oh, he's fine.
Bit under the weather.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.868
I see. What's the deal?

36:50.959 --> 36:52.244
We may have to kill my stepdad.

36:52.335 --> 36:53.396
Listen, mum, sit tight, okay?

36:53.420 --> 36:55.160
You're not safe there.
We're coming over.

36:55.255 --> 36:56.836
I don't want to cause a fuss.

36:56.923 --> 36:58.959
We're coming
to get you, Barbara!

37:00.802 --> 37:02.633
So, what's the plan?

37:04.472 --> 37:05.507
Right.

37:07.142 --> 37:10.134
Shaun: We take Pete's car,
we drive over to mum's.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.468
We go in.

37:12.480 --> 37:15.472
We take care of Philip.
I'm so sorry, Philip.

37:15.567 --> 37:18.354
Then we grab mum.
We go over to Liz's place.

37:18.445 --> 37:20.185
Hole up, have a cup of tea.

37:20.280 --> 37:22.396
And wait for all this
to blow over.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.107
Why have we got to go to Liz's?

37:25.201 --> 37:26.281
Because we do.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.575
She dumped you!

37:27.662 --> 37:29.402
I have to know
if she's all right.

37:29.497 --> 37:31.704
Why? Because I love her!

37:33.835 --> 37:36.793
All right, gay.
I'm not staying there though.

37:36.880 --> 37:37.915
Why not?

37:38.006 --> 37:40.372
If we hole up, I want to be
somewhere familiar.

37:40.467 --> 37:41.923
I want to know
where the exits are,

37:42.010 --> 37:44.717
and I wanna be allowed to smoke.

37:44.804 --> 37:45.839
Okay.

37:47.182 --> 37:50.595
Take Pete's car,
go round mum's. Go in.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.846
Deal with Philip. Sorry, Philip.

37:52.937 --> 37:56.771
Grab mum, go to Liz's, pick
her up, bring her back here,

37:56.858 --> 37:59.816
have a cup of tea, and wait
for all this to blow over.

38:00.528 --> 38:01.984
Perfick.

38:02.071 --> 38:05.063
No, no, no, no, no, wait,
we can't bring them back here.

38:05.158 --> 38:07.194
Why not? Well, it's not
exactly safe, is it?

38:07.285 --> 38:09.697
Yeah. Look at the state of it.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.739
Where's safe? Where's familiar?

38:13.833 --> 38:15.198
Where can I smoke?

38:20.381 --> 38:22.337
Shaun: Take car, go to mum's.

38:22.425 --> 38:23.835
Kill Phil. Sorry.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.293
Grab Liz, go to the Winchester,

38:26.387 --> 38:29.925
have a nice cold pint, and wait
for all this to blow over.

38:31.893 --> 38:34.009
How's that
for a slice of fried gold?

38:34.103 --> 38:35.934
Yeah, boy!

38:36.022 --> 38:39.139
To recap, it is vital that
you stay in your homes.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.816
Make no attempt
to reach loved ones

38:41.903 --> 38:45.316
and avoid all physical contact
with the assailants.

38:45.406 --> 38:47.897
Do you believe everything
you hear on TV?

38:50.245 --> 38:52.702
Yeah, I can see if, I can see it.
It's just outside.

38:52.789 --> 38:54.654
Any zombies out there?

38:55.625 --> 38:57.661
Don't say that. What?

38:57.752 --> 38:59.583
That. What?

38:59.671 --> 39:02.128
That. The z word. Don't say it.

39:02.215 --> 39:04.797
Why not?
Because it's ridiculous.

39:04.884 --> 39:06.044
All right.

39:07.262 --> 39:09.253
Are there any out there, though?

39:10.265 --> 39:13.553
Can't see any. Maybe it's
not as bad as all that.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.508
Oh, no, there they are.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.099
Okay, let's do this, yeah?

39:19.190 --> 39:20.270
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

39:20.358 --> 39:22.394
Yeah? I got to do a wee first.

39:23.069 --> 39:24.980
Can I drive?

39:25.572 --> 39:27.688
What? I've always wanted
to drive Pete's car.

39:27.782 --> 39:30.774
I might not get another chance.
Okay.

40:04.986 --> 40:09.446
Oh, god. Sorry, Pete. Listen, we're
gonna borrow your car, okay?

40:11.075 --> 40:15.535
We'll bring it back. And if you're
feeling better later we're...

40:15.622 --> 40:16.657
We're going to the pub.

40:16.748 --> 40:19.330
So, you're more than welcome to

40:21.252 --> 40:22.492
join us.

40:30.386 --> 40:33.093
Pete'd be so pissed off if he
knew I was driving his car, eh?

40:33.181 --> 40:34.671
I don't think so.

40:36.517 --> 40:39.054
Shaun, Shaun, which
button's central locking?

40:45.860 --> 40:46.975
Cock it!

40:48.196 --> 40:49.481
Get lost!

41:04.379 --> 41:05.539
Drive.

41:07.757 --> 41:08.817
Woman on radio:
The church of england

41:08.841 --> 41:11.799
has now joined other
extremist religious groups

41:11.886 --> 41:13.296
in proclaiming the phenomenon,

41:13.388 --> 41:14.798
a sign of a coming apocalypse...

41:14.889 --> 41:16.129
Dad.

41:16.224 --> 41:19.512
Although downing street is refusing
to be drawn into a religious debate.

41:19.602 --> 41:23.561
Once again, the bodies of the recently
deceased are returning to life

41:23.648 --> 41:25.309
and attacking the living.

41:25.400 --> 41:27.211
There is no indication as to...
Let's put something else on.

41:29.112 --> 41:30.477
what are you doing? What?

41:30.571 --> 41:32.061
Ed, look out!

41:36.244 --> 41:37.984
I think we hit something.

41:40.456 --> 41:41.821
Or someone.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.549
Are you all right?

41:54.721 --> 41:56.586
Come on, let's just go.

41:57.807 --> 41:58.842
Hello?

41:58.933 --> 41:59.994
He's gonna be dead either way.

42:00.018 --> 42:02.100
Ed, that's not the point.

42:08.234 --> 42:09.394
Oh, thank god for that.

42:14.741 --> 42:19.235
Ah, hello.
Who's a pretty boy, then?

42:23.291 --> 42:24.747
You didn't tell me
Barbara had a jag.

42:24.834 --> 42:26.594
Oh, I've always wanted
to drive one of those.

42:26.627 --> 42:27.771
Yeah, well, it's Philip's, okay?

42:27.795 --> 42:28.897
And he won't let
anybody near it.

42:28.921 --> 42:30.482
Honestly, I put half a Mars
bar in the glove box once,

42:30.506 --> 42:32.151
and he chased me round the
garden with a bit of wood.

42:32.175 --> 42:34.257
Fuck, it's gorgeous.

42:34.343 --> 42:36.834
Okay, well, it seems pretty
clear, we should go.

42:36.929 --> 42:39.466
Why don't I stay here?

42:39.557 --> 42:41.548
What, what, what, what, what?

42:41.642 --> 42:43.678
You know,
just look after the car.

42:43.811 --> 42:46.302
If there's any
problems, I'll honk three times.

42:47.982 --> 42:49.142
Okay.

42:53.654 --> 42:55.815
Don't forget to kill Philip!
What?

42:57.241 --> 42:59.323
Hello, pickle. Hi, mum.

43:00.161 --> 43:02.493
Oh, you've got red on you. Yeah.

43:02.580 --> 43:04.912
Look, mum, is everything okay?
Are you all right?

43:04.999 --> 43:07.536
Yes, I'm fine. Where's Philip?

43:07.627 --> 43:09.492
Dad's in the lounge.
He's not my dad.

43:09.587 --> 43:10.918
Oh, Shaun, really.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.791
Sorry. Mum, look,
I've got ed outside.

43:12.882 --> 43:13.984
We're gonna take you
somewhere safe.

43:14.008 --> 43:15.368
But we have to wait
for the doctor.

43:15.426 --> 43:16.737
Mum, I don't think
the doctor's gonna come.

43:16.761 --> 43:18.739
I don't think Philip's going to
want to leave the house, darling.

43:18.763 --> 43:20.549
Mum, Philip isn't...

43:21.182 --> 43:23.924
Put the kettle on,
and I'll deal with Philip.

43:24.018 --> 43:25.758
Okay. Okay, then.

43:25.853 --> 43:27.593
Are you hungry?
Yeah. No, not really!

43:27.688 --> 43:30.100
I'll make some sandwiches. Okay.

43:31.275 --> 43:33.061
No fighting, you two.

43:34.362 --> 43:38.025
Man on TV: You may ask
"where is our god?"

43:38.783 --> 43:40.193
But throughout the land,

43:40.284 --> 43:45.529
men and women of integrity rise
up to confront the unseen enemy.

43:47.083 --> 43:52.203
They will not be cowards, they will
be courageous in the face of danger.

43:59.053 --> 44:00.168
I'm so sorry, Philip.

44:00.221 --> 44:01.824
Ess en err re tree ne ses arses
eres ae es re eis ss si ee

44:01.848 --> 44:03.384
what have you done now?

44:03.474 --> 44:05.305
Nothing.
What have you got there?

44:05.393 --> 44:06.803
Flowers, I hope.

44:06.894 --> 44:08.976
No, it's... cricket bat.

44:09.063 --> 44:10.769
Oh, is that
for the jumble, Shaun?

44:10.857 --> 44:12.017
No. Yes.

44:12.108 --> 44:14.224
There's a box
of your toys upstairs.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.979
I was going to give
them to the jumble.

44:16.070 --> 44:18.026
I took them all
to the tip, Barbara.

44:18.114 --> 44:20.571
Oh, what? Shaun wants
to take us somewhere.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.489
Don't be silly.
I'm not going anywhere.

44:22.577 --> 44:23.846
Well, maybe you
should stay here.

44:23.870 --> 44:25.347
You know, wait for the doctor,
and I'll take mum.

44:25.371 --> 44:26.849
But you said
the doctor wasn't coming.

44:26.873 --> 44:28.613
You didn't call
the doctor, did you?

44:28.708 --> 44:30.394
Well, I thought we ought to be
on the safe side.

44:30.418 --> 44:31.954
I'm quite all right, Barbara.

44:32.044 --> 44:34.501
I ran it under a cold tap.
I really think...

44:34.589 --> 44:36.921
We had our jabs when we
went to the isle of wight.

44:37.049 --> 44:39.461
But, Philip... it's a lot
of overblown nonsense.

44:39.635 --> 44:41.572
A lot of drug nuts running wild.

44:41.596 --> 44:43.073
Still, 1 should get mum away,
you know,

44:43.097 --> 44:44.158
just 'cause,
in case they come back.

44:44.182 --> 44:45.763
I'm not going anywhere
without Philip.

44:45.850 --> 44:49.058
Mum, look, how about that tea?

44:50.396 --> 44:54.560
Mum? How much
do you love Philip?

44:54.650 --> 44:55.730
Two sugars, is it?

44:55.818 --> 44:57.900
I haven't had sugar
in my tea since 1982.

44:57.987 --> 44:59.352
Oh, yes.

44:59.447 --> 45:01.529
Will you cut me
some bread, love?

45:01.616 --> 45:03.902
Mum, look, how much
do you love Philip?

45:03.993 --> 45:06.154
Oh, Shaun, do we have to
go through all that again?

45:06.245 --> 45:07.530
Mum, look, what would you say

45:07.622 --> 45:08.902
if 1 told you
that over the years

45:08.956 --> 45:10.366
Philip's been quite
unkind to me?

45:10.458 --> 45:12.436
Well, you weren't always the
easiest person to live with.

45:12.460 --> 45:14.313
Mum, he chased me around the
garden with a bit of wood!

45:14.337 --> 45:16.202
Well, you did call him
a you-know-what.

45:16.297 --> 45:17.941
Oh, what, did he tell you that?
Yes, he did.

45:17.965 --> 45:19.205
Motherfucker. Shaun.

45:19.300 --> 45:21.211
Sorry, mother, mum.

45:21.302 --> 45:26.547
Look, mum, did you know that on
several occasions he touched me?

45:31.979 --> 45:34.766
That wasn't true. Made it up,
shouldn't have done, sorry.

45:34.857 --> 45:36.084
Mum, you don't
understand, okay...

45:36.108 --> 45:37.548
No, it's you
that doesn't understand.

45:37.610 --> 45:40.101
Philip is my husband and has
been for the last 17 years.

45:40.196 --> 45:42.562
I know you haven't
always seen eye-to-eye,

45:42.657 --> 45:46.241
but I would, at least, expect
you to respect my feelings.

45:46.327 --> 45:47.930
You must be more adult
about these things.

45:47.954 --> 45:52.072
Yeah, come on, Shaun.

45:52.166 --> 45:59.038
There comes a time when
you just got to be a man.

46:07.515 --> 46:10.598
I'm telling you,
it's a fuss over nothing.

46:10.685 --> 46:12.676
Hello, Edward. Hi, Barbara.

46:12.770 --> 46:15.432
Barbara: My, how you've grown.
Yeah, you better believe it.

46:15.523 --> 46:17.559
What happened? Why is he coming?

46:17.650 --> 46:18.981
It wasn't as easy as all that.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.896
God's sake. So, we're
following you, are we”?

46:20.987 --> 46:24.354
No, it's probably best
if we... where's the car?

46:26.909 --> 46:28.774
I pranged it.

46:28.869 --> 46:30.154
You were parked!

46:30.246 --> 46:31.452
Yeah.

46:32.373 --> 46:34.534
I guess we'll have to
take the jag.

46:36.544 --> 46:38.330
Philip... ha

46:38.421 --> 46:39.877
look out!

46:42.091 --> 46:43.422
Philip: Christ!

46:44.969 --> 46:46.129
Ed: Jesus!

46:51.600 --> 46:52.744
Philip, give me the car keys!

46:52.768 --> 46:53.888
You're not driving that car.

46:53.978 --> 46:57.015
Philip! Give me the car keys!

46:57.106 --> 46:58.596
Ed, get mum in the car.

46:58.691 --> 46:59.851
I'm on it.

47:00.860 --> 47:02.646
Shaun: Come on.
No, don't worry about me.

47:02.737 --> 47:04.398
Worry about your mother.

47:04.864 --> 47:06.149
Ed, maybe I should drive.

47:06.240 --> 47:08.105
Man, I've adjusted the seat now.

47:08.200 --> 47:10.737
All right, well, just,
you know, be careful!

47:21.088 --> 47:24.205
Can you please
turn that noise down?

47:24.925 --> 47:28.543
Are you all right, dear?
Would you like another tissue?

47:28.637 --> 47:31.720
I'd be fine, if it weren't
for that bloody racket!

47:31.807 --> 47:34.514
It is a bit loud.
Sorry, Barbara.

47:36.604 --> 47:39.391
You do realize this is
a 20 mile an hour zone.

47:39.482 --> 47:40.767
Oh, yeah.

47:44.111 --> 47:45.111
Here.

47:45.196 --> 47:48.563
Okay, mum, this isn't gonna
take a second, all right?

47:50.284 --> 47:51.845
Philip, have you still got
the child locks on?

47:51.869 --> 47:53.609
Safety first, Shaun.

47:54.747 --> 47:56.237
You can't...

47:58.292 --> 48:01.284
Hey, man, watch the leather.

48:03.089 --> 48:05.455
Listen, okay, keep moving.
If there's any problems...

48:05.549 --> 48:07.414
Yeah, yeah, I'll do the honks.

48:32.701 --> 48:33.941
Dianne on speaker: Hello?

48:36.455 --> 48:37.945
Hello?

49:00.521 --> 49:02.182
Guys, can you let me in, please?

49:02.273 --> 49:05.106
What are you doing?
I've come to get you.

49:18.122 --> 49:19.487
Sorry, what are you doing?

49:19.582 --> 49:20.851
I've come to take you
somewhere safe.

49:20.875 --> 49:23.082
We were perfectly safe
before you arrived.

49:23.169 --> 49:24.204
You don't know that.

49:24.295 --> 49:25.689
Well, there was two of them
out there a minute ago.

49:25.713 --> 49:27.499
How many are there now?

49:27.590 --> 49:28.921
I” lots.

49:29.008 --> 49:31.795
Look, believe me, it only takes one
of them to know you're in here.

49:31.886 --> 49:34.072
Listen, I tried calling, I really
did, but I couldn't get through.

49:34.096 --> 49:35.302
I had to come up with a plan.

49:35.389 --> 49:36.504
Oh, you made a plan.

49:36.599 --> 49:38.201
Look, I don't care what the
telly says, all right,

49:38.225 --> 49:39.385
we have to get out of here.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.872
If we don't, they'll come up here
and they'll tear us to pieces.

49:41.896 --> 49:44.478
And that is really gonna
exacerbate things for all of us.

49:44.565 --> 49:46.305
Shaun... look, Liz,

49:46.400 --> 49:48.311
this is not about you
and me, all right?

49:48.402 --> 49:49.733
This 1s about survival.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.798
We need to be somewhere more
secure, somewhere on the ground,

49:51.822 --> 49:53.687
somewhere we can stay alive.

49:53.782 --> 49:55.898
We're with you, Shaun. What?

49:55.993 --> 49:57.358
We're with you.

49:57.453 --> 49:58.909
I'm not going out there.

49:58.996 --> 50:01.078
Daffs! I don't want
to be torn to pieces,

50:01.165 --> 50:03.497
and I'm sure if you really think
about it, neither do you.

50:03.584 --> 50:04.811
I'm not going
if Liz is not going.

50:04.835 --> 50:05.995
Of course she's going.

50:06.086 --> 50:07.522
Well, I'm not staying here
by myself.

50:07.546 --> 50:08.946
You're going,
aren't you, Elizabeth?

50:09.006 --> 50:10.997
Lizzie? Liz?

50:15.888 --> 50:17.753
All right, flash,
what do you have in mind?

50:17.848 --> 50:19.884
Great, okay,
I've got a car outside,

50:19.975 --> 50:21.636
but it's gonna be
a bit cramped now.

50:21.727 --> 50:23.809
So, has anyone got transport?
Yes, yes.

50:23.938 --> 50:26.600
Great. Where? Oh, no. Well,
I've passed my test.

50:28.108 --> 50:29.108
David?

50:29.193 --> 50:31.935
I don't see the point
of owning a car in London.

50:32.613 --> 50:35.275
Look, okay, just get any blunt
objects together, all right?

50:35.366 --> 50:38.028
If you get cornered, bash them
in the head, that seems to work.

50:38.118 --> 50:40.951
Keep together,
stay sharp and follow me.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.450
So, what...
What's the plan, then?

50:43.541 --> 50:45.452
We're going to the Winchester.

50:50.005 --> 50:51.745
Okay? Let's go.

51:07.773 --> 51:10.105
Come on. Where's the car?

51:14.613 --> 51:16.274
What's up, niggaz?

51:21.662 --> 51:23.473
Okay, apologies for the cramped
conditions, everybody, okay?

51:23.497 --> 51:24.782
Di, stay on David's lap?

51:24.873 --> 51:26.488
Okay.
Philip, hang in there, okay?

51:26.584 --> 51:28.449
Ed, get there fast, yeah? Yeah.

51:28.544 --> 51:30.956
And, mum, this is Liz. Liz, mum.

51:31.046 --> 51:32.331
Hello. Hello.

51:39.054 --> 51:40.089
Ed. Shaun.

51:40.180 --> 51:41.841
I know. Ed, be careful.

51:41.932 --> 51:43.451
Is your dad all right?
He's not my dad.

51:43.475 --> 51:45.887
Dianne: He's bleeding. Yeah, I know.
Ed, just be careful!

51:45.978 --> 51:48.310
Thought you wanted
to get there fast?

51:49.898 --> 51:51.618
I just want to get there
in one piece, okay?

51:51.692 --> 51:52.836
And why are we going this way?

51:52.860 --> 51:54.350
Chill out, it's a shortcut.

51:54.445 --> 51:55.922
But that road goes straight
to the Winchester.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.007
Ge gr ae see ss tees a es see le aar cai ee ee I ee seta ee paa fa

51:57.031 --> 51:59.147
look, I know. Liz, please!

51:59.241 --> 52:00.777
I still don't actually
understand

52:00.868 --> 52:02.278
why we are going
to the Winchester.

52:02.369 --> 52:04.610
Because it's a pub,
it's safe, it's secure.

52:04.705 --> 52:06.616
They know us there.
What makes it so secure?

52:06.707 --> 52:09.587
Because it's got big heavy doors and
deadbolts. You've been to a lock in.

52:09.668 --> 52:11.187
Several. And there's a
rifle above the bar.

52:11.211 --> 52:13.543
I would think that's deactivated.
Surely.

52:13.631 --> 52:16.418
It's not. I'm telling you. John's
connected. Big al says so.

52:16.508 --> 52:18.419
Yeah, well, big al also says
dogs can't look up!

52:18.510 --> 52:19.625
They can't. Can't they?

52:19.720 --> 52:21.176
No, they can't!
Of course they can!

52:21.221 --> 52:23.963
Are you sure? I... yes, look, the
pub is the right place to go.

52:24.058 --> 52:25.923
Okay? Everything
is gonna be fine, I promise.

52:26.018 --> 52:27.883
Shaun?
I turned it off, all right?

52:27.978 --> 52:30.640
It's not easy. What?

52:30.731 --> 52:33.313
Being a father, it's not easy.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.435
What?

52:34.526 --> 52:36.938
You were 12 when I met you.

52:37.029 --> 52:39.361
You'd already grown up so much.

52:39.448 --> 52:41.404
I just wanted you to be strong

52:41.492 --> 52:45.076
and not give up
because you lost your dad.

52:45.746 --> 52:47.327
Philip, you don't
have to explain.

52:47.414 --> 52:51.657
No, I do.
I always loved you, Shaun.

52:51.752 --> 52:57.497
I always thought you had
it in you to do well.

52:57.591 --> 53:00.583
And you just need motivation.

53:00.678 --> 53:04.262
Somebody to look up to, and...

53:06.100 --> 53:08.136
I thought it could be me.

53:10.104 --> 53:13.722
Would you just take care
of your mum?

53:16.485 --> 53:18.350
There's a good boy.

53:21.949 --> 53:23.530
Ed, can you pull over?

53:27.538 --> 53:29.494
Ed, please pull over. What for?

53:29.581 --> 53:31.788
Ed, just pull over! All right.

53:38.465 --> 53:39.545
Whoa, mama!

53:39.633 --> 53:41.111
Christ! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

53:41.135 --> 53:42.716
Chill out. Everyone's all right.

53:42.803 --> 53:45.636
Stop telling me to chill out!

53:46.765 --> 53:48.993
And no, for your information,
everybody is not all right.

53:49.017 --> 53:50.723
Barbara: What's wrong?

53:50.811 --> 53:52.597
Mum, it's Philip, he's gone.

53:52.688 --> 53:54.303
Where's he gone?

53:54.398 --> 53:56.059
Mum, he's dead.

53:56.150 --> 53:57.560
No, he isn't.

53:59.069 --> 54:01.560
Get out! Get out!

54:01.905 --> 54:04.897
Oh, Jesus! Fuck, fuck.

54:04.992 --> 54:06.482
It won't open! It won't open!

54:06.577 --> 54:07.817
Ed, get the child locks!

54:07.911 --> 54:10.027
Dianne: Come on, quick, come on.

54:10.164 --> 54:12.844
Sere eases se seas ees cras lae tie

54:34.021 --> 54:35.886
Now what?
We've got to keep moving.

54:36.023 --> 54:37.625
How do we get Philip out the car?
Shaun: We haven't got time.

54:37.649 --> 54:38.710
Liz: What about
the blunt objects?

54:38.734 --> 54:39.734
Do you want to get them?

54:39.818 --> 54:41.898
Shaun, we can't just leave your dad!
He's not my dad!

54:41.987 --> 54:44.524
Oh, Shaun... mum, he was,
but he's not anymore!

54:44.615 --> 54:46.676
I really think we could... no,
listen to me, mum, listen.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.565
That's not even
your husband in there.

54:48.660 --> 54:49.900
Okay? I know it looks like him,

54:49.953 --> 54:53.286
but there is nothing of the man you
loved in that car now, nothing!

54:56.043 --> 54:57.533
Let's go, shall we?

54:58.337 --> 55:00.703
You're not seriously
suggesting we walk!

55:02.841 --> 55:04.001
Everybody okay back there?

55:04.092 --> 55:06.879
Oh, yeah, we're having
a whale of a time.

55:06.970 --> 55:09.928
Maybe we should all hold
hands, like a crocodile?

55:10.015 --> 55:12.176
Do you have any idea
where we're actually going?

55:12.267 --> 55:13.882
David, come on. Sorry.

55:14.895 --> 55:16.977
Do you, though?
Yeah, totally, totally.

55:17.064 --> 55:18.725
Well, are we close?

55:24.905 --> 55:26.566
We're pretty close.

55:27.616 --> 55:28.901
Is your mum gonna be okay?

55:28.992 --> 55:29.992
Yeah, I hope so.

55:30.077 --> 55:31.513
Did you manage to get in
contact with your folks?

55:31.537 --> 55:33.723
They're in Antigua. Do you
think this is happening there?

55:33.747 --> 55:35.533
I hope not.

55:35.624 --> 55:38.832
Listen, Liz, about last night. You know,
I know loads of things were said, but...

55:38.919 --> 55:40.679
Shaun, you said
this wasn't about you and me.

55:40.754 --> 55:41.815
No, no, it's not, but, I just...

55:41.839 --> 55:43.329
You said it was about survival.

55:43.423 --> 55:44.567
Yeah, it is,
but what I'm saying is...

55:44.591 --> 55:46.319
You're not doing all this just
to prove something, are you?

55:46.343 --> 55:47.403
No, of course not.
I just think...

55:47.427 --> 55:49.947
Because I meant everything I said
last night. Nothing's changed.

55:52.683 --> 55:54.369
Maybe this isn't the best time
to talk about it.

55:54.393 --> 55:56.304
Okay... oh, my god!

55:57.271 --> 55:58.511
Shaun.

55:59.398 --> 56:01.605
Yvonne. How's it going?

56:02.651 --> 56:04.391
Surviving. Hey, Liz.

56:04.486 --> 56:05.976
Long time no see.

56:06.071 --> 56:07.106
Hey, Yvonne.

56:08.740 --> 56:10.856
This is my boyfriend, Declan.

56:10.951 --> 56:16.196
My friends Mark, Maggie,
my mum and my cousin Tom.

56:16.290 --> 56:18.576
This is Shaun
and his girlfriend Liz.

56:18.667 --> 56:19.873
They've split up, actually.

56:19.960 --> 56:21.370
Oh, really?

56:21.461 --> 56:22.576
Yeah.

56:22.671 --> 56:23.877
That's a shame.

56:23.964 --> 56:25.704
Well, we should scoot.

56:25.799 --> 56:26.860
Have you got
somewhere you're going?

56:26.884 --> 56:29.091
Yeah, we're going
to the Winchester.

56:29.177 --> 56:30.462
The pub?

56:32.598 --> 56:35.385
Yeah. Right, well. Good luck!

56:41.440 --> 56:42.896
Hil hi!

56:42.983 --> 56:44.223
Hello. Hello.

56:44.318 --> 56:45.558
Hi. Hi.

56:45.652 --> 56:47.358
Hello. Hello.

56:47.446 --> 56:48.446
All right. All right.

56:50.866 --> 56:53.073
See, what did I say? The
Winchester's just over there.

56:53.160 --> 56:55.526
Over where? Over there.

56:55.621 --> 56:58.203
Just over there,
over the 20 garden fences?

56:58.916 --> 57:03.455
What's the matter, David,
never taken a shortcut before?

57:21.021 --> 57:25.765
Shaun, I'm sure Jill and Derek
live round here.

57:39.498 --> 57:43.161
Now, the Winchester is just
over that fence, all right?

57:43.251 --> 57:45.663
So, everyone stay
where they are. I'll...

57:45.754 --> 57:46.869
Hang on, are we all here?

57:46.964 --> 57:48.795
One, two, three,
four, five. Yes.

57:48.882 --> 57:50.622
There's six of us. Oh.

57:52.052 --> 57:53.462
Mum!

57:55.722 --> 57:57.713
I'm coming!

57:57.808 --> 58:00.766
Mum, mum! Mum, are you okay?
Are you okay?

58:00.852 --> 58:03.685
I don't think Jill and Derek
do live here.

58:06.066 --> 58:07.181
Shaun?

58:10.988 --> 58:12.728
Are you all right?

58:30.924 --> 58:32.539
What are you doing?

58:35.137 --> 58:36.547
Dianne: Shaun!

58:40.183 --> 58:41.514
Yes!

58:44.104 --> 58:45.765
No, that's rubbish.

58:53.363 --> 58:55.103
Yes!

58:57.617 --> 58:59.858
Feel free to step in any time!

58:59.953 --> 59:00.988
You did all right.

59:01.079 --> 59:02.489
I didn't want
to cramp your style.

59:02.581 --> 59:04.867
Why? I'm so sorry about that.

59:07.085 --> 59:08.450
Right.

59:10.672 --> 59:12.287
Okay, everyone just stay
where they are.

59:12.382 --> 59:14.623
I'm gonna check
if the coast is clear.

59:24.019 --> 59:26.135
Is it clear? No.

59:26.229 --> 59:27.969
Liz: How many? Lots.

59:38.533 --> 59:41.570
Oh, well, that is just great.

59:41.661 --> 59:43.526
There are a fair
few of them, yes.

59:43.622 --> 59:46.785
I trust Shaun has another
genius scheme up his sleeve?

59:46.875 --> 59:49.241
This is hardly
constructive, David!

59:49.336 --> 59:51.076
No, Lizzie,
this is a waste of time.

59:51.213 --> 59:52.482
Aes El a a seta ease te sr es a ee te te

59:52.506 --> 59:53.837
yeah, why didn't you? Because...

59:53.924 --> 59:57.667
Because... because,
because of captain wow!

59:57.761 --> 59:58.761
Will you stop it!

59:58.845 --> 01:00:00.927
Yes, we're not gonna get
anywhere by moaning.

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:14.935
Right, let's all shake out.
Get nice and limber. Or not.

01:00:15.028 --> 01:00:18.771
Now, take another look at the way he moves.
Remember, very limp.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.446
Almost like sleepwalking.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:24.652
Look at the face, it's vacant
with a hint of sadness.

01:00:24.746 --> 01:00:26.862
Like a drunk who's lost a bet.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:29.198
Okay, let's try, shall we? Liz.

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:37.122
Nice, good vocal work. Okay.
Barbara, that's excellent.

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:39.875
Sorry, dear, I was miles away.

01:00:40.387 --> 01:00:41.387
Daffs.

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:43.514
Come on!

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:46.639
Okay. It's mournful, sorrowful,

01:00:46.726 --> 01:00:48.762
you're dead,
and you hate it. Go.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.561
Much better. Ed.

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:54.230
I'll do it on the night.
This is the night!

01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:57.650
What is that? What about yours?

01:00:57.737 --> 01:01:00.649
Who died and made you
fucking king of the zombies?

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.071
Don't.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:08.657
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Okay, right.

01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.329
Let's all try together,
shall we?

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:13.079
One, two, three.

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:10.011
Go, go, go, go.

01:02:11.394 --> 01:02:14.181
Shit. Get round me,
get round me.

01:02:14.272 --> 01:02:16.308
John? John, Bernie,
are you there?

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:19.015
It's Shaun and ed.
We come in all the time.

01:02:19.110 --> 01:02:21.522
They can hear you.
We do the quiz.

01:02:21.613 --> 01:02:23.228
They know.
Stay in character, daffs!

01:02:23.323 --> 01:02:24.529
I can't see them.

01:02:24.616 --> 01:02:26.356
Shaun, we have to get inside.

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:28.638
Break the window. Don't be stupid,
we'll be totally exposed!

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:30.277
We are totally exposed.
Break the window!

01:02:30.372 --> 01:02:31.452
Is there another way in?

01:02:31.539 --> 01:02:32.619
Well, yeah, there's...

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:36.992
Two seconds.

01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:38.793
Hey, noodle.
You all right, mate?

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:41.025
Yeah, man, I can't really talk now.
Did you get anything yet?

01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:42.414
I got nothing. Really?

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:43.819
No, I'm right
in the middle of something.

01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:44.923
A bit mentalist, isn't it?

01:02:45.011 --> 01:02:48.094
Yeah, it's weird, isn't it?
Oil what are you doing?

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.513
What am I doing? What are you
doing, you stupid moron?

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:52.761
Fuck off. You fuck off!

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:54.808
Fuck fucking off!

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:57.224
Liz: Shaun... I've spent an entire life...
Look at me.

01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:59.522
I've spent my entire life
sticking my neck out for you,

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.315
and all you ever do
is fuck things up!

01:03:01.403 --> 01:03:03.109
Fuck things up
and make me look stupid!

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.938
Well, I'm not gonna let you
do it anymore. Not today.

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:07.272
Shaun...

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:09.903
On.

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:20.126
You were saying
about another way in?

01:03:20.213 --> 01:03:21.623
Yeah, there's a...

01:03:22.716 --> 01:03:24.502
What are you doing?

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:26.462
No!

01:03:28.054 --> 01:03:29.965
Get inside!
No, they'll follow us!

01:03:30.056 --> 01:03:31.136
What? They'll follow us.

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:32.743
Just keep up the act, I'm
gonna have to do something.

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:34.257
What do you mean,
"do something"?

01:03:34.352 --> 01:03:36.468
Hello, hello,
over here, over here!

01:03:36.563 --> 01:03:41.057
Come on, come on, that's it, yeah, come
on, come on, that's it, over here!

01:03:41.151 --> 01:03:43.517
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, over here!
Yeah, come on!

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:46.148
Oh, bollocks. Okay, wait till
I've gone, then get inside!

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:47.239
Gone where? Gone where?

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:48.689
I won't be long, I promise.

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:51.820
Come on, you
pasty-faced fuckers, let's go!

01:03:51.911 --> 01:03:53.902
Follow me. Come on, let's go!

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:56.655
Come on, this way,
this way, that's it, come on!

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.661
Come on. This way, follow me.

01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:00.959
Come on, follow me. Come on!

01:04:01.046 --> 01:04:04.209
Come and get it!
It's a running buffet!

01:04:04.299 --> 01:04:06.335
All you can eat!

01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:08.458
Shall we go in, then?

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.767
Come on, Barbara. Leave those.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:20.311
I think they're for me.

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:42.117
He's been gone
a good 20 minutes.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:43.212
Seventeen.

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:46.754
Either way, we need to think about
blocking up this window here.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:48.377
We're totally exposed.

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:50.459
How will Shaun get back in?

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.134
I'm sure he'll knock.

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:56.214
Oh, for goodness sake,
let's get some lights on here.

01:04:56.309 --> 01:04:57.674
David, wait!

01:04:58.478 --> 01:05:00.719
Power's off.
That's a good thing.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:03.334
We don't want to advertise our
whereabouts more than we already have.

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:04.393
No, of course not.

01:05:04.484 --> 01:05:05.974
Do we, David?

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:10.441
No, of course not, Lizzie.
I'm just being proactive.

01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:13.219
There's no lights, there's no power.
Where are the owners?

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:15.199
And there's that bloody
great hole in the window.

01:05:15.286 --> 01:05:16.446
You did that, you twat!

01:05:16.538 --> 01:05:17.698
Somebody had to do something!

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.225
I don't know
if you noticed back there,

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:20.614
but we were in a spot of bother.

01:05:20.708 --> 01:05:22.353
Somebody has to take control
of the situation,

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:26.996
and if none of you are prepared
to accept that responsibility

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:30.082
then perhaps I should.

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.424
Will Shaun be gone long?

01:05:32.512 --> 01:05:34.798
Liz: He'll be back soon.
How can you know that?

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:36.550
I don't think
he'd leave us, daffs.

01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.508
Wouldn't he? Lizzie, how can
you put your faith in a man

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:42.844
you spectacularly binned
for being unreliable?

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.804
A man whose idea
of a romantic nightspot

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:46.981
and an impenetrable fortress
are the same thing.

01:05:47.068 --> 01:05:50.856
This is a pub! We are in a pub!
What are we going to do?

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:52.695
I could get a round in.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:55.615
Look, let's just keep quiet
and wait for Shaun.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:57.533
We can barricade the window
when he gets back.

01:05:57.620 --> 01:06:00.407
What then? How long?
Days? Weeks? A month?

01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:02.017
What about food?
What are we going to eat?

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.077
Toasties! Yeah, there's
a breville out back.

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.000
Oh, great, then!
Saved by nibbles!

01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:08.703
That must be why Shaun took us
here before he buggered off.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:10.334
He's coming back!

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:12.962
Why? Because he promised?

01:06:13.052 --> 01:06:15.692
And even if he does, do you think
his master plan's going to extend

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:18.429
to anything more than sitting
and eating peanuts in the dark?

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:19.847
What, is he just gonna stroll in

01:06:19.934 --> 01:06:21.245
and suddenly everything's
gonna be okay?

01:06:21.269 --> 01:06:23.885
I don't know, David!

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:25.933
I don't know any more
than you do.

01:06:26.024 --> 01:06:27.889
But what I do know is
that we're here now

01:06:27.984 --> 01:06:30.851
and we have to make
the best of it!

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:34.020
Ed, get me a double vodka.

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:35.321
Right you are.

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:37.148
Think I'll have
a drink, too, actually.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:39.154
Would you like a drink, Barbara?
Hello.

01:06:39.245 --> 01:06:41.515
Right, great, fuck it. That's what
we'll do, that's what we'll do.

01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:42.725
We'll all have a party.
How about that?

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:44.159
We all get completely smashed.

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.536
Oh, look, we've got our nibbles.

01:06:46.628 --> 01:06:48.164
We've got our mini cheddars...

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:49.835
David! We got twiglets.

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:52.084
Oh, look, hog lumps.

01:06:57.263 --> 01:06:58.799
Pickle.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:00.755
Hello, mum. You all right?

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:02.511
Everybody okay? Yeah.

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:04.371
Any sign of John and Bernie?
We haven't seen them.

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.135
Check upstairs?
I think it's locked.

01:07:06.231 --> 01:07:07.249
What's the phone situation?

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:09.639
Dead. Same as the power.

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:11.690
Okay.

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.689
Nice of you to join us.

01:07:14.072 --> 01:07:16.859
Yeah, well,
I promised, didn't I?

01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.787
How did you lose them?

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:30.331
I just gave them the slip. Wasn't
difficult. They're not all that.

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.166
Well, how did you get in?

01:07:32.257 --> 01:07:33.872
There is a back door, David.

01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:36.111
I tried to tell you before you
went and smashed the window.

01:07:36.135 --> 01:07:37.696
Well, I wasn't the one
who was blowing our cover

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.551
by having a tiff
with my boyfriend.

01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:41.220
He's not my boyfriend.

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.555
Might be a bit warm,
the cooler's off.

01:07:43.643 --> 01:07:44.974
Thanks, babe.

01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.762
So, what's the plan, then?

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:54.271
Would anyone like a peanut?

01:08:03.663 --> 01:08:05.779
Why don't you do your Clyde?

01:08:05.873 --> 01:08:08.615
Oh, come... has anyone seen
every which way but loose?

01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:11.372
Ed does the most amazing
impression of the orangutan.

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:14.249
No, it's not.
It is. Come on. Do it.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:16.376
No, no. But it's brilliant.
Come on, just do it.

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:17.653
Do it, it'll work.
Come on, just do it.

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:19.154
You've built it up too much,
I feel uncomfortable.

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:21.294
No, you don't. Just do it.
Oh, come on, do it.

01:08:21.389 --> 01:08:23.242
See. Everyone wants to see it.
We could do with a laugh.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:25.848
Do it, do it, do it, do it.
Come on, do it.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:28.051
I'm not a performing monkey.

01:08:30.982 --> 01:08:33.689
The power's on. It's
not, I tried it earlier.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:36.005
No, but the streetlights have come on.
It means the grid isn't out.

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:38.215
It's the fuses. I'll just flip them
back on, we can watch television.

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:39.319
Liz: What about the lights?

01:08:39.365 --> 01:08:42.323
Yes, we don't want to advertise our
whereabouts more than we already have.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.010
The lights operate
on a separate circuit,

01:08:44.037 --> 01:08:45.573
I'll just flip
the mains breakers.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:47.654
It's quite simple, David.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:18.604
Is that it? Liz: That's it!

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:48.924
Liz, have you got a quid?

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:55.096
Yeah.

01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:02.229
Never anything on, is there?

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:07.616
What?

01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:13.035
I think we might have
a bit of a problem.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:15.158
What do you mean?

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:19.746
They followed me.

01:10:20.425 --> 01:10:22.757
I thought you said
you gave them the slip.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:29.388
Well, we'll just have to be
extra quiet, then, won't we?

01:10:31.144 --> 01:10:32.384
What?

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:36.478
Ed, no! Ed, no!

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:38.852
Turn it off!

01:11:11.142 --> 01:11:12.473
Shit!

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:15.111
Where the hell did he come from?
I don't know.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:21.311
Who the hell put this on?
It's on random.

01:11:21.402 --> 01:11:22.437
For fuck's sake!

01:11:22.528 --> 01:11:25.941
Okay, dianne, get mum somewhere safe.
David, kill the queen.

01:11:26.032 --> 01:11:27.238
What? The jukebox!

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:28.861
Liz, ed, grab something weapony.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.907
Ed: What about the rifle?
It's not real!

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.280
Cocktails? What do you mean?

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:36.114
The flaming spirits. Drambuie, Sambuca,
Brandy. Get a rag in. Light it.

01:11:36.250 --> 01:11:38.741
But the whole place could go up.
What, then?

01:11:39.045 --> 01:11:40.626
How about pool?

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:49.423
Okay, John,
it's time at the bar!

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:09.990
I can't find the switches!

01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:12.366
Well, then get the fuses!

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:47.735
Why is queen still on?

01:12:47.822 --> 01:12:49.107
We have a situation!

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.278
I know!

01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:52.527
Fuck this. Ed!

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.154
Two seconds.

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:55.280
Oil

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:04.793
Shaun!

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:09.002
No!

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.302
Yes! Yes! In the head!

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.763
Shauny!

01:13:35.620 --> 01:13:38.111
Why didn't you
just shoot him, man?

01:13:39.624 --> 01:13:41.535
Ed, for the last time, it's...

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.960
I fucking knew it!

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:49.539
What did I tell you?
Big al was right.

01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:50.714
Okay,

01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:57.095
but dogs can look up.

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:02.927
Okay, has anyone fired a gun before?
Oh, yeah.

01:14:05.024 --> 01:14:06.139
Apart from David and ed?

01:14:06.233 --> 01:14:07.723
Sorry, what was Ed's experience?

01:14:10.071 --> 01:14:11.106
I think you should do it.

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:12.215
I think we should all do it.

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:13.729
How can five people
operate one gun?

01:14:13.824 --> 01:14:16.941
None of us have any real experience, okay?
Now, we've only got...

01:14:17.036 --> 01:14:18.617
Twenty-nine.
Twenty-nine bullets.

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:20.464
Call them "shells."
We've only got 29 shells,

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:21.975
we really need to work
together on this.

01:14:21.999 --> 01:14:23.226
I need someone
to help me reload,

01:14:23.250 --> 01:14:25.115
everyone else to look out.
I will fire.

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:26.496
As bertrand Russell once said,

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:29.795
"the only thing that will
redeem mankind is cooperation.”

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:33.045
I think we can all appreciate
the relevance of that now.

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:34.495
Was that on the back
of a beer mat?

01:14:34.553 --> 01:14:35.918
Yeah, it was
guinness extra cold.

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:41.966
They definitely want to come in.

01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:43.176
Get mum out of the way.

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:46.646
David, dianne, let's go.
Ed, give me some shells.

01:14:48.776 --> 01:14:51.142
Barbara? Oh, hello.

01:14:51.278 --> 01:14:54.190
Would you like to come with me?
That would be lovely.

01:14:56.075 --> 01:14:58.361
It's nice to meet you, finally.

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:01.198
Shaun's always
talking about you.

01:15:01.288 --> 01:15:02.653
Really? Yeah.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:05.122
Barbara?

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:08.625
Are you all right?

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:11.204
I've got something for you.

01:15:12.591 --> 01:15:16.049
Shaun's father gave me this.
Shaun's real father, I mean.

01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:18.002
I'd like you to have it.

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:19.678
Barbara, Shaun and I have...

01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:21.380
It seems only right.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:39.694
I didn't want to say anything.

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:41.821
I thought Shaun
would be worried.

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:46.239
Liz? David: Here they come!

01:15:48.127 --> 01:15:50.243
Stay behind me! Stay behind me!
There's one!

01:15:50.337 --> 01:15:51.372
Sorry, we're closed!

01:15:53.632 --> 01:15:55.444
Try the safety button. Yeah,
that happened to me on stage.

01:15:55.468 --> 01:15:56.708
Cock it!

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.391
Over there! Over where?

01:16:06.479 --> 01:16:07.810
3:00.

01:16:14.028 --> 01:16:15.984
Over there again.
Quarter to twelve.

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:17.482
What?

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.734
11:45. Keep it simple!

01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:22.358
Top left.

01:16:24.663 --> 01:16:26.403
Reload. I'm on it!

01:16:32.755 --> 01:16:34.245
Nice shot.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:37.047
Okay, David, dianne,
let's block up this window!

01:16:37.134 --> 01:16:38.874
Ed, take over a sec.

01:16:40.221 --> 01:16:43.213
Shaun: What is it? What's wrong?
Liz: Shaun, I'm so sorry.

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:44.307
Mum, what's wrong?

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:51.720
Mum, I don't understand.

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:53.772
The man in his pajamas...

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:56.566
I didn't want to say anything,
I thought you'd be upset.

01:16:56.654 --> 01:16:58.645
No, you should've said.

01:17:00.241 --> 01:17:02.232
Take over a sec. What?

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:04.692
What's going on?
What's up? What's wrong?

01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:06.743
What the hell's going on?
Barbara's hurt!

01:17:06.831 --> 01:17:08.947
Mum. Just take over a minute.

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:12.204
Jesus. Dianne: I know first aid.

01:17:13.379 --> 01:17:17.588
Just hang on. Mum?
Mum? Is she...

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:18.915
Shaun...

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:21.375
Just hold on, mum,
you're gonna be fine.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:24.052
I never thanked you. For what?

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:29.304
For these. "To a wonderful mum."

01:17:31.438 --> 01:17:34.225
It's been a funny
sort of day, hasn't it?

01:17:35.359 --> 01:17:40.444
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, mum,
come on, mum stop it, stop it, stop it.

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:44.149
Don't, mum. Please don't go.

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:56.125
What are you doing?

01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:57.328
We have to deal with her.

01:17:57.423 --> 01:17:58.503
Daffs!

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.081
For Christ's sake!

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:02.417
She's gonna come back!
She's not gone anywhere.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:03.921
Well, she'll change.

01:18:04.013 --> 01:18:05.674
She's my mum.

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:08.631
She's a zombie. Don't say that!

01:18:08.726 --> 01:18:11.684
Move aside.
I'm gonna count to three.

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:15.262
One, two, three!

01:18:15.983 --> 01:18:17.723
Don't point that gun at my mum!

01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:19.524
Shaun, calm down!

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:21.193
Don't point that gun at Barbara!

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:23.271
Ed, don't exacerbate things!
What does that mean?

01:18:23.365 --> 01:18:25.481
This isn't exactly fair!

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:26.907
Here. Thank you.

01:18:26.994 --> 01:18:28.484
Ed: It's okay.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:32.162
Please, can we just stop
and think about this?

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:34.365
Tell him to put the gun down!

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.701
Look, Lizzie, she's gonna change.
You know I'm right.

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:39.912
And when she does, she'll come
back and she'll kill all of us.

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.747
That's what your ex
can't seem to realize.

01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:43.548
That's what this
is about, isn't it?

01:18:43.636 --> 01:18:45.467
It's just... he just...
He doesn't like Mel

01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:47.761
he's always hated me and now
he wants to shoot my mum!

01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:48.848
She's not...

01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:51.345
You've never thought I deserved
her, that I was good enough.

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:52.454
What are you talking about?

01:18:52.478 --> 01:18:55.185
Oh, come on, we all know
you're in love with Liz!

01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:56.352
That is not true!

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.271
Yes, it is! That is not true.

01:18:58.359 --> 01:19:00.315
Dianne: Yes, it is. What?

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:03.894
I know you only hung out with me
at college to get close to Liz.

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:05.195
And when she knocked you back,

01:19:05.282 --> 01:19:06.897
I was there
to pick up the pieces.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:10.359
I've come to terms with
that, daffs, why can't you?

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:13.449
Lizzie, I want you to know
that my feelings for you

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:14.601
have always been essentially...

01:19:14.625 --> 01:19:18.083
David, please! There are slightly
more pressing matters at hand here!

01:19:18.170 --> 01:19:20.752
Like the fact that "daffs"
is pointing a gun at my mum!

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:24.915
For Christ's sake,
she's not dead!

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:28.002
She's finished! For a hero,
you're quite a hypocrite!

01:19:28.097 --> 01:19:29.199
You're the one
that's gone from being

01:19:29.223 --> 01:19:31.134
a chartered accountant
to charlton heston!

01:19:31.225 --> 01:19:33.011
I'm not a chartered accountant!

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:34.387
Well, you look like one!

01:19:34.478 --> 01:19:36.343
Yeah! I'm a lecturer!

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:38.303
You're a twat! Yeah!

01:19:38.399 --> 01:19:42.062
She's not your mum anymore! In a
minute she'll be just another zombie!

01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:44.859
Don't say that.
We're not using the z word.

01:19:44.947 --> 01:19:49.862
Please, can we just
calm the fuck down?

01:19:51.161 --> 01:19:54.870
Now, I can see
what David is trying to say...

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:57.198
Thank you, Lizzie.
Even if he is being a twat!

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:58.328
Yep.

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:02.461
And, Shaun, Shaun, look at me.

01:20:04.591 --> 01:20:08.300
I can't begin to imagine
how hard this must be for you,

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:10.844
but we can't afford
to fall apart.

01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:16.471
Shaun, babe, I know
you don't wanna hear this.

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:37.329
You do it.

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:49.629
I'm sorry, mum.

01:20:51.638 --> 01:20:52.798
Do it!

01:21:08.947 --> 01:21:12.030
Well, I think we're all agreed,

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:13.982
you did the right thing there.

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:20.989
David, no!

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.539
David.

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:26.712
Right, I'm leaving.

01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:28.539
What? I'm not staying here.

01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:30.716
David, don't, it's suicide.

01:21:30.803 --> 01:21:31.963
I think you should go.

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:33.814
We will. We can run,
we can defend ourselves.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:35.629
What do you mean "we?"

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:36.868
What do you mean,
"what do I mean 'we"?

01:21:36.892 --> 01:21:40.555
Opening that door now would be a
very, very silly thing to do.

01:21:40.646 --> 01:21:42.102
So, are you gonna stay
here with him?

01:21:42.147 --> 01:21:43.875
Look, Shaun... after everything
he's gotten us into!

01:21:43.899 --> 01:21:45.639
You let me finish!

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:47.474
Shaun didn't ask you
to come here.

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:49.150
You came for the same
reason that I did,

01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:50.507
'cause you didn't know
what else to do.

01:21:50.531 --> 01:21:52.067
Get away from that door
this instant!

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:53.772
But... David!

01:22:02.835 --> 01:22:04.325
I'm so sorry, dianne.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.663
Maybe I'm not the one
you should be apologizing to.

01:22:10.509 --> 01:22:11.715
Shaun...

01:22:17.558 --> 01:22:20.049
David! No!

01:22:20.144 --> 01:22:23.011
No, no, no, no!

01:22:23.897 --> 01:22:25.307
David!

01:22:26.150 --> 01:22:27.265
No, no!

01:22:27.359 --> 01:22:28.849
David!

01:22:49.339 --> 01:22:50.829
David!

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:53.957
Dianne, no! Dianne, no!

01:22:54.052 --> 01:22:55.462
I'm coming, David!

01:22:56.013 --> 01:22:58.299
David! David!

01:23:01.894 --> 01:23:03.179
Oh, dear.

01:23:03.645 --> 01:23:05.351
Cocktails? Do it.

01:23:16.450 --> 01:23:17.860
Stay back!

01:23:23.665 --> 01:23:25.280
Shaun, hold them!

01:23:28.795 --> 01:23:29.875
Heads!

01:23:34.343 --> 01:23:36.254
Ed! Hurry up!

01:23:37.846 --> 01:23:39.757
Shauny, look who it is.

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:42.051
Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

01:23:44.603 --> 01:23:45.843
Ed!

01:23:46.355 --> 01:23:48.095
Shaun! Ed!

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:50.272
Don't groan at me,
you thick fuck!

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:52.099
I can't hold them!

01:23:55.656 --> 01:23:56.896
No!

01:24:00.869 --> 01:24:02.825
Shaun! Petel

01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:07.368
I said, leave him alone!

01:24:10.462 --> 01:24:13.704
Ed! Ed!

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:15.960
Shaun, bar!

01:24:27.729 --> 01:24:28.969
Ed!

01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:31.475
Ed!

01:24:33.068 --> 01:24:34.228
Ed!

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.355
What?

01:24:37.573 --> 01:24:39.609
Chuck us a cloth will you?

01:24:52.379 --> 01:24:54.745
Where are the shells?
They're on the bar.

01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:56.171
Oh, fuck!

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:01.168
Fuck it!

01:25:02.723 --> 01:25:04.714
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

01:25:04.808 --> 01:25:06.924
The cellar!
Maybe we can get out.

01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:09.101
There's a barrel hatch
that leads into the street.

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:10.927
You mean go back outside?

01:25:12.691 --> 01:25:15.023
Oh, give us a fucking break!

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:22.439
Go! Gol

01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:35.039
I can see the street.

01:25:36.673 --> 01:25:37.879
Come on.

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:40.757
Come on!

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:44.344
Why won't it open?

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:56.982
That's it, isn't it?
We're trapped.

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:58.980
"Hey, let's go
to the Winchester!"

01:25:59.071 --> 01:26:01.232
Whose fucking idea was that?

01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:03.564
Man, I've really
ballsed this up.

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:10.825
No, you haven't. I have, Liz.
I couldn't save us.

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:15.910
I couldn't save di or David. I couldn't
even save my mum. I'm useless.

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:19.292
You shouldn't feel
so responsible, you tried.

01:26:19.383 --> 01:26:21.749
You did something,
that's what counts.

01:26:23.428 --> 01:26:25.043
Yeah, I suppose.

01:26:28.517 --> 01:26:30.348
Do you think
they'll get through?

01:26:30.977 --> 01:26:32.467
Yeah.

01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:36.313
How many shells
have we got left?

01:26:38.944 --> 01:26:43.608
Two. I suppose we could take a few
of them out if they stand in a line.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:46.861
I wasn't thinking about them.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:48.738
I know.

01:26:53.875 --> 01:26:55.581
What about ed?
There's only two shells.

01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:57.660
I don't mind being eaten.

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:04.834
How are we gonna do this?

01:27:05.262 --> 01:27:06.752
I don't know.

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:09.463
One of us has to go first.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:12.891
Maybe one should do the other
and then do themselves.

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:16.641
Maybe you should do me. I'll only
muck it up if I have to do myself.

01:27:25.490 --> 01:27:27.135
Do you know, I don't think
I've got it in me

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:30.993
to shoot my flatmate, my mum and my
girlfriend all in the same evening.

01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:36.156
What makes you think
I've taken you back?

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:40.911
You don't want to die
single, do you?

01:27:41.006 --> 01:27:44.669
Ed: Actually, I would like
to be shot.

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:50.012
Besides, I've changed. I haven't had
a fag since yesterday, I promise.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:51.429
He hasn't.

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:56.476
Maybe we should have one now.

01:27:58.231 --> 01:27:59.846
What...

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.272
You left them in my flat.

01:28:01.359 --> 01:28:02.815
Yeah, in the bin.

01:28:02.903 --> 01:28:04.643
I was desperate.

01:28:04.738 --> 01:28:06.228
Sneaky monkey.

01:28:06.323 --> 01:28:07.779
Sorry.

01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:09.652
I won't say anything.

01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:24.625
Come on,
we're getting out of here.

01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:26.957
I might just stay here.

01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:28.792
Yeah, but we can get out.

01:28:28.887 --> 01:28:30.593
I think you two
should make a go of it.

01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.261
What are you talking about?

01:28:32.349 --> 01:28:34.305
I only hold you back.

01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:35.723
Yeah, but...

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:43.148
Maybe you should have this.

01:28:43.944 --> 01:28:45.775
Don't you want it?

01:28:45.862 --> 01:28:48.899
No. I can't hit anything
with it anyway, I'm rubbish.

01:28:52.452 --> 01:28:53.942
Ed, I'm sorry.

01:28:54.704 --> 01:28:55.989
What for?

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:59.747
'Cause I was shouting
at you earlier on.

01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:02.747
It's all right. I'm sorry, too.

01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:05.295
It's okay.

01:29:05.382 --> 01:29:08.374
No, I'm sorry, Shaun.

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:15.593
Oh, god, god. That's not funny.

01:29:15.684 --> 01:29:17.845
I'll stop doing them
when you stop laughing.

01:29:17.936 --> 01:29:19.551
I'm not laughing.

01:29:33.326 --> 01:29:34.782
You better be off.

01:29:44.296 --> 01:29:46.708
Bye, ed. Love you.

01:29:47.966 --> 01:29:49.001
Cheers.

01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:52.296
I love you, too, man.

01:29:55.807 --> 01:29:57.468
Gay!

01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:19.494
Ready?

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:21.829
Ready.

01:30:30.634 --> 01:30:35.344
Soldier: Section one. Ready.
Zombies to your front. Fire!

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:39.889
Section one.
Targets to your front. Fire!

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.033
Oh, my god. Shaun!

01:30:58.119 --> 01:30:59.199
Yvonne?

01:31:04.668 --> 01:31:05.953
How you doing?

01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:07.951
Surviving. Surviving.

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:09.148
They're taking us
somewhere safe.

01:31:09.172 --> 01:31:10.274
I thought you two might wanna...

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:11.538
Soldier: Move it! ...Tag along.

01:31:12.717 --> 01:31:14.753
Is it just the two of you?

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:20.217
Well, glad somebody made it.

01:31:22.185 --> 01:31:23.391
Come on.

01:31:37.993 --> 01:31:40.985
Man on TV: Next, we'll hear the story
of 10-year-old Enrique romerez

01:31:41.079 --> 01:31:44.321
who fought off the reanimated
corpses of his entire family.

01:31:44.666 --> 01:31:48.079
It's all coming right up
on zombies from hell.

01:31:48.253 --> 01:31:49.959
Male reporter: Six months on
and to many

01:31:50.046 --> 01:31:53.083
the events of z-day
must seem like a bad dream.

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:57.133
And as we now know, the phenomenon
resulted from the use of highly...

01:31:57.220 --> 01:31:58.585
Hot something I ever expected

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:01.137
as a newscaster
to have to say on air.

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:05.217
"Removing the head or destroying
the brain." Incredible.

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:08.845
Dead excited now, to have a top band
with us, talking about their work,

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:10.680
for the charity zombaid.

01:32:10.775 --> 01:32:12.628
Female reporter: The fact
that the mobile deceased

01:32:12.652 --> 01:32:14.563
retained their primal instincts

01:32:14.654 --> 01:32:17.737
make them ideal recruitment
for the service industry.

01:32:17.824 --> 01:32:21.191
As well as proving themselves
useful in other roles, such as...

01:32:21.286 --> 01:32:25.450
Man: He can't quite get it.
He's fallen, he's down!

01:32:27.584 --> 01:32:28.994
I don't see
nothing wrong with it,

01:32:29.085 --> 01:32:31.542
but I know that some people would
see something wrong with it.

01:32:31.629 --> 01:32:33.585
But he's my husband, you know.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.923
I still love him, and I still got
the ring on my finger, Trisha.

01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:38.216
You go to bed with it?

01:32:38.303 --> 01:32:39.543
Course I do.

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:44.131
Trisha: All right. Okay, you can't
understand why she's with him.

01:32:44.809 --> 01:32:48.176
Okay, what do you say to people that
criticize you for being with...

01:32:48.271 --> 01:32:49.331
Woman: Well, they don't have...

01:32:49.355 --> 01:32:51.000
Male reporter: Initial claims
that the virus was caused

01:32:51.024 --> 01:32:52.764
by rage infected monkeys

01:32:52.859 --> 01:32:54.724
have now been dismissed as...

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:56.059
Hello.

01:33:02.118 --> 01:33:03.904
What's the plan, then?

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:07.237
Right, a cup of tea,

01:33:07.332 --> 01:33:09.914
then we get the Sundays.

01:33:10.001 --> 01:33:12.492
Head down the Phoenix
for a roast,

01:33:12.587 --> 01:33:14.828
veg out in the pub for a bit,

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:18.503
then wander home, watch a
bit of telly, go to bed.

01:33:18.593 --> 01:33:19.753
Perfect.

01:33:19.844 --> 01:33:21.129
I'll get the kettle on.

01:33:21.221 --> 01:33:22.677
Can I have two sugars, please?

01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:25.471
Adventurous.

01:33:25.558 --> 01:33:27.924
Actually, I might
pop into the garden for a bit.

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:29.975
Go on, then.

01:33:30.063 --> 01:33:31.553
Two seconds.

01:33:43.201 --> 01:33:45.692
Male voice on TV: Player two
has entered the game.

01:33:46.454 --> 01:33:47.614
Ed!

01:33:55.922 --> 01:33:57.082
Yes!

01:34:02.137 --> 01:34:05.220
Ooh, you make me live

01:34:06.057 --> 01:34:09.891
whatever this world
can give to me

01:34:09.978 --> 01:34:13.311
it's you, you're all I see

01:34:14.357 --> 01:34:18.191
ooh, you make me live now honey

01:34:18.444 --> 01:34:21.561
ooh, you make me live

01:34:23.074 --> 01:34:27.909
oh, you're the best friend
that I ever had

01:34:28.246 --> 01:34:31.909
I've been with you
such a long time

01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.865
you're my sunshine

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:38.420
and I want you to know
that my feelings are true

01:34:38.506 --> 01:34:41.418
I really love you

01:34:41.926 --> 01:34:45.214
oh, you're my best friend

01:34:47.765 --> 01:34:50.598
ooh, you make me live

01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:54.052
ooh, I've been wandering round

01:34:54.147 --> 01:34:57.890
but I still come back to you
still come back to you

01:34:57.984 --> 01:35:01.727
in rain or shine
you've stood by me, girl

01:35:01.821 --> 01:35:05.530
I'm happy at home
I'm happy at home

01:35:05.617 --> 01:35:07.983
you're my best friend

01:35:10.121 --> 01:35:13.284
ooh, you make me live

01:35:14.083 --> 01:35:17.166
you, you're my best friend
