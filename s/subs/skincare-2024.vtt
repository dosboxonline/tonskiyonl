WEBVTT

01:59.222 --> 02:01.569
They're almost ready for you,
Miss Goldman.

02:01.673 --> 02:04.572
Perfect.

02:04.676 --> 02:07.092
Okay.

02:07.196 --> 02:08.714
First time in television?

02:08.818 --> 02:10.889
- Why would you say that?
- Oh, nothing.

02:10.992 --> 02:12.822
You'll do great.

02:12.925 --> 02:15.549
- How does my skin look?
- It looks perfect.

02:15.652 --> 02:19.760
You got this.
Listen, you are the best.

02:19.863 --> 02:21.762
Everything is good.
You have nothing to worry about.

02:21.865 --> 02:24.247
Okay?
- Okay.

02:24.351 --> 02:25.904
Okay, good.

02:26.007 --> 02:27.940
Okay, go out there and
show these people who you are.

02:28.044 --> 02:31.220
Okay.
Okay, ready.

02:31.323 --> 02:34.913
Welcome back.

02:35.016 --> 02:38.675
Joining us in the studio today,
aesthetician Hope Goldman.

02:38.779 --> 02:41.609
Hope Goldman is
the owner and namesake

02:41.713 --> 02:45.165
of the Hollywood skincare studio
Hope Goldman Skincare.

02:45.268 --> 02:47.822
Hope, you really are
the American dream.

02:47.926 --> 02:49.272
From a small town,

02:49.376 --> 02:51.274
made it big
as a celebrity facialist.

02:51.378 --> 02:54.933
And now you're launching
your very own line of products.

02:55.036 --> 02:56.383
I wasn't worried,
but thank you.

02:56.486 --> 02:59.006
Hmm.

02:59.109 --> 03:01.319
I heard Brett talking about
how great your products

03:01.422 --> 03:03.562
are, earlier.
- My ears are burning.

03:03.666 --> 03:05.668
- Brett, hello.
- I just wanted to come

03:05.771 --> 03:08.533
and say hi before the taping.
- So good to see you.

03:08.636 --> 03:10.431
I have been telling everyone

03:10.535 --> 03:11.984
how incredible I think
your products are.

03:12.088 --> 03:13.745
I tell you, I am so happy

03:13.848 --> 03:16.368
that you are finally
getting your own line.

03:16.472 --> 03:19.406
It is time people remember
what a pioneer you are.

03:19.509 --> 03:22.719
Mandy, this young lady is
the original skincare queen

03:22.823 --> 03:24.100
in Hollywood,

03:24.204 --> 03:26.620
and soon she's gonna be
a household name.

03:26.723 --> 03:28.863
Alright, I'll see you out there.

03:28.967 --> 03:31.452
Wait, is it true?
Do you make all of this

03:31.556 --> 03:33.040
in Italy?
- Yes, I do.

03:33.143 --> 03:34.697
I know some would say

03:34.800 --> 03:36.664
that creating
the highest-quality products

03:36.768 --> 03:38.528
and then shipping them
from halfway across the world

03:38.632 --> 03:40.289
is not the most obvious
business plan.

03:40.392 --> 03:42.636
But for me, there really was
no other option.

03:42.739 --> 03:45.294
In a business
that's so competitive,

03:45.397 --> 03:46.847
how do you stay relevant?

03:46.950 --> 03:49.263
Oh, well, I don't want to
date myself here,

03:49.367 --> 03:53.267
but reputation is everything
in this business.

03:53.371 --> 03:56.684
And I, um--
I don't see my life,

03:56.788 --> 03:59.549
who I am,
as separate from my work.

03:59.653 --> 04:01.655
Hope Goldman Skincare,
Hope Goldman,

04:01.758 --> 04:05.175
Hope Goldman Skincare.

04:05.279 --> 04:09.007
And I bottled it.
And I bottled it.

04:09.110 --> 04:10.422
I took everything I learned

04:10.526 --> 04:12.217
from a 20-year career
in this business,

04:12.321 --> 04:14.737
and I bottled it.
- Wow.

04:14.840 --> 04:17.567
Well, I guess all that's left
is, where do we get them?

04:17.671 --> 04:18.982
Because I know
I'm gonna want more.

04:20.674 --> 04:22.434
Well, our official launch is
still two weeks away.

04:22.538 --> 04:26.507
So, for now, just through
my studio, HGS, in Hollywood.

04:26.611 --> 04:30.373

to have new neon signs here.

07:03.975 --> 07:05.908
Do you want a new sign?

07:06.011 --> 07:07.979
Maybe if we hadn't ordered
5,000 bottles of toner.

07:08.082 --> 07:09.912
Should I drop this off
at Armen's with the rest?

07:10.015 --> 07:12.915
Yeah. We're out of space, and
he's got room at the garage.

07:13.018 --> 07:14.675
I'll text him,
let him know you're coming.

07:14.779 --> 07:16.090

07:16.194 --> 07:19.128
You know, I am gonna go
visit this neighbor,

07:19.231 --> 07:20.578
see what I can find out.

07:20.681 --> 07:22.234
Hope, remember,
you have Colleen at noon.

07:22.338 --> 07:25.203
Oh, she'll be late.

07:35.903 --> 07:38.423
Hello?

07:44.084 --> 07:47.156
Hello? Neighbor?

07:52.748 --> 07:55.785
What is this place?

08:05.623 --> 08:07.348
- Uh, we're not open yet.
- Oh, I didn't, um,,,

08:07.452 --> 08:08.660
Are you here to make
an appointment?

08:08.764 --> 08:11.767
No, I didn't, um...

08:11.870 --> 08:13.078
I'm Hope.

08:13.182 --> 08:15.391
Hope Goldman Skincare,
just across the way.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.841
- Oh, of course.
- Yeah, right over there.

08:16.944 --> 08:18.670
Ah, I'm Angel.
Angel Vergara.

08:18.774 --> 08:20.327
Nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

08:20.430 --> 08:22.985
- Okay.
- Um, I brought you these.

08:23.088 --> 08:24.745
It's just some of my products.
- Oh.

08:24.849 --> 08:26.402
- You'll love them.
- Thanks.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.335
That's very... sweet of you.
- Yeah.

08:28.438 --> 08:30.095
I developed them in Italy.
- Nice!

08:30.199 --> 08:31.683
I don't know if you have
your own line, but, um,

08:31.787 --> 08:33.478
all those formulas
are copyrighted, though.

08:33.582 --> 08:34.928
That's very smart.

08:35.031 --> 08:38.345
Yeah, I just--
I didn't realize what you were.

08:38.448 --> 08:39.864
What do you mean?

08:39.967 --> 08:43.523
I didn't realize you do skin.

08:43.626 --> 08:46.905
- Jeff didn't tell you that?
- Jeff? No. No.

08:47.009 --> 08:48.044
- Oh.
- Well...

08:48.148 --> 08:49.632
I have a very busy day,
so welcome.

08:49.736 --> 08:51.185
I mean, it's an industry, no?
So...

08:51.289 --> 08:52.911
Yeah.

08:53.015 --> 08:57.606
Listen, I hope you don't think
I'm intruding on your territory.

08:57.709 --> 09:00.643
Why would you even say that?

09:00.747 --> 09:03.819
I don't-- I don't think we
carry the same clientele.

09:03.922 --> 09:07.685
Do you?
- No, no. I don't think so.

09:07.788 --> 09:10.653
- No.
- Cool.

09:10.757 --> 09:12.344
- Good.
- Good.

09:12.448 --> 09:15.037
And I mean, as we're neighbors,

09:15.140 --> 09:17.729
it's-- it's totally fine
if you park there today,

09:17.833 --> 09:20.767
but I think you're
in one of my spots.

09:20.870 --> 09:23.908
They're supposed to be
for Shimmer customers only.

09:31.847 --> 09:33.918
Nice meeting you.

09:43.444 --> 09:46.482
Why would you lease
the space right across from me

09:46.586 --> 09:48.380
to another facialist, Jeff?

09:48.484 --> 09:51.418
I lease to whoever
can pay the rent on time, Hope.

09:51.521 --> 09:53.800
Okay, obviously, there have
been some complications

09:53.903 --> 09:56.837
with my product line,
and it's costing me.

09:56.941 --> 09:58.598
Didn't think of that before?

09:58.701 --> 10:00.151
I had a backer.

10:00.254 --> 10:03.430
I had a silent partner
who funded the development

10:03.533 --> 10:05.466
and was supposed to float me
right through the launch.

10:05.570 --> 10:07.883
The guy up and disappeared.
I mean, it's not my fault.

10:07.986 --> 10:11.196
Hope, we're trying
to run a business, too.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.267
This is not personal. Okay?

10:13.371 --> 10:15.269
Jeff, come on.

10:15.373 --> 10:17.306
How long have you known me?

10:17.409 --> 10:19.446
- Hope...
- 15 years, Jeff.

10:19.549 --> 10:23.139
And in all that time,
have I not been a good tenant?

10:25.314 --> 10:27.627
Yes, yes, yes, of course. Yes.
- Okay.

10:27.730 --> 10:29.076
But it's not like it was
in the beginning.

10:29.180 --> 10:31.285
I have partners now.
We need the money.

10:31.389 --> 10:32.942
Okay, listen,

10:33.046 --> 10:34.841
I really don't think
I'm supposed to tell you this,

10:34.944 --> 10:37.602
but I have taped a segment
for "The Brett & Kylie Show."

10:37.706 --> 10:39.708
It's airing this week.

10:39.811 --> 10:43.056
Things are about to blow up, right?

10:43.159 --> 10:46.197
I'm right back on track here.
And I brought you...

10:46.300 --> 10:51.409
...your own product,
just for you,

10:51.512 --> 10:53.549
on me, from Italy.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.895
Oh.

10:54.999 --> 10:56.725
Because you're a part of this, too.

10:56.828 --> 10:58.312
Well, thank you.

10:58.416 --> 11:00.798
Alright.

11:00.901 --> 11:03.939
Listen, you got to kick
this Angel guy out, alright?

11:04.042 --> 11:06.804
He's walking around
like he owns the place, Jeff.

11:06.907 --> 11:08.081
Hope, can we deal with
your problem right now,

11:08.184 --> 11:09.703
please, first, alright?
- Yeah.

11:09.807 --> 11:11.256
I'm gonna have it for you
next week.

11:11.360 --> 11:13.742
- Monday, Tuesday?
- Whatever you need, Jeff.

11:13.845 --> 11:16.572
Monday, Tuesday.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.953
Okay, but I'll get
the full 90 minutes?

11:18.056 --> 11:20.196
- Oh, of course.
- Colleen. There she is.

11:21.508 --> 11:22.992
- I know. I'm late.
- Oh, please.

11:23.096 --> 11:24.407
We built it into the schedule
this week.

11:24.511 --> 11:25.754
- It's not my fault.
- Oh.

11:25.857 --> 11:28.204
This one was chattering away,

11:28.308 --> 11:29.723
and we sort of
lost track of time.

11:29.827 --> 11:31.104
I see that. Mm-hmm.

11:31.207 --> 11:32.830
We were being bad.
We were being bad.

11:32.933 --> 11:34.728
We were being bad, we were.

11:34.832 --> 11:36.419
You know, you two
should know each other.

11:36.523 --> 11:38.249
He lives in Thai Town.
You're practically neighbors.

11:38.352 --> 11:39.595
- Uh-huh.
- You must be

11:39.699 --> 11:42.149
the miracle worker of Hollywood.
- Hope.

11:42.253 --> 11:43.979
Jordan.
I've heard a lot about you.

11:44.082 --> 11:46.222
Okay, so, what's the verdict?
Am I a lost cause?

11:46.326 --> 11:47.741
Or can you make me
look 19 again?

11:47.845 --> 11:49.605
Well, how old are you?

11:49.709 --> 11:52.850
Unh-unh. 26.

11:52.953 --> 11:55.093
- What? How did--
- Did I tell you or not?

11:55.197 --> 11:56.957
How did you do that?
How did you-- What?

11:57.061 --> 11:59.580
Jordan, you can
entertain Marine.

11:59.684 --> 12:01.134
Are you sure
you don't need my help?

12:01.237 --> 12:02.583
I'm very good with my hands.
- I'm sure you think so.

12:08.382 --> 12:11.282
So, uh, you two are...

12:11.385 --> 12:13.180
Oh, please, he's a baby.

12:13.284 --> 12:14.906
That has never stopped you
before.

12:15.010 --> 12:16.736
I'm not even sure
he's into women.

12:16.839 --> 12:18.496
That's never stopped you
before, either.

12:18.599 --> 12:21.844
Ah, you know young people.

12:21.948 --> 12:23.881
They are so focused these days.

12:23.984 --> 12:25.675
They don't even have time
for sex anymore.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.850
Sounds like me.

12:27.954 --> 12:30.577
I don't know.
He makes me feel...

12:30.680 --> 12:32.682
relevant.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.408
And you wouldn't believe
his story.

12:34.512 --> 12:38.758

you know, like you.

13:33.191 --> 13:34.883
I've actually been really busy.

13:34.986 --> 13:36.539
I've just come back
from filming in Azerbaijan.

13:36.643 --> 13:39.197
- No way. Oh, my goodness.
- Yeah, I know. How crazy.

13:39.301 --> 13:41.993
- You are blowing up!
- Thank you.

13:42.097 --> 13:44.409
What about you? How are things?
- You know, I'm great.

13:44.513 --> 13:46.239
I'm-- I'm finally
launching my own line.

13:46.342 --> 13:48.241
Yeah, it's happening.
Hang on.

13:48.344 --> 13:49.932
I know Marine's
been trying to get you products,

13:50.036 --> 13:53.625
but [Gasps] I have a moisturizer
right here!

13:53.729 --> 13:55.179
I see. So fun!

13:55.282 --> 13:57.319
I'd love for you to share it,
and share it online.

13:57.422 --> 14:00.287
I have a reserve supply
for all my VIPs, like you.

14:00.391 --> 14:02.048
- Oh, you're the best!
- You're never gonna run out.

14:02.151 --> 14:06.017
This reminds me, the place
that's just opened--

14:06.121 --> 14:07.432
the skincare place
across the way.

14:07.536 --> 14:09.089
is that-- is that you?
It looks amazing.

14:09.193 --> 14:11.195
Oh, no, that's--
No, that's not.

14:11.298 --> 14:12.644
I actually--
- That's not?

14:12.748 --> 14:14.577
That's-- That's, like, this--
No.

14:14.681 --> 14:17.477
- Oh. Oh, okay.
- Yeah, but...

14:17.580 --> 14:19.030
- Well...
- Here's your tea.

14:19.134 --> 14:21.446
- Thank you so much.
- Well, this looks fantastic.

14:21.550 --> 14:23.586
I will go again,
and I will see you soon.

14:23.690 --> 14:25.795
Alright.
So good to run into you.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.902
Bye.
Oh.

14:29.006 --> 14:31.387
Uh, excuse me.

14:31.491 --> 14:34.977
Uh, do still you sell, um, cigarettes?

14:35.081 --> 14:36.634
- Oh, yeah.
- Can I get a pack?

14:36.737 --> 14:38.532
- Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. For my friend.

14:38.636 --> 14:40.845
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:38.282 --> 15:40.111
Jordan?

15:40.215 --> 15:42.769
Well, I've only been in L.A.
a few years,

15:42.872 --> 15:44.426
but I already think
it's the best.

15:44.529 --> 15:47.222
Everyone here is so,
like, so real and interesting.

15:47.325 --> 15:48.982
That's-- What?

15:49.086 --> 15:50.984
What?
- Okay. Yeah.

15:51.088 --> 15:53.090
I mean, obviously, there's
a whole superficial side

15:53.193 --> 15:54.988
of things.
There is that.

15:55.092 --> 15:56.058
But then there are
people like you.

15:56.162 --> 15:57.646
- Like me?
- Yeah.

15:57.749 --> 16:00.373
- Oh, yeah? What about me?
- You're killing it.

16:00.476 --> 16:02.582
Aren't you, like, starting
your own line or something?

16:02.685 --> 16:04.204
That's what Colleen told me.
- Come by later this week,

16:04.308 --> 16:05.723
and I'll give you
some samples to try.

16:05.826 --> 16:07.794
See, that is exactly
what I'm talking about.

16:07.897 --> 16:10.521
Everyone is so nice,
and they're living their dreams,

16:10.624 --> 16:14.766
and they're really doing it.
- Well, between you and me,

16:14.870 --> 16:19.150
having your own product line,
it's not all that glamorous.

16:19.254 --> 16:21.290
I mean,
the costs are always piling up,

16:21.394 --> 16:23.223
and you always have to bet
what you've already made

16:23.327 --> 16:24.500
in order to keep up.

16:24.604 --> 16:28.125
And I was a baby
when I started all this.

16:28.228 --> 16:31.852
I was just breaking up
with my ex-husband at the time,

16:31.956 --> 16:35.960
and then I just poured
everything into the business.

16:36.064 --> 16:37.651
You know?
That's what you have to do.

16:37.755 --> 16:39.170
- Mm.
- Hmm.

16:39.274 --> 16:40.827
Listen, I've got to
tell you something.

16:40.930 --> 16:42.967
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no, it's not bad.

16:43.071 --> 16:44.831
I promise.
When I first moved here,

16:44.934 --> 16:46.384
I wanted to be a photographer, right?

16:46.488 --> 16:47.868
So I was working as a free P.A.

16:47.972 --> 16:49.353
for all these different
photo shoots.

16:49.456 --> 16:51.527
And there was one photo shoot
that I worked on

16:51.631 --> 16:53.391
called
"The Seven Faces of Wellness."

16:53.495 --> 16:57.154
- Shut up. No, you did not.
- Yes, yes, I did.

16:57.257 --> 16:59.294
- I don't remember you.
- You wouldn't.

16:59.397 --> 17:01.227
I was barely even there.
But I really remember you.

17:01.330 --> 17:04.368
You know, and I just
remember being so inspired...

17:04.471 --> 17:06.266
- Oh, my God.
- ...by how successful you were.

17:06.370 --> 17:09.062
I'm serious, it, like, really
impacted me for work.

17:09.166 --> 17:12.790
- What is work, exactly?
- I'm a life coach.

17:12.893 --> 17:15.413
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:15.517 --> 17:17.381
Some of it is spiritual,
but then I know martial arts,

17:17.484 --> 17:19.348
so I can teach people
self-defense

17:19.452 --> 17:21.281
in addition
to giving them life guidance.

17:21.385 --> 17:23.249
It's all-- You know,
it's all connected.

17:23.352 --> 17:26.942
Oh. Alright,
I need to get going.

17:27.046 --> 17:29.807
Oh, here.
Before you go, here's my card.

17:29.910 --> 17:31.636
Oh.

17:31.740 --> 17:34.846
Who knows?
Maybe I can, uh, help you.

17:37.711 --> 17:39.575
Maybe you can.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.051
Hello?

18:44.709 --> 18:48.161
Hello.

18:48.265 --> 18:51.509
I can hear you. Hello?

18:51.613 --> 18:55.617
Who is this?

18:55.720 --> 18:58.033
Hello?

19:24.335 --> 19:27.200
Hey, Colleen.
- Are you okay?

19:27.304 --> 19:29.271
Oh, I got this weird text
last night,

19:29.375 --> 19:30.859
but my piece
on "Brett & Kylie"

19:30.962 --> 19:32.274
is airing this morning.

19:32.378 --> 19:33.655
Marine and I
are gonna watch it together.

19:33.758 --> 19:35.312
Hope, what are you
talking about?

19:35.415 --> 19:37.106
Well, you know,
Marine is not just my assistant.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.556
She's kind of head of P.R.,
and--

19:38.660 --> 19:41.939
- Hope, Hope, the e-mail.
- What e-mail?

19:42.042 --> 19:44.700
The one where you talk about
how lonely and horny you are.

19:44.804 --> 19:46.426
Excuse me?

19:46.530 --> 19:48.117
Among other things,
I might add.

19:48.221 --> 19:51.535
Oh. Wait. What?

19:51.638 --> 19:54.365
Colleen, what e-mail?
That's-- That's not me.

19:54.469 --> 19:56.022
Well, should I be worried?

19:56.125 --> 19:59.128
Hold on.
This "Dear friends" thing?

19:59.232 --> 20:02.580
"Dear friends, for so long,
I felt an emptiness inside me.

20:02.684 --> 20:04.375
I can no longer keep this--"
Wait.

20:04.479 --> 20:06.895
What the hell is this?
- Were you drunk last night?

20:06.998 --> 20:09.311
- No!
- Hope! Hey.

20:09.415 --> 20:11.624
- Oh, shit.
- Um, Colleen, uh, hold on.

20:11.727 --> 20:13.660
- Hey. Are you okay?
- Hi, Jeff.

20:13.764 --> 20:16.215
Um, yeah, Marine, I know
you need me do that thing.

20:16.318 --> 20:17.975
What thing?
What are you talking about?

20:18.078 --> 20:19.701
- I know. Yeah, yeah, I know.
- I wanted to ask you about...

20:19.804 --> 20:22.290
Marine needs me to do
the thing I promised her,

20:22.393 --> 20:24.395
so I'm going to come by later.
But, hey, don't forget

20:24.499 --> 20:27.018
to watch me
on "Brett & Kylie," okay?

20:27.122 --> 20:28.710
- Alright.
- Okay, great. Hold on.

20:28.813 --> 20:30.505
Hold on. Where did it go?
"I don't feel like myself.

20:30.608 --> 20:34.750
I feel a profound loneliness"?
Jesus Christ!

20:34.854 --> 20:36.338
Sorry, sorry. Thank you.

20:36.442 --> 20:38.375
Okay.
- Keep reading.

20:38.478 --> 20:41.481
"I feel like the inside
of my body is turning to ash"?

20:41.585 --> 20:43.656
What?
"And time is running out.

20:43.759 --> 20:46.072
When I wake up in the morning,
all I want is a..."

20:46.175 --> 20:48.039
Oh!
..."a hard dick"?

20:48.143 --> 20:50.110
- There it is.
- Oh, my God.

20:50.214 --> 20:53.631
"I'm reaching out to you,
all my clients and my friends,

20:53.735 --> 20:55.081
to ask for help.

20:55.184 --> 20:57.048
I am badly in debt,
potentially losing my business."

20:57.152 --> 20:58.671
What?

20:58.774 --> 21:01.156
"And desperately want
someone to fuck my brains out"?

21:01.260 --> 21:03.192
I mean, are you kidding? Oh!
- Oh, Jesus...

21:03.296 --> 21:05.816
- Fuck!
- I mean, excuse me.

21:05.919 --> 21:08.991
- Yeah, exactly. Excuse you.
- Wow.

21:09.095 --> 21:10.993
Are you taking
a new medication?

21:11.097 --> 21:13.686
This is obviously not me.
Someone's using my e-mail.

21:13.789 --> 21:17.103
Well, it says it's from you to
everybody in your address book.

21:17.206 --> 21:19.105
- Oh, my God. Jesus.
- And BCC.

21:19.208 --> 21:21.487
I can see that.
Okay, just what do I do?

21:21.590 --> 21:23.212
- Well, I mean...
- How do I...

21:27.216 --> 21:29.115
Hope, were you
out drinking last night?

21:29.218 --> 21:31.359
I was not, Marine. Obviously.

21:31.462 --> 21:35.846
I mean, Jesus, it doesn't
even sound like me, does it?

21:35.949 --> 21:39.194
Well, it's not me, Marine.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.956
I know, I just...

21:43.060 --> 21:44.510
Answer it.

21:44.613 --> 21:46.443
Hi.

21:46.546 --> 21:47.927
This is
Hope Goldman Skincare.

21:48.030 --> 21:51.482
Okay. Fine. Okay.

21:51.586 --> 21:53.726
Thank you for calling.
- What was it? Who was it?

21:53.829 --> 21:56.280
It's Bet Clarkson.
She-- She canceled.

21:56.384 --> 21:58.420
And Renee, as well.
- Oh, Okay.

21:58.524 --> 21:59.663
Here's what we're gonna do.

21:59.766 --> 22:03.460
You are going to e-mail
everybody.

22:03.563 --> 22:05.565
The entire client list, okay?
And call.

22:05.669 --> 22:08.223
Call them, too,
and explain the situation.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.294
We've been hacked,
and it's no big deal,

22:10.398 --> 22:12.020
but we just wanted to let
everyone know

22:12.123 --> 22:14.160
so there's no confusion.
Right?

22:14.263 --> 22:16.058
Because it's not me.
- Yes. Yes. Got it.

22:16.162 --> 22:17.715
I'm gonna make sure
I change all the passwords.

22:17.819 --> 22:19.614
- Yes, obviously. Right. Okay.
- And, Hope,

22:19.717 --> 22:22.271
as your head of P.R.,
we can handle this.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.790
- Yes.
- Okay?

22:23.894 --> 22:25.274
Alright. Okay. Okay.

22:25.378 --> 22:27.898
Oh, my God. Fuck.
- What?

22:28.001 --> 22:31.729
Margaret.
Margaret got the e-mail. Shit.

22:31.833 --> 22:33.352
Okay, okay,
we can call her first, then.

22:33.455 --> 22:34.801
Yeah, that's good.
That's good. Call her.

22:34.905 --> 22:36.941
- Also, Brett called.
- Oh, call him back.

22:37.045 --> 22:39.634
Call him back right fucking now.

22:39.737 --> 22:43.154
Okay.
Jesus Christ.

22:43.258 --> 22:44.777
It's a limited-time offer.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.468
You can drive the car
off the lot...

22:46.572 --> 22:48.159
- There's no answer.
- 0% financing.

22:48.263 --> 22:49.885
Oh, my God.
The show is almost on.

22:49.989 --> 22:54.580
This is going to be
great content.

22:54.683 --> 22:56.098
Are you gonna film me?

22:56.202 --> 22:57.686
- Yes. Are you kidding?
- Oh! Okay.

22:57.790 --> 22:59.895
You look great.

22:59.999 --> 23:01.621
Welcome back.

23:01.725 --> 23:04.969
So, if your skin tells
the world your story,

23:05.073 --> 23:10.043
then our next guest might
just be your new guardian angel.

23:10.147 --> 23:12.149
Angel Vergara joins us today.

23:12.252 --> 23:15.048
He's the owner of Shimmer
the new and, so we hear,

23:15.152 --> 23:17.775
hottest salon in Hollywood.

23:17.879 --> 23:19.743
Thank you so much
for having me.

23:19.846 --> 23:21.469
Oh, my God.
- Now, you're saying

23:21.572 --> 23:24.403
that you are using
technology developed by NASA

23:24.506 --> 23:27.095
on people's skin?
- That is correct, Brett.

23:27.198 --> 23:29.338
I cannot believe this!
This is some bullshit!

23:29.442 --> 23:31.064
- Shh. Quiet.
- At his moment,

23:31.168 --> 23:35.724
we maintain the exclusive rights
to microgravity body chambers,

23:35.828 --> 23:39.176
which can reverse
the effects of aging.

23:39.279 --> 23:41.074
- Reverse?
- Yes, sir.

23:41.178 --> 23:43.870
I don't know any other technique
or any other facialist,

23:43.974 --> 23:45.320
I don't care
how skilled they are,

23:45.424 --> 23:47.460
who can compete.
- That sounds incredible.

23:47.564 --> 23:49.497
It is incredible,

23:49.600 --> 23:51.568
because at Shimmer,
we are the future of skincare.

23:51.671 --> 23:54.536
I'm sure that your new place
is already solidly booked

23:54.640 --> 23:56.124
for the next two months.
- Yes.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.402
How do I get an appointment?

23:58.506 --> 24:00.439
Mm, I think I know someone
who can help.

24:00.542 --> 24:02.026
It's this guy.

24:02.130 --> 24:03.821
- Yeah.
- I think-- I got five bucks,

24:03.925 --> 24:06.341
says it's this guy right here.
That is incredibly good.

24:06.445 --> 24:09.517
What a...

24:09.620 --> 24:11.346
Don't-- No.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.245
Nothing...

24:18.802 --> 24:22.564
Hope?

24:31.608 --> 24:34.645
Aaaaah!

24:35.197 --> 24:39.478
Thanks again for this ride.
I can't find my goddamn keys.

24:39.581 --> 24:40.996
I did not want to be late
to meet this guy.

24:41.100 --> 24:43.551
Oh, my God. No.
I'm so glad that I could help.

24:43.654 --> 24:45.587
That's why I gave you my card.

24:45.691 --> 24:47.934
What's, uh--
What's the meeting for?

24:48.038 --> 24:50.385
Or is that-- is that
top secret?

24:50.489 --> 24:52.560
- Oh...
- Wait, is this--

24:52.663 --> 24:54.907
Am I dropping you off
on a date right now?

24:55.010 --> 24:56.633
Is that what's happening?
- No, no, no, no.

24:56.736 --> 24:59.187
It's just, I'm meeting a guy
from this TV show.

24:59.290 --> 25:02.259
- Wow, that is so cool.
- It's a long story.

25:02.362 --> 25:04.537
This is it, right up here.
- Yeah.

25:04.641 --> 25:08.886
Okay, well,
come by later this week.

25:08.990 --> 25:10.578
- Yeah.
- And I'll hook you up

25:10.681 --> 25:11.751
with everything.
- Oh, my God.

25:11.855 --> 25:13.235
- Alright?
- Okay. Yeah.

25:13.339 --> 25:14.996
- Thanks again.
- Don't mention it.

25:15.099 --> 25:16.687
I'll see you soon.

25:16.791 --> 25:19.414
This Angel guy--
so, he's right there,

25:19.518 --> 25:22.106
and then I get hacked.
I-I'm...

25:22.210 --> 25:24.902
You know how
people love a scandal.

25:25.006 --> 25:26.939
I would have ignored it myself, honestly.

25:27.042 --> 25:30.045
But [Sighs] now
my producers got it.

25:30.149 --> 25:31.391
Oh, Jesus.

25:31.495 --> 25:32.841
And we'd already filmed
Angel's segment,

25:32.945 --> 25:35.844
so they decided
to bump your spot and air his.

25:35.948 --> 25:39.330
I mean, just right
before the product launch.

25:39.434 --> 25:41.056
I mean,
you don't think this is--

25:41.160 --> 25:44.335
it's just so perfect, you know,
can it really be a coincidence?

25:44.439 --> 25:45.474
Well, I don't know about that.

25:45.578 --> 25:46.545
No, I'm not gonna argue
with you

25:46.648 --> 25:47.960
the timing is unfortunate,

25:48.063 --> 25:50.238
but I-I wouldn't read
too much into it.

25:50.341 --> 25:54.276
But the world and,
let's face it, the Internet

25:54.380 --> 25:55.830
is full of sickos.

25:55.933 --> 25:58.039
Beauty is a cutthroat business.

25:58.142 --> 26:00.075
Business is
a cutthroat business.

26:00.179 --> 26:03.941
Are you wearing makeup?

26:04.045 --> 26:06.116
Caught. Guilty as charged.
Yes, I am wear--

26:06.219 --> 26:07.669
I didn't wash my face
after the taping.

26:07.773 --> 26:09.084
I didn't think you'd notice.

26:09.188 --> 26:10.603
Honestly, with
the lighting in there,

26:10.707 --> 26:11.984
I didn't think
anybody would notice.

26:12.087 --> 26:13.019
No, no, no.
I think it looks good.

26:13.123 --> 26:14.227
Thank you.

26:14.331 --> 26:15.850
Gives you nice contouring,
right in there.

26:15.953 --> 26:17.403
They contour a little bit
around the jaw.

26:17.506 --> 26:19.405
No, no,
it gives you definition.

26:19.508 --> 26:20.958
Thank you, thank you.
Of course--

26:21.062 --> 26:23.512
Of course you would clock it.
- Well...

26:23.616 --> 26:25.998
You are so talented.

26:26.101 --> 26:27.862
It's no surprise
that your products are amazing.

26:27.965 --> 26:29.933
Well, I'm so glad
you like them.

26:30.036 --> 26:31.555
And even more glad
you're gonna help

26:31.659 --> 26:34.075
get that segment
back on the air.

26:46.915 --> 26:49.159
Okay, thanks again for dinner.

26:49.262 --> 26:51.230
It was so nice
after such a rough day.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.439
Oh, it was my pleasure.
It was my pleasure.

26:53.542 --> 26:55.130
And I'm gonna do
everything I can

26:55.234 --> 26:57.616
to make sure that your segment
gets on the show next week.

26:57.719 --> 27:00.515
Oh, Brett, thank you.
It's perfect.

27:02.137 --> 27:06.210
My God, you are
just so... fucking hot.

27:06.314 --> 27:09.662
Uh, um, um...

27:12.492 --> 27:14.633
Oh. Hold on, I just, uh...

27:14.736 --> 27:16.531
Marine has been calling me
all night.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.084
I'm sure
she'll be fine.

27:18.188 --> 27:19.914
No, I just missed,
like, so many of her calls.

27:20.017 --> 27:22.502
- It's such a long day.
- I know, yeah.

27:22.606 --> 27:25.264
Um...

27:25.367 --> 27:27.335
Sorry. Um...

27:27.438 --> 27:29.440
Are you married, Brett?

27:29.544 --> 27:31.891
I mean, yeah.

27:31.995 --> 27:33.962
Uh, yes, but, um...

27:34.066 --> 27:36.137
we've been having problems.

27:36.240 --> 27:37.932
Oh.

27:38.035 --> 27:40.072
- Probably gonna get a divorce.
- Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

27:40.175 --> 27:42.384
- It's been hell, it's been hell.
- Yeah.

27:42.488 --> 27:44.593
I know, divorce is so tough.

27:44.697 --> 27:46.734
But you and I--

27:46.837 --> 27:49.840
I thought we had a connection.

27:49.944 --> 27:53.430
I feel that way, too. I do.
I...

27:53.533 --> 27:57.330
But I didn't mean
to mislead you.

27:57.434 --> 27:59.643
I-- It's just your show's
reach is so large

27:59.747 --> 28:02.025
and the product line and...
- Okay.

28:02.128 --> 28:04.544
...this e-mail thing,
and I just knew that you...

28:04.648 --> 28:07.686
How about this?
Let's make a little deal.

28:07.789 --> 28:11.344
I'll get your segment
on the show,

28:11.448 --> 28:16.556
and you... will...

28:16.660 --> 28:19.352
What? I'll what?

28:19.456 --> 28:21.492
You give me a blow job.

28:23.736 --> 28:25.220
Right here in the car?

28:25.324 --> 28:27.947
Or in the house if you want.
Honestly, I don't care.

28:28.051 --> 28:30.501
But this is a pretty good deal, huh?

28:32.607 --> 28:34.782
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

28:34.885 --> 28:36.300
We're right in the middle
of something here.

28:36.404 --> 28:38.578
I just-- I was accidentally
recording that.

28:38.682 --> 28:40.753
- What?
- I accidentally--

28:40.857 --> 28:42.686
How do you stop?
There we go, stopped it.

28:42.790 --> 28:46.207
Okay.
Oh.

28:46.310 --> 28:47.553
Sorry.

28:47.656 --> 28:49.313
You have to delete that, obviously.

28:49.417 --> 28:52.316
- Obviously. Yeah, I deleted it.
- You deleted the recording?

28:52.420 --> 28:55.561
- I just deleted it, Brett.
- Can I just see your phone,

28:55.664 --> 28:58.357
just for a second?
- I just told you, I deleted it.

28:58.460 --> 29:01.015
Brett, come on...
- Can I just-- Let me just--

29:01.118 --> 29:03.120
Can I see your phone, please?
- Brett!

29:03.224 --> 29:07.435
How long have you known me?
You know

29:07.538 --> 29:10.403
I would never intentionally
hurt anyone in that way.

29:12.095 --> 29:14.994
Thank you.
You're a good friend.

29:22.864 --> 29:27.938
♪ Once, when spring was new

29:28.042 --> 29:35.118
♪ High on a hill

29:35.221 --> 29:37.706
- Did you forget something?
- I could not find those.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.018
I looked everywhere.

29:39.122 --> 29:41.849
I was late,
and I almost missed it.

29:41.952 --> 29:44.230
But Jordan gave me a ride.
- Jordan?

29:44.334 --> 29:47.544
Was he looking for me?
- No, I called him.

29:47.647 --> 29:49.926
- Really?
- Also, I told him

29:50.029 --> 29:51.686
to come by
for some products this week.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.930
Well, how was everything
with Brett?

29:54.033 --> 29:55.966
Mm. I handled it.

29:56.070 --> 29:57.899
They're gonna air
the segment next week.

29:58.003 --> 30:00.143
Great.
That's even better timing.

30:00.246 --> 30:03.180
Hey, you don't think
this-- this Angel guy

30:03.284 --> 30:04.975
could have gotten into
our e-mails, do you?

30:05.079 --> 30:08.634
What? No.
How would he even do that?

30:08.737 --> 30:10.843
Look, I tried
calling you last night.

30:10.947 --> 30:12.741
We've been getting
some really strange messages.

30:12.845 --> 30:14.088
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

30:14.191 --> 30:15.779
I assumed it was
because of the hacking,

30:15.883 --> 30:17.401
but these aren't coming from
our mailing list.

30:17.505 --> 30:20.059
They're really sexual
and aggressive.

30:24.892 --> 30:26.617
Is Jessica coming in today?

30:26.721 --> 30:28.447
Not that I have in my calendar.

30:28.550 --> 30:30.380
Hope, these messages
are all asking for you,

30:30.483 --> 30:32.796
and they're pretty graphic.
- Oh, what?

30:32.900 --> 30:35.281
Don't forget,
you have Pam soon.

31:05.415 --> 31:09.937
- Oh, my God, I'm so happy.
- I'm so glad to be here.

31:10.040 --> 31:13.526
Oh, oh. Ohhh.

31:15.701 --> 31:18.566
That bitch.

31:33.167 --> 31:34.893
Traitor.
- Uh, what?

31:34.996 --> 31:36.825
What, do you need
your asshole bleached?

31:36.929 --> 31:38.310
- What?
- Excuse me?

31:38.413 --> 31:40.243
Can I help you?
- Are you kidding right now?

31:40.346 --> 31:42.659
Listen, it's nothing.
I'm just here to get a facial.

31:42.762 --> 31:45.213
Jessica, how long?!

31:45.317 --> 31:47.043
How long have
I been helping you?!

31:47.146 --> 31:48.734
- I think you should go.
- Look, it's nothing personal.

31:48.837 --> 31:51.495
- It's fucking personal, Jessica.
- Hope, please. Hey.

31:51.599 --> 31:53.946
Jessica, Jessica,
you walk through there--

31:54.050 --> 31:57.329
Hey, you walk back there
and you are never, ever

31:57.432 --> 31:59.676
allowed in my studio again.
Do you understand?

31:59.779 --> 32:01.229
You're crossing a line
right now.

32:01.333 --> 32:02.990
Jessica, please go in.
I'll be there in a minute.

32:03.093 --> 32:04.612
- Jessica!
- Hope...

32:04.715 --> 32:06.234
- Jessica.
- ...chill.

32:06.338 --> 32:09.030
- Jessica, just come with me.
- Calm down, please.

32:11.895 --> 32:13.517
Good luck
with your cystic acne!

32:13.621 --> 32:15.657
Oh, that's your
fucking problem now, isn't it?

32:15.761 --> 32:18.315
I would appreciate it if
you don't scream at my clients.

32:18.419 --> 32:19.972
<i>Your</i> clients?
Are you proud of yourself?

32:20.076 --> 32:21.836
As you can see,
we're very busy right now,

32:21.940 --> 32:24.114
so if you don't mind...

32:24.218 --> 32:26.806
I'm not going anywhere.

32:39.819 --> 32:41.925
Fuck you!

What the fuck?

33:15.062 --> 33:17.098
Oh, my God.

33:19.514 --> 33:20.653
Hey! Hey!

33:20.757 --> 33:22.966
Did you see who did this?

33:23.070 --> 33:26.211
Huh?

33:26.314 --> 33:28.075
<i>Habla Inglés</i>?

33:28.178 --> 33:30.974
Nothing? No help?

33:31.078 --> 33:33.252
Because I'm calling the police.
Okay?

33:33.356 --> 33:36.911
The police!

33:37.015 --> 33:39.603
911. What's your emergency?

33:39.707 --> 33:42.917
Um, somebody just, uh,
slashed all my tires,

33:43.021 --> 33:44.746
and... I-I need...

33:44.850 --> 33:46.748
I'm at Crossroads of the World
in Hollywood,

33:46.852 --> 33:48.474
uh, in the back parking lot.

33:48.578 --> 33:50.718
Um, I need help.

33:50.821 --> 33:52.133
Is anyone there with you?

33:52.237 --> 33:57.414
Uh, no, I-I'm alone.
I'm all alone.

34:10.082 --> 34:11.670
Ready?
- Yeah.

34:11.773 --> 34:15.053
Thank God you picked up.

34:15.156 --> 34:17.089
I really wasn't sure
if you'd be open.

34:17.193 --> 34:18.194
Aw, we're always open.

34:18.297 --> 34:19.816
You know, pretty scary stuff.

34:19.919 --> 34:24.890
When someone slashes your tires,
that's a clear message.

34:24.993 --> 34:26.788
What's the message?

34:26.892 --> 34:28.583
If I were you,
I'd make a list of my enemies,

34:28.687 --> 34:30.344
go through one by one,
who out there

34:30.447 --> 34:32.311
might want to hurt you.
Right?

34:32.415 --> 34:36.591
I am, um--
I'm getting these messages.

34:41.044 --> 34:43.184
You want a gun?

34:43.288 --> 34:45.462
That's okay.
I'll teach you how to shoot it.

34:45.566 --> 34:47.533

getting a gun.

34:52.020 --> 34:53.263
- Be safe, Hope.
- Thank you.

34:53.367 --> 34:54.747
I won't charge you
for the tires.

34:54.851 --> 34:57.267
Oh no, Armen, please.
Let me-- I got it.

34:57.371 --> 34:59.062
Oh, no, no, no. Come on.

You're too good to me.

35:03.929 --> 35:07.001
You know, Hope,
I care about you.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.763
- Yeah, I care about you, too.
- No, no, no.

35:10.867 --> 35:13.766
I want you to know
that if you're in trouble,

35:13.870 --> 35:15.423
you can call me.

35:15.527 --> 35:18.323
I've dealt with some real bad
fucking guys in my time.

35:18.426 --> 35:21.533
That's good to know.

35:21.636 --> 35:23.190
Okay.

35:23.293 --> 35:26.331
Alright, well,
you got new tires on the car.

35:26.434 --> 35:28.436
Your product is safe and sound

and then
start your background check?

37:16.613 --> 37:20.410
- Uh, okay. What's FST?
- Fire safety test.

37:20.514 --> 37:23.310
Oh, okay. I'm not--
I'm not good at tests.

37:23.413 --> 37:26.140
It's really easy. It's--
It's more of a formality.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.659
It's not...

37:27.762 --> 37:29.557
And then, the background check,
about 10 days,

37:29.661 --> 37:31.283
and then--
and then she's yours.

37:31.387 --> 37:34.390
Oh, well, I need something
more immediately.

37:34.493 --> 37:36.288
Like, I need something,
like, today.

37:36.392 --> 37:39.291
Oh, okay.

37:39.395 --> 37:44.020
- What about that?
- It's a classic. 30 bucks?

37:50.302 --> 37:51.476
- Hope!
- Oh!

37:51.579 --> 37:54.133
Oh.
Sorry.

37:54.237 --> 37:55.652
I didn't mean to startle you.

37:55.756 --> 37:57.896
- Hey, this is my grandson, Ben.
- Hi.

37:57.999 --> 38:00.692
Yeah, we were just shopping
for some equipment

38:00.795 --> 38:03.246
for a little fishing trip.
- Oh, cool, yeah.

38:03.350 --> 38:05.731
Hi, little boy.
- Hey, Ben,

38:05.835 --> 38:07.008
why don't you go
to the bait counter?

38:07.112 --> 38:10.391
I'll catch up with you, okay?

38:10.495 --> 38:11.841
Hope it was about the, uh--
the rent.

38:11.944 --> 38:14.292
No, no, I--
Jeff that's handled, okay?

38:14.395 --> 38:16.121
Oh, that's great.
Well, I'll stop by tomorrow

38:16.224 --> 38:17.571
and pick it up.
- Okay.

38:17.674 --> 38:18.779
Yeah, I knew
you'd figure it out.

38:18.882 --> 38:20.159
Thanks. Okay.

38:20.263 --> 38:21.368
So, I have a client
that I'm late for.

38:21.471 --> 38:24.094
- Bye.
- Okay. I'll stop by.

38:29.203 --> 38:31.654
Alright, come back.

38:34.035 --> 38:38.316
Margaret, thank you again
for being so understanding

38:38.419 --> 38:39.696
about the e-mail.

38:39.800 --> 38:42.250
Oh, I get it.
I've been hacked before.

38:42.354 --> 38:46.220
Plus, I'd be totally insane to
pass on a free facial from you.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.326
Oh, well, it's my treat.

38:48.429 --> 38:50.569
Your audience
is gonna love these products.

38:50.673 --> 38:51.915
When we're done here,

38:52.019 --> 38:53.434
I'll take you through
the whole line.

38:53.538 --> 38:56.506
Your support
means so much to me.

39:11.556 --> 39:12.798
I'm sorry. Can I help you?

39:12.902 --> 39:14.731
Yeah. I'm looking for
Hope Goldman.

39:14.835 --> 39:17.009
She's with a client right now.
Do you have an appointment?

39:17.113 --> 39:19.080
Oh, yeah.

39:19.184 --> 39:21.289
It wasn't clear to me,
you needed an appointment.

39:25.086 --> 39:26.260
Well, what's your name?

39:26.364 --> 39:28.814
I'd rather not say.

39:28.918 --> 39:31.645
I'm sorry,
we don't do walk-ins.

39:31.748 --> 39:34.337
Is there something
I can help you with?

39:34.441 --> 39:36.477
- I'm here for the posting.
- The what?

39:36.581 --> 39:38.376
For Hope, her posting.

39:38.479 --> 39:40.688
Do you need a facial or...

39:40.792 --> 39:43.277
Yeah. Yeah,
I'll take the whole menu.

39:43.381 --> 39:48.558
I'm-- I'm sure you
can schedule a con--

39:48.662 --> 39:50.353
- Huh?
- A consultation. You can--

39:50.457 --> 39:52.217
Why? Is that part of it?

39:52.320 --> 39:53.805
Now, look,
online it said that--

39:53.908 --> 39:55.565
Sorry, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

39:55.669 --> 39:59.120
What the fuck is up
with this cocktease bullshit?!

40:02.745 --> 40:05.403
- Uh, Margaret.
- Mm-hmm?

40:05.506 --> 40:09.614
Uh, excuse me.

40:09.717 --> 40:11.270
Just excuse me for one sec, okay?

40:11.374 --> 40:12.651
Yeah, of course.

40:12.755 --> 40:15.240
Just got to go
and see what's going on.

40:17.760 --> 40:20.245
Uh, excuse me?
- Are you Hope Goldman?

40:20.348 --> 40:21.936
How can we help you?

40:22.040 --> 40:23.386
He said he came here
to fuck you.

40:23.490 --> 40:24.629
Fuck is wrong
with you bitches?!

40:24.732 --> 40:26.009
Hey!
Hey, you piece of shit,

40:26.113 --> 40:27.666
you need to get out of here
right now!

40:27.770 --> 40:29.254
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, what's going on?

40:29.357 --> 40:30.497
He said he came here
to fuck Hope.

40:30.600 --> 40:31.981
- What?!
- Marine!

40:32.084 --> 40:33.741
You hard of hearing, dipshit?
What the fuck?!

40:33.845 --> 40:36.882
Get your fucking hands off me!

40:36.986 --> 40:39.022
Don't ever
come to my friends again.

40:39.126 --> 40:42.785
Okay? You understand me?
Get the fuck out of here, bro!

40:42.888 --> 40:44.614
Oh, my God.

40:44.718 --> 40:46.513
You fucking freaks!

40:46.616 --> 40:49.930
I was just trying to get laid.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.386
Click on that first one,
right there.

41:04.323 --> 41:07.741
- This is so fucked.
- Look at all these postings.

41:07.844 --> 41:10.260
Can you click on the one
with the photo?

41:12.400 --> 41:14.782
- What the fuck?
- That's her face.

41:14.886 --> 41:18.027
Someone is trying
to destroy me.

41:18.130 --> 41:19.615
Do you have any idea

41:19.718 --> 41:21.824
who might have access
to pictures of your face?

41:21.927 --> 41:24.240
What do you think?
That's-- I'm a public figure.

41:24.343 --> 41:27.554
She's in magazines, dude.
It's, like, everywhere.

41:27.657 --> 41:28.900
This could just be
a couple of kids

41:29.003 --> 41:30.833
pulling a prank,
but don't worry,

41:30.936 --> 41:32.524
we'll get to the bottom of it.
- What if someone comes back?

41:32.628 --> 41:34.630
What if somebody else
reads one of these

41:34.733 --> 41:36.735
and shows up again?
- Okay.

41:36.839 --> 41:38.599
You know, he got hurt.
He was attacked.

41:38.703 --> 41:41.015
I never give out
my direct line,

41:41.119 --> 41:43.570
but in this case, I will.

41:43.673 --> 41:46.331
Please use it discerningly.

41:46.434 --> 41:47.746
Okay, we're gonna get to work.

41:47.850 --> 41:50.059
Alright, let's head out.

41:50.162 --> 41:54.995
- I mean, that's it.
- Don't worry.

41:55.098 --> 41:56.962
Can we get these
off the Internet?

41:57.066 --> 41:59.240
I'll make sure.

42:03.900 --> 42:06.696
I'm so sorry, Hope,
they keep popping up.

42:06.800 --> 42:09.527
How many pages are there?

42:09.630 --> 42:12.322
They keep coming back.
I don't know.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.264
You've reached
Hope Goldman Skincare.

42:23.368 --> 42:26.164
We're taking a self-care day
today, and you should, too.

42:26.267 --> 42:28.304
We'll be back tomorrow,
booking appointments

42:28.407 --> 42:30.893
and taking preorder
for our new line of products,

42:30.996 --> 42:32.619
available now at the studio

42:32.722 --> 42:35.000
and launching officially
next week.

42:35.104 --> 42:37.796
Leave a message,
and we'll get back to you.

42:37.900 --> 42:39.833
You sit down.
I'll grab the food.

42:39.936 --> 42:42.283
So lucky you were there today.

42:42.387 --> 42:45.390
- Oh.
- I'm just so-- Thank God.

42:45.493 --> 42:47.426
Well, selfishly, I'm thrilled.

42:47.530 --> 42:49.946
I was just coming back
for some samples,

42:50.050 --> 42:53.398
and now I'm getting a face mask.

42:53.501 --> 42:54.882
It's the least I can do.

42:54.986 --> 42:58.610
Can I ask you--
Can I ask you something?

42:58.714 --> 42:59.853
Of course.

42:59.956 --> 43:04.547
Okay, if I were
a client,

43:04.651 --> 43:08.447
what advice would you give me
for my business?

43:08.551 --> 43:11.105
Uh...

43:11.209 --> 43:14.902
Okay, well, I have to warn you,
I'm gonna be honest.

43:15.006 --> 43:17.008
You have to promise
that you won't get offended.

43:17.111 --> 43:19.251
- Okay.
- Promise?

43:19.355 --> 43:21.012
- Yeah, I promise.
- Okay.

43:21.115 --> 43:23.083
Here, give me your hands.

43:27.190 --> 43:31.298
One of your gifts, Hope--
One of your many gifts,

43:31.401 --> 43:33.438
is that you make people
feel really comfortable.

43:33.541 --> 43:35.060
When people are
in your presence,

43:35.164 --> 43:38.719
they feel completely at ease
and relaxed.

43:38.823 --> 43:40.134
But what about the people

43:40.238 --> 43:42.309
who haven't had the chance
to meet you?

43:42.412 --> 43:43.828
You know?

43:43.931 --> 43:45.899
The ones who you really
want to buy your products?

43:46.002 --> 43:49.419
I mean,
your career is legendary, right?

43:49.523 --> 43:51.387
Your products are flawless.

43:51.490 --> 43:55.149
And your story is
inspiring as hell.

43:55.253 --> 43:57.496
Why are these three things
connected?

43:57.600 --> 44:03.226
You have to put Hope Goldman
in front of this business.

44:03.330 --> 44:06.057
There are so many lies about you
on the Internet right now.

44:06.160 --> 44:07.852
We have to counteract
all this terrible shit

44:07.955 --> 44:11.027
and just-- just take control
of your narrative.

44:11.131 --> 44:13.133
Right?
So, what does that look like?

44:13.236 --> 44:16.999
A social-media account for work,
ads online, stuff like that.

44:17.102 --> 44:19.864
But it is also about the work
that we do in real life.

44:19.967 --> 44:22.211
So what I'm thinking is,
we could, I don't know,

44:22.314 --> 44:24.938
like, throw a launch party
at your studio

44:25.041 --> 44:26.525
for your new product line,

44:26.629 --> 44:28.113
where I invite some
of my model friends,

44:28.217 --> 44:30.771
you invite your VIP clients.
It would be amazing.

44:30.875 --> 44:35.673
But more importantly,
it would tell the right story.

44:45.303 --> 44:47.132
You're right.

44:47.236 --> 44:50.860
You're fucking right.

44:50.964 --> 44:54.001
How do we start?

44:54.105 --> 44:57.522
Okay, so, it's not perfect,
but it's a start.

44:57.625 --> 44:58.937
- Hope Goldman Skincare.
- Yeah.

44:59.041 --> 45:00.180
Tilt your head back
just a little bit.

45:00.283 --> 45:01.802
Yeah. Yeah.

45:03.666 --> 45:06.704
You know,
whatever you do to your face,

45:06.807 --> 45:08.360
you should always do
to your neck.

45:08.464 --> 45:09.845
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

45:09.948 --> 45:11.467
I told you I used to be
a photographer, right?

45:11.570 --> 45:14.263
You told me you were a P.A.
on some photo shoots.

45:14.366 --> 45:16.575
Did you ever model?

45:16.679 --> 45:18.336
I mean...

45:18.439 --> 45:21.649
You did, didn't you?
You did. I knew it.

45:24.963 --> 45:26.827
- Wow.
- Oh, yeah. Do you see that?

45:26.931 --> 45:28.242
- Yeah. Perfect.
- Look at you.

45:28.346 --> 45:29.968
Look out.
Like, look out to the pool.

45:30.072 --> 45:33.420
Are you kidding me right now?
Yes. Okay.

45:33.523 --> 45:34.939
That's probably the best picture

45:35.042 --> 45:36.595
I've ever taken in
my whole life, right there.

45:36.699 --> 45:39.391
- Let me see.
- Yeah. Your first post.

45:42.912 --> 45:46.260
Oh, wait.
It's getting kind of red.

45:46.364 --> 45:48.918
Yeah, let me
get something for it.

45:50.506 --> 45:52.301
Oh, yeah.

45:52.404 --> 45:56.857
I mean, Hope,
these are incredible.

45:56.961 --> 45:58.479
- Thank you.
- This is-- No, I'm serious.

45:58.583 --> 45:59.895
Look at that.

45:59.998 --> 46:01.862
That's your profile picture
right there.

46:01.966 --> 46:04.416
Okay.
If you say so.

46:04.520 --> 46:06.798
Okay, come here.

46:06.902 --> 46:10.664
That doesn't hurt, does it?

46:10.768 --> 46:13.080
No.

46:39.451 --> 46:42.592
- It's alright. Thank you.
- Oh, fuck.

46:54.294 --> 46:57.193
Hey, Brett,
I was just thinking about you.

46:57.297 --> 47:00.127
Hi, Hope, listen, um,
I'm sorry about what happened.

47:00.231 --> 47:02.785
Um, yeah, hey,
oh, thanks again for dinner.

47:02.889 --> 47:07.238
Um, that was, um,
so sweet of you.

47:07.341 --> 47:09.999
Uh, nice to catch up.
- Yeah, it was, it was.

47:10.103 --> 47:11.380
I'm just wondering,

47:11.483 --> 47:13.140
when do you think
my segment is gonna air?

47:13.244 --> 47:16.178
Look, I-I need to know
that you deleted that recording.

47:16.281 --> 47:17.973
Yeah, I deleted it.
I told you I deleted it.

47:18.076 --> 47:19.802
So, um...
- Okay, here's the thing.

47:19.906 --> 47:22.563
They don't want to air
two skincare pieces

47:22.667 --> 47:24.393
back-to-back.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:24.496 --> 47:26.222
You said you were gonna
handle this, Brett.

47:26.326 --> 47:30.157
Hope, your reputation isn't
exactly great these days.

47:30.261 --> 47:33.436
Your reputation
has never been great.

47:33.540 --> 47:34.990
Speaking of,

47:35.093 --> 47:38.372
about that generous deal
you offered me the other night,

47:38.476 --> 47:39.995
is that how you book
all your guests, or...

47:40.098 --> 47:42.790
No. Hope, you better
have deleted that, okay?

47:42.894 --> 47:45.345
Recording people
against their will is a crime.

47:45.448 --> 47:47.657
I told you this.
It was an accident, Brett.

47:47.761 --> 47:49.142
And I deleted it.

47:49.245 --> 47:51.385
I mean, God,
why are you being so paranoid?

47:51.489 --> 47:53.974
Listen, I'm on my way
to a meeting right now

47:54.078 --> 47:55.286
with one of the biggest
beauty websites in the world.

47:55.389 --> 47:57.805
And they love my products.
Love.

47:57.909 --> 47:59.531
And you're gonna look like fools

47:59.635 --> 48:01.085
if you don't air
my segment soon.

48:01.188 --> 48:03.328
You know, I should
just call your producers myself

48:03.432 --> 48:05.123
and tell them
about the hacking and e-mails...

48:05.227 --> 48:07.160
- No, no, don't just...
- I'm sorry, what?

48:07.263 --> 48:09.887
- I'll work on it.
- Oh, you will. Oh, great.

48:09.990 --> 48:12.613
Thank you so much, Brett.
Brett, you're the best.

48:12.855 --> 48:14.650
Bye. Oh, God.

48:19.724 --> 48:21.139
Margaret.

48:21.243 --> 48:24.280
- Hope.
- So great to see you.

48:24.384 --> 48:25.730
Thank you so much
for meeting me.

48:25.833 --> 48:27.766
- Of course.
- I will keep this brief.

48:27.870 --> 48:29.320
I know how busy you are.
- Oh.

48:29.423 --> 48:31.874
Um, first, I want to apologize
for what happened.

48:31.978 --> 48:34.290
That was...
- Yeah. Who was that guy?

48:34.394 --> 48:36.741
Someone is trying
to sabotage me.

48:36.844 --> 48:39.709
Um, but the good news is,
I just found out

48:39.813 --> 48:41.470
that my segment
on "Brett & Kylie"

48:41.573 --> 48:44.093
is gonna air next week,
even closer to launch.

48:44.197 --> 48:45.784
- That's great.
- Yes!

48:45.888 --> 48:50.375
And here's what I'm thinking.
I want to do an exclusive

48:50.479 --> 48:53.309
online launch with you
and "Under The Skin."

48:53.413 --> 48:55.587
I just need a small advance
so that we--

48:55.691 --> 48:58.142
Hope, um, listen...

48:58.245 --> 49:01.145
unfortunately,
the site is just--

49:01.248 --> 49:03.837
it's booked
for the next few months.

49:03.941 --> 49:06.771
Yeah, I just found out.

49:06.874 --> 49:10.430
- Okay.
- Yeah.

49:10.533 --> 49:11.845
Um...

49:11.949 --> 49:14.399
Okay.

49:14.503 --> 49:18.196
It's just we-- I felt like
we had a plan for...

49:18.300 --> 49:19.887
- I know, I know.
- ...putting the products on...

49:19.991 --> 49:24.478
You know what? I've got to run.
I have this lunch meeting.

49:24.582 --> 49:27.447
When this clears up,
I will get back in touch.

49:27.550 --> 49:30.622
- Okay. Alright.
- Good to see you.

49:30.726 --> 49:32.659
Yeah, Thanks.
Thank you.

49:50.608 --> 49:52.782
Hope, Jeff came by,
looking for you.

49:52.886 --> 49:55.268
Did you tell him
you had the money?

49:55.371 --> 50:00.652
Okay, I can do $1,500
for, like, all of it.

50:00.756 --> 50:05.105
$1,500? Are you joking?
This is great stuff.

50:05.209 --> 50:07.349
This is designer--
all designer.

50:07.452 --> 50:08.971
Uh...

50:09.075 --> 50:13.010
- How old are you? 27?
- Yeah. How did you...

50:13.113 --> 50:15.564
Okay, you seem
like a nice girl.

50:15.667 --> 50:17.738
I'm gonna throw in
my products for you.

50:17.842 --> 50:20.189
I got a serum and a moisturizer.

50:20.293 --> 50:24.883
This is great stuff,
made in Italy.

50:24.987 --> 50:29.336
Okay, I can do $1,750, but
that's, like, the best I can do.

50:29.440 --> 50:31.856
Fine.

50:31.959 --> 50:33.823
That's good. I'll take it.

50:33.927 --> 50:36.033
Okay.

50:48.735 --> 50:51.393
Okay.

50:51.496 --> 50:55.397
Nice doing business
with you.

50:55.500 --> 50:56.708
Mm-hmm.

51:49.761 --> 51:51.384
Hey, babe, it's Colleen.

51:51.487 --> 51:54.732
Um, I'm just calling to cancel
our facial next Thursday.

51:54.835 --> 51:56.043
I'm gonna be out of town.

51:56.147 --> 51:57.942
By the way, I tried
to watch you

51:58.045 --> 51:59.461
on "Brett & Kylie"
the other day,

51:59.564 --> 52:03.016
but they had some other guy,
called Angel, on.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.742
Turns out,
he's right next to you.

52:04.845 --> 52:06.261
It's weird.

52:06.364 --> 52:09.022
Anyway, um,
I'll talk to you soon.

52:10.644 --> 52:13.647
Hey, Hope, it's Jeff.
I, uh-- I came by today.

52:13.751 --> 52:16.271
You weren't around.
I need the rent, Hope.

52:16.374 --> 52:17.927
Okay?
This can't wait any longer.

52:18.031 --> 52:20.792
Alright? Please call me.

52:20.896 --> 52:23.416
Hi.

52:23.519 --> 52:26.281
I'm calling
in response to the ad

52:26.384 --> 52:29.215
"Kooky dumb seeks
serious submissive."

52:29.318 --> 52:32.528
Margaret.

52:32.632 --> 52:35.600
Call me back.
I'm already hard.

52:35.704 --> 52:38.016
Hey, Hope, it's Armen.

52:38.120 --> 52:40.709
Just checking in to see
how your tires are holding up

52:40.812 --> 52:44.575
and how you're doing.
You know, I'm at the shop

52:44.678 --> 52:47.716
if you need anything,
so just be safe.

52:59.624 --> 53:02.420
Jeff! Jeff!

53:02.524 --> 53:04.767
Jeff!

53:04.871 --> 53:08.288
Jeff, It's Angel.
He-- He's trying to ruin me.

53:08.392 --> 53:11.395
Angel Vergara.
He is trying to destroy me.

53:11.498 --> 53:13.086
He is harassing me.

53:13.190 --> 53:14.605
He's posting things about me
on the Internet.

53:14.708 --> 53:16.572
He-- He had me followed,
Jeff.

53:16.676 --> 53:19.920
Now, can you please send some
officers over to arrest him?

53:20.024 --> 53:21.439
Maybe you should worry less

53:21.543 --> 53:23.061
about what's going on
across the lot

53:23.165 --> 53:25.616
and more about why
you told me a week ago

53:25.719 --> 53:27.273
that you would pay rent
on Monday or Tuesday.

53:27.376 --> 53:29.344
He is obviously threatened
by me.

53:29.447 --> 53:31.000
He's trying to take over
this entire plaza.

53:31.104 --> 53:32.450
- Shh, shh.
- Look, you've had

53:32.554 --> 53:34.245
a great run here,
but we are exploring

53:34.349 --> 53:35.867
a lot of opportunities
with the property.

53:35.971 --> 53:37.421
What?

53:37.524 --> 53:41.390
You know, I poured
everything I had into my line.

53:41.494 --> 53:44.393
Now, the only thing
I have left in this world,

53:44.497 --> 53:46.568
I'm in danger of losing.
- I still don't think

53:46.671 --> 53:48.225
that any of this
is life-threatening.

53:48.328 --> 53:49.847
Maybe it's because
it's not your life.

53:49.950 --> 53:52.712
Because it's my life,
and I feel very threatened!

53:52.815 --> 53:54.300
Angel mentioned to me

53:54.403 --> 53:56.543
that you have been antagonizing
some of his clients.

53:56.647 --> 54:00.547
That's my client, Jeff!
She's my fucking client, Jeff!

54:00.651 --> 54:02.411
Hope Goldman,
unless you can prove to me

54:02.515 --> 54:04.517
this person is willfully and
repeatedly harassing you,

54:04.620 --> 54:07.451
I'm not sure that we should be
of any help at this time.

54:07.554 --> 54:10.488
Jeff, I need you to listen!

54:10.592 --> 54:13.595
Hey, do I have to prove this
to you?

54:13.698 --> 54:15.217
Huh?

54:17.219 --> 54:20.326
You won't be happy
till I'm dead!

It's in our DNA.
It is how we were built.

59:39.230 --> 59:41.543
But I look around me,
and I see a lot of people

59:41.647 --> 59:42.855
who have lost sight
of who they are--

59:42.958 --> 59:44.684
right?-- people
who have become sheep,

59:44.788 --> 59:46.583
people
who let themselves be prey.

59:46.686 --> 59:47.998
They go, "Oh,
I don't know what to do today.

59:48.101 --> 59:49.689
I guess I'm gonna
wait for the shepherd."

59:49.793 --> 59:51.518
What I want to focus on today
is remembering

59:51.622 --> 59:53.486
that no matter what happens,

59:53.590 --> 59:58.146
if you can focus
on who you are at your core,

59:58.249 --> 01:00:01.080

You want to be a fucking lion.

01:00:16.992 --> 01:00:18.407
When you wake up
tomorrow morning,

01:00:18.511 --> 01:00:19.892
take control of your life.

01:00:19.995 --> 01:00:21.618
I'm serious. You can connect.

01:00:21.721 --> 01:00:24.413
You can not only connect,
but you can transcend.

01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:29.177
Where's the money?

01:00:32.594 --> 01:00:34.700
"Where's the money?"

01:00:34.803 --> 01:00:36.322
"Where's the money?"
- Come on, man,

01:00:36.425 --> 01:00:39.152
I didn't know she'd have mace.
- Yeah, neither did I.

01:00:39.256 --> 01:00:40.429
Sounds like you did good, though.

01:00:40.533 --> 01:00:43.432
You did good, man.
- Thanks.

01:00:43.536 --> 01:00:46.366
I worked on it in class.
- Okay.

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:48.368
- You still acting?
- No, no, no, no.

01:00:48.472 --> 01:00:50.681
I, uh, did a couple auditions
after I got out,

01:00:50.785 --> 01:00:52.476
but, uh, I needed something
more meaningful.

01:00:52.579 --> 01:00:55.237
So that's what I'm doing
the whole life-coaching gig.

01:00:55.341 --> 01:00:57.964
It's fucking taking off.
- That sounds cool.

01:00:58.068 --> 01:01:00.967
Yeah. I might need you guys
for another thing soon.

01:01:01.071 --> 01:01:03.349
I could even pay you
in life-coaching sessions,

01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:05.144
if you prefer.
- Uh...

01:01:05.247 --> 01:01:07.456
I'm good with the cash.
- Yeah?

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.527
You're...

01:01:12.289 --> 01:01:15.430
Yeah.

01:01:15.533 --> 01:01:18.916
Um, so, uh...

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.987
Well, what you doing now?

01:01:21.091 --> 01:01:22.748
I was just in the middle
of something, so...

01:01:22.851 --> 01:01:24.646
Alright. Yeah.

01:01:24.750 --> 01:01:26.648
See ya.
- I'll hit you guys up soon.

01:01:26.752 --> 01:01:28.339
Thank you so much, brother.

01:01:30.928 --> 01:01:33.517
How do we find
the elevator to the next level?

01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:35.484
It's a great question.

01:01:35.588 --> 01:01:37.970
We keep our eyes open,

01:01:38.073 --> 01:01:40.317
and we are ready for it
when it appears.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:44.977
Sometimes you have to
start a fire to put it out.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.981
You have to create a situation
to be the hero,

01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:52.398
to be the best version
of yourself.

01:01:52.501 --> 01:01:55.850
Success is not an accident.

01:01:55.953 --> 01:01:59.094
You have to
fucking get after it.

01:01:59.198 --> 01:02:03.202
We need him gone.
He's getting away with it.

01:02:03.305 --> 01:02:06.826
The cops aren't doing shit,
and I-I'm feeling...

01:02:06.930 --> 01:02:08.794
I have-- I'm--
I'm out of options.

01:02:08.897 --> 01:02:10.865
I have-- I have no options.
- It's fucked.

01:02:10.968 --> 01:02:12.280
I mean, it's...
- It's so fucked.

01:02:12.383 --> 01:02:13.937
It's undeniably fucked.
I don't-- I'm like--

01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:17.147
Okay, but, Hope, what if
I moved into the studio?

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:20.012
- What?
- Just until this blows over.

01:02:20.115 --> 01:02:21.634
I mean, wouldn't it
make you feel safer

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.118
having somebody
with my skill set around?

01:02:23.222 --> 01:02:26.363
- I guess that's true.
- Think about it.

01:02:26.466 --> 01:02:28.675
I could have my own space
where I work with clients

01:02:28.779 --> 01:02:31.678
and I help with your rebranding
in a more official capacity.

01:02:31.782 --> 01:02:33.059
- Um...
- I could really help

01:02:33.163 --> 01:02:34.785
and make you feel
a little bit safer.

01:02:34.889 --> 01:02:36.442
Also--
- What are you talking about?

01:02:36.545 --> 01:02:39.203
Jordan, what about Angel?

01:02:39.307 --> 01:02:42.448
Angel won't stop
until somebody talks to him.

01:02:42.551 --> 01:02:44.036
Exactly. Who is gonna do that?

01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:46.866
Why don't you
let me deal with it?

01:02:49.938 --> 01:02:55.392
- You would do that?
- Of course.

01:02:55.495 --> 01:02:57.566
Okay. Okay.

01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:59.776
Been trying to get you
to let me do this for a while.

01:03:02.882 --> 01:03:05.229
I'll call you, okay?
- Okay. Call me after.

01:03:09.337 --> 01:03:11.960
That's fine, just leave it
there for 5 minutes,

01:03:12.064 --> 01:03:13.720
and don't touch your face, please.

01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:15.757
I'll be back.
Hey, there.

01:03:15.861 --> 01:03:18.691
- Hey, man.
- How can we help you?

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:22.143
Well, I wanted to talk with you
for a moment about, uh...

01:03:24.559 --> 01:03:26.733
Is there actually somewhere
more private that we could--

01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:28.563
we could speak?
- Sorry to interrupt, Angel.

01:03:28.666 --> 01:03:30.427
- Yeah.
- I want to confirm

01:03:30.530 --> 01:03:33.292
the filming for next week.
- Uh, which show is that?

01:03:33.395 --> 01:03:35.225
The one we're shooting is
the one in New York.

01:03:35.328 --> 01:03:38.055
I think I can do it
on Thursday morning,

01:03:38.159 --> 01:03:40.609
but we need to check
the flights for New York.

01:03:40.713 --> 01:03:41.818
Okay.

01:03:54.037 --> 01:03:56.349
Sorry.
When it rains, it pours.

01:03:58.351 --> 01:04:02.355
Fuck, man,
you are blowing up.

01:04:02.459 --> 01:04:04.288
Thank you.

01:04:04.392 --> 01:04:07.257
You were saying?

01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:11.571
My name is Jordan Weaver,
and I'm a life coach, right?

01:04:11.675 --> 01:04:12.987
Uh-huh.

01:04:13.090 --> 01:04:14.816
I'm extremely proficient
in martial arts,

01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:16.162
so my work is all about

01:04:16.266 --> 01:04:19.096
combining the mental
with the physical.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:20.995
I wanted to discuss
potential partnership

01:04:21.098 --> 01:04:25.482
where I could offer
my services to your VIP clients.

01:04:25.585 --> 01:04:28.243
Listen, I think that we could be
very helpful to one another.

01:04:28.347 --> 01:04:30.142
What sort of help do you need
around here?

01:04:30.245 --> 01:04:31.902
Here is my card.
- I don't need any help.

01:04:32.006 --> 01:04:34.767
And I don't know who you are.
- I'm a life coach.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.286
Yeah, I don't care.

01:04:36.389 --> 01:04:39.047
You need to leave.

01:04:39.151 --> 01:04:41.670
Now.
- Sure. Perfect.

01:04:48.194 --> 01:04:51.473
Stupid little fuck.

01:04:54.062 --> 01:04:56.030
Hey, Hope.

01:04:56.133 --> 01:04:57.997
Yeah, it's all taken care of.
It's over.

01:04:58.101 --> 01:04:59.619
Now he's not gonna be
a problem anymore.

01:04:59.723 --> 01:05:01.173
Oh, relax.

01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:03.106
He's not gonna be
a fucking problem anymore, okay?

01:05:03.209 --> 01:05:06.040
No. Hey, hey, hey, Hope.
Yeah, it's all taken care of.

01:05:06.143 --> 01:05:08.628
Shouldn't be
a fucking problem anymore.

01:05:08.732 --> 01:05:09.975
Yeah, should have
fucking seen him.

01:05:10.078 --> 01:05:11.838
Fucking embarrassment,
fucking...

01:05:15.981 --> 01:05:17.706
What happened?

01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:19.432
What did he say? What happened?

01:05:19.536 --> 01:05:22.435
- I took care of it. It's over.
- Oh, my God! Really?!

01:05:22.539 --> 01:05:23.920
You're incredible.
He admitted it?

01:05:24.023 --> 01:05:25.335
He admitted to it?

01:05:25.438 --> 01:05:27.095
He is not gonna be
a problem anymore.

01:05:27.199 --> 01:05:29.201
Everything is fine.
I've just got a little work

01:05:29.304 --> 01:05:31.306
to finish up here,
and then I will come over

01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:32.583
in a few
and tell you everything.

01:05:32.687 --> 01:05:36.035
Oh! Oh, God! Okay.

01:05:36.139 --> 01:05:38.796
Hope you have champagne.

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:42.904
Oh! Okay. Okay.
I'll see you soon.

01:05:43.008 --> 01:05:46.080
Okay. Alright.

01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:54.277
Hey! Get out of my house!

01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:57.728
Get out!

01:08:11.535 --> 01:08:14.159
Hope?
I'm so glad you called.

01:08:14.262 --> 01:08:15.919
I was-- I just--
- Listen to me!

01:08:16.022 --> 01:08:17.472
I was fucking attacked.

01:08:17.576 --> 01:08:19.302
You told me you took care of it!
- What?

01:08:19.405 --> 01:08:21.442
What are you talking about?
Well, Hope, slow down.

01:08:21.545 --> 01:08:23.685
Don't fucking tell me
to slow down, okay?!

01:08:23.789 --> 01:08:25.446
That's impossible.
That doesn't--

01:08:25.549 --> 01:08:26.930
That doesn't make any sense.
- You said this was over,

01:08:27.033 --> 01:08:28.380
but all you did
was make it worse!

01:08:28.483 --> 01:08:30.934
This has gone too far!
- What do you mean,

01:08:31.037 --> 01:08:33.074
he attacked you?
I-I literally handled it.

01:08:33.178 --> 01:08:36.077
You didn't fucking handle it,
obviously!

01:08:36.181 --> 01:08:37.527
If you fucking handled it,

01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:39.425
then why is Angel's guy
in my house?!

01:08:39.529 --> 01:08:42.014
I don't know, Hope.
Just don't worry.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.567
Everything's gon--
It's gonna be okay.

01:08:43.671 --> 01:08:45.051
I'm gonna come over,
and we'll figure this out.

01:08:45.155 --> 01:08:46.915
Alright?
- Do not come over.

01:08:47.019 --> 01:08:51.506
Just stay the fuck out of it.
I'm gonna handle it myself.

01:08:51.610 --> 01:08:52.783
I don't need you.
- Why? W-W-Wait.

01:08:59.859 --> 01:09:03.208
He's trying to intimidate me
by sending me these videos.

01:09:03.311 --> 01:09:04.519
This is disgusting.

01:09:04.623 --> 01:09:06.625
And then this guy
is in my house.

01:09:06.728 --> 01:09:08.420
I just--
I don't know what to do.

01:09:08.523 --> 01:09:11.112
Hey, hey, you did the right
thing by calling, okay?

01:09:11.216 --> 01:09:13.356
Listen, I want to be clear
about one thing.

01:09:13.459 --> 01:09:16.669
I don't want you talking
to anybody about this anymore.

01:09:16.773 --> 01:09:19.016
Okay?

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.777
I got it.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.020
Don't talk to anybody
about this anymore.

01:09:23.124 --> 01:09:24.677
You hear me?

01:09:24.781 --> 01:09:26.472
Nothing bad is gonna happen
now that I'm involved, alright?

01:09:26.576 --> 01:09:30.373
I'm gonna take care
of everything, okay?

01:09:30.476 --> 01:09:32.029
Um...

01:09:32.133 --> 01:09:33.548
But I don't want anyone
to get hurt.

01:09:33.652 --> 01:09:35.964
Oh, no.
No one's gonna get hurt.

01:09:36.068 --> 01:09:39.036
The most important thing is that
this guy, this guy right here,

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:41.798
is not gonna fucking
bother you anymore.

01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:46.043
Um...

01:09:46.147 --> 01:09:50.565
Hey, uh, I-- I want you
to have this.

01:09:50.669 --> 01:09:53.327
Um...

01:09:53.430 --> 01:09:55.984
- It's moisturizer.
- Yeah, we--

01:09:56.088 --> 01:09:58.263
we got about a thousand of these
in the back, remember?

01:09:58.366 --> 01:09:59.402
Yeah, it's...

01:09:59.505 --> 01:10:03.164
But this one's... just for you.

01:10:03.268 --> 01:10:04.855
Okay.

01:10:04.959 --> 01:10:05.994
Alright.

01:10:06.098 --> 01:10:08.342
Come by in a few days.

01:10:08.445 --> 01:10:10.447
This will all be
a distant memory, Hope.

01:10:10.551 --> 01:10:13.554
Thank you, Armen.

01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:29.086
♪ All my life

01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:34.022
♪ Girl, I've been mistreated

01:10:34.126 --> 01:10:41.961
♪ You will never look my way

01:10:45.517 --> 01:10:47.450
Well, you're in a good mood
today.

01:10:47.553 --> 01:10:49.900
Am I?

01:10:50.004 --> 01:10:51.316
Oh.
It's just Jordan again.

01:10:51.419 --> 01:10:52.593
Should I tell him
you're not here?

01:10:52.696 --> 01:10:54.457
- Oh, yeah. Just ignore it.
- Oh.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.390
He told me
you guys got in a fight,

01:10:56.493 --> 01:10:59.945
but he sent this package to you.

01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:02.154
You can open it.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:04.156
Hmm.

01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.262
Ooh!

01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:09.989
Well, that was nice of him.

01:11:10.093 --> 01:11:11.784
This will look good on
the back wall, don't you think?

01:11:13.993 --> 01:11:17.031
No, I'll just bring it home.

01:11:25.488 --> 01:11:28.801
- Hope.
- Hmm?

01:11:28.905 --> 01:11:30.803
I'm worried about you.

01:11:30.907 --> 01:11:32.288
Oh, I'm fine.

01:11:32.391 --> 01:11:34.462
Seriously, I need you
to keep it together.

01:11:34.566 --> 01:11:36.257
I can't have you falling apart
right now.

01:11:36.361 --> 01:11:40.468
We're way too close.
- Oh. I know we're close.

01:11:40.572 --> 01:11:44.438
No, I mean, we're close to
everything we've worked towards.

01:11:44.541 --> 01:11:46.198
I'm here
because I believe in this

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:47.820
and I believe in you.

01:11:47.924 --> 01:11:50.064
I've spent my whole career
working around your dream.

01:11:50.167 --> 01:11:52.169
Well, now it's my dream, too.
- Oh, honey, honey.

01:11:52.273 --> 01:11:54.517
I know, I-- I know.
Thank you.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:56.312
- No, I...
- I know.

01:11:56.415 --> 01:11:59.901
Do not mess this up
for yourself.

01:12:00.005 --> 01:12:01.109
Do you understand?

01:12:01.213 --> 01:12:03.698
I'm not gonna mess this up.

01:12:03.802 --> 01:12:05.562
I promise.

01:12:11.706 --> 01:12:12.845
Hello.

01:12:12.949 --> 01:12:14.813
Miss Goldman,
this is Detective Emerson

01:12:14.916 --> 01:12:16.297
at the
Hollywood Police Department.

01:12:16.401 --> 01:12:18.264
Are you at your office
right now?

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:19.990
Uh-huh, I am.

01:12:20.094 --> 01:12:23.477
I'll be there in 5 minutes.
Meet me in the parking lot.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:27.239
Are you coming to arrest Angel?

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.965
Meet me in the lot.

01:12:29.068 --> 01:12:31.001
Miss Goldman!

01:12:33.314 --> 01:12:35.143
Over here, please.

01:12:35.247 --> 01:12:38.492
Uh, what is this about?

01:12:38.595 --> 01:12:39.976
I just want to
show you something.

01:12:40.079 --> 01:12:41.633
It's just, I'm--
You know, I'm really busy.

01:12:41.736 --> 01:12:46.638
I need you to see this,
and I'm not asking.

01:12:46.741 --> 01:12:48.640
Please.

01:12:48.743 --> 01:12:50.227
Okay.

01:12:56.441 --> 01:12:58.443
Sorry. What is this?
What am I looking at?

01:12:58.546 --> 01:13:00.514
This is, um, footage
from the security camera.

01:13:00.617 --> 01:13:03.240
W-What secur-- Where?
What security camera?

01:13:03.344 --> 01:13:05.104
Right up there.

01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:11.456
Okay, we can find the spot.

01:13:13.285 --> 01:13:15.252
Right there. See that guy?

01:13:15.356 --> 01:13:17.151
That guy?

01:13:17.254 --> 01:13:21.189
He is tying his shoe.

01:13:21.293 --> 01:13:23.468
- Oh. Yeah.
- Hang on.

01:13:25.815 --> 01:13:27.748
There.

01:13:36.998 --> 01:13:39.207
So?

01:13:39.311 --> 01:13:40.864
Anyone you know?

01:13:40.968 --> 01:13:43.108
That neighbor
you were telling me about?

01:13:46.732 --> 01:13:50.356
No, no, it's-- That's not him.

01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.289
Yeah, I didn't think so.

01:13:52.393 --> 01:13:53.808
Uh, we're gonna
circulate this photo

01:13:53.912 --> 01:13:55.465
around the neighborhood,
and I'll let you know

01:13:55.569 --> 01:13:56.639
if anything comes up.
- That's good, yeah.

01:13:56.742 --> 01:13:59.435
Good. Okay.
Thank you again.

01:13:59.538 --> 01:14:01.022
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I'm just so busy, so...

01:14:01.126 --> 01:14:02.852
Alright, if I hear anything,
I'll let you know.

01:14:02.955 --> 01:14:04.405
Yep.

01:14:14.001 --> 01:14:15.174
Hey, it's Jordan.

01:14:15.278 --> 01:14:17.349
Today it can be
whatever you want it to be.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.455
Leave a message.

01:14:21.008 --> 01:14:23.838
Jordan, pick up
my fucking calls, goddamn it!

01:14:23.942 --> 01:14:27.497
I know you're fucking there.
I know you are.

01:14:27.601 --> 01:14:30.500
Call me back. You owe me.

01:14:30.604 --> 01:14:33.123
Call me back!

01:14:42.857 --> 01:14:45.066
- What's up, brother?
- What's up, man?

01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:46.792
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

01:14:46.896 --> 01:14:48.725
I need you for that thing
that I was telling you about.

01:14:48.829 --> 01:14:50.486
Okay? And your buddy?
- Chris?

01:14:50.589 --> 01:14:52.660
- Yes. Yes, exactly.
- What do you want us to do?

01:14:52.764 --> 01:14:56.319
Just like last time,
but this time, bigger, okay?

01:14:56.422 --> 01:14:59.391
Her house,
day after tomorrow, 5:45.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.566
I show up at 6:00,
save the fucking day.

01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:03.499
And then you guys
are out of there

01:15:03.602 --> 01:15:04.914
before anything bad happens, okay?

01:15:05.017 --> 01:15:06.881
Here's the address right there.

01:15:06.985 --> 01:15:09.470
Is it more of that
life-coaching stuff?

01:15:09.574 --> 01:15:12.300
Fuck yeah, man.
It's getting fucking huge.

01:15:19.411 --> 01:15:22.483
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

01:15:25.417 --> 01:15:28.006
It's Armen.

01:15:28.109 --> 01:15:30.905
Armen, hey, it's Hope again.
I've called you four times.

01:15:31.009 --> 01:15:33.667
Where are you?
Um, listen, I--

01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:36.739
I need you
to just forget about that thing

01:15:36.842 --> 01:15:39.086
that we talked about, right?
You can just forget about it.

01:15:39.189 --> 01:15:40.570
I-I'm okay.
Um...

01:15:40.674 --> 01:15:43.987
stay where you are,
and please call me back.

01:16:01.315 --> 01:16:04.594
- Angel Vergara?
- Yeah. How can I help you?

01:16:04.698 --> 01:16:06.700
Oh! No, please, please,
take whatever you want!

01:16:06.803 --> 01:16:08.080
- You know who Hope Goldman is?
- What?!

01:16:08.184 --> 01:16:09.495
Hope Goldman!
You know who she is?!

01:16:09.599 --> 01:16:10.773
Yes, I know who she is,

01:16:10.876 --> 01:16:12.050
but I don't give a fuck
about her.

01:16:12.153 --> 01:16:13.741
No! Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Oh!

01:16:13.845 --> 01:16:18.090
You fucking go near her again,
I swear to God,

01:16:18.194 --> 01:16:19.782
I'll fucking kill-- Oh!

01:17:51.528 --> 01:17:53.599
Oh, fuck.

01:18:30.671 --> 01:18:33.501
- Hey, can I call you right--
- Where have you been?

01:18:33.605 --> 01:18:35.987
Uh, I'm just leaving a meeting.

01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:37.471
Why haven't you answered
my calls?

01:18:37.574 --> 01:18:39.024
I tried you all night.
- I didn't get any calls

01:18:39.128 --> 01:18:40.888
from you.
- You need to come to see me.

01:18:40.992 --> 01:18:43.063
Come-- Come to my office.
- What about tomorrow night?

01:18:43.166 --> 01:18:45.928
Maybe, like 6:00, your house?
- No, no, now!

01:18:46.031 --> 01:18:48.585
Now.
Everything is fucked.

01:18:48.689 --> 01:18:50.622
What do you-- what do you
mean, everything's fucked?

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:53.038
I mean, I need to see you
in person, okay?

01:18:53.142 --> 01:18:55.592
I mean, something bad
happened to Angel.

01:18:55.696 --> 01:18:57.249
Okay?
- Okay, what happened?

01:18:57.353 --> 01:19:00.011
What happened to Angel?
- It's come way out of hand.

01:19:00.114 --> 01:19:02.807
Okay, so, I need you
to come see me in person.

01:19:04.429 --> 01:19:07.087
Hello? Jordan?
Jordan!

01:19:07.190 --> 01:19:09.503
Oh.

01:19:16.337 --> 01:19:18.443
Oh.

01:19:38.394 --> 01:19:40.534
Aw, it's okay.

01:19:47.575 --> 01:19:49.025
- Hollywood Police Department.
- Hi. Hello.

01:19:49.129 --> 01:19:51.027
Um, I would like
to make an anonymous tip

01:19:51.131 --> 01:19:52.960
about a crime
I believe has been committed.

01:19:53.064 --> 01:19:56.343
Hope Goldman of
Hope Goldman Skincare--

01:19:56.446 --> 01:19:59.173
she's been targeting
and stalking her neighbor,

01:19:59.277 --> 01:20:02.211
Angel Vergara,
and acting very erratically.

01:20:02.314 --> 01:20:04.109
I just think something bad
might have happened,

01:20:04.213 --> 01:20:05.731
and I want to see
anybody get hurt.

01:20:05.835 --> 01:20:07.733
Thank you.

01:20:14.844 --> 01:20:16.915
Hello.
Hope Goldman Skincare.

01:20:17.019 --> 01:20:18.848
How can I help you?

01:20:18.952 --> 01:20:22.058
What? When?

01:20:24.164 --> 01:20:25.648
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

01:20:25.751 --> 01:20:29.272
Thank you for calling.

01:20:32.413 --> 01:20:35.934
Hope? That was Anto.

01:20:36.038 --> 01:20:39.731
Armen was killed last night.

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:41.975
He was in a car accident.

01:20:42.078 --> 01:20:44.563
Cancel all my appointments.

01:20:44.667 --> 01:20:46.117
Yeah, I-I don't feel well.

01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.188
I got to go home.
- Okay.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:54.332
Just stay there.

01:20:56.748 --> 01:21:01.063
- Are you Hope Goldman?
- Uh, yeah.

01:21:01.166 --> 01:21:04.860
What's, uh-- What's, uh--
Did something happen?

01:21:04.963 --> 01:21:05.964
We're letting the neighbors
know

01:21:06.068 --> 01:21:07.379
there's an active investigation.

01:21:07.483 --> 01:21:09.795
Angel Vergara was attacked
last night.

01:21:09.899 --> 01:21:11.452
At the moment,
he's in the hospital

01:21:11.556 --> 01:21:14.317
in critical condition.
We don't know at this time

01:21:14.421 --> 01:21:16.457
whether it was random
or if he was a target.

01:21:16.561 --> 01:21:18.908
Okay.

01:21:19.012 --> 01:21:22.187
I'm-- I'm sorry.
You must know him.

01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:24.949
Yeah. Yeah.

01:21:25.052 --> 01:21:29.229
Yes, he's a great guy.

01:21:31.196 --> 01:21:32.957
He's a great guy.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:36.305
Um, thank you.
- We'll be in touch.

01:21:36.408 --> 01:21:37.685
Okay.

01:21:41.758 --> 01:21:44.692
Hope, what's going on?

01:21:44.796 --> 01:21:47.005
Hope?

01:21:52.838 --> 01:21:55.841
Jordan.

01:21:55.945 --> 01:21:58.983
This is all his fault.

01:22:01.123 --> 01:22:03.677
It is?
Yeah.

01:22:05.886 --> 01:22:09.062
Nobody even knows
where he lives.

01:22:09.165 --> 01:22:12.755
Maybe Colleen?
Maybe we can find him.

01:22:15.965 --> 01:22:19.624
Um, Hope?

01:22:19.727 --> 01:22:22.282
I know where he lives.

01:22:26.044 --> 01:22:28.184
Marine?

01:22:31.153 --> 01:22:34.156
I'm sorry.
Am I fired?

01:22:34.259 --> 01:22:36.330
Where does he live?

01:23:54.098 --> 01:23:56.479
Hope! Oh, my God.

01:23:56.583 --> 01:23:58.999
Thank God you're here.
- You fucked me.

01:23:59.103 --> 01:24:00.173
What-- What are you
talking about?

01:24:00.276 --> 01:24:01.657
Hey.
- Don't come closer!

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.038
Stay right the fuck there.

01:24:03.141 --> 01:24:04.418
Hope, I need to tell
you something.

01:24:04.522 --> 01:24:05.868
I know things have gotten
so crazy.

01:24:05.971 --> 01:24:06.938
- Shut the fuck up.
- Okay, no, Hope,

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.353
I'm in love with you.

01:24:08.457 --> 01:24:10.286
- Fuck you, Jordan!
- You know, that's why

01:24:10.390 --> 01:24:12.012
I've gotten involved
in all of this, okay?!

01:24:12.116 --> 01:24:14.187
And now Angel
is fucking after me.

01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:17.190
Angel is in the hospital,
in critical condition!

01:24:17.293 --> 01:24:20.020
- What?
- How fucking stupid are you,

01:24:20.124 --> 01:24:23.575
getting caught on camera,
slashing my tires?!

01:24:23.679 --> 01:24:25.301
I don't know what you did,
Hope.

01:24:25.405 --> 01:24:27.234
Get the fuck out of here.
Oh, Jesus!

01:24:27.338 --> 01:24:30.134
- Oh!
- Fucking damn...

01:24:30.237 --> 01:24:32.170
What do you want from me?!

01:24:32.274 --> 01:24:34.759
You want money?!
I don't have any!

01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:36.036
You asked me to do this!

01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:37.451
You said
that you needed my help!

01:24:37.555 --> 01:24:39.591
Did you conveniently
forget about all that?!

01:24:39.695 --> 01:24:41.697
Huh? Fuck!

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:43.319
How could I be so stupid?

01:24:43.423 --> 01:24:46.460
Because you are
a dumb, pathetic bitch

01:24:46.564 --> 01:24:49.118
who only cares about herself,
constantly complaining

01:24:49.222 --> 01:24:51.845
about-- Oh!
Fuck! Ow!

01:24:51.948 --> 01:24:54.848
Ow! Fucking bitch!

01:25:01.820 --> 01:25:05.100
Oh, fuck.

01:26:08.784 --> 01:26:10.889
Hope Goldman,
this is the police!

01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:24.869
Come out with your hands up!

01:26:28.493 --> 01:26:31.841
I'm coming!
- Open the door!

01:26:36.329 --> 01:26:38.676
I'm coming!

01:26:41.230 --> 01:26:43.888
Coming in!

01:27:04.149 --> 01:27:06.876
Look! Over here!
Over here!

01:27:06.980 --> 01:27:10.121
Okay, over here!

01:27:10.225 --> 01:27:13.297
- We spoke to your friend Jordan.
- Friend?

01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.265
I barely know that guy.
I've spoken 15 words to him.

01:27:16.369 --> 01:27:17.818
You know, he's stalking me.

01:27:17.922 --> 01:27:19.786
He met me on a photo shoot
three years ago,

01:27:19.889 --> 01:27:21.719
and he's been in love with me
ever since.

01:27:21.822 --> 01:27:23.548
He's the one
who slashed my tires,

01:27:23.652 --> 01:27:24.860
in case
you haven't figured that out.

01:27:24.963 --> 01:27:26.206
And he's been in jail.

01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:27.552
I don't know what he's
capable of,

01:27:27.656 --> 01:27:29.174
but he's done this kind of thing
before.

01:27:29.278 --> 01:27:31.107
Also, can you please
do me a favor

01:27:31.211 --> 01:27:32.350
and-- and you know,
you left--

01:27:32.454 --> 01:27:34.110
don't leave the door open.

01:27:34.214 --> 01:27:37.044
My products are in there, and
they're worth everything to me.

01:27:37.148 --> 01:27:38.770
And they're super nice,
you know?

01:27:38.874 --> 01:27:41.221
So can you just, like, make sure
that they're locked up and safe?

01:27:41.325 --> 01:27:42.981
Yeah, we'll get someone
right on that.

01:27:43.085 --> 01:27:45.018
And you know, if you want to
take a moisturizer, you should.

01:27:45.121 --> 01:27:46.364
All of you, really.

01:27:46.468 --> 01:27:47.572
They're unisex,
and they're amazing.

01:27:47.676 --> 01:27:49.125
You're gonna love them.

01:27:56.616 --> 01:27:59.515
Fuck, man. Jesus Christ, dude.

01:27:59.619 --> 01:28:01.137
Well, okay, okay, okay.

01:28:01.241 --> 01:28:02.587
Everything I did,
she asked me to, okay?

01:28:02.691 --> 01:28:04.244
She asked me to slash
her fucking tires.

01:28:04.348 --> 01:28:05.763
You got the wrong fucking dude, okay?

01:28:05.866 --> 01:28:07.178
She's crazy.

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:09.353
Look what she did
to my fucking face.

01:28:16.739 --> 01:28:19.949
It's open.

01:28:20.053 --> 01:28:23.781
Hello?
Hope Goldman?

01:28:26.473 --> 01:28:28.130
No one's here.

01:28:28.233 --> 01:28:30.201
♪ Thank you

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:33.515

Okay. Thank you.

Fucking asshole.

<i>Mi amor, mi amor.</i>

01:29:01.577 --> 01:29:03.303
Why did Hope Goldman tried
to have you killed?

01:29:03.407 --> 01:29:05.305
Hey, get the fuck out of here.

01:29:05.409 --> 01:29:07.756
- Okay.
- Thank you.

- Are you ready?
- Love you more.

01:29:10.172 --> 01:29:11.794
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:29:11.898 --> 01:29:13.140
Watch me on the monitor.
Make sure I don't shine, okay?

01:29:14.176 --> 01:29:15.384
I'll look out.

01:29:21.735 --> 01:29:25.877
- She deleted it.
- Thank you.

01:29:27.534 --> 01:29:29.053
Coming up, an exclusive

01:29:29.156 --> 01:29:31.642
on the story Brett and I
can't stop talking about.

01:29:31.745 --> 01:29:34.610
Although the exact truth
remains unclear,

01:29:34.714 --> 01:29:37.061
it's safe to say
that the owner

01:29:37.164 --> 01:29:39.650
of the suddenly hottest line of
Italian-made skincare products

01:29:39.753 --> 01:29:42.204
is facing
some serious controversy.

01:29:46.450 --> 01:29:48.728
Hello.

01:29:48.831 --> 01:29:51.247
Oh, I already told you,
that's the last we have of it.

01:29:51.351 --> 01:29:52.801
No, I'm not trying
to argue here.

01:29:52.904 --> 01:29:54.734
I just want you to understand,
the best I can do

01:29:54.837 --> 01:29:57.012
is put you on a wait list
until next season.

01:29:57.115 --> 01:29:59.980
That's right, they're calling
her the killer facialist.

01:30:00.084 --> 01:30:02.880
And with good reason.
And right here,

01:30:02.983 --> 01:30:06.608
we have exclusive footage
of aesthetician Hope Goldman,

01:30:06.711 --> 01:30:10.784
who allegedly hired a hitman
to take out her rival.

01:30:10.888 --> 01:30:13.787
And that exclusive footage
in an interview

01:30:13.891 --> 01:30:16.065
taken by Kylie and me...
- I remember that.

01:30:16.169 --> 01:30:17.722
...just weeks before the crimes

01:30:17.826 --> 01:30:20.345
that rocked
the Hollywood community.

01:30:20.449 --> 01:30:22.934
Pretty dark stuff.
- Yeah.

01:30:23.038 --> 01:30:24.833
Skincare is not just about
how you look.

01:30:24.936 --> 01:30:25.972
Hmm.

01:30:26.075 --> 01:30:28.008
For me,
it's about inner confidence,

01:30:28.112 --> 01:30:32.185
uh, putting the best version
of yourself out into the world.

01:30:32.288 --> 01:30:34.808
I don't even think it's about
the skin you start out with.

01:30:34.912 --> 01:30:37.570
I think it's about
what are you willing to do

01:30:37.673 --> 01:30:39.986
to get to where you want to be.

01:30:40.089 --> 01:30:45.509
It's about taking control
of your life.
