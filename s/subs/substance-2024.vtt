38:52.458 --> 38:53.541
Beautiful and happy.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.500
People want to be happy.

38:56.583 --> 38:56.625

39:10.416 --> 39:11.458
Who has time to say that?

39:12.458 --> 39:13.333
We're gonna make you Cindy.

39:14.041 --> 39:15.750
It's shorter, it's better.

39:17.416 --> 39:18.166
So, I'm gonna let you

39:18.250 --> 39:19.750
organize everything else with Cindy.

39:20.916 --> 39:23.083
Oh, um, before you go,

39:23.500 --> 39:24.541
I just have to mention

39:24.625 --> 39:27.166
a small scheduling issue.

39:28.375 --> 39:32.125
I have to be out of town every other week

39:32.208 --> 39:34.583
to take care of my

39:34.666 --> 39:37.208
mother, who's very sick.

39:40.416 --> 39:44.000

Hmm.

39:58.333 --> 39:59.625

41:00.791 --> 41:02.125

41:07.250 --> 41:10.083
head down, contract.

41:13.708 --> 41:16.666
And five, six, seven, eight, elbows.

I've all been wanting

44:55.500 --> 44:56.666
to have a drink with you

44:56.750 --> 44:57.708
for your departure.

44:58.375 --> 45:02.208
Anyway, we all chipped in

45:02.291 --> 45:05.458
and we got you just a little

45:05.541 --> 45:07.083
something to keep you busy.

45:08.875 --> 45:09.166
It's French.

45:09.708 --> 45:11.458
My wife, she's for her spire.

45:11.541 --> 45:12.458
Oh, I don't want my wife.

45:14.125 --> 45:15.541
Oops, I gotta run.

45:16.250 --> 45:19.500
But it's always great to see you.

49:34.416 --> 49:36.083
God dammit, they have the phone

49:36.291 --> 49:38.125
and it's such a great night.

49:38.750 --> 49:39.375
Open up.

49:40.625 --> 49:43.000
We gotta open up.

49:44.875 --> 49:46.750
And uh, sorry.

49:48.208 --> 49:49.250
I thought that Ms. Sparkle.

49:49.666 --> 49:50.333
She moved out.

49:50.958 --> 49:51.625
I'm the new tenant.

49:53.916 --> 49:54.083
Sue.

49:56.125 --> 49:56.333
Oliver.

49:57.083 --> 49:57.583
Oliver.

49:59.625 --> 49:59.875
Oliver.

49:59.958 --> 50:02.083
You wanted to complain about something?

50:03.375 --> 50:03.750
Oliver?

50:05.333 --> 50:05.583
What?

50:06.541 --> 50:06.916
No.

50:08.333 --> 50:09.625
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

50:10.166 --> 50:11.083
I think it's like

50:11.166 --> 50:12.375

50:12.458 --> 50:12.958
going on in the

I got a sack of tools

50:28.166 --> 50:30.875
and I got a big hammer.

50:34.166 --> 50:34.958
You know what I mean.

50:36.666 --> 50:39.958
(laughing) Anyways, I live right here,

50:40.041 --> 50:41.708
so you know where to find me.

50:41.833 --> 50:42.291
Anytime.

50:43.708 --> 50:44.500
Day or night.

50:45.500 --> 50:45.750
Later.

50:49.708 --> 50:52.333

51:19.708 --> 51:22.333

56:12.166 --> 56:13.083
Don't eat too fast.

59:59.291 --> 01:00:00.416

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:19.625

01:02:36.458 --> 01:02:37.291
Yes, hi.

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:39.708
This is Elizabeth Sparkle.

01:02:43.375 --> 01:02:46.958

Yes.

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:51.666
Yes, hi.

01:02:52.875 --> 01:02:54.375
There's been a slight

01:02:54.458 --> 01:02:56.583
misuse of the substance.

01:02:57.333 --> 01:03:03.041
A few extra hours were accidentally used

01:03:03.958 --> 01:03:05.458
causing an alteration.

01:03:09.166 --> 01:03:09.875
So I'm just looking for

01:03:09.958 --> 01:03:11.166
the procedure to reverse it.

01:03:11.583 --> 01:03:13.000
What has been used on one

01:03:13.083 --> 01:03:15.291
side is lost on the other side.

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:16.791
There's no going back.

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:26.750
No, I don't know what she was thinking.

01:03:27.333 --> 01:03:29.458
And obviously she was drunk.

01:03:29.875 --> 01:03:32.125
Remember there is no she and you.

01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:33.333
You are one.

01:03:34.458 --> 01:03:35.000
Respect the balance

01:03:35.375 --> 01:03:36.083
and you won't have

01:03:36.166 --> 01:03:37.375
any more inconveniences.

01:03:39.083 --> 01:03:41.333
(phone beeping)

01:03:41.416 --> 01:03:45.000
(engine revving)

01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:16.500
(dramatic music)

01:04:16.833 --> 01:04:17.583
Don't you know

01:04:20.541 --> 01:04:21.416
Don't you know

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.916
You got to pump it up

01:04:24.250 --> 01:04:25.083
Don't you know

01:04:27.875 --> 01:04:28.833
Don't you know

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:31.333
You got to pump it up

01:04:32.666 --> 01:04:33.291
You got to pump it up

01:04:37.083 --> 01:04:39.333
You got to pump it up

01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:47.500
You got to pump it up

01:04:49.916 --> 01:04:53.875
You got to pump it up

01:04:53.958 --> 01:05:06.541
(engine revving) (dramatic music)

01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:13.833
(bell ringing)

01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:16.500
Sue!

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:18.166
Sue?

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:21.000
I just saw you on TV.

01:05:22.125 --> 01:05:23.250
Holy moly.

01:05:25.166 --> 01:05:26.708
Makes me want to join your class.

01:05:27.458 --> 01:05:27.875
Hey, you don't give

01:05:27.958 --> 01:05:29.000
private lessons, do you?

01:05:29.541 --> 01:05:31.208
(laughing)

01:05:31.833 --> 01:05:34.541
Hey, what about a

01:05:34.625 --> 01:05:36.666
drink at my place tonight?

01:05:38.833 --> 01:05:39.958
Come on, don't be shy.

01:05:40.833 --> 01:05:42.083
I see you standing behind

01:05:42.166 --> 01:05:43.625
the door there, gorgeous.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.458
All right, take your

01:05:48.541 --> 01:05:50.416
time, but it's a date.

01:05:51.916 --> 01:05:53.250
You know, pump it up

01:05:53.791 --> 01:05:55.166
You got to pump it up

01:05:55.708 --> 01:05:57.166
You know, pump it up

01:05:57.583 --> 01:05:58.958
You got to pump it up

01:06:00.125 --> 01:06:04.750
(engine revving)

01:06:04.833 --> 01:06:10.125
(dramatic music)

01:06:27.583 --> 01:06:35.291
(dramatic music)

01:06:35.375 --> 01:06:37.041
(gasping)

01:06:37.125 --> 01:06:37.291
Sue.

01:06:38.916 --> 01:06:44.958
(dramatic music)

01:06:45.041 --> 01:06:46.291
(gasping)

01:07:01.666 --> 01:07:21.333
(dramatic music)

01:07:23.666 --> 01:07:24.416
What can I get you?

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:27.083
(dramatic music)

01:07:28.916 --> 01:07:30.000
Moka Latte.

01:07:39.041 --> 01:07:40.916
It's long, isn't it?

01:07:43.208 --> 01:07:43.958
Excuse me?

01:07:48.208 --> 01:07:49.333
Seven days.

01:07:54.666 --> 01:08:17.458
(dramatic music)

01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:21.375
Did you follow me here?

01:08:22.583 --> 01:08:25.541
I was just curious to find out

01:08:25.625 --> 01:08:27.458
how things were going for you.

01:08:28.666 --> 01:08:30.125
Each time you feel a little

01:08:30.208 --> 01:08:34.500
more lonely, don't you think?

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.875
I don't know what you were talking about.

01:08:40.458 --> 01:08:40.833
I'm fine.

01:08:42.916 --> 01:08:43.666
Everything's fine.

01:08:44.666 --> 01:08:47.666
It gets harder each time to remember

01:08:47.750 --> 01:08:51.458
that you still deserve to exist.

01:08:51.666 --> 01:08:54.125
(dramatic music)

01:08:55.041 --> 01:08:55.916
That this part of

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.375
yourself is still worth something

01:08:59.458 --> 01:09:03.833
that you still matter.

01:09:08.541 --> 01:09:10.500
Has she started yet?

01:09:12.166 --> 01:09:14.416
Eating away at you?

01:09:15.833 --> 01:09:17.125
(dramatic music)

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:32.166
(gasping)

01:09:32.458 --> 01:09:32.666
Fuck!

01:09:33.291 --> 01:09:33.916
Watch out!

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:43.416
What?

01:09:45.958 --> 01:09:47.041
(dramatic music)

01:09:51.666 --> 01:09:53.708
(engine revving)

01:09:54.916 --> 01:09:55.125
Hey!

01:09:55.916 --> 01:09:56.250
Move!

01:09:59.458 --> 01:10:00.000
(engine revving)

01:10:21.666 --> 01:10:24.833
(dramatic music)

01:10:27.791 --> 01:10:29.208
You're still the most beautiful girl

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:30.666
in the whole wide world.

01:10:33.291 --> 01:10:39.791
(phone ringing)

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:41.083
Hello?

01:10:42.250 --> 01:10:43.083
Hi, Fred.

01:10:43.875 --> 01:10:44.625
It's Lizzie.

01:10:48.291 --> 01:10:48.541
Hello?

01:10:49.958 --> 01:10:51.166
Sorry, I mean, I'm a chalk.

01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:52.583
Oh.

01:10:52.958 --> 01:10:53.250
Wow.

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:54.666
Wow, wow.

01:10:55.375 --> 01:10:56.541
I thought I'd never

01:10:56.625 --> 01:10:57.666
hear from you again after--

01:10:57.750 --> 01:10:59.666
Oh gosh, no, no, not at all.

01:10:59.875 --> 01:11:00.791
I just, I've just

01:11:00.875 --> 01:11:02.916
been really busy lately.

01:11:03.791 --> 01:11:07.083
So listen, I was thinking that

01:11:09.291 --> 01:11:10.208
maybe we could get

01:11:10.291 --> 01:11:12.000
together and grab a drink.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:18.583
Are you still there?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.458
Sorry, I'm in shock.

01:11:21.541 --> 01:11:22.041
I'm in shock again.

01:11:23.541 --> 01:11:27.500
I could book Luigi's at eight.

01:11:28.833 --> 01:11:29.875
Eight in Luigi's?

01:11:30.125 --> 01:11:30.458
It is.

01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:34.083
I will see you tonight.

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:35.916
Bye.

01:11:36.541 --> 01:11:37.875
Okay, bye.

01:11:40.375 --> 01:11:42.791
(sighing)

01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:44.333
(sighing)

01:11:45.666 --> 01:11:48.250
(somber music)

01:12:21.208 --> 01:12:30.416
(knocking)

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.041
(knocking)

01:12:32.125 --> 01:12:35.416
(somber music)

01:12:45.666 --> 01:12:54.750
(knocking)

01:12:54.833 --> 01:12:59.708
(knocking)

01:12:59.791 --> 01:13:20.666
(somber music) (knocking)

01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:31.583
(glass shattering)

01:13:31.666 --> 01:13:35.416
(somber music)

01:13:45.666 --> 01:13:53.041
(somber music)

01:13:53.125 --> 01:13:55.791
(glass shattering)

01:13:55.875 --> 01:14:12.791
(knocking)

01:14:15.666 --> 01:14:18.250
(somber music)

01:14:45.666 --> 01:14:51.666
(somber music)

01:14:51.750 --> 01:15:02.208
(sighing) (ominous music)

01:15:15.666 --> 01:15:28.791
(ominous music)

01:15:28.875 --> 01:15:30.375
(door opening)

01:15:30.458 --> 01:15:34.375
(ominous music)

01:15:45.666 --> 01:15:58.250
(ominous music)

01:15:58.333 --> 01:16:03.041
(grunting)

01:16:03.125 --> 01:16:08.166
(ominous music)

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:09.833
(phone buzzing)

01:16:19.958 --> 01:16:20.375
(ominous music)

01:16:20.458 --> 01:16:25.541
(phone buzzing) (phone buzzing)

01:16:25.625 --> 01:16:28.625
(phone buzzing)

01:16:28.708 --> 01:16:31.208
(phone buzzing)

01:16:31.291 --> 01:16:31.416
(door opening)

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:33.375
(ominous music)

01:16:33.458 --> 01:16:38.250
(door opening)

01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.333
Hi everybody.

01:16:43.791 --> 01:16:44.041
Hi.

01:16:45.083 --> 01:16:46.291
Okay, here we go everyone.

01:16:46.541 --> 01:16:47.291
Clear the set please.

01:16:47.666 --> 01:16:49.041
First positions, thank you.

01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:49.916
Roll cameras.

01:16:50.875 --> 01:16:54.166
(beeping) And in three, two, one.

01:16:57.375 --> 01:16:57.750
(electronic music)

01:16:57.833 --> 01:16:59.875
Squat, squat, squat.

01:17:01.541 --> 01:17:02.416
(upbeat music) Circle those hips.

01:17:03.583 --> 01:17:04.250
(upbeat music) Circle those hips.

01:17:05.541 --> 01:17:07.500
(upbeat music) Contract, contract, contract,

01:17:08.041 --> 01:17:10.208
contract, contract, contract.

01:17:10.291 --> 01:17:10.500
(upbeat music)

01:17:10.583 --> 01:17:12.291
Contract, between your legs.

01:17:14.875 --> 01:17:16.041
(upbeat music)

01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:19.041
Cut.

01:17:20.458 --> 01:17:20.791
(beeping)

01:17:23.791 --> 01:17:27.916
I'm sorry, I thought I, thought I, I,

01:17:29.166 --> 01:17:29.833
I just got distracted.

01:17:31.500 --> 01:17:32.166
Not a problem, let's

01:17:32.250 --> 01:17:33.000
get right back to it.

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:34.250
Back to one please.

01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:39.041
Sorry, it's the control room now.

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:40.541
The director said he saw something

01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:41.708
bizarre on the monitor.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.250
Bring up the replay on camera two.

01:17:43.666 --> 01:17:44.166
Camera two.

01:17:48.791 --> 01:17:53.666
(ominous music)

01:17:55.875 --> 01:17:56.125
Forward.

01:17:58.583 --> 01:17:59.666
(electronic beeping)

01:18:03.125 --> 01:18:04.208
Can I have my dressing gown?

01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.416
Sorry, it's in your dressing room.

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:06.416
But I go and get it.

01:18:07.541 --> 01:18:08.583
Let's just take this frame by frame.

01:18:09.208 --> 01:18:15.833
(electronic beeping)

01:18:20.750 --> 01:18:24.625
I need five minutes.

01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:28.791
(electronic beeping)

01:18:39.208 --> 01:18:42.291
(electronic beeping)

01:19:09.208 --> 01:19:25.958
(electronic beeping)

01:19:26.041 --> 01:19:27.333
(electronic beeping)

01:19:27.416 --> 01:19:32.833
(screaming)

01:19:39.208 --> 01:19:45.166
(panting)

01:19:45.250 --> 01:19:50.375
(ominous music)

01:20:09.208 --> 01:20:12.416
(electronic beeping)

01:20:23.541 --> 01:20:23.791
Yes.

01:20:23.875 --> 01:20:25.375
This balance is not working.

01:20:25.958 --> 01:20:28.041
I barely have any time to enjoy myself

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:31.000
while she wastes seven days

01:20:31.166 --> 01:20:32.625
stuffing her face in front of the TV.

01:20:32.958 --> 01:20:34.916
Remember there is no she and you.

01:20:35.416 --> 01:20:35.583
(electronic beeping)

01:20:35.666 --> 01:20:36.166
(screaming)

01:20:38.291 --> 01:20:40.166
I love everybody.

01:20:45.375 --> 01:20:45.708
What's happening?

01:20:45.916 --> 01:20:46.375
Where is everybody?

01:20:47.125 --> 01:20:47.875
The TV's been canceled.

01:20:49.791 --> 01:20:50.458
What, why?

01:20:50.541 --> 01:20:50.750
Sue.

01:20:52.208 --> 01:20:52.875
Harvey wants to see you

01:20:52.958 --> 01:20:53.583
in his office immediately.

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:55.500
Okay.

01:20:56.791 --> 01:20:57.500
I'll go change him.

01:20:57.583 --> 01:20:58.708
No, he said now.

01:21:01.125 --> 01:21:01.708
(ominous music)

01:21:08.333 --> 01:21:14.625
(electronic beeping)

01:21:16.916 --> 01:21:17.833
I'll get right to the bond.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.083
We can't keep you on the morning show.

01:21:22.833 --> 01:21:23.375
But why?

01:21:23.541 --> 01:21:24.791
I just started.

01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:27.583
Ratings are through the roof.

01:21:28.833 --> 01:21:30.333
We started at 42.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.666
Now we're up to like--

01:21:33.833 --> 01:21:34.208
216.

01:21:35.041 --> 01:21:36.208
It's phenomenal.

01:21:36.583 --> 01:21:39.916
People love you.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.791
They adore you.

01:21:42.208 --> 01:21:44.958
They want more and more and more of you.

01:21:45.625 --> 01:21:46.458
That is why we have

01:21:46.541 --> 01:21:48.583
decided that we want you

01:21:48.666 --> 01:21:52.708
to host the New Year's Eve show.

01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:54.958
You mean the--

01:21:55.041 --> 01:21:56.583
The network's biggest show.

01:21:57.083 --> 01:21:58.916
50 million viewers live.

01:21:59.416 --> 01:22:01.416
You can't go higher than that.

01:22:03.041 --> 01:22:03.833
(laughing)

01:22:03.916 --> 01:22:04.583
That's gonna be intense.

01:22:04.666 --> 01:22:09.833
We only have a few more. So are you in?

01:22:12.583 --> 01:22:15.250
(ominous music)

01:22:15.333 --> 01:22:19.708
(door creaking)

01:22:19.791 --> 01:22:22.000
If you don't open the

01:22:22.083 --> 01:22:23.333
door and opportunity knocks,

01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:24.250
you won't get another chance.

01:22:26.333 --> 01:22:27.708
You of all people know this.

01:22:29.125 --> 01:22:31.458
(ominous music)

01:22:34.666 --> 01:22:37.166
(door creaking)

01:22:40.916 --> 01:22:41.875
Just one more day and

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:43.000
then I have a whole week off.

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:43.708
We can switch.

01:22:48.458 --> 01:22:55.125
(ominous music)

01:23:02.083 --> 01:23:03.375
We're doing the cover of Vogue.

01:23:05.291 --> 01:23:06.166
Just one more day, okay?

01:23:08.666 --> 01:23:14.625
(ominous music)

01:23:14.708 --> 01:23:19.625
(sighing)

01:23:40.125 --> 01:23:40.583
(ominous music)

01:23:40.666 --> 01:23:42.041
(gasping)

01:23:42.125 --> 01:23:45.083
(screaming)

01:23:45.166 --> 01:23:47.500
(ominous music)

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:57.333
(ominous music)

01:23:57.416 --> 01:24:17.791
Yes. She didn't respect the balance.

01:24:18.416 --> 01:24:19.583
She's stealing more

01:24:19.666 --> 01:24:20.916
and more time from me,

01:24:21.208 --> 01:24:22.875
completely without

01:24:22.958 --> 01:24:24.541
consideration of the consequences.

01:24:25.083 --> 01:24:26.541
She's a selfish bitch.

01:24:26.875 --> 01:24:27.750
Would you like to stop?

01:24:30.916 --> 01:24:31.250
Stop.

01:24:31.875 --> 01:24:32.833
You are the Matrix.

01:24:33.625 --> 01:24:34.875
If you are not satisfied,

01:24:35.125 --> 01:24:36.791
you can put an end to the experience

01:24:37.041 --> 01:24:37.833
and go back to being

01:24:37.916 --> 01:24:39.458
just you on your own.

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:41.166
Would you like to stop?

01:24:44.375 --> 01:24:46.500
Will it go back to the way it was before?

01:24:46.916 --> 01:24:47.458
What has been

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:49.000
transferred won't come back,

01:24:49.208 --> 01:24:50.708
but you can stop the experience.

01:24:50.916 --> 01:24:52.750
As of now, would you like to stop?

01:24:53.166 --> 01:24:55.791
To go back to being just you on your own?

01:24:58.916 --> 01:24:59.166
No.

01:25:01.958 --> 01:25:03.000
No, no, no.

01:25:03.875 --> 01:25:04.666
I can't stop.

01:25:06.833 --> 01:25:07.333
She just--

01:25:07.666 --> 01:25:08.416
I did it.

01:25:09.750 --> 01:25:10.208
I did it.

01:25:10.291 --> 01:25:12.625
I did it. I did it. (door slams)

01:25:15.958 --> 01:25:18.125
The balance just needs to be respected.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:19.208
So respected.

01:25:20.291 --> 01:25:21.375
(phone beeps)

01:25:23.458 --> 01:25:24.625
Stop it, stop it, stop

01:25:24.708 --> 01:25:26.291
it, stop it, stop it.

01:25:28.166 --> 01:25:32.333
(ominous music)

01:25:35.666 --> 01:25:36.625
You are the Matrix.

01:25:37.916 --> 01:25:38.041
Well,

01:25:38.125 --> 01:25:40.375
congratulations, you've won $25,000.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.500
We're standing on our final chance

01:25:42.583 --> 01:25:43.875
and it's your second question

01:25:43.958 --> 01:25:45.333
in our big question

01:25:45.416 --> 01:25:48.458
round and play for $250,000.

01:25:49.208 --> 01:25:51.708
(audience cheers)

01:25:51.791 --> 01:25:53.458
And you'll have just 45

01:25:53.541 --> 01:25:55.041
seconds to come up to get

01:25:55.166 --> 01:25:57.458
the correct answer that you can't--

01:25:57.541 --> 01:25:58.375
(woman gasps)

01:26:00.875 --> 01:26:10.583
(woman gasps)

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:12.541
(woman groans)

01:26:12.625 --> 01:26:15.500
(woman groans)

01:26:15.583 --> 01:26:17.250
(woman gasps)

01:26:29.833 --> 01:26:35.166
(woman groans)

01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:38.958
(woman screams)

01:26:50.125 --> 01:26:55.708
Just a little something to keep you busy.

01:27:05.625 --> 01:27:08.916
(door slams)

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:09.125
Fuck.

01:27:24.875 --> 01:27:25.083
Boss.

01:27:29.833 --> 01:27:35.291
(ominous music)

01:27:36.500 --> 01:27:38.833
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she is here.

01:27:39.250 --> 01:27:42.666
The superstar of the moment, Sue.

01:27:42.833 --> 01:27:43.333
Are you ready?

01:27:43.708 --> 01:27:45.333
Let's welcome her, Sue.

01:27:46.333 --> 01:27:47.166
(audience cheers)

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.666
You popped up nowhere on

01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:52.375
our screens like a tornado.

01:27:53.083 --> 01:27:54.500
I don't think anybody was

01:27:54.583 --> 01:27:56.166
really prepared for this world.

01:27:56.416 --> 01:27:57.666
(audience cheers)

01:27:59.833 --> 01:28:02.125
(thunder rumbles)

01:28:02.208 --> 01:28:03.708
(audience cheers)

01:28:03.791 --> 01:28:07.000
It all started with the morning show

01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:09.708
and rumor has it that you are

01:28:09.791 --> 01:28:11.916
up for Tom Grant's next movie.

01:28:13.083 --> 01:28:13.958
(audience cheers)

01:28:14.291 --> 01:28:15.708
Wait, just a moment.

01:28:16.125 --> 01:28:18.833
I'm being told that you are going to host

01:28:18.916 --> 01:28:20.416
the New Year's Eve show.

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:21.208
Can you confirm this?

01:28:22.208 --> 01:28:22.958
Yes, that's right.

01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:24.500
Yes, that's right.

01:28:25.541 --> 01:28:25.583
(ominous music)

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:30.000
Oh my God, that is huge news.

01:28:33.458 --> 01:28:34.791
Tell us a little bit about yourself.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:35.666
Where are you from?

01:28:35.916 --> 01:28:37.000
How did you get discovered?

01:28:37.666 --> 01:28:40.541
I want, we want to know everything.

01:28:42.625 --> 01:28:45.833
(ominous music) Well, I mean, there's

01:28:45.916 --> 01:28:47.791
really not very much to tell.

01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:50.750
I'm just a girl from a

01:28:50.833 --> 01:28:53.166
very small town in Indiana.

01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:55.208
I'm sure that you've never heard of it.

01:28:55.625 --> 01:28:57.500
In fact, it's not even a town.

01:28:57.833 --> 01:28:58.750
I'm not sure you could

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:00.166
really even call it a village.

01:29:00.250 --> 01:29:02.791
It's a farm, perhaps?

01:29:05.416 --> 01:29:05.666
(audience laughs)

01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:08.958
(ominous music)

01:29:10.333 --> 01:29:11.875
But ever since I can remember,

01:29:12.083 --> 01:29:13.625
it has always been my

01:29:13.708 --> 01:29:15.000
dream to be on screen.

01:29:15.791 --> 01:29:17.583
This is my dream.

01:29:17.666 --> 01:29:18.583
As a child, I used to

01:29:18.666 --> 01:29:20.083
put on shows for my family.

01:29:20.708 --> 01:29:21.541
Mm, your family.

01:29:22.500 --> 01:29:23.375
How sweet.

01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:25.500
(ominous music)

01:29:26.291 --> 01:29:30.250
So, everyone is aware that

01:29:30.333 --> 01:29:33.000
you replaced Elizabeth Sparkle.

01:29:34.375 --> 01:29:37.500
And no doubt about it, you stepped in,

01:29:37.750 --> 01:29:39.125
you turned up the volume,

01:29:39.333 --> 01:29:41.208
and you rocked their world.

01:29:41.833 --> 01:29:42.916
Were you a fan of her show?

01:29:47.875 --> 01:29:52.791
Um, well, well, I can't, uh,

01:29:54.458 --> 01:29:55.291
I can't really say that I

01:29:55.375 --> 01:29:57.958
actually watched her show.

01:29:58.833 --> 01:30:01.041
You do know that we're not exactly from

01:30:01.125 --> 01:30:02.083
the same generation.

01:30:03.250 --> 01:30:03.291
(audience laughs)

01:30:03.416 --> 01:30:05.083
And you have to admit, it

01:30:05.166 --> 01:30:06.333
was a bit old-fashioned.

01:30:09.625 --> 01:30:10.833
Jurassic Fitness, really.

01:30:12.375 --> 01:30:14.291
(audience laughs) Jurassic Fitness, it needed a change.

01:30:15.791 --> 01:30:16.500
(ominous music)

01:30:16.583 --> 01:30:18.083
I'll fucking show you.

01:30:19.458 --> 01:30:20.166
You really wanna see

01:30:20.250 --> 01:30:21.375
some Jurassic Fitness?

01:30:24.708 --> 01:30:25.541
You want it?

01:30:26.833 --> 01:30:28.166
Come on, come get your

01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:30.000
fucking Jurassic Fitness!

01:30:32.625 --> 01:30:35.125
(ominous music)

01:30:38.833 --> 01:30:41.375
But my mother was a huge fan of hers.

01:30:43.500 --> 01:30:46.916
So, every morning, rain or shine,

01:30:48.208 --> 01:30:49.916
Sparkle, your life, was on TV.

01:30:50.458 --> 01:30:51.791
So, in a way, I grew up with her.

01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:54.000
Whether I liked it or not.

01:30:54.791 --> 01:30:54.833
(audience laughs)

01:30:55.500 --> 01:30:56.458
I guess that's why you could say

01:30:56.541 --> 01:30:58.000
we have some sort of connection.

01:30:58.375 --> 01:30:59.666
Some sort of connection.

01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:02.833
You wouldn't exist without me.

01:31:04.375 --> 01:31:09.291
(audience applauds)

01:31:12.958 --> 01:31:14.000
Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum, bum.

01:31:14.250 --> 01:31:15.791
It is time, ladies and

01:31:15.875 --> 01:31:18.250
gentlemen, for our final question.

01:31:18.708 --> 01:31:20.833
The question that we ask each

01:31:20.916 --> 01:31:24.083
and every one of our guests.

01:31:24.291 --> 01:31:24.458
Okay.

01:31:25.250 --> 01:31:25.291
(laughs)

01:31:25.333 --> 01:31:27.666
Would you share one of your

01:31:27.750 --> 01:31:29.958
little beauty secrets with us?

01:31:31.875 --> 01:31:33.041
Just one little trick of yours

01:31:33.125 --> 01:31:34.125
that helps you look

01:31:34.208 --> 01:31:36.083
so incredibly stunning.

01:31:36.166 --> 01:31:36.916
I mean, look at you.

01:31:37.125 --> 01:31:37.791
I don't know.

01:31:38.375 --> 01:31:39.041
Say it!

01:31:39.958 --> 01:31:40.833
Say it!

01:31:42.208 --> 01:31:42.750
Let me think.

01:31:43.083 --> 01:31:43.583
Say it!

01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:45.208
Tell them who your

01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:46.791
little beauty secret is!

01:31:46.916 --> 01:31:48.041
I guess, I would just

01:31:48.125 --> 01:31:49.291
show them right here.

01:31:49.625 --> 01:31:50.958
Here's your little beauty secret.

01:31:51.416 --> 01:31:52.958
I guess I just try to be myself.

01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:54.541
To be sincere and

01:31:54.625 --> 01:31:56.541
grateful for all that I have.

01:31:57.208 --> 01:31:58.041
And to always remember

01:31:58.125 --> 01:31:59.208
to leave with my heart.

01:31:59.458 --> 01:32:01.416
Oh, I'm here at the sweetheart center.

01:32:02.458 --> 01:32:02.916
(grunts)

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:15.750
I just, oh, I try to be myself.

01:32:16.208 --> 01:32:17.583
(laughs)

01:32:18.291 --> 01:32:18.541
Stop it!

01:32:20.125 --> 01:32:20.666
Stop it.

01:32:21.458 --> 01:32:22.708
You're taking it from me.

01:32:23.500 --> 01:32:24.750
That's your little secret.

01:32:26.541 --> 01:32:26.875
Stop it!

01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:28.458
(grunts)

01:32:28.541 --> 01:32:31.708
(whispers)

01:32:41.833 --> 01:32:44.500
You have to control yourself!

01:32:46.208 --> 01:32:53.833
(growls)

01:33:04.541 --> 01:33:07.166
I can't go back, I forgot.

01:33:13.416 --> 01:33:13.916
Oh, shit.

01:33:16.083 --> 01:33:18.333
Gross old rat.

01:33:19.375 --> 01:33:19.875
Stop it!

01:33:44.333 --> 01:33:50.833
(growls)

01:33:50.916 --> 01:34:03.833
(upbeat music)

01:34:19.708 --> 01:34:26.541
(dramatic music)

01:34:34.208 --> 01:34:34.750
Coming to bed?

01:34:43.958 --> 01:34:46.125
Yes, I'll be right there.

01:34:50.500 --> 01:35:15.291
(dramatic music) (dramatic music)

01:35:42.541 --> 01:35:48.708
(phone rings)

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:51.708
Yes.

01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:53.625
Hi, hi, this is emergency.

01:35:53.958 --> 01:35:56.125
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

01:35:58.833 --> 01:35:59.041
Hello?

01:36:01.291 --> 01:36:02.291
It's fucking 503.

01:36:02.916 --> 01:36:03.166
Yes.

01:36:03.708 --> 01:36:03.958
Fuck!

01:36:04.916 --> 01:36:06.041
I'm telling you, this is urgent.

01:36:06.291 --> 01:36:07.416
There's no more stabilizer fluid.

01:36:07.833 --> 01:36:09.125
It means you've reached the end.

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:10.875
(dramatic music)

01:36:12.125 --> 01:36:12.833
What do you mean the end?

01:36:13.208 --> 01:36:14.375
You've drained it all out.

01:36:15.083 --> 01:36:16.375
If you want more, you must

01:36:16.458 --> 01:36:17.541
let the fluid regenerate.

01:36:19.083 --> 01:36:20.000
Tell me how to do it.

01:36:20.083 --> 01:36:22.291
I need to stabilize myself right now.

01:36:22.875 --> 01:36:23.958
You simply have to switch.

01:36:27.458 --> 01:36:28.125
Excuse me?

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:29.833
The switch reboots the

01:36:29.916 --> 01:36:31.125
fluid secretion process

01:36:31.333 --> 01:36:32.458
so you can continue to

01:36:32.541 --> 01:36:33.416
enjoy the experience.

01:36:33.875 --> 01:36:35.625
No, no, no, no, no.

01:36:36.208 --> 01:36:37.583
I can't switch, I can't.

01:36:38.625 --> 01:36:39.333
Especially not now.

01:36:39.625 --> 01:36:41.000
There is no other option.

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:49.166
(woman screams)

01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:55.041

01:36:59.750 --> 01:37:00.083

01:37:08.333 --> 01:37:08.541

01:37:21.625 --> 01:37:21.791
Babe?

01:37:25.833 --> 01:37:26.041
Sue?

01:37:27.458 --> 01:37:27.833
You all right?

01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.166
Should I start out tomorrow?

01:37:38.166 --> 01:37:41.166
(woman groans)

01:37:41.250 --> 01:37:41.666
Babe?

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.875
Babe?

01:37:55.375 --> 01:37:56.166
Sue?

01:37:57.416 --> 01:37:58.125
Is something wrong?

01:38:01.916 --> 01:38:03.875
You look cranky because

01:38:03.958 --> 01:38:04.666
you're related business.

01:38:06.208 --> 01:38:08.041
(dramatic music)

01:38:10.125 --> 01:38:10.750
Sue, open the door.

01:38:11.875 --> 01:38:13.291
Come on, Sue.

01:38:14.375 --> 01:38:15.708
Sue, funny, I need to take a picture.

01:38:17.541 --> 01:38:18.500
Sue, open the door.

01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:21.208
Open the door, Sue, come on.

01:38:23.500 --> 01:38:40.166

01:38:40.208 --> 01:38:40.250

01:38:40.291 --> 01:38:40.458
Come on.

01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:51.541
(woman screams)

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:51.791
Guys!

01:38:53.500 --> 01:38:54.291
What the fuck?

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.250
The fuck out!

01:38:57.708 --> 01:38:59.875
Who's this? Who the fuck is that?

01:38:59.958 --> 01:39:01.250
Leave me alone!

01:39:04.291 --> 01:39:11.500
What the fuck?

01:39:53.500 --> 01:39:59.708
Doorbell

01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:05.500
Yes?

01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:10.208
It's 503.

01:40:12.208 --> 01:40:13.416
I want to stop.

01:40:13.958 --> 01:40:15.708
Are you sure? Once you

01:40:15.791 --> 01:40:17.125
stop, you can't go back.

01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:20.458
I want to stop! I want to fucking stop!

01:40:20.541 --> 01:40:22.958
I want to stop!

01:40:24.208 --> 01:40:24.500

01:42:38.666 --> 01:42:40.500
Once you stop, you can't go back.

01:42:41.375 --> 01:42:43.458
You will simply remain on your own.

01:42:44.625 --> 01:42:46.500
Just on your own.

01:42:47.500 --> 01:42:50.750

01:44:03.708 --> 01:44:06.166
I need you.

01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:09.583

01:44:32.250 --> 01:44:34.125
You have to come back. Come back.
