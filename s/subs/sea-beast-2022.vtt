04:30.416 --> 04:32.291
we've passed Rum Pepper Island.

It's heading for the Dregmorr Sea.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.791

04:40.416 --> 04:41.625
If we're gonna do battle

04:41.708 --> 04:44.333
with the greatest
and most terrible thing in the sea,

04:44.416 --> 04:46.083
it's best not to wait till after.

04:46.916 --> 04:48.541
There might not be an after.

05:23.541 --> 05:24.958
-We press on.
-What?

05:25.041 --> 05:27.750
[Captain Crow] If Jim Nicklebones were
half the sea dog he says he is,

05:27.833 --> 05:29.500
he wouldn't be in this mess.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.583
Captain, you know the code.

05:32.125 --> 05:36.791
It binds us to all who come before
and all who come after.

And even that rum gagger Jim Nicklebones.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.750

and I don't like the main.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.833
She can't fight.

15:01.916 --> 15:04.250
Then we'll come back
for the Bluster when she can.

15:04.333 --> 15:07.166
-Repairs shouldn't take too--
-Set a course for Three Bridges.

15:08.416 --> 15:09.375
We're going home.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.791
[man] Right mess, aren't ya?

15:23.458 --> 15:24.708
Let's get you fixed up.

15:25.916 --> 15:28.291
[Mr. Crisp] If you know
what's good for ya,

15:28.875 --> 15:30.541
you'll keep clear of the captain.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.166
He was close enough
to smell that red devil.

15:33.250 --> 15:38.125
But if he can't have the Bluster's hide,
he'll have ours, to be sure.

15:39.291 --> 15:40.166
[coughing]

15:44.083 --> 15:46.833
Why, it's gloomy
as the Helgard trenches in here.

15:46.916 --> 15:50.541
[grunts] We've taken
some right proper monsters on this hunt,

15:50.625 --> 15:53.041
and the royals will pay us accordingly.

15:53.125 --> 15:56.458
And then we'll come back,
and we'll take that red devil.

15:56.958 --> 16:00.625
Can we beat it, Jacob?
They say the Bluster moves the very sea.

16:01.125 --> 16:04.833
Aye, and it shoots fireballs
out of its eyes, they say.

16:04.916 --> 16:06.958
It's enough to make your knees wobble.

16:08.666 --> 16:12.416
But I ain't afraid,
'cause I'm on the Inevitable with you lot.

16:13.291 --> 16:16.500
This ship has taken
more of them beasts than any other,

16:16.583 --> 16:18.708
and she's got the scars to prove it.

16:18.791 --> 16:21.500
As do we, Jacob! [laughs]

16:22.083 --> 16:22.916
Aye.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.833
And every hunter's scar is a life saved.

16:37.750 --> 16:39.833
All hunters die of the same thing.

16:39.916 --> 16:43.458
Aye, being a hunter. [laughs]

16:43.541 --> 16:45.833
That's right. Being a hunter.

16:46.791 --> 16:49.666
But every hunter dies a great death.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.250

17:03.916 --> 17:06.541
Speaking of dying a great death.

17:06.625 --> 17:08.458
Nice knowing you, Jacob!

17:08.541 --> 17:10.958
[laughter]

17:11.041 --> 17:16.625
We'll think of you often and fondly.
[laughs]

17:22.000 --> 17:23.666
You wanted to see me, Captain?

17:24.708 --> 17:25.541
Sit.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.500
Captain, we'll get the Bluster.

17:29.583 --> 17:32.666
We know where it is now,
and you will have your revenge.

17:34.541 --> 17:37.416
I'm… I'm just sorry it wasn't today.

17:38.166 --> 17:42.666
Jacob, I hate that devil
with every fiber in me being,

17:42.750 --> 17:45.541
but saving Jim Nicklebones
was the right thing to do.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.583
You steered me right today.

17:50.125 --> 17:52.708
Well, I'm… I-I'm glad you see it that way.

17:53.416 --> 17:57.791
So we'll go home,
collect our bounty, and repair the ship.

17:58.583 --> 18:03.750
And we'll come back for that beast
and bring hell down upon it.

18:05.416 --> 18:06.416
[sighs]

18:12.166 --> 18:13.000
And then what?

18:15.333 --> 18:17.083
What is to become of the Inevitable

18:18.125 --> 18:19.208
after I'm gone?

18:22.291 --> 18:23.208

18:24.083 --> 18:25.666

18:25.750 --> 18:29.375

and spar has been replaced

18:29.458 --> 18:31.166
since the day she was launched.

18:33.833 --> 18:35.000
Yet she lives on.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.875
It's an eternal thing.

18:40.708 --> 18:41.666
But I am not.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.291
[door creaks]

18:48.125 --> 18:48.958
Come.

18:52.166 --> 18:53.875
Here is my greatness.

18:54.833 --> 18:56.500
My father's before me,

18:57.500 --> 18:59.166
and his father's before him.

19:00.708 --> 19:02.541
On the day we take the Red Bluster,

19:04.041 --> 19:06.375
I will make me last entry as captain.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.000
Then it'll be your time.

19:13.875 --> 19:16.541
I've known it since the day
I pulled you from the sea.

19:17.208 --> 19:19.208
[soft music playing]

19:22.458 --> 19:24.125
You'd been out there for days.

19:25.333 --> 19:27.291
But there was something in you, Jacob.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.041
A fire that wouldn't die.

19:30.875 --> 19:32.166
Then I held you,

19:33.291 --> 19:34.166
and I knew.

19:36.041 --> 19:37.875
The fates had brought me a son.

19:38.791 --> 19:42.958
And that one day,
you would be captain of the Inevitable.

19:56.208 --> 19:57.416
The day you found me,

19:57.916 --> 20:02.750
I swore I would do everything in my power
to keep people safe from them demons.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.416
If you would grant me this ship,
I would accept,

20:08.166 --> 20:10.125
and it would be my honor.

20:10.916 --> 20:12.000

the king and queen at first light.

[tankards clatter]

right out of her veggie patch,

The royals don't pay you
to honor such codes.

26:59.125 --> 27:02.833
They pay you to kill monsters.

27:02.916 --> 27:08.958
How many more ships will be lost
because you let the Bluster slip away?

27:11.458 --> 27:16.458
[king] This was once a small kingdom
with a big idea.

27:16.541 --> 27:20.250
To send hunters out
to repel the beasts from our shores

27:20.333 --> 27:24.125
and usher in a new era of peace.

27:24.208 --> 27:28.083
It's been hundreds of years
since the dark times,

27:28.166 --> 27:30.791
but as long as the Bluster lives,

27:30.875 --> 27:34.291
people will still
look to the seas with fear.

27:34.375 --> 27:38.750
So today marks the beginning of a new era.

27:38.833 --> 27:42.875
The Crown will no longer
support the hunters.

27:42.958 --> 27:44.541
She's quite a sight, isn't she?

27:45.041 --> 27:48.166
The Imperator is the most
heavily-armed ship ever to set sail.

27:48.666 --> 27:51.750
The Royal Navy will push
deep into the unknown world

27:51.833 --> 27:56.166
and eradicate every sea beast in our path.

27:56.666 --> 27:57.833
Not in that thing.

27:57.916 --> 27:59.250
She rests too low.

27:59.833 --> 28:01.958
And them fixed cannons is useless.

28:02.666 --> 28:05.333
And her Captain is an ass.

28:05.416 --> 28:08.666
[gasps] It's time
for you to leave, Captain.

28:09.500 --> 28:10.666
Your time is up.

28:11.750 --> 28:17.000
Admiral, have you ever seen one of them
beasts that wasn't hanging from a ceiling?

28:18.166 --> 28:21.291
Don't send your soldiers to die
in a ship like that.

28:22.041 --> 28:23.500
It's not built for hunting,

28:24.458 --> 28:25.583
and neither are you.

28:25.666 --> 28:30.333
I assure you,
I am not afraid of those beasts.

28:30.416 --> 28:31.625
Then you're a fool!

28:31.708 --> 28:34.375
And you'll take
a lot of good sailors down with you!

28:34.458 --> 28:37.833
General, see the hunters out.
We're done with them.

28:37.916 --> 28:42.333
We hunters have shed blood,
while you lot hid behind walls

28:42.416 --> 28:44.541
and drew lines on maps.

28:44.625 --> 28:46.333
You're cowards, the lot of ya!

28:46.416 --> 28:50.458
General, the Captain
is to be placed under arrest,

28:50.541 --> 28:53.541
and the Inevitable decommissioned.

28:54.625 --> 28:55.958
W-W-Wait, wait!

28:58.416 --> 29:00.958
Uh, Your Grace. [chuckles nervously]

29:01.500 --> 29:05.250
The, uh… The Captain
is well-known for his temper,

29:05.333 --> 29:08.333
but his talents as a hunter
have served you well.

29:08.833 --> 29:10.041
He's opened the seas

29:10.125 --> 29:13.375
and made your empire
the envy of the known world.

29:13.875 --> 29:18.250
Now, I believe the world
still needs the hunters,

29:18.333 --> 29:19.416
so prove me wrong.

29:20.541 --> 29:23.125
Give us one more try for the Bluster.

29:23.625 --> 29:28.125
If we take it, you keep your promise,
and we continue our alliance.

29:28.625 --> 29:30.250
If the Imperator takes the Bluster,

29:30.750 --> 29:33.291
well, you can tear down
the Inevitable for scrap,

29:33.833 --> 29:35.916
and the days of the hunters will be over.

29:36.583 --> 29:37.666
Either way,

29:37.750 --> 29:38.625
you win.

29:39.166 --> 29:42.458
I, for one, would relish the opportunity.

29:44.458 --> 29:46.750
Then we have a contest.

29:49.583 --> 29:50.666
Get set.

29:52.291 --> 29:53.458
Go.

29:53.541 --> 29:57.500
We'll take the Bluster
and bring it to your doorstep.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.333
The days of hunters are not over.

30:00.875 --> 30:02.083
Not nearly.

30:02.875 --> 30:04.875
[dramatic music playing]

30:09.708 --> 30:12.416
When we reach the Dregmorr,
we'll follow the trenches.

30:12.500 --> 30:16.916
We stay battle-ready, clear decks,
sharpened flints, and fresh cartridge.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.041
The Bluster's hide will be plenty thick.

30:19.541 --> 30:22.208
-Best to use the long spears.
-[indistinct shouting]

30:22.291 --> 30:27.250
[Sarah] Them archers won't do any good,
but we've got plenty of carcass shot.

30:27.333 --> 30:30.541
[Captain Crow] We'll hit it with fire,
then go for a sleigh ride.

30:30.625 --> 30:32.625
That's the way with something like this.

30:33.333 --> 30:36.500
[Jacob] We're ready, Captain.
We'll take that red demon.

30:36.583 --> 30:39.333
For we are hunters.

30:39.416 --> 30:41.708
And we will bring all of our skill

30:42.416 --> 30:46.125
and all of our rage down upon this beast.

30:46.208 --> 30:48.875
And there will be justice!

30:48.958 --> 30:51.791
[cheering]

30:51.875 --> 30:55.000
But that will not be the end
of this great ship.

30:55.083 --> 30:58.583
For no one has sailed
beyond the Dregmorr Sea.

30:58.666 --> 31:01.291
No one knows what dangers lurk

31:01.375 --> 31:03.208
in that terrible unknown.

31:04.250 --> 31:05.583
But it will be this ship,

31:06.625 --> 31:10.250
under Jacob Holland,
that will pierce the darkness.

31:10.333 --> 31:12.208
[cheering]

31:13.000 --> 31:17.000
So let's drink to a successful hunt,
with many more to come.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.791
[cheering and shouting]

31:26.541 --> 31:28.458
-[Maisie] Ow!
-[sailor 1] What was that?

31:29.416 --> 31:32.041
-[sailor 2] It came from the keg.
-[sailor 3] What was that?

31:33.625 --> 31:35.125
[Jacob inhales and grunts]

31:38.333 --> 31:39.166
[chuckles]

31:41.000 --> 31:42.583
You stowed away?

31:42.666 --> 31:44.916
I stowed away.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.708
[sighs] You stowed away.

31:46.791 --> 31:47.666
Uh, I…

31:48.500 --> 31:49.625
Yeah.

31:49.708 --> 31:52.000
Well, we're dropping you off
at the nearest port.

31:52.083 --> 31:53.708
We're going after the Bluster.

31:53.791 --> 31:56.833
-We can't have a kid mucking about.
-[Captain Crow] What's this?

31:58.916 --> 32:01.666
The name's Maisie Brumble,

32:02.541 --> 32:05.166
but you need no introduction.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.833
You've been swallowed whole,

32:07.916 --> 32:11.125
shot through the heart, and cut to pieces.

32:11.625 --> 32:15.666
But the worms won't eat you,
and hell won't take you, so here you are!

32:15.750 --> 32:19.083
The right, proud commander
of the second-greatest hunting ship

32:19.166 --> 32:20.500
what ever sailed.

32:20.583 --> 32:22.083
Second-greatest?

32:22.958 --> 32:25.583
Which then, may I ask, is the greatest?

32:25.666 --> 32:28.250
I'm partial to the Monarch,

32:28.333 --> 32:30.708
for it's the ship me parents served on.

32:31.958 --> 32:32.875
I see.

32:33.791 --> 32:36.000
Then they died heroes, didn't they?

32:37.000 --> 32:37.833
Aye.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.041
I like this kid.

32:40.958 --> 32:43.291
-She's all vinegar.
-But, C-Captain--

32:43.375 --> 32:45.708
Sarah, be good enough to take her in,
would you?

32:46.208 --> 32:47.500
Aye, Captain.

32:49.083 --> 32:51.333
Congratulations, Captain Someday.

32:52.208 --> 32:53.041
Uh…

32:53.125 --> 32:54.583
[sea shanty playing]

32:54.666 --> 32:56.750
[indistinct chatter]

32:56.833 --> 32:58.000
[sea shanty continues]

33:02.333 --> 33:03.250
[scoffs]

33:07.333 --> 33:08.583
[sea shanty fades]

33:08.666 --> 33:09.583
[door closes]

33:12.791 --> 33:13.875
[metal clanks]

33:14.583 --> 33:15.416
[gun cocks]

33:23.708 --> 33:24.916
Sleep there.

33:26.916 --> 33:29.583
You're… Sarah Sharpe.

33:33.083 --> 33:35.750
They say no first mate
is more loyal than--

33:35.833 --> 33:36.916
[Sarah] That's enough.

33:37.416 --> 33:39.333
I've heard your speeches, Miss.

33:39.416 --> 33:42.250
My speeches kept me on this boat.

33:42.333 --> 33:46.291
You're on this boat because Captain Crow
won't stop to put you off it.

33:47.916 --> 33:49.500
The hunt is all.

33:50.416 --> 33:53.416
So give him your absolute obedience.

33:56.833 --> 33:58.375
Or fall on that yourself,

33:58.458 --> 34:01.250
because I'll visit worse than death on ya.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.416
You're

34:04.333 --> 34:06.041
amazing.

34:08.666 --> 34:09.500
[sighs]

34:09.583 --> 34:11.583
[sea shanty playing]

34:22.416 --> 34:23.625
[sea shanty fades]

34:24.833 --> 34:26.958
We passed Rum Pepper Island in the night.

34:27.583 --> 34:29.208
We've reached the Dregmorr.

34:29.291 --> 34:32.375
Aye, and we'll find
that thing soon enough.

34:32.458 --> 34:34.833
[metal scraping]

34:37.541 --> 34:42.000
I wonder if I might need
something a little… larger?

34:42.083 --> 34:44.166
Hey, where'd you get that knife?

34:44.250 --> 34:47.625
Sarah gave it to me,
'cause I'm a hunter now.

34:48.125 --> 34:51.708
-A hunter who needs to go to bed.
-But I'm too much awake to sleep.

34:51.791 --> 34:54.291
I'm on the Inevitable with Captain Crow.

34:54.375 --> 34:56.833
Them pictures in me books come to life,

34:56.916 --> 34:59.750
and exacting bloody revenge!

34:59.833 --> 35:02.041
Go, get your rest.

35:02.875 --> 35:05.083
Aye, Captain. [chuckles]

35:05.166 --> 35:07.416
We's gonna kill that thing, ain't we?

35:07.500 --> 35:09.458
And they'll make statues of us.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.708
We'll kill it, all right. Now get!

35:11.791 --> 35:13.166
[chuckles] Hmm.

35:13.666 --> 35:14.708
[giggles]

35:16.166 --> 35:17.875
The monsters, I can handle.

35:17.958 --> 35:20.458
But that one, she'll be the death of me.

35:22.041 --> 35:25.750
You'll recall the hunter's code
binds us to all who come before

35:25.833 --> 35:27.541
and all who come after.

35:28.208 --> 35:29.041
[chuckles]

35:29.916 --> 35:31.708
I see a fire in her.

35:31.791 --> 35:33.791
Same fire I saw in you.

35:35.541 --> 35:38.958
-[distant groaning]
-[ropes creak]

[creaking]

35:43.791 --> 35:44.875
Beat to quarters!

35:45.625 --> 35:47.208
Let's have her ready!

35:47.708 --> 35:50.791
Today's the day we do what we do!

35:50.875 --> 35:54.291
[indistinct shouting]

35:55.208 --> 35:58.125
Fighting trim! Clew up fore a' main!

35:58.208 --> 36:02.333
Harpooners, tie off them darts!
We're going for a sleigh ride!

36:04.416 --> 36:05.916
[Ms. Merino] Heave away!

and we'll send it right back.

36:39.000 --> 36:41.250
Carcass shot if you please, gunners!

36:41.333 --> 36:42.958
Protect our broadside.

36:43.041 --> 36:44.625
[indistinct shouting]

36:44.708 --> 36:46.583
All right, ya fish killers!

36:46.666 --> 36:49.500
We come all this way
for a proper fight and--

36:49.583 --> 36:50.416
[Maisie] Jacob!

36:51.375 --> 36:52.458
What's happening?

36:52.958 --> 36:54.791
Maisie, get back to your room!

36:55.500 --> 36:56.958

38:05.583 --> 38:08.458
We got it hooked. Now we'll wear it down.

38:08.541 --> 38:10.375
Full sail, Ms. Merino!

38:10.458 --> 38:13.000
[Ms. Merino] Square the yards!
Get it off the pins!

38:13.083 --> 38:16.750
[Captain Crow] It'll fight the very wind
till there's no fight left in it.

and I won't start now.

We must!

No.

Well,

42:37.958 --> 42:38.916
yeah.

42:41.833 --> 42:43.875
Is it gonna chew us,

42:44.375 --> 42:50.250
or will we get digested slowly with acids?

42:50.333 --> 42:53.958
I don't know, Maisie.
This is all new territory for me.

42:54.041 --> 42:56.750
Haven't you hunted these things
your whole life?

42:56.833 --> 42:59.166
We kill 'em, lass. We don't study 'em.

Well, I don't know.
I just get pumped up and kind of wing it.

used to come right up to shore.

50:08.958 --> 50:10.583
That nowhere was safe.

50:11.666 --> 50:12.583
Is that true?

50:13.916 --> 50:15.166
Of course it's true.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.000
You saw it?

50:17.583 --> 50:21.166
It was before my time,
but everyone knows it's true.

50:22.125 --> 50:25.375
What if them things
ain't as bad as they say?

50:25.958 --> 50:28.166
I mean, the sea is their home.

50:28.916 --> 50:31.000
We went after her, didn't we?

50:32.000 --> 50:34.291
What if we just left 'em alone?

50:34.375 --> 50:37.041
We kill them because they kill us.

50:37.125 --> 50:40.708
Do I need to remind you
that one of them things took your parents?

50:40.791 --> 50:42.833
Should they have just left
the monsters alone?

50:43.875 --> 50:46.708
I… don't know.

Oh, you are lost, girl.

and still be wrong.

Oh, "Red," is it?

51:10.708 --> 51:12.083
She, not it.

51:12.166 --> 51:15.458
I think it's a she, and I think
she was protecting us from Crow.

51:15.541 --> 51:18.416
You're giving that beast
way too much credit.

51:18.500 --> 51:22.750
-He was pointing a gun at you, and he–
-He was pointing it at you, through me.

51:22.833 --> 51:24.750
Because you cut them lines.

51:24.833 --> 51:26.666
I don't wanna argue about it, all right?

51:26.750 --> 51:29.708
'Cause I don't want to attract
any of the multitude of monsters

that, that I wouldn't be on
if you hadn't cut them lines!

So we're not arguing?

51:38.125 --> 51:39.250
So what are we doing?

51:43.458 --> 51:46.666
I'm going to gather supplies.

51:46.750 --> 51:50.291
I'll take you to Guelston,
and when I get back to the ship,

51:51.333 --> 51:53.125
we'll finish what we started.

51:55.666 --> 51:58.041
Don't… get killed out there.

Promise.

52:08.250 --> 52:09.083
All right.

I promise.

52:40.583 --> 52:41.833

52:42.666 --> 52:44.500
We can't stay out here.

52:45.708 --> 52:47.458
[Captain Crow] That thing took Jacob.

52:47.541 --> 52:50.333
And I want it dead same as you,

52:50.416 --> 52:53.125
but we'll founder if we don't get to port.

52:55.500 --> 52:58.458
She's making more water
than we can pump out.

52:58.541 --> 53:00.958
And the patch we fothered keeps slipping.

53:01.041 --> 53:04.000
If we stay out here much longer,
we'll be sunk.

It'll be Mukesh by thunder,
or the ocean floor.

53:22.041 --> 53:26.541
Would you be planning a visit
to Gwen Batterbie, by any chance?

53:28.500 --> 53:32.250
Captain, her wares come
at too steep a price.

53:32.333 --> 53:36.458
To make covenant with the likes of her
is against the hunter's code.

53:36.541 --> 53:39.083
Blast whatever code
would bar me my revenge!

53:39.666 --> 53:41.916
There be no charter over me own.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.750
I'll use Batterbie's methods.
I'll do whatever it takes.

53:45.833 --> 53:47.916
I'd cleave the very sea

53:48.000 --> 53:52.625
and destroy everything that swims,
scuttles, or bobs if I have to.

53:53.208 --> 53:54.791
But I'll have vengeance.

53:56.791 --> 53:59.708
I'll have vengeance.

55:51.541 --> 55:52.375
[Maisie] I, uh…

55:53.333 --> 55:56.625
I'm afraid anything I say will upset you.

55:56.708 --> 55:58.666
You're probably right.

55:58.750 --> 56:00.958
Just don't move.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.000
[Maisie] I'm sorry,

56:05.500 --> 56:07.416
but I've always wanted a pet.

56:07.500 --> 56:09.416
That's not a pet.

56:09.500 --> 56:12.458
It's a monster, and we're not keeping it.

56:12.541 --> 56:14.375
But I already named it.

56:14.458 --> 56:15.291
Let me guess.

56:15.791 --> 56:16.791
Blue.

56:17.458 --> 56:18.583
[Maisie groans]

56:18.666 --> 56:20.916
You named that one Red.
You named this one Blue.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.458
We stay much longer, and we'll have
a rainbow of critters that wanna eat us.

56:24.541 --> 56:26.208
But he's so cute!

56:26.291 --> 56:27.750
Look at this face.

56:29.000 --> 56:32.166
You and I have a different idea of cute.

and you can name it Grey or White.

56:42.333 --> 56:43.541
Ginger, if you like.

56:43.625 --> 56:45.333
You're too young to be this mean.

56:45.416 --> 56:49.000
And you're too old
to be giving in to childish temptations.

56:49.083 --> 56:51.250
It ain't childish to want a pet.

56:51.333 --> 56:52.916
Lots of people have pets.

56:53.000 --> 56:55.166
Not pets that will lay eggs in your mouth

56:55.250 --> 56:57.916

through your chest cavity!

56:58.583 --> 57:01.958
That is so specific.

Well, I seen some things, all right?

Point is we don't know what he'd do.

Hold the rudder.

If we can make it to Rum Pepper Island,
we'll be able to flag a ship.

The Dregmorr is thick with monsters,
but don't worry.

within a mile of us, I'll sense it.

[bell rings]

1:08:16.875 --> 1:08:17.708
Captain!

1:08:18.708 --> 1:08:21.916
We don't need this. We're hunters.

1:08:22.458 --> 1:08:23.750
Only if we kill it.

1:08:25.625 --> 1:08:27.625
[ominous music continues]

1:08:34.125 --> 1:08:36.125
[ominous music fades]

1:08:53.708 --> 1:08:57.250
[Gwen] I know why you're here, Captain.

1:08:57.791 --> 1:09:01.333
It's always the same reason, you see.

1:09:03.125 --> 1:09:06.541
And I can give you what you need.

1:09:07.333 --> 1:09:13.291
A poison powerful enough
to take down the greatest of beasts,

1:09:13.375 --> 1:09:18.041
and a weapon strong enough
to deliver it deep.

1:09:20.458 --> 1:09:24.041
You know what they say about me, Captain?

1:09:24.666 --> 1:09:29.500
Them what come see Gwen Batterbie
get what they want,

1:09:29.583 --> 1:09:33.083
but won't see a good day after.

1:09:34.083 --> 1:09:36.500
Yet, here you are.

1:09:36.583 --> 1:09:39.083
I don't believe in them superstitions.

1:09:40.083 --> 1:09:43.125
No, I don't suppose you do.

1:09:45.583 --> 1:09:47.291
But you will.

1:09:51.375 --> 1:09:54.375
It's me most terrible creation.

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:58.541
The Hand of God, I calls it.

1:09:59.458 --> 1:10:00.708
What will it cost me?

1:10:01.208 --> 1:10:02.750
Everything, Captain.

1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:06.291
I take everything.

1:10:08.166 --> 1:10:11.458
So, do we have a deal?

1:13:01.750 --> 1:13:02.750
[Maisie sighs]

1:13:03.500 --> 1:13:06.208
It says here that during the dark times,

1:13:06.291 --> 1:13:09.333
the beast destroyed a town
on the coast of Kra' Zoul.

1:13:09.416 --> 1:13:13.666
But we been up and down that coast,
and I ain't never seen no town,

1:13:13.750 --> 1:13:15.500
destroyed or otherwise.

1:13:16.583 --> 1:13:19.541
A-And… And we don't say "yar"
half this much.

1:13:19.625 --> 1:13:21.958
E-Every other page, we're shouting "yar."

1:13:22.041 --> 1:13:24.250
I mean, this is just nonsense.

1:13:24.333 --> 1:13:25.583
Says you.

1:13:26.541 --> 1:13:28.333
But the book says otherwise,

1:13:28.833 --> 1:13:31.625
and it's going to outlast both of us.

1:13:31.708 --> 1:13:36.166
So people will believe
the beasts destroy towns that don't exist,

1:13:36.875 --> 1:13:38.916
and hunters like to say "yar."

1:13:42.875 --> 1:13:44.166
But if that ain't true,

1:13:45.916 --> 1:13:48.166
then how are you supposed to know what is?

1:13:48.250 --> 1:13:49.875
[Maisie] And how do we know the sea beasts

1:13:49.958 --> 1:13:52.750
ever plucked ladies
out of their veggie patches?

1:13:53.250 --> 1:13:56.083
That there really were the dark times?

1:13:57.333 --> 1:13:59.833
Maybe they didn't start this war.

1:14:02.333 --> 1:14:03.166
Maybe, but

1:14:03.916 --> 1:14:05.083
why would we?

1:14:05.916 --> 1:14:08.041
[thunder rumbles]

1:15:11.375 --> 1:15:12.291
Aye.

1:15:12.791 --> 1:15:13.916
Nicer down here.

[tranquil music continues]

1:16:10.166 --> 1:16:12.791
I don't know how the war started.

1:16:15.916 --> 1:16:19.333
Maybe all that matters is how it ends.

1:16:23.958 --> 1:16:25.958

It's a blood moon.

1:16:46.041 --> 1:16:47.291
Batterbie's watching.

1:16:47.833 --> 1:16:50.750
Honor is the currency of hunters, it is.

1:16:50.833 --> 1:16:54.333
And dealing with her ain't honorable.

1:16:54.416 --> 1:16:56.333
Aye. There'll be a payment due,

1:16:56.416 --> 1:16:59.375
and it's the ship
and all aboard who'll suffer the cost.

1:17:00.208 --> 1:17:01.291
[Captain Crow] Sarah!

1:17:05.375 --> 1:17:06.375
Look there.

1:17:08.125 --> 1:17:12.666
[squealing]

1:17:12.750 --> 1:17:14.333
Riddlebacks.

1:17:14.416 --> 1:17:15.375
Aye.

1:17:15.875 --> 1:17:17.708
They don't come this far north.

1:17:18.750 --> 1:17:21.125
Not unless they're swimming
away from something.

1:17:21.958 --> 1:17:25.416
And there's only one thing
what scares a riddleback.

1:17:25.500 --> 1:17:26.875
The Bluster.

1:17:27.500 --> 1:17:29.500

1:17:34.708 --> 1:17:37.625
[creatures shriek]

1:17:37.708 --> 1:17:40.958
Ms. Merino, shape a new course.
Due south, if you please.

1:17:41.041 --> 1:17:42.708
Alee of Rum Pepper Island.

1:17:42.791 --> 1:17:47.000
Aye, captain.
You heard him! Get it off the pins!

1:17:47.583 --> 1:17:49.083
Haul away now!

1:17:49.166 --> 1:17:50.791
Haul away, all!

1:17:50.875 --> 1:17:52.375
[ominous music continues]

1:17:52.458 --> 1:17:53.583
We'll find you.

1:17:54.625 --> 1:17:56.500
We'll find you soon enough.

1:17:59.208 --> 1:18:01.250
[Red growls softly]

1:18:12.333 --> 1:18:13.708
That ain't you no more.

1:18:14.625 --> 1:18:17.500
You're not Jacob Holland
who killed four of them beasts

1:18:17.583 --> 1:18:19.166
in a span of two days.

1:18:19.250 --> 1:18:20.125
It was five.

1:18:20.208 --> 1:18:23.416
You're Jacob Holland
who befriended a beast,

1:18:23.500 --> 1:18:24.750
saved me life,

1:18:24.833 --> 1:18:28.416
and led us all the way
to Rum Pepper Island.

1:18:29.208 --> 1:18:30.125
[Maisie giggles]

1:18:30.833 --> 1:18:32.041
We made it.

1:18:32.666 --> 1:18:35.125
[uplifting music playing]

1:18:37.750 --> 1:18:39.500
This is as far as Red goes.

1:18:40.250 --> 1:18:42.500
Won't be safe for her beyond the Dregmorr,

1:18:42.583 --> 1:18:44.166
but we can flag a passing ship.

1:18:45.708 --> 1:18:46.583
And then what?

1:18:48.208 --> 1:18:51.208
Well, then I'll, uh,
take you to Guelston, won't I?

1:18:53.625 --> 1:18:56.125
And what about you?

1:18:58.458 --> 1:18:59.416
[sighs]

1:19:06.583 --> 1:19:08.208
Guelston is a place.

1:19:08.291 --> 1:19:09.875
It ain't a family.

1:19:10.666 --> 1:19:14.625
I ain't going back there,
and you ain't going back on that ship.

1:19:14.708 --> 1:19:17.166
So all you have is me.

1:19:18.541 --> 1:19:20.125
And all I have is you.

1:19:21.291 --> 1:19:22.958
And that don't sound so bad.

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.166
So, what do you say?

1:19:33.708 --> 1:19:34.875
Should we give it a go?

1:19:36.666 --> 1:19:37.541
You mean, uh…

1:19:38.583 --> 1:19:39.791
You mean, like a family?

1:19:40.666 --> 1:19:41.500
Sure.

1:19:42.416 --> 1:19:43.458
I-I don't know.

1:19:44.583 --> 1:19:49.666
Maybe if we pretend long enough,
it could feel real?

1:19:53.166 --> 1:19:55.416
Never mind. It's stupid.

1:19:56.458 --> 1:19:58.875
What, are you picturing us on a farm
or something?

1:19:58.958 --> 1:20:00.916
I said "never mind," ya donkey.

1:20:01.666 --> 1:20:02.708
So never mind.

1:20:03.958 --> 1:20:05.750
It's just I-I don't think I'm--

1:20:05.833 --> 1:20:07.750
You got something in your ears?

1:20:07.833 --> 1:20:09.208
All right, all right.

1:20:15.333 --> 1:20:18.708
Well, guess, uh, we'd better pack up.

Well, girl, this has been
an improbable adventure.

1:20:42.791 --> 1:20:45.291
And I thank you
for all you've done, but, uh,

1:20:46.625 --> 1:20:47.958
it's time to go home now.

1:20:58.250 --> 1:21:02.416
And I promise
I'll never hunt sea monsters again.

1:21:02.916 --> 1:21:05.916
No more monster hunting!

Hang about.

1:21:18.333 --> 1:21:19.500
[panting] Okay.

1:21:20.208 --> 1:21:21.458
No more!

1:21:21.541 --> 1:21:23.416
[groans]

No more! [grunts]

[yells] Ow!

1:21:28.625 --> 1:21:29.458
Jeez!

1:21:30.875 --> 1:21:35.125
[sighs] Look, you understand
the point I'm trying to make here, right?

1:21:35.208 --> 1:21:36.833
It's a… It's a symbolic gesture.

[Jacob] Red, listen to me.

1:23:02.583 --> 1:23:04.000
Just leave.

1:23:04.083 --> 1:23:05.750
This doesn't have to be a fight.

1:23:05.833 --> 1:23:07.333

1:23:07.416 --> 1:23:09.333

-[Jacob] No, Red. Go.

1:23:14.125 --> 1:23:18.250

[Jacob and Maisie grunt]

1:23:35.083 --> 1:23:37.208

1:24:07.958 --> 1:24:08.958
[Jacob] Maisie!

1:24:10.500 --> 1:24:11.791
Are you all right, lass?

1:24:12.833 --> 1:24:14.541
Is Red okay?

1:24:15.333 --> 1:24:17.000
[tense music continues]

1:24:17.625 --> 1:24:18.791
Hold fast!

Stay back, beast. Leave her be.

1:25:33.208 --> 1:25:34.458
[Red growls]

1:25:35.083 --> 1:25:36.250
It's the Red Bluster.

1:25:36.916 --> 1:25:38.250
The beast is delivered!

1:25:38.750 --> 1:25:39.708

1:25:46.875 --> 1:25:48.541
[Maisie strains]

1:25:48.625 --> 1:25:49.625
No, lass.

1:25:50.875 --> 1:25:52.500
There's nothing to be done.

1:25:53.333 --> 1:25:55.166
She doesn't have to do this.

1:25:59.375 --> 1:26:01.583
Yes, she does.

1:26:01.666 --> 1:26:03.458
[ominous music playing]

1:26:22.291 --> 1:26:24.291
[tense music continues]

1:26:42.833 --> 1:26:44.416
[Captain Crow] Now is the reckoning.

1:26:46.916 --> 1:26:49.791
For all who've been lost,

1:26:49.875 --> 1:26:52.666
I strike at thee, devil!

1:26:57.500 --> 1:26:59.583

1:27:16.458 --> 1:27:18.458
[sad music playing]

1:27:31.500 --> 1:27:32.375
Don't fight.

1:27:32.958 --> 1:27:35.083
You'll make the poison flow faster.

1:27:35.583 --> 1:27:38.708
I don't want you to die. Not yet.

1:27:38.791 --> 1:27:42.541
Not till you've been immortalized
at Castle Whiterock.

1:27:43.041 --> 1:27:44.458
[sailors strain]

1:27:44.541 --> 1:27:48.291
[Red growls]

1:27:49.833 --> 1:27:53.750
Captain, might be wiser
to let the poison finish the job.

1:27:53.833 --> 1:27:54.791
No, Sarah.

1:27:55.416 --> 1:27:57.541
I made a promise to the king and queen.

1:27:58.416 --> 1:28:00.250
[sailors strain]

1:28:00.333 --> 1:28:03.500

1:28:05.833 --> 1:28:10.583
[indistinct chatter]

1:28:16.083 --> 1:28:17.166
But I'd not worry.

1:28:17.708 --> 1:28:19.541
There's no fight left in it.

1:28:19.625 --> 1:28:21.625
[tense music playing]

1:28:23.416 --> 1:28:24.958
Yes, there is.

1:28:26.625 --> 1:28:28.791
[indistinct shouting]

1:28:29.375 --> 1:28:30.291
[Sarah grunts]

1:28:31.708 --> 1:28:33.791
Raise the studding sails!

1:28:33.875 --> 1:28:36.208
To starboard, Captain. It's a boat!

1:28:36.875 --> 1:28:38.041
Hold!

1:28:38.125 --> 1:28:40.250
[dramatic music crescendos]

1:28:44.208 --> 1:28:45.416
By the powers…

1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:46.833
Jacob.

1:28:47.833 --> 1:28:49.833
[dramatic music playing]

1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:55.958
[dramatic music fades]

1:29:04.333 --> 1:29:05.875

1:29:08.166 --> 1:29:13.500
[breathes shallowly]

1:29:24.083 --> 1:29:25.166
[Captain Crow] I see.

1:29:26.041 --> 1:29:27.666
That's quite a story, Jacob.

1:29:29.125 --> 1:29:32.166
The hunter what befriended a beast. Hmm.

1:29:34.125 --> 1:29:36.250
The beast what took me deadlight.

1:29:37.416 --> 1:29:39.041
What am I to make of ye, Jacob?

1:29:40.250 --> 1:29:42.708
That thing and I,

1:29:43.458 --> 1:29:44.583
we, uh, had, uh,

1:29:46.541 --> 1:29:47.708
an understanding.

1:29:47.791 --> 1:29:49.458
A truce. Hmm?

1:29:50.458 --> 1:29:52.791
But there cannot be a truce without war.

1:29:53.291 --> 1:29:59.375
Whatever happened out there is nothing
against hundreds of years of war.

1:30:02.833 --> 1:30:04.541
I've always known what I was, Jacob.

1:30:04.625 --> 1:30:07.541
I'm the son of a captain,
who was the son of a captain.

1:30:07.625 --> 1:30:12.083
And if we are born to fight,
then by God, let's fight.

1:30:12.166 --> 1:30:17.458
That we may be tested
and find our greatness.

1:30:18.000 --> 1:30:21.000
So I ask you, Jacob, my son,

1:30:21.833 --> 1:30:24.333
are you my enemy?

1:30:24.416 --> 1:30:26.208
[tense music playing]

1:30:28.708 --> 1:30:30.291
[Maisie grunts]

1:30:30.375 --> 1:30:32.291
-[Jacob] Maisie, stop!

1:30:32.375 --> 1:30:33.291
[Maisie coughs]

1:30:35.083 --> 1:30:36.416
Let her go!

1:30:37.500 --> 1:30:38.625
[chuckles]

1:30:39.333 --> 1:30:41.083
She's all vinegar.

1:30:45.583 --> 1:30:48.458
Easy, lass. Easy. There you go.

1:30:51.583 --> 1:30:53.791
You need to help Red.

1:30:53.875 --> 1:30:55.666
She's our friend.

1:30:56.541 --> 1:30:57.791
I'm sorry.

1:30:57.875 --> 1:30:59.958
[breathes weakly]

1:31:00.041 --> 1:31:01.250
She needs her rest.

1:31:01.916 --> 1:31:03.416
I'll get you back to Guelston.

1:31:05.041 --> 1:31:06.000
You'll be safe.

1:31:06.583 --> 1:31:09.125
You'll have a good, long life.

1:31:10.541 --> 1:31:13.208
But first, we'll pay a visit
to Castle Whiterock.

1:31:13.916 --> 1:31:16.000
We have a date with the king and queen.

1:31:16.083 --> 1:31:17.791
[sad music playing]

1:31:17.875 --> 1:31:19.875
Jacob, I imagine you could use a drink.

1:31:21.583 --> 1:31:23.583
[sad music continues]

1:31:34.875 --> 1:31:36.333
[sailor] Welcome home, lad.

1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:38.000
Good to see ya.

1:31:38.791 --> 1:31:39.875
So good to see you.

1:31:39.958 --> 1:31:42.000
[sad music continues]

1:31:48.500 --> 1:31:49.958
[Captain Crow] You're home, Jacob.

1:31:50.041 --> 1:31:53.458
Let's toast to the many adventures
that lay ahead of you,

1:31:53.541 --> 1:31:55.791

1:32:19.458 --> 1:32:21.125
You're getting your strength back.

1:32:22.208 --> 1:32:23.125
Too late.

1:32:24.583 --> 1:32:25.416
Maybe.

1:32:27.583 --> 1:32:29.916
It's not right what they're doing to Red.

1:32:30.000 --> 1:32:31.458
She saved us.

1:32:31.541 --> 1:32:34.375
You have to believe me, please.

1:32:36.958 --> 1:32:37.916
I believe you.

1:32:38.500 --> 1:32:40.291
Then help me stop them.

1:32:41.666 --> 1:32:45.375
I've been fighting them beasts
all me life,

1:32:45.458 --> 1:32:49.166
and I've seen things
that will never go away.

1:32:50.208 --> 1:32:52.041
This ship is all I know.

1:32:54.375 --> 1:32:58.458

The whole world will know
what we've done, me boy.

1:33:47.875 --> 1:33:51.416
This ship, your ship, will live on.

1:33:52.416 --> 1:33:54.000
Nothing can stop it.

Why is everyone… [gasps]

1:35:56.500 --> 1:35:59.291

Well, it looks like we have our winner.

1:36:28.291 --> 1:36:30.750
When I last visited Whiterock,

1:36:30.833 --> 1:36:35.791
you told me
that the days of hunters were over.

1:36:35.875 --> 1:36:39.666
But the Imperator
was no match for the beast.

1:36:50.375 --> 1:36:53.041
All of your wealth and power,

1:36:53.125 --> 1:36:58.916
all of this is nothing
compared to a hunter's fury.

1:37:02.083 --> 1:37:03.500

1:37:04.125 --> 1:37:07.291
And it's the Inevitable
what will lead the way

1:37:08.333 --> 1:37:10.875
into the Dregmorr and beyond.

1:37:10.958 --> 1:37:12.958
[tense music continues]
