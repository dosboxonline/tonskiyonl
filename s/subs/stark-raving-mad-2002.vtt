loud as hell upstairs.

in it and wires that go up.

And over here is a air duct,

is right behind the fuse box.

01:03:16.365 --> 01:03:19.735

made it very loud upstairs
when the surges happened.

some overtime in on this.

for the kitchen in the morning.

to deliver the Chinese food
and saw everything.

-I couldn't let him go.

What was the truth you told her
to get her to leave?

went Kevin's way either.

expect you until 5:00.

That's fine by me, but

won't have much of a choice
if I have the statue, will he?

rips open its chest...

with the fucking cash?

01:33:35.483 --> 01:33:38.018
Cash? Me? What are you
talking about?

01:33:38.052 --> 01:33:41.122
There was $2 million
in there!
Kiss my ass!

01:33:41.155 --> 01:33:46.827
Look! I don't know
what the fuck's going on here,

01:33:46.861 --> 01:33:50.131
but I do know that you two guys
are in a bank vault,

01:33:50.164 --> 01:33:54.568
there's a hole in the wall,
safes are blown, shit's missing.

01:33:54.602 --> 01:33:57.872
You gotta trust me
on this one, guys.

01:33:57.905 --> 01:34:02.510
You're gonna go down.
Now get 'em outta here.

01:34:07.481 --> 01:34:10.017
[ Ben Narrating ]
Wanna hear something great?

01:34:10.050 --> 01:34:14.088
That was Gregory's laundered
money we took from the safe,
kept there under an alias.

01:34:14.121 --> 01:34:18.359
[ Laughs ]
The fucker got arrested
for stealing from himself.

01:34:18.392 --> 01:34:20.561
Couldn't do anything about it.

01:34:20.594 --> 01:34:23.197
The feds have been trying
to nail him for a long time,

01:34:23.230 --> 01:34:25.432
and this is just
what they were waiting for.

01:34:25.466 --> 01:34:30.037
Twenty years in Leavenworth,
suckin' dick for cigarettes.

01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:33.207
And Jin Sun?
He was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time,

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:35.242
and the feds
tagged him too.

01:34:35.276 --> 01:34:37.978
Gregory still blames him
for everything.

01:34:38.012 --> 01:34:41.048
You know, Jin Sun
would have walked away clean
if he hadn't tried to fuck me.

01:34:41.081 --> 01:34:44.185
[ Speaking Chinese ]

01:35:00.534 --> 01:35:04.138
The night turned out to be
a pretty good night after all.

01:35:04.171 --> 01:35:08.609
One of those memories that's
better after the fact than
when it's actually happening.

01:35:08.642 --> 01:35:12.613
I mean, I got the money,
I got revenge...

01:35:12.646 --> 01:35:14.548
and nobody got killed.

01:35:14.582 --> 01:35:17.484
Hell, Rikki even got laid.

01:35:17.518 --> 01:35:20.387
As a matter of fact,
I got everything I wanted.

01:35:20.421 --> 01:35:22.957
Even the girl.

01:35:25.059 --> 01:35:27.561
Okay, maybe not the girl.

01:35:27.595 --> 01:35:30.130
But everything else.
