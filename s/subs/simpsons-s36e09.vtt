09:22.454 --> 09:23.636
is you!

09:23.713 --> 09:24.637
[all gasp]

09:24.639 --> 09:25.638
Me?

09:25.640 --> 09:27.123
How can I be the problem?

09:27.125 --> 09:28.958
I'm the Marge of this!

09:28.960 --> 09:30.460
Oh, please.

09:30.462 --> 09:32.553
If you actually wanted peace,

09:32.631 --> 09:34.314
you'd stop interfering.

09:34.466 --> 09:37.150
Let these three lunatics
work out their mishegoss

09:37.226 --> 09:38.743
among themselves.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.654
Why on earth
would I want them to fight?

09:41.731 --> 09:43.323
So you could be the martyr.

09:43.325 --> 09:46.567
You keep them separated
so they<i> won't</i> stop fighting.

09:46.569 --> 09:49.254
God forbid they should ever bury
the hatchet and, who knows...

09:49.331 --> 09:50.830
[chuckles]
become friends.

09:50.907 --> 09:54.818
Because then St. Marge
doesn't get to run the show.

09:54.820 --> 09:56.243
-[Marge] Aah!
-[clattering]
-[Santa's Little Helper howls]

09:56.263 --> 09:57.262
-[Lisa] Hey!
-[glass shatters]
-[Snowball II yowls]

09:57.264 --> 09:58.597
[Marge]
Lamp. [grunts]

09:58.599 --> 10:01.415
That's the craziest thing
I ever heard!

10:01.417 --> 10:02.508
I'm the nicest!

10:02.585 --> 10:03.918
I love everyone!

10:03.995 --> 10:06.104
Out! Out! Out, out! Get out!

10:06.181 --> 10:08.607
I un-sign all the waivers!

10:08.683 --> 10:10.500
Shh, shoo, shoo, shoo!

10:10.502 --> 10:14.520
This is what showbiz is
all about, huh, Wayne the Grip?

10:14.597 --> 10:15.505
The camaraderie.

10:15.507 --> 10:16.597
Huh? Why do you know my name?

10:16.675 --> 10:18.174
Please don't fire me.

10:18.176 --> 10:21.194
I need to support my stepson's
illegal street racing habit.

10:21.196 --> 10:23.622
Relax, my fruit-vaping friend.

10:23.624 --> 10:24.956
I'm just like you--

10:25.033 --> 10:27.367
a member of the crew family.

10:27.443 --> 10:29.461
Really? You always seemed
like you couldn't stand

10:29.537 --> 10:30.945
us below-the-line guys.

10:30.947 --> 10:32.613
[groans]
What I can't stand

10:32.691 --> 10:35.041
is that old-fashioned
Hollywood expression.

10:35.118 --> 10:38.044
Why should there be
some imaginary line separating

10:38.046 --> 10:39.379
the so-called "talent"

10:39.531 --> 10:41.622
from the hardworking riffraff
like you?

10:41.642 --> 10:46.144
If I could, I'd make it
so the line never existed.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.129
[chuckles]
That's pretty cool of you, man.

10:48.131 --> 10:51.541
You know, I'm hosting a crawfish
boil this weekend for the crew.

10:51.543 --> 10:52.709
You should come.

10:52.711 --> 10:54.711
You're inviting me

10:54.713 --> 10:56.637
to your that?

10:56.639 --> 10:58.156
Just watch out
for my friend Jimmy.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.808
He will flick you in the nuts
if you're not looking.

11:00.886 --> 11:03.386
I look forward to it.

11:03.388 --> 11:06.389
Where does that judgmental
old clown-aunt

11:06.391 --> 11:08.333
get off saying I'm the problem?

11:08.410 --> 11:11.077
How can I be the reason
you three don't get along?

11:11.229 --> 11:12.912
[chuckles]
That lady's off her rocker.

11:12.989 --> 11:14.321
Thank you, sweetie.

11:14.399 --> 11:16.916
You always know
how to agree with me.

11:16.993 --> 11:19.260
Yes, I do.

11:20.572 --> 11:22.422
[scoffs]
As if there were a world

11:22.498 --> 11:25.499
where I'd be friends
with my worst enemies.

11:25.501 --> 11:30.355
<i> Hmm. Friends with Patty</i>
<i> and Selma.</i>

11:45.597 --> 11:47.688
<i>What are you doing here, Homer?</i>

11:47.766 --> 11:48.781
<i> This isn't you.</i>

11:48.875 --> 11:51.167
<i> You're not this person.</i>

11:51.937 --> 11:53.770
So, here we all are.

11:53.772 --> 11:56.606
If I could have stayed away,
I would have.

11:56.624 --> 11:58.107
Part of me wants to run.

11:58.109 --> 12:00.201
Part of me knows
I'm through running.

12:01.370 --> 12:04.464
Do you think there's any truth
to what the mean lady said,

12:04.616 --> 12:08.301
that we would be friends
if not for Marge?

12:08.303 --> 12:10.303
I know I don't want
to believe it.

12:10.379 --> 12:12.622
We need to figure out
if this is real.

12:12.624 --> 12:15.549
I know a place where
we can explore these feelings

12:15.627 --> 12:17.977
discreetly.

12:18.054 --> 12:21.197
Patty and Selma,
welcome to Moe's.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.151
Weird how the sunlight stops
at the doorway,

12:25.228 --> 12:26.970
like it's afraid to come in.

12:26.972 --> 12:29.748
Yeah, a scientist tried
to explain it one time

12:29.750 --> 12:31.207
and went crazy.

12:32.143 --> 12:33.493
[Moe]
Homer. Psst. Homer.

12:33.569 --> 12:36.162
Hey, I said "Psst."

12:36.239 --> 12:38.757
Who are these two goddesses?

12:38.833 --> 12:40.074
They're Marge's sisters.

12:40.151 --> 12:43.077
Midge has two hotter sisters?

12:43.154 --> 12:44.988
Patty and Selma.

12:44.990 --> 12:46.097
Pidge and Sidge?

12:46.174 --> 12:48.082
Well, yeah, they're twins.

12:48.159 --> 12:49.993
Oh, my God. Twins?

12:49.995 --> 12:51.752
I always dreamed of hooking up
with twins.

12:51.830 --> 12:55.589
Ever since I saw that old
commercial for the movie<i> Twins.</i>

12:55.667 --> 12:57.275
Patty's a lesbian,
so I don't think--

12:57.352 --> 13:00.094
And one of 'em has
zero interest in men?

13:00.113 --> 13:02.096
I think I'm in love over here.

13:02.098 --> 13:03.523
How could you keep this from me?

13:03.599 --> 13:04.741
How could you do it?

13:09.697 --> 13:12.290
[all murmuring]

13:12.367 --> 13:15.868
All these years we treated
each other like garbage.

13:15.945 --> 13:17.611
But it was Marge's fault.

13:17.689 --> 13:21.132
I hope we can find it
in ourselves to forgive her.

13:21.209 --> 13:23.951
Seeing as we're such great
people, we probably will.

13:24.029 --> 13:27.263
To the three... amigos?

13:28.366 --> 13:32.793
Four. You're so fat,
you count twice.

13:32.871 --> 13:34.053
Zing!

13:34.130 --> 13:35.872
-[all laughing]
-Twice.

13:35.874 --> 13:39.225
Said the spinster with
a toilet brush for a head.

13:39.302 --> 13:40.819
Zing!

13:40.895 --> 13:42.061
[all laughing]

13:42.063 --> 13:43.379
-Good one.
-Now that we're buddies,

13:43.381 --> 13:47.075
our horrible insults
are just delightful zings.

13:48.644 --> 13:50.720
Look, Homer, it's your head.

13:50.738 --> 13:52.722
It's even got your IQ.

13:52.724 --> 13:53.814
Zing!

13:53.892 --> 13:55.816
[metallic scraping]

13:55.894 --> 14:00.821
[Homer straining]
It's like I'm being crushed
by two sacks of wet mail.

14:00.823 --> 14:02.757
[Patty and Selma]
Zing!

14:05.011 --> 14:06.919
Did you have to audition
for this part

14:06.921 --> 14:08.921
or did your agent
just get a call?

14:08.923 --> 14:10.473
[whispers]
Zing.

14:11.743 --> 14:14.594
38 minutes. No hints.

14:14.670 --> 14:16.670
I stayed out of the way.

14:16.748 --> 14:18.005
Homer?

14:18.083 --> 14:19.432
[all yelp]
Marge!

14:19.434 --> 14:23.252
[muffled] Dad, are you hanging
out with Patty and Selma?

14:23.254 --> 14:25.512
-[laughing nervously]
-No, the thing is...

14:25.514 --> 14:27.348
It seems like you guys
are friends.

14:27.425 --> 14:29.534
-[stammering nervously]
-Wh-Why would I...

14:29.611 --> 14:33.520
If you guys are getting along
without me,

14:33.598 --> 14:35.781
the problem<i> is</i> me.

14:35.783 --> 14:37.625
[clangs]

14:43.049 --> 14:44.790
-Open. Open.
-[munching]

14:44.867 --> 14:45.884
Friends.

14:45.886 --> 14:47.201
[Patty]
Unlikely friends.

14:47.203 --> 14:49.053
[Homer]
Remember, no splashing.

14:49.130 --> 14:50.889
-[water splashing]
-[laughing] Oh, no.

14:51.040 --> 14:53.633
Mom, you should go down
and join them.

14:53.635 --> 14:55.118
No, I'd only cause trouble

14:55.136 --> 14:56.877
because I'm the problem.

14:56.955 --> 14:57.729
[worried grunt]

14:57.805 --> 15:00.123
Of course you're not.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.882
No, I am. It's fine, though.

15:01.960 --> 15:04.218
Your father and my sisters
getting along was my dream

15:04.295 --> 15:05.962
and it happened
and now my life is perfect.

15:05.964 --> 15:07.463
Hooray for TV therapy.

15:07.482 --> 15:08.764
Hooray, hooray, hooray.

15:08.800 --> 15:10.724
So perfect that you're up here
watching them

15:10.802 --> 15:13.970
while you refold laundry
that's already been folded.

15:13.972 --> 15:16.656
Maybe I don't do things right
the first time.

15:16.732 --> 15:18.750
Or any time.

15:18.826 --> 15:19.976
[Marge groaning]

15:19.978 --> 15:22.253
Bart! Mom has candy!

15:22.330 --> 15:24.238
Candy, candy, candy,
candy, candy.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.757
[groaning continues]

15:25.759 --> 15:27.425
[sobbing]

15:27.502 --> 15:30.503
I ruined everything.

15:30.579 --> 15:33.389
Candy?

15:34.492 --> 15:36.100
[tires screech]

15:37.586 --> 15:40.229
[groans]

15:41.683 --> 15:43.924
Krusty, you made it.

15:43.926 --> 15:46.110
Like I'm not gonna
drive three hours

15:46.112 --> 15:48.504
to be with my crew family.

15:48.506 --> 15:51.524
You got a little water prison
for the kids. Nice.

15:51.526 --> 15:52.842
Oh, it's a pool.

15:52.844 --> 15:55.845
No, pools go in the ground.

15:55.847 --> 15:57.196
Oh, you got to meet
my neighbors.

15:57.198 --> 15:58.848
That's Phil. He's a cop.

15:58.850 --> 15:59.940
Joe, cop.

16:00.018 --> 16:01.851
Uh, cop, cop, cop.

16:01.853 --> 16:04.370
Uh, I love law enforcement.

16:04.372 --> 16:05.964
And laws.

16:07.116 --> 16:09.041
Hey! Little help, K-dawg?

16:09.118 --> 16:10.710
Oh! I can do this.

16:10.786 --> 16:12.862
I bet on this sport.

16:12.864 --> 16:14.547
[grunts]

16:14.623 --> 16:17.049
[guests gasping]

16:17.051 --> 16:18.792
[children screaming]

16:18.870 --> 16:21.795
[crying]

16:21.873 --> 16:24.232
Walk it off, Jayden.
Walk it off.

16:27.320 --> 16:31.047
The dunes
are calling your name, bro!

16:31.049 --> 16:32.898
[grunting]

16:32.975 --> 16:34.975
-[laughter]
-[cheering]

16:35.053 --> 16:36.494
My stepson's stepson,

16:36.571 --> 16:38.663
he built this baby out
of boat parts!

16:38.740 --> 16:42.333
So, no brakes or safety features
to weigh you down.

16:42.410 --> 16:44.227
Smart.

16:44.229 --> 16:45.319
Is there a helmet?

16:45.396 --> 16:48.064
Statistically,
you're safer without one.

16:48.066 --> 16:49.823
Got to do your own research.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.917
Okay, I can do this.

16:51.919 --> 16:54.512
Just take it slow and steady.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.758
-[yelps]
-[crashes]

16:58.760 --> 17:00.910
Hey, the CPR worked!

17:00.912 --> 17:03.670
And when your heart stopped,
which heaven did you see?

17:03.748 --> 17:07.191
Jet Ski paintball next weekend
at Concrete Lake, K-dawg!

17:07.268 --> 17:08.084
You in?

17:08.086 --> 17:10.361
Wouldn't miss it.

17:12.423 --> 17:13.773
[announcer]
<i> It's</i> The Problem Is You

17:13.849 --> 17:16.776
Season Finale Reunion Special!

17:16.852 --> 17:18.703
[cheering, applause]

17:19.764 --> 17:21.097
Welcome!

17:21.099 --> 17:24.691
On our first hit season,
we solved a lot of problems.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.026
And here they are now!

17:26.104 --> 17:27.286
[audience cheers]

17:27.363 --> 17:29.622
So, how's everybody doing?

17:30.625 --> 17:32.958
Yes, well, when you find out
that you're the problem,

17:33.035 --> 17:34.201
even though
you could have sworn--

17:34.279 --> 17:36.537
and I mean with every fiber
of your being--

17:36.614 --> 17:39.206
that it was the other guy,
it's very, well,

17:39.284 --> 17:41.375
I don't know, freeing?
I don't know.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.394
I was so controlling
of Percival.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.397
But now I just let him
roam free.

17:46.474 --> 17:49.383
Oh, Aunt Sadie,
you changed all our lives.

17:49.385 --> 17:53.145
Once you helped Marge step back
from decades of sabotaging us,

17:53.147 --> 17:54.964
it's been so good for her.

17:54.966 --> 17:56.741
-Right, honey?
-That's right.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.150
I'm gonna be honest.

17:58.227 --> 17:59.744
There was a time when I thought

17:59.895 --> 18:02.062
maybe we were doing
something wrong.

18:02.140 --> 18:04.865
But we were
completely blameless.

18:04.976 --> 18:06.267
Not me. I'm to blame.

18:06.344 --> 18:07.752
The problem is Marge.

18:07.829 --> 18:11.071
All those things that used to
bother me about Marge's sisters,

18:11.149 --> 18:12.665
they just don't anymore.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.258
I can remember, for example,

18:14.260 --> 18:15.985
when I wouldn't be able to stand

18:15.987 --> 18:18.078
the way he's breathing
right now.

18:18.156 --> 18:20.506
Oh. W-Was I breathing loud?

18:20.583 --> 18:21.340
I'm sorry.

18:21.417 --> 18:22.658
Doesn't bother me either.

18:22.660 --> 18:25.845
Good, because the cigarette ash
in your eyebrows

18:25.921 --> 18:26.920
doesn't bother me.

18:26.998 --> 18:28.272
I'm not sitting here, thinking,

18:28.349 --> 18:30.608
"How could there be
so much of it?"

18:30.759 --> 18:31.667
[Selma and Patty murmur]

18:31.686 --> 18:33.185
Kumiko, tell me,

18:33.262 --> 18:36.021
is your husband still skipping
the episode "previously on"s

18:36.098 --> 18:37.764
even though you find them
helpful?

18:37.766 --> 18:40.509
You want to know something else
that doesn't bother me?

18:40.511 --> 18:43.696
That he only cuts his
fingernails on his left hand.

18:43.772 --> 18:47.291
I'm a righty, so I can't use
the clippers with my left!

18:47.293 --> 18:51.036
Again, it doesn't bother us.

18:51.038 --> 18:52.688
[chuckling nervously]

18:52.690 --> 18:54.948
Marge, you want to step in here?

18:55.026 --> 18:56.467
You mean separate you?

18:56.544 --> 18:58.085
Oh, no. No, not me.

18:58.196 --> 19:00.596
I don't do that anymore.

19:06.128 --> 19:07.794
You disgust me!

19:07.872 --> 19:09.147
-Groom yourself!
-You first!

19:09.298 --> 19:12.208
You don't yell at
a reunion show, you sick morons!

19:12.210 --> 19:14.819
Look at these losers I cured.

19:14.896 --> 19:16.803
Cheapskate-- fixed!

19:16.805 --> 19:18.898
Daddy issues-- fixed!

19:18.974 --> 19:19.991
Impotent--

19:20.067 --> 19:21.717
came to terms with.

19:21.719 --> 19:23.219
[Kirk sighs]

19:23.221 --> 19:24.645
You fixed nothing!

19:24.664 --> 19:28.148
You plaster over real problems
with an easy catchphrase.

19:28.226 --> 19:31.243
These three have hated each
other since the moment they met,

19:31.245 --> 19:32.912
and all you did
was give them a reason

19:32.988 --> 19:34.955
to not feel guilty about it.

19:35.066 --> 19:37.566
Don't talk to me about guilt.

19:37.568 --> 19:39.010
I invented guilt!

19:39.086 --> 19:41.662
No! It's my turn to yell!

19:41.739 --> 19:43.739
And point and point and point!

19:43.741 --> 19:46.333
You can't solve relationships
in 30 minutes.

19:46.411 --> 19:49.520
It requires years
of constant hard work

19:49.597 --> 19:53.024
and deep self-reflection
from all parties!

19:53.100 --> 19:56.419
I didn't sign up
for self-reflection.

19:56.421 --> 19:58.771
Now you want me
to work at my marriage?

19:58.847 --> 20:00.013
Oh, I'm leaving you.

20:00.091 --> 20:01.941
And I'm taking the pugs!

20:02.093 --> 20:04.685
[overlapping arguing]

20:04.704 --> 20:06.262
I'm Marge Simpson,

20:06.280 --> 20:09.040
and the problem is not me.

20:09.191 --> 20:10.357
I see it now.

20:10.435 --> 20:12.117
The problem's not me either.

20:12.270 --> 20:15.046
I was wrong to try
to form human connections

20:15.197 --> 20:17.048
with the people
that work for me!

20:17.199 --> 20:19.458
Well, I don't think
that's the lesson.

20:19.460 --> 20:22.703
Why should I spend time
with anyone below the line?!

20:22.722 --> 20:24.871
The line is there for a reason.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.799
The line is an absolute good!

20:26.951 --> 20:29.209
The line is life!

20:29.287 --> 20:31.395
I always knew
that guy was a phony.

20:31.472 --> 20:34.899
Hey, let's go rub our butts
on his sushi.

20:35.050 --> 20:36.234
Don't you leave me!

20:36.310 --> 20:39.962
I've got an hour to fill
with you mental cases!

20:39.964 --> 20:42.365
[growls]

20:43.801 --> 20:47.078
You need my yelling!

20:50.399 --> 20:53.008
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Krusty.

20:53.010 --> 20:55.402
Who said you could talk to me?

20:55.480 --> 20:57.255
Oh! Here we go.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.739
That's Jimmy!
