21:51.560 --> 21:54.062
Oh, here he comes,
the attention whore.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.522
-Hey, Rome.
-ROMAN: Hello.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.315
-How you doin'?
-ROMAN: Oh. Wow.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.109
Thank you for asking. I'm great.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.986
It's just been
like a really great few days,

22:01.069 --> 22:02.779
actually, yeah. How about you?
How you doin'?

22:02.863 --> 22:04.698
-I feel pretty good.
-ROMAN: Hmm?

22:04.781 --> 22:07.034
Certain amount of regret,
but you know...

22:07.701 --> 22:09.327
pretty cleansed.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.787
ROMAN: "Cleansed"?
That's interesting.

22:10.871 --> 22:12.706
That's like,
really fucking interesting.

22:12.789 --> 22:15.167
I guess, we'll learn to know
how you're actually doing,

22:15.250 --> 22:16.918
gonna have to wait for you
to, you know,

22:17.002 --> 22:19.129
call a national
fucking press conference.

22:19.212 --> 22:22.841
And you be like,
"No, I said I was fine.

22:22.924 --> 22:27.429
But actually, I'm not fine.
Roman is a dick.

22:27.512 --> 22:30.807
And he didn't even bring me
anything from the airport,

22:30.891 --> 22:33.143
and now I feel bad."
I did, actually,

22:33.226 --> 22:35.103
I brought you those
Danish cinnamon things

22:35.187 --> 22:36.521
-from the wherever place.
-Oh, that's--

22:36.605 --> 22:39.024
-ROMAN: The-- the--
-That's sweet. That is so kind.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.400
-Thank you.
-ROMAN: Oh, oh, shut up.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.486
Just eat 'em or don't.
You're welcome.

22:46.698 --> 22:48.450
You take a look?

22:48.533 --> 22:51.411
-Oh. Yeah, fuck you.
-Yeah? Uh-huh?

22:51.495 --> 22:54.247
So, look, guys.
Can we clean-slate this?

22:54.331 --> 22:57.042
You didn't like how I did
what I did to Dad. Sure...

22:58.126 --> 22:59.377
whatever, I'm sorry.

23:00.087 --> 23:02.255
And that's for me and him.

23:02.339 --> 23:06.468
But here's the thing. He's over,
so let's work together

23:06.551 --> 23:08.804
to take over
and help him move on out.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.681
Um... Well...

23:11.765 --> 23:15.102
I'm just here
to spy on this one, so...

23:15.185 --> 23:17.687
And I'm just here to get you
to back down.

23:20.482 --> 23:21.733
-KENDALL: I'm sorry.
-Oh.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.610
I'm sorry, I wanna tell you
what a fucking prick you are,

23:23.693 --> 23:25.445
but can we do it
where we don't have to fold in

23:25.529 --> 23:27.614
-Rava's dog-walker?
-Yeah. Sorry. Yeah. Follow me.

23:28.949 --> 23:29.991

(MIMICS) "Uh, uh, Sophie!
Sophie's room."

23:39.209 --> 23:42.170
Hey, yeah, this is great.
Thank you. Five stars.

23:49.010 --> 23:52.639
Hey. Gramps.
Oh! Thanks for this.

23:52.722 --> 23:55.684
-EWAN ROY: Hmm.
-Big gramps in the big city.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.727
Hey, how you doin'?
W-- what are you doing here?

23:57.811 --> 24:00.272
I am putting my affairs
in order.

24:02.190 --> 24:03.525
Very nice. Very nice.

24:03.608 --> 24:06.820
EWAN: Your publicity-shy friend,
the shrinking violet,

24:06.903 --> 24:09.114
has been calling me.
What does he want?

24:09.197 --> 24:12.993
Kendall. So, I-- I think
he's very much on the same page

24:13.076 --> 24:16.413
as you, if it doesn't sound
too basic to be, like, good.

24:16.496 --> 24:20.083
Right? Make company nice
and so on? Which-- which I guess

24:20.167 --> 24:23.044
is-- that's kind of your thing,
right?

24:23.128 --> 24:28.967
I found his performance
histrionic and meretricious.

24:29.050 --> 24:31.553
-Well, tell me about it.
-(CLEARS THROAT)

24:32.554 --> 24:35.182

24:36.266 --> 24:37.767
(STUTTERS) No-- Sure.

24:37.851 --> 24:41.396
I just don't like seeing
dirty laundry washed in public.

24:41.479 --> 24:42.689
-GREG: Right?
-Mm-hmm.

24:42.772 --> 24:45.192
Y-- yeah, and that's--
and that's actually why--

24:45.275 --> 24:46.693
why I wanted to chat with you.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.862
I just wanna chart
the right course

24:48.945 --> 24:51.198
through this whole thing,
and Logan's offering me a lawyer

24:51.281 --> 24:54.326
and Kendall's offering me
a lawyer. And I just...

24:54.409 --> 24:56.244
You know, I'm try--
I think I could use

24:56.328 --> 24:59.664
-some independent legal advice.
-Why do you need a lawyer, Greg?

24:59.748 --> 25:02.959
GREG: I mean,
I haven't done anything wrong.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.294
I-- I-- I just think

25:04.377 --> 25:06.546
if everyone's showing up
to battle in armor,

25:06.630 --> 25:09.841
then I feel kinda exposed here
in my loincloth.

25:11.635 --> 25:12.636
Bad visual.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.266
Yes.

25:19.434 --> 25:21.895
-GREG: Yes?
-Yes, I can back you, Greg.

25:22.896 --> 25:24.481
I'll set you up
with a legal counsellor.

25:24.564 --> 25:28.151
Thank you! Thank you, Gramps.
So-- Yeah, sorry, sorry.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.569
-That'll do. Thank you.
-(GRUNTS)

25:29.653 --> 25:31.321
-I'll call you.
-All right!

25:31.404 --> 25:32.697
-You're the man!
-See you.

25:33.782 --> 25:34.824
I love you!

25:35.825 --> 25:37.827
Okay.
Don't touch any of her shit.

25:41.206 --> 25:44.125
KENDALL: Okay, so.
Uh, It's pretty simple.

25:44.209 --> 25:45.961
Let's gang up on Dad
and take him down.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.421
Jesus, let me shut
the door first.

25:48.505 --> 25:51.591
Okay, well, why didn't you come
to us before?

25:51.675 --> 25:53.969
Yeah?
This is a real fucking mess now.

25:54.052 --> 25:58.098
It came together for me
in my head late. And, uh...

25:58.181 --> 26:00.517
you know, it wasn't-- I mean,
I knew what I was gonna do.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.978
-But--
-That was spontaneous?

26:03.061 --> 26:05.438
-Well, I spoke with a lawyer--
-SHIV: Uh-huh.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.649
Oh. Okay.
You spoke with a lawyer?

26:07.732 --> 26:10.652
Yeah. But--
but they advised against.

26:10.735 --> 26:11.987
Essentially, I mean, I--

26:12.070 --> 26:14.030
I don't wanna rehash it all
but...

26:14.114 --> 26:15.782
Look,
I was effectively acting alone.

26:15.865 --> 26:18.451
Right. A spontaneous,
heartfelt out-pouring

26:18.535 --> 26:20.287
of thoroughly lawyered emotion.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.539
You guys can think
whatever you want

26:22.622 --> 26:23.957
in the end of me.

26:26.584 --> 26:31.923
(SCOFFING) Okay, well,
you've made this very hard.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.343
But I'm here to find out
what you want

26:35.427 --> 26:37.679
and to get you to back down.

26:37.762 --> 26:40.390
-ROMAN: Yeah, on Dad's behalf.
-Uh-huh.

26:41.224 --> 26:42.350
KENDALL: Oh, right.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.269
Right, right.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.648
So, if I say I'm taking him down

26:48.732 --> 26:50.775
and I'm not interested
in any deals with him,

26:50.859 --> 26:52.944
you just-- you call
and tell him and just

26:53.028 --> 26:54.321
-take a hike?
-Yep--

26:55.405 --> 26:56.990
-He's here.
-Who's here?

26:57.073 --> 26:58.825
Connor. Send him in.

26:58.908 --> 27:00.785
Right. Thought I heard
a clown car pulling up.

27:00.869 --> 27:02.537
Ideally, I'd like to make
a media appearance,

27:02.620 --> 27:03.830
all four of us.

27:03.913 --> 27:05.665
-Oh. Would you?
-ROMAN: Oh, sweet!

27:05.749 --> 27:08.501
Are we gonna be wearing costumes
that you have designed, asshole?

27:08.585 --> 27:10.754
SHIV: Yeah. That's just
not gonna happen.

27:10.837 --> 27:11.880
(DOOR OPENING)

27:13.965 --> 27:15.342
-(DOOR CLOSING)
-ROMAN: Hey.

27:15.425 --> 27:16.801
-Okay. Well.
-KENDALL: Hey.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.219
-Thanks for coming.
-SHIV: Hey, Con.

27:18.303 --> 27:19.471
Here we all are.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.849
You know,
Pop's looking for you two.

27:22.932 --> 27:25.518
Yeah,
we're he-- here on his behalf.

27:25.602 --> 27:28.271
Oh, sure thing, honey. Me too.
All about Dad.

27:28.355 --> 27:30.190
That's why we're all here.

27:30.273 --> 27:33.151
Okay. Can-- can we, uh,
turn off the devices

27:33.234 --> 27:36.237
and get into this?

27:37.280 --> 27:38.406
(SIGHS)

27:40.825 --> 27:45.872
So, my thing is, if this shit
was just epiphenomenal,

27:45.955 --> 27:47.749
maybe it could be ridden out.

27:48.666 --> 27:50.794
But these incidents
are symptomatic

27:50.877 --> 27:52.045
of a foundational sickness

27:52.128 --> 27:53.505
within our father
and his company.

27:53.588 --> 27:56.299
Hmm, don't he use that tongue
prettier than a 20-dollar whore?

27:56.383 --> 27:59.135
SHIV: (CHUCKLING) Yeah, like,
what's your point?

27:59.219 --> 28:01.388
My point is
the milk is going sour.

28:01.471 --> 28:02.430
CONNOR: Well, that explains it.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.224
KENDALL: You know,
the-- the great whites

28:04.307 --> 28:07.685
from politics to culture,
they're rolling off stage.

28:07.769 --> 28:11.564
-It's our time.
-ROMAN: Oh, you mean us? This...

multi-fucking-ethnic
transgender alliance

28:14.901 --> 28:16.694
of 20-something dreamers
we got right here?

28:16.778 --> 28:19.989
-(SHIV LAUGHS)
-Okay, big picture...

28:20.073 --> 28:22.951
we're the end
of a long American century.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.203
Our company
is a declining empire

28:25.286 --> 28:27.664
-inside a declining empire.
-Amen, brother.

28:27.747 --> 28:30.667
People are--
are killing themselves with guns

28:30.750 --> 28:33.294
or dope so fast
that we're losing pace.

28:33.378 --> 28:34.629
Unsubscribe.

28:34.712 --> 28:36.589
KENDALL: We're--
we're fat-fingered fucks

28:36.673 --> 28:38.633
and we can only live on cream.

28:38.716 --> 28:40.969
US supremacy is waning.

28:41.052 --> 28:43.805
What I think is,
within that context,

28:43.888 --> 28:47.142
we can become omni-national
and reposition.

28:47.225 --> 28:50.186
Because actually, we're not tied
culturally or physically. So--

28:50.270 --> 28:51.688
so we are actually
in a great position

28:51.771 --> 28:53.773
to leapfrog tech.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.818
Information is going to be
more precious than water

28:56.901 --> 28:58.778
in the next 100.

28:58.862 --> 29:00.530
Combine all our news operations,

29:00.613 --> 29:04.284
become the global
news information hub.

29:04.367 --> 29:07.620
Amazon is 20 years old,
Gates is an old geezer.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.790
Detoxify our brand,
and we can go supersonic.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.672
So, what do you say?
Are we interested?

29:18.465 --> 29:19.632
ROMAN: Hmm...

29:19.716 --> 29:22.093
Yeah, there's just something
about betraying our father

29:22.177 --> 29:24.679
that just doesn't sit well
with me.

29:24.762 --> 29:28.558
(SIGHS) He's a central player
in a rotten cabal

29:28.641 --> 29:30.268
that has basically eaten
the heart...

29:30.351 --> 29:32.061
-Okay, well...
-...out of American democracy.

29:32.145 --> 29:34.272
ROMAN: "Rotten Cabal"
is a good name for a band.

29:34.355 --> 29:36.608
He's not gonna be on trial
for that, though, Ken.

29:36.691 --> 29:37.984
Well, maybe he should be.

29:38.067 --> 29:39.819
Yeah, but if he didn't do it,
it would have been someone else

29:39.903 --> 29:41.779
making the same dollar
off the same shit.

29:41.863 --> 29:43.198
-Maybe. Yeah, maybe.
-Yeah.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.658
-SHIV: Yeah.
-Maybe we're all irrelevant.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.452
You know, maybe there was
always gonna be death camps,

29:47.535 --> 29:48.995
and maybe the planet
is going to fry,

29:49.078 --> 29:50.622
and there's nothing we can do.

29:50.705 --> 29:53.750
Or maybe people make
a difference.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.503
I don't know. Do you--
do you think

29:56.586 --> 29:57.795
human beings matter?

29:58.963 --> 30:01.216
You know, I'm just gonna say
right out that I'm a spy

30:01.299 --> 30:02.759
and I'm gonna go back
and tell him everything.

30:02.842 --> 30:04.469
I'm with Dad, so, yeah.

30:04.552 --> 30:05.803
-Fuck you.
-Fine. Fine.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.764
I-- I don't actually
give a fuck. You know, I'm--

30:07.847 --> 30:09.057
I can perfectly
well do this alone.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.226
I'm actually just trying
to be open-hearted

30:11.309 --> 30:14.062
and-- and invite you in here.

30:14.145 --> 30:16.606
I mean, it would probably be
simpler to go alone

30:16.689 --> 30:18.608
but I want to offer you
a fucking ticket

30:18.691 --> 30:21.778
-to the escape pod.
-Nice fucking guy, huh?

30:24.739 --> 30:28.493
KENDALL: You're happy he went
over your head and put in Gerri?

30:28.576 --> 30:30.537
I think that Gerri
is a good choice, yeah.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.914
-SHIV: (CHUCKLING) Oh.
-What?

30:32.997 --> 30:34.207
Whatever. Defend Dad
all you want,

30:34.290 --> 30:35.542
but Gerri can
look after herself.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.418
Yeah, I know that,
I'm not defending Gerri, I'm--

30:37.502 --> 30:40.338

under the covers with Mommy.

30:40.421 --> 30:42.507
-Oh, fuck off, Siobhan.
-Oh, you love showing

30:42.590 --> 30:44.092
your pee-pee to everyone,
but someday, you know,

30:44.175 --> 30:45.802
you're actually gonna have
to fuck something.

Okay, fine. I'll...

30:58.565 --> 31:00.400
-That was low.
-That was an overreaction.

31:00.483 --> 31:02.235
-That was not.
-Can we just try

to keep this nice? Yeah?

stay in control?

42:17.826 --> 42:19.787

show him to his office,

what I think about Dad.

42:36.011 --> 42:38.222
Uh... I love him, I hate him,

42:38.305 --> 42:40.641
I'm gonna outsource it
to my therapist,

42:40.724 --> 42:42.810
but he was gonna send
me to jail...

42:43.644 --> 42:44.687
you know?

42:45.729 --> 42:47.606
He'd do the same to you, Rome...

42:49.692 --> 42:50.693

we're looking at, uh,

-KENDALL: Separate divisions.

43:24.101 --> 43:26.186

43:26.270 --> 43:28.022
as we shift
to these spheres of influence,

43:28.105 --> 43:29.857

what his core is.

-We move forward.
-So, you'll oversee us?

43:31.900 --> 43:34.320
