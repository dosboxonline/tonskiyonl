SQUID GAME 2

01:02.020 --> 01:07.150
EPISODE 4
SIX LEGS

01:26.628 --> 01:27.629
[Jung-bae] Oh!

01:28.880 --> 01:30.882
Just like my mom used to make.

01:32.258 --> 01:33.885
What's in yours?

01:36.679 --> 01:37.972
Aren't you going to eat?

01:40.433 --> 01:41.768
Look, you've got to eat.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.895
You know what they say.
"Eat up, even on your deathbed."

01:44.896 --> 01:48.358
Just do your thinking while you eat,
or afterwards. Here.

01:50.276 --> 01:51.152
Come on.

01:52.320 --> 01:53.404
Forget it then.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.408
This might be for the best.

02:00.119 --> 02:01.578
I don't know about you,

02:01.579 --> 02:04.332
but that 20 million
wouldn't even cover my interest.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.792
If we play just one more game--

02:06.793 --> 02:07.794
Jung-bae.

02:09.379 --> 02:14.342
Last time I was here,
someone said the exact same thing.

02:16.761 --> 02:17.762
And in the end,

02:19.264 --> 02:20.765
that person died here.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.019
[In-ho] Help us then, sir.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.857
You said you've played these games.

02:32.110 --> 02:34.153
I pressed the O button because of you.

02:35.989 --> 02:39.826
Honestly, I was scared.
I wanted to quit and leave.

02:40.618 --> 02:45.247
But you made me think
maybe I could play just one more game.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.874
- [man 1] Me too.
- [man 2] Same here.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.501
- [man 3] Yes.
- [man 4] Me too.

02:50.503 --> 02:51.546
[sighs softly]

02:52.839 --> 02:53.840
[In-ho] Sir.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.885
You know which game's next, don't you?

03:01.389 --> 03:02.432
That's right.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.102
You're a previous winner,
so you should know.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.271
What are we playing next?

03:11.190 --> 03:12.442
The second game

03:13.860 --> 03:15.445
was <i>Dalgona.</i>

03:17.947 --> 03:21.534
<i>Dalgona?</i> The sugar candy
with a shape you can carve out?

03:22.201 --> 03:23.077
That's right.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.622
We had to choose one of four shapes
and carve it out.

03:26.623 --> 03:30.792
Four shapes? Which was the easiest one?

03:30.793 --> 03:31.961
Triangle.

03:33.046 --> 03:34.714
Which was the hardest one?

03:35.673 --> 03:36.715
Umbrella.

03:36.716 --> 03:37.634
Umbrella?

03:38.217 --> 03:39.385
[scoffs]

03:39.969 --> 03:41.762
Some people chose umbrella?

03:41.763 --> 03:43.139
[intriguing music]

03:44.474 --> 03:49.062
Those unlucky bastards
must have bitten the dust.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.987
So that means
we should all just pick triangle.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.531
Everyone could probably pass the round.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.159
[Jeong-dae] Hush now!

04:04.118 --> 04:08.538
If all 365 of us survive,
the prize money won't go up at all.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.249
Then we'll have risked
our lives again for nothing.

04:11.250 --> 04:13.293
- [man 5] That's true.
- [woman 1] He's right.

04:13.294 --> 04:18.173
[whispering] Listen. We should probably
keep this information to ourselves.

04:18.174 --> 04:20.300
- What do you say?
- [woman 2] Let's do that.

04:20.301 --> 04:21.969
[Gi-hun] We can't do that.

04:21.970 --> 04:24.847
I'm telling you this
to save everyone's lives.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.266
If it's confirmed
that the next game is <i>Dalgona,</i>

04:28.267 --> 04:30.728
I'm going to tell everyone what I know.

04:33.856 --> 04:34.899
[Jeong-dae scoffs]

04:36.067 --> 04:38.110
[Yeong-sam] <i>Dalgona,</i> triangle.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.989
[players grumbling]

04:45.410 --> 04:46.995
So which shape did you pick?

04:47.620 --> 04:49.163
[intriguing music]

04:52.542 --> 04:55.211
[Yong-sik] Mom, I just found out
something important.

05:00.383 --> 05:02.552
Shit. Mom!

05:08.266 --> 05:10.101
[Player 149] You can have it.

05:12.186 --> 05:14.647
[whispering] You should eat it
for your baby.

05:15.481 --> 05:17.483
Eggs are good for pregnant women.

05:21.738 --> 05:28.285
I've helped more than a dozen women
in my neighborhood deliver their babies.

05:28.286 --> 05:34.042
I can tell just by looking
at your body shape and the way you walk.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.795
It looks like
your due date is getting closer.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.131
If you compress your belly to hide it,

05:41.132 --> 05:44.384
it'll be bad for both you and your baby.
It could be dangerous.

05:44.385 --> 05:46.720
That's why you were in pain earlier.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.347
It's not what you think.

05:49.223 --> 05:50.098
[sighs]

05:50.099 --> 05:54.186
How did you end up in a place like this
in your condition?

05:54.187 --> 05:55.103
[footsteps approach]

05:55.104 --> 05:57.147
- [Yong-sik] What are you doing?
- You startled me!

05:57.148 --> 05:59.024
- Come. No time for socializing.
- What...

05:59.025 --> 06:01.276
All right, just wait.

06:01.277 --> 06:03.236
You should finish your food,

06:03.237 --> 06:05.655
and if something feels off,
come find me right away.

06:05.656 --> 06:08.784
- [Yong-sik] Come on!
- I'll be over there, okay?

06:08.785 --> 06:10.953
[Player 149] Why? What is it?

06:14.415 --> 06:15.249
[sighs]

06:22.340 --> 06:23.966
[In-ho] May I ask you something?

06:30.890 --> 06:33.643
Why did you come back to this place?

06:35.144 --> 06:37.395
You said you won and made it out.

06:37.396 --> 06:40.149
Then you must have received 45.6 billion.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.693
Did you spend it all?

06:43.861 --> 06:45.403
Did you bet on horses again?

06:45.404 --> 06:47.406
That money doesn't belong to me.

06:50.284 --> 06:53.121
It's blood money
for the people who died here.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.208
The same goes for the money up there.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.754
You don't have to think of it that way.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.006
It's not like you killed those people,

07:05.007 --> 07:07.927
and saving that money
won't bring them back to life.

07:08.719 --> 07:13.599
If you had pressed the X,
everyone here would've made it out alive.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.521
That's right.
I was the last to press the O button.

07:20.189 --> 07:24.860
But there were 182 more people
who wanted to stay.

07:24.861 --> 07:28.823
And there were also 182 people
who wanted to leave.

07:29.574 --> 07:30.950
Let's say

07:32.577 --> 07:37.206
I pressed X and we all left.
Would everyone have been happy?

07:37.790 --> 07:40.041
Do you think if they ran into me later,

07:40.042 --> 07:45.423
they'd thank me for saving their lives
and tell me they're happy now?

07:49.635 --> 07:53.638
[Jung-bae] All right.
There's no point in placing blame now.

07:53.639 --> 07:56.683
You know the saying,
a widow understands a widower best.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.477
Let's just focus on tomorrow's game, okay?

07:59.478 --> 08:01.563
He has won all these games before.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.900
If we stick together,
we'll have nothing to worry about.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.152
[man] He's right, sirs.

08:09.780 --> 08:10.697
[exhales]

08:10.698 --> 08:12.074
We have to stick together.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.701
I'll be with you all the way.

08:14.702 --> 08:15.827
Who are you?

08:15.828 --> 08:17.330
My good sir.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.125
I'm Dae-ho. Kang Dae-ho.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.127
- Oh, Mr. Dae-ho.
- Yes.

08:24.128 --> 08:25.046
Have we met?

08:26.255 --> 08:27.298
[chuckles awkwardly]

08:27.882 --> 08:30.842
Earlier during the game,
Mr. 456 here was like,

08:30.843 --> 08:34.846
"Freeze!" And I became his fan.

08:34.847 --> 08:37.808
I'd like to get to know you, sirs.
Please give me the chance!

08:38.851 --> 08:41.019
"Freeze!" That was so cool.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.354
[Jung-bae] Hang on.

08:42.355 --> 08:43.563
[Dae-ho] Yes, sir?

08:43.564 --> 08:44.814
You were in the Marines?

08:44.815 --> 08:46.107
- Yes, why?
- [march music]

08:46.108 --> 08:47.193
Class number?

08:48.694 --> 08:49.779
[chuckles]

08:50.446 --> 08:51.447
[Jung-bae snorts]

08:52.240 --> 08:53.074
You're laughing?

08:56.953 --> 08:59.162
[Dae-ho] Victory at all costs!

08:59.163 --> 09:00.998
I was in Class 1140, sir!

09:01.582 --> 09:02.416
At ease!

09:03.042 --> 09:03.960
"Dae-ho."

09:04.752 --> 09:06.962
I knew there was something about you.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.673
- Sir!
- Class 746 here. Let's make a good team.

09:09.674 --> 09:10.715
I won't let you down!

09:10.716 --> 09:11.675
[laughs heartily]

09:11.676 --> 09:13.468
Sir!

09:13.469 --> 09:16.054
[Jung-bae] You're full of spirit.
[chuckles]

09:16.055 --> 09:17.014
[Dae-ho] Yes, sir!

09:18.391 --> 09:19.225
Yes!

09:22.270 --> 09:23.854
[Nam-gyu] Enjoying your food?

09:24.563 --> 09:26.273
I couldn't eat.

09:26.274 --> 09:30.027
After seeing everyone get shot dead,
you still have a damn appetite?

09:30.569 --> 09:33.322
That crypto ruined my life too.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.826
- That's why I'm here, to make money.
- [footsteps approaching]

09:37.785 --> 09:40.287
That's right.
You'd better make a lot of money.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.497
Because of that damn coin,

09:42.498 --> 09:47.836
I lost over 500 million won, the money
I earned from busting my ass rapping.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.170
[Nam-gyu] I lost 300 million.

09:49.171 --> 09:53.801
You'd better win the games
and make a load of money to pay us back.

09:54.385 --> 09:56.846
I get it. Can you go away now?
I'm trying to eat--

09:57.430 --> 10:00.725
You little shit,
eating like a fucking pig.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.309
Give it back.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.227
No.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.689
[Thanos] You want to eat this so badly?

10:07.398 --> 10:09.482
Then Thanos will feed you.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.527
[Myung-gi yelps]

10:13.696 --> 10:15.239
- Good, isn't it?
- [tense music]

10:15.823 --> 10:17.407
[Thanos and Nam-gyu laugh]

10:17.408 --> 10:19.576
- [Myung-gi] Motherfucker.
- [Nam-gyu] Son of a bitch.

10:19.577 --> 10:21.745
- [Myung-gi] You asshole.
- [Thanos] Knock it off.

10:21.746 --> 10:22.871
[Nam-gyu] Fucking asshole.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.291
[players murmur, exclaim]

10:26.042 --> 10:27.083
[Thanos] Son of a bitch.

10:27.084 --> 10:29.920
I lost all that money
because of you, fucker.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.214
- [Thanos] You piece of shit.
- [Nam-gyu] Let me get in there.

10:33.215 --> 10:35.091
- You son of a bitch.
- [Thanos] Hey.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.260
Step aside.

10:37.094 --> 10:40.513
Be grateful and fucking eat
what you're given!

10:40.514 --> 10:44.017
It's good to be young.
They still have the energy to do that.

10:44.018 --> 10:47.562
He might get really hurt.
Someone should stop them.

10:47.563 --> 10:48.647
I know.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.440
[players exclaim]

10:50.441 --> 10:52.193
- Me?
- [Thanos grunts]

10:54.528 --> 10:56.029
[players gasp]

10:56.030 --> 10:58.699
Boys, what are you doing
in the middle of mealtime?

10:59.408 --> 11:01.034
No fights during mealtime.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.578
There are elders present.
Mind your manners.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.456
And two against one?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.375
Aren't you embarrassed?

11:08.376 --> 11:11.796
You're lecturing me
when you ended up in this shithole too?

11:12.463 --> 11:15.925
Dude, stop running your mouth

11:16.675 --> 11:18.427
and take care of your own damn kids.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.889
What did you just say?

11:22.932 --> 11:25.726
I said save the lecture
for your own damn kids.

11:26.685 --> 11:27.727
[Nam-gyu] Son of a bitch.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.730
- [ominous music]
- [Nam-gyu groans]

11:30.314 --> 11:31.232
[Thanos grunts]

11:33.484 --> 11:34.527
[Thanos groans]

11:36.278 --> 11:37.195
[Thanos gasping] Wait.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.657
- [bones cracking]
- [Thanos groans]

11:45.287 --> 11:46.288
I'm sorry.

11:47.498 --> 11:49.750
Please...

11:53.921 --> 11:54.922
Let me go.

11:58.509 --> 11:59.343
[Thanos coughs]

12:01.262 --> 12:05.558
- [woman 1] Great! You're the man!
- [man] Nice!

12:08.144 --> 12:09.603
[woman 2] That was cool!

12:16.735 --> 12:17.820
What is he?

12:19.071 --> 12:20.239
Is he an ex-Marine too?

12:26.078 --> 12:28.080
[mysterious music]

12:28.914 --> 12:32.041
[woman on PA]
<i>The day's work has been completed.</i>

12:32.042 --> 12:36.130
<i>All soldiers,
please return to your quarters.</i>

12:50.603 --> 12:52.605
[chilling music]

12:53.564 --> 12:54.647
Na-yeon!

12:54.648 --> 12:56.650
[siren wailing]

12:57.651 --> 12:58.818
[paramedic] Are you with her?

12:58.819 --> 13:00.278
<i>Yes, I'm her father.</i>

13:00.279 --> 13:02.490
<i>Please take her
to Seohyeon University Hospital.</i>

13:19.006 --> 13:23.928
Dissolve my karmic ties and grievances...

13:47.660 --> 13:50.204
[Yong-sik whispering] Mom, are you asleep?

13:56.001 --> 13:57.002
[Yong-sik sighs]

14:04.051 --> 14:05.594
Honey, I'm sorry.

14:08.222 --> 14:11.392
I'm sorry.

14:14.645 --> 14:15.771
[In-ho] Excuse me.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.234
If you're still up,
can we have a little talk?

14:22.152 --> 14:23.112
Sure.

14:30.411 --> 14:34.414
I think I was out of line before.
I'd like to apologize. I'm sorry.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.834
No, that's okay.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.547
I laid all the blame on you.

14:43.757 --> 14:45.092
I was out of line.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.436
My wife is very sick.

14:58.439 --> 15:01.442
She has acute cirrhosis.
She needs a liver transplant.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.613
But when she was going through the tests,

15:06.947 --> 15:08.699
we found out she was pregnant.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.075
[somber music]

15:11.076 --> 15:13.203
The doctor suggested a termination,

15:14.330 --> 15:15.956
but she won't listen.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.043
Says she'll give birth
even if it kills her.

15:20.127 --> 15:23.172
You see, my wife is stubborn.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.759
I've never been able
to change her mind about anything.

15:29.887 --> 15:33.974
We were struggling to find a donor,
and her condition was getting worse.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.728
I borrowed as much money as I could,

15:38.979 --> 15:40.397
but it still wasn't enough.

15:42.483 --> 15:46.278
I was desperate.
Then one of my oldest vendors

15:47.488 --> 15:49.865
heard about my situation
and offered to help.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.368
So I borrowed money from them.

15:55.871 --> 15:57.665
But people saw it as a bribe,

15:58.707 --> 16:01.168
and I got fired from my job.

16:03.587 --> 16:06.131
I had devoted my entire youth to it.

16:09.176 --> 16:13.138
These games were my last hope.

16:17.726 --> 16:18.727
I get it.

16:20.104 --> 16:23.399
I know what
you were trying to say, Mr. 456.

16:26.068 --> 16:27.528
What that money represents.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.491
But I...

16:37.287 --> 16:38.913
I really need that money,

16:38.914 --> 16:40.958
even if it's blood money.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.127
I need that money...

16:54.346 --> 16:59.852
to save my wife and our child.

17:11.238 --> 17:13.240
[eerie music]

17:20.914 --> 17:21.874
Close up.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.626
Why? Nothing usable?

17:35.012 --> 17:36.263
[masked soldier] What the hell?

17:38.056 --> 17:39.932
This is it? Where's the rest?

17:39.933 --> 17:42.018
The organs were not viable.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.354
Dead too long.
Only the eyes were salvageable.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.857
I told you to bring live ones.

17:47.858 --> 17:50.694
[masked soldier] What are you
talking about? I missed on purpose.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.281
[doctor] Someone shot them again
to make sure they died.

17:58.285 --> 17:59.703
That guy too.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.500
He was shot in the leg,
but someone shot him again in the head.

18:05.834 --> 18:06.752
[masked soldier sighs]

18:07.961 --> 18:10.088
Who's doing this?

18:25.813 --> 18:27.481
[scanner trilling]

18:28.065 --> 18:29.566
[automated voice] <i>Identity confirmed.</i>

18:30.484 --> 18:31.526
[radio beeps]

18:31.527 --> 18:34.279
[man on radio] <i>Sir. Reporting
from the operating room.</i>

18:35.239 --> 18:36.615
[Masked Officer] How did it go?

18:38.992 --> 18:42.703
[man on radio] <i>Most players were shot
in the head or chest and died on the spot.</i>

18:42.704 --> 18:45.748
<i>Someone shot those who were still alive
a second time to confirm the kill.</i>

18:45.749 --> 18:47.751
<i>We only got a few usable products.</i>

18:51.547 --> 18:52.589
Who did that?

18:54.925 --> 18:56.426
Number 011, I think.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.555
[radio beeps]

19:02.683 --> 19:06.270
- [lid pops]
- [liquid pouring]

19:17.281 --> 19:18.949
[door opens]

19:25.163 --> 19:26.290
[masked manager] Number 011.

19:29.668 --> 19:30.878
Officer wants to see you.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.801
[enigmatic music]

20:10.959 --> 20:12.168
[scanner trilling]

20:12.169 --> 20:13.753
[automated voice] <i>Identity confirmed.</i>

20:13.754 --> 20:16.381
[tense music]

20:41.114 --> 20:42.115
[remote beeps]

20:51.166 --> 20:52.584
[No-eul] You wanted to see me, sir?

20:53.669 --> 20:55.212
Mask off.

21:03.887 --> 21:06.640
I told you not to interfere
if you're not going to help.

21:12.062 --> 21:15.732
I hear you shot them a second time
to make sure they died.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.944
I was just doing my job.

21:22.155 --> 21:23.991
How long...

21:25.867 --> 21:27.369
have we known each other?

21:27.953 --> 21:29.704
I don't quite remember.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.456
[Masked Officer] If I remember correctly...

21:37.713 --> 21:39.756
it's been about seven years.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.466
[puffs]

21:43.635 --> 21:45.721
When I first went to see you,

21:47.347 --> 21:51.435
you were staring at the ceiling
like a corpse in that cheap hospital room.

21:52.769 --> 21:55.522
I couldn't believe you had taken out
the entire pursuit unit

21:56.356 --> 22:00.235
and made your way
to the demarcation line by yourself.

22:06.783 --> 22:08.660
I felt bad for you.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.417
I wanted to give you a second chance.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.295
I've always been grateful to you.

22:19.046 --> 22:20.671
Then do what I tell you.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.549
I do not wish to.

22:25.343 --> 22:27.304
Are you afraid the captain might find out?

22:29.723 --> 22:31.475
You don't have to worry about that.

22:32.059 --> 22:35.102
We made a mistake last time
and had a player do the operations

22:35.103 --> 22:36.604
in exchange for game info.

22:36.605 --> 22:39.732
This time, we hired a doctor from outside.

22:39.733 --> 22:42.359
So he will never find out,
and even if he does--

22:42.360 --> 22:43.360
It's not about that.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.946
[yelling] Then what is it about?

22:46.573 --> 22:47.699
[Masked Officer sighs]

23:00.962 --> 23:01.922
[exhales]

23:04.299 --> 23:09.470
When we first met, you said you wanted
to find the child you left behind.

23:09.471 --> 23:10.805
[chilling music]

23:10.806 --> 23:13.308
You said you'd do anything.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.147
Did you have a change of heart?

23:22.526 --> 23:25.112
When you first came to me,

23:26.071 --> 23:27.531
you said my job here would be

23:28.990 --> 23:33.495
helping those who feel hopeless
by putting them out of their misery.

23:35.747 --> 23:39.459
I trusted you.
That's what I came here to do.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.672
You're the one who has changed.

23:46.299 --> 23:48.218
Those people are going to die anyway.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.472
We're just using their organs
to save others.

23:53.181 --> 23:54.808
What's wrong with that?

23:55.559 --> 23:59.354
If there are no further orders,
I'd like to be excused.

24:15.745 --> 24:19.124
SEOUL DOBONG POLICE STATION

24:28.675 --> 24:30.635
[detective] Hey, Hwang. It's been a while.

24:34.598 --> 24:35.764
[table thunks]

24:35.765 --> 24:37.100
[chief yelling] Hwang Jun-ho!

24:37.893 --> 24:40.311
You handed in your resignation
without a word to me?

24:40.312 --> 24:42.855
Then you went MIA.
Where the hell have you been?

24:42.856 --> 24:46.443
Do you know how much I had to beg
to change it to a leave of absence?

24:47.027 --> 24:48.944
Chief, are you finished?

24:48.945 --> 24:49.945
What?

24:49.946 --> 24:51.155
Please help me.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.073
[scoffs]

24:52.574 --> 24:55.367
Look, what else
could I possibly do for you?

24:55.368 --> 24:57.454
You want me to look
for that island with you?

24:58.038 --> 24:58.872
Yes.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.081
[sighs] For God's sake.

25:01.082 --> 25:03.334
We must start the search immediately.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.922
Otherwise, Mr. Seong Gi-hun
and everyone else there will be in danger.

25:07.881 --> 25:10.758
Haven't we already
finished discussing this?

25:10.759 --> 25:13.719
Sir, things have changed since then.

25:13.720 --> 25:17.765
If we don't stop them now,
we may not get another chance.

25:17.766 --> 25:19.642
- [chief of police] Chief Kim.
- Yes, sir.

25:19.643 --> 25:22.896
What's gotten into him this time?
You said he was doing better.

25:24.314 --> 25:27.358
Jun-ho, go back to therapy.
It's nothing to be embarrassed about.

25:27.359 --> 25:28.485
[yelling] Sir!

25:29.069 --> 25:31.278
Are you really going to let
those people die?

25:31.279 --> 25:34.574
[yelling] You've been talking
about this shit for years now!

25:35.158 --> 25:36.826
If it's true, bring me evidence!

25:37.410 --> 25:40.622
The police work with evidence!

25:46.503 --> 25:47.962
Process his resignation.

25:47.963 --> 25:49.588
He's beyond help now.

25:49.589 --> 25:51.132
But, sir...

25:52.926 --> 25:55.220
Damn it. Hey!

25:55.804 --> 25:59.390
I told you this was a bad idea.
You'll never be able to come back now.

25:59.391 --> 26:04.144
Sir! I'll make sure
he goes back to therapy! Please wait!

26:04.145 --> 26:07.565
[Woo-seok] See? What did I tell you?
Police are never helpful.

26:08.441 --> 26:12.112
We'll do it ourselves. If we split into
two teams, we might have a chance.

26:12.696 --> 26:16.323
Yeah. Captain Park
got another boat for us,

26:16.324 --> 26:19.994
and we also got more men.
We divided them into two search teams.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.162
Okay, good.

26:21.788 --> 26:24.581
If the games have begun,
we only have five days at most.

26:24.582 --> 26:25.833
We've got to move fast.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.084
Got it.

26:27.085 --> 26:30.045
We're all set to go
once the weather clears up.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.506
I'll see you soon.

26:42.017 --> 26:44.769
Have a drink and relax.
We can't set sail today anyway.

26:45.645 --> 26:46.688
[sighs]

26:50.442 --> 26:53.652
[Woo-seok] Captain, are you sure
we can go tomorrow?

26:53.653 --> 26:56.572
Tomorrow's weather forecast
isn't looking good either.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.116
Look.

26:59.075 --> 27:00.827
I've been sailing for 30 years.

27:01.578 --> 27:05.497
You think those guys who sit
in front of their computers all day

27:05.498 --> 27:07.082
know the seas better than me?

27:07.083 --> 27:10.795
I'll blame you
if we can't set sail tomorrow, then.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.839
What's the rush?

27:13.840 --> 27:16.216
We've been trying to find that island
for two years.

27:16.217 --> 27:17.551
How will you find it now?

27:17.552 --> 27:22.724
Well, this is a secret,
so I can't really tell you in detail.

27:24.017 --> 27:27.437
But one of our friends
has been taken to that island.

27:30.106 --> 27:31.483
The one who was there before?

27:32.067 --> 27:32.942
What?

27:33.735 --> 27:38.156
Wait, you know about Mr. Seong?

27:39.491 --> 27:41.367
Hwang gave me a rough idea.

27:41.368 --> 27:45.330
All right, then. I can just tell you.

27:46.956 --> 27:51.043
His name is Seong Gi-hun.
He's a previous winner of the game.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.337
He wanted to get back at those bastards,

27:53.338 --> 27:57.049
so he put a GPS tracker in here
and let them take him to the island.

27:57.050 --> 27:59.885
But I don't know how the intel leaked.

27:59.886 --> 28:03.430
So everything Hwang told me was true?

28:03.431 --> 28:04.723
Yeah!

28:04.724 --> 28:08.435
I just helped him look for the island

28:08.436 --> 28:10.605
because I rescued the guy from the water.

28:11.940 --> 28:14.900
But, come on,
I couldn't believe what he was saying.

28:14.901 --> 28:16.485
About the games, the money, and--

28:16.486 --> 28:20.323
Captain, I didn't believe it
at first either.

28:21.116 --> 28:26.537
But they really do exist.
Those masked men. I saw them.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.499
They zapped me with a stun gun at a club.

28:30.917 --> 28:32.251
Masked men with stun guns?

28:32.252 --> 28:33.169
Yeah!

28:33.753 --> 28:37.674
So that's why you brought all those men.

28:39.217 --> 28:40.593
[Captain] Damn.

28:42.262 --> 28:45.305
They look so intimidating.
Like a bunch of sharks.

28:45.306 --> 28:48.851
[Woo-seok] We're dealing
with some brutal bastards here.

28:48.852 --> 28:51.146
My boss was looking for them, and...

28:52.147 --> 28:53.398
[sighs]

28:54.899 --> 28:58.402
Anyway, you're now
in the same boat as us, okay?

28:58.403 --> 29:00.613
We live or die together.

29:01.197 --> 29:06.035
Nobody is going to die.
I've been sailing that boat for ten years.

29:06.786 --> 29:08.955
Never seen any trouble.

29:09.622 --> 29:10.999
No one's even tripped once.

29:11.666 --> 29:12.542
[chuckles]

29:13.251 --> 29:15.670
- All right. I'll count on you then.
- [glasses clinking]

29:18.173 --> 29:21.217
[woman on PA] <i>Welcome to your second game.</i>

29:24.304 --> 29:26.139
[intriguing music]

29:28.600 --> 29:30.351
So the triangle is the easiest one?

29:31.936 --> 29:32.770
Yes.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.442
[players whispering]

29:46.075 --> 29:49.370
[chilling music]

29:51.247 --> 29:56.461
Hey. How's that a triangle?
Even we Marines couldn't do that!

29:57.795 --> 29:59.213
[Jung-bae exclaims in despair]

29:59.214 --> 30:01.757
This is supposed to be the easiest one?

30:01.758 --> 30:06.303
What the heck is that?
This guy is going to get us all killed!

30:06.304 --> 30:07.429
- Hey!
- I...

30:07.430 --> 30:11.141
What are you going to do,
take responsibility for this?

30:11.142 --> 30:14.269
You said you won! You said you've done it!

30:14.270 --> 30:15.854
- No, I...
- What are you going to do?

30:15.855 --> 30:17.356
How will you take responsibility?

30:17.357 --> 30:22.110
- Do something! [yelling hysterically]
- [Gi-hun breathing nervously]

30:22.111 --> 30:23.654
I... I just...

30:23.655 --> 30:26.031
[panting]

30:26.032 --> 30:28.368
[classical music playing on speakers]

30:49.722 --> 30:50.848
[Jun-hee] Look at you.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.019
Jun-hee.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.355
So you really had no clue?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.567
I thought you were just ignoring me.

31:01.401 --> 31:05.153
Well, you've always been self-absorbed.

31:05.154 --> 31:06.989
Why are you here?

31:06.990 --> 31:08.199
Have you forgotten?

31:09.659 --> 31:12.911
You told me to buy that coin too.

31:12.912 --> 31:14.205
[sighs]

31:21.671 --> 31:22.672
You...

31:23.381 --> 31:25.799
Oh, you haven't forgotten about this.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.970
You didn't get rid of it? We agreed.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.222
I'm keeping it.

31:32.223 --> 31:35.475
How can you raise a baby
without any money?

31:35.476 --> 31:36.977
[Jun-hee] I'm going to make money.

31:36.978 --> 31:40.023
I'm going to make money,
pay off my debt, and get a place for us.

31:42.525 --> 31:45.402
This baby has no father,
so its mom needs to make money.

31:45.403 --> 31:47.322
That's why you're here? To make money?

31:48.072 --> 31:50.949
How the hell will you survive here
in your condition?

31:50.950 --> 31:53.620
I'm not going to ask for your help,
so drop the act.

31:54.829 --> 31:56.289
It doesn't suit you.

31:58.833 --> 32:00.083
That's what you came to say?

32:00.084 --> 32:02.879
No, I came to take a look

It'd be embarrassing for brave Marines
to be carving <i>Dalgona</i> anyway.

36:06.706 --> 36:09.709
If we're playing a game,
it should be worth risking our lives for.

36:10.293 --> 36:13.128
Like Buck Buck or the Squid Game, right?

36:13.129 --> 36:16.716
Yes! I will certainly
risk my life to win, sir.

[Dae-ho] Leave it to me, sir.
I'll go find someone.

Mind your own business.
I can take care of myself.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.973
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

You know that all those people
were out to kill me.

37:12.772 --> 37:16.274
You completely ignored me
for six months. I thought you were dead.

37:47.556 --> 37:49.100
- Because he can run fast?
- Yeah.

37:49.642 --> 37:51.352
I told you. It may not be a race...

37:52.895 --> 37:54.730
If you need one more person, I could...

38:01.320 --> 38:02.697
No, we're good.

Would you like to team up with me?

- If it's about strength, we've got it, so...
- Excuse me.

38:32.643 --> 38:34.854
If you need two people, can we join you?

38:35.563 --> 38:38.106
Sure. That'd be great.

38:38.107 --> 38:39.315
Where's the other person?

38:39.316 --> 38:40.735
Ah... Um...

38:42.987 --> 38:48.075
[scoffs] I'm sorry. You're not
the kind of people we're looking for.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.369
All right.

38:51.370 --> 38:54.540
We'll take you if you ditch the old lady.

38:55.958 --> 38:58.085
The old lady is my mom.

39:03.007 --> 39:07.635
Yong-sik, you should join them.
I'll find a team on my own.

39:07.636 --> 39:11.098
Mom! Don't be ridiculous now.

39:13.809 --> 39:18.063
Mom, why do you look so down?
You're a tough cookie.

39:18.064 --> 39:21.191
Keep your head up.

You little brat.
How dare you take that tone with me?

- You've got some nerve!
- There you go.

- Do you really know how to spin a top?
- [Player 044 mumbling]

49:40.811 --> 49:43.897
If you're not confident,
you can switch places with me...

49:44.690 --> 49:48.526
Only the gods of heaven and earth
decide where I go.

49:48.527 --> 49:50.737
You fools can stay where you are.

49:51.655 --> 49:54.157
Why does this skank
keep talking down to us?

49:55.117 --> 49:57.661
[Player 149] Does she think shamans
are just allowed to be rude?

[man 1] We should have left!
We're all going to die now!

We're all going to die
because of those who voted to continue!

51:13.820 --> 51:15.821
[man 2 sobbing]
What are you going to do now?

51:15.822 --> 51:18.574
- You think you can survive?
- [man 1] Look at them!

51:18.575 --> 51:20.743

- [man 1] You killed them.

51:20.744 --> 51:23.622
Can you...
Can you please give me one of those?

51:24.122 --> 51:25.664
- [Thanos] "Those"?
- The thing you took.

51:25.665 --> 51:28.251
You're keeping them inside your cross.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.339
[in English] I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

51:32.923 --> 51:35.550
If I get nervous and lose the game,
we'll all die.

51:36.635 --> 51:39.053
My hands are shaking like crazy.

51:39.054 --> 51:40.930

- Right. Nam-gyu.
<i>- Please wait while we tidy up the venue.</i>

51:47.395 --> 51:48.395
Do you know what this is?

51:48.396 --> 51:51.107
Ecstasy? Ketamine?

51:51.858 --> 51:56.111
It's a new kind. It's fucking crazy, man.
You can't handle it.

51:56.112 --> 51:57.322
Hey.

52:00.534 --> 52:03.702
I did all kinds of stuff
when I was working at the club.

52:03.703 --> 52:08.583
I even brought you some
when you came to the club.

You junkie.

What?

Nothing.

What's your name again?

52:30.355 --> 52:31.897
It's Min-su.

52:31.898 --> 52:32.816
Min-su.

52:33.692 --> 52:36.903
Min-su, what's that famous quote
by Admiral Yi Sun-sin?

52:38.738 --> 52:42.241
"Those seeking life shall croak.
Those seeking death shall live."

52:42.242 --> 52:47.121
So don't be scared. Just tell yourself
that you don't care if you die.

52:47.122 --> 52:50.333
Then we'll survive, win the money,
and get the fuck out.

52:51.793 --> 52:53.879
[Player 380] Hey, mind your own business.

52:54.462 --> 52:55.546

Yes, you. Mr. Shaky Hands.

52:57.757 --> 52:59.301
What's with the attitude?

53:00.010 --> 53:02.595
We shouldn't have picked a girl.
She's got an attitude.

53:02.596 --> 53:06.056
You're a prick.
You had to pop a pill for your nerves.

53:06.057 --> 53:07.057

54:55.041 --> 54:57.627
Kim Young-mi.

55:00.672 --> 55:05.176
[Hyun-ju] Young-mi, when you spoke
to me earlier, I could tell right away.

55:05.969 --> 55:07.929
I could tell how brave you are.

55:09.097 --> 55:12.017
So you've got to believe in yourself.

55:13.768 --> 55:14.644
Can you do that?

55:17.856 --> 55:19.190
I'll try.

55:20.400 --> 55:25.904
[Player 149] That's right.
I, Jang Geum-ja, survived the Korean War.

55:25.905 --> 55:29.117
I will not die playing some kids' games.

55:30.410 --> 55:33.788
Everyone, let's pull ourselves together
and do this.

55:34.456 --> 55:37.667
I'm the son of Ms. Jang Geum-ja,
who survived the Korean War.

55:38.293 --> 55:39.669

55:48.553 --> 55:49.679
shaman of the sea.

55:55.810 --> 55:58.354
I believe we can do this.

55:59.147 --> 56:01.941
Let's show everyone else here

56:03.401 --> 56:07.113
that these games are no big deal.
