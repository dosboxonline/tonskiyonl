are still humans

05:18.190 --> 05:19.691

05:19.826 --> 05:22.625
Do not underestimate
the judgement of the wizard.

05:22.761 --> 05:24.861
To protect the power
of the gods,

05:24.996 --> 05:27.699
he will have chosen
with meticulous precision

05:27.834 --> 05:31.566

intelligent champions

05:31.702 --> 05:34.071

I don't deserve these powers,
if I'm being honest.

05:38.744 --> 05:40.205
Like, what am I even
contributing?

05:40.341 --> 05:42.346
There's already a superhero
with a red suit,

05:42.481 --> 05:43.479
with a lightning bolt on it

05:43.615 --> 05:45.584
and I'm fast, but he's faster.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.385
Aquaman is literally huge,
and he's so manly

05:49.520 --> 05:50.890
and Batman is so cool!

05:51.025 --> 05:52.787
And I'm just me.

05:52.923 --> 05:54.395
And I can't say this
to anyone else,

05:54.530 --> 05:55.961
'cause my family looks to me
as a leader,

05:56.096 --> 05:57.895
but I feel like

05:58.031 --> 05:59.031
a fraud.

05:59.167 --> 06:00.632
You understand I'm a...

06:01.498 --> 06:02.997
pediatrician,

06:04.972 --> 06:06.473
right?

06:06.608 --> 06:08.539
I mean, yeah, well,
you were recommended

06:08.675 --> 06:10.339
by another patient,
Billy Batson.

06:10.474 --> 06:11.641
It doesn't matter.

06:11.777 --> 06:13.512
Can you help fix my thoughts
so that

06:13.648 --> 06:15.475
they just, like, you know,
stop happening?

06:15.610 --> 06:16.979
All right, look.

06:17.114 --> 06:18.545
And, again, pediatrician,
not a psychiatrist,

06:18.681 --> 06:20.519
but it sounds to me like

06:20.655 --> 06:23.184
you're experiencing
imposter syndrome.

06:23.319 --> 06:26.622
And often, that originates
from trauma early in life,

06:26.757 --> 06:29.021
so if you don't
mind me asking,

06:29.157 --> 06:31.263
how well do you remember
your childhood?

06:31.399 --> 06:32.961
Like it was today. [chuckles]

06:33.730 --> 06:35.564
Trauma? Uh, I don't know.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.031
I mean, I never met my dad.

06:37.167 --> 06:40.573
Uh, my mom abandoned me
at a Christmas carnival.

06:40.709 --> 06:42.206
I spent a lot of time
in the foster system,

06:42.342 --> 06:43.307
ran away from 11 homes,

06:43.443 --> 06:44.575
got into a lot of fights.

06:44.711 --> 06:45.979
Then I was abducted
by a wizard

06:46.115 --> 06:47.373
who gave me superpowers

06:47.508 --> 06:49.148
and then dude just, like,
died in front of my face.

06:49.284 --> 06:50.348
That's not a small amount.

06:50.484 --> 06:51.713
A doctor conjured seven demons

06:51.848 --> 06:53.113
and held my whole family
hostage,

06:53.248 --> 06:54.651
so we had to rip out
one of his eyeballs,

06:54.786 --> 06:56.316
and then everybody
got superpowers,

06:56.452 --> 06:58.186
but now everyone's kind of,
like, doing their own thing

06:58.322 --> 06:59.889
and I'm the only one trying
to keep everybody together.

07:00.024 --> 07:02.889
Okay, okay.
Well, let's just process that.

07:03.025 --> 07:05.526
Right?
Rejected by your parents,

07:05.662 --> 07:07.029
then by the system,

07:07.164 --> 07:09.767
and now rejected by a city
you try to protect.

07:09.902 --> 07:11.802
I never said I was rejected
by my city.

07:13.538 --> 07:14.971

but I got some real problems.

14:15.062 --> 14:17.596
All right,
here's the situation.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.032
We have one more job to do

14:20.167 --> 14:22.529
and that's to keep this bridge
from collapsing.

Have you ever no...

14:51.196 --> 14:52.927
I'm gonna go check
on the kids.

14:53.062 --> 14:54.967
[Freddy] Yeah, you should.
God only knows
what they're up to.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.799

Probably taking selfies

15:53.525 --> 15:56.229
Not saving is different
than breaking. Am I wrong?

15:56.365 --> 15:59.096
Am I wrong about this? Also,
we saved countless lives.

15:59.232 --> 16:02.030
A hundred sixty-two.
It's countable.

All right, big day,

16:51.782 --> 16:54.484
big bridge,
kind of a couple blunders,
right?

16:54.619 --> 16:56.716
But we're gonna meditate
on those mistakes right now.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.456
Mary?

17:02.161 --> 17:03.827
Organic chem is my meditation.

[Shazam chuckles]

17:05.298 --> 17:07.164
Said nobody with friends ever,
really.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.867
In point of fact,
I'd have friends

17:10.003 --> 17:11.335
if I had gone to college.

17:11.471 --> 17:13.137
[Shazam] In point of fact
is exactly the kind of

17:13.273 --> 17:14.435
smart thing
that a smart person

17:14.571 --> 17:15.869
who doesn't need
to go to college says.

17:16.005 --> 17:17.336
So,

17:17.472 --> 17:18.909
let's go back to the tape.

17:19.045 --> 17:20.510
Now, guys, as you can see,

17:20.645 --> 17:23.380
we started off real, real,
real, real strong, right?

17:23.516 --> 17:26.183

cohesiveness, energy,

17:26.319 --> 17:27.953
-terrific!
-[cell phone ringing]

17:28.089 --> 17:31.124
Oh, sorry, Coach.
Gotta fly IRL.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.487
No, no, no, I'm not done
with the presentation.

17:32.623 --> 17:34.227
I know. And I love
these daily recaps.

17:34.362 --> 17:36.427
I just gotta spread my wings
a bit before dinner.

17:36.562 --> 17:38.529
-It helps keep me loose!
-Okay, fine, fine. No recap.

17:38.665 --> 17:40.065
We'll go have a group hang
in the air. That sounds great.

17:40.201 --> 17:41.594
I gotta test this slime
for toxicity

17:41.729 --> 17:43.762
'cause I'm starting to...
tingle.

17:43.898 --> 17:46.766
Oh. The, uh, Phillies game
just came on

17:46.901 --> 17:50.009
so I'm gonna go ahead
and, uh, watch baseball.

17:50.145 --> 17:52.442
It's right that I give
Tawny back.

17:53.908 --> 17:55.479
[Shazam] Oh, come on!
What is happening?

17:55.614 --> 17:57.509
What is happening right now?
All or none, guys!

17:57.645 --> 17:58.980
If you say you have to work...

17:59.115 --> 18:00.484
I have to work.

18:00.619 --> 18:02.549
[sighs, chuckles]
Why do you even have a job?

18:02.685 --> 18:03.954
Wonder Woman
doesn't have a job!

18:04.089 --> 18:05.422
-Stop.
-No, seriously.

18:05.558 --> 18:06.618
Do you think she wears
a ponytail and glasses

18:06.754 --> 18:08.293
and, like, nobody
recognizes her

18:08.429 --> 18:09.690
and she's, like, an accountant
or something?

18:09.825 --> 18:11.991
Just stop.
You are holding on too tight.

18:12.126 --> 18:14.827
Just 'cause Freddy wants
to fly solo for ten minutes

18:14.963 --> 18:17.430
doesn't mean he's gonna
leave you like your mom.

18:17.566 --> 18:19.368
Or me wanting to go to college

18:19.504 --> 18:21.002
means I'm abandoning
the family.

18:21.137 --> 18:22.472
Oh. Okay, cool,

18:22.608 --> 18:24.609
it's about college again.
I totally get it.

18:24.744 --> 18:25.671
Yeah.

18:25.807 --> 18:27.611
Do you really
not see yourself?

18:27.747 --> 18:28.742
[sighs]

18:34.582 --> 18:36.114
You turn 18 in five months.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.283
They're not gonna kick me out.
They didn't kick you out.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.126
Victor and Rosa
are saints, yes,
but you're about to age out

18:41.262 --> 18:42.854
of the foster system
just like I did.

18:42.990 --> 18:45.860
Yeah, I get it.
I know how it works, okay?

18:45.996 --> 18:47.200
Do you?

18:48.302 --> 18:50.634
Victor and Rosa
can barely pay rent.

18:50.770 --> 18:53.569
And the state no longer sends
checks to feed or house me

18:53.704 --> 18:55.934
and soon there will be
no checks for you.

18:57.037 --> 19:00.406
I don't care if Wonder Woman
has a job.

19:00.541 --> 19:02.144
I want to contribute.

19:02.280 --> 19:03.843
At some point, Billy, like

19:03.979 --> 19:06.615
everyone on Earth,
we have to get a job or...

19:07.216 --> 19:08.419
leave home.

19:14.357 --> 19:15.822
Nothing lasts forever.

19:21.562 --> 19:23.964
[door opens, closes]

19:24.099 --> 19:27.768
I mean, it's literally called
the Rock of Eternity.

19:30.740 --> 19:33.739
So, clearly, some things
do last forever.

[magic resonating]

20:26.327 --> 20:27.326
Magic.

20:27.461 --> 20:29.235
Impossible.

20:29.371 --> 20:31.437
This realm was sealed off
from magic.

20:31.572 --> 20:36.173
Yes. After you ripped it
from our father's very core.

20:36.309 --> 20:39.006
From every god in this realm.

20:39.142 --> 20:40.405
From me.

20:40.541 --> 20:43.248
[bar sizzling]

20:43.383 --> 20:45.479
Do you not remember
what you took?

20:45.615 --> 20:48.448
What my particular power was?

20:48.583 --> 20:50.851
The power of elements.

20:50.986 --> 20:54.587
No. I cast a barrier
to prevent your kind

20:54.723 --> 20:56.594
from entering the human realm.

20:56.730 --> 20:58.996
The only way that barrier
could be removed is if--

20:59.132 --> 21:00.663
Someone broke this?

21:02.331 --> 21:03.529
How did...

21:03.664 --> 21:05.197
Where is the Champion?

21:05.333 --> 21:08.106
It was your hands that forged
this staff for our father

21:08.241 --> 21:10.409
and yours that will mend it.

21:10.544 --> 21:13.874
I told you
I would die before I help you.

Never. Never!

Never say never.

is what I meant to say.
Voice crack. It's weird.

Oh, no, no worries. If it
makes you feel any better

23:15.228 --> 23:16.533
it's nothing compared
to the amount

23:16.668 --> 23:17.798
that you're blushing
right now.

-chlamydia, they got it.

Yeah, he doesn't know
where he belongs.

Sure I do. I don't belong
in that trash can.

why you fell.

Jeez, thanks Mr. Geckle.

24:10.754 --> 24:12.119
Don't sweat it. That trash can

when I went here.

You knew those guys
were gonna hit you,

24:19.630 --> 24:21.227
but you stepped in anyway.

24:21.362 --> 24:23.596
You know something?
That's how I amuse myself.

24:24.967 --> 24:27.599

I get punched.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.041
[both chuckling]

24:29.177 --> 24:30.642
Well, it made me laugh.

24:31.506 --> 24:32.809
So...

24:36.943 --> 24:38.716
-[chuckles]
-Hero.

24:40.318 --> 24:41.521
[mouthing]

24:42.689 --> 24:44.754
You gonna walk me to class,
or what?

24:44.889 --> 24:46.018
Why would I...
Walk you to class? No.

24:46.153 --> 24:48.357
Why would I wanna do that?
Yes!

24:48.492 --> 24:49.991
Thanks. [chuckles]

24:50.626 --> 24:51.991
So, from the top.

24:52.127 --> 24:55.162
What is Thundercrack's
Make-A-Wish kid?

24:55.297 --> 24:59.231
Yeah. Um, it's real inside
baseball, but basically,

24:59.366 --> 25:01.837
a while ago I happened
to have some lunch

25:01.972 --> 25:03.841
in the cafeteria
with a few superheroes.

25:03.976 --> 25:06.872
Wait, the kid who's friends
with superheroes.

25:07.007 --> 25:08.413
-That was you?
-Yeah.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.044
And they're still dicks
to you?

25:10.179 --> 25:11.650
Sadly, just 'cause
you know someone cool,

25:11.785 --> 25:13.978
doesn't really necessarily
make you cool.

25:14.113 --> 25:15.786
You seem pretty cool to me.

25:18.422 --> 25:19.625
[loudly] Freddy!

25:21.392 --> 25:22.727
Is my name.

25:22.863 --> 25:25.527
Sorry, that was weird
and loud. I'm Freddy,

25:25.663 --> 25:27.230
he said in a normal voice.

25:27.365 --> 25:28.568
I'm Anne.

25:30.433 --> 25:31.534
Anne.

25:31.670 --> 25:32.765
-[grunts]
-[chuckles]

25:32.901 --> 25:34.033
-Nice!
-Bullseye.

25:34.169 --> 25:35.942
Hey, you gotta fix
that crutch, bro!

25:36.077 --> 25:37.071
[chuckles]

25:37.506 --> 25:38.943
What?

25:39.079 --> 25:40.074
[sighs]

25:41.842 --> 25:43.308
[chuckles lightly]

25:46.318 --> 25:47.252
[wizard gasping]

25:47.388 --> 25:49.589
[unsettling music playing]

26:03.136 --> 26:04.131
[grunts]

26:08.273 --> 26:09.268
[groans]

26:10.444 --> 26:12.645
[speaking other language]

26:14.342 --> 26:18.112
[in English] Good, little one.
Well done.

26:18.248 --> 26:21.346
Now go find me the one
responsible for this.

26:23.523 --> 26:25.691
[captivating music playing]

26:36.929 --> 26:38.336
[cork pops]

26:38.471 --> 26:40.198
Wow. Um... [chuckles]

26:40.334 --> 26:43.140
I'm flattered
that you feel this way.

26:43.276 --> 26:46.276
Truly, I mean, you know, like,
look at all this, you know...

26:46.411 --> 26:48.274
Romantic setting

26:48.409 --> 26:50.876
and fancy champagne,
big plates, tiny food.

26:51.012 --> 26:52.817
I mean, you went all out.

26:53.619 --> 26:55.616
I love that, I, I, I, I do.

26:55.751 --> 26:57.219
I'm just not sure

26:57.354 --> 26:59.186
that I'm really ready
to commit right now, you know.

26:59.322 --> 27:01.687
Wait, wait, wait.
No, this isn't about you.

27:01.822 --> 27:06.326
I promise this is
not about you. Okay?
Look... [chuckles]

27:06.461 --> 27:08.496
I know the whole world wants
to see this happen.

27:08.631 --> 27:09.999
You and me.

27:10.134 --> 27:13.970
The dynamic duo.
The hottie goddies. [chuckles]

27:14.570 --> 27:16.806
She-zam.

27:16.942 --> 27:19.105
I guess I'm just afraid
that I'm...

27:19.240 --> 27:21.879
gonna let 'em all down.
You know?

27:23.176 --> 27:24.409
That I'm gonna let you down.

27:29.185 --> 27:31.456
You know what?
Screw it. Let's try.

27:31.591 --> 27:32.956
Let's try this crazy thing.

27:33.987 --> 27:35.189
Maybe we'll, uh...

27:37.728 --> 27:39.124
seal it with a kiss?

27:39.259 --> 27:41.459
[sentimental piano music
playing]

27:52.977 --> 27:54.413
-Billy Batson!
-[Shazam screams]

27:54.549 --> 27:56.440
You are a fool of a champion.

27:56.576 --> 27:58.750
What the hell...
What the hell is going on?

27:58.885 --> 28:00.114
What happened
to her beautiful face?

28:00.250 --> 28:01.786
Also, aren't you,
like, dead-ass dead?

28:01.922 --> 28:03.987
I bring a warning
from beyond your realm.

28:04.122 --> 28:05.983
The daughters of Atlas
are coming for you.

28:06.119 --> 28:07.219
Daughters of Atlas?

28:07.354 --> 28:08.793
They're coming to unmake
your world

28:08.928 --> 28:11.557
and torture mankind
for all eternity

28:11.693 --> 28:14.567
-in the Pit of Endless Agony.
-Okay, I feel like maybe

28:14.702 --> 28:15.664
I should be writing
all this down.

28:15.800 --> 28:16.865
-Quiet!
-Okay, okay.

28:17.001 --> 28:18.833
You don't know
what you've done.

28:18.968 --> 28:20.865
I regret ever choosing you.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.435
Because of you,

28:22.570 --> 28:24.676
the barrier between the world
has been brought down.

28:24.812 --> 28:26.344
They will be hunting
for you now.

28:26.480 --> 28:27.472
Hunting your family.

28:30.516 --> 28:31.784
[Shazam] Hmm?

28:31.919 --> 28:34.687
Oh, they're coming.
Listen to me, Billy.

28:34.822 --> 28:37.051
The fate of your world
depends on it.

28:37.187 --> 28:39.317
One thing you absolutely
must not allow

28:39.453 --> 28:41.756
the daughters of Atlas
to do is...

28:41.891 --> 28:43.455
-[screams]
-[gasps]

28:46.830 --> 28:48.768
[breathing heavily]

28:48.903 --> 28:51.331
-[mysterious music playing]
-[crackling]

28:56.775 --> 28:58.173
-[shatters]
-[gasps]

29:02.481 --> 29:03.641
Hey, Freddy?

29:03.776 --> 29:05.818
-[dog barking in distance]
-[crickets chirping]

29:07.551 --> 29:08.546
[sighs]

29:14.894 --> 29:18.326
[Freddy] Nope, over it.
Done it.

29:18.461 --> 29:21.097
Check fraud? What,
are you kidding me? [gasps]

29:21.798 --> 29:23.330
Armored car heist?

29:23.465 --> 29:25.799
[chuckles] I think I got that
in the bag.

29:25.935 --> 29:27.705
[rock music playing]

29:27.841 --> 29:29.875
-Shazam!
-[lightning cracks]

29:35.381 --> 29:36.376
Whoo!

29:37.043 --> 29:38.246
[Freddy scoffs]

29:39.782 --> 29:41.183
Bon appetit.

29:42.553 --> 29:43.789
Hi.

29:43.925 --> 29:46.491
-Oh, hi! Yes, I mean, hi.
-Hi. [chuckles]

29:46.626 --> 29:47.893
Um, you wanna show me

29:48.028 --> 29:50.027
where you were sitting
when it happened?

29:51.996 --> 29:53.292
Oh, yeah, of course. Totally.

29:53.427 --> 29:55.164
-Yeah. Follow me.
-Okay, yeah.

29:55.299 --> 29:57.600
So, basically,
it's a table down at the end.

29:57.736 --> 29:59.938
[people chattering]

30:01.741 --> 30:03.173
So I was sitting, yeah...

30:03.309 --> 30:05.706
Basically, I was sitting
right here, and he was sitting

30:05.841 --> 30:07.076
right there.

30:07.212 --> 30:08.173
-Here? [chuckles]
-Right there, yeah.

30:08.309 --> 30:10.177
[cell phone vibrates, chimes]

30:10.312 --> 30:11.882
Oh, sorry.
Overbearing brother.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.948
Oh, I have one of those.
Uh, a sister.

30:14.084 --> 30:15.148
Always has to know where I am.

30:15.283 --> 30:16.447
-Right.
-[cell phone chiming]

30:16.583 --> 30:17.921
-I feel that, clearly.
-[chuckles]

30:18.057 --> 30:19.453
Always thinks she knows
better, too.

30:19.588 --> 30:21.124
Even when it's been
factually proven otherwise?

30:21.260 --> 30:22.754
Exactly. And it's not
that I don't love her.

30:22.890 --> 30:25.159
No, of course. It'd just be
nice not to have someone--

30:25.295 --> 30:26.891
Constantly breathing
down your neck.

30:27.027 --> 30:28.933
-From the moment you wake up!
-'Cause I'm not a kid anymore.

30:29.069 --> 30:31.300
No! I'm a month younger,
one month exactly.

30:31.435 --> 30:33.305
And do we have to do
every single thing together?

30:33.440 --> 30:35.202
[both] No!

30:35.338 --> 30:37.475
-[both chuckle]
-[footsteps approaching]

30:37.610 --> 30:39.609
Oh! Billy! What...

30:39.745 --> 30:41.010
What a coinkidink! Um...

30:41.146 --> 30:43.014
I was just telling
my friend Anne

30:43.150 --> 30:45.917
-what a great guy you are.
-We need to talk.

30:46.052 --> 30:47.379
We need to talk.
This guy loves to talk.

30:47.514 --> 30:49.252
-He's a great talker.
-Freddy.

30:49.388 --> 30:51.990
-I have to talk to him.
I'll be right back.
-Okay.

30:53.425 --> 30:55.627
Wait, didn't you tell us
the wizard disintegrated?

30:55.763 --> 30:56.894
The skin peeled off his face.

30:57.030 --> 30:58.764
He turned into a literal
pile of ash.

30:58.899 --> 31:00.898
-Yeah, seems definitive.
-I dunno.

31:01.034 --> 31:04.068
Yeah. Except now
he's in my dreams

31:04.203 --> 31:05.631
and, Freddy, he's trying
to give me a message.

31:05.767 --> 31:07.267
[snaps fingers] Could be
astral projection powers.

31:07.403 --> 31:09.502
-What's that?
-Obi-Wan Kenobi-ing you

31:09.637 --> 31:11.337
-from the great beyond?
-That's it, I'm calling

31:11.473 --> 31:13.011
an emergency meeting
after school.

31:13.147 --> 31:15.007
-I want you there.
-Where else am I gonna go?

31:15.143 --> 31:16.307
-What?
-Dude.

31:16.443 --> 31:18.412
[Freddy reading indistinctly]

31:18.547 --> 31:20.679
Okay, first of all,
I didn't explode it!

31:20.814 --> 31:22.350
All right? It was already
like that and, and, and...

31:22.485 --> 31:23.919
What is that, the<i> Tribune?</i>
It's fake news!

31:24.055 --> 31:25.556
Freddy, we only have one rule.

31:25.692 --> 31:26.858
[both] All or none.

31:26.994 --> 31:28.190
And it's a stupid rule,
by the way.

31:28.325 --> 31:29.895
I have a girl talking
to me, Billy.

31:30.031 --> 31:31.559
A girl. For the first time
in my life!

31:31.695 --> 31:33.729
And I probably don't have
a shot in hell with this girl,

31:33.865 --> 31:35.298
but I'll never find out

31:35.433 --> 31:36.767
if you keep trying to control
everything I wanna do!

31:36.902 --> 31:38.129
Just be at the Rock, Freddy.

31:38.264 --> 31:41.202
[sighs] Okay. Mmm.

31:41.337 --> 31:43.607
By the way, uh,
she has a sister.

31:43.743 --> 31:45.007
Total control freak.

31:45.142 --> 31:46.405
I think you guys
would get along.

31:46.541 --> 31:48.307
Think you'd love her,
actually.

31:48.442 --> 31:49.679
[Shazam]<i> Look, look, look. Fam,</i>

31:49.815 --> 31:51.113
I know it sounds crazy.

31:51.248 --> 31:52.882
And, and obviously
I don't know

31:53.017 --> 31:54.884
exactly what this all means

31:55.019 --> 31:56.518
but, but he was super aggro

31:56.654 --> 31:58.657
and super loud and he was
trying to warn us, I think.

31:58.793 --> 32:00.091
He was yelling about all this

32:00.226 --> 32:01.693
wizard-y mumbo-jumbo
about realms and stuff.

32:01.828 --> 32:04.227
Do you have to talk so loud?

32:04.362 --> 32:06.024
Yeah, Mary, 'cause this is not
that loud.

32:06.159 --> 32:09.065
I think this is
a perfectly acceptable
indoor voice volume.

32:09.201 --> 32:10.464
What is the deal?
Are you okay?

32:10.599 --> 32:13.500
-Yeah.
-Why do you have
sunglasses on?

32:13.635 --> 32:15.037
Did you go to the eye doctor
this morning?

32:15.173 --> 32:16.737
-[snorts]
-[Shazam chuckles]

32:16.872 --> 32:19.374
I dunno, it looks to me like
Mary did go to the eye doctor,

32:19.510 --> 32:22.211
but it was last night,
and she had a lot of fun.

32:22.347 --> 32:25.249
In point of fact,
I did have a great time.

32:25.384 --> 32:28.216
I met other people my age
and I enjoyed myself.

32:28.351 --> 32:30.686
You made friends
at the eye doctor?

32:30.821 --> 32:32.121
No, she...

32:32.257 --> 32:33.757
Yeah, can we get back
on track?

32:33.893 --> 32:35.257
Listen, he's yelling at me

32:35.393 --> 32:37.255
and he's saying the daughters
of Atlas

32:37.390 --> 32:39.225
are coming to hunt us.

32:39.360 --> 32:40.592
So, check out what I found.

32:40.728 --> 32:42.260
"The daughters of Atlas
are the offspring

32:42.395 --> 32:43.700
of the Titan Atlas..."

32:43.835 --> 32:45.203
which is obvious,

32:45.338 --> 32:49.304
but also Nyx, the Goddess
of Night and Death.

32:49.440 --> 32:51.842
Well, good things
can happen at night.

32:51.977 --> 32:53.577
-And death.
-[sighs]

32:53.712 --> 32:55.240
Let me see this.

32:55.376 --> 32:57.577
[intriguing music playing]

33:00.385 --> 33:03.288
"The daughters
guard the mythic Tree of Life

33:03.424 --> 33:07.056
which grows golden apples
that contain the seeds of life

33:07.191 --> 33:09.022
which gave birth
to their realm

33:09.157 --> 33:10.689
protected by a...

33:11.491 --> 33:13.492
-dragon."
-Hey, now.

33:13.628 --> 33:14.862
And I am suddenly here
for this.

33:14.998 --> 33:16.366
I know, right?

33:16.501 --> 33:17.695
'Cause, like, on one hand,
totally terrifying.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.736
-On the other hand, dragon!
-Dragon!

33:19.872 --> 33:21.304
Mary. What are we doin'?

33:21.439 --> 33:23.935
I don't know, man.
This is your meeting.

33:24.071 --> 33:26.809
Right, yes, fine, but we all
need to be on the same page

33:26.945 --> 33:28.410
and, and, and look,

33:28.545 --> 33:31.076
I often think that you think
better than me.

33:31.212 --> 33:34.846
The wizard
did not exactly give me
a tutorial here, guys, okay?

33:34.981 --> 33:37.121
Like, I don't know
how a lot of this stuff works.

33:37.256 --> 33:38.985
That, that room of doors,
or that violin

33:39.121 --> 33:41.719
that is, like,
constantly burning
which is super weird but also

33:41.855 --> 33:43.359
definitely keeps
the lair cozy, right?

33:43.494 --> 33:46.426
He didn't even tell me
my superhero name.

33:46.561 --> 33:48.693
And it's not like
I'm not tryin'.

33:48.828 --> 33:51.400
But I really,
really need your help.

33:52.601 --> 33:56.405
Uh, I might know somebody
that can help.

34:01.276 --> 34:03.207
Shut up. That lights up?

34:03.342 --> 34:05.449
[rumbling]

34:05.585 --> 34:07.581
Shut up.

34:14.862 --> 34:16.854
[enchanting music playing]

34:40.352 --> 34:42.149
So, I'm mapping out
the entire lair

34:42.284 --> 34:43.717
and you withhold this?

34:43.852 --> 34:44.821
[Shazam] And you have really
been holding out on us.

34:44.956 --> 34:45.883
Jeez Louise, dude.

34:48.194 --> 34:50.160
-Whoa!
-[Shazam] "Whoa" what?

34:50.296 --> 34:51.691
-"Whoa" what?
-[superhero Darla] Look!

34:51.826 --> 34:53.528
-[superhero Darla chuckles]
-Hey, Steve.

34:54.631 --> 34:56.827
[chuckles] What?
You call the pen "Steve"?

34:56.963 --> 34:58.600
Yeah, I thought he looked
like a "Steve."

34:58.736 --> 35:00.601
[superhero Darla] He totally
looks like a "Steve."

35:02.270 --> 35:05.942
-"'Crime and Punishment,'
a book report by Pedro Pena?"
-Yeah.

35:06.078 --> 35:08.313
-[Shazam laughs]
-Pedro.

35:08.449 --> 35:11.279
-Dude, that's cheating.
-I mean, he knows everything.

35:11.414 --> 35:13.885
-Hmm.
-Seriously. Ask him.

35:14.020 --> 35:15.319
You can just ask him stuff?

35:15.454 --> 35:16.681
-Pretty much.
-[Shazam] Slick. Okay, cool.

35:16.817 --> 35:19.451
Steve, we're looking
for information

35:19.587 --> 35:21.488
about the daughters of Atlas.

35:21.624 --> 35:23.822
Can you please help us
with that?

35:30.864 --> 35:32.732
-These are book titles.
-[Shazam] Okay.

35:32.867 --> 35:34.337
Let's just all pick a book,
or something.

35:34.473 --> 35:36.907
Where's Freddy?
I mean, obscure mythology?

35:37.042 --> 35:38.575
Definitely his thing.

35:38.711 --> 35:41.543
I'm not even sure Freddy knows
what his thing is anymore.

35:42.982 --> 35:45.184
[people chattering]

35:46.817 --> 35:49.079
You know I've actually never,
never been up here.

35:49.214 --> 35:51.618
Don't lie. [chuckles]
This is where you hang out

35:51.754 --> 35:53.891
with your superhero friends,
isn't it?

35:54.027 --> 35:56.360
No, actually, why would
they ever have to...
Why would they ever come here?

35:56.495 --> 35:58.129
I mean they have, yes,
they've driven by...

35:58.265 --> 35:59.859
Do you actually know
those guys?

35:59.995 --> 36:03.167
Or is this like
a "Canadian girlfriend"
situation?

36:03.303 --> 36:04.399
Oh, you mean Collette?
Well, she and I

36:04.534 --> 36:06.132
aren't really exclusive,
as of now.

36:06.267 --> 36:07.503
[chuckles]

36:09.571 --> 36:10.770
Do you wanna meet one of them?

36:11.371 --> 36:12.405
Meet, like how?

36:12.541 --> 36:14.246
Like, face-to-face, right now.

36:15.181 --> 36:16.343
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

36:16.478 --> 36:17.643
And today is your lucky day,

36:17.779 --> 36:19.878
because I'm gonna call
the hot one.

36:20.786 --> 36:22.053
Her?

36:22.189 --> 36:23.816
-No, the male hot one.
-Him?

36:24.989 --> 36:26.424
What? Him?

36:26.559 --> 36:28.118
Look, I mean, it's all
subjective, right? But, um...

36:28.253 --> 36:30.421
Captain Everypower usually
tops most online polls

36:30.557 --> 36:32.291
so... It's no big deal.

36:32.427 --> 36:34.127
Is this a joke, Freddy?

36:34.263 --> 36:37.434
'Cause I didn't mean
to make you
actually prove it, really.

36:40.637 --> 36:42.099
No, it's not a joke.
And I'm gonna

36:42.235 --> 36:44.142
call him right now.
I'm gonna call him right now.

36:44.278 --> 36:47.277
So, don't move.
So, stay right there.

36:47.413 --> 36:49.310
Hey, Captain Everypower.
What's goin' on?

36:49.445 --> 36:51.942
It's your boy Freddy. Yeah.

36:52.077 --> 36:53.314
Remember that time
I saved your life?

36:53.449 --> 36:54.652
No, no, no, the other time.

36:54.787 --> 36:55.846
Yeah.

36:55.982 --> 36:58.719
Well, I'm calling in
that favor.

37:01.455 --> 37:03.927
[lightning cracks]

37:04.063 --> 37:05.858
[heroic music plays]

37:07.560 --> 37:09.097
You must be Anne.

37:09.233 --> 37:12.029
[gasps] Oh, my God.

37:13.304 --> 37:14.766
Friend of Freddy's, I hear.

37:14.902 --> 37:17.969
I am, actually. Yeah.
How are you...

37:20.945 --> 37:23.814
[sighs] You know, I may be
the one with the superpowers,

37:23.950 --> 37:24.948
but that kid,

37:25.084 --> 37:26.378
he's the real hero.

37:26.514 --> 37:28.483
Yeah. I mean, honestly,

37:28.619 --> 37:30.216
I've never met anyone
like him.

37:30.351 --> 37:32.518
He's... genuine

37:32.654 --> 37:35.325
and warm and funny. [chuckles]

37:35.461 --> 37:37.362
-That's a lot of nice things.
-Yeah.

37:39.098 --> 37:40.292
How did you two meet?

37:40.427 --> 37:41.429
Comic Con.

37:41.564 --> 37:43.433
-What's Comic Con?
-What?

37:43.569 --> 37:44.696
[superhero Mary]
<i> According to this,</i>

37:44.832 --> 37:47.168
gods considered
humans servants,

37:47.304 --> 37:49.104
toys to be played with,

37:49.240 --> 37:50.771
children to be punished.

37:52.541 --> 37:53.973
[chuckles] Thanks, Steve.

37:54.109 --> 37:56.610
Until the rebellion when
the humans turned on the gods.

37:56.746 --> 37:58.313
I'm reading about that
right now.

37:58.448 --> 37:59.844
So, apparently, all of this

37:59.979 --> 38:02.150
revolves around
a powerful weapon.

38:02.286 --> 38:03.948
So Atlas, uh, the father

38:04.084 --> 38:06.183
of the daughters of Atlas,
obviously, yeah,

38:06.318 --> 38:08.087
he crafted a quarterstaff
from the Tree of Life

38:08.223 --> 38:10.824
and he used that staff to
give powers to certain deities

38:10.959 --> 38:13.764
but also to take powers away
from others.

38:13.899 --> 38:17.194
So, the staff's where Atlas
stored all supernatural power.

38:17.329 --> 38:21.268
Yes, exactly. It's like a,
a battery for magic.

38:21.404 --> 38:22.804
But when things got bad,

38:22.939 --> 38:25.769
a council of human wizards
got together and they

38:25.904 --> 38:27.345
stole the staff from Atlas.

38:27.481 --> 38:29.043
And they used that to take
his powers away.

38:29.178 --> 38:30.578
And once they had his magic
they went after other gods...

38:30.714 --> 38:32.184
Guys, that's the wizard!
I know this guy,

38:32.319 --> 38:34.116
this is the wizard
that I know!

38:34.251 --> 38:35.585
What do these say?

38:41.061 --> 38:42.119
"The Wisdom of Solomon,

38:42.254 --> 38:43.789
Strength of Hercules,
Stamina of Atlas,

38:43.925 --> 38:45.563
Power of Zeus,
Courage of Achilles,

38:45.699 --> 38:48.125
Speed of Mercury." These are
the powers they stole.

38:49.363 --> 38:50.567
No.

38:52.434 --> 38:53.368
Whoa, guys, look!

38:53.503 --> 38:54.902
This is what the name means.

38:55.037 --> 38:56.540
Which is way cooler
than what I thought it was,

38:56.675 --> 38:58.370
which is just a bunch
of hot garbage, so.

38:58.506 --> 39:01.845
If I may point out one
of the powers
that may be possibly MIA.

39:01.980 --> 39:03.277
Boop.

39:03.413 --> 39:04.379
[Shazam] I'm sorry,

39:04.515 --> 39:06.284
are you very unsubtly implying

39:06.420 --> 39:09.053
that I somehow lack
the wisdom of

39:09.189 --> 39:11.049
-Solo Man?
-Yeah.

39:11.851 --> 39:13.557
Well, maybe it comes later.

39:13.692 --> 39:15.555
I mean you do usually ask Mary
what to do.

39:15.690 --> 39:16.622
-I'm just saying.
-Yeah.

39:16.757 --> 39:17.922
This is very, very hurtful.

39:18.058 --> 39:19.295
I just want you all
to know that.

39:19.431 --> 39:20.693
And it's pronounced "Solomon."

39:20.828 --> 39:22.267
-Oh.
-[Shazam clears throat]

39:22.403 --> 39:23.865
What else
have we learned, fam?

39:24.001 --> 39:28.232
Well, once the staff contained
the powers of the gods,

39:28.367 --> 39:32.943
the wizards apparently
encased the God Realm in some

39:33.079 --> 39:35.045
magical sphere

39:35.181 --> 39:36.948
sealing it away forever.

39:37.084 --> 39:38.943
Cut off from magic.

39:39.078 --> 39:41.047
Oh, so that's what
that was about.

39:41.182 --> 39:44.687
Yeah, I don't think that
they are so cut off anymore.

39:46.660 --> 39:48.658
<i> A bizarre and gruesome scene</i>
<i> unfolded</i>

39:48.793 --> 39:50.388
<i> in Athens, Greece</i>
<i> this morning.</i>

39:50.524 --> 39:52.558
<i> Two women dressed in what</i>
<i> appears to be ancient Greek...</i>

39:52.693 --> 39:54.631
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's the wizard's staff.
How did they get that?

39:54.766 --> 39:56.293
So, all those statues
used to be people.

39:56.428 --> 40:00.499
I'm wondering, how did
the staff end up in Europe,

40:00.635 --> 40:01.935
where Greece is at?

40:03.335 --> 40:06.978
Oh, gee-whiz, mister,
sorry I took your cane.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.139
You want it back?

40:11.785 --> 40:13.816
I mean, I did break it in half
and then throw it away.

40:13.951 --> 40:16.285
So, that's probably
where the journey started.

40:16.421 --> 40:17.553
-You know?
-What?

40:17.689 --> 40:18.952
What do you mean,
"What?" What?

40:19.087 --> 40:20.691
-You just left it there?
-We were all there.

40:20.826 --> 40:22.655
Guys, I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers.

40:22.790 --> 40:24.289
You're welcome, by the way.

40:24.425 --> 40:25.792
And then I had to break it
in half so Sivana didn't do

40:25.928 --> 40:27.999
super bad-guy stuff with it,
okay?

40:28.135 --> 40:29.259
You broke the staff,

40:29.394 --> 40:31.398
meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds.

40:31.533 --> 40:32.667
Which we now know.

40:32.803 --> 40:34.397
We also now know
what they look like,

40:34.533 --> 40:36.437
so when they come to hunt us,
we'll see those two

40:36.573 --> 40:37.501
-coming a--
-Three.

40:37.636 --> 40:38.840
What?

40:40.445 --> 40:42.211
Atlas had three daughters.

just a superhero.

40:55.195 --> 40:56.660
I'm a super listener.

40:57.458 --> 40:58.864
And...

40:58.999 --> 41:00.125
I sense...

41:01.294 --> 41:03.764
that you may have feelings
for Freddy.

41:03.900 --> 41:05.999
Just wanna know
when he's coming back.

41:06.801 --> 41:08.167
Don't want him to get hurt.

41:08.302 --> 41:11.372
Oh, well, Anne... [sighs]
I mean, we can't choose

41:11.508 --> 41:13.174
the people we fall for.

41:13.309 --> 41:14.674
What?

41:14.809 --> 41:16.240
I'm not talking about that.

41:16.375 --> 41:19.316
If he shows up now,
he's in serious danger.

41:19.451 --> 41:21.419
Whoa! Look who you're with.

41:21.555 --> 41:23.150
What could possibly
be dangerous?

41:23.286 --> 41:24.281

41:26.454 --> 41:28.124
Okay.

44:20.695 --> 44:21.930

...and I will snap
this child's neck.

[choking]

44:29.002 --> 44:31.204
[dramatic music playing]

44:52.991 --> 44:54.799
Oh, Freddy.

[magic resonating]

45:37.438 --> 45:38.942
[Freddy in English]
Billy, stay back!

45:39.077 --> 45:40.504
They're using the staff
to take our powers.

45:46.880 --> 45:48.853
[grunts, gasps]

45:49.687 --> 45:52.186
What? What? [gasps]

[yells]

46:07.702 --> 46:08.906
Sorry!

46:11.478 --> 46:12.469
[Freddy] I'm sorry,

46:12.604 --> 46:14.042
I'm sorry, just,
just save yourself.

46:14.178 --> 46:16.474
No, no, all or none.
We stick together.

46:16.610 --> 46:19.413
And that you will
because you cannot leave.

46:19.549 --> 46:23.283
Let's see how you like being
sealed off in a dying world.

46:23.818 --> 46:25.716
[Freddy] No!

46:25.852 --> 46:26.849
No!

46:26.985 --> 46:28.189
Freddy!

-[wizard] I'm trying to sleep.

It is the only escape

Okay. Bleak.

47:27.487 --> 47:28.982
Wait a second.

47:29.117 --> 47:31.187
Hagrid beard, Batman voice.

47:31.322 --> 47:33.892
You're the wizard.
You're the wizard! Oh, my...

47:34.027 --> 47:35.285
You're back! Billy told me
all about you.

47:35.421 --> 47:37.423
Billy? You know Billy Batson?

47:37.558 --> 47:39.129
Billy Batson. Yeah,
he's my best friend.

47:39.264 --> 47:41.064
I'm... I'm Freddy Freeman,
Captain Everypower.

47:41.199 --> 47:42.994
Well, used to be.
It's complicated now.

47:43.130 --> 47:44.530
She... It's complicated.

47:44.665 --> 47:46.933
That halfwit Billy
gave you the powers of Shazam?

47:47.069 --> 47:50.405
Yeah, he did. And he said
that you turned into ash,
but, but didn't?

47:50.541 --> 47:52.136
[grunts]

47:52.272 --> 47:53.470
Once I gave him the power,

47:53.606 --> 47:56.275
I could no longer remain
in my realm.

47:56.411 --> 47:58.047
But death would have
been a luxury

47:58.183 --> 48:00.051
compared to being trapped
in this cell

48:00.186 --> 48:02.617
with the knowledge
of my failure, and with you.

48:02.752 --> 48:03.954
Mostly with you.

48:04.089 --> 48:05.082
A little more sarcastic
than Billy said,

48:05.218 --> 48:06.785
but, hey, all good.

48:06.920 --> 48:09.085
-Let's just get out of here.
-"Let's just get out of here."

48:09.220 --> 48:10.422
Yeah, sure.

48:10.557 --> 48:12.124
I sound nothing like that,
but okay.

48:12.259 --> 48:13.457
Here's what we've got, um...

48:13.593 --> 48:15.832
A cranky wizard
with a cynical streak

48:15.967 --> 48:18.762
and a precocious young man
with an encyclopedic knowledge
regarding magical shit.

48:18.898 --> 48:22.799
There is no way these sisters
are keeping us in here.

48:22.934 --> 48:24.668
These prison bars,
they're probably enchanted!

48:24.804 --> 48:28.007
-What spells do you know?
-Please, stop talking.

48:28.143 --> 48:29.275
How about an arcane focus?

48:29.411 --> 48:30.874
I don't even know
what that is.

48:31.010 --> 48:32.179
[groans]

48:32.315 --> 48:33.744
Fine, then let's make
a potion.

48:33.879 --> 48:36.113
Like a potion of, um, giant
strength or diminution.

48:36.248 --> 48:37.715
Oh! Gaseous form!

48:37.851 --> 48:40.355
Yeah! Maybe we could
float out of here like a fart.

48:40.490 --> 48:44.193
I gave my powers to children
who squandered it.

48:45.028 --> 48:46.526
We will die here, Freeby.

48:46.662 --> 48:49.699
It's Freddy, by the way.
"Freeby"? Where do you even...

48:49.835 --> 48:51.398
The sooner you accept it,

48:52.100 --> 48:53.233
the easier it will be.

48:53.369 --> 48:56.205
Is this a tooth?
There's a tooth in here!

48:56.739 --> 48:57.674
Hmm.

48:57.810 --> 49:00.011
[foreboding music playing]

49:05.944 --> 49:09.046
[superhero Mary] "Power
of elements. Power of chaos.

49:09.181 --> 49:11.183
Power of axis."

49:11.318 --> 49:12.650
These are primordial forces.

49:12.786 --> 49:14.791
I don't know how we fight
powers like this.

49:14.926 --> 49:16.726
I tell you how we fight it.

49:16.861 --> 49:18.459
With the wisdom of...

49:19.128 --> 49:21.290
-Solomon.
-Exactly.

49:21.426 --> 49:23.199
We, we set up a meeting.

49:23.334 --> 49:25.562
Yeah, we tell 'em we want
to negotiate.

49:25.698 --> 49:27.936
Offer up our powers
for Freddy.

49:28.071 --> 49:29.667
But then we grab one of them

49:29.802 --> 49:31.535
and that's what we really use
to trade!

49:31.671 --> 49:33.276
But what if they steal
our powers?

49:33.411 --> 49:35.272
No, they won't, 'cause we know
how they work now.

49:35.408 --> 49:38.082
You know what I mean?
If they just point
that staff at us, we dodge.

49:38.217 --> 49:40.610
[imitates whooshing sounds]
Like dodgeball.

49:40.746 --> 49:43.019
-Hmm.
-Dude, I suck at dodgeball.

49:43.155 --> 49:45.050
Well, maybe Pedro sucks
at dodgeball,

49:45.186 --> 49:46.453
but not Super Pedro.

49:46.588 --> 49:48.625
No, Super Pedro also sucks
at dodgeball.

49:48.761 --> 49:51.657
Fine. Listen, all I know
is that there's five of us
and three of them.

49:51.793 --> 49:54.461
So I think we should
send them a little invitation.

49:56.865 --> 49:57.867
Okay.

49:58.003 --> 49:59.937
So, Steve says that this paper

50:00.073 --> 50:02.106
is a stack
of magical parchment.

50:02.241 --> 50:03.869
You write a message
on the magical paper

50:04.004 --> 50:07.076
and say the name of the god
that you would like to talk to

50:07.211 --> 50:09.745
and then the paper folds
into a...

50:09.881 --> 50:12.413
[gasps] Oh, my God, yes!

50:13.686 --> 50:14.981
A paper bird.

50:15.117 --> 50:16.516
And it flies to the god.

50:16.652 --> 50:18.455
[Super Hero Eugene] Well,
that's kinda cute.

50:18.591 --> 50:22.523
Hey, what about demigods? Uh,
you know, like, Wonder Woman?

50:22.658 --> 50:25.261
Do you think she's accepting
bird letters right now?

50:27.195 --> 50:28.528
Did the pen just shrug?

50:29.663 --> 50:31.630
Hey, Steve, do I just
dictate to...

50:32.565 --> 50:34.430
I do. Okay, cool, wad that up.

50:34.566 --> 50:36.107
All right. [clears throat]

50:37.170 --> 50:39.043
Letter...

50:39.179 --> 50:43.011
Letter, writing a letter.
No, no, no!

50:43.146 --> 50:44.645
I was just talking out loud.

50:44.781 --> 50:46.183
That's not a part
of the letter.
Wad that up, too.

50:47.351 --> 50:49.283
[superhero Darla]
Maybe if you try

50:49.419 --> 50:51.381
-speaking from the heart.
-Hmm.

51:18.750 --> 51:19.876
[Hespera] Child,

51:20.012 --> 51:22.111
I will spare your life
if you're honest with me.

51:22.247 --> 51:23.550
Honesty.

51:23.685 --> 51:27.554
Yeah, wow, very, um,
ironic subject choice.

51:28.256 --> 51:29.355
The other Champions...

51:29.491 --> 51:31.894
are they children
like yourself?

51:32.029 --> 51:33.593
What even is a child?

51:33.728 --> 51:36.666
I mean, I know I shave,
like, every week-ish.

51:36.801 --> 51:38.061
Yes or no?

51:38.196 --> 51:40.404
No. Your answer is no
because nobody's stupid enough

51:40.540 --> 51:43.868
to grant primordial god-like
powers to a bunch of kids.

51:44.004 --> 51:47.270
-Give us their names.
-The names of the Champions?

51:47.405 --> 51:51.642
Um, well, there's
Brett Breyer,
and, uh, Burke Breyer.

51:51.777 --> 51:53.179
Are you guys taking
this stuff in?

51:53.314 --> 51:54.784
Writing this down? No?

51:54.920 --> 51:55.982
They drive a Dodge Ram.

51:56.117 --> 51:57.219
He's lying.

51:57.354 --> 51:59.619
That's your superpower,
not mine.

51:59.754 --> 52:01.753
And she thinks
you're a total control freak.

52:02.860 --> 52:03.858
One of you.

52:03.994 --> 52:05.262
Probably you.

52:06.096 --> 52:08.159
-[gasps]
-Hold him.

52:08.294 --> 52:10.234
[soldier growls]

52:10.370 --> 52:12.465
[Freddy] Don't... [grunts]
What's happening?

52:12.601 --> 52:13.934
What is that?
What's she doing?

52:14.069 --> 52:15.404
Power of chaos.

52:15.540 --> 52:17.702
It enters a man's mind
and shatters it whole.

52:17.837 --> 52:20.440
Oh. [chuckles]
My mind is already trash,

52:20.576 --> 52:22.913
so I'd actually like
to see you try.

52:23.048 --> 52:25.081
Because nobody has the balls

52:25.216 --> 52:27.214
to handle what's
inside my brain.

52:27.350 --> 52:29.414
[whispering] Say their names.

-Say their names.
-Stop!

53:05.758 --> 53:06.986

53:07.121 --> 53:08.418
Stop.

53:08.554 --> 53:11.159

53:11.294 --> 53:12.857
This is from the Champions.

Thanks, Darla.

-We'd like to make a trade.
-What?

53:24.174 --> 53:25.505
We'll give up our powers

if you give us Freddy,
add 'unharmed.'

Otherwise, they're gonna
monkey's-paw you.

53:32.181 --> 53:33.411
Smart, Eugene.

53:33.546 --> 53:35.920
Steve, add 'unharmed'

53:36.055 --> 53:38.218
then, like, 'yours, trul...'

53:38.353 --> 53:40.850
No, 'Sincerely, best'.

53:40.986 --> 53:44.025
Maybe just signed
'The Champions.'

make mistakes,

53:48.166 --> 53:49.398
just writes what you say.

53:49.534 --> 53:52.970
Great. I feel good
about this. Me, too.

53:53.105 --> 53:55.937
Anyone else want a Gatorade?

53:56.072 --> 53:57.473

any longer.

to be trusted.

-Well, you must get up.
-For what?

54:51.993 --> 54:55.760
All this pretending
to be a superhero is just...

54:55.896 --> 54:57.966
a way for me to pretend
I'm not broken.

56:08.304 --> 56:09.435
[powers trilling]

56:09.571 --> 56:11.441
[Freddy breathing shakily]

56:11.576 --> 56:13.505
-[screams]
-You're okay! You're okay.

56:13.641 --> 56:15.278
I don't feel okay at all.

56:15.413 --> 56:17.745
That's the power
of the dragon.

56:17.880 --> 56:19.943
It emanates fear
from every pore of its body.

56:20.079 --> 56:22.245
Ladon's fear paralyzes
any mortal,

56:22.380 --> 56:24.950
so that none can approach
the garden it protects.

56:25.984 --> 56:28.391
Power of axis. Very cool, very,

56:28.526 --> 56:30.323
-very rare.
-[Hespera] Anthea!

56:30.459 --> 56:32.226
[Anthea] I must go.

56:32.361 --> 56:35.328
The door back to your world
is at the center
of the labyrinth.

56:35.463 --> 56:36.996
Right, left, left

56:37.132 --> 56:39.667
and then follow
the right-hand wall
to the center.

56:39.803 --> 56:41.504
-You'll need this.
-How did you find this?

56:41.640 --> 56:43.206
You once protected me
from the bullies

56:43.342 --> 56:45.308
in your world, Freddy Freeman.

56:45.443 --> 56:46.840
Now I've protected you
in mine.

56:51.744 --> 56:53.882
-Hero.
-[both chuckle]

56:54.018 --> 56:57.013
Well, to be fair, I didn't
actually need your protection.

56:57.149 --> 56:58.751
I was about to rearrange
those boys'

56:58.887 --> 57:00.283
internal organs
when you stepped in.

57:00.418 --> 57:02.988
But you didn't know that,
which does make you brave.

57:03.123 --> 57:05.926
I was just brave because
I knew I had powers.

57:06.061 --> 57:09.962
No, the most powerful thing
about you is you.

57:11.769 --> 57:14.198
[clears throat] How lovely
for both of you.

57:14.333 --> 57:16.706
Goddess, we thank you much,
but we must get--

57:16.841 --> 57:19.541
You should go. My sisters
don't need you anymore.

57:19.677 --> 57:21.479
All they require now
is the seed.

57:22.281 --> 57:24.042
-The seed?
-Yes.

57:24.177 --> 57:25.946
Which remains hidden
in a place unreachable

57:26.081 --> 57:27.981
by any of their kind.
Come, come, Jeff. Faster.

57:28.116 --> 57:30.582
You call me Jeff?
She just said my entire name!

57:30.718 --> 57:33.722
[whimsical music playing]

57:36.525 --> 57:38.727
[people chattering]

57:44.170 --> 57:46.031
[Shazam] Hi, God... No?

57:49.173 --> 57:51.234
Yo, Low Voltage.

57:52.908 --> 57:54.675
When you fixing
this dome shit, man?

57:54.810 --> 57:56.279
Oh, no, no, no,
don't worry, sir.

57:56.415 --> 57:57.575
[clicks tongue] I have a plan.

57:57.710 --> 57:59.011
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

57:59.146 --> 58:00.777
'Cause look like all you got
is a sandwich.

58:00.912 --> 58:02.078
No, these sandwiches?

58:02.214 --> 58:03.452
No, these sandwiches
are important.

58:03.587 --> 58:04.885
They're, they're
for a meeting.

58:05.020 --> 58:08.559
Yeah, sure,
Colonel Cheesesteak. [scoffs]

58:09.060 --> 58:10.055
Colonel?

58:11.089 --> 58:12.959
Oh, boy, I really need a name.

58:14.563 --> 58:16.061
[dramatic chord plays]

58:16.927 --> 58:18.495
Quiet one, she is.

58:18.630 --> 58:21.368
I find it the most effective
way to slit an enemy's throat.

58:21.504 --> 58:23.039
[chuckles nervously]

58:23.174 --> 58:24.474
Is that...

58:24.610 --> 58:26.371
Oh, you're totally serious.
Okay.

58:26.506 --> 58:27.942
Uh...

58:28.077 --> 58:30.844
Right, so, look, here's
the thing, um, you're upset.

58:30.980 --> 58:32.715
A bunch of wizards came
and stole your powers,

58:32.851 --> 58:35.014
which totally sucks balls,
I totally get it.

58:35.150 --> 58:37.988
But, I kind of feel like
you're taking this all,

58:38.124 --> 58:41.020
like, really personally
and, like, I don't even
know you, lady, right?

58:41.155 --> 58:43.625
If thieves stormed your home
in the night

58:43.760 --> 58:45.762
and stole all your coin
and then fled,

58:45.897 --> 58:48.566
you would naturally
give chase, would you not?

58:49.701 --> 58:51.094
And say, in this pursuit
the thieves

58:51.230 --> 58:52.735
dropped the money
on the ground

58:52.870 --> 58:55.672
and your neighbor picked it up
and kept it.

58:56.607 --> 58:59.168
Now, imagine it is not money,

58:59.303 --> 59:01.609
but the lifeblood
of your father.

59:01.744 --> 59:03.675
The last breath
of your mother.

59:03.811 --> 59:06.013
The power of all the gods,

59:06.148 --> 59:09.245
the magic of the entire realm
that was stolen.

59:09.381 --> 59:12.189
And now this magic courses
through you,

59:12.324 --> 59:13.886
and you have the gall

59:14.021 --> 59:16.825
to believe
that you deserve it?

59:18.594 --> 59:21.225
This is very personal,

59:22.430 --> 59:23.634
Billy.

59:26.338 --> 59:28.101
You are very menacing.

59:28.236 --> 59:30.337
I just want you to know that.
Like, I really...

59:30.472 --> 59:34.107
I see the presence
that you have,
and that goes a long way.

59:34.242 --> 59:37.776
But today, I really wanted
to talk about compromise.

59:37.912 --> 59:39.747
[both] There is no compromise.

59:39.883 --> 59:41.751
I knew you were gonna
say that.

59:41.887 --> 59:44.049
Wisdom of Saruman.
Don't mess with me, okay?

59:44.185 --> 59:46.720
Give us back Freddy,
you take down this

59:46.856 --> 59:49.918
sphere-y dome-y
magic bowl thing

59:50.054 --> 59:51.454
and then, you know,

59:51.589 --> 59:53.156
we won't have to annihilate
you into the ground.

59:53.291 --> 59:54.593
-[scoffs]
-It's a good offer.

59:54.728 --> 59:55.761
I'm being serious.

59:55.896 --> 59:58.500
You play the part of a man,

59:58.635 --> 1:00:00.864
but you do not play it well.

1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:03.641
Give us the powers, child.

1:00:04.242 --> 1:00:05.704
All of them.

1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:07.876
You are no leader, Billy.

1:00:08.676 --> 1:00:10.308
You are a lost boy

1:00:10.443 --> 1:00:13.543
who likes to make-believe
that he's a warrior.

1:00:13.679 --> 1:00:15.950
Okay, look. I might not have
as much experience as you

1:00:16.085 --> 1:00:17.780
'cause I'm not, like,
super old like you,

1:00:17.915 --> 1:00:21.016
but I think I have
a few experiences
that you don't have.

1:00:21.152 --> 1:00:24.691
'Cause I've seen all of the
<i> Fast and the Furious</i> movies,
lady.

1:00:24.827 --> 1:00:26.428
And let me tell you something.

1:00:26.563 --> 1:00:29.528
It's all about family!

1:00:29.664 --> 1:00:31.401
[music swells]

-[music stops]
-[birds cawing]

1:00:35.173 --> 1:00:36.867
Family!

1:00:37.003 --> 1:00:40.206
Guys, that was the signal.
We practiced this,
like, 12 times. Thank you.

1:00:40.341 --> 1:00:42.779
Forgot all about my family,
didn't you, Goddess?

1:00:43.782 --> 1:00:46.948
No, human.
You forgot about mine.

1:00:48.485 --> 1:00:49.681
[screams, grunts]

1:00:49.817 --> 1:00:52.151

1:00:58.430 --> 1:00:59.455
-Let's go.
-Pedro!

You're wasting my time, boy.

1:02:16.538 --> 1:02:17.735
Yeah.

1:02:17.871 --> 1:02:19.005
[Shazam] Whoo!

1:02:19.141 --> 1:02:20.604
She sure didn't see
that coming

1:02:20.739 --> 1:02:24.507
because she didn't go
to the eye doctor. [chuckles]

1:02:24.642 --> 1:02:26.379
[Shazam] Uh, Darla,
that was, 'cause...

1:02:26.515 --> 1:02:29.281
-[rattling]
-A euphemism.
That was a euphemism.

1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:38.191
-[Shazam] No!
-[women grunting]

1:02:49.605 --> 1:02:50.807
[Shazam groans]

1:02:50.942 --> 1:02:52.067
[Hespera] We've taken the power
from two

1:02:52.203 --> 1:02:53.976
in your family already.

1:02:54.111 --> 1:02:56.646
And now two more must die,
and for what?

1:02:56.782 --> 1:02:59.074
So you can keep
playing soldier?

1:02:59.209 --> 1:03:01.412

1:03:26.642 --> 1:03:28.846
[grunting]

1:03:35.587 --> 1:03:37.787
My father was Atlas.

1:03:37.923 --> 1:03:41.023
Titan god of stamina
and strength.

1:03:43.226 --> 1:03:46.092
His magic and power
may course through you,

1:03:46.228 --> 1:03:49.392
but you will never
be a true god.

1:03:49.528 --> 1:03:51.935
Oh, yeah? Did your dad
have superspeed?

1:03:52.866 --> 1:03:54.168

-Nope!

1:04:01.744 --> 1:04:03.373
[both panting]

1:04:03.508 --> 1:04:06.917
You okay? That was fun.
Let's go.

1:04:11.019 --> 1:04:12.890
Come on. Come on, come on.

1:04:15.254 --> 1:04:16.789
[Shazam] Hurry, everyone!

1:04:16.925 --> 1:04:18.126
Let's go, let's go.

-[door closes]
-[chain locks]

1:04:31.404 --> 1:04:32.668
You thought you were
just goin'

1:04:32.803 --> 1:04:34.206
into some regular porta-potty,
didn't ya?

1:04:34.342 --> 1:04:36.410
Which I can somehow
still smell.

1:04:36.546 --> 1:04:38.746
Yeah, yeah, it really sticks
around. It's crazy, right?

1:04:38.882 --> 1:04:39.947
-Yeah.
-Like, permeates

1:04:40.083 --> 1:04:41.411
the air.
Doesn't matter. Anyway,

1:04:41.547 --> 1:04:43.283
welcome to the Rock
of Eternity.

1:04:43.951 --> 1:04:45.252
Only Champions

1:04:45.387 --> 1:04:47.586
can get in here,
through any door that we want.

1:04:47.721 --> 1:04:50.420
Little thing that we can do
that your sisters can't.

1:04:50.556 --> 1:04:53.392
Guys, that's what I call
a total success.

1:04:54.561 --> 1:04:56.428
Okay, maybe, like,
a partial total win.

1:04:56.563 --> 1:04:58.360
-Told you I suck at dodgeball.
-[Shazam] Yeah,

1:04:58.495 --> 1:04:59.968
you do, yeah, but you know,

1:05:00.104 --> 1:05:01.263
look, Pedro, we all have
our weak spots.

1:05:01.398 --> 1:05:02.770
You know what I mean?

1:05:02.905 --> 1:05:04.333
And hers... [chuckles]

1:05:04.468 --> 1:05:06.036
lack of strategic thinking.

1:05:06.172 --> 1:05:08.011
Now for the real trade.

1:05:08.146 --> 1:05:11.344
Freddy and the staff,
for your freedom.

1:05:11.479 --> 1:05:12.911
[superhero Darla] And get rid
of the dome.

1:05:13.046 --> 1:05:14.044
[Shazam] Oh, yeah.

1:05:14.180 --> 1:05:16.215
And get rid of the dome.

1:05:16.350 --> 1:05:17.917
'Cause the city
of brotherly love

1:05:18.053 --> 1:05:19.418
is gettin' a little moist.

1:05:21.758 --> 1:05:23.026
Word choice, man.

1:05:23.161 --> 1:05:24.122
[Shazam] Yeah, I regretted it
as soon as

1:05:24.258 --> 1:05:25.723
it was coming out of my mouth.

1:05:25.858 --> 1:05:26.959
[Super Hero Eugene] It's just
one of those words...

1:05:27.095 --> 1:05:27.657
[Shazam] I know. I just...

1:05:32.233 --> 1:05:34.835
"Dear daughters
of Asshat-Las."

1:05:34.970 --> 1:05:36.639
-Burn!
-[chuckles]

1:05:36.775 --> 1:05:38.007
I just came up with that.

1:05:38.143 --> 1:05:39.104
Make sure you put a dash
in there, though,

1:05:39.239 --> 1:05:40.871
so it's really clear. Okay.

1:05:41.007 --> 1:05:43.413
[clears throat]
Man, it's so good having
Steve cover grammar

1:05:43.548 --> 1:05:46.148
and spelling and stuff,
it makes me sound
so much smarter.

1:05:46.916 --> 1:05:48.718
[clears throat] So...

1:05:48.854 --> 1:05:50.750
"A brother for a sister, huh?

1:05:50.885 --> 1:05:52.318
How's that feel?

1:05:52.453 --> 1:05:55.224
Also, how are you
actually sisters,

1:05:55.359 --> 1:05:58.061
because the age difference
is very noticeable,

1:05:58.196 --> 1:06:01.294
and slightly upsetting,
I'm not gonna lie."

1:06:01.430 --> 1:06:03.627
Even though I don't like you
very much,

1:06:03.762 --> 1:06:05.594
I believe everyone
deserves human rights,

1:06:05.730 --> 1:06:07.429
but you don't deserve
strawberry.

1:06:07.564 --> 1:06:10.667
You only get yellow. [gasps]

1:06:12.973 --> 1:06:14.176
She's gone!

1:06:15.745 --> 1:06:16.711
Wait, what?

1:06:16.847 --> 1:06:19.049
[dramatic music playing]

1:06:27.522 --> 1:06:29.285
I thought we brought her in
too easily.

1:06:29.421 --> 1:06:31.356
She wanted to get caught.

1:06:31.492 --> 1:06:34.926
I don't get it.
Where would she even go?

1:06:35.061 --> 1:06:36.264
[clanking]

1:06:37.999 --> 1:06:39.201
[door creaks]

1:06:44.173 --> 1:06:46.703
Well, this seemed inevitable.

1:06:53.151 --> 1:06:55.677
Yep. We are so lost.
Thanks, bozo.

1:06:55.813 --> 1:06:59.016
We are not lost.
Who's the wizard here?

1:06:59.152 --> 1:07:00.553
I don't know.

1:07:00.688 --> 1:07:02.818
You don't have any spells,
no magical artifacts,

1:07:02.953 --> 1:07:05.359
you know nothing about magic,
you're just...

1:07:08.832 --> 1:07:09.832
You're the wizard.

1:07:09.968 --> 1:07:11.831
-Thank you.
-Whatever.

1:07:11.966 --> 1:07:15.138
Now let's see if that
girlfriend of yours
can be trusted.

1:07:18.876 --> 1:07:21.078
[tense music playing]

1:07:28.052 --> 1:07:29.251
-[door unlocks]
-[Freddy gasps]

1:07:30.153 --> 1:07:32.551
Get back, get back. Get back.

1:07:42.462 --> 1:07:44.662
[whispering in other language]

1:07:49.300 --> 1:07:50.503
[Hespera gasps]

1:08:00.377 --> 1:08:02.112
[in English] Okay,
I think the coast is clear.
Let's go home.

1:08:02.247 --> 1:08:03.448
One moment.

1:08:03.584 --> 1:08:05.781
Did you not see
what she was holding?

1:08:05.916 --> 1:08:07.789
It was an apple.
She wanted a snack.

1:08:07.925 --> 1:08:09.192
What's the big deal?

1:08:09.327 --> 1:08:12.355
The golden apple.
From the Tree of Life.

1:08:12.490 --> 1:08:14.057
From the Tree of Life.

1:08:14.192 --> 1:08:16.298
Oh, wait, hold up, didn't you
say that was somewhere safe?

1:08:18.497 --> 1:08:20.966
-Billy!
-Billy. Gosh.

1:08:21.101 --> 1:08:22.304
[wizard groans]

1:08:23.809 --> 1:08:24.801
Where are you going now?

1:08:29.539 --> 1:08:30.741
[inhales sharply]

1:08:31.980 --> 1:08:34.409
[exhales] Nope.

1:08:34.545 --> 1:08:35.746
She's not in there.

1:08:36.819 --> 1:08:37.746
Nope.

1:08:37.882 --> 1:08:39.487
No, no, no.
That's a hard pass.

1:08:39.622 --> 1:08:41.519
-That's a hard pass.
-[Super Hero Eugene] Yo, Billy,

1:08:41.655 --> 1:08:43.051
you don't gotta worry
about that one.

1:08:43.186 --> 1:08:44.720
It's just a labyrinth
that doesn't go anywhere.

1:08:44.856 --> 1:08:46.524
-[sniffs]
-Like an ancient Greek

1:08:46.659 --> 1:08:47.890
-labyrinth?
-[Shazam] Guys...

1:08:48.933 --> 1:08:50.826
[sniffs] porta-potty.

1:08:50.961 --> 1:08:52.928
-[sniffs]
-[Super Hero Eugene] Mmm.

1:09:02.141 --> 1:09:03.411
Hespera.

1:09:08.612 --> 1:09:10.913
It's over, sisters.

1:09:11.049 --> 1:09:13.883
Now we can plant the seed
and restore our realm.

1:09:15.357 --> 1:09:18.391
Or we plant it in their realm.

1:09:18.527 --> 1:09:21.931
But that would destroy
their world.

1:09:22.066 --> 1:09:24.231
Just as they destroyed ours.

1:09:24.366 --> 1:09:26.397
[Hespera] You can't be serious.

1:09:26.532 --> 1:09:28.302
-Yes.
-[Anthea] No.

1:09:28.438 --> 1:09:29.733
No, that's not
what we agreed to.

1:09:29.869 --> 1:09:31.536
[Kalypso] Anthea,
you simpering bore.

1:09:31.672 --> 1:09:33.237
[Hespera] She's right,
we've spent ages

1:09:33.373 --> 1:09:34.877
waiting for this moment.

1:09:35.013 --> 1:09:36.211
[Anthea] We have the seed.

1:09:36.346 --> 1:09:38.181
We have the staff
and its powers.

1:09:38.316 --> 1:09:39.544
[Hespera]
We are not squandering it

1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:41.448
for your personal
satisfaction.

1:09:41.584 --> 1:09:44.483
[whispering]
No, I should go, not you.

1:09:44.619 --> 1:09:46.314
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

1:09:46.450 --> 1:09:48.757
The kid with the crutch
doesn't exactly
sing "sneak thief."

1:09:48.893 --> 1:09:51.290
But here's the deal.
Your knees crack like crazy
when you walk.

1:09:51.426 --> 1:09:52.759
-It's pathetic.
-[knees crack]

1:09:52.895 --> 1:09:53.956
See?

1:09:55.033 --> 1:09:56.265
Fortune be with you, Freddy.

1:09:56.400 --> 1:09:58.697
Thank you.
What did you just call me?

1:09:59.432 --> 1:10:01.863
Freddy. Freddy Freeman.

1:10:01.999 --> 1:10:05.438
[chuckles] That's it.
You nailed it.

1:10:05.573 --> 1:10:07.442
I'll see you
on the other side.

1:10:08.677 --> 1:10:10.079
[Hespera] Even if we did,
the Tree of Life

1:10:10.214 --> 1:10:11.712
would not thrive
in their soil.

1:10:11.848 --> 1:10:15.015
It would despoil, it would
disfigure into something...

1:10:15.151 --> 1:10:16.346
[Kalypso] Monstrous?

1:10:16.482 --> 1:10:18.722
That is what humans are.

1:10:18.857 --> 1:10:21.718
It is only fitting
that we bring
our monsters to their world

1:10:21.854 --> 1:10:24.657
and do to them
as they did to us.

1:10:27.530 --> 1:10:29.391
[Anthea] We agreed
to restore balance

1:10:29.526 --> 1:10:33.029
and vengeance has
great measure of weight
on those scales.

1:10:33.164 --> 1:10:36.302
Anthea, humans are villains,
even to themselves.

1:10:36.437 --> 1:10:38.236
-No, not all.
-All.

1:10:38.372 --> 1:10:41.909
[Hespera] Sister,
I fear your rage
has gotten the better of you.

1:10:42.045 --> 1:10:43.146
[Kalypso] Why?

1:10:43.281 --> 1:10:45.446
Humans wreak havoc
and devastation,

1:10:45.582 --> 1:10:47.613
then pray to the gods
to absolve them.

1:10:47.749 --> 1:10:49.913
They actually pray
for order and peace

1:10:50.048 --> 1:10:53.288
when all they do
is dismantle it at every turn.

1:10:53.424 --> 1:10:55.519
Anthea, I want you
to take the apple

1:10:55.654 --> 1:10:57.954
and plant it in our garden.

1:10:59.089 --> 1:11:00.526
[Kalypso] Of course
you turn to her.

1:11:00.662 --> 1:11:02.330
Father would be ashamed
of both of you.

1:11:02.465 --> 1:11:04.165
-[object clatters]
-[Freddy yelps]

1:11:04.301 --> 1:11:06.369
Where did that even come from?

1:11:07.667 --> 1:11:09.500
-Hi!
-You favor her, Hespera,

1:11:09.635 --> 1:11:11.539
and see how she betrays us.

1:11:14.908 --> 1:11:16.409
Deliver him
to his proper fate, sister.

1:11:16.544 --> 1:11:18.876
-No!
-[Kalypso] Kill him!

1:11:22.316 --> 1:11:23.746
What is that?

1:11:23.881 --> 1:11:25.949
[Shazam] Great question.
No idea.

1:11:26.991 --> 1:11:28.385
But made you look.

1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:29.887
Billy! [chuckles]

1:11:31.490 --> 1:11:33.228
-Oh!
-Oh.

1:11:33.363 --> 1:11:34.857
-[Freddy gasps]
-Your crutch!

1:11:34.993 --> 1:11:38.065
-Oh! Shazam!
-[lightning cracks]

1:11:38.200 --> 1:11:39.402
-Yes!
-No!

1:11:43.275 --> 1:11:45.375
So, we have a lot
to talk about.

1:11:55.285 --> 1:11:57.684
Kalypso, hand me the staff.

1:11:59.388 --> 1:12:00.989
You are not fit to wield it.

1:12:01.124 --> 1:12:02.358
More fit than you.

1:12:02.494 --> 1:12:03.888
You had him in your hands,
yet did nothing.

1:12:04.023 --> 1:12:07.428
Our sole purpose is
to avenge our father,

1:12:07.564 --> 1:12:09.828
but everyone here
has become weak.

1:12:10.695 --> 1:12:13.062
Ladon, world-eater,

1:12:13.763 --> 1:12:16.267
rise from the pit!

1:12:16.402 --> 1:12:18.606
[clanking]

1:12:20.671 --> 1:12:22.841
[Ladon roars]

1:12:25.149 --> 1:12:26.816
[Shazam] Go, go, go!

1:12:26.951 --> 1:12:28.151
[superhero Darla]
Captain Everypower!
Where's he going?

1:12:28.286 --> 1:12:29.484
[Super Hero Eugene] What the...

1:12:29.619 --> 1:12:31.520
-[superhero Mary screams]
-[Ladon roars]

1:12:33.353 --> 1:12:35.392

1:12:37.829 --> 1:12:38.927
[roars]

1:12:39.062 --> 1:12:41.626
[snoring]

1:12:41.762 --> 1:12:43.961
[superheroes chattering
faintly]

1:12:45.201 --> 1:12:46.403
[Rosa] Victor?

1:12:47.037 --> 1:12:48.236
Victor, wake up.

1:12:48.371 --> 1:12:51.468
Hello. Oh, God, woman. What?

1:12:51.603 --> 1:12:53.004
Dad. We gotta go!

1:12:53.139 --> 1:12:55.105
-We gotta get out of here.
-We have to go right now!

1:12:55.241 --> 1:12:57.338
This is funny, right?
I know what this looks like.

1:12:57.474 --> 1:12:59.345
That's not true. I have
no idea what this looks like.

1:12:59.480 --> 1:13:01.150
Just don't freak out.

1:13:01.285 --> 1:13:02.546
[Victor and Rosa screaming]

1:13:02.681 --> 1:13:04.883
[all speaking at once]

1:13:06.151 --> 1:13:07.720
I said don't freak out!
Look at me, it's Billy.

1:13:07.856 --> 1:13:09.490
Rosa, it's Billy, okay?
And that's Eugene,

1:13:09.626 --> 1:13:10.788
-and that's Freddy...
-It's me.

1:13:10.924 --> 1:13:12.020
That's Darla
and that's Mary, obvi,

1:13:12.155 --> 1:13:13.863
and then Pedro,
just normal Pedro.

1:13:13.998 --> 1:13:15.663
[Shazam panting]

1:13:15.798 --> 1:13:16.825
Guys, this is no time
for secrets, okay?

1:13:16.961 --> 1:13:19.061
We have to tell 'em the truth.

1:13:19.196 --> 1:13:21.630
-[all] We're superheroes.
-I'm gay.

1:13:21.766 --> 1:13:23.000
Yeah, we know, bud.

1:13:24.176 --> 1:13:25.673
-You knew?
-Yeah.

1:13:26.539 --> 1:13:28.608
-Yeah.
-Oh.

1:13:28.744 --> 1:13:30.513
-I'm the wizard.
-Oh, this is the wizard.

1:13:30.648 --> 1:13:32.010
He's a wizard who's called
"the wizard."

1:13:32.145 --> 1:13:33.813
Okay, get dressed right now.
Come on, hurry up.

1:13:33.948 --> 1:13:35.083
[superhero Darla]
Put on these clothes.

1:13:35.218 --> 1:13:36.546
This is so weird.

1:13:36.681 --> 1:13:37.815
[Shazam] Yep, yep.

1:13:37.951 --> 1:13:40.318
You guys are
the Philly Fiascoes?

1:13:40.454 --> 1:13:43.826
Okay. This is in no way
an acknowledgement
of that stupid nickname

1:13:43.961 --> 1:13:45.889
but, yes, that would be us.
Now can you pick up the pace?

1:13:46.024 --> 1:13:48.223
We have to go.
The dragon is here!

1:13:49.032 --> 1:13:50.464
Dragon?

1:13:50.599 --> 1:13:52.799

-[Super Hero Eugene] You okay?
-[breathing heavily]

1:14:29.072 --> 1:14:30.067
Okay.

1:14:31.070 --> 1:14:32.672
I know this is a lot
to take in,

1:14:32.808 --> 1:14:34.671
but I promise
to explain it all later.

1:14:34.806 --> 1:14:36.339
[Victor] Explain what?

1:14:36.475 --> 1:14:38.209
That our kids are superheroes
being hunted by Greek gods

1:14:38.345 --> 1:14:39.844
that used a dragon to destroy
the house we just bought?

1:14:39.980 --> 1:14:42.247
-Yeah.
-Wait, you bought the house?

1:14:42.382 --> 1:14:43.618
Yeah.

[Pedro] Get down.

1:15:05.675 --> 1:15:07.236
[superhero Freddy]
Okay, that's it!

1:15:08.313 --> 1:15:11.875

Hey, hey!
This is what you want, right?

1:15:25.229 --> 1:15:26.827
[Ladon growls]

1:15:33.865 --> 1:15:35.165
Come on, we're good.

1:15:35.300 --> 1:15:36.633
We're safe right now.
Let's go. Let's go.

You okay?

1:16:51.215 --> 1:16:52.209
All right.

[tires screeching]

1:20:32.997 --> 1:20:34.931
Holy moly.

1:20:35.066 --> 1:20:37.902

[foreboding music playing]

1:20:49.217 --> 1:20:51.283
[creatures roaring,
screeching]

1:20:54.655 --> 1:20:57.191
You know, I never thought
I'd say this about a dragon,

1:20:57.326 --> 1:21:00.160
but it is the least
of our problems right now.

1:21:03.297 --> 1:21:04.698
Your world will not
survive this.

1:21:04.833 --> 1:21:05.929
Yeah, no shit, Merlin!

1:21:06.065 --> 1:21:07.299
[Anthea] He's right.

1:21:08.438 --> 1:21:09.632
Anne!

1:21:09.767 --> 1:21:12.568
-Are you okay? Are you hurt?
-I'm okay, I'm fine.

1:21:13.778 --> 1:21:15.406
In the God Realm, this tree...

1:21:16.273 --> 1:21:18.578
is a thing of beauty.

1:21:18.713 --> 1:21:20.179
Of peace.

1:21:20.315 --> 1:21:22.580
It was not meant
for the soil of this realm

1:21:22.716 --> 1:21:24.954
and it's become monstrous
by the hand that planted it.

1:21:25.089 --> 1:21:27.051
Whose side is she on, anyway?
Do you...

1:21:27.186 --> 1:21:29.187
I must try to sway Hespera.

1:21:29.323 --> 1:21:31.223
Only she can subdue
our sister.

1:21:31.358 --> 1:21:33.495
I will give it my all,
or die trying.

1:21:33.631 --> 1:21:34.931
Die? No, I'm pretty sure

1:21:35.066 --> 1:21:36.360
we can come up
with an alternative to dying.

1:21:36.496 --> 1:21:39.028
My sweet Freddy,
I'm ready if need be.

1:21:39.164 --> 1:21:40.564
I've lived a long life.

1:21:40.699 --> 1:21:42.269
What are you talking about,
"Lived a long life?"

1:21:42.404 --> 1:21:43.297
We're the same age.
You're young. We're young.

1:21:43.433 --> 1:21:45.167
I'm over 6,000 years old.

1:21:45.303 --> 1:21:47.075
-Oh?
-[chuckles]

1:21:48.479 --> 1:21:49.473
You look great.

1:21:49.941 --> 1:21:51.145
Oh.

1:21:56.183 --> 1:21:57.880
Suddenly seems inappropriate.

1:21:58.015 --> 1:21:59.219
Yeah.

1:22:06.790 --> 1:22:09.193
We can't let her die.
She called me sweet!

1:22:09.329 --> 1:22:11.198
We have to figure
something out.

1:22:12.197 --> 1:22:13.197
Take my powers back.

1:22:13.332 --> 1:22:14.735
-No, Billy!
-No, no, no.

1:22:14.871 --> 1:22:16.337
Hey, take my powers back.

1:22:16.472 --> 1:22:17.598
You gave 'em to me, so you can
take 'em back, right?

1:22:17.734 --> 1:22:19.941
I am no longer the champion.
You are!

1:22:20.077 --> 1:22:21.104
You think I know
how to fix this, dude,

1:22:21.240 --> 1:22:22.706
but I really don't, okay?

1:22:22.841 --> 1:22:25.180
I, I didn't even know
who those Greek sisters were.

1:22:25.315 --> 1:22:26.882
I had to Google them.
But you know who they are,

1:22:27.018 --> 1:22:28.616
which means you know
what to do.

1:22:28.752 --> 1:22:30.446
And you were right.

1:22:30.581 --> 1:22:32.650
You picked
the wrong champion, man.

1:22:32.786 --> 1:22:34.550
I mean, that's why I always
say "all or none," right?

1:22:34.686 --> 1:22:37.224
Because without my family,
I'm nothing.

1:22:40.164 --> 1:22:42.497
And honestly, I have no idea
what I'm doin'.

1:22:42.632 --> 1:22:43.491
[wizard] No.

1:22:43.627 --> 1:22:45.094
You don't have
a shred of wisdom

1:22:45.230 --> 1:22:47.036
in that brain of yours.

1:22:48.035 --> 1:22:50.368
But your heart is wise.

1:22:50.504 --> 1:22:53.769
And it knows exactly
what must be done.

1:22:53.905 --> 1:22:57.772
I spent millennia searching
for a worthy champion

1:22:59.382 --> 1:23:01.211
and no one was worthy
of what I once shared

1:23:01.347 --> 1:23:03.644
with my brothers and sisters.

1:23:03.780 --> 1:23:05.780
But when you shared
your powers,

1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:08.352
you did not hesitate.

1:23:08.488 --> 1:23:10.856
For you, everyone
can be worthy

1:23:10.991 --> 1:23:12.321
if given a chance.

1:23:12.457 --> 1:23:15.861
Now, go fight for your family.

1:23:15.997 --> 1:23:18.065
Go fight for the world.

1:23:18.201 --> 1:23:20.597
I chose right
when I chose you.

1:23:24.234 --> 1:23:25.369
[Freddy] Billy?

1:23:25.505 --> 1:23:27.101
Billy, what are we gonna do,
man?

1:23:27.237 --> 1:23:30.307
Same thing we
always do, Freddy.
Save the God darn world.

1:23:30.443 --> 1:23:32.114
Now, I'm gonna go
get that staff

1:23:32.249 --> 1:23:33.811
and I need you to lure
these things away

1:23:33.946 --> 1:23:36.611
from the stadium while I deal
with the dragon, all right?

1:23:36.747 --> 1:23:38.481
Wait, wait, wait,
Billy, Billy.

1:23:38.616 --> 1:23:40.886
Can I just see you,
before you go?

1:23:41.021 --> 1:23:42.920
Not this version.

1:23:43.055 --> 1:23:44.856
You... You.

1:23:44.991 --> 1:23:46.293
My Billy.

1:23:47.127 --> 1:23:49.329
[gentle music playing]

1:23:52.162 --> 1:23:53.162
Shazam!

1:23:53.297 --> 1:23:55.029
[lightning cracks]

1:23:55.165 --> 1:23:58.173
Is that why the house keeps
getting struck by lightning?

1:24:01.479 --> 1:24:02.474
Hey.

1:24:09.380 --> 1:24:11.217
I promise after this

1:24:11.353 --> 1:24:13.386
if I don't get eaten
by a dragon,

1:24:14.653 --> 1:24:16.350
I'm not gonna force you
to keep me.

1:24:16.486 --> 1:24:18.793
-Okay?
-What?

1:24:18.928 --> 1:24:20.723
I know I age out soon.

1:24:21.928 --> 1:24:23.361
Billy.

1:24:23.497 --> 1:24:27.729
My wonderful, kind,
brave, son.

1:24:27.864 --> 1:24:29.567
You will never age out
of your home.

1:24:31.300 --> 1:24:32.603
Never.

1:24:36.945 --> 1:24:38.774
Now, do me a favor

1:24:38.909 --> 1:24:41.342
and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart,

1:24:41.478 --> 1:24:44.252
go kick their ass, okay?

1:24:45.282 --> 1:24:46.518
I love you, Mom.

1:24:48.020 --> 1:24:49.224
Me too.

1:24:50.754 --> 1:24:53.129

1:24:57.928 --> 1:25:00.363
That's gonna take
some getting used to.

1:25:00.499 --> 1:25:02.264
Everybody to the battle wagon!

1:25:02.399 --> 1:25:03.832
The battle wagon?

1:25:05.034 --> 1:25:06.802

into the spirit of things.

Don't you see what
you're doing to these people?

1:25:26.961 --> 1:25:28.164
[Kalypso] I do.

1:25:28.965 --> 1:25:30.426
And what I see is just.

1:25:30.561 --> 1:25:31.759
Hespera, look at this tree.

1:25:31.895 --> 1:25:34.499
It is blighted.
It is unnatural here.

1:25:34.634 --> 1:25:36.430
We made a vow
to restore our realm,

1:25:36.566 --> 1:25:37.999
not destroy another.

1:25:38.135 --> 1:25:40.073
[Kalypso] A god has answered
their prayers at last.

1:25:40.209 --> 1:25:42.339
They did not know their place,

1:25:42.474 --> 1:25:43.806
so I am showing it to them.

1:25:43.941 --> 1:25:47.510
Your fanatical tone
echoes our uncle Hades.

1:25:47.645 --> 1:25:49.781

to this.

Hespera.

1:26:09.671 --> 1:26:13.405
If your emotions rest
with the humans so, Anne,

1:26:13.540 --> 1:26:16.212
then perhaps you should
be human.

Okay, now what? There are only
so many minotaurs

1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:32.321
I can run over with this van.

1:27:32.822 --> 1:27:33.817

1:27:36.827 --> 1:27:37.821
Hey, Steve.

1:27:39.393 --> 1:27:40.989
What are monsters afraid of?

1:27:44.595 --> 1:27:45.865
"The king of beasts."

1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:46.999
Lions?

1:27:47.134 --> 1:27:48.133
Unicorns.

1:27:48.269 --> 1:27:50.205
Really? I love unicorns.

1:27:50.340 --> 1:27:52.238
Yet, the unicorn
does not love you.

1:27:52.373 --> 1:27:54.273
Guys, unicorns don't exist.

-Ah! [pants]

1:28:00.846 --> 1:28:02.651
I guess maybe
it's not so crazy.

1:28:02.787 --> 1:28:05.887
The unicorn is the most
fearsome creature
of its realm.

1:28:06.023 --> 1:28:07.114
Ruthless and cruel,

1:28:07.249 --> 1:28:08.550
not like the ponies
from your storybooks.

1:28:08.685 --> 1:28:10.192
They loathe humanity.

1:28:10.328 --> 1:28:11.987
Is there anything
they do like?

1:28:13.361 --> 1:28:15.397
"Dark caverns. Ambrosia"?

1:28:15.532 --> 1:28:16.859
Ambrosia. It's like the nectar
of the gods.

1:28:16.995 --> 1:28:18.866
It's supposed to be sweet,
like honey.

1:28:19.001 --> 1:28:20.100
I have an idea.

1:28:20.235 --> 1:28:21.735
Go, go! Quick, quick.

1:28:21.871 --> 1:28:24.769

But, no.

Yeah, yeah, yeah,

This all came
from the tree, right?

1:35:08.810 --> 1:35:10.172
I might know a way to destroy

1:35:10.308 --> 1:35:11.745

all in one.

are too great, boy.

-with enough lightning.
-A bomb?

1:35:20.416 --> 1:35:21.684
Is that enough
to kill the dragon?

1:35:21.819 --> 1:35:23.055
And more.

1:35:24.758 --> 1:35:26.089
You would annihilate

everything that's inside
the dome.

What is a god
without her power?

The most powerful thing
about you

1:37:39.560 --> 1:37:40.659
is you.

1:38:11.524 --> 1:38:14.259
That must be super
disappointing as a dragon.

Assuming that you are one.

1:38:18.200 --> 1:38:19.628
I mean, you fly,
and you breathe fire,

1:38:19.764 --> 1:38:21.762
but you're also made of wood
which is a weird flex

1:38:21.897 --> 1:38:24.500
and a serious design flaw,
if I'm being honest.

You're not supposed
to be in there.

1:41:57.951 --> 1:42:00.849
Yeah, I am.

1:42:00.985 --> 1:42:02.782
I used to think that
I couldn't do anything right,

1:42:02.918 --> 1:42:04.918
that I didn't deserve
my powers,

had a family. You know that.

about, they all left me.

1:42:31.588 --> 1:42:32.649
No.

1:48:28.978 --> 1:48:29.973
Billy?

1:48:30.474 --> 1:48:31.645
Billy?

1:48:32.774 --> 1:48:33.977
[Freddy] Billy!

1:48:35.677 --> 1:48:36.914
Billy!

1:48:38.079 --> 1:48:40.581
Billy. Where are you? [sobs]

1:48:40.716 --> 1:48:41.985
[Victor] Billy!

1:48:43.752 --> 1:48:44.955
[Freddy] Billy?

1:48:48.725 --> 1:48:51.027
Billy! Billy.

1:48:53.497 --> 1:48:54.528
Billy!

1:48:54.663 --> 1:48:55.867
Billy!

1:48:56.698 --> 1:48:57.798
Billy!

1:48:57.934 --> 1:48:59.574
Dude, wake up. You did it.

1:49:01.974 --> 1:49:03.708
Okay. You're supposed
to wake up.

1:49:03.844 --> 1:49:04.773
It's the part
where you wake up

1:49:04.908 --> 1:49:06.440
and open your eyes and laugh

1:49:06.576 --> 1:49:10.046
and you're supposed to say
you got me, 'cause you got me.

1:49:11.353 --> 1:49:12.950
Dude. Joke's over, man.

1:49:13.550 --> 1:49:14.820
Billy!

1:49:16.787 --> 1:49:19.088
Billy. Billy, come on.

1:49:21.492 --> 1:49:22.655
Freddy.

1:49:22.790 --> 1:49:23.994
[sobs]

1:49:26.135 --> 1:49:27.602
What did you do?

1:49:29.633 --> 1:49:30.635
Wake up, Billy.

1:49:30.770 --> 1:49:32.772
-[Victor] Billy?
-He's over here!

1:49:35.638 --> 1:49:36.842
Billy.

1:49:38.281 --> 1:49:40.615
[sobs] You asshole!

1:49:41.747 --> 1:49:44.113
We're a team! We're a team!

1:49:45.253 --> 1:49:46.247
Oh, Billy.

1:49:47.518 --> 1:49:48.748
Billy.

1:49:48.883 --> 1:49:50.917
Oh, my baby. No.

1:49:51.052 --> 1:49:53.254
[solemn music playing]

1:49:55.694 --> 1:49:57.357
[Anthea] He was a hero.

1:49:58.862 --> 1:50:01.130
He was a hero and a god.

1:50:01.265 --> 1:50:03.770
And he should be laid
to rest like one.

1:50:08.144 --> 1:50:09.307
Hey, pal.

1:50:09.442 --> 1:50:11.375
[Freddy crying]

1:50:11.510 --> 1:50:12.944
[Rosa sobs]

1:50:28.562 --> 1:50:30.731
[gentle music playing]

1:51:17.580 --> 1:51:19.340
Will this land ever come back?

1:51:20.242 --> 1:51:22.882
The staff is drained of magic.

1:51:23.017 --> 1:51:26.116
Only the spark of a god
can restore its power

1:51:26.984 --> 1:51:28.756
and there are no gods left.

1:51:29.986 --> 1:51:31.451
[woman] There is one.

1:51:33.124 --> 1:51:36.159
[ancient lamentation music
playing]

1:51:41.096 --> 1:51:42.836
[dramatic music playing]

1:51:46.804 --> 1:51:48.842
[gasps, chuckles]

1:51:50.179 --> 1:51:51.174
What?

1:52:04.920 --> 1:52:06.054
[crackles]

1:52:06.190 --> 1:52:08.389
-[grunts]
-[magic resonates]

1:52:09.595 --> 1:52:11.463
[panting]

1:52:11.599 --> 1:52:13.801
[pleasant music playing]

1:52:18.340 --> 1:52:20.803
[Darla chuckles]

1:52:20.938 --> 1:52:22.436
[Mary and Pedro gasp]

1:52:28.042 --> 1:52:29.542
[chuckles] Whoa.

1:52:48.668 --> 1:52:49.600
[Freddy] Whoa.

1:52:49.736 --> 1:52:51.938
[powers resonating]

1:52:53.167 --> 1:52:54.369
[Anthea chuckles]

1:53:14.593 --> 1:53:15.588
[chirps]

1:53:16.932 --> 1:53:18.595
-[dramatic chord plays]
-[all scream]

1:53:18.731 --> 1:53:19.933
It's a zombie!

1:53:21.163 --> 1:53:23.233
[Shazam grunts] Guys!

1:53:23.934 --> 1:53:25.338
What the hell?

1:53:25.474 --> 1:53:27.101
You buried me?

1:53:27.236 --> 1:53:29.672
In what, like, two minutes?

1:53:29.807 --> 1:53:30.739
Oh, Billy!

1:53:30.875 --> 1:53:32.475
[all whooping]

1:53:32.611 --> 1:53:33.646
Hey.

1:53:33.781 --> 1:53:36.213
Oh, man. I missed you guys.

1:53:38.947 --> 1:53:40.613
Hi. Hey.

1:53:41.522 --> 1:53:43.215
Oh, my God. Hi.

1:53:43.351 --> 1:53:44.989
Why didn't anybody tell...

1:53:45.124 --> 1:53:46.960
Hi. Sorry, sorry,
I didn't, uh...

1:53:47.095 --> 1:53:49.990
I didn't see you there,
I was, um, I was...

1:53:50.126 --> 1:53:51.426
I was dead at the time.

1:53:52.468 --> 1:53:53.560
So, you, uh...

1:53:54.537 --> 1:53:56.002
you got my bird letter?

1:53:56.999 --> 1:53:58.466
Oh, I, uh...

1:54:00.040 --> 1:54:01.502
I think you've got
something...

1:54:03.312 --> 1:54:04.443
On my...

1:54:04.578 --> 1:54:06.144
Where... Oh.

1:54:06.711 --> 1:54:07.948
What?

1:54:08.648 --> 1:54:09.616
That's a spider.

1:54:09.752 --> 1:54:11.117
I'm sorry, that's disgusting.

1:54:11.252 --> 1:54:13.650
Also, [chuckling]
that's really embarrassing.

1:54:13.785 --> 1:54:14.987
Yes, it is.

1:54:15.122 --> 1:54:17.457
But it was an amazing thing
you did.

1:54:17.593 --> 1:54:19.222
The sacrifice you made.

1:54:19.357 --> 1:54:22.223
You brought this world
back to life.

1:54:22.359 --> 1:54:24.598
Maybe this time,
gods and humans

1:54:24.733 --> 1:54:26.365
can learn to live in peace.

1:54:26.500 --> 1:54:27.495
Yeah.

1:54:28.837 --> 1:54:30.971
Use the power of Zeus wisely.

1:54:33.037 --> 1:54:34.568
Be well, Billy Batson.

1:54:36.607 --> 1:54:39.480
Hey, you know, just because
your father's power

1:54:39.615 --> 1:54:40.773
is surging through me,

1:54:40.908 --> 1:54:43.076
that doesn't technically
make us related, you know,

1:54:43.212 --> 1:54:44.512
and I'm gonna be 18

1:54:44.647 --> 1:54:46.346
in, like, five months, so...
[clicks tongue]

1:54:46.481 --> 1:54:48.582
Stick to saving
the world, kid.

1:54:48.718 --> 1:54:50.784
Yeah, you know, like,
that's... Okay, cool.

1:54:50.920 --> 1:54:52.287
See ya.

1:54:52.423 --> 1:54:54.120
What's with our boys
and older women?

1:54:54.255 --> 1:54:55.457
[exhales sharply]

1:54:57.333 --> 1:54:58.863
Hey.

1:54:58.998 --> 1:55:00.500
Who wants their powers back?

1:55:00.635 --> 1:55:01.628
[Shazam chuckles]

1:55:02.396 --> 1:55:04.265
We can do that, right?

1:55:04.400 --> 1:55:05.571
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay, good.

1:55:05.706 --> 1:55:06.807
Good, good, good.

1:55:06.942 --> 1:55:08.606
[Victor] I'd like
our house back.

1:55:08.741 --> 1:55:09.774
Can we do that?

1:55:09.909 --> 1:55:11.712
[upbeat music playing]

1:55:11.847 --> 1:55:13.410
-[Victor] Dinner!
-Coming.

1:55:13.545 --> 1:55:16.115
Aw. Thank you for respecting
the cross-stitch.

1:55:18.553 --> 1:55:19.547
[Rosa chuckles]

1:55:20.622 --> 1:55:21.888
[Rosa] Anthea.

1:55:22.024 --> 1:55:23.118
Have you decided what
you're gonna do

1:55:23.254 --> 1:55:25.688
about that god realm of yours?

1:55:25.824 --> 1:55:28.455
Well, actually I'm gonna take
some time off while it heals.

1:55:28.591 --> 1:55:30.664
Spend some time
with the common folk.

1:55:30.799 --> 1:55:32.198
Learn some about your world,

1:55:32.333 --> 1:55:34.766
about how, maybe,
we can learn from each other.

1:55:34.902 --> 1:55:36.331
Number one sign of wisdom:

1:55:36.467 --> 1:55:38.230
Admitting there's always
more to learn.

1:55:38.366 --> 1:55:39.703
I'm coming around to it.

1:55:39.838 --> 1:55:41.206
[doorbell rings]

1:55:41.807 --> 1:55:43.142
I got it.

1:55:47.449 --> 1:55:48.444
Whoa.

1:55:49.078 --> 1:55:50.545
Uh, guys?

1:55:51.145 --> 1:55:52.081
Guys!

1:55:52.216 --> 1:55:54.450
[suspenseful music playing]

1:55:59.726 --> 1:56:00.995
It's the wizard.

1:56:02.392 --> 1:56:04.226
-Oh, my God!
-[Rosa] No way!

1:56:04.361 --> 1:56:05.996
-Yes.
-Look at this guy!

1:56:06.132 --> 1:56:07.327
Look at him, he's so handsome.

1:56:07.463 --> 1:56:08.694
You pimpin' now, what is this?

1:56:08.830 --> 1:56:10.431
-[Billy] You look amazing.
-You look great!

1:56:10.567 --> 1:56:12.565
Well, I was
in the neighborhood

1:56:12.701 --> 1:56:14.306
and, um, I just wanted
to express

1:56:14.441 --> 1:56:16.639
-my gratitude before I go.
-[doorbell rings, pops]

1:56:16.775 --> 1:56:21.079
Sorry. Doorbell's broken.
Actually, everything's broken.

1:56:21.214 --> 1:56:23.017
-[Freddy chuckles]
-Not everything.

1:56:25.681 --> 1:56:27.317
You were just
in the neighborhood?

1:56:27.453 --> 1:56:29.649
[chuckles] Okay,
I came for the staff.

1:56:29.784 --> 1:56:31.685
Perhaps I will hold
onto it for now.

1:56:31.820 --> 1:56:35.863
I also wanted to see
your faces one last time

1:56:35.998 --> 1:56:37.697
before I turn into a pile
of ash.

1:56:37.833 --> 1:56:39.132
-Wait, what?
-No!

1:56:39.267 --> 1:56:41.197
I am making a joke.
I have an Uber waiting.

1:56:41.332 --> 1:56:42.930
-And besides...
-[chuckles]

1:56:43.066 --> 1:56:45.937
...I've been trapped in rocks
and prisons for far too long.

1:56:46.072 --> 1:56:47.937
It's time to see your world.

1:56:48.073 --> 1:56:49.470
It's been an honor,

1:56:49.606 --> 1:56:52.211
a privilege,
watching you all soar.

1:56:52.346 --> 1:56:53.711
You know, you're not such
a bad wizard.

1:56:53.846 --> 1:56:55.080
Thank you, Jeff.

1:56:55.216 --> 1:56:57.249
-[sighs] It never ends.
-[chuckles]

1:56:58.379 --> 1:56:59.581
[Billy] Also,

1:57:00.955 --> 1:57:02.584
what's my superhero name?

1:57:05.022 --> 1:57:07.490
Your name is...

1:57:08.530 --> 1:57:10.125
Shazam.

1:57:10.260 --> 1:57:11.190
-Of course.
-Yeah.

1:57:11.326 --> 1:57:13.562
[all agreeing]

1:57:15.102 --> 1:57:17.231
I still think we can beat it.

1:57:17.366 --> 1:57:19.568
[upbeat music playing]

1:59:56.595 --> 1:59:58.161
My feet hurt.
How much further?

1:59:58.296 --> 1:59:59.429
About ten seconds less

1:59:59.565 --> 2:00:00.860
than the last time
you asked me.

2:00:00.995 --> 2:00:02.531
I'm sorry, I just feel
like we could

2:00:02.667 --> 2:00:04.003
have parked
a little bit closer.

2:00:04.139 --> 2:00:05.270
He doesn't know we're coming,

2:00:05.406 --> 2:00:06.702
and I didn't want
to spook him.

2:00:06.837 --> 2:00:09.072
"Spook him."
He's a superhero, not a deer.

2:00:09.208 --> 2:00:10.475
All right, let's go.

2:00:10.610 --> 2:00:12.512
And then you can tell Waller
that even though

2:00:12.648 --> 2:00:14.914
she thinks this guy could be
a good addition to the team,

2:00:15.050 --> 2:00:16.348
we never actually met him

2:00:16.484 --> 2:00:18.714
because you wore
shitty walking shoes.

2:00:18.850 --> 2:00:20.648
[chuckles] Okay, first of all,
they're boots,

2:00:20.784 --> 2:00:22.723
and they're not shitty,
they're new.

2:00:22.858 --> 2:00:25.623
-I just haven't had a chance
to break them in yet.
-Shut up.

2:00:25.758 --> 2:00:28.895
Waller said this guy
is as powerful as they come,

2:00:29.030 --> 2:00:30.697
but a little immature.

2:00:30.832 --> 2:00:31.958
Oh, great.

2:00:32.867 --> 2:00:35.500
Whoo! [chuckles]

2:00:40.138 --> 2:00:42.342
[grunting]

2:00:44.244 --> 2:00:45.811
-Billy Batson.
-Yeah?

2:00:45.946 --> 2:00:47.412
I mean, no.

2:00:47.548 --> 2:00:48.941
I've never heard that name
in my life.

2:00:49.077 --> 2:00:50.480
I don't know who
you're talking about.

2:00:50.616 --> 2:00:51.945
But I'd like to meet
that person

2:00:52.080 --> 2:00:53.815
'cause they sound super cool.
And funny.

2:00:53.950 --> 2:00:56.715
And talented.
And ridiculously handsome,

2:00:56.851 --> 2:00:58.357
but, like, in a dangerous way.

2:00:58.492 --> 2:01:00.290
What the hell
are you talking about?

2:01:00.425 --> 2:01:02.425
Relax. We know who you are.

2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:04.892
-How?
-Don't worry about that.

2:01:05.934 --> 2:01:06.692
Who are you guys?

2:01:06.828 --> 2:01:08.167
Don't worry about that either.

2:01:08.302 --> 2:01:09.829
Look, we've seen
what you can do.

2:01:09.965 --> 2:01:11.597
And we're here
to make you an offer.

2:01:11.733 --> 2:01:12.697
How would you like to join

2:01:12.833 --> 2:01:14.072
-the Justice...
-Yes!

2:01:14.207 --> 2:01:15.507
A thousand times yes!

2:01:15.642 --> 2:01:17.408
Oh, my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!

2:01:17.544 --> 2:01:19.410
Well, I mean,
not this exactly.

2:01:19.545 --> 2:01:20.473
Like, normally,
it's Wonder Woman

2:01:20.609 --> 2:01:21.881
in the dream, but...

2:01:22.016 --> 2:01:23.278
-Ew.
-Huh?

2:01:23.414 --> 2:01:25.448
Well, that was easy.

2:01:25.583 --> 2:01:27.118
Welcome
to the Justice Society.

2:01:27.254 --> 2:01:29.152
Yeah! Aweso... Wait, what?

2:01:29.288 --> 2:01:30.521
The Justice Society?

2:01:30.657 --> 2:01:31.957
Is that different
than the Justice League?

2:01:32.093 --> 2:01:33.523
Yes. The Justice Society

2:01:33.659 --> 2:01:35.093
is different
than the Justice League

2:01:35.229 --> 2:01:36.759
because of how words work.

2:01:36.895 --> 2:01:38.726
I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group.

2:01:38.862 --> 2:01:40.961
-So, that's you guys, right?
-No.

2:01:41.097 --> 2:01:43.166
Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman, dude?

2:01:43.302 --> 2:01:45.103
He's joking, right?

2:01:45.239 --> 2:01:48.375
-No?
-Okay. I'm out.

2:01:48.510 --> 2:01:50.406
I'm gonna wait here,
'cause of the shoes.

2:01:50.541 --> 2:01:52.237
Can you drive by and get me?

2:01:52.372 --> 2:01:54.841
[Shazam] Hey, just a little
constructive criticism.

2:01:54.977 --> 2:01:56.315
It's pretty confusing
that there are

2:01:56.450 --> 2:01:58.348
two separate groups
of superheroes

2:01:58.484 --> 2:01:59.815
that are totally unaffiliated,

2:01:59.951 --> 2:02:01.921
but both have "Justice"
in their name, you know.

2:02:02.056 --> 2:02:03.951
Like, have you guys ever
thought about doing
a rebranding of sorts?

2:02:04.087 --> 2:02:07.060
'Cause just a quick search
on Thesaurus.com,

2:02:07.196 --> 2:02:08.754
you got so many options, man.

2:02:08.890 --> 2:02:11.825
Like, "Authority Society." Eh?

2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:13.627
Uh, uh, "Code Society."
That's stupid.

2:02:13.763 --> 2:02:15.200
These are, like, legal terms.

2:02:15.336 --> 2:02:18.333
[gasps] "The Avenger Society."

2:02:18.468 --> 2:02:19.732
[inhales sharply]

2:02:19.868 --> 2:02:21.639
I like that, for some reason.

2:02:24.310 --> 2:02:26.512
[gentle music playing]

2:02:41.557 --> 2:02:43.925
[music builds up]

2:02:50.534 --> 2:02:52.736
[dramatic music playing]

2:06:06.599 --> 2:06:08.800
[mysterious music playing]

2:07:34.818 --> 2:07:37.020
[intense music playing]

2:08:35.010 --> 2:08:36.943
[distant chattering]

2:08:37.079 --> 2:08:39.280
[unsettling music playing]

2:08:54.731 --> 2:08:56.594
[voice laughing]

2:08:56.730 --> 2:09:00.870
[Mister Mind] Well, well,
Doctor. We meet again.

2:09:01.006 --> 2:09:02.568
Where in the hell
have you been?

2:09:02.703 --> 2:09:05.839
[Mister Mind] To implement
the perfect plan, Doctor,

2:09:05.975 --> 2:09:08.140
one must have patience.

2:09:08.275 --> 2:09:10.047
What are you talking about?

2:09:11.619 --> 2:09:13.215
It's been two goddamn years!

2:09:13.350 --> 2:09:18.391
Yes. But what is time
but a trick of the mind?

2:09:18.526 --> 2:09:19.722
A meaningless measure.

2:09:19.857 --> 2:09:22.258
Hey. I'm 57 years old.

2:09:22.393 --> 2:09:25.491
I'm stuck in a concrete box
surrounded by lunatics

2:09:25.626 --> 2:09:27.495
waiting for a worm to enact
some, what,

2:09:27.630 --> 2:09:30.134
vague plan I've been told
absolutely nothing about?

2:09:30.269 --> 2:09:32.905
It takes me a very long time
to get places, okay?

2:09:33.040 --> 2:09:35.774
I do not have legs,
I do not have wings,

2:09:35.910 --> 2:09:39.345
I just slither around
endlessly.

2:09:39.480 --> 2:09:41.742
But not for long.

2:09:41.877 --> 2:09:43.476
[laughing]

2:09:44.717 --> 2:09:46.446
Tell me everything.

2:09:47.889 --> 2:09:49.849
Just one more thing
I need to do.

2:09:49.984 --> 2:09:52.188
What? No!

2:09:53.625 --> 2:09:55.290
Oh, goddamn it!
