No! That's the emergency hull

Never, ever, ever touch that.

[♪ dramatic music playing]

00:08.333 --> 00:10.125
This ship is the Onyx Cinder.

00:10.208 --> 00:12.791
Tak Rennod's the most infamous pirate
the galaxy's ever known.

00:12.875 --> 00:14.333
Anything he wanted,

00:15.166 --> 00:16.166
he took it.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.208
[Captain Rennod] I have the ship,
clad in armor and ready...

00:19.875 --> 00:23.041
[SM-33] But Captain Rennod scanned
At Attin's coordinates.

00:23.125 --> 00:27.625
Kept 'em hid in his lair,
deep beneath Skull Ridge Mountain.

00:27.708 --> 00:28.708
I can't go down there.

00:28.791 --> 00:31.125
[Fern] You worried about corrosion
from the steam?

00:31.208 --> 00:32.333
You'll be fine.

00:32.416 --> 00:35.000
Is that Dash Zentin?

00:35.083 --> 00:36.416
[Pokkit] Here's the coordinates.

00:36.500 --> 00:37.875
Now how about my payment?

00:37.958 --> 00:40.125
[Brutus] You'll have your payment
when I have Silvo.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.458
I invoke my right
to challenge the captain.

00:42.541 --> 00:43.541
Just say you yield.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.541
-[Jod] Just say you yield.
-[Fern] I yield.

00:49.625 --> 00:50.958
Jod is the victor.

00:51.041 --> 00:52.041

KB! KB, are you okay?

02:08.541 --> 02:09.958
What's wrong with her?

Sometimes her augs go bad

02:17.916 --> 02:21.500
[Fern] Okay, KB. I'm gonna reset
your occipital link.

Yes. I'm glad you're here.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.541

03:12.333 --> 03:17.541
I'd like to check out, refuel my ship,

03:22.333 --> 03:27.708
Oh, we've got a very special cabin
in our ship all ready for you, Silvo.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.166
I was coming to find you.

03:30.250 --> 03:34.250
Down there is the biggest pile of loot

03:34.333 --> 03:37.375
you will ever lay your eye on.

03:37.458 --> 03:38.875
[Gunter] Save it, Silvo.

03:40.541 --> 03:42.541
You're going straight to Captain Brutus.

03:42.625 --> 03:43.625
Let's go.

03:43.708 --> 03:46.166
Wait, wait. That's just a taste.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.833
I'm in line for something even bigger.
I'll cut you in.

Pirates!

04:37.291 --> 04:39.291
[Wim] Those other ships
are fighting them off!

04:39.375 --> 04:41.500
They're like the ones that Kh'ymm called.

04:41.583 --> 04:43.375
[Fern] She said they were called X-wings.

04:48.833 --> 04:50.791
[Neel] But Jod said X-wings were bad.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.041
No, they're the good guys!

-[shouting] Help! No, no!

05:04.083 --> 05:05.833
They left us!

05:07.875 --> 05:09.250
It's too bad.

05:09.333 --> 05:11.833
'Cause I have the coordinates
home and everything.

05:13.333 --> 05:14.791
So it's in your brain?

05:16.208 --> 05:17.208
[Fern] Perfect.

05:17.291 --> 05:19.625
So now we just need
to climb back to our ship.

05:21.083 --> 05:22.541
It's still there, see?

05:23.375 --> 05:24.708
That's not "perfect."

05:24.791 --> 05:26.166
It's impossible.

05:29.875 --> 05:31.208
Wim, stay here.

05:32.375 --> 05:33.583
You too, Neel.

05:34.875 --> 05:35.875
Hey.

05:39.875 --> 05:41.208
You are okay, right?

05:45.208 --> 05:46.625
[sighs]

05:46.708 --> 05:50.125
So, I just know Wim's gonna fight me
on climbing the cliff. [sighs]

05:50.208 --> 05:52.458
How should we play it?
Because, to be honest,

05:52.541 --> 05:54.416
I don't even know if Neel
is gonna be able to--

05:54.500 --> 05:56.750
Maybe we should consider
some other options.

05:59.166 --> 06:03.000
Well, we have to get back
to the ship, right?

06:04.708 --> 06:06.875
-I can't think of any other options.
-[KB] You can't.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.375
So you just assume there aren't any?

06:09.458 --> 06:10.833
Hey, KB, why are you--

06:10.916 --> 06:13.875
Because if you were actually interested,
you'd be listening for once,

06:13.958 --> 06:16.541
and maybe we'd actually
talk about something.

06:16.625 --> 06:20.083
If there's something so important
that you want to tell me, then go ahead.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.125
[Neel] Uh, Fern!

06:22.208 --> 06:24.000
[Neel shivering]

06:25.083 --> 06:26.500
We're not alone down here.

06:30.583 --> 06:31.666
Get away!

06:32.416 --> 06:33.875
They could be dangerous.

06:33.958 --> 06:36.666
-No, they're friendly.
-[Trash Crabs] Friendly, friendly.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.000
[Trash Crabs] Friendly, friendly.

06:38.083 --> 06:40.208
-[Trash Crabs] Friendly.
-See, they can talk.

06:40.291 --> 06:42.375
And that means they're intelligent.
They can help.

06:42.458 --> 06:45.875
Uh-uh. No way. Sorry, Wim. No, no, no, no.

06:45.958 --> 06:48.625
Wim, we need to climb back
to the ship and--

06:48.708 --> 06:50.333
What? Up there?

06:50.416 --> 06:53.833
No, you're gonna fall
and smash all the bones in your body.

06:53.916 --> 06:55.458
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.416
-No, I'm not!
-Yes, you are!

06:57.500 --> 06:58.583
-No, I'm not--
-Yes, you are!

06:58.666 --> 07:01.458
I'm not doing
this stupid baby fight with you!

07:01.541 --> 07:03.625
This isn't a game!

07:03.708 --> 07:05.125
I know it's not a game.

07:05.208 --> 07:07.458
-Really?
-[Neel] Stop fighting!

07:07.541 --> 07:08.791
Stop it.

07:08.875 --> 07:11.708
Okay? We all need to work together
to get back to the ship.

07:11.791 --> 07:13.750
I know. That's what I've been saying.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.666
These guys are locals.

07:15.750 --> 07:18.708
We can follow them
to someone who can help.

07:18.791 --> 07:19.875
-Follow.
-Follow.

07:19.958 --> 07:21.125
Follow.

I'm with Wim.

07:29.125 --> 07:30.208
Fine.

07:33.375 --> 07:35.125
I guess we're splitting up.

07:36.541 --> 07:37.625
Fine.

07:38.750 --> 07:39.750
I guess we are.

Let's go, Neel.

07:47.541 --> 07:51.166
Yeah, probably groups of two
makes the most sense.

We'll pick you guys up
once we get to the ship.

07:54.250 --> 07:58.666
Well, okay, but we'll already
be at the ship waiting for you.

have to divvy up your take

I failed you.

11:24.875 --> 11:26.375
I'm sorry, Kona.

You should have a command of your own.

And not just one ship.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.125
An entire fleet.

I'll bite, Silvo. What's the trick?

11:42.125 --> 11:43.208
No trick.

11:45.083 --> 11:46.208
No trick.
