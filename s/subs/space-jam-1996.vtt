WEBVTT

01:03.814 --> 01:05.189
Michael?

01:08.402 --> 01:11.404
What are you doing out here, son?
It's after midnight.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.072
Couldn't sleep, Pops.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.200
Well, neither can we,
with all that noise you're making.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.577
Come on, let's go inside.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.163
Just one more shot?

01:21.957 --> 01:24.167
All right. Just one.

01:24.334 --> 01:25.835
Yeah.

01:28.297 --> 01:30.798
That's good. Shoot it again.

01:34.511 --> 01:38.014
Getting pretty good, son.
Go ahead, shoot till you miss.

01:38.182 --> 01:40.516
You think if I can get good enough,
I can go to college?

01:40.684 --> 01:41.726
Hey...

01:43.729 --> 01:47.356
...if you get good enough,
you can do anything you want to, Michael.

01:48.150 --> 01:50.568
I want to play at North Carolina.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.530
That's a real fine school.
Real fine school.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.866
You can get a first-class education there.

01:57.034 --> 01:59.494
I want to play on a championship team.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.080
Then I want to play in the NBA.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.044
All right, let's slow down, son.

02:08.212 --> 02:10.463
Don't you think you ought
to get a little sleep first?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.423
- And once I've done all that...
- Uh-huh.

02:12.591 --> 02:14.842
...I want to play baseball,
just like you, Dad.

02:15.010 --> 02:17.929
Baseball. Now, that's a sport.

02:18.096 --> 02:22.058
And when you're finished with that,
I suppose you're gonna fly, huh?

05:55.105 --> 05:56.939
I just feel at this particular time...

05:57.107 --> 06:00.943
...that I reached the, uh, pinnacle of
my basketball career and I must retire.

06:02.279 --> 06:05.740
The one good thing that comes out of this
is that my father had the opportunity...

06:05.907 --> 06:09.577
...to see me play my last basketball game,
and that means a lot to me.

06:09.745 --> 06:11.454
What are you gonna do now?

06:11.621 --> 06:15.833
Well, I've never really told anybody this,
except for one person, and, uh...

06:16.001 --> 06:18.044
But I think I'm gonna go play
professional baseball.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.882
- What position will you play?
- I don't know. As a kid, I was a pitcher.

06:23.050 --> 06:27.303
I think that would be kind of hard for me
to pitch, so I'm gonna play the outfield.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.520
Woo-hoo!

07:19.523 --> 07:21.649
Let's get out of here, Dad. This stinks.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.776
Don't bring me here anymore, all right?

07:23.944 --> 07:27.238
- Don't bring me here anymore, all right?
Are you listening?

07:27.405 --> 07:32.201
Did you hear him? Did you hear him?
That little brat is right.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.703
I've told you, if I've told you once...

07:34.871 --> 07:39.125
...I told you a thousand, thousand,
thousand, thousand times.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.293
We need new attractions.

07:41.711 --> 07:42.711
- Right.
- New ones.

07:42.879 --> 07:43.921
Uh-huh.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.257
- Get it?
- Big, shiny new things, yeah.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.135
- Absolutely, sir.
- Look at me. Look at me and listen.

07:49.886 --> 07:51.137
The customer is always right.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.432
Right.
- The customer is always right.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.101
Exactly.

07:57.269 --> 07:58.811
Always.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.230
Right.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.983
- Okay, we need something...
My bad.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.401
We need something...

08:07.070 --> 08:09.196
...nutty.
- Nutty.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.490
- Something wacky.
Wacky.

08:11.658 --> 08:14.243
We need something, something...
Something... We need something...

08:14.411 --> 08:16.078
Looney? Oops.

08:16.246 --> 08:17.413
Looney. Thank you.

08:17.581 --> 08:18.873
Looney?

08:21.251 --> 08:23.669
I'm an elk. Shoot me.

08:28.216 --> 08:30.259
Yes. Looney. Yes.

08:30.427 --> 08:34.096
Now you're talking.
Looney. Looney. That's it.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.765
That's the word I was looking for.
Looney.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.185
- Get the Looney Tunes.
- Looney Tunes!

08:39.352 --> 08:43.105
- Bring them here.
Sir. Just noticing, sir.

08:43.273 --> 08:46.192
They're from Earth.
What if they can't come?

08:46.735 --> 08:50.070
What did you say?
What if they can't come?

08:51.489 --> 08:53.490
- Make them.
- Cool.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.534
Make them. Ha-ha-ha.

08:55.702 --> 08:59.413
We're gonna go get them. Yeah. All right.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.590
Strike!

09:12.844 --> 09:14.178
Looks good in that uniform.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.639
Looks great. Can't teach that.

09:16.806 --> 09:17.806
Can't teach it.

09:17.974 --> 09:21.143
Thanks for autographing that basketball
for my kid. I'm a hero now.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.853
No problem. Happy to do it, man.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.647
Let's go!

09:28.151 --> 09:30.653
Curve ball. Don't swing.

09:31.655 --> 09:33.656
Don't swing.

09:40.997 --> 09:42.498
Ball!

09:46.211 --> 09:48.629
Fastball, outside corner. Swing.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.886
Strike!

09:56.054 --> 09:57.221
That was your pitch.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.681
I know, I missed it.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.809
Don't worry. I'll get you another one.

10:04.688 --> 10:07.189
Podolak. Podolak, come here.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.524
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

10:08.692 --> 10:11.318
- Come here.
- Yes, sir?

10:11.486 --> 10:15.572
Make sure nobody bothers Michael. I want
him to be the happiest player in the world.

10:15.740 --> 10:16.865
The happiest.

10:17.993 --> 10:20.327
Slider. Don't swing.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.750
Strike three!

10:26.918 --> 10:28.043
I told you not to swing.

10:28.211 --> 10:29.336
I couldn't help it.

10:29.504 --> 10:31.672
I understand. Hey, nice talking to you.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.557
We're not worried. We're not worried.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.646
Good job, Mike.
Good hustle.

10:47.814 --> 10:49.189
Good cut, Michael. Good cut.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.234
That was a strikeout, Mike?
Good-looking strikeout. Real good.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.571
You look good when you strike out.
When I strike out, it looks nasty, man.

10:55.739 --> 10:58.073
At least you look good, man.
Good-looking.

10:59.451 --> 11:00.909
Hi, Mr. Jordan.

11:01.745 --> 11:03.662
Mr. Jordan, I'm Stan Podolak...

11:07.876 --> 11:10.502
Oh, jeez.

11:13.631 --> 11:17.426
- You all right? That was a nasty fall.
- Yeah.

11:17.594 --> 11:21.889
Oh. I'm Stan Podolak, Mr. Jordan.
I'm the Barons' new publicist.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.435
I'm here to make your life easier.
Want me to drive you somewhere?

11:26.603 --> 11:29.980
Want me to pick up your laundry,
babysit your kids? I will do it.

11:30.148 --> 11:35.778
I am here to personally guarantee
that no one will ever bother you.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.080
What was that?

11:51.461 --> 11:52.503
Hang on.

11:52.670 --> 11:55.672
- Hanging on.
- Hanging on.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.883
BLANKO:
Are we there yet?

12:06.142 --> 12:07.643
- Bombastic.
- Cool.

12:18.947 --> 12:20.948
All right, you irascible bunny.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.325
Come back here, you screwy rodent.

12:23.493 --> 12:27.996
I'll, uh, be with you in a second, folks,
after I finish with nature boy here.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.834
All right, you pesky rabbit.
I've got you now.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.421
Ouch!

12:36.005 --> 12:37.047
Hmm.

12:39.676 --> 12:42.928
One small step for moi...

12:43.096 --> 12:45.931
One giant leap for Moron Mountain.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.561
And one whopper headache for
Elmer Fudd.

12:55.191 --> 12:57.192
Diminutive, ain't they?

12:57.360 --> 13:00.237
- We seek the one they call Bugs Bunny.
- Yeah, Bugs Bunny.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.239
- Have you seen him?
- Where is this guy?

13:02.407 --> 13:04.199
Is he around?

13:04.367 --> 13:07.786
Hmm. Bugs Bunny, Bugs Bunny.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.956
Say, does he have, uh,
great big long ears?

13:11.124 --> 13:13.542
- Like this?
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.795
And does he hop around like this?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.884
- Yeah.
- Well, uh...

13:22.051 --> 13:24.303
...does he say, "What's up, doc?"
Like this:

13:26.514 --> 13:29.683
- Eh, what's up, doc?
- Yeah!

13:29.851 --> 13:31.852
Nope. Never heard of him.

13:34.522 --> 13:39.776
You know, maybe there is no intelligent life
out there in the universe after all.

13:43.448 --> 13:46.617
Hold on there, Mr. Looney Tune.

13:46.784 --> 13:49.036
Hey, what do you think we are, stupid?

13:49.204 --> 13:51.705
Don't move a muscle.

13:52.415 --> 13:56.210
Okay, bunny, gather up your Tune pals.

13:56.377 --> 13:59.296
- We're taking you for a ride. Ha, ha.
NAWT: Move it, mister.

13:59.464 --> 14:02.966
Totally. All right.
So, like, where are we going?

14:06.930 --> 14:08.931
Are we there yet?

14:09.224 --> 14:11.266
Sorry it took so long.
Don't worry.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.603
That exit wasn't clearly marked.
Hold up, right here.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.230
What, here?
Yes.

14:21.152 --> 14:23.070
Thanks for the ride, Sherm.
Appreciate it.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.030
- It's Stan, Mike.
- Sorry.

14:25.198 --> 14:28.617
But you can call me Sherm if you want to.
I've followed your whole career.

14:28.785 --> 14:31.662
- You're the greatest athlete that's ever lived.
- Stan, Stan, Stan.

14:32.997 --> 14:34.957
How do I get out?
The door doesn't work.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.126
- I'm sorry. I forgot... It's a classic.
- Oh, yeah.

14:38.294 --> 14:41.964
It's a classic, but it's got a few
peccadilloes. Hold on just a second.

14:42.131 --> 14:45.300
A few, huh? It's smoking, too, man.
You need to get that checked.

14:47.428 --> 14:48.971
Thanks for the ride.

14:49.138 --> 14:50.639
Oh.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.809
Oh, this is nice. This is a nice house.

14:53.977 --> 14:56.061
That is a beauty. What is that, Colonial?

14:56.229 --> 14:57.479
It's a nice house.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.982
If you need anything done
around the house, I'd be happy...

15:00.149 --> 15:02.276
- Oh, no, I'm fine, thanks.
- Anything you need.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.444
- You gave me a ride. I appreciate it.
- Sure.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.114
Tomorrow I'm gonna drive, okay?
So I don't need the ride.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.658
But thanks, though.

15:09.826 --> 15:10.951
Too conspicuous?

15:12.370 --> 15:13.495
Yeah.

15:15.206 --> 15:18.375
- All right. All right.
- Thanks, though.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.836
- Tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.846
Come on, dog. No, not today.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.890
Dog, get off me. Your breath.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.018
- Mr. Jordan, are you okay?
- Get off of me!

15:36.185 --> 15:37.394
Get off of him, Charles.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.646
- Bad dog. Git.
- Get off of him.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.524
- Get off me, Charles.
- Get off of him before I cook you.

15:42.692 --> 15:45.402
Come on, come on.
Come on, baby. Come on.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.744
Get out of the car!

15:56.414 --> 15:58.081
Good game.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.500
Hey, Jeff, you okay?

16:06.799 --> 16:08.717
- How was your game?
JEFF: I don't want to talk.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.552
- Hi, Dad.
Hey, hey.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.180
Michael!

16:14.891 --> 16:17.225
- Daddy, Daddy!
- How you doing?

16:17.393 --> 16:19.728
Hey.
Hey.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.607
- Ooh. You're all covered with drool, baby.
- That's your dog.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.068
- What's wrong with Jeff?
- He went two for five...

16:26.235 --> 16:28.362
...lost 32 points in his average.
- Is that all?

16:28.529 --> 16:31.740
Yeah, so that puts him at like a.685
or something.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.575
He's batting what?

16:33.951 --> 16:36.870
Mm.
Smells good in here. What you cooking?

16:37.038 --> 16:39.915
Chicken.
- Chicken and what?

16:40.083 --> 16:42.918
- Chicken and collard greens.
- Good. I'm gonna need a good meal tonight.

16:46.422 --> 16:47.589
Is everything okay?

16:47.965 --> 16:51.301
I stunk up the place.
I hope this baseball thing was a good idea.

16:51.469 --> 16:54.680
It was another career day for Michael Jordan
at Barons Field this afternoon.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.098
Let's face it. This baseball...

16:56.265 --> 16:58.183
What are you guys watching?

16:58.351 --> 17:01.228
- Today he had three strikeouts.
- Is this the only thing on TV?

17:01.396 --> 17:04.189
- That brings his batting average down...
- What's up with this?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.566
...to an anemic.214,
which is also his weight.

17:06.734 --> 17:10.487
Baseball bat?
Get this guy a tennis racquet.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.572
Did everyone get mad at you?

17:13.741 --> 17:16.827
No. Worse.
Everyone was real nice about it.

17:16.994 --> 17:20.539
Michael, I know golf is your sport,
but not here.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.916
I think you should open up
your stance a little.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.335
It might make you more aggressive
at the plate.

17:25.503 --> 17:29.923
- You think so? I'll try to remember that.
- Watching this hurts me more than you.

17:30.091 --> 17:34.010
What are you guys doing
watching this stuff? It's bad for you.

17:39.976 --> 17:44.563
There you go. Road Runner. Beep, beep.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.405
Oh. Stop this cartoon.

17:55.408 --> 18:00.996
We've got an emergency
Cartoon Character Union Meeting to go to.

18:01.956 --> 18:06.001
Hey, wait for me. Hold your horses.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.259
Dang. Where'd they go?

18:21.225 --> 18:24.060
- Stop the music. Top duck coming through.
Hey!

18:24.228 --> 18:28.190
Jeez. It's getting so a guy can't even
get himself wet around here.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.650
So, what's the big emergency?

18:30.985 --> 18:34.780
Uh, these little guys would like to make
an announcement. Here you go, shorty.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.324
- Go.
- All right, all right.

18:38.785 --> 18:43.371
You, all of you, are now our prisoners.

18:47.084 --> 18:50.212
We're in big trouble now.

18:51.088 --> 18:54.216
We are taking you to our theme park
in outer space.

18:54.383 --> 18:56.885
- No fooling.
- Where you'll be our slaves.

18:57.053 --> 19:00.555
And placed on display for the amusement
of our paying customers.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.558
Oh, fear clutches my breast.

19:05.478 --> 19:09.648
We ain't going nowheres.

19:15.530 --> 19:17.864
Eh, not so fast, doc.

19:18.032 --> 19:21.117
You just can't turn us into slaves.
That would be bad.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.578
You've gotta give us a chance
to defend ourselves.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.373
- Oh, yeah? Who says?
Says who?

19:26.541 --> 19:27.707
Why?
- Just a sec.

19:28.459 --> 19:31.461
- There. Read them and weep.
- What's this?

19:31.629 --> 19:35.006
"Give them a chance
to defend themselves."

19:35.174 --> 19:36.883
Aw. Do we have to?

19:37.051 --> 19:38.468
- It's in the rule book.
- It is.

19:38.636 --> 19:40.804
Okay. It is in the rule book.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.432
We have to confer.

19:46.936 --> 19:52.440
All right, troops. It is for us to choose
a battlefield that affords us...

19:52.608 --> 19:54.234
Oh, I got it.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.903
Yes, Private Porkster?

19:57.071 --> 19:59.948
How about we challenge them to a...

20:00.950 --> 20:02.659
...spelling bee?
- Say...

20:02.827 --> 20:04.953
...we could have a bowling tournament.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.290
Suffering succotash.

20:08.457 --> 20:10.292
What's wrong with all of you?

20:10.459 --> 20:11.960
I say we get a ladder...

20:12.128 --> 20:14.421
...wait till the old lady's out of the room...

20:14.589 --> 20:17.465
...then grab that little bird.

20:17.633 --> 20:21.011
Whoa, whoa, take a deep breath, Sly.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.848
Okay, let's analyze the competition.

20:25.349 --> 20:30.979
Now, uh, what are we looking at here?
We got a small race of invading aliens.

20:31.147 --> 20:34.399
Small arms. Short legs.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.151
Not very fast.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.069
Tiny little guys.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.614
Can't jump high.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.699
Ah.

20:45.286 --> 20:48.914
We challenge you to a basketball game.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.124
All right. Basketball it is.

20:51.292 --> 20:53.001
- Basketball.
- Basketball.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.420
- Boy, oh, boy.
- All right.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.630
What is basketball?

20:56.797 --> 20:57.839
- What's that?
- Beats me.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.507
We didn't have that in school.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.344
- Lights.
Pardon me. Sorry.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.512
Hey! Down in front.

21:04.680 --> 21:06.806
An exhilarating team sport...

21:06.974 --> 21:11.561
...currently growing rapidly in popularity
is basketball.

21:11.729 --> 21:16.524
Unlike football and baseball,
only five men can play on a team.

21:16.692 --> 21:21.363
It's a fast-paced, razzle-dazzle game
that requires quick wits...

21:21.530 --> 21:23.865
...and even faster reflexes.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.868
Here's how it's done
in the professional ranks...

21:27.036 --> 21:32.540
...the National Basketball Association,
featuring the best players in the world.

21:32.708 --> 21:36.419
- The best players in the world.
- The best.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.441
Excuse me. Oh, so sorry.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.068
Excuse me.

22:00.945 --> 22:02.570
Ow. Get your feet out of my nose.

22:02.738 --> 22:04.739
Quiet, they're looking.

22:04.907 --> 22:08.243
Hey, it's basketball.

22:08.411 --> 22:10.787
Where?
Whoa. Now what?

22:14.792 --> 22:15.875
Hey, hey!
What?

22:16.043 --> 22:17.877
She's looking again.
Close it up.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.462
- Tightly.
- Aah.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.172
You poked me again.

22:22.925 --> 22:24.009
- Sweetheart?
- What?

22:24.176 --> 22:27.262
- I thought you'd get better seats.
- This is as good as I could get.

22:27.430 --> 22:30.682
This guy next to me is doing something
very weird in his raincoat.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.893
Honey, will you just let me watch the game?
Barkley's killing us.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.479
Hey, someone's killing someone.

22:36.647 --> 22:38.356
No. Seriously?

22:38.733 --> 22:41.067
Wow, a killer.
Let me see.

22:43.279 --> 22:44.988
There. That's him, the killer.

22:46.991 --> 22:48.158
He's big.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.076
He's good.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.453
He's mine.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.997
Okay, go get him.
Yeah.

23:07.303 --> 23:11.514
Get back on defense.
Let's go. Get back on defense, man.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.730
What are you doing?

23:26.530 --> 23:28.239
Time out. Call time out.

23:29.617 --> 23:32.160
What's wrong with you, man?
You're killing us.

23:32.328 --> 23:34.996
- Let him in. Open up.
- Open.

23:35.164 --> 23:37.874
Wow. He did it.

23:38.042 --> 23:40.627
I got it. I got his talent.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.045
- All right.
- Super.

23:42.213 --> 23:45.131
- Sit down, Chuck.
- Man, I'm fine. I am fine.

23:45.299 --> 23:47.092
No, no. I played you too many minutes.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.053
- But I'm not tired.
- Go get the doctor.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.939
- What's up, man? You all right?
- Yeah.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.816
You sure?

24:03.609 --> 24:07.070
Come on, we're okay.
You're okay. Come on, let's go.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.036
Come on, Patrick. It's showtime.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.664
What's wrong with him?

24:24.630 --> 24:26.047
Popcorn...

24:26.340 --> 24:27.632
In a shocking development...

24:27.800 --> 24:31.553
...five NBA players have been placed
on the disabled list in the last 24 hours...

24:31.720 --> 24:34.013
...all suffering from the same
mysterious ailment.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.765
- Yeah? Hmm.
- Whatever this mystery is...

24:35.933 --> 24:39.519
...it affects the player's coordination.
- I'll be home in a couple days.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.938
- Watch Patrick Ewing.
- Put your mom on the phone.

24:43.566 --> 24:46.401
- It wasn't just in New York.
- Hey, baby. How you doing?

24:46.569 --> 24:50.321
- Check out the highlights.
- You watching TV?

24:52.324 --> 24:53.741
What the hell is going on?

24:53.909 --> 24:58.663
- You gonna be all right?
- I'm ready, coach. All right.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.291
Looks like I retired just in time.

25:03.252 --> 25:07.922
All right, baby, gotta go.
I'll call you later, okay? Love you. Bye.

25:08.090 --> 25:09.132
It's open!

25:09.633 --> 25:12.719
Come on, it's game time.
Get your Hanes on. Lace up your Nikes.

25:12.887 --> 25:16.347
Grab your Wheaties and your Gatorade
and we'll pick up a Big Mac on the way.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.892
Now we take you live
to the Forum in Los Angeles...

25:19.059 --> 25:21.394
...where the Lakers are refusing
to take the court.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.315
Guys, we gotta get dressed.

25:25.482 --> 25:29.277
We got a game in five minutes.
I mean, we're talking about a huge fine here.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.529
- No, we can't go in the locker room.
- Oh, man.

25:31.697 --> 25:34.908
You heard what happened to Barkley
and Ewing. There's germs in there.

25:35.075 --> 25:38.203
Cedric, that was in New York,
3000 miles away.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.997
Bacteria can travel faster
than the speed of light.

25:41.165 --> 25:44.292
- It could be Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
Yeah, could be.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.836
All right. Dress in the hallway.

25:47.129 --> 25:49.380
Okay.

25:52.092 --> 25:57.180
Okay, okay, now, which one of you maroons
has ever played basketball before?

25:57.348 --> 26:01.768
I have, coach. And there's an important
strategic question I need to ask you.

26:01.936 --> 26:03.144
Yes, yes?

26:06.899 --> 26:10.318
What do you think? I'm kind of partial
to purple and gold, myself.

26:10.486 --> 26:12.987
It goes better with my coloring.
A one, two, three, four.

26:13.155 --> 26:15.615
Guys? Nice outfit, Daffy.

26:15.783 --> 26:20.495
The little aliens say it's their turn
to, uh, use the court.

26:20.663 --> 26:23.915
Sure, let the little pipsqueaks
knock themselves out.

26:24.083 --> 26:27.001
Too bad you can't practice
getting taller, boys.

26:34.802 --> 26:36.844
Whoa!
Ah!

27:07.334 --> 27:08.584
Hey, little pig.

27:09.712 --> 27:11.671
- Boo.
- Aah!

27:13.048 --> 27:14.966
I wet myself.

27:17.970 --> 27:21.014
Time to play a little basketball.

27:25.394 --> 27:28.271
Those little pipsqueaks
just turned into superstars.

27:28.439 --> 27:31.065
They're monsters.

27:31.233 --> 27:33.109
Suffering succotash.

27:33.277 --> 27:35.361
They're Monstars.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.574
Bye-bye.

27:42.077 --> 27:45.121
Eh,
I think we might need a little bit of help.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.583
A hundred and seventy-five yards.

27:48.751 --> 27:52.920
Okay, little fella.
You my friend or are you my enemy?

27:53.088 --> 27:55.673
You are my friend, right?
You are my ally.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.427
You are my associate,
my personal assistant.

27:59.595 --> 28:02.889
You are my weapon. You are leaving.

28:04.350 --> 28:07.310
- Great shot.
- Nice shot, Mr. Murray.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.150
You can stop posing now.

28:16.904 --> 28:18.780
- Good try.
- Not bad, not bad.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.032
BILL: Something for you to shoot at.
- Hit it good.

28:21.200 --> 28:23.076
Do my best.

28:24.453 --> 28:26.120
It was a good shot.

28:26.288 --> 28:28.164
Yeah, I know.

28:28.332 --> 28:29.791
Mike, I gotta ask you something.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.584
The NBA has to face reality.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.878
What's happening to these players
is serious.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.714
They're gonna need new players
with talent.

28:36.882 --> 28:40.968
Guys who are skilled, but never really
thought about a professional career before.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.138
You think I got a shot?

28:46.141 --> 28:47.558
- Come on, really?
- No.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.229
- Don't kid me.
- Listen. It's a man's game.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.689
- You can't play.
- What if I tried really hard?

28:53.857 --> 28:55.900
Keep it down. I'm trying to hit this ball.

28:56.193 --> 28:57.944
It's because I'm white, isn't it?

28:58.112 --> 29:00.279
No. Larry's white. So what?

29:00.447 --> 29:03.991
Larry's not white. Larry's clear.

29:05.369 --> 29:06.994
- Good shot, Larry.
That's nice.

29:07.162 --> 29:09.038
Get inside his ball.

29:09.331 --> 29:10.415
Whoa.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.208
You clowns can't beat that.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.460
- My best shot ever.
- You haven't played long.

29:14.628 --> 29:15.670
A Hall-of-Fame shot.

29:15.838 --> 29:18.089
- Really nice shot, Mr. Bird.
LARRY: Larry, please.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.508
- Nice shot, Mr. Larry.
- Nice shot, Larry.

29:20.676 --> 29:22.427
You can do this.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.846
Don't be nervous. You can do this.

29:25.013 --> 29:27.807
Larry, you feel that the NBA
has to face reality, don't you?

29:27.975 --> 29:31.310
Gotta look for more dominant players
in places they never looked before.

29:31.478 --> 29:34.230
Just look at the ball.
Visualize where you want it to go.

29:34.398 --> 29:37.525
- Right, right, right.
- Be the ball. Be the ball.

29:37.693 --> 29:38.943
Get off the tee.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.903
You can't jump.

29:42.406 --> 29:43.823
I... Yeah, go on.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.993
- Close to the pin?
Close to the pin? For dinner?

29:47.161 --> 29:49.454
Sounds good.
I'll go close to the pin.

29:49.621 --> 29:51.706
- Okay, cool.
- I'll take some of that.

29:54.168 --> 29:55.334
That's not bad.

29:56.003 --> 29:57.211
Good shot.

29:57.379 --> 29:59.130
Get down.

30:00.048 --> 30:02.216
Look at that. Look at that spin.

30:13.270 --> 30:14.562
Come on.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.191
It is alive.

30:21.236 --> 30:26.115
Yes! Yes! My first hole in one. Yes!

30:26.617 --> 30:27.658
Oh.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.328
Don't say it.
Never seen one of these before.

30:30.496 --> 30:34.499
Larry, nothing but the bottom of the cup.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.335
That's his ball too.
- Yeah, yeah, it's my ball. Sorry.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.337
- Let me get a picture.
- You guys are jealous.

30:39.505 --> 30:43.966
All right, here we go. Now, you gotta smile.
Reach in for the ball and then smile, okay?

30:44.134 --> 30:45.843
- Yes.
- And you think, "This is good."

30:46.011 --> 30:47.470
Just take the picture.
- Okay.

30:57.606 --> 30:59.273
- What kind of camera is that?
- Just...

30:59.441 --> 31:01.359
Don't point it at me. Close the lens cap.

31:01.527 --> 31:03.486
- I didn't do anything.
- Where did he go?

31:08.242 --> 31:09.742
Hey!

31:10.327 --> 31:13.037
No, no, no!

31:24.967 --> 31:28.469
Oh, uh, look out for that first step,
doc, it's a real lulu.

31:29.096 --> 31:30.137
Bugs Bunny?

31:30.305 --> 31:32.431
Eh, you were expecting
maybe the Easter Bunny?

31:33.100 --> 31:35.518
- You're a cartoon. You're not real.
- Not real, eh?

31:35.686 --> 31:37.979
If I weren't real, could I do this?

31:41.024 --> 31:42.441
Ugh.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.235
Oh, look. Is that Michael?

31:44.403 --> 31:46.070
It's Michael.

31:46.238 --> 31:47.655
It's Air Jordan.

31:48.657 --> 31:50.449
Basketball.

31:50.617 --> 31:52.660
Ooh. I tought I taw...

31:53.078 --> 31:56.372
I did. I did see Michael Jordan.

31:56.540 --> 32:00.626
Pardon me, Mr. Jordan.
Uh, can I have your auto...?

32:00.794 --> 32:02.169
Your John Hancock, please?

32:02.337 --> 32:04.463
Back off. Let the doctor take a look.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.427
- A little high.
- No.

32:09.595 --> 32:10.761
Going down.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.680
No!

32:17.894 --> 32:21.022
So, what do you say we go
for a little spin?

32:23.859 --> 32:27.069
Hmm.
Now, let's see what we got inside here.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.115
Say "ah."

32:33.035 --> 32:35.578
All right. He's okay.

32:37.080 --> 32:40.750
- What's going on here?
- Why, Michael, I thought you'd never ask.

32:41.251 --> 32:45.254
These aliens from outer space want
to make us slaves in their theme park.

32:45.422 --> 32:46.881
What do we care? They're little.

32:47.049 --> 32:49.258
So we challenged them
to a basketball game.

32:49.426 --> 32:52.345
But then they show up
and they ain't so little. They're huge.

32:52.512 --> 32:55.806
We need to beat these guys,
because they're talking about slavery.

32:55.974 --> 32:59.852
They'll make us do stand-up comedy,
the same jokes every night for all eternity.

33:00.020 --> 33:03.397
We'll be locked up like wild animals
and then trotted out to perform...

33:03.565 --> 33:07.693
...for a bunch of lowbrow, bug-eyed,
fat-headed, humor-challenged aliens.

33:07.861 --> 33:10.488
Uh, what I'm trying to say is...

33:10.656 --> 33:12.948
...we need your help!

33:13.700 --> 33:15.409
Yeah, but I'm a baseball player now.

33:15.577 --> 33:19.830
Right. And I'm a Shakespearean actor.

33:23.043 --> 33:27.838
Mike? Michael? It's Stan. Stan Podolak.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.675
Uh, look,
I need you to come out now, okay?

33:30.842 --> 33:32.968
Because you got a baseball game
tomorrow.

33:33.136 --> 33:36.931
And I'd look pretty stupid
if you don't show up.

33:37.099 --> 33:39.767
Think Michael's all right?
I hate to leave him like this.

33:39.935 --> 33:44.063
I'm sure he's fine. I think he just had to
get away from that Stan character.

33:44.231 --> 33:46.357
- God, he's pathetic, isn't he?
- Yeah.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.359
I'm gonna give us both twos back there.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.778
We weren't in any kind of
emotional state to putt.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.697
- I think that's fair.
- Yeah.

33:52.864 --> 33:57.284
Now, if Mike is gone,
the NBA is gonna need some new people.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.744
There's room at the top.

33:58.912 --> 34:01.706
An exciting guy who could maybe
even perform at half-time.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.667
You still tight with David Stern?
A phone call from you...

34:04.960 --> 34:08.754
Look, I want to help, but I haven't
played basketball in a long time.

34:08.922 --> 34:11.298
- My timing's all off.
- Eh, we'll fix your timing.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.467
Look at our facilities.

34:13.635 --> 34:15.970
We've got hoops.

34:16.138 --> 34:17.805
We got weights.

34:18.306 --> 34:21.058
We've got balls. Whoa!

34:21.226 --> 34:23.394
You sure do. This place is a mess.

34:23.562 --> 34:26.063
Mess?
You're worried about a little mess?

34:26.231 --> 34:29.483
There's nothing here
a little spit shine wouldn't fix.

34:29.651 --> 34:31.902
- Spit shine!
- Spit shine!

34:50.756 --> 34:52.381
Lemony-fresh.

34:52.549 --> 34:54.258
You guys are nuts.

34:54.426 --> 34:57.470
Correction: We're Looney Tunes.

34:57.637 --> 35:03.350
And as such are the exclusive property
and trademark of Warner Bros. Inc.

35:11.693 --> 35:13.527
I'm here.

35:14.321 --> 35:16.322
Me too.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.616
That hurt.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.119
Who are these guys?

35:22.287 --> 35:26.916
Well, uh, remember the tiny aliens
I told you about?

35:27.083 --> 35:28.292
Oh.

35:28.460 --> 35:32.296
You heard of the Dream Team?
Well, we're the Mean Team, wussy-man.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.381
- Wussy-man.
- Wussy-man?

35:34.549 --> 35:37.843
We're the Monstars. M-O-N... Um...

35:38.011 --> 35:40.554
Let's see what you got, chump.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.307
I don't play basketball anymore.

35:43.475 --> 35:45.935
"I don't play basketball anymore."

35:47.312 --> 35:49.230
Maybe you're chicken.

35:50.857 --> 35:53.526
I say, I resemble that remark.

35:53.693 --> 35:54.735
You calling me chicken?

35:54.903 --> 35:56.529
Hey. Come here.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.618
Here you go. Take him.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.205
Watch the footwork. Can you believe it?

36:07.415 --> 36:10.417
Get out of the way.

36:13.839 --> 36:17.675
Hey, everybody. Look at your hero now.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.681
You guys are making a big mistake.

36:23.849 --> 36:27.142
You're all washed up, baldy.

36:27.310 --> 36:28.435
Baldy?

36:28.603 --> 36:29.979
He is not washed up.

36:30.146 --> 36:31.939
- Michael's the greatest ever.
- Shut up.

36:32.232 --> 36:33.858
Ooh.

36:36.695 --> 36:38.821
My poor little cranium.

36:38.989 --> 36:42.408
- You okay?
- Yeah, are you okay?

36:42.576 --> 36:43.617
Whoops.

36:43.785 --> 36:47.496
You're not scared of them,
are you, Michael?

36:56.882 --> 36:59.133
- Let's play some basketball.
TUNES: Yeah.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.598
Yeah, serve her! Come on! Rebound!

37:21.072 --> 37:23.991
You're...
You're Charles Barkley.

37:25.702 --> 37:28.662
Girls. Come on over. Hurry up. Hurry.

37:28.830 --> 37:31.040
Look. It's Charles Barkley.

37:31.207 --> 37:32.249
Hey, can I play?

37:58.818 --> 38:00.611
You're not Charles Barkley.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.780
Just a wannabe who looks like him.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.283
Sorry. Break out.

38:06.451 --> 38:08.953
You shouldn't even be here. Be gone.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.664
Wannabe. Be gone.

38:11.915 --> 38:13.666
Just a few more tests, gentlemen.

38:13.833 --> 38:18.379
Electrolyte levels, glucose,
CBCs, RBCs, etcetera.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.756
And we've scheduled a 12-lead
stress test...

38:20.924 --> 38:24.635
...and neurological battery
to include EEG, reflex tests...

38:25.136 --> 38:30.307
And this girl, 5-feet-nothing,
blocked my shot.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.977
When did you first start having
this dream?

38:33.144 --> 38:35.813
It wasn't a dream. It really happened.

38:38.483 --> 38:42.903
And it climbed up my back
and into my brain.

38:43.071 --> 38:46.991
Are there any other areas
besides basketball...

38:47.158 --> 38:52.204
...where you find yourself
unable to perform?

38:54.708 --> 38:56.959
- No.
- Just asking.

38:59.963 --> 39:04.133
I've been MRI'd, EKG'd,
x-rayed, laser beamed...

39:04.300 --> 39:06.468
I promise I'll never swear again.

39:06.636 --> 39:08.595
I'll never get another technical.

39:08.763 --> 39:09.930
I'll never trash-talk.

39:10.098 --> 39:11.306
I've got other skills.

39:11.474 --> 39:14.018
- I could go back and work on the farm.
- Really?

39:14.185 --> 39:17.646
Or maybe I could go back to the jungle
and be a missionary again.

39:17.814 --> 39:20.816
What are you saying?
That I'm trying to disobey my mama?

39:20.984 --> 39:22.776
I didn't say that. You did, Muggsy.

39:22.944 --> 39:24.069
But I love my mama.

39:24.237 --> 39:26.280
Still can't find anything wrong with us.

39:26.448 --> 39:28.115
Hey, maybe nothing's wrong with us.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.534
That's right, Muggs.
Maybe it's just in our head.

39:30.702 --> 39:33.245
We're fine.
It's just some psychosomatic deal.

39:33.413 --> 39:36.081
Or something to do with the moon,
or the alignment of the planet.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.293
I'll never go out with Madonna again.

39:43.882 --> 39:45.382
What are you doing?

39:45.550 --> 39:48.802
- I'm, uh... I'm fixing a divot.
- Oh.

39:50.680 --> 39:53.098
He's fixing a divot!

40:22.921 --> 40:25.255
Has anyone here ever played basketball?

40:25.423 --> 40:27.508
Um, I have.

40:28.343 --> 40:29.968
I'd like to try out for the team.

40:31.012 --> 40:33.972
- Hey.
- Hi. My name is Lola Bunny.

40:34.140 --> 40:36.934
- Lola?
- Ha, ha. Yes.

40:37.102 --> 40:40.854
Hello. Eh, my name is Bugs.

40:41.022 --> 40:43.524
Ahem. You want to play a little
one-on-one, doll?

40:44.067 --> 40:45.651
- "Doll"?
- Uh-huh.

40:45.819 --> 40:50.280
- On the court, Bugs.
- Sure.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.532
Ooh. She's hot.

40:52.909 --> 40:54.743
There she goes.

40:54.911 --> 40:57.788
- Ready?
- Yes.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.749
I got it. I got it.

41:03.545 --> 41:05.003
That girl's got some skills.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.298
Yes?

41:11.136 --> 41:14.680
Don't ever call me "doll."

41:15.557 --> 41:17.182
Check.

41:19.227 --> 41:21.645
Hey, nice playing with you.

41:21.813 --> 41:22.855
Very smooth.

41:23.022 --> 41:26.024
Ah, she's obviously nuts about me.

41:26.192 --> 41:27.234
Obviously.

41:28.611 --> 41:30.237
Okay. Where's the ball?

41:31.865 --> 41:33.157
Let's do some drills.

41:38.913 --> 41:40.956
Can anyone lend me a pair of sneakers?

41:41.124 --> 41:43.417
Uh, sneakers?

41:47.255 --> 41:49.131
- Sorry.
- Someone has to go to my house...

41:49.299 --> 41:52.217
...and pick up my basketball gear.
- To your house?

41:52.385 --> 41:54.178
- In 3-D land?
Yeah.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.430
Whatever you do...

41:56.598 --> 41:58.599
...don't forget my North Carolina shorts.

41:58.766 --> 42:01.435
Your shorts? From college?

42:01.603 --> 42:04.438
I wore them under my Chicago Bulls
uniform every game.

42:05.815 --> 42:07.941
Hey. I washed them after every game.

42:08.109 --> 42:09.276
- Yeah.
- Sure.

42:09.444 --> 42:10.819
- I did.
- Gross.

42:12.447 --> 42:15.115
The view back here stinks.

42:15.283 --> 42:16.825
Whoa.
What?

42:16.993 --> 42:18.994
We're right in front of Michael's house.

42:19.162 --> 42:20.621
I knew that.

42:20.788 --> 42:23.498
Shh. Okay, let's go in this way.

42:23.666 --> 42:26.168
I say, let's go in that way.

42:27.295 --> 42:30.214
He just never learns.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.467
Now, let me see.

42:33.635 --> 42:38.055
I must be very, very close.

42:40.225 --> 42:41.391
Mother.

42:47.273 --> 42:49.191
Nice digs.

42:51.694 --> 42:55.614
Well, well. I wonder who that could be.

42:57.283 --> 43:00.369
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.

43:00.536 --> 43:03.538
Shh. Everyone's sleeping.

43:03.706 --> 43:05.707
- I knew that.
- Come on, come on.

43:05.875 --> 43:08.043
We gotta find Michael's basketball stuff.

43:09.712 --> 43:12.172
Nope. Nothing in here.

43:12.882 --> 43:16.343
Nope. Ah, but a very nice dinette set.

43:16.511 --> 43:19.054
Uh-uh. Not here.

43:19.222 --> 43:20.639
Let's look upstairs.

43:20.807 --> 43:22.933
Yes, oh, fearless leader.

43:23.768 --> 43:27.229
So he needs his special underwear.

43:27.397 --> 43:29.022
Oh. Shh.

43:29.190 --> 43:32.067
Sorry.
You think she's got enough toys?

43:32.235 --> 43:36.280
Speaking of toys, you know all
those mugs and t-shirts and lunch boxes...

43:36.447 --> 43:38.490
...with our pictures on them?
- Yeah.

43:38.658 --> 43:40.784
You, uh, ever see any money
from all that stuff?

43:40.952 --> 43:43.620
Ha. Not a cent.
Hmm. Me neither.

43:43.788 --> 43:44.955
It's a crying shame.

43:45.123 --> 43:48.250
We gotta get new agents.
We're getting screwed.

43:48.418 --> 43:49.960
We have found the trophy room.

43:50.128 --> 43:52.045
Now spread out and search the place.

43:52.213 --> 43:55.382
Yes, sahib. Oh, brother.

43:55.550 --> 43:58.760
Here I am, in the peak of my form
playing second banana...

43:58.928 --> 44:01.555
...to some sort of a harebrain.
- Yap, yap, yap. Hmm.

44:01.723 --> 44:04.308
This could be useful. Aha.

44:04.726 --> 44:06.268
If this were a union job, I...

44:07.061 --> 44:08.312
That's very nice.

44:09.439 --> 44:11.356
Oh, one of his shoes.

44:16.571 --> 44:18.071
Where is that other shoe?

44:19.949 --> 44:21.825
Where are you?

44:22.660 --> 44:24.077
Eureka!

44:25.079 --> 44:26.663
Come to Papa.

44:29.667 --> 44:33.003
- Oops.
- What a fuzz-foot. You are so clumsy.

44:34.422 --> 44:36.798
- Catch, feather head.
- Thanks.

44:40.595 --> 44:44.848
- Well, time to go.
- Did we get everything?

44:45.016 --> 44:47.309
- The shorts.
- The shorts.

44:47.477 --> 44:49.436
In there?

44:49.604 --> 44:51.521
Okay, I'll check.

44:55.777 --> 44:57.819
I found the shorts.

45:02.075 --> 45:04.409
The pain.

45:04.786 --> 45:07.996
- I'm right behind you, pal.
- Uh, that's none too reassuring.

45:08.164 --> 45:10.582
Nice puppy. How's about a bone?

45:11.584 --> 45:14.836
- No dice.
- What about a nice holiday ham?

45:15.004 --> 45:17.964
- He ain't buying it. Can't we talk this over?
- Down, Beethoven.

45:18.132 --> 45:20.592
Ooh. The kids are here.

45:23.096 --> 45:25.389
Give it to me, Charles.

45:28.476 --> 45:30.852
- Here you go, Bugs.
- Thanks, kid.

45:31.145 --> 45:32.187
Shoo. Shoo.

45:33.564 --> 45:39.319
Bad dog. That is the last time
I'm ever working with dogs or children.

45:39.487 --> 45:41.780
- Bye-bye.
- Hey, where you going?

45:41.948 --> 45:45.492
Well, uh, you see, the Looney Tunes have
a big basketball game coming up...

45:45.660 --> 45:49.121
...and, uh, your dad's gonna play.
- All right.

45:49.288 --> 45:51.540
Yeah. But don't tell anybody.

46:08.349 --> 46:10.350
I see aliens.

46:10.518 --> 46:13.895
Little aliens from outer space.

46:14.063 --> 46:17.107
They forced their way inside your bodies.

46:17.275 --> 46:22.696
They need your talent
to win a basketball game against...

46:22.864 --> 46:24.739
...Bugs Bunny.
Bugs Bunny?

46:24.907 --> 46:31.163
I also see Michael Jordan
being sucked down a golf hole...

46:31.330 --> 46:32.831
...by furry creatures.

46:32.999 --> 46:36.209
- That's it. We're out of here.
- We're leaving now.

46:36.377 --> 46:39.421
- Let's try some acupuncture.
- Good idea. Bye.

46:39.714 --> 46:42.382
This is it. This is it.

46:42.550 --> 46:45.343
I don't know where you are, Michael,
but wherever you are...

46:45.511 --> 46:49.055
...you obviously enjoy being there
more than spending time with me.

46:49.223 --> 46:52.726
You better hope this Jordan character
still know how to play hoops.

46:52.894 --> 46:54.728
You and me both, brother.

46:54.896 --> 46:57.939
Listen, how is this for a new team name:

46:58.107 --> 47:00.525
- The Ducks.
Please.

47:00.693 --> 47:04.404
What kind of Mickey Mouse organization
would name their team the Ducks?

47:04.572 --> 47:07.407
So sue me. It's just a suggestion.

47:12.205 --> 47:13.580
You're doing it.

47:13.748 --> 47:14.915
You're becoming mighty.

47:15.082 --> 47:17.792
- Go!
Come on, guys. No pain, no gain.

47:17.960 --> 47:20.128
I don't hear it. What is it?

47:20.713 --> 47:22.881
Come on.
- Come on.

47:23.883 --> 47:26.384
- Eh, guys?
ALL: Yes?

47:26.552 --> 47:30.013
Look who's finally ready to play.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.522
Let's see if I remember how to do this.

47:45.571 --> 47:46.863
Nice.

48:09.804 --> 48:10.929
Michael!

48:13.224 --> 48:16.434
Is it really you? Oh!

48:16.602 --> 48:21.856
Thank God you're all right.
Oh! I was so worried.

48:22.024 --> 48:24.651
Come on, Stan. Don't hug me, please.

48:24.819 --> 48:26.278
- Sorry.
- What are you doing here?

48:26.445 --> 48:28.697
I gotta take you back.
You got baseball practice.

48:28.864 --> 48:32.450
I can't. I'm helping my friends
in their basketball game.

48:36.455 --> 48:39.249
Michael, you know that your friends
are cartoon characters?

48:40.793 --> 48:42.752
Yeah. So?

48:42.920 --> 48:47.424
Doesn't bother you, it doesn't bother me.
Let me help. Let me help. I can help.

48:47.592 --> 48:49.593
- What can you do?
- Well, you know, I mean...

48:49.760 --> 48:52.929
...I may not be very tall, but I'm slow.

48:53.097 --> 48:55.807
- And large.
- And a dork.

48:55.975 --> 48:58.059
I'll do anything, Michael. Anything.

48:58.227 --> 49:00.854
- Anything?
- Anything.

49:02.023 --> 49:04.774
Come here. Come here for a second.

49:05.359 --> 49:07.152
- Sit right here.
- Okay.

49:07.320 --> 49:09.112
- Okay?
- Okay. No problem.

49:09.280 --> 49:11.197
All right. All right, let's go, team.

49:13.034 --> 49:15.619
If somebody gets injured,
we could see a lot of minutes.

49:15.786 --> 49:18.538
I'm a cheerleader.

49:36.724 --> 49:39.601
Mr. Commissioner,
we've got the place sealed off.

49:39.935 --> 49:44.731
Quiet!
Ladies and gentlemen, please, quiet!

49:44.899 --> 49:48.485
Listen. After meeting with team owners,
I have decided...

49:48.653 --> 49:52.906
...that until we can guarantee the health
and safety of our NBA players...

49:53.074 --> 49:56.284
...there will be no more basketball
this season.

50:18.307 --> 50:19.349
Yes.

50:35.491 --> 50:38.076
Just get out of my way.

50:44.709 --> 50:46.292
- Ready?
Yes!

50:46.836 --> 50:48.128
Let's go.

50:54.051 --> 50:55.510
Are these the best seats?

50:55.678 --> 50:57.595
Like them. Yes.

50:57.763 --> 51:01.307
Can see everything from here.
Very good.

51:08.399 --> 51:11.943
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, yeah, sure, sure. Riot.

51:13.946 --> 51:17.157
Ladies and gentlemen...

51:17.324 --> 51:21.786
...the starting lineup for the Tune Squad.

51:23.873 --> 51:29.210
Standing 2-foot-4,
The Wonder From Down Under...

51:29.378 --> 51:32.797
...the Tazmanian Devil.

51:36.427 --> 51:42.307
At small forward,
standing a scintillating 3-foot-2...

51:42.475 --> 51:47.771
...The Heartthrob of the Hoops,
Lola Bunny.

51:50.649 --> 51:56.529
At power forward,
The Quackster of the Courts, Daffy Duck.

51:56.697 --> 51:58.615
Thank you. Thank you.

52:01.535 --> 52:05.205
Very funny. Let's all laugh at the duck.

52:05.372 --> 52:11.503
And at point guard, standing 3-foot-3,
4 feet if you include the ears...

52:11.670 --> 52:15.590
...co-captain of the Tune Squad...

52:15.758 --> 52:18.885
...The Doctor of Delight, Bugs Bunny.

52:19.053 --> 52:20.720
Thank you. Thank you.

52:23.265 --> 52:27.811
And now,
the player-coach of the Tune Squad...

52:28.437 --> 52:31.606
...at 6-foot-6, from North Carolina...

52:31.774 --> 52:38.363
...His Royal Airness, Michael Jordan.

52:41.575 --> 52:43.993
Who? Is he a Looney Tune?

52:44.161 --> 52:46.246
Uh... Uh, well, perhaps.

52:49.750 --> 52:52.293
- You guys ready?
- I'm set to take it to the rack, Jack.

52:52.461 --> 52:54.838
Those Monstars
will wish they'd never been born.

52:55.005 --> 52:57.841
- Guys, let's just go out and have fun.
Yeah!

52:58.008 --> 53:01.427
The challengers for the Ultimate Game...

53:01.595 --> 53:05.181
...all the way from Moron Mountain:

53:05.349 --> 53:11.145
The Monstars.

53:14.024 --> 53:16.901
Go Monstars! Go Monstars!
Go Monstars!

53:25.119 --> 53:27.287
What are you looking at?

53:34.962 --> 53:36.671
Cool shoes.

53:38.632 --> 53:40.216
Uh...

53:40.885 --> 53:42.302
Ready?

53:47.725 --> 53:50.143
I got it, I got it, I got it.
I got the ball. I got the ball.

53:50.311 --> 53:51.811
Yipe!

53:52.313 --> 53:53.354
Ooh.

53:58.944 --> 54:01.863
Way to go, boys.
Did you see the moves on that one?

54:02.656 --> 54:06.159
Come on, show me something.
Come on, show me something.

54:09.330 --> 54:11.080
- Whoops.
- The duck.

54:11.248 --> 54:13.458
Yeah, beat up on the duck.

54:18.672 --> 54:20.089
Oh, my.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.342
She was wide open.

54:33.228 --> 54:35.521
Watch it, coming your way.
Watch out, watch out.

54:36.857 --> 54:37.899
Get him.

54:42.863 --> 54:44.822
How did he do that?

54:46.116 --> 54:49.035
- Nice shot, Mr. J.
- Hey, hey, come on. Get back on defense.

54:50.829 --> 54:52.372
Way to go!

54:52.539 --> 54:53.790
Air J! Air J!

54:56.251 --> 54:57.293
Red light.

54:57.461 --> 55:01.381
- Feed me. Feed me.
- Feed you? Feed me.

55:04.885 --> 55:07.345
- Bad old putty tat.
I'll take that, thank you.

55:08.472 --> 55:11.057
Don't try this at home.

55:12.142 --> 55:14.310
I wish I was in the land of cott...

55:14.478 --> 55:16.145
You going somewhere?

55:16.313 --> 55:20.900
May I remind you, sir, that physical
violence is patently against the rules.

55:21.068 --> 55:26.614
Yeow! Did you order Original Recipe
or Extra Crispy?

55:30.327 --> 55:32.120
- Let's go.
- Me?

55:32.287 --> 55:35.665
- Oh, boy. I'm ready. I can do this.
- The mouse? You picked the mouse?

55:35.833 --> 55:38.126
- I love basketball. I always have. Do you?
- Uh-huh.

55:38.293 --> 55:40.420
- You're big. I bet you're good.
- Right.

55:40.587 --> 55:42.213
I'm small, but I'll try hard to be good.

55:42.381 --> 55:44.882
- Okay. Yeah.
- Really, I will. I always try hard.

55:45.050 --> 55:47.385
My mom says,
"Try your best at everything you do..."

55:47.553 --> 55:49.178
Oh!

55:50.639 --> 55:52.807
Try to get by me, doll.

55:52.975 --> 55:54.642
"Doll"?

55:59.314 --> 56:02.108
Don't ever call me "doll."

56:02.276 --> 56:03.943
- Nice shot.
- Thanks, Bugs.

56:04.111 --> 56:05.278
Hmm?

56:05.446 --> 56:08.406
Where's the defense, boy?
I got you right here.

56:09.241 --> 56:11.409
911.

56:11.577 --> 56:14.704
Piece of pie? Pork chop?
Some sorbet, perhaps?

56:31.221 --> 56:32.263
Half-time.

56:34.725 --> 56:36.100
Holy putty tat.

56:37.853 --> 56:40.229
Yeah, man, we got it going on.
One more half.

56:40.397 --> 56:42.106
Right, man. We got them.

56:42.274 --> 56:44.442
Moron Mountain, here we come.

56:44.610 --> 56:46.611
We're gonna be slaves.

56:46.779 --> 56:49.989
Come on, guys, keep your head up.
Got a whole other half to play.

57:03.962 --> 57:06.130
It's the boss.

57:06.298 --> 57:08.925
Hello, Mr. Swackhammer.

57:09.093 --> 57:10.593
All right.

57:10.761 --> 57:14.180
Not bad for the first half,
but we gotta keep this up.

57:14.348 --> 57:15.515
No problem. We stole...

57:15.682 --> 57:17.975
We stole talent from the best players
in the NBA.

57:18.143 --> 57:20.269
From the NBA.

57:22.147 --> 57:23.523
Shut up.

57:24.900 --> 57:26.859
I smell something.

57:28.362 --> 57:30.488
Uh, we have been playing really hard.

57:30.656 --> 57:32.990
- Yeah.
- Not you, you idiot.

57:35.119 --> 57:37.537
It's coming from over here.

57:37.704 --> 57:38.746
That locker.

57:41.959 --> 57:43.584
- Look.
- Aah!

57:43.752 --> 57:46.838
- It's the chubby boy.
- Ah.

57:47.005 --> 57:50.800
It smells like a spy.

57:53.262 --> 57:56.722
You guys need a publicist?
I can make you big. Ha, ha.

57:57.015 --> 57:59.142
- I know we're down.
Yeah. Let's hear the story.

57:59.309 --> 58:01.519
But I've been in this situation
many times before.

58:01.687 --> 58:05.022
We can still win this thing.
It's not over with. We gotta come together.

58:05.190 --> 58:07.233
We gotta believe in ourselves.
We can win this game.

58:07.401 --> 58:08.985
Yeah, right. That's gonna help us.

58:12.573 --> 58:15.741
Looks like Stan just had
a close encounter with a bug-zapper.

58:16.910 --> 58:19.954
Monstars. The Monstars.

58:23.834 --> 58:26.502
Ooh. That's gotta hurt.
- You all right, Stan?

58:26.670 --> 58:28.421
The Monst...

58:28.881 --> 58:33.134
The Monstars stole the talent
from the NBA players.

58:36.763 --> 58:38.764
So that's what happened to those guys.

58:38.932 --> 58:42.685
I think we should qui... Forfeit.

58:42.853 --> 58:44.729
ALL: Yeah.
- I didn't get dragged down here...

58:44.897 --> 58:47.607
...just to get my butt whipped
by a bunch of ugly Monstars.

58:47.774 --> 58:50.651
I ain't going out like that.
We're letting them push us around.

58:52.154 --> 58:55.948
We gotta fight them back. We gotta take it
to them. We gotta get right in their faces.

58:57.409 --> 58:59.118
What do you say?

58:59.703 --> 59:01.746
Are you with me or not?

59:07.127 --> 59:10.296
Finished? Great speech and all, doc.
You had them riveted.

59:10.464 --> 59:13.424
- But, uh, didn't you forget something?
- What?

59:14.134 --> 59:16.093
Your secret stuff.

59:23.685 --> 59:24.810
Wow.

59:25.145 --> 59:27.104
Whoa, nice deltoids.

59:27.272 --> 59:28.981
Play along.

59:30.234 --> 59:33.152
Uh, stop hogging it, Mike.
We're your teammates.

59:33.320 --> 59:35.988
Secret stuff?

59:36.156 --> 59:39.909
Secret stuff?
- You wouldn't hold out on us, would you?

59:40.077 --> 59:42.161
No, I mean,
I didn't think you guys really needed it.

59:42.329 --> 59:45.289
I mean, you're so tough.
You're competitive.

59:45.457 --> 59:49.502
We're also chicken, son. We need it bad.
- Hey.

59:49.670 --> 59:52.046
- Uh, I'd like some of that.
Could I have a sip, please?

59:52.214 --> 59:55.925
You know, this goes against everything
they taught me in health class.

59:56.677 --> 59:57.885
Do you want to win or not?

59:58.053 --> 1:00:00.054
Bottoms up.

1:00:01.890 --> 1:00:02.932
- Yummy.
- All right.

1:00:03.100 --> 1:00:05.851
How about we go out
and kick some alien butt, huh? Let's go.

1:00:06.019 --> 1:00:09.355
- How about it? Ready?
Yeah!

1:00:31.503 --> 1:00:33.212
Coming through.

1:00:35.382 --> 1:00:36.632
Bugs.

1:00:37.884 --> 1:00:38.926
Special delivery.

1:00:43.807 --> 1:00:44.849
Boo!

1:00:51.064 --> 1:00:54.191
Eh, nice kaboom, Wile E.

1:01:09.750 --> 1:01:12.126
Let's teach them a lesson.

1:01:17.257 --> 1:01:18.674
Nice butt.

1:01:27.142 --> 1:01:29.018
Going up.
You're mine, fool.

1:01:31.146 --> 1:01:32.646
Slammy.

1:01:34.649 --> 1:01:37.234
Hello.
A little surprise for you, my friends.

1:01:43.450 --> 1:01:44.617
Two points.

1:01:54.086 --> 1:01:56.754
Ooh. This will be good.

1:02:09.017 --> 1:02:10.726
- Okay, birdie.
- Uh-oh.

1:02:27.577 --> 1:02:29.578
Yes!
- Time out!

1:02:33.875 --> 1:02:36.585
Shut up, you little bug.
Get away from me. Powwow.

1:02:36.753 --> 1:02:40.506
All right. We're right back in this game.
Come on, now. Let's play tough defense.

1:02:40.674 --> 1:02:42.091
Why didn't you get this guy?

1:02:42.676 --> 1:02:45.636
He's a baseball player.
- Yeah, boss, a baseball player.

1:02:45.804 --> 1:02:48.222
Looks like a basketball player to me.

1:02:48.390 --> 1:02:50.141
Yeah, me too.

1:02:50.308 --> 1:02:53.853
- He's the one I want for Moron Mountain.
- Hey.

1:02:55.730 --> 1:02:57.773
Are you talking to me?

1:02:57.941 --> 1:03:01.152
Yeah, I'm talking to you.
You want a piece of me? Come and get it.

1:03:02.779 --> 1:03:04.155
Uh-oh.

1:03:05.073 --> 1:03:06.657
What did you have in mind?

1:03:07.909 --> 1:03:10.077
Hat about we raise the stakes
a little bit?

1:03:10.245 --> 1:03:11.704
Hmm.

1:03:12.122 --> 1:03:13.706
Interesting.

1:03:13.874 --> 1:03:17.001
If we win, you give the NBA
players their talent back.

1:03:17.169 --> 1:03:19.128
But what if we win?

1:03:20.547 --> 1:03:22.256
- If you win?
- Uh-huh.

1:03:22.883 --> 1:03:23.883
You get me.

1:03:24.050 --> 1:03:25.134
Good deal, boss.

1:03:25.635 --> 1:03:27.636
Doc, you think that's a good ide...?

1:03:30.974 --> 1:03:33.225
You'll be our star attraction.

1:03:34.561 --> 1:03:37.146
You'll sign autographs all day long.

1:03:38.565 --> 1:03:41.192
And play one-on-one
with the paying customers.

1:03:44.070 --> 1:03:46.822
And you'll always lose.

1:03:48.492 --> 1:03:50.743
Do we have a deal?

1:03:54.247 --> 1:03:55.915
Deal.

1:03:56.082 --> 1:03:57.124
All right.

1:04:01.963 --> 1:04:04.465
I don't think you should have
done that, doc.

1:04:04.633 --> 1:04:06.300
I have faith in my team.

1:04:08.345 --> 1:04:09.386
Crush them.

1:04:11.348 --> 1:04:13.098
Feeding time, boys.

1:04:20.398 --> 1:04:21.607
Goodbye.

1:04:29.115 --> 1:04:30.157
Fore.

1:04:35.956 --> 1:04:39.291
But, Mommy,
I don't want to go to school today.

1:04:40.377 --> 1:04:45.130
I want to stay home
and bake cookies with you.

1:04:47.425 --> 1:04:49.843
I'm open, I'm open.
- Lola, Lola, heads up.

1:04:50.345 --> 1:04:52.513
Oh!
Belly flop.

1:04:55.517 --> 1:04:57.059
Oh, my. Bugs!

1:04:57.936 --> 1:05:00.145
- Bugs!
- Is this your man?

1:05:01.982 --> 1:05:03.399
Are you okay?

1:05:03.567 --> 1:05:05.776
Me? Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

1:05:05.944 --> 1:05:07.611
Are you okay?

1:05:07.779 --> 1:05:09.989
Oh, Bugs. Thank you.

1:05:10.156 --> 1:05:11.907
Aw, it was nothing.

1:05:12.617 --> 1:05:16.662
That was the nicest thing anyone's
ever done for me.

1:05:21.126 --> 1:05:22.167
Time out.

1:05:25.839 --> 1:05:28.674
I could have been a contender.

1:05:28.842 --> 1:05:30.593
The Monstars. The Monstars.

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:33.470
I could have had a...
- Clear!

1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:49.695
Okay.

1:05:51.197 --> 1:05:54.033
- We need a fifth player.
- Hey, coach, listen.

1:05:54.200 --> 1:05:57.411
You got any more secret stuff?
I think it's starting to wear off.

1:05:57.579 --> 1:05:59.955
It didn't wear off. It was just water.

1:06:00.123 --> 1:06:02.833
You guys had the special stuff
inside of you all along.

1:06:03.668 --> 1:06:06.211
Yeah, yeah, I knew that.
But listen, you got any more?

1:06:06.463 --> 1:06:09.965
I'll take some.
Yeah, uh, can I have some too?

1:06:11.343 --> 1:06:12.718
- Stan?
- Me?

1:06:14.304 --> 1:06:16.013
You're in at center.

1:06:16.181 --> 1:06:17.556
Just guard the big guy, okay?

1:06:17.724 --> 1:06:20.059
Guard him? Guard him? I'll smother him.

1:06:20.226 --> 1:06:24.396
I'll be all over him like a cheap suit.
I'll be on him like stink on rice.

1:06:24.564 --> 1:06:25.856
I tell you, he's going down.

1:06:32.739 --> 1:06:35.741
Michael, over here. Over here.
Over here, I'm open.

1:06:44.459 --> 1:06:45.751
Yes!

1:06:47.796 --> 1:06:49.380
Ha, ha. Nice sho...!

1:06:49.547 --> 1:06:52.383
Big man pancake.

1:06:53.677 --> 1:06:54.843
Ooh.

1:06:57.555 --> 1:06:59.765
Let's get him out of here.

1:07:19.953 --> 1:07:21.704
Eew.

1:07:22.789 --> 1:07:24.248
Oh, my.

1:07:31.297 --> 1:07:32.506
How'd he do that?

1:07:32.674 --> 1:07:35.467
Aw, anybody could do that, doc.
Even you.

1:07:35.635 --> 1:07:37.803
Watch this.

1:07:38.179 --> 1:07:41.098
No sweat. This is Looney Tune Land.

1:07:44.644 --> 1:07:47.938
Ten seconds to go?
Thanks for telling me, doc.

1:07:48.106 --> 1:07:51.483
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
Your Airness...

1:07:51.651 --> 1:07:56.196
...but if you don't find a fifth player,
your team will forfeit the game.

1:07:56.364 --> 1:07:58.991
- Forfeit?
- Precisely, Sir Altitude.

1:07:59.367 --> 1:08:01.201
No way. We'll find someone.

1:08:06.249 --> 1:08:07.332
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:09.710
I didn't know Dan Aykroyd
was in this picture.

1:08:10.253 --> 1:08:11.670
Hey.

1:08:12.338 --> 1:08:14.923
Perhaps I could be of some assistance.

1:08:15.884 --> 1:08:17.676
That's our fifth guy.

1:08:17.844 --> 1:08:20.596
Thanks, Bill.
Now you get to live your dream. Let's go.

1:08:20.764 --> 1:08:22.556
- All right.
- All right.

1:08:22.724 --> 1:08:25.058
- We need to score two points...
- Here's how I see it.

1:08:25.226 --> 1:08:26.310
- Duck.
- Yes.

1:08:26.478 --> 1:08:29.354
- Kick it to the girl bunny down in the post.
Yeah?

1:08:29.522 --> 1:08:31.523
- You dish it back to the guy bunny.
- Got it.

1:08:31.691 --> 1:08:34.193
- You swing it to Mike. You go to the hole.
- Bill.

1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:36.361
- And dominate.
- We're on defense.

1:08:36.529 --> 1:08:39.948
- Oh, yeah.
- Whoa. I don't play defense.

1:08:40.116 --> 1:08:42.326
- Typical.
- Gonna have to listen to Mike on this.

1:08:42.494 --> 1:08:47.164
Okay. Somebody steal the ball, get it to me
and I'll score before the time runs out.

1:08:47.999 --> 1:08:49.833
Don't lose that confidence. Okay.

1:08:50.001 --> 1:08:52.544
- Paws and wings in here. Okay.
Yes!

1:08:58.593 --> 1:09:00.594
This is why I was born.

1:09:00.762 --> 1:09:02.596
I thrive on pressure.

1:09:02.764 --> 1:09:06.308
- Excuse me, uh, sorry.
- Yo, yo, easy on the trousers, Daf. Easy.

1:09:06.476 --> 1:09:09.895
Pardon me. Mr. Murray,
something's really been bugging me.

1:09:10.063 --> 1:09:12.815
- Yeah?
- Just how did you get here anyway?

1:09:14.234 --> 1:09:17.277
Producer's a friend of mine.
Just had a teamster come and drop me off.

1:09:17.445 --> 1:09:19.071
Uh-huh.

1:09:19.239 --> 1:09:20.405
Well, that's how it goes.

1:09:21.157 --> 1:09:23.659
Hey, you see this, uh, kind of chunky
fellow over here?

1:09:25.411 --> 1:09:26.870
Uh-huh.

1:09:29.123 --> 1:09:32.543
- Oh. Oh, that's good. Oh, yes.
- Let's do it. You the duck.

1:09:32.794 --> 1:09:35.712
Now, let's all play fair. Here.

1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:37.798
Yo, spaceman. Don't choke now.
Come on.

1:09:37.966 --> 1:09:40.133
It's gut-check time.

1:09:43.888 --> 1:09:46.223
This must be mine. Woo-hoo!

1:09:46.391 --> 1:09:49.518
This belongs to me.
I'm going this way. I'm going left.

1:09:49.686 --> 1:09:52.312
Whoa! Don't ever trust an Earthling.

1:09:55.483 --> 1:09:56.525
Mike!

1:09:57.694 --> 1:10:00.112
Get the rabbit. Get the girl.

1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:01.822
Come on, come on. I'm open.

1:10:02.448 --> 1:10:03.448
I'm op...!

1:10:04.075 --> 1:10:05.909
- That's mine.
- Not today.

1:10:06.411 --> 1:10:08.871
Hey.
Bring it on, dude.

1:10:09.038 --> 1:10:11.456
BILL:
Whoopsie-daisy.

1:10:12.584 --> 1:10:14.251
You're mine.

1:10:22.677 --> 1:10:24.011
Mike, I'm open!

1:10:26.431 --> 1:10:27.598
Never mind.

1:11:02.926 --> 1:11:04.718
The Tunes win!

1:11:10.099 --> 1:11:11.308
That was a nice pass, man.

1:11:11.476 --> 1:11:13.602
That was a great stretch
for the basket too.

1:11:13.770 --> 1:11:17.522
You know, you really got some skills.
You might be able to play in the NBA.

1:11:18.232 --> 1:11:20.943
Thanks, Mike.
I'll probably quote you on that.

1:11:21.110 --> 1:11:24.196
But I'm gonna take this opportunity
to retire from the game.

1:11:24.364 --> 1:11:25.989
- No, come on.
- No.

1:11:26.157 --> 1:11:28.408
No, I'm gonna retire right now.
That's all there is to it.

1:11:28.576 --> 1:11:31.203
I'm gonna go out on top,
undefeated and untied.

1:11:31.371 --> 1:11:32.788
That's the way it's gonna be.

1:11:32.956 --> 1:11:35.457
- You go celebrate with your team.
- Come help us, man.

1:11:35.625 --> 1:11:40.462
I'd like to, but I have to ice down my knees
right away, okay? They're starting to go.

1:11:40.630 --> 1:11:43.340
- All right. Goodbye, man.
- All right, see you.

1:11:44.884 --> 1:11:48.553
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Definitely sure. Definitely.

1:11:49.514 --> 1:11:51.014
- Losers.
Sorry.

1:11:51.182 --> 1:11:52.808
- Choke artists.
- Sorry again.

1:11:52.976 --> 1:11:55.852
Wait till I get you back
on Moron Mountain.

1:11:57.230 --> 1:12:00.482
All right. The party's over.
Get in the spaceship.

1:12:00.650 --> 1:12:02.234
Why do you take it from this guy?

1:12:02.402 --> 1:12:04.736
Because he's bigger.

1:12:04.904 --> 1:12:06.196
He's bigger?

1:12:06.364 --> 1:12:08.907
Than we used to be.

1:12:10.243 --> 1:12:11.660
What are you doing?

1:12:12.620 --> 1:12:15.205
- Wait. What are you doing? Wait.
Come here.

1:12:31.305 --> 1:12:33.306
Had it in you all the time, didn't you?

1:12:35.435 --> 1:12:38.186
One thing, though.
Pass me the ball, Bugs.

1:12:38.354 --> 1:12:40.105
You gotta give my friends
their talent back.

1:12:40.940 --> 1:12:42.816
Do we have to?

1:12:42.984 --> 1:12:45.569
Yeah, it's part of the deal.
Touch the ball.

1:12:47.447 --> 1:12:49.740
Oh, okay.

1:12:49.907 --> 1:12:52.743
Fair is fair.
- There you go. Touch it.

1:12:59.792 --> 1:13:01.460
That was so much fun.

1:13:01.627 --> 1:13:04.212
I feel so insignificant.

1:13:04.380 --> 1:13:06.131
My clothes don't fit.

1:13:06.299 --> 1:13:08.717
- What a trip.
- Ha, ha. I'm up for another one.

1:13:08.885 --> 1:13:11.386
Can we ask you a favor, Mr. Bunny?

1:13:11.554 --> 1:13:13.722
We don't want to go back
to Moron Mountain.

1:13:13.890 --> 1:13:16.933
- We hate it up there.
- It stinks.

1:13:17.101 --> 1:13:20.228
Um, I was thinking,
could we stay here with you?

1:13:20.396 --> 1:13:22.064
Please.

1:13:22.231 --> 1:13:23.690
Oh, brother.

1:13:23.858 --> 1:13:26.234
Eh, I don't know if you guys
are looney enough.

1:13:26.402 --> 1:13:27.819
Looney enough?

1:13:34.952 --> 1:13:36.703
Michael, do you know what time it is?

1:13:36.871 --> 1:13:40.123
Seven-fift... Seven-fift... Quarter past 7.

1:13:40.291 --> 1:13:43.001
Exactly. You've got a baseball game
in five minutes.

1:13:43.169 --> 1:13:45.045
Okay. Take this.

1:13:46.172 --> 1:13:48.799
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, put it in my bag.

1:13:48.966 --> 1:13:51.384
Okay. Let's go.

1:13:51.552 --> 1:13:53.428
I really enjoyed playing with you guys.

1:13:53.596 --> 1:13:55.180
You guys got a lot of, uh...

1:13:56.349 --> 1:13:57.891
- A lot of, uh...
Yes?

1:13:58.059 --> 1:14:00.227
Well, whatever it is, you got a lot of it.

1:14:02.939 --> 1:14:04.856
All right. Gotta go.

1:14:05.399 --> 1:14:07.025
- Bugs.
- Eh, Mike.

1:14:07.193 --> 1:14:10.737
- Stay out of trouble.
- You know I will.

1:14:10.905 --> 1:14:12.697
Come here.

1:14:14.700 --> 1:14:16.201
Woo-hoo!

1:14:16.577 --> 1:14:19.121
We want Michael! We want Michael!

1:14:19.789 --> 1:14:23.083
The delay is killing us. Where's Michael?

1:14:23.251 --> 1:14:24.876
Where is Michael?

1:14:25.044 --> 1:14:27.045
Oh, he's not back from his other game.

1:14:27.213 --> 1:14:29.005
- What other game?
- Shh.

1:14:29.715 --> 1:14:31.091
Uh-uh. What other game?

1:15:05.251 --> 1:15:07.460
Ladies and gentlemen...

1:15:10.423 --> 1:15:12.132
...Michael Jordan.

1:15:29.734 --> 1:15:32.569
Guys, we suck.

1:15:32.737 --> 1:15:35.363
Yeah, man.
My grandmother plays better than I do.

1:15:35.531 --> 1:15:39.242
At least you guys are still tall.
I'm nothing now. Just another short guy.

1:15:39.410 --> 1:15:42.787
- You got that right.
- That's the only thing you got right.

1:15:46.292 --> 1:15:47.375
- Who's that?
- Who's that?

1:15:47.543 --> 1:15:50.212
I don't know.
- Been getting your butts kicked?

1:15:50.379 --> 1:15:51.630
Who's that?
- It's Mike.

1:15:51.797 --> 1:15:53.131
- What's up?
- Why are you here?

1:15:53.299 --> 1:15:56.801
Don't be embarrassed. Just face it.

1:15:56.969 --> 1:15:57.969
You guys stink.

1:15:58.137 --> 1:16:00.931
- Come on, Mike. Lighten up.
- I know, man.

1:16:01.098 --> 1:16:04.100
You want your games back, huh?
What little games you had to begin with.

1:16:04.518 --> 1:16:07.103
- It's hard enough as it is, Mike.
- Give us a break.

1:16:08.064 --> 1:16:09.856
I'm gonna regret this.

1:16:11.108 --> 1:16:12.984
Stan, give me the ball.

1:16:15.488 --> 1:16:16.905
Oh.

1:16:17.281 --> 1:16:18.865
Look at that.

1:16:19.033 --> 1:16:21.159
Looks like something from Star Trek.

1:16:22.161 --> 1:16:25.121
- Touch it.
- No way, Jose.

1:16:25.289 --> 1:16:28.917
Pat, you want your talent back?
You don't have any choice. Just touch it.

1:16:29.794 --> 1:16:31.419
- I don't know.
- Don't touch it.

1:16:31.587 --> 1:16:34.798
You're gonna walk around with a bad game
for the rest of your career.

1:16:34.966 --> 1:16:36.633
Touch the ball.

1:16:37.426 --> 1:16:39.386
Careful, Pat.

1:16:41.138 --> 1:16:42.597
We've tried everything else.

1:16:53.859 --> 1:16:56.695
Come on, Charles. Touch it.

1:16:56.862 --> 1:16:59.447
The rest of you guys. Just touch it.

1:17:05.579 --> 1:17:08.164
- What was that?
- I liked that, Mike.

1:17:08.332 --> 1:17:10.250
Hey, I caught it.

1:17:10.710 --> 1:17:13.128
Look at Muggsy handle the rock.
Handle it, baby.

1:17:13.296 --> 1:17:16.423
- I can handle that rock again.
That's the old Muggs I know.

1:17:16.590 --> 1:17:18.758
Yeah, get height now.

1:17:19.010 --> 1:17:21.219
It gave me my powers back.

1:17:21.387 --> 1:17:24.055
That wasn't bad.
Let me show you something.

1:17:25.474 --> 1:17:28.351
- The Round Mound is back.
- Want to see something?

1:17:30.062 --> 1:17:32.897
Oh, man. That felt good.

1:17:35.151 --> 1:17:37.027
I got it.
You got it. Yeah, baby.

1:17:37.194 --> 1:17:41.114
Hey, Michael. Why don't you stay,
play some three-on-three with us?

1:17:41.282 --> 1:17:43.616
No, I don't think so.

1:17:43.784 --> 1:17:45.744
You gonna work on that baseball swing?

1:17:45.911 --> 1:17:49.914
Leave the baseball player alone.
He doesn't play basketball anymore.

1:17:50.082 --> 1:17:52.250
He probably doesn't even
have it anymore, guys.

1:17:52.418 --> 1:17:54.210
Michael, do you hear them?

1:17:54.378 --> 1:17:57.213
They don't think
you can play the game anymore.

1:18:00.801 --> 1:18:02.510
There's only one way to find out.

1:18:06.932 --> 1:18:10.268
The Chicago Bulls welcome back...

1:18:10.436 --> 1:18:15.523
...Michael Jordan!

1:18:27.078 --> 1:18:29.287
What's the matter, Bill?

1:18:31.374 --> 1:18:33.583
Larry, that could have been me.

1:18:33.751 --> 1:18:38.630
Will you get off that kick?
It's over. It's done with. You can't play.

1:18:41.675 --> 1:18:43.134
Okay.

1:18:44.053 --> 1:18:46.429
Let's go, Bulls.

1:26:54.334 --> 1:26:56.627
Well, that's all, folks.

1:26:56.795 --> 1:26:59.005
That's my line.

1:26:59.172 --> 1:27:02.300
Step aside, babe. Let a star do this.

1:27:02.467 --> 1:27:03.968
That's all...

1:27:04.136 --> 1:27:06.637
That's all, folks.

1:27:07.639 --> 1:27:09.807
Can I go home now?
