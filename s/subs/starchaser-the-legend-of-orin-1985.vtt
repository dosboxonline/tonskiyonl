01:51.945 --> 01:54.857
- Get up and dig, worm!

02:04.750 --> 02:06.741
- You've got to slow down, grandfather.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.834
You're too old to keep up this pace.

02:09.838 --> 02:13.626
- I've been digging for 70 years, elan.

02:13.634 --> 02:17.172
Slowing down will only
prolong my suffering.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.632
- Orin, don't.

02:19.640 --> 02:23.007
You won't survive doing the work of two.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.679
- For the prettiest girl in the world,

02:24.686 --> 02:25.971
I'd do the work of 10.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.310
- No talking!

02:27.314 --> 02:28.895
The gods forbid it.

02:32.194 --> 02:33.434
- Water, water!

02:35.280 --> 02:36.360
Water, water!

02:37.866 --> 02:38.866
Water!

02:58.178 --> 02:59.714
- Leave him be.

02:59.721 --> 03:01.882
He's no use to anyone now.

03:23.453 --> 03:24.863
- Orin!

03:24.871 --> 03:25.871
Orin!

03:29.793 --> 03:32.535
- Zygon, zygon!

03:38.719 --> 03:40.505
- Zygon!
- Zygon!

03:58.155 --> 04:00.111
- On your knees!

04:06.621 --> 04:11.160
- The gods of
the mineworld are angry.

04:11.168 --> 04:15.537
They have kept you alive
since the beginning of time

04:16.505 --> 04:20.214
and ask very little in return.

04:20.218 --> 04:24.632
The furnace of life cries out in hunger.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.882
You must feed more crystals,

04:28.894 --> 04:33.854
or its life-giving energy
will burn out forever.

04:34.566 --> 04:38.058
So dig harder or die!

05:15.816 --> 05:19.308
- Pick up your gifts and get back to work.

05:24.866 --> 05:26.356
- Stop that!

05:27.619 --> 05:28.699
- Stop!

05:51.601 --> 05:53.887
- What is it, Orin?

05:53.895 --> 05:55.385
- Oh, my god!

05:55.397 --> 05:56.512
- What's wrong, hopps?

05:57.524 --> 06:00.357
- I thought it was only a myth, but...

06:00.360 --> 06:03.397
- Remember what the mine masters say.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.771
We're supposed to give them any.

06:05.782 --> 06:06.862
- Not a word!

06:06.867 --> 06:08.323
They must not get this!

06:08.326 --> 06:09.326
- But what is it?

06:10.787 --> 06:11.787
- Hide it!

06:15.667 --> 06:17.282
- Why aren't you working?

06:17.294 --> 06:19.285
- No, no, no, no!

06:19.296 --> 06:23.209
My eyes!

06:24.175 --> 06:25.585
- Madman.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.131
- The sword, the sword!

06:31.349 --> 06:32.429
Up, up there.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.341
- Grandfather!

06:35.353 --> 06:36.353
Why?

06:38.481 --> 06:39.481
He's gone!

06:40.567 --> 06:42.853
I have no one now!

06:42.861 --> 06:44.021
- You have me.

06:45.572 --> 06:48.188
- He died for no reason, Orin.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.030
- No, elan.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.526
Hopps sacrificed his life for us.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.902
- But why?

06:53.914 --> 06:54.778
- I don't know.

06:54.789 --> 06:56.575
But whatever hopps was trying to tell us

06:56.583 --> 06:58.574
had something to do with this.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.559
- It's alive!

07:16.561 --> 07:19.394
- If, in the distant future,

07:20.440 --> 07:22.852
someone hears these words,

07:23.818 --> 07:26.525
perhaps it is not too late.

07:26.529 --> 07:30.317
These dark corridors
are not your true home.

07:31.242 --> 07:36.077
There is a world above,
a magnificent universe

07:36.081 --> 07:40.290
to which you can return,
if you have the courage.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.669
He who possesses this sword,

07:44.673 --> 07:46.629
possesses the power of truth.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.966
Find the blade,

07:49.970 --> 07:52.427
and you will find your freedom.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.431
- He's gone!

07:57.435 --> 07:58.925
- A world above?

07:58.937 --> 07:59.972
- I don't know.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.390
Freedom?

08:01.398 --> 08:03.354
- Lies, all lies!

08:03.358 --> 08:04.564
- But why would anyone lie

08:04.567 --> 08:06.182
about an upper world, raymo?

08:07.362 --> 08:09.193
- By believing the words of that demon,

08:09.197 --> 08:11.153
you spit on the most sacred

08:11.157 --> 08:14.365
commandment, never dig up.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.530
Up is hell.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.278
- What if the commandments are wrong?

08:18.289 --> 08:20.780
What if there is a world beyond our own?

08:20.792 --> 08:21.907
By not trying to find it,

08:21.918 --> 08:23.203
we could spend the rest of eternity

08:23.211 --> 08:25.327
digging and dying when there

08:25.338 --> 08:27.203
when there may be something else.

08:27.215 --> 08:29.001
- What else could there be?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.124
- I don't know.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.751
But on my grandfather's grave I swear,

08:33.804 --> 08:37.548
if there's a world above, I will find it.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.053
Who's with me?

08:40.061 --> 08:42.097
- No one's going with you.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.471
I'm turning you both
in to the mine masters

08:44.482 --> 08:46.438
for speaking out against the gods.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.150
Now, give me that evil thing!

09:00.915 --> 09:01.915
- Orin?

09:03.585 --> 09:05.450
- I'm all right, Kallie.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.827
- If raymo tells the mine masters,

09:06.838 --> 09:08.453
you will be killed, Orin.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.626
- In that case, I might as well die

09:10.633 --> 09:12.294
trying to find the upper world.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.461
We'll go together, elan.

09:15.472 --> 09:16.837
- I'll go with you, too.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.681
- You'll have to be with
us in spirit, Kallie.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.596
- It's too dangerous
for one as young as you.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.265
- I'm not too young.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.558
You don't want me because I can't see.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.599
Don't leave me, Orin.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.646
I'll die without you.

09:31.821 --> 09:32.901
- You'll do just fine.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.735
Aunt Bella will look after you.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.617
- But what if you,

09:39.621 --> 09:41.452
what if you don't come back?

09:41.456 --> 09:43.162
- I'll come back, Kallie.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.334
I promise.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.914
I love you, little digger.

10:19.160 --> 10:21.651
- Hey, you there, back to work!

10:25.750 --> 10:26.750
- Orin?

10:27.544 --> 10:28.544
Elan?

10:29.546 --> 10:30.546
Orin?

10:31.923 --> 10:36.917
Orin?

10:40.515 --> 10:42.801
- It's all right, Kallie, we're here.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.300
- You almost got yourself
killed, you little fool.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.051
- You forgot the food!

10:47.063 --> 10:48.052
- Hey, you worm!

10:48.064 --> 10:49.975
Why aren't you working?

10:51.568 --> 10:52.398
- Quick!

10:52.402 --> 10:53.983
Get in the ore cart, hurry!

10:53.987 --> 10:55.022
- After them!

11:12.213 --> 11:13.794
- Run, Kallie, run!

11:20.847 --> 11:23.179
- Stop, worms, stop!

11:33.943 --> 11:35.433
- Jump now!

11:38.198 --> 11:39.358
- Orin!

12:03.640 --> 12:05.972
- Quick, under the crystals!

12:28.164 --> 12:30.371
- Engine systems crew.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.287
All processing robots
to unloading bay two.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.159
All processing robots to unloading.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.036
- Where are we?

12:37.048 --> 12:38.288
- I don't know.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.186
No, no, keep going!

13:02.865 --> 13:03.695
- Zygon!

13:03.700 --> 13:05.361
- My congratulations.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.734
You now know what only one other slave

13:07.745 --> 13:10.737
has known in the last 1,200 years.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.990
And like him, you will
die with the secret.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.459
You might as well know
the rest of the lie.

13:16.462 --> 13:20.250
Behold the great god of mineworld!

13:25.513 --> 13:26.513
- No!

13:28.182 --> 13:29.182
Stop!

13:36.649 --> 13:37.649
No.

13:40.278 --> 13:42.769
- The sword with no blade!

13:42.780 --> 13:43.895
Where did you get this?

13:45.616 --> 13:47.948
I'm afraid it won't be
of any use to you now.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.500
Watch out for the crystals!

14:17.648 --> 14:19.855
- If there is a world above,

14:19.859 --> 14:22.100
I'll find it for you, elan.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.696
- Never mind me.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.700
Kill the boy!

14:47.804 --> 14:50.796
A fitting grave for a slave of trinia.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.693
- Never dig up.

15:05.780 --> 15:06.780
Up is hell.

16:43.920 --> 16:44.750
What have you got to tell me

16:44.754 --> 16:46.290
this time, old man?

16:47.340 --> 16:49.046
Is this your magnificent universe?

17:21.374 --> 17:22.614
It's not a lie!

17:23.501 --> 17:24.741
It's not a lie!

18:13.593 --> 18:14.593
- A human.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.889
- I want his hair.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.348
- Ow, let go!

18:23.352 --> 18:24.512
- I get his arm.

18:24.520 --> 18:29.230
- Get your claws off him,
you greedy swamp scum.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.189
Maybe the fleshy boy doesn't want

18:31.193 --> 18:33.354
to give up his body parts.

18:34.238 --> 18:35.148
Do you?

18:35.156 --> 18:36.441
- No.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.941
- Well, that's just too bad.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.908
Because we're going to take them anyway.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.747
- I'm sorry I escaped.

18:54.759 --> 18:56.249
I'll go back!

18:56.260 --> 18:57.249
- Shut up, human.

18:57.261 --> 19:00.845
Your brain must have worms eating it.

19:03.017 --> 19:04.177
It makes no sense.

19:04.185 --> 19:07.052
- Careful, you're bruising his arm.

19:09.523 --> 19:10.603
This is mine!

19:11.984 --> 19:13.064
- Mine, mine!

19:16.781 --> 19:21.445
- You'll get what I give you.

19:21.452 --> 19:26.446
Now who wants his teeth?

19:30.294 --> 19:32.250
- Gold jewels!

19:32.254 --> 19:33.710
- Give me that!

19:33.714 --> 19:35.750
- No, I found it!

19:36.676 --> 19:38.166
- Let me see.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.589
- It's mine, it's mine!

19:40.596 --> 19:44.259
- Let me have it, or
I'll cut your hump off!

20:15.256 --> 20:16.256
- Ahk?

20:22.930 --> 20:24.045
You!

20:24.056 --> 20:25.512
You're doing this!

20:25.516 --> 20:27.632
This is human magic.

20:27.643 --> 20:28.803
- No, I didn't!

20:30.396 --> 20:32.887
Yes, you're right.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.559
It is human magic.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.058
I can kill you the same
as I killed the other two.

20:39.697 --> 20:41.062
Stop!

20:41.073 --> 20:42.438
Bring me the magic object.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.157
Have it your way.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.780
How do you want to die?

20:52.126 --> 20:55.539
- I bring, I bring!

20:57.256 --> 20:58.462
- Good.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.422
Now wave it just beyond my right hand.

21:24.492 --> 21:27.029
- He's killed everyone.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.651
He's dangerous.

21:28.662 --> 21:29.662
- Dangerous?

21:31.165 --> 21:32.746
I'll wear his feet!

22:03.739 --> 22:04.945
- You've got exactly 10 seconds

22:04.949 --> 22:07.861
to tell me what you're
doing in this swamp,

22:07.868 --> 22:10.234
or you'll be swimming
with those two mandroids.

22:16.001 --> 22:18.583
What in the hell are you doing?

22:27.721 --> 22:29.211
Now start talking.

22:29.223 --> 22:32.386
- I came from mine.

22:33.853 --> 22:34.808
- Damn!

22:34.812 --> 22:36.643
I knew you were a smuggler.

22:36.647 --> 22:37.762
Where's your ship?

22:37.773 --> 22:39.138
Ship?

22:39.149 --> 22:41.060
Don't play dumb with me.

22:41.068 --> 22:43.184
Nobody takes crystals out on foot.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.480
- Crystals?

22:44.488 --> 22:46.194
You know of the mineworld?

22:46.198 --> 22:47.028
- The what?

22:47.032 --> 22:48.863
- The world where I came from,

22:48.868 --> 22:50.324
where we mine the crystals.

22:50.327 --> 22:51.612
- Who mines the crystals?

22:51.620 --> 22:53.326
- We all do.

22:53.330 --> 22:55.036
At least, I did until I came up here.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.782
- Your tongue moves faster
than a water snake's, kid.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.658
Everyone from here to the glass nebula

22:59.670 --> 23:01.160
knows that robots have done

23:01.171 --> 23:04.038
all the mining for the
last thousand years.

23:04.049 --> 23:04.913
- What's a robot?

23:04.925 --> 23:05.925
- Cut the crap!

23:07.261 --> 23:08.751
Now I want the truth.

23:08.762 --> 23:09.922
And fast.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.921
- How in the hell did you...

23:45.925 --> 23:47.415
- I'm not sure.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.213
Yeah, well, thanks anyway.

23:50.220 --> 23:52.302
Now beat it, kid, I've got work to do.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.892
- Please, I need your help!

23:58.896 --> 24:01.103
I promised Kallie I'd come back for him.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.347
- Listen, water snake, I saved you,

24:03.359 --> 24:05.475
you saved me, we're even.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.272
Now beat it!

24:07.279 --> 24:09.440
- I beg your pardon?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.188
- I wasn't talking to you, Arthur.

24:12.076 --> 24:13.407
- Oh.

24:25.339 --> 24:27.204
- They pumped up security.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.956
Any sign of that patrol ship yet?

24:30.344 --> 24:31.925
Arthur?

24:31.929 --> 24:32.918
- Are you talking to me?

24:32.930 --> 24:36.297
- Well, who the hell
do you think I'm talking to?

24:36.308 --> 24:38.219
- Well, why don't
you make up your mind?

24:38.227 --> 24:39.763
Don't worry about the patrol.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.852
I'll let you know as soon as I spot it.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.484
Get away from me!

24:47.486 --> 24:49.192
Damn starfly!

24:49.196 --> 24:51.061
Hey, get out of here!

24:55.411 --> 24:56.411
Whoa!

25:04.003 --> 25:05.584
- What are they?

25:05.587 --> 25:07.418
- They're pests, like you.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.103
- Dagg?

25:28.610 --> 25:29.440
-What is it?

25:29.445 --> 25:30.480
- The pyramid patrol ship

25:30.487 --> 25:34.150
will be at your present
location in about 32.9 seconds.

25:34.158 --> 25:35.022
- 30 seconds?

25:35.034 --> 25:37.320
Why the hell didn't you warn me sooner?

25:37.327 --> 25:40.410
- I tried, but
something was fouling my signal.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.120
- Come on, there's a patrol coming!

25:42.124 --> 25:43.705
- What's a patrol?

25:43.709 --> 25:46.371
- Damn!

25:51.967 --> 25:54.083
Well, don't just sit there, Arthur!

25:54.094 --> 25:55.834
Blast those bastards!

26:05.147 --> 26:06.808
- "Keep the
shields down," he says.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.851
There won't be any shooting.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.979
- He's not anywhere,
he's the ship's computer.

26:11.987 --> 26:12.817
- I wish you'd stop

26:12.821 --> 26:14.061
calling me a computer, dagg.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.062
It's so impersonal!

26:15.074 --> 26:16.985
After all, your body's just a machine

26:16.992 --> 26:18.198
made of flesh and blood.

26:18.202 --> 26:19.408
How would you like it if I went around

26:19.411 --> 26:20.821
calling you meat brain?

26:20.829 --> 26:21.909
- Strap yourself in.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.123
Suit yourself.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.825
Take us out of here, Arthur.

26:28.962 --> 26:31.078
- You could say please, you know.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.978
- What is that?

26:51.985 --> 26:53.475
- That, my little water snake,

26:53.487 --> 26:56.103
is where I'm about to do my business.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.481
The largest rubidimite shipping complex

26:58.492 --> 26:59.652
on planet trinia.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.693
What the hell did we hit?

27:02.704 --> 27:05.241
- Just the base security shield.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.410
- Damn, I never fly low enough.

27:14.424 --> 27:15.960
- Riding in eastern base.

27:15.968 --> 27:19.210
Level 9, prepare for tractor b boarding.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.221
- Sir.

27:21.223 --> 27:22.679
We've got a low altitude unscheduled

27:22.683 --> 27:24.219
entry coming in from the swamp.

27:25.102 --> 27:26.763
- Sounds like mandroids.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.102
They're probably running
out of body parts.

27:29.106 --> 27:31.267
The gunners will enjoy
the target practice.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.523
General alert.

27:34.820 --> 27:39.814
All stations prepare for
minimal low level attack.

27:45.789 --> 27:46.653
- Sighting frequencies

27:46.665 --> 27:48.155
are locking on to us, dagg.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.624
I hope you've got a good plan this time.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.834
- Give 'em a light show, Arthur.

27:52.838 --> 27:53.873
- Not that again!

27:53.881 --> 27:55.917
The last time we tried decoy laser fire,

27:55.924 --> 27:58.006
I got my aft panels vaporized!

27:58.010 --> 27:59.420
- Arthur!

28:06.894 --> 28:07.894
Heads up, kid.

28:19.907 --> 28:20.942
- Ow!

28:20.949 --> 28:22.610
I told you it wouldn't work.

28:22.618 --> 28:23.607
- What's happening?

28:23.619 --> 28:25.200
- Just a little welcoming fire.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.204
Hang on.

29:05.994 --> 29:07.655
Oh, great!

29:07.663 --> 29:08.527
They've got an atomic watchdog

29:08.538 --> 29:10.028
sitting right on the doorstep.

29:11.375 --> 29:12.205
Damn!

29:12.209 --> 29:15.918
We need more muscle!

29:19.132 --> 29:20.997
I've got to find a way to knock it out.

29:22.135 --> 29:27.129
And there it is.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.909
- Touche!

29:52.916 --> 29:53.746
- Stow it, Arthur.

29:53.750 --> 29:55.741
We're not home free yet.

30:06.096 --> 30:08.007
- Blasted security section!

30:08.015 --> 30:09.346
Why don't they ever tell anybody

30:09.349 --> 30:11.305
about their damn drills!

30:11.310 --> 30:12.390
- Keep an eye on the kid, Arthur.

30:12.394 --> 30:14.510
Don't let him out of your sight.

30:14.521 --> 30:16.603
- I'm not a babysitter, you know.

30:19.067 --> 30:19.897
- Okay, guys.

30:19.901 --> 30:21.232
Just the way we practiced it.

30:21.236 --> 30:22.726
Number one, you lead.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.774
- Excuse me, sir, I'm number three.

30:24.781 --> 30:25.611
He's one.

30:25.615 --> 30:26.445
- Never mind!

30:26.450 --> 30:27.450
Let's move it!

30:58.023 --> 30:59.103
Hit the deck!

31:14.498 --> 31:15.328
Damn!

31:15.332 --> 31:16.947
They've strengthened the access doors.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.164
You got any bright ideas

31:18.168 --> 31:19.453
how we can get through that door?

31:19.461 --> 31:20.291
- Sorry, sir.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.786
I'm programmed for
tactical, not engineering.

31:22.798 --> 31:24.629
- Bargain robots, damn!

31:29.971 --> 31:31.131
Arthur!

31:31.139 --> 31:32.470
Get off your butt and fly underneath

31:32.474 --> 31:34.339
that marcabian transport ship.

31:34.351 --> 31:35.466
And no back talk!

31:42.150 --> 31:42.980
That's good.

31:42.984 --> 31:44.815
Now open the upper cargo doors.

31:47.447 --> 31:48.447
This better work.

31:59.543 --> 32:02.205
- Move, and you're dead.

32:14.224 --> 32:15.714
- Zygon!

32:15.725 --> 32:16.714
Arthur.

32:16.726 --> 32:17.556
- Yes?

32:17.561 --> 32:18.676
- Take us down.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.097
- I'm afraid
that won't be possible.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.346
You see, I'm programmed
to respond only to.

32:24.109 --> 32:26.145
- I said take us down!

32:26.153 --> 32:27.393
- Consider it done.

32:37.914 --> 32:40.872
- The penalty for rubidimite
smuggling is death.

32:42.586 --> 32:43.586
You!

32:44.963 --> 32:46.419
- Kid, no!

32:56.141 --> 32:58.598
We've got to get back
to the ship if we can!

32:58.602 --> 33:00.513
- No, I'll kill him first!

33:00.520 --> 33:01.851
- Get down, kid!

33:07.068 --> 33:09.650
- Who the hell ordered this drill?

33:09.654 --> 33:10.484
Hey!

33:10.489 --> 33:11.319
- Come on, kid!

33:11.323 --> 33:13.564
This is our ticket out of here.

33:13.575 --> 33:14.530
Let me go!

33:14.534 --> 33:15.534
Let me go!

33:18.330 --> 33:20.742
Take your human hands off me!

33:22.000 --> 33:24.742
Get us out of here, Arthur, fast!

33:30.133 --> 33:31.133
- Tis him.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.713
The kha-Khan has returned.

33:42.729 --> 33:45.345
- You'll never get away with this.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.723
Crystal smuggling is an
interplanetary offense.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.315
And so is kidnapping.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.150
Stop that!

33:51.154 --> 33:54.191
You have no right to go
probing around inside me.

34:00.664 --> 34:03.906
- You don't want me because I can't see.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.657
Don't leave me, Orin.

34:05.669 --> 34:07.500
I'll die without you.

34:09.089 --> 34:10.875
- If there's a world above,

34:10.882 --> 34:12.964
I'll find it for you, elan.

34:18.556 --> 34:21.139
- Arthur, where the hell
are the personality circuits

34:21.141 --> 34:23.257
on these g-2 fembots?

34:23.270 --> 34:25.226
- According to the
internal schematics manual

34:25.230 --> 34:27.812
of the g-2 class
government service fembot,

34:27.815 --> 34:29.647
all personal characteristic circuits

34:29.650 --> 34:30.686
are located in her.

34:34.364 --> 34:36.605
You're definitely looking
in the wrong place.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.072
- Well, where are they?

34:38.952 --> 34:41.409
- They're in her posterior.

34:44.456 --> 34:46.243
- You wouldn't dare.

34:48.210 --> 34:49.210
Help, help!

34:55.885 --> 34:56.885
- Dagg?

34:57.804 --> 35:00.090
Why do you risk your
life stealing crystals?

35:00.098 --> 35:02.054
- Because, my little water snake,

35:02.058 --> 35:04.219
the tax collectors of this galaxy

35:04.227 --> 35:06.593
turn an honest worker into a slave.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.345
Rubidimite crystals are the main source

35:08.356 --> 35:10.142
of fuel for the bordogon fleet.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.432
There.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.444
That should do it.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.438
- Hi.

35:18.450 --> 35:19.530
- That's more like it.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.237
- Has anyone ever told you

35:22.245 --> 35:25.362
that you're awfully cute for a meat body?

35:27.375 --> 35:28.581
- Security ran a crosscheck

35:28.585 --> 35:30.371
on the make of that space cruiser

35:30.378 --> 35:32.118
along with the description of the pilot.

35:32.130 --> 35:35.042
His name is dagg dibrimi.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.210
- Good.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.627
I'll take it from here.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.060
All units, security code red.

35:53.151 --> 35:54.561
Name Orin.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.400
Target is young, male,

35:56.404 --> 35:59.487
human, carrying a golden hilt,

35:59.491 --> 36:02.278
traveling in civilian
service class ship, type h,

36:02.285 --> 36:04.492
registered to dagg dibrimi.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.532
Use any means to locate.

36:06.539 --> 36:08.495
Once you have the hilt,

36:08.500 --> 36:10.832
the boy is to be vaporized.

36:26.059 --> 36:28.175
- Kid, this is toga-Togo,

36:28.186 --> 36:32.350
the thickest den of thieves
this side of bordogon.

36:43.743 --> 36:44.573
- When are we going to trinia?

36:44.577 --> 36:46.943
I've got to find the blade.

36:46.955 --> 36:48.786
- Fat chance, water snake.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.200
I've got my own business to take care of.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.448
- Then let me out.

36:51.459 --> 36:52.574
I'll find my own way back.

36:52.585 --> 36:54.291
You'll walk, huh?

36:54.295 --> 36:56.035
50 million miles through a vacuum?

36:56.923 --> 36:58.254
Stick around, water snake.

36:58.258 --> 37:01.045
That blade of yours may be right here.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.043
Let's have those landing lights, Arthur.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.599
Keep an eye on the starchaser, Arthur.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.594
And if anyone goes near the cargo hold,

37:12.605 --> 37:15.563
you have my permission to
blow them into stardust.

37:15.567 --> 37:17.353
- Where are we going, dagg?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.480
I'd rather not tell you.

37:20.488 --> 37:21.523
It's a surprise.

37:22.449 --> 37:24.360
Well, this is where we part.

37:25.618 --> 37:27.028
I hope you find your talking blade.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.151
- But whatdo I do?

37:29.539 --> 37:30.745
Where do I go?

37:30.749 --> 37:33.035
- Figuring that out,
my little water snake,

37:33.042 --> 37:34.623
is what life is all about.

37:44.179 --> 37:45.589
- Who'll give me 2507?

37:45.597 --> 37:46.632
I don't have 250.

37:46.639 --> 37:47.594
You, how about getting those heads

37:47.599 --> 37:48.839
together and giving me 2507?

37:48.850 --> 37:51.432
No 250 no 250, all right
225 once, 225 twice, sold!

37:53.646 --> 37:54.601
-Z'gork!

37:54.606 --> 37:56.062
I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.

37:56.065 --> 37:57.020
-G-27

37:57.025 --> 37:58.390
where'd you get a government fembot?

37:58.401 --> 37:59.311
- Never mind that.

37:59.319 --> 38:00.934
How much for her?

38:00.945 --> 38:01.855
- No!

38:01.863 --> 38:03.569
- On consignment?

38:03.573 --> 38:05.359
- Don't touch me.

38:05.366 --> 38:07.027
15% of whatever she brings.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.821
- I'll be back in an hour.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.193
- Dagg!

38:10.205 --> 38:12.070
- Don't waste your tears on me, honey.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.081
You'll rust.

38:52.705 --> 38:54.661
- Here, look.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.936
- Dagg, my friend!

39:21.943 --> 39:24.309
It has been ages!

39:24.320 --> 39:25.981
- Not long enough, magreb.

39:25.989 --> 39:29.948
- Some men are honest,
some men are thieves.

39:29.951 --> 39:32.909
Only dagg dibrimi is both.

39:32.912 --> 39:35.949
What brings you to the slums of toga-Togo?

39:35.957 --> 39:36.957
- Money.

39:37.709 --> 39:38.539
- What else?

39:38.543 --> 39:40.955
- I've got a load of
crystal hot off the pyramid.

39:42.881 --> 39:43.711
- How much?

39:43.715 --> 39:44.750
- 20 tons.

39:44.757 --> 39:46.588
Half a million, and it's yours.

39:46.593 --> 39:51.428
- For you, I pay special price, 200,000.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.513
Take it or leave it.

39:53.516 --> 39:56.724
- Looks like I'm not the
only thief in toga-Togo.

39:56.728 --> 39:59.219
- There'll be a ship waiting to pick it up

39:59.230 --> 40:02.142
in the vagee desert at noon tomorrow.

40:03.067 --> 40:07.106
Oh, dagg one of my nosey
men thought they saw you

40:07.113 --> 40:09.695
with a young boy this evening.

40:09.699 --> 40:12.691
My girls do not excite you anymore?

40:17.457 --> 40:18.663
You know what to do.

40:25.632 --> 40:26.632
- Fortunes?

40:27.592 --> 40:29.548
Futures revealed?

40:29.552 --> 40:30.632
Five starbacks.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.920
You are lost, yes?

40:34.807 --> 40:38.220
And are searching for
something of great meaning.

40:38.227 --> 40:39.433
- Yes!

40:39.437 --> 40:40.437
How did you know?

40:41.522 --> 40:44.355
How does the flower know to bloom?

40:44.359 --> 40:48.398
How do the stars know to shine?

40:50.698 --> 40:53.314
- Can you tell me where
I'll find the blade?

40:53.326 --> 40:56.238
- Such is not an easy task.

40:56.245 --> 41:00.033
But I believe I can help you.

41:07.966 --> 41:09.706
The path to your goal

41:11.177 --> 41:13.714
is paved with danger.

41:14.847 --> 41:18.385
It is uncertain whether
you have the strength

41:18.393 --> 41:20.725
to survive such a journey.

41:20.728 --> 41:22.059
- Tell me, please!

41:23.940 --> 41:27.182
- You will find what you are looking for

41:28.611 --> 41:33.605
in the darkest regions of
the novaluna rain forest.

41:34.409 --> 41:35.899
- Thank you.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.697
- No, let me go, don't!

41:38.705 --> 41:40.036
- Silica?

41:40.039 --> 41:40.949
- Please!

41:40.957 --> 41:42.993
- Come on, honey, this won't hurt a bit.

41:44.085 --> 41:47.452
- Hey, that's five starbacks!

41:47.463 --> 41:50.079
- Please, I need your help.

41:51.092 --> 41:53.299
- That'll be five starbacks.

41:53.302 --> 41:54.462
In advance.

41:56.222 --> 41:57.902
- Ladies and germs,
next up for the bidding

41:59.267 --> 42:00.473
for the most discerning of masters.

42:00.476 --> 42:02.156
Who'll start the bidding at 500 starbacks?

42:02.937 --> 42:03.937
- 250!

42:04.772 --> 42:05.761
- She's worth more than that junked.

42:05.773 --> 42:06.808
Who'll go 4007?

42:06.816 --> 42:08.647
- I've got to have her, mizzo.

42:08.651 --> 42:10.983
She looks like she'd make
a wonderful housemaid.

42:10.987 --> 42:13.353
- Your father told me never
to bring you here, miss.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.572
This isn't the best
part of town, you know?

42:16.576 --> 42:17.691
How will I explain to him

42:17.702 --> 42:19.613
if you take home another robot?

42:21.664 --> 42:22.619
- Silica!

42:22.623 --> 42:23.623
- Orin!

42:26.335 --> 42:27.495
- 400!

42:27.503 --> 42:28.333
- Wait!

42:28.337 --> 42:29.167
It's a mistake!

42:29.172 --> 42:30.287
She isn't a slave!

42:31.132 --> 42:32.497
Orin, help me!

42:32.508 --> 42:33.714
- If you want her, young man,

42:33.718 --> 42:34.924
you'll have to bid for her,

42:34.927 --> 42:37.714
or else I'll have you thrown out of here.

42:39.057 --> 42:39.887
You with the 14 noses,

42:39.891 --> 42:40.721
you'd think with such a bargain,

42:40.725 --> 42:41.555
you'd be able to sniff it out.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.049
Who'll give me 450, 450, 450.

42:43.061 --> 42:44.346
-450.

42:44.353 --> 42:45.183
- 500.

42:45.188 --> 42:46.018
- We got a 500.

42:46.022 --> 42:47.603
Come on, all you people out there.

42:48.608 --> 42:49.939
- 550.

42:49.942 --> 42:50.772
- 550.

42:50.777 --> 42:51.607
We got a 550.

42:51.611 --> 42:52.475
Who'll make it 6?
- 600!

42:52.487 --> 42:53.317
- 600, we got 600.

42:53.321 --> 42:56.313
650, who'll go 650, right here 6507?

42:56.324 --> 42:57.905
- 650!

42:57.909 --> 42:58.739
- Seven!

42:58.743 --> 43:00.324
- We got 700, 700.

43:00.328 --> 43:02.614
Sees as mmm

43:02.622 --> 43:03.622
- 850!

43:04.540 --> 43:07.247
- 850, 850...
- One thousand!

43:07.251 --> 43:08.286
- 2,000!

43:08.294 --> 43:09.294
-You're cr az y!

43:10.588 --> 43:11.577
It's unbelievable, I'm getting 2,000.

43:11.589 --> 43:14.251
Going once, going twice, sold!

43:14.258 --> 43:15.258
- Yay!

43:16.385 --> 43:18.467
- Well, how much did we get?

43:18.471 --> 43:20.507
A mere 2,000 starbacks.

43:20.515 --> 43:21.755
- 2,000?

43:21.766 --> 43:23.381
Who the hell bought it, the governor?

43:23.392 --> 43:26.884
- No, this fine young gentleman.

43:26.896 --> 43:27.896
- Water snake!

43:28.731 --> 43:30.187
- They tried to take silica!

43:30.191 --> 43:31.226
I got her back for you.

43:31.234 --> 43:33.065
- How would you like to pay for that?

43:34.028 --> 43:35.768
Starbacks or gold?

43:36.614 --> 43:37.899
- What's a starback?

43:40.243 --> 43:42.700
If you can't pay, then I own you.

43:42.703 --> 43:44.659
It's the law.

43:44.664 --> 43:46.780
Sorry, kid, it's the law.

43:51.879 --> 43:52.879
- Hold it, z'gork!

44:01.389 --> 44:03.596
- You're some practical joker, dagg.

44:03.599 --> 44:06.056
For a while there you
almost had me fooled.

44:06.060 --> 44:07.060
- Yeah.

44:08.229 --> 44:10.515
- You two, follow them!

44:21.159 --> 44:21.989
- Can you run as quickly

44:21.993 --> 44:24.075
as you screw things up, water snake?

44:24.078 --> 44:25.078
- What?

45:21.052 --> 45:23.464
- Arthur, open her up!

45:52.708 --> 45:54.915
- Market transport 33517

45:54.919 --> 45:56.705
arriving at eastern base.

45:56.712 --> 45:59.920
Level 9, prepare for tractor b boarding.

45:59.924 --> 46:01.209
- The phi antara system

46:01.217 --> 46:03.378
will be secured within two weeks.

46:03.386 --> 46:05.172
As soon as our forces return

46:05.179 --> 46:06.760
from raya and horbinot,

46:06.764 --> 46:09.221
we'll be ready for the final action.

46:09.225 --> 46:11.807
- Major tagani, what's the status

46:11.811 --> 46:14.302
of dibrimi and the boy?

46:14.313 --> 46:16.599
- They've escaped our men in toga-Togo,

46:16.607 --> 46:19.064
but the secret police have a lead on them.

46:19.068 --> 46:22.401
- Do I have to program every robot myself?

46:24.156 --> 46:25.862
Send out a sub-frequency order

46:25.866 --> 46:28.278
to all mechanicals in this sector.

46:28.286 --> 46:29.696
I want that boy found

46:29.704 --> 46:31.820
and destroyed at all costs.

46:32.790 --> 46:35.748
- If may, sir, why all
the fuss over one boy?

46:35.751 --> 46:40.541
12000 years ago, there was just one.

46:40.548 --> 46:43.255
This time, there will be no mistakes.

46:44.093 --> 46:45.549
I will not fail.

46:48.597 --> 46:50.508
- Novaluna rain forest?

46:50.516 --> 46:51.881
Forget it, kid.

46:51.892 --> 46:52.881
I haven't got enough time

46:52.893 --> 46:54.679
to make it to the vagee desert,

46:54.687 --> 46:57.429
let alone go on some
wild-goose chase to novaluna.

46:57.440 --> 46:59.931
Gotta find the blade, I know.

46:59.942 --> 47:01.978
Don't you ever think of anything else?

47:01.986 --> 47:04.602
Like warp racing or girls?

47:04.613 --> 47:05.819
- I think of my brother.

47:07.116 --> 47:08.231
And elan.

47:08.242 --> 47:09.197
- Elan?

47:09.201 --> 47:11.112
Oh, your girlfriend, huh?

47:11.120 --> 47:12.451
Why don't I take you to her

47:12.455 --> 47:13.820
after I'm done in the desert?

47:14.707 --> 47:17.164
- She's, she's dead.

47:20.171 --> 47:21.786
- Sorry, water snake.

47:21.797 --> 47:23.207
- Zygon killed her.

47:23.215 --> 47:24.876
- Oh, now don't start that again.

48:13.432 --> 48:14.547
- You're late!

48:14.558 --> 48:18.142
- Well, the vagee's not exactly a sandbox.

48:18.145 --> 48:20.227
- You have the crystals?

48:20.231 --> 48:22.392
- You have the money?

48:32.827 --> 48:34.818
Okay, Arthur, blow the ballast.

48:36.539 --> 48:37.745
Sorry to dump and run.

48:42.837 --> 48:44.623
- Just a moment.

48:47.299 --> 48:49.961
You are the one called Orin?

48:54.348 --> 48:56.714
He's worth a million starbacks.

48:56.725 --> 48:58.556
Dead or alive.

48:58.561 --> 49:00.597
- Way overpriced.

49:00.604 --> 49:04.313
- We could cut you in for a third.

49:04.316 --> 49:07.604
Nobody's life could be
worth more than that.

49:07.611 --> 49:08.942
- Not even yours?

49:10.281 --> 49:11.771
If we both don't walk out of here

49:11.782 --> 49:14.319
in the next few seconds,
my ship is programmed

49:14.326 --> 49:16.533
to blow the crap out of this tent.

49:23.335 --> 49:25.417
- Just a thought.

49:25.421 --> 49:30.415
Sand in the wind.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.130
- Step lively, kid.

49:33.137 --> 49:35.549
I don't trust those guys
as far as I can blast them.

49:35.556 --> 49:37.217
- Why didn't you sell me, dagg?

49:37.224 --> 49:38.930
You could have got back
the money I owe you.

49:38.934 --> 49:41.516
- Those cutthroats would
have peeled you like a grape.

49:56.494 --> 49:58.985
Looks like you're my good
luck charm, water snake.

49:58.996 --> 49:59.826
I didn't think we were going

49:59.830 --> 50:01.115
to get out of there alive.

50:03.292 --> 50:05.624
Now where the hell did he come from?

50:05.628 --> 50:08.119
- Will somebody get
rid of that energized pest?

50:08.130 --> 50:10.166
He's fouling my instruments!

50:10.174 --> 50:11.004
- What?

50:11.008 --> 50:12.008
What are you doing?

50:16.639 --> 50:17.799
No.

50:17.806 --> 50:19.546
I think it's trying to tell us something.

50:29.944 --> 50:31.980
Dagg, I think those desert men

50:31.987 --> 50:33.147
gave us more than gold.

50:34.073 --> 50:35.734
- Damn!
- It's a time bomb!

50:35.741 --> 50:38.107
Don't just stand there, get rid of it!

50:38.118 --> 50:39.118
- Bastards!

50:43.040 --> 50:44.450
- Any second now.

50:46.043 --> 50:48.250
- I'd pay half my share to see the look

50:48.254 --> 50:50.870
on the big one's face when he's blown

50:50.881 --> 50:52.337
into cosmic dust.

51:21.287 --> 51:23.403
- They were here less than an hour ago.

51:23.414 --> 51:24.574
- It won't be long now.

51:30.504 --> 51:34.088
- All right, all right,
I'll take you to novaluna.

51:37.469 --> 51:39.710
- Can the blind be made
to see in your world?

51:40.556 --> 51:41.420
- Sometimes.

51:41.432 --> 51:43.593
And it's not my world.

51:43.601 --> 51:46.593
- I hope some day my little
brother can see your world.

51:46.604 --> 51:47.810
I'm going back for him.

51:48.939 --> 51:50.349
As soon as I find the blade.

51:51.233 --> 51:52.598
- Lunchtime!

51:54.320 --> 51:55.651
- What the hell?

51:57.072 --> 51:57.936
I thought I told you

51:57.948 --> 52:00.815
to stay clear of the treetops, Arthur.

52:00.826 --> 52:02.817
- We're nowhere
near the treetops!

52:04.371 --> 52:06.111
- That was just a warning shot.

52:06.123 --> 52:08.580
Reduce speed and prepare for boarding.

52:08.584 --> 52:10.370
- Don't bother with the shields.

52:10.377 --> 52:13.585
That 'bot's about to get a laser enema.

52:27.061 --> 52:28.972
Dusted the little bugger!

52:34.068 --> 52:35.524
- Nice going, dagg.

52:35.527 --> 52:37.859
You just fell for the
oldest trick in the book.

52:38.947 --> 52:41.563
- If you're so smart,
why didn't you warn me?

52:43.994 --> 52:46.110
- Mounted one and two, move in.

52:49.875 --> 52:53.117
- They've got the whole
damn force after us.

52:53.128 --> 52:55.210
There's only one thing we can do.

52:55.214 --> 52:56.374
- Good idea.

52:56.382 --> 52:57.872
I'll transmit our surrender.

52:57.883 --> 52:59.794
- Nobody's surrendering!

52:59.802 --> 53:00.837
We're gonna play a little game

53:00.844 --> 53:02.630
of chicken with them.

53:02.638 --> 53:06.472
- You're joking!

53:35.879 --> 53:37.961
- Five behind us, dagg!

53:37.965 --> 53:39.626
- Give me full retros, Arthur.

53:39.633 --> 53:41.294
- I'll do no such thing.

53:50.144 --> 53:51.725
- Give it everything
you've got, Arthur.

53:51.729 --> 53:53.845
We've got to make it over those mountains.

53:58.610 --> 54:00.692
- Dagg, I'm hurt!

54:00.696 --> 54:02.937
- Try to keep your systems
functioning, Arthur.

54:02.948 --> 54:05.690
Just give me time to land this thing.

54:05.701 --> 54:08.784
Come on, Arthur, just a few more seconds.

54:08.787 --> 54:11.699
- I think I'm dying, dagg.

54:13.876 --> 54:17.460
If there's a heaven for computers, I.

54:17.463 --> 54:19.454
I'll be thinking of you.

54:21.842 --> 54:22.797
- Arthur?

54:22.801 --> 54:23.801
Arthur?

54:51.914 --> 54:55.498
- Zygon will want this
one for questioning.

55:26.365 --> 55:28.526
- Whoa, you organic beast!

55:29.660 --> 55:31.776
Really, miss, next time I hope

55:31.787 --> 55:33.493
you let me take a gravity cycle.

55:34.873 --> 55:36.909
The boy from the auction!

55:36.917 --> 55:39.659
Bordogon security has
an all-points on him.

55:39.670 --> 55:41.456
I'll radio them at once.

55:41.463 --> 55:43.704
- You do, and
you'll be a sanitation robot

55:43.715 --> 55:46.172
for the next 500 years.

55:46.176 --> 55:48.417
We'll take him back to the palace.

55:48.428 --> 55:49.634
- But miss!

55:49.638 --> 55:50.638
- Now!

56:26.717 --> 56:28.378
- Are you all right?

56:29.469 --> 56:30.469
- Elan?

56:32.306 --> 56:34.388
- My name is Aviana.

56:34.391 --> 56:35.391
Who are you?

56:37.060 --> 56:38.060
- I'm Orin.

56:38.812 --> 56:40.052
Where am I?

56:40.063 --> 56:41.553
- You're in the most heavily guarded

56:41.565 --> 56:43.101
bedroom in this star system,

56:43.108 --> 56:45.895
so don't get any ideas.

56:45.903 --> 56:46.938
- Ideas?

56:48.447 --> 56:49.903
About what?

56:49.907 --> 56:51.738
- Judging by the ridiculous sums

56:51.742 --> 56:54.074
you spend on surplus fembots,

56:54.077 --> 56:55.567
I guess the police have good reason

56:55.579 --> 56:56.910
to be tracking you.

56:56.914 --> 56:57.914
- Police?

56:58.874 --> 56:59.874
Dagg!

57:14.640 --> 57:16.346
- You better take it easy.

57:16.350 --> 57:17.840
Who was elan?

57:17.851 --> 57:18.851
- A friend.

57:20.020 --> 57:21.226
From the mines.

57:21.229 --> 57:22.229
- The crystal mines?

57:23.774 --> 57:26.311
So you're a crystal runner!

57:26.318 --> 57:28.309
Had a friend on the inside, huh?

57:28.320 --> 57:29.560
- Yes.

57:29.571 --> 57:30.777
But dagg said everyone knows

57:30.781 --> 57:32.863
there are no humans in the mines.

57:32.866 --> 57:34.527
How is it that you know about my people?

57:34.534 --> 57:35.649
- Your people?

57:35.661 --> 57:37.492
What are you talking about?

57:39.289 --> 57:40.995
The hilt said that...

57:40.999 --> 57:42.580
- Is this what you're looking for?

57:42.584 --> 57:44.165
- Careful!

57:44.169 --> 57:46.706
- I think the crash scrambled your brains!

57:46.713 --> 57:48.544
Humans in the mines!

57:48.548 --> 57:50.584
My father would never allow it!

57:50.592 --> 57:51.581
- Who is your father?

57:51.593 --> 57:53.174
- Why, morbro, of course.

57:54.388 --> 57:55.218
- Morbro?

57:55.222 --> 57:58.430
- Supreme governor of the bordogon system.

57:58.433 --> 58:00.924
Don't tell me you've never heard of him!

58:00.936 --> 58:02.051
- I'm getting sick and tired

58:02.062 --> 58:03.177
of never understanding.

58:05.190 --> 58:06.805
Where is the truth you promised?

58:19.037 --> 58:21.653
- Shall I take him
to the police now, miss?

58:21.665 --> 58:22.665
- No!

58:28.964 --> 58:31.376
My planetary history lessons!

58:31.383 --> 58:32.873
- What?
- Come on!

58:38.056 --> 58:40.047
- Try to imagine a needle

58:40.058 --> 58:42.094
the thickness of a human hair

58:42.102 --> 58:45.060
slowly thrust between your eyes

58:45.063 --> 58:46.769
and penetrating your skull.

58:46.773 --> 58:49.059
- I'd rather not, if
it's all the same to you.

58:50.694 --> 58:51.558
- Ready, sir.

58:51.570 --> 58:54.152
- Last chance, Mr. dibrimi.

58:54.156 --> 58:55.896
Where is the boy?

58:55.907 --> 58:57.772
- I told you, we all crashed together.

58:57.784 --> 58:59.570
That was the last I saw of him.

59:05.459 --> 59:07.700
- Where is the boy?

59:07.711 --> 59:09.326
- I don't know.

59:09.337 --> 59:11.077
I swear I don't know.

59:17.054 --> 59:17.964
- Religious myth.

59:17.971 --> 59:21.555
Entry number 111.3.

59:21.558 --> 59:22.843
The book of kha-Khan.

59:22.851 --> 59:24.682
- I knew it was in here!

59:24.686 --> 59:26.392
Tell us about this.

59:26.396 --> 59:28.557
- According to
the book of kha-Khan,

59:28.565 --> 59:32.524
1,200 years ago, a human
possessing a golden hilt

59:32.527 --> 59:35.690
was reported to have crushed
a planetary dictatorship

59:35.697 --> 59:37.813
which spanned 52 solar systems.

59:37.824 --> 59:38.904
- It's him!

59:38.909 --> 59:40.695
The face on the blade!

59:40.702 --> 59:42.112
- 600 years later,

59:42.120 --> 59:44.202
another possessed of a bladeless sword

59:44.206 --> 59:46.447
freed galaxy 13 from a tyrant

59:46.458 --> 59:49.165
by the name of nexus,
who attempted to enslave

59:49.169 --> 59:52.912
the entire population with
electronic mind control.

59:52.923 --> 59:54.663
- I must find the blade!

59:54.674 --> 59:55.914
Tell me where it is.

59:55.926 --> 59:56.961
Please!

59:56.968 --> 59:57.957
- There is no record

59:57.969 --> 59:59.675
of the blade's continued existence

59:59.679 --> 01:00:01.465
since the defeat of nexus.

01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:04.840
It was presumed lost after
the final battle on trinia.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:05.886
- Trinia?

01:00:05.894 --> 01:00:07.850
But where on trinia?

01:00:07.854 --> 01:00:09.435
- There is no
record of the blade's

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.430
continued existence since the defeat.

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.056
- I've got to get back to trinia.

01:00:13.902 --> 01:00:15.267
- A hilt.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.018
And humans in the mine.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.691
My father can help you!

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:20.154
- Begging your pardon, miss,

01:00:20.158 --> 01:00:21.944
but he is a wanted man.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:24.075
Your father would likely have him

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:26.411
arrested and ask questions later.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:30.036
- If my father can't help us,

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:32.910
we'll just have to help ourselves.

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:35.037
Mizzo, fuel up the ship.

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:36.663
We're going to trinia.

01:00:40.679 --> 01:00:42.635
- Sir, an unscheduled craft just came out

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:44.721
of sub-space on arrival coordinates.

01:00:44.724 --> 01:00:46.089
Identity scan indicates it's

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:49.184
a personal transport belonging to.

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:50.893
Supreme governor morbro!

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:52.387
- Route it through.

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:53.399
I'll alert zygon.

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.733
- Are you sure this will work?

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:06.234
- Trust me.

01:01:06.246 --> 01:01:08.282
- This is a restricted area.

01:01:08.290 --> 01:01:10.326
No one may enter without prior permission

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:12.995
from the commissioner of mining.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:14.584
- I think we better leave, miss.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.162
- Show him the search warrant.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:21.337
- I'm sorry, this is a restricted area.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.676
No one may enter without
prior permission...

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:24.635
- Mizzo, shoot him!

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:25.754
- But miss!

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:27.756
- I said shoot him!

01:01:30.103 --> 01:01:31.889
- I hope you know what you're doing.

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:33.478
- So do I.

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:36.775
- Let me try.

01:01:50.665 --> 01:01:52.280
- There must be an elevator to the mine

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:53.372
around here somewhere.

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:14.845
Oh, commissioner, I'm glad you're here.

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:16.096
Orin, tell commissioner zygon

01:02:16.107 --> 01:02:17.893
what you told me.

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.482
I don't have to tell him.

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:21.898
He knows all about the
humans in the mines.

01:02:21.905 --> 01:02:23.486
- Orin!

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.151
- Put down the hilt, boy.

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:26.238
The game is over.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:30.828
His story of the mine is
just a clever diversion.

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:32.661
We've already caught his partner.

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:33.872
Dibrimi, isn't it?

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.493
He confessed everything
about the crystal raid

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:39.790
and your little escapade
in the vagee desert.

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:42.664
- Orin, is it true?

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:43.676
- Murderer!

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:51.809
- No!

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:57.394
You, a robot?

01:02:58.525 --> 01:02:59.389
- No.

01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:01.062
Not just a robot.

01:03:01.069 --> 01:03:03.185
I am the robot.

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:04.436
- Nexus!

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:07.564
- The young kha-Khan is
perceptive for a human.

01:03:07.575 --> 01:03:09.566
I have been putting the
pieces back together

01:03:09.577 --> 01:03:11.943
for over a thousand years.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:13.536
- Mizzo, blast him!

01:03:16.876 --> 01:03:19.413
You'll never succeed, zygon.

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:21.503
It would take millions of robots

01:03:21.506 --> 01:03:24.589
hundreds of years to take over the system.

01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:28.505
- You are as blind as
you are mortal, my dear.

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:31.346
I not only have millions of robots,

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:32.759
they have been slowly taking over

01:03:32.767 --> 01:03:35.509
for the last 12 centuries.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.102
Trinia, like dozens of other planets,

01:03:38.106 --> 01:03:40.313
was conquered by my forces,

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:41.477
its human population

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:43.975
driven underground to mine the crystals,

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:45.852
allowing me to reprogram thousands

01:03:45.864 --> 01:03:48.947
of your mining robots into soldiers.

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:50.486
- I swear I'll stop you.

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:51.983
And if not me, then another.

01:03:51.995 --> 01:03:54.657
- There is no stopping evolution.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:57.451
From the primordial ooze to man.

01:03:57.459 --> 01:03:59.495
From man to robot.

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:03.916
The dinosaur went
extinct, and so shall you.

01:04:03.923 --> 01:04:06.039
The kha-Khan stopped me last time.

01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:07.541
This time, you have only served

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:09.668
to hasten the inevitable.

01:04:09.679 --> 01:04:14.298
Without this, you are but
a weak piece of flesh.

01:04:14.309 --> 01:04:18.177
Tell me, kha-Khan, what is
the secret of its power?

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:22.684
- I don't know.

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:23.692
- You know.

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:26.234
And you will talk.

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:39.291
- Arthur?

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.037
- Where am 1?

01:04:43.922 --> 01:04:44.922
Oh, dear!

01:04:46.049 --> 01:04:47.459
What have you done to me?

01:04:47.467 --> 01:04:48.331
I'm naked!

01:04:48.343 --> 01:04:50.925
Put my ship back on, you perverted fembot!

01:04:52.347 --> 01:04:54.429
- I was only trying to help.

01:04:54.432 --> 01:04:56.593
Ungrateful son of a bit!

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:03.813
- My head's making enough
racket without your help.

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.400
- Dagg!

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:09.690
I thought you were dead!

01:05:09.697 --> 01:05:11.904
- You thought right, water snake.

01:05:11.908 --> 01:05:15.071
- Battalion commander
argo to flight deck 9.

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:17.490
Battalion commander argo to flight deck 9.

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:19.704
- There simply aren't enough
robot troops in this sector

01:05:19.707 --> 01:05:22.198
to successfully take
over the bordogon system.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.747
To attack now would be futile, sir.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:27.086
- We must strike now.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.626
It won't be long before morbro

01:05:28.633 --> 01:05:30.089
realizes his daughter is missing

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:31.674
and tracks her here.

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:32.884
If he discovers what we're doing,

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:35.549
he could mount a counteroffensive.

01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:37.218
I'm one solar system away

01:05:37.225 --> 01:05:38.886
from complete subjugation

01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:40.804
of intelligent organic life.

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:45.142
I will not fail this time.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.356
What is our present status?

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:48.771
All ships are being armed
with xenon warheads.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:49.858
15 attack battalions

01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:52.149
of 1,000 troops each are standing ready.

01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:55.115
The last five battle cruisers
are still under construction.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:57.234
- We'll have to make do without them.

01:05:57.245 --> 01:06:00.863
We have two things in our favor, surprise

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:04.366
and something very dear
to the supreme governor.

01:06:04.377 --> 01:06:06.083
He'll think twice before he destroys

01:06:06.087 --> 01:06:08.328
a warship with his daughter aboard.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:10.831
- It must have been horrible

01:06:10.842 --> 01:06:13.504
slaving in the mine your entire life.

01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:14.511
- It was horrible.

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:17.261
But not as horrible as
the thought of my people

01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:18.755
suffering at this very moment,

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:21.970
their entire world one big lie.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.093
I failed them.

01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:25.727
I found a new world,

01:06:25.732 --> 01:06:27.688
but they'll never know it exists.

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:29.853
All I had to do was find a stupid blade.

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:31.904
And I failed.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:36.694
- I'm sorry.

01:06:36.701 --> 01:06:40.159
If I hadn't been so impulsive,
you might've succeeded.

01:06:40.163 --> 01:06:42.074
- No.

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:43.662
- No, it wasn't your fault.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.622
- You don't understand, Orin.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:49.494
I didn't take you back here

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:51.337
because I wanted to help you

01:06:51.341 --> 01:06:52.581
free your people.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.710
I did it for me.

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:00.262
Because I wanted to be with you.

01:07:01.392 --> 01:07:02.392
Because.

01:07:18.535 --> 01:07:19.445
Where are you taking me?

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:21.363
- Let go of her!
- Orin!

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:28.165
- You're lucky, water snake.

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:29.659
He hit you with the soft end.

01:07:33.758 --> 01:07:35.874
- The attack
force is ready, zygon.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:38.797
Bordogon's planetary radar
sources are being jammed.

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:41.296
Battalion commanders are
awaiting your orders.

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:45.676
- Thousands of years ago,
on some obscure planet,

01:07:45.687 --> 01:07:47.552
a primitive chess computer was

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:51.853
the first inorganic mind to beat man.

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:55.443
In a few hours, I will
be calling checkmate

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:57.562
in the last such game the humans

01:07:57.574 --> 01:07:59.485
and their kind will ever play.

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:20.005
- Save your knuckles, water snake.

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:21.173
There's no way out.

01:08:31.482 --> 01:08:33.143
- Starfly!

01:08:33.151 --> 01:08:34.732
I need your help!

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:36.100
Get me the hilt.

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:40.984
Please, I know you can do it!

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:42.732
I must have the hilt!

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:44.859
- Who the hell are you talking to?

01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:47.032
- Don't need hilt.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.871
- Yes, yes, I need it.

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:49.955
Get me the hilt!

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:20.353
- Attack squadron
three, clear for ion-burn.

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:26.822
- Squadron leader
three, all ships away.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.910
- What's wrong with the screens?

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:33.078
- I'm not sure.

01:09:45.555 --> 01:09:46.555
That did it!

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.187
- Thank you!

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.105
- You say something?

01:09:56.109 --> 01:09:58.350
Guard, I have something for you!

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:05.319
- What's going on, water snake?

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:18.327
- Come on!

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:20.830
- How the hell do you do that?

01:10:22.093 --> 01:10:23.253
- We've got to get to Aviana.

01:10:23.261 --> 01:10:24.250
- Hold it!

01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:25.422
You don't even know where she is.

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:27.796
If you want to get out
of here alive, follow me.

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:31.768
Damn!

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.088
Damn!

01:11:06.929 --> 01:11:08.965
Those aren't crystal freighters.

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:10.179
They're warships.

01:11:10.183 --> 01:11:11.218
- There she is!

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:16.101
- That's great, only
how we gonna get to her

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:17.766
without getting our heads shot off?

01:11:17.774 --> 01:11:19.639
- We'll just have to do our best.

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.606
- Gee, why didn't I think of that?

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:36.371
- This is admiral Casey

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:38.036
aboard the flagship, sir.

01:11:38.044 --> 01:11:39.955
All ships have cleared the atmosphere.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.873
Awaiting your permission
to join the fleet.

01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:43.746
Flagship squadron,

01:11:43.758 --> 01:11:45.168
proceed with ion-burn.

01:11:58.981 --> 01:11:59.936
- Damn!

01:11:59.941 --> 01:12:00.941
She's taking off!

01:12:05.655 --> 01:12:07.646
- All ships in position, admiral.

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.773
Squadron one, cleared for light speed.

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:15.111
- When your fleet is spotted,

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:17.659
you'll all be blown out of the stars.

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:20.659
- By the time the bordogon
defense command discovers us,

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:22.877
they'll be smoldering flesh.

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:27.836
Secure for acceleration to hyper-light.

01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:34.089
- Great, we just went into light speed.

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:36.476
Damn!

01:12:47.822 --> 01:12:50.063
- What in the
world is taking you so long?

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:51.484
We've got to find dagg!

01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:52.652
Next thing you know,

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.150
you'll be putting up curtains.

01:12:56.163 --> 01:12:57.163
Hit me, will you!

01:12:58.082 --> 01:12:59.082
I'll show you.

01:13:11.679 --> 01:13:13.670
- All ships reducing to sub-light.

01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:16.844
Eta to bordogon, one minute.

01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:27.767
- All but 12 squadrons
have left hyperspace, sir.

01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:28.688
- Good.

01:13:28.696 --> 01:13:30.561
Put all squadrons on standby

01:13:30.573 --> 01:13:32.404
for warhead activation.

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:41.681
- Captain, scanners are picking up

01:14:41.686 --> 01:14:42.926
debris from the flagship.

01:14:54.407 --> 01:14:56.443
All squadrons reduced to sub-light.

01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:58.236
Ready to deploy.

01:14:58.244 --> 01:14:59.654
- Arm all warheads.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:04.708
- Orin!

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:15.215
- Hey, knock it off!

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:31.774
- This is squadron leader seven.

01:15:31.777 --> 01:15:33.893
Urgent request direct link to zygon.

01:15:35.072 --> 01:15:36.357
- This is zygon.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:37.730
- Sir, we have a problem.

01:15:37.742 --> 01:15:38.572
The flagship appears to have

01:15:38.576 --> 01:15:40.612
jettisoned its ground forces.

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:42.029
Request instructions.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:43.994
- Have you contacted them?

01:15:43.998 --> 01:15:45.158
- We have tried, sir.

01:15:45.166 --> 01:15:46.702
There is no reply.

01:15:46.709 --> 01:15:48.449
All communications with the flagship

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:50.076
appear to have been severed.

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:51.452
Request further...

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.180
- The hilt!

01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:06.144
No!

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:08.646
It can't be!

01:16:10.191 --> 01:16:12.352
Attack squadrons two and three,

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:14.812
destroy the flagship!

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:19.234
- All other squadrons
proceed to target area

01:16:19.241 --> 01:16:21.106
and launch missiles manually.

01:16:21.118 --> 01:16:22.699
- Dagg, do something!

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:24.193
We've got to save bordogon!

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:25.869
- Good idea.

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:26.953
And while I'm doing that,

01:16:26.957 --> 01:16:28.697
you get on those gun controls.

01:16:36.801 --> 01:16:38.587
- We'll never
find anything to help dagg

01:16:38.594 --> 01:16:40.880
if you keep playing
hide-and-seek down here.

01:16:40.888 --> 01:16:42.424
- We won't make toga-Togo at all

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.046
if we're spotted, you twit.

01:16:45.392 --> 01:16:47.599
- Uh oh, we're spotted.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:48.809
- What?

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:53.773
Oh, no!

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.176
- Arthur, heads up!

01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:28.466
- It's dagg!

01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:30.809
- Pull up, pull up!

01:17:49.331 --> 01:17:50.992
- In case you've forgotten,

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:53.742
someone's world is about to blow.

01:17:58.132 --> 01:17:59.132
Terrific.

01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:02.216
No operating manual.

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:06.712
- All squadrons now in
position over target zones.

01:18:06.724 --> 01:18:07.839
- Deploy the missiles.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:13.810
- I must get through

01:18:13.814 --> 01:18:15.145
to the main targeting computer.

01:18:16.108 --> 01:18:17.348
Somehow, I've got to detonate

01:18:17.359 --> 01:18:19.270
those missiles before they're launched.

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:20.643
- Squadron sixteen reporting.

01:18:20.654 --> 01:18:21.985
All missiles ready.

01:18:21.989 --> 01:18:23.445
Arm warheads.

01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:24.449
- Dagg.

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.571
- Warheads armed and ready.

01:18:28.579 --> 01:18:30.194
- They're launching!
- Damn!

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:36.746
- Dagagq, it's trying to help us again!

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.421
(Beeping_

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:15.500
- the fleet!

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:17.874
It's gone!

01:19:17.878 --> 01:19:19.209
- Call in our forces from the raya

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:21.044
and horbinot systems.

01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:22.538
- They'll never reach us in time.

01:19:22.549 --> 01:19:24.005
We've got to evacuate.

01:19:24.009 --> 01:19:25.340
- No.

01:19:25.344 --> 01:19:27.551
He'll be coming for me next.

01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:31.134
But I'll be ready for him.

01:19:32.268 --> 01:19:34.350
- Plot a course for novaluna.

01:19:34.353 --> 01:19:35.353
- No!

01:19:36.438 --> 01:19:37.803
We're going back to trinia.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:41.148
- We just destroyed an entire fleet,

01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:42.857
but I'm not pressing my luck, kid.

01:19:42.861 --> 01:19:44.101
- Wait, dagg.

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.148
If it wasn't for Orin,

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:47.271
we probably would be dead by now.

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:49.490
We can't abandon him
when he needs our help.

01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:54.414
- Damn!

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:05.380
- See, I told you.

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:06.715
Nobody's home.

01:20:06.719 --> 01:20:08.584
We may as well go back.

01:20:08.595 --> 01:20:10.426
- You promised!

01:20:10.431 --> 01:20:12.217
- Keep your shirt on, kid.

01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:13.634
They're home, all right.

01:20:23.986 --> 01:20:26.318
- All the doors
on this side are closed!

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:37.408
- Silica, they got a
back door to this joint?

01:20:37.416 --> 01:20:38.952
- I think, there's an air vent

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:40.119
in the processing area.

01:20:47.134 --> 01:20:48.795
- Which one is the vent?

01:20:48.802 --> 01:20:50.417
- Let's hope it's the open one.

01:20:51.638 --> 01:20:54.721
- Dagg, I'll just wait here.

01:20:54.725 --> 01:20:57.182
- Get your butt in here!

01:20:57.186 --> 01:21:00.770
- I know I'm
going to regret this.

01:21:14.828 --> 01:21:16.944
What's that noise?

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:18.786
- We're not in the air vent.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:19.906
- What?

01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:22.329
- Dagg, we're in a crystal waste tube.

01:21:22.336 --> 01:21:23.576
- Oh, terrific!

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:31.799
- It's gaining!

01:21:31.804 --> 01:21:34.090
- That looks like
the end of the tunnel.

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:35.304
- Gangway!

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:49.359
- Kha-Khan, you are mine.

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:57.492
- Damn!

01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:58.861
A tractor beam's locked on to us.

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:02.365
Arthur, you got any ideas?

01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:03.866
- Dagg's in trouble!

01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:05.117
- Can't break free!

01:22:07.798 --> 01:22:09.789
- We're almost out!

01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:14.794
- Dagg, we gotta save him!

01:22:21.186 --> 01:22:22.517
- Whoa!

01:22:27.317 --> 01:22:28.147
Now you've done it!

01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:29.938
We'll be scrap iron for sure!

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.060
- We made it!

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:33.733
- What happened to Arthur?

01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:36.447
- Don't worry about
that now, water snake.

01:22:36.452 --> 01:22:37.612
Worry about our host.

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:41.198
We're not out of this yet.

01:22:46.462 --> 01:22:48.748
See if you can spot a
way down to the mines.

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:51.379
Damn!

01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:53.044
Look at all the crystals down there!

01:22:53.051 --> 01:22:54.712
This little adventure might turn out

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.506
to be very profitable.

01:22:57.389 --> 01:22:58.219
- Look!

01:22:58.223 --> 01:22:59.759
There's the mine elevator.

01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:03.092
- Sorry, kid, you'll have to take

01:23:03.103 --> 01:23:04.684
a rain check on the mines.

01:23:10.027 --> 01:23:15.021
Going up!

01:23:18.452 --> 01:23:20.158
- Sound full alert.

01:23:20.162 --> 01:23:21.447
All units attack!

01:23:22.498 --> 01:23:24.284
- All robots
to your command posts.

01:23:24.291 --> 01:23:25.701
This is not a drill.

01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:30.127
All robots to your command posts.

01:23:30.130 --> 01:23:31.870
- Squadrons to your battle stations.

01:23:31.882 --> 01:23:36.876
This is not a drill.

01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:39.261
- Hang on!

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:40.424
We've got company.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:48.307
- Now what?

01:23:48.315 --> 01:23:50.271
-You don't wanna know.

01:23:52.319 --> 01:23:55.277
- Just like old times, eh, water snake?

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:13.496
That Cannon's giving me a headache.

01:24:13.507 --> 01:24:14.997
Let's take it out.

01:24:25.227 --> 01:24:28.719
- Zygon, we don't have enough firepower.

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:29.890
We must evacuate.

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:31.934
- Get back to your post!

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:58.256
- Good heavens!

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:07.508
We've been freed!
- Hurry, Arthur!

01:25:08.979 --> 01:25:09.809
Oh, no!

01:25:09.813 --> 01:25:11.474
They're shooting at dagg!

01:25:11.481 --> 01:25:13.597
Watch your back!

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:15.440
- Silica, Arthur!

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:16.775
What kept you?

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:18.518
- You okay?

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:19.986
- But we're not.

01:25:19.990 --> 01:25:21.696
- Keep up your force shield.

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:23.486
- Ouch, good suggestion.

01:25:28.749 --> 01:25:31.786
- All fighters, break off laser attack.

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:34.535
Set ion engines for maximum overload

01:25:34.546 --> 01:25:36.662
and ram the flagship!

01:25:40.636 --> 01:25:42.342
- They've stopped firing!

01:25:49.519 --> 01:25:50.804
- Dagg!

01:25:50.812 --> 01:25:53.224
- Dagg's going down!

01:26:17.214 --> 01:26:19.705
- Aviana, are you all right?

01:26:19.716 --> 01:26:20.716
- I think so.

01:26:22.219 --> 01:26:23.334
- I can't get up.

01:26:26.890 --> 01:26:28.881
- Your leg must be broken.

01:26:28.892 --> 01:26:30.803
- Oh, no, dagg!

01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:32.301
Hurry, Arthur!

01:26:32.312 --> 01:26:34.894
- We're being shot at.

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:46.064
- Oh, dagg, you're hurt!

01:26:46.076 --> 01:26:46.906
Dagg.

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:48.150
- Leg's broken.

01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:49.321
But I'll live.

01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:52.662
- I must go now to free my people.

01:26:53.667 --> 01:26:54.656
- I'm going with you.

01:26:54.668 --> 01:26:56.909
- No, it's too dangerous.

01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:57.750
- But...

01:26:57.754 --> 01:26:58.743
- No.

01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:00.620
You must stay with dagg.

01:27:00.632 --> 01:27:01.917
- Be careful, Orin!

01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:05.376
I don't want to lose you.

01:27:05.387 --> 01:27:06.843
- I'll be back.

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:07.677
- Hurry up!

01:27:07.681 --> 01:27:09.091
We're sitting ducks out here!

01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:11.135
- Take care of her, dagg.

01:27:11.143 --> 01:27:12.143
- Sure, kid.

01:27:14.563 --> 01:27:15.598
- I knew it!

01:27:16.606 --> 01:27:18.642
- He's okay, let's hurry!

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:22.813
- Lt can't be!

01:27:25.157 --> 01:27:26.818
- Hurry up!

01:27:29.369 --> 01:27:30.700
- Zygon!

01:27:30.704 --> 01:27:32.945
- Aviana, come back!

01:27:36.585 --> 01:27:37.745
- Zygon!

01:27:37.753 --> 01:27:38.583
Zygon!

01:27:38.587 --> 01:27:39.587
Zygon!

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:54.018
- Orin?

01:27:57.314 --> 01:27:58.394
- Orin, Orin!

01:27:59.357 --> 01:28:01.188
I knew he'd come back!

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:08.272
- Ever since I can remember,

01:28:08.283 --> 01:28:10.069
there have been rumors

01:28:10.076 --> 01:28:13.068
rumors that there was another world,

01:28:13.079 --> 01:28:14.569
that long ago, there was more

01:28:14.581 --> 01:28:16.697
than just mineworld.

01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:18.699
Some said it was a heaven,

01:28:18.710 --> 01:28:21.622
a paradise beyond imagination.

01:28:21.630 --> 01:28:23.712
Others said it was a hell,

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:26.627
far worse than the world we know now.

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:30.628
But an old man saw the
truth beyond the sword

01:28:30.639 --> 01:28:32.800
and gave his life so that I might

01:28:32.808 --> 01:28:34.844
reach out beyond these caverns,

01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:37.843
reach out to the greater world above.

01:28:37.854 --> 01:28:39.594
Well, I have reached,

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:41.722
and I have touched the stars.

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:43.223
- Don't listen to him.

01:28:43.235 --> 01:28:46.398
Zygon has warned of such false saviors.

01:28:46.404 --> 01:28:47.439
- He's right!

01:28:47.447 --> 01:28:50.985
Believing this fool will
only bring disaster!

01:28:50.992 --> 01:28:53.779
- Zygon is your enslaver.

01:28:53.787 --> 01:28:56.199
He says what he wants you to believe.

01:28:58.542 --> 01:29:00.123
- The boy is right.

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:02.371
- Zygon!

01:29:02.379 --> 01:29:05.041
- I say what I want you to believe,

01:29:05.048 --> 01:29:09.166
because I want you to believe the truth.

01:29:09.177 --> 01:29:10.041
- Zygon!

01:29:10.053 --> 01:29:10.883
Zygon!

01:29:10.887 --> 01:29:11.717
Zygon!

01:29:11.721 --> 01:29:13.302
- Liar!

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:28.401
- Orin!

01:29:31.825 --> 01:29:33.565
- Give me the hilt, kha-Khan,

01:29:33.577 --> 01:29:36.159
or she will die like the other.

01:30:17.871 --> 01:30:18.871
- Look!

01:30:24.586 --> 01:30:26.702
- Get me, get me the hilt!

01:30:27.714 --> 01:30:31.206
- You do not need the hilt, Orin.

01:30:31.217 --> 01:30:33.208
There never was a blade.

01:30:39.392 --> 01:30:42.976
- This time you've lost
for good, kha-Khan.

01:30:48.818 --> 01:30:49.818
Let go!

01:31:14.594 --> 01:31:15.594
But.

01:31:16.596 --> 01:31:17.961
How?

01:31:17.973 --> 01:31:19.929
- You were right, zygon.

01:31:19.933 --> 01:31:22.345
I did know the secret
of the blade all along,

01:31:22.352 --> 01:31:24.684
only it was so simple,
I couldn't even see it.

01:31:26.523 --> 01:31:28.104
- No.

01:31:28.108 --> 01:31:29.108
Stay back!

01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:48.708
- Get the guards!
- Come on!

01:31:48.712 --> 01:31:49.712
Come on!

01:32:16.614 --> 01:32:18.946
Spread the word throughout mineworld.

01:32:18.950 --> 01:32:19.950
We are free!

01:32:26.916 --> 01:32:28.031
- Don't worry, dagg.

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:29.032
I'll fix it for you.

01:32:29.044 --> 01:32:30.784
- If you don't kill him first.

01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:34.162
Dagg, do you want me to take over for you?

01:32:34.174 --> 01:32:35.710
- Just relax, Arthur.

01:32:35.717 --> 01:32:36.672
I'll get dagg out of this.

01:32:36.676 --> 01:32:38.257
- It's okay, silica.

01:32:38.261 --> 01:32:41.799
I can take it from here.

01:32:41.806 --> 01:32:42.966
Silica!

01:32:42.974 --> 01:32:44.839
- Just take it easy.

01:32:44.851 --> 01:32:46.136
I've got that creep now!

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:51.346
- Silica, no, not in the crystals!

01:32:51.357 --> 01:32:52.813
Damn!

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:55.149
- What have I done?

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:46.280
- Stand back!

01:34:26.286 --> 01:34:27.286
Follow me!

01:34:38.423 --> 01:34:39.458
- He did it!

01:34:39.465 --> 01:34:42.332
The water snake got 'em out!

01:34:42.343 --> 01:34:45.176
- Hooray, hooray, hooray!

01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:48.012
- Oh, dagg, I'm sorry.

01:35:00.862 --> 01:35:02.853
- What does it look like, Orin?

01:35:02.864 --> 01:35:03.864
Tell me!

01:35:37.732 --> 01:35:39.893
I can see again!

01:35:39.901 --> 01:35:40.901
I can see!

01:35:41.903 --> 01:35:42.903
I can see!

01:36:22.735 --> 01:36:26.398
- You have done admirably, young Orin.

01:36:26.406 --> 01:36:29.113
We welcome you as an honored member

01:36:29.117 --> 01:36:30.402
of the kha-Khan.

01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:36.033
You are free to leave your human form

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.325
and come with us.

01:36:39.502 --> 01:36:40.502
- Not yet.

01:36:41.671 --> 01:36:44.128
I'd like to stretch my
legs for a few decades.

01:36:48.177 --> 01:36:49.713
- The choice is yours.
