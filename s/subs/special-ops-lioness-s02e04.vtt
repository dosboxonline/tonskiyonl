00:02.136 --> 00:04.238
* MTV *

00:06.840 --> 00:10.078
[Westfield] So, she stated
she doesn't speak Spanish.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.779
[Joe]
In her initial interview.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.248
She stated that she had
no knowledge about her uncle

00:14.348 --> 00:16.917
and that her parents only
encouraged her to speak English.

00:17.017 --> 00:19.520
But she does speak Spanish
and she is aware of the uncle,

00:19.653 --> 00:21.589
even though
she stated otherwise.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.957
-That is correct.
-Wow.

00:24.024 --> 00:27.161
Well, that is
a staggering discovery, Joe.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.996
You know, what did you
expect her to say

00:29.097 --> 00:31.365
when you cornered her
in some CO's office in Iraq

00:31.465 --> 00:34.368
and started pounding her
with questions about her family?

00:34.502 --> 00:36.137
She's an Army officer, Byron,
I expect her

00:36.237 --> 00:38.139
-to fucking tell the truth.
-While you headhunt

00:38.206 --> 00:40.040
for her uncle and use her father
for the introduction--

00:40.141 --> 00:42.410
She doesn't need an
introduction. That's the point.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.877
Tone and volume, Joe.

00:43.977 --> 00:45.546
Find different levels
for both, please.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.748
-Sure.
-[Westfield] When her father

00:47.881 --> 00:49.883
makes the intro
and the Lioness is discovered,

00:50.017 --> 00:52.353
and she will be discovered
in some capacity,

00:52.420 --> 00:55.556
her father is dead,
her mother is dead.

00:55.656 --> 00:58.259
Any siblings she might have,
they'll also be killed.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.893
And you find it odd

01:00.027 --> 01:01.995
that she'd be resistant
to such an endeavor?

01:02.062 --> 01:05.266
I find it troublesome, yes.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.735
Let me ask you this:

01:07.835 --> 01:09.570
did she volunteer
or did you coerce her?

01:09.670 --> 01:10.904
That isn't
an either-or question.

01:11.038 --> 01:13.073
Oh, it is absolutely
an either-or question.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.942
Either she volunteered

01:15.075 --> 01:17.145
-or you coerced her. Which one--
-She volunteered.

01:17.245 --> 01:18.612
With some coercion.

01:18.712 --> 01:20.114
Okay, now we're
getting somewhere.

01:20.248 --> 01:21.914
[Joe] I didn't choose her.
This was chosen for me

01:22.015 --> 01:24.852
by eight different agencies
all playing head chief.

01:24.952 --> 01:27.721
Why don't we treat her
as a double agent,

01:27.821 --> 01:29.923
put an operator on her
who will act as a shadow,

01:30.057 --> 01:31.658
goes where she goes,
knows what she knows?

01:31.759 --> 01:33.227
[Westfield] At least we have
some measure of control

01:33.327 --> 01:34.428
-if she flips.
-Mm-hmm.

01:34.562 --> 01:36.364
How does that give us control
if she flips?

01:36.430 --> 01:39.066
If the operator is close,
at least we protect the program.

01:39.167 --> 01:41.769
[scoffs] How is that different
from a drone strike?

01:41.869 --> 01:44.271
Right, it's just
a smaller projectile, right?

01:44.405 --> 01:46.740
Let's not forget
the overriding objective here.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.776
I never forget the objective.

01:48.876 --> 01:51.345
It's the people under round
roofs who lose sight of success

01:51.445 --> 01:53.447
the minute they order
a fucking op

01:53.547 --> 01:54.882
and then they shift focus

01:54.948 --> 01:56.717
to covering their asses
if it fails.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.453
Let's talk about failure
for a second, Joe.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.222
All right, these aren't
some Houthi rebels

02:01.289 --> 02:02.690
operating out of caves in Yemen.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.426
These are leaders
of a trillion-dollar industry

02:05.526 --> 02:07.961
with an intelligence
and paramilitary arm

02:08.061 --> 02:10.464
operating and controlling
whole neighborhoods

02:10.564 --> 02:12.933
in every major city in America.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.270
Someone exposing our program

02:16.337 --> 02:19.240
exposes our officers,
their families.

02:19.340 --> 02:20.941
Your family.

02:21.008 --> 02:23.311
Should she turn,
and I hope she doesn't,

02:23.411 --> 02:26.214
the moment she makes that
decision needs to be the last.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.051
[inhales]

02:31.151 --> 02:33.687
[sighs]

02:33.787 --> 02:35.389
-Understood.
-[Meade] This isn't some

02:35.489 --> 02:38.426
25-year-old blind patriot
who you just wind up and point.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.461
This is an experienced officer

02:40.561 --> 02:43.163
trained as a freethinker,
used to being in command.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.698
So be careful.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.166
Be careful of taking that
away from her,

02:46.300 --> 02:49.837
or you'll manifest
the very thing

02:49.970 --> 02:51.405
that concerns you.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.242
Got it.

02:56.009 --> 02:57.811
Now, if you'll excuse me,

02:57.911 --> 03:00.080
I'm gonna go look
for a 25-year-old blind patriot

03:00.180 --> 03:02.983
that I can wind up
and point directly at her.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.159
[Joe]
I just left the office.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.094
We got to find a handler
for our pilot.

04:21.194 --> 04:22.696
[Kyle chuckles]
Well, you got six on your team

04:22.763 --> 04:24.097
to choose from, so--

04:24.197 --> 04:27.100
I'm not putting my team
in that situation.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.303
I need a shadow.
You know what I mean?

04:29.437 --> 04:31.939
-That's not very nice.
-Neither was lying to us.

04:32.039 --> 04:35.509
I'm not getting burned on some
fucking dirt runway in Jalisco.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.278
Yeah, I can think
of better ways to go.

fucking kidding me.

Yeah, well, something happened.

of money laundering in 2021,

pled down to 18 months
with a suspended sentence.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.341
There's a TSC file.
Want me to look at it?

this fucking prick for a ride.

06:58.686 --> 07:00.521
Okay, you want to clue me in
on the plan here?

I'm gonna put this fucker
in a bar ditch.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.627
Yeah, or we could go
with the plan that doesn't

07:06.727 --> 07:08.562
-put us on the news.
-All right.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.498
-We box him.
-Fine.

Well, Special Agent Gutierrez,

07:54.508 --> 07:55.643
you have some fucking
explaining to do.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.377
I got explaining to do?

07:59.012 --> 08:02.115
What the fuck is the CIA doing
wandering all over the border

08:02.182 --> 08:03.984
like it's fucking Syria?

08:04.084 --> 08:05.953
You have drones
buzzing around like hornets,

08:06.019 --> 08:08.689
you have strike teams
taking over airplane hangars

08:08.789 --> 08:11.525
on a decommissioned runway?

08:12.960 --> 08:15.829
Why don't you take an ad out
in a fucking newspaper?

08:15.929 --> 08:17.397
Only thing
you didn't bother doing

08:17.497 --> 08:20.000
is telling us you're there.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.334
Or why.

08:21.434 --> 08:24.204
So, what, so you start tailing
a senior case officer?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.773
Who gave you that order, huh?

08:25.873 --> 08:28.441
And you'd better hope
it was some senior fucking agent

08:28.508 --> 08:30.544
and not some bagman in Juárez.

08:31.845 --> 08:34.682
Order came from DOJ.

08:34.782 --> 08:36.950
How's that for fucking senior?

08:39.019 --> 08:41.755
You want to get that gun
out of my fucking neck?

08:42.923 --> 08:46.026
Yeah, real, real, real
low profile, guys.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.562
Thought you're supposed to be
a covert organization.

08:48.662 --> 08:49.663
Surprised you didn't show up

08:49.763 --> 08:52.165
with the Army's
fucking marching band.

08:52.232 --> 08:56.369
Whatever it is you think
you're doing on the border,

08:56.469 --> 08:58.205
you'd better
fill me the fuck in.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.743
Maybe we don't want
the world to know.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.345
World already knows.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.748
Believe me, if we know,
cartels sure as fuck know.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.184
You think you have satellites?

09:11.251 --> 09:13.887
One call to Beijing,
and there's a camera on you

09:14.021 --> 09:15.455
everywhere you fucking go.

09:17.190 --> 09:20.628
We're supposed to be
on the same fucking team.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.231
In my business,

09:24.331 --> 09:26.499
we don't put surveillance
on our teammates.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.902
You think this is surveillance?

09:29.002 --> 09:31.238
Following you two cars back?

09:32.305 --> 09:35.108
This is cover, honey.

09:35.208 --> 09:36.877
You're not dealing with some

09:36.944 --> 09:39.546
pedophile zealots who live
in the desert who think

09:39.647 --> 09:41.114
they're gonna get
a roomful of virgins

09:41.214 --> 09:42.783
when they blow themselves up.

09:43.784 --> 09:47.487
These fucking monsters
control an entire continent

09:47.587 --> 09:49.456
and the top third
of another one.

09:49.556 --> 09:50.691
They'll just show up

09:50.758 --> 09:53.093
to a fucking sheriff's house

09:53.226 --> 09:54.962
with a million in cash,

09:55.062 --> 09:57.164
and he has a choice.

09:57.264 --> 10:00.367
Take the money,
or watch them impale

10:00.433 --> 10:02.803
his nine-year-old on a rake,

10:02.903 --> 10:06.273
hang his wife
from a fucking bridge.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.976
They're in every
major city in America,

10:09.109 --> 10:10.110
they've infiltrated

10:10.243 --> 10:13.180
every state
and federal agency we have.

10:15.582 --> 10:18.251
Hey, hey.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.654
You think they kidnapped that
congresswoman for no reason?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.057
They kidnapped her

10:24.124 --> 10:26.193
because she said no.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.731
That's who you're fucking with.

10:30.798 --> 10:33.133
You think you can
do this on your own?

10:33.266 --> 10:34.902
Best of luck.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.670
Change the locks
on your fucking house.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.007
Not that it'll make
a fucking difference.

10:40.140 --> 10:41.374
And one more thing.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.077
Once I swap out
this fucking car,

10:44.144 --> 10:45.578
I'm gonna keep following you,

10:45.679 --> 10:47.781
so when they
snatch you from the street

10:47.848 --> 10:49.616
like fucking luggage...

10:51.484 --> 10:53.220
...we'll have a puncher's chance

10:53.320 --> 10:55.522
of getting to you
before they torture

10:55.655 --> 10:57.825
every secret we got out of you.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.359
-Is that right?
-Or better yet,

10:59.492 --> 11:01.128
you can clue me in.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.662
[both laugh]

11:02.796 --> 11:05.498
I've been doing this
for 20 fucking years.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.535
I am the file

11:08.635 --> 11:11.071
you can't check out

11:13.907 --> 11:16.676
We're wheels up out of Simmons

11:16.777 --> 11:18.511

11:18.645 --> 11:21.448
That's, uh, 6 a.m., amigo.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.117
I know what the fuck that means.

everything about you.

This isn't acute, Neal.

-[Neal] I said complete.

There's one in Georgetown.

12:57.610 --> 12:58.879

Get the patient prepped

-Did you see a DNR

17:36.556 --> 17:38.125
I'd offer you
something to drink,

17:38.258 --> 17:39.859
but that would indicate
I want you to stay.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.661

Saw it on the news.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.377
Nice work.

18:16.028 --> 18:16.829
Who went down?

18:16.929 --> 18:18.198
Nobody.

18:19.166 --> 18:22.269
I'm inserting a double.
I need a shadow.

18:22.369 --> 18:24.471
A close contact to protect her.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.639
Intervene if she flops.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.541
It's not enough I kill
a foreign national for you,

18:28.641 --> 18:29.776
now you want me to kill
a fucking agent?

18:29.842 --> 18:31.244
Hey, I'm real sorry
there are no more Germans

18:31.344 --> 18:32.545
for you to fight,

18:32.645 --> 18:35.648
no villains with lightning bolts
on their uniforms

18:35.715 --> 18:38.818
to make you feel like a hero
when you kill them.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.354
As I recall,
your brother died in prison.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.922
Your boyfriend killed.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.957
Both drug dealers.

18:46.293 --> 18:47.560
Where'd those drugs come from?

18:47.660 --> 18:48.995
'Cause they're not making
that shit in Berlin.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.930
They're not trucking it
by the metric ton

18:51.030 --> 18:52.632
up the Hudson fucking River.

18:52.699 --> 18:56.869
You spent the last 90 days
on the bow of a ship

18:56.969 --> 18:59.105
killing pirates.

18:59.206 --> 19:01.908
Do you feel good about that?

19:02.909 --> 19:06.279
I bet you racked up
the kills, too, didn't you?

19:08.147 --> 19:12.685
How many fathers did you kill
on this tour, Sergeant?

19:12.752 --> 19:16.723
Wait, it's Sergeant
First Class, right?

19:16.823 --> 19:18.225
'Cause you killed
so many fathers,

19:18.325 --> 19:19.359

You got thousands of operators
to choose from.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.079
No, I don't.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.315
I have a few hundred
Tier One operators in the Army

19:42.415 --> 19:43.783
and a few hundred more
in the Navy.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.353
You got eight SEAL teams
to choose from

19:46.453 --> 19:48.120
and fuck knows
how many Green Berets--

19:48.255 --> 19:49.889
You know what I mean.

19:49.989 --> 19:53.460
In our world there's Blue and
there's Green, and that's it.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.194
You're in one of them,
and you're the only one

19:55.262 --> 19:56.596
who understands what I do.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.432
Boy, am I--

19:59.566 --> 20:01.734
I don't need
your fucking permission.

20:01.801 --> 20:03.470
I can just have you
reassigned to my team.

20:04.537 --> 20:05.838
Then why are you fucking asking?

20:07.039 --> 20:09.141
I don't know
if I can trust this girl.

20:12.144 --> 20:14.647
I hope I can. I need to.

20:14.781 --> 20:16.583
But I know that I can trust you.

20:16.683 --> 20:20.052
Because you put mission
above all else:

20:20.119 --> 20:23.290
conscience, love, everything.

20:23.390 --> 20:27.527
Because the mission is worthy
and executing it saves lives.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.297
Is that what you do?

20:31.964 --> 20:33.400
You a lifesaver now?

20:34.401 --> 20:37.570
How many mosques in Paris
have blown up since Amrohi?

20:40.940 --> 20:42.842
You did that.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.712
You... did that.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.581
And if you didn't know it
somewhere deep down,

20:48.681 --> 20:49.716
you would have discharged

20:49.816 --> 20:51.150
and applied
to some police academy.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.185
Instead you're here.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.454
In a unit.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.723
Because you believe.

20:58.991 --> 21:00.527
What's her cover?

21:02.028 --> 21:03.530
She doesn't have one.

21:04.764 --> 21:09.035
Her father is a money launderer,
best we can tell,

21:09.135 --> 21:11.471
and her uncle runs distribution

21:11.538 --> 21:13.440
for one of the three cartels
that control Mexico

21:13.506 --> 21:16.275
and most of Central America.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.111
She flies birds for 1st Cav.

21:19.178 --> 21:21.481
And we're expecting her
to do the same for the cartels.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.784
She has one lie...

21:24.851 --> 21:28.054
that her discharge was
dishonorable.

21:29.221 --> 21:30.990
And you what?

21:31.057 --> 21:33.292
You expect this woman
to turn in a family member

21:33.360 --> 21:34.694
or eliminate one?

21:34.794 --> 21:36.062
I do.

21:36.162 --> 21:38.130
And I'm expecting you to do it
if she won't.

21:38.230 --> 21:39.732
Right.

21:39.866 --> 21:42.902
She has TS clearance.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.404
Think of all she knows.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.606
All she can fucking give them
if someone doesn't

21:46.706 --> 21:49.342
go there and point her
downrange.

21:49.442 --> 21:52.712
How many people did you kill
for this fucking country, huh?

21:52.845 --> 21:54.213
Afghanistan. In the Gulf.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.282
How many made a difference?

21:56.383 --> 21:59.819
How many altered
the landscape of geopolitics?

22:00.853 --> 22:02.822
I'm giving you
the chance at another.

22:02.922 --> 22:06.092
And if that isn't the reason
why you're an operator,

22:06.225 --> 22:08.160
I don't know
what you're doing here.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.596
I do it for the challenge.

22:09.729 --> 22:14.233
If what you want is a challenge,
go fight in the fucking UFC.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.637
No.

22:19.105 --> 22:20.640
No, you believe.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.744
[sighs] Even when it breaks you,
you believe.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.713
And I see it
'cause I'm the same.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.615
And it breaks me, too.

22:30.917 --> 22:32.819
And I still do it.

22:34.387 --> 22:37.590
I said I was out. I'm out.

22:39.091 --> 22:41.461
Choose someone else.

22:46.298 --> 22:48.668
That ship has sailed.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.604
I don't have time to teach
anybody how we work.

What is with
the hostility, Bobbo?

24:59.331 --> 25:01.601
I can handle you telling me
shit I already know.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.002
I really can.
[scoffs]

25:03.102 --> 25:06.472
I can even handle
your fucking sprint

25:06.573 --> 25:08.608
towards type 2 diabetes.
I just can't

25:08.675 --> 25:10.009
handle it all
at the same fucking time.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.210
Camera four, please.

25:17.650 --> 25:18.685
Nice, Tex.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.052
You said every room.

25:20.152 --> 25:21.854
[Two Cups]
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

25:21.954 --> 25:23.956
[Two Cups and Tex laughing]

25:29.862 --> 25:31.764
[Josie]
I thought I was going in today.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.299
They told us to hold up.

25:33.432 --> 25:35.267
I told my father today.

25:35.334 --> 25:38.504
Well, I doubt it's the first
time you've lied to him.

25:38.638 --> 25:40.339
It would be, actually.

25:41.473 --> 25:42.842
Okay, well, give him a call.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.577
Tell him the flight was delayed.

25:44.677 --> 25:46.445
-Text him.
-When do I say I'm getting in?

25:46.512 --> 25:48.514
Wait, no,
don't-don't send a text.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.382
Let me check on this.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.058
Damn.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.328
You sure piled up the kills.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.196
[Josie]
Yeah, well...

26:04.296 --> 26:06.232
I wouldn't bet
that number in Vegas.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.968
-You saying it's off?
-I'm saying, who knows?

26:09.068 --> 26:10.837
I hit a convoy in Peshawar once,

26:10.937 --> 26:12.705
driving old Russian BMPs.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.340
An ODA spotted them.

26:14.473 --> 26:16.142
Thirty trucks moving
two regiments.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.777
Got cleared to engage.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.545
Put 71 Hydras in them

26:19.679 --> 26:21.781
and then strafed 'em
with another 30

26:21.881 --> 26:23.249
till nothing was moving.

26:24.283 --> 26:27.453
Army called it 500 KIAs
in 30 seconds.

26:27.553 --> 26:29.789
But that's army math.

26:29.856 --> 26:31.624
Nobody counted them.

26:31.724 --> 26:33.926
That's just a colonel taking
a big guess in his favor.

26:37.329 --> 26:39.031
[laughing]

26:39.131 --> 26:40.900
Holy shit.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.369
That's some cold-ass shit
right there.

26:43.502 --> 26:45.872
Tell me there's a sexier sound
on the planet

26:46.005 --> 26:47.974
than an Apache
running up your six

26:48.040 --> 26:49.075
while you're pinned
behind a rock

26:49.175 --> 26:50.309
with your dick in your hand.

26:50.409 --> 26:53.813
Fucking pilots. Fucking pilots.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.848
[chuckles]

26:55.948 --> 26:58.550
That wasn't my dick.
That was my rifle.

26:58.685 --> 27:01.854
Popping fuckers until
you show up with the AC on high

27:01.954 --> 27:04.423
and Metallica blaring
in the background.

27:04.556 --> 27:05.858
Call sign's Thunder.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.627
Want us to call you Thunder?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.463
You want to call me Thunder?

27:13.700 --> 27:16.568
Okay. That's enough
psyops for me.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.405
[clears throat]
Who's hungry?

27:20.907 --> 27:22.074
He's camp chef.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.575
Can't wait to see what gruel

27:23.676 --> 27:24.977
-he cooks up.
-[Tucker chuckles]

27:25.077 --> 27:27.680
Nah, he's from New Orleans.

27:27.747 --> 27:29.148
That boy can cook.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.384
So, if you flew Apaches,

27:32.451 --> 27:34.386
you're rated to fly
anything beneath them.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.354
I can fly anything.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.690
-Fixed wing?
-Anything.

27:37.790 --> 27:40.459
You got a fixed wing or a helo
preference for moving cargo?

27:41.761 --> 27:45.331
Airbus CH135 is a pretty
bulletproof helo.

27:45.431 --> 27:47.533
For fixed wing,
can't beat King Air.

27:47.633 --> 27:50.602
Common, easy to find parts,
don't stand out.

27:50.703 --> 27:53.305
See, now you're thinking
like a team player.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.574
I just want to get back
to my unit.

27:55.641 --> 27:58.444
The sooner we get this over
with, the sooner that happens.

28:00.212 --> 28:01.580
Look.

28:02.749 --> 28:04.917
I don't blow smoke,

28:05.017 --> 28:07.386
and we don't do secrets.

28:07.453 --> 28:09.889
Once you leave white side,
there's...

28:09.989 --> 28:11.490
there's no going back.

28:12.458 --> 28:13.826
So you could fly
for Ground Branch,

28:13.926 --> 28:16.195
you could fly for Green or Blue,

28:16.295 --> 28:17.897
but you ain't hitting
any more convoys

28:17.964 --> 28:19.398
in battle.

28:20.166 --> 28:22.534
You're in the gray now.

28:24.636 --> 28:25.872
Come on.

28:25.972 --> 28:27.940
Let's see what's for dinner.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.809
* dramatic music *

28:30.076 --> 28:32.011
***

28:43.389 --> 28:45.391
[light piano music playing]

28:46.959 --> 28:47.927
[hostess]
Hello. Welcome in.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.695
[phone buzzing]

28:49.829 --> 28:51.964
Oh, you got to take it outside.

28:52.031 --> 28:53.165
I know the deal.

28:53.299 --> 28:54.166
[hostess]
Sorry.

28:54.300 --> 28:57.036
[Joe]
I just walked in.

28:57.169 --> 28:58.437
[Kyle over phone]
Our new best friend at the DEA

28:58.537 --> 28:59.772
just gave us a snack.

28:59.872 --> 29:00.840
A snack?

29:00.940 --> 29:03.075
Warehouse 30 miles south
of the border.

29:03.175 --> 29:04.143
What does he want?

29:04.210 --> 29:05.978
Wants us to hit it.

29:07.013 --> 29:09.015
We don't even know this guy.

29:09.115 --> 29:10.850
Well, we'll take him with us.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.084
Kyle,

29:12.184 --> 29:14.353
this reeks of setup.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.522
Let me talk to Kaitlyn
about this.

29:16.622 --> 29:18.057
I already checked in.
They said go.

29:18.190 --> 29:19.291
"Partner" doesn't mean

29:19.358 --> 29:21.627
informing me after
you've made a decision.

29:21.693 --> 29:23.562
Create a problem
and then offer a solution.

29:23.695 --> 29:24.997
Wasn't that the plan?

29:25.097 --> 29:26.298
That's the plan.

29:26.365 --> 29:28.634
All right, well,
this is creating that problem.

29:28.734 --> 29:30.169
My team is in Dallas.

29:30.236 --> 29:31.637
I need 'em on the road.

29:31.737 --> 29:33.639
They're with the asset.

29:33.739 --> 29:36.308
Yeah, asset's a pilot.
Need one of those, too.

29:39.912 --> 29:42.714
This doesn't happen without me.
You understand?

29:50.656 --> 29:51.723
[hostess]
Welcome back.

29:56.362 --> 29:57.463
Enjoy.

30:01.767 --> 30:03.702
We're trusting
local law enforcement now?

30:03.802 --> 30:04.904
[Westfield chuckles]

30:05.004 --> 30:08.140
DEA isn't local law enforcement,
number one.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.342
Number two,
the agent who reached out

30:10.442 --> 30:12.244
spent six years on an SRT team.

30:12.344 --> 30:14.413
He is elite, and he knows
what's being asked

30:14.546 --> 30:16.182
when he climbs
in the ring with us.

30:16.282 --> 30:19.151
Elite? That clown was following
me like a rookie carjacker.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.186
He wanted you to spot him.

30:20.252 --> 30:21.453
Well, everybody else
spotted him.

30:21.553 --> 30:23.622
The car may as well have been
painted paisley.

30:23.722 --> 30:26.425
Joe, this is no different
from Iraq or Afghanistan

30:26.525 --> 30:28.427
or any other war
for that matter.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.762
Every branch wants
their piece of the pie.

30:30.863 --> 30:33.365
They want their medals
and their promotions

30:33.465 --> 30:34.200
-and their increase in funding.
-Mm-hmm.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.601
That's what they really want.

30:35.734 --> 30:38.004
[Westfield] In this instance,
it's agencies

30:38.104 --> 30:40.406
and not military branches.

30:40.472 --> 30:41.540
And we're gonna have
to grease the wheels,

30:41.607 --> 30:42.774
or they will kick and scream

30:42.875 --> 30:45.711
until the operation itself
is in jeopardy.

30:45.811 --> 30:47.579
Just better to bring 'em in
from the beginning.

30:47.679 --> 30:49.781
Anyone else besides me want to

30:49.882 --> 30:51.783
factor in the results
of this operation:

30:51.884 --> 30:54.220
lives saved, human dignity,

30:54.320 --> 30:56.288
national sovereignty,
any of that shit?

30:56.388 --> 30:57.589
Don't be naive, Joe.

30:57.689 --> 30:59.258
That's me being naive?

30:59.358 --> 31:01.493
The reason we bring you in
for missions of this sort

31:01.593 --> 31:03.462
is specifically because
those are your goals.

31:03.562 --> 31:05.264
[scoffs]

31:05.331 --> 31:07.934
DEA's annual budget
is $3 billion dollars, Joe.

31:08.034 --> 31:09.735
FBI is 11.

31:09.801 --> 31:11.337
Department of Homeland Security?

31:11.470 --> 31:13.906
$103 billion dollars,

31:14.006 --> 31:16.808
60.7 billion of which
is discretionary.

31:16.909 --> 31:19.145
Nobody but you
is factoring lives

31:19.245 --> 31:21.780
or dignity or sovereignty
into the equation.

31:21.847 --> 31:24.650
They are factoring
a ten percent budget increase

31:24.750 --> 31:25.817
into their equation.

31:25.918 --> 31:28.620
To believe anything else
is naive

31:28.720 --> 31:30.322
and it's extremely dangerous,

31:30.422 --> 31:31.490
because the moment
you become the reason

31:31.590 --> 31:32.691
they don't need a bigger budget,

31:32.824 --> 31:34.426
the bull's-eye shifts to you.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.662
You throw them bones
everywhere you can.

31:36.762 --> 31:37.796
Just don't let those bones

31:37.863 --> 31:40.132
land anywhere near
your actual mission.

31:40.199 --> 31:42.468
They want to play Special Forces
with some hitters,

31:42.568 --> 31:43.936
get their hands dirty, day one?

31:44.003 --> 31:45.537
[scoffs]

31:45.637 --> 31:48.307
Seems like
a pretty good idea to me.

31:48.407 --> 31:50.009
Did you talk to our sergeant?

31:50.109 --> 31:51.843
I did.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.445
[Meade]
She on board?

31:53.512 --> 31:55.181
If you want to call it that.

31:55.281 --> 31:56.682
I want you to call it that.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.850
If anyone needs to be drinking
the same Kool-Aid as you,

31:58.985 --> 32:00.086
it's her.

32:00.186 --> 32:01.420
She's the one thing between us

32:01.520 --> 32:03.755
and a segment on 60 Minutes.

32:04.656 --> 32:07.859
Been there before, hasn't she?

32:07.960 --> 32:10.629
Are you aware of what
they lined up for us tonight?

32:10.729 --> 32:11.830
Yeah.

32:11.897 --> 32:14.666
Just give them
the whole dog and pony show.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.736
He serves warrants.
He's not a soldier.

32:17.869 --> 32:18.971
[Westfield]
He's a soldier tonight.

32:19.071 --> 32:21.440
[Joe]
No, he's not.

32:21.540 --> 32:24.776
But he's a witness.
Food for thought.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.693
* slow, solemn music *

32:41.960 --> 32:44.096
***

32:58.910 --> 33:00.879
You said all my gear.

33:01.947 --> 33:04.050
Forget how much shit
you guys always travel with.

33:05.851 --> 33:07.986
All right, let's work
this puzzle out.

33:08.054 --> 33:10.356
* driving, purposeful music *

33:10.622 --> 33:12.824
***

33:37.949 --> 33:39.085
Did you miss me?

33:39.218 --> 33:40.319
This asshole.

33:40.419 --> 33:42.154
Hundred bucks,
he just got a manicure.

33:43.722 --> 33:44.956
You know this guy?

33:45.057 --> 33:46.892
[Bobby]
Nope.

33:46.992 --> 33:48.260
But I know her.

33:48.394 --> 33:49.695
What do you make of that?

33:49.761 --> 33:51.097
She's geared up.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.431
Team ready?

33:52.564 --> 33:53.899
[Bobby]
Yeah, we're ready.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.001
Don't know what we're ready for,
but we're ready.

33:56.068 --> 33:57.569
[Gutierrez]
How you guys doing?

33:57.669 --> 33:59.505
Good. Just out here
playing Uber.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.240
You don't mind if I get in?

34:01.340 --> 34:02.274
[Bobby]
Why not?

34:02.408 --> 34:04.443
-Bobby, give me a second.
-Yeah.

34:07.346 --> 34:09.380
Looks like you've been
running and gunning.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.083
Just go where I'm sent.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.551
They got you in Orange, huh?

34:13.585 --> 34:16.722
-Green.
-No shit?

34:16.788 --> 34:18.489
No shit.

34:19.791 --> 34:22.293
You'll be used
to our old showers, then.

34:22.393 --> 34:24.963
You guys keeping it old-school
out here in the desert?

34:25.097 --> 34:26.532
Something like that.

34:26.598 --> 34:30.469
You know, you can only shoot one
of these guys at a time, right?

34:30.569 --> 34:32.971
Yeah, well, I like options.

34:39.478 --> 34:41.280
Welcome back.

34:44.150 --> 34:45.817
[engine starts]

34:54.659 --> 34:56.628
[Bobby]
We got thermal images?

34:56.728 --> 34:58.597
[Tex]
There's your overwatch.

34:58.697 --> 35:01.032
-[Joe] Any images inside?
-[Gutierrez] No.

35:01.133 --> 35:02.768
What do we expect
to find in there?

35:02.868 --> 35:04.002
[Gutierrez]
Typically, these warehouses

35:04.136 --> 35:06.905
are used as, uh, staging areas.

35:06.972 --> 35:08.474
They load contraband

35:08.607 --> 35:10.742
for land routes, tunnels.

35:10.842 --> 35:12.478
More than likely retrofitted
these vehicles here

35:12.611 --> 35:15.314
for drug compartments
based on the number

35:15.447 --> 35:16.582
of vehicles parked outside.

35:16.648 --> 35:17.549
They bring 'em in,

35:17.649 --> 35:19.151
build out the compartments,

35:19.251 --> 35:20.686
load 'em back up,

35:20.786 --> 35:21.920
and then they ship 'em out.

35:22.020 --> 35:24.490
Juárez, Nuevo Laredo,

35:24.590 --> 35:26.024
wherever they try to cross.

35:26.158 --> 35:28.460
And how much contraband
can we expect to find?

35:28.527 --> 35:31.230
Don't know. We catch 'em
prepping for a large amount

35:31.330 --> 35:33.399
of crossings,
could be substantial.

35:33.499 --> 35:35.167
You don't have
constant surveillance?

35:35.301 --> 35:37.836
So, we share this satellite
with HSI

35:37.936 --> 35:39.805
-and BP.
-Great.

35:39.905 --> 35:42.208
So you don't have a fucking clue
of what's in there.

35:42.341 --> 35:43.309
How old are these images?

35:43.375 --> 35:44.843
Last month.

35:44.943 --> 35:47.513
Oh. Wonderful.

35:47.613 --> 35:50.482
[Gutierrez]
Sorry. Our ATM card has a limit.

35:50.549 --> 35:53.252
You got coordinates
for this fucking warehouse?

35:57.189 --> 35:59.391
Bravo, Victor, Papa,

35:59.525 --> 36:02.160
2-5-5-0-niner to authenticate.

36:02.261 --> 36:03.695
Coordinates to follow.

36:03.795 --> 36:06.465
One-three,
Romeo, Charlie, Romeo,

36:13.405 --> 36:15.207
-[sighs]
-[Kyle] Oh, shit.

36:15.307 --> 36:17.409
Looks a lot different

36:17.543 --> 36:18.710
-present-day, don't it?
-What a fucking joke.

36:18.810 --> 36:21.146
Y'all plan ops
around outdated images.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.382
And you wonder why we're losing
the war on drugs.

36:23.515 --> 36:24.516
[Two Cups laughs]

36:25.984 --> 36:27.553
[Bobby]
Ruh-roh.

36:27.653 --> 36:30.922
All right, so air takes us in.
Do we get air support

36:31.022 --> 36:32.224
-while we're in there?
-It's supposed to look

36:32.358 --> 36:34.260
like a rival cartel,
not military.

36:34.393 --> 36:37.296
Well, the rival cartel
looks outnumbered.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.598
That's the problem, Bobby.

36:39.731 --> 36:41.567
What's the solution?

36:41.667 --> 36:44.703
-[Tracer] If I may.
-I... Oh, God, of course.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.374
Could you zoom out
just a little bit?

36:50.309 --> 36:53.178
We infil half of the team here.

36:53.245 --> 36:56.948
We run .300 subsonic.
Take overwatch from the rear.

36:57.082 --> 36:58.684
Can we use a Predator?

36:58.750 --> 37:00.452
Why would we use a Predator?

37:01.420 --> 37:02.621
We make a mess
of this parking lot.

37:02.721 --> 37:05.791
While Bravo Team enters
from the left flank,

37:05.924 --> 37:07.793
Alpha Team moves up.

37:07.893 --> 37:10.195
Bravo Team, explosive breach.

37:10.262 --> 37:13.299
Enter northeast, southwest.

37:13.432 --> 37:16.568
Really fucking easy.
Two teams of five.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.304
We get compromised,
Little Bird comes in hot

37:18.437 --> 37:19.938
-and gets us out.
-Can I just fucking be

37:20.071 --> 37:22.474
the voice of reason here
for just one second?

37:22.608 --> 37:24.075
Here we go.

37:24.175 --> 37:26.445
So, if we're under JSOC,

37:26.578 --> 37:28.547
why don't we just fly
three assault teams out,

37:28.614 --> 37:30.816
make short work of it?
Why the fucking stretch?

37:30.949 --> 37:32.017
[Joe]
You know the deal, Bobby.

37:32.117 --> 37:34.586
They want minimal risk
with maximum reward.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.688
Well, three teams
is minimum risk.

37:36.788 --> 37:38.290
[Joe]
That's not how they see it.

37:38.424 --> 37:41.460
They think the more we commit,
the more potential for failure.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.161
Well, that's because they've
never been in a gunfight, Joe.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.096
[Joe]
One hundred percent.

37:45.163 --> 37:47.265
Can you jam cell signals?

37:48.300 --> 37:51.069
-Can I what?
-[Joe] Fucking hell.

37:51.136 --> 37:53.405
I'm good with this.

37:55.441 --> 37:57.676
[sighs]
We own the night.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.611
We have eyes. They don't.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.447
You think they don't.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.014
Gear up.

38:18.464 --> 38:19.531
No radio?

38:20.699 --> 38:24.002
Stay below the hard deck.
There's no need for radio.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.237
Okay, so we're just
gonna fucking wing this.

38:30.108 --> 38:32.978
Alpha Team infil,
Bravo Team infil.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.279
Exfil is on the target.

38:34.346 --> 38:36.548
If we call for CAS,

38:36.682 --> 38:38.450
we will mark the target with IR
and talk you in.

38:38.550 --> 38:40.386
-My weapons are hot.
-Your weapons are hot.

38:40.519 --> 38:42.388
Do I have radio contact
with Command?

38:42.488 --> 38:44.723
There is no Command.

38:44.856 --> 38:45.991
I am Command.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.459
This is fucking insane.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.294
We had a 20-minute briefing.

38:49.361 --> 38:51.363
Welcome to the CIA.

38:51.463 --> 38:53.098
Let's go.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.176
-Hold above target.
-What altitude?

39:38.243 --> 39:39.845
Twenty-five hundred.

39:39.945 --> 39:41.980
They'll hear me.

39:43.014 --> 39:45.083
We want them to.

41:57.583 --> 41:59.851
Running sirens.
Moving in our direction.

Get eyes on.

They're in place.

Vehicles approaching
from the west.

Police vehicles. Three.

Fuck. Federal or state?

How would I know that?

-What color?
-It's night.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.333

Are they sedans
