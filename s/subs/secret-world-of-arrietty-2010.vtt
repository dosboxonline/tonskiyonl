he's just a child.

They worked on that house together
for hours.

but of course, they never did.

50:46.753 --> 50:48.922
(EXCLAIMS) A cricket leg!

50:50.298 --> 50:51.842
- Want some?
-(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

50:51.925 --> 50:53.885
- Very fresh.
- No, thanks.

50:58.849 --> 51:00.058
Bye.

51:01.226 --> 51:02.811
Thank you, my friend.

51:06.147 --> 51:08.191
I'll go with him. To see him out.

51:14.281 --> 51:17.242
What were you doing out there
in that storm?

51:17.868 --> 51:20.287
I was looking for a safe route
for our journey.

51:20.370 --> 51:22.372
And now I know which route not to take.

51:22.455 --> 51:23.832
Oh, Pod.

51:24.165 --> 51:27.669
Spiller knows of more Borrowers
a few days journey away.

51:28.545 --> 51:30.755
There's a small river past the forest.

51:30.839 --> 51:32.507
He's offered to take us on it.

51:33.008 --> 51:34.843
Mmm. That's great.

51:36.469 --> 51:39.514
I'm sure we'll find a new place in no time.

51:40.432 --> 51:44.144
And I'm sure
it will almost be as nice as this.

51:48.398 --> 51:50.233
I'm really glad I met you, Spiller.

51:50.317 --> 51:51.651
Or that I met anyone.

51:52.193 --> 51:54.696
Hey, maybe next time you could bring
your whole family with you.

51:55.363 --> 51:58.033
No family. Only Spiller.

51:58.533 --> 51:59.951
Oh.

52:00.035 --> 52:01.786
Well, we... We could be a family.

52:01.870 --> 52:04.414
And when you come back
you could stay for a family dinner.

52:04.497 --> 52:05.707
(GRUNTS)

53:09.938 --> 53:11.231
Hara?

53:29.791 --> 53:32.919
Arrietty, your stitches need to be
closer together.

53:33.003 --> 53:34.462
You'll have to start over.

53:34.546 --> 53:35.880
Aw!

53:36.631 --> 53:38.633
Why do we need
such a big bag anyway?

53:38.717 --> 53:40.719
Are we putting the whole house in here?

53:45.974 --> 53:47.225
Hmm.

53:48.184 --> 53:51.104
I think I'm gonna go check on Papa.

53:51.813 --> 53:52.981
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

53:53.064 --> 53:55.608
- Papa, can I come in?
- Mmm-hmm.

53:57.861 --> 54:00.989
- How's your leg?
- Ah, well, better than that cricket's.

54:01.072 --> 54:02.407
I'm serious.

54:06.077 --> 54:07.787
Papa, why do we have to move?

54:08.913 --> 54:12.584
Once a Borrower has been seen,
the beans' curiosity can't be stopped.

54:16.337 --> 54:20.008
Well, isn't it possible that
not every human bean is dangerous?

54:21.384 --> 54:24.220
Arrietty, before you were born

54:24.304 --> 54:27.807
there were two other families
who were living in this house.

54:28.224 --> 54:31.311
One family went missing,
they just disappeared.

54:31.394 --> 54:33.605
The other one moved away.

54:33.688 --> 54:35.398
They were seen by humans.

54:35.482 --> 54:39.527
And so, we have to do
whatever it takes to survive.

54:40.653 --> 54:41.946
But, Papa...

54:42.030 --> 54:43.323
(LOUD CRASHING)

54:50.288 --> 54:51.498
Oh! Oh, no!

54:55.001 --> 54:56.127
Huh?

54:57.712 --> 55:01.424
Pod, what is it? An earthquake?

55:01.966 --> 55:03.176
(EXCLAIMING)

55:09.724 --> 55:11.392
(SCREAMING)

55:26.074 --> 55:27.325
Mother!

55:29.202 --> 55:31.955
(GRUNTING) It won't open!

55:34.415 --> 55:37.043
(GRUNTING) Frame is buckled!

55:59.399 --> 56:00.650
The wall!

56:33.266 --> 56:34.559
(GASPS)

56:36.895 --> 56:38.188
Homily!

56:39.939 --> 56:41.357
Homily, are you all right?

56:42.275 --> 56:46.654
Pod, remember how I always said
I wanted a new kitchen?

56:54.954 --> 56:56.331
-(DOOR OPENS)
- Huh?

57:07.550 --> 57:10.053
Huh, more bills.

57:16.809 --> 57:18.061
(SIGHS) Oh.

57:20.521 --> 57:21.689
Hmm.

57:33.910 --> 57:35.161
Hmm.

57:38.206 --> 57:39.374
Hmm.

57:42.043 --> 57:43.044
(GASPS)

57:44.045 --> 57:45.213
Hmm.

57:52.095 --> 57:54.389
Remember,
take only the things we need.

57:54.472 --> 57:55.682
Mmm-hmm.

58:02.063 --> 58:04.232
We can't possibly carry all of this.

58:05.149 --> 58:08.903
And, Homily,
don't take anything from the dollhouse.

58:10.613 --> 58:13.032
I'm gonna go make sure that it's safe.

58:13.741 --> 58:16.369
- You stay with your mother.
- Okay.

58:48.484 --> 58:50.069
So you finally came.

59:00.204 --> 59:02.832
Did you like your new kitchen?

59:04.792 --> 59:07.003
Well, our house looks like a train wreck.

59:09.130 --> 59:12.216
But it doesn't matter.
Because I came to tell you goodbye.

59:17.305 --> 59:18.973
Can I turn around?

59:21.684 --> 59:23.102
Mmm-hmm.

59:26.230 --> 59:27.482
(MEOWING)

59:43.122 --> 59:44.749
You're beautiful.

59:47.835 --> 59:49.754
My papa said we have to move now.

59:52.215 --> 59:54.092
We've been seen,

59:54.175 --> 59:56.386
and Borrowers
aren't supposed to be seen.

59:56.928 --> 59:58.429
What are Borrowers?

59:58.513 --> 1:00:00.932
My mother, father,
and I are all Borrowers.

1:00:01.015 --> 1:00:03.393
We borrow things that beans
won't miss if they are gone.

1:00:04.018 --> 1:00:06.938
Just little things,
soap, cookies, and sugar.

1:00:07.021 --> 1:00:09.107
All things that we need to survive.

1:00:09.190 --> 1:00:11.275
Even my great-grandfather
was a Borrower.

1:00:12.527 --> 1:00:14.779
I think my grandfather saw
one of you once.

1:00:14.862 --> 1:00:16.906
Hmm. It's possible.

1:00:19.992 --> 1:00:21.869
And it's my fault that you're leaving.

1:00:22.203 --> 1:00:24.372
-(HISSING)
- Niya! Niya!

1:00:24.455 --> 1:00:27.166
Don't be like that. Be nice to her.

1:00:28.167 --> 1:00:29.460
So, in my aunt's house,

1:00:29.544 --> 1:00:32.338
how many other Borrowers
are there who are living with you?

1:00:33.256 --> 1:00:36.634
It's just my father and my mother
and me.

1:00:37.051 --> 1:00:38.719
What about in other houses?

1:00:38.803 --> 1:00:40.221
I'm sure there are some.

1:00:40.304 --> 1:00:42.974
But I've only met one other so far.

1:00:43.558 --> 1:00:44.767
Oh.

1:00:46.018 --> 1:00:49.313
You must be afraid you'll be
the only ones of your kind who are left.

1:00:49.397 --> 1:00:50.731
What?

1:00:50.815 --> 1:00:53.401
Every year there's
fewer and fewer of you, right?

1:00:53.985 --> 1:00:57.280
Aren't you scared
that soon you'll all be gone?

1:00:59.240 --> 1:01:01.117
What a horrible thing to say!

1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:04.662
I know that there's more of us
because Spiller said so!

1:01:05.288 --> 1:01:06.664
Who's Spiller?

1:01:06.747 --> 1:01:09.667
He's one of us. He lives out in the forest,

1:01:09.750 --> 1:01:12.879
and he said that
there are hundreds more of us.

1:01:13.546 --> 1:01:14.964
That might be true.

1:01:15.047 --> 1:01:17.842
But, you know,
none of us can live forever, can we?

1:01:20.094 --> 1:01:22.430
We all have to die sometime.

1:01:23.097 --> 1:01:25.057
Why would you say something like that?

1:01:25.975 --> 1:01:27.602
Because it's true.

1:01:28.019 --> 1:01:29.729
I guess so.

1:01:30.188 --> 1:01:32.773
Believe me,
I know what I'm talking about.

1:01:33.232 --> 1:01:37.278
Sometimes things happen to us
that are just beyond our control.

1:01:39.113 --> 1:01:40.698
And when these things happen,

1:01:40.781 --> 1:01:43.075
there's really nothing
you can do about it.

1:01:43.784 --> 1:01:46.496
You just accept it
and prepare for the worst.

1:01:48.039 --> 1:01:49.749
I wish it wasn't that way.

1:01:49.832 --> 1:01:53.127
But you can't live a life
that's built on nothing but wishes.

1:01:54.295 --> 1:01:56.297
It isn't practical.

1:01:56.380 --> 1:01:59.300
Sometimes you just have to
accept the hand of fate.

1:01:59.842 --> 1:02:01.969
(EXHALES) Oh, no, you don't.

1:02:02.803 --> 1:02:05.264
Sometimes you have to stand up
and fight

1:02:05.348 --> 1:02:07.475
for the things that are worth fighting for.

1:02:08.601 --> 1:02:11.562
You have to survive.
That's what my papa says.

1:02:11.646 --> 1:02:14.649
And so we're leaving
even though it's dangerous.

1:02:15.274 --> 1:02:17.568
And we are going to survive.

1:02:17.652 --> 1:02:21.030
We are Borrowers and we'll make do.
We always have.

1:02:21.113 --> 1:02:24.492
As long as we have each other to live for,
we'll keep on living.

1:02:26.994 --> 1:02:30.164
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you.

1:02:31.332 --> 1:02:33.626
I'm actually the one who's going to die.

1:02:34.126 --> 1:02:35.503
What?

1:02:38.589 --> 1:02:40.550
There's something wrong with my heart.

1:02:40.633 --> 1:02:42.635
They're gonna operate next week

1:02:43.052 --> 1:02:44.762
but it probably won't help.

1:02:44.845 --> 1:02:46.264
That's terrible.

1:02:48.641 --> 1:02:51.811
I've always been sick
and I've had someone looking after me.

1:02:52.812 --> 1:02:54.605
And that's why when I saw you,

1:02:54.689 --> 1:02:57.525
I just wanted to find a way to protect you.

1:02:57.608 --> 1:03:00.236
But I guess I messed up.

1:03:00.319 --> 1:03:02.613
I made it worse. I'm sorry.

1:03:04.532 --> 1:03:07.159
And I'm sorry to hear about your heart.

1:03:14.041 --> 1:03:15.251
Hmm.

1:03:25.553 --> 1:03:26.721
Hmm?

1:03:31.267 --> 1:03:33.936
Now what on earth is this doing here?

1:03:34.562 --> 1:03:35.771
Hmm.

1:03:38.065 --> 1:03:39.400
Mmm-hmm.

1:04:00.046 --> 1:04:03.924

aren't there, hmm?

Could you get out here right away?

1:09:08.395 --> 1:09:11.440
I have a very unique pest problem.

- Is <i>it mice?</i>
- Oh, much worse than mice.

1:09:15.235 --> 1:09:17.154
<i>Do you want them exterminated?</i>

1:33:30.147 --> 1:33:32.691
<i>I like you, I don't care</i>

1:33:32.775 --> 1:33:35.903
<i>Why did it have to end?</i>

1:33:37.196 --> 1:33:40.199
<i>Summer love with my best friend</i>

1:33:40.282 --> 1:33:45.454
<i>I'd fly to you
All the way across the states</i>

1:33:45.538 --> 1:33:49.959
<i>I'd fly to you
Hear me, the winter day</i>

1:33:50.042 --> 1:33:56.549
<i>Oh, I'd follow the sun
and come right to your door</i>

1:33:58.217 --> 1:34:00.678
<i>I remember my summer with you</i>

1:34:00.761 --> 1:34:03.389
<i>Cherry popsicles, sand in my toes</i>

1:34:03.472 --> 1:34:06.600
<i>Rolled down windows
Hold my hand, hold me close</i>

1:34:06.684 --> 1:34:11.021
<i>Pick up your phone
Wanna hear your voice again</i>

1:34:11.105 --> 1:34:14.400
<i>Like a fresh air, like a windblown hair</i>

1:34:14.483 --> 1:34:17.027
<i>I like you, I don't care</i>

1:34:17.111 --> 1:34:20.197
<i>Why did it have to end?</i>

1:34:21.740 --> 1:34:25.077
<i>Summer love with my best friend</i>

1:34:26.871 --> 1:34:29.999
<i>I will miss you in summer again when</i>

1:34:37.423 --> 1:34:40.134
<i>I will miss you in summer again when</i>
