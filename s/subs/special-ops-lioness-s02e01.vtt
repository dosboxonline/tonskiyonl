37:16.843 --> 37:18.758
Good.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.544
Good.

37:31.379 --> 37:33.163
[sighs]

37:36.863 --> 37:38.952
You weren't kidding.

37:41.084 --> 37:43.173
"Beware of the old soldier."

37:44.914 --> 37:46.959
- [sighs]
- Yeah.

37:46.960 --> 37:49.136
We still have our uses.

37:51.660 --> 37:53.053
You want one?

37:54.359 --> 37:56.360
I don't smoke.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.145
Yeah.

37:59.059 --> 38:01.191
Neither do I.

38:05.021 --> 38:06.588
I'm sorry about Dean.

38:09.548 --> 38:11.984
You know, of all...

38:11.985 --> 38:13.639
the shit we got into...

38:15.554 --> 38:16.946
...it weren't no bullet
that got him.

38:18.470 --> 38:21.036
Or IED
or some fucking helo crash,

38:21.037 --> 38:23.212
or any of the other shit
out there, nope.

38:23.213 --> 38:25.302
It's just...

38:25.303 --> 38:27.305
chose to climb
in the back of a Suburban.

38:29.916 --> 38:32.004
But that's war, you know?

38:32.005 --> 38:33.833
- Can't make no sense of it.
- No.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.359
Are you sticking around
for this deal?

38:40.100 --> 38:41.622
Yeah, they usually
only send me in

38:41.623 --> 38:43.624
when the deal gets
real fucked up.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.497
But...

38:45.584 --> 38:47.063
[exhales]

38:47.150 --> 38:49.369
...if you fuck up the deal,

38:49.370 --> 38:51.241
I'll come a-runnin'.

38:51.329 --> 38:53.287
Be lucky to have you.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.855
At least you can offset
the level of fucking dipshit

38:56.856 --> 38:59.423
- that comes with this Ken doll.
- [laughs]

38:59.424 --> 39:02.644
Go easy on ol' spy Barbie, there.

39:04.951 --> 39:06.604
Hey, motherfucker.

39:06.605 --> 39:09.084
[grunts]

39:09.085 --> 39:10.477
[Kyle chuckles]

39:10.478 --> 39:12.305
Ah.

39:12.306 --> 39:13.916
That was your one free shot.

39:14.003 --> 39:15.961
I'll take my fucking chances.
[grunts]

39:15.962 --> 39:18.267
[screams] Fuck!

39:18.268 --> 39:20.835
Goddamn it, Joe.

39:20.836 --> 39:22.925
Shit. [sighs]

39:23.012 --> 39:24.665
I have a fucking family.

39:24.666 --> 39:26.101
[exhales]

39:26.102 --> 39:27.712
We go kamikaze
through the desert

39:27.713 --> 39:29.366
with no fucking plan.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.671
- You almost got us killed!
- No fucking plan?

39:30.672 --> 39:32.847
We just executed
the fucking plan, Joe!

39:32.848 --> 39:33.935
And it worked.

39:33.936 --> 39:34.980
She's back.

39:34.981 --> 39:36.503
And we're a man down.

39:36.504 --> 39:38.505
Man down is the price.

39:38.506 --> 39:40.420
And we all signed up to pay it.

39:40.421 --> 39:41.683
[laughs]

39:42.771 --> 39:44.642
When's the last time
you were in a firefight?

39:44.643 --> 39:47.253
Huh?

39:47.254 --> 39:49.690
And I'm not talking
about some bimbo's bodyguard.

39:49.691 --> 39:52.041
- Fuck you!
- I mean a fucking battle.

39:53.173 --> 39:54.348
It's been a while, hasn't it?

39:55.305 --> 39:56.654
I'll tell you what.

39:56.655 --> 39:58.177
[laughs]

39:58.178 --> 39:59.700
I'll give you another one.

39:59.701 --> 40:00.919
You need an adrenaline dump,

40:00.920 --> 40:03.095
fucking dump it right here.

40:03.096 --> 40:05.532
We're working together now.

40:05.533 --> 40:08.056
You want to do
some fucking cowboy shit,

40:08.057 --> 40:09.928
you do it on your own.

40:09.929 --> 40:12.147
Never fucking do it
with my team.

40:12.148 --> 40:14.455
You know what I would be doing
if I were you?

40:14.542 --> 40:16.718
[laughs] I ca--
I can't wait to hear this.

40:17.719 --> 40:20.635
I'd be calling
that family you got.

40:24.944 --> 40:26.771
You're right.

40:26.772 --> 40:28.643
That's exactly
what I should be doing.

40:35.824 --> 40:37.172
- That should be enough.
- [Kate] It's sticky.

40:37.173 --> 40:39.218
- You just, like, spread it all--
- [phone buzzing]

40:39.219 --> 40:41.655
It's not sticking
to the pan, Dad.

40:41.656 --> 40:42.962
Hey.

40:43.049 --> 40:44.833
[Joe]
<i>Hey.</i>

40:44.920 --> 40:46.182
You okay?

40:46.269 --> 40:47.575
Yeah.

40:48.620 --> 40:50.448
<i>Rough day at the office, huh?</i>

40:53.189 --> 40:55.278
You can say that.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.240
Are the girls there?

41:00.327 --> 41:01.980
<i>- Can I talk to them?</i>
- Yeah.

41:01.981 --> 41:03.155
Yeah, uh, which one?

41:03.156 --> 41:04.939
<i>Just put me on speaker.</i>

41:04.940 --> 41:06.550
[girls talking quietly]

41:06.551 --> 41:08.160
It's falling apart.

41:08.161 --> 41:10.467
Girls, it's your mother.

41:10.468 --> 41:12.295
- [Charlie] <i>Hi!</i>
- [Kate] <i>Hi, Mom.</i>

41:14.820 --> 41:16.648
[Kate]
<i>Mom, are you okay?</i>

41:17.910 --> 41:19.345
[inhales deeply]

41:19.346 --> 41:21.043
[exhales]

41:21.130 --> 41:22.915
Hi, baby. I'm fine.

41:24.133 --> 41:24.960
<i>I'm good.</i>

41:26.222 --> 41:27.223
[Kate]
Are you sure?

41:28.181 --> 41:30.618
I'm...
[sniffles]

41:30.705 --> 41:32.185
I'm great, I'm great.

41:32.272 --> 41:34.012
How are you?

41:34.013 --> 41:35.231
We're making supper.

41:35.318 --> 41:36.798
<i>Oh, yeah, what's for supper?</i>

41:36.885 --> 41:38.320
Pizookie.

41:38.321 --> 41:40.280
<i>A what?</i>

41:40.367 --> 41:41.846
[Neal]
<i>Well, Mom,</i>

41:41.847 --> 41:43.891
<i>you take a whole batch
of cookie dough</i>

41:43.892 --> 41:46.024
<i>and you spread it out
in an iron skillet.</i>

41:46.025 --> 41:49.071
<i>And it makes a cookie
the size of a pizza.</i>

41:49.158 --> 41:50.158
<i>A pizookie.</i>

41:50.159 --> 41:51.420
[sniffles]

41:51.421 --> 41:53.858
That sounds... healthy.

41:53.859 --> 41:55.468
- [laughs]
- [Charlie] <i>It is</i>

41:55.469 --> 41:57.252
if you have ice cream with it.

41:57.253 --> 41:59.299
They make ice cream out of milk.

41:59.386 --> 42:01.213
<i>Boy, do they have you
trained, baby.</i>

42:01.214 --> 42:03.129
Oh, yeah, I'm aware.

42:04.304 --> 42:06.784
I sure wish I could have some.

42:06.785 --> 42:08.656
[Kate]
<i>You can.</i>

42:08.743 --> 42:10.571
<i>- When are you coming home?</i>
- [sniffling]

42:14.053 --> 42:16.402
Soon, baby.

42:16.403 --> 42:18.536
Soon.

42:22.278 --> 42:24.323
I love you.

42:24.324 --> 42:25.890
<i>- Love you.</i>
- [Charlie] <i>Love you, too.</i>

42:25.891 --> 42:27.674
- [Neal] <i>Love you, Mom.</i>
- [Charlie] <i>Bye-bye.</i>
