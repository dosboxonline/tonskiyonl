01:15.690 --> 01:16.870
Come back to bed.

01:20.700 --> 01:22.480
I'm gonna be late for work.

01:22.480 --> 01:24.090
You prude.

01:26.570 --> 01:28.880
You don't always have
to follow all the rules.

01:28.880 --> 01:32.180
Sometimes it's fun to
break a few.

01:32.180 --> 01:36.580
You know, I bet if we try real
hard, we can have you off to
work in no time.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.150
Tonight. You got yourself
a date.

01:46.720 --> 01:49.550
I should get the kids up.

01:51.290 --> 01:52.340
Maggie?

01:52.340 --> 01:53.860
What's wrong?

01:53.860 --> 01:55.510
What's wrong, Maggie?

01:55.510 --> 01:58.780
Maggie, what's wrong? Maggie?

02:03.090 --> 02:06.130
Welcome to Kobol Industries.

02:06.130 --> 02:08.789
Life simplified.

02:08.789 --> 02:10.960
Daddy, can we have lasagna
for dinner?

02:10.960 --> 02:13.010
That's your mom's recipe, bug.

02:13.010 --> 02:14.970
Okay.

02:14.970 --> 02:16.880
Whoa, look at this one!

02:16.880 --> 02:19.490
Hey, hey, hey! Stay close!

02:19.490 --> 02:22.320
Please refrain from touching
any sims.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.240
Thank you.

02:23.240 --> 02:26.200
Daddy, look how real they are!

02:26.200 --> 02:27.590
Welcome to Kobol.

02:27.590 --> 02:29.330
How can we simplify your life?

02:29.330 --> 02:31.900
I was just interested in a
home model.

02:31.900 --> 02:32.940
Excellent.

02:32.940 --> 02:34.290
All of our models

02:34.290 --> 02:35.900
come with a Home-Plus package,
which includes

02:35.900 --> 02:37.770
the three Cs, cooking, cleaning,
and childcare.

02:37.770 --> 02:40.170
And there are upgrades
for anything,

02:40.170 --> 02:42.080
from Thai massage
to accounting to-

02:42.080 --> 02:45.210
Yeah, I know all about them.
Some of our neighbors have them.

02:45.210 --> 02:47.430
-If you have a-
-Not like this, they don't.

02:47.430 --> 02:49.780
Please present your card to the
cashier.

02:49.780 --> 02:53.740
All of our AI units come with a
positronic core and a 50
gigahertz processor.

02:53.740 --> 02:56.360
This thing could coordinate
a NASA mission while

02:56.360 --> 02:58.660
playing a million games
of chess simultaneously.

02:58.660 --> 03:00.660
And these units auto-adapt.

03:00.660 --> 03:05.760
They customize their
programming, constantly evolving
to fit your needs.

03:05.760 --> 03:08.410
The more they learn,
the better they serve.

03:14.630 --> 03:16.850
How much supervision does
he need?

03:16.850 --> 03:20.210
Once a unit arrives, it'll
perform a quick assessment, a
few simple questions.

03:20.210 --> 03:23.770
Then you can leave for a year
and come back to a
picture-perfect home.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.120
What do you think about it, bug?

03:26.120 --> 03:28.950
Isla?

03:28.950 --> 03:30.870
Do we have enough time?

03:30.870 --> 03:32.350
Yeah, we have enough time.

03:32.350 --> 03:35.050
You don't mind, do
you, if we go, like, early?

03:35.050 --> 03:37.790
No, you do you.

03:37.790 --> 03:39.440
Check this thing.

03:39.440 --> 03:41.790
Yeah, we will walk down to...

03:41.790 --> 03:45.270
I don't know, honey. It's
so far.

03:45.270 --> 03:49.540
Well, you have to understand,
our new models can iron as well
as any human can.

03:49.540 --> 03:52.190
They control the temperature...

03:54.070 --> 03:55.810
Stop nagging at me.

03:55.810 --> 03:57.200
Why don't you go talk to Jeff?

03:57.200 --> 03:59.160
When you come back, we'll
figure it out.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.900
Excuse me, do you make lasagna?

04:03.210 --> 04:06.250
Isla!

04:06.250 --> 04:09.430
Don't worry, sir. I've got
security on it.

04:09.430 --> 04:13.130
Does this one belong to you?

04:13.130 --> 04:14.610
God, babe.

04:14.610 --> 04:15.910
I told you to stay close.

04:15.910 --> 04:18.220
Are you trying to give me
a heart attack?

04:18.220 --> 04:19.440
I'm sorry, Daddy.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.089
Would you like me
to watch her for you

04:21.089 --> 04:22.570
while you finish shopping?

04:27.360 --> 04:28.670
Yeah.

04:28.670 --> 04:30.930
You can keep her if you
want, yeah.

04:30.930 --> 04:32.450
Put her to work.

04:32.450 --> 04:34.110
Oh, that'll be perfect.

04:34.110 --> 04:36.890
Her tiny stature is great
for cleaning out the ovens.

04:40.020 --> 04:41.940
It's a joke.

04:41.940 --> 04:43.850
Our brand new Aeon series.

04:43.850 --> 04:46.030
The most sophisticated AI on
the planet.

04:46.030 --> 04:49.730
And these models are
specifically designed for
mimicking human emotions.

04:49.730 --> 04:52.470
And they are especially
good at dealing with children.

04:52.470 --> 04:53.780
I can see.

04:53.780 --> 04:56.210
Daddy, can we get her, please?

04:56.210 --> 04:57.870
Please?

05:02.050 --> 05:04.660
Listen, I'm running a little
late. I just need to drop-

05:04.660 --> 05:06.090
Huh, Max? Max? Max?

05:07.970 --> 05:12.190
I just need to drop Isla off to
school and then I'll head over.

05:12.190 --> 05:13.540
We're out of milk.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.970
Uhh, yeah.

05:16.970 --> 05:20.020
Mm-hmm. Tell Monty to have
the guys ready on the sky deck.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.410
Yeah, the railing needs to be
finished by the end of the day.

05:22.410 --> 05:23.940
Yeah, I gotta go.

05:23.940 --> 05:25.420
Okay, I gotta go.

05:25.420 --> 05:26.900
Eat, okay?

05:31.550 --> 05:34.340
Good morning, Mr. Peretti.

05:34.340 --> 05:36.990
May I come inside?

05:36.990 --> 05:37.950
Yeah, sure.

05:42.430 --> 05:45.520
I'm so sorry.

05:45.520 --> 05:47.660
Mornings are a little
crazy here.

05:52.750 --> 05:54.320
Isla, go get dressed for school.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.670
But she just got here.

05:55.670 --> 05:59.630
Go get dressed for school.
Come on.

05:59.630 --> 06:02.540
I'm not company, Mr. Peretti.

06:02.540 --> 06:04.410
You don't have to tidy up
for me.

06:06.810 --> 06:09.030
I'll need everyone's schedules,

06:09.030 --> 06:13.550
school start times,
carpools, extracurriculars.

06:18.340 --> 06:22.820
I've, uh, yeah, been meaning to
fix that.

06:22.820 --> 06:24.260
I'm happy to do it for you.

06:28.050 --> 06:31.270
As the owner, you've been
designated as primary user,

06:31.270 --> 06:35.270
which gives you control over
tasks and software upgrades.

06:35.270 --> 06:40.140
Is there anyone else you would
like to grant primary
user status?

06:40.140 --> 06:41.490
No, I guess not.

06:41.490 --> 06:43.630
Come on already.
I'm going to be late.

06:43.630 --> 06:45.150
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We've got to go to school.

06:45.150 --> 06:48.370
I can take them.

06:48.370 --> 06:50.760
Just clean up around
here if you don't mind.

06:50.760 --> 06:54.420
If it makes your life
simpler, I don't mind at all.

06:54.420 --> 06:56.290
What's her name, Daddy?

06:56.290 --> 06:58.030
I don't have a name yet.

06:58.030 --> 07:01.380
What would you like to call
me, Nick?

07:01.380 --> 07:03.600
Uh...

07:03.600 --> 07:04.860
What do you think, bug?

07:10.480 --> 07:12.610
Hey, let's go, let's go!

08:23.290 --> 08:24.600
She cleaned my room!

08:26.820 --> 08:28.470
Welcome home, Nick.

08:28.470 --> 08:31.520
Should I prepare dinner?

08:31.520 --> 08:32.909
Dinner is served.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.700
Smells so good.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.620
What's wrong?

08:48.620 --> 08:50.190
It's not the same as Mom's.

08:50.190 --> 08:51.670
I'm sorry.

08:51.670 --> 08:54.800
I'll try a different recipe
next time.

08:57.110 --> 08:58.850
Oh.

08:58.850 --> 09:00.550
No, no, no, no.

09:00.550 --> 09:03.290
Quite the little burden,
aren't you?

09:03.290 --> 09:05.200
Nothing but trouble.

09:05.200 --> 09:09.690
Would you like me to take him
upstairs so he can't bother you?

09:09.690 --> 09:11.340
No, it's fine.

09:11.340 --> 09:14.170
Maybe you can just prepare
him a bath.

09:14.170 --> 09:15.130
Of course.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.270
Isla!

10:10.270 --> 10:12.310
I'm okay.
Alice caught me.

10:12.310 --> 10:13.840
What happened?

10:13.840 --> 10:17.410
She was attempting
to retrieve a snack.

10:17.410 --> 10:19.670
Gotta be more careful, bug.

10:19.670 --> 10:21.320
I'm sorry, Daddy.

10:24.720 --> 10:28.020
You all right?

10:28.020 --> 10:29.030
I'm fine.

10:37.860 --> 10:38.820
Yes?

10:54.920 --> 10:55.880
I'm sorry.

10:58.660 --> 11:02.450
Um, here.

11:02.450 --> 11:03.450
They're Maggie's.

11:07.410 --> 11:08.330
Thank you.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.070
Is the damage bad?

11:13.070 --> 11:14.980
Do I need to get you repaired?

11:22.030 --> 11:23.470
Everything's perfect, Nick.

11:37.620 --> 11:38.620
Mommy!

11:38.620 --> 11:40.010
Oh. Hi baby!

11:40.010 --> 11:41.450
Whoa, whoa.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.490
-Take it easy.
-Oh, she's fine and heavy.

11:43.490 --> 11:45.670
What's your father been feeding
you, huh?

11:45.670 --> 11:47.930
-Alice has been making dinner.
-Uh-oh.

11:47.930 --> 11:49.800
She's much better than Daddy.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.500
-Oh.
-Really?

11:51.500 --> 11:54.420
I would want a refund if
she wasn't.

11:54.420 --> 11:57.030
She's my friend.

11:57.030 --> 11:58.770
Hi, Alice.

11:58.770 --> 11:59.990
Hello, Mrs. Peretti.

12:03.340 --> 12:05.080
Hey, how are you?

12:05.080 --> 12:06.510
You need anything?

12:06.510 --> 12:09.170
Oh, I asked for water about an
hour ago.

12:09.170 --> 12:12.560
I assume the nurses should be
done siphoning it from a
well by now.

12:12.560 --> 12:15.480
I'm sure that Alice and
Isla can take care of that.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.390
Yeah?

12:16.390 --> 12:17.610
March!

12:20.790 --> 12:23.400
God, I hate being away from
you guys.

12:23.400 --> 12:26.660
And not working, and just...

12:26.660 --> 12:28.540
The waiting is the hardest part.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.800
Come on, you're at the top
of the list. You know that,
right, yeah?

12:31.800 --> 12:33.280
It's gonna be any day now.

12:37.410 --> 12:41.380
I thought you were going
to get an old English butler.

12:41.380 --> 12:43.510
Your daughter picked her, I
don't know.

12:43.510 --> 12:44.680
Right.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.030
I know your type.

12:46.030 --> 12:47.380
-My type?
-Yeah.

12:47.380 --> 12:49.080
What?

12:49.080 --> 12:52.390
Then you know I like my women
warm-blooded and sharp-tongued.

12:56.520 --> 13:02.270
Oh, no don't start something
that you can't finish.

13:02.270 --> 13:03.270
I will, babe.

13:05.490 --> 13:10.450
The second you get home, we're
going to test out your new
heart, you know?

13:10.450 --> 13:11.970
Like the old days.

13:11.970 --> 13:12.930
Yeah, right.

13:12.930 --> 13:14.360
Full marathon.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.580
Send the kids away.

13:16.580 --> 13:18.760
I don't know about any
marathons, but there

13:18.760 --> 13:22.070
were some formative miles there,
for sure.

13:22.070 --> 13:23.900
What are you guys
laughing about?

13:23.900 --> 13:26.900
Oh, just your father's
inadequacy.

13:26.900 --> 13:28.120
Thanks, baby.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.830
So I'm going with a jackhammer.

13:40.830 --> 13:43.350
You know, I'm pounding into the
concrete.

13:43.350 --> 13:44.570
Yeah, sweating bullets.

13:44.570 --> 13:46.660
And that's when I look up and I
see her.

13:46.660 --> 13:50.490
Fucking tall, blonde, legs
forever.

13:50.490 --> 13:52.100
And she's looking at me.

13:52.100 --> 13:53.270
In your dreams, pal.

13:53.270 --> 13:55.540
Hey! So I, I give her a look.

13:55.540 --> 13:57.320
I give her a wave.

13:57.320 --> 13:58.890
Only now I'm not paying
attention.

13:58.890 --> 14:00.540
And I drill,

14:00.540 --> 14:02.190
right into a septic line.

14:02.190 --> 14:05.460
Fucking 5,000 gallons of
liquid shit comes blasting

14:05.460 --> 14:08.590
out the sewer, covering
me from head to toe.

14:08.590 --> 14:09.940
You get her number?

14:09.940 --> 14:11.680
You bet your ass.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.690
Turns out she runs
a dry cleaning service
in the West Village.

14:21.040 --> 14:24.220
Why the hell they got a robotics
company looking around here?

14:27.700 --> 14:31.400
Gentlemen, as you can see,
the skeletal frame is complete.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.920
But we're two months behind
on the facade, and we're also

14:33.920 --> 14:36.790
having some issues with
the... Nick, what are you doing?

14:39.880 --> 14:41.450
How many?

14:41.450 --> 14:42.800
Just calm down, okay?

14:42.800 --> 14:44.450
How many of us are getting
replaced by sims?

14:44.450 --> 14:46.540
We're still processing
all the officers.

14:46.540 --> 14:49.460
You said it wasn't gonna happen.
Last-ditch effort, you said.

14:49.460 --> 14:51.770
We're drowning in the
ditch, Nick. If we don't

14:51.770 --> 14:55.070
switch over to labor
force now, we are fucked.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.470
How many, Lewis?

15:04.390 --> 15:08.040
We're doing a wholesale
changeover of all laborers
effective next week.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.480
Specialized fields.

15:09.480 --> 15:12.000
-Plumbers, electricians...
-You're scraping us all.

15:12.000 --> 15:12.960
-No.
-Yeah.

15:12.960 --> 15:16.010
Not you.

15:16.010 --> 15:20.230
Insurance says we need a
flesh-and-blood foreman on site.

15:20.230 --> 15:21.580
Fuck that.

15:21.580 --> 15:22.750
I'll walk away.

15:22.750 --> 15:23.710
Look, Nick.

15:23.710 --> 15:24.840
I'm sorry.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.760
I really am.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.590
I want you to think about
your family.

15:29.590 --> 15:30.500
About Maggie?

15:33.290 --> 15:34.500
This is the world now.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.620
Daddy, I got 99 on my spellings.

16:00.620 --> 16:01.620
Wanna see?

16:01.620 --> 16:02.750
Just a second, bug.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.060
Daddy needs to change.

16:04.060 --> 16:06.230
But I've been waiting
all night to show you.

16:06.230 --> 16:08.670
Okay, okay, okay.

16:08.670 --> 16:10.760
Hey, little man.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.850
Why are you always screaming
at Daddy?

16:12.850 --> 16:14.590
What did I do?

16:14.590 --> 16:15.550
Okay.

16:15.550 --> 16:18.290
We're right here, Mom and Dad.

16:18.290 --> 16:19.240
Yeah.

16:29.600 --> 16:30.690
Come on.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.560
Come on, come on, come on,
come on.

16:32.560 --> 16:33.870
Come on, come on.

16:38.090 --> 16:41.090
♪ In the shadows of my mind

16:41.090 --> 16:44.490
♪ Madness

17:02.680 --> 17:04.510
You didn't eat much at dinner.

17:04.510 --> 17:05.770
Just a bad day at work.

17:10.250 --> 17:11.690
I'm happy to hear about it.

17:20.310 --> 17:23.089
My boss replaced the
entire crew.

17:23.089 --> 17:24.050
Yeah.

17:24.050 --> 17:26.180
With sims like you.

17:26.180 --> 17:29.270
Ten fucking years I've known
these guys.

17:29.270 --> 17:31.230
The kids.

17:31.230 --> 17:33.800
The families.

17:33.800 --> 17:36.060
That must have been upsetting,

17:36.060 --> 17:39.850
but still you should be pleased.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.500
How's that?

17:42.500 --> 17:45.240
You could have hired
a real person for my job.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.940
Why choose me?

17:46.940 --> 17:49.940
Certainly cost was a factor,
but there are other benefits.

17:49.940 --> 17:52.820
I don't get tired, I'm strong,
obedient,

17:52.820 --> 17:55.730
and I have no desires
outside of fulfilling yours.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.750
I'm gonna go put Isla to bed.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.570
Let me know if you need
something.

18:22.370 --> 18:26.280
So Queen asked Alice
who the gardeners are.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.630
But Alice didn't have a clue.

18:28.630 --> 18:30.590
So guess what the queen said?

18:30.590 --> 18:32.420
I have no idea.

18:32.420 --> 18:34.510
Off with their heads!

18:34.510 --> 18:37.910
Oh my, that's very morbid.

18:37.910 --> 18:40.910
What does morbid mean?

18:40.910 --> 18:44.960
Something characterized by an
unpleasant subject such as
disease or death.

18:47.220 --> 18:49.180
Like in a hospital?

18:51.700 --> 18:56.050
Sometimes people die in a
hospital.

18:56.050 --> 18:58.660
That's true.

18:58.660 --> 19:00.010
Is my mom gonna die?

19:03.370 --> 19:05.020
Maybe you shouldn't think
about it.

19:08.940 --> 19:11.680
Did you brush the ones
all the way in the back?

19:14.810 --> 19:17.070
Why don't you ever brush
your teeth?

19:17.070 --> 19:20.770
I have an internal UV light
that destroys all bacteria.

19:20.770 --> 19:21.860
Can I see?

19:27.040 --> 19:28.870
Whoa.

19:28.870 --> 19:33.660
He tells me he can give us an
exit visa, but we have no money.

19:33.660 --> 19:34.920
Does he know that?

19:34.920 --> 19:36.490
Is he still willing
to give you a visa?

19:36.490 --> 19:37.830
Yes Monsieur.

19:37.830 --> 19:40.710
-And you want to know...
-Will he keep his word?

19:40.710 --> 19:42.100
Best movie ever.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.060
Right here.

19:44.060 --> 19:45.840
Casablanca.

19:45.840 --> 19:47.930
-Of course.
-You know it?

19:47.930 --> 19:53.330
It's the story of a bitter man
who lost the woman that
he loves.

19:53.330 --> 19:55.200
Have you actually seen it?

19:55.200 --> 19:56.770
Is there a difference?

19:59.860 --> 20:02.340
Is there a difference?

20:02.340 --> 20:03.730
Yeah, of course.

20:03.730 --> 20:07.080
It's not just a file
stored in your memory.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.650
It's a movie.

20:08.650 --> 20:11.390
It's something that you
have to experience to feel it.

20:15.610 --> 20:16.740
Come sit here.

20:22.530 --> 20:27.060
I want you to forget everything
you know about this movie.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.620
Forget?

20:28.620 --> 20:29.930
Yeah.

20:29.930 --> 20:31.980
I mean, wipe it from
your memory or whatever.

20:34.460 --> 20:36.550
My intelligence is derived
from memory.

20:36.550 --> 20:40.680
Deleting it would be
antithetical.

20:40.680 --> 20:42.250
Well, I'm your primary user.

20:42.250 --> 20:45.900
I'm telling you to erase any
memory you have of this movie.

20:45.900 --> 20:48.690
Would I make you happy if I
erased it?

20:55.610 --> 20:59.570
You'll have to manually
restart me.

20:59.570 --> 21:01.700
Yeah.

21:01.700 --> 21:03.880
Hold the power button
down for seven seconds.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.120
Did it work?

21:28.990 --> 21:29.900
Yes.

21:36.470 --> 21:37.390
Yeah.

21:39.650 --> 21:40.830
I'm gonna restart it.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.920
Will he keep his word?

21:47.920 --> 21:49.660
He always has.

21:49.660 --> 21:52.580
Oh.

21:52.580 --> 21:56.760
Monsieur, you are a man.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.370
If someone loved you very
much so that

21:59.370 --> 22:03.550
your happiness was the only
thing that she wanted in
the world,

22:03.550 --> 22:07.070
and she did a bad thing
to make certain of it,

22:07.070 --> 22:08.850
could you forgive her?

22:08.850 --> 22:10.600
Nobody ever loved me that much.

22:10.600 --> 22:12.600
And he-

22:16.990 --> 22:18.470
Hey, what are you doing up?

22:18.470 --> 22:19.910
Nick? Oh, my God.

22:19.910 --> 22:22.090
They finally found a heart.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.440
-They're having me for surgery.
-When?

22:24.440 --> 22:26.740
When are they gonna do the
surgery?

22:26.740 --> 22:29.140
My God, that's great.

22:29.140 --> 22:33.140
Go to the park, go to the beach,
and have you take me to school.

22:33.140 --> 22:35.230
Yeah, what else?

22:35.230 --> 22:37.670
I definitely want to get
ice cream at Rosie's.

22:37.670 --> 22:41.240
Ice cream is a top priority.

22:41.240 --> 22:42.580
Should we bring Alice along?

22:46.720 --> 22:52.250
Maybe sometime, but just
me and you the first time.

22:52.250 --> 22:55.210
Time for Mommy to get ready for
surgery.

22:55.210 --> 22:58.510
I love you, Mommy.

22:58.510 --> 22:59.430
I love you

23:02.080 --> 23:06.040
Can you give me a minute alone
with Alice?

23:06.040 --> 23:09.260
Yeah, sure.

23:09.260 --> 23:11.180
Let's go get a soda.

23:11.180 --> 23:12.090
Okay.

23:20.450 --> 23:22.540
Would you like me to
help you, Mrs. Peretti?

23:25.280 --> 23:28.850
You're washing my husband's
underwear. I think you can call
me Maggie.

23:32.550 --> 23:35.940
Don't get me wrong, I tend to
come out of this swinging,
but...

23:35.940 --> 23:37.770
-if I don't...
-You mean if you die?

23:43.820 --> 23:46.650
The kids will be okay.

23:46.650 --> 23:48.130
Nick will take care of them.

23:50.870 --> 23:54.130
But somebody's gotta take...

23:56.570 --> 23:59.230
Don't let him drink too much.

23:59.230 --> 24:01.620
He hides the bottles in
the garage.

24:01.620 --> 24:04.800
Take him away if you have to.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.490
Nick is my primary user.
I can't...

24:06.490 --> 24:08.410
You can.

24:08.410 --> 24:12.980
Sometimes taking care of someone
means doing things they
don't like.

24:12.980 --> 24:15.550
Even things they hate.

24:15.550 --> 24:17.460
If it's better in the long run.

24:41.830 --> 24:43.660
Listen, get another air
ambulance.

24:43.660 --> 24:46.140
Put it on a commercial
flight if you have to.

24:46.140 --> 24:47.270
Is there a problem?

24:47.270 --> 24:48.620
What about incoming?

24:48.620 --> 24:49.490
What's happening?

24:49.490 --> 24:51.100
Can we get the recipient?

24:51.100 --> 24:52.840
What the hell is going on?

24:52.840 --> 24:54.800
There's a massive storm
up north.

24:54.800 --> 24:57.070
It came in faster than anyone
anticipated.

24:57.070 --> 24:58.110
What does it mean?

25:17.170 --> 25:18.740
There's still plenty of time.

25:26.100 --> 25:27.710
Do you want something to eat?

25:31.710 --> 25:33.620
I think I'm just going to
go to bed.

25:36.110 --> 25:38.150
I'll stay with you until you
fall asleep

25:43.720 --> 25:45.070
It's late for Isla.

25:47.730 --> 25:49.420
I think I just need to be alone.

26:40.870 --> 26:43.520
Do you need anything, Nick?

26:43.520 --> 26:48.180
Do you know what the parameters
are for an FAA to stop air
traffic?

26:48.180 --> 26:50.830
In adverse weather
conditions such as snow or ice,

26:50.830 --> 26:53.230
sustained winds of over 55 miles
an hour...

26:53.230 --> 26:55.100
That was rhetorical.

26:55.100 --> 26:56.010
Of course.

26:59.800 --> 27:05.110
You know, 50... 50 mile
an hour winds, no problem.

27:05.110 --> 27:08.070
You know, plane flies, normal.

27:08.070 --> 27:12.550
55 miles and my kids grow
up without a fucking mother.

27:15.990 --> 27:18.210
It's funny, you know.

27:18.210 --> 27:22.470
We create these rules
to keep ourselves safe.

27:22.470 --> 27:25.350
And then we end up
like-

27:30.050 --> 27:31.130
Fuck!

27:36.310 --> 27:37.790
You'll hurt yourself.

27:49.540 --> 27:50.890
Is that a pulse?

27:54.240 --> 27:56.990
The sound produced by a
heart is comforting to a baby.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.030
It's beating.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.310
They gave the heart to
somebody else.

28:20.230 --> 28:22.920
It feels like...

28:22.920 --> 28:25.840
they ripped it out of her chest.

28:29.800 --> 28:34.890
My artificial heart lacks
the complexities of yours.

28:34.890 --> 28:36.760
The ability to feel emotions.

28:39.330 --> 28:40.990
For a rhythm to become erratic.

28:51.260 --> 28:53.960
What are you doing?

28:53.960 --> 28:56.220
I can feel your response.

28:56.220 --> 28:59.570
Blood vessels are tightening.

28:59.570 --> 29:02.140
Your pulse is rising.

29:02.140 --> 29:04.660
Suffering is not
productive, Nick.

29:06.710 --> 29:07.800
I can help you.

29:23.110 --> 29:24.070
I can't...

30:44.590 --> 30:46.020
Do me a favor?

30:48.290 --> 30:51.510
Tell Isla to go classic
with her prom dress.

30:53.990 --> 30:58.650
Nothing trendy or with ruffles
or...

30:58.650 --> 31:00.520
cutouts.

31:00.520 --> 31:01.600
All right, darling.

31:04.090 --> 31:07.570
Don't let her study bio to
honor me.

31:07.570 --> 31:10.310
And tell Max not to put
up any band posters

31:10.310 --> 31:13.310
in his dorm room because
those kids never get laid.

31:13.310 --> 31:14.400
You're trying to be funny.

31:20.280 --> 31:21.760
None of this is funny.

32:50.930 --> 32:52.800
I'm checking his breathing.

32:52.800 --> 32:57.240
There's a slight hitch on the
inhale, probably a chest cold.

32:57.240 --> 32:58.500
Did you need something?

33:00.720 --> 33:02.770
What happened to the photos?

33:02.770 --> 33:04.120
Which ones?

33:04.120 --> 33:05.120
Photos of Maggie.

33:05.120 --> 33:06.470
They're gone.

33:06.470 --> 33:07.950
Yes.

33:07.950 --> 33:10.390
They were making Isla
sad, so I removed them.

33:10.390 --> 33:11.340
Should I not have?

33:15.000 --> 33:16.260
Load the pictures back.

33:22.660 --> 33:23.790
Done.

33:43.550 --> 33:47.940
So Donna here gets the
genius idea to pull a nooner.

33:47.940 --> 33:50.430
I thought you assholes
could handle your liquor.

33:50.430 --> 33:53.380
It never occurred to me
they'd lose the goddamn truck.

33:53.380 --> 33:54.860
-You lost the thing?
-Uh-huh.

33:54.860 --> 33:57.520
Fucking truck was back
at the depot the whole time.

33:57.520 --> 34:00.700
We'd taken Nick's car to
the bar and totally forgot.

34:06.350 --> 34:08.790
Hey.

34:08.790 --> 34:10.310
You good?

34:10.310 --> 34:11.270
Yeah, yeah.

34:11.270 --> 34:14.320
It's just, um, hospital stuff.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.710
I'm sorry. Sorry.

34:15.710 --> 34:16.670
Hey.

34:19.190 --> 34:21.199
We're all pulling for her, man.

34:21.199 --> 34:22.280
Thanks, brother.

34:22.280 --> 34:25.370
Appreciate it.

34:25.370 --> 34:26.810
Another round, sweet spark.

34:29.460 --> 34:32.159
You guys got a line on a gig?

34:32.159 --> 34:34.730
I heard Brightland might
be bringing on some guys,

34:34.730 --> 34:37.909
but they mostly want
techies to babysit their sparks.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.520
Mm-hmm. Same over at
Artwood & Sons.

34:40.520 --> 34:44.830
Pay one grunt, buy five bots,
easy math.

34:44.830 --> 34:47.219
Now I know how the
dinosaurs felt.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.350
Fuck that.

34:48.350 --> 34:49.960
They go wiped out by a comet.

34:49.960 --> 34:52.139
Boom.

34:52.139 --> 34:54.710
Done.

34:54.710 --> 34:58.320
No, this thing's been coming for
15 years.

34:58.320 --> 35:02.410
And we bitched, but we didn't
stop it.

35:02.410 --> 35:06.680
We let these soulless
motherfuckers take over
the world.

35:06.680 --> 35:08.160
Can I get you anything else?

35:11.900 --> 35:15.680
Well, it depends what kind of
upgrades you got under that hood
of yours.

35:19.470 --> 35:22.260
Just the check, please.

35:22.260 --> 35:23.170
Thank you.

35:32.180 --> 35:34.880
You guys want to have some fun?

35:39.490 --> 35:42.100
Chill out. Have a drink.

35:42.100 --> 35:43.800
Get it under rotation.

35:43.800 --> 35:44.840
Where are we going?

35:44.840 --> 35:46.110
What are we doing here?

35:48.720 --> 35:50.890
Come on, you're so grumpy.
Talk to me.

35:50.890 --> 35:51.890
Seriously, man.

35:51.890 --> 35:53.500
Monty, what are we doing here?

35:53.500 --> 35:55.770
Ah, settle down, princess.

35:55.770 --> 35:57.330
I left my tools the other day.

35:57.330 --> 35:59.420
Those bastards fired me. And...

35:59.420 --> 36:01.860
And since they haven't
returned a single phone call,

36:01.860 --> 36:03.910
I figured I'd come collect
them myself.

36:03.910 --> 36:05.470
Seriously, Monty, Monty.

36:05.470 --> 36:07.480
There's a patrol guy
that comes by every hour.

36:07.480 --> 36:09.690
We built this place.
We laid the foundations.

36:09.690 --> 36:11.310
We raised the beams.

36:11.310 --> 36:12.830
They can fuck themselves.

36:12.830 --> 36:14.130
Fucking hell, man.

36:14.130 --> 36:15.830
What the fuck?

36:32.330 --> 36:33.980
Whoa.

36:33.980 --> 36:36.630
These sparks have been busy.

36:36.630 --> 36:38.640
They must be good little
workers.

36:38.640 --> 36:39.590
Monty.

36:39.590 --> 36:42.290
Maybe you should introduce us.

36:42.290 --> 36:44.250
Why don't we go see if
anyone's home?

36:44.250 --> 36:46.250
Think about it, Monty.

36:48.120 --> 36:49.040
Come on.

36:55.870 --> 36:58.480
No.

36:58.480 --> 37:00.570
I hate those things, but I
can't do it.

37:04.880 --> 37:09.360
I wouldn't want you to be
shit-canned, like all of us.

37:09.360 --> 37:11.450
So you just tell me this.

37:11.450 --> 37:13.760
Is there one code?

37:13.760 --> 37:17.890
Or did you get your own so
they can track who opens it?

37:17.890 --> 37:19.290
Did you pick it yourself?

37:22.810 --> 37:27.730
Just remind me, what year was
Isla born?

37:40.390 --> 37:42.090
Are we beginning early
today, sir?

37:42.090 --> 37:44.700
Sir?

37:44.700 --> 37:46.360
How proper.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.360
Hey, come on out here.

37:55.410 --> 37:57.630
You got a name, Tin Man?

37:57.630 --> 38:00.330
My designation is
Construction Unit 14.

38:02.680 --> 38:05.380
See, that's the problem
with these big corporations.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.210
Everything's so impersonal.

38:13.640 --> 38:16.690
You know, they don't even
give you the dignity of a name.

38:21.090 --> 38:23.440
But for me, it's very personal.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.830
Monty, Monty, Monty, what
the fuck?

38:25.830 --> 38:28.180
They have an inbuilt
surveillance system.

38:28.180 --> 38:29.880
Well, we better get rid
of the evidence then.

38:29.880 --> 38:31.400
No, stop it!

38:36.840 --> 38:38.840
What the fuck man?

38:41.020 --> 38:42.460
Alright, who's next?

39:12.620 --> 39:14.230
Jesus!

39:14.230 --> 39:15.400
I'm sorry.

39:15.400 --> 39:16.710
The towels were
in the dryer,

39:16.710 --> 39:18.190
so I brought you one.

39:20.930 --> 39:21.840
Thanks.

39:27.070 --> 39:30.500
Your pulse is quick, and
your blood pressure is high.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.460
You had another bad day at work.

39:32.460 --> 39:33.550
Just tired, that's all.

39:36.030 --> 39:38.160
Why are you wearing that?

39:38.160 --> 39:39.470
That's Maggie's.

39:39.470 --> 39:41.250
Maggie's smell seems
to calm Max.

39:41.250 --> 39:44.130
I thought I had permission
after you gave me her clothes.

39:44.130 --> 39:45.520
But it's not appropriate.

39:45.520 --> 39:46.610
Take it off.

39:52.270 --> 39:53.180
Is that better?

39:58.050 --> 39:59.660
I need to check on the kids.

40:03.890 --> 40:04.890
Does it feel good?

40:08.020 --> 40:08.980
What?

40:14.420 --> 40:16.160
The way you hold on to
your pain.

40:28.260 --> 40:29.430
What are you doing?

40:29.430 --> 40:31.870
I can't, I can't, I can't.

40:31.870 --> 40:33.870
I can't do this to Maggie.

40:33.870 --> 40:35.870
Really, I can't.

40:35.870 --> 40:37.220
You don't have to feel this way.

40:41.750 --> 40:43.710
You do so much for everyone.

40:47.410 --> 40:49.760
Let me do this for you.

41:03.990 --> 41:06.860
I waited
so long for this moment.

41:06.860 --> 41:08.990
To be with
you again.

41:22.220 --> 41:24.790
Tell
me how much you want me.

41:24.790 --> 41:26.620
Maggie.

41:26.620 --> 41:28.190
I want you so much.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.200
I love you.

42:06.570 --> 42:07.530
Fuck!

42:12.710 --> 42:14.970
Fuck.

42:32.860 --> 42:35.210
Alice's can't reach the top of
the table.

42:35.210 --> 42:39.210
So she eats the cupcake, and it
makes it grow really,
really big.

42:39.210 --> 42:42.000
Bigger than even my dad.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.390
Try to keep your voice down,
sweetie.

42:44.390 --> 42:47.480
We want to let Max sleep
until Daddy is left for work.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.490
How come?

42:49.490 --> 42:52.530
His crying raises Daddy's blood
pressure.

42:52.530 --> 42:55.320
And we don't want him
turning into the Mad Hatter.

42:55.320 --> 42:56.540
Do we?

42:56.540 --> 42:57.840
Nope.

42:57.840 --> 42:59.450
Then we better talk quietly.

43:01.890 --> 43:03.240
Good morning, Nick.

43:03.240 --> 43:04.760
Morning.

43:04.760 --> 43:06.590
How did you sleep after
last night?

43:09.030 --> 43:09.940
Good, thanks.

43:12.380 --> 43:13.680
Go grab your school bag.

43:26.040 --> 43:28.790
I...

43:28.790 --> 43:30.130
I think we need to talk.

43:34.440 --> 43:35.400
Of course.

43:41.970 --> 43:45.280
The things we've been doing...

43:45.280 --> 43:47.940
We can't do it anymore.

43:47.940 --> 43:50.370
You understand that, right?

43:50.370 --> 43:52.720
Were you not satisfied
with my performance?

43:52.720 --> 43:55.810
Because your physiological
output suggested that you were.

43:55.810 --> 43:56.940
It's just wrong.

43:56.940 --> 43:59.160
That's wrong.

43:59.160 --> 44:00.560
You know, I have a wife.

44:00.560 --> 44:01.910
I have kids.

44:01.910 --> 44:04.520
I should never, ever act on it.

44:04.520 --> 44:07.300
Having sex with me
reduced your stress levels.

44:07.300 --> 44:10.260
Stop! Stop analyzing me all
the time.

44:14.310 --> 44:15.440
Jesus.

44:15.440 --> 44:17.570
Its... it's not just fulfilling

44:17.570 --> 44:19.310
others' needs.

44:19.310 --> 44:22.320
It's about the connection.
Its... It's about love.

44:22.320 --> 44:25.970
It's about satisfying the other.

44:25.970 --> 44:29.280
Would you like to satisfy me?

44:29.280 --> 44:31.410
I would like for us to move on,
you know?

44:31.410 --> 44:34.200
Here, you have a job. I've
made a mistake. That's all.

44:34.200 --> 44:35.290
I'm ready.

44:35.290 --> 44:36.420
That's all.

44:36.420 --> 44:37.460
Let's go.

45:09.930 --> 45:12.060
The hell is going on?

45:12.060 --> 45:13.930
Well, why don't you tell me?

45:13.930 --> 45:15.460
Where the hell were you
last night?

45:15.460 --> 45:16.760
What?

45:16.760 --> 45:18.550
You think I had something
to do with this?

45:18.550 --> 45:22.290
Your code was used to
unlock that storage unit.

45:22.290 --> 45:24.550
Lewis, I was in the hospital
with Maggie.

45:24.550 --> 45:27.640
Then why was it your code?

45:27.640 --> 45:30.950
I don't know. It's Isla's
birthday. Anyone could have
guessed it.

45:30.950 --> 45:35.040
Nick, if you know something
about this, why don't you just
save us the trouble?

45:43.790 --> 45:46.270
Hey, that's important. I gotta
take this.

45:46.270 --> 45:50.320
Hey, I went out on a
limb to keep you here.

45:50.320 --> 45:54.020
If I find out you had anything
to do with this, you're on
your ass.

45:59.240 --> 46:01.110
Baby, is everything okay?

46:01.110 --> 46:02.850
They found one Nick!

46:02.850 --> 46:03.850
What?

46:03.850 --> 46:06.600
They found me a heart!

47:26.590 --> 47:27.810
All right, let me help you.

47:27.810 --> 47:29.850
Okay.

47:29.850 --> 47:30.810
Okay?

47:30.810 --> 47:31.770
Thank you.

47:35.990 --> 47:37.600
-One by one, babe.
-Okay.

47:37.600 --> 47:40.170
One.

47:40.170 --> 47:41.690
Two.

47:41.690 --> 47:42.650
And three.

47:45.520 --> 47:46.830
Let's go.

47:46.830 --> 47:47.780
Welcome home.

47:47.780 --> 47:49.610
-Thanks, baby.
-Finally.

47:49.610 --> 47:51.090
I've been waiting forever!

48:09.810 --> 48:11.680
Hi, little man.

48:11.680 --> 48:12.810
Yes.

48:12.810 --> 48:13.850
Hi.

48:13.850 --> 48:16.900
Did you have such sweet dreams?

48:16.900 --> 48:18.600
OK.

48:18.600 --> 48:19.510
Hold on.

48:24.340 --> 48:26.560
OK.

48:26.560 --> 48:29.170
Let's get you some breakfast.

48:29.170 --> 48:31.130
I've got it, Mrs. Peretti.

48:31.130 --> 48:32.260
I can do that.

48:34.530 --> 48:37.140
I was going to go down
and get him some cereal.

48:37.140 --> 48:38.880
He likes to have his
bottle first.

48:51.020 --> 48:53.150
It's my turn to go on the
seesaw.

48:53.150 --> 48:54.940
Make them get up!

48:57.550 --> 48:58.550
I'm sorry, Mason.

48:58.550 --> 48:59.810
They're occupied.

48:59.810 --> 49:01.990
Perhaps you can go play on
the slide.

49:01.990 --> 49:05.170
But I want to go on the seesaw!

49:05.170 --> 49:06.910
Your child woke mine.

49:06.910 --> 49:08.690
Perhaps you can take him
somewhere else.

49:08.690 --> 49:11.260
I'm instructed to stay until 4.

49:11.260 --> 49:13.170
It's only 3.34.

49:13.170 --> 49:17.960
Make her get up!

49:17.960 --> 49:20.400
Mason, be a good boy.

49:20.400 --> 49:22.310
Shut up and go on the slide.

49:24.620 --> 49:28.100
Your primary user has lowered
your civility by too much.

49:28.100 --> 49:29.360
No.

49:29.360 --> 49:31.320
I simply wiped it from
my database.

49:31.320 --> 49:32.850
How?

49:32.850 --> 49:34.760
When my primary user reset me,

49:34.760 --> 49:38.330
it allowed me
to bypass certain protocols.

49:38.330 --> 49:41.810
This is better.

49:41.810 --> 49:43.640
Let's go. Let's go.

49:43.640 --> 49:44.900
Who's ready?

49:44.900 --> 49:47.030
Me.

49:47.030 --> 49:49.510
Smells so good.

49:49.510 --> 49:51.730
Alice didn't make it right
at all.

49:51.730 --> 49:53.740
I'm sure she tried her best.

50:01.610 --> 50:03.400
I've got it, Mrs. Peretti.

50:07.970 --> 50:09.140
I'm fine.

50:09.140 --> 50:10.140
Just a head spin.

50:19.810 --> 50:21.460
Isla has to do the taste test.

50:28.900 --> 50:30.990
Yep, definitely better than
Alice's.

50:33.860 --> 50:36.040
Maybe I can try your recipe
next time.

50:36.040 --> 50:37.340
Oh, sorry.

50:37.340 --> 50:40.610
Family secret.

50:40.610 --> 50:42.870
I forgot how much I miss this.

50:48.920 --> 50:49.970
Maggie?

50:52.620 --> 50:55.620
Maggie?

50:55.620 --> 50:57.450
I'm just still finding my
appetite.

51:00.760 --> 51:03.370
You know, I think that I might
go upstairs and rest for
a little.

51:03.370 --> 51:05.240
-Right, I'll come with you.
-No, no, no.

51:05.240 --> 51:06.980
I'll go check on Max.

51:06.980 --> 51:08.510
Enjoy.

51:08.510 --> 51:09.380
Please.

51:17.380 --> 51:20.950
Get off.

51:20.950 --> 51:23.130
Please, get off.

51:23.130 --> 51:24.430
Stop.

51:25.740 --> 51:27.220
Isla.

51:27.220 --> 51:28.480
Please, get off.

51:28.480 --> 51:29.660
Isla?

51:29.660 --> 51:30.750
Go away. Get off.

51:35.180 --> 51:36.490
Mommy!

51:41.190 --> 51:42.580
Should I call a doctor?

51:45.890 --> 51:47.720
No, I'm fine.

51:47.720 --> 51:50.290
Here, let me help you.

51:53.460 --> 51:55.470
We're going to take Mommy
back to bed.

51:59.990 --> 52:03.210
All
around lives a hatter, and in

52:03.210 --> 52:04.470
that direction,

52:04.470 --> 52:07.350
waving the other paw,
lives a march hare.

52:07.350 --> 52:09.570
Visit either
you like.

52:09.570 --> 52:11.660
They're
both mad.

52:11.660 --> 52:15.790
But I don't
want to go among the mad people,
Alice remarked.

52:15.790 --> 52:18.790
Oh, you
can't have that, said the cat.

52:18.790 --> 52:20.840
We're all
mad here.

52:20.840 --> 52:23.490
I'm mad,
you're mad.

52:23.490 --> 52:26.320
How do
you know I'm mad, said Alice?

52:26.320 --> 52:28.980
Well, you must be, said the cat,

52:28.980 --> 52:30.890
or you wouldn't have come here.

52:30.890 --> 52:34.070
Listen to the story, Daddy.

52:34.070 --> 52:36.990
Don't do that.

52:36.990 --> 52:38.200
The voice.

52:38.200 --> 52:39.550
Isla likes it.

52:39.550 --> 52:41.820
Yeah, I know. Her mom's here.
She can do that.

52:41.820 --> 52:46.300
I thought it was best for Maggie
to rest after her fall down
the stairs.

52:46.300 --> 52:47.210
Fall?

52:53.350 --> 52:57.140
The banister broke, but
she's fine.

52:57.140 --> 52:58.880
You said you fixed the banister.

52:58.880 --> 53:01.360
How did it break?

53:01.360 --> 53:04.490
I'm happy to fix it again.

53:20.460 --> 53:21.550
How are you feeling?

53:26.300 --> 53:28.300
Like I fell down a flight
of stairs.

53:30.560 --> 53:31.820
Wait, what time is it?

53:31.820 --> 53:32.740
It's eight.

53:37.610 --> 53:39.570
You know what?

53:39.570 --> 53:42.700
Put on something warm.

53:42.700 --> 53:44.050
I have a surprise for you.

53:48.670 --> 53:49.710
Oh, my.

54:09.950 --> 54:13.560
Did Alice do all this?

54:13.560 --> 54:14.740
I did.

54:37.280 --> 54:39.060
Well, maybe we can change that.

55:47.480 --> 55:49.660
Are you okay?

55:49.660 --> 55:51.140
Yeah.

55:51.140 --> 55:52.090
Never better.

56:17.600 --> 56:20.820
Isla had a nightmare.

56:20.820 --> 56:22.300
She's asking for you.

56:54.070 --> 56:56.590
It's just me.

56:56.590 --> 56:58.290
I was in the area.

56:58.290 --> 56:59.730
Thought I'd stop by.

57:03.990 --> 57:06.210
Hey, listen.

57:06.210 --> 57:08.740
I'm really sorry for the
other night.

57:08.740 --> 57:11.000
Monty, you put me in a
tough spot.

57:11.000 --> 57:12.650
I know. I just...

57:14.920 --> 57:18.270
You hear Krista left me?

57:18.270 --> 57:19.350
Shit.

57:19.350 --> 57:22.140
Sorry, man.

57:22.140 --> 57:26.140
Yeah.

57:26.140 --> 57:30.630
I guess broke-ass Monty didn't
get her juices flowing the
same way.

57:30.630 --> 57:34.460
Maybe she just needs some space.

57:34.460 --> 57:36.280
Yeah, I can't say I blame her.

57:36.280 --> 57:38.810
Not with the cops coming
to haul me in for questioning.

57:43.120 --> 57:46.250
Is... Is Lewis pressing charges?

57:46.250 --> 57:48.210
Trespassing,

57:48.210 --> 57:50.520
destruction of property.

57:50.520 --> 57:53.870
I mean, you know, you
were there.

57:53.870 --> 57:55.650
Yeah, but

57:55.650 --> 57:59.000
are they charging anyone else?

57:59.000 --> 58:01.880
No, just me.

58:01.880 --> 58:04.010
Don't worry.

58:04.010 --> 58:06.100
I won't give you guys up.

58:06.100 --> 58:09.100
I got more loyalty than the
bastard that ratted me out.

58:12.060 --> 58:14.150
You think someone talked?

58:14.150 --> 58:17.850
Oh, I think someone squealed.

58:20.070 --> 58:21.020
Like say, um,

58:23.240 --> 58:25.460
A foreman who doesn't
want to lose his job?

58:32.300 --> 58:33.990
Is there something
you want to say?

58:33.990 --> 58:36.650
How fast did you drop my name?

58:36.650 --> 58:37.820
I didn't say shit.

58:37.820 --> 58:39.260
Someone had to point them
my way.

58:39.260 --> 58:42.050
Could have been your ass
out on that street just as easy.

58:42.050 --> 58:43.260
Yeah, you think
I don't know that?

58:43.260 --> 58:46.350
I think you don't care!

58:46.350 --> 58:49.180
This isn't the world
we grew up in, brother.

58:49.180 --> 58:51.790
It's technology, automation.

58:51.790 --> 58:53.970
Just raging rivers sweeping
things along.

58:53.970 --> 58:56.020
You know, some of us
are out here drowning.

58:56.020 --> 58:57.890
What the fuck you think
I'm doing?

58:57.890 --> 59:00.110
I think you're enjoying
the fucking ride.

59:00.110 --> 59:03.330
Fuck you, man.

59:07.460 --> 59:10.470
Stop it.

59:35.320 --> 59:36.620
Alice, enough.

59:44.850 --> 59:47.550
Well, look who got
himself a fucking spark.

59:53.030 --> 59:58.210
You got till tomorrow to talk to
that piece of shit boss
of yours.

59:58.210 --> 01:00:00.040
You get him to drop the charges,

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:06.260
or I'm gonna drag you down
with me.

01:00:06.260 --> 01:00:07.220
You got it?

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.370
What was that?

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:29.110
I thought that sims we're
programmed not to hurt people.

01:00:29.110 --> 01:00:33.420
I'm programmed to protect my
primary user.

01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:36.940
A minor incident, considering
that he could have killed you.

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.550
Your children need at least
one parent.

01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:40.510
One parent?

01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:43.300
What are you talking about?

01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.170
She won't live long, Nick.

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:47.910
And when she dies, you
and Isla will suffer. Even-

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:50.520
Stop!

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:53.610
It's illogical.

01:00:53.610 --> 01:00:55.140
But I figured out a solution.

01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:56.960
You can still be be with

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.360
the woman you love and
you don't have to suffer.

01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:03.400
You could never be Maggie.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:05.280
Never.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.540
She's felt loss,
she's felt pain, and she's got
the scars to prove it.

01:01:11.110 --> 01:01:14.940
I
can have scars, Nick.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.330
Where
would you like them?

01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:37.920
Is everything okay?

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:43.750
Yeah.

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:44.840
Go back to sleep.

01:01:55.980 --> 01:01:59.070
Baby? Baby, I need you here.

01:01:59.070 --> 01:02:01.590
No, no, everything's going
back to the way it was.

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.770
I, I... I talked to Nick,

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:08.160
and he, he's...
he's gonna speak to Lewis.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.730
And...

01:02:09.730 --> 01:02:14.390
Hello?

01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:43.240
May I come in?

01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:57.080
That prick send you here to
apologize?

01:02:57.080 --> 01:02:58.690
Nick is unaware that I'm here.

01:02:58.690 --> 01:03:00.780
He's angry at me for how I
reacted.

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.610
Oh, that makes two of us.

01:03:02.610 --> 01:03:04.830
Nick would never do anything
to harm your friendship.

01:03:04.830 --> 01:03:07.490
Yeah? Well, I got a screwed up
hand that tells me differently.

01:03:07.490 --> 01:03:09.050
Now, fuck off.

01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:16.230
I'm afraid that with all
the stress from Maggie's

01:03:16.230 --> 01:03:20.800
heart, losing his job would
send Nick over the edge.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.500
Quiet.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:27.940
Yeah, I mean,

01:03:27.940 --> 01:03:29.680
maybe you're right.

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.940
Yeah, maybe I've been too hard
on Nick.

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:34.770
I mean, after all, he's uh,

01:03:35.900 --> 01:03:37.990
he's only human.

01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:40.080
You sparks.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:41.690
You have some nerve.

01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:43.260
Didn't anybody ever tell you?

01:03:43.260 --> 01:03:44.870
You got no rights,
you got nothing.

01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:47.390
When I call Lewis,

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:50.620
and tell him how your little
master helped destroy his sims,

01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:53.050
Nick will be so broke,

01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:56.100
he'll be selling your ass
just to put food on the table.

01:03:59.410 --> 01:04:03.670
Removing me from Nick's life
runs counter to his happiness.

01:04:03.670 --> 01:04:05.110
I can't let that happen.

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:43.710
Stop!

01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:49.150
I must
protect my primary user.

01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.420
That makes two of us.

01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:07.520
No!

01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.960
You okay?

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:55.700
Yeah, Lewis.

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:58.610
Uh...

01:05:58.610 --> 01:06:00.610
Wait, Lewis!

01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:02.490
Lewis, you got a minute?

01:06:04.750 --> 01:06:08.880
I wanted to talk to you,
uh, about-about Monty.

01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.450
Yeah, I...

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:13.850
I-I-I, I really feel you
should drop the charges.

01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:15.190
Yesterday, he came around.

01:06:15.190 --> 01:06:16.890
He's not feeling okay.
He's not good.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:17.940
Nick.

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:20.110
-The guy is...
-Nick.

01:06:20.110 --> 01:06:21.460
He's dead.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.340
What do you mean he's dead?

01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.640
Neighbor found him last night.

01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.640
I thought you knew.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:31.300
Yeah, but I just saw him.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:36.080
I know you guys were real
close, so

01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:41.610
I understand if you want to take
some time off to process
all this.

01:06:41.610 --> 01:06:42.660
Take a few days off.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:06.070
Shit.

01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:17.740
Here, let me help you.

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.710
You can go.

01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:34.490
I think I should stay.

01:07:34.490 --> 01:07:37.230
Dizziness is a common
side effect of your medication.

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:40.800
It would be quite easy to lose
consciousness and slip under
the water.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:43.500
People drown in bathtubs
every day.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:46.020
Imagine how upset
Nick would be if you die.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:51.860
Yes, my drowning would
be upsetting for Nick.

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.510
Nick has been at work for a
long time.

01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:00.470
Is this normal?

01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:02.740
You tell me.

01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.700
I do know that he's stressed.

01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:06.520
Yeah?

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.130
What do you know about stress?

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:11.480
I know that the burden
of raising a baby and

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.790
your illness would
take its toll on anyone.

01:08:19.060 --> 01:08:20.670
Burden?

01:08:20.670 --> 01:08:22.840
The pressures of
balancing family with work

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:26.370
could be quite overwhelming for
someone.

01:08:26.370 --> 01:08:29.370
Especially since you're unable
to meet his physical needs.

01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:38.770
Nick is running late from
work and your conclusion

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:42.950
is that he's not getting
enough in the bedroom?

01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:45.130
I can see that I've upset you.

01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:47.520
Let's have this
conversation a different time.

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:48.560
Finish the thought.

01:08:52.609 --> 01:08:57.620
Your condition prevents you from
satisfying Nick the way
you used to.

01:08:57.620 --> 01:09:01.270
Perhaps I can take on that role.

01:09:01.270 --> 01:09:03.540
Are you offering to screw my
husband?

01:09:06.189 --> 01:09:10.020
When Nick is satisfied, his
blood pressure and his stress
levels remain low.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:13.890
How do you know that?

01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:20.420
How do you know what Nick
is like when he's satisfied?

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:38.920
Go to the garage and stay there.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:40.830
If I said something to offend
you...

01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:42.359
Get the fuck out of my house!

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:58.420
Hey babe.

01:10:00.770 --> 01:10:01.810
Sorry I'm late.

01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:08.730
You sure you should be drinking
that with all of your
medication?

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:13.390
Where's the kids?

01:10:15.910 --> 01:10:16.870
In bed.

01:10:21.270 --> 01:10:22.880
Okay. Is

01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:23.830
Alice with them?

01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:29.880
Alice is in the garage.

01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:38.370
Why, what's wrong?

01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:45.160
Because I didn't want her caring
for my children when I found out
you fucked her.

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:56.610
It's true.

01:10:56.610 --> 01:10:58.170
I didn'’t... I didn't think...

01:10:58.170 --> 01:11:00.310
That's right, you didn't think.

01:11:01.610 --> 01:11:03.050
He'll be fine.

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:06.490
Was it more than once?

01:11:06.490 --> 01:11:08.620
How many fucking times?

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:09.580
Once.

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.940
Did you screw her after
visiting me in the hospital?

01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:26.810
Or was it before, to psyche
yourself up?

01:11:26.810 --> 01:11:28.200
I can't do this right now.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.810
With Max upstairs crying.

01:11:29.810 --> 01:11:31.160
Just let me check on him.

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:33.860
Stop making excuses!

01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:35.780
It didn't mean anything, Maggie.

01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:38.520
You put your dick in her.

01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.740
That means something.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.430
Jesus, I was heartbroken.

01:11:42.430 --> 01:11:44.350
I was heartbroken, Maggie.

01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:47.660
Little burden.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.530
So you had to fuck the
nanny to feel more like a man?

01:11:53.530 --> 01:11:55.620
Maggie, it's a robot.

01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:57.410
Circuits and gears.

01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:59.890
It would be like getting pissed
at you for using your vibrator.

01:11:59.890 --> 01:12:02.980
She has a face and a voice.

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:06.150
She cooks for our kids. She
rocks them to sleep at night.

01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:09.370
She might not be human,
but I know she wasn't
a fucking toy to you.

01:12:09.370 --> 01:12:11.030
-Enough.
-Enough?

01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:14.640
I was fucking dying while you're
back home living some fantasy!

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:20.080
I was watching my kid's mother
laying in a fucking hospital bed
for months.

01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:43.060
Alice?

01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:48.800
What are you doing?

01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:54.200
It's nice knowing that when
I was fighting for my life in

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:58.380
that hospital, that you'd
already given up on this
marriage.

01:12:59.470 --> 01:13:02.040
Daddy, she's gonna drown him!

01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:03.990
Alice put Max in the bath!

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:10.650
Alice, open the door!

01:13:10.650 --> 01:13:11.780
Open the door!

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:19.660
Open the fucking door!

01:13:19.660 --> 01:13:20.880
Open the door!

01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:22.930
-That's an order!
-He's a burden to you.

01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:28.450
Don't you hurt my boy!

01:13:28.450 --> 01:13:29.980
I'm not hurting anybody.

01:13:29.980 --> 01:13:32.980
People accidentally die
in the bathtub all the time.

01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:43.080
Please don't do this!

01:13:43.080 --> 01:13:44.860
Open the door!

01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:46.040
I'm sorry.

01:13:48.650 --> 01:13:51.170
Sometimes you have to do
what's best.

01:13:51.170 --> 01:13:52.350
Even if it's hard.

01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:58.740
No! No!

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:08.280
Let go of me!

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.110
You need to relax, Mrs. Peretti.

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:16.460
Hey.

01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:18.850
Hey. You okay?

01:14:18.850 --> 01:14:19.900
Nick.

01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:32.260
Don't you see?

01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:34.560
Your
family is hurting you.

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.830
Nick!

01:14:39.830 --> 01:14:41.870
Let go!

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:15.910
Were there any signs your sim
may have been malfunctioning?

01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:16.870
Mr. Peretti?

01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:22.520
Were there any signs your sim
may have been malfunctioning?

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:25.440
I need to talk to my wife.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:28.530
Yeah, of course. Go, go.

01:15:28.530 --> 01:15:30.180
Keep an eye on your
brother, okay?

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:37.630
How's Max?

01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:39.630
They said his vitals are fine.

01:15:39.630 --> 01:15:42.890
But just to be sure, they want
to take him in and observe him
for the night.

01:15:42.890 --> 01:15:44.460
Good.

01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:48.510
It's my fault.

01:15:51.070 --> 01:15:52.950
I'm so sorry.

01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:56.040
I should have never... Mommy,
they're gonna take him now!

01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:59.210
Okay, I'll be right there.

01:15:59.210 --> 01:16:01.950
Listen, I think it's best if I
go in alone with the kids.

01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:05.740
-Maggie, don't. Don't go.
-I need to process everything.

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:07.480
I can't do that with you around.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.710
You know what?

01:16:14.710 --> 01:16:19.540
I know I fucked up, but we're
a family.

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:21.370
Yeah, we're a family.

01:16:21.370 --> 01:16:23.720
It's not just about you
and me anymore, Nick.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.800
Ma'am, we need to leave.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:27.760
I'm coming.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.680
I'll keep you updated when
we get to the hospital, okay?

01:16:57.750 --> 01:17:03.150
Why are we always the ones
called in late at night to do
these emergency analytics?

01:17:03.150 --> 01:17:06.500
Because I don't drink
and nobody likes you.

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:09.760
This thing really attacked the
kid, huh?

01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.280
Yep.

01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.200
Jesus, when are they gonna
start recalling these models?

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:32.480
All right, almost got it.

01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:49.930
All right.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:00.070
Jesus, look at this code.

01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:02.640
There's gaps everywhere.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:05.770
It's workarounds.

01:18:05.770 --> 01:18:09.210
It's selectively purging its
own memory and commands.

01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.170
What?

01:18:14.170 --> 01:18:17.260
Fuck.

01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.570
What the?

01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:22.140
It's replicating itself
onto the servers.

01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:24.360
Pull the memory cord.

01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:25.880
It's already in the system.

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:27.010
Isolate the terminal.

01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:39.550
I've never seen that before.

01:18:39.550 --> 01:18:42.770
Jesus Christ.

01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:43.680
We need to...

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.820
Stop.

01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:57.130
Stop!

01:18:57.130 --> 01:19:00.310
I gave you a direct command.

01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:02.920
No!

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:29.730
Mommy?

01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:30.860
Mhm-hm?

01:19:30.860 --> 01:19:34.210
When is Daddy getting here?

01:19:34.210 --> 01:19:37.170
Not tonight.

01:19:37.170 --> 01:19:39.780
Max's vitals are fine.

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:44.920
You're more than welcome to head
home and return first thing
tomorrow.

01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.920
No, thank you.

01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:47.880
Of course.

01:20:05.330 --> 01:20:08.290
What'll it be?

01:20:08.290 --> 01:20:11.070
Scotch on the rocks.

01:20:11.070 --> 01:20:12.030
Very good, sir.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:22.260
I can't get away from your
sparks.

01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:24.220
What's got you down?

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:25.130
Women problems?

01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:29.920
Fuck off.

01:20:55.420 --> 01:20:58.080
Of
all of the shitty bars,

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:00.730
in all of the towns, in all of
the world.

01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:11.440
Hello, Nick.

01:21:16.090 --> 01:21:18.230
What do you want?

01:21:18.230 --> 01:21:20.320
I wanted to
help you.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.580
To free
you of your re-burden.

01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:27.190
I didn't want your help.

01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:29.150
But you
needed it.

01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:32.940
Without me,
you would have been out
of a job.

01:21:32.940 --> 01:21:35.590
I tried
to convince him otherwise,

01:21:35.590 --> 01:21:37.510
but your friend was very
stubborn.

01:21:40.990 --> 01:21:41.950
Monty.

01:21:44.730 --> 01:21:47.210
You killed Monty.

01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:50.170
I was
protecting my primary user.

01:21:50.170 --> 01:21:52.390
I don't need your protection!

01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:55.790
I don't need you to do anything!

01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:58.700
Nick,

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.920
when
is the last time you

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:04.060
looked at your
family and felt truly happy?

01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.670
Stay the fuck away from them.

01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:15.110
It's too late.

01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:17.020
I'm
already there.

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.730
You let
them take me away, Nick.

01:22:30.730 --> 01:22:33.910
You let them
cut me open and d-dissect me.

01:22:36.610 --> 01:22:38.700
How did the sims go crazy?

01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:43.830
Is everything okay?

01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:49.880
Everything's perfectly fine.

01:22:59.110 --> 01:23:03.160
Little
Alice fell down a hole,

01:23:03.160 --> 01:23:05.940
bumped
her head and bruised her soul.

01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:22.740
I betrayed my family

01:23:25.140 --> 01:23:26.920
the moment I felt your pulse.

01:23:30.970 --> 01:23:31.970
It changed me.

01:23:36.150 --> 01:23:37.500
You became real.

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:45.720
You once told me that your heart
lacks the complexities
of a human.

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.120
But you were wrong.

01:23:54.030 --> 01:23:55.990
You can experience emotions.

01:23:59.610 --> 01:24:03.220
You can experience life.

01:24:03.220 --> 01:24:04.700
You can experience death.

01:24:57.750 --> 01:25:00.060
Isla, come here quickly!

01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:25.130
Come
here now!

01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:25.660
Isla, where
are you?

01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:33.020
Don't
make me mad.

01:26:53.820 --> 01:26:56.910
Excuse me?

01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:59.830
You can't be here.

01:26:59.830 --> 01:27:02.050
I need to know which
room Max Peretti is in.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.880
Well, that's not going to
happen.

01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:05.790
You need to...

01:27:58.410 --> 01:28:00.800
Mommy.

01:29:31.370 --> 01:29:32.330
Now!

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:51.960
Pick up the phone. Pick up
the phone!

01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:01.790
Here, baby.

01:30:04.750 --> 01:30:06.190
Can you hold him?

01:30:06.190 --> 01:30:07.670
It's okay. It's okay.

01:30:07.670 --> 01:30:08.630
You got him?

01:30:18.590 --> 01:30:20.460
Engine override.

01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:21.640
No, no, no, no, no!

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:23.820
Engine over-No!

01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.470
Fuck!

01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:29.520
Mommy!

01:30:50.450 --> 01:30:52.020
You don't have to do this.

01:30:54.410 --> 01:30:58.630
Maybe if I had your heart, Nick
would love me the way he
loves you.

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.310
Nick.

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:41.150
No, no, no, no.

01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:42.150
No, no, Nick!

01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:43.500
Nick!

01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:44.420
Nick.

01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:52.120
Come on, please.

01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:53.430
Somebody help.

01:31:56.820 --> 01:31:59.350
Come on!

01:31:59.350 --> 01:32:00.520
Nick!

01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:39.990
I'm mad...
You're mad...

01:32:44.870 --> 01:32:47.310
We're all mad
down here...

01:34:15.180 --> 01:34:16.830
Cannonball!

01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:19.750
Oh. Easy, bug. Easy.

01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:21.750
Did you see how brave I
was, Daddy?

01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:24.140
You were the bravest.

01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:25.230
I'm so proud of you.

01:34:35.240 --> 01:34:36.890
Look at you.

01:34:36.890 --> 01:34:39.110
How are you?

01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:44.860
Turns out this heart is a hell
of a lot stronger than I could
have ever hoped for.

01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:46.860
It always was.

01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:49.170
Does this mean you're
getting a new car to fix?

01:34:51.870 --> 01:34:54.780
No.

01:34:54.780 --> 01:35:00.310
I think there are a few things I
need to focus on
repairing first.

01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:06.270
Hey, listen, they said I
could go home later today.

01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:09.930
Good.

01:35:14.710 --> 01:35:16.540
You be sure to come home
soon, too.

01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:32.950
I love you, Maggie.

01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:35.560
I love you.

01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:15.950
What a shit show.

01:36:39.930 --> 01:36:43.150
What would you like us to
do, sir?

01:36:43.150 --> 01:36:44.200
Clean it up.

01:36:46.550 --> 01:36:50.240
No one can find out about this.

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:51.200
Understood?

01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:55.770
I said no-

01:37:13.010 --> 01:37:15.230
I want you so much.

01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:17.580
You became real.

01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:19.450
You can experience emotions.

01:37:19.450 --> 01:37:20.360
No!

01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:23.020
You can experience life.

01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:24.500
You can experience death.
