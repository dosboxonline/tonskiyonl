WEBVTT

00:25.699 --> 00:27.659
...day after day you want.

00:27.785 --> 00:29.744
A store that one might...

00:31.914 --> 00:35.375
l hate television. lt gives me headaches.

00:35.459 --> 00:38.628
You know, there's so many magnetic waves
traveling in the airspace

00:38.712 --> 00:40.505
because of TV and television,

00:40.589 --> 00:43.174
we're losing ten times as many
brain cells as we're supposed to.

00:43.259 --> 00:45.093
Please!

00:46.095 --> 00:49.973
"The cow says blank." Three letters.

00:51.058 --> 00:52.058
Dude!

00:52.726 --> 00:55.103
"Dude." l don't know.

00:55.187 --> 00:57.355
Magnetic waves, brain cells.

00:57.439 --> 00:59.440
l don't understand the connection
between all that stuff.

00:59.817 --> 01:01.568
You know what else l heard?

01:01.652 --> 01:03.987
Magnetic waves shrink silicone molecules.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.951
Oh, my God! Turn it off!

01:10.035 --> 01:11.828
-lt's not working!
-lt's backwards!

01:11.954 --> 01:13.079
-What do we do?
-l don't know!

01:13.163 --> 01:14.455
Oh, God!

01:18.294 --> 01:21.337
Thank God. l can't afford to get any smaller.

01:21.422 --> 01:24.215
Come on. You're beautiful.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.384
l wish l had your legs.

01:26.468 --> 01:27.802
l wish l had your butt.

01:28.262 --> 01:30.430
-l wish l had your...
-Shaved pussy?

01:31.807 --> 01:33.308
Nobody's getting Snowball.

01:34.852 --> 01:38.563
Okay. That thing's kind of scary, anyway.

01:38.647 --> 01:40.982
-l know something even scarier.
-What?

01:41.275 --> 01:42.609
Have you heard about this videotape?

01:42.693 --> 01:43.902
The one where they do it on the boat?

01:44.069 --> 01:45.904
And then in the car?
And then in the bathtub?

01:45.988 --> 01:49.157
And he's, like, "Hey, baby, l love you."
And she's, like, "Where are we?"

01:49.450 --> 01:51.618
-And did you see the...
-No. Not that tape.

01:52.578 --> 01:54.245
The one with all the scary images.

01:54.330 --> 01:56.789
You know, after you watch the tape,
the phone rings,

01:56.874 --> 02:00.168
and this really scary voice comes on
and says you're gonna die in, like...

02:00.252 --> 02:02.629
Seven days.
Yeah, l saw that one with Josh last weekend.

02:02.838 --> 02:06.466
You were with Josh last weekend?
Oh, my God!

02:06.842 --> 02:08.008
My God!

02:09.011 --> 02:10.261
Oh, yes, l was.

02:11.972 --> 02:13.056
You ho!

02:16.393 --> 02:17.810
You know it!

02:31.367 --> 02:34.619
-This is really weird.
-Yeah.

02:34.703 --> 02:37.163
Big house, only one phone.

02:41.001 --> 02:50.927
Hello?

02:51.178 --> 02:55.264
I'm coming for you, my precious.

02:55.349 --> 02:59.102
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, precious. Having fun?

02:59.186 --> 03:02.981
Ask her which bathroom
has a detachable showerhead.

03:03.065 --> 03:06.776
Anyway, we're just about to go to bed.

03:06.860 --> 03:09.988
No. Not like that.

03:10.072 --> 03:13.574
Well, l guess a woman
would know how to touch a...

03:16.286 --> 03:19.914
Hello?

04:09.965 --> 04:21.100
Katie?

04:29.985 --> 04:36.574
Are you okay?

05:11.610 --> 05:12.693
God!

05:44.768 --> 05:46.561
Tom, did you hear...

05:47.354 --> 05:48.771
The dogs are acting strange.

06:11.044 --> 06:12.086
Sue!

06:13.255 --> 06:16.632
What are you doing out here?
We were worried sick.

06:16.717 --> 06:17.842
What's wrong?

06:28.395 --> 06:30.104
l wonder what they're trying to tell us.

06:38.989 --> 06:42.867
And now, Washington, D.C.'s
Ieading morning news program,

06:42.951 --> 06:44.160
the Morning News.

06:44.494 --> 06:46.037
Good morning. I'm Ross Giggins.

06:46.121 --> 06:48.873
For our top story,
we turn now to Cindy Campbell.

06:48.957 --> 06:49.957
Thank you, Ross.

06:50.417 --> 06:53.044
There's a deveIoping story
in MiddIeburg at this hour.

06:53.128 --> 06:57.882
A mysterious crop circIe appeared
in IocaI farmer, Tom Logan's cornfieId.

06:57.966 --> 07:01.552
EIaborate prank
or extraterrestriaI phenomenon?

07:01.637 --> 07:04.764
We'II update you
as soon as we have any further information,

07:04.848 --> 07:10.019
but, either way, it's cIear something strange
is happening in that smaII town. Ross?

07:11.230 --> 07:13.064
I'm sorry, I wasn't Iistening.

07:13.148 --> 07:15.316
Coming up, more news after this.

07:17.486 --> 07:19.070
-Cindy, you got a second?
-Sure.

07:19.154 --> 07:22.240
l want you to take a look at this
for that big strip-club exposÃ©.

07:22.324 --> 07:24.242
But l'd rather stick with the crop circle story.

07:24.326 --> 07:26.661
Come on.
You know those things are just a hoax.

07:26.745 --> 07:29.664
No, l'm telling you,
l sense something about that cornfield.

07:29.748 --> 07:34.794
Call it women's intuition or ESPN or both,
but l can tell when danger's near. l just...

07:37.714 --> 07:40.424
-My eyes!
-Cindy, it's sweeps month.

07:40.509 --> 07:41.926
Ratings mean everything.

07:42.010 --> 07:46.264
People want human-interest stories,
like the one you did yesterday.

07:46.348 --> 07:48.099
The report on breast augmentation?

07:48.517 --> 07:50.518
lt was just ten minutes of topless women.

07:51.061 --> 07:52.520
l mean, come on.

07:53.438 --> 07:56.107
-Wow!
-Why are these so interesting?

07:56.191 --> 07:57.483
For God's sake!

07:58.485 --> 07:59.694
People don't care about this.

07:59.903 --> 08:03.489
They want hard-hitting stories
and in-depth coverage and... And...

08:03.699 --> 08:04.782
And twins!

08:25.220 --> 08:28.639
You think it was the Kreisel boys
who cut that stuff into your corn?

08:28.724 --> 08:31.142
All l know is my crops are gone.

08:31.226 --> 08:34.520
The bank's gonna foreclose
if l can't pay the rent.

08:34.604 --> 08:38.149
l got 60 days to come up with $1 .50.

08:39.234 --> 08:42.611
l'm sorry.
The last thing you needed was more...

08:43.572 --> 08:45.114
...hardship in your life.

08:46.116 --> 08:47.616
Especially after what happened to your...

08:47.701 --> 08:50.119
Sheriff, l don't need your sympathy.

08:50.203 --> 08:52.621
l didn't mean to upset you, Father.

08:52.706 --> 08:55.708
Please. l'm not a minister anymore.

08:55.792 --> 08:58.419
l lost my faith that terrible night.

08:59.796 --> 09:04.050
Your faith will return,
just as sure as the sun will rise.

09:04.134 --> 09:05.468
Sounds like a long shot.

09:05.552 --> 09:10.056
Look, there's always an explanation
for all this so-called phenomenon.

09:10.140 --> 09:11.223
Maybe you're right.

09:11.433 --> 09:13.434
lt was probably just the Kreisels.

09:13.894 --> 09:15.561
And when l get through with them,

09:15.645 --> 09:19.231
l doubt you'll be seeing anything strange
on this farm for a long time.

09:19.608 --> 09:21.233
You'll see.

09:22.986 --> 09:25.780
You all right, Tom? Get some rest.

09:33.497 --> 09:38.834
George!

09:40.962 --> 09:43.881
l need you back here tomorrow night
after you pick up Sue.

09:43.965 --> 09:45.216
That tractor needs fixing.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.302
Sorry, dawg. l can't help you.
l have to get ready for my show.

09:48.512 --> 09:51.514
Not that stupid hip-hop stuff again.

09:51.598 --> 09:53.933
Damn it, George, when are you gonna
do something with your life?

09:54.017 --> 09:55.393
-l got a dream!
-What is your dream?

09:55.477 --> 09:56.560
To have a dream.

09:57.229 --> 10:00.940
George, all you've done
is chase adolescent fantasies.

10:01.024 --> 10:04.902
"l wanna be an astronaut, a cowboy,
gynecologist to the stars."

10:04.986 --> 10:06.737
And now, this stupid hip-hop thing.

10:06.822 --> 10:10.366
For your information,
this hip-hop thing is gonna get me paid.

10:10.450 --> 10:12.076
l'm gonna win that rap battle
tomorrow night.

10:12.327 --> 10:14.328
Rap battle? For God's sakes.

10:14.496 --> 10:16.414
You just hate me 'cause l'm black.

10:17.541 --> 10:19.208
You don't have any faith in me.

10:19.292 --> 10:21.127
You don't have any faith
in anything anymore.

10:21.211 --> 10:24.964
So why don't you just worry about you,
and l'll worry about...

10:43.024 --> 10:44.150
Cody.

10:45.819 --> 10:47.653
You're late again, Aunt Cindy.

10:47.737 --> 10:49.864
l'm sorry. l was stuck in traffic.

10:49.948 --> 10:53.534
-Cindy!
-Brenda, hi!

10:53.618 --> 10:55.369
lt's great to see you!

10:56.371 --> 10:58.956
-lt's been so long.
-Too long.

10:59.040 --> 11:00.416
l've been working so hard.

11:00.500 --> 11:02.626
You know, l've had to spend
more and more time at the station.

11:02.711 --> 11:05.713
The news just keeps coming in.

11:05.797 --> 11:07.381
What was the assignment?

11:07.883 --> 11:09.216
Draw your family and friends.

11:10.177 --> 11:12.219
So, anyone new in your life, Cindy?

11:12.888 --> 11:15.806
Well, you know,
l just haven't found the right guy.

11:15.891 --> 11:18.559
l'm looking for something more
than just good sex.

11:18.643 --> 11:20.227
l know, you want commitment.

11:20.312 --> 11:22.730
No, l want great sex.
And when l meet that guy...

11:22.814 --> 11:25.232
That's what l'm talking about!

11:25.317 --> 11:28.152
You want a guy
that's gonna hit that thing hard, like...

11:30.197 --> 11:32.698
And then flip you over
and come at you from the other side.

11:32.824 --> 11:34.742
D-O-double-G.

11:35.410 --> 11:37.828
Did l say stop drawing?

11:38.914 --> 11:42.416
And then he'll look at you,
like he gonna cut you.

11:44.085 --> 11:47.171
Brenda, you're so romantic.

11:48.131 --> 11:49.131
l guess.

11:49.549 --> 11:52.259
Look, when l meet Mr. Right, l'll know.

11:53.762 --> 11:55.137
Uncle George!

11:55.430 --> 11:57.473
Hey, sweetie, come here!

11:57.766 --> 11:59.141
How are you?

12:00.060 --> 12:03.521
Go get your stuff, okay?

12:03.605 --> 12:06.190
l know you. You're Tom Logan's brother.

12:06.775 --> 12:09.151
-And you're that reporter, Cindy Campbell.
-Yeah.

12:09.277 --> 12:10.945
You did the story on our cop cycles.

12:11.780 --> 12:12.863
Crop circles.

12:13.114 --> 12:14.281
Right.

12:15.116 --> 12:17.243
So, you're here to pick up your...

12:17.327 --> 12:18.827
Nephew. Cody.

12:19.454 --> 12:20.746
You don't dress like a farmer.

12:21.122 --> 12:22.373
My brother's the farmer.

12:22.791 --> 12:25.209
l'm the rapper.

12:25.293 --> 12:27.836
For real. And here's the 6-1 -1 on that.

12:28.004 --> 12:30.631
That's phone repair. You mean 4-1 -1 .

12:31.633 --> 12:32.883
Right.

12:32.968 --> 12:35.844
So, l'll be doing the rap battle
at the 23 Club tomorrow night.

12:36.638 --> 12:37.805
l don't believe this shit.

12:37.889 --> 12:40.015
Word. You two should come down!

12:40.100 --> 12:43.394
l be rappin', l be cappin',
l be tappin', l be flappin',

12:43.478 --> 12:48.065
l be happening. Ding, bing, wing. Yo!

12:48.483 --> 12:51.026
-Sounds good.
-Would, could, should, 'hood.

12:51.945 --> 12:53.404
Gug, mug, dug, bug.

12:53.822 --> 12:56.448
lf we say we'll come,
will you shut your ass up?

12:57.158 --> 13:00.911
Okay, then. Fresh.
l'll see you guys tomorrow night.

13:01.079 --> 13:03.664
-Okay. Bye.
-Peace out.

13:09.004 --> 13:10.838
Now, who the fuck did that?

13:17.012 --> 13:19.430
Honey, what is it?
Are you having one of your visions?

13:19.514 --> 13:21.890
There's a girl with black hair.

13:22.517 --> 13:24.143
She wants to kill you.

13:25.353 --> 13:29.690
Your period starts in three, two, one.

13:29.774 --> 13:32.318
What else? Cody, what else do you see?

13:32.402 --> 13:35.946
l see a little boy and a grown woman,
but no father.

13:36.531 --> 13:39.199
-Cody.
-l see you kneeling in dog shit.

13:39.409 --> 13:40.492
What?

13:41.536 --> 13:44.038
Oh, for God's sake.

13:44.372 --> 13:45.789
Cody, don't you understand?

13:45.874 --> 13:48.876
As long as we have each other,
that's all we need.

13:49.127 --> 13:51.712
Cody, l know things have been tough
for you since your mom died.

13:51.963 --> 13:56.133
God, l've been so selfish.
Always putting my career first.

13:56.217 --> 13:59.303
From now on,
l'm gonna be thinking about you 24...

13:59.929 --> 14:00.929
Damn!

14:02.390 --> 14:03.766
Wait, Cindy!

14:20.575 --> 14:23.661
Honey, l'm gonna be leaving soon, so...

14:37.133 --> 14:38.467
Do you know who she is?

14:39.344 --> 14:40.928
No,

14:41.012 --> 14:43.263
but sometimes she talks to me.

14:43.348 --> 14:45.057
She's coming tonight.

14:58.655 --> 15:01.115
-Father Muldoon!
-Cindy.

15:01.199 --> 15:05.077
l'm so grateful you could come.
l've called all over for babysitters.

15:05.161 --> 15:07.496
l don't mind filling in now and then.

15:08.623 --> 15:10.374
Where is little Cody?

15:13.420 --> 15:15.713
l don't know.
He must be back in his room, playing.

15:15.964 --> 15:18.799
Anyway, make sure
Cody washes everywhere.

15:18.883 --> 15:21.760
Also, he has a little rash on his behind.

15:21.845 --> 15:25.013
Could you rub this lotion
on his little bottom?

15:25.098 --> 15:27.391
Just apply it liberally.

15:27.475 --> 15:29.643
Thank you, Father. Good night.

15:34.315 --> 15:35.566
Cody.

15:47.412 --> 15:49.788
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's getting thick up in here.

15:50.290 --> 15:52.499
Hey, Iook,
before we get on with the battIes tonight,

15:52.584 --> 15:54.334
I got a coupIe announcements to make.

15:54.419 --> 15:57.838
I know y'aII are gonna wanna bust a cap
in the air for your favorite rapper,

15:57.922 --> 16:02.926
but if you couId pIease hoId on
to your gunfire untiI the end of the show.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.929
Now, Iook, Iet's just put the safeties on.

16:06.181 --> 16:09.016
It's on the Ieft side of the gun
above the trigger guard.

16:11.686 --> 16:14.563
WiII somebody get his ass out of here?
Get his ass up out of here!

16:14.856 --> 16:17.858
AII right. DJ, spin that shit!

16:39.672 --> 16:41.590
-My bad.
-Mother...

16:45.178 --> 16:48.305
Brenda, is something wrong?
You look scared.

16:48.389 --> 16:51.225
l don't know.
All that stuff you was saying on TV,

16:51.559 --> 16:54.311
l just got a weird feeling
something bad is heading my way,

16:54.395 --> 16:57.523
like when you see an Asian person
behind the wheel of a car.

16:58.024 --> 16:59.566
Cindy, after the show,

16:59.984 --> 17:02.736
if l don't end up on all fours
with some anonymous guy,

17:02.821 --> 17:04.112
or drink an ass load of Cristal

17:04.196 --> 17:06.990
and have to sleep it off
in a dumpster behind the Sizzler,

17:07.075 --> 17:09.992
you think maybe you could come back
to my crib and hang out with me?

17:10.078 --> 17:11.328
l don't wanna be alone.

17:11.746 --> 17:13.163
Of course l will, Brenda.

-Dude!

17:26.928 --> 17:30.556

17:31.808 --> 17:33.851

17:33.935 --> 17:34.977

1 00, 200 whitey-hating, chrome-packing,

17:38.940 --> 17:41.608

who ain't bringing that shit.

17:41.776 --> 17:44.069
-Yeah. At least. Yeah.
-Word.

17:44.445 --> 17:46.405
What's wrong, George?

17:46.489 --> 17:48.866
You ever wonder when it's time
to stop living up here

17:48.950 --> 17:51.410
and start living down here?

17:51.494 --> 17:54.371
But what if we stop living over here
and move over there?

17:54.455 --> 17:56.707
Shit, my Aunt ShaNeequa
used to live over there, man,

17:56.791 --> 17:58.292

-Word?

17:58.376 --> 17:59.501
-Yeah, l'm dead serious.

17:59.627 --> 18:01.753
-Mice.
-Mice? l thought she had rats.

18:01.838 --> 18:03.714
No, man. Rats are outside, mice are inside.

18:03.798 --> 18:05.841
Yo, but what if a mouse goes outside?
Does it become a rat?

18:05.967 --> 18:07.634
And if a rat is in the house, is it a mouse?

18:07.886 --> 18:09.887
l ain't never seen no mouse outside.
That's what l'm saying.

18:09.971 --> 18:11.305
That's because it's a rat, fool!

18:11.389 --> 18:14.641
Damn. Yeah, you might've just made a fact
just now. That's some real shit!

18:14.976 --> 18:16.810

Yo, George, you need something?
'Cause l will do anything for you.

18:21.649 --> 18:22.649
Anything.

18:24.152 --> 18:27.696

whitey-hating gangsters, perhaps...

18:27.822 --> 18:29.948

When you a hype man, you take them hits.

18:42.045 --> 18:43.420
Now, let's get out there, man!

18:43.838 --> 18:45.672
Heads or taiI, pIayboy, what's it gonna be?

18:46.215 --> 18:48.008
You cannot escape your fate in the streets

18:48.468 --> 18:50.719
Okay, I count cash, you count sheep

19:11.616 --> 19:14.242
This club is totally pathetic.

22:57.466 --> 22:59.968
I grew up on a farm
And I was born with no rhythm

23:00.261 --> 23:02.846

24:02.531 --> 24:04.616
Thanks for coming over tonight, Cindy.

24:04.700 --> 24:07.077
l guess l'm just going through a rough time.

24:07.495 --> 24:10.622
Brenda, you want to tell me
what's really bothering you?

24:13.417 --> 24:17.462
Well, there's something l need to...
l saw a tape.

24:18.339 --> 24:20.340
l think you should know about it.

24:20.424 --> 24:23.301
lt had these really shocking images, Cindy.

24:23.386 --> 24:25.762
Brenda, it was Mardi Gras.

24:26.180 --> 24:28.974
l never drank vodka before,
and l was out of beads!

24:29.267 --> 24:31.017
No, not that tape, Cindy.

24:31.686 --> 24:33.353
Well, l guess it's just an urban legend.

24:33.854 --> 24:35.855
You watch it,

24:35.940 --> 24:39.693
and as soon as it's over,
your phone rings and a creepy voice says,

24:39.819 --> 24:41.695
"You're gonna die in seven days."

24:42.822 --> 24:44.197
And seven days later...

24:45.908 --> 24:46.908
When did you watch it?

24:47.368 --> 24:49.202
A week ago.

24:49.287 --> 24:52.372
-A week ago tonight.

26:20.336 --> 26:21.378

29:44.164 --> 29:46.291
l'm sorry about that night.

29:47.209 --> 29:51.296
lf l hadn't fallen asleep while driving
for that exact 20 minutes,

29:51.672 --> 29:54.924
if l hadn't drank that
exact whole bottle of JÃ¤germeister,

29:55.259 --> 29:59.929
if l hadn't raped and mutilated
that exact mulatto hitchhiker...

30:00.014 --> 30:01.681
-Sayaman...
-...if l hadn't been caught in that

30:01.765 --> 30:04.434
exact motel room
with those exact two boys...

30:04.518 --> 30:08.521
Sayaman. l don't see
what any of this has to do with Annie.

30:08.897 --> 30:11.566
l'm sorry. Those were other nights.

30:11.650 --> 30:14.152
But if it had been that night,

30:14.236 --> 30:17.947
l might have missed her. That terrible night.

30:24.079 --> 30:25.371
Hey!

30:38.761 --> 30:42.221
-lt's your wife, Father. She's hurt.
-Annie?

30:42.556 --> 30:44.891
She was hit by a truck
and she's pinned against a tree.

30:45.559 --> 30:46.559
l don't understand.

30:47.019 --> 30:50.521
As long as the truck has her pinned,
she'll stay alive.

30:51.065 --> 30:52.482
l still don't get it.

30:56.904 --> 31:00.073
This is your wife.

31:01.909 --> 31:02.950
She broke her wiener?

31:06.163 --> 31:08.373
Look what happens to the taco.

31:10.334 --> 31:14.420
Look, l don't understand all this
fancy medical lingo. l wanna see Annie.

31:16.548 --> 31:18.633
She's split in half.

31:18.717 --> 31:22.595
You mean, like down-the-middle in half?

31:23.430 --> 31:24.430
At the waist.

31:24.890 --> 31:28.017
You mean this is the last time
l can talk to the top half?

31:29.269 --> 31:33.523
Yes. The truck is the only thing
that is holding her together.

31:34.274 --> 31:37.235
Let's say this is her bottom half.

31:37.945 --> 31:39.612
Can l squeeze in a few minutes with that?

31:40.948 --> 31:43.116
l'm not sure what you mean.

31:44.118 --> 31:46.536
-Let me explain.
-Tom.

31:46.620 --> 31:48.621
Go to her.

31:56.296 --> 31:59.382
Tom, l'll need a ride home.

32:02.511 --> 32:05.304
Hey, baby. How's it going?

32:06.765 --> 32:08.141
l'm dying, Tom.

32:08.600 --> 32:12.145
Don't talk like that. The truck barely hit you.

32:14.481 --> 32:17.650
Honey, kiss me one last time.

32:20.779 --> 32:23.114
Promise me you'll never remarry.

32:23.907 --> 32:25.032
l promise.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.618
And no sex, either.

32:29.204 --> 32:31.205
l'm sorry. l didn't catch that.

32:31.832 --> 32:34.959
-No sex.
-Honey, you're not speaking clearly.

32:35.043 --> 32:37.170
-Your injuries must be awful.
-No sex.

32:37.254 --> 32:38.963
-Cruel fate to shroud my wife's...
-No sex.

32:39.047 --> 32:40.548
-...dying words in mystery.
-No sex.

32:40.632 --> 32:42.592
-No sex!
-Poor Annie.

32:42.676 --> 32:45.720
We hardly knew her.
She'll be missed terribly.

32:45.804 --> 32:48.264
-Jesus.
-That's right, honey, go into the light.

32:48.348 --> 32:49.599
Look!

32:49.683 --> 32:52.143
Just tell George, "Swing away."

32:52.686 --> 32:54.020
Right. Swing away.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.939
Sure. That you understand.

32:58.942 --> 33:01.235
Annie? Annie!

33:03.405 --> 33:05.323
l'm sorry, dude.

33:05.407 --> 33:09.786
Don't call me dude.
l'm not a stoner anymore, not since...

33:11.705 --> 33:13.414
Goodbye, Tom.

33:29.389 --> 33:31.224
l'm so sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Meeks.

33:31.975 --> 33:33.184
Brenda was a good friend

33:33.644 --> 33:34.852
when she was alive.

33:34.937 --> 33:39.023
My sweet, sweet Brenda.
She looks so peaceful.

33:44.112 --> 33:47.323
lf only God had taken us
instead of our daughter.

33:47.741 --> 33:51.244
And knowing your Brenda like l did,
l'd say she wishes the same thing.

33:53.956 --> 33:55.081
These just came today.

33:56.208 --> 33:58.459
Photos from a trip she took.

34:02.256 --> 34:04.423
-They're blank.
-Turn them around, honey.

34:07.261 --> 34:08.386
Yes, of course.

34:09.429 --> 34:11.389
-Who's this?
-That's Ralph.

34:11.764 --> 34:13.391
He's right over there.

34:19.731 --> 34:20.731
Cody?

34:20.815 --> 34:23.693
lt's a boy. He's going to be an asshole.

34:24.444 --> 34:27.780
Smoke all you want.
You're gonna get hit by a bus.

34:28.282 --> 34:30.741
That's not fooling anyone.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.453
-Cindy.
-George.

34:34.538 --> 34:37.873
Hey. Sue wanted to pay her respects
to her teacher.

34:38.958 --> 34:41.210
-You?
-Brenda was my bitch.

34:41.295 --> 34:42.335
Of course.

34:45.632 --> 34:47.049
Are you okay?

34:47.134 --> 34:49.135
lt's just the open coffin.

34:49.553 --> 34:51.344
l can't believe
they just leave it out here like this.

34:51.804 --> 34:53.973
-George, it's a wake.
-Awake?

34:54.056 --> 34:55.600
-Brenda! lt's a miracle!
-No! George, stop!

34:55.809 --> 34:56.976
l thought you were dead!

34:57.269 --> 34:59.061
Sue, your teacher's alive!

34:59.146 --> 35:00.521
-Hello?
-What did he say?

35:00.606 --> 35:03.900
l got your back, George! l got your back!

35:05.152 --> 35:06.152
l'll tell you what!

35:09.990 --> 35:11.741
Mahalik, she's alive! Brenda!

35:11.825 --> 35:15.077
-George, stop! She's dead!
-Brenda! No! We won't lose you again!

35:15.162 --> 35:17.163
Mahalik, help!

35:17.414 --> 35:18.414
Nothing!

35:21.919 --> 35:23.961
-She's not breathing!
-No!

35:24.087 --> 35:26.005
Live, damn it! Live!

35:26.089 --> 35:27.256
Don't!

35:27.633 --> 35:29.300
Live, damn it! Live!

35:30.886 --> 35:32.345
Let me open her windpipe!

35:34.598 --> 35:36.682
-Charles! Charles, stop them!
-Breathe!

35:40.395 --> 35:42.688
Someone stop them! What are they doing?

35:42.856 --> 35:44.231
Get off!

35:44.524 --> 35:46.525
She's alive! She's alive!

35:46.985 --> 35:49.362
Wake up! Brenda, Brenda, breathe!

36:00.540 --> 36:01.540
Clear!

36:01.625 --> 36:03.292
No!

36:08.090 --> 36:09.882
l got something! l got something!

36:17.599 --> 36:18.975
-That's it!
-George!

36:19.059 --> 36:21.811
That's the last time l try to bring anyone
back from the dead.

36:21.895 --> 36:26.065
George, don't get down on yourself.
l know you were only trying to help.

36:26.149 --> 36:27.692
You're a good, caring person,

36:29.236 --> 36:30.528
which is why l like you.

36:31.989 --> 36:35.032
Thanks, Cindy,
but l don't wanna screw your life up, too.

36:35.117 --> 36:37.034
The most caring thing l could do
for everyone right now

36:37.119 --> 36:38.536
is to just get out of here.

36:38.620 --> 36:40.955
George! What about Sue?

36:42.916 --> 36:46.627
Yes. Of course. Once l get Sue, then...

36:46.753 --> 36:48.421
Wait!

36:50.090 --> 36:53.551
l could really use a friend right now.

36:55.595 --> 36:58.931
Brenda's gone, Cody resents me.

36:59.975 --> 37:03.185
And l'm caught up in something
l can't even...

37:03.270 --> 37:05.521
Oh, God, it's so hard!

37:05.605 --> 37:08.941
Well, you're beautiful
and you're pressing up against me.

37:11.445 --> 37:13.779
Look, Cindy,

37:13.864 --> 37:18.451
l know you'd never consider
going out with a guy like me,

37:18.535 --> 37:21.495
but if you're not too busy tomorrow night...

37:23.623 --> 37:26.459
-ls that a yes?
-Yes.

37:32.340 --> 37:36.052
Cindy, did Brenda ever talk to you
about a tape?

37:36.136 --> 37:37.803
She did mention something.

37:38.138 --> 37:40.097
Do you mind if l go upstairs
and look around?

37:40.307 --> 37:42.391
Yes, go. Of course. Go.

37:42.934 --> 37:45.770
Cody, l'll be right back, okay?

37:45.854 --> 37:50.316
You're getting laid tonight.
He doesn't know you're a guy.

38:49.751 --> 38:51.377
Oh, shit.

39:31.334 --> 39:32.918
Hello?

39:34.379 --> 39:36.755
What? Willie Mays?

39:38.341 --> 39:40.467
Who's gay? Hello?

39:40.552 --> 39:41.969
...me now?

39:42.220 --> 39:43.179
What?

39:43.263 --> 39:45.681
-Can you hear me now?
-Kind of.

39:45.765 --> 39:47.558
-Can you hear me now?
-Yes, perfect.

39:47.642 --> 39:50.686
-Seven days.
-Seven days?

39:50.770 --> 39:52.646
Oh, my God. l'm gonna die next Monday?

39:52.731 --> 39:56.275
Yes. No, wait. Monday.
That wouId be seven business days.

39:56.359 --> 40:00.362
-This is seven days starting now.
-So seven days to this very hour?

40:00.447 --> 40:02.656
My watch broke.
How am l gonna know the exact hour?

40:02.741 --> 40:05.326
Forget hours.
This day, seven days from now.

40:05.452 --> 40:07.953
But there's a holiday coming up.
Do you count the holiday as a day?

40:08.038 --> 40:09.830
WeII, that depends. What hoIiday?

40:09.915 --> 40:12.041
-Martin Luther King Day.
-Then no.

40:12.125 --> 40:14.293
Why not? Everybody at work is taking it off.

40:14.377 --> 40:16.712
Jesus Christ, lady.
I'm giving you seven friggin' days.

40:16.796 --> 40:21.300
I can come over there now and kill
the shit out of you if you'd rather have that.

40:23.803 --> 40:25.679
George, l don't care what you say, man.

40:25.764 --> 40:27.640
l'm signing you up for another rap battle.

40:27.724 --> 40:30.059
Mahalik, l told you.
That part of my life is over.

40:30.143 --> 40:32.519
l said the same thing
about getting with CJ's sister.

40:32.604 --> 40:35.105
-But look at me. l'm still hitting that.
-He's still hitting it, man!

40:35.190 --> 40:37.483
And she fine as shit! That's my sister! What?

40:37.567 --> 40:38.734
lt doesn't matter. l'm done.

40:38.818 --> 40:40.611
So, what are you gonna do
with the rest of your life, dawg?

40:40.695 --> 40:42.404
l don't know.

40:43.823 --> 40:45.991
Yeah, yeah! Come on!

40:46.576 --> 40:49.328
Maybe my brother was right.
Maybe l should just settle down.

40:51.873 --> 40:52.915
-What's up, then?
-Mother...

40:52.999 --> 40:53.999
l got another one, y'all.

40:54.084 --> 40:58.337
Well, George, man, you can't focus
on that shit, man. Let that go.

41:00.173 --> 41:03.008
Hey, you gotta try this shit, George.

41:06.930 --> 41:09.098
-Yo, man, you got to take the lid off!
-What's wrong with you, man?

41:09.182 --> 41:10.808
-Yes, of course.
-Sorry!

41:13.353 --> 41:15.312
-Hello?
-George, something terrible has happened.

41:15.397 --> 41:16.605
I reaIIy need your heIp.

41:18.775 --> 41:22.569
-Cindy, are you okay? What's going on?
-George! George, you have to help me.

41:22.654 --> 41:24.947
l just watched this tape,
the same tape that killed Brenda.

41:25.031 --> 41:28.492
And then the phone rang, and this voice
said that l was gonna die in seven days.

41:28.576 --> 41:31.161
Cindy, there's no such thing
as a killer videotape.

41:31.246 --> 41:32.579
Hell, yeah, there is!

41:32.664 --> 41:34.623
ln fact, l know somebody
who can definitely help you with that.

41:34.708 --> 41:36.125
-You do? Who?
-Wait up, man.

41:36.209 --> 41:39.211
l heard Jamal from 90th Street,
he watched that tape last week.

41:39.296 --> 41:41.046
-And this morning he woke up dead.
-No!

41:41.131 --> 41:42.464
How in the hell do you wake up dead?

41:42.549 --> 41:44.008
'Cause you're alive when you go to sleep.

41:44.092 --> 41:45.676
-Wait. Just tell me who can help me.
-So you telling me

41:45.760 --> 41:47.386
that you can go to bed dead
and wake up alive?

41:47.470 --> 41:50.097
You can't go to bed dead!
Man, that shit would be redundant.

41:50.181 --> 41:51.348
-Just tell me who.
-No, it wouldn't.

41:51.433 --> 41:53.600
'Cause you can go to bed and not be dead,

41:53.685 --> 41:55.352
and you can die but not be in a bed.

41:55.437 --> 41:59.273
But you are in a bed, man. That's how
you wake up dead in the first place, fool!

41:59.357 --> 42:01.358
Damn! That's some quantum shit
right there, man!

42:01.443 --> 42:03.444
-That's what l'm talking about.
-You should be teaching classes!

42:03.528 --> 42:06.113
-You steady dropping knowledge!
-Just tell me who can help me!

42:06.197 --> 42:07.614
-Damn!
-My Aunt ShaNeequa.

42:07.699 --> 42:09.575
Her and her man are into all this weird shit.

42:09.659 --> 42:11.785
They saw the tape
before anybody else knew about it.

42:11.870 --> 42:13.078
Matter of fact,
you should go see them tonight.

42:13.163 --> 42:15.331
-Tonight? Yeah.
-Yeah.

42:15.415 --> 42:17.708
But who will take care of Cody?

42:19.169 --> 42:21.003
George, we're gonna have so much fun.

42:21.087 --> 42:23.172
l have some jigsaw puzzles
and board games

42:23.256 --> 42:26.550
and baseball cards in my room,
and this really cool model airplane.

42:26.634 --> 42:28.010
-l'm gonna go get it.
-Sure.

42:28.094 --> 42:29.511
Okay, so l made him a snack,

42:29.596 --> 42:31.472
and you can give him some warm milk
if he can't go to sleep...

42:31.556 --> 42:32.556
Don't worry.

42:32.640 --> 42:34.308
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-Here it is.

42:34.392 --> 42:36.602
l'm great with kids. Heads up, Cody.

42:38.688 --> 42:40.439
And in case of emergencies,

42:40.523 --> 42:42.274
-l left some numbers...
-l'm okay.

42:43.026 --> 42:46.653
Sorry. You okay, kiddo? That a boy!

42:50.700 --> 42:52.534
And l guess that's it.

42:52.619 --> 42:55.037
-Okay, l'm off.
-Right.

42:55.622 --> 43:00.542
You know, it's funny.
All a child ever really wants is a family.

43:00.794 --> 43:01.877
Yo.

43:02.837 --> 43:05.381
-Cody really likes you.
-He's a good kid.

43:05.465 --> 43:06.924
Yeah.

43:09.511 --> 43:11.387
-Bye.
-Bye.

43:27.195 --> 43:30.114
-Hello?
-l know.

43:30.198 --> 43:32.991
You're Cindy. Be right with you.

43:33.493 --> 43:34.701
Aunt ShaNeequa?

43:35.412 --> 43:40.833
Bingo. But you can call me the Oracle.
And don't worry about that vase.

43:41.126 --> 43:43.710
What vase? Sorry, l didn't know.

43:46.506 --> 43:47.631
That vase.

43:49.259 --> 43:50.759
Please, sit.

43:56.391 --> 43:57.558
lt was the chair.

44:05.024 --> 44:06.358
Yes, the chair.

44:07.777 --> 44:12.239
l know why you've come.
A great mystery lies ahead of you,

44:12.323 --> 44:14.533
but you must not shy away
from the challenge.

44:15.285 --> 44:17.411
Only you can be the one who will...

44:19.247 --> 44:20.497
-Orpheus?
-What, baby?

44:20.582 --> 44:21.623
Sweetie?

44:22.917 --> 44:24.835
l'm watching the game.

44:26.254 --> 44:27.504
Do you mind?

44:29.924 --> 44:31.300
The Lakers will win by 1 2.

44:34.220 --> 44:36.388
-So can you tell me about...
-The tape?

44:36.931 --> 44:39.850
-Yes. l watched it, and...
-The phone rang.

44:40.852 --> 44:44.396
-Right. And then this voice said...
-That you would die in seven days.

44:44.481 --> 44:46.899
-Okay, that's getting...
-Extremely annoying.

44:46.983 --> 44:49.651
-Yeah.
-Try being married to her.

44:49.736 --> 44:52.613
l catch shit about women
l ain't slept with yet.

44:54.741 --> 44:56.408
You made a copy of the tape. Let's see it.

44:56.826 --> 44:58.410
Yes, okay.

45:04.876 --> 45:06.126
ShaNeequa, can you tell me if...

45:06.211 --> 45:09.671
The tape is connected
to the crop circles and the aliens? Yes.

45:10.215 --> 45:13.550
But it's up to you
to discover how for yourself.

45:14.469 --> 45:16.762
-Look, it's a...
-Cigarette?

45:17.555 --> 45:19.473
l was going to say "lighthouse."

45:20.934 --> 45:23.227
Find that lighthouse. lt's your destiny.

45:26.189 --> 45:28.524
Wait. What is that?

45:33.363 --> 45:35.489
Oh, my God.

45:54.300 --> 45:55.759
There we go.

45:57.845 --> 45:59.638
Now, baby...

46:00.431 --> 46:02.432
l knew that was gonna happen.

46:03.601 --> 46:05.102
Come on.

46:06.688 --> 46:09.481
Hell, no. Get your ass out the TV!

46:09.566 --> 46:13.110
What's wrong with you?
l'm gonna teach you not to be...

46:13.236 --> 46:15.320
-Get out that TV!
-Baby, no! No!

46:15.405 --> 46:17.239
-No! Let her go! Let her go! Let her go!
-Yeah!

46:17.323 --> 46:19.324
Come on, we gonna get another lawsuit.
Come on!

46:19.409 --> 46:21.034
She spit on me. l'll kill the bitch.

46:22.161 --> 46:25.205
You won. You won. You won. You won.

46:25.290 --> 46:26.623
-Upstairs. Upstairs.
-Okay. Okay.

46:26.708 --> 46:27.833
-Down low.
-Okay.

46:27.917 --> 46:29.418
-All right.
-Baby, no!

46:29.502 --> 46:32.629
-Kill her! ls you crazy? ls you crazy?
-Baby!

46:33.798 --> 46:35.048
-What you gonna brush now?
-Cool down.

46:35.133 --> 46:36.675
What you gonna brush now, huh?

46:38.344 --> 46:39.970
You picked the wrong TV to come out of.

46:45.518 --> 46:47.728
George? Cody?

46:51.024 --> 46:52.399
George?

46:53.568 --> 46:56.612
-What happened?
-l don't know.

46:56.696 --> 47:00.240
Cody and l were playing a fun game,
and then l looked down and...

47:01.159 --> 47:02.743
Yahtzee!

47:09.208 --> 47:10.250
No!

47:12.211 --> 47:14.004
Oh, my God!

47:14.422 --> 47:16.506
-How could you let him watch the tape?
-l didn't...

47:25.433 --> 47:27.976
-Hello?
-It's me.

47:28.061 --> 47:30.103
-How you doing?
-Fine.

47:30.605 --> 47:33.315
Enjoying your Iast week?
I can't wait to see you.

47:33.399 --> 47:36.234
-Six days now, right?
-Yeah.

47:36.319 --> 47:38.862
WeII, it was great catching up,
but can I speak to Cody?

47:38.946 --> 47:41.239
Why? He didn't watch the tape.

47:41.324 --> 47:44.201
Yes, he did.
Come on, Cindy, I do this for a living.

47:44.285 --> 47:45.369
Leave us alone!

47:51.292 --> 47:52.626
-Hello?
-Hello,

47:52.710 --> 47:56.755
I'm calling from Reader's Digest
with a fantastic offer for Cody.

47:57.423 --> 48:00.342
No, you're not!
You're that evil little girl from the tape!

48:00.968 --> 48:04.179
Okay, you got me.
How about I just Ieave a message for him?

48:04.263 --> 48:05.931
Fine.

48:08.768 --> 48:11.436
Yeah. Okay, how do you spell that?

48:12.397 --> 48:15.941
Right. Okay, got it. Bye-bye.

48:22.615 --> 48:25.534
-l can't believe you let that happen.
-l know. l'm sorry, l screwed up...

48:25.618 --> 48:27.619
Listen, we can still save him.

48:27.704 --> 48:31.456
The answer to the tape,
to your crop circles, is at a lighthouse.

48:31.541 --> 48:34.251
-You think l'm crazy, don't you?
-Of course l do,

48:34.544 --> 48:37.671
but the last thing you need now
is a screw-up like me.

48:37.755 --> 48:40.465
-l'm gonna leave for good.
-Wait.

48:42.468 --> 48:45.554
Well, what should l tell Cody?

48:46.389 --> 48:49.266
Let him down easy.
Tell him l got called away on business.

48:49.350 --> 48:51.309
You'll think of something.

48:51.394 --> 48:53.729
Testicular cancer. He won't ask questions.

48:53.813 --> 48:56.982
-l knew you'd understand.
-George!

48:57.066 --> 49:03.071
Just be careful. Something weird
is going on at your farm. l know it.

49:03.156 --> 49:04.448
l don't know what you're talking about.

49:04.532 --> 49:06.700
Sometimes a sheep just needs
to be pushed through the fence.

49:06.784 --> 49:09.077
-What?
-Goodbye, Cindy.

49:33.936 --> 49:35.103
Sue?

49:35.188 --> 49:36.354
l can't sleep.

49:37.190 --> 49:40.358
Well, it's way past your bedtime.

49:42.361 --> 49:46.490
Won't you rock me to sleep
in your big, strong arms?

49:48.284 --> 49:50.202
There's plenty of room under the covers.

49:50.995 --> 49:52.871
lt's a hot night.

49:53.372 --> 49:55.373
You don't need to wear pajamas.

49:57.293 --> 49:58.376
Where is my daughter?

49:58.669 --> 50:00.921
Are you mad? l am your daughter.

50:01.005 --> 50:02.672
No, you're not!

50:04.884 --> 50:06.635
Come here!

50:06.719 --> 50:09.387
-What did you do with Sue?
-l didn't touch her. l swear.

50:09.514 --> 50:13.141
-l don't believe you!
-Please! For God's sakes, she's a girl!

50:13.226 --> 50:14.351
You sick...

50:35.498 --> 50:36.998
Daddy!

50:37.083 --> 50:40.418
How do you like it, huh? Having fun?

50:57.728 --> 51:00.188
Tom, are you...

51:01.190 --> 51:03.358
What in the world?

51:05.945 --> 51:07.779
Look.

51:07.905 --> 51:09.489
What is that thing?

51:09.949 --> 51:11.616
l don't know.

51:12.201 --> 51:14.744
Maybe Cindy was right.

51:30.303 --> 51:32.554
Please, sir. All l need is five minutes.

51:32.638 --> 51:35.724
And l told you, Campbell,
no more paranoid on-air rants

51:35.808 --> 51:37.309
about the supernatural.

51:37.435 --> 51:40.979
l know. This station is about sex,
violence and the weather.

51:41.063 --> 51:42.731
Yes. That reminds me.

51:42.815 --> 51:45.734
We're gonna need that "Porn Star
Shot Dead in a Hurricane" story.

51:45.818 --> 51:47.360
One hour.

51:47.445 --> 51:49.738
Meanwhile, a tornado in Charleston

51:49.822 --> 51:52.407
threatens a clothing-optional beach
where, just yesterday,

51:52.491 --> 51:54.743
a naked coupIe was brutaIIy murdered.

51:54.827 --> 51:56.578
-This just five miIes from the spot...
-l'm sorry.

51:56.662 --> 51:59.080
...where the Iast naked coupIe
was brutaIIy murdered.

51:59.165 --> 52:01.333
Turning now to sports.

52:01.417 --> 52:06.254
And an eviI videotape that kiIIs anyone
who watches it in seven days.

52:06.339 --> 52:08.757
It's true. We're aII in danger.

52:08.841 --> 52:10.425
-There's an alien force out there...
-Oh, no.

52:10.509 --> 52:12.844
...that's trying to prevent you
from knowing the truth.

52:12.929 --> 52:15.221
-Campbell, are you insane?
-Trust me, it's a horrible fate.

52:15.306 --> 52:16.431
-Carson, l have to do this.
-Do you hear me?

52:16.515 --> 52:18.600
Correction, there really is no danger.

52:18.684 --> 52:21.353
ActuaIIy, I didn't reaIIy mean
anything I just said.

52:21.854 --> 52:24.272
Yes, l did. Every word of it.

52:24.357 --> 52:26.524
Everyone watching this
could be dead in a week.

52:33.032 --> 52:34.366
1-3-4-19...

52:37.036 --> 52:38.078
4-6-9...

52:38.162 --> 52:42.123
I been cIeaning after this
dumb-ass cracker, Giggins, for 10 years.

52:42.208 --> 52:44.793
But I been waxing his bitch's ass for 12.

52:44.877 --> 52:46.378
Know what I'm saying, nigger?

52:46.462 --> 52:49.297
I ride that ho Iike your mama rides the bus.

52:49.382 --> 52:51.132
She likes her some chocolate.

52:51.217 --> 52:53.426
Sharpton for President, y'all. I'm outty.

52:54.387 --> 52:55.553
Peace.

52:56.514 --> 52:59.307
An evil videotape
that kills people in seven days?

52:59.392 --> 53:01.434
Alien forces threatening the world?

53:01.519 --> 53:03.269
And who in the hell is this Cindy Campbell?

53:03.354 --> 53:06.064
lf what she says is true,
we're facing an unprecedented crisis.

53:06.148 --> 53:08.483
-Get me the President.
-You are the President.

53:08.567 --> 53:12.153
Good. Then l already know about this.
Let's order lunch.

53:12.238 --> 53:14.781
Sir, l think you need to go on TV

53:14.865 --> 53:18.493
and convince the people
that there is no such thing as a UFO.

53:18.577 --> 53:20.412
Don't spell in front of me, damn it.

53:21.247 --> 53:24.165
Aliens, sir. There's no such thing as aliens.

53:24.250 --> 53:26.001
-That's not quite true.
-Sir?

53:26.085 --> 53:29.129
A year ago, a UFO crash-landed
in New Mexico.

53:29.422 --> 53:32.173
-A body may have been recovered.
-"May have been"?

53:32.258 --> 53:35.093
Well, there was a terrible mix-up.

53:35.177 --> 53:39.514
lt was Thanksgiving.
The body was sent down to the kitchen.

53:39.598 --> 53:43.435
They shoved stuffing up its ass,
and we ate it at a state dinner.

53:43.519 --> 53:44.978
That's the last l saw of it.

53:45.062 --> 53:48.648
No, scratch that. There were
some sandwiches made the next day.

53:48.733 --> 53:51.359
-Mr. President! Listen to me carefully.
-Agent Thompson!

53:51.444 --> 53:52.736
Back away from that window!

53:53.195 --> 53:55.613
What? Did l forget
to put my pants on again?

53:55.698 --> 53:59.367
No, sir. lt's just a feeling l've been
having since the news about the aliens.

53:59.452 --> 54:01.536
-Something's not right.
-l know what you mean.

54:01.620 --> 54:04.664
Like that feeling
that something's not right.

54:05.916 --> 54:08.043
What is it?

54:08.127 --> 54:09.961
Some old Tupac, sir.

54:12.298 --> 54:16.718
All Eyez on Me. Hey, this shit is banging.

54:16.802 --> 54:19.179
Thank you, sir. l appreciate it.

55:33.379 --> 55:34.838
Hello, Cindy.

55:37.883 --> 55:42.095
l am the Architect.
You have many questions.

55:44.557 --> 55:46.683
l've been watching you for a very long time.

55:49.061 --> 55:50.311
So l see.

55:50.688 --> 55:53.398
But what is the connection between
the crop circles and the videotape?

55:53.482 --> 55:56.943
The answer is simple.
You are the eventuality of an anomaly.

55:57.027 --> 55:59.612
You are inexorably seeking
a sedulant probability.

55:59.697 --> 56:02.490
-"Sedulant"?
-Grotesquery? No?

56:02.575 --> 56:05.785
What about "contingent affirmation"?
That's got to mean something.

56:05.870 --> 56:10.582
Hey! Hey! You put cameras in my bathroom?

56:12.084 --> 56:14.419
l can't... What is this?

56:14.503 --> 56:17.797
Oh, my God. Well, it was a long winter. l...

56:17.882 --> 56:20.550
-This is an invasion of...
-Sorry.

56:20.634 --> 56:23.469
l can't help it. lt's very lonely in here.

56:23.554 --> 56:26.639
Ergo, l haven't been with anyone
in a very long time,

56:26.724 --> 56:30.310
not counting myself, or this chair.

56:31.020 --> 56:34.439
l call her... Linda.

56:34.899 --> 56:37.025
Could you just cut to the chase?
l'm kind of in a rush.

56:37.109 --> 56:39.360
Why? You can always
sleep over if you want.

56:39.445 --> 56:41.529
Linda's built for two, and she vibrates.

56:41.614 --> 56:44.949
Stop it! Just tell me what l need to know!
Who is that little girl?

56:45.034 --> 56:46.451
Okay, okay!

56:48.954 --> 56:52.332
My wife and l wanted a child,
but she couldn't get pregnant.

56:52.416 --> 56:55.376
-Neither could l.
-So you adopted?

56:55.461 --> 56:57.962
We loved our daughter, but she was evil.

56:58.088 --> 57:02.675
Made the horses crazy, killed our puppies,
hid the remote, really sick shit.

57:02.968 --> 57:05.803
My wife took her to the old family farm
and drowned her in the well.

57:06.805 --> 57:09.390
l felt a simple time-out
would've been sufficient.

57:10.100 --> 57:13.061
But Tabitha imprinted her evil
on a videotape.

57:13.812 --> 57:16.898
-l never meant for it to get out, but...
-But what?

57:17.483 --> 57:20.068
l put it in the wrong box
and returned it to Blockbuster,

57:20.152 --> 57:22.237
instead of my copy of Pootie Tang.

57:22.321 --> 57:25.073
And it's been circulating
and killing ever since.

57:25.157 --> 57:26.950
Just like Pootie Tang.

57:28.160 --> 57:30.912
-But what does this have to do with aliens?
-l don't know.

57:30.996 --> 57:33.873
Perhaps Tabitha's summoning them
to kill us all.

57:33.958 --> 57:37.752
An alien invasion? l have to warn the world.

57:37.836 --> 57:40.296
lt's already begun. You're too late.

57:41.006 --> 57:42.548
Oh, my God.

57:42.883 --> 57:45.134
But not too late to make an old man happy.

57:46.845 --> 57:48.888
What? What?

57:48.973 --> 57:51.766
And now, reports of Iights in the sky.

57:51.850 --> 57:54.185
Glimpses of spacecraft.

57:54.270 --> 57:58.231
PossibIe aIien sightings
being reported aII over the world.

57:58.315 --> 57:59.732
Are they aIiens?

57:59.817 --> 58:02.277
The first video images are coming in.

58:02.361 --> 58:05.905
Disturbing home video tonight
from a ranch outside Sydney, Australia.

58:06.532 --> 58:08.950
Watch very carefuIIy now.

58:09.034 --> 58:11.369
There. There it is. Let's see that again.

58:12.997 --> 58:14.580
Very, very disturbing.

58:15.124 --> 58:17.375
And this just in from SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

58:20.546 --> 58:21.713
Let's see that again.

58:27.386 --> 58:30.054
Very, very disturbing.

58:30.848 --> 58:33.516
And this just in from south Texas.

58:37.855 --> 58:41.065
Do they pose a threat?
Only one thing's for certain.

58:41.150 --> 58:44.110
We are aII going to be kiIIed.

58:44.194 --> 58:45.778
We have to board up the house.

58:46.739 --> 58:48.323
Are you sure this is necessary, WiIson?

58:48.407 --> 58:50.575
Having an awards ceremony
at a time like this?

58:50.659 --> 58:53.786
Yes, sir.
Everything must appear business as usual.

58:53.871 --> 58:56.664
The nation, while not yet panicked,
is deeply disturbed.

58:56.749 --> 58:58.333
Right. Good, let's see
if we can steer that course,

58:58.417 --> 59:01.753
keeping everybody deeply disturbed.
We don't want a panic.

59:01.837 --> 59:04.339
Very few presidents
have faced a crisis like this.

59:04.423 --> 59:07.342
l wonder what President Ford
would've done.

59:07.426 --> 59:11.179
Well, if the buck stops here,
the buck stops here.

59:13.640 --> 59:16.309
Thank you, all,
and welcome to the White House.

59:16.393 --> 59:20.355
The Mother Teresa Awards recognize those

59:20.439 --> 59:23.441
who have overcome the severest
handicaps and disadvantages

59:23.525 --> 59:25.777
to help others in their communities.

59:25.861 --> 59:29.030
The young, the old, black and white.

59:29.114 --> 59:31.991
Our Native-American friends.
Hey, how are you?

59:32.076 --> 59:35.787
Hey, how are you? Hey, how are you?
Hey, how are you?

59:36.955 --> 59:39.290
Well, it is therefore my honor

59:39.375 --> 59:44.087
to present each and every one
of you with this symbol of merit.

59:49.426 --> 59:51.552
The room is secure, Mr. President.

59:51.637 --> 59:53.471
-Or is it?
-Sir?

59:53.555 --> 59:55.014
l've been thinking, Thompson.

59:55.474 --> 59:57.558
What if the aliens could
take over human bodies?

59:57.643 --> 01:00:00.353
They'd look just like us, or almost.

01:00:00.437 --> 01:00:02.063
l never thought of that, sir.

01:00:02.147 --> 01:00:04.107
We should be on alert
for anything suspicious.

01:00:04.650 --> 01:00:08.111
-They could be anywhere, even...
-Right here.

01:00:08.612 --> 01:00:11.239
My God. We'd never see the attack coming.

01:00:11.323 --> 01:00:13.866
-lt's frightening, sir!
-Don't panic.

01:00:14.743 --> 01:00:18.246
We'll just move slowly toward the exit.

01:00:19.415 --> 01:00:22.083
At last we meet, Mr. President.

01:00:22.167 --> 01:00:25.378
lt's happening. l knew it!
You'll never take me alive!

01:00:27.089 --> 01:00:28.548
She's scrambling my brain!

01:00:28.632 --> 01:00:29.924
l'll get her!

01:00:33.011 --> 01:00:35.721
No, you don't! Not on my watch!

01:00:35.806 --> 01:00:37.598
Good work, sir!

01:00:39.184 --> 01:00:41.561
Good God! The small ones have metal teeth!

01:00:41.645 --> 01:00:44.105
Jerry's Kids, my ass!

01:00:45.691 --> 01:00:49.694
Mr. President! Mr. President,
have you gone completely insane?

01:00:50.112 --> 01:00:51.279
Like a fox.

01:00:51.572 --> 01:00:54.782
We gotta talk to the one person
who saw this coming, Cindy Campbell.

01:00:54.867 --> 01:00:58.661
She knows how to defeat the aliens,
these filthy, rotten scum!

01:00:59.371 --> 01:01:01.914
You hideous creature! Get off my planet!

01:01:01.999 --> 01:01:03.249
No!

01:01:03.333 --> 01:01:05.918
-Mr. President, is everything all right?
-The exits are all blocked.

01:01:06.003 --> 01:01:07.462
l'll find one, sir.

01:01:07.546 --> 01:01:09.672
Everybody, clear!

01:01:11.842 --> 01:01:14.802
This way, sir! God, this is exciting!

01:01:14.887 --> 01:01:17.638
You're excited? You should feel my nipples.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.558
Cody? Cody?

01:01:21.393 --> 01:01:23.978
Cody, where are you? Honey?

01:01:24.062 --> 01:01:26.314
After today's incident in the East Room,

01:01:26.398 --> 01:01:28.900
the White House is now advising aII citizens

01:01:28.984 --> 01:01:32.737
to board up their homes
and prepare for an aIien invasion.

01:01:33.197 --> 01:01:34.697
Oh, no.

01:01:34.781 --> 01:01:37.325
And now, a News 8 exclusive,

01:01:37.409 --> 01:01:39.660
the kiIIer videotape
you've been hearing about.

01:01:39.745 --> 01:01:41.287
-No...
-We're the onIy station that has it,

01:01:41.371 --> 01:01:45.041
and we're showing it aII night. Very exciting.
Let's roII it again.

01:01:49.505 --> 01:01:51.172
There. Nobody's getting through
that sucker.

01:01:51.256 --> 01:01:54.800
That's great, George,
but we have to get down to the cellar.

01:01:55.844 --> 01:01:57.678
-George.
-Cindy.

01:01:57.763 --> 01:01:59.472
There's no time. Get down to the cellar.

01:01:59.556 --> 01:02:00.932
-Cody! Thank God!
-Aunt Cindy!

01:02:01.016 --> 01:02:04.227
-l've been worried sick about you.
-He just showed up about an hour ago.

01:02:04.311 --> 01:02:06.312
-l tried to call.
-No, he didn't.

01:02:07.189 --> 01:02:10.399
-Okay, but l was gonna.
-No, he wasn't.

01:02:11.235 --> 01:02:13.819
Look, Cody, the point is
you can't just run away like that.

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.364
l wanted to be with George.

01:02:16.448 --> 01:02:19.367
Honey, l know you want a dad, but...

01:02:19.451 --> 01:02:23.788
Trust me, Cody, l'm not good at anything.
Why would l be good at that?

01:02:23.872 --> 01:02:25.373
Uncle George!

01:02:38.804 --> 01:02:40.429
lt's gonna be okay, Cody.

01:02:41.139 --> 01:02:42.640
l'm going to die, aren't l?

01:02:43.725 --> 01:02:47.853
Cody, did l ever tell you what your mom
said about you the day you were born?

01:02:48.605 --> 01:02:49.647
No.

01:02:49.898 --> 01:02:53.943
l was in the delivery room with her.
She was having a hard time.

01:02:54.027 --> 01:02:55.611
Then you began to come out of her.

01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.031
And your mom screamed
and screamed in pain.

01:02:59.116 --> 01:03:02.535
She yelled, "Just kill me.
Bludgeon me with a bedpan.

01:03:02.619 --> 01:03:05.413
"Whatever you do, put me out of this pain."

01:03:05.497 --> 01:03:07.707
She was gushing torrents of blood.

01:03:07.791 --> 01:03:09.667
l have this all on tape
if you wanna see it someday.

01:03:10.502 --> 01:03:12.169
Well, finally you came out.

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:14.380
Your mom cut your umbilical cord herself.

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:17.383
Well, on the second try.

01:03:18.135 --> 01:03:20.136
The first time,
she snipped your penis in half.

01:03:21.138 --> 01:03:24.223
After all, she was drunk. Actually, drugged.

01:03:24.308 --> 01:03:26.934
We'd been out the night before,
celebrating Saint Patrick's Day,

01:03:27.019 --> 01:03:29.437
and she thought,
"Hey, l never tasted crystal meth."

01:03:29.521 --> 01:03:30.646
So she did just a little.

01:03:31.523 --> 01:03:33.608
-My penis?
-Yes.

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:35.276
They sewed it on upside-down.

01:03:36.278 --> 01:03:39.614
-So that's why l pee up?
-Yes. We'll get it fixed, honey.

01:03:39.698 --> 01:03:42.533
lt's on my list of things.
Right after we get TiVo.

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:44.410
Anyway, there you were.

01:03:44.494 --> 01:03:49.290
And your mom turned to me, and she said
"Hey, you want him? Take him."

01:03:49.374 --> 01:03:53.461
Then she died. And l took you.
Do you know why?

01:03:54.713 --> 01:03:58.257
l had just lost my cat in a fire,
and l needed something to pet and feed.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.718
And l miss that cat, Cody.

01:04:01.386 --> 01:04:05.139
But l love you,
and nothing's ever gonna change that,

01:04:05.223 --> 01:04:07.808
not even the very painful death
we're about to experience.

01:04:07.893 --> 01:04:09.393
George! George.

01:04:17.861 --> 01:04:20.321
-Are they gone?
-l don't hear anything.

01:04:28.038 --> 01:04:30.998
-Don't worry, Sue. lt'll be all right.
-lt was Uncle George.

01:04:31.083 --> 01:04:33.167
Well, it's scary.

01:04:34.586 --> 01:04:37.004
Good work, Sue.

01:04:37.089 --> 01:04:40.716
l don't know what stupid, idiotic thing
made these lights go off.

01:04:41.551 --> 01:04:43.761
All right, there's some spare fuses
in the crawlspace.

01:04:43.845 --> 01:04:45.429
lf l can get to them,
l can get these lights back on.

01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:49.350
Quick, George, grab that railroad tie.

01:04:49.434 --> 01:04:51.060
Jam it against the door.

01:04:53.271 --> 01:04:55.106
My balls!

01:04:56.024 --> 01:04:59.026
Not those! Jesus!

01:04:59.111 --> 01:05:00.861
No!

01:05:01.405 --> 01:05:03.781
Uncle George! l'm scared!

01:05:03.865 --> 01:05:05.908
Sweetie, come here. lt's okay.

01:05:08.412 --> 01:05:10.705
There's something
on the other side of the door.

01:05:24.928 --> 01:05:26.137
l can't see anything.

01:05:42.654 --> 01:05:43.821
Oh, my God.

01:05:43.905 --> 01:05:45.239
Can you see them? What are they doing?

01:05:45.323 --> 01:05:49.243
They're horrible.
They're grayish with big black eyes.

01:05:49.327 --> 01:05:51.078
Their teeth are grotesque.

01:05:53.331 --> 01:05:55.458
-l think they're giggling.
-What?

01:05:56.918 --> 01:05:57.960
Oh, no.

01:05:59.296 --> 01:06:00.337
Oh, no, l think...

01:06:02.257 --> 01:06:03.841
l think they wanna eat me.

01:06:07.846 --> 01:06:10.431
-Help!
-Cody! Oh, my God!

01:06:10.515 --> 01:06:12.933
George. Swing away, George.

01:06:13.685 --> 01:06:16.729
-l'm coming, Cody. l'll save you.
-Aunt Cindy, help!

01:06:16.813 --> 01:06:17.855
Die!

01:06:21.526 --> 01:06:24.111
Die! You damn aliens, let him go!

01:06:24.196 --> 01:06:26.030
You're not getting in here!

01:06:26.114 --> 01:06:27.865
-What else you got? Bring it!
-George...

01:06:28.366 --> 01:06:29.867
There! Had enough?

01:06:31.036 --> 01:06:32.703
Forget it, Cody. Thank me later.

01:06:32.788 --> 01:06:35.790
Cody. Thank God. Come on.

01:06:35.874 --> 01:06:38.042
-Daddy! Daddy!
-Sue!

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.632
Mahalik, what are you doing here?

01:06:44.716 --> 01:06:46.592
Hey, man, l told you the 'hood's
always got your back.

01:06:46.676 --> 01:06:48.803
Thank God. There's two of them at the door.

01:06:48.887 --> 01:06:50.888
-What?
-They're gone.

01:06:52.307 --> 01:06:55.726
Good. They couldn't get in.
l hear they can't open doors.

01:06:56.019 --> 01:06:59.480
They mastered space flight, but they
can't get through a wooden door?

01:06:59.564 --> 01:07:01.732
Look, the cellar's the safest place.

01:07:01.817 --> 01:07:03.484
l say all the women and children stay here.

01:07:04.402 --> 01:07:06.987
All right, and the men,
we go outside and fight.

01:07:07.072 --> 01:07:09.573
Right. And what's
the cut-off age for children?

01:07:09.658 --> 01:07:11.408
Come on, come on.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.384
Follow me.

01:07:41.857 --> 01:07:43.816
l'm sorry. l thought l was hitting the brake.

01:07:44.776 --> 01:07:46.944
Now, we don't have to go
through insurance, do we?

01:07:47.863 --> 01:07:49.989
Mr. President, what are you doing here?

01:07:50.073 --> 01:07:51.365
l'm looking for Cindy Campbell.

01:07:51.449 --> 01:07:53.367
She may hold the key
to defeating the aliens.

01:07:54.202 --> 01:07:57.454
Good. The Air Force is here
with those new round planes.

01:07:59.416 --> 01:08:01.625
We don't have round planes, sir.

01:08:02.210 --> 01:08:05.296
Oh, my God.

01:08:05.422 --> 01:08:07.381
Wait. Do you hear that?

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.352
-Yo, what's up, George?
-CJ!

01:08:20.437 --> 01:08:22.395
l told you, the 'hood always got your back.

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:25.733
And l got the boys with me.
Get out the car, man.

01:08:25.817 --> 01:08:28.234
-Yo, who we gonna shoot?
-Y'all ready to go step?

01:08:28.319 --> 01:08:30.654
Well, let's go do this,
'cause l'm hyped right now, B!

01:08:30.738 --> 01:08:32.907
-l'm real hyped!
-You stepped on my shoe, bitch!

01:08:32.991 --> 01:08:35.910
Call me another bitch again,
and l'll park your truck dead in your ass.

01:08:35.993 --> 01:08:37.953
-Calm down, man.
-Damn, homey!

01:08:38.037 --> 01:08:39.371
-ln the cornfield.
-They're coming!

01:08:39.456 --> 01:08:40.497
Hey, look, don't even worry about that.

01:08:40.582 --> 01:08:42.416
Me and my boys here, we gonna
go ahead and take care of this.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:43.584
Hey, yo, come on, let's start it!

01:08:43.667 --> 01:08:46.170
lf l was you, son, l'd bust this shit right now.

01:08:46.254 --> 01:08:48.005
-Your mama!
-l got your number, too, homey.

01:08:48.089 --> 01:08:49.089
Hey! We over here, y'all!

01:08:49.174 --> 01:08:51.591
He ain't gonna bust nothing.
l got nuts bigger than him, ya heard?

01:08:51.676 --> 01:08:54.553
Percival, you country-ass,
maple-syrup nigger.

01:08:54.638 --> 01:08:57.305
Y'all want some biscuits?
You want some biscuits?

01:08:59.475 --> 01:09:00.975
Get down! Get down!

01:09:09.444 --> 01:09:11.444
l can't believe what l just saw.

01:09:11.529 --> 01:09:15.698
These men died for their country.
Send flowers to their bitches and hos.

01:09:20.997 --> 01:09:23.040
l can't break free!

01:09:23.166 --> 01:09:26.210
Think! They must have
some kind of weakness.

01:09:31.383 --> 01:09:32.633
l found it!

01:09:32.716 --> 01:09:36.636
-Without their heads, they're powerless!
-Please, no. We mean you no harm.

01:09:36.888 --> 01:09:39.640
We traveled to your planet
to find an evil little girl.

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:43.102
We must destroy her before seven days.

01:09:43.185 --> 01:09:45.520
You mean you watched the videotape?

01:09:45.689 --> 01:09:48.107
Our satellite picked up
what we thought was Pootie Tang.

01:09:48.191 --> 01:09:49.817
That was a week ago.

01:09:49.901 --> 01:09:54.780
And now our entire race will die
unless the girl is destroyed.

01:09:56.282 --> 01:09:58.993
-See? They are peaceful.
-Well, if they're so peaceful, man,

01:09:59.077 --> 01:10:01.245
why were they choking us
a few minutes ago?

01:10:01.329 --> 01:10:03.288
That's how we say hello.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:05.791
Hello! Nice to see you.

01:10:05.875 --> 01:10:07.418
-Hello, hello.
-Hello, hello.

01:10:07.502 --> 01:10:09.503
Well, how do you guys say goodbye?

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:13.340
l had to ask.

01:10:13.425 --> 01:10:17.094
lf you think that's strange,
you should see how we pee.

01:10:24.686 --> 01:10:27.438
So we're not so different after all.

01:10:30.483 --> 01:10:34.862
There's something about this place.
lt's like l've seen it before.

01:10:37.073 --> 01:10:38.115
Oh, my God.

01:10:42.454 --> 01:10:46.290
This used to be their farm.
She died right here.

01:11:00.889 --> 01:11:03.432
There's something down there.

01:11:26.831 --> 01:11:28.749
-Push back. Follow through.
-Hey.

01:11:28.833 --> 01:11:31.168
-Follow through.
-Yeah. You got it.

01:11:31.252 --> 01:11:35.422
Just look at this.
Human beings and aliens working together.

01:11:35.507 --> 01:11:38.467
We're all just one big galactic family.

01:11:39.260 --> 01:11:43.097
Family. That's just what
l've been running away from.

01:11:43.181 --> 01:11:46.016
Well, that's because you're an idiot.

01:11:56.319 --> 01:11:58.612
This is it.

01:11:58.696 --> 01:12:01.949
My wife took her to the oId famiIy farm
and drowned her in the well.

01:12:06.162 --> 01:12:10.040
The little girl. She's frightened of the well.

01:12:30.603 --> 01:12:31.937
Cindy!

01:13:09.767 --> 01:13:12.227
Time to go back down the well, bitch.

01:13:14.856 --> 01:13:17.733
-Cindy!
-No. Don't hurt him!

01:13:19.402 --> 01:13:21.945
Cindy, you have to come outside.
The aliens aren't invading...

01:13:24.282 --> 01:13:25.908
Don't worry, Cody. l'll save you.

01:13:26.659 --> 01:13:29.786
Wait! Wait. Don't do this.

01:13:29.871 --> 01:13:32.080
You don't have to be evil.

01:13:33.374 --> 01:13:36.126
l know what happened to you, Tabitha.

01:13:38.421 --> 01:13:40.964
l know what your mom did. That was wrong.

01:13:41.049 --> 01:13:44.051
You were just a little girl.
And you're still that little girl,

01:13:44.135 --> 01:13:48.722
just a lot more corpsy
and with really bad teeth.

01:13:49.390 --> 01:13:53.477
But maybe all you need is a mother.

01:13:57.232 --> 01:13:58.273
And a father.

01:14:11.829 --> 01:14:14.414
-We could be...
-A family.

01:14:19.671 --> 01:14:21.546
Thank you all.

01:14:21.631 --> 01:14:25.092
Your love has broken the curse
and freed my soul.

01:14:25.176 --> 01:14:28.428
-l'll never have to kill again.
-Really?

01:14:28.721 --> 01:14:32.182
Nah! l'm just screwing with you!

01:14:34.852 --> 01:14:38.188
l just want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

01:14:47.657 --> 01:14:49.658
Now it's over.

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:53.578
No, no, it's okay. He's our friend.

01:14:53.663 --> 01:14:57.416
Thank you for saving our species.
Now we must return to our home planet.

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:58.792
Goodbye, then.

01:14:59.877 --> 01:15:01.378
Goodbye.

01:15:20.565 --> 01:15:22.774
Hey, congratulations, George!

01:15:22.859 --> 01:15:24.901
You know the 'hood always got your back.

01:15:24.986 --> 01:15:27.070
Yeah, yeah! Come on!

01:15:32.201 --> 01:15:33.410
-Bye!
-Thank you.

01:15:49.260 --> 01:15:54.181
George, l'm so happy. Finally we're a family.

01:15:54.265 --> 01:15:56.767
Yeah. You, me, and...

01:15:57.518 --> 01:15:58.560
-Damn!
-Damn!

01:16:00.021 --> 01:16:02.105
Cindy! George! Wait!
