Oh, Mark! Hello.

27:03.360 --> 27:06.040
I was wondering whether you

27:06.120 --> 27:08.240
about the head teacher position.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.600
What do you want to know?

27:10.200 --> 27:12.520
I would like to put myself forward
for the job.

So we have no choice but to sell

29:05.400 --> 29:08.880
[Mark] Now, I have been sent
to tell you personally

29:08.960 --> 29:12.280
because, as sixth formers, this decision
could have a dire effect on your futures.

You will need to find

-What a waste of time.
-Hey.

Speaking up for what you believe in
is never a waste of time.

You did the right thing.

29:44.120 --> 29:45.160
Thanks, miss.

I was not expecting that.

I think I made
all this bad stuff happen to Jean.

32:58.080 --> 33:02.160
I said some really terrible things to her.
I had some really horrible thoughts.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.160
Jean is awake.

But I'm also really worried
you'll like your new family more than me

It was a stupid kiss.

It didn't mean anything. I can get over--

I don't think it was just
a stupid kiss, Adam.

No. That's not what I mean.

We only kissed, but it wasn't stupid.
