03:43.807 --> 03:45.224
Dad.

05:30.914 --> 05:35.167
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds!
God be with you!

05:35.252 --> 05:40.506
Port side stick, starboard side stick,
move fast and clear those murder holes.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.925
l want to see plenty of beach
between men.

05:43.009 --> 05:46.929
Five men is a juicy opportunity.
One man is a waste of ammo.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.098
Keep the sand out of your weapons.

05:49.224 --> 05:53.602
Keep those actions clear.
And l'll see you on the beach.

06:25.761 --> 06:27.970
Clear the murder holes!

06:44.321 --> 06:45.863
Over the side!

06:52.370 --> 06:54.789
Port and starboard, over...

08:03.984 --> 08:05.234
Jesus.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.444
Thank you...

10:26.334 --> 10:29.378
l said, what the hell do we do now, sir?

10:30.839 --> 10:34.049
Captain Miller! Captain Miller!

10:35.719 --> 10:38.887
-Captain Miller!
-Sergeant Horvath!

10:40.432 --> 10:44.101
Move your men off the beach! Go!

10:44.227 --> 10:45.519
Okay, you guys!

10:45.603 --> 10:48.689
-Get on my ass! Follow me!
-Sir!

10:49.065 --> 10:51.066
What's the rallying point?

10:51.192 --> 10:52.985
Anywhere but here!

11:06.082 --> 11:08.542
The seawall! Move up to the seawall!

11:08.626 --> 11:10.919
Sir, l'm staying!

11:11.004 --> 11:13.297
Clear this beach!
Make way for the others!

11:13.423 --> 11:15.966
This is all we got
between us and the Almighty.

11:16.092 --> 11:20.095
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted!

11:20.972 --> 11:24.266
You stay here, you're dead men!

11:37.489 --> 11:41.033
Mama! Mama!

11:45.663 --> 11:48.165
Stay down! Stay down!

11:52.837 --> 11:54.171
What are you guys?

11:54.255 --> 11:56.965
1 04th Medical Battalion, sir!

11:57.050 --> 11:59.718
Here to set up field operations!

11:59.803 --> 12:01.345
Get rid of that crap!

12:01.429 --> 12:04.515
Grab yourselves some weapons.
Follow me.

12:12.107 --> 12:15.025
-l'm hit! l'm hit!
-Briggs!

12:19.280 --> 12:23.575
Get me out of here. l'm hit low. God!

12:23.660 --> 12:26.745
-Medic!
-Navy Beach Battalion, sir.

12:26.830 --> 12:30.541
l gotta clear these obstacles,
make holes for the tanks.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.960
All the armour is foundering
in the Channel.

12:33.044 --> 12:36.296
Orders, sir. You go somewhere else.
l'm clearing this one!

12:36.381 --> 12:38.173
Come on, Briggs!

12:42.762 --> 12:44.138
Medic!

13:21.217 --> 13:22.843
Move! Move!

13:30.518 --> 13:33.645
Move! Come on! Move!

13:55.418 --> 13:58.754
Shore party.
No armour has made it ashore.

13:58.838 --> 14:03.550
We got no DD tanks on the beach.
Dog One is not open.

14:04.510 --> 14:08.138
-Who's in command here?
-You are, sir!

14:09.766 --> 14:12.226
-Sergeant Horvath!
-Sir!

14:12.310 --> 14:14.353
You recognise where we are?

14:14.437 --> 14:16.855
Right where we're supposed to be,
but no one else is!

14:16.940 --> 14:20.400
Nobody's where they're supposed to be.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.069
Shore party.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.113
First wave, ineffective.

14:25.198 --> 14:29.243
We do not hold the beach.
Say again, we do not hold the beach.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.994
We're all mixed up, sir.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.871
We got the leftovers from Fox Company,

14:32.956 --> 14:34.915
Able Company and George Company!

14:34.999 --> 14:38.627
Plus we got some Navy demo guys
and a beachmaster!

14:40.171 --> 14:43.173
Shore party. Shore party.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.598
CATF , CATF ...

14:55.103 --> 14:57.396
-Reiben here, sir!
-Did you see anybody else?

14:57.480 --> 15:00.274
-Jackson, but that's about it.
-Mellish here.

15:00.358 --> 15:03.610
Caparzo! We got DeForest
back there with Wade.

15:03.695 --> 15:07.447
He's hurt so bad he says
he sprung 1 00 leaks.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.199
Wade says he's all used up.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.535
-Move on to somebody you can help.
-Let's go!

15:11.619 --> 15:14.079
He's battalion surgeon, sir!

15:18.126 --> 15:20.085
-Get his attention.
-Wade!

15:20.169 --> 15:21.670
-Yo, Doc!
-Wade!

15:21.754 --> 15:24.923
-Wade! Wade! Wade!
-Wade!

15:25.967 --> 15:29.261
-Wade! Wade! Wade!
-Too risky, Doc. Too risky.

15:30.722 --> 15:32.806
-Wade!
-All right. Get him off the beach.

15:32.890 --> 15:36.643
l got it! We stopped the bleeding!
We stopped the bleeding!

15:38.187 --> 15:39.813
Fuck!

15:39.897 --> 15:43.191
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

15:43.276 --> 15:45.694
-Son of a fucking cocksucker!
-Wade! Come on. Come on.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.989
Wade! lt's Mellish! Wade!

15:49.532 --> 15:51.199
-Mellish!
-Let's go!

15:51.284 --> 15:52.451
We found Miller!

15:52.535 --> 15:55.120
-Fuck it!
-Let's move! Let's move!

16:02.170 --> 16:05.297
This is all? This is all that's made it?

16:05.381 --> 16:08.884
We got scattered pretty bad, sir.
There's bound to be more.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.220
-Not enough. lt's not enough.
-Dog One exit...

16:12.305 --> 16:13.680
lt's gotta be that cut on the right.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.266
-Or is that one on the left? Shit!
-No. No, no, no.

16:16.351 --> 16:19.061
Vierville is to the west of us.
This is Dog One.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.395
They're killing us!

16:20.480 --> 16:24.608
And we don't have a fucking chance,
and that ain't fair!

16:24.692 --> 16:28.987
Gather weapons and ammo!

16:29.072 --> 16:32.157
Come on, let's drag them in
off the sand!

16:40.249 --> 16:44.169
Reiben. Hey, Reiben, Reiben, Reiben,
where's your BAR?

16:44.921 --> 16:47.047
Bottom of the channel, sir.
The bitch tried to drown me.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.007
Find a replacement.

16:51.052 --> 16:54.012
Bangalores! Bring up some bangalores!

16:55.431 --> 16:58.975
Grenades, grenades! Get me
some grenades. Get them over here!

17:01.646 --> 17:05.648
Bangalores up the line!
Bangalores up the line!

17:05.733 --> 17:08.026
Heads up! Bangers coming your way!

17:08.111 --> 17:10.529
Come on, come on, come on!

17:10.613 --> 17:13.448
-Jackson here, sir!
-Reiben back, sir!

17:14.117 --> 17:16.867
Oh, my God!

17:19.872 --> 17:22.332
One more. Give me one more.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.382
Oh, my God, it hurts! l'm gonna die!

17:30.466 --> 17:34.428
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus! Oh, my God!

17:35.555 --> 17:38.974
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
Almost got it.

17:39.058 --> 17:42.102
-Jesus! Lucky bastard.
-Come on.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.272
-Move it!
-Keep it moving. You got it?

17:45.356 --> 17:48.400
God! God, help me!

17:49.026 --> 17:50.944
You're not gonna die.
You're not gonna die.

17:51.028 --> 17:54.197
You're fine. Don't look at it.
Don't look at it.

17:54.282 --> 17:58.034
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

17:58.119 --> 18:00.787
-Fire in the hole!
-Fire in the hole!

18:00.872 --> 18:06.334
Fire in the hole!

18:15.928 --> 18:19.639
We're in business! Defilade!
Other side of the hole!

18:32.695 --> 18:35.030
That's it! Let's go!

18:38.493 --> 18:40.619
lnspected. Morphine.

18:43.498 --> 18:44.873
Routine.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.339
Priority.

18:56.344 --> 18:57.552
He's gone.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.733
Son of a...

19:12.485 --> 19:15.153
-Get in there.
-Fuck. l can't move.

19:15.238 --> 19:16.488
-Mellish.
-Yes, sir.

19:16.572 --> 19:18.406
Give me your bayonet.

19:38.594 --> 19:42.347
Two MG42s and two mortars.
Add 20, left 30.

19:45.434 --> 19:48.186
There's a little defilade over there,
but it's the perfect fire position

19:48.271 --> 19:50.021
if we get some goddamn armour
on the beach.

19:50.106 --> 19:53.191
We gotta open up this draw!
We gotta get this draw open.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.193
Reiben, Mellish, let's get into the war!

19:55.278 --> 19:58.280
Grab some cover
and put some fire on that crew.

19:58.364 --> 20:02.075
Davis, Debernardo,
Young, Valk, get ready.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.121
Covering fire!

20:09.458 --> 20:11.167
Go, go, go!

20:25.182 --> 20:27.142
Goddamn firing squad.

20:27.268 --> 20:30.437
lt's the only way we can get
everybody the hell out of here.

20:30.521 --> 20:34.733
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!
You're next!

20:34.817 --> 20:37.444
Why don't we just hand out
blindfolds, Cap?

20:37.528 --> 20:39.112
All we can do here is die.

20:39.196 --> 20:40.780
Covering fire!

20:43.284 --> 20:45.035
Go, go, go!

20:46.287 --> 20:47.996
Come on! Come on! Come on!

20:48.122 --> 20:49.998
Go, God damn it!

21:02.345 --> 21:05.013
-Jackson.
-Sir.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.807
-Do you see that impact crater?
-Yes, sir.

21:07.892 --> 21:10.268
That should give you complete defilade
from that machine-gun position.

21:10.353 --> 21:12.228
Get in there and give me
some fire discipline.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.230
Wait for my command.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.363
Go!

21:32.416 --> 21:35.710
Captain, if your mother saw you do that,
she'd be very upset.

21:35.836 --> 21:38.088
l thought you were my mother.

21:38.923 --> 21:41.675
Be not thou far from me, O Lord.

21:46.222 --> 21:50.225
O my God, l am heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.687
l detest my sins
for having offended thee, O Lord.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.313
l detest my sins for having
offended thee, O Lord.

21:55.398 --> 21:57.440
Listen to me, Lord.

22:02.697 --> 22:06.282
All my strength, haste thee to help me.

22:22.091 --> 22:27.095
-Dog One exit! Right here!
-We're in business!

22:28.639 --> 22:30.473
Move! Move!

23:11.807 --> 23:13.433
-Reiben.
-Let's go, Sarge. Go!

23:13.517 --> 23:14.809
Reiben.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.128
The place is full of 'em!

23:43.672 --> 23:45.340
Come on, Doyle!

23:46.842 --> 23:48.259
Sarge?

23:53.599 --> 23:56.684
-Flame!
-Doyle, do it!

24:01.190 --> 24:03.858
Don't shoot! Let them burn!

24:25.840 --> 24:29.133
l'll give you "comrade,"
you son of a bitch!

24:29.218 --> 24:30.885
Lie down!

24:59.081 --> 25:01.583
Cease fire! Cease fire!

25:01.667 --> 25:04.836
Cut it out! Cut it out! Cease fire!

25:05.921 --> 25:07.589
Sugar Cane. Sugar Charlie 3.

25:07.715 --> 25:10.925
Say again, Dog One is open.
Send in the dozers.

25:11.051 --> 25:14.095
l'm waiting for you
to tie in my flanks. Over.

25:15.097 --> 25:16.598
What?

25:19.184 --> 25:22.520
What? l'm sorry, l can't understand
what you're saying.

25:30.446 --> 25:33.031
What did he say? What did he say?

25:33.115 --> 25:36.284
"Look, l washed for supper."

25:40.915 --> 25:42.415
God damn it!

25:48.797 --> 25:50.381
-Hey, Fish.
-Yeah?

25:50.466 --> 25:53.134
Look at this. A Hitler Youth knife.

25:54.637 --> 25:57.805
And now
it's a Shabbat challah cutter, right?

26:07.733 --> 26:09.400
Keep it moving!

27:09.586 --> 27:11.462
That's quite a view.

27:12.423 --> 27:13.965
Yes, it is.

27:15.676 --> 27:17.218
Quite a view.

28:52.022 --> 28:54.190
"Dear Mr Brian Boyd,

28:54.274 --> 28:56.442
"no doubt by now you have
received full information..."

28:56.527 --> 28:58.736
-"Dear Mrs Jensen..."
-"...untimely death of your son."

28:58.821 --> 29:00.738
"...no words of mine
can ever relieve the grief..."

29:00.823 --> 29:03.116
"Our outfit has felt his loss
tremendously."

29:03.200 --> 29:05.952
"He was a fine soldier
and he believed very strongly in..."

29:06.036 --> 29:08.746
"lt's no secret any more
that we were involved

29:08.831 --> 29:10.915
"in one of the most important
operations of this war."

29:10.999 --> 29:13.543
"Al was the one
who held us all together.

29:13.627 --> 29:14.877
"He was always the first to volunteer..."

29:14.962 --> 29:18.589
"...came to a clearing near a road
where over 4,000 troops had passed..."

29:18.674 --> 29:20.883
"Your husband served in a combat unit

29:20.968 --> 29:23.511
"whose dangerous duty
is to place itself..."

29:23.595 --> 29:26.722
"...which we all cherish
and hold so dear.

29:26.807 --> 29:30.518
"The loss of Lee and others like him
is a distinct blow to the regiment."

29:30.602 --> 29:31.894
"l fully understand your desire

29:31.979 --> 29:34.647
"to learn as much as possible
regarding the circumstances

29:34.731 --> 29:36.858
"leading to his death."

30:29.036 --> 30:30.786
Colonel, l've got something
you should know about.

30:30.871 --> 30:32.163
Yes.

30:34.166 --> 30:36.709
These two men died in Normandy.

30:37.336 --> 30:40.171
This one at Omaha Beach.

30:40.255 --> 30:43.716
-Sean Ryan.
-This man at Utah.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.094
Peter Ryan.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.935
This man was killed
last week in New Guinea.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.106
Daniel Ryan.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.734
The three men are brothers, sir.

31:01.818 --> 31:03.277
l've just learned that, this afternoon,

31:03.362 --> 31:07.156
their mother is going
to be getting all three telegrams.

31:10.118 --> 31:12.370
That's not all. There's a fourth brother.
The youngest.

31:12.454 --> 31:14.455
He parachuted in
with the 1 01 st Airborne,

31:14.539 --> 31:15.998
night before the invasion.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.917
He's somewhere in Normandy.
We don't know where.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.419
-ls he alive?
-We don't know.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.217
Come with me.

33:10.030 --> 33:12.406
God damn it.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.076
All four of them
were in the same company

33:15.160 --> 33:17.161
in the 29th Division,
but we split them up

33:17.245 --> 33:19.038
after the Sullivan brothers died
on the Juneau.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.875
Any contact with the fourth son, James?

33:22.959 --> 33:26.921
No, sir. He was dropped about
1 5 miles inland near Neuville.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.297
But that's still deep
behind German lines.

33:28.382 --> 33:30.591
Now, Mac,
there is no way you can know

33:30.675 --> 33:33.594
where in the hell he was dropped.

33:33.678 --> 33:35.638
General, first reports out of
lke's people at SHAEF

33:35.722 --> 33:37.598
said the 1 01 st is scattered
all to hell and gone.

33:37.682 --> 33:40.059
There's misdrops all over Normandy.

33:40.143 --> 33:43.062
Now, assuming Private Ryan
even survived the jump,

33:43.146 --> 33:44.605
he could be anywhere.

33:44.689 --> 33:46.732
ln fact, he's probably KlA.

33:46.817 --> 33:50.486
And frankly, sir, we go sending
some sort of rescue mission,

33:50.570 --> 33:53.155
flathatting throughout swarms
of German reinforcements

33:53.240 --> 33:57.076
all along our axis of advance,
they're gonna be KlA, too.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.641
l have a letter here,

34:23.018 --> 34:27.106
written a long time ago
to a Mrs Bixby in Boston.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.108
So bear with me.

34:31.945 --> 34:33.487
"Dear Madam,

34:34.197 --> 34:36.449
"l have been shown in the files
of the War Department

34:36.533 --> 34:40.286
"a statement of the Adjutant
General of Massachusetts

34:40.370 --> 34:43.706
"that you are the mother of five

34:46.710 --> 34:50.420
"sons who have died gloriously
on the field of battle.

34:53.091 --> 34:56.844
"l feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine

34:57.637 --> 35:01.015
"that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief

35:01.433 --> 35:03.851
"of a loss so overwhelming.

35:05.687 --> 35:07.688
"But l cannot refrain
from tendering to you

35:07.772 --> 35:10.941
"the consolation that may be found

35:11.026 --> 35:15.279
"in the thanks of the republic
they died to save.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.743
"l pray that Our Heavenly Father

35:20.827 --> 35:23.913
"may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

35:23.997 --> 35:28.375
"and leave you only the cherished
memory of the loved lost,

35:29.503 --> 35:31.128
"and the solemn pride
that must be yours

35:31.213 --> 35:35.508
"to have laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom.

35:36.092 --> 35:39.261
"Yours very sincerely and respectfully,

35:39.346 --> 35:41.180
"Abraham Lincoln."

36:00.033 --> 36:01.867
That boy is alive.

36:02.577 --> 36:05.496
We are gonna send somebody
to find him,

36:06.623 --> 36:09.792
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.503
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.643
We expected 32 tanks to float to
the beach. Twenty-seven didn't make it.

36:27.727 --> 36:29.770
-Miller, Charlie Company.
-Go on in, Captain.

36:29.854 --> 36:30.980
l understand your situation.

36:31.064 --> 36:34.149
But if we don't offload
those duel-drive Shermans by 0600,

36:34.234 --> 36:35.442
we're gonna have an entire division

36:35.527 --> 36:39.238
stuck at Carentan
with its pants around its ankles.

36:39.322 --> 36:41.740
Well, you let me know then.

36:41.825 --> 36:44.702
Have Charlie Company hold at Vierville
until we can get some armour up there.

36:44.786 --> 36:46.620
Yes, sir. Runner!

36:53.086 --> 36:55.838
Airborne was supposed to win
an open door for the rest of us.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.507
lnstead they misdropped,
scattered all their sticks into the wind.

36:58.592 --> 37:02.761
-What's your situation?
-Yes, sir. Sector four is secure.

37:03.138 --> 37:04.388
We...

37:04.973 --> 37:10.060
We took out towed 88s
here, here and here.

37:10.145 --> 37:11.812
They'd already gotten four
of our Shermans

37:11.896 --> 37:13.188
and a number
of our deuce and a halves.

37:13.273 --> 37:16.233
These two minefields
are actually one big one.

37:16.318 --> 37:17.985
We tried to make our way up
through the middle of it,

37:18.069 --> 37:20.446
but it turned into a mixed,
high-density field,

37:20.530 --> 37:21.655
little bit of everything.

37:21.740 --> 37:25.576
Spreng Mine 44s. Schuh Mine 42s,
pot mines. A-200s,

37:25.660 --> 37:29.163
the little wooden bastards
that the mine detectors don't pick up.

37:29.247 --> 37:33.709
This road here, they placed
big mushrooms, Teller Mine 43s,

37:33.793 --> 37:34.960
l guess for our tanks,

37:35.045 --> 37:38.547
from here right up
to the edge of the village. Right here.

37:38.632 --> 37:40.591
So we marked them,
called the engineers.

37:40.675 --> 37:41.967
Resistance?

37:42.052 --> 37:44.261
We had higher
support expectations, sir.

37:44.346 --> 37:46.639
There was an under-strength
company without artillery.

37:46.723 --> 37:49.975
Wehrmacht 346 lnfantry,
Von Luck Kampfgruppe.

37:50.060 --> 37:52.102
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

37:52.187 --> 37:55.356
We turned them over
to MPs from the 29th.

37:58.109 --> 38:00.402
What about our casualties?

38:01.029 --> 38:03.155
Well, the figures

38:04.532 --> 38:08.035
were 35 dead, times two wounded.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.372
They just didn't wanna
give up those 88s.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.043
lt was a tough assignment.
That's why you got it.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.628
Yes, sir.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.381
John...

38:23.343 --> 38:25.260
l've got another one for you.

38:25.345 --> 38:28.305
-Yes, sir.
-This one's straight from the top.

38:34.896 --> 38:37.064
You and l are taking a squad
over to Neuville

38:37.148 --> 38:39.066
on a public-relations mission.

38:39.150 --> 38:40.984
You leading a squad?

38:41.069 --> 38:44.196
Some private in the 1 01 st
lost three brothers,

38:44.280 --> 38:45.948
and he's got a ticket home.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.157
How come Neuville?

38:47.242 --> 38:51.161
They think he's up there somewhere,
part of all those airborne misdrops.

38:51.246 --> 38:53.956
lt's not gonna be easy
finding one particular soldier

38:54.040 --> 38:55.207
in the middle of this
whole goddamn war.

38:55.291 --> 38:57.751
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.420
But what about the company?

38:59.504 --> 39:02.798
We take the pick of the litter
and the rest get folded into Baker.

39:02.882 --> 39:04.591
Jesus Christ.

39:04.676 --> 39:06.719
They took away your company?

39:06.803 --> 39:11.306
lt wasn't my company. lt was
the Army's. So they told me, anyway.

39:11.433 --> 39:15.352
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

39:15.437 --> 39:16.854
Beasley's dead.

39:16.938 --> 39:19.732
All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?

39:19.816 --> 39:23.652
-Not that l know of.
-What about Talbot?

39:23.778 --> 39:26.780
-This morning.
-Oh. All right.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.283
l'm gonna go try to dig up
another interpreter.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.118
Assemble at battalion motor pool
on the beach.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.286
Yes, sir.

39:32.370 --> 39:33.746
-Sarge, what we gonna do?
-Okay, listen up...

39:33.830 --> 39:35.205
-What?
-What are we gonna do?

39:35.290 --> 39:36.999
You're going home wrapped
in an American flag

39:37.125 --> 39:39.126
with a hunk of cheese
in your ass, Caparzo, you smart ass.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.961
-Now, listen up.
-l thought you liked it in the ass.

39:41.045 --> 39:42.379
-What?
-l thought you liked it in the ass.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.174
Attention!

39:45.300 --> 39:46.508
As you were.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.677
l'm looking
for Corporal Upham, Timothy E.

39:48.803 --> 39:50.095
Yes, sir. l'm Upham, sir.

39:50.180 --> 39:51.805
l understand you speak
French and German.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.682
-Yes, sir.
-How's your accent?

39:53.808 --> 39:55.434
Just a slight one in French,
but my German's clean.

39:55.518 --> 39:57.186
-Has a touch of Bavarian, sir.
-Very good.

39:57.312 --> 39:58.854
You've been reassigned to me.
Grab your gear.

39:58.980 --> 40:01.315
-We're going to a place called Neuville.
-Yes, sir.

40:01.399 --> 40:03.567
-When was this updated?
-Updated as of 0830 hour this morning.

40:03.651 --> 40:05.903
-Sir...
-This is the 1 2th SS Panzer.

40:05.987 --> 40:07.821
These are the two axes
that advance south.

40:07.906 --> 40:10.365
-Sir, there are Germans in Neuville.
-There are artillery up here, sir.

40:10.492 --> 40:13.160
-That's what l understand. Corporal.
-Yes, sir.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.412
Sir, there are a lot
of Germans in Neuville.

40:15.497 --> 40:16.580
You have a problem with that, Corporal?

40:16.664 --> 40:19.124
No, sir. Just if you consider
l've never been in combat, sir.

40:19.209 --> 40:20.834
l make maps and l translate.
And that's...

40:20.919 --> 40:23.837
l need someone who speaks
French and German.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.672
-Yes, sir.
-My two guys were killed.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.425
Yes, sir. lt's just that l haven't
held a weapon since basic training, sir.

40:28.510 --> 40:31.136
Did you fire the weapon
in basic training?

40:31.221 --> 40:32.429
Yes, sir.

40:32.514 --> 40:35.265
-Well, then, get your gear.
-Yes, sir.

40:36.392 --> 40:38.685
Sir, may l bring...

40:42.440 --> 40:44.942
May l bring my typewriter, sir?

40:50.031 --> 40:51.365
Yes, sir.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.411
Thank you very much, sir.

40:56.538 --> 40:58.872
-That a souvenir?
-No, sir.

40:58.957 --> 41:01.124
Take your time, Corporal.

41:05.463 --> 41:08.006
You should look
on the bright side of things, Corporal.

41:08.091 --> 41:09.216
Yes, sir.

41:09.300 --> 41:12.344
For one thing,
you don't need to carry those.

41:12.428 --> 41:15.389
-You'll need that.
-l'll need that, sir. Yes, sir.

42:13.990 --> 42:15.365
Hey.

42:15.450 --> 42:17.618
You want your head blown off,
you fancy little fuck?

42:17.702 --> 42:19.995
Don't you ever fucking touch me
with those little rat claws again.

42:20.121 --> 42:22.623
Get the fuck back in formation.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.502
l was just wondering
where you're from, that's...

42:32.550 --> 42:34.968
-Caparzo, is it?
-Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

42:35.053 --> 42:36.178
Got you.

42:36.304 --> 42:38.472
And another thing.
Every time you salute the captain,

42:38.556 --> 42:40.766
you make him a target for the Germans.

42:40.850 --> 42:42.643
So do us a favour. Don't do it.

42:42.727 --> 42:45.687
Especially when l'm standing
next to him, capisci?

42:46.522 --> 42:48.815
Corporal, what's your book about?

42:48.900 --> 42:50.609
-Hey. Watch your rifle.
-Sorry.

42:50.693 --> 42:51.944
Actually, it's about the...

42:52.028 --> 42:53.487
lt's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

42:53.571 --> 42:55.489
that develop between
soldiers during war.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.658
Brotherhood?

42:57.742 --> 42:59.326
What do you know about brotherhood?

42:59.410 --> 43:01.536
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

43:01.663 --> 43:04.623
Why don't you ask
the captain where he's from?

43:04.707 --> 43:09.086
Yeah, ask the captain. He'll tell you
everything you wanna know about him.

43:09.253 --> 43:11.338
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

43:11.422 --> 43:13.715
l mean, where's the sense
of risking the lives of the eight of us

43:13.841 --> 43:15.384
to save one guy.

43:15.510 --> 43:18.637
Twenty degrees.
Anybody wanna answer that?

43:18.721 --> 43:22.265
Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.

43:22.350 --> 43:24.142
Hey, doc. l got a mother, all right?

43:24.227 --> 43:26.770
l mean, you got a mother.
Sarge has got a mother.

43:26.854 --> 43:30.524
l mean, shit, l bet even
the captain's got a mother.

43:30.608 --> 43:33.443
Well, maybe not the captain,
but the rest of us got mothers.

43:33.528 --> 43:37.197
"Theirs not to reason why
Theirs but to do and die"

43:38.574 --> 43:40.367
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean, Corporal, huh?

43:40.451 --> 43:42.119
We're all supposed to die. ls that it?

43:42.203 --> 43:44.955
Upham's talking about
our duty as soldiers.

43:45.039 --> 43:47.541
-Yes, sir.
-We all have orders we have to follow.

43:47.625 --> 43:50.335
And that supersedes everything,
including your mothers.

43:50.420 --> 43:52.004
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

43:52.088 --> 43:54.506
Even if you think
the mission's FUBAR, sir?

43:54.590 --> 43:57.592
Especially if you think
the mission's FUBAR.

43:57.719 --> 44:01.388
-What's FUBAR?
-Oh, it's German. Yeah.

44:01.973 --> 44:04.057
Never heard of that.

44:04.142 --> 44:07.436
Sir, l have an opinion on this matter.

44:08.229 --> 44:11.148
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

44:11.232 --> 44:13.442
Well, from my way of thinking, sir,

44:13.568 --> 44:15.902
this entire mission
is a serious misallocation

44:15.987 --> 44:18.405
of valuable military resources.

44:18.489 --> 44:20.407
Yeah. Go on.

44:20.491 --> 44:22.951
Well, it seems to me, sir,
that God gave me a special gift,

44:23.077 --> 44:26.329
made me a fine instrument of warfare.

44:26.414 --> 44:29.124
Reiben, pay attention.
Now, this is the way to gripe!

44:29.250 --> 44:30.500
Continue, Jackson.

44:30.585 --> 44:32.461
Well, what l mean by that, sir,

44:32.587 --> 44:35.255
is if you was to put me
and this here sniper rifle anywhere,

44:35.339 --> 44:38.091
up to and including one mile
ofAdolf Hitler

44:38.176 --> 44:39.885
with a clear line of sight, sir...

44:39.969 --> 44:42.846
Pack your bags, fellas.
War's over. Amen.

44:42.930 --> 44:45.223
Oh, that's brilliant, bumpkin.

44:45.308 --> 44:48.351
So, Captain, what about you?
l mean, you don't gripe at all?

44:48.436 --> 44:50.854
l don't gripe to you, Reiben.
l'm a captain.

44:50.938 --> 44:53.857
There's a chain of command.
Gripes go up, not down. Always up.

44:53.941 --> 44:55.233
You gripe to me,

44:55.318 --> 44:58.862
l gripe to my superior officers,
so on, so on and so on.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.739
l don't gripe to you.
l don't gripe in front of you.

45:00.823 --> 45:02.824
You should know that as a Ranger.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.785
l'm sorry, sir, but...

45:04.869 --> 45:07.704
Let's say you weren't a captain,
or maybe l was a major.

45:07.789 --> 45:09.581
What would you say then?

45:09.665 --> 45:11.458
Well, in that case,

45:11.542 --> 45:13.627
l'd say this is an excellent mission, sir,

45:13.711 --> 45:16.838
with an extremely
valuable objective, sir,

45:16.964 --> 45:18.381
worthy of my best efforts, sir.

45:18.466 --> 45:23.970
Moreover, l feel heartfelt sorrow
for the mother of Private James Ryan,

45:24.055 --> 45:27.599
and am willing to lay down my life
and the lives of my men,

45:27.683 --> 45:31.144
especially you, Reiben,
to ease her suffering.

45:32.647 --> 45:34.648
-He's good.
-l love him.

45:45.326 --> 45:46.701
Right.

46:28.578 --> 46:31.788
-Thunder!
-Flash!

46:31.873 --> 46:35.125
Upham, over there. Reiben, you four go.

46:44.594 --> 46:46.636
Go, go, go, go, go!

46:51.976 --> 46:54.936
-You guys are a sight for sore eyes.
-Sergeant Hill, our relief showed up.

46:55.021 --> 46:56.813
How many are you?

46:56.898 --> 46:59.524
Just eight of us.
We're not your relief. Sorry.

46:59.609 --> 47:01.151
You're not the relief,
what do you mean, sir?

47:01.235 --> 47:02.819
We're here for a Private Ryan.

47:02.904 --> 47:05.447
Who? Ryan? What for?

47:05.531 --> 47:06.656
-ls he here?
-Well, l don't know.

47:06.741 --> 47:09.034
Maybe with a mixed unit
on the other side of town.

47:09.118 --> 47:11.203
lt's hard to get to. The Germans
punched a hole in our centre

47:11.287 --> 47:13.163
a few hours ago,
they cut us right in two.

47:13.247 --> 47:16.750
-What's his name again?
-Ryan. James Ryan.

47:16.834 --> 47:18.210
He dropped in with 1 01 st.

47:18.294 --> 47:21.254
-Goldman, get me a runner up here.
-Runner!

47:21.339 --> 47:23.006
Come on.

47:26.969 --> 47:29.554
Jonesy, make a hole up there!

47:31.098 --> 47:34.226
We got stopped by some intense
rifle action from the eastward.

47:34.310 --> 47:38.021
The Germans have been
reinforcing two regiments all day.

47:38.105 --> 47:40.315
The streets have been quiet
for about 45 minutes.

47:40.399 --> 47:42.901
Most of the German fire now
is concentrated to the westward.

47:42.985 --> 47:44.194
Who's that on the loudspeaker?

47:44.278 --> 47:46.279
That? That's Dagwood Dusseldorf,

47:46.364 --> 47:48.198
our friendly neighbourhood
morale officer.

47:48.282 --> 47:51.284
The Statue of Liberty is kaput.

47:51.369 --> 47:54.746
-"The Statue of Liberty is kaput."
-...kaput.

47:54.830 --> 47:56.623
That's disconcerting.

47:59.669 --> 48:01.253
Take the second left...

48:01.337 --> 48:04.631
Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!

48:04.715 --> 48:07.801
Private Ryan, James,
probably misdropped with the 1 01 .

48:07.885 --> 48:09.886
-Got that?
-Cover!

48:17.520 --> 48:18.937
Go!

48:42.920 --> 48:45.130
-You sadistic fucking animals!
-Get down.

48:45.214 --> 48:48.300
They know we're not in direct contact.
They're gonna single out the runners.

48:48.384 --> 48:50.093
Yeah. Why do they
keep shooting him up like that?

48:50.177 --> 48:52.804
Long as his lungs have breath in them,
he still carries the message.

48:52.888 --> 48:54.597
-We'd do the same thing.
-No, we wouldn't!

48:54.682 --> 48:57.642
-Wade! Get them ready to travel.
-Yes, sir.

48:57.727 --> 48:59.602
-Boyd!
-Come on!

48:59.687 --> 49:02.439
Try again. See if you can let
Captain Hamill know we're coming.

49:02.523 --> 49:05.108
What's the rest of Neuville look like?

49:05.192 --> 49:07.569
Next block's got two-storey buildings,
both sides of the street.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.029
-There's a lot of windows.
-...copy? Over.

49:09.113 --> 49:11.489
And then there's a wide open square
with pretty good cover on the left.

49:11.574 --> 49:13.825
-Show me.
-Sarge, hold right here.

49:13.909 --> 49:15.327
Yes, sir!

49:19.749 --> 49:22.375
All right. Let's stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings.

49:22.460 --> 49:23.585
Try a left hook.

49:23.669 --> 49:25.420
Shoot and scoot,
two of yours, two of mine.

49:25.504 --> 49:27.964
Hastings, Goldman, up front!

49:29.133 --> 49:31.926
-Reiben, Caparzo. Fundamentals.
-They're still jamming us.

49:32.011 --> 49:34.637
Short runs. High and low at the corners.

49:34.722 --> 49:37.182
lt's gonna be tight.
Be prepared for close contact.

49:37.266 --> 49:39.100
-Go. Upham.
-Yes, sir.

49:39.185 --> 49:41.311
-You stay with Sergeant Horvath.
-Stay right here.

49:41.395 --> 49:45.023
l'll wear him like underwear, Captain!
Stay with me.

49:53.157 --> 49:54.616
All right, past the end
of the block to the left.

49:54.700 --> 49:55.825
Those are the gates to the square.

49:55.910 --> 49:57.202
Good.

50:05.211 --> 50:07.003
Reiben, where's the captain from?

50:07.088 --> 50:09.255
You figure that one out,
you got yourself a nice prize.

50:09.340 --> 50:10.965
300 bucks, last l heard.

50:11.050 --> 50:14.302
Company's got a pool.
5 bucks gets you in.

50:18.724 --> 50:20.058
Easy.

50:21.644 --> 50:25.522
lt's around this corner.
Defilade right up to those gates.

50:26.690 --> 50:29.109
Somebody must know where he's from,
what he did for a living.

50:29.193 --> 50:31.027
l've been with him
since Kasserine Pass,

50:31.112 --> 50:32.278
but l don't have a clue.

50:32.363 --> 50:34.155
My ankles are killing me.

50:34.240 --> 50:37.200
l'll need a wheelchair
before this war is over.

50:37.284 --> 50:39.744
Oh, that's it. Oh, my God.

50:39.829 --> 50:43.081
Got ankles like an old woman.
Like an old...

50:43.165 --> 50:44.874
Oh, God.

50:46.627 --> 50:49.796
Reiben, so, you don't even know
where he went to school?

50:49.880 --> 50:51.089
Captain didn't go to school.

50:51.173 --> 50:54.342
They assembled him at OCS
out of spare body parts of dead Gls.

50:54.427 --> 50:55.802
You gotta pay attention to detail.

50:55.886 --> 50:57.804
l know exactly where he's from
and exactly what he did

50:57.888 --> 51:00.140
'cause l pay attention to detail.

51:00.224 --> 51:03.685
Hey, Upham,
careful you don't step in the bullshit.

51:09.024 --> 51:11.401
-Do it.
-Thunder!

51:11.485 --> 51:14.612
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

51:23.998 --> 51:27.417
Upham, tell them to show themselves.

51:38.721 --> 51:41.764
Ask them if they know
where the Germans are.

51:45.895 --> 51:48.771
-What's he saying?
-Something about the children.

51:49.815 --> 51:52.317
-They want us to take the children.
-No, no, no. We can't take the kids.

51:52.401 --> 51:54.068
We can't take the kids. We can't!

51:54.153 --> 51:57.405
We can't take the kids! No!

52:00.284 --> 52:01.451
They think they'll be safe with us.

52:01.535 --> 52:03.703
lt's not gonna be
safe when they're with us!

52:03.787 --> 52:07.832
-lt's okay. lt's okay.
-Are you nuts? Listen to the captain!

52:07.917 --> 52:11.711
-Are you nuts? Listen to the captain!
-They think they'll be safe with us, sir.

52:12.004 --> 52:15.298
Caparzo! Put that kid back!

52:15.758 --> 52:17.050
lt's okay.

52:17.134 --> 52:20.386
-Caparzo! Put that little girl back!
-lt's okay. lt's okay. lt's okay.

52:20.471 --> 52:23.515
Caparzo, give that kid back now!

52:23.599 --> 52:27.644
Upham, how do you say, "lt's okay"?
l can't. She reminds me of my niece, sir.

52:27.728 --> 52:29.687
Caparzo, get the kid back up there!

52:29.772 --> 52:31.105
Captain, the decent thing to do

52:31.190 --> 52:33.399
is to at least take her down
the road to the next town.

52:33.484 --> 52:36.736
We're not here to do the decent thing!
We're here to follow fucking orders!

52:36.820 --> 52:39.197
Sarge, take this goddamn kid!

52:39.949 --> 52:42.116
Cover! Cover!

52:51.418 --> 52:54.337
God damn it! Where'd that come from?

52:56.131 --> 52:59.592
He was on the ground
before we heard the shot.

53:04.348 --> 53:06.266
That's where l'd be.

53:08.143 --> 53:09.352
l didn't see it.

53:09.436 --> 53:12.272
Four hundred fifty yards, Captain.
Maybe a shade under.

53:12.356 --> 53:16.609
l wouldn't venture out there, fellas!
This sniper's got talent!

53:21.073 --> 53:24.534
Please don't cry. l'm gonna take you
back to your mama and papa.

53:24.618 --> 53:26.828
Please don't cry. Come on.

53:30.082 --> 53:31.499
Carpy.

53:42.595 --> 53:44.929
-Captain.
-Hold on, Caparzo.

53:46.348 --> 53:48.516
Help me up. l can walk. l can walk.

53:48.642 --> 53:50.768
Caparzo, stay still!

54:02.197 --> 54:04.490
Two clicks, left wind.

54:08.162 --> 54:09.495
Fish!

54:17.504 --> 54:20.298
Captain, can you see him
from there? How is he?

54:20.382 --> 54:22.342
Wade, you stay put.

54:22.468 --> 54:24.636
Where's he shot, Captain?

54:26.472 --> 54:29.015
-Captain, can you see him from there?
-You stay there!

54:29.141 --> 54:32.769
Damn it, stay down!
What's the matter with you?

54:32.853 --> 54:36.606
Am l gonna take care of you
if you get hit? Huh?

54:36.690 --> 54:39.942
-Fish, come over here.
-Carpy, put your head down.

54:40.027 --> 54:43.196
Why can't you put your head down?

54:50.871 --> 54:53.706
O my God, l trust in thee.

54:53.832 --> 54:55.833
Let me not be ashamed.

54:56.710 --> 54:59.545
Let not my enemies triumph over me.

55:09.348 --> 55:11.015
Copy it.

55:11.100 --> 55:13.434
Copy it and send it for me.

55:13.519 --> 55:15.978
Carpy, you're gonna send it yourself.
Put it down!

55:16.063 --> 55:19.357
-lt's got blood!
-l see it. Carpy, l see it.

55:23.904 --> 55:28.032
lt's to my dad. lt's got blood on it, Fish.

55:56.061 --> 55:58.604
We got him. Stay down.

56:07.322 --> 56:11.534
-How bad is it?
-Chest, maybe lung shot.

56:26.967 --> 56:29.510
Get that 30 up the street!

56:34.308 --> 56:35.558
Detail!

56:35.642 --> 56:37.727
-Clear up!
-Clear down!

56:53.368 --> 56:56.287
That's why we can't take children.

57:02.336 --> 57:05.922
Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check.

57:06.006 --> 57:09.675
Upham, canteens. Fill them up.

57:10.260 --> 57:12.053
-Sergeant Hill.
-Yes, sir.

57:12.137 --> 57:16.516
Gather your men. We'll form up
at the northwest corner of the square.

57:16.600 --> 57:18.267
-Jackson!
-Sir.

57:18.352 --> 57:23.147
Mellish, check the tower,
hustle back here. Right now. Go!

57:34.993 --> 57:36.619
Fuck Ryan.

57:47.130 --> 57:49.549
-Thunder!
-Flash!

57:49.633 --> 57:51.175
Come on in.

57:55.973 --> 57:58.224
Hey, guys, we're looking
for Captain Hamill.

57:58.308 --> 58:00.059
Somewhere down there
across the square.

58:00.143 --> 58:01.435
Across the square.

58:01.520 --> 58:04.105
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

58:04.690 --> 58:06.440
Sit down.

58:23.000 --> 58:25.585
Jimmy T, go find Captain Hamill,
bring him in here.

58:25.669 --> 58:27.003
What? Up there?

58:27.087 --> 58:29.839
How the hell should l know?
Would you go look, please?

58:29.923 --> 58:31.883
Thank you, you moron.

58:33.260 --> 58:34.844
All right.

58:34.928 --> 58:38.389
You guys just flake out here for a while.

58:40.350 --> 58:43.811
Let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.615
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

58:55.699 --> 58:58.910
-Drop them now!
-Drop the fucking weapons!

59:01.747 --> 59:05.791
-l'll shoot you! l'll shoot you!
-Drop! Drop! Drop them!

59:08.295 --> 59:10.630
Now! Put them down!

59:25.729 --> 59:27.146
Clear up!

59:32.444 --> 59:36.155
-Shit. Shit!
-Clear up!

59:37.616 --> 59:39.158
Clear down!

59:51.129 --> 59:54.882
-Enough to make you old.
-Let's hope so.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.353
Fred Hamill, Pathfinders, 1 01 st.

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:10.398
John Miller, 2nd Rangers. Thank you.

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:13.943
We're here looking
for a Private James Ryan.

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:17.029
He's part of your outfit.
Any chance at all you policed him up?

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:20.282
-How was the road in?
-Scenic.

01:00:20.826 --> 01:00:24.537
-We lost most of our ammo.
-Not to mention one of our men.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:28.290
Lieutenant, redeploy that bazooka
to the right side of the road.

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:31.335
-Yes, sir!
-And get Ryan up here.

01:00:33.672 --> 01:00:36.590
Ryan! Ryan, front and centre!

01:00:37.092 --> 01:00:38.384
Ryan!

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:44.056
Here comes our boy.

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:54.567
Told you he was an asshole.

01:00:55.902 --> 01:00:58.195
-Sir, Private Ryan reporting as ordered.
-At ease.

01:00:58.739 --> 01:01:02.116
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you.

01:01:03.744 --> 01:01:05.244
This way.

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:08.873
All right. Take a knee.

01:01:18.425 --> 01:01:21.761
Private, l'm afraid
l have some bad news for you.

01:01:29.436 --> 01:01:33.147
Well, there isn't any real
easy way to say this, so...

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:38.778
So l'll just say it.
Your brothers are dead.

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:43.949
We have orders to come get you

01:01:44.951 --> 01:01:47.119
because you're going home.

01:02:01.051 --> 01:02:03.677
Oh, my God. My brothers are dead.

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:14.772
l was supposed to take them fishing
when we got home.

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:31.664
l'm so sorry, James.
l can't tell you how much.

01:02:32.999 --> 01:02:37.336
-How... How did they die?
-They were killed in action.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:42.758
That can't be. They're...

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:47.471
That... That can't be.
My brothers are still in grammar school.

01:02:50.851 --> 01:02:53.811
-You're James Ryan?
-Yeah.

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:57.690
James Francis Ryan from lowa?

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:00.734
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

01:03:07.659 --> 01:03:09.910
What? Does that mean
my brothers are okay?

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:11.704
Yeah, l'm sure they're fine.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.581
Are you sure they're okay, though?

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:15.082
We're looking
for a different Private Ryan.

01:03:15.167 --> 01:03:17.168
This is just a big foul-up.

01:03:17.252 --> 01:03:19.128
How do you know?
How can you be sure?

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:23.340
How do you know the foul-up isn't
that his brothers are okay and that...

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:25.593
Lieutenant, l'm sorry for the trouble.

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:29.847
l just wrote them a letter right
before l left. l got to get home.

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:33.100
l got to get home right now.

01:03:33.185 --> 01:03:35.686
-l wanna go home.
-Easy, now.

01:03:36.605 --> 01:03:38.147
-So, where in the hell is our Ryan?
-l don't know.

01:03:38.231 --> 01:03:40.316
Are you in touch with your CO?

01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.276
-That figures.
-What unit's your Ryan in?

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:44.570
Baker Company, 506th.

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:46.197
The guy with the broken foot,
he's 506, right?

01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:47.948
Yeah. Charlie, l think.

01:03:48.033 --> 01:03:49.700
-You think?
-Yeah.

01:03:49.784 --> 01:03:53.037
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:55.706
-Where was your drop zone?
-Just inside of Vierville.

01:03:55.790 --> 01:03:58.667
Vierville? How the hell did you
end up way up here?

01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:02.004
You got me, sir. C-47 took heavy fire.

01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:04.840
Pilot went crazy trying to get out
of there, turning every which way.

01:04:04.925 --> 01:04:08.886
Took more fire on the drop.
Got messy. l ended up here.

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:11.013
l haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

01:04:11.097 --> 01:04:12.514
God knows where they are.

01:04:12.599 --> 01:04:14.308
Anybody from Baker Company
have, like, a big mouth?

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:16.185
Talk about where the drop zone
might've been?

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:19.772
No, sir, but l know Baker Company
had the same rally point as us.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.106
Show me.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:23.525
My men are beat.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.569
We're gonna hold up here
for about three hours.

01:04:25.654 --> 01:04:28.197
We'll pull out after dark.

01:04:28.281 --> 01:04:31.200
Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:34.495
Something with clean sheets
and soft pillows and room service?

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:38.040
-How about a nice, comfy church?
-We'll take that.

01:04:38.124 --> 01:04:40.960
What have you heard?
How's it all falling together?

01:04:41.044 --> 01:04:42.670
Well, we got the beachhead secure.

01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:45.381
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:47.716
We can't pull out till he's ready, so...

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:50.427
-That guy's overrated.
-No argument here.

01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:53.305
You gotta take Caen,
so you can take Saint-LÃ´.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.307
You got to take Saint-LÃ´
to take Valognes.

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:57.059
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:05:00.479
-Cherbourg, you got Paris.
-Paris, you get Berlin.

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:03.315
And then that big boat home.

01:05:06.653 --> 01:05:08.195
We sure as hell
could use you around here,

01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.489
but l understand what you're doing.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.199
-You do?
-Yeah.

01:05:12.325 --> 01:05:14.910
l got a couple of brothers myself.

01:05:15.453 --> 01:05:17.997
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:22.334
No, l mean it. Find him. Get him home.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.761
What's with your hand?

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:36.056
l don't know.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.101
lt started in Portsmouth

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:40.853
when they brought us
down for embarkation.

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:42.438
lt comes and goes.

01:05:42.522 --> 01:05:45.441
Well, you may have to get
yourself a new line of work.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:48.902
This one doesn't seem
to agree with you any more.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.534
What?

01:06:00.165 --> 01:06:01.749
-What?
-Nothing.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:05.294
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:07.880
The one that was always walking
around on his hands, you know?

01:06:08.006 --> 01:06:11.592
And he was singing that song
about the man on the flying trapeze.

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:13.385
-Vecchio.
-Vecchio.

01:06:19.976 --> 01:06:21.310
Yeah, Vecchio.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:23.270
He was a goofy kid.

01:06:25.065 --> 01:06:28.025
Remember, he used to pee
a "V" on everybody's jacket

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:31.403
for Vecchio, for victory.

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:39.787
He was so short.
He was a midget, wasn't he?

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:42.623
"How did you get to be a Ranger?"

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:46.210
He got shot in the foot once, didn't he,
when he was walking on his hands?

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:49.254
Yeah. He could walk
faster on his hands.

01:06:50.382 --> 01:06:53.425
He could run faster on his hands than...

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:57.721
Vecchio.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.099
Yeah.

01:07:01.768 --> 01:07:03.102
Caparzo.

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:14.530
You see, when you end up
killing one of your men,

01:07:15.407 --> 01:07:18.534
you tell yourself it happened

01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:24.248
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 1 0 others.

01:07:25.917 --> 01:07:27.960
Maybe 1 00 others.

01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:35.134
Do you know how many men
l've lost under my command?

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.469
-How many?
-Ninety-four.

01:07:38.847 --> 01:07:44.643
But that means l've saved the lives
of 1 0 times that many, doesn't it?

01:07:45.603 --> 01:07:49.022
Maybe even 20, right?
Twenty times as many?

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:57.489
And that's how simple it is.

01:07:58.408 --> 01:08:00.117
That's how you...

01:08:01.453 --> 01:08:04.121
That's how you rationalise
making the choice

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:06.707
between the mission and the men.

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:10.252
Except this time, the mission is a man.

01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:16.008
This Ryan better be worth it.

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:21.805
He'd better go home,
cure some disease,

01:08:21.890 --> 01:08:25.392
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:27.895
'Cause the truth is
l wouldn't trade 1 0 Ryans

01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:30.772
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:32.191
Amen.

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:36.694
Look. There it goes again.

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:40.698
Sir, are you all right?

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:49.249
Now, look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.

01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:51.627
Why don't you get some sleep?

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:54.755
-l don't know how he does it.
-What's that?

01:08:54.839 --> 01:08:57.508
Falls asleep like that.
l mean, look at him.

01:08:57.591 --> 01:09:00.636
The guy's lights out the minute
his head hits the pack.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.304
Clear conscience.

01:09:02.388 --> 01:09:03.971
Yeah. What's that saying?

01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:07.225
"lf God's on our side,
who the hell could be on theirs?"

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:09.895
"lf God be for us,
who could be against us?"

01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:12.104
Yeah, what did l say?

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:16.443
Well, actually, the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

01:09:16.528 --> 01:09:18.319
How is that, Wade?

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:23.367
Well, when my mother was an intern,
she used to work late through the night,

01:09:23.451 --> 01:09:25.993
sleep through the day.

01:09:26.078 --> 01:09:27.912
So the only time that we ever got
to talk about anything

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.456
was when she'd get home.

01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:32.084
So what l used to do,
l used to lie in my bed

01:09:32.167 --> 01:09:33.669
and try to stay awake as long as l could,

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:37.506
but it never worked
'cause the harder l tried,

01:09:37.590 --> 01:09:39.800
the faster l'd fall asleep.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.011
Yeah. Well, that wouldn't have
mattered none in my house.

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:45.389
My ma, she would've come home,
shook me awake,

01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:47.307
chatted me up till dawn.

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:49.935
l swear, that woman
was never too tired to talk.

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:54.022
Yeah. That's probably the only time
she could get a word in.

01:09:58.069 --> 01:10:01.613
Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:04.366
and l'd pretend to be asleep.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:08.078
-Who? Your mum?
-Yeah.

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:13.792
She'd stand in the doorway,
looking at me.

01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:16.670
And l'd just keep my eyes shut.

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:23.051
And l knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:26.096
that she came home early

01:10:27.515 --> 01:10:29.474
just to talk to me.

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:36.898
And l still wouldn't move.
l'd still pretend to just be asleep.

01:10:44.115 --> 01:10:46.408
l don't know why l did that.

01:10:59.964 --> 01:11:03.550
We only got a couple of hours.
Shut up and go to sleep.

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:15.187
Captain? Sir?

01:11:17.231 --> 01:11:18.690
Corporal?

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:26.990
How you doing there? Are you all right?

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:30.160
Yeah, l think this is all good for me, sir.

01:11:31.579 --> 01:11:33.038
Really?

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.290
How is that?

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:41.755
"War educates the senses,

01:11:41.839 --> 01:11:43.799
"calls into action the will,

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:46.593
"perfects the physical constitution,

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:49.846
"brings men into such swift
and close collision

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:53.058
"in critical moments
that man measures man."

01:11:53.518 --> 01:11:56.228
Yeah. Well, l guess
that's Emerson's way

01:11:56.688 --> 01:11:58.480
of finding the bright side.

01:11:58.564 --> 01:12:02.234
-You know Emerson, sir?
-l know some.

01:12:06.698 --> 01:12:10.742
So, where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?

01:12:12.745 --> 01:12:15.080
What's the pool up to?

01:12:18.418 --> 01:12:21.253
You know, l think it's around 300, sir.

01:12:22.088 --> 01:12:24.756
Well, when it gets up to 500,

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:27.092
l'll give you the answers,
and we'll split the money.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:29.177
How about that?

01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:32.848
Well, if that's the way you feel, sir.
l feel it's my duty under your command

01:12:32.932 --> 01:12:37.185
to suggest that we wait
until it gets up to 1 ,000, sir.

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:41.398
What if we don't live that long?

01:12:44.569 --> 01:12:47.654
-500?
-500 would be good, yeah.

01:12:47.739 --> 01:12:49.698
-Yes, sir.
-Yeah.

01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:55.078
-Get some sleep, Corporal.
-Yes, sir.

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:03.897
Who's got sulfa powder?

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:10.445
Medic! My buddy's bleeding!
He needs a tourniquet!

01:14:10.530 --> 01:14:12.030
-Wade.
-Yes, sir?

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:14.074
-See what you can do.
-Yes, sir.

01:14:14.158 --> 01:14:17.494
Hold on, fellas. lt won't be much longer.

01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:19.538
How we doing here?

01:14:20.164 --> 01:14:21.456
All right.

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:24.084
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:25.919
Doc's in town.

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:27.462
lt's all right. lt's all right.

01:14:27.547 --> 01:14:29.047
Don't worry, fellas.

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:31.675
The 29th lnfantry's breaking through,
they'll be here soon.

01:14:31.759 --> 01:14:34.135
Plasma. Anybody got plasma?

01:14:34.220 --> 01:14:38.056
-Captain. Hey, Captain.
-Soldier, you want to fill me in?

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:40.100
Yeah. Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:43.812
99th Troop Carrier Squadron,
carrying in 327th Glider lnfantry.

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:45.480
This one was mine, sir.

01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:46.982
-l was the pilot.
-Private?

01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:48.567
-Twenty-two men dead.
-Private, take care of...

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:51.486
l ended up over there without a scratch.
lt took my co-pilot's head right off.

01:14:51.571 --> 01:14:53.196
Well, where's the unit?
Who are these people?

01:14:53.281 --> 01:14:56.283
Well, the guys we came in with, sir,
they headed off first night.

01:14:56.367 --> 01:14:57.659
Haven't seen them since.

01:14:57.743 --> 01:15:01.788
Meantime, other guys keep showing up,
one, two, half-dozen at a time.

01:15:01.873 --> 01:15:04.666
Then some officer'll come along
and patch together a mixed unit,

01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.210
-head off to make trouble, sir.
-Water. l need a canteen over here.

01:15:07.295 --> 01:15:09.296
We're looking for a Private James Ryan.

01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.631
He's in Baker Company,
the 506 of the 1 01 st.

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:14.050
No, you got me, sir.
A lot of guys come in and out of here.

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:15.594
-Upham.
-Yes, sir.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.512
Check out that squad.
See if Ryan's in it.

01:15:17.597 --> 01:15:19.264
Yes, sir.

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.100
Reiben.

01:15:22.602 --> 01:15:26.646
Smell that leg right there.
Find out if it's south of cheese.

01:15:32.278 --> 01:15:33.612
What?

01:15:39.076 --> 01:15:40.452
Keep moving.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.412
Keep moving!

01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:45.707
l'm Juden, you know?

01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:50.545
Yeah, l couldn't pry him out of there,
hard as l tried.

01:15:50.630 --> 01:15:52.839
-l'd need a winch.
-Yeah.

01:15:56.969 --> 01:15:58.261
Stars.

01:15:58.638 --> 01:16:03.183
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,
Deputy Commander, 1 01 st.

01:16:04.018 --> 01:16:06.561
Some fucking genius had the great idea

01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:08.188
of welding a couple of steel plates

01:16:08.272 --> 01:16:11.566
onto our deck to keep
the general safe from ground fire.

01:16:11.651 --> 01:16:13.234
Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me about it

01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:15.737
until we were just getting airborne.

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:18.823
Well, that's like trying
to fly a freight train. Okay.

01:16:19.450 --> 01:16:22.827
Gross overload.
Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:26.206
l nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

01:16:26.290 --> 01:16:28.416
And when we released,

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:30.794
you know, l cut as hard as l could,

01:16:30.878 --> 01:16:34.381
tried to gain some altitude
and still keep her from stalling.

01:16:34.465 --> 01:16:38.635
We came down like a fucking meteor.
And this is how we ended up.

01:16:40.805 --> 01:16:44.099
And the others, they stopped easy
enough okay though, you know?

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:47.936
We were just... We were just
too damn heavy, you know?

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.854
The grass was wet.

01:16:50.690 --> 01:16:52.816
Downward slope and all.

01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:55.443
Twenty-two guys dead.

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:01.741
-All that for a general?
-One man.

01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:07.288
-A lot of that going around.
-FUBAR.

01:17:07.873 --> 01:17:09.874
-FUBAR.
-FUBAR.

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:12.043
FUBAR.

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:14.254
You all got that right.

01:17:14.755 --> 01:17:16.673
Hey, l looked up "FUBAR"
in the German dictionary.

01:17:16.757 --> 01:17:17.799
There's no "FUBAR" in there.

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:19.134
-Upham.
-Yes, sir?

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:21.803
There's more paratroops out there.
Find out if one of them is Ryan.

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:23.304
Yes, sir.

01:17:23.389 --> 01:17:26.057
Oh, you might want
to check these out, sir.

01:17:26.142 --> 01:17:27.684
Dog tags.

01:17:27.768 --> 01:17:30.687
More than l really want to count, sir.

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:34.733
l've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.276
Jackson.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:39.738
-Start going through those.
-Yes, sir.

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:42.574
l'll help.

01:17:44.785 --> 01:17:47.328
What do you think, Jackson?
Do you think that little prick's in there?

01:17:47.413 --> 01:17:50.415
Well, if he is, l'm gonna find him.
l bet that son of a bitch is here.

01:17:50.499 --> 01:17:52.417
l got big money saying
this guy's still alive.

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.627
1 0 bucks says l nail him first.

01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:57.338
-Let's see who we got in here.
-You mugs don't stand a chance.

01:17:57.423 --> 01:17:59.299
All right, you think this little
shit bird is in here or what?

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:01.092
Just keep looking.

01:18:01.552 --> 01:18:03.720
All right. Gary lanico.

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:05.597
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:07.474
l swear.
All the guineas are buying it, huh?

01:18:07.558 --> 01:18:09.350
Oh, come on, not the right name.

01:18:09.435 --> 01:18:12.437
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's a buddy of yours.

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:15.065
We gotta find this prick.

01:18:19.403 --> 01:18:21.237
Where is this son of a bitch?

01:18:21.322 --> 01:18:23.865
Don't mix them up, Jackson, all right?
Keep them in your own fucking pile.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:26.284
How am l supposed to know
who we got?

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:29.037
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben? All right.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:32.624
-Everybody be friends.
-Cranky there, huh?

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:36.544
-l think l got a winner.
-What you talking about?

01:18:36.629 --> 01:18:38.088
Ryan.

01:18:38.297 --> 01:18:40.882
-Ryan.
-Take a look at that, Mellish.

01:18:41.425 --> 01:18:42.717
You know what?
You're a genius. You really are.

01:18:42.802 --> 01:18:44.636
R-l-E-N-N-E.

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:46.679
That's Rienne and that's French.
All right.

01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:48.848
-You know what that means?
-lt means nothing.

01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:50.892
-What beats three of a kind?
-l got shit here.

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:54.687
-l got all guys from New York.
-l got a full house.

01:18:54.772 --> 01:18:56.898
-Do you need a hand with that?
-l got a full house.

01:18:56.982 --> 01:18:59.567
-l got you beat. l got the straight flush.
-Full house, he's got.

01:18:59.652 --> 01:19:03.029
You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?

01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:05.240
-Ryan.
-Fucking unreal, this guy.

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:07.909
Do you need a hand with that?
Can you read that shit?

01:19:07.993 --> 01:19:10.578
Jesus Christ. Look at this poor bastard.

01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:13.748
-l guess they're not bullet-proof, huh?
-Guess not. All right?

01:19:13.833 --> 01:19:15.250
l don't like
what he's got between his ears.

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:18.253
Sort of like what you fellas got
between your legs.

01:19:18.337 --> 01:19:20.421
-We got to give him that.
-That's not bad.

01:19:20.506 --> 01:19:22.006
Not bad with you, Jackson.

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:24.092
All right, l got three of a kind. All right.

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:25.343
-Full house.
-What the hell are you doing?

01:19:25.427 --> 01:19:27.929
The whole goddamn
Airborne's watching.

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:29.472
These aren't poker chips.

01:19:29.557 --> 01:19:33.393
-All right, all right, all right.
-Put them back in there!

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:58.585
He's not here.

01:20:03.048 --> 01:20:05.425
Maybe we should bust up
into a couple of different groups, huh?

01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:06.759
And wander the woods
like Hansel and Gretel,

01:20:06.886 --> 01:20:07.927
calling his name.

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:11.181
He's bound to hear us sooner
or later. Ryan!

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:14.434
That might be
a little hard to do, Captain.

01:20:15.144 --> 01:20:18.396
Maybe the locals have seen him.
Hey, you know...

01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:24.235
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
1 01 st Airborne?

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:28.114
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?
Private James Ryan from lowa?

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.241
Anybody know a Ryan?

01:20:30.743 --> 01:20:32.660
James Ryan!

01:20:32.745 --> 01:20:38.708
Hey, Joe, doesn't Mandelsohn pal
around with a Ryan from C Company?

01:20:38.792 --> 01:20:42.086
-Yeah. l think so.
-Bring him up here, would you?

01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:53.973
-Do you know Private Ryan?
-You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

01:20:54.099 --> 01:20:55.266
You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:57.018
-My hearing is not good!
-lt comes and goes!

01:20:57.102 --> 01:20:58.311
-lt comes and goes!
-A German grenade went off

01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:00.230
-next to his ear.
-A grenade went off right by my head!

01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:03.358
Got it, got it. Do you know Private Ryan?

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:04.901
Who?

01:21:04.985 --> 01:21:07.445
Private Ryan! James Ryan!

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:11.741
-Jimmy Ryan?
-James! James Francis Ryan!

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:15.662
-No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.
-All right. Get me a pencil.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:18.081
Something to write on.
Something to write on.

01:21:18.165 --> 01:21:20.667
Quick! Quick! Come on, a pencil!

01:21:22.461 --> 01:21:24.212
A small one, sir.

01:21:24.838 --> 01:21:25.964
Write this down.

01:21:26.048 --> 01:21:28.007
James Francis Ryan, question mark.

01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:29.884
lowa, question mark.

01:21:29.969 --> 01:21:32.470
Do you know him? Does he know him?

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.639
Read the message. Look.

01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:40.478
-Yeah. Of course l know him, sir.
-Does he know where he is?

01:21:44.316 --> 01:21:47.694
Yeah, yeah. We missed
our drop zone by about 20 miles,

01:21:47.820 --> 01:21:51.114
ended up way over
by Bumville or some damn place.

01:21:51.198 --> 01:21:54.325
Him, me and a couple of other guys
were coming here to the rally point,

01:21:54.410 --> 01:21:59.580
ran into a Colonel who was gathering
up men to go to Ramelle.

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:00.999
Ramelle.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.543
To baby-sit a bridge.
That's the last l've seen of him, sir.

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:05.545
Great! Great! Thank you.

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:07.922
Write thank... Read, and thank you.

01:22:08.007 --> 01:22:10.508
-You're welcome!
-Assemble on me.

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:14.679
Thank you, Lieutenant.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:18.683
Ramelle.

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:22.395
We're here. There.

01:22:22.855 --> 01:22:28.109
Ramelle is on the Merderet River,
right here, just to the southwest of us.

01:22:28.193 --> 01:22:30.570
You know anything about this bridge
he was talking about, Captain?

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:34.532
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:38.786
We can't push on Paris
until we take a deep water port.

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:40.663
And Rommel knows that,

01:22:40.748 --> 01:22:42.332
so he's gonna try to get his armour

01:22:42.416 --> 01:22:45.793
across the Merderet river
anywhere he can.

01:22:45.878 --> 01:22:47.879
That way, he can hit
our invasion forces in the flank

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:50.631
when we make
the big right turn to Cherbourg.

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:52.425
That makes any village on that river

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:55.803
with an intact bridge
solid gold real estate.

01:23:16.492 --> 01:23:17.909
Let's go.

01:23:27.419 --> 01:23:28.753
Captain.

01:24:07.126 --> 01:24:09.085
What the hell is that?

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:13.423
A radar site. lt's gotta be out of action.

01:24:13.507 --> 01:24:18.302
Looks like we got something in that.
Sandbag bunker right under the station.

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:22.348
-See it?
-Yeah. That's my guess, too.

01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:25.518
What is it?

01:24:26.186 --> 01:24:28.479
Machine gun. Probably MG42.

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:30.857
Jesus. ls that what got those guys?

01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:32.859
Maybe one of them's our boy.

01:24:32.985 --> 01:24:36.362
No, their patches are 82nd,
so your luck's not that good.

01:24:36.447 --> 01:24:38.531
Yeah, well, l don't know how fast
the rest of you betties are,

01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:41.117
but l'm thinking we detour
this way quick and quiet,

01:24:41.201 --> 01:24:44.245
the krauts will never
even know we were here.

01:24:44.329 --> 01:24:47.915
So, Captain, what l'm trying to say is
why don't we just go around the thing?

01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.419
l hear what you're saying,
but we can't go around it.

01:24:53.046 --> 01:24:54.922
l'm with Reiben on this one, sir.

01:24:55.007 --> 01:24:59.135
-l mean, we left them 88s.
-For the Air Force.

01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:03.306
The Air Force isn't gonna spend
ordnance on one machine gun.

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:05.224
Captain...

01:25:06.268 --> 01:25:08.102
We can still skip it
and accomplish our mission.

01:25:08.187 --> 01:25:11.189
l mean, this isn't our mission, right, sir?

01:25:11.273 --> 01:25:13.483
Oh. That's what
you want to do, Mellish?

01:25:13.567 --> 01:25:15.026
You just want to leave it here,
so they can ambush

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.402
the next company that comes along?

01:25:16.487 --> 01:25:17.862
No, sir. That's not what l'm saying.

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:20.740
l'm simply saying
it seems like an unnecessary risk,

01:25:20.824 --> 01:25:22.283
given our objective, sir.

01:25:22.367 --> 01:25:25.119
Our objective is to win the war.

01:25:28.332 --> 01:25:32.335
Sir, l just... l don't have
a good feeling about this one.

01:25:34.838 --> 01:25:38.549
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

01:25:59.446 --> 01:26:02.615
All right, three runners
with suppressing fire.

01:26:02.741 --> 01:26:05.910
Mellish, you hook to the right.
l'll go up the middle.

01:26:06.078 --> 01:26:16.003
Who's going left?

01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:21.842
l'll do it.

01:26:22.803 --> 01:26:25.388
-l'll go left.
-All right.

01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:28.266
Upham, switch off with Jackson,
and you linger in the rear.

01:26:28.350 --> 01:26:29.809
Yes, sir.

01:26:30.519 --> 01:26:35.356
We advance and keep pressure on him
till he has to change out his barrels.

01:26:36.191 --> 01:26:38.150
l think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

01:26:38.235 --> 01:26:42.530
-Maybe l should go up the middle, sir.
-The way you run? l don't think so.

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:46.367
-Maybe l should go left, sir.
-Maybe you should shut up.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.537
Reiben, base of fire.

01:26:57.921 --> 01:27:00.840
Mags and clips where
you can reach them, and...

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:03.884
And extra grenades
for the base runners.

01:28:28.553 --> 01:28:30.471
Hill's clear! Four down and dead!

01:28:30.555 --> 01:28:35.559
Upham, grab the gear. Get up here!
We need water and extra dressing now!

01:28:35.644 --> 01:28:41.357
Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:51.200
God.

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:53.077
Son of a bitch!

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:54.412
All right. The sulfa.

01:28:54.538 --> 01:28:56.163
-Put my legs up. Put my legs up.
-l got him.

01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:57.832
-More sulfa, Mellish.
-l got him. l got him, Wade.

01:28:57.916 --> 01:28:59.333
-You're gonna be all right.
-Listen to my voice.

01:28:59.418 --> 01:29:00.668
You're gonna be all right, Doc.

01:29:00.752 --> 01:29:02.336
How's it look? How's it look?

01:29:02.421 --> 01:29:04.338
Wade, you're fine.
You're going on a hospital ship.

01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:06.340
-More sulfa! More sulfa!
-Put my legs up.

01:29:06.425 --> 01:29:08.676
-Put my legs up. Put my legs up.
-He's gonna be all right.

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.178
-l got 'em. l got 'em. l got 'em.
-You're gonna be okay, Wade.

01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:12.596
l got 'em.

01:29:12.723 --> 01:29:15.433
Upham, give me your canteen!

01:29:15.559 --> 01:29:17.351
-Come on. Come on.
-...we're gonna get you out of here.

01:29:17.436 --> 01:29:18.519
Put some pressure on it.

01:29:18.603 --> 01:29:21.480
-You're gonna be okay.
-How's it look?

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:23.357
-l'm getting some morphine.
-How's it look?

01:29:23.442 --> 01:29:25.901
-lt's all right. You're gonna be okay.
-How's it look?

01:29:25.986 --> 01:29:27.695
You're gonna be okay.

01:29:27.779 --> 01:29:29.655
Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.

01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:32.783
Am l shot in the spine?

01:29:32.909 --> 01:29:35.453
-You're okay, Wade.
-Am l shot in the spine?

01:29:35.579 --> 01:29:37.621
-Lift him up. Easy, easy, easy.
-All right. Flip him over.

01:29:37.748 --> 01:29:38.914
-Easy, easy, easy.
-Put some pressure.

01:29:38.999 --> 01:29:41.584
-Easy, easy.
-Lift him up. Lift him up.

01:29:44.129 --> 01:29:47.131
lt's okay, doc. lt's all right.

01:29:47.257 --> 01:29:49.759
Wade, you got an exit wound.

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:51.594
lt's in the small of your back.

01:29:51.678 --> 01:29:54.013
How big's the hole in the...

01:29:54.139 --> 01:29:56.056
-About the size of an acorn.
-lt's fine.

01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:58.184
You're fine. You're fine.

01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:03.689
Put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure on it.

01:30:03.815 --> 01:30:07.985
-Put some pressure on it.
-lt's all right.

01:30:08.111 --> 01:30:10.821
Put some more pressure on it!

01:30:11.323 --> 01:30:13.699
ls there anything bleeding
worse than the others?

01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:15.576
Yeah, right here, right here.
Do you know what it is?

01:30:15.660 --> 01:30:17.077
-No.
-Right here. Yeah. Right here.

01:30:17.162 --> 01:30:18.788
l'm gonna put your hand on it.

01:30:18.872 --> 01:30:20.664
-We got some pressure on there.
-Right there.

01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.917
-That's good.
-Okay. That's the one.

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:24.794
Oh, my God, my liver!

01:30:24.878 --> 01:30:27.797
-Oh, my God! lt's my liver!
-Something wrong, Wade.

01:30:27.881 --> 01:30:29.256
Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you.

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:31.217
What do you need? What do you need?
What can we do, Wade?

01:30:31.343 --> 01:30:33.552
Tell us what to do.

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:34.929
Oh, shit.

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:39.517
l could use... l could use
a little more morphine.

01:30:40.227 --> 01:30:42.019
More morphine, sir?

01:30:43.021 --> 01:30:45.481
Okay. Okay.

01:30:49.152 --> 01:30:54.698
Give it to him.

01:30:59.037 --> 01:31:01.747
-l don't wanna die.
-Here you go. Wade, here you go.

01:31:01.873 --> 01:31:05.292
-Here it comes.
-There you go. There you...

01:31:08.588 --> 01:31:10.548
Give him another one.

01:31:17.639 --> 01:31:22.893
Mama?

01:31:23.728 --> 01:31:26.647
l want to go home. l want to go home.

01:31:28.275 --> 01:31:31.277
Mama. Mama.

01:31:31.403 --> 01:31:34.238
Mama, Mama, Mama...

01:32:17.032 --> 01:32:18.782
Reiben, hold him!

01:32:39.512 --> 01:32:40.888
Not yet.

01:32:43.475 --> 01:32:47.478
First, make him mark and cover
Wade's body for grave detail.

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:50.981
Same thing
for those paratroopers down there.

01:32:51.399 --> 01:32:53.859
Strip that stuff off
and check him for intelligence.

01:32:53.944 --> 01:32:58.155
Ask this piece of shit
if he's the one who shot Wade. Ask him!

01:32:58.239 --> 01:33:00.950
-lt doesn't matter.
-lt does matter!

01:33:03.370 --> 01:33:05.955
Shut up with that filthy pig latin.

01:33:08.041 --> 01:33:09.959
Jackson, you're hit.

01:33:12.128 --> 01:33:13.379
Shit.

01:33:13.964 --> 01:33:17.299
-l guess it just skinned the arm, sir.
-Get it cleaned and dressed.

01:33:17.384 --> 01:33:19.927
You and Sarge, watch the perimeter.

01:33:22.973 --> 01:33:27.518
-Sir, he says, "Please don't shoot."
-l don't care what he says, Upham.

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:31.313
Sir? Sir, you're gonna let them kill him?

01:33:32.315 --> 01:33:36.568
-This is not right, sir.
-You can help him with the bodies.

01:33:38.905 --> 01:33:40.739
What is happening?

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:32.601
American.

01:35:34.521 --> 01:35:36.271
l like American.

01:35:43.822 --> 01:35:47.741
Steamboat Willie.

01:35:47.826 --> 01:35:50.494
Yeah, Steamboat WiIIie. American.

01:36:02.006 --> 01:36:04.383
-He's says he's not finished.
-Yeah. That's what you think.

01:36:04.467 --> 01:36:06.218
Come on. Yeah.

01:36:16.146 --> 01:36:19.523
Please... l like America.

01:36:20.859 --> 01:36:23.068
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

01:36:23.153 --> 01:36:26.822
Go fly a kite!
Cat got your tongue? Cool beans!

01:36:30.535 --> 01:36:32.703
Betty Boop! What a dish!

01:36:33.705 --> 01:36:36.498
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

01:36:43.173 --> 01:36:48.385
l say can you see
l say can you see

01:36:48.845 --> 01:36:50.971
l say...

01:36:57.979 --> 01:37:03.275
Fuck Hitler.

01:37:12.118 --> 01:37:14.703
Sir, he says he's sorry about Wade.

01:37:14.787 --> 01:37:16.830
He says he's sorry about Wade, sir.

01:37:16.915 --> 01:37:18.582
Captain.

01:37:18.708 --> 01:37:20.584
Captain, this isn't right.

01:37:20.668 --> 01:37:24.213
You know this. He's a prisoner.
He surrendered.

01:37:24.923 --> 01:37:26.882
He surrendered, sir!

01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:39.269
Tell him

01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:44.608
to march 1 ,000 paces in that direction,

01:37:44.734 --> 01:37:45.943
then he can take off the blindfold.

01:37:46.069 --> 01:37:47.110
We'll be gone, and he turns himself in

01:37:47.237 --> 01:37:49.029
to the first Allied patrol
he comes across.

01:37:49.113 --> 01:37:50.113
-Thank you, sir.
-You gotta be kidding me.

01:37:50.240 --> 01:37:53.033
-We're letting him go?
-He's a POW, Reiben.

01:37:53.117 --> 01:37:57.454
Can't take him with us.
Our guys'll pick him up sooner or later.

01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:10.384
Only if he doesn't get picked up
by his own Wehrmacht first,

01:38:10.468 --> 01:38:13.136
then thrown back into circulation.

01:38:15.306 --> 01:38:17.724
Captain, you just let the enemy go.

01:38:17.809 --> 01:38:20.727
-This is such bullshit.
-Y'all got that right.

01:38:20.812 --> 01:38:22.813
Bullshit? Right. This is bullshit?

01:38:22.939 --> 01:38:24.982
-Shooting a prisoner, that'd be okay?
-Upham, shut your mouth.

01:38:25.108 --> 01:38:26.149
lt's against the goddamn rules!

01:38:26.276 --> 01:38:30.320
Yeah. The goddamn rules
just walked off with your new friend.

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:36.493
But l guess that was
the decent thing to do, huh, Captain?

01:38:43.293 --> 01:38:45.627
Get your gear. Let's go.

01:38:48.089 --> 01:38:50.173
You heard him. Gear up.

01:38:51.509 --> 01:38:53.343
The Captain just gave you an order.

01:38:53.428 --> 01:38:57.264
Yeah. Like the one he gave
to take this machine gun.

01:38:57.348 --> 01:39:00.475
-That was a real doozy, wasn't it, Sarge.
-Soldier, you are way out of line.

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:03.812
Yes, sir. That was one hell of a call,
coming to take this nest,

01:39:03.896 --> 01:39:06.648
but what the hell? We only lost
one of our guys, going for it.

01:39:06.733 --> 01:39:09.067
l swear, l hope Mama Ryan's
real fucking happy,

01:39:09.193 --> 01:39:12.738
knowing that little Jimmy's life is a little
bit more important than two of our guys!

01:39:12.864 --> 01:39:15.824
But then again, we haven't
found him yet, have we? Huh?

01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:19.244
-Here you go.
-Get the hell off me!

01:39:19.370 --> 01:39:21.079
Reiben, get up.

01:39:22.874 --> 01:39:26.001
Gear up. Fall in.

01:39:31.049 --> 01:39:33.258
l'm done with this mission.

01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:39.890
Hey! Hey!

01:39:41.851 --> 01:39:43.894
-Sir.
-Don't walk away from your Captain.

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:46.271
-Reiben, get back in line.
-No, sir.

01:39:46.397 --> 01:39:47.731
l'll spend the rest
of my life in the stockade

01:39:47.857 --> 01:39:49.149
if l have to, but l'm done with this.

01:39:49.233 --> 01:39:51.526
-l'm not gonna ask you again, soldier.
-Captain!

01:39:51.611 --> 01:39:52.944
All right, now. This is bullshit!

01:39:53.071 --> 01:39:55.530
-Fall in!
-You're gonna shoot me over Ryan?

01:39:55.615 --> 01:39:56.990
No. l'm gonna shoot you
'cause l don't like you.

01:39:57.075 --> 01:40:00.035
-Sir, listen...
-Sir, if he wants to go, just let him go!

01:40:00.119 --> 01:40:03.455
Are you letting this happen?
Captain! You see this?

01:40:03.581 --> 01:40:06.625
-Captain? Sir? Sir, Ryan's dead.
-Bullshit!

01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:09.169
-Sir, we have a situation you might...
-That is bullshit!

01:40:09.253 --> 01:40:11.755
Captain, l have a sixth sense about
these things. l know it in my bones.

01:40:11.881 --> 01:40:14.758
We don't kill that son-of-a-bitch kraut.
Now you're gonna shoot me?

01:40:14.884 --> 01:40:17.302
-He's better than you.
-Then why don't you just do it, Sarge?

01:40:17.428 --> 01:40:19.096
Do it, man. Put one in my leg
and give me that...

01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:21.848
l'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!

01:40:21.933 --> 01:40:23.350
Well, put your money
where your mouth is...

01:40:23.434 --> 01:40:24.851
-You don't know when to shut up.
-Do it!

01:40:24.936 --> 01:40:26.520
-You don't know how to shut up.
-Pull the trigger, already!

01:40:26.604 --> 01:40:27.938
Captain, please!

01:40:28.064 --> 01:40:31.274
-What's the pool on me up to?
-What?

01:40:31.401 --> 01:40:34.111
-You are a coward son of a bitch!
-l'm waiting, Sarge.

01:40:34.195 --> 01:40:37.864
Mike, what's the pool
on me up to right now?

01:40:37.949 --> 01:40:39.741
What's it up to?

01:40:40.368 --> 01:40:44.955
What is it, $300? ls that it? 300?
l'm a schoolteacher.

01:40:49.544 --> 01:40:51.795
l teach English composition

01:40:53.131 --> 01:40:55.298
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

01:40:55.383 --> 01:40:57.134
The last 1 1 years,

01:40:57.969 --> 01:41:00.971
l've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:06.560
l was the coach of the baseball team
in the springtime.

01:41:09.105 --> 01:41:10.772
l'll be doggone.

01:41:11.482 --> 01:41:14.734
Back home, when l'd tell people
what l do for a living,

01:41:14.819 --> 01:41:17.737
they'd think, "Well, that figures."

01:41:19.615 --> 01:41:21.825
But over here, it's a...

01:41:23.453 --> 01:41:25.120
A big...

01:41:26.372 --> 01:41:28.039
A big mystery.

01:41:29.083 --> 01:41:31.793
So l guess l've changed some.

01:41:34.505 --> 01:41:37.674
Sometimes l wonder
if l've changed so much

01:41:37.758 --> 01:41:42.304
my wife is even going to recognise me
whenever it is l get back to her.

01:41:43.848 --> 01:41:46.391
And how l'll ever be able to...

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:51.563
To tell her about days like today.

01:41:54.817 --> 01:41:56.193
Ryan...

01:41:57.278 --> 01:42:00.447
l don't know anything about Ryan.
l don't care.

01:42:01.115 --> 01:42:04.784
The man means nothing to me,
it's just a name. But if...

01:42:06.621 --> 01:42:09.122
You know, if going to Ramelle

01:42:09.248 --> 01:42:10.790
and finding him, so he can go home,

01:42:10.875 --> 01:42:12.501
if that earns me the right
to get back to my wife

01:42:12.585 --> 01:42:16.880
well, then... Then that's my mission.

01:42:18.925 --> 01:42:20.509
You want to leave?

01:42:20.593 --> 01:42:23.637
You want to go off and fight the war?

01:42:26.516 --> 01:42:27.974
All right.

01:42:29.310 --> 01:42:31.853
All right, l won't stop you.

01:42:31.938 --> 01:42:34.523
l'll even put in the paperwork.

01:42:36.484 --> 01:42:40.862
l just know that every man l kill,
the farther away from home l feel.

01:44:06.073 --> 01:44:07.657
By memories

01:44:08.993 --> 01:44:11.036
Of the days gone by

01:44:12.872 --> 01:44:14.664
ln my solitude

01:44:15.583 --> 01:44:18.043
You taunt me

01:44:18.127 --> 01:44:21.671
With memories that never die

01:44:22.882 --> 01:44:25.342
l sit in my chair

01:44:25.426 --> 01:44:27.636
filled with despair

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:29.554
There's no one

01:44:29.639 --> 01:44:32.057
could be so sad

01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:34.976
with gloom everywhere

01:44:35.061 --> 01:44:37.687
I sit and I stare...

01:44:51.577 --> 01:44:53.662
Halftrack! Cover!

01:45:09.345 --> 01:45:12.889
Who's doing the shooting?
Who's doing the shooting?

01:45:33.786 --> 01:45:36.162
Get ready to move on their left flank!
Take their left flank!

01:45:36.247 --> 01:45:39.124
Hold on and make sure they're down!

01:46:00.271 --> 01:46:02.897
1 01 st! We're coming out!

01:46:10.322 --> 01:46:13.283
That was a recon element, 2nd SS.

01:46:14.618 --> 01:46:18.204
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

01:46:20.082 --> 01:46:23.501
Captain Miller,
Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

01:46:23.586 --> 01:46:25.670
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, 501 st.

01:46:25.755 --> 01:46:27.255
Ryan. First of the 506th.

01:46:27.339 --> 01:46:29.716
PFC Toynbe, Third of the 506th.

01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:31.760
James Francis Ryan?

01:46:31.844 --> 01:46:34.345
Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?

01:46:46.108 --> 01:46:49.068
Looks like you guys got hit pretty hard.

01:46:49.153 --> 01:46:52.697
Yes, sir. Small unit action.

01:46:55.117 --> 01:46:58.703
They came in,
and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

01:47:04.919 --> 01:47:08.463
Tell you what, sir, if you're our relief,
l'm gonna file a complaint.

01:47:08.547 --> 01:47:10.507
l wouldn't blame you.

01:47:11.258 --> 01:47:13.009
Who's your CO?

01:47:14.595 --> 01:47:17.388
lt would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

01:47:17.473 --> 01:47:21.935
l'm afraid the best we can muster up
right now is a corporal.

01:47:22.019 --> 01:47:24.562
So, what are you guys all about?

01:47:25.147 --> 01:47:27.649
We're here for him. Ryan.

01:47:28.984 --> 01:47:30.443
Me, sir?

01:47:39.787 --> 01:47:42.163
James Francis Ryan of lowa?

01:47:42.998 --> 01:47:46.459
Yes, sir.
Payton, lowa, that's correct, but...

01:47:46.544 --> 01:47:48.545
What is this about?

01:47:50.381 --> 01:47:53.174
Your brothers were killed in combat.

01:47:59.974 --> 01:48:01.599
Which ones?

01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:06.020
All of them.

01:48:15.906 --> 01:48:17.490
On the level?

01:48:18.909 --> 01:48:20.869
Yeah. l'm afraid so.

01:48:23.622 --> 01:48:25.582
You might want to take
some time with this.

01:48:25.666 --> 01:48:28.710
lf there's someplace
you want to go and...

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:40.638
-What's this all about?
-Ryan lost his brothers.

01:48:40.723 --> 01:48:43.099
-Which one?
-All of them.

01:48:48.063 --> 01:48:49.439
You...

01:48:52.067 --> 01:48:55.361
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

01:48:57.072 --> 01:48:59.240
Well, you're going home.

01:49:00.743 --> 01:49:03.328
Our orders are to bring you back.

01:49:06.624 --> 01:49:08.249
Bring me back?

01:49:10.628 --> 01:49:14.130
Corporal Henderson, l don't mean
to leave you even more shorthanded,

01:49:14.214 --> 01:49:15.548
but orders are orders.

01:49:15.633 --> 01:49:18.468
Any communication about when
you're going to be relieved up here?

01:49:18.594 --> 01:49:19.802
Sir, there's no way to tell. l mean,

01:49:19.929 --> 01:49:21.471
we have no idea
what's happening south of us.

01:49:21.555 --> 01:49:22.889
l have my orders, too, sir.

01:49:22.973 --> 01:49:24.891
They don't include me
abandoning my post.

01:49:24.975 --> 01:49:27.894
l understand that,
but this changes things.

01:49:27.978 --> 01:49:30.313
l don't see that it does, sir.

01:49:31.941 --> 01:49:34.984
The Chief of Staff
for the United States Army says it does.

01:49:35.069 --> 01:49:37.904
Sir, our orders are to hold
this bridge at all cost.

01:49:37.988 --> 01:49:40.490
Now, our planes in the 82nd
have taken out every bridge

01:49:40.616 --> 01:49:42.575
across the Merderet
with the exception of two.

01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:44.243
One at Valognes and this one here.

01:49:44.328 --> 01:49:45.578
We let the Germans take them,

01:49:45.663 --> 01:49:47.246
we're gonna lose our foothold
and have to displace.

01:49:47.331 --> 01:49:50.833
Private, your outfit wants to stay,
that's one thing.

01:49:50.918 --> 01:49:52.001
But your party's over here.

01:49:52.086 --> 01:49:54.253
Sir, l can't leave
until at least reinforcements...

01:49:54.338 --> 01:49:56.756
You got three minutes
to gather your gear.

01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.925
Sir, what about them?
l mean, there's barely hardly enough...

01:49:59.009 --> 01:50:00.510
Hey, asshole!

01:50:01.261 --> 01:50:05.139
Two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

01:50:10.187 --> 01:50:12.855
-Sir?
-That's right.

01:50:22.741 --> 01:50:27.245
-What were their names?
-lrwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

01:50:29.206 --> 01:50:30.748
Wade and...

01:50:32.251 --> 01:50:33.710
Caparzo.

01:50:46.098 --> 01:50:48.516
lt doesn't make any sense.

01:50:50.602 --> 01:50:54.856
lt doesn't make sense, sir.
Why? Why do l deserve to go?

01:50:54.940 --> 01:50:59.110
Why not any of these guys?
They all fought just as hard as me!

01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:05.825
ls that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

01:51:05.909 --> 01:51:09.245
when they send her another
folded American flag?

01:51:16.462 --> 01:51:18.880
Tell her that when you found me,

01:51:18.964 --> 01:51:22.633
l was here and l was
with the only brothers that l have left,

01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:25.970
and that there's no way
l was gonna desert them.

01:51:27.139 --> 01:51:29.307
l think she'll understand that.

01:51:29.433 --> 01:51:32.393
There's no way l'm leaving this bridge.

01:52:15.395 --> 01:52:17.480
What are your orders?

01:52:19.316 --> 01:52:22.652
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

01:52:23.654 --> 01:52:26.239
The world has taken a turn
for the surreal.

01:52:26.323 --> 01:52:29.158
Clearly, but the question still stands.

01:52:29.827 --> 01:52:32.829
l don't know. What do you think?

01:52:33.872 --> 01:52:36.666
You don't want to know what l think.

01:52:38.544 --> 01:52:40.211
No, Mike, l do.

01:52:41.922 --> 01:52:45.216
Well, part of me thinks the kid's right.

01:52:45.342 --> 01:52:47.844
What's he done to deserve this?

01:52:47.928 --> 01:52:51.889
He wants to stay here, fine,
let's leave him and go home.

01:52:53.183 --> 01:52:54.433
Yeah.

01:52:55.018 --> 01:53:00.106
But another part of me thinks
what if, by some miracle, we stay

01:53:00.190 --> 01:53:02.859
and actually make it out of here?

01:53:03.735 --> 01:53:07.363
Someday we might look back on this
and decide that

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:10.867
saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

01:53:10.951 --> 01:53:13.870
we were able to pull out of this whole

01:53:13.954 --> 01:53:16.080
God-awful, shitty mess.

01:53:17.749 --> 01:53:20.251
That's what l was thinking, sir.

01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:23.588
Like you said, Captain,

01:53:25.382 --> 01:53:27.091
we do that,

01:53:27.551 --> 01:53:30.386
we all earn the right to go home.

01:53:33.223 --> 01:53:34.765
Oh, brother.

01:53:38.228 --> 01:53:40.563
This is everything.

01:53:41.273 --> 01:53:46.903
You got the two 30-calibre machine
guns, 1 7 grenades, 1 1 Hawkins mines.

01:53:47.654 --> 01:53:50.990
You got the two bazookas,
but they only got eight rounds left,

01:53:51.074 --> 01:53:53.284
and assorted small arms.

01:53:53.410 --> 01:53:56.871
We had a 60 mortar
but an arty round took it out.

01:53:56.955 --> 01:53:59.624
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

01:53:59.750 --> 01:54:02.960
-Which they're sure to do.
-What are you thinking, sir?

01:54:03.086 --> 01:54:07.673
Well, l'm thinking they're going to try
to whip around the flanks.

01:54:12.262 --> 01:54:14.513
Unless we can draw
them up this main road here

01:54:14.598 --> 01:54:15.723
in between these buildings

01:54:15.807 --> 01:54:19.769
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

01:54:19.853 --> 01:54:21.896
-Disable 'em?
-lf we can.

01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:23.564
Make that tank a 60-ton roadblock.

01:54:23.649 --> 01:54:25.483
We do that, we got
a fighting chance at their flanks.

01:54:25.609 --> 01:54:27.985
Yes, sir that's good. Split them up.
Don't let them mass anywhere.

01:54:28.111 --> 01:54:31.030
Hit them hard as we can, one-on-one,
and fall back to the bridge.

01:54:31.114 --> 01:54:33.324
Machine gun on the move down here,
and number two up high somewhere

01:54:33.450 --> 01:54:35.451
to piss a little bad news down
on their heads.

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:37.787
That would be the idea.

01:54:38.330 --> 01:54:39.789
Jackson.

01:54:40.457 --> 01:54:42.708
lf we can, l'd like to get you up
in that bell tower.

01:54:42.793 --> 01:54:45.836
-Yes, sir.
-Give you a little company if you need it.

01:54:45.963 --> 01:54:47.964
Yes, sir. Some company couldn't hurt.

01:54:48.048 --> 01:54:52.093
l'd say a .30 with about
1 ,000 rounds would be okay.

01:54:52.177 --> 01:54:54.220
Parker, job opportunity.

01:54:54.304 --> 01:54:56.305
Yeah. Well, it's not the worst idea
ever, Captain.

01:54:56.390 --> 01:54:57.974
lt's just that everything depends
on getting the tank

01:54:58.058 --> 01:55:00.142
down this main road for us
to knock out, right?

01:55:00.310 --> 01:55:03.312
So how the hell do you
plan on doing that?

01:55:03.814 --> 01:55:06.732
Reiben's right. As our esteemed
colleague from the Airborne pointed out,

01:55:06.817 --> 01:55:09.110
what we got here are
a bunch of spit wads,

01:55:09.194 --> 01:55:13.030
so how do we stop the tank
if we get it to commit?

01:55:13.156 --> 01:55:15.533
Give it a rabbit to chase.

01:55:15.659 --> 01:55:18.786
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:20.997
Yeah, but with what?

01:55:22.666 --> 01:55:26.502
-Well, we could try a sticky bomb.
-Sticky bomb, sir?

01:55:27.713 --> 01:55:31.549
-Sir, are you making that up?
-No. lt's in the field manual.

01:55:31.675 --> 01:55:33.509
You check it out if you want to.

01:55:33.593 --> 01:55:35.678
We seem to be out of field manuals, sir.

01:55:35.762 --> 01:55:37.680
Perhaps you can enlighten us?

01:55:37.764 --> 01:55:39.223
All right, you have
some demolition, don't you?

01:55:39.349 --> 01:55:41.267
Some TNT or some composition B?

01:55:41.351 --> 01:55:43.060
Yeah, that, sir, is the one thing
we got plenty of.

01:55:43.186 --> 01:55:45.813
l got that bridge wired with enough
composition B to blow it twice.

01:55:45.897 --> 01:55:47.898
All right. You can spare some, then.

01:55:48.025 --> 01:55:51.235
You take a standard-issue Gl sock,

01:55:51.361 --> 01:55:54.447
cram it with as much
comp B as it can hold,

01:55:54.531 --> 01:55:56.991
rig up a simple fuse,

01:55:57.075 --> 01:55:59.618
then you coat the whole thing
with axle grease.

01:55:59.703 --> 01:56:04.206
That way, when you throw it,
it should stick. lt's a bomb that sticks.

01:56:04.291 --> 01:56:05.916
lt's a sticky bomb.

01:56:06.043 --> 01:56:08.419
You come up with a better way
to knock the tracks off a tank,

01:56:08.545 --> 01:56:10.129
l'm all ears.

01:56:10.213 --> 01:56:13.758
This is good.
Now we got to surrender our socks.

01:56:28.231 --> 01:56:29.732
Haul away.

01:56:43.747 --> 01:56:47.666
All right, select the field of fire.
Crossfire with the one in the bell tower.

01:56:47.751 --> 01:56:51.087
All right, l can cover
1 2 to nine from here.

01:56:54.299 --> 01:56:56.425
-Easy!
-l got her!

01:57:30.794 --> 01:57:32.628
Here are the mines.

01:57:43.557 --> 01:57:45.975
For being the best we can do,

01:57:46.059 --> 01:57:50.062
that forward machine gun
is not in a terrible firing position.

01:57:52.732 --> 01:57:55.234
And this position right here,

01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:58.904
this is the Alamo.

01:57:59.489 --> 01:58:03.159
They push us back this far,
last man alive blows the bridge.

01:58:03.243 --> 01:58:05.286
We only got a 30-second delay
on that fuse,

01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:07.413
so let everyone know that
if you are that last man

01:58:07.497 --> 01:58:11.584
you better hurry your ass off,
or you're not going to be alive long.

01:58:11.668 --> 01:58:15.087
Captain? Where am l during all this?

01:58:16.006 --> 01:58:17.965
Never more than
two feet away from me,

01:58:18.049 --> 01:58:20.259
and that's not negotiable.

01:58:21.386 --> 01:58:23.846
l'll get some ammo. Come on.

01:58:26.850 --> 01:58:28.142
-Hey, Upham.
-Yes.

01:58:28.226 --> 01:58:30.102
-Listen to me, all right?
-Yeah.

01:58:30.187 --> 01:58:31.729
-You're listening?
-Yes.

01:58:31.855 --> 01:58:33.898
All right, we're gonna be displacing

01:58:34.024 --> 01:58:35.608
and falling back like crazy
sons of bitches.

01:58:35.692 --> 01:58:36.775
Right up there.

01:58:36.860 --> 01:58:40.321
So you got to be Johnny on the spot
with the ammo, or we're dead.

01:58:40.405 --> 01:58:42.114
-Right.
-You understand that?

01:58:42.199 --> 01:58:44.492
-Johnny on the spot.
-Yeah.

01:58:44.576 --> 01:58:47.703
-You all right?
-Yeah. Yes.

01:58:48.038 --> 01:58:49.288
You know, when we were
shipping out of England

01:58:49.372 --> 01:58:51.332
the supply sergeant was handing
out cartons of cigarettes,

01:58:51.416 --> 01:58:54.543
and l said "No, thank you,
l don't smoke."

01:58:55.545 --> 01:58:57.129
"l don't smoke."

01:58:58.965 --> 01:59:01.926
-Quite a situation, huh?
-Unbelievable.

01:59:03.261 --> 01:59:08.807
Here. Fucked up beyond
all recognition, right?

01:59:09.267 --> 01:59:11.143
You got that right.

01:59:13.396 --> 01:59:14.772
FUBAR.

01:59:17.108 --> 01:59:18.150
Ouch.

01:59:18.443 --> 01:59:20.069
-Yeah, well...
-FUBAR.

01:59:20.153 --> 01:59:22.655
lt's going to be a real show, huh?

01:59:22.739 --> 01:59:24.657
Yeah. Okay.

01:59:30.914 --> 01:59:32.581
Take it easy.

01:59:33.750 --> 01:59:35.209
FUBAR.

02:00:13.123 --> 02:00:17.459
-Who's that singing, sir?
-Edith Piaf.

02:00:19.879 --> 02:00:22.423
What's she so upset about?

02:00:23.258 --> 02:00:24.800
Her lover left her,

02:00:24.926 --> 02:00:28.387
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes.

02:00:29.556 --> 02:00:31.473
That would do it.

02:01:00.754 --> 02:01:03.714
"Even life itself only represents you.

02:01:06.843 --> 02:01:09.428
"Sometimes l dream
that l'm in your arms."

02:01:09.512 --> 02:01:11.930
What was that part?
She sang that before.

02:01:12.015 --> 02:01:14.391
-The chorus. lt's the chorus.
-The chorus.

02:01:15.143 --> 02:01:17.770
"And you speak softly in my ear

02:01:19.648 --> 02:01:22.066
"and you say things

02:01:22.150 --> 02:01:24.568
"that make my eyes close.

02:01:26.905 --> 02:01:28.989
"And l find that marvellous."

02:01:29.074 --> 02:01:31.700
-Again, Upham...
-Yes.

02:01:32.410 --> 02:01:37.039
...to be honest with you,
l find myself curiously aroused by you.

02:01:37.916 --> 02:01:41.418
-Marvellous.
-No, it's really a melancholy song.

02:01:41.544 --> 02:01:45.214
At the beginning of the song, she says,
"And then one day, you left.

02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:49.343
"You left me, and l've been
desperate ever since.

02:01:49.427 --> 02:01:52.596
"l see you all over the sky,
l see you all over the Earth."

02:01:52.722 --> 02:01:54.348
Jesus, Upham,
any more songs like this,

02:01:54.432 --> 02:01:56.141
the krauts aren't going
to have to shoot me.

02:01:56.226 --> 02:01:59.061
l'm just going to slit my own wrists.

02:01:59.187 --> 02:02:01.855
You know,
you're a strange bird, Upham.

02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:03.816
Sorry, it's Edith, you know.

02:02:03.900 --> 02:02:05.901
You know what
that song reminds me of?

02:02:06.027 --> 02:02:08.696
lt reminds me of Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
and what she said to me

02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:10.280
the day l left for basic.

02:02:10.407 --> 02:02:12.908
What, "Don't touch me"?

02:02:13.034 --> 02:02:15.577
No. Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
is our super's wife.

02:02:15.704 --> 02:02:18.497
She comes into my mom's shop
to try on a few things, all right?

02:02:18.581 --> 02:02:22.376
And she's easily, like, a 44 double E.

02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:24.086
-Double E?
-These things are massive.

02:02:24.212 --> 02:02:25.421
Those are big.

02:02:25.547 --> 02:02:28.882
No. And l've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42 D, all right?

02:02:28.967 --> 02:02:30.676
So we're in the dressing room,
she's trying to squeeze

02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:34.263
into this side-cut,
silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle

02:02:34.389 --> 02:02:36.557
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

02:02:36.641 --> 02:02:39.226
And it's beautiful 'cause she's just
pouring out of this thing, you know?

02:02:39.310 --> 02:02:41.061
-ls it really tight?
-No, no. lt's beautiful.

02:02:41.146 --> 02:02:42.604
And she sees me, and she can tell

02:02:42.731 --> 02:02:45.315
l got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty, all right?

02:02:45.442 --> 02:02:47.443
And she says to me,
"Richard, calm down."

02:02:47.569 --> 02:02:50.028
And she says, "When you're over there,

02:02:50.113 --> 02:02:51.989
"if you see anything that upsets you,

02:02:52.115 --> 02:02:55.159
"or if you're ever scared,
l want you to close your eyes

02:02:55.285 --> 02:02:58.287
"and think of these. You understand?"

02:02:59.789 --> 02:03:01.915
So l said, "Yes, ma'am."

02:03:15.096 --> 02:03:17.139
Are you all right, sir?

02:03:18.141 --> 02:03:20.934
Yeah, l'm just keeping the rhythm.

02:03:25.815 --> 02:03:28.776
ls it true you were
a teacher back home?

02:03:29.819 --> 02:03:31.278
Yes.

02:03:31.362 --> 02:03:33.697
See, that's something l could never do,
you know.

02:03:33.823 --> 02:03:38.285
Not after the way me and my brothers
treated our teachers. No, sir.

02:03:40.622 --> 02:03:43.040
l had 1 ,000 kids like you.

02:03:49.297 --> 02:03:52.007
l can't see my brothers' faces.

02:03:53.343 --> 02:03:56.011
l've been trying,
and l can't see their faces at all.

02:03:56.137 --> 02:03:58.305
Has that ever happened to you?

02:03:58.389 --> 02:04:00.808
You gotta think of a context.

02:04:03.019 --> 02:04:05.103
What does that mean?

02:04:05.188 --> 02:04:06.730
Well, you don't just think
about their faces.

02:04:06.856 --> 02:04:11.485
You think about something specific,
something you've done together.

02:04:15.198 --> 02:04:18.158
Well, when l think of home,
l think of something specific.

02:04:18.243 --> 02:04:21.370
l think of my hammock in the backyard,

02:04:22.205 --> 02:04:26.542
or my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

02:04:30.839 --> 02:04:34.132
This one night, two of my brothers came

02:04:34.217 --> 02:04:37.219
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

02:04:38.054 --> 02:04:41.098
and they said
they had a surprise for me.

02:04:41.683 --> 02:04:44.810
So they took me to the barn,
up into the loft,

02:04:44.894 --> 02:04:47.896
and there was my oldest brother Dan

02:04:49.023 --> 02:04:52.067
with Alice. Alice Jardine.

02:04:55.071 --> 02:04:59.241
l mean, picture a girl who just took
a nosedive from the ugly tree

02:04:59.367 --> 02:05:01.952
and hit every branch coming down.

02:05:03.913 --> 02:05:06.540
And Dan's got her shirt off.

02:05:06.624 --> 02:05:09.418
So he's working on this bra
and he's trying to get it off

02:05:09.544 --> 02:05:12.754
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out,

02:05:13.590 --> 02:05:16.925
"Danny, you're a young man!
Don't do it!"

02:05:19.596 --> 02:05:23.098
And so Alice Jardine hears this
and she screams, and she jumps up,

02:05:23.224 --> 02:05:24.850
and she tries to get
running out of the barn,

02:05:24.934 --> 02:05:26.143
but she's still got this shirt
over her head.

02:05:26.269 --> 02:05:30.439
She goes running right into the wall
and knocks herself out.

02:05:30.565 --> 02:05:34.735
So now Dan is just so mad at us,
he starts coming after us,

02:05:34.819 --> 02:05:37.195
but at the same time,
Alice is over there unconscious.

02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:38.780
He's got to wake her up.

02:05:38.907 --> 02:05:42.159
So he grabs her by a leg
and he's dragging her.

02:05:42.285 --> 02:05:45.454
At the same time, he picks up a shovel
and he's going after Sean.

02:05:45.580 --> 02:05:47.706
And Sean said,
"What are you trying to hit me for?

02:05:47.790 --> 02:05:49.917
"l just did you a favour."

02:05:51.753 --> 02:05:53.629
And so this makes Dan more angry.

02:05:53.755 --> 02:05:56.673
He tries to swing this thing.
He loses the shovel.

02:05:56.799 --> 02:05:59.468
lt goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

02:05:59.594 --> 02:06:02.179
The thing explodes,
the whole barn almost goes up

02:06:02.305 --> 02:06:04.473
because of this thing.

02:06:19.322 --> 02:06:21.198
That was it. That was the last...
That was...

02:06:21.324 --> 02:06:22.866
Dan went off to basic next day.

02:06:22.992 --> 02:06:26.578
That was the last night
the four of us were together.

02:06:26.663 --> 02:06:28.789
That was two years ago.

02:06:30.667 --> 02:06:32.042
Oh, my.

02:06:34.003 --> 02:06:37.547
Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.

02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:40.175
No.

02:06:41.344 --> 02:06:44.054
No. That one l save just for me.

02:07:49.370 --> 02:07:51.246
Enemy from the east.

02:07:52.415 --> 02:07:55.333
He sees Tiger tanks, two of them.

02:07:55.418 --> 02:07:57.419
Panzer tanks, two of them.

02:07:57.545 --> 02:07:59.337
lnfantry.

02:07:59.422 --> 02:08:01.298
Fifty plus change.

02:08:10.266 --> 02:08:12.017
Disperse! You know what to do!

02:08:12.101 --> 02:08:13.643
-Reiben, get on the rabbit.
-Yes, sir.

02:08:13.770 --> 02:08:17.105
-Upham, get some cover.
-Mellish and Henderson, lock and load!

02:08:17.231 --> 02:08:20.150
-This is it.
-Everybody check your ammo!

02:08:20.818 --> 02:08:22.110
Good luck, Reiben.

02:08:22.236 --> 02:08:25.572
l don't need any luck, Sarge,
l was born lucky.

02:08:38.336 --> 02:08:39.628
One in five tracer?

02:08:39.712 --> 02:08:41.713
Yep, and tracers point both ways.

02:08:41.798 --> 02:08:45.842
Yeah? Why don't you check
the head space and she should run.

02:08:53.684 --> 02:08:55.894
Upham! Hustle up!

02:09:46.237 --> 02:09:47.904
-Corporal Upham?
-Yes, sir.

02:09:48.030 --> 02:09:50.282
We don't have a 30-calibre
machine gun in this position.

02:09:50.366 --> 02:09:53.743
Either Mr Mellish or Mr Jackson
in the bell tower needs that.

02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:55.203
Yes, sir.

02:09:56.038 --> 02:09:59.291
Upham! Jackson's fine.
Turn around to Mellish.

02:10:20.730 --> 02:10:25.692
There's a ton of infantry, Captain.
l don't know if they took the bait though.

02:10:48.466 --> 02:10:50.592
You got any more of that?

02:11:36.764 --> 02:11:39.099
Panzers didn't take the bait.

02:11:44.021 --> 02:11:46.856
lnfantry's moving to the left.

02:11:46.941 --> 02:11:50.318
Halftrack just went by
with about 20 troops, sir.

02:13:29.001 --> 02:13:32.337
Mellish! Henderson! Displace!

02:13:53.901 --> 02:13:55.693
Do it, now! Light it up!

02:13:55.778 --> 02:13:57.570
You! Light it!

02:14:08.749 --> 02:14:10.875
Thirty infantry on the right flank!

02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:13.461
Get over there,
find a hole, and stop them!

02:14:13.546 --> 02:14:15.213
Displace!

02:14:26.809 --> 02:14:28.101
Upham!

02:14:43.492 --> 02:14:44.951
Clear!

02:14:46.745 --> 02:14:47.996
Krauts!

02:14:49.999 --> 02:14:51.499
Right flank!

02:15:27.953 --> 02:15:30.121
Get down! Get down!

02:15:37.171 --> 02:15:40.298
Upham! Upham! 30-cal! Hurry!

02:15:40.382 --> 02:15:43.885
And find the captain!
This flank's going to fold!

02:16:38.773 --> 02:16:41.567
Reversing! He's still in this fight!

02:16:42.570 --> 02:16:45.112
No, no, Ryan, get down! Get down!

02:16:58.043 --> 02:17:19.897
Ryan!

02:17:22.234 --> 02:17:23.817
-Ryan!
-Get off me!

02:17:23.943 --> 02:17:26.404
-Are you all right?
-Get off me!

02:17:26.487 --> 02:17:28.656
Yeah, yeah,
l'm fine, too, Captain. Thanks.

02:17:29.491 --> 02:17:34.162
Okay, both sides!
Get aboard! Get a grenade in there!

02:17:37.124 --> 02:17:38.625
Grenade!

02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:42.128
20-mill!

02:17:43.589 --> 02:17:46.299
Flak gun, 20 millimetre. Take it out!

02:17:58.646 --> 02:18:02.190
Heavy weapon in defilade below!
l ain't got a shot!

02:18:06.695 --> 02:18:08.404
Pincer move, Parker!

02:18:08.530 --> 02:18:10.990
-Targets 8 o'clock low!
-Shit!

02:18:11.075 --> 02:18:13.325
God grant me strength.

02:18:27.216 --> 02:18:28.758
Displace!

02:18:28.884 --> 02:18:30.259
Come on!

02:18:46.067 --> 02:18:48.820
Cover, Upham! Cover! Cover!

02:19:05.587 --> 02:19:07.588
l'm out of 30-calibre.

02:19:10.968 --> 02:19:13.844
Blessed be the Lord, my strength,
which teaches my hands to war

02:19:13.929 --> 02:19:16.263
and my fingers to fight.

02:19:24.772 --> 02:19:27.275
My goodness and my fortress,

02:19:27.359 --> 02:19:30.027
my high tower and my deliverer,

02:19:32.614 --> 02:19:35.825
my shield and he in whom l trust.

02:19:38.870 --> 02:19:40.955
Come here, baby.

02:20:03.562 --> 02:20:05.354
Parker, get down!

02:20:27.044 --> 02:20:29.462
Captain, that 20-millimetre's killing us.

02:20:29.546 --> 02:20:31.839
We gotta try to flank it somehow.

02:20:31.965 --> 02:20:34.842
Well, let me get over for the top shot.

02:20:59.326 --> 02:21:00.743
Upham!

02:21:19.596 --> 02:21:24.058
Upham! Upham!
Upham, ammo, God damn it!

02:22:07.269 --> 02:22:09.687
l'm jammed! l'm jammed!
You got any 30-cal?

02:22:09.771 --> 02:22:11.439
-l'm out.
-Shit.

02:22:23.285 --> 02:22:25.786
Upham! Upham!

02:23:23.929 --> 02:23:25.388
Reiben!

02:23:51.873 --> 02:23:56.043
l'm out! l need another bandoleer!
Anybody got a bandoleer?

02:24:21.069 --> 02:24:23.237
God! God!

02:24:27.534 --> 02:24:30.453
You stupid son of a bitch!

02:25:14.122 --> 02:25:16.665
Let's stop. Let's stop. Let's stop.
Listen to me! Listen to me! Stop!

02:25:16.750 --> 02:25:18.501
Stop! Don't...

02:25:55.539 --> 02:26:00.376
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

02:26:00.460 --> 02:26:02.253
Son of a bitch!

02:26:03.713 --> 02:26:04.755
Bitch!

02:27:23.793 --> 02:27:26.921
-l'm out.
-Those 60 rounds.

02:27:28.298 --> 02:27:31.467
-We can use them without the tube.
-How?

02:27:31.551 --> 02:27:34.511
Fuse-arming wire, set back, heave it!

02:27:50.237 --> 02:27:51.904
Panzerschreck!

02:28:25.981 --> 02:28:28.190
We're going to the Alamo.

02:28:38.451 --> 02:28:40.286
Alamo! Alamo!

02:28:59.848 --> 02:29:02.141
We'll take it! You fall back!

02:29:02.225 --> 02:29:05.853
-You be right behind us!
-Soon as we're in business!

02:29:09.816 --> 02:29:11.900
Displace. Reiben.

02:29:14.404 --> 02:29:15.863
Reload.

02:30:04.662 --> 02:30:06.205
All right, go.

02:30:07.457 --> 02:30:08.540
We're blowing the bridge!

02:30:08.625 --> 02:30:11.543
-Get off! Clear the bridge!
-Displace...

02:30:34.401 --> 02:30:37.403
Sarge! Mike, are you all right?

02:30:37.487 --> 02:30:40.030
-l just got the wind knocked out of me.
-Well, get out of here!

02:30:40.115 --> 02:30:43.492
Take cover!
We're going to blow this bridge!

02:30:44.953 --> 02:30:46.703
Come on, come on!

02:30:51.501 --> 02:30:54.336
Tiger coming!
Coming across the bridge!

02:31:26.411 --> 02:31:29.705
Captain, get behind something!

02:31:29.789 --> 02:31:32.458
Come on, Captain, move it!

02:31:55.398 --> 02:31:56.607
Mike.

02:32:01.821 --> 02:32:03.155
Mike!

02:32:42.153 --> 02:32:43.445
Captain.

02:32:46.241 --> 02:32:50.327
Captain, where the hell are you going?
Captain, get back here!

02:34:43.399 --> 02:34:44.733
Upham.

02:35:15.723 --> 02:35:17.933
Hang in there, Captain.

02:36:02.061 --> 02:36:03.770

02:36:06.566 --> 02:36:09.109
Medic! We got a medic?

They're tank-busters, sir. P-51 s.

02:36:19.746 --> 02:36:21.955
Angels on our shoulders.

02:36:27.920 --> 02:36:29.629
What, sir?

02:36:34.093 --> 02:36:35.469

Earn this.

02:36:43.019 --> 02:36:44.478
Earn it.

02:37:13.925 --> 02:37:16.092
"My dear Mrs Ryan,

"can compensate you

My family is with me today.

They wanted to come with me.

02:39:50.456 --> 02:39:51.581
To be honest with you,

02:39:51.666 --> 02:39:54.960
l wasn't sure how l'd feel
coming back here.

02:39:58.339 --> 02:40:01.758
Every day l think about
what you said to me

02:40:01.842 --> 02:40:03.969
that day on the bridge.

02:40:05.846 --> 02:40:09.307
And l've tried to live my life
the best l could.

02:40:10.393 --> 02:40:12.811
l hope that was enough.

02:40:13.562 --> 02:40:16.314
l hope that, at least in your eyes,

02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:21.861
l've earned what all of you
have done for me.

02:40:35.376 --> 02:40:36.710
James.

02:40:39.005 --> 02:40:41.006
"Captain John H Miller."

02:40:49.682 --> 02:40:53.560
-Tell me l've led a good life.
-What?

02:40:54.854 --> 02:40:57.022
Tell me l'm a good man.

02:41:04.238 --> 02:49:05.218
You are.
