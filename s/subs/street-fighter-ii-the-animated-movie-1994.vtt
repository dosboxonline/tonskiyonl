05:20.112 --> 05:20.987
Minister!

05:21.655 --> 05:23.823
A word, please, Minister!

05:25.826 --> 05:26.742
Look this way, please!

05:27.536 --> 05:29.036
- Thatˊs another story.
- Right.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.455
Can we get an interview, please?

05:37.045 --> 05:37.962
Minister, a word, please!

05:40.424 --> 05:41.299
Whatˊs that?!

05:49.599 --> 05:50.599
Youˊre Minister of Justice
Sellers, correct?

06:00.902 --> 06:02.236
- Go after her!
- Oh my God!

06:05.073 --> 06:06.240
Stop her!

06:07.617 --> 06:08.492
Get off of me!

06:09.745 --> 06:10.328
GET OFF OF ME!

06:16.668 --> 06:18.627
The terroristˊs name is Cammy White.

06:19.504 --> 06:22.840
A special agent who belongs to MI6.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.843
Sheˊs being interrogated at B Base...

06:26.553 --> 06:29.055
but she has no memory
of the past 3 years.

06:30.098 --> 06:30.973
What do you mean?

06:31.808 --> 06:33.893
It seems like her mind is
being controlled.

06:34.519 --> 06:36.437
By using Cammyˊs analysis data,

06:36.605 --> 06:40.858
we should be able to figure out...

06:41.276 --> 06:42.860
how Shadowlaw is creating terrorists
with special abilities.

06:44.613 --> 06:47.323
We also know that Shadowlaw is
gathering info...

06:47.491 --> 06:52.453
on street fighters around the world
to create weapons like Cammy.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.289
Turning street fighters into
terrorists, huh...

06:56.249 --> 06:58.876
This man is a fighter named Sagat.

06:59.211 --> 07:02.755
He is admired as a muay thai champion
and a hero in Thailand.

07:03.924 --> 07:08.677
This is Bison, exiled from the boxing
world due to his savagery.

07:10.514 --> 07:15.059
This is Balrog, a Spanish fighter
feared as Crazy Viper.

07:16.186 --> 07:19.271
These three are now
members of Shadowlaw...

07:19.648 --> 07:21.816
as combat personnel under Vega.

07:25.904 --> 07:29.490
Shadowlawˊs crimes are increasing
in size year by year.

07:30.075 --> 07:32.076
We need to destroy them immediately.

07:32.994 --> 07:36.080
I think itˊs time we carry out an
investigation with the US military.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.504
Patterson Air Force Base

08:00.397 --> 08:01.605
Major Guile!

08:02.190 --> 08:04.442
People from Interpol
are here to see you.

08:05.694 --> 08:06.694
Interpol?

08:15.036 --> 08:15.744
Iˊm Chun-Li.

08:16.788 --> 08:17.455
What do you want?

08:18.915 --> 08:22.334
Weˊve come to have a meeting on
joint investigation on Shadowlaw.

08:23.378 --> 08:24.545
Iˊll defeat Vega.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.465
What do you mean?

08:29.301 --> 08:31.427
I donˊt need help
defeating Vega.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.554
Major Guile, this is a decision
made by the military!

08:37.392 --> 08:39.894
We just need to defeat Vega, right?
Well, good luck to you, too.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.853
- Iˊve been waiting for you.
- Hurry up and show me.

11:28.647 --> 11:29.647
Right away, sir.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.818
This is the newly revamped
monitor cyborg with...

11:35.028 --> 11:37.946
super performance computer equipped.

11:42.369 --> 11:46.413
Images captured by this monitor
cyborg will be sent instantly to...

11:47.248 --> 11:50.626
the super computer at headquarters
via satellite communication.

11:52.337 --> 11:57.966
Itˊs already been arranged to replace
the old monitor robots with these.

11:58.843 --> 11:59.593
Good.

12:05.684 --> 12:08.519
By the way, have you found him?

12:09.187 --> 12:10.312
Not yet, sir.

12:10.980 --> 12:15.192
How can you not find a man
so strong he defeated Sagat?

12:15.985 --> 12:19.405
Weˊve been tracking info
on fighters from all over...

12:20.573 --> 12:22.449
I wonder if this man named Ryu really
can be such a strong fighter.

12:22.701 --> 12:27.162
This was recorded by the computer.

12:27.789 --> 12:33.168
2000 is the limit of any fighterˊs
potential combat capacity.

12:33.670 --> 12:37.005
But 3600? I can hardly believe it.

12:37.674 --> 12:41.135
At any rate, youˊll have to find
Ryu as soon as possible!

12:41.386 --> 12:44.012
I donˊt care if itˊs on top of
the Himalayas. Send cyborgs out!

14:06.596 --> 14:11.517
Ryu, what do you see lying
ahead of your fists?

14:50.306 --> 14:52.307
Thatˊs good for now.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.226
Get some rest.

14:56.771 --> 15:00.524
Before breakfast, letˊs go to
the valley to get some water.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.358
OK!

15:05.029 --> 15:08.991
You bastard! Why did you pull your
punches?! Did you go easy on me?

15:10.952 --> 15:13.328
Idiot! I donˊt go easy on you!

15:13.997 --> 15:16.832
Iˊll never understand you.

15:21.588 --> 15:22.629
Thatˊs fine.

15:22.839 --> 15:27.050
Someday, thereˊll be time when we
seriously have to fight each other.

15:53.369 --> 15:56.246
Seattle

16:30.406 --> 16:31.573
Sorry that Iˊm late.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.578
Itˊs not usual for you
to be late, Ken.

16:37.413 --> 16:41.625
My opponent was harder I expected,
and it took longer than I thought.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.086
And how did it go?

16:44.754 --> 16:45.629
Of course I won.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.425
So you added another title
to your name.

16:51.803 --> 16:52.761
Yeah.

16:53.596 --> 16:56.431
Suzhou, China

16:57.600 --> 16:59.393
Hey, is Fei Long not here yet?

17:00.228 --> 17:02.646
We canˊt shoot a movie without
the leading man.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.773
Strange.
He shouldˊve headed here already.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.361
This happens every time.
Give me a break...

17:15.785 --> 17:18.203
- Hey, Fei Long.
- Whatˊs going on?

17:18.788 --> 17:20.454
Just some entertainment.

17:21.249 --> 17:21.915
Entertainment?

17:22.625 --> 17:27.003
Some young man in the audience
is being dragged to the ring.

17:27.630 --> 17:28.964
I didnˊt say anything!

17:29.382 --> 17:33.135
I heard you muttering to yourself
while watching the show.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.554
You must be pretty tough,
talking like that.

17:38.516 --> 17:39.516
Hm, interesting.

17:39.726 --> 17:44.021
Such a big star, yet you still like
to fight in places like this.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.398
That guy doesnˊt look so bad.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.109
Little brat...

18:07.003 --> 18:08.670
Nice one.

18:12.383 --> 18:14.593
Can I challenge you now?

18:21.726 --> 18:25.103
You look like some fighter.
Whatˊs your name?

18:25.813 --> 18:27.272
My name is Ryu.

18:27.774 --> 18:31.443
Iˊm just a Japanese traveler.
I have no intention to fight.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.236
Not yet! Itˊs not over yet!

19:56.863 --> 19:58.655
Iˊll show you my special!

19:59.782 --> 20:00.907
Get ready!

20:28.477 --> 20:30.979
- I canˊt believee this!
- Did he just get beaten?

20:49.665 --> 20:52.334
Now I remember! Ryu!

20:53.461 --> 20:57.255
A few years ago, there was a fighter
who defeated...

20:57.882 --> 20:59.966
the muay thai champion,
Sagat, and went missing.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.678
I think he was Japanese and
the name was Ryu.

21:04.305 --> 21:05.639
Are you that Ryu?

21:07.308 --> 21:11.436
I heard Sagat is now in Shadowlaw
training himself.

21:12.480 --> 21:14.397
Shadowlaw? Whatˊs that?

21:15.066 --> 21:16.733
- You donˊt know?
- No.

21:17.652 --> 21:20.487
Itˊs a crime syndicate
thatˊs spreading...

21:21.030 --> 21:22.322
weaponry and drugs
all over the world.

21:23.616 --> 21:27.410
Sagat...is in a crime syndicate...

21:53.521 --> 21:55.981
Ryu...weˊll meet again.

22:06.534 --> 22:10.370
Northern Seattle

22:39.608 --> 22:40.567
Fight, Ken!

22:41.485 --> 22:43.528
Iˊve come here to fight you!

22:48.784 --> 22:52.871
You donˊt get it, do you?
I donˊt street fight anymore!

22:53.706 --> 22:56.708
It doesnˊt matter
where a fighter fights.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.626
Nonsense.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.887
Whatˊs the point in fighting
on the street like this?

23:09.388 --> 23:12.849
You have honorable titles
as a fighter.

23:13.142 --> 23:16.686
Defeating such a man is
an honor to another fighter!

23:17.897 --> 23:19.564
Thatˊs what I call nonsense!

23:20.483 --> 23:22.525
Plus, you canˊt defeat me.

23:23.152 --> 23:26.154
No matter who comes at me,
no one can defeat me...

23:27.156 --> 23:28.281
except for Ryu.

23:28.991 --> 23:32.744
Ryu? That vagabond fighter
that went missing?

23:34.038 --> 23:36.498
Donˊt compare me with
someone like him!

23:47.426 --> 23:50.011
I see. I guess youˊre not that bad.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.013
I like it!

24:24.964 --> 24:25.839
Whatˊs wrong?

24:26.966 --> 24:30.260
Why do you not finish me?

24:48.446 --> 24:51.322
Ryu, where are you?

24:52.032 --> 24:53.408
Come settle the fight soon!

25:02.751 --> 25:06.129
Calcutta

26:48.399 --> 26:49.399
Are you all right?

27:00.828 --> 27:01.828
Oh no...

27:12.047 --> 27:14.424
I see. Your motherˊs ill.

27:25.352 --> 27:28.229
Iˊm sorry.
Can you buy it again with this?

27:29.064 --> 27:29.772
Here.

28:43.013 --> 28:44.514
Damn you...!

29:32.479 --> 29:33.938
Whatˊs this...?

29:35.441 --> 29:37.483
My body wonˊt...move...

29:52.249 --> 29:53.416
I feel a powerful aura.

29:56.128 --> 29:56.919
Heˊs strong.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.719
- Come on!
- Whatˊs going on?!

30:05.763 --> 30:08.598
- Fight!
- Hurry up and fight!

30:13.937 --> 30:15.646
- Dhalsim!
- Fight!

30:21.361 --> 30:22.111
Wait!

30:24.072 --> 30:26.199
Iˊll let you win this fight.

30:26.867 --> 30:29.202
What do you mean,
ˊˊlet me winˊˊ?!

30:30.829 --> 30:33.289
I felt someone powerful
behind me.

30:34.124 --> 30:38.002
Are you going to forfeit the match
with that nonsense?!

30:38.629 --> 30:41.964
No. I concede the fight.

30:47.054 --> 30:49.180
Then Iˊll take the prize.

30:49.848 --> 30:50.807
Yeah.

30:51.433 --> 30:53.059
Whatˊs wrong?!

30:53.268 --> 30:55.895
Iˊve never felt such strong
fighting power before.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.483
- Whatˊs going on?
- He stopped fighting?

32:12.931 --> 32:13.431
Damn it!

32:20.397 --> 32:21.606
Are you all right?!

32:25.110 --> 32:28.070
- Who are those guys?
- Terrorists from Shadowlaw.

32:28.822 --> 32:29.822
Shadowlaw?

32:33.410 --> 32:38.039
- Leftover money...
- Yeah, I got it. Thank you.

32:52.429 --> 32:54.722
Yo! Half of this money is yours.

32:55.599 --> 33:00.311
- Money?
- I mightˊve lost without you.

33:01.480 --> 33:04.148
Take it.
Weˊre both Japanese.

33:05.275 --> 33:06.442
Donˊt be humble!

33:11.865 --> 33:14.825
Are you sure you erased Jahan?

33:15.285 --> 33:17.244
Yes, I am sure.

33:17.496 --> 33:22.333
At the scene, the monitor cyborg
found an unknown fighter.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.460
- Weˊre investigating him now.
- Anything else?

33:25.337 --> 33:29.298
The cyborg in Seattle sent us
some interesting data.

33:29.466 --> 33:31.968
Iˊd like you to see it as well.

33:32.636 --> 33:33.719
Iˊll be right there.

33:51.321 --> 33:55.950
I hope your info was worth
my trip here.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.120
Yes. Take a look at this.

34:03.208 --> 34:07.837
This man has some skill,
but we found something intriguing.

34:09.672 --> 34:12.967
I compared him against Ryuˊs image.

34:13.802 --> 34:14.719
Whoˊs this guy?

34:15.262 --> 34:16.262
Ken Masters.

34:16.804 --> 34:21.141
The command center pc has data
of his title matches.

34:21.685 --> 34:24.228
But we didnˊt realize his relation
to Ryu.

34:24.521 --> 34:25.603
What do you mean?

34:26.440 --> 34:30.400
Ken and Ryu trained under the same
master for over 10 years in Japan.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.904
Their fighting skills
are roughly equal.

34:34.156 --> 34:38.409
Equal? The potential fighting
capacity is different.

34:39.286 --> 34:43.914
We havenˊt acquired current data
on Ryu, but possibly...

34:44.458 --> 34:47.752
a bug in the system or Ryu hasnˊt...

34:48.295 --> 34:51.255
been able to utilize his capacity.

34:52.674 --> 34:55.592
Ryuˊs fellow pupil...

34:56.136 --> 35:00.681
It might be interesting
to use him as a weapon...

35:00.891 --> 35:02.767
for Plan P.

35:03.185 --> 35:06.270
General, American President
Ed Pressman is...

35:06.480 --> 35:09.815
a strong promoter of
arms control legislation...

35:10.317 --> 35:12.151
so heˊs heavily guarded.

35:16.031 --> 35:20.409
We need him out of the way,
but it must be done carefully.

35:21.244 --> 35:25.289
If we train him with my Psycho Power,
itˊll work out.

35:25.999 --> 35:28.292
But...the Cammy incident...

35:29.044 --> 35:31.295
Cammy achieved our objective.

35:32.255 --> 35:34.673
Sheˊs being interrogated
at Interpol.

35:34.883 --> 35:38.636
I donˊt care. Her job is done.
Leave her be.

35:40.013 --> 35:44.975
Weˊve received interrogation footage
of Cammy at Interpol.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.479
Let me see it.

35:54.945 --> 35:59.031
We know that youˊre an MI6 agent.

35:59.908 --> 36:00.908
I donˊt remember.

36:01.618 --> 36:05.329
We donˊt know why an MI6 agent
such as yourself...

36:05.622 --> 36:07.206
assassinated the Minister
of Justice...

36:07.833 --> 36:09.542
by the command of Shadowlaw.

36:10.544 --> 36:11.585
I donˊt remember.

36:12.129 --> 36:15.422
Cammy, your mind
was being controlled.

36:15.966 --> 36:19.301
Weˊd like to at least
get a clue...

36:19.469 --> 36:21.095
as to how and where
you were controlled.

36:21.513 --> 36:22.721
Try to remember.

36:23.890 --> 36:24.890
I donˊt remember.

36:26.935 --> 36:28.018
Leave her be.

36:28.228 --> 36:32.815
Some measly Interpol system is
no match for my Psycho Power.

36:33.567 --> 36:36.443
But if we leave her be...

36:36.736 --> 36:38.279
Weˊll take care of her in time.

36:38.905 --> 36:41.907
More importantly, do not slack
on finding Ryu.

36:42.117 --> 36:45.786
No matter what,
bring him to me.

36:46.121 --> 36:47.204
Understood, sir.

36:47.831 --> 36:51.750
On another note, would you like to
order the capture of Ken?

36:54.129 --> 36:55.462
No need.

36:55.672 --> 36:59.800
Itˊs fun to trap a man like that.

37:26.536 --> 37:27.578
Whatˊs all this?

37:28.121 --> 37:30.956
Investigating on your own
is against the rules.

37:32.500 --> 37:33.834
Youˊre nosy, lady.

37:35.879 --> 37:37.463
If youˊre not gonna move,
Iˊll just run you over.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.424
Go ahead.

37:46.640 --> 37:50.726
Major Guile, Iˊm sorry your best
friend was killed by Vega.

37:54.564 --> 37:58.901
Is it also Interpolˊs job to
pry into the private lives of others?

38:01.613 --> 38:05.866
Iˊm sorry to intrude,
but I read your file.

38:06.826 --> 38:10.454
Vega is no longer just your target
to avenge your best friend.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.916
Standing here talking wonˊt
stop Vega.

38:14.626 --> 38:17.002
Then try me out and see
if Iˊm all talk?

38:17.587 --> 38:19.338
I donˊt have time to play!

38:30.475 --> 38:32.726
Vega is also my target.
To avenge my father...

38:36.022 --> 38:38.148
But...Iˊm an Interpol agent!

38:38.942 --> 38:41.986
Annihilation of Shadowlaw comes
before my private grudges.

38:42.988 --> 38:43.821
Major Guile...

38:44.489 --> 38:46.573
if you have pride
as a member of the Air Force...

38:47.450 --> 38:49.076
lend us your help!

38:57.252 --> 39:00.504
I donˊt like a woman who talks
too much. Are you coming or not?

39:01.589 --> 39:03.340
Of course, Iˊm coming!

39:03.508 --> 39:06.468
Los Angeles

39:38.335 --> 39:40.669
Why is there a monitor cyborg
at a nightclub?

39:41.463 --> 39:44.506
Some fighter named Dee Jay is there.

39:58.688 --> 40:03.233
You idiots donˊt get my music.
Go home.

40:07.947 --> 40:08.614
Bastard...!

40:23.213 --> 40:25.005
I didnˊt do anything!

40:29.511 --> 40:30.511
There!

40:31.471 --> 40:33.055
Iˊm Major Guile, Air Force.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.892
What does Major Guile of
the Air Force want?

40:37.227 --> 40:38.936
Youˊre my fan?

40:39.771 --> 40:41.730
Youˊve been marked by Shadowlaw.

40:43.525 --> 40:47.027
Shadowlaw as in the scary
organization? Oh, the horror!

40:47.612 --> 40:52.032
Iˊm not kidding. Fall in with them,
and you wonˊt be playing anymore.

40:52.992 --> 40:54.284
I was kidding.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.955
Why would Shadowlaw mark
a guy like me?

40:58.790 --> 41:02.251
Theyˊre gathering info on
each and every notable fighter.

41:03.128 --> 41:06.422
- That doesnˊt concern me!
- Yes, it does.

41:07.215 --> 41:09.967
Your data has already been sent
to Shadowlaw by this.

41:14.931 --> 41:18.434
Whatˊs this monster?
Some kind of creepy doll?

41:18.935 --> 41:20.227
Itˊs a monitor cyborg.

41:20.895 --> 41:24.815
It gathers information for
Shadowlawˊs supercomputer.

41:26.943 --> 41:31.321
A lot of these are roaming around.
Watch out, and tell your friends.

41:45.879 --> 41:47.087
Guile, huh...

41:48.798 --> 41:53.760
I see heˊs cooperating with Interpol
to try to stop me.

41:59.476 --> 42:00.684
What do you say, Balrog?

42:01.394 --> 42:03.520
Would you like to have fun...

42:03.730 --> 42:06.231
with this agent, Chun-Li?

42:14.866 --> 42:16.825
Sheˊs beautiful, isnˊt she?

42:26.961 --> 42:30.506
An agent trying to avenge
her father...

42:31.382 --> 42:33.967
Donˊt you think
itˊs admirable, Balrog?

42:37.764 --> 42:39.598
Patch me to Las Vegas.

42:39.807 --> 42:42.684
Las Vegas

42:53.446 --> 42:54.446
Here you are.

43:18.429 --> 43:22.808
Most of the bosses in charge of
their trafficking routes are here.

43:23.226 --> 43:25.102
Itˊll be OK. Right.

43:26.312 --> 43:29.231
Contact the command center?
Understood.

43:36.239 --> 43:39.491
That investigation has been
troublesome lately.

43:39.826 --> 43:41.827
Our upcoming transaction
will go smoothly, right?

43:42.662 --> 43:46.707
Itˊs been taken care of.
5000kg of coke to London, correct?

43:48.209 --> 43:51.712
Could you tell the General
to contact me once?

43:52.046 --> 43:53.046
Will do.

43:53.881 --> 43:56.008
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for waiting.

43:56.634 --> 43:59.511
The show is about to begin.

44:00.138 --> 44:02.598
Please proceed to the hall.

44:05.435 --> 44:07.894
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for waiting.

44:08.688 --> 44:11.732
Let me introduce the fighters
competing today.

44:15.028 --> 44:16.903
Emperor of the Russian
wrestling world...

44:17.238 --> 44:20.365
The man with a steel body...
Zangief!

44:33.713 --> 44:35.088
His opponent is...

44:35.673 --> 44:37.341
a man of unusual origins.

44:37.550 --> 44:41.094
He learned to fight beasts
in the depths of the jungle...

44:41.638 --> 44:42.512
Blanka!

45:45.868 --> 45:46.868
Ouch!

45:58.214 --> 46:01.174
New York

48:12.473 --> 48:13.849
Strange...

48:14.559 --> 48:16.810
She said she was going back
to her room earlier.

49:35.765 --> 49:38.391
Damn it! Iˊm in a hurry...

50:13.636 --> 50:14.928
Youˊre...Balrog!

50:18.808 --> 50:21.226
This is strange.
I have a bad feeling about this.

50:21.978 --> 50:22.852
Pick it up!

51:09.567 --> 51:11.234
Whatˊs that?!
Chun-Li!

51:36.969 --> 51:41.431
Slowly skinning a cornered
rabbit...thatˊs what I like.

51:42.558 --> 51:46.061
This also loves to suck the blood
of especially cute rabbits.

52:20.429 --> 52:23.223
My...my beautiful face...!

52:25.893 --> 52:28.353
Iˊll kill you!

52:38.948 --> 52:40.198
God damn it...

53:59.403 --> 54:08.161
Chun-Li!

54:09.496 --> 54:10.872
Are you OK, Chun-Li?!

54:15.294 --> 54:17.295
- It was Balrog.
- What?!

54:23.552 --> 54:25.470
Chun-Li! Chun-Li!

54:26.680 --> 54:27.555
Chun-Li!

54:29.183 --> 54:30.934
Then what happened to Balrog?

54:32.394 --> 54:33.728
He was handed over to the NYPD?!

54:34.188 --> 54:37.023
Weˊre currently tracking
monitor cyborgs here.

54:37.316 --> 54:40.235
Theyˊve been spotted around
Ken Masters...

54:40.444 --> 54:43.738
winner of the National Fighterˊs
Championship. He lives in Seattle.

54:45.199 --> 54:48.493
Yes. Unlike no-name
street fighters...

54:48.953 --> 54:53.831
heˊs got skills.
Iˊm sure Vega will approach him.

54:55.209 --> 54:59.504
Weˊre also investigating Ryu,
who trained with Ken.

55:00.297 --> 55:03.174
Weˊve heard that a fighter
who headed for Thailand...

55:03.425 --> 55:05.927
from India seems to fit his profile.

55:06.595 --> 55:09.347
OK. You track down that guy,
Ryu, as well.

55:10.683 --> 55:12.809
Iˊm worried about Chun-Li...

55:13.394 --> 55:14.978
Iˊll wait here at the hospital
for a little bit longer.

55:16.230 --> 55:20.233
As soon as things are settled here,
Iˊll go meet Ken in Seattle.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.319
Please have Kenˊs file ready.

55:24.196 --> 55:26.990
Lake Washington

55:48.429 --> 55:49.220
Eliza...

55:50.264 --> 55:51.264
You wanna get married?

55:54.393 --> 55:55.810
What is this all of a sudden?

55:56.478 --> 55:57.270
You donˊt want to?

55:58.188 --> 55:59.772
Thatˊs not what I mean.

56:00.316 --> 56:03.443
Youˊve neveer talked about
anything like this before.

56:04.278 --> 56:05.236
Then why not?

56:05.904 --> 56:06.863
But...

56:07.948 --> 56:08.740
But...?

56:09.533 --> 56:12.035
Itˊs not like you.

56:14.121 --> 56:14.996
Did something happen?

56:15.664 --> 56:16.539
Nothing special...

57:14.848 --> 57:15.473
Ken!

57:22.731 --> 57:26.234
Ken, you ARE acting unusual today.

57:27.444 --> 57:28.194
Sorry.

57:53.554 --> 57:54.554
Thank you.

57:57.307 --> 58:00.435
What you said before...I accept.

58:01.562 --> 58:03.771
- Eliza...
- I love you.

58:12.448 --> 58:13.948
Call me later.

58:40.726 --> 58:44.061
Ryu, Iˊm tired of
waiting for you...

58:51.487 --> 58:53.946
General, the targetˊs
car is in sight.

58:54.239 --> 58:55.573
Good. Move in closer.

59:41.370 --> 59:42.370
Bastard!

59:51.296 --> 59:52.129
What the hell?!

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:04.433
Youˊre Ken Masters, right?

01:00:04.893 --> 01:00:06.519
Iˊve come to pick you up.

01:00:07.229 --> 01:00:09.605
Pick me up?!
Who are you?!

01:00:10.941 --> 01:00:13.651
Iˊm Vega, the General of Shadowlaw.

01:00:14.236 --> 01:00:17.071
Vega? Never heard of you.
What do you want?

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:20.449
Iˊll turn you into a strong fighter.

01:00:20.993 --> 01:00:23.786
Creepy old man. Go away!

01:00:24.496 --> 01:00:28.040
I will turn you into a fighter
stronger than Ryu!

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:31.794
Ryu? You know Ryu?!

01:00:32.462 --> 01:00:35.631
The name Ryu gets you serious, huh?

01:00:36.008 --> 01:00:38.134
Shut up!
Itˊs none of your business!

01:00:53.317 --> 01:00:55.443
You monster!
What are you gonna do with me?!

01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:05.286
Using some weird move...

01:01:06.038 --> 01:01:09.248
No use fighting against
Psycho Power.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.292
Psycho Power?

01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:19.925
Ken, do not resist. Obey me.

01:01:20.469 --> 01:01:21.093
Shut up!

01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:38.444
Ken, obey me.

01:01:43.575 --> 01:01:44.867
Who would obey a monster!

01:01:45.786 --> 01:01:47.453
You donˊt understand, do you?

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:12.770
Youˊre really something.

01:02:13.689 --> 01:02:16.524
Iˊm looking forward to growing you.

01:02:23.115 --> 01:02:27.493
What does it mean for you to come
all the way to see Ken Masters?

01:02:28.704 --> 01:02:30.413
Kenˊs been marked by Vega.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.689
- Is this Kenˊs car?
- Yes, no doubt.

01:02:57.607 --> 01:02:59.191
Weˊre too late.

01:03:01.862 --> 01:03:03.946
New York Branch of Interpol

01:03:05.866 --> 01:03:11.370
Regarding the locations of Shadowlaw
branches and monitor cyborgs...

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:17.001
no bases have been spotted around
Seattle except for warehouses.

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:19.712
If Ken has been taken...

01:03:19.921 --> 01:03:23.466
it would be to where the other
fighters were trained by Vega.

01:03:24.176 --> 01:03:25.426
Do we have any info on such bases?

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:28.429
We havenˊt been able to locate
their training facility yet...

01:03:28.805 --> 01:03:32.433
but their large command center bases
are located in East Asia.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:33.934
Major Guile...

01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:38.105
speaking of East Asia,
we found the location of Ryu...

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.107
Kenˊs fellow pupil.

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:43.194
Thatˊs the man who was
in India. Where is he?

01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:47.823
In the mountains near the Laotian
border, on the Thai side.

01:03:48.492 --> 01:03:51.535
Are there monitor cyborgs
in place around Ryu?

01:03:52.204 --> 01:03:54.622
Yes. Weˊve caught some...

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.043
but Ryu has been moving around
through China, India, Thailand...

01:03:59.878 --> 01:04:02.087
and the objective of
these movements is unknown...

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:05.591
so it doesnˊt look like specific
cyborgs are tracking him.

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:11.847
According to our data, Ryu possesses
the same skill leveel as Ken.

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:14.058
Thereˊs no reason why Vega
would leave him be.

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:20.606
Weˊll approach him first and try to
disrupt his contact with Shadowlaw.

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:27.112
How is the military/Interpol joint
plan to stop Shadowlaw progressing?

01:04:27.697 --> 01:04:31.450
Weˊve already located most of
their large bases.

01:04:31.993 --> 01:04:34.161
We start from East Asia,

01:04:34.663 --> 01:04:37.998
especially the command center
near the Cambodian border...

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:41.669
Weˊve planned a large scale attack
on it by our special forces.

01:05:13.535 --> 01:05:14.493
Chun-Li...

01:05:15.996 --> 01:05:17.955
Weˊve finally located
Vegaˊs main base.

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:22.918
Iˊll avenge you and your
father with my own hands.

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:35.848
You probably want to do it
yourself...

01:05:36.474 --> 01:05:39.018
but this time, let me
handle it while you rest.

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:43.522
Iˊm going now.

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:05.187
Ken...

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:09.733
I see the source of your power
is your rivalry against Ryu.

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:12.027
Very well.

01:07:12.946 --> 01:07:17.825
Let me enhance that rivalry
with my Psycho Power.

01:08:49.501 --> 01:08:50.667
Ryu, are you OK?

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:53.796
Yeah, I am.

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:16.234
Thank you.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:18.444
Another one!

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:04.449
Major Guile.

01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:08.495
Weˊre nearing the mountains
at the Laotian bprder.

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:10.747
OK.

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:17.921
General Vega.

01:10:19.382 --> 01:10:22.634
We just received word that
a military helicopter...

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:25.345
with Guile on board is nearing
the Laotian border.

01:10:25.847 --> 01:10:28.348
Looks like theyˊve located Ryu.

01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:31.143
Guileˊs going to Ryu?

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:36.899
Theyˊre trying to beat me
to the punch.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:41.153
Letˊs take Ken and go see them.

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:44.573
But Ken isnˊt completely...

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:45.782
Thatˊs fine.

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:50.746
Iˊm just going to let them
have a fatal match...

01:10:51.164 --> 01:10:53.874
Then Iˊll come back with Ryu.
Get things ready right away.

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:55.375
Yes, sir.

01:10:58.838 --> 01:11:01.632
General, let me fight Ryu.

01:11:03.551 --> 01:11:07.387
Sagat, youˊre an important
fighter for Shadowlaw.

01:11:07.597 --> 01:11:09.640
Forget that old grudge with Ryu.

01:11:10.225 --> 01:11:14.186
But if I donˊt fight him again,
my honor...

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:17.481
The honor of a fighter...
Meaningless.

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:21.193
Your enemy is now the whole world.

01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:22.653
But...!

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:28.367
Sagat, Shadowlawˊs rules state that
you are not to disobey me!

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:29.993
You know very well.

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.663
I have another order for you.

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:37.292
Go to New York right away and
clean up Balrog and Cammy.

01:11:38.086 --> 01:11:41.129
In Shadowlaw, you are not to fail
executing my plans, either.

01:11:54.852 --> 01:11:57.854
Thailand, in the mountains

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:55.829
Hey Ryu, why donˊt we take a break
and have some tea?

01:12:57.665 --> 01:12:58.373
Sure.

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:02.753
Looks like itˊs going to rain.

01:13:11.512 --> 01:13:12.512
Whatˊs that?

01:13:21.439 --> 01:13:24.941
Ryu, look. Someoneˊs coming.
Odd to get visitors way out here.

01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:43.418
Are you Ken Mastersˊ friend, Ryu?

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:45.712
Yeah. Who are you?

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:48.840
Major Guile, US Air Force.

01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:50.675
Did something happen to Ken?!

01:13:51.386 --> 01:13:54.596
Heˊs been kidnapped by a crime
syndicate called Shadowlaw.

01:13:55.515 --> 01:13:56.431
Kenˊs been kidnapped by Shadowlaw?!

01:13:57.475 --> 01:13:59.684
Heˊll be used to carry out terrorism.

01:14:00.353 --> 01:14:03.146
Ken would neveer lend a hand to
a crime syndicate.

01:14:03.981 --> 01:14:06.024
Theyˊve brainwashed him.

01:14:06.609 --> 01:14:08.276
Kenˊs become a terrorist...

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:14.574
- Vegaˊs personal aircraft!
- What?!

01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:16.827
So many guests today...

01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:25.001
And a rude one at that.

01:14:46.065 --> 01:14:46.690
Ken!

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:56.783
You finally showed up, Vega.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:59.703
Itˊs been a while, Major Guile.

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:04.207
We have all the actors,
and the setting is perfect.

01:15:06.294 --> 01:15:08.628
You...!
What are you gonna do with Ken?!

01:15:09.464 --> 01:15:10.505
Ah, you must be Ryu!

01:15:13.134 --> 01:15:17.304
Ken became a Shadowlaw fighter
in place of you.

01:15:19.474 --> 01:15:21.433
You bastard!
Let Ken go!

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:33.653
Ryu!

01:15:34.822 --> 01:15:36.573
Ken!

01:15:38.868 --> 01:15:39.951
How do you like it, Ryu?

01:15:40.495 --> 01:15:43.788
The current Ken is a killing
machine that I have created.

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:46.082
Will you be able to defeat him?

01:15:46.584 --> 01:15:48.668
Ken, itˊs me, Ryu!

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:55.592
Iˊm sorry, but he canˊt hear his
best friendˊs voice right now.

01:15:56.344 --> 01:15:59.387
He is a machine whose sole
purpose is defeating you.

01:15:59.847 --> 01:16:01.848
Ken, snap out of it!

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:05.477
Vega, I canˊt let criminal scum
like you run rampant!

01:16:07.772 --> 01:16:08.980
Sense of justice, huh...

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:14.694
Guile, an evil mind is
the source of all power.

01:16:18.991 --> 01:16:21.117
Ken here will prove that.

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:25.830
Beating him is faster than
listening to his damn speech.

01:16:26.207 --> 01:16:27.749
Here I come!

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.220
Who are you?

01:16:41.055 --> 01:16:43.765
Iˊll be your opponent!

01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:49.980
Guile, why donˊt you try to
see if you can defeat me?

01:16:50.648 --> 01:16:51.481
Youˊll get your wish.

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:54.442
Ken, itˊs me.
Snap out of it!

01:16:57.238 --> 01:16:57.988
Ken!

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:06.663
Itˊs me, Ryu!

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:09.082
Snap out of it, Ken!

01:17:28.644 --> 01:17:32.647
Whatˊs wrong? Donˊt you want to
avenge your friend? Come at me!

01:17:44.327 --> 01:17:45.452
I wonˊt fall for the same move!

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:54.002
Too easy!

01:18:17.401 --> 01:18:18.526
Oh no!

01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:45.178
Wait... Itˊs not over...yet...

01:18:54.355 --> 01:18:58.400
Ken, wake up! I donˊt want to
fight you like this.

01:18:59.777 --> 01:19:00.944
Snap out of it!

01:19:25.177 --> 01:20:50.428
Ken...

01:20:55.684 --> 01:20:57.227
Ken, itˊs me, Ryu!

01:20:57.978 --> 01:21:01.272
Look at me, Ken!

01:21:06.487 --> 01:21:07.320
Ryu...

01:21:08.823 --> 01:21:09.572
Ken...

01:21:13.953 --> 01:21:15.620
Loser...

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:18.498
STOP!

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:34.180
Ken!

01:21:36.767 --> 01:21:38.768
Get out of my way!

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:43.398
Youˊre going to fight me?
Interesting.

01:21:43.566 --> 01:21:46.317
Let me see how good you are.

01:21:46.902 --> 01:21:48.444
Shut up and get out of my way!

01:21:49.405 --> 01:21:54.117
Quit talking and defeat me.
Then you can go to your friend.

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.119
Move away!

01:22:20.436 --> 01:22:21.394
Iˊm going now.

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:25.565
Yeah. Take care. Iˊll be leaving
here in a few days as well.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.442
When we meet again...

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:29.444
When we see each other next time...

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:35.283
Iˊll be looking forward to it.

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:39.412
You piece of...!

01:22:58.474 --> 01:22:59.641
Ryu, how about it?

01:23:00.351 --> 01:23:05.355
You, too, obey me and become
a chosen fighter of Shadowlaw.

01:23:05.689 --> 01:23:09.233
Cut the crap!
I will never be your lackey!

01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:13.446
You still have strength
to resist me?

01:23:13.989 --> 01:23:15.907
- Impressive.
- Shut up!

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:17.575
Fool.

01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:28.878
I take it youˊre going?

01:23:29.338 --> 01:23:31.881
Yes. I will miss you!

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:38.680
You will someday face someone
you must defeat beyond a match.

01:23:38.973 --> 01:23:42.600
Training means moving forward
toward that day.

01:23:43.477 --> 01:23:44.769
Beyond a match...?

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:50.733
Master, what do you mean,
ˊˊbeyond a matchˊˊ?!

01:23:53.237 --> 01:23:53.695
Master!

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:58.574
I will tell you!

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:10.878
What was that?
What happened?

01:24:11.630 --> 01:24:12.630
I canˊt remember...

01:24:18.095 --> 01:24:19.762
Whatˊs happened to my body?!

01:24:27.771 --> 01:24:28.771
Damn it...

01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:45.788
Thatˊs...

01:24:51.545 --> 01:24:55.423
I get it. Thatˊs the aircraft
that monster was on...

01:24:56.383 --> 01:24:57.550
I remember now.

01:25:01.930 --> 01:25:02.555
Ryu!

01:25:10.481 --> 01:25:11.397
Thatˊs him!

01:25:17.071 --> 01:25:17.653
Vega!

01:25:23.452 --> 01:25:24.118
Ryu!

01:25:32.753 --> 01:25:33.836
My body...!

01:25:45.933 --> 01:25:49.602
Control your breathing and mind, and
cultivate energy into spirit...

01:25:59.822 --> 01:26:01.656
Cultivate energy into spirit...

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:03.407
Cultivate spirit into body...

01:26:04.118 --> 01:26:05.952
Cultivate god to obtain the way...

01:26:06.453 --> 01:26:08.204
Stand up straight as if my head
is being pulled from above...

01:26:08.872 --> 01:26:10.873
Calm the mind and relax the back...

01:26:11.542 --> 01:26:15.795
Concentrate, relax the hip...
Put my weight on one leg...

01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:19.882
Relax the shoulders and arms...
Focus my consciousness...

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:23.761
Harmonize the top and bottom...
Keep the arms and legs moving...

01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:26.222
Find peace in the movements...
Outside are the shapes...

01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:29.976
Inside are the meridians...

01:26:30.352 --> 01:26:32.770
Cultivate spirit with the breath...

01:26:33.397 --> 01:26:36.149
- Yin and yang reach the limit...
- Make the body like steel...

01:26:36.358 --> 01:26:39.402
Create the four elements.
Push the elements to their limit...

01:26:39.570 --> 01:26:41.654
Form the eight symbpls...

01:26:42.156 --> 01:26:44.532
When it reaches the limit
of rigidness...

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:48.077
it becomes soft... When it reaches
the limit of softness...

01:26:48.287 --> 01:26:51.122
it becomes rigid...

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:52.498
Ken!

01:26:53.083 --> 01:26:57.587
Itˊs all about what you
see beyond your fists.

01:26:59.173 --> 01:27:01.507
Ken, wake up!

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:15.479
Ryu...

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:26.616
Whatˊs wrong?
Show your power!

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:45.676
Ken!

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.763
Ryu, we finally meet again.

01:27:50.849 --> 01:27:52.266
Iˊll greet you later.

01:27:55.062 --> 01:27:57.605
- First, we stop this creep!
- Yeah!

01:27:59.441 --> 01:28:03.361
You really want to fight me
no matter what.

01:28:04.529 --> 01:28:08.532
Very well. Iˊll be your opponent
in battle. Come!

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:42.608
Ah, you were able to hit me.
Youˊre as good as I expected.

01:28:50.951 --> 01:28:52.618
Come at me harder!

01:29:06.133 --> 01:29:06.841
Whatˊs wrong?

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:09.427
More!

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:12.054
More! Show me more!

01:29:44.504 --> 01:29:48.049
Even if itˊs brief,
you shook me up.

01:29:48.842 --> 01:29:50.926
This man, Ryu...

01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:53.220
Vega!

01:29:57.768 --> 01:29:58.851
Ken, now!

01:30:07.069 --> 01:30:09.070
This is it!

01:32:06.730 --> 01:32:08.230
- Is this Guile?
- Yeah.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.815
This is New York Central
Hospital calling.

01:32:10.484 --> 01:32:12.443
Please come to the hospital
right away.

01:32:15.405 --> 01:32:15.988
Chun-Li!

01:32:25.415 --> 01:32:26.624
Watch out, you idiot!

01:32:40.805 --> 01:32:43.807
Chun-Li!

01:32:50.524 --> 01:33:06.413
Chun-Li...

01:33:16.258 --> 01:33:19.802
Your father is avenged, as promised.

01:33:23.306 --> 01:33:23.806
I know.

01:33:26.726 --> 01:33:31.188
Joint Interpol/US military operation
to destroy Shadowlaw succeeds!

01:33:32.065 --> 01:33:33.107
Yay, Guile!

01:33:34.234 --> 01:33:36.318
- You brat!
- Sorry!

01:33:36.486 --> 01:33:38.070
I wonˊt forgive you!

01:33:38.446 --> 01:33:40.155
- Sorry!
- You little brat!

01:33:52.335 --> 01:33:56.046
Ryu, next time we see each other,
weˊll finish our match.

01:33:57.340 --> 01:33:57.756
Yeah.

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:21.655
You want a ride?

01:34:22.198 --> 01:34:23.365
Nah, Iˊll walk.

01:34:27.662 --> 01:34:28.704
Where are you going now?

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:30.372
I donˊt know yet.

01:34:34.252 --> 01:34:36.003
Ryu, youˊve become strong.

01:34:36.755 --> 01:34:37.755
You, too.

01:34:39.591 --> 01:34:40.424
