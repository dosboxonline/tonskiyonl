[telephone ringing]

00:19.416 --> 00:20.625
[woman 2] Good day, sir.

00:21.166 --> 00:22.166
[man 1] Good day.

00:22.708 --> 00:23.875
[woman 1] Next, please.

00:43.791 --> 00:47.041
Everybody get down!

00:47.125 --> 00:48.166
[man 2, in Afrikaans] Damn.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.875
[in English] Don't be a hero.
Stay down! Hey!

00:51.958 --> 00:53.291
[man 2, in Afrikaans] Don't shoot.

00:53.791 --> 00:55.708
-[in English] I said down.
-[man 2] Don't shoot.

00:55.791 --> 00:56.625
Move.

00:57.208 --> 00:59.666
-[man 2 exclaims]
-[man 1] Move, move. Down.

01:00.166 --> 01:01.916
Where are you going? Down!

01:02.000 --> 01:02.875
[man 3] Shit!

01:02.958 --> 01:05.916
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is not a bank robbery.

01:06.458 --> 01:09.166
So you stay calm and you go home.

01:09.250 --> 01:10.750
[rhythmic music playing]

01:16.041 --> 01:18.000
My name is Calvin Khumalo.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.583
[explosion]

01:20.666 --> 01:24.250
I was born in Mabopane,
where running water is a luxury.

01:24.958 --> 01:28.333
My comrades and I
grew up in apartheid South Africa,

01:28.416 --> 01:31.541
the most unequal society in the world.

01:32.125 --> 01:36.666
We joined the liberation movement
following the June 16 uprisings,

01:36.750 --> 01:39.583
which left many of our peers dead.

01:39.666 --> 01:43.958
With the majority of our leaders
either imprisoned or in exile,

01:44.041 --> 01:47.000
the youth have made it
their responsibility

01:47.083 --> 01:50.916
to put an end to this unethical system.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.333
The main objective?

01:52.416 --> 01:54.791
Make the country ungovernable.

01:54.875 --> 01:59.500
The white minority regime
has left us with only one option.

01:59.583 --> 02:00.916
Violence.

02:01.708 --> 02:04.375
Our orders from
high command were simple.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.333
Sabotage strategic
key points in the capital,

02:09.208 --> 02:11.416
with no civilian casualties.

02:13.416 --> 02:16.041
That was the plan.

02:19.666 --> 02:23.541
Comrades, Seahorse supplies oil
to the South African Defense Force.

02:23.625 --> 02:24.708
We take the oil.

02:24.791 --> 02:26.291
You take the supply and power.

02:26.375 --> 02:30.375
[Khumalo] We plant the explosives
and hit as many fuel tanks as possible.

02:30.458 --> 02:32.458
[tranquil music playing]

02:33.250 --> 02:36.458
[Khumalo] There's no need for me
to tell you that if we get caught,

02:36.541 --> 02:38.416
there will be no prison time.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.541
Only the rope.

02:49.458 --> 02:51.666
The truck driver
should be here any minute.

02:51.750 --> 02:54.791
We get the signal from him
and we move. Fast.

02:57.291 --> 02:59.416
[suspenseful music playing]

03:16.083 --> 03:17.625
Gents, two minutes.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.333
Terra! Hurry, man!

03:22.416 --> 03:23.750
We don't have much time.

03:23.833 --> 03:24.916
I can't hold it, man!

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
[Terra grunts, exhales]

03:37.958 --> 03:38.875
-Terra…
-Mbali!

03:38.958 --> 03:40.208
Get back in the car.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.958
[in Zulu] Emergency, gentlemen. Jeez.

03:43.041 --> 03:45.375
[suspenseful music continues]

03:45.958 --> 03:47.791
-[in English] He's late.
-He shouldn't be.

03:47.875 --> 03:49.125
[man 1] Can't we go on foot?

03:49.208 --> 03:51.083
We need the truck driver for gate access.

03:51.166 --> 03:54.375
Are you sure it's the right location?
I mean, mistakes happen, huh?

03:55.375 --> 03:57.333
Khumalo doesn't make mistakes.

03:57.416 --> 03:58.958
[suspenseful music continues]

04:01.041 --> 04:01.875
[man 1] Okay.

04:01.958 --> 04:03.958
[radio chatter]

04:04.041 --> 04:05.750
[suspenseful music continues]

04:06.708 --> 04:09.208
These guys have been
off the radar for so long,

04:09.291 --> 04:12.833
but instead of fleeing,
they come back to the capital,

04:12.916 --> 04:15.791
one of the most protected cities
in the whole damn country.

04:16.416 --> 04:17.916
Uh, it makes no sense, man.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.500
[suspenseful music continues]

04:20.416 --> 04:21.916
Makes perfect sense.

04:23.041 --> 04:24.250
This is the arena.

04:24.750 --> 04:26.166
It's the heart of their fight.

04:26.250 --> 04:27.541
[radio] Now, time for the news.

04:27.625 --> 04:31.458
An explosion at the Rooiwal Power Plant
near Pretoria early yesterday morning

04:31.541 --> 04:33.708
has left thousands of homes
without electricity

04:33.791 --> 04:36.791
and caused
millions of rands worth of damage.

04:36.875 --> 04:40.541
This is the latest in a series
of sabotage acts by the terrorists

04:40.625 --> 04:42.916
that have rocked large cities
across South Africa…

04:43.000 --> 04:44.041
Today it stops.

04:44.125 --> 04:46.625

a state of emergency might…

[in English] One's coming out.

05:00.583 --> 05:01.875
Get ready! Get ready!

05:03.291 --> 05:06.208

05:42.500 --> 05:45.375

05:46.625 --> 05:47.708
[in Zulu] No way…

05:50.375 --> 05:51.333

[Terra] Let's move.

05:57.666 --> 05:58.958
Are we doing this or what?

05:59.958 --> 06:02.333
-That's not him. That's not our driver.
-[Terra] What?

06:02.416 --> 06:04.500
-[man 2] Who is he?
-I don't know. Something's wrong.

06:04.583 --> 06:05.958
-Something's not right.
-I feel it.

06:06.041 --> 06:06.916
I can feel it.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.083
Get back inside.

[radio chatter]

06:11.666 --> 06:12.541

06:14.666 --> 06:16.875
[in English] Baker.
I think he's gonna bolt.

13:37.208 --> 13:38.625
[Aldo] Calvin! Calvin!

13:40.833 --> 13:41.708
Calvin!

13:41.791 --> 13:42.708
[Khumalo] Aldo!

13:43.291 --> 13:44.666

13:55.458 --> 13:57.041
-[indistinct shouts]
-[gunfire]

13:58.541 --> 13:59.708
[Khumalo] Come on, Aldo.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.416
[sirens blaring]

14:06.083 --> 14:07.166
[Khumalo] That's it.

14:08.208 --> 14:09.958
[in Zulu] Rabbi, get down! Down!

14:10.041 --> 14:11.375
[Aldo] Move, clear!

14:11.458 --> 14:13.833
[rhythmic music continues]

14:13.916 --> 14:16.291
[indistinct shouts]

14:18.875 --> 14:20.125
[Khumalo] Go, go!

14:20.208 --> 14:23.083
-[in English] Move.
-Move! Move!

14:23.166 --> 14:24.333
[Khumalo] Everybody down!

14:24.416 --> 14:26.458
Move! Let's go!

14:26.541 --> 14:27.791
Move!

14:28.833 --> 14:29.833
[sirens blaring]

14:31.083 --> 14:32.583
[Khumalo, in Zulu] Go past!

14:32.666 --> 14:33.958
[in English] Everybody down!

14:35.083 --> 14:36.750
Everybody down!

14:36.833 --> 14:38.416
Go!

14:38.500 --> 14:39.916
[rhythmic music continues]

14:40.000 --> 14:41.375
[tires screech]

14:42.708 --> 14:44.333
[Khumalo] Go back! Go back!

14:44.916 --> 14:46.625
[Terra, in Zulu]
What kind of shit is this?

14:48.083 --> 14:49.791
[in English] We're trapped!

14:49.875 --> 14:51.083
[woman gasps, exclaims]

14:51.166 --> 14:52.208
Oh my God!

14:52.708 --> 14:54.250
[Khumalo] Move!

14:55.333 --> 14:57.000
[in Zulu] Hurry, Ma. Go!

14:57.083 --> 14:57.916
[in English] Move!

15:05.291 --> 15:07.916
Hold your fire. I repeat, hold your fire!

15:09.375 --> 15:10.416
Secure.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.083
[telephone ringing]

15:31.000 --> 15:32.250
[woman] Next, please.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.416
[Khumalo breathes heavily]

15:41.708 --> 15:42.791
It's a bank.

15:47.625 --> 15:49.625
[telephone ringing]

15:52.333 --> 15:54.083
[in Zulu] Gents, what are we going to do?

15:54.666 --> 15:56.708
-[in English] This is bad.
-Calm down.

15:57.250 --> 15:59.125
Terra, your side. Move.

15:59.791 --> 16:01.250
Aldo, your side.

16:07.791 --> 16:10.000
-[man pops tongue]
-Could you stop that?

16:10.083 --> 16:11.541
It's rather disgusting.

16:13.666 --> 16:15.666
Well, hello to you too, beautiful.

16:16.541 --> 16:20.083
By the way,
you are definitely in the wrong line.

16:20.833 --> 16:22.500
No, actually…

16:23.750 --> 16:25.166
I'm in the right line.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.916
Name's Washington, Cornelius Washington.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.000
Now that's cold.

16:29.083 --> 16:30.916
[in Afrikaans] What you think
you're doing, boy?

16:31.416 --> 16:34.583
[in English] Excuse me?
Um, who you calling a boy?

16:34.666 --> 16:36.708
Don't play dumb with me.
You're in the wrong line.

16:36.791 --> 16:38.416
Whites only. Blacks that side.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.791
Get your hands off me. I'm an American.

16:41.875 --> 16:43.083
Is it?

16:43.166 --> 16:45.625
Well, you're in Africa now, boy!

16:45.708 --> 16:48.000
He's the American citizen
that phoned in yesterday.

16:48.083 --> 16:50.791
Damn Skippy. What? A man can't breathe?

16:50.875 --> 16:52.541
[in Afrikaans] You didn't say he's Black.

16:53.125 --> 16:54.500
[in English] Did I have to?

16:55.041 --> 16:57.375
[in Afrikaans] Johan, let him go. Johan.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.791
[in English] Apologies, Mr. Washington.
Um… [sighs]

17:04.500 --> 17:05.833
Don't even worry about it.

17:05.916 --> 17:08.000
I'm from Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Hmm.

17:08.083 --> 17:10.958
I deal with dumbass rednecks all the time.

17:11.666 --> 17:13.166
Thanks for understanding.

17:15.625 --> 17:17.083
[siren blaring]

17:17.583 --> 17:20.375
All right, everybody, listen up.

17:20.458 --> 17:22.375
This is now a hostage situation.

17:23.583 --> 17:26.458
Nobody goes in this bank, nobody goes out.

17:26.541 --> 17:28.666
We need a command post over there.

17:28.750 --> 17:30.208
Schoeman, set up phone lines.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.583
Good day, sir.

17:33.333 --> 17:34.208
Good day.

17:34.291 --> 17:35.500
[woman] Next, please.

17:35.583 --> 17:37.125
[suspenseful music playing]

17:47.291 --> 17:48.125
[gun cocks]

17:50.041 --> 17:51.250
[gun fires]

17:51.333 --> 17:52.458
[crowd yells]

17:52.541 --> 17:55.000
Captain, they're already
shooting at the hostages.

17:55.625 --> 17:57.750
No, not yet. It's too soon.

17:59.333 --> 18:00.416
Get me a bullhorn.

18:00.500 --> 18:03.083
[Khumalo] Everybody down!

18:03.833 --> 18:05.416
Don't play a hero.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.666
[Aldo] Move!

18:06.750 --> 18:08.458
[Khumalo] Stay down!

18:09.000 --> 18:10.875
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

18:10.958 --> 18:11.916
Come here.

18:12.833 --> 18:14.833
-Down!
-[Johan] Don't shoot.

18:14.916 --> 18:17.125
-[Khumalo] Move. Hey.
-[Johan grunts]

18:17.208 --> 18:19.291
[Khumalo] Down, down, down!

18:19.375 --> 18:20.541
Where are you going?

18:21.458 --> 18:22.625
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:22.708 --> 18:24.666
this is not a bank robbery.

18:24.750 --> 18:27.208
So you stay calm and you go home.

18:27.291 --> 18:29.375
Stay calm, go home.

18:29.916 --> 18:31.166
[in Zulu] Hold fast!

18:31.250 --> 18:32.750
[Terra, Aldo] Hold fast!

18:32.833 --> 18:34.833
[suspenseful music continues]

18:49.000 --> 18:51.083
-[Aldo, in English] Move!
-Okay, okay.

18:51.166 --> 18:52.583
Hey, give.

18:52.666 --> 18:55.958
Okay. Please don't shoot me.
I have a two-year-old daughter.

18:56.041 --> 18:58.583
And if you want to see her again,
don't try any tricks.

18:58.666 --> 19:00.541
-Okay. Sorry.
-[Aldo] Move.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.000
-Get up!
-[hostages cry out]

19:03.083 --> 19:05.541
[suspenseful music continues]

19:17.041 --> 19:19.458
[nervous panting]

19:20.333 --> 19:22.958
Um… Please don't hurt me.

19:23.458 --> 19:25.583
Money's in the vault.
Just don't hurt anyone.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.666
Take the money. Just don't hurt anyone.

19:27.750 --> 19:28.666
Move.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.083
-Okay.
-[Khumalo] Now.

19:33.875 --> 19:34.875
Hurry.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
[woman] I could show you
where the vault is.

19:39.666 --> 19:41.041
This isn't a bank robbery.

19:43.000 --> 19:43.875
Then what is it?

19:45.375 --> 19:46.250
What's your name?

19:46.333 --> 19:48.541
Christine. I'm the supervisor.

19:48.625 --> 19:50.166
Christine the supervisor.

19:50.708 --> 19:51.916
Is there a back way out?

19:52.000 --> 19:54.166
No, only the front.

19:54.250 --> 19:55.208
Move.

19:55.833 --> 19:58.333
-Move!
-[nervously] Okay. Okay, okay.

19:59.291 --> 20:00.458
[Aldo] Get up!

20:00.541 --> 20:02.791
-[frightened cries]
-[suspenseful music continues]

20:04.916 --> 20:06.916
[Aldo panting]

20:10.750 --> 20:12.375
[Khumalo] On the floor.

20:12.458 --> 20:14.250
Not there, in there! Move.

20:14.750 --> 20:15.625
[Aldo] Sit.

20:15.708 --> 20:17.625
[Khumalo, in Zulu] What's this? Hello.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.750
Looks like this one has issues.

20:23.125 --> 20:24.833
[in English] That means you too.

20:36.750 --> 20:38.250
-It's filthy.
-[Terra mocks]

20:38.333 --> 20:39.333
[in Sotho] Sit down!

20:39.416 --> 20:40.750
Don't get on my nerves.

20:40.833 --> 20:42.583
[in English] Move! Move, let's go.

20:42.666 --> 20:44.458
[in Zulu] Ladies too.
[in English] Let's go!

20:44.541 --> 20:45.500
[woman sobs]

20:45.583 --> 20:46.625
[Schoeman] Captain.

20:46.708 --> 20:49.708
Captain. I think we might have something.

20:49.791 --> 20:50.875
Yeah?

20:51.625 --> 20:54.833
I'm not moving.
I'm not going anywhere. Whatever…

20:54.916 --> 20:56.750
-[Langerman] Who's she?
-[Schoeman] Name's Jane.

20:56.833 --> 20:59.708
She claims to be related
to the bank supervisor.

20:59.791 --> 21:03.125
A woman, white, by the name of Christine.
She says she can help.

21:03.708 --> 21:05.166
-What do you think?
-I'm not moving…

21:05.250 --> 21:07.833
Let's keep her close.
We might need her later.

21:10.833 --> 21:13.500
[indistinct commotion]

21:16.541 --> 21:17.708
I can't go out like this.

21:18.333 --> 21:20.000
Khensani's pregnant.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.041
[in Zulu] I know.

21:22.125 --> 21:23.750
[in English] Just get your mind off it.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.625
[clock ticking]

21:34.375 --> 21:35.333
Erasmus…

21:36.416 --> 21:37.625
we've been betrayed.

21:39.416 --> 21:41.375
Khumalo has a lot of explaining to do.

21:42.916 --> 21:45.333
I don't know. Not Calvin.

21:45.416 --> 21:46.500
[Terra] Then who?

21:47.166 --> 21:49.291
[Aldo] Someone in high command
sold us out.

21:51.416 --> 21:52.625
I want answers.

21:53.583 --> 21:55.000
And I want them now.

22:09.750 --> 22:11.000
[birds flutter]

22:14.125 --> 22:15.000
[woman shouts]

22:18.000 --> 22:19.291
-[screams]
-[glass shatters]

22:21.291 --> 22:22.125
[man] Shit!

22:22.208 --> 22:24.125
If anyone comes near those windows,

22:24.208 --> 22:26.041
shoot them all!

22:26.125 --> 22:31.375
Calvin Khumalo,
Aldo Erasmus, Mbali Terra Mabunda.

22:31.458 --> 22:33.291
We have the entire building surrounded.

22:33.375 --> 22:34.916
[in Zulu] How's he know our names?

22:35.000 --> 22:37.541
Never mind our names.
How did he know about the mission?

22:37.625 --> 22:41.291
[in English] Surrender your weapons and
come out with your hands above your head.

22:41.375 --> 22:44.791
-[in Zulu] Maybe the truck driver?
-No. All the truck driver knew

22:44.875 --> 22:47.458
was to meet us there
and drive us in. That's it.

22:47.541 --> 22:49.125
This guy knew everything.

22:49.208 --> 22:51.208
[intense music playing]

22:56.416 --> 22:58.125
[in English] Someone had to have told him.

22:58.208 --> 23:01.875
[Langerman] I repeat, Calvin,
we have the building surrounded.

23:01.958 --> 23:03.708
[in Zulu] Don't look at me.

23:04.416 --> 23:07.250
I lost Masego today. Don't piss me off.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.583
There were other units
on the Seahorse mission.

23:09.666 --> 23:12.166
[Langerman, in English] Come out
with your hands above your head.

23:12.250 --> 23:13.500
[intense music continues]

23:25.833 --> 23:27.833
[ringing tone]

23:28.666 --> 23:30.125
What are we gonna do?

23:30.208 --> 23:32.208
[telephone ringing]

23:33.375 --> 23:34.458
Get out.

23:40.583 --> 23:41.958
[Langerman] Calvin Khumalo?

23:42.041 --> 23:44.916
[in Afrikaans] I'm Captain Langerman.
South African Police.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.875
We met outside the bank.

23:46.958 --> 23:48.041
[in English] English.

23:48.541 --> 23:49.791
How do you know our names?

23:49.875 --> 23:51.625
We've been tracking you for months.

23:51.708 --> 23:53.958
We know you were behind the Rooiwal job.

23:54.875 --> 23:57.916
You don't speak Afrikaans,
yet you call yourself a South African?

23:58.000 --> 23:59.333
Do you speak Zulu?

24:00.208 --> 24:01.125
[Langerman] No.

24:01.208 --> 24:02.916
Your people have been here 400 years

24:03.000 --> 24:05.333
and you haven't bothered
to learn an indigenous language,

24:05.416 --> 24:07.166
yet you call yourself a South African?

24:07.250 --> 24:09.416
Let's not get off on the wrong foot. Okay?

24:09.500 --> 24:11.041
[Khumalo] Too late for that, Captain.

24:11.125 --> 24:12.500
You've got to understand,

24:13.125 --> 24:15.083
this is Pretoria.

24:16.041 --> 24:18.250
By taking over this square

24:18.333 --> 24:19.583
and this bank,

24:19.666 --> 24:22.000
you're spitting in the face
of the Afrikaner nation.

24:22.083 --> 24:24.291
I don't give a damn
about the Afrikaner nation.

24:24.375 --> 24:27.291
They've taken apart my family,
and they've taken apart many more.

24:27.375 --> 24:32.458
My point is that it is going
to be up to you and me to resolve this.

24:32.541 --> 24:33.875
Peacefully and quickly.

24:34.458 --> 24:36.875
Otherwise, it's going to end badly.

24:37.916 --> 24:39.083
For everyone.

24:39.750 --> 24:41.041
[Khumalo] Listen here…

24:41.125 --> 24:42.708
This is what's going to happen.

24:42.791 --> 24:45.416
Me and my comrades
are going to walk out of here safely.

24:45.500 --> 24:48.083
Unless you want us to start
throwing bodies out the door.

24:48.166 --> 24:49.833
[repeats] No.

24:49.916 --> 24:52.000
Nobody needs to get hurt, Calvin.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.583
I'll get you what you want.

24:53.666 --> 24:54.750
I want a helicopter.

24:54.833 --> 24:56.875
I want an unarmed pilot.

24:56.958 --> 24:59.375
And I want safe passage
to a location of our choosing,

24:59.458 --> 25:02.375
which I will tell the pilot
once we're airborne, no tricks.

25:02.458 --> 25:03.458
Do you understand me?

25:03.541 --> 25:04.500
Fine.

25:04.583 --> 25:05.541
[Khumalo] Captain,

25:05.625 --> 25:08.000
we have an American citizen in here.

25:08.625 --> 25:10.291
He'll be traveling with us.

25:10.375 --> 25:11.750
You have 20 minutes.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.333
Get ready to move out.

25:16.583 --> 25:17.541
Captain!

25:18.708 --> 25:20.625
[Langerman] No. Not now. Not now.

25:22.375 --> 25:23.500
[reporter] Captain.

25:24.333 --> 25:25.833
You think this will work?

25:25.916 --> 25:27.208
This is perfect.

25:28.666 --> 25:30.875
[both sigh]

25:30.958 --> 25:32.833
With all due respect, Captain…

25:36.625 --> 25:39.458
this could get messy very quickly.

25:39.541 --> 25:42.375
But better it gets messy
out here than in the bank.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.958
Get me the helicopter.
Let's get them outside.

25:47.041 --> 25:48.541
[tense music playing]

25:54.500 --> 25:56.041
[indistinct crowd chatter]

26:02.500 --> 26:05.041
[tense music builds]

26:16.541 --> 26:18.541
[Schoeman] Captain, let's do this…

26:19.791 --> 26:21.666
They're coming in!

26:33.750 --> 26:35.083
Hey, brother.

26:35.166 --> 26:36.375
You okay?

26:40.333 --> 26:41.833
We're getting out of here.

26:42.666 --> 26:43.833
Soon.

26:43.916 --> 26:45.750
You are going back to Khensani.

26:46.500 --> 26:48.166
Do you really believe that?

26:48.250 --> 26:52.291
[Khumalo] After this, you'll be holding
your newborn baby in your arms.

26:52.375 --> 26:53.375
[exhales shakily]

26:53.458 --> 26:54.708
[Khumalo] Come on, Aldo.

26:55.291 --> 26:58.291
I know today has been a rough day.

26:58.375 --> 26:59.916
I know we lost Masego. But…

27:00.458 --> 27:03.083
we've been through far worse situations.

27:04.500 --> 27:05.333
And…

27:05.416 --> 27:08.125
-And Terra hasn't killed anyone yet. So…
-[Aldo laughs]

27:08.791 --> 27:10.500
we're going to be okay.

27:10.583 --> 27:11.833
[both laugh]

27:12.916 --> 27:14.750
Let's go home, okay?

27:15.625 --> 27:17.500
Let's go home. Let's go.

27:18.541 --> 27:19.708
Ladies and gentlemen.

27:20.875 --> 27:24.166
We would like to thank you
for your kind cooperation.

27:24.250 --> 27:26.458
And give our sincere apologies

27:26.541 --> 27:29.250
for any inconvenience caused.

27:30.291 --> 27:33.083
We did not intend to be here.
But here we are.

27:33.666 --> 27:38.208
Unfortunately, for me
and my comrades to depart,

27:39.416 --> 27:41.166
we are going to need

27:42.083 --> 27:43.291
a volunteer.

27:43.375 --> 27:47.500
Man, I'm Black, just like you.
I ain't got nothing to do with this.

27:47.583 --> 27:48.625
Oh.

27:49.750 --> 27:51.458
So now you're Black.

27:52.916 --> 27:54.625
You do make a valid point.

27:55.208 --> 27:56.291
You are Black.

27:58.333 --> 28:00.916
Just like me.

28:07.541 --> 28:09.583
You. You'll be our American.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.458
[Langerman] Targets are exiting the bank.

28:14.541 --> 28:15.666
[cameras click]

28:15.750 --> 28:17.083
Nice and easy.

28:19.291 --> 28:21.375
["Zombie" by Fela Kuti playing]

28:30.416 --> 28:32.583
They're heading towards the helicopter.

28:32.666 --> 28:34.125
[song continues]

28:35.166 --> 28:36.208
Terra.

28:41.750 --> 28:44.000
-How long you been in the police force?
-I'm not.

28:44.083 --> 28:46.041
This is a '64 Alouette, French-made,

28:46.125 --> 28:47.333
used in the Matola Raid.

28:47.416 --> 28:48.500
You know your stuff.

28:49.375 --> 28:50.500
Matola Raid.

28:51.083 --> 28:53.291
So don't try any tricks. Move.

28:53.375 --> 28:54.208
[in Zulu] Let's go.

28:54.291 --> 28:55.708

29:04.333 --> 29:06.500

Targets are now entering the helicopter.

29:06.583 --> 29:07.958
Copied, Captain. We're clear.

29:08.041 --> 29:09.416
We are clear.

29:11.125 --> 29:12.208
Let's move it.

29:13.166 --> 29:14.333
[Terra] Okay, let's go.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.166
Something's wrong.

29:16.250 --> 29:17.208
[Khumalo] Aldo, move in!

29:17.291 --> 29:18.375
Calvin I… I don't…

29:18.458 --> 29:19.750
[Khumalo] What are you doing?

29:19.833 --> 29:21.041
Schoeman, what do you hear?

29:21.125 --> 29:22.666
[Terra] Aldo, let's go!

29:23.791 --> 29:26.291
Aldo, man. You have to trust me.
Come, let's move!

29:26.375 --> 29:28.041
-This is too easy.
-Move.

29:28.125 --> 29:29.083
Calvin!

Come on, dog. Move.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.250
[in English] Back to the bank!

29:54.333 --> 29:55.916
Everybody move!

29:56.958 --> 29:59.458
The hostage in the white shirt
is not American. He's a Boer.

-[Langerman, in English] Do not fire.

30:02.625 --> 30:04.166

I see you, you messed up!

30:06.041 --> 30:07.958
-[Langerman] What happened?
-[Khumalo] You know!

30:08.041 --> 30:09.000
Damn it!

-[Khumalo] Move.
-[Terra] Get back!

30:17.625 --> 30:19.000
[Khumalo] Move.

30:30.416 --> 30:32.500
You are alone now. Do you hear me?

30:32.583 --> 30:34.041
-You are alone now.
-[moaning] No.

30:34.125 --> 30:35.375
-[Schoeman] No!
-Schoeman?

30:35.458 --> 30:36.458
We've lost the signal.

30:36.541 --> 30:38.416
[in Afrikaans] We've lost the signal.

30:40.875 --> 30:42.666
[Khumalo laughs]

30:42.750 --> 30:46.458
[in English] Huh? Triple seven.
A Black white supremacist.

30:46.541 --> 30:47.583
It's not what you think.

30:47.666 --> 30:50.125
[in Zulu] You're a piece of crap.

30:50.208 --> 30:52.125
[in English] Move! On the floor.

30:52.208 --> 30:53.375
On the floor!

30:53.458 --> 30:55.458
[shouting, screaming]

31:00.875 --> 31:03.291
[Aldo] I knew
they weren't gonna let us fly away.

31:05.833 --> 31:08.000
Calvin. I'm… I'm sorry.

31:10.416 --> 31:11.541
I should have listened.

31:12.125 --> 31:14.916
You're sorry? You're sorry?

31:17.375 --> 31:19.375
I'll show you sorry, son of a bitch.

31:19.458 --> 31:21.541
I should have just killed you myself.

31:22.416 --> 31:23.791
[grunting]

31:24.625 --> 31:25.875
What about Masego?

31:25.958 --> 31:28.375
-You selfish piece of shit!
-Go to hell, Terra!

31:28.458 --> 31:30.458
[Terra] You'll go to hell!
I'll show you hell.

31:30.541 --> 31:31.666
Enough!

31:31.750 --> 31:33.458
Terra, please. I understand, okay?

31:33.541 --> 31:34.875
[in Zulu] He nearly had us killed.

31:34.958 --> 31:36.958
[in English] We'd be dead
if it wasn't for him, okay?

31:37.500 --> 31:38.625
[in Pidgin] Please…

31:40.458 --> 31:42.041
[in English] I'm bleeding here.

31:44.125 --> 31:45.125
[in Zulu] Come here.

31:48.125 --> 31:49.583
[in English] Get up!

31:49.666 --> 31:50.583
[Khumalo] Terra!

31:50.666 --> 31:51.500

32:00.083 --> 32:01.708
Get in. Get in!

32:02.666 --> 32:04.500
[in English] Big men with guns, huh?

32:05.500 --> 32:08.333
But you're nothing
but a bunch of terrorists.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.416
[grunts]

32:12.708 --> 32:13.541
[in Zulu] Get up.

32:13.625 --> 32:15.875
[in English] Busy working
for the white man? Get up, boy!

32:15.958 --> 32:17.416
Who's the bloody informer?

32:17.500 --> 32:20.708
On your bloody knees.
On your bloody knees. Shit!

32:20.791 --> 32:23.291
-Who is the bloody informer?
-[pilot] I don't--

32:25.000 --> 32:26.250
[gurgles]

32:26.333 --> 32:28.333
-[pilot gasping]
-[in Zulu] Talk!

32:28.416 --> 32:29.625
-I don't know.
-[Terra] Lies!

32:29.708 --> 32:30.666
[in English] Shit!

32:34.375 --> 32:36.750
[in English] I don't know.
I'm just a pilot.

32:38.291 --> 32:39.125
Terra.

32:40.791 --> 32:43.291
Because of people like him,
Masego is dead.

32:43.375 --> 32:44.375
Terra…

32:45.125 --> 32:46.375
[in Zulu] Go cool off.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.458
[pilot coughs]

32:52.791 --> 32:54.416
[pilot gasps]

33:00.375 --> 33:03.083
[in English] The police knew about
the Seahorse Oil mission

33:03.625 --> 33:05.250
because somebody told them.

33:07.041 --> 33:09.916
See, the way I see it,
you have two options.

33:11.375 --> 33:14.250
Tell me nothing and die in this bank, or…

33:16.375 --> 33:18.208
you tell me who the informant is

33:18.791 --> 33:19.791
and you'll live.

33:19.875 --> 33:21.166
I don't know.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.125
I wasn't part of the operation.

33:23.208 --> 33:24.333
Then why were you armed?

33:24.416 --> 33:28.041
They put the gun in the helicopter
so I could take you out

33:28.791 --> 33:30.833
once you told us your location.

33:31.458 --> 33:33.500
They would be waiting for you there…

33:34.208 --> 33:35.583
in an ambush.

33:35.666 --> 33:37.416
Brigadier's orders.

33:38.458 --> 33:40.166
You have to realize one thing.

33:41.375 --> 33:44.125
There's only one of two ways
you're leaving this bank.

33:45.625 --> 33:46.750
Prison

33:47.375 --> 33:48.250
or death.

33:48.333 --> 33:49.958
[suspenseful music playing]

33:53.166 --> 33:54.666
They found the wiretap.

33:54.750 --> 33:56.208
[suspenseful music continues]

33:58.333 --> 34:01.125
Just when you think
your day couldn't get any worse.

34:01.791 --> 34:02.916
[Schoeman] Yeah.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.416
[in Afrikaans]
The Little Crocodile is here.

34:38.250 --> 34:39.791
[in Afrikaans] Captain Langerman.

34:39.875 --> 34:41.291
Brigadier.

34:41.375 --> 34:44.541
The Big Crocodile is dying to see you.
And he's on the warpath.

34:44.625 --> 34:47.583
-Brigadier, we've been on this case--
-[Brigadier] I'm not talking to you.

34:50.958 --> 34:51.833
What's that?

34:52.750 --> 34:54.416
[Schoeman] It's a helicopter, Brigadier.

34:54.500 --> 34:56.500
I know what it is, Schoeman.

34:57.458 --> 34:59.958
But why is it standing there?
In front of Uncle Paul?

35:01.250 --> 35:02.166
Fix it.

35:06.625 --> 35:08.250
Oh, and…

35:08.333 --> 35:11.041
Have you seen the bank manifest?

35:14.166 --> 35:19.833
The Justice Minister's daughter,
Christine, is one of the hostages.

35:20.875 --> 35:22.125
Really, sir?

35:25.958 --> 35:28.333
Yes, Schoeman. Really.

35:28.958 --> 35:30.500
That's why I'm here.

35:30.583 --> 35:34.583
With all the horses, the dogs,
the guns, the soldiers, and everything.

35:39.625 --> 35:41.250
This crap stops now.

35:41.958 --> 35:43.500
Do you understand me, Captain?

35:43.583 --> 35:45.583

35:50.250 --> 35:51.791

36:29.541 --> 36:31.541
[suspenseful music fades]

36:37.000 --> 36:39.000
[Khumalo, in English] What's in that case?

36:39.708 --> 36:40.833
What do you think?

36:42.291 --> 36:43.791
Wait, hang on, man.

36:43.875 --> 36:45.750
Why don't you say we make a deal, huh?

36:46.583 --> 36:47.916
You want money?

36:48.000 --> 36:48.958
All right.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.291
Here you go.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.458
Look, I don't want your money, okay?

36:52.541 --> 36:54.875
Come on, man. Who doesn't want money, huh?

36:54.958 --> 36:56.291
I'm a boxing promoter.

36:56.375 --> 36:59.291
You know that big fight with
John Tate and Gerrie Coetzee, huh?

36:59.833 --> 37:03.166
Well, how about Nelson Mandela?
You know Mandela, right?

37:03.250 --> 37:04.541
He's a boxer.

37:05.458 --> 37:06.541
Just let me go.

37:07.083 --> 37:09.083
[dramatic music playing]

37:12.708 --> 37:13.875
[laughs softly]

37:15.500 --> 37:16.333
That's it.

37:16.416 --> 37:17.291
It is?

37:19.166 --> 37:21.250
-Hey!
-[Cornelius] Whoa, easy.

37:24.833 --> 37:25.875
[Terra] What is it?

37:27.458 --> 37:28.875
I have a plan.

37:28.958 --> 37:30.583
Hey, so we have a deal or what?

37:30.666 --> 37:31.750
[Aldo] Just sit down!

37:31.833 --> 37:34.000
Excuse me. When do we get to leave?

37:35.416 --> 37:37.208
These people need food and water

37:37.291 --> 37:39.750
and they need
to relieve themselves, please.

37:42.000 --> 37:43.250
[in Zulu] What's the plan?

37:47.000 --> 37:49.375
-[in English] They're won't let us out.
-I'm not surrendering.

37:49.458 --> 37:51.375
[Khumalo] That's not what I'm saying.

37:51.458 --> 37:52.666
Think about it.

37:53.458 --> 37:55.958
They've been trying
to kill us since the depot.

37:56.458 --> 37:58.833
I know I've never let
you guys down before, but…

38:00.416 --> 38:01.583
but today, I have.

38:03.041 --> 38:05.041
This could be our last mission.

38:06.375 --> 38:07.208
But…

38:08.041 --> 38:10.666

the one to pay for it.

50:19.375 --> 50:20.208
Then who must?

50:20.291 --> 50:21.541
Who must?

50:21.625 --> 50:23.125
Maybe you don't understand.

50:23.208 --> 50:25.541
As long as one of us is in chains,
none of us are free.

50:25.625 --> 50:26.875
Save it, man.

50:31.583 --> 50:32.791
[in Zulu] No, Khumalo.

50:38.250 --> 50:39.750
[Terra exhales]

50:39.833 --> 50:42.000
[in Zulu] That bloody captain
is a piece of shit.

50:43.625 --> 50:44.708
I swear…

50:44.791 --> 50:46.458
[in English]
I don't care what Khumalo says,

50:46.541 --> 50:48.291
if I get a chance to avenge Masego,

50:48.375 --> 50:49.500
I'm going to do it.

50:50.125 --> 50:52.125
Captain Langerman
will get what he deserves.

50:52.208 --> 50:53.500
I guarantee it.

50:54.208 --> 50:55.833
[pilot in Afrikaans] Excuse me.

50:55.916 --> 50:58.541
[in English] I'm bleeding.
I need the bathroom, please.

50:59.041 --> 51:01.791
[in Zulu] Erasmus, please
deal with this dog before I kill him.

51:08.166 --> 51:10.041
-[in English] Get up.
-[Christine] What happened?

51:10.125 --> 51:12.041
I almost got shot. That's what happened.

51:12.916 --> 51:15.291
They were talking about freeing Mandela.

51:15.375 --> 51:17.333
-And they made me burn the money.
-What?

51:17.416 --> 51:18.750
I'm gonna go talk to him.

51:18.833 --> 51:21.333
[in Afrikaans] Christine, you mad?
What do you think you're doing?

51:21.416 --> 51:24.291
[in English] You're not in this alone,
Miss Fancy Pants. Coming with you.

51:27.875 --> 51:29.791
-We need to talk to you.
-About what?

51:29.875 --> 51:32.416
We've asked for food and water.
We haven't received any.

51:32.500 --> 51:33.833
[Khumalo] It's on the way.

51:33.916 --> 51:36.291
You know, from the moment
you walked into this bank,

51:36.375 --> 51:39.125
you messed up everyone's life,
including your own.

51:39.208 --> 51:41.208
[chuckles]

51:41.791 --> 51:44.291
I messed up everyone's life? Me?

51:45.375 --> 51:48.166
I'm not the reason you're standing
in a line you shouldn't be.

51:48.250 --> 51:50.833
-Doesn't matter what line I stand in.
-[Khumalo] It shouldn't.

51:50.916 --> 51:53.875
But we live in a country
where it does for people like us.

51:53.958 --> 51:55.583
[scoffs] That's where you're wrong.

51:56.083 --> 51:58.125
Me, you…

51:58.833 --> 52:00.083
we're not the same.

52:00.166 --> 52:02.500
I think we're more alike
than you'd like to admit.

52:02.583 --> 52:03.625
I know your type.

52:04.125 --> 52:06.750
You think you're special,
different from the rest.

52:06.833 --> 52:08.458
But truly, you're not.

52:08.541 --> 52:10.208
Does that remind you of anyone?

52:10.291 --> 52:12.875
Maybe you're right.
But that still doesn't change the fact

52:12.958 --> 52:15.250
that what you're trying
to do here is impossible.

52:15.333 --> 52:16.583
You know, a man once said,

52:16.666 --> 52:19.375
"It always seems impossible
until it's done."

52:19.458 --> 52:22.541
That's a wise man
and those are beautiful words.

52:23.541 --> 52:24.708
But what's your plan?

52:24.791 --> 52:25.958
This is the plan!

52:26.041 --> 52:27.333
To burn money?

52:27.416 --> 52:29.083
How are you gonna get out of here?

52:29.166 --> 52:32.250
The police consider Mandela
to be the highest form of terrorist.

52:32.333 --> 52:34.708
Burn all the money you want,
they won't release him.

52:34.791 --> 52:37.625
I don't have to explain myself
to any of you.

52:37.708 --> 52:39.000
Now go sit down, now!

52:39.750 --> 52:40.958
Go!

52:42.250 --> 52:45.208
And that wise man,
that wise man who said that,

52:45.958 --> 52:47.500
that's Nelson Mandela.

52:48.333 --> 52:50.250
That's the man we're trying to free.

52:52.666 --> 52:53.916
Go sit down.

52:54.750 --> 52:57.958
[pilot] You know, it's only a matter
of time before the police come in here.

52:58.916 --> 53:02.708
When they do, they'll kill
you and everyone else in here.

53:03.625 --> 53:05.583
I don't wanna be caught in the crossfire.

53:05.666 --> 53:08.916
[Aldo] Hey, tell someone
who gives a shit, okay?

53:09.000 --> 53:10.583
You ought to give a shit.

53:10.666 --> 53:13.250
I ought to kill you myself
if we don't start moving.

53:13.333 --> 53:14.333
[in Zulu] Let's go.

53:14.875 --> 53:16.916
[in English] The minute you
start releasing hostages…

53:17.458 --> 53:19.583
I want to be the first on that list.

53:19.666 --> 53:21.416
And why would I do that?

53:21.500 --> 53:22.583
[scoffs]

53:23.375 --> 53:25.500
Because if you don't, Aldo,

53:26.666 --> 53:30.625
I'll tell your friends
who the real informant is.

53:34.708 --> 53:36.750
Don't forget about our agreement.

53:37.250 --> 53:39.333
Remember, we know where your wife is.

53:39.416 --> 53:40.666
[ominous music builds]

53:41.375 --> 53:42.458
[Aldo] You know what?

53:43.208 --> 53:44.291
You're right.

53:44.375 --> 53:45.458
Keep your friends…

53:46.291 --> 53:47.333
close.

53:48.041 --> 53:51.083
No one threatens my family.

53:51.166 --> 53:53.041
-[squelch]
-[pilot grunts]

53:55.625 --> 53:56.583
[thud]

53:57.375 --> 53:59.375
[panting]

54:01.041 --> 54:03.041
[ominous music continues]

54:10.166 --> 54:12.166
[cries]

54:13.375 --> 54:15.708
[panting]

54:20.916 --> 54:22.000
[thud]

54:36.208 --> 54:37.291
Aldo!

54:37.375 --> 54:38.375
Aldo.

54:38.875 --> 54:39.833
Aldo, what happened?

54:40.666 --> 54:42.166
He tried to kill me.

54:45.916 --> 54:46.750
[exhales]

54:47.500 --> 54:48.375
Okay, Aldo.

54:48.458 --> 54:50.000
Up, Aldo. Aldo, up.

54:52.541 --> 54:53.666
Listen to me.

54:53.750 --> 54:55.166
No one can find out about this.

54:55.250 --> 54:57.291
If they do, they'll storm this bank.

54:57.375 --> 54:58.458
Let's grab him.

55:00.291 --> 55:01.125
[both grunt]

55:11.916 --> 55:13.541
[both grunting]

55:13.625 --> 55:14.833
[Khumalo] Get his legs.

55:28.333 --> 55:30.458
You've got blood on your hands, Comrade.

55:31.041 --> 55:32.083
Clean it off.

55:34.916 --> 55:35.958
[telephone ringing]

55:46.041 --> 55:47.958
Hey, we want food and water.

55:48.041 --> 55:51.125
I can do that for you,
but I need a favor in return.

55:51.708 --> 55:52.750
Two hostages.

55:52.833 --> 55:53.916
Four.

55:54.000 --> 55:54.916
[Khumalo] Two.

55:55.625 --> 55:56.541
Okay.

55:57.250 --> 55:59.541
But I need one of them to be Christine.

56:00.750 --> 56:01.708
Why?

56:01.791 --> 56:03.708
What's so special about her?

56:03.791 --> 56:04.916
[Langerman] Nothing special.

56:05.000 --> 56:08.208
The bank just wants their female
supervisor out of there safely.

56:08.291 --> 56:09.666
[whispers] Standard procedure.

56:09.750 --> 56:10.750
Standard procedure.

56:11.333 --> 56:13.041
Just bring that food and water.

56:15.833 --> 56:17.583
[intense music plays]

56:43.708 --> 56:46.083
[Khumalo] Food and water has arrived.

56:47.166 --> 56:48.666
We're letting you go first.

56:48.750 --> 56:49.791
[Aldo] Get up.

56:52.166 --> 56:53.958
You're doing a good thing, son.

56:54.791 --> 56:58.375
So, the police asked me
to release you specifically, Christine.

56:58.458 --> 56:59.625
Do you know why?

56:59.708 --> 57:00.875
I have no idea.

57:02.458 --> 57:05.583
Okay, well, you are free to go.

57:05.666 --> 57:07.291
I'm not walking out those doors.

57:07.375 --> 57:08.875
[in Afrikaans] What are you doing?

57:08.958 --> 57:12.083
[in English] If she doesn't want to go,
I'll take her place. Pass me my bag.

57:12.166 --> 57:13.291
Sit down!

57:18.833 --> 57:21.750
Christine, I suggest you go
before I change my mind.

57:21.833 --> 57:23.875
I'm not going
to leave these people here.

57:23.958 --> 57:26.375
They're my responsibility.
I can't just abandon them.

57:26.458 --> 57:28.208
You can take Susan in my place.

57:29.541 --> 57:30.458
[gulps]

57:37.625 --> 57:38.708
[Khumalo] Ernie.

57:38.791 --> 57:40.250
Come help me get the food.

57:45.291 --> 57:46.583
Come out.

57:46.666 --> 57:48.375
[in Afrikaans] See you later.

57:48.458 --> 57:50.083
[Langerman, in English] Where's Christine?

57:50.166 --> 57:52.625
-[in Afrikaans] Doesn't wanna come out.
-[in English] Why not?

57:52.708 --> 57:55.666
How am I supposed to know?
Maybe she likes the ambiance in there.

57:55.750 --> 57:59.708
I gave you two hostages, okay.
We need that letter, Captain.

57:59.791 --> 58:01.083
Move it. Hey!

58:03.125 --> 58:05.708
[officer over radio] Charlie one,
we have the hostages. Moving back.

58:05.791 --> 58:07.708
[suspenseful music playing]

58:15.083 --> 58:16.875
[Schoeman] Where's Christine?

58:16.958 --> 58:19.041
[Langerman] She won't come
out of the bank.

58:19.125 --> 58:21.125
[suspenseful music continues]

58:27.458 --> 58:28.625
[man, in Africaans] Thank you.

58:31.416 --> 58:32.875
[woman] Thank you.

58:45.833 --> 58:46.708
[Khumalo] Damn.

58:46.791 --> 58:48.791
[panting]

59:00.500 --> 59:03.083
Captain. What if we use
that old lady over there?

59:04.708 --> 59:05.958
[in Afrikaans] No.

59:06.041 --> 59:07.500
How do you mean "No," Brigadier?

59:07.583 --> 59:09.041
Because I say no.

59:09.583 --> 59:12.791
We could use her to persuade
Christine to come out of the bank.

59:14.375 --> 59:16.625
Let me explain something to you both.

59:16.708 --> 59:19.291
You want us to turn a maid

59:19.375 --> 59:21.958
into a heroine on national television?

59:23.333 --> 59:26.625
How desperate do you want us to look? Hmm?

59:29.625 --> 59:30.833
Fuck.

59:34.833 --> 59:35.750
Fuck.

59:38.541 --> 59:39.583
Captain!

59:40.250 --> 59:42.375
If your plan doesn't work, mine will.

59:42.958 --> 59:45.541
[Aldo in English] Come!
Bathroom break is over.

59:45.625 --> 59:47.625
[breathing heavily]

59:47.708 --> 59:49.708
[suspenseful music playing]

59:55.791 --> 59:56.625
[Johan coughs]

1:00:14.041 --> 1:00:15.958
Uh, my… my shoelaces.

1:00:16.041 --> 1:00:16.916
Hey.

1:00:17.791 --> 1:00:20.291
-Hurry up. Don't have all day.
-[Khumalo coughing]

1:00:29.958 --> 1:00:31.833
-[Johan] Drop it!
-Hey!

1:00:31.916 --> 1:00:33.541
-Drop it!
-[Johan] Drop your guns!

1:00:33.625 --> 1:00:35.375
-Drop your guns!
-Put it down.

1:00:35.458 --> 1:00:37.000
I said drop the guns!

1:00:37.083 --> 1:00:39.500
-Or else I'll kill him. I'll kill him.
-Calm down.

1:00:40.041 --> 1:00:41.333
I will! Drop it!

1:00:41.416 --> 1:00:44.250
-[all shouting]
-Put it down.

1:00:46.666 --> 1:00:48.083
Drop your guns!

1:00:48.166 --> 1:00:49.250
I will kill him!

1:00:49.333 --> 1:00:50.875
Hey, wait!

1:00:51.625 --> 1:00:55.083
-[all shouting]
-Look! Look at me! I'm moving back.

1:00:55.166 --> 1:00:57.000
I'm moving back. I'm putting it down.

1:00:57.083 --> 1:00:59.750
-I will kill him!
-Okay! Okay! Okay!

1:00:59.833 --> 1:01:02.250
-[indistinct shouting]
-Okay! Okay!

1:01:02.333 --> 1:01:04.125
All right, I'm dropping it.

1:01:06.958 --> 1:01:08.250

1:01:10.416 --> 1:01:12.000
[Brigadier, in Afrikaans] Shots. Go!

1:01:12.083 --> 1:01:14.833
-[gun clicks]
-[Johan moans]

1:01:14.916 --> 1:01:16.583
[in English] Terra, wait.

1:01:16.666 --> 1:01:18.208
It's a five shooter. You're out.

1:01:20.125 --> 1:01:21.916
[in Zulu] Khumalo, shoot him, man!

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.041
[in English] The enemy's outside,
not in here. No civilian casualties.

1:01:25.125 --> 1:01:28.416
But if any of you guys try that again,
there will be consequences.

1:01:28.500 --> 1:01:31.791
Do you understand me?
I told you, you stay calm, you go home.

1:01:31.875 --> 1:01:33.958
This is not calm.

1:01:34.625 --> 1:01:35.833
Terra, check on Aldo.

1:01:35.916 --> 1:01:36.958
-Ernie.
-[Ernie] Yeah.

1:01:37.041 --> 1:01:38.375
[Khumalo] Come here.

1:01:38.458 --> 1:01:41.000
Ernie, you just got a promotion.
Go lock up your boss.

1:01:41.083 --> 1:01:42.000
-Okay.
-Chain him there.

1:01:42.083 --> 1:01:43.208
[in Zulu] Get up, dog.

1:01:43.750 --> 1:01:44.875
[in English] Stay calm!

1:01:47.333 --> 1:01:48.500
On the floor.

1:01:51.250 --> 1:01:52.458
[grunts]

1:01:55.416 --> 1:01:57.541
[telephone ringing]

1:01:57.625 --> 1:01:59.083
[in Zulu] Terra, let me have a look…

1:01:59.166 --> 1:02:00.250
I'm all right.

1:02:00.333 --> 1:02:01.375
[in English] Excuse me.

1:02:01.458 --> 1:02:02.708
What?

1:02:02.791 --> 1:02:04.291
Is there any way we can help?

1:02:06.833 --> 1:02:09.583
-I don't know. Do what you can.
-[telephone ringing]

1:02:15.125 --> 1:02:17.916
Calvin, we heard gunshots.
What is happening in there?

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.500
[Khumalo] Nobody is hurt yet, Captain.

1:02:20.208 --> 1:02:21.625
But that could all change.

1:02:21.708 --> 1:02:22.875
You've run out of time.

1:02:22.958 --> 1:02:25.375
Thirty minutes,
I just need 30 more minutes.

1:02:25.458 --> 1:02:27.041
You don't have 30 minutes.

1:02:27.750 --> 1:02:29.250
You have 15 minutes.

1:02:30.458 --> 1:02:31.458
Fifteen.

1:02:35.708 --> 1:02:36.958
[ragged breathing]

1:02:37.583 --> 1:02:38.500
Fifteen.

1:02:47.416 --> 1:02:48.958
[in Afrikaans] Not now, man.

1:02:57.291 --> 1:02:58.958
[Khumalo, in English]
Why didn't you leave?

1:02:59.041 --> 1:03:01.625
You had every opportunity to go,
but you didn't take it.

1:03:01.708 --> 1:03:03.166
I'm just trying to help.

1:03:03.250 --> 1:03:04.083
[scoffs]

1:03:04.708 --> 1:03:05.833
Sure, you are.

1:03:06.958 --> 1:03:08.000
I'm sure.

1:03:16.041 --> 1:03:16.958
Where is she?

1:03:18.833 --> 1:03:20.833
[suspenseful music playing]

1:03:31.875 --> 1:03:34.416
[suspenseful music continues]

1:03:43.583 --> 1:03:44.750
[gasps]

1:03:46.458 --> 1:03:48.458
[inhales sharply]

1:04:08.291 --> 1:04:09.833
[woman grunting]

1:04:10.708 --> 1:04:12.000
[soft thuds]

1:04:14.083 --> 1:04:15.833
[Khumalo] Step away from the door.

1:04:15.916 --> 1:04:17.250
There's no way out.

1:04:17.333 --> 1:04:19.333
[panting]

1:04:20.791 --> 1:04:23.833
This has nothing to do with me.
So I demand to leave right now.

1:04:23.916 --> 1:04:25.708
[Khumalo] You don't get to make demands.

1:04:26.250 --> 1:04:28.375
What's stopping me
from killing you right now?

1:04:28.875 --> 1:04:29.916
What?

1:04:31.166 --> 1:04:34.583
Like you did the pilot in the vault?
Go ahead. Shoot me.

1:04:35.625 --> 1:04:37.625
-Probably had white parents.
-[exhales]

1:04:38.375 --> 1:04:41.750
White friends,
spoke English your whole life.

1:04:41.833 --> 1:04:43.000
How do you even begin--

1:04:43.083 --> 1:04:44.458
It doesn't matter.

1:04:44.541 --> 1:04:46.208
[ragged breathing]

1:04:46.833 --> 1:04:48.000
My point is,

1:04:49.333 --> 1:04:51.125
you can hide behind your history.

1:04:52.375 --> 1:04:55.166
Maybe get away with it
because of how you look.

1:04:57.333 --> 1:04:58.958
Use your privilege…

1:04:59.458 --> 1:05:02.541
and your money to keep up the façade.

1:05:02.625 --> 1:05:05.375
But you can't run
away from who you really are.

1:05:05.458 --> 1:05:07.333
-You don't know me!
-[dramatic sting]

1:05:08.625 --> 1:05:12.833
You think it's easy being me,
looking the way that I do?

1:05:14.833 --> 1:05:18.125
People constantly sniggering
and debating who I am.

1:05:18.666 --> 1:05:20.041
You don't know me.

1:05:21.708 --> 1:05:24.958
And you know nothing
about the choices I've had to make.

1:05:25.541 --> 1:05:26.416
Calvin.

1:05:29.125 --> 1:05:30.125
You're right.

1:05:32.791 --> 1:05:33.833
I don't know you.

1:05:41.083 --> 1:05:42.750
The pilot was self-defense.

1:05:46.375 --> 1:05:47.958
But if the police find out…

1:05:49.125 --> 1:05:50.666
they'll storm the bank.

1:06:04.583 --> 1:06:06.041
[Khumalo] Go join the others.

1:06:07.958 --> 1:06:09.083
[sighs]

1:06:11.875 --> 1:06:15.125
You know, all day I've been thinking
who the informant could be.

1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:20.208
And I just thought maybe Masego.

1:06:21.583 --> 1:06:25.125
This makes me think… maybe Terra.

1:06:30.541 --> 1:06:31.583
No…

1:06:32.541 --> 1:06:33.666
Not Terra.

1:06:36.291 --> 1:06:37.916
She's got a heart of gold.

1:06:42.666 --> 1:06:43.708
Masego…

1:06:48.708 --> 1:06:49.541
[Khumalo] Hmm.

1:06:56.166 --> 1:06:57.375
Let's move.

1:06:59.125 --> 1:07:00.166
I'll do it.

1:07:03.541 --> 1:07:05.708
Uh, Pastor Whatchamacallit…

1:07:05.791 --> 1:07:08.458
No offense, but this ain't for you.

1:07:08.541 --> 1:07:09.958
I beg to differ.

1:07:10.541 --> 1:07:12.541
I want to help too, if you'd allow.

1:07:19.458 --> 1:07:20.291
Um…

1:07:21.041 --> 1:07:23.833
You can put the gun
to my head if that'll help.

1:07:24.333 --> 1:07:26.041
That doesn't seem necessary.

1:07:27.083 --> 1:07:29.625
Do as I say and you'll be safe.

1:07:37.208 --> 1:07:39.333
Why are you doing this again, Calvin?

1:07:39.958 --> 1:07:41.583
Why? Why?!

1:07:42.250 --> 1:07:44.708
What you've asked for
is not easy to deliver.

1:07:44.791 --> 1:07:47.250
-And you know it.
-Maybe you don't understand!

1:07:47.333 --> 1:07:49.625
You have run out of time, Captain.

1:07:50.541 --> 1:07:52.166
What's it gonna take? Huh?

1:07:52.250 --> 1:07:54.375
You know what?
I think I'm done burning money.

1:07:54.458 --> 1:07:56.708
Maybe I should burn this building,
this square,

1:07:56.791 --> 1:07:58.208
or maybe Uncle Paul over there!

1:07:58.291 --> 1:08:01.125
I will burn
this whole country down if it takes it.

1:08:01.208 --> 1:08:02.291
You will release him!

1:08:02.375 --> 1:08:05.125
Why don't you give them what they want?
Let sanity prevail!

1:08:05.208 --> 1:08:07.291
[in Afrikaans] Pastor.
[in English] I'm doing my best.

1:08:07.375 --> 1:08:08.208
Try harder!

1:08:08.291 --> 1:08:11.416
In order for this to work,
I need Calvin to help me.

1:08:11.500 --> 1:08:13.958
You are not a partner.
You're not helping me.

1:08:14.041 --> 1:08:15.500
You're gonna get someone killed.

1:08:15.583 --> 1:08:18.791
Try harder and deliver on your promises.

1:08:18.875 --> 1:08:19.958
Deliver!

1:08:20.583 --> 1:08:21.541
-Ha!
-[Schoeman] Captain!

1:08:21.625 --> 1:08:23.708
-Letter from the prime minister.
-Calvin, wait!

1:08:23.791 --> 1:08:25.083
-Wait!
-[Schoeman] Captain!

1:08:25.166 --> 1:08:27.333
Assuring the release of Mandela.

1:08:30.291 --> 1:08:32.625
Calvin, wait. It's your letter.

1:08:32.708 --> 1:08:35.833
It's a pardon
and a statement of release.

1:08:35.916 --> 1:08:37.583
Signed by the prime minister.

1:08:37.666 --> 1:08:39.666
[suspenseful music playing]

1:08:47.625 --> 1:08:49.625
I'm gonna bring it to you.

1:09:02.791 --> 1:09:04.458
They're going to do it, Calvin.

1:09:05.291 --> 1:09:07.291
They're going to release Mandela.

1:09:07.375 --> 1:09:08.875
This… This is just a letter.

1:09:08.958 --> 1:09:11.625
Okay, well…
when are you actually releasing him?

1:09:11.708 --> 1:09:13.458
Few hours, I'm sure.

1:09:13.541 --> 1:09:15.833
Calvin, wait. Wait. Listen to me.

1:09:16.333 --> 1:09:17.916
In order for this to work,

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.583
I need to come inside
and make sure that all hostages are okay.

1:09:21.666 --> 1:09:23.833
-[scoffs]
-Then they'll release him.

1:09:24.333 --> 1:09:26.208
Please. That's how this works.

1:09:26.791 --> 1:09:28.333
Okay, you decide.

1:09:31.916 --> 1:09:32.833
Aldo!

1:09:39.083 --> 1:09:40.500
Stay back, hey!

1:09:44.208 --> 1:09:46.750
Just so you know, Captain. This?

1:09:47.541 --> 1:09:48.833
This is just a letter.

1:09:49.791 --> 1:09:51.041
You deliver.

1:09:56.458 --> 1:09:57.916
You deliver!

1:09:58.000 --> 1:09:59.041
Deliver!

1:10:00.375 --> 1:10:02.166
[in Zulu] Dog. Ha!

1:10:12.375 --> 1:10:14.708
[Terra]
Khumalo, what does he want in here?

1:10:14.791 --> 1:10:17.375
[in English] We're gonna release Mandela,
Terra. It's okay.

1:10:18.166 --> 1:10:20.250
You get my name out of your mouth.
Hear me?

1:10:21.125 --> 1:10:22.500
[in Zulu] Don't stress, Terra.

1:10:26.916 --> 1:10:27.875
[in English] Hello.

1:10:29.875 --> 1:10:32.083
I'm with the police force.

1:10:32.166 --> 1:10:34.750
I've been asked
to make sure everybody's okay.

1:10:35.708 --> 1:10:38.291
We're working
to get you out of here, okay?

1:10:43.291 --> 1:10:44.375
Christine.

1:10:47.250 --> 1:10:49.625
[in Afrikaans] People outside
are worried about you.

1:10:50.375 --> 1:10:51.916
Come with me, please.

1:10:53.666 --> 1:10:54.541
No.

1:11:00.666 --> 1:11:01.666
[in English] Okay.

1:11:08.375 --> 1:11:11.375
Calvin, please. I need to take the girl.

1:11:11.458 --> 1:11:14.291
It seems she feels safer
in here than out there, Captain.

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.375
And I think you've seen
everything you need to see.

1:11:17.458 --> 1:11:18.458
Leave.

1:11:30.208 --> 1:11:31.083
Wait.

1:11:31.166 --> 1:11:33.166
[suspenseful music playing softly]

1:11:35.208 --> 1:11:36.125
Where is he?

1:11:36.208 --> 1:11:37.208
Where's who?

1:11:37.291 --> 1:11:40.416
The pilot,
Sechaba Maselemola, where is he?

1:11:40.958 --> 1:11:43.708
Know what, Captain?
I think you've overstayed your welcome.

1:11:43.791 --> 1:11:45.916
Leave now.

1:11:46.500 --> 1:11:47.333
Wait.

1:11:48.583 --> 1:11:50.000
Put your leg on the table.

1:11:50.083 --> 1:11:51.583
[in Zulu] Terra, what are you doing?

1:11:52.250 --> 1:11:54.250
[suspenseful music continues]

1:11:54.958 --> 1:11:56.041
[in English] The other one.

1:11:56.958 --> 1:11:58.250
[nervous breathing]

1:12:04.583 --> 1:12:06.416
It's not what it looks like.

1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:09.208
Khumalo, you see. He can't be trusted.

1:12:09.875 --> 1:12:10.958
Get down.

1:12:11.041 --> 1:12:12.708
[shouts] Get down on your knees.

1:12:13.625 --> 1:12:15.000
So many lies.

1:12:15.583 --> 1:12:17.208
Is anything you say true?

1:12:17.291 --> 1:12:18.500
Does this check out?

1:12:18.583 --> 1:12:20.208
-[Langerman] Yes.
-[Khumalo] Does it?

1:12:20.291 --> 1:12:22.208
Calvin, I am not lying to you.

1:12:22.291 --> 1:12:25.458
-[Khumalo] For your sake! It better.
-Please. Please.

1:12:25.541 --> 1:12:26.958
Lower your weapons.

1:12:27.583 --> 1:12:30.291
Calvin, no one needs to get hurt, please.

1:12:31.375 --> 1:12:33.333
Okay, he's right. Okay, okay.

1:12:33.416 --> 1:12:35.541
Let's all calm down. Okay?

1:12:35.625 --> 1:12:37.208
Calm down. I'll put my gun down.

1:12:37.291 --> 1:12:39.875
Aldo, you… you put your gun down.

1:12:39.958 --> 1:12:42.916
Then, Terra? You put your gun down. Okay?

1:12:45.166 --> 1:12:46.333
Terra.

1:12:47.625 --> 1:12:50.125
Terra, I need you to put your gun down.

1:12:50.916 --> 1:12:51.958
Terra.

1:12:54.333 --> 1:12:55.333
Mbali!

1:12:59.708 --> 1:13:01.041
Okay.

1:13:01.875 --> 1:13:02.916
Captain.

1:13:03.666 --> 1:13:05.875
I think you should leave now.
Right now, go.

1:13:07.500 --> 1:13:08.666
Captain Langerman.

1:13:12.041 --> 1:13:13.375
That's your name, right?

1:13:14.666 --> 1:13:15.958
[Langerman] Why?

1:13:16.041 --> 1:13:18.333
[Terra] Your name is Langerman? Yes or no?

1:13:18.958 --> 1:13:20.041
Yes, so?

1:13:22.208 --> 1:13:23.041
[laughs]

1:13:27.333 --> 1:13:28.208
So…

1:13:29.666 --> 1:13:30.958
So…

1:13:31.041 --> 1:13:32.666
Terra, how do you know his name?

1:13:32.750 --> 1:13:35.375
I never told any of you his name,
so how do you know it?

1:13:35.958 --> 1:13:36.833
I don't.

1:13:39.916 --> 1:13:41.458
But Aldo does.

1:13:41.541 --> 1:13:44.166
He mentioned Langerman's name
when none of us knew it.

1:13:44.250 --> 1:13:45.500
Right, Aldo?

1:13:46.375 --> 1:13:48.833
Captain Langerman
will get what he deserves.

1:13:48.916 --> 1:13:50.291
I guarantee it.

1:13:52.416 --> 1:13:53.416
Right, Aldo?

1:13:53.500 --> 1:13:54.958
[sobbing]

1:13:55.041 --> 1:13:55.875
Aldo?

1:13:57.291 --> 1:13:58.375
Aldo, is this true?

1:13:59.666 --> 1:14:01.333
[voice breaks] Is it true, Aldo? Did you…

1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:03.833
[whimpers]

1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:06.375
They got to Khensani.

1:14:08.708 --> 1:14:09.916
Terra, I'm sorry.

1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:11.375
[hostages scream]

1:14:13.708 --> 1:14:15.083
[Khumalo] Aldo!

1:14:15.166 --> 1:14:16.458
Aldo!

1:14:18.833 --> 1:14:20.291
No, Aldo…

1:14:21.958 --> 1:14:23.000
[cries] Terra.

1:14:23.083 --> 1:14:24.625
Terra, what did you do?

1:14:27.541 --> 1:14:29.041
They lied to you.

1:14:29.125 --> 1:14:31.458
[in Zulu] I should shoot you in the head.

1:14:32.333 --> 1:14:33.583
[in English] You lied to him.

1:14:34.583 --> 1:14:36.083
And freeing Mandela?

1:14:38.208 --> 1:14:39.041
This…

1:14:40.166 --> 1:14:41.500
It's a lie too.

1:14:42.875 --> 1:14:44.208
Just leave, okay, leave.

1:14:44.291 --> 1:14:45.333
Leave now!

1:14:45.416 --> 1:14:46.375
Get up.

1:14:47.541 --> 1:14:48.541
Move.

1:14:49.333 --> 1:14:50.333
Move!

1:14:54.875 --> 1:14:56.041
[Khumalo] I'm so sorry.

1:14:57.250 --> 1:14:58.791
I'm so sorry, Aldo.

1:14:59.583 --> 1:15:00.791
I'm sorry.

1:15:10.375 --> 1:15:13.750
-[dramatic music playing]
-[Terra sobs]

1:15:21.041 --> 1:15:22.166
[sobs]

1:15:25.416 --> 1:15:27.041
Why didn't you tell us?

1:15:32.666 --> 1:15:34.291
Why didn't you tell us?

1:15:41.166 --> 1:15:43.833
[Brigadier in Afrikaans]
I agree, Honorable Minister.

1:15:44.708 --> 1:15:45.583
Yes.

1:15:46.458 --> 1:15:47.625
Naturally.

1:15:47.708 --> 1:15:49.791
I will make absolutely sure of it.

1:15:51.291 --> 1:15:53.083
Thank you, Honorable Minister.

1:15:56.625 --> 1:15:58.666
Langerman, Schoeman.

1:16:05.291 --> 1:16:06.541
Get ready to breach.

1:16:06.625 --> 1:16:08.541
What? What about the hostages?

1:16:08.625 --> 1:16:10.458
-No longer important.
-[Langerman] Brigadier…

1:16:11.041 --> 1:16:13.500
One of them just died. They're vulnerable.

1:16:13.583 --> 1:16:15.375
They could surrender, Brigadier.

1:16:15.458 --> 1:16:17.250
[Langerman] We can find
a peaceful solution.

1:16:17.333 --> 1:16:19.583
You think that after
what happened in there

1:16:19.666 --> 1:16:21.125
that you can convince him?

1:16:21.208 --> 1:16:22.875
When I was in the bank

1:16:22.958 --> 1:16:27.125
I saw a man
who wasn't prepared to pull the trigger.

1:16:27.208 --> 1:16:30.708
He could have
kept me hostage but he didn't. Why?

1:16:31.833 --> 1:16:36.208
I think this whole situation,
the violence, the murder

1:16:36.291 --> 1:16:37.791
it's consuming him.

1:16:38.416 --> 1:16:42.916
You want me to believe
that damn terrorist in there

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:44.250
is a good man?

1:16:44.333 --> 1:16:45.375
No.

1:16:46.166 --> 1:16:47.291
What I'm saying

1:16:47.375 --> 1:16:49.291
is that Calvin Khumalo

1:16:49.375 --> 1:16:51.625
is fighting for justice.

1:16:52.333 --> 1:16:54.916
And he doesn't want to lose more people.

1:16:55.916 --> 1:16:57.041
And that's

1:16:58.291 --> 1:16:59.666
your problem.

1:17:01.125 --> 1:17:02.750
You think that trash in there

1:17:03.583 --> 1:17:04.500
are people.

1:17:11.375 --> 1:17:12.458
Out!

1:17:18.083 --> 1:17:21.958
[indistinct voices echo]

1:17:24.083 --> 1:17:26.208
[echoing voices continue]

1:17:27.333 --> 1:17:29.333
[shouts]

1:17:31.583 --> 1:17:32.416
[cries]

1:17:48.541 --> 1:17:50.083
[Christine in English] I have an idea…

1:17:50.166 --> 1:17:51.583
What do you want?

1:17:51.666 --> 1:17:53.541
I don't have anything for you.

1:17:53.625 --> 1:17:56.166
I have police outside.
I've got hostages in there.

1:17:56.250 --> 1:17:57.875
So what do you want?

1:17:58.666 --> 1:18:00.375
I just want a moment alone.

1:18:00.458 --> 1:18:02.125
[cries]

1:18:02.833 --> 1:18:04.958
When I was eight my mother died.

1:18:05.916 --> 1:18:08.958
And a month or so after her death,
Jane came into my life.

1:18:09.041 --> 1:18:11.958
Who's Jane? Who the hell's Jane?
I don't… Can you leave?

1:18:12.041 --> 1:18:13.208
Please just leave!

1:18:13.291 --> 1:18:15.708
She was my nanny,
but so much more than that.

1:18:15.791 --> 1:18:17.833
Listen to me.

1:18:17.916 --> 1:18:23.000
Okay, she taught me
about love for all and equality.

1:18:24.166 --> 1:18:25.958
She said that ubuntu is our duty.

1:18:26.041 --> 1:18:28.791
What do your people know about ubuntu?

1:18:28.875 --> 1:18:30.458
What do you know about humanity?

1:18:30.541 --> 1:18:33.166
[in Zulu] We are only human
through other human beings.

1:18:33.250 --> 1:18:36.125
We are only human
through other human beings.

1:18:37.041 --> 1:18:39.083
[in English] They're just words,
Christine.

1:18:39.166 --> 1:18:40.416
But they're not.

1:18:43.166 --> 1:18:45.458
The Minister of Justice.

1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:48.083
He… He's my--

1:18:48.166 --> 1:18:49.416
He's your father.

1:18:52.333 --> 1:18:54.458
That's why they wanted you out. [laughs]

1:18:54.958 --> 1:18:57.958
I once witnessed
my father take another man's life.

1:18:59.083 --> 1:19:00.750
Killed him like it was nothing.

1:19:01.666 --> 1:19:02.708
And for what?

1:19:03.541 --> 1:19:04.458
Because he was Black?

1:19:04.541 --> 1:19:05.708
So what?

1:19:07.625 --> 1:19:09.166
So what, Christine? Huh?

1:19:10.500 --> 1:19:13.875
He got killed because he was Black.
We get killed because we are Black.

1:19:13.958 --> 1:19:15.666
We're kept poor because we are Black.

1:19:15.750 --> 1:19:17.541
Because I'm Black I'm here.

1:19:17.625 --> 1:19:18.625
So what?

1:19:19.375 --> 1:19:21.291
There's no pain in your privilege.

1:19:22.250 --> 1:19:24.458
My father and the people who work for him,

1:19:25.750 --> 1:19:29.375
they represent everything
that I don't want to become.

1:19:32.875 --> 1:19:34.916
And that's why I'm going to help you.

1:19:40.666 --> 1:19:41.750
How?

1:19:42.666 --> 1:19:44.666
[suspenseful music playing]

1:19:55.000 --> 1:19:56.500
[Langerman] What's going on, Calvin?

1:19:57.375 --> 1:19:58.500
What is this all about?

1:19:58.583 --> 1:20:00.583
She has something to say. So listen.

1:20:00.666 --> 1:20:03.375
Captain, these men are not criminals.

1:20:03.458 --> 1:20:05.208
They didn't come here for the money.

1:20:05.291 --> 1:20:06.750
They came to send a message.

1:20:06.833 --> 1:20:08.666
That all they want is freedom.

1:20:09.250 --> 1:20:10.375
What's wrong with that?

1:20:10.458 --> 1:20:12.291
[in Afrikaans] Think of your family.

1:20:12.875 --> 1:20:15.166
Of your father. Please.

1:20:15.250 --> 1:20:16.166
Father.

1:20:16.250 --> 1:20:17.958
Please, Father, I implore you.

1:20:18.041 --> 1:20:19.500
I know you can see me.

1:20:19.583 --> 1:20:21.000
Do what they ask. Please.

1:20:21.083 --> 1:20:22.375
Do the right thing.

1:20:22.458 --> 1:20:23.750
[Jane] Christina!

1:20:23.833 --> 1:20:25.791
No! What are you doing?

1:20:25.875 --> 1:20:27.083
Don't touch me, you fool.

1:20:27.166 --> 1:20:29.166
[suspenseful music continues]

1:20:41.958 --> 1:20:43.000
Free him!

1:20:43.083 --> 1:20:46.041
-[Khumalo] Free him!
-[Christine] Free Mandela! Free him!

1:20:46.125 --> 1:20:47.416
Free Nelson Mandela!

1:20:47.500 --> 1:20:48.625
[shot fires]

1:20:49.541 --> 1:20:51.000
Cease fire.

1:20:51.083 --> 1:20:53.041
[in Afrikaans] Officers,
come and fetch this woman.

1:20:53.125 --> 1:20:54.666
[Langerman, in English] Cease fire!

1:20:55.250 --> 1:20:57.250
Where did that shot come from?

1:20:57.333 --> 1:20:58.500
Go! Find him.

1:20:58.583 --> 1:20:59.958
[Jane screams] No!

1:21:00.041 --> 1:21:01.875
[Brigadier in Afrikaans] Stand down.

1:21:01.958 --> 1:21:03.041
Stand down.

1:21:04.666 --> 1:21:06.458

1:21:29.958 --> 1:21:32.958
[Khumalo] Get me some towels.
Please, hurry.

1:21:33.041 --> 1:21:34.458
It's okay. Hey!

1:21:35.125 --> 1:21:36.875
-You were brave, okay?
-[gurgles]

1:21:37.375 --> 1:21:39.958
Come on, Christine. Christine.

1:21:40.041 --> 1:21:41.916
-She's gonna be okay.
-[shushes]

1:21:46.083 --> 1:21:48.208
[Ernie sobs] Come on, Christine. Come on.

1:21:48.708 --> 1:21:49.833
It's okay.

1:21:49.916 --> 1:21:51.041
[Khumalo] It's okay, Ernie.

1:21:51.583 --> 1:21:53.041
It's okay, Ernie.

["Hamba Kahle Umkhonto"

1:22:29.708 --> 1:22:31.666
Captain. The sniper.

1:22:34.583 --> 1:22:36.041
Who told you to fire?

1:22:36.125 --> 1:22:37.500
I thought I saw a threat.

1:22:37.583 --> 1:22:40.166
A threat? A white woman, a threat?

1:22:41.041 --> 1:22:43.666
You shot the Minister of Justice's
daughter in public.

1:22:43.750 --> 1:22:45.791
This is going to cost you your career.

1:22:46.333 --> 1:22:48.666

of national security.

[tranquil music playing]

You did the right thing.

[in English] That's the only picture
that I've ever kept.

1:25:04.666 --> 1:25:08.000
Our home was a safe house in Mabopane.

1:25:09.791 --> 1:25:13.791
I grew up seeing strangers
walking in and out of my house

1:25:13.875 --> 1:25:16.750
disguised in makeup. Police raids…

1:25:17.666 --> 1:25:19.458
And when I was a little boy,

1:25:21.291 --> 1:25:22.666
I watched the police

1:25:23.875 --> 1:25:25.708
gun down my parents.

1:25:27.000 --> 1:25:30.791
I watched my parents on their knees

1:25:30.875 --> 1:25:33.166
begging for their lives.

1:25:34.458 --> 1:25:37.333
[sighs] I made a promise to myself.

1:25:39.541 --> 1:25:42.291
That I wouldn't stop until I avenged them.

1:25:47.708 --> 1:25:49.041
And that choice…

1:25:51.375 --> 1:25:53.833
That choice brought me to the MK.

1:25:57.250 --> 1:25:59.083
To the liberation movement.

1:26:05.666 --> 1:26:06.791
It brought me here.

1:26:09.125 --> 1:26:09.958
[laughs]

1:26:13.125 --> 1:26:17.375
So, I actually
lived in Mamelodi with my mother.

1:26:21.541 --> 1:26:25.666
She was doing pretty well
for herself until she had me.

1:26:27.125 --> 1:26:28.666
Then everything changed.

1:26:32.500 --> 1:26:34.708
Kids never wanted to play with me.

1:26:37.666 --> 1:26:39.833
Their parents demonized me.

1:26:42.458 --> 1:26:44.041
They never accepted me.

1:26:47.625 --> 1:26:48.791
So…

1:26:51.541 --> 1:26:55.000
she gave me up for adoption
to her employers.

1:26:56.416 --> 1:26:57.666
The Page family.

1:26:59.750 --> 1:27:01.291
They loved me.

1:27:01.375 --> 1:27:03.458
[telephone ringing]

1:27:03.541 --> 1:27:04.958
They cared for me.

1:27:07.291 --> 1:27:08.458
[telephone ringing]

1:27:08.541 --> 1:27:10.291
But they never understood me.

1:27:12.541 --> 1:27:14.666
They never understood my Blackness.

1:27:49.250 --> 1:27:50.458
Yes.

the SWAT team. It's out of my control.

1:28:03.708 --> 1:28:05.708
[dramatic music playing]

1:28:13.291 --> 1:28:15.083
That's the prime minister's office.
