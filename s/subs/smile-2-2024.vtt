that you look incredible

09:34.661 --> 09:37.707

right here in New York City

09:37.881 --> 09:40.623

an emotional comeback?

09:40.797 --> 09:43.757
Yes, a lot of different
emotions, you know, with
this one.

09:43.931 --> 09:47.108
A year ago, you had
- just won a Grammy.
- Mm-hmm.

09:47.282 --> 09:50.807
You were in the middle
- of a big world tour.
- Mm.

And then you hit
this rough patch.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.986
"Rough patch" might
be generous.

09:56.160 --> 09:58.728

if you could share anything

09:58.902 --> 10:00.861
from that period of your life.

10:01.035 --> 10:04.038
I was dealing with
a lot of stress and pressure

10:04.212 --> 10:05.779
from the demands of the tour.

10:05.953 --> 10:09.217
And I should have
asked for help, but

10:09.391 --> 10:12.916
instead I drowned it all out
with...

10:13.090 --> 10:17.399
drugs and alcohol
and a lot of bad decisions.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.923
And I let myself get
completely out of control.

10:20.097 --> 10:22.970
And actually, I want to
take this opportunity

10:23.144 --> 10:25.625
to apologize to my fans,

10:25.799 --> 10:29.585

and supporting me.

happen again.

15:39.242 --> 15:40.896
It'’s going to be a long day.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.683
Oh, and reminder:
Darius gets in tomorrow.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.990
He'’s gonna be here for opening.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.993
I want him
to feel the love, please.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.387
The label is advancing
a lot of money on this tour.

15:53.561 --> 15:55.606
Have I ever not been
good with Darius?

15:55.780 --> 15:58.566
Darius adores you, obviously.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.308
Just want you to remember
who'’s paying the bill.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.064

What the fuck, Lewis?

17:03.761 --> 17:06.721
- What do you want from me?
- Vicodin! Just Vicodin.

17:06.895 --> 17:10.203
Just for pain,
- same as last time.
- Fuck that!

17:10.377 --> 17:12.901
Skye Riley isn'’t just gonna
suddenly show up here.

17:14.033 --> 17:15.991
Your text
said to come over.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.340

- What? What?

17:20.343 --> 17:22.215
[both breathing shakily]

17:24.304 --> 17:27.176
I don'’t--
I don'’t remember texting that.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.137
How come I don'’t remember
texting that?

17:31.311 --> 17:32.747
- Oh, fuck.
- I don'’t know.

17:32.921 --> 17:34.662
Just get the fuck off me.

17:34.836 --> 17:35.706
Get the fuck off me!

17:35.880 --> 17:38.318
Oh. Oh, shit.

17:38.492 --> 17:40.711
Holy shit, I'’m sorry.
I'’m sorry.

17:44.019 --> 17:47.109
I am having the worst week.

17:53.985 --> 17:55.857
The worst!

17:57.772 --> 18:00.862
Lewis... what was
with the sword?

18:01.776 --> 18:04.039
Uh, what? What sword?

18:04.213 --> 18:05.780
Oh, that sword. [chuckles]

18:05.954 --> 18:09.218
I feel--
I'’m so sorry about that.

18:09.392 --> 18:12.134
I cannot be too careful
right now. Okay?

18:12.308 --> 18:16.486
I am in the middle of some
genuinely fucking freaky shit.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.836
Okay? I'’m talking like
fucking scary,

18:19.010 --> 18:21.056

18:24.625 --> 18:25.626
Yo...

18:26.931 --> 18:30.021
do you believe in, like,
weird stuff?

18:31.240 --> 18:34.504
- Yeah, I'’m gonna go.
- What? No, no, no!

18:34.678 --> 18:38.117
No, please stay.
Please stay. What am I doing?
What am I doing?

18:38.291 --> 18:41.032
Skye fucking Riley'’s here
and Lewis is being fucking
crazy? [giggles]

18:41.207 --> 18:44.775
I am so stoked to see you.
I am pumped. Come on. Come in.

18:44.949 --> 18:48.344
I will chill. Be my guest.
Please take a seat.

18:48.518 --> 18:50.999
Make yourself at home.
I'’m sorry about the mess.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.044
You said you, uh, wanted...
what was it?

18:53.219 --> 18:55.134
You want Vicodin? Right?

18:55.308 --> 18:57.353
- Yeah.
- I got you. I got you.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.268
Want anything else?
I got banger ketamine.

18:59.442 --> 19:02.837
I got really good
fucking Molly. I got some...

19:03.011 --> 19:06.232
- I don'’t know what this is.
- No, dude, just the
Vicodin for my back.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.061
Oh, right, your back.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.934
Ouch. That sucks.
I hate that.

19:13.108 --> 19:15.719
Okay, well, you chill,
and I'’ll be right back.

19:15.893 --> 19:18.940
You chill and I'’ll be
right back, okay? [chuckles]

19:19.114 --> 19:20.898
I'’ll be right back. Mmm.
[sniffs deeply]

19:21.072 --> 19:23.205

- You smell good.

19:23.379 --> 19:26.469

- Are you okay?

It'’s really important for you

28:23.353 --> 28:24.920
to stay on top of
your sleep schedule.

someone around to help
out with things again.

Have you talked to Gemma
about coming on tour?

Gemma is not gonna want
to hear from me, Mom.

- Have you reached out?
- No, not exactly.

28:36.366 --> 28:38.542
She'’s your best friend. I'’m
sure she'’d be willing to forgive

28:38.717 --> 28:41.371
whatever it was that happened
between the two of you.

28:41.545 --> 28:45.375
You'’re a completely different

- Can you please leave it alone?

All I'’m saying is real friends
are hard to come by.

28:49.205 --> 28:51.512
And it was really good for you
when Gemma was around.

I'’d be more than happy to help
out with any personal stuff

Skye might need.
Do you want--

28:56.822 --> 28:58.954
- I don'’t want that.
- You need to stay hydrated.

Will you just stop?

to my favorite rock star.

Oh, my God. I am so excited.

29:26.634 --> 29:29.376
I have a little favor
- to ask of you.
- Sure.

Tomorrow night,
there'’s a fundraising dinner
for Music Inspires Hope.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.947
It'’s a foundation
for underprivileged youth.

29:35.121 --> 29:37.601
Interscope Records has done a
- lot of work with the foundation.
- Wow.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.387
I know this is last-minute,
but I was hoping you'’d
be willing

29:40.561 --> 29:43.564
- to be a special presenter.
- Oh!

29:43.738 --> 29:46.262
I know you'’ve got
a lot on your plate, but
there'’s no arrival carpet,

29:46.436 --> 29:48.656
no press. None of that
annoying stuff.

29:48.830 --> 29:50.614
It'’s purely about the kids.[mouthing] Yes.

30:15.683 --> 30:17.250

33:31.574 --> 33:33.533
We were knocking.
You weren'’t answering.

33:33.707 --> 33:36.275
Why were you screaming?

33:36.449 --> 33:39.800

- Sorry, there'’s
a spider in here?

33:39.974 --> 33:44.413
Tanya says there'’s some
wardrobe issue that you
needed me to look at.

33:44.587 --> 33:47.373
Yeah, I'’m not wearing this one.

33:47.547 --> 33:49.505
I love it. What--
What'’s wrong with it?

33:49.679 --> 33:51.072
Can you show her, please?

33:54.380 --> 33:57.600
The lighting'’s gonna show
- right through this onstage.
- And?

33:57.774 --> 34:00.038
I'’m not trying to show everyone
how fucking disgusting I am.

34:01.561 --> 34:03.780
I think you'’re overreacting
a little bit.

34:03.954 --> 34:06.653
Yeah, Skye, you know what?
I think your scar is badass.

34:06.827 --> 34:08.350
- [Elizabeth] It is badass.
- Seriously.

34:08.524 --> 34:10.222
This is honestly
one of your best looks.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.335

35:21.031 --> 35:22.555
Can we do matching poses?

35:22.729 --> 35:24.034
Of course.
What are you thinking?

35:24.209 --> 35:26.124
Um, like...

35:26.298 --> 35:28.691
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

[camera shutter clicks]
Twinsies. Super cute.

35:31.041 --> 35:33.218
Thank you.
Thanks for coming out.

35:33.392 --> 35:34.523
- Thank you.
- Who'’s next?

35:36.003 --> 35:37.439
"Too Much For One Heart"
got me through

35:37.613 --> 35:39.659

from like a bench press...

about this?

this business is really hard.

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:07.779

of your life chasing success

01:08:07.953 --> 01:08:10.434
you know, thinking that
when it comes,

01:08:10.608 --> 01:08:14.438
it will magically fix,
you know, everything

01:08:15.482 --> 01:08:18.181
that'’s bad and wrong about you.

01:08:18.355 --> 01:08:21.009
And then you achieve success,
and you realize that
it can'’t fix

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:23.751
the deeply broken person
that you have always been.

01:08:23.925 --> 01:08:26.885
And now you can'’t escape

01:08:27.059 --> 01:08:29.844
the miserable thing
that you'’ve become,

01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:31.411
and one day, you realize

01:08:31.585 --> 01:08:33.021
how badly you wish you could

01:08:33.196 --> 01:08:34.719
just trade it all just for

01:08:34.893 --> 01:08:36.068
one fucking moment of happiness!

01:08:36.242 --> 01:08:37.113
[clears throat]

01:08:46.426 --> 01:08:48.385
Oh. [chuckles]

01:08:48.559 --> 01:08:49.908
Sorry about that. Uh...

01:08:50.082 --> 01:08:51.301
[inhales sharply]

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.481
What I meant to say is:

01:08:57.655 --> 01:09:01.137
I hope the next generation
of young artists

01:09:01.311 --> 01:09:04.488
finds themselves
truly inspired tonight.

01:09:04.662 --> 01:09:07.012
I know I sure am.

01:09:09.101 --> 01:09:12.365
And without any further ado,

01:09:12.539 --> 01:09:14.759
I'’d like to introduce
our next guest,

01:09:14.933 --> 01:09:16.674
a very special person

01:09:16.848 --> 01:09:19.285
who surely needs
no introduction:

01:09:20.112 --> 01:09:21.069
Paul Hudson.

01:09:21.244 --> 01:09:22.593
[murmuring]

01:09:23.898 --> 01:09:24.943
What?

01:09:26.423 --> 01:09:28.164
Why does it say that?
That'’s not--

01:09:29.730 --> 01:09:30.818
This-- No. Why did s--

01:09:32.951 --> 01:09:33.952
This-- Why did--

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:37.434
What?[murmuring continues]

01:09:45.268 --> 01:09:46.443
No.

01:09:48.706 --> 01:09:49.750
No.

01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:54.755
No.

01:09:54.929 --> 01:09:56.148
No, stay away from me.

01:09:56.322 --> 01:09:58.281
Stay away from me!

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:00.848
Paul'’s dead!

01:10:01.022 --> 01:10:02.633
You'’re not Paul!

01:10:02.807 --> 01:10:05.201
Stop smiling at me!

01:10:08.595 --> 01:10:09.553
No, no.

01:10:09.727 --> 01:10:11.555
[groaning]

01:10:12.860 --> 01:10:14.862
I can hold it. No, no, stop.

01:10:24.307 --> 01:10:25.308
[stammers]

01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:44.109
[screams]

01:10:44.283 --> 01:10:46.198
[screams][clamoring]

01:11:11.441 --> 01:11:14.052
[no audible dialogue]

01:11:59.663 --> 01:12:01.317
[message alert]

01:12:16.636 --> 01:12:18.159
[message alert]

01:12:27.821 --> 01:12:28.822
Okay.

01:12:33.566 --> 01:12:34.567
[message alert]

01:12:45.273 --> 01:12:47.363
[Lewis breathing shakily]

01:13:06.991 --> 01:13:10.168
[door creaks]

01:13:16.043 --> 01:13:17.828
[continues breathing shakily]

01:13:39.676 --> 01:13:43.723
[whispers] <i>Okay.
Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

01:13:43.897 --> 01:13:47.423
[sniffing, breathing shakily]

01:14:12.883 --> 01:14:14.232
[whispering] <i>Do you see it?</i>

01:14:22.893 --> 01:14:24.938
<i>It just stares at me,</i>

01:14:25.112 --> 01:14:26.810
<i>smiling.</i>

01:14:29.247 --> 01:14:31.249
Skye![screams]

01:15:17.469 --> 01:15:18.775
[elevator dings]

01:15:27.827 --> 01:15:29.612
[phone ringing]

01:15:39.273 --> 01:15:41.406
[rock music playing][indistinct chatter]

01:16:11.088 --> 01:16:13.394
Thank you for agreeing to see--
Wait, what are you doing?

01:16:13.569 --> 01:16:16.746
Sending a photo of you to my
friend in case you'’re some
kind of creep.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:18.443
What? I'’m not a creep.

01:16:18.617 --> 01:16:20.576
Yeah, that'’s what
every creep says.

01:16:24.057 --> 01:16:26.233
Look, I realize
you'’re super famous,

01:16:26.407 --> 01:16:29.280
and I invaded your
privacy. I apologize.

01:16:29.454 --> 01:16:31.195
This is also
very weird for me.

01:16:31.369 --> 01:16:32.762
- How do you know Lewis?
- I don'’t.

01:16:32.936 --> 01:16:35.199
I-- I didn'’t.
[clears throat]

01:16:35.373 --> 01:16:37.375
I was trying to
contact Lewis to warn him.

01:16:37.549 --> 01:16:39.507
Tracked down his address
and went to his apartment.

01:16:39.682 --> 01:16:41.858
The front door was unlocked,
and he was already dead inside.

01:16:42.032 --> 01:16:44.556
I checked his phone,
and you were the last
person he texted with.

01:16:44.730 --> 01:16:47.733
W-What were you trying
to warn him about?

01:16:47.907 --> 01:16:51.345
I'’m aware that what
I'’m about to say is going
to sound completely insane,

01:16:51.519 --> 01:16:53.783
but Lewis didn'’t kill himself.

01:16:53.957 --> 01:16:58.309
He was systematically infected,
possessed and then murdered

01:16:58.483 --> 01:17:01.007
by some kind
of metaphysical being.

01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:03.314
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:17:03.488 --> 01:17:08.145
If it helps, you might call it
a-- a spirit or a demon.

01:17:08.319 --> 01:17:11.061
Maybe. I have no clue
what this thing is!

01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:13.193
But it disguises itself

01:17:13.367 --> 01:17:16.936
to look like people.
Like smiling people.

01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:19.896
But only the person that'’s
been infected by it can see it.

01:17:20.070 --> 01:17:22.986
No, that'’s--
that'’s not real. That'’s
some supernatural bullshit.

01:17:23.160 --> 01:17:25.466
But you'’ve seen it,
haven'’t you?

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.555
That'’s why you'’re still
sitting here.

01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:28.861
[phone buzzing]

01:17:31.211 --> 01:17:33.649
[sighs] I--

01:17:33.823 --> 01:17:35.520
I don'’t know.
I don'’t know what'’s happening.

01:17:35.694 --> 01:17:37.870
I feel like I'’m losing
my goddamn mind!

01:17:38.044 --> 01:17:40.090
That'’s precisely
what this thing does to you.
It'’s what it did to Lewis

01:17:40.264 --> 01:17:42.483
while it was latched onto him.
It'’s like a parasite

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.442
that infects the host
through their mind.

01:17:44.616 --> 01:17:47.227
In less than a week,
it drives the host insane.

01:17:47.401 --> 01:17:49.926
It'’s like it feeds off
all the bad shit in their head,

01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.319
and then
once it'’s done feeding,

01:17:52.493 --> 01:17:55.192
it forces the host to kill
themself in front of a witness.

01:17:55.366 --> 01:17:57.716
And then that witness
becomes the new host.

01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:59.370
That'’s how you got it
from Lewis.

01:17:59.544 --> 01:18:02.112
It was passed to Lewis
by a cop in Jersey.

01:18:02.286 --> 01:18:03.722
That cop was the first one
I tried to contact,

01:18:03.896 --> 01:18:05.724
but I guess he went
off the grid.

01:18:05.898 --> 01:18:07.465
That cop caught it
from some doctor, who got it

01:18:07.639 --> 01:18:09.075
from a patient, who got it
from a college professor.

01:18:09.249 --> 01:18:10.903
And the chain
keeps going back.

01:18:11.077 --> 01:18:12.862
I'’ve documented all of this.
I can show you.

01:18:13.036 --> 01:18:14.298
Why do you even know
all of this?

01:18:14.472 --> 01:18:16.692
Because it killed my brother.

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.825
My brother was a host

01:18:19.999 --> 01:18:23.002
eight people before you.

01:18:23.176 --> 01:18:25.178
He tried to tell me
what was happening to him.

01:18:25.352 --> 01:18:27.050
But he made it hard
to trust him,

01:18:27.224 --> 01:18:28.399
and the stuff he was saying

01:18:29.313 --> 01:18:32.316
sounded certifiably crazy.

01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:36.407
He begged me for help.
But I didn'’t listen.

01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:38.801
And then a few days later...
[inhales sharply]

01:18:38.975 --> 01:18:40.541
...I got a call informing me

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.935
that he tore his own jaw off
with a crowbar.

01:18:49.115 --> 01:18:51.422
Well, have you gone
to the police?[chuckling] And say what?

01:18:51.596 --> 01:18:53.729
My brother'’s suicide
was actually caused

01:18:53.903 --> 01:18:57.123
by some cosmic evil being
that no one else can see?

01:18:57.297 --> 01:18:59.169
The police can'’t
stop this thing anyway.

01:18:59.343 --> 01:19:01.127
So I'’m just supposed to wait
until this thing kills me?

01:19:01.301 --> 01:19:02.520
No, I want you

01:19:02.694 --> 01:19:05.001
- to help me destroy it.
- How?

01:19:05.175 --> 01:19:08.395
From what I can tell,
the chain stops

01:19:08.569 --> 01:19:12.051
when an infected host dies
in some other way

01:19:12.225 --> 01:19:14.184
outside of the being'’s control.

01:19:14.358 --> 01:19:17.317
My guess is that,
just like other parasites,

01:19:17.491 --> 01:19:18.623
without a living host

01:19:18.797 --> 01:19:20.364
it has no way to survive.

01:19:20.538 --> 01:19:22.888
It ceases to exist.

01:19:23.062 --> 01:19:24.629
So it only stops if--

01:19:24.803 --> 01:19:26.283
if I die before it kills me?

01:19:26.457 --> 01:19:28.154
Exactly. We need
to kill you first.

01:19:28.328 --> 01:19:29.852
What?

01:19:30.026 --> 01:19:32.768
Only technically. Look.

01:19:32.942 --> 01:19:36.336
There are ways that we can
very safely stop your heart.

01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:39.035
That'’ll deprive it
of a living host.

01:19:39.209 --> 01:19:40.906
Once it goes,

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.952
I can resuscitate your heart
and bring you back.

01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:44.867
Are you
out of your fucking mind?

01:19:45.041 --> 01:19:46.346
I know it seems extreme.

01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:47.957
"Extreme"?
You'’re asking to kill me!

01:19:48.131 --> 01:19:50.089
Whoa, hey. Just keep it down.

01:19:50.263 --> 01:19:52.178
I don'’t even know you.
I don'’t even know you!

01:19:52.352 --> 01:19:54.354
My name is Morris.
I'’m an ER nurse,

01:19:54.528 --> 01:19:56.530
and if we don'’t do this,
it'’s gonna kill you

01:19:56.704 --> 01:19:58.750
like it killed Lewis
and infect another victim.

01:19:58.924 --> 01:20:00.883
Look, I'’ve already got
everything prepared.

01:20:01.057 --> 01:20:03.102
We should just go now and
get rid of this thing tonight.

01:20:04.930 --> 01:20:08.499
- I can'’t. I can'’t do this.
- You'’re nearly out of time!

01:20:08.673 --> 01:20:11.110
This thing has been feeding
on you for three days already!

01:20:11.284 --> 01:20:13.939
It'’s already taking control
of your brain, and pretty soon

01:20:14.113 --> 01:20:16.333
you won'’t even realize
the ways it'’s manipulating you,

01:20:16.507 --> 01:20:19.510
and then it'’ll be too late
to stop it. We have to go
right now.

01:20:19.684 --> 01:20:22.165
[onlooker] Is that Skye Riley?[drunk person 1]
Holy shit. Dude.

01:20:22.339 --> 01:20:24.645
That'’s Skye?[onlooker 2] It'’s Skye Riley!

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.779
Would you do a quick
- TikTok with us?
- Skye Riley!

01:20:27.953 --> 01:20:31.261
I watched that video
where you knocked down that
old lady like fifty times!

01:20:31.435 --> 01:20:33.045
That shit was so fucking funny.

01:20:33.219 --> 01:20:35.569

What?

01:27:28.112 --> 01:27:29.244
- [Paul] What?
- What?

01:27:30.767 --> 01:27:32.682
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:36.555
Are you crying right now?

01:27:36.729 --> 01:27:39.166
I'’m-- I'’m not crying. [sniffs][laughs]

01:27:39.341 --> 01:27:40.994
Are you crying?

01:27:41.604 --> 01:27:43.083
[sniffs]

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:45.303
Hmm? Huh?[clears throat]

01:27:45.477 --> 01:27:48.611
Hey! Hey, I'’m fucking
talking to you!

01:27:50.613 --> 01:27:52.267
["Boss" playing loudly
on radio]

01:27:53.746 --> 01:27:55.052
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:27:55.226 --> 01:27:56.445
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:27:56.619 --> 01:27:57.881
What the fuck is wrong with me?

01:27:58.055 --> 01:27:59.709
What the fuck
is wrong with you, huh?

01:27:59.883 --> 01:28:01.580
I don'’t know! I don'’t know!

01:28:01.754 --> 01:28:03.234
I don'’t know, Paul.
Why don'’t you tell me,

01:28:03.408 --> 01:28:05.062
since I can'’t
do anything right?

01:28:05.236 --> 01:28:07.630
Jesus Christ! I swear--

01:28:07.804 --> 01:28:10.197
I swear to fucking God,
you are so--

01:28:10.372 --> 01:28:11.938
What? What? What?

01:28:12.112 --> 01:28:15.072
I'’m so fucking what?
Say it. What am I?

01:28:15.246 --> 01:28:17.727
Tell me, I am so fucking...

01:28:18.728 --> 01:28:20.643
You'’re fucking psycho!

01:28:20.817 --> 01:28:22.427
- Oh, yay!
- Yeah!

01:28:22.601 --> 01:28:25.082
- Psycho!
- It'’s out of the bag!

01:28:25.256 --> 01:28:26.997
You'’re fucking crazy![cheers]

01:28:27.171 --> 01:28:28.781
I'’ll show you crazy!

01:28:28.955 --> 01:28:30.957
- You want to fucking see crazy?
- Stop it! Stop it!

01:28:31.131 --> 01:28:32.916
- What are you doing?
- Is that crazy enough for you?

01:28:33.090 --> 01:28:35.614
- Is that fucked up? Huh?
- Stop it!

01:28:35.788 --> 01:28:37.573
- Is that crazy enough for you?
- Yes, that is crazy,

01:28:37.747 --> 01:28:39.923
you fucking psycho!

01:28:40.097 --> 01:28:43.230
Jesus fucking Christ!
I'’m fucking driving.

01:28:43.405 --> 01:28:47.104
- [grunts] Fucking hate you!
- Good! Good!

01:28:47.278 --> 01:28:50.803
'’Cause I fucking hate you, too.
I fucking-- [sighs]

01:28:52.065 --> 01:28:53.589
You crazy bitch.

01:28:53.763 --> 01:28:55.591
[cackling]

01:28:56.766 --> 01:28:59.595
Ah, you psycho bitch!

01:29:01.814 --> 01:29:04.469
[mock crying]
Oh, you'’re gonna cry.

01:29:04.643 --> 01:29:07.994
Are you gonna cry now?
Is that your thing? "Oh, God!"

01:29:08.168 --> 01:29:12.042
Oh, you look so fucking ugly
when you cry. It'’s horrible.

01:29:12.216 --> 01:29:15.350
I can'’t-- Ew, I can'’t--
[mock gags]

01:29:17.264 --> 01:29:21.007
"Oh, help me, God!"

01:29:21.181 --> 01:29:22.792
[mock sobbing]

01:29:24.707 --> 01:29:26.883
[screams]
What the fuck are you doing?

01:29:27.057 --> 01:29:28.493
What are you doing?

01:29:28.667 --> 01:29:32.758
[horn blares][Paul] Jesus! Oh, my God!

01:29:32.932 --> 01:29:34.760
[metal crunches][gasps]

01:29:36.893 --> 01:29:40.375
It'’s okay, it'’s okay.
Everything'’s fine. Hey, hey.

01:29:41.637 --> 01:29:42.638
You'’re okay.

01:29:43.987 --> 01:29:45.858
You have a mild concussion.

01:29:53.605 --> 01:29:55.302
Where am I? Where am I?

01:29:55.477 --> 01:29:58.218
Harvest Moon.
It'’s a private wellness clinic.

01:29:58.393 --> 01:30:00.569
You fainted and hit your head.

01:30:00.743 --> 01:30:04.050
We found you lying
on your living room floor,

01:30:04.224 --> 01:30:05.704
unconscious.

01:30:05.878 --> 01:30:07.619
The doctor said
you were sleep deprived

01:30:07.793 --> 01:30:09.752
and extremely dehydrated.

01:30:09.926 --> 01:30:12.189
No, no, no, that'’s not--

01:30:12.363 --> 01:30:13.843
That'’s not--
That'’s not what happened.

01:30:14.017 --> 01:30:15.932
Joshua, could you go
find Dr. Fowler

01:30:16.106 --> 01:30:18.500
- and let him know Skye'’s awake?
- Of course, yeah.

01:30:18.674 --> 01:30:21.241
I hope you'’re
feeling better, Skye.

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:25.420
I, uh... I brought a sweatshirt
for you, just in case you...

01:30:26.638 --> 01:30:27.987
...you get cold.

01:30:43.394 --> 01:30:46.005
[Elizabeth]
We can cover that with makeup.

01:30:46.179 --> 01:30:49.139
And the team'’s already working
on a fill piece for your hair.

01:30:54.100 --> 01:30:56.538
Don'’t worry, you won'’t be able
to tell the difference.

01:30:57.843 --> 01:30:59.976
And I'’ve cleared your schedule.

01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:02.326
So today you can
just have a whole day

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.589
of rest and recuperation.

01:31:04.763 --> 01:31:07.505
[Skye whimpering]
Where'’s my phone?

01:31:07.679 --> 01:31:08.854
- I need my phone.
- It'’s right here.

01:31:09.028 --> 01:31:10.508
I got it.

01:31:10.682 --> 01:31:13.163
- I need it. Give it to me.
- Maybe later.

01:31:13.337 --> 01:31:16.732
Right now, we'’re just
gonna focus on relaxing.

01:31:16.906 --> 01:31:20.344
[whispering] Mom.
Please, please.

01:31:20.518 --> 01:31:22.215
Something really crazy
is happening to me.

01:31:22.389 --> 01:31:23.869
I need to get out of here
right now.

01:31:24.043 --> 01:31:27.525
No. We are gonna
stay here together

01:31:27.699 --> 01:31:30.615
until we head to the venue
tomorrow for the preshow.

01:31:30.789 --> 01:31:32.878
That way we can make sure
you'’re a hundred percent

01:31:33.052 --> 01:31:34.793
and ready to perform.

01:31:34.967 --> 01:31:36.491
No, no. I can'’t. I--

01:31:36.665 --> 01:31:38.014
Can'’t what?

01:31:38.971 --> 01:31:40.059
[breathes shakily]

01:31:41.844 --> 01:31:43.323
I can'’t do the show.

01:31:45.282 --> 01:31:49.634
If you... cancel the show,
then you will be

01:31:49.808 --> 01:31:52.985
checking yourself into
a recovery program.

01:31:53.159 --> 01:31:55.727
That'’s the only
explanation... Mom--

01:31:55.901 --> 01:31:58.121
...as to why Skye Riley
is canceling another tour

01:31:58.295 --> 01:31:59.470
the night before it starts.

01:31:59.644 --> 01:32:01.472
You will have to explain
to the label

01:32:01.646 --> 01:32:03.605
who'’ve invested
millions of dollars.

01:32:03.779 --> 01:32:06.172
And you'’re putting the workers--Mom, you don'’t understand!

01:32:06.346 --> 01:32:09.306
No! You don'’t
understand, Skye.

01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.743
There are
no more second chances.

01:32:11.917 --> 01:32:15.007
If you cancel, this is it.

01:32:15.181 --> 01:32:17.967
The media will rake you
over the coals.

01:32:18.141 --> 01:32:20.230
We'’ll be sued
by the label for millions.

01:32:20.404 --> 01:32:23.973
It will be the end
of everything we'’ve built.

01:32:25.322 --> 01:32:26.976
[sobbing] Oh, my God, Mom.

01:32:27.150 --> 01:32:29.544
Why is that
all you care about, Mom?

01:32:29.718 --> 01:32:32.938
You treat me like
I'’m some fucking windup toy.

01:32:33.112 --> 01:32:34.505
You don'’t give a shit about me!

01:32:34.679 --> 01:32:36.768
How dare you
talk to me like that?

01:32:36.942 --> 01:32:38.248
You arrogant little asshole!

01:32:38.422 --> 01:32:40.642
I have given up
everything for you!

01:32:40.816 --> 01:32:42.513
Every second of my time.

01:32:42.687 --> 01:32:44.297
Years of my life.

01:32:45.255 --> 01:32:47.997
My career.
And here I am,

01:32:48.171 --> 01:32:53.002
sacrificing every fiber
of my being to support you.

01:32:53.176 --> 01:32:56.005
But you'’re too selfish
to even see it.

01:32:56.179 --> 01:32:59.835
You put everyone
through absolute hell,

01:33:00.009 --> 01:33:02.620
and still we support you.

01:33:02.794 --> 01:33:05.667
But you want to go
and throw it away? Fine!

01:33:05.841 --> 01:33:08.408
Do it! Throw it away!
I don'’t care!

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:10.976
That'’s what everyone expects
of you anyway.

01:33:13.762 --> 01:33:16.416
I wish you could feel
what it'’s like

01:33:16.591 --> 01:33:18.723
having to live inside my head.

01:33:23.032 --> 01:33:24.990
[in demonic voice] I'’ve tasted
what'’s inside your head!

01:33:25.164 --> 01:33:26.905
[sobbing] No, no, please, no!

01:33:27.079 --> 01:33:29.038
Please, no.

01:33:29.212 --> 01:33:30.256
No.

01:33:34.173 --> 01:33:36.654
No, no, no! Please!

01:33:36.828 --> 01:33:38.221
No!

01:33:38.395 --> 01:33:39.614
[grunting]

01:33:42.051 --> 01:33:43.879
Oh, no, no!

01:33:44.053 --> 01:33:45.445
[breathes heavily]

01:33:46.403 --> 01:33:48.623
[grunting]

01:33:56.456 --> 01:33:59.938
Look what you'’re doing
to your poor mother.

01:34:00.112 --> 01:34:02.245
[Skye crying]

01:34:02.419 --> 01:34:03.550
No, God!

01:34:05.988 --> 01:34:07.293
[groans]

01:34:27.836 --> 01:34:29.185
[breathes shakily]

01:34:48.595 --> 01:34:49.640
[gasps]

01:35:17.581 --> 01:35:19.322
[Elizabeth choking]

01:35:24.283 --> 01:35:26.285
[whispering]
Oh, God, that'’s not real.

01:35:26.459 --> 01:35:29.114
It'’s not real. It'’s not real.

01:35:29.288 --> 01:35:30.637
It'’s not real.

01:35:31.334 --> 01:35:32.596
No, no.

01:35:32.770 --> 01:35:34.076
[screams] No!

01:35:35.991 --> 01:35:39.211
It'’s not real, it'’s not real,
it'’s not real. [inhales deeply]

01:35:41.997 --> 01:35:43.476
[gasping]

01:35:49.265 --> 01:35:50.745
[shakily] Oh...

01:35:52.224 --> 01:35:53.225
Oh!

01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:57.099
[gasps, sobs]

01:36:10.112 --> 01:36:11.766
[knocking on door][gasps]

01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:13.593
It'’s Joshua!

01:36:17.293 --> 01:36:19.338
[door opening]
I need a second!

01:36:19.512 --> 01:36:22.080
I'’m changing.[Joshua] Oh! Sorry! Uh...

01:36:22.254 --> 01:36:24.213
You know what?
I'’ll wait out here.

01:36:24.387 --> 01:36:26.084
Also, the doctor said
he'’s gonna come and see you

01:36:26.258 --> 01:36:27.172
in a few minutes.

01:36:27.346 --> 01:36:29.435
Actually, I...

01:36:29.609 --> 01:36:32.699
I... I feel kind of thirsty.
I need a--

01:36:32.874 --> 01:36:34.789
Do you think you could go
find me something to drink?

01:36:34.963 --> 01:36:37.139
Oh. Uh, I brought
some bottles of water.

01:36:37.313 --> 01:36:39.445
Put them
in the little refrigerator.

01:36:39.619 --> 01:36:41.926
I feel like soda. Could you
get me a soda, please?

01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:43.798
Sure. Yeah, no problem.

01:36:45.364 --> 01:36:46.757
What kind?

01:36:46.931 --> 01:36:49.455
Any kind, just... surprise me.

01:36:49.629 --> 01:36:51.980
You got it. You know what?
I'’ll be right back

01:36:52.154 --> 01:36:54.896
with one, uh...
surprising soda.

01:37:14.567 --> 01:37:16.569
[breathing heavily]

01:37:23.185 --> 01:37:24.969
[shakily] Fuck.

01:37:25.143 --> 01:37:28.843
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Oh, fuck!

01:37:34.022 --> 01:37:37.025
Fuck. Oh, fuck.

01:37:46.338 --> 01:37:47.687
Shit.

01:38:25.029 --> 01:38:26.291
[exhales shakily]

01:38:42.307 --> 01:38:44.135
[indistinct chatter]

01:39:16.211 --> 01:39:17.952
[chattering]

01:39:24.436 --> 01:39:25.524
[Joshua] Skye?

01:39:27.526 --> 01:39:28.701
Are you--

01:39:28.875 --> 01:39:31.182
Oh, my God! Is that...

01:39:32.270 --> 01:39:33.358
blood?

01:39:37.841 --> 01:39:38.885
No.

01:39:40.713 --> 01:39:43.586
[shakily] Hey, uh...
We need a doctor over here!

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:45.892
- [whispering] Shut the fuck up!
- Yeah, could we please

01:39:46.067 --> 01:39:47.677
get some help, somebody?

01:39:47.851 --> 01:39:50.506
- Just shut the fuck up!
- Are you hurt?

01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:52.073
[Joshua] Somebody please help!
We need a doctor.

01:39:52.247 --> 01:39:53.813
Oh, my God, Skye.

01:39:54.901 --> 01:39:56.816
Hey... you, you, you!

01:39:56.991 --> 01:39:58.166
Please help me!

01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:00.168
[guard] Whoa, whoa, easy!
I got you.

01:40:00.342 --> 01:40:01.473
Get away from me!

01:40:01.647 --> 01:40:02.779
[all gasping]

01:40:05.608 --> 01:40:08.567
Hey... just take it easy.[all screaming]

01:40:08.741 --> 01:40:11.657
I said get the fuck
away from me!

01:40:11.831 --> 01:40:13.746
[breathes heavily]

01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:15.705
I'’m sorry. I'’m sorry.

01:40:15.879 --> 01:40:17.011
Skye?

01:40:17.924 --> 01:40:20.014
Skye? What are you doing?

01:40:20.188 --> 01:40:22.233
Think about the tour.

01:40:23.887 --> 01:40:26.237
Fuck the tour!

01:40:29.980 --> 01:40:31.242
[indistinct chatter]

01:40:34.637 --> 01:40:35.986
[person 1] Is that Skye Riley?

01:40:38.162 --> 01:40:40.469
[bystanders chattering][train passing]

01:40:47.084 --> 01:40:49.565
[glass breaks]
Fuck! Fuck!

01:40:50.479 --> 01:40:53.395
Fuck! Oh, God.

01:40:53.569 --> 01:40:54.700
[Gemma] Skye?

01:40:54.874 --> 01:40:56.789
What are you doing out here?

01:40:56.963 --> 01:40:58.313
Gemma, what are you doing here?

01:40:58.487 --> 01:41:00.402
Your mom called me.
Are you bleeding?

01:41:00.576 --> 01:41:03.318
- Is your car here?
- No, your mom'’s driver
drove me, why?

01:41:03.492 --> 01:41:06.669
- Where is he?
- He just dropped me off
over there. What'’s going on?

01:41:06.843 --> 01:41:08.540
[bystander] Skye!
Skye Riley. That'’s her!

01:41:08.714 --> 01:41:09.976
What happened?

01:41:11.674 --> 01:41:13.067
[bystander 1]
Hey, that'’s Skye Riley!

01:41:13.241 --> 01:41:15.199
[bystander 2]
Totally off her rocker.

01:41:15.373 --> 01:41:16.853
Hey, get out! I need your car!

01:41:17.027 --> 01:41:18.811
Ms. Riley, what--

01:41:18.985 --> 01:41:22.641
Get the fuck out of the car![bystander 3] She'’s got a gun!

01:41:22.815 --> 01:41:25.340
[Gemma]
What the fuck are you doing?

01:41:25.514 --> 01:41:28.821
Gemma, I love you,
but if I don'’t leave right
now, I'’m gonna fucking die!

01:41:28.995 --> 01:41:32.347
Fuck it!
- I'’m coming with you. Move over.
- No, Gemma, no!

01:41:32.521 --> 01:41:35.828
You don'’t know how to drive.
- Move over!
- Fuck!

01:41:36.002 --> 01:41:38.004
[bystanders clamoring]

01:41:44.794 --> 01:41:47.536
[horns honking][bystanders] Whoa!

01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:51.801
[siren wailing]

01:42:02.246 --> 01:42:04.161
Dude, where are we going?

01:42:05.119 --> 01:42:06.598
What am I doing?
Where am I going?

01:42:09.035 --> 01:42:11.125
- Where am I going? Skye!
- I don'’t know yet.

01:42:11.299 --> 01:42:13.170
- Just keep driving.
- No, I need you to explain

01:42:13.344 --> 01:42:16.130
what the hell is going on.[message alert]

01:42:18.654 --> 01:42:20.612
I need to get to Staten Island.

01:42:20.786 --> 01:42:22.658
What? Gross. Why?
Oh, shit.

01:42:24.312 --> 01:42:25.487
Fuck!

01:42:26.357 --> 01:42:27.358
Fuck!

01:42:30.231 --> 01:42:33.103
[groans]
Jesus Christ!
You need to go to a hospital!

01:42:33.277 --> 01:42:36.367
No! I need to go
- to Staten Island.
- What the fuck is going on?

01:42:36.541 --> 01:42:37.629
Why are we going
to Staten Island?

01:42:37.803 --> 01:42:39.718
[grunting]

01:42:46.072 --> 01:42:48.684
[groans]
Skye.

01:42:48.858 --> 01:42:51.165
- Gemma, pull over, please.
- What? You just told me
to go to Staten Island!

01:42:51.339 --> 01:42:53.689
Gemma, just fucking
pull over, please!

01:42:55.691 --> 01:42:59.085
All I'’ve ever done
is make your life hell.

01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:01.871
I don'’t deserve you.
So please, just pull over

01:43:02.045 --> 01:43:05.004
and get away from me so
I don'’t fuck up your life, too.

01:43:09.052 --> 01:43:11.228
No, fuck that noise.

01:43:13.665 --> 01:43:15.537
Ride or die, bitch!

01:43:23.153 --> 01:43:24.981
[shakily] I need to...

01:43:25.155 --> 01:43:26.504
I need to tell you something.

01:43:26.678 --> 01:43:28.854
What?[phone rings]

01:43:32.902 --> 01:43:33.946
Skye?

01:43:52.487 --> 01:43:55.577
Hello?[Gemma] <i>Hey, it'’s me.
I got your voicemail.</i>

01:43:55.751 --> 01:43:57.448
<i>Sorry it'’s taken me a few days
to get back to you.</i>

01:43:57.622 --> 01:43:59.711
<i>But, honestly,
I wasn'’t even sure</i>

01:43:59.885 --> 01:44:01.322
<i>if I was gonna call you back.</i>

01:44:02.627 --> 01:44:05.543
Did you spend the night
at my place?

01:44:05.717 --> 01:44:08.894
<i>What? I haven'’t been
to your place in like a year.</i>

01:44:09.068 --> 01:44:11.462
<i>Since you said I was
a "stupid opportunistic cunt,"</i>

01:44:11.636 --> 01:44:13.856
<i>remember?</i>

01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:16.380
<i>Also, what'’s up with these
weird-ass fuckin'’ text messages</i>

01:44:16.554 --> 01:44:18.252
<i>you'’ve been sending me?</i>

01:44:20.341 --> 01:44:22.299
<i>Hello?</i>

01:44:22.473 --> 01:44:24.519
[in demonic voice]
Gemma hates you, Skye.

01:44:24.693 --> 01:44:26.521
No, please. Please, Gemma, no.

01:44:26.695 --> 01:44:29.698
Please, Gemma, no.
Not you, please.

01:44:30.786 --> 01:44:32.353
No, no!

01:44:32.527 --> 01:44:34.093
No! No! No!

01:44:34.268 --> 01:44:35.399
Fuck you!

01:44:35.965 --> 01:44:37.967
Fuck you!

01:44:38.141 --> 01:44:40.099
Fuck you, fuck you!

01:44:41.057 --> 01:44:42.319
Let me the fuck out!

01:44:42.493 --> 01:44:45.191
- Let me go!
- No one cares about you.

01:44:45.366 --> 01:44:48.107
This is not real.
You'’re not driving,
you'’re not driving.

01:44:48.282 --> 01:44:50.545
You'’re not driving,
this isn'’t happening.

01:44:50.719 --> 01:44:52.460
You'’re in my head,
you'’re in my head.

01:44:52.634 --> 01:44:54.026
You'’re in my head!
You'’re in my head!

01:44:54.200 --> 01:44:56.159
You'’re in my head!

01:44:56.333 --> 01:44:57.856
You'’re in my head!

01:44:58.030 --> 01:45:01.251
You'’re not in control. I am!

01:45:03.601 --> 01:45:07.213
You'’re not in control. I am.

01:45:09.085 --> 01:45:12.741
[whispering] I'’m in control,
I'’m in control, I'’m in control.

01:45:14.046 --> 01:45:18.790
I'’m in control, I'’m in control,
I'’m in control.

01:45:19.574 --> 01:45:21.184
[gasps]

01:45:24.579 --> 01:45:26.058

[breathes heavily]

01:45:35.764 --> 01:45:37.113
[honking continues]

01:45:39.637 --> 01:45:40.769
I'’m in control.

01:45:40.943 --> 01:45:42.336
[car horns honking]

01:45:46.078 --> 01:45:48.951
[driver] Fuck you!
Learn to fucking drive!

01:45:49.125 --> 01:45:50.692
[car horn honks]

01:45:56.959 --> 01:45:58.221
[car horns honking]

01:45:59.353 --> 01:46:02.312
[horns honking][tires screech]

01:46:07.752 --> 01:46:10.320
Jesus Christ!

01:46:13.802 --> 01:46:15.804
Christ, are you okay?
Where are your shoes?

01:46:15.978 --> 01:46:17.936
I don'’t have any.
- Here, take this.
- Why do you have a gun?

01:46:18.110 --> 01:46:19.851
Just take it! Hey!

01:46:20.025 --> 01:46:21.505
If this theory of yours
doesn'’t work

01:46:21.679 --> 01:46:24.639
or you see me change
and start smiling,

01:46:24.813 --> 01:46:27.381
- shoot me in the head.
- Whoa, whoa, hold on!

01:46:27.555 --> 01:46:29.383
Hey! You need to stop it,
no matter what.

01:46:29.557 --> 01:46:30.688
We'’re going to.

01:46:30.862 --> 01:46:32.342
- Promise me!
- All right!

01:46:33.561 --> 01:46:36.346
All right, I promise
I'’ll shoot you.

01:46:39.741 --> 01:46:41.220
How do we stop my heart?

01:46:47.313 --> 01:46:49.359
[Morris] Sorry I haven'’t
done anything about the lights.

01:46:49.533 --> 01:46:50.578
[door closes]

01:46:52.362 --> 01:46:56.671
- Is this a Pizza Hut?
- It'’s the only thing I could find
for lease on short notice

01:46:56.845 --> 01:47:00.718
- that had a large enough freezer.
- Why do we need a freezer?

01:47:00.892 --> 01:47:02.416
[Morris] For your brain.

01:47:04.461 --> 01:47:05.549
Fuck.

01:47:11.294 --> 01:47:14.732
Once we stop your heart,
your brain stops
receiving oxygen.

01:47:14.906 --> 01:47:17.126
Normally,
necrosis sets in immediately.

01:47:17.300 --> 01:47:19.781
You'’d have two minutes maybe
before permanent brain damage,

01:47:19.955 --> 01:47:23.306
but if we bring your body
temperature down far enough,
we can delay the process,

01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:25.395
giving us up to nine minutes
before permanent damage.

01:47:25.569 --> 01:47:29.791
We need to make sure this thing
isn'’t able to hang around.
And...

01:47:29.965 --> 01:47:33.142
[strains] ...I like our odds
with nine minutes better
than two.

01:47:33.316 --> 01:47:34.796
[door creaks]

01:47:34.970 --> 01:47:36.145
[Morris grunts]

01:47:46.329 --> 01:47:48.287
[breathing heavily, grunting]

01:47:48.462 --> 01:47:52.291
[door creaks, thuds]
The freezer door latch
is broken.

01:47:52.466 --> 01:47:54.903
If it closes all the way,
it can'’t be opened
from the inside.

01:47:55.077 --> 01:47:56.644
[shivers]

01:47:59.429 --> 01:48:01.300
Here. Change into this.

01:48:01.475 --> 01:48:03.477
[breathes heavily]

01:48:06.392 --> 01:48:08.090
Jesus, that'’s a lot of blood!

01:48:08.264 --> 01:48:09.918
Are-- Are the cops
gonna be looking for you?

01:48:10.092 --> 01:48:12.398
I don'’t know.
[sighs] Let'’s just do this.

01:48:16.054 --> 01:48:18.230
Once your body temperature
drops low enough,

01:48:18.404 --> 01:48:20.972
I will inject you with a drug
that will cause your heart

01:48:21.146 --> 01:48:24.019
to start slowing down
until it stops.

01:48:25.150 --> 01:48:26.456
How long will it take?

01:48:29.154 --> 01:48:32.506
It'’s critical you reach
flatline as fast as possible.

01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:35.900
So I'’ll need to inject it
directly into your
internal jugular.

01:48:36.074 --> 01:48:38.816
After 30 seconds...
you'’ll be dead.

01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:41.515
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Jugular, like in my neck?

01:48:42.994 --> 01:48:44.300
[breathes shakily]

01:48:44.474 --> 01:48:45.693
Let me see the needle.

01:48:47.608 --> 01:48:48.826
[needle clatters]

01:48:49.784 --> 01:48:51.133
What the fuck, man?

01:48:51.307 --> 01:48:53.265
I know. Sorry.

01:48:54.353 --> 01:48:55.441
Lie down here.

01:48:56.399 --> 01:48:58.227
[breathes shakily]

01:49:05.974 --> 01:49:07.845
[grunts, exhales sharply]

01:49:08.542 --> 01:49:10.544
[shivering]

01:49:18.203 --> 01:49:20.118
Oh, my God,
I'’m so fucking cold.

01:49:20.292 --> 01:49:23.295
That'’s the idea. I'’ll be
monitoring your heart rate.

01:49:23.469 --> 01:49:26.951
The moment you flatline, I'’ll
start a timer for eight minutes.

01:49:27.125 --> 01:49:28.910
Once the timer'’s up,

01:49:29.084 --> 01:49:32.435
I will inject a dose of
adrenaline into your heart

01:49:32.609 --> 01:49:36.308
and start CPR resuscitation.[shivers]

01:49:36.482 --> 01:49:38.920
I can'’t believe I might die
in the freezer of a fucking
Pizza Hut.

01:49:39.094 --> 01:49:41.139
I promise
I'’m gonna bring you back.

01:49:42.314 --> 01:49:43.315
[breath shudders]

01:49:45.187 --> 01:49:46.580
Morris?

01:49:46.754 --> 01:49:49.060
I'’m sorry about your brother.

01:49:49.234 --> 01:49:50.496
I know that'’s why
you'’re doing this.

01:49:50.671 --> 01:49:52.977
Thank you for helping me.

01:49:53.151 --> 01:49:56.590
Can I ask what made you
change your mind?

01:49:58.809 --> 01:50:02.421
[shivers]
Every good thing in my life...

01:50:02.596 --> 01:50:04.989
ends up broken because of me.

01:50:07.601 --> 01:50:11.082
I hurt everything
and everyone I touch.

01:50:14.433 --> 01:50:17.001
It doesn'’t matter
what happens to me anymore.

01:50:19.525 --> 01:50:22.616
But I will not
let this fucking thing...

01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:26.532
use me to hurt anyone else.

01:50:27.272 --> 01:50:29.231
[gulps, sniffles]

01:50:33.714 --> 01:50:35.367
Put this in your mouth.

01:50:38.196 --> 01:50:39.545
Don'’t move.

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:41.460
I just have to get something.

01:50:43.462 --> 01:50:45.551
Wait. Where--
Where are you going?

01:50:45.726 --> 01:50:47.075
[door creaks open]
Shit.

01:50:47.858 --> 01:50:48.859
[grunts]

01:50:50.208 --> 01:50:51.209
Wait.

01:50:51.949 --> 01:50:52.950
Wait.

01:50:58.521 --> 01:51:00.131
[grunts] Morris?

01:51:03.091 --> 01:51:04.179

01:51:20.499 --> 01:51:21.587
[Skye] Hey!

01:51:22.980 --> 01:51:24.678
Don'’t leave me alone here!

01:51:25.374 --> 01:51:26.418
Please.

01:51:28.246 --> 01:51:29.421
Mor-- Morris?

Morris! Morris, it'’s in here!

01:52:52.113 --> 01:52:55.594
Morris can'’t help you anymore.

01:52:57.771 --> 01:52:59.120
It'’s just you and me.

01:53:02.079 --> 01:53:03.689
