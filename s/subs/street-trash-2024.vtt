WEBVTT

00:42.008 --> 00:44.210
Bring in volunteer number 85.

00:55.755 --> 00:56.623
Come.

00:57.424 --> 00:58.291
Thanks man!

00:58.591 --> 01:00.293
Let's go, let's go.

01:00.760 --> 01:01.728
Come.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.835
Careful with my jacket, okay?
It's got my stuff in it.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.806
Kinky.

01:16.342 --> 01:18.378
You didn't write down
your next of kin.

01:19.979 --> 01:21.614
Sorry, my what?

01:24.217 --> 01:25.785
Am I still gonna get paid?

01:27.620 --> 01:30.990
Volunteers receiving a
dose of synthesized sustrate...

01:30.990 --> 01:32.125
You gonna put that needle
in me?

01:32.125 --> 01:33.193
- ...V282.
- Wait, wait, stop!

01:33.193 --> 01:35.328
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait!

01:35.328 --> 01:36.563
At 14:31.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.404
Is it supposed to be itchy?

01:48.074 --> 01:49.209
It's really itchy, man.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.380
Man, it burns!

02:00.220 --> 02:02.188
What the fuck is this man?!

02:02.188 --> 02:04.290
Ah, it's in my legs! Ah!

02:46.866 --> 02:48.668
Clarence, get back in there!

03:52.498 --> 03:53.733
Fuck!

03:54.701 --> 03:55.969
It worked.

04:03.543 --> 04:04.811
Take your dream holiday

04:04.811 --> 04:07.714
of a lifetime
to Cape Town, South Africa.

04:07.714 --> 04:10.917
Explore the Mother City
and the wonderful wildlife.

04:11.317 --> 04:12.385
Mayhem in the city.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.587
Homeless are fighting
against the government.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.923
As always, people are fighting
for their rights.

04:17.323 --> 04:18.992
Unemployment is at 90%.

04:19.425 --> 04:21.294
Mayor Mostert
is killing us slowly!

04:21.294 --> 04:22.528
He's taken everything from us!

04:22.829 --> 04:24.497
Working with
the government shows

04:24.497 --> 04:27.300
that you are in
a high percentage of the rich.

04:27.700 --> 04:30.370
Middle class becomes smaller
and smaller each year with the--

04:30.737 --> 04:34.641
Businesses are shutting down
due to corporate monopolies

04:34.641 --> 04:37.543
leading to unemployment
and more homelessness.

04:37.777 --> 04:40.113
In other news,
hundreds of drones

04:40.113 --> 04:41.914
have been released
by Mayor Mostert

04:42.215 --> 04:44.117
to service our streets
and keep them--

04:44.484 --> 04:47.353
With Cape Town experiencing
frequent power cuts,

04:47.353 --> 04:49.389
the need for rechargeable
powerhouse sources

04:49.389 --> 04:50.957
that has led
to lithium shortages

04:51.658 --> 04:53.393
and skyrocketing battery prices.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.628
Now authorities continue
to search

04:55.628 --> 04:57.263
for this elusive Rat King.

04:57.697 --> 05:00.099
Well, we all know the Rat King
is the ringleader

05:00.099 --> 05:01.501
in black market operations,

05:01.968 --> 05:05.305
and the distribution
of anti-government propaganda.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.372
Well, you heard--

05:06.673 --> 05:08.608
The government
has been recruiting children

05:08.608 --> 05:10.043
for training programmes.

05:10.276 --> 05:11.878
The mayor was quoted today

05:11.878 --> 05:14.147
that this will only make
our city stronger,

05:14.147 --> 05:15.281
and a brighter future
for us all.

05:15.515 --> 05:16.749
Nobody wants to fuck!

05:17.116 --> 05:18.451
I don't know what to say!

05:18.451 --> 05:19.952
Nobody out here
is getting laid.

05:21.387 --> 05:22.922
If there's anybody out there
that wants to f--

05:23.156 --> 05:24.357
The last known rhino

05:24.357 --> 05:25.525
has being killed by poachers--

05:25.525 --> 05:26.959
It's the eighth
consecutive year

05:26.959 --> 05:29.228
of Mayor Mostert.
Will he be re-elected?

05:40.006 --> 05:41.708
Come here! Come on!

05:42.175 --> 05:43.343
Come here, motherfucker!

05:43.876 --> 05:45.211
Come here!

05:45.211 --> 05:47.347
Come here, motherfucker!
Go around!

05:49.382 --> 05:50.917
Come here, motherfucker!

05:53.319 --> 05:54.821
I'll get you, you fuck!

06:01.694 --> 06:02.628
Hey!

06:04.630 --> 06:07.133
Get on the fucking radio!
If you see that piece of shit

06:07.133 --> 06:08.801
you tell me where the fuck--

06:09.202 --> 06:10.903
- Fuck!
- I'm coming for you!

06:12.238 --> 06:13.373
Poes!

06:13.873 --> 06:15.074
Wait up!

06:15.074 --> 06:16.175
You fucking cunt,
come here!

06:16.509 --> 06:18.111
Don't you go
up there!

06:18.111 --> 06:19.112
Oh, my God, cramp!

06:19.445 --> 06:20.913
Jesus Christ, my legs!

06:21.414 --> 06:23.082
Oh, my God! Jesus!

06:25.685 --> 06:26.986
Come here, you little fuck!

06:28.554 --> 06:30.723
Jesus! Oh, my God!

06:31.724 --> 06:33.960
Don't you turn that corner!

06:35.061 --> 06:36.028
No!

06:37.764 --> 06:38.831
Come back!

06:41.033 --> 06:42.602
Oh, my God! My God!

06:44.871 --> 06:45.805
Whoo!

06:46.806 --> 06:48.841
Cunt!
Get the fuck outta the way!

06:52.445 --> 06:55.381
Twelve hours erect! Dick dust!

06:55.782 --> 06:59.218
Dick dust! Twelve hours erect!

06:59.552 --> 07:01.287
- Twelve whole hours!
- Society!

07:01.287 --> 07:03.189
Dick dust? 12 hours erect?

07:03.189 --> 07:05.625
- For real?
- Would I lie to you?

07:05.625 --> 07:07.660
- And that vial?
- The vial?

07:07.660 --> 07:08.961
Not for you!

07:10.863 --> 07:11.831
Motherfucker!

07:12.565 --> 07:14.534
Hey!

07:15.802 --> 07:18.438
Come here!
Come here, motherfucker!

07:24.844 --> 07:26.779
Wait! You little fuck!

07:28.147 --> 07:30.483
Fuck you!

07:31.884 --> 07:32.985
Just stay down!

07:33.386 --> 07:35.721
Oh, God, what the fuck...

07:36.389 --> 07:37.690
...did you throw in my face?

07:37.990 --> 07:40.660
Twelve hours erect!
Twelve!

07:41.127 --> 07:42.061
What the fuck?

07:42.495 --> 07:43.563
What are you looking at?

07:44.030 --> 07:45.798
Fuck you. Move!

07:46.332 --> 07:47.567
Chef!

07:48.334 --> 07:49.469
The gate!

07:51.003 --> 07:52.004
Chef, get the gate!

07:52.004 --> 07:53.906
Get to the gate!

07:54.440 --> 07:56.976
Hey, everyone!
This pervert cop's got a boner,

07:56.976 --> 07:58.744
and he's trying to fuck me
in the arse!

08:01.781 --> 08:03.950
Fucking motherfucker!

08:09.555 --> 08:12.859
Ah!

08:13.759 --> 08:15.394
What the fuck
are you looking at?

08:16.896 --> 08:18.231
What the hell
were you two doing?

08:18.231 --> 08:19.131
Were you kerfuffling?

08:20.366 --> 08:21.767
Did you take it up the tuchus?

08:21.767 --> 08:23.769
Look, I'm not judging.
It's just... He's a cop.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.205
So, did you get the battery?

08:26.205 --> 08:27.073
Of course, I've got it.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.309
Hey, get that khazer thing
away from me!

08:30.676 --> 08:32.879
- I don't know where it's been.
- Suit yourself.

08:33.713 --> 08:35.014
Mazel tov, though.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.949
It's been a while since
I've seen one of those things.

08:36.949 --> 08:39.118
Yeah, it's been
pretty dry out there these days,

08:39.118 --> 08:40.353
and guys like Boner Cop

08:40.353 --> 08:42.054
don't make it exactly
any easier.

08:42.889 --> 08:43.756
But luckily...

08:44.390 --> 08:46.025
I have you to watch my back.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.228
Oy vey!
Get that Schmeckle away!

08:49.228 --> 08:51.364
Oh, shit! I forgot about that.

08:51.797 --> 08:53.132
I really shouldn't let it go
to waste.

08:56.769 --> 08:58.504
Or I could just use
the 12 o'clock trick.

08:58.504 --> 08:59.672
The 12 o'clock trick?

08:59.672 --> 09:00.840
Yeah, it's when
you shove your dick

09:00.840 --> 09:02.308
behind your belt straight up
at 12 o'clock.

09:02.642 --> 09:04.110
Put it in stealth mode.

09:04.343 --> 09:05.278
Why are you telling me this?

09:05.611 --> 09:07.013
...are mean people...

09:07.713 --> 09:10.516
- Are nutcases!
- Easy, easy, easy...

09:10.516 --> 09:12.418
Easy, guys!
No need to hurt me, okay?

09:12.885 --> 09:14.954
Okay, lemme just see
what I've got in my bag, okay?

09:16.255 --> 09:17.657
Fuck.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.525
Ronald.

09:19.525 --> 09:21.160
No. Keep your schnose out of it.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.665
If she's not one of them,
she's one of us.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.938
Woah, woah, woah, woah,
woah, woah! Clover!

09:33.005 --> 09:33.973
My man!

09:33.973 --> 09:36.175
- Let's be civil.
- For fuck's sake, Ronald!

09:36.943 --> 09:37.843
You can't save

09:37.843 --> 09:39.612
- every stray you find.
- Oh, I can't, can I?

09:40.212 --> 09:41.247
Look at Chef!

09:41.247 --> 09:43.716
He was a fucking loser
before I came along.

09:43.716 --> 09:45.051
Did you know that
he was actually skinny

09:45.051 --> 09:46.352
before he ended up
on the streets?

09:46.686 --> 09:47.820
And just look at him now!

09:48.454 --> 09:50.489
Man, I love that fat,
podgy face!

09:50.489 --> 09:52.024
Oy va voy!

09:52.425 --> 09:53.526
Think I'm gonna pass out!

09:54.226 --> 09:56.429
Why is it always violence
with you guys?

09:56.796 --> 09:58.397
Can't we just make
a deal? Huh?

09:59.098 --> 10:02.134
Nobody gets hurt,
and everybody walks away happy.

10:02.134 --> 10:02.868
Kind of.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.605
It's gonna have to be
a pretty fucking good deal.

10:08.541 --> 10:10.843
A fresh new battery
for your boss.

10:11.677 --> 10:13.613
I know the Rat King
is fond of these.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.754
- One week.
- One week? That's it?

10:22.855 --> 10:24.357
Inflation's getting out
of control.

10:27.293 --> 10:28.961
Hugs and kisses to the Rat King.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.738
You didn't need to do that!

10:39.538 --> 10:40.873
Oh, I'm sorry. My bad.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.075
I didn't realize you enjoyed

10:43.075 --> 10:44.510
getting the shit kicked out
of yourself.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.146
What, you guys here
to shake me down too?

10:48.047 --> 10:49.815
You think I've got it easy,
and you've got it tough?

10:50.449 --> 10:51.517
I'm on my own out here, pal.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.153
- You owe us a battery.
- No, she doesn't.

10:55.354 --> 10:56.422
You're good.

10:59.191 --> 11:00.126
It's okay.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.029
It's okay.

11:03.295 --> 11:04.797
It's okay!

11:04.997 --> 11:06.766
Uh-uh, it's just another mouth
to feed,

11:07.233 --> 11:08.334
another noch-schlepper.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.069
There's no way
she's coming home with us.

11:10.336 --> 11:12.038
No fucking way!

11:23.482 --> 11:24.316
Thank you!

11:32.224 --> 11:34.193
Huh? Nice, huh?

11:34.660 --> 11:35.895
Yeah, it's, uh...

11:36.729 --> 11:37.930
It's a cosy-looking spot.

11:38.330 --> 11:40.933
Man, you should've seen
this place before we renovated.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.602
The Chi was way off.

11:43.836 --> 11:45.805
But now it's got a... a nice,

11:45.805 --> 11:47.239
open flow.

11:47.239 --> 11:48.107
Cool, man.

11:48.674 --> 11:49.575
Sounds great.

11:49.842 --> 11:50.910
Jesus!

11:50.910 --> 11:52.344
What the...

11:52.344 --> 11:54.246
- What the fuck is that thing?
- Stop! Stop!

11:54.547 --> 11:56.015
What the fuck is on its face?

11:57.850 --> 11:59.018
What's wrong with my face?

11:59.885 --> 12:02.054
He's a friend.
He's part of the crew.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.924
Oh, shit. Sorry, man. Uh...

12:05.925 --> 12:08.194
it's, uh...
it's nice to meet you.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.097
Jesus, Ronald,

12:11.097 --> 12:12.898
this kin nearly gave me
a poes klap!

12:17.403 --> 12:18.437
What's with all the, uh...

12:20.206 --> 12:21.040
Oh, this?

12:21.540 --> 12:25.344
Just the latest and greatest in
stealth camouflage technology.

12:25.344 --> 12:26.512
Nobody sees you coming.

12:26.712 --> 12:28.314
I've been here
for about three hours.

12:28.681 --> 12:29.882
Nobody suspected a thing.

12:29.882 --> 12:31.350
There hasn't been anyone here
for three hours.

12:32.718 --> 12:34.520
- Yassis, Chef!
- Jesus!

12:34.520 --> 12:36.489
Have you been eating
dead pigeons again, my bru?

12:37.456 --> 12:39.358
- Ha!
- Haha, I told you,

12:39.358 --> 12:40.526
couch camouflage

12:40.526 --> 12:43.028
- is fucking bullshit.
- You are fucking delusional.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.697
You got caught way before me.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.333
The only reason I broke cover
is because Chef

12:47.333 --> 12:49.502
is poisoning me
with his rancid insides.

12:51.070 --> 12:51.971
Top up?

12:53.472 --> 12:54.373
You read my mind.

12:55.808 --> 12:57.943
I present to you, the twins!

12:58.577 --> 13:01.180
The delightful Pap
and Wors!

13:01.747 --> 13:03.182
It is quite moreish, isn't it?

13:03.382 --> 13:05.518
The most incredible crackheads
that you'll ever meet.

13:06.418 --> 13:07.453
And vegan friendly.

13:08.187 --> 13:10.422
- Well, kind of.
- If two vegans have an argument,

13:10.856 --> 13:11.991
is it considered beef?

13:15.795 --> 13:18.330
Oh! And this is Offley.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.166
Hi, Offley!

13:21.734 --> 13:23.769
Tell me something,
has she met 2-Bit, yet?

13:23.769 --> 13:26.505
Ah, 2-Bit
is the fucking best, hey!

13:26.505 --> 13:27.973
No, Sockle!

13:29.275 --> 13:30.643
Shut up now!

13:30.643 --> 13:32.311
- But scary.
- Very scary.

13:33.412 --> 13:34.313
Absolutely not!

13:34.613 --> 13:35.414
Great guy overall!

13:36.215 --> 13:37.116
Forget about it!

13:37.116 --> 13:38.951
I won't leave my kids
with him, you know?

13:38.951 --> 13:40.753
You stupid.
You think I'm stupid?

13:40.753 --> 13:41.687
You're the idiot, man!

13:42.087 --> 13:43.689
Beautiful eyes!

13:50.329 --> 13:51.263
Is he okay?

13:52.264 --> 13:53.165
Yeah, he's fine.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.967
He's always just talking
to himself.

13:55.868 --> 13:57.369
More like an imaginary friend.

13:57.369 --> 14:00.172
Oh, Sockle's real, all right!
If I wasn't real,

14:00.506 --> 14:01.373
could I do this?

14:08.747 --> 14:12.051
Ronald, where's the battery?

14:12.518 --> 14:13.385
I-- I dropped it.

14:14.620 --> 14:15.554
He gave it away.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.257
- Chef?
- You gave it away?

14:18.924 --> 14:22.061
- I, um... I tr-- traded it.
- For what?

14:23.996 --> 14:25.197
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.899
I didn't ask
for any of this! Okay?

14:26.899 --> 14:28.167
I didn't need rescuing.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.501
It's every man
for himself out there,

14:29.501 --> 14:31.170
and I can look after myself
just fine.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.339
You've got a lot
to learn, Bubala.

14:33.672 --> 14:35.541
You're not going to get far
thinking like that.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.476
Not around here anyway.

14:38.143 --> 14:39.545
What are we going to do
for dinner?

14:40.045 --> 14:41.347
Can't cook without power.

14:41.947 --> 14:43.282
And we've got no gas.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.584
Everyone's having sleep
for dinner.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.086
I'm fucking starving!

14:47.419 --> 14:48.587
I can cook up a batch

14:48.587 --> 14:52.791
- of my salty scrotum stew.
- Shut up! Enough!

14:52.791 --> 14:53.959
Citywide curfew

14:53.959 --> 14:55.160
is now in effect.

14:55.527 --> 14:57.496
You are ordered
to remain in your homes,

14:57.496 --> 14:58.764
and off the streets.

14:59.365 --> 15:02.001
Failure to comply
will result in prosecution.

15:03.035 --> 15:05.170
Well, I guess that's bedtime
for all of us too.

15:05.504 --> 15:08.240
You too, Alex.
We need you fresh for tomorrow.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.843
Tomorrow?
What's happening tomorrow?

15:11.477 --> 15:13.646
There's a mattress
and some covers over there.

15:14.179 --> 15:16.682
There's also a dildo,
but no batteries.

15:18.984 --> 15:20.152
Okay.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.024
Night, Offley!

15:26.425 --> 15:28.193
Shit! I'm horny!

15:28.427 --> 15:29.628
Aren't you horny?

15:41.340 --> 15:42.841
So basically, what I'm saying

15:42.841 --> 15:46.679
is that street people
are like onions.

15:46.912 --> 15:49.214
- We can make you cry.
- No.

15:49.214 --> 15:51.183
We have
a characteristically bad smell?

15:51.183 --> 15:53.018
Yeah, that too,
but what I mean is...

15:53.018 --> 15:54.820
...we have layers.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.423
So the first layer
is direct contact with the skin.

15:57.656 --> 16:00.659
The second layer is insulation,
which keeps you warm,

16:01.026 --> 16:03.028
and the third layer
is the shell layer,

16:03.228 --> 16:04.964
which protects you
from the rain, and the wind.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.733
So, food. What is food?

16:08.200 --> 16:09.335
Anything can be food.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.304
A can of hummus stuffed
in a drainpipe.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.740
Some frozen matzah balls
guarded by wild dogs.

16:16.575 --> 16:17.676
But you've got to be clever.

16:17.676 --> 16:19.912
Dairy and fats. Not great.

16:20.245 --> 16:21.947
Give you a case of the shits
like you won't believe.

16:23.349 --> 16:25.351
Now, if you're really desperate,
you can try eating fucking rats.

16:25.718 --> 16:26.585
This place is great,

16:26.585 --> 16:28.087
because it's crawling
with the fuckers.

16:28.087 --> 16:29.521
Coming in and out all day,

16:29.755 --> 16:31.757
shitting in the frozen goods,
pissing on the rice,

16:31.991 --> 16:33.625
having little fucking rat orgies
in the quinoa.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.028
You don't want this. Trust me.

16:37.963 --> 16:41.467
Oh, man! Fuckin' khaza again!
Maybe next time.

16:43.869 --> 16:45.671
The first rule of fighting

16:46.005 --> 16:48.307
is to try and avoid it
at all costs.

16:48.307 --> 16:51.243
Violence is the last refuge
of the incompetents.

16:51.477 --> 16:52.878
Okay, so,

16:53.445 --> 16:56.181
Chef is gonna come at me
in slow motion.

16:56.515 --> 16:57.750
Watch carefully.

16:59.885 --> 17:04.189
And...
knife to the neck.

17:04.590 --> 17:05.958
Fuck, Chef!

17:06.492 --> 17:08.894
- Just the punch, no knife.
- Oh, okay.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.629
- Okay. Again.
- Okay.

17:11.930 --> 17:15.667
Dragon claw to the eye.

17:15.667 --> 17:18.670
You see what I did there?

17:20.139 --> 17:23.042
The most important thing
is choosing the right moment.

17:23.342 --> 17:24.777
- That's key.
- Tiger claw!

17:25.310 --> 17:27.413
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
So, what if you

17:27.413 --> 17:29.348
have no choice?
What if you have to fight?

17:29.348 --> 17:31.817
Yeah, well...
...I guess you just have

17:31.817 --> 17:32.885
to get your arse beaten then.

17:33.585 --> 17:36.755
Well, we'll... we'll go again.
In slow motion. Okay?

17:37.523 --> 17:38.390
Chef?

17:39.792 --> 17:43.429
Chef, where you going?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.868
♪ Remember when you bake
Your cake ♪

17:49.868 --> 17:51.370
♪ To always let it rise ♪

17:51.370 --> 17:52.471

17:55.808 --> 17:56.642
♪ Ha! ♪

17:57.109 --> 17:58.143
Thank you very much.

17:58.710 --> 18:00.546
Okay, okay, okay.
Think I've got it.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.582
Okay, Alex, Chef, line up.

18:04.183 --> 18:06.118
Alex, don't worry.
Chef will not hurt you.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.053
- I promise.
- Fuck!

18:08.053 --> 18:09.188
God!

18:09.188 --> 18:11.056
- What'd you do that for?
- Pick your moment, right?

18:11.356 --> 18:12.624
I'm bleeding!
I'm bleeding!

18:12.624 --> 18:14.226
That was...

18:14.226 --> 18:15.494
...that was
actually really good.

18:16.762 --> 18:17.663
Are you okay, baby?

18:17.663 --> 18:19.198
How long have you
been standing there for?

18:19.932 --> 18:21.100
Are you a fighter?

18:29.274 --> 18:31.009
So, uh,
thank you to the press...

18:31.443 --> 18:32.778
Another day, another speech.

18:33.078 --> 18:34.413
And I know I can count on you

18:34.413 --> 18:37.116
for your continued support
in the upcoming elections.

18:37.416 --> 18:39.318
He's the reason they shut
my family's business down,

18:39.618 --> 18:41.253
made the rule,
taking away the factories

18:41.253 --> 18:42.688
from the working class,
and made it government only.

18:42.988 --> 18:46.692
It sends hundreds of these,
uh, these beautiful drones

18:47.226 --> 18:49.161
around the city to...

18:49.661 --> 18:52.865
...suck up all the, uh,
the nasty little, um...

18:53.765 --> 18:55.134
...uh...

18:56.368 --> 19:00.005
particles. CO2 particles,
that is.

19:00.372 --> 19:02.641
Uh... save the planet,
and all that.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.043
Oh, they said to me, "Clive..."

19:05.544 --> 19:07.179
"...you can't do that!"

19:07.546 --> 19:09.348
And I said to them, "Watch me!"

19:10.215 --> 19:11.984
And you should have seen them

19:11.984 --> 19:13.085
- watch me.
- Move along!

19:13.352 --> 19:14.586
Are you talking to us?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.456
He wants us to move along.
We're moving!

19:17.456 --> 19:19.224
Move along.

19:19.224 --> 19:20.792
Vote now. Vote now.

19:22.227 --> 19:24.429
So, using the site samples
gathered from

19:24.429 --> 19:26.198
the New York incident in 1986,

19:26.498 --> 19:28.800
we were able to synthesize
the Viper compound

19:29.001 --> 19:32.237
and reproduce it artificially
on a massive scale.

19:32.237 --> 19:34.039
And bind it
to an aerosol medium,

19:34.039 --> 19:35.140
which really opens--

19:35.140 --> 19:36.341
Who's this person talking
right now?

19:36.909 --> 19:38.810
Actually, scratch that,
I don't care who you are.

19:38.810 --> 19:40.245
Just show me
how my baby boy is doing.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.881
Yes, sir. Um, right this way.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.186
Cocksuckers
better let me out of here,

19:47.186 --> 19:48.754
I'll rip your shriveled
little dicks off!

19:48.754 --> 19:50.255
Oh, God.

19:50.255 --> 19:51.623
What the fuck is that?

19:51.623 --> 19:53.859
...between my teeth
like they're fucking grapes!

19:53.859 --> 19:56.595
I could have sworn, I said
I wanted them exterminated.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.131
Not threatening me
with a good time.

19:59.131 --> 20:00.966
I'll rip open your jaws,
and I'll shit down

20:00.966 --> 20:01.833
- your throats!
- Initiating...

20:01.833 --> 20:03.335
I'll fucking piss in your eyes!

20:03.335 --> 20:05.337
...demonstration
of aerosol Viper-283.

20:05.337 --> 20:07.072
- Prepare to--
- You fucking cocksuckers...

20:07.072 --> 20:08.607
Um, you gonna need these.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.550
If this doesn't work...

20:20.252 --> 20:22.287
I think you would be
a perfect test subject

20:22.287 --> 20:24.590
for the rectal delivery system.
Don't you?

20:29.661 --> 20:30.562
Smile!

20:30.562 --> 20:31.630
Get me out of here!

20:31.630 --> 20:33.065
It's your lucky day, old hag.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.833
Let me fucking out of here!

20:35.400 --> 20:36.969
Let's see what you got.

20:38.370 --> 20:39.972
Fuckers! Fuckers!

20:40.973 --> 20:41.907
Fuck you!

21:47.906 --> 21:50.142
Yes! Yes! Yes!

21:50.742 --> 21:53.078
Yes!
That's what I'm talking about.

21:53.378 --> 21:54.646
That was incredible.

22:05.223 --> 22:06.792
What the fuck?

22:13.565 --> 22:15.467
I mean, think about it,
that's all I'm saying.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.570
Weird elf guy,
flies into kids' rooms at night,

22:18.570 --> 22:19.871
promising them they'll be
young forever.

22:20.372 --> 22:21.640
He's a pedo, for sure.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.742
You're full of shit.

22:23.742 --> 22:26.945
Peter Pan is the hero,
and he defeats Hook.

22:26.945 --> 22:28.914
But how do you think
Captain Hook got to Neverland

22:28.914 --> 22:29.681
in the first place?

22:29.915 --> 22:32.284
Pan kidnapped him,
and then he tosses him away

22:32.284 --> 22:33.352
when he gets too old.

22:33.785 --> 22:34.619
Guys!

22:35.320 --> 22:37.322
The guy's one sick motherfucker!

22:37.589 --> 22:39.291
- Right?
- Alex, what are you doing?

22:39.658 --> 22:41.093
Just be cool.
Wait for me.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.898
So, what happens
to the rest of the Lost Boys?

22:47.432 --> 22:48.934
He kills them
when they get too old.

22:48.934 --> 22:50.502
Kaput!

22:51.837 --> 22:52.871
Oh, my God.

22:54.106 --> 22:57.509
So, you're telling me that Hook
is actually the hero?

22:57.509 --> 22:58.744
Of course, he is.

22:58.744 --> 23:00.712
He's the only one
that ever stands up to Pan.

23:01.079 --> 23:03.415
Pan's the ultimate villain,
he's basically a serial killer,

23:03.882 --> 23:05.384
and he treats Wendy
like a shiksa.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.085
And don't get me started
on Tinkerbell.

23:08.019 --> 23:09.087
Guys!

23:10.822 --> 23:13.158
Wait for us!
Chef, come on!

23:23.301 --> 23:25.704
Okay, everybody,
come and get it.

23:27.339 --> 23:28.573
Courtesy of Mayor Mostert

23:28.573 --> 23:30.175
- and his goons.
- Nice!

23:31.109 --> 23:33.011
Okay, ten points and go.

23:33.612 --> 23:38.617
Fanny, Minky, Foofy, Vajayjay,
Bean, Manny, Ellen, uh,

23:38.617 --> 23:41.586
flower, fandango,
penis fly trap,

23:41.586 --> 23:43.889
um...
...axe wound, and,

23:43.889 --> 23:46.425
uh, there's another one--
Noo-noo! And beef curtains.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.326
Very good. Well done.

23:48.527 --> 23:53.165
Thank you. Okay, uh,
20 points. It tastes like...

23:53.165 --> 23:55.300
So, what happened was,

23:55.300 --> 23:56.535
we're running after
this forklift.

23:56.535 --> 23:58.069
Can you believe it?
A fucking forklift?

23:58.069 --> 23:59.938
I don't want to play
this game anymore.

24:02.507 --> 24:04.209
- Brilliant!
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

24:04.209 --> 24:05.310
What?

24:05.710 --> 24:08.447
- What if it's poisoned?
- Oh, we stole it from them.

24:09.648 --> 24:12.484
- Yes?
- Woah, woah, woah, woah!

24:13.718 --> 24:15.454
You said you stole it
from City Hall, right?

24:15.654 --> 24:16.888
I just said that!

24:17.289 --> 24:18.457
What if it's a trap?

24:22.594 --> 24:25.430
But then, if they knew
that we knew it was a trap,

24:26.164 --> 24:28.733
and if we stole it from them,
then they would know

24:28.733 --> 24:30.302
that we would know
that they knew it was poisoned.

24:31.102 --> 24:33.572
So naturally,
the only logical thing to do

24:34.206 --> 24:35.006
would be to drink it.

24:37.542 --> 24:39.511
Good shit.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.680
Hey Offley, you want some?

24:43.748 --> 24:45.250
Okay, but you're missing out.

24:47.319 --> 24:49.187
I was in the army with Chef,

24:49.621 --> 24:51.656
and I spent
almost two years on the border.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.625
Saw some
of the most horrific shit

24:53.625 --> 24:54.993
that, like, fried my brain.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.028
And after I was discharged,

24:57.662 --> 24:59.331
the government
didn't give a fuck!

24:59.731 --> 25:01.666
And that's how I landed up here
on the streets.

25:04.736 --> 25:07.873
Kak, man.
I'll tell you this guy's story.

25:07.873 --> 25:10.609
He's a real sicko!
He gets more ass

25:11.243 --> 25:12.077
than a toilet seat.

25:13.545 --> 25:14.746
On the weekends,

25:14.746 --> 25:16.882
Ronald visits
a little weekly gathering

25:16.882 --> 25:19.751
called, "Sex Addicts Anonymous."

25:19.985 --> 25:23.255
Every single person that I see,
I really...

25:24.523 --> 25:25.657
wanna fuck them.

25:26.725 --> 25:28.960
And I wonder,
what they'll be like in bed.

25:30.495 --> 25:31.796
I wanna run my tongue...

25:33.098 --> 25:34.733
along their inner thighs.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.670
Makes me rock hard.

25:44.609 --> 25:45.677
I'm not gay,

25:45.677 --> 25:48.947
but 50 bucks is 50 bucks.

25:49.581 --> 25:51.349
One client
is usually not enough.

25:51.683 --> 25:53.652
You got to at least get two.

25:53.652 --> 25:54.719
Why two?

25:55.687 --> 25:56.888
So, he has enough

25:56.888 --> 25:59.057
to visit the meeting
across the street.

26:01.192 --> 26:02.127
I lost my whole family.

26:04.229 --> 26:05.063
I can't lie...

26:06.298 --> 26:07.599
I've been dying to party.

26:09.467 --> 26:11.069
Imagine the person
in front of you,

26:11.670 --> 26:13.071
is your brother...

26:14.339 --> 26:16.007
your father, your mother.

26:24.516 --> 26:26.351
Ooh... I want that!

26:26.851 --> 26:29.688
Uh-uh.
That's not for you, stranger.

26:30.388 --> 26:31.656
You're not ready for that.

26:32.724 --> 26:35.193
Didn't mean to steal money
from their purse.

26:39.164 --> 26:42.067
Hey!
I never got your name.

26:43.702 --> 26:45.604
I am Society.

26:46.037 --> 26:47.872
Taking one step closer

26:48.607 --> 26:49.841
to being healed.

26:49.841 --> 26:52.877
Okay, so you go
to Sex Addicts Anonymous

26:53.311 --> 26:54.179
for clients,

26:54.179 --> 26:56.615
and you go
to Narcotics Anonymous to score?

26:56.615 --> 26:58.950
That is so fucked up.

26:59.284 --> 27:00.185
That's fucked up?

27:00.819 --> 27:02.854
You think that's fucked up?
I'll tell you what's fucked up.

27:03.088 --> 27:05.824
These two fucking weirdos
created the most nasty,

27:05.824 --> 27:08.727
disgusting, unspeakable drug
I've ever heard of.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.138
What the fuck, guys?
Cat shit?

27:20.972 --> 27:24.142
In our defense,
that shit was dope.

27:24.843 --> 27:27.145
Yeah, that shit was fire
to be honest.

27:27.145 --> 27:29.214
Listen to
these chickenshit kids!

27:29.681 --> 27:30.782
Back in my day,

27:30.782 --> 27:32.417
I was boofing two ounces
a night.

27:35.954 --> 27:39.724
Sunshine, you're next.
Sparkle, finger my ass.

27:40.425 --> 27:42.427
Oh, yeah, this is great!

27:42.794 --> 27:44.062
- Ronald.
- Hm?

27:44.062 --> 27:45.430
Come,
I wanna show you something.

27:46.531 --> 27:48.099
- Really?
- Yeah, come!

27:57.909 --> 27:59.110
2-Bit, are you okay?

28:01.746 --> 28:03.114
Do you wanna ask me something?

28:03.114 --> 28:05.784
You're killing me here, 2-Bit.
If you're not going to fuck her,

28:06.017 --> 28:08.520
then I will.
My dick is hard and ready to go.

28:08.720 --> 28:09.821
Either that,

28:09.821 --> 28:11.456
or I'm skull-fucking Wors
over there!

28:22.434 --> 28:27.939
This is Moo-Moo,
and this is Kitty.

28:30.608 --> 28:31.710
Oh...

28:32.544 --> 28:33.445
nice.

28:52.163 --> 28:53.698
Greetings.

28:53.932 --> 28:56.801
On behalf of Mayor Mostert,
we would like to offer you

28:56.801 --> 28:58.737
a non-perishable edible slab

28:58.737 --> 29:00.872
to say thanks
for your continued existence.

29:02.407 --> 29:03.308
Fuck off!

29:05.744 --> 29:07.645
Do you know
who you're talking to?

30:31.663 --> 30:33.198
But Alex...

30:33.398 --> 30:34.265
...Alex.

30:35.266 --> 30:38.236
When you first came to us,
I didn't like you.

30:39.304 --> 30:40.138
But now...

30:41.005 --> 30:43.107
now, I know you're a mensch.

30:44.275 --> 30:45.944
You're the best thing
that ever happened to us.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.280
And I love you.

30:50.181 --> 30:51.316
And I hope you do not die.

30:52.984 --> 30:54.619
Hey, who turned off the music?

30:58.890 --> 31:00.491
Well, well, well...

31:01.593 --> 31:04.696
- What's going on here?
- Fuck, it's the Rat King guys.

31:04.696 --> 31:07.498
We've got a few freaks
getting freaky!

31:07.932 --> 31:09.033
A week already.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.870
Ronald. Time's up.

31:13.137 --> 31:14.939
Rat King wants to see her.

31:19.477 --> 31:22.447
Our schedule's pretty much arses
to ankles right now, guys.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.817
So, just give me your details
and I'll--

31:29.854 --> 31:31.222
We're not
fucking around, Ronald.

31:33.491 --> 31:34.525
She's coming with us.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.562
Who the fuck turned off
the music?

31:44.636 --> 31:46.004
It was this fucker
right here.

31:46.504 --> 31:48.439
Give him a kiss, 2-Bit.

31:50.441 --> 31:51.409
Fuck!

31:56.314 --> 31:58.316
Rat King won't stand
for this, Ronald!

32:02.453 --> 32:04.355
We know where to hit you
where it hurts.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.472
Are you going
for a midnight stroll?

32:22.106 --> 32:23.207
Why are you awake?

32:32.750 --> 32:34.519
I can't sleep.

32:36.554 --> 32:37.555
I never can.

32:39.157 --> 32:42.560
I think I might've been a bat
in a previous life.

32:46.631 --> 32:49.300
Listen, I get it.

32:51.302 --> 32:53.338
Don't pretend to know me,
because you don't.

32:56.341 --> 32:58.676
You're all alone in this world.

33:00.178 --> 33:02.647
You've lost every person
that you've ever cared about,

33:04.849 --> 33:06.451
and you don't trust anyone
anymore,

33:06.451 --> 33:08.353
'cause every time
that you've let your guard down,

33:09.420 --> 33:10.355
let somebody in...

33:12.957 --> 33:16.094
they've betrayed you.
Every single time.

33:20.531 --> 33:22.166
Fuck you.

33:23.368 --> 33:25.003
You don't fucking know me.

33:26.637 --> 33:28.539
I lost both of my parents.

33:29.640 --> 33:32.143
After they closed the factory,
we had no money.

33:33.311 --> 33:35.947
My dad was killed trying to keep
the factory open

33:35.947 --> 33:37.281
late at night
just to support us,

33:37.815 --> 33:39.017
to put food in our mouths.

33:40.284 --> 33:42.487
And after that, my mother died
of a broken heart.

33:42.987 --> 33:44.122
She just gave up.

33:44.455 --> 33:46.457
One morning, I went to go
and wake her up.

33:46.824 --> 33:48.026
She was just dead.

33:51.396 --> 33:54.599
I'm sorry that you had
to go through that.

33:55.867 --> 33:57.035
And then my sister...

33:59.537 --> 34:00.571
my baby sister.

34:02.440 --> 34:06.077
She was ten years old
when the soldiers took her away.

34:07.278 --> 34:09.914
The one day I went to go
and get food for us,

34:10.248 --> 34:12.250
and by the time I got back,
she was being loaded

34:12.250 --> 34:13.818
into the back of a truck
with the other kids.

34:16.387 --> 34:19.290
And I ran after that truck
as fast as I could.

34:20.525 --> 34:22.393
I tried my best to keep up,
but I just,

34:22.393 --> 34:23.861
I couldn't.
I couldn't keep up.

34:24.095 --> 34:25.797
Everything inside me
told me to keep going

34:25.797 --> 34:28.633
when I couldn't anymore,
but I just kept on going.

34:30.001 --> 34:32.170
I got left in the dust
like everyone else.

34:35.573 --> 34:36.641
And it kills me.

34:37.442 --> 34:39.710
It kills me not knowing
what happened to her...

34:40.078 --> 34:42.180
...what she might've had
to go through.

34:43.681 --> 34:44.782
I've been alone...

34:45.817 --> 34:46.851
...for so long, Ronald.

34:47.785 --> 34:49.287
It's all that I know.

34:54.192 --> 34:55.460
You know...

34:56.561 --> 34:57.728
it's not your fault.

35:00.731 --> 35:04.502
It's gonna be okay.
I promise. I promise.

35:05.103 --> 35:07.371
Okay?

35:08.139 --> 35:09.607
It's going to be okay.

35:14.412 --> 35:17.014
Help! Please, help him.
Please, help us.

35:17.014 --> 35:18.883
Oh, my God!

35:18.883 --> 35:19.617
Let me help you there, sir.

35:19.817 --> 35:22.420
Get away from us,
you filthy, piece of shit hobos.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.455
Can't you see we're businessmen?

35:24.455 --> 35:26.023
But my brother, look at him.

35:26.023 --> 35:27.191
He's so ill, man.
Please help us!

35:27.191 --> 35:28.759
I don't give a fuck about
your dying brother.

35:28.759 --> 35:30.862
Now, piss off,
before I call the police,

35:30.862 --> 35:31.729
you peasants.

35:32.563 --> 35:34.398
I was on the way
to the stock market,

35:34.599 --> 35:37.668
and I saw you being accosted
by those disgusting vagrants.

35:38.236 --> 35:41.572
Insider trading, huh?
We should talk.

35:42.039 --> 35:43.441
I'll get Linda
to call your people

35:43.441 --> 35:44.542
and we can set up a brunch.

35:44.742 --> 35:48.312
You know, us industrialists,
we... we need to stick together.

35:49.113 --> 35:50.314
Anyway, I've got to run.

35:50.715 --> 35:53.351
My labradoodle is having
her braces removed today.

35:53.885 --> 35:54.852
Cheerio!

36:00.291 --> 36:02.693
- Get a fucking job, you bum.
- Fuck you!

36:02.927 --> 36:04.262
There's no red light here!

36:04.262 --> 36:05.796
It's definitely in there,
just lemme know

36:05.796 --> 36:06.731
if it's red or green.

36:11.636 --> 36:13.704
Hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck are you doing?

36:13.704 --> 36:14.672
Woah, woah, woah,

36:14.672 --> 36:15.940
don't sneak up
on people like that.

36:17.275 --> 36:18.676
Stop her!

36:18.676 --> 36:20.745
She's got my leather briefcase!
She stole it!

36:20.745 --> 36:24.682
Yeah, world's first
vegan cryptocurrency!

36:24.682 --> 36:26.350
SoyCoin!

36:26.717 --> 36:30.955
Oopsie-daisy!

36:32.857 --> 36:35.193
Oh, my nose!

36:35.459 --> 36:37.895
My beautiful nose!

36:59.717 --> 37:00.651
Remember us?

37:06.057 --> 37:07.658
- Alex!
- Alex!

37:08.259 --> 37:09.460
Alex!

37:12.063 --> 37:12.997
Just look around.

37:13.331 --> 37:14.498
Yeah, that's right.

37:14.498 --> 37:17.168
We're giving away tasty,
nutritious food

37:17.168 --> 37:18.636
to all the dregs of society.

37:18.869 --> 37:21.272
I was walking down the street
and this little, uh...

37:22.573 --> 37:24.242
- this dirty little vagrant...
- Where is everyone?

37:24.642 --> 37:26.010
...child comes up to me

37:26.010 --> 37:26.811
and says,

37:27.712 --> 37:29.947
"Clive, you do so much
for this city,

37:30.514 --> 37:32.683
but my daddy and mommy
don't feed me."

37:33.751 --> 37:34.819
So, I said to him,

37:35.786 --> 37:38.856
"Well, then your mommy and daddy
better come on down

37:39.423 --> 37:42.326
to the food parcel handout
on 5th Avenue."

38:17.194 --> 38:20.064
Old Geep
nearly got you there, hey!

38:21.899 --> 38:22.900
Geep!

38:24.235 --> 38:25.569
Come here, my little boy!

38:25.836 --> 38:28.839
Come here!
I know what you want!

38:29.540 --> 38:32.743
Oh, my special little
sauce boy!

38:37.581 --> 38:41.786
Gentle, good boy.
Suck my little foot.

38:42.720 --> 38:44.655
Mm, you like Mommy's foot, hey?

38:44.922 --> 38:47.224
I'm fucking done.
Just fucking kill me,

38:47.224 --> 38:48.726
there's no way in fuck
I'm doing that.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.329
I think Geep likes you.

38:53.097 --> 38:55.966
He wants his little friend
to stay.

38:56.167 --> 38:57.668
Don't you, Geep?

38:57.668 --> 38:59.603
Look, I get it! I fucked up!

38:59.804 --> 39:01.706
Okay, I can--
I can get you what you need.

39:01.706 --> 39:02.973
I can get you something
that you need.

39:02.973 --> 39:05.543
Please, just--
I can't fucking be here anymore.

39:05.743 --> 39:08.012
What's that, Geep?

39:08.312 --> 39:11.082
Is she being naughty?

39:11.415 --> 39:14.652
- Is she telling lies?
- I can prove it!

39:15.119 --> 39:16.087
Look...

39:22.493 --> 39:24.295
I can get you a battery
that lasts you for months,

39:24.495 --> 39:25.930
maybe even years.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.124
Yep.

39:54.792 --> 39:55.826
I'll give you...

39:57.027 --> 39:58.028
one day.

40:07.138 --> 40:08.472
Morning!

40:10.741 --> 40:11.709
Cunts.

40:16.480 --> 40:17.548
You seen this man?

40:19.083 --> 40:20.751
Liar.

40:21.051 --> 40:22.887
You? Huh?

40:25.489 --> 40:26.924
And you, huh?

40:27.892 --> 40:29.493
Motherfucking poes!

40:30.127 --> 40:31.028
Hello!

40:32.430 --> 40:33.564
Seen this man?

40:34.532 --> 40:36.434
Look closely, you fucking idiot.

40:37.968 --> 40:40.438
Cool, open your mouth.
Open your mouth. There we go!

40:41.472 --> 40:43.574
You need a meal. Fuck off!

40:46.143 --> 40:47.845
Where are you?!

40:47.845 --> 40:49.413
Here!

40:49.413 --> 40:50.481
One for you!

40:53.150 --> 40:54.885
Hey, guys, check out the haul!

40:54.885 --> 40:56.921
- Chef, you don't think you can--
- Nope!

40:59.156 --> 41:00.858
Hey, we didn't get any!

41:00.858 --> 41:02.493
Oh, you didn't. I'm so sorry.

41:02.493 --> 41:04.128
I think there's a couple
more back here.

41:05.362 --> 41:06.931
Ah, here it is!

41:06.931 --> 41:08.999
Oh, ple-- You're...

41:08.999 --> 41:10.000
You're poes!

41:11.368 --> 41:12.536
Fuck you!

41:12.536 --> 41:14.238
Oh, they gave us
some sandwiches!

41:14.238 --> 41:17.074
That's very generous!
I'll have some of these later.

41:17.074 --> 41:18.642
Hey, what are you...
what are you doing?

41:18.642 --> 41:20.077
No, that's mine!

41:25.549 --> 41:28.085
Chef! Chef! Are you okay?

41:28.486 --> 41:30.187
Ah, I'm keeping shtum.

41:30.754 --> 41:33.123
I don't wanna talk about it.
Let's just go on.

41:33.591 --> 41:36.660
Why you all got such
long faces, boys?

41:36.660 --> 41:38.529
- What's up?
- Because we're hungry.

41:38.529 --> 41:40.130
We're schmatters, we're broke.

41:40.564 --> 41:41.565
And sober.

41:41.966 --> 41:45.302
Ah, you got to stop sucking on
the dick of the man sometime.

41:45.302 --> 41:48.038
Do it for yourselves, man. Fuck!

41:52.209 --> 41:53.811
- Society.
- Hm?

41:55.546 --> 41:56.847
Have you got any stock?

41:59.583 --> 42:00.651
Funny thing that...

42:01.252 --> 42:05.656
You know that
Society hasn't seen his supplier

42:06.190 --> 42:07.925
for days. I think...

42:09.026 --> 42:11.629
It's like he's gone missing,
he's just sort of...

42:12.263 --> 42:13.864
disappeared, he's like...

42:14.598 --> 42:15.966
vanished.

42:17.568 --> 42:20.204
- So, you got nothing?
- Well, yeah, I mean,

42:20.771 --> 42:22.172
keeping up appearances.

42:25.376 --> 42:27.211
- You still got the vial.
- Yes, I have.

42:27.211 --> 42:30.447
I mean, if I've told you once,
I've told you a thousand times,

42:30.814 --> 42:32.550
you're not ready for it yet.

42:39.590 --> 42:41.058
Be careful out there, boys.

42:42.092 --> 42:43.193
These are...

42:44.395 --> 42:46.163
strange days.

43:56.867 --> 43:58.235
Help me!

44:07.177 --> 44:08.612
announcer over PA]
Citywide curfew

44:08.612 --> 44:09.780
is now in effect.

44:09.780 --> 44:11.949
You are ordered to remain
in your homes.

44:12.182 --> 44:14.818
Failure to comply
will result in prosecution.

44:15.586 --> 44:16.754
So, there's this lonely guy,

44:17.187 --> 44:18.889
keeps scaring the shit out
of his cat.

44:18.889 --> 44:20.691
And he has this weird,
slutty fish

44:20.691 --> 44:22.192
that just wants to get laid
all the time.

44:22.559 --> 44:24.094
So, he makes this wish
upon a star

44:24.094 --> 44:26.096
to turn a puppet
into a real boy.

44:26.597 --> 44:28.198
So, now why does he want
a real boy, huh?

44:28.198 --> 44:29.433
Oh, my fuck!

44:29.433 --> 44:30.968
- Sex doll.
- Exactly.

44:31.168 --> 44:33.637
This creepy clockmaker
wants a real boy.

44:34.171 --> 44:35.973
Probably because he's tired
of the dick splinters

44:35.973 --> 44:37.441
from Pinocchio's tight arse.

44:38.042 --> 44:40.177
So, then this bitch blue
fairy shows up

44:40.177 --> 44:42.546
and she turns him
into this kind of wooden zombie.

44:42.780 --> 44:44.815
But she lays out all these rules
before he's really real.

44:44.815 --> 44:46.116
He must be selfless, and brave,

44:46.116 --> 44:47.685
and truthful
and all of this shit.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.353
I mean, who the fuck
is this bitch anyway?

44:49.353 --> 44:50.120
This is what I'm saying.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.022
The kid is barely
ten seconds old,

44:52.022 --> 44:54.024
and, uh, he can barely walk,

44:54.024 --> 44:57.094
and she's going, "So long, bye,
can't help you anymore."

44:57.327 --> 44:59.630
But before she goes
for some random reason,

44:59.630 --> 45:02.866
she makes it so that whenever
he tells a lie, his nose grows.

45:03.067 --> 45:05.803
And I bet Geppetto enjoyed
sitting on that nose, eh?

45:06.036 --> 45:07.938
So, then the kids go off
to this pleasure island

45:07.938 --> 45:09.339
and they get turned
into fucking donkeys,

45:09.339 --> 45:11.141
which I'm pretty sure
is a metaphor for sex,

45:11.141 --> 45:13.644
- child trafficking.
- Fuck, Chef.

45:13.644 --> 45:15.446
You really are a deep thinker.

45:15.879 --> 45:17.114
There she is!

45:17.581 --> 45:18.415
Alex.

45:19.049 --> 45:20.851
Are you okay? What happened?

45:21.085 --> 45:23.353
Hey, where were you?
We couldn't find you!

45:24.221 --> 45:27.091
Guys, it is great to see you all
but we're in deep shit.

45:27.091 --> 45:28.959
I'm-- I'm in deep fucking shit.

45:29.393 --> 45:30.527
What do you mean?

45:30.761 --> 45:32.596
I got jumped by more
of those Rat King weirdos,

45:32.596 --> 45:34.098
and they took me underground.

45:34.098 --> 45:36.266
And then there was like
this weird little guy

45:36.266 --> 45:38.802
that was chained up like a dog
and then... Jesus, fuck,

45:39.036 --> 45:41.371
the Rat King. She's, like,
hooked up to all these machines,

45:41.371 --> 45:44.675
and they are not fucking
around this time. Okay?

45:44.675 --> 45:45.909
If I don't get them
what I promised,

45:45.909 --> 45:47.311
I'm totally fucked.

45:48.612 --> 45:49.780
We got you, Alex.

45:50.380 --> 45:52.616
They fuck with one of us,
they fuck with all us.

45:53.117 --> 45:55.452
I can't let you guys
put yourselves in danger for me.

45:55.452 --> 45:56.987
Well, we got you, kid.

45:57.287 --> 45:58.122
Okay.

45:58.889 --> 46:00.424
Thanks, guys.

46:00.791 --> 46:02.359
But what are we gonna do?

46:02.359 --> 46:03.494
I think I've got a plan.

46:07.164 --> 46:08.165
One of these.

46:09.600 --> 46:11.602
- A flashlight?
- No, it's a suppository.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.237
- That's a crack pipe.
- No, guys,

46:13.237 --> 46:14.204
it's a drone.

46:15.172 --> 46:16.140
Oh!

46:16.440 --> 46:18.442
Okay, guys we've got
the alleyway over here,

46:18.442 --> 46:19.543
the dumpster and the drain.

46:19.543 --> 46:21.912
We move out, go down the street,

46:21.912 --> 46:23.347
and make sure
the cops don't see us

46:23.347 --> 46:24.982
and find a place
to set up a trap.

46:26.216 --> 46:29.019
Chef and Wors you get behind
the dumpster and be ready.

46:29.019 --> 46:31.722
Woah. Woah, woah. Hold on.
This isn't going to work.

46:32.089 --> 46:33.991
I've got a medical condition.
I can't crouch.

46:34.358 --> 46:35.759
Okay, then just stand.

46:36.160 --> 46:38.095
No, that's not going
to work either.

46:38.095 --> 46:39.797
Why not?
You're standing right now!

46:39.797 --> 46:41.031
No.

46:41.031 --> 46:43.567
I'm going to keep watch,
and then Pap and Ronald,

46:43.567 --> 46:45.369
you guys are gonna crouch
behind the dumpster.

46:45.369 --> 46:47.171
- And when you get ready--
- No, no, no.

46:47.171 --> 46:49.106
Ronald needs to be
on the roof with me.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.508
What? Why am I on the roof?

46:51.942 --> 46:54.011
Yeah, I think I'm being
underutilized in this plan.

46:54.378 --> 46:56.079
Okay,
we've got Chef and Wors

46:56.079 --> 46:57.314
over here
and we've got Pap there.

46:57.314 --> 46:58.615
No, no, no,
that's not gonna work.

46:58.615 --> 46:59.950
Chef is going to be here.

46:59.950 --> 47:01.618
Maybe we put Pap
with his brother.

47:01.618 --> 47:02.820
Yeah, but then
maybe Ronald

47:02.820 --> 47:04.221
should rather be over here.

47:04.221 --> 47:05.689
Listen, why don't
I just sit on the couch

47:05.689 --> 47:07.291
and I'll keep watch from here?
Huh?

47:07.291 --> 47:08.859
No, I'm just saying!

47:08.859 --> 47:10.594
...so emotional.

47:10.594 --> 47:11.995
Guys, guys, guys, guys!

47:11.995 --> 47:13.330
Guys! Please,

47:13.330 --> 47:15.499
just shut the fuck up
and let me do what I need to do.

47:15.966 --> 47:18.368
Pap, Wors,
you guys do your thing.

47:18.368 --> 47:21.471
Chef, you're keeping watch.
2-Bit is the bait.

47:21.471 --> 47:23.540
We wait until we hear
one of those drone things

47:23.540 --> 47:25.909
then Chef gives a signal.

47:33.317 --> 47:35.619
Now, you wait until
the drone gets close enough

47:35.619 --> 47:37.354
not too early, not too late.

47:38.055 --> 47:39.957
As soon as you've driven
the drone back far enough,

47:39.957 --> 47:41.191
me and Ronald
will spring the trap.

47:41.425 --> 47:44.428
- Fucking drone.
- Fuck you, drone.

47:44.761 --> 47:46.063
What if something goes wrong?

47:46.263 --> 47:48.298
Nothing can go wrong,
this plan is bulletproof.

47:48.298 --> 47:49.199
Holy shit!

47:49.199 --> 47:50.968
Hold on!

47:50.968 --> 47:52.636
Just jump off!

47:54.972 --> 47:57.574
Get off it!

47:57.574 --> 47:58.508
Now, 2-Bit!

48:05.449 --> 48:08.352
2-Bit, hit that thing.
Hit, hit, hit!

48:10.754 --> 48:12.789
I can't, they're young people.

48:20.497 --> 48:22.099
2-Bit, you okay?

48:22.099 --> 48:24.568
Mazel tov! Mazel tov, guys!

48:24.568 --> 48:27.671
I really love the teamwork.
It gave me such nachas!

48:27.671 --> 48:29.172
Where the fuck were you, huh?

48:29.172 --> 48:30.874
Oh, you know, I was schvitzing,
and you guys looked like

48:30.874 --> 48:32.242
you had it all under control.

48:32.242 --> 48:34.711
Besides, too many Chefs,
am I right?

48:34.711 --> 48:36.413
Yeah, one Chef is

48:36.413 --> 48:37.447
too many for me.

48:37.981 --> 48:39.950
You were so good!

48:40.150 --> 48:41.351
You were so good!

48:41.351 --> 48:43.120
You remember when you were
hanging onto that thing?

48:43.620 --> 48:45.656
Guys, shut the fuck up!

48:46.089 --> 48:48.625
Jesus!

48:48.825 --> 48:51.395
2-Bit,
you fucking saved us, man.

48:53.764 --> 48:56.066
I would save that ass
for dessert.

48:56.066 --> 48:59.202
I've got a big, fat, veiny one
with your name on it.

48:59.202 --> 49:02.072
- 2-Bit! 2-Bit!
- Not now!

49:04.841 --> 49:05.943
The mayor is Daddy.

49:06.276 --> 49:08.211
Woah, woah,
it's saying something!

49:08.211 --> 49:11.315
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Chef, be careful.

49:11.715 --> 49:12.950
There might be some sort of

49:12.950 --> 49:14.351
self-destruct mechanism
or something.

49:14.351 --> 49:17.955
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...
- Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

49:18.221 --> 49:20.424
- Chef, be careful!
- Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

49:20.657 --> 49:23.293
Viper-283--

49:25.595 --> 49:28.198
Chef!

49:28.799 --> 49:29.700
Are you okay?

49:34.705 --> 49:37.140
Oh, fuck!

49:44.181 --> 49:45.749
Oh, my God,
what's happening?

49:46.083 --> 49:48.085
Chef! Chef!

50:00.831 --> 50:02.699
Chef! Oh, my God!

50:03.333 --> 50:04.201
Chef!

50:06.103 --> 50:07.404
Don't die on me!

50:08.772 --> 50:09.940
Don't die on me, Chef!

50:09.940 --> 50:12.042
Stop it!
Just fucking stop it!

50:12.042 --> 50:13.276
He's dead already, man!

50:21.852 --> 50:22.686
Chef...

50:27.891 --> 50:29.393
I'm so sorry, my friend.

50:31.828 --> 50:33.296
It's my fault!

50:36.466 --> 50:37.434
Viper...

50:44.441 --> 50:45.375
Fuck!

51:33.757 --> 51:38.128
I'd give all my eskimo pies
for one more moment with him.

51:38.929 --> 51:40.730
I'd give all my samosas.

51:41.231 --> 51:45.368
- I'd give all my DVDs.
- I'd give my one good Nike.

51:46.103 --> 51:48.205
I would give him all our meth.

51:48.205 --> 51:50.140
I would give him
all our soylent greens!

51:50.140 --> 51:51.575
I'd give him
my two-minute noodles!

51:51.775 --> 51:54.344
- I'd give him my blanket!
- I'd give him Ronald's blanket!

51:54.344 --> 51:57.481
Hey, we get it, guys!
We all miss him.

52:04.221 --> 52:05.589
Sorry about your friend.

52:09.759 --> 52:10.727
We'll fix this.

52:13.763 --> 52:17.701
That robot was tuning
Mayor Mostert's its Daddy?

52:17.934 --> 52:19.469
Yeah, that was mos kak weird.

52:19.469 --> 52:22.038
Like, "Daddy," in a kinky way.

52:22.038 --> 52:23.874
Yeah, just before Chef got...

52:23.874 --> 52:26.009
Must have been that gas--

52:26.009 --> 52:27.344
I mean,
I don't know some sort of...

52:27.577 --> 52:29.679
some sort of chemical weapon?

52:30.046 --> 52:31.014
Fuck!

52:31.448 --> 52:33.450
All those puddles everywhere,

52:33.450 --> 52:35.085
all of that goo,
those were all people.

52:35.085 --> 52:36.987
The fucking mayor!

52:37.354 --> 52:40.524
We gonna die.
We all gonna fucking die.

52:40.724 --> 52:42.859
The mayor is fucking
melting people.

52:44.161 --> 52:45.795
They're exterminating everybody.

52:50.433 --> 52:52.636
Argh! It's just Offley!

52:53.670 --> 52:54.938
Are you okay, Offley?

52:56.873 --> 52:57.841
Chef's dead.

53:00.277 --> 53:01.845
Guys, Listen up!

53:03.213 --> 53:05.849
Chef may be dead,
but we're all still here.

53:06.683 --> 53:07.984
If we fall apart now,

53:08.318 --> 53:10.153
we'll never take back
what is ours.

53:10.353 --> 53:12.989
These are our streets,
our city!

53:13.356 --> 53:15.725
Now is the time
to band together.

53:15.959 --> 53:18.228
To show strength, to fight back

53:18.528 --> 53:20.964
and take our revenge
on Mayor Mostert.

53:21.364 --> 53:23.600
In honor of Chef's memory!

53:24.301 --> 53:25.702
Will you ride with me?

53:28.939 --> 53:30.073
2-Bit,

53:30.073 --> 53:32.642
- that was really--
- Good.

53:32.642 --> 53:35.045
Straight from the heart!
Those fuckers are gonna pay!

53:35.345 --> 53:37.514
Martin Luther King,
"I have a dream," bro.

53:38.415 --> 53:41.184
I am so fucking pumped.

53:41.451 --> 53:44.721
The next fucking cop I see,

53:45.121 --> 53:46.957
I'm gonna pull his
fucking head off!

53:54.664 --> 53:55.699
Whoo!

53:56.032 --> 53:57.801
Fuck, I love a good drive in!

54:01.304 --> 54:02.939
All you pieces of shit,

54:03.473 --> 54:06.142
get in the fucking van!

54:06.142 --> 54:07.544
Oh, fuck.

54:08.345 --> 54:09.879
It's Boner Cop!

54:15.785 --> 54:17.020
Run!

54:17.454 --> 54:18.755
Alex, get out of here!

54:21.424 --> 54:22.993
Get the fucking drone!

54:25.161 --> 54:26.263
Poes.

54:35.905 --> 54:37.674
For your own safety,

54:37.674 --> 54:40.510
you are reminded
to stand behind the yellow line.

54:41.177 --> 54:42.379
For your own safety,

54:42.646 --> 54:45.482
you are reminded
to stand behind the yellow line.

54:45.915 --> 54:47.517
For your own safety,

54:47.517 --> 54:50.287
you are reminded
to stand behind the yellow line.

54:50.854 --> 54:52.422
For your own safety,

54:52.422 --> 54:54.891
you are reminded
to stand behind the yellow line.

54:55.959 --> 54:57.527
For your own safety,

54:57.527 --> 55:00.063
you are reminded
to stand behind the yellow line.

55:02.699 --> 55:03.566
Oh, Jesus!

55:19.249 --> 55:20.984
Wait, no,
I just live up the road!

55:20.984 --> 55:23.753
Mad man! You mad man!

55:23.753 --> 55:26.022
Your cooperation
is greatly appreciated.

55:33.463 --> 55:34.898
I hope Alex got away okay.

55:35.432 --> 55:36.800
Where are they taking us?

55:37.734 --> 55:38.702
I don't know.

55:39.202 --> 55:40.904
Maybe it's just
temporary housing.

55:40.904 --> 55:43.973
The smell of ass in here
is making me hungry!

55:43.973 --> 55:48.178
Since there's a citywide
extermination going on,

55:48.178 --> 55:51.481
I think that might be bullshit!

55:55.819 --> 55:59.222
So, on the count of three,
when this fucking door opens,

55:59.422 --> 56:00.490
we take them.

56:00.924 --> 56:04.527
- We take them? What the fuck?
- We can't do that.

56:06.296 --> 56:07.664
What happens if one of us
gets hurt again?

56:07.664 --> 56:10.600
They're fucking killing us,
Ronald!

56:10.600 --> 56:13.002
I'm-- I'm ready, my bro.
Are you ready?

56:13.002 --> 56:15.705
Okay, 2-Bit, here we go!
Let's go, we're gonna do this.

56:15.705 --> 56:18.108
Assholes and elbows, here we go.

56:18.108 --> 56:19.576
2-Bit, you ready? The gang?

56:19.576 --> 56:21.511
Everybody else,
are you ready to go?

56:23.880 --> 56:24.914
St... stop.

56:30.520 --> 56:32.422
There's another one! Go, go!

56:40.463 --> 56:41.998
Keep moving forward.

56:42.932 --> 56:43.933
Obey orders.

56:45.235 --> 56:46.703
Keep moving forward.

56:47.504 --> 56:49.172
- Obey orders.
- Everybody just stick together.

56:49.739 --> 56:51.174
We don't want to get lost
in the crowd.

56:52.742 --> 56:54.144
Please!

56:56.446 --> 56:57.580
- Please!
- Listen!

56:57.580 --> 56:58.748
- Please!
- I can't help--

56:58.748 --> 57:00.316
I can't die here! Please!

57:00.550 --> 57:02.852
Obey orders.

57:04.120 --> 57:05.155
Keep moving forward.

57:06.256 --> 57:07.123
Obey orders.

57:08.258 --> 57:09.859
Keep moving forward.

57:10.927 --> 57:11.795
Obey orders.

57:13.129 --> 57:14.497
Keep moving forward.

57:15.265 --> 57:16.599
Obey orders.

57:17.000 --> 57:18.067
Keep close.

57:18.334 --> 57:19.669
Keep moving forward.

57:19.903 --> 57:20.870
Obey orders.

57:22.172 --> 57:23.573
Keep moving forward.

57:50.700 --> 57:51.534
Jesus.

57:52.068 --> 57:53.837
Where is she?
Where's the Rat King?

57:55.338 --> 57:56.573
Didn't make it.

57:57.507 --> 57:59.075
We got a new boss now.

57:59.342 --> 58:01.311
That thing is your boss?

58:01.711 --> 58:04.080
I don't know. I'm here
because I need your help.

58:04.314 --> 58:06.049
From your old pal, the Rat King.

58:06.049 --> 58:08.284
Everyone's gone.
We're all that's left.

58:08.284 --> 58:10.220
And the mayor is the one
that's responsible, okay?

58:10.220 --> 58:12.755
I've seen what he does to us,
and it is totally fucked!

58:12.755 --> 58:14.691
We have a place for you,
if you want it.

58:15.325 --> 58:17.126
You're smart...

58:17.494 --> 58:19.062
...and I know you can fight.

58:19.429 --> 58:21.331
We could use you,
wherever we end up.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.665
You want me to go with you?

58:23.032 --> 58:25.602
I'd rather have you inside
the tent pissing out,

58:25.935 --> 58:27.537
than outside
the tent pissing in.

58:27.537 --> 58:28.705
Don't you get it?

58:28.705 --> 58:30.306
There isn't gonna be
a you or a us,

58:30.306 --> 58:31.674
if we don't do anything.

58:32.942 --> 58:35.111
I'm not gonna let them take
the city and my friends.

58:35.645 --> 58:36.880
They're all that really matters.

58:36.880 --> 58:38.882
- I'm standing here.
- Excuse me.

58:39.215 --> 58:41.150
- What the fuck?
- If we do

58:41.150 --> 58:42.218
do this for you...

58:44.454 --> 58:45.755
what's in it for us?

58:49.292 --> 58:50.193
Move it!

58:52.929 --> 58:53.763
Now!

58:56.599 --> 58:57.901
Keep moving forward.

58:58.301 --> 58:59.536
Obey orders.

59:00.770 --> 59:02.105
Keep moving forward.

59:02.605 --> 59:04.807
Eyes down!
What the fuck you looking at?

59:06.442 --> 59:07.577
Move along!

59:07.577 --> 59:09.379
We've got to get you processed.

59:09.379 --> 59:10.580
Keep moving!

59:14.784 --> 59:16.686
Keep moving forward.

59:16.686 --> 59:18.187
- Obey orders.
- All of you,

59:18.187 --> 59:19.055
in here!

59:20.590 --> 59:22.659
Hey! He's with us!

59:22.659 --> 59:24.127
He's with us!

59:26.195 --> 59:28.431
Wors! Guys! What's happening?

59:28.431 --> 59:32.268
Hey, it'll be okay! Just chill.
We won't leave you behind.

59:34.337 --> 59:37.040
Don't worry, Offley!
We'll get you out of there!

59:37.240 --> 59:41.244
Hey, man. What is the plan?
How are we gonna get Pap out?

59:42.679 --> 59:44.080
We'll wait for the patrols
to thin out

59:44.080 --> 59:46.082
and then we'll get hold
of the keys.

59:46.082 --> 59:49.552
Wait? We can't wait.
They killing people, man!

59:49.752 --> 59:52.288
Why don't you use your fucking
army ninja skills

59:52.288 --> 59:53.656
and get us out?

59:54.290 --> 59:55.325
Everybody out!

59:56.225 --> 59:57.660
Hey, what are you doing?!

59:57.660 --> 59:59.395
Wors, help me! Help!

59:59.395 --> 01:00:00.797
Where are you taking them?

01:00:01.497 --> 01:00:03.366
- Wors!
- It'll be okay.

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.801
I love you, bro.

01:00:10.039 --> 01:00:12.742
We'll open the main gate
and clear a path to the exit.

01:00:13.009 --> 01:00:15.678
You go find your friends
and then we'll meet back up.

01:00:16.479 --> 01:00:19.048
Whatever you do,
don't get spotted

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:21.250
because we won't
come back for you.

01:00:21.584 --> 01:00:23.419
Whatever,
just make sure there's an exit.

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:25.788
- Okay?
- Alex...

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:28.691
Just remember our deal.

01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:32.729
And don't fuck it up!

01:00:35.131 --> 01:00:37.133
Are you ready
to spill some blood?

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:43.973
Move, move,
move, move!

01:00:43.973 --> 01:00:46.442
Get in! Move, move, move!

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:48.678
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Move!

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:50.947
- Wait!
- Move!

01:00:51.614 --> 01:00:52.649
Get in!

01:00:59.922 --> 01:01:02.225
- Let us out!
- Please, let us out!

01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:23.680
You are in the presence

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:25.948
of a genius right now.

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:28.017
Elon Musk,

01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:31.688
Martin Bingus, and now me!

01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:36.626
Unfortunately,
no one's going to know who I am.

01:01:36.893 --> 01:01:39.862
But I'm going
to change the world!

01:01:40.596 --> 01:01:42.198
I have changed the world!

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.301
None of you guys
are gonna be there to see it.

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:48.071
But everything's
going to be better now.

01:01:48.938 --> 01:01:50.773
- Everybody's going to be happy--
- Sir!

01:01:50.773 --> 01:01:53.009
Sir, please! We need your help.

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:55.712
My friend's not well.
We need... we need a doctor.

01:01:56.512 --> 01:01:58.114
What seems to be the problem?

01:01:59.649 --> 01:02:03.419
You people just don't get it.

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:06.689
Sorry, I...
I... I can't hear you.

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:08.958
You're gonna need to
speak a little louder.

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:10.493
He's, uh...
he's deaf in one ear.

01:02:12.462 --> 01:02:13.796
I said--

01:02:14.130 --> 01:02:15.832
Hold him! Hold him!

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.900
Get the keys!

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:19.669
I've got it!

01:02:20.169 --> 01:02:22.004
How's it, my brother?

01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:38.187
Society?

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:42.825
You are finally ready, my China.

01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:44.794
It's time!

01:02:46.863 --> 01:02:48.164
Bada bing, bada boom!

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:02.445
I never thought I'd actually
ever say this, but...

01:03:04.013 --> 01:03:06.282
maybe this isn't the best time
for me to get high.

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:11.320
That will make you see things
nobody's ever seen.

01:03:11.854 --> 01:03:13.790
You will do things
nobody's ever done.

01:03:13.790 --> 01:03:16.392
That's not any normal narcotic.

01:03:17.393 --> 01:03:20.530
That will make you run faster,
jump higher.

01:03:21.464 --> 01:03:24.033
You'll think faster
than the speed of light,

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.434
my brother.

01:03:26.769 --> 01:03:28.070
Go save your friends.

01:03:34.744 --> 01:03:36.245
This isn't gonna make me...

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:40.049
Fuck it!

01:03:52.195 --> 01:03:53.162
Shit.

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:00.136
It's getting hot in here.

01:04:00.136 --> 01:04:02.305
Can I have one of those?

01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:03.239
No.

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:20.156
And the good guys always win.

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:22.525
So, ergo,
we must be the good guys.

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:23.559
Ah...

01:04:24.227 --> 01:04:26.963
Gosh, did you
see that lady's head explode?

01:04:26.963 --> 01:04:29.632
Yeah! Yeah, she was like,
"Please don't kill me!"

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:30.933
and I'm like, "Nah".

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.506
Anyway, how's your
sister doing? She all right?

01:04:37.506 --> 01:04:39.008
She's good! She misses you.

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:43.246
Shit!

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:49.118
Security breach.

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:52.955
Security breach.

01:04:52.955 --> 01:04:54.056
That's the last one.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.959
Did you see Offley?
Where's Ronald?

01:04:58.327 --> 01:04:59.629
Security breach.

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:03.099
Security breach.

01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:06.035
Ronald, are you okay, my bru?

01:05:08.437 --> 01:05:10.139
Security breach.

01:05:11.274 --> 01:05:13.075
Jesus Christ!

01:05:15.511 --> 01:05:17.013
Security breach.

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:20.616
Brothers!

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.922
Stop fucking around!
Get the guns!

01:05:26.222 --> 01:05:27.523
Security breach.

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:33.262
I really wanna dance.
Don't you guys wanna dance?

01:05:38.167 --> 01:05:40.436
- Another two down!
- Another two souls lost!

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:42.705
Ronald's definitely
not getting into heaven.

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.574
There's another four coming!

01:05:46.442 --> 01:05:47.810
Security breach.

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:49.779
I really think
it's working, man.

01:05:52.048 --> 01:05:54.116
But I'm feeling...
I'm feeling pretty good.

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:55.818
You know,
I don't feel scared at all.

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:57.687
I'm... I'm feeling invincible!

01:05:57.687 --> 01:05:59.555
You know? I can do anything!

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.633
Whoo!

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:14.470
What the fuck is that?

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:17.907
I'll suck your dick,
whatever you want.

01:06:17.907 --> 01:06:20.276
I'm not gonna die
without one last bang!

01:06:20.843 --> 01:06:21.978
You can see him?

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:23.279
Of course,
I can fucking see him!

01:06:23.846 --> 01:06:26.882
There's a horrible, fat little
blue ghoul sitting right there!

01:06:27.483 --> 01:06:29.318
Has he been there
the entire time?

01:06:29.318 --> 01:06:31.354
Sockle's always been here, baby!

01:06:31.354 --> 01:06:33.122
Are you guys fucking mal?

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:36.726
What are you talking about?

01:06:37.526 --> 01:06:39.428
Got you, fuckers!

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:51.907
What just happened?

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.809
We're never gonna
talk about that,

01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:55.578
but let's head that way.

01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:13.295
Who the fuck is that?

01:07:15.965 --> 01:07:17.800
The rest of you go look
for another exit.

01:07:18.467 --> 01:07:19.435
Yeah.

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.453
Just couldn't
wait your turn.

01:07:37.987 --> 01:07:40.322
You impatient fuck.

01:07:40.823 --> 01:07:42.758
I fucking dare you to shoot me.

01:07:43.092 --> 01:07:46.495
- I fucking dare you!
- Ronald, shut the fuck up!

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:49.231
I'm invincible.
Bullets can't hurt me!

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:50.733
Just try it! I dare you!

01:07:51.033 --> 01:07:52.168
- Shoot me!
- Okay.

01:07:55.704 --> 01:07:58.607
- Nope, not a thing.
- You can't feel that?

01:07:59.575 --> 01:08:00.776
No. Nothing.

01:08:01.811 --> 01:08:03.212
What about now?

01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:05.081
Mm-mm.

01:08:06.849 --> 01:08:08.584
Come on, you have to feel that!

01:08:08.984 --> 01:08:10.986
No. Not a thing.

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.856
You okes are fucked in the head.

01:08:14.623 --> 01:08:15.791
Kill them!

01:08:19.361 --> 01:08:21.330
- Oh, fuck!
- Alex!

01:08:26.335 --> 01:08:28.537
Oh, fuck!

01:08:44.954 --> 01:08:46.188
You're alive!

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:47.690
She's alive!

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.558
You came to save us!

01:08:50.025 --> 01:08:51.360
You kinda left it
to the last minute

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:53.195
but I'm not complaining.

01:08:53.529 --> 01:08:55.397
- Gotta pick your moment, right?
- Right.

01:08:55.664 --> 01:08:57.700
Holy shit, that looks bad!
Are you okay?

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.703
Oh, this?
Almost forgot about that.

01:09:04.406 --> 01:09:05.975
Are you high right now?

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.210
He's higher
than a giraffe's pussy.

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:10.779
- And that's high!
- Good one, Sockle.

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:12.615
It's a classic!

01:09:13.382 --> 01:09:15.618
Guys, we really need to
find Pap. Now!

01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:17.086
Yeah, I think
I know where he is.

01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:18.220
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

01:09:19.288 --> 01:09:21.924
Hey, 2-Bit!
Hey, where's everybody going?

01:09:43.012 --> 01:09:44.547
Offley, where have you been?

01:09:45.114 --> 01:09:46.849
We need to get out of here! Now!

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:59.495
- Pap!
- Wors, slow down!

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:01.463
Pap, where are you?

01:10:05.534 --> 01:10:06.569
Pap!

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:19.882
Hurry up!
2-Bit, come on!

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:28.557
There they are!

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:36.765
No, no, no, no, no...

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:42.271
It's Pap.

01:10:51.547 --> 01:10:53.849
The fuck?

01:10:53.849 --> 01:10:54.817
Jesus!

01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.722
Wors...

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:03.726
I love you, brother.

01:11:10.299 --> 01:11:11.667
I'm sorry, my friend.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.404
He's gone.

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:19.742
Fuck!

01:11:20.442 --> 01:11:21.610
I'm tripping out!

01:11:24.113 --> 01:11:26.582
Um, Pap, how are you...

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:29.385
What?

01:11:30.019 --> 01:11:30.986
Is it bad?

01:11:31.587 --> 01:11:34.323
- It's, uh...
- It's not great.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:38.494
I-- I'm pretty sure
you can just tuck it...

01:11:39.061 --> 01:11:41.263
Don't do that,
don't do that, don't do that!

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:49.305
I got an idea!

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.444
2-Bit, hurry up!

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.418
We're leaving!

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:19.835
2-Bit you're my Wookiee!

01:12:21.503 --> 01:12:24.606
I don't know
what I'm shooting at!

01:12:27.109 --> 01:12:29.978
Move! Move!

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:40.789
Come on, let's go!

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:42.624
Where we going?

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:44.193
We're raiding the City Hall.

01:12:44.426 --> 01:12:45.728
It's cool,
they're with us!

01:12:45.728 --> 01:12:46.662
This way!

01:12:49.431 --> 01:12:51.934
2-Bit, let's go!
We're going to the City Hall!

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:54.303
Wait, 2-Bit,
my balls are hurting.

01:12:57.639 --> 01:13:00.809
I have reduced
the number of homeless people

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:03.512
in this city to basically zero.

01:13:04.913 --> 01:13:06.982
Thank you. Thank you.

01:13:07.783 --> 01:13:10.319
You'll never again
have to see another home--

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:23.165
Fuck!

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:53.796
Come on!

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:03.138
Keep moving!

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:07.643
...polluting the streets

01:14:07.976 --> 01:14:10.045
of our beautiful city
ever again.

01:14:14.650 --> 01:14:17.052
Go, I'll take it from here.

01:14:18.554 --> 01:14:19.922
Are you sure?

01:14:23.225 --> 01:14:24.460
Let's move!

01:14:28.664 --> 01:14:30.833
And I promise that--

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.237
What the fuck is that?

01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:40.509
Down with
the fucking government!

01:14:40.509 --> 01:14:42.478
Now, just everybody calm down!

01:14:43.078 --> 01:14:46.515
We don't want this party
turning into a massacre!

01:14:46.515 --> 01:14:48.116
Massacre sounds good to me!

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.654
What the fuck is this?

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:55.657
Shoot the fuckers!

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:57.025
Kill them all!

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:19.648
Keep moving forward!

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.085
Put your mask on!

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:38.600
Go, go, go!

01:16:01.857 --> 01:16:03.992
- The fucker's getting away!
- Let's move!

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:07.362
Let's kill that cunt!

01:16:43.932 --> 01:16:45.601
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:16:46.101 --> 01:16:47.102
You let me go now,

01:16:47.536 --> 01:16:49.037
I promise, no repercussions.

01:16:49.504 --> 01:16:51.239
Water under the bridge.
Think about it.

01:16:52.107 --> 01:16:53.475
What have you
actually achieved, huh?

01:16:53.976 --> 01:16:56.345
Nothing!
Everybody still hates you!

01:16:56.979 --> 01:16:58.880
You're still
the lowest of the low.

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:02.184
You pieces of shit!

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:04.853
You... you filthy fucking hobos!

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.089
You're goddamn street trash!

01:17:07.856 --> 01:17:10.926
No, no, no...

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:02.678
It's over.

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:06.948
Alex...

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:10.218
no matter where you go,

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:12.087
there you are.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:19.828
Oy vey!

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:27.969
Street trash...

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:32.074
Filthy trash...

01:18:32.574 --> 01:18:34.509
I'm the fucking mayor.

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:37.846
You're gonna have to
suck my di--

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:48.190
People were shouting
and screaming and vomiting.

01:18:48.190 --> 01:18:50.225
Like they've never seen
a meat sock before.

01:18:50.792 --> 01:18:53.295
And that's why
they call me Sockle.

01:18:54.362 --> 01:18:56.998
- Come on, let's go.
- Not this time, kid.

01:18:57.599 --> 01:18:59.034
Sockle's gotta go now.

01:18:59.034 --> 01:19:01.536
Gotta sow my wild oats
with all the other boys

01:19:01.536 --> 01:19:02.571
and girls out there.

01:19:03.004 --> 01:19:06.108
- So many holes, so many people.
- Why do you have to go?

01:19:06.108 --> 01:19:08.110
I've taught you
everything I know, 2-Bit.

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:09.578
My work is done here.

01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:13.148
But if you ever need me,
you know where to find me.

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:30.532
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:58.126
This bullet's
really starting to hurt now.

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:02.697
