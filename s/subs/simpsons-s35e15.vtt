Can you believe this guy?

09:39.562 --> 09:40.561
Larry's not here!

09:40.622 --> 09:41.638
He's dead!

09:41.656 --> 09:42.914
His ghost is here.

09:43.066 --> 09:43.915
Aw, come on, Lenny.

09:44.067 --> 09:45.325
Ghosts ain't real, huh?

09:45.477 --> 09:46.659
Yes, they are.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.813
I believe that Larry's ghost
is hovering above us,

09:49.831 --> 09:51.572
blowing out birthday candles,

09:51.592 --> 09:54.167
<i> helping figure skaters</i>
<i> land their jumps</i>

09:54.319 --> 09:57.837
<i> and cooling down hot soup</i>
<i>with his icy cold ghost finger.</i>

09:57.931 --> 09:59.839
Lenny, Lenny, Lenny.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.158
Everybody knows
that when you die,

10:02.251 --> 10:04.436
your soul becomes cosmic energy,

10:04.663 --> 10:06.679
<i> until your consciousness</i>
<i> is reborn</i>

10:06.832 --> 10:10.091
<i> as a creature that befits</i>
<i> your metaphysical station,</i>

10:10.110 --> 10:11.517
<i> be it mighty moose</i>

10:11.594 --> 10:13.469
<i> or a proud paramecium.</i>

10:13.521 --> 10:15.429
Shut your traps,
you deluded freaks.

10:15.523 --> 10:17.115
Here's the deal--
when you croak,

10:17.266 --> 10:19.175
it's just a sad, silent void.

10:19.194 --> 10:21.511
Nothin'. And it's not even
a regular nothin'.

10:21.646 --> 10:23.363
It's an absence
of everything, huh?

10:23.515 --> 10:25.290
Where no matter
how hard you think,

10:25.441 --> 10:28.109
you can't imagine
how<i> nothin'</i> it is.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.444
Like that abandoned mall
where the JC Pennys

10:30.538 --> 10:31.871
is full of bears?

10:32.023 --> 10:32.872
No.

10:33.024 --> 10:34.524
[scoffs]
You're all wrong.

10:34.542 --> 10:37.026
Why have questions
when we have the Bible?

10:37.045 --> 10:39.045
I didn't serve
20 years to life in church

10:39.139 --> 10:42.031
not to cash in on
those frequent prayer miles.

10:42.166 --> 10:43.791
I can't wait till I die

10:43.810 --> 10:45.477
<i>so I can slide in next to Larry</i>

10:45.628 --> 10:48.647
<i> and eat buffalo angel wings</i>
<i> for all eternity</i>

10:48.874 --> 10:51.724
<i>without a celery stick in sight.</i>

10:51.818 --> 10:52.984
-Ghosts.
-Void.

10:53.211 --> 10:54.878
-Space moose.
-Wings.

10:54.971 --> 10:56.613
Don't listen to them,
ghost Larry.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.327
Void!

11:03.497 --> 11:05.705
First pee of the day.
Let's make it count.

11:06.983 --> 11:09.292
[mutters indistinctly]

11:10.504 --> 11:13.296
[yelps]
Larry, get back in your jar.

11:14.157 --> 11:16.082
What the hell is this?

11:16.234 --> 11:18.584
And this, and this.

11:18.737 --> 11:20.920
What parts of Larry were these?

11:21.072 --> 11:23.348
[groans unhappily]

11:24.409 --> 11:25.350
[whistling]

11:25.501 --> 11:28.061
Hey, Homer, what you doing
down there?

11:29.856 --> 11:32.098
Sweet Tabasco Sally,

11:32.250 --> 11:34.526
is thems what I think
thems is?

11:37.513 --> 11:38.530
Hmm.

11:38.757 --> 11:39.939
Sapphires.

11:40.091 --> 11:41.424
Larry's ashes were full of them.

11:41.443 --> 11:42.442
What gives?

11:42.536 --> 11:44.427
Larry must have had
these Smurf-stones

11:44.446 --> 11:46.946
crammed up his wazoo
when they crematized him.

11:47.098 --> 11:48.189
[pops]

11:48.208 --> 11:49.690
He must have been moving
stolen gems

11:49.784 --> 11:52.210
across the northern border
by stuffing them up

11:52.437 --> 11:54.270
his southern pass.
[laughs]

11:54.363 --> 11:57.774
All I knows is Larry is dead,
and we are rich.

11:57.792 --> 11:58.775
Oh, my God, you're right.

11:58.793 --> 12:00.960
We gotta tell Lenny and Carl.

12:01.112 --> 12:02.036
Uh, uh, real quick sidebar.

12:02.130 --> 12:04.538
Um, do we really want to bother

12:04.632 --> 12:05.782
our gentlemen friends

12:05.875 --> 12:09.285
with this here, uh,
gemalogical situation?

12:09.304 --> 12:11.378
-Why wouldn't we?
-Aw, bless your heart.

12:11.473 --> 12:14.899
But whatever money
these corpse jewels yield,

12:15.051 --> 12:17.718
we'd be crazy to split it
four ways.

12:17.812 --> 12:20.313
-[groans, grunts]
-[groans]

12:20.465 --> 12:22.073
Look, you and me
need this money

12:22.150 --> 12:23.891
way more than Lenny and Carl,
all right?

12:23.985 --> 12:25.392
You got an expensive
trophy wife

12:25.412 --> 12:26.986
and, like, a thousand
crazy kids.

12:27.063 --> 12:28.763
And all I got is a crummy bar

12:28.765 --> 12:30.640
full of toxic black mold.

12:30.733 --> 12:32.308
What?
[coughs]

12:32.327 --> 12:36.045
I guess I do have
a lot of financial burdens.

12:38.925 --> 12:41.000
-[knock on door]
-[Carl] Hey, open up.

12:41.152 --> 12:43.244
I gotta record my gum depth.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.413
Two, two, two, three, two...

12:46.433 --> 12:47.840
Okay, getting ready to lie
to our friends.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.434
And... showtime!

12:49.511 --> 12:52.103
Good morning, dearest Carlton.

12:52.330 --> 12:54.439
I know what's going on in here.

12:54.590 --> 12:56.257
-I, um...
-Uh, uh...

12:56.334 --> 12:58.443
You guys were getting up early

12:58.612 --> 13:00.945
to use the two free
continental breakfast vouchers

13:01.172 --> 13:02.338
without us.

13:02.357 --> 13:06.100
Well, we're using 'em.
Me and Larry.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.769
Don't worry,
we'll get our chance.

13:08.863 --> 13:10.163
[Moe hums greedily]

13:15.520 --> 13:18.037
Wait a sec, this ain't
the road to the Falls.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.613
Yeah, I took the scenic route.

13:19.633 --> 13:23.209
I thought Larry would appreciate
seeing those wildflowers.

13:23.361 --> 13:26.137
Guess who planted those.
Lady Bird Johnson.

13:26.289 --> 13:27.380
What the hell, Lenny?

13:27.532 --> 13:29.474
You know I gotta get back
to save<i> my</i> lady

13:29.625 --> 13:31.309
from the clutches of
Kool and the Gang.

13:31.386 --> 13:33.036
I thought you weren't worried.

13:33.054 --> 13:34.312
Of course I'm worried.

13:34.463 --> 13:38.041
They won the 2014<i> Soul Train</i>
Music Legend award.

13:38.059 --> 13:39.725
-Now let's get back
on the highway.
-[yelps]

13:39.894 --> 13:42.045
-[grunts] Give it!
-[tires screeching]

13:42.063 --> 13:43.563
[indistinct shouting]

13:43.715 --> 13:45.281
[both cry out]

13:52.148 --> 13:53.998
[tires screech]

13:56.728 --> 13:58.503
-Phew.
-[groaning] Oh...

13:58.654 --> 14:01.673
I'm sorry, Carl.
I'll get back on the highway.

14:01.749 --> 14:03.842
No. You go however you want.

14:04.027 --> 14:06.052
Let's do right by Larry.

14:12.577 --> 14:13.409
[both]
Larry!

14:13.428 --> 14:15.353
[Homer and Moe]
Our secret gems!

14:15.504 --> 14:16.563
[panting]

14:17.673 --> 14:19.098
Nothing to see here, huh?

14:19.192 --> 14:21.008
Just, uh,
crystalized Larry chunks.

14:21.027 --> 14:22.418
[whispering]
Gems. Gems, gems, gems.

14:22.511 --> 14:24.587
Gems. Gems, gems.
Precious gems.

14:24.606 --> 14:27.348
There were sapphires
in Larry's urn?

14:27.475 --> 14:28.441
And you knew?

14:28.535 --> 14:30.927
Look, guys, we can explain.
You see...

14:30.945 --> 14:32.612
Homer talked me into
screwing youse over

14:32.764 --> 14:34.931
so we could keep them gems
all for ourselves, all right?

14:34.933 --> 14:36.949
-[both] What?
-You liar!

14:37.043 --> 14:38.293
[sheriff]
Hands up.

14:39.662 --> 14:42.046
Back away from the urn.

14:45.034 --> 14:46.867
Y'all are under arrest
for violating

14:46.887 --> 14:50.371
section 545 of
the U.S. commerce code:

14:50.465 --> 14:51.797
jewel smuggling.

14:51.950 --> 14:52.873
[whimpering]

14:53.042 --> 14:55.709
Y'all get in the frunk.

14:55.729 --> 14:56.978
[vehicle chirps]

15:01.809 --> 15:03.793
[all mutter indistinctly]

15:03.811 --> 15:07.130
[Homer]
<i> Oh, "front trunk." Frunk.</i>

15:07.148 --> 15:08.648
<i> Now I get it.</i>

15:08.742 --> 15:10.366
[laughs, then cries]

15:14.247 --> 15:17.123
-[all groaning]
-[Lenny]<i> Oh.</i>

15:17.250 --> 15:18.474
[Lenny]
<i> I'm not going to jail</i>

15:18.493 --> 15:19.976
<i> 'cause you two were</i>
<i> gem smuggling.</i>

15:19.994 --> 15:21.586
It's worse than that, dummy.

15:21.813 --> 15:23.479
Homer and Moe weren't gonna
tell us about

15:23.498 --> 15:26.407
the sapphires they found
in the Larry crumbs.

15:26.501 --> 15:28.151
I wanted to tell you,
but Homer threatened

15:28.169 --> 15:29.410
to set my bar on fire.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.263
What? You told me
to keep the gems a secret,

15:32.340 --> 15:35.249
and I only listened to you
because I'm highly suggestable.

15:35.268 --> 15:37.936
-No, you're not.
-You're right, I'm not.

15:38.087 --> 15:40.179
Who cares? All I know is
we were the victims

15:40.331 --> 15:42.106
of an A-1 screw job.

15:42.258 --> 15:44.609
This is the worst thing
you guys have ever done.

15:44.760 --> 15:45.851
[Homer moans sadly]

15:45.928 --> 15:48.521
Oh. yeah, Carl?
Well, what about when you

15:48.673 --> 15:51.857
won a year's supply of
Old El Paso taco kits,

15:52.010 --> 15:53.676
and never invited me over?

15:53.695 --> 15:54.953
You won that contest?

15:55.104 --> 15:56.955
I wrote the taco poem.

15:57.106 --> 15:59.440
You must have submitted it
as yours.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.684
Maybe I just got tired
of hearing your voice

16:01.703 --> 16:04.128
that sounds like a duck
with a sinus infection.

16:04.280 --> 16:07.966
"The box contains seasoning
and five broken shells.

16:08.134 --> 16:12.545
You and your family buy
everything else. Old El Paso."

16:12.697 --> 16:13.972
He does sound like a duck.

16:14.199 --> 16:15.456
Now I'll never not hear it.

16:15.550 --> 16:17.717
You knew broken shells
are my thing.

16:17.869 --> 16:20.061
[all grunting]

16:23.466 --> 16:26.133
Is this what we're like
when we're... sober?

16:26.152 --> 16:28.878
We're nothing like
the<i> Sex and the City</i> broads.

16:28.896 --> 16:31.564
You take us out of that bar,
and what's holding us together?

16:31.658 --> 16:32.882
Nothing.

16:32.900 --> 16:35.309
And to think all Larry wanted
out of life

16:35.403 --> 16:37.978
was to be part of
this friend group.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.998
What a dumb dead chump.

16:40.225 --> 16:42.058
[sheriff]
Hey, boss, I found the idiots

16:42.151 --> 16:44.335
who took Larry's last haul.

16:44.487 --> 16:48.564
They're just a bunch of losers
that hate each other. Heh.

16:48.657 --> 16:50.008
It's all taken care of.

16:50.193 --> 16:53.344
Excellent work,
Mickey No-Loose-Ends.

16:53.496 --> 16:55.404
So what you want me
to do with them?

16:55.498 --> 16:57.073
Mm, let them go.

16:57.091 --> 16:58.850
They know nothing.

16:59.077 --> 17:01.686
Got it. No loose ends.

17:04.098 --> 17:06.507
Ugh, I gotta pay more attention
to the nicknames

17:06.526 --> 17:08.008
when I hire these guys.

17:08.102 --> 17:10.770
Now, can you go pick up Connie
at the airport,

17:10.922 --> 17:12.179
Bruno Wife-Banger?

17:12.198 --> 17:14.090
Hey, with pleasure.

17:14.183 --> 17:16.701
[whistling]

17:16.852 --> 17:18.352
[sheriff]
No loose ends.

17:18.446 --> 17:21.614
This psycho ain't a sheriff.
He's a psycho!

17:21.766 --> 17:23.541
Oh, and we're his loose ends.

17:23.692 --> 17:25.025
We're all gonna die.

17:25.194 --> 17:28.713
Oh, what if Lenny's right,
and we're all gonna be ghosts?

17:28.864 --> 17:31.215
What if Moe is right,
and it's just a void?

17:31.367 --> 17:33.200
Incomprehensible nothing.

17:33.294 --> 17:35.219
I don't think
I could handle that.

17:35.446 --> 17:37.947
No, no, no, Homer's heaven
makes sense to me now.

17:37.965 --> 17:40.449
Hey, Lord, I repent
everything I ever done.

17:40.584 --> 17:44.044
That he knows about.
Heh, heh, heh.

17:44.064 --> 17:47.231
Guys, I think Carl's
stupid energy crap is real,

17:47.458 --> 17:49.975
and I'm totally coming back
as one of those koalas

17:50.128 --> 17:52.295
with an STD.

17:52.388 --> 17:54.322
[grunting]

18:00.729 --> 18:02.805
Mm? [grunts]

18:02.824 --> 18:04.898
Hey, hey, look at this.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.251
I could blast him
when he opens the frunk.

18:07.478 --> 18:10.088
-[indistinct chatter]
-That flare gun.
Flare gun will save us.

18:10.239 --> 18:12.423
Time to get out. Whoa!

18:12.575 --> 18:14.500
Eat flare, jerk.

18:14.652 --> 18:16.344
[all crying out]

18:18.765 --> 18:19.672
Phew.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.099
[car creaking]

18:21.175 --> 18:23.584
[all cry out]

18:23.678 --> 18:26.512
Nobody move. As long as
our weight is balanced,

18:26.664 --> 18:27.847
we're not going over.

18:27.999 --> 18:29.923
Although,
if one of us jumped out,

18:29.943 --> 18:31.183
that person would
save themselves,

18:31.336 --> 18:32.926
and everyone else would die.

18:32.946 --> 18:35.504
So any one of us
could save themselves

18:35.598 --> 18:36.781
and doom the rest?

18:36.932 --> 18:38.765
[all]
No!

18:38.785 --> 18:41.510
[car creaking]

18:41.529 --> 18:44.680
Our only hope is to jump out
at the exact same time.

18:44.699 --> 18:45.939
Either we all survive,

18:45.959 --> 18:47.792
or we all find out
what the afterlife is...

18:47.943 --> 18:49.869
together.

18:50.021 --> 18:50.962
Unless it's the void,
in which case

18:51.113 --> 18:52.371
we won't find out nothin'.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.873
Okay, on three.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.616
One, two...

18:55.635 --> 18:57.301
[all]
Three!

18:57.953 --> 18:59.470
-Yay, we did it.
-Whoo!

18:59.697 --> 19:02.198
You don't jump on three.
You jump on "go."

19:02.216 --> 19:03.866
