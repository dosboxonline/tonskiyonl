I just found her there.

I swear, I don't even know her name.
I never seen her 'fore.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.931
We caught a body
over here at the Munsons' trailer.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.726
I don't even know how to describe it.

05:09.809 --> 05:12.770

05:13.271 --> 05:15.940
Uh, look… [breath quavering]

05:16.024 --> 05:17.775
…I need you down here ASAP

05:17.859 --> 05:20.945
to tell me what the hell I'm looking at,

05:21.696 --> 05:24.699
or how someone
could even do something like this.

[bright, upbeat music playing]

05:48.973 --> 05:49.807
Mike.

Ah!

05:51.976 --> 05:53.478
[Eleven chuckles happily]

05:55.188 --> 05:58.816
[Mike] Oh, careful, careful, careful.
You're squishing your present.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.234
It's a gift.

06:00.318 --> 06:03.821
I, uh-- I handpicked those
for you in Hawkins.

06:03.905 --> 06:07.617
I know you like yellow, but now
I'm realizing it's too much yellow.

06:07.700 --> 06:10.078
I know you also like purple,
so I got purple as well.

06:10.161 --> 06:12.747
So I kinda did, like,
a 70/30 split kinda thing.

06:12.830 --> 06:14.874
-They're perfect. Thank you.
-Oh. Oh!

06:14.957 --> 06:16.626
Hey. How you doing?

06:18.586 --> 06:19.796
-Hey, Mike.
-How you doing?

06:19.879 --> 06:20.797
Yeah, good, man.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.632
Great. Uh, what's that?

06:23.466 --> 06:26.636
Um, it's nothing.
Just this painting I've been working on.

06:26.719 --> 06:27.804
Cool.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.182
That's a rad shirt, man.

06:31.265 --> 06:32.225
Ocean Pacific?

06:32.308 --> 06:34.727
Oh, hey, Mike.
This is, uh, my friend Argyle.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.187
Oh. Hey.

06:38.731 --> 06:39.941
Oh no, no, no.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.777
No, it's a shitty knockoff. Yeah.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.947
But don't sweat it.
I'll get you the good threads out here.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.242
I heard a lot about your sister.

06:50.326 --> 06:51.327
[Jonathan] Uh.

06:52.829 --> 06:55.456
[Jonathan clears throat]
O-Okay. Um, should we go?

06:55.540 --> 06:57.208
Yeah, this is kinda awkward, man.

06:57.291 --> 06:59.335
Yeah, so awkward.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.463
-[upbeat surfer music playing]
-I really thought it was Ocean Pacific.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.465
[Eleven] I have our whole day planned.

07:04.549 --> 07:07.135
First, El Rodeo for burritos.

07:07.218 --> 07:09.387
What, really? Burritos for breakfast?

07:09.470 --> 07:10.555
Yes. Trust me.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.474
Yeah, no, I… I trust you.
It's just, you know, a little weird.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.102
Then, after burritos,
I want to go to Rink-O-Mania.

07:16.185 --> 07:18.354
Rink-O-Mania, okay.
What's Rink-O-Mania?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.356
It's the most fun place in Lenora.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.191
They have skating and games.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.527
Sounds awesome.
Are your friends gonna meet us?

07:24.610 --> 07:26.237
Friends? What… What friends?

07:26.320 --> 07:27.738
You know, Stacy and Angela.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.450
-Angela?
-You'll meet them, I promise.

07:30.533 --> 07:34.078
Just not today.
I want today to be about me and you.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.622
[upbeat surfer music intensifies]

07:44.464 --> 07:47.592
-Where to?
-4819 Lonzo Way.

07:48.551 --> 07:51.137
Let's go. This is life or death.
Snap, snap!

07:51.220 --> 07:52.263
[driver] Yes, sir.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.769
[synth pop music playing]

08:01.147 --> 08:04.442
Then Vicki laughed. And it wasn't
like a cheap, fake laugh either.

08:04.525 --> 08:07.361
It was like… It was a real, genuine laugh.

08:07.445 --> 08:09.780
Of course.
It's my Muppet joke. It's hilarious.

08:09.864 --> 08:13.576
My point is that Vicki laughed
and everything was just like…

08:13.659 --> 08:15.328
-It was perfect.
-But?

08:15.411 --> 08:18.915
But I'm having this problem
where it's like, I should stop talking.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.209
I have said everything I need to say.

08:21.292 --> 08:24.587
But then I guess I get nervous,
and the words keep spilling out,

08:24.670 --> 08:27.089
and it's like my… my brain
is moving faster than my mouth,

08:27.173 --> 08:29.467
or… or rather my… my mouth
is moving faster than my brain.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.052
I'm digging this hole for myself,

08:31.135 --> 08:33.513
and I want to stop digging,
I'm trying to stop, but I can't.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.598
And I'm doing it right now, aren't I?

08:36.140 --> 08:37.225
Yeah, you are.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.309
[Robin exhales]

08:39.769 --> 08:40.853
Oh, I'm hopeless.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.396
[Steve] Eh.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.315
We both are.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.569
If only we could just, like, combine.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.113
Combine?

08:51.197 --> 08:52.573
No, think about it.

08:53.074 --> 08:56.452
I know exactly what I want,
and I've found the girl of my dreams,

08:56.536 --> 08:58.579
but I can't get the courage
to ask her out.

08:58.663 --> 09:01.582
-Mm.
-Meanwhile, you go on a million dates.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.168
-And you have no idea what you want.
-Mm-hmm.

09:04.252 --> 09:08.005
So if we just combined,
all our problems would be solved.

09:08.089 --> 09:10.591
Because, I mean, alone, let's face it…

09:10.675 --> 09:11.842
We totally suck.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.344
Totally and utterly.

09:13.427 --> 09:15.763
[gasps] Ooh, I think
I found our morning movie.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.811
Ugh, you know I don't do double VHS.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.312
But it's about doomed love.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.523
-Oh, well, that's relatable.
-Precisely.

09:25.606 --> 09:29.735

is b-b-bonkers hot in this.

[reporter] We're in the Forest Hills
trailer park in east Roane County.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.745
We don't have a lot of details now,
but we can confirm

09:39.829 --> 09:43.082
that the body of a Hawkins High student
was discovered early this morning.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.501
-Police have not released the name…
-Holy shit.

09:45.585 --> 09:49.130
…although we are told they're currently
in the process of notifying the family.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.266
[knocking at door]

10:00.349 --> 10:02.018
You all right in there, Sinclair?

10:02.518 --> 10:03.519
[Lucas] I'm good.

[reporter] …occurred here is sure to touch
a nerve across the community of Hawkins,

10:16.115 --> 10:19.660

from last year's devastating mall fire.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.383
-[boy 2] Yo, just hit it.
-Yeah.

10:34.467 --> 10:36.010
But whatever has occurred…

10:36.802 --> 10:38.929
-[boy 2] Piece of shit.
-There you go. See?

10:39.013 --> 10:41.349
…is newly appointed police chief
Calvin Powell,

10:41.432 --> 10:43.643
who served as deputy under Chief Hopper.

10:43.726 --> 10:46.395
What's this?
I thought we were watching ThunderCats.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.439
Hawkins student got murdered.

10:48.522 --> 10:49.357
What?

10:49.440 --> 10:51.192
Yeah, it's on every channel.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.321
As you can see behind me, Chief Powell
and the Hawkins Police Department

10:55.404 --> 10:57.406
are actively investigating the scene…

10:58.032 --> 10:59.200
They say who it is?

10:59.283 --> 11:00.493
No, not yet.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.412
Hey, maybe Chrissy
didn't stand you up after all. [chuckles]

11:03.496 --> 11:05.164
Hey, don't say that.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.083
-[distant sirens]
-[boy 1] Relax, it was a joke.

11:07.166 --> 11:11.087
[boy 2] A joke? Come on, someone just died
and you're making a joke out of it?

11:11.170 --> 11:12.672
[boy 1] It was at the trailer park,

11:12.755 --> 11:15.174
so probably some druggy
OD'd on heroin or some shit.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.259
[boy 2] Oh, see, that makes it funnier.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.137
[boy 1] What is up your ass this morning?
It was a joke.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.432
[suspenseful music playing]

11:32.650 --> 11:35.653
[reporter] We also don't yet know
if foul play was involved.

11:35.736 --> 11:37.446
But whatever has occurred here

11:37.530 --> 11:40.116
is sure to touch a nerve across Hawkins.

11:40.199 --> 11:43.160
[woman] Ever since that girl, Barb,
died a few years ago,

11:43.244 --> 11:45.788
it has been one thing after another.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.667
I'll tell ya, you start to believe
all those things they say,

11:49.750 --> 11:51.627
that this town is cursed,

11:51.711 --> 11:54.130
that the devil lives here in Hawkins.

[Demogorgon snarls]

care about the basketball game anymore.

Nancy?

12:01.762 --> 12:03.097
-Earth to Nancy.
-What?

12:03.180 --> 12:05.683
I said I don't think anyone's
gonna care about the game.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.560
Yeah. No, I know.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.063
Would you be up for a field trip?

12:12.314 --> 12:15.484
[mysterious music playing]

12:31.167 --> 12:34.295
[reporter] Many of the residents
we spoke to voiced similar concerns to us.

12:34.378 --> 12:38.340
Grief, shock, disbelief, anger.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.384
Everyone wants to know the same thing,

12:40.468 --> 12:43.846
how can so many tragedies
befall a once-peaceful town?

12:44.930 --> 12:47.683
All eyes are now
on the police for answers.

12:47.767 --> 12:51.061
Is the new chief of police, Powell,
in over his head?

12:51.145 --> 12:53.522
Or is he the very savior this town needs?

12:53.606 --> 12:56.358
We'll be here the rest of the day
right here on channel nine,

12:56.442 --> 12:59.361
where we'll keep you posted
on all the latest developments.

12:59.445 --> 13:03.908
In the meantime, we recommend you
keep your doors and windows locked tight.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.131
[Dustin] Chrissy Cunningham?

13:19.215 --> 13:20.466
You're sure it was Chrissy?

13:20.549 --> 13:24.512
Yes, in her cheerleader outfit. Same thing
she was in when I saw her with Eddie.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.680
-Did you tell all this to the cops?
-No.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.266
No, but I… I can't be the only one
who saw them together.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.476
They stood out.

13:30.559 --> 13:33.395
Eddie the freak
with Chrissy the cheerleader?

13:33.479 --> 13:36.690
Exactly. You know, his name's not
in the news yet or anything,

13:36.774 --> 13:39.151
but I guarantee you
Eddie is suspect one now.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.694
That's crazy.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.655
Eddie didn't do this. No way.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.615
No way.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.492
-We can't rule it out.
-Yes, we can.

13:46.575 --> 13:48.744
-Dustin!
-You don't know him like I do, Max.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.037
Okay?

13:50.120 --> 13:53.541
When we got to high school,
Lucas made all his sports friends.

13:53.624 --> 13:54.583
Mike and me?

13:55.125 --> 13:57.253
I mean, no one was nice to us.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.296

51:04.853 --> 51:07.439
You think you know
who might've done this?

51:10.650 --> 51:12.110
You ever hear the name

51:13.612 --> 51:14.780
Victor Creel?

51:15.739 --> 51:17.741
[ominous music intensifies]

51:21.787 --> 51:25.916
[Wayne] I guess you're too young,
but back when I was a kid,

51:25.999 --> 51:29.086
everybody knew the name Victor Creel.

51:29.586 --> 51:31.630
He lost his mind.

51:32.881 --> 51:34.299
Killed his whole family.

51:34.382 --> 51:35.884
Kids and wife.

51:36.551 --> 51:38.053
Took their eyes.

51:39.346 --> 51:40.514
Cut 'em right out.

51:41.890 --> 51:42.808
God.

51:42.891 --> 51:44.267
[clock continues chiming]

51:44.351 --> 51:46.561
[Wayne] That poor girl
I found this morning,

51:47.187 --> 51:49.189
same exact thing.

51:50.065 --> 51:51.149
So I'm thinking

51:51.817 --> 51:53.068
maybe he broke out.

51:54.611 --> 51:55.987
Victor Creel is still alive?

51:56.071 --> 51:59.241
They locked him away in Pennhurst Asylum.

51:59.324 --> 52:02.035
Yeah, as far as I know, he's still there.

52:02.119 --> 52:04.121
That is, unless he broke out.

52:05.330 --> 52:09.126
Like that… What's his name?
White mask and killed the babysitters?

52:09.209 --> 52:10.127
[chimes]

52:10.210 --> 52:11.628
[Nancy] Michael Myers?

52:11.711 --> 52:14.381
-[clock ticking]
-[Wayne] Yeah, Michael Myers.

52:14.881 --> 52:17.008
-[ticking]
-You ask me, Victor's like that.

52:18.426 --> 52:20.137
He's a real boogeyman.

52:20.720 --> 52:21.721
[wind rushing]

52:24.683 --> 52:26.351
[dog barks, whimpers]

52:29.729 --> 52:31.982
Um, I'll be right back.

52:32.566 --> 52:34.568
[dog continues barking, whimpering]

52:40.740 --> 52:41.783
Fred?

52:43.952 --> 52:44.911
Fred!

52:47.330 --> 52:48.498
Fred!

52:52.127 --> 52:53.086
Fred?

52:55.672 --> 52:56.631
Fred?

52:58.967 --> 53:02.429
[sinister music swells]

53:02.512 --> 53:04.514
[chiming, ticking]

53:14.608 --> 53:16.610
[muffled weeping]

53:32.083 --> 53:34.878
[flesh distending wetly]

53:35.670 --> 53:36.880
Murderer.

53:36.963 --> 53:38.548
Murderer!

53:38.632 --> 53:40.717
-Murderer. Murderer!
-Murderer.

53:40.800 --> 53:42.385
Murderer.

53:43.053 --> 53:48.975
[all chanting] Murderer! Murderer!
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

53:50.352 --> 53:52.229
Murderer! Murderer!

53:54.064 --> 53:56.399
-Murderer!
-[Fred panting]

53:59.194 --> 54:01.196
[clippers buzzing]

54:07.911 --> 54:10.330
[ominous music playing]

54:15.001 --> 54:17.420
[man in Russian] You are no longer men.

54:19.631 --> 54:21.466
You are cogs in a machine.

54:21.549 --> 54:25.845
A machine in service
of our great Motherland.

54:29.140 --> 54:32.185
And if you are foolish enough
to attempt escape,

54:33.853 --> 54:35.730
you will be hunted down.

54:37.274 --> 54:38.692
You will be captured.

54:39.567 --> 54:42.028
And then you will suffer greatly

54:42.112 --> 54:44.781
as you perform your final act

54:44.864 --> 54:46.533
for the Motherland.

54:47.117 --> 54:49.995
There will be no second chances.

54:54.207 --> 54:55.083
[in English] Run,

54:55.709 --> 54:56.543
you die.

54:57.585 --> 54:59.337
You hear, American?

55:02.882 --> 55:05.510
[Enzo on tape] Your friend is… stuck.

55:06.094 --> 55:09.264
But you get me money, I make him unstuck.

55:09.764 --> 55:10.807
You must trust me.

55:10.890 --> 55:12.309
[Joyce on tape] How do I trust--

55:12.392 --> 55:15.770
Joyce, whoever Enzo is,
the answer is not on that tape.

55:15.854 --> 55:18.106
[woman speaking Russian
indistinctly on tape]

55:18.606 --> 55:20.734
[in English] You don't hear that?
In the background?

55:20.817 --> 55:22.694
So he's outside.

55:22.777 --> 55:24.988
Someone's talking. Not surprising.

55:26.531 --> 55:28.158
I think she's talking to Enzo.

55:29.492 --> 55:30.493
Play it again.

55:33.121 --> 55:35.498
[woman speaking Russian
indistinctly on tape]

55:37.000 --> 55:38.710
[in English] Can you translate that?

55:38.793 --> 55:41.546
Uh, I… I can't understand it.
It's too low.

55:44.674 --> 55:46.676
[dramatic music playing]

55:50.805 --> 55:52.557
[alarm buzzing]

55:52.640 --> 55:53.767
[men speaking Russian]

55:58.021 --> 55:59.898
[metallic clanging]

56:00.607 --> 56:01.775
[in English] Hey!

56:01.858 --> 56:03.193
[men chattering in Russian]

56:05.028 --> 56:07.447
[Enzo in English] But you get me
money, I make him unstuck.

56:07.530 --> 56:09.449
-Turn it up.
-You must trust me.

56:09.532 --> 56:12.285
[Joyce on tape] How do I trust you?
I don't know who you are.

56:13.119 --> 56:15.538
She… She wants to use the phone.

56:16.039 --> 56:17.332
She's mad at Enzo.

56:17.415 --> 56:18.583
[speaking Russian]

56:18.666 --> 56:20.293
-Calls him a "moosor."
-"Moosor"?

56:20.377 --> 56:21.378
-It's slang.
-For what?

56:22.504 --> 56:26.007
[Murray] Literally, "moosor" translates
to trash or garbage.

56:26.091 --> 56:28.051
Like "pig" here, often directed at cops.

56:28.134 --> 56:29.636
Cops?

56:34.349 --> 56:35.725
Or guards.

56:41.106 --> 56:43.024
Hopper's stuck.

56:43.108 --> 56:44.025
[Hopper grunts]

56:45.235 --> 56:49.322
And Enzo can get him unstuck.

56:50.198 --> 56:53.368
[Enzo] Yeah.
It's not exactly the Ritz, is it?

56:56.704 --> 56:59.666
Welcome to your new home, American.

57:04.087 --> 57:05.630
Enzo's a prison guard.

57:05.713 --> 57:07.715
Maybe Hopper bribed him.

57:07.799 --> 57:09.426
Sounds like Jim, doesn't it?

57:10.009 --> 57:11.136
[chuckles]

57:13.263 --> 57:15.056
-Joyce, where are you going?
-Bank.

57:15.140 --> 57:17.725
I'm gonna get Enzo his damn money,

57:18.518 --> 57:20.728
and we are getting Hopper back.

57:21.646 --> 57:22.605
Okay.

57:22.689 --> 57:24.399
[suspenseful music builds to climax]

57:24.482 --> 57:25.692
El?

57:25.775 --> 57:27.360
What the hell? Get out!

57:28.820 --> 57:30.196
-Not there?
-No.

57:30.280 --> 57:33.575
-Should've told me she was having trouble.
-I didn't know they were gonna be here.

57:33.658 --> 57:36.453
You knew she was having trouble for a year
and didn't tell me.

57:36.536 --> 57:39.664
-I didn't know she was lying to you.
-Which is why you were a douche all day?

57:39.747 --> 57:41.749
-I wasn't being a douche.
-You were.

57:41.833 --> 57:45.336
You were rolling your eyes, moping.
You were barely talking.

57:45.420 --> 57:48.548
-You basically sabotaged the whole day.
-She was lying to you.

57:48.631 --> 57:51.176
Straight to your face,
ever since you got here.

57:51.259 --> 57:54.804
And I've been a total third wheel all day.
It's been miserable.

57:54.888 --> 57:58.183
So, sorry if I wasn't… wasn't smiling.

57:59.309 --> 58:00.310
Yeah, whatever, man.

58:03.146 --> 58:04.772
Well, what about us?

58:04.856 --> 58:05.857
What?

58:06.441 --> 58:08.359
You're mad that I didn't talk to you?

58:09.110 --> 58:12.655
You made it super clear that you're
not interested in anything I have to say.

58:12.739 --> 58:15.783
-That's just not true.
-You've called maybe a couple times.

58:15.867 --> 58:17.535
It's been a year, Mike.

58:17.619 --> 58:19.954
Meanwhile, El has
a book of letters from you.

58:20.038 --> 58:22.540
-That's because she's my girlfriend, Will.
-And us?

58:22.624 --> 58:24.334
We're friends. We're friends.

58:24.417 --> 58:26.002
We used to be best friends.

58:26.085 --> 58:27.879
[emotional synth music playing]

58:27.962 --> 58:30.715
Then maybe you should've
reached out more. I don't know.

58:30.798 --> 58:32.300
But why is this on me?

58:32.383 --> 58:33.885
Why… Why am I the bad guy?

58:39.724 --> 58:42.560
[sighs] Let's just…
Let's just find her. Okay?

58:46.147 --> 58:47.565
[sighs]

58:56.824 --> 58:58.868
[weeping softly]

59:11.464 --> 59:12.966
[Angela, bullies laughing]

59:13.049 --> 59:14.217
[bully] Yeah.

59:30.984 --> 59:33.027
-[Angela] Oh my God, her face.
-[bully 1] Right?

59:33.111 --> 59:35.154
-She looks like she shit herself.
-Yeah.

59:47.417 --> 59:49.168
[bullies chuckling]

59:49.252 --> 59:50.086
Angela.

59:51.337 --> 59:53.923
-Uh-oh. Look who it is.
-[bully 1] She looks upset.

59:54.007 --> 59:55.425
You ruined my day.

59:55.508 --> 59:59.137
[chuckles] Oh no. Did we embarrass you
in front of your boyfriend?

59:59.220 --> 1:00:01.389
I want you to say sorry to me,

1:00:01.472 --> 1:00:05.393
and I want you to tell my boyfriend
that it was just a joke

1:00:05.476 --> 1:00:07.437
and that we are really friends.

1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:08.521
Or what?

1:00:09.188 --> 1:00:11.399
You gonna hurt us
with your mean stare again?

1:00:12.317 --> 1:00:15.820
[Angela giggles]

1:00:15.903 --> 1:00:18.364
Sorry you can't cry to teacher today.

1:00:18.448 --> 1:00:21.075
You'll just have to cry
to your daddy instead.

1:00:21.159 --> 1:00:23.828
Oh, wait. Can't do that either.

1:00:23.911 --> 1:00:25.872
[bully 1 scoffs cruelly]

Angela.

1:00:51.230 --> 1:00:52.940
Holy shit. Angela, you okay?

1:00:53.024 --> 1:00:55.151
-Angela, hey. You okay?
-[bystander 1] Oh my God!

1:00:56.486 --> 1:00:58.112
-[bystander 2] What did she do?
-Oh my God.

1:00:58.196 --> 1:01:00.031
-Oh my God, what do we do?
-Oh, shit.

1:01:00.114 --> 1:01:01.324
[Angela shrieks]

1:01:01.407 --> 1:01:02.784
[bully 1] You're okay. You're okay.

1:01:23.346 --> 1:01:24.472
Oh… Oh my God.

1:01:24.555 --> 1:01:25.723
Holy shit, El.

1:01:26.307 --> 1:01:27.308
What did you do?

1:01:28.851 --> 1:01:29.977
[echoing] What did you do?

1:01:30.061 --> 1:01:33.106

[doorbell rings rapidly]

1:02:04.762 --> 1:02:07.432
Okay. Well, that's settled.
I guess he's not here.

1:02:07.515 --> 1:02:09.726
-Eddie! It's Dustin!
-Great.

1:02:09.809 --> 1:02:11.018
[tense music playing]

1:02:11.102 --> 1:02:13.062
Look, we just wanna talk, okay?

1:02:13.146 --> 1:02:15.606
No cops, I swear. We just wanna help.

1:02:17.150 --> 1:02:18.067
Eddie!

Reefer Rick!

1:02:25.616 --> 1:02:27.118
[Steve] Don't scream that.

1:02:29.495 --> 1:02:31.289
-Rick!
-He's not there.

1:02:31.372 --> 1:02:33.458
-Reefer Rick!
-Just…

1:02:33.541 --> 1:02:35.251
He could just be really high.

1:02:36.294 --> 1:02:38.921
-[Steve] Is that a foot?
-[Dustin] No, that's a shoe.

1:02:39.005 --> 1:02:40.089
Hey, guys?

1:02:49.307 --> 1:02:51.309
[tense music intensifies]

1:03:10.787 --> 1:03:11.871
Hello?

1:03:13.790 --> 1:03:14.999
Is anyone home?

1:03:24.300 --> 1:03:25.384
What a dump.

1:03:44.737 --> 1:03:46.531
-[tense musical flourish]
-What are you doing?

1:03:48.032 --> 1:03:49.450
What are you doing?

1:03:49.534 --> 1:03:50.952
He might be in here.

1:03:52.495 --> 1:03:53.704
So take the tarp off.

1:03:53.788 --> 1:03:55.748
If you're so brave, you take the tarp off.

1:03:59.460 --> 1:04:02.588
[floorboards creaking]

1:04:03.673 --> 1:04:05.383
Hey, look over here.

1:04:08.553 --> 1:04:09.804
Someone was here.

1:04:09.887 --> 1:04:12.598
Maybe he heard us. Got spooked and ran.

1:04:13.224 --> 1:04:15.268
Don't worry.
Steve will get him with his oar.

1:04:15.351 --> 1:04:16.978
I know you think you're being funny,

1:04:17.061 --> 1:04:20.022
but considering everyone in this room
has nearly died a hundred times,

1:04:20.106 --> 1:04:22.316
personally, I don't find it funny
in the slight--

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:23.985
-[tense music intensifies]
-Whoa!

1:04:24.068 --> 1:04:25.570

Whoa, whoa, whoa, Eddie! Eddie! Stop!

1:04:30.241 --> 1:04:31.868
Eddie! Eddie!

1:04:33.160 --> 1:04:33.995
It's me.

1:04:34.620 --> 1:04:35.705
It's Dustin.

1:04:36.205 --> 1:04:37.415
This is Steve.

1:04:37.498 --> 1:04:41.252
He's not gonna hurt you, right, Steve?

1:04:41.335 --> 1:04:42.503
Right. Yeah.

1:04:42.587 --> 1:04:44.422
Steve, why don't you drop the oar?

1:04:47.174 --> 1:04:49.802
-[Steve groans]
-He's cool. He's cool.

1:04:49.886 --> 1:04:51.178
I'm cool, man. I'm cool.

-What are you doing here?
-We're looking for you.

1:04:53.931 --> 1:04:54.891
We're here to help.

1:04:55.474 --> 1:04:57.518
[Dustin] Eddie, these are my friends.

1:04:57.602 --> 1:05:00.897
-You know Robin, from band.
-[imitates playing instrument]

1:05:00.980 --> 1:05:03.024
[Dustin] This is my friend Max.

1:05:03.107 --> 1:05:05.192
The one who never wants to play D&amp;D.

1:05:06.068 --> 1:05:06.903
Eddie.

1:05:08.195 --> 1:05:10.197
We're on your side.

1:05:11.574 --> 1:05:13.075
I swear on my mother.

1:05:13.159 --> 1:05:15.369
-Right, guys?
-Yes. Yes. We swear.

1:05:15.453 --> 1:05:16.454
On Dustin's mother.

1:05:16.537 --> 1:05:18.414
Yeah, Dustin's… Dustin's mother.

Jesus Ch…

1:05:41.812 --> 1:05:42.730
Eddie…

1:05:45.983 --> 1:05:50.571
We just want to talk.

1:05:52.657 --> 1:05:53.574
Okay?

1:05:58.412 --> 1:05:59.914
We want to know what happened.

1:06:02.917 --> 1:06:04.835
[sniffs] You won't believe me.

1:06:07.296 --> 1:06:08.214
Try us.

1:06:14.553 --> 1:06:15.429
[Nancy] Fred!

1:06:17.723 --> 1:06:18.683
Fred!

1:06:21.560 --> 1:06:22.603
Excuse me.

1:06:23.562 --> 1:06:24.480
Hi.

1:06:24.981 --> 1:06:28.526
Excuse me, sorry.
Have you seen my friend wandering around?

1:06:28.609 --> 1:06:30.528
Uh, nerdy, glasses, scar on his face?

1:06:30.611 --> 1:06:31.779
[man] No, sorry.

[police radio squawks]

1:06:42.164 --> 1:06:43.457
Hi, officer?

1:06:43.541 --> 1:06:45.418
-Officer?
-What are you still doing here?

1:06:45.501 --> 1:06:48.504
My… My friend from the car earlier,
I… I can't find him.

1:06:48.587 --> 1:06:49.964
What do you mean?

1:06:50.047 --> 1:06:52.425
He was there
and then he was just gone and…

1:06:52.508 --> 1:06:55.261
Did you maybe see him
leave with somebody or…?

1:06:55.344 --> 1:06:57.930
I told you kids to go home. Jesus Christ.

1:06:58.014 --> 1:07:00.433
This is Glenn.
We might have a situation here.

-[breathes shakily]
-[crackling]

1:07:23.164 --> 1:07:24.999
[Eddie] Her body just, like,

1:07:25.082 --> 1:07:29.211
lifted up into the air and, uh…

1:07:31.756 --> 1:07:33.507
And she just, like, hung there.

1:07:34.258 --> 1:07:35.259
In the air.

1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:38.429
And her bones… Uh, she… [whimpers]

1:07:40.431 --> 1:07:43.267
Her bones started to snap.

1:07:43.350 --> 1:07:44.852
[bones cracking]

1:07:45.436 --> 1:07:46.604
Her eyes, man.

1:07:46.687 --> 1:07:48.981
It… It was like there was something,

1:07:49.065 --> 1:07:51.984
like, inside her head, pulling.

1:07:54.320 --> 1:07:57.073
I… I didn't know what to do, so I…

1:08:00.701 --> 1:08:01.660
I ran away.

1:08:04.246 --> 1:08:05.372
I left her there.

1:08:08.709 --> 1:08:11.921
[scoffs] You all think I'm crazy, right?

1:08:12.004 --> 1:08:14.381
No. We don't think you're crazy.

1:08:14.465 --> 1:08:17.384
Don't bullshit me, man!
I know how this sounds.

1:08:17.468 --> 1:08:19.512
-We're not bullshitting you.
-We believe you.

1:08:19.595 --> 1:08:20.596
[exhales]

1:08:21.430 --> 1:08:22.640
[Dustin] Look,

1:08:22.723 --> 1:08:24.892
what I'm about to tell you might be

1:08:24.975 --> 1:08:28.896
a little… difficult to take.

1:08:30.106 --> 1:08:31.357
Okay.

1:08:31.440 --> 1:08:33.818
You know how people say Hawkins is…

1:08:34.777 --> 1:08:35.694
cursed?

1:08:37.238 --> 1:08:38.280
They're not

1:08:39.406 --> 1:08:40.366
way off.

1:08:40.866 --> 1:08:43.410
[eerie music playing]

1:08:43.494 --> 1:08:44.870
[Dustin] There's another world.

1:08:44.954 --> 1:08:47.123
[echoing screams]

1:08:47.206 --> 1:08:50.501
[Dustin] A world hidden beneath Hawkins.

1:08:52.878 --> 1:08:56.632
Sometimes it bleeds into ours.

1:08:57.675 --> 1:08:59.301
Like ghosts and shit?

1:08:59.385 --> 1:09:00.845
There are some things

1:09:02.054 --> 1:09:03.556
worse than ghosts.

1:09:03.639 --> 1:09:05.474
-[glass shattering]

1:09:05.558 --> 1:09:08.644

1:09:23.659 --> 1:09:25.661
[panicked gasping]

1:09:32.585 --> 1:09:33.878
No, no, no…

1:09:33.961 --> 1:09:37.339
[Dustin] These monsters
from this other world…

1:09:37.423 --> 1:09:39.842
-Help! Somebody!
-…we thought they were gone.

1:09:39.925 --> 1:09:42.178
-Nancy, please!
-But they've come back before.

1:09:42.261 --> 1:09:43.846
That's why we needed to find you.

1:09:44.889 --> 1:09:47.892
If they're back again, we need to know.

1:09:48.684 --> 1:09:50.352
[sinister voice] Fred.

1:09:52.438 --> 1:09:55.024
[guttural growling]

1:09:57.026 --> 1:09:58.027
[Robin] That night,

1:09:58.944 --> 1:10:00.321
did you see anything?

1:10:00.404 --> 1:10:02.364
Dark particles, maybe?

1:10:06.785 --> 1:10:09.079
[creature growling]

1:10:09.163 --> 1:10:12.124
It would almost look like dust,
swirling dust.

1:10:12.208 --> 1:10:15.377
No, man, there was nothing
you could see or, uh…

1:10:17.004 --> 1:10:18.255
or touch.

1:10:18.339 --> 1:10:21.508
[snarling]

1:10:21.592 --> 1:10:24.178
[whimpering] What do you want?

1:10:29.558 --> 1:10:31.518
I want you

1:10:33.229 --> 1:10:34.980
to join me.

1:10:35.731 --> 1:10:37.900
No, no, no, no.

1:10:54.667 --> 1:10:56.877
[Eddie] You know,
I tried to wake her, man.

1:10:57.378 --> 1:10:58.796
She couldn't move.

1:11:00.047 --> 1:11:03.550
It was like she… she was
in a trance or something.

1:11:04.718 --> 1:11:06.136
Or under a spell.

1:11:07.137 --> 1:11:08.180
A curse.

1:11:08.764 --> 1:11:10.140
Vecna's curse.

1:11:12.810 --> 1:11:13.811
[bones cracking]

1:11:26.198 --> 1:11:27.199
Who's Vecna?

1:11:28.325 --> 1:11:33.080
An undead creature of great power.

1:11:34.415 --> 1:11:35.749
A spell caster.

1:11:36.959 --> 1:11:38.627
A dark wizard.
