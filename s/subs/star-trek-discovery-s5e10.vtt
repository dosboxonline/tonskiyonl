If one black hole loses mass,

it'll throw the entire area
into gravitational chaos.

31:01.337 --> 31:03.862

a gravity problem.

31:44.206 --> 31:45.947
Sir, the dreadnaught's
back in commission.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.254
It's heading directly
for Book and the portal.

31:48.254 --> 31:49.429
They're gonna beat us there.

31:49.429 --> 31:50.734
Can we jump ahead of them?

31:50.734 --> 31:52.127
Negative, there's still

31:52.127 --> 31:54.477

for us to land safely.

31:55.478 --> 31:59.265

33:48.983 --> 33:51.812
Primarch Tahal, I came here
because I believed

33:51.812 --> 33:53.466
you would have the courage

33:53.466 --> 33:56.164
to take a step toward a future
with the Federation,

33:56.164 --> 34:00.125
but you are just as cowardly as
our admirals believed you to be.

34:00.125 --> 34:03.389
We will leave now
knowing that truth.

34:05.695 --> 34:08.524
<i>No, Ambassador,
you will not leave.</i>

34:08.524 --> 34:10.178
<i>You have sealed your fate.</i>

34:10.178 --> 34:13.181
If you take my life
and continue this expedition,

34:13.181 --> 34:16.097
you will never claim
the throne of the Imperium.

34:16.097 --> 34:19.057
I may have arrived as
an emissary of the Federation,

34:19.057 --> 34:22.625
but I am Kelpien
first and foremost.

34:22.625 --> 34:25.628
My species are predators,

34:25.628 --> 34:27.674
and I've studied you like prey.

34:27.674 --> 34:29.458
Your bases in the L'Tar Nebula

34:29.458 --> 34:31.504
were rumored
in Federation intelligence.

34:31.504 --> 34:34.594
Now I know they exist, or you
would have welcomed our help

34:34.594 --> 34:36.509
to secure a trade route.

34:36.509 --> 34:39.773
<i>Clever, yet I fail to see
why that should intrigue me.</i>

34:39.773 --> 34:42.906
Because, Primarch,
I have the ear

34:42.906 --> 34:45.170
of numerous planets
in that region.

34:45.170 --> 34:49.478
Even now, many are preparing to
attack your bases without mercy

34:49.478 --> 34:52.177
unless I order them
to stand down.

34:52.177 --> 34:54.614
<i>They would lose
thousands of lives.</i>

34:54.614 --> 34:56.094
And you will be weakened,

34:56.094 --> 34:58.096
allowing the other Primarchs
to strike.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.881
That will cost you the throne.

35:00.881 --> 35:02.752
The only way to avoid
such an outcome

35:02.752 --> 35:06.147
is to turn your fleet around.

35:06.147 --> 35:08.149
<i>You are bluffing.</i>

35:08.149 --> 35:09.977
<i>You do not have

My species went extinct
billions of years ago.

39:39.899 --> 39:45.731
But our minds--
yours and mine-- are here,

39:45.731 --> 39:48.473
in this liminal space-time
adjacent to my own.

39:51.345 --> 39:53.173
Why did you bring me here?

Yes, Moll, the person

differently in here.

40:49.664 --> 40:51.753
In your present moment,

the technology is merely
gathering the power

40:54.277 --> 40:56.671
it requires to perform
its function:

40:56.671 --> 40:59.631
designing and creating life.

40:59.631 --> 41:03.112
Can it be used to restore life?

41:03.112 --> 41:06.289
A new being can replace
a lost one.

41:06.289 --> 41:11.120
But though the new replacement
would be genetically identical,

41:11.120 --> 41:14.472
it would share
none of its memories,

41:14.472 --> 41:17.387
none of its fundamental essence.

41:17.387 --> 41:21.304
Still, the speed of creation
is adjustable,

41:21.304 --> 41:24.482
as is scale,
if you wish to try.

41:24.482 --> 41:27.528
Wait, if speed and scale
can be controlled,

41:27.528 --> 41:29.878
somebody can use this
to engineer an army.

41:29.878 --> 41:32.751
A brick is just a brick.

41:32.751 --> 41:35.318
It can create a home

41:35.318 --> 41:37.103
or destroy a body.

41:37.103 --> 41:40.802
That's why we chose
only to seed life.

41:40.802 --> 41:42.543
You may have seen evidence of it

41:42.543 --> 41:44.414
in the tunnel
that brought you here.

41:44.414 --> 41:46.721
Those were all worlds

41:46.721 --> 41:48.288
No.

41:48.288 --> 41:50.333
We found them here.

41:51.596 --> 41:53.772
You found them?

41:57.036 --> 41:58.733
You didn't build this?

41:58.733 --> 42:01.649
We theorize that
whoever created this

42:01.649 --> 42:04.304
created us.

42:04.304 --> 42:07.394
But perhaps it goes
even further back.

42:07.394 --> 42:10.092
A cycle of creators
and creations,

42:10.092 --> 42:12.094
countless times over,

42:12.094 --> 42:15.010
this place predates them all.

How'd you know how to grab it?

42:51.917 --> 42:53.571
A memory of Jinaal's.

The scientists ran
into the same problem

42:56.530 --> 42:58.488
when they started to build

42:58.488 --> 43:00.142
I thought you didn't have

43:00.142 --> 43:01.883
I don't.

43:03.537 --> 43:05.887
This is the first time
it's ever happened, and I'm...

43:07.672 --> 43:11.589
I'm sitting here, wondering:
Why that one?

43:11.589 --> 43:13.634
- Why now?
- BOOK: Right.

43:14.809 --> 43:16.811
How did I know that
I had to come with you?

43:21.903 --> 43:24.950
I was hoping
for an answer, but...

43:24.950 --> 43:27.866

43:27.866 --> 43:29.998
...there isn't one.

43:29.998 --> 43:33.654

that would've driven me crazy.

43:33.654 --> 43:35.047
[chuckles] Yeah.

43:35.047 --> 43:37.310
