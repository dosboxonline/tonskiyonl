01:20.791 --> 01:22.415
You must be hungry.

01:24.875 --> 01:26.833
Where am I?

01:28.083 --> 01:31.000
I don't remember anything.

01:33.041 --> 01:34.250
Who am I?

01:35.333 --> 01:38.125
Better question.
You are the Chosen.

01:39.208 --> 01:41.750
And only the Chosen may escape the maze.

01:45.333 --> 01:46.750
Wait.

02:34.916 --> 02:36.374
It is you.

02:36.375 --> 02:38.916
This world has waited for your arrival.

02:39.916 --> 02:41.957
What is my purpose?

02:41.958 --> 02:43.457
You eat.

02:43.458 --> 02:46.958
- I-I don't understand.
-  You will.

02:57.041 --> 02:58.958
Aah!

03:03.708 --> 03:05.749
You understand now.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.666
Eat or be eaten.

03:17.125 --> 03:19.165
What is all this?

03:19.166 --> 03:22.125
An endless labyrinth,
haunted by hungry ghosts.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.249
But you will escape the maze.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.915
You will open the door.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.082
Because you are the Chosen.

03:30.083 --> 03:32.666
The Chosen. Right.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.790
Eat or be eaten.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.833
Aah!

04:19.000 --> 04:20.250
Aah!

04:25.875 --> 04:28.291


05:12.458 --> 05:14.208
Kill it.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.874
Eat it.

05:16.875 --> 05:20.124
You can't eat a ghost.

05:20.125 --> 05:22.332
Of course you can.

05:22.333 --> 05:25.707
You can eat them over and over again,

05:25.708 --> 05:27.916
just never their eyes.

05:31.416 --> 05:33.499
You can't run from your ghosts forever.

05:33.500 --> 05:37.915
Eventually you'll have to
face them, and then...

05:37.916 --> 05:39.874
Let me guess:

05:39.875 --> 05:41.750
eat or be eaten?

05:43.500 --> 05:45.415
<i>You are not just
trapped in a maze.</i>

05:45.416 --> 05:46.500
Aah!

05:49.375 --> 05:52.208
<i>You have been blessed
with a chance to practice.</i>

05:57.791 --> 05:59.624
<i>There's strength in repetition.</i>

06:09.541 --> 06:12.040
<i>You will open the door.</i>

06:14.125 --> 06:16.665
<i>But you must eat.</i>

06:16.666 --> 06:19.832
<i>Eat. Eat.</i>

06:19.833 --> 06:21.000
<i>Eat!</i>

06:30.250 --> 06:31.916
It's time.

06:42.916 --> 06:44.916
This is it.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.208
The Chosen.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.124
I... can't.

07:33.125 --> 07:34.750
I know.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.540
What are you doing?!

07:48.083 --> 07:50.499
We will escape the maze.

07:50.500 --> 07:51.665
What's happening?

07:53.666 --> 07:55.458
No!

07:57.125 --> 07:58.707
You devour.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.874
- No, no, no! Stop!
-  We'll escape!

08:02.875 --> 08:04.124
Devour.

08:04.125 --> 08:07.374
<i>Escape the maze.</i>

08:07.375 --> 08:09.165
-  We'll escape.
- Aah!

08:09.166 --> 08:10.583
No!

08:18.375 --> 08:20.790
You are the one...

08:20.791 --> 08:22.958
trapped.

08:35.916 --> 08:38.415
There's strength in repetition.

08:38.416 --> 08:42.124
There's strength in repetition.

08:42.125 --> 08:43.790
There's strength
in repetition.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.375
There's strength...

09:18.291 --> 09:20.583
You must be hungry.
