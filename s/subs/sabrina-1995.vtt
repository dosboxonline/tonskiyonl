00:32.674 --> 00:34.610
(BIRDS TWITTERING)
(BELL RINGING)

00:56.799 --> 00:58.801
WOMAN: Once upon a time,

00:58.834 --> 01:00.636
on the North Shore
of Long Island,

01:01.837 --> 01:03.472
not far from New York,

01:04.640 --> 01:06.709
there was a very,
very large mansion,

01:07.643 --> 01:08.844
almost a castle,

01:09.978 --> 01:11.780
where there lived a family

01:11.814 --> 01:13.582
by the name of Larrabee.

01:18.621 --> 01:21.023
There were servants
inside the mansion

01:21.056 --> 01:22.591
and servants
outside the mansion,

01:24.059 --> 01:25.728
boatmen to tend the boats,

01:27.129 --> 01:28.831
and six crews of gardeners,

01:29.865 --> 01:32.000
two for the solarium,

01:32.034 --> 01:33.736
the rest for the grounds,

01:34.870 --> 01:36.905
and a tree surgeon on retainer.

01:38.874 --> 01:42.010
There were specialists
for the indoor tennis courts

01:42.044 --> 01:44.713
and the outdoor tennis courts,

01:44.747 --> 01:47.583
the outdoor swimming pool,
and the indoor swimming pool.

01:48.951 --> 01:50.919
And over the garage,

01:50.953 --> 01:52.888
there lived a chauffeur
by the name of Fairchild,

01:54.289 --> 01:55.924
imported from England years ago,

01:57.159 --> 01:58.661
together with
a Rolls-Royce

02:00.062 --> 02:02.130
and a daughter

02:02.164 --> 02:03.799
named Sabrina.

02:03.832 --> 02:06.134
* In the moonlight

02:07.936 --> 02:10.606
* When the shadows play

02:12.340 --> 02:15.944
* When the thought
Of what could happen

02:15.978 --> 02:18.581
* Takes your breath away

02:20.883 --> 02:22.918
* Sighs and whispers

02:25.220 --> 02:28.156
* Quiet laughter in the air

02:29.992 --> 02:32.995
* Can make it seem that love

02:33.028 --> 02:35.297
* Is everywhere...

02:35.330 --> 02:37.099
WOMAN: Among other things,

02:37.132 --> 02:39.635
the Larrabees were noted
for the parties they gave.

02:41.169 --> 02:43.672
Few people anymore give
parties the way they did.

02:46.775 --> 02:49.845
* Make it relatively easy...

02:49.878 --> 02:52.681
WOMAN: It never rained on the
night of a Larrabee party.

02:52.715 --> 02:54.315
The Larrabees wouldn't
have stood for it.

02:55.383 --> 02:58.220
* In the half-light

02:59.387 --> 03:01.056
* Can we trust *

03:01.089 --> 03:02.725
WOMAN: There was
Maude Larrabee,

03:02.758 --> 03:04.860
who inherited
the Larrabee corporation

03:04.893 --> 03:07.830
when her husband died on the
13th hole at Pebble Beach.

03:07.863 --> 03:10.165
Sweetheart, go talk
to Colonel Morgan.

03:10.198 --> 03:12.134
He looks bored.

03:12.167 --> 03:15.771
Senator, have I got somebody
I want you to meet.

03:15.804 --> 03:17.806
WOMAN: Maude was on
the cover of Fortune.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.710
There was Linus, the older son,

03:21.744 --> 03:24.613
who graduated from Yale at 19

03:24.647 --> 03:26.615
and took his mother
and the company for a ride

03:26.649 --> 03:28.684
on the fiber-optic highway

03:28.717 --> 03:30.986
and turned a $100 million
family business

03:31.019 --> 03:32.287
into some serious money.

03:32.320 --> 03:33.789
Well, I just don't
feel like buying

03:33.822 --> 03:35.791
any more networks this year.

03:35.824 --> 03:37.292
There's never anything good on.

03:38.894 --> 03:42.665
I said the offer expired at 10:00.
It's 10:08, Robert.

03:42.698 --> 03:44.178
WOMAN: Linus was on
the cover of Time.

03:48.070 --> 03:49.037
But most of all,

03:51.106 --> 03:52.641
there was David,

03:53.676 --> 03:55.043
the younger son...

03:56.378 --> 03:58.380
Who was in and out
of many schools

03:58.413 --> 03:59.882
and even more relationships.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.018
He was handsome and charming

04:03.051 --> 04:03.971
and funny and romantic.

04:05.120 --> 04:07.756
It's so rare to meet
such a beautiful woman

04:08.891 --> 04:10.893
with your sense of
humor and irony...

04:12.094 --> 04:13.261
And poetry...

04:14.429 --> 04:16.064
And hair color.

04:16.098 --> 04:18.300
WOMAN: David did a Gap ad.

04:21.168 --> 04:22.370
Sabrina?

04:24.406 --> 04:25.373
Sabrina, come down.

04:27.109 --> 04:27.943
(LAUGHING)

04:28.711 --> 04:30.078
Oh.

04:30.112 --> 04:31.680
Uh!
She made him laugh.

04:31.714 --> 04:32.794
You have to finish packing.

04:33.181 --> 04:34.049
Am I witty?

04:35.483 --> 04:37.352
I wonder if Paris
is far away enough.

04:37.385 --> 04:40.055
No, really. Do you
think I'm funny?

04:40.088 --> 04:42.725
Hilarious. You should
host a talk show.

04:42.758 --> 04:45.227
Sabrina, the full-time
observation of David Larrabee

04:45.260 --> 04:46.460
is not a recognized profession.

04:46.461 --> 04:47.996
Get out of that tree.

04:50.766 --> 04:52.000
I'll be there in a minute.

05:26.501 --> 05:27.870
Oh!

05:27.903 --> 05:28.904
It's just you, Sabrina.

05:30.873 --> 05:31.807
Hello, David.

05:33.308 --> 05:34.810
I thought I heard somebody.

05:39.147 --> 05:40.715
No, it's nobody.

05:42.384 --> 05:45.487
* How can I remember things

05:45.520 --> 05:48.023
* That never happened

05:49.324 --> 05:51.159
* Arms that never held me

05:53.061 --> 05:54.863
* Lips I never kissed

05:56.064 --> 06:00.402
* How can I remember?

06:03.471 --> 06:06.741
* Why do I keep seeing
someone's face

06:07.342 --> 06:08.877
* Before me?

06:10.145 --> 06:11.914
* Eyes that say they know me

06:13.148 --> 06:15.417
* Shining through the mist

06:16.484 --> 06:21.156
* Eyes that I remember

06:23.591 --> 06:25.393
* I don't know why

06:26.528 --> 06:28.430
* Or when or where *

06:42.610 --> 06:43.879
Sabrina?

06:50.118 --> 06:52.187
You've spent more of
your life up that tree

06:52.220 --> 06:53.420
than you have on solid ground.

06:55.991 --> 06:57.860
You know how lucky we are

06:57.893 --> 07:00.996
that Mrs. Larrabee has friends
who have a job for you,

07:01.029 --> 07:02.965
so you can have
this European experience?

07:06.101 --> 07:08.070
The time in Paris
will be so good for you.

07:10.205 --> 07:12.474
If your mother were
alive, she'd be so happy.

07:14.009 --> 07:15.477
It's what she always wanted.

07:15.510 --> 07:16.845
What if he forgets all about me?

07:18.213 --> 07:20.133
How can he forget someone
he doesn't know exists?

07:21.917 --> 07:23.185
I didn't mean that, Sabrina.

07:25.220 --> 07:26.588
I just meant...

07:28.290 --> 07:30.525
There's much more to you
than this obsession.

07:30.558 --> 07:31.559
I hope you know that.

07:33.428 --> 07:34.897
Thanks, Dad.

07:36.564 --> 07:38.000
Good night.

07:50.612 --> 07:53.515
* How can I remember things

07:53.548 --> 07:55.884

07:57.219 --> 07:59.587
* Arms that never held me

08:00.455 --> 08:02.290
* Lips I've never kissed? *

08:04.659 --> 08:06.394
WOMAN: I need more
help out here.

08:06.428 --> 08:07.862
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

08:09.697 --> 08:11.566
Where you going?
It's early.

08:11.599 --> 08:13.401
It takes me half an hour
to get out of here.

08:13.435 --> 08:14.903
I got to check
on the Tokyo market

08:14.937 --> 08:16.257
before it closes. Good night.
Bye.

08:25.580 --> 08:28.116
Linus, Andrea Colson told me

08:28.150 --> 08:30.552
you just fired her son.
He's an idiot.

08:30.585 --> 08:33.188
But she was a bridesmaid
at my wedding.

08:33.221 --> 08:34.522
She is one of my best friends.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.691
This is business, mother.

08:36.724 --> 08:40.062
Listen, I got to drop something
off in David's room.

08:40.095 --> 08:42.330
When he surfaces from this
week's love of his life,

08:42.364 --> 08:44.198
tell him I put his suspenders
back in his closet.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.935
You're not leaving now!
You'll miss my fireworks.

08:47.535 --> 08:49.037
It's okay, Mother.

08:49.071 --> 08:51.006
I had a pony ride
and I got my face painted.

08:52.374 --> 08:53.208
Good night.

09:11.526 --> 09:12.995
David, David.

09:40.688 --> 09:41.623
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

09:42.557 --> 09:43.591
Come in.

09:50.432 --> 09:51.312
I came to say goodbye.

09:52.034 --> 09:53.135
What?

09:53.168 --> 09:54.002
Don't come out!

09:56.404 --> 09:58.685
If I look at you, I might not
be able to get through this.

09:59.307 --> 10:00.442
Okay.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.976
Please don't say anything.

10:04.579 --> 10:06.114
I'm leaving tomorrow for Paris,

10:08.150 --> 10:09.351
and I'll be away a long time.

10:11.153 --> 10:14.056
I don't expect you to think
about me while I'm gone.

10:14.089 --> 10:15.889
You haven't thought about
me while I was here.

10:17.592 --> 10:19.294
I just want to say...

10:22.330 --> 10:24.732
I think... I think I know you
better than anybody else.

10:26.268 --> 10:28.736
I mean, whatever
they think or say,

10:28.770 --> 10:30.338
I know the truth...

10:31.306 --> 10:33.007
That you're
a wonderful person...

10:34.342 --> 10:36.078
Kind and generous and...

10:38.480 --> 10:40.415
And for what it's worth,
know that someone...

10:41.349 --> 10:43.151
Very far away
is thinking of you.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.422
So if there's anything
I can ever do...

10:50.358 --> 10:51.526
Could you bring me

10:51.559 --> 10:53.395
one of those little Eiffel
Tower paperweights?

10:55.263 --> 10:56.298
Oh, my God!

11:04.506 --> 11:05.807

11:27.862 --> 11:30.165
Oui, oui, oui, oui.
Ca va?

11:30.198 --> 11:31.366
Ca va.
Bonjour.

11:50.352 --> 11:51.753
Welcome to Vogue, Sabrina.

11:51.786 --> 11:52.786
You speak no French, yes?

11:53.388 --> 11:54.789
No.
No?

11:54.822 --> 11:55.790
I mean, yes, I don't.

11:57.692 --> 11:59.161
Sorry. Please, could you
repeat the question?

11:59.194 --> 12:01.463
(SPEAKING IN FRENCH)

12:01.496 --> 12:02.697
We have many shoes, you see.

Very, very important.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.400

But the most important is
Louboutin, Manolo, and Umberlin.

very good the English.

When we need it tell,
need it tell, okay?

12:20.848 --> 12:22.817
You'll tell. And all the
days, most important,

12:22.850 --> 12:25.320
Louboutin, Manolos, Umberlin.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.488
Louboutin...

Ingrid, hurry up!

12:42.670 --> 12:44.472
I am putting in my contacts.

12:44.506 --> 12:46.708
No, no. (SPEAKING IN

12:46.741 --> 12:47.875
Another one! No!

Sabrina, don't
worry for Martine.

13:31.586 --> 13:33.221
I tortured her.

13:33.255 --> 13:35.423
Now she tortures you.

13:35.457 --> 13:38.593
Succeed, you'll get someone
of your own to torture.

13:40.695 --> 13:44.232
TOM: But you've only been
there for two weeks.

13:44.266 --> 13:45.900
I doubt every single
person in Paris

13:45.933 --> 13:47.402
thinks you're an idiot.

13:47.435 --> 13:49.237
Only because I haven't
met them all.

13:49.271 --> 13:52.240
Sabrina, you're being
much too hard on yourself.

13:52.274 --> 13:54.609
Give it a chance.

13:54.642 --> 13:57.579
Now, what matters
is you're away from here,

13:57.612 --> 14:01.783
experiencing new things, getting
another view of the world,

14:01.816 --> 14:03.285
finding new friends,

14:04.919 --> 14:07.589
and not constantly thinking about...
You know who!

14:13.795 --> 14:14.635
Morning.
Morning, Tom.

14:21.836 --> 14:22.970
She's fine.

14:24.439 --> 14:26.708
She hasn't adjusted
completely, but she...

14:26.741 --> 14:27.909
She's miserable.
I knew it.

14:27.942 --> 14:29.311
I told you not to send her.

14:29.344 --> 14:32.547
Mr. Tom, maybe
this not for me

14:32.580 --> 14:34.282
to put my hands in this,

14:34.316 --> 14:35.796
but when I first
come to this country,

14:35.850 --> 14:37.319
I am alone,

14:37.352 --> 14:40.288
like Sabrina.
I just weigh more.

14:40.322 --> 14:43.525
So I ask to God,
"Why I am here?"

14:44.692 --> 14:45.993
I say, "Why, God?"

14:47.462 --> 14:48.596
But there is no answer.

14:49.331 --> 14:51.265
So... I stop crying.

14:51.999 --> 14:54.001
It takes 11 years!

14:56.604 --> 14:57.539
Thank you, Rosa.

14:58.340 --> 14:59.674
Did she mention David?

14:59.707 --> 15:00.942
Just that life without him

15:00.975 --> 15:03.711
is a hopeless abyss of
misery and despair.

You got a minute?

16:58.025 --> 16:59.761
David, does it ever occur to you

16:59.794 --> 17:01.629

the Larrabee Corporation?

17:01.663 --> 17:02.997
Listen, Linus, I met someone.

17:03.030 --> 17:05.433
Recall the address of our building?
It's 389 Park Avenue.

17:05.467 --> 17:06.568
Hey, I'm not kidding!

17:06.601 --> 17:08.102
Your office is on
the 48th floor.

17:08.135 --> 17:09.871
This is really somebody!

17:09.904 --> 17:11.439
So what's the problem?

17:11.473 --> 17:13.575
Well, I've invited her
for dinner here Friday,

17:13.608 --> 17:15.127
and I just don't want
you and mother...

17:16.010 --> 17:17.849
Listen, this girl is
smart, she's really smart.

17:18.746 --> 17:21.115
Well, that certainly
hasn't come up before.

17:21.147 --> 17:23.851
Listen, Linus,
she's a real woman.

17:23.885 --> 17:25.118
She's not a, you know...

17:25.152 --> 17:27.221

She's not a bimbo.

17:27.253 --> 17:29.891
She's a doctor.
Pediatrician, actually.

17:29.924 --> 17:31.125
How did you meet her?

17:31.158 --> 17:32.527
I was at this party,

17:32.560 --> 17:35.497
and the host's kid got
sick with something

17:35.530 --> 17:37.532
and I rushed him over to
Lennox Hill emergency,

17:37.565 --> 17:39.445
and she was the resident
on duty, and we just...

17:39.934 --> 17:41.769
We just hit it right off.

17:41.803 --> 17:43.104
How'd the sick kid make out?

17:44.271 --> 17:45.973
Listen, when you guys meet her,

17:46.007 --> 17:47.509
just try to make me look good.

17:48.510 --> 17:49.777
I mean, I know I look
good, but you know,

17:49.811 --> 17:51.913
try to make me sound good.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.548

17:54.916 --> 17:56.150

18:14.068 --> 18:15.970
Wow. Great hat,

18:16.003 --> 18:18.172
Good morning, blue eyes.

and make you look good.

Harvey, I want you to start
buying up chunks of Tyson stock,

not so much that
anybody would notice.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.213
That's it.

19:02.249 --> 19:03.785
I hope she doesn't
look like Patrick.

19:05.086 --> 19:07.789
For once,
your father didn't lie.

19:07.822 --> 19:09.757
You are lovely!
Thank you.

I'm Maude.

Linus.

19:13.060 --> 19:14.562
I've heard a lot about
you from my father.

19:14.596 --> 19:15.930
And you're really a doctor?

19:15.963 --> 19:17.799
No. He made that up.

19:17.832 --> 19:19.567
(ALL LAUGHING)

19:19.601 --> 19:22.036
She was just promoted to
assistant head of pediatrics.

hospital could count on us

19:24.305 --> 19:25.607
for a couple million dollars.

casually 40 or 50 times

20:21.162 --> 20:22.329
when you first came over?

20:23.364 --> 20:25.733
He sounds perhaps
like an illusion.

He keeps me company.

20:54.696 --> 20:56.097
and I wrote nonsense
in a journal...

And then, somehow,

21:01.402 --> 21:02.770
it was not nonsense.

42:16.209 --> 42:17.610
(ORCHESTRA PLAYING
LA VIE EN ROSE)

42:22.248 --> 42:23.149
For you.

42:34.995 --> 42:37.130
Who's that?
Who?

42:37.163 --> 42:38.198
That girl.

42:38.731 --> 42:40.033
The one with David.

42:40.066 --> 42:41.226
MAUDE: Oh, well,
oh, that's...

42:42.268 --> 42:43.228
That's... That's just...

42:43.569 --> 42:45.305
Oh, my God.

42:45.338 --> 42:46.372
That's Sabrina.

42:47.607 --> 42:50.376
David's known her since
she was 2 years old.

42:51.144 --> 42:52.078
Hmm.

42:52.578 --> 42:53.980
She didn't have that dress

42:54.014 --> 42:55.248
when she was 2 years old.

42:55.281 --> 42:58.251
She's drinking champagne
and eating seafood.

42:58.284 --> 43:00.053
And her hair's washed,

43:00.086 --> 43:02.622
and her lips are red,
and her teeth are white.

43:02.655 --> 43:04.424
And he made a song for her.

43:04.457 --> 43:05.225
I don't like it.

43:05.658 --> 43:07.727
Well, Sabrina.

43:08.694 --> 43:10.263
When did you get back?

43:10.296 --> 43:11.564
Yesterday.

43:11.597 --> 43:13.033
Happy birthday,
Mrs. Larrabee.

43:13.066 --> 43:15.301
For a minute,
I didn't recognize you.

43:15.335 --> 43:17.103
(CHUCKLES) It's the haircut.

43:17.703 --> 43:19.405
To say the least.

43:19.439 --> 43:20.719
Some surprise,
isn't she, mother?

43:21.341 --> 43:23.176
She certainly is, son.

43:26.046 --> 43:27.113
Ah!

43:27.547 --> 43:28.648
Wow!

43:35.655 --> 43:37.190
(INAUDIBLE)

43:41.161 --> 43:42.228
Dance with me.

43:42.262 --> 43:43.129
Now?

43:44.364 --> 43:45.698
While the music's playing.

43:45.731 --> 43:46.811
It's harder when they stop.

43:47.500 --> 43:48.434
Come on.

44:16.362 --> 44:17.297
David.

44:18.131 --> 44:20.066
Yes?

44:20.100 --> 44:22.100
You know, I've been to every
party you've ever had.

44:23.636 --> 44:25.305
Right there.

44:25.338 --> 44:26.439
Watching from that tree.

44:28.574 --> 44:30.042
Like a bat.

44:31.444 --> 44:32.812
And now here we are, dancing,

44:32.845 --> 44:34.280
in front of God and everyone.

44:37.183 --> 44:39.185
I should have paid
more attention to you.

44:40.253 --> 44:41.653
I don't know
what I was thinking of.

44:42.488 --> 44:43.589
Yourself.

44:43.623 --> 44:44.690
(LAUGHING)

44:47.693 --> 44:49.229
It feels so good to hold you.

44:50.396 --> 44:51.331
Does it?

44:53.133 --> 44:54.467
Do you know
how beautiful you are?

44:57.603 --> 44:58.538
No.

45:00.606 --> 45:01.507
You're dazzling.

45:04.410 --> 45:05.845
Dazzling?

45:05.878 --> 45:07.847
Suddenly back in my
life and dazzling.

45:10.683 --> 45:11.851
Am I back in your life?

45:13.286 --> 45:14.420
I don't think you realize

45:14.454 --> 45:15.388
what you've done to me.

45:17.423 --> 45:18.491
Then you better tell me.

45:20.193 --> 45:22.495
You're changing everything.

45:22.528 --> 45:24.730
MAUDE: She's like a
sister to him, Patrick.

45:25.598 --> 45:26.799
I have a sister.

45:27.633 --> 45:28.593
That's not how we dance.

45:32.538 --> 45:33.873
(INAUDIBLE)

45:40.613 --> 45:42.315
It's Sabrina.
Go and see.

45:53.626 --> 45:55.261
I can't believe
this is happening.

45:56.262 --> 45:57.830
You're absolutely transformed.

46:00.366 --> 46:01.567
And you're exactly the same.

46:03.303 --> 46:05.023
(CHUCKLING) You were perfect.
You still are.

46:07.807 --> 46:08.808
Sabrina.

46:09.575 --> 46:10.543
Yes?

46:11.611 --> 46:12.912
Let's go someplace we can talk.

46:17.750 --> 46:18.918
We are talking.

46:20.620 --> 46:22.188
Someplace else.

46:23.689 --> 46:24.557
Please.

46:26.292 --> 46:27.760
I haven't seen you in years.

46:28.794 --> 46:30.162
I'm not sure I ever saw you.

46:30.896 --> 46:32.265
Come with me.

46:33.633 --> 46:35.167
For a little while.

46:36.402 --> 46:37.802
We could just go...
To the solarium?

46:38.771 --> 46:39.839
What?

46:40.773 --> 46:42.242
It has to be the solarium.

46:45.311 --> 46:48.248
And you bring
a bottle of champagne.

46:48.281 --> 46:50.601
And you put the glasses in the
back pockets of your jacket.

46:52.518 --> 46:54.487
I don't think there
are any back pockets

46:54.520 --> 46:55.855
to my jacket.

46:57.390 --> 46:58.858
You were paying attention.

47:02.795 --> 47:04.264
And the orchestra will play...

47:05.798 --> 47:07.199
How Can I Remember?

47:08.768 --> 47:09.869
Yes.

47:11.271 --> 47:12.405
I'll have them do that.

47:23.048 --> 47:24.617
And then afterwards...

47:25.851 --> 47:26.952
I'll wake up.

47:31.824 --> 47:33.225
(LAUGHTER)

47:38.831 --> 47:40.600
(HUMMING)

47:42.968 --> 47:44.904
Great.
Thank you very much.

47:44.937 --> 47:46.339
Appreciate it.
See you later.

47:47.006 --> 47:48.441
You got a minute?

47:48.474 --> 47:50.543
Not right now, actually.
I have an appointment.

47:50.576 --> 47:52.345
Sure, you do.

47:52.378 --> 47:54.847
David, what are you doing?

47:54.880 --> 47:56.248
Are you insane?

47:56.949 --> 47:58.651
Right smack dab in front of

47:58.684 --> 48:01.287
your prominent and
paranoid future in-laws,

48:01.321 --> 48:03.389
you are hustling
the chauffeur's daughter!

48:03.856 --> 48:04.924
We were dancing.

48:04.957 --> 48:06.692
Stop dancing!

48:06.726 --> 48:08.726
You mean to tell me I can't
have a drink and a dance

48:08.728 --> 48:09.595
with an old friend?

48:11.997 --> 48:14.434
Do I look stupid?

48:14.467 --> 48:16.969
I never thought of myself
as stupid, but maybe I am.

48:17.002 --> 48:17.970
I didn't do anything.

48:18.003 --> 48:19.872
You were planning to.

48:19.905 --> 48:21.974
How do you know?
You're kidding, right?

48:22.007 --> 48:23.976
David, you're like my own son.

48:24.009 --> 48:25.311
I am your own son, mother.

48:25.678 --> 48:26.679
Exactly!

48:27.747 --> 48:30.015
I endured 21 hours of hard labor

48:30.049 --> 48:31.551
to bring you into the world.

48:31.584 --> 48:33.853
The doctors begged me
to take drugs,

48:33.886 --> 48:35.321
but I kept saying

48:35.355 --> 48:36.915
I wouldn't do anything
to hurt my child.

48:37.022 --> 48:39.024
Well, I changed my mind.

48:39.058 --> 48:40.426
You screw up with Elizabeth,

48:40.460 --> 48:41.500
and I swear I'll kill you.

48:43.463 --> 48:44.930
I don't know.

48:44.964 --> 48:47.066
There's something about Sabrina.

48:47.099 --> 48:49.335
I think... I know
this sounds crazy...

48:49.369 --> 48:51.249
But I really think I'm
falling in love with her.

48:51.371 --> 48:52.538
Oh, God!

48:52.572 --> 48:54.507
Listen, I didn't plan this.

48:54.540 --> 48:55.508
I can't help it.

48:55.541 --> 48:56.409
She's so...

48:58.511 --> 49:01.514
Something.
Sensational.

49:01.547 --> 49:03.616
The last time you found
someone sensational,

49:03.649 --> 49:05.718
it cost the family
$1.5 million.

49:05.751 --> 49:06.786
No! This time
it's different.

49:06.819 --> 49:08.120
Oh, that's so original.

49:08.153 --> 49:10.923
What about Elizabeth?
You finally find

49:10.956 --> 49:12.492
the right girl...

49:12.525 --> 49:14.760
Who's got the right parents
who own the right company.

49:14.794 --> 49:16.462
You asked her to marry you!

49:16.496 --> 49:17.416
Actually, she asked me.

49:19.465 --> 49:21.225
Mother, go outside and
blow out your candles.

49:21.867 --> 49:23.536
Can't we send somebody?

49:24.570 --> 49:26.406
David, what do you
think Sabrina wants?

49:27.640 --> 49:29.609
She's lived her whole
life above that garage

49:29.642 --> 49:31.043
with her nose pressed
against the glass,

49:31.076 --> 49:32.636
or in that tree,
watching us at parties.

49:33.913 --> 49:35.948
Now you invite her to one.

49:35.981 --> 49:38.951
You're in your Rolex
jacket or whatever.

49:38.984 --> 49:40.686
You tell her to
meet you in the solarium.

49:40.720 --> 49:42.855
She knows you're gonna show up
with a bottle of champagne.

49:42.888 --> 49:44.790
That's not it. That has
nothing to do with it!

49:44.824 --> 49:46.492
She knows what's coming...

49:46.526 --> 49:48.093
The jet to Martha's Vineyard,

49:48.127 --> 49:50.062
the cottage full of
food and flowers,

49:50.095 --> 49:51.997
house seats to some
sold-out show.

49:52.031 --> 49:53.666
Drinks at the Carlyle.

49:53.699 --> 49:56.402
A day or two of that,
she'd fall for Noriega.

49:56.436 --> 49:58.838
You don't know her. You don't
know the way she makes me feel.

49:58.871 --> 50:01.507
I can't be engaged to somebody
when I feel like this.

50:04.076 --> 50:05.978
David, sit down. I can't
talk about this right now.

50:06.011 --> 50:07.531
I have to be some place.
Just sit down.

50:10.182 --> 50:11.817
(CRUNCHING)
(SCREAMING)

50:12.985 --> 50:15.455
What?
I sat on the glasses!

50:15.488 --> 50:17.189
Don't move. Mother, go get Dr.
Calloway.

50:17.222 --> 50:19.492
He's at the bar. Who put
glasses on the chair?

50:19.525 --> 50:21.427
I'm bleeding! Could we
talk about this later?

50:21.461 --> 50:24.029
Oh, my God!
Linus, stay with him!

50:24.063 --> 50:25.531
Darling, don't worry.

50:26.165 --> 50:27.833
Just elevate... Something.

50:28.167 --> 50:30.470
Ah... God.

50:30.503 --> 50:31.704
Bad?

50:31.737 --> 50:33.606
Sabrina, she's waiting for me.

50:34.740 --> 50:35.620
I'll take care of her.

50:53.125 --> 50:54.660
(GLASSES CLINKING)

50:56.729 --> 50:57.663
Linus.

50:58.197 --> 50:59.699
Hello, Sabrina.

51:00.766 --> 51:02.468
I have a message from David.

51:03.503 --> 51:04.623
He won't be able to make it.

51:05.771 --> 51:06.872
He sent me.

51:09.041 --> 51:11.110
I'm sorry.
You're upset.

51:12.144 --> 51:13.212
Of course.

51:13.245 --> 51:15.447
Yes. No. Uh...

51:16.649 --> 51:17.850
I don't know.
(CHUCKLING)

51:19.184 --> 51:20.486
I'm a little tired.

51:23.288 --> 51:25.157
Why didn't he come?

51:25.190 --> 51:26.910
He was on his way. He
had a slight accident.

51:28.193 --> 51:29.461
He sat on a champagne flute.

51:30.796 --> 51:31.731
Is he okay?

51:32.698 --> 51:33.778
He's in the emergency room.

51:34.033 --> 51:34.867
Emergency room?

51:35.801 --> 51:36.702
It was a sharp flute.

51:37.737 --> 51:38.704
Hey...

51:39.304 --> 51:40.706
That's a little joke.

51:41.173 --> 51:42.241
(POPPING)

51:43.075 --> 51:44.610
Should I drive over to see him?

51:46.078 --> 51:47.479
He'll be fine.

51:48.280 --> 51:49.749
Couple of stitches.

51:50.816 --> 51:51.917
You can see him tomorrow.

51:54.920 --> 51:55.755
What's this for?

51:56.889 --> 51:58.223
Part of the message from David.

52:04.964 --> 52:06.804
They've sent you to deal
with me, haven't they?

52:08.133 --> 52:09.869
They?

52:09.902 --> 52:11.804
Like a lawyer in a movie.

52:13.706 --> 52:16.208
He goes to the
unsuitable waitress

52:16.241 --> 52:18.177
or showgirl or...

52:19.178 --> 52:20.312
Chauffeur's daughter

52:21.881 --> 52:25.117
and says the family is
prepared to offer you $100,000

52:25.150 --> 52:26.686
to stay away from their son.

52:28.253 --> 52:29.789
"No," she says.

52:30.089 --> 52:31.256
"150,000."

52:32.124 --> 52:33.593
"No..."
200,000.

52:35.027 --> 52:35.961
No.

52:36.896 --> 52:37.830
A million.

52:45.905 --> 52:47.973
No self-respecting
lawyer would offer less.

52:51.744 --> 52:53.212
No self-respecting
waitress...

52:56.248 --> 52:57.549
Would take it.

52:59.284 --> 53:00.552
Good girl.

53:07.059 --> 53:08.260
I've loved him all my life.

53:09.629 --> 53:10.562
Have you?

53:11.731 --> 53:12.691
I thought I was over it.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.235
Surprise, surprise.

53:17.803 --> 53:18.704
You don't object?

53:20.039 --> 53:21.774
Object?
To you?

53:22.975 --> 53:23.843
Look at you.

53:25.377 --> 53:27.112
It's as though a lovely breeze

53:27.146 --> 53:28.914
has swept through
this whole house.

53:28.948 --> 53:30.015
Even though the breeze

53:30.049 --> 53:31.889
comes from the general
direction of the garage?

53:33.118 --> 53:34.654
It's the nineties, Sabrina.

53:35.154 --> 53:36.588
So they say.

53:37.757 --> 53:40.660
* How can I remember things

53:40.693 --> 53:42.762
* That never happened

53:43.996 --> 53:46.331
* Arms that never held me

53:47.366 --> 53:49.034
* Lips I've never kissed

53:51.904 --> 53:54.073
They played that the night
before I left for Paris.

53:55.007 --> 53:57.242
* How can I remember

53:57.276 --> 53:58.978
They often do play that.

53:59.912 --> 54:00.780
Hmm.

54:02.114 --> 54:03.048
He was dancing...

54:04.249 --> 54:05.785
Right here with someone.

54:05.818 --> 54:06.786
Yeah.

54:07.853 --> 54:09.655
He often does

54:09.689 --> 54:10.690
do that.

54:13.458 --> 54:14.960
And tonight you
wanted it to be you.

54:18.731 --> 54:20.032
* I don't know why or when

54:22.201 --> 54:23.736
It's all in the family.

54:26.105 --> 54:27.740
* I feel suspended

54:29.108 --> 54:30.943
* In the air

54:32.377 --> 54:34.714
* Somewhere between

54:35.314 --> 54:37.382
* The dream and the memory *

54:37.416 --> 54:38.818
I never thought of you
as a dancer.

54:40.853 --> 54:41.921
Crazy about it.

54:43.188 --> 54:44.790
Call me Bojangles at the office.

54:52.998 --> 54:54.934
In all those years, I
never saw you do this,

54:56.201 --> 54:57.803
meet a girl here with champagne.

54:58.437 --> 54:59.839
I never did it before.

55:01.406 --> 55:02.908
You never had to before.

55:06.245 --> 55:07.780
Is it impossible to believe

55:07.813 --> 55:10.716
that I want to dance with the
prettiest girl at the party?

55:13.118 --> 55:14.787
Thank you.

55:14.820 --> 55:16.455
Yes, it is impossible
to believe.

55:18.290 --> 55:19.759
Then you don't know me.

55:23.195 --> 55:24.363
Oh, I almost forgot.

55:27.867 --> 55:29.227
The rest of
the message from David.

55:31.103 --> 55:32.004
Oh...

55:34.173 --> 55:35.340
Thanks.

55:35.908 --> 55:36.942
I needed that.

55:38.077 --> 55:39.411
What am I doing?

55:39.444 --> 55:40.980
I should never...
No, no. I apologize.

55:41.013 --> 55:43.916
I should never... You have
my handprint on your face.

55:45.250 --> 55:48.087
Maybe it's better if you pick
up your messages in person.

55:48.120 --> 55:49.388
You'll see David tomorrow.

55:50.990 --> 55:51.857
Good night.

56:08.073 --> 56:10.776
Mack, I'm going to stay out
here for the next two days.

56:10.810 --> 56:13.779
Cancel whatever I've got
and reschedule.

56:13.813 --> 56:15.933
Have the plane stand by for 9:00 am.
Tomorrow morning.

56:16.415 --> 56:17.817
And set up the Vineyard cottage.

56:18.951 --> 56:21.921
I don't know. Um...
Flowers. Candles. Singers.

56:21.954 --> 56:23.388
Wonderful party, Linus. Thanks.

56:23.422 --> 56:24.790
Call David's secretary.

56:24.824 --> 56:26.144
It's the only thing
she ever does.

56:26.325 --> 56:27.459
Linus.

56:28.828 --> 56:29.929
Why not?

56:29.962 --> 56:32.064
Well, hell, I'm up.
You're up.

56:32.097 --> 56:34.166
You weren't? Well...
Call her anyway.

56:35.367 --> 56:36.501
Thank you very much for coming.

56:36.535 --> 56:37.937
Good to see you.
Good night.

56:41.606 --> 56:43.442
(SIGHING) Jesus.

56:44.109 --> 56:45.044
Dog.

56:50.182 --> 56:52.117
Frank, can I...

56:52.151 --> 56:54.186
What is it, an epidemic
of sleeping sickness?

56:54.553 --> 56:56.055
Okay, listen.

56:57.256 --> 56:58.557
David can't stand pain,

56:58.590 --> 57:01.360
so I want you to give him
a combination of morphine

57:01.393 --> 57:02.995
and I don't...

57:04.196 --> 57:06.065
Okay. Not morphine.

57:06.098 --> 57:09.168
But something strong and
mixed with a sleeping tablet

57:09.201 --> 57:10.469
like Halcion.

57:12.872 --> 57:14.439
They haven't proved that, Frank.

57:15.574 --> 57:17.109
Ah, we have no idea.

57:17.142 --> 57:18.277
Maude thinks they were
left on the chair

57:18.310 --> 57:19.578
by some guest.

57:21.046 --> 57:22.486
He's not going to sue
his own mother.

57:24.049 --> 57:25.084
Well, he's not me.

57:27.286 --> 57:29.486
MAUDE: Wait, you're not going
to work that way, are you?

57:29.922 --> 57:31.023
Could you give us a moment?

57:31.056 --> 57:32.958
Sure, Mr. Larrabee.

57:32.992 --> 57:35.427
Tyson say anything after
I left last night?

57:35.460 --> 57:37.129
He wondered where
everybody'd gone.

57:38.497 --> 57:40.199
Maybe I should talk to Sabrina.

57:41.500 --> 57:43.035
And say what?

57:43.068 --> 57:45.938
"Sabrina, you're very lovely,

57:45.971 --> 57:48.507
"but David has
a short attention span,

57:48.540 --> 57:49.942
"and he's just
jerking your chain."

57:51.510 --> 57:53.979
Can I say that to a woman,
"jerking your chain"?

57:54.013 --> 57:55.280
When is Elizabeth due back?

57:55.314 --> 57:58.050
Thursday. Should we try
to get her back sooner?

57:58.083 --> 58:00.285
No. I don't want him trying
to break off the engagement.

58:00.319 --> 58:01.987
This all happened in 24 hours.

58:02.021 --> 58:04.356
I can make it
un-happen in 48.

58:04.389 --> 58:06.892
I like Sabrina.
I always have.

58:06.926 --> 58:08.527
But I'm not about to kiss
off a billion dollars.

58:08.560 --> 58:10.040
I don't care what she
did to her hair.

58:21.206 --> 58:22.074
Good morning.

58:23.208 --> 58:24.576
Morning.

58:24.609 --> 58:25.809
I'll take you up to see David.

58:28.080 --> 58:29.081
Thank you.

58:29.714 --> 58:30.950
(SNORING)

58:31.550 --> 58:32.918
SABRINA: David?

58:37.389 --> 58:38.958
David?
Can he hear me?

58:40.292 --> 58:41.293
David!

58:50.569 --> 58:51.971
Sabrina.

58:52.504 --> 58:53.572
Hi.

58:54.239 --> 58:55.174
Hi.

58:55.707 --> 58:56.908
Hi.

58:58.677 --> 59:01.280
Did the dry cleaners
have your car?

59:06.151 --> 59:07.019
How do you feel?

59:07.652 --> 59:08.920
I didn't get there.

59:09.421 --> 59:10.289
(GIGGLING)

59:11.023 --> 59:12.057
Did I?

59:14.326 --> 59:15.326
Are you in a lot of pain?

59:15.760 --> 59:17.329
Am I in a lot of pain?

59:21.633 --> 59:23.035
Look at your little hand.

59:26.738 --> 59:28.974
Guess what happened to me.

59:29.008 --> 59:30.309
(SNIFFING)

59:30.342 --> 59:32.411
I... I know.
I know.

59:32.444 --> 59:33.345
I feel awful.

59:34.346 --> 59:35.547
Me, too.

59:37.449 --> 59:38.369
How do you feel, Linus?

59:40.285 --> 59:41.753
(CHUCKLING)

59:41.786 --> 59:43.466
You're falling a little
behind here, David.

59:44.189 --> 59:45.469
Do you want me to stay with you?

59:46.525 --> 59:49.294
Listen, we got you
a terrific nurse

59:49.328 --> 59:50.996
and a two-day supply
of red Jell-O.

59:52.797 --> 59:53.965
He really should rest.

01:00:01.573 --> 01:00:03.008
Isn't Mr. Linus
going in?

01:00:03.042 --> 01:00:04.543
He has other work today.

01:00:04.576 --> 01:00:06.378
Oh, very good, Madame.

01:00:06.411 --> 01:00:08.180
I'm sure he'll be more
responsive next time.

01:00:09.348 --> 01:00:10.349
Don't worry.

01:00:11.116 --> 01:00:12.151
See you.

01:00:13.585 --> 01:00:14.986
Thank you.

01:00:17.389 --> 01:00:19.191
Uh, you know, um,

01:00:20.659 --> 01:00:22.294
I was wondering.

01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:23.695
We have this summer
cottage on the Vineyard

01:00:23.728 --> 01:00:25.530
we never use anymore.

01:00:25.564 --> 01:00:26.804
I want to put it on the market.

01:00:28.067 --> 01:00:29.768
I was going to have
a few pictures taken,

01:00:29.801 --> 01:00:32.337
you know, the kind that make
it look bigger than it is.

01:00:32.704 --> 01:00:34.439
Mm-hmm.

01:00:34.473 --> 01:00:36.675
I understand you have an
interest in photography.

01:00:37.642 --> 01:00:39.178
I thought you might
like to take them.

01:00:40.745 --> 01:00:42.614
Trip would be no trouble.

01:00:42.647 --> 01:00:44.049
Helicopter could
pick us up here.

01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:45.184
Plane's at Republic.

01:00:52.757 --> 01:00:53.797
Why, is that a lot to ask?

01:01:13.678 --> 01:01:15.180
Saves all that time
fighting traffic.

01:01:16.315 --> 01:01:17.716
And all those tollbooths.

01:02:05.364 --> 01:02:07.666
No, thanks. Something to
drink, Miss Fairchild?

01:02:07.699 --> 01:02:09.534
Uh, Sabrina.
What a beautiful name!

01:02:09.568 --> 01:02:11.136
Carol.

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:12.637
Sorry, Mr. Larrabee.
Can I get you...

01:02:12.671 --> 01:02:13.505
Pellegrino.

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:15.840
Same.

01:02:15.874 --> 01:02:17.509
Mack, anything from Granger?

01:02:18.577 --> 01:02:19.544
Anybody else at SEC?

01:02:20.845 --> 01:02:22.605
Tell him I'll call him
back as soon as I can.

01:02:24.383 --> 01:02:26.785
So... That really is
a beautiful name.

01:02:26.818 --> 01:02:27.819
How did you get it?

01:02:29.488 --> 01:02:30.422
My father's reading.

01:02:31.823 --> 01:02:33.525
It's in a poem.

01:02:33.558 --> 01:02:34.426
Oh?

01:02:36.561 --> 01:02:38.830
"Sabrina fair,
Listen where thou art sitting

01:02:38.863 --> 01:02:41.766
"Under the glassy,
cool, translucent wave,

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.568
"In twisted braids
of lilies knitting

01:02:43.602 --> 01:02:45.537
"The loose train of thy
amber-dropping hair..."

01:02:46.705 --> 01:02:48.065
"Amber-dropping
hair." That's so...

01:02:48.207 --> 01:02:49.574
Carol.
I'm sorry.

01:03:00.385 --> 01:03:01.620
(GIGGLING)

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:03.422
It's... It's an
incredible airplane.

01:03:04.456 --> 01:03:05.524
It's beautiful.

01:03:06.491 --> 01:03:07.926
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:03:09.294 --> 01:03:10.295
Oh. Yes.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:14.191
Don't you ever
look out the window?

01:03:14.999 --> 01:03:16.568
When I have time.

01:03:17.769 --> 01:03:18.937
What happened to
all that time we saved

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:20.272
taking the helicopter?

01:03:22.741 --> 01:03:23.808
I'm storing it up.

01:03:24.643 --> 01:03:25.477
No, you're not.

01:03:30.715 --> 01:03:32.284
So your little poem.

01:03:33.252 --> 01:03:34.219
What does it mean?

01:03:36.388 --> 01:03:38.323
It's the story of a water sprite

01:03:38.357 --> 01:03:40.237
who saved a virgin from a
fate worse than death.

01:03:41.693 --> 01:03:42.853
Hmm. And Sabrina's
the virgin.

01:03:43.262 --> 01:03:44.463
Sabrina's the savior.

01:04:01.045 --> 01:04:02.281
(SHUTTER CLICKING)

01:04:12.957 --> 01:04:14.493
SABRINA: Is it always
like this?

01:04:14.526 --> 01:04:16.328
LINUS: I don't know. I
haven't been here in years.

01:04:16.361 --> 01:04:17.629
How can you have
a place like this

01:04:17.662 --> 01:04:19.331
and never come here?

01:04:19.698 --> 01:04:20.632
Um...

01:04:23.402 --> 01:04:25.370
Gee, I don't know.
I guess I...

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:29.641
...just never had anybody
to share it with.

01:04:32.311 --> 01:04:33.345
I guess.

01:04:34.713 --> 01:04:35.953
You could always hire somebody.

01:04:38.517 --> 01:04:39.951
(LINUS CHUCKLING)

01:04:39.984 --> 01:04:41.586
No, no. Wait. Not me.
The house, please.

01:04:42.987 --> 01:04:44.956
You're in the house.
It humanizes it.

01:04:44.989 --> 01:04:46.525
I don't like having
my picture taken.

01:04:46.558 --> 01:04:47.926
I come out, uh...

01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.028
Looking depressed.

01:04:50.862 --> 01:04:51.696
Are you depressed?

01:04:53.465 --> 01:04:55.934
Maybe that's not
exactly the right word.

01:04:57.669 --> 01:04:58.589
What is the right word?

01:04:59.938 --> 01:05:01.540
I don't know. Um...

01:05:02.874 --> 01:05:04.409
Lonely, maybe.

01:05:08.547 --> 01:05:09.467
You think that's funny?

01:05:10.482 --> 01:05:12.417
No, I just...

01:05:12.451 --> 01:05:13.931
...expected you to say
something else.

01:05:14.986 --> 01:05:15.954
No, I suppose you're right.

01:05:15.987 --> 01:05:17.689
It is... It is funny.

01:05:19.991 --> 01:05:21.993
Linus Larrabee
is lonely. (SIGHING)

01:05:25.997 --> 01:05:27.799
Oh, I'm sorry. I made
you uncomfortable.

01:05:27.832 --> 01:05:29.032
Come on.
Let's get the outside.

01:05:31.002 --> 01:05:33.372
Do you want a view
from the house?

01:05:33.405 --> 01:05:34.473
Uh, sure.

01:05:34.506 --> 01:05:35.574
Which one?

01:05:35.607 --> 01:05:36.247
Um, all of them.

01:05:38.377 --> 01:05:39.678
More isn't always better, Linus.

01:05:39.711 --> 01:05:40.711
Sometimes it's just more.

01:05:42.514 --> 01:05:43.415
Pick one.

01:05:44.849 --> 01:05:46.385
I don't know anything about...

01:05:46.418 --> 01:05:48.098
Just look. Don't take a picture.
Just look.

01:05:51.790 --> 01:05:54.626
Uh... (SIGHING) Ocean,
ocean, ocean, ocean.

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:56.060
Quaint little fishing village.

01:05:56.094 --> 01:05:57.095
Ocean, ocean.

01:05:58.663 --> 01:06:00.599
Lighthouse. Guy going
into the lighthouse.

01:06:03.134 --> 01:06:04.469
There's a job for you.

01:06:05.404 --> 01:06:07.105
What must that be like?

01:06:08.507 --> 01:06:10.108
What kind of a guy

01:06:10.141 --> 01:06:11.743
takes a job
keeping a lighthouse?

01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:20.410
Every time I look through
a camera, I'm surprised.

01:06:21.586 --> 01:06:24.055
It's like finding yourself
in the middle of a story

01:06:24.088 --> 01:06:25.790
like you just did.

01:06:25.824 --> 01:06:28.727
What kind of a guy takes a
job keeping a lighthouse?

01:06:30.462 --> 01:06:32.897
I think I've been taking
pictures all my life,

01:06:32.931 --> 01:06:34.999
long before I ever had a camera.

01:06:35.734 --> 01:06:37.035
(PHONE RINGING)

01:06:38.102 --> 01:06:39.571
Excuse me.

01:06:42.574 --> 01:06:43.608
Well, call him back, mother.

01:06:43.642 --> 01:06:44.809
Raise the offer half a point.

01:06:44.843 --> 01:06:46.044
No more.

01:06:46.578 --> 01:06:47.979
Here? Lousy.

01:06:48.012 --> 01:06:49.981
So far I'm more affected
than she is.

01:06:50.014 --> 01:06:51.683
I damn near cried twice.

01:06:52.917 --> 01:06:55.117
I'm running out of time, here.
I don't know what to try.

01:06:55.587 --> 01:06:57.822
Okay, finished.

01:06:57.856 --> 01:06:59.558
Well, we'll have some lunch,

01:06:59.591 --> 01:07:01.560
and then you probably ought to

01:07:02.627 --> 01:07:04.307
get a look at the island
while you're here.

01:07:04.829 --> 01:07:06.665
LINUS: You miss Paris?

01:07:06.698 --> 01:07:08.833
SABRINA: Not yet.
But I will.

01:07:08.867 --> 01:07:10.101
LINUS: You liked it
there, huh?

01:07:10.134 --> 01:07:11.903
SABRINA: I loved it.

01:07:11.936 --> 01:07:13.972
You'd probably hate it.

01:07:14.005 --> 01:07:15.173
LINUS: What? Why?

01:07:15.974 --> 01:07:17.842
Well, it's all about pleasure.

01:07:17.876 --> 01:07:19.110
They work as hard as anyone.

01:07:19.143 --> 01:07:21.063
They just know when to
quit and enjoy themselves.

01:07:24.182 --> 01:07:26.818
Oh, what a beautiful building!

01:07:27.952 --> 01:07:30.021
Nobody builds
with brick anymore.

01:07:30.054 --> 01:07:31.790
That's, uh, late 1800's.

01:07:33.725 --> 01:07:36.528
You know, in Paris, they'd
consider that brand new.

01:07:36.561 --> 01:07:38.463
I hope they don't tear it down.

01:07:38.497 --> 01:07:40.699
They won't. I own it.
That whole block.

01:07:51.543 --> 01:07:53.383
I donated it to the village
as a halfway house.

01:07:56.014 --> 01:07:57.448
You know.

01:07:58.650 --> 01:08:00.451
Jails are full of guys
that never had a break.

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.554
Look at this guy picking cans.

01:08:03.087 --> 01:08:04.656
They get back to the wall,

01:08:04.689 --> 01:08:06.658
commit some kind of petty crime.

01:08:06.691 --> 01:08:08.459
They're stuck. They're outsiders
for the rest of their lives.

01:08:08.893 --> 01:08:10.028
It's not fair.

01:08:10.061 --> 01:08:13.532
Their only chance
is a halfway house

01:08:13.565 --> 01:08:15.525
that'll help them get their
feet under them again.

01:08:19.770 --> 01:08:21.171
Uh, excuse me.

01:08:21.205 --> 01:08:22.874
Uh... Could you
take a picture of us?

01:08:23.675 --> 01:08:24.776
Yeah.

01:08:27.679 --> 01:08:29.147
It's, uh, that one.

01:08:37.121 --> 01:08:38.657
(SHUTTER CLICKING)

01:08:55.707 --> 01:08:56.841
Are you done?

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:00.290
I don't think I can eat anymore.

01:09:01.045 --> 01:09:02.645
It's too late to give
them their freedom.

01:09:05.082 --> 01:09:07.551
You know, you are not exactly
what people say you are.

01:09:07.986 --> 01:09:09.187
Oh, yeah?

01:09:11.221 --> 01:09:12.102
What do they say I am?

01:09:13.825 --> 01:09:15.093
Oh, you know.

01:09:16.728 --> 01:09:17.629
No.

01:09:19.096 --> 01:09:20.231
Well...

01:09:21.832 --> 01:09:23.712
That you're the world's
only living heart donor.

01:09:25.136 --> 01:09:27.238
Oh. That.

01:09:27.270 --> 01:09:28.840
And... How does this one go?

01:09:28.872 --> 01:09:29.841
Um...

01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:34.245
"He thinks that morals
are paintings on walls

01:09:34.278 --> 01:09:35.947
"and scruples
are money in Russia."

01:09:38.349 --> 01:09:39.283
Well, that's droll.

01:09:40.384 --> 01:09:41.653
Then there's my favorite...

01:09:41.685 --> 01:09:42.845
No, no, no.
I get the picture.

01:09:43.721 --> 01:09:44.923
That's enough.

01:09:48.225 --> 01:09:49.728
Do you remember
the rainy afternoon

01:09:49.761 --> 01:09:50.595
we spent together?

01:09:50.995 --> 01:09:51.863
Uh...

01:09:54.032 --> 01:09:55.600
My father had, uh,

01:09:56.701 --> 01:09:58.703
had driven your mother
and David into town

01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:01.205
for a...
A music lesson.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:02.874
How old was he?

01:10:03.675 --> 01:10:05.243
I don't know.
14,15.

01:10:05.910 --> 01:10:07.278
That would be the oboe.

01:10:07.311 --> 01:10:08.913
The oboe?

01:10:08.947 --> 01:10:10.281
Yeah. It was
a misunderstanding.

01:10:10.314 --> 01:10:12.817
He thought he was going
to take hobo lessons.

01:10:16.354 --> 01:10:17.989
It was a rainy afternoon, huh?

01:10:19.190 --> 01:10:20.591
Stormy.

01:10:22.794 --> 01:10:24.028
I was afraid,

01:10:24.062 --> 01:10:26.230
and I came into your house

01:10:26.264 --> 01:10:27.832
and tried to turn on a lamp,

01:10:27.866 --> 01:10:29.934
but I got a shock.

01:10:29.968 --> 01:10:31.648
And I thought I'd been
struck by lightning.

01:10:34.806 --> 01:10:36.941
And you stayed with me
all afternoon

01:10:38.309 --> 01:10:40.111
till my father came home.

01:10:40.144 --> 01:10:41.880
And you didn't cry.

01:10:41.913 --> 01:10:42.753
You were a brave kid.

01:10:43.081 --> 01:10:45.183
No.

01:10:45.216 --> 01:10:47.218
I was more afraid of you
than being electrocuted.

01:10:47.251 --> 01:10:48.086
Everybody was.

01:10:56.895 --> 01:10:58.495
Is that the reason
you never got married?

01:10:59.363 --> 01:11:00.799
Aw, you probably don't
believe in marriage.

01:11:00.832 --> 01:11:01.900
Yes, I do.

01:11:04.703 --> 01:11:06.004
That's why I never got married.

01:11:09.473 --> 01:11:10.675
David, on the other hand,

01:11:10.709 --> 01:11:12.076
believes in the tooth fairy.

01:11:14.212 --> 01:11:15.814
That's why I like him.

01:11:15.847 --> 01:11:18.817
I like him, too. Matter
of fact, I love him.

01:11:18.850 --> 01:11:21.285
I just don't know
what to do with him.

01:11:21.319 --> 01:11:23.788
You know, when he was a kid, he used
to love to come into the office.

01:11:23.822 --> 01:11:26.057
He'd sit behind my father's
desk and write memos

01:11:27.091 --> 01:11:28.860
and read the ticker tape.

01:11:30.328 --> 01:11:32.430
One day, he just stopped,

01:11:32.463 --> 01:11:34.699
and I can't figure out...

01:11:34.733 --> 01:11:37.101
Are those the only things
people say about me?

01:11:37.135 --> 01:11:38.002
(LAUGHING)

01:11:53.151 --> 01:11:54.819
It was a nice day.

01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:58.089
You were a little...

01:11:58.957 --> 01:12:01.125
...tough on me,
I thought.

01:12:01.159 --> 01:12:04.095
I guess you're used to being
treated very carefully.

01:12:05.496 --> 01:12:07.298
When will you have the pictures?

01:12:07.331 --> 01:12:08.499
Tomorrow.

01:12:08.532 --> 01:12:10.835
Could you drop them
by the office?

01:12:11.169 --> 01:12:12.103
Sure.

01:12:14.172 --> 01:12:15.339
Well, good night, then...

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:16.875
Sabrina Fair.

01:12:19.844 --> 01:12:20.745
Linus?

01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:22.847
Yeah?

01:12:23.982 --> 01:12:25.850
My father once asked David

01:12:26.851 --> 01:12:28.953
why he stopped
coming to the office,

01:12:30.822 --> 01:12:33.324
and David said, "What
do they need me for?

01:12:33.357 --> 01:12:34.158
"Linus is there."

01:12:38.129 --> 01:12:40.765
Listen, I do real work
in the real world.

01:12:40.799 --> 01:12:42.466
David watches
from the North Shore.

01:12:43.534 --> 01:12:45.303
I know you work
in the real world,

01:12:45.336 --> 01:12:47.806
and you're awfully good at it.

01:12:47.839 --> 01:12:50.199
I'll bet you haven't made a wrong
move since you were three.

01:12:52.510 --> 01:12:54.078
But that's work.

01:12:55.579 --> 01:12:57.015
Where do you live, Linus?

01:13:02.954 --> 01:13:04.222
It was a nice day.

01:13:05.356 --> 01:13:06.424
Thanks.

01:13:17.468 --> 01:13:19.003
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:13:19.037 --> 01:13:20.138
It's open.

01:13:22.941 --> 01:13:23.908
Hi.

01:13:24.608 --> 01:13:25.568
Where were you, in town?

01:13:26.310 --> 01:13:27.979
On Martha's Vineyard.

01:13:29.848 --> 01:13:32.083
Linus wanted me
to take some pictures.

01:13:33.317 --> 01:13:34.785
Linus did?

01:13:39.991 --> 01:13:42.160
I love so many things
about you, Dad.

01:13:43.194 --> 01:13:45.463
But you know what I love
best of all?

01:13:47.565 --> 01:13:49.567
That you decided
to become a chauffeur

01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.469
because you wanted
to have time to read.

01:13:53.371 --> 01:13:55.239
All my life I've pictured you

01:13:56.574 --> 01:13:57.876
sitting in the front seat

01:13:57.909 --> 01:14:00.111
of a long succession of cars,

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:02.213
waiting for the
Larrabees and reading.

01:14:03.247 --> 01:14:04.883
We had baked clams.

01:14:08.086 --> 01:14:09.020
Linus baked them.

01:14:13.557 --> 01:14:15.126
I used to be so afraid of him.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.495
It's appropriate.

01:14:18.662 --> 01:14:20.064
What was he like as a child?

01:14:21.065 --> 01:14:21.933
Shorter.

01:14:33.978 --> 01:14:36.314
I look out the window,
and I see someone.

01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:38.082
It is a young woman.

01:14:38.116 --> 01:14:41.552
So I say, "What is a young
woman doing in the courtyard

01:14:41.585 --> 01:14:43.287
"at this time of night?"

01:14:43.321 --> 01:14:46.557
So I'm looking and looking,
and I see this Sabrina.

01:14:46.590 --> 01:14:49.027
She's talking.
Who's she talking to?

01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:51.963
A man! Not her daddy.
He's not as tall.

01:14:51.996 --> 01:14:54.465
It was Linus. Sabrina
went out with Linus.

01:14:54.498 --> 01:14:56.067
It was Mr. Linus.

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:57.668
Sabrina went out
with Linus Larrabee?

01:14:57.701 --> 01:14:59.270
That's too weird.

01:14:59.303 --> 01:15:00.504
I thought he was gay.

01:15:00.538 --> 01:15:02.173
Mr. Linus
is not a gay.

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:04.208
It's not "a" gay, Rosa.
It's just "gay."

01:15:04.242 --> 01:15:06.044
Linus Larrabee is gay?

01:15:06.077 --> 01:15:07.478
That makes me like him better.

01:15:07.511 --> 01:15:09.613
Linus Larrabee
is a heterosexual.

01:15:11.582 --> 01:15:13.017
(DOG BARKING)

01:15:18.089 --> 01:15:19.057
Shh.

01:15:19.623 --> 01:15:20.558
He's still sleeping.

01:15:22.426 --> 01:15:24.062
Oh. Is that normal?

01:15:24.095 --> 01:15:26.464
When you're taking what
he's taking, it is.

01:15:26.497 --> 01:15:27.817
But he wakes up
from time to time.

01:15:28.499 --> 01:15:29.459
Has he asked for anyone?

01:15:30.368 --> 01:15:31.235
Bert and Ernie.

01:15:34.438 --> 01:15:35.539
Um...

01:15:36.707 --> 01:15:38.476
Could you tell him
Sabrina was here?

01:15:38.509 --> 01:15:39.944
I could tell him
the pope was here,

01:15:39.978 --> 01:15:41.338
but I don't think
it'd make a dent.

01:15:43.047 --> 01:15:46.150
I'm going to the city,
but I'll be back by 7:00.

01:15:46.184 --> 01:15:46.985
Could you tell him?

01:15:50.388 --> 01:15:53.191
MACK: Quarterly reports from
publishing will be online at 4:00.

01:15:53.224 --> 01:15:57.128
International wants a
teleconference at 5:15.

01:15:57.161 --> 01:15:59.097
Mack, you know that old brick building
that we own out at the Vineyard?

01:15:59.130 --> 01:16:00.064
Yes.

01:16:01.765 --> 01:16:03.045
You ever heard me referred to as

01:16:03.067 --> 01:16:04.568
"the world's only
living heart donor"?

(LAUGHING)

01:16:10.108 --> 01:16:12.343
Have the Rons find out
if there's any tax advantage

01:16:12.376 --> 01:16:14.256
to donating that building
to the town out there.

And if there isn't?

01:16:16.380 --> 01:16:17.215
Then forget it.

01:16:20.118 --> 01:16:22.653
Oh, and I want
two tickets tonight

for whatever Broadway show
nobody can get tickets for.

01:16:27.158 --> 01:16:28.959
And a table
at the Carlyle for drinks.

01:16:29.593 --> 01:16:30.628
For whom?

01:16:31.195 --> 01:16:32.096
Me.

01:16:34.632 --> 01:16:35.992
I know. I seldom go
to the theater.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.102
Seldom?

01:16:38.136 --> 01:16:39.256
Okay. I'm not
a theater buff.

01:16:39.537 --> 01:16:40.571
Buff?

01:16:47.211 --> 01:16:48.112
Okay.

01:16:50.114 --> 01:16:53.051
That means that
the actors periodically

01:16:53.084 --> 01:16:54.524
will dance about
and burst into song.

Mack, forget the thing
about the tax advantage.

01:16:58.256 --> 01:17:00.416
Tell the Rons I want that
building donated to the town.

01:17:02.593 --> 01:17:04.995
And I want it used
as a halfway house.

01:17:35.593 --> 01:17:36.794
Come in.

01:17:40.098 --> 01:17:40.798
Hi.

01:17:41.732 --> 01:17:42.766
Hello.

01:17:46.837 --> 01:17:49.240
Sit down. Make
yourself comfortable.

01:17:49.273 --> 01:17:50.241
Thanks.

01:17:54.445 --> 01:17:55.379
Wow.

01:17:56.714 --> 01:17:58.182
It's, uh...

01:17:59.117 --> 01:18:00.050
Big.

01:18:01.119 --> 01:18:02.720
This is where I do
that real work

01:18:02.753 --> 01:18:03.721
in the real world,

01:18:04.555 --> 01:18:06.157
instead of living.

01:18:07.658 --> 01:18:09.327
Oh... You remembered.

01:18:10.828 --> 01:18:12.630
Doesn't come up every day.

01:18:12.663 --> 01:18:13.743
Would you like some coffee?

01:18:14.265 --> 01:18:15.399
No, thanks.

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:17.868
Some of these are very good.

01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:19.341
(CHUCKLING) Don't sound
so surprised.

01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:21.405
I'm not.

01:18:24.808 --> 01:18:26.310
This is an unusual
view of the house.

01:18:29.647 --> 01:18:31.149
Oh. Um...

01:18:32.483 --> 01:18:35.353
Well, you said you wanted
it to look bigger.

01:18:36.154 --> 01:18:37.155
Sorry.

01:18:37.655 --> 01:18:39.089
Then... No. You have...

01:18:41.592 --> 01:18:42.493
Here.

01:18:50.434 --> 01:18:52.770
You got to admit,
it's beautiful.

01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:58.376
I probably would,
if you'd let me.

01:18:58.842 --> 01:19:00.278
(CHUCKLING)

01:19:01.579 --> 01:19:02.813
I found myself in Paris.

01:19:05.616 --> 01:19:07.218
A friend said that.

01:19:07.251 --> 01:19:08.118
You were missing?

01:19:08.719 --> 01:19:09.753
Yes.

01:19:12.656 --> 01:19:14.458
I once was lost
and now am found.

01:19:15.593 --> 01:19:16.394
You're making fun.

01:19:17.461 --> 01:19:18.296
It's my turn.

01:19:24.868 --> 01:19:25.803
You're very photogenic.

01:19:27.638 --> 01:19:28.638
It's 'cause I'm handsome.

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:31.175
Mmm, no, that's not it.

01:19:32.210 --> 01:19:34.212
But not as handsome as David.

01:19:34.245 --> 01:19:36.214
Nobody's as handsome as David.

01:19:37.381 --> 01:19:39.183
Even David.

01:19:39.217 --> 01:19:42.420
Don't tell him that
till he's fully recovered.

01:19:42.453 --> 01:19:44.322
Are you sure I can't
get you anything?

01:19:44.355 --> 01:19:46.490
Cafe au lait, snails,
french fries?

01:19:46.524 --> 01:19:47.791
(CHUCKLING)

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:50.328
Theater tickets?

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:52.463
Theater tickets?

01:19:54.565 --> 01:19:57.201
I thought I'd take
my first step towards...

01:19:57.235 --> 01:19:58.515
What is all that French stuff...

01:19:58.536 --> 01:20:00.304
The good life,
knowing when to quit?

01:20:03.907 --> 01:20:05.175
Maybe it's a bad idea.

01:20:10.013 --> 01:20:11.582
Know what's a good idea?

01:20:17.388 --> 01:20:19.357
SABRINA: It was my
favorite food in France.

01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:20.758
There's this little
place in Pigalle.

01:20:20.791 --> 01:20:22.926
I ate there
at least twice a week.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:24.462
It's good.
Enjoy.

01:20:35.339 --> 01:20:37.908
Oh, it's really so much better
if you eat with your hands.

01:20:37.941 --> 01:20:39.543
Do you mind?
No, no.

01:20:39.777 --> 01:20:41.479
No. Ow!

01:20:41.512 --> 01:20:42.913
Not since I made
that contribution

01:20:42.946 --> 01:20:44.915
to the NYU burn unit.
(CHUCKLING)

01:20:50.721 --> 01:20:51.655
It's good.
Very good.

01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:00.931
It's interesting. Have to
try it with soup sometime.

01:21:00.964 --> 01:21:01.999
(LAUGHING)

01:21:08.672 --> 01:21:10.374
(TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

01:21:44.875 --> 01:21:47.611
SABRINA: I used to walk
everywhere in Paris.

01:21:47.645 --> 01:21:50.614
I used to walk from Montmartre
down into the center of the town.

01:21:52.049 --> 01:21:54.585
Along the Seine
there's a 4-mile walk

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:57.655
that goes from Ile Saint-Germain
to the Pont d'Austerlitz.

01:21:58.789 --> 01:22:00.524
It takes you past
all the bridges of Paris,

01:22:01.892 --> 01:22:03.327
23 of them.

01:22:04.362 --> 01:22:05.696
You find one you love

01:22:05.729 --> 01:22:09.467
and you go there every day with
your coffee and your journal,

01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:11.969
and you listen to the river.

01:22:13.537 --> 01:22:14.417
What does it tell you?

01:22:16.874 --> 01:22:18.709
That's between
you and the river.

01:22:23.013 --> 01:22:26.316
You know, it's funny. Listening
to you talk makes me...

01:22:27.951 --> 01:22:29.720
Makes me wonder if I should...

01:22:30.521 --> 01:22:31.622
What?

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:32.523
I don't know.

01:22:33.957 --> 01:22:35.693
Something's different.

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:38.596
I feel... different.

01:22:41.098 --> 01:22:43.000
At work, I... I don't...

01:22:46.136 --> 01:22:47.337
I love the action,

01:22:47.805 --> 01:22:49.039
but, um...

01:22:50.073 --> 01:22:51.008
Sometimes I wonder...

01:22:51.975 --> 01:22:53.611
...lately, especially...

01:22:54.712 --> 01:22:56.079
...been wondering...

01:22:58.416 --> 01:22:59.696
What it would be like...
(SIGHING)

01:22:59.717 --> 01:23:01.519
Um...

01:23:01.552 --> 01:23:04.488
To spend some time in a place
that I love like that,

01:23:04.522 --> 01:23:06.490
and not just a few days, but...

01:23:07.825 --> 01:23:08.626
For a real change.

01:23:10.961 --> 01:23:12.663
Actually, I think I've been
thinking about it a long time.

01:23:12.696 --> 01:23:13.797
I just, um...

01:23:15.165 --> 01:23:16.534
I just didn't know it until...

01:23:17.635 --> 01:23:18.802
Till you, um...

01:23:18.836 --> 01:23:20.037
What exactly are you saying?

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.575
I'm not sure.

01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:28.812
I do what my dad did.

01:23:28.846 --> 01:23:29.780
He...

01:23:31.181 --> 01:23:33.484
(SIGHING) He did
what his dad did.

01:23:35.085 --> 01:23:36.787
My whole life, I've...

01:23:38.722 --> 01:23:40.057
I never chose.

01:23:43.126 --> 01:23:44.806
The past gets deeper,
more familiar, but...

01:23:46.564 --> 01:23:48.084
You're not really
thinking about Paris.

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:51.702
No.

01:23:55.005 --> 01:23:56.674
No, you're probably right.

01:23:57.174 --> 01:23:58.676
How could I be?

01:24:01.512 --> 01:24:02.480
Am I a lost cause then?

01:24:05.883 --> 01:24:07.763
I don't like to think of
anyone as a lost cause.

01:24:13.023 --> 01:24:14.191
(GASPS) What time is it?

01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.695
9:45.

01:24:19.497 --> 01:24:21.817
I forgot I told the nurse to
tell David I'd look in on him.

01:24:22.199 --> 01:24:23.534
He's probably sleeping.

01:24:26.904 --> 01:24:27.738
We can go.

01:24:28.672 --> 01:24:30.007
No, you're right.
I can...

01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:31.875
No. Come on.
Let's walk a little.

01:24:34.645 --> 01:24:36.765
LINUS: Was there anything you
didn't like about Paris?

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:41.652
How expensive everything is.

01:24:43.053 --> 01:24:44.413
Well, I'd have
to learn how to say,

01:24:45.155 --> 01:24:46.757
"I'm just looking."

01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:50.160
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

01:24:51.962 --> 01:24:53.864
How do you say,

01:24:53.897 --> 01:24:55.833
"This is what I want"?

01:24:55.866 --> 01:24:57.234
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

01:25:02.239 --> 01:25:03.841
How do you say...

01:25:05.242 --> 01:25:06.610
"I'm looking at what I want"?

01:25:12.215 --> 01:25:13.784
I don't remember.

01:25:33.937 --> 01:25:36.206
I brought you some tea

01:25:36.239 --> 01:25:38.609
and some flowers to
brighten up your room.

01:25:39.810 --> 01:25:42.613
Have you been watching
Remains of the Day again?

01:25:50.353 --> 01:25:53.557
She can handle herself
with him, you know.

01:25:53.591 --> 01:25:55.292
She's not a little girl anymore.

01:25:55.325 --> 01:25:57.895
It's just she seems... I don't
know, displaced right now.

01:25:59.362 --> 01:26:01.131
She doesn't belong in a mansion.

01:26:01.164 --> 01:26:02.884
She doesn't belong above
the garage, either.

01:26:04.735 --> 01:26:06.637
Most people live in between.

01:26:10.608 --> 01:26:11.848
Have your tea and try to sleep.

01:26:21.018 --> 01:26:22.653
Hi.
SABRINA: David.

01:26:24.121 --> 01:26:26.323
How are you feeling?
Great.

01:26:26.356 --> 01:26:28.558
Just felt like getting
out of bed for a while.

01:26:29.292 --> 01:26:30.812
Mack says you guys
went to the theater?

01:26:31.028 --> 01:26:32.596
Just dinner.

01:26:32.630 --> 01:26:34.197
Moroccan, on the floor.

01:26:35.165 --> 01:26:36.600
Lots of cinnamon.

01:26:36.634 --> 01:26:37.834
What's the word from Calloway?

01:26:38.035 --> 01:26:40.270
I'm healing fast.

01:26:40.303 --> 01:26:41.623
I just can't eat
on the floor yet.

01:26:45.142 --> 01:26:46.309
Well, it was good.
Thanks.

01:26:47.277 --> 01:26:48.437
You heading back to the city?

01:26:50.147 --> 01:26:52.883
No. It's getting kinda late.
I think I'll sleep out here.

01:26:56.987 --> 01:26:57.855
Good night.

01:26:58.689 --> 01:27:00.691
Good night,
Linus. Thanks.

01:27:05.796 --> 01:27:06.830
So...

01:27:07.731 --> 01:27:09.166
You...

01:27:09.199 --> 01:27:10.359
I've been thinking about you.

01:27:11.068 --> 01:27:12.269
Have you?

01:27:13.236 --> 01:27:15.005
What were you thinking?

01:27:15.038 --> 01:27:16.918
I think we never had that
drink in the solarium.

01:27:18.075 --> 01:27:19.943
We never did.

01:27:19.977 --> 01:27:21.111
You sent Linus.

01:27:21.144 --> 01:27:22.680
Ah.

01:27:22.713 --> 01:27:24.353
Are you sure you should
be walking around?

01:27:26.183 --> 01:27:27.284
Hey.

01:27:28.686 --> 01:27:29.886
David, what's going to happen?

01:27:30.854 --> 01:27:32.956
Well, I could probably scare
us up some champagne,

01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:34.658
a couple of Dixie cups.

01:27:34.692 --> 01:27:36.860
I'm through with glasses.

01:27:36.894 --> 01:27:39.329
We could hobble down to the solarium
and pick right back up where...

01:27:39.362 --> 01:27:40.731
No. I meant after that.

01:27:41.231 --> 01:27:42.032
After that?

01:27:45.168 --> 01:27:47.237
Well, shucks.

01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:48.150
Whatever.
I don't know.

01:27:50.107 --> 01:27:50.941
Don't you?

01:27:52.209 --> 01:27:53.811
Well, not exactly.

01:27:54.377 --> 01:27:55.312
Is that so bad?

01:27:58.148 --> 01:27:59.082
No.

01:28:02.853 --> 01:28:04.533
We can talk about all that
later, can't we?

01:28:05.155 --> 01:28:06.323
Yes...

01:28:07.124 --> 01:28:08.358
But tomorrow.

01:28:09.860 --> 01:28:11.328
I really think
you should rest now.

01:28:15.432 --> 01:28:16.433
Okay.

01:28:18.468 --> 01:28:20.437
SABRINA: Good night, David.

01:28:37.955 --> 01:28:39.857
MACK: Good morning, sir.
How was the theater?

01:28:39.890 --> 01:28:41.058
Come in, Mack.

01:28:41.892 --> 01:28:43.861
That bad, huh?

01:28:43.894 --> 01:28:46.129
I want you to get me two tickets
on Air France to Paris,

01:28:46.163 --> 01:28:49.232
one in my name and one in the
name of Sabrina Fairchild.

01:28:49.266 --> 01:28:50.734
That's it.

01:28:50.768 --> 01:28:52.836
What day are we flying?

01:28:52.870 --> 01:28:53.904
Tomorrow.

01:28:56.239 --> 01:28:57.741
Oh! I almost forgot.

01:28:57.775 --> 01:28:59.810
The Tysons are here waiting.

01:29:01.011 --> 01:29:02.091
Did we have an appointment?

01:29:02.545 --> 01:29:03.947
Not in my book.
They showed up.

01:29:03.981 --> 01:29:05.916
I put them in David's office.

01:29:07.150 --> 01:29:08.385
Is my mother in yet?

01:29:08.418 --> 01:29:10.287
I got the same thing
with a nephew.

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:13.056
I gave him a huge office,
but he's never there either.

01:29:13.090 --> 01:29:14.391
So, we use it for lunches.

01:29:14.424 --> 01:29:15.959
These are the invitations.

01:29:15.993 --> 01:29:18.862
We thought we'd use
recycled paper.

01:29:18.896 --> 01:29:21.498
Why does it always look dirty?
Oh, Maude.

01:29:21.531 --> 01:29:24.301
Now, which do you like,
the taupe or the buff?

01:29:24.334 --> 01:29:25.936
What's the problem, Patrick?

01:29:25.969 --> 01:29:28.371
No problem
from our point of view.

01:29:28.405 --> 01:29:30.874
I feel like a... (SIGHING)
What's that word,

01:29:31.541 --> 01:29:32.910
when lots of guys are after you?

01:29:32.943 --> 01:29:33.877
Whore.

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:42.953
I was thinking more, uh...

01:29:42.986 --> 01:29:44.054
Debutante.

01:29:45.956 --> 01:29:49.059
Somebody else wants to be in
bed with Tyson Electronics.

01:29:49.092 --> 01:29:49.893
You know Intermedia?

01:29:50.861 --> 01:29:51.761
Mm-hmm.

01:29:52.362 --> 01:29:54.264
Impressive proposal.

01:29:54.297 --> 01:29:55.833
Cash, stock...

01:29:57.034 --> 01:29:58.802
And they don't want to tell me
how to run the business.

01:29:58.836 --> 01:30:00.938
How flattering for you, Patrick.

01:30:00.971 --> 01:30:02.291
So how did you
leave it with them?

01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:05.575
I told them we're practically
family, you and I.

01:30:05.608 --> 01:30:08.111
I couldn't possibly
entertain their offer

01:30:08.145 --> 01:30:09.079
at this time.

01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:10.881
Good.

01:30:11.849 --> 01:30:13.984
But Elizabeth
came home last night.

01:30:15.418 --> 01:30:17.354
She called David.

01:30:17.387 --> 01:30:18.455
And we got the impression...

01:30:18.488 --> 01:30:19.923
You. You got
the impression.

01:30:22.125 --> 01:30:25.028
I got the impression that he
wasn't as anxious as he should be

01:30:25.062 --> 01:30:26.396
to see her.

01:30:26.429 --> 01:30:28.465
But he's not himself, Patrick.

01:30:29.066 --> 01:30:30.934
He's been injured.

01:30:30.968 --> 01:30:33.937
He's on very heavy medication.

01:30:33.971 --> 01:30:36.206
He wants to be perfect
before he sees her again.

01:30:38.641 --> 01:30:40.377
That's what I thought.

01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:41.544
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

01:30:46.016 --> 01:30:47.217
Hello?

01:30:47.250 --> 01:30:48.385
LINUS: Good morning.

01:30:48.418 --> 01:30:50.253
Linus.

01:30:50.287 --> 01:30:53.390
Listen, would you mind
another trip into the city?

01:30:53.423 --> 01:30:56.259
I've got some business I'd
like to discuss with you.

01:30:56.293 --> 01:30:58.195
Business?
LINUS: Yeah.

01:30:58.228 --> 01:31:00.468
I was wondering if you could
meet me here this afternoon.

01:31:02.432 --> 01:31:04.232
I don't know. There's
something I ought to do.

01:31:06.136 --> 01:31:07.936
It would mean a great
deal to me if you could.

01:31:10.273 --> 01:31:13.110
That little leprechaun was
making a veiled threat.

01:31:14.444 --> 01:31:16.313
There was no veil.

01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:17.981
Should we do something?

01:31:18.681 --> 01:31:20.117
It's under control.

01:31:21.518 --> 01:31:22.953
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.

01:31:24.922 --> 01:31:25.622
What?

01:31:26.323 --> 01:31:27.257
It's a long story.

01:31:30.327 --> 01:31:31.228
I like long stories.

01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:33.863
Well, you won't like this one.

01:31:35.065 --> 01:31:35.966
Try me.

01:31:43.106 --> 01:31:45.342
Things have been
progressing with Sabrina.

01:31:46.343 --> 01:31:47.544
We've... bonded.

01:31:51.181 --> 01:31:53.250
We've been confiding
in each other.

01:31:55.252 --> 01:31:57.154
Last night,
over a handful of chicken,

01:31:57.187 --> 01:32:00.590
I told her I thought my life was
in need of some radical changes.

01:32:02.625 --> 01:32:05.228
I told her I was thinking
about getting away.

01:32:07.330 --> 01:32:08.665
Moving to Paris.

01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.035
She thought that was
a great idea.

01:32:13.503 --> 01:32:14.343
And she believed you?

01:32:15.973 --> 01:32:17.933
More than that, I think she'll
want to go with me.

01:32:18.241 --> 01:32:19.042
How do you know?

01:32:22.379 --> 01:32:25.648
The same way I knew fiber optics
would replace coaxial cable,

01:32:27.117 --> 01:32:29.419
that Intel's chip
would change the industry,

01:32:29.452 --> 01:32:32.589
that Cindy Crawford's House
of Style would be a big hit.

01:32:33.523 --> 01:32:34.591
I just know.

01:32:38.128 --> 01:32:40.563
So here's the way
it'll play out...

01:32:40.597 --> 01:32:42.632
Sabrina will go
to Paris with me,

01:32:42.665 --> 01:32:45.102
a wiser David
will return to Elizabeth,

01:32:47.237 --> 01:32:49.272
I'll come back from Paris
to sign the papers,

01:32:49.306 --> 01:32:50.186
the merger will close.

01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:55.212
We'll make a very large
sum of money,

01:32:55.245 --> 01:32:57.614
and you can
buy a house in Tuscany.

01:32:58.415 --> 01:33:00.150
I have a house in Tuscany.

01:33:01.784 --> 01:33:03.086
What happens to Sabrina?

01:33:03.553 --> 01:33:05.055
She grows up.

01:33:07.324 --> 01:33:09.092
You're going to ditch her?

01:33:10.693 --> 01:33:12.162
My goodness.

01:33:14.397 --> 01:33:17.534
How did you think this was
going to happen, Mother?

01:33:17.567 --> 01:33:20.047
Did you think there was some nice
way to do it? Some sweet way?

01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:22.072
I don't know what I thought.

01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:24.674
I just don't want
Sabrina to be...

01:33:24.707 --> 01:33:26.209
What, unhappy?

01:33:29.446 --> 01:33:32.149
In all these years, you've never
once seen the face of somebody

01:33:32.182 --> 01:33:34.382
the day after we've taken over
their business, have you.

01:33:34.684 --> 01:33:37.387
You're at the hairdresser
or celebrating.

01:33:42.059 --> 01:33:43.660
I think I'm getting old.

01:33:44.727 --> 01:33:45.728
I feel terrible.

01:33:46.463 --> 01:33:47.330
Take a pill.

01:33:48.631 --> 01:33:50.567
Watch it.

01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:51.701
I'm still your mother.

01:33:54.271 --> 01:33:55.705
And you taught me
everything I know.

01:33:58.541 --> 01:34:00.277
I didn't teach you this.

01:34:01.444 --> 01:34:04.347
Excuse me. I have
some calls to return.

01:34:30.240 --> 01:34:32.242
WOMAN:
* Closer, together, now

01:34:36.846 --> 01:34:38.415
* Oh, oh, oh *

01:34:51.661 --> 01:34:52.495
Miss Fairchild.

01:34:53.363 --> 01:34:54.797
He was expecting you
much earlier.

01:34:54.831 --> 01:34:56.333
I'll tell him know
that you're here.

01:34:56.366 --> 01:34:58.668
Maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

01:34:58.701 --> 01:35:00.203
Don't tell him I'm here.

01:35:00.237 --> 01:35:02.105
But he pays me to tell him.

01:35:02.672 --> 01:35:03.473
Sabrina Fairchild.

01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:12.081
(SIGHING)

01:35:12.715 --> 01:35:13.850
I was beginning to worry.

01:35:15.352 --> 01:35:16.253
Why?

01:35:17.587 --> 01:35:19.756
That's a favorite
question of yours.

01:35:21.724 --> 01:35:23.160
Didn't you want to come?

01:35:23.826 --> 01:35:25.262
Uh, um...

01:35:27.864 --> 01:35:29.098
I asked you first.

01:35:29.799 --> 01:35:30.867
I asked you second.

01:35:33.536 --> 01:35:34.471
Uh...

01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:36.773
I've been, uh...

01:35:38.341 --> 01:35:40.543
I've been wandering around
Manhattan all afternoon.

01:35:41.478 --> 01:35:42.379
Um...

01:35:43.846 --> 01:35:45.682
It's something

01:35:45.715 --> 01:35:47.350
to do with maybe...

01:35:49.286 --> 01:35:50.553
...never seeing
you again.

01:35:50.587 --> 01:35:51.921
But that's ridiculous

01:35:51.954 --> 01:35:54.324
because we don't, um...

01:35:55.525 --> 01:35:57.126
Don't have to, uh...

01:35:58.195 --> 01:35:59.529
Well, except by accident...

01:35:59.562 --> 01:36:01.130
And, uh...

01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:06.269
How could that be a problem?

01:36:06.303 --> 01:36:07.337
(SIGHING)

01:36:09.339 --> 01:36:10.340
Um...

01:36:11.874 --> 01:36:13.443
If two people...

01:36:14.844 --> 01:36:16.413
I asked you first.

01:36:20.617 --> 01:36:21.884
Well, um...

01:36:22.752 --> 01:36:24.821
What you said, whatever it is,

01:36:26.623 --> 01:36:28.558
makes what I was going to say...

01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:31.894
...obsolete, I think.

01:36:34.564 --> 01:36:35.565
Obsolete?

01:36:38.901 --> 01:36:40.303
Irrelevant.

01:36:41.971 --> 01:36:44.173
Okay. I like "irrelevant."

01:36:47.710 --> 01:36:48.845
Do you?

01:36:56.386 --> 01:36:57.587
Who cuts your hair?

01:36:58.488 --> 01:36:59.456
Tony.

01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:02.191
Tony?

01:37:04.594 --> 01:37:06.596
Yeah. Why, you think I
should go to your barber?

01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:08.831
No, but...

01:37:09.532 --> 01:37:10.833
Tony was my dad's barber.

01:37:11.768 --> 01:37:12.969
He's 94.

01:37:14.404 --> 01:37:16.539
Maybe his hand's
not as steady as it...

01:37:19.676 --> 01:37:21.244
As it used to be.

01:37:24.381 --> 01:37:26.215
It's just that it's all...

01:37:34.056 --> 01:37:35.425
So what's irrelevant?

01:37:37.460 --> 01:37:38.580
I want you to come to Paris.

01:37:41.964 --> 01:37:43.566
You mean go to Paris.

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.635
No. I want you
to come to Paris...

01:37:46.436 --> 01:37:47.304
With me.

01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.909
You're...
You're really going?

01:37:52.942 --> 01:37:55.612
It's your fault.

01:37:55.645 --> 01:37:58.681
You convinced me that things
were missing in my life.

01:37:58.715 --> 01:37:59.949
Like what?

01:38:01.384 --> 01:38:03.420
(WHISPERING) Like a life.

01:38:03.453 --> 01:38:04.621
I didn't think
you were listening.

01:38:04.654 --> 01:38:05.655
I was.

01:38:07.857 --> 01:38:09.892
Will you come?
Don't say no.

01:38:11.328 --> 01:38:12.362
Will you?

01:38:14.664 --> 01:38:15.965
I just got back.
So?

01:38:16.833 --> 01:38:18.267
Say yes now.

01:38:21.037 --> 01:38:22.038
We leave tomorrow.

01:38:22.872 --> 01:38:24.841
(STUTTERING) Tomorrow?

01:38:24.874 --> 01:38:26.376
I have to talk to David.

01:38:26.409 --> 01:38:27.043
Just come away.

01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:33.049
He'll get the idea
in a week or two.

01:38:35.852 --> 01:38:37.687
You are formidable, aren't you?

01:38:39.021 --> 01:38:40.056
In business dealings.

01:38:40.089 --> 01:38:41.691
This isn't business.

01:38:44.126 --> 01:38:45.886
Didn't you once say
"Everything is business"?

01:38:47.397 --> 01:38:48.331
No.

01:38:48.898 --> 01:38:49.778
But it sounds like me.

01:38:55.037 --> 01:38:55.972
What will you tell him?

01:39:18.928 --> 01:39:19.996
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:39:23.466 --> 01:39:24.601
I did knock.

01:39:26.102 --> 01:39:27.670
Here are the tickets.

01:39:30.072 --> 01:39:32.609
And the other things
are being taken care of.

01:39:35.878 --> 01:39:37.514
And... Good night.

01:39:43.553 --> 01:39:44.421
So it is.

01:39:51.561 --> 01:39:52.762
You want dinner?

01:39:54.797 --> 01:39:55.765
No.

01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:59.001
I could order in.

01:40:00.837 --> 01:40:01.738
No.

01:40:02.672 --> 01:40:03.773
Oh, Linus.

01:40:08.711 --> 01:40:11.147
I... I don't understand
what happened.

01:40:13.516 --> 01:40:15.552
I hardly know you.
Oh, yes, you do.

01:40:16.118 --> 01:40:18.488
I wasn't even interested.

01:40:18.521 --> 01:40:20.423
Gee, thanks.
No! (LAUGHING)

01:40:22.158 --> 01:40:24.527
I was interested in David.

01:40:24.561 --> 01:40:26.663
He was so much what I wanted

01:40:26.696 --> 01:40:28.965
that I had to escape,
and I did, to Paris,

01:40:28.998 --> 01:40:31.200
and I wrote in my stupid journal

01:40:31.233 --> 01:40:33.870
and I cut my stupid hair

01:40:33.903 --> 01:40:36.439
and I came back
stupider than ever.

01:40:37.106 --> 01:40:38.608
Oh, Linus!

01:40:40.610 --> 01:40:41.944
I'm so happy.

01:40:41.978 --> 01:40:45.147
You... You've made me
so happy.

01:40:51.888 --> 01:40:52.855
Linus?

01:41:05.167 --> 01:41:06.769
I can't do this.

01:41:07.837 --> 01:41:08.838
What is it?

01:41:10.039 --> 01:41:10.840
You were right.

01:41:11.674 --> 01:41:12.542
About what?

01:41:13.776 --> 01:41:15.144
About everything.

01:41:16.178 --> 01:41:17.880
Everything that mattered.

01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:22.619
It was all a lie,

01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:25.522
everything I said to you

01:41:25.555 --> 01:41:27.836
from the moment I brought the
champagne into the solarium.

01:41:31.027 --> 01:41:32.194
I don't believe you.

01:41:33.996 --> 01:41:35.732
I was sent to deal with you.

01:41:36.833 --> 01:41:38.134
I sent myself.

01:41:39.802 --> 01:41:41.203
And I did a hell of a job.

01:41:45.742 --> 01:41:47.209
There was a marriage.

01:41:47.243 --> 01:41:48.878
There was a merger.

01:41:50.112 --> 01:41:51.480
You got in the way.

01:41:54.684 --> 01:41:56.786
The plan was
to take you to Paris,

01:41:57.654 --> 01:41:58.755
then leave,

01:41:59.255 --> 01:42:01.223
to get you out of the way.

01:42:35.057 --> 01:42:36.258
Sabrina, I think there's...

01:42:36.292 --> 01:42:38.292
SABRINA: What other things
are being taken care of?

01:42:39.228 --> 01:42:40.262
What?

01:42:41.363 --> 01:42:43.199
She said,
"other things."

01:42:46.769 --> 01:42:48.771
An apartment for you in Paris,

01:42:49.171 --> 01:42:50.807
and a bank account.

01:42:51.974 --> 01:42:52.975
How much?

01:42:55.211 --> 01:42:56.746
500,000 francs.

01:43:00.216 --> 01:43:01.951
Your first offer was better.

01:43:04.987 --> 01:43:06.589
You can have more.

01:43:09.926 --> 01:43:11.560
I don't want more.

01:43:14.263 --> 01:43:15.832
I don't want any.

01:43:20.870 --> 01:43:23.205
You went to all that
trouble just for me?

01:43:24.774 --> 01:43:26.054
The helicopter
and the jet and...

01:43:27.043 --> 01:43:27.844
It was no trouble.

01:43:29.712 --> 01:43:31.914
Was I really so bad for David?
So wrong?

01:43:33.683 --> 01:43:34.817
The chauffeur's daughter.
Isn't that all over?

01:43:35.217 --> 01:43:36.786
That's not it.

01:43:40.122 --> 01:43:41.590
It's about a piece of plastic.

01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:42.992
Plastic?

01:43:43.893 --> 01:43:45.261
Nothing personal.

01:43:54.070 --> 01:43:55.004
May I?

01:44:05.314 --> 01:44:07.049
Paris is always a good idea.

01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:09.318
I was happy there.

01:44:11.387 --> 01:44:12.889
You would've been, too.

01:44:29.371 --> 01:44:30.306
I'll drive you home.

01:44:33.342 --> 01:44:34.877
I'm flying home.

01:45:47.383 --> 01:45:49.451
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)
(CAR DRIVING AWAY)

01:46:10.072 --> 01:46:12.074
He shall have music
wherever he goes.

01:46:14.911 --> 01:46:15.812
Hi.

01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:18.815
You're better.

01:46:19.281 --> 01:46:20.516
Oh, yeah.

01:46:21.317 --> 01:46:22.819
Much better.

01:46:24.821 --> 01:46:26.755
Stitches come out tomorrow.

01:46:32.328 --> 01:46:33.896
How about you?

01:46:35.231 --> 01:46:36.111
Where you coming from?

01:46:36.899 --> 01:46:37.766
Town.

01:46:40.970 --> 01:46:42.138
Long evening.

01:46:43.605 --> 01:46:44.885
I thought we were going to talk.

01:46:49.846 --> 01:46:52.514
I was planning a big stitch
removal celebration.

01:46:53.182 --> 01:46:53.983
I thought we'd...

01:46:54.516 --> 01:46:55.985
I was with Linus.

01:47:06.963 --> 01:47:09.165
You know, of all the
girls I've known...

01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:12.468
...and I've
known some...

01:47:14.136 --> 01:47:14.971
Is that a song?

01:47:18.007 --> 01:47:19.976
You're the only girl
I danced with only once.

01:47:21.110 --> 01:47:21.978
Twice.

01:47:24.013 --> 01:47:24.881
What?

01:47:26.048 --> 01:47:27.128
How could I have forgotten?

01:47:28.650 --> 01:47:29.585
Was there champagne?

01:47:31.353 --> 01:47:32.821
I was eight,

01:47:33.655 --> 01:47:35.557
and you were taking
dancing lessons,

01:47:35.591 --> 01:47:37.159
and I was homework.

01:47:42.664 --> 01:47:44.200
I'm leaving town, David.

01:47:49.038 --> 01:47:50.039
I think I knew that.

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:52.841
I won a ticket to Paris.

01:47:55.477 --> 01:47:56.845
Lucky.

01:47:57.546 --> 01:47:58.547
One way?

01:48:00.316 --> 01:48:02.084
Yes, come to think of it.

01:48:06.288 --> 01:48:07.589
Traveling alone?

01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:12.528
Yes.

01:48:20.702 --> 01:48:22.138
You have a good trip.

01:48:43.492 --> 01:48:44.526
You're here.

01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:46.462
So are you.

01:48:46.495 --> 01:48:48.064
I want you to call
Seattle and Tokyo.

01:48:48.097 --> 01:48:50.199
Tell them to stop construction.

01:48:50.232 --> 01:48:52.935
Then get the Rons and Tysons
and tell them

01:48:52.969 --> 01:48:55.337
there's an emergency meeting
on the merger here at noon,

01:48:57.239 --> 01:48:59.075
and take this Paris ticket
that was in my name

01:48:59.108 --> 01:49:00.909
and transfer it to the
name of David Larrabee.

01:49:02.011 --> 01:49:03.145
I need to see my mother...

01:49:03.179 --> 01:49:04.313
DAVID: Linus!

01:49:06.315 --> 01:49:08.155
I need to see my mother
as soon as she gets in.

01:49:12.221 --> 01:49:15.057
Good morning, David.
Can I get you some coffee?

01:49:16.392 --> 01:49:18.194
No? Okay.

01:49:19.361 --> 01:49:21.130
I got a surprise for you.

01:49:21.763 --> 01:49:22.698
Yeah?

01:49:23.399 --> 01:49:24.700
I got one for you, too.

01:49:29.005 --> 01:49:30.706
I've watched you
do business for years.

01:49:30.739 --> 01:49:33.175
But I thought there was
a limit to how sick...

01:49:33.675 --> 01:49:36.212
How could you, Linus?

01:49:36.245 --> 01:49:39.115
How could you do what you
did to me and to her?

01:49:39.148 --> 01:49:41.017
How could you go that far?

01:49:42.184 --> 01:49:44.104
What the hell makes you
think you have the right?

01:49:46.222 --> 01:49:47.256
Habit.

01:49:50.426 --> 01:49:51.994
Listen, David,

01:49:53.562 --> 01:49:55.964
I tried something
and it didn't work.

01:49:57.333 --> 01:50:00.502
I mean it worked,
but it didn't really work.

01:50:00.536 --> 01:50:02.071
I want you
to go to Paris today...

01:50:05.441 --> 01:50:06.275
With Sabrina.

01:50:07.443 --> 01:50:08.344
What?

01:50:10.112 --> 01:50:11.632
This whole thing
was a business tactic,

01:50:12.514 --> 01:50:14.250
but it got out of hand.

01:50:15.484 --> 01:50:17.286
Somehow I lost my focus.

01:50:20.822 --> 01:50:22.691
I screwed up everything.

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:26.395
But I know it can be fixed.

01:50:27.763 --> 01:50:29.365
I manipulated her,

01:50:30.232 --> 01:50:31.400
I confused her.

01:50:33.769 --> 01:50:35.337
But she's loved you
all her life.

01:50:37.673 --> 01:50:39.441
You're what she really wants.

01:50:41.677 --> 01:50:43.712
You're what she's always wanted.

01:50:45.581 --> 01:50:47.416
Go with her.
It's not too late.

01:50:48.684 --> 01:50:49.785
Things will work out.

01:50:50.452 --> 01:50:52.154
She'll make you happy.

01:50:55.491 --> 01:50:57.726
I don't want her
to have to leave here alone.

01:50:59.361 --> 01:51:00.762
What about Patrick
and the merger?

01:51:16.178 --> 01:51:17.679
You'd blow a billion
dollars for this?

01:51:24.286 --> 01:51:25.187
I see.

01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:29.225
Get going.

01:51:30.659 --> 01:51:31.727
Go on.

01:51:34.130 --> 01:51:35.063
Don't miss the plane.

01:51:42.538 --> 01:51:45.441
Ms. McArdle, I want to see
you in my office right away.

01:51:46.508 --> 01:51:47.509
Where... Where is it?

01:51:49.145 --> 01:51:51.847
TOM: When your mother
and I first came here,

01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:55.117
she cooked, and I drove,
and we had no expenses.

01:51:55.151 --> 01:51:57.253
After a couple of years,
we had $15,000.

01:51:59.288 --> 01:52:02.758
I was driving Mr. Larrabee,
senior, at the time...

01:52:02.791 --> 01:52:04.431
And he never closed
the window between us.

01:52:06.195 --> 01:52:08.275
He transacted a lot of
business on the daily commute,

01:52:08.830 --> 01:52:11.400
and I paid attention.

01:52:11.433 --> 01:52:14.203
When he bought, I bought.
When he sold, I sold.

01:52:16.238 --> 01:52:18.340
Dad, are you telling me you
have a million dollars?

01:52:18.574 --> 01:52:19.508
No.

01:52:20.542 --> 01:52:22.110
A little over 2 million.

01:52:24.913 --> 01:52:26.815
Your mother and I
were happy here, Sabrina.

01:52:28.584 --> 01:52:31.024
We always dreamed of what it would
be like to do this for you.

01:52:32.921 --> 01:52:35.457
$2 million might have
exceeded our expectations,

01:52:37.693 --> 01:52:40.128
but then, you've always
exceeded mine.

01:52:47.636 --> 01:52:49.871
I know what his instructions
were, but it's a mistake.

01:52:49.905 --> 01:52:53.375
I'm giving you new instructions.
There's been a change. We...

01:52:55.611 --> 01:52:58.146
Just get started,
and I'll call you back.

01:53:02.818 --> 01:53:04.286
Thanks for getting here
so quickly.

01:53:07.823 --> 01:53:09.791
I need to tell you a story.

01:53:13.229 --> 01:53:15.163
And I need for you to tell me

01:53:17.366 --> 01:53:18.567
how it's going to turn out.

01:53:29.678 --> 01:53:32.814
All those years, you
made all that money,

01:53:33.915 --> 01:53:36.485
and you never told
any of us how to do it.

01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:40.989
I'll tell you now, Joanna.

01:53:41.022 --> 01:53:42.724
Marry me.
Marry me for my money.

01:53:42.758 --> 01:53:44.493
People do it every day.

01:53:45.694 --> 01:53:47.896
I'm not amused, Thomas,

01:53:47.929 --> 01:53:50.299
and I have
a great sense of humor.

01:53:54.503 --> 01:53:56.204
Then marry me for love.

(ELEVATOR BELL DINGING)

01:54:16.758 --> 01:54:18.627
Emergency what?
What's the emergency?

01:54:18.660 --> 01:54:20.596
Now, darling, if I knew...

01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:23.265
I'm sure there's a perfectly
good answer to that question.

01:54:23.299 --> 01:54:25.901
(WHISPERING) I've got my dress.
It looks fabulous.

01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:30.506
What the hell is going on?

01:54:30.539 --> 01:54:31.379
In a minute, Patrick.

01:54:32.308 --> 01:54:33.975
What are we waiting for?

01:54:34.009 --> 01:54:35.329
And what's with
Siegfried and Roy?

01:54:35.744 --> 01:54:36.664
Just a minute, Patrick.

01:54:43.452 --> 01:54:44.453
Okay.

01:54:46.788 --> 01:54:49.325
We've known each other
for a long time.

01:54:49.358 --> 01:54:51.393
We may have played hardball
on occasion,

01:54:51.427 --> 01:54:53.995
but I think we have
a healthy respect for our...

01:54:55.364 --> 01:54:57.799
...our individual
business abilities.

01:54:57.833 --> 01:54:59.768
We saw the potential
of this merger.

01:54:59.801 --> 01:55:01.470
I don't think anybody doubts

01:55:01.503 --> 01:55:04.640
it would have been an
enormously successful venture.

01:55:04.673 --> 01:55:06.274
"Would have been"?

01:55:08.444 --> 01:55:10.078
The purpose of this meeting
is to inform you

01:55:10.111 --> 01:55:11.711
that at this moment,
my brother, David...

01:55:11.713 --> 01:55:13.482
Is late,
as usual. Sorry.

01:55:14.983 --> 01:55:16.452
DAVID: Sorry, everybody.
What are you doing here?

01:55:16.485 --> 01:55:18.854
Elizabeth and I
have decided to elope.

01:55:18.887 --> 01:55:20.021
Really?

01:55:20.055 --> 01:55:21.490
David, where's Sabrina?

01:55:21.523 --> 01:55:22.358
So, are we merging?
Are we all one?

01:55:22.791 --> 01:55:23.959
Who's Sabrina?

01:55:23.992 --> 01:55:25.427
You didn't go with her?

01:55:25.461 --> 01:55:28.397
Obviously not, Linus.
Here I am, right?

01:55:28.430 --> 01:55:30.932
She's probably having her
beverage service right about now.

01:55:30.966 --> 01:55:32.734
Who is? Who's Sabrina? Sabrina.

01:55:33.635 --> 01:55:34.803
The chauffeur's daughter.

01:55:34.836 --> 01:55:37.339
Don't call her that. She was
after David for a while,

01:55:37.373 --> 01:55:39.741
then apparently
she switched to Linus.

01:55:39.775 --> 01:55:42.010
She seems to have decided he
was the one with the power.

01:55:42.043 --> 01:55:43.645
Is that what he told you?

01:55:43.679 --> 01:55:45.447
He told me everything, Linus.

01:55:45.481 --> 01:55:47.883
You didn't see her before she left?
You didn't talk to her?

01:55:47.916 --> 01:55:49.351
Oh, sure. I said goodbye,

01:55:49.385 --> 01:55:51.420
and I think I wished her luck.

01:55:51.787 --> 01:55:53.422
Maybe not.

01:55:53.455 --> 01:55:56.024
I said I felt kind of funny accepting
my brother's hand-me-downs.

01:55:56.057 --> 01:55:57.759
I said, don't take it
personally,

01:55:57.793 --> 01:55:59.895
and I told her you've
always been very generous

01:55:59.928 --> 01:56:01.497
to your women in the past,

01:56:01.530 --> 01:56:04.700
and I was sure she'd be more
than compensated for...

01:56:05.033 --> 01:56:06.034
Whatever.

01:56:06.935 --> 01:56:08.136
(ALL GASP)

01:56:08.169 --> 01:56:09.638
See! I told you.
He loves her.

01:56:09.671 --> 01:56:10.772
Who?
Sabrina.

01:56:10.806 --> 01:56:12.040
Is he packed?
Yes.

01:56:12.073 --> 01:56:13.141
Is who packed?

01:56:13.174 --> 01:56:14.910
You are. Just one bag.

01:56:14.943 --> 01:56:16.978
Wait a minute. You packed my clothes?
You went to my apartment?

01:56:17.012 --> 01:56:18.514
I took her.

01:56:18.547 --> 01:56:20.507
We were up to our elbows
in your underwear drawer.

01:56:20.516 --> 01:56:21.917
It was like touching
the Shroud of Turin.

01:56:21.950 --> 01:56:23.485
Here. Sign this.

01:56:23.519 --> 01:56:25.353
It's your authorization
for the merger.

01:56:25.687 --> 01:56:26.988
And this.

01:56:27.022 --> 01:56:29.625
It gives me the raise I deserve for
the new position I'm assuming.

01:56:29.658 --> 01:56:31.660
There's a car waiting
for you downstairs,

01:56:31.693 --> 01:56:33.562
a helicopter at East 60th.

01:56:33.595 --> 01:56:35.931
The plane ticket's
been changed to the Concorde.

01:56:35.964 --> 01:56:37.933
It leaves in exactly 39 minutes.

01:56:37.966 --> 01:56:39.766
If you make it, you just
might beat her there.

01:56:41.970 --> 01:56:43.439
Go, Linus.
Don't think.

01:56:46.107 --> 01:56:48.510
She... She must
absolutely hate me.

01:56:48.544 --> 01:56:50.078
She'll get over it.
We all do.

01:56:51.647 --> 01:56:52.681
This is crazy.

01:56:52.714 --> 01:56:55.183
You expect me
to just drop everything

01:56:55.216 --> 01:56:56.184
and walk out of here?

01:56:56.217 --> 01:56:57.586
Running is better.

01:56:57.619 --> 01:56:59.020
You're all nuts.

01:56:59.054 --> 01:57:01.089
MAUDE: Linus,
you know I love you.

01:57:01.122 --> 01:57:03.825
No mother could be prouder,

01:57:03.859 --> 01:57:07.395
but I think it's time that
you ran away from home.

01:57:09.465 --> 01:57:10.305
But sign these first.

01:57:36.091 --> 01:57:38.193
If you'll excuse me,

01:57:38.226 --> 01:57:40.028
it appears I have
a previous engagement.

01:57:44.933 --> 01:57:46.668
Now, Patrick,

01:57:46.702 --> 01:57:48.737
the debt burden
this merger will accumulate

01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:51.873
will make it essential to
restructure a couple of divisions

01:57:51.907 --> 01:57:53.742
that are generating cash drains.

01:57:53.775 --> 01:57:55.877
I've done a very quick review

01:57:55.911 --> 01:57:58.614
of last quarter's performance of
each division of both companies.

01:57:58.647 --> 01:57:59.848
David,

01:57:59.881 --> 01:58:01.750
when did you ever...

01:58:01.783 --> 01:58:03.985
Mother, you've copied me on the
financial statements of this company

01:58:04.019 --> 01:58:05.453
for 17 years.

01:58:06.154 --> 01:58:07.489
Just assumed I couldn't read.

01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:20.536
Go ahead, say it.

01:58:22.270 --> 01:58:24.172
You don't deserve her.

01:58:26.642 --> 01:58:27.643
I don't.

01:58:28.844 --> 01:58:30.111
I know that.

01:58:31.913 --> 01:58:33.515
But I need her,

01:58:34.249 --> 01:58:35.817
and I don't need anything.

01:58:43.024 --> 01:58:44.693
(HORN HONKING)

01:58:46.762 --> 01:58:47.796
Time to run for it.

01:58:53.669 --> 01:58:54.870
I just want to make her happy.

01:58:58.974 --> 01:59:00.609
13 rue des Beaux Arts.

01:59:28.236 --> 01:59:30.071
ANNOUNCER:
Your attention, please.

01:59:30.105 --> 01:59:34.042
Last call for Air France Concorde
supersonic flight to Paris.

01:59:34.075 --> 01:59:36.612
Now boarding at gate 34.

01:59:36.645 --> 01:59:38.880
Air France wishes you
a pleasant flight.

01:59:40.882 --> 01:59:42.618
First time on the Concorde, Mr.
Larrabee?

01:59:42.984 --> 01:59:43.919
Yes.

01:59:44.986 --> 01:59:46.287
But not your first
time in Paris?

01:59:47.656 --> 01:59:48.890
It's my first everything.

02:00:23.058 --> 02:00:24.125
Bonsoir.

02:00:24.159 --> 02:00:25.260
Bonsoir.

02:00:45.446 --> 02:00:47.849
Paris is always
a good idea, you said.

02:00:53.188 --> 02:00:55.657
You said I'd be happy here.

02:00:55.691 --> 02:00:57.859
You couldn't have meant
without you.

02:01:04.332 --> 02:01:05.652
How did you know
where to find me?

02:01:06.902 --> 02:01:07.803
Your father.

02:01:10.105 --> 02:01:11.840
I told him I need you.

02:01:17.145 --> 02:01:18.947
I told him I'd make you happy.

02:01:20.381 --> 02:01:21.850
I promised him.

02:01:27.022 --> 02:01:28.790
I thought it was all a lie.

02:01:33.962 --> 02:01:34.996
So did I...

02:01:37.999 --> 02:01:39.701
But something happened.

02:01:40.936 --> 02:01:42.070
It was a lie...

02:01:46.274 --> 02:01:47.909
And then it was a dream.

02:01:51.947 --> 02:01:53.982
I don't know how to believe you.

02:01:55.984 --> 02:01:56.985
How can I ever...

02:01:57.018 --> 02:01:58.119
Because you know me...

02:01:59.087 --> 02:02:00.822
Better than anyone else.

02:02:07.195 --> 02:02:09.030
I think you know I love you...

02:02:15.136 --> 02:02:16.805
And you promised...

02:02:18.339 --> 02:02:19.374
If there was anything

02:02:19.407 --> 02:02:20.942
you could ever do...

02:02:22.778 --> 02:02:24.712
SABRINA: Once upon a time,

02:02:25.914 --> 02:02:27.916
on the north shore
of Long Island,

02:02:28.549 --> 02:02:30.385
not far from New York,

02:02:31.452 --> 02:02:33.755
there was a very,
very large mansion.

02:02:34.289 --> 02:02:36.491
Almost a castle.

02:02:36.524 --> 02:02:38.760
I've been following in
footsteps all my life.

02:02:41.329 --> 02:02:43.131
Save me, Sabrina fair.

02:02:45.500 --> 02:02:47.402
You're the only one who can.

02:02:51.572 --> 02:02:53.274
SABRINA: And on this
very large estate,

02:02:53.308 --> 02:02:55.777
there lived a small girl,

02:02:55.811 --> 02:02:58.046
and life was pleasant there,

02:02:58.079 --> 02:02:59.881
and very, very simple...

02:03:01.482 --> 02:03:04.820
But then one day
the girl grew up

02:03:07.155 --> 02:03:08.890
and went beyond
the walls of the grounds

02:03:11.159 --> 02:03:12.794
and found the world.

02:03:47.495 --> 02:03:50.265
* In the moonlight

02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:54.903
* When the shadows play

02:03:56.271 --> 02:03:59.807
* When the thought
of what could happen

02:04:00.341 --> 02:04:03.211
* Takes your breath away

02:04:04.379 --> 02:04:07.916
* Sighs and whispers

02:04:09.017 --> 02:04:12.587
* Quiet laughter in the air

02:04:13.554 --> 02:04:20.095
* Unspoken invitations
everywhere

02:04:21.897 --> 02:04:25.233
* In the moonlight

02:04:26.267 --> 02:04:28.970
* All the words you say

02:04:30.405 --> 02:04:33.975
* Make it relatively easy

02:04:34.542 --> 02:04:37.946
* To be swept away

02:04:38.914 --> 02:04:42.483
* In the half-light

02:04:43.318 --> 02:04:46.922
* Can we trust the way we feel?

02:04:48.056 --> 02:04:53.228
* Can we be sure
That anything is real?

02:04:55.696 --> 02:05:02.203
* Stars keep secrets
As they wonder discreetly

02:05:04.672 --> 02:05:10.878
* While the echoes
Of a song go drifting by

02:05:12.547 --> 02:05:19.154
* We must be careful Not
to lose our way completely

02:05:21.722 --> 02:05:25.560
* Or the magic That we seek here

02:05:26.527 --> 02:05:30.331
* We can't be sure Will be here

02:05:30.365 --> 02:05:33.634
* In the morning

02:05:34.635 --> 02:05:38.006
* With the moon away

02:05:39.007 --> 02:05:42.310
* And if in each other's arms

02:05:43.344 --> 02:05:46.314
* Is where we're meant to stay

02:05:47.482 --> 02:05:52.120
* In the love light

02:05:52.153 --> 02:05:58.593
* When our eyes have grown
Accustomed to the daylight

02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:05.366
* We'll see what waits
For us to share

02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:11.572
* For all the things We've
dreamed of in the moonlight

02:06:11.606 --> 02:06:18.579
* Will be

02:06:22.317 --> 02:06:26.621
* There

02:06:30.391 --> 02:06:32.593
* In the moonlight

02:06:39.167 --> 02:06:45.973
* The moonlight

02:06:50.578 --> 02:06:55.150
* The moonlight *
