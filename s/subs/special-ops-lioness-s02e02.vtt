20:41.414 --> 20:43.938

is the oldest.

20:44.112 --> 20:45.679

20:45.809 --> 20:49.248
is roughly south of Arizona
and Western New Mexico

20:49.422 --> 20:51.380
through the Sierra Madres
to the coast.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.556
Has disputed control
of Baja California

20:53.687 --> 20:55.297
with the Tijuana cartel

20:55.428 --> 20:59.214
who controls everything
north of La Paz to the border.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.782
The Chihuahua
and Coahuila cartel,

21:01.912 --> 21:03.914
also known as "Los Tigres,"

21:04.045 --> 21:06.961
control the border
of Eastern New Mexico

21:07.048 --> 21:09.920
and all the border of Texas
to Nuevo Laredo,

21:10.007 --> 21:13.272
which is disputed territory
with the Nuevo Leon cartel,

21:13.446 --> 21:16.623
who controls everything else
to the Gulf of Mexico and south.

of commerce.

21:24.544 --> 21:26.589
Main sources of revenue--
synthetics,

21:26.720 --> 21:28.504
methamphetamines, fentanyl,

21:28.635 --> 21:30.724
human trafficking
and kidnapping and extortion,

21:30.811 --> 21:34.075
mainly of avocado
and lime farmers,

21:34.205 --> 21:36.382
and, um, oil tapping.

21:36.469 --> 21:39.515
- What's that?
- Black market oil sold

21:39.646 --> 21:43.214
to North Korea, Cuba,
and of course, China,

21:43.302 --> 21:47.784
who is Mexico's largest exporter
of open-market oil.

21:48.829 --> 21:51.614

to oil pipelines, their control

21:51.701 --> 21:54.095
of the most accessible
border crossing points,

21:54.269 --> 21:57.446

Currently serving

on a train-and-advise mission

27:11.760 --> 27:12.935
Great.

[Hollar]
Tell us more about the captain.

27:14.241 --> 27:15.546
West Point graduate.

27:15.677 --> 27:17.244
Four tours of duty
in Afghanistan.

27:17.418 --> 27:18.898
Multiple decorations.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.769
Yeah, well,
this-this can't be right.

27:20.900 --> 27:22.249
How many kills does she have?

27:22.379 --> 27:23.554
Eight twenty-two.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.034
[Mullins]
What?

27:25.165 --> 27:26.775
Eight hundred
and twenty-two kills?

27:26.949 --> 27:29.865
She was involved in a number
of convoy attacks

27:30.039 --> 27:32.302
in the Peshawar province
and along the border of Iran.

27:32.433 --> 27:34.827
Some of those convoys,
they numbered in the hundreds.

27:34.957 --> 27:38.657
What he means to say is, kills
add up quickly in an Apache.

27:38.787 --> 27:39.962
She's only reached the rank
of captain?

27:40.093 --> 27:41.660
Mm-hmm.

27:41.834 --> 27:44.010
After ten years
and all these commendations?

27:44.184 --> 27:45.228
What's the catch?

27:45.402 --> 27:46.316
[Kaitlyn]
Anything north of major

27:46.447 --> 27:48.405
sits behind a desk, ma'am.

27:48.536 --> 27:50.712
She seems to like action.

27:50.886 --> 27:54.542
So your plan is to run her
through your program,

27:54.673 --> 27:57.240
get her to the uncle, and then?

27:57.371 --> 27:59.939
Our plan is
to fabricate a court-martial,

28:00.026 --> 28:02.855
have her discharged
on some level of disgrace

28:02.942 --> 28:05.640
that will withstand scrutiny
of anyone investigating.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.425
We can't invent a cover
in this instance.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.210
We need it to be legitimate.

28:10.297 --> 28:12.212
Well, how will
her military career recover?

28:12.386 --> 28:14.083
- It doesn't.
- No.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.564
- It doesn't?
- [Westfield] If she accepts,

28:16.695 --> 28:17.826
and the mission is successful,

28:17.957 --> 28:19.175
she will likely end up
in WitPro.

28:19.262 --> 28:21.177
Or if she wishes
to continue her service,

28:21.308 --> 28:23.310
we find a place for her
in the 160th.

28:23.440 --> 28:24.528
Or she can fly for us.

28:24.659 --> 28:26.879
I haven't heard a plan.

28:27.009 --> 28:30.012
Well, we assume that her father
is in contact with Carrillo,

28:30.143 --> 28:32.449
and the plan is,
simply send her home.

28:32.623 --> 28:34.277
I mean, she's a pilot,

28:34.408 --> 28:35.931
and that's an extremely
coveted skill in the cartels,

28:36.062 --> 28:37.454
and we think
it's gonna happen organically.

28:37.585 --> 28:40.196
All right, they contact her.
Then what?

28:40.327 --> 28:41.763
[Kaitlyn]
It's very likely that

28:41.937 --> 28:44.331
they will use her
to drop loads in South Texas,

28:44.461 --> 28:46.289
quite possibly human cargo,
as well.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.639
- When you say human cargo?
- [Westfield] Farm workers.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.903
They're often flown in

28:51.033 --> 28:53.079
and dropped into the fields
of Central California,

28:53.209 --> 28:54.776
Pecos regions of Texas,

28:54.907 --> 28:56.473
and then they're driven south
to work.

28:56.647 --> 28:58.127
Border Patrol check stations,

28:58.258 --> 28:59.868
they only stop
northbound traffic.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.609
[Mason] Well,
how does this get us closer

29:01.740 --> 29:04.655
to MSS agents working
with cartels?

29:04.786 --> 29:05.961
[Kaitlyn]
She's close family.

29:06.092 --> 29:09.095
That grants her access
nobody else can obtain.

29:09.225 --> 29:11.184
MSS will have direct contact
with Carrillo

29:11.314 --> 29:12.707
as well as his lieutenants.

29:12.794 --> 29:14.361
- She's a pilot, right?
- [Kaitlyn] Mm-hmm.

29:14.535 --> 29:15.928
She's not a Lioness.

29:16.058 --> 29:18.234
She's not trained
to neutralize targets,

29:18.365 --> 29:21.063
and you don't have time
to teach her.

29:21.194 --> 29:23.370
She's not a combat operator,
that's correct.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.893
But she doesn't need to be

29:25.024 --> 29:27.374
because she can fly
the operators to them.

29:27.504 --> 29:29.376
[Westfield]
Think of her as a Trojan horse.

29:29.550 --> 29:30.725
Once we have MSS
on our location,

29:30.856 --> 29:32.335
she can insert a team,

29:32.466 --> 29:34.163
and then we will have
a capture-kill option,

29:34.294 --> 29:36.339
depending on the message
that POTUS wants to send.

29:37.210 --> 29:39.560
All right.

29:39.690 --> 29:41.780
Now walk me through the risks.

29:41.910 --> 29:44.783
Uh, the risks
that come with aviation.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.220
There is the dangers
of competing cartels,

29:47.394 --> 29:49.962
there's the risks of exposure
of any clandestine operation,

29:50.136 --> 29:53.748
and the risks of DEA
or HS intervention.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.924
Ah.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.579
Let's suppose

29:58.709 --> 30:01.495
that DEA stumbles on this.

30:01.582 --> 30:03.149
What's the contain?

30:04.280 --> 30:05.847
There is none.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.588
It would be far better
to have mission failure

30:07.718 --> 30:09.416
on the Mexican side
than on the U.S. side.

30:09.590 --> 30:11.331
[Hollar]
Why is that?

30:11.418 --> 30:13.899
Because the cartel
would just kill her.

30:14.029 --> 30:17.206
Here, U.S. law enforcement
would have a prosecutable case

30:17.337 --> 30:19.426
against officers of the CIA,

30:19.556 --> 30:21.558
and the Chinese would discover
an act of war

30:21.645 --> 30:23.952
by the United States
on CBS News.

30:25.127 --> 30:27.521
[Hollar] So, back
to the original question.

30:27.608 --> 30:29.828
What if DEA or HS intervenes?

30:29.958 --> 30:31.873
What if they find you
unloading 1,000 pounds

30:32.004 --> 30:33.222
of fentanyl in the desert?

30:33.353 --> 30:35.834
They would evade if possible.

30:35.964 --> 30:38.010
And if not,
the unit would resist

30:38.097 --> 30:41.665
until contact is broken
and an escape executed.

30:41.796 --> 30:44.146
[Mason]
By "resist,"

30:44.233 --> 30:46.757
do you mean
that they will fire upon them?

30:46.932 --> 30:48.759
If fired upon,

30:48.890 --> 30:51.762
yes, that is correct.

30:51.850 --> 30:55.418
Look, the alternative
is sending a Ranger battalion

30:55.549 --> 30:59.335
to Juárez with three Delta
Squadrons and SEAL Team 6,

30:59.422 --> 31:02.817
while predators make
strafing runs along the border.

31:04.427 --> 31:06.386
Do you want a war
or do you want a prize?

31:06.516 --> 31:08.475
Both have extreme risks.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.783
