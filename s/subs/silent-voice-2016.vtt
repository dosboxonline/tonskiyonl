Director: Naoko Yamada

03:57.626 --> 03:59.250
Hey, everyone sit down!

04:01.000 --> 04:04.417
We have a new student today.

04:09.167 --> 04:10.584
What is it?

04:10.709 --> 04:13.459
You're lucky! It's a girl.

04:15.209 --> 04:17.083
I'm not interested at all.

04:30.816 --> 04:31.816
Well then,

04:31.959 --> 04:34.918
please introduce yourself.

04:44.250 --> 04:45.584
Huh?

04:46.000 --> 04:47.000
Oh...

04:57.876 --> 04:59.667
"For written communication"

05:01.375 --> 05:04.125
"Nice to meet you. I am Shoko Nishimiya."

05:08.083 --> 05:11.501
"I want to be friends with
you all through this notebook."

05:14.834 --> 05:19.083
"Please use this notebook
when you need to talk to me."

05:26.375 --> 05:29.708
"I can't hear."

05:29.709 --> 05:32.584
Unbelievable...

05:40.459 --> 05:41.959
Weird!

05:42.584 --> 05:43.875
"Hi, Nishimiya-san. I am Miki Kawai."

05:43.876 --> 05:45.751
Hi, nice to meet you.

05:46.083 --> 05:50.209
Hey, Nishimiya-san, can you speak Japanese?

05:50.375 --> 05:53.000
Nao-chan, be a little nicer...

05:53.250 --> 05:54.417
"Once again please."

05:54.542 --> 05:56.792
Ah ha...

05:57.459 --> 05:58.667
Huh?

05:58.792 --> 05:59.792
OK.

06:00.250 --> 06:04.918
What did your friends call you?

06:05.042 --> 06:07.167
I give up, I give up!

06:07.292 --> 06:09.209
I see, "Sho-chan".

06:09.334 --> 06:09.876
Huh?

06:10.292 --> 06:12.083
That's same as Ishida.

06:12.167 --> 06:13.792
She is called Sho-chan, too.

06:13.918 --> 06:15.083
That's so funny.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.167
What? That's not funny at all!

06:21.501 --> 06:24.876
Please write down what I'm saying.

06:25.250 --> 06:30.250
From pages 20 to page 25, and drills on page 32.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.250
That's what will be covered in the next test.

06:32.751 --> 06:33.751
Hey.

06:35.501 --> 06:37.250
Give me your notebook.

06:38.375 --> 06:42.459
First, "fulcrum". The point
that supports the strength.

06:42.626 --> 06:46.000
Next, "the effort point",
the point from which strength is taken.

06:46.125 --> 06:49.626
The point that supports the weight
is the point of loading.

06:49.792 --> 06:52.626
With these three points,

07:13.918 --> 07:15.751
Nishimiya-san,

07:15.876 --> 07:18.417
You are starting too fast.

07:18.918 --> 07:20.125
I will

07:20.292 --> 07:22.167
teach you the timing, OK?

07:25.167 --> 07:27.209
Then, let's start again from the beginning.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.959
How will we do in the
upcoming chorus competition?

07:33.375 --> 07:35.501
We just lost, didn't we?

07:36.209 --> 07:37.959
That's the penalty for saying weird things!

07:38.083 --> 07:40.542
Ouch, ouch!

07:40.834 --> 07:41.626
Ouch!

07:41.751 --> 07:43.125
So today

07:43.709 --> 07:46.584
I missed what the teacher
said again because of her...

07:46.709 --> 07:48.375
I'll lend you my notebook.

07:48.751 --> 07:50.417
Thank you.

07:52.751 --> 07:54.542
I am not wrong.

07:54.709 --> 07:56.792
That's why I will never say sorry.

07:56.918 --> 07:59.250
What a poor reading, Ueno.

07:59.375 --> 08:00.417
Oh...

08:00.959 --> 08:03.000
Crap. That's enough. Next!

08:03.375 --> 08:04.667
What the hell, ugly glasses.

08:04.876 --> 08:06.125
Nishimiya.

08:09.083 --> 08:10.876
From this sentence.

08:11.417 --> 08:17.167
Ztop do be zdabborn aboud zach zings.

08:17.751 --> 08:22.584
Mom zayz dizgazdingly,

08:24.876 --> 08:27.375
OK. Good. Next, Ishida.

08:28.209 --> 08:29.709
Really? Unbelievable.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.833
Hey, Ishida! Stop that!

08:48.292 --> 08:49.447
Ha ha ha...

08:49.538 --> 08:51.530
Please let me know what you are talking about.

09:16.626 --> 09:17.876
Let's go home.

09:18.375 --> 09:20.542
Bye-bye, Nishimiya-san.

09:54.709 --> 09:55.709
Hey you,

09:56.542 --> 10:01.000
At this rate, aren't you going to
drag down your classmates?

10:03.876 --> 10:04.876
What?

10:09.417 --> 10:11.167
Frie-nds...

10:14.250 --> 10:15.626
What?

10:16.792 --> 10:18.626
Disgusting!

10:28.475 --> 10:30.475
I'm Kita, I'm in a special education class.

10:30.501 --> 10:33.167
Today I wanna talk about "Shuwa" or sign language.

10:33.334 --> 10:35.876
Write as "speaking with hands"
and pronounce "Shu-wa".

10:36.584 --> 10:40.501
As the word says, Shuwa means
speaking by using your hands.

10:40.626 --> 10:42.209
Isn't it amazing?

10:42.667 --> 10:44.167
Sign... language...

10:44.334 --> 10:47.459
So I am proposing a three-minute lesson
of sign language everyday morning,

10:47.751 --> 10:51.834
to understand Shoko-chan even more.

10:55.292 --> 10:56.292
Teacher.

10:56.375 --> 10:57.501
Yes?

10:57.626 --> 10:59.959
Isn't it enough to use her notebook?

11:01.042 --> 11:05.417
It's easier for Shoko-chan using sign language.

11:06.792 --> 11:10.709
It's easier for me using the notebook.

11:12.751 --> 11:16.959
I'll learn sign language.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.417
"Teach me sign language for Sahara Miyoko"

11:23.083 --> 11:25.209
Sa - ara

11:25.918 --> 11:28.751
I - jo - ko

11:28.918 --> 11:30.334
Got it!

11:30.459 --> 11:31.542
Sa - a...

11:31.667 --> 11:33.417
Good job getting brownie points.

11:35.042 --> 11:37.209
I love him so much. He is so handsome.

11:37.334 --> 11:38.334
I agree!

11:38.375 --> 11:41.834
He will be in the drama next
week. You must see it!

11:42.417 --> 11:44.209
Don't you think her clothes are ugly?

11:44.584 --> 11:46.751
Stop that, Nao-chan.

11:48.083 --> 11:49.876
The author described through this work...

11:50.000 --> 11:52.167
After the experiment,
manganese dioxide should be...

11:59.167 --> 12:01.292
Hirose, you write on that side.

12:02.125 --> 12:03.918
Ni-shi-mi-ya.

12:04.334 --> 12:06.250
What are you doing, Ishida?

12:06.375 --> 12:07.876
You better stop that!

12:08.334 --> 12:09.584
Star.

12:09.709 --> 12:11.792
Ishida, you are going too far.

12:12.042 --> 12:14.417
No, no, that's how it should be.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.167
You're a terrible guy.

12:17.292 --> 12:19.459
Nice, nice.

12:19.751 --> 12:21.459
It's really nice.

12:21.667 --> 12:24.147
<i>"Congrats, Nishiyama-san.
Sahara-san went away because of you!"</i>

12:31.326 --> 12:34.367
That's so bad! Who wrote such nasty things!

12:35.042 --> 12:36.375
Too bad!

12:37.709 --> 12:40.292
I... will... kindly...

12:40.417 --> 12:42.417
erase it for you...

12:42.709 --> 12:43.709
OK.

12:44.375 --> 12:45.918
All erased.

12:59.257 --> 13:01.744
<i>"Thank you."</i>

13:04.584 --> 13:06.876
You are welcome.

13:07.334 --> 13:08.501
Let's go.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.167
Joumon-era was...

13:19.459 --> 13:20.876
Hey, Ishida.

13:21.417 --> 13:23.125
Class is not over.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.667
I see. I'm sorry.

13:26.584 --> 13:29.334
Well... I forgot what I was talking about...

13:29.459 --> 13:32.834
Well, what kind of house
were they living? They lived...

13:32.959 --> 13:35.709
Are you so surprised?

13:36.709 --> 13:39.375
Hey, Nishimiya-san.

13:41.959 --> 13:45.209
Does this mean you can actually hear?

13:45.334 --> 13:48.459
Yeah, I was thinking the same thing, too.

13:48.584 --> 13:50.000
Can I see it for a second?

13:52.667 --> 13:54.292
Ueno!

13:54.417 --> 13:56.501
What is that? Gimme.

14:00.542 --> 14:02.667
Oh, what is this?

14:02.792 --> 14:04.751
It's filthy!

14:20.542 --> 14:21.959
Ouch!

14:24.709 --> 14:25.459
Wh--What?

14:25.584 --> 14:26.209
Oh my god,

14:26.375 --> 14:28.292
Nishimiya-san, are you OK?

14:28.792 --> 14:30.876
What should I do....?

14:31.751 --> 14:33.542
Nishimiya-san.

14:33.667 --> 14:35.626
Hey, you went too far.

14:37.934 --> 14:40.068
Crap, ugly glasses is so annoying.

14:43.334 --> 14:45.042
What? Go away.

14:45.459 --> 14:46.709
Don't interrupt.

14:48.167 --> 14:50.042
What is she doing?

14:50.167 --> 14:51.458
Let's go home.

14:51.459 --> 14:54.411
<i>"I'm sorry."</i>

14:55.542 --> 14:56.667
You liar!

14:56.792 --> 14:58.751
If you want to say something to me, say it!

15:01.501 --> 15:02.292
What!?

15:02.501 --> 15:04.375
Stop it, you are disgusting!

15:04.751 --> 15:07.792
Oh, Nishimiya-san is funny!

15:07.918 --> 15:09.626
Shoya, you are blushing, aren't you?

15:09.751 --> 15:11.250
No, I'm not!

15:25.000 --> 15:26.250
Let's go.

15:30.501 --> 15:32.083
Huh?

15:32.375 --> 15:34.751
Oh, is she serious, Nishimiya-san?

15:34.918 --> 15:36.292
It's unbelievable!

15:45.459 --> 15:48.250
See you tomorrow, Shoya.

16:01.626 --> 16:06.334
Well, today I have a topic I
want to talk about to you all.

16:06.501 --> 16:11.000
It's about Nishimiya-san,
who is absent today.

16:11.125 --> 16:15.709
Yesterday we had a call from
Nishimiya-san's mother.

16:16.209 --> 16:21.459
She said eight of Nishimiya-san's
hearing aids have gone missing

16:21.584 --> 16:23.709
or been damaged in the past five months.

16:24.417 --> 16:28.501
Nishimiya-san's mother is worried
that she is being bullied at school.

16:30.209 --> 16:33.667
If any of you know anything about any bullying

16:33.792 --> 16:38.000
or similar harassment addressed to
Nishimiya-san, please let us know.

16:38.125 --> 16:43.667
We hear her hearing aids are very expensive.

16:49.292 --> 16:53.667
So please confess, before your
parents get involved.

16:53.751 --> 16:54.751
Hey, Ishida!

16:56.792 --> 16:59.792
We all know it was you.

17:00.209 --> 17:01.501
Stand up right now!

17:03.000 --> 17:04.000
Yes.

17:04.709 --> 17:05.876
Ueno.

17:06.375 --> 17:08.375
What do you have to say? You sit next to him.

17:08.541 --> 17:10.541
Well... so...

17:10.709 --> 17:14.751
He was just joking around... I tried to stop-

17:14.917 --> 17:15.626
What?

17:15.751 --> 17:17.125
What about you, Shimada?

17:17.291 --> 17:18.666
I'd been saying

17:18.791 --> 17:21.834
"Hey, stop it!" to him,

17:21.959 --> 17:23.501
but Shoya wouldn't listen.

17:23.626 --> 17:24.334
What!?

17:24.626 --> 17:26.791
Hey, Shimada,

17:26.917 --> 17:29.459
We all did this together, didn't we?

17:29.584 --> 17:32.209
And, the girls said terrible
things about her so many times.

17:34.077 --> 17:35.077
Hey!

17:35.292 --> 17:37.250
Especially Ueno and Kawai.

17:37.375 --> 17:38.375
What!?

17:39.250 --> 17:40.876
How cruel you are...

17:41.417 --> 17:44.083
I never did such things.

17:44.209 --> 17:45.834
Why are you telling such lies?

17:45.959 --> 17:47.667
Ishida-kun, you were terrible too.

17:47.792 --> 17:49.334
You made her cry.

18:07.542 --> 18:09.918
Huh? Why is this still here...?

18:20.918 --> 18:22.792
I see. Yes.

18:23.417 --> 18:26.459
I'm very sorry.

18:27.209 --> 18:29.375
I see. I see.

18:29.667 --> 18:31.209
Thank you for calling.

18:33.918 --> 18:35.375
Shoya!

18:35.626 --> 18:37.501
Wait a minute, Shoya!

18:38.417 --> 18:39.542
Shoya.

18:40.125 --> 18:41.876
I just got a call from school.

18:42.751 --> 18:43.751
You...

18:43.834 --> 18:45.876
Why are you all wet?

18:46.042 --> 18:48.751
Shut up! I jumped in the river like always.

18:48.876 --> 18:50.375
Wait, Shoya.

18:50.501 --> 18:52.167
Did you cause trouble with someone?

18:52.292 --> 18:54.167
I don't know.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.417
Is what your teacher said true?

18:57.542 --> 18:59.792
Y... Yes!

19:02.209 --> 19:05.584
Get ready to go out right now.
We have to meet Nishimiya-san.

19:11.468 --> 19:12.468
(Mizuho Bank)

20:12.959 --> 20:15.209
Sho-chan, let's go home.

20:16.209 --> 20:18.876
Be a good boy from tomorrow, OK?

20:22.751 --> 20:23.751
Huh? It's missing...

20:23.959 --> 20:28.083
Great men and women experienced
hard times, and...

20:50.042 --> 20:51.042
Huh?

20:51.626 --> 20:52.792
What?

20:53.000 --> 20:54.209
What is she doing?

20:56.125 --> 20:58.918
Hey, what are you doing with my desk?

21:04.042 --> 21:06.792
What were you doing? Disgusting!

21:12.417 --> 21:14.125
Same smile again.

21:14.876 --> 21:17.250
Don't pretend to be a good girl!

21:18.876 --> 21:19.876
What?

21:20.000 --> 21:22.250
If you wanna say something to me, say it now!

21:22.375 --> 21:25.083
You are always showing that disgusting smile.

21:25.209 --> 21:27.000
You are angry, aren't you!?

21:27.125 --> 21:28.125
Hey!

21:28.250 --> 21:29.375
Say something!

21:30.501 --> 21:31.626
Ouch!

21:31.834 --> 21:32.876
What you are doing!

21:34.000 --> 21:35.000
What do you mean!

21:45.584 --> 21:47.334
Doigg mah bezd...

21:49.250 --> 21:52.000
I'b doigg mah bezd!

21:52.417 --> 21:54.834
What are you saying!

21:58.417 --> 21:59.709
What!

21:59.834 --> 22:01.667
I cannot understand what you are saying!

22:21.747 --> 22:22.747
"Disappear"

22:30.167 --> 22:31.542
Crap...

22:31.667 --> 22:33.042
She is so disgusting...

22:34.417 --> 22:37.042
Nishimiya-san has transferred to another school.

22:38.667 --> 22:40.375
Huh?

22:40.501 --> 22:44.250
Hey, the class journal was not submitted today.

22:44.375 --> 22:46.626
Who is in charge?

22:47.083 --> 22:50.417
And, who is in charge of the flowers?

23:11.713 --> 23:13.446
"Sign Language Study Club"

23:24.626 --> 23:27.209
Hi, Shoko-chan. Hello.

23:37.626 --> 23:38.667
Nishimiya!

23:44.667 --> 23:47.250
Do you remember me?

23:47.375 --> 23:49.542
I was your classmate in elementary school...

23:49.959 --> 23:52.334
Shoya Ishida.

24:02.292 --> 24:03.792
Nishimiya?

24:04.125 --> 24:05.250
Wait!

24:10.062 --> 24:11.062
Nishimiya!

24:14.042 --> 24:15.292
Where?

24:16.209 --> 24:17.375
Nishimiya.

24:22.375 --> 24:23.375
H... Hi.

24:27.542 --> 24:29.459
Well...

24:31.417 --> 24:32.417
Here it is.

24:32.584 --> 24:34.709
I came here to give this to you.

24:37.959 --> 24:39.119
This is what you left behind.

24:44.584 --> 24:47.667
You're asking, "Why sign language?"

24:47.876 --> 24:49.042
I learned it.

24:49.167 --> 24:51.584
So, here...

24:55.709 --> 24:58.792
You might not want to see this again.

25:03.375 --> 25:05.000
Well...

25:05.918 --> 25:07.501
I... and...

25:07.626 --> 25:08.709
Nishimiya,

25:10.584 --> 25:12.167
Can we be...

25:13.042 --> 25:14.417
friends?

25:15.792 --> 25:17.417
Damn, what am I saying!?

25:18.459 --> 25:21.792
H... hey, you said so in the past.

25:21.918 --> 25:23.417
I finally understood what you said...

25:28.083 --> 25:29.417
Oh... Please don't cry.

25:31.042 --> 25:33.417
Please don't cry, Nishimiya.

25:39.250 --> 25:44.667
Can I be friends with you?

25:45.042 --> 25:46.584
Sho-tan,

25:47.667 --> 25:49.375
Sho-tan,

25:49.918 --> 25:53.125
Sho-tan, wake up!

25:55.834 --> 25:57.501
Breakfast!

26:02.501 --> 26:05.709
Sho-chan, wake up!

26:07.250 --> 26:09.375
Good morning, Maria.

26:10.083 --> 26:12.542
Sho-tan woke up!

26:29.751 --> 26:31.375
I'm leaving.

26:31.501 --> 26:34.584
Bye bye, Mom!

26:34.876 --> 26:36.000
Here, Sho-chan.

26:38.334 --> 26:40.209
Let's eat.

26:40.334 --> 26:42.292
Dig in!

26:46.584 --> 26:48.000
Huh?

26:48.125 --> 26:50.250
What's with the smile?

26:51.834 --> 26:53.834
Because of...

26:54.876 --> 26:55.667
this!

26:55.792 --> 26:56.626
Oh.

26:56.751 --> 26:59.209
You worked hard,

26:59.334 --> 27:02.542
and you sold everything, even the bedding.

27:04.000 --> 27:07.209
I'm delighted for all of your effort.

27:09.876 --> 27:12.209
By the way, Sho-chan...

27:13.667 --> 27:15.751
Why did you try to kill yourself?

27:18.167 --> 27:19.667
Yeah, actually,

27:19.792 --> 27:22.459
It's a long story you know,

27:22.584 --> 27:24.334
But it's because...

27:24.459 --> 27:25.959
I knew it...

27:26.125 --> 27:27.501
Huh!?

27:27.709 --> 27:29.834
I knew it!

27:29.959 --> 27:31.667
I knew something was going on with you!

27:32.209 --> 27:36.000
Your room was extraordinarily empty,
your phone was out of service,

27:36.125 --> 27:39.000
and the calendar...

27:39.459 --> 27:42.375
Pages after April were torn off...

27:43.167 --> 27:46.375
Right now promise you will never try to
kill yourself, or I'll burn this.

27:46.501 --> 27:49.626
For earning the 1,700,000 yen
you worked so hard for!

27:52.417 --> 27:54.792
Hey, are you listening to me!?

27:55.167 --> 27:56.834
Huh!?

27:56.959 --> 27:58.125
Don't be stupid, mom...

27:58.250 --> 28:00.185
<i>You are</i> stupid, what an ungrateful child you are!

28:00.209 --> 28:01.751
Hey, well, ah...

28:01.918 --> 28:02.918
Sorry.

28:03.000 --> 28:04.375
I'm really sorry.

28:04.501 --> 28:05.292
I'll stop.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.042
I'll stop. I'm sorry.

28:07.167 --> 28:09.083
You'll stop what, say it clearly!

28:09.918 --> 28:11.542
I'll stop trying to kill myself!

28:11.667 --> 28:13.792
I'll stop trying to kill myself!

28:14.542 --> 28:15.834
Really?

28:16.417 --> 28:17.542
Really!

28:18.334 --> 28:20.292
OK, that's a promise.

28:21.959 --> 28:24.083
Hey! Mom!

28:26.125 --> 28:27.417
Ouch!

28:28.375 --> 28:29.375
Hey, water, water!

28:38.501 --> 28:40.000
Yesterday, I thought about

28:40.167 --> 28:43.751
killing myself by jumping into a
river from some very high bridge.

28:45.167 --> 28:48.751
The reason I went to meet Nishimiya because
it was the final formality before it.

28:49.667 --> 28:53.334
It was the biggest challenge of my life

28:53.459 --> 28:55.292
but the story has changed...

29:09.584 --> 29:11.167
"Friend"

29:15.959 --> 29:17.918
Stupid! Why did I say such a thing!?

29:19.334 --> 29:22.250
When I just entered junior
high school, Shimada said,

29:23.000 --> 29:27.459
You'd better stay away from
a guy named Shoya Ishida.

29:27.584 --> 29:28.626
He is...

29:28.959 --> 29:30.959
a bully.

29:34.918 --> 29:39.918
What I did back then had
all come back to haunt me.

29:40.375 --> 29:42.167
I fully realized

29:42.292 --> 29:46.626
that I had to take full
responsibility for what I had done.

29:47.167 --> 29:50.667
And I was isolated.

29:51.042 --> 29:53.042
Good morning.

30:28.542 --> 30:30.417
Well then

30:30.709 --> 30:33.834
Translate these sentences by the next lesson.

30:43.292 --> 30:44.292
Ishida-kun.

30:44.417 --> 30:45.501
H-hi.

30:45.792 --> 30:47.292
Kawai...

30:47.417 --> 30:50.083
Can I collect your math
homework if you finished it?

30:50.250 --> 30:52.042
Oh... sorry, I forgot it.

30:52.167 --> 30:53.292
OK, I see.

30:53.417 --> 30:55.351
Please finish it soon as
the deadline is coming up.

30:55.375 --> 30:57.501
Yes, I will. Sorry.

31:00.501 --> 31:02.083
Let's have lunch outside.

31:04.417 --> 31:08.375
"You can see Ishida-kun is always alone."

31:08.501 --> 31:11.334
"Everyone knows it."

31:11.459 --> 31:13.709
Oh, really?

31:13.876 --> 31:16.834
"Oh, he is looking at us as always."

31:16.959 --> 31:19.834
"Isn't he feeling desolate,
always being alone?"

31:19.959 --> 31:21.876
"He will always be the same."

31:22.000 --> 31:23.334
"Why is he still living?"

31:28.876 --> 31:30.792
H... Hi, here it is.

31:30.918 --> 31:32.667
I just bought this limited edition, and...

31:32.834 --> 31:33.959
Oh...

31:34.083 --> 31:35.959
I quit being a fan of them.

31:36.250 --> 31:37.709
Me too.

31:43.334 --> 31:44.626
That's the reality...

32:01.709 --> 32:02.751
Huh?

32:04.167 --> 32:06.584
I remember that hair.

32:08.209 --> 32:09.709
Who is he?

32:20.292 --> 32:21.501
I wonder,

32:21.792 --> 32:24.584
can I meet Nishimiya again?

32:25.125 --> 32:28.000
She said she feeds the carp in the river.

32:28.626 --> 32:31.792
Do I have a reason?

32:34.167 --> 32:36.292
Can I see her to apologize for what I did?

32:37.876 --> 32:40.417
She said she will be there every Tuesday.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.939
Would it be weird if I see her again?

32:55.083 --> 32:57.125
I'm home.

33:07.584 --> 33:09.000
Sho---chan?

33:09.125 --> 33:10.125
Whoops,

33:10.250 --> 33:11.876
You surprised me.

33:12.375 --> 33:13.417
What?

33:15.709 --> 33:18.083
I'm very sorry for what happened this morning.

33:18.250 --> 33:22.292
I burned the money you worked so hard for.

33:24.125 --> 33:28.334
But I didn't want to use any of the money

33:28.459 --> 33:29.959
that you saved to die.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.959
Sorry, I'll save up again.

33:34.125 --> 33:36.167
Thanks.

33:36.292 --> 33:38.334
You can take your time, OK?

33:38.501 --> 33:40.792
Are you hungry? Let's have dinner.

33:40.918 --> 33:42.667
Hungry!

33:52.626 --> 33:54.542
Tuesday.

33:58.876 --> 34:01.876
Hey you, why don't you lend me your bike?

34:02.074 --> 34:02.774
Me?

34:02.825 --> 34:05.742
Oh, I remember that guy.

34:06.167 --> 34:09.292
I left something behind.
I want to go home and get it.

34:09.417 --> 34:12.250
Huh? What are you saying?

34:12.375 --> 34:14.208
You should use your own bike.

34:14.333 --> 34:17.542
I asked you 'cause I don't have one.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.876
Stop it please.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Hey, don't resist.

34:21.083 --> 34:22.417
Oops. Stop it!

34:23.042 --> 34:24.751
Someone please help me!

34:26.351 --> 34:27.451
Someone!

34:27.958 --> 34:29.458
Oh, dear.

34:29.751 --> 34:31.143
Please, please help me! Help! Help!

34:31.167 --> 34:32.667
Shut up!

34:36.042 --> 34:37.918
Stop resisting!

34:38.083 --> 34:40.000
H... hey.

34:40.792 --> 34:42.250
I... I'll lend you mine.

34:42.751 --> 34:46.333
Really!? You are super!

34:50.083 --> 34:52.292
It was ripped off...

34:53.250 --> 34:55.876
Actually, today of all days is Tuesday.

34:56.042 --> 34:59.501
Does this mean I should not see her again?

35:00.209 --> 35:02.417
Of course I still can go on foot,

35:03.000 --> 35:05.667
but it seems as if something
is telling me not to go.

35:06.792 --> 35:08.918
I need an excuse.

35:12.876 --> 35:15.959
Something very smart,

35:16.083 --> 35:18.250
and natural reason to see her again.

35:23.334 --> 35:25.959
A discount coupon for fresh baked bread?

35:27.501 --> 35:28.876
That's it!

35:29.042 --> 35:31.000
Uh... Is Nishimiya-san here?

35:31.584 --> 35:32.709
No, she isn't

35:33.626 --> 35:34.667
She is, isn't she?

35:34.792 --> 35:36.501
No, she isn't

35:37.250 --> 35:39.626
Shoko Nishimiya isn't here.

35:40.501 --> 35:41.709
Sorry but,

35:42.083 --> 35:44.876
are you really a friend of Shoko?

35:45.918 --> 35:47.167
Bye.

35:53.834 --> 35:55.292
Nothing.

35:56.709 --> 35:58.876
I found a rat.

35:59.042 --> 36:01.167
A big creepy one.

36:04.083 --> 36:06.626
Don't be afraid. It won't come again.

36:14.292 --> 36:16.083
Friend...

36:27.584 --> 36:28.667
Huh?

36:31.334 --> 36:32.876
Why... is he here?

36:34.209 --> 36:35.792
O--Oh, there you are!

36:36.042 --> 36:37.667
Ishida-kun!

36:37.792 --> 36:39.876
Look! Look!

36:40.000 --> 36:42.542
A bike! It's yours, isn't it?

36:44.334 --> 36:46.042
Good timing!

36:46.751 --> 36:50.167
Huh, you were lucky that your
address was written on the bike.

36:50.542 --> 36:53.709
Wh... where was the bike?

36:53.876 --> 36:55.626
It was abandoned in a rice paddy!

36:56.083 --> 36:58.292
I was looking all over for it!

36:58.709 --> 37:01.876
I'm glad I got it back to you!

37:09.209 --> 37:10.626
Is something wrong, Ishida-kun?

37:11.000 --> 37:11.667
H-hey

37:11.792 --> 37:13.918
Well...

37:14.083 --> 37:15.334
Your name?

37:15.459 --> 37:17.792
Oops! I'm Nagatsuka!

37:18.375 --> 37:20.250
I sit just behind you in the class.

37:20.375 --> 37:21.876
Oh, I see.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.542
Won't you eat some bread?

37:23.959 --> 37:26.959
This is so good, Nagatsuka-kun.

37:27.292 --> 37:29.209
Ishida-kun.

37:29.792 --> 37:31.083
Ishida-kun!

37:32.501 --> 37:34.542
Good morning!

37:34.709 --> 37:36.083
H... Hi, good morning!

37:38.501 --> 37:39.501
Ishida-kun!

37:40.334 --> 37:42.167
Why don't we hang out after school?

37:42.501 --> 37:44.667
Because we are now friends.

37:45.334 --> 37:47.667
Ishida-kun, come here, come here!

38:10.667 --> 38:12.834
What's wrong with you, Ya-sho?

38:13.125 --> 38:14.125
Well.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.459
Nothing.

38:15.584 --> 38:16.918
Ya... "Ya-sho"?

38:17.042 --> 38:18.918
Sounds like a "big friend", doesn't it?

38:22.083 --> 38:23.959
Anyway, what are you worrying about?

38:24.417 --> 38:27.876
You can tell me anything,
cause we are true friends.

38:32.125 --> 38:34.459
Nagatsuka-kun.

38:34.834 --> 38:38.000
What is the definition of "friends"?

38:38.334 --> 38:39.918
Is it a kind of license,

38:40.042 --> 38:42.167
or right or something like that,

38:43.000 --> 38:45.542
to become friends with someone.

38:46.459 --> 38:48.125
Hey, Ya-sho.

38:51.542 --> 38:52.751
Give me your hand.

38:58.107 --> 38:59.107
Hey, hey.

39:06.501 --> 39:08.501
This is friendship.

39:08.709 --> 39:10.959
I think, Ishida-kun,

39:11.083 --> 39:16.209
friendship exists beyond words and logic.

39:16.459 --> 39:19.501
License? No such things are needed.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.209
It's a ridiculous idea.

39:23.709 --> 39:24.709
She is not here.

39:25.501 --> 39:26.501
She is, isn't she?

39:26.751 --> 39:27.751
She isn't!

39:28.083 --> 39:30.626
Huh, who are you anyway?

39:30.751 --> 39:33.125
I'm Shoko's boyfriend.

39:34.667 --> 39:36.959
Oops!... Dropped.

39:37.125 --> 39:39.751
Um, it isn't about that,
it's just that the bread...

39:40.209 --> 39:41.959
But, really?

39:42.083 --> 39:44.542
Nishimiya likes younger guys.

39:44.626 --> 39:47.459
I'm a little surprised by that.

39:47.584 --> 39:49.542
OK, can you at least give this bread to her?

39:49.667 --> 39:50.417
This is very good bread.

39:50.542 --> 39:51.542
Hey.

39:51.667 --> 39:56.125
Don't come here again,
if you only want to ease your guilt.

39:59.542 --> 40:01.083
Are you satisfied?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.000
Then bye.

40:04.042 --> 40:05.417
Hey boy!

40:05.542 --> 40:08.334
My friend wants to see Nishimiya-san!

40:08.459 --> 40:11.584
Stop complaining and bring her here right now!

40:11.709 --> 40:13.918
Nagatsuka-kun, why are you here?

40:14.959 --> 40:15.834
I followed you.

40:15.959 --> 40:17.709
Sounds like a behavior of best friends?

40:17.959 --> 40:21.375
Haha, so the friend of a turd had a turd hair.

40:21.501 --> 40:23.083
Hey, you turd-hair!

40:24.000 --> 40:26.209
Wh---what are you saying?!

40:27.167 --> 40:29.751
Say that again boy!

40:29.876 --> 40:32.042
Turd-hair, turd-hair, turd-hair!

40:32.167 --> 40:34.709
What's happening?

40:34.834 --> 40:35.918
Is that Yuzuru-chan?

40:36.083 --> 40:37.416
Oh, no. They are fighting.

40:37.417 --> 40:38.125
You, small boy!

40:38.250 --> 40:40.459
Nagatsuka-kun

40:40.667 --> 40:42.167
Stop it, OK?

40:42.417 --> 40:44.834
This is enough, so let's go home.

40:44.959 --> 40:46.334
Nagatsuka-ku...

40:47.292 --> 40:50.125
Oh? Aren't you the boy from the other day?

40:50.584 --> 40:53.167
I--it's not like that!

40:53.501 --> 40:54.981
Nagatsuka-kun, sorry for leaving you!

41:00.542 --> 41:01.751
Crap!

41:02.292 --> 41:04.042
Crap, she found him.

41:04.167 --> 41:05.709
Good for you, Ishida-kun!

41:07.918 --> 41:09.334
Hey boy.

41:09.417 --> 41:11.000
You are peeping now, aren't you?

41:11.584 --> 41:13.667
Let me use it now!

41:14.459 --> 41:15.501
What?

41:15.626 --> 41:18.459
Ishida-kun is waving his
hands and doing something!?

41:18.584 --> 41:19.959
It's sign language.

41:20.083 --> 41:21.125
Really!?

41:21.542 --> 41:25.292
Wow, I didn't know he knew that.

41:25.417 --> 41:27.676
Hey, you can read sign language.

41:27.679 --> 41:28.679
Then translate it for me!

41:30.876 --> 41:33.834
Who was that turd-hair just now?

41:35.000 --> 41:37.209
I don't know any turd-head.

41:37.792 --> 41:39.626
Ugh, he was so creepy!

41:39.834 --> 41:41.918
S-T-O-P J-O-K-I-N-G!

41:42.042 --> 41:43.667
Leave me alone!

41:43.918 --> 41:45.834
Tsk!

41:46.042 --> 41:48.125
Be careful not to fall, boy.

41:48.626 --> 41:50.292
"Honestly,"

41:50.959 --> 41:53.876
"I was not sure if it was
OK for me to see you again."

41:54.667 --> 41:56.918
"A kind of license to be friends with you"

41:57.083 --> 42:01.542
"I have been for looking you the past two weeks."

42:02.292 --> 42:04.083
"An excuse to"

42:04.834 --> 42:07.542
"See you again"

42:09.542 --> 42:11.417
"I have been looking for one."

42:14.083 --> 42:15.083
Ishida-kun...

42:15.292 --> 42:16.417
Huh?

42:16.584 --> 42:18.125
"I'm glad."

42:18.292 --> 42:21.417
"I thought"

42:21.584 --> 42:22.792
"the same thing as you."

42:23.751 --> 42:25.292
"That is so strange."

42:26.792 --> 42:28.667
Well...

42:28.834 --> 42:31.584
Nishimiya, here you go. Bread,

42:31.751 --> 42:32.792
To feed the carp.

42:39.209 --> 42:40.876
Feeding them is fun, isn't it?

42:42.417 --> 42:43.918
Oh, I just remembered.

42:48.709 --> 42:49.709
Huh?

42:59.907 --> 43:00.907
Well...

43:03.292 --> 43:04.292
Nishimiya...

43:04.375 --> 43:06.209
Y... you should not read it

43:06.334 --> 43:07.417
too much!

43:17.542 --> 43:19.042
Hey! wait, Nishimiya!

43:23.250 --> 43:24.459
Oh! She fell!

43:24.584 --> 43:26.709
What!? Something happened to Ishida-kun!?

43:26.834 --> 43:27.459
Hey!

43:27.584 --> 43:28.876
Hey, boy!

43:29.626 --> 43:31.626
Oops! Ishida-kun fell to the river!

43:31.751 --> 43:32.751
Why!?

43:33.000 --> 43:33.834
Ouch!

43:33.959 --> 43:35.167
Why did you do it!

43:48.751 --> 43:50.250
Oops, what is this creepy thing!?

43:50.501 --> 43:52.209
Nishimiya.

44:00.876 --> 44:02.083
Nishimiya!

44:04.459 --> 44:07.167
Sorry for dropping the notebook.

44:17.167 --> 44:18.918
See you.

44:33.792 --> 44:36.167
Shoko, you are such an idiot...

44:48.083 --> 44:49.501
Ha ha...

44:51.209 --> 44:52.751
Idiot!

44:52.876 --> 44:54.459
Did you see this?

44:54.584 --> 44:56.918
Hey, isn't this guy Ishida-kun?

44:58.584 --> 45:00.042
"See you again"

45:01.417 --> 45:02.417
Can I?

45:05.125 --> 45:07.209
Hey.

45:07.918 --> 45:09.667
This is Ishida-kun, isn't it?

45:10.167 --> 45:11.167
This guy.

45:11.501 --> 45:12.501
What?

45:12.626 --> 45:14.334
What's this?

45:19.292 --> 45:22.918
Ishida-kun, come to the
teachers' room right now.

45:23.318 --> 45:24.583
"Notice of short-term suspension
from school - Shoya Ishida"

45:24.584 --> 45:28.334
"I am very sorry that I jumped
into Suimon River from a bridge,

45:28.459 --> 45:31.000
where it was prohibited to do so, and...

45:31.125 --> 45:33.334
uploading that photo to the web..."

45:33.459 --> 45:34.959
Hey, Shoya.

45:35.334 --> 45:36.083
What?

45:36.250 --> 45:40.292
Sorry but could you pick
up Maria from the nursery?

45:40.417 --> 45:43.042
I'm suspended from school
and prohibited to go out.

45:43.167 --> 45:46.250
It will be OK if you
do it quickly. Please!!

45:46.375 --> 45:47.584
H... hey!!

46:04.375 --> 46:07.792
Maria, let's go home now!

46:07.918 --> 46:09.083
Sho-tan!

46:09.584 --> 46:11.542
Someone is in there!

46:11.751 --> 46:13.125
Ouch!

46:17.873 --> 46:18.873
Hey.

46:19.292 --> 46:21.584
Hey, are you OK?

46:24.042 --> 46:27.042
Aren't you Nishimiya's boyfriend?

46:27.375 --> 46:28.375
You'll catch a cold.

46:29.459 --> 46:32.375
Huh? Oh, the rat.

46:34.209 --> 46:37.292
What are you doing here?

46:39.542 --> 46:40.959
Shoes?

46:44.167 --> 46:45.567
...Why don't you get angry with me?

46:45.959 --> 46:46.959
What?

46:49.000 --> 46:52.334
I am the person who uploaded the photo.

46:52.459 --> 46:54.459
Oh, you did it.

46:56.626 --> 46:57.959
I did it.

46:58.083 --> 46:59.834
I am relieved to hear that.

47:00.292 --> 47:02.125
Why?

47:02.667 --> 47:07.000
I would like to know the reason why myself.

47:07.417 --> 47:08.709
Get mad at me.

47:08.834 --> 47:10.626
I cannot.

47:10.751 --> 47:13.459
Originally, everything was my fault.

47:13.792 --> 47:15.167
Sho-tan!

47:15.292 --> 47:17.292
I am hungry!

47:17.709 --> 47:19.083
OK!

47:19.209 --> 47:21.125
Then I'll go home.

47:21.250 --> 47:22.834
You go home, too.

47:23.459 --> 47:25.792
Ha ha, you have a kid.

47:25.918 --> 47:27.459
Ouch!

47:27.584 --> 47:29.209
It's not mine, my sis's.

47:39.709 --> 47:40.709
Hey!

47:43.209 --> 47:45.083
Hi Yuzuru-chan,

47:45.459 --> 47:47.501
Please eat enough!

47:47.626 --> 47:48.626
What about sis?

47:49.250 --> 47:50.918
She is working late today.

47:52.542 --> 47:54.167
Maria, isn't it too hot?

47:54.292 --> 47:56.209
No, it's good!

47:56.334 --> 47:58.751
Yuzuru-kun, why don't you eat?

47:59.584 --> 48:01.250
Hi, Yuzuru-kun!

48:02.709 --> 48:03.709
Please!

48:33.459 --> 48:34.834
Crap...

48:55.375 --> 48:56.501
Huh?

48:58.083 --> 48:59.292
What's the matter with you.

49:00.375 --> 49:02.295
I was worried when you disappeared in the night.

49:03.959 --> 49:05.334
Here! An umbrella.

49:06.083 --> 49:07.083
O--oh!

49:07.209 --> 49:08.709
Anyway, use it!

49:08.834 --> 49:10.209
Well, please use it now.

49:11.751 --> 49:12.834
Thank you.

49:13.209 --> 49:14.792
Well, excuse me.

49:14.918 --> 49:16.125
I knew that.

49:18.792 --> 49:20.083
Here! I'll give you these.

49:20.209 --> 49:21.626
This was mine, but

49:22.042 --> 49:24.501
I don't use them anymore.
You can have it.

49:26.876 --> 49:29.959
Why did you run away from home?

49:31.709 --> 49:33.959
I had an argument with Shoko.

49:34.167 --> 49:36.083
Oh...

49:36.250 --> 49:38.167
That's kind of typical

49:38.334 --> 49:41.501
for couples, isn't it?

49:41.959 --> 49:43.042
Yes.

49:43.417 --> 49:45.959
I used Shoko's shampoo without her permission.

49:46.209 --> 49:47.417
Eh?

49:47.584 --> 49:49.709
She told me she doesn't need me.

49:51.918 --> 49:54.459
Hey, you two are living together!?

49:57.542 --> 49:59.667
Use your umbrella.

49:59.792 --> 50:01.083
You have only one, don't you?

50:02.292 --> 50:05.667
It's my fault, I brought only one umbrella.

50:05.918 --> 50:09.792
I don't want Nishimiya's
boyfriend to get wet and sick.

50:12.209 --> 50:13.542
Hey you.

50:14.042 --> 50:16.876
What kind of a man you intend
to be? A hypocrite?

50:17.125 --> 50:17.834
What!?

50:17.959 --> 50:20.501
You like taking care of a poor stray cat?

50:20.709 --> 50:22.542
Or do you make fun when doing it.

50:23.167 --> 50:26.209
And you also made fun of her
hearing disability, I know.

50:26.334 --> 50:27.375
Hey.

50:27.501 --> 50:30.501
And now you learned sign language, huh?

50:31.000 --> 50:31.709
What's this?

50:31.834 --> 50:34.209
Do you think you changed into a good person?

50:34.709 --> 50:36.918
You are disgusting.

50:40.918 --> 50:42.167
I see.

50:42.626 --> 50:45.626
It's natural you know what I did,
Nishimiya would have told you.

50:46.918 --> 50:49.167
Yes. You are right.

50:49.584 --> 50:51.667
I'm the worst human being alive.

50:52.292 --> 50:54.918
I'm the one who doesn't deserve to live.

50:55.959 --> 50:57.209
But, at least,

50:58.042 --> 51:01.626
I thought I can prevent
Nishimiya from crying again.

51:02.042 --> 51:05.918
Of course, I have no intention
to interfere with the two of you.

51:06.042 --> 51:07.751
No intention. Ever.

51:08.918 --> 51:10.584
But, actually,

51:10.751 --> 51:12.918
It's about myself, too...

51:28.918 --> 51:29.959
Thanks, we're here.

51:30.083 --> 51:31.209
OK.

51:33.459 --> 51:34.876
Well...

51:35.501 --> 51:39.000
I'm very sorry that you
believed everything what I said...

51:39.417 --> 51:40.751
But actually I'm Shoko's...

51:42.459 --> 51:43.459
You understand?

51:50.459 --> 51:51.501
Ehh!

51:51.626 --> 51:52.706
You are her little sister!?

51:52.792 --> 51:53.792
Bye!

52:01.834 --> 52:04.834
Oh, Nishimiya-san's mother...

52:09.584 --> 52:10.792
Hey, let's go.

52:12.083 --> 52:14.709
Hey, that hurts!

52:16.417 --> 52:18.626
I'm very sorry...

52:22.250 --> 52:24.125
I'm home.

52:24.417 --> 52:25.417
Yu-ju,

52:25.459 --> 52:26.834
Hey, sis!

52:26.959 --> 52:28.959
I'b zorry, I'b zorry!

52:29.334 --> 52:31.417
It's all right, no problem.

52:31.834 --> 52:32.626
Hey.

52:32.751 --> 52:35.459
I wanna drink gramma's beefsteak plant juice.

52:36.167 --> 52:37.375
Yuzuru.

52:37.709 --> 52:39.876
You shouldn't be friends with that boy.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.876
The same goes for you, Shoko.

52:44.667 --> 52:47.000
We can decide by ourselves.

52:47.125 --> 52:48.918
Both of us.

52:51.000 --> 52:52.292
Hey boy!

52:52.417 --> 52:54.125
Nice to see you!

52:54.250 --> 52:55.584
Why are you here today?

52:55.918 --> 52:57.838
To return his umbrella I borrowed the other day.

52:57.959 --> 52:58.959
Oh boy.

52:59.042 --> 53:01.167
You are doing a good thing.

53:01.292 --> 53:03.834
Nagatsuka-kun, she is not a boy...

53:04.292 --> 53:06.751
She's Nishimiya's little sister.

53:08.209 --> 53:10.083
Of course, I knew that.

53:15.209 --> 53:18.083
I'm glad to see a friend of
my best friend Ya-sho.

53:18.876 --> 53:20.083
He is my classmate,

53:20.209 --> 53:22.918
Na-ga-tsu-ka.

53:26.250 --> 53:27.042
Hey, hey!

53:27.167 --> 53:28.334
Well...

53:29.083 --> 53:31.042
I got a new smartphone.

53:31.167 --> 53:32.167
Well...

53:32.250 --> 53:34.918
Do you have a smartphone too?

53:36.083 --> 53:38.375
Then I guess you enjoy texting?

53:38.626 --> 53:40.042
To whom?

53:40.167 --> 53:41.709
Your classmates?

53:42.292 --> 53:43.542
Oh, that's nice.

53:43.667 --> 53:46.792
Then do you have someone you want to add?

53:47.459 --> 53:50.125
The address of someone you'd like to know.

53:50.626 --> 53:53.542
Great, then my address is...

53:54.167 --> 53:55.167
What?

53:55.792 --> 53:58.417
Sa... Ha... Ra.

54:02.250 --> 54:04.876
Sahara-san? The classmate
from elementary school?

54:11.459 --> 54:13.292
Ya-sho, Ya-sho!

54:13.584 --> 54:14.584
Well?

54:14.667 --> 54:17.667
Are you going to look for Sahara-san?

54:18.125 --> 54:21.125
Cut it out. That's not true.

54:21.459 --> 54:24.667
But I really think Kawai-san is very clever.

54:25.083 --> 54:27.584
Kawai-san...

54:28.542 --> 54:29.542
Ya-sho?

54:29.709 --> 54:30.918
But Mashiba-kun is also...

54:31.042 --> 54:32.375
Kawai-san...?

54:32.501 --> 54:34.584
What?

54:34.751 --> 54:36.167
I... I have

54:36.250 --> 54:37.709
something to ask of you.

54:38.250 --> 54:40.501
Do you know the phone number
or something to contact

54:40.626 --> 54:43.334
Sahara-san, our classmate
from elementary school?

54:43.834 --> 54:45.459
Sahara-san?

54:45.667 --> 54:47.501
Sorry, I don't know,

54:47.626 --> 54:50.167
But I know her school,

54:50.334 --> 54:52.254
as she goes to the same high school as Nao-chan.

54:52.501 --> 54:55.167
Taiyo Girl's High School...

54:56.167 --> 54:57.709
Shoot! I don't have enough money.

54:57.876 --> 54:58.959
Ishida-kun.

54:59.125 --> 55:00.626
Use this.

55:00.918 --> 55:03.667
What!? I don't need that much!

55:03.792 --> 55:05.876
Don't mind, Ya-sho.

55:06.000 --> 55:09.209
When you need travel, meal,
and then love hotel expenses,

55:09.334 --> 55:12.083
So it's safe to have that much.

55:12.209 --> 55:13.375
Hey!

55:13.792 --> 55:15.501
Here we are!

55:17.209 --> 55:18.542
My sis says

55:18.667 --> 55:22.375
She's pissed at you since you are looking
for a old classmate without her.

55:22.501 --> 55:25.167
So take her with you, Ishida.

55:48.000 --> 55:49.000
Are you tired?

55:49.001 --> 55:51.500
Thank you for today.

55:53.561 --> 56:01.561
I was happy to hear that you are
trying to look for Sahara-san for me.

56:02.000 --> 56:06.000
I heard a lot about you from Yuzuru.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.500
I'm very happy to be with you today!

56:24.501 --> 56:27.209
Well...

56:27.667 --> 56:29.834
Walking from here...

56:31.792 --> 56:33.375
Sho-chan?

56:33.501 --> 56:35.167
Sorry.

56:35.292 --> 56:36.417
Sho-chan!

56:37.834 --> 56:40.667
It's me! Sahara!

56:40.876 --> 56:42.459
Do you remember me?

56:43.209 --> 56:44.918
Hello!

56:45.042 --> 56:47.125
Huh? Ishida-kun?

56:48.375 --> 56:49.417
Heh heh heh.

56:50.167 --> 56:52.159
Long time no see.

56:57.042 --> 57:00.584
I continued to study sign language after that.

57:01.083 --> 57:02.667
Is this correct?

57:03.792 --> 57:06.250
I disappeared from elementary school

57:08.918 --> 57:10.083
I'm sorry.

57:10.667 --> 57:14.334
I have been thinking of Sho-chan for long time.

57:15.292 --> 57:17.667
I'm happy to see you again.

57:18.000 --> 57:19.334
And surprised as well.

57:25.083 --> 57:26.083
Uh huh...

57:26.125 --> 57:27.334
Oh, really?

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
Huh, and now,

57:31.167 --> 57:35.292
What high school do you go to now?

57:37.334 --> 57:38.334
I see.

57:38.459 --> 57:40.667
And, hey, your chest has grown.

57:40.792 --> 57:41.792
What's your cup size?

57:42.083 --> 57:43.283
I think I'll check for myself!

57:47.459 --> 57:49.834
Where are you going?

57:49.959 --> 57:52.584
To the restroom.

57:52.751 --> 57:54.542
OK.

57:58.167 --> 58:02.000
Hello! We are handing out
discount coupons for you!

58:02.167 --> 58:04.417
Discount coupons!

58:12.167 --> 58:14.209
Ueno...

58:14.792 --> 58:15.959
Discount coupons!

58:16.083 --> 58:18.250
Here you go!

58:25.417 --> 58:27.417
"Meow Meow Club"...

58:31.000 --> 58:32.000
From: Sahara-san

58:32.001 --> 58:33.626
It's great that you learned sign language.

58:33.650 --> 58:35.450
And thank you for bringing us together again!

58:39.334 --> 58:40.709
Oh!

58:40.834 --> 58:43.042
Sahara is really something.

58:43.959 --> 58:45.751
I could never be like her...

58:46.209 --> 58:47.375
Hmm?

58:47.667 --> 58:50.584
Can I bring Ueno along, too?

58:51.125 --> 58:54.042
Huh? That's impossible, you know?

58:54.167 --> 58:55.751
Yeah, I know, I know.

58:56.083 --> 58:58.125
I think so, too.

59:03.417 --> 59:04.626
Yes.

59:04.751 --> 59:06.542
Let's go, Nagatsuka-kun.

59:06.667 --> 59:08.876
Now is the time to go to the "Meow Meow Club"!

59:09.375 --> 59:11.417
Can I help you?

59:11.959 --> 59:13.542
How long are you going to stay?

59:13.918 --> 59:15.375
One hour, please.

59:16.292 --> 59:18.417
Can we use this coupon?

59:18.542 --> 59:21.000
Yes, you can.

59:21.292 --> 59:23.918
I can't believe it! He actually came...

59:25.209 --> 59:26.918
Well, I don't know how to say it...

59:28.918 --> 59:31.292
What did you expect?

59:31.417 --> 59:33.125
You're in the same boat.

59:33.292 --> 59:35.417
No no. Don't be stupid.

59:35.542 --> 59:39.083
I was simply interested in your old friend.

59:39.209 --> 59:41.292
Yes, your friend.

59:41.667 --> 59:43.083
Is she here?

59:43.292 --> 59:45.751
Actually, she's not a friend.

59:46.292 --> 59:47.375
Then what?

59:47.501 --> 59:49.918
It's a little complicated.

59:50.417 --> 59:52.417
Something happened during elementary school.

59:55.542 --> 59:56.902
She doesn't seem to be here today.

01:00:01.042 --> 01:00:02.751
Let's go home then.

01:00:11.209 --> 01:00:13.292
Oh, really...

01:00:17.334 --> 01:00:18.334
Insect!

01:00:19.417 --> 01:00:20.792
Hi, you came!

01:00:21.501 --> 01:00:23.626
I came to play with Maria.

01:00:24.042 --> 01:00:26.959
By the way, will Nishimiya be
pleased if I gave her this pouch?

01:00:27.083 --> 01:00:28.209
Huh?

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:30.626
A cat!

01:00:32.542 --> 01:00:34.125
Sis, I've got something for you!

01:00:49.501 --> 01:00:50.959
...Sis?

01:00:54.709 --> 01:00:56.667
I'll leave it here.

01:01:04.209 --> 01:01:05.209
What?

01:01:05.959 --> 01:01:06.959
U--Ueno...

01:01:07.042 --> 01:01:08.959
-san?

01:01:09.125 --> 01:01:10.209
Go, go!

01:01:10.459 --> 01:01:12.542
Wait, wait, what is it!?

01:01:12.667 --> 01:01:13.667
Long time no see!

01:01:13.751 --> 01:01:16.417
Yeah. Long time no see.

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:20.751
Huh?

01:01:22.125 --> 01:01:24.250
The girl over there is Nishimiya, isn't it?

01:01:25.417 --> 01:01:27.417
She seems still alone, ha ha.

01:01:27.959 --> 01:01:29.584
Poor kid!

01:01:30.834 --> 01:01:33.292
Ishida! It's been really a
long time since seeing you.

01:01:33.417 --> 01:01:34.918
Let's hang out together sometime.

01:01:35.042 --> 01:01:37.042
No thanks, I'm good.

01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:39.709
Ishida, you hate me, don't you?

01:01:39.834 --> 01:01:42.584
Not really.

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:45.501
Actually,

01:01:45.626 --> 01:01:48.459
I have been thinking

01:01:48.584 --> 01:01:50.250
I should have talked to you earlier.

01:01:50.751 --> 01:01:53.375
I'm sorry about what happened
back in elementary school.

01:01:55.709 --> 01:01:57.876
Ueno, please get off my bike.

01:02:03.501 --> 01:02:06.709
Why does she have the pouch of the
cat café I'm working in?

01:02:07.125 --> 01:02:09.542
Why? That's weird!

01:02:10.042 --> 01:02:11.542
I gave it to her.

01:02:11.667 --> 01:02:13.751
Oh... I see.

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:19.584
Good-bye.

01:02:19.834 --> 01:02:20.918
Bye.

01:02:25.167 --> 01:02:26.167
Ueno?

01:02:27.083 --> 01:02:30.584
Nishimiya-san, long time no see!
Are you doing well?

01:02:30.709 --> 01:02:31.709
H... hey!!

01:02:32.209 --> 01:02:34.083
Huh? Why are you wearing only one?

01:02:34.375 --> 01:02:36.417
Ueno! What are you doing!?

01:02:38.209 --> 01:02:40.959
Throwing it away, just like the old days.

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:48.918
Sorry, Nishimiya.

01:02:50.959 --> 01:02:53.959
Are you kidding, Ishida?

01:02:54.083 --> 01:02:55.959
Wait! Wait a moment!

01:02:56.083 --> 01:02:58.667
Are you two going out together?

01:02:59.167 --> 01:03:00.959
No, it's nothing like that.

01:03:01.083 --> 01:03:02.626
We're just friends.

01:03:02.751 --> 01:03:04.167
Friends?

01:03:04.292 --> 01:03:05.876
Don't make me laugh!

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.918
You are friends with the girl you bullied?

01:03:08.042 --> 01:03:09.292
Why?

01:03:09.417 --> 01:03:12.292
I don't follow you!

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.918
Oh, I understand now.
You feeling a sense of guilt?

01:03:17.083 --> 01:03:18.375
No.

01:03:18.542 --> 01:03:19.834
Ha ha.

01:03:20.375 --> 01:03:22.918
Ishida, you have became such a boring guy.

01:03:25.918 --> 01:03:29.667
Now you two are playing friends!

01:03:30.083 --> 01:03:32.626
Ha ha ha.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:34.709
Huh?

01:03:37.042 --> 01:03:38.667
"What were you two talking about"?

01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:40.375
N--Nothing special.

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:44.167
Well, I have to leave now.

01:03:45.375 --> 01:03:46.375
See you again.

01:04:08.167 --> 01:04:09.417
Yuju,

01:04:11.751 --> 01:04:12.834
I'z mornigg.

01:04:13.125 --> 01:04:15.334
I'm awake. You surprised me.

01:04:15.584 --> 01:04:16.959
Bregbazt, lez eed now.

01:04:17.083 --> 01:04:19.000
Wait, wait, before that...

01:04:19.501 --> 01:04:20.626
What's happened?

01:04:22.667 --> 01:04:24.083
Sis.

01:04:24.834 --> 01:04:27.501
Ponytail? Why?

01:04:27.626 --> 01:04:28.626
Oh.

01:04:29.209 --> 01:04:31.584
What a weird face!

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.918
I'll make sure Ishida sees her!

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.626
"So much carp. Shortage of
bread and feeding manpower."

01:04:41.649 --> 01:04:43.049
"You MUST come."

01:04:50.459 --> 01:04:51.459
Huh?

01:04:53.250 --> 01:04:54.250
Nishimiya...

01:04:54.876 --> 01:04:56.459
Ponytail!?

01:05:11.209 --> 01:05:13.709
Whea are yu goig, Ijida-gun?

01:05:14.209 --> 01:05:16.667
"Where are you going?"

01:05:18.334 --> 01:05:19.667
I'm going to the bread shop.

01:05:20.042 --> 01:05:22.626
Yuzuru asked me to buy bread to feed the carp.

01:05:23.209 --> 01:05:26.792
Yuju muzt habe id. Yuju only
wand do ead bi herzelb.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.417
Hey, Nishimiya!

01:05:28.542 --> 01:05:30.459
Ijida-gun, ju don'd need do go

01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:32.266
Wait, wait. Sign language! Sign language!

01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:36.417
Iz mai voize stranze?

01:05:36.542 --> 01:05:37.542
Yes.

01:05:39.834 --> 01:05:41.375
Oh, sorry.

01:05:41.501 --> 01:05:43.209
Oh...

01:05:43.626 --> 01:05:46.292
It's perfectly fine.

01:05:46.584 --> 01:05:49.626
W--well, I have to go now... the bread.

01:05:50.667 --> 01:05:52.000
I'll see you.

01:05:56.626 --> 01:05:57.667
Huh?

01:05:58.334 --> 01:05:59.334
Nishimiya?

01:06:07.751 --> 01:06:10.000
Huh? Is that for me?

01:06:10.501 --> 01:06:11.626
Thanks.

01:06:14.501 --> 01:06:15.667
Can I take a look?

01:06:18.292 --> 01:06:19.792
...What are these?

01:06:23.626 --> 01:06:24.834
...Thank you very much.

01:06:29.334 --> 01:06:30.751
...ige... oo...

01:06:31.501 --> 01:06:32.501
What?

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:34.375
About this?

01:06:36.209 --> 01:06:38.209
I... ige... moo...

01:06:44.209 --> 01:06:45.209
Huh?...

01:06:48.876 --> 01:06:51.167
I lige moo!

01:07:00.292 --> 01:07:01.626
Moon?

01:07:02.417 --> 01:07:03.417
Yes.

01:07:04.667 --> 01:07:05.876
It's beautiful.

01:07:11.918 --> 01:07:13.459
Ni... Nishimiya!?

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000
(From: Big friend Nagatsuka)

01:07:18.001 --> 01:07:19.999
"How about we go out and see a movie now?"

01:07:22.292 --> 01:07:23.542
Hey Nagatsuka-kun,

01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:25.834
Does this remind you of the moon?

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Huh? I cannot see this as a moon.

01:07:29.459 --> 01:07:30.751
Hummm.

01:07:30.959 --> 01:07:31.834
C--Candy?

01:07:31.959 --> 01:07:34.000
It's not candy.

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:37.375
Nishimiya gave them just now,

01:07:37.501 --> 01:07:39.209
but I'm not sure what these are for.

01:07:39.626 --> 01:07:41.375
Huh?

01:07:43.083 --> 01:07:44.083
Oh...

01:07:45.751 --> 01:07:47.292
What's the matter, sis?

01:07:50.209 --> 01:07:51.600
"I said I like you to Ishida-kun"

01:07:51.626 --> 01:07:52.876
Eh, really!?

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.602
"But he couldn't understand what I said."

01:07:57.626 --> 01:07:58.626
Huh...

01:08:05.042 --> 01:08:07.334
Wow, you have changed your hairstyle.

01:08:07.459 --> 01:08:10.042
Why the change? What happened?

01:08:10.167 --> 01:08:12.417
It matches you so much!

01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:17.167
Stop, stop it everyone.

01:08:17.375 --> 01:08:19.959
I was in a bit of rush this morning, that's all.

01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:22.751
But that looks great anyway.

01:08:22.876 --> 01:08:24.667
Hi, Kawai-san.

01:08:25.082 --> 01:08:26.917
Why you have changed your hairstyle?

01:08:27.167 --> 01:08:29.626
Hmmm...

01:08:29.876 --> 01:08:32.334
I didn't have any special reason to do it.

01:08:32.667 --> 01:08:33.667
I see.

01:08:33.751 --> 01:08:36.584
That's what girls do, you know?

01:08:36.959 --> 01:08:37.959
OK.

01:08:38.834 --> 01:08:40.334
What?

01:08:40.459 --> 01:08:42.501
By the way, Mashiba-kun

01:08:42.626 --> 01:08:45.876
said he wants to be friends with you.

01:08:46.459 --> 01:08:47.667
Huh?

01:08:54.709 --> 01:08:56.667
Why... why are you here today.

01:08:57.082 --> 01:08:59.250
I'm Sahara, nice to meet you.

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:00.959
Me too. I'm Mashiba.

01:09:01.082 --> 01:09:03.542
Hey! Stop doing that over my head!

01:09:03.667 --> 01:09:05.959
Miyo-chan, long time no see.

01:09:06.082 --> 01:09:08.125
By the way, where is Nishimiya today?

01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:09.876
Sis went home, she had a stomachache.

01:09:10.334 --> 01:09:11.167
Umm...

01:09:11.292 --> 01:09:13.751
I wonder if she is avoiding me...?

01:09:13.959 --> 01:09:14.959
Why do you think so?

01:09:15.125 --> 01:09:16.209
The other day,

01:09:16.334 --> 01:09:18.334
She was trying hard to tell me something,

01:09:18.459 --> 01:09:20.299
but I couldn't understand what she was saying.

01:09:20.334 --> 01:09:22.167
Huh, what did sis try to say?

01:09:23.042 --> 01:09:23.709
Moon

01:09:23.917 --> 01:09:24.584
Pff!

01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:28.125
I cannot even understand
the simple words she says.

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:30.792
I guess that would make her mad.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:33.250
If you want to know if
sis is avoiding you or not,

01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:35.095
why don't you invite her out for something?

01:09:35.459 --> 01:09:36.859
If she is angry, she will say "no".

01:09:36.917 --> 01:09:37.917
Oh,

01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:39.792
That's a good idea.

01:09:43.417 --> 01:09:44.716
(From: Ishida)
"We are planning to go to the amusement park,"

01:09:44.716 --> 01:09:46.716
"I was thinking maybe we can go together?"

01:10:01.626 --> 01:10:03.918
Hi all, let's start with that roller coaster!

01:10:04.042 --> 01:10:05.584
Follow me so that you don't lost!

01:10:06.167 --> 01:10:08.083
Hey, why is that girl leading us?

01:10:08.209 --> 01:10:09.334
I don't know.

01:10:09.584 --> 01:10:11.292
Ishida.

01:10:11.584 --> 01:10:13.000
Who's that girl?

01:10:13.417 --> 01:10:14.167
Oh!

01:10:14.292 --> 01:10:16.667
She seems a bit too familiar with sis.

01:10:17.292 --> 01:10:19.334
Ueno?... Why?

01:10:20.876 --> 01:10:22.501
Is she Shoko's friend?

01:10:22.667 --> 01:10:24.250
Y--yes.

01:10:24.375 --> 01:10:26.125
From when we were in elementary school.

01:10:26.501 --> 01:10:28.083
Hmmmm...

01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:34.209
Can I sit next to you, Sahara-san?

01:10:34.584 --> 01:10:35.709
Yeah, of course.

01:10:40.417 --> 01:10:42.459
Is everyone all ready?

01:10:42.751 --> 01:10:43.918
Yeah!!

01:10:44.334 --> 01:10:45.876
Then let's start.

01:10:48.167 --> 01:10:51.918
Sahara-san are you OK being with Ueno?

01:10:52.042 --> 01:10:53.042
Huh?

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:54.083
Yes.

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:56.859
I'm in the same class with her in high school.

01:10:57.667 --> 01:11:01.042
I'm learning a lot from her
taste and design for clothes.

01:11:03.042 --> 01:11:07.134
I had been scared to ride this
when I was in the elementary school.

01:11:07.375 --> 01:11:08.792
I was a coward at that time.

01:11:11.334 --> 01:11:14.292
But I changed my ways a bit.

01:11:15.667 --> 01:11:19.292
I decided to ride it before I
decide if it is scary or not.

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:24.000
Actually, I am still scared a bit.

01:11:25.125 --> 01:11:27.000
Here we go!

01:11:47.584 --> 01:11:49.626
Hey, are you OK?

01:11:50.125 --> 01:11:51.959
Your legs are so trembling, Sho-chan.

01:11:53.751 --> 01:11:55.667
"Are you OK?"

01:11:56.792 --> 01:11:57.834
Ha ha.

01:11:57.959 --> 01:12:00.876
It's fantastic that you can use sign language!

01:12:01.167 --> 01:12:03.667
You did your best to learn
sign language, Ishida-kun!

01:12:04.125 --> 01:12:05.250
Huh?

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.709
Hey, is this hand yours?

01:12:11.209 --> 01:12:13.083
You are so rude to my best friend Ya-sho!

01:12:13.209 --> 01:12:15.626
Huh? I simply want to be friends with him.

01:12:15.751 --> 01:12:17.417
No, don't act like a child!

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:19.792
Nagatsuka-kun is so funny!

01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:23.000
My permission is needed
when you speak to Ya-sho!

01:12:23.125 --> 01:12:25.501
Nagatsuka-kun, is your hair natural one?

01:12:25.626 --> 01:12:28.042
What!? Don't be silly!

01:12:28.209 --> 01:12:30.250
Hey! Stop touching my hair!

01:12:30.375 --> 01:12:31.375
Wait...

01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000
Mashiba-kun, go faster!

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.209
Go, go, Ya-sho, go!

01:12:36.542 --> 01:12:37.542
Wait...

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:40.375
Can I...?

01:12:40.501 --> 01:12:42.876
Am I allowed to have this much fun?

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:46.792
But it seems it...

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:47.709
Oops!

01:12:47.834 --> 01:12:49.501
What are you doing?!

01:12:49.792 --> 01:12:52.501
Can it be...

01:12:52.918 --> 01:12:54.417
Friends!

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:01.876
Ishida.

01:13:02.375 --> 01:13:04.375
I want to eat "takoyaki" ball snacks.

01:13:04.792 --> 01:13:06.000
Let go and buy it together.

01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:08.209
What!? Hey!

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.125
Here's the takoyaki. Thank you for buying.

01:13:12.876 --> 01:13:13.876
Thank you very much.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:15.209
Hey, Ueno,

01:13:15.626 --> 01:13:17.876
I don't want your kindness.

01:13:26.042 --> 01:13:28.501
Shi... Shimada...

01:13:32.042 --> 01:13:33.250
Hey!

01:13:33.792 --> 01:13:35.792
Wait, Ishida!

01:13:36.292 --> 01:13:37.334
Oh!

01:13:38.167 --> 01:13:40.000
Sorry, but I'll text you later.

01:13:41.959 --> 01:13:43.125
Ishida!

01:13:43.918 --> 01:13:45.167
Are you angry?

01:13:45.417 --> 01:13:46.542
No. I'm not angry.

01:13:47.459 --> 01:13:49.375
Angry -- No.

01:13:49.501 --> 01:13:50.501
I just thought

01:13:50.834 --> 01:13:52.709
if you two meet again,

01:13:52.834 --> 01:13:55.959
perhaps you could be friends again.

01:13:56.250 --> 01:13:59.834
Things might go well if you two met again.

01:14:00.292 --> 01:14:02.292
I don't want your kindness.

01:14:03.876 --> 01:14:05.000
Oops.

01:14:06.292 --> 01:14:07.542
Eh.

01:14:07.959 --> 01:14:10.542
I did the same things to them...

01:14:15.334 --> 01:14:17.626
You and me are alike, huh?

01:14:17.792 --> 01:14:18.792
No. we are not.

01:14:19.250 --> 01:14:20.459
We are alike.

01:14:20.834 --> 01:14:22.334
We are not.

01:14:26.083 --> 01:14:27.083
Well.

01:14:27.209 --> 01:14:30.542
If Nishimiya-san hadn't come,
we all would still be happy.

01:14:32.317 --> 01:14:33.892
Don't jump to conclusions.

01:14:33.918 --> 01:14:35.542
But it's true, isn't it?

01:14:36.125 --> 01:14:37.792
If it wasn't for her,

01:14:37.918 --> 01:14:40.959
I would not have quarreled with Sahara,

01:14:41.083 --> 01:14:44.600
and the friendship between Ishida and
Shimada would have not been broken.

01:14:45.083 --> 01:14:48.125
I want to go back to the
time when Nishimiya-san came.

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.709
As for things with Shimada,

01:14:50.083 --> 01:14:52.876
I simply did so intentionally.

01:14:54.042 --> 01:14:56.584
Ishida, do you hate me?

01:14:57.125 --> 01:14:58.375
Perhaps.

01:15:00.042 --> 01:15:02.375
Now I feel like riding the ferris wheel.

01:15:02.667 --> 01:15:04.709
I want to it ride with Nishimiya-san.

01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:06.083
H--hey!

01:15:06.626 --> 01:15:07.417
Huh?

01:15:07.626 --> 01:15:10.542
Nishimiya-san, let's ride
the ferris wheel together.

01:15:10.667 --> 01:15:12.083
Hey, Ueno!

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:14.709
Sis, take the camera with you.

01:15:15.250 --> 01:15:17.501
I'm going to ride the jet coaster again.

01:15:40.542 --> 01:15:43.000
Hello, Yuzuru-chan.

01:15:43.125 --> 01:15:44.876
Shoya is in his room.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:47.250
Hi.

01:15:47.292 --> 01:15:49.042
I got a highly confidential movie.

01:15:50.417 --> 01:15:51.792
Movie from the ferris wheel?

01:15:52.292 --> 01:15:53.292
Yes.

01:15:53.542 --> 01:15:55.334
Huh? What do you mean?

01:15:55.667 --> 01:15:57.209
Peeping cam.

01:16:02.167 --> 01:16:04.042
You know...

01:16:04.667 --> 01:16:06.125
I hate you.

01:16:10.250 --> 01:16:11.959
Let's not use it.

01:16:13.125 --> 01:16:15.792
I'll speak clearly so that you can understand

01:16:15.918 --> 01:16:18.792
and I'll listen to what you have to say.

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:22.125
During elementary school,

01:16:22.584 --> 01:16:26.250
I couldn't understand you.

01:16:26.459 --> 01:16:31.042
But, I think you didn't understand us, too.

01:16:31.626 --> 01:16:35.292
That's why you bothered me
with your weird notebook

01:16:35.417 --> 01:16:37.751
and always smiled insincerely.

01:16:37.876 --> 01:16:41.250
You always said sorry when something happened.

01:16:42.042 --> 01:16:45.250
So I tried something different.

01:16:45.375 --> 01:16:49.125
I ignored you and talked
about you behind your back.

01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:53.250
Those were my messages to
stop bothering us any more.

01:16:53.667 --> 01:16:54.751
But,

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:58.250
you still didn't understand and got back at us.

01:16:58.375 --> 01:17:00.459
By ratting us out to the teachers.

01:17:01.167 --> 01:17:04.167
As a result, Ishida lost his friends,

01:17:04.667 --> 01:17:08.292
You shattered a lot of precious things around us.

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:12.292
I... I'b zorry...

01:17:12.417 --> 01:17:15.709
Actually, I don't want you to apologize.

01:17:15.918 --> 01:17:18.334
Our view was very narrow minded during childhood,

01:17:18.459 --> 01:17:21.876
and we did our best within that limitations.

01:17:22.042 --> 01:17:26.626
But I don't wanna tell you we can be friends now.

01:17:26.918 --> 01:17:29.417
I still hate you, and

01:17:29.542 --> 01:17:31.501
You still hate me.

01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:35.667
But how about declaring a
truce between you and me?

01:17:35.876 --> 01:17:39.000
So let's shake hands, even
though we both hate each other.

01:17:39.501 --> 01:17:42.000
Zat'z nod gorregd...

01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:45.667
I hade myzelf...

01:17:47.334 --> 01:17:48.334
So what?

01:17:49.584 --> 01:17:51.250
What's that?

01:17:54.918 --> 01:17:56.667
Then?

01:17:57.125 --> 01:17:59.459
Are you saying "I'm sorry" again!?

01:17:59.876 --> 01:18:01.125
After all this time,

01:18:01.292 --> 01:18:04.918
you are shutting your mind when we talk,
just as you did five years ago.

01:18:11.792 --> 01:18:13.167
What do you think?

01:18:19.167 --> 01:18:20.626
I want Nishimiya

01:18:21.209 --> 01:18:24.042
to be able to like herself.

01:18:32.918 --> 01:18:34.834
Ueno--san, right?

01:18:34.959 --> 01:18:36.709
Yes. Ueno?

01:18:37.334 --> 01:18:40.417
Did Nishimiya-san have trouble with her?

01:18:40.584 --> 01:18:42.250
Why do you ask?

01:18:42.375 --> 01:18:46.167
Kawai-san said they shared
a past in elementary school.

01:18:47.501 --> 01:18:49.042
By the way, I was surprised

01:18:49.167 --> 01:18:51.834
Nishimiya-san was really unable to hear.

01:18:52.792 --> 01:18:53.584
Yes, she is.

01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:55.083
Oh, I get it now,

01:18:55.209 --> 01:18:58.167
she was bullied because of her disability.

01:18:59.792 --> 01:19:02.167
I cannot forgive

01:19:02.584 --> 01:19:03.709
that kind of bullying,

01:19:04.250 --> 01:19:05.959
What do you think, Ishida-kun?

01:19:06.751 --> 01:19:08.375
What do you mean!?

01:19:08.834 --> 01:19:11.501
You're accusing me of spreading
what you did in the past!?

01:19:11.626 --> 01:19:13.959
Hey, you're talking too loud...

01:19:16.042 --> 01:19:18.751
After all, Ishida-kun has not
changed at all from the past!

01:19:18.876 --> 01:19:19.542
What!?

01:19:19.667 --> 01:19:21.852
You have always said the cruelest
things since elementary school!

01:19:21.876 --> 01:19:23.042
What's the matter, Ya-sho?

01:19:23.167 --> 01:19:24.792
Calm down, Kawai-san.

01:19:25.209 --> 01:19:26.289
What are you talking about?

01:19:26.667 --> 01:19:28.834
Mashiba-kun!

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.959
Ishida-kun used to bully
a girl in the past.

01:19:34.459 --> 01:19:36.667
What are you saying, Kawai-san?

01:19:37.083 --> 01:19:38.209
Don't be silly...

01:19:38.334 --> 01:19:39.459
It's true.

01:19:40.292 --> 01:19:43.459
Kawai-san also said
bad things about others at that time...

01:19:44.042 --> 01:19:47.083
I never badmouthed Nishimiya-san!

01:19:47.209 --> 01:19:48.834
What!? Nishimiya-san!?

01:19:48.959 --> 01:19:49.751
Yes.

01:19:49.876 --> 01:19:52.709
Ishida-kun bullied Nishimiya-san.

01:19:54.918 --> 01:19:58.334
I asked him to please stop doing that,

01:19:59.209 --> 01:20:01.834
but he didn't listen to what I said.

01:20:02.375 --> 01:20:03.959
He scared me so much...

01:20:06.334 --> 01:20:07.083
Ya-sho?

01:20:07.209 --> 01:20:08.000
Oops...

01:20:08.125 --> 01:20:09.417
Are you OK?

01:20:09.542 --> 01:20:11.334
Sorry, Nagatsuka-kun...

01:20:11.459 --> 01:20:12.501
Ya-sho...

01:20:14.584 --> 01:20:15.792
Ya-sho!

01:20:44.459 --> 01:20:47.083
I hate myself...

01:20:58.626 --> 01:21:00.375
Hi, Ishida.

01:21:00.501 --> 01:21:01.501
Hi!

01:21:03.459 --> 01:21:04.918
What's wrong?

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.918
No, nothing special.

01:21:08.167 --> 01:21:09.709
Nothing...

01:21:09.876 --> 01:21:10.918
Huh?

01:21:11.834 --> 01:21:13.501
Hey, Ishida-kun, you are already here!

01:21:13.918 --> 01:21:15.959
I got your bag here!

01:21:16.209 --> 01:21:16.876
Hey.

01:21:17.042 --> 01:21:18.209
Nao-chan...

01:21:19.209 --> 01:21:20.876
...I asked her to come.

01:21:24.792 --> 01:21:26.872
I'm sorry what happened in
the classroom, Ishida-kun.

01:21:27.417 --> 01:21:28.501
But,

01:21:28.834 --> 01:21:32.042
I still think you were to blame.

01:21:32.959 --> 01:21:34.375
So,

01:21:34.626 --> 01:21:36.709
if Ishida-kun apologizes first,

01:21:36.834 --> 01:21:38.542
we can forgive him,

01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:40.250
Mashiba-kun said so, and...

01:21:40.375 --> 01:21:41.584
Stop it.

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:44.250
That's not the proper way.

01:21:44.417 --> 01:21:48.083
We have no right to blame
Ishida for what happened.

01:21:49.417 --> 01:21:50.751
"We"?

01:21:51.042 --> 01:21:52.501
That's not correct, Nao-chan.

01:21:52.626 --> 01:21:53.792
What's not?

01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:55.455
She's no different from me,

01:21:55.501 --> 01:21:59.167
Nao-chan actually bullied
Nishimiya-san too.

01:21:59.375 --> 01:22:01.667
You should not treat me like yourself.

01:22:02.834 --> 01:22:04.501
Nao-chan...

01:22:04.834 --> 01:22:06.125
Hmmm...

01:22:06.626 --> 01:22:08.209
You're right. We are different.

01:22:08.667 --> 01:22:10.292
Completely different from you.

01:22:10.417 --> 01:22:13.417
All you could do was watch and laugh
at her when she was being bullied.

01:22:14.125 --> 01:22:15.125
How cruel of you!

01:22:15.250 --> 01:22:17.000
Hey, Sahara, what do you think about this?

01:22:17.125 --> 01:22:18.918
Me!?

01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:22.167
Nao-chan also said so many
bad things to Sahara-san.

01:22:22.292 --> 01:22:24.459
I only said what was true!

01:22:25.792 --> 01:22:28.292
Hey, answer now, Sahara!

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.167
At that time...

01:22:31.626 --> 01:22:33.292
I... I was...

01:22:33.751 --> 01:22:35.501
I was scared of both of you.

01:22:35.626 --> 01:22:37.667
What!? Whose side are you on!?

01:22:37.834 --> 01:22:39.501
I'm not on either side!

01:22:39.626 --> 01:22:40.792
Stop it.

01:22:42.501 --> 01:22:45.501
Everything was all my fault.

01:22:47.167 --> 01:22:49.250
I hate that kind of logic.

01:22:50.167 --> 01:22:51.375
Stop it, Ueno.

01:22:52.209 --> 01:22:55.334
Don't jump to conclusions by yourself.

01:22:56.417 --> 01:22:57.959
Ishida-kun, don't talk like that...

01:22:58.083 --> 01:22:59.584
Stop it, Sahara.

01:22:59.709 --> 01:23:01.626
You ran away in the past and regret it now,

01:23:01.751 --> 01:23:03.334
as if you are saying, "I was a coward".

01:23:03.626 --> 01:23:05.334
What is wrong with you, Ishida-kun?

01:23:05.626 --> 01:23:08.083
Stop speaking, Kawai.

01:23:08.542 --> 01:23:11.417
You only liked yourself.

01:23:12.501 --> 01:23:13.501
Ya-sho,

01:23:13.626 --> 01:23:16.042
I'm always on your side...

01:23:16.334 --> 01:23:20.000
Don't say that. You really don't know me.

01:23:20.918 --> 01:23:23.125
That's enough! I'm going home!

01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:25.584
Ya-sho...

01:23:27.125 --> 01:23:30.709
It's all right. I don't mind at all.

01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:33.626
Sho-chan,

01:23:34.626 --> 01:23:35.918
See you again.

01:23:42.167 --> 01:23:43.834
I'm sorry, Ishida.

01:23:45.042 --> 01:23:47.584
I shouldn't have come here.

01:23:50.501 --> 01:23:53.125
Ishida-kun, you were really bad.

01:23:54.876 --> 01:23:57.250
Don't talk to me, you outsider.

01:23:58.918 --> 01:24:01.042
I thought we were friends.

01:24:13.375 --> 01:24:14.542
Oh, by the way,

01:24:15.751 --> 01:24:17.167
Next week,

01:24:17.834 --> 01:24:19.542
the summer holidays will start.

01:24:20.083 --> 01:24:22.250
Why don't we go somewhere fun together?

01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:43.083
Yuzu.

01:24:43.501 --> 01:24:46.918
You'll hurt your eyes reading
something in such a dark place.

01:24:52.626 --> 01:24:53.792
Here.

01:25:00.542 --> 01:25:04.000
Yuzu, are you still worried about sis?

01:25:06.751 --> 01:25:09.751
Gramma worries about you, Yuzuru.

01:25:09.918 --> 01:25:11.709
You always care about your sis,

01:25:11.834 --> 01:25:15.667
and don't take care about yourself.

01:25:16.334 --> 01:25:18.125
You do the same thing, gramma!

01:25:18.626 --> 01:25:22.834
You don't join senior people groups
and study sign language all the time.

01:25:23.125 --> 01:25:26.667
That's just what I want to do.

01:25:27.167 --> 01:25:30.542
Then so do I. I also do
what I want to do myself.

01:25:32.042 --> 01:25:33.209
Really?

01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:38.918
You are a very good granddaughter, Yuzu.

01:25:39.209 --> 01:25:40.209
I don't think so.

01:25:40.584 --> 01:25:43.334
I'm scolded everyday by mom,

01:25:43.459 --> 01:25:45.334
and I have not gone to school for a while.

01:25:45.918 --> 01:25:48.167
You have a very kind heart.

01:25:49.125 --> 01:25:50.876
Shoko is also trying her best everyday.

01:25:53.292 --> 01:25:57.375
I'm very proud of having
two very good granddaughters.

01:26:00.834 --> 01:26:02.667
How about a sweet manju?

01:26:02.792 --> 01:26:03.876
Yes, of course!

01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:19.709
Grandma???

01:26:32.501 --> 01:26:34.375
Hi Nishimiya.

01:26:34.834 --> 01:26:39.751
I got some very fresh bread today.

01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.709
This bread is

01:26:43.709 --> 01:26:46.792
as wonderful as you,

01:26:46.918 --> 01:26:48.417
so...

01:26:49.584 --> 01:26:51.042
What am I saying today?

01:26:51.792 --> 01:26:52.792
Huh...?

01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:56.709
Nishimiya didn't come today?

01:26:59.626 --> 01:27:00.751
Well...

01:27:01.292 --> 01:27:03.876
"Hi, Nishimiya, do you have
a stomachache today too?"

01:27:04.459 --> 01:27:05.667
Nah, that sounds weird.

01:27:15.375 --> 01:27:17.751
Hey, Yuzu???

01:27:31.459 --> 01:27:32.477
I guess I'll go home now...

01:27:32.501 --> 01:27:33.542
Ishida!

01:27:33.918 --> 01:27:35.125
Hey!

01:27:35.876 --> 01:27:37.083
What are you wearing?

01:27:37.209 --> 01:27:39.292
What? This is my school uniform.

01:27:39.417 --> 01:27:40.918
What do you think?!

01:27:41.042 --> 01:27:42.042
About what?

01:27:42.125 --> 01:27:44.459
About school.

01:27:44.751 --> 01:27:46.792
But it's summer vacation now.

01:27:46.918 --> 01:27:47.918
Ehh...

01:27:49.417 --> 01:27:51.083
Really, what's wrong with you today?

01:27:53.417 --> 01:27:54.959
Nothing.

01:27:55.083 --> 01:27:57.083
Can I ask something... Is it a kind of cosplay!?

01:27:57.209 --> 01:27:59.292
Huh.

01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:03.375
It's a text from my sis. I have to go.

01:28:03.501 --> 01:28:04.876
I'll take you. Where?

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.125
No, I'm good.

01:28:06.501 --> 01:28:07.501
I will.

01:28:07.626 --> 01:28:09.334
I'm really fine.

01:28:09.834 --> 01:28:11.417
But you were crying just now.

01:28:12.417 --> 01:28:13.501
Why?

01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:18.209
It's got nothing to do with you, Ishida.

01:28:19.667 --> 01:28:21.083
Yes it does...

01:28:21.751 --> 01:28:23.083
At least, I want to think so.

01:28:23.209 --> 01:28:24.459
Why?

01:28:24.876 --> 01:28:26.375
I worry about Yuzuru.

01:28:28.501 --> 01:28:30.959
Don't say what my grandma would say.

01:28:33.667 --> 01:28:35.542
Then I don't care if you follow me.

01:28:39.209 --> 01:28:40.959
Thank you Ishida.

01:28:41.250 --> 01:28:44.125
This is far enough.

01:28:44.802 --> 01:28:46.810
<i>"Funeral service for Ito Nishimiya"</i>

01:28:46.834 --> 01:28:48.000
Bye.

01:28:53.876 --> 01:28:55.751
Hang in there, Yuzuru!

01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:00.250
Ishida.

01:29:04.209 --> 01:29:05.792
I'm still scared a bit.

01:30:05.626 --> 01:30:08.975
(To: Nishimiya) How about
hanging out somewhere tomorrow?

01:31:01.334 --> 01:31:03.125
Oh, it's beautiful!

01:31:05.876 --> 01:31:07.667
C'mon, Nishimiya. Let's keep going.

01:31:10.501 --> 01:31:11.709
Huh?

01:31:17.417 --> 01:31:18.667
Nishimiya?

01:31:18.792 --> 01:31:19.792
Oops!

01:31:26.209 --> 01:31:28.501
Ha ha... I'm a bit scared.

01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:32.501
What? Why did you say sorry now?

01:31:39.292 --> 01:31:41.000
I didn't say such a ridiculous thing!

01:31:41.125 --> 01:31:42.792
Hey, Nishimiya, how about tomorrow?

01:31:43.375 --> 01:31:44.518
Let's hang out tomorrow, too!

01:31:44.542 --> 01:31:46.459
OK? Nishimiya.

01:31:50.125 --> 01:31:51.501
Nishimiya said that

01:31:51.626 --> 01:31:55.083
I will be unhappy as long
as I am together with her.

01:31:56.834 --> 01:31:59.292
The person who made Nishimiya unhappy

01:31:59.792 --> 01:32:01.334
was me...

01:32:09.667 --> 01:32:14.125
I want to see the ocean,

01:32:15.042 --> 01:32:19.542
I want to fall in love,

01:32:20.584 --> 01:32:24.292
even a monster has

01:32:24.751 --> 01:32:29.042
a heart...

01:32:29.459 --> 01:32:30.459
Sigh...

01:32:30.667 --> 01:32:33.167
I don't know what to do next...

01:32:37.542 --> 01:32:40.667
Nishimiya! Yuzuru, too!

01:32:40.834 --> 01:32:42.709
Then let's go to see a movie!

01:32:42.834 --> 01:32:45.584
Ha ha ha, That was really funny!

01:32:46.083 --> 01:32:48.083
Hey, here I am!

01:32:48.542 --> 01:32:51.751
What a great summer we had this year!

01:32:51.876 --> 01:32:52.894
You agree on that, Yuzuru?

01:32:52.918 --> 01:32:53.751
I don't know...

01:32:53.876 --> 01:32:56.459
It's really full of happy times.

01:32:56.584 --> 01:32:57.709
Hey, Nishimiya,

01:32:57.834 --> 01:32:59.459
How about tomorrow?

01:32:59.584 --> 01:33:01.125
Let's go out somewhere tomorrow, too!

01:33:01.375 --> 01:33:04.167
We cannot go tomorrow, we have something to do.

01:33:04.459 --> 01:33:05.459
What?

01:33:06.876 --> 01:33:09.000
Really!? Are you serious!?

01:33:09.125 --> 01:33:10.125
What are you going to do?

01:33:10.334 --> 01:33:11.375
I---is this OK?

01:33:11.876 --> 01:33:13.876
Is it OK for me to be here?

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:16.000
Now that Ishida is assigned to help us

01:33:16.125 --> 01:33:18.667
to make a birthday cake for our mother.

01:33:18.792 --> 01:33:19.792
Really?

01:33:19.834 --> 01:33:21.417
I---is that OK?

01:33:21.542 --> 01:33:23.250
Your mom will slap me again, won't she?

01:33:23.375 --> 01:33:25.918
It might be even more than that.
She might even kill you.

01:33:26.042 --> 01:33:27.250
Hey!

01:33:27.751 --> 01:33:30.000
Oh, it looks delicious!

01:33:32.667 --> 01:33:35.042
What? Why is this guy here?

01:33:35.167 --> 01:33:37.167
Shoko, what do you intend to do?

01:33:37.334 --> 01:33:39.417
Get out now...

01:33:39.542 --> 01:33:42.209
Stop, mother! Today is your birthday!

01:33:42.334 --> 01:33:43.501
Yuzuru.

01:33:43.667 --> 01:33:44.751
You look good with this!

01:33:45.876 --> 01:33:46.876
Eh...

01:33:52.125 --> 01:33:53.375
This tastes good!

01:33:53.834 --> 01:33:56.459
It was good that you didn't get killed, Ishida.

01:33:56.792 --> 01:33:57.918
Y--Yes.

01:33:58.042 --> 01:33:59.792
Good job, sis!

01:33:59.959 --> 01:34:01.667
By the way, Yuzuru.

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.501
I submitted some of your photos
to the prefectural photo contest.

01:34:05.626 --> 01:34:07.083
What?

01:34:07.209 --> 01:34:09.292
Sho-chan wanted me to submit them for you.

01:34:12.876 --> 01:34:15.751
But aren't all the photos kind of creepy.

01:34:15.876 --> 01:34:17.667
Not necessarily.

01:34:18.542 --> 01:34:20.226
Hey, why did you two do it without asking me!

01:34:20.250 --> 01:34:21.250
Pff...

01:34:22.042 --> 01:34:25.959
By the way, there will be a
fireworks festival next Tuesday.

01:34:28.542 --> 01:34:29.876
Hmm, I'd like to pass.

01:34:30.042 --> 01:34:31.876
Let's go together.

01:34:44.584 --> 01:34:46.667
Is it OK here? Yes, yes.

01:35:15.626 --> 01:35:18.375
Well, I'm going to buy some fried noodles.

01:35:18.542 --> 01:35:19.709
Let's go together.

01:35:31.834 --> 01:35:33.083
Oh thank you.

01:35:33.501 --> 01:35:37.459
Well, thank you for inviting me
to your house the other day.

01:35:37.584 --> 01:35:38.626
Your mom...

01:35:38.792 --> 01:35:39.792
Yes.

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:41.834
Did she enjoy the party?

01:35:41.959 --> 01:35:43.709
Basically she had no expressions, but...

01:35:44.459 --> 01:35:48.042
When is your birthday, Nishimiya?

01:35:49.792 --> 01:35:50.876
June

01:35:51.042 --> 01:35:52.042
7th.

01:35:52.125 --> 01:35:54.375
Oh, it has already passed!

01:35:54.501 --> 01:35:55.501
Well...

01:35:55.626 --> 01:35:58.334
You are 18 years old already.

01:35:58.667 --> 01:36:02.584
Next year, let's celebrate
your birthday together.

01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:03.542
Oops,

01:36:03.667 --> 01:36:05.334
I said "together" unintentionally.

01:36:08.959 --> 01:36:09.959
Oh.

01:36:28.584 --> 01:36:30.834
I see.

01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.292
I get it!

01:36:32.667 --> 01:36:35.042
It's interesting.

01:36:36.834 --> 01:36:39.000
Oh, where are you going?

01:36:42.918 --> 01:36:46.792
But the fireworks are not over yet?

01:36:49.417 --> 01:36:50.792
"Study"...

01:36:51.792 --> 01:36:52.959
I see.

01:36:53.417 --> 01:36:55.792
Then I'll go with you.

01:36:57.167 --> 01:36:58.501
But...

01:37:04.542 --> 01:37:05.542
I see.

01:37:05.667 --> 01:37:07.292
See you again.

01:37:17.626 --> 01:37:20.584
What? What happened to sis?

01:37:21.417 --> 01:37:22.918
Ishida,

01:37:23.042 --> 01:37:25.167
can you go to our apartment to pick up my camera?

01:37:38.834 --> 01:37:41.042
Good evening...

01:37:41.167 --> 01:37:42.459
Oh, it's dark.

01:37:42.792 --> 01:37:45.876
Nishimiya, I'm here!

01:37:46.542 --> 01:37:48.209
Here it is.

01:37:48.584 --> 01:37:51.709
I wonder if it's charged...?

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.250
Huh? Oh, we can see the fireworks from here.

01:37:55.792 --> 01:37:58.209
Nishimiya...

01:37:58.375 --> 01:38:00.751
Hi, Nishimi... ya...

01:38:01.751 --> 01:38:02.751
Nishimiya?

01:38:03.459 --> 01:38:05.167
Wait, wait! Wait a minute!

01:38:05.918 --> 01:38:06.918
What are you doing?!

01:38:07.042 --> 01:38:08.042
Nishimiya?

01:38:12.083 --> 01:38:13.083
Nishimiya...!?

01:38:15.542 --> 01:38:16.542
Huh!

01:38:25.042 --> 01:38:25.834
Nishimiya!

01:38:25.959 --> 01:38:26.959
Ouch!

01:38:32.792 --> 01:38:33.959
Nishimiya!

01:38:36.417 --> 01:38:37.876
Shoko!

01:39:01.792 --> 01:39:02.918
Why...

01:39:03.250 --> 01:39:04.792
Why, Nishimiya...

01:39:09.834 --> 01:39:10.834
Nishimiya, railing!

01:39:10.959 --> 01:39:12.959
Grab the railing!

01:39:13.125 --> 01:39:14.584
Please, God...

01:39:15.292 --> 01:39:19.042
Give me just one more ounce of strength.

01:39:20.167 --> 01:39:22.834
I won't run from my challenges im my life.

01:39:23.876 --> 01:39:25.167
From tomorrow,

01:39:25.667 --> 01:39:28.501
I'll look at everyone's face.

01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:32.459
I'll listen to everyone's voice from tomorrow.

01:39:33.626 --> 01:39:36.626
I'll do everything properly from tomorrow...

01:39:37.542 --> 01:39:39.626
Ni... Nishimiya...

01:39:41.542 --> 01:39:44.626
Ah, the scar I made back then...

01:39:45.751 --> 01:39:48.209
Did I properly apologize for that?

01:39:49.292 --> 01:39:50.375
Sorry.

01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:52.792
Sorry, Nishimiya.

01:39:53.042 --> 01:39:54.626
Are you still mad?

01:39:55.042 --> 01:39:57.375
Crap...

01:39:58.042 --> 01:39:59.334
I should have asked Nishimiya

01:39:59.459 --> 01:40:02.834
what she really thinks of me...

01:40:03.876 --> 01:40:07.000
By the way, you know, I---

01:40:20.125 --> 01:40:21.209
Sho-chan,

01:40:21.334 --> 01:40:24.250
Sis made pancakes for you.

01:40:24.792 --> 01:40:26.876
Maria will go out to see the fireworks!

01:40:39.375 --> 01:40:40.834
It's cold...

01:40:41.667 --> 01:40:43.250
and warm...

01:41:09.209 --> 01:41:10.375
Hi, ma'am.

01:41:10.918 --> 01:41:12.834
Hi, Yuzuru-chan...

01:41:13.542 --> 01:41:14.918
I finally found you.

01:41:15.250 --> 01:41:17.459
No one answered when I called the salon,

01:41:17.584 --> 01:41:19.626
and entering the room was prohibited...

01:41:19.918 --> 01:41:22.626
Oh, it's OK now.

01:41:22.792 --> 01:41:24.626
He changed rooms today.

01:41:25.125 --> 01:41:28.250
Let's go to the room together and see him.

01:41:28.626 --> 01:41:30.209
Ma'am, well Shoko...

01:41:30.334 --> 01:41:31.542
Ishida-san.

01:41:32.375 --> 01:41:33.375
Nishimiya-san...

01:41:35.167 --> 01:41:37.667
Nishimiya-san... I'm very sorry.

01:41:38.042 --> 01:41:41.250
Sorry again for troubling you like this.

01:41:42.334 --> 01:41:43.751
I am very sorry.

01:41:43.876 --> 01:41:44.876
Oh, please stop this.

01:41:45.542 --> 01:41:48.542
My son must have done
something wrong to Shoko-san.

01:41:48.667 --> 01:41:50.375
Ma'am.

01:41:50.501 --> 01:41:53.959
Ishida saved my stupid sister.

01:41:54.417 --> 01:41:56.667
I take full responsibility for this.

01:41:57.292 --> 01:41:59.709
I'm sorry.

01:42:01.667 --> 01:42:02.667
Please.

01:42:03.876 --> 01:42:06.042
Please raise your heads.

01:42:06.209 --> 01:42:08.876
It is important that
Shoko-san is OK. Isn't it?

01:42:09.209 --> 01:42:11.459
So are you, Yuzuru-chan.

01:42:12.417 --> 01:42:14.375
Please...

01:42:15.375 --> 01:42:18.542
<i>"Why in the world did
Ishida have to be injured!"</i>

01:42:19.584 --> 01:42:21.751
Don't pretend to be the tragic heroine!

01:42:23.042 --> 01:42:24.667
Say something!

01:42:25.083 --> 01:42:29.417
"I made a lot of trouble and bothered everyone,"

01:42:29.584 --> 01:42:31.709
"so I'll apologize by killing myself."

01:42:31.834 --> 01:42:33.834
"I am very sorry??"

01:42:34.292 --> 01:42:36.459
You've got some nerve!

01:42:36.626 --> 01:42:37.626
Hey, Nishimiya.

01:42:37.792 --> 01:42:39.709
You are a real pain!

01:42:40.167 --> 01:42:42.459
You, a person who thinks all the time

01:42:42.584 --> 01:42:44.584
and keeps it all in their head without speaking,

01:42:44.709 --> 01:42:46.375
is extremely irritating!

01:42:51.209 --> 01:42:52.334
Ouch!

01:42:52.459 --> 01:42:53.834
Who are you!

01:42:57.626 --> 01:43:00.167
Oh, you must be Nishimiya's mother...

01:43:00.542 --> 01:43:02.667
If you cannot raise your child,

01:43:02.792 --> 01:43:04.632
you shouldn't have had her in the first place!

01:43:04.751 --> 01:43:05.751
What are you doing?!

01:43:07.501 --> 01:43:08.792
Stop it!

01:43:11.334 --> 01:43:12.542
Stop it!

01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.000
Why?

01:43:14.834 --> 01:43:16.042
What are you doing!?

01:43:28.292 --> 01:43:30.083
...Are you Shoko-san?

01:43:33.292 --> 01:43:35.542
Zorry.

01:43:36.792 --> 01:43:38.209
I... I'b zorry.

01:43:40.250 --> 01:43:42.417
I'b zorry.

01:43:45.584 --> 01:43:47.626
I'b zorry!

01:43:51.834 --> 01:43:54.417
I'b zorry!!

01:44:07.584 --> 01:44:09.125
What are you doing?

01:44:10.167 --> 01:44:11.327
I thought seeing these photos

01:44:11.876 --> 01:44:15.125
would change sis's mind about wanting to die...

01:44:19.751 --> 01:44:22.125
What should I have done?

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.584
Crap, it can't be opened.

01:45:11.751 --> 01:45:13.125
She's holding it shut!

01:45:13.501 --> 01:45:15.876
Oh, Nishimiya-san?

01:45:16.042 --> 01:45:19.125
How about going to the lobby?
I'll buy you a drink.

01:45:19.301 --> 01:45:20.500
(Hospital rooms #400-417)

01:45:20.501 --> 01:45:23.000
I heard what happened between you
and Ya-sho.

01:45:25.417 --> 01:45:27.826
"I destroyed what Ishida-kun
created working so hard."

01:45:28.751 --> 01:45:31.042
Do you mean what happened at the bridge?

01:45:32.375 --> 01:45:36.334
Actually, Ya-sho accepted
a nobody like me.

01:45:36.834 --> 01:45:39.584
At that moment I learned what real friends are,

01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:41.375
for the first time.

01:45:45.959 --> 01:45:48.792
Ya-sho is my "big friend",

01:45:48.918 --> 01:45:51.334
so I am totally at a loss
until he wakes up again.

01:45:59.417 --> 01:46:03.017
"I want to fix what I destroyed."

01:46:04.626 --> 01:46:05.626
Oh...

01:46:08.792 --> 01:46:11.542
It's silly you tried to kill yourself.
Even you were hurt!

01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:14.250
You are speaking too loud, Kawai-san...

01:46:14.375 --> 01:46:18.334
Nishimiya-san can't hear
unless we speak loudly!

01:46:20.501 --> 01:46:23.042
Everyone was worried about you.

01:46:23.250 --> 01:46:26.542
Everybody has had hard experiences in life.

01:46:27.125 --> 01:46:29.250
Everyone has, don't you think so?

01:46:29.417 --> 01:46:30.584
So,

01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.960
we have to keep moving forward, loving ourselves,

01:46:33.209 --> 01:46:36.000
as a whole including our weaknesses.

01:46:39.918 --> 01:46:41.584
I am relieved to know you are OK now.

01:46:45.125 --> 01:46:46.125
I see,

01:46:46.375 --> 01:46:48.792
you are going around to meet
everyone who were at the bridge.

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:50.417
You are strong...

01:46:52.584 --> 01:46:55.250
Honestly, I'm scared.

01:46:55.918 --> 01:46:59.083
Even when Ishida-kun wakes up,

01:46:59.209 --> 01:47:02.501
I don't have the courage to see him again.

01:47:02.834 --> 01:47:05.584
I couldn't change myself.

01:47:06.125 --> 01:47:08.292
I ran away again and failed to save you again.

01:47:08.626 --> 01:47:10.083
I'm still a coward.

01:47:11.918 --> 01:47:14.292
Yu bill jange brom now on,

01:47:16.209 --> 01:47:17.709
Zaara-zan...

01:47:20.918 --> 01:47:23.918
Thank you for coming to meet me, Sho-chan.

01:48:05.792 --> 01:48:09.000
Hey, stop it!

01:48:18.292 --> 01:48:19.292
Nishimiya.

01:48:20.417 --> 01:48:21.417
I found you...

01:48:23.167 --> 01:48:24.717
Are you doing well?

01:48:27.250 --> 01:48:28.250
Somewhat

01:48:28.918 --> 01:48:29.918
strange, isn't it?

01:48:31.959 --> 01:48:32.959
I think

01:48:33.375 --> 01:48:34.501
I am going to die.

01:48:35.667 --> 01:48:36.667
Oh...

01:48:37.501 --> 01:48:38.501
Tuesday is almost over.

01:48:41.014 --> 01:48:42.014
Farewell,

01:48:43.045 --> 01:48:44.045
Nishimiya...

01:49:46.459 --> 01:49:48.375
No! Nishimiya!

01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:52.834
What's this?

01:49:53.542 --> 01:49:54.626
Hey mom!

01:49:54.751 --> 01:49:55.792
This...

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.167
Get rid of this!

01:50:04.626 --> 01:50:06.417
Nishimiya!

01:50:09.083 --> 01:50:10.125
Nishimiya!

01:50:19.167 --> 01:50:20.167
Nishimiya!

01:50:21.042 --> 01:50:23.459
Nishimiya!

01:50:25.042 --> 01:50:26.125
Nishimiya!

01:50:41.083 --> 01:50:42.083
Yo!

01:51:10.292 --> 01:51:11.375
Ha.

01:51:12.584 --> 01:51:13.584
Pff!

01:51:15.834 --> 01:51:18.459
Aha ha ha.

01:51:19.292 --> 01:51:20.417
Well...

01:51:24.626 --> 01:51:26.000
Are you all right?

01:51:32.667 --> 01:51:33.667
Yes.

01:51:34.709 --> 01:51:35.959
I'm glad to know

01:51:37.167 --> 01:51:38.375
you are OK.

01:51:42.542 --> 01:51:43.542
Nishimiya...

01:51:43.918 --> 01:51:46.959
I'm OK now too

01:51:48.209 --> 01:51:49.626
...more or less.

01:51:51.584 --> 01:51:55.125
Please don't make such a serious face.

01:51:55.584 --> 01:51:56.751
And, let me say...

01:52:00.042 --> 01:52:01.334
Nishimiya-san.

01:52:03.292 --> 01:52:04.709
I am sorry.

01:52:05.501 --> 01:52:10.292
I never really apologized for
what I did to you in the past.

01:52:11.167 --> 01:52:14.417
In addition, for what I did after we met again.

01:52:14.709 --> 01:52:16.125
So many things.

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.167
Perhaps,

01:52:19.417 --> 01:52:21.209
I used you

01:52:21.334 --> 01:52:24.751
to suit my needs.

01:52:25.417 --> 01:52:26.417
Actually, I want to

01:52:26.918 --> 01:52:29.167
talk more

01:52:29.334 --> 01:52:30.626
with you.

01:52:32.209 --> 01:52:34.584
Perhaps that's all.

01:52:35.292 --> 01:52:39.000
But my selfish behavior had hurt you,

01:52:39.834 --> 01:52:43.584
and forced you to choose the wrong path

01:52:45.125 --> 01:52:46.125
Noooo, Zat'z nod gorregd.

01:52:46.501 --> 01:52:49.000
Begauze I had nod jenged,

01:52:49.292 --> 01:52:50.959
ju falld.

01:52:51.626 --> 01:52:53.083
I ab

01:52:53.417 --> 01:52:56.501
dodally blamed.

01:52:57.083 --> 01:53:00.292
Everizing would go vell

01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:02.459
Ib I vend away...

01:53:03.501 --> 01:53:06.292
I'b zorry...

01:53:06.417 --> 01:53:08.459
Don't cry, Nishimiya.

01:53:12.542 --> 01:53:15.042
Well, Nishimiya.

01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:21.542
Earlier,

01:53:21.667 --> 01:53:23.501
I talked to you in my dreams.

01:53:24.584 --> 01:53:25.918
In the dream,

01:53:26.542 --> 01:53:30.083
I had tried to give up many things in my life.

01:53:31.334 --> 01:53:33.792
But I realized it wasn't the right thing to do.

01:53:34.375 --> 01:53:38.959
I thought the same way as you.

01:53:39.834 --> 01:53:40.959
But then,

01:53:41.709 --> 01:53:42.959
I realized,

01:53:43.417 --> 01:53:47.209
that it still wasn't worth dying.

01:53:49.083 --> 01:53:52.626
I want to apologize to the others, too.

01:53:55.125 --> 01:53:57.751
So, Nishimiya...

01:53:57.876 --> 01:53:58.876
I want

01:54:02.459 --> 01:54:03.584
you to

01:54:04.709 --> 01:54:06.000
help me

01:54:06.834 --> 01:54:08.209
live.

01:54:17.209 --> 01:54:18.667
Nishimiya.

01:54:39.959 --> 01:54:41.209
Wow!

01:54:41.334 --> 01:54:44.292
What did I just do!

01:54:44.542 --> 01:54:45.626
Damn!

01:54:45.792 --> 01:54:47.918
Sorry, but forget what I just did, Nishimiya!

01:54:48.042 --> 01:54:49.876
Forget what I just said now!

01:55:13.250 --> 01:55:15.542
Hey, customer! You've arrived!

01:55:17.959 --> 01:55:21.250
Hey, Maria, are you watering the flowers?

01:55:21.375 --> 01:55:22.959
You are a good girl!

01:55:25.459 --> 01:55:27.876
You die? die? dieeeeeee?

01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.334
Maria, Sho-chan was brought back to life.

01:55:31.459 --> 01:55:33.417
I'm not dead, Maria.

01:55:33.542 --> 01:55:34.292
Huh?

01:55:34.417 --> 01:55:35.918
Is that Ueno-san?

01:55:37.501 --> 01:55:40.792
She took care of you when you were asleep.

01:55:41.250 --> 01:55:43.000
You should thank her.

01:55:45.542 --> 01:55:47.292
I heard you took care of me.

01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:50.834
I'm really a good-for-nothing person...

01:55:51.834 --> 01:55:54.042
Even now, I am more or less,

01:55:54.167 --> 01:55:58.334
unable to like Nishimiya-san.

01:55:59.417 --> 01:56:01.497
Huh, maybe it's best not
to force to change myself...

01:56:01.834 --> 01:56:03.959
And, it was Shimada and Hirose,

01:56:04.083 --> 01:56:07.209
who saved you when you fell into the river.

01:56:08.083 --> 01:56:10.375
They asked me not to tell you,
but I wanted to tell you.

01:56:11.167 --> 01:56:12.167
Ishida.

01:56:13.375 --> 01:56:14.709
Welcome back!

01:56:15.167 --> 01:56:17.125
Then I'll be going home.

01:56:18.459 --> 01:56:19.751
Thank you.

01:56:29.083 --> 01:56:31.167
Oh, it's too short, isn't it!?

01:56:31.501 --> 01:56:34.042
No, no, you will be so cute with short hair!

01:56:34.209 --> 01:56:35.751
Hi, welcome back, Sho-chan.

01:56:35.876 --> 01:56:36.876
Huh, h... hello.

01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.792
Hi, welcome to the salon...

01:56:40.959 --> 01:56:42.417
Ishida-kun.

01:56:43.542 --> 01:56:44.894
I'm sorry for everything that happened.

01:56:44.918 --> 01:56:47.167
No, I'm sorry too.

01:56:47.375 --> 01:56:49.417
That's right. My son is immortal.

01:56:49.584 --> 01:56:52.334
Hi mom, I'll go and pick Maria up.

01:56:52.542 --> 01:56:53.876
What!? Who is that guy?

01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:56.501
My daughter's husband.
He came back from Brazil.

01:56:57.167 --> 01:57:00.000
And Sho-chan. Yuzu-chan is in your room.

01:57:00.459 --> 01:57:02.542
Take some desserts from the refrigerator to her.

01:57:02.667 --> 01:57:04.042
Hey.

01:57:04.334 --> 01:57:05.417
Hi.

01:57:05.792 --> 01:57:07.792
Is that the winter-season
uniform? That suits you.

01:57:07.918 --> 01:57:09.375
By the way, take a look at this.

01:57:09.667 --> 01:57:12.375
Oh, my. Great!

01:57:12.501 --> 01:57:13.834
And take another look at this.

01:57:14.083 --> 01:57:16.542
Oh, my...

01:57:16.792 --> 01:57:18.042
Have mercy, kind sir!

01:57:18.167 --> 01:57:20.250
You must help me!

01:57:20.501 --> 01:57:21.709
Sure. Of course I will.

01:57:25.584 --> 01:57:28.125
You have started going back
to school again, haven't you?

01:57:28.334 --> 01:57:30.918
Yes. Shoko gave me a
good reason to go back.

01:57:32.751 --> 01:57:35.501
Well, I will do my best.

01:57:35.918 --> 01:57:37.667
I wanna meet her expectations.

01:57:40.125 --> 01:57:42.125
By the way, isn't there
a school festival tomorrow?

01:57:42.501 --> 01:57:44.042
Yes.

01:57:49.501 --> 01:57:50.000
Shoko Nishimiya: "Hello"

01:57:50.001 --> 01:57:51.199
"Everyone said they are going
to the school festival tomorrow."

01:57:51.200 --> 01:57:53.143
"I will meet you at the front
gate at 10:00, is that OK?"

01:57:53.167 --> 01:57:54.918
Good morning, everyone!

01:57:55.292 --> 01:57:56.584
Are you all OK?

01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:01.209
I'm sorry for what I said at the bridge!

01:58:09.375 --> 01:58:10.375
It's time to go!

01:58:10.542 --> 01:58:11.542
I'm going to school!

01:58:11.667 --> 01:58:12.667
Bye! Cheer up!

01:58:13.125 --> 01:58:14.667
Oh!

01:58:14.792 --> 01:58:16.584
Is that what they are used for?

01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:17.501
What?

01:58:17.626 --> 01:58:20.083
Nothing. I'm off.

01:58:20.209 --> 01:58:21.792
Good luck!

01:58:37.334 --> 01:58:38.918
Good morning!

01:58:42.459 --> 01:58:43.667
Why don't we get going?

01:58:52.375 --> 01:58:54.292
Hey, isn't that Ishida?

01:58:55.209 --> 01:58:56.209
Who?

01:58:56.375 --> 01:58:58.876
Huh? The guy who jumped onto the river?

01:58:59.292 --> 01:59:00.292
Oops...

01:59:04.667 --> 01:59:06.959
Honestly, this is the first time I told you,

01:59:07.083 --> 01:59:10.292
I don't really fit in at school.

01:59:12.834 --> 01:59:17.000
I have difficulty looking at someone in the eyes.

01:59:17.334 --> 01:59:21.209
So it is easier for me to look downward.

01:59:24.667 --> 01:59:26.834
Huh? It's OK to look downward?

01:59:29.125 --> 01:59:30.542
Ni... Nishimiya...

01:59:31.083 --> 01:59:33.334
I can walk normally by myself, you know.

01:59:34.375 --> 01:59:35.918
Thank you, Nishimiya.

01:59:36.292 --> 01:59:38.209
This is my class.

01:59:43.501 --> 01:59:45.834
Ishida-kun? Hey, it's Ishida-kun!

01:59:45.959 --> 01:59:48.501
Are you OK now?

01:59:50.334 --> 01:59:51.542
Nishimiya.

01:59:51.792 --> 01:59:54.834
I think I have a stomachache.

01:59:56.501 --> 01:59:57.501
Sorry.

01:59:57.667 --> 01:59:58.542
Ya-sho!

01:59:58.667 --> 01:59:59.667
Huh?

02:00:11.751 --> 02:00:12.834
Ya-sho?

02:00:14.417 --> 02:00:15.792
Nagatsuka---kun?

02:00:16.125 --> 02:00:18.125
Ya-sho, are you suffering
from a stomachache?

02:00:20.959 --> 02:00:21.959
Ya-sho.

02:00:22.501 --> 02:00:25.709
Hi, Nagatsuka-kun.
Good morning. Are you OK?

02:00:26.334 --> 02:00:27.834
Ya-sho.

02:00:27.959 --> 02:00:29.876
Why you are looking downward?

02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.209
Oh, really? I don't know why.

02:00:32.667 --> 02:00:36.209
Actually I came here to face you all.

02:00:36.375 --> 02:00:37.575
But I might be a bit scared...

02:00:38.042 --> 02:00:40.250
Hey, Ya-sho...?

02:00:40.584 --> 02:00:41.584
Ishida-kun!!

02:00:42.417 --> 02:00:44.751
I'm really really happy you came back.

02:00:46.042 --> 02:00:47.542
If you... oops,

02:00:48.167 --> 02:00:50.501
If you didn't wake up,

02:00:50.626 --> 02:00:53.501
I would have lost everything.

02:00:54.292 --> 02:00:54.959
Ya-sho,

02:00:55.292 --> 02:00:57.209
Don't mind any more about

02:00:57.334 --> 02:00:58.459
what happened at the bridge.

02:00:58.792 --> 02:01:01.834
Such minor troubles will happen
again and again as long as we live.

02:01:02.334 --> 02:01:04.667
So, Ya-sho, please, please,

02:01:05.083 --> 02:01:07.501
never leave me!

02:01:07.709 --> 02:01:09.083
Pleeeease!

02:01:09.209 --> 02:01:10.834
Nagatsuka-kun.

02:01:12.417 --> 02:01:13.542
I'm very sorry

02:01:13.667 --> 02:01:16.250
for so many things.

02:01:17.501 --> 02:01:18.584
And,

02:01:19.250 --> 02:01:20.459
thank you.

02:01:20.792 --> 02:01:22.751
Ya-sho!

02:01:23.209 --> 02:01:24.929
By the way, what happened to your mustache?

02:01:25.417 --> 02:01:29.501
Consider it a sacrifice for your recovery.

02:01:30.042 --> 02:01:31.792
Nagatsuka-kun.

02:01:36.459 --> 02:01:37.292
Huh?

02:01:37.417 --> 02:01:38.959
Why is everyone here?

02:01:39.083 --> 02:01:43.417
We heard Nagatsuka-kun's
calling Ishida-kun's name.

02:01:43.792 --> 02:01:45.083
I see.

02:01:45.459 --> 02:01:48.542
Kawai-san. You have the
you-know-what to give him,

02:01:48.667 --> 02:01:49.667
don't you?

02:01:49.709 --> 02:01:51.751
Huh... yes, I have it.

02:01:51.876 --> 02:01:54.125
But it was a failure,
so we cannot give him that...

02:01:54.375 --> 02:01:56.834
Why not? Let's just give it to him.

02:01:57.292 --> 02:01:58.667
OK...

02:02:02.250 --> 02:02:04.334
This is... "thousand paper cranes"

02:02:04.459 --> 02:02:07.584
I really worked hard to collect a thousand,

02:02:07.709 --> 02:02:09.435
but I couldn't! It is far less than a thousand...

02:02:09.459 --> 02:02:12.375
I asked all the classmates
again and again, but...

02:02:12.584 --> 02:02:13.876
I'm very sorry.

02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:15.626
N--No, it's amazing!

02:02:15.751 --> 02:02:16.918
It's enough.

02:02:17.042 --> 02:02:19.250
I've never gotten anything like this before,

02:02:19.375 --> 02:02:21.209
and I am really happy.

02:02:21.834 --> 02:02:23.334
Thank you Kawai-san.

02:02:23.459 --> 02:02:25.375
And, I am sorry.

02:02:25.542 --> 02:02:26.622
I'm sorry too, Mashiba-kun.

02:02:27.083 --> 02:02:29.459
Not at all. You are amazing.

02:02:29.584 --> 02:02:31.626
Ugh!

02:02:31.751 --> 02:02:34.667
You are becoming friends, that makes me sick!

02:02:34.792 --> 02:02:37.501
You are always saying
such nasty things, Nao-chan!

02:02:37.792 --> 02:02:39.876
Oh? Kawai-chi?

02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:40.876
Are you looking for a fight?

02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:43.125
Hey, stop it, both of you!

02:02:43.501 --> 02:02:45.209
Oh... Ishida-kun.

02:02:45.876 --> 02:02:47.709
I'm sorry, Ishida-kun.

02:02:48.042 --> 02:02:50.918
You have been through so much,

02:02:51.667 --> 02:02:53.167
while I have not changed a bit.

02:02:54.751 --> 02:02:55.918
Don't say that.

02:02:56.584 --> 02:02:57.959
I have not changed, too.

02:02:59.334 --> 02:03:02.459
Hey, let's not talk about anything
sad or serious now!

02:03:04.918 --> 02:03:06.417
You said sorry again!

02:03:07.626 --> 02:03:10.334
But, I suppose that is your personality.

02:03:11.167 --> 02:03:12.792
Stu--pit! (Ha / ka)

02:03:17.501 --> 02:03:19.125
Stu--pid. (Ba / ka)

02:03:19.834 --> 02:03:21.292
Stupid! (Baka!)

02:03:21.667 --> 02:03:22.667
Eh...

02:03:23.959 --> 02:03:25.417
Pff!

02:03:27.459 --> 02:03:29.083
Hey, now I'm hungry.

02:03:29.292 --> 02:03:30.584
I'm going to get fried chicken!

02:03:30.918 --> 02:03:31.918
Oh, she ran away.

02:03:31.959 --> 02:03:33.292
No, she was just embarrassed.

02:03:36.459 --> 02:03:37.459
Hi, everyone,

02:03:37.542 --> 02:03:40.083
I have a favor to ask you all.

02:03:40.292 --> 02:03:41.292
Is that OK?

02:03:42.918 --> 02:03:47.375
I want us to go around the school
together, during today's festival.

02:04:06.292 --> 02:04:08.209
Hmmm, it tastes really good!

02:04:08.334 --> 02:04:10.459
Let's go to the gymnasium next!

02:04:10.626 --> 02:04:12.834
I'm amazed he can even show his face at school.

02:04:12.959 --> 02:04:15.459
Hey, hey, the stall by class #B is really good!

02:04:15.626 --> 02:04:16.666
Really? Let's go together!

02:05:59.667 --> 02:06:02.709
<i>Fell in love as</i>

02:06:02.834 --> 02:06:09.375
<i>Ah... I fell in love...</i>

02:06:27.459 --> 02:06:30.208
<i>Well, please raise your face</i>

02:06:30.209 --> 02:06:34.374
<i>Then you can see I am here in front of you</i>

02:06:34.375 --> 02:06:39.167
<i>So stop crying any more</i>

02:06:43.250 --> 02:06:49.750
<i>You gave me special time even
when my heart had been broken</i>

02:06:49.751 --> 02:06:57.751
<i>A red which was a bit tangled</i>

02:07:02.459 --> 02:07:10.459
<i>A white which was a color
of corridor at that days</i>

02:07:14.292 --> 02:07:22.292
<i>Beginning, last time, and now</i>

02:07:24.584 --> 02:07:32.584
<i>I'll convey you carving on
petals which are fluttering</i>

02:07:36.292 --> 02:07:37.791
<i>Darling</i>

02:07:37.792 --> 02:07:45.792
<i>You and I reflected on raindrops</i>

02:07:47.876 --> 02:07:55.876
<i>No one in the world knows</i>

02:08:03.417 --> 02:08:09.041
<i>Ah... I fell in love...
I don't remember since when</i>

02:08:09.042 --> 02:08:12.541
<i>How many times I cried</i>

02:08:12.542 --> 02:08:18.416
<i>If I count it, it will take the whole night</i>

02:08:18.417 --> 02:08:23.166
<i>I'll be puzzled...</i>

02:08:23.167 --> 02:08:27.501
<i>Darling</i>

02:08:36.250 --> 02:08:43.792
<i>What I want to convey to you now</i>

02:08:44.792 --> 02:08:49.166
<i>has been same and not changed</i>

02:08:49.167 --> 02:08:57.167
<i>since the past time.</i>

02:08:58.334 --> 02:08:59.750
<i>Darling</i>

02:08:59.751 --> 02:09:07.751
<i>The only one signpost</i>

02:09:10.042 --> 02:09:18.042
<i>we can walk without losing our way</i>

02:09:19.305 --> 02:09:25.275
