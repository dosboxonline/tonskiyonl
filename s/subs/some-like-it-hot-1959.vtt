04:41.490 --> 04:43.482
All right, Charlie.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.487
- That the joint?
- Yes, sir.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.735
- Who runs it?
- I already told you.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.866
- Refresh my memory.
- Spats Colombo.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.073
That's very refreshing.
What's the password?

04:52.167 --> 04:53.408
"I come to Grandma's funeral."

04:53.502 --> 04:55.789
- Here's your admission card.
- Thanks, Charlie.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.649
Now, if you want a ringside table,
just tell 'em that you're one of the pallbearers.

04:58.673 --> 05:01.040
- Okay, Charlie.
- We're all set. When's the kickoff?

05:01.134 --> 05:04.627
Look, Chief, I better blow, 'cause if Colombo
sees me, it's gonna be good-bye, Charlie.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.132
Good-bye, Charlie.

05:08.558 --> 05:11.471
Give me five minutes.
Then hit 'em with everything you got.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.268
You betcha.

05:28.870 --> 05:31.362
Good evening, sir.
I'm Mr. Mozarella.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.039
- What can I do for you?
- I come to the old lady's funeral.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.617
I don't believe I've ever seen you
at our services before.

05:36.711 --> 05:39.203
- That's because I've been on the wagon.
- Please!

05:39.297 --> 05:41.818
Where they having the wake?
I'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.710
Show the gentleman into the chapel.
Pew number three.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.840
Yes, Mr. Mozarella. This way, sir.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.861
Well, if you gotta go,
that's the way to do it.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.442
Follow me, please.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.715
- What'll it be, sir?
- Booze.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.464
- Sorry, sir, we only serve coffee.
- Coffee?

06:27.554 --> 06:30.262
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee,
sour mash coffee.

06:30.348 --> 06:33.091
Scotch. Make it a demitasse,
with soda on the side.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.846
Wait a minute.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.144
Haven't you got another pew,
not so close to the band?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.937
How about that one over there?

06:39.024 --> 06:42.062
Sorry, sir, but that's reserved
for members of the immediate family.

06:52.787 --> 06:54.323
Oops.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.458
Hey! Hey!
I want another cup of coffee!

07:03.548 --> 07:06.336
I want another cup of coffee!

07:17.395 --> 07:19.762
Better bring a check
in case the joint is raided.

07:19.856 --> 07:23.349
- Who's gonna raid a funeral?
- Some people got no respect for the dead.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.376
Say, Joe, tonight's the night, isn't it?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.087
- I'll say.
- What? No, tonight's the night we get paid.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.342
- That's good.
- Why?

07:54.432 --> 07:56.344
I lost a filling in one of my back teeth.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.954
- I gotta see a dentist tomorrow.
- Dentist?

07:57.978 --> 08:00.706
We been out of work for four months, you want
to blow your first week's pay on your teeth?

08:00.730 --> 08:02.833
What? It's just a filling.
It doesn't have to be gold.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.895
"It doesn't have to be gold."
How can you be so selfish?

08:05.986 --> 08:09.229
We owe back rent.
We're in for $89 to Moe's Delicatessen.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.926
Three Chinese lawyers are suing us
because our check bounced at the laundry.

08:11.950 --> 08:13.870
We've borrowed money
from every girl in the line.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.638
- You're right.
- Well, of course I'm right.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.974
First thing tomorrow, we'll pay everybody
a little somethin' on account.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.239
- Oh, no, we don't.
- We don't?

08:19.332 --> 08:23.201
First thing tomorrow we go out to the dog track
and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.

08:23.294 --> 08:25.536
Greased Lightning?
You're gonna bet my money on a dog?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.233
He's a shoo-in.
I got it from Max the waiter.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.276
His brother-in-law is the electrician
that wires the rabbit.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.988
- What are you giving me with a rabbit!
- Look at the odds. He's ten-to-one.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.595
- Tomorrow, we'll pay everybody.
- Suppose he loses.

08:34.681 --> 08:37.159
What are you worried about?
This job is gonna last a long time.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.640
Suppose it doesn't.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.219
Jerry boy, why do you have to
paint everything so black?

08:41.312 --> 08:43.144
- Oh!
- Suppose you got hit by a truck.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.393
Suppose the stock market crashes.

08:45.984 --> 08:48.772
Suppose Mary Pickford
divorces Douglas Fairbanks.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.728
Suppose the Dodgers leave Brooklyn.

08:51.531 --> 08:53.944
- Joe.
- Suppose Lake Michigan overflows.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.617
Well, don't look now,
but the whole town is under water.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.379
Four...

09:12.469 --> 09:13.755
three...

09:13.845 --> 09:15.336
two...

09:15.430 --> 09:16.591
one.

09:20.185 --> 09:23.804
Oh! Oh!

09:29.277 --> 09:32.896
All right, everybody! This is a raid.

09:32.989 --> 09:35.106
I'm a federal agent!
You're all under arrest!

09:37.202 --> 09:39.740
I want another cup of coffee!

09:51.591 --> 09:53.958
All right, Spats. Services are over.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.964
- Let's go.
- Go where?

09:56.054 --> 09:58.512
A little country club
we run for retired bootleggers.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.339
I'm puttin' your name up
for membership.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.301
- I don't join nothin'.
- Oh, you'll like it there.

10:03.394 --> 10:06.933
I'll get the prison tailor to fit you
with a pair of special spats, striped.

10:08.274 --> 10:11.438
Big joke. What's the rap this time?

10:11.528 --> 10:13.736
Embalming people with coffee...

10:13.822 --> 10:15.563
86 proof.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.149
Me? I'm just a customer here.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.200
Oh, come on, Spats.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.575
We know you own the joint.
Mozarella's just frontin' for you.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.201
Mozarella?

10:25.291 --> 10:27.829
- Never heard of him.
- We got different information.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.878
From who? Toothpick Charlie, maybe?

10:30.964 --> 10:33.877
Toothpick Charlie? Never heard of him.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.380
Buttermilk.

10:39.055 --> 10:41.593
Too smart to drink your own stuff, huh?

10:41.683 --> 10:43.470
Come on. On your feet.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.723
You're just wastin' the taxpayers' money.

10:46.813 --> 10:48.554
Call your lawyer if you wanna.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.605
These are my lawyers.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.183
All Harvard men.

10:53.444 --> 10:54.560
Outside.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.647
I want another cup of coffee!

11:00.034 --> 11:02.196
I want another cup of coffee!

11:05.540 --> 11:07.998
Get over there!

11:18.636 --> 11:21.128
Get over there, will ya!

11:28.980 --> 11:30.721
Get goin'. Come on!

11:41.367 --> 11:43.074
Well, that solves one problem.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.139
Now we don't have to worry about
who we're gonna pay first.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.766
- Quiet. I'm thinking.
- Of course the landlady's gonna lock us out.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.328
Moe down at the delicatessen,
no more knockwurst on credit.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.897
We can't borrow from the girls
because they're on the way to jail.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.412
- Shut up.
- And we're...

11:54.505 --> 11:57.464
I wonder how much Sam the bookie
will give us for our overcoats.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.041
Sam the bookie?

11:59.135 --> 12:02.253
Nothing doing! You're not gonna put
my overcoat on a dog. Oh, you...

12:02.347 --> 12:04.259
Look, Jerry, I told you it's a sure thing.

12:04.349 --> 12:05.635
We will freeze.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.933
It is below zero. We'll get pneumonia.

12:08.019 --> 12:11.979
Look, stupid, he's ten-to-one.
Tomorrow, we'll have 20 overcoats.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.431
Joe...

12:22.408 --> 12:23.944
Greased Lightning!

12:24.035 --> 12:26.698
Oh, why do I listen to you?
I oughta have my head examined.

12:26.788 --> 12:28.324
I thought you weren't talking to me.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.827
Look at the bull fiddle!
It's dressed warmer than I am!

12:38.424 --> 12:39.960
- Anything today?
- Nothing.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.258
Thank you.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.846
Anything today?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.844
- Nothing.
- Thank you.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.846
I can't go on, Joe.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.770
I'm weak from hunger,
I'm running a fever, I got a hole in my shoe.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.347
If you gave me a chance,
we could be living like kings.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.353
- Oh? How?
- There's a dog running in the third.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.025
- His name is Galloping Ghost.
- Oh, no.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.731
Oh, yes. He's 15-to-1, and it's
his kind of a track. He's a real mudder.

13:02.824 --> 13:05.111
What do you want from me,
my head on a plate?

13:05.201 --> 13:07.930
No, just your bass. If we hocked that
and my sax, we could get at least...

13:07.954 --> 13:11.538
Are you out of your mind? We're up the creek
and you want to hock the paddle.

13:11.624 --> 13:14.241
All right, go ahead and starve.
What do I care? Freeze!

13:14.335 --> 13:16.418
Anything today?

13:16.504 --> 13:17.995
Oh, it's you.

13:18.089 --> 13:20.706
- Well, you got a lot of nerve.
- Thank you.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.172
Joe! Come back here!

13:25.763 --> 13:27.504
Mm-hmm.

13:28.224 --> 13:31.808
Now, Nellie baby, if it's about Saturday night,
I can explain everything.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.135
What a heel.

13:33.229 --> 13:37.519
I spend four dollars to get my hair marcelled,
I buy me a brand-new negligee,

13:37.608 --> 13:41.227
I bake him a great big pizza pie,
and where were you?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.983
Where were you?

13:43.072 --> 13:44.313
- With you.
- Me?

13:44.407 --> 13:46.114
Don't you remember?
You had this bad tooth.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.317
It was all impacted,
and his jaw was all swole out.

13:48.411 --> 13:51.028
It was? Oh, yeah, was it ever.

13:51.122 --> 13:54.081
I had to take him to the hospital
and give him a blood transfusion. Right?

13:54.167 --> 13:56.580
- Right. We have the same type blood.
- Type "O."

13:56.669 --> 13:57.910
- "O"?
- Oh?

13:58.671 --> 14:00.537
Nellie baby, I'll make it up to you.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.543
You're makin' it up
pretty good so far.

14:02.633 --> 14:05.876
As soon as we get a job, I'm gonna take you
to the swellest restaurant in town.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.212
How about it, Nellie?

14:08.306 --> 14:10.593
Has Poliakoff got anything for us?
We're desperate.

14:11.351 --> 14:15.015
Well, it just so happens
he <i>is</i> looking for a bass.

14:15.104 --> 14:17.061
And a sax.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.605
Right?

14:18.691 --> 14:20.148
Right.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.317
- What's the job?
- Three weeks in Florida.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.520
- Florida!
- At the Seminole-Ritz in Miami.

14:24.614 --> 14:27.152
Transportation and expenses all paid.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.198
Isn't she a bit of terrific?

14:29.285 --> 14:30.387
- Come on. Let's see Poliakoff.
- Yeah.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.097
Hold on.
He's got some people in there with him.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.201
- You'll have to wait, boys.
- All right, we'll wait.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.831
Look, Gladys, it's three weeks in Florida.

14:36.918 --> 14:39.626
Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.

14:39.712 --> 14:42.580
They need a couple of girls
on sax and bass.

14:42.673 --> 14:45.916
What do you mean, "Who is it?"
It's Poliakoff. I got a job for you.

14:46.677 --> 14:48.464
Gladys, are you there?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.590
Gladys!

14:50.890 --> 14:52.006
Meshuggener.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.262
Played 112 hours at a marathon dance.

14:54.352 --> 14:57.265
- Now she's in bed with a nervous collapse.
- Tell her to move over.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.017
What about Cora Jackson?

14:59.107 --> 15:02.691
The last I heard of her,
she was playing with a "Salivation" Army act.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.439
Drexel-9044.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.942
Oh, those idiot broads.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.569
Here we are, already packed,
ready to leave for Miami.

15:09.659 --> 15:11.241
And what happens?

15:11.327 --> 15:13.410
The saxophone runs off
with a Bible salesman,

15:13.496 --> 15:16.534
and the bass fiddle
gets herself pregnant.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.707
Bienstock, I oughta fire you!

15:18.793 --> 15:22.002
Me? I'm the manager of the band,
not the night watchman.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.705
Hello. Let me talk to Bessie Malone.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.791
What's she doing in Philadelphia?

15:27.635 --> 15:29.092
On the level?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.676
Bessie let her hair grow.
Now she's playing with Stokowski.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.176
Black Bottom Bessie?

15:34.267 --> 15:36.759
<i>Spielt sich mit der Philharmonie!</i>

15:37.478 --> 15:38.889
How about Rosemary Schultz?

15:38.980 --> 15:40.937
She slashed her wrists
when Valentino died.

15:41.023 --> 15:44.767
Well, we might as well all slash our wrists
unless we round up two dames by this evening.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.773
Look, Sig, you know
the kind of girls we need.

15:46.863 --> 15:49.299
We don't care where you find them.
Just get them on that train by eight o'clock.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.235
Be nonchalant. Trust Poliakoff.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.512
The moment anything turns up,
I'll give you a little jingle.

15:53.536 --> 15:56.449
Bye, Sig. I wonder if I got room
for another ulcer.

15:56.539 --> 15:58.326
Nellie, get me long distance.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.992
- Look, Sig, we want to talk to you.
- What is it?

16:01.085 --> 16:03.293
- It's about the Florida job.
- The Florida job?

16:03.379 --> 16:05.774
- Mm-hmm. Nellie told us all about it.
- We're not too late, are we?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.541
What are you, a couple of comedians?
Get outta here.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.297
Long distance? Get me
the William Morris Agency in New York.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.908
- Well, you need a bass and a sax, don't you?
- The instruments are right, but you're not.

16:14.932 --> 16:17.732
- I want to speak to Mr. Morris.
- Wait a minute. What's wrong with us?

16:17.810 --> 16:19.722
You're the wrong shape. Good-bye!

16:19.812 --> 16:22.374
The wrong shape? What are you looking for,
hunchbacks or something?

16:22.398 --> 16:25.311
- It's not the backs that worry me.
- What kind of a band is it anyway?

16:25.401 --> 16:27.563
- You gotta be under 25.
- We could pass for that.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.565
- You gotta be blonde.
- We could dye our hair.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.966
- And you gotta be girls!
- We could...

16:30.990 --> 16:32.481
No, we couldn't.

16:32.575 --> 16:35.318
- Mr. William Morris.
- You mean this is a girl's band?

16:35.411 --> 16:37.973
Yeah. That's what he means.
Good old Nellie. I could wring her neck.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.284
- I'm holding on.
- Let's talk this thing over.

16:40.374 --> 16:41.865
Why <i>couldn't</i> we do it, huh?

16:41.959 --> 16:44.980
Last year when we worked in the Gypsy tearoom,
we wore gold earrings, didn't we?

16:45.004 --> 16:48.463
Remember when you booked us
with the Hawaiian band? We wore grass skirts.

16:48.549 --> 16:51.838
- What's with him? He drinks?
- No. But he ain't been eatin' so good either.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.968
He's got an empty stomach
and it's gone to his head.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.221
Joe, this is three weeks in Florida.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.285
We could borrow some clothes
from the girls in the chorus.

16:58.309 --> 17:01.723
- You've flipped your wig.
- Now you're talking. <i>Now</i> he is talking!

17:01.812 --> 17:04.458
We get a couple of secondhand wigs,
a little padding here and there,

17:04.482 --> 17:07.065
we call ourselves
Josephine and Geraldine!

17:07.151 --> 17:08.858
- Josephine and Geraldine.
- Yeah.

17:08.944 --> 17:10.310
- Come on!
- B-But...

17:10.404 --> 17:13.112
Look, if you boys want to
pick up a little money tonight,

17:13.199 --> 17:15.886
at the University of Illinois they're having,
you should pardon the expression,

17:15.910 --> 17:17.276
a Saint Valentine's dance.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.828
- We'll take it.
- You got it. Six dollars a man.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.906
Be on the campus in Urbana at eight o'clock.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.833
All the way to Urbana
for a one-night stand?

17:24.919 --> 17:28.127
It's $12. We can get
one of the overcoats out of hock.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.673
Hello, Mr. Morris?
This is Poliakoff in Chicago.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.959
Say, you wouldn't happen to have a couple
of girl musicians available, would you?

17:35.012 --> 17:36.344
A sax player and a bass?

17:36.430 --> 17:38.342
Look, if William Morris
doesn't come through...

17:38.432 --> 17:40.594
Come on, Geraldine.

17:42.311 --> 17:45.554
It's a hundred miles, it's snowing outside.
Now, how are we gonna get there?

17:45.648 --> 17:47.292
- I'll think of something.
- You'll think... Like what?

17:47.316 --> 17:49.979
- Don't crowd me.
- "Don't crowd me. Don't crowd me."

17:50.069 --> 17:51.651
How'd it go, girls?

17:51.737 --> 17:53.820
Oh, you... I oughta wring your neck.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.193
Please, Jerry!
That's no way to talk.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.488
Nellie baby, what are you doing tonight?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.195
Tonight? Why?

18:01.289 --> 18:03.702
'Cause I've got some plans.

18:03.791 --> 18:05.703
I'm not doing anything.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.284
Really?

18:07.378 --> 18:11.213
I just thought I'd go home
and have some cold pizza.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.712
Then you'll be in all evening?

18:13.801 --> 18:15.383
Yes, Joe.

18:15.469 --> 18:17.506
Good!
Then you won't be needing your car.

18:17.597 --> 18:19.964
My car? Why, you...

18:22.435 --> 18:25.178
Isn't he a bit of terrific?

18:34.655 --> 18:37.819
We could've had three weeks in Florida,
all expenses paid.

18:37.908 --> 18:41.117
Lyin' in the sun, palm trees, flyin' fish.

18:41.203 --> 18:42.819
Knock it off, will ya?

18:45.916 --> 18:49.785
Possible straight, possible nothing,
and a pair of eights.

18:53.007 --> 18:56.000
- All right, drop 'em, you guys.
- Yeah? Well, drop what?

18:56.093 --> 18:57.880
- We came for a car.
- Oh, yeah?

18:57.970 --> 18:59.962
Yeah, Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.476
Musicians. Wise guys.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.349
Okay, let's go. Aces bet.

19:09.273 --> 19:12.266
It's a '25 Hupmobile.
Green coupe, sir.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.568
- It's over here.
- Over here.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.145
- Want some gas?
- Uh, yeah.

19:16.238 --> 19:19.606
About, uh, 40 cents worth, please.

19:19.700 --> 19:22.943
- Put it on Miss Weinmeyer's bill?
- Uh, yeah, why not?

19:23.037 --> 19:24.619
And while you're at it, fill it up.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.629
All right, everybody, hands up!

19:40.471 --> 19:42.303
Face the wall!

19:44.767 --> 19:46.759
You too, Toothpick.

19:46.852 --> 19:48.059
Come on!

19:50.606 --> 19:51.847
Come on.

20:03.369 --> 20:04.576
Hey.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.028
Join us.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.716
Okay, boss.

20:32.773 --> 20:35.436
Hello, Charlie. Long time no see.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.643
What is it, Spats?
What are you doing here?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.774
I just dropped in to pay my respects.

20:39.864 --> 20:42.231
- You don't owe me no nothin'.
- I wouldn't say that.

20:42.324 --> 20:45.053
You were nice enough to recommend
my mortuary to some of your friends.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.471
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

20:46.495 --> 20:50.034
Now I got all those coffins on my hands
and I hate to see 'em go to waste.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.207
Honest, Spats.
I had nothing to do with it.

20:52.293 --> 20:54.159
Oh, too bad, Charlie.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.245
You would've had three eights.

21:00.217 --> 21:01.628
Good-bye, Charlie.

21:01.719 --> 21:04.757
No, Spats, no! No, Spats!
Please, no, n...

21:11.520 --> 21:14.604
I think I'm gonna be sick.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.690
All right, come on out of there.

21:22.323 --> 21:23.734
Come on.

21:24.867 --> 21:26.358
Come on!

21:26.452 --> 21:28.444
We di... We didn't see anything.
Did we?

21:28.537 --> 21:31.154
- What? No. Nothing. No.
- See?

21:31.248 --> 21:34.728
Besides, it's none of our business if you guys
want to bump each other off. We don't...

21:36.253 --> 21:39.621
Say, don't I know you two
from somewhere?

21:39.715 --> 21:42.458
Oh, no. No.
We're just a couple of musicians.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.760
W-We came to pick up a car.
Nellie Weinmeyer's car.

21:45.846 --> 21:47.633
There's a dance tonight.

21:47.723 --> 21:49.885
- Come on, Jerry.
- Wait a minute.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.638
- Where do you think you're going?
- Urbana.

21:52.728 --> 21:54.936
I-It's about a hundred miles from here,
so don't...

21:55.022 --> 21:56.729
You're not goin' nowhere.

21:58.734 --> 21:59.770
We're not?

21:59.860 --> 22:03.444
- I don't like no witnesses.
- We won't breathe a word.

22:03.531 --> 22:05.523
You won't breathe nothin'.

22:05.616 --> 22:06.948
Not even air.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.703
Wh...

22:40.276 --> 22:43.519
All right, boys, let's blow out of here.
We'll take care of those guys later.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.706
I think they got me.
I think they got me.

23:00.796 --> 23:02.162
They got the bull fiddle.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.589
- No blood?
- If they catch us, there'll be blood all over.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.382
Type "O." Come on.

23:20.274 --> 23:22.419
- Joe, where are you running?
- As far away as possible.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.363
That's not far enough.
You don't know those guys.

23:24.445 --> 23:27.563
They know us.
Every hood in Chicago's gonna be after us, Joe.

23:40.586 --> 23:41.897
- Quick, give me a nickel.
- What?

23:41.921 --> 23:43.753
- Give me a nickel.
- All right.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.166
Here... Oh.
You're gonna call the police, huh?

23:47.259 --> 23:49.922
Police? We'd never live to testify.
Not against Spats Colombo.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.344
Wabash 1098.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.843
Joe, we gotta get out of town.
Maybe we should grow beards.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.660
We are getting out of town,
but we're gonna shave.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.550
Shave? At a time like this?

23:57.645 --> 24:00.457
Those guys got machine guns ready
to blast our heads off, you want to shave.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.939
- Shave our legs, stupid.
- Shave our legs? Wh...

24:04.860 --> 24:06.500
Hello? Mr. Poliakoff?

24:07.488 --> 24:10.481
I understand you're looking
for a couple of girl musicians.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.195
Mm-hmm.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.368
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.945
Mm-hmm.

24:28.133 --> 24:32.969
Florida Limited <i>leaving
on track one for Washington, Charleston,</i>

24:33.055 --> 24:35.468
<i>Savannah, Jacksonville, and Miami.</i>

24:35.557 --> 24:38.470
<i>All aboard. All aboard.</i>

24:44.191 --> 24:45.773
Ow!

24:46.610 --> 24:49.603
- What's the matter now?
- How do they walk in these things? Huh?

24:49.697 --> 24:52.217
- How do they keep their balance?
- Must be the way the weight is distributed.

24:52.241 --> 24:53.527
Now, come on.

24:54.618 --> 24:57.031
It is <i>so</i> drafty.

24:57.121 --> 24:59.033
They must be catching cold
all the time.

24:59.123 --> 25:01.101
Will you quit stalling.
We're gonna miss the train.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.492
I feel naked.
I feel like everybody's staring at me.

25:03.585 --> 25:06.043
With those legs? Are you crazy?
Now, come on.

25:07.381 --> 25:10.215
Uh-oh.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.761
It's no use.
We're not gonna get away with it, Joe.

25:18.851 --> 25:22.390
The name is Josephine,
and this was your idea in the first place.

25:45.627 --> 25:47.664
Look at that.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.291
Look how she moves.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.964
That's just like Jell-O on springs.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.384
Must have some sort of
built-in motor or something.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.845
I tell you, it's a whole different sex!

25:57.931 --> 26:00.719
What are you afraid of?
Nobody's asking you to have a baby.

26:00.809 --> 26:03.913
This is just to get us out of town. Once we
get to Florida, we'll blow this whole setup.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.457
This time I am not gonna let you
talk me into something that...

26:06.482 --> 26:09.850
Extra! Extra! Seven slaughtered
in north side garage!

26:09.943 --> 26:12.401
Feared bloody aftermath!
Extra! Extra!

26:12.488 --> 26:14.480
You talked me into it.
Let's go, Josephine.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.314
Attagirl, Geraldine.

26:18.619 --> 26:19.985
- Rosella?
- Fiddle.

26:20.079 --> 26:22.036
- Move along, Dolores, will ya.
- Trombone.

26:22.122 --> 26:23.863
- Hey, Olga, how's your back?
- Trumpet.

26:26.960 --> 26:28.667
Uh, well, here we are.

26:28.754 --> 26:30.666
Are you two
from the Poliakoff Agency?

26:30.756 --> 26:32.817
- Yes, we're the new girls.
- Brand-new.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.629
- This is our manager, Mr. Bienstock.
- How do you do?

26:35.719 --> 26:37.585
And I'm Sweet Sue.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.217
My name is Josephine.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.094
- I'm Daphne.
- Hmm?

26:43.102 --> 26:45.139
Saxophone, bass.
Am I glad to see you girls.

26:45.229 --> 26:48.313
- You saved our lives.
- Likewise, I'm sure.

26:48.857 --> 26:50.849
Where did you girls play before?

26:50.943 --> 26:54.402
Here, there and around and, uh...

26:54.488 --> 26:57.981
We spent three years at
the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

26:58.075 --> 27:00.613
- Hmm?
- All aboard!

27:00.702 --> 27:02.989
You're in berths 7 and 7-A.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.321
7 and 7-A.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.155
- Thanks ever so.
- You're welcome.

27:06.250 --> 27:07.786
Oh, the feeling's mutual.

27:09.962 --> 27:12.170
- Upsy-daisy.
- Fresh.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.836
Looks like Poliakoff came through
with a couple of real ladies.

27:15.926 --> 27:18.126
You better tell the other girls
to watch their language.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.144
Daphne?

27:32.234 --> 27:34.521
Well, I never did like the name Geraldine.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.280
Hi!

27:43.370 --> 27:45.282
I'm the bass fiddle.
Just call me Daphne.

27:45.372 --> 27:46.704
- Hi!
- Hi!

27:46.790 --> 27:50.283
- My name is Josephine. Sax.
- Hi!

27:50.377 --> 27:52.097
- Welcome to No Man's Land.
- Oh, thank you!

27:52.171 --> 27:54.128
You'll be sorry!

27:54.214 --> 27:57.628
- Take off your corsets and spread out.
- Oh, well, I don't wear one myself.

27:57.718 --> 28:00.256
- Don't you bulge?
- Huh? Bulge? Me?

28:00.345 --> 28:03.088
I have the most divine seamstress.
Comes in just once a month.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.799
- Well, my dear, she is so inexpensive.
- Come on, Daphne.

28:05.893 --> 28:07.429
Oh, all right.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.762
Say, kids, have you heard the one
about the girl tuba player

28:10.856 --> 28:13.564
who was stranded on a desert island
with a one-legged jockey?

28:13.650 --> 28:15.687
- No. How's it go?
- Cut it out, girls.

28:15.777 --> 28:17.689
None of that rough talk.

28:17.779 --> 28:19.941
They went to a conservatory.

28:20.032 --> 28:22.240
"They went to a conservatory."

28:25.454 --> 28:27.571
How about that talent, huh?

28:27.664 --> 28:29.951
It's like fallin' into a tub of butter.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.374
Watch it, Daphne.

28:31.460 --> 28:33.372
When I was a kid, Joe,
I used to have a dream

28:33.462 --> 28:37.581
where I was locked up overnight in a pastry shop,
and there was goodies all around.

28:37.674 --> 28:39.791
There was jelly rolls and mocha éclairs

28:39.885 --> 28:42.423
and sponge cake and Boston cream pie
and cherry tarts...

28:42.512 --> 28:43.781
- Look, stupe. Listen to me.
- Huh?

28:43.805 --> 28:46.138
No butter, no pastry. We're on a diet.

28:46.225 --> 28:48.012
Oh, yeah. Well, sure, Joe.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.644
Not there!
That's the emergency brake.

28:53.273 --> 28:55.356
Now you've done it.
Now you have done it.

28:55.442 --> 28:58.310
- Done what?
- You tore off one of my chests.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.272
- Well, you better go get it fixed.
- Well, you better come help me.

29:10.874 --> 29:12.957
This way, Daphne.

29:13.043 --> 29:15.035
Now you tore the other one.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.340
We're terribly sorry.

29:29.434 --> 29:31.926
It's okay.
I was scared it was Sweet Sue.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.603
- You won't tell anybody, will you?
- Tell what?

29:34.690 --> 29:38.309
Well, if they catch me once more,
they're gonna kick me out of the band.

29:39.987 --> 29:42.274
You the replacement for the bass and sax?

29:42.364 --> 29:44.105
That's us. And I'm Daphne.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.486
Uh, this is, uh, uh, Jo... sephine.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.533
Come here. Come here.

29:48.620 --> 29:50.612
- I'm Sugar Cane.
- Hi.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.288
- Sugar Cane?
- Yeah. I changed it.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.661
- It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk.
- Polish?

29:54.751 --> 29:57.585
Yes. I come from this musical family.

29:57.671 --> 30:00.209
My mother is a piano teacher.
My father was a conductor.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.463
- Where did he conduct?
- On the Baltimore and Ohio.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.133
Oh.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.925
I play the ukulele. And I sing too.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.552
Sings too!

30:10.642 --> 30:13.931
Well, I don't have much of a voice,
but then this isn't much of a band either.

30:14.021 --> 30:15.933
I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.

30:16.023 --> 30:20.063
- Running away from what?
- Oh, don't get me started on that.

30:20.152 --> 30:22.690
- Here. You want some? It's bourbon.
- Oh.

30:22.779 --> 30:25.317
I'll take a rain check.

30:26.908 --> 30:29.669
I don't want you to think I'm a drinker.
I can stop anytime I want to.

30:29.745 --> 30:32.829
Only I don't want to.
Especially when I'm blue.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.826
- We understand.
- All the girls drink.

30:34.916 --> 30:38.159
It's just that I'm the one that gets caught.
Story of my life.

30:38.253 --> 30:41.246
I always get the fuzzy end
of the lollipop.

30:46.386 --> 30:47.877
Are my seams straight?

30:47.971 --> 30:49.428
I'll say.

30:51.767 --> 30:54.180
- Well, see you around, girls.
- Bye, Sugar.

30:54.269 --> 30:57.353
We have been playing
with the wrong bands.

30:57.439 --> 30:58.555
- Down, Daphne.
- Whew!

30:58.648 --> 31:00.560
How about the shape
of that liquor cabinet, huh?

31:00.650 --> 31:03.393
Forget it. One false move,
and they'll toss us off the train.

31:03.487 --> 31:06.571
Then there'll be the police, the papers,
and the mob in Chicago.

31:06.656 --> 31:09.945
Mmm, boy, would I love to
borrow a cup of that Sugar.

31:10.035 --> 31:11.822
Look.

31:11.912 --> 31:15.451
No pastry, no butter, and no Sugar.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.623
Well, you tore 'em again.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.656
Hey, Sheboygan! You too.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.992
What was your last job,
playing square dances?

32:01.086 --> 32:02.998
No. Funerals.

32:03.088 --> 32:06.877
Well, would you mind rejoining the living?
Goose it up a little.

32:06.967 --> 32:08.583
We'll try.

32:09.302 --> 32:11.089
How did those holes get there?

32:11.179 --> 32:13.216
Uh, those?

32:15.142 --> 32:16.849
I don't know.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.016
Mice?

32:18.937 --> 32:20.665
All right, girls.
Let's take it from the top.

32:20.689 --> 32:22.681
And put a little heat under it!

32:28.405 --> 32:29.771
Yeah!

32:34.578 --> 32:35.659

Bienstock!

33:31.426 --> 33:32.792
Yes, Sue. What is it?

33:32.886 --> 33:36.721
I thought I made it perfectly clear
that I don't want any drinking in this outfit.

33:42.854 --> 33:45.187
All right, girls.
Who does this belong to?

33:45.273 --> 33:46.889
Come on now. Speak up.

33:47.734 --> 33:49.191
Sugar, I warned you.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.237
- Please, Mr. Bienstock.
- This is the last straw.

33:51.279 --> 33:53.737
In Kansas City you were smuggling liquor
in a shampoo bottle.

33:53.823 --> 33:55.801
Before that, I caught you
with a pint in your ukulele.

33:55.825 --> 33:57.845
Excuse me. Mr. Bienstock,
could I have my flask, please?

33:57.869 --> 33:59.952
- Sure.
- Pack your things. The next station we c...

34:00.038 --> 34:02.075
- Your flask?
- Yes. Just a little bourbon.

34:02.165 --> 34:04.248
Must've slipped through.

34:04.334 --> 34:06.371
Give me that.

34:06.461 --> 34:09.373
Didn't you girls say
you went to a conservatory?

34:09.464 --> 34:11.295
Oh, yes. For a whole year.

34:11.382 --> 34:13.591
I thought you said three years.

34:13.677 --> 34:15.885
We got time off for good behavior.

34:16.554 --> 34:19.844
There are two things that I will not
put up with during working hours.

34:19.933 --> 34:22.641
One is liquor,
and the other one is men.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.059
Men?

34:24.145 --> 34:26.056
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

34:26.147 --> 34:28.389
We wouldn't be caught dead with men.

34:28.483 --> 34:31.601
Rough, hairy beasts with eight hands.

34:31.695 --> 34:34.938
And they... they all just want
one thing from a girl.

34:35.031 --> 34:37.569
I beg your pardon, miss.

34:38.076 --> 34:41.114
All right, girls.
From the top again.

35:19.826 --> 35:22.034
- Hortense, good night.
- Good night, Daphne.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.908
- Maude, sweet dreams and pleasant thoughts.
- Good night, Daphne.

35:24.998 --> 35:26.785
- Good night, Gloria.
- Good night, Daphne.

35:26.875 --> 35:29.288
- Dolores, dear, you sleep tight.
- You hear?

35:30.712 --> 35:32.044
Nighty-night, Emily.

35:32.130 --> 35:33.871
Toodle-oo.

35:36.051 --> 35:38.964
How about that "toodle-oo"?

35:39.054 --> 35:40.511
Steady, boy.

35:41.181 --> 35:43.093
Just keep telling yourself you're a girl.

35:43.183 --> 35:45.161
- I'm a girl. I'm a girl.
- You're a girl. You're a girl.

35:45.185 --> 35:47.302
I'm a girl. I-I'm a girl.

35:48.229 --> 35:50.221
I'm a girl. I'm a...

35:51.107 --> 35:53.520
Hi.

35:54.861 --> 35:56.773
Get a load of that rhythm section.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.607
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

36:00.700 --> 36:01.986
I'm a girl.

36:02.077 --> 36:03.568
I'm a girl.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.867
Good night, Sugar!

36:11.670 --> 36:13.206
Good night, honey.

36:15.048 --> 36:17.131
"Honey." Hey, she called me "honey."

36:17.217 --> 36:19.584
Ooh, honey.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.010
Hey, what are you doin'?

36:21.096 --> 36:23.304
I just wanna make sure
that Honey stays in her hive.

36:23.390 --> 36:26.007
There'll be no buzzin' around tonight.

36:26.101 --> 36:29.014
Supposin' I got to go.
Like, for a drink of water or somethin'.

36:29.104 --> 36:30.220
Fight it.

36:30.313 --> 36:33.477
Well, suppose I lose.
Suppose it's an emergency.

36:33.566 --> 36:35.728
Pull the emergency brake.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.857
Hey, Bienstock.

36:38.947 --> 36:41.030
There's somethin' funny
about those new girls.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.357
Funny? In what way?

36:42.450 --> 36:45.113
Well, I don't know,
but I can feel it right here.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.867
That's one thing about an ulcer. It's like
having a burglar alarm go off inside you.

36:48.957 --> 36:51.870
All right, Sue. You watch your ulcers.
I'll watch those two.

36:51.960 --> 36:55.294
Okay. Everybody settle down
and go to bed. Good night, girls.

36:56.297 --> 36:57.754
Good night, Daphne.

36:57.841 --> 36:59.207
Good night, Josephine.

37:07.434 --> 37:09.391
I'm a girl.

37:09.477 --> 37:10.718
I'm a girl.

37:10.812 --> 37:12.303
I wish I were dead.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.389
I'm a girl. I'm a girl.

37:14.482 --> 37:16.690
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl.

37:16.776 --> 37:19.769
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl,
I'm a girl, I'm a girl.

37:59.027 --> 38:00.359
Daphne.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.196
Daphne.

38:10.830 --> 38:11.830
Sugar!

38:12.999 --> 38:15.457
I wanted to thank you
for covering up for me.

38:15.543 --> 38:16.750
You're a real pal.

38:17.796 --> 38:19.833
Oh, it's nothing.

38:19.923 --> 38:23.462
I, uh... I-I just thought
that us girls should stick together.

38:23.551 --> 38:26.385
If it wasn't for you,
they would have kicked me off the train.

38:26.471 --> 38:29.839
I'd be out in the middle of nowhere,
sitting on my ukulele.

38:30.517 --> 38:32.884
Oh! It's freezing outside!

38:32.977 --> 38:36.266
I mean, when I think about
you and your poor ukulele...

38:36.356 --> 38:38.894
If there's ever anything
I can do for you...

38:38.983 --> 38:41.145
I can think of a million things.

38:44.197 --> 38:46.280
- That's one of 'em.
- Shh.

38:46.366 --> 38:48.323
- Huh?
- Sweet Sue.

38:48.409 --> 38:49.409
Mm-hmm.

39:01.089 --> 39:03.251
I don't want her to know
we're in cahoots.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.253
Oh, well, we won't tell anybody.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.255
Not even Josephine.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.962
Maybe I'd better stay here
till she goes back to sleep.

39:10.056 --> 39:12.594
You stay here as long as you like.

39:15.979 --> 39:17.845
I'm not crowding you, am I?

39:17.939 --> 39:21.057
No. It's nice and cozy.

39:21.150 --> 39:23.858
When I was a little girl,
on cold nights like this,

39:23.945 --> 39:25.937
I used to crawl into bed with my sister.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.148
We'd cuddle up under the covers
and pretend we were lost in a dark cave

39:29.242 --> 39:31.154
and were trying to find our way out.

39:31.244 --> 39:33.531
That's very interesting.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.869
- Anything wrong?
- No, no, no.

39:37.959 --> 39:39.325
Not a thing.

39:41.004 --> 39:43.496
You poor thing. You're trembling all over.

39:43.590 --> 39:45.206
That's ridiculous.

39:45.884 --> 39:48.171
- Your head's hot.
- That's ridiculous.

39:49.345 --> 39:50.927
You've got cold feet.

39:51.014 --> 39:54.223
- Isn't that ridiculous?
- Here. Let me warm them up a little.

39:54.309 --> 39:55.308
There.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.426
- Isn't that better?
- Yes.

39:56.519 --> 39:58.399
I'm a girl, I'm a girl, I'm a girl.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.471
- What'd you say?
- I'm a very sick girl.

40:00.565 --> 40:02.477
Oh, I'd better go
before I catch something.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.854
- I'm not that sick.
- I've got very low resistance.

40:06.321 --> 40:09.814
Sugar, if you feel that you're
coming down with something, my dear,

40:09.908 --> 40:12.992
the best thing in the world
is a shot of whiskey.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.034
- You've got some?
- I know where to get it.

40:15.121 --> 40:17.613
Don't move. Shh.

40:18.207 --> 40:20.290
- Hold on.
- Okay.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.481
Up. Up. Now.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.029
Are you all right?

40:51.115 --> 40:53.448
- I'm fine.
- How's the bottle?

40:54.118 --> 40:55.734
Half full.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.738
- You better get some cups.
- Cups?

41:08.758 --> 41:12.297
Oh, I tell you, my dear,
this is the only way to travel.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.800
You better put on the lights.
I can't see what I'm doing.

41:15.890 --> 41:18.553
No lights. We don't want them
to know we're having a party.

41:18.643 --> 41:21.010
- But I might spill some.
- So spill it.

41:21.104 --> 41:24.347
Spills, thrills, laughs, and games.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.853
This may even turn out to be
a surprise party.

41:26.943 --> 41:29.560
- What's the surprise?
- Uh-huh. Not yet.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.522
- When?
- Better have a drink first.

41:32.615 --> 41:35.198
- That'll put hair on your chest.
- No fair guessing.

41:38.079 --> 41:39.839
This a private clambake,
or can anybody join?

41:39.914 --> 41:41.871
Yes, it's private.
Please, go away.

41:41.958 --> 41:44.325
Dolores, do you still have
that bottle of vermouth?

41:44.419 --> 41:46.160
- Sure.
- Who needs vermouth?

41:46.254 --> 41:48.587
We've got bourbon.
We could make manhattans.

41:48.673 --> 41:51.586
- Okay.
- Manhattans? At this time of night?

41:51.676 --> 41:54.293
- Bring the cocktail shaker.
- Oh, Sugar!

41:54.387 --> 41:56.470
You're gonna spoil my surprise.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.511
- Hey, honey, what's up?
- Party in Upper 7.

42:00.601 --> 42:02.513
A party?
I'll get some cheese and crackers.

42:02.603 --> 42:04.890
- I'll get a cocktail shaker, you get a corkscrew.
- Okay.

42:04.981 --> 42:07.223
- Hey, Rosella, there's a party in Upper 7.
- Yeah?

42:07.316 --> 42:09.228
- You got a corkscrew?
- No. But Stella has.

42:09.318 --> 42:11.401
- Well, go get some paper cups.
- Okay.

42:11.988 --> 42:14.901
- Hey, there's a party in Upper 7.
- Party in Upper 7.

42:14.991 --> 42:18.234
Party in Upper 7!

42:19.662 --> 42:22.575
- Here's the vermouth.
- This is a private party. Please go away.

42:22.665 --> 42:25.533
I brought some cheese and crackers
in case anybody gets hungry.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.538
- What is this?
- Will ten cups be enough?

42:27.628 --> 42:30.371
A party for two! Two!
Ten cups? What is...

42:30.465 --> 42:33.629
Please, girls. Please stop this.

42:33.718 --> 42:36.335
- Could you use some Southern Comfort?
- Southern Com... Shh!

42:36.429 --> 42:40.013
Girls, you're gonna wake up
the neighbors downstairs... Josephine.

42:40.099 --> 42:42.261
Watch that corkscrew!

42:42.351 --> 42:44.809
- Here's a cracker.
- Will you... No crackers in bed!

42:45.772 --> 42:48.310
Will you girls go away
and form your own party?

42:48.399 --> 42:50.140
Here's the cocktail shaker.

42:50.234 --> 42:51.770
I wish we had some ice.

42:51.861 --> 42:53.898
Hey, easy on the vermouth.

42:53.988 --> 42:56.605
Thirteen girls in a berth. It's bad luck.

42:56.699 --> 42:59.261
- Twelve of you will have to get out.
- Pass me the peanut butter.

42:59.285 --> 43:01.698
- Anyone for salami?
- Mmm!

43:01.788 --> 43:04.155
No more food.
I'll have ants in the morning.

43:05.666 --> 43:06.665
- Hey.
- Hmm?

43:06.667 --> 43:09.080
- Have you got any maraschino cherries on you?
- Mmm?

43:09.170 --> 43:10.661
Oh, never mind.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.507
Maraschino cherries?

43:28.898 --> 43:30.514
What's going on here?

43:30.608 --> 43:32.065
Daphne.

43:32.151 --> 43:34.268
Daphne, where are you? Daphne!

43:34.987 --> 43:37.695
It's not my fault. I didn't invite them.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.068
Come on, girls. Break it up.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.491
All right, you heard Josephine.

43:41.577 --> 43:44.240
Girls. Everybody out.
Everybody out!

43:45.248 --> 43:48.036
- Not you, Sugar.
- I'm just going to get some ice.

43:48.126 --> 43:50.118
Get out! Get out!

43:50.211 --> 43:52.999
That's right, Sugar.
All right, now the rest of you. Out.

43:53.089 --> 43:54.625
- Aw, don't be a flat tire.
- Shh!

43:54.715 --> 43:57.332
- Come on in. The water's fine.
- Have a manhattan.

43:57.426 --> 44:01.090
- Pipe down. We'll all be fired.
- Sugar, don't leave me here alone.

44:01.180 --> 44:02.762
Come on, please.
Give up, will ya.

44:02.849 --> 44:05.717
It's two o'clock.
You've had your fun. The party's over.

44:05.810 --> 44:07.802
Everybody go home.

44:07.895 --> 44:11.013
- What's this?
- Josephine. Over here, before it melts.

44:11.107 --> 44:13.520
Sugar!

44:18.156 --> 44:20.273
Put it here.

44:20.366 --> 44:22.779
Sugar, you're gonna get yourself
into a lot of trouble.

44:22.869 --> 44:26.328
- Yeah. You better keep a lookout.
- If Bienstock catches you again...

44:27.206 --> 44:29.323
What's the matter with you anyway?

44:29.417 --> 44:31.454
I'm not very bright, I guess.

44:31.544 --> 44:32.785
I wouldn't say that.

44:32.879 --> 44:34.791
- Careless, maybe.
- No, just dumb.

44:34.881 --> 44:38.875
If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on
this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.

44:38.968 --> 44:40.800
Well, why'd you take this job?

44:40.887 --> 44:43.675
I use to sing with male bands,
but I can't afford it anymore.

44:43.764 --> 44:46.427
Have you ever been with a male band?

44:46.517 --> 44:49.510
- Who? Me?
- That's what I'm running away from.

44:49.604 --> 44:53.314
I worked with six different ones
in the last two years. Oh, brother.

44:53.399 --> 44:55.186
- Rough?
- I'll say.

44:55.276 --> 44:58.485
- You can't trust those guys.
- I can't trust myself.

44:58.571 --> 45:01.154
I have this thing about saxophone players.

45:01.240 --> 45:03.482
Especially tenor sax.

45:04.702 --> 45:05.783
Really?

45:05.870 --> 45:08.704
I don't know what it is,
but they just curdle me.

45:08.789 --> 45:12.203
All they have to do is play eight bars
of "Come to Me, My Melancholy Baby"

45:12.293 --> 45:13.875
and my spine turns to custard.

45:13.961 --> 45:16.374
I get goose-pimply all over,
and I come to 'em.

45:16.464 --> 45:18.626
- That so?
- Every time.

45:20.343 --> 45:22.585
You know, I play tenor sax.

45:22.678 --> 45:25.421
- But you're a girl, thank goodness.
- Oh. Yeah.

45:25.514 --> 45:27.597
That's why I joined this band.
Safety first.

45:27.683 --> 45:30.050
Anything to get away from those bums.

45:30.144 --> 45:31.260
Yeah.

45:31.354 --> 45:32.674
You don't know what they're like.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.346
You fall for 'em, you really love 'em.

45:34.440 --> 45:37.774
You think this is gonna be
the biggest thing since the <i>Graf Zeppelin.</i>

45:37.860 --> 45:40.147
The next thing you know,
they're borrowing money from you,

45:40.238 --> 45:42.946
they're spending it on other dames
and betting on horses.

45:43.532 --> 45:44.648
You don't say.

45:44.742 --> 45:48.281
Then one morning you wake up,
the guy's gone, the saxophone's gone.

45:48.371 --> 45:53.207
All that's left behind is a pair of old socks
and a tube of toothpaste, all squeezed out.

45:53.292 --> 45:55.033
So you pull yourself together,

45:55.127 --> 45:57.915
you go on to the next job,
the next saxophone player.

45:58.005 --> 46:00.167
It's the same thing all over again.

46:00.258 --> 46:01.999
You see what I mean?

46:02.093 --> 46:04.085
Not very bright.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.386
Brains aren't everything.

46:06.973 --> 46:10.557
I can tell you one thing.
It's not gonna happen to me again, ever.

46:10.643 --> 46:13.761
I'm tired of getting
the fuzzy end of the lollipop.

46:13.854 --> 46:16.892
Ice. What's keeping the ice?
The natives are getting restless.

46:18.192 --> 46:20.605
- How about a couple of drinks for us? Hmm?
- Sure.

46:22.196 --> 46:25.189
- You know, I'm gonna be 25 in June.
- You are?

46:25.283 --> 46:28.117
That's a quarter of a century.
Makes a girl think.

46:28.202 --> 46:30.194
- About what?
- About the future.

46:30.288 --> 46:33.497
You know, like a husband.
That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.

46:33.582 --> 46:36.996
- What's in Florida?
- Millionaires. Flocks of them.

46:37.086 --> 46:39.453
They all go south for the winter,
like birds.

46:39.547 --> 46:41.459
Oh, you're gonna catch yourself
a rich bird?

46:41.549 --> 46:44.292
I don't care how rich he is
as long as he has a yacht,

46:44.385 --> 46:47.219
his own private railroad car
and his own toothpaste.

46:47.305 --> 46:49.718
- You're entitled.
- Maybe you'll meet one too, Josephine.

46:51.017 --> 46:54.306
With money like Rockefeller
and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller.

46:54.395 --> 46:57.388
- Oh, I want mine to wear glasses.
- Glasses?

46:57.481 --> 47:01.350
Men who wear glasses are so much
more gentle and sweet and helpless.

47:01.444 --> 47:03.185
Haven't you ever noticed it?

47:03.279 --> 47:04.756
Now that you've mentioned it, mm-hmm.

47:04.780 --> 47:06.692
They get those weak eyes from reading.

47:06.782 --> 47:11.277
You know, those long, tiny little columns
in <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>

47:12.246 --> 47:15.739
That bass fiddle,
she sure knows how to throw a party.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.620
Hot diggetty dog!

47:19.128 --> 47:20.664
Well, happy days!

47:21.714 --> 47:25.549
I hope this time you wind up
with the sweet end of the lollipop.

47:29.305 --> 47:31.672
So the one-legged jockey said...

47:31.766 --> 47:33.382
What did he say?

47:33.476 --> 47:37.140
So the one-legged jockey said,
"Don't worry about me, baby.

47:37.229 --> 47:38.970
I ride side-saddle."

47:41.525 --> 47:43.562
Oh! Shh.

47:46.405 --> 47:48.442
Terribly sorry. I seem to have hiccups.

47:48.532 --> 47:50.444
Hey, let's rub some ice on her neck.

47:50.534 --> 47:52.196
I think... I told you...

47:52.286 --> 47:54.949
Oh! You dropped it! Oh, it's cold!

47:55.039 --> 47:57.747
- Oh, no, please. Oh, don't do that!
- She's ticklish!

47:57.833 --> 48:00.312
Don't! Oh, please, no! Not the chest!

48:03.756 --> 48:06.715
Help! Help! Josephine!

48:06.801 --> 48:09.464
Please stop that! Stop that!

48:09.553 --> 48:11.260
Stop that!

48:20.940 --> 48:23.023
- What's happened?
- Search me.

48:23.109 --> 48:25.726
Uh, I mean... I mean, I'll see.

48:35.996 --> 48:38.158
All right, what's goin' on around here?

48:38.249 --> 48:39.865
Bienstock!

48:41.252 --> 48:42.914
A-Are we in Florida?

48:43.754 --> 48:46.337
<i>♪ Down among the sheltering palms ♪</i>

48:46.424 --> 48:49.588

49:28.549 --> 49:30.836
Sugar? Here.

49:30.926 --> 49:33.464
- I'll carry the instruments.
- Oh, thank you, Daphne.

49:33.554 --> 49:36.422
Oh, thank you, Daphne.
Isn't she a sweetheart?

49:41.770 --> 49:43.432
Good morning.

49:43.522 --> 49:45.229
How do you do?

49:48.652 --> 49:49.893
Zowie!

49:49.987 --> 49:51.398
Well, there they are.

49:51.489 --> 49:53.606
More millionaires
than you can shake a stick at.

49:53.699 --> 49:55.656
I'll bet there isn't one under 75.

49:55.743 --> 49:57.663
Seventy-five.
That's three-quarters of a century.

49:57.745 --> 49:59.156
Makes a girl think.

49:59.246 --> 50:01.158
Let's hope they brought
their grandsons along.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.615
Yes. Mm-hmm.

50:12.676 --> 50:14.167
Oh, pardon me, miss.

50:16.514 --> 50:18.255
- May I?
- Help yourself.

50:18.891 --> 50:21.349
I'm Osgood Fielding the Third.

50:21.435 --> 50:23.552
I'm Cinderella the second.

50:23.646 --> 50:27.390
If there's one thing I admire,
it's a girl with a shapely ankle.

50:28.400 --> 50:30.232
Me too. Bye-bye.

50:31.487 --> 50:34.730
- Let me carry one of the instruments.
- Oh, thank you.

50:34.823 --> 50:36.985
Aren't you a sweetheart?

50:42.206 --> 50:44.619
Certainly is delightful
having young blood around here.

50:44.708 --> 50:46.950
Oh. Well, personally, I'm type "O."

50:47.044 --> 50:49.536
You know, I've always been
fascinated by show business.

50:49.630 --> 50:51.417
- Is that so?
- Yes.

50:51.507 --> 50:54.545
As a matter of fact,
it's cost my family quite a bit of money.

50:54.635 --> 50:55.967
Oh, you invest in shows?

50:56.053 --> 50:57.715
Showgirls.

50:57.805 --> 50:59.421
I've been married seven or eight times.

50:59.515 --> 51:02.599
- You're not sure?
- Mama is keeping score.

51:02.685 --> 51:04.597
Frankly, she's getting
rather annoyed with me.

51:04.687 --> 51:05.973
I wouldn't wonder.

51:06.063 --> 51:08.146
So, this year, when
the <i>George White Scandals</i> opened,

51:08.232 --> 51:09.564
she packed me off to Florida.

51:09.650 --> 51:12.393
Right now, she thinks I'm out there
on my yacht...

51:12.486 --> 51:14.443
deep-sea fishing.

51:15.197 --> 51:17.610
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding.

51:17.700 --> 51:19.692
You're barking up the wrong fish.

51:20.411 --> 51:24.200
Well, if I promise not to be a naughty boy,
how about dinner tonight?

51:24.290 --> 51:26.156
I'm sorry. I'll be on the bandstand.

51:26.250 --> 51:27.582
Oh, of course.

51:27.668 --> 51:30.081
- Which of these instruments do you play?
- Bull fiddle.

51:30.170 --> 51:34.005
Fascinating.
Do you use a bow, or do you just pluck it?

51:35.050 --> 51:37.292
Most of the time I slap it.

51:38.804 --> 51:41.342
- You must be quite a girl.
- Wanna bet?

51:42.850 --> 51:44.762
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer.

51:44.852 --> 51:46.764
- You know, a sort of a contortionist.
- Mmm.

51:46.854 --> 51:49.517
She could smoke a cigarette
while holding it between her toes.

51:50.357 --> 51:51.689
Zowie!

51:51.775 --> 51:54.188
- But Mama broke it up.
- Why?

51:54.278 --> 51:56.270
She doesn't approve of girls who smoke.

51:58.449 --> 51:59.906
Bye-bye, Mr. Fielding.

51:59.992 --> 52:01.904
- Bye-bye?
- This is where I get off.

52:01.994 --> 52:03.860
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

52:03.954 --> 52:06.071
You don't get off that easy.

52:06.165 --> 52:08.748
All right, driver.
Once around the park. Slowly.

52:08.834 --> 52:10.826
And keep your eyes on the road.

52:20.929 --> 52:23.546
What kind of a girl
do you think I am, Mr. Fielding?

52:24.850 --> 52:26.386
Oh, oh, please. Please.

52:26.477 --> 52:28.184
- It won't happen again.
- I'll say!

52:28.270 --> 52:30.637
- Please come back.
- I'll walk, thank you.

52:30.731 --> 52:32.438
Oh, please, miss, I...

52:35.611 --> 52:37.352
Zowie!

52:37.446 --> 52:39.733
All right, girls.
Here are your room assignments.

52:40.366 --> 52:42.983
My glasses. Where are my glasses?

52:44.244 --> 52:46.201
- Olga and Mary Lou are in 412.
- Excuse me.

52:46.330 --> 52:49.142
And Mary Lou, will you keep your kimono buttoned
when you ring for room service.

52:49.166 --> 52:50.165
Well!

52:50.167 --> 52:52.250
- Josephine and Daphne are in 413.
- Thank you.

52:52.336 --> 52:55.374
- Dolores and Sugar in 414.
- Me and Sugar?

52:55.464 --> 52:58.002
Well, what did you expect,
a one-legged jockey?

52:58.092 --> 53:00.550
Rosella and Emily in 415.
Stella and...

53:00.636 --> 53:03.219
- I wish they'd put us in the same room.
- So do I.

53:03.305 --> 53:06.639
But don't worry about it, Sugar.
We'll see a lot of each other.

53:07.893 --> 53:09.976
414.

53:10.062 --> 53:12.475
That's the same room number
I had in Cincinnati,

53:12.564 --> 53:14.897
my last time around with a male band.

53:14.983 --> 53:16.690
What a heel he was.

53:16.777 --> 53:18.484
- Saxophone player?
- What else?

53:18.570 --> 53:20.357
Was I ever crazy about him.

53:20.447 --> 53:23.611
2:00 in the morning he sent me down
for hot dogs and potato salad.

53:23.701 --> 53:26.364
They were out of potato salad,
so I brought coleslaw.

53:26.453 --> 53:28.365
So he threw it right in my face.

53:28.455 --> 53:30.412
Forget it, Sugar.
Forget saxophone players.

53:30.499 --> 53:33.037
You're gonna meet a millionaire.
A young one.

53:33.127 --> 53:36.291
- What makes you so sure?
- My feminine intuition.

53:44.888 --> 53:47.255
- Oh, are these your bags?
- Mm-hmm.

53:48.350 --> 53:51.093
- And that one too.
- Okay, doll.

53:52.396 --> 53:54.308
I suppose you want a tip?

53:54.398 --> 53:57.641
Ah, forget it, doll.
After all, you work here, and I work here.

53:57.735 --> 54:01.103
And believe you me, it's nice to
have you with the organization.

54:01.196 --> 54:03.108
- Bye-bye.
- Uh, listen, doll.

54:03.198 --> 54:05.360
What time do you get off tonight?

54:05.451 --> 54:06.487
Why?

54:06.577 --> 54:09.497
Well, I'm workin' the night shift,
and I got a bottle of gin stashed away,

54:09.580 --> 54:10.991
and when there's a lull...

54:11.081 --> 54:13.539
Don't you think
you're a little young for that, sonny?

54:13.625 --> 54:16.993
Oh, you wanna see
my, uh, driver's license?

54:18.130 --> 54:19.496
Get lost, will ya.

54:19.590 --> 54:22.674
That's the way I like 'em...
big and sassy.

54:23.927 --> 54:26.089
Oh, and, uh, get rid of your roommate.

54:41.779 --> 54:43.441
- Dirty old man!
- What happened?

54:43.530 --> 54:45.442
I just got pinched in the elevator.

54:45.532 --> 54:48.386
- Well, now you know how the other half lives.
- Look at that! I'm not even pretty.

54:48.410 --> 54:50.618
They don't care,
just so long as you're wearing a skirt.

54:50.704 --> 54:54.100
- It's like waving a red flag in front of a bull.
- Really? Well, I'm sick of being the flag.

54:54.124 --> 54:57.061
I want to be a bull again. What do you say?
Let's get outta here. Let's blow.

54:57.085 --> 54:58.084
Blow where?

54:58.086 --> 55:01.329
You promised me, Joe, that the minute
we hit Florida, we were gonna beat it.

55:01.423 --> 55:05.588
- How can we? We're broke.
- We could find another band. A male band.

55:05.677 --> 55:08.636
Look, stupid, right now
Spats Colombo and his chums

55:08.722 --> 55:10.802
are looking for us
in every male band in the country.

55:10.849 --> 55:14.037
- It's so humiliating, the whole...
- So you got pinched in the elevator. So what?

55:14.061 --> 55:16.039
Would you rather be
picking lead out of your navel?

55:16.063 --> 55:19.056
All right, all right. But how long
do you think we can keep this up?

55:19.149 --> 55:20.481
What's the beef?

55:20.567 --> 55:21.774
- We're sittin' pretty.
- Huh?

55:21.860 --> 55:24.398
Look. We get room and board.
We're getting paid every week.

55:24.488 --> 55:27.902
Look.
Look at the palm trees, the flying fish.

55:27.991 --> 55:30.108
What are you giving me
with the flying fish?

55:30.202 --> 55:32.785
I know why you want to stay here.
You're after Sugar.

55:32.871 --> 55:34.112
Me? After Sugar?

55:34.206 --> 55:38.075
I saw the both of you on that bus,
all lovey-dovey and whispering and giggling

55:38.168 --> 55:39.955
and borrowing each other's lipstick!

55:40.045 --> 55:42.412
- What are you talking about? Me and Sugar?
- You and Sugar.

55:42.506 --> 55:44.122
We're just like sisters.

55:44.216 --> 55:48.381
Well, I'm your fairy godmother,
and I'm gonna keep an eye on you.

55:49.972 --> 55:51.588
Are you decent?

55:56.937 --> 55:58.144
Come in.

55:59.815 --> 56:02.432
You girls seen a brown bag
with a white stripe and my initials?

56:02.526 --> 56:04.813
- A what?
- My suitcase with all my resort clothes.

56:04.903 --> 56:07.441
- No, we haven't.
- Can't understand it.

56:07.531 --> 56:10.239
First my glasses disappear,
then one of my suitcases.

56:10.325 --> 56:12.191
- Where's my ukulele?
- Now a ukulele.

56:12.286 --> 56:14.152
There must be a sneak thief
around here.

56:14.246 --> 56:16.909
Oh! Here it is. Hi, Sug.

56:16.999 --> 56:19.394
A bunch of us girls are gonna go for a swim.
You want to come along?

56:19.418 --> 56:22.081
- A swim? Oh, you betcha.
- Just a minute, Daphne.

56:22.170 --> 56:25.584
- You haven't got a bathing suit.
- She doesn't need one. I don't have one either.

56:25.674 --> 56:27.586
Ah! See?
She doesn't have one either.

56:27.676 --> 56:29.596
- You don't?
- We can rent some at the bathhouse.

56:29.678 --> 56:31.465
- How about you, Josephine?
- No, thanks.

56:31.555 --> 56:33.467
I think I'll stay in
and soak in a hot tub.

56:33.557 --> 56:36.470
- On a day like this? It's lovely out.
- Yeah, well, let her soak.

56:36.560 --> 56:37.846
Come on.

56:37.936 --> 56:39.552
Don't get burned, Daphne.

56:39.646 --> 56:41.638
- Oh, I've got suntan lotion.
- Well, see?

56:41.732 --> 56:44.850
She'll rub it on me, I'll rub it on her,
and we'll rub it on each other.

56:44.943 --> 56:46.434
Bye-bye.

Daphne, cut it out!

57:51.218 --> 57:54.552
- What do you think you're doing?
- Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.

57:54.638 --> 57:58.348
Whoo, look out!
Here comes a big one!

57:58.433 --> 58:00.299
Whee!

58:29.464 --> 58:32.252
Daphne, I had no idea
you were such a big girl.

58:32.342 --> 58:35.176
Oh, Sugar, you should've seen me
before I went on a diet.

58:35.262 --> 58:36.924
I mean, your shoulders
and your arms.

58:37.014 --> 58:39.848
Oh, well, that's from carrying
that bull fiddle around all day.

58:39.933 --> 58:42.300
- Oh, there's one thing I envy you for.
- What's that?

58:42.394 --> 58:44.010
You're so flat-chested.

58:44.646 --> 58:46.979
Clothes hang better on you
than they do on me.

58:47.691 --> 58:49.227
Watch out, Daphne!

58:50.027 --> 58:52.360
- Sugar, come on! Let's play ball!
- Okay!

58:53.905 --> 58:57.239
- Let's go, Junior. Time for your nap.
- No. I wanna play.

58:58.118 --> 59:00.360
You heard your mother, Junior.
Scram.

59:00.454 --> 59:03.242
This beach ain't big enough
for the both of us. Get outta here.

59:03.331 --> 59:05.664
Mommy! Mommy!

59:05.751 --> 59:07.208
Now, here we go.

59:07.294 --> 59:10.253
I like coffee, I like tea!

59:10.338 --> 59:14.423
How many boys are stuck on me?

59:14.509 --> 59:17.627
One! Two! Three!

59:17.721 --> 59:20.134
Four! Five! Six!

59:26.730 --> 59:28.833
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- My fault.

59:28.857 --> 59:30.334
- You're not hurt, are you?
- I don't think so.

59:30.358 --> 59:32.315
- I wish you'd make sure.
- Why?

59:32.402 --> 59:34.359
Because usually
when people find out who I am,

59:34.446 --> 59:36.483
they get themselves a wheelchair,
a shyster lawyer,

59:36.573 --> 59:38.940
and sue me for
three-quarters of a million dollars.

59:39.743 --> 59:42.076
Don't worry. I won't sue you,
no matter who you are.

59:42.162 --> 59:43.369
Thank you.

59:45.373 --> 59:46.705
Who are you?

59:46.792 --> 59:48.033
Now, really!

59:49.795 --> 59:51.457
Sugar!

59:52.005 --> 59:53.712
Come on!

59:53.799 --> 59:55.085
Honestly.

59:56.426 --> 59:57.633
Cheerio.

01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:06.218
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Not very likely.

01:00:06.311 --> 01:00:08.428
- You staying at the hotel?
- Not at all.

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:10.896
Your face is familiar.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:13.315
Possible you've seen it
in the newspapers or magazines.

01:00:13.401 --> 01:00:15.017
Um, <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:16.944
That must be it.

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:20.398
Would you mind moving just a little, please?
You're blocking my view.

01:00:20.492 --> 01:00:21.733
Your view? Of what?

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:25.286
They run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht
when it's time for cocktails.

01:00:25.956 --> 01:00:27.697
You own a yacht?

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:29.956
Which one is it?

01:00:30.043 --> 01:00:32.410
- The big one?
- Certainly not.

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:33.995
With all the unrest in the world,

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:36.729
I don't think anybody should have
a yacht that sleeps more than 12.

01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:39.674
I quite agree.

01:00:39.761 --> 01:00:41.969
Tell me, who runs up that flag?

01:00:42.055 --> 01:00:44.092
- Your wife?
- No. My flag steward.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:47.471
Who mixes the cocktails? Your wife?

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:50.303
No, my cocktail steward.

01:00:50.397 --> 01:00:52.980
Look, if you're interested
in whether I am married or not...

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:54.728
Oh, I'm not interested at all.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:55.899
Well, I'm not.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:58.186
That's very interesting.

01:01:02.075 --> 01:01:04.658
- How's the stock market?
- Up, up, up.

01:01:04.744 --> 01:01:07.557
I'll bet, while we were talking,
you made, like, a hundred thousand dollars?

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:09.664
Could be. Uh, you play the market?

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:11.832
No. The ukulele. And I sing too.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:13.250
For your own amusement?

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:17.171
A bunch of us girls are appearing at the hotel.
Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators.

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:18.964
Oh, you're society girls.

01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:22.043
Oh, yes. Quite.
You know, Bryn Mawr, Vassar.

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:24.254
We're just doing this for a lark.

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:25.633
Syncopators.

01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:29.013
Does that mean you play
that very fast music... uh, jazz?

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:31.810
Yeah! Real hot.

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:35.516
Oh, well, I guess some like it hot.
I personally prefer classical music.

01:01:36.401 --> 01:01:38.233
Oh, I do too. As a matter of fact,

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:41.609
I spent three years
at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music.

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:44.194
Good school.

01:01:44.284 --> 01:01:46.526
And your family
doesn't object to your career?

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.829
They do indeed. Daddy threatened
to cut me off without a cent.

01:01:49.915 --> 01:01:51.907
But I don't care.
It was such a bore, you know.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.037
- Coming-out parties.
- Inauguration balls.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:56.494
- Opening of the opera.
- Riding to hounds.

01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:59.501
And always the same Four Hundred.

01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:02.550
You know, it's amazing we never
ran into each other before.

01:02:02.636 --> 01:02:05.595
I'm sure I would have remembered
anybody as attractive as you are.

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.796
- You're very kind.
- Hmm.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.633
I'll bet you're also gentle and helpless.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.137
I beg your pardon.

01:02:11.228 --> 01:02:13.641
You see, I have this theory
about men who wear glasses.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:16.814
- What theory?
- I'll tell you when I get to know you better.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.607
What are you doing tonight?

01:02:18.693 --> 01:02:19.979
Uh, tonight?

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.483
I thought maybe you could come
to the hotel and hear us play.

01:02:22.572 --> 01:02:25.440
Uh, I would like to,
but that would be rather difficult.

01:02:25.533 --> 01:02:26.533
Why?

01:02:26.618 --> 01:02:29.031
I only come ashore twice a day,
when the tide goes out.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.362
- Oh.
- It's on account of these shells.

01:02:31.456 --> 01:02:32.947
That's my hobby.

01:02:33.041 --> 01:02:34.282
- You collect shells?
- Yes.

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:38.416
So did my father and my grandfather.
You might say we had a passion for shells.

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.997
That's why we named
the oil company after it.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:43.878
Shell Oil?

01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:45.835
Please, no names.

01:02:45.929 --> 01:02:47.340
Just call me Junior.

01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.969
Sugar! Sugar! Come on, dear.
It's time to change for dinner.

01:02:51.059 --> 01:02:53.221
Run along, Daphne, dear.
I'll catch up with you later.

01:02:53.311 --> 01:02:54.802
Oh. Okay.

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:06.193
- No!
- What is it, young lady?

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:09.651
What are you staring at?
This happens to me all the time in public.

01:03:09.744 --> 01:03:12.236
I recognized him too.
His picture was in <i>Vanity Fair.</i>

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:15.118
<i>- Vanity Fair</i> ?
- Would you mind moving along, please?

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:18.497
Yes, you're in his way.
He's waiting for a signal from his yacht.

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:20.461
His yacht?

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:23.669
It sleeps 12.
This is my friend, Daphne.

01:03:23.758 --> 01:03:26.296
- She's a Vassar girl.
- I'm a what?

01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:28.298
Or was it Bryn Mawr?

01:03:30.432 --> 01:03:33.891
I heard a very sad story
about a girl who went to Bryn Mawr.

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.684
She squealed on her roommate,

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:38.137
and they found her strangled
with her own brassiere.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:43.564
Yes. We have to be very careful
whom we pick for a roommate, hmm?

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:46.145
Well, I think I better be going.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:48.697
It was delightful meeting you both.

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:51.696
- You will come and hear us play?
- If it's at all possible.

01:03:51.786 --> 01:03:54.403
Oh, do come. Don't disappoint us.
It'll be such fun.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:57.205
- And bring your yacht!
- Come on, Daphne.

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.042
How about that guy?

01:04:05.133 --> 01:04:07.716
Now look, Daphne.
Hands off. I saw him first.

01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:09.488
Sugar, let me give you a little advice, dear.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:12.971
If I were a girl, and I am,
I'd watch my step.

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:15.596
If I'd been watching my step,
I never would have met him.

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.517
I can't wait to tell Josephine.

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:19.766
Yeah. Josephine.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:22.473
I can't wait to see her face.
Will she be surprised.

01:04:22.567 --> 01:04:25.150
Neither can I! Let's run up
to the room and tell her right now.

01:04:25.236 --> 01:04:27.853
- Oh, we don't have to run.
- Oh, yes, we do.

01:04:36.498 --> 01:04:39.366
Josephine! Yoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:42.202
- I guess she's not here.
- Isn't that funny? Josie!

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.252
I can't imagine where she'd be.

01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:46.296
- Well, I'll be back later.
- Oh, no. You wait.

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:48.591
I have a feeling
she'll show up any minute.

01:04:48.676 --> 01:04:51.043
Believe it or not,
Josephine predicted the whole thing.

01:04:51.137 --> 01:04:53.129
Yeah. This is one for Ripley.

01:04:53.223 --> 01:04:55.931
- Do you suppose she went shopping?
- Shopping! That's it.

01:04:56.017 --> 01:04:59.306
Something tells me she's gonna come
through that door in a brand-new outfit.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:27.371
- Have a good time, girls?
- Oh, Josephine.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:29.798
- The most wonderful thing happened.
- What?

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:32.342
- Guess.
- They repealed Prohibition?

01:05:32.429 --> 01:05:35.467
Oh, come now. You can do better than that.

01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:38.345
- I met one of them.
- One of whom?

01:05:38.435 --> 01:05:42.349
Shell Oil Junior. He's got millions,
he's got glasses, he's got a yacht.

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:43.646
You don't say.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:46.144
He's not only got a yacht,
he's got a bicycle.

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:48.021
Daphne.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:50.478
Go on, tell me all about him.

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:53.610
Well, he's young and he's handsome.
He's a bachelor.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.657
He's a real gentleman.

01:05:55.743 --> 01:05:58.326
You know, not one of these grabbers.

01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:00.996
Maybe you better go after him
if you don't want to lose him.

01:06:01.082 --> 01:06:03.870
Well, I'm not gonna let this one get away.
He's so cute.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.874
- He collects shells.
- Shells? Hmm. Whatever for?

01:06:07.964 --> 01:06:11.048
Oh, you know. The old shell game.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:13.000
Daphne, you're bothering us.

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:15.552
- Anyway, you're going to meet him tonight.
- I am?

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.176
He said he's gonna come to hear us play,
maybe.

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:21.509
What do you mean, maybe?
I saw the way he looked at you.

01:06:21.603 --> 01:06:24.061
- He'll be there for sure.
- I hope so.

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:28.187
What do you think, Josephine?
What does it say in your crystal ball?

01:06:28.276 --> 01:06:31.064
Sugar! Hey, is Sugar in here?

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:33.146
- Yes.
- Sugar, have you got the key?

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:36.198
I'm locked out,
and I'm makin' a puddle in the hall.

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:38.571
See you on the bandstand, girls.

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:45.958
What are you trying to do to that poor girl?
Puttin' on a millionaire act.

01:06:46.044 --> 01:06:50.288
And where did you get that phony accent?
Nobody talks like that.

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:52.498
Oh, I've seen you pull
some low tricks on women.

01:06:52.592 --> 01:06:56.006
This is, without doubt,
the trickiest, lowest, and meanest...

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:05.015
I'm not afraid of you.

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:08.518
I'm thin, but I'm wiry.

01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:11.897
Now, Joe, you're gonna get hurt
because when I'm aroused, I'm a tiger.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:15.696
Why, Joe! Don't look at me like that,
when it was all a joke.

01:07:15.782 --> 01:07:17.648
When I didn't mean any harm.

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:19.970
Well, I'm gonna press the suit myself.

01:07:19.994 --> 01:07:23.408
Telephone! Answer the tele... phone.

01:07:27.669 --> 01:07:29.501
Hello. Hello.

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.462
Yes, this is 413.

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:36.500
Ship-to-shore? All right, I'll take it.

01:07:36.594 --> 01:07:39.177
Hello, Daphne.
It's that naughty boy again.

01:07:39.264 --> 01:07:41.631
You know, Osgood. In the elevator?

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.932
You slapped my face.

01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:48.470
- Who is this?
- This is her roommate.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:50.932
Daphne can't talk right now.
Is it anything urgent?

01:07:51.025 --> 01:07:53.438
Well, it is to me.
Will you give her a message?

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:58.148
Tell her I'd like her to have a little supper
with me on my yacht, after the show tonight.

01:07:58.241 --> 01:08:01.655
Got it. Supper, yacht, after the show.
I'll tell her.

01:08:01.744 --> 01:08:04.452
- Your yacht?
<i>- The New Caledonia.</i>

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:05.746
That's the name of it.

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:10.167
<i>The Old Caledonia</i> went down
during a wild party off Cape Hatteras.

01:08:10.253 --> 01:08:13.792
But tell her not to worry.
This will be a quiet little midnight snack.

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:16.544
Just the two of us.

01:08:16.634 --> 01:08:20.298
Just the two of you? What about the crew?

01:08:20.388 --> 01:08:23.881
Oh, that's all been taken care of.
I'm giving them shore leave.

01:08:24.892 --> 01:08:26.929
We'll have a little cold pheasant
and champagne.

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:28.540
And I've checked with the Coast Guard.

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:31.096
There's gonna be a full moon tonight.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:35.810
Oh, and tell her I've got a new batch
of Rudy Vallee records.

01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:41.198
That's good thinking.
Daphne's a pushover for him.

01:08:41.283 --> 01:08:43.116
Pushover for who?
Why... Who's on the...

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:45.158
Shh! Yes, Mr. Fielding.

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:48.580
You'll pick her up after the show
in your motorboat.

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:50.157
Good-bye.

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:51.957
What's that you said?

01:08:52.045 --> 01:08:53.786
Oh. Zowie.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.292
- I'll give her the message.
- What message? What motorboat?

01:08:56.381 --> 01:08:57.747
You got it made, kid.

01:08:57.841 --> 01:09:00.487
Fielding wants to have a little cold pheasant
with you on his yacht.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:03.379
- He does?
- Just the three of you on that great big boat.

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.715
- You and him and Rudy Vallee.
- Well, fat chance.

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.537
- Call him back and tell him I'm not going.
- Well, of course you're not.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.051
- Oh.
- I'm going.

01:09:12.106 --> 01:09:14.689
You're gonna be on the boat
with that dirty old man?

01:09:14.776 --> 01:09:17.314
No. I'm going to be on the boat with Sugar.

01:09:17.403 --> 01:09:20.237
- Well, where's he gonna be?
- He's gonna be ashore with you.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:21.814
- With me?
- That's right.

01:09:21.908 --> 01:09:24.867

Daphne, your boyfriend's waving at you.

You can both go take a flyin' jump.

01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:48.950
Remember, he's your date for the night,
so smile.

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:55.411
Oh, you can do better than that.
Give him the teeth, the whole personality.

01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:08.045
Why do I let you
talk me into these things? Why?

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:11.007
Because we're pals, buddies.
The two musketeers.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:13.183
Don't give me with the musketeers.

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.010
How am I gonna keep the guy ashore?

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.938
Tell him you get seasick on a yacht.
Uh, play miniature golf with him.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:21.517
Oh, no. I'm not gonna get caught
in a miniature sand trap with that guy.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.533
Hi! Which of you dolls is Daphne?

01:11:29.619 --> 01:11:31.201
Bull fiddle.

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:33.779
It's from satchel mouth at table seven.

01:11:38.878 --> 01:11:41.541
This is from me to you, doll.

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:42.838
Beat it, buster.

01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:46.258
Never mind leaving your door open.
I got a passkey.

I guess he's not gonna show up.
It's five minutes to 1:00.

01:12:29.053 --> 01:12:30.385
Do you suppose he forgot?

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:32.713
Well, you know how those millionaires are.

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:34.844
These came for you.

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:36.425
For me?

01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:40.478
- It's Shell Oil!
- No!

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:42.147
Yes!

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:44.566
He wants me to have supper with him
on his yacht.

01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:47.315
- He's going to pick me up at the pier.
- No!

01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:49.488
- Yes!
- You heard her. Yes.

01:12:49.574 --> 01:12:51.190
Oh, Josephine, just imagine.

01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:54.368
Me, Sugar Kowalczyk, from Sandusky, Ohio,

01:12:54.453 --> 01:12:56.445
on a millionaire's yacht.

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:59.327
If my mother could only see me now.

01:13:01.502 --> 01:13:03.994
I hope my mother never finds out.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:06.750
Well, that's it for tonight, folks.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:08.753
This is Sweet Sue saying good night,

01:13:08.843 --> 01:13:11.256
reminding all you daddies out there

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:14.463
that every girl in my band is a virtuoso,

01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:17.049
and I intend to keep it that way.

01:13:23.441 --> 01:13:24.932
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:58.442
But it's such a waste.
A full moon, an empty yacht.

01:14:58.536 --> 01:15:00.823
- I'll throw up.
- Then let's go dancing.

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:03.016
There's a little roadhouse down the coast.
If we could...

01:15:07.712 --> 01:15:09.248
Well, I'll be.

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:11.580
- He does have a bicycle.
- Who?

01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.882
Hmm? About the roadhouse...

01:15:13.968 --> 01:15:17.257
Oh.
They have a Cuban band that's the berries.

01:15:17.346 --> 01:15:21.215
Let's go there.
Blindfold the orchestra and tango till dawn.

01:15:21.308 --> 01:15:23.095
You know something, Mr. Fielding?

01:15:23.185 --> 01:15:24.801
- What?
- You're dynamite.

01:15:25.813 --> 01:15:28.430
You're a pretty hot little firecracker
yourself.

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:22.401
Ahoy there.

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:26.287
Ahoy!

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.248
Been waiting long?

01:16:36.342 --> 01:16:38.755
It's not how long you wait.
It's who you're waiting for.

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:41.302
Thank you. And thank you for the flowers.

01:16:41.388 --> 01:16:43.508
I wanted them to fly some orchids
from our greenhouse,

01:16:43.599 --> 01:16:46.512
but unfortunately,
all of Long Island is fogged in.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.639
It's the thought that counts.

01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:49.936
Ah...

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:57.527
Hmm. I seem to be out of gas.

01:16:57.613 --> 01:17:01.197
It's sort of funny, you being out of gas.
I mean, Shell Oil and everything.

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:03.570
Mm-hmm. Oops. There.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:11.374
Uh... It seems to be stuck
in, uh... in reverse.

01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:16.251
Uh, I ju... I just got this motorboat.
It's an experimental model.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.502
It seems like they're on the wrong track.

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:21.551
Do you mind riding backwards?
It may take a little longer.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:24.129
It's not how long it takes.
It's who's taking you.

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:25.714
Hmm. Yes.

01:17:51.458 --> 01:17:54.166
It looked so small from the beach,
but when you're on it,

01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:56.586
it's more like a cruiser or a destroyer.

01:17:56.672 --> 01:17:59.380
It's just regulation size.
We have three like this.

01:17:59.466 --> 01:18:01.674
- Three?
- Yes. Mother keeps hers in Southampton.

01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:04.969
Daddy's got his in Venezuela.
The company is laying a new pipeline.

01:18:05.055 --> 01:18:07.593
My dad's more interested in railroads.
Baltimore and Ohio.

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:09.094
Hmm.

01:18:09.185 --> 01:18:11.222
Which is the port
and which is the starboard?

01:18:11.312 --> 01:18:12.553
Well, that depends.

01:18:12.646 --> 01:18:14.558
That depends on whether
you're coming or going.

01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:18.062
I mean, normally... normally the aft
is on the other side of the stern.

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:19.814
Th... And that's the bridge.

01:18:19.904 --> 01:18:23.318
So that you can get from one side
of the boat to the other.

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.865
- Would you like a glass of champagne?
- Love it.

01:18:25.951 --> 01:18:27.442
Which way?

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:31.662
Oh! You have an upstairs and a downstairs.

01:18:31.749 --> 01:18:33.741
Yes. That's the hurricane cellar.

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:39.287
And another nice thing about this yacht...
lots of closet space.

01:18:40.507 --> 01:18:44.296
Now, let me see. Where do you suppose
the steward set it up?

01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:48.922
In here!

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:52.551
Oh, yes, of course. How silly of me.

01:18:52.645 --> 01:18:55.558
On Thursdays,
they always serve me in the small salon.

01:19:04.782 --> 01:19:06.398
It's exquisite.

01:19:06.492 --> 01:19:08.154
Like a floating mansion.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:10.531
Well, it's all right for a bachelor.

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:12.946
What a beautiful fish!

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.906
I caught him off Cape Hatteras.

01:19:15.626 --> 01:19:17.117
What is it?

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:19.835
It's a member of the herring family.

01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:23.005
A herring?

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:28.546
Isn't it amazing how they get
those big fish into those little glass jars?

01:19:28.639 --> 01:19:30.756
They shrink when they're marinated.

01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:32.966
- Champagne?
- I don't mind if I do.

01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:35.803
Well, down the hatch, as we say at sea.

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:37.512
Bon voyage.

01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:44.778
- Look at all that silverware!
- Uh, trophies.

01:19:44.863 --> 01:19:48.573
You know, skeet shooting,
dog breeding, water polo.

01:19:48.659 --> 01:19:51.026
- Water polo? Isn't that terribly dangerous?
- I'll say.

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.487
I had two ponies drowned under me.

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.572
- Where's your shell collection?
- Mmm.

01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:58.079
Yes, of course.
Now, where could they have put it?

01:19:58.168 --> 01:20:00.706
You see, on Thursdays,
I'm sort of lost around here.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:03.163
- What's on Thursday?
- It's the crew's night off.

01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:06.086
You mean, we're alone on the boat?

01:20:06.176 --> 01:20:07.508
Completely.

01:20:07.594 --> 01:20:10.052
You know, I've never been
completely alone with a man before,

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:12.472
in the middle of the night,
in the middle of the ocean.

01:20:12.558 --> 01:20:15.175
Oh, it's perfectly safe.
We're well-anchored.

01:20:15.269 --> 01:20:17.010
Ship's in shipshape shape.

01:20:17.104 --> 01:20:20.024
And the Coast Guard promised to call me
if there were any icebergs around.

01:20:20.107 --> 01:20:21.939
It's not the icebergs.

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:25.485
But there are certain men who would try
to take advantage of a situation like this.

01:20:25.571 --> 01:20:27.403
You're flattering me.

01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:30.110
Of course, I'm sure you're a gentleman.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.989
Oh, it's not that.
It's, uh, just that I'm, um, harmless.

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:35.741
Harmless? How?

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:38.869
Well, I don't know how to put it,
but I've got this thing about girls.

01:20:38.959 --> 01:20:40.575
What thing?

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.956
They just sort of leave me cold.

01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:45.209
You mean, like frigid?

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:47.837
Well, it's more like, um, a mental block.

01:20:47.926 --> 01:20:50.634
When I'm with a girl,
it does absolutely nothing to me.

01:20:51.263 --> 01:20:53.380
- Have you tried?
- Have I?

01:20:53.474 --> 01:20:55.466
I'm trying all the time.

01:21:02.483 --> 01:21:04.691
See? Nothing.

01:21:05.277 --> 01:21:07.860
- Nothing at all?
- Complete washout.

01:21:07.946 --> 01:21:09.778
That makes me feel just awful.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.401
Oh, my dear, it's not your fault.

01:21:11.492 --> 01:21:14.429
It's just that every now and then,
Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve.

01:21:14.453 --> 01:21:16.740
Something goes wrong inside.

01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:19.743
- You mean, you can't fall in love?
- Not anymore.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:22.576
I was in love once,
but I would rather not talk about it.

01:21:22.669 --> 01:21:24.535
Would you like a little cold pheasant?

01:21:24.630 --> 01:21:26.121
What happened?

01:21:26.215 --> 01:21:29.379
- I don't want to bore you.
- Oh, you couldn't possibly.

01:21:29.468 --> 01:21:34.008
Well, it was my freshman year
at Princeton.

01:21:34.098 --> 01:21:36.215
There was this girl. Her name was Nellie.

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:39.016
Her father was the vice president
of Hupmobile.

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:41.095
She wore glasses too.

01:21:41.939 --> 01:21:44.477
That summer we spent our vacation
at the Grand Canyon.

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:47.354
We were standing on the highest ledge,
watching the sunset,

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:50.061
when suddenly we got this impulse to kiss.

01:21:50.155 --> 01:21:53.694
I took off my glasses.
She took off her glasses.

01:21:53.784 --> 01:21:57.277
I took a step toward her.
She took a step towards me.

01:21:57.371 --> 01:21:58.953
Oh, no!

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:00.405
Yes.

01:22:00.499 --> 01:22:03.583
Eight hours later,
they brought her up by mule.

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:07.583
I gave her three transfusions.
We had the same type blood. Type "O."

01:22:07.673 --> 01:22:09.289
But it was too late.

01:22:10.592 --> 01:22:12.629
Talk about sad.

01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:14.802
Ever since then...

01:22:14.888 --> 01:22:18.507
numb, no feelings,
like my heart was shot full of novocaine.

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.967
You poor, poor boy.

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:23.974
Yes. All the money in the world,
and what good is it?

01:22:24.064 --> 01:22:25.896
Mint sauce or cranberries?

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:29.935
How can you think about food
at a time like this?

01:22:30.028 --> 01:22:31.860
What else is there for me?

01:22:31.947 --> 01:22:35.486
- Is it that hopeless?
- My family did everything they could.

01:22:35.576 --> 01:22:38.444
Hired the most beautiful
French upstairs maids.

01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:41.780
Got a special tutor to read me all those books
that were banned in Boston.

01:22:41.874 --> 01:22:43.911
Imported a whole troupe
of Balinese dancers.

01:22:44.001 --> 01:22:47.620
You know, with those bells on their ankles
and those long fingernails.

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:50.421
What a waste of money.

01:22:50.507 --> 01:22:53.500
- Have you ever tried American girls?
- Why?

01:23:00.100 --> 01:23:02.092
Was that anything?

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:05.554
Thanks just the same.

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:08.398
You should see a doctor, a good doctor.

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:09.816
I have.

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:13.521
I spent six months in Vienna
with Professor Freud, flat on my back.

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:16.064
Then there were the Mayo Brothers...

01:23:16.158 --> 01:23:19.276
injections, hypnosis, uh, mineral baths.

01:23:19.369 --> 01:23:21.736
If I wasn't such a coward, I'd kill myself.

01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:25.407
Don't say that!

01:23:25.501 --> 01:23:27.914
There must be some girl someplace
that could...

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:32.293
If I ever found the girl that could,
I'd marry her just like that.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.338
- Would you do me a favor?
- Certainly. What is it?

01:23:36.428 --> 01:23:40.263
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo brother
or one of those French upstairs girls,

01:23:40.349 --> 01:23:43.262
but... could I take another crack at it?

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:45.806
All right. If you insist.

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:02.369
- Anything this time?
- I'm afraid not.

01:24:03.789 --> 01:24:05.075
Terribly sorry.

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:07.578
Would you like some more champagne?

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:12.996
Maybe if we had some music.
How do you dim these lights?

01:24:14.633 --> 01:24:18.126
Look, it's terribly sweet of you
to want to help out, but it's no use.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:20.758
I think the light switch is over there.

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:28.307
That's the radio.

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:32.016
It's like taking someone to a concert
when he's tone deaf.

01:25:08.228 --> 01:25:10.936
You're not giving yourself a chance.

01:25:11.023 --> 01:25:12.810
Don't fight it.

01:25:14.276 --> 01:25:16.984
Relax.

01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:32.208
It's like smoking without inhaling.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:34.035
So inhale.

01:25:57.235 --> 01:25:58.567
- Daphne.
- Hmm?

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:01.021
- You're leading again.
- Sorry.

01:26:15.504 --> 01:26:16.995
Well?

01:26:18.757 --> 01:26:20.965
I'm not quite sure.

01:26:21.051 --> 01:26:23.259
Would you try it again?

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:36.314
I got a funny sensation in my toes...

01:26:37.567 --> 01:26:41.060
like someone was barbecuing them
over a slow flame.

01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:44.689
Let's throw another log on the fire.

01:26:54.459 --> 01:26:56.872
I think you're on the right track.

01:26:58.046 --> 01:27:01.539
I must be.
Your glasses are beginning to steam up.

01:27:25.949 --> 01:27:28.657
I never knew it could be like this.

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.986
Thank you.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:35.619
They told me I was kaput, finished,
all washed up.

01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:39.077
And here you are making a chump
out of all those experts.

01:27:41.882 --> 01:27:44.340
Mineral baths. Now, really.

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:47.043
Where did you learn to kiss like that?

01:27:47.888 --> 01:27:50.631
I use to sell kisses for the Milk Fund.

01:28:00.901 --> 01:28:04.394
Tomorrow, remind me to send a check
for a hundred thousand dollars

01:28:04.488 --> 01:28:06.480
to the Milk Fund.

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:36.350
<i>¡Olé!</i>

01:29:11.388 --> 01:29:13.675
Whoops. Oh.

01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:42.207
Good night.

01:29:42.294 --> 01:29:43.626
Good morning.

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:45.920
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?

01:29:46.006 --> 01:29:48.498
$850,000.

01:29:48.592 --> 01:29:51.005
Let's make it an even million.

01:30:12.032 --> 01:30:14.194
I forgot to give you a receipt.

01:30:54.658 --> 01:30:56.866
<i>- ¡Olé!</i>
- Hi, Jerry.

01:30:56.952 --> 01:31:00.070
- Everything under control?
- Have I got things to tell you.

01:31:01.373 --> 01:31:02.864
What happened?

01:31:02.958 --> 01:31:04.699
I'm engaged.

01:31:04.793 --> 01:31:06.785
Congratulations. Who's the lucky girl?

01:31:08.129 --> 01:31:09.415
I am.

01:31:14.302 --> 01:31:16.043
What?

01:31:16.137 --> 01:31:18.880
Osgood proposed to me.
We're planning a June wedding.

01:31:22.018 --> 01:31:25.102
What are you talking about?
You can't marry Osgood.

01:31:26.314 --> 01:31:27.930
You think he's too old for me?

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:30.562
- Jerry, you can't be serious.
- Why not?

01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:34.020
He keeps marrying girls all the time.

01:31:34.114 --> 01:31:36.197
But... But you're not a girl. You're a guy.

01:31:36.282 --> 01:31:38.490
And why would a guy want to marry a guy?

01:31:38.576 --> 01:31:41.193
Security.

01:31:41.871 --> 01:31:43.658
Jerry, you better lie down.
You're not well.

01:31:43.748 --> 01:31:45.956
Will you stop treating me like a child?
I'm not stupid.

01:31:46.042 --> 01:31:48.329
- I know there's a problem.
- I'll say there is.

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:50.332
His mother. We need her approval.

01:31:50.422 --> 01:31:52.914
But I'm not worried because I don't smoke.

01:31:56.261 --> 01:31:59.595
- Jerry, there's another problem.
- Like what?

01:31:59.681 --> 01:32:02.014
Like, what are you gonna do
on your honeymoon?

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:03.716
We've been discussing that.

01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:07.099
He wants to go to the Riviera,
but I kind of lean towards Niagara Falls.

01:32:11.776 --> 01:32:14.940
Jerry, you're out of your mind!
How are you gonna get away with this?

01:32:15.030 --> 01:32:17.272
I don't expect it to last, Joe.

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:19.635
- I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
- Like when?

01:32:19.659 --> 01:32:21.742
- Like, right after the ceremony.
- Oh.

01:32:21.828 --> 01:32:25.196
Then we get a quick annulment,
he makes a nice settlement on me,

01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:28.783
and I keep gettin'
those alimony checks every month.

01:32:31.588 --> 01:32:33.124
- Je... Jerry.
<i>- ¡Olé!</i>

01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:35.214
- Jerry. Jerry, listen to me. Listen to me.
- What?

01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:38.884
There are laws, conventions.
It's just not being done.

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:42.589
Shh! Joe, this may be my last chance
to marry a millionaire.

01:32:42.682 --> 01:32:43.682
- Jerry.
- Huh?

01:32:43.767 --> 01:32:46.760
Jerry, will you take my advice?
Forget about the whole thing, will you?

01:32:46.853 --> 01:32:49.095
Just keep telling yourself you're a boy.

01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:50.725
You're a boy.

01:32:50.815 --> 01:32:53.649
- I'm a boy.
- That's the boy.

01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:56.273
Oh, I'm a boy. I'm... I'm a boy.

01:32:56.362 --> 01:32:59.275
I'm... I wish I were dead. I'm a boy.

01:32:59.365 --> 01:33:01.448
I'm a boy. Oh, boy, am I a boy.

01:33:01.534 --> 01:33:03.821
Now, what am I gonna do
about my engagement present?

01:33:03.912 --> 01:33:06.620
- What engagement present?
- Osgood gave me a bracelet.

01:33:09.167 --> 01:33:11.705
- Hey, these are real diamonds.
- Of course they're real.

01:33:11.795 --> 01:33:15.835
What do you think, my fiancé is a bum?
Now I guess I'll have to give it back to him.

01:33:15.924 --> 01:33:17.335
- Wait a minute, Jerry.
- Huh?

01:33:17.425 --> 01:33:20.884
Let's not be hasty. After all, we don't
want to hurt Osgood's feelings, do we?

01:33:20.970 --> 01:33:23.257
Huh?

01:33:24.974 --> 01:33:27.842
- Just a minute.
- It's me, Sugar.

01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:36.145
Come in.

01:33:37.362 --> 01:33:38.898
I thought I heard voices.

01:33:38.988 --> 01:33:42.026
I had to talk to somebody.
I don't feel like going to sleep.

01:33:42.117 --> 01:33:43.824
I know what you need. A slug of bourbon.

01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:45.902
Oh, no. I'm off that stuff for good.

01:33:46.579 --> 01:33:49.071
- Did you have a nice time?
- Nice?

01:33:50.333 --> 01:33:53.326
It was suicidally beautiful.

01:33:53.419 --> 01:33:55.285
- Did he get fresh?
- Of course not.

01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:58.123
As a matter of fact,
it was just the other way around.

01:33:58.216 --> 01:34:00.754
- You see, he needs help.
- What for?

01:34:00.844 --> 01:34:03.678
Talk about elegant.
You should see the yacht.

01:34:03.763 --> 01:34:07.222
Candlelight, mint sauce, and cranberries.

01:34:07.308 --> 01:34:09.595
Gee, I wish I'd been there.

01:34:10.186 --> 01:34:12.803
I'm going to see him again tonight
and every night.

01:34:12.897 --> 01:34:16.015
I think he's going to propose to me,
soon as he gets up his nerve.

01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:17.475
That's some nerve.

01:34:17.569 --> 01:34:19.777
Daphne got a proposal tonight.

01:34:20.697 --> 01:34:22.984
- Really?
- From a rich millionaire.

01:34:23.074 --> 01:34:24.781
Oh, that's wonderful!

01:34:24.868 --> 01:34:27.076
- Poor Josephine.
- Me?

01:34:27.162 --> 01:34:29.279
Well, Daphne has a beau. I have a beau.

01:34:29.372 --> 01:34:31.864
If we could only find somebody for you.

01:34:34.460 --> 01:34:36.543
Here I am, doll.

01:34:59.027 --> 01:35:00.268
Hey!

01:35:02.530 --> 01:35:04.237
Friends of Italian opera.

01:35:04.324 --> 01:35:06.156
That's us.

01:35:06.242 --> 01:35:08.234
Register over there.

01:35:17.253 --> 01:35:20.746
Spats Colombo.
Delegate from Chicago, south side chapter.

01:35:21.841 --> 01:35:23.833
Thanks.

01:35:23.927 --> 01:35:25.338
Hiya, Spats.

01:35:25.428 --> 01:35:27.920
We was laying eight-to-one
you wouldn't show.

01:35:28.014 --> 01:35:29.095
Why wouldn't I?

01:35:29.182 --> 01:35:31.925
We thought you was all broken up
about Toothpick Charlie.

01:35:32.018 --> 01:35:34.226
- Well, we all gotta go sometime.
- Yeah.

01:35:34.312 --> 01:35:36.554
You never know who's gonna be next.

01:35:36.648 --> 01:35:39.015
Okay, Spats.
Uh, report to the sergeant-at-arms.

01:35:39.108 --> 01:35:40.394
What for?

01:35:40.485 --> 01:35:42.647
Orders from Little Bonaparte.

01:35:47.533 --> 01:35:50.367
- All right, Spats. Get your hands up.
- What's the idea?

01:35:50.453 --> 01:35:52.786
Little Bonaparte
don't want no hardware around.

01:35:53.665 --> 01:35:56.123
All right, you're clean.

01:35:56.209 --> 01:35:57.700
You're not.

01:36:08.221 --> 01:36:09.962
It ain't loaded.

01:36:18.648 --> 01:36:20.059
Next.

01:36:21.067 --> 01:36:22.729
- What's in here?
- My golf clubs.

01:36:22.819 --> 01:36:25.903
Putter, niblick, number three iron.

01:36:25.989 --> 01:36:28.481
- What's this?
- My mashie.

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:35.613
See you at the banquet, Spats.

01:36:37.083 --> 01:36:39.075
Where did you pick up that cheap trick?

01:36:40.295 --> 01:36:41.911
Come on, boys.

01:36:43.631 --> 01:36:46.044
Well, Spats Colombo if I ever saw one.

01:36:46.134 --> 01:36:48.171
Hello, copper.
What brings you down to Florida?

01:36:48.261 --> 01:36:50.461
Oh, I heard you opera lovers
were havin' a little rally,

01:36:50.513 --> 01:36:53.722
so I thought I'd better be around
in case anybody decided to sing.

01:36:53.808 --> 01:36:54.889
Big joke.

01:36:54.976 --> 01:36:57.621
Say, maestro, where were you
at three o'clock on Saint Valentine's Day?

01:36:57.645 --> 01:36:59.136
Me? I was at <i>Rigoletto.</i>

01:36:59.230 --> 01:37:01.959
- What's his first name? Where's he live?
- That's an opera, you ignoramus.

01:37:01.983 --> 01:37:04.350
Where did they play it,
in a garage on Clark Street?

01:37:04.444 --> 01:37:06.231
Clark Street? Never heard of it.

01:37:06.321 --> 01:37:09.314
Did you ever hear of the DeLuxe
French Cleaners on Wabash Avenue?

01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:10.407
Why?

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:12.678
Because the day after the shooting,
you sent in a pair of spats.

01:37:12.702 --> 01:37:15.160
- They had blood on 'em.
- I cut myself while shaving.

01:37:15.246 --> 01:37:17.659
- You shave with spats on?
- I sleep with my spats on.

01:37:17.749 --> 01:37:19.035
Why don't you stop kiddin'?

01:37:19.125 --> 01:37:21.725
You did that vulcanizing job
on Toothpick Charlie, and we know it.

01:37:21.753 --> 01:37:22.789
You and who else?

01:37:22.879 --> 01:37:26.919
Me and those two witnesses your lawyers
have been lookin' for all over Chicago.

01:37:27.008 --> 01:37:29.921
Boys, do you know anything
about any garage or any witnesses?

01:37:30.011 --> 01:37:32.719
Us? We was with you at Rigoletto's.

01:37:32.805 --> 01:37:34.637
Honest!

01:37:36.601 --> 01:37:38.217
Don't worry, Spats.

01:37:38.311 --> 01:37:40.803
One of these days
we're gonna dig up those two guys.

01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:43.731
That's what you'll have to do. Dig 'em up.

01:37:53.201 --> 01:37:54.988
I feel like such a tramp.

01:37:55.078 --> 01:37:57.616
Takin' jewelry from a man
under false pretenses.

01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:59.867
Get it while you're young.
You better fix your lips.

01:37:59.957 --> 01:38:01.677
You want to look nice for Osgood,
don't you?

01:38:01.751 --> 01:38:04.188
It is just gonna break his heart
when he finds out I can't marry him.

01:38:04.212 --> 01:38:06.982
So? It's gonna break Sugar's heart
when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.

01:38:07.006 --> 01:38:09.840
That's life. You can't make an omelet
without breakin' an egg.

01:38:09.926 --> 01:38:12.418
- What are you givin' me with the omelet?
- Nag, nag, nag.

01:38:12.512 --> 01:38:16.222
Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet.
You got Osgood, I've got Sugar.

01:38:16.307 --> 01:38:18.139
We're really cookin'.

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:23.303
- Joe.
- What?

01:38:25.149 --> 01:38:28.233
Something tells me
the omelet is about to hit the fan.

01:38:30.988 --> 01:38:32.820
- Come on, Daphne.
- Mm-hmm.

01:38:37.370 --> 01:38:39.202
- Going up!
- Hold it.

01:38:47.255 --> 01:38:49.212
Three, please.

01:39:00.226 --> 01:39:01.888
I don't mean to be forward,

01:39:01.978 --> 01:39:05.142
but ain't I had the pleasure
of meeting you two broads before?

01:39:05.231 --> 01:39:08.349
- Oh, no.
- You must be thinking of two other broads.

01:39:08.443 --> 01:39:10.560
You ever been in Chicago?

01:39:10.653 --> 01:39:13.942
Us? We wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago.

01:39:14.031 --> 01:39:15.311
Third floor.

01:39:15.366 --> 01:39:17.278
What floor are you on, sweetie?

01:39:17.368 --> 01:39:19.576
Never you mind.

01:39:19.662 --> 01:39:21.654
Room 413. We'll be in touch.

01:39:21.747 --> 01:39:24.160
Well, don't call us. We'll call you.

01:39:37.263 --> 01:39:38.879
I tell you, Joe, they're onto us.

01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:42.216
They're gonna line us up against the wall
and...

01:39:42.310 --> 01:39:44.267
And then the cops
are gonna find two dead dames,

01:39:44.353 --> 01:39:46.039
and they're gonna take us
to the ladies' morgue,

01:39:46.063 --> 01:39:48.542
and when they undress us, I tell you, Joe.
I'm gonna die of shame.

01:39:48.566 --> 01:39:51.400
- Shut up and keep packing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, Joe.

01:39:51.486 --> 01:39:53.603
- Not that, you idiot!
- Well, they're from Osgood.

01:39:53.696 --> 01:39:55.733
He wanted me to wear 'em tonight.

01:39:59.869 --> 01:40:02.907
I tell you, I will never find another man
who's so good to me.

01:40:02.997 --> 01:40:05.559
Joe, if we get out of this hotel alive,
you know what we're gonna do?

01:40:05.583 --> 01:40:07.686
We're gonna sell this bracelet,
and we're gonna take the money,

01:40:07.710 --> 01:40:09.480
and we're gonna grab a boat down
to South America,

01:40:09.504 --> 01:40:11.106
and hide out
in one of the banana republics.

01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:14.026
Because I figure that if we eat nothin'
but bananas, we could live there for 50 years.

01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:16.111
Maybe a hundred years.
If we get out of the hotel alive.

01:40:16.135 --> 01:40:17.797
Now, did we forget anything?

01:40:17.887 --> 01:40:19.687
- Yeah, there's the shaving stuff.
- Oh, yeah.

01:40:19.722 --> 01:40:22.135
- And there's also Sugar.
- Sugar?

01:40:22.225 --> 01:40:24.203
- Give me room 414.
- Now wait a minute. What are you doin'?

01:40:24.227 --> 01:40:25.787
- Makin' a telephone call.
- A telephone...

01:40:25.811 --> 01:40:27.177
Who has time for a telephone call?

01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:29.479
We can't just walk out on her
without saying good-bye.

01:40:29.565 --> 01:40:32.628
Since when? You usually walk out and
leave 'em with nothing but a kick in the teeth.

01:40:32.652 --> 01:40:35.645
That's when I was a saxophone player.
Now I'm a millionaire.

01:40:35.738 --> 01:40:39.197
Well, mail her a postcard.
Those gorillas may be up here any minute.

01:40:39.283 --> 01:40:42.367
Hello, Room 414?
This is the ship-to-shore operator.

01:40:42.453 --> 01:40:44.160
Ship-to-shore?

01:40:44.247 --> 01:40:46.660
Hey, Sugar, it's for you, from the yacht.

01:40:48.751 --> 01:40:49.751
Hello?

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:55.205
Hello, my dearest darling.
So good to hear your voice again.

01:40:55.299 --> 01:40:56.915
I may throw up!

01:40:59.554 --> 01:41:03.639
No, I didn't sleep too well, darling.
To tell the truth, I never closed an eye.

01:41:03.724 --> 01:41:07.513
I never slept better.
I had the most wonderful dream.

01:41:07.603 --> 01:41:10.141
I was still on the yacht,
and the anchor broke loose.

01:41:10.231 --> 01:41:12.769
We drifted for days and days.

01:41:12.858 --> 01:41:15.020
You were the captain, and I was the crew.

01:41:15.111 --> 01:41:17.023
I kept a lookout for icebergs.

01:41:17.113 --> 01:41:19.776
I sorted your shells
and mixed your cocktails.

01:41:19.865 --> 01:41:22.699
And I wiped the steam off your glasses.

01:41:22.785 --> 01:41:26.870
And when I woke up,
I wanted to swim right back to you.

01:41:27.582 --> 01:41:29.699
Yes.

01:41:29.792 --> 01:41:32.000
Now, about our date for tonight. Uh...

01:41:32.086 --> 01:41:34.954
I'll meet you on the pier again
right after the show.

01:41:35.923 --> 01:41:38.381
I'm afraid not. I can't make it tonight.

01:41:40.761 --> 01:41:43.253
Not tomorrow either.
You see, I have to leave.

01:41:43.347 --> 01:41:46.306
Something unexpected came up.
Uh, I'm sailing right away.

01:41:47.310 --> 01:41:49.597
Where to?

01:41:49.687 --> 01:41:51.679
South America?

01:41:51.772 --> 01:41:55.265
Oh. That is unexpected.

01:41:56.360 --> 01:41:58.773
You see, we have
these oil interests in Venezuela.

01:41:58.863 --> 01:42:00.820
I just got a cable from Dad.

01:42:00.906 --> 01:42:03.193
The board of directors
have decided on a merger.

01:42:03.284 --> 01:42:06.243
A merger? How long will you be gone?

01:42:08.331 --> 01:42:10.163
Quite a while.

01:42:10.249 --> 01:42:12.491
As a matter of fact,
I'm not coming back at all.

01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:14.205
You're not?

01:42:15.963 --> 01:42:19.377
Well, it's all rather complicated.
What we call high finance.

01:42:19.467 --> 01:42:22.631
It just so happens, the president
of the Venezuelan oil syndicate

01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:24.302
has a daughter, and, uh...

01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:27.096
Oh. That kind of merger.

01:42:27.767 --> 01:42:29.599
What is she like?

01:42:29.685 --> 01:42:32.393
According to our tax adviser,
she's only so-so.

01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:34.597
But that's the way the oil gushes.

01:42:34.690 --> 01:42:38.183
You know, a man in my position has
a certain responsibility to the stockholders.

01:42:38.277 --> 01:42:41.236
You know, all those little people
who have invested their life savings.

01:42:41.989 --> 01:42:44.481
Oh, of course. I understand.

01:42:44.575 --> 01:42:46.066
At least I think I do.

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:47.571
I knew you would.

01:42:47.662 --> 01:42:52.123
I only wish there was something
I could... I could do for you.

01:42:52.208 --> 01:42:53.699
But you have.

01:42:53.793 --> 01:42:55.830
You've given me all that inside information.

01:42:55.920 --> 01:42:57.720
First thing tomorrow,
I'm gonna call my broker

01:42:57.755 --> 01:43:01.248
and have him buy me
50,000 shares of Venezuelan oil.

01:43:01.342 --> 01:43:03.584
Smart move.

01:43:03.678 --> 01:43:06.466
By the way, did you get my flowers?

01:43:06.555 --> 01:43:08.922
You know,
those orchids from my greenhouse?

01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:13.181
The fog finally lifted over Long Island,
and they flew them down this morning.

01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:15.227
That's strange.

01:43:15.314 --> 01:43:17.306
I sent them to your room.

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:21.192
They should have been delivered by now.

01:43:25.074 --> 01:43:28.363
Hey, Dolores?
Will you see if there's any flowers outside?

01:43:34.542 --> 01:43:37.626
Yes, they're here. White orchids.

01:43:37.712 --> 01:43:40.705
I haven't had white orchids
since I was a debutante.

01:43:42.591 --> 01:43:44.082
What's this?

01:43:45.594 --> 01:43:47.085
What's what?

01:43:47.179 --> 01:43:49.887
Oh, that. Just a little going-away present.

01:43:50.808 --> 01:43:53.391
Real diamonds.

01:43:53.477 --> 01:43:55.844
They must be worth their weight in gold.

01:43:55.938 --> 01:43:58.271
Are you always this generous?

01:43:59.608 --> 01:44:01.144
Not always.

01:44:01.235 --> 01:44:04.399
But I wanted you to know how very grateful
I am for what you did for me.

01:44:04.488 --> 01:44:07.822
I didn't do anything. It just happened.

01:44:09.452 --> 01:44:13.412
Oh, the navigator just came in.
We're ready to cast off.

01:44:13.998 --> 01:44:17.116
Well, anchors aweigh
and have a bon voyage.

01:44:17.209 --> 01:44:19.201
If you need an orchestra
to play at your wedding,

01:44:19.295 --> 01:44:21.582
we'll be through here
in a couple of weeks.

01:44:21.672 --> 01:44:24.164
- Good-bye, my darling.
- Phew.

01:44:24.258 --> 01:44:27.547
I don't know about the captain,
but the navigator's gettin' his tail out of here.

01:44:27.636 --> 01:44:30.003
- Yeah. Let's shove off.
- Wait a minute. My bracelet.

01:44:33.434 --> 01:44:35.266
What happened to my bracelet?

01:44:35.352 --> 01:44:37.389
What do you mean, <i>your</i> bracelet?
It's our bracelet.

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:39.346
All right. What happened to our bracelet?

01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:42.127
- Don't worry. We did the right thing with it.
- Well, what did we do?

01:44:42.151 --> 01:44:44.143
Joe, you're not pulling
one of your old tricks!

01:44:44.236 --> 01:44:46.319
No tricks, no mirrors.
Nothing up my sleeve.

01:44:46.405 --> 01:44:48.067
- It's on the level this time.
- You...

01:44:55.206 --> 01:44:57.323
Where's that bourbon?

01:45:03.255 --> 01:45:05.668
- What's the matter, Sugar?
- I don't know.

01:45:05.758 --> 01:45:08.045
All of a sudden, I'm thirsty.

01:45:09.303 --> 01:45:11.044
How did you get that bracelet?

01:45:11.138 --> 01:45:12.970
- You like it?
- I always did.

01:45:13.057 --> 01:45:14.844
Junior gave it to me.

01:45:14.934 --> 01:45:17.893
He's going to South America
to marry another girl.

01:45:17.978 --> 01:45:21.062
- That's what you call high finance.
- That's what I call a louse.

01:45:21.148 --> 01:45:24.732
Sugar, if I were you, I would take that bracelet
and throw it right back in his face.

01:45:24.819 --> 01:45:25.855
Daphne.

01:45:25.945 --> 01:45:28.107
He's the first nice guy
I ever met in my life.

01:45:28.197 --> 01:45:31.531
- The only one that ever gave me anything.
- You'll forget him, Sugar.

01:45:33.202 --> 01:45:34.693
How can I?

01:45:34.787 --> 01:45:38.497
No matter where I go, there'll always be
a Shell station on every corner.

01:45:38.582 --> 01:45:40.949
I'll bring this back when it's empty.

01:45:43.921 --> 01:45:45.412
Are you crazy or somethin'?

01:45:45.506 --> 01:45:48.374
The place is crawlin' with mobsters.
Gangrene is settin' in.

01:45:48.467 --> 01:45:50.424
And you,
you're makin' like Diamond Jim Brady.

01:45:50.511 --> 01:45:52.719
How are we gonna get out of here?
How are we gonna eat?

01:45:52.805 --> 01:45:54.546
We'll walk.
And if we have to, we'll starve.

01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:56.802
Yeah. There you go with that "we" again.

01:45:56.892 --> 01:45:59.976
Not that way. We don't want
to run into Spats and his chums.

01:46:00.062 --> 01:46:01.553
Where... Oh.

01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:11.396
Your hands clean?

01:46:11.490 --> 01:46:14.107
Over. Okay. Button my spats.

01:46:18.247 --> 01:46:20.113
You sure dress nice, boss.

01:46:20.207 --> 01:46:23.496
Say, boss, I been talking
with some of the other delegates.

01:46:23.586 --> 01:46:25.546
And the word is
that Little Bonaparte is real sore

01:46:25.629 --> 01:46:27.871
about what happened to Toothpick Charlie.

01:46:27.965 --> 01:46:30.207
Him and Charlie,
they used to be choirboys together.

01:46:30.301 --> 01:46:31.883
Stop, or I'll bust out cryin'.

01:46:31.969 --> 01:46:34.364
He even got Charlie's last toothpick,
the one from the garage.

01:46:34.388 --> 01:46:35.629
He had it gold-plated.

01:46:35.723 --> 01:46:39.558
Like I was tellin' you, fellas,
Little Bonaparte's gettin' soft.

01:46:39.643 --> 01:46:43.387
Hasn't got it here anymore.
Used to be like a rock.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.563
Oh, it's too bad.

01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:47.641
I think it's about time he should retire.

01:46:47.735 --> 01:46:50.603
- Second the motion.
- How are we gonna retire him?

01:46:50.696 --> 01:46:52.562
Oh, we'll think of somethin' cute.

01:46:52.656 --> 01:46:54.898
One of these days,
Little Bonaparte and Toothpick Charlie

01:46:54.992 --> 01:46:57.075
will be singin' in the same choir again.

01:47:00.289 --> 01:47:03.123
But this time,
we'll make sure there are no witnesses.

01:47:06.295 --> 01:47:07.786
Look!

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:10.167
The two broads from the elevator.

01:47:12.676 --> 01:47:14.463
Hey! Join us.

01:47:16.138 --> 01:47:18.721
What's the matter with those dames?

01:47:18.807 --> 01:47:20.799
Maybe those dames ain't dames.

01:47:23.771 --> 01:47:26.354
Same faces. Same instruments.

01:47:30.319 --> 01:47:33.528
- And here's your Valentine's card.
- The two musicians from the garage.

01:47:33.614 --> 01:47:37.574
They wouldn't be caught dead in Chicago,
so we'll finish the job here.

01:47:37.660 --> 01:47:39.151
Come on.

01:47:57.513 --> 01:47:59.129
All right. So what do we do now?

01:47:59.223 --> 01:48:01.761
First thing we gotta do
is get out of these clothes.

01:48:10.693 --> 01:48:12.104
Yoo-hoo.

01:49:35.027 --> 01:49:36.027
Huh?

01:49:40.866 --> 01:49:41.947
What happened?

01:49:42.034 --> 01:49:45.573
Me and Tiny, we had 'em cornered,
but we lost 'em in the shuffle.

01:49:45.662 --> 01:49:48.996
- Where were you guys?
- We was with you at Rigoletto's.

01:49:49.083 --> 01:49:51.450
- Why, you stupid idiot.
- That's all right, boss.

01:49:51.543 --> 01:49:54.536
We'll get 'em after the banquet.
They can't be too far away.

01:50:14.566 --> 01:50:16.683
Thank you.

01:50:16.777 --> 01:50:18.769
Thank you, fellow opera lovers.

01:50:20.155 --> 01:50:24.149
It's been ten years since I elected myself
president of this organization.

01:50:24.243 --> 01:50:27.486
And if I say so myself,
you made the right choice.

01:50:30.082 --> 01:50:31.869
Let's look at the record.

01:50:31.959 --> 01:50:37.205
In the last fiscal year,
we made $112 million before taxes.

01:50:38.340 --> 01:50:39.831
Only we ain't pay no taxes.

01:50:42.553 --> 01:50:46.888
Of course, like in every business,
we had our little misunderstandings.

01:50:46.974 --> 01:50:50.809
Uh, let us now rise and observe
one minute of silence

01:50:50.894 --> 01:50:55.685
in memory of seven of our members
from Chicago, north side chapter,

01:50:55.774 --> 01:50:59.142
who are unable to be here with us tonight
on account of bein' rubbed out.

01:51:05.075 --> 01:51:07.863
You too, Spats. Up!

01:51:18.547 --> 01:51:20.459
Easy, now.

01:51:20.549 --> 01:51:22.165
- You know when you come out?
- Yeah.

01:51:22.259 --> 01:51:23.875
Second time they sing...

01:51:23.969 --> 01:51:28.088
<i>♪ For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny ♪</i>

01:51:28.182 --> 01:51:29.673
Okay.

01:51:34.146 --> 01:51:36.058
And don't mess up the cake.

01:51:36.148 --> 01:51:39.391
I promised
to bring back a piece to my kids.

01:51:46.658 --> 01:51:52.620
Now, fellow delegates, there comes a time
in the life of every business executive

01:51:52.706 --> 01:51:55.665
when he starts thinking about retirement.

01:51:55.751 --> 01:51:59.836
No! No!

01:51:59.922 --> 01:52:03.632
In lookin' around
for somebody to fill my shoes,

01:52:03.717 --> 01:52:06.585
I've been considerin' several candidates.

01:52:06.678 --> 01:52:10.467
For instance,
there's a certain party from Chicago,

01:52:10.557 --> 01:52:12.298
south side chapter.

01:52:14.561 --> 01:52:19.431
Now, some people say
he's gotten a little too big for his spats!

01:52:20.150 --> 01:52:23.894
But I say, he's a man who'll go far.

01:52:23.987 --> 01:52:28.027
Some people say he's gone too far!

01:52:28.116 --> 01:52:31.951
But I say, you can't keep a good man down.

01:52:33.038 --> 01:52:35.121
Of course, he's still got a lot to learn.

01:52:35.207 --> 01:52:37.950
That big noise he made
on Saint Valentine's Day,

01:52:38.043 --> 01:52:41.457
that wasn't very good for public relations.

01:52:41.546 --> 01:52:46.132
And lettin' them two witnesses get away,
that sure was careless.

01:52:47.552 --> 01:52:50.590
Don't worry about those two guys.
They're as good as dead.

01:52:50.681 --> 01:52:52.764
I almost caught up with them today.

01:52:52.849 --> 01:52:57.093
You mean, you let 'em get away twice?

01:52:57.187 --> 01:53:00.271
Some people would say that's real sloppy.

01:53:00.357 --> 01:53:04.647
But I say, to err is human,
to forgive divine.

01:53:04.736 --> 01:53:07.103
And just to show you
what I think of you, Spats,

01:53:07.197 --> 01:53:09.735
the boys told me
you was gonna have a birthday,

01:53:09.825 --> 01:53:11.908
so we baked you a little cake.

01:53:12.869 --> 01:53:14.610
My birthday?

01:53:14.705 --> 01:53:16.571
Why, it ain't for another four months.

01:53:16.665 --> 01:53:21.410
So we're a little early.
So what's a few months between friends?

01:53:21.503 --> 01:53:23.711
All right, boys. Now, all together.

01:53:23.797 --> 01:53:26.380
<i>♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪</i>

01:53:26.466 --> 01:53:28.924
<i>♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪</i>

01:53:29.011 --> 01:53:32.925
<i>♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪</i>

01:53:33.015 --> 01:53:35.473

01:53:37.936 --> 01:53:40.303
<i>♪ Which nobody can deny ♪</i>

01:53:40.397 --> 01:53:42.764

01:53:42.858 --> 01:53:45.100

01:53:45.193 --> 01:53:48.436

01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:51.398
<i>♪ Which nobody can deny ♪</i>

01:54:07.466 --> 01:54:08.957
Big joke.

01:54:15.724 --> 01:54:18.592
Let's get out of here.

01:54:21.563 --> 01:54:23.600
Get those two guys!

01:54:26.568 --> 01:54:28.560
Get the light, will you?

01:54:30.739 --> 01:54:32.856
What happened here?

01:54:32.949 --> 01:54:36.033
There was somethin' in that cake
that didn't agree with 'em.

01:54:37.954 --> 01:54:40.241
My compliments to the chef.

01:54:40.332 --> 01:54:42.665
Nobody leaves this room
till I get the recipe.

01:54:42.751 --> 01:54:45.038
You want to make a federal case of it?

01:54:49.716 --> 01:54:51.423
Yeah.

01:55:19.079 --> 01:55:20.848
- They slipped through our hands.
- Don't worry.

01:55:20.872 --> 01:55:24.081
We got our guys watchin' the railroad station,
the roads, and the airport.

01:55:24.167 --> 01:55:26.079
- They can't get away.
- Did you hear that?

01:55:26.169 --> 01:55:29.458
Yeah, but they're not watching yachts.
Come on. You're gonna call Osgood.

01:55:29.548 --> 01:55:31.505
I'm gonna call...
What am I gonna tell him?

01:55:31.591 --> 01:55:34.129
- Tell him you're gonna elope with him.
- Elope?

01:55:34.219 --> 01:55:36.836
Elope? But there are laws, conventions.

01:55:36.930 --> 01:55:40.924
There's a convention, all right.
There's also the ladies' morgue.

01:55:46.440 --> 01:55:48.932

01:55:49.025 --> 01:55:51.608

Josephine!

01:57:46.101 --> 01:57:49.139
Bienstock!

01:57:49.729 --> 01:57:51.641
Hey, that's no dame.

01:57:51.731 --> 01:57:54.223
None of that, Sugar.

01:57:54.317 --> 01:57:56.434
No guy is worth it.

01:57:58.488 --> 01:58:00.174
What's goin' on?

01:58:00.198 --> 01:58:03.157
- Grab her.
- Hey, hey, wait a minute.

01:58:03.243 --> 01:58:05.656
What are you trying to do here?
What's going on?

01:58:05.745 --> 01:58:07.236
Josephine?

01:58:12.877 --> 01:58:14.709
It's all set.
Osgood's meeting us at the pier.

01:58:14.796 --> 01:58:16.753
We're not on the pier yet.

01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:08.472
Hi.

01:59:08.558 --> 01:59:10.595
My friend Josephine.
Gonna be a bridesmaid.

01:59:10.685 --> 01:59:13.393
- Well, pleased to meet you.
- Come on!

01:59:13.480 --> 01:59:15.312
She's so eager.

01:59:29.287 --> 01:59:31.700
Wait! Wait for Sugar!

01:59:36.711 --> 01:59:38.998
- Another bridesmaid?
- Flower girl!

01:59:39.089 --> 01:59:42.503
- Sugar, what do you think you're doing?
- I told you, I'm not very bright.

01:59:42.592 --> 01:59:44.083
Let's go!

01:59:47.806 --> 01:59:50.799
You don't want me, Sugar.
I'm a liar and a phony.

01:59:50.892 --> 01:59:52.178
A saxophone player.

01:59:52.268 --> 01:59:54.476
One of those no-goodniks
you keep running away from.

01:59:54.562 --> 01:59:56.053
I know. Every time.

01:59:56.147 --> 01:59:59.436
Sugar, do yourself a favor.
Go back to where the millionaires are.

01:59:59.526 --> 02:00:01.062
The sweet end of the lollipop,

02:00:01.152 --> 02:00:04.987
not the coleslaw in the face, the old socks,
and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste.

02:00:05.073 --> 02:00:07.907
That's right. Pour it on.
Talk me out of it.

02:00:13.123 --> 02:00:15.706
I called Mama. She was so happy she cried.

02:00:15.792 --> 02:00:18.330
She wants you to have her wedding gown.
It's white lace.

02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:21.208
Osgood, I can't get married
in your mother's dress.

02:00:22.590 --> 02:00:26.459
She and I, we are not built the same way.

02:00:26.553 --> 02:00:28.761
- We can have it altered.
- Oh, no, you don't.

02:00:30.598 --> 02:00:33.887
Osgood, I'm gonna level with you.
We can't get married at all.

02:00:33.977 --> 02:00:35.468
Why not?

02:00:35.562 --> 02:00:38.896
Well, in the first place,
I'm not a natural blonde.

02:00:38.982 --> 02:00:41.440
Doesn't matter.

02:00:41.526 --> 02:00:43.813
I smoke. I smoke all the time.

02:00:43.903 --> 02:00:45.394
I don't care.

02:00:45.488 --> 02:00:46.979
I have a terrible past.

02:00:47.073 --> 02:00:49.907
For three years now,
I've been living with a saxophone player.

02:00:49.993 --> 02:00:51.484
I forgive you.

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:55.788
I can never have children.

02:00:56.416 --> 02:00:58.123
We can adopt some.

02:00:58.209 --> 02:01:00.542
Well, you don't understand, Osgood.

02:01:00.628 --> 02:01:03.496
Ah! I'm a man.

02:01:03.590 --> 02:01:05.673
Well, nobody's perfect.
