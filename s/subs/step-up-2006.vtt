00:33.960 --> 00:35.587
Fight!

00:42.177 --> 00:45.805
This is definitely the wickedest thing
I ever hear in my life!

00:54.356 --> 00:56.441
# Can't nobody do it like I do it

00:56.483 --> 00:58.610
# When I do it, dawg, I do it

00:58.652 --> 01:02.739
# Break it down, put your back into it
Y'all ain't ready for the shit I'm doin'

01:02.822 --> 01:05.158
- # Get up, get up
- # How'd you change the sound?

01:05.241 --> 01:07.285
# Took the other one I had,
swapped it out

01:07.327 --> 01:09.329
# Kept somethin' in the background

01:09.371 --> 01:11.790
# You know the song
Do it with the background

01:11.831 --> 01:14.125
# Show off that body you got

01:14.167 --> 01:16.211
# You got the dance flo' so hot

01:16.294 --> 01:18.296
# You workin' that, you trickin' that

01:18.338 --> 01:20.590
# You trickin' that shit like a plot

01:20.674 --> 01:22.801
# Show off that body you got

01:22.842 --> 01:24.928
# You got the dance flo' so hot

01:25.011 --> 01:27.138
# You workin' that, you trickin' that

01:27.222 --> 01:29.307
# You trickin' that shit like a plot

01:29.349 --> 01:32.978
This is definitely the wickedest thing
I ever hear in my life!

01:35.105 --> 01:36.314
# Get up, get up, get up

01:39.234 --> 01:42.445
# OK, get up, get up

01:44.531 --> 01:46.366
# You can do what you do
and do it well

01:46.449 --> 01:49.369
# Can't nobody do it like I do it

01:49.452 --> 01:51.788
# Do it, break it down

01:54.958 --> 01:56.459
# Get up

01:59.254 --> 02:03.008
# I'm goin' five on the Richter scale
The highest number you can roll is 12

02:03.049 --> 02:06.177
- # Shorty, shake it like a...
- # Show off that body you got

02:06.261 --> 02:08.346
# You got the dance flo' so hot

02:08.430 --> 02:10.514
# You workin' that, you trickin' that

02:10.556 --> 02:12.684
# You trickin' that shit like a plot

02:12.726 --> 02:14.894
# Show off that body you got

02:14.978 --> 02:17.063
# You got the dance flo' so hot

02:17.147 --> 02:19.149
# You workin' that, you trickin' that

02:19.232 --> 02:21.735
# You trickin' that shit like a plot

02:45.133 --> 02:47.218
Whoo-ee!

02:50.138 --> 02:53.391
Yo, Mac. Mac. Mac.

02:53.433 --> 02:55.810
- What?
- Hey, man, you wanna do a lap?

02:55.894 --> 02:58.313
Does it look like I need to do a lap?

02:58.396 --> 03:01.066
- Just go.
- Man, this party's wack.

03:01.983 --> 03:06.279
- Who is this guy?
- This is my little brother Skinny.

03:06.363 --> 03:08.782
None other than.

03:08.823 --> 03:11.993
- So, uh, how you doin'?
- Hey, man, what you doin'?

03:12.077 --> 03:15.664
- Why don't I come back a little later?
- What? No, no...

03:15.747 --> 03:18.375
You must have
the recessive genes in the family.

03:18.458 --> 03:21.753
Recessive what?
Girls here is just stuck up, that's all.

03:21.836 --> 03:25.215
- Is that what it is, Skinny?
- Let's bounce. Where's Tyler?

03:25.298 --> 03:26.591
Where you think he at?

03:45.402 --> 03:47.862
Yeah! Whoo!

04:08.008 --> 04:10.510
- What you doin' with my girl?
- PJ, we're dancin'.

04:10.593 --> 04:14.472
- Shut up, you bitch.
- I didn't see your name on her, man.

04:15.473 --> 04:17.976
Hey, come on, PJ!

04:18.017 --> 04:22.981
- Yeah, check him out!
- White boy's whoopin' on PJ!

04:23.565 --> 04:24.941
Get off him!

04:27.527 --> 04:30.530
- Better rethink your strategy.
- A'ight, man, you got it.

04:30.613 --> 04:33.199
Come on, Tyler, let's go.
Skinny, let's go.

04:33.283 --> 04:36.578
Tyler, let's go, man.
Skinny, come on, man.

04:39.831 --> 04:42.625
- Get off me!
- Go, man.

04:42.709 --> 04:44.627
Why you pushin' me so much?

04:44.711 --> 04:47.297
- Tyler, move!
- Stop pushin'.

04:48.214 --> 04:50.008
You just wanna be Rocky.

04:50.091 --> 04:52.510
- I started nothin'.
- You always finishin' it.

04:52.552 --> 04:55.347
- Wanna pull guns? I'll show you mine.
- Shut up, man.

04:55.430 --> 05:00.393
Do you feel like because you a white boy,
you got to overcompensate sometimes?

05:00.477 --> 05:02.395
Wow! Wow!

05:02.437 --> 05:07.984
- You got me all figured out, Montel.
- I may be Montel, but you Jerry Springer.

05:08.068 --> 05:09.402
Yo, yo, check this out.

05:09.444 --> 05:12.781
- You Montel, you Jerry Springer and I'm...
- Jenny Jones.

05:12.864 --> 05:14.240
Nah. Nah, nah. Nah, man.

05:14.324 --> 05:17.035
- He's like Ellen.
- Except Ellen get more chicks.

05:17.077 --> 05:18.203
Aah-ha-ha!

05:18.244 --> 05:20.080
Hey, shut up.

05:22.874 --> 05:27.212
I can't believe you fought PJ, man.
Hold up. That's PJ.

05:27.253 --> 05:29.422
Man...

05:29.506 --> 05:31.883
- What is he doin'?
- Skinny, what are you...

05:33.009 --> 05:36.846
What the hell you think you doin'? Am I
the only one not tryin' to get us killed?

05:36.930 --> 05:38.056
I ain't afraid of him.

05:38.139 --> 05:41.977
You waited till the car got around
the corner before you threw something.

05:42.060 --> 05:45.105
- That's real brave.
- I ain't afraid of nobody.

05:45.188 --> 05:49.234
I ain't afraid of you
and I'm definitely not afraid of you.

05:50.610 --> 05:53.571
- I'll throw something at you.
- That's how you miss.

05:54.114 --> 05:57.367
Stand still, then.

05:57.867 --> 05:59.744
- Where was it?
- There.

06:01.287 --> 06:02.330
Oh...

06:02.956 --> 06:05.667
Hey, yo, come on, man!
I know this place.

06:05.750 --> 06:07.711
It's that school.

06:07.794 --> 06:11.464
- This don't look like no school.
- It is a school. I'll show you.

06:11.548 --> 06:14.050
Skinny!

06:16.678 --> 06:19.180
- He's your brother. You go get him.
- Come on.

06:19.264 --> 06:20.974
- I ain't goin' in there.
- Come on.

06:21.057 --> 06:22.058
Damn!

06:28.648 --> 06:30.900
Watch yourself.
Come on, man.

06:30.984 --> 06:32.110
Shh, shh, shh.

06:32.152 --> 06:36.406
- This looks like a museum.
- It's not a museum.

06:37.532 --> 06:39.826
Ty, man, quit playin', man.

06:41.161 --> 06:43.705
Look. Skinny's right.
This is a school.

06:43.788 --> 06:45.540
- Arts school.
- I told you.

06:45.623 --> 06:48.877
- Who goes here, then?
- Look like some stuck-up rich folks.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.712
Look at these dudes.

06:50.795 --> 06:54.424
All sweet with the shirts all tight
like they spray-painted 'em on.

06:54.507 --> 06:55.467
Yeah.

06:55.550 --> 06:58.303
It do show off their muscles
pretty nice, though.

06:59.846 --> 07:02.349
- No, I'm just...
- No, no. Don't touch me.

07:02.432 --> 07:04.559
- Mac. I'm just...
- Don't touch me.

07:04.643 --> 07:07.354
I'm just sayin'
they in good shape is all.

07:07.437 --> 07:11.483
- We need to get you a girl fast.
- I got girls. I just don't show 'em to ya.

07:11.566 --> 07:13.693
- Why?
- Y'all are gonna try and take 'em.

07:13.777 --> 07:16.696
- What you talkin' about?
- Check this out!

07:19.532 --> 07:23.036
- Look at this place.
- We got nothin' like this in our school.

07:23.119 --> 07:27.165
That's 'cause our school's broke.
Hey, yo, wait up.

07:27.248 --> 07:28.958
These rich kids get everything.

07:29.042 --> 07:31.795
What is this, man?
Seems like a playground to me.

07:33.004 --> 07:36.758
# Figaro, Figaro,
Figaro, Figaro, Figaro

07:37.342 --> 07:39.386
Look at this stuff.

07:39.469 --> 07:42.013
Let's bounce, man.

07:43.306 --> 07:46.643
- Skinny, what are you...?
- It was a accident.

07:46.726 --> 07:51.690
Skinny, don't worry.
These rich kids can afford this. Look. Ha!

07:57.737 --> 07:59.030
Look, look.

07:59.614 --> 08:00.615
# Oh-wah...

08:00.699 --> 08:03.159
- Hey, heads up!
- Whoa!

08:03.994 --> 08:06.204
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

08:07.038 --> 08:09.040
# La la la-la

08:11.918 --> 08:13.628
I challenge you.

08:14.212 --> 08:16.006
I win!

08:16.089 --> 08:18.425
- It's a rumble.
- Aah!

08:18.508 --> 08:20.844
Oof!

08:20.927 --> 08:22.929
That ain't funny, man.

08:23.013 --> 08:24.556
Look out! Whoa!

08:29.728 --> 08:31.688
Hey, yo, yo, watch out!

08:31.771 --> 08:34.399
Ha-ha!

08:34.441 --> 08:37.861
- Having fun?
- Get off me!

08:37.943 --> 08:40.572
Party's over.
You're comin' with me.

08:41.614 --> 08:45.910
- I didn't do nothin', man. Get off...
- Go, go, go, man.

08:48.538 --> 08:50.165
Yo, Ty!

08:50.248 --> 08:52.250
Man, just go. Go!

08:53.960 --> 08:57.172
- Very noble.
- Shut up, rent-a-cop!

09:00.717 --> 09:05.764
Breaking and entering, vandalism
of the Maryland School of the Arts.

09:05.805 --> 09:09.559
- You a student there?
- No.

09:09.643 --> 09:14.773
You've been in this courtroom several
times. Where are your foster parents?

09:14.814 --> 09:18.777
- Can you answer me with a sentence?
- My foster mom's trying to get off work.

09:18.818 --> 09:20.153
OK, Mr. Gage, look.

09:20.236 --> 09:24.115
This is the way we play the game here.
You break it, you buy it.

09:24.157 --> 09:28.078
200 hours of community service to be
performed at the scene of the offense -

09:28.161 --> 09:30.080
the Maryland School of the Arts.

09:32.999 --> 09:34.209
Whatever.

09:41.841 --> 09:44.636
I got here as fast as I could.

09:59.150 --> 10:00.527
We're back.

10:00.610 --> 10:03.613
- What'd he get?
- 200 hours community service.

10:03.697 --> 10:06.032
Won't make it.
He's never stayed with anything.

10:06.116 --> 10:09.327
Why do you care?
You get your check every month.

10:09.369 --> 10:11.246
- Kids, wash up.
- What did you say?

10:13.164 --> 10:17.460
Wait, slow down. You're makin' Bill dizzy
and he's not even drunk yet.

10:17.544 --> 10:21.840
Guys, come on. Let's just have a nice
dinner before I have to go back to work.

10:21.881 --> 10:24.217
I'm not hungry.

10:24.301 --> 10:26.720
Hey, shut up!
I'm trying to watch this!

10:34.561 --> 10:36.855
# Dress the hater,
no mask, only cape

10:36.938 --> 10:39.607
# I ain't pressed for paper,
thug investigators

10:39.691 --> 10:42.527
# I'm cooler than a 'frigerator,
sweeter than...

10:43.903 --> 10:45.905
Are you going to prison?

10:45.947 --> 10:48.158
How many times
do I have to tell you to knock?

10:48.241 --> 10:51.578
That's where my dad is, at the supermax.
He liked it better at Jessup.

10:51.661 --> 10:54.622
No, Camille,
I'm not goin' to prison.

10:54.706 --> 10:59.002
But they are gonna have to take me
to prison if you don't start knocking.

10:59.085 --> 11:01.046
Get outta here.

12:34.848 --> 12:36.850
Excuse me.

12:44.316 --> 12:46.276
I need that new arrangement.

12:50.322 --> 12:56.328
I see. We were hoping to link the
fund-raiser to the fall showcase. Mm-hm.

12:56.411 --> 13:00.165
So we absolutely
can't do it on a Friday?

13:00.206 --> 13:01.916
I'm Tyler Gage.
I'm here to...

13:02.000 --> 13:03.835
Come in, Mr. Gage.
Take a seat.

13:03.877 --> 13:08.298
We'll just have to move the event till March
and hope the Pratts come through.

13:08.381 --> 13:10.091
Thanks, Denise.

13:18.099 --> 13:22.979
Well, I see that you're
overwhelmed with remorse.

13:23.063 --> 13:27.484
You have no idea of the consequences
of your actions, do you?

13:27.567 --> 13:29.944
Yeah. 200 hours.

13:30.403 --> 13:32.947
Actually, there's a little more to it.

13:33.031 --> 13:36.159
Most of our students
are here on scholarship.

13:36.242 --> 13:39.037
The cost of repairing
the damage that you did

13:39.120 --> 13:41.915
is roughly the equivalent
of one student's tuition.

13:41.998 --> 13:45.543
Do you understand
what that means?

13:46.419 --> 13:49.214
You just cost someone their future.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.759
Sorry.

13:53.593 --> 13:56.680
Look, I'm just here to do my hours.

14:01.267 --> 14:04.396
It says here that your school day
finishes at two.

14:04.437 --> 14:09.442
Per the court's order, you're to report here
and stay until 5:30.

14:09.526 --> 14:12.570
Now, if you'll follow me, Mr. Gage,

14:12.654 --> 14:16.616
I have someone who is
very eager to meet you.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.377
- Mr. McCaffrey.
- Director Gordon.

14:27.460 --> 14:31.881
This is Tyler Gage,
your new intern.

14:31.965 --> 14:34.509
I'd like a daily report
on his activities.

14:34.592 --> 14:37.262
Great. Here you go.

14:43.601 --> 14:46.021
And stop
and bring it around front

14:46.104 --> 14:50.525
and one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

14:50.608 --> 14:55.238
And a-one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, go!

14:55.322 --> 15:00.160
One, two, three, four
and five, six, seven. And up!

15:01.077 --> 15:03.246
And now up!

15:08.543 --> 15:11.796
Um, hello.
Who is that?

15:14.007 --> 15:15.967
Come on, he is fine.

15:16.051 --> 15:17.636
Don't you have a boyfriend?

15:17.719 --> 15:22.307
Yes, and my boyfriend would
appreciate my good taste. Thank you.

15:23.850 --> 15:27.187
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

15:27.270 --> 15:29.481
And a-one, two and three and four.

15:29.564 --> 15:31.358
Good, Nora. Six, seven.

15:31.441 --> 15:35.987
And a-one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

15:36.029 --> 15:40.617
And a-one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.577
And one, two, three, four...

15:42.661 --> 15:44.829
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:44.913 --> 15:48.708
And a-one, two, three,
four and five, six, seven.

15:48.792 --> 15:54.005
And a-one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

15:54.047 --> 15:57.050
Good class, you guys.
Good job.

15:59.844 --> 16:02.931
- So I'll see you at rehearsal, OK, Andrew?
- You got it.

16:08.395 --> 16:10.689
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

16:11.398 --> 16:14.609
- Walk you to your next class?
- I just gotta stop by my locker.

16:14.693 --> 16:16.361
- All right.
- How are you?

16:16.444 --> 16:19.906
- Good. How was class?
- It was good.

16:19.990 --> 16:22.993
Guys, is that our new janitor?

16:23.076 --> 16:26.246
He's not a janitor.
That's the guy who trashed the theater.

16:26.329 --> 16:27.956
Really?

16:28.039 --> 16:29.332
Ooh.

16:29.416 --> 16:31.835
I love a man in a uniform.

16:41.261 --> 16:42.512
Hey.

16:42.595 --> 16:46.057
You with the garbage-man jumpsuit.
How about a wash and wax?

16:46.141 --> 16:49.477
Cool out.
I know that car belongs to somebody.

16:49.561 --> 16:52.522
We'll leave it here
for you to drive over to Omar's.

16:52.605 --> 16:55.400
And make sure he pays
for the last car we brought him.

16:55.442 --> 16:56.443
Whassup, man?

16:56.526 --> 17:00.447
Man, look at this thing.
I think it's got plastic spinners.

17:01.990 --> 17:03.533
What's up with the girls here?

17:03.616 --> 17:06.828
Damn. They look like the girls
from the "Candy Shop" videos.

17:06.911 --> 17:10.040
They might look like 'em,
but they don't dance like 'em.

17:10.123 --> 17:12.541
Oh, yeah? So, you been
workin' 'em out?

17:12.625 --> 17:15.795
I been workin' 'em out.
I been givin' 'em something like...

17:15.878 --> 17:18.173
Whassup?
That's what you showed 'em?

17:21.968 --> 17:23.678
Hey, yo.

17:23.762 --> 17:24.971
- OK.
- Whoo!

17:25.055 --> 17:28.098
- That's whassup?
- And what they do?

17:28.183 --> 17:30.310
Be like twinkle-toes.

17:30.393 --> 17:32.312
Aah! Ha-ha!

17:37.651 --> 17:39.235
What'd you do after that?

17:39.319 --> 17:43.490
Can you please stop thinking about
the senior showcase for one second?

17:43.573 --> 17:48.036
- It's not just that. It's everything...
- Nora. Nora! Look.

17:48.119 --> 17:52.999
Got a track for the showcase. It's the same
tempo, same rhythm as the track you got,

17:53.083 --> 17:57.003
but I really believe this'll take
your routine to the next level.

17:57.087 --> 17:59.798
- Next level?
- Yeah.

17:59.881 --> 18:03.176
- Thanks a lot, Miles.
- Nora, listen, wait.

18:03.259 --> 18:07.555
- Not that it's not already at the next level...
- Quit while you're ahead. Stop.

18:07.639 --> 18:11.309
I need you to stop and take a breath.
You're startin' to make me nervous.

18:11.351 --> 18:14.312
- I know. I'm just stressed.
- You need a break.

18:14.354 --> 18:18.024
Colin's playin' Saturday night.
You haven't been there forever.

18:18.108 --> 18:21.194
- Hold on. Who's Colin?
- Lucy's older boyfriend.

18:21.277 --> 18:24.656
- He's sophisticated. A real man.
- Sophisticated? Real man?

18:24.698 --> 18:29.035
His butt's gonna be surrounded
by a lot of real men when he goes to jail.

18:29.119 --> 18:32.038
How long have you had your license -
six months, seven?

18:32.122 --> 18:35.917
I am very mature for my age.
Thank you.

18:36.001 --> 18:38.962
That's great.
That's so perfect for the witness stand.

18:43.008 --> 18:45.343
# You can get with this
or you can get with that

18:45.385 --> 18:48.305
# I think you'll go with this,
'cause this is kinda phat

18:48.388 --> 18:50.473
# Engine, Engine Number 9

18:50.557 --> 18:53.018
# On the New York Transit Line

18:53.101 --> 18:55.145
# If my train goes off the track

18:55.228 --> 18:57.439
# Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up

18:57.522 --> 18:59.941
# Back on the scene,
crispy and clean

19:00.025 --> 19:02.610
# You can try, but don't
'cause you can't intervene

19:02.694 --> 19:05.155
# We be the outcast
down for the settle

19:05.238 --> 19:07.324
# One play rock,
one play the pebble

19:07.407 --> 19:12.203
# Open the door, you best believe
we're slidin' through it swift... ly

19:12.245 --> 19:15.540
# Niftily,
we can make it hip to be

19:15.582 --> 19:17.917
# What we are
'cause what we be

19:18.001 --> 19:21.421
# Be the epitome,
doo da dippity

19:21.463 --> 19:24.049
# So now I dwell
just to say you're plainer

19:24.090 --> 19:26.426
# Hold your cup
'cause I got the container

19:26.509 --> 19:28.678
# Pass the plate up,
cross the fader

19:28.762 --> 19:31.222
# Black Sheep get played
like a Sony innovator

19:31.306 --> 19:33.016
# Never the traitor...

19:33.099 --> 19:35.226
When are you gonna
stop changin' her music?

19:35.268 --> 19:38.063
- I'm just tryin' to help her.
- Nora, come on.

19:38.104 --> 19:40.732
Just go. Just go.

19:40.815 --> 19:42.233
Please, come on.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.616
Hey, man, what you doin'?

19:51.743 --> 19:54.162
- Come on, man.
- They got that.

19:54.245 --> 19:57.082
- Tired of gettin' dogged on yet?
- Oh, yeah. Let's go.

19:57.123 --> 19:58.124
Whassup?

19:58.208 --> 19:59.542
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:00.752 --> 20:02.879
- Bounce!
- Throw that, Tyler!

20:02.963 --> 20:04.923
Ha!

20:05.548 --> 20:06.883
A'ight.

20:06.967 --> 20:08.802
Pick 'em up,
pick 'em up.

20:08.885 --> 20:10.762
Come on, man.
Come on.

20:10.804 --> 20:12.973
Hey, man,
put me down.

20:13.056 --> 20:15.141
- Come on, man.
- Ah-ha-ha!

20:15.225 --> 20:17.018
- Get off me!
- You playin', baby?

20:20.313 --> 20:22.899
- Go!
- Mac. Mac.

20:23.817 --> 20:25.819
Got him. Got him! Get him.

20:25.860 --> 20:27.946
Ohh!

20:28.446 --> 20:29.406
Whoo!

20:29.489 --> 20:32.575
- Put my money here, baby.
- Hey, baby. Nice game.

20:36.496 --> 20:39.874
That's wonderful, Jack.
Congratulations.

20:40.375 --> 20:42.794
- You're late.
- Not really.

20:43.128 --> 20:46.798
You're so eager to get to work
you're sprinting off to the supply closet?

20:46.881 --> 20:50.093
It's 15 minutes.
Don't I get a grace period or something?

20:50.552 --> 20:56.266
You've neither earned one, nor are you
entitled. But you can stay 15 minutes later.

21:05.358 --> 21:07.485
Andrew, oh, my God.
What happened?

21:07.569 --> 21:09.571
Came down on my ankle wrong
in class today.

21:09.654 --> 21:12.490
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. It's just a sprain.

21:12.574 --> 21:16.077
Doctor says I have to stay off of it.
I'm really sorry.

21:16.161 --> 21:19.080
- For what? It's not your fault.
- I know, Nora.

21:19.164 --> 21:21.916
It's just that the showcase
means a lot to both of us.

21:22.000 --> 21:25.211
Maybe you could find someone
to rehearse with in the meantime.

21:25.253 --> 21:28.048
I should be back before you know it.

21:28.089 --> 21:29.549
Yeah. Um...

21:29.591 --> 21:32.093
Don't worry about it.
I'll be OK.

21:32.135 --> 21:35.430
All right.
Cool. I'll see you later.

21:35.472 --> 21:37.474
OK.

22:37.158 --> 22:40.495
- What's up, man?
- 'Sup?

22:41.204 --> 22:45.166
- Hey, where you from?
- I grew up in McCulloh Homes.

22:45.208 --> 22:46.293
Oh, word.

22:46.334 --> 22:49.963
That's where my boy Mac is from.
He lives over at Heritage now, though.

22:50.005 --> 22:51.006
Oh, yeah?

22:51.089 --> 22:53.842
I don't live over there no more.
I live with my aunt now.

22:53.883 --> 22:56.219
I'll check you a little later, all right?

22:56.303 --> 22:57.679
- A'ight.
- A'ight.

22:57.762 --> 22:58.805
Later.

22:58.847 --> 23:02.976
He only has a bad sprain. I need someone
to rehearse with until he gets better.

23:03.018 --> 23:06.271
You know all the stuff
I have going on with the labels.

23:06.354 --> 23:08.398
How come Miles
can find the time to help me?

23:08.481 --> 23:12.861
No offense to Miles, but he's not involved
in every aspect of the music as I am.

23:12.902 --> 23:18.366
Look, all I need is somebody, Brett,
to rehearse with just for a couple of weeks.

23:18.408 --> 23:21.828
I wanna help you. You know I do.
I'm just so close with my music,

23:21.870 --> 23:24.789
I gotta give it everything I have right now.

23:24.873 --> 23:28.168
Look, you're gonna do great.
You always do.

23:29.210 --> 23:30.211
Yeah.

23:30.295 --> 23:32.339
All right, sweetie.

23:52.734 --> 23:56.071
Thank you guys so much
for coming to the audition.

23:56.154 --> 23:58.198
- Ready?
- No!

23:59.324 --> 24:01.409
Sorry. I'm not ready yet.

24:10.585 --> 24:11.795
Thank you.

24:15.590 --> 24:16.591
Next?

24:18.343 --> 24:20.679
Like this.

24:20.762 --> 24:22.681
Jump. See?

24:22.764 --> 24:25.183
- It's not that hard. OK?
- Yeah.

24:25.266 --> 24:27.435
Hold me. Great.

24:36.111 --> 24:37.070
No.

24:41.658 --> 24:43.743
Thank you.

24:44.661 --> 24:46.413
No! Oh!

24:48.289 --> 24:49.624
- Oh!
- I got it.

24:49.666 --> 24:52.502
- You did it.
- No, no, no...

24:53.044 --> 24:55.463
Thank you. Thanks.

25:12.814 --> 25:14.941
I'll do it.

25:15.608 --> 25:16.860
Do what?

25:16.943 --> 25:21.448
I don't know.
Whatever y'all were tryin' to do out here.

25:22.115 --> 25:24.617
You wanna lift me?
Are you kidding?

25:25.368 --> 25:28.538
Does it look like I'm kiddin'?

25:28.621 --> 25:33.376
OK, I get it. You're not gonna use me
to get out of cleaning the windows,

25:33.460 --> 25:35.503
even if you were capable of dancing.

25:35.587 --> 25:40.008
OK. I'm not trying to get out of anything
and I know you saw me the other day.

25:42.344 --> 25:46.973
Thank you,
but I can find someone else.

25:48.808 --> 25:49.934
OK.

25:50.018 --> 25:52.520
I was just tryin' to help.

25:56.024 --> 25:57.150
OK, wait.

26:02.155 --> 26:03.615
Catch me.

26:12.207 --> 26:13.583
Now what?

26:13.667 --> 26:15.168
Um, um...

26:15.251 --> 26:16.753
Put me down.

26:16.836 --> 26:19.130
No. What about
choreographing a solo?

26:19.214 --> 26:22.175
I don't have time to work out a solo.
Not a good one, anyway.

26:22.258 --> 26:24.469
Have you talked to the sophomores?

26:24.552 --> 26:27.639
I've auditioned a bunch of them.
None of them can handle it.

26:27.722 --> 26:31.851
My dance has a lot of lifts in it
and you know how hard the...

26:31.893 --> 26:36.564
- I can't believe there's no one else.
- None who have the time.

26:36.648 --> 26:39.275
And you say that he can dance?

26:39.359 --> 26:42.737
- He's adequate.
- Adequate?

26:42.821 --> 26:46.282
See, that's my concern.
He's not taking this seriously.

26:46.366 --> 26:48.743
Look, I'm sorry.

26:48.827 --> 26:53.873
It's just you all be talkin' about dancin'
like it's rocket science or something.

26:53.957 --> 26:57.043
It's just for a couple of weeks
until Andrew gets better.

26:57.127 --> 26:59.212
Yeah.

26:59.296 --> 27:02.841
This would be your risk, Nora.

27:02.924 --> 27:05.218
It's your senior piece.

27:05.260 --> 27:07.554
I know.

27:07.595 --> 27:10.265
Don't make me regret my decision.

27:13.351 --> 27:15.812
2:30 tomorrow.
Bring your tights.

27:16.813 --> 27:18.773
Tights? Wait, what?

27:18.815 --> 27:21.359
Aah!

27:21.443 --> 27:23.486
I'm gonna beat you.

27:25.030 --> 27:27.782
Anything interesting
happen in school today?

27:27.824 --> 27:28.950
Malcolm, enough.

27:29.034 --> 27:30.118
No.

27:30.201 --> 27:33.246
Sit down. Thank you.

27:33.288 --> 27:34.914
Eat.

27:38.960 --> 27:40.587
Mm...

27:41.796 --> 27:43.965
Anything special at school today?

27:44.049 --> 27:46.176
I found a rehearsal partner,

27:46.259 --> 27:50.639
so now I won't miss a beat
when Andrew gets back.

27:50.722 --> 27:56.061
Your applications arrived from Cornell
and Brown. I put them on your bed.

27:56.144 --> 27:59.773
Remember our deal, Nora.
If you don't get a job from the showcase,

27:59.814 --> 28:02.859
you go to school in the fall.

28:03.485 --> 28:06.112
OK.

28:28.969 --> 28:30.971
I'm not late.

28:31.054 --> 28:34.307
You're not dressed, either.
You can change in the bathroom.

28:38.561 --> 28:39.854
Done.

28:39.896 --> 28:44.150
- I asked you to bring tights.
- Do I look like I own tights?

28:44.192 --> 28:47.153
- Shoes?
- Move better with 'em on.

28:47.195 --> 28:49.781
Afraid you might slip and fall?

28:56.079 --> 28:59.374
- How you wanna do this?
- I'll start with a combination.

29:05.922 --> 29:07.465
OK.

29:07.549 --> 29:09.926
Step, knee, step, fan,

29:10.010 --> 29:14.389
step, turn, ball change, contract.

29:16.057 --> 29:19.060
- OK?
- Mm-hm.

29:19.144 --> 29:21.771
I'll take it slow.

29:21.855 --> 29:24.649
And... step, knee,

29:24.733 --> 29:27.360
step, fan, and...

29:27.402 --> 29:29.946
- You got that?
- Yeah.

29:30.030 --> 29:31.865
So, from the fan...

29:31.906 --> 29:35.493
turn, ball change, contract.

29:37.454 --> 29:40.248
OK. Um...

29:40.290 --> 29:42.250
Let's do it again.

29:42.334 --> 29:46.713
Five, six, seven, eight. Step, knee...

29:46.755 --> 29:48.173
Oh. My bad.

29:48.673 --> 29:52.552
No. Uh, so... Go.

29:52.594 --> 29:55.096
Step, knee, fan...

29:55.138 --> 29:57.599
Wow.

29:58.767 --> 30:01.061
He looks like the real deal.

30:01.102 --> 30:05.065
- Take a break. Grab a coffee with me.
- I can't. I have a lot to do.

30:05.106 --> 30:07.317
- That's for damn sure.
- Brett...

30:07.400 --> 30:11.905
- I'm sorry. You got a problem?
- No. No, I'm all about rehabilitation.

30:11.988 --> 30:15.784
- We could discuss this outside.
- Why do you think you're so tough?

30:15.867 --> 30:18.411
- Why don't you test me?
- OK, stop.

30:18.453 --> 30:21.373
Brett, everything's OK, all right?

30:21.456 --> 30:23.375
I'll meet you later.

30:24.876 --> 30:27.337
- OK.
- OK.

30:39.724 --> 30:41.935
- What?
- Again.

30:41.977 --> 30:43.478
And...

30:56.908 --> 30:58.326
Yo, Omar!

30:58.368 --> 31:00.787
Your boys are here, man!

31:06.001 --> 31:08.253
O, look what we got for you, man.

31:10.171 --> 31:12.507
Let's go, baby.

31:13.508 --> 31:16.428
- I heard you havin' a party on Friday.
- Mm-hm.

31:16.511 --> 31:19.639
- Yeah, you know we up in there.
- Uh-uh.

31:19.681 --> 31:23.351
You dudes is froze out,
especially after what happened last time.

31:23.435 --> 31:26.855
- What you mean, we froze out?
- I ain't start that. That was PJ.

31:26.938 --> 31:28.106
That ain't even right.

31:28.189 --> 31:31.651
We can take this car to Stuckey's.
Probably get more money, too.

31:31.693 --> 31:34.154
I'm sorry. Yeah.

31:34.195 --> 31:37.240
You could take this car to Stuckey's.

31:37.324 --> 31:43.204
You know something, Mac? You young
dudes ain't got no respect. No loyalty.

31:43.246 --> 31:47.709
Why don't you bring me a Escalade or
something to get back in my good graces?

31:47.792 --> 31:49.961
- We just got you this car.
- An Escalade.

31:50.045 --> 31:52.631
- We'll get you an Escalade.
- What did you say?

31:52.714 --> 31:55.842
- Nothin', man.
- Yeah, nothing.

31:55.884 --> 31:58.011
So, can I still come to the party?

31:58.053 --> 32:01.056
- Skinny, come on!
- He ain't say nothin' about me.

32:01.139 --> 32:05.352
He said y'all couldn't go to the party.
He didn't say nothin' about Skinny.

32:05.393 --> 32:07.020
Will you shut up?

32:07.062 --> 32:11.691
Ready? Down, up, step, turn.

32:11.733 --> 32:14.569
- Piqué and...
- What the hell is a piqué?

32:15.153 --> 32:17.155
This is a piqué.

32:17.238 --> 32:21.409
We do the turn
and land face to face, OK?

32:21.493 --> 32:23.036
- I get it...
- Do it again.

32:23.119 --> 32:24.913
- It's just...
- What?

32:24.996 --> 32:29.125
It's just stiff.
This whole thing is stiff. It's boring.

32:29.793 --> 32:31.378
Boring?

32:31.419 --> 32:34.965
Don't look at me like I'm stupid.
I know you know what I'm sayin'.

32:36.257 --> 32:39.219
Fine. Well, that's the way it is, so...

32:39.803 --> 32:40.971
Fine.

32:41.638 --> 32:43.431
Ready? And...

32:43.473 --> 32:44.891
Down, up...

32:44.933 --> 32:49.062
step, turn, piqué, and...

32:49.145 --> 32:51.439
- Like this?
- Um...

32:51.523 --> 32:53.441
OK, I am starving.

32:57.570 --> 32:59.864
Tyler's just here until Andrew's back.

32:59.948 --> 33:03.410
And why is this the first time
I'm hearin' about it?

33:05.453 --> 33:07.038
We still have work to do.

33:07.122 --> 33:09.040
Wait. I can't watch?
Is he that bad...?

33:09.124 --> 33:11.751
- Goodbye.
- You can tell me!

33:11.835 --> 33:14.421
OK.

33:19.843 --> 33:22.053
OK, um...

33:22.137 --> 33:25.765
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

33:25.807 --> 33:27.809
OK.

33:29.602 --> 33:32.981
Can you come to the club
and hear me sing with Colin on Saturday?

33:33.064 --> 33:34.983
Ooh, maybe you can bring Tyler.

33:35.066 --> 33:37.110
Can you stop talking
about how hot he is?

33:37.193 --> 33:42.157
OK, Brett's not around, so why do you
keep denying the obvious? It's so obvious.

33:42.198 --> 33:45.410
OK, fine. Tyler's good looking,
but he's annoying.

33:45.493 --> 33:49.289
See? Your guard's up,
and that must mean that you like him.

33:49.331 --> 33:52.292
- You couldn't be more wrong.
- Ooh!

33:52.334 --> 33:53.877
And defensive, too.

33:53.960 --> 33:57.964
You know, that must mean that you,
um... really, really like him.

33:59.674 --> 34:02.135
I'm just sayin'.

34:02.218 --> 34:04.804
Look. Miles sent me another MP3.

34:04.888 --> 34:06.014
Ugh.

34:06.097 --> 34:10.893
Better listen to it now. He'll call
in five minutes, askin' what you think.

34:10.976 --> 34:13.521
You've been gettin' on
Miles' case a lot lately.

34:13.605 --> 34:15.357
Because he's irritating.

34:15.440 --> 34:16.440
Ooh.

34:16.524 --> 34:21.154
- Defensive. What does that mean again?
- Just listen to the track, OK?

34:25.492 --> 34:27.911
Hm.

34:29.411 --> 34:31.039
It's good.

34:31.121 --> 34:33.875
Whatever.

34:33.958 --> 34:36.378
# Whoa-oa-oa

34:36.418 --> 34:41.007
# Step, step, step up
Step, step, step up

34:41.091 --> 34:42.967
- This.
- This is better.

34:43.051 --> 34:45.762
# You step up,
I'll step up, boy

34:45.844 --> 34:48.514
# 'Cause I'm tryin'
to be with you forever...

34:48.556 --> 34:50.976
# No matter what we go through

34:51.059 --> 34:53.395
# You step up,
I'll step up, too

34:53.436 --> 34:57.732
# It don't matter what the haters say
Long as you are my boo

34:57.774 --> 34:59.985
# No matter how hard it gets

35:00.068 --> 35:02.070
# This love will have no regrets

35:02.153 --> 35:05.865
# As long as when we steppin'
on the dance floor, it's me and you

35:05.907 --> 35:08.034
# The rhythm of the beat,
that's my heart

35:08.076 --> 35:10.412
# Cupid shot me
with an arrow from the start

35:10.495 --> 35:12.747
# It's your love
that's got me trapped

35:12.789 --> 35:14.874
# Every time I try to leave,
you bring me back

35:14.958 --> 35:18.795
# So much water,
at times I've cried a river...

35:18.878 --> 35:22.257
I'm so serious.
If you don't stop laughing...

35:22.841 --> 35:24.259
OK, no!

35:25.760 --> 35:27.387
- Are you serious?
- Ready?

35:27.429 --> 35:30.223
# You step up,
I'll step up, too...

35:31.766 --> 35:34.311
Whatever.

35:34.394 --> 35:36.021
I'm sorry.

35:36.104 --> 35:38.106
# This love will have no regrets

35:38.189 --> 35:42.235
# As long as when we steppin'
on the dance floor, it's me and you

35:42.277 --> 35:45.238
# When I step into place,
I feel my feet

35:45.280 --> 35:47.615
# Lifting from under me

35:47.699 --> 35:52.370
# You grab my hands,
spin me around and right before I fall

35:52.454 --> 35:54.331
# You catch me and you say

35:54.414 --> 35:58.209
# Just look into my eyes
and we will make another day

35:58.293 --> 36:02.756
# Boy, no matter what we go through,
this love will have no regrets...

36:02.797 --> 36:03.798
What next?

36:03.882 --> 36:05.925
Six, seven, eight.

36:08.345 --> 36:11.723
Piqué and grab...

36:11.806 --> 36:13.266
# No...

36:13.808 --> 36:15.894
# Boy, no matter...

36:15.977 --> 36:16.978
Turn, down.

36:17.062 --> 36:19.481
# You step up,
I'll step up, too

36:19.564 --> 36:21.775
# It don't matter
what the haters say

36:21.816 --> 36:23.777
# Long as you are my boo

36:23.818 --> 36:26.446
# As long as when we steppin'
on the dance floor

36:26.488 --> 36:29.115
# It's me and you

36:41.002 --> 36:42.963
Lena got Cap'n Crunch.

36:43.004 --> 36:46.841
Peanut butter Cap'n Crunch.
Told you she likes us.

36:46.925 --> 36:50.637
- Camille, would you get outta here?
- Fine.

36:50.679 --> 36:53.682
- It's not my fault!
- It is your fault...

36:53.765 --> 36:55.976
Camille, come here for a second.

36:56.017 --> 36:58.103
Shut up.

36:59.562 --> 37:01.856
You gonna give me a little bit of that?

37:03.566 --> 37:05.276
One bite.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.362
One. One bite.

37:09.030 --> 37:10.448
Hurry up.

37:10.532 --> 37:13.326
That was the biggest bite I've ever seen.

37:13.368 --> 37:15.745
Get your own.

37:16.746 --> 37:20.208
I spit on that spoon.
Yeah, now you give it back.

37:20.292 --> 37:21.710
What... What is this?

37:21.793 --> 37:24.421
- That's a sliding scale.
- What does that mean?

37:24.504 --> 37:27.632
That means I scored more points than you,
so I get more money.

37:27.716 --> 37:28.675
No, no, no.

37:28.758 --> 37:31.970
What about my assists?
I was droppin' dimes today.

37:32.053 --> 37:34.389
- You tripped over your own shoes.
- Twice.

37:34.431 --> 37:38.143
You rolled out of the second one.
You played it off cool.

37:38.226 --> 37:41.563
- You better give me some more money.
- What?

37:41.604 --> 37:43.815
It's getting late.
I gotta bounce.

37:43.898 --> 37:47.527
- Wait, hold on. We'll give you a ride.
- Yo, let me do it this time.

37:47.610 --> 37:51.114
- Skinny, you the lookout.
- Why can't I do it this time?

37:51.698 --> 37:53.742
- Can you do it?
- Yeah.

37:55.035 --> 37:56.828
Let him do it, then.

37:56.911 --> 37:59.372
You know what?

37:59.414 --> 38:01.875
Here you go, tough guy.

38:01.916 --> 38:04.794
See that car right there?
Go get 'em.

38:09.966 --> 38:12.927
- That car has got an alarm on it.
- I know.

38:22.437 --> 38:23.563
He failed.

38:33.281 --> 38:35.992
Yo, I told you that alarm
was gonna go off.

38:36.076 --> 38:38.745
Wait a minute.
Y'all set me up?

38:41.039 --> 38:42.707
Hold up. I got us one.

38:42.791 --> 38:45.961
You shoulda saw your face.

38:46.044 --> 38:47.420
Tsk.

39:06.940 --> 39:10.193
# Can't say I ever felt the way I felt

39:10.276 --> 39:11.903
- # When we were makin'...
- # Love

39:11.987 --> 39:14.698
# Can't stand the thought
that you were mine, but now you're...

39:14.781 --> 39:16.282
# For the takin'

39:16.324 --> 39:19.577
# I realize that we were one,
but now we're two

39:19.661 --> 39:24.874
# You traded us for something
just to pass the time, babe

39:26.084 --> 39:29.004
- That was good. Play it back, Miles?
- I like that.

39:32.007 --> 39:33.133
Nora.

39:33.216 --> 39:34.968
Yo, look who's here.

39:35.010 --> 39:36.636
Sorry, bro.
Closed studio.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.513
Yeah, OK, "bro".

39:38.596 --> 39:42.684
- You're an hour late.
- Yeah. My bad. I got caught up.

39:42.767 --> 39:43.935
For an hour?

39:44.019 --> 39:47.480
Yeah. I had things I had to do.
I'm sorry. Can't we rehearse now?

39:47.522 --> 39:50.984
No. There's other dancers
in the studio now. We can't.

39:51.067 --> 39:54.029
Why you gettin' mad at me?
I'm here every single day.

39:54.112 --> 39:56.656
- I said I'm sorry.
- Sorry's not gonna cut it.

39:56.740 --> 40:00.994
Yeah, we're workin' here, man.
Some of us take this seriously.

40:04.706 --> 40:05.707
Mm-hm.

40:41.576 --> 40:45.413
- Where were you?
- Where was I when?

40:45.455 --> 40:47.832
When we were supposed
to be rehearsing?

40:47.916 --> 40:51.586
I don't think the rehearsing thing
is gonna work out for me.

40:51.670 --> 40:55.799
- What the hell does that mean?
- That means I'm out.

40:55.882 --> 41:00.929
What?! Are you kidding me? You just quit
without even talking to me about it?

41:01.012 --> 41:03.390
Yeah, sorry.

41:03.431 --> 41:05.809
Look, I gotta get back to work.

41:05.892 --> 41:10.105
I can't believe this. I can't believe
I trusted you. That was so stupid.

41:10.146 --> 41:13.400
People make stupid decisions every day.

41:13.441 --> 41:17.278
Besides, it didn't look
like you needed me, anyway.

41:33.295 --> 41:35.588
Mac, get your feet off the table.

41:35.630 --> 41:37.757
Marcus, get your feet off my table.

41:38.300 --> 41:41.094
- Told you, boy.
- Mom!

41:41.136 --> 41:45.307
Don't leave this house. I don't wanna
hear about you getting into trouble.

41:45.390 --> 41:48.143
- We ain't goin' nowhere, Mom.
- That's right.

41:48.226 --> 41:51.646
I'll be back home in time
to make y'all's breakfast.

41:51.688 --> 41:54.232
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Mrs. Carter.

41:56.818 --> 41:57.944
Ah, man.

42:03.617 --> 42:05.910
Look, look, weak crossover.

42:06.870 --> 42:10.832
- You think you're as good as these guys?
- Please.

42:10.874 --> 42:12.709
Why don't you try out?

42:12.792 --> 42:14.210
- For the And1 team?
- Mm-hm.

42:14.294 --> 42:19.132
- Why would I need to do that for?
- You should play for the school team.

42:19.174 --> 42:20.467
The school team?

42:20.508 --> 42:24.804
- Yeah, right. They suck. Never.
- Maybe they wouldn't suck if you played.

42:24.846 --> 42:26.848
Is this part of your community service?

42:26.931 --> 42:31.478
What you gonna say next? "This is your
brain on drugs"? Man, forget with that.

42:33.772 --> 42:37.734
- I'm just sayin'...
- All right, man. Just drop it.

42:39.027 --> 42:43.865
Don't see you out tryin' to do nothin'.
You quit everything you start. You know it.

42:47.619 --> 42:51.873
- That's me right there.
- Put it in slow motion, too.

42:52.415 --> 42:54.960
Oh, baby...

42:59.881 --> 43:02.384
Nora?

43:03.009 --> 43:06.262
Where have you been?
It's getting late.

43:06.346 --> 43:07.931
Where do you think, Mom?

43:08.014 --> 43:10.892
You've been rehearsing a lot.
What about your schoolwork?

43:10.934 --> 43:15.522
Rehearsing is the most important part of
my schoolwork. It's kind of the whole point.

43:15.605 --> 43:18.650
Sweetie, I just don't think that dancing...

43:18.733 --> 43:20.860
Dancing is what?
What do you know about it?

43:20.944 --> 43:23.780
When was the last time
you saw me dance?

43:23.863 --> 43:26.533
That's not fair.

43:26.574 --> 43:29.369
You don't have to worry about it anymore.

43:29.411 --> 43:32.580
The guy I've rehearsed with
for the showcase quit today.

43:32.664 --> 43:35.292
So basically, I'm screwed.

43:37.085 --> 43:39.713
You might get your dream after all.

43:41.298 --> 43:43.842
You gotta come to rehearsal.

43:46.511 --> 43:49.055
Nora.

43:49.139 --> 43:52.475
Wait a minute.
Can you hold on a second?

43:52.559 --> 43:55.770
Look, I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about yesterday.

43:55.812 --> 44:01.526
- You don't feel like mopping floors today?
- Look, can you just give me a break?

44:01.609 --> 44:06.197
Do you have any idea how important this
showcase is? Who's going to be there?

44:06.281 --> 44:09.242
- I don't know. People?
- People?

44:09.784 --> 44:13.622
Important people from every
major dance company in the country.

44:13.663 --> 44:17.459
Without this showcase,
I have nothing. I go nowhere.

44:17.500 --> 44:22.464
OK. All right, I get it.
I know all about havin' nothin'. It sucks.

44:22.505 --> 44:25.008
- It does.
- So are we gonna go back to doin' this?

44:25.091 --> 44:26.593
- No.
- No?

44:26.676 --> 44:30.764
- I don't trust you.
- What do I gotta do to prove it to you?

44:31.598 --> 44:34.142
Look, I'll do anything.

44:35.602 --> 44:37.562
Anything?

44:37.646 --> 44:43.068
And up and grand plié
all the way to the ground.

44:43.151 --> 44:48.490
Back up and reach your arm up high.
Touch the sky.

44:48.573 --> 44:53.536
Down forward, touch your toes.
And back up.

44:55.664 --> 44:57.290
Shh!

44:57.749 --> 45:01.044
And pointe and second.

45:01.127 --> 45:03.797
And plié...

45:03.838 --> 45:05.966
Good. Plié...

45:06.049 --> 45:08.009
Shh!

45:08.468 --> 45:10.845
I thought she was gonna
slap me in my face.

45:11.763 --> 45:13.723
Well, this is me.

45:13.807 --> 45:18.812
OK. Why are you teachin' ballet class?
It doesn't look like you need a job.

45:18.895 --> 45:22.482
Oh, you know, it just puts off
coming home a little longer.

45:22.565 --> 45:24.985
It couldn't be that bad.

45:25.860 --> 45:28.196
My mom doesn't get
the whole dancing thing.

45:28.279 --> 45:31.199
- What about your dad?
- He died a couple years ago.

45:32.450 --> 45:35.620
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's OK.

45:36.371 --> 45:38.456
He was the one
who always encouraged me.

45:38.540 --> 45:41.501
Driving me to rehearsals,
watching all my routines.

45:42.168 --> 45:43.837
Sounds like a cool dude.

45:45.547 --> 45:49.384
- Thanks for walking me home.
- All right. Later.

45:49.426 --> 45:51.511
Bye.

45:52.929 --> 45:56.725
Pickup game tomorrow at the courts.
Them cats want a rematch. You down?

45:56.808 --> 46:01.688
I can't make that. I got community service
every day this week, man.

46:03.648 --> 46:06.192
Hey, put that away.
What are you doin'?

46:06.943 --> 46:10.572
Whassup between you and Lucy?
Look like she's kind of feeling you.

46:10.655 --> 46:13.366
- I don't know about that.
- What, you scared?

46:13.408 --> 46:16.077
Luce, Colin is too old for you.
What are you doing?

46:16.161 --> 46:18.079
- It was so...
- Cheesy?

46:18.163 --> 46:20.832
Romantic, OK?
It was romantic...

46:22.083 --> 46:26.004
- Why isn't Nora using this?
- Nora's old-school, man.

46:26.087 --> 46:30.884
I ain't talkin' Sugarhill Gang.
I'm talkin' 'bout Vivaldi old-school. For real.

46:30.925 --> 46:35.263
You should let her listen to it.
Hey, Nora. I want you to hear somethin'.

46:35.347 --> 46:38.892
- Don't start.
- You guys seem to be gettin' along well.

46:38.975 --> 46:42.312
- He's my partner.
- Ah, he's just your partner.

46:42.937 --> 46:44.606
And too many things.

46:45.857 --> 46:50.195
Miles got... What's that, violin?
Some kids to play violin on the track.

46:50.278 --> 46:53.239
Finally working with people
that can play instruments.

46:53.323 --> 46:57.452
I can play, all right.
I just prefer to play with myself.

46:57.535 --> 46:58.787
Whoa. What?

46:59.621 --> 47:03.416
- He makes it too easy.
- No, not play with...

47:03.458 --> 47:04.876
Just listen.

47:13.051 --> 47:15.095
I like it.

47:15.178 --> 47:18.723
I really like it. It's good.

47:18.807 --> 47:22.727
Told you, dawg.
Hey, I was thinkin', um...

47:22.811 --> 47:25.730
You know that turn
where we have our legs behind us?

47:25.814 --> 47:29.275
Thinkin', you know,
what if I went down,

47:29.359 --> 47:31.945
and then we, like,
change levels, like?

47:32.028 --> 47:34.406
I just... I don't mean to be out of line...

47:34.489 --> 47:36.825
No, no. It's cool.

47:37.409 --> 47:39.828
I like it.
Let's try it. Ready?

47:39.869 --> 47:41.997
Five, six, seven, eight.

47:42.080 --> 47:45.959
One, two, three, four.

47:46.334 --> 47:48.837
- That's actually really good.
- Cool.

47:48.878 --> 47:51.381
I think we should do it.

47:51.464 --> 47:54.342
Let's try it again.
Five, six, seven, eight.

47:57.846 --> 48:00.765
I guess I'll just see you tomorrow, then.

48:00.849 --> 48:02.934
- OK.
- All right.

48:05.020 --> 48:07.647
You need a ride?

48:07.731 --> 48:09.107
Um...

48:09.190 --> 48:11.192
You ever even been out to Hampden?

48:11.818 --> 48:14.237
No, but there's a place I go near there.

48:21.536 --> 48:24.080
I'm serious.
Where are you takin' me?

48:24.164 --> 48:26.791
Hold on.
I'm about to show you.

48:26.875 --> 48:29.586
Hold it. Is this...
Is this where you kill me?

48:29.669 --> 48:31.254
Funny.

48:37.594 --> 48:39.429
This is it.

48:46.561 --> 48:48.688
Yeah. I mean...

48:48.772 --> 48:52.150
I got a view just like this,
you know, from my balcony.

48:52.233 --> 48:55.695
- You do?
- No.

48:55.779 --> 49:00.992
- How did you find this place?
- I been comin' here since I was a kid.

49:01.076 --> 49:05.246
My dad was an executive
at one of the shipping companies.

49:05.747 --> 49:08.208
This is where
I imagined my whole routine.

49:08.249 --> 49:10.669
I don't know how you do it.

49:10.752 --> 49:15.548
How you think about
how two people are gonna move and...

49:15.590 --> 49:19.636
I don't know, every detail.
I couldn't do that.

49:19.719 --> 49:23.098
- You've been doing it.
- It's not the same thing, though.

49:23.181 --> 49:25.433
That's how it starts.

49:26.434 --> 49:29.562
I always saw this routine
with a bunch of other dancers.

49:29.604 --> 49:31.439
What do you mean?

49:31.523 --> 49:36.569
Well, if I had enough dancers,
I could have them all starting in unison

49:36.653 --> 49:38.780
and then slowly
breaking out in a canon.

49:38.863 --> 49:40.031
Whoa, what's...

49:40.115 --> 49:43.785
- What's a canon?
- You know, like "Row Your Boat"?

49:46.329 --> 49:50.625
OK, I'll show you. You know
that phrase with the turn and lift?

49:51.167 --> 49:53.545
They all have turn and lifts.

49:55.380 --> 49:58.800
All right, what, in the middle section?
Yeah, I know it.

49:58.842 --> 50:02.137
Instead of doing it together,
you're gonna go first.

50:03.763 --> 50:05.557
- Come on.
- All right.

50:06.975 --> 50:08.601
OK, go on "one".

50:08.685 --> 50:10.687
Five, six, seven, eight.

50:10.770 --> 50:13.356
- # When I'm with you
- # When I'm with you

50:13.440 --> 50:16.318
# You know you make my days

50:16.359 --> 50:19.237
# So beautiful

50:19.321 --> 50:22.699
# With your different ways

50:22.782 --> 50:25.660
- # You make me lighter
- # Yeah

50:25.744 --> 50:28.788
- # I'm movin' with the wind
- # Movin' with the wind

50:28.830 --> 50:33.460
# Love, you know what you've got for me,
I've got for you, too

50:33.543 --> 50:35.712
# We can't pretend

50:35.795 --> 50:38.381
# Give me another chance to breathe in

50:39.007 --> 50:41.509
# You got all the things I need and

50:41.593 --> 50:44.679
# Together, we're just so complete

50:44.763 --> 50:47.807
# You must be the reason I'm alive

50:47.849 --> 50:49.434
# Give me another chance...

50:49.517 --> 50:51.061
Um...

50:51.144 --> 50:53.980
# You got all the things I need and

50:54.022 --> 50:56.524
# Together, we're just so complete...

50:56.566 --> 50:59.402
Um... I, um...

50:59.486 --> 51:03.990
If you saw it with a bunch of dancers,
you should do it with a bunch of dancers.

51:04.074 --> 51:06.451
Where would I find these dancers?

51:06.534 --> 51:10.622
You go to a school bustin' with
kids in tights. Take your pick.

51:10.705 --> 51:15.168
The only ones left are sophomores
and freshmen. They're not good enough.

51:15.210 --> 51:18.338
How do you know
if they're good enough or not?

51:18.380 --> 51:21.216
You didn't know I was good enough.

51:21.299 --> 51:23.468
Well, who says you are?

51:26.972 --> 51:29.724
All right...

51:31.768 --> 51:33.395
Uh-huh.

51:34.938 --> 51:37.190
I'm being kept in the ninth grade.

51:37.232 --> 51:39.484
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

51:39.567 --> 51:42.737
- Let's go. You ready?
- I can't. I'm late for my hours.

51:42.821 --> 51:45.240
- What about our game?
- I'll do it tomorrow.

51:45.282 --> 51:47.909
You said that yesterday.

51:47.993 --> 51:50.036
Yo, I'm gonna catch y'all later.

51:51.454 --> 51:53.790
Now I'm gettin' pissed.

52:00.255 --> 52:02.382
How many did you say you needed?

52:27.490 --> 52:29.784
Thanks, Miles.

52:31.786 --> 52:34.873
So, um, that's basically
what we have so far.

52:35.457 --> 52:38.084
Congratulations.

52:38.126 --> 52:40.378
You've really expanded your range.

52:40.879 --> 52:43.632
I thought your original piece was good,

52:43.715 --> 52:45.759
but this...

52:45.842 --> 52:48.970
This is very risky, Nora.

52:49.054 --> 52:53.224
But it may pay off. What made you
decide to change your piece?

52:53.308 --> 52:57.270
- Actually, a lot of this is Tyler.
- Nah, it's all you.

52:57.312 --> 53:01.274
OK, fine. He gave me some of his moves
and I gave him ballet lessons.

53:01.316 --> 53:03.943
You've studied ballet?

53:03.985 --> 53:07.614
He's actually pretty good.
He could be a student here.

53:07.656 --> 53:11.993
Unfortunately, our school year has
already begun, but keep up the good work.

53:20.335 --> 53:22.462
Mm, Miles. Miles!

53:22.545 --> 53:26.174
- Lucy, not right now.
- What's wrong? Miles.

53:26.257 --> 53:29.469
Miles, what's wrong?
I heard you guys got signed.

53:29.511 --> 53:32.430
- You heard wrong.
- Everybody says Brett got signed...

53:32.514 --> 53:36.184
- Brett signed without me.
- How'd he get signed without you?

53:36.267 --> 53:38.937
According to him,
the label says he's the only talent.

53:39.020 --> 53:42.607
They wanna put him out as a solo artist
to work with other producers.

53:42.691 --> 53:44.651
- Oh, my God...
- You know what?

53:44.734 --> 53:46.820
I knew Brett had an ego.
I knew he did.

53:46.903 --> 53:50.657
But, damn, I thought he would sit me down
and tell me like a man.

53:58.415 --> 53:59.874
I knew it.

54:05.338 --> 54:06.673
Hey, baby.

54:06.715 --> 54:09.092
Is that why you flew
to New York last week?

54:09.175 --> 54:10.385
Nora, calm down.

54:10.468 --> 54:16.349
You ditched Miles? After all the work you
did together, you dump him just like that?

54:16.391 --> 54:19.102
You haven't heard my side of the story.

54:19.185 --> 54:23.690
You don't have time to tell your girlfriend.
I have to find out through everyone else.

54:23.773 --> 54:27.652
Nora, come on. I'm sorry.
I didn't expect it to happen like this.

54:27.736 --> 54:31.489
It's just happening. All right?
Like we always talked about.

54:31.573 --> 54:34.409
We never talked about
stepping on our friends.

54:34.451 --> 54:37.746
When you're handed your dream,
you take it. You don't ask questions.

54:37.829 --> 54:39.748
- I would.
- You think you would.

54:39.831 --> 54:42.250
But you don't know
until it's right in front of you.

54:42.334 --> 54:45.086
Seriously, would you
have walked away?

54:46.254 --> 54:48.757
I don't know...

54:48.798 --> 54:50.967
but I'm walking away now.

54:51.051 --> 54:53.345
- You're breaking up with me?
- Yes.

54:53.428 --> 54:57.557
This isn't about me or Miles or any of that.
It's about Tyler, isn't it?

54:57.599 --> 54:59.768
No, it's about me, Brett.

55:00.894 --> 55:02.187
Fine.

55:02.270 --> 55:05.899
Remember, that loser's
headed nowhere fast and you know it.

55:16.451 --> 55:18.578
Miss Gordon...
I mean, Director Gordon?

55:18.662 --> 55:21.414
Can I help you, Tyler?

55:21.456 --> 55:22.666
Um...

55:22.749 --> 55:26.002
There's something
that I kinda wanted to, um...

55:29.297 --> 55:32.759
- It's probably stupid.
- Then perhaps it can wait.

55:32.801 --> 55:36.137
You know how me and Nora
have been working together?

55:36.179 --> 55:42.102
It's been... kinda making me think lately
that... maybe I'd like to come here.

55:43.812 --> 55:48.400
- You want to apply to the school?
- Yeah. Kids transfer, don't they?

55:48.483 --> 55:53.822
I was kinda hopin' maybe I could
finish out my school year here.

55:55.991 --> 55:59.661
It's not that you don't have talent, Tyler.

55:59.744 --> 56:03.415
But a lot of kids have talent.
It takes so much more than that.

56:03.498 --> 56:08.003
This is a grueling program. My students
work themselves into the ground every day

56:08.086 --> 56:12.924
just to get a fraction closer to their goals.
We're tough as hell on them in here,

56:13.008 --> 56:16.303
because we know what they're
going to face out there.

56:16.344 --> 56:19.180
Only kids that make it
are the ones prepared to fight.

56:19.264 --> 56:21.182
Yeah, I understand that.

56:21.266 --> 56:25.979
I'm not sure that you do,
not for something real.

56:26.021 --> 56:29.232
And I've already seen you
give up once already.

56:29.316 --> 56:33.320
- That's not gonna happen again.
- Saying the words doesn't make it so.

56:33.403 --> 56:35.363
Then tell me what I gotta do.

56:35.405 --> 56:38.908
I can't.
You have to show me.

56:38.992 --> 56:43.413
Show me that you want it,
really want it.

56:43.496 --> 56:47.375
You do that,
then we can talk.

56:49.711 --> 56:53.548
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have a 3:00.

57:02.557 --> 57:04.184
Unh...

57:05.602 --> 57:07.979
# Whoo-oo-oo

57:08.063 --> 57:10.523
# Whoo-oo-oo

57:10.565 --> 57:12.067
# I got this girl

57:12.108 --> 57:16.321
# And she's the only thing
that can drive me insane...

57:18.281 --> 57:21.409
Come on, man.
Will you snap out of it?

57:21.493 --> 57:25.205
All right, look, way I look at it,
Brett did you a favor.

57:25.288 --> 57:27.749
Your beats are hotter
than what he can do with 'em.

57:27.832 --> 57:31.252
# It's a crime to admit
that she ain't ten times legit

57:31.336 --> 57:33.588
# My friend,
she's hotter than shh...

57:33.672 --> 57:35.840
# Her sun is shinin' on me

57:35.924 --> 57:38.969
# Anybody that got somethin' so fine

57:39.052 --> 57:41.721
# Now's the time to acknowledge

57:41.805 --> 57:44.641
# Ohh, ooh...

57:44.766 --> 57:48.520
- Come on, man.
- I gotta sit up here and watch this Colin?

57:48.603 --> 57:52.315
Did we come here for him?
I thought we came here for Lucy.

57:52.399 --> 57:56.861
Is that who you been looking at?
He is kinda hot, in that weird way...

57:56.945 --> 57:58.780
Shut up, man. Shut up.

58:00.657 --> 58:03.952
# I got it made in the sun, baby

58:03.994 --> 58:08.331
# Made in the sun, sugar
Made in the sun, honey

58:11.960 --> 58:15.088
# Oh, baby

58:19.342 --> 58:22.470
Thank you. We're gonna take a break.
Be back in five.

58:22.554 --> 58:24.097
Sounds great, fellas.

58:27.559 --> 58:29.436
I gotta get up outta here, man.

58:29.477 --> 58:32.480
Hey, guys.
Have you met my boyfriend?

58:32.522 --> 58:34.232
Hey, man. I'm Colin.

58:34.316 --> 58:36.443
Tyler. Nice to meet you, man.

58:36.526 --> 58:38.278
- This is Miles.
- What's up, man?

58:38.361 --> 58:42.115
Miles. This is the guy
you told me about.

58:42.782 --> 58:45.493
She said you played.
Got a set up if you wanna join us.

58:45.577 --> 58:50.624
- Oh, no. I left my G4 at home, man.
- It's in his bag.

58:50.707 --> 58:52.500
Yeah?

58:52.584 --> 58:55.837
Come on, man,
we're set up. Ready, Luce?

58:55.920 --> 58:59.466
Dude think he slick trying to use
that reverse-psychology shit.

58:59.507 --> 59:02.177
- He seems kinda cool.
- That's part of his whole game.

59:02.260 --> 59:04.012
Man, just go play.

59:04.095 --> 59:06.097
- How are you?
- OK.

59:16.066 --> 59:18.860
- Hey.
- Hey.

59:18.902 --> 59:20.612
I didn't think you'd come...

59:20.695 --> 59:23.323
- That's exactly why I wanted to come.
- Yeah?

59:23.365 --> 59:26.326
- What are you doing here?
- Miles needed a wingman.

59:27.410 --> 59:28.662
Oh.

59:28.745 --> 59:31.706
What's he doing up there?

59:31.748 --> 59:34.334
Trying to be the bigger man.

59:35.210 --> 59:36.670
OK.

59:37.295 --> 59:39.965
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

59:40.048 --> 59:41.883
Is everybody ready?
Let's do this.

59:45.720 --> 59:49.516
# Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

59:49.557 --> 59:52.686
# Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah...

59:52.769 --> 59:54.521
# Yeah...

59:54.604 --> 59:56.356
I didn't know she could sing.

59:56.439 --> 59:59.734
In her words, she majors in dance
because she can already sing.

59:59.818 --> 01:00:05.198
# On the weekend, on the weekend
On the weekend, on the weekend

01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.366
Kill it, Miles.

01:00:07.409 --> 01:00:10.161
# Back again, hit the lights,
let the party begin...

01:00:10.245 --> 01:00:15.000
- So, are you gonna ask me to dance?
- Didn't know you can dance without tights.

01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:17.585
# And I think
I'm ready to go, hot...

01:00:17.669 --> 01:00:19.838
You don't know
what you got yourself into.

01:00:19.921 --> 01:00:22.257
# Everyone in line
and they're payin' a lot

01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.342
# Drop a Ben,
them drinks are rich

01:00:24.426 --> 01:00:28.179
# But the music is free
You want it, you love it

01:00:28.263 --> 01:00:30.348
# You need it,
you know you gotta have it

01:00:30.432 --> 01:00:33.059
# The music is playin'...

01:00:33.101 --> 01:00:34.436
What is that?

01:00:34.477 --> 01:00:39.065
# This is for the girls comin' from NYC
I'm feelin' you like you's family

01:00:39.107 --> 01:00:42.360
# And everybody down
from L.A. to D.C.

01:00:42.444 --> 01:00:44.112
Whoo!

01:00:44.195 --> 01:00:46.197
Come on.

01:00:46.281 --> 01:00:47.616
# Turn the volume up 3db

01:00:47.699 --> 01:00:50.160
# Get on the dance floor
where the music is free

01:00:50.243 --> 01:00:52.829
# Slip on until the dawn's gone with me

01:00:52.912 --> 01:00:55.332
# Slip on until the dawn's gone with me

01:00:55.415 --> 01:00:57.250
# While the music is free

01:00:57.292 --> 01:01:00.754
- # Slip on until the dawn's gone with me
- # On the weekend...

01:01:00.795 --> 01:01:04.966
Now all my ladies,
over to the front.

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:07.177
Show 'em what you got.

01:01:10.096 --> 01:01:14.601
# Ooh, hoo-ooh

01:01:14.684 --> 01:01:17.270
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, ooh

01:01:17.354 --> 01:01:19.272
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, ooh

01:01:19.314 --> 01:01:21.608
# Uh-huh, uh-huh, oo-ooh

01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:23.276
Fellas...

01:01:23.318 --> 01:01:24.778
move like that.

01:01:27.489 --> 01:01:29.491
# Uh...

01:01:41.086 --> 01:01:43.672
# Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:01:43.755 --> 01:01:46.758
# Uh-huh, uh-huh
Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:01:46.841 --> 01:01:49.135
- # I like that
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:01:49.177 --> 01:01:51.596
- # Can all my ladies say
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.723
- # All the fellas say
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:01:53.807 --> 01:01:55.809
- # Everybody say
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:01:55.892 --> 01:01:57.978
- # Come dance with me
- # Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:01:58.019 --> 01:02:00.146
# And the story goes just like this

01:02:00.188 --> 01:02:03.358
# We pack 'em in till the morning,
there'll be no lettin' off

01:02:03.441 --> 01:02:05.443
# Dollars droppin' onto the tabletop

01:02:05.527 --> 01:02:07.904
# You can shake your thing
and there ain't no cost

01:02:07.988 --> 01:02:12.033
- # This is for the girls comin' from NYC
- # I'm feelin' you like you's family

01:02:12.117 --> 01:02:16.538
- # And everybody down from L.A. to D.C.
- # Rockin' to the same old-school beat

01:02:16.621 --> 01:02:19.416
# This is for the kids
in the clubs and the street

01:02:19.499 --> 01:02:20.792
# Turn the volume up 3db

01:02:20.875 --> 01:02:23.837
# Get on the dance floor
where the music is free

01:02:23.878 --> 01:02:25.797
# Slip on until the dawn's
gone with me

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:29.968
- # This is for the girls comin' from NYC
- # I'm feelin' you like you's family

01:02:30.051 --> 01:02:34.556
- # And everybody down from L.A. to D.C.
- # Rockin' to the same old-school beat

01:02:34.639 --> 01:02:37.309
# This is for the kids
in the clubs and the street

01:02:37.392 --> 01:02:38.935
# Turn the volume up 3db

01:02:39.019 --> 01:02:41.521
# Get on the dance floor
where the music is free

01:02:41.563 --> 01:02:44.190
# Slip on until the dawn's gone with me

01:02:44.232 --> 01:02:46.610
# Slip on until the dawn's gone with me

01:02:46.693 --> 01:02:48.194
# While the music is free

01:02:48.278 --> 01:02:50.071
# Slip on until the dawn's gone with me

01:02:50.155 --> 01:02:52.532
# On the weekend,
on the weekend, yeah

01:02:59.623 --> 01:03:01.249
Come here, baby.

01:03:09.174 --> 01:03:11.051
Oh!

01:03:11.092 --> 01:03:14.179
I swear, I have never seen
that many people here before.

01:03:14.262 --> 01:03:17.891
Get used to it.
That was great.

01:03:19.267 --> 01:03:22.395
Come on, you guys.
Let's take a walk by the water.

01:03:22.437 --> 01:03:25.774
- Come on, let's walk.
- Let them go. Let them go.

01:03:33.281 --> 01:03:37.410
- You're gonna make me say it, aren't you?
- Make you say what?

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:41.998
- I know I been hatin' on Colin.
- Mm, yeah.

01:03:42.082 --> 01:03:44.250
But...

01:03:44.292 --> 01:03:47.963
He was good.
He was real good.

01:03:48.046 --> 01:03:50.715
For someone who's so sophisticated.

01:03:50.799 --> 01:03:53.343
Why you always gotta play?

01:03:55.178 --> 01:03:57.430
You were, um...

01:03:57.472 --> 01:03:59.474
pretty good yourself.

01:03:59.557 --> 01:04:03.311
Miles, a little bit.
Just... Yeah, just a little.

01:04:03.395 --> 01:04:05.814
I try to do what I do.

01:04:18.493 --> 01:04:20.578
Um...

01:04:21.663 --> 01:04:22.747
Um...

01:04:22.831 --> 01:04:25.166
Don't worry about it.

01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:27.168
- Lucy...
- I gotta go.

01:04:27.210 --> 01:04:30.088
I'm gonna go check our sound levels.

01:04:35.218 --> 01:04:39.306
That place is crazy.
Is it always like that?

01:04:39.389 --> 01:04:41.516
Yes.

01:04:41.599 --> 01:04:46.813
But tonight, Miles and Lucy
were on a whole other level.

01:04:46.896 --> 01:04:49.232
You weren't so bad yourself.

01:04:49.316 --> 01:04:52.402
Y'all know exactly what you want.

01:04:52.485 --> 01:04:56.072
Well, what about you?
What do you want?

01:04:56.156 --> 01:04:58.450
I don't know. Nothin'.

01:04:58.533 --> 01:04:59.868
Come on.

01:04:59.951 --> 01:05:03.496
What about when you were a kid?
All kids want something.

01:05:03.538 --> 01:05:05.206
I don't know.

01:05:05.290 --> 01:05:10.879
For me, it's just...
better not to want anything.

01:05:10.962 --> 01:05:15.383
That way, if it goes away
or... doesn't happen,

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.346
you know,
it just doesn't matter.

01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:24.517
But you want something now, right?

01:05:24.601 --> 01:05:28.521
Like... maybe to go to MSA?

01:05:30.231 --> 01:05:33.026
There's a lot of things

01:05:33.068 --> 01:05:35.820
that I want now
that I didn't used to.

01:05:35.904 --> 01:05:41.284
I even catch myself every once in a while
actually thinking I can have 'em.

01:06:08.395 --> 01:06:11.398
Please don't kick me out.
I brought you orange juice.

01:06:11.439 --> 01:06:14.567
Bill and Lena went out.
You're baby-sitting.

01:06:14.609 --> 01:06:16.111
Thank you.

01:06:16.903 --> 01:06:20.907
- Why are you always so tired lately?
- 'Cause I been working a lot.

01:06:20.949 --> 01:06:24.744
- Doin' what?
- Why do you ask so many questions?

01:06:24.786 --> 01:06:28.623
Never mind. Don't answer that.
Just go get Malcolm's shoes on.

01:06:28.665 --> 01:06:30.375
All right.

01:06:30.458 --> 01:06:33.336
Oh, throw it.

01:06:34.004 --> 01:06:35.463
Got it. You almost got it.

01:06:35.547 --> 01:06:38.466
Dancing? You can't dance.

01:06:38.508 --> 01:06:41.428
Who can't dance?
You never seen me dance.

01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:43.930
Then do somethin'.

01:06:43.972 --> 01:06:47.600
Do somethin'?
What you want me to do?

01:06:47.684 --> 01:06:50.854
What you want me to do?
Huh? Huh?

01:06:52.147 --> 01:06:55.483
- OK, it was fine. It was OK.
- OK.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.321
- What was that?
- Throw it.

01:06:59.404 --> 01:07:01.489
- Where'd you learn that?
- Nothing.

01:07:01.573 --> 01:07:05.869
I'm not throwing anything
until you show me what that was.

01:07:06.995 --> 01:07:10.582
Yeah, all right.
I get you with the little...

01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.752
All right.

01:07:13.835 --> 01:07:16.296
You can do that,
you can do this.

01:07:19.049 --> 01:07:20.383
OK.

01:07:20.467 --> 01:07:22.677
Hah, hah. What?

01:07:22.761 --> 01:07:25.555
- I love it. All right. So after that...
- Yeah?

01:07:25.639 --> 01:07:27.849
Hit, hit...

01:07:30.685 --> 01:07:31.978
OK, let's try it all.

01:07:32.020 --> 01:07:33.647
- You got the whole thing?
- Yeah.

01:07:33.688 --> 01:07:37.400
OK, all right. On "go".
One, two, three, go, all right?

01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:41.780
One, two, three, go.

01:07:41.863 --> 01:07:42.906
What?

01:07:42.989 --> 01:07:44.074
Hit, hit...

01:07:46.826 --> 01:07:47.994
Hey.

01:07:48.078 --> 01:07:51.665
Can you do "running man"?
You don't know about that.

01:07:51.748 --> 01:07:55.126
- Malcolm, can you do the "running man"?
- Yeah!

01:07:55.210 --> 01:07:57.337
Oh, yeah. What's up?

01:07:57.379 --> 01:08:00.548
- Here we go. He's doing it one-handed.
- Oh, oh.

01:08:00.632 --> 01:08:03.551
Whee.

01:08:03.635 --> 01:08:05.387
Whoo!

01:09:28.303 --> 01:09:29.720
This is you?

01:09:29.804 --> 01:09:32.057
Don't be mean.
I was a chubby kid.

01:09:35.143 --> 01:09:38.520
What are you saying? If I was
like that now, you wouldn't like me?

01:09:38.604 --> 01:09:41.441
No, I could deal
with the chubbiness.

01:09:41.483 --> 01:09:45.069
But if you were missing those front teeth,
I couldn't work with that.

01:09:45.153 --> 01:09:48.448
Thank you very much.

01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:53.286
I was thinking we should talk to
Director Gordon about using the showcase

01:09:53.328 --> 01:09:55.956
as your audition to get into the school.

01:09:58.208 --> 01:10:01.419
I don't know.
Do you think she'd go for that?

01:10:01.503 --> 01:10:04.297
It's about going after what you want, right?

01:10:15.016 --> 01:10:17.477
Mom. Um, hey.

01:10:17.519 --> 01:10:20.188
I-I didn't know you were home already.

01:10:20.272 --> 01:10:23.358
This is Tyler,
my rehearsal partner.

01:10:23.441 --> 01:10:27.654
Nice to meet you, Ms. Clark.
You have a beautiful home here.

01:10:27.696 --> 01:10:31.074
Thank you.
We certainly like it.

01:10:33.034 --> 01:10:37.664
I should probably get going, anyway.
Thanks for showing me those pictures.

01:10:37.747 --> 01:10:39.124
Yeah.

01:10:39.207 --> 01:10:41.668
It was nice to meet you.

01:10:54.222 --> 01:10:58.643
A'ight, here we go.
Ready? One, two, three, go.

01:10:58.727 --> 01:11:01.062
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11:01.146 --> 01:11:03.356
- What's up?
- Um...

01:11:03.398 --> 01:11:07.569
Look, about the other night -
you didn't tell anybody, did you?

01:11:07.652 --> 01:11:09.571
Nah. Uh-uh.

01:11:11.781 --> 01:11:15.869
You know, 'cause it's just
musicians, whatever.

01:11:15.952 --> 01:11:18.455
You ain't got nothin' to explain to me.

01:11:18.538 --> 01:11:22.042
What's wrong?
Why you talking to me like that?

01:11:22.083 --> 01:11:25.837
If you wanna be with someone
who doesn't appreciate what he's got,

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:29.382
that's 100% your business.

01:11:29.758 --> 01:11:34.471
I just thought you'd be smart enough
to know you deserve better.

01:11:37.265 --> 01:11:39.476
Excuse me.

01:11:44.189 --> 01:11:49.736
Ready back there? All right.
I wanna hit it hard. All right.

01:11:49.778 --> 01:11:55.033
Smooth it out even more than that.
Just want it to look pretty. All right, go.

01:11:55.116 --> 01:11:57.077
- Wait, hold up.
- Mac?

01:11:57.118 --> 01:12:00.580
Tell me I'm not seeing this, Ty.

01:12:01.456 --> 01:12:03.792
Mac.

01:12:04.918 --> 01:12:08.046
Hold on, Mac.
Yo, wait up a second.

01:12:09.631 --> 01:12:11.257
What you doin', man?

01:12:11.299 --> 01:12:15.637
What is that, Riverdancin'?
You gettin' down with your Irish roots now?

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.639
- It's not like that.
- Like what?

01:12:17.722 --> 01:12:22.352
- It's part of my community service.
- How is dancin' community service?

01:12:23.895 --> 01:12:24.980
It's complicated.

01:12:25.063 --> 01:12:27.857
- Explain to me. I ain't that stupid.
- Fine...

01:12:27.941 --> 01:12:30.819
You were s'posed to meet me
at the courts two hours ago.

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.823
I come over here and I see you
blowin' me off for this? This?

01:12:34.864 --> 01:12:39.494
You ain't been hangin' or callin' 'cause you
leapin' around with a bunch of rich kids?

01:12:39.577 --> 01:12:43.081
They're not all rich.
It's not like that.

01:12:43.164 --> 01:12:45.709
All right, Mac, hold on.
There's this girl.

01:12:45.792 --> 01:12:50.213
She asked me to rehearse with her
for this showcase thing. That's all.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.640
So you messin' around
with our friendship for a girl?

01:13:00.682 --> 01:13:03.518
So it's like that?

01:13:04.728 --> 01:13:07.981
- That's a relief, Ty.
- Come on, man.

01:13:33.214 --> 01:13:35.008
That's great.

01:13:35.050 --> 01:13:37.052
- Hey, Tyler.
- Hey.

01:13:37.093 --> 01:13:39.054
What, are you back?

01:13:39.095 --> 01:13:43.183
Yeah. Feelin' a lot better.
Thanks for fillin' in for me.

01:13:44.434 --> 01:13:46.728
- Can you give us a sec?
- Sure.

01:13:56.571 --> 01:13:57.530
Hey, guys.

01:13:57.614 --> 01:13:59.240
- Hey. Good?
- Definitely.

01:14:04.245 --> 01:14:07.624
I didn't think he was coming back.
He hasn't even been here.

01:14:10.001 --> 01:14:12.545
I don't know what to do.

01:14:12.629 --> 01:14:14.714
So he's back.

01:14:15.882 --> 01:14:18.301
Where does that leave me?

01:14:19.010 --> 01:14:23.723
- You don't have to say anything.
- Wait. What does that mean?

01:14:23.807 --> 01:14:29.229
I can't believe I bought into this bullshit.
You're really gonna turn your back on me?

01:14:29.271 --> 01:14:33.775
That's not what I'm doing, Tyler.
Andrew is a student here. He's a senior...

01:14:33.858 --> 01:14:37.320
You're just like Brett.
You use people then you dump 'em.

01:14:37.404 --> 01:14:41.533
Why are you making it sound like that?
It's not the same situation. You know it.

01:14:41.616 --> 01:14:46.037
So how is it not?!
Have I just been filling in for Andrew?

01:14:46.121 --> 01:14:47.914
That's not fair.

01:14:49.666 --> 01:14:52.127
I'm out.

01:14:52.210 --> 01:14:54.045
Tyler. Tyler, wait.

01:14:54.129 --> 01:14:58.967
Gimme a second to figure this out.

01:15:04.306 --> 01:15:08.018
# Ooh

01:15:09.561 --> 01:15:12.522
# Ooh-ooh-ooh-ohh

01:15:14.274 --> 01:15:16.818
# Oh

01:15:16.901 --> 01:15:21.072
# Softly as a child

01:15:21.156 --> 01:15:24.367
# Born in natural rain

01:15:26.828 --> 01:15:29.956
# I predict the seasons

01:15:29.998 --> 01:15:32.834
# To go unchanged

01:15:32.917 --> 01:15:35.795
# Sometimes in life

01:15:37.130 --> 01:15:41.509
# Don't go off runnin'
from what's new

01:15:42.969 --> 01:15:46.014
# I became somebody

01:15:46.097 --> 01:15:49.225
# Through lovin' you

01:15:49.309 --> 01:15:52.896
# Warm was the sun

01:15:52.979 --> 01:15:58.944
# That covered my body so

01:15:59.027 --> 01:16:02.113
# Reminded me of you...

01:16:02.197 --> 01:16:04.199
Hello.

01:16:04.282 --> 01:16:06.451
Hi. Is Tyler there?

01:16:06.534 --> 01:16:08.036
May I ask who's calling?

01:16:08.119 --> 01:16:10.163
It's Nora.

01:16:10.664 --> 01:16:12.582
Nora?

01:16:14.834 --> 01:16:17.504
No, he's not here.

01:16:18.213 --> 01:16:20.382
Yeah, um,
just tell him I called.

01:16:20.799 --> 01:16:21.800
OK.

01:16:21.883 --> 01:16:26.513
# Oh, I became somebody

01:16:26.596 --> 01:16:28.556
# Oh

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:30.600
# Oh-oh

01:16:30.684 --> 01:16:35.855
# Ooh-ooh-ooh

01:16:35.897 --> 01:16:38.525
That's it. Ball, change, up.

01:16:38.566 --> 01:16:41.194
To the left, to the right. Heads up.

01:16:41.236 --> 01:16:43.863
Inside, up.

01:16:43.905 --> 01:16:45.615
Easy, knee.

01:16:48.159 --> 01:16:49.744
Look up.

01:16:49.828 --> 01:16:51.871
Up, play right.

01:16:54.541 --> 01:16:56.751
All right, thanks.

01:16:57.585 --> 01:16:59.754
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:16:59.838 --> 01:17:01.923
One and two, three, four. Up.

01:17:02.007 --> 01:17:03.466
Aah.

01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:06.761
- Andrew, are you all right?
- I don't know.

01:17:06.845 --> 01:17:08.221
Oh.

01:17:08.263 --> 01:17:10.390
OK, try walking on it.

01:17:13.602 --> 01:17:16.646
- I can't do this, Nora.
- What?

01:17:17.105 --> 01:17:19.899
You and I both know
I can't pull this routine off.

01:17:30.619 --> 01:17:33.204
Here, Mom.

01:17:33.288 --> 01:17:35.248
Nora...

01:17:40.629 --> 01:17:42.714
- Bet you can't make the shot.
- Bet you I can.

01:17:42.797 --> 01:17:44.966
- Whatever.
- Yeah, right, whatever.

01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:47.260
Let me do it.

01:17:47.344 --> 01:17:49.429
You suck, man.

01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:54.142
Hey, yo, Ty.

01:17:55.185 --> 01:17:56.770
- Man, what's up?
- What's up?

01:17:56.811 --> 01:17:59.773
- Where you been, man?
- You know, around.

01:18:01.274 --> 01:18:04.778
Gimme my ball back.
Ain't you gonna be late for ballerina class?

01:18:04.819 --> 01:18:07.614
No, man.
I'm through with that.

01:18:07.697 --> 01:18:11.534
- So what happened with that girl?
- Nothin'.

01:18:11.993 --> 01:18:16.957
- Nothin'? I'm supposed to believe you?
- Yeah, man, you are.

01:18:18.458 --> 01:18:20.877
I dunno.
Man that turns his back on his boy...

01:18:20.961 --> 01:18:23.421
Deserves a second chance.

01:18:23.838 --> 01:18:26.132
Right?

01:18:26.174 --> 01:18:27.968
Come on, Mac.

01:18:31.596 --> 01:18:33.765
Party tomorrow night at Omar's, man.

01:18:33.848 --> 01:18:35.266
Ha-ha-ha.

01:18:35.350 --> 01:18:37.686
That's my man.

01:18:37.727 --> 01:18:38.979
Uh-oh.

01:18:39.062 --> 01:18:40.772
And boogie...

01:18:42.023 --> 01:18:44.067
Got it, got it, got it.

01:18:45.694 --> 01:18:48.029
Come on, man.

01:18:54.077 --> 01:18:56.204
Mom?

01:18:56.288 --> 01:18:57.998
Are you OK?

01:18:58.081 --> 01:19:03.044
Do you know even when you were a baby
you danced better than you could walk?

01:19:03.128 --> 01:19:05.964
It was all you ever wanted to do.

01:19:06.047 --> 01:19:11.928
I remember the look on your face the day
we took you to your first dance class.

01:19:12.012 --> 01:19:14.014
You do?

01:19:18.810 --> 01:19:24.524
I never expected that dancing would still
bring you such joy after all these years.

01:19:25.775 --> 01:19:31.531
Seeing you up there on the stage
so happy - it used to make me happy.

01:19:33.617 --> 01:19:37.245
- I guess I forgot about that.
- Mom, it's OK.

01:19:37.329 --> 01:19:43.418
I am so excited
to see you dance in your showcase.

01:19:43.501 --> 01:19:45.420
Oh. Mom...

01:19:45.462 --> 01:19:47.756
I don't even have a partner anymore.

01:19:47.839 --> 01:19:50.675
Tyler's not doing it and Andrew's out.

01:19:50.759 --> 01:19:52.469
Baby...

01:19:54.262 --> 01:19:56.306
You can do this.

01:19:56.389 --> 01:19:59.684
You've been doing this
by yourself your whole life.

01:19:59.768 --> 01:20:01.227
Come here.

01:20:02.395 --> 01:20:05.357
You are gonna be great.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:07.567
Thanks, Mom.

01:20:11.529 --> 01:20:14.282
- I'm still gonna win.
- We'll see.

01:20:15.951 --> 01:20:17.410
That's why I'm beating you.

01:20:17.494 --> 01:20:20.080
Yeah, a'ight, whatever.
I'm gonna come back.

01:20:20.163 --> 01:20:24.125
- What y'all up to tonight?
- We goin' to Omar's to watch movies.

01:20:24.209 --> 01:20:25.418
Yeah.

01:20:25.502 --> 01:20:30.090
I know all about your movies.
You stayin' here, you understand?

01:20:30.131 --> 01:20:32.717
What?! Ma... I got to go last time.

01:20:32.801 --> 01:20:36.179
Yeah, I know, and that's why
you staying here tonight.

01:20:36.805 --> 01:20:39.140
You boys make sure
my baby don't go nowhere.

01:20:39.224 --> 01:20:40.809
- All right, Ma.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:20:42.811 --> 01:20:45.647
- I'll tuck you in before we leave.
- Shut up.

01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:47.274
# Let's go!

01:20:49.901 --> 01:20:52.946
All these girls and he don't wanna dance.

01:20:56.741 --> 01:20:58.368
Huh? Huh?

01:21:03.039 --> 01:21:05.625
Yo, yo, here's the man.

01:21:06.334 --> 01:21:08.461
What's up, T?

01:21:08.503 --> 01:21:10.130
- What's goin' on, man?
- Nada.

01:21:10.171 --> 01:21:12.674
I'm good. So this
your man's spot right here?

01:21:12.716 --> 01:21:14.050
Yeah, man.

01:21:14.134 --> 01:21:15.427
It's tight.

01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:16.761
Yeah, right.

01:21:16.845 --> 01:21:19.139
So, I don't know,
what's been goin' on?

01:21:19.639 --> 01:21:22.475
Everything cool.
Nora's good.

01:21:22.517 --> 01:21:23.643
Yeah?

01:21:23.685 --> 01:21:26.438
- Andrew quit, though.
- What you mean, he quit?

01:21:26.521 --> 01:21:29.482
He got hurt.
He can't dance with her anymore.

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:33.612
Damn.

01:21:33.695 --> 01:21:36.197
- I don't know. Whatever.
- Yeah, whatever.

01:21:36.281 --> 01:21:40.702
Why don't you stop the bullshit? I bet you
been mopin' around as much as she has.

01:21:40.785 --> 01:21:44.497
- She been mopin'?
- I ain't sayin' nothin', man.

01:21:44.539 --> 01:21:47.042
- Did you see a tear?
- Nah.

01:21:47.542 --> 01:21:48.918
Mopin'.

01:21:49.002 --> 01:21:51.296
Shut up. Let me
introduce you to somebody.

01:21:51.379 --> 01:21:53.506
- All right, my man C.
- What's up?

01:21:53.590 --> 01:21:56.343
My boy Mac.
Mac, this is Miles. Miles, Mac.

01:22:18.406 --> 01:22:23.620
I started tearin' up like a little girl tellin'
them that I go to the School of the Arts.

01:22:23.703 --> 01:22:26.748
- Wait, hold up. You go to MSA?
- Yeah.

01:22:26.831 --> 01:22:28.750
- That's how you know each other?
- Yeah.

01:22:28.792 --> 01:22:30.752
Yeah, exactly.

01:22:31.628 --> 01:22:34.130
You don't look like
no art-school cat to me.

01:22:34.214 --> 01:22:36.883
What's an art-school cat
supposed to look like?

01:22:36.967 --> 01:22:41.721
Miles Davis, Tupac, Mobb Deep -
those cats went to art school.

01:22:42.347 --> 01:22:46.184
- I'm just sayin'...
- You know what? Just shut up.

01:22:46.268 --> 01:22:50.897
Yo, what's up, playas?
Yo, yo, yo, what's up? How y'all doin'?

01:22:50.981 --> 01:22:55.443
- Skinny, what are you doin' here?
- The same thing you doin' here.

01:22:55.485 --> 01:22:58.571
- Let's go. Out the door. No.
- What are you talkin' about?

01:22:58.613 --> 01:23:00.699
Hey, move, man, move.

01:23:00.782 --> 01:23:03.410
Let me be here, man.
What's wrong with you?

01:23:03.493 --> 01:23:05.787
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on, man.

01:23:05.870 --> 01:23:09.916
Here. Matter of fact, here.
Here's some bus money. Go home.

01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.961
Why I gotta leave?
What you talkin' about?

01:23:13.003 --> 01:23:15.880
- Your mom'll kill us if she finds you here.
- Go home.

01:23:15.964 --> 01:23:18.466
Man, let me in.

01:23:19.384 --> 01:23:20.593
Shh...

01:23:20.635 --> 01:23:23.138
Man, I'm lookin' all sexy for no reason.

01:23:23.221 --> 01:23:26.308
What y'all laughin' at, man?

01:23:26.391 --> 01:23:29.311
- What up, Skinny?
- Don't touch me.

01:23:30.312 --> 01:23:33.648
- I'll be back. Watch the car.
- Be right here, PJ.

01:23:42.699 --> 01:23:45.285
Kick me out the party.

01:23:54.711 --> 01:23:57.130
Hey, yo, get me a 40.

01:23:57.172 --> 01:24:00.300
- What you got in the bag?
- My music, you know.

01:24:02.052 --> 01:24:03.887
Do somethin', then.

01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:06.348
- You want me to show 'em somethin'?
- Put it down.

01:24:06.389 --> 01:24:09.351
It's nothin', it's nothin'.

01:24:10.018 --> 01:24:13.647
- DJ, can I get up on your table real quick?
- Yeah, you cool.

01:24:13.688 --> 01:24:14.731
Watch this.

01:24:29.537 --> 01:24:31.831
You're supposed to be
watching the car.

01:24:37.379 --> 01:24:39.005
Told you to watch the car, man.

01:24:41.216 --> 01:24:43.134
Come get me.

01:24:47.055 --> 01:24:51.017
# Take the swing, here's your chance
You got nothin' to lose, make your stand

01:24:51.101 --> 01:24:53.561
# The clock is tickin'
and time ain't waitin'

01:24:53.645 --> 01:24:56.398
# When ya all alone,
that's what you're facin'...

01:25:25.885 --> 01:25:28.054
- You see what your brother's doing?
- Who?

01:25:28.138 --> 01:25:30.098
Your little brother, man. Come on.

01:25:30.181 --> 01:25:32.934
That boy don't listen, man.

01:25:36.271 --> 01:25:37.772
What's he doin'?

01:25:37.856 --> 01:25:40.567
Yo, Mac, Ty,
bring some girls out here.

01:25:40.650 --> 01:25:41.860
That's PJ's truck.

01:25:41.943 --> 01:25:45.447
- Skinny, get out of that truck.
- Man, why?

01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:47.866
- I said get out.
- Let's go get him.

01:25:48.533 --> 01:25:49.701
Man...

01:25:59.461 --> 01:26:00.462
Skinny.

01:26:06.468 --> 01:26:08.887
Oh, no, no, no, man.

01:26:09.638 --> 01:26:11.598
Yo, Skinny, Skinny.

01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:14.726
Say something, say something.
Talk. Talk to me.

01:26:14.809 --> 01:26:16.770
Yo, call somebody, man!
Do somethin'.

01:26:16.811 --> 01:26:18.897
Call 911!

01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:21.650
Get up, get up.
Get up, man, get up!

01:27:48.153 --> 01:27:49.529
Hey.

01:27:50.405 --> 01:27:52.407
Hey.

01:27:55.368 --> 01:27:58.038
How long you been out here?

01:27:59.247 --> 01:28:00.540
I don't know.

01:28:02.792 --> 01:28:04.085
How's your mom?

01:28:07.339 --> 01:28:09.883
She spoke to me
for the first time today.

01:28:14.929 --> 01:28:19.643
- You know they got PJ, right?
- That's not gonna bring Skinny back.

01:28:24.230 --> 01:28:27.192
- This ain't your fault.
- That don't bring him back either.

01:28:27.275 --> 01:28:29.486
I hate seeing you beat yourself up.

01:28:29.569 --> 01:28:34.616
I'm beating myself up? We been
beating ourselves up way before Skinny...

01:28:41.122 --> 01:28:43.458
Skinny's dead.

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.377
He's gone.

01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:47.754
My little brother's gone.

01:28:49.005 --> 01:28:50.966
And that's on me, Ty.

01:28:51.049 --> 01:28:53.760
I know that.

01:28:53.802 --> 01:28:55.762
I ain't stupid.

01:28:55.804 --> 01:28:59.224
All the partying,
stealing cars, messin' around.

01:28:59.307 --> 01:29:01.434
You don't think I know
it's a bunch of bull?

01:29:01.476 --> 01:29:04.562
- We're doing the best we can.
- You really believe that?

01:29:04.646 --> 01:29:07.482
You really think this is the best we can be?

01:29:09.150 --> 01:29:10.443
No.

01:29:12.237 --> 01:29:14.364
I wanna be better.

01:29:15.407 --> 01:29:16.616
I wanna do better.

01:29:20.161 --> 01:29:21.913
You're right.

01:29:21.997 --> 01:29:26.626
We gotta do it for my moms, for Skinny.

01:29:32.173 --> 01:29:34.551
For Skinny.

01:29:51.610 --> 01:29:54.696
Can you do me a favor?

01:29:54.779 --> 01:29:56.698
Yeah.

01:29:56.740 --> 01:29:59.618
Will you come somewhere with me?

01:30:06.708 --> 01:30:08.668
Have a good show tonight.

01:30:10.545 --> 01:30:13.173
Hey, Miles. Hey.

01:30:13.256 --> 01:30:14.841
What's up?

01:30:14.924 --> 01:30:18.178
- Have you heard from Tyler at all?
- Nah, nah.

01:30:18.261 --> 01:30:20.013
How's Nora?

01:30:20.055 --> 01:30:23.350
- She's good.
- That's cool.

01:30:23.391 --> 01:30:24.893
That's cool.

01:30:30.106 --> 01:30:34.069
- What was that all about?
- Thanks, I guess, for...

01:30:34.110 --> 01:30:36.029
Hey, guys.

01:30:36.071 --> 01:30:37.197
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.866
- Miles, you ready?
- Oh, yeah, you know it.

01:30:39.950 --> 01:30:42.077
Great. See ya there.

01:30:45.956 --> 01:30:49.376
Luce, have a good show tonight.

01:30:49.417 --> 01:30:50.961
You too.

01:31:13.108 --> 01:31:17.112
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to this very special evening.

01:31:17.195 --> 01:31:21.408
The senior showcase is a highlight of our
year at the Maryland School of the Arts.

01:31:22.200 --> 01:31:24.244
Ten minutes, everyone.

01:31:26.955 --> 01:31:29.541
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:31:29.624 --> 01:31:31.668
Gimme some. Come on.

01:31:39.092 --> 01:31:41.594
- Hey, yo, thanks, man.
- Will you go?

01:32:03.950 --> 01:32:04.951
Nora.

01:32:05.035 --> 01:32:07.996
- What are you doing here?
- Before you say anything...

01:32:08.079 --> 01:32:09.289
Shh!

01:32:09.331 --> 01:32:12.500
I don't know where to start. I just...

01:32:12.584 --> 01:32:15.920
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
walked out on you like that.

01:32:16.004 --> 01:32:19.132
- Tyler, this is not the time.
- Please let me get this out.

01:32:20.258 --> 01:32:23.845
I've made every wrong decision
I could possibly have made.

01:32:23.929 --> 01:32:26.056
I'm doing this without a partner.

01:32:26.139 --> 01:32:29.434
That's enough.
Nora, check your dancers.

01:32:29.517 --> 01:32:33.313
Tyler, I don't think
you realize how important this is.

01:32:33.396 --> 01:32:36.983
I do realize how important this is.
That's exactly why I'm here.

01:32:37.025 --> 01:32:40.195
You said if I want something,
I gotta fight for it. Right?

01:32:40.278 --> 01:32:44.491
That's what I'm doing. I'm fighting for
something real for the first time in my life.

01:32:44.532 --> 01:32:48.161
I can't do this right now.
This is everything I've worked for.

01:32:48.203 --> 01:32:52.832
I know and I'm sorry. I wanted you
to do this the way you imagined it.

01:32:54.501 --> 01:32:55.752
That's it.

01:32:57.879 --> 01:33:00.090
I can't.

01:33:00.173 --> 01:33:01.591
It's too late.

01:33:06.304 --> 01:33:09.015
OK.

01:33:09.057 --> 01:33:10.392
Um...

01:33:10.475 --> 01:33:12.519
Good luck.

01:33:18.316 --> 01:33:20.944
Tyler.

01:33:26.241 --> 01:33:28.368
Do you remember the steps?

01:33:28.410 --> 01:33:32.038
Couldn't forget 'em
even if I wanted to.

01:33:34.582 --> 01:33:38.378
OK, everyone, we're back
to the old dance with Tyler.

01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:41.673
Yeah!

01:33:41.756 --> 01:33:44.134
OK, let's go.

01:33:46.219 --> 01:33:48.555
This is the girl
I was telling you about.

01:33:48.597 --> 01:33:50.599
OK.

01:33:56.062 --> 01:33:57.814
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

01:34:35.268 --> 01:34:36.227
# Ah

01:34:36.311 --> 01:34:38.313
# I see you, give it to me

01:34:38.396 --> 01:34:40.815
# Stop playin', ah

01:34:40.899 --> 01:34:43.151
# I see you, give it to me

01:34:43.234 --> 01:34:44.653
# Stop playin'

# Let's get it goin', unh

01:36:08.612 --> 01:36:10.280
# Whoo, yeah

# Let's get it goin' now

01:36:12.115 --> 01:36:13.325
# Unh

01:36:13.408 --> 01:36:15.035
# Yeah, unh

01:36:15.118 --> 01:36:16.786
# A little louder now

01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:19.998
# Come on, yeah, unh

01:36:20.081 --> 01:36:21.708
# Let's get it poppin' now

01:36:21.791 --> 01:36:24.127
# Yeah, come on

01:36:24.210 --> 01:36:25.420
# Unh, unh

01:36:25.503 --> 01:36:26.546
# Let's go

01:36:26.630 --> 01:36:28.882
# I see you, give it to me

01:36:28.923 --> 01:36:31.593
# Stop playin', ah

01:36:31.676 --> 01:36:33.386
# I see you, give it to me

01:36:33.470 --> 01:36:36.431
# Stop playin', ah

01:36:36.473 --> 01:36:38.433
# I see you, give it to me

01:36:38.516 --> 01:36:41.227
# Stop playin', ah

01:36:41.269 --> 01:36:43.355
# I see you, give it to me

01:36:43.438 --> 01:36:45.982
# Stop playin', ah

01:36:46.066 --> 01:36:48.360
# I see you, give it to me

01:36:48.443 --> 01:36:50.236
# Stop playin', ah

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:52.906
# I see you, give it to me

01:36:52.989 --> 01:36:54.866
# Stop playin', ah

01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:57.619
# I see you, give it to me

01:36:57.702 --> 01:37:00.622
# Stop playin', ah

01:37:00.705 --> 01:37:02.457
# I see you, give it to me

01:37:02.540 --> 01:37:05.210
# Stop playin', ah

01:37:05.293 --> 01:37:07.754
# I see you, give it to me

01:37:20.850 --> 01:37:22.435
Bravo!

01:37:24.229 --> 01:37:26.273
You were so good.

01:37:29.818 --> 01:37:31.486
That's right.

01:37:52.173 --> 01:37:55.051
Hey, that was good stuff
out there. Worked it.

01:37:55.135 --> 01:37:57.137
That was all pretty good.

01:37:57.220 --> 01:37:58.597
You seen me dance before.

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:02.183
But not like that. I ain't
never seen you do nothing like that.

01:38:02.267 --> 01:38:04.811
- That was her right there.
- That's her?

01:38:04.894 --> 01:38:07.772
And over here,
this is Nora Clark.

01:38:07.856 --> 01:38:11.276
- Wow, you were wonderful.
- Thank you so much.

01:38:11.359 --> 01:38:16.656
I'd like to discuss with you the possibility
of joining our company after graduation.

01:38:16.698 --> 01:38:18.617
- I would love that.
- Yeah, me too.

01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:21.161
She's everything you said she'd be.

01:38:21.244 --> 01:38:24.706
Who's the male lead?

01:38:24.748 --> 01:38:27.709
This is Tyler Gage.

01:38:27.751 --> 01:38:30.003
He's a transfer.

01:38:30.086 --> 01:38:31.212
Oh, my God.

01:38:31.296 --> 01:38:32.297
Wait, a what?

01:38:32.380 --> 01:38:35.550
- Don't forget to send me your transcripts.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:38:35.634 --> 01:38:38.053
- Very well done.
- We'll see you Monday.

01:38:40.221 --> 01:38:42.432
We'll see you on Monday.

01:38:42.515 --> 01:38:44.392
- Congrats, man.
- Appreciate it.

01:38:44.476 --> 01:38:47.187
Let you do your thing.
I'll meet you at the car.

01:38:48.897 --> 01:38:52.776
- You know what that means, right?
- No. What's that mean?

01:38:52.859 --> 01:38:56.529
- You're gonna have to get some tights.
- Done.

01:39:23.181 --> 01:39:25.892
# He said,
"Hi, my name is so and so

01:39:25.976 --> 01:39:27.852
# "Baby, can you tell me yours?

01:39:27.936 --> 01:39:30.397
# "You look like
you came to do one thing"

01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:33.024
- # Set it off
- # I started on the left

01:39:33.108 --> 01:39:35.151
# And I had to take him to the right

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:36.695
# He was out of breath

01:39:36.778 --> 01:39:38.989
# But he kept on dancin' all night

01:39:39.072 --> 01:39:40.532
# You tryin', admit it

01:39:40.615 --> 01:39:43.243
# But you just can't fight the feelin' inside

01:39:43.285 --> 01:39:44.494
# You know it

01:39:44.577 --> 01:39:47.038
# And I can see it in your eyes

01:39:47.122 --> 01:39:48.206
# You want me

01:39:48.290 --> 01:39:49.916
# You smooth as a mother

01:39:49.958 --> 01:39:51.876
# You're so undercover

01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.837
# By the way that you was watchin' me

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:55.714
# Ooh, uh

01:39:55.797 --> 01:39:59.342
# The way you look at me.
I'm feelin' you, uh

01:39:59.426 --> 01:40:02.929
# I just can't help it,
tryin' to keep it cool, uh

01:40:03.013 --> 01:40:04.764
# I can feel it in the beat, uh

01:40:04.806 --> 01:40:06.641
# When you do those things to me, uh

01:40:06.725 --> 01:40:08.560
# Don't let nothin' stop you

01:40:08.643 --> 01:40:11.605
# Move

01:40:11.688 --> 01:40:12.731
# Ring the alarm

01:40:12.814 --> 01:40:15.817
# The club is jumpin' now, so get up

01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:18.236
# I said, "Ciara's on your radio

01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:19.946
# "Everybody turn it up"

01:40:19.988 --> 01:40:21.948
# Spicy just like hot sauce

01:40:21.990 --> 01:40:23.783
# Careful, you might burn it up

01:40:23.825 --> 01:40:27.537
# You can do the pop-lock,
ragtop, don't stop

01:40:27.621 --> 01:40:30.999
# That's the way you gotta get
Get it, make ya body rock

01:40:31.082 --> 01:40:33.001
# You tryin', admit it

01:40:33.043 --> 01:40:35.545
# But you just can't beat
the feelin' inside

01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:39.132
# You know it
'cause I can see it in your eyes

01:40:39.215 --> 01:40:42.177
# You want me,
you smooth as a mother

01:40:42.260 --> 01:40:44.012
# You're so undercover

# Don't let nothin' stop you

# Move

01:41:03.782 --> 01:41:05.200
# Ring the alarm

# The club is jumpin' now, so get up

01:41:08.703 --> 01:41:13.166
# Ooh, I love the way you vibe with me

01:41:13.208 --> 01:41:15.835
# Dance with me forever

01:41:15.919 --> 01:41:18.880
# We can have a good time

01:41:18.922 --> 01:41:20.674
# Follow me

01:41:20.715 --> 01:41:23.510
# To the beat together

01:41:23.593 --> 01:41:27.097
# You and me, one on one

01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:29.975
# Breakin' it down

01:41:30.058 --> 01:41:33.478
# You can't walk away now

01:41:33.561 --> 01:41:37.857
# We got to turn this place out, oh

01:41:37.941 --> 01:41:42.195
# It's the kids, ridin' big
The police tried to catch ridin' dirty

01:41:42.279 --> 01:41:45.907
# In the club before eleven o'clock
Like I'm tryin' to catch it down kinda early

01:41:45.991 --> 01:41:49.411
# Her hair, brown and curly
She love the way my ride shinin' pearly

01:41:49.494 --> 01:41:53.123
