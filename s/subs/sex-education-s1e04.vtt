Like, he's not a slacker.

27:16.605 --> 27:18.525
No, he's probably gonna be president
or something.

27:24.045 --> 27:24.965

27:39.925 --> 27:41.165
What’s so good about it?

27:44.325 --> 27:46.125
You always have someone to hang out with.

27:46.205 --> 27:49.845
And, like, last week, I got chased
by a fox, and Kyle threw a shoe at it.

27:51.165 --> 27:52.685
It was so romantic.

28:04.605 --> 28:07.605
This is good. It's really helpful,
being in the water, isn't it?

28:07.685 --> 28:11.565
It's freeing us up. We're really figuring
out how our bodies can intertwine.

28:11.645 --> 28:14.205

Is it working for you?

28:14.965 --> 28:15.925

[Ruthie] What are you doing?

28:24.565 --> 28:26.565

I engineered this situation

28:26.645 --> 28:27.885
for my own sexual gratification.

28:27.965 --> 28:29.325
That would be super creepy.

28:29.925 --> 28:31.085
Hence the backwards stance.

28:31.605 --> 28:34.045
This is even creepier.
Just turn around. Stop being creepy.

28:36.245 --> 28:40.645
Well, like I said before, I am
a sex and relationship therapist.

28:40.725 --> 28:43.245
You are a teenager with
an inflated sense of self-importance.

28:43.325 --> 28:44.645
Right. Well, I have a hunch

28:44.725 --> 28:48.165
that this is more to do with your
relationship than your physical intimacy.

28:48.605 --> 28:50.525
-How's your communication?
-We've known each other

28:50.605 --> 28:52.965
since primary school,
and we talk for hours.

28:53.445 --> 28:55.445
-It might help.
-Interesting.

28:55.805 --> 28:57.365
How long have you guys been together?

28:57.445 --> 28:58.445
About four months.

28:58.525 --> 29:01.605
We both came out around the same time
and it just happened.

29:01.685 --> 29:02.525
Interesting.

29:02.605 --> 29:04.365
I'm sure you find
lots of things interesting,

29:04.445 --> 29:06.645
but our problem is with the sex,
not the relationship.

29:06.725 --> 29:08.645
So we're just gonna
figure this out on our own.

29:09.565 --> 29:10.965
