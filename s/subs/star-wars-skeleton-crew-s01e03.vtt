[pants] <i>They just took off in a starship.</i>

00:08.708 --> 00:10.124
You gotta bring 'em back.

00:10.125 --> 00:12.790
Of course. Come with us, sir.

00:12.791 --> 00:17.624
- [SM-33] Where is it that you call home?
- It's At Attin. Where we just were.

00:17.625 --> 00:20.165
C-Can't say I remember no At Attin.

00:20.166 --> 00:22.124
Wim, you promised
we wouldn't get in trouble,

00:22.125 --> 00:26.000
but now we're way, way out
past the Barrier that we're lost forever.

00:28.375 --> 00:29.666
[man retching]

00:30.833 --> 00:31.957
- [all laughing]
- [Neel] Ew.

00:31.958 --> 00:33.583
We need directions home, that's all.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.249
- Is this enough, sir?
- Whoa! See if they got more on 'em.

00:38.250 --> 00:40.875
- [both exclaim]
- Help! Help!

00:43.916 --> 00:44.915
- [groaning]
- [sizzling]

00:44.916 --> 00:47.707
Why did you bring us to a pirate port
full of pirates?

00:47.708 --> 00:50.125
- [electronic whining, crackling]
- No. 33!

00:50.958 --> 00:54.458
- Cool off in the brig a day or two.
- What's a brig?

00:55.958 --> 00:59.332
I guess the legend is that At Attin
holds some sort of eternal treasure.

00:59.333 --> 01:00.833
[man] Fear not.

01:01.708 --> 01:04.875
I can help you get to your ship.

01:06.666 --> 01:07.666
[softly] You're a Jedi.

02:11.333 --> 02:13.457
[in normal voice] Oh,
you must be exhausted.

02:13.458 --> 02:14.665
It'll be fine.

02:14.666 --> 02:16.791
Safety Droids will find the kids.

02:17.750 --> 02:19.249
They'll report in soon. [sighs]

02:19.250 --> 02:21.624
We keep goin' in circles.

02:21.625 --> 02:25.999
[voice breaking] What worries me is that
we lost the signal to KB's life monitor.

02:26.000 --> 02:28.457
When I was a girl,
and my friends and I would run away,

02:28.458 --> 02:30.833
the Safety Droids always
found us eventually.

02:31.833 --> 02:33.750
- [Safety Droid trills]
- Oh, finally.

02:34.833 --> 02:38.208
Greetings. I have been sent
by the Supervisor.

02:38.958 --> 02:39.957
Here we go.

02:39.958 --> 02:43.790
Your children are on a starship
that has illegally exited the Barrier.

02:43.791 --> 02:44.999
[Nooma] What?

02:45.000 --> 02:47.415
Is the Supervisor going to contact
the Republic for help?

02:47.416 --> 02:49.707
Because the starship
is outside the Barrier,

02:49.708 --> 02:53.124
the Supervisor is unable
to risk any contact.

02:53.125 --> 02:54.790
Damn the risk, these are our kids!

02:54.791 --> 02:56.457
Our daughter has
very urgent medical needs!

02:56.458 --> 02:59.124
I'm submitting a petition for
an immediate audience with the Supervisor.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.499
- Everybody, please remain calm.
- You have to tell the Supervisor.

03:01.500 --> 03:02.665
[parents arguing indistinctly]

03:02.666 --> 03:05.082
[Safety Droid] Contact outside
the Barrier is forbidden.

03:05.083 --> 03:05.583
[Fara] This is not how things should happen.

03:05.708 --> 03:08.332
Travel outside
the Barrier is forbidden.

03:08.333 --> 03:09.415
Any violation

03:09.416 --> 03:13.250
of planetwide protocols
will result in security action.

04:04.416 --> 04:05.499
Let's get to your ship.

04:05.500 --> 04:07.457
[in normal voice]
We never agreed to give you a ride.

04:07.458 --> 04:09.207
- Wha-- He's helping us.
- [Neel] Yeah.

04:09.208 --> 04:12.791
I-If you could escape at any time,
what did you need our help for?

04:14.291 --> 04:17.208
Without a ship,
what use was freeing myself from the cell?

04:19.750 --> 04:22.874
- I waited, the Force provided.
- [electronic beeping]

04:22.875 --> 04:26.250
There's no treasure on our planet,
if that's what you're after.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.416
- That's not what I'm after.
- Yeah, 'cause he's a Jedi.

04:32.416 --> 04:33.832
We have no idea who he is.

04:33.833 --> 04:36.040
[Wim] Yes, we do. He's a Jedi!

04:36.041 --> 04:39.582
My name is Jod Na Nawood. And you are?

04:39.583 --> 04:41.041
- Neel.
- I'm Wim.

04:43.083 --> 04:44.375
Now we know each other.

04:45.125 --> 04:46.125

04:55.875 --> 04:58.665
He could sense that someone
was gonna come around the corner.

04:58.666 --> 05:00.541
You know much of the Force.

05:01.708 --> 05:02.708
Hold.

05:06.083 --> 05:07.166
[whispers] Wait here.

05:11.541 --> 05:13.250
[Fern] 33 said to trust no one.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.749
This guy was in jail.

05:15.750 --> 05:18.624
- [Wim] So were we.
- Yeah, and he's got magic powers.

05:18.625 --> 05:20.165
So that means we can trust him?

05:20.166 --> 05:23.874
Jedis are the defenders of justice
and keepers of peace in the galaxy.

05:23.875 --> 05:25.207
Everybody knows that.

[object clangs]

05:31.916 --> 05:34.791
Now then, which direction?

05:36.666 --> 05:38.583
There are many living beings this way.

05:39.083 --> 05:40.124
And that way is empty.

05:40.125 --> 05:41.582
Great. Let's go the empty way.

05:41.583 --> 05:45.415
Mmm... Easier to hide in a crowd
than an empty corridor.

05:45.416 --> 05:47.458
- If one wants to--
- Wait. Hold.

05:57.208 --> 05:59.250
So I guess KB's got the Force too.

06:02.625 --> 06:04.500
The Force flows through us all.

That was too easy.

06:57.416 --> 06:58.500
You're welcome.

06:59.875 --> 07:04.624
Now then, which of these ships is yours?

07:04.625 --> 07:05.749
[Wim] Uh, well...

07:05.750 --> 07:09.707
Okay, I think you should know
that our ship, it-- it's--

07:09.708 --> 07:12.957
He's trying to tell you it's a wreck,
but he's too embarrassed.

07:12.958 --> 07:14.540
Technically, it shouldn't fly.

07:14.541 --> 07:16.124
It smells funny.

07:16.125 --> 07:18.583
Well, can't smell as bad as--

07:21.875 --> 07:22.875
Wait.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.458
Not that?

07:30.583 --> 07:32.165
Ready to kiss this rock goodbye?

07:32.166 --> 07:33.915

07:33.916 --> 07:37.958
Oh, I have an old friend in mind.

07:40.375 --> 07:42.165
- [clatters]
- She's an expert on star maps,

07:42.166 --> 07:43.915
lost planets, that kind of thing.

07:43.916 --> 07:44.999
She'll find your home.

07:45.000 --> 07:47.540
- What about SM-33?
- What about what?

07:47.541 --> 07:50.499
Our droid. He knows how to operate
and repair the ship.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.249
- [starship powering up]
- We'll be fine without him.

07:53.250 --> 07:54.540
He saved us.

07:54.541 --> 07:55.665
Yeah, we need him.

07:55.666 --> 07:57.249
We're not going back for a droid.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.249
I thought the Jedi
never left a man behind.

07:59.250 --> 08:00.416
That's not--

08:01.166 --> 08:04.457
- [computer beeping]
- First, it's a droid.

08:04.458 --> 08:09.249
Second, that's not a Jedi thing
the Jedi say.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.957
If you don't go, I will.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.374
- And me!
- And me. [sighs]

08:12.375 --> 08:13.457
We'll go together.

08:13.458 --> 08:16.040
You try that, you'll be recaptured
and back in the brig

08:16.041 --> 08:17.582
before you can say "parsec."

08:17.583 --> 08:19.208
But you can do it, right?

08:19.791 --> 08:20.999
You can do anything.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.416
Yeah, you're a Jedi, right?

08:25.750 --> 08:26.750
'Course.

08:28.666 --> 08:29.666
I'll do it.

08:32.458 --> 08:33.583
You stay here.

08:34.583 --> 08:35.958
Where it's safe.

08:39.791 --> 08:40.791
Thank you.

08:41.291 --> 08:43.624
S-37-what?

08:43.625 --> 08:46.499
SM-33. He was disabled
right before we were captured.

08:46.500 --> 08:49.332
Oh, and don't forget about the rat
that lives in his eye hole.

08:49.333 --> 08:50.791
Wait, don't touch anything!

08:51.833 --> 08:54.291
You don't wanna blast off accidentally
before I get back.

08:57.750 --> 09:00.624
- We should blast off before he gets back.
- What?

09:00.625 --> 09:02.540
[Beef] Silvo has escaped from the brig!

09:02.541 --> 09:04.707

You're the best skipper I ever had.

10:57.666 --> 11:02.707
Now, why is it he decided to let you loose
right before your trial?

11:02.708 --> 11:04.250
I let myself loose.

about those?

Hyperdrive.

14:09.208 --> 14:10.666
- Take it! Wim!
- [Wim grunts]

14:13.125 --> 14:15.374
Wait. But isn't it dangerous
to go to hyperspace

14:15.375 --> 14:16.875
if we're tied to something?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.749
Do you want me to go after 'em, Captain?

14:36.750 --> 14:38.415
[growls] Put a bounty on his head.

14:38.416 --> 14:41.707
I want him groveling at my feet.

14:41.708 --> 14:42.791
And those pups.

14:43.791 --> 14:45.208
Is he dead?

14:45.833 --> 14:47.916
- [squeaks]
- No, he's just turned off.

14:49.125 --> 14:51.500
- Here.

He's good. He's on our side.

14:57.875 --> 14:59.874
He saved us. And you.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.333
Yeah, he's a Jedi.

15:01.958 --> 15:03.957
- Jedi?
- Yeah.

15:03.958 --> 15:05.415
You can trust him.

15:05.416 --> 15:07.999
He's taking us to his friend
who can help us find At Attin.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.874
C-Can't say I remember no At Attin.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.083
[Fern] Yeah, we know.

15:19.541 --> 15:22.541
So... At Attin.

- [Wim] It's okay.
- [KB] I want food.

15:48.833 --> 15:50.957
- [Wim] There's enough for everyone.
- [Neel] I'm starving.

15:50.958 --> 15:53.125

Neel, don't put your trunk in there.

Found something.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.457
Are these kids really from At Attin?

17:18.458 --> 17:21.499
I'll tell you what I know,
and mark my words,

17:21.500 --> 17:24.583
for I won't be

17:25.500 --> 17:28.458
They're definitely from somewhere.

17:29.041 --> 17:30.041
Aye.

17:43.375 --> 17:44.583
Aye.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.166
- [Neel] Here you go, little guy.

You really think
there is treasure back home?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.832
[scoffs] On At Attin? Yeah, right.

18:00.833 --> 18:03.750
Maybe the treasure has to do
with the Great Work.

18:05.041 --> 18:06.040
What do you mean?

18:06.041 --> 18:08.749
Well, like, what does your mom do?

18:08.750 --> 18:10.040
She works in admin.

18:10.041 --> 18:12.832
- Mine are analysts.
- Yeah, mine, too.

18:12.833 --> 18:14.207
So what?

18:14.208 --> 18:15.874
So what do they analyze?

18:15.875 --> 18:17.750
[scoffs] Something boring...

About money.

Food was good.

18:31.833 --> 18:33.000
Okay.

18:34.416 --> 18:35.666
Time to get some sleep.

But I'm not even tired.

You do sleep, don't you?

It's unlikely you're telling the truth
about being a Jedi.

19:13.541 --> 19:14.708
You don't trust me.

19:16.833 --> 19:18.458
I calculated the odds.

19:21.416 --> 19:24.041
Not everything in the galaxy
can be calculated.

we go way back, but...

I don't trust her.

Not 100%.

In that...

she might stab us in the back.

Stab us?

Not literally.

from 1,000 different worlds.

There's more than that, my girl.

Should we get down to business?

Quiet, Jack.

Children, what in the depths
are you doing with him?

23:40.916 --> 23:42.540
Oh, this will never do.

23:42.541 --> 23:45.582
- He rescued us.
- He said you could show us the way home.

23:45.583 --> 23:49.833
I got maps of every star in the galaxy
and hyperspace routes between them all.

23:50.666 --> 23:52.165
Where are you from, children?

23:52.166 --> 23:54.124
- Let me explain--
- At Attin.

23:54.125 --> 23:56.165
You've heard of it, right?

23:56.166 --> 23:59.166
At Attin? At Attin?

24:00.375 --> 24:04.457
- [squawks]
- [grunts] Wait, Kh'ymm. It's true.

24:04.458 --> 24:06.665
They're from At Attin.

At Attin is very interesting... [grunts]
...as an astrogation problem. [grunts]

- [Kh'ymm] No, my dear boy.

You see, your home has been purposely
hidden from the rest of the galaxy.

24:22.958 --> 24:25.665
There is no map to At Attin.

24:25.666 --> 24:30.374
No, this scroll depicts
the Jewels of the Old Republic.

24:30.375 --> 24:34.374
Planets of wonders kept hidden
for their protection.

24:34.375 --> 24:38.375
Long ago, they were all destroyed,
except for one.

24:38.958 --> 24:40.665
At Attin.

24:40.666 --> 24:44.249
Now only remembered in children's stories,

24:44.250 --> 24:48.416

and rumors believed by fools.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.915
But I've always believed.

We need a map.

24:53.875 --> 24:55.041
No, we don't.

in all the galaxy?

25:20.208 --> 25:22.665
Nothing. It's totally boring.

25:22.666 --> 25:24.249
Any nearby planets?

25:24.250 --> 25:26.415
In school, we learned
about Coruscant and Alderaan.

25:26.416 --> 25:29.165
Alderaan? [chuckling]
Missed the war, did you?

25:29.166 --> 25:30.416
What war?

25:30.833 --> 25:32.208
Fascinating.

25:33.166 --> 25:37.125
[Neel] Part of the Great Work is that
we're supposed to stay inside the Barrier.

25:37.958 --> 25:41.125
Great Work? Barrier?

25:41.625 --> 25:44.915
Tell me, what does this "Barrier"
look like?

25:44.916 --> 25:47.124
[stuttering] You see it at night.

25:47.125 --> 25:49.249
It's cloudy.

25:49.250 --> 25:52.333
- Like a swirl.
- A-ha!

25:53.125 --> 25:54.332
Nebular gasses.

25:54.333 --> 25:57.207
Perhaps that's why the planets
remained hidden.

25:57.208 --> 25:59.040
- Does this narrow it down?
- [Kh'ymm] Oh, yes.

25:59.041 --> 26:01.249
To only 10,000 worlds.

26:01.250 --> 26:02.707
Ten thousand?

We'll carry on until we've picked
your little brains clean. [squawks]

26:07.750 --> 26:09.415
This is never gonna work.

26:09.416 --> 26:13.415
But Fern, we've already eliminated 99.99%.

What, what? What's that symbol?

26:16.166 --> 26:18.040
[grunts] Here. On your rucksack.

26:18.041 --> 26:19.665
[Fern] It's 'cause I'm Head of the Class.

26:19.666 --> 26:21.540
- My mom makes me wear it.

26:21.541 --> 26:25.624
I've never seen Palmarish numerals
used in proto-Republic artifacts.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.582
[grunts] We'll cross-reference this
with the Jewels of the Old Republic,

26:28.583 --> 26:31.874
planets in nebulae,
our estimated orbital parameters.

26:31.875 --> 26:33.374
This may actually work.

26:33.375 --> 26:35.790
- You have it? Is that it?
- Yes. I...

26:35.791 --> 26:37.707
- Well, no.
- [computer beeping]

26:37.708 --> 26:39.082
No, actually.

So many parameters to run.

26:41.083 --> 26:43.499

it could take who knows how long?

26:43.500 --> 26:45.041
If I didn't know better...

26:47.166 --> 26:48.915
I'd say you were stalling.

Crimson Jack is a scoundrel.

But what are you going to do?
Go with Jack?

28:05.500 --> 28:08.165
He got us this far.
But I don't trust him. Not really.

28:08.166 --> 28:10.750
What did he tell you? "Trust your gut"?

28:11.666 --> 28:15.333
Use your head. Get the truth.

28:16.041 --> 28:20.749
And if you ever need help,
you can call me anytime.

28:20.750 --> 28:22.833
[♪ dramatic music playing]

28:27.833 --> 28:29.291
Come on! Head down!

28:34.041 --> 28:35.040
[all panting]

28:35.041 --> 28:36.750
- Come on!
- [Wim] Go, go, go, go, go!

28:37.166 --> 28:38.540
- Wait. No!
- Come on. On the ship.

28:38.541 --> 28:39.624
We're not going anywhere

28:39.625 --> 28:41.290
- until you tell us the truth.
- [Neel grunts]

28:41.291 --> 28:43.500
- The truth is, we have no time for this.
- [Wim] Neel!

28:44.291 --> 28:46.999
- Who are you?
- And why did Kh'ymm call you Crimson Jack?

28:47.000 --> 28:51.165
[grunts] Well, I'll tell you
the whole long story on the ship.

28:51.166 --> 28:52.375
[KB pants]

28:53.083 --> 28:54.707
33?

28:54.708 --> 28:58.000
Aye, Captain.
Is the Jedi giving you trouble?

28:58.958 --> 29:02.499
We are not going anywhere
until you tell us who you are.

29:02.500 --> 29:04.666
- Crimson Jack?
- [engine whirring]

29:06.750 --> 29:09.124
[Jod] Well, you're not going anywhere
without coordinates.

29:09.125 --> 29:10.499
- Hey!
- [KB, amplified] <i>Hey, X-wings!</i>

29:10.500 --> 29:12.582
<i>- Here we are! We're right over here!</i>
- Stop.

29:12.583 --> 29:15.249
You wanna know who I am? Yeah?
You wanna know? I'll tell you.

29:15.250 --> 29:16.750
I'll tell you who I am. Come on.

29:17.666 --> 29:19.040
On the ship.

29:19.041 --> 29:22.582
- Tell us now. The truth.
- The truth. The truth.

29:22.583 --> 29:23.749
- The truth.
- [Jod] The truth!

29:23.750 --> 29:26.290
[loudly] The truth is, I'm just like you!

29:26.291 --> 29:27.665
Okay?

29:27.666 --> 29:29.500
I'm lost. I'm alone.

29:30.458 --> 29:32.708
But you are a Jedi, right?

29:34.375 --> 29:35.957
[in normal voice]
I never actually said that.

29:35.958 --> 29:37.374
- What?
- [Fern] I knew it.

29:37.375 --> 29:38.999
[Neel] How do you make things float?

29:39.000 --> 29:42.457
Listen! Kh'ymm's goons are not gonna
help you get home.

29:42.458 --> 29:44.625
But you and me, we want the same thing.

29:45.583 --> 29:46.749
Let's make a deal.

29:46.750 --> 29:48.290
I'll get you home.

29:48.291 --> 29:51.082
I'll do the right thing.
Maybe, maybe get a little reward.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.749
We'll make a partnership. Hmm?

29:52.750 --> 29:54.250
Not partners.

29:54.750 --> 29:57.208
You work for us. Deal?

30:07.375 --> 30:08.375
Deal.

30:08.958 --> 30:09.999
[SM-33] We can't leave now.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.165
The launch support system's
half disassembled.

30:12.166 --> 30:14.500
[Jod] Re-assemble it! We're taking off!

30:16.583 --> 30:18.000
[powering up]

30:25.458 --> 30:26.999
- Okay, what now?
- Yeah, what now?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.874
- I'd get the hyperdrive ready.
- Right. Um, how do we do that?

30:29.875 --> 30:31.125
- I'll get 33.
- No!

30:31.833 --> 30:33.958
Rely on a droid, they'll let you down
every time.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.416
- Damn it!
- [Wim] The goons!

30:43.125 --> 30:45.249
[man on radio] <i>Crimson Jack,
land this ship immediately--</i>

30:45.250 --> 30:46.374
[radio turns off]

30:46.375 --> 30:49.749
We have to get to the other side
of this moon to make the jump.

30:49.750 --> 30:51.540
Other si-- We'll never make it that far!

30:51.541 --> 30:53.415
Once we see daylight, we're gone.

30:53.416 --> 30:56.374
Neel, I need you to take the controls
and evade their fire.

30:56.375 --> 30:59.999
- Neel? Neel?
- [stutters] I can't fly a ship.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.958
Like this, just wiggle the controls
a little. Evade. Evade.

31:04.958 --> 31:06.874
You. You. With me.

31:06.875 --> 31:09.874
- I'm the captain! You work for us!
- [Wim] Why is Neel even flying the ship?

31:09.875 --> 31:11.750
- Why can't I fly the ship?
- [Fern] You work for us!

31:16.166 --> 31:18.207
- Let me fly the ship!
- [Fern] I said I'm the captain!

31:18.208 --> 31:19.415
Why, why do we even trust you?

31:19.416 --> 31:20.749
- [alarm beeps]
- Back.

31:20.750 --> 31:21.957
Okay.

31:21.958 --> 31:23.040
Get in.

31:23.041 --> 31:24.249
Come on, Captain.

31:24.250 --> 31:28.958
Grab this. Turn this. Fire here.
Just keep 'em back. Let's go.

31:29.666 --> 31:30.666
[seat clicks]

31:31.250 --> 31:32.500
- [grunts]
- [alarm beeps]

31:35.291 --> 31:36.291
[chuckles]

31:46.500 --> 31:47.500
Whoa.

32:03.416 --> 32:05.708
- I got 'em.
- That was my shot!

32:09.625 --> 32:12.165
- [screams]
- KB?

32:12.166 --> 32:13.458
A little further.

32:14.458 --> 32:15.708
Hands off.

32:18.333 --> 32:20.625
- Let me know when we're ready to jump.
- Okay.

32:21.666 --> 32:23.207
[♪ dramatic music continues playing]

32:23.208 --> 32:24.791
[grunts]

32:27.500 --> 32:28.749
Almost there.

32:28.750 --> 32:30.124
I can't see anything!

32:30.125 --> 32:32.083
- No, I can't either.
- Almost there.

32:33.708 --> 32:34.708
We're clear.

32:51.708 --> 32:52.791
[man coughing]

32:54.083 --> 32:56.624
What are you doing? You let them get away.

32:56.625 --> 32:58.708
It's too risky with the kids inside.

32:59.458 --> 33:01.000
Any idea where they're headed?

33:02.500 --> 33:07.500
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
