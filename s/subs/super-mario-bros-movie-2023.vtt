13:33.850 --> 13:35.159
What? No.

- Just come on.

13:38.494 --> 13:41.528

the storm drains can handle!

13:42.564 --> 13:45.235

Whoa.

15:18.132 --> 15:21.067

been down here for years.

It's all gonna be okay!

16:53.159 --> 16:54.523
How is this gonna be okay?

16:54.523 --> 16:56.558
I'm telling you,
nothing can hurt us

17:42.903 --> 17:44.540

You'll die!

17:46.344 --> 17:49.105
Oh, I'm sorry.
That one's perfectly fine.

17:49.105 --> 17:50.645
That's a little mushroom man.

17:50.645 --> 17:52.482
A little mushroom man

17:52.482 --> 17:53.945
Pleased to meet you.

17:53.945 --> 17:55.848
I'm Toad.

17:55.848 --> 17:58.257
Uh, Mario.

18:00.492 --> 18:03.262
So this is, uh... this is...
this is not a dream?

18:03.262 --> 18:04.989
- That hurt, right?

18:04.989 --> 18:07.299
- Yes!
- Definitely not a dream.

18:07.299 --> 18:09.862
Then it's... this place is...

18:09.862 --> 18:12.832
The Mushroom Kingdom!

18:12.832 --> 18:14.438
Mushrooms? Really?

18:14.438 --> 18:17.309
Now, that is
a cruel twist of fate.

18:22.173 --> 18:23.975
Hello.

18:24.780 --> 18:26.483
Yeah, I'm actually looking
for somebody.

18:26.483 --> 18:27.979
Uh, my brother, in fact.

18:27.979 --> 18:31.015
He looks exactly like me
but tall and skinny and green.

18:31.015 --> 18:33.655
See, last time I saw him, he...
he was falling through a pipe.

18:33.655 --> 18:36.086
It was foggy, and...
and I believe there was lava.

18:37.329 --> 18:39.463
Uh, that is not good.

18:39.463 --> 18:41.597
Um, your brother

18:41.597 --> 18:44.127
has landed in the Dark Lands.

18:44.127 --> 18:45.304
They're under...

18:45.304 --> 18:47.240
Bowser's control.

18:47.240 --> 18:48.670
Bowser?

18:48.670 --> 18:52.641
He's the most evil,
wretched creature alive.

18:55.611 --> 18:57.415
I'm taking you
to see the princess.

18:57.415 --> 18:59.549
She can help you.

18:59.549 --> 19:01.144
She can do anything.

19:01.144 --> 19:03.146
Princess?

19:07.856 --> 19:09.328
Come on, Mario!

19:09.328 --> 19:11.429
Our big adventure begins now!

19:11.429 --> 19:13.057
Hang on, Luigi.

19:40.218 --> 19:43.494
Mario? Mario?

19:43.494 --> 19:45.331
Where are you?

19:45.331 --> 19:46.464
Huh?

20:23.833 --> 20:26.438
Oh.

20:26.438 --> 20:29.166
Yes!

20:29.166 --> 20:31.707
You just got a-Luigi'd.

21:48.555 --> 21:49.884
This way, Mario.

21:49.884 --> 21:52.887
The princess lives
right on that hill.

22:01.027 --> 22:02.864
Excuse me, everybody.
Coming through.

22:02.864 --> 22:04.800
Got a big adventure
happening right now.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.065
Just clear a path for us.

22:06.065 --> 22:07.671
- If I could just...
- Here you go.

22:07.671 --> 22:08.969
Excuse me.

22:08.969 --> 22:11.136
Excuse me, everybody!
Coming through!

22:11.136 --> 22:14.678
This guy's brother is
going to die imminently!

22:14.678 --> 22:16.240
Out of the way, please!

22:16.240 --> 22:17.780
Just trying to clear a path.
That's all I'm doing.

22:17.780 --> 22:19.144
He's gonna be fine.

22:19.144 --> 22:20.376
- Chanterelle.
- Morning.

22:20.376 --> 22:22.081
- Nice to see you, bud.

22:24.116 --> 22:25.491
Does this thing work?

22:25.491 --> 22:26.723
Yes, works great.

22:26.723 --> 22:28.890
You just have to blow into it.

22:29.728 --> 22:31.497
And up we go.

22:31.497 --> 22:33.323
Wait, up?

22:51.814 --> 22:55.785
Whoa. Okay, so these bricks
are just floating here? Uh...

22:55.785 --> 22:57.787
Just pop in this pipe,
and we're on our way.

22:57.787 --> 22:58.986
Oh.

22:58.986 --> 23:00.691
- It's the only way to fly, man.

23:02.792 --> 23:05.388
Oh, wow.
Love these pi...

23:11.638 --> 23:12.802
Whoo!

23:19.074 --> 23:20.073
Huh?

23:26.345 --> 23:28.246
Oh, come on.

23:32.382 --> 23:34.252
Here we are. Palace doors.

23:34.252 --> 23:36.089
Bing, bang, boom.

23:37.829 --> 23:39.631
Come on!

23:39.631 --> 23:41.061
Whoo!

23:41.061 --> 23:43.063
Whoa.

23:47.804 --> 23:51.577
Pretty impressive, am I right?

23:54.472 --> 23:56.582
Hold it right there, you two.

23:56.582 --> 23:59.343
Oh, hey.
I need to see the princess.

23:59.343 --> 24:00.916
It's an emergency.

24:02.821 --> 24:04.018
What princess?

24:04.018 --> 24:06.053
I never heard of any princess.

24:06.053 --> 24:07.219
Oh, wait, I did.

24:07.219 --> 24:09.452
Our princess, though,
is in another castle.

24:09.452 --> 24:10.794
Oh, yeah. That's right.

24:10.794 --> 24:12.796
You should try
another castle, maybe.

24:12.796 --> 24:14.963
She ain't in this one.

24:14.963 --> 24:15.997
Huh?

24:15.997 --> 24:17.537
Okay, so they're
messing with you,

24:17.537 --> 24:19.539
and I don't like it.

24:23.204 --> 24:25.270
What do you guys, um...
What do you want to eat?

24:25.270 --> 24:27.239
Anything...
anything your hearts desire.

24:27.239 --> 24:28.075
Go.

24:28.075 --> 24:30.715
I am ready to scramble it up.

24:38.217 --> 24:40.351
Hey! Intruder!

24:40.351 --> 24:41.660
- Stop him!

24:41.660 --> 24:43.255
- Intruder!

24:43.255 --> 24:45.092
- Stop him!
- Stop him!

24:45.092 --> 24:47.292
Now! Stop him!

25:01.715 --> 25:03.715
Council, your attention.

25:03.715 --> 25:05.750
Bowser has found the Super Star

25:05.750 --> 25:08.280
and is headed
toward our kingdom.

25:08.280 --> 25:11.591
Its power will make him invincible.

25:11.591 --> 25:13.593
We will be destroyed.

25:15.518 --> 25:17.960
Princess, what are we gonna do?

25:17.960 --> 25:21.062
I will not let him hurt you.

25:26.036 --> 25:29.169
We are going to stop Bowser.

25:29.169 --> 25:30.676
How? Look at us.

25:30.676 --> 25:32.238
We're adorable.

25:32.238 --> 25:36.440
I'm going to convince
the great Kong army to help us.

25:36.440 --> 25:39.146
Together, we'll annihilate
that monster.

25:39.146 --> 25:41.819
Their mad king
doesn't make alliances.

25:41.819 --> 25:44.349
The Kongs will never agree.

25:44.349 --> 25:46.054
I can convince him.

25:46.054 --> 25:48.925
I'll leave for the
Jungle Kingdom in the morning.

25:49.730 --> 25:53.666
Good luck, Princess,
for all our sakes.

26:02.105 --> 26:06.437
Princess!

26:10.718 --> 26:12.377
Princess. Hi...

26:14.852 --> 26:17.316
Wait. Release him.

26:19.155 --> 26:21.584
Whoa.

26:21.584 --> 26:23.729
Are you...

26:25.324 --> 26:26.622
He's a human!

26:26.622 --> 26:28.096
I mean, you are a human, right?

26:28.096 --> 26:29.966
It's just,
you're so small and...

26:29.966 --> 26:31.330
- Hey.
- Wait, wait, wait.

26:31.330 --> 26:33.233
Let-let's go back.
Where did you come from?

26:33.233 --> 26:35.708
Uh, me and my little brother Luigi,

26:35.708 --> 26:37.270
we-we fell down this pipe.

26:37.270 --> 26:40.240
And now he's lost s-somewhere
in the Dark Lands.

26:40.240 --> 26:43.815
Then it's only a matter of time
until he's captured by Bowser.

26:43.815 --> 26:45.751
But you're in luck.

26:45.751 --> 26:47.511
I'm on my way to stop him.

26:47.511 --> 26:48.787
Well, take me with you.

26:48.787 --> 26:51.856
This guy's a lunatic, a psycho.

26:51.856 --> 26:54.760
He will eat you for breakfast.

26:54.760 --> 26:56.223
He won't even notice it, probably,

26:56.223 --> 26:59.061
'cause you're very, very small.

26:59.061 --> 27:00.964
You know what?
Make fun of me all you want,

27:00.964 --> 27:03.131
but you are gonna help me
find my brother.

27:04.332 --> 27:06.002
Please?

27:07.302 --> 27:08.367
Well, okay.

27:08.367 --> 27:10.468
Let's see what you're made of.

27:11.537 --> 27:13.108
Is that a yes?

27:13.108 --> 27:16.177
No, that's a "let's see
what you're made of."

28:05.030 --> 28:07.899
If you can finish this,
you're coming with me.

28:07.899 --> 28:09.428
Watch and learn.

28:34.717 --> 28:36.290
Hi-yah!

28:52.638 --> 28:54.308
That was amazing.

28:54.308 --> 28:56.915
Wait. How-how am I
supposed to do that?

28:56.915 --> 28:58.345
With the Power-Ups.

28:58.345 --> 29:01.084
They give us special abilities.

29:03.319 --> 29:05.055
Ugh. Really?

29:05.055 --> 29:06.925
Go on. Eat it.

29:11.723 --> 29:13.162
Now, this has to be a mushroom?

29:13.162 --> 29:15.659
'Cause I just hate
mushrooms and...

29:15.659 --> 29:17.100
Okay, okay.

29:18.398 --> 29:20.664
Are you sure
there's not, like, a...

29:20.664 --> 29:21.874
- Down the hatch.
-  Ow.

29:21.874 --> 29:23.634
Yep, there it is, and all gone.

29:25.042 --> 29:27.374
Oh, not cool.

29:27.374 --> 29:28.804
Uh...

29:30.850 --> 29:32.379
Huh?

29:41.588 --> 29:42.961
Whoa-oh-oh!

29:42.961 --> 29:45.260
- I'm tall.
- And strong.

29:47.825 --> 29:49.297
And you can jump.

29:49.297 --> 29:51.332
Oh, I got this.

29:51.332 --> 29:53.070
No problem.

29:54.733 --> 29:56.205
Woo-hoo!

30:04.081 --> 30:06.314
- Oh, yeah.

30:06.314 --> 30:09.614
When you get hit,
you lose the power.

30:11.123 --> 30:13.519
Great.

30:15.655 --> 30:17.424
Come on. Try again.

- But I didn't make it.
- You almost did.

31:37.108 --> 31:39.143
No one gets it right away.

31:39.143 --> 31:40.903
How many tries did it take you?

31:40.903 --> 31:43.345
Oh, so many.

31:43.345 --> 31:45.215
I was not good at it.

31:45.215 --> 31:46.942
Worse than you.

31:46.942 --> 31:48.449
You got it right away,
didn't you?

31:48.449 --> 31:50.715
I got it right away,
but I grew up here.

31:50.715 --> 31:53.520
Okay, now you're just trying
to make me feel better.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.127
No. No.

31:57.064 --> 32:00.032
- Is it working?
- A little bit. Yeah.

32:29.954 --> 32:31.360
My army!

32:31.360 --> 32:33.296
- Koopas.
- Yeah!

32:33.296 --> 32:34.726
- Goombas.

32:34.726 --> 32:36.860
- Whatever those things are.

32:36.860 --> 32:39.698
After years of searching
for the Super Star,

32:39.698 --> 32:42.206
- it is finally ours!
Yeah!

32:42.206 --> 32:45.704
I am now the most powerful
turtle in the world!

32:45.704 --> 32:47.145
Yeah!

32:47.145 --> 32:49.939
Soon, we will arrive
at the Mushroom Kingdom.

32:49.939 --> 32:51.248
Yeah!

32:51.248 --> 32:53.679
Where, after years
of being sworn enemies,

32:53.679 --> 32:56.187
I will ask their princess
to marry me

32:56.187 --> 32:58.222
in a fairy-tale wedding!

32:58.222 --> 32:59.817
Yeah!

32:59.817 --> 33:01.291
- Eh?

33:01.291 --> 33:03.194
Yeah.

33:03.194 --> 33:05.229
Did he say marry their princess?

33:05.229 --> 33:06.923
Doesn't she hate you?

33:06.923 --> 33:09.134
Of course she hates me.

33:09.134 --> 33:11.796
But that makes me love her
all the more.

33:11.796 --> 33:13.963
Her heart-shaped bangs,

33:13.963 --> 33:16.339
the way she floats
in the breeze,

33:16.339 --> 33:18.572
her immovable tiara.

33:18.572 --> 33:20.574
And when she sees this star...

33:20.574 --> 33:23.808
oh, wedding bells.

33:23.808 --> 33:26.349
Well, what if she says no?

33:28.353 --> 33:30.122
Then I will power up
with this star

33:30.122 --> 33:31.948
and destroy
the Mushroom Kingdom!

33:31.948 --> 33:33.389
Yeah!

33:33.389 --> 33:36.095
Prepare yourselves
for the best wedding ever.

33:36.095 --> 33:38.757
It's gonna rock!

34:48.334 --> 34:50.664
They're all counting on us.

34:50.664 --> 34:52.270
No pressure.

34:55.130 --> 34:57.209
Huh?

35:03.844 --> 35:08.418
My Toads, our days of terror
are almost over.

35:08.418 --> 35:11.520
With the help of the Kong army,
we will stop...

35:11.520 --> 35:14.358
Uh, who's he?

35:16.956 --> 35:19.264
He's not important!

35:35.711 --> 35:36.809
Nervous?

35:36.809 --> 35:38.316
Who? Me?

35:38.316 --> 35:40.109
- Yes, a little.

Well, that settles it.

36:05.475 --> 36:06.872

What?

37:40.900 --> 37:43.771
A report from our intelligence.

37:43.771 --> 37:47.808
A mustachioed human has arrived
in the Mushroom Kingdom.

37:49.348 --> 37:51.482
The princess has been
training him.

37:51.482 --> 37:53.913
They are up to something, sire.

37:56.313 --> 37:57.785
Sit.

37:58.887 --> 38:00.359
Jam with me.

38:03.694 --> 38:07.564
This, uh, human,
where did he come from?

38:07.564 --> 38:10.369
We... aren't sure.

38:10.369 --> 38:12.470
Does the princess like him?

38:12.470 --> 38:15.605
Oh, sire. Look in the mirror.

38:15.605 --> 38:17.970
You have nothing to worry about.

38:17.970 --> 38:21.006
I know that. I'm not threatened.

38:22.810 --> 38:27.111
Find out who he is
and what they're planning!

38:27.111 --> 38:29.619
I'm on it, sire.

38:29.619 --> 38:31.786
May I lift the cover?

38:31.786 --> 38:32.886
Not yet.

38:32.886 --> 38:35.427
- Pain is the best teacher.

38:45.769 --> 38:47.131
Thinking about your brother?

38:47.131 --> 38:49.738
We've never been apart
this long.

38:49.738 --> 38:52.675
Don't worry.
We're going to save him.

39:08.726 --> 39:11.430
You don't seem like
you're from here.

39:11.430 --> 39:14.191
I don't know where I'm from.

39:14.191 --> 39:15.225
Really?

39:15.225 --> 39:16.567
Yep.

39:16.567 --> 39:19.669
My earliest memory is arriving.

39:26.546 --> 39:28.645
<i>I was so lucky they found me.</i>

39:28.645 --> 39:30.581
<i>They took me in.</i>

39:32.308 --> 39:34.486
<i>Raised me like
one of their own.</i>

39:34.486 --> 39:36.521
<i>And when I was ready...</i>

39:38.490 --> 39:41.086
<i>...they made me their princess.</i>

39:45.565 --> 39:47.257
Hey, maybe you're from my world.

39:48.898 --> 39:51.734
There's a huge universe
out there

39:51.734 --> 39:54.605
with a lot of galaxies.

40:37.912 --> 40:40.552
We found him in the Dark Lands.

40:45.656 --> 40:47.284
Leave him to me.

40:56.766 --> 40:58.262
What is your name?

40:58.262 --> 41:00.495
Uh, Luigi.

41:01.804 --> 41:03.498
Not sure if you know who I am,

41:03.498 --> 41:07.139
but I'm about to marry
a princess and rule the world.

41:07.977 --> 41:09.504
Wow, uh...

41:09.504 --> 41:10.813
Yay.

41:10.813 --> 41:14.685
But there's one problem, Luigi.

41:14.685 --> 41:17.820
There's a human
traveling with my fiancée.

41:17.820 --> 41:20.823
Has a mustache, just like you.

41:20.823 --> 41:22.726
Do you know him?

41:22.726 --> 41:24.761
No. No.

41:24.761 --> 41:27.027
Ah, a tough one, I see.

41:27.027 --> 41:28.633
Maybe this will get you
to talk.

41:29.667 --> 41:30.833
Do you think I know

41:30.833 --> 41:31.933
every human being
with a mustache

41:31.933 --> 41:33.363
wearing an identical outfit

41:33.363 --> 41:35.772
with a hat with the letter
of his first name on it?

41:35.772 --> 41:37.367
- Because I don't.

41:38.907 --> 41:40.810
- Do you know him?!
- Stop!

41:40.810 --> 41:42.746
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
I know him.

41:42.746 --> 41:44.946
Yes, I know him.
Yeah, he's my brother Mario,

41:44.946 --> 41:47.586
and he's the best guy
in the world.

41:47.586 --> 41:50.050
Do princesses
find him attractive?

41:50.050 --> 41:52.789
They do if they have good taste!

41:54.692 --> 41:56.122
Get him out of my sight!

41:56.122 --> 41:58.256
We'll see how tough
this Mario is

41:58.256 --> 42:00.830
when he watches me
kill his brother!

42:13.304 --> 42:15.339
Where am I?

42:19.312 --> 42:20.575
Home.

42:20.575 --> 42:23.017
Pay him no heed.

42:23.789 --> 42:26.581
He is cute, but he is...

42:26.581 --> 42:30.794
In an insane world, it is
the sane who is called crazy.

42:35.526 --> 42:37.130
How long you guys been in here?

42:37.130 --> 42:41.035
Time, like hope, is an illusion.

42:41.035 --> 42:42.938
Please!
We are depressed enough!

42:42.938 --> 42:45.743
There's got to be
a way out of here.

42:45.743 --> 42:47.107
There is no escape.

42:47.107 --> 42:50.407
The only hope is
the sweet relief of death.

42:52.112 --> 42:54.477
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

43:18.338 --> 43:19.568
You ready?

43:19.568 --> 43:21.372
Eh... sure.

43:29.578 --> 43:31.789
What?

43:31.789 --> 43:33.956
How you doing?

43:33.956 --> 43:36.728
We are here to see the king.

43:39.258 --> 43:41.161
Follow me.

43:42.032 --> 43:43.526
That gorilla's wearing
a sports coat.

43:43.526 --> 43:44.835

45:25.727 --> 45:27.135
Without your help,

45:27.135 --> 45:29.467
the Mushroom Kingdom
will be annihilated.

45:30.602 --> 45:35.176
What makes you think you're
worthy of fighting alongside

45:35.176 --> 45:40.181
the greatest army in the world?

45:40.181 --> 45:42.051
Because we have heart.

- No, that's not it.

45:49.652 --> 45:52.259

You want my army so badly,
defeat my son

46:14.083 --> 46:18.549
in the Great Ring of Kong!

46:19.222 --> 46:20.518
Give us a second.

46:20.518 --> 46:23.356
This is
a really, really bad idea.

46:23.356 --> 46:25.864
Well, do you have another way
to save my brother?

46:25.864 --> 46:27.965
Are you two done whispering?

46:27.965 --> 46:30.066
It's a little rude.

I put Power-Ups

48:06.690 --> 48:08.131
You're welcome, Mario.

I don't need anything special

48:21.672 --> 48:22.871

Yeah...

49:23.868 --> 49:25.307
Oh...

49:25.307 --> 49:27.969

the wrong mushroom.

49:38.518 --> 49:39.981
Oh!

49:50.169 --> 49:51.465
Get up, Mario!

50:18.659 --> 50:19.988
Had enough?

50:19.988 --> 50:23.134
Not even close.

50:34.180 --> 50:36.477
Mario!

50:36.477 --> 50:39.546
It's-a me.

50:39.546 --> 50:42.681
The box!

50:57.828 --> 50:59.269
Aw!

50:59.269 --> 51:01.370
- He looks adorable.

51:01.370 --> 51:02.998

Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

51:12.249 --> 51:14.416
Okay. Now you die.

51:15.813 --> 51:18.915
Huh. I'm a cat.

51:25.891 --> 51:28.298
Meow.

52:00.198 --> 52:01.859
Had enough?

52:01.859 --> 52:04.631
Not even...

52:04.631 --> 52:06.061
close.

Mario! Mario!

52:28.688 --> 52:32.087
- That was incredible.

52:32.087 --> 52:33.561
He kept beating you senseless...

52:33.561 --> 52:34.562
Hey.

52:34.562 --> 52:36.564
...and you just kept
getting back up?

52:36.564 --> 52:38.192
You just don't know
when to quit.

52:38.192 --> 52:39.534
Huh.

52:39.534 --> 52:41.272
Well, never thought of that
as a good thing.

52:41.272 --> 52:43.197
It's a great thing.

52:43.197 --> 52:45.166
Thanks. I...

52:45.166 --> 52:47.201
I let him win,
just for the record.

52:47.201 --> 52:49.478
Really, though?
Why would you do that?

52:49.478 --> 52:51.007
You want to know why? It's...

52:51.007 --> 52:53.515
Mind your own business!
That's why!

52:53.515 --> 52:55.209
All right, giant monkey.

52:55.209 --> 52:58.322
Enough! Get inside.

52:59.754 --> 53:01.919
We've located Bowser's ship.

53:01.919 --> 53:06.429
He's gonna arrive at the
Mushroom Kingdom by sundown.

53:06.429 --> 53:10.191
Lucky for you guys,
I got a shortcut.

53:10.191 --> 53:12.831
We beat him there
and ambush him.

53:12.831 --> 53:15.064
Yeah, I know.

53:15.064 --> 53:19.277
That's why
we're gonna need karts.

53:36.527 --> 53:39.022
Well, what are you waiting for?

come out of his shell.

and the mustachioed human.

55:33.675 --> 55:37.910
He has defeated Donkey Kong
and won the Kong army.

55:37.910 --> 55:40.242
So, like,
Peach was super impressed?

55:40.242 --> 55:41.914
It appears so, yes.

55:41.914 --> 55:44.180
They are heading toward
their secret passage.

55:44.180 --> 55:46.886
Oh, they think
they can surprise me, huh?

55:46.886 --> 55:49.460
Two can play at that game.

56:10.879 --> 56:15.112
Um, no one panic,
but the road is about to end.

56:15.112 --> 56:18.984
Well, then you better
step on the gas and buckle up!

56:48.277 --> 56:50.048
Woo-hoo!

56:50.886 --> 56:53.414
Is there anything like this
in your world?

56:53.414 --> 56:54.657
What?

56:54.657 --> 56:56.450
Is there anything like this

56:56.450 --> 56:58.419
- in your world?

56:58.419 --> 56:59.827
No.

56:59.827 --> 57:01.763
We don't drive on rainbows.

57:01.763 --> 57:03.457
What are you gonna tell me next?

57:03.457 --> 57:05.668
That the turtles aren't evil?

57:05.668 --> 57:07.934
No, no. They're usually pets.

57:07.934 --> 57:09.133
No way.

57:09.133 --> 57:11.168
Ah, come to Brooklyn.
I'll buy you a turtle.

57:12.510 --> 57:13.940
Maybe I will.

57:13.940 --> 57:16.239
- Dude, is this you flirting?

57:16.239 --> 57:17.713
This is painful.

57:17.713 --> 57:19.407
Just-- I was trying to be nice.

57:19.407 --> 57:20.683
You are so embarrassing.

57:20.683 --> 57:22.520
A princess would never
go out with you.

57:22.520 --> 57:25.050
Yes, she would.
I guarantee she would.

57:25.050 --> 57:27.151
Guys, enough.

57:27.151 --> 57:29.120
All right, all right.

57:37.636 --> 57:39.702
Attack!

57:48.469 --> 57:50.075
It's an ambush!

57:52.913 --> 57:55.179
Defensive positions!

58:10.735 --> 58:12.702
Mario, you're a dead man.

58:16.202 --> 58:18.235
Split up!

58:20.437 --> 58:22.107
Mario!

58:43.702 --> 58:45.702
- Whoa!

58:47.264 --> 58:49.002
Whoa.

59:38.381 --> 59:40.922
I'm too cute to die!

59:49.898 --> 59:52.868
That is how you princess!

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.508
Time to die, Mario.

01:00:23.659 --> 01:00:24.834
Ow!

01:00:27.432 --> 01:00:29.564
- See ya!

01:00:29.564 --> 01:00:31.005
No!

01:00:34.472 --> 01:00:36.571
Woo-hoo!

01:00:36.571 --> 01:00:38.342
Yeah!

01:00:44.579 --> 01:00:47.791
You can't escape me.

01:00:47.791 --> 01:00:48.891
What?

01:00:48.891 --> 01:00:51.861
Blue shell!

01:01:06.172 --> 01:01:08.174
No!

01:01:08.174 --> 01:01:09.978
No, Mario.

01:01:11.540 --> 01:01:13.608
Aah! No.

01:01:13.608 --> 01:01:14.752
No!

01:01:14.752 --> 01:01:16.886
Whoa!

01:01:19.682 --> 01:01:22.859
Get your clown claws off of me!

01:01:25.653 --> 01:01:27.765
Goodbye, Mario.

01:01:27.765 --> 01:01:30.196
We have to get home.

01:01:36.730 --> 01:01:39.568
Hey, this is your fault!

01:01:39.568 --> 01:01:41.570
- My fault? You're the one who...
- Stop talking!

01:01:41.570 --> 01:01:44.782
I don't want the last thing
I hear before I die

01:01:44.782 --> 01:01:46.378
to be your...

01:02:16.112 --> 01:02:19.080
Mario, you saved my life.

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.247
Yeah, well, I won't tell anyone.

01:02:21.247 --> 01:02:22.820
Good. Please don't.

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.052
Okay.

01:02:25.779 --> 01:02:29.255
Uh, did you just feel something?

01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.061
Swim!

01:02:49.574 --> 01:02:51.079
Bowser's on his way.

01:02:51.079 --> 01:02:52.883
You have to evacuate.

01:02:54.775 --> 01:02:58.449
Hurry. Get out of the city!

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.463
Princess?

01:03:12.463 --> 01:03:14.168
We lost the army.

01:03:14.168 --> 01:03:16.665
- And Mario's gone.

01:03:17.875 --> 01:03:20.372
Bowser is coming.

01:03:20.372 --> 01:03:23.177
Head into the forest.
I'll buy you some time.

01:03:23.177 --> 01:03:25.575
You heard her.
Evacuate the city.

01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:29.084
Go with the others.

01:03:29.084 --> 01:03:31.988
I said I wouldn't let
anyone hurt you.

01:03:36.456 --> 01:03:37.356
Run!

01:03:41.791 --> 01:03:43.934
Just leave it. There's no time.

01:04:38.914 --> 01:04:40.848
Princess Peach.

01:04:40.848 --> 01:04:43.059
Brave as ever.

01:04:44.997 --> 01:04:49.032
As you can see,
I have the Super Star.

01:04:49.032 --> 01:04:53.399
If you're going to use it,
use it now.

01:04:55.896 --> 01:04:57.370
No, Princess.

01:04:57.370 --> 01:04:59.768
I stole this star for us.

01:04:59.768 --> 01:05:03.442
I guess love really makes a guy
come out of his shell.

01:05:06.744 --> 01:05:08.810
I told you that line
wouldn't work.

01:05:08.810 --> 01:05:10.581
You're doing great.

01:05:10.581 --> 01:05:15.256
Peaches, with this star,
we will be invincible.

01:05:15.256 --> 01:05:19.788
We can rule the world
together forever.

01:05:19.788 --> 01:05:21.691
Will you marry me?

01:05:21.691 --> 01:05:23.198
Marry you?

01:05:23.198 --> 01:05:24.859
Are you insane?

01:05:24.859 --> 01:05:26.960
I would never marry you.

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:30.799
Maybe you should reconsider.

01:05:32.603 --> 01:05:33.802
No!

01:05:33.802 --> 01:05:35.177
Stop!

01:05:37.014 --> 01:05:38.246
Please stop.

01:05:38.246 --> 01:05:39.412
I'll... I'll-I'll marry you.

01:05:39.412 --> 01:05:41.315
Just don't hurt my Toads.

01:05:46.122 --> 01:05:48.157
You have my word.

01:05:55.232 --> 01:05:57.958
Time for a wedding!

01:06:10.379 --> 01:06:12.313
♪ Life is sad ♪

01:06:12.313 --> 01:06:14.117
♪ Prison is sad ♪

01:06:14.117 --> 01:06:19.012
♪ Life in prison
is very, very sad. ♪

01:06:25.326 --> 01:06:28.428
Ooh, fresh meat for the grinder.

01:06:28.428 --> 01:06:31.068
Who's this ray of sunshine?

01:06:31.068 --> 01:06:34.137
There's no sunshine,
only darkness.

01:06:34.137 --> 01:06:36.172
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

01:06:36.172 --> 01:06:38.438
Hello, prisoners.

01:06:38.438 --> 01:06:40.275
You don't deserve this,

01:06:40.275 --> 01:06:43.476
but you're invited
to the royal wedding!

01:06:43.476 --> 01:06:45.280
Yay!

01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:49.350
Where you will all be
ritualistically sacrificed!

01:06:51.748 --> 01:06:53.651
Oh, no, no, no.

01:06:53.651 --> 01:06:56.049
Finally, mercy.

01:06:57.457 --> 01:06:59.558
Mario.

01:07:11.869 --> 01:07:13.209
So this is the end.

01:07:13.209 --> 01:07:14.903
Being slowly digested
by an eel,

01:07:14.903 --> 01:07:17.114
next to an idiot in overalls.

01:07:17.114 --> 01:07:20.117
Well, at least your brother
isn't gonna die because of you.

01:07:20.117 --> 01:07:21.382
At least you're not gonna die

01:07:21.382 --> 01:07:22.746
with your dad thinking
you're a joke.

01:07:22.746 --> 01:07:25.848
Yeah, well, my dad thinks
I'm a joke, too.

01:07:25.848 --> 01:07:27.850
Yeah? Well...

01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:28.983
your dad's right!

01:07:28.983 --> 01:07:30.391
You know what?
I feel bad enough.

01:07:30.391 --> 01:07:31.854
Just-just leave me alone.

01:07:31.854 --> 01:07:34.428
I've never met your dad,
but he sounds brilliant.

01:07:34.428 --> 01:07:37.827
Just go in a corner and smash
some stuff, smash monkey!

01:07:38.993 --> 01:07:43.096
I am more than a guy

01:07:43.096 --> 01:07:45.142
who smashes things!

01:08:12.763 --> 01:08:16.239
- That was amazing!
- Now we're even!

01:08:45.202 --> 01:08:47.061
Princess, I got it.

01:08:47.061 --> 01:08:48.667
Great job.

01:08:48.667 --> 01:08:51.131
Couldn't have you going
out there without your bouquet.

01:08:51.131 --> 01:08:52.572
It's perfect.

01:09:19.502 --> 01:09:22.338
I'll be sacrificing them
in your honor.

01:09:23.308 --> 01:09:25.132
Lower the prisoners!

01:09:32.449 --> 01:09:34.449
Dearly belov...

01:09:34.449 --> 01:09:36.319
- Huh?

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:38.519
- Drama.

01:09:38.519 --> 01:09:41.115
You really thought
I'd marry you?

01:09:41.115 --> 01:09:43.018
Kinda.

01:09:43.018 --> 01:09:45.658
I'd never marry a monster.

01:09:46.694 --> 01:09:49.695
Then we are breaking up
right now!

01:10:15.052 --> 01:10:16.656
They got to be up there.

01:10:19.254 --> 01:10:21.056
Fire!

01:10:28.703 --> 01:10:31.770
- You want to do this?
- Yes, I do.

01:10:41.045 --> 01:10:42.649
Yes! Fire!

01:10:57.259 --> 01:10:59.435
Woo-hoo!

01:10:59.435 --> 01:11:01.635
This is fun!

01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:03.868
Ha! Loser!

01:11:07.808 --> 01:11:10.072
Hey, what does this do?

01:11:10.072 --> 01:11:12.206
Whoa!

01:11:12.206 --> 01:11:14.417
- Whoa. Yeah.

01:11:14.417 --> 01:11:17.651
Whoa.

01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:20.489
Cool raccoon suit.

01:11:20.489 --> 01:11:22.788
- Really?
- Not at all.

01:11:55.152 --> 01:11:57.086
Whee!

01:12:01.761 --> 01:12:04.159
- Huh?

01:12:10.035 --> 01:12:11.067
Whew.

01:12:11.067 --> 01:12:12.475
Boo.

01:12:22.245 --> 01:12:24.487
Huh?

01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:27.347
- Lu!
- Mario?

01:12:29.890 --> 01:12:31.890
I told you. See?

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:35.927
As long as we're together,
everything is gonna be okay.

01:12:38.798 --> 01:12:41.262
Mario, why do you look
like a bear? What is this?

01:12:45.301 --> 01:12:46.839
You did good, kid.

01:12:46.839 --> 01:12:49.677
Make your pecs dance.
You deserve it.

01:12:49.677 --> 01:12:52.515
No time now. Definitely later.

01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:06.496
Launch the Bomber Bill

01:13:06.496 --> 01:13:09.928
and destroy
the Mushroom Kingdom!

01:13:20.908 --> 01:13:22.875
No.

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:32.115
Hey, hey. Hey, over here.

01:13:42.831 --> 01:13:45.095
You asked for it.

01:13:53.171 --> 01:13:54.808
Hello.

01:14:14.597 --> 01:14:16.896
Ow!

01:14:18.636 --> 01:14:20.163
Really?

01:14:25.005 --> 01:14:27.038
Follow me.

01:14:31.374 --> 01:14:33.583
Come on.

01:14:34.784 --> 01:14:37.048
Little closer.

01:14:38.313 --> 01:14:42.218
Mamma mia!

01:14:52.637 --> 01:14:54.868
- Huh?

01:15:20.828 --> 01:15:22.632
- That's beautiful.
- You made these, right?

01:15:25.131 --> 01:15:27.703
- Huh? Whoa.

01:15:46.757 --> 01:15:48.790
Huh?

01:15:49.518 --> 01:15:50.825
Brooklyn?

01:15:52.387 --> 01:15:53.520
Mario?

01:15:54.730 --> 01:15:57.293
- You almost dented my...

01:16:27.391 --> 01:16:30.062
Mario!

01:16:34.671 --> 01:16:36.398
You want this?

01:16:48.685 --> 01:16:50.445
You ruined my wedding!

01:16:50.445 --> 01:16:53.382
I was finally gonna be happy!

01:16:55.056 --> 01:16:58.761
- Now you will suffer!

01:16:58.761 --> 01:17:01.357
Like me!

01:17:15.439 --> 01:17:18.671
You really thought
you could stop me?

01:17:18.671 --> 01:17:21.883
You worthless,
weak little nothing.

01:17:21.883 --> 01:17:23.885
Come out and fight!

01:17:23.885 --> 01:17:26.250
Or are you too scared?

01:17:30.551 --> 01:17:32.058
Just what I thought.

01:17:50.747 --> 01:17:52.672
MARIO and LUIGI
Mamma mia!

01:17:52.672 --> 01:17:55.114
That's why the Sup-Super
Mario Brothers are here.

01:17:55.114 --> 01:17:57.611
A-to save Brooklyn...
save Brooklyn...

01:17:57.611 --> 01:18:00.218
Brooklyn... save Brooklyn.

01:18:17.974 --> 01:18:20.139
Let's-a go.

01:18:25.045 --> 01:18:26.574
Hey.

01:18:27.643 --> 01:18:29.181
Leave him alone.

01:18:29.181 --> 01:18:31.447
Mario?

01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:34.417
You just don't know
when to quit.

01:18:34.417 --> 01:18:35.649
Yeah.

01:18:35.649 --> 01:18:37.354
I've been told that before.

01:18:40.491 --> 01:18:41.688
Mario!

01:18:44.902 --> 01:18:46.968
The star!

01:18:47.597 --> 01:18:49.069
No! That's mine!

01:19:09.388 --> 01:19:10.486
Lu.

01:19:12.490 --> 01:19:15.458
Nothing can hurt us
as long as we're together.

01:19:26.405 --> 01:19:27.536
No!

01:19:41.519 --> 01:19:42.518
Huh?

01:19:48.425 --> 01:19:51.164
- Rip them to pieces!

01:20:02.947 --> 01:20:04.375
Oh, hey, Spike.

01:20:04.375 --> 01:20:05.673
Luigi?

01:20:20.459 --> 01:20:22.162
- No!

01:20:22.758 --> 01:20:25.000
Mamma mia.

01:21:16.051 --> 01:21:17.646
Peaches.

01:21:17.646 --> 01:21:20.187
Uh, listen, this is not
the way I pictured it,

01:21:20.187 --> 01:21:22.354
but give me one more chance.

01:21:22.354 --> 01:21:24.422
Ew, no.

01:21:24.422 --> 01:21:26.886
No, no, no, no, n...

01:21:26.886 --> 01:21:28.756
Hey! Hey!

01:21:28.756 --> 01:21:30.296
That is not cool!

01:21:30.296 --> 01:21:32.331
Ha! He got the blue mushroom!

01:21:32.331 --> 01:21:34.795
Eh? I told you I'd get you
a pet turtle.

01:21:34.795 --> 01:21:38.007
Not bad, Mustache.

01:21:38.007 --> 01:21:41.043
And, Luigi, you're so brave.

01:21:41.043 --> 01:21:42.440
Oh. Thanks, uh...

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.112
Yeah, it's kind of my thing.

01:21:44.112 --> 01:21:46.840
Oh, my boys, my heroes!

01:21:46.840 --> 01:21:48.545
Woo-hoo!

01:21:48.545 --> 01:21:52.582
Mario, you were amazing.

01:21:52.582 --> 01:21:55.090
Thanks, Dad.

01:21:55.090 --> 01:21:57.125
- Ah, bring it in!

01:22:03.166 --> 01:22:06.860
Let's hear it for
the Super Mario Brothers!

01:22:16.608 --> 01:22:19.048
These are my boys.

01:22:19.048 --> 01:22:20.874
-  H-Hey!

01:22:26.946 --> 01:22:29.058
Yes!
