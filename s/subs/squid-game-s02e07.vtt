03:26.664 --> 03:28.290
When we were in the bathroom,

03:28.291 --> 03:33.211
those fucking X bastards
tried to kill all of us!

03:33.212 --> 03:36.048
They killed some of us,
including my friend--

03:36.049 --> 03:37.425
[Player 047] Bullshit.

03:38.134 --> 03:40.385
You're the ones who started it.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.554
Damn it.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.766
[loudly] They threatened one of the people
on our side!

03:45.767 --> 03:48.393
They attacked us to win the second vote!

03:48.394 --> 03:49.353
[man 1] That's right!

03:49.354 --> 03:50.271
[Player 192] Hey.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.274
You killed one of us first.

03:53.775 --> 03:57.110
You were trying to win the vote
by killing us!

03:57.111 --> 03:59.947
Fuck you. You killed some of us too.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.908
Did you think we would
just let you kill the rest of us?

04:12.335 --> 04:13.336
[Player 145] What?

04:13.878 --> 04:18.256
All right, everyone!
Let's count the numbers!

04:18.257 --> 04:21.885
[Player 203] Yeah, that's right!
Let's count ourselves! Come on down!

04:21.886 --> 04:25.263

- Huh?

05:24.907 --> 05:26.784
What are you doing here?

05:27.368 --> 05:29.537
[Captain] Oh, well...

05:31.497 --> 05:32.915
[drone pilot] Isn't that my drone?

05:33.708 --> 05:36.209
What? Oh, this?

05:36.210 --> 05:39.713
Well, I was looking for something
because I couldn't sleep,

05:39.714 --> 05:41.549
and I just stumbled across it.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.471
Did you do something?

05:47.513 --> 05:50.182
No, I was just looking.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.810
I'm fascinated by how this thing
can fly in the sky.

05:53.811 --> 05:57.397
All right. I'm done now.

05:57.398 --> 05:58.816
It's so fascinating.

05:59.776 --> 06:03.988
You reek of alcohol.
Go get some sleep now, okay?

06:08.242 --> 06:09.202
[drone pilot] Stop!

06:11.245 --> 06:12.079
Who are you really?

- [stabbing]
- [drone pilot yelps]

06:31.182 --> 06:32.141
[Woo-seok] Who's there?

06:35.436 --> 06:37.563
Choi, is that you?

06:38.439 --> 06:39.690
It's me, Captain Park.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.694
[Woo-seok] Captain,
I thought you were asleep.

06:44.695 --> 06:46.947
What are you doing out here?
It's pouring down.

06:46.948 --> 06:49.783
I couldn't sleep.
I was tossing and turning,

06:49.784 --> 06:51.576
then I heard some noise.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.161
I heard it too.

06:53.162 --> 06:55.872
I think I heard someone scream
and some thuds after that.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.416
That's why I came out to take a look.

06:58.417 --> 07:04.215
I think it was the waves hitting the deck.
Look at the mess.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.468
Oh, you're right.

07:09.178 --> 07:12.764
It's dangerous out here in the rain.
Go back inside and get some sleep.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.685
The boat's rocking so much.
I can't really sleep.

07:16.394 --> 07:20.439
Still, you've got to wake up early.
Try to get some sleep.

07:22.066 --> 07:23.484
Or you'll be exhausted tomorrow.

07:37.832 --> 07:42.461
[Jeong-dae] 41, 42, 43, 44, 45,

07:43.129 --> 07:44.547
46,

07:45.381 --> 07:46.549
47.

07:50.386 --> 07:51.888
Three dead.

07:52.847 --> 07:53.763
Are you sure?

07:53.764 --> 07:55.098
I counted three times.

07:55.099 --> 07:56.350
[Player 203] What about them?

07:58.019 --> 08:03.858
[Player 047] 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48.

08:05.484 --> 08:07.153
Two people died on our side.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.866
[woman] Two out of five.
That means they lost three people.

08:13.242 --> 08:16.662
[Se-mi] Then we have a better shot
at winning the vote tomorrow.

08:19.832 --> 08:22.375
[whispering] Hey, it's 48 against 47.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.378
As long as we don't change our minds,
we'll win by one vote!

08:25.379 --> 08:26.630
[players whispering] Yes!

08:26.631 --> 08:29.217
- [man 1] We'll win.
- [man 2] We can get out of here tomorrow.

08:30.509 --> 08:32.052
[PA system chiming]

<i>All players, please return to your beds</i>

08:40.478 --> 08:43.731
<i>- and prepare for bedtime.</i>
- Listen. You cannot change your minds.

08:44.315 --> 08:48.276
We have to win the second vote
and get out of here tomorrow. All right?

08:48.277 --> 08:51.196
[man 3] Don't worry.
We're determined to get out.

08:51.197 --> 08:54.324
[man 4] That's right.
We really have to get out now.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.951
[man 5] Yes, let's do this.

08:55.952 --> 08:59.622
[Jung-bae] All right.
Let's go to sleep now, shall we?

09:08.756 --> 09:10.758
[ominous music]

09:20.851 --> 09:21.686
[timer beeps]

09:29.360 --> 09:30.777
[dark music]

09:30.778 --> 09:32.863
- [radio beeps]
- The delivery team has set out.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.074
[Masked Officer] How are the goods?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.576
[masked soldier]
<i>In top condition this time.</i>

09:39.120 --> 09:40.412
[Masked Officer] And Number 011?

09:40.413 --> 09:43.708
That bitch is behaving.
Won't be a problem anymore.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.376
[Masked Officer]
Keep watching her carefully.

09:46.377 --> 09:48.129
- [masked soldier] <i>Yes, sir.</i>
- [radio beeps]

09:58.639 --> 09:59.890
[Masked Officer] Get ready.

10:03.811 --> 10:05.603
[PA system chiming]

10:05.604 --> 10:09.150
[woman on PA]
<i>The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

- [mysterious music]

10:13.237 --> 10:17.033
<i>please move to your designated locations.</i>

10:18.034 --> 10:20.368
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

10:20.369 --> 10:24.040
<i>The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

10:24.623 --> 10:28.168
<i>Managers, soldiers, and workers,</i>

10:28.169 --> 10:31.964
<i>please move to your designated locations.</i>

10:41.807 --> 10:44.352
[woman on PA] <i>Lights out in 20 minutes.</i>

10:45.061 --> 10:49.273
<i>All players, please prepare for bedtime.</i>

10:53.277 --> 10:55.445
Those bastards are acting suspicious.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.739
It looks like they're up to something.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.656
[Jung-bae scoffs]

10:58.657 --> 11:01.201
Whatever those idiots do,
once we win the vote tomorrow,

11:01.202 --> 11:02.744
it'll all be over.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.163
[Dae-ho] You think we'll be okay?

11:04.747 --> 11:08.376
They say things were really crazy
in the bathroom earlier.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.380
[Gi-hun] Once the lights go out,

11:13.798 --> 11:16.050
people on the other side will attack us.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.260
Really?

11:18.928 --> 11:23.432
Because if they kill us, they'll be able
to win the vote and increase the prize.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.185
So what do we do?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.646
Let's attack them first.

11:31.982 --> 11:36.779
They're probably thinking
we'll just wait for the second vote.

11:37.696 --> 11:39.240
We can use it to our advantage.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.158
We'll attack them first
once the lights go out.

11:42.159 --> 11:45.161
That's right.
It'd be better to attack them first.

11:45.162 --> 11:47.580
We have more women
and elderly on our side.

11:47.581 --> 11:50.042
If we get attacked,
we'll be at a disadvantage.

11:50.918 --> 11:54.421
Attacking them first
would give us a better chance of winning.

11:54.422 --> 11:56.674
- I agree.
- [Gi-hun] We can't do that.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.178
[In-ho] But we have to get out of here.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.306
You said it yourself.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.308
Staying calm won't get us anywhere now.

12:07.309 --> 12:10.688
That doesn't mean
we should kill each other.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.191
That's exactly what they want us to do.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.485
"They"?

12:20.489 --> 12:22.283
Those who created this game.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.744
Those who watch us play.

12:26.620 --> 12:30.541
If we're going to fight someone,
it should be them.

12:33.919 --> 12:36.881
Where are they?

12:42.136 --> 12:43.261
[Gi-hun] Up there.

12:43.262 --> 12:45.347
[eerie music]

12:47.641 --> 12:52.563
On the upper levels
are the rooms they control the games from.

12:53.522 --> 12:55.941
The man in the black mask is their leader.

12:56.942 --> 13:00.696
Once we capture him, we'll be able to win.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.908
[Jung-bae sighs]

13:04.909 --> 13:06.327
How are you going to fight them?

13:08.954 --> 13:10.372
They have guns.

13:15.503 --> 13:20.007
[woman on PA] <i>All armed soldiers,
please move to your designated locations.</i>

13:20.758 --> 13:24.887
<i>The special game will begin momentarily.</i>

13:26.847 --> 13:28.474
We'll fight them with guns too.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.268
But we don't have any.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.313
We'll take their guns.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.529
From those masked men?

13:45.366 --> 13:46.534
[In-ho] That's too dangerous.

13:47.618 --> 13:51.162
Even if we manage to take a few guns,
we'll still be outnumbered.

13:51.163 --> 13:52.623
[Gi-hun] What then?

13:53.207 --> 13:57.962
Are you going to kill each other all night
and hope you survive?

13:59.713 --> 14:02.675
Is that what you want, Young-il?

14:08.013 --> 14:09.139
Do we...

14:10.599 --> 14:11.725
stand a chance?

14:12.309 --> 14:14.061
We do if we catch them off guard.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.771
Out of everyone,

14:16.772 --> 14:20.317
they're the ones
who would least expect us to attack first.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.319
This is

14:23.529 --> 14:28.617
our last chance
to end these games once and for all.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.747
How are you going to take their guns?

14:37.293 --> 14:40.963
Once the fight begins tonight,

14:43.382 --> 14:44.967
we'll have our chance.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.393
[woman on PA] <i>Lights out in five minutes.</i>

15:10.993 --> 15:12.828

15:13.537 --> 15:16.999

15:58.082 --> 15:59.917
When the lights go out, hide.

16:02.127 --> 16:04.380
No matter what happens, don't do anything.

16:07.675 --> 16:08.509
Okay.

16:10.761 --> 16:12.680
And wipe that blood off.

by those planning to attack us.</i>

17:27.004 --> 17:28.005

18:17.971 --> 18:18.889
[woman 2 groans]

18:20.057 --> 18:24.228
[Gi-hun] We have to hide
until the fight ends.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.731
Don't get caught up in the fight.

18:28.398 --> 18:32.820
But that would put people on our side
at quite a disadvantage.

18:34.029 --> 18:38.157
Without us in the fight,
they'll be outnumbered.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.076
[Gi-hun] I know.

18:40.953 --> 18:43.288
But if we fight with them

18:43.997 --> 18:48.836
and some of us end up dead or injured,
it will ruin our entire plan.

18:49.628 --> 18:54.340
We can't beat those bastards
with a lower headcount.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.968
Are you suggesting that

18:57.219 --> 18:59.805
we make a small sacrifice
for the greater good?

19:04.601 --> 19:06.353
If we miss this opportunity,

19:07.813 --> 19:09.940
the sacrifice will be even greater.

19:12.776 --> 19:15.070
Even if it takes a sacrifice...

19:16.154 --> 19:19.283
we must put an end to this game now.

19:25.539 --> 19:26.832
In that case,

21:19.111 --> 21:21.112
<i>They'll try to break up the fight first.</i>

21:21.113 --> 21:22.279
Drop your weapon. Hands up.

21:22.280 --> 21:25.075
<i>They won't pay attention to the dead.</i>

21:27.577 --> 21:30.788
<i>- They will scan our trackers...</i>
- Check the IDs of the dead.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.833

21:38.422 --> 21:39.422

- [dark music]

23:32.702 --> 23:36.747
Move! Do you not see this?

23:36.748 --> 23:39.125
They are not human.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.794
They're like goddamn vermin
blinded by money!

23:41.795 --> 23:43.046
[players exclaiming in fear]

23:45.132 --> 23:47.884
This is not what we took these guns for.

23:48.593 --> 23:52.556
If we do this, we'll be no different
from those masked men.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.058
[breath trembling]

24:04.776 --> 24:05.861
[Gi-hun] Everyone!

24:07.195 --> 24:08.946
Don't be scared.

24:08.947 --> 24:11.073
Gather round, please!

24:11.074 --> 24:12.909
[Jung-bae] It's okay to come out.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.328
We're not trying to hurt you!

24:16.746 --> 24:19.665
[Hyun-ju] Get the guns and ammo
from the dead.

24:19.666 --> 24:21.501
[Gi-hun] Come on! I have something to say!

24:29.426 --> 24:31.344
[Masked Officer] Gather all soldiers.

[epic music]

25:08.298 --> 25:09.257
[Gi-hun] Everyone.

25:11.051 --> 25:11.885
We will now

25:13.136 --> 25:17.474
head up to the masked men's headquarters.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.644
We'll capture the ones who captured us,

25:21.394 --> 25:23.063
put an end to this game,

25:23.939 --> 25:25.565
and make them pay.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.779
Anyone who knows how to use a gun

25:32.239 --> 25:35.742
and wishes to join us,
please step forward.

25:56.596 --> 25:57.514
Hey.

25:59.307 --> 26:00.809
I know you're scared.

26:02.894 --> 26:04.396
I'm scared too.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.690
But this may be

26:07.732 --> 26:11.069
our last chance
to make it out of this place alive.

26:12.654 --> 26:13.947
Fight with us

26:15.240 --> 26:16.574
so we can go home together.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.077
All together.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.375
I'll fight with you.

26:26.251 --> 26:27.085
Come on.

26:28.628 --> 26:30.004
[Player 072] I'll join you too.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.006
[Gi-hun] Come join us.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.210
Please check your guns and ammo.

27:10.253 --> 27:12.212
Let's take one radio each.

27:12.213 --> 27:13.213
[radio beeps]

27:13.214 --> 27:15.425
We'll use channel 7, the lucky number.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.391
Thank you for earlier.

27:27.604 --> 27:30.899
You can buy me soju when we get out.

27:41.576 --> 27:42.577
Attention.

27:44.287 --> 27:46.748
This is the MP5, a submachine gun.

27:47.374 --> 27:50.918
First, if you press this lever
in the middle and pull the magazine,

27:50.919 --> 27:52.836
it comes off like this.

27:52.837 --> 27:56.590
If the selector switch is down,
it's set to full auto mode.

27:56.591 --> 27:58.259
Up is single-fire mode.

27:58.843 --> 28:03.305
We don't have many magazines,
so set it to single-fire mode.

28:03.306 --> 28:05.766
Lastly, insert the magazine,

28:05.767 --> 28:08.435
pull the handle, and then release it.

28:08.436 --> 28:11.438
That's how you load it. Are we clear?

28:11.439 --> 28:12.941
[all] Yes.

28:16.319 --> 28:18.655
How do you know so much about guns?

28:21.449 --> 28:24.661
I was a sergeant first class
in the ROK Special Forces.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.371
Ah.

28:29.165 --> 28:30.165
[gun cocks]

28:30.166 --> 28:31.209
Take it off.

28:43.179 --> 28:44.514
Take that off too.

28:51.354 --> 28:52.647
[Jung-bae] Good God.

28:53.898 --> 28:56.359
Do your parents know
what you're doing here?

29:01.990 --> 29:04.701
Take us to your captain.

<i>Otherwise,
you will be eliminated from the game.</i>

30:04.802 --> 30:06.387
<i>Let me repeat.</i>

30:07.305 --> 30:09.640
<i>All players, it is bedtime...</i>

30:09.641 --> 30:13.143

in my dreams. Don't you?

- [all] Yes.
- [Player 145] Yes, I'm okay!

31:22.505 --> 31:24.841
All right, then. Let's go up!

32:19.395 --> 32:20.980
Is this the right way?

32:23.066 --> 32:26.653
The entrance to the management area
is around that corner.

32:27.695 --> 32:29.530
The control room is right above it.

32:30.948 --> 32:31.782
Move it, then.

32:31.783 --> 32:32.992
Wait.

32:34.702 --> 32:35.869
What are you doing?

32:35.870 --> 32:37.830

Will you be able to find it?
Should I come?

33:28.631 --> 33:32.885
I'll go with Jung-bae.
I need you to buy us some time!

[Jung-bae] Why did you have to bring me
instead of Young-il?

34:58.971 --> 35:01.766
Because you're my friend.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.018
You only say that when you're in a jam.

35:05.019 --> 35:05.937
[radio beeps]

35:06.604 --> 35:08.231
We're in the management area.

35:08.856 --> 35:10.566
<i>We'll make our way up.</i>

35:46.394 --> 35:48.521
[Gi-hun] They have magazines
in their pockets.

36:03.494 --> 36:04.787
Which way should we go?

36:07.957 --> 36:09.667
The way they came.

36:20.052 --> 36:22.178
[Masked Officer]
Guard the stairs to the control room!

This isn't getting us anywhere!
Let's follow them to the upper level!

37:21.072 --> 37:23.950
We might get surrounded
if we move together without a plan!

37:25.284 --> 37:28.829
Let's wait until
they find the control room!

Everyone! Check your magazines!

[Jung-bae] <i>Young-il, Dae-ho.

38:31.559 --> 38:32.726
- [radio beeps]
- Go ahead!

38:32.727 --> 38:34.894
I think we're right below
the control room!

38:34.895 --> 38:38.024
But we need backup and more ammo.

38:38.691 --> 38:40.442
We're running out of ammo too!

38:40.443 --> 38:44.070
[Gi-hun] There should be spare magazines
in the soldiers' pockets in our quarters.

38:44.071 --> 38:45.613
Go get them!

38:45.614 --> 38:46.699
- Got it!
- [radio beeps]

38:47.491 --> 38:50.536
Did you hear that? They need backup!

38:51.162 --> 38:54.539
Three of us will go,
and the rest will stay!

38:54.540 --> 38:57.167
Join us once you get the magazines!

38:57.168 --> 38:58.376
Who wants to go with me?

Let's go!

39:06.135 --> 39:08.303
I'll go get the magazines!

39:08.304 --> 39:11.681
I'll come back as soon as I can,
so just hold on until then!

Do you know the way?

39:25.905 --> 39:27.280
[shakily] Yes.

39:27.281 --> 39:30.742
We destroyed the cameras on the way.
Follow them.

39:30.743 --> 39:31.660
Okay.

39:32.787 --> 39:36.248
Take this. You might run into
the masked men on the way.

39:36.957 --> 39:37.791
Thank you.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.752
I'll cover you. Go!

Yes, brother. I'm on my way to get them.

40:38.394 --> 40:39.644
What are you going to do?

40:39.645 --> 40:40.687
Get their magazines.

40:40.688 --> 40:42.313
No, that's too dangerous.

40:42.314 --> 40:46.276
I'm almost out of ammo.
If they notice, they'll close in on us.

40:46.277 --> 40:49.738
We need more magazines
to hold out until Dae-ho gets here.

41:48.923 --> 41:50.216
[Jung-bae] Gi-hun, hurry up!

41:57.598 --> 41:59.141
[Jung-bae] Hurry up and get back here!

I'm not sure.

42:29.922 --> 42:31.048
[breath trembling]

42:34.969 --> 42:37.638
[Yong-sik] Dae-ho, what happened?

42:38.347 --> 42:40.265
Why are you back by yourself?

42:40.266 --> 42:41.267
Magazines.

42:41.767 --> 42:46.020
Get the magazines

Are you all right?

42:52.486 --> 42:54.195
I'm fine. It's just a graze.

42:54.196 --> 42:57.240
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.451
Don't worry. I'll be sure to outlive you.

43:01.912 --> 43:04.872
[In-ho] Gi-hun!
Did you find the control room?

43:04.873 --> 43:07.709
I think it's right up there,
but we can't go this way.

43:07.710 --> 43:09.711
I want you to find another way.

43:09.712 --> 43:14.090
I did a quick scan of the layout here.
I'm sure there's a way to go around them.

43:14.091 --> 43:17.093
I want you guys
to keep their focus on you.

43:17.094 --> 43:18.469
We'll hit them from behind.

43:18.470 --> 43:19.471
Okay.

43:19.972 --> 43:20.888
Wait.
