00:51.761 --> 00:52.845
<i>All right, Chevy.</i>

00:53.763 --> 00:55.806
<i>Chevy,
you're very handsome.</i>

00:55.806 --> 00:57.558
-<i>Stop it.</i>
- <i>How did you become so funny?</i>

00:57.558 --> 00:58.684
<i>What was the first part?</i>

00:59.769 --> 01:02.229
<i>Lorne said if I just
stared into the camera,</i>

01:02.229 --> 01:03.898
<i>that'd take a lot of guts.</i>

01:06.817 --> 01:10.738
<i>"There were bells on the hill,
but I never heard them ringing."</i>

01:12.531 --> 01:13.783
<i>Action, Laraine.</i>

01:21.332 --> 01:22.333
<i>Hi.</i>

01:23.375 --> 01:25.211
Did I spell your name right?

01:28.005 --> 01:30.341
<i>I'm Garrett Morris talking
to all you white Americans...</i>

01:30.466 --> 01:33.010
<i>about the way Black people
have been treated in America.</i>

01:33.469 --> 01:36.555
<i>Now, I know a lot of you
feel guilty, and you should.</i>

01:38.933 --> 01:41.852
<i>You see, um,
having a catheter...</i>

01:42.019 --> 01:43.938
<i>a lot of people
think it's funny.</i>

01:44.104 --> 01:46.732
<i>And they like to see me dance.</i>

01:48.526 --> 01:52.238
<i>Now, I look up, and I see it
coming down now, real quick...</i>

01:52.404 --> 01:53.697
<i>and I see discs.</i>

01:53.864 --> 01:55.074
<i>Whirlin' discs!</i>

01:55.991 --> 01:57.034
<i>- Really?</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

01:57.201 --> 01:58.494
<i>Radney?</i>

01:58.661 --> 02:00.538
<i>I'm not gonna talk about... No.</i>

02:00.996 --> 02:02.998
<i>Whirlin'. Whirlin' around,
whirlin' around.</i>

02:02.998 --> 02:04.333
<i>I see all kinds of lights.
Then they just drop me.</i>

02:04.500 --> 02:06.961
<i>In order to get that much iron,
you probably have to overeat.</i>

02:07.127 --> 02:10.840
<i>Send your check or money order
to White Guilt Relief Fund.</i>

02:11.006 --> 02:13.008
<i>We're ready? Should we go?</i>

02:17.388 --> 02:18.597
Free show!

02:20.224 --> 02:22.268
Plenty of tickets left, guys!
Free show!

02:22.810 --> 02:23.811
No?

02:24.603 --> 02:26.272
Hey, free show, man.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.441
Hey, sir, free comedy show?
Plenty of seats.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.360
Perfect for date night!

02:32.069 --> 02:32.903
Um...

02:33.529 --> 02:36.365
"You are invited
to a new variety spectacular...

02:36.532 --> 02:39.076
"featuring a parade of comedy...

02:39.243 --> 02:40.619
"and musical acts
ripped from the charts."

02:41.912 --> 02:43.163
Jesus Christ.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.665
"Where did they unearth
such a cavalcade of talent?"

02:47.126 --> 02:48.669
Hey, man! You okay?

02:50.004 --> 02:52.423
Maybe ask me again
in 90 minutes.

02:53.090 --> 02:54.508
Why?
What happens in 90 minutes?

02:54.967 --> 02:56.093
Uh, we go live.

02:56.427 --> 02:59.054
Oh, wow. Far out, man. Congrats.
Miss?

02:59.221 --> 03:00.973
- Thank you.
-Hey, wait. If it's live,

03:01.140 --> 03:02.683
then why the hell
are you down here?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.643
- Free show. For fuck's sake.
- I'm...

03:04.810 --> 03:06.186
-Mr. Michaels?
- ...waiting for...

03:06.395 --> 03:07.229
Ah!

03:07.563 --> 03:09.773
It's 10 o'clock, Andy.
Here. Come on.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.817
Where do I park?

03:11.984 --> 03:14.320
"You are invited
to a new variety spectacular..."

03:14.486 --> 03:15.863
Just pick him up at 1:00,
Mrs. Kaufman.

03:15.863 --> 03:16.947
Do you like my suit?

03:17.114 --> 03:18.157
- Very elegant, Andy.
- Take care of my Andy!

03:18.324 --> 03:19.867
This is my favorite suit.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.952
"Where did they unearth
such a cavalcade of talent?"

03:22.953 --> 03:24.079
Bye. Bye, Mommy.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.080
Bye, honey.

03:25.080 --> 03:25.998
- I love you!
-Andy, come on.

03:32.630 --> 03:33.631
Andy, please, come on.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.382
This is beautiful.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.550
Yeah.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.801
You know, actually, down there

03:37.801 --> 03:38.886
is where Diego Rivera
was hired...

03:39.053 --> 03:41.263
to paint a fresco
for the American worker.

03:41.430 --> 03:42.473
I cannot see this.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.558
Well, no one can
because Diego was a commie...

03:44.725 --> 03:46.226
and added Vladimir Lenin
in the middle of the night...

03:46.226 --> 03:47.603
so the Rockefellers
had it plastered over.

03:47.603 --> 03:48.687
Deliveries use the back.

03:48.687 --> 03:49.980
- I'm producer of the show.
- Where's your badge?

03:49.980 --> 03:51.273
- My...
- Where's his badge?

03:51.273 --> 03:52.358
Look, my name is Lorne Michaels.

03:52.358 --> 03:53.442
I'm the producer
of <i>Saturday Night.</i>

03:53.442 --> 03:54.610
- The whole night?
-Hey! Hey! He's good.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.320
- Yeah, I'm producing every show.
- He's good. He's good.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.696
- I'm good, you see?
- Let him in. Let him in.

03:57.696 --> 03:58.781
Live on a Saturday night?
Must be some show.

03:58.781 --> 03:59.865
I'm good. Andy, please.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.200
Hey, you're doing a great job.
Really. Great stuff.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.576
What kind of name
is <i>"Saturday Night"?</i>

04:02.576 --> 04:04.912
- Andy, come on. Please.
- Okay. We rushing.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.372
Eighth floor, and book it.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.123
Put on your seat belts.

04:10.501 --> 04:12.294
So, big night.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.754
Oh, Andy,
have you had dinner?

04:13.754 --> 04:16.173
Huh. Yes, I had spaghetti.

04:16.173 --> 04:17.341
Oh, that sounds delicious.

04:17.508 --> 04:19.218
Hey, Lorne, I'm getting calls
from upstairs.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.344
You ordered a llama?

04:20.511 --> 04:21.512
A llama?

04:21.679 --> 04:23.973
Yeah. We all decided it was
much funnier than a donkey.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.391
Right. Just the guys
down at the loading dock

04:25.391 --> 04:27.017
weren't expecting,
you know, livestock.

04:27.184 --> 04:29.395
Well, NBC did ask for something
fresh and unexpected.

04:29.561 --> 04:30.854
That is true. That's true.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.147
Uh, just, you know,
they also weren't

04:32.147 --> 04:33.232
expecting you to demand...

04:33.399 --> 04:35.651
an overhaul in the entire
lighting and sound package.

04:37.361 --> 04:39.571
Did anyone ask Edison
what a light bulb was

04:39.738 --> 04:41.198
before he harnessed electricity?

04:42.700 --> 04:44.368
Who are you in the metaphor?

04:45.119 --> 04:46.578
The light bulb?

04:46.996 --> 04:48.539
We can't expect people
to recognize

04:48.706 --> 04:49.832
something they've
never seen before.

04:49.999 --> 04:51.375
Right. Okay. Yes.
You're correct.

04:51.542 --> 04:52.793
But just,
how about a final script?

04:52.960 --> 04:53.961
It's not that kind of show.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.504
Okay. Well,
what kind of show is it, Lorne?

04:55.671 --> 04:56.839
Do you even know
what the show is?

04:57.006 --> 04:58.007
Of course.

04:58.716 --> 05:00.050
Are you gonna share it
with the rest of us?

05:00.217 --> 05:02.011
Yes.

05:02.553 --> 05:03.554
In 88 minutes.

05:03.721 --> 05:05.389
Oh, my God.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.182
Uh, have you tested
the quality of the sound system?

05:07.349 --> 05:08.434
- No, I haven't.
- 'Cause the speakers...

05:08.600 --> 05:10.394
look leftover
from Arturo Toscanini.

05:10.561 --> 05:11.687
I mean,
that's not really my job.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.063
Lorne,
did you order more lights?

05:13.230 --> 05:14.231
Of course.

05:14.898 --> 05:15.983
Is this your card?

05:15.983 --> 05:17.067
How'd he do that?

05:17.067 --> 05:18.485
He's a fuckin' magician,
numb nuts.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.195
-Hey, Neil?
- Oh, hey.

05:20.362 --> 05:22.531
You got to be right by my side,
man. Locked to my hip.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.907
Remember, when you're here,
you're not my cousin...

05:23.907 --> 05:25.200
you're my executive assistant.
You're important.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.368
Really? Like in the credits
it will say that?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.578
Well, no,
but you and I will know.

05:27.578 --> 05:28.662
They're looking for you
in the control room.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.539
Also, Belushi hasn't signed
his contract yet?

05:30.539 --> 05:32.583
- Oh, and the llama has arrived.
- Oh, great. Thanks, Barbara.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.835
Neil, memo. We need to reeducate
the NBC Pages on the show.

05:34.835 --> 05:35.919
You should've heard
the guy outside.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.004
What the hell is this?

05:37.004 --> 05:39.298
<i>Saturday Night,</i> it's a new kind
of entertainment.

05:39.298 --> 05:42.509
It's abstract and defiant.
Avant-garde yet blue collar...

05:48.640 --> 05:50.392
Gilda, come on.
We need you for rehearsal.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.229
Oh, be careful.
They're still drying.

05:54.396 --> 05:55.981
This is
monumental work, Edie.

05:56.148 --> 05:58.567
Mr. Gresner, would you please
tell our studio audience...

05:58.734 --> 06:00.277
Jane, you're still attached.

06:00.444 --> 06:03.280
...just how you became a victim
of a shark bite?

06:04.156 --> 06:05.741
You are so fluffy.

06:05.908 --> 06:07.034
Hey, come on, Andy.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.369
You cut my Nazi Doctor Dolittle?

06:09.787 --> 06:11.663
He has ways
of making the animals talk?

06:11.830 --> 06:13.040
I'll check
with the run-of-show board.

06:13.207 --> 06:15.209
Package was addressed
to Al Franken and Tom Davis.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.752
I don't know
what to tell you, fellas.

06:16.752 --> 06:17.961
How do you lose
28 gallons of blood?

06:19.546 --> 06:21.757
85 minutes till showtime.

06:21.924 --> 06:24.802
Come on, guys. These transitions
need to be crisp.

06:24.968 --> 06:27.179
Pretend like there's a hooker
holding a sandwich

06:27.179 --> 06:28.430
waiting for you stage right.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.224
We still need
to rehearse five sketches.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.267
Are we any closer
on lighting cues?

06:32.434 --> 06:34.144
Hey, Schiller.
What are you up to?

06:34.311 --> 06:36.688
I'm burning sage.
Removing demons.

06:36.855 --> 06:38.107
Garrett don't do voodoo.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.942
Peter packed
a peck of pickled peckers.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.486
Andy, this is Billy Crystal
and Valri Bromfield.

06:42.653 --> 06:43.821
- They're both in the show.
- Andy!

06:43.987 --> 06:46.031
They're both very nice.
Please stay with them, okay?

06:46.198 --> 06:48.075
Listen, Andy is
a certifiable comedic genius.

06:48.242 --> 06:49.243
- He is redefining the form.
- Nice to meet you, Andy.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.411
I mean, we are
in the presence of greatness.

06:53.038 --> 06:54.123
Where is the bathroom?

06:54.123 --> 06:55.499
Neil, can you show Andy
to the washroom?

06:55.499 --> 06:57.209
- Yeah. Yeah.
- There you are. Lorne. I can't

06:57.209 --> 06:58.752
- authorize the purchase...
- Dick. Dick.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.170
...of an antique chandelier.

07:00.170 --> 07:01.255
Jim has a question
about something.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.548
- Here. Let's step over here.
-He's out of control.

07:02.548 --> 07:04.299
- Okay. I understand.
- This isn't a budget.

07:04.299 --> 07:05.384
It's a ransom note.

07:05.384 --> 07:06.510
Someone asked for last
Friday's <i>Johnny Carson?</i>

07:06.510 --> 07:07.678
Where the fuck you been,
Charlie?

07:07.678 --> 07:08.762
Sorry, I've been busy.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.847
I'll be back
in a little bit, okay?

07:09.847 --> 07:11.306
Hope I still have a job
when he's gone next week.

07:11.306 --> 07:13.016
Okey-dokes. So, as it stands...

07:13.183 --> 07:15.435
we have four host monologues,
two stand-ups...

07:15.602 --> 07:17.521
two musical guests,
each with two performances...

07:17.688 --> 07:18.981
a solo piece for Andy Kaufman...

07:19.148 --> 07:21.275
five parody commercials,
Weekend Update...

07:21.441 --> 07:22.484
a film by Albert Brooks...

07:22.651 --> 07:25.070
Jim Henson's Muppet... thing.

07:25.237 --> 07:27.239
Not to mention seven sketches.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.782
- Something for everybody.
- Yeah, it's a lot of show.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.284
- It won't fit.
- We don't know that.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.953
I know that. The dress rehearsal
was three hours.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.121
Audrey thinks we're tight.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.456
Audrey thinks it's time to make
some tough decisions, actually.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.624
Lorne, just cut some things.

07:37.791 --> 07:39.251
- No. We will, but...
-Am I still in the show?

07:42.379 --> 07:43.839
Jesus Christ.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.133
- Sorry. Tripped over my penis.
- Still on the show, Chev.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.801
Oh, I know.
Hey, you remember Jackie.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.178
- My girlfriend.
- Fiancée.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.387
It looks expensive.

07:50.387 --> 07:51.471
She is.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.556
It is.

07:52.556 --> 07:53.724
I never know
when you're kidding.

07:53.724 --> 07:54.808
Hey, Chev, can I...

07:54.975 --> 07:56.393
Can you show a little goodwill
to your co-star?

07:56.560 --> 07:57.895
- Who? Belushi?
- Mmm-hmm.

07:58.061 --> 08:00.397
God! God!
What the fuck's the matter now?

08:00.564 --> 08:02.065
I think
it's just a new dynamic and...

08:02.232 --> 08:03.442
there are a lot
of expectations for every...

08:03.442 --> 08:04.526
I'll tell you what the issue is.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.361
We're not doing
a radio hour anymore

08:06.361 --> 08:07.779
and he's built like
an Albanian cheeseburger.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.199
Chevy can't help if people
are responding to his face.

08:10.365 --> 08:11.491
I mean, I could, but I won't.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.993
Right. Well, no one's asking you

08:12.993 --> 08:14.620
to deny your own magnetism,
Chevy.

08:14.786 --> 08:16.413
Maybe there's other roles
for John to play.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.415
Like a hobo. Or a troll.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.918
Or a fire hydrant.
Or a Volkswagen.

08:21.084 --> 08:23.086
Or a hemorrhoid.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.797
- You're looking sharp, Patches.
-  What?

08:26.215 --> 08:27.424
You have
to cut something.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.343
Yeah. Yeah.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.388
- Neil?
- Oh. Yeah!

08:33.555 --> 08:35.641
Get me a key to this door.
In fact...

08:36.058 --> 08:37.476
I want keys to all the doors.

08:37.643 --> 08:38.977
In the building?

08:39.144 --> 08:40.854
- If you can.
- Yeah.

08:43.774 --> 08:45.692
Frame up on the shot,
okay, Cameron?

08:46.151 --> 08:47.152
That's good.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.947
Ready camera 2. That looks okay.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.031
Hey, guys.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.741
Hey, Lorne.
Can you get down or around?

08:52.908 --> 08:54.368
Down in front.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.203
Dave, how're we looking?

08:56.203 --> 08:57.454
Oh. Good, good, good.
Good, good.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.040
Still working on the 47 notes
you gave me on your last visit.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.709
Okay. How's the morale looking
out there?

09:03.126 --> 09:04.211
-"Morale"?
- Mm-hmm.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.339
Oh, I think I can speak
for the entire crew...

09:07.506 --> 09:11.760
when I say this is exactly where
we want to be on Saturday night.

09:13.262 --> 09:14.930
- Okay. Great.
-Yeah. Yeah.

09:15.514 --> 09:17.766
Rocky! Wake up, will you?

09:18.267 --> 09:21.436
Give me lights 25B, 25C!

09:23.272 --> 09:25.440
Half down on 31! That's 32!

09:25.607 --> 09:27.276
You've done this before, right?

09:27.442 --> 09:28.443
Man,
that's a lot of lights.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.195
Charlie, you're gonna drop
a testicle lifting that thing.

09:30.362 --> 09:31.405
Good job, Charlie.

09:31.530 --> 09:32.531
All right. Quiet, please!

09:32.698 --> 09:35.409
Here we go. Rehearsal's up.
Actors on their marks.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.868
All right. Hey, guys.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.288
We only have two minutes
of commercials...

09:39.454 --> 09:41.832
to make it from stage right
to stage left.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.583
Anybody know
the load bearing on the booms?

09:43.750 --> 09:45.669
- Hello, fellas.
- What's up, Joe?

09:45.836 --> 09:47.462
Can I get you anything?
Refreshment?

09:47.629 --> 09:48.922
- Mai Tai?
-I'll take a Schaefer.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.924
Try and at least act like
you're fucking working, please.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.384
John, thank you
for your patience.

09:52.384 --> 09:53.468
Moments away, okay?

09:54.761 --> 09:57.597
All right. Next card.
"Al 'Bud' Franken."

09:58.265 --> 09:59.558
Next card. "Tom 'Bud' Davis."

09:59.725 --> 10:01.685
Okay. So, this is a bit?

10:01.852 --> 10:03.895
Look, I don't get
half the shit that they do.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.023
Next card, "Rosie 'Bud'..."
Uh...

10:06.815 --> 10:09.276
Lorne, is Rosie going
with Michaels or Shuster?

10:10.068 --> 10:12.571
- That's a good question.
-Should I ask Rosie?

10:12.571 --> 10:14.239
No, no, no.
I'll take care of it.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.158
-All right.
-Stew, that's good.

10:16.325 --> 10:17.617
That's actually looking good.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.578
A little more over.

10:19.995 --> 10:21.079
She's been at it for hours.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.539
She's simply doing her job.

10:22.539 --> 10:23.874
We have to comply
with NBC standards.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.167
Well, I refuse to comply.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.002
- Uh, Mr. O'Donoghue.
- Mmm-hmm?

10:27.627 --> 10:31.214
On page 12, what is clam diving?

10:33.175 --> 10:36.011
I believe
the act of harvesting mollusks.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.804
Stew!
You're killing me here.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.222
I just need the lights
for Home Invasion.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.016
Talk to the wonder kid!
He's trying to light

10:41.016 --> 10:42.934
<i>- Jesus Christ Superstar!</i>
-Those are excuses.

10:42.934 --> 10:44.603
Four people up there,
get them lit.

10:44.770 --> 10:47.564
I'm glad you're having fun,
but this isn't helpful.

10:47.731 --> 10:49.900
If that piglet
disfigures my work...

10:50.067 --> 10:52.694
I'm gonna turn her uterus
into a sock puppet.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.988
What is "Zipper Dinner"?

11:00.118 --> 11:02.079
How many of these
did you hide in the script?

11:02.245 --> 11:04.956
Maybe a dozen.
It's like a scavenger hunt.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.416
I know what blue balls are.

11:06.583 --> 11:07.584
You don't say.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.587
Come on, people, move
with purpose. Let's do this.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.006
Al, is that your one?
Come on, give it.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.884
All right. Quiet, please!
Rehearsal is up.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.260
Assault and burglary.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.137
Okay. Actors on your marks, please.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.389
Cameras on their marks.

11:20.389 --> 11:21.473
- Here we go.
- Hey.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.397
Okay! Let's see if we can
get through one of these skits.

11:28.563 --> 11:30.065
Sketches! Davy, please.

11:30.065 --> 11:31.149
And action on rehearsals.

11:31.149 --> 11:32.776
Okay. Ready, Camera One?
Take Camera One.

11:34.069 --> 11:37.322
Look, honey. <i>Boeing Boeing</i> with
Jerry Lewis is on in 10 minutes.

11:37.489 --> 11:39.616
Ready, Camera Two?
Take Camera Two.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.035
<i>Uh, sweetheart, I'm tired.
I think I'm just gonna...</i>

11:42.202 --> 11:44.287
have another glass
of diet root beer

11:44.287 --> 11:45.956
and go to bed, okay?

11:47.749 --> 11:49.626
-Aykroyd!
- Cue, Danny.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.215
What's the problem?

11:55.382 --> 11:56.591
What's going on, Dan?

11:57.050 --> 11:58.385
It's a little lodged.

11:59.636 --> 12:00.720
Hi, there!

12:00.887 --> 12:01.972
Please do not be alarmed.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.890
This is only a simulated
assault and burglary.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.309
Repeat. This is a simulated
assault and burglary.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.103
This could happen to you
at any time. In fact...

12:08.103 --> 12:09.229
<i>- it just has.</i>
-<i>Call the police!</i>

12:09.229 --> 12:10.313
<i>No, no!</i>

12:10.480 --> 12:12.399
Don't call the police.
I am the police.

12:12.566 --> 12:13.525
Well, I might be, anyway.

12:14.651 --> 12:16.570
- Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Kromer...
-Hold!

12:16.945 --> 12:18.864
Aykroyd, one giant step
to the right, please.

12:19.197 --> 12:20.198
Yeah. My right?

12:20.198 --> 12:21.241
- Yes.
-Sure.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.243
Uh, say, man, you want me
to say anything in this?

12:23.410 --> 12:26.204
Or am I the silent robber type?

12:26.371 --> 12:28.373
I think we're gonna
stick to the script this time.

12:28.540 --> 12:29.833
- What script?
-Thanks, Garrett.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.252
Okay. Here we go.
And action on rehearsal.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.629
Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Kromer.

12:34.796 --> 12:35.922
<i>My name is Kenny Vorstrather.</i>

12:36.548 --> 12:38.467
<i>I'm president
of Trojan Horse Home Security.</i>

12:38.717 --> 12:40.844
I have broken into your home
tonight to illustrate to you...

12:41.011 --> 12:42.012
...and your family just how...

12:42.012 --> 12:43.555
Watch out!

12:44.681 --> 12:45.807
Shit!

12:45.807 --> 12:47.058
Have your girders
been checked?

12:47.058 --> 12:48.393
Piece of shit!
You fucking piece of shit!

12:48.393 --> 12:50.520
I'll fucking break
your fucking jaw!

12:51.396 --> 12:53.815
Play the cameras back.
Play the cameras back. Let's go.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.776
John, are you hurt?

12:56.776 --> 12:57.861
Jesus Christ!

12:58.028 --> 12:59.070
You okay?

12:59.070 --> 13:01.156
Need a new gun.
Where's props for me, please?

13:01.156 --> 13:02.449
Can somebody
clear the children, please?

13:02.449 --> 13:03.575
Excuse me. Watch out, please.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.410
Why? You got
any more fucking lights

13:05.410 --> 13:06.661
you want to drop on us?

13:06.828 --> 13:08.705
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe, motherfucker!

13:08.705 --> 13:10.499
Want me to break
your fucking jaw for you?

13:10.499 --> 13:11.625
Fucking amateur hour!

13:11.625 --> 13:13.710
I'll bust your fucking jaw
for you, motherfucker!

13:13.877 --> 13:16.171
Hey! Hey! How dare you
endanger my actors?

13:16.171 --> 13:17.255
Lorne. Lorne, it's not worth it.

13:17.255 --> 13:18.340
Really? Yeah.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.467
You're the one asking
for 100 fucking light cues, pal!

13:20.467 --> 13:22.719
Well, feel free to let me know
when my expectations

13:22.719 --> 13:23.803
surpass your abilities.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.055
There's a shit-ton of lights.
It's not worth it.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.015
You know, I don't know, guys.
It was kind of exciting.

13:27.182 --> 13:28.517
Like, it's probably good luck.

13:29.601 --> 13:30.602
Wallie.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.397
Uh. this thing's not gonna work.
I need...

13:34.397 --> 13:35.482
Something with
a little more heft.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.317
It's got no stopping power.
You know what I mean?

13:37.317 --> 13:38.777
The script said pistol.

13:39.611 --> 13:40.779
Well, the script
specifically called for...

13:40.946 --> 13:43.615
a Smith and Wesson
K-Frame Model 19 Combat Magnum.

13:43.782 --> 13:44.824
Do we go again?

13:44.824 --> 13:46.743
Uh, in this deathtrap?

13:46.910 --> 13:47.911
Well, we've worked out
the kinks.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.330
You know, I still think
it was kind of funny.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.249
How high will this thing go, Al?

13:52.415 --> 13:54.000
- Gilda. Gilda.
- Say hello to the cameras, boys.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.378
There's home base...

13:56.545 --> 13:57.754
Kid, this ain't an armory.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.589
No one's gonna notice
the difference.

13:59.756 --> 14:00.757
I'll tell you who'll notice.

14:00.757 --> 14:01.925
A few of the fine folks
at home...

14:01.925 --> 14:03.760
who lugged M16s through
four feet of swamp juice

14:03.760 --> 14:04.844
in Quang Nam.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.304
Hey, boys!

14:06.471 --> 14:08.306
Guess I picked the wrong day
to not wear underwear.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.391
Don't look too hard.

14:09.391 --> 14:10.475
Proud of yourself?

14:10.475 --> 14:12.185
I'll give you and this circus
till the end of the week.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.062
That's funny. 'Cause I give you
till the end of the day.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.524
All right, everyone.
Let's get this thing cleaned up.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.441
Ah, ah, ah, ah...

14:18.441 --> 14:21.403
Grab a light, broom, dustpan.
We'll get all this glass.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.529
Mmm-mmm.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.532
Thank you, <i>hermano.</i>

14:27.117 --> 14:28.159
All right, Neil,
not with the keys right now.

14:33.999 --> 14:37.085
Pow, pow! Pow, pow!

14:37.752 --> 14:39.087
Hey, come on, man.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.755
Violence? Really?

14:41.590 --> 14:44.009
Ha-ha! My main man, Jim!

14:44.175 --> 14:48.221
Say, sorry for shooting
your Muppets, man.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.931
They're not just...

14:50.307 --> 14:51.891
They're your co-stars.

14:54.185 --> 14:56.313
Is that you?
You all right there, Jim?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.231
Yes.

14:59.608 --> 15:00.609
No.

15:01.735 --> 15:05.322
I don't think the writers
on the 17th floor speak Muppet.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.657
They tied a belt
around Big Bird's neck...

15:07.824 --> 15:10.619
and hung him
from my dressing room door.

15:10.785 --> 15:13.163
Hey, I heard about Big Bird.
I'm so sorry.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.415
Autoerotic asphyxiation.
Who knew?

15:15.415 --> 15:17.751
You're full of baloney.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.419
- Uh-oh. Cursing.
-Consider me...

15:19.586 --> 15:21.588
the first rat
off this sinkin' ship!

15:21.755 --> 15:23.381
- Oh, really?
- Don't jump to...

15:23.381 --> 15:26.426
Oh, wow, that's mature. Well,
what can I say? Bon voyage.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.595
Lorne, he was our lighting
director. We need lights.

15:28.762 --> 15:29.846
I'm sure there's someone
else in the building...

15:30.013 --> 15:31.431
- who can push a button, Dick.
- Hey, he's the only one

15:31.598 --> 15:33.725
who knows the location
of the 200 lights you asked for.

15:34.851 --> 15:35.852
What is this?

15:36.895 --> 15:38.897
What's the meaning of this?
Who did this?

15:40.190 --> 15:42.025
Hey, I thought
we were making a comedy!

15:57.832 --> 16:01.086
Mmm...

16:01.086 --> 16:02.712
Sounding good, guys.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.049
Yeah. Okay.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.551
- All right.
- Say, uh...

16:08.718 --> 16:10.303
we actually
worked together before.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.889
I sang backup for Belafonte.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.184
Catch that?

16:17.686 --> 16:19.854
<i>♪ Drink the coconut water ♪</i>

16:20.021 --> 16:21.022
<i>♪ Four to five! ♪</i>

16:21.022 --> 16:22.941
<i>♪ Man, it's good
For you daughter... ♪</i>

16:23.108 --> 16:24.192
<i>♪ Four to five! ♪</i>

16:24.359 --> 16:26.653
<i>♪ Coco got a lotta iron ♪</i>

16:31.741 --> 16:33.368
The guy is singing, too.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.121
How many people
do they have playin' tonight?

16:36.705 --> 16:39.749
No. No, no. See, I am one of
the comedic performers, man.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.418
- Yeah, I'm in the cast.
- Uh-huh.

16:41.584 --> 16:44.546
You are a professional comedian?

16:45.171 --> 16:47.382
Uh... Well, uh... No, not...
Not... Not...

16:47.382 --> 16:48.967
- Not by trade.
- Okay.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.510
Uh... You see,
I'm actually a playwright.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.345
- All right.
- Perhaps you saw my work...

16:52.512 --> 16:55.432
at the Black Arts
Repertory Theatre in Harlem.

16:55.598 --> 16:57.100
Yeah, I must have missed that.

16:58.977 --> 17:01.396
Yeah. I actually don't know
why they hired me, man.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.066
Yeah, you seem a little tight.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.359
- A little...
- Do I?

17:06.526 --> 17:08.695
Yeah, you gotta kinda
loosen it up for the show.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.029
Say, Alvin...

17:10.196 --> 17:11.573
Hook Mr...

17:11.740 --> 17:13.575
- What's your name?
- Garrett Morris.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.869
Garrett Morris, y'all,
the comedian.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.537
Yeah,
hook Mr. Garrett Morris up...

17:18.037 --> 17:20.707
with a little bit of confidence.
You know what I'm saying?

17:22.083 --> 17:23.418
- Yeah, come...
- Okay.

17:23.585 --> 17:24.794
Go ahead and get it.

17:24.961 --> 17:25.962
Medical grade.

17:26.129 --> 17:28.465
Shit so light,
air at the bottom of the bottle.

17:28.631 --> 17:29.632
You're gonna float.

17:30.592 --> 17:31.593
Float?

17:32.010 --> 17:33.720
- I'm gonna put this away.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:33.887 --> 17:35.930
This is illegal.

17:37.015 --> 17:39.768
Yeah, well, you're gonna
need it. For your comedy.

17:39.934 --> 17:41.603
- Right. Right.
- Yeah.

17:42.771 --> 17:43.938
- Yeah. Yeah.
- All right.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.232
- All right, y'all, let's get it.
-Scotty, sound check.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.942
All right, everyone,
quiet for sound check.

17:48.109 --> 17:49.944
Sound check!

17:49.944 --> 17:50.987
This should be fun.

18:00.622 --> 18:02.332
Is this full volume?

18:02.665 --> 18:03.833
The whole enchilada.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.502
Sounds pretty adequate to me.

18:05.502 --> 18:06.795
Well, this isn't Wimbledon.

18:06.795 --> 18:09.130
It needs to feel like a rock
concert for everyone at home.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.257
Lorne has such
a deep appreciation for music.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.675
Shouldn't we have more mics?

18:12.842 --> 18:14.052
One band, one mic.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.932
Dick, this needs to be fixed
for tonight.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.517
That's what
I've been talking about.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.018
Three, four.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.486
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is this for John?

18:31.653 --> 18:32.779
Yeah, I heard he's in makeup.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.572
Do you like being yelled at
or something?

18:34.739 --> 18:35.782
Here, I've got you.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.201
Where are you going?

18:49.671 --> 18:52.590
Jimmy, do not bet
on that hand, please.

18:57.387 --> 18:58.805
Can you hold the door?

19:00.181 --> 19:01.474
Yeah, I think so.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.642
Ooh.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.769
- Easy on the macaroni, Carmine.
-All right.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.604
You don't want
to hurt your stomach.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.689
All right, Rosie.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.612
There he is...

19:14.779 --> 19:17.198
the star of the show.

19:17.365 --> 19:19.993
Come on, Rosie.
Not the fucking bees!

19:21.202 --> 19:23.913
I'm not a dashboard ornament.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.542
No, you're adorable,
is what you are...

19:28.001 --> 19:31.754
and all that fur, every girl's
gonna want to squeeze you.

19:32.463 --> 19:35.341
I am a trained professional.

19:36.009 --> 19:38.136
Well, you better watch
where you point that stinger.

19:38.636 --> 19:41.472
Come on. You want a little cig?

19:42.849 --> 19:46.394
What happened to my reporter
costume? Blaine Hotel?

19:46.561 --> 19:47.687
It's a five-second changeover

19:47.687 --> 19:49.188
from the reporter
to ancient Greece, okay?

19:49.355 --> 19:51.566
Lorne didn't think you'd
have time to get into your toga.

19:52.317 --> 19:53.318
Okay.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.533
Excuse me, ma'am.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.743
Don't be alarmed.

20:01.910 --> 20:05.288
You're dealing with
a fully-qualified male strumpet.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.832
Hey, Rosie, I got
the latest version of New Dad.

20:07.999 --> 20:09.000
Okay.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.668
Behave.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.420
Bee-have.

20:14.088 --> 20:16.466
I can assure you
professional hygiene...

20:17.175 --> 20:19.344
discretion,
animal gratification...

20:19.510 --> 20:20.511
Listen, strumpet...

20:20.678 --> 20:22.639
It's Fred Garvin.
Male prostitute.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.140
How much is this gonna cost me?

20:24.307 --> 20:25.975
Hey, need you in costumes.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.394
I told them to make those
hot pants extra hot.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.604
Yummy.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.940
Lorne, we're gonna go check out
the cut on New Dad,

20:31.940 --> 20:33.024
you want to see?

20:35.652 --> 20:38.321
Holy shit, holy shit.
Sorry, Lorne. Jesus.

20:38.529 --> 20:39.864
Hey, I heard John
doesn't like the bee costume.

20:39.864 --> 20:40.949
You know anything about this?

20:41.115 --> 20:42.951
It's not a costume problem.
He thinks he's Brando.

20:43.117 --> 20:44.202
- He's better than Brando.
- Lorne, Lorne.

20:44.202 --> 20:45.411
I'm working on it, Dick.

20:45.411 --> 20:47.413
He's better than Brando.
He's more important even.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.457
- He'll be studied.
- They will study his liver.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.459
John is better when he's angry.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.044
Rose, you understand
that in an hour,

20:53.044 --> 20:54.170
I owe a television program?

20:54.170 --> 20:55.296
I made a covenant
with the National...

20:55.296 --> 20:56.381
- Broadcasting Company.
- A covenant, huh?

20:56.381 --> 20:58.549
Yeah, a covenant, and I'm on
the hook for 90 minutes...

20:58.549 --> 21:00.551
- of live television.
- Okay, Abraham.

21:02.220 --> 21:05.556
Rose, must you turn him
into a bee?

21:05.723 --> 21:06.933
I am not turning him into a bee.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.017
Thanks, Tom.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.228
He is a man in a bee costume.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.688
- There is a difference.
- Hmm.

21:12.647 --> 21:14.691
It's an image
you can't get out of your head.

21:14.857 --> 21:18.611
It's postmodern,
it's Warhol, it's iconic.

21:18.611 --> 21:19.862
Mmm-hmm.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.197
Where do these ideas
even come from?

21:21.364 --> 21:23.992
I just send an imaginary dog
to fetch an imaginary stick.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.493
Yeah? Must be some dog.

21:25.660 --> 21:27.370
He's very well trained.

21:27.870 --> 21:28.955
<i>Honey, I'm home.</i>

21:29.122 --> 21:30.206
<i>Hey, pal.</i>

21:30.915 --> 21:32.542
<i>Hey.</i>

21:32.542 --> 21:33.626
<i>How are ya?</i>

21:33.626 --> 21:35.545
Looks like
Chevy's fiancée slipped and fell

21:35.545 --> 21:36.796
into another segment.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.090
Jacqueline's gonna be hosting
the show if you're not careful.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.299
Jesus Christ.

21:40.675 --> 21:42.301
<i>A wonderful family.</i>

21:42.468 --> 21:43.636
<i>Everything you need...</i>

21:43.636 --> 21:44.595
...<i>for the future.</i>

21:45.179 --> 21:46.556
- Danny's good in this.
- Yeah, he is.

21:46.723 --> 21:49.726
<i>What if you were suddenly
out of the picture?</i>

21:49.892 --> 21:51.686
Can we add sound there
over the X?

21:51.853 --> 21:54.188
-Like a buzzer?
- No, funny, like a bell.

21:54.355 --> 21:55.440
Good call.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.358
And if we could hold
on the photo

21:57.358 --> 21:58.651
for another eight frames.

21:58.651 --> 21:59.986
Um, 16 frames.

22:02.572 --> 22:03.781
Were you...

22:05.074 --> 22:07.201
thinking of going home
with him tonight?

22:07.827 --> 22:09.037
With Danny? Tonight?

22:09.454 --> 22:10.621
Yeah. I mean, I'm not suggesting
that you weren't gonna tell me.

22:10.621 --> 22:11.706
If you need alone time,
I can, I just...

22:11.706 --> 22:12.957
No, no, no. I just didn't know,
like, if you were...

22:12.957 --> 22:14.876
It's opening night.
So, I figured that it wasn't

22:14.876 --> 22:16.377
- the right time.
- I mean, neither did I.

22:16.544 --> 22:17.712
Well, then why are you asking?

22:17.879 --> 22:19.797
Just avoiding surprises, Rose.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.799
- But you love surprises.
- I love surprises.

22:21.966 --> 22:24.135
Like Anne Frank
loved her drum set.

22:24.135 --> 22:26.262
Don't encourage her.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.139
Can you hold on the photo

22:28.139 --> 22:29.348
for another eight frames, please?

22:29.515 --> 22:30.516
It's always eight frames.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.685
Eight frames is a beat. So...

22:34.771 --> 22:36.564
Can you believe I need to cut
an hour of the show?

22:36.731 --> 22:39.067
NBC doesn't want a three-hour
sketch comedy review?

22:39.233 --> 22:40.943
Jesus, Rose,
don't call it that, please.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.612
Well, what is it, then?

22:42.779 --> 22:44.030
<i>Honey, I'm home.</i>

22:44.197 --> 22:46.199
<i>Yes, it's New Dad.</i>

22:46.365 --> 22:47.825
I spent years collecting
orphaned comedians

22:47.825 --> 22:48.910
off the street.

22:49.077 --> 22:50.203
I know.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.246
They sleep on our dinette
and they whiz in our sink.

22:52.413 --> 22:53.581
By some miraculous accident...

22:53.748 --> 22:55.166
I found a place to call home

22:55.166 --> 22:56.667
for our little circus
of rejects,

22:56.667 --> 22:58.086
on national television.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.712
Rose, this is our shot.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.339
It's a shot.

23:01.506 --> 23:02.507
Rose...

23:05.009 --> 23:06.219
You're actually nervous.

23:10.973 --> 23:11.974
Oh, uh...

23:12.683 --> 23:14.519
Barbara was asking about, um...

23:15.144 --> 23:18.314
your credit... on the show.

23:18.481 --> 23:20.316
I figured
you'd go with Michaels.

23:20.483 --> 23:21.692
Is that what you want?

23:24.028 --> 23:26.864
I mean, you know, we're married
and you're my wife.

23:27.031 --> 23:29.367
I figured
it's the straightest line.

23:29.534 --> 23:31.452
Lorne, we're married,
but I'm not your wife.

23:31.619 --> 23:33.704
Yeah, I don't think
that'll fit on a crawl.

23:33.871 --> 23:35.373
Well, what would you prefer?

23:39.043 --> 23:40.378
Lorne, Lorne, NBC execs

23:40.378 --> 23:41.796
are waiting
in the green room for you.

23:42.004 --> 23:43.881
- Fuck.
- VTR needed this yesterday.

23:44.048 --> 23:45.216
Well, it looks great.

23:47.426 --> 23:50.012
- Tom, Al, what's this about?
-Hey, Lorne.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.140
- A last-minute piece.
- Just in case you need it.

23:52.306 --> 23:53.432
I don't. What's the gag?

23:53.599 --> 23:55.893
We're gonna dress Aykroyd up
as Julia Childs.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.520
- America's favorite chef.
- Okay.

23:57.687 --> 23:59.647
And right as she's carvin' up
a turkey on live television...

23:59.814 --> 24:01.858
She slices open an artery.
Blood everywhere.

24:02.024 --> 24:03.192
Everywhere.

24:04.944 --> 24:05.945
That's the whole pitch?

24:06.112 --> 24:07.113
Yeah, just America's
favorite chef

24:07.113 --> 24:08.197
painting the walls
with her insides.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.282
Total gore fest.

24:09.282 --> 24:10.658
It's gonna be utter carnage, boss.

24:10.658 --> 24:12.660
Oh, no, I'm Julia Childs

24:12.660 --> 24:14.871
and I've cut the dickens
out of my finger.

24:14.871 --> 24:16.122
- Sounds promising.
- Wait, wait, boss.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.248
I didn't even get
to the good part yet.

24:17.248 --> 24:18.332
Just put down a tarp.

24:18.332 --> 24:19.876
Yeah, he doesn't like
the Julia Childs bit.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.294
Uh, George...

24:23.421 --> 24:25.381
- How's Carlin?
- Warming up the pipes.

24:25.381 --> 24:28.134
Okay, well, heard Belushi
hasn't signed his contract yet.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.427
Eh. Formality.

24:29.427 --> 24:31.679
Uh, yeah, well,
they're pretty formal here.

24:31.679 --> 24:34.056
Uh, speaking of, the folks in
standards are a little uneasy...

24:34.056 --> 24:35.183
about the parody commercial

24:35.183 --> 24:36.684
playing right before
the regular ads.

24:36.684 --> 24:38.519
I think they think the viewers
might be a little confused.

24:38.519 --> 24:40.521
One might argue that's
what makes it humorous, Dick.

24:40.521 --> 24:41.898
Yeah, but, Lorne,
at what point are we

24:41.898 --> 24:43.232
not just making fun
of the audience?

24:43.232 --> 24:45.067
Hardly. It's commedia dell'arte.
If anything,

24:45.067 --> 24:47.153
it'll make the other commercials
feel all the more real...

24:47.320 --> 24:49.071
and the sponsors
will probably thank you.

24:49.614 --> 24:50.740
Who's in there?
Should I be concerned?

24:50.907 --> 24:52.533
No. Just try not to use words

24:52.533 --> 24:54.243
like "underground"
or "revolutionary."

24:54.410 --> 24:55.494
I'm not exactly Che Guevara.

24:55.661 --> 24:56.662
Yeah.

24:58.414 --> 24:59.874
What the fuck? There's like
a thousand people in there.

25:00.041 --> 25:02.293
Fifty. The affiliates,
from across the country.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.544
Lorne, they're excited
to see the show.

25:03.711 --> 25:04.795
I don't have time for this,
Dick.

25:04.962 --> 25:06.631
Lorne, these are the people
that will decide

25:06.631 --> 25:08.174
whether or not we have a hit.

25:08.341 --> 25:11.135
They choose whether we go
on the air. We need them.

25:13.804 --> 25:15.389
- Three minutes?
- Tops.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.185
Gentlemen. Hello.
Lorne Michaels.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.686
Hi. Lorne Michaels.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.147
Hi. Lorne Michaels.
Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

25:23.314 --> 25:25.066
Lorne Michaels. This is my show.

25:25.233 --> 25:27.610
Hi, where are we flying in from,
gentlemen? Chicago and...

25:27.777 --> 25:29.737
- New Orleans.
- New Orleans? Wow. Fantastic.

25:29.904 --> 25:32.365
Well, we're very lucky
to have some Southerners here.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.783
Hi. Nice to meet you.

25:33.950 --> 25:36.827
Hi, gentlemen. Lorne Michaels.
I'm the creator of the show.

25:36.994 --> 25:39.038
Hi. Wow. Firm handshake. Hi.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.624
I appreciate your support,
gentlemen. Thank you. Hello. Hi.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.542
-Tallahassee.
- Tallahassee? Wow.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.378
- Ladies and gentlemen.
- Hi.

25:46.879 --> 25:47.880
Who am I kidding? Gentlemen...

25:50.675 --> 25:51.801
Can I see that?

25:52.510 --> 25:53.511
Thank you.

25:54.679 --> 25:55.846
Hope this isn't the only thing

25:55.846 --> 25:57.515
getting sucked
on this weekend, boys.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.893
Jesus, you guys look like
the cast of <i>Godfather</i>

26:00.893 --> 26:02.603
if it was shot in Alabama.

26:04.438 --> 26:06.315
I see some cowboys here.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.234
That's a hell
of a 10-gallon hat.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.236
You look like you're ready
for a date with a livestock.

26:12.947 --> 26:14.407
Welcome to New York.

26:14.573 --> 26:15.741
It's quite diverse.

26:16.075 --> 26:17.451
If you want to meet
Black people, go to Harlem.

26:17.618 --> 26:19.662
If you want to meet Jews,
come to our writer's room.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.499
Sir, you look like
you're from Ohio.

26:23.666 --> 26:26.335
My favorite thing about Ohio...

26:29.046 --> 26:30.589
Let me introduce you
to our head writer...

26:31.382 --> 26:34.218
our prince of darkness,
Michael O'Donoghue.

26:35.011 --> 26:37.054
Thank you. Thank you, Chevy.

26:37.054 --> 26:39.807
Um, I'm certain
you all know Mr. Rogers.

26:39.974 --> 26:42.184
Perhaps the most kind
and gentle man

26:42.184 --> 26:43.394
in all of television.

26:43.561 --> 26:47.064
This is my impression
of Mr. Rogers...

26:47.231 --> 26:50.401
plunging 18-inch
steel sewing needles...

26:50.568 --> 26:51.569
into his eyes.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.792
Okay. Okay. Thank you, Michael.

27:06.792 --> 27:07.835
Um...

27:08.127 --> 27:10.296
Well, now you know
why they put us on at midnight.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.339
Um...

27:13.883 --> 27:15.760
Uh, hello, everybody,
my name is Lorne Michaels.

27:15.926 --> 27:19.722
I'm the producer
and creator of <i>Saturday Night.</i>

27:21.682 --> 27:23.392
We have a wonderful show
for you this evening.

27:23.559 --> 27:26.645
George Carlin,
the great Billy Preston...

27:27.772 --> 27:28.898
a film by Albert Brooks.

27:29.357 --> 27:31.525
Jim Henson's Muppets.

27:32.526 --> 27:35.154
We're, uh, excited for tonight.

27:35.738 --> 27:36.947
Uh...

27:36.947 --> 27:39.325
Because there's never been
a television show...

27:39.492 --> 27:42.703
made for or by the generation...

27:42.870 --> 27:45.664
that grew up
watching television. So...

27:48.834 --> 27:52.588
In the words
of my dear friend Che Guevara...

27:53.089 --> 27:54.965
this is the revolution.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.050
Yes. Yes.

27:57.593 --> 27:58.803
Who's with us?

27:58.969 --> 28:00.304
Heads on pikes!

28:00.971 --> 28:03.557
Blood will run in the streets!

28:05.059 --> 28:06.352
Gentlemen, behold...

28:06.977 --> 28:08.145
if you listen closely,
you can hear...

28:08.312 --> 28:10.689
Buffalo Bob shuckin' the cob
with Howdy Doody.

28:10.856 --> 28:11.941
Lorne can get
a little passionate.

28:11.941 --> 28:13.401
And so can Chevy.

28:13.776 --> 28:14.902
- Blood in the streets?
- Yeah.

28:15.069 --> 28:16.737
- Well, that sounds delightful.
- Mmm-hmm

28:16.904 --> 28:19.240
How much are we spending
on this insurrection?

28:19.240 --> 28:21.492
Uh, about 250 an episode.

28:21.659 --> 28:23.702
Well, I guess
revolutions aren't cheap.

28:23.702 --> 28:24.787
Right.

28:24.954 --> 28:27.373
What is this?
Absolutely not.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.542
No. No, no, no. We're not
gonna beg for their approval.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.668
No, take it down,
we don't need this.

28:30.668 --> 28:31.752
Well, you know...

28:31.752 --> 28:33.295
Lorne Michaels is
a special bird, you know.

28:33.295 --> 28:34.380
He believes in his vision.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.799
Well, that's nice.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.551
Mmm...

28:39.969 --> 28:41.387
And he doesn't really bend.

28:43.180 --> 28:45.349
We know how that story goes.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.352
Mmm-hmm.

28:49.645 --> 28:51.772
Des Moines.
How'd you escape?

28:51.939 --> 28:53.691
Well, I appreciate
you saying that.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.694
My father had good taste
and my mom was an alcoholic.

28:56.861 --> 29:00.448
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Can I borrow him for a moment?

29:00.865 --> 29:02.324
Enjoy the show, gentlemen.

29:03.451 --> 29:05.035
You held that room like a pro.

29:05.035 --> 29:07.079
-  Thank you.
- I mean it.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.540
I'm Dave Tebet, head of talent.

29:09.707 --> 29:11.750
You know,
I handle <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

29:12.084 --> 29:13.335
I didn't know that.

29:14.295 --> 29:15.296
Between us...

29:15.463 --> 29:17.756
Johnny Carson isn't gonna
be around forever.

29:19.341 --> 29:20.509
Think about it.

29:22.303 --> 29:24.472
You're a handsome,
funny gentile.

29:26.557 --> 29:27.892
That means something.

29:40.070 --> 29:42.323
Uh, Lorne,
you remember Dave Tebet.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.116
Oh, of course.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.451
I remember everyone
who gives me a job, Dick.

29:45.618 --> 29:46.785
Smart kid.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.496
Quite a lineup this evening.

29:48.662 --> 29:50.206
You know, while I have you,
I do understand

29:50.206 --> 29:51.624
that we are bending
some of the rules...

29:51.790 --> 29:54.084
Lorne, this is NBC.
There is a way things are done.

29:54.251 --> 29:55.628
- The Peacock way.
- Right.

29:55.794 --> 29:56.837
Well, we are thinking
a little differently.

29:56.837 --> 29:57.922
We just, you know...

29:57.922 --> 29:59.256
You know, maybe an emu.

29:59.256 --> 30:00.382
Hey, that's... Well, I just...

30:00.549 --> 30:01.592
Dick, shut the fuck up.

30:03.385 --> 30:06.722
Can't you see talent when it's
standing inches from your face?

30:06.722 --> 30:08.349
-Mmm-hmm.
- What do you think he's gonna do?

30:08.516 --> 30:10.768
Embarrass us
with some half-assed,

30:10.768 --> 30:12.269
rat-fuck donkey show?

30:12.436 --> 30:14.021
Frankly, that's exactly
what I signed up for.

30:14.188 --> 30:15.898
- Michael.
- I expect you...

30:16.065 --> 30:19.610
to be an unbending force
of seismic disturbance.

30:19.985 --> 30:23.697
Light up that NBC switchboard
like a bomb went off.

30:23.697 --> 30:26.242
Well, I promise
not to play the music too loud.

30:26.242 --> 30:29.495
Oh, fuck that. This isn't
the Moose Jaw Jazz Festival.

30:29.662 --> 30:30.829
It's <i>Saturday</i> fucking Night.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.998
I want you
to be thunderous and deafening.

30:33.165 --> 30:35.960
If my ears don't bleed,
I'll be asking for a refund.

30:36.126 --> 30:37.920
Great. I mean,
I've always seen this

30:37.920 --> 30:39.046
as a collision that erupts...

30:39.213 --> 30:40.714
- from every screen in America.
- Yes. Yes.

30:40.881 --> 30:43.217
A prism that captures the light
of an emerging generation.

30:43.384 --> 30:45.511
Stop! Don't say another word.

30:45.678 --> 30:49.139
Don't question another instinct.

30:49.640 --> 30:50.975
- Ebersol?
- Yes?

30:51.850 --> 30:54.311
We're standing in the presence
of a prophet.

30:54.478 --> 30:55.479
Yeah, he certainly
talks like a...

30:55.646 --> 30:58.732
A man with a vision.

30:59.149 --> 31:01.318
And I want you
to take that vision...

31:01.819 --> 31:03.445
like a Sherman Tank...

31:03.612 --> 31:07.032
and plow through any fuck
that gets in your way.

31:07.199 --> 31:08.576
Even me.

31:09.910 --> 31:12.621
"Use emotion for the many
and reserve reason for the few."

31:13.038 --> 31:14.123
I like that.

31:14.707 --> 31:16.417
I'm putting it on my wall.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.005
Was that a Hitler quote?

31:21.005 --> 31:22.673
Atrocities aside,
the man was a wordsmith.

31:22.673 --> 31:24.174
You missed a call
from Johnny Carson.

31:24.174 --> 31:25.426
I picked up the phone
'cause it was ringing.

31:25.426 --> 31:26.510
What did you tell him?

31:26.510 --> 31:28.262
I told... I don't remember.
He hung up on me.

31:28.262 --> 31:29.680
Lorne, Lorne.
Is that a bunk bed?

31:29.680 --> 31:31.181
I did have
a UFO encounter experience once.

31:31.348 --> 31:32.349
Danny ordered it for his office.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.685
That's confidence. Can you find
me something to eat?

31:34.852 --> 31:36.937
Neil, why would
he order a bunk bed?

31:38.522 --> 31:39.898
Could you get that hippie shit
out of my face?

31:39.898 --> 31:41.442
And I am actually very strong.

31:41.442 --> 31:42.526
Thinking that
he can do the voice?

31:42.526 --> 31:44.278
- It's Aykroyd. Of course he can.
- It's Aykroyd.

31:44.278 --> 31:45.404
But that doesn't
necessarily mean anything.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.572
Hello, boys.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.365
- Hey, Mike. Are you nervous?
- Hey, Mike.

31:48.532 --> 31:50.284
- Nervous about what?
- Performing on live TV.

31:50.451 --> 31:51.660
I'd be shitting bricks.

31:51.827 --> 31:55.456
Television is merely a lava lamp
with slightly better audio.

31:56.123 --> 31:58.167
Colored beads
to fascinate the animal.

31:58.334 --> 31:59.960
I could do it
in a narcoleptic coma.

32:00.127 --> 32:02.129
Hello, Herb.
How's Update coming?

32:02.296 --> 32:04.715
South Vietnam has seized
and burned

32:04.715 --> 32:06.967
100,000 <i>Playboy</i> magazines.

32:07.134 --> 32:08.427
I'm still working
on the punch line.

32:09.845 --> 32:12.723
For miles, all anyone
could smell was roast bunny.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.686
That's the one. Grab it, boys.
We need that couch.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.022
- Rise and shine.
- Oh, God.

32:20.648 --> 32:22.191
- Coming through, coming through.
- Whoo! Okay.

32:23.651 --> 32:24.735
Oh, pages.

32:24.735 --> 32:25.819
- Watch your back.
-Coming through.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.821
Oh. Here we are.

32:29.865 --> 32:30.991
You all right there, Chev?

32:32.493 --> 32:33.702
Things are...

32:34.495 --> 32:35.829
kooper kippy, Herb.

32:36.497 --> 32:37.790
I think it just happened.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.125
Think I got
the old shoulder tap.

32:41.210 --> 32:42.419
- The what?
- You know...

32:43.087 --> 32:44.588
from the guys upstairs.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.258
What's gonna happen to me?
I mean, Herb...

32:49.510 --> 32:52.596
you've been around the block.
Where am I going from here?

32:52.763 --> 32:53.847
Well, I don't know, Chevy.

32:54.223 --> 32:55.891
I never got a shoulder tap.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.185
I just made a fortune...

32:58.352 --> 33:00.187
and won a few Emmys...

33:00.354 --> 33:01.522
and slept with Gloria Steinem.

33:01.980 --> 33:02.981
Two out of three ain't bad.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.316
Here we are.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.485
Oh, wow,
you're in so many scenes.

33:06.652 --> 33:10.197
Well... Yeah, but I'm always
everyone's kid sister.

33:10.364 --> 33:11.365
You're the hot one.

33:11.532 --> 33:13.117
I think Jane's the hot one.

33:13.283 --> 33:16.453
No, I'm the mom.
The still-fuckable mom.

33:18.205 --> 33:20.124
My instinct is that
the American people

33:20.124 --> 33:22.084
are gonna fall in love with you.

33:22.751 --> 33:26.338
You'll be obscenely overpaid
for pratfalls and cute jokes.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.549
You'll waste away
most of your life...

33:29.216 --> 33:31.009
with purchased company.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.220
And then eventually
you'll self-medicate...

33:33.387 --> 33:36.223
with booze and hookers
and heroin.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.809
I imagine you'll die alone.

33:39.810 --> 33:41.979
Falling out of a hotel room
window in Stockholm.

33:42.146 --> 33:43.147
Jesus.

33:44.022 --> 33:45.023
I can't wait.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.151
Well, you're
everyone's favorite, Gilda.

33:47.443 --> 33:49.653
I'm just a bagel
looking for lox.

33:49.820 --> 33:52.740
I'm a parrot
with nothing to squawk.

33:52.906 --> 33:54.116
Well, I keep feeling
like any minute,

33:54.116 --> 33:56.076
Lorne's just gonna ship me back.

33:56.076 --> 33:58.912
Oh. No. On this budget,
we can't afford the postage.

33:59.079 --> 34:00.247
There's a reason
you're here.

34:00.247 --> 34:01.665
You may not know it,
but Lorne does.

34:01.665 --> 34:03.292
- Oh, God!
- You're dealing here with...

34:03.292 --> 34:04.793
a fully-qualified male strumpet.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.503
I'm not a prop, mister.

34:06.670 --> 34:08.839
You know, I can assure you
professional hygiene...

34:09.339 --> 34:12.092
discretion,
animal gratification.

34:12.259 --> 34:14.511
Why don't you assure me a little
peace and quiet?

34:14.678 --> 34:15.679
You rang?

34:15.846 --> 34:17.473
Yeah. I need the Muppet pages.

34:17.639 --> 34:18.891
I already turned in
that one script.

34:19.057 --> 34:20.267
Was Henson uncomfortable

34:20.267 --> 34:22.019
with the Muppets
on a plantation?

34:22.019 --> 34:23.103
It was a musical number.

34:23.103 --> 34:24.480
I don't think
that's the problem.

34:25.272 --> 34:27.649
I just can't write for those
little hairy facecloths.

34:27.816 --> 34:28.817
Well, I need something
for Henson.

34:28.817 --> 34:29.985
We go live in an hour.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.572
You cannot
say "horny" on NBC.

34:34.114 --> 34:35.824
Did you see
what that evangelical cunt

34:35.824 --> 34:37.117
did to our pages?

34:40.662 --> 34:41.955
I'll be right back.

34:42.122 --> 34:44.124
So you want us to say sexy
instead of horny?

34:44.291 --> 34:45.584
And sexy and horny
just don't mean the same thing.

34:45.751 --> 34:47.669
I struggle
to see the difference.

34:47.836 --> 34:50.047
Well, if a dog is humping
your leg, it's horny.

34:50.214 --> 34:51.340
It's certainly not sexy.

34:51.507 --> 34:53.091
What on earth are you doing?

34:54.718 --> 34:57.846
I'd rather butt-fuck cancer
than make these changes.

35:06.355 --> 35:09.107
Your words don't scare me,
Mr. O'Donoghue.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.401
I am a woman of God.

35:11.568 --> 35:14.363
I'd heard that God's love
is blind. Now I know why.

35:14.363 --> 35:16.031
You see this?

35:16.240 --> 35:17.241
I do.

35:17.407 --> 35:20.244
I know it looks like
an ordinary red marker...

35:20.410 --> 35:22.204
but this one is special.

35:22.371 --> 35:25.499
It has kept America safe
for the better part of a decade.

35:25.666 --> 35:26.667
It is a weapon...

35:26.834 --> 35:29.670
against vulgarity, sex...

35:29.837 --> 35:33.131
communism, and hedonism.

35:33.340 --> 35:37.594
Oh. What about violence? Does it
protect America from violence?

35:37.761 --> 35:38.804
Yes, that too.

35:38.971 --> 35:40.514
How about infanticide?

35:41.139 --> 35:42.140
Excuse me?

35:42.307 --> 35:43.725
Apologies. Just a...

35:44.142 --> 35:46.770
$2 word for a parent
who kills their own child.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.399
The mere thought
makes me nauseous.

35:50.399 --> 35:52.317
Oh, understandably.
Me too, by the way.

35:52.317 --> 35:53.819
It's just I had this idea
for a sketch,

35:53.819 --> 35:54.945
and I'm not sure if it's funny.

35:54.945 --> 35:56.029
You can be the judge.

35:56.196 --> 35:57.322
It's about this...

35:57.865 --> 35:59.074
powerful, temperamental guy

35:59.074 --> 36:00.951
who rapes this virgin
in the middle of the night.

36:00.951 --> 36:02.119
I know, awful.

36:02.286 --> 36:04.329
Knocks her up
without ever saying "Hello..."

36:04.496 --> 36:05.873
buying her flowers, whatever.

36:05.873 --> 36:07.416
And then...

36:07.583 --> 36:08.750
here's the funny part.

36:09.251 --> 36:10.836
He has their bastard son...

36:11.003 --> 36:13.797
publicly mutilated and tortured
to death on a cross.

36:16.133 --> 36:18.218
You are a vile human.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.429
Ah, fuck.
You've heard this before.

36:22.639 --> 36:23.640
Mr. O'Donoghue.

36:23.807 --> 36:26.476
Are we still being formal?
Please, just call me Satan.

36:26.476 --> 36:27.561
No, I am Satan.

36:28.103 --> 36:29.521
- I am Satan.
- I am Satan.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.898
- I am Satan.
- I'm Satan.

36:31.064 --> 36:32.441
-No. I am Satan.
-We're Satan.

36:32.608 --> 36:36.904
You will be forgotten.
I am gonna make sure of it.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.822
Bye.

36:41.450 --> 36:42.659
Are you out of your mind?

36:42.659 --> 36:44.161
Look, for better or worse,
I call it like I see it.

36:44.161 --> 36:45.287
Well, that was worse.

36:45.287 --> 36:46.538
Lorne, they need you
at the loading dock.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.623
I'm sure someone can sign
for whatever.

36:47.623 --> 36:48.707
You're back on the Muppets.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.208
-Fuck you, I'll quit.
- Yeah, I doubt that.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.376
It's Leo. He's been fighting

36:51.376 --> 36:52.669
with security,
and there's blood.

36:53.211 --> 36:54.630
Oh, my God. Dick.

36:55.047 --> 36:56.048
Oh, shit.

37:00.052 --> 37:00.886
Ah!

37:00.886 --> 37:03.096
- Hey!
- Hey, Dick. Is this turkey?

37:03.096 --> 37:04.723
-While I have...
- There wasn't a sign, so I...

37:04.723 --> 37:05.807
- Great.
- Lorne, Lorne.

37:05.807 --> 37:06.850
While I have you...

37:06.850 --> 37:09.102
Uh, I know you always want to be
on the cutting edge.

37:09.603 --> 37:10.604
Check this out.

37:11.188 --> 37:12.356
Polaroid.

37:14.524 --> 37:15.525
Okay.

37:16.693 --> 37:18.862
Uh, we can have the actors
demo it live.

37:19.029 --> 37:21.448
Write it into sketches,
do live commercials.

37:21.615 --> 37:23.033
Funny ones.
The payout is bonkers.

37:23.200 --> 37:24.993
Dick, the cast didn't sign up
to do live commercials.

37:25.202 --> 37:26.203
Neither did I.

37:26.370 --> 37:28.330
Some of the cast
might find that very unseemly.

37:28.330 --> 37:29.790
I completely understand.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.792
But television's driven
by advertising.

37:31.792 --> 37:33.251
It's what makes the motor run.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.586
It's really
not a big deal at all.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.254
Just please don't show this
to the talent.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.631
I don't want them thinking

37:37.631 --> 37:38.924
they're back
on the <i>Kraft Macaroni Hour.</i>

37:39.675 --> 37:41.593
You know, what, are we
going kayaking? What is this?

37:42.302 --> 37:43.595
Lorne, we're over budget.

37:44.221 --> 37:45.263
Dick, you don't need
to tell me that.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.682
Someone needs to tell you that.

37:46.682 --> 37:48.016
We don't even know
what the show is yet.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.559
How could we possibly know
the budget?

37:49.559 --> 37:50.644
That's true.
That's a good point.

37:50.644 --> 37:51.770
Neil, please.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.271
If we don't know
what the show is,

37:53.271 --> 37:54.815
Lorne, what the fuck
are we doing here?

37:54.982 --> 37:56.608
I know the ingredients.

37:57.401 --> 37:58.443
Just not the amounts.

37:58.443 --> 37:59.528
Lorne, what does that mean?

37:59.695 --> 38:01.405
We just have to make it
to 11:30.

38:01.405 --> 38:03.073
Hey!

38:03.073 --> 38:04.533
Ah!

38:04.533 --> 38:05.784
Fuck! You fascist.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.953
- You want to lose your job?
- You want to lose your teeth?

38:07.953 --> 38:09.663
I'm the producer
of NBC'S <i>Saturday Night</i>

38:09.663 --> 38:11.248
and you just hit a man
with a Tony.

38:11.248 --> 38:13.333
- I've hit plenty of Tony's.
- All right. Hey, that's enough.

38:13.750 --> 38:16.169
Tell your friends,
no deliveries after 6:00 p.m.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.255
-Shove it up your ass.
-Fuck you.

38:18.255 --> 38:19.715
All right.
Keep going with the bricks.

38:19.715 --> 38:21.425
You took that punch
like a champ.

38:21.425 --> 38:22.843
I'm actually not sure
you're supposed

38:22.843 --> 38:24.344
to be pinching
the bottom of the nostrils.

38:24.344 --> 38:25.429
If you pinch a little higher...

38:25.429 --> 38:28.515
Hey, guys, I'm so sorry.
Am I missing something?

38:28.682 --> 38:30.976
Why are we using real brick?
Can't we just roll out linoleum?

38:31.143 --> 38:33.854
- Hey! Fuck you!
- Okay. Jesus. Just relax.

38:33.854 --> 38:35.772
Dick, our vision for home base
is a street corner...

38:35.772 --> 38:37.733
with all the grit and texture
of New York City.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.901
Yeah, okay. I mean, are we gonna
use real blood and vomit, too?

38:39.901 --> 38:41.028
I'll give you
some real fucking blood.

38:41.028 --> 38:42.112
Hey, hey, whoa,
no more fighting.

38:42.112 --> 38:43.447
No more fighting.
He doesn't know.

38:43.447 --> 38:44.656
He doesn't know. It's okay.

38:46.992 --> 38:48.660
Why are we stopping?

38:54.499 --> 38:56.251
- Hello, everybody.
-Andy.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.170
What are you... You can't keep
wandering off like that.

38:58.170 --> 38:59.713
I had to go to the bathroom.

38:59.713 --> 39:00.964
That's very good.
That's very good.

39:00.964 --> 39:02.049
Lorne...

39:02.049 --> 39:03.050
Barbara,
what time do you have?

39:03.050 --> 39:04.634
Uh, 10:39.

39:04.801 --> 39:06.178
- Lorne.
-Hmm?

39:07.220 --> 39:08.221
The brick.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.681
It's...

39:14.519 --> 39:16.521
It's got its pockets out.
It's workmanlike.

39:16.688 --> 39:18.065
It's honest.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.900
Dick, it's critical
for the success of the show.

39:20.067 --> 39:22.110
Okay, but what is the show?

39:27.783 --> 39:29.785
I mean, honestly, Dick,
if you don't know by now...

39:32.120 --> 39:33.622
Chevy Chase.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.874
Gilda Radner.

39:36.333 --> 39:37.918
Dan Ayk-a...

39:38.085 --> 39:40.087

do you pronounce this?

39:40.253 --> 39:41.254

39:48.220 --> 39:50.138

39:50.305 --> 39:51.973

what it is you are doing here?

40:02.901 --> 40:04.778
Yeah, and I think
I've got a pretty good idea.

40:05.320 --> 40:06.321
And what is that?

40:06.905 --> 40:08.365
Well, Garrett, I'll tell ya,

40:08.365 --> 40:10.992
I like to give 100%
in everything I do.

40:12.077 --> 40:14.579
And I like a dish soap
that does that too.

40:15.831 --> 40:18.834

so alluring...

40:19.376 --> 40:22.003

40:22.462 --> 40:23.713
so manipulative...

40:24.047 --> 40:27.342
so sadistically abusive...

40:27.509 --> 40:29.594
so cartoonishly abhorrent...

40:30.095 --> 40:31.555
You see, when it comes
to my skin

40:31.555 --> 40:33.014
and my sensitive parts...

40:33.223 --> 40:36.476
I only trust
100% American-made steel wool.

40:36.476 --> 40:38.478
Strong enough for a man...

40:38.645 --> 40:41.523
but whimsical and helpless
enough for a woman.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.900
And don't wait. Act now.

40:44.317 --> 40:46.319

depends on it.

40:46.486 --> 40:48.196

40:48.363 --> 40:52.659

40:54.619 --> 40:56.538
Man, what the fuck

40:56.538 --> 40:58.456
- was all of that?
- That was my 20s, Garrett.

40:58.623 --> 41:00.584
And that is exactly
what I'm doing here.

41:01.001 --> 41:02.002
Well, shit...

41:02.169 --> 41:05.255
I'm just here
to play the butler...

41:05.589 --> 41:08.592
the shoeshine guy, and the pimp.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.303
Think you seem
a little nice for a pimp.

41:12.012 --> 41:14.055

Now we're getting it.

44:05.602 --> 44:08.188
You piece of shit.

44:08.188 --> 44:10.315
That was nice. Not bad.

44:16.279 --> 44:17.697
Caw! Caw!

44:17.989 --> 44:19.240
Don't shoot me.

44:22.827 --> 44:23.953
I know that noise.

44:25.038 --> 44:27.040
That's a monkey
being run over by the C-train.

44:28.708 --> 44:30.085
My archnemesis.

44:30.377 --> 44:31.503
Here he comes.

44:38.385 --> 44:40.053
There's no way
they're gonna fit all that show.

44:41.638 --> 44:42.639
You think?

44:43.848 --> 44:45.850
Yeah, something's got to go.
Hey, Lorne, can we talk minutes?

44:46.017 --> 44:47.060
You're doing great,
Billy.

44:47.227 --> 44:48.978
-That was weird.
- Yep. We're fucked.

45:00.156 --> 45:02.992
Excuse me, "ociffer,"
have I done somethin' wrong?

45:03.952 --> 45:05.787
What do we have here?

45:05.954 --> 45:08.373
Why, that would be my ass.

45:10.917 --> 45:13.753
Mmm-hmm. Billy Preston's band
hooked it up.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.505
Medical grade, baby.

45:15.672 --> 45:17.799
Floats in the bottle
and then you...

45:21.344 --> 45:22.345
Checks out.

45:22.971 --> 45:24.139
Medical grade.

45:25.014 --> 45:25.849
Uh...

45:25.849 --> 45:27.642
So, tell me how you fit
into this ensemble.

45:27.976 --> 45:29.436
Is this an ensemble?

45:29.436 --> 45:32.856
Uh, no, we have many talented,
talented improvisers...

45:33.022 --> 45:34.899
from Chicago and Toronto and...

45:35.066 --> 45:36.067
And Boston.

45:36.234 --> 45:38.403
And Boston.
Yes, Jane Curtin is from Boston.

45:38.570 --> 45:39.571
You've met my fiancée?

45:40.196 --> 45:41.197
Missed a little there.

45:42.365 --> 45:43.491
But to answer your question...

45:43.658 --> 45:44.617
While I've got you captive.

45:44.617 --> 45:45.702
They want to shave me.

45:45.869 --> 45:47.704
Careful. There's no jaw
under that beard,

45:47.871 --> 45:48.955
just 10 pounds of neck.

45:49.122 --> 45:50.290
Chevy.

45:51.958 --> 45:55.003
Jesus Christ, you psycho,
you son of a bitch!

45:55.378 --> 45:57.088
Shove it up
your fucking ass!

45:58.506 --> 46:00.758
Hey, hey, hey, stop right now!

46:01.634 --> 46:04.846
Guys! Goddamn it!
Stop! Stop! Chevy, out!

46:05.013 --> 46:06.973
- Don't feed coke to the animals!
-Out! Chev!

46:08.308 --> 46:10.185
Take a seat.

46:11.769 --> 46:12.770
Yeah.

46:12.937 --> 46:14.314
You okay, John?

46:14.481 --> 46:15.523
So, we're throwing things now?

46:15.690 --> 46:16.858
He started it.

46:17.317 --> 46:18.526
It's just a shave, John.

46:18.693 --> 46:20.195
So, NBC owns my fucking face?

46:20.361 --> 46:21.404
- No.
- Yeah, a little bit.

46:21.571 --> 46:23.281
But would Jimi Hendrix play
in mittens?

46:23.448 --> 46:24.616
That's a good point.

46:25.825 --> 46:28.077
John, you're going to go down
as one of the giants

46:28.077 --> 46:29.245
of character expressionism...

46:29.245 --> 46:30.788
from Chaplin to Brando.

46:30.955 --> 46:31.956
Belushi...

46:32.373 --> 46:33.374
Why hide your gift?

46:33.541 --> 46:35.001
Beards are for pussies.

46:36.419 --> 46:37.629
And the bees are bullshit.

46:37.795 --> 46:38.963
You think I don't know that?
Of course, they are.

46:39.130 --> 46:40.798
They're stupid,
they're postmodern...

46:40.965 --> 46:43.301
they're Warhol, they're iconic,
they're <i>Sergeant Pepper.</i>

46:43.468 --> 46:45.136
-So well said.
-I'm glad you get it.

46:46.304 --> 46:47.305
John...

46:47.472 --> 46:48.723
we go live in less than an hour.

46:48.890 --> 46:50.099
45 minutes.

46:54.020 --> 46:55.939
I need you
to sign your contract.

47:04.239 --> 47:05.490
Oh, yeah.

47:06.699 --> 47:07.784
What?

47:07.951 --> 47:08.952
What's happening?

47:09.369 --> 47:10.620
What happened to the music?

47:11.829 --> 47:13.581
Hey! Why did you stop playing?

47:13.748 --> 47:15.083
The speakers went out.

47:15.458 --> 47:16.459
- All of them?
- All of them.

47:16.626 --> 47:18.294
What the hell is happening?
What... Dick?

47:18.461 --> 47:20.338
I'm on with the outfit
that supplied speakers at...

47:20.505 --> 47:21.506
- Yeah, Rockefeller Plaza.
- Toscanini!

47:21.673 --> 47:23.841
Height of audio fidelity!
What can we be doing?

47:24.008 --> 47:25.343
Yeah,
what can we be doing?

47:25.510 --> 47:26.719
We got no sound.

47:26.886 --> 47:29.722
Idiot on the light board,
and we go live in 45.

47:30.139 --> 47:31.432
What do you want to rehearse?

47:32.559 --> 47:33.393
Uh...

47:34.477 --> 47:35.562
We could pull up...

47:35.562 --> 47:36.646
Weekend Update?

47:36.646 --> 47:38.314
Do you want
to do Weekend Update? Yeah.

47:38.314 --> 47:40.149
All right, everyone,
we're moving to Weekend Update.

47:40.316 --> 47:42.652
- Okay, great, great.
- Don, stand by for your intro.

47:44.237 --> 47:45.989
Here we go. Move it, people.

47:56.874 --> 47:58.001
Let's go. Let's go.

47:58.501 --> 47:59.502
I'm good. Fine.

48:03.006 --> 48:06.259
From <i>Saturday Night</i> News
headquarters.

48:06.426 --> 48:08.344
This is Weekend Update...

48:08.511 --> 48:10.471
with Lorne Michaels.

48:18.479 --> 48:19.981
Our top story tonight...

48:20.148 --> 48:21.190
<i>some world news.</i>

48:21.357 --> 48:23.568
<i>Japanese Emperor Hirohito
met Mickey Mouse</i>

48:23.568 --> 48:24.986
<i>at Disneyland this week.</i>

48:25.153 --> 48:28.239
<i>The emperor presented Mickey
with a Hirohito wristwatch.</i>

48:32.994 --> 48:34.078
How was that?

48:34.245 --> 48:35.330
It was horrible.

48:36.289 --> 48:37.832
Right. Um...

48:39.542 --> 48:42.587
And now with a weather report...

48:42.754 --> 48:45.965
we turn it over
to meteorologist John Belushi.

48:46.132 --> 48:47.759
What's it looking like
out there, John?

48:47.925 --> 48:49.218
Thank you, Lorne.

48:49.218 --> 48:50.470
It's often said,

48:50.470 --> 48:53.681
"March comes in like a lion
and goes out like a lamb."

48:53.890 --> 48:56.434
But did you know March behaves
differently in other countries?

48:57.018 --> 48:58.311
<i>In Norway, for example,</i>

48:58.311 --> 49:01.230
<i>March comes in like a polar bear
and goes out like a walrus.</i>

49:01.648 --> 49:03.608
<i>Or consider
the Republic of South Africa...</i>

49:03.775 --> 49:05.234
<i>where March comes in like a lion</i>

49:05.234 --> 49:06.569
<i>and goes out
like a different lion.</i>

49:06.736 --> 49:08.154
Like one has a mane

49:08.154 --> 49:10.281
and the other
doesn't have a mane.

49:10.448 --> 49:13.242
And there's a country where
March hops in like a kangaroo...

49:13.409 --> 49:14.911
and stays a kangaroo
for a while.

49:15.078 --> 49:16.120
Australia.

49:16.287 --> 49:18.122
<i>Then for a couple of days,
it's sort of a cross between...</i>

49:18.289 --> 49:20.375
a frilled lizard
and a common house cat.

49:20.792 --> 49:23.211
Then it changes back
into a smaller kangaroo...

49:23.378 --> 49:25.505
and then it goes out
like a wild dingo!

49:25.755 --> 49:27.298
No, no,
and it's not Australia!

49:27.632 --> 49:29.634
You'd think it'd be Australia,
but it's not!

49:29.801 --> 49:30.927
Oh!

49:30.927 --> 49:32.845
And there are
nine different countries...

49:32.845 --> 49:34.472
where March comes in like a frog

49:34.472 --> 49:36.349
and goes out
like a golden retriever.

49:36.349 --> 49:38.142
But that's not the weird part.
No, no, no.

49:38.309 --> 49:40.478
The weird part is the frog.
The frog.

49:40.645 --> 49:41.771
The weird part is the...

49:43.314 --> 49:46.693
Okay.

49:47.777 --> 49:48.861
John.

49:50.238 --> 49:51.948
Are you all right? Are you okay?

49:52.365 --> 49:53.366
I give in.

49:53.866 --> 49:54.867
That was brilliant.

49:55.034 --> 49:57.078
Now I need you
to sign your contract.

50:00.623 --> 50:01.958
- Was that a yes?
- That was a yes.

50:02.125 --> 50:03.668
- Was that a yes? Okay.
- That was a yes.

50:03.835 --> 50:05.128
- Neil, can I get the contract?
-Yeah.

50:06.003 --> 50:08.047
- Okay. Do you have a pen?
-Uh...

50:08.047 --> 50:09.173
Lorne, Lorne, Lorne,

50:09.173 --> 50:11.175
there's a call from Burbank
waiting in your office.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.219
Burbank?

50:13.386 --> 50:14.387
Carson.

50:14.721 --> 50:16.597
Uh, okay.
Um, Someone get him a pen.

50:16.764 --> 50:18.182
Don't let him use it as a straw.

50:18.182 --> 50:21.144
Uh, rehearse something.
Anything.

50:21.310 --> 50:23.438
All right,
Bee Hospital stage left.

50:23.604 --> 50:25.148
Let's go. We're moving.
Here we go.

50:26.232 --> 50:27.859
- Great work, guys.
-Excuse me.

50:28.025 --> 50:29.986
Hey, Mr. Michaels.

50:29.986 --> 50:31.237
- Oh, Mr. Henson.
- Hey.

50:31.237 --> 50:33.531
I'm excited to see what you
and your merry band of creatures

50:33.531 --> 50:34.949
have in store for us tonight.

50:34.949 --> 50:37.452
Well, Lorne, we don't have
any script pages yet...

50:37.452 --> 50:40.246
so, the Muppets
are flyin' blind here.

50:40.246 --> 50:41.664
Well, this is the first
I'm hearing of it.

50:41.664 --> 50:42.957
Neil, Jim needs his pages.

50:42.957 --> 50:45.084
Thank you. Thank you.
And please, sorry, Lorne...

50:46.002 --> 50:48.045
can you please
remind your crew...

50:48.212 --> 50:51.841
not to leave the Muppets
in compromising positions?

50:53.301 --> 50:54.802
That doesn't sound like them.

50:55.178 --> 50:57.263
Well, they left a note.

50:58.014 --> 50:59.015
They didn't.

50:59.182 --> 51:00.183
They did.

51:00.767 --> 51:01.768
It said...

51:04.479 --> 51:06.647
"Fuck-Rags for rent."

51:07.690 --> 51:09.066
- Mmm...
- Okay?

51:09.233 --> 51:10.902
I know what that means, so...

51:11.944 --> 51:13.613
I'll talk to Michael.
Immediately.

51:13.780 --> 51:14.864
Thank you.

51:17.617 --> 51:18.618
All right. Thank you.

51:19.535 --> 51:20.745
Oh. Hey, Bernie.

51:20.745 --> 51:22.163
Oh, no, you're good.

51:28.044 --> 51:29.295
Hello, this is Lorne.

51:29.587 --> 51:31.923
<i>I was beginning to think
you didn't like me.</i>

51:32.089 --> 51:33.341
Of course not, Mr. Carson.

51:33.341 --> 51:35.134
You're the voice
of a generation.

51:35.301 --> 51:37.428
<i>I just wanted
to reach out and say,</i>

51:37.428 --> 51:38.638
<i>"Good luck tonight."</i>

51:38.805 --> 51:40.014
Oh, that's very kind.

51:40.181 --> 51:41.849
<i>And also, I suppose
I wanted to make sure...</i>

51:42.016 --> 51:44.852
<i>we don't end up
stepping on each other's dicks.</i>

51:45.019 --> 51:46.020
Right.

51:46.020 --> 51:47.271
<i>You know how
this all started, don't you?</i>

51:47.271 --> 51:48.356
Just sign it, John.

51:49.232 --> 51:50.441
Just sign it, John.

51:50.608 --> 51:52.151
With a kite and a key, I'm sure.

51:52.318 --> 51:53.820
<i>Don't be a dipshit
for a second, kid.</i>

51:54.320 --> 51:55.530
<i>I'm sure you've heard by now</i>

51:55.530 --> 51:57.532
<i>that Mommy and Daddy
are fighting...</i>

51:57.698 --> 52:00.451
<i>and that's why you got
the house to yourself tonight.</i>

52:00.451 --> 52:01.911
<i>Frankly, it's the only reason</i>

52:01.911 --> 52:04.664
<i>they ever greenlight
your little talent show.</i>

52:05.373 --> 52:07.333
<i>Look, these things
always go the same way.</i>

52:07.667 --> 52:09.919
<i>First, they try to fuck you,
and then they buy you dinner.</i>

52:10.461 --> 52:12.255
<i>I'm not opposed
to</i> Saturday Night...

52:12.255 --> 52:13.673
<i>even if it is
a dumping ground...</i>

52:13.673 --> 52:14.757
No. No.

52:14.757 --> 52:16.551
<i>...for the deadbeats
and bagheads.</i>

52:16.551 --> 52:17.468
Dick, no.

52:17.468 --> 52:18.386
<i>In the meantime, you get to...</i>

52:18.386 --> 52:19.720
<i>play dress-up
on national television.</i>

52:19.720 --> 52:20.847
Don't let him
hold the camera.

52:20.847 --> 52:21.931
<i>Good for you.</i>

52:22.348 --> 52:24.058
<i>So, here's some friendly advice.</i>

52:24.892 --> 52:26.185
<i>Enjoy your little show...</i>

52:26.352 --> 52:27.895
<i>but don't get too comfortable.</i>

52:28.563 --> 52:30.731
<i>You're a benchwarmer,
a stalking horse.</i>

52:30.898 --> 52:33.651
<i>It's my fucking network.
It's my fucking night.</i>

52:34.569 --> 52:35.945
<i>No hard feelings, though.</i>

52:36.112 --> 52:38.114
Fuck the bees
and fuck this show!

52:38.281 --> 52:39.866
John.
Hey, where are you going?

52:40.032 --> 52:41.409
I go where I'm kicked!

52:41.784 --> 52:43.744
<i>Heard you are
a halfway decent writer.</i>

52:44.662 --> 52:46.163
<i>Send me some samples sometime.</i>

52:46.330 --> 52:47.790
<i>We're always looking
for a bunch of 'em.</i>

52:49.750 --> 52:50.918
How'd the call go?

52:51.085 --> 52:52.420
Tremendous.
Thank you for asking.

52:52.587 --> 52:54.422
- Great.
- Belushi walked.

52:54.589 --> 52:56.465
- What? He quit?
- No, well, technically...

52:56.632 --> 52:58.426
he would need a fucking job
to quit! But, yes, he walked.

52:58.593 --> 53:00.052
We need to find him.
I'll take the eighth floor.

53:00.219 --> 53:01.637
- You take the ninth, okay?
- Uh. Oh...

53:02.013 --> 53:03.014
Okay.

53:03.681 --> 53:05.683
Uh, hey,
have you seen John Belushi?

53:05.683 --> 53:06.767
No.

53:08.352 --> 53:09.604
There's a reason
they call it master control.

53:09.770 --> 53:10.771
Sorry, Jim,
have you seen John Belushi?

53:10.938 --> 53:13.232
You want to hand the airwaves
over to that maniac?

53:13.399 --> 53:15.818
- Have you seen Belushi?
- I'm not an animal wrangler.

53:16.360 --> 53:17.361
Belushi? Belushi?

53:17.528 --> 53:18.696
- Belushi?
- Belushi?

53:18.863 --> 53:20.197
-Belushi?
- Belushi?

53:20.364 --> 53:23.075
Hey, have you guys
seen John Belushi? John?

53:28.331 --> 53:29.582
Hey, guys, sorry to bother you.

53:29.582 --> 53:31.417
Have you seen
John Belushi anywhere?

53:31.584 --> 53:34.086
Oh. Yeah, sure. He was
hangin' out with us yesterday.

53:34.086 --> 53:35.254
Right, Howard?

53:35.421 --> 53:36.923
No, sorry. I meant
in the last few minutes.

53:37.089 --> 53:38.257
- Did he...
- Oh, no.

53:39.467 --> 53:41.177
Well, you seem stressed.
You okay, buddy?

53:41.344 --> 53:43.262
- Yeah, I'm okay.
- You need a hit?

53:43.971 --> 53:46.974
Uh, oh! No, no, no, that's fine.
That's okay.

53:46.974 --> 53:48.017
Oh.

53:48.017 --> 53:49.185
I think it'd help.

53:50.561 --> 53:51.562
That makes sense.

53:54.273 --> 53:55.274
There we go.

53:58.110 --> 53:59.820
Oh, look at him.

53:59.987 --> 54:01.864
Attaboy.

54:02.031 --> 54:03.824
Good luck on your quest, <i>amigo.</i>

54:07.203 --> 54:09.080
Have you seen John Belushi?

54:09.789 --> 54:10.957
Have you guys seen John?

54:11.123 --> 54:13.626
Neil, who do you think I am?

54:14.335 --> 54:15.628
Human bumblebee.

54:15.795 --> 54:17.171
No, man. I am talking about...

54:17.338 --> 54:20.341
what is my identity on the show?

54:20.508 --> 54:21.926
Don't ask me that right now.

54:22.843 --> 54:25.221
I can't answer that right now.
Oh.

54:28.975 --> 54:31.227
- Oh.
- What the hell are you doing?

54:34.313 --> 54:36.232
Thank you.

54:39.860 --> 54:41.112
Has anybody seen John?

54:41.278 --> 54:43.280
- I'm John.
-I'm John.

54:43.447 --> 54:44.448
- No. No.
-I'm John.

54:44.615 --> 54:46.283
-  I'm John.
- No. No.

54:46.450 --> 54:48.202
- I'm John.
- I'm John.

54:48.369 --> 54:49.370
Hold this, please.

54:52.957 --> 54:54.041
One of them is mine.

54:54.041 --> 54:55.209
Hey, have you guys
seen John Belushi?

54:55.209 --> 54:56.919
Hey, you're... Kid, why are you
holding your face like that?

54:56.919 --> 54:58.504
- Why are you shouting?
- Sweetie, are you okay?

54:58.504 --> 55:01.632
I don't know.
I can hear my own blood.

55:02.550 --> 55:03.551
Am I gonna be okay?

55:03.718 --> 55:05.720
Don't ask her.
She's a nymph, not a nurse, kid.

55:05.886 --> 55:07.346
I know that!

55:07.847 --> 55:09.640
- Look, should I be worried?
- About Neil?

55:09.807 --> 55:11.142
No. Fuck Neil. About my act.

55:11.308 --> 55:13.352
I can't get a straight answer
out of Lorne.

55:13.519 --> 55:15.855
Billy, you're family.

55:17.189 --> 55:18.274
- Neil...
- Neil...

55:21.944 --> 55:23.571
<i>This week
on</i> The Rumpus Hour.

55:23.738 --> 55:25.114
<i>Tony Orlando and Dawn,</i>

55:25.114 --> 55:27.241
<i>Shields and Yarnell,
the Domingo Brothers...</i>

55:27.241 --> 55:29.869
<i>and your favorite juggling
barbershop quartet,</i>

55:29.869 --> 55:31.203
<i>Macho Quatro.</i>

55:31.203 --> 55:33.748
Lorne. You know Milton Berle?

55:33.914 --> 55:36.625
Absolutely. Big fan.
I grew up on your work.

55:36.792 --> 55:38.335
Who didn't?
Hear it's your big night.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.588
Planning on it.
How's it all coming?

55:41.297 --> 55:42.757
Just perfect.

55:42.923 --> 55:44.633
- You never hear that.
- You certainly don't.

55:45.885 --> 55:48.596
Yep. Being here must bring back
all kinds of memories, I'm sure.

55:48.763 --> 55:49.930
Sure, sure. Yeah.

55:50.097 --> 55:52.141
Used to call this
the RCA Radio Tower.

55:52.308 --> 55:53.934
Radio, that wonderful invention

55:53.934 --> 55:55.603
by which I could reach
a million people.

55:55.770 --> 55:57.521
Who fortunately
couldn't reach me.

55:57.688 --> 56:01.859
You know, Milt's TV show
once pulled a 97 share.

56:02.026 --> 56:06.322
97% of the American audience
was watching Uncle Miltie.

56:06.489 --> 56:08.491
Do you ever miss
being Mr. Television?

56:09.825 --> 56:11.243
What is he talking about?

56:11.410 --> 56:12.411
Lorne...

56:12.578 --> 56:14.955
Milton remains
one of the Peacock's

56:14.955 --> 56:16.582
most colorful feathers.

56:16.749 --> 56:18.375
- It's quite a feather.
- Of course, of course.

56:18.542 --> 56:20.586
And I'm looking forward
to hosting your show.

56:21.295 --> 56:23.089
Well, we'd be honored.

56:23.380 --> 56:25.091
I think there's still so many
decisions we'd have to make.

56:25.257 --> 56:26.383
I'm hearing episode five.

56:26.550 --> 56:29.637
The boys upstairs love it
and the affiliates ate it up.

56:29.804 --> 56:30.971
Well,
they're the real boss.

56:31.138 --> 56:32.932
Right.
Well, it is a late show.

56:32.932 --> 56:34.350
Are you suited for midnight?

56:34.809 --> 56:38.312
At 67,
I still feel like a 20-year-old.

56:38.479 --> 56:40.397
Unfortunately,
there's never one around.

56:40.397 --> 56:42.066
Your reputation
precedes you.

56:42.233 --> 56:44.944
Yeah, by about 11 inches.
Excuse me a second.

56:47.488 --> 56:49.156
Any sign of Belushi?

56:49.782 --> 56:50.825
John?

56:50.991 --> 56:52.409
I believe he's in wardrobe. Why?

56:52.576 --> 56:54.620
Legal is frantic
for his paperwork.

56:54.787 --> 56:55.913
That's strange.
I'll look into it.

56:56.080 --> 56:57.540
Lorne, I can only imagine...

56:57.706 --> 56:59.291
what must be running
through your mind.

56:59.458 --> 57:01.794
The thought,
no matter how improbable...

57:01.961 --> 57:03.629
that you might
not make it to air.

57:03.796 --> 57:05.631
- Hadn't even occurred to me.
- Really?

57:05.798 --> 57:08.843
I heard that you were having
some technical difficulties.

57:09.009 --> 57:10.010
None that I know of.

57:10.511 --> 57:11.512
What the fuck?

57:11.679 --> 57:12.763
I just heard that...

57:12.930 --> 57:14.515
your writers were stoned...

57:14.682 --> 57:16.684
your actors were physically
assaulting each other.

57:17.685 --> 57:18.769
The sound system was down.

57:18.936 --> 57:20.062
What the hell
is happening? What...

57:20.229 --> 57:21.564
And a fire broke out earlier.

57:24.900 --> 57:27.611
I've been doing this job
a long time. I've seen it all.

57:29.572 --> 57:31.782
I'm sure you have it
all under control.

57:33.367 --> 57:35.161
Minor issues, already addressed.

57:35.703 --> 57:36.704
That's reassuring.

57:36.871 --> 57:39.165
This whole conversation
is a soothing shower of relief.

57:39.331 --> 57:41.000
Hey, good, good. Look.

57:41.167 --> 57:43.586
If for some reason
you can't lock your script...

57:44.587 --> 57:47.423
or commit your cast
to legally binding contracts...

57:47.590 --> 57:48.841
rest assured...

57:49.341 --> 57:52.178
the country will be
happy to watch Johnny Carson.

57:53.554 --> 57:56.056
Well, we could always play
the tape of dress rehearsal.

57:56.223 --> 57:57.892
Worst-case scenario.

57:59.143 --> 58:00.561
That's not the worst case.

58:17.119 --> 58:19.163
Fuck me.
That's a lot of cards.

58:19.747 --> 58:21.874
Yeah. What's the fastest you can
do your set? Top to bottom.

58:22.041 --> 58:23.209
- Five minutes.
- Yeah, me too.

58:23.375 --> 58:24.835
- Could you do it in four?
- Probably.

58:25.002 --> 58:26.003
Yeah, me too.

58:27.796 --> 58:29.548
So, look,
they're gonna offer us three...

58:30.132 --> 58:31.717
but we got to draw the line
at four. All right?

58:32.468 --> 58:34.595
Okay. I want to do the show.

58:34.762 --> 58:36.555
Yeah, we're doing the show.
We just can't get jerked around.

58:36.722 --> 58:37.723
- That's all.
- But we're doing the show?

58:37.890 --> 58:39.350
Of course, we're doing the show.
We just got to be

58:39.350 --> 58:40.976
- in this together.
- Okay.

58:42.645 --> 58:43.771
<i>Neil, sweetie.</i>

58:43.938 --> 58:45.564
- Is everything okay in there?
-Hello?

58:45.731 --> 58:47.983
Special delivery for Neil Levy.
Flowers.

58:48.150 --> 58:49.401
- Candygram.
-What's with the convention?

58:49.568 --> 58:51.153
Neil, it's your mother.
Open the door!

58:51.320 --> 58:53.697
Don't say that. He's gonna
believe you if you say that.

58:53.864 --> 58:56.242
Hey, Neil. Buddy.
You freaking out in there?

58:56.408 --> 58:58.452
I took a hit
in the departure lounge.

58:58.619 --> 59:00.246
All right. Whose grass was it?

59:00.412 --> 59:01.830
One of the horn players.

59:01.997 --> 59:03.082
Oh, degenerates.

59:03.249 --> 59:04.917
That's a potent dragon
you're riding there, kid.

59:04.917 --> 59:06.627
What you smoked
was a sacred strain from...

59:06.627 --> 59:08.128
the Isaan plateau in Thailand,
I believe.

59:08.128 --> 59:09.213
The best plateau.

59:09.213 --> 59:10.297
Make no mistake about it,

59:10.297 --> 59:12.007
that stick's probably stronger
than a bull elephant.

59:12.007 --> 59:14.468
But, listen, we're all a little
freaked out so...

59:14.468 --> 59:15.594
-I'm freaked out.
- Why don't you come out...

59:15.594 --> 59:17.054
and we can check on your face...

59:17.054 --> 59:18.305
make sure it's not
inside out, okay?

59:18.305 --> 59:19.932
-Come on, Neil.
- Show us your face, Neil!

59:19.932 --> 59:21.308
Come on, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

59:21.308 --> 59:23.185
- Come on.
- Come on out, Neil.

59:24.478 --> 59:26.230
Oh, God!

59:26.897 --> 59:28.774
No. I'm just kidding. Look.
You're gonna be fine.

59:28.774 --> 59:30.109
We'll fix you up
with some amphetamines.

59:30.109 --> 59:31.193
You'll be fit as a flea.

59:31.193 --> 59:33.028
You might even like the stuff.
Cocaine.

59:33.028 --> 59:34.405
Robert Louis Stevenson
actually did

59:34.405 --> 59:35.572
some of his best writing
on the nose candy.

59:35.572 --> 59:37.408
- Oh, Bobby.
- Not a lot of people know that.

59:37.574 --> 59:38.742
Yeah, he was a big freak...

59:38.742 --> 59:39.827
- for the Peruvian Lady.
-Hey!

59:39.827 --> 59:40.911
We need everyone in togas!

59:40.911 --> 59:42.788
Everyone down
to the eighth floor now!

59:47.001 --> 59:48.335
I'm not in a toga!

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:05.144
Okay, okay.
But why are we yelling?

01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:10.107
Rocky, there's no way these
kids are gonna hit their marks.

01:00:10.274 --> 01:00:12.943
So you better be wide enough
to catch 'em all. We got that?

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.195
Hey, did Rosie tell you
what she wants for her credit?

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:17.489
Oh. Uh...

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:19.700
She was of two minds...

01:00:23.203 --> 01:00:24.830
What is this? Why are you
cueing up Carson? Who is that?

01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:26.915
I think that's Tony Curtis.

01:00:27.082 --> 01:00:29.335
That's pretty normal right
before a live show, right, Dave?

01:00:29.501 --> 01:00:31.462
Yeah. If anything goes wrong,
we bump to tape.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:32.755
- See?
- Right.

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:34.590
Lorne! Lorne.
We found a lighting director.

01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:35.924
Great. Go get him.

01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:37.634
No, he's lighting
a show right now.

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:39.011
This will take some massaging.

01:00:39.178 --> 01:00:40.179
We don't have...

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.098
What floor?

01:00:44.016 --> 01:00:46.518
It's down on the sixth floor.
Some variety show.

01:00:46.685 --> 01:00:48.562
- And he knows I'm coming?
- Uh...

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.232
- Say, Lorne. This a bad time?
-Perfect time, Garrett.

01:00:52.399 --> 01:00:53.901
Okay, I've been thinkin'.

01:00:54.068 --> 01:00:56.111
Why did you hire me?

01:00:56.278 --> 01:00:57.321
You were cheap.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:58.405
Really?

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.115
I'm being ironical, Garrett.

01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:01.950
The fuck?

01:01:06.205 --> 01:01:07.206
Hey, Garrett.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:08.832
What's wrong?

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:11.293
Nothin'. I'm just...

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:14.338
Just trying to figure out
exactly what it is

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:15.547
I am doing here.

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:16.965
Aw, what do you mean?

01:01:17.383 --> 01:01:18.634
You know...

01:01:18.801 --> 01:01:21.512
I just can't help but feeling
a little bit like an outsider.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:23.097
Because you're so much older?

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:24.264
What?

01:01:25.099 --> 01:01:27.267
I went to Juilliard.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:29.645
I've been on Broadway.
I'm a published playwright.

01:01:29.812 --> 01:01:33.399
Man, they got me buzzin' around
here in a goddamn bee suit...

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:35.442
and wavin' a gun around
like I'm some kind of hoodlum.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:37.653
These are not my strengths, man.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.780
I am being under-utilized...

01:01:39.947 --> 01:01:41.073
which makes me ponder...

01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.242
what am I doing here?

01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:45.244
You know how many operas
I've done?

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:47.079
- I have no idea, Garrett.
- Shit...

01:01:47.246 --> 01:01:48.747
while Danny and Laraine
were eatin' Froot Loops...

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:53.627
I was performing
<i>La Traviata</i> in Italian.

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:54.795
Ya dig?

01:01:54.962 --> 01:01:57.172
Of course, I dig, Garrett.

01:01:57.923 --> 01:01:58.757
But, uh...

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.219
no one is saying
you can't sing on the show.

01:02:02.386 --> 01:02:03.387
Right?

01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:11.186
Where's the <i>Rumpus</i> room?

01:02:11.353 --> 01:02:13.897
<i>♪ Down on the right ♪</i>

01:02:16.692 --> 01:02:18.277
Oh. Whoa. Pardon me.

01:02:26.118 --> 01:02:28.454
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-And three, two...

01:02:36.628 --> 01:02:40.215
And we...
Seven, eight, and blocking!

01:02:41.592 --> 01:02:44.678
Five, six... Uh-oh!

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:46.263
Smile!

01:03:31.767 --> 01:03:33.977
Hey! You little fucker.

01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:36.104
Get your head out of your ass.

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:39.191
Prep the cupcake lights
and bring up the glitter, Carl.

01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:41.109
Carl?

01:03:41.777 --> 01:03:42.903
I have a job offer.

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:45.989
Comes with no guarantees,
no perks, and no weekends.

01:03:47.533 --> 01:03:48.534
How's the pay?

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:51.537
That's the worst part.

01:03:56.083 --> 01:03:57.084
What the fuck?

01:03:57.251 --> 01:03:58.293
- When do you start?
-Right now.

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:01.380
Send me a postcard from
the gutter, you little shit.

01:04:13.225 --> 01:04:14.309
Rosie, you seen Jackie?

01:04:14.476 --> 01:04:15.852
No. Sorry.

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:17.563
Knock, knock.

01:04:18.105 --> 01:04:20.232
- Hi.
- Hi, stud. Can I see?

01:04:20.399 --> 01:04:21.775
Can you get Chevy
to do this one?

01:04:21.942 --> 01:04:23.986
No way. You look so sexy.

01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:26.446
Hey. These can't be
the right size.

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:28.782
Yeah, you're right. They should
be a little bit smaller.

01:04:29.700 --> 01:04:31.118
This feels like
it's a lot of leg.

01:04:31.285 --> 01:04:32.578
You kidding, hot stuff?

01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:33.912
You're gonna melt
every TV in America.

01:04:33.912 --> 01:04:35.038
-Oh, yeah?
- Uh, yeah.

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.748
You know, ma'am, you are dealing

01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:38.083
with a fully-qualified
male strumpet here.

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:39.167
Oh. Male?

01:04:39.167 --> 01:04:40.419
I've actually got
a work order...

01:04:40.419 --> 01:04:44.006
stating I should be
rogering you roundly right now!

01:04:44.172 --> 01:04:45.591
Hey,
have you guys seen John?

01:04:46.425 --> 01:04:48.885
No, I haven't seen him. Danny?

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.512
- Have you seen John?
- Yeah? John.

01:04:50.679 --> 01:04:53.599
Well, John's an anarchist
and an Illinois alpha male.

01:04:54.266 --> 01:04:55.350
What does that mean?

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:57.853
Oh. Uh, well,
see, boss, you and I,

01:04:57.853 --> 01:04:59.229
if we were
to enter this space...

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:01.231
we'd be like
15th century peasants

01:05:01.231 --> 01:05:02.357
walking into the Vatican...

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:04.067
but Belushi's
a whole other animal.

01:05:04.234 --> 01:05:05.986
He's a skeptic and a sinner.

01:05:06.153 --> 01:05:07.613
I'd give O'Houlihans a recce.

01:05:07.988 --> 01:05:09.615
- He's at the bar next door.
-Ah.

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:12.909
Um, Barbara's still asking
about your credit on the show.

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:14.119
Whatever you think.

01:05:14.286 --> 01:05:15.495
It's your name, Rose.

01:05:17.539 --> 01:05:18.665
Has he only gotten that far?

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:21.418
We'd like to help,
but we're rootin' for the guy.

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:23.211
Well, at least
your heart's in it.

01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:25.047
Hey, you seen Jacqueline,
my fiancée?

01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:26.882
No, I haven't seen shit!

01:05:27.633 --> 01:05:29.551
Ladies, have you seen Jackie?

01:05:29.718 --> 01:05:30.719
-No. Sorry.
-All right, change of plans.

01:05:30.886 --> 01:05:32.179
We're skippin' Ancient Greece

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:33.972
and we're movin'
into the break room.

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:35.265
Ladies, I need you
in your hard hats.

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:36.767
Okay? Right now. Come on.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:39.061
I don't want to change.

01:05:39.227 --> 01:05:40.812
Are we good? Is he all right?

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:42.689
Yeah. Yeah. Danny, I mean...

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:44.107
whatever's going on
between you and me

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:45.817
is the last thing
on his mind right now.

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:48.028
So the man doesn't wrestle
with the green-eyed monster?

01:05:48.195 --> 01:05:50.113
Hardly. I mean, look,
I've known Lorne

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:51.782
since I had toilet paper tits.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.242
One day, he just followed me
home from school

01:05:54.242 --> 01:05:56.036
- and I never shook him.
- Pretty sure

01:05:56.036 --> 01:05:57.746
- you can be arrested for that.
-Look out, Rosie!

01:05:57.746 --> 01:05:59.081
Sorry, Moose.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:01.208
Anyways, I don't know,

01:06:01.208 --> 01:06:03.877
Lorne lost his dad
when he was 14...

01:06:04.044 --> 01:06:05.629
and his mom sold everything...

01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:08.215
and so he spent a whole year
without furniture.

01:06:08.382 --> 01:06:09.966
So when I first met him,
I thought...

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:13.804
he's just a stray looking for
a spare piece of carpet...

01:06:14.513 --> 01:06:16.223
like, he wants to be
a part of my family...

01:06:16.390 --> 01:06:18.892
and I'm the kid sister
or something.

01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:21.645
But then, hormones.

01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:23.772
Turns out,
I'm not the kid sister...

01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:27.442
and so we start dating
and I think...

01:06:28.151 --> 01:06:30.987
"Okay, he wants to build
a family with me."

01:06:31.405 --> 01:06:33.699
And we get married,
we buy a house.

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:35.742
I mean, no ring.
I think those are pretty stupid.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:38.245
But linens and china.

01:06:39.621 --> 01:06:42.124
And then it turns out...

01:06:42.290 --> 01:06:44.626
I'm not the kid sister
or the wife.

01:06:45.252 --> 01:06:46.253
So who are ya?

01:06:46.712 --> 01:06:48.004
I'm the writer.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.215
All right,
rehearsal's moments away.

01:06:50.382 --> 01:06:51.717
And who's he?

01:06:51.883 --> 01:06:54.511
We take you now
to Ancient Greece.

01:06:54.511 --> 01:06:56.012
Not yet, Don.
It's the wrong sketch, buddy.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:57.472
Can I get you
behind the lockers?

01:06:57.639 --> 01:06:58.974
Yeah.

01:07:00.434 --> 01:07:01.977
And try sitting like men.

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:03.478
- Oh, yeah.
-Perfect.

01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:05.856
Okay. Hair and makeup, clear.

01:07:06.148 --> 01:07:07.274
Clearing.

01:07:07.441 --> 01:07:09.109
Please get the fuck out.
Thank you.

01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:11.445
Okay, and action!

01:07:13.238 --> 01:07:16.241
Now that you've mastered
all the technical know-how...

01:07:16.408 --> 01:07:19.578
I think it's time
we work on your sidewalk skills.

01:07:19.745 --> 01:07:20.871
All right.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:23.665
Daniel over here
has kindly offered...

01:07:23.832 --> 01:07:26.918
to aid us
in a live demonstration.

01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:28.754
Come on out, Danny.

01:07:29.921 --> 01:07:31.381
Danny, enter.

01:07:35.427 --> 01:07:37.429
No, you got
to take off the robe.

01:07:37.429 --> 01:07:39.222
I can lose it on the day.
I figured I'd rehearse with...

01:07:39.222 --> 01:07:41.141
No. You can lose
the robe right now.

01:07:47.355 --> 01:07:48.857
The shorts are too short.

01:07:50.484 --> 01:07:52.694
Now, when
a little piece-a heaven

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:55.363
- like Danny walks by...
- Now strut.

01:07:56.615 --> 01:07:58.074
- Here's how you make him feel...
- Right.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.284
...right at home.

01:08:00.243 --> 01:08:03.163
Voom, va-va voom! Va-va voom!

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:04.915
Show him how to do it, Gilda!

01:08:05.165 --> 01:08:06.291
- Yeah!
-Come on, Jane.

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:08.210
- Give it to him.
- All right.

01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:10.587
Hey, dreamboat.

01:08:11.129 --> 01:08:13.965
What's the matter? Why don't
you give me a little twirl?

01:08:14.132 --> 01:08:17.135
Show me
what you're workin' with.

01:08:20.597 --> 01:08:21.807
Okay,
give it to him, Laraine.

01:08:26.228 --> 01:08:28.855
Hey, stud muffins, want to
make bouncy bouncy?

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:31.399
Are we still doing the scene?
Or...

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:32.526
What are ya talkin' to her for?

01:08:32.526 --> 01:08:33.819
You're talkin' to me,
joy chunks.

01:08:33.819 --> 01:08:35.153
Stay in character, please.

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.072
- Hey.
-Come on, baby.

01:08:37.239 --> 01:08:39.032
Ya dropped somethin'.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:40.659
Whoa!

01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:43.161
Well, I guess
I should just pick this up.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.836
All right, all right. All right.

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:52.003
They are so cute

01:08:52.003 --> 01:08:53.547
- when they're mad!
- All right, thank you.

01:08:53.547 --> 01:08:54.881
Okay, cut.

01:08:57.384 --> 01:08:59.010
The shorts are too short.
I told ya.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:02.556
Here you go.
It was a great scene.

01:09:03.056 --> 01:09:04.057
- Yeah, strumpet.
- Thanks.

01:09:04.224 --> 01:09:05.892
All right,
and we're movin' on.

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:07.060
Great rehearsal. Here we go.

01:09:07.227 --> 01:09:09.896
We take you now
to Ancient Greece...

01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:11.439
as Alexander the Great...

01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:14.025
attends his ten-year
high school reunion.

01:09:14.192 --> 01:09:15.777
Hey, boys, have you seen Jackie?

01:09:17.362 --> 01:09:18.405
Gentlemen, you seen Jackie?

01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:23.201
Look at that.
My goodness.

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:24.786
Hey, hon.
They need us in Athens.

01:09:24.953 --> 01:09:26.037
Jesus, who's this guy?

01:09:26.204 --> 01:09:27.706
Chevy, Milton taped
a show here...

01:09:27.873 --> 01:09:30.208
- back in 1956, isn't that neat?
- Ooh!

01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:31.418
She's taken.

01:09:31.585 --> 01:09:33.461
What hours? I'll take
the rest of the evening.

01:09:33.628 --> 01:09:34.838
- Excuse me?
-He's kidding.

01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:36.089
Yeah, buddy, I'm kidding.

01:09:36.256 --> 01:09:37.257
Oh, that's cute.

01:09:37.424 --> 01:09:38.967
I remember
when you used to do comedy.

01:09:39.134 --> 01:09:40.552
Funny, 'cause I never
heard of you.

01:09:40.719 --> 01:09:42.345
That's probably the Alzheimer's.

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:44.639
What's the matter,
did you wander off

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.975
onto an actual TV set?

01:09:47.434 --> 01:09:48.560
Hey, darling, you're sitting

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.353
in front of the Ghost
of Television Past.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.521
This old man...

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:53.481
he used to be an institution.
Now he needs one.

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:57.235
If you want my comeback,
you're gonna have to scrape it

01:09:57.235 --> 01:09:59.070
off the back
of your mom's teeth.

01:09:59.237 --> 01:10:00.405
Jesus.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.241
You're gonna laugh at that?

01:10:03.241 --> 01:10:04.409
Listen, sweetheart.

01:10:04.576 --> 01:10:06.369
There's plenty more
where that came from.

01:10:07.829 --> 01:10:08.830
God.

01:10:10.457 --> 01:10:11.291
Oh.

01:10:11.875 --> 01:10:13.293
Do I have your attention?

01:10:19.215 --> 01:10:21.134
I have two stars
on the Walk of Fame.

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:22.761
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah. Who gives a shit?

01:10:22.761 --> 01:10:23.803
Hmm.

01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:25.013
I once held 97%...

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:27.599
of America's television
viewing audience.

01:10:29.893 --> 01:10:31.478
That's not
what they're gonna remember.

01:10:32.479 --> 01:10:34.689
They're gonna remember
Mr. Television.

01:10:35.649 --> 01:10:37.108
Their Uncle Miltie.

01:10:39.069 --> 01:10:40.362
Who the fuck are you, kid?

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:43.198
You're not a star.

01:10:45.075 --> 01:10:47.077
You're barely
in the fucking building.

01:10:50.580 --> 01:10:52.165
You're not even a swingin' dick.

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:56.795
Call me after he's done crying.

01:10:56.962 --> 01:10:59.339
Are you shitting me?

01:10:59.506 --> 01:11:01.091
Are you shitting me
with this costume?

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:02.258
Can you make a path?

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:03.969
There's an actual comedian
coming through.

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:05.595
Wow. Look at these columns.

01:11:05.762 --> 01:11:07.347
I feel transported. Oh!

01:11:07.931 --> 01:11:09.641
Hey, George. How can I help?

01:11:10.225 --> 01:11:12.185
So, what is this?

01:11:12.352 --> 01:11:14.896
Why am I dressed like a fuckin'
towel boy from Caesar's?

01:11:15.063 --> 01:11:17.399
Well, I believe you're
Alexander the Great at his...

01:11:17.565 --> 01:11:19.025
Ten-year high school reunion.

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:20.193
- Thank you, Don.
- Exactly.

01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:21.528
So, when Chevy asks
what you've been up to...

01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:22.946
your response is, "You know...

01:11:23.113 --> 01:11:25.615
"mostly conquering
the known universe."

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:28.493
Right.
And this is for television.

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:29.995
- Right.
- What's your concern, George?

01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:31.287
My real concern is
why I let my agent

01:11:31.287 --> 01:11:32.372
convince me to do your show.

01:11:32.372 --> 01:11:33.456
Do you need some help
with the script?

01:11:33.623 --> 01:11:35.291
I'd just love to know
where the humor is.

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.419
It's like a Spruce Goose.
It's a lot of wood, no lift off.

01:11:37.419 --> 01:11:38.545
Well, we can rewrite.
I mean, we have...

01:11:38.545 --> 01:11:39.629
Is that right?

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:40.797
- Jesus Christ.
- Great.

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:42.507
- We could find...
- No, no, no. George, I hear you.

01:11:42.507 --> 01:11:44.092
-We want to make it work.
- I think I understand

01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:45.927
the reason
you might be struggling.

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.013
You see, these are scenes.

01:11:48.179 --> 01:11:49.180
Well, sketches.

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:51.057
- They revolve around acting.
- Michael...

01:11:51.224 --> 01:11:52.225
And that must feel foreign

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:53.309
when you're
a ponytailed vulture...

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:55.145
feeding off the corpse
of Lenny Bruce.

01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:02.736
It's okay. He's right.
You're right.

01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:08.074
Because I wouldn't want
to make these skits

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.993
any worse
than they actually are.

01:12:10.452 --> 01:12:13.496
It's a great thing
no one will be watching.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:15.832
Enjoy your fucking
little circle jerk.

01:12:15.999 --> 01:12:17.959
- We already are.
-Oh, your mom's here?

01:12:22.047 --> 01:12:23.298
Well, he's in character.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:47.530
It's shit.

01:13:04.798 --> 01:13:06.132
Lorne, Lorne.

01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:07.967
Lorne.

01:13:08.635 --> 01:13:09.719
Lorne, great news.

01:13:09.886 --> 01:13:11.888
We figured it out. Ready?

01:13:17.477 --> 01:13:18.478
Ta-da.

01:13:19.187 --> 01:13:21.231
- We cut the toga sketch.
- Oh.

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.525
Even without Alexander,
we're still 30 over.

01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:25.777
Maybe we don't need
four musical performances?

01:13:25.944 --> 01:13:27.821
Or maybe we could trim
one of the Carlin monologues.

01:13:27.987 --> 01:13:28.988
Okay.

01:13:36.371 --> 01:13:37.956
What about now?
Are we under now?

01:13:39.124 --> 01:13:40.250
We can make it work.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.090
Hey, hey, Lorne, Lorne.

01:13:47.257 --> 01:13:50.510
Look, I know it's probably
a bad time and all, but, um...

01:13:51.469 --> 01:13:52.470
but Valri and I
have been talking...

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:53.555
Yeah.

01:13:53.555 --> 01:13:55.640
...and we can't accept anything
less than four minutes a piece.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.350
So, that's four minutes for me,
four minutes for Valri.

01:13:57.517 --> 01:13:58.726
Look, we've just been...

01:13:59.144 --> 01:14:00.603
working too hard on our material

01:14:00.603 --> 01:14:02.230
to accept
anything less so it's...

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:04.065
four minutes or nothin'.

01:14:04.315 --> 01:14:05.733
Well, I need two minutes.

01:14:06.109 --> 01:14:07.485
You need me
to cut two minutes of my sketch?

01:14:07.485 --> 01:14:08.570
I could do that, Lorne.

01:14:08.570 --> 01:14:10.113
I mean, that's six minutes only,
you know. I can make that...

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.573
No, I need two minutes
of material.

01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:13.408
It's two minutes or nothing.

01:14:13.825 --> 01:14:15.076
Is this for real? 'Cause...

01:14:15.827 --> 01:14:17.579
Okay, I killed at dress, right?

01:14:17.579 --> 01:14:18.997
I'm the only good act
that killed at dress.

01:14:18.997 --> 01:14:20.081
I can do the show, so...

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:21.374
Billy, can you make it work
in two minutes?

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:23.751
- I can't even set it up in two.
- Then I don't know what to say.

01:14:23.918 --> 01:14:25.086
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

01:14:25.545 --> 01:14:26.546
Can you make it in two?

01:14:27.547 --> 01:14:28.882
- Yes.
- Great.

01:14:36.598 --> 01:14:38.016
Lorne, Lorne.

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:39.767
Uh...

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:42.228
I was thinking...

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:44.147
why don't we punt?

01:14:46.149 --> 01:14:48.860
Come back stronger next week,
debut with Paul Simon.

01:14:49.277 --> 01:14:50.361
That's what
you've been thinking?

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:53.072
Listen, no one wants this show
to succeed more than I do.

01:14:53.239 --> 01:14:54.240
Is that so?

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:56.993
I mean, yeah,
I hired you, Lorne.

01:14:57.493 --> 01:14:58.912
I take it up the ass
from this network every day...

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:00.496
because I believe in this show.

01:15:00.663 --> 01:15:02.665
And I'm telling you, we should
run the dress rehearsal...

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:04.417
and claw back a win
next Saturday.

01:15:04.584 --> 01:15:05.960
It's in everyone's
best interest.

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.212
Mainly yours.

01:15:07.212 --> 01:15:08.588
Sorry. Was that a threat?

01:15:08.755 --> 01:15:10.590
No. What? No.

01:15:10.965 --> 01:15:13.218
Lorne, all I'm trying to do
is give you advice.

01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:14.552
25 minutes!

01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:17.555
Thanks for the advice,
but we can't, Dick.

01:15:17.555 --> 01:15:18.640
It's a live show.

01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.724
No one's gonna know
the difference.

01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:21.309
- We just can't.
- Lorne, you need to start

01:15:21.309 --> 01:15:23.311
adjusting your concept of what
you can and cannot do.

01:15:23.311 --> 01:15:24.896
We can't
because there is no tape.

01:15:25.063 --> 01:15:26.773
I didn't record
the dress rehearsal.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.150
So, we don't have
to argue about it.

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:31.527
You didn't what?

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.029
We just have to make it to air.

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:35.031
Lorne, I'm not gonna be able
to protect you.

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:37.659
- I'm used to that.
- Oh, screw you.

01:15:37.825 --> 01:15:40.203
Do you know how much bullshit
never makes it to your ears?

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:41.704
Because I'm the wall they hit.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.665
Tell that to your Polaroid rep.
She's cute.

01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:46.125
I'm sorry you need
a sponsor for a show

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:47.835
that can't pull
a single advertiser.

01:15:48.002 --> 01:15:49.754
You know they're giving out
the ads for free?

01:15:49.921 --> 01:15:53.258
NBC is lucky to have something
as relevant as this show.

01:15:53.258 --> 01:15:54.592
Lorne, they don't even want it.

01:15:54.592 --> 01:15:55.677
That's logical, Dick. That's why

01:15:55.677 --> 01:15:56.886
they're paying us all
to be here.

01:16:00.682 --> 01:16:02.183
They want you to fail.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.643
They're betting on it.

01:16:03.643 --> 01:16:04.769
Really?

01:16:04.769 --> 01:16:06.020
NBC makes more money

01:16:06.020 --> 01:16:07.981
playing reruns
of <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:10.316
- So, why don't they?
- It's a contract dispute, Lorne.

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:12.235
I mean, they're trying
to prove to Johnny Carson

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:13.820
that the reruns are inevitable.

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:17.031
So, they built a show
that was guaranteed to fail.

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:19.242
I mean, Lorne,
90 minutes of live television

01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:20.576
by a group of 20-year-olds...

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:21.911
who've never made anything.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:24.539
Do you ever stop and wonder
why they said yes?

01:16:24.706 --> 01:16:27.625
A counterculture show
starring total unknowns...

01:16:27.792 --> 01:16:30.253
with zero narrative
and even less structure?

01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:32.547
Are you that fucking arrogant...

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:35.091
that you never
even questioned this?

01:16:38.011 --> 01:16:39.554
Now, look, you want to know
what's gonna happen

01:16:39.554 --> 01:16:41.431
at 11:30 tonight? Okay.

01:16:42.015 --> 01:16:43.308
Your actors
will be on their marks.

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:45.226
Band's tuned up,
all ready to go.

01:16:45.393 --> 01:16:46.853
Joe will be hollering out
the countdown...

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:48.229
and you'll be
in the control room...

01:16:48.396 --> 01:16:50.690
and Dave Tebet will be standing
probably right next to you.

01:16:50.857 --> 01:16:52.317
And when
those screens go black...

01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:53.860
he will raise his big-ass,

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.486
jeweled-up index finger
and say...

01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:56.696
"Go to Carson."

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.406
And that will be that.

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:00.825
You blew it.

01:17:05.288 --> 01:17:07.749
And listen,
I know you all make fun of me...

01:17:07.915 --> 01:17:09.292
and my clothes behind my back.

01:17:10.168 --> 01:17:12.170
But, Lorne, I'm killing myself
for this show.

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:16.007
Also, Polaroid is cool.

01:17:36.527 --> 01:17:38.654
- Oh, shit! Lorne.
- It worked!

01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.453
Nice work, fellas.

01:17:46.704 --> 01:17:48.206
A little heavy on the flow,
but very funny.

01:17:49.332 --> 01:17:50.333
Sorry about the clothes.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:51.793
And your face.

01:17:53.711 --> 01:17:58.132
Art is but a measure
of sacrifice and tears.

01:17:59.634 --> 01:18:00.676
Not quite ready for tonight,

01:18:00.676 --> 01:18:02.512
but I'll keep it
on a special list.

01:18:04.305 --> 01:18:06.015
"Special list"?

01:18:19.904 --> 01:18:20.905
Lobby.

01:18:25.326 --> 01:18:26.994
This an okay time?

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:29.038
Ideal.

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:30.373
Look...

01:18:32.125 --> 01:18:33.584
I know what people say...

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:36.629
when they see a man
with his arm up a Muppet.

01:18:37.839 --> 01:18:38.673
But...

01:18:39.173 --> 01:18:41.509
this isn't just kid's stuff.

01:18:42.343 --> 01:18:44.220
I believe, deep in my heart...

01:18:44.387 --> 01:18:47.598
that there is room
for high-stakes puppetry...

01:18:47.765 --> 01:18:49.392
on grown-up TV.

01:18:49.642 --> 01:18:52.645
And... I get the sense that...

01:18:52.812 --> 01:18:54.981
some of the writers
on the 17th floor

01:18:54.981 --> 01:18:56.941
don't share that dream.

01:18:59.277 --> 01:19:01.028
You didn't like the pages?

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:05.616
There were no pages.

01:19:06.451 --> 01:19:08.870
That's fair criticism.

01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:12.290
Free show!

01:19:12.874 --> 01:19:14.000
Free show, sir?

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:15.793
Free show.

01:19:17.628 --> 01:19:19.714
Plenty of tickets left, guys.
Free show.

01:19:20.131 --> 01:19:21.466
The night's still young.

01:19:22.258 --> 01:19:23.342
Hey, man! How's it going?

01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:31.142
Thank you. Long Island.

01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:32.810
Massapequa Park.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:34.270
Hello?

01:20:04.967 --> 01:20:06.511
<i>My family had trouble
fittin' in</i>

01:20:06.511 --> 01:20:08.095
<i>when they got to America.</i>

01:20:08.262 --> 01:20:09.722
<i>Even though my great-grandfather</i>

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.974
<i>actually fought
in the Civil War...</i>

01:20:12.308 --> 01:20:14.227
<i>he fought for the West.</i>

01:20:14.227 --> 01:20:16.479
-  Jesus Christ.
-<i>Okay.</i>

01:20:16.646 --> 01:20:18.564
<i>This drunk,
he's in front of the bench.</i>

01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:21.025
<i>The judge says, "Hey, we brought
you in for drinking."</i>

01:20:21.192 --> 01:20:23.236
<i>And the drunk goes,
"Great. What are we havin'?"</i>

01:20:24.946 --> 01:20:28.366
That's not the punch line.
Jesus, fucking bullshit!

01:20:28.533 --> 01:20:29.784
What's happening here?

01:20:30.535 --> 01:20:33.955
I get paid seven bucks a joke,
if it gets a laugh. Which...

01:20:34.330 --> 01:20:35.998
This putz is taking
bulletproof material

01:20:35.998 --> 01:20:37.083
and filling it with lead.

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:38.292
You wrote his jokes?

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:40.419
Yeah. I wrote things
that vaguely resemble

01:20:40.419 --> 01:20:41.754
the things that he's saying.

01:20:42.463 --> 01:20:44.715
Why don't you just
perform them yourself?

01:20:45.383 --> 01:20:47.426
Look at me. This is how much
I sweat off-stage.

01:20:47.802 --> 01:20:49.595
<i>I get home from work
the other night...</i>

01:20:49.971 --> 01:20:52.557
<i>I see my wife in bed
with my best friend.</i>

01:20:52.723 --> 01:20:55.560
<i>I say to him, I go,
"I have to, but you?"</i>

01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:57.436
- Oh, my God.
- How many do you have in here?

01:20:57.603 --> 01:21:00.106
About 1,100.
They're single-spaced.

01:21:00.523 --> 01:21:01.857
Sorry, do you mind
if I go through them?

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:04.193
<i>- Bring up the next comedian!</i>
- Yeah. Go for it.

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:05.403
<i>I'm sure
you'll hate him, too.</i>

01:21:09.323 --> 01:21:10.324
Move.

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:16.372
God. That was fuckin' rough.
Shit crowd.

01:21:16.539 --> 01:21:17.873
Yeah, that was it.

01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:20.543
Hey, come on.
What's with the quarters?

01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:23.796
Well, I changed the punch line
from 46 to 49...

01:21:23.963 --> 01:21:25.798
for the line about the Buick.

01:21:25.965 --> 01:21:27.091
Much bigger laugh, by the way.

01:21:27.258 --> 01:21:29.510
So, that means
I only owe you $3.50.

01:21:29.677 --> 01:21:30.678
You want a job?

01:21:30.845 --> 01:21:31.971
That would be great.

01:21:32.138 --> 01:21:33.681
I want a length of rope
and a sturdy beam.

01:21:33.848 --> 01:21:35.766
How much do you need to live?

01:21:35.933 --> 01:21:38.144
I make three bucks an hour
at my day job. Match it.

01:21:38.311 --> 01:21:40.021
Tell him what you really do.
Tell him.

01:21:40.187 --> 01:21:41.439
He's a deli boy.

01:21:41.606 --> 01:21:44.191
Okay? He's a schmuck
in a little paper hat...

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:46.861
who slices the pastrami
behind the counter.

01:21:46.861 --> 01:21:48.404
And he can
barely do that.

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:49.697
Tell him what you did
to your finger.

01:21:49.947 --> 01:21:51.532
You're hired. Lorne Michaels.

01:21:51.699 --> 01:21:54.493
- Alan. Zweibel.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.037
You'd be better off
buying the pastrami.

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:57.204
Let's go.

01:21:57.371 --> 01:21:58.581
Wait, what? When do we start?

01:21:58.581 --> 01:22:00.916
Um... Jesus Christ.

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:04.503
You can't...
You better not leave.

01:22:05.004 --> 01:22:06.547
This is not
gonna be good for you.

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:08.633
I was gonna take you to Reno.

01:22:16.641 --> 01:22:18.017
Look at that form.

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:19.894
Beautiful.

01:22:31.030 --> 01:22:32.823
You ever have nostalgia
for a moment

01:22:32.823 --> 01:22:34.116
while you're still in it?

01:22:36.494 --> 01:22:38.245
I mean, like...

01:22:39.205 --> 01:22:41.248
You're in the moment,
but you're also...

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:43.709
looking back on it. Like...

01:22:44.794 --> 01:22:47.463
Right now, I'm here,
but I'm also...

01:22:47.963 --> 01:22:50.675
thinking about this moment
20 years from now.

01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:52.426
We're walking by this ice rink.

01:22:53.511 --> 01:22:54.762
Maybe it's Christmas...

01:22:54.929 --> 01:22:57.973
and our kids are draggin' us
by our pinkies...

01:22:58.432 --> 01:23:01.769
and we got presents loaded
on our shoulders...

01:23:02.687 --> 01:23:04.605
and all we can think about
is this moment,

01:23:04.605 --> 01:23:06.691
right before we went on TV.

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:15.408
You know,
the NBC liability act

01:23:15.408 --> 01:23:16.951
forbids you from ice skating.

01:23:18.285 --> 01:23:19.286
I found John.

01:23:19.453 --> 01:23:20.454
Oh,
excellent work, Gilda.

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:22.665
Good thing
I didn't sign my contract.

01:23:25.918 --> 01:23:27.128
What's the deal, John?

01:23:29.046 --> 01:23:30.297
You on the show or not?

01:23:35.219 --> 01:23:38.264
The one where I get to dress up
like a giant, grotesque bee?

01:23:39.140 --> 01:23:41.267
I don't know.
Let me ask my childhood dreams.

01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:48.023
I want to try a triple axel.

01:23:48.566 --> 01:23:50.192
Now we're talkin'.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:51.819
How about a single axel?

01:23:52.236 --> 01:23:53.237
Nah.

01:23:54.113 --> 01:23:56.407
I figure I can either pull off
the triple...

01:23:57.825 --> 01:23:58.909
or die trying.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:01.245
Those are the options?

01:24:10.129 --> 01:24:12.757
Okay, John. I... I...

01:24:12.757 --> 01:24:14.300
I support it.

01:24:21.682 --> 01:24:22.683
Oh, God.

01:24:34.862 --> 01:24:36.697
- He's gonna break something.
- Oh, God.

01:24:39.992 --> 01:24:41.076
- Oh, fuck!
- Shit. John!

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.161
John?

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:43.954
-John!
-Fuck!

01:24:44.121 --> 01:24:45.122
Are you okay?

01:24:49.710 --> 01:24:51.253
You all right? I yield.

01:24:52.588 --> 01:24:54.131
I accept your surrender.

01:24:54.298 --> 01:24:56.675
Do you want me to help you up?

01:24:56.842 --> 01:24:57.843
No.

01:24:58.928 --> 01:25:00.763
I'm just gonna lie here
for a minute.

01:25:02.431 --> 01:25:04.350
Okay, sure. Yeah.

01:25:05.142 --> 01:25:06.769
We have all the time
in the world.

01:25:12.024 --> 01:25:14.068
Who is that asshole, anyway?

01:25:15.319 --> 01:25:16.695
It's Prometheus.

01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:19.406
He stole fire
from the cauldron of the gods...

01:25:19.573 --> 01:25:22.535
gave it to man, so we could
have science and the arts.

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:28.040
All right.
I'm gonna head back up.

01:25:29.250 --> 01:25:30.960
We have a show to put on...

01:25:31.126 --> 01:25:33.087
and I'd like to be there
when I get fired.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.298
I'd hope to see you there,
too, John.

01:25:57.695 --> 01:25:58.737
- Hey!
-Hey.

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:00.739
Heard you needed a quick change
for the last act?

01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:01.907
Thank you.

01:26:09.582 --> 01:26:10.916
What should I say
when I get up there?

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:12.626
- How should I know?
- You're the writer.

01:26:12.793 --> 01:26:14.211
- You're the talker.
- I'm the talker?

01:26:14.378 --> 01:26:16.422
Yeah, you talk the peel
off a grape.

01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:18.507
That was funny.

01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:27.558
Rose, I won't be offended

01:26:27.558 --> 01:26:29.184
if you don't want to use
my last name.

01:26:29.935 --> 01:26:31.979
It's not your last name,
Lipowitz.

01:26:36.233 --> 01:26:37.276
Whoa!

01:26:37.276 --> 01:26:38.652
Check it out! Full house, right?

01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:39.820
What did you tell them?

01:26:39.987 --> 01:26:41.196
Well, I kind of
had to lie a little bit,

01:26:41.196 --> 01:26:42.281
but the vibes are really good.

01:26:42.448 --> 01:26:43.616
Can we start to let them in?

01:26:43.616 --> 01:26:45.618
- Uh... Almost.
- All right.

01:26:45.784 --> 01:26:47.369
Five minutes, guys.
10 minutes tops.

01:26:47.369 --> 01:26:48.829
Let's keep these vibes going!

01:26:55.169 --> 01:26:56.670
- Adequate?
- Adequate.

01:27:00.674 --> 01:27:03.052
- Can you imagine being first up?
- Opening the show and all.

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:04.219
Millions of people
trying to decide...

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:06.555
How they want to spend
their Saturday night.

01:27:06.722 --> 01:27:08.807
What's the first thing they see?
No logo, no intro.

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:10.267
Nope. Just a close up
of your pretty face.

01:27:10.267 --> 01:27:11.644
- Nah.
- Nah. Who gives a fuck, right?

01:27:11.644 --> 01:27:12.728
Yeah. It's just
a bunch of animals

01:27:12.728 --> 01:27:13.812
watching their lava lamps.

01:27:13.812 --> 01:27:14.897
You're gonna do great.

01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:15.981
-Yeah.
- Fuck off.

01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:17.191
-We're pullin' for you.
-Break a leg!

01:27:20.152 --> 01:27:22.488
You the writer
Lorne found in a bar?

01:27:23.238 --> 01:27:24.698
That's a slightly romantic read
of the story,

01:27:24.698 --> 01:27:25.866
but, yeah, I guess so.

01:27:26.033 --> 01:27:28.410
All right. Well, jump on in.
Water's warm.

01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:29.578
Okay.

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:31.288
Okay. Quiet, please!

01:27:31.455 --> 01:27:34.291
Work stops now.
We're holding for a sound check.

01:27:34.458 --> 01:27:35.459
Who wants to do the sound check?

01:27:35.626 --> 01:27:37.586
Garrett! Don't you know a song?

01:27:38.712 --> 01:27:39.546
Hmm?

01:27:43.759 --> 01:27:45.511
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Bravo! Garrett!

01:28:40.274 --> 01:28:42.359
- That was fantastic.
-Thank you.

01:28:42.985 --> 01:28:43.986
Thank you.

01:28:44.862 --> 01:28:45.863
That was perfect.

01:28:45.863 --> 01:28:47.406
- You have an incredible voice.
-You're still not

01:28:47.406 --> 01:28:49.450
- gonna give me no lines.
- It was beautiful.

01:28:51.285 --> 01:28:54.163
Uh, gentlemen, how long
have you been standing there?

01:28:54.621 --> 01:28:55.748
Long enough.

01:28:55.914 --> 01:28:57.041
Lorne, we need
to let the audience in.

01:28:57.499 --> 01:28:58.542
No, you don't.

01:29:01.503 --> 01:29:04.006
Perhaps you kids aren't
quite ready for prime time.

01:29:04.173 --> 01:29:05.507
What are you talking about?

01:29:05.841 --> 01:29:07.009
Look around, Lorne.

01:29:07.801 --> 01:29:09.344
You haven't locked a script.

01:29:09.928 --> 01:29:10.929
Your actors are missing.

01:29:11.096 --> 01:29:12.431
Your crew is...

01:29:12.806 --> 01:29:14.308
in open rebellion.

01:29:18.729 --> 01:29:20.647
They'd be laughing at you
in Burbank.

01:29:22.107 --> 01:29:24.193
Burbank? Excuse me?
This is New York fucking City.

01:29:24.359 --> 01:29:25.360
Who's she?

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:26.653
- She... It's...
- It's... I...

01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:29.364
It's complicated.
We have a hell of a show.

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:30.908
We have two bands.

01:29:31.075 --> 01:29:33.118
We have seven of the brightest
comedy minds alive.

01:29:33.285 --> 01:29:34.703
You even know where they are?

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:36.288
Most of them. Yes.

01:29:36.914 --> 01:29:39.541
Maybe we'll just try again
next Saturday.

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:41.251
No. No, no, no. Don't do that.
Come on. No.

01:29:41.418 --> 01:29:43.670
Everybody in this room
has been killing themselves...

01:29:43.837 --> 01:29:45.172
- to make something special.
- I know.

01:29:45.339 --> 01:29:46.673
To make something innovative
and actually good...

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.133
- for a change.
-"For a change"?

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:49.676
Don't tell me that you've been
doing this so long...

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:52.721
that you can't even recognize
the potential for greatness...

01:29:52.888 --> 01:29:54.640
when it's right
in front of your face.

01:29:56.225 --> 01:29:59.019
Do you even know
what this show is? Tell me.

01:30:09.071 --> 01:30:10.572
It's an all-nighter in the city.

01:30:12.157 --> 01:30:15.077
It's catching Richard Pryor
at a drop-in...

01:30:15.244 --> 01:30:18.622
or finding Paul Simon strumming
in the back of a dive bar.

01:30:18.789 --> 01:30:20.999
It's meeting a girl
outside of a bodega...

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:23.127
and getting lucky
in a phone booth.

01:30:24.211 --> 01:30:25.629
It's everything you think
is going to happen

01:30:25.629 --> 01:30:27.589
when you move to the city.
That's our show.

01:30:28.048 --> 01:30:29.383
That's <i>Saturday Night.</i>

01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:30.551
Show me.

01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:32.010
Show you what?

01:30:32.177 --> 01:30:33.595
Show me <i>Saturday Night.</i>

01:30:33.595 --> 01:30:34.763
We go live
in less than 10 minutes.

01:30:34.763 --> 01:30:35.848
10 minutes!

01:30:35.848 --> 01:30:37.307
No, you don't!

01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:40.936
Show me.

01:30:53.157 --> 01:30:57.119
