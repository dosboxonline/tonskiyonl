11:00.735 --> 11:03.887
Mr. Szyslak, your tab is closed.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.312
Surrender your key, sir.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.499
Well, them's the rules, I guess.

11:07.650 --> 11:09.316
It was nice being part
of a place

11:09.336 --> 11:12.245
that was bigger than me
and also super weird.

11:12.397 --> 11:13.838
Uh-- What the...

11:13.990 --> 11:17.175
The penalty for your offense is
far greater than mere expulsion.

11:17.402 --> 11:20.586
Your friends,
your regulars are to be...

11:20.739 --> 11:22.013
cut off.

11:22.165 --> 11:24.182
(glass breaking)

11:24.409 --> 11:26.075
Cut off?! No.
No, that's too horrible.

11:26.094 --> 11:28.002
You can't do that to them!

11:28.021 --> 11:30.246
<i> You</i> did this to them.

11:30.339 --> 11:32.582
They have
until the clock strikes...

11:32.675 --> 11:35.101
happy hour.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.512
<i> Tick, tock, Mr. Szyslak.</i>
<i> Tick, tock.</i>

11:38.532 --> 11:40.699
Guys, you're all in danger!
You...

11:40.850 --> 11:43.760
Oh, sorry. I've never been
in your office before.

11:43.853 --> 11:45.186
Any office, for that matter.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.780
Yeesh. Now I get why
you all drink so much.

11:47.933 --> 11:49.356
You've got a lot of nerve
coming here,

11:49.376 --> 11:51.543
after what you said last night.

11:51.694 --> 11:53.712
I know, I know,
but this is serious, okay?

11:53.863 --> 11:55.714
Some very scary people are mad

11:55.865 --> 11:57.790
for all that drunken blabbing
I did,

11:57.943 --> 12:00.109
so you're being... cut off!

12:00.128 --> 12:03.370
So what? You already lost us
as customers.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.706
No, no, you don't get it.
Cut off.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.058
Aah. There isn't much time,

12:07.285 --> 12:09.285
but I'm gonna keep
being cagey about it.

12:09.378 --> 12:11.045
Oh, wait a minute.
Where's Barney?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.713
Barney doesn't work here.

12:12.766 --> 12:14.399
Really? Seems like he would.

12:14.550 --> 12:16.851
Yeah, that would lead
to some good stories, all right.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.903
Hurry, call him.<i> Call him!</i>

12:19.055 --> 12:21.147
Mm. Fine.

12:21.241 --> 12:25.635
<i> Well, if it isn't</i>
<i> the meanest drunk in town.</i>

12:25.728 --> 12:27.579
Barn, it's happy hour.

12:27.806 --> 12:30.231
You got to lock your doors
and windows right away!

12:30.325 --> 12:33.251
During the best time of day
for ocean breezes?

12:33.402 --> 12:34.919
-No dice.
<i> -Look out for</i>
<i> the dapper gentleman!</i>

12:35.146 --> 12:37.905
Ow! Damn vampire bats!

12:37.924 --> 12:39.148
What the hell was that?

12:39.167 --> 12:41.242
He's been injected
with Antibooze--

12:41.261 --> 12:45.246
a drug that makes it
so he can never drink again.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.432
Antibooze?
That stuff isn't real.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.993
Oh, it's real, and
the side effects are horrible,

12:50.011 --> 12:51.344
unthinkable!

12:51.438 --> 12:53.846
It starts with
a skull-splitting headache.

12:53.999 --> 12:56.232
<i> (yelling)</i>

12:59.428 --> 13:02.030
Then you got
your firehose sweating.

13:03.675 --> 13:05.450
Rhinoceros pox.

13:07.028 --> 13:09.512
And finally, hurricane vomiting.

13:09.531 --> 13:13.041
<i> (liquid pouring</i>
<i>and prolonged yelling on screen)</i>

13:17.798 --> 13:19.798
(sighs)
He's been cut off.

13:20.025 --> 13:21.782
And now they're coming for you.

13:21.802 --> 13:25.545
If they catch ya, you can
never touch alcohol again.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.138
No! No!

13:27.290 --> 13:29.641
Wait. What about rum cakes
and other boozy desserts?

13:29.792 --> 13:31.200
Never again.

13:31.294 --> 13:33.478
<i> No!</i>

13:39.727 --> 13:41.694
(buzzing)

13:50.572 --> 13:54.574
Run faster. Every bartender in
town is coming after youse guys.

13:54.726 --> 13:58.086
All because I couldn't
keep my drunken trap shut!

13:59.731 --> 14:02.415
Well, how many bartenders
could there be in Springfield?

14:02.567 --> 14:06.419
How many people in this town are
miserable at work and at home?

14:06.571 --> 14:08.263
Oh, my God.

14:28.017 --> 14:29.425
You guys, get out of here!

14:29.444 --> 14:31.995
I'll hold 'em off... with this.

14:33.631 --> 14:36.291
(grunting)

14:45.534 --> 14:48.277
Wow. He's like a ninja
with that crotch rag.

14:48.296 --> 14:50.555
That disgusting towel is a blur!

14:53.059 --> 14:55.968
(panting)

14:56.062 --> 14:58.304
(Moe grunts,
electrical buzzing)

14:58.456 --> 14:59.564
(electrical buzzing
and snapping)

15:00.567 --> 15:01.958
(all panting)

15:01.976 --> 15:03.809
This is no way to live.

15:03.962 --> 15:05.886
Hunted. Hunted like dinosaurs.

15:05.980 --> 15:07.980
What are we supposed to do now?

15:08.133 --> 15:09.556
If you ever want to drink again,

15:09.651 --> 15:12.059
all you can do is get
on the next bus out of town

15:12.078 --> 15:13.636
and never stop running.

15:13.655 --> 15:15.288
Sounds like a plan.

15:16.824 --> 15:17.916
(both grunt)

15:18.067 --> 15:20.067
(moaning)

15:20.086 --> 15:22.337
(speaking German)

15:25.316 --> 15:27.166
Those poor bastards.

15:27.318 --> 15:29.318
I must keen for them.

15:29.412 --> 15:31.679
(loud, sorrowful keening)

15:33.249 --> 15:34.840
Forget it, Homer.

15:34.935 --> 15:37.143
They're non-drinkers now.

15:38.496 --> 15:41.088
Marge, pack what you need
and choose one kid.

15:41.107 --> 15:42.756
We're leaving
Springfield forever.

15:42.850 --> 15:44.758
That's ridiculous, Homie.

15:44.852 --> 15:46.669
Look who dropped by for dinner.

15:46.762 --> 15:48.095
Hello, Homer.

15:48.114 --> 15:50.097
Dad, Dr. Hibbert was just
telling us

15:50.116 --> 15:52.508
how he worked his way
through medical school.

15:52.527 --> 15:55.178
I think you'd be interested
to hear how I did it.

15:55.271 --> 15:58.122
-I would?
-Bartending.

16:01.795 --> 16:03.753
(screaming)

16:06.466 --> 16:08.374
Who wants mushroom caps?

16:08.526 --> 16:10.026
(screams)

16:10.044 --> 16:11.544
I'm so sorry, Homer.

16:11.696 --> 16:14.380
And Midge, your husband
can never drink again,

16:14.474 --> 16:16.599
and it's all because of me.
(cries)

16:17.626 --> 16:20.353
(cheering)

16:22.056 --> 16:23.648
Good morning, family.

16:23.799 --> 16:25.632
Mwah. Mwah. Mwah.

16:25.652 --> 16:29.153
You sure I can't make you
some oatmeal with blueberries?

16:29.305 --> 16:31.322
Not today, honey.
I promised to pick up coffee

16:31.549 --> 16:34.400
for everyone on my team
to celebrate our record numbers.

16:34.494 --> 16:38.162
You are so much more of a
go-getter since your promotion.

16:38.314 --> 16:40.981
I love this new, sober you.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.984
And I love any version of you.

16:44.078 --> 16:45.895
Mmm, mmm.

16:45.913 --> 16:47.563
-(coughing)
-Get a room!

16:47.656 --> 16:50.491
Bart, I haven't forgotten about
your skateboard competition.

16:50.585 --> 16:52.010
And don't worry, Lisa.

16:52.161 --> 16:53.827
It'll be over in plenty of time

16:53.847 --> 16:56.422
for me to be front
and center at your recital.

16:56.574 --> 16:58.516
Ooh! (sputtering)

16:58.667 --> 17:01.260
(giggling)

17:01.412 --> 17:03.688
Well, off to the salt mines.

17:03.915 --> 17:05.273
(humming cheerily)

17:08.194 --> 17:10.102
Well, this is a coincidence.

17:10.196 --> 17:13.698
I haven't seen you guys
since, uh, you know.

17:13.849 --> 17:16.759
Geez, it would've had
to have been the syringings?

17:16.778 --> 17:20.187
Yeah, finally got in shape.
Not drinking all day every day

17:20.206 --> 17:22.689
really freed up a lot of time
for me to work out.

17:22.709 --> 17:26.602
And as soon as I filed my
patent, my start-up got funded.

17:26.621 --> 17:29.955
Soon, everyone in America
will have their own personal

17:30.050 --> 17:32.050
body-hair-shaving mini robot.

17:32.277 --> 17:33.793
That's you? (gasps)

17:33.945 --> 17:35.720
I love my Groomba!

17:35.871 --> 17:37.371
(buzzing)

17:37.465 --> 17:39.873
And I got my job back
at Autozone,

17:39.967 --> 17:41.893
so I could finally face my ma.

17:42.044 --> 17:45.805
He holds the big arrow
that says "Autozone."

17:45.899 --> 17:48.048
Yeah, I guess
we're all doing pretty well.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.642
You know who I heard ain't?

17:49.794 --> 17:51.718
A certain bartender.

17:51.813 --> 17:53.738
You won't believe
how low he's sunk.

17:53.889 --> 17:55.981
It would be nice
to laugh at someone

17:56.076 --> 17:58.993
living their lowest moment.

18:02.565 --> 18:05.083
I asked for the ham
in my omelet to be diced.

18:05.234 --> 18:07.343
This ham is clearly cubed.

18:07.345 --> 18:09.979
Yes, ma'am.
Uh, right away, ma'am.

18:09.997 --> 18:11.981
You flipped my omelet too high
in the air,

18:11.999 --> 18:13.925
and it got cold on the descent.

18:14.076 --> 18:17.011
My mistake, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.

18:20.158 --> 18:23.601
I wanted to see him low,
but not eggs-on-demand low.

18:23.752 --> 18:27.355
I bet he doesn't even have
a shotgun under that bar.

18:28.666 --> 18:31.609
Get out of here.
You can't see me like this.

18:31.836 --> 18:36.155
Slingin' eggs in a well-lit,
non-dank environment.

18:41.863 --> 18:43.955
I can't believe
I'm saying this.

18:44.182 --> 18:45.848
We're all saying it.

18:45.867 --> 18:48.017
Even though
we can never drink again,

18:48.035 --> 18:50.962
we still want you
as our bartender.

18:51.189 --> 18:53.038
You... you mean it?

18:53.191 --> 18:54.707
-Yeah.
-We do.
-Mm-hmm.

18:54.859 --> 18:59.637
From now on, you can spray
your own pans, America! Ha.

19:02.367 --> 19:04.267
(cheering)

19:06.813 --> 19:09.063
There you go, fellas.
Bottoms up.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.983
To Moe, our friend.

19:12.210 --> 19:14.560
Nah, nah, guys.
I'm something better.

19:14.712 --> 19:16.245
Your bartender.

19:16.247 --> 19:18.156
Who knew
you could drink water in a bar?

19:18.307 --> 19:20.232
It's, uh, still watered down.

19:20.385 --> 19:22.493
-(laughter)
-Good one, Moe.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.738
(laughter continues)

19:25.890 --> 19:28.557
Well, I have never seen
such a perfect distillation

19:28.651 --> 19:30.168
of the human spirit.

19:30.395 --> 19:33.579
A cocktail of humility
and self-sacrifice

19:33.673 --> 19:35.898
with a dash of un-bitters.

19:35.991 --> 19:37.400
(chuckles)

19:37.418 --> 19:39.568
Whoa, Artemis.
What are you doing here?

19:39.662 --> 19:42.905
Such loyalty to a bartender
deserves a reward.

19:42.998 --> 19:45.499
The antidote to Antibooze.

19:45.593 --> 19:47.076
(all gasping)

19:47.094 --> 19:49.578
Now, think carefully, chaps.

19:49.672 --> 19:54.066
Once injected, you will lose
all the benefits of sobriety.

19:59.924 --> 20:02.116
Go away, Ma.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.994
(gulping)

20:07.022 --> 20:09.540
I'm sorry. I can't go back.

20:09.692 --> 20:12.710
Sobriety has made me the man
I never thought I'd be.

20:12.861 --> 20:15.338
Now I'm going home to my family.

20:23.965 --> 20:26.098
(whirring)

20:28.877 --> 20:29.835
Hmm?

20:29.987 --> 20:31.979
(whimpering)

20:34.400 --> 20:36.192
(buzzing)

20:50.733 --> 20:52.992
Hey, Bart, isn't that
your stupid crystal skull?

20:53.127 --> 20:55.294
Wasn't stupid.
It was my best friend.
