00:42.292 --> 00:44.460
Hey, do you guys know this one?

00:46.755 --> 00:48.630
Now, this is the real shit.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.329
You suck.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.637
Who put the horse out?

01:45.438 --> 01:46.688
She's good.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.195
She... She's been really sick.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.117
Bad, bad, bad girl!

02:04.874 --> 02:07.042
Okay. That'll be $1 7.50.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.961
Hey, buddy! Hey, pay the fare.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.218
l'm Father McFeely.

02:16.344 --> 02:17.511
l'm so glad you're here.

02:17.595 --> 02:19.513
l came as fast as l could,

02:19.597 --> 02:21.807
but at my age, the little soldier needs
a lot more thumping

02:21.891 --> 02:24.059
before it starts pumping,
if you know what l mean.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.644
You know, l do find, though,
if l tickle my asshole

02:25.728 --> 02:29.314
-just before l unleash the dog of war...
-lt's okay. lt's okay. l understand.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.985
You know, because in the old days,
you know, when you...

02:35.071 --> 02:36.446
How is she?

02:37.782 --> 02:38.907
lt's gotten worse, Father.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.742
Really?

02:41.452 --> 02:43.912
She won't eat, she won't talk.

02:45.748 --> 02:48.333
The child won't even let me touch her.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.378
Yes. Sometimes you
have to give them candy.

02:52.755 --> 02:57.217
Father. The church sent me to assist you.
l'm Father Harris.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.219
-Hi. Nice to see you.
-Hi.

02:59.304 --> 03:01.555
Would you like to see the girl?

03:02.640 --> 03:03.849
Soon.

03:04.934 --> 03:07.269
But first l must bless this house.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.414
"The sorrows of death compassed me,

03:27.498 --> 03:29.875
"and the pains of hell got hold upon me.

03:29.959 --> 03:30.959
"l found..."

03:33.296 --> 03:36.048
"Then called l upon
the name of the Lord and..."

03:50.563 --> 03:51.563
"My soul from death."

03:51.940 --> 03:54.983
Oh, God. Please, Lord.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.320
Help me to release this demon.

04:03.326 --> 04:07.037
Thank you, Lord,
the most merciful almighty.

04:07.121 --> 04:08.872
Hold on.

04:13.211 --> 04:14.670
Those enchiladas.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.257
Thank you, Lord.

04:39.570 --> 04:40.904
Fuck this.

04:41.781 --> 04:42.990
Father!

04:43.157 --> 04:46.535
-Fuck! Did you see this? Look at this!
-Please, Father, think of the child.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.703
Fuck!

04:47.787 --> 04:48.870
Yes.

04:56.337 --> 04:57.838
lt's freezing.

05:16.607 --> 05:17.607
Let us pray.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.068
"Defender of the human race,

05:20.445 --> 05:22.904
"look down in pity upon this, your servant."

05:22.989 --> 05:26.074
Shove it up your ass,
you worthless piece of shit.

05:27.535 --> 05:28.744
Silence!

05:30.872 --> 05:31.997
"Holy Lord..."

05:32.081 --> 05:33.832
Your mother is in here with us, Harris.

05:34.250 --> 05:36.918
Would you like to leave a message?
l'll be sure that she gets it.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.755
Yes. Mom, will you get out of there, please?

05:41.924 --> 05:43.008
You're no fun.

05:43.426 --> 05:44.468
l'm working.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.511
See you later, Mrs. Harris.

05:46.763 --> 05:49.348
"Holy Lord, almighty father in..."

05:50.308 --> 05:53.435
"Everlasting God
"and father of our Lord Jesus Christ

05:53.853 --> 05:55.771
"and the Virgin Mary's baby daddy.

05:56.522 --> 06:00.650
"Holy Lord, almighty father, everlasting God

06:00.735 --> 06:04.780
"who once consigned that fallen tyrant
to the flames of hell,

06:05.281 --> 06:09.576
"who sent your only son into the world
to crush that roaring tiger

06:09.786 --> 06:13.413
"and who got that unholy bitch Jerri
kicked off of Survivor... "

06:13.873 --> 06:15.791
Fuck me! Fuck me!

06:17.293 --> 06:20.545
Father!

06:20.671 --> 06:22.714
This is not part of the ritual.

06:24.133 --> 06:27.260
ln the name of the father, the son,
and the holy...

06:52.578 --> 06:53.662
Here you go, Father. All clean.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.163
Thank you so much.

06:55.832 --> 06:56.832
Okay.

07:00.336 --> 07:03.213
You failed, McFeely.
Your weapons are useless against me.

07:04.799 --> 07:05.924
Let us pray.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.802
-Our father who art in heaven...
-Our father who art in heaven...

07:10.805 --> 07:11.847
Stop it!

07:12.306 --> 07:13.557
-Hallowed be thy name.
-Hallowed be thy name.

07:14.725 --> 07:15.767
Zip it.

07:15.852 --> 07:16.893
Thy kingdom come.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.438
Your mother sucks cocks in hell.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.481
Shit!

07:24.193 --> 07:25.277
Suck on this.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.642
So, you think you made it
into the class, Shorty?

07:57.727 --> 07:59.019
l sure hope so, Cindy.

07:59.103 --> 08:00.645
You could use the grade, huh?

08:00.730 --> 08:02.856
Nah. l need a place to stay.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.441
Mom dukes kicked me out.

08:04.984 --> 08:08.153
But you know something? l learned
something very important in college.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.447
-The value of books.
-Really?

08:10.573 --> 08:11.573
Yeah. Look at this here.

08:13.576 --> 08:16.745
Free paper. Shit, son.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.165
Yeah, so how you digging college?

08:20.249 --> 08:23.084
l don't know. lt's okay, l guess.

08:24.128 --> 08:26.254
l feel like such a geek sometimes, though.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.007
Everyone is so cool, and l'm not.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.800
Come on, Cindy.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.469
You ain't that bad.

08:32.553 --> 08:34.763
All you need is a little bit of flavor.

08:35.306 --> 08:37.015
-Maybe some new gear.
-"Gear"?

08:37.099 --> 08:38.600
You know, that's slang for "clothing."

08:40.019 --> 08:42.854
Here. Let me... Come on.
We gonna cool you up right now.

08:42.938 --> 08:45.690
Come on. Don't sit like this, first of all.

08:45.775 --> 08:47.651
Don't sit like that, son. Sit cool.

08:47.735 --> 08:49.694
-Okay.
-Right up, son.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.780
Yeah. Feel yourself, son, like that.

08:51.864 --> 08:53.615
Yeah. Now go like this.

08:55.660 --> 08:56.868
-That's cool.
-Yeah.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.912
Yeah. Now stand up,
let me show you some moves.

08:59.121 --> 09:01.456
-Right, left. Right, left.
-Right, left. Right, left.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.291
Son.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.876
-Right, left.
-Right, left.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.044
-Right, kick.
-Right, kick.

09:06.128 --> 09:07.128
-Son.
-Son.

09:07.296 --> 09:08.380
-Psych.
-Psych.

09:08.464 --> 09:12.425
Throw a little bit of slang in there.
Say, "Yo, that jacket is tight, son.

09:12.635 --> 09:13.677
"Ya mean?"

09:13.761 --> 09:15.804
Yo, that jacket is tight, son.

09:15.888 --> 09:17.931
-Ya mean?
-Ya mean?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.559
Yeah, yeah, something like that.

09:20.768 --> 09:21.768
Throw it all together.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.562
Okay. Right, left.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.105
Right, kick.

09:25.481 --> 09:27.107
Yo, that jacket is tight.

09:27.316 --> 09:29.985
Now run that shit, bitch. Ya mean?

09:32.655 --> 09:34.489
That is the shit, dog.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.784
Man. You boners aren't ready yet?

09:38.327 --> 09:41.788
Dude, relax, man. l'm telling you,
we'll get there on time, all right?

09:41.872 --> 09:43.665
Yo, dogs, what y'all think?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.333
Tucked in or out?

09:46.877 --> 09:48.253
-Out, man.
-Out, man. Come on.

09:48.337 --> 09:50.422
No doubt. No doubt. That's what l thought.
That's what l thought.

09:50.506 --> 09:52.882
Yeah, you fuckheads would be ready
if you weren't partying all night.

09:52.967 --> 09:56.886
Come on, man. lt was so awesome.
We got so wasted, man!

09:57.221 --> 09:58.847
l had, like, a keg myself.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.974
l woke up naked in a tub of ice.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.018
-All right!
-Yeah, man.

10:04.186 --> 10:06.479
Shit, Ray, you got a tattoo.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.024
Shit. What's it say?

10:09.191 --> 10:10.775
-"Ray"!
-Oh, man.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.986
Shit, you got a tattoo, too.

10:13.070 --> 10:14.321
-Really? Dude!
-Yeah.

10:14.405 --> 10:16.197
Dude, what... What's it say?

10:17.366 --> 10:19.242
-"Fucked me."
-Sweet, man.

10:19.327 --> 10:23.121
-"Ray..."
-"Fucked me."

10:23.205 --> 10:24.956
-"Ray fucked me."
-"Ray fucked me."

10:25.041 --> 10:26.374
Yeah!

10:27.960 --> 10:29.294
What, man?

10:31.297 --> 10:32.839
Wedgie moment!

10:33.215 --> 10:36.301
Come on.
You're gonna give me a yeast infection.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.637
Hey, girl, that jacket is slamming.

10:38.721 --> 10:40.096
-Thanks.
-You better be careful, though.

10:40.181 --> 10:43.266
Some girl got her ass whipped
and her little jacket stolen earlier today.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.352
Some people is so ghetto.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.688
-What class we got next?
-Psychology.

10:48.773 --> 10:51.066
Me, too! 1 01 ?

10:51.150 --> 10:53.568
-ln room 302 at 1 0:00?
-That's it!

10:53.653 --> 10:56.529
No. This is too much.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.698
l got these psychic powers on lock.

10:58.783 --> 11:00.367
Remind me to get a lotto ticket tomorrow.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.369
Don't split the pole now.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.580
That is very, very bad luck.
My psychic told me.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.499
You don't really
believe in that stuff, do you?

11:07.583 --> 11:09.334
Yes, l do. Very much.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.218
-Are these all the subjects?
-Yes, sir.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.804
l took the liberty of putting those
with near-death experiences

11:20.888 --> 11:21.888
on the very top.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.348
Any of them hot?

11:24.266 --> 11:26.935
As l'm sure you are aware, Professor,

11:27.019 --> 11:29.813
subjects who are close to death
are statistically more likely

11:29.897 --> 11:32.816
to have the suggestibility required
for paranormal investigation,

11:32.900 --> 11:37.153
which is why, of course,
l gave them special consideration.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.780
Good thinking, Dwight.

11:39.156 --> 11:41.533
Traumatized coeds are a sure thing.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.704
l like her.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.081
Yes, sir. That is Cindy Campbell.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.583
A classic abandoned personality disorder.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.460
She seems guarded, but willing.

11:53.629 --> 11:54.921
And this?

11:55.005 --> 11:56.423
That is Ray Wilkins, sir.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.049
l couldn't quite figure him out,

11:58.134 --> 12:00.719
but he seemed very eager
and pleased to meet me.

12:01.637 --> 12:02.971
What's this?

12:04.682 --> 12:07.767
lt's a picture that he sent after the interview.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.103
Where did you find these kids?

12:10.271 --> 12:13.815
Sir, they're all survivors
of the Stevenston County massacre.

12:15.317 --> 12:17.277
Fantastic!

12:18.571 --> 12:21.573
These kids are exactly the catalyst we need

12:22.116 --> 12:24.993
to awaken the spirits of Hell House.

12:26.454 --> 12:29.414
Sir, exactly how are we
going to get them up there?

12:29.498 --> 12:32.500
We'll tell them it's part of the class.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.961
We'll say... Excuse me.

12:35.504 --> 12:39.215
...that they're participating in a study
of sleep disorders.

12:39.550 --> 12:41.342
We are going to make history, Dwight.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.762
The first documented,

12:44.013 --> 12:48.141
unrefuted evidence of life after death.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.684
Welcome, everybody.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.686
l'm Professor Oldman.

12:52.563 --> 12:56.191
Each of you have been carefully selected
to be in this class

12:56.275 --> 13:01.237
for which you receive an automatic
grade ofA upon completion.

13:02.239 --> 13:05.617
Now, this year's study is insomnia.

13:06.869 --> 13:09.412
We are going to spend the weekend together

13:09.497 --> 13:11.831
where we've established
a controlled environment

13:11.916 --> 13:15.543
in which we'll study
your various sleep disorders.

13:16.545 --> 13:18.421
Now, l'll be passing out directions...

13:18.506 --> 13:20.423
-l can do it.
-l can... No.

13:20.549 --> 13:21.800
-No, Dwight.
-l can do it.

13:21.884 --> 13:25.053
l can myself do it.

13:25.971 --> 13:29.390
Now, you should all be there
by 6:00 p.m. tonight

13:29.975 --> 13:32.018
and plan to stay through Monday.

13:32.478 --> 13:33.770
l'll see you all this evening.

13:34.730 --> 13:35.814
Hey!

13:36.232 --> 13:38.733
-You left your book back there.
-Thanks.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.486
l'm Cindy.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.071
-Buddy.
-Hey.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.282
So, looks like we're gonna spend
the weekend together.

13:46.408 --> 13:48.535
-Yeah.
-You want to get together and

13:49.703 --> 13:50.829
study or something?

13:51.789 --> 13:53.122
Study?

13:54.583 --> 13:55.583
That was kind of bad.

13:56.627 --> 13:58.253
l'm sorry, Buddy.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.879
You seem like a really nice guy,

13:59.964 --> 14:03.424
but l just got out
of a really bad relationship,

14:03.551 --> 14:06.261
so l'm not quite ready to start dating yet.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.431
But, hey, you know,
maybe we could be friends.

14:10.599 --> 14:13.268
Sure. Yeah. Cool. That... Friends.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.687
Okay. See you later, friend.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.272
All right, pal.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.777
Wedgie! Smell you later!

14:47.428 --> 14:50.722
Hey! Will you shut the fuck up
and let me sing?

15:34.600 --> 15:55.870
Hello?

15:58.332 --> 15:59.874
Hi, little guy.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.000
Look at you.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.711
Little? l'm not little.
l'm hung like a bull, lady.

16:04.296 --> 16:07.006
Check it out.
You ever seen a bird dick this big?

16:07.132 --> 16:09.300
-Too much for you, huh, baby?
-Yeah.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.594
All right. Well, step off then, sweet cheeks.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.304
Come back when you want some real loving.

16:14.890 --> 16:15.932
Okay.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.142
Fucking tease.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.110
Hello?

16:38.205 --> 16:40.331
l'm... l'm sorry, child.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.959
Did l frighten you, child?

16:43.043 --> 16:45.920
l'm sorry. Are you scared?

16:46.422 --> 16:48.381
All right. l'll sing to you.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.767
Better?

17:00.436 --> 17:02.937
l'm here with Professor Oldman's group.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.396
l'm Hanson.

17:04.772 --> 17:06.190
l'm the caretaker.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.442
-Hi.
-Hi.

17:07.568 --> 17:09.444
And what's your name, sweet child?

17:09.528 --> 17:11.529
-l'm Cindy.
-Cindy.

17:12.448 --> 17:15.616
But the resemblance is striking.

17:15.867 --> 17:20.454
Look at the thin cheek bones
and the same lips.

17:20.622 --> 17:22.665
Same eyes.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.459
Look at your hair.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.210
l'm sorry.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.128
You've got the same nose.

17:28.630 --> 17:32.133
Tickle, tickle.
Be-boop, be-boop on the nose.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.220
Shall l show you to your room?

17:36.472 --> 17:38.973
That's heavy. That's heavy!

17:39.141 --> 17:41.184
l better use my strong hand.

17:41.852 --> 17:44.062
-Clumsy.
-No, that's fine.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.023
-Look, you got the panties...
-No. l can take care of it.

17:47.149 --> 17:49.025
Look at all what you got here.

17:52.654 --> 17:53.780
Can't forget your toothbrush.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.865
Gonna need that for later.

17:55.949 --> 17:58.201
Okay. Here we go. Follow me, child.

17:58.660 --> 17:59.994
-Oh, God.
-Watch my bottom.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.079
Coming through.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.997
Come on. Right this way.

18:03.165 --> 18:04.540
Here we are.

18:06.752 --> 18:10.004
So, do you live here by yourself?

18:10.464 --> 18:11.923
Well, yes. We've tried to rent it out,

18:12.007 --> 18:14.759
but people don't seem
to want to stay very long.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.386
There's old mother Kane.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.098
And that's old master Kane.

18:21.225 --> 18:22.600
Who's that?

18:23.352 --> 18:25.186
That's Big Daddy Kane.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.355
He's cute.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.481
Yeah.

18:28.565 --> 18:31.025
That was the master's favorite toy.

18:31.652 --> 18:33.778
l don't know what it's doing out here.

18:33.862 --> 18:38.199
l swear. Sometimes l think
these toys have a mind of their own.

18:48.710 --> 18:50.169
Right this way.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.590
No, no, no. Not that room, sweetheart. No.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.968
No. That was the master's mistress's room.

18:57.845 --> 19:01.055
Yeah, he kind of was a little bit of a hornball.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.016
No. You go and stay right over here.

19:04.101 --> 19:07.311
This was the room that belonged
to the love of his life.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.147
His wife, Caroline.

19:10.566 --> 19:12.150
l'll show it to you.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.527
Watch. My fanny's coming through.

19:14.611 --> 19:17.363
Watch it. Make room for fanny.

19:17.447 --> 19:18.698
Wow!

19:19.241 --> 19:20.741
lt's beautiful.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.076
Well, thank you, child.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.995
You know, l have been working out.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.955
l've been doing my bun busters every day.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.749
l squeeze really tight, and then l let loose.

19:29.376 --> 19:31.085
l squeeze really tight

19:31.837 --> 19:33.379
and then let loose.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.090
Okay.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.803
Yes.

19:41.096 --> 19:42.263
Look at this.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.265
Caroline looked beautiful in that dress.

19:45.100 --> 19:47.143
ln fact, she always looked her best.

19:47.227 --> 19:51.606
Do you know that she used to entertain
for royalty and common folk?

19:52.399 --> 19:54.275
Even the president of the United States.

20:01.617 --> 20:05.286
Don't be frightened, child.
This is just Mr. Kittles.

20:05.412 --> 20:07.622
He was the master's favorite pet.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.999
He's been in the family for generations.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.627
Look at him. He hasn't aged a day.

20:13.212 --> 20:16.714
All right, child, well,
l think l'll take my leave.

20:16.798 --> 20:19.759
You let me know
if there's anything you need.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.387
Yes, and as you can see, Professor,
l've taken care of everything,

20:23.472 --> 20:25.890
including medical supplies
and blood storage.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.433
We want to be safe.

20:27.517 --> 20:30.019
Are these cameras
all throughout the house?

20:30.145 --> 20:32.230
Yes, sir. l thought that would be best.

20:32.314 --> 20:36.567
So, if one of our little chickadees
were to be taking a shower,

20:36.652 --> 20:38.653
which button would l press
to get a close-up?

20:39.279 --> 20:40.279
That one.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.656
-This one?
-That one.

20:44.660 --> 20:49.163
Excuse me, Professor,
but your guests have begun to arrive,

20:49.998 --> 20:52.416
and supper shall be served shortly.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.210
Okay. Thanks, handyman.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.420
l'm actually the caretaker.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.007
Aren't those cool new skates?

21:00.217 --> 21:01.676
Now, you be careful with those.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.427
Don't want to fall and break something.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.388
That's funny. That's real funny.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.223
Let me give you a hand.

21:09.059 --> 21:11.352
Well, that's awful kind of you.

21:11.770 --> 21:13.646
How about you give me a standing ovation?

21:13.730 --> 21:15.064
Why don't you lift me up?

21:15.148 --> 21:17.858
Okay. l see where
you're going with this one.

21:17.985 --> 21:20.319
You look familiar to me. Were you in Stomp?

21:20.404 --> 21:21.904
Hey, you can kiss my grits.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.282
l think l'll be the bigger man now
and walk away.

21:24.950 --> 21:26.575
Walk away.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.161
l'll go and change for dinner.

21:29.246 --> 21:30.788
-Okay.
-l'll see you shortly.

21:30.872 --> 21:32.039
Sounds good.

21:32.207 --> 21:35.126
l'll just run upstairs
and jump into my jogging suit.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.210
l'll be right down.

21:38.422 --> 21:39.547
Hey!

21:40.340 --> 21:42.508
Hey there, little guy. How you doing?

21:42.592 --> 21:43.718
Fuck off, four eyes.

21:45.971 --> 21:46.971
l beg your pardon?

21:47.055 --> 21:50.308
l said, "Fuck off, four eyes."

21:51.685 --> 21:53.519
l ought to kick your ass.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.229
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

21:55.314 --> 21:57.440
Relax, son. lt's just a bird.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.777
Hello, birdie. Polly want a cracker?

22:01.862 --> 22:04.071
Polly wants your mama's sweet ass.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.656
What did Polly say to me?

22:05.741 --> 22:09.577
l said, "Polly wants your mama's sweet ass."

22:09.911 --> 22:11.829
You don't be talking about my mama, son.

22:11.955 --> 22:13.331
You don't know my mama, son.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.583
Yeah, l know your mama.
l fucked her last night.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.501
You want beef? l'll fuck you up!

22:17.586 --> 22:19.587
l'm shaking. l'm shaking.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.839
Now, fuck this.
l'm gonna handle this shit like a gentleman.

22:21.923 --> 22:22.965
Yo, hold my tooth, son.

22:23.050 --> 22:25.343
Yeah, come on, bitch.
You and that Welcome Back, Kotter haircut.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.927
Want a piece of me? Come on. Bring it on.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.179
What, you hard core? Give me some.

22:28.263 --> 22:31.140
-Bring it on, bitch.
-No, no, no. What?

22:31.224 --> 22:32.600
You gonna talk, son? Then do it.

22:32.726 --> 22:35.102
Come on, pussy. Let me out of here.
l'll fuck you up.

22:36.605 --> 22:37.605
Hi, guys.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.065
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:39.858 --> 22:40.858
Hey, Buddy.

22:40.942 --> 22:41.942
-Hey, Cin.
-How you doing?

22:42.486 --> 22:43.611
Open chest!

22:43.862 --> 22:46.947
Come on. You got to be
quicker than that, A cup.

22:50.243 --> 22:51.285
Hey, guys.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.703
-Hey!
-How you doing?

22:53.747 --> 22:55.539
Well, are you boys just gonna sit there
with your mouths open,

22:55.624 --> 22:57.208
or is someone gonna offer me a seat?

23:03.799 --> 23:04.840
l warmed it up for you.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.717
lt's the best seat in the house.

23:06.802 --> 23:08.219
Second best.

23:10.639 --> 23:12.807
Professor, is this the same house

23:12.891 --> 23:15.726
that a young girl was possessed
by a demon or something?

23:15.811 --> 23:18.771
Yes, it was reported
but never substantiated.

23:23.985 --> 23:26.904
All right. Well, who'd like some appetizers?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.239
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:28.323 --> 23:29.907
That's what l like to hear.

23:29.991 --> 23:32.243
Hey, these buns look good.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.452
Yeah.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.454
And they're so soft and warm.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.540
-Ray!
-l'm sorry. My bad.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.041
These are delicious.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.502
Thank you, my child. l made them by hand.

23:44.005 --> 23:45.548
Okay.

23:45.924 --> 23:49.718
Here we go.
l think the taters are just about done.

23:49.928 --> 23:53.222
l'm just gonna give them
one quick whisk here.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.442
Okay, now. Dig in.

24:06.361 --> 24:08.529
All right. Now it's time for the turkey.

24:09.281 --> 24:10.656
What a beautiful bird.

24:10.740 --> 24:11.949
-No!
-No, man!

24:12.033 --> 24:13.075
Hey! Hey! Hey, man.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.078
Why don't you just relax
and just let me do that for you?

24:16.288 --> 24:18.330
-Yeah.
-Rest that little hand.

24:18.415 --> 24:22.168
lt's my pleasure,
but what a nice young man to offer.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.669
Let me give you a little pinch there.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.130
-Come on.
-Fuck it!

24:28.216 --> 24:31.802
You know, a lot of people
are kind of intimidated

24:31.887 --> 24:33.637
about making a turkey,

24:33.722 --> 24:36.056
but really it's very simple.

24:36.141 --> 24:38.142
You just have to know
the anatomy of a turkey,

24:38.226 --> 24:41.353
and it's got, over here,
just the tiniest little stink hole,

24:41.897 --> 24:45.065
but it's big enough to get your hand
right up inside it.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.737
Stuff the shit out of it.

24:50.071 --> 24:51.655
l cook it with all the giblets,

24:51.740 --> 24:53.449
the penises and the ginies.

24:53.783 --> 24:56.577
And now, a lot of people
like to baste their turkeys,

24:56.661 --> 24:58.120
but l use this.

24:59.498 --> 25:00.915
l lick like that.

25:01.249 --> 25:02.791
And get into the little

25:03.168 --> 25:04.585
hiney hiney ho...

25:06.004 --> 25:07.171
That's nice and good.

25:07.255 --> 25:10.549
l don't know what the hell that is,
but l'll lick it anyway.

25:10.759 --> 25:11.800
Up and down,

25:11.885 --> 25:13.844
and then l like to get that right on there.

25:16.932 --> 25:18.224
Hiawatha!

25:19.267 --> 25:20.351
And l got one of these.

25:20.435 --> 25:23.604
l'm gonna pull that off, and bam!
That just kicks it up a little bit.

25:23.980 --> 25:27.024
All right. l think that's almost ready now.

25:27.108 --> 25:28.275
And then we bring it to the table.

25:31.446 --> 25:32.613
Good.

25:32.739 --> 25:35.115
All right. Who's ready for a wing?

25:35.450 --> 25:36.742
Yours or the turkey's?

25:39.579 --> 25:40.955
l just thought that was funny.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.998
Well, l know what you'd like.

25:43.083 --> 25:44.291
How about a leg?

25:46.920 --> 25:48.128
How about two?

25:48.755 --> 25:51.257
How about l take these two legs
and shove them right up your ass

25:51.341 --> 25:52.424
all the way to the knee!

25:52.509 --> 25:54.134
Dwight. Dwight, relax.

25:54.928 --> 25:57.179
Hanson, may l ask you,

25:57.264 --> 26:01.642
is there something on the menu
that you haven't personally prepared?

26:03.103 --> 26:05.229
Well, l ordered out the dessert.

26:05.313 --> 26:07.064
-All right!
-All right!

26:07.148 --> 26:09.483
Make room. Here comes the pie.

26:09.776 --> 26:11.986
All right. Okay.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.239
Who wants the first piece of that pie?

26:15.323 --> 26:17.950
l see you eyeing the first piece.

26:20.161 --> 26:21.745
That's good.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.832
-Pass that down to her, will you?
-Thank you.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.417
That's nice.

26:27.711 --> 26:31.171
My germs.

26:31.881 --> 26:33.215
My germs! Hey...

26:47.147 --> 26:50.190
Come play with me.

26:52.944 --> 26:54.278
Come play.

27:00.201 --> 27:01.368
Hello?

28:14.984 --> 28:18.404
Cindy. Cindy.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.406
Who is it?

28:20.490 --> 28:22.449
l want to help you, Cindy.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.867
Who are you?

28:23.952 --> 28:25.869
You're in danger, Cindy.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.538
l want to help you.

28:27.622 --> 28:30.207
Help me how? Who's in danger?

28:30.291 --> 28:33.252
Check the music room.
Check the music room.

28:33.336 --> 28:34.545
Where are you?

28:34.629 --> 28:36.672
Check the fucking music room!

28:39.134 --> 28:40.801
Hey, Cindy, think fast!

28:44.514 --> 28:45.681
Dude, you suck!

28:48.351 --> 28:49.601
Buddy...

28:50.311 --> 28:51.562
About this friendship thing...

28:51.646 --> 28:54.398
Yeah, l think it is so cool
having a girl as a friend.

28:54.482 --> 28:57.151
That's just it, Buddy. l am a girl.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.403
You can't be so rough with me.

28:59.612 --> 29:01.280
Well, then what the hell
are we supposed to do?

29:02.157 --> 29:03.657
Gentle stuff.

29:03.950 --> 29:08.954
You know, like talking and sharing secrets
and past experiences.

29:09.038 --> 29:10.789
You know, stuff like that.

29:11.791 --> 29:13.667
That sounds kind of gay.

29:14.169 --> 29:15.961
Well, l guess since you're a girl,
it's all right then, right?

29:16.045 --> 29:17.838
Yeah. lt'll be fine.

29:18.006 --> 29:19.173
-All right.
-Hey, listen.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.049
Will you come check
something out with me?

29:21.134 --> 29:22.176
-Yeah. Sure.
-Okay.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.386
-We can practice our talking.
-Yeah. Exactly.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.723
l want to tell you about this thing that
happened to me when l was in high school.

29:27.807 --> 29:28.932
Really? What happened?

29:29.017 --> 29:31.059
This hot Spanish chick's
like licking my nuts, right...

29:31.144 --> 29:32.269
Buddy!

29:32.353 --> 29:33.896
No, no. This is the best part.

29:34.355 --> 29:35.981
Oh, my God. Look.

29:36.232 --> 29:38.692
Dude! Someone's on the rag!

29:39.819 --> 29:41.779
They lead straight to the bookcase.

29:55.043 --> 29:59.213
God! Must be a secret study or something.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.225
Wow.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.485
Oh, my God.

30:21.569 --> 30:24.947
lt says Hugh Kane and his mistress
were murdered in this house.

30:25.073 --> 30:26.615
Whoa. Check this out.

30:29.994 --> 30:33.497
-This must be his wife.
-Oh, my God. She looks just like you.

30:33.873 --> 30:35.207
You think?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.000
She's really beautiful.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.252
Yeah.

30:38.545 --> 30:41.463
Well, actually, her hair doesn't have
as many split ends as yours,

30:41.548 --> 30:43.632
and her skin isn't as oily as yours, either.

30:43.716 --> 30:45.509
Also, sometimes your eyes
get kind of squinty,

30:45.593 --> 30:47.845
and you look like you might
have Down syndrome or something.

30:48.096 --> 30:50.222
Other than that, though,
the resemblance is uncanny.

30:50.306 --> 30:51.515
-Really?
-Yeah.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.308
Also, her tits are perfect.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.018
They're not pointy
or funny-looking like yours,

30:55.103 --> 30:56.270
or spaced too far apart.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.272
Okay! Enough!

30:59.607 --> 31:00.691
God.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.652
Oh, my God, look at this.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.447
"Caroline."

31:08.324 --> 31:09.783
Must have been hers.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.203
Oh, my God.

31:13.288 --> 31:15.539
All right. Let's get out of here.
This place gives me the creeps.

31:15.623 --> 31:17.040
Okay. Grab the chest.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.458
Thanks.

31:18.585 --> 31:19.710
-Buddy!
-What?

31:19.794 --> 31:22.129
-l meant the chest.
-Right.

32:00.835 --> 32:02.377
What the...

32:11.471 --> 32:12.512
Hey.

32:15.391 --> 32:16.516
Nice.

32:31.449 --> 32:32.991
Okay.

32:33.242 --> 32:34.326
Hello!

32:34.410 --> 32:36.328
lf l had known, l would have freshened up!

32:36.412 --> 32:37.788
l wish you would have freshened up, too.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.039
Get up there! Come on!

32:39.123 --> 32:41.083
-You want this?
-Yeah. Whose is it?

32:41.167 --> 32:43.210
That's it, Daddy. Take it like you want it.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.586
Give it to me!

32:44.712 --> 32:46.171
-Yeah! Yeah!
-Don't you...

32:46.255 --> 32:47.464
-Yeah!
-...run from me.

32:47.548 --> 32:48.632
Come here!

32:48.716 --> 32:49.758
Bring it on!

32:49.842 --> 32:51.385
Kinky's my middle name, bitch!

32:51.678 --> 32:53.011
Yeah!

32:53.638 --> 32:56.223
That was the best that l've ever had.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.976
Mrs. Huey Kane.

32:59.143 --> 33:00.978
Doesn't that just have a ring to it?

33:03.147 --> 33:04.231
Baby?

33:04.607 --> 33:06.066
Where you going?

33:06.818 --> 33:08.068
Call me!

33:16.411 --> 33:17.577
Let's do something freaky.

33:19.288 --> 33:20.664
Like what, Ray?

33:20.748 --> 33:21.832
l don't know.

33:21.916 --> 33:25.085
l don't know.
Why don't you talk dirty to me?

33:25.920 --> 33:27.671
l don't know what to say, Ray.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.881
Come on. Just make something up.

33:31.801 --> 33:34.678
Ray, why do you make me so bad?

33:34.762 --> 33:37.097
Come on. Because you a bad girl.

33:37.765 --> 33:38.765
Okay.

33:41.310 --> 33:42.352
l'm gonna work this.

33:42.437 --> 33:43.562
Yeah. Work it.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.689
l'm gonna make this mine.

33:45.773 --> 33:47.858
lt's all yours. Yeah.

33:47.942 --> 33:51.403
l'm gonna piss on your face,
and then l'm gonna fart in your mouth.

33:51.487 --> 33:54.072
Yeah! And then l'm gonna
shit on these walls, Ray!

33:54.157 --> 33:55.240
Hey, hey! Hey!

33:57.660 --> 33:58.702
Too dirty?

34:04.667 --> 34:05.709
Hello?

34:09.839 --> 34:12.215
Hey, kitty, kitty.

34:12.632 --> 34:13.842
Hi, little fella.

34:25.813 --> 34:27.898
Okay. Okay.

34:28.315 --> 34:29.649
That's okay, cat.

34:32.277 --> 34:35.822
l think l know why you're mad, Mr. Cat.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.868
l didn't mean to go poopie in your litter box.

34:46.501 --> 34:49.668
Help! My pussy's gone crazy!

35:19.033 --> 35:21.284
Okay. You want a piece of me?

35:23.955 --> 35:26.123
Yeah! How do you like that, little pussy?

35:26.457 --> 35:27.707
Come on!

35:29.502 --> 35:31.169
Yeah! Yeah! Come on!

35:35.216 --> 35:36.383
ls that all you got?

35:36.717 --> 35:37.968
Come on!

35:38.052 --> 35:39.261
Give me your best shot!

35:55.653 --> 35:57.654
l'm telling you, Professor, it was possessed.

35:58.072 --> 36:01.575
-Theo, did you see this animal?
-No, l didn't.

36:01.659 --> 36:04.411
l heard all the commotion,
but by the time l went in there,

36:04.495 --> 36:05.912
l guess it was gone.

36:08.082 --> 36:10.167
What? So, you think l did this to myself?

36:10.251 --> 36:14.754
No. All l'm saying is that cats are known
to be very territorial animals,

36:15.047 --> 36:19.301
and it's likely that it did attack,
but that doesn't mean it was possessed.

36:21.971 --> 36:25.098
Maybe you two should sleep together.

36:25.600 --> 36:27.309
What are you getting at, Professor?

36:27.685 --> 36:30.937
l'm just saying that if indeed
this cat did attack,

36:31.189 --> 36:35.275
it's less likely to come back
if the two of you were, let's say,

36:36.319 --> 36:37.611
together.

36:38.362 --> 36:40.363
Oh, come on, it's college.

36:40.448 --> 36:42.282
lt's time for you two to experiment.

36:42.867 --> 36:45.076
l don't think we're gonna
be getting much help here.

36:45.161 --> 36:46.203
On the contrary, actually,

36:46.287 --> 36:48.163
l'd be more than happy
to walk you through it.

36:48.289 --> 36:50.415
Come on, Cin.
l'll make sure you get tucked in.

36:50.499 --> 36:53.960
Good idea.
Don't forget to kiss each other good night.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.964
There's something going on
in this house, Professor.

36:58.132 --> 36:59.799
l'm not crazy!

37:02.678 --> 37:04.346
One, two,

37:04.805 --> 37:10.727
three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

37:10.811 --> 37:12.312
nine, Brandon, 1 0,

37:12.647 --> 37:13.813
1 1 , Brandon, come on!

37:13.898 --> 37:14.981
Count with me!

37:34.377 --> 37:35.627
Hey, you.

37:37.922 --> 37:39.422
Come here a minute.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.634
Come here.

37:48.391 --> 37:49.557
Peek-a-boo!

37:53.604 --> 37:54.938
-Come on, let's play!
-Stop it!

37:56.023 --> 37:58.024
This is a fun game.

37:59.610 --> 38:00.819
Hey, what are you doing?

38:00.903 --> 38:02.279
Uncle Ray-Ray's got a game.

38:02.363 --> 38:03.446
Hey, get your finger out of there.

38:03.531 --> 38:04.906
Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle...

38:07.076 --> 38:08.243
You want to play with Uncle Ray?

38:08.369 --> 38:09.703
Peek-a-boo!

38:12.873 --> 38:14.165
Help!

38:15.584 --> 38:16.626
Oh, God!

38:16.711 --> 38:18.211
Here's a little balloon animal.

38:30.391 --> 38:33.101
"I can't take living with him any longer.

38:33.185 --> 38:35.186
"He's becoming a monster.

38:35.646 --> 38:38.064
"I suspect he was having an affair.

38:38.149 --> 38:41.151
"I believe he's sleeping
with our babysitter Victoria.

38:41.235 --> 38:45.071
"It must be why he keeps her around
because we have no children."

38:45.197 --> 38:49.409
Cindy. l want you to know
what happened, Cindy.

38:59.378 --> 39:00.879
Hello, Cindy.

39:00.963 --> 39:02.255
Hello, Professor.

39:11.098 --> 39:12.932
l take it you're not mad at me anymore.

39:13.225 --> 39:15.477
l wouldn't go that far, Professor.

39:16.729 --> 39:19.272
-Why don't you just relax?
-Okay.

39:35.206 --> 39:37.624
l think she's starting to suspect something.

39:38.459 --> 39:39.542
Who?

39:41.587 --> 39:42.837
Your wife.

39:47.718 --> 39:49.094
Oh, my God.

39:49.678 --> 39:51.388
-lt happened right here.
-What?

39:51.639 --> 39:52.680
She came home.

39:53.307 --> 39:54.599
-She saw them!
-Saw who?

39:55.059 --> 39:57.102
l was in my room reading herjournal.

39:57.478 --> 40:00.063
Then l found this dress in the closet.

40:00.731 --> 40:02.607
That's all l remember.

40:03.442 --> 40:04.651
What about you, Ray?

40:05.069 --> 40:08.154
l bought mine on Friday.
l just came down to get a banana.

40:09.073 --> 40:10.365
Shit is hot, right?

40:11.617 --> 40:13.660
Good night, little plant.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.995
You drink all this little water up

40:16.163 --> 40:19.290
so you can grow up to be
a nice strong chron plant.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.875
Yes. Yes.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.961
And then you'll be smoked by all the rappers

40:23.045 --> 40:26.798
and make them do a whole lot of dumb shit
that fuck up their careers.

40:26.882 --> 40:28.299
Yes, you will.

40:30.010 --> 40:31.678
Night-night, baby.

40:42.481 --> 40:44.816
l'm gonna rob that bitch tonight.

40:55.035 --> 40:57.454

42:20.454 --> 42:21.496

-Put him out.

42:21.580 --> 42:23.206
This shit burns more than a perm!

42:31.632 --> 42:34.592
There's a whole lot of freaky shit
going on in this house.

42:35.302 --> 42:37.512
There's more to this story
than the Professor told us.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.515
Last night, l found a secret room,

42:41.141 --> 42:43.935
and l found all these newspaper clippings
about Hugh Kane.

42:44.645 --> 42:46.646
He was a really evil man.

42:47.606 --> 42:49.691
And l found a picture of his wife.

42:51.151 --> 42:53.111
Oh, my God! She looks just like you.

42:53.195 --> 42:55.071
-You think?
-Yeah.

42:55.155 --> 42:59.158
She doesn't have as many split ends,
and her skin's not as oily as yours.

42:59.451 --> 43:00.827
Yeah. Yeah.

43:00.911 --> 43:02.829
Sometimes you do this little
squinty thing with your eyes.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.539
lt looks like you got
Down syndrome or something.

43:04.623 --> 43:06.332
Yeah, y'all look just alike,

43:07.126 --> 43:09.252
except she got some perfect boobs,

43:09.336 --> 43:11.087
and yours look like them
old orangutan titties.

43:12.715 --> 43:13.923
Shit, son!

43:14.008 --> 43:16.175
Got to put you in
the full nelson to lick them.

43:18.971 --> 43:20.680
Okay! Enough!

43:22.850 --> 43:26.311
Anyway, l think she killed him,
and now he wants me.

43:26.395 --> 43:28.104
Yeah. Right, bitch.

43:44.705 --> 43:46.456
Morning, Dwight. Let me help you.

43:46.540 --> 43:49.167
l don't need your help. l can do it myself.

43:53.380 --> 43:56.799
Okay. Professor, we need to talk.

43:57.301 --> 43:58.635
What is it, Dwight?

43:58.719 --> 44:01.220
l think you should consider
cutting the experiment short.

44:01.305 --> 44:02.388
What?

44:02.473 --> 44:05.600
This poltergeist is growing
increasingly more violent.

44:05.684 --> 44:08.478
l think we're all in danger here,
and l've got to put my foot down

44:08.562 --> 44:11.981
and stand up for what l believe in
and say that we've got to pull the plug.

44:12.316 --> 44:14.692
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Dwight.

44:14.777 --> 44:16.444
l say when we pull the plug.

44:17.237 --> 44:18.988
We are on the verge of greatness,

44:19.615 --> 44:22.367
and l am this close to getting laid.

44:22.660 --> 44:25.620
Now, the bus arrives on Monday.
No one leaves till then.

44:25.996 --> 44:30.625
Here are the keys to the gate.
No one gets access to them.

44:31.418 --> 44:32.585
Yes, sir.

44:34.171 --> 44:36.964
Okay, guys,
l think the Professor's up to something.

44:37.049 --> 44:38.508
l heard Dwight tell the Professor

44:38.592 --> 44:40.176
that there could be a poltergeist
in the house

44:40.260 --> 44:41.803
and that we could all be in danger!

44:41.887 --> 44:44.097
No, son! Not a poltergeist!

44:45.599 --> 44:46.724
What's a poltergeist?

44:46.809 --> 44:49.018
-l'm getting out of here.
-No. We can't go anywhere.

44:49.103 --> 44:51.437
The gates are locked.
Dwight's the only one who has the keys.

44:51.522 --> 44:53.064
-Baby, get my Vaseline.
-l'm gonna have to handle...

44:53.148 --> 44:55.608
Get my Vaseline, a banana,
and some duct tape.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.944
-l'm gonna break his legs.
-l'm gonna fuck that little cripple up!

44:58.404 --> 45:01.447
Guys, just give me five minutes
alone with him, okay?

45:01.740 --> 45:03.074
l'll get the keys.

45:09.623 --> 45:10.623
Hello, Dwight.

45:13.127 --> 45:14.711
Hi, Theo. Hi.

45:17.089 --> 45:18.840
What you working on?

45:19.550 --> 45:22.051
Just a little experiment.

45:22.469 --> 45:25.471
Work, work, work.

45:26.098 --> 45:27.306
ls that all you ever do?

45:27.599 --> 45:30.601
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.

45:31.812 --> 45:35.273
You know, the Professor
might have everyone else fooled,

45:35.357 --> 45:40.069
but l know who the real brains
behind this operation is.

45:40.779 --> 45:43.156
Yeah? You do?

45:44.658 --> 45:46.534
That's what turns me on about you.

45:47.035 --> 45:48.453
You're so smart.

45:49.455 --> 45:51.205
And those sexy eyes.

45:57.755 --> 45:59.464
Why don't l put some music on?

45:59.548 --> 46:01.382
-Yeah. Music.
-Yeah.

46:05.554 --> 46:07.513
You know, Dwight,

46:07.598 --> 46:10.558
l hear you're the only one
who has the keys to the gate.

46:14.980 --> 46:17.356
That's true. lt is. l'm... Correct.

46:18.150 --> 46:19.358
What if

46:21.028 --> 46:22.904
l wanted to borrow those keys?

46:24.031 --> 46:27.575
Oh, dear sweet God in heaven.

46:29.161 --> 46:31.454
l... Yeah, l can't. l can't.

46:31.538 --> 46:33.706
Come on. Yes, you can, baby.

46:33.791 --> 46:36.292
-No.
-Please? l mean, look.

46:36.376 --> 46:39.170
You help me by giving me the keys,

46:40.088 --> 46:42.173
and l'll help by giving you...

46:42.257 --> 46:44.342
Hey, Hey! Hey! Wait, wait, wait! Whoa!

46:44.760 --> 46:46.886
Hey, l don't need your help, okay, lady?

46:48.180 --> 46:49.597
l can do it myself.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.897
Hey, look! l'm tossing my own salad!

47:12.621 --> 47:15.164
So, this is your secret room.

47:18.085 --> 47:21.879
Well, this just isn't gonna work now, is it?

47:24.800 --> 47:27.468
Professor.

47:29.471 --> 47:31.973
Come over here.

47:37.271 --> 47:40.690
This way, you big hunk.

47:44.236 --> 47:45.611
Have we met?

47:46.405 --> 47:47.738
Follow me.

47:48.824 --> 47:50.366
Are you playing a little game?

47:50.659 --> 47:51.993
Where are you?

47:52.077 --> 47:53.661
Come here, baby.

48:01.044 --> 48:02.086
No!

48:06.633 --> 48:08.050
-ls everybody here?
-Yeah.

48:08.135 --> 48:09.594
All right. Let's go.

48:10.012 --> 48:11.679
Shit, son!

48:15.142 --> 48:18.102
He's not gonna let us out of here!
He's gonna kill us!

48:18.353 --> 48:20.646
Look. A rocket scientist.

48:20.856 --> 48:22.690
All right. Quick.
Everybody to the laboratory.

48:22.774 --> 48:25.318
Move! Come on! Hurry up!

48:25.861 --> 48:27.528
You all are fucked!

48:29.990 --> 48:31.490
Lock the door.

48:33.160 --> 48:34.619
Okay. We have to destroy it.

48:34.703 --> 48:36.954
That's great. How are we gonna destroy
what we can't see?

48:37.164 --> 48:38.414
l got it!

48:38.832 --> 48:42.293
We'll shave off our pubic hairs
and wear the shampoo for two weeks!

48:43.378 --> 48:44.378
No. Listen. Listen.

48:44.671 --> 48:46.130
We're gonna use these guns.

48:46.298 --> 48:49.258
They emit a bolt of concentrated energy,

48:49.343 --> 48:53.179
which can damage the ectoplasmic cells
and destroy the ghost.

48:53.388 --> 48:56.515
Now, there's no more ammunition.
Conserve it. Use it wisely.

48:56.850 --> 48:58.017
Shut up.

49:00.479 --> 49:02.146
Hey! Hey! Hey!

49:02.314 --> 49:03.981
Conserve your ammunition.

49:05.067 --> 49:06.275
My bad.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.945
All right. Now, the only way
we're gonna be able to track these ghosts

49:09.363 --> 49:10.947
is if we're all wearing one of these.

49:11.698 --> 49:14.367
These are thermo goggles.
They work on the principle of body heat.

49:14.534 --> 49:18.329
They're so powerful, they can detect
where any bodily fluids have been,

49:18.413 --> 49:20.039
even if they've been wiped clean.

49:24.336 --> 49:25.419
What?

49:26.964 --> 49:28.464
Are my glasses crooked?

49:29.716 --> 49:32.802
Okay. Now listen,
that ghost may be invisible,

49:32.886 --> 49:34.261
but we have the advantage of being armed

49:34.346 --> 49:37.098
with the most sophisticated
high-tech equipment known to man.

49:37.182 --> 49:38.474
How are we gonna stay
in touch with each other?

49:38.558 --> 49:40.434
l mean, do we have some
walkie-talkies or something?

49:40.644 --> 49:42.311
No. We have these.

49:44.398 --> 49:45.815
Those is Dixie cups.

49:45.941 --> 49:50.778
Well, we kind of ran short of funds
after the guns and the goggles.

49:52.406 --> 49:54.448
All right. Now, let's split up...

49:56.410 --> 49:57.994
Now, wait a minute! Hold up!

49:58.078 --> 49:59.954
How come every time
some scary shit happens

50:00.038 --> 50:01.288
and we need to stick together,

50:01.373 --> 50:03.666
you white people always
say, "Let's split up"?

50:03.750 --> 50:05.292
-Yeah.
-She's right. We should stick together.

50:05.419 --> 50:06.836
Yes! That's what l'm saying!

50:06.920 --> 50:08.087
She's right.

50:08.171 --> 50:10.548
Okay. You three, follow me.

50:17.597 --> 50:19.306
Ain't that a bitch?

50:23.311 --> 50:25.354
We're gonna die, y'all.

50:35.365 --> 50:37.033
-Did you hear that?
-Hell, yeah.

50:38.785 --> 50:40.286
Where's Shorty?

50:40.704 --> 50:42.163
l don't know.

50:42.581 --> 50:43.622
Shorty!

50:43.707 --> 50:46.584
-Shorty!
-Shorty!

50:49.588 --> 50:50.713
Damn.

50:51.840 --> 50:54.550
All right. You wait right here.
l'll be right back.

50:54.634 --> 50:56.135
-Okay.
-All right.

51:05.604 --> 51:07.396
-Wow.
-What is this?

51:07.606 --> 51:09.065
l don't know.

51:10.901 --> 51:13.027
Looks like the furnace room.

51:13.153 --> 51:14.779
-All right. Let's go.
-No, wait.

51:15.030 --> 51:16.197
ln that newspaper article,

51:16.281 --> 51:18.574
it said that Hugh Kane
was killed in the furnace.

51:23.997 --> 51:26.832
Wow. Look at this.

51:27.751 --> 51:29.668
There's so many ashes, Buddy.

51:33.507 --> 51:34.715
What are you doing?

51:34.883 --> 51:36.133
Hold it.

51:44.017 --> 51:45.476
Let's split up. l'll meet you on the other end.

51:45.560 --> 51:47.186
-Okay.
-Wait.

51:48.105 --> 51:49.438
Good luck.

51:50.357 --> 51:51.690
l love you!

52:01.326 --> 52:02.701
-Shorty!
-Cindy!

52:02.828 --> 52:06.163
There's a monster chasing me.
What are we gonna do?

52:06.456 --> 52:07.456
l got it!

52:07.541 --> 52:08.624
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

52:13.046 --> 52:16.215
Shorty!

52:22.722 --> 52:26.225
Damn. Why does that little bitch
got to bring that shit over here?

52:26.685 --> 52:28.936
Okay. Well, maybe she won't see me.

52:29.187 --> 52:30.688
Somebody help me!

52:30.856 --> 52:32.064
Brenda!

52:34.651 --> 52:37.653
Shit, she saw me. Okay. Okay.

52:42.367 --> 52:43.409
Thank you, Lord!

52:46.037 --> 52:49.832
Okay. Now let that shit
just mutilate her white ass and leave.

52:54.588 --> 52:56.463
Damn, bitch, please die!

52:56.965 --> 52:58.257
Oh, my God, Brenda!

52:58.592 --> 52:59.842
We're gonna die!

52:59.926 --> 53:03.554
lt would have just been you
if you had just shut the fuck up!

53:04.181 --> 53:05.181
lt's coming!

53:05.265 --> 53:06.682
What is it?

53:06.766 --> 53:09.393
ls it a monster? ls it a monster?

53:13.398 --> 53:14.565
Cindy?

53:15.859 --> 53:18.277
This is a skeleton. This is bones.

53:18.445 --> 53:20.404
Would you run from Calista Flockhart?

53:23.575 --> 53:24.700
Shut your ass up.

53:28.747 --> 53:30.247
Look. He crazy now.

53:31.124 --> 53:33.500
l'm sorry, Mr. Skeleton. Here.

53:34.878 --> 53:36.045
Gotcha! Psych!

53:36.796 --> 53:37.963
Have a nice trip.

53:42.344 --> 53:44.386
Hey, girl, l got an idea. Come on.

53:46.473 --> 53:48.140
Very funny.

53:54.314 --> 53:55.397
Now, get on out of here!

53:55.607 --> 53:58.192
Somebody gonna catch
an ass-whooping when l come back.

53:58.485 --> 54:00.986
Brenda, you are so brave.

54:01.071 --> 54:03.656
You know, you really are
my best friend, Cindy.

54:03.740 --> 54:04.907
You guys okay?

54:04.991 --> 54:05.950
-Yeah.
-Please.

54:06.034 --> 54:08.702
lt takes more than a little
bag of bones to scare me.

54:08.787 --> 54:09.995
Wedgie!

54:11.665 --> 54:12.915
The ghost has Buddy!

54:13.291 --> 54:14.250
My ass!

54:14.334 --> 54:16.502
-Brenda, do something!
-Okay!

54:19.339 --> 54:21.257
l thought l was your best friend.

54:21.383 --> 54:22.466
Was.

54:22.676 --> 54:24.301
l'm gonna miss you, girl!

54:25.553 --> 54:27.096
Get my gun!

54:40.819 --> 54:42.278
Are you okay?

54:42.904 --> 54:44.738
Oh, my God, you're bleeding.

54:44.823 --> 54:47.116
Come on.
l think there's a first aid kit in the lab.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.534
Come on.

55:05.385 --> 55:07.511
Huey. Baby?

55:09.180 --> 55:10.681
Where are you?

55:14.602 --> 55:17.062
My love? Are you there?

55:19.983 --> 55:21.650
-Huey?
-Oh, no.

55:21.735 --> 55:24.528
Baby! Baby, l got to talk to you.

55:24.612 --> 55:26.739
-No. Go away!
-Baby?

55:28.325 --> 55:30.617
-Get away from me!
-Come on, baby.

55:30.702 --> 55:32.077
We can work this out.

55:34.581 --> 55:38.250
l mean, if we just stick together,
no one can hurt us, my love.

55:38.710 --> 55:40.669
lt was just a booty call!

55:46.551 --> 55:47.968
Why won't you talk to me?

55:48.053 --> 55:50.387
Because you gave me crabs.

55:55.727 --> 55:58.270
You are the weakest link. Goodbye!

56:06.321 --> 56:08.364
Hey. How you doing?

56:21.086 --> 56:22.795
No, no. No kissing. No kissing.

56:25.465 --> 56:28.384
No. Leave this on. Leave this on.
You look beautiful just like that.

56:28.468 --> 56:29.551
Yeah. Yeah.

56:32.389 --> 56:33.806
Shit!

56:37.519 --> 56:38.894
No, no, no.

56:38.978 --> 56:40.646
Don't fuck it up.

56:41.272 --> 56:43.399
Cindy, l've been thinking about
this whole friendship thing.

56:43.942 --> 56:46.443
l've never had a friend
who cared for me the way you do.

56:47.195 --> 56:49.613
l mean, there's Ray,
but he cares for me in a different way,

56:49.697 --> 56:53.367
you know, like bringing me flowers
and running my bath water.

56:53.451 --> 56:55.661
And there's nights when l wake up
screaming and l look over,

56:55.745 --> 56:57.788
and Ray's in my bed holding me.

57:00.458 --> 57:05.170
Anyway, seeing as how tonight may be
our last night together, l was thinking...

57:05.255 --> 57:08.090
That we should take our friendship
a little bit further.

57:08.174 --> 57:09.174
-Yes.
-Buddy,

57:09.259 --> 57:11.176
l was thinking the exact same thing.

57:11.261 --> 57:13.679
l mean, this might be our last night alive,

57:15.056 --> 57:16.932
and l want to take full advantage of it.

57:17.016 --> 57:18.517
l was thinking the same thing!

57:19.144 --> 57:22.271
l want to be able to act out
our innermost fantasies.

57:22.355 --> 57:23.689
Great.

57:24.357 --> 57:28.569
Like, l've always wanted
to walk on the moon.

57:37.745 --> 57:40.205
Buddy!

57:42.584 --> 57:44.710
What about you, Buddy?
What do you want to do?

57:45.712 --> 57:46.879
Well...

57:49.841 --> 57:50.924
He's in here.

58:08.943 --> 58:10.360
Oh, my God. He locked us in.

58:10.445 --> 58:11.487
You should call for help.

58:13.406 --> 58:15.491
Hello! Hello. Can you hear me?

58:16.784 --> 58:18.410
Come in! Come in!

58:18.620 --> 58:20.329
Copy! Do you copy me?

58:21.247 --> 58:24.875
We have a situation here! Breaker!

58:25.919 --> 58:28.587
Oh, my God. They can't hear me!

58:28.963 --> 58:30.964
Must be these walls or something.

58:36.471 --> 58:37.596
Okay.

58:38.806 --> 58:42.059
All right. You stay down here.
l'm gonna go check upstairs.

58:42.769 --> 58:43.769
Okay.

58:53.446 --> 58:54.446
Do you need help or...

58:54.531 --> 58:55.989
-No!
-Okay.

58:56.449 --> 58:57.991
What do l look like to you?

58:58.701 --> 58:59.826
Just trying to be nice.

59:00.078 --> 59:01.912
-Cover me!
-What do you want me to do?

59:01.996 --> 59:03.288
Cover me!

59:03.665 --> 59:06.083
Not literally. l'm serpentining!

59:07.794 --> 59:10.420
They taught me that. Merchant Marines.

59:10.505 --> 59:12.130
Two years.

59:12.215 --> 59:14.383
Spent two years on my belly in Da Nang.

59:14.842 --> 59:16.343
-Yeah.
-Look!

59:16.636 --> 59:18.762
Look. Look what the cripple's doing.

59:19.639 --> 59:20.973
Shit.

59:23.142 --> 59:25.352
Look. l know you're proud, okay?
Well, just let me help you up...

59:25.436 --> 59:27.354
Step it back, candy pants!

59:27.897 --> 59:29.022
Fine.

59:32.610 --> 59:34.152
What are we gonna do?

59:34.696 --> 59:35.737

59:36.698 --> 59:38.490
l can't feel my body, l'm so cold.

59:38.658 --> 59:40.325
Buddy, can you feel this?

59:40.535 --> 59:42.869
No. Try a little higher.

59:43.830 --> 59:45.455
What about that?

59:46.249 --> 59:47.708
Keep rubbing.

59:52.213 --> 59:54.715
-Buddy, l don't think l'm ready...
-Cindy, please!

59:55.008 --> 59:57.676
lt's a matter of life and death.

59:57.760 --> 01:00:01.305
l'm asking you in the name of love.

01:00:05.643 --> 01:00:07.019
Okay, Buddy.

01:00:07.729 --> 01:00:08.854
ln the name of love.

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:21.950
Cindy, l don't know
how much longer l can hold on.

01:00:22.243 --> 01:00:23.785
Don't you say your good-byes.

01:00:24.037 --> 01:00:27.372
You're gonna get out of here,
and you're gonna go on,

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.750
-and you're gonna have lots of little babies.
-Yeah.

01:00:29.834 --> 01:00:32.544
-And you're gonna die an old man...
-Old man.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:34.254
-...warm in his bed.
-Warm in his bed.

01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:35.881
-Not here!
-No.

01:00:36.215 --> 01:00:37.716
-Not like this!
-Amen.

01:00:38.092 --> 01:00:40.344
-Do you understand me?
-Yeah.

01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:43.972
Coming to this house was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:45.223
Me, too.

01:00:45.308 --> 01:00:48.393
And for that l am so thankful.

01:00:48.519 --> 01:00:50.062
-Don't let go.
-Never!

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:51.271

Come on, Kane. Show yourself!

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:17.089
Look. l don't even need my thermal goggles.

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.201
That's right, mother...

01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:58.171
Hey, Kane, you hungry?
How about a little snack of this?

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:04.553
No.

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:14.062
Gotcha!

01:02:26.993 --> 01:02:31.663
l know what you're thinking.
Did l fire three shots or 1 1 7?

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:36.543
Well, do you feel lucky, punk?

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.337
Do you feel lucky?

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:41.339
Do you feel lucky, punk?

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:42.716
Shoot me, motherfucker!

01:02:50.057 --> 01:02:51.433
Okay. Fine.

01:02:51.726 --> 01:02:53.685
Make your best move, ass-bite.

Help!

01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:43.193

01:03:43.903 --> 01:03:45.111
Come on.

01:03:45.363 --> 01:03:47.948
You're gonna fall unless you take my hand.

01:03:48.032 --> 01:03:49.366
No. Give me your other hand.

01:03:49.450 --> 01:03:52.244
No. My other hand isn't strong enough.

01:03:52.578 --> 01:03:53.829
You take my little hand.

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.372
No! Get it away from me!

01:03:55.456 --> 01:03:56.498
Take it!

01:03:56.749 --> 01:03:58.416
Take my hand!

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.804
No. No. Why me?

01:04:10.888 --> 01:04:13.640
No. Come on. No. l've served you well.

01:04:13.724 --> 01:04:16.601
Don't you do this to me.
No, please. Please, no.

01:04:20.606 --> 01:04:23.358
Okay, Buddy.
lt's time for us to get out of here.

01:04:56.976 --> 01:04:59.019
Roger. Roger. Come in, Roger.

01:04:59.145 --> 01:05:00.312
Ray, this is Cindy.

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:02.522
l don't want to talk to Cindy.
l want to talk to Roger.

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:04.566
Roger, where you at, man?
Quit fucking around.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:08.153
Ray, listen. The ghost is close.
He almost got us. Buddy's hurt.

01:05:08.279 --> 01:05:09.487
What's your location?

01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:10.655
l'm right behind you.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.699
Ray, thank God. Okay. Where's Shorty?

01:05:12.783 --> 01:05:16.077

He was here just a minute ago.

01:05:16.412 --> 01:05:18.496
Okay. Listen. You go help Buddy in the lab.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.165
-l'm gonna go check upstairs.
-All right.

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:24.920
That smells good.

01:05:25.588 --> 01:05:26.588
Hello, Cindy.

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:29.841
Say hello to Cindy, Shorty.

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:33.178
Hello, Cindy.

Shorty, are you okay?

01:05:35.181 --> 01:05:36.514
Talk to me!

01:05:37.516 --> 01:05:38.808
Morphine?

01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:41.394
Chloroform? Horse tranquilizers?
You drugged him!

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.855
l did not. That's all his stuff.

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:47.025
All right, Shorty.

01:05:47.151 --> 01:05:48.401
Who's ready for the main course?

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.028
Me! Me.

01:05:50.529 --> 01:05:51.905

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:53.490

01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:57.160
What the fuck?

01:05:57.244 --> 01:05:58.703
Beetlejuice in the house.

01:05:58.829 --> 01:06:00.372
This is your brains on drugs.

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:05.543
Shit, son.

01:06:14.053 --> 01:06:16.179
-Shorty!
-Fucker got me.

01:06:16.889 --> 01:06:18.223
Cindy, what's going on?

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:20.058
lt's Hanson. He's possessed.

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:21.518
Let's get him.

01:07:02.059 --> 01:07:03.101
-Angel style!
-Angel style!

01:07:29.253 --> 01:07:30.253

01:09:23.367 --> 01:09:24.908
l can't feel my legs!

01:09:25.077 --> 01:09:26.161
You never could.

01:09:26.245 --> 01:09:27.578
You stay out of this, all right?

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.288
Now listen.

01:09:29.372 --> 01:09:31.332
You get the others and meet us upstairs.

01:09:31.417 --> 01:09:32.542
-All right?
-Okay.

01:09:32.626 --> 01:09:34.794
You stay here. Ray-Ray, l need your help.

01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:36.045
Give me your belt.

01:09:39.758 --> 01:09:41.091
The Crane.

01:09:45.764 --> 01:09:46.973
The Crouching Tiger.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:53.938
The Drunken Monkey.

01:09:58.152 --> 01:09:59.319
The Mad Cow.

01:10:02.531 --> 01:10:03.740
Motherfucker!

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:08.119
The Camel Toe.

01:10:31.268 --> 01:10:33.186
Get the hell out of there, guys!

01:10:33.562 --> 01:10:34.812
Come on!

01:10:40.444 --> 01:10:41.486
Ray, give me 1 80.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:43.738
Okay. Listen.

01:10:43.822 --> 01:10:45.823
Someone has to go and lure him
onto that platform.

01:10:51.163 --> 01:10:53.289
All right. l'll go.

01:10:53.832 --> 01:10:55.625
-Cindy, let me...
-No, Buddy!

01:10:56.335 --> 01:10:57.502
l'm the one he wants.

01:10:58.379 --> 01:11:00.964
Actually, l was saying
let me have your computer if you die.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:05.969
Okay. But as soon as he gets there,
you have to get off.

01:11:06.345 --> 01:11:07.428
Okay.

01:11:07.638 --> 01:11:08.888
All right, 1 80 me.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.602
Hugh Kane, it's me you want! Come get me!

01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:16.813
l'm not afraid anymore!

01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:18.523
Show yourself!

01:11:40.337 --> 01:11:41.462
Dwight, he's here. Do something.

01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:43.047
l can't. She's still on the platform.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.632
lf l throw the switch, she'll die.

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:46.342
Cindy, get out of there!
You're gonna get killed!

01:11:48.887 --> 01:11:50.013
Move out of the way!

01:11:50.222 --> 01:11:51.222
l'll get her!

01:11:54.268 --> 01:11:55.476
Why is he running so slow?

01:11:55.602 --> 01:11:57.478
Ray! Run faster!

01:11:57.688 --> 01:11:58.730
Okay!

01:11:59.398 --> 01:12:00.648
Throw the switch!

01:12:01.233 --> 01:12:03.693
Now you will be mine. Forever!

01:12:15.622 --> 01:12:17.290
Ray, you saved me.

01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:19.500
Are you okay?

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:21.836
l'm fine. l broke my fall.

01:12:39.897 --> 01:12:41.856
-Yeah!
-Yes!

01:12:44.151 --> 01:12:45.568
-Hey, y'all.
-We made it!

01:12:45.652 --> 01:12:46.652
What's going on?

01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:48.780
Shorty, you made it. You're alive!

01:12:49.281 --> 01:12:52.367
Yeah. We made it!

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:57.872
Yeah. lt was traumatic. lt really was.

01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:00.958
And it's taking me a while to get over it,

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:03.586
but, you know,
now that we're out of the house

01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:05.546
and back in school,

01:13:05.964 --> 01:13:07.799
l just know that everything's gonna be okay.

01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:11.135
Oh, God, will you shut the fuck up?

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:14.013
Why couldn't you have just
left me there to die?

01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:16.265
Give me a fucking rope. l'll hang myself.

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:18.309
Here l go. l'm hanging myself.

01:13:21.522 --> 01:13:24.524
Hello? Hi, Dad.

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:27.068
Are you having fun on your vacation?

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.738
No. Birds are very clean animals.
He's no trouble at all.

01:13:30.864 --> 01:13:33.991
God damn it!
What the fuck did you put in this birdseed?

01:13:39.289 --> 01:13:41.624

-Hey, Buddy!
-Surprise.

01:13:47.548 --> 01:13:48.714
Open chest!

01:13:50.008 --> 01:13:52.343
You got to be quicker than that, pencil dick.

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:54.011
Come on.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.015
Hey, look out. A bee.

01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:01.686
Buddy, l've never had anyone
be so protective of me before.

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:04.021
That's what your man's supposed to do.

01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:05.857
Two hot dogs.

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:11.362
Buddy, get him!

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:13.322

01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:17.493
No! This can't be happening!

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:20.121
lt is happening.

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:22.707
Now we're gonna be together forever.

01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:24.959
No!

01:14:25.544 --> 01:14:27.795
Yes!

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:35.303
Did you hear something?

01:14:35.387 --> 01:14:37.221
No. l didn't hear nothing.
