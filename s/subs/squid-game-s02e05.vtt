18:03.791 --> 18:05.000
So you were born in 1997.

18:05.542 --> 18:07.710
Why do you treat him like he's your boss?

18:07.711 --> 18:09.004
He's the same age as you.

18:09.755 --> 18:12.006
- Nam-su, isn't that right?
- It's Nam-gyu.

18:12.007 --> 18:15.051
- Yes, Nam-gyu. Isn't that right?
- Yes.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.178
You're the same age.
Treat him like a friend.

18:17.179 --> 18:20.057
We'll work better as a team that way.
Okay?

18:21.141 --> 18:21.974
How old are you?

18:21.975 --> 18:23.310
Born in 1998.

18:24.353 --> 18:25.228
You?

18:25.229 --> 18:26.188
Born in 1996.

18:28.232 --> 18:29.066
It's settled.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.654
Gyeong-su is the youngest,
you're the same age, and you're older.

18:35.113 --> 18:37.866
Hey, call her <i>noona</i> since she's older.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.284
[chuckles]

18:40.327 --> 18:42.329
- [Thanos] Do it.
- [Nam-gyu laughs]

18:43.914 --> 18:44.748
<i>Unnie.</i>

18:47.042 --> 18:48.836
Can I ask you something?

18:50.546 --> 18:51.421
Yes.

18:52.130 --> 18:56.343
How did you know it'd be easier
to flip the <i>ddakji</i> with the other side?

19:00.764 --> 19:05.477
I used to play <i>Ddakji</i>
with my friends when I was a kid.

19:06.228 --> 19:09.773
And that was my secret trick.

19:10.941 --> 19:11.983
I see.

19:11.984 --> 19:15.820
Listen, can I ask you something too?

19:15.821 --> 19:16.738
Yes.

19:17.322 --> 19:22.327
When you were playing <i>Jegi,</i>
how come you didn't want us to look?

19:22.870 --> 19:23.829
Oh.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.583
Well, I...

19:28.208 --> 19:31.378
Are you shy?

19:31.962 --> 19:33.463
It's not that.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.800
I'm just not completely done.

19:38.385 --> 19:39.302
What do you mean?

19:39.303 --> 19:42.597
Mom, stop asking questions.
You're being nosy.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.725
- [Yong-sik clears throat]
- [Hyun-ju] It's all right.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.853
I still have some procedures left.

19:49.146 --> 19:53.024
I just didn't want people to stare at me.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.484
What procedures?

19:56.528 --> 19:57.486
[gasps]

19:57.487 --> 20:01.574
Oh, so that's how
you got yourself those too?

20:01.575 --> 20:02.491
[chuckles]

20:02.492 --> 20:04.827
Of course. I knew they were too big--

20:04.828 --> 20:06.245
Mom, please!

20:06.246 --> 20:08.081
[Yong-sik] I'm so sorry.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.921
What? We have more survivors?

20:14.880 --> 20:16.840
It's that nutjob's team.

20:17.925 --> 20:22.220
Goddammit. There's going to be a big drop
in the prize money they add.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.514
- That young lady made it.
- Who?

20:25.515 --> 20:27.642
The tiny young lady.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.645
They don't seem so happy to see us.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.400
That sweet old lady.

20:36.234 --> 20:37.653
I miss my mom.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.955
[PA system chiming]

20:49.623 --> 20:52.333
[woman on PA]
<i>The day's work has been completed.</i>

20:52.334 --> 20:56.797
<i>All soldiers,
please proceed to your quarters.</i>

21:06.723 --> 21:08.725
[door lock clicking]

21:11.979 --> 21:13.730
[ominous music]

21:22.864 --> 21:25.033
- [masked soldier 1 breathing heavily]
- [No-eul grunts]

21:26.076 --> 21:27.076
[masked soldier 2 laughs]

21:27.077 --> 21:31.872
I thought you'd be a total freak,
but you actually have a decent face.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.916
[masked soldier 1]
North Korean girls are pretty.

21:33.917 --> 21:36.168
What the hell is this?
You're breaking the rules.

21:36.169 --> 21:38.045
[masked soldier 2] Rules, my ass.

21:38.046 --> 21:40.673
You should've steered clear
if you weren't going to help.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.384
I'm going to report this.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.389
To whom? The officer?

21:48.015 --> 21:50.891
How long do you think he'll protect you?

21:50.892 --> 21:53.270
He's already cut you loose. [laughs]

21:56.481 --> 21:59.359
Do you want me
to explain it to you in detail?

22:00.402 --> 22:02.278
The situation you're in right now?

22:02.279 --> 22:03.321
[No-eul grunts]

22:03.905 --> 22:05.615
- [No-eul grunts]
- [masked soldier 2 groans]

22:08.035 --> 22:09.619
[both grunting]

22:14.458 --> 22:16.043
[masked soldier 2 grunts]

22:16.877 --> 22:19.212
[masked soldier 1] Fuck. You damn commie.

22:22.966 --> 22:25.510
Shall I ruin your face?

22:28.221 --> 22:31.600
Or shall I cut your fingers off
so you can't pull the trigger anymore?

22:36.229 --> 22:37.355
Last warning.

22:38.356 --> 22:40.317
If you get in our way again,

22:40.901 --> 22:44.571
I will cut off all your fingers
and throw them in the incinerator.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.115
And play with you a little too.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.118
[masked soldier 1 moans]

22:57.125 --> 22:58.126
[door opens]

22:59.795 --> 23:01.712
- [door slams shut]
- [breath trembles]

23:01.713 --> 23:03.757
[gasps]

23:07.803 --> 23:10.138
I'm sorry about earlier, everyone.

23:10.847 --> 23:11.889
[Dae-ho] No, it's okay.

23:11.890 --> 23:12.848
[Gi-hun] Don't be.

23:12.849 --> 23:17.020
If it weren't for you,
I wouldn't have made the last kick.

23:20.023 --> 23:22.567
Player 222, are you feeling all right?

23:23.151 --> 23:24.111
Yes.

23:25.445 --> 23:28.740
Thank you all
for including me on your team.

23:29.658 --> 23:33.160
She smashed that <i>ddakji</i>
and flipped it on her first try.

23:33.161 --> 23:37.331
That was impressive.
She did great, even while carrying a baby.

23:37.332 --> 23:40.167
We were lucky she joined our team.

23:40.168 --> 23:42.878
[Dae-ho] What about
your Flying Stone play?

23:42.879 --> 23:47.925
You hit it with one shot.
With an underhand pitch at that. Bam!

23:47.926 --> 23:49.093
[Dae-ho laughs]

23:49.094 --> 23:51.178
You were like Kim Byung-hyun.

23:51.179 --> 23:52.429
[Jung-bae and Dae-ho laugh]

23:52.430 --> 23:54.975
And you? Was <i>Gong-gi</i>
the only game you ever played?

23:56.351 --> 24:00.062
I could barely see your hand.
It was like a martial arts movie. [laughs]

24:00.063 --> 24:01.730
I'm the only son for two generations.

24:01.731 --> 24:04.817
My mom only let me play at home
with my sisters. [chuckles]

24:04.818 --> 24:08.029
And yet they let their precious son
join the Marines?

24:10.115 --> 24:14.076
My father's idea,
he wanted me to be more of a man.

24:14.077 --> 24:16.495
He fought in the Vietnam War, you see.

24:16.496 --> 24:17.414
[Jung-bae] Wow.

24:17.914 --> 24:19.582
- He sounds like a great man.
- Yeah.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.292
Was he a Marine too?

24:21.293 --> 24:24.671
Yeah, well...
Would you excuse me for a moment?

24:26.673 --> 24:30.343
Listen. Perhaps we should learn
each other's names.

24:30.927 --> 24:34.556
I still don't know your names, gentlemen.
Or yours, Miss.

24:35.640 --> 24:38.018
I'll start. I'm Kang Dae-ho.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.811
"Dae" means "big," "ho" means "tiger."

24:40.812 --> 24:43.898
Wow. "Big tiger." Cool name. [chuckles]

24:43.899 --> 24:45.442
My name is Park Jung-bae.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.860
"Righteous" and "twice."

24:47.861 --> 24:50.905
My parents wanted me
to be twice as righteous.

24:50.906 --> 24:53.033
My name is Kim Jun-hee.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.036
I don't know what it means though.

24:56.995 --> 25:00.706
Jun-hee, when you get out of here,
go see a doctor right away.

25:00.707 --> 25:04.335
You've been under a lot of stress.
You need to get yourself checked out.

25:04.336 --> 25:05.669
Okay.

25:05.670 --> 25:07.504
I'm Oh Young-il.

25:07.505 --> 25:08.715
- [Jung-bae] "Young-il"?
- Yes.

25:10.050 --> 25:12.510
"Young-il" sounds like "zero one,"
and that's my number.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.137
Easy to remember.

25:15.138 --> 25:17.723
Oh, that's true! Your name is your number.

25:17.724 --> 25:18.891
[Dae-ho and Jung-bae laugh]

25:18.892 --> 25:21.852
Oh, Gi-hun. What's your last name?

25:21.853 --> 25:24.647
My name is Seong Gi-hun.

25:24.648 --> 25:25.898
- [In-ho] I see.
- Seong Gi-hun.

25:25.899 --> 25:28.234
[In-ho] "Seong" literally means
"last name."

25:28.235 --> 25:29.527
[In-ho laughs]

25:35.116 --> 25:37.035
[alarm buzzing]

25:44.084 --> 25:47.336
[masked manager]
Congratulations to all of you

25:47.337 --> 25:49.588
for making it through the second game.

25:49.589 --> 25:54.719
Here are the results of the second game.

25:55.887 --> 25:57.973
- [remote beeps]
- [ceiling rumbles]

25:59.474 --> 26:01.184
- [digital trilling]
- [chiptune music]

26:16.616 --> 26:18.243
[chiptune music intensifies]

26:26.251 --> 26:30.255
[masked manager] In the second game,
110 players were eliminated.

26:30.839 --> 26:33.882
The prize money accumulated
up to this point is 20.1 billion won.

26:33.883 --> 26:36.343
Since there are 255 players remaining,

26:36.344 --> 26:41.473
each person's share is 78,823,530 won.

26:41.474 --> 26:42.933
[man 1] Wait, what?

26:42.934 --> 26:46.271
It's still under 100 million?
It's not even 80 million.

26:47.605 --> 26:51.151
[woman] Only 110 people died? Is that all?

26:51.776 --> 26:53.737
Did you count them right?

26:54.362 --> 26:57.823
[man 2] That's all?
But you shot all those people!

26:57.824 --> 27:00.701
- [Yeong-sam] It was more than that!
- [Jeong-dae] Count them again!

27:00.702 --> 27:03.913
Fuck. I almost died twice,
and that's all I get?

27:05.040 --> 27:08.292
I'd get more money than that
if I let somebody beat me up!

27:08.293 --> 27:12.047
[masked manager] I completely understand
your disappointment.

27:12.630 --> 27:17.427
However, we always keep the door open
for you to pursue new opportunities.

27:18.428 --> 27:23.808
You will now take a vote to decide
whether to continue the games or not.

27:33.568 --> 27:39.448
Whether to continue the games
for a bigger prize or to stop here

27:39.449 --> 27:42.410
is entirely your choice.

27:42.994 --> 27:44.912
Please feel free

27:44.913 --> 27:49.417
to exercise your right to choose
in a democratic manner.

27:52.670 --> 27:54.588
- Yong-sik.
- Yeah?

27:54.589 --> 27:56.383
If we go home today,

27:57.425 --> 28:00.386
let's have kimchi stew.
I'll make it with some aged kimchi.

28:00.387 --> 28:03.263
- With a lot of pork, right?
- [Geum-ja chuckles]

28:03.264 --> 28:04.807
I suddenly feel hungry.

28:04.808 --> 28:08.144
Listen, I think it's more than
a coincidence that we met here.

28:08.937 --> 28:14.024
If we get out, I'd like to invite you
to our house for a meal.

28:14.025 --> 28:15.693
We'll grill some pork belly.

28:18.446 --> 28:19.530
Would that be okay?

28:19.531 --> 28:21.698
Absolutely!

28:21.699 --> 28:26.829
We live in a small place, but there is
enough space for four people to eat.

28:26.830 --> 28:30.208
There's space for you to lie down.
You can sleep over. [chuckles]

28:32.794 --> 28:35.880
<i>Unnie,</i> are you coming?

28:49.102 --> 28:51.478
By the way, where do you all live?

28:51.479 --> 28:53.398
We live in Bongcheon-dong.

28:54.149 --> 28:56.483
Really? I live in Sillim-dong.

28:56.484 --> 28:59.778
[gasps] Goodness,
we're practically neighbors!

28:59.779 --> 29:01.990
What about you, Hyun-ju?
Do you live in Seoul?

29:02.574 --> 29:04.116
I live in Gwangmyeong.

29:04.117 --> 29:07.703
My! That's only a 30-minute bus ride away.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.955
I'm surprised we all live
so close together.

29:09.956 --> 29:13.418
We must have a special connection.
This is amazing. [chuckles]

29:27.849 --> 29:29.017
Don't worry.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.144
I want to stop here too.

29:31.895 --> 29:35.440
I should go and be with my wife
at the hospital.

29:38.776 --> 29:41.613
I'm telling you. We'll get out this time.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.282
Damn it.

29:45.074 --> 29:47.827
A Marine should think strategically
and know when to retreat.

29:48.578 --> 29:49.829
Isn't that right, brother?

29:51.080 --> 29:52.915
Yeah, you're right.

29:52.916 --> 29:57.127
Marines aren't invincible.
We should get out.

29:57.128 --> 29:59.589
[Gi-hun] We have to end the games here.

30:00.548 --> 30:03.635
I will help you guys out when we get out.

30:05.011 --> 30:07.805
Please trust me and support this vote.

30:08.389 --> 30:11.809
Guys, all huddle up again.

30:16.773 --> 30:19.733
- In one, two, three. Victory at all costs!
- [all] Victory at all costs!

30:19.734 --> 30:20.652
[Dae-ho] Hmph!

30:22.612 --> 30:23.612
[Jung-bae groans in pain]

30:23.613 --> 30:27.283
[masked manager] This time,
the vote will begin with Player 001.

30:27.867 --> 30:29.869
Player 001, please cast your vote.

30:41.214 --> 30:42.047
[beeps]

30:42.048 --> 30:43.716
[tense music]

30:50.181 --> 30:51.516
[masked manager] Player 006.

31:01.568 --> 31:02.443
[beeps]

31:03.027 --> 31:03.903
Player 007.

31:06.781 --> 31:07.864
Excuse me.

31:07.865 --> 31:08.783
Yong-sik.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.203
Don't get any foolish ideas.

31:13.705 --> 31:15.331
If we put our money together,

31:16.416 --> 31:18.250
it'd be over 150 million.

31:18.251 --> 31:20.378
We'll pay off your debt with it

31:21.170 --> 31:25.757
and use the rest to open
a produce store or something. Okay?

31:25.758 --> 31:26.968
[Yong-sik] Mm-hm.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.282
[beeps]

31:50.033 --> 31:50.867
[gasps]

31:56.539 --> 31:57.498
[breath trembles]

32:13.097 --> 32:13.931
[beeps]

32:15.350 --> 32:16.559
[beeps]

32:22.357 --> 32:25.067
[beeps]

32:25.068 --> 32:28.236
[Seon-nyeo mumbling indistinctly]

32:28.237 --> 32:30.865
[man] Hurry up!
Are you doing a goddamn ritual?

32:34.202 --> 32:35.328
Shut your mouth!

32:39.123 --> 32:43.419
[breathing deeply]

32:48.549 --> 32:50.467
[Seon-nyeo whispering indistinctly]

32:50.468 --> 32:51.594
[beeps]

32:55.723 --> 32:56.849
[beeps]

33:02.313 --> 33:03.272
Don't betray us.

33:03.856 --> 33:04.691
What?

33:05.858 --> 33:07.567
- This.
- [masked manager] Player 048.

33:07.568 --> 33:11.280
We all agreed
to play one more game, right?

33:12.407 --> 33:13.241
Yeah.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.536
[beeps]

33:19.372 --> 33:20.665
[beeps]

33:22.208 --> 33:23.626
[beeps]

33:29.340 --> 33:30.174
[beeps]

33:34.554 --> 33:35.680
[beeps]

33:46.649 --> 33:47.525
[beeps]

33:52.780 --> 33:54.782
[dark music]

33:56.784 --> 33:58.161
[breath trembles]

33:59.412 --> 34:01.497
- [beeps]
- [masked manager] Player 125.

34:23.186 --> 34:24.312
[beeps]

34:27.607 --> 34:28.691
Player 126.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.695
[Gi-hun] Excuse me.

34:33.696 --> 34:34.654
Everyone!

34:34.655 --> 34:36.282
[In-ho] Are you all out of your minds?

34:38.785 --> 34:43.080
You still want to keep going
after watching all those people die?

34:44.415 --> 34:46.375
Who's to say you won't die
in the next game?

34:50.296 --> 34:51.422
We have to stop.

34:52.173 --> 34:53.633
We'll all die if we keep going!

34:54.675 --> 34:57.345
Come to your senses,
and leave with that money.

34:58.554 --> 35:01.682
You've got to survive first,
or there won't be a next step.

35:02.642 --> 35:06.437
What do you think we can do
with a mere 70 million?

35:08.022 --> 35:11.775
I don't know how much you owe,
but for most people here,

35:11.776 --> 35:16.238
that doesn't even cover 10% of their debt.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.573
Am I right?

35:18.407 --> 35:22.244
There's no next step for us!
That money won't change anything!

35:22.245 --> 35:24.746
- [Player 043] Yes, he's right!
- [man 1] That's right!

35:24.747 --> 35:27.959
[Player 043] With that amount of money,
I won't last long.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.545
It was 25 million after the first game,

35:31.337 --> 35:33.421
and now it's 78 million!

35:33.422 --> 35:37.218
After one game,
the amount more than tripled!

35:37.969 --> 35:40.638
If we play one more game,

35:41.556 --> 35:45.476
the prize will be at least 240 million!

35:46.227 --> 35:48.479
[Young-mi] But I can't do this anymore.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.190
[sobbing] Please.

35:52.608 --> 35:55.111
Please let me out of here.

35:56.362 --> 35:57.488
I really...

35:58.948 --> 36:01.951
I really want to go home.

36:02.869 --> 36:05.121
I don't want to die.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.331
[Young-mi crying]

36:09.584 --> 36:10.835
[man 2] Young lady.

36:12.128 --> 36:16.007
You're young, so you'd probably have
another chance.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.884
[sobbing] But I don't.

36:18.885 --> 36:20.719
Please.

36:20.720 --> 36:24.015
[man 2] My family and I have no future.

36:25.558 --> 36:28.768
My business failed,
and now I owe over 500 million.

36:28.769 --> 36:32.398
I've got to make
at least half of that here

36:33.482 --> 36:35.650
if I want a real shot at a fresh start.

36:35.651 --> 36:36.861
[In-ho] What if you die?

36:37.403 --> 36:40.865
If you die here, your family
won't even get your body.

36:41.574 --> 36:44.911
Then it'd be the end
for you and your family!

36:46.954 --> 36:49.290
- Don't you see?
- [Yeong-sam] Don't get fucking scared!

36:50.875 --> 36:53.920
<i>Ddakji,</i> Red Light, Green Light,
Spinning Top!

36:54.545 --> 36:57.048
It's not like the games
are that difficult.

36:58.007 --> 36:58.841
Look.

36:59.800 --> 37:04.096
There are still 255 players.
Way more than half of us survived!

37:04.764 --> 37:08.309
We've made it this far,
so let's do this one more time!

37:09.018 --> 37:12.062
[Jeong-dae] You make such a good point,
young man.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.022
That's right!

37:13.731 --> 37:18.235
We've all played the games well
and survived until now!

37:19.070 --> 37:21.364
Now, let's play one more game!

37:22.281 --> 37:27.077
Just one more, and that's it.
Let's play just one more game!

37:27.078 --> 37:28.954
- [ominous music]
- Yeah, let's play one more!

37:28.955 --> 37:30.246
[Jeong-dae] One more game!

37:30.247 --> 37:35.252
[players] One more game!

38:19.380 --> 38:20.339
[beeps]

38:24.218 --> 38:28.138
[masked manager] The results are
139 for O and 116 for X.

38:28.139 --> 38:33.561
Based on the majority vote,
we'll proceed to the third game tomorrow.

38:34.270 --> 38:35.770
Thank you.

38:35.771 --> 38:37.815
[players chatter indistinctly]

38:42.361 --> 38:43.279
[sighs]

39:25.279 --> 39:26.197
Thank you.

39:28.491 --> 39:29.325
Thank you.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.132
<i>Noona.</i>

39:48.469 --> 39:50.386
Aren't you scared?

39:50.387 --> 39:51.305
Scared of what?

39:52.389 --> 39:54.475
Playing more games.

39:57.311 --> 39:58.187
I am scared.

40:00.564 --> 40:02.858
Then why do you want to continue?

40:05.361 --> 40:06.278
Hmm.

40:07.655 --> 40:09.740
Because if I go out now,

40:10.908 --> 40:12.827
I'll have to face even scarier things.

40:17.665 --> 40:18.499
[chuckles]

40:19.375 --> 40:21.042
Don't call me <i>noona.</i>

40:21.043 --> 40:23.462
I'm younger than you,
but don't tell those jerks.

40:31.554 --> 40:34.806
Mom, are you angry?

40:34.807 --> 40:36.892
Don't call me "Mom," you damn fool.

40:38.102 --> 40:42.731
Mom, I'm sorry,
but I can't go home with just that.

40:49.738 --> 40:50.781
What do you mean?

40:53.159 --> 40:55.536
I have a little more debt.

40:59.832 --> 41:00.708
How much?

41:01.667 --> 41:03.294
About 100 million.

41:05.504 --> 41:08.841
[sniffles] I borrowed it from loan sharks
and the gambling den.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.760
If I don't pay them back by next month,

41:13.053 --> 41:14.138
I'll be in huge trouble.

41:15.598 --> 41:20.477
They said they'd take and sell
my eyes, liver, and kidneys.

41:21.061 --> 41:22.687
I know they'll actually do it.

41:22.688 --> 41:26.317
That's why
I haven't been able to come home.

41:26.817 --> 41:27.651
[sighs]

41:28.152 --> 41:33.031
Just one more game.
Next time, I promise I'll vote to leave.

41:33.032 --> 41:35.783
After one more game,
I'll be able to pay off all my debts.

41:35.784 --> 41:37.786
We'll make a fresh start then. Okay?

41:39.330 --> 41:41.539
Yong-sik. "Next time"?

41:41.540 --> 41:42.624
Yeah.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.210
"Fresh start"?

41:44.919 --> 41:46.378
[sighs]

41:47.671 --> 41:51.926
What if one of us gets killed before that?

41:53.344 --> 41:54.678
I know...

41:55.804 --> 41:58.766
maybe you'd be fine without me.

42:02.102 --> 42:04.939
But if something happens to you...

42:08.317 --> 42:12.655
I wouldn't have a reason to live,
even if I make it out of here.

42:14.949 --> 42:16.616
Why would you say such a thing?

42:16.617 --> 42:19.536
We'll get through this together.

42:20.537 --> 42:21.372
[sighs]

42:26.502 --> 42:27.336
Brother!

42:28.087 --> 42:29.712
[stifled cough]

42:29.713 --> 42:30.965
[Dae-ho] Brother Jung-bae!

42:32.132 --> 42:33.049
[whimpers]

42:33.050 --> 42:35.302
- Man...
- [whimsical music]

42:37.054 --> 42:39.222
[Dae-ho] Hey, just come back here.

42:39.223 --> 42:42.225
- No, I'm good here.
- [Dae-ho] Oh, come on.

42:42.226 --> 42:44.769
- [Jung-bae] But... Hey.
- [Dae-ho] All right.

42:44.770 --> 42:46.771
You should've gone farther away then.

42:46.772 --> 42:50.025
It bugs me seeing you
sitting there all pathetic.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.198
[Jung-bae] I'm sorry.

42:58.325 --> 42:59.702
Jun-hee, Young-il. I'm sorry.

43:02.454 --> 43:03.455
Gi-hun, I'm sorry.

43:05.958 --> 43:07.750
I borrowed some emergency cash,

43:07.751 --> 43:10.420
and the creditors are harassing
my ex-wife and kid.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.047
If I play one more game,

43:13.048 --> 43:15.258
I think I'll be able to settle my debt.

43:15.259 --> 43:16.801
- So--
- [In-ho] Jung-bae.

43:16.802 --> 43:19.680
You of all people shouldn't have done it.

43:21.015 --> 43:22.433
It's not twice as righteous.

43:25.185 --> 43:26.060
[sighs]

43:26.061 --> 43:29.898
But, looking at the results,
even if you had voted against,

43:30.482 --> 43:32.275
we would still have been outvoted.

43:32.276 --> 43:35.695
Right? It's not entirely my fault.

43:35.696 --> 43:36.989
All right. To be honest,

43:38.490 --> 43:40.743
I understand why you did it.

43:41.577 --> 43:44.830
The money isn't enough for me either,
so when I went up to vote,

43:45.622 --> 43:47.790
I did think about playing one more game.

43:47.791 --> 43:48.708
You did?

43:48.709 --> 43:50.002
I said I get it.

43:51.211 --> 43:53.004
Thank you for understanding.

43:53.005 --> 43:57.175
[sighs] But I voted in favor
partly because I feel confident.

43:57.176 --> 43:59.595
We did so well as a team, didn't we?

44:00.220 --> 44:04.099
If we stick together one more time,
I'm sure we'll be fine. Jun-hee.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.726
I'll make sure we survive the next game--

44:06.727 --> 44:07.853
[Gi-hun] "The next game"?

44:09.730 --> 44:10.981
In the next game,

44:11.899 --> 44:14.068
we might have to kill each other.

44:16.653 --> 44:19.198
[In-ho] Gi-hun, that's a bit much.

44:20.240 --> 44:24.370
There's nothing we can do now,
so let's try to stay positive.

44:25.120 --> 44:29.541
We should eat, pull ourselves together,
and try our best again.

44:30.542 --> 44:34.129
Here, Jun-hee. You can have mine too.
Hang in there until the next game.

44:34.963 --> 44:36.631
- No, it's okay.
- [In-ho] Take it.

44:36.632 --> 44:39.385
I don't drink plain milk.

44:43.555 --> 44:44.722
Thank you.

44:44.723 --> 44:46.057
[Jung-bae] Have my bread too.

44:46.058 --> 44:47.851
I don't deserve to eat.

44:49.186 --> 44:50.729
Can I have your milk then?

44:52.022 --> 44:54.024
[whimsical music]

45:03.700 --> 45:06.119
[Yong-sik] It wasn't just me.

45:06.120 --> 45:10.082
Oh, look. See?
I'm not the only one who voted in favor--

45:16.588 --> 45:18.382
Hyun-ju, why did you do it?

45:18.882 --> 45:21.592
We said we were all going
to get together at my house.

45:21.593 --> 45:24.178
Why did you change your mind?

45:24.179 --> 45:28.142
Mmm? I wouldn't think you'd have
gambling debts like my son.

45:29.351 --> 45:33.647
Is it because of the surgery?
Does it cost that much?

45:35.941 --> 45:36.983
[sighs]

45:36.984 --> 45:39.611
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

45:40.696 --> 45:42.905
I can't even keep
my own child under control,

45:42.906 --> 45:47.202
so who am I to tell you anything?

45:48.829 --> 45:49.872
[sighs]

45:54.877 --> 45:55.711
[Hyun-ju] I...

46:00.174 --> 46:02.676
Everything was fine
until I told people who I really am.

46:04.178 --> 46:06.722
People would look at me strangely,

46:07.764 --> 46:09.600
but I never had any big issues.

46:11.810 --> 46:12.644
But...

46:14.688 --> 46:16.898
once I told people
I wanted to live as a woman...

46:16.899 --> 46:18.191
[melancholy music]

46:18.192 --> 46:19.735
and started transitioning,

46:21.195 --> 46:22.529
everything changed.

46:29.703 --> 46:31.163
My mom cried a lot.

46:33.123 --> 46:34.875
And my father stopped talking to me.

46:37.920 --> 46:41.632
I got fired from my job,
and lost all my friends.

46:43.425 --> 46:45.677
I wasn't done
with the treatment and procedures,

46:47.429 --> 46:50.390
but I wasn't earning any money,
so my debt kept piling up.

46:51.183 --> 46:52.976
Although I felt liberated,

46:54.394 --> 46:55.312
my life...

46:57.189 --> 46:58.689
became so much harder.

46:58.690 --> 47:00.150
[Geum-ja] Oh, dear.

47:01.944 --> 47:06.949
Well, what did you do for work before?

47:08.909 --> 47:09.826
I was in the army.

47:10.702 --> 47:11.995
[Geum-ja] Ah...

47:13.455 --> 47:17.208
If you make money here, then what?

47:17.209 --> 47:18.877
Do you have a plan?

47:20.170 --> 47:22.255
I think I'm going to move to Thailand.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.257
Thailand?

47:23.840 --> 47:28.637
I want to play just one more game.
If I win the money... [sniffles]

47:30.138 --> 47:33.809
I'll finish my transition there
and buy a small house.

47:35.102 --> 47:36.811
I want to start a new life there.

47:36.812 --> 47:38.854
I've been to Thailand before.

47:38.855 --> 47:41.983
There are a lot of people
like Hyun-ju over there.

47:41.984 --> 47:46.779
They're hotter and more beautiful
than most women,

47:46.780 --> 47:49.991
and you see them everywhere.
Isn't that right?

47:49.992 --> 47:54.663
Yeah. I hear a lot of them
are really beautiful.

47:56.081 --> 47:57.958
You're beautiful too, <i>unnie</i>.

48:10.178 --> 48:11.345
[breath trembling]

48:11.346 --> 48:14.975
I don't know if I could say "beautiful,"

48:15.892 --> 48:17.603
but I've spent some time with you now,

48:19.646 --> 48:22.189
and I think you look fine. [laughs]

48:22.190 --> 48:24.359
[Yong-sik] You said she was unsightly.

48:26.653 --> 48:27.571
[Geum-ja] Hey.

48:28.280 --> 48:29.114
[Geum-ja laughs]

48:29.781 --> 48:33.075
[toilet flushing]

48:33.076 --> 48:34.995
[trickling]

48:35.912 --> 48:36.872
[sighs]

48:41.418 --> 48:43.086
You traitor.

48:43.670 --> 48:46.256
How can you take a piss
under these circumstances?

48:47.716 --> 48:49.300
[urinal flushing]

48:49.301 --> 48:53.013
Just finish. You'll get an infection
if you stop mid-stream.

48:55.182 --> 48:56.058
[Nam-gyu sighs]

49:07.653 --> 49:09.695
[Thanos] Were you really
trying to get out?

49:09.696 --> 49:11.657
What can you even do with 70 million?

49:13.158 --> 49:15.369
That's not even enough to pay me back.

49:16.953 --> 49:18.747
You need to pay me back, and also

49:19.539 --> 49:22.249
compensate for the damage
you did to my soul.

49:22.250 --> 49:26.170
How many times do I have to tell you?
That coin's price did go up.

49:26.171 --> 49:28.673
You held out for more cash
but didn't sell at the right time.

49:28.674 --> 49:30.966
And I have the freedom
to decide if I want to leave.

49:30.967 --> 49:33.302
[Nam-gyu] I don't care
for your fucking tone.

49:33.303 --> 49:36.222
Hey, should I just rip his mouth off?

49:36.223 --> 49:38.058
You have the <i>freedom?</i>

49:38.809 --> 49:40.434
- You don't have such a thing.
- Goddammit.

49:40.435 --> 49:43.062
You're my slave until you pay me back.

49:43.063 --> 49:44.605
[in English] My slave.

49:44.606 --> 49:47.775
[in Korean] So you have to keep playing
the games until the end.

49:47.776 --> 49:48.860
And who knows?

49:50.195 --> 49:52.072
You might win the entire prize alone.

49:53.198 --> 49:55.783
[rapping]

49:55.784 --> 49:59.537
<i>♪ And you will get your happiness back ♪</i>

49:59.538 --> 50:02.999
If I won the prize alone,
that'd mean you're dead.

50:03.500 --> 50:05.752
Why would I pay you back if you were dead?

50:06.753 --> 50:09.089
How do you even remember your lyrics?

50:09.756 --> 50:11.216
Oh, right.

50:11.800 --> 50:14.343
You forgot the lyrics
in the show's finale.

50:14.344 --> 50:16.721
You son of a bitch. You have a death wish?

50:16.722 --> 50:18.724
[Jung-bae] I didn't even eat anything,
so why...

50:24.521 --> 50:25.397
[Myung-gi grunts]

50:27.858 --> 50:29.401
[Thanos in English] I'm watching you.

50:34.990 --> 50:36.658
Are those guys still bullying you?

50:37.367 --> 50:40.327
If they keep doing that,
you can ask for our help.

50:40.328 --> 50:41.288
I'm fine.

50:45.167 --> 50:46.084
[Dae-ho sighs]

50:49.755 --> 50:51.757

Go under.

51:06.563 --> 51:07.397
[Jung-bae grunts]

51:09.483 --> 51:13.444
Is this really necessary?
I don't like sleeping under there.

51:13.445 --> 51:17.114
Once the lights go out,
somebody might attack us.

51:17.115 --> 51:19.033
What? Who?

51:19.034 --> 51:21.578
The prize money still goes up
if we kill each other.

51:22.412 --> 51:24.164
It's part of the game they designed.

51:24.915 --> 51:27.249
[In-ho] Gi-hun,
I think you're overreacting here.

51:27.250 --> 51:29.836
Even if that were true,
people wouldn't do that.

51:30.504 --> 51:32.047
In the previous games,

51:32.964 --> 51:35.717
dozens of people
killed each other at night.

51:37.177 --> 51:38.052
Right here.

51:38.053 --> 51:39.261
[dark music]

51:39.262 --> 51:40.930
You have no idea

51:40.931 --> 51:42.808
how people can change...

51:44.935 --> 51:46.603
in this place.

51:48.146 --> 51:53.026
All right, I guess I didn't know
what I was talking about. I'm sorry.

51:56.613 --> 51:59.282
[Gi-hun] Once it's lights out,
we need to take turns keeping watch.

52:00.534 --> 52:03.870
I'll take the first watch.
You should decide the order for the rest.

52:26.643 --> 52:28.310
[Yong-sik] Where are you going?

52:28.311 --> 52:30.980
[Geum-ja] To the bathroom.

52:30.981 --> 52:32.106
[Yong-sik sighs]

52:32.107 --> 52:35.402
You always go to the bathroom
in the middle of the night.

52:37.404 --> 52:38.445
Should I come with you?

52:38.446 --> 52:43.492
No. Why would you want to come
to the ladies' room?

52:43.493 --> 52:45.369
Will you be okay alone?

52:45.370 --> 52:50.292
I'm a little scared of the people here.

52:57.549 --> 52:58.675
Look.

53:04.055 --> 53:05.347
Whoa.

53:05.348 --> 53:07.349
- What...
- Listen.

53:07.350 --> 53:10.312
This is the <i>binyeo</i>
your grandmother gave me.

53:11.146 --> 53:14.733
I put it in just in case
I need to protect myself.

53:15.442 --> 53:18.862
If somebody messes with me, I'll just go...

53:20.655 --> 53:21.489
Of course.

53:22.699 --> 53:25.994
Madam Jang Geum-ja,
who survived the Korean War.

53:28.079 --> 53:29.204
Very impressive, ma'am.

53:36.046 --> 53:36.963
[Jun-hee] Mr. Seong.

53:40.133 --> 53:41.551
I need to use the bathroom.

53:42.135 --> 53:44.387
It's too dangerous to go by yourself.

53:45.805 --> 53:47.015
[Geum-ja] We can go together.

54:01.947 --> 54:04.281
We need to use the bathroom.

54:04.282 --> 54:07.076
[masked soldier] No. Entry and exit
are restricted at this time.

54:07.077 --> 54:11.080
Please. I'm not feeling very well.

[masked soldier] No. Entry and exit
are restricted at this time.

54:14.000 --> 54:14.918
[Geum-ja] Look.

54:16.127 --> 54:17.128
Mr. Triangle.

54:17.837 --> 54:23.176
Even though you're wearing a weird mask,
you're still human, aren't you?

54:23.969 --> 54:28.138
In the outside world,
you might have a sister like her

54:28.139 --> 54:30.433
and a mom like me.

54:31.059 --> 54:34.853
When ladies say
they need to use the bathroom,

54:34.854 --> 54:38.691
it's for reasons they can't tell you.

54:38.692 --> 54:40.985
If you can't understand that,

54:40.986 --> 54:45.197
you shouldn't even call yourself human.
You really shouldn't. [chuckles]

- [melancholy music]

54:51.913 --> 54:55.332
Ever since I entered my 60s,
I've had bladder control issues.

54:55.333 --> 54:58.293
I can't go out without wearing a diaper,

54:58.294 --> 55:01.213
but I couldn't bring
any of the things I need here.

55:01.214 --> 55:04.759
Do you really have to make me wet myself?

55:05.427 --> 55:09.263
Imagine if I was your mother,
Mr. Triangle.

55:09.264 --> 55:12.017
You wouldn't do that to your mother.

55:12.976 --> 55:15.853
I came here because of my son's debt.

55:15.854 --> 55:18.606
I should at least get to pee
when I want, shouldn't I?

55:19.232 --> 55:22.609
[sobbing] What did I do
in my previous life to deserve...

55:22.610 --> 55:23.820
[music stops]

55:25.780 --> 55:27.574
Well, thank you.

55:28.700 --> 55:30.659
Can I come too?

55:30.660 --> 55:32.369
[Geum-ja] Oh, that's okay.

55:32.370 --> 55:35.206
She's a woman. Her name is Hyun-ju.

55:36.041 --> 55:37.959
It's fine. Let's go.

Come quick. [chuckles]

55:41.046 --> 55:43.590
Thank you, Mr. Triangle.

Hold on to me if you need help.

55:54.184 --> 55:55.226
I'm okay.

55:59.522 --> 56:01.774
In a place like this in your condition...

56:01.775 --> 56:04.778
Your mom and dad must be worried sick.

56:05.862 --> 56:07.655
[sighs] I don't have any.

56:09.449 --> 56:10.575
I have no parents.

56:21.252 --> 56:22.295
[Geum-ja] Listen.

56:22.879 --> 56:25.715
If you need help with anything,
just let me know.

56:28.176 --> 56:29.385
I'm okay.

56:34.766 --> 56:37.352
Is she sick or something?

I think she's almost due.

[Jung-bae grunts]

57:10.051 --> 57:12.220
You should get some sleep. I'll take over.

57:12.887 --> 57:14.305
I'm not that tired.

57:15.682 --> 57:17.308
Get some more sleep.

57:27.902 --> 57:29.946
[sighs] I'm sorry.

57:30.864 --> 57:32.198
Let's not talk about it.

57:33.825 --> 57:35.243
I know it wasn't your fault.

57:36.494 --> 57:37.829
No, it's not about that.

57:42.250 --> 57:46.171
I'm sorry I didn't lend you money
when you came to my pub before.

57:48.464 --> 57:52.427
If I had found some way to help you,
your mom might still be alive now.

57:53.678 --> 57:56.598
Man, but I really
didn't have any money then.

57:58.016 --> 57:58.892
[sighs]

58:00.685 --> 58:01.561
I know.

58:03.271 --> 58:05.023
I've never resented you for that.

58:07.483 --> 58:10.778
Is that why you came here before?
To pay for your mom's treatment?

58:16.618 --> 58:19.454
So why did you come back?

58:20.205 --> 58:23.498
If I were you,
I would have put everything behind me

58:23.499 --> 58:25.293
and started a new life with the money.

58:29.464 --> 58:30.506
If...

58:33.635 --> 58:35.720
I died right before your eyes,

58:38.097 --> 58:39.182
and you...

58:40.767 --> 58:42.143
won all the money,

58:43.561 --> 58:44.979
how would you feel?

58:47.482 --> 58:50.359
Come on, don't say that.
We'll make it out together.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.445
That's why I came back.

58:54.113 --> 58:55.949
To make it out with everyone.

58:57.617 --> 58:59.118
To end this game.

- But

59:04.207 --> 59:05.959
I don't know anymore.

59:08.670 --> 59:11.089
I don't know what more I can do here.

59:12.465 --> 59:16.760
[sighs] I ruined your plan
by pressing that button.

59:16.761 --> 59:18.638
I told you it's not your fault.

59:24.394 --> 59:27.980
[Jung-bae] Hey, do you remember
when we went on strike?

59:27.981 --> 59:31.901
We were occupying the factory,
and management told us to come out.

59:32.402 --> 59:34.821
They said anyone who came out voluntarily

59:36.030 --> 59:38.866
would be let off the hook
and receive more severance pay.

59:39.534 --> 59:41.244
How could I forget?

59:42.537 --> 59:46.249
When I was on night watch,
I wanted to go out. Guess why I didn't.

59:47.125 --> 59:51.546
You were sleeping beside me,
and you were talking in your sleep.

59:53.214 --> 59:55.758
"Mom, I'm hungry. Give me some food."

59:56.759 --> 59:59.052
"Mom, I'm hungry. Give me some food."

59:59.053 --> 01:00:01.848
You were sobbing in your sleep.

01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:09.896
- I cried in my sleep?
- Yes.

01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:11.023
Asking for food?

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:11.982
Yeah.

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.692
So you stayed because of me?

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:18.197
Yeah. I was watching you, and I thought,

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:22.784
"Man, look at this poor little wuss."

01:00:22.785 --> 01:00:25.245
"If he wakes up and sees that I'm gone,

01:00:25.246 --> 01:00:28.374
he'll start crying and won't even
be able to go the bathroom."

01:00:29.334 --> 01:00:31.626
Then I knew I couldn't fucking leave you.

01:00:31.627 --> 01:00:34.004
You're so full of shit.

01:00:34.005 --> 01:00:35.380
No, I swear on your mom.

01:00:35.381 --> 01:00:37.674
Why on my mom? Swear on your own.

01:00:37.675 --> 01:00:39.801
Whoever's mom it is, it's true.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:43.138
I got fired and ended up like this
because I stayed.

01:00:43.139 --> 01:00:46.142
You always blame me
for every bad thing that happens,

01:00:47.143 --> 01:00:50.520
losing money on the horses
and for your failed chicken shop.

01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:51.855
What else? Getting married?

01:00:51.856 --> 01:00:54.816
No, I got married because I wanted to.
I got divorced because of you.

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.569
Hey, I got divorced because of you.

01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.988
Because you'd always
invite me out for drinks.

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:02.574
And you're the one
who got me into horse racing.

01:01:02.575 --> 01:01:05.452
All right. Quiet down.

01:01:05.453 --> 01:01:07.079

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:11.209
You're finally acting
like the Seong Gi-hun I know. [laughs]

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:16.005
You've been acting
like a different person.

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:22.261
Gi-hun.

01:01:23.679 --> 01:01:28.810
After the next game,
let's get out of here, okay?

Let's go drink soju like old times.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:37.068
You're buying.

[sighs] People really don't change, huh?

01:01:45.243 --> 01:01:47.954
Seong Gi-hun,
the cheapskate of Ssangmun-dong.

The biggest cheapskate.

Is she still in there?

Yes.

Oh, dear. What's wrong?

Are you in pain? Is your belly hurting?

Oh, no. Your baby must be coming.

Listen, tell me where and how it hurts.

It's okay.

You and your baby
are going to be all right.

Don't worry.

[mercenaries] Yes, sir.

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:50.535
Captain Park, be careful out there.

01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:59.167
Team 2 will search up north.
We'll head out far to the southwest.

01:03:59.168 --> 01:04:00.293
Okay.

01:04:00.294 --> 01:04:02.337
We have to find it in the next four days.

01:04:02.338 --> 01:04:03.339
[Captain] Don't worry.

01:04:03.965 --> 01:04:07.677
Captain Ko over there is a local too.
He knows the area inside and out.

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:11.681
And we've got enough fuel
and food for a week.

01:04:12.306 --> 01:04:13.807
- Let's give it a go.
- All right.

01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:15.434
[Kim] You've got some soju too, right?

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:20.146
I'll catch some fish with this at night.
You can slice it up nicely for us.

01:04:20.147 --> 01:04:22.525
[Captain] Hey, do you think
you're on a fishing boat?

01:04:23.442 --> 01:04:27.445
Stay on your toes
until we find that island.

01:04:27.446 --> 01:04:28.489

When it gets dark,
we won't be able to do anything anyway.

01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.620
What are we supposed to do all night?

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:38.583
Are you going to sing and dance for us?

01:04:44.589 --> 01:04:46.131
[Woo-seok] All right, let's set sail!

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:49.884
The team that finds it first
gets a bonus! Good luck!

01:04:49.885 --> 01:04:52.262

- [mercenary 2] Good luck!

[Nam-gyu] Hey, brother.
Can I have one too?

01:05:25.796 --> 01:05:27.589
[Player 380] You don't want to know.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:29.842
Once you take it,
you'll never be normal again.

01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:34.764
If you get out of here,
don't get involved with them ever again.

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.934
Why did you team up with them then?

01:05:39.935 --> 01:05:42.980
Because idiots like them
are easier to deal with.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:47.652
What about me?
Why did you team up with me?

01:05:49.111 --> 01:05:50.237
Because...

01:05:51.947 --> 01:05:53.699
I thought you wouldn't deceive me.

01:05:54.492 --> 01:05:55.326
What?

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:56.994
[chuckles]

01:05:58.496 --> 01:06:02.375
Anyway, I'm getting out
once the prize money reaches 200 million.

01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:05.711
I don't know your situation,
but think carefully.

01:06:08.464 --> 01:06:10.383
You won't last long in here.

It's okay.

01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:27.418

01:08:12.671 --> 01:08:16.299
<i>You must form groups of that size,</i>

<i>go into the rooms,
and close the door within 30 seconds.</i>

01:08:19.845 --> 01:08:23.264
[Jung-bae] Oh, this game? We used to play
something similar on school trips.

01:08:23.265 --> 01:08:24.808
We formed groups by hugging.

01:08:24.809 --> 01:08:27.602
[Dae-ho] Yeah. Instead of hugging,
we go into those rooms.

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:29.354
[Geum-ja] I know this game.

01:08:29.355 --> 01:08:32.608
How should we play this?
Is there a strategy?

01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:36.110
If the number is four,
we can stay together.

01:08:36.111 --> 01:08:38.613
If it's two, you and me pair up.

01:08:38.614 --> 01:08:42.450
If the number is bigger than five,
we'll get the additional people we need.

01:08:42.451 --> 01:08:45.412
But what if it's smaller than five?

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:48.206
Like three or four.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:50.542
We'll figure it out as we go.

01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:53.586
No matter what happens, don't panic.
Let's stay calm.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:54.838
