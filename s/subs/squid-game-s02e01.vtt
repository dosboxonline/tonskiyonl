WEBVTT

00:25.734 --> 00:27.527
Where do you think you're going?

00:29.070 --> 00:30.530
You've got no place to go.

00:39.748 --> 00:44.169
Don't hide like a sneaky little rat.
Show yourself.

00:44.252 --> 00:46.296
You should have gotten on that plane.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.507
You will regret your decision.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.510
I'm going to find you.

00:53.470 --> 00:55.305
No matter what it takes.

01:07.150 --> 01:08.568
Where to, sir?

01:13.865 --> 01:15.325
To Seoul, please.

01:15.950 --> 01:16.910
All right.

02:28.189 --> 02:29.440
I'm sorry, but…

02:32.652 --> 02:34.612
could you give me five minutes?

03:15.612 --> 03:16.738
Jun-ho.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.035
Jun-ho, can you hear me?

03:24.662 --> 03:28.583
Doctor! I need a doctor in here!

03:28.666 --> 03:31.628
My son just opened his eyes!

03:33.296 --> 03:34.505
In-ho.

03:43.514 --> 03:47.352
SQUID GAME 2

03:49.604 --> 03:53.733
EPISODE 1
BREAD AND LOTTERY

03:54.901 --> 03:57.570
2 YEARS LATER

04:07.956 --> 04:09.040
What the hell?

04:09.874 --> 04:12.961
You're not wearing a helmet.
Your license, please.

04:13.044 --> 04:16.631
Damn it. Isn't this entrapment?

04:16.714 --> 04:18.800
Hiding to catch people is shady.

04:18.883 --> 04:21.261
You want to squeeze money
out of broke citizens?

04:21.344 --> 04:22.345
Your license, please.

04:25.765 --> 04:26.766
Hold on.

04:27.684 --> 04:31.229
Look, can't you just let us go?
I'm wearing one.

04:31.980 --> 04:32.939
No, ma'am.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.944
Hey, you're really hot.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.863
I could charge you with obstruction.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.532
You're a tough cookie.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.958
Come on, get in here.

04:54.919 --> 04:56.296
Damn, great picture.

04:56.379 --> 04:59.549
The fine for not wearing a helmet
is 20,000 won. Pay it on time.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.426
Hey, can I post this picture online?

05:01.509 --> 05:03.803
Are you on Instagram?
Let's follow each other!

05:05.179 --> 05:06.389
Where are you going?

05:06.472 --> 05:09.058
Hey! Where are you going? What about me?

05:10.310 --> 05:13.771
You can ask that stupid pig
for a ride in his patrol car!

05:15.315 --> 05:17.483
Hey!

05:17.567 --> 05:19.277
You asshole!

05:19.360 --> 05:20.278
Damn it!

05:22.488 --> 05:23.614
Hwang Jun-ho!

05:26.701 --> 05:30.163
Is this why you transferred here?
To be called a "stupid pig"?

05:31.205 --> 05:32.540
Chief.

05:34.125 --> 05:36.002
Do you like vinegar on these?

05:37.170 --> 05:39.839
It's been so long, I can't quite remember.

05:40.506 --> 05:44.677
Jun-ho, stop wasting your time out here.
Come back to the Major Crimes Division.

05:44.761 --> 05:48.431
Wait, not on the onions.
Just on the pickled radish, right?

05:49.766 --> 05:53.061
For God's sake, are you still brooding?

05:53.144 --> 05:55.772
Look, I've tried.

05:55.855 --> 05:58.232
I've made enough appeals
to the authorities,

05:58.316 --> 06:00.651
and I had the coast guard
search the area for days.

06:00.735 --> 06:03.905
I know. Just eat your noodles
before they get soggy.

06:04.822 --> 06:05.823
Listen.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.160
I want to believe you.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.453
No, I do believe you.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.539
But we never got those photos
you said you sent.

06:13.623 --> 06:17.377
Your phone is at the bottom of the sea,
and you don't know where that island is.

06:18.628 --> 06:21.631
Those games you said you saw,
where people got killed?

06:21.714 --> 06:24.175
I've tried to make
the higher-ups believe it,

06:24.717 --> 06:27.428
but there's just not enough evidence.

06:27.512 --> 06:31.641
The only evidence is
the untraceable bullet in your shoulder.

06:32.475 --> 06:36.687
And let me remind you, smart-ass.
You went rogue with a gun

06:36.771 --> 06:39.816
and suddenly turned up at death's door.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.734
I haven't told you this before,

06:42.318 --> 06:44.237
but when you woke up,

06:44.320 --> 06:47.615
they were ready to fire you,
and I went out of my way to stop them.

06:47.698 --> 06:49.409
Right, thank you.

06:49.492 --> 06:53.246
I'll be forever indebted to you, sir.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.790
You sarcastic little shit.

06:55.873 --> 06:58.543
Look, we're the police.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.963
Firemen fight fire with water,
and the police--

07:02.046 --> 07:04.215
"Fight crime with evidence."

07:05.550 --> 07:08.636
I know. That's why I work in traffic now.

07:09.929 --> 07:13.349
You see,
we always have clear evidence here.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.686
Running red lights,
speeding, not wearing a helmet…

07:16.769 --> 07:20.148
Our evidence is there in pictures.
No one can dispute it.

07:22.817 --> 07:26.070
Jun-ho, do you really not remember

07:27.530 --> 07:28.906
who shot you?

07:32.201 --> 07:33.077
No.

08:13.284 --> 08:14.160
In-ho.

08:17.246 --> 08:18.206
Come with me.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.459
In-ho, why…

08:31.552 --> 08:33.012
Where are we going?

08:33.846 --> 08:35.556
Look, there's a motel here.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.599
Here?

08:37.642 --> 08:38.518
What?

08:41.187 --> 08:42.146
Excuse me.

08:44.440 --> 08:45.483
Is anyone there?

08:46.901 --> 08:48.277
Are you open or what?

08:49.487 --> 08:50.321
Hello?

08:50.404 --> 08:52.907
Babe, do we have to stay here?

08:53.783 --> 08:54.992
Looks like a dump.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.705
The lights are off too. Are they closed?

08:59.789 --> 09:03.167
Good. No lights means the rooms are full.
Let's go someplace else.

09:04.502 --> 09:06.003
How do you know that?

09:07.046 --> 09:07.922
Who told you?

09:08.005 --> 09:10.424
Do you have to ask? I just know.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.594
You just know?
What are you, a motel expert?

09:13.678 --> 09:16.472
Seriously? You're a dick.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.267
-"A dick"…
-You said you liked how I knew everything.

09:20.017 --> 09:23.896
Just tell me how you knew.
Did your ex-boyfriend tell you?

09:23.980 --> 09:24.939
Get lost!

09:25.022 --> 09:26.983
Why can't you answer me?

10:00.891 --> 10:01.851
Who's there?

10:33.549 --> 10:35.134
Player 456.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.054
Looking for these?

11:01.786 --> 11:02.912
It's me.

11:13.255 --> 11:16.967
I got you some food and medicine.
How are you feeling?

11:18.427 --> 11:19.553
I'm fine.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.431
Come on, you don't look any better.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.767
I told you not to overdo it, didn't I?

11:24.850 --> 11:27.770
You'll burn yourself out
before you find that guy.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.689
How did it go?

11:30.731 --> 11:34.443
We checked all the subway stations
on Lines 1 to 4 today.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.196
But again, nothing.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.158
Time of search?

11:41.242 --> 11:43.035
From 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.331
We took one-hour lunch and dinner breaks.
We take turns eating.

11:49.041 --> 11:53.838
What if he knows you're onto him
and he's gone somewhere else?

11:54.463 --> 11:57.967
We've been searching for two years
but found no trace of him.

11:58.467 --> 12:04.390
Tomorrow, get more men, extend the search.
From the first train to the last.

12:05.099 --> 12:07.560
Check all the lines at the same time.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.395
All the lines at the same time?

12:10.980 --> 12:14.775
Pulling off something that extensive

12:14.859 --> 12:17.486
would mean shelling out
a ton of money on staff.

12:29.832 --> 12:33.627
I was approached by him three years ago,
around this time of year.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.882
If the game is still going on,

12:39.300 --> 12:41.010
he's recruiting players right now.

12:44.597 --> 12:49.310
It may take another year
if we don't find him now.

12:51.437 --> 12:54.482
Yeah… Okay, I got it.

12:54.565 --> 12:58.569
I… I'll make sure to find him this time.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.070
I promise.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.620
-Woo-seok.
-Yeah.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.749
From tomorrow,
we're going to need more people.

13:11.832 --> 13:15.211
What? But how many more?

13:15.294 --> 13:17.463
Just call everyone you know.

13:17.546 --> 13:21.300
-But--
-Also, we start at 6 a.m.

13:21.383 --> 13:24.094
So don't stay out drinking.
Go home and get some sleep.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.931
At 6 a.m.? Who'd play ddakji at--

13:27.014 --> 13:31.352
Come on. Boss. I've thought about it,
but it just doesn't make any sense--

13:31.435 --> 13:34.897
No. I'm sure something is going on.

13:34.980 --> 13:38.776
As you know, most of the people
who owe me money

13:38.859 --> 13:40.694
have disappeared over the last few years.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.738
-I never got any money back…
-Okay.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.866
So you think everyone who owes you money
was taken to some island

13:45.950 --> 13:48.244
and got killed playing kiddie games.
That sounds--

13:48.327 --> 13:50.287
Goddamnit, I barely believe a word,

13:50.371 --> 13:52.456
but I'm doing this for the money!

13:55.292 --> 13:58.045
If Seong Gi-hun hadn't come to me himself

13:58.128 --> 14:01.131
to pay off his debt
and hired me for this job,

14:01.215 --> 14:04.218
I couldn't have paid you all
or kept the business running.

14:04.301 --> 14:05.135
I know that, but--

14:05.219 --> 14:08.013
Then shut up and search
with your eyes wide open.

14:08.097 --> 14:08.931
Okay.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.851
If we find that bastard with the ddakji,

14:11.934 --> 14:14.770
we will get a one-billion won reward.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.230
One billion?

14:16.313 --> 14:19.567
That's right.
Do you want to believe his story now?

14:19.650 --> 14:20.776
-But--
-Tell you what.

14:21.735 --> 14:25.072
Whoever finds the guy,
I'll give you half the money. Okay?

14:25.155 --> 14:27.533
-So 500 million?
-That's right!

14:27.616 --> 14:29.368
Well, what are we waiting for?

14:29.451 --> 14:31.620
Five hundred million won!

15:08.365 --> 15:09.533
Captain.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.451
Hello.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.162
How have you been?

15:13.662 --> 15:15.497
Same old, same old.

15:16.540 --> 15:21.879
When the weather is good, I catch fish.
When it's bad, I catch a buzz.

15:21.962 --> 15:26.300
You still look great for someone
who drinks every day, Captain Park.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.636
Save it and put this on.

15:28.719 --> 15:31.013
We've got a mystery island to find.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.938
Where can I take you today, Captain Hwang?

15:39.021 --> 15:42.232
We've checked pretty much everywhere
over the past year and a half,

15:42.316 --> 15:45.361
but you want to keep going,
and I don't know where else to take you.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.822
Where are you, mystery island?

15:49.740 --> 15:55.037
Some places couldn't be checked properly
because of the conditions or tide changes.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.373
I've narrowed them down.

15:59.708 --> 16:00.834
Let's try here today.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.795
Sure thing, Captain Hwang.

16:04.171 --> 16:07.841
Man, why did I have to save a drowning man

16:07.925 --> 16:12.012
and put myself through all this trouble?
I pity myself.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.106
SUNSHINE CAPITAL

16:22.189 --> 16:23.190
All right. Listen up.

16:23.273 --> 16:25.818
The person we're looking for

16:26.902 --> 16:28.028
is this guy.

16:28.570 --> 16:32.032
He's tall, probably over 6 ft.

16:32.116 --> 16:36.704
He's a good-looking fella in a nice suit,
with a briefcase in hand.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.414
And in that briefcase,

16:39.248 --> 16:42.042
he's got stacks of money and ddakji.

16:43.377 --> 16:47.423
He plays ddakji with strangers
at subway stations, and afterwards…

16:49.842 --> 16:51.635
he gives them a card like this.

16:51.719 --> 16:53.387
-I can't see.
-What does it say?

16:53.887 --> 16:58.559
The moment you spot someone like that,
call the number we gave you.

17:00.728 --> 17:01.645
Take a picture.

17:03.605 --> 17:06.775
-Hold on, I can't see.
-Move your head.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.653
-Please move!
-Just a little bit!

17:09.737 --> 17:12.197
All right. Are you done?

17:12.865 --> 17:14.616
Here are your designated areas.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.951
Group 1, Lines 1 and 2.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.746
Group 2, Lines 3 and 4.
Group 3, Lines 5 and 6.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.873
Group 4, Lines 7 and 8. And Group 5,

17:20.956 --> 17:23.876
the Gyeongui-Jungang Line
and the Airport Railroad.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.878
From the first train to the last,

17:25.961 --> 17:30.591
search the stations one by one.

17:30.674 --> 17:32.217
Every single one of them.

17:32.301 --> 17:35.763
Do not skip a single station.

17:35.846 --> 17:36.930
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

17:37.014 --> 17:39.767
Now, after searching each station,

17:39.850 --> 17:43.729
take a picture to prove it
and send it to the group chat.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.607
Otherwise, you won't get paid.
Are we clear?

17:46.690 --> 17:48.108
-Yes, sir!
-One last thing.

17:48.692 --> 17:50.652
The team that finds the guy

17:51.236 --> 17:54.239
gets a bonus of 500 million won.

17:56.492 --> 17:59.995
Damn, 500 million? Really?

18:13.092 --> 18:14.176
After you, sir.

18:17.638 --> 18:19.723
Let's go make 500 million won!

18:25.437 --> 18:27.231
We're heading to the subway stations.

18:27.314 --> 18:30.734
I'll be on standby at the usual spot.
Keep me posted.

18:30.818 --> 18:31.735
Okay.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.138
SEARCHING YONGDU STATION

19:01.890 --> 19:02.850
SEARCHING OKSU STATION

19:12.442 --> 19:15.237
Have you seen a guy like this?
He's tall and…

19:15.320 --> 19:17.781
-A man in a suit, with a briefcase.
-I'm not sure.

19:18.866 --> 19:22.286
If he flips mine like this,
it means I lose, right?

19:22.369 --> 19:23.996
So I get slapped.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.039
Like this. Have you seen it?

19:26.123 --> 19:28.125
A man in a suit
slapping people in the face.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.553
-Excuse me.
-Who are you?

19:39.636 --> 19:40.679
Sorry.

19:41.263 --> 19:44.391
Excuse me. Let me take a quick look.

19:44.474 --> 19:45.601
Hey, it's all right.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.686
Just a quick check.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.315
Excuse me.

19:51.857 --> 19:52.941
Who are you?

19:53.025 --> 19:53.984
It'll be quick.

19:55.652 --> 19:56.904
How did it go?

20:04.119 --> 20:04.953
Right here.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.705
Smile.

20:07.247 --> 20:08.916
-One.
-Look serious.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.585
HANGANGJIN STATION CLEAR

20:19.176 --> 20:20.552
-We need a photo.
-Yeah.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.729
TODAY'S SEARCH HAS ENDED

20:35.692 --> 20:38.528
Captain Hwang, we're heading back now.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.571
Yeah.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.391
We've got to eat something first.

21:25.826 --> 21:26.660
Hold on tight!

21:34.001 --> 21:35.335
For God's sake.

21:43.051 --> 21:46.888
Time for another selfie.
Let's take one now.

21:47.514 --> 21:48.724
Oh, man.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.851
TODAY'S SEARCH HAS ENDED

21:58.775 --> 22:01.862
I told you this was a terrible idea
in this weather.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.822
There are whirlpools in that area.

22:03.905 --> 22:06.867
No one ever really goes there,
not even the big boats.

22:07.826 --> 22:09.328
We're lucky we didn't capsize.

22:10.412 --> 22:12.664
We almost joined the mermaids
looking for that island.

22:14.624 --> 22:15.709
I'm sorry.

22:15.792 --> 22:18.837
Why did I have to pull you
out of the water that day

22:18.920 --> 22:21.256
and end up risking my life
doing this shit for nothing?

22:22.174 --> 22:23.884
I'm forever grateful.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.594
Do you know how many islands there are

22:25.677 --> 22:27.971
within a 6-mile radius
of where I found you?

22:28.055 --> 22:29.306
There are hundreds.

22:29.389 --> 22:31.141
And the currents are strong out there.

22:31.224 --> 22:34.728
There's no telling how far
you drifted with that buoy.

22:35.562 --> 22:38.357
You can't even remember which island
you fell from,

22:38.440 --> 22:41.443
let alone the island
where they play the games.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.737
So how in the world would we find it?

22:46.114 --> 22:47.407
You're right. It's time to stop.

22:48.950 --> 22:50.494
We've done enough.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.210
You say that now,
but I know you'll be back next week.

23:00.295 --> 23:02.506
Thank you for saving my life

23:02.589 --> 23:04.800
and helping me look for the island.

23:04.883 --> 23:07.135
I promise I'll find a way to repay you.

23:09.262 --> 23:10.597
You don't have to do that.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.354
I'm sad to hear that
you won't be coming back.

23:18.105 --> 23:19.606
I'll come visit from time to time.

23:21.775 --> 23:25.153
All right.
Come and catch squid with me, okay?

23:25.237 --> 23:28.365
It's so hard to find good crew members
these days.

23:28.448 --> 23:31.159
I'll pay you more than
what you make as an officer.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.787
Oh, how much?

23:33.870 --> 23:38.291
Well, let's talk about that over a drink
when we get back.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.794
There's the port.

23:41.878 --> 23:44.297
The doors are opening.

23:52.347 --> 23:53.640
The doors are closing.

23:53.723 --> 23:54.975
There.

24:02.065 --> 24:04.317
You've got to be kidding me with this.

24:04.401 --> 24:07.195
Even construction workers
get proper food these days.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.698
This is just… Damn.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.366
You little…

24:11.450 --> 24:15.287
You're making easy money down here
in the middle of summer.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.747
Count your blessings.

24:17.831 --> 24:21.209
You idiot.
Go work at a construction site then.

24:26.256 --> 24:27.632
Seriously though.

24:27.716 --> 24:31.011
How much of Seong Gi-hun's story
do you actually believe?

24:31.094 --> 24:34.764
We've been searching every subway station
in the city all summer,

24:34.848 --> 24:36.266
but no one's ever seen the guy.

24:37.642 --> 24:38.560
Here's the thing.

24:39.686 --> 24:42.189
-I've been thinking.
-Yeah?

24:42.272 --> 24:44.691
Seong Gi-hun may be crazy,

24:45.525 --> 24:50.447
but he wouldn't waste billions
looking for someone who doesn't exist.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.949
He's onto something for sure.

24:53.033 --> 24:58.205
Come on, boss. We've been searching
these stations for the past two years.

24:58.288 --> 25:01.291
Not days, years. Two whole years.

25:02.584 --> 25:06.296
My wife says I should find that bastard,
get myself into the game,

25:06.379 --> 25:09.007
and bring home 45.6 billion won.

25:09.090 --> 25:12.385
If someone were playing ddakji down here,
we would've found him--

25:27.442 --> 25:28.360
Yes!

25:56.221 --> 25:57.055
Hello?

25:57.138 --> 25:59.099
We've found the guy. It's him.

26:01.643 --> 26:02.477
Are you sure?

26:02.561 --> 26:05.188
The ddakji, slapping, and money.
It's just like you said.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.191
He's handing over the card now.

26:11.444 --> 26:12.487
Where are you?

26:12.571 --> 26:14.864
Jonggak Station, but he's leaving.

26:14.948 --> 26:15.991
I'm on my way.

26:16.575 --> 26:19.160
Follow him carefully,
and keep me updated on his location.

26:19.244 --> 26:22.205
Stay on him until I get there.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.082
I got it. I'll be in touch.

26:44.477 --> 26:46.896
JUN-HEE

26:48.940 --> 26:52.110
OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY

26:55.655 --> 26:59.451
The phone is off.
You will be directed to voicemail…

27:17.844 --> 27:19.262
Ms. Kim Jun-hee.

27:21.514 --> 27:23.058
Is there a Ms. Kim Jun-hee here?

27:28.063 --> 27:29.314
Ms. Park Mi-yeong.

27:29.397 --> 27:30.231
-Yes.
-Yes.

27:30.315 --> 27:31.524
We're ready for you.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.533
All of them?

27:43.536 --> 27:45.622
I'm sorry? A hundred scratchers?

27:48.291 --> 27:49.834
Good dreams last night?

28:20.281 --> 28:22.242
Hey. He's gone into Tapgol Park.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.493
I'm heading there now.

28:23.576 --> 28:25.954
Do not approach him. Wait for me.

28:26.037 --> 28:27.831
Okay. Hurry up.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.273
Excuse me, sir.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.114
Hello.

29:02.824 --> 29:05.785
You seem to be struggling,
living a life with no future.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.706
I have a little gift for you today.

29:10.707 --> 29:11.583
A gift?

29:13.042 --> 29:14.002
What is it?

29:27.891 --> 29:29.768
You can only have one.

29:29.851 --> 29:34.022
Bread, or lottery. You have to choose one.

30:04.010 --> 30:05.011
SORRY!

30:06.721 --> 30:07.639
You lost.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.267
The coin, please.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.331
-Woo-seok.
-Yeah.

30:33.414 --> 30:35.208
What the hell do you think he's doing?

30:36.793 --> 30:37.710
I don't know.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.839
Maybe he's a good guy. I'm confused.

31:06.531 --> 31:07.907
SORRY!

31:07.991 --> 31:09.367
Damn it.

31:25.633 --> 31:26.593
Damn it.

31:26.676 --> 31:27.719
Damn it.

31:38.021 --> 31:40.815
Damn it! Fucking hell.

31:54.871 --> 31:57.290
How come he's not giving us one?

31:57.373 --> 32:00.209
Beats me.
Man, I had a lucky dream last night.

32:18.478 --> 32:19.938
What is he doing?

32:21.356 --> 32:24.692
Why would you throw away
perfectly good food like that?

32:29.113 --> 32:33.451
I gave you a chance,
and you made your choice.

32:34.994 --> 32:37.997
I'm not the one who threw these away.

32:39.248 --> 32:40.792
It was you, ladies and gentlemen.

32:53.096 --> 32:54.263
What's wrong with him?

33:37.223 --> 33:39.267
Plate number 2071, pull over.

33:40.476 --> 33:42.603
Plate number 2071, pull over now.

34:00.413 --> 34:01.289
You take this one.

34:01.956 --> 34:02.790
Me?

34:03.666 --> 34:05.793
They'll either beg you to let it slide

34:05.877 --> 34:08.171
or complain about us hiding
to give people tickets.

34:08.838 --> 34:12.425
Don't be unkind,
but don't listen to them go on about it.

34:12.508 --> 34:15.094
Just be polite and professional. Got it?

34:15.803 --> 34:16.846
Yes, sir.

34:28.232 --> 34:31.569
Sir, you were going over the speed limit.
Can I see your license?

34:48.544 --> 34:50.213
Taxi!

34:51.881 --> 34:53.299
Come on!

34:55.301 --> 34:58.137
Please follow that orange cab over there.

34:58.221 --> 34:59.889
-What?
-Shit.

34:59.972 --> 35:02.308
I'll pay double if you catch up with it.

35:02.391 --> 35:03.392
All right!

35:11.109 --> 35:13.152
Where are you? Are you coming?

35:13.861 --> 35:15.530
I'll be there soon.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.406
This guy is a total nutcase.

35:17.490 --> 35:21.202
He's in a cab now.
I'll keep you updated, but hurry!

35:21.285 --> 35:22.453
I got it.

35:26.791 --> 35:29.168
The fine for speeding is 60,000 won.
Make sure--

35:37.260 --> 35:40.388
That was quick.
Did you do everything right?

35:40.471 --> 35:44.392
Well, he just took the ticket
and drove off without saying anything.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.603
That's suspicious. Did you run his ID?

35:48.521 --> 35:49.939
Nothing came up.

35:50.773 --> 35:52.275
I don't know what he does,

35:52.358 --> 35:55.945
but he had a lot of cell phones
and tablets in his car.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.577

NO CRIMINAL RECORD FOUND

36:08.166 --> 36:10.626
-Turn right here.
-All right.

36:13.629 --> 36:15.089
Boss, he's getting out!

36:15.173 --> 36:16.007
He just got out.

36:16.090 --> 36:17.758
I'll send the address.
Call when you arrive.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.051
You can drop us off here.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.052
Okay.

36:21.804 --> 36:23.890
Here. Thank you.

36:25.516 --> 36:26.684
Where's Seong?

36:26.767 --> 36:28.102
He'll be here in ten minutes.

36:32.815 --> 36:36.986
Hey, we might lose him if we wait.
Let's just get him by ourselves.

36:37.778 --> 36:39.947
-By ourselves?
-That's right. Are you scared?

36:40.031 --> 36:41.657
It's two against one.

36:41.741 --> 36:43.409
Don't be a coward now you're married.

36:43.492 --> 36:46.120
It's just that
something seems off with that guy.

36:46.204 --> 36:48.497
Besides, Seong told us
to wait until he gets here.

36:48.581 --> 36:51.626
But what if we lose him?
What if Seong doesn't give us the money?

36:52.126 --> 36:53.544
Woo-seok. It's a billion won!

36:56.923 --> 36:58.299
You'll give me half, right?

36:58.382 --> 37:01.552
Don't you trust me?
I officiated your wedding, for God's sake.

37:06.807 --> 37:07.642
Come on.

37:13.272 --> 37:14.899
-Hey, you! Stop!
-Stop!

37:16.943 --> 37:18.194
Hey, you!

37:21.656 --> 37:22.823
Boss!

37:28.371 --> 37:30.706
Come on! Come at me, damn it!

37:32.833 --> 37:33.793
Woo-seok…

Mr. Seong.

37:53.938 --> 37:54.855
Please help me.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.109
I need to find my brother.

38:03.072 --> 38:04.198
I'm sorry.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.578
I'm not in a position
to help anyone at the moment.

MR. KIM

39:43.756 --> 39:46.967
It looks like the car you're asking about

39:47.051 --> 39:49.595
is currently being rented by a company.

39:49.678 --> 39:52.264
A company? What's the name?

39:54.558 --> 39:57.103
It says, "Sunshine Capital."

39:58.604 --> 39:59.980
The address, please.

40:48.654 --> 40:50.781
You're going to play a game now.

40:50.865 --> 40:56.203
Rock, Paper, Scissors, Minus One.
I trust you know the rules.

40:56.954 --> 40:59.498
You form a shape with each hand,
then take one away.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.792
The game is decided
by the remaining hands.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.629
Of course,
there's a penalty for the loser.

41:06.589 --> 41:10.259
I'm sure you've seen this in movies.
It's called Russian Roulette.

41:11.760 --> 41:17.099
I'll place one bullet into a revolver
and close it.

41:17.808 --> 41:20.644
I'll point the gun at the loser's head
and pull the trigger.

41:23.689 --> 41:25.774
Your odds of death are 1 in 6.

41:27.193 --> 41:28.861
Your odds of survival are 5 in 6.

41:37.119 --> 41:38.496
Not that bad, right?

41:41.665 --> 41:45.419
All right. Now, let's play. On my count.

41:52.218 --> 41:55.679
Rock, paper, scissors.

42:00.559 --> 42:02.394
You didn't play.

42:03.270 --> 42:05.272
You broke the rules for the first round.

42:06.065 --> 42:07.191
Disqualified.

42:25.459 --> 42:27.419
Now, let's play again.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.172
Rock, paper, scissors.

42:30.965 --> 42:32.132
Minus one.

42:48.274 --> 42:50.109
Don't be so nervous.

42:50.192 --> 42:53.571
Like I said,
your odds of survival are 5 in 6.

42:56.448 --> 42:57.616
Let's play again.

43:01.245 --> 43:02.621
Rock, paper, scissors.

43:02.705 --> 43:03.539
Minus one.

43:10.004 --> 43:12.840
It's getting a little boring, isn't it?

43:14.758 --> 43:17.303
Let's reverse the odds now, shall we?

43:17.386 --> 43:19.471
Your odds of survival are now 1 in 6.

43:19.555 --> 43:21.807
Please don't…

43:21.890 --> 43:25.019
Your odds of death are 5 in 6.

43:28.981 --> 43:30.983
All right, let's play again.

43:32.234 --> 43:33.485
Let's speed it up, okay?

43:34.987 --> 43:37.156
Rock, paper, scissors. Minus one.

Rock, paper, scissors. Minus one.

43:42.911 --> 43:43.912
Rock, paper, scissors!

44:19.156 --> 44:20.824
Minus one.

44:31.669 --> 44:34.672
Too bad. You didn't take one away.

44:48.936 --> 44:49.895
Disqualified.

45:19.383 --> 45:20.843
Congratulations on your win.

45:22.553 --> 45:26.223
Now, can we have a talk?

45:29.893 --> 45:32.479
SUNSHINE CAPITAL

47:08.033 --> 47:10.118
That's right.
The boss hasn't come back yet.

47:10.202 --> 47:13.247
Seong says he and Woo-seok

47:13.330 --> 47:16.041
were following that guy with the ddakji
when he lost contact with them.

47:16.124 --> 47:17.584
How the hell would I know?

47:17.668 --> 47:20.087
Anyway, gather everyone
and go to Daebang Station.

47:20.170 --> 47:22.130
I'll pick up some weapons from the office.

47:50.367 --> 47:51.201
Yeah.

47:52.744 --> 47:55.706
I said Daebang Station, you idiot.
Not Sindaebang.

47:55.789 --> 47:58.417
Don't make me
keep repeating myself, blockhead.

47:58.959 --> 48:01.253
That's what I said! Call everyone now!

48:02.212 --> 48:03.672
Goddamn idiot.

48:35.078 --> 48:36.455
IOU

48:36.538 --> 48:37.539
SEONG GI-HUN

48:47.633 --> 48:51.929
CERTIFICATE OF BUSINESS REGISTRATION
PINK MOTEL

48:53.305 --> 48:55.182
I found bloodstains there.

48:55.974 --> 48:58.810
I'm sure they didn't get far
from that alley.

48:58.894 --> 49:02.439
Check all the CCTV and dashcam footage
you can collect from the area

49:02.522 --> 49:05.275
and keep asking around.
I'll join you soon.

49:37.099 --> 49:38.934
It's been a long time, Mr. Seong Gi-hun.

49:49.736 --> 49:52.322
You should've gotten
on that plane that day.

49:55.158 --> 49:58.161
I changed my mind when I saw you.

50:02.666 --> 50:05.711
It looks like
you've been trying hard to find me.

50:07.045 --> 50:08.964
I wanted to thank you.

50:12.342 --> 50:13.510
Thank me?

50:18.974 --> 50:20.892
For inviting me to the game.

50:22.728 --> 50:24.229
I won

50:25.105 --> 50:27.774
and made it out with a fortune.

50:30.027 --> 50:33.196
The decent thing to do
would be to thank you for it.

50:34.156 --> 50:37.325
I'm just a messenger
who delivers invitations.

50:37.409 --> 50:40.203
Who had you deliver those invitations?

50:42.205 --> 50:45.333
Let me meet him. I have something to say.

50:46.626 --> 50:49.463
Give me the message,
and I'll pass it along.

50:49.546 --> 50:53.050
It's not something I can discuss
with an underling like you.

50:54.009 --> 50:56.428
You prey on people
who are hanging by a thread

50:56.511 --> 50:59.097
and con them at subway stations.

51:00.515 --> 51:03.935
Someone like you wouldn't be able
to understand what I'm trying to say.

51:06.313 --> 51:07.314
Mr. Seong.

51:11.568 --> 51:14.196
How do you think I got to where I am now?

51:16.698 --> 51:19.868
I don't care how you became their dog.

51:22.204 --> 51:24.039
Bring me your master.

51:32.005 --> 51:34.257
I used to work in the games
when I was younger.

51:35.425 --> 51:39.262
I removed and burned the bodies
of countless people like you.

51:41.348 --> 51:42.849
"These things aren't human."

51:44.434 --> 51:48.146
"They're just trash,
utterly useless in this world."

51:49.606 --> 51:52.442
I kept telling myself that
and worked hard for a few years.

51:54.402 --> 51:55.862
Then they gave me a gun.

51:59.324 --> 52:00.742
It felt pretty good.

52:02.911 --> 52:06.164
Like my existence was acknowledged
for the first time in my life.

52:09.918 --> 52:12.087
I don't know which year it was,
but one day,

52:14.131 --> 52:17.134
I was about to shoot a man
who had lost a game.

52:20.679 --> 52:22.848
The guy seemed familiar.

52:25.142 --> 52:26.226
Guess who it was.

52:28.478 --> 52:29.521
My dad.

52:34.985 --> 52:37.445
My dad was suddenly
standing right in front of me.

52:39.489 --> 52:43.702
He was in tears,
desperately begging me to spare his life.

52:46.288 --> 52:49.833
I shot him right in the middle
of his forehead, and realized,

52:50.709 --> 52:51.543
"Ah."

52:54.546 --> 52:56.840
"I'm cut out for this job."

53:00.552 --> 53:03.096
Whether you shoot people in there

53:04.723 --> 53:07.893
or con them outside,
it doesn't change anything.

53:10.103 --> 53:13.481
You have always been…

53:15.775 --> 53:18.195
nothing more than their dog.

53:19.070 --> 53:20.197
Mr. Seong.

53:22.490 --> 53:27.329
Do you think you're special
because you won the game?

53:29.664 --> 53:31.124
Someone like you

53:32.167 --> 53:34.252
could never know…

53:36.546 --> 53:38.173
or understand

53:39.883 --> 53:43.929
how I made it out of there alive.

53:46.431 --> 53:48.308
And how it feels…

53:51.519 --> 53:53.063
to play the games.

54:05.450 --> 54:07.035
Let's play a game.

54:21.341 --> 54:24.928
I'm sure you've seen this in the movies.
It's called Russian Roulette.

54:25.553 --> 54:29.140
Usually, you place one bullet in the gun,
spin the cylinder,

54:30.141 --> 54:31.226
and pull the trigger.

54:33.186 --> 54:37.357
And before the next round,
you spin the cylinder again.

54:39.150 --> 54:41.611
It resets the odds back to 1 in 6.

54:42.237 --> 54:45.073
But I'd like to make
this game a little more serious.

54:46.741 --> 54:48.952
Because you're special, Mr. Seong.

54:49.035 --> 54:50.829
Cut to the chase.

54:51.871 --> 54:56.751
We'll take turns pulling the trigger
without spinning the cylinder again.

54:56.835 --> 55:00.422
The bullet will be fired within
six attempts, and the game will be over.

55:02.590 --> 55:03.508
What do you say?

56:00.857 --> 56:02.275
I've always wondered

56:02.942 --> 56:05.737
how you made it out of there alive.

56:07.781 --> 56:10.200
For one thing,
you were even terrible at ddakji.

56:55.787 --> 56:57.038
What's the matter?

56:57.831 --> 56:59.374
Is your mind starting to race?

57:02.210 --> 57:04.838
Now your odds of death are 1 in 2.

57:06.089 --> 57:07.882
That's pretty high indeed.

57:08.925 --> 57:11.261
I'm sure you're afraid.
Lots going through your mind.

57:11.886 --> 57:15.181
Let me guess
what you're thinking right now.

57:17.725 --> 57:19.102
"The gun is in my hand."

57:20.520 --> 57:24.149
"Screw the rules.
Pull the trigger once or twice,

57:24.232 --> 57:26.192
and I can blow this guy's face off."

57:27.694 --> 57:29.571
Isn't that right?

57:30.905 --> 57:33.783
If you want to meet the person
you mentioned earlier,

57:33.867 --> 57:35.160
the key is in my pocket.

57:35.243 --> 57:38.121
You can simply shoot me
with that gun and take it.

57:38.204 --> 57:40.707
But I'll have you admit one thing.

57:46.671 --> 57:50.049
That you're a piece of trash,
just like everyone else.

57:53.428 --> 57:57.056
A piece of trash who got lucky
and made it out of the dumpster.

58:41.851 --> 58:43.102
What's the matter?

58:43.811 --> 58:45.605
Is your mind starting to race?

58:46.773 --> 58:47.732
That's right.

58:49.275 --> 58:50.735
Screw the rules.

58:52.612 --> 58:55.114
Now, with a single pull of the trigger,

58:57.283 --> 58:58.993
you could kill me.

59:00.537 --> 59:01.454
But…

59:03.915 --> 59:05.708
I'll have you admit one thing.

59:07.544 --> 59:10.463
You put a mask over your face

59:12.006 --> 59:14.133
and do whatever your master says.

59:15.385 --> 59:18.137
You run, bark,

59:20.056 --> 59:21.599
and wag your tail for them.

59:25.853 --> 59:27.855
You're nothing more than their dog.

01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:13.187
