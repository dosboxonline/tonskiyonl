with a DEA investigation,

There was a time

02:15.396 --> 02:18.007
I thought of my father
as this...

02:19.878 --> 02:21.837
...immovable force.

02:21.967 --> 02:23.447
I would see other kids' fathers

02:52.650 --> 02:55.697

memory with him?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.375
I was in Mexico.

04:09.161 --> 04:11.033
I was nine.

04:13.644 --> 04:16.081
We were at my uncle's hacienda.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.562
We were taking pictures,

04:18.693 --> 04:20.869
and my mom wanted us
all on horses.

04:20.956 --> 04:25.003
Me, my sister, my father,

04:25.134 --> 04:28.877
my uncle, his wife,
his two sons.

04:28.964 --> 04:33.142
And he had a daughter.

04:34.970 --> 04:35.884
Maybe a year old.

04:36.014 --> 04:38.234
She could barely walk.

04:38.365 --> 04:41.759
She just stumbled around
like an old drunk,

04:41.890 --> 04:45.285
knocking into everything
and falling down.

04:45.415 --> 04:47.896
And my aunt
placed her on a horse.

04:48.026 --> 04:51.378
And the horse takes off

04:51.552 --> 04:55.295
with the baby
on its back. And...

04:56.600 --> 04:59.081
...we all watched in slow motion

04:59.255 --> 05:01.953
as this baby was
falling six feet to the ground.

05:06.175 --> 05:09.178
My father raced his horse up,

05:09.309 --> 05:12.268
jumped from it,

05:12.442 --> 05:15.619
catches the baby
maybe six inches off the ground,

05:15.793 --> 05:18.100
pulled her
to his chest and rolled.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.279
The baby didn't get a scratch.

05:24.802 --> 05:26.630
But it scared
the shit out of her,

05:26.761 --> 05:28.415

05:28.545 --> 05:29.981
So he handed her to my aunt,

05:30.068 --> 05:31.766
looked at my mother and said,

05:31.853 --> 05:35.030
"Maybe it's better
someone just hold the baby,"

05:35.160 --> 05:40.165
as if he jumped off of horses
to save infants all the time.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.825

05:49.044 --> 05:52.352
There's, uh...

05:52.526 --> 05:56.791

will always be the man he was

06:00.316 --> 06:02.405

06:02.536 --> 06:04.059
Unless he was abusive,

06:04.233 --> 06:06.714
then it's the worst.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.237
And you will always be
the age you were

06:08.368 --> 06:10.108

by security personnel
unknown to the operation.

35:11.761 --> 35:13.198
- Why were they unknown?
- Two reasons.

35:13.328 --> 35:15.287
We were given a timeline
of days to insert,

35:15.417 --> 35:17.506
giving us no time
to mine proper intel.

35:17.593 --> 35:20.814
And two, the DEA agent that was
assigned to our task force

35:20.901 --> 35:23.382
has an informant working
in the Carrillo estate.

35:23.512 --> 35:26.907
This information was withheld
from us, intentionally.

35:27.081 --> 35:28.909
So, this renders everything

35:29.039 --> 35:30.432
we have done to this point
as compromised,

35:30.563 --> 35:33.392
and every future operation
as compromised as well.

35:33.479 --> 35:35.263
Define compromised.

35:35.394 --> 35:37.831
Carrillo physically
assaulted our Lioness,

35:37.918 --> 35:40.703
which caused our shadow
to have to intervene,

35:40.790 --> 35:43.489
which mandated QRF to have
to take control of the scene.

35:43.663 --> 35:46.448
QRF one has removed Carrillo
and the informant

35:46.579 --> 35:49.321
to a safe location
and QRF two remanded

35:49.451 --> 35:51.366
the compromised agent
into custody

35:51.497 --> 35:52.933
- at Bliss--
- [Mason] We are not authorized

35:53.063 --> 35:54.456
to detain a federal agent.

35:54.587 --> 35:56.284
Under U.S. Code 2381,

35:56.415 --> 35:59.287
our officers are authorized
to detain anyone

35:59.374 --> 36:00.723
who gives aid
to our enemies abroad

36:00.854 --> 36:02.377
or within the United States.

36:02.551 --> 36:04.510
TFO is assisting in cleaning up
the scene in Dallas.

36:04.684 --> 36:06.468
Meanwhile, we have to decide
whether we're gonna act

36:06.599 --> 36:08.383
with the information we possess

36:08.514 --> 36:10.516
or whether we're gonna
shut the operation down.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.606
I should also add
that our senior case officer

36:13.736 --> 36:16.130
was injured in the altercation
at the border.

36:16.217 --> 36:17.305
She's being treated at Keesler.

36:17.479 --> 36:19.351
If the operation is successful,
she will be

36:19.481 --> 36:22.136
- transported to Reed.
- Are you talking about Joe?

36:22.267 --> 36:24.051
I am, sir.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.270
Wounded how?

36:25.400 --> 36:27.489
Gunshot to the chest.

36:27.576 --> 36:30.013
The bullet, uh,
penetrated the liver,

36:30.144 --> 36:31.711
fragments entered the lungs.

36:31.885 --> 36:33.930
Is there a prognosis?

36:34.017 --> 36:35.976
- No.
- There is not.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.503
[sighs]

36:41.634 --> 36:43.462
I don't know.

36:45.594 --> 36:49.337
A successful mission would send
a strong message to the Chinese,

36:49.468 --> 36:51.165
but would have no value from

36:51.339 --> 36:53.950
a public perspective standpoint,

36:54.124 --> 36:56.126
because we must publicly deny

36:56.257 --> 36:57.867
that a mission took place.

36:57.998 --> 37:00.348
This feels like a punt.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.699
Slow down,

37:03.786 --> 37:06.311
find another way in.

37:06.441 --> 37:08.791
With less risk

37:08.922 --> 37:11.316
and a lot less
collateral damage.

37:11.403 --> 37:13.405
Unfortunately, sir, I...

37:13.535 --> 37:15.015
I don't think
we're in a stopping place.

37:15.189 --> 37:16.582
- Why not?
- We are currently

37:16.712 --> 37:19.149
holding number two in
the Chihuahua-Coahuila cartel.

37:19.324 --> 37:21.239
That will not go unnoticed.

37:21.413 --> 37:23.632
We are also holding
the agent with the DEA.

37:23.763 --> 37:26.635
He must either be released
or handed over to DOJ.

37:26.766 --> 37:29.421
Well, I don't see a plan
to go forward.

37:29.551 --> 37:32.250
We shift our mission focus, sir.

37:32.380 --> 37:35.557
We shift it from an insertion
to a hard target hit.

37:35.644 --> 37:38.256
We transport Carrillo
back to Mexico.

37:38.386 --> 37:40.954
We focus on the senior
leadership within that cartel.

37:41.041 --> 37:42.608
And we hope that MSS is embedded

37:42.738 --> 37:44.653
- with that leadership.
- [Hollar] How does that solve

37:44.740 --> 37:46.612

detaining a U.S. citizen

37:46.742 --> 37:49.441

and a federal officer?

37:49.571 --> 37:51.573

that neither return

I might lose a best friend, too.

45:57.493 --> 45:59.278
What if he fails?

45:59.365 --> 46:00.932
Dump him in the river.

Afternoon.

46:13.248 --> 46:14.989
Ma'am.

46:19.341 --> 46:20.690
Who are you?

46:22.780 --> 46:24.129
Would you mind having a seat?

46:31.049 --> 46:33.225
Now, we expected you
around 10:00.

46:33.355 --> 46:35.096
Yeah, well...

46:35.227 --> 46:37.795
I went to lunch with my friends,
and then shopping.

46:41.494 --> 46:42.974
Where's my husband?

46:45.237 --> 46:47.630
[grunts softly] Would you
hand me your cell phone?

46:47.717 --> 46:49.502

Where is my husband?

We're gonna take you
to him, okay?
