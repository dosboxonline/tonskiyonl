WEBVTT

01:54.657 --> 01:57.827
<i>Henslowe, do you know
what happens to a man</i>

01:57.911 --> 01:59.746
<i>who doesn't pay his debts?</i>

01:59.829 --> 02:02.749
<i>His boots catch fire!</i>

02:05.126 --> 02:09.297
Why do you howl
when it is I who am bitten?

02:09.380 --> 02:11.925
- What am I, Mr Lambert?
- Bitten, Mr Fennyman.

02:12.008 --> 02:13.635
How badly bitten, Mr Frees?

02:13.718 --> 02:16.971
Twelve pounds, one shilling and four pence,
Mr Fennyman, including interest.

02:17.055 --> 02:19.474
- I can pay you!
- When?

02:19.557 --> 02:22.560
Two weeks! Three weeks at the most!
For pity's sake!

02:22.644 --> 02:24.771
Take them out.

02:24.854 --> 02:25.939
Where will you find...

02:26.022 --> 02:28.358
Sixteen pounds,
five shillings and nine pence.

02:28.441 --> 02:30.568
Including interest,
in three weeks?

02:30.652 --> 02:33.696
- I have a wonderful new play.
- Put them back in.

02:33.780 --> 02:35.573
- It's a comedy!
- Cut off his nose.

02:36.115 --> 02:38.117
It's a new comedy by William Shakespeare.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.205
- And his ears.
- And a share!

02:42.580 --> 02:44.207
We will be partners, Mr Fennyman!

02:46.584 --> 02:47.919
Partners?

02:53.007 --> 02:54.342
It's a crowd-tickler.

02:54.425 --> 02:59.514
Mistaken identities, shipwreck, pirate king,
a bit with a dog, and love triumphant.

02:59.597 --> 03:02.016
I think I've seen it. I didn't like it.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.477
But this time it is by Shakespeare.

03:05.103 --> 03:08.982
- What's it called?
<i>- Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.</i>

03:09.232 --> 03:10.650
Good title.

03:12.485 --> 03:14.696
A play takes time.
Find the actors, rehearsals.

03:14.779 --> 03:16.364
Let's say we open in two weeks.

03:16.447 --> 03:19.409
That's, what, 500 groundlings
at tuppence a head?

03:19.492 --> 03:23.705
In addition, 400 backsides at threepence,
a penny extra for cushions.

03:23.788 --> 03:25.957
Call it, 200 cushions.

03:26.040 --> 03:29.502
Say, two performances for safety.
How much is that, Mr Frees?

03:29.586 --> 03:31.713
Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr Fennyman.

03:31.796 --> 03:32.839
Correct.

03:32.922 --> 03:35.717
- But I have to pay the actors and the author.
- Share of the profits.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.136
- There's never any.
- Of course not.

03:40.096 --> 03:42.557
Mr Fennyman, I think you might have
hit upon something.

03:42.974 --> 03:44.142
Sign there.

03:49.355 --> 03:52.692
So, <i>Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.</i>

03:53.610 --> 03:54.652
Almost finished?

03:54.986 --> 03:58.323
Without doubt, he's completing it
at this very moment.

04:56.547 --> 04:57.882
Will.

04:58.508 --> 04:59.717
Will!

05:00.969 --> 05:02.220
Where is my play?

05:02.303 --> 05:05.223
Tell me you have it nearly done.
Tell me you have it started.

05:05.723 --> 05:09.102
"Doubt thou the stars are fire
Doubt that the sun doth move"

05:09.185 --> 05:12.188
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose.

05:12.271 --> 05:13.481
Where is my play?

05:13.564 --> 05:16.192
- It is all locked safe in here.
- God be praised.

05:17.568 --> 05:18.945
Locked?

05:19.028 --> 05:22.198
- As soon as I find my muse.
- Who is she this time?

05:22.281 --> 05:23.491
She is always Aphrodite.

05:23.574 --> 05:26.411
Aphrodite Baggot,
who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?

05:26.995 --> 05:29.831
Henslowe, you have no soul,

05:29.914 --> 05:33.334
so how can you understand
the emptiness that seeks a soul mate?

05:33.418 --> 05:35.461
Will!

05:35.545 --> 05:37.588
I am a dead man, and buggered to boot.

05:37.672 --> 05:40.717
My theatre is closed by the plague
these 12 weeks.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.553
My actors are forced to tour
the inn yards of England

05:43.636 --> 05:45.513
while Mr Burbage
and the Chamberlain's Men

05:45.596 --> 05:49.684
are invited to court
and receive 10 pounds to play your piece,

05:49.767 --> 05:52.812
written for my theatre,
by my writer, at my risk,

05:52.895 --> 05:54.105
when you were green and grateful.

05:54.188 --> 05:58.109
- What piece? <i>Richard Crookback?</i>
- No! It's comedy they want, Will. Comedy.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.444
Like <i>Romeo and Ethel.</i>

05:59.527 --> 06:03.156
- Who wrote that?
- Nobody. You were writing it for me.

06:03.239 --> 06:05.742
- I gave you three pound a month since.
- Half what you owe me.

06:05.825 --> 06:07.744
I'm still due for <i>One Gentleman of Verona.</i>

06:07.827 --> 06:12.290
Will, what is money to you and me?
I, your patron. You, my wordwright.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.374
When the plague lifts,

06:13.458 --> 06:15.877
Burbage will have a new play
by Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain.

06:15.960 --> 06:19.047
- I will have nothing for the Rose.
- Mr Henslowe.

06:19.130 --> 06:21.758
- Will you lend me 50 pounds?
- 50 pounds? What for?

06:21.841 --> 06:23.843
Burbage offers me a partnership
in the Chamberlain's Men.

06:23.926 --> 06:26.596
For 50 pounds,
my days as a hired player are over.

06:26.804 --> 06:30.725
Cut out my heart.
Throw my liver to the dogs.

06:31.017 --> 06:32.185
No, then?

06:32.268 --> 06:34.687
Theatres are handmaidens
of the devil!

06:34.812 --> 06:40.401
The players breed lewdness in your wives
and wickedness in your children!

06:40.485 --> 06:44.989
And the Rose smells
thusly rank by any name!

06:45.364 --> 06:49.952
I say, a plague on both their houses!

06:50.995 --> 06:53.998
- Where are you going?
- My weekly confession.

06:59.337 --> 07:01.547
Words, words, words.

07:02.423 --> 07:04.300
Once, I had the gift.

07:04.842 --> 07:08.262
I could make love out of words
as a potter makes cups of clay.

07:08.346 --> 07:09.847
Love that overthrows empires.

07:09.931 --> 07:13.935
Love that binds two hearts together,
come hellfire and brimstone.

07:14.018 --> 07:17.688
For six pence a line,
I could cause a riot in a nunnery.

07:18.189 --> 07:21.609
- But now...
- And yet you tell me you lie with women.

07:23.820 --> 07:26.072
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe,

07:26.155 --> 07:29.951
Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress,
Aphrodite, who does it behind...

07:30.034 --> 07:32.036
Yes, now and again. What of it?

07:33.079 --> 07:34.664
I have lost my gift.

07:35.081 --> 07:37.291
I am here to help you.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.669
Tell me, in your own words.

07:44.090 --> 07:46.425
It's as if my quill is broken,

07:47.635 --> 07:50.847
as if the organ of my imagination
has dried up,

07:51.556 --> 07:54.892
as if the proud tower
of my genius has collapsed.

07:55.351 --> 07:57.353
- Interesting.
- Nothing comes.

07:57.436 --> 07:58.729
Most interesting.

07:58.813 --> 08:01.691
It's like trying to pick a lock
with a wet herring.

08:03.609 --> 08:07.238
Tell me, are you lately humbled
in the act of love?

08:10.741 --> 08:12.577
How long has it been?

08:13.786 --> 08:16.330
A goodly length in times past, but lately...

08:16.414 --> 08:19.959
No, no. You have a wife, children?

08:23.129 --> 08:24.255
Aye.

08:26.507 --> 08:27.508
I was a lad of 18.

08:27.592 --> 08:29.927
Anne Hathaway was a woman
half as old again.

08:30.011 --> 08:33.054
- A woman of property?
- She had a cottage.

08:34.056 --> 08:35.975
One day she was three months
gone with child, so...

08:36.058 --> 08:38.102
And your relations?

08:38.186 --> 08:42.273
- On my mother's side, the Ardens.
- No, your marriage bed.

08:42.982 --> 08:46.444
Four years and a hundred miles away
in Stratford.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.864
A cold bed, too, since the twins were born.

08:49.947 --> 08:51.449
Banishment was a blessing.

08:51.532 --> 08:55.536
- So, now you are free to love...
- Yet cannot love, nor write it.

08:58.456 --> 09:02.084
Here is a bangle found in

09:02.668 --> 09:05.755
Psyche's temple on Olympus.

09:05.838 --> 09:07.673
Cheap at four pence.

09:07.757 --> 09:12.637
Write your name on a paper
and feed it into the snake.

09:13.221 --> 09:14.889
Will it restore my gift?

09:14.972 --> 09:18.226
The woman who wears the snake will
dream of you, and your gift will return.

09:18.309 --> 09:20.937
Words will flow like a river.

09:22.021 --> 09:23.814
See you next week.

09:25.816 --> 09:28.653
- Now where?
- To the palace at Whitehall.

09:29.570 --> 09:30.947
All right.

09:34.700 --> 09:37.411
- Hello, Will.
- Prithee, Mr Kempe. Break a leg.

09:39.205 --> 09:40.373
You, too, good Crab.

09:40.456 --> 09:42.875
Crab's nervous.
He's never played the palace.

09:42.959 --> 09:46.045
When will you write me a tragedy, Will?
I could do it.

09:46.128 --> 09:48.339
No, they would laugh at Seneca
if you played it.

09:48.923 --> 09:52.093
There is no dog in the first scene,
Mr Kempe, thank you.

09:52.176 --> 09:55.221
- How goes it, Will?
- I'm still owed money for this play, Burbage.

09:55.304 --> 09:56.889
Not by me. I only stole it.

09:56.973 --> 09:59.350
My sleeve wants for a button,
Mistress Rosaline.

09:59.433 --> 10:01.894
Where were my seamstress's eyes?

10:02.728 --> 10:04.605
When are you coming over
to the Chamberlain's Men?

10:04.689 --> 10:06.440
When I have 50 pounds.

10:06.524 --> 10:09.610
- You writing?
- A comedy. All but done.

10:10.319 --> 10:13.281
- A pirate comedy. Wonderful.
- Bring it tomorrow.

10:13.364 --> 10:14.824
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.

10:14.907 --> 10:16.200
- How much?
- 10 pounds.

10:16.284 --> 10:17.326
- You're a liar.
- I swear.

10:17.410 --> 10:19.537
He wants Romeo for
Ned and the Admiral's Men.

10:19.620 --> 10:23.165
- Mmm, Ned's wrong for it.
- Will!

10:26.168 --> 10:27.670
Here's two sovereigns.
I'll give you another two

10:27.753 --> 10:29.088
- when I see the pages.
- Done.

10:29.171 --> 10:31.424
Burbage, I will see you
hanged for a pickpocket.

10:31.507 --> 10:33.843
The Queen has commanded it.
She loves a comedy.

10:33.926 --> 10:36.470
And the Master of the Revels favours us.

10:36.554 --> 10:39.598
And what favour does Mr Tilney
receive from you?

10:39.682 --> 10:41.559
- Ask him.
- She comes!

11:07.960 --> 11:10.588
Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.840
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.

11:12.923 --> 11:16.052
Were it not affection
chains thy tender days...

11:19.513 --> 11:23.017
- When will you write me a sonnet, Will?
- I've lost my gift.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.437
You left it in my bed.
Come to look for it again.

11:32.985 --> 11:35.571
Are you to be my muse, Rosaline?

11:36.614 --> 11:40.409
Burbage has my keeping,
but you have my heart.

11:44.121 --> 11:46.665
You see?
The consumptives plot against me.

11:46.749 --> 11:50.544
Will Shakespeare has a play.
Let's go and cough through it.

11:52.630 --> 11:55.841
My father weeping,
my mother wailing,

11:55.925 --> 11:59.637
our maid howling,
our cat wringing her hands.

12:01.889 --> 12:07.103
Yet did not this coldhearted cur
shed one tear.

12:20.074 --> 12:21.742
You see? Comedy.

12:24.328 --> 12:27.665
Love, and a bit with a dog.
That's what they want.

12:35.798 --> 12:39.343
He is a stone, a very pebble stone,

12:39.427 --> 12:43.139
and has no more pity in him than a dog.

12:43.222 --> 12:46.434
A Jew would have wept
to have seen our parting.

12:46.517 --> 12:51.522
Now the dog all this while
sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word...

12:52.148 --> 12:56.402
Well played,
Master Crab! I commend you!

13:01.740 --> 13:06.287
What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?

13:07.538 --> 13:12.042
What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?

13:12.793 --> 13:15.588
Unless it be to think that she is by

13:15.671 --> 13:18.883
and feed upon the shadow of perfection,

13:20.885 --> 13:23.929
except I be by Silvia in the night,

13:24.013 --> 13:26.724
there is no music in the nightingale.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.227
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,

13:30.311 --> 13:32.897
there is no day for me to look upon.

13:57.546 --> 14:00.341
Did you like Proteus
or Valentine best?

14:00.799 --> 14:03.928
Proteus for speaking. Valentine for looks.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.347
I liked the dog for laughs.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.807
Silvia, I did not care for much.

14:08.891 --> 14:13.646
His fingers were red from fighting,
and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons.

14:14.271 --> 14:18.275
Stage love will never be true love
while the law of the land has our heroines

14:18.359 --> 14:21.487
being played by pipsqueak boys
in petticoats.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.533
- When can we see another?
- When the Queen commands it.

14:25.616 --> 14:27.618
No, but at the playhouse. Nurse!

14:27.701 --> 14:31.372
Now be still.
Playhouses are not for wellborn ladies.

14:31.455 --> 14:33.624
I'm not so wellborn.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.960
Well-moneyed is the same as wellborn,

14:36.043 --> 14:38.295
and well-married is more so.

14:38.837 --> 14:41.048
Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.

14:41.131 --> 14:43.592
All the men at court are without poetry.

14:43.676 --> 14:46.011
If they see me, they see my father's fortune.

14:46.095 --> 14:49.056
I will have poetry in my life,

14:50.432 --> 14:51.976
and adventure.

14:53.477 --> 14:56.230
And love. Love above all.

14:56.313 --> 14:58.190
Like Valentine and Silvia?

14:58.274 --> 15:01.902
No, not the artful postures of love,

15:02.278 --> 15:05.406
but love that overthrows life.

15:06.407 --> 15:09.952
Unbiddable, ungovernable,
like a riot in the heart,

15:10.035 --> 15:13.122
and nothing to be done,
come ruin or rapture.

15:14.582 --> 15:17.376
Love as there has never been in a play.

15:18.335 --> 15:22.256
I will have love, or I will end my days as...

15:22.339 --> 15:23.799
As a nurse?

15:25.342 --> 15:28.345
But I would be Valentine and Silvia, too.

15:29.263 --> 15:32.850
Good nurse, God save you, and good night.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.021
I would stay asleep my whole life

15:37.104 --> 15:40.441
if I could dream myself
into a company of players.

15:41.609 --> 15:44.403
Clean your teeth while you dream, then.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.241
Now spit.

16:13.474 --> 16:16.727
This time the boots are coming off.

16:17.061 --> 16:18.228
What have I done, Mr Fennyman?

16:18.312 --> 16:20.648
The theatres have all been closed down
by the plague.

16:20.731 --> 16:23.359
- Oh, that.
- By order of the Master of the Revels.

16:23.442 --> 16:27.321
Mr Fennyman, allow me to explain
about the theatre business.

16:27.905 --> 16:28.989
The natural condition

16:29.073 --> 16:32.618
is one of insurmountable obstacles
on the road to imminent disaster.

16:32.701 --> 16:34.662
- So what do we do?
- Nothing.

16:34.745 --> 16:37.915
- Strangely enough, it all turns out well.
- How?

16:39.249 --> 16:41.001
I don't know. It's a mystery.

16:41.085 --> 16:43.045
Shall I kill him, Mr Fennyman?

16:43.128 --> 16:49.176
The theatres are reopened
by order of the Master of the Revels!

16:49.259 --> 16:51.595
The theatres are reopened!

16:53.138 --> 16:56.850
Mr Fennyman.
Mr Tilney has reopened the playhouses.

16:56.934 --> 16:58.852
If you wouldn't mind.

17:02.856 --> 17:03.857
Where's the play?

17:04.358 --> 17:06.568
It's coming. It's coming.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.115
It's coming.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.044
Will!

17:24.837 --> 17:26.171
Will, I have wonderful news.

17:26.255 --> 17:28.716
So have I. <i>Romeo and Rosaline, Scene one.</i>

17:28.799 --> 17:30.342
God, I'm good!

17:31.135 --> 17:33.262
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.

17:38.809 --> 17:40.144
Richard?

17:42.646 --> 17:43.897
Burbage!

17:50.904 --> 17:52.489
Mr Tilney.

17:52.573 --> 17:55.784
Like you, I found him not at home.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.914
I would've made you immortal.

18:04.501 --> 18:07.629
Tell Burbage he has lost a new play
by Will Shakespeare.

18:07.713 --> 18:10.048
What does Burbage care of that?

18:10.132 --> 18:13.969
He's readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.

18:14.052 --> 18:17.514
- You've opened the playhouses?
- I have, Master Shakespeare.

18:17.598 --> 18:20.768
- But the plague?
- Yes, I know.

18:20.851 --> 18:23.353
But he was always hanging
around the house.

18:37.618 --> 18:41.622
The special today is a pig's foot
marinated in juniper berry vinegar,

18:41.705 --> 18:44.416
- served on a buckwheat pancake...
- Will!

18:44.500 --> 18:46.210
Have you finished?

18:46.668 --> 18:48.128
Yes, nearly.

18:48.212 --> 18:49.338
Good morning, Master Nol.

18:49.421 --> 18:51.340
- You will have a little nice part.
- Yes!

18:51.423 --> 18:55.344
- We'll need Ralph for the pirate king.
- Clear that bloody table!

18:56.637 --> 19:00.682
Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men
are out on tour. I need actors!

19:01.850 --> 19:05.646
Those of you who are unknown
will have a chance to be known!

19:05.729 --> 19:09.399
- What about the money, Mr Henslowe?
- It won't cost you a penny!

19:10.818 --> 19:12.945
Auditions in half an hour!

19:18.408 --> 19:19.993
Ralph Bagswell, I'd have a part for you,

19:20.077 --> 19:22.746
but, alas, I hear you are
a drunkard's drunkard.

19:22.830 --> 19:24.873
Never when I'm working.

19:25.415 --> 19:27.918
Never when I'm working!

19:29.127 --> 19:31.505
Get me to drink mandragora.

19:31.588 --> 19:33.257
Straight up, Will?

19:33.340 --> 19:35.425
Give my friend a beaker
of your best brandy.

19:36.718 --> 19:37.803
Kit.

19:38.929 --> 19:41.765
- How goes it, Will?
- Wonderful. Wonderful.

19:41.849 --> 19:46.019
- Burbage says you have a play.
- I have, and the chinks to show for it.

19:46.103 --> 19:48.730
I insist. A beaker for Mr Marlowe.

19:49.690 --> 19:52.109
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.653
- Not new. My <i>Doctor Faustus.</i>
- Ah.

19:54.945 --> 19:56.405
I love your early work.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.491
"Was this the face that
launched a thousand ships

19:59.575 --> 20:02.411
and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"

20:02.494 --> 20:07.040
I have a new one nearly finished, and better.
<i>The Massacre at Paris.</i>

20:08.792 --> 20:11.128
- Good title.
- Mmm. Yours?

20:12.421 --> 20:15.132
<i>Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.</i>

20:16.925 --> 20:18.552
Yes, I know. I know.

20:18.635 --> 20:20.304
What is the story?

20:21.305 --> 20:23.307
Well, there's this pirate...

20:26.602 --> 20:28.312
In truth, I have not written a word.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.273
Romeo.

20:32.107 --> 20:36.820
Romeo is Italian, always in and out of love.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.865
Yes, that's good. Until he meets...

20:40.324 --> 20:42.034
- Ethel.
- Do you think?

20:42.117 --> 20:44.870
- The daughter of his enemy.
- The daughter of his enemy.

20:44.953 --> 20:47.039
His best friend is killed in a duel

20:47.122 --> 20:50.542
by Ethel's brother, or something...
His name is Mercutio.

20:50.626 --> 20:52.836
Mercutio. Good name.

20:52.920 --> 20:56.173
- Will! They're waiting for you!
- Yes, I'm coming.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.926
Good luck with yours, Kit.

20:59.051 --> 21:02.596
- I thought your play was for Burbage.
- This is a different one.

21:02.846 --> 21:04.681
A different one you haven't written?

21:05.933 --> 21:10.103
Was this the face
that launched a thousand ships

21:10.187 --> 21:13.023
and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?

21:13.106 --> 21:14.316
Thank you.

21:14.399 --> 21:17.069
Was this the face that launched
a thousand ships

21:17.152 --> 21:19.780
- and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?
- Thank you!

21:19.863 --> 21:21.448
Was this the face

21:21.531 --> 21:25.577
that launched a thousand ships
and burnt the topless...

21:25.661 --> 21:29.581
I would like to give you something
from <i>Faustus</i> by Christopher Marlowe.

21:29.665 --> 21:32.501
- How refreshing.
- ...the topless towers of Ilium?

21:32.584 --> 21:35.504
Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.

21:39.591 --> 21:40.801
Was this the...

21:41.176 --> 21:44.054
Very good, Mr Wabash. Excellent.
Report to the property master.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.058
My tailor wants to be an actor.

21:48.850 --> 21:52.229
I have a few debts here and there.
Well, that seems to be everybody.

21:52.896 --> 21:55.065
- Did you see a Romeo?
- I did not.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.275
Well, I to my work, you to yours.

22:05.951 --> 22:07.077
May I begin, sir?

22:09.079 --> 22:11.123
- Your name?
- Thomas Kent.

22:12.207 --> 22:17.087
I would like to do a speech by a writer
who commands the heart of every player.

22:19.840 --> 22:23.468
What light is light,

22:24.970 --> 22:27.014
if Silvia be not seen?

22:29.016 --> 22:32.811
What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?

22:34.646 --> 22:36.606
Unless it be to think that she is by

22:36.690 --> 22:39.985
and feed upon the shadow of perfection,

22:42.612 --> 22:46.491
except I be by Silvia in the night,

22:47.993 --> 22:50.662
there is no music in the nightingale.

22:52.039 --> 22:55.250
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,

22:55.959 --> 22:58.587
there is no day for me to look upon.

23:00.547 --> 23:05.802
She is my essence, and I leave to be,
if I be not...

23:05.886 --> 23:08.805
- Take off your hat!
- My hat?

23:09.681 --> 23:11.433
Where'd you learn how to do that?

23:11.516 --> 23:13.977
- I...
- Let me see you. Take off your hat.

23:14.061 --> 23:17.105
- Are you Master Shakespeare?
- Wait there.

23:17.189 --> 23:18.273
Wait there!

23:31.787 --> 23:35.040
- Will, where are the pages?
- Where is the boy?

23:39.169 --> 23:40.670
Break a leg!

23:44.674 --> 23:47.219
Sir, will you buy my sweet orange?

24:06.404 --> 24:07.531
Hey!

24:29.719 --> 24:32.722
- Follow that boat!
- Right you are, governor.

24:37.853 --> 24:40.397
I know your face. Are you an actor?

24:41.106 --> 24:44.109
- Yes.
- Yes, I think I've seen you in something.

24:44.192 --> 24:46.570
- That one about a king.
- Really?

24:47.362 --> 24:49.656
I had that Christopher Marlowe
in my boat once.

25:02.711 --> 25:05.964
- Do you know that house?
- Sir Robert De Lesseps.

25:16.600 --> 25:20.270
Where is she?
Our guests are upon us!

25:20.812 --> 25:24.524
Lord Wessex, too, bargaining for a bride.

25:24.608 --> 25:27.360
My husband will have it settled tonight.

25:27.569 --> 25:30.197
Stamped, sealed and celebrated.

25:30.280 --> 25:33.325
Tomorrow he drags me off to the country,

25:33.408 --> 25:37.037
and it will be three weeks gone
before we return from our estates.

25:39.372 --> 25:40.624
God save you, Mother.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.418
Hot water, Nurse.

25:48.131 --> 25:49.591
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

25:49.674 --> 25:51.801
- Who, sir?
- The actor.

25:51.885 --> 25:54.221
- Who asks for him?
- Will Shakespeare.

25:54.304 --> 25:56.139
Poet, playwright of the Rose.

25:57.015 --> 26:00.185
Master Kent is my nephew.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.313
I will wait.

26:04.314 --> 26:06.358
Much good may it do you.

26:09.736 --> 26:13.823
<i>"Romeo Montague,
A Young Man of Verona."</i>

26:13.907 --> 26:15.533
Verona again?

26:15.617 --> 26:20.288
"A comedy of quarrelling families,
reconciled in the discovery of Romeo

26:20.372 --> 26:22.749
to be the very same Capulet cousin

26:22.832 --> 26:26.753
stolen from the cradle and fostered
to manhood by his Montague mother

26:26.836 --> 26:30.632
that was robbed of her own child
by the pirate king."

26:31.424 --> 26:32.801
Your mother and your father...

26:32.884 --> 26:36.179
From tomorrow,
away in the country for three weeks!

26:37.597 --> 26:39.349
Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

26:39.432 --> 26:41.977
- He looks well enough for a charlatan.
- Nurse!

26:42.060 --> 26:45.313
He would give Thomas Kent
the life of Viola De Lesseps' dreaming.

26:45.397 --> 26:48.233
My lady, when your parents return, I will tell.

26:48.316 --> 26:50.110
You will not tell.

26:50.193 --> 26:51.778
As I love you and as you love me,

26:51.861 --> 26:55.156
you will bind my breast
and buy me a boy's wig.

27:02.289 --> 27:04.124
Master Plum. What business here?

27:04.207 --> 27:07.919
The five shilling business, Will.
We play for the dancing.

27:27.230 --> 27:28.773
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

27:28.857 --> 27:31.943
Musicians don't eat. Sir Robert's orders.

27:33.069 --> 27:34.821
She's a beauty, my lord,

27:34.904 --> 27:38.116
as would take a king to church
for the dowry of a nutmeg.

27:38.199 --> 27:42.078
My plantations in Virginia
are not mortgaged for a nutmeg.

27:42.162 --> 27:44.414
I have an ancient name
which will bring you preferment

27:44.497 --> 27:46.666
when your grandson is a Wessex.

27:46.750 --> 27:48.668
- Is she fertile?
- She will breed.

27:49.252 --> 27:52.589
- If she do not, send her back.
- Is she obedient?

27:53.214 --> 27:54.841
As any mule in Christendom.

27:54.924 --> 27:59.346
But if you are the man to ride her,
there are rubies in the saddlebag.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.140
I like her.

28:22.452 --> 28:25.455
By all the stars in heaven. Who is she?

28:26.706 --> 28:29.709
Viola De Lesseps? Dream on, Will.

29:08.623 --> 29:10.375
Master Shakespeare.

29:17.507 --> 29:20.051
- My Lady Viola.
- My lord.

29:20.677 --> 29:23.263
I have spoken with your father.

29:23.346 --> 29:26.224
So, my lord? I speak with him every day.

29:44.075 --> 29:45.452
Good sir.

29:47.078 --> 29:49.080
I heard you were a poet.

29:53.042 --> 29:54.836
A poet of no words?

30:00.717 --> 30:01.885
Poet?

30:02.886 --> 30:06.473
I was a poet till now,
but I've seen beauty that puts my poems

30:06.556 --> 30:09.559
at one with the talking ravens in the Tower.

30:10.685 --> 30:13.688
- How do I offend, my lord?
- By coveting my property.

30:13.771 --> 30:16.441
I cannot shed blood in her house,
but I will cut your throat anon.

30:16.524 --> 30:18.276
Do you have a name?

30:19.277 --> 30:21.613
Christopher Marlowe, at your service.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.181
Romeo. Romeo.

30:48.515 --> 30:50.433
<i>A Young Man of Verona.</i>

30:51.476 --> 30:54.270
A comedy by William Shakespeare.

30:54.354 --> 30:56.856
- My lady!
- Who is there?

30:58.608 --> 31:00.693
- Will Shakespeare.
- Madam!

31:01.611 --> 31:03.821
Anon, good nurse, anon.

31:05.198 --> 31:08.117
- Master Shakespeare.
- The same, alas.

31:08.785 --> 31:09.827
But why "alas"?

31:09.911 --> 31:12.205
- A lowly player.
- "Alas," indeed.

31:12.664 --> 31:15.291
For I thought you
the highest poet of my esteem

31:15.375 --> 31:17.919
and a writer of plays that capture my heart.

31:18.002 --> 31:19.921
- I am him, too.
- Madam!

31:20.004 --> 31:23.007
Anon! I will come again.

31:25.218 --> 31:28.680
O, I am fortune's fool.
I will be punished for this.

31:31.641 --> 31:33.560
My lady, my love!

31:34.227 --> 31:36.521
If they find you here, they will kill you.

31:36.604 --> 31:40.316
- You can bring them with a word.
- Not for the world.

31:40.400 --> 31:43.278
- Madam!
- Anon!

32:42.879 --> 32:44.255
"Draw, if you be men

32:44.339 --> 32:46.466
Gregory, remember thy washing blow!"

32:46.549 --> 32:49.969
"Part, fools! Put up your swords.
You know not what you do."

32:50.053 --> 32:53.306
It starts well, then it's all long-faced
about some Rosaline.

32:53.389 --> 32:56.100
Where's the comedy, Will? Where's the dog?

32:56.184 --> 32:57.393
Do you think it's funny?

32:57.477 --> 33:01.064
I was a pirate king, now I'm a nurse.
That's funny.

33:01.147 --> 33:04.233
We are at least six men short, and those
we have will be overparted ranters

33:04.317 --> 33:06.361
and stutterers who should
be sent back to the stews.

33:06.444 --> 33:08.071
My Romeo's let me down. I see disaster.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.865
We're at least four acts short, Will,
if you're looking for disaster.

33:10.948 --> 33:13.117
- Sir!
- Who are you, master?

33:14.077 --> 33:16.871
I'm Ethel, sir, the pirate's daughter.

33:17.497 --> 33:19.582
I'll be damned if you are!

33:21.542 --> 33:23.252
Your attention, please!

33:23.628 --> 33:26.631
- Gentlemen, thank you!
- You are welcome.

33:26.714 --> 33:28.841
- Who's that?
- Nobody. He's the author.

33:28.925 --> 33:33.179
We are about to embark on a great voyage.

33:33.262 --> 33:36.099
It is customary to make a little speech
on the first day.

33:36.182 --> 33:37.934
It does no harm. Authors like it.

33:38.017 --> 33:42.188
You want to know what parts you are
to receive. All will be settled as we go...

33:42.271 --> 33:43.690
I'll do it.

33:44.232 --> 33:46.609
Now listen to me, you dregs.

33:46.693 --> 33:48.695
Actors are ten a penny,

33:48.778 --> 33:52.323
and I, Hugh Fennyman,
hold your nuts in my hand.

33:53.533 --> 33:54.784
Huzzah!

33:55.159 --> 33:57.870
The Admiral's Men
are returned to the house!

33:57.954 --> 33:59.622
Huzzah!

34:01.290 --> 34:02.417
Ned!

34:04.001 --> 34:05.336
Henslowe!

34:06.879 --> 34:08.797
Good to see you.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.554
Who is this?

34:14.637 --> 34:16.556
Silence, you dog!

34:18.181 --> 34:19.809
I am Hieronimo.

34:20.601 --> 34:22.311
I am Tamburlaine.

34:22.937 --> 34:24.397
I am Faustus.

34:24.480 --> 34:28.484
I am Barabas, the Jew of Malta.

34:30.820 --> 34:33.864
Yes, Master Will. I am Henry VI.

34:33.947 --> 34:37.409
What is the play, and what is my part?

34:37.493 --> 34:39.911
- One moment, sir...
- Who are you?

34:40.955 --> 34:42.290
I'm...

34:43.331 --> 34:44.876
I'm the money.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.962
Then you may remain,
so long as you remain silent.

34:48.045 --> 34:51.549
Pay attention. You will see
how genius creates a legend.

34:51.632 --> 34:52.592
Thank you, sir.

34:52.675 --> 34:55.094
We are in desperate want
of a Mercutio, Ned.

34:55.178 --> 34:57.638
- A young nobleman of Verona.
- Mmm-hmm.

34:57.722 --> 34:59.599
- And the title of this piece?
<i>- Mercutio.</i>

34:59.682 --> 35:00.892
Is it?

35:02.477 --> 35:04.103
I will play him.

35:05.813 --> 35:08.691
Mr Pope. Mr Philips. Welcome.

35:08.775 --> 35:11.027
George Bryan. James Armitage.

35:11.110 --> 35:13.196
Sam, my pretty one!

35:13.780 --> 35:17.116
- Are you ready to fall in love again?
- I am, Master Shakespeare.

35:17.200 --> 35:21.954
- Your voice. Have they dropped?
- No! No. A touch of cold only.

35:22.038 --> 35:25.666
Master Henslowe, you have your actors,
except Thomas Kent.

35:26.626 --> 35:29.253
I... I saw his Tamburlaine, you know.

35:29.337 --> 35:31.047
- It was wonderful.
- Yes, I saw it.

35:31.130 --> 35:34.967
Of course, such mighty writing.
There's no one like Marlowe.

35:49.607 --> 35:51.442
Better fortune, boy.

35:51.734 --> 35:53.319
I was in a play.

35:53.402 --> 35:56.447
They cut my head off in <i>Titus Andronicus.</i>

35:56.531 --> 35:59.450
When I write plays, they'll be like <i>Titus.</i>

35:59.742 --> 36:00.868
You admire it.

36:00.952 --> 36:05.665
I liked it when they cut heads off,
and the daughter mutilated with knives.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.292
- What's your name?
- John Webster.

36:09.460 --> 36:11.254
Here, kitty, kitty.

36:15.466 --> 36:17.301
Plenty of blood.

36:17.385 --> 36:19.428
That's the only writing.

36:20.513 --> 36:22.306
I have to get back.

36:22.390 --> 36:25.434
<i>See, where he comes.
So please you step aside.</i>

36:25.518 --> 36:27.520
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

36:27.603 --> 36:29.522
I would thou wert
so happy by thy stay,

36:29.605 --> 36:31.566
to hear true shrift. Come, madam.

36:31.649 --> 36:33.526
- Cut around him for now.
- What? Who?

36:33.609 --> 36:35.862
- Romeo.
- The one who came with your letter.

36:35.945 --> 36:38.030
- What?
- Good morrow, cousin.

36:38.114 --> 36:39.532
Is the day so young?

36:39.615 --> 36:43.452
- But new struck nine.
- Ay me! Sad hours seem long.

36:43.536 --> 36:46.163
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

36:46.247 --> 36:49.208
Not having that, which,
having, makes them short.

36:49.292 --> 36:50.710
- Good.
- In love?

36:50.793 --> 36:52.378
- Out...
- Of love?

36:52.461 --> 36:57.300
- Out of her favour, where I am in love.
- No, no, no. Don't spend it all at once.

36:59.468 --> 37:00.761
Yes, sir.

37:00.845 --> 37:03.723
- Do you understand me?
- No, sir.

37:04.557 --> 37:06.976
You're speaking about a baggage
we never even meet.

37:07.059 --> 37:09.353
What will be left in your purse
when he meets his Juliet?

37:09.437 --> 37:11.731
- Juliet? You mean Ethel.
- God's teeth!

37:11.814 --> 37:15.192
Am I to suffer this constant stream
of interruption?

37:17.570 --> 37:21.532
What will he do in Act Two,
when he meets the love of his life?

37:23.576 --> 37:26.746
I'm very sorry, sir.
I have not seen Act Two.

37:28.039 --> 37:30.625
Of course you have not.
I have not written it.

37:30.708 --> 37:32.209
Go once more.

37:33.252 --> 37:36.213
Will. Where is Mercutio?

37:37.173 --> 37:39.508
Locked safe in here. I'll leave the scene
in your safekeeping, Ned.

37:39.592 --> 37:40.968
I have a sonnet to write.

37:41.052 --> 37:43.179
Sonnet? You mean a play!

37:47.683 --> 37:50.686
<i>"For Lady Viola De Lesseps,</i>

37:51.312 --> 37:53.648
<i>by the hand of Thomas Kent."</i>

37:54.357 --> 37:56.859
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"

37:57.735 --> 38:00.488
<i>"Thou art more lovely and more temperate</i>

38:03.491 --> 38:06.369
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May..."

38:06.452 --> 38:08.371
Two hours at prayer!

38:08.537 --> 38:12.500
- Lady Viola is pious, my lord.
- Piety is for Sunday!

38:12.583 --> 38:15.503
And two hours of prayer is not piety,
it is self-importance.

38:15.586 --> 38:17.964
It would be better
that you return tomorrow, my lord.

38:18.047 --> 38:21.133
It would be better if you'd tell her to get off
her knees and show some civility

38:21.217 --> 38:23.594
to her six-day lord and master!

38:34.230 --> 38:35.940
My Lady Viola.

38:36.023 --> 38:38.818
Lord Wessex. You've been waiting.

38:38.901 --> 38:40.611
I am aware of it.

38:41.570 --> 38:43.322
But it is beauty's privilege.

38:44.115 --> 38:45.658
You flatter, my lord.

38:45.741 --> 38:48.786
No. I have spoken to the Queen.

38:49.912 --> 38:52.456
Her Majesty's consent is requisite
when a Wessex takes a wife,

38:52.540 --> 38:55.459
and once given,
her consent is her command.

38:55.543 --> 38:58.004
Do you intend to marry, my lord?

38:58.087 --> 39:00.339
Your father should keep you
better informed.

39:00.423 --> 39:02.466
He has bought me for you.

39:03.634 --> 39:07.722
He returns from his estates to see us
married two weeks from Saturday.

39:07.805 --> 39:09.890
You are allowed to show your pleasure.

39:12.101 --> 39:14.395
But I do not love you, my lord.

39:14.895 --> 39:17.273
How your mind hops about.

39:17.356 --> 39:19.608
Your father was a shopkeeper.

39:19.775 --> 39:22.028
Your children will bear arms,
and I will recover my fortune.

39:22.111 --> 39:25.239
That is the only matter
under discussion today.

39:25.322 --> 39:26.615
You will like Virginia.

39:27.283 --> 39:29.201
- Virginia?
- Yes.

39:29.285 --> 39:32.538
My fortune lies in my plantations.
The tobacco weed.

39:32.621 --> 39:36.042
I need 4,000 pounds to fit out a ship
and put my investments to work.

39:36.125 --> 39:38.419
I fancy tobacco has a future.

39:39.420 --> 39:42.131
We will not stay there long.
Three or four years.

39:43.758 --> 39:46.552
- But why me?
- It was your eyes.

39:48.095 --> 39:49.638
No, your lips.

40:00.649 --> 40:03.235
Will you defy your father and your queen?

40:03.319 --> 40:05.571
The Queen has consented?

40:05.654 --> 40:09.408
She wants to inspect you.
At Greenwich, come Sunday.

40:10.117 --> 40:15.331
Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.

40:18.209 --> 40:20.711
I will do my duty, my lord.

40:25.841 --> 40:29.637
<i>"Master Will,
poet dearest to my heart,</i>

40:30.513 --> 40:33.849
<i>I beseech you, banish me from yours."</i>

40:34.475 --> 40:36.644
<i>"I am to marry Lord Wessex."</i>

40:38.646 --> 40:43.025
<i>"A daughter's duty
and the Queen's command."</i>

41:05.172 --> 41:08.926
<i>Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage</i>

41:10.845 --> 41:14.640
<i>Gentlemen upstage
Ladies downstage</i>

41:14.723 --> 41:17.893
<i>Are you a lady, Mr Kent?</i>

41:17.977 --> 41:19.895
I'm very sorry, sir.

41:22.606 --> 41:25.067
We're gonna have to do it again.

41:26.735 --> 41:30.656
- You did not like the speech?
- No, the speech is excellent.

41:31.240 --> 41:34.368
"Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you."

41:35.035 --> 41:37.163
Excellent, and a good length.

41:37.246 --> 41:40.624
But then he disappears
for the length of a Bible.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.254
There. You have this duel.

41:45.337 --> 41:48.966
A skirmish of words and swords
such as I never wrote, nor anyone.

41:49.049 --> 41:53.637
He dies with such passion
and poetry as you ever heard.

41:54.138 --> 41:57.016
"A plague on both your houses!"

42:02.605 --> 42:03.939
He dies?

42:08.777 --> 42:11.739
Will! Where are my pages?

42:24.418 --> 42:26.629
Did you give her my letter?

42:27.588 --> 42:29.423
And this is for you!

42:43.020 --> 42:45.606
Thomas, she has cut my strings.

42:47.650 --> 42:51.320
I'm unmanned, unmended and unmade,

42:52.947 --> 42:54.907
like a puppet in a box.

42:54.990 --> 42:57.368
- Writer, is he?
- Row your boat!

42:57.785 --> 42:59.245
She tells me to keep away.

42:59.328 --> 43:02.998
She is to marry Lord Wessex!
What should I do?

43:03.082 --> 43:05.376
If you love her, you must do as she asks.

43:05.459 --> 43:08.295
- And break her heart and mine?
- It is only yours you can know.

43:08.379 --> 43:11.215
- She loves me, Thomas!
- Does she say so?

43:11.924 --> 43:13.217
No.

43:13.300 --> 43:15.094
And yet she does
where the ink has run with tears.

43:15.177 --> 43:18.013
Was she weeping when she gave you this?

43:19.348 --> 43:22.434
- Her letter came to me by the nurse.
- Your aunt.

43:22.518 --> 43:24.019
Yes, my aunt.

43:25.396 --> 43:27.731
But perhaps she wept a little.

43:30.192 --> 43:32.361
Tell me how you love her, Will.

43:32.444 --> 43:35.781
Like a sickness and its cure together.

43:36.740 --> 43:38.158
Yes.

43:39.201 --> 43:40.911
Like rain and sun.

43:41.537 --> 43:43.455
Like cold and heat.

43:45.332 --> 43:47.293
Is your lady beautiful?

43:48.043 --> 43:52.047
Since I came here from the country,
I have not seen her close.

43:52.631 --> 43:55.551
Tell me, is... Is she beautiful?

43:55.634 --> 43:59.638
Thomas, if I could write
the beauty of her eyes,

43:59.722 --> 44:02.725
I was born to look in them and know myself.

44:04.643 --> 44:06.812
- And her lips?
- Her lips?

44:07.396 --> 44:11.233
The early morning rose would wither
on the branch if it could feel envy.

44:11.317 --> 44:14.403
And her voice, like lark song?

44:14.486 --> 44:17.823
Deeper, softer. None of your twittering larks.

44:17.906 --> 44:21.243
I would banish nightingales from her garden
before they interrupt her song.

44:21.327 --> 44:23.746
- She sings, too?
- Constantly.

44:23.829 --> 44:27.499
Without doubt. And plays the lute.
She has a natural ear.

44:27.583 --> 44:31.670
And her bosom. Did I mention her bosom?

44:31.754 --> 44:33.422
What of her bosom?

44:33.505 --> 44:39.178
Thomas, a pair of pippins
as round and rare as golden apples.

44:39.261 --> 44:42.514
I think milady is wise
to keep your love at a distance.

44:42.598 --> 44:45.225
For what lady could live up to it, close to

44:45.309 --> 44:49.563
when her eyes and lips and voice
may be no more beautiful than mine.

44:51.565 --> 44:53.025
Besides, can a...

44:53.108 --> 44:55.235
Can a lady of wealth and noble marriage

44:55.319 --> 44:59.031
love happily with
a bankside poet and player?

44:59.114 --> 45:00.532
Yes, by God!

45:01.241 --> 45:03.952
Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank.

45:04.036 --> 45:07.498
It will spark between a queen and
the poor vagabond who plays the king.

45:07.581 --> 45:09.583
And their love should be minded by each,

45:09.666 --> 45:12.211
for love denied,
blights the soul we owe to God.

45:12.294 --> 45:15.631
So tell my lady William Shakespeare
waits for her in the garden.

45:15.714 --> 45:17.341
But what of Lord Wessex?

45:17.424 --> 45:21.261
For one kiss,
I would defy a thousand Wessexes.

45:29.478 --> 45:30.813
Will.

45:32.314 --> 45:34.108
Thank you, my lady.

45:36.485 --> 45:37.611
Lady?

45:37.694 --> 45:41.490
That's Viola De Lesseps.
Known her since she was this high.

45:42.032 --> 45:44.159
Wouldn't deceive a child.

45:45.327 --> 45:48.497
Strangely enough,
I'm a bit of a writer meself.

45:49.790 --> 45:52.292
It wouldn't take you long to read it.

45:52.376 --> 45:55.003
I expect you'd know all the booksellers!

46:04.179 --> 46:05.597
Can you love a fool?

46:06.432 --> 46:08.350
Can you love a player?

46:16.608 --> 46:17.776
Wait!

46:18.193 --> 46:22.531
You're still a maid, and perhaps as mistook
in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

46:22.614 --> 46:25.576
Are you the author of the plays
of William Shakespeare?

46:25.659 --> 46:26.618
I am.

46:26.702 --> 46:29.621
Then kiss me again, for I am not mistook.

46:42.843 --> 46:45.220
I do not know how to undress a man.

46:45.304 --> 46:47.431
It is strange to me, too.

48:01.672 --> 48:03.173
Go to. Go to.

48:10.931 --> 48:13.141
I would not have thought it.

48:14.142 --> 48:16.853
There is something better than a play.

48:17.187 --> 48:18.522
There is.

48:19.898 --> 48:21.483
- Even your play.
- Hmm...

48:24.570 --> 48:25.571
Huh?

48:27.614 --> 48:29.992
And that was only my first try.

48:51.179 --> 48:53.181
You would not leave me.

48:54.099 --> 48:57.352
I must. Look how pale the window.

48:57.686 --> 48:59.021
Moonlight.

48:59.855 --> 49:02.316
No. The morning rooster woke me.

49:02.941 --> 49:05.193
It was the owl. Come to bed.

49:07.696 --> 49:09.698
Let Henslowe wait.

49:12.868 --> 49:15.954
- Mr Henslowe?
- Let him be damned for his pages.

49:16.038 --> 49:17.789
No, no, no.

49:18.540 --> 49:20.959
There is time! It is still dark.

49:21.043 --> 49:24.379
- It's broad day. The rooster tells us so.
- It was the owl.

49:24.463 --> 49:27.132
Believe me, love, it was the owl.

49:28.342 --> 49:31.261
You would leave us players
without a scene to read today?

49:35.766 --> 49:39.394
My lady?
The house is stirring. It is a new day.

49:40.395 --> 49:42.189
It is a new world.

49:43.357 --> 49:45.859
Good pilgrim,
you do wrong your hand too much,

49:45.942 --> 49:48.654
which mannerly devotion shows in this.

49:48.737 --> 49:52.074
For saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch,

49:52.157 --> 49:54.910
and palm to palm is holy Palmers' kiss.

49:55.452 --> 49:59.456
Have not saints lips, and holy Palmers, too?

49:59.539 --> 50:03.377
Ay, pilgrim,
lips that they must use in prayer.

50:03.460 --> 50:07.005
O, then, dear saint,
let lips do what hands do.

50:07.089 --> 50:08.924
They pray,

50:09.007 --> 50:11.802
grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

50:12.511 --> 50:15.931
Saints do not move,
though grant for prayers' sake.

50:17.808 --> 50:18.850
It's you.

50:18.934 --> 50:20.686
Suffering cats!

50:22.145 --> 50:26.441
Then move not
while my prayer's effect I take.

50:31.905 --> 50:35.200
Thus from my lips,
by thine my sin is purged.

50:35.283 --> 50:37.869
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

50:37.953 --> 50:42.374
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged.
Give me my sin again.

50:42.457 --> 50:47.295
Yes, yes! Not quite right.
It is more... Let me.

50:48.255 --> 50:50.382
Then have my lips
the sin that they have took.

50:50.465 --> 50:55.095
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged.
Give me my sin again.

51:01.727 --> 51:06.148
- You kiss by the book.
- Well, Will! It was lucky you were here.

51:06.231 --> 51:08.692
- Why do not I write the rest of your play...
- Yes!

51:08.775 --> 51:11.653
Continue. Now the nurse. Where is Ralph?

51:13.280 --> 51:16.199
Madam,
your mother craves a word with you.

51:18.910 --> 51:21.121
- What is her mother?
- Marry, bachelor,

51:21.204 --> 51:24.332
her mother is the lady of the house,
and a good lady,

51:24.416 --> 51:26.418
and a wise and virtuous.

51:26.501 --> 51:29.588
I nursed her daughter, that you talked withal.

51:29.671 --> 51:33.967
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
shall have the chinks.

51:34.050 --> 51:35.927
- Is she a Capulet?
- Mmm.

51:36.595 --> 51:39.973
O dear account! My life is my foe's debt.

51:40.348 --> 51:43.143
Away. Begone.
The sport is at the best.

51:43.226 --> 51:45.979
Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest.

51:47.606 --> 51:50.859
Come hither, nurse.
What is yond gentleman?

51:51.276 --> 51:53.820
The son and heir of old Tiberio.

51:54.863 --> 51:56.072
Let it be night.

51:56.156 --> 51:58.617
What's he that
follows there, that would not dance?

51:58.700 --> 52:00.118
I know not.

52:00.202 --> 52:01.912
Go ask his name.

52:03.705 --> 52:06.875
If he be married,
my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

52:08.919 --> 52:10.337
No, do not go.

52:10.420 --> 52:12.464
I must. I must.

52:12.547 --> 52:14.424
RALPH
The only son of your great enemy.

52:14.508 --> 52:15.592
Terrible.

52:15.675 --> 52:17.928
Simply terrible!

52:24.684 --> 52:28.563
<i>"But, soft, what light
through yonder window breaks?"</i>

52:29.731 --> 52:32.901
"It is the east, and Juliet is the sun."

52:34.152 --> 52:37.989
"Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,

52:38.824 --> 52:41.618
who is already sick and pale with grief,

52:41.701 --> 52:45.413
that thou, her maid,
art far more fair than she."

52:46.665 --> 52:49.334
- Will.
- Yes, some of it's speakable.

52:49.417 --> 52:54.256
"It is my lady. O, it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!"

52:54.923 --> 52:58.677
"The brightness of her cheek
would shame those stars,

52:58.760 --> 53:01.096
as daylight doth a lamp."

53:01.179 --> 53:06.560
Her eyes in heaven would through
the airy region stream so bright

53:07.102 --> 53:10.564
that birds would sing
and think it were not night.

53:11.648 --> 53:14.776
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.

53:15.443 --> 53:20.532
O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
that I might touch that cheek!

53:20.615 --> 53:22.117
Ay, me.

53:22.784 --> 53:25.328
"O Romeo, Romeo."

53:26.121 --> 53:28.540
"Wherefore art thou Romeo?"

53:28.623 --> 53:32.377
"Deny thy father and refuse thy name."

53:32.460 --> 53:35.505
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,

53:36.131 --> 53:38.091
and I'll no longer be a Capulet.

53:38.174 --> 53:40.802
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

53:42.470 --> 53:45.056
"What man art thou that
thus bescreened in night

53:45.140 --> 53:47.475
so stumblest on my counsel?"

53:48.059 --> 53:51.229
<i>By a name I know not
how to tell thee who I am.</i>

53:51.730 --> 53:56.234
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
because it is an enemy to thee.

53:56.318 --> 53:59.112
Had I it written, I would tear the word.

53:59.696 --> 54:03.241
"The orchard walls are high
and hard to climb,

54:04.326 --> 54:07.370
and the place death,
considering who thou art,

54:07.454 --> 54:09.915
if any of my kinsmen find thee here."

54:09.998 --> 54:13.209
"If they do see thee, they will murder thee."

54:13.293 --> 54:17.756
Alack, there lies more
peril in thine eye than 20 of their swords.

54:17.839 --> 54:21.801
Look thou but sweet,
and I am proof against their enmity.

54:22.510 --> 54:24.304
I would not for the world
they saw thee here.

54:24.387 --> 54:27.349
I have night's cloak
to hide me from their eyes.

54:27.432 --> 54:30.310
And but thou love me, let them find me here.

54:30.393 --> 54:32.979
"Good night. Good night."

54:33.063 --> 54:37.943
"As sweet repose and rest come to thy heart
as that within my breast."

54:38.568 --> 54:40.946
"O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"

54:41.029 --> 54:44.449
- That's my line.
- It is mine, too.

54:44.532 --> 54:47.786
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

54:47.869 --> 54:50.121
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?

54:50.205 --> 54:53.500
The exchange
of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

54:54.042 --> 54:56.836
"My bounty
is as boundless as the sea,

54:57.587 --> 54:59.673
my love as deep."

55:00.173 --> 55:02.550
"The more I give to thee,

55:02.634 --> 55:06.388
- the more I have, for both are infinite."
- "...the more I have, for both are infinite."

55:08.515 --> 55:09.557
Madam?

55:09.891 --> 55:12.519
I hear some noise within. Dear love, <i>adieu.</i>

55:12.602 --> 55:13.728
Juliet!

55:14.020 --> 55:17.148
- "Anon, good nurse."
- Anon, good nurse.

55:17.232 --> 55:18.733
Sweet Montague, be true.

55:18.858 --> 55:21.695
"Stay but a little. I will come again."

55:21.778 --> 55:24.406
Stay but a little. I will come again.

55:24.489 --> 55:26.783
O blessed, blessed night.

55:28.743 --> 55:33.748
"I am afeared.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,

55:35.667 --> 55:39.963
too flattering sweet to be substantial."

55:43.299 --> 55:46.011
<i>To cease thy strife
and leave me to my grief.</i>

55:46.094 --> 55:47.929
A thousand times good night.

55:48.013 --> 55:50.223
A thousand times
the worse, to want thy light.

55:50.306 --> 55:54.019
I cannot move in this dress.
It makes me look like a pig.

55:55.186 --> 55:57.814
I've got no neck in this pig dress.

56:01.943 --> 56:04.279
- How is it?
- It's all right.

56:08.992 --> 56:11.578
Ned, I know, I know.

56:11.995 --> 56:13.496
It's good.

56:14.164 --> 56:15.165
Huh?

56:15.790 --> 56:17.584
The title won't do.

56:18.418 --> 56:19.419
Ah?

56:19.502 --> 56:22.714
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Just a suggestion.

56:25.133 --> 56:26.718
Thank you, Ned.

56:29.262 --> 56:33.183
- You are a gentleman.
- And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.

56:33.266 --> 56:36.227
- What o'clock tomorrow shall I send to thee?
- By the hour of nine.

56:36.311 --> 56:38.605
I shall not fail. 'Tis 20 years till then.

56:38.688 --> 56:40.356
I have forgot
why I called thee back.

56:40.440 --> 56:43.610
- You mean no dog of any kind?
- Shh. Silence.

56:44.778 --> 56:46.154
The friar marries them in secret,

56:46.237 --> 56:49.074
then Ned gets into a fight
with one of the Capulets.

56:49.157 --> 56:53.328
Romeo tries to stop them and he gets
in Ned's way. I mean, in Mercutio's way.

56:53.411 --> 56:56.623
So Tybalt kills Mercutio,
then Romeo kills Tybalt.

56:56.706 --> 56:59.417
And then the prince banishes him
from Verona.

56:59.501 --> 57:01.628
That must be when he goes on the voyage
and gets shipwrecked

57:01.711 --> 57:03.254
on the island of the pirate king.

57:03.338 --> 57:07.133
For God's sake,
cease your prattling and get out!

57:07.759 --> 57:09.052
Get out!

57:13.181 --> 57:15.058
A thousand apologies.

57:16.351 --> 57:17.602
Please.

57:19.312 --> 57:21.815
And with a silken thread
plucks it back again,

57:21.898 --> 57:23.817
so loving-jealous of his liberty.

57:23.900 --> 57:25.735
I would I were thy bird.

57:25.819 --> 57:29.823
Sweet, so would I,
yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.

57:30.573 --> 57:33.118
Good night. Good night.

57:33.743 --> 57:38.206
Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I
shall say good night till it be morrow.

57:46.339 --> 57:47.590
Sunday.

57:49.217 --> 57:50.677
'Tis Sunday.

57:58.393 --> 58:00.728
I found something in my sleep.

58:01.229 --> 58:04.858
The friar who married them
will take up their destinies.

58:05.525 --> 58:08.987
- But it will end well for love.
- In heaven, perhaps.

58:09.487 --> 58:12.073
It is not a comedy I'm writing now.

58:14.117 --> 58:16.578
A broad river divides my lovers.

58:17.412 --> 58:20.081
Family, duty, fate.

58:23.209 --> 58:25.336
As unchangeable as nature.

58:26.171 --> 58:27.297
Yes.

58:29.340 --> 58:31.342
This is not life, Will.

58:32.468 --> 58:34.387
It is a stolen season.

58:35.138 --> 58:36.723
- Be patient, my lord.
- Patient?

58:36.806 --> 58:40.268
- Do you ask Her Majesty to be patient?
- My lord, I'll go...

58:41.186 --> 58:43.062
Sunday. Greenwich!

58:47.150 --> 58:48.860
Now, pay attention, nursie.

58:48.943 --> 58:51.571
The Queen, Gloriana Regina,

58:51.654 --> 58:55.033
God's chosen vessel,
the radiant one who shines her light on us,

58:55.116 --> 58:58.203
is at Greenwich today,
and prepared during the evening's festivities

58:58.286 --> 59:01.539
to bestow her gracious favour
on my choice of wife.

59:01.623 --> 59:04.209
And if we're late for lunch,
the old boot will not forgive!

59:04.292 --> 59:08.713
Get you to my lady's chamber and produce
her with or without her undergarments!

59:08.796 --> 59:10.882
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!

59:10.965 --> 59:13.927
What will you have me do?
Marry you instead?

59:14.594 --> 59:16.888
To be the wife of a poor player.

59:16.971 --> 59:20.558
Can I wish that for Lady Viola
except in my dreams?

59:21.100 --> 59:24.562
And yet I would, if I were free to follow
my desire in the harsh light of day.

59:24.646 --> 59:27.315
You follow your desire
freely enough in the night.

59:27.398 --> 59:30.985
- So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
- Then I'll go with you.

59:31.069 --> 59:34.072
- You cannot. Wessex will kill you.
- I know how to fight.

59:34.572 --> 59:35.823
Stage fighting.

59:36.824 --> 59:38.159
Oh, Will.

59:40.078 --> 59:45.750
As Thomas Kent, my heart belongs to you,
but as Viola, the river divides us,

59:45.833 --> 59:48.920
and I must marry Wessex
a week from Saturday.

59:50.672 --> 59:52.966
I'll drag her down
by the Queen's command!

59:56.636 --> 59:57.887
Good morning, my lord.

59:57.971 --> 01:00:02.850
My lady. The tide waits for no man,
but I swear it would wait for you.

01:00:03.017 --> 01:00:06.771
Here we come at last, my lord!

01:00:07.397 --> 01:00:08.940
Are you bringing your laundrywoman?

01:00:11.401 --> 01:00:14.112
Her chaperone, my lady's country cousin.

01:00:14.195 --> 01:00:19.534
My, but you be a handsome gallant,
just as she said.

01:00:19.617 --> 01:00:21.577
You may call me Miss Wilhelmina.

01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:25.206
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps.

01:00:25.498 --> 01:00:28.209
Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off.

01:00:28.501 --> 01:00:32.422
She never needed me more.
I swear by your britches.

01:01:06.039 --> 01:01:07.415
- Now?
- Now.

01:01:08.041 --> 01:01:10.585
The Queen asks for you. Answer well.

01:01:13.963 --> 01:01:15.882
- Is there a man?
- A man, my lord?

01:01:15.965 --> 01:01:19.260
There was a man, a poet.
A theatre poet, I think.

01:01:19.969 --> 01:01:22.722
- Does he come to the house?
- A theatre poet?

01:01:22.805 --> 01:01:26.476
An insolent penny-a-page rogue!
Marlowe, he said. Christopher Marlowe.

01:01:26.559 --> 01:01:28.853
- Has he been to the house?
- Marlowe?

01:01:28.936 --> 01:01:33.483
Oh, yes. He is the one.
Lovely waistcoat. Shame about the poetry.

01:01:34.901 --> 01:01:36.235
That dog!

01:01:54.295 --> 01:01:55.797
Your Majesty.

01:01:56.506 --> 01:01:58.549
Stand up straight, girl.

01:02:02.678 --> 01:02:04.055
I've seen you.

01:02:05.014 --> 01:02:08.059
You are the one who comes to all
the plays at Whitehall, at Richmond.

01:02:08.142 --> 01:02:09.644
Your Majesty.

01:02:11.813 --> 01:02:13.272
What do you love so much?

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:17.568
- Your Majesty.
- Speak up, girl! I know who I am.

01:02:18.653 --> 01:02:22.782
Do you love stories of kings and queens?
Of feats of arms?

01:02:24.242 --> 01:02:27.286
- Or is it courtly love?
- I love theatre.

01:02:28.371 --> 01:02:31.332
To have stories acted for me
by a company of fellows is...

01:02:31.416 --> 01:02:35.044
They're not acted for you,
they are acted for me. And?

01:02:36.838 --> 01:02:40.091
- And I love poetry above all.
- Above Lord Wessex?

01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:45.888
My lord, when you can't find your wife
you better look for her at the playhouse.

01:02:48.683 --> 01:02:51.686
Playwrights teach us nothing about love.

01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:55.523
They make it pretty, they make it comical,
or they make it lust.

01:02:55.648 --> 01:02:58.109
- They cannot make it true.
- But they can.

01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:07.493
I mean, Your Majesty,
they do not, they have not,

01:03:07.577 --> 01:03:09.871
but I believe there is one who can.

01:03:11.205 --> 01:03:15.418
My Lady Viola is young
in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it.

01:03:15.501 --> 01:03:19.464
Nature and truth are the very enemies
of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

01:03:19.547 --> 01:03:21.799
I thought you were here
because you had none.

01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:31.976
- Well, no one will take your wager, it seems.
- £50.

01:03:35.021 --> 01:03:36.522
£50?

01:03:38.900 --> 01:03:41.903
A very worthy sum
on a very worthy question.

01:03:43.279 --> 01:03:46.657
Can a play show us the very truth
and nature of love?

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:51.746
I bear witness to the wager

01:03:52.079 --> 01:03:55.082
and will be the judge of it
as occasion arises.

01:03:57.919 --> 01:04:00.171
I have seen nothing to settle it yet.

01:04:01.631 --> 01:04:03.966
Are there no more fireworks?

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:08.346
They would be soothing after the
excitements of Lady Viola's audience.

01:04:09.263 --> 01:04:12.183
Have her, then, but you are a lordly fool.

01:04:12.266 --> 01:04:15.728
She's been plucked since I saw her last,
and not by you.

01:04:16.270 --> 01:04:18.564
It takes a woman to know it.

01:04:23.277 --> 01:04:24.862
Marlowe.

01:04:36.582 --> 01:04:37.708
Burbage?

01:04:39.544 --> 01:04:42.004
- Who's there?
- Marlowe.

01:04:45.299 --> 01:04:47.385
You are playing my Dr. Faustus
this afternoon.

01:04:47.468 --> 01:04:49.303
Don't spend yourself in sport.

01:04:49.512 --> 01:04:52.890
- What do you want, Kit?
- My <i>Massacre at Paris</i> is complete.

01:04:52.974 --> 01:04:56.310
- What? You have the last act?
- If you have the money.

01:04:56.852 --> 01:05:00.189
- Tomorrow.
- Then tomorrow you shall have the pages.

01:05:00.523 --> 01:05:02.567
Will you desist, madam!

01:05:04.652 --> 01:05:09.031
- £20 on delivery.
- Now, what is money to men like us?

01:05:10.283 --> 01:05:15.079
Besides, if I need a play, I have
another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.

01:05:15.162 --> 01:05:16.372
<i>Romeo.</i>

01:05:16.455 --> 01:05:17.456
Mmm-hmm.

01:05:17.999 --> 01:05:20.418
- Gave it to Henslowe.
- Never!

01:05:20.501 --> 01:05:23.588
Well, I'm to Deptford.
I leave you my respects, Miss Rosaline.

01:05:23.671 --> 01:05:26.716
I gave Shakespeare
two sovereigns for <i>Romeo.</i>

01:05:26.799 --> 01:05:27.842
You did,

01:05:27.925 --> 01:05:31.262
but Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men
have the playing of it at the Rose.

01:05:31.929 --> 01:05:33.264
Treachery!

01:05:34.473 --> 01:05:36.183
Traitor and thief!

01:05:40.021 --> 01:05:42.940
Oh, no. No.

01:06:02.418 --> 01:06:06.881
- By my head, here comes the Capulets.
- By my heel, I care not.

01:06:08.341 --> 01:06:10.176
<i>Follow me close, for I will speak to them.</i>

01:06:10.259 --> 01:06:13.554
Gentlemen, good den!
A word with one of you.

01:06:14.055 --> 01:06:15.765
Are you going to do it like that?

01:06:16.265 --> 01:06:18.142
<i>Positions.</i>

01:06:18.225 --> 01:06:20.227
<i>By my head,
here comes the Capulets.</i>

01:06:20.311 --> 01:06:22.313
<i>By my heel, I care not.</i>

01:06:22.396 --> 01:06:24.315
Follow me
close. I will speak to them.

01:06:24.398 --> 01:06:27.443
Gentlemen, good den!
A word with one of you.

01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:31.364
And but one word with one of us?

01:06:31.447 --> 01:06:34.200
Couple it with something.
Make it a word and a blow.

01:06:34.283 --> 01:06:37.953
Where's that thieving hack that
can't keep his pen in his ink pot?

01:06:38.037 --> 01:06:39.872
What is this rabble?

01:06:42.583 --> 01:06:44.543
Draw, if you be a man!

01:07:08.234 --> 01:07:10.152
Wonderful. Wonderful!

01:07:11.779 --> 01:07:13.531
And a dog.

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:17.535
No!

01:07:18.953 --> 01:07:21.455
I prithee, players! Please!

01:07:22.790 --> 01:07:24.709
Not with my props!

01:07:26.168 --> 01:07:28.421
- Will! What...
- A writers' quarrel.

01:07:29.755 --> 01:07:31.048
Quite normal.

01:07:33.134 --> 01:07:34.468
Stay hid.

01:07:48.274 --> 01:07:49.775
You are hurt.

01:08:03.164 --> 01:08:05.916
I dreamed last night of a shipwreck.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:11.005
- You were cast ashore in a far country.
- Not yet. Not yet.

01:08:11.172 --> 01:08:13.924
We need that
for the balcony scene.

01:08:14.008 --> 01:08:16.426
My investment! Lambert!

01:08:18.053 --> 01:08:19.471
Vengeance!

01:08:47.917 --> 01:08:53.171
A famous victory!
Kegs and legs open, and on the house!

01:08:53.923 --> 01:08:56.008
What happy hour.

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:58.886
- This is a tavern!
- It is also a tavern.

01:08:58.969 --> 01:09:03.057
- I remember you. The poet!
- Yes, William the Conqueror.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:06.727
One at a time. One at a time.

01:09:08.312 --> 01:09:12.483
He's a pretty one.
Tell me your story while I tickle your fancy.

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:19.448
- It's a house of ill repute.
- It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

01:09:19.532 --> 01:09:20.991
Come. There's no harm in a drink.

01:09:21.075 --> 01:09:26.913
You are welcome to
my best house. Here's to the Admiral's Men.

01:09:27.747 --> 01:09:31.085
- The Admiral's Men!
- The Admiral's Men!

01:09:54.441 --> 01:09:56.610
Well, I quite liked it.

01:09:57.319 --> 01:10:02.157
Master Kent,
you have not yet dipped your wick.

01:10:04.368 --> 01:10:05.744
My wick?

01:10:07.288 --> 01:10:11.041
Mr Fennyman, because you love the
theatre, you must have a part in my play.

01:10:11.125 --> 01:10:15.129
I am writing an apothecary,
a small but vital role.

01:10:16.297 --> 01:10:18.924
My heavens. I thank you.

01:10:19.383 --> 01:10:23.971
- What's the play about, then?
- Well, there's this nurse...

01:10:28.934 --> 01:10:31.061
Silence, silence, silence!

01:10:32.646 --> 01:10:34.315
Master Shakespeare

01:10:35.399 --> 01:10:38.819
has asked me to play
the part of the apothecary.

01:10:41.196 --> 01:10:42.823
The apothecary?

01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:47.161
Will, what is this story?
Where is the shipwreck?

01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.413
How does the comedy end?

01:10:49.496 --> 01:10:51.123
By God, I wish I knew.

01:10:51.206 --> 01:10:53.584
By God,
if you do not, who does?

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:57.338
Let us have pirates,
clowns and a happy ending,

01:10:57.421 --> 01:11:00.424
or we shall send you
back to Stratford to your wife.

01:11:18.275 --> 01:11:20.444
Will! Mr Henslowe! Gentlemen all!

01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:23.822
A black day for us all!
There is news from a tavern in Deptford.

01:11:23.906 --> 01:11:25.282
Marlowe is dead.

01:11:31.121 --> 01:11:32.289
Stabbed.

01:11:33.332 --> 01:11:35.834
Stabbed to death in a tavern at Deptford.

01:11:40.506 --> 01:11:41.882
What have I done?

01:11:42.758 --> 01:11:46.887
He was the first man among us.
A great light has gone out.

01:12:04.029 --> 01:12:05.406
Forgive me.

01:12:08.951 --> 01:12:10.577
God forgive me.

01:12:37.688 --> 01:12:39.982
Our Lord Jesus Christ's sake.

01:12:40.941 --> 01:12:43.527
<i>One morning in the month of May</i>

01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:46.113
<i>From my cot I stray</i>

01:12:46.613 --> 01:12:49.241
<i>Just at the dawning of the day</i>

01:12:49.324 --> 01:12:52.077
<i>I met with a charming maid</i>

01:12:54.121 --> 01:12:57.332
You look sad, my lady.
Let me take you riding.

01:12:57.958 --> 01:13:01.295
- It's not my riding day, my lord.
- Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

01:13:02.337 --> 01:13:05.466
- I'm going to church.
- Of course. I understand.

01:13:05.799 --> 01:13:11.096
- It is to be expected.
- Yes, it is to be expected on Sunday.

01:13:11.472 --> 01:13:13.307
And on a day of mourning.

01:13:14.892 --> 01:13:17.811
I never met the fellow
but once at your house.

01:13:18.729 --> 01:13:19.938
Mourning?

01:13:23.108 --> 01:13:24.485
Who is dead, my lord?

01:13:25.235 --> 01:13:26.320
Oh.

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:29.490
Dear God, I did not think it would be me
to tell you.

01:13:30.199 --> 01:13:33.202
Great loss to playwriting and to dancing.

01:13:36.163 --> 01:13:37.414
My lady.

01:13:37.498 --> 01:13:40.584
- He is dead?
- Killed last night in a tavern.

01:13:43.253 --> 01:13:45.172
Come then. We'll say a prayer for his soul.

01:14:29.883 --> 01:14:33.887
Spare me, dear ghost.
Spare me, dear ghost.

01:14:35.055 --> 01:14:38.142
Spare me, for the love of Christ. Spare me!

01:14:52.197 --> 01:14:55.409
Will! My love.

01:14:57.119 --> 01:14:58.412
I thought you were dead.

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:05.085
It is worse.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.755
I've killed a man.

01:15:12.926 --> 01:15:15.762
Marlowe's touch
was in my <i>Titus Andronicus,</i>

01:15:15.846 --> 01:15:19.308
and my <i>Henry VI</i> was a house built
on his foundations.

01:15:20.684 --> 01:15:24.313
- You never spoke so well of him.
- He was not dead before.

01:15:27.107 --> 01:15:31.612
I would exchange all my plays to come
for all of his that will never come.

01:15:32.654 --> 01:15:33.947
You lie.

01:15:36.450 --> 01:15:39.286
You lie by this river as you lied in my bed.

01:15:40.787 --> 01:15:42.539
My love is no lie.

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:45.626
I have a wife, yes,

01:15:46.919 --> 01:15:50.130
and I cannot marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

01:15:50.964 --> 01:15:53.926
You needed no wife come from Stratford
to tell you that,

01:15:55.427 --> 01:15:59.264
- and yet, you let me come to your bed.
- Calf-love.

01:16:02.017 --> 01:16:05.354
I loved the writer
and gave up the prize for a sonnet.

01:16:06.939 --> 01:16:08.649
I was the more deceived.

01:16:10.651 --> 01:16:14.821
Yes, you were deceived,
for I did not know how much I loved you.

01:16:18.283 --> 01:16:19.910
I love you, Will,

01:16:21.662 --> 01:16:24.748
- beyond poetry.
- My love.

01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:29.920
- You ran from me before.
- When I thought you dead, I did not care

01:16:30.003 --> 01:16:32.339
about all the plays that would never come,

01:16:32.422 --> 01:16:34.591
only that I would never see your face.

01:16:35.509 --> 01:16:38.345
I saw our end, and it will come.

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:43.225
- You cannot marry Wessex.
- If not you, why not Wessex?

01:16:43.308 --> 01:16:45.769
If not Wessex,
the Queen will know the cause,

01:16:45.852 --> 01:16:48.605
- and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
- No.

01:16:48.981 --> 01:16:49.982
No.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:55.070
But I will go to Wessex
as a widow from these vows,

01:16:55.529 --> 01:16:58.407
as solemn as they are unsanctified.

01:16:59.992 --> 01:17:02.536
For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt,

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:06.123
the one who killed
Romeo's friend Mercutio,

01:17:06.206 --> 01:17:09.918
Romeo is banished.
But the friar who married Romeo and Juliet...

01:17:10.002 --> 01:17:12.421
- Is that me, Will?
- You, Edward.

01:17:12.504 --> 01:17:15.882
The friar who married them
gives Juliet a potion to drink.

01:17:16.216 --> 01:17:19.386
It is a secret potion.
It makes her seeming dead.

01:17:19.886 --> 01:17:22.514
She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets.

01:17:22.597 --> 01:17:25.976
She will awake to life and love
when Romeo comes to her side again.

01:17:28.979 --> 01:17:30.564
I have not said all.

01:17:32.107 --> 01:17:36.236
By maligned fate, the message goes astray
which would tell Romeo of the friar's plan.

01:17:38.155 --> 01:17:40.198
He hears only that Juliet is dead.

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:44.828
- And thus he goes to the apothecary...
- That's me.

01:17:45.495 --> 01:17:47.581
...and buys a deadly poison.

01:17:48.290 --> 01:17:52.502
He enters the tomb to say farewell
to Juliet who lies there cold as death.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.797
He drinks the poison.

01:17:57.299 --> 01:17:59.134
He dies by her side

01:18:00.802 --> 01:18:03.430
and then she wakes and sees him dead.

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:07.434
And so Juliet takes his dagger

01:18:09.561 --> 01:18:11.563
and kills herself.

01:18:15.859 --> 01:18:18.320
Well, that will have them rolling
in the aisles.

01:18:18.403 --> 01:18:21.239
Sad and wonderful.

01:18:22.783 --> 01:18:28.747
I have a blue velvet cap that'll do well.
I've seen just such a cap on an apothecary.

01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:30.123
Just so.

01:18:31.583 --> 01:18:34.419
Yes, it will serve.

01:18:36.922 --> 01:18:38.924
But there's a scene missing.

01:18:39.883 --> 01:18:41.760
Between marriage and death?

01:18:48.308 --> 01:18:49.518
The play

01:18:51.186 --> 01:18:52.479
all written out for you.

01:18:53.980 --> 01:18:58.235
I had the clerk at Bridewell do it.
He has a good fist for lettering.

01:19:01.488 --> 01:19:03.031
There is a new scene.

01:19:10.038 --> 01:19:14.376
- Will you read in for me?
- "Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day."

01:19:15.836 --> 01:19:19.631
"It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear."

01:19:19.714 --> 01:19:24.845
"Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."

01:19:26.054 --> 01:19:31.268
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
no nightingale."

01:19:32.853 --> 01:19:38.650
"Look, love, what envious streaks
do lace the severing clouds in yonder east."

01:19:39.943 --> 01:19:42.279
"Night's candles are burnt out,

01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:48.368
and jocund day
stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops."

01:19:49.703 --> 01:19:54.082
"I must be gone and live, or stay and die."

01:19:55.959 --> 01:19:58.879
"Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I."

01:20:00.046 --> 01:20:06.386
"It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
to be to thee this night a torch-bearer,

01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:10.390
to light thee on thy way to Mantua."

01:20:12.726 --> 01:20:14.561
"Therefore stay yet."

01:20:16.188 --> 01:20:18.732
"Thou need'st not to be gone."

01:20:18.815 --> 01:20:22.861
"Let me be ta'en,
let me be put to death."

01:20:24.237 --> 01:20:27.532
"I am content, so thou wilt have it so."

01:20:28.450 --> 01:20:32.537
"I have more care to stay than will to go."

01:20:33.663 --> 01:20:37.542
"Come, death, and welcome!
Juliet wills it so."

01:21:02.609 --> 01:21:04.653
You will go far, I fear.

01:21:09.574 --> 01:21:11.493
I hope we work together again.

01:21:14.246 --> 01:21:17.582
"Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law

01:21:17.666 --> 01:21:21.711
is death...
Death to any he that utters them."

01:21:22.754 --> 01:21:25.090
Then him. Then me.

01:21:25.715 --> 01:21:29.511
"Put this in any liquid thing you will and..."

01:21:29.594 --> 01:21:32.180
What is it? What is it?

01:21:34.474 --> 01:21:37.894
"How silver-sweet
sound lovers' tongues by night,

01:21:37.978 --> 01:21:39.896
- like softest music..."
- Shakespeare!

01:21:57.831 --> 01:22:03.461
Upstart inky pup!
I'll show you your place, which is in hell!

01:22:07.882 --> 01:22:11.219
- You're on my ground now!
- By God, I'll fight the lot of you!

01:22:11.303 --> 01:22:13.346
I am more than enough!

01:22:21.146 --> 01:22:22.314
Move!

01:23:45.271 --> 01:23:46.606
Absent friends.

01:23:48.817 --> 01:23:50.985
This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!

01:23:52.779 --> 01:23:53.863
Will?

01:23:53.947 --> 01:23:55.740
I rejoiced in his death
because I thought it was yours!

01:23:55.824 --> 01:23:57.409
That's all I know of Marlowe!

01:23:57.951 --> 01:24:00.412
Will? It's true.

01:24:01.496 --> 01:24:03.581
It was a tavern brawl.

01:24:04.499 --> 01:24:08.128
Marlowe attacked
and got his own knife in the eye.

01:24:09.504 --> 01:24:15.051
- A quarrel about the bill.
- The bill? Vanity, vanity!

01:24:15.135 --> 01:24:17.137
Not the billing, the bill!

01:24:22.642 --> 01:24:25.645
- Oh, God. I am free of it.
- Where is she?

01:24:28.148 --> 01:24:30.442
- Close it.
- My Lord Wessex.

01:24:30.525 --> 01:24:33.903
The Rose harbours the ass
that shits on my name!

01:24:33.987 --> 01:24:35.447
Take it down stone by stone.

01:24:35.530 --> 01:24:38.992
I want it ploughed into the ground
and sown with quicklime!

01:24:39.909 --> 01:24:44.247
- Mr Tilney, what is this?
- Sedition and indecency.

01:24:44.330 --> 01:24:46.958
Master of the Revels, sir.
She's over here.

01:24:47.041 --> 01:24:48.835
- Where, boy?
- There.

01:24:50.128 --> 01:24:51.671
I saw her bubbies.

01:24:51.963 --> 01:24:56.217
So, a woman on the stage!

01:24:56.301 --> 01:25:00.305
A woman! I say this theatre is closed!

01:25:01.055 --> 01:25:06.269
- Why, sir?
- For lewdness and unshamedfacedness!

01:25:06.352 --> 01:25:11.357
And for displaying a female
on the public stage!

01:25:26.539 --> 01:25:28.166
Not him, her!

01:25:32.378 --> 01:25:33.588
That's who I meant.

01:25:36.633 --> 01:25:39.052
- He's a woman.
- This theatre is closed.

01:25:41.346 --> 01:25:43.264
Notice will be posted!

01:25:45.809 --> 01:25:47.894
Ned, I swear,
I knew nothing of this.

01:25:48.812 --> 01:25:49.813
Nobody knew.

01:25:49.896 --> 01:25:52.482
He did.
I saw him kissing her bubbies.

01:25:56.569 --> 01:26:01.074
- It is over.
- I'm so sorry, Mr Henslowe.

01:26:16.714 --> 01:26:21.845
I wanted to be an actor. I'm so sorry, Will.

01:26:28.393 --> 01:26:31.437
You were...

01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:35.441
Wonderful.

01:26:36.401 --> 01:26:37.777
Thank you.

01:26:48.413 --> 01:26:51.708
"Put this in any liquid thing you will and..."

01:26:58.089 --> 01:26:59.632
Everything all right?

01:27:38.046 --> 01:27:39.923
I would've been good.

01:27:41.382 --> 01:27:44.385
- I would've been great.
- So would I.

01:27:44.469 --> 01:27:46.012
We both would.

01:28:09.202 --> 01:28:11.245
Lambert, kill him.

01:28:13.915 --> 01:28:15.500
That can wait.

01:28:19.087 --> 01:28:23.883
The Master of the Revels despises us all
for vagrants and pedlars of bombast.

01:28:25.885 --> 01:28:28.304
But my father, James Burbage,

01:28:28.388 --> 01:28:32.600
had the first licence to make a company
of players from Her Majesty,

01:28:32.684 --> 01:28:36.354
and he drew from poets
the literature of the age.

01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.732
We must show them
that we are men of parts.

01:28:41.109 --> 01:28:42.735
Will Shakespeare has a play.

01:28:44.445 --> 01:28:47.949
I have a theatre. The Curtain is yours.

01:29:22.692 --> 01:29:25.611
Will, we'll be needing a Romeo.

01:29:32.618 --> 01:29:34.662
Oranges! Sweet oranges!

01:30:02.648 --> 01:30:07.445
My ship is moored at Bankside,
bound for Virginia on the afternoon tide.

01:30:07.528 --> 01:30:10.740
Please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps.
You are gaining a colony.

01:30:10.823 --> 01:30:16.412
And you, my lord, are gaining £5,000
by these drafts in my hand.

01:30:16.496 --> 01:30:20.625
Would you oblige me with 50 or so in gold
just to settle my accounts at the dockside?

01:30:23.836 --> 01:30:26.339
Ah! The bride!

01:30:28.132 --> 01:30:30.051
Good morning, my lord.

01:30:30.802 --> 01:30:34.972
I see you are open for business,
so let's to church.

01:30:41.062 --> 01:30:42.355
Be gone!

01:31:40.288 --> 01:31:42.039
My lord!

01:31:42.123 --> 01:31:44.625
- Be good to her, my lord.
- I will.

01:31:44.709 --> 01:31:46.460
God bless you!

01:31:47.003 --> 01:31:49.839
Thank you. Let go.
There's a good nurse.

01:31:49.922 --> 01:31:55.845
The tide will not wait! Farewell!
You'll all be welcome in Virginia!

01:32:23.289 --> 01:32:28.544
Apples! Juicy apples!
Buy my apples!

01:32:46.479 --> 01:32:48.314
Is this all right?

01:33:04.956 --> 01:33:09.669
Licentiousness is made a show!
Vice is made a show!

01:33:10.127 --> 01:33:14.548
Vanity and pride likewise made a show!

01:33:14.632 --> 01:33:18.844
This is the very business of show!

01:33:37.780 --> 01:33:39.949
"Two households."

01:33:40.032 --> 01:33:42.618
- We're lost.
- No, it will turn out well.

01:33:42.702 --> 01:33:46.330
- How will it?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:51.437
Two households, both alike in dignity,

01:34:52.813 --> 01:34:56.776
in fair Verona, where we lay our scene,

01:34:57.651 --> 01:35:00.654
from ancient grudge break to new mutiny,

01:35:00.738 --> 01:35:03.991
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.

01:35:04.075 --> 01:35:09.872
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
a pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,

01:35:10.289 --> 01:35:13.167
whose misadventured piteous overthrows

01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:16.462
doth with their death
bury their parents' strife.

01:35:19.632 --> 01:35:22.718
The which if you with patient ears attend,

01:35:22.802 --> 01:35:27.139
what here shall miss,
our toil shall strive to mend.

01:35:34.146 --> 01:35:37.900
- Wonderful.
- Was it good?

01:35:42.029 --> 01:35:45.157
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

01:35:45.241 --> 01:35:48.244
No, for then we should be colliers.

01:35:48.327 --> 01:35:50.746
I mean, an we be in choler...

01:35:50.830 --> 01:35:53.082
- Master Shakespeare.
- Luck be with you, Sam.

01:35:53.999 --> 01:35:57.378
- Sam!
- It's not my fault. I could do it yesterday.

01:35:57.461 --> 01:35:59.839
Do me a speech. Do me a line.

01:36:00.464 --> 01:36:02.133
"Parting is such sweet sorrow."

01:36:03.217 --> 01:36:07.179
- Another little problem.
- What do we do now?

01:36:07.263 --> 01:36:11.100
- The show must... You know.
- Go on!

01:36:11.517 --> 01:36:14.186
Juliet does not come on for 20 pages.
It will be all right.

01:36:14.270 --> 01:36:17.106
- How will it?
- I don't know. It's a mystery.

01:36:21.652 --> 01:36:22.736
Let them begin.

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:24.655
I will frown as I pass by.

01:36:24.738 --> 01:36:26.615
Let them take it as they list.

01:36:26.699 --> 01:36:28.617
Nay, as they dare.

01:36:28.701 --> 01:36:32.830
I will bite my thumb at them,
which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

01:36:33.914 --> 01:36:36.250
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

01:36:36.333 --> 01:36:38.544
I do bite my thumb, sir.

01:36:39.086 --> 01:36:42.214
- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
- Thank you. Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:36:43.132 --> 01:36:44.967
- Can we talk?
- Shh.

01:36:45.050 --> 01:36:47.678
- We have no Juliet.
- No Juliet?

01:36:47.761 --> 01:36:50.681
- No Juliet?
- It'll be all right, madam.

01:36:50.764 --> 01:36:52.016
What happened to Sam?

01:36:52.099 --> 01:36:54.185
- Who are you?
- Thomas Kent.

01:36:55.728 --> 01:36:56.896
Do you know it?

01:36:58.856 --> 01:37:00.107
Every word.

01:37:10.117 --> 01:37:12.995
I'll go along,
no such sight to be shown,

01:37:13.078 --> 01:37:15.998
but to rejoice in splendour of mine own.

01:37:17.791 --> 01:37:19.001
Nurse,

01:37:21.545 --> 01:37:24.548
where's my daughter?
Call her forth to me.

01:37:24.632 --> 01:37:27.885
Now, by my maidenhead, at 12 years old,

01:37:27.968 --> 01:37:29.053
I bade her come.

01:37:29.136 --> 01:37:31.680
"How now! Who calls?
How now..."

01:37:32.515 --> 01:37:36.769
What, ladybird!
God forbid! Where's this girl?

01:37:37.603 --> 01:37:40.856
What, lamb! What, ladybird!

01:37:43.025 --> 01:37:45.236
What, Juliet!

01:37:46.153 --> 01:37:47.947
How now! Who calls?

01:37:53.702 --> 01:37:56.872
- We'll all be put in the Clink.
- See you in jail.

01:38:00.376 --> 01:38:03.504
- Your mother.
- Your mother.

01:38:03.629 --> 01:38:06.799
Madam, I am here. What is your will?

01:38:07.216 --> 01:38:09.134
This is the matter.

01:38:09.218 --> 01:38:11.637
Nurse, give leave awhile.
We must talk in secret.

01:38:12.304 --> 01:38:16.183
Nurse, come back again. I have
remembered me, thou's hear our counsel.

01:38:16.267 --> 01:38:19.895
Thou know'st my daughter's
of a pretty age.

01:38:19.979 --> 01:38:22.398
Faith, I know her age unto an hour.

01:38:22.481 --> 01:38:23.607
She's not 14.

01:38:24.108 --> 01:38:27.111
I'll lay 14 of my teeth.

01:38:27.194 --> 01:38:30.614
And yet to my teen be it spoken
I have but four.

01:38:54.388 --> 01:38:55.973
Tell me, daughter Juliet,

01:38:56.056 --> 01:38:59.268
how stands your disposition to be married?

01:39:00.811 --> 01:39:03.522
It is an honour that I dream not of.

01:39:06.734 --> 01:39:07.735
Benvolio!

01:39:09.987 --> 01:39:10.988
Good Mercutio!

01:39:20.873 --> 01:39:22.166
I am sped.

01:39:22.249 --> 01:39:24.960
Courage, man, the hurt cannot be much.

01:39:25.878 --> 01:39:29.548
Ask for me tomorrow,
and you shall find me a grave man.

01:39:48.108 --> 01:39:52.321
"Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law

01:39:52.404 --> 01:39:55.491
is death to any he that utters them."

01:39:55.574 --> 01:39:57.910
Then him. Then me.

01:40:06.460 --> 01:40:08.587
Romeo, away! Be gone!

01:40:08.671 --> 01:40:12.424
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amazed.

01:40:13.258 --> 01:40:17.304
The prince will doom thee death
if thou art taken. Hence! Be gone! Away!

01:40:18.430 --> 01:40:20.933
O, I am fortune's fool.

01:40:21.433 --> 01:40:23.018
Why dost thou stay?

01:40:24.395 --> 01:40:26.021
Which way
ran he that killed Mercutio?

01:40:26.105 --> 01:40:27.356
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

01:40:27.439 --> 01:40:28.691
There lies that Tybalt.

01:40:28.774 --> 01:40:30.025
Up, sir, go with me.

01:40:30.109 --> 01:40:31.860
I charge thee in the prince's name, obey.

01:40:31.944 --> 01:40:34.988
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

01:40:35.072 --> 01:40:37.199
O, I am fortune's fool.

01:40:40.661 --> 01:40:42.204
You are married?

01:40:46.625 --> 01:40:50.462
If you be married,
my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

01:41:06.603 --> 01:41:08.313
Art thou gone so?

01:41:11.525 --> 01:41:15.612
Love, lord, ay, husband, friend.

01:41:16.905 --> 01:41:19.908
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,

01:41:20.909 --> 01:41:23.787
for in a minute there are many days.

01:41:24.204 --> 01:41:29.334
O, by this count I shall be much in years
ere I again behold my Romeo!

01:41:30.878 --> 01:41:32.045
Farewell!

01:41:33.547 --> 01:41:36.341
O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

01:41:39.011 --> 01:41:44.016
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,
as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:48.854
Either my eyesight fails,
or thou look'st pale.

01:41:50.939 --> 01:41:54.943
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.

01:41:56.195 --> 01:41:58.405
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.

01:42:05.204 --> 01:42:07.956
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,

01:42:08.123 --> 01:42:11.210
and this distilled liquor drink thou off.

01:42:11.502 --> 01:42:15.464
No warmth, no breath,
shall testify thou livest,

01:42:15.547 --> 01:42:18.425
and in this borrowed likeness
of shrunk death

01:42:18.509 --> 01:42:21.637
thou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.515
and then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

01:42:25.641 --> 01:42:27.559
What, ho! Apothecary!

01:42:31.146 --> 01:42:34.775
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.

01:42:35.317 --> 01:42:37.903
Hold, there is 40 ducats.

01:42:38.654 --> 01:42:41.573
- Let me have a dram of poison.
- Such mortal drugs I have,

01:42:41.657 --> 01:42:45.744
but Mantua's law is death
to any he that utters them.

01:42:46.245 --> 01:42:49.414
- Art thou so...
- My poverty, but not my will, consents.

01:42:55.128 --> 01:42:57.589
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

01:43:01.802 --> 01:43:03.720
Eyes, look your last!

01:43:04.388 --> 01:43:10.477
Arms, take your last embrace!
And, lips, O you

01:43:11.144 --> 01:43:15.148
the doors of breath,
seal with a righteous kiss

01:43:17.442 --> 01:43:21.446
a dateless bargain to engrossing death!

01:43:23.282 --> 01:43:29.246
Come, bitter conduct.
Come, unsavoury guide!

01:43:29.997 --> 01:43:34.001
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on

01:43:34.084 --> 01:43:38.380
the dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!

01:43:38.881 --> 01:43:40.632
Here's to my love!

01:43:48.473 --> 01:43:52.144
O true apothecary!

01:43:55.981 --> 01:43:57.816
Thy drugs are quick.

01:44:03.697 --> 01:44:05.490
Thus with a kiss

01:44:07.993 --> 01:44:09.161
I die.

01:44:27.930 --> 01:44:29.681
Where is my lord?

01:44:31.892 --> 01:44:36.063
I do remember well where I should be,
and there I am. Where is my Romeo?

01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:37.397
Dead!

01:44:50.786 --> 01:44:55.040
What's this?
A cup, closed in my true love's hand?

01:44:58.460 --> 01:45:01.380
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.

01:45:07.386 --> 01:45:09.388
O happy dagger!

01:45:10.555 --> 01:45:12.349
This is thy sheath.

01:45:16.603 --> 01:45:20.399
There rust, and let me die.

01:45:28.031 --> 01:45:31.118
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.

01:45:31.785 --> 01:45:34.746
The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head.

01:45:36.206 --> 01:45:40.127
Go hence,
to have more talk of these sad things.

01:45:41.420 --> 01:45:45.799
Some shall be pardoned,
and some punished.

01:45:46.883 --> 01:45:50.429
For never was a story of more woe

01:45:51.096 --> 01:45:55.934
than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

01:46:25.005 --> 01:46:26.423
Bravo!

01:47:36.368 --> 01:47:37.953
- God save the Queen!
- God save the Queen!

01:47:38.036 --> 01:47:40.372
I arrest you in the name of Queen Elizabeth!

01:47:40.956 --> 01:47:46.253
- Arrest who, Mr Tilney?
- Everyone!

01:47:47.170 --> 01:47:50.090
Admiral's Men, the Chamberlain's Men

01:47:50.215 --> 01:47:54.386
and every one of you ne'er-do-wells
that stand in contempt

01:47:54.469 --> 01:47:57.848
of the authority vested
in me by Her Majesty!

01:47:57.931 --> 01:48:01.977
Contempt? You closed the Rose.
I have not opened it.

01:48:02.394 --> 01:48:04.479
That woman is a woman!

01:48:05.772 --> 01:48:09.734
What? A woman? You mean that goat?

01:48:10.193 --> 01:48:15.615
I'll see you all in Clink, in the name
of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth!

01:48:15.699 --> 01:48:17.117
Mr Tilney!

01:48:24.916 --> 01:48:27.586
Have a care with my name.
You will wear it out.

01:48:36.011 --> 01:48:40.390
The queen of England does not attend
exhibitions of public lewdness.

01:48:41.099 --> 01:48:43.226
So something is out of joint.

01:48:45.854 --> 01:48:48.940
Come here, Master Kent.
Let me look at you.

01:49:04.122 --> 01:49:06.291
Yes, the illusion is remarkable.

01:49:07.209 --> 01:49:09.878
And your error, Mr Tilney,
is easily forgiven.

01:49:11.588 --> 01:49:14.257
But I know something
of a woman in a man's profession.

01:49:15.342 --> 01:49:17.886
Yes, by God, I do know about that.

01:49:20.138 --> 01:49:22.849
That is enough from you, Master Kent.

01:49:27.979 --> 01:49:31.107
- If only Lord Wessex were here.
- He is, ma'am.

01:49:36.905 --> 01:49:38.323
Your Majesty.

01:49:39.658 --> 01:49:41.701
There was a wager I remember

01:49:42.661 --> 01:49:46.331
as to whether a play could show
the very truth and nature of love.

01:49:47.791 --> 01:49:49.542
I think you lost it today.

01:49:55.090 --> 01:49:58.301
You are an eager boy.
Did you like the play?

01:49:58.969 --> 01:50:01.805
I liked it when she stabbed herself,
Your Majesty.

01:50:08.645 --> 01:50:10.438
Master Shakespeare.

01:50:13.650 --> 01:50:16.403
Next time you come to Greenwich,
come as yourself,

01:50:17.862 --> 01:50:19.698
and we will speak some more.

01:50:37.173 --> 01:50:38.675
Your Majesty.

01:50:41.553 --> 01:50:45.348
Why, Lord Wessex. Lost your wife so soon?

01:50:45.765 --> 01:50:47.892
Indeed I am a bride short,

01:50:48.351 --> 01:50:51.563
and my ship sails for the new world
on the evening tide.

01:50:53.773 --> 01:50:55.275
How is this to end?

01:50:55.859 --> 01:51:00.238
As stories must
when love's denied: with tears and a journey.

01:51:02.282 --> 01:51:06.077
Those whom God has joined in marriage
not even I can put asunder.

01:51:08.330 --> 01:51:09.706
Master Kent.

01:51:15.920 --> 01:51:19.382
Lord Wessex, as I foretold,
has lost his wife in the playhouse.

01:51:21.593 --> 01:51:24.387
Go make your farewell and send her out.

01:51:25.513 --> 01:51:27.098
It's time to settle accounts.

01:51:30.518 --> 01:51:32.937
- How much was that wager?
- Fifty shillings.

01:51:35.398 --> 01:51:36.608
Pounds.

01:51:37.942 --> 01:51:41.363
Give it to Master Kent.
He will see it rightfully home.

01:51:50.663 --> 01:51:54.042
Tell Master Shakespeare
something more cheerful next time

01:51:54.125 --> 01:51:55.919
for Twelfth Night.

01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:15.563
Too late. Too late.

01:52:26.324 --> 01:52:27.992
My Lady Wessex.

01:52:43.508 --> 01:52:45.593
A hired player no longer.

01:52:47.262 --> 01:52:51.015
£50, Will, for the poet of true love.

01:52:52.976 --> 01:52:54.811
I'm done with theatre.

01:52:56.729 --> 01:53:00.900
The playhouse is for dreamers.
Look what the dream brought us.

01:53:03.027 --> 01:53:05.113
It was we ourselves did that.

01:53:06.865 --> 01:53:10.702
And for my life to come,
I would not have it otherwise.

01:53:11.661 --> 01:53:14.372
I have hurt you, and I'm sorry for it.

01:53:15.957 --> 01:53:21.379
If my hurt is to be that you write no more,
then I shall be the sorrier.

01:53:27.635 --> 01:53:32.515
The Queen commands a comedy, Will,
for Twelfth Night.

01:53:32.599 --> 01:53:33.850
A comedy.

01:53:35.518 --> 01:53:37.479
What would my hero be?

01:53:37.562 --> 01:53:40.940
The saddest wretch in all the kingdom,
sick with love?

01:53:43.276 --> 01:53:44.986
It's a beginning.

01:53:46.821 --> 01:53:50.909
Let him be a duke, and your heroine...

01:53:50.992 --> 01:53:54.204
Sold in marriage and halfway to America.

01:53:55.914 --> 01:53:57.415
At sea, then.

01:53:58.750 --> 01:54:02.837
- A voyage to a new world.
- A storm. All are lost.

01:54:02.921 --> 01:54:08.968
She lands on a vast and empty shore.

01:54:11.387 --> 01:54:13.348
She's brought to the duke,

01:54:14.891 --> 01:54:17.602
- Orsino.
- Orsino?

01:54:19.604 --> 01:54:20.939
Good name.

01:54:21.022 --> 01:54:25.443
But fearful of her virtue,
she comes to him dressed as a boy.

01:54:26.861 --> 01:54:29.197
And thus is unable to declare her love.

01:54:31.491 --> 01:54:33.660
But all ends well.

01:54:34.410 --> 01:54:38.081
- How does it?
- I don't know.

01:54:39.874 --> 01:54:41.543
It's a mystery.

01:54:49.801 --> 01:54:54.639
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.

01:54:56.808 --> 01:54:58.351
Nor you for me.

01:55:00.812 --> 01:55:02.021
Goodbye, my love.

01:55:03.815 --> 01:55:05.942
A thousand times goodbye.

01:55:11.447 --> 01:55:12.574
Write me well.

01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:47.650
<i>My story starts at sea,</i>

01:55:48.985 --> 01:55:51.988
<i>a perilous voyage to an unknown land.</i>

01:55:53.656 --> 01:55:55.116
<i>A shipwreck.</i>

01:55:58.620 --> 01:56:02.040
<i>The wild waters roar and heave.</i>

01:56:03.541 --> 01:56:07.045
<i>The brave vessel is dashed all to pieces,</i>

01:56:09.756 --> 01:56:14.177
<i>and all the helpless souls
within her drowned.</i>

01:56:18.514 --> 01:56:20.016
<i>All save one,</i>

01:56:21.976 --> 01:56:23.311
<i>a lady</i>

01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:28.066
<i>whose soul is greater than the ocean</i>

01:56:29.942 --> 01:56:33.446
<i>and her spirit,
stronger than the sea's embrace.</i>

01:56:36.366 --> 01:56:38.451
<i>Not for her a watery end,</i>

01:56:41.204 --> 01:56:45.041
<i>but a new life beginning on a stranger shore.</i>

01:56:49.504 --> 01:56:51.589
<i>It will be a love story</i>

01:56:56.219 --> 01:56:59.389
<i>for she will be my heroine for all time.</i>

01:57:02.934 --> 01:57:06.437
<i>And her name will be Viola.</i>
