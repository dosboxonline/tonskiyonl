14:55.764 --> 14:58.114
<i>Labyrinths of the Mind.</i>

15:00.725 --> 15:02.597
Has anyone else ever
come looking for this?

15:02.597 --> 15:04.991
Our records show
you are the first.

15:06.427 --> 15:09.343
What can you tell me about
the person who left this here?

15:09.343 --> 15:11.867
Only the basics, I'm afraid.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.434
According to our records,

15:13.434 --> 15:15.175
Dr. Derex was
an accomplished neuroscientist,

15:15.175 --> 15:16.785
originally from Betazed.

15:16.785 --> 15:19.440
Became an Archivist herself
later in life.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.659
Lived out the remainder
of her days here.

15:23.618 --> 15:26.012
I'll leave you to it,
while I show Mr. Booker

15:26.012 --> 15:28.101
to his viewing room.

15:30.103 --> 15:32.409
Thank you.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.374
[door closes]

15:44.421 --> 15:47.120
[sighs softly]

16:16.888 --> 16:18.934
[whirring]

16:20.283 --> 16:22.546
[gasps]

16:29.075 --> 16:31.164
Is your name really "Book"?

16:31.164 --> 16:33.470
Uh, yeah.

16:33.470 --> 16:37.866
How fun to have a Book visit <i>me</i>
in the library for a change.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.130
Hmm.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.497
This box is Tuli wood.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.116
[Book sighs]

17:15.121 --> 17:17.949
We were hoping
you could tell us what it is.

17:20.996 --> 17:23.390
[sighs]
Mm-hmm.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.089
It's a...

17:29.222 --> 17:32.094
...a cutting
from the Kwejian world root.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.885
Wow.

17:40.885 --> 17:43.323
How?

17:43.323 --> 17:45.716
It was given to us long ago,

17:45.716 --> 17:49.111
but was recently moved
to a place of honor.

17:49.111 --> 17:51.244
It is part of our sacred duty

17:51.244 --> 17:53.942
to ensure that cultures that
are lost are never forgotten.

17:53.942 --> 17:56.031
[Book exhales shakily]

17:59.078 --> 18:01.080
Hmm.

18:02.472 --> 18:04.518
Wow.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.957
[voice breaking]:
Thank you.

18:10.959 --> 18:13.004
If you would like
to take that with you,

18:13.004 --> 18:14.876
we consider that your right,

18:14.876 --> 18:16.399
as one
of the last living Kwejian.

18:16.399 --> 18:17.922
[Book sighs]

18:17.922 --> 18:19.924
We would only ask
that you return someday

18:19.924 --> 18:23.406
and tell us what's become of it
so we may have a record.

18:25.321 --> 18:27.367
[laughs softly]

18:29.934 --> 18:32.850
BOOK:
Michael, you won't believe...

18:32.850 --> 18:35.244
Michael?

18:35.244 --> 18:37.159
Hey.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.205
Michael?

18:44.340 --> 18:46.386
[sighs]

19:03.751 --> 19:05.883
Hello?

19:09.670 --> 19:12.281
Burnham to <i>Discovery.</i>
Do you copy?

19:20.942 --> 19:22.465
Hello?

19:22.465 --> 19:25.033
Shh!

19:26.469 --> 19:28.558
I'm at a really good part.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.483
Book?

19:40.483 --> 19:42.964
[murmuring]

19:43.965 --> 19:45.923
This isn't real,

19:45.923 --> 19:48.012
is it?

19:49.013 --> 19:50.624
Nope.

19:52.582 --> 19:55.585
Your consciousness has been
transported into a mindscape.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.108
A virtual space created

19:57.108 --> 19:58.675
from what your neural activity
indicates

19:58.675 --> 20:02.157
as the most important place
in your life.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.333
I've never been here before.

20:04.333 --> 20:06.683
The mind doesn't lie.

20:06.683 --> 20:09.251
Who are you, exactly?

20:09.251 --> 20:12.036
I'm the program
Dr. Derex created.

20:12.036 --> 20:14.343
So why do you look like you?

20:14.343 --> 20:17.564
My form was generated
from your subconscious,

20:17.564 --> 20:20.219
so you tell me.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.791
So this is a test.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.967
Same as with every other clue
we found.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.013
So I've got
to figure something out, pass,

20:32.013 --> 20:33.971
get the clue and get out, yeah?

20:33.971 --> 20:35.843
Sounds like you know the drill.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.279
Then let's get on with it.

20:37.279 --> 20:38.628
I'm ready.

20:38.628 --> 20:39.890
Are you?

20:41.414 --> 20:43.459
[high-pitching whirring]

20:45.679 --> 20:48.508
She's stable,
at least physically.

20:48.508 --> 20:51.250
Doesn't seem
to be in any distress.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.382
- What happened to her?
- I don't know.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.818
I've worked here for decades.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.429
I've never seen anything
like this.

20:56.429 --> 20:59.388
It looks like some sort
of nucleonic emitter.

20:59.388 --> 21:01.085
It's connected
to her frontal lobe,

21:01.085 --> 21:04.350
and it appears to be running
a program in her mind.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.135
- Okay, can you stop it?
- Not safely.

21:07.135 --> 21:09.833
And transporting her back risks
severing the nucleonic beam.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.270
Disconnecting it
while the program

21:11.270 --> 21:12.967
is still running
could be fatal.

21:17.841 --> 21:20.627
I'm going in after her.

21:20.627 --> 21:23.586
This must be it, right?
The transmitter?

21:23.586 --> 21:25.371
Why isn't it working?

21:26.415 --> 21:28.939
It must not be capable
of multiple connections.

21:30.550 --> 21:34.336
But each clue so far has had
some kind of challenge involved.

21:34.336 --> 21:37.165
We have to assume that... that
that's what this program is.

21:37.165 --> 21:39.602
We can't just wait around
and hope she passes the test.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.517
If the clue's here,
we have to find it ourselves.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.519
Hy'Rell,
I need everything you've got

21:43.519 --> 21:44.825
on this neuroscientist.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.392
Any biographical data,

21:46.392 --> 21:47.915
any books she's accessed.

21:47.915 --> 21:49.482
I'll be back shortly.

21:50.483 --> 21:54.922
[door opens, closes]

21:57.098 --> 22:00.188
AVATAR BOOK: Okay,
the clue's in here somewhere.

22:00.188 --> 22:02.408
Find it, and you'll know
where it is in the real world.

22:02.408 --> 22:04.410
BURNHAM:
Find the clue?
That's the test?

22:04.410 --> 22:06.977
No, the clue is the objective.

22:06.977 --> 22:09.980
The test to find it, you'll have
to figure out on your own.

22:09.980 --> 22:11.765
I don't have time for games.

22:11.765 --> 22:13.549
The scientists who hid
the Progenitors' technology--

22:13.549 --> 22:15.159
including Dr. Derex--

22:15.159 --> 22:17.379
wanted it found and protected.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.425
That's what I'm here to do.

22:20.426 --> 22:21.818
Good.

22:21.818 --> 22:23.690
I hope you succeed.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.387
Let me know if I can help.

22:25.387 --> 22:27.128
Can you narrow down
where to look?

22:27.128 --> 22:28.956
I'm not allowed to give hints.

22:28.956 --> 22:30.131
What about "yes"
or "no" questions--

22:30.131 --> 22:31.262
can you answer those?

22:31.262 --> 22:33.613
Depending on the question. Yes.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.180
Oh, my brain
should've picked Tilly.

22:36.180 --> 22:39.053
[sighs]
Derex was a neuroscientist.

22:39.053 --> 22:41.272
So what kind of test
would she have created?

22:42.970 --> 22:45.015
There is too much here

22:45.015 --> 22:47.453
to search randomly.

22:47.453 --> 22:49.629
She wants us to succeed? Yes?

22:49.629 --> 22:53.154
- Yes.
- Then she would have
created a...

22:57.245 --> 22:59.813
A way to narrow the scope
of the search.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.815
I assume
this is here for a reason?

23:01.815 --> 23:03.947
Everything's here for a reason.

23:03.947 --> 23:07.777
So, the clue wouldn't be
in Fiction or Art.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.866
Neuroscience is too easy.

23:09.866 --> 23:11.912
But if it were hidden on a shelf

23:11.912 --> 23:13.696
or in something
that looked like a book.

23:15.916 --> 23:17.961
History.

23:19.136 --> 23:20.660
Is that it?

23:21.661 --> 23:23.663
The History section?

23:23.663 --> 23:26.492
What's your logic?

23:26.492 --> 23:29.625
They started the clue trail
during the Dominion War.

23:29.625 --> 23:32.585
Jinaal said they wanted it found
during a time of peace.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.587
He believed peace was possible.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.284
The only way
progress like that happens

23:36.284 --> 23:38.112
is by learning from the past.

23:38.112 --> 23:41.550
Those who learn history
aren't doomed to repeat it.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.596
So we'll go through all
the books on the Dominion War,

23:43.596 --> 23:46.294
go from there.
Where's the History section?

23:46.294 --> 23:48.905
Have you thought about
what might happen if you fail?

23:48.905 --> 23:51.473
- No.
- The mindscape shuts down,

23:51.473 --> 23:54.171
and your brain functions
will cease.

23:56.783 --> 23:58.872
Security precaution.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.221
Sorry.

24:00.221 --> 24:01.918
I shouldn't be surprised.

24:01.918 --> 24:04.094
Jinaal would've let
an itronok eat us.

24:04.094 --> 24:06.227
It is not too late to leave.

24:07.750 --> 24:09.839
I can release you now.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.451
Last chance.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.496
I'm gonna finish this mission,

24:14.496 --> 24:16.759
and you are going to help.

24:17.717 --> 24:20.154
Lead the way. Let's go.

24:26.421 --> 24:28.684
[high-pitched whirring]

24:35.909 --> 24:37.519
I found everything
you asked for.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.521
Biographical data and a list

24:39.521 --> 24:42.568
of all materials accessed
by Dr. Derex while in residence.

24:45.048 --> 24:47.398
It'd be faster
to list what she didn't access.

24:47.398 --> 24:49.966
There is another matter,
as well.

24:51.141 --> 24:54.405
A Breen ship has arrived
at our beacon.

24:54.405 --> 24:57.408
They are requesting access
to our Archive.

24:57.408 --> 24:59.498
You can't let them in, not now.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.848
We cannot be perceived
as taking sides,

25:01.848 --> 25:04.720
but I will handle this
appropriately.

25:07.331 --> 25:09.029
<i>Discovery,</i>

25:09.029 --> 25:11.597
Commander Rhys, Red Alert.

25:13.512 --> 25:16.515
The Breen are on their way.

25:16.515 --> 25:21.258
[speaking Breen]

25:25.915 --> 25:28.918
Hello. I'm Hy'Rell, one
of the sworn order who tend...

25:28.918 --> 25:32.139
We tracked a Starfleet
jump signature to this location.

25:32.139 --> 25:34.750
They seek an item
which belongs to me.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.579
As a matter of policy,
when it comes to conflicts

25:37.579 --> 25:39.973
between our visitors,
the Archive does not...

25:39.973 --> 25:42.628
I hope, for your sake, that it
remains in your possession.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.894
Sir, in light of the fact

25:47.894 --> 25:50.331
that we have several priceless

25:50.331 --> 25:52.420
Breen artifacts in our Archive,

25:52.420 --> 25:54.335
I'll do you the courtesy
to suggest

25:54.335 --> 25:56.337
that you rephrase your request.

25:56.337 --> 25:57.991
Give it to me!

25:57.991 --> 26:00.776
Or the Archive and its contents
will be made ash.

26:00.776 --> 26:04.519
[others speaking Breen]

26:08.175 --> 26:10.133
Your request is denied,

26:10.133 --> 26:13.397
and all Breen privileges are
suspended until further notice.

26:13.397 --> 26:15.791
May you gain knowledge
elsewhere.

26:29.152 --> 26:32.416
L'ak told me
the Breen had great reverence

26:32.416 --> 26:34.680
for their culture and history.

26:35.681 --> 26:37.421
Not you, though, hmm?

26:37.421 --> 26:40.250
You say
what is hidden down there

26:40.250 --> 26:43.950
will reveal the location of the
Progenitors' technology. How?

26:43.950 --> 26:48.824
You have to combine it with the
other clues that <i>Discovery</i> has.

26:48.824 --> 26:51.305
You made no mention
of other clues.

26:51.305 --> 26:53.568
<i>Discovery</i> is here
already somewhere.

26:53.568 --> 26:55.614
You can easily overpower them.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.833
Find what's in the Archive,
take what they've got.

26:57.833 --> 26:59.574
We'll have everything we need.

26:59.574 --> 27:02.446
- [grunts]
- [groans]

27:02.446 --> 27:04.623
Is there...

27:04.623 --> 27:07.016
- anything else?
- [groaning]

27:08.627 --> 27:11.064
Do not test my patience again.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.718
[Moll groans]

27:14.937 --> 27:17.984
[gasping]

27:25.513 --> 27:28.211
[Burnham sighs]

27:28.211 --> 27:29.735
Are the lights getting dimmer,
or are we...

27:29.735 --> 27:31.214
we've just been at this
too long?

27:31.214 --> 27:32.389
Hmm?

27:32.389 --> 27:34.435
Never mind.

27:37.481 --> 27:39.266
[sighs heavily]

27:39.266 --> 27:42.269
There's nothing in the "Dominion
War" section, or any other wars.

27:42.269 --> 27:43.836
Nothing in Betazed history,
Trill history,

27:43.836 --> 27:46.142
or the Mirror universe.

27:48.536 --> 27:50.277
I'm going the wrong way,
aren't I?

27:50.277 --> 27:51.626
Yes.

27:51.626 --> 27:53.672
Damn it.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.370
- Why didn't you tell me?!
- You didn't ask.

27:57.676 --> 27:59.721
I told you everything in here
was for a reason.

27:59.721 --> 28:02.115
You assumed
the reason was history.

28:02.115 --> 28:04.726
[groans]
Try being proactive next time.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.728
It's your mindscape.
I can help you,

28:06.728 --> 28:09.383
- but I can't solve it for you.
- Fine.

28:12.038 --> 28:15.041
Why is this library
the most important place to me?

28:15.041 --> 28:17.043
Why did my subconscious
pick this place

28:17.043 --> 28:19.132
for the test?

28:21.743 --> 28:24.224
It's the mission.

28:24.224 --> 28:26.748
Isn't it?

28:26.748 --> 28:29.142
It's because
the mission is here.

28:29.142 --> 28:31.927
And when I'm on a mission,
that's my priority.

28:31.927 --> 28:35.148
That's why
this place matters so much.

28:35.148 --> 28:37.890
Speaking proactively,
you may be onto something.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.500
Good.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.936
Great.

28:40.936 --> 28:42.372
So?

28:42.372 --> 28:44.723
So.

28:46.507 --> 28:48.204
BURNHAM:
<i>Labyrinths of the Mind.</i>

28:50.729 --> 28:52.905
This mission is
in a labyrinth of books.

28:52.905 --> 28:55.603
Labyrinth. Labyrinth.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.605
Oh, it's a maze.

28:57.605 --> 28:59.389
BOOK:
Mm.

28:59.389 --> 29:01.435
BURNHAM:
Finishing the mission means
getting out,

29:01.435 --> 29:05.395
and getting out is how
I find the clue.

29:05.395 --> 29:07.789
I am supposed
to find my way out,

29:07.789 --> 29:11.924
back to the reading room
where it all started, right?

29:11.924 --> 29:13.795
Unless you'd rather die in here.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.797
Hmm.

29:15.797 --> 29:18.539
Well, there are mathematical
methods for solving mazes.

29:20.497 --> 29:21.977
Ah.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.979
Trémaux's algorithm.

29:23.979 --> 29:25.676
I just need
to find a way to mark my path,

29:25.676 --> 29:27.287
to eliminate routes.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.335
Thank you.

29:32.335 --> 29:34.033
For what it's worth,

29:34.033 --> 29:35.991
I prefer this version of you
that is helpful.

29:35.991 --> 29:38.167
Tilly would've been
just as frustrating.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.082
For what it's worth.

29:40.082 --> 29:41.257
Hmm.

29:47.873 --> 29:49.483
Nothing in there leads
to the clue.

29:49.483 --> 29:51.137
How about her reading list?

29:51.137 --> 29:53.313

just loved learning new things.

[Klaxon alarm sounding]

30:06.369 --> 30:08.371
Excuse me.

30:08.371 --> 30:10.983
Unfortunately, our conversation
with the Breen did not go well.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.854
We have raised our shields,
which means

30:12.854 --> 30:14.421
transport back
to your ship will be impossible

30:14.421 --> 30:15.857
for the time being.

30:15.857 --> 30:18.207
My apologies.

30:18.207 --> 30:20.906
I must go prepare our defenses.

30:20.906 --> 30:22.733
I'll help you.

30:22.733 --> 30:24.213
Let me know if you need me.

30:24.213 --> 30:27.913
Damn it.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.523

take us out of the oasis,

30:52.633 --> 30:54.809
- back into the plasma storm.
- Sir?

30:54.809 --> 30:57.116
If it blinds our sensors,
it'll blind theirs, too.

30:57.116 --> 30:59.988
Lieutenant Naya, monitor weather
patterns in the plasma storm,

30:59.988 --> 31:03.383
send the data to Asha's station,
keep us as safe as you can.

31:03.383 --> 31:05.559
- Aye, Commander.
- Just stating the obvious here,

31:05.559 --> 31:07.691
but we can only withstand
that storm for so long.

31:07.691 --> 31:09.693
I know.

32:28.337 --> 32:31.210
Why are you making this
so hard?

32:33.386 --> 32:35.475
I'm doing
what the scientists wanted.

32:35.475 --> 32:36.998
I'm-I'm trying to...

32:36.998 --> 32:39.174
They didn't ask for you.

32:40.175 --> 32:41.437
What?!

32:42.482 --> 32:45.485
They wanted the technology
in the right hands, yes.

32:45.485 --> 32:48.836
They wanted it protected... yes.

32:48.836 --> 32:51.491
But who's to say
you're one of the good guys?

32:52.535 --> 32:55.060
How could they possibly know
that you, Michael Burnham,

32:55.060 --> 32:58.193
out of anyone alive,
could be trusted with it?

33:02.067 --> 33:03.590
There's a test here.

You haven't passed it yet.

33:17.821 --> 33:20.041

34:14.574 --> 34:16.924
BURNHAM:
What is the test?

34:19.709 --> 34:22.669
Is it why
this mission is so important?

34:23.713 --> 34:25.802
Every mission is important.

34:25.802 --> 34:28.327
[sighs]
So what is it?

[sighs]

34:32.548 --> 34:34.985
<i>Labyrinths of the Mind.</i>

Is it me?

34:41.296 --> 34:43.603
It's my mind.

34:43.603 --> 34:45.126
Right?

34:47.607 --> 34:49.435
That's why
my subconscious picked you.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.698
Because we talked earlier.

34:51.698 --> 34:53.700
And...

34:53.700 --> 34:55.267
And what?

34:55.267 --> 34:57.530
We didn't fix it.

34:59.749 --> 35:01.925
That's why I picked you.

35:01.925 --> 35:05.625
Because I want to fix it,
but I don't know how.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.109
He looked at me like that, too.

35:12.197 --> 35:13.850
Flat.

35:13.850 --> 35:16.288
'Cause he thinks the job is
all that matters to me.

35:17.289 --> 35:19.639
And so, is that what you want?

35:19.639 --> 35:22.468
Do you want me to admit that?

35:22.468 --> 35:25.819
That the job is everything?
Is that how I get the clue?

35:25.819 --> 35:29.431
Or maybe, I should go
even more psychobabble here

35:29.431 --> 35:31.433
and admit that if I don't
complete this mission,

35:31.433 --> 35:33.609
then I don't know who I am.

35:36.786 --> 35:38.875
Maybe I think that, uh...

35:40.355 --> 35:42.531
...nobody will love me, or...

35:42.531 --> 35:45.012
or care about me
if I'm a failure.

35:49.059 --> 35:51.453
And maybe that's the reason
why I lost you.

35:52.715 --> 35:54.369
Him.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.545
Is that right?

35:58.547 --> 35:59.940
Some of those things
may be true,

35:59.940 --> 36:01.855
but they are not the answer.

36:03.857 --> 36:06.860
[whooshing]

36:13.997 --> 36:15.608
Wait. So,

36:15.608 --> 36:18.088
I succeed, I fix things.

36:18.088 --> 36:19.873
What's wrong with that?

36:19.873 --> 36:22.136
What's wrong
with-with having a purpose?

36:22.136 --> 36:25.139
You don't have to go out
every day and prove yourself,

36:25.139 --> 36:27.359
why you matter.

36:28.490 --> 36:32.755
You don't have to prove
that you deserve this uniform,

36:32.755 --> 36:35.584
this rank, that...

36:35.584 --> 36:37.847
that you can be counted on,
that you won't quit,

36:37.847 --> 36:39.501
that you won't fail again.

36:39.501 --> 36:40.807
Again?

36:44.854 --> 36:46.987
Screw you.

36:46.987 --> 36:49.076

36:53.646 --> 36:55.604
<i>RHYS:

36:55.604 --> 36:57.519
how much longer
till we can help the Archive?

36:57.519 --> 36:59.391
<i>We are working on it, Commander.</i>

36:59.391 --> 37:01.915
So how the hell do we disrupt
a shield-tunneling technology

37:01.915 --> 37:03.438
we've never encountered before

37:03.438 --> 37:06.136
from a species
we know almost nothing about?

37:06.136 --> 37:07.442
And don't forget
we have to do it

37:07.442 --> 37:09.096
without the Breen knowing
we're here.

37:09.096 --> 37:10.880
How hard could that be?

37:10.880 --> 37:12.273
ADIRA:
Hey, look at this.
Their tunnel has

37:12.273 --> 37:13.970
a periodic fluctuation.

37:13.970 --> 37:16.495
It's, uh, 8.4 times per second.

37:16.495 --> 37:19.454
Yeah. They're-they're using
harmonic resonance...

37:19.454 --> 37:22.152
BOTH:
To match the Archive's
shield frequency.

37:22.152 --> 37:23.676
I love when you two do that.

37:23.676 --> 37:25.373
STAMETS:
It's an automated process, but

37:25.373 --> 37:27.549
if we could make
the Breen's system think

37:27.549 --> 37:29.247
that the frequency's changed,

37:29.247 --> 37:31.597
it would remodulate,
closing the tunnel

37:31.597 --> 37:33.338
so none of the soldiers
could get inside.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.470
The problem is, the Breen use
base-duodeca coding,

37:35.470 --> 37:37.429
which is, like,
really hard to hack.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.692
Remember when I was talking
about all the odd jobs

37:39.692 --> 37:41.302
that I used to have?

37:41.302 --> 37:43.522
- Uh, yes?
- [Stamets gasps]

37:43.522 --> 37:45.872
There was a stint where I fixed

37:45.872 --> 37:48.440
comms relays near Hysperia.

37:48.440 --> 37:52.574
Hysperians really know
how to party, by the way,

37:52.574 --> 37:54.184
but it's another story.

37:54.184 --> 37:57.275
Point is,
we'd do remote repairs using

37:57.275 --> 37:59.625
concentrated positron beams,

37:59.625 --> 38:02.976
which can be set to pulse
at pretty much any frequency.

38:02.976 --> 38:04.586
We-we could direct

38:04.586 --> 38:07.241
a positron beam
right to where the tunnel meets

38:07.241 --> 38:09.069
the Archive's shields,
and then, if we set the beam

38:09.069 --> 38:11.332
to a different frequency...

38:11.332 --> 38:13.552
That's it. Do it again.

38:13.552 --> 38:15.684
BOTH:
The tunnel would
automatically close!

38:15.684 --> 38:17.033
ADIRA:
Yeah, but eventually,
they're gonna

38:17.033 --> 38:19.079
realize the error
and-and correct it.

38:19.079 --> 38:22.212
Yes, but, hopefully, by then,
our team's already out.

38:22.212 --> 38:25.041
- Great idea.
- I live to serve.

38:25.041 --> 38:27.305
Commander, we have a solution,

but it'll take a few minutes.

They'll come
into this intersection here,

38:35.878 --> 38:38.098
they'll fan out and look for us,
I'm guessing in groups of four.

38:38.098 --> 38:40.448
Okay, I see a few places
where we can hit them from,

38:40.448 --> 38:42.624

on their arrival position.

38:43.669 --> 38:45.714
No. There.

The spore drive malfunctioned.</i>

52:44.204 --> 52:46.728
The sensors say it was damaged
by the Breen assault.

52:46.728 --> 52:49.166
We cannot jump again
until it is fixed.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.603
Warp drive is also damaged,
Captain.

52:51.603 --> 52:52.647
Looking into how bad.

52:52.647 --> 52:54.214
Keep me posted.

52:54.214 --> 52:55.607
Any casualties?

52:55.607 --> 52:57.261
A few minor injuries, that's it.

52:57.261 --> 52:58.697
Good.

52:58.697 --> 53:00.220
Lieutenant Tilly,
considering maximum warp,

53:00.220 --> 53:01.482
how long will it take
the Breen ship

53:01.482 --> 53:02.918
to get to the map coordinates?

53:02.918 --> 53:05.356
Six hours, give or take.

53:05.356 --> 53:08.054
Commander Rayner, I want all
available personnel on repairs.

53:08.054 --> 53:10.317
They have five hours,
and then we need to go.

53:10.317 --> 53:11.449
You got it.

53:11.449 --> 53:13.277
Smart move, by the way, Captain.

53:13.277 --> 53:16.236
Now Ruhn thinks we're dead.
Advantage us.

53:16.236 --> 53:18.847
Someone once told me
never turn my back on a Breen.

53:19.892 --> 53:21.676
They still might beat us
to the coordinates.

53:21.676 --> 53:24.723
No, I learned something
in the mindscape.

53:24.723 --> 53:26.768
Something we'll need to know
when we get there.

53:26.768 --> 53:28.596
And I can't imagine
Ruhn figuring it out.

53:28.596 --> 53:30.511
What about Moll?

53:36.082 --> 53:38.519
Primarch, we have confirmed

53:38.519 --> 53:41.174
debris
and traces of warp plasma.

53:41.174 --> 53:43.611
<i>Discovery</i> has been destroyed.

53:45.657 --> 53:47.224
Good.

53:49.356 --> 53:51.315
Prepare to fire on the Archive.

53:55.319 --> 53:57.277
You swore a tergun.

53:58.800 --> 54:01.194
Don't make this
any worse for your crew

54:01.194 --> 54:02.891
than you already have.

54:04.371 --> 54:06.721
Set a course
for the map coordinates.

54:06.721 --> 54:08.767
The goal is L'ak.

54:08.767 --> 54:11.378
The goal is whatever
I say it is.

54:11.378 --> 54:12.945
Recharge the weapons.

54:12.945 --> 54:15.426
Take her to The Chamber.

54:15.426 --> 54:18.429
But, Primarch, she...

54:20.257 --> 54:21.910
Take her!

54:23.347 --> 54:24.826
Yes, Primarch.

54:29.353 --> 54:30.745
No, damn it, wait!

54:30.745 --> 54:32.225
If you destroy the Archive,

54:32.225 --> 54:34.227
it won't just be
the Federation coming after you.

54:34.227 --> 54:36.403
It'll be other Breen, too.

54:36.403 --> 54:38.797
As revenge for your dishonor.

54:38.797 --> 54:40.668
With the Progenitors' power,

54:40.668 --> 54:42.279
we will not worry.

54:42.279 --> 54:43.976
But you don't have it yet.

54:43.976 --> 54:45.194
Do you?

54:49.764 --> 54:52.419
L'ak will never support
your succession

54:52.419 --> 54:55.161
if you kill me.

54:55.161 --> 54:57.729
I don't need L'ak anymore.

54:57.729 --> 54:59.818
Or you.

55:01.950 --> 55:03.343
And there it is.

55:03.343 --> 55:06.172
You don't give a damn
about your Scion,

55:06.172 --> 55:07.565
your oaths,

55:07.565 --> 55:09.915
or the lives of your soldiers.

55:09.915 --> 55:11.917
Would L'ak do this?

55:11.917 --> 55:15.137
Would your Scion be
this selfish?

55:15.137 --> 55:17.096
He left.

55:17.096 --> 55:19.011
For a human.

55:19.011 --> 55:21.274
He loves me.

55:21.274 --> 55:22.884
Yes.

55:22.884 --> 55:24.756
But he left because of you.

55:27.019 --> 55:28.890
Primarch, don't.

55:28.890 --> 55:30.327
How dare you!

55:31.153 --> 55:32.590
[grunting]

55:35.288 --> 55:37.769
[Breen clamoring]

55:49.824 --> 55:52.261
I am the wife of L'ak.

55:52.261 --> 55:54.394
Scion

55:54.394 --> 55:56.657
and true ruler of the Imperium.

56:02.489 --> 56:04.535
We will get him back.

56:06.711 --> 56:09.278
Long will he reign.

56:18.679 --> 56:20.507
Long will he reign.

56:23.641 --> 56:25.860
Long will he reign.

56:25.860 --> 56:27.949
Long will
he reign.

56:29.081 --> 56:30.996
Long will he reign.
