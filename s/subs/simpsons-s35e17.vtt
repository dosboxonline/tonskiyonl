WEBVTT

00:07.715 --> 00:10.655
<i>Hustle your bustle,
kids, we got to go!</i>

00:12.926 --> 00:14.796
Our day is packed
with doctor visits.

00:14.896 --> 00:18.938
So wrap up your angry food
shoveling and get in the car.

00:18.938 --> 00:22.311
Oh, this is gonna be a long day.

00:23.246 --> 00:25.483
- Oh, I hope so.
- Huh?

00:25.483 --> 00:27.656
Don't you get it?
This is a setup.

00:27.756 --> 00:30.695
Mom and Dad told us we're gonna
have the worst day ever,

00:30.795 --> 00:35.739
which means we're really
going to have the best day ever.

00:35.839 --> 00:37.876
- Wha...?
- You and I are about to be

00:37.976 --> 00:39.546
the stars of a "Mom-and-Dad

00:39.647 --> 00:43.386
in-car bait-and-switch" video.
- Guh?

00:43.386 --> 00:46.827
Put down your books
and read a phone sometime.

00:47.663 --> 00:50.033
You ready to go get
your new braces?

00:50.133 --> 00:51.302
Guess so.

00:51.403 --> 00:53.140
Well, we're not doing that.

00:53.240 --> 00:55.244
We're taking you to Krustyland!

00:55.344 --> 00:56.313
Yay!

00:56.413 --> 00:58.885
We're not sprinkling
Grandma's ashes today.

00:58.985 --> 01:00.888
We're going to Krustyland!

01:00.888 --> 01:02.793
Yay!

01:02.893 --> 01:04.663
We're not going to Krustyland.

01:04.763 --> 01:06.633
We're going to church.

01:06.633 --> 01:08.236
Yay!

01:10.106 --> 01:11.877
So Mom and Dad are punking us,

01:11.977 --> 01:14.148
and this is really gonna be
a fun thing?

01:14.148 --> 01:17.589
Exactly,
we are getting funk'd.

01:18.724 --> 01:20.494
Krustyland.

01:21.296 --> 01:24.335
We're almost at
"the medical center."

01:24.435 --> 01:28.477
I hope I'm tall enough
to ride the EKG machine.

01:30.047 --> 01:31.917
We're here.

01:36.058 --> 01:36.960
Wha...?

01:37.060 --> 01:39.198
This <i>is</i> a doctor's office.

01:39.198 --> 01:40.835
There was no bait and switch.

01:40.935 --> 01:42.070
It was all bait!

01:42.170 --> 01:44.042
No, no. This is Krustyland.

01:44.142 --> 01:45.211
It has to be.

01:45.311 --> 01:47.114
I'm going on the roller coaster.

01:48.383 --> 01:49.686
Whee!

01:49.786 --> 01:52.424
Whee... ze.

01:52.424 --> 01:55.063
Which doctor
are you here to see?

01:55.164 --> 01:56.901
- All of them.
- Like most Americans,

01:57.001 --> 02:00.975
our insurance is terrible
and has a giant deductible.

02:01.075 --> 02:02.846
Which we just met yesterday.

02:02.946 --> 02:04.816
Thank you, kidney stones.

02:06.052 --> 02:08.356
And our new insurance year
starts tomorrow.

02:08.456 --> 02:10.895
So today is the only day
that everything's free.

02:10.995 --> 02:14.669
So we're doing a whole year
of medical stuff in one day.

02:14.769 --> 02:17.240
Look, I went to
the Krustyland snack bar!

02:17.341 --> 02:19.580
I got 20cc's of
super silly saline.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.118

We've got to get one nice thing
out of this day.

02:59.225 --> 03:01.764
At least take us out for treats.

03:01.864 --> 03:02.966
Treats it is.

03:03.066 --> 03:05.705
We'll even get one for Maggie
for getting her eye test.

03:11.650 --> 03:16.025
One Mandalorian Mango Jango

03:16.125 --> 03:17.929
That's $6.99.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.770
Enter your tip and sign here.

03:25.243 --> 03:27.749
Oh, fine.

03:33.159 --> 03:34.529
You want a tip?

03:34.529 --> 03:36.332
It's self-serve.
We did all the work.

03:36.432 --> 03:39.404
Hey, that iPad
didn't swivel itself.

03:55.872 --> 03:57.475
Dad, are you all right?

03:57.576 --> 04:00.748
Oh, I just suffered death
by a thousand swipes,

04:00.848 --> 04:03.554
but at least now
it's time for my treat.

04:06.594 --> 04:08.496
Here's your Literary
Sampler Platter.

04:08.597 --> 04:11.102
Chicken Tenders is the Night,
A Farewell to Parms,

04:11.202 --> 04:13.239
Occurrence at Owl Creek Ribs.

04:13.339 --> 04:17.949
Mmm... fried references.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.520
My shift's ending,

04:19.620 --> 04:20.955
so I'll just leave this
with you.

04:22.090 --> 04:24.896
Better get my "figuring out
the tip" glasses.

04:24.996 --> 04:28.103
Wouldn't be a meal if
it didn't end with a math test.

04:28.705 --> 04:31.209
The service fee
is already included?

04:31.309 --> 04:32.812
I'm outraged!

04:32.913 --> 04:33.814
But also relieved.

04:33.814 --> 04:35.618
At least nobody's
leaning over my shoulder

04:35.718 --> 04:37.220
to shame me into leaving a tip.

04:37.321 --> 04:39.358
Actually, there is room
at the bottom

04:39.458 --> 04:41.228
for an additional gratuity.

04:41.329 --> 04:43.499
Right next to
where I pre-thanked you.

04:45.303 --> 04:47.608
What? They include the tip,

04:47.708 --> 04:50.079
and then I have to tip
on top of the tip?

04:50.079 --> 04:51.483
A tip top tip?

04:51.483 --> 04:53.988
Mm. I'll show them.

04:54.088 --> 04:56.694
I know that click.

04:56.794 --> 04:59.465
"No. Thank <i>you.</i>

04:59.465 --> 05:03.306
Here's one dollar. Okay?"

05:03.306 --> 05:04.809
We're leaving!

05:09.385 --> 05:11.890
Mr. Simpson!
Mr. Simpson, wait!

05:11.890 --> 05:14.028
Oh, great.
Here's the part where she says,

05:14.028 --> 05:16.132
"Was there something wrong
with the service?"

05:16.232 --> 05:17.535
And I throw potato skins at her.

05:17.635 --> 05:21.744
Oh, thank you so much,
you wonderful man!

05:23.947 --> 05:27.020
You tipped her $10,000?

05:27.120 --> 05:31.429
No! I tipped her one. "O.K."

05:31.530 --> 05:33.935
Ten K! Ah!

05:34.035 --> 05:36.606
I've never had this much money
in my life!

05:36.706 --> 05:37.809
Us neither.

05:37.909 --> 05:41.650
Yo, this guy just
tipped Sandee $10,000.

05:41.751 --> 05:43.620
You don't know
what this means to me.

05:45.490 --> 05:47.261
We don't have $10,000.

05:47.361 --> 05:49.265
We don't have 10,000
of anything.

05:49.265 --> 05:51.135
Homer, you have to fix this.

05:51.135 --> 05:53.306
Okay, you're right.
I got this.

05:53.407 --> 05:55.778
Excuse me,
can I get that check back?

05:55.878 --> 05:57.047
Why?

05:58.049 --> 05:59.686
Why?!

05:59.786 --> 06:01.289
What a jerk!

06:01.389 --> 06:05.164
Yo, this guy just stole
$10,000 from Sandee.

06:05.264 --> 06:06.398
Get him.

06:07.802 --> 06:10.140
There was already a gratuity
on the bill.

06:12.545 --> 06:15.784
Why? Why did you
want the check back?

06:17.020 --> 06:20.661
So I can underline the $10,000.

06:23.066 --> 06:26.606
Yo, this guy just underlined
the $10,000-tip

06:26.706 --> 06:28.877
he gave Sandee, get him!

06:37.494 --> 06:39.498
Your accidental tip went viral.

06:39.599 --> 06:41.102
The American dream.

06:41.102 --> 06:44.441
Now we'll be in debt
for the rest of our lives!

06:44.542 --> 06:46.713
The American reality.

06:46.713 --> 06:49.185
Look, baby,
no one's madder at me than me,

06:49.285 --> 06:50.755
but me have a plan.

06:50.855 --> 06:53.894
We call the credit card company,
report the card stolen,

06:53.995 --> 06:56.231
and then shave our heads
and join a cult.

06:56.332 --> 06:57.602
One of the ones
where you don't have to

06:57.602 --> 06:59.038
have sex with the leader.

06:59.038 --> 07:00.708
There is no such cult!

07:00.708 --> 07:02.478
You need to go
back to that restaurant

07:02.579 --> 07:05.383
and explain that
this was all a mistake.

07:05.483 --> 07:06.520
I will.

07:06.620 --> 07:08.155
I was gonna go back there anyway

07:08.256 --> 07:12.230
for the bottomless chili fries,
but now I have two reasons.

07:13.499 --> 07:17.575
Okay, time to hit undo
on last night's ten-K typo.

07:18.376 --> 07:20.480
Hey, that's the big tip guy.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.484
Ooh! Can I get an autograph?

07:22.484 --> 07:25.257
Oh, signing things is
what got me into this mess.

07:25.357 --> 07:27.260
Hey! You're the guy
on the cover

07:27.360 --> 07:28.997
of the only newspaper
left in the world.

07:28.997 --> 07:32.071
I'm in the paper
for something I remember doing.

07:32.171 --> 07:34.542
- Let me get a copy.
- That'll be one dollar.

07:34.643 --> 07:37.114
How much do you think
he's gonna tip?

07:37.214 --> 07:39.151
A lot or a whole lot?

07:39.251 --> 07:41.221
Yarr. I'm putting on me slicker,

07:41.221 --> 07:43.994
'cause he's gonna
splash the cash.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.134
Keep the change, pal.

07:48.369 --> 07:50.941
The most generous man in town.

07:51.041 --> 07:53.681
Until today,
I always felt invisible,

07:53.781 --> 07:55.050
like Wonder Woman's plane

07:55.050 --> 07:57.521
or the guy selling flowers
on the off-ramp.

07:57.521 --> 07:59.660
But for the first time,
I am seen.

07:59.660 --> 08:02.297
It's not that I wasn't enough,
my tips weren't.

08:02.297 --> 08:07.374
Mr. Monopoly was wrong.
You <i>can</i> put a price on money.

08:07.374 --> 08:10.414
From now on,
I'm gonna tip like Ben Affleck

08:10.515 --> 08:12.985
and J.Lo's out of town, baby.

09:06.426 --> 09:08.864
Marge, I just had
the best day of my life.

09:08.864 --> 09:13.039
They gave my burrito
the most rice of anybody.

09:13.139 --> 09:17.681
So that's why I've been
bombarded by overdraft alerts.

09:19.619 --> 09:21.757
Don't worry, honey,
I can make it all right.

09:21.857 --> 09:25.030
Let me show you how to turn off
those notifications.

09:25.030 --> 09:28.871
Homer, we need to have
a serious talk.

09:28.971 --> 09:32.210
Oh, boy, then I'm gonna need
some Mexican courage.

09:37.253 --> 09:39.726
You were supposed to
get our money back,

09:39.726 --> 09:41.395
not give away more.

09:41.496 --> 09:44.368
Your tipping has gotten
out of control.

09:44.468 --> 09:46.539
But it feels so good
to be appreciated.

09:46.639 --> 09:47.808
For once,
people aren't judging me

09:47.908 --> 09:52.083
by the content of my character
but by the content of my wallet.

09:52.183 --> 09:54.922
You wiped out our savings
and put us in debt.

09:55.023 --> 09:57.294
And look what it's doing
to our children.

09:57.394 --> 09:59.031
Dad, where's my bike?

09:59.031 --> 10:01.402
How would I know? I don't know.
You probably lost it.

10:01.503 --> 10:03.139
Dad...

10:03.239 --> 10:04.642
I tipped it!

10:04.742 --> 10:05.778
I gave it to my barber

10:05.878 --> 10:07.916
because he cleaned up
my eyebrows.

10:08.016 --> 10:10.654
I'm so sorry, Bart!

10:10.654 --> 10:12.858
I'm so sorry.

10:14.796 --> 10:16.298
Oh, there, there.

10:16.398 --> 10:17.802
Dad, you have a problem,

10:17.902 --> 10:21.141
but I love you
and I'll always be here for you.

10:21.242 --> 10:22.679
You're a good son.

10:22.679 --> 10:24.315
Here, for your troubles.

10:24.415 --> 10:25.985
- Hey!
- Let this slide

10:26.085 --> 10:28.289
and there's
a vacuum cleaner in it for you.

10:28.389 --> 10:30.561
Homer, this has to stop now!

10:30.561 --> 10:33.701
- Stop it!
- Marge, for once you're right.

10:33.801 --> 10:35.236
I have a serious problem.

10:35.336 --> 10:37.542
But, like any addiction,
it can easily be stopped

10:37.642 --> 10:39.946
by just deciding to stop.

10:40.046 --> 10:42.818
I'm going cold turkey.
I swear to you.

10:42.918 --> 10:44.454
I'll never again waste money

10:44.555 --> 10:47.327
trying to fill
an unfillable void.

10:49.932 --> 10:52.470
Exact change? Huh. That's it?

10:52.571 --> 10:54.609
Oh, I really want
to tip you, Moe,

10:54.709 --> 10:56.846
but I promised my wife I'd quit.

10:56.946 --> 10:58.215
Here's a thought, Homer.

10:58.215 --> 11:00.086
Uh, what if you took the moolah
out of your pocket,

11:00.086 --> 11:02.490
but you just stop
before anything happened.

11:02.592 --> 11:05.030
You know, uh,
everything but the tip.

11:05.130 --> 11:07.868
That doesn't seem like
it could lead to anything.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.072
Sure it couldn't.

11:16.318 --> 11:18.255
We shouldn't have done that.

11:18.255 --> 11:20.928
Does that mean that
you want to stop?

11:21.028 --> 11:22.464
No.

11:24.435 --> 11:26.238
It feels so good.

11:27.040 --> 11:29.110
Don't stop, you generous man.

11:29.512 --> 11:30.748
Oh, yeah,
give it to me, big boy.

11:30.748 --> 11:32.017
- You like that?
- Oh, that's the spot.

11:32.017 --> 11:33.887
- I can do this all night.
- Right there.

11:33.887 --> 11:35.156
- Tell me you want it.
- Oh, God!

11:35.156 --> 11:36.793
- Yes! Yes!
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

11:36.893 --> 11:39.865
- Oh, God! Oh, God.
- Yes!

11:40.768 --> 11:42.470
I need a new bar.

11:43.507 --> 11:44.842
Where you going?

11:44.842 --> 11:46.446
I can't stop tipping, Moe.

11:46.446 --> 11:47.849
I'm hooked on the rush.

11:47.849 --> 11:50.320
I got a monkey on my back,
and he's got his hand out.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.790
But what about us?

11:51.890 --> 11:54.996
No one service worker
can satisfy my needs.

11:54.996 --> 11:58.402
God help me,
I'm a tip-phomaniac.

12:50.774 --> 12:53.379
I'm a curse on my family.

12:53.379 --> 12:55.316
They're 20%--

12:55.416 --> 12:56.853
no, 22%--

12:56.953 --> 12:59.290
better off without me.

13:00.060 --> 13:04.034
I'll take my misery to go.

13:09.846 --> 13:11.583
Hey, it's Mr. Generous.

13:11.683 --> 13:13.352
What are you doing here?

13:13.452 --> 13:15.023
I've hit rock bottom

13:15.123 --> 13:17.293
and I need to be with family.

13:17.393 --> 13:20.032
Well, who were those people
you were eating with?

13:20.132 --> 13:21.870
Just my wife and some kids.

13:21.870 --> 13:25.578
My real family are
the people I tip, like you.

13:25.678 --> 13:27.582
You love me, right?

13:27.682 --> 13:30.320
Oh, you poor generous man.

13:30.420 --> 13:31.890
I do love you.

13:31.990 --> 13:34.494
You'll always be welcome here.

13:37.502 --> 13:39.873
You love me, right?

13:39.873 --> 13:42.611
Creep!

13:44.314 --> 13:45.483
Leave me alone!

13:46.485 --> 13:48.590
So our transaction was just...

13:48.590 --> 13:50.861
transactional?

14:01.984 --> 14:03.920
Am I alive? Is this a dream?

14:04.021 --> 14:05.524
Somebody pinch me.

14:05.624 --> 14:07.060
Ow!

14:07.160 --> 14:09.397
I'm awake, you can stop now.

14:13.038 --> 14:15.209
You saved my life.

14:15.309 --> 14:16.946
Here's a little something
for your troubles.

14:17.046 --> 14:18.516
Why you give me this money?

14:18.616 --> 14:20.420
Fausto no work for crab man.

14:20.521 --> 14:21.690
No, it's a tip.

14:21.790 --> 14:23.092
It's all I know.

14:23.192 --> 14:25.230
And it's destroyed
my marriage and my life.

14:25.330 --> 14:29.338
How I wish I had never heard
of thanking people.

14:29.338 --> 14:30.741
Well, your bloated body

14:30.741 --> 14:32.511
drifted to the right
neighborhood, my friend.

14:32.511 --> 14:33.913
Nobody tips here.

14:33.913 --> 14:35.416
It's forbidden.

14:35.517 --> 14:36.552
No tipping?

14:36.652 --> 14:38.524
What is this amazing place?

14:38.524 --> 14:40.560
Welcome to Little Europe.

14:43.834 --> 14:45.436
I'm home.

14:45.537 --> 14:47.373
Yi yo yu.

14:47.473 --> 14:50.780
There's no sign
of Homer anywhere.

14:50.780 --> 14:53.118
Okay, the first 24 hours
are crucial.

14:53.218 --> 14:55.557
Do you have a recent photo?

14:56.959 --> 14:58.863
Not him. You.

14:58.963 --> 15:00.934
For your dating profile.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.705
This is good.

15:02.805 --> 15:03.974
You look desperate.

15:04.074 --> 15:05.443
Guys love that.

15:05.544 --> 15:06.680
I don't want to date.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.448
I want to find my husband.

15:08.550 --> 15:10.453
"Marriage minded."

15:10.554 --> 15:11.823
Don't mention the kids.

15:11.923 --> 15:14.094
Bring them up on date three.

15:14.194 --> 15:16.533
Just before the sex.

15:16.533 --> 15:17.868
Oh, my God.

15:17.968 --> 15:19.872
We only have two
and a half dates to find Dad.

15:19.972 --> 15:21.576
At least we know he's alive.

15:21.676 --> 15:23.479
He's ordering things on Amazon.

15:23.580 --> 15:25.450
A universal power adapter.

15:25.551 --> 15:26.886
Bicycle pants clips.

15:26.986 --> 15:28.757
12-pack of fanny packs?

15:28.857 --> 15:31.596
Case of cologne, but no soap.

15:31.596 --> 15:34.367
I know exactly where he is.

15:37.575 --> 15:38.610
Dad?

15:38.710 --> 15:39.979
<i>Hola, mes petite--</i>

15:40.079 --> 15:41.248
how you say?-- children.

15:41.349 --> 15:44.288
Give your <i>papi</i>
a European handshake.

15:46.859 --> 15:48.897
What are you doing
in Little Europe?

15:48.997 --> 15:50.534
I'm going
to five different shops

15:50.634 --> 15:53.640
to get the ingredients
to make one sandwich.

15:55.309 --> 15:58.616
One smear of
your brownest mustard, Jorge.

16:04.596 --> 16:07.668
That'll be three deutsche-lira
and 99 pence.

16:07.768 --> 16:09.505
And not a franc more.

16:09.605 --> 16:11.008
Mom's a total mess.

16:11.108 --> 16:12.511
You've got to come home.

16:12.611 --> 16:13.914
This is my home now.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.449
I can live a happy life here,

16:15.550 --> 16:17.889
free from the demon
of generosity.

16:17.989 --> 16:19.457
So this is all about tipping?

16:19.558 --> 16:22.397
No, it's about
the European mindset

16:22.497 --> 16:24.000
of not tipping.

16:52.490 --> 16:54.294

17:47.166 --> 17:49.738
Dad, this place is amazing.

17:49.838 --> 17:51.509
I know.

17:51.609 --> 17:54.014
If only Springfield
was like this,

17:54.114 --> 17:55.551
then I could go back to your mom

17:55.651 --> 17:58.856
without my addiction
destroying the family.

18:00.860 --> 18:03.165
Dad, if you came back with us,

18:03.265 --> 18:04.668
you could change things.

18:04.768 --> 18:08.442
You could inspire everyone
to make Springfield like here.

18:08.543 --> 18:11.314
You really think Americans
can learn something

18:11.414 --> 18:13.185
from the country of Europe?

18:13.285 --> 18:15.924
Not just learn it, but steal it
and call it our own.

18:16.024 --> 18:18.062
Like pizza or fascism.

18:18.162 --> 18:20.332
I'll do it to heal our family.

18:20.432 --> 18:22.270
Let's grab an early dinner
at 10:00 p.m.,

18:22.270 --> 18:24.041
then ride the mini-Chunnel
back to Springfield.

18:24.141 --> 18:26.312
I'm going to take my message
to the people

18:26.412 --> 18:28.583
who tipping affects the most.

18:29.518 --> 18:32.290
<i>Live from the Servers
Of America Guild Theater.</i>

18:32.390 --> 18:35.496
<i>It's the 75th Annual SAG Awards.</i>

18:37.734 --> 18:41.308
Hello, my name is Gary, and I'll
be your presenter this evening.

18:41.308 --> 18:42.678
Friends,

18:42.778 --> 18:44.213
waiters, pepper-grinders,

18:44.314 --> 18:45.951
lend me your ears.

18:46.051 --> 18:47.788
My name is Homer Simpson

18:47.888 --> 18:49.959
and I am addicted to tipping.

18:50.059 --> 18:51.629
It was a compulsion so powerful

18:51.729 --> 18:54.535
that I ran away
from the woman I love.

18:55.770 --> 18:58.442
Well, I'm here to tell you
there's a better way.

18:58.543 --> 19:02.284
What if all restaurant workers
were paid a living wage?

19:02.284 --> 19:04.488
That way you wouldn't have
to rely on tips,

19:04.589 --> 19:08.028
and diners would know
how much everything costs.

19:08.028 --> 19:10.701
Get rid of tips
and live a better life.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.169
Who's with me?

19:13.574 --> 19:16.245
My fellow wait-staff,
this man is right.

19:16.345 --> 19:19.852
We can, we shall, we must,

19:19.952 --> 19:21.923
serve justice

19:21.923 --> 19:24.260
with a side of equanimity.

19:24.361 --> 19:26.231
No substitutions.

19:35.249 --> 19:38.122
Get rid of tips
and live a better life.

19:38.222 --> 19:39.825
Who's with me?

19:42.096 --> 19:43.399
Get rid of tips?

19:43.499 --> 19:46.371
Well, that's how I decide
whose food not to spit in.

19:46.471 --> 19:48.376
This is the worst idea
in our industry

19:48.376 --> 19:50.246
since tableside guacamole.

19:50.246 --> 19:53.285
Yo! The guy
who tipped Sandee $10,000

19:53.385 --> 19:56.024
is trying to take away
our tips. Get him!

19:58.964 --> 20:00.634
This time it's happening
for real!

20:03.774 --> 20:06.245
I can't believe
I didn't fundamentally change

20:06.345 --> 20:09.251
the service economy
with one awards show speech.

20:09.351 --> 20:12.023
Oh, Homie,
I know it's hard for you

20:12.123 --> 20:14.360
to be generous, but you tried.

20:14.360 --> 20:16.232
And I'm not going
to hold it against you

20:16.232 --> 20:17.902
for taking it too far.

20:17.902 --> 20:20.573
Seeing you bare your soul
on that stage tonight,

20:20.674 --> 20:22.978
it gave me an idea
for how we can fix

20:23.078 --> 20:27.386
our money problems and confront
your addiction to tipping.

20:29.024 --> 20:30.292
Hello, my name is Homer.

20:30.292 --> 20:32.330
And I'll be your server tonight.

20:32.430 --> 20:34.067
Would you like
still or sparkling water?

20:34.167 --> 20:35.436
Just tap.

20:35.436 --> 20:37.040
And more free bread.

20:37.140 --> 20:38.710
Oh...
