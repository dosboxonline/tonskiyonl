00:58.809 --> 01:01.103
-[grunts, groans]
-Hey, what the hell?

01:01.186 --> 01:04.355
-Oh, man, come on. Let's go!
-[teenager 1] Trick or treat!

01:04.438 --> 01:05.649
[teenager 2 chuckles]

01:11.613 --> 01:13.782
[Leanne]
Were you ever afraid of yourself, Mother?

01:16.869 --> 01:17.870
I am.

01:19.955 --> 01:21.498
I've been having these dreams.

01:23.041 --> 01:25.586
There was this black shadow
moving through the house.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.047
Somehow I know that it's me.

01:31.800 --> 01:33.594
I hurt people when I get angry.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.098
Maybe I got that from you.

01:42.436 --> 01:43.645
The scariest part is,

01:43.729 --> 01:46.607
is that I'm starting to like
the way that it feels.

01:50.068 --> 01:54.031
Actually… I love it.

01:57.117 --> 01:58.785
[chuckles]

01:59.286 --> 02:03.790
Now remember, kids,
candies with no wrap might be a trap.

02:03.874 --> 02:07.252
[Walker] Wait a minute.
Who's that 17th-century hunk?

02:07.336 --> 02:10.756
-Oh, Walker, please don't encourage him.
-[Sean] Sorry, what was that, Walker?

02:10.839 --> 02:12.674
-Say that again.
-[Dorothy laughing]

02:12.758 --> 02:14.343
[Melanie] Philadelphia's sweethearts.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.511
[Walker] Yes, they are.

02:15.594 --> 02:17.763
Thanks to our very own Dorothy
as Marie-Antoin--

02:17.846 --> 02:19.973
-[TV turns off]
-Philadelphia's sweethearts, huh?

02:22.267 --> 02:24.603
Hmm. Media loves a power couple.

02:26.230 --> 02:27.231
That was your best year.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.441
What did they use to call you?
"The queen of Halloween"?

02:30.984 --> 02:33.445
Yeah. But things have changed.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.698
No, we're not so different
than we once were.

02:37.824 --> 02:41.203
[clicks tongue]
Sean, we don't have to lie to each other.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.414
We've both made choices.

02:44.498 --> 02:47.584
[stammers] I'm not the same person I was,
neither are you.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.587
[sighs]

02:53.590 --> 02:57.010
[clicks tongue] Thank you for lunch.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.225
[Walker on TV] Meanwhile,
back in Philadelphia, the mid-op--

03:03.308 --> 03:05.060
[footsteps approaching]

03:07.437 --> 03:08.730
[Leanne] What are you doing?

03:10.315 --> 03:11.567
Good morning, dear.

03:11.650 --> 03:15.070
We're on the hunt for
a last-minute costume for Jericho.

03:15.153 --> 03:18.198
Well, those belonged to Dorothy's mother,
and they are not for you to touch.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.409
Are you dressing up tonight?

03:20.492 --> 03:22.786
No. Halloween is for children.

03:22.870 --> 03:28.458
Oh, honey. Beg to differ.
My friends and I used to go wild.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.377
What do you mean?

03:30.460 --> 03:34.673
Well, Halloween's a space
to embrace your fears.

03:34.756 --> 03:38.177
Indulge in your darkest fantasies.

03:38.969 --> 03:41.763
I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.891
[hisses]

03:44.808 --> 03:48.228
[teenagers chuckling,
shouting indistinctly]

03:52.983 --> 03:54.151
Come on!

03:54.651 --> 03:56.570
-Fuck.
-[people laughing]

03:59.364 --> 04:01.825
-[grunts]
-[laughing continues]

04:01.909 --> 04:03.243
I fucking hate this holiday!

04:03.327 --> 04:05.621
This is what happens
when you encourage mischief.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.040
All the goddamn
stunted adolescents in this city

04:08.123 --> 04:11.460
start taking out their aggressions
on the taxpaying citizens of this world.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.004
It's ridiculous. [pants]

04:14.087 --> 04:16.464
-They get your car?
-Brutally. [inhales deeply]

04:16.548 --> 04:18.091
Don't tell me you're decorating.

04:18.175 --> 04:22.053
Dorothy can't do it herself this year,
so I thought this might make her happy.

04:22.554 --> 04:24.932
[scoffs] You thought it might
make her like you, you mean.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.476
[sighs] It's a lost cause, brother.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.396
As long as you and I are Team Leanne,
Dorothy won't have anything to do with us.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.607
I'm not Team Leanne.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.858
You sure about that?

04:34.942 --> 04:37.528
She seems to make everything
work out all right for you.

04:39.988 --> 04:44.076
I've made my peace with how things are.
[inhales deeply] You should too.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.205
Silly String on my fucking gilet!

04:50.249 --> 04:54.086
[children laughing, chattering]

04:56.171 --> 04:58.465
-You think it's horrible.
-[Dorothy] No, no.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.467
[chuckles] He's adorable.

05:00.551 --> 05:03.720
No, y-you can say it. It's awful.

05:04.638 --> 05:07.057
Okay, it's awful. But it's not your fault.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.768
I-I should've gotten him
a costume earlier.

05:09.852 --> 05:13.063
It's just, my mind is in
a million places and--

05:13.146 --> 05:16.900
Oh, not to worry. I'm sure there's
something better somewhere around here.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.570
Well, what you dress him up in last year?

05:19.653 --> 05:22.197
Maybe we could use
a piece of his old costume.

05:22.823 --> 05:26.660
I… I'm not sure.

05:30.622 --> 05:31.623
Can't remember.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.171
[Bev] Well… [chuckles] …i-it's okay.

05:37.254 --> 05:38.547
[Bobbie] Well, think on it, dear.

05:38.630 --> 05:42.676
In the meantime, we'll see if
the stores around here have anything left.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.303
[whispering] Right? Yeah.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.724
[people chattering]

05:58.609 --> 05:59.902
-[coughs]
-[cell phone chimes]

06:07.701 --> 06:09.620
-Sean Turner?
-Yeah.

06:09.703 --> 06:12.831
Wow, it is you.
Man, we're-- we're big fans.

06:12.915 --> 06:15.125
-Ah, thanks.
-Yeah. We watch you every week.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.085
-Thank you, man. I appreciate it.
-No problem.

06:17.169 --> 06:19.505
Happy Halloween. Take care.

06:19.588 --> 06:20.589
You too.

06:21.924 --> 06:24.092
-[people chattering]
-[person] Happy Halloween.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.601
[fan] Love your show, Sean!

07:09.763 --> 07:11.640
[Leanne] These boxes are full of costumes.

07:12.432 --> 07:15.686
They belonged to Dorothy's mother,
so I'll need them back when you're done.

07:16.812 --> 07:19.481
I want you all out on the street tonight,
just in case.

07:20.816 --> 07:22.109
They're coming for me.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.237
They've infiltrated my neighborhood,

07:25.320 --> 07:27.865
and I think they've even bought
one of the houses.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.450
So tonight, I'm going hunting.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.538
They're very good at hiding who they are.

07:36.206 --> 07:38.667
But if I get close enough,
they always reveal themselves.

07:40.878 --> 07:42.754
But tonight we get to hide who we are too.

07:43.589 --> 07:44.590
Come.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.972
[Snake] I never dressed up
for Halloween before.

07:52.848 --> 07:54.683
My dad always said it was sinful.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.810
Can I tell you a secret?

07:59.188 --> 08:00.355
Sin can be fun.

08:03.442 --> 08:04.443
[sighs]

08:05.027 --> 08:07.321
[Walker]
In other news, this year's Mischief Night

08:07.404 --> 08:10.616
brought almost one and a half
million dollars in property damage.

08:10.699 --> 08:14.119
Now to Philadelphia's police commissioner
to discuss the response.

08:15.204 --> 08:18.081
[police commissioner] We won't stand for
mass hysteria in our city.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.918
Tonight, we will have
an increased police presence…

08:21.001 --> 08:25.172
[Bobbie] Someone order
the lobster special? [chuckles]

08:25.255 --> 08:27.883
Oh! Oh… [sucks teeth] …that's precious.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.801
Better than the pumpkin, right?
[chuckling]

08:29.885 --> 08:33.222
Yes, that's good. So good! [chuckles]

08:33.304 --> 08:35.349
Oh. [chuckles] It was Sean's idea.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.683
-[Bev] Oh, what's that?
-Oh.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.477
Oh, it's nothing.

08:40.437 --> 08:44.483
Ooh, got a little secret, have ya? Spill.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.860
Come on, tell us. We won't tell.

08:50.948 --> 08:54.952
What kind of mother can't remember
her child's first costume?

08:55.452 --> 08:56.912
[baby coos]

08:57.538 --> 09:00.374
This isn't the only time
something like this has happened.

09:03.126 --> 09:07.005
There's all this missing time.

09:08.090 --> 09:14.513
Like, this whole period of my life
that I just can't remember,

09:15.681 --> 09:17.641
no matter how hard I try.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.895
It hurts my brain to think about it.

09:23.605 --> 09:26.024
I can't imagine this is normal.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.195
It scares me.

09:30.279 --> 09:33.574
The brain can't hold every memory.

09:34.324 --> 09:37.995
Sometimes you just lose things
as you get older.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.663
[chuckles] Take it from us.

09:41.039 --> 09:42.875
It's probably just aging.

09:44.877 --> 09:46.128
This is something else.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.883
Ladies. Lobster. It's about that time.

09:50.966 --> 09:53.135
-[chuckles]
-[Sean] You ready, little buddy?

09:53.218 --> 09:56.221
I'll keep you on FaceTime so
you feel like you're right there with us.

09:56.305 --> 09:57.306
Thank you.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.684
Oh, God, I wish I could go with you guys.

10:02.144 --> 10:04.897
-Mommy loves you, you little stinker.
-[baby babbling]

10:04.980 --> 10:08.275
Like, one piece of candy.
And don't let him get spooked.

10:08.984 --> 10:09.985
Never.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.120
[person] Boo!

10:20.621 --> 10:22.539
-[laughing] Boo!
-[child shrieks]

10:36.929 --> 10:38.138
-[baby fussing]
-Hey, buddy.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.308
[people chattering]

10:46.730 --> 10:48.732
[muffled music playing]

10:57.533 --> 10:59.535
[sultry music playing]

11:45.247 --> 11:46.248
[music fades]

11:59.970 --> 12:02.973
-[sighs]
-He made me call again. Attachment issues.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.392
[chuckles]
Mommy loves her little crustacean.

12:05.475 --> 12:07.728
[chuckles] Is he having the best time?

12:07.811 --> 12:09.563
Of course. He's your son.

12:10.647 --> 12:11.857
[Dorothy] Sean…

12:14.151 --> 12:15.319
thank you for this.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.196
[Sean] Anything for you.

12:27.706 --> 12:28.999
[Dorothy] Is everything okay?

12:30.959 --> 12:32.419
-What happened?
-No, it's nothing.

12:32.503 --> 12:34.546
I just thought I recognized someone.

12:48.519 --> 12:51.522
[indistinct chatter on television]

12:56.693 --> 12:59.112
Whoa. What are you?

12:59.780 --> 13:00.781
A doll.

13:02.491 --> 13:03.700
I'm going out tonight.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.913
[smacks lips] Um-Um,
Sean took Jericho trick-or-treating,

13:08.539 --> 13:10.207
so left me to man the door.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.835
[inhales deeply]
I could come with you after?

13:14.294 --> 13:15.754
That won't be necessary.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.382
You know, you shouldn't be alone.

13:19.925 --> 13:21.051
I'll be fine.

13:24.513 --> 13:27.432
You know, you don't need to be afraid
for me anymore.

13:28.267 --> 13:29.643
I know what I'm doing.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.737
-[doorbell rings]
-[Leanne chewing]

13:42.656 --> 13:43.657
[sighs]

13:47.369 --> 13:50.163
-Trick or treat.
-[chuckles] Hey, I like your crown.

13:50.247 --> 13:52.040
-Thank you.
-Yeah, take a couple.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.501
Okay.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.255
-Cute. [sighs]
-[doorbell rings]

14:00.007 --> 14:01.091
-Hey.
-Trick or treat.

14:01.175 --> 14:02.885
[Julian chuckles] Okay. Take a couple.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.556
-Help! Help!
-Whoa. Leanne!

14:07.639 --> 14:08.724
Don't eat too much candy…

14:08.807 --> 14:10.726
-Help!
-…or you'll turn into a fat little worm.

14:10.809 --> 14:12.352
-[parent 2] Hey, let go of my kid!
-Nobody loves you.

14:12.436 --> 14:13.854
[crying] Mom! Dad!

14:13.937 --> 14:16.648
I'm so sorry.
She's a theater major. [sighs]

14:17.566 --> 14:19.359
-What the fuck is wrong with you?
-What?

14:19.443 --> 14:22.571
-Halloween's about scaring people, right?
-Yeah, in a PG way.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.782
You don't get extra credit
for tripling people's therapy bills.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.826
[exhales sharply] Now I'm out of candy.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.122
[doorbell rings]

14:49.139 --> 14:50.724
You look fucking amazing.

14:51.642 --> 14:54.061
-What?
-Oh-- [clears throat]

14:54.728 --> 14:57.606
-Tobe. Hi.
-[chuckles] Hi.

14:58.690 --> 15:00.150
Did you make this yourself?

15:00.234 --> 15:01.401
Yeah, kind of.

15:01.485 --> 15:03.028
I mean, that's impressive.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.780
I have things to do.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.657
-You have things to do?
-Mm-hmm.

15:10.744 --> 15:14.122
Well, I'm walking that direction too. Um…

15:14.206 --> 15:16.208
Tobe, I really need to
be on my own tonight.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.043
Okay. Well, how about this?

15:18.126 --> 15:21.213
I'll just walk beside you,
and that way we're alone together.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.175
-Okay. But just for a little.
-Okay.

15:26.718 --> 15:27.845
[exhales deeply]

15:28.762 --> 15:29.763
Sorry, uh,

15:29.847 --> 15:31.890
-if my palms are sweaty, you know.
-No, it's okay.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.934
It's just-- Not that you might be able to…

15:34.434 --> 15:35.936
We should start with that one.

15:36.478 --> 15:37.479
They're new.

15:38.230 --> 15:39.356
Okay.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.733
[cackling on speaker]

15:46.029 --> 15:47.072
Trick or treat.

15:48.282 --> 15:49.533
You're new, right?

15:50.242 --> 15:54.121
We are. Um,
aren't you guys a little too old for this?

15:55.289 --> 15:58.041
-We have thyroid problems.
-Whatever.

15:58.876 --> 16:00.419
Is that really all you have to say to me?

16:01.712 --> 16:02.963
I'm sorry?

16:05.674 --> 16:07.718
[Tobe] Come on, Leanne. Let's go.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.721
-[sighs]
-[scoffs]

16:14.558 --> 16:17.311
[cackling on speaker]

16:17.394 --> 16:18.729
Too old?

16:18.812 --> 16:20.772
Kill me if I'm 30 and that cranky.

16:22.357 --> 16:23.942
Go to your party, Tobe.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.069
What? I thought we were having fun.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.739
I'm sorry.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.534
There are things that I need to do,
and I can't do them when you're around.

16:33.035 --> 16:34.036
W-Wait.

16:35.829 --> 16:36.830
[sighs]

16:47.633 --> 16:48.884
Leave me alone, Tobe.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.638
All right, kids, just one for each of you.

16:53.263 --> 16:56.475
-[child 1] Trick or treat.
-[child 2] Happy Halloween. Thank you.

16:59.436 --> 17:01.647
Hey! Excuse me?

17:01.730 --> 17:03.106
I'm right here. [pants]

17:03.190 --> 17:04.775
Aren't you gonna do something about it?

17:06.108 --> 17:07.819
I'm sorry, do I know you?

17:07.903 --> 17:09.404
Why are you pretending?

17:11.365 --> 17:12.950
I'm right here! Come and get me!

17:13.659 --> 17:14.701
[gasps]

17:16.328 --> 17:18.747
-Oops! [chuckles] I'm sorry, sweetie.
-[dog barking]

17:18.829 --> 17:21.040
I-I think you have the wrong person.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.585
[barking continues]

17:23.669 --> 17:25.170
Here, take some candy.

17:29.174 --> 17:32.427
-Trick or treat!
-[teenagers laughing]

17:37.808 --> 17:39.184
Go home, Tobe.

17:43.230 --> 17:47.526
[cackling, whimpering playing on speakers]

17:58.745 --> 18:00.664
[sighs] Tobe.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.210
You're not Tobe.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.714
[grunts]

18:09.798 --> 18:11.425
[grunting]

18:16.054 --> 18:17.639
[grunts]

18:17.723 --> 18:19.683
I'm not afraid anymore.

18:19.766 --> 18:24.229
-[grunts]
-[screaming, wailing]

18:24.313 --> 18:26.273
Get away from me!
We were just trying to scare you!

18:26.356 --> 18:27.274
It was just a joke!

18:27.357 --> 18:29.860
[crying] Mom! Mom!

18:29.943 --> 18:31.528
Mom!

19:00.349 --> 19:02.559
-[doorbell rings]
-[people screaming]

19:03.060 --> 19:04.186
[knocks on door]

19:07.022 --> 19:09.024
[shouting, cackling]

19:22.496 --> 19:24.581
[person 2] Kids! Eat the kids!

19:25.123 --> 19:29.002
Eat the kids. [groaning]

19:41.098 --> 19:43.433
[muffled screaming, shouting]

20:15.465 --> 20:17.551
[child] Boo! I got you.

20:19.845 --> 20:20.888
Boo.

20:24.766 --> 20:25.809
Boo!

20:36.028 --> 20:37.321
[Leanne] That was very scary.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.491
Do you think that I'm scary?

20:48.999 --> 20:50.375
What about now?

20:51.293 --> 20:53.795
[person 1 on speakers]
Hey! What are you looking at?

20:54.505 --> 20:55.506
[chuckles]

20:55.589 --> 20:58.008
[person 2 on speaker]
I smell fear! [cackling]

20:58.091 --> 20:59.134
What about now?

20:59.843 --> 21:03.138
[clamoring, screaming]

21:08.018 --> 21:10.354
[crying]

21:10.437 --> 21:12.814
[electricity hums]

21:18.737 --> 21:20.989
-[children clamoring]
-[person cackling on speakers]

21:25.619 --> 21:27.955
[person imitates howling]

21:33.335 --> 21:35.796
[growling, cackling through speakers]

21:46.765 --> 21:47.975
They've all gone crazy.

21:48.559 --> 21:50.853
Her ideas are spreading into others.

21:51.812 --> 21:53.689
She's even attacking children.

21:54.565 --> 21:55.858
Poor little lambs.

21:56.817 --> 21:59.069
I worry we waited too long to stop her.

21:59.152 --> 22:03.073
You mean, what we're trying to do,
it might not work?

22:03.866 --> 22:06.493
It has to work. We cannot fail.

22:08.412 --> 22:10.956
I have kids. Okay?

22:11.999 --> 22:14.209
If she finds out and comes after me…

22:14.293 --> 22:18.505
If she wins,
there will be no world for your children.

22:18.589 --> 22:21.300
[inhales shakily] Chaos accelerates.

22:21.383 --> 22:24.845
The city will fall,
and that's only the beginning.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.222
We need you.

22:27.806 --> 22:30.642
[inhales deeply]
You've kept us close to the family,

22:31.310 --> 22:34.396
and they're the only way we can reach her.

22:36.481 --> 22:37.733
Fear not.

22:38.609 --> 22:41.278
Certain pieces are already in place.

22:41.361 --> 22:47.701
[inhales deeply] And if I'm not mistaken,
even the Turners will be ready to help us.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.708
[cackling through speaker]

22:59.087 --> 23:02.674
[laughing]

23:11.558 --> 23:12.643
You're still awake.

23:18.357 --> 23:20.192
I fucking love Halloween.

23:27.282 --> 23:28.992
Is there something you wanna say to me?

23:32.329 --> 23:35.082
I owe you everything, I-- I know that.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.084
And I'm so grateful.

23:39.920 --> 23:45.342
But if it means losing my family,
losing Dorothy, I don't want it.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.927
-I'd give it all up.
-Sean.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.347
You've already made your choice.

23:51.974 --> 23:54.351
So be an adult
and deal with the consequences.

24:03.777 --> 24:04.778
[exhales shakily]

24:05.445 --> 24:07.155
[footsteps approaching]

24:21.503 --> 24:22.588
Dorothy.

24:25.090 --> 24:26.175
Sean.

24:27.009 --> 24:30.053
-I never meant to make a choice.
-[sighs]

24:30.137 --> 24:32.181
I only did what I thought
was best for you.

24:32.681 --> 24:34.016
For our family.

24:35.267 --> 24:36.810
What are you talking about?

24:38.103 --> 24:39.313
I've lost you.

24:39.813 --> 24:41.315
I'm not okay with that.

24:42.399 --> 24:46.570
Julian's right. As long as she's
in the house, you'll never forgive me.

24:48.614 --> 24:49.948
What are you saying, Sean?

24:52.910 --> 24:57.164
I'm prepared to do whatever it takes
to get rid of Leanne.

25:00.375 --> 25:01.668
I'm with you now.

25:02.211 --> 25:03.212
[sighs]
