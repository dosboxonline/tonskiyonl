00:02.878 --> 00:06.924
<i>Let them through!
Let them through! Let them through!</i>

00:07.549 --> 00:10.969
Let them through! Let them through!
Let them through!

00:33.867 --> 00:35.159
What's happening?

00:35.160 --> 00:37.161
Raiders are holding back our deliveries.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.996
- Let them through!
- What deliveries?

00:38.997 --> 00:43.292
All of 'em. Let them through!
Let them through!

00:43.293 --> 00:45.921
Let them through! Let them through!

00:49.842 --> 00:50.843
Easy.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.513
I barely touched you.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.098
Does it hurt?

00:57.099 --> 00:58.976
'Course it fucking hurts.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.438
We should get the whole crew in here.
Let them see you crying about a scrape.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.277
Can you keep it down?

01:11.154 --> 01:12.990
- Thanks.
- You owe me.

01:15.409 --> 01:18.579
Walk, we'll get McLain back.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.165
She's the head of Supply.
She's too important.

01:22.749 --> 01:27.421
She's their enemy, just like us.
So head of anything don't mean nothing.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.800
That sheriff's looking for you,
so you better get moving.

01:32.801 --> 01:34.219
Yeah, looking for you too, Walk.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.971
Well, he's gonna have an easy time then,
isn't he?

01:36.972 --> 01:38.432
'Cause I'm not going anywhere.

01:52.279 --> 01:53.279
Who's this?

01:53.280 --> 01:57.450
Mark, this is Shirley.
She's twice the mechanic I'll ever be.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.911
Well, that ain't hard.

01:59.411 --> 02:00.953
I was wondering when you'd be back.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.705
It's quite the operation you got here.

02:02.706 --> 02:04.750
Yeah, we're small, but we get it done.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.085
Lee.

02:16.929 --> 02:17.930
Shit.

02:21.016 --> 02:24.102
I asked Mark to turn away
anyone asking him to make weapons.

02:25.521 --> 02:26.605
And make them only for you?

02:27.940 --> 02:30.526
Raiders stopping deliveries,

02:31.568 --> 02:35.197
including food and... that's not all.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.034
I came in to do inventory for breakfast
and noticed it on everything.

02:40.035 --> 02:44.081
Fruits. Vegetables. Meat. Even the eggs.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.249
What is it?

02:46.250 --> 02:48.459
Only one thing
has that particular shade of blue.

02:48.460 --> 02:49.711
Rat poison.

02:51.964 --> 02:53.506
You sure?

02:53.507 --> 02:55.551
Something else got here before I did.

02:57.594 --> 03:01.180
Point is, someone did this.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.599
Maybe this is connected
to the food deliveries being stopped.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.268
I wouldn't put it past Bernard,

03:05.269 --> 03:08.522
but that means someone down here
is working for him.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.233
Either way, we're gonna need a new plan.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.443
Let them through!

03:14.444 --> 03:16.655
There is a truth, Mr. Amundsen,

03:17.197 --> 03:21.410
that has applied to human civilization
from the before times until now.

03:22.327 --> 03:28.041
Only nine missed meals
separate a functioning society from chaos.

05:11.562 --> 05:12.812
Who the fuck is that?

05:12.813 --> 05:15.732
This is Felix.
He's been shadowing our doc.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.318
So you think just because
I'm a lowlife criminal

05:19.319 --> 05:22.280
that I... I don't need a doctor?
I just get a shadow?

05:22.281 --> 05:26.576
No. Doc Phelan
went to stay with family in the Mids.

05:26.577 --> 05:27.661
Of course he did.

05:29.121 --> 05:31.957
How old are you anyway, huh, kid?
You started shaving yet?

05:32.541 --> 05:33.916
Have your fucking balls dropped?

05:33.917 --> 05:37.086
The doctor wouldn't have left
if he didn't think his shadow was ready.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.589
And you're sure about that?

05:39.715 --> 05:41.175
You can do this, right?

05:45.137 --> 05:46.138
Just get the bullet out.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.061
Wait, hold on a second.
Hold on one rat-fucking second.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.272
Aren't you forgetting something?

05:57.274 --> 05:59.066
Drugs, Felix.

05:59.067 --> 06:02.236
Before you go digging around,
you need to give me drugs.

06:02.237 --> 06:03.739
And lots of them.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.327
Only doctors have the strong stuff.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.413
I've got aspirin.

06:13.916 --> 06:14.958
He's got aspirin.

06:23.091 --> 06:27.763
You're really gonna arrest them?
Knox, Shirley, Walker?

06:29.848 --> 06:31.933
I took an oath to protect the Pact.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.186
Knox and Shirley need to be brought in

06:35.187 --> 06:37.481
for their own good
and the good of the Silo.

06:51.954 --> 06:54.998
I can help you find them,
if that's what you think we should do.

06:56.875 --> 06:57.960
Clearly, you don't.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.629
It doesn't matter what I think.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.798
When Sheriff Holston had me
put my hand on the Pact,

07:03.799 --> 07:05.008
I swore an oath.

07:05.551 --> 07:09.555
Hank... if they're the solid citizens
you say they are,

07:10.138 --> 07:11.390
they'll turn themselves in.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.812
Let's quiet down now!

07:17.813 --> 07:20.022
Turn yourselves in! Turn yourselves in!

07:20.023 --> 07:21.441
Everyone, shut up!

07:25.362 --> 07:28.991
You've all heard what's being said.
That we killed Judge Meadows.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.327
I swear on my life, that's a lie.

07:33.912 --> 07:37.498
We went up to talk
and found her already dead.

07:37.499 --> 07:41.252
We were framed
by Bernard Holland and Robert Sims,

07:41.253 --> 07:43.421
and we were lucky to make it back alive.

07:43.422 --> 07:45.465
How long are we gonna be alive?

07:47.009 --> 07:50.386
I got two kids,
and I'll go hungry so they can eat,

07:50.387 --> 07:53.098
but what happens
when there's none left for them either?

07:53.724 --> 07:56.393
Are you really gonna make
our children starve for you?

07:59.396 --> 08:01.815
It seems to me like they've already won.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.151
Just look at us,

08:05.152 --> 08:09.114
ready to tear two of our own to pieces
if they don't give themselves up to die.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.368
You know, maybe you want me
to go out there too.

08:13.911 --> 08:14.953
You could do that.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.246
But then, in a couple of days,

08:17.247 --> 08:21.876
you'll see us all out there on that hill,
fallen, where we tried to follow Jules.

08:21.877 --> 08:25.005
Or they'll hang us by a rope
outside Judicial.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.509
You'll have your food deliveries though.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.511
You'll have Bernard
patting your heads saying,

08:31.512 --> 08:33.931
"Good job. Now get back to work."

08:36.308 --> 08:38.100
Is that gonna feel like winning?

08:38.101 --> 08:41.812
No. Well, it sure will to them
'cause this is exactly how they want us,

08:41.813 --> 08:45.233
fighting amongst ourselves,
following their rules,

08:45.234 --> 08:48.529
believing that everything
that goes wrong is our fault.

08:49.488 --> 08:50.989
'Cause that's the way it's always been,

08:52.658 --> 08:54.493
but that doesn't make it right.

08:55.494 --> 08:58.789
We're Mechanical.
We don't fight over food, we share it.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.874
We don't blame each other for shortages,

09:01.875 --> 09:04.502
we pool our resources,
we tighten our belts, we--

09:04.503 --> 09:07.714
We don't wanna starve!
We don't wanna starve!

09:17.432 --> 09:21.812
Listen up! Listen up!
Nobody's starving. Not today. Teddy.

09:25.357 --> 09:28.277
As anyone who's ever worked
the scavenge room knows,

09:29.361 --> 09:33.782
not everything
that comes down the chute is trash.

09:45.377 --> 09:50.464
"To our friends in Mechanical.
Thanks for always keeping the power on.

09:50.465 --> 09:55.095
From your friends on 122. Juliette lives."

10:00.934 --> 10:01.977
Dr. Nichols?

10:04.188 --> 10:05.314
Oh, Kathleen.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.943
What brings you here? Is Claire all right?

10:10.569 --> 10:13.780
Claire is asleep, so I'm fine.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.783
My husband needs a favor.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.330
Is he still down in Mechanical?

10:21.914 --> 10:22.915
He is.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.711
There's someone down there
who needs a doctor.

10:32.883 --> 10:35.092
I think there's a process
for requesting a doctor

10:35.093 --> 10:36.845
through the sheriff's department.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.308
He'd rather not do it that way.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.951
Sir, we're hearing Mechanical's allies
are dropping food down the trash chutes.

10:59.535 --> 11:02.453
Ahead of schedule, which is good news.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.330
It accelerates our time line.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.415
Post raiders at every chute access point.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.543
- Yes, sir.
- Whatever food they received

11:08.544 --> 11:09.962
will run out soon enough.

11:17.845 --> 11:21.431
So, when we run out again, that'll be it?

11:22.349 --> 11:23.350
We surrender?

11:26.728 --> 11:28.105
What level's the barricade?

11:28.772 --> 11:29.773
130.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.279
What if it was on 120?

12:00.179 --> 12:01.846
<i>They are gonna need you down there.</i>

12:01.847 --> 12:03.557
Now more than ever.

12:06.810 --> 12:08.603
All right. All right!

12:08.604 --> 12:11.981
You trying to break the damn door down?

12:11.982 --> 12:13.400
I'm not that deaf.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.320
Walker, this is Sheriff Billings.

12:18.614 --> 12:22.201
You were Juliette's deputy.
You here to arrest me?

12:23.202 --> 12:27.997
First, I'd like to ask you some questions
about what happened to Judge Meadows.

12:27.998 --> 12:29.833
How should I know? I didn't go in.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.960
- Ask Knox and Shirley.
- They must have told you what happened.

12:32.961 --> 12:36.339
Look, I'm not talking about anybody,
let alone Judge Meadows,

12:36.340 --> 12:39.551
until you find out
where they're holding McLain.

12:40.469 --> 12:42.887
Carla McLain. It's head of Supply.

12:42.888 --> 12:45.598
I last saw her in the cafÃ© on 70.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.141
No doubt they've taken her in by now.

12:47.142 --> 12:50.229
And I wanna know
if she's alive and unharmed.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.104
If so, I'll talk to you.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.775
If not,
guess you better find Knox and Shirley.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.153
- Wait.
- I have questions about a murder--

13:08.080 --> 13:09.498
No access beyond here.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.165
I'm a doctor.

13:11.166 --> 13:13.459
There's a medical emergency.
I was asked to help.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.962
Turn around.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.338
Sheriff Billings requested me.

13:17.339 --> 13:20.133
I don't know anything about that,
so you're not getting through.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.931
Go back up.

13:26.515 --> 13:29.934
- A woman's in labor. It's an emergency.
- Who are you?

13:29.935 --> 13:33.146
Kathleen Billings.
My husband is the sheriff.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.108
Do you know what a C-section is?

13:36.608 --> 13:38.819
It's when they cut the baby
out of the mother.

13:39.403 --> 13:42.488
There are two doctors in the Silo
who can perform that operation.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.781
Dr. Nichols is one of them.

13:43.782 --> 13:44.866
Look, I got my orders--

13:44.867 --> 13:47.286
If anything happens to this woman,

13:48.161 --> 13:53.541
you will be in violation of section 12,
subsection six of the Pact,

13:53.542 --> 13:56.420
"Denial of a citizen's access
to lifesaving health care."

14:00.883 --> 14:02.384
Two coming through!

14:02.926 --> 14:04.178
Well, and a baby!

14:04.970 --> 14:06.762
Three coming through! Back away!

14:06.763 --> 14:09.390
You cross, you might not get back!

14:09.391 --> 14:13.269
- Move! Let's go! Move!
- Back up! I said back up!

14:13.270 --> 14:14.479
Move!

14:15.689 --> 14:17.190
It's okay.

14:17.191 --> 14:20.194
Stay back! Back down now.

14:27.201 --> 14:33.081
At first, I tried shifting
one letter forward, like every A is B,

14:33.665 --> 14:35.416
but that didn't add up to anything.

14:35.417 --> 14:38.169
Then I thought, well,
what if it's one letter backwards?

14:38.170 --> 14:39.962
That didn't give you anything either.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.881
No. So, okay,

14:41.882 --> 14:45.843
I thought, well, what if it's, you know,
two or three letters off, you know?

14:45.844 --> 14:46.928
Or even four or five?

14:46.929 --> 14:49.805
And so I started doing it all by hand,

14:49.806 --> 14:51.015
but I thought, you know,

14:51.016 --> 14:53.519
- it'd be faster to just write a program.
- Smart.

14:54.186 --> 14:56.688
What you're doing
is called a Caesar shift, by the way.

14:58.482 --> 15:00.400
It's a long story.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.153
Keep at it.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.132
Mrs. Sims.

15:24.967 --> 15:25.968
Mayor Holland.

15:33.559 --> 15:35.686
Camille, I heard that

15:36.979 --> 15:40.315
you helped Judge Meadows's murderers
the other day.

15:45.529 --> 15:50.157
I answered a request
for all former raiders to report for duty

15:50.158 --> 15:51.326
and help with the hunt.

15:51.827 --> 15:55.830
When I got to 90, I noticed two citizens
being harassed by some locals.

15:55.831 --> 15:57.331
I took them to a safe place.

15:57.332 --> 15:58.916
Then I radioed Judicial Security,

15:58.917 --> 16:01.169
told them where they were
and to send an extraction team,

16:01.170 --> 16:02.461
and I'd meet them on the stairs.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.131
Why didn't you wait
until the team got there?

16:05.132 --> 16:06.466
Because no team was sent.

16:07.259 --> 16:08.551
I was told unofficially

16:08.552 --> 16:11.930
that justice needed to come
from the citizens of the Silo.

16:13.599 --> 16:16.225
I was approached
by a group of these citizens,

16:16.226 --> 16:19.103
several of them raiders I knew,
now in civilian clothes,

16:19.104 --> 16:21.480
and they asked
where I'd stashed the two suspects.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.191
But you didn't tell them.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.567
Of course not.

16:24.568 --> 16:28.197
I knew from my time in Judicial
that vigilante justice is against the law.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.033
And we all have to obey the law.

16:31.533 --> 16:32.534
Yes.

16:43.420 --> 16:48.509
You know, it was your husband
who instructed the crowd to go get them.

16:52.888 --> 16:58.894
I'm curious what his response was
when you told him about this.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.941
He's the judge now. He understood.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.027
Of course he did.

17:10.948 --> 17:11.949
Yes.

17:26.171 --> 17:28.841
We've got this for now. Come on!

17:31.969 --> 17:34.596
Go get a hot meal in the cafeteria.
We got this.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.768
What the actual fuck?

17:40.978 --> 17:43.563
Radio Amundsen.
We need tactical defense equipment.

17:43.564 --> 17:45.732
- Tactical defense?
- Guns. We need guns.

17:47.985 --> 17:50.028
Mr. Amundsen. This is Unit 19.

17:50.821 --> 17:52.029
This is Amundsen. Go.

17:52.030 --> 17:54.615
Sir, there may be
a situation brewing here.

17:54.616 --> 17:56.869
We need
advanced tactical defense equipment.

18:00.455 --> 18:01.330
Fuck.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.959
- Sir, my aunt on 135 just--
- Not now.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.045
Okay.

18:31.069 --> 18:33.405
- Where's the patient?
- Okay, he's over there.

18:33.947 --> 18:34.989
Thank you.

18:34.990 --> 18:36.116
Honey.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.830
Honey, what are you doing?

18:42.831 --> 18:44.081
Dr. Nichols could use my help.

18:44.082 --> 18:46.042
I told you, it's not safe down here.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.586
Paul, it's not safe anywhere.

18:48.504 --> 18:49.505
Hey.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.632
Very touching family reunion.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.884
But you think maybe we could
get this fucking bullet out?

18:54.885 --> 18:55.968
That'd be great.

18:55.969 --> 18:58.804
Hey, come here. Hey.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.432
- Okay.
- Are you okay?

19:01.058 --> 19:02.351
I missed you.

19:04.436 --> 19:07.397
See Mama? Are you looking around?

19:18.325 --> 19:19.618
Why am I here, Diego?

19:20.285 --> 19:23.079
Mechanical is massing
for an assault on the barricade.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.539
They have weapons and armor--

19:24.540 --> 19:26.624
I'm sure Mr. Amundsen is aware.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.836
He is, but he doesn't know what I know.

19:29.920 --> 19:33.422
We have been relying on listeners
since the cameras below 120 went out.

19:33.423 --> 19:34.758
I don't trust 'em.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.053
Someone I do trust is my aunt.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.680
She's on 135, and she sent a message

19:40.681 --> 19:43.140
saying a bunch of Down-Deepers
were marching up with weapons--

19:43.141 --> 19:44.767
Didn't you already tell me that?

19:44.768 --> 19:47.645
She said there was a second group
heading the other direction.

19:47.646 --> 19:50.107
They had weapons and a saw.

19:52.109 --> 19:53.651
My aunt's in construction.

19:53.652 --> 19:56.530
She said it was the kind of saw
they use to cut through concrete.

20:19.928 --> 20:20.929
Clear.

20:38.947 --> 20:39.948
Sorry to bo...

20:40.699 --> 20:42.576
What the fuck are you doing here?

20:43.118 --> 20:45.161
You're supposed to be in the mines.

20:45.162 --> 20:46.872
Mayor Holland needed my help.

20:48.123 --> 20:49.208
With what?

20:51.126 --> 20:52.251
Some programming.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.337
Where is he?

20:53.921 --> 20:54.755
I don't know.

21:23.909 --> 21:25.743
Can you feel this, Mr. Kennedy?

21:25.744 --> 21:27.746
Yeah, I can. I just don't care.

21:39.591 --> 21:40.759
There it is.

21:45.722 --> 21:48.141
You think they have a team
cutting up through the floor?

21:50.561 --> 21:52.479
And neither Amundsen nor Bernard know?

21:56.733 --> 21:57.775
There's nothing wrong

21:57.776 --> 21:59.736
with letting people suffer
their own mistakes.

22:00.612 --> 22:03.739
As long as the mistake
doesn't endanger everyone else,

22:03.740 --> 22:05.617
including our son.

22:07.828 --> 22:10.831
You can't do anything.
You're the judge now.

22:13.250 --> 22:16.920
I know. Besides, I was never a raider.

22:42.988 --> 22:44.405
- What are they doing?
- We can't see.

22:44.406 --> 22:45.698
Sounds like they were drilling.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.617
Yeah, I know
what drilling sounds like, Derek.

22:47.618 --> 22:48.910
Where are the guns?

22:48.911 --> 22:50.204
Just leaving the armory.

22:56.001 --> 22:57.586
It didn't get your lung.

22:58.170 --> 22:59.420
You're a lucky man.

22:59.421 --> 23:02.758
Yes, sir. That's me. Mr. Lucky.

23:04.384 --> 23:06.428
I held up my end of the deal, Mr. Kennedy.

23:08.388 --> 23:09.389
Let's talk.

23:10.140 --> 23:13.685
You were being serious?
I just wanted to get the bullet out.

23:14.478 --> 23:15.854
Come on now, Mr. Kennedy.

23:17.105 --> 23:20.859
Deputy Hank took time out of his busy day
to hear what you have to say.

23:21.818 --> 23:22.902
I'm feeling a little woozy,

23:22.903 --> 23:25.530
what with the drugs
and having a bullet dug out of me.

23:25.531 --> 23:26.698
You know, maybe tomorrow.

23:28.158 --> 23:29.493
Bandage all good?

23:31.537 --> 23:32.538
I'll take her.

23:37.709 --> 23:38.794
Here you go.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.300
Dr. Nichols,

23:46.301 --> 23:47.970
I'd like a word with the patient.

23:55.686 --> 23:57.019
You should probably go too, Hank.

23:57.020 --> 23:58.355
Maybe he should stay.

23:58.981 --> 24:01.232
You know,
taking all that time and everything.

24:01.233 --> 24:02.526
I'll fill him in.

24:05.571 --> 24:06.572
All right.

24:10.325 --> 24:11.535
Oopsie.

24:12.494 --> 24:14.037
Looks like I made Daddy mad.

24:16.957 --> 24:18.041
Not really.

24:20.878 --> 24:22.045
You're a criminal.

24:23.046 --> 24:24.506
I don't expect much.

24:26.175 --> 24:27.676
But I need what I need,

24:29.720 --> 24:33.724
which is you telling me
what you said you were going to tell me.

24:44.318 --> 24:45.569
'Cause if you don't...

24:49.156 --> 24:50.574
I'll radio Judge Sims.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.075
What?

24:53.076 --> 24:54.286
That's right.

24:55.245 --> 24:56.580
He's Judge now.

24:57.873 --> 25:00.501
I'll tell him where you are,
and who knows?

25:02.336 --> 25:04.713
Maybe he'll put you back in that box.

25:05.797 --> 25:06.882
Or worse.

25:07.883 --> 25:10.594
Okay. Okay.

25:12.596 --> 25:14.263
You're not gonna wanna hear
what I have to say.

25:14.264 --> 25:18.185
- Why?
- Because it'll ruin your fucking life.

25:21.104 --> 25:22.564
When Nichols was on the run,

25:23.190 --> 25:25.192
you happen to be
near a computer when they went dark?

25:27.361 --> 25:29.946
- Do you know why they went dark?
- It was a systems reboot.

25:29.947 --> 25:33.700
That's what they said,
but they say all kinds of shit.

25:36.078 --> 25:37.828
They went dark because Nichols
had my friend Danny

25:37.829 --> 25:40.456
put something
on every computer in the Silo

25:40.457 --> 25:43.167
for ten seconds before they shut it down.

25:43.168 --> 25:44.086
What'd he put up?

25:45.462 --> 25:47.339
I bet they rounded up
everybody who saw it.

25:48.298 --> 25:49.341
Me and Danny...

25:51.009 --> 25:52.844
Who knows what the hell they did to him?

25:52.845 --> 25:55.555
They gagged and bagged us
so we couldn't tell anything to anybody.

25:55.556 --> 25:56.765
Tell anyone what, man?

26:02.312 --> 26:03.397
It's like the page...

26:05.482 --> 26:08.902
only a million times more beautiful.

26:10.529 --> 26:14.324
I couldn't describe it if I fucking tried.

26:19.705 --> 26:21.415
Where does Sims come into this?

26:22.624 --> 26:27.212
Not long after Nichols gets sent out,
Sims comes to me, wants to make a deal.

26:28.130 --> 26:31.300
I put on dirty clothes,
head down to Greasetown,

26:32.718 --> 26:34.428
toss a firebomb at Hank's station.

26:37.681 --> 26:40.434
In return, he'd give me drugs.

26:41.894 --> 26:44.521
Make me forget everything that's
happened to me in the last 22 years.

26:46.857 --> 26:49.860
Obviously, he never intended
to hold up his end.

26:51.403 --> 26:53.779
And the magic forgetting drugs
are probably bullshit,

26:53.780 --> 26:56.158
but I didn't have a lot of options
with a hood over my head.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.705
Now, let me ask you a question.

27:04.541 --> 27:07.294
Isn't there just a little piece of you
that wishes I never told you that?

27:13.133 --> 27:16.595
If our roles were switched,

27:17.763 --> 27:19.515
would you have done the same?

27:32.945 --> 27:34.780
What if I failed, Mary?

27:40.536 --> 27:44.247
140 years of stability,

27:44.248 --> 27:49.878
and it could all end on my watch.

27:51.964 --> 27:52.965
I...

27:55.425 --> 27:57.636
I made the calculations, I...

28:01.390 --> 28:03.767
I planned for everything.

28:05.394 --> 28:09.064
Then... events

28:10.732 --> 28:11.817
forced me...

28:16.363 --> 28:18.156
...to factor you in...

28:21.118 --> 28:22.703
to the calculation.

28:36.133 --> 28:39.970
For that, I'm truly sorry.

29:01.033 --> 29:02.826
Set up a tactical formation here.

29:04.161 --> 29:05.537
Two lines. Now!

29:38.779 --> 29:40.739
- What are you doing?
- There's gonna be an ambush.

29:41.448 --> 29:43.784
- From where?
- They're coming up through the floor.

29:45.661 --> 29:46.494
What?

29:46.495 --> 29:48.247
This is our level!

29:49.873 --> 29:50.791
Guys!

30:01.009 --> 30:01.927
Over there!

30:04.763 --> 30:05.597
Now!

30:14.022 --> 30:15.147
They're gonna pinch us.

30:15.148 --> 30:16.775
Fall back! Go!

30:27.327 --> 30:28.661
Go, go, go!

30:28.662 --> 30:30.622
Come on!

30:44.553 --> 30:45.762
Stop!

31:06.783 --> 31:08.452
You will kill ten of us...

31:10.370 --> 31:11.580
but we will kill all of you...

31:14.208 --> 31:15.709
and take the stairs.

31:22.549 --> 31:24.759
How about
we make this level the new boundary?

31:24.760 --> 31:26.136
That work?

31:50.244 --> 31:52.745
Mr. Mayor, it wasn't optimum,
but they only got ten floors.

31:52.746 --> 31:54.248
"Not optimum."

31:55.415 --> 31:58.085
What level is the new barricade on?

31:58.919 --> 31:59.962
One t... 120.

32:00.462 --> 32:03.298
And what is down on level 122?

32:04.633 --> 32:06.635
Without looking at a map. Anyone?

32:07.761 --> 32:08.971
What's on 122?

32:09.555 --> 32:12.683
Lower Mids farm. It's a farm level.

32:14.101 --> 32:17.854
We're trying to starve them
into submission and now they have a farm.

32:17.855 --> 32:21.066
So, yeah, not optimum.

32:28.073 --> 32:30.741
I heard there was
some kind of a battle on the stairs.

32:30.742 --> 32:31.868
Shouldn't you be there?

32:31.869 --> 32:36.081
I've been busy finding out
what happened to Carla McLain.

32:43.463 --> 32:46.841
She was arrested at that cafÃ© on 70.

32:46.842 --> 32:48.677
Yeah, where I left her.

32:49.636 --> 32:50.679
So, where is she now?

32:51.513 --> 32:54.308
People usually get transferred to us
for processing,

32:54.975 --> 32:57.476
but Hank's checked in
with every deputy station.

32:57.477 --> 32:58.687
None of them have her.

32:59.313 --> 33:00.314
So, where is she?

33:01.106 --> 33:02.107
In a hospital?

33:03.150 --> 33:07.695
Sometimes,
when raiders have a high-profile,

33:07.696 --> 33:11.450
high-risk suspect,
they're taken into seclusion.

33:12.117 --> 33:15.203
No, they can't do that.
No, Carla has health issues.

33:15.204 --> 33:16.371
She won't survive.

33:17.539 --> 33:19.708
Look, you're the sheriff.
You can do something.

33:20.209 --> 33:23.669
I might be able to get her out,
but only if I can clear her name.

33:23.670 --> 33:27.382
So, please,
what happened to Judge Meadows?

33:34.306 --> 33:35.723
Hell of a plan today.

33:35.724 --> 33:38.893
Well, haven't you heard?
I'm twice the mechanic you'll ever be.

33:38.894 --> 33:40.228
What idiot told you that?

33:40.229 --> 33:44.690
Which means twice the thinker,
twice the engineer.

33:44.691 --> 33:46.860
See, this is why I don't
give people compliments.

34:00.832 --> 34:01.834
To teamwork.

34:04.837 --> 34:05.921
To great partners.

34:25.482 --> 34:27.568
We under arrest, Sheriff?

34:30.195 --> 34:33.782
Martha Walker has given me her account
of what happened with Meadows.

34:34.574 --> 34:36.492
Or at least what she says you told her.

34:36.493 --> 34:39.204
That you walked in
and found the judge dead.

34:40.163 --> 34:43.750
You said Bernard Holland
and Robert Sims were framing you.

34:44.877 --> 34:47.004
Would you swear on the Pact that's true?

34:48.463 --> 34:49.464
Every word.

34:54.094 --> 34:56.221
Sheriff Billings for Mayor Holland.

34:58.599 --> 35:00.225
Sheriff Billings for Mayor Holland.

35:02.769 --> 35:03.769
Speaking.

35:03.770 --> 35:05.397
I've located the fugitives.

35:05.898 --> 35:08.358
Excellent news, Sheriff.
Thank you. Where are they?

35:14.281 --> 35:16.116
I'm not revealing their location
at this time.

35:17.659 --> 35:19.994
First, I need to open
a full investigation into the events

35:19.995 --> 35:21.412
leading to the death of Judge Meadows,

35:21.413 --> 35:23.623
- <i>as well as a new investigation...</i>
- Disable all radio communication

35:23.624 --> 35:25.249
- in the Silo. Now.
- <i>...attack on the deputy station</i>

35:25.250 --> 35:27.418
in the Down Deep,
which cost two lives, and--

35:27.419 --> 35:30.838
Fuck me. I just lost the sheriff.

35:30.839 --> 35:31.924
Mayor?

35:36.303 --> 35:37.304
Thank you.

35:39.681 --> 35:40.682
For what?

35:42.559 --> 35:46.355
I don't stand with the mayor,
or the judge, or you.

35:48.941 --> 35:50.234
I stand with the law.

36:01.370 --> 36:03.872
Paul, you okay?

36:07.918 --> 36:09.586
You did a very brave thing today.

36:10.754 --> 36:11.797
Brave? Maybe.

36:12.881 --> 36:14.424
Stupid? Definitely.

36:17.469 --> 36:19.388
I doubt I'll be sheriff much longer.

36:20.097 --> 36:22.640
It wasn't stupid
and it was the right thing.

36:22.641 --> 36:23.809
People will see that.

36:25.477 --> 36:27.312
I'm not sure it was right either.

36:33.610 --> 36:35.237
When was the last time
you took your herbs?

36:38.115 --> 36:39.949
I'm sorry, honey, I forgot.

36:39.950 --> 36:41.702
I'm not criticizing.

36:44.037 --> 36:46.456
- Can you pass me that glass of water?
- Right, yeah.

36:53.422 --> 36:54.547
What are you...

36:54.548 --> 36:55.632
Look.

36:59.178 --> 37:00.262
Why do you think that is?

37:02.556 --> 37:03.473
I...

37:03.974 --> 37:05.851
You haven't taken your herbs in days.

37:11.732 --> 37:13.192
But I don't know what's changed.

37:13.775 --> 37:14.860
Maybe you have.

37:17.070 --> 37:18.821
So, this is Quinn's code,

37:18.822 --> 37:23.242
but with the alphabet reversed
and shifted three letters over.

37:23.243 --> 37:24.994
Doesn't look like anything.

37:24.995 --> 37:26.079
It's gobbledygook.

37:26.663 --> 37:29.290
Right, except here...

37:29.291 --> 37:30.250
"Sillo."

37:32.377 --> 37:36.047
I doubt that Salvador Quinn
would spell "silo" wrong.

37:36.048 --> 37:38.090
I thought the same. So, okay.

37:38.091 --> 37:44.515
Here's another iteration, still reversed,
but shifted over ten.

37:50.312 --> 37:51.396
"Allie."

37:53.857 --> 37:56.818
Quinn's daughter's name was Allie.
You might be onto something.

37:57.653 --> 37:58.737
Right.

37:59.488 --> 38:04.158
Except that none of the other words,
you know, are coherent.

38:04.159 --> 38:09.622
Well, this is far beyond a Caesar shift.

38:09.623 --> 38:11.333
This is sophisticated.

38:12.125 --> 38:13.919
It's a code within a code.

38:15.087 --> 38:17.798
In order to decipher it,
you would have to...

38:21.385 --> 38:22.386
What?

38:23.512 --> 38:25.013
You'd have to see the Legacy.

38:25.722 --> 38:28.725
Legacy? I don't know what that is.

38:29.434 --> 38:31.395
Stand up. Stand up!

38:33.647 --> 38:35.983
Lukas Kyle,
I am electing you to be my shadow.

38:36.567 --> 38:38.652
Please place your right hand on the Pact.

38:40.320 --> 38:41.321
Do you accept?

38:44.366 --> 38:45.367
Yes.

38:45.868 --> 38:46.869
Repeat after me.

38:48.287 --> 38:50.747
I, Lukas Kyle...

38:58.714 --> 39:01.592
If you're a friend, come in.
If not, go away.

39:05.554 --> 39:07.556
I hope you still consider me a friend.

39:12.769 --> 39:14.396
It's been a long time.

39:18.859 --> 39:22.571
I wanted to thank you
for taking care of her all these years.

39:23.155 --> 39:25.866
You know, it was her who took care of us.

39:27.451 --> 39:28.993
One of the engineers told me

39:28.994 --> 39:32.039
you managed to have a different tape
used for Juliette's cleaning.

39:33.415 --> 39:34.291
Is that true?

39:35.667 --> 39:36.668
Yes.

39:38.170 --> 39:40.088
That's why she was able
to walk out of sight?

39:45.677 --> 39:47.262
Do you think she's still alive?

39:49.556 --> 39:50.557
No.

39:51.642 --> 39:53.393
Then why give us false hope?

39:55.354 --> 39:57.147
I did it for her, Doctor.

39:58.524 --> 40:01.317
And for you and me, and for everyone
down here who knew and loved her,

40:01.318 --> 40:04.071
and, yeah,
some days wanted to strangle her.

40:06.114 --> 40:11.370
I did it because I knew she wouldn't want
any of us to watch her dying on that hill.

40:16.917 --> 40:18.794
But you don't think she's still alive.

40:20.629 --> 40:21.755
I don't see how.

40:37.104 --> 40:38.272
Hey.

40:39.439 --> 40:41.108
You're awake. Good.

40:46.196 --> 40:48.740
You had an infection. It was a bad one.

40:51.827 --> 40:54.453
Nice to know
that those antibiotics worked.

40:54.454 --> 40:57.874
I made 'em all by myself not too long ago.

40:57.875 --> 40:59.042
I got a helmet.

41:00.586 --> 41:03.422
Where is it? I need to go.
I need to get my suit on.

41:06.300 --> 41:08.802
Yeah, about the suit...

41:09.970 --> 41:11.888
It's safe.

41:11.889 --> 41:13.182
You're gonna get it back.

41:13.682 --> 41:16.018
First, I need you to fix that pump.

41:17.352 --> 41:18.353
What?

41:18.854 --> 41:21.981
You said that if you could get power

41:21.982 --> 41:23.566
- to the pump under the surface...
- No.

41:23.567 --> 41:25.026
...you could stop the water from rising.

41:25.027 --> 41:27.112
Get me my suit.

41:28.322 --> 41:29.739
All right. Well...

41:29.740 --> 41:33.951
think of it as doing me a favor, like,
I saved your life, you save mine,

41:33.952 --> 41:35.119
and then we'll be even.

41:35.120 --> 41:36.204
- Even?
- Yeah.

41:36.205 --> 41:38.789
You're one person.
There's 10,000 fucking people--

41:38.790 --> 41:40.750
Yeah, 10,000 people
that could die any day now.

41:40.751 --> 41:42.585
Just like the people of this silo died.

41:42.586 --> 41:46.088
Look, you can waste time arguing with me

41:46.089 --> 41:49.426
or you can start thinking
about how you're gonna fix that pump.

41:51.303 --> 41:52.304
It's up to you.
