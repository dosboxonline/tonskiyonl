01:30.024 --> 01:31.424
My name is tse Mei-ying.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.829
But people call me sister tse.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.734
I never believed in
the American dream.

01:41.802 --> 01:43.470
All I knew was how to survive.

02:11.198 --> 02:13.100
I made a deal with a
snakehead from Taiwan.

02:16.070 --> 02:18.605
Prostitution for
smuggling me to New York.

02:25.913 --> 02:30.017
I knew we could die, but
we all have our reasons.

02:44.098 --> 02:47.634
Get on the ground!

04:01.674 --> 04:03.610
At approximately 4 A.M. today,

04:03.643 --> 04:06.213
a cargo boat with hundreds
of smuggled Chinese migrants

04:06.247 --> 04:10.084
was intercepted by the FBI
off of rockaway beach, queens.

04:10.117 --> 04:13.087
Chinese human smugglers,
often known as snakeheads,

04:13.120 --> 04:15.622
have shown a reckless
disregard for the health

04:15.655 --> 04:18.225
and safety of the
migrants being smuggled.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.701
Fuck out of my face.

04:28.735 --> 04:29.636
Huh?

04:29.669 --> 04:30.905
Anybody else want a home run?

04:30.938 --> 04:31.938
Come on.

04:33.706 --> 04:35.376
Now you shut the fuck up.

04:35.409 --> 04:36.844
Welcome to america.

06:02.830 --> 06:05.232
- Here you go, drink!
- Cheers!

06:06.233 --> 06:08.002
- Barbie.
- Let's go.

06:08.035 --> 06:09.270
Hey, come, sit.

06:18.778 --> 06:20.713
You wanna eat, you guys hungry?

06:24.285 --> 06:26.220
Maybe I went the
light way before.

06:30.457 --> 06:32.359
Hey you, how much you owe?

06:37.298 --> 06:41.268
Drink, it'll
make you feel better.

06:45.339 --> 06:49.243
I owed $57,000 to the snakehead.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.946
All that mattered
was that I was here.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.285
We all have our reasons.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.358
I came to america
to find my daughter.

07:35.556 --> 07:37.258
Put some makeup on.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.325
Time for work.

07:49.903 --> 07:51.272
Hi.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.474
My name is Steve, Steven.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.175
What's your name?

08:23.604 --> 08:25.339
Bitch, you bit me!

08:29.410 --> 08:31.078
Fuck!

08:31.111 --> 08:32.279
The fuck is going on?

10:57.724 --> 10:59.693
Kill the bitch, dai mah!

11:02.329 --> 11:04.064
She tried to kill me!

11:04.097 --> 11:06.366
What would you do if
somebody fucked you up?

11:22.382 --> 11:24.351
Everyone has to
work and earn here.

11:25.519 --> 11:28.255
I can work, I can earn.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.323
Just give me a chance.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.024
I just gave you a chance.

11:32.292 --> 11:36.997
That kind of work
is for the weak.

11:37.631 --> 11:38.532
I'm not weak.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.001
Ah, so you think I'm unfair?

11:43.437 --> 11:44.437
No.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.406
There are rules.

11:47.774 --> 11:51.078
Chinatown doesn't
change for anyone.

11:56.316 --> 11:57.316
Come on.

12:07.594 --> 12:08.594
This is Hong.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.798
He came here for the
same reasons you did.

12:16.336 --> 12:19.473
But he betrayed me, my family,

12:21.275 --> 12:22.275
and you.

12:24.645 --> 12:26.814
He set up the FBI ship raid.

12:32.185 --> 12:36.156
So sister tse, what would you do

12:37.224 --> 12:38.826
if someone betrayed your family?

14:32.305 --> 14:34.608
I didn't always
make the right choice,

14:35.575 --> 14:36.677
but I always survived.

14:46.353 --> 14:49.322
After I got caught, went
to jail for eight years.

14:52.894 --> 14:56.530
They took my daughter away, and
she was adopted in New York.

14:59.599 --> 15:02.436
When I got out, I
vowed to find her.

15:39.573 --> 15:40.573
Hey.

15:43.010 --> 15:45.445
Uh, no.

15:45.479 --> 15:46.948
Come on, let me show you.

15:46.981 --> 15:48.415
At first...

15:48.448 --> 15:49.683
Get the right amount of meat.

15:49.716 --> 15:51.384
I didn't trust zareeb.

15:51.418 --> 15:52.820
Water here.

15:52.854 --> 15:54.321
Helps it stick, you know?

15:54.354 --> 15:57.691
- But in the end...
- Fold it over, pinch.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.626
He was my only friend.

15:59.659 --> 16:00.962
Voila.

16:00.995 --> 16:01.995
You try.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.065
We were the same.

16:04.098 --> 16:07.367
You know, america
is tough, but look,

16:07.400 --> 16:08.480
at least we have jobs here.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.939
We both depended
on dai mah to survive.

16:11.973 --> 16:13.573
Might need a lot more practice.

16:14.474 --> 16:16.276
You'll get it, you're smart.

16:24.886 --> 16:27.287
You from fuzhou or guangdong?

16:30.199 --> 16:31.408
Where are you from?

16:34.829 --> 16:35.829
You speak Chinese?

16:36.622 --> 16:37.622
Just a little.

16:38.207 --> 16:39.416
But my French is much better.

16:43.403 --> 16:44.437
Look.

16:45.539 --> 16:46.974
My wife come here soon.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.744
Then I'm going to open
my own restaurant,

16:50.777 --> 16:52.512
zareeb's famous dumplings.

16:54.748 --> 16:56.083
You have a family here?

17:01.388 --> 17:02.756
Get back to work.

17:02.789 --> 17:03.790
Come on, dai mah.

17:03.825 --> 17:06.060
We got labor laws, I get breaks.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.330
Hey, you hear boss
lady, let's go.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.733
No, you stay.

17:15.903 --> 17:17.839
I've got some other
jobs that pay more.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.339
How much?

17:39.026 --> 17:40.393
What'd you bring me?

17:45.132 --> 17:48.936
Zareeb really does
make good dumplings.

17:51.973 --> 17:53.841
Can I trust you with money?

17:56.110 --> 17:57.410
I need a new collector.

18:00.014 --> 18:02.817
My clients respond better
to women than pai gwut.

18:04.852 --> 18:06.020
What's in it for me?

18:07.154 --> 18:10.724
Give you a list, you collect.

18:10.757 --> 18:14.728
I take $200 out each
month of what you owe.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.763
If they don't pay?

18:18.498 --> 18:19.499
They will.

18:25.907 --> 18:26.907
Feeling lucky?

18:30.144 --> 18:31.411
Well here's your tip.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.969
You should use the ones
with the copper coating.

20:02.003 --> 20:05.172
To round the corners,
a dead giveaway.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.258
There is a saying
where I'm from.

20:26.360 --> 20:29.163
When drinking water,
remember the source.

20:30.764 --> 20:32.632
I knew why I was here.

21:13.407 --> 21:16.177
Four months I couldn't find her,

21:17.178 --> 21:20.047
and then one day, there she was.

21:31.158 --> 21:33.693
Every Sunday I
followed her to church.

21:36.964 --> 21:40.101
Even after eight years, a
mother knows her daughter.

22:07.027 --> 22:08.095
My search was over.

22:09.163 --> 22:11.031
But I didn't know
what to do next.

22:28.349 --> 22:30.317
Dai mah's smuggling
empire kept the peace

22:30.351 --> 22:32.920
in a dying Chinatown underworld.

22:32.953 --> 22:35.256
Import-export
companies, truck drivers

22:35.289 --> 22:38.259
and employment agencies
all depended on her.

22:38.292 --> 22:40.727
For them, smuggling
was harmless.

22:41.896 --> 22:43.336
But everyone knew
this wouldn't last.

22:44.465 --> 22:46.367
If they kept quiet,
they got to eat.

22:47.401 --> 22:49.136
Even Rambo's girlfriend sinh

22:49.170 --> 22:51.071
got closer to the
operation every day.

22:53.140 --> 22:54.275
Pai gwut remained loyal.

22:57.278 --> 22:58.846
And no matter how mad he got,

22:58.879 --> 23:00.014
no wrong respect Rambo.

23:03.284 --> 23:04.784
Everyone knew who fed them.

23:08.889 --> 23:10.300
Alright, y'all
better put your hands,

23:10.324 --> 23:11.992
put your motherfucking hands up!

23:15.829 --> 23:17.831
Shut up!

23:18.866 --> 23:19.866
Shut up!

23:21.902 --> 23:24.737
Thank you for coming.

23:26.173 --> 23:29.043
My first birthday party
I've ever had in my life.

23:30.411 --> 23:32.112
I hate all of you fuckers!

23:32.146 --> 23:35.115
Not one of you visited
me when I was locked up!

23:35.149 --> 23:36.149
So fuck you!

23:38.919 --> 23:43.924
I wanna dedicate this
evening to the one woman

23:45.292 --> 23:46.894
that means everything to me.

23:48.829 --> 23:50.231
I love you, ma.

23:50.264 --> 23:53.334
That's my mom!

23:56.904 --> 23:58.505
I'm gonna sing you a song, ma.

23:58.539 --> 24:00.207
What the fuck,

24:00.241 --> 24:01.551
- you think you can touch me?
- What the fuck?

24:01.575 --> 24:03.053
- You don't get to touch her!
- What the fuck?

24:03.077 --> 24:04.311
Big bro, big bro!

24:04.345 --> 24:06.447
No, no, chill, big bro!

24:06.480 --> 24:07.780
Chill, big bro!

24:07.815 --> 24:08.949
Big bro, chill, chill!

24:16.290 --> 24:17.891
Your soba better.

24:18.592 --> 24:19.493
Let me help.

24:19.526 --> 24:21.095
No, I don't need help.

24:21.128 --> 24:23.831
Come on, sister tse,
everybody needs help sometime.

24:25.099 --> 24:27.034
How long have you
been working for them?

24:27.067 --> 24:28.869
About three years now.

24:28.902 --> 24:30.537
I was here before Rambo got out.

24:34.108 --> 24:35.409
What did he do?

24:35.442 --> 24:36.442
You didn't hear?

24:38.078 --> 24:39.413
His father was a drunk.

24:39.446 --> 24:42.583
Used to come home and
beat dai mah every day.

24:42.616 --> 24:45.185
One day Rambo grew
up, killed him.

24:48.289 --> 24:49.289
Killed him?

24:50.324 --> 24:51.434
The rest of the family's fine.

24:51.458 --> 24:53.427
He's got a brother
on wall street.

24:53.460 --> 24:55.429
Rambo's just the
black sheep, you know?

24:56.463 --> 24:58.065
So how much do you owe them?

24:59.166 --> 25:01.302
53,200.

25:01.335 --> 25:03.203
Wow!

25:03.237 --> 25:05.939
So when you were dreaming
of coming to america,

25:05.973 --> 25:07.908
did you think it was
gonna be this way?

25:09.643 --> 25:11.578
I didn't think, I just came.

25:27.961 --> 25:28.962
Hey yo.

25:29.296 --> 25:31.098
Feed the pair fish with this,

25:31.131 --> 25:33.200
and then wipe down
all the condensation.

25:33.233 --> 25:35.402
Our friends don't
like condensation.

25:37.338 --> 25:39.173
Hey, I know ma wants
us to work together,

25:40.341 --> 25:42.276
so as long as you
listen to me...

25:42.309 --> 25:43.309
Fuck!

25:44.311 --> 25:45.346
Damn it.

25:58.559 --> 25:59.560
Hey babe.

25:59.593 --> 26:01.195
Sup baby.

26:01.228 --> 26:02.529
What's going on?

26:03.697 --> 26:06.033
So can you tell
me why she's here?

26:08.268 --> 26:10.003
I just needed some help.

26:10.037 --> 26:11.038
She needs the money.

26:13.941 --> 26:15.409
Ma says she wants
her here anyway.

26:16.677 --> 26:17.677
Really?

26:19.346 --> 26:21.582
You see, this is
exactly what I mean.

26:21.615 --> 26:23.417
Fuck you talking about, huh?

26:23.450 --> 26:25.352
You know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

26:27.254 --> 26:28.322
You should be a man.

26:30.591 --> 26:32.359
Well you should
shut the fuck up.

26:34.995 --> 26:37.598
I ain't got time for this
bullshit today, all right?

26:39.233 --> 26:40.534
This ain't fucking bullshit.

26:45.005 --> 26:47.341
Fuck you!

26:48.342 --> 26:50.077
The fuck you looking
at, ding dong?

26:50.110 --> 26:51.110
Huh?

27:07.327 --> 27:09.129
Golden taxi, yeah.

27:11.131 --> 27:12.566
Yeah, getting better?

27:12.599 --> 27:14.067
Good, good.

27:14.101 --> 27:15.569
Where do you need to go?

27:15.602 --> 27:17.404
All right, no problem.

27:17.438 --> 27:18.705
Five minutes?

27:18.739 --> 27:20.207
Yeah.

27:22.476 --> 27:23.476
Let's go.

27:25.012 --> 27:26.980
Are you not gonna get that?

27:27.014 --> 27:28.715
I like to hear it ring.

27:28.749 --> 27:30.317
It's the sound of making money.

27:37.357 --> 27:38.659
People love dai mah.

27:38.692 --> 27:41.094
For a price, she brought
their family here.

27:42.329 --> 27:43.430
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:43.464 --> 27:45.432
Oh, oh, ah.

27:51.205 --> 27:53.373
But dai mah loved
money more than people.

27:55.309 --> 27:57.144
Everyone knew where she was,

27:57.177 --> 28:00.080
because all roads through
Chinatown flow through dai mah.

28:19.233 --> 28:20.334
Everyone knows you.

28:21.735 --> 28:23.136
Yeah.

28:23.170 --> 28:25.339
They know me and
they know my family.

28:25.372 --> 28:26.372
They trust me.

28:27.608 --> 28:29.676
They're afraid of you and Rambo.

28:29.710 --> 28:31.345
Afraid?

28:31.378 --> 28:34.114
There's a difference
between fear and respect.

28:35.215 --> 28:36.383
Everybody loves Rambo.

28:38.318 --> 28:39.318
Whatever you say.

28:44.291 --> 28:47.628
You know your firstborn
is always special.

28:49.864 --> 28:51.598
I love all my sons, but

28:53.333 --> 28:55.369
when Rambo was a little
boy, he saved me.

28:57.204 --> 28:58.238
What'd he do?

29:00.407 --> 29:03.310
I was weak, he was strong.

29:06.313 --> 29:07.815
Went to jail when he was 12.

29:10.784 --> 29:12.820
He's spent more than
half his life there.

29:14.388 --> 29:18.225
What Rambo is
today, I'm to blame.

29:22.663 --> 29:25.332
You know what it's
like to be a mother.

29:28.201 --> 29:32.439
You see your faults
in your children.

29:32.472 --> 29:34.441
You just wish you
had done better.

30:06.273 --> 30:08.308
She really likes you.

30:11.778 --> 30:14.481
You think you're
special, don't you, hm?

30:15.415 --> 30:16.416
You're not.

30:17.451 --> 30:18.685
I need to get back.

30:18.719 --> 30:20.320
Your mother hates
it when I'm late.

30:21.455 --> 30:24.758
You're just my mom's little
errand rat, you understand?

30:24.791 --> 30:25.791
Huh?

30:37.571 --> 30:39.439
Told ma she's too easy on you.

30:41.208 --> 30:42.409
Lucky I'm not in charge yet.

31:32.492 --> 31:33.492
Ready?

31:34.227 --> 31:36.263
If I wanted to clear my debt,

31:36.296 --> 31:38.632
I had to find a
place in her family.

31:38.665 --> 31:40.400
They each get one.

31:41.768 --> 31:43.537
What's she doing here?

31:43.570 --> 31:46.239
She's gonna
deliver the food from now on.

31:46.273 --> 31:47.273
Trust her?

31:48.742 --> 31:50.020
All right, all right, ma, sorry.

31:50.044 --> 31:51.913
I got it, I got it.

31:51.946 --> 31:53.246
I got it, ma.

31:54.681 --> 31:56.349
There were three safe houses.

31:56.383 --> 31:59.553
Each one had 10 to 20
migrants awaiting release.

32:00.721 --> 32:03.891
When a friend or relative
came to pay, they were free.

32:09.696 --> 32:12.299
There was always a lot of
cash at eldridge house.

32:16.336 --> 32:18.605
The black arowanas are a
little bit more aggressive

32:18.638 --> 32:21.708
than the silver ones
because they like the ph

32:21.742 --> 32:23.310
more on the acidic side.

32:23.343 --> 32:26.346
But if you put some peat
moss in the filter...

32:43.563 --> 32:46.433
I got some cousins in
Philly that might like you.

32:50.004 --> 32:51.004
Hey.

32:59.479 --> 33:00.982
I've seen how you stare.

33:02.817 --> 33:03.985
Seen it all my life.

33:05.452 --> 33:06.720
You think I'm weak, don't you?

33:11.893 --> 33:13.593
You survive your way,

33:15.863 --> 33:17.031
and I survive mine.

33:18.698 --> 33:21.368
In the end, it's all the same.

34:17.123 --> 34:18.725
Hey big bro.

34:18.757 --> 34:19.927
Where my slice at?

35:03.937 --> 35:04.438
Please...

35:04.738 --> 35:05.739
Can I have a coke?

35:06.773 --> 35:07.773
You want one?

35:09.043 --> 35:10.477
- Two.
- Three.

35:10.510 --> 35:12.702
No, you get a diet coke.

35:12.738 --> 35:13.739
Fat boy.

35:14.614 --> 35:15.649
I hate diet coke.

35:15.682 --> 35:19.053
Hey, I lost two girls
to fathead in Los Angeles.

35:19.086 --> 35:20.720
Think I can get
another shipment soon?

35:20.754 --> 35:22.890
Don't worry about it,
we'll take care of it.

35:22.924 --> 35:26.961
You know I can't earn
if I ain't got no product.

35:28.062 --> 35:29.729
- Piece of shit.
- Hey.

35:29.763 --> 35:31.665
When we eat, we eat in peace.

35:31.698 --> 35:34.035
Tse-jia, what you
doing this weekend?

35:35.836 --> 35:37.838
- Are you serious?
- What?

35:39.556 --> 35:41.266
You would crush her, fat boy.

35:43.010 --> 35:44.010
Ma.

35:53.287 --> 35:54.287
Go ahead.

35:57.291 --> 35:58.291
You earned it.

36:08.803 --> 36:10.137
Smoking in my restaurant?

36:10.171 --> 36:11.538
Nah.

36:34.594 --> 36:35.594
Yo Jack!

36:37.131 --> 36:38.665
Who are we meeting here?

36:38.698 --> 36:41.035
Hey, your place is not to ask,

36:41.068 --> 36:43.703
your place is to follow, okay?

36:48.142 --> 36:51.778
Dai mah was so rich
that Rambo never had to work,

36:51.812 --> 36:54.148
but he was a man, and
after 20 years in jail,

36:54.181 --> 36:55.782
he still had to prove it.

36:59.987 --> 37:01.155
My man Rambo.

37:02.223 --> 37:03.858
- And you are?
- Oh, she's the help,

37:03.891 --> 37:05.725
don't fuck with her.

37:05.759 --> 37:06.894
We good?

37:06.927 --> 37:09.063
Got that red arowana special.

37:10.264 --> 37:12.333
That's what I'm talking about.

37:12.366 --> 37:13.600
What do you say, huh?

37:15.870 --> 37:16.870
You up?

37:23.944 --> 37:25.188
All right, every
three to four weeks

37:25.212 --> 37:27.348
you're gonna pick up
20 cases from Jack.

37:27.381 --> 37:30.117
Five boxes go to the
safe house on eldridge,

37:30.151 --> 37:32.619
three in flushing, and
the rest to Richie.

37:32.652 --> 37:33.652
It's easy money.

37:35.222 --> 37:36.756
Hey, where you going?

37:36.790 --> 37:38.325
You better get one
of those boxes!

37:41.228 --> 37:43.797
Am I gonna have some
problem with you?

37:43.831 --> 37:45.698
This is stupid,
I'm not doing that.

37:47.168 --> 37:48.701
I'm not gonna smuggle drugs.

37:50.805 --> 37:52.306
The people are better, hm?

37:53.407 --> 37:55.810
At least I give people hope.

37:55.843 --> 37:57.178
You kill them.

38:28.675 --> 38:31.879
When I clear my debt,
I will go to her.

38:35.916 --> 38:39.086
But it felt like
I'd never get there.

38:48.262 --> 38:51.798
Even though I was close,
I was nothing to her.

39:15.956 --> 39:17.657
Zareeb, forgot the rice.

39:18.791 --> 39:20.161
Can you get it?

39:20.194 --> 39:21.228
Thanks.

39:33.790 --> 39:35.751
Can you help me?

39:35.792 --> 39:37.312
I need to get in touch with my cousin.

39:38.003 --> 39:39.171
Do they have the money?

39:39.213 --> 39:41.548
They are trying to get the loan.

39:41.590 --> 39:42.966
Here. Call now.

39:43.008 --> 39:44.009
Thank you.

39:51.192 --> 39:52.092
- They shot Jin.
- Who?

39:52.126 --> 39:53.227
- Get the guns!
- Who?

40:15.015 --> 40:18.819
You survive your
way, and I survive mine.

40:19.954 --> 40:22.056
In the end, it's all the same.

40:23.524 --> 40:25.226
Hurry the fuck up,
go to the other room!

40:25.259 --> 40:26.961
Hurry up, hurry the fuck up!

40:27.995 --> 40:28.995
Hurry up!

40:30.164 --> 40:30.998
Where's the money at?

40:31.031 --> 40:33.133
Where the fucking money at?

40:33.167 --> 40:34.835
Where's the fucking money?

41:22.583 --> 41:23.951
You okay?

41:25.286 --> 41:26.286
I'm okay.

41:37.998 --> 41:39.166
How?

41:40.868 --> 41:41.868
Too loud.

42:10.431 --> 42:11.431
Chopsticks.

42:19.306 --> 42:20.307
Mm, watch.

43:10.357 --> 43:11.358
Get rid of it.

43:13.193 --> 43:14.628
B.b.'s dead.

43:14.661 --> 43:15.864
He was in the next run.

43:15.896 --> 43:19.333
We need another
snakehead for the Taiwan job.

43:21.001 --> 43:22.001
I'll go.

43:25.639 --> 43:26.639
You're crazy.

43:28.475 --> 43:30.344
Why do you wanna go?

43:30.377 --> 43:33.247
Do you think I want to
fold dumplings forever?

43:33.280 --> 43:35.349
I've done it once,
I can do it again.

43:40.287 --> 43:41.622
Ma, she's not family.

43:54.201 --> 43:56.403
If I go, she'll
cut my debt in half.

43:58.205 --> 44:00.140
You know they don't
really care about you.

44:00.174 --> 44:01.575
To them you're just like a cook.

44:01.608 --> 44:04.311
You cook bad, they'll hire
somebody else to do it.

44:05.746 --> 44:08.348
If you know a fast way
how to make money, show me.

44:09.616 --> 44:11.718
But is it worth the risk?

44:11.752 --> 44:14.321
Every day we're
here, we're at risk.

44:14.354 --> 44:17.057
We could go to jail,
we could get deported.

44:17.090 --> 44:19.626
We could get killed
and no one would know.

44:19.660 --> 44:22.296
So you tell me, is
it worth the risk?

46:30.223 --> 46:31.223
Hey.

46:32.726 --> 46:34.829
So you are the
snakehead from New York.

46:47.015 --> 46:48.225
Where's my cargo?

46:50.435 --> 46:51.603
What's the rush?

46:51.645 --> 46:53.188
You are a long way from home.

46:53.230 --> 46:54.439
Have a drink.

46:56.859 --> 46:58.986
I'm here to do a job.

46:59.027 --> 47:03.991
I miss New York. How's
dai mah? Paigwut?

47:04.032 --> 47:06.201
Is Rambo out of jail yet?

47:06.243 --> 47:08.954
He must be all grown up.

47:10.455 --> 47:15.043
There's a typhoon coming
and we need to leave.

47:15.878 --> 47:17.087
Where are my people?

47:37.691 --> 47:40.068
They all paid and are ready to go.

47:41.069 --> 47:42.863
Hey! When are we leaving?

47:42.905 --> 47:44.865
We've been here for over three months!

47:44.907 --> 47:45.907
Shut up!

47:47.075 --> 47:48.035
Why do you talk so much?

47:48.076 --> 47:49.494
Whatever I tell you
to do, you do.

47:52.080 --> 47:55.042
The ports will shut down
the ports tomorrow.

47:55.083 --> 47:57.003
You can't afford to keep them
here another month.

47:58.921 --> 48:00.130
Don't you think I know that?

48:03.091 --> 48:04.676
No. We leave tonight.

48:04.718 --> 48:05.719
How?

48:09.097 --> 48:11.058
If you follow me, I will
deliver you safe.

48:33.747 --> 48:38.544
From here, we take a container boat
from taishan to Guatemala.

48:40.128 --> 48:43.757
There, a coyote will smuggle
us north to america.

48:46.927 --> 48:51.932
Watch out for cartel and militia.
They own the border.

49:32.874 --> 49:34.674
Is that border patrol?

49:34.708 --> 49:37.410
I don't know, but
it's time to run.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.415
- Vamanos!
- Come on!

49:42.449 --> 49:43.449
Come on!

49:45.052 --> 49:47.955
Eagle one here, I've
located about 20 illegals.

49:47.989 --> 49:49.924
They see the drone
and heading north.

49:49.957 --> 49:51.691
Can you handle them at
the river, scorpion?

49:51.725 --> 49:53.828
In my vehicle,
you can just guide me in.

49:53.861 --> 49:55.629
Look at them
all scatter like ants.

50:07.842 --> 50:10.077
Looks like they close
the doors into an old barn.

50:10.111 --> 50:12.312
Copy that, eta five minutes.

50:19.120 --> 50:20.487
Is this illegal shit?

50:21.155 --> 50:22.155
Money.

50:30.932 --> 50:32.834
Time to go.

50:36.469 --> 50:38.605
Group is
moving, group is moving.

50:44.678 --> 50:45.779
Go, go, go!

50:45.813 --> 50:46.981
I see it to the right!

50:48.715 --> 50:50.483
Watch right there, go!

50:50.517 --> 50:51.919
Go faster!

50:51.953 --> 50:53.353
I see them, I see them.

50:59.927 --> 51:01.361
It's militia.

51:04.932 --> 51:06.466
They're gonna hit the riverbed.

51:10.204 --> 51:11.638
We gonna get them this time.

51:11.671 --> 51:13.773
Patriots defense recon, go!

51:13.808 --> 51:14.876
Drone needs charge.

51:17.611 --> 51:20.780
Copy that, scorpion
engaging target.

51:21.816 --> 51:22.917
Easy, hands up.

51:22.950 --> 51:24.085
Get your fucking hands up.

51:25.485 --> 51:26.954
What is this?

51:26.988 --> 51:29.190
Fucking chink and a wetback?

51:29.223 --> 51:31.691
This some kind of
United Nations bullshit?

51:31.725 --> 51:33.828
We are Christian.

51:33.861 --> 51:35.438
Doesn't fucking matter,
get on the ground.

51:35.462 --> 51:37.064
Get on the fucking grown now!

51:37.098 --> 51:38.132
All the way!

51:39.666 --> 51:41.468
Open the fucking door.

51:41.501 --> 51:42.702
You fucking open the...

51:43.737 --> 51:45.538
Don't you talk back, head down.

51:45.572 --> 51:48.541
Head down, don't look at me.

51:56.516 --> 51:57.517
Where's everyone?

51:58.585 --> 52:00.487
Where the fuck is everyone else?

52:00.520 --> 52:01.655
They went back.

52:03.490 --> 52:04.859
Scorpion, do you copy?

52:04.892 --> 52:05.960
We got nothing here.

52:07.094 --> 52:08.461
There's no one else.

52:17.171 --> 52:18.538
Scorpion.

52:21.175 --> 52:22.255
What's going on down there?

53:35.016 --> 53:36.549
Why did you come here?

53:48.695 --> 53:50.231
Ah, family.

53:53.633 --> 53:55.735
They never talk about family.

54:01.175 --> 54:02.709
I don't have family.

54:08.282 --> 54:10.284
You always have family.

54:47.600 --> 54:48.600
Sister tse.

54:49.689 --> 54:50.690
Hold on again.

54:51.791 --> 54:53.094
Hello?

54:53.127 --> 54:55.329
Oh, zareeb, I think
it's your cousin.

54:56.831 --> 54:57.832
Hello?

54:58.298 --> 54:59.925
Amir, it's you! How are you doing?

55:01.510 --> 55:05.514
Thank god, thank god!
God is great! Wonderful!

55:06.139 --> 55:07.766
Thank you very much! Thank you!

55:08.308 --> 55:12.729
She got the visa! She is finally coming!
Tse, she is coming!

55:12.947 --> 55:14.381
I'm happy for you.

55:14.415 --> 55:15.648
Yeah!

55:17.451 --> 55:18.618
Come.

55:22.948 --> 55:26.285
Sister tse, I know this
payment isn't enough.

55:26.326 --> 55:27.536
My daughter's been sick.

55:27.953 --> 55:29.705
I promise I won't run.

55:29.746 --> 55:30.956
Can you give me more time?

55:32.799 --> 55:34.801
Pay when you can,
you're not going anywhere.

55:35.961 --> 55:37.963
Thank you, sister tse.
Thank you! Thank you!

55:42.968 --> 55:44.720
Do you like lobsters?

55:44.761 --> 55:46.513
Come to my place.
I'll take care of you.

55:46.555 --> 55:47.556
Thank you.

56:04.031 --> 56:05.166
No, why?

56:05.199 --> 56:07.368
They wanna
know how you're doing there.

56:07.401 --> 56:09.736
I don't wanna be on it.

56:09.769 --> 56:11.348
Then I told them just
because we live in Chinatown

56:11.372 --> 56:13.440
doesn't mean we
should burn our trash.

56:13.474 --> 56:15.876
Stop being such a gentrifier.

56:15.910 --> 56:18.412
Yeah, stop being a gentrifier.

56:23.417 --> 56:25.386
They wanna talk to Rosie too.

56:25.419 --> 56:27.321
It'll be good exposure
for my clients.

56:28.822 --> 56:31.025
Oh shoot, I forgot the brie.

56:31.058 --> 56:32.226
Gotta go back.

56:59.628 --> 57:03.590
Sister tse! Lots of lobsters!

57:03.632 --> 57:05.634
Come up! Come up!

57:11.473 --> 57:13.308
Sister tse! Sister tse!

57:14.059 --> 57:16.937
Here's a large box of lobsters for you.

57:17.855 --> 57:20.065
Also, these guys I trust.

57:20.858 --> 57:23.944
If you need help with anything,
don't be afraid to ask.

57:25.279 --> 57:26.280
Thank you.

57:31.318 --> 57:32.318
Hey, hey!

57:36.665 --> 57:39.251
You work for dai mah, right?

57:40.294 --> 57:44.673
I need help getting my wife
and daughter here.

57:45.674 --> 57:47.259
You should talk to dai mah.

57:47.301 --> 57:49.636
I don't trust dai mah.

57:49.678 --> 57:52.556
People are just cargo to her.

57:55.309 --> 57:57.728
This is my wife and child.

58:01.106 --> 58:04.568
I can help you, but dai mah can't know.

58:05.694 --> 58:06.695
Thank you.

58:16.630 --> 58:19.133
Hey yo, let
me ask you a question.

58:19.166 --> 58:20.166
Sup, Bo?

58:24.338 --> 58:26.273
What do you
think about sister tse?

58:30.978 --> 58:33.047
Uh, I don't know.

58:33.080 --> 58:34.080
She's cool.

58:36.617 --> 58:38.619
Why, you like her?

58:38.652 --> 58:39.553
Nah.

58:39.586 --> 58:42.156
I want you to follow her.

58:42.189 --> 58:43.189
Oh.

58:44.191 --> 58:45.192
Okay, I got you.

58:49.196 --> 58:50.397
Does ma know about this?

58:53.267 --> 58:55.269
Get the fuck out
and get the girls.

58:55.302 --> 58:56.537
Get the fuck out of here!

58:59.940 --> 59:00.940
Come on.

59:01.642 --> 59:03.510
Hold on, hold
on, hold on, hold on.

59:03.544 --> 59:05.012
Where you taking them?

59:05.045 --> 59:07.114
You got your
money, you did your job.

59:07.147 --> 59:08.015
You're done here.

59:08.048 --> 59:10.184
You, you, you, come
on, come with me.

59:11.385 --> 59:12.385
Move!

59:36.043 --> 59:38.112
Hey, what the fuck...

59:38.145 --> 59:39.880
Got a problem?

59:45.252 --> 59:47.588
Hey ma, ma!

59:47.621 --> 59:49.289
How come you're not
picking up your phone?

59:55.262 --> 59:56.539
Ma, you know what
this bitch is doing?

59:56.563 --> 59:58.003
You talking about
the massage parlor?

59:58.031 --> 59:59.299
Hey, something funny, huh?

01:00:00.734 --> 01:00:02.236
She's fucking with my money, ma.

01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:03.036
Calm down.

01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:04.338
Hey, you think you're in charge?

01:00:06.006 --> 01:00:07.641
I said do you think
you're in charge?

01:00:11.445 --> 01:00:14.281
Ma, I'm gonna kill
this bitch right here.

01:00:18.285 --> 01:00:19.987
- Fuck...
- Hey, you!

01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.020
Out.

01:01:09.336 --> 01:01:10.637
God, I fucking hate you.

01:01:56.617 --> 01:01:58.752
I'm worried about Rambo.

01:02:04.191 --> 01:02:06.560
I've got a nephew in Toronto

01:02:06.593 --> 01:02:10.030
that wants to smuggle
through Belize.

01:02:12.332 --> 01:02:13.433
These aren't Chinese.

01:02:14.836 --> 01:02:16.136
Who are they?

01:02:16.871 --> 01:02:17.871
Refugees.

01:02:19.373 --> 01:02:21.675
Another country, higher
risk, more money.

01:02:24.778 --> 01:02:26.313
I want you to do it.

01:02:31.718 --> 01:02:32.718
I don't think so.

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:42.329
I need to make sure
nothing goes wrong.

01:02:45.365 --> 01:02:46.667
To make sure Rambo's okay.

01:02:56.410 --> 01:02:57.578
I want you to do it.

01:02:59.179 --> 01:03:01.148
It'll be good for both of you.

01:03:03.617 --> 01:03:04.617
The family.

01:03:18.599 --> 01:03:19.599
Do it for me.

01:03:27.641 --> 01:03:29.309
I'll clear your debt.

01:03:48.930 --> 01:03:50.397
So I've been following tse-jia

01:03:50.430 --> 01:03:51.899
like you told me to.

01:03:51.933 --> 01:03:53.467
She keeps going to this church.

01:03:54.701 --> 01:03:56.470
What's she doing there?

01:03:56.503 --> 01:03:57.503
I'm not sure.

01:03:59.339 --> 01:04:00.339
Just keep following her.

01:04:02.275 --> 01:04:03.644
Hey ding dong!

01:04:03.677 --> 01:04:04.677
Come here.

01:04:09.216 --> 01:04:10.250
What do you want?

01:04:12.854 --> 01:04:13.854
Why are you here?

01:04:15.522 --> 01:04:17.224
We don't need your help.

01:04:17.257 --> 01:04:18.759
I'm only here
because of your mom.

01:04:30.972 --> 01:04:32.907
How did it get over the border?

01:04:32.940 --> 01:04:35.242
White sting hauler can
go anywhere you want.

01:04:40.247 --> 01:04:41.324
I'll go check on them first.

01:04:41.348 --> 01:04:43.784
What? No, no, no, we don't
got time for that shit.

01:04:43.818 --> 01:04:44.995
We gotta drive all
night, let's go.

01:04:45.019 --> 01:04:46.653
You have no idea what it's like

01:04:46.687 --> 01:04:48.388
to be in a shipping container.

01:04:49.857 --> 01:04:51.291
Maybe we could
just go check, Bo.

01:04:51.324 --> 01:04:53.293
Maybe they gotta
pee or something.

01:04:56.530 --> 01:04:57.530
Bullshit.

01:05:05.639 --> 01:05:06.941
Fuck!

01:05:06.974 --> 01:05:08.341
What?

01:05:09.276 --> 01:05:11.012
Oh shit, yo, Bo!

01:05:11.045 --> 01:05:12.779
Bo, you gotta come
over here, Bo!

01:05:12.814 --> 01:05:14.681
What is wrong with you?

01:05:14.715 --> 01:05:15.850
Come on, Bo, you got,

01:05:15.883 --> 01:05:17.617
please just come over here!

01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:20.420
What is it, some bullshit?

01:05:20.454 --> 01:05:22.622
Oh shit.

01:05:23.958 --> 01:05:25.692
Oh shit, oh fuck.

01:05:28.830 --> 01:05:29.830
Shit, shit.

01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.903
Get the fuck up here!

01:05:35.937 --> 01:05:38.039
Come on, man, I can't.

01:05:38.072 --> 01:05:40.340
Get the fuck in here now!

01:06:01.361 --> 01:06:02.496
Hey, help me with this one.

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:04.531
I can't, bro, I can't.

01:06:04.564 --> 01:06:05.742
Look at all the fucking
dead bodies, Bo.

01:06:05.766 --> 01:06:06.910
Man, get the fuck out of here!

01:06:06.934 --> 01:06:07.934
You come here.

01:06:12.339 --> 01:06:13.373
Move this one.

01:06:20.614 --> 01:06:22.083
Bingo.

01:06:22.116 --> 01:06:24.518
There's 50 more kilos in here,
we'll find them in New York.

01:06:25.786 --> 01:06:27.354
Bro, somebody
left the freezer on.

01:06:27.387 --> 01:06:29.957
Hey, we stick to the plan
and we drive back tonight.

01:06:29.991 --> 01:06:31.058
How we gonna drive back

01:06:31.092 --> 01:06:32.532
with all these things
back here, bro?

01:06:37.064 --> 01:06:38.498
Fuck!

01:06:38.532 --> 01:06:41.002
Every single fucking
time because of you.

01:06:41.035 --> 01:06:42.904
Get your fucking
drugs, let's go.

01:06:42.937 --> 01:06:45.472
They showed up like this.
This ain't my fucking fault.

01:06:46.439 --> 01:06:47.440
Yeah it is.

01:06:50.610 --> 01:06:52.079
You gonna fucking stand there?

01:06:52.113 --> 01:06:53.113
Let's go!

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400
Hey.

01:07:18.072 --> 01:07:19.439
It's your cut.

01:07:29.783 --> 01:07:32.053
38 bodies were found frozen dead

01:07:32.086 --> 01:07:34.554
in an abandoned
refrigerated smuggling truck

01:07:34.588 --> 01:07:36.123
in queens today.

01:07:36.157 --> 01:07:38.159
Authorities have not
determined the origin

01:07:38.192 --> 01:07:40.560
of the immigrants,
but the DEA suspects

01:07:40.594 --> 01:07:41.996
narcotics to be involved.

01:07:42.029 --> 01:07:44.098
The truck originated
from Toronto, Canada,

01:07:44.131 --> 01:07:46.533
and normally transports
frozen lobsters

01:07:46.566 --> 01:07:48.970
for uncle Beth's seafood
company in Chinatown.

01:07:49.904 --> 01:07:51.906
The suspects are still at large.

01:08:10.724 --> 01:08:11.826
All my debts are paid.

01:08:13.127 --> 01:08:14.694
I can't work for you anymore.

01:08:16.898 --> 01:08:18.398
You know you're special.

01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:26.573
Look, I didn't work this hard
for Rambo to fuck it all up.

01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:29.911
You saved me a fortune.

01:08:30.810 --> 01:08:32.746
I didn't do that for you.

01:08:32.779 --> 01:08:33.881
I did that to survive.

01:08:33.915 --> 01:08:34.915
I respect that.

01:08:37.051 --> 01:08:39.519
What if I can offer
you something better?

01:08:41.188 --> 01:08:42.622
I'll double your pay.

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:48.062
And give you the dumpling house.

01:08:54.135 --> 01:08:55.135
People depend on me.

01:08:57.671 --> 01:08:59.840
When I'm gone, people
can depend on you.

01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:26.078
Sister tse, I'm worried about my family.

01:11:26.119 --> 01:11:32.084
Last I heard they were in Montreal.

01:11:32.125 --> 01:11:34.628
Don't worry. The Van will come soon.

01:11:35.128 --> 01:11:36.463
Thank you.

01:11:36.505 --> 01:11:40.467
Dai mah doesn't know about this.
Let's keep it that way.

01:11:40.509 --> 01:11:41.510
No problem.

01:11:45.239 --> 01:11:46.606
Hey, come on.

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.995
What's going on here?

01:12:08.028 --> 01:12:09.039
They just traveled 8,000 miles

01:12:09.063 --> 01:12:10.140
and you're gonna
bring them here?

01:12:10.164 --> 01:12:11.932
The fuck is wrong with you?

01:12:24.311 --> 01:12:26.746
- I wanna ask you...
- No English.

01:12:28.349 --> 01:12:30.117
Mei-ying tse?

01:12:30.151 --> 01:12:31.185
That is your name, right?

01:12:32.386 --> 01:12:35.156
I wanna ask you
about a snakehead.

01:12:35.189 --> 01:12:36.723
Pearl ho.

01:12:36.756 --> 01:12:38.292
Also known as dai mah.

01:12:41.262 --> 01:12:45.266
It turns out your fingerprints
are all over the truck.

01:12:46.967 --> 01:12:49.303
You're gonna tell me all
about the frozen bodies.

01:12:51.138 --> 01:12:55.409
Or we can talk
about your daughter.

01:13:04.518 --> 01:13:08.189
Is your survival more
important than hers?

01:13:30.878 --> 01:13:31.879
All right then.

01:13:35.049 --> 01:13:39.153
Sister tse, let's start
from the beginning.

01:13:44.158 --> 01:13:48.761
When I was three, my
mother sold me for $1,000.

01:13:49.964 --> 01:13:50.965
I never blamed her.

01:13:51.932 --> 01:13:52.932
What could she do?

01:13:54.068 --> 01:13:56.203
How could anyone
blame a prostitute?

01:13:58.205 --> 01:14:00.507
I grew up hard
learning one thing.

01:14:00.541 --> 01:14:01.741
Survival.

01:14:05.012 --> 01:14:06.380
My name is tse Mei-ying.

01:14:07.348 --> 01:14:09.283
But people call me sister tse.

01:14:13.053 --> 01:14:14.955
I never believed in
the American dream.

01:14:16.023 --> 01:14:17.825
All I knew was how to survive.

01:14:20.261 --> 01:14:21.962
For me and my family.

01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:28.869
Thank you, dai mah.

01:14:28.902 --> 01:14:29.970
We protect our own.

01:14:31.972 --> 01:14:34.908
Sorry we didn't get to you
earlier. These things take time.

01:14:50.624 --> 01:14:52.559
You've nothing to worry about.

01:14:52.593 --> 01:14:53.861
We're family.

01:15:06.307 --> 01:15:08.042
Come on, I gotta
show you something.

01:15:08.075 --> 01:15:09.510
All right, this better be good.

01:15:11.345 --> 01:15:13.113
There you go.

01:15:13.147 --> 01:15:14.147
Wait.

01:15:16.216 --> 01:15:17.051
Me?

01:15:17.084 --> 01:15:18.285
It's all yours.

01:15:22.956 --> 01:15:24.892
Oh, tse, you're amazing.

01:15:25.893 --> 01:15:26.893
Wow.

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:31.230
What?

01:15:34.134 --> 01:15:36.070
You know I worry
about you sometimes.

01:15:37.504 --> 01:15:38.972
What's there to worry about?

01:15:41.408 --> 01:15:43.377
You have more than enough money.

01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:45.045
Why are you still doing this?

01:15:49.416 --> 01:15:50.416
Enjoy this, okay?

01:15:58.359 --> 01:16:00.361
Did you hear what
sister tse did?

01:16:00.394 --> 01:16:01.995
She started
smuggling on the side

01:16:02.029 --> 01:16:04.164
and got caught by
the FBI, dumb bitch.

01:16:05.265 --> 01:16:07.568
You want me to kill tse-jia?

01:16:07.601 --> 01:16:09.470
No, I need some leverage.

01:16:10.604 --> 01:16:12.639
Get me that little
girl she's been seeing.

01:16:13.974 --> 01:16:15.409
You want me to
kill the little girl?

01:16:15.442 --> 01:16:16.243
No!

01:16:16.276 --> 01:16:17.344
Just bring her to me.

01:18:05.219 --> 01:18:06.253
Hello?

01:18:07.354 --> 01:18:08.789
Anybody home?

01:18:08.823 --> 01:18:09.990
Hello!

01:18:19.166 --> 01:18:20.166
Sup?

01:18:21.101 --> 01:18:22.101
Nice place.

01:18:23.170 --> 01:18:24.170
Bo know about this?

01:18:25.339 --> 01:18:26.740
You might need a new job soon.

01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:29.543
Work for you?

01:18:30.344 --> 01:18:31.612
Huh?

01:18:31.645 --> 01:18:33.313
Are you fucking crazy?

01:18:35.349 --> 01:18:37.384
You seem to be
forgetting your place.

01:18:40.287 --> 01:18:41.688
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:18:43.557 --> 01:18:45.158
Oh.

01:18:45.192 --> 01:18:47.628
You motherfuckers
wanna play, huh?

01:18:47.661 --> 01:18:49.263
You motherfuckers wanna play?

01:18:51.431 --> 01:18:53.233
Bring it, bring
it, motherfuckers!

01:18:53.267 --> 01:18:54.267
Huh?

01:18:55.235 --> 01:18:56.570
I'm gonna fucking enjoy this.

01:18:57.872 --> 01:19:00.173
That little fucking bitch
Rosie, she's fucking next!

01:19:22.195 --> 01:19:23.430
Do it, do it!

01:22:34.654 --> 01:22:37.290
I gave you everything and
treated you like a daughter

01:22:37.324 --> 01:22:38.358
from the beginning.

01:22:41.561 --> 01:22:44.798
You mean a life of
slavery and violence?

01:22:44.832 --> 01:22:47.034
Or all your bullshit
about family and loyalty?

01:22:47.068 --> 01:22:48.668
Ungrateful prostitute.

01:22:50.071 --> 01:22:53.040
You wanna know why
I am like I am?

01:22:53.074 --> 01:22:54.809
Because I have to be.

01:22:56.010 --> 01:22:58.411
That's what makes america work.

01:22:58.445 --> 01:23:00.413
You lied and cheat
your own people.

01:23:03.450 --> 01:23:05.685
I didn't force you to do shit.

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:09.389
You cheated those
migrants just like me.

01:23:10.124 --> 01:23:11.691
I'll never be like you.

01:23:12.592 --> 01:23:15.395
We're the same, and the why?

01:23:15.428 --> 01:23:16.428
Guilt.

01:23:17.764 --> 01:23:20.034
It eats your heart
out from the inside.

01:23:22.003 --> 01:23:24.071
It takes a lot to
give up a child

01:23:26.073 --> 01:23:27.574
for your own survival.

01:23:30.845 --> 01:23:33.647
Like I said before,
the past is the past.

01:23:35.749 --> 01:23:38.085
We make our own fate here.

01:23:42.089 --> 01:23:44.524
Shooting me does you nothing.

01:23:46.626 --> 01:23:48.562
When I'm dead, the money's gone.

01:23:52.499 --> 01:23:54.035
Or you could have it all.

01:23:56.871 --> 01:23:58.940
I'll get your daughter back.

01:24:12.086 --> 01:24:14.721
What about the FBI,
the delivery truck?

01:24:17.024 --> 01:24:18.692
Rambo killed the gweilo driver

01:24:18.725 --> 01:24:20.995
and the flushing crew is gone.

01:24:21.028 --> 01:24:23.663
The only thing tying us
to frozen bodies is you.

01:24:27.068 --> 01:24:28.068
What about Rambo?

01:24:29.036 --> 01:24:31.738
Rambo's my son. He'll obey.

01:24:31.771 --> 01:24:33.440
But you have to
make up with him.

01:24:33.473 --> 01:24:35.442
He's still sour about pai gwut.

01:24:41.082 --> 01:24:44.051
You come to the
wedding, bring lobsters.

01:24:44.085 --> 01:24:46.386
My good son's finally
getting married.

01:25:19.854 --> 01:25:22.756
What about the
FBI, the delivery truck?

01:25:24.825 --> 01:25:26.459
Rambo killed the gweilo driver

01:25:26.493 --> 01:25:28.195
and the flushing crew is gone.

01:25:29.230 --> 01:25:31.698
The only thing tying us to
the frozen bodies is you.

01:25:48.515 --> 01:25:49.683
Leave Rosie alone.

01:25:52.585 --> 01:25:54.989
And why would I wanna
hurt a little girl, huh?

01:25:56.157 --> 01:25:57.490
Killing zareeb?

01:25:58.826 --> 01:26:00.828
Yeah, that was
payback for pai gwut.

01:26:03.931 --> 01:26:04.931
I get it.

01:26:08.635 --> 01:26:10.470
And you don't
answer to ma anymore.

01:26:12.106 --> 01:26:13.606
You're my pet now.

01:26:23.217 --> 01:26:24.784
Mom, come on up here!

01:26:26.187 --> 01:26:28.722
I just wanted everyone
to raise a glass

01:26:28.755 --> 01:26:31.658
to the woman who made me
the man that I am today.

01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:35.096
A woman who raised me
when we had nothing.

01:26:39.166 --> 01:26:40.968
But killing zareeb?

01:26:41.002 --> 01:26:42.970
That was payback for pai gwut.

01:26:55.016 --> 01:26:56.017
Here's to you, mom.

01:27:17.204 --> 01:27:19.073
Where's Rambo?

01:27:19.106 --> 01:27:20.141
The fuck is this?

01:27:20.174 --> 01:27:21.541
I didn't do shit!

01:28:43.224 --> 01:28:45.658
I didn't come
for the American dream.

01:28:46.793 --> 01:28:47.793
I came for family.

01:29:04.278 --> 01:29:06.280
I left her once for my survival.

01:29:07.815 --> 01:29:11.085
This time, I leave her for hers.
