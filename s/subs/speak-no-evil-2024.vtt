(clears throat) Sorry.
This food is so rich.

09:36.403 --> 09:38.336
We're debating
toilet paper protocols.

09:38.471 --> 09:42.647
So, uh, to scrunch or to fold.
What do you do?

09:45.051 --> 09:47.151
Uh...

09:47.286 --> 09:48.217
I don't know.

09:48.353 --> 09:49.554
Oh, all right.

09:49.689 --> 09:51.217
Well, Louise is fold,
Ciara is scrunch,

09:51.352 --> 09:53.155
but, you see, Ben and I,
we worry that if you fold,

09:53.291 --> 09:55.759
you risk a puncture and you get
a bit of poo on your finger.

09:55.895 --> 09:58.992
So, what should we do,
get another three chairs?

09:59.128 --> 10:00.795
No, no, we were
actually just looking

10:00.931 --> 10:02.861
to make a reservation
for later, so...

10:02.997 --> 10:04.833
Oh, all right, man. Um, okay.

10:04.968 --> 10:07.268
Well, see you guys
back at the ranch.

10:07.403 --> 10:09.099
Yeah.

10:09.234 --> 10:11.671
-Bye, then. (mutters)
-Cheers.

10:11.807 --> 10:12.772
-(laughter)
-What?

10:12.907 --> 10:14.371
Paddy, you're terrible.

10:14.507 --> 10:16.477
-Terrible. -You do not know
the half of it.

10:16.613 --> 10:18.914
(laughter continues)

10:20.252 --> 10:21.383
(lively chatter)

10:21.519 --> 10:22.952
A hundred percent, sure.

10:23.088 --> 10:26.485
Was it last year or
the year before we went there?

10:26.620 --> 10:28.023
Oh, yeah.

10:28.158 --> 10:30.525
Oh, Torsten, you haven't said.
Fold or scrunch?

10:30.661 --> 10:31.960
-(laughter)
-Oh, man.

10:32.095 --> 10:33.494
I know. I'm really sor--
I'm really sorry.

10:33.630 --> 10:34.692
Anyway, sorry, mate.

10:34.827 --> 10:36.434
Here we go.

10:36.569 --> 10:40.665
GROUP:
<i> Tre, due, uno.</i>

10:40.800 --> 10:42.337
(cheering)

10:42.472 --> 10:45.339
(laughter)

10:46.108 --> 10:48.006
-PADDY: To new friends.
-(glasses clink)

10:48.141 --> 10:50.275
OTHERS:
To new friends.

10:54.685 --> 10:56.553
(siren wailing in distance)

10:56.688 --> 10:57.852
LOUISE:
(shrieks) Oh, God.

10:57.988 --> 10:59.083
Remind me why we live
in London again.

10:59.218 --> 11:01.819
Come on. Go inside. Let's go.

11:01.954 --> 11:03.420
(Louise groans)

11:15.274 --> 11:17.108
(sighs)

11:17.243 --> 11:18.374
All right.

11:18.509 --> 11:20.408
Good night, honey.

11:20.543 --> 11:22.142
And Hoppy.

11:25.078 --> 11:27.718
Hon, you remember our agreement?

11:27.854 --> 11:30.920
Hoppy gets his own room
before Christmas.

11:32.122 --> 11:35.254
Right?
You're almost 12 years old.

11:37.229 --> 11:38.690
Love you.

11:38.825 --> 11:40.864
I love you, too.

11:44.899 --> 11:46.633
(door opens, closes)

11:46.768 --> 11:50.636
I don't think Hoppy's getting
his own room before Christmas.

11:51.472 --> 11:53.710
I mean, Louise,
do you think we should worry

11:53.846 --> 11:55.906
-about why the...
-Ben, would you...

11:56.041 --> 11:58.145
She'll hear you.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.181
It's probably better
that she does.

12:04.753 --> 12:06.923
Are you okay?

12:07.992 --> 12:10.492
I got a call from
the headhunter today.

12:10.627 --> 12:12.524
I didn't get it.

12:12.660 --> 12:14.326
Oh.

12:15.599 --> 12:16.960
Honey, I'm sorry.

12:17.096 --> 12:18.565
(phone chimes, vibrates)

12:18.701 --> 12:20.398
(Louise sighs)

12:23.543 --> 12:24.875
-It's Penny.
-Mm.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.736
Agnes's math tutor.
You want to read it?

12:26.872 --> 12:28.108
No.

12:28.243 --> 12:30.441
-(sighs): Goddamn.
-(sets phone down)

12:33.486 --> 12:35.714
Uh, look who wrote us.

12:35.849 --> 12:38.053
Your friend.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.929
"Ciao, Ben and Louise.

12:45.064 --> 12:47.427
"We so miss our amazing week
together in Italy.

12:47.563 --> 12:51.035
"You really must come visit
the farm. What do you say?

12:51.171 --> 12:54.098
"A long weekend of Devon air,
fresh food and long walks.

12:54.233 --> 12:56.004
"Ant sends Agnes good vibes.

12:56.139 --> 12:57.835
-He really misses her."
-(chuckles)

12:57.970 --> 12:59.274
Very sweet.

12:59.410 --> 13:00.670
Hey.

13:01.306 --> 13:04.409
Maybe this will be good for her.

13:04.544 --> 13:08.050
Uh, for us.
You know, change of scenery.

13:08.782 --> 13:10.452
Yeah.

13:10.587 --> 13:14.422
It's maybe a bit long to spend
with people we barely know.

13:14.557 --> 13:15.789
Yeah.

13:15.925 --> 13:18.093
You're probably right.

13:19.365 --> 13:22.993
(sighs) Anyways.

13:23.262 --> 13:25.029
-(sighs)
-You know what?

13:25.164 --> 13:27.536
I think we should go.

13:27.805 --> 13:30.207
-Yeah?
-Yeah. Be fun.

13:30.342 --> 13:31.942
Yeah?

13:43.718 --> 13:45.450
Oh, gosh.

13:49.726 --> 13:51.923
Look at that.

13:52.059 --> 13:54.965
Yeah. Look at that.

13:58.868 --> 14:01.169
(tires rolling on gravel)

14:05.740 --> 14:07.708
BEN:<i> Are you sure</i>
<i> we didn't miss the turn or...</i>

14:07.843 --> 14:11.411
Well, I don't know. We haven't
seen the-the war memorial yet.

14:11.546 --> 14:14.853
-(sighs heavily)
-Ben, please don't get angry.

14:15.752 --> 14:17.955
I'm not angry.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.186
C-Can you call them
or-or ask or...

14:21.321 --> 14:25.127
There's still no... (sighs)

14:25.793 --> 14:26.695
Oh.

14:26.830 --> 14:28.631
<i> Oh. War memorial!</i>

14:28.767 --> 14:30.165
<i> Left. Left, left, left.</i>

14:34.233 --> 14:37.172
(night bird calling)

14:40.042 --> 14:42.545
-Baby.
-AGNES: Hmm?

14:42.680 --> 14:44.410
We're here.

14:57.057 --> 14:58.496
<i> (Ben sighs)</i>

14:58.632 --> 15:00.657
Get me out of this car.

15:01.601 --> 15:02.863
(Ben sighs heavily)

15:02.999 --> 15:04.062
-Hey! -Hey!
-Hey!

15:04.198 --> 15:05.769
-You made it.
-Hi.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.169
PADDY:
We thought you were lost.

15:07.304 --> 15:08.399
-Oh, no. -Ah. Well,
we thought we were lost.

15:08.534 --> 15:10.167
-No, we didn't.
-Oh, yeah?

15:10.302 --> 15:11.936
Good to see you, darling.

15:12.071 --> 15:14.743
-Come on. We'll get you in.
-BEN: This place is just so...

15:14.879 --> 15:16.773
Oh, wow. Oh, sorry, shoes.

15:16.908 --> 15:19.146
Oh, no, you can leave them on.
Don't worry.

15:19.282 --> 15:20.985
-Sorry for the mess. (laughs)
-Oh, no.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.983
-Shall we put your bag
in your room? -Yeah.

15:23.118 --> 15:25.216
-Wow.
-You like it?

15:25.351 --> 15:27.119
-Wow, this place.
-(laughs)

15:27.255 --> 15:28.918
Innit? Let me get you a drink.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.354
Ooh.

15:30.489 --> 15:32.825
-Very steep.
-Here we go.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.828
(gasps) Wow.

15:35.963 --> 15:37.029
Cozy. (chuckles)

15:37.165 --> 15:38.196
PADDY:
<i> Cider.</i>

15:38.332 --> 15:40.735
From our very own farm apples.

15:40.870 --> 15:43.040
-No.
-Yeah.

15:45.973 --> 15:47.778
(chuckling)

15:47.913 --> 15:49.073
That's the good stuff, right?

15:49.208 --> 15:50.608
-Strong.
-(laughs)

15:50.743 --> 15:52.376
Just you wait till
you try our calvados.

15:52.512 --> 15:55.481
-It's 150 proof.
-(bottles clink)

15:56.721 --> 15:57.983
CIARA:
Ant?

15:58.118 --> 16:00.222
It's Agnes.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.920
Oh. Say hi to Ant, sweetie.

16:04.056 --> 16:06.060
Hi, Ant.

16:06.195 --> 16:08.129
Oh, he's just a little shy.

16:08.265 --> 16:10.193
Look, Agnes,
we made you a little bed.

16:10.328 --> 16:12.335
Do you like it?

16:12.471 --> 16:13.834
Yes.

16:13.969 --> 16:15.200
It's great.

16:15.336 --> 16:17.041
Ant, it's time for dinner.

16:17.176 --> 16:19.637
-Come down when you're ready.
-Yeah.

16:24.346 --> 16:26.215
LOUISE:
Oh, and we got you this.

16:26.351 --> 16:28.347
CIARA: Oh, a candle.
You shouldn't have.

16:28.482 --> 16:29.746
LOUISE:
This is, uh, Feu de Bois.

16:29.881 --> 16:31.685
It's the scent
of a log fireplace.

16:31.821 --> 16:33.853
That's good. We can stick it
next to the log fireplace.

16:33.988 --> 16:35.190
(laughter)

16:35.325 --> 16:37.291
BEN: And for the football fan.
Hut, hut!

16:37.427 --> 16:39.161
Ah, Ben, Ben,
you shouldn't have, man.

16:39.297 --> 16:40.696
-That's really-- Ant.
-Ah, please.

16:40.832 --> 16:42.793
Ant, what do we say?

16:42.928 --> 16:45.601
That's my boy. Hut!
I'm coming for you, boy.

16:45.736 --> 16:47.667
I'm trying to get him to play
more contact sports, you know?

16:47.802 --> 16:50.771
It's good... (laughs)
It's good... (kisses)

16:50.906 --> 16:53.307
-It's good for them, you know?
They need that outlet. -Yeah.

16:53.442 --> 16:55.143
God, I used to love
a tear-up, man.

16:55.278 --> 16:56.642
What about you?
Do you play ball?

16:56.777 --> 16:58.782
-BEN: Yeah, I mean, a little.
-Oh, yeah? Hut.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.416
-Wh-Whoa, whoa.
-(laughs)

17:00.552 --> 17:01.919
PADDY: My reactions ain't
what they used to be either.

17:02.055 --> 17:05.185
All right.
<i> Rosse Arance di Sicilia.</i>

17:05.320 --> 17:06.618
It's Italian blood oranges.

17:06.753 --> 17:09.021
-But look at the color in the...
-Mm-hmm. -Ooh.

17:09.157 --> 17:10.088
LOUISE:
Wow.

17:10.224 --> 17:12.995
You are VIP guests.

17:13.130 --> 17:14.492
When Paddy heard
you were coming,

17:14.628 --> 17:16.934
he butchered Libby,
our prize goose,

17:17.070 --> 17:18.366
and has been hanging her
in the outhouse.

17:18.501 --> 17:21.004
PADDY: She was some bird,
Libby. Regal girl.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.167
Real queen of the farmyard,
you know?

17:22.303 --> 17:23.635
I mean, what was she like?

17:23.771 --> 17:25.137
-She had personality.
-She had personality.

17:25.273 --> 17:26.272
(Paddy and Ciara laugh)

17:26.407 --> 17:28.509
PADDY (singsongy):
Ta-da!

17:28.644 --> 17:30.313
-Libby à l'orange.
-(Ciara and Paddy laugh)

17:30.448 --> 17:33.711
PADDY: All right.
The old man's carving forks.

17:34.413 --> 17:36.349
Sous chef, if you please.

17:36.484 --> 17:39.215
-Just to...
-Raised with love.

17:39.350 --> 17:40.656
Free-range.

17:40.791 --> 17:42.252
Our wheat,

17:42.388 --> 17:45.558
our grass, our orchards.

17:46.260 --> 17:50.567
And now, Louise, my love.

17:50.702 --> 17:53.003
Our gift to you.

17:53.139 --> 17:54.905
(chuckles):
Oh, God, that is so...

17:55.040 --> 17:56.270
It-It's just a tiny morsel.

17:56.406 --> 17:57.501
-Um, I'll try it.
-(Paddy stammers)

17:57.636 --> 17:59.844
Well, we thought, for the lady.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.377
It's the best part of the roast.

18:01.512 --> 18:04.013
Really crispy and yet
somehow manages to be soft

18:04.148 --> 18:06.480
-all at the same time.
-Mm.

18:08.049 --> 18:09.351
(chuckles)

18:11.051 --> 18:13.618
Mmm. Mmm.

18:13.754 --> 18:15.291
-PADDY: It's good, right?
-LOUISE: Mm-hmm.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.387
-It's okay? -Mmm. Very good.
-(laughing)

18:17.523 --> 18:18.921
(Paddy and Ciara laughing)

18:19.057 --> 18:20.826
BEN: Can I, uh, can I help out
with anything?

18:20.962 --> 18:23.463
PADDY: Oh, what a gent.
Uh, yeah, that would be great.

18:23.598 --> 18:26.731
Uh, serving platters,
second shelf.

18:29.140 --> 18:30.633
Oh, they're just round there.

18:30.768 --> 18:32.836
-Ah.
-Thank you. (chuckles)

18:42.249 --> 18:44.881
(Ant babbling)

18:46.859 --> 18:49.120
(Ant coughing softly)

18:49.255 --> 18:50.788
(babbling)

18:50.923 --> 18:53.092
-(hands clapping)
-PADDY: Ant, come on, mate.

18:53.228 --> 18:55.794
Bedtime. Chop-chop.

18:56.397 --> 18:59.100
That's my boy. (chuckles)

18:59.235 --> 19:01.502
-Kids, right?
-Yeah.

19:06.242 --> 19:08.142
-(Paddy sighs)
-Geez.

19:08.277 --> 19:09.576
Are those original to the house?

19:09.711 --> 19:12.950
Yeah. Keeps the heat in,
keeps the highwaymen out.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.911
Geez, it's so quiet around here.

19:15.046 --> 19:17.252
I mean, do you guys
even have any neighbors?

19:17.388 --> 19:18.584
Yeah, all the way
across the valley,

19:18.719 --> 19:20.452
but, you know,
we look after each other.

19:20.587 --> 19:22.152
BEN:
Ours are across the hall,

19:22.287 --> 19:24.587
(chuckles): and I don't think
we've ever spoken.

19:24.722 --> 19:26.430
Louise, you have a bad neck?

19:26.566 --> 19:29.430
No, uh, it's just something
that flares up sometimes.

19:29.565 --> 19:30.626
PADDY:
Medicinal? It's homegrown.

19:30.762 --> 19:32.395
No, thank you. I took a pill.

19:32.531 --> 19:35.606
Oh, modern medicine.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.339
It is amazing.

19:37.474 --> 19:39.502
But too often
we treat the symptom.

19:39.638 --> 19:41.037
We don't treat the cause.

19:41.172 --> 19:45.508
You know, technology's
advanced incredibly,

19:45.643 --> 19:47.251
but emotionally speaking,

19:47.386 --> 19:49.114
we're all still just...
(inhales sharply)

19:49.250 --> 19:50.885
cave dwellers.

19:51.020 --> 19:56.159
It's all this perfect life,
Instagram, Facebook bullshit.

19:56.295 --> 19:59.829
Everybody talking
but nobody being honest.

19:59.965 --> 20:01.925
It's left us--

20:02.060 --> 20:05.501
I don't know--
impatient and stressy.

20:05.637 --> 20:07.733
CIARA: The Internet's been down
a half a day,

20:07.868 --> 20:09.701
and I've nearly
bloody killed him, so...

20:09.836 --> 20:11.041
-(laughter)
-(Ant wailing upstairs)

20:11.176 --> 20:12.438
BEN:
I love it out here.

20:12.573 --> 20:14.707
It's like a digital detox.

20:14.842 --> 20:16.674
You know, get away from London
for a while.

20:16.810 --> 20:18.046
-(Ant continues wailing)
-PADDY: Yeah.

20:18.182 --> 20:19.444
Is he, is he all right?

20:19.579 --> 20:20.845
Oh, no, no, he's fine.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.919
-Yeah.
-Um, he'll crash in a minute.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.087
He does this sometimes.

20:24.222 --> 20:25.283
It's just part of his condition.

20:25.418 --> 20:26.617
He's not in pain?

20:26.752 --> 20:28.022
-No. -PADDY: Uh, no.
-Okay.

20:28.158 --> 20:30.561
No, no, no. No pain.

20:30.696 --> 20:32.557
-You know, I'm gonna just check
on Agnes. -Yeah. Yeah.

20:32.692 --> 20:34.392
Wait. No, no, no, no, no.
(grunts)

20:34.528 --> 20:37.301
(Ant continues wailing)

20:37.969 --> 20:39.598
(wailing stops)

20:39.734 --> 20:41.971
-(fingers snap)
-He's conked.

20:42.106 --> 20:43.934
Wow. (chuckles softly)

20:54.018 --> 20:55.486
(shuddering groan)

20:55.621 --> 20:56.747
BEN:<i> You should've</i>
<i> said something to him.</i>

20:56.883 --> 20:59.155
They killed Libby,
the golden goose.

20:59.290 --> 21:00.483
I was trying to make an effort.

21:00.618 --> 21:02.284
I know. I know.

21:02.420 --> 21:04.157
Oh.

21:04.292 --> 21:05.793
-Ew.
-What?

21:05.929 --> 21:07.231
Ben.

21:07.366 --> 21:10.200
Do you think
these have been washed?

21:10.336 --> 21:12.035
Oh, I think
we should say something.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.866
No, honey, that is an old stain.

21:15.001 --> 21:16.869
Look, we're in the country,
all right?

21:17.004 --> 21:18.774
-Our normal isn't their normal.
-(sighs heavily)

21:18.909 --> 21:22.171
They're just a bit more--
I don't know-- unvarnished.

21:22.306 --> 21:24.641
You don't think
it's weird for a doctor

21:24.777 --> 21:26.547
to live in a house like this?

21:26.682 --> 21:29.051
Look, this isn't America,
all right?

21:29.187 --> 21:30.783
He does nonprofit work.

21:30.918 --> 21:32.683
And they probably choose
to spend their money

21:32.818 --> 21:35.022
on less material things,
you know?

21:35.158 --> 21:36.760
Like vacation.

21:36.896 --> 21:38.121
(sighs) Mm-mm.

21:38.257 --> 21:40.589
Do you have any idea what
the inside of Downton Abbey

21:40.725 --> 21:42.965
actually looks like?

21:43.100 --> 21:44.867
It's a shithole.

21:45.003 --> 21:46.636
(laughing softly)

21:46.772 --> 21:48.335
Hey.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.534
Thank you for making the effort.

21:50.669 --> 21:51.934
(Louise sighs softly)

21:52.070 --> 21:54.611
-You're welcome.
-(door opens)

21:54.913 --> 21:56.078
Hello? Oh.

21:56.214 --> 21:57.376
(chuckles):
Hi, baby.

21:57.512 --> 21:59.111
I can't fall back asleep.

21:59.247 --> 22:00.780
-Oh, honey. That's all right.
-That's okay. Come on.

22:00.916 --> 22:02.652
Let me get your breathing app
going for you.

22:02.788 --> 22:05.021
No, no, no, I have it here.
Come on. Come in bed, baby.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.083
Come on, come with Mom.

22:13.928 --> 22:15.658
-AGNES: Can we
keep the light on? -No.

22:15.794 --> 22:17.163
LOUISE:
No, honey.

22:17.298 --> 22:19.136
Here we go.

22:19.272 --> 22:20.633
-Okay.
-(Agnes breathing deeply)

22:20.768 --> 22:24.775
BEN:
We just need to calm down.

22:24.910 --> 22:26.236
Settle in.

22:26.372 --> 22:29.474
I promise you guys,
it's gonna be a great weekend.

22:29.610 --> 22:31.544
(deep breathing continues)

22:31.679 --> 22:33.945
PADDY:

22:34.080 --> 22:36.179
-♪ Sweet England ♪
-(Ciara chuckles)

22:36.314 --> 22:41.191
PADDY and CIARA:

22:46.496 --> 22:49.829

22:52.765 --> 22:54.197

23:04.876 --> 23:06.242

-Oh.

23:06.377 --> 23:08.985
Don't want you getting hurt,
do we? (chuckles)

23:09.588 --> 23:11.955
PADDY: So you just
got to start slowly.

23:12.090 --> 23:13.988
It has to warm up.

23:14.123 --> 23:14.989

PADDY:
Wait, wait, see? You see?

23:27.273 --> 23:28.433
-LOUISE: Mm.
-BEN: Ooh.

23:28.568 --> 23:30.001
Cheeky bastard.

23:30.137 --> 23:32.170
-You should have brought
your rifle, hmm? -Yeah.

23:32.306 --> 23:34.807
-(laughs): I'm glad you didn't.
-(Paddy chuckles)

23:34.943 --> 23:37.446
An American
who doesn't like guns?

23:37.582 --> 23:39.646
Oh, well,
I saw my share growing up.

23:40.216 --> 23:44.654
If unchecked, foxes, they kill
all the ground-nesting birds.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.721
Predator control is essential
to a balanced ecosystem.

23:46.856 --> 23:49.120
-Balanced ecosystem.
-It is. -LOUISE: Mm.

23:49.255 --> 23:51.895
(chuckles) Yes, I'm sure
a factory-made firearm is

23:52.030 --> 23:55.028
nature's way of keeping that
delicate balance. (chuckles)

23:55.164 --> 23:56.233
Mm.

23:56.369 --> 23:59.437
-AGNES: Mom?
-Ah. Excuse me.

24:02.374 --> 24:04.904
(inhales deeply) Look at this.

24:05.703 --> 24:07.740
You... Ant?

24:07.876 --> 24:09.312
Do you think
you could move, honey,

24:09.447 --> 24:11.878
so that Agnes can have a swing?

24:13.019 --> 24:14.144
Uh, oh, hello.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.313
Um, do you mind asking Ant
if he'll move?

24:16.449 --> 24:18.687
-Just so that-- Agnes wants
to have a go. -Come on, pal.

24:18.822 --> 24:20.150
-Just for a second.
-(snorting playfully)

24:20.285 --> 24:23.527
Give you a piggyback, yeah?
Come on. (snorts)

24:24.556 --> 24:25.992
Go on.

24:26.128 --> 24:28.097
I'd have felt the back
of my dad's hand by now.

24:28.232 --> 24:30.430
Paddy, Paddy. I-It's okay.
You don't, you don't have to.

24:30.565 --> 24:33.169
It's all right, it's all right.
You want to, don't you, mate?

24:33.304 --> 24:35.498
Go on. Give Agnes a push.

24:35.633 --> 24:37.574
Good boy.

24:38.670 --> 24:39.972
(spits)

24:40.107 --> 24:43.278
(laughs): Oh, come on,
that is not a push.

24:43.414 --> 24:46.143
There. That's my boy.

24:48.654 --> 24:51.087
-You flaring up?
-Yeah, it's just a...

24:51.223 --> 24:53.486
-May I?
-Oh.

24:53.621 --> 24:55.955
Go on, loosen your knees.

24:57.490 --> 24:59.830
Oh, wow.

24:59.965 --> 25:01.531
Yeah.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.034
Your levator scapulae
is like a rope.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.701
(Louise groans)

25:06.738 --> 25:09.034
-Can we just...
-(neck cracks softly)

25:09.669 --> 25:11.472
Yeah. (sighs)

25:11.607 --> 25:13.577
(Louise chuckles nervously)

25:14.378 --> 25:16.574
I know what you need.

25:16.710 --> 25:18.143
Cold water therapy.

25:18.279 --> 25:21.810
Clinically proven to reduce
inflammation and? Anyone?

25:21.946 --> 25:22.911
Boost the immune system.

25:23.047 --> 25:24.555
-LOUISE: Oh.
-Yeah.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.218
W-Well, we didn't bring
our swimsuits.

25:26.354 --> 25:27.717
Oh, that's all right.
You can keep you knickers on.

25:27.852 --> 25:29.621
Oh, what happened?

25:29.757 --> 25:31.390
(chuckles):
Oh, um...

25:31.525 --> 25:33.795
Oh, uh, it got a little bit out
of hand last night. (chuckles)

25:33.931 --> 25:36.662
(chuckles): I fell off
a ladder, picking apples.

25:36.797 --> 25:38.661
PADDY:
Come on, you lot.

25:38.797 --> 25:40.465
Get your kit off.

25:40.600 --> 25:43.165
I promise we'll whack up the
heating in the car afterwards

25:43.301 --> 25:46.973
and we will be warm again
in no time.

25:49.474 --> 25:52.048
You shouldn't be shy, Louise.
Got a great body.

25:52.184 --> 25:53.246
Oh, thank you.

25:53.381 --> 25:55.247
Yeah.

25:55.382 --> 25:57.280
Right. Make sure when
you jump out, clear the rocks.

25:57.416 --> 25:59.656
All right. Ant, Agnes,
jump with the dads, yeah?

25:59.791 --> 26:01.219
-Ready? In three, two...
-LOUISE: Oh, hold on.

26:01.355 --> 26:04.221
One-one second. Sorry, sorry.
Uh, uh... (stammers)

26:04.356 --> 26:06.093
-Is it safe? Is it deep enough?
-Uh, yeah.

26:06.229 --> 26:08.026
I've done it hundreds of times,
since I was her age.

26:08.161 --> 26:09.829
Yeah, just mind
you clear the rocks.

26:09.965 --> 26:12.937
All right,
in three, two, one, go!

26:13.072 --> 26:15.232
(all yell)

26:16.637 --> 26:18.475
(Louise laughs)

26:18.610 --> 26:20.439
-Oh! Whoo!
-(Ant coughing, gasping)

26:20.574 --> 26:21.809
Go on, boy!

26:21.945 --> 26:23.645
-Paddy, can he swim?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:23.781 --> 26:25.514
Same way I learned:
sink or swim.

26:25.649 --> 26:27.946
He'll be fine. Go on, Ant.

26:28.082 --> 26:29.783
Oh, my God,
can Ant... can Ant swim?

26:29.919 --> 26:32.054
Oh, don't worry.
Paddy's got him.

26:32.189 --> 26:32.949
Shall we?

26:33.085 --> 26:35.486
Oh, um... uh, y-you go ahead.

26:35.621 --> 26:37.388
Okay.

26:37.524 --> 26:39.861
(whoops)

26:42.064 --> 26:43.827
-CIARA: Come on, Louise!
-PADDY: Go, Louise!

26:43.963 --> 26:45.295
-Come on!
-(whooping)

26:45.431 --> 26:47.034
-Come on, jump, jump, jump!
-Come on, jump!

26:47.169 --> 26:50.766
(chanting): Jump! Jump!
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

26:50.902 --> 26:52.370
Jump! Jump! Jump!

26:52.505 --> 26:54.743
-(Ciara whoops, laughs)
-(Paddy grunting playfully)

26:54.878 --> 26:56.038
-(hair dryer whirs, pops)
-(Louise shrieks)

26:56.173 --> 26:58.778
-(gasps) Oh, God.
-Geez!

26:58.913 --> 27:01.051
That's a fucking fire hazard.

27:01.186 --> 27:02.620
(Louise panting)

27:02.755 --> 27:06.687
Look, Louise,
do you want to take a nap?

27:06.822 --> 27:09.855
(laughs)
Yeah, in their dirty bed?

27:09.990 --> 27:13.092
Okay, let's everybody just...

27:14.365 --> 27:15.532
I'm sorry.

27:15.668 --> 27:18.331
I am trying.
I really, really am.

27:18.466 --> 27:20.034
I just...

27:20.169 --> 27:22.634
I don't find them
that pleasant to be around.

27:22.769 --> 27:24.334
BEN:
Okay.

27:24.469 --> 27:28.675
Maybe we could use my neck
as an excuse.

27:28.811 --> 27:30.775
-To leave?
-(knock on door)

27:30.911 --> 27:32.380
-Hey.
-LOUISE: Hi.

27:32.515 --> 27:33.544
Am I interrupting?

27:33.679 --> 27:35.316
N-No.

27:35.451 --> 27:38.249
Well, Paddy and I would like to
invite you for dinner tonight.

27:38.384 --> 27:40.490
-Ooh.
-Yeah, there's this guy Mike.

27:40.625 --> 27:42.052
He's a bit of a local legend.

27:42.187 --> 27:43.594
I mean, rumor is he's a poacher,

27:43.729 --> 27:45.158
but he's an amazing cook.
(chuckles)

27:45.293 --> 27:47.589
And, um, he has
this little place by the sea.

27:47.725 --> 27:50.431
Private room,
like a chef's table type thing.

27:50.567 --> 27:51.633
-Oh, wow.
-Mmm.

27:51.769 --> 27:52.866
Yeah, and it's super authentic,

27:53.001 --> 27:55.031
everything fresh, local.
(chuckles)

27:55.167 --> 27:57.805
-Um... great.
-Great.

27:57.941 --> 28:00.238
-BEN: We-We'd love to.
-Great.

28:03.878 --> 28:07.113
She seems really unpleasant.

28:08.716 --> 28:10.248
Okay, I was j--

28:12.584 --> 28:15.956
Hey, let's...
let's try and reboot.

28:16.091 --> 28:18.060
All right?
Remember what Nadine said?

28:18.195 --> 28:21.694
Let's not make the perfect
the enemy of the good.

28:21.829 --> 28:23.426
(Louise groans softly)

28:24.631 --> 28:26.263
(kisses)

28:26.399 --> 28:27.903
AGNES: Oh, I hope
they have French fries.

28:28.038 --> 28:29.400
Well, I'm sure
they will have chips,

28:29.535 --> 28:31.135
because that's
what they're called here.

28:31.271 --> 28:33.971
-(Ciara laughs)
-Oh, wow! (laughs)

28:34.107 --> 28:35.911
You look like a million bucks.

28:36.046 --> 28:37.614
-Thank you. You look lovely.
-(Louise laughs)

28:37.750 --> 28:39.448
PADDY:
You know what they say, man.

28:39.584 --> 28:41.378
Happy wife, happy life.

28:41.513 --> 28:43.584
We don't actually shop
that often.

28:43.719 --> 28:44.984
I mean, our philosophy...

28:45.120 --> 28:47.089
Spend wisely
on the things that last.

28:47.225 --> 28:50.690
Yeah, that last, like, uh,
a watch or a ring or a memory.

28:50.826 --> 28:52.292
-(laughs)
-Like Italy.

28:52.427 --> 28:54.429
CIARA: Yeah, and everything's
so disposable now,

28:54.564 --> 28:55.727
so "fast fashion."

28:55.862 --> 28:57.760
Isn't Ant coming?

28:58.163 --> 29:01.437
Hey, Muhj! There he is.

29:02.006 --> 29:03.972
So, Muhjid doesn't speak
the best English,

29:04.107 --> 29:06.037
-but he's a great babysitter.
-Hello.

29:06.172 --> 29:07.877
LOUISE:
You're-- Oh.

29:08.012 --> 29:09.374
Oh, the-- are the kids
not coming with us?

29:09.509 --> 29:10.876
CIARA: Oh, no,
tonight's without the kids.

29:11.011 --> 29:12.243
Didn't I tell you that?

29:12.379 --> 29:14.684
PADDY: Muhj had to flee
the war in Syria.

29:14.820 --> 29:16.451
His hometown, Homs,
just obliterated.

29:16.587 --> 29:17.552
LOUISE:
Oh.

29:17.688 --> 29:18.816
God, I'm so sorry.

29:18.952 --> 29:20.519
Oh, thank you, sir.

29:20.654 --> 29:22.392
PADDY: Poor bugger, he's stuck
in the asylum system.

29:22.528 --> 29:24.094
Can't officially work.

29:24.229 --> 29:26.124
CIARA: Don't worry.
He's thoroughly trustworthy.

29:26.260 --> 29:28.093
-Back home, he was a teacher.
-Oh.

29:28.229 --> 29:29.458
CIARA:
He's great with kids.

29:29.594 --> 29:31.131
The whole neighborhood
feels the same.

29:31.267 --> 29:32.361
And not just 'cause he's cheap.
(laughs)

29:32.496 --> 29:34.369
(laughs)
Yeah, and the best part is

29:34.504 --> 29:35.999
if there's any monkey business,
we'll get him deported.

29:36.135 --> 29:37.741
(Paddy and Ciara laugh)

29:37.876 --> 29:39.435
-Brother, have a great night.
-Come.

29:39.570 --> 29:43.011
Come with me.
Let me show you. Come.

29:44.315 --> 29:46.610
LOUISE: So do you think
we should leave her with him?

29:46.746 --> 29:50.414
BEN: We've had nannies before,
and he was a teacher.

29:50.549 --> 29:52.253
Come on, Louise.
Let's go have a good time.

29:52.389 --> 29:54.587
-(chuckles) Okay. Bye, baby.
-PADDY: Hey, guys! Coming?

29:54.723 --> 29:57.458
Come. Come, come.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.060
Oh, my God.

30:31.196 --> 30:33.425
Yep, America's that way.
Dinner's that way.

30:33.561 --> 30:37.697
The good news is,
we're the only diners tonight.

30:37.832 --> 30:39.164
Oh, it's so cute.

30:39.300 --> 30:42.636
Yep.
Not gonna find this on Yelp.

30:43.439 --> 30:46.071
Mike goes out at night on
his own, sources all the food.

30:46.207 --> 30:48.237
Incredible chef. He's...
(laughs)

30:48.373 --> 30:49.847
You should taste his game pie.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.073
-It's like... (gobbling)
-(Ciara laughs)

30:51.208 --> 30:52.476
PADDY:
Amazing.

30:52.611 --> 30:55.111
Um, but just to remember,
I'm a vegetarian.

30:55.247 --> 30:57.219
-Wait, yesterday.
-I know.

30:57.355 --> 30:59.049
I'm... (laughs nervously)
I should have said something.

30:59.185 --> 31:00.384
I just-- I-- (stammers)

31:00.519 --> 31:02.188
You guys had gone
to so much trouble...

31:02.323 --> 31:03.652
-CIARA: Oh, it's...
-Oh, mate, mate.

31:03.788 --> 31:05.056
I feel like such an idiot.
I'm so sorry.

31:05.192 --> 31:06.622
BEN:
It was okay. Uh...

31:06.758 --> 31:07.994
-Yeah, it was okay. (chuckles)
-PADDY: Okay?

31:08.129 --> 31:09.394
Really, don't worry about it.

31:09.529 --> 31:11.198
Great. But you do still
eat fish, yeah?

31:11.333 --> 31:14.570
-Yes. -Great. But--
Fish is not a meat?

31:14.705 --> 31:16.138
(chuckles) Of course.

31:16.274 --> 31:18.875
But, you know, it's better
for the environment.

31:19.011 --> 31:19.970
Yeah, but the way
that industrial fishing

31:20.105 --> 31:21.506
treats the oceans.

31:21.641 --> 31:24.441
That is why I fundraise
for sustainable fishing

31:24.576 --> 31:26.180
and for ecolabeling
on packaging...

31:26.316 --> 31:28.681
That kind of pescatarianism
is a privilege.

31:28.816 --> 31:31.582
LOUISE: Absolutely, but that's
not a reason not to do it.

31:31.717 --> 31:33.287
PADDY: What if you can't afford
line-caught?

31:33.422 --> 31:34.820
LOUISE: Well, surely
you're not advocating

31:34.956 --> 31:36.553
we all eat factory meat.

31:36.688 --> 31:40.194
Rather than, you know, Libby.
(chuckles)

31:41.997 --> 31:44.796
It's... complicated.

31:44.932 --> 31:46.932
Can we agree?

31:47.568 --> 31:50.000
It is. It's complicated.
It is really complicated.

31:50.136 --> 31:51.867
And complicated is good.

31:52.003 --> 31:53.770
Too many people these days
are afraid of honest debate.

31:53.905 --> 31:55.672
Aren't they?
We're all too fucking polite.

31:55.807 --> 31:58.911
-Hey. Look at this sucker.
-There you go, eh? -Whoa.

31:59.047 --> 32:00.212
Now, we trust that this is

32:00.348 --> 32:02.044
sustainably sourced seafood,
Mike.

32:02.180 --> 32:03.646
MIKE: Yeah, well, it's, uh,
it's done with Devon butter,

32:03.781 --> 32:05.989
uh, wild samphire,
forest-foraged mushrooms,

32:06.124 --> 32:08.151
cooked in, uh,
sustainable Devon cream, eh?

32:08.287 --> 32:09.853
-Fantastic.
-Yeah.

32:09.988 --> 32:11.622
Uh, not the poisonous ones,
right? We can trust you, Mike?

32:11.758 --> 32:13.024
Oh, well, that would be
telling, wouldn't it?

32:13.159 --> 32:15.192
(Paddy and Mike laughing)

32:15.327 --> 32:17.193
Right. Pot time. (chuckles)

32:46.028 --> 32:48.262
I don't understand.

32:51.902 --> 32:53.663

-like your parents or you go
the opposite way, right? -Mm.

I never met mine. (chuckles)

33:22.233 --> 33:24.427
PADDY:
Hey, that's their loss, baby.

33:24.562 --> 33:26.436
-Their loss.

the French, a couple of cunts.

She fucking...

34:33.233 --> 34:35.567
She rescued me, this one.

34:37.336 --> 34:38.536
Saved me from the pit.

-Straightened me out.

39:36.067 --> 39:38.567
-But you... you are so angry.
-Yes!

39:38.702 --> 39:42.208
-For seeing another man's dick
on my wife's phone? -(shushes)

39:42.343 --> 39:44.013
Please. Listen.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.448
I am not excusing that,

39:45.583 --> 39:48.045
but you were angry
long before that, okay?

39:48.180 --> 39:50.146
You are so bitter at the world
for not giving you

39:50.282 --> 39:52.115
what you think you deserve
that-that you don't

39:52.250 --> 39:54.322
-see all the things
in front of you. -(stammers)

39:54.457 --> 39:56.289
You can't turn this all on me.

39:56.425 --> 39:58.257
I moved to London for you.

39:58.392 --> 39:59.624
I upended my life.

39:59.759 --> 40:01.761
I lost my job. I lost my house.

40:01.896 --> 40:05.028
I lost everything
that makes me me, for you.

40:05.163 --> 40:07.433
And when you lost your job,
I agreed to stay

40:07.568 --> 40:09.404
and help you and support you

40:09.539 --> 40:10.869
and keep your life
running smoothly

40:11.005 --> 40:13.135
so that you could have access
to all of Europe.

40:13.270 --> 40:16.138
But where the fuck is
my access to my husband?

40:16.273 --> 40:18.144
You know, I-I don't know
if you're with me

40:18.279 --> 40:22.551
because you love me or because
you just can't stand to fail.

40:25.321 --> 40:26.885
(softly):
Look.

40:27.784 --> 40:29.987
Louise, I'm...

40:32.656 --> 40:34.325
I do care.

40:34.460 --> 40:36.092
I'm...

40:36.728 --> 40:38.963
I'm really trying.

40:41.732 --> 40:44.001
(sighs heavily)

40:44.835 --> 40:47.008
(clicks tongue) Yes.

40:47.143 --> 40:48.272
We both are.

40:48.408 --> 40:50.513
(sighs)

40:52.181 --> 40:54.113
Let's...

40:54.248 --> 40:56.853
please...

40:56.988 --> 40:59.588
be friends.

41:03.324 --> 41:05.891
(Ben sighs)

41:12.334 --> 41:14.196
Look, I'm sorry.

41:17.240 --> 41:19.168
I'm sorry.

41:32.255 --> 41:34.491
(door creaking)

41:37.527 --> 41:39.958
(floorboards creaking softly)

42:08.390 --> 42:10.758
(door creaking)

42:21.406 --> 42:23.837
(whispers):
Agnes, baby.

42:34.084 --> 42:35.211
Ben.

42:36.086 --> 42:37.920
Ben.

42:38.055 --> 42:38.915
What?

42:39.050 --> 42:41.723
-We're leaving.
-What?

43:01.542 --> 43:03.910
(car doors close)

43:14.754 --> 43:16.390
(Agnes breathing heavily)

43:16.526 --> 43:19.596
Mom? Where's Hoppy?

43:21.564 --> 43:22.991
Uh, I-I don't know.

43:23.127 --> 43:25.167
Did you have him when we left?

43:25.302 --> 43:27.131
I don't think so.

43:29.173 --> 43:30.640
(bag unzips)

43:39.381 --> 43:40.914
(Ben grunts)

43:45.184 --> 43:47.588
LOUISE:
<i> Sweetie, he's not there.</i>

43:47.723 --> 43:49.052
AGNES:
<i> I want Hoppy.</i>

43:49.188 --> 43:50.723
Agnes, you got to grow
out of this.

43:50.858 --> 43:52.395
You're almost 12 years old.

43:52.530 --> 43:54.558
Ben, it's not helpful. Please.

43:54.693 --> 43:58.025
Listen, when we get home, we'll
ask them to mail him, okay?

43:58.161 --> 43:59.802
He'll get hurt like Ant.

43:59.938 --> 44:02.068
Honey, Ant's not hurt.
He was born like that.

44:02.203 --> 44:04.736
-We'll buy another Hoppy.
-No, I need my Hoppy!

44:04.872 --> 44:06.434
Agnes, please calm down, okay?

44:06.570 --> 44:08.675
-They're gonna do that to Hoppy!
-Breathe. Agnes!

44:08.811 --> 44:10.105
-(grunts angrily)
-Hey! Enough!

44:10.241 --> 44:12.280
-Hey!
-(truck horn blaring)

44:12.416 --> 44:14.711
(yelps) Oh, my God!

44:14.847 --> 44:17.518
(panting) Oh, Jesus.

44:17.653 --> 44:21.251
Oh. You okay? Are you okay?

44:24.028 --> 44:26.495
We can't leave him there.
We can't leave him there.

44:26.631 --> 44:28.597
They're gonna do that to Hoppy.

44:28.733 --> 44:30.761
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

44:30.896 --> 44:32.966
(Agnes breathing heavily)

45:02.596 --> 45:04.899
(birds chirping)

45:06.330 --> 45:08.833
All right. I'll be right back.

45:08.968 --> 45:10.200
What if they're awake?

45:10.336 --> 45:14.106
Louise, just give me
two minutes, okay?

45:16.280 --> 45:17.846
(sighs)

45:42.703 --> 45:44.400
(Louise sighs)

45:45.473 --> 45:46.876
Okay.

45:47.011 --> 45:49.878
-Be right back, okay? Okay?
-(seat belt clicks)

46:02.756 --> 46:04.794
(gate creaks)

46:15.334 --> 46:17.604
-PADDY: (grunts) No. No.
-Louise, um,

46:17.740 --> 46:19.006
j-just go back to the car.

46:19.141 --> 46:20.736
-I'll be there in two minutes.
-(sighs)

46:20.872 --> 46:22.941
Look, like I said, we didn't
want to, like, wake you...

46:23.076 --> 46:24.341
-What?
-What's going on?

46:24.476 --> 46:26.277
Uh, we've got
a bit of a situation.

46:26.413 --> 46:28.414
Someone was leaving
without saying goodbye.

46:28.550 --> 46:32.683
No, look, I was just saying to
Paddy we had such a good time.

46:32.818 --> 46:35.855
Well, then I've got to ask
again, wait, why did you leave?

46:35.991 --> 46:38.056
-Be honest.
-(Ben stammers)

46:38.192 --> 46:40.294
Look, look,
some-some things happened

46:40.429 --> 46:43.558
that made us feel like it was
best that we head back home.

46:43.694 --> 46:46.435
What things?
Uh, I think we deserve to know.

46:46.570 --> 46:47.863
CIARA:
Mm-hmm.

46:48.666 --> 46:51.841
A-Agnes doesn't like
sleeping on the floor,

46:51.976 --> 46:54.239
and so she-she comes
into the room at night

46:54.374 --> 46:56.443
and the-the bed's
really small, so we...

46:56.578 --> 46:59.378
-I'm sorry that our house
isn't huge... -No, it's not...

46:59.513 --> 47:00.881
CIARA: ...and that
Agnes doesn't feel comfortable

47:01.016 --> 47:02.450
-in Ant's room, but...
-No!

47:02.586 --> 47:03.519
She was in your bed.

47:03.654 --> 47:04.953
-PADDY: What?
-Yeah.

47:05.088 --> 47:06.249
-Who? What?
-Our daughter was in your bed.

47:06.385 --> 47:07.723
-Yes, I'm sorry. Okay?
-Ciara?

47:07.859 --> 47:09.052
Paddy was asleep
for the whole thing.

47:09.187 --> 47:10.719
That's my fault, okay?

47:10.855 --> 47:12.955
Well, I'm-I'm sorry,
but-but that is crossing a line.

47:13.090 --> 47:15.497
-I mean, th-that is not okay.
-Uh, it's my fault. I'm sorry.

47:15.632 --> 47:17.132
I'm-I'm sorry.

47:17.268 --> 47:19.735
I... Look, I know I can be
overprotective as a mother.

47:19.871 --> 47:22.237
Wh-What does that
have to do with it?

47:22.973 --> 47:25.603
(chuckles)
We had a baby daughter.

47:25.739 --> 47:27.836
Uh, no.

47:27.971 --> 47:30.011
Mary.

47:30.146 --> 47:35.950
And, um, she died
at 12 weeks of a cot death.

47:36.086 --> 47:38.681
We would've been
the perfect family.

47:39.617 --> 47:42.619
So hearing Agnes crying,
it just... (sobs softly)

47:43.422 --> 47:45.588
Um, so, she was just--
she-she was--

47:45.723 --> 47:48.162
She kept calling for you,
and-and you didn't come,

47:48.298 --> 47:50.899
and she was beside herself,
scratching herself and...

47:51.035 --> 47:52.760
Well, and you weren't
there, so...

47:52.896 --> 47:55.102
Look, you-you know how hard
it is trying to decide

47:55.237 --> 47:57.270
when to intervene
and when to give them space,

47:57.406 --> 47:59.842
and I'm... I'm so sorry
if I got it wrong.

47:59.977 --> 48:02.142
I'm so sorry.
(breath trembling)

48:02.277 --> 48:04.039
-Ciara. I didn't know.
-Like, we are...

48:04.175 --> 48:06.846
Mom! Ant found him!

48:06.982 --> 48:08.343
-Oh, good. (sighs)
-Oh.

48:08.478 --> 48:10.183
PADDY:
Good boy. Good boy.

48:10.319 --> 48:12.486
-(Ant clucking)
-(Ciara and Paddy chuckling)

48:12.621 --> 48:14.824
-What's he saying? -PADDY:
I think he's trying to say

48:14.959 --> 48:16.520
he's sad
you're leaving because...

48:16.655 --> 48:18.855
'cause he wanted to show you
the chickens.

48:18.990 --> 48:20.627
(Paddy chuckles)

48:20.762 --> 48:22.363
-Can we?
-Uh...

48:22.499 --> 48:24.795
Hey, you remember that time,
the first time you came to stay

48:24.930 --> 48:26.529
and you tried to leave 'cause
you flipped out in the night

48:26.665 --> 48:28.799
-and you didn't say goodbye?
-(chuckles)

48:28.935 --> 48:31.303
Eh? (laughing)

48:33.208 --> 48:35.977
-(birds chirping)
-(chickens clucking)

48:36.113 --> 48:38.409
They look sweet together,
don't they?

48:40.914 --> 48:43.117
We wanted another.

48:43.816 --> 48:46.555
But...

48:46.690 --> 48:49.854
after two miscarriages...

48:50.523 --> 48:55.195
CIARA: Life can be
so fucking unfair. Sorry.

48:58.098 --> 49:00.162
I don't understand.

49:00.298 --> 49:02.635
Ant, I can't read it.

49:02.770 --> 49:05.975
(stammering)

49:10.114 --> 49:13.642
-How are your eggs
coming along? -Good.

49:14.211 --> 49:17.052
Let's see.

49:18.450 --> 49:20.788
LOUISE:
Oh, these are great.

49:20.924 --> 49:22.517
CIARA:
I think, Agnes,

49:22.653 --> 49:25.526
that yours is the best.
(chuckles)

49:25.662 --> 49:27.661
(Louise chuckles)

49:27.797 --> 49:29.594
LOUISE:
Oh.

49:29.730 --> 49:31.794
("Eternal Flame" by The Bangles
playing over speakers)

49:31.930 --> 49:34.264
(Paddy singing along quietly):

49:34.400 --> 49:38.138

49:38.274 --> 49:41.974

49:59.323 --> 50:02.058
But it made no sense.

50:02.194 --> 50:04.466
It was gobbledygook.

50:04.602 --> 50:05.929
Can I see it?

50:06.064 --> 50:08.466
He ate it.

50:10.306 --> 50:12.234
LOUISE: I think
he's going through a lot,

50:12.370 --> 50:14.176
and we need to be kind.

50:14.311 --> 50:16.273
-Okay? -No, something's
not right with him.

50:16.408 --> 50:17.606
(chuckles):
Okay, Agnes,

50:17.741 --> 50:19.210
sometimes it's okay
to think things,

50:19.345 --> 50:20.814
but you can't actually say them.

50:20.950 --> 50:22.244
Mom, it's not normal.

50:22.380 --> 50:23.545
CIARA:
Agnes, love,

50:23.681 --> 50:26.653
do you want to
come help me peel these?

50:26.955 --> 50:29.091
(Louise chuckles softly)

50:32.126 --> 50:34.393
Some nice carrots, hmm?

50:49.008 --> 50:50.741
Sorry, man.

50:50.877 --> 50:52.043
Oh.

50:52.179 --> 50:53.945
No, here, give me that.

50:54.081 --> 50:56.583
Here we go. (sniffs)

50:56.719 --> 50:58.384
(sighs)

50:59.816 --> 51:02.055
It's not even about
the kill for me.

51:02.190 --> 51:04.620
It's always been about the hunt.

51:04.756 --> 51:06.657
You know?
Getting them in the crosshairs.

51:06.792 --> 51:10.194
Luring the fish onto the hook.
That's the game.

51:10.329 --> 51:13.168
That's what I live for.

51:17.469 --> 51:20.439
Look, maybe this isn't my place,

51:20.574 --> 51:24.074
but last night,
we heard you two shouting.

51:24.210 --> 51:25.510
I'm sorry, man.

51:25.645 --> 51:28.144
You know, cheating is
really hard to get over.

51:28.279 --> 51:30.918
(sighs heavily)

51:31.053 --> 51:32.051
Louise didn't actually.

51:32.186 --> 51:35.520
It was... it was just text.

51:36.954 --> 51:39.891
Mm. Whatever she did,
thoughtcrime or whatever,

51:40.027 --> 51:42.296
just-- who cares?

51:43.161 --> 51:44.831
All this...

51:44.967 --> 51:48.236
all this in here...

51:50.139 --> 51:52.537
That's gonna eat you alive.

51:54.240 --> 51:56.508
You got to let it out.

51:58.347 --> 52:00.776
Will you let me
show you something?

52:12.292 --> 52:14.691
(Paddy panting heavily)

52:15.798 --> 52:19.168
(yelling wildly)

52:21.234 --> 52:24.437
(Paddy breathing heavily)

52:28.272 --> 52:29.272
(yelling wildly)

52:29.407 --> 52:32.544
(both yelling wildly)

52:35.149 --> 52:37.450
(both gasping for breath)

52:38.414 --> 52:40.783
(yelling wildly)

52:42.418 --> 52:45.090
(yelling wildly)

52:45.225 --> 52:47.526
(both yelling wildly)

52:52.630 --> 52:55.930
(both breathing heavily,
laughing)

52:58.067 --> 52:59.771
-PADDY: I'm starving!
-(Ciara laughs)

52:59.906 --> 53:01.541
-And you do it four times.
-PADDY: Could eat a horse!

53:01.677 --> 53:02.911
And then-- Do you want me
to show you the first part?

53:03.047 --> 53:04.408
Could eat a Ciara. (chuckles)

53:04.543 --> 53:06.312
So it's like that. One, two...

53:06.448 --> 53:09.582
Oy, oy, come on.
Careful, kids. All right?

53:09.717 --> 53:12.046
You knock over one of
your mother's sculptures

53:12.181 --> 53:14.221
-and there will be hell to pay.
-(Ciara chuckles)

53:14.357 --> 53:15.586
-Have you shown them these?
-No.

53:15.722 --> 53:17.758
Guys, have you seen this?
This is Ciara's.

53:17.893 --> 53:19.490
One of many.

53:19.626 --> 53:22.095
It's called<i> Mother's Love.</i>

53:22.231 --> 53:23.460
-BEN: Wow.
-LOUISE: Oh.

53:23.596 --> 53:24.759
-Yeah? Yeah, one of many.
-Oh, God.

53:24.895 --> 53:27.229
-Ciara, those are stunning.
-Wow.

53:27.365 --> 53:29.337
-I mean, it's just a hobby.
-Hey, don't put yourself down.

53:29.472 --> 53:30.934
That's my job.
Louise, thank you so much

53:31.069 --> 53:32.670
-for helping with the cooking.
-Yeah. Of course. -Paddy.

53:32.806 --> 53:35.476
Mom. Mom. Can Ant and I
show you our dance?

53:35.612 --> 53:37.105
-LOUISE: Ye-- -CIARA: Oh.
Maybe after lunch, sweetie.

53:37.240 --> 53:39.914
Actually, Agnes, could you set
the table for me, please?

53:40.050 --> 53:41.482
Oh, yeah. Go on, Agnes.

53:41.618 --> 53:44.249
Show Ciara how good you are
at setting the table.

53:44.385 --> 53:45.516
(pained yelp, inhales sharply)

53:45.652 --> 53:47.081
-Ooh. -Oh, God.
-What happened?

53:47.217 --> 53:48.652
-Honey, honey, run it
under the tap. -Mm, mm, mm.

53:48.788 --> 53:50.425
-You okay? -You all right?
-Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

53:50.561 --> 53:52.622
Hey, um, uh, Paddy, can you
come take a look at this?

53:52.758 --> 53:54.593
-(Louise shuddering)
-Uh, yeah, sure.

53:54.729 --> 53:56.798
Thank God there's a doctor
in the house.

53:56.933 --> 53:58.261
I'm not a doctor.

53:58.397 --> 53:59.928
-What?
-Wait.

54:00.064 --> 54:02.263
Well, didn't you say
you were a doctor?

54:02.398 --> 54:04.369
Did I?

54:04.504 --> 54:06.935
BEN:
In-in Italy, you...

54:08.439 --> 54:09.740
(sighs) Look.

54:09.875 --> 54:12.843
Uh, sometimes
when I meet new people, I...

54:12.978 --> 54:14.712
I'll get a little bit
self-conscious, you know?

54:14.848 --> 54:17.482
-He just wants to make
a good impression. -Yeah.

54:17.618 --> 54:19.647
What do you,
what do you do, then?

54:19.783 --> 54:21.484
Well, I don't do anything.

54:21.619 --> 54:23.118
BEN:
Like, anything?

54:23.254 --> 54:26.128
No. Well, I don't work.
I don't believe in it.

54:26.264 --> 54:27.593
-LOUISE: Oh.
-Yeah, we get by, right?

54:27.729 --> 54:29.692
-Mm. Mm. -Yeah, we sell
a bit of marijuana,

54:29.828 --> 54:31.500
drop a bit of cider
to the locals.

54:31.635 --> 54:33.263
Let's get that fixed.
Where's the plasters?

54:33.398 --> 54:34.364
CIARA:
Oh.

54:34.499 --> 54:35.964
(Paddy clears throat)

54:38.602 --> 54:40.903
(both giggling, laughing)

54:41.772 --> 54:43.944
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

54:44.080 --> 54:45.512
Look at their faces.

54:45.648 --> 54:47.709
CIARA: You should have
taken a picture. (laughs)

54:47.844 --> 54:50.251
Of course I'm a bloody doctor.

54:50.387 --> 54:52.454
-Oh! -(laughter)
-We totally had them.

54:52.590 --> 54:54.222
-We totally had them, right?
-Well, yeah, I mean...

54:54.358 --> 54:55.785
(laughing):
You fucking asshole.

54:55.920 --> 54:58.386
Come on. How else
could we afford all this?

54:58.521 --> 54:59.354
Come here.

54:59.489 --> 55:00.895
(laughter)

55:01.031 --> 55:02.364
(chickens clucking)

55:02.500 --> 55:03.861
-PADDY: Here, try that.
-BEN: What is this?

55:03.996 --> 55:05.627
They say it smells like
a rugby club locker room.

55:05.762 --> 55:07.661
LOUISE and BEN:
Mmm!

55:07.797 --> 55:09.063
PADDY:
Yeah, right?

55:09.198 --> 55:10.800
Agnes, love, you have to eat
your vegetables.

55:10.936 --> 55:12.340
PADDY:
...I'm increasingly finding

55:12.475 --> 55:13.635
the simple things in life
bring you joy.

55:13.770 --> 55:15.169
Eat your greens, sweetheart.

55:15.304 --> 55:18.610
And, Agnes, we don't chew
with our mouths open.

55:18.746 --> 55:21.482
PADDY: Gorgonzola,
Camembert, Emmental.

55:21.617 --> 55:24.285
You can keep it.
Stinking Bishop is number one.

55:24.421 --> 55:26.654
-BEN: Never had it.
-Get it. -Agnes?

55:26.790 --> 55:29.154
Please, could you stop
telling my daughter what to do?

55:29.289 --> 55:30.389
BEN:
Mmm!

55:30.524 --> 55:32.055
But she needs to be told, so...

55:32.191 --> 55:33.490
Yes, but you're not her mother.
I'm her mother.

55:33.626 --> 55:35.057
Yeah. But you do agree, right?

55:35.193 --> 55:36.557
That it's disgusting
eating with my mouth open.

55:36.693 --> 55:38.193
(laughs):
Okay.

55:38.329 --> 55:40.531
(laughs): Yeah. But it's for
her parents to tell her.

55:40.666 --> 55:42.404
-Is that the rule?
-Yeah.

55:42.539 --> 55:45.537
Mm. No, Ciara grew up
in the care system.

55:45.673 --> 55:47.437
All the kids
parenting each other,

55:47.573 --> 55:48.905
doing what they were told.

55:49.041 --> 55:52.107
I mean, she doesn't know
"the rules." Sorry.

55:52.242 --> 55:54.012
CIARA: I didn't mean anything
by it, Louise.

55:54.147 --> 55:56.045
PADDY: To be fair, though, you
did cross a line for Louise.

55:56.181 --> 55:57.513
You don't criticize
other people's children.

55:57.648 --> 55:59.253
You should say sorry.

55:59.389 --> 56:00.252
(chuckles):
It's okay.

56:00.387 --> 56:01.383
I'm sorry, Louise.

56:01.519 --> 56:03.892
And to Agnes.

56:04.027 --> 56:05.124
I'm sorry, Agnes.

56:05.259 --> 56:06.890
It's okay.

56:07.590 --> 56:10.124
Louise?

56:11.699 --> 56:14.403
There anything
you'd like to say?

56:17.568 --> 56:18.433
(chuckles softly)

56:18.568 --> 56:21.007
I-I maybe...

56:21.142 --> 56:22.538
overreacted.

56:22.674 --> 56:24.809
Off we go. It's all good.

56:24.945 --> 56:26.481
It's all good.
A healthy disagreement.

56:26.617 --> 56:30.085
Teach our kids we can be honest
with each other.

56:30.221 --> 56:32.649
Right, top up. (clears throat)

56:33.252 --> 56:36.151
Agnes, um, why don't
you and Ant show us your, um,

56:36.287 --> 56:38.423
your dance routine
y'all have been working on?

56:38.558 --> 56:40.756
-(chuckles): Yes.
-Sure.

56:41.359 --> 56:44.030
-Is it all set up, ready to go
in the tape deck? -Yep.

56:44.165 --> 56:45.530
All right.

56:45.666 --> 56:48.231
You tell me when you're ready.

56:48.366 --> 56:49.802
Ready.
