1983

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:44.875
A million, million, million scarlet roses

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.250
From the window, from the window,
from the window you see

00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:56.625
A million, million, million scarlet roses

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.458
From the window, from the window,
from the window you see

00:02:03.708 --> 00:02:04.958
Who's in love, who's...

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.625
Won't you sing with me?

00:02:07.708 --> 00:02:09.291
Or should I inform Mission Control

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:12.208
that the commander's psychological
condition has worsened?

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.208
-Go ahead.
-Alright.

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:17.875
Then let's sing something you like.

00:02:18.833 --> 00:02:21.458
You know, I used to kind of like
that part about the roses...

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.375
You see.

00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:24.333
...a couple months ago.

00:02:27.833 --> 00:02:29.000
What's happening, Cheget?

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:33.208
Ready for undocking.
The system is functioning normally.

00:02:34.125 --> 00:02:36.500
Pressure CA 730 BO 730.

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:38.958
Roger! Everything according to schedule!

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.000
So here's my plan!

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:45.083
When we get out of recovery,
I'm going home.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.875
To my elevator, then my apartment.
I'll take off my shoes

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:50.583
and go straight down the hallway
to the very end...

00:02:51.458 --> 00:02:54.208
And turn on the hot water.

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:58.875
And then just a tiny bit of the cold.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.625
-Alright!
-And climb into the bath.

00:03:03.208 --> 00:03:05.166
And just let some jerk knock on the door!

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:06.875
Just let him knock!

00:03:10.458 --> 00:03:11.458
What about you?

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.708
I'm going to Rostov.

00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:19.458
-What do you have there?
-Business.

00:03:23.958 --> 00:03:25.083
Some dame again?

00:03:25.833 --> 00:03:28.083
I know you!
Mr. "Beloved by women and children".

00:03:32.333 --> 00:03:33.458
You can't tell me?

00:03:34.083 --> 00:03:37.083
Temperature 23 degrees.
Command issued to open the latch hooks.

00:03:38.583 --> 00:03:39.458
Copy, Cheget!

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:43.875
Latch hooks open.

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:50.583
Controlling the departure
of the TC from its station.

00:03:54.708 --> 00:03:56.750
Initiating full disengagement.

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:03.500
We’ve undocked successfully.
I'm watching the station.

00:04:07.208 --> 00:04:08.083
Copy!

00:04:10.833 --> 00:04:13.833
Well, it'll be like this...
I'll lay there in the bath. I'll get out,

00:04:13.875 --> 00:04:16.083
dry off with a towel.

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:19.583
I'll put on cologne, of course.

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:22.750
We'll dress up nice, wife on my arm,

00:04:23.375 --> 00:04:26.083
and on the 14th we'll head to a concert

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:27.583
at the Zheleznodorozhnik theater.

00:04:28.083 --> 00:04:28.875
There, just for me,

00:04:30.333 --> 00:04:31.416
she'll sing:

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:35.958
"A million, million, million scarlet..."

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:38.333
What was that?

00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:40.458
I don't know. Maybe the utility module?

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:44.333
I don't see anything.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.958
-We're looking out the windows!
-Yes sir.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.208
Oh you stinker!

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.833
Come on, come on, come on!

00:04:57.958 --> 00:04:59.375
Come on, my dear.

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:02.208
Just a little more.

00:05:15.083 --> 00:05:16.208
Well, you don't say!

00:05:34.458 --> 00:05:35.333
Kostya!

00:06:18.333 --> 00:06:22.833
SOVIET KAZAKHSTAN. 1983

00:08:06.458 --> 00:08:12.250
MOSCOW. RESEARCH INSTITUTE OF BRAIN AMS USSR

00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:31.125
How much longer?

00:08:49.333 --> 00:08:50.750
-Hello!
-Hello!

00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:53.750
OK, colleagues. We may begin.

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:01.291
This is a straightforward matter...

00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:03.041
I propose we skip the introductions

00:09:03.083 --> 00:09:04.583
-and move directly to the interview.
-OK.

00:09:05.083 --> 00:09:05.958
I hope you don't mind.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.208
The sooner we finish this
unpleasant business the better, right?

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:13.333
I'm not in a hurry.

00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:16.000
What's that supposed to mean?

00:09:16.833 --> 00:09:18.708
Tatiana Yurievna, we are not your enemies.

00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:21.083
We know your methods.

00:09:21.708 --> 00:09:25.333
No one will accuse you of willfully
inflicting injury on a patient.

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:31.791
But you will have to acknowledge
some degree of negligence.

00:09:31.833 --> 00:09:35.083
Negligence is failure
to fulfill one's duties.

00:09:35.458 --> 00:09:37.916
-I did what was necessary.
-You nearly drowned your patient.

00:09:37.958 --> 00:09:40.000
I temporarily cut the oxygen supply
to his lungs.

00:09:40.583 --> 00:09:41.958
He was improperly diagnosed.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.833
The standard therapy would not
have succeeded.

00:09:44.333 --> 00:09:46.208
You held him underwater
for nearly a minute.

00:09:47.083 --> 00:09:48.208
The boy is seventeen.

00:09:49.708 --> 00:09:52.666
The last two weeks his mother has visited
every office in the Health Ministry.

00:09:52.708 --> 00:09:54.333
Then deal with his mother.

00:09:55.125 --> 00:09:57.875
His psychogenic seizures are rooted
in her overprotection.

00:09:58.458 --> 00:09:59.666
For now I blocked them.

00:09:59.708 --> 00:10:01.958
They will return
if you can't keep her under control.

00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.291
Tatiana Yurievna,
let me explain the situation to you

00:10:05.333 --> 00:10:07.125
so you will have no illusions.

00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:10.250
Now you only have two options.

00:10:10.583 --> 00:10:14.583
Either acknowledge your guilt
and accept dismissal

00:10:14.833 --> 00:10:18.166
or we will be forced to send your file
to the public prosecutor's office.

00:10:18.208 --> 00:10:20.000
The conversation will be
very different there.

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:27.583
I did the right thing.

00:10:45.958 --> 00:10:48.125
Tatiana Yurievna!
Can I have a word with you?

00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:51.083
I answered all your questions
at the inquiry.

00:10:52.708 --> 00:10:55.333
I am not from the Health Ministry.
To the contrary.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.250
My name is Semiradov.
I would like your expert opinion.

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:02.125
You personally?
Or your entire task force?

00:11:02.750 --> 00:11:03.958
It's about a patient.

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:07.458
I must ask you to come with me.

00:11:08.583 --> 00:11:09.958
Bring him here
and I'll give you my opinion.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.833
If you can do so within two weeks,
before I am dismissed.

00:11:13.208 --> 00:11:15.083
I would be glad to, but it's impossible.

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:18.250
I came to ask the mountain
to go to Mohammed.

00:11:18.958 --> 00:11:21.208
Are you asking me? Or is that an order?

00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:22.958
I don't believe in orders.

00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:24.916
It's in the human nature.

00:11:24.958 --> 00:11:29.208
Orders are not effective
for highly intelligent people.

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:31.958
Interesting. Isn't that anti-Soviet?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.208
Possibly. I'm not a politician.
You could say we are colleagues.

00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:38.083
I run something like a research institute.

00:11:39.625 --> 00:11:42.500
I'm also interested in neuropsychiatry.

00:11:43.708 --> 00:11:46.458
I think you will find this case
very interesting.

00:11:47.458 --> 00:11:49.333
Otherwise, I will bring you back.

00:11:50.083 --> 00:11:53.708
Oh, and I will take care
of the review board.

00:11:54.625 --> 00:11:55.833
You have my word as an officer.

00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:11.666
How's the weather?
Any crosswind expected?

00:12:11.708 --> 00:12:14.333
-Nothing serious.
- I know.

00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:16.208
Help yourself!

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:20.333
There'll be no fancy cafeteria
once we land.

00:12:20.375 --> 00:12:23.458
That's the one thing even I can't change.

00:12:24.833 --> 00:12:27.375
I would like to see his medical history,
if it is not classified.

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:31.208
I'm sorry, but we haven't prepared one.

00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:34.958
Would an oral report suffice?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.125
Surely you have heard about
the recent Orbit-4 landing?

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:44.750
I read about it.

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.958
We had to sanitize the media report.

00:12:49.208 --> 00:12:51.958
We lost radio contact with the crew
a day before they landed.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.583
It appears there was an incident in space.

00:12:56.833 --> 00:12:58.791
Our patient is the commanding officer,

00:12:58.833 --> 00:13:00.458
Konstantin Veshnyakov.

00:13:01.083 --> 00:13:02.833
He is suffering from episodic amnesia.

00:13:11.375 --> 00:13:14.250
Do you want me to sign the nondisclosure
agreement now or when we arrive?

00:13:15.208 --> 00:13:16.625
Nondisclosure agreement?

00:13:17.125 --> 00:13:19.750
Apart from the amnesia

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:24.583
and physiological symptoms, suppose
the cosmonaut simply lost his mind.

00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:28.166
The Soviet people probably
don't need to know

00:13:28.208 --> 00:13:30.458
that their national hero
has lost his mind.

00:13:32.208 --> 00:13:33.583
So where is the paper I should sign?

00:13:42.875 --> 00:13:46.708
SOVIET KAZAKHSTAN

00:14:47.625 --> 00:14:51.958
ALL-UNION SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE

00:14:56.583 --> 00:14:59.791
You have access to 90% of the facilities.

00:14:59.833 --> 00:15:01.833
You can move about freely.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.583
After you receive security clearance
you may enter the restricted area.

00:15:36.583 --> 00:15:38.166
At my count,

00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:44.666
with each beat of the metronome

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.541
you will experience a pleasant drowsiness.

00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:58.166
One...

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:01.750
Two...

00:16:04.916 --> 00:16:08.583
You feel a pleasant warmth
spreading through your body.

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:12.416
Can they see us?

00:16:15.166 --> 00:16:16.291
Three...

00:16:17.333 --> 00:16:21.083
Tea? Coffee?
Our staff work non-stop, day and night.

00:16:21.708 --> 00:16:22.875
Four...

00:16:25.708 --> 00:16:27.708
-Tea, thank you!
-Five...

00:16:29.208 --> 00:16:32.250
Everything has become hazy.

00:16:35.791 --> 00:16:37.416
You are on the spaceship.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.041
I’m on the spaceship.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.750
What do you see?

00:16:47.375 --> 00:16:48.500
Something...

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.208
Something huge,

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:54.750
dark blue...

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:01.791
-A whale...
-No.

00:17:03.083 --> 00:17:04.291
No, once more.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:10.666
Tell me your name and rank.

00:17:13.458 --> 00:17:14.375
Robert.

00:17:15.541 --> 00:17:17.500
Duvall... D...

00:17:19.208 --> 00:17:21.041
Field marshal Robert D Duvall.

00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:23.750
Is that a joke?

00:17:31.208 --> 00:17:32.500
Doctor, did I doze off?

00:17:34.541 --> 00:17:36.083
Konstantin Sergeyevich...

00:17:37.833 --> 00:17:41.458
We can’t make progress
if you won’t help me.

00:17:50.125 --> 00:17:53.166
You see, Yan Leonidovich,
only the mentally strong

00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:55.791
are sent into space.

00:17:56.958 --> 00:17:58.625
Unfortunately, I cannot be hypnotized.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.291
This is sabotage.

00:18:04.791 --> 00:18:06.125
I will report you.

00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:15.125
Yan Leonidovich Rigel.
Research Director of our institute.

00:18:15.166 --> 00:18:16.125
Pleased to meet you.

00:18:17.708 --> 00:18:19.000
There’s nothing to be pleased about!

00:18:20.291 --> 00:18:21.208
The situation is despicable.

00:18:23.666 --> 00:18:24.875
Comrade Colonel!

00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:28.291
What happened to Averchenko? Is he alive?

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.083
If I’m guilty, give me a trial.
Otherwise, let me go.

00:18:41.833 --> 00:18:43.000
Do you hear me?

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.125
I’m going on a hunger strike! Understand?

00:18:47.083 --> 00:18:48.250
What do you need from me?

00:18:49.166 --> 00:18:50.583
To begin with,

00:18:51.916 --> 00:18:55.083
I would like to know your opinion
of his condition.

00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:13.583
Look at this!

00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:17.250
Well, isn’t this something new!
Did Semiradov bring in reinforcements?

00:19:18.458 --> 00:19:19.916
I’m Tatiana Yurievna. Good evening!

00:19:21.083 --> 00:19:22.208
The evening certainly is good!

00:19:23.958 --> 00:19:25.083
Comrade Colonel!

00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:27.250
Finally!

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:30.458
Your Rigel makes me almost want
to kill myself.

00:19:36.958 --> 00:19:37.833
Would you like tea?

00:19:39.833 --> 00:19:41.041
Thank you!

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:02.791
I haven’t seen you before.

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:06.750
I just arrived.
I was asked to assess your condition.

00:20:11.875 --> 00:20:12.791
Is that your toy?

00:20:18.666 --> 00:20:21.791
Yes. Mine.
I play with it from time to time.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:25.083
Even in prison
I observe cosmonaut traditions.

00:20:25.416 --> 00:20:27.291
You take personal possessions with you.

00:20:27.666 --> 00:20:28.750
Can you tell me what happened?

00:20:29.083 --> 00:20:29.916
Again?

00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:35.333
First I prepared for spaceflight,
and then we launched.

00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:36.625
I completed my assignment,

00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:39.000
and initiated the landing procedure.

00:20:39.583 --> 00:20:41.416
After that, I can’t remember anything.
I ended up here.

00:20:43.125 --> 00:20:46.125
You can find the details in my testimony
and MCC files. Have you read them?

00:20:46.833 --> 00:20:48.458
Not yet, but I certainly will.

00:20:51.333 --> 00:20:52.416
Tatiana Yurievna.

00:20:53.208 --> 00:20:54.375
Forgive me if I’m wrong.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.083
You don’t make the decisions here.

00:21:00.916 --> 00:21:01.916
No, I don’t.

00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:04.250
And you can’t discharge me.

00:21:07.291 --> 00:21:08.916
No. But possibly I can help you.

00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:14.875
That’s right. I’ll even tell you how.

00:21:16.041 --> 00:21:18.958
Call my mother in Moscow
when you finish here.

00:21:19.541 --> 00:21:24.083
360-73-44. Lidia Sergeyevna.

00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:28.208
When you call,
tell her you’ve seen me and I’m fine.

00:21:29.166 --> 00:21:30.250
She’ll be worried.

00:21:37.583 --> 00:21:38.666
Okay, then.

00:21:40.166 --> 00:21:41.625
You should just go home.

00:21:43.208 --> 00:21:44.500
I feel fine.

00:21:45.125 --> 00:21:46.458
A cosmonaut’s health is always good.

00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:50.000
Don’t worry about me. I managed fine
in space and I’ll manage here too.

00:22:00.708 --> 00:22:01.666
May I?

00:22:05.833 --> 00:22:07.250
It was nice meeting you.

00:22:17.916 --> 00:22:19.541
Are you going to examine him or not?

00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:21.083
I already did.

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:24.375
He has PTSD.

00:22:24.958 --> 00:22:27.000
The tactile sensitivity
in his hands is diminished.

00:22:27.041 --> 00:22:30.125
His sensory receptors or peripheral
nervous system may be damaged.

00:22:30.833 --> 00:22:35.000
But considering you have kept him
prisoner here,

00:22:35.916 --> 00:22:37.166
it’s to be expected.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:40.625
If it were to be expected,
we wouldn’t have put him in isolation.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.125
Well, everyone plays their own games.
Is that all?

00:22:43.958 --> 00:22:45.250
You promised that I could leave.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:47.875
Cosmonauts are not the only ones
who need my help.

00:22:48.666 --> 00:22:49.708
Of course.

00:22:50.083 --> 00:22:51.541
A helicopter leaves in the morning.

00:22:51.583 --> 00:22:53.416
Show Tatiana Yurievna to her room.

00:23:05.291 --> 00:23:07.625
The institute cafeteria offers
three meals a day.

00:23:08.708 --> 00:23:10.833
Good to know. But unnecessary.
I’m here for one night only.

00:23:10.875 --> 00:23:13.708
Comrade Semiradov must
authorize your departure.

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:16.541
-You don’t have an exit pass yet.
-There will be one tomorrow.

00:23:20.541 --> 00:23:21.583
Who are they?

00:23:21.958 --> 00:23:24.250
They are inmates.

00:23:25.083 --> 00:23:26.583
Brought in to do hard labor.

00:23:30.083 --> 00:23:32.375
Room 108. At the end of the hall.

00:23:33.041 --> 00:23:34.916
Do you have a room closer to the stairs?
I get up early.

00:23:35.333 --> 00:23:36.458
You are the only one here.

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.541
How can I help you?

00:24:09.583 --> 00:24:12.416
-I’d like to place a call to Moscow.
-We can only place local calls on base.

00:24:12.458 --> 00:24:14.291
Only Comrade Semiradov has
access to an outside line.

00:24:15.083 --> 00:24:16.375
I see. Thank you.

00:25:53.583 --> 00:25:54.625
Thank you!

00:26:10.458 --> 00:26:11.791
Please, go.

00:26:29.875 --> 00:26:31.833
You’re still awake. Excellent!

00:26:49.833 --> 00:26:51.958
-Has it been long since you had dinner?
-I’m not hungry.

00:26:53.375 --> 00:26:55.125
When was the last time you ate?

00:26:55.166 --> 00:26:56.750
I don’t remember. About 4 hours ago.

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:49.666
Would you like to see it up close?

00:30:25.958 --> 00:30:26.875
What is it?

00:30:28.416 --> 00:30:29.708
I don’t know.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.375
But it’s clearly not terrestrial.

00:30:32.875 --> 00:30:36.458
-It lives in Veshnyakov?
-Yes, but Veshnyakov’s better than ever.

00:30:38.125 --> 00:30:43.208
The creature enters and exits
without harming its carrier.

00:30:44.958 --> 00:30:46.916
-But what does he think?
-He doesn’t have any idea.

00:30:47.333 --> 00:30:48.166
What?

00:30:49.291 --> 00:30:51.750
Try to understand. We don’t know
what exactly happened in space.

00:30:51.791 --> 00:30:56.166
We sent two into orbit,
yet three returned to Earth.

00:30:59.208 --> 00:31:00.416
Where is the other cosmonaut?

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.416
He died.

00:31:04.416 --> 00:31:05.541
How?

00:31:07.708 --> 00:31:08.666
Like a hero.

00:31:12.333 --> 00:31:14.208
I promised you this would interest you.

00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:21.375
My mission is to find out what happened.
Yours...

00:31:21.833 --> 00:31:25.625
...is to find a way
to separate parasite and host.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:31.041
Or, sign the nondisclosure agreement
and return home.

00:31:32.625 --> 00:31:34.958
Why did you entrust this task to me?

00:31:35.416 --> 00:31:38.541
I’ve never worked with your office,
with classified material... Why me?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.125
Because of the boy

00:31:42.541 --> 00:31:44.041
you almost drowned.

00:31:45.541 --> 00:31:47.166
You sought someone
who is ready to take risks?

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.541
Listen, I have no interest in the process.

00:31:52.416 --> 00:31:54.583
Tatiana Yurievna, I need results.

00:31:55.458 --> 00:31:58.166
I found out you saved him.

00:31:58.208 --> 00:32:00.291
The only one who stepped up and saved him.

00:32:02.625 --> 00:32:03.458
Please.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.750
Do it again.

00:32:09.833 --> 00:32:11.750
I need a professional

00:32:12.708 --> 00:32:14.291
who can save a hero.

00:32:20.875 --> 00:32:23.000
I need to see all the videotapes
of the creature

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.500
and Veshnyakov’s testimony on the landing.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.708
All notes and analyses.
Two sessions a day for an hour each.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:46.791
After landing, Veshnyakov was sent
to a rehabilitation facility.

00:32:47.958 --> 00:32:51.583
On the very first night, that creature
emerged and attacked a medical technician.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:54.958
We had to bring him here
for safety reasons.

00:32:55.625 --> 00:32:58.833
So far, we have been unable
to find a safe method to separate them.

00:32:59.166 --> 00:33:02.291
The parasite has succeeded in establishing
a bond with Veshnyakov.

00:33:02.333 --> 00:33:04.416
We tried to remove it.

00:33:04.458 --> 00:33:07.333
But without it,
Veshnyakov’s vital signs deteriorate.

00:33:08.166 --> 00:33:11.583
For it, he’s kind of a spacesuit
against a hostile world.

00:33:13.166 --> 00:33:16.666
At the same time, the creature gives him
a phenomenal capacity for regeneration.

00:33:17.083 --> 00:33:20.916
Veshnyakov was seriously injured during
landing, yet recovered in just two days.

00:33:22.208 --> 00:33:26.333
While incubating, the parasite takes up
just thirty centimeters.

00:33:26.375 --> 00:33:28.458
It fits in his esophagus and stomach,

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.583
increasing the diameter
of the cavities by 30%.

00:33:32.583 --> 00:33:34.250
When it exits,

00:33:34.833 --> 00:33:36.541
it exudes a toxin that relaxes

00:33:36.583 --> 00:33:38.375
Veshnyakov’s muscles and knocks him out.

00:33:40.541 --> 00:33:45.375
It can expand from its tubular form to 1.5
meters in length, once it ingests oxygen.

00:33:45.666 --> 00:33:48.208
Then it coils up and returns.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.916
The length and diameter
of its head constantly changes.

00:33:53.291 --> 00:33:55.833
For now, it resides outside of Veshnyakov

00:33:55.875 --> 00:33:57.625
for about 1 hour and 40 to 50 minutes.

00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:03.083
It exits consistently between
2:40 to 3:10 at night.

00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:09.500
Parasite or symbiote?

00:34:10.875 --> 00:34:12.750
That’s enough, Konstantin Sergeevich!

00:34:13.791 --> 00:34:14.708
I can do more.

00:34:15.583 --> 00:34:19.041
After your injury,
you should take it easy.

00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:25.083
Although the speed of your recovery
has been phenomenal.

00:34:28.333 --> 00:34:30.583
-How do you feel generally?
-Fine.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.041
I have a tickle in my throat.
Probably I caught a cold.

00:34:35.166 --> 00:34:37.083
If it continues to bother you, tell Rigel.

00:34:37.958 --> 00:34:39.041
Okay. See you tomorrow.

00:34:41.625 --> 00:34:44.333
Tired out, guys? Go home!

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:29.916
Can anyone tell me the whereabouts
of Veshnyakov’s son?

00:35:29.958 --> 00:35:33.333
If I'm not mistaken, they lived in Rostov
when the boy’s mother died?

00:35:34.750 --> 00:35:36.250
Is that the only thing you want
to know right now?

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.583
Yesterday did you see clearly
what we’re dealing with?

00:35:40.458 --> 00:35:41.791
What does it feed on?

00:35:45.666 --> 00:35:47.166
The same as what Veshnyakov eats.

00:35:49.375 --> 00:35:51.041
Yan Leonidovich, let’s be clear.

00:35:51.375 --> 00:35:53.041
I’m not after your job.

00:35:53.333 --> 00:35:55.000
Or your Nobel Prize.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:01.166
You have access to the patient,
our analyses, and video recordings.

00:36:01.625 --> 00:36:05.666
If you need anything else,
ask Comrade Semiradov.

00:36:06.833 --> 00:36:08.833
Uh-huh... Alright...

00:36:17.166 --> 00:36:18.291
Hello, is this the orphanage?

00:36:19.291 --> 00:36:22.291
I'm looking for a boy of 7 or 8.
His last name may be Veshnyakov.

00:36:23.458 --> 00:36:24.416
But not necessarily.

00:36:57.666 --> 00:36:58.541
Where are you going?

00:36:58.958 --> 00:37:01.916
Into everything! Oh, this business!

00:37:02.916 --> 00:37:05.041
I leave for a minute, and you run wild!

00:37:06.541 --> 00:37:09.416
If I tell Margarita Mikhailovna,
do you know what she'll do?

00:37:11.583 --> 00:37:13.791
Don't you have anything to say?
I'm talking to you.

00:37:15.333 --> 00:37:16.416
March to your room!

00:37:24.708 --> 00:37:27.541
Friends, I believe caravans of rockets

00:37:28.541 --> 00:37:33.041
Will race us forth from start to star...

00:37:36.083 --> 00:37:37.333
Don't you like my singing?

00:37:39.958 --> 00:37:41.541
I'm sorry, it's for them.

00:37:46.166 --> 00:37:47.458
You know,

00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:51.833
there are no greater fans of space songs
than jaded ground personnel.

00:37:53.291 --> 00:37:55.208
In space we sing other songs.

00:37:55.666 --> 00:37:56.666
Which ones, for example?

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:58.166
Any old nonsense.

00:37:59.166 --> 00:38:00.416
The melody is the important thing.

00:38:01.833 --> 00:38:05.541
A million, million,
million scarlet roses...

00:38:08.666 --> 00:38:11.208
You're drawn to me, right? Admit it.

00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:16.291
You probably asked to come
to the base yourself. Am I right?

00:38:17.416 --> 00:38:20.333
The people who brought me here
think you have lost your mind.

00:38:21.416 --> 00:38:22.708
What do you mean?

00:38:23.666 --> 00:38:25.541
They think you killed
the spaceship co-pilot.

00:38:28.041 --> 00:38:29.083
What is she doing?

00:38:33.041 --> 00:38:35.000
During landing, an event occurred in space

00:38:35.041 --> 00:38:37.791
that led to the death of Averchenko.

00:38:39.416 --> 00:38:41.041
Or, perhaps you killed him.

00:38:41.958 --> 00:38:44.666
You see, Comrade Semiradov can't
let a hero who's insane

00:38:44.708 --> 00:38:46.708
go free into society.

00:38:48.833 --> 00:38:49.666
Perfect.

00:38:50.583 --> 00:38:54.625
So, it seems I'm a murderer and insane.

00:38:54.666 --> 00:38:57.166
Surely you know
not all crazy people look crazy.

00:38:57.833 --> 00:39:01.291
Listen, doctor!
You're a sensible person.

00:39:01.708 --> 00:39:03.291
I prepared for this flight for years.

00:39:03.666 --> 00:39:05.458
Something went wrong,
and I don't remember what exactly.

00:39:06.541 --> 00:39:10.208
And that's why they put me
behind armored glass.

00:39:12.166 --> 00:39:13.916
Can you tell me
why are they're holding me here?

00:39:15.416 --> 00:39:16.833
Can anyone explain?

00:39:17.916 --> 00:39:19.083
I'm not a spy

00:39:19.666 --> 00:39:21.250
-or a wild animal!
-But who are you?

00:39:21.291 --> 00:39:22.291
What do you mean?

00:39:22.583 --> 00:39:26.041
Well, Konstantin Sergeevich Veshnyakov...
Who are you?

00:39:26.583 --> 00:39:29.833
Read my file.
I'm a hero of the Soviet Union.

00:39:31.583 --> 00:39:32.666
I could never understand.

00:39:33.083 --> 00:39:34.875
A grenade attack on a tank is one thing,

00:39:34.916 --> 00:39:37.666
but you sat in a tin can

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:39.791
at the expense of the government
for a few weeks.

00:39:40.666 --> 00:39:41.791
What's heroic about that?

00:39:42.916 --> 00:39:43.750
What are you saying?

00:39:43.791 --> 00:39:45.041
By the way, about your file...

00:39:45.666 --> 00:39:47.458
Why did you abandon your son?

00:39:50.041 --> 00:39:51.041
Let's be clear.

00:39:52.791 --> 00:39:54.666
You never married
the mother of your child.

00:39:55.958 --> 00:39:58.208
After her death,
you could have adopted him.

00:39:58.708 --> 00:40:02.041
But you wanted
to be a part of a space crew!

00:40:03.041 --> 00:40:07.041
An illegitimate son could blemish
your otherwise perfect reputation.

00:40:07.833 --> 00:40:10.041
This is why the boy lives in an orphanage
near Rostov.

00:40:10.416 --> 00:40:11.333
Am I right?

00:40:13.416 --> 00:40:14.916
I also grew up without a father, so what?

00:40:16.333 --> 00:40:17.666
Did it prevent me from becoming a hero?

00:40:18.541 --> 00:40:20.083
Heroes don't abandon their children.

00:40:29.708 --> 00:40:32.916
You know what, Tatiana Yurievna?

00:40:34.458 --> 00:40:36.583
I like your pretty face.

00:40:37.916 --> 00:40:40.041
But from now on,
I prefer that idiot Rigel.

00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:42.291
Thank you, the session is over.

00:40:55.833 --> 00:40:56.791
Have you lost your mind?

00:40:56.833 --> 00:40:58.875
What the hell were you saying in there?
Who gave you the right?

00:40:58.916 --> 00:41:01.166
Test his endocrine profile. Do it now.

00:41:01.833 --> 00:41:02.750
Do it!

00:41:02.791 --> 00:41:05.333
Yesterday I thought
his reactions were a bit too slow.

00:41:05.666 --> 00:41:07.500
It could be his hormone levels.

00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:10.875
This can be tested
after a severe psychological stress.

00:41:10.916 --> 00:41:13.083
The glands empty into the blood stream.

00:41:13.458 --> 00:41:15.500
The results of today's tests will show

00:41:15.541 --> 00:41:17.666
how and what the creature
inside of him feeds on.

00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:18.833
Even if it's like photosynthesis!

00:41:19.291 --> 00:41:22.125
This has no relation to our mission.

00:41:22.166 --> 00:41:24.250
We need to remove the parasite.

00:41:24.291 --> 00:41:25.083
Comrade Semiradov.

00:41:25.458 --> 00:41:27.666
Please order Comrade Veshnyakov
to be transferred

00:41:27.708 --> 00:41:29.375
to the medical unit during daylight hours

00:41:29.416 --> 00:41:31.833
and allow him to associate with civilians.

00:41:32.791 --> 00:41:34.666
We should attempt
to recreate his normal life

00:41:34.708 --> 00:41:37.291
to obtain a realistic clinical picture.

00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:41.458
"Please order!"

00:42:08.458 --> 00:42:09.416
What is this?

00:42:10.291 --> 00:42:11.708
A reward for good behavior?

00:43:17.041 --> 00:43:19.291
We wanted to help you...

00:43:20.083 --> 00:43:23.500
The Cuban representatives confirmed
the meeting took place as anticipated.

00:43:23.541 --> 00:43:26.291
They expressed their gratitude
to Secretary General of the CPSU,

00:43:26.333 --> 00:43:29.250
Chairman of the Presidium
of the Supreme Council of the USSR,

00:43:29.291 --> 00:43:34.291
Yuri Andropov and the entire Soviet
nation for their hospitality.

00:43:34.541 --> 00:43:39.291
The Soviet people were equally excited
to welcome back our cosmonauts from orbit.

00:43:39.583 --> 00:43:44.166
At last, Kirill Averchenko and Konstantin
Veshnyakov have landed safely.

00:43:45.166 --> 00:43:47.916
The heroes are in a rehabilitation center

00:43:48.166 --> 00:43:52.416
where they will recover
from their long stay in weightlessness.

00:43:52.458 --> 00:43:55.458
In approximately three weeks,

00:43:55.916 --> 00:43:58.083
the world will welcome the heroes home.

00:43:58.708 --> 00:44:00.083
In brief...

00:44:00.541 --> 00:44:03.125
All-Union competitions
between the country's strongest skaters

00:44:03.166 --> 00:44:04.666
concluded in Alma-Ata...

00:44:13.291 --> 00:44:14.666
What are you doing here?

00:44:15.791 --> 00:44:17.208
I owe you an apology.

00:44:17.916 --> 00:44:21.416
I provoked you intentionally to measure
your hormone levels under stress.

00:44:33.208 --> 00:44:34.791
Okay then,
I'll see you at tomorrow's session.

00:44:35.666 --> 00:44:36.458
Goodbye until then.

00:44:38.083 --> 00:44:39.541
I didn't know about the child.

00:44:40.791 --> 00:44:41.791
She never told me.

00:44:44.541 --> 00:44:45.791
A week before the flight,
they called me

00:44:47.166 --> 00:44:48.541
from Rostov. She had died.

00:44:48.583 --> 00:44:50.541
The little guy has no other relatives.

00:44:50.583 --> 00:44:53.541
He's in an orphanage.
They didn't even tell me his name.

00:44:55.541 --> 00:44:56.333
I thought,

00:44:58.291 --> 00:45:00.791
when I return, I'll go get him. Or...

00:45:02.541 --> 00:45:03.916
... maybe I didn't think anything at all.

00:45:06.291 --> 00:45:07.666
What would you have done in my place?

00:45:09.333 --> 00:45:11.583
I don't know. I don't have children.

00:45:19.083 --> 00:45:20.666
Tatiana, tell me why you're here.

00:45:22.916 --> 00:45:24.416
Not to cure me of amnesia.

00:45:26.041 --> 00:45:27.291
What do they want from me?

00:45:31.916 --> 00:45:33.416
You can't say or won't?

00:45:35.333 --> 00:45:36.208
I can't.

00:45:39.416 --> 00:45:41.208
But I'll do all I can to help you.

00:45:44.958 --> 00:45:46.416
Do you think you can help me?

00:46:13.583 --> 00:46:14.958
Try moving closer.

00:46:16.541 --> 00:46:19.041
Try not to say anything
while I'm working.

00:46:20.208 --> 00:46:23.666
Don't worry! We already confirmed
it has no auditory receptors.

00:46:24.666 --> 00:46:25.666
But I do.

00:47:01.416 --> 00:47:02.291
What are you doing?

00:48:08.541 --> 00:48:10.458
Tatiana Yurievna, what are you doing?

00:48:12.041 --> 00:48:13.541
Is this thing even working?

00:48:15.416 --> 00:48:18.041
-Tatiana Yurievna, what are you doing?
-Can you wait a minute!

00:48:43.166 --> 00:48:45.958
-Well, then. If you're finished...
-Raise the glass.

00:48:47.708 --> 00:48:48.583
What?

00:48:49.583 --> 00:48:50.791
Raise it!

00:48:58.291 --> 00:48:59.166
Are you certain?

00:49:00.583 --> 00:49:01.416
Yes.

00:49:01.916 --> 00:49:03.208
No! It's too...

00:49:05.583 --> 00:49:06.708
Then put on a protective suit.

00:51:14.166 --> 00:51:15.041
Get her out of there!

00:52:36.416 --> 00:52:38.708
We have a shortage
of flower shops around here.

00:52:39.166 --> 00:52:41.583
I picked what I could.

00:52:42.041 --> 00:52:44.416
-How do you feel?
-I'm fine. Thank you!

00:52:46.208 --> 00:52:48.041
You are truly a brave lady.

00:52:48.916 --> 00:52:51.583
Now at least we know what not to do.

00:52:53.208 --> 00:52:55.041
Veshnyakov isn't fully unconscious.

00:52:55.958 --> 00:52:56.791
I see...

00:52:57.416 --> 00:52:59.458
Can you be more specific?

00:53:00.791 --> 00:53:02.166
That toy reminds him

00:53:02.541 --> 00:53:05.041
of the guilt he feels towards his son.

00:53:05.666 --> 00:53:07.625
Do you mean the creature

00:53:07.666 --> 00:53:11.291
reacted to the toy
because it means a lot to Veshnyakov?

00:53:11.833 --> 00:53:14.666
I mean the creature
and Veshnyakov are a single entity.

00:53:14.916 --> 00:53:16.208
They share the same conscious mind.

00:53:17.041 --> 00:53:20.958
The creature partially blunts
his memories and social skills.

00:53:21.333 --> 00:53:23.750
Every night it spends
a few more minutes longer

00:53:23.791 --> 00:53:25.291
outside Veshnyakov's body.

00:53:25.541 --> 00:53:28.291
At some point it will no longer need him
like a butterfly sheds its cocoon.

00:53:28.333 --> 00:53:29.541
We have to do something.

00:53:29.916 --> 00:53:31.375
We need more resources.

00:53:31.416 --> 00:53:32.875
He must be taken to Moscow.

00:53:32.916 --> 00:53:33.833
To Moscow?

00:53:34.916 --> 00:53:38.916
Tatiana Yurievna,
why do you think we're not there now?

00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:42.458
We know nothing about this creature:

00:53:43.583 --> 00:53:46.041
whether it's a grown specimen

00:53:46.083 --> 00:53:47.958
or a nymph that might grow

00:53:48.333 --> 00:53:52.083
into something that dwarfs us.

00:53:52.916 --> 00:53:54.791
I am obliged to preserve
the ability to destroy it,

00:53:54.833 --> 00:53:56.916
if it becomes uncontrollable.

00:53:57.166 --> 00:53:58.875
We are risking the life of a human being.

00:53:58.916 --> 00:54:00.625
A cosmonaut.
A hero of the Soviet Union.

00:54:00.666 --> 00:54:01.916
A hero

00:54:02.416 --> 00:54:03.958
is prepared for anything.

00:54:05.083 --> 00:54:07.125
Including self-sacrifice.

00:54:07.166 --> 00:54:10.875
Every day I send fake reports
on our accomplishments

00:54:10.916 --> 00:54:11.958
to Moscow.

00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:13.666
What he eats.

00:54:14.083 --> 00:54:17.166
Details of his pulse, feces, mood.
Anything I can make up.

00:54:18.041 --> 00:54:21.791
To avoid the order to destroy him.

00:54:22.833 --> 00:54:24.916
I should be court-martialed already.

00:54:27.541 --> 00:54:30.416
I hoped you were also ready
to do anything.

00:54:40.583 --> 00:54:41.666
May I?

00:55:05.458 --> 00:55:07.208
-Yan Leonidovich!
-What?

00:55:07.958 --> 00:55:09.041
Doesn't this alarm you?

00:55:14.041 --> 00:55:15.416
Maybe there's been a technical mistake?

00:55:18.458 --> 00:55:20.750
Veshnyakov's hormone levels

00:55:20.791 --> 00:55:23.041
are radically different
at morning and night.

00:55:23.541 --> 00:55:25.458
At night he appears to get much worse.

00:55:26.083 --> 00:55:28.291
I keep wondering,
when does he get that boost?

00:55:31.041 --> 00:55:33.208
I'm not an endocrinologist,
Tatiana Yurievna.

00:55:34.208 --> 00:55:36.250
Do your work and figure it out.

00:55:36.291 --> 00:55:37.416
You edited parts of the videotapes.

00:55:39.083 --> 00:55:41.666
Don't tell me this creature eats
what Veshnyakov does.

00:55:42.041 --> 00:55:43.666
What are you feeding it? Pigs?

00:55:44.916 --> 00:55:46.250
If I'm leading an investigation,

00:55:46.291 --> 00:55:47.958
why is everything hidden from me?

00:55:49.291 --> 00:55:50.583
Isn't that enough for you?

00:55:53.541 --> 00:55:54.666
Do you want my advice?

00:55:56.166 --> 00:55:58.291
Go back to Moscow while you still can.

00:55:58.583 --> 00:56:00.083
Forget what you've seen here.

00:56:01.083 --> 00:56:02.875
When the review board comes,
we'll all be reported.

00:56:02.916 --> 00:56:04.666
Will you torture him with hypnosis
for the review board?

00:56:06.166 --> 00:56:08.708
I know what's keeping you here!
You want a Nobel Prize.

00:56:11.541 --> 00:56:13.291
You won't make any progress without me.

00:56:14.833 --> 00:56:17.583
To do so, I need access
to all the information.

00:56:20.833 --> 00:56:23.416
There is no need
for Comrade Semiradov to know.

00:56:57.416 --> 00:56:58.416
What, are you serious?

00:57:21.208 --> 00:57:22.208
Open the gates!

00:57:24.041 --> 00:57:25.041
Open the gates!

00:58:10.583 --> 00:58:11.833
Don't waste your chance.

00:58:12.333 --> 00:58:14.708
The battery lasts
for only about ten minutes.

00:58:42.666 --> 00:58:45.666
Where are you taking me? Why am I here?

00:59:03.166 --> 00:59:04.041
No!

00:59:04.083 --> 00:59:04.916
No!

00:59:06.083 --> 00:59:07.166
Don't!

00:59:23.583 --> 00:59:24.458
Light!

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.041
Stop the camera!

01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:49.458
Before he was brought here,

01:01:50.291 --> 01:01:51.833
the creature attacked a medic.

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:54.208
You saw the video...

01:01:55.458 --> 01:01:57.958
...but you didn't see
Veshnyakov's vital signs.

01:01:58.958 --> 01:02:01.708
His condition immediately
improved after the murder.

01:02:02.291 --> 01:02:03.958
We tried feeding it everything -

01:02:04.208 --> 01:02:05.708
from lab rats

01:02:07.833 --> 01:02:09.083
to pigs.

01:02:09.916 --> 01:02:10.708
And then

01:02:11.041 --> 01:02:15.541
Semiradov ordered that one convict be sent
into the enclosure.

01:02:17.291 --> 01:02:18.916
Veshnyakov's hormone levels improved.

01:02:19.708 --> 01:02:22.041
You got me thinking about hormones...

01:02:23.083 --> 01:02:24.708
Did you see how it behaves
in the enclosure?

01:02:26.583 --> 01:02:28.083
It doesn't just need to kill.

01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:32.291
It's important for the victim to see it

01:02:33.791 --> 01:02:34.833
and become afraid.

01:02:37.041 --> 01:02:41.333
The highly developed human brain
releases a lot of cortisol when afraid.

01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:45.333
On this planet, we are the champions

01:02:46.291 --> 01:02:48.166
when it comes to fear.

01:02:51.166 --> 01:02:52.333
This creature

01:02:53.541 --> 01:02:55.333
essentially feeds on cortisol.

01:03:02.916 --> 01:03:04.583
We are on the edge of a great discovery!

01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:08.916
If we combine forces...

01:03:08.958 --> 01:03:10.208
Rigel! You're killing people.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:16.208
Not me,

01:03:16.958 --> 01:03:18.458
this is all Semiradov's doing.

01:03:20.166 --> 01:03:21.708
What, do you think I'm a monster?

01:03:22.166 --> 01:03:23.583
You're not a monster, you're a coward.

01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:26.958
A highly adaptive and hardy specimen.

01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:39.666
You can't stay here any longer.

01:03:39.708 --> 01:03:41.875
It's a terrible place.
They're gonna kill you.

01:03:41.916 --> 01:03:43.041
Let's go.

01:03:43.083 --> 01:03:45.166
I can't.

01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:47.791
-Go to Astra.
-Listen to me.

01:03:48.208 --> 01:03:49.458
You are not a robot, but a human being.

01:03:49.708 --> 01:03:51.458
Don't you understand?

01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:53.708
Let’s go.

01:03:54.708 --> 01:03:55.583
Good morning!

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:57.208
Morning!

01:03:59.208 --> 01:04:01.666
To be honest, I prefer war films.

01:04:01.958 --> 01:04:03.208
Or ones about spies.

01:04:04.833 --> 01:04:05.958
What movies do you like?

01:04:07.083 --> 01:04:09.208
Don't you need to get back
in shape after your injury?

01:04:09.458 --> 01:04:10.583
Want to go for a run?

01:04:14.708 --> 01:04:16.791
What, are we going to run
around in a circle, like gym class?

01:04:16.833 --> 01:04:18.458
We'll push the TV into the corner.

01:04:20.208 --> 01:04:21.708
I received permission
to exit the compound.

01:04:33.458 --> 01:04:34.958
You look good in sports clothes!

01:04:35.583 --> 01:04:37.083
Did you ever think to try track and field?

01:04:37.958 --> 01:04:38.833
No.

01:04:39.333 --> 01:04:41.208
We should try when I'm released.

01:04:42.083 --> 01:04:43.833
We can no longer
compete professionally,

01:04:44.458 --> 01:04:45.958
but why not try amateur sports!

01:04:47.583 --> 01:04:49.250
Listen to me carefully!

01:04:49.291 --> 01:04:51.916
You brought back a passenger
from outer space. It's inside of you.

01:04:52.333 --> 01:04:53.708
They feed people to it alive.

01:04:54.916 --> 01:04:56.166
We can separate you from it,

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:58.583
but we have to find someone
who can inform the government!

01:05:07.583 --> 01:05:08.708
Can you hear me?

01:05:15.583 --> 01:05:17.166
-Are you being watched?
-I don't know.

01:05:17.541 --> 01:05:20.166
-At night? Did they assign you a guard?
-I don't know.

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:22.333
Find out!
If not, meet me at 1 AM in my block.

01:05:24.833 --> 01:05:25.916
That's all, Dr.

01:05:26.416 --> 01:05:27.416
I'm exhausted.

01:05:28.208 --> 01:05:29.208
Time to sleep!

01:06:16.208 --> 01:06:17.333
You also can't sleep?

01:06:19.083 --> 01:06:20.333
You're not allowed in the hallway.

01:06:21.666 --> 01:06:22.583
I know.

01:06:25.041 --> 01:06:26.208
What a life, right?

01:06:26.833 --> 01:06:29.833
I can go into space,
but not into the hallway.

01:06:34.041 --> 01:06:35.083
Konstantin Sergeevich.

01:06:37.083 --> 01:06:39.208
What do you think,

01:06:40.541 --> 01:06:42.958
-is anyone out there?
-Where?

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:44.583
In the sky.

01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:46.458
Do you believe in God?

01:06:49.541 --> 01:06:50.958
I believe in what I can see.

01:06:52.208 --> 01:06:53.083
I didn't see God there.

01:06:58.333 --> 01:06:59.208
You know what?

01:07:00.083 --> 01:07:01.166
I say it's your break time.

01:07:02.583 --> 01:07:03.833
Come watch a movie.

01:07:04.208 --> 01:07:06.916
They gave me a VCR,
but it's boring to watch alone.

01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:08.291
I'm not allowed.

01:07:08.333 --> 01:07:09.291
Come on!

01:07:09.833 --> 01:07:11.333
Konstantin Sergeevich, I'm not allowed!

01:07:15.083 --> 01:07:18.708
And the entire planet will enjoy
the pure air!

01:07:19.208 --> 01:07:20.416
Come on.

01:07:30.333 --> 01:07:31.833
What's wrong?

01:07:33.916 --> 01:07:35.583
-I'll stay by your side.
-I am all alone.

01:07:36.583 --> 01:07:38.333
-That's not true.
-I am all alone.

01:07:39.458 --> 01:07:41.208
I was produced to no purpose.

01:08:29.708 --> 01:08:30.791
I don't get it...

01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:28.708
Amusing, right?

01:10:32.083 --> 01:10:34.708
My whole life I dreamed of having
my legacy displayed in a museum.

01:10:42.833 --> 01:10:44.416
Can you feel what that creature feels?

01:10:46.333 --> 01:10:47.583
I am that creature.

01:10:48.708 --> 01:10:52.041
Without morals or obligations.

01:10:55.791 --> 01:10:57.541
I feel everything it does.

01:10:58.958 --> 01:11:00.416
I remember everything in minute detail.

01:11:03.583 --> 01:11:05.416
Everything it sees, stays with me.

01:11:07.916 --> 01:11:09.708
You knew from the beginning!
Why didn't you say?

01:11:10.416 --> 01:11:11.583
Why do you think?

01:11:13.833 --> 01:11:15.333
If Semiradov knew,

01:11:16.708 --> 01:11:18.083
he'd never let me go.

01:11:38.583 --> 01:11:40.083
My co-pilot Comrade Averchenko.

01:11:46.833 --> 01:11:48.041
Help me, Tanya!

01:11:49.833 --> 01:11:51.541
To hold on just two more weeks.

01:11:54.083 --> 01:11:55.583
Just continue on as you have been.

01:11:56.833 --> 01:11:58.208
Semiradov will have no choice.

01:12:00.333 --> 01:12:02.708
A review board will arrive from Moscow.
We'll be released.

01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:05.208
But before then,
he should not know that I...

01:12:09.541 --> 01:12:10.916
I don't want to end up like him.

01:12:14.041 --> 01:12:16.583
It will kill people for two more weeks.

01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:19.416
How can you endure that!

01:12:20.791 --> 01:12:22.458
What would you have done in my place?

01:12:22.958 --> 01:12:24.333
Smashed your head in against the wall?

01:12:25.458 --> 01:12:26.291
Yes!

01:12:27.333 --> 01:12:29.791
I didn't decide to feed it people.

01:12:30.833 --> 01:12:32.833
I can't be responsible for that.

01:12:34.208 --> 01:12:36.958
I haven't endured so much,
just to die out here in the steppe.

01:12:39.041 --> 01:12:40.333
My mother lives alone

01:12:41.416 --> 01:12:42.708
and I need to get home.

01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:44.458
I must survive.

01:12:46.208 --> 01:12:47.458
I need to collect my son.

01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:53.708
Now I understand why that creature
chose you and not Averchenko!

01:12:55.208 --> 01:12:56.541
You mean I'm a monster?

01:12:57.416 --> 01:12:59.916
And you, a princess?

01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:03.791
While you all sat cozy and warm
in your offices,

01:13:04.333 --> 01:13:07.666
I prepared for this flight,
a heroic accomplishment.

01:13:08.708 --> 01:13:10.958
And now you all tell me I should die.

01:13:15.583 --> 01:13:16.708
It's your dinner time.

01:13:58.708 --> 01:14:02.083
Where are you going? Such a pain!
You haven't killed yourself yet?

01:14:02.458 --> 01:14:03.708
Give it to me.

01:14:05.166 --> 01:14:08.791
You saw it, huh?
He is like a little animal.

01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:10.916
I don't seem to remember this one.
He's from which group?

01:14:10.958 --> 01:14:12.708
The invalid group.
Just take a look at his feet!

01:14:13.958 --> 01:14:15.208
This one's a nutcase.

01:14:15.708 --> 01:14:17.083
Look, he scratched me to blood.

01:14:36.708 --> 01:14:37.625
Comrade Colonel.

01:14:38.666 --> 01:14:39.625
You may go!

01:14:44.875 --> 01:14:47.625
You and I, Tatiana Yurievna, never got off
to a good start.

01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:50.916
I should have told you everything.

01:14:51.708 --> 01:14:52.625
What in particular?

01:14:53.500 --> 01:14:55.166
That you feed people
to that creature alive?

01:14:55.208 --> 01:14:58.958
We don't know how much
that creature will adapt.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.041
The victor will be the one
who can control it.

01:15:03.208 --> 01:15:05.291
We must learn to control it.

01:15:05.333 --> 01:15:07.416
Is that the only thing you care about?
Weapons?

01:15:08.666 --> 01:15:09.500
Yes.

01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:15.000
Do you know why we need weapons?

01:15:17.541 --> 01:15:19.291
Weapons guarantee peace.

01:15:19.875 --> 01:15:22.833
A pack of dogs would tear
each other to pieces.

01:15:23.291 --> 01:15:25.875
In order to live in peace,
they need one leader.

01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:28.458
You feed it people.

01:15:29.250 --> 01:15:30.333
People...

01:15:41.458 --> 01:15:44.333
Sergey Gennadievich Kovalyev.
Born in 1952.

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:47.291
Convicted by law 103, 117,

01:15:47.333 --> 01:15:48.916
77 part one.

01:15:49.333 --> 01:15:51.333
He raped and killed his neighbor,

01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:53.125
a 12-year-old girl.

01:15:53.166 --> 01:15:54.458
These are not people!

01:15:54.750 --> 01:15:58.083
People are those who died in Angola
and who die in Afghanistan now.

01:15:58.125 --> 01:15:59.000
These are fodder!

01:16:00.583 --> 01:16:03.000
If the authorities find out,
they'll court-martial you.

01:16:06.333 --> 01:16:08.625
Yes.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.583
We don't like initiative.

01:16:12.208 --> 01:16:15.625
But doctors and soldiers sometimes
must make difficult decisions.

01:16:16.416 --> 01:16:18.875
Victors are not judged.

01:16:20.083 --> 01:16:21.666
I'm ready to take responsibility.

01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:26.083
You're the same, Tatiana.

01:16:26.458 --> 01:16:27.375
You don't know me.

01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:28.458
You...

01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.291
You don't know yourself.

01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:33.333
Come on, I'll show you
the feeding up close.

01:16:33.833 --> 01:16:36.708
No need to sit in the back
of a car with binoculars.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000
Comrade Semiradov.

01:17:00.666 --> 01:17:02.583
She allowed herself to go too far.

01:17:02.625 --> 01:17:04.833
But it was for the greater good.

01:17:04.875 --> 01:17:07.750
Yan Leonidovich, doesn't your conscience
trouble you at night?

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:09.791
M...me?

01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:11.666
You showed her the feeding session.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000
You disobeyed an order.

01:18:04.208 --> 01:18:05.208
Please, don't!

01:18:06.083 --> 01:18:07.291
I'll find another way.

01:18:08.833 --> 01:18:10.875
In the short term, unlikely.

01:18:23.125 --> 01:18:24.041
Open up!

01:18:44.333 --> 01:18:47.000
I'm not afraid...

01:18:53.416 --> 01:18:54.333
It's me.

01:19:00.916 --> 01:19:01.791
It's me.

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:13.583
A million, million, million scarlet roses

01:19:15.875 --> 01:19:19.333
From the window, from the window you see

01:19:28.833 --> 01:19:30.416
Who's in love, who's in love

01:19:37.291 --> 01:19:38.791
A million

01:19:40.666 --> 01:19:42.833
A million scarlet roses

01:19:45.291 --> 01:19:47.166
From the window, from the window...

01:19:49.125 --> 01:19:50.541
It adapted.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:55.833
Now it can hear.

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:02.958
He transformed his life into flowers

01:20:03.791 --> 01:20:04.708
For you

01:20:10.833 --> 01:20:15.208
Who's in love, who's in love deeply...

01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:41.666
No!

01:21:07.833 --> 01:21:10.416
Can Veshnyakov control it?

01:21:15.541 --> 01:21:16.375
No.

01:21:18.958 --> 01:21:19.833
Not yet.

01:21:25.916 --> 01:21:27.583
I need results, Tatiana Yurievna.

01:21:29.541 --> 01:21:31.833
You must learn to control him.

01:21:32.541 --> 01:21:34.458
That will be difficult without you.

01:21:35.416 --> 01:21:37.875
Let's forget our differences

01:21:37.916 --> 01:21:41.166
and work together openly.

01:21:42.083 --> 01:21:43.583
I take full responsibility.

01:21:44.208 --> 01:21:46.416
You can say that I forced you.

01:21:48.541 --> 01:21:50.958
If things go well,
we'll have an amazing weapon.

01:21:52.583 --> 01:21:53.500
Will you help?

01:22:06.625 --> 01:22:07.833
Tatiana Yurievna!

01:22:08.875 --> 01:22:11.125
Do you know why it chose Veshnyakov,
and not Averchenko?

01:22:16.458 --> 01:22:17.791
He was in the early stages of cancer.

01:22:18.500 --> 01:22:21.250
With a kidney tumor
that caused Addison's disease.

01:22:22.125 --> 01:22:25.166
We couldn't detect it prior to lift-off.
But the creature could.

01:22:25.916 --> 01:22:29.500
His body suppressed
high concentrations of cortisol.

01:22:29.541 --> 01:22:32.750
That's why it couldn't establish
a complete symbiotic bond.

01:22:35.041 --> 01:22:35.875
Come here.

01:22:40.541 --> 01:22:42.291
Metyrapone and Trilostane,
four milliliters...

01:22:42.875 --> 01:22:45.708
And some strong sedative.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:48.041
At 2 AM. By the medical unit.

01:22:49.958 --> 01:22:51.125
Trilostane?

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.458
Tonight.
We will attempt an escape. With you.

01:22:58.875 --> 01:22:59.958
Not me.

01:23:00.833 --> 01:23:02.625
Be a man, after all.

01:23:02.958 --> 01:23:04.291
You're a scientist, not any old doctor.

01:23:05.708 --> 01:23:06.541
Look here.

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:08.458
See the tongue?

01:23:10.625 --> 01:23:11.750
Don't be afraid, Comrade Rigel.

01:23:12.333 --> 01:23:13.166
Help us.

01:23:31.583 --> 01:23:34.958
If you escape, say he made me do it.

01:23:37.291 --> 01:23:39.708
Or if you don't, that I didn't know.

01:23:43.041 --> 01:23:44.916
Thank you, colleague.
You helped me a lot.

01:23:51.833 --> 01:23:53.625
Are you allergic to Buspironum?

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.166
Me? I don't think so...

01:23:56.083 --> 01:23:57.708
You... What...

01:23:58.375 --> 01:23:59.250
What are you doing?

01:24:04.125 --> 01:24:05.833
Make up your mind, Comrade Rigel.

01:24:05.875 --> 01:24:07.250
You didn't know or you were forced?

01:24:16.958 --> 01:24:18.125
Watch the door.

01:24:29.125 --> 01:24:30.166
We have little time,

01:24:30.625 --> 01:24:31.791
so listen carefully.

01:24:32.250 --> 01:24:33.750
No review board is coming here.

01:24:34.208 --> 01:24:36.375
Semiradov will do anything
to keep that creature here.

01:24:37.958 --> 01:24:39.541
I know how to separate you.

01:24:39.791 --> 01:24:41.250
Why did you enter the enclosure?

01:24:41.875 --> 01:24:42.958
I could have killed you.

01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:46.166
But you didn't. You like me too.

01:24:48.875 --> 01:24:50.125
This is a mix of hormones.

01:24:50.583 --> 01:24:53.708
It will imitate the effects of Addison's
disease, which Averchenko suffered from.

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.875
The injection will force
the creature to exit you.

01:24:58.375 --> 01:25:00.125
Without you,
it can live no more than an hour.

01:25:00.416 --> 01:25:02.916
You'll survive much longer. We just
need to make it to an emergency room.

01:25:05.250 --> 01:25:06.333
And if you are wrong?

01:25:07.583 --> 01:25:09.125
If it's already acclimatized?

01:25:10.375 --> 01:25:11.625
We'll be letting it go free!

01:25:13.125 --> 01:25:14.958
We'll give you a shot,
when we get a safe distance away.

01:25:15.333 --> 01:25:18.083
Where there's no people.
It's weaker in the sunlight.

01:25:21.083 --> 01:25:21.916
No.

01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:27.541
No.

01:25:33.958 --> 01:25:35.458
We just need
to make it to a real hospital.

01:25:37.791 --> 01:25:39.000
I'll be able to think of something.

01:25:39.875 --> 01:25:40.791
I'll find a way out of this.

01:25:43.291 --> 01:25:44.125
Why?

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:48.041
Tatiana, you don't understand.

01:25:49.125 --> 01:25:50.875
I don't need to be taken anywhere.

01:25:52.041 --> 01:25:53.791
The creature doesn't harm me at all.

01:25:54.625 --> 01:25:55.875
To the contrary, it saved my life.

01:25:56.833 --> 01:25:57.875
You don't believe that.

01:26:02.416 --> 01:26:03.250
Leave already!

01:26:09.583 --> 01:26:10.458
I'm not afraid of them!

01:26:11.125 --> 01:26:13.708
Be afraid of me! It chose me!

01:26:14.166 --> 01:26:15.000
It is not you.

01:26:25.916 --> 01:26:26.750
It's me!

01:26:30.208 --> 01:26:31.458
It's my punishment!

01:26:33.125 --> 01:26:34.208
I abandoned my son.

01:26:35.916 --> 01:26:37.458
I chose space instead.

01:26:39.416 --> 01:26:40.666
I deserve this, you understand?

01:26:42.708 --> 01:26:43.541
That's all. Go!

01:26:46.291 --> 01:26:47.208
Lyosha!

01:26:50.041 --> 01:26:50.875
What?

01:26:52.083 --> 01:26:53.166
His name is Lyosha.

01:26:56.666 --> 01:26:58.250
Aleksei Konstantinovich Romanov.

01:27:05.208 --> 01:27:06.458
He'll be seven next week.

01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:35.041
There's a car by the enclosure.

01:27:35.875 --> 01:27:37.333
They'll kill you here. Come with us.

01:27:38.125 --> 01:27:41.416
Don't worry. I'm a highly adaptive

01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:44.166
and hardy specimen.

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:50.916
Thank you!

01:28:29.166 --> 01:28:30.958
This Dr. Rigel, from Base ALFA 4.

01:28:32.083 --> 01:28:34.541
Please, connect me
to the operative on duty.

01:28:34.583 --> 01:28:36.500
I have very important information.

01:28:39.166 --> 01:28:40.583
-What is it?
-They're in the enclosure.

01:28:41.333 --> 01:28:42.791
Veshnyakov and Dr. Klimova.

01:28:45.708 --> 01:28:47.208
Send the response team.

01:28:47.250 --> 01:28:50.083
Do not shoot Veshnyakov. Terminate her.

01:28:58.833 --> 01:28:59.791
Stop!

01:29:03.541 --> 01:29:05.833
Veshnyakov!
Take two steps to the right! Lie down!

01:29:08.125 --> 01:29:10.666
Drop your weapons
and no one will get hurt!

01:29:14.416 --> 01:29:15.750
-Don't shoot!
-Fire!

01:29:18.125 --> 01:29:21.916
And he... he ordered
they be listed as victims of a fire.

01:29:31.125 --> 01:29:32.916
But those people were killed outright.

01:29:32.958 --> 01:29:35.625
For now, there are seven victims
from the convicts.

01:29:45.833 --> 01:29:47.125
Did you have enough time?

01:29:48.375 --> 01:29:50.083
Did you manage to call them?

01:29:55.583 --> 01:29:57.625
You're no hero, Yan!

01:29:58.750 --> 01:29:59.833
I could tell immediately.

01:29:59.875 --> 01:30:02.041
You have no resemblance to them.

01:30:02.833 --> 01:30:04.166
But you'll have an honorable death.

01:30:04.208 --> 01:30:05.958
Out of respect
for your scientific endeavors.

01:30:22.875 --> 01:30:23.708
The syringe!

01:30:24.916 --> 01:30:25.750
No.

01:30:26.541 --> 01:30:27.833
-Not yet.
-The syringe.

01:30:39.250 --> 01:30:40.083
Come on!

01:30:41.625 --> 01:30:42.458
Faster!

01:31:48.875 --> 01:31:50.000
Run!

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.458
Fire!

01:32:31.541 --> 01:32:34.916
If you find the fugitives, take
all possible measures to detain them.

01:32:40.666 --> 01:32:42.166
-Pull over!
-Get out of here!

01:32:52.458 --> 01:32:53.375
As you were!

01:34:38.333 --> 01:34:39.333
Kostya!

01:34:42.250 --> 01:34:43.083
Sorry!

01:34:43.958 --> 01:34:44.750
What are you doing?

01:34:45.833 --> 01:34:47.333
Your condition worsened!

01:34:47.625 --> 01:34:48.750
You won't survive without it.

01:34:49.333 --> 01:34:50.583
We can still leave...

01:34:51.333 --> 01:34:52.125
We can do it!

01:36:14.708 --> 01:36:17.083
Have you changed your mind,
Tatiana Yurievna?

01:36:18.833 --> 01:36:20.000
I was mistaken.

01:36:24.708 --> 01:36:25.875
They can't be separated.

01:36:32.083 --> 01:36:33.625
They have become fully symbiotic.

01:36:35.083 --> 01:36:36.458
They'll die without each other.

01:36:37.333 --> 01:36:39.500
Well, no matter.

01:36:40.333 --> 01:36:41.583
Everyone makes mistakes.

01:36:48.875 --> 01:36:51.458
We won't let them die, right?

01:36:59.583 --> 01:37:01.875
Do you know what your problem is?

01:37:02.708 --> 01:37:05.708
You try to save everyone!

01:37:07.083 --> 01:37:07.958
But that's impossible.

01:37:10.333 --> 01:37:12.958
You must always choose.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:09.875
He's gone.

01:39:14.708 --> 01:39:16.083
We can separate you.

01:39:18.458 --> 01:39:19.458
We'll try in Moscow.

01:39:22.625 --> 01:39:23.708
It'll be OK.

01:39:24.333 --> 01:39:25.250
I know.

01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:27.958
We'll think of something.

01:39:44.875 --> 01:39:45.833
I already have.

01:40:54.750 --> 01:41:01.458
ROSTOV-ON-DON

01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.833
Why do you keep coming back
here like a bee to the flower?

01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:35.958
Why won't you lie calmly?
Why this running?

01:41:37.833 --> 01:41:39.208
Why on earth do you need those?

01:41:39.750 --> 01:41:40.875
Where are you going like that?

01:41:43.333 --> 01:41:45.000
Do you have parents?

01:42:01.708 --> 01:42:02.625
Go on!

01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:05.583
But just play around the complex, OK?

01:42:05.625 --> 01:42:07.208
Or they'll take away my award.

01:42:33.208 --> 01:42:34.833
Hello! Tatiana Klimova.

01:42:35.333 --> 01:42:37.083
I'm here to adopt Lyosha Romanov.

01:43:09.625 --> 01:43:10.833
No problem!

01:43:11.458 --> 01:43:12.708
God loves everyone.

01:43:13.833 --> 01:43:15.958
I've done this sedentary job twenty years.

01:43:16.708 --> 01:43:17.958
And it's fine.

01:43:19.583 --> 01:43:21.500
You're going to be alright, little fellow.

01:43:23.958 --> 01:43:25.083
I'm not a boy.

01:43:25.833 --> 01:43:27.208
My name is Tanya.

01:43:58.500 --> 01:43:59.583
So you're Lyosha?

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:04.583
My name is Tanya.

01:44:07.875 --> 01:44:09.083
