WEBVTT

01:09.125 --> 01:12.000
Turning yourself over was a wise decision.

01:13.083 --> 01:14.291
Come with me.

01:45.416 --> 01:47.000
Begin testing her at once.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.500
I want confirmation.

01:51.916 --> 01:53.583
Is there a problem, Dr. Karr?

01:54.333 --> 01:55.541
No.

01:55.541 --> 01:56.833
I'll handle it.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.541
Where's Nala Se?

02:01.416 --> 02:02.916
In a cell.

02:02.916 --> 02:06.625
I'm afraid the Kaminoan
won't be aiding you in another escape.

02:08.041 --> 02:09.833
I'll return later for the results.

02:18.500 --> 02:19.541
Emerie,

02:20.416 --> 02:22.416
you don't have to do this.

02:26.083 --> 02:28.250
I'm sorry, but I do.

02:33.333 --> 02:34.625
For what it's worth,

02:36.541 --> 02:37.958
I'm glad you're safe.

02:39.500 --> 02:40.708
Am I?

03:15.916 --> 03:20.416
The troopers have pulled out,
but the cruiser's still jamming our comms.

03:20.416 --> 03:23.333
I still can't believe you let
Omega turn herself in.

03:23.833 --> 03:26.791
The Empire would have destroyed
this whole town.

03:26.791 --> 03:28.416
She stopped them.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.875
Yeah, and they've got her again.

03:32.958 --> 03:35.166
And we're stuck here without a ship.

03:35.166 --> 03:37.375
Even if we get our hands on a ship,

03:37.375 --> 03:39.875
we still have no way
of finding Tantiss base.

03:41.083 --> 03:43.750
That's not exactly true.

03:44.833 --> 03:48.750
Wait. You've known
where Tantiss is this whole time?

03:48.750 --> 03:50.625
I didn't say I know.

03:51.291 --> 03:54.625
There's someone
who might have the coordinates.

03:54.625 --> 03:55.708
Who?

03:56.583 --> 03:58.208
Admiral Rampart.

03:58.916 --> 04:03.208
He sent Nala Se there
when we decommissioned Tipoca City.

04:03.708 --> 04:05.416
Why didn't you say anything before?

04:06.041 --> 04:11.458
Because Tantiss isn't a place
I ever wanted to go back to.

04:12.375 --> 04:16.541
And Rampart's
not particularly trustworthy.

04:17.583 --> 04:22.958
He is a last resort,
but he's also our only option.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.458
Where's Rampart now?

04:25.416 --> 04:27.833
I was still in the Empire
when they arrested him.

04:28.416 --> 04:29.500
He was sent to--

04:37.875 --> 04:38.875
Do not shoot!

04:39.375 --> 04:41.041
I second that.

04:42.375 --> 04:44.125
I found Phee during my scout.

04:44.625 --> 04:47.208
I saw the Imperials on my approach.

04:47.208 --> 04:50.250
When I landed, Doc here
briefed me on the situation.

04:50.250 --> 04:52.708
How did you get in here unseen?

04:52.708 --> 04:55.833
Used the hidden cavern access
when I docked my ship.

04:55.833 --> 04:58.166
We're gonna need to borrow that.

04:58.875 --> 05:01.083
You must be Crosshair.

05:01.083 --> 05:04.833
Tech told me all about
your sparkling personality.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.833
Is that a no?

05:07.416 --> 05:10.666
Any friend of brown eyes
is a friend of mine.

05:10.666 --> 05:11.958
Where are we heading?

05:13.541 --> 05:16.375
An Imperial labor camp on Erebus.

05:16.375 --> 05:19.375
Ooh, I like this already.

06:06.041 --> 06:08.208
Don't you order me around.

06:08.208 --> 06:10.041
You're the one slowing us down.

06:17.166 --> 06:20.583
I called in a favor
with one of my contacts.

06:21.083 --> 06:22.916
It cost me a hefty sum,

06:22.916 --> 06:27.166
but I've got an overview
of the labor camp on Erebus.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.916
Think you can get us close enough
to the perimeter undetected?

06:29.916 --> 06:31.875
I know I can.

06:31.875 --> 06:33.333
Tricks of the trade.

06:33.333 --> 06:38.208
But once you're past the perimeter,
they've got guards, sensors, and scouts.

06:38.208 --> 06:41.291
Give us a real challenge.

06:41.291 --> 06:42.791
Once we hit the ground,

06:42.791 --> 06:46.291
we have to tap into the prison data bank
and pinpoint Rampart's location.

06:46.291 --> 06:49.083
We can use a terminal
at one of the checkpoints.

06:51.041 --> 06:54.916
Phee, when we acquire the target,
we'll comm you for a pickup.

07:05.791 --> 07:10.833
Uh, if we get any closer to those ships,
we'll show up on their sensors.

07:10.833 --> 07:12.208
No, we won't.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.125
Remember that trick I mentioned?

07:15.875 --> 07:16.875
Phee.

07:16.875 --> 07:18.333
Oh, relax.

07:18.333 --> 07:21.208
I'd expect you to know
a stealth approach when you see it.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.041
Quiet as usual.

08:22.041 --> 08:25.291
Hopefully, next assignment
we'll see some action.

08:29.458 --> 08:31.791
Plug in
and find out where Rampart is.

08:47.041 --> 08:49.041
Why haven't we heard the signal?

08:49.041 --> 08:51.041
Our shift was supposed to be over by now.

08:53.333 --> 08:58.291
I've told you I don't speak...
...whatever it is you speak.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.625
At least we're
in agreement on that.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.250
Found him.

09:17.250 --> 09:21.250
Rampart's tagged to be transported back
to the prison from the mining structure.

09:21.750 --> 09:24.500
The prison's on the other side
of this bridge.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.166
Our best shot at grabbing Rampart

09:26.166 --> 09:28.875
is to intercept them
when they're en route from the mine.

09:28.875 --> 09:31.041
Take on a turbo tank?

09:31.041 --> 09:33.583
Yeah. Now you're talking.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.291
We can't hit it head-on.

09:35.291 --> 09:37.000
They'll see us coming.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.250
Not if we're under it.

09:45.833 --> 09:47.041
Follow me.

09:56.458 --> 09:57.666
This is Transport One.

09:57.666 --> 09:58.875
Prisoners are secure.

09:58.875 --> 10:00.333
Heading back to base now.

10:06.125 --> 10:07.625
Get into position.

10:07.625 --> 10:09.125
I'll secure the controls.

10:09.125 --> 10:10.875
You two handle Rampart.

10:22.208 --> 10:23.208
Now.

10:32.875 --> 10:35.166
- A sensor's been tripped.

10:35.166 --> 10:36.250
Check it out.

10:47.708 --> 10:48.791
Anything?

10:48.791 --> 10:49.916
Yep.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.666
Clear.

10:59.708 --> 11:01.583
It's magnetically sealed.

11:01.583 --> 11:03.958
Wrecker, remember plan 55?

11:05.583 --> 11:07.625
Oh. Yeah. 55.

11:07.625 --> 11:08.833
Waiting on you.

11:08.833 --> 11:09.916
Go.

11:25.875 --> 11:29.166
CT-9904?

11:29.166 --> 11:30.708
You remembered.

11:30.708 --> 11:32.250
How touching.

11:32.791 --> 11:33.833
The target's secured.

11:33.833 --> 11:35.541
The target?

11:35.541 --> 11:36.958
What is this?

11:36.958 --> 11:38.291
Are you here to kill me?

11:38.291 --> 11:41.000
Tempting, but no.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.791
What about them?

11:49.125 --> 11:50.125
Move it!

11:50.125 --> 11:51.750
Go! Now!

11:52.541 --> 11:53.750
Come on. Move it!

11:56.750 --> 12:00.083
Sir, one of the transports has made
an unscheduled stop mid-route.

12:00.083 --> 12:02.458
Run a diagnostic on their comms.

12:03.291 --> 12:04.583
<i>All clear.</i>

12:08.666 --> 12:11.000
That should distract
the Imperials for a bit.

12:11.791 --> 12:13.500
And what about me?

12:13.500 --> 12:16.291
You're fine right where you are.

12:17.583 --> 12:21.375
If you're not here to execute me,
and you're not letting me go,

12:22.625 --> 12:25.291
then you must need something from me.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.708
Tantiss base.

12:27.708 --> 12:29.375
Where is it?

12:29.375 --> 12:31.041
Ah.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.875
Tantiss.

12:34.083 --> 12:37.041
And how much is
that information worth to you?

12:37.041 --> 12:40.875
You're not in a position to bargain.

12:40.875 --> 12:42.041
Hmm.

12:43.041 --> 12:44.291
I disagree.

12:45.375 --> 12:50.583
I'll talk after you get me
off this planet.

12:51.125 --> 12:56.000
You don't get what you want
if I don't get what I want.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.833
<i>We're approaching the bridge.</i>

12:57.833 --> 12:59.375
<i>Wrecker, man the cannon.</i>

13:04.125 --> 13:07.708
Sir, I believe Transport One's comms
are being jammed.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.375
What?

13:17.708 --> 13:19.750
The tank's speed is increasing.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.916
I think it's been compromised.

13:23.125 --> 13:25.000
Bring up the gunships,
seal off the bridge,

13:25.000 --> 13:27.750
and reroute Transport Two to intercept.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.666
- New orders.

13:34.666 --> 13:35.875
We're to hold the bridge.

13:44.708 --> 13:47.041
Hunter, they're sealing off the bridge!

13:47.041 --> 13:48.333
I see it.

13:55.583 --> 13:57.041
Is that all they've got?

14:14.416 --> 14:15.583
The armor's too strong.

14:15.583 --> 14:17.000
Take out the wheels.

14:25.125 --> 14:26.291
Hold on!

14:37.583 --> 14:38.875
Oh, please.

14:38.875 --> 14:40.416
You're not going to kill me.

14:40.416 --> 14:41.875
Hmm.

14:41.875 --> 14:42.958
Not yet.

15:12.583 --> 15:14.916
Phee, we're past the perimeter
and need that pickup.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.708
Cannons are offline!

15:45.458 --> 15:46.916
We've got troopers up top.

16:01.291 --> 16:02.625
Controls are dead.

16:03.208 --> 16:05.125
We're running out of road!

16:10.958 --> 16:13.500
Not exactly a stealth exit, boys.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.000
Let's move!

16:30.708 --> 16:32.708
Move closer!

16:32.708 --> 16:34.125
Hurry! Jump!

16:38.625 --> 16:39.875
Whoa.

17:06.375 --> 17:07.791
We got you off the planet.

17:07.791 --> 17:09.500
Now tell us where Tantiss is.

17:10.750 --> 17:13.416
It's more complicated than that.

17:13.416 --> 17:15.208
Complicated how?

17:16.250 --> 17:18.541
No one knows the coordinates to Tantiss.

17:19.250 --> 17:20.875
It was designed that way.

17:22.375 --> 17:26.833
But I might know how to get around that.

17:26.833 --> 17:32.500
Either you tell us now, or we drop you
back in that Imperial prison.

17:32.500 --> 17:33.583
Now, now.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.375
No need for threats.

17:35.375 --> 17:38.541
After all, we're in this together.

18:16.333 --> 18:20.125
Dr. Karr, what are Omega's results?

18:20.125 --> 18:23.875
Her blood sample yielded
a favorable M-Count replication.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.041
As expected.

18:26.041 --> 18:27.458
What does that mean?

18:28.083 --> 18:29.250
I'll show you.

18:48.458 --> 18:54.125
Did you know an individual's M-Count
can not be directly replicated?

18:54.125 --> 18:59.000
Attempts have been made,
but each time, the levels degraded.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.583
And so we experimented.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.833
Where are you taking me?

19:09.791 --> 19:11.000
The vault.

19:15.208 --> 19:17.750
We tried various methods,

19:18.375 --> 19:20.833
mixing samples
from our other test subjects,

19:20.833 --> 19:22.583
yet nothing worked...

19:24.750 --> 19:30.041
until we combined your sample
with one of our M-Count specimens.

19:39.666 --> 19:43.583
You are a vital piece
to our work here, Omega.

19:55.791 --> 19:57.708
Who are they?

19:58.208 --> 20:01.125
They are the rest of the puzzle.

20:01.125 --> 20:03.541
And this, this is your new home.
