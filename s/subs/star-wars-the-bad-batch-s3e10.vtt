[engines roaring]

00:47.875 --> 00:51.000
[cooing, giggling]

00:55.125 --> 00:57.208
[coos, babbles]

01:01.541 --> 01:04.375
[giggles, exclaims]

01:05.333 --> 01:07.750
[grunts, groans]

01:07.833 --> 01:08.958
[vendor] Twenty credits.

01:09.541 --> 01:10.625
[scoffs] Ten.

01:10.708 --> 01:12.041
- [toddler crying]
- Twenty.

01:12.125 --> 01:13.166
Fifteen.

01:15.083 --> 01:17.625
- [crying continues]
- Hey! Who threw that?

01:17.708 --> 01:19.000
It was him.

01:19.083 --> 01:23.916
The kid can barely lift a vase that big,
let alone throw one.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.458
- [crying continues]
- But he did. [stammers] We saw it.

01:26.541 --> 01:28.458
Sorry. So sorry.

01:29.083 --> 01:31.875
[toddler whines]

01:31.958 --> 01:34.125
I told you that kid was strange.

01:34.708 --> 01:38.083
People say he's cursed. You know? Gifted.

01:38.166 --> 01:41.375
Shh. Don't go saying things like that.

01:41.458 --> 01:44.875
You know what kind of trouble
that could bring. Come on.

02:08.250 --> 02:09.500
[terminal beeping]

02:11.041 --> 02:16.458
I've got a tip
for a class one bounty hunter.

02:17.500 --> 02:22.166
There's a kid here
you might be interested in.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.625
[terminal beeping]

02:31.000 --> 02:33.083
[insects buzzing]

02:56.125 --> 02:57.291
[door closes]

02:58.791 --> 02:59.791
What's the issue?

03:00.500 --> 03:04.166
Progress in the lab has stalled
since Nala Se's confinement.

03:04.250 --> 03:06.541
The Kaminoan can no longer be trusted.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.125
Do you trust me?

03:09.458 --> 03:11.458
I've spent years working by your side.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.125
With a proper clearance,

03:15.125 --> 03:16.750
I could be more useful.

03:16.833 --> 03:20.333
You wish to be the new chief scientist,
Dr. Karr?

03:21.416 --> 03:22.791
I believe I have earned it.

03:23.666 --> 03:25.458
Hmm. Very well.

03:26.666 --> 03:30.250
Let's begin by bringing you
up to speed on Project Necromancer.

03:43.541 --> 03:48.375
In addition to the assets
in the sublevel containment chamber,

03:48.916 --> 03:52.041
- you will be given access to the vault.
- [control panel beeps]

04:08.041 --> 04:11.916
The specimens within
are now your responsibility.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.041
- They are vital to this project.
- [control panel beeps]

04:17.125 --> 04:20.166
And thus,
must be handled with the utmost care.

04:24.041 --> 04:25.041
[datapad beeps]

04:26.000 --> 04:28.041
[devices beeping]

04:38.291 --> 04:42.041
These particular three were selected
because of their high M-count.

04:43.375 --> 04:44.958
Why children?

04:46.291 --> 04:48.875
Are there not adults
that could serve this purpose?

04:49.625 --> 04:52.833
There are few adults left
with such characteristics.

04:57.583 --> 05:02.291
Children are easier to attain
and more agreeable to the subjugations.

05:02.375 --> 05:07.208
They're unaware of why they're here
and what they possess.

05:08.250 --> 05:12.208
As you know, M-count cannot be
directly replicated from the source.

05:12.291 --> 05:14.375
However, Nala Se knew of another way.

05:15.041 --> 05:17.250
Which is why she aided in Omega's escape.

05:17.791 --> 05:20.958
The young clone's blood is the only binder
that's proven to be compatible

05:21.041 --> 05:23.541
with their DNA to re-create
their M-count levels.

05:24.166 --> 05:26.500
And why Omega must be found.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.875
Testing should proceed as planned.

05:30.958 --> 05:34.750
We must be prepared for every possibility
once she is recovered.

05:34.833 --> 05:36.166
Sir.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.208
[specimen] Hello.

05:43.291 --> 05:44.291
[Emerie] Hello.

05:44.791 --> 05:46.333
I like your glasses.

05:46.416 --> 05:48.625
Uh, thank you.

05:50.166 --> 05:51.625
What is your name?

05:52.416 --> 05:53.416
Dr. Karr?

05:55.125 --> 05:58.250
Limit your personal interactions
with the specimens.

06:00.583 --> 06:04.000
They are scientific assets, nothing more.

06:04.708 --> 06:06.375
Of course, Doctor.

06:35.833 --> 06:37.333
[laughing]

06:37.416 --> 06:38.833
Oh. [chuckles]

06:38.916 --> 06:40.791
- [cooing]
- Uh, uh, uh.

06:42.291 --> 06:44.708
- [grunting]
- [cooing]

06:44.791 --> 06:46.958
[footsteps approaching]

06:47.041 --> 06:48.708
[cooing continues]

06:52.208 --> 06:55.125
[cooing]

07:01.333 --> 07:02.458
[giggling]

07:06.791 --> 07:08.083
[coos]

07:08.166 --> 07:10.333
[footsteps approaching]

07:12.208 --> 07:13.875
[gasps, exhales sharply]

07:15.458 --> 07:17.166
[gasps, grunts]

07:19.000 --> 07:20.291
[cries]

07:25.208 --> 07:28.083
Todo, the test.

07:28.791 --> 07:30.166
Coming right up, Mr. Bane.

07:31.083 --> 07:33.500
[whining]

07:42.041 --> 07:44.875
[beeping]

07:46.666 --> 07:47.666
That'll do.

07:49.416 --> 07:51.958
- [control panel beeps]
- [capsule whirring]

07:55.291 --> 07:57.625
[hisses]

07:58.250 --> 08:00.041
[whimpers]

08:02.333 --> 08:05.958
- [wailing]
- Keep that thing quiet.

08:06.041 --> 08:07.750
I am not a nanny droid.

08:09.208 --> 08:12.166
- [wailing continues]
- You! You, there. Stop that.

08:13.250 --> 08:14.250
[grunts]

08:16.083 --> 08:17.708
- [Todo groans]
- [coos]

08:17.791 --> 08:21.250
Oh. Oh! [chuckles] I did it.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.500
Let's move.

08:24.541 --> 08:27.458
[controls beeping]

08:31.916 --> 08:33.208
[whimpers]

08:38.166 --> 08:39.833
Thanks for the tip.

08:39.916 --> 08:41.416
[coins jingling]

08:43.750 --> 08:47.333
[grumbling]

08:59.958 --> 09:01.375
[datapad beeping]

09:01.458 --> 09:02.625
[specimen] Hello again.

09:03.791 --> 09:05.708
Hello, SP-54.

09:06.458 --> 09:08.875
My name's Eva. What's yours?

09:09.666 --> 09:13.500
You may refer to me as Dr. Karr.

09:14.458 --> 09:18.500
What happened to Mistress Nala Se?
She hasn't been back.

09:18.583 --> 09:23.083
She is no longer overseeing this project.

09:23.916 --> 09:25.208
Why not?

09:25.291 --> 09:26.916
That is not your concern.

09:27.000 --> 09:31.750
Oh, but she said she'd find out for me.

09:32.458 --> 09:33.625
Find out what?

09:34.416 --> 09:35.750
When I'll be going home.

09:36.916 --> 09:38.375
Can you find out for me?

09:40.750 --> 09:41.750
I will look into it.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.083
Thank you, Dr. Karr.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.708
[datapad beeping]

09:53.833 --> 09:55.708
Hello, SP-32.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.666
[drill whirring]

10:10.791 --> 10:12.666
- [beeps]
- [doors close]

10:12.750 --> 10:16.000
[alarm blaring]

10:16.083 --> 10:17.916
- [beeps, buzzes]
- No!

10:21.333 --> 10:22.666
[Emerie] SP-32.

10:24.083 --> 10:26.375
- Stay away from me.
- It's all right.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.916
No! Let me out of here.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.625
You're safe, SP-32.

10:31.708 --> 10:32.916
That's not my name.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.333
[alarm continues]

10:35.416 --> 10:38.583
They said I could go home.
I just wanna go home.

10:42.833 --> 10:43.833
Set to stun.

10:47.916 --> 10:49.291
What's the situation?

10:49.375 --> 10:51.125
Blasters are not necessary.

10:51.208 --> 10:54.083
I have everything under control.

10:58.708 --> 10:59.875
Don't!

11:05.291 --> 11:06.833
Secure him in his room.

11:11.375 --> 11:15.458
Your actions were extreme, Commander.
He's only a child.

11:15.541 --> 11:20.541
The specimen attempted to escape.
I was following protocol.

11:35.458 --> 11:37.375
[droid chirps]

11:41.166 --> 11:42.541
[chirps]

11:54.083 --> 11:55.083
[Eva] Dr. Karr?

11:55.750 --> 11:56.833
Yes?

11:56.916 --> 12:00.375
Is Jax going to be okay?

12:00.458 --> 12:01.666
Jax?

12:04.208 --> 12:05.208
He'll be fine.

12:06.083 --> 12:09.958
He's not going to be in trouble, is he?

12:10.750 --> 12:15.000
No, he's not in trouble.
You can see him tomorrow.

12:40.458 --> 12:41.625
[control panel beeps]

12:44.208 --> 12:45.416
Mistress Se,

12:46.250 --> 12:49.500
I have questions regarding your work
on Project Necromancer.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.750
You have taken my place then.

12:54.291 --> 12:55.333
I have.

12:55.416 --> 12:59.333
Which means you've been to the vault

13:00.041 --> 13:03.875
and seen the specimens.

13:04.666 --> 13:05.708
They're children.

13:06.791 --> 13:07.833
Like I was.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.666
Was your plan to discard them too?

13:11.750 --> 13:16.500
The Empire will keep them
in order to control them.

13:17.625 --> 13:19.000
They don't belong here.

13:20.208 --> 13:22.916
No, they do not.

13:23.791 --> 13:26.500
But none of this was my choice.

13:27.458 --> 13:30.208
I had to protect Omega.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.500
And what about the other children?

13:33.125 --> 13:35.416
I did what I could.

13:36.375 --> 13:39.083
Now they will look to you.

13:40.166 --> 13:43.666
What will you do, Emerie?

13:43.750 --> 13:45.166
There is nothing I can do.

13:46.083 --> 13:47.875
I don't have that kind of power.

13:49.375 --> 13:50.666
[Nala Se] Don't you?

13:59.416 --> 14:00.416
[door closes]

14:09.250 --> 14:12.333
Dr. Karr, a word?

14:14.083 --> 14:17.041
A new specimen will be arriving today.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.750
Commander Scorch is departing shortly
to retrieve it.

14:20.291 --> 14:21.291
Another?

14:21.375 --> 14:25.750
I heard about the earlier incident,
so I understand your hesitation.

14:25.833 --> 14:30.500
[inhales deeply] However, this latest
acquisition will not be a danger to you.

14:30.583 --> 14:32.500
I would like to accompany the commander.

14:32.583 --> 14:34.291
That is not necessary.

14:34.375 --> 14:37.875
You've stated how important
these specimens are, Doctor.

14:38.625 --> 14:42.083
I would like to ensure that they are
properly maintained at every stage.

14:42.666 --> 14:46.541
Sir, Governor Tarkin requests
you contact him at once.

14:47.458 --> 14:49.500
Do as you wish, Dr. Karr.

14:59.250 --> 15:00.375
[device beeps]

15:02.166 --> 15:03.916
[beeping]

15:04.750 --> 15:09.458
Governor Tarkin,
to what do I owe this, uh, summons?

15:09.541 --> 15:12.875
<i>Questions have been raised
regarding the financial impact</i>

15:12.958 --> 15:16.333
<i>your facility is having
upon Imperial resources.</i>

15:16.416 --> 15:20.500
<i>And now additional funds
have been diverted at your request?</i>

15:20.583 --> 15:25.708
That is correct. It is for a project that
is of personal interest to the Emperor.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.541
<i>Which is what?</i>

15:27.625 --> 15:29.166
Oh, I'm afraid that's classified.

15:29.916 --> 15:32.291
<i>Perhaps there is
some assistance I may provide,</i>

15:32.375 --> 15:34.666
<i>seeing this is of such importance?</i>

15:34.750 --> 15:37.875
Mmm, the funding is all I require.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.708
It is worth the expenditure.

15:41.791 --> 15:43.250
<i>You had better hope so.</i>

15:43.333 --> 15:46.125
<i>If this project fails
to yield proper results,</i>

15:46.208 --> 15:48.750
<i>it won't bode well for your operation.</i>

15:48.833 --> 15:51.000
<i>Or for you, Doctor.</i>

15:54.750 --> 15:55.916
[beeping]

16:01.666 --> 16:02.666
[beeps]

16:05.583 --> 16:07.208
I require an update.

16:07.291 --> 16:12.458
<i>I tracked down the Trandoshan
and pulled some intel out of her.</i>

16:12.541 --> 16:17.250
<i>She gave up the name of a pirate
that's been in contact with the target.</i>

16:17.333 --> 16:19.250
<i>I'm searching for her now.</i>

16:19.333 --> 16:22.291
The other operatives aren't ready
to join you in the field.

16:22.375 --> 16:24.958
<i>I can handle it on my own.</i>

16:25.458 --> 16:29.208
[sighs] Can you really?
'Cause you've already failed once.

16:30.083 --> 16:33.125
No more mistakes.
Do not return without Omega.

17:22.208 --> 17:25.208
You're not the usual Imperial they send.

17:25.291 --> 17:29.458
I'm here to inspect the specimen.
Who I am is none of your concern.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.958
Todo, bring out the kid.

17:45.666 --> 17:46.666
[groans]

17:49.375 --> 17:50.666
Problem?

17:51.291 --> 17:55.458
This specimen is younger than I expected.

17:56.166 --> 17:57.750
Then he'll be less trouble.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.500
I need to test him.

17:59.583 --> 18:01.250
[coos]

18:01.333 --> 18:02.625
For confirmation.

18:05.166 --> 18:07.208
My payment?

18:14.458 --> 18:16.708
How many others like this
have you captured?

18:16.791 --> 18:20.958
Let's just say I'm good at my job.

18:26.791 --> 18:28.833
[beeping]

18:29.416 --> 18:31.000
[whimpers]

18:32.000 --> 18:33.958
And where did this child come from?

18:34.500 --> 18:39.708
Asking questions like that,
you give away more than you think.

18:41.583 --> 18:43.166
[Todo] It's all here, Mr. Bane.

18:43.875 --> 18:45.791
Until next time.

Where is SP-32?

19:40.458 --> 19:42.333
It is standard operating procedure

19:42.416 --> 19:46.333
for a subject to be isolated
for two rotations

19:46.416 --> 19:49.250
as punishment following an escape attempt.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.250
Eva?
