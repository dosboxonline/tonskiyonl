WEBVTT

01:40.901 --> 01:43.671
She's back! She's home!

01:43.771 --> 01:45.205
Philippa came home!

02:26.614 --> 02:30.082
<i>
Two years,</i>

02:30.083 --> 02:34.154
<i>and everything looks
exactly as I remember.</i>

02:35.623 --> 02:39.159
<i>I never thought
I would see this place again.</i>

02:41.995 --> 02:45.533
There were 18 of us this time.

02:45.666 --> 02:49.370
Culled from every corner
of the Empire

02:49.470 --> 02:52.139
and brought to Terra
for the contest.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.608
We were told that
only one of us would survive

02:55.609 --> 02:57.878
the years to come.

02:58.011 --> 03:01.114
One child...

03:02.850 --> 03:06.887
...the purest expression
of the Terran identity.

03:07.655 --> 03:11.024
They pitted us
against each other.

03:11.124 --> 03:15.229
And month by month,
our numbers dwindled.

03:17.064 --> 03:20.368
Did... did you win?

03:21.235 --> 03:22.736
Is it over?

03:22.870 --> 03:25.939
Two of us still live.

03:31.945 --> 03:34.582
San and me.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.886
<i>Me and San.</i>

03:41.455 --> 03:43.891
BOTH
We are two...

03:44.758 --> 03:46.460
...but one.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.496
Forever.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.200
The word "friend" was forbidden
during the contest,

03:53.301 --> 03:56.604
but we whispered it to each
other when no one could hear.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.839
San and I combined our skills

03:59.840 --> 04:03.444
against the proctor
and the other contestants.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.113
But only one of you
could be emperor.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.518
One task remains.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.922
The first to complete it
rules the Empire,

04:15.022 --> 04:16.757
and the other spends
the rest of their life

04:16.857 --> 04:18.891
in servitude to the new emperor.

04:18.892 --> 04:21.194
What do you have to do?

04:37.845 --> 04:39.078
I'm sorry.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.048
What did you do?!

04:42.115 --> 04:46.052
"No ties to the old life
are permitted.

04:47.421 --> 04:50.658
"An emperor can only be
loyal to duty.

04:50.791 --> 04:54.894
"Thus does the Empire
remain strong.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.365
Thus does it grow."

05:01.134 --> 05:03.537
- Mom.
- Philippa.

06:31.191 --> 06:35.763
You succeeded where
your competitor could not.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.833
Bring him here.

06:41.835 --> 06:45.872
San did not have the strength
to pass the final test.

06:45.873 --> 06:51.479
Even now, his village burns
as a testament to his cowardice.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.584
I love you.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.554
You have won the contest.

07:00.654 --> 07:04.056
Claim your victory.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.242
San, step forward.

07:22.342 --> 07:26.814
You live now only to serve
at her heel.

07:38.992 --> 07:42.362
Kneel before the one
who owns your life.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.578
We are two...

07:58.779 --> 08:00.147
But one.

08:01.715 --> 08:03.584
Not anymore.

08:30.477 --> 08:33.981
All hail Philippa Georgiou!

08:34.081 --> 08:35.783
All hail the emperor!

08:37.017 --> 08:40.353
CROWD
Hail! Hail! Hail!

08:40.453 --> 08:42.623
<i>Hail!</i>

08:56.103 --> 08:57.571
<i>
This is Control</i>

08:57.671 --> 09:00.540
<i>with a priority message
for Alpha Team Leader.</i>

09:01.775 --> 09:04.945
<i>Your subject is
Emperor Philippa Georgiou,</i>

09:05.045 --> 09:07.615
<i>former ruler
of the Terran Empire.</i>

09:07.715 --> 09:09.381
<i>It's in a parallel universe</i>

09:09.382 --> 09:11.785
<i>with the most criminal
population</i>

09:11.885 --> 09:13.153
<i>in recorded history.</i>

09:14.154 --> 09:17.658
<i>Even there, Georgiou had the
market cornered on atrocities.</i>

09:19.092 --> 09:23.296
<i>In 2257, she was brought
to our universe</i>

09:23.430 --> 09:25.097
<i>and joined Section 31,</i>

09:25.098 --> 09:29.002
<i>but after a few years,
we lost contact.</i>

09:30.370 --> 09:32.973
<i>Recently, Georgiou was spotted
using an alias</i>

09:33.106 --> 09:36.442
<i>in the border territory
outside Federation space,</i>

09:36.443 --> 09:40.513
<i>where we're tracking a new
threat on the black market.</i>

09:40.648 --> 09:42.783
<i>This is where
your team comes in.</i>

09:42.883 --> 09:46.754
<i>Federation treaty forbids us
from crossing over that border,</i>

09:46.854 --> 09:50.290
<i>which means Starfleet cannot
get its hands dirty.</i>

09:50.390 --> 09:53.827
<i>You and your 31 team will go in,
make contact with Georgiou</i>

09:53.961 --> 09:58.165
<i>to help identify
and neutralize the threat.</i>

09:58.265 --> 10:00.968
<i>But make no mistake...</i>

10:01.068 --> 10:04.972
<i>this dog bites,
so watch your backs.</i>

10:05.806 --> 10:08.475
<i>You have 24 hours
to complete the mission.</i>

10:08.575 --> 10:10.510
<i>Get to work.</i>

11:48.608 --> 11:50.811
Madame du Franc?

11:50.911 --> 11:53.180
Small incident in
the honeymoon suite.

11:53.280 --> 11:54.748
I'm afraid the bride molted

11:54.848 --> 11:57.617
just as things were
coming to a climax.

11:57.751 --> 12:00.287
Virgil,
get to the point.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.924
I sent a biohazard team
and your condolences.

12:04.024 --> 12:08.829
Also, there's a customer
hoping for a word with you.

12:09.629 --> 12:13.500
He seems entirely sober
but quite intoxicating.

12:19.672 --> 12:22.575
Madame Veronique du Franc
will see you.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.821
Alok Sahar,
Madame Veronique du Franc.

12:33.954 --> 12:37.057
Madame du Franc normally
does business by appointment.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.658
I'd like to make an appointment.

12:38.758 --> 12:41.228
Oh, the gentleman would like
to make an appointment.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.496
-Now.
-Now, madame.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.899
-  <i>Impossible.</i>
-  Impossible.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.339
Mmm.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.277
Mmm.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.547
<i>Au revoir, Virgil.</i>

13:00.647 --> 13:03.016
Mm-hmm.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.032
That is illegal.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.601
And that makes money.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.871
This is a reputable
establishment.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.405
Not what I heard.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.806
- Why don't we discuss it
in your office?
- Hmm.

13:27.807 --> 13:31.945
Why would I take you
to my office, Alok Sahar?

13:32.045 --> 13:35.916
Because it's
a hands-on experience.

13:46.994 --> 13:48.694
<i>♪ Everywhere I go ♪</i>

13:48.695 --> 13:50.362
<i>♪ Everybody knows... ♪</i>

13:52.665 --> 13:54.734
Dulcet thistle.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.637
Dulcet thistle's extinct.

13:57.737 --> 13:59.406
I've got a dozen keys
of this stuff.

13:59.506 --> 14:02.075
Have you partaken?

14:02.175 --> 14:07.280
This would be
one of my few first times.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.381
Packs a punch.

14:09.382 --> 14:12.285
- A happy punch.
- Mmm.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.629
Bottoms up.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.397
- To money.
- To you.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.404
Mmm.

14:38.445 --> 14:41.614
Now, let's cut the shit.

14:41.748 --> 14:45.618
What is Section 31 doing
in my space station?

14:45.718 --> 14:49.056
Hmm? You think I don't know
an agent when I see one?

14:49.156 --> 14:50.991
You're heading up a team
of six operatives,

14:51.124 --> 14:53.460
and they're all over the bar.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.497
<i>There's the Chameloid,</i>

14:57.630 --> 15:00.200
<i>a green-blooded shape-shifter,</i>

15:00.300 --> 15:04.171
<i>trying to muster sexy time
with a Deltan,</i>

15:04.271 --> 15:05.904
<i>a walking honey trap</i>

15:05.905 --> 15:09.142
<i>31's obviously using
as a distraction.</i>

15:09.242 --> 15:13.112
Except Chameloids are
the only species in the galaxy

15:13.113 --> 15:16.749
immune to
Deltan sexy time charm.

15:16.849 --> 15:20.320
Then there's the guy
with all the high-end mech,

15:20.453 --> 15:24.456
standing in the back,
looking like he has thoughts.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.459
Mech life, it ain't
just about the brute force.

15:29.429 --> 15:33.166
<i>
I'm gonna say heavy
on artillery, low on IQ.</i>

15:33.266 --> 15:35.202
I'm so sorry.

15:35.335 --> 15:36.669
And we can't forget the Vulcan,

15:36.769 --> 15:40.340
laughing way too hard
at the stage banter.

15:43.143 --> 15:47.247
<i>And since Vulcans never laugh,
he's either an idiot, too,</i>

15:47.347 --> 15:50.817
<i>or lost his mind during pon farr
and went insane.</i>

15:52.785 --> 15:54.654
Oh, come on. That was funny.

15:54.754 --> 15:57.456
<i>
And the very serious human
you stuck him with...</i>

15:57.457 --> 15:59.192
Reel it in anytime.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.528
<i>...she's got a stick
so far up her backside,</i>

16:01.628 --> 16:03.530
<i>it's coming out her mouth.</i>

16:03.630 --> 16:05.065
Just reel it in.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.070
<i>That would be</i>

16:10.203 --> 16:13.173
- Lieutenant Garrett.
- Mmm.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.075
Starfleet.

16:15.208 --> 16:19.746
Where fun goes to die.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.882
It took you long enough
to find me.

16:23.016 --> 16:26.019
We knew that having you here
on the <i>Baraam</i>

16:26.119 --> 16:28.320
would be valuable to us one day.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.924
Well, I'm not feeling motivated
to be valuable

16:32.059 --> 16:34.894
to anyone but myself.

16:37.997 --> 16:42.102
<i>♪ Say yes tonight ♪</i>

16:42.202 --> 16:45.238
<i>♪ Say yes to everything... ♪</i>

16:45.338 --> 16:48.908
So, is this where
we start negotiating?

16:49.008 --> 16:51.210
Hmm, that depends.

16:51.211 --> 16:53.380
How long have you known
about me?

16:54.081 --> 16:56.116
Ever since you took over
from the previous owner,

16:56.216 --> 16:57.850
who we still haven't found.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.186
Well, all of.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.288
- That wasn't me.
- Emperor Georgiou,

17:01.421 --> 17:03.790
I am authorized to arrest you

17:03.890 --> 17:05.792
and wipe your mind clean.

17:05.892 --> 17:07.260
But then again,
there's a part of me

17:07.394 --> 17:09.662
that wants you to live
with your memories.

17:09.762 --> 17:12.265
The genocidal ones.

17:13.766 --> 17:16.103
Being authorized to arrest me

17:16.203 --> 17:20.340
isn't the same
as being able to arrest me.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.110
You really want Section 31--
want me--

17:23.210 --> 17:24.944
dogging you
until the end of time?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.380
Boring.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.717
The past always
catches up with you.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.884
And as much as both of us

17:32.885 --> 17:35.122
might hate it,
I'm doing you a favor.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.491
One last mission.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.627
Listen.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.630
Do you believe in fate?

17:43.763 --> 17:45.332
Because I do.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.667
You can't hide from it.

17:48.535 --> 17:51.070
You're nothing here, Georgiou.

17:54.174 --> 17:57.177
I'm giving you a chance
to get back in.

17:57.277 --> 18:00.247
In on the action
on a galactic scale.

18:00.347 --> 18:02.682
Stop running from it.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.053
Be who you are.

18:09.256 --> 18:13.360
Or stay and tend bar
for eternity.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.499
Let's get on with it.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.682
<i>
Philippa Georgiou, meet my team.</i>

18:35.782 --> 18:37.517
This is Melle.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.021
Zeph.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.291
You look like
a Swiss Army knife.

18:44.391 --> 18:47.194
Uh, hold on.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.861
I don't know what that means,
but I'm not gonna

18:48.961 --> 18:50.096
just stand here
and get insulted.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.564
I'm not talking about you.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.533
I'm talking about your suit.

18:55.034 --> 18:56.536
Um, you're new,

18:56.636 --> 18:58.571
so I'm gonna just explain
this one time

18:58.705 --> 19:01.474
that when you are
talking about the suit,

19:01.574 --> 19:02.975
you're talking about Zeph.

19:03.075 --> 19:04.211
- Oh.
-Zeph suffers from

19:04.311 --> 19:05.878
what we call mecha dysmorphia.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.880
And I may not know what that is,

19:07.980 --> 19:09.282
but I'm also not gonna take that

19:09.382 --> 19:10.983
from you, Quas,
and personally I'm offended.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.484
- I think you should know...
- Well, it's accurate.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.653
It's not a diagnosis.
You're not a doctor.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.054
Zeph. Zeph, Zeph!

19:15.154 --> 19:16.389
- He knows. He knows. He knows.
- Okay, fine.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.424
He knows.

19:17.557 --> 19:18.758
- He gets it. He gets it.
- Yes.

19:18.858 --> 19:21.294
Okay, what about that Vulcan?

19:22.329 --> 19:23.763
Nobody told her?

19:24.664 --> 19:26.766
This?
The thing you're talking to?

19:26.866 --> 19:28.935
The Vulcan's just a machine.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.903
I'm inside.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.039
Driving.

19:41.113 --> 19:44.116
I control the body
from a backup vehicle.

19:44.217 --> 19:47.018
Yeah, something I use
to get into tight spots.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.187
Hi there.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.223
I'm Fuzz.

19:52.359 --> 19:53.859
Fuzz is a Nanokin.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.361
Real fun-loving guy.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.728
Hello.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.931
Except for when he's not.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.699
Then he's deranged with
an anger management problem.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.135
Well, you could've stopped
at the first thing, Quasi.

20:04.271 --> 20:06.473
A bootleg Vulcan conveyance?

20:06.573 --> 20:10.243
You must see cool stuff
on the black market.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.944
Nanokins are pretty scavengery.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.913
31 made first contact when

20:14.013 --> 20:15.882
we discovered an infestation
on a derelict ship.

20:15.982 --> 20:17.850
- Quasi.
- Oh, shit.

20:17.950 --> 20:21.288
Say "infestation"
one more time, Quasi.

20:21.388 --> 20:24.391
Say "scavenger,"
you sack of amorphous soot!

20:24.491 --> 20:26.158
I-I s-- I heard it
as soon as I said it.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.560
I will kick your ass

20:27.660 --> 20:29.562
until you cannot form
a solid mass of...

20:29.662 --> 20:31.464
Fuzz. Fuzz. Lock it down.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.132
I am locked down.

20:33.232 --> 20:39.372
I'm trapped inside
a giant robot Vulcan head.

20:39.472 --> 20:42.809
No one is more locked down
than me right now!

20:42.942 --> 20:45.478
Nanokins have
a wonky emotional spectrum.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.480
No, no, no, no, no, no,
I will not

20:47.614 --> 20:48.781
be condescended to, Melle,

20:48.881 --> 20:50.449
particularly not by you,
because honest...

20:50.450 --> 20:52.519
<i>MELLE
I love you. You are everything.</i>

20:52.619 --> 20:54.252
- Does my spectrum work for you?
-Fuzz.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.723
- I mean, like, like,
are you into it or...
- Fuzz!

20:56.823 --> 20:57.789
Fuzz!

20:57.790 --> 21:00.292
She's insulting you, pal.

21:00.293 --> 21:01.994
I know Deltans are gonna do
their Deltan thing,

21:02.094 --> 21:04.196
but have a little self-respect,
would you?

21:04.331 --> 21:05.498
Can we continue?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.199
And that's
Lieutenant Rachel Garrett.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.669
She is detailed to Section 31
for this one mission only.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.539
Who did you piss off to get
stuck in black ops, Lieutenant?

21:12.672 --> 21:16.975
Starfleet is here to make sure
we color inside the lines.

21:16.976 --> 21:19.346
Starfleet is here
to defend the Federation,

21:19.446 --> 21:22.349
keep the peace and make sure
no one commits murder.

21:22.449 --> 21:24.884
-  And you?
- One moment.

21:25.017 --> 21:26.318
Quasi came on my radar

21:26.319 --> 21:28.855
when he proved the existence
of glioclusters.

21:28.955 --> 21:32.659
Glioclusters are theoretical.

21:32.759 --> 21:34.292
Formerly theoretical.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.963
Life is just
branching possibilities.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.098
You know, they bloom and blossom
any way you can imagine.

21:39.198 --> 21:42.234
For example, I could be
intimidated by you right now.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.270
I mean, after all,
you've murdered

21:44.371 --> 21:45.804
so many people...

21:45.805 --> 21:48.974
and you seem to be staring
right into my soul.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.644
I could respond to that

21:51.744 --> 21:53.079
or I could observe my feelings
right now,

21:53.179 --> 21:55.681
lock it away
and do what I need to do.

21:55.682 --> 21:58.485
- Or...
- Quas. Pick one. Hmm?

21:58.585 --> 22:00.219
-Yes.
-Sometimes Quasi sees

22:00.319 --> 22:03.155
- so many options
he gets brain-freeze.
- Thank you, Melle.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.225
- Quasi, can we carry on, please?
- Mm-hmm.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.261
Our target's name is Dada Noe.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.996
Dubious moral compass.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.733
Ran a pathology lab on the Watt
Colonies before he went rogue.

22:13.833 --> 22:17.236
Since then, he's been
designing bioweapons on spec.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.939
Noe's on his way to the <i>Baraam</i>
to sell his latest creation

22:20.039 --> 22:21.608
to the Minosian High Council.

22:21.708 --> 22:24.611
There are no formal hostilities
with the Minosian Sway,

22:24.711 --> 22:26.413
but that could change
if they get their hands

22:26.513 --> 22:27.880
on a superweapon.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.749
Do we know what
this bio superweapon is?

22:29.882 --> 22:31.851
No, but if Dada Noe is
selling it, it's bad.

22:31.951 --> 22:35.455
So you're here to make sure
the sale never happens.

22:36.789 --> 22:37.824
How?

22:37.924 --> 22:40.292
Things went south
when you spotted us,

22:40.393 --> 22:43.496
but the plan is still solid.

22:43.596 --> 22:46.766
First, Alok was going to...

22:46.899 --> 22:48.635
You can say it.

22:49.636 --> 22:50.970
Connect.

22:51.103 --> 22:53.105
With you.

22:53.239 --> 22:56.008
- Welcome! Mmm.
- Yes.

22:59.245 --> 23:00.813
What a cute idea.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.215
Once we had you
suitably distracted,

23:03.315 --> 23:06.285
Quasi would do
the other thing Quasi does.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.455
Okay, Quasi.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.257
- If you would do the honors.
- Absolutely.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.299
Let's get to work.

23:26.338 --> 23:28.340
Welcome, Dada Noe.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.577
This is where Fuzz comes in.

23:35.147 --> 23:38.718
<i>
You wouldn't believe
the tiny spots I can get into.</i>

23:38.818 --> 23:43.222
<i>For example, the inner workings
of body modifications.</i>

23:43.355 --> 23:45.725
Oh, once I fly inside
Dada's body mod,

23:45.858 --> 23:47.860
well, then it's time
to get to work.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.196
So many circuits.

23:50.296 --> 23:51.931
So many things
that could go wrong.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.833
Competency crusader here
will talk me through

23:54.834 --> 23:56.301
the tech on the implant.

23:56.302 --> 23:58.471
And if I think we're putting
Dada Noe's life in danger

23:58.571 --> 23:59.872
by tinkering with that implant,

23:59.972 --> 24:02.408
I will unleash
the full weight of Starfleet

24:02.542 --> 24:04.076
on this whole operation.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.312
Oy, we're talking about a bloke
who's selling superweapons

24:06.412 --> 24:08.313
to any third-rate terrorist
with a Latinum card.

24:08.314 --> 24:10.149
Listen carefully, Junkyard.

24:10.249 --> 24:13.085
Starfleet does not do
assassinations.

24:13.219 --> 24:15.755
Ay, don't get your
prime directives in a bunch.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.124
You are not going to get
your hands dirty

24:18.224 --> 24:20.259
and mess up your chances
of becoming captain.

24:20.359 --> 24:21.794
I'm a top-tier science officer.

24:21.894 --> 24:23.863
- Butt pretzel.
-  Tight-ass.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.732
So disrespectful.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.867
Soon as Garrett and Fuzz
sever that link...

24:30.002 --> 24:33.005
<i>...he'll be under our control,
and I'll take him down</i>

24:33.105 --> 24:36.408
- with the help of Zeph.
- Mm.

24:40.680 --> 24:43.082
- That's what I call a hit.
- One.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.216
Dada Noe and his pathogen
will be in custody

24:45.217 --> 24:48.054
before the buyers can even
show up to the <i>Baraam.</i>

24:48.154 --> 24:50.322
And we are in and out.

24:50.422 --> 24:52.959
Mm. Meh.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.294
Meh?

24:55.427 --> 24:57.429
I have a simpler idea.

24:57.564 --> 25:00.600
<i>♪ Desperate, I can tell ♪</i>

25:00.700 --> 25:02.702
<i>♪ All that begging ♪</i>

25:02.802 --> 25:04.837
<i>♪ Suits you well. ♪</i>

25:05.672 --> 25:07.706
<i>♪ Blowing up my phone now ♪</i>

25:07.707 --> 25:09.809
<i>♪ Going up, you bow down ♪</i>

25:09.942 --> 25:12.377
<i>♪ Look at who needs who... ♪</i>

25:12.378 --> 25:15.014
Welcome, Monsieur Dada Noe.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.784
We're honored to have you here
at the <i>Baraam.</i>

25:17.884 --> 25:20.653
I am Veronique du Franc,
the proprietor.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.655
I told them to have
my suite ready.

25:22.789 --> 25:23.890
<i>Mais oui, monsieur.</i>

25:23.990 --> 25:26.224
May I escort you
to your quarters?

25:26.225 --> 25:27.660
Come.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.997
<i>We have the most exquisite...</i>

25:31.130 --> 25:32.598
I can't believe
you're trusting this sociopath.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.099
<i>ALOK
Well, Lieutenant,</i>

25:34.100 --> 25:35.400
<i>you got to do
what you got to do,</i>

25:35.401 --> 25:36.502
and I'm kind of familiar
with sociopaths.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.838
I said don't bring me.

25:40.840 --> 25:43.342
I trust your trip
was without incident, monsieur.

25:43.475 --> 25:46.646
Well, your people made
everything easy.

25:46.746 --> 25:49.281
Our pleasure. Here we are.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.956
So tacky.

25:57.957 --> 26:00.727
But I guess that's
what you're known for.

26:05.965 --> 26:06.999
What's this?

26:07.099 --> 26:08.367
It's called a phase pod.

26:08.500 --> 26:11.003
A client of mine
gave it to me as a gift,

26:11.103 --> 26:13.438
and I got one for myself, too.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.684
What are you doing?

26:24.784 --> 26:26.352
Everything in the universe
vibrates

26:26.452 --> 26:27.953
on a certain wavelength.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.355
Damn it.

26:31.457 --> 26:32.859
Give me back my case.

26:32.959 --> 26:34.360
No.

26:35.628 --> 26:38.463
That's coming out of
your security deposit.

26:38.464 --> 26:41.367
The phase pod changes
the wavelength

26:41.467 --> 26:43.069
of whatever they touch.

26:43.202 --> 26:46.305
I am out of phase with you,
and you're out of phase with me.

26:46.405 --> 26:50.509
I am, however, in phase
with your case.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.214
And I will be taking it with me.

26:55.347 --> 26:59.118
You have no idea
what you've started.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.989
Whoopsie.

27:08.527 --> 27:09.861
Impressive.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.463
Are you sure you're human?

27:12.564 --> 27:13.599
Most days.

27:13.700 --> 27:15.234
Thank you.

27:48.134 --> 27:50.970
Give me the case.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.336
Who are you?

28:34.480 --> 28:37.282
He went that way. That way,
that way, that way, that way!

28:48.360 --> 28:49.829
Oh, aliens.

28:49.962 --> 28:51.429
- Naked aliens.
-Go, Zeph, go.

29:10.716 --> 29:13.685
He's headed to the lounge.
Man, they're moving fast.

29:13.786 --> 29:15.453
<i>
Melle, he's coming to you.</i>

29:18.390 --> 29:19.191
Yikes.

29:28.634 --> 29:29.968
No, it's okay.

29:29.969 --> 29:31.537
- I'm all right.
- Melle, you got him?

29:31.670 --> 29:33.739
Got him.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.876
Ooh-la-la!

29:37.009 --> 29:38.610
Ay, amor.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.342
That's not possible.

31:50.442 --> 31:51.877
I had that destroyed.

31:51.978 --> 31:54.145
No. No!

31:56.282 --> 31:57.649
It's not possible.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.185
You knew that weapon.

31:59.285 --> 32:01.253
What is it?

32:02.921 --> 32:04.723
What is it?

32:06.825 --> 32:09.595
Fine. The hard way.

32:42.161 --> 32:44.396
The Eternal Supplicant
begs approach.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.765
You have my permission.

32:54.006 --> 32:56.575
All hail
Her Most Imperial Majesty,

32:56.675 --> 32:57.909
Mother of the Fatherland,

32:58.010 --> 33:00.079
- Overlord of Vulc--
- What is it?

33:01.180 --> 33:03.082
It is finished, Your Majesty.

33:06.152 --> 33:07.786
Where are my engineers?

33:09.155 --> 33:13.692
They... they took
their own lives upon completion.

33:18.630 --> 33:21.300
Who is the tear for, San?

33:23.402 --> 33:25.271
Speak.

33:25.371 --> 33:28.474
It is for you, Majesty.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.510
It is all...

33:33.645 --> 33:35.314
...for you.

33:44.256 --> 33:46.992
I asked you a question, San.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.462
Why do you cry for me?

33:53.832 --> 33:55.801
Look at me.

33:59.638 --> 34:03.475
Do you remember who we were?

34:04.343 --> 34:06.645
Before all this.

34:06.745 --> 34:09.580
The curious boy.

34:09.581 --> 34:12.351
The innocent girl.

34:13.319 --> 34:15.587
I only remember
my failure, Majesty.

34:15.687 --> 34:18.657
Don't lie to me.

34:20.692 --> 34:23.429
We were the only ones
who could understand

34:23.529 --> 34:26.931
the cost to stay alive.

34:26.932 --> 34:29.668
We made a team.

34:29.768 --> 34:33.172
We needed each other, didn't we?

34:33.272 --> 34:37.108
What did we say
to carry each other through,

34:37.109 --> 34:39.310
to survive together?

34:39.311 --> 34:41.147
We are two...

34:42.814 --> 34:44.550
But one.

34:44.650 --> 34:47.186
We are two but one.

34:47.286 --> 34:49.355
If I said then,

34:49.455 --> 34:50.856
"Let's run away,

34:50.956 --> 34:52.391
"let's flee this competition

34:52.524 --> 34:55.660
and everything
that binds us to Terra,"

34:55.661 --> 34:58.029
what would you have said?

34:58.130 --> 34:59.531
Hmm?

35:01.200 --> 35:05.404
The timing of your question
is more poetic than you know.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.776
I would have said yes.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.050
Then.

35:21.086 --> 35:22.821
But now?

35:23.889 --> 35:29.228
You could have made something
beautiful with your reign.

35:29.328 --> 35:31.963
Instead, you chose
to build this.

35:32.063 --> 35:34.999
That means
that innocent girl I knew,

35:35.000 --> 35:37.569
she has been...

35:37.669 --> 35:39.471
...murdered.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.608
What is this?

35:44.075 --> 35:45.543
You...

35:45.544 --> 35:48.380
You took the same poison?

35:50.015 --> 35:52.551
No! I forbid you to die!

35:52.651 --> 35:55.587
No one wants to live

35:55.687 --> 35:59.124
in your world, Emperor.

35:59.225 --> 36:02.294
You are a monster!

36:29.621 --> 36:32.924
And what delightful place
is this?

36:33.024 --> 36:34.326
A safe house.

36:34.426 --> 36:37.228
But maybe not so safe for you.

36:37.229 --> 36:38.630
You are Section 31.

36:38.730 --> 36:42.301
Why aren't you
torturing answers out of me?

36:42.434 --> 36:43.635
You're a tyrant.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.003
A real one.

36:45.136 --> 36:46.505
Torture wouldn't work.

36:46.605 --> 36:49.940
How do you know so much
about people like me?

36:49.941 --> 36:51.442
Hmm?

36:51.443 --> 36:55.647
You learned tyranny somewhere,
and you learned hard.

36:55.781 --> 36:59.017
If you have to hide it,
that's a weakness.

37:01.487 --> 37:04.088
And I can't have that
in a partner.

37:04.089 --> 37:06.325
- We're not partners.
- No?

37:06.425 --> 37:08.226
I've been very helpful.

37:08.327 --> 37:10.028
You had a plan
that couldn't work.

37:10.161 --> 37:11.330
I gave you a better one.

37:11.430 --> 37:13.799
You gave me
a taste of the action,

37:13.899 --> 37:15.701
knowing I'd want more.

37:17.336 --> 37:18.837
You need me.

37:18.970 --> 37:21.206
You chose me.

37:23.174 --> 37:24.276
Why?

37:24.376 --> 37:26.545
Whatever you believed
your mission was,

37:26.645 --> 37:28.614
it's worse than you thought.

37:28.714 --> 37:33.084
Billions of lives are at stake,
and time is short.

37:33.184 --> 37:37.088
Tell me you,
and I will tell you me.

37:37.188 --> 37:39.491
The only way this works
is if I know

37:39.591 --> 37:43.795
exactly who I'm dealing with.

37:54.940 --> 37:57.609
I'm not from this time, either.

37:58.410 --> 38:01.079
I was born on Earth,
20th century.

38:01.179 --> 38:04.650
You are 350 years old?

38:04.750 --> 38:06.051
More or less.

38:06.151 --> 38:08.587
I slept most of that time.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.557
After my exile.

38:14.360 --> 38:16.562
The Eugenics Wars.

38:18.597 --> 38:22.734
Augments...

38:22.868 --> 38:24.470
took my planet.

38:25.771 --> 38:27.773
My home.

38:33.044 --> 38:36.147
There was maybe ten of us
who fought.

38:36.247 --> 38:39.718
Everyone I knew
either took a bullet or a blade.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.953
But I gave some back.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.457
She noticed me.

38:46.425 --> 38:49.860
The Augment
who slaughtered my family.

38:49.861 --> 38:54.933
They called her Giri the Marked.

38:55.066 --> 38:56.901
She took me in.

38:56.902 --> 39:00.105
Made me stronger than
any human should be.

39:00.205 --> 39:01.640
She ripped me apart

39:01.773 --> 39:05.242
and turned me into
another Augment for her army.

39:05.243 --> 39:08.346
And I did terrible things.

39:08.447 --> 39:12.751
All for a monster like you.

39:14.420 --> 39:19.124
Because for tyrants,
there is only one choice:

39:19.224 --> 39:21.560
murder.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.163
You haven't killed me.

39:26.264 --> 39:27.633
Yet.

39:32.638 --> 39:38.710
I recognized the weapon because
I ordered it to be built.

39:40.479 --> 39:42.481
Gather your people.

39:42.614 --> 39:45.150
We're gonna need
every one of them.

40:21.119 --> 40:24.523
In my universe,
there were always plotters.

40:24.623 --> 40:26.191
Always a coup.

40:26.291 --> 40:30.361
So I built a weapon
to end all threats.

40:30.462 --> 40:34.199
I called it the Godsend.

40:34.299 --> 40:36.902
It triggers a chain reaction,

40:37.002 --> 40:39.538
like a virus passing
between planets.

40:39.638 --> 40:42.306
Everything in its path
incinerates.

40:42.307 --> 40:44.876
An entire quadrant
would be lost.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.245
If my enemies managed
to kill me,

40:47.378 --> 40:50.448
there would be
nothing left to rule.

40:53.084 --> 40:54.219
Yeah, hi. Quick question.

40:54.319 --> 40:55.587
Sorry.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.556
Yeah, no. Uh, just a qu--
it's just a quick one.

40:57.656 --> 41:01.259
Is it Godsend or God's End?

41:01.359 --> 41:03.261
Godsend or God's End?

41:03.361 --> 41:04.662
I don't hear a difference
in what you're saying.

41:04.663 --> 41:08.099
Really? Really?
Godsend. God's End.

41:08.233 --> 41:10.368
- Yeah, I'm still not getting it.
- The Godsend is...

41:10.468 --> 41:11.836
Wait, Godsend. I hear it now.

41:11.837 --> 41:13.772
- It's Godsend. No apostrophe.
- Send.

41:13.872 --> 41:15.440
The Godsend is here.

41:15.541 --> 41:17.743
How? It's from another universe.

41:17.876 --> 41:19.510
I don't know,
but that man had it.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.312
The one that you think
is Dada Noe.

41:21.412 --> 41:23.248
The one we know is Dada Noe.

41:23.348 --> 41:26.383
No, he's not your Dada Noe.
He can't be.

41:26.384 --> 41:29.353
He's from the Terran Empire,
and he brought the Godsend here.

41:29.354 --> 41:32.658
That's the only way
he can know about it.

41:32.758 --> 41:34.159
And since we have him
locked up tight,

41:34.259 --> 41:35.961
- I'll interrogate him.
-No, no, no.

41:36.061 --> 41:38.362
- We cannot trust
a single word this woman says.
- Yeah.

41:38.363 --> 41:39.865
She cost us Melle.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.800
She's the only one who knows
what we're dealing with.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.769
Yeah, well, so she says,
little bro.

41:43.869 --> 41:45.203
Little?

41:45.303 --> 41:46.905
Scale-shamer!

41:47.005 --> 41:48.640
Microbes outlasted dinosaurs!

41:48.774 --> 41:50.308
Calm your boots.
What I'm saying is...

41:50.441 --> 41:53.711
I will piss in your suit
until you go all rusty like!

41:53.712 --> 41:55.380
...that she's the reason
this is all bollixed up.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.348
She's the reason Melle's dead,
and she's the reason

41:57.448 --> 41:58.650
we're in the ass end
of the galaxy.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.018
Listen up.

42:02.087 --> 42:04.790
Georgiou and I are
gonna go back to the ship.

42:04.923 --> 42:08.225
Dada Noe is our only link
to the Godsend,

42:08.226 --> 42:11.329
<i>so we're gonna have
a little chat with him.</i>

42:23.842 --> 42:25.010
What?

42:25.143 --> 42:27.077
Her name is Philippa Georgiou,

42:27.078 --> 42:28.847
Her Most Imperial Majesty.

42:28.980 --> 42:30.748
Mother of the Fatherland.

42:30.749 --> 42:32.050
Overlord of Vulcan.

42:32.150 --> 42:34.519
Dominus of Qo'noS, Regina Andor,

42:34.620 --> 42:38.088
Philippa Georgiou
Augustus Iaponius Centarius.

42:38.089 --> 42:39.190
Cool.

42:39.324 --> 42:40.491
That come with fries?

42:40.592 --> 42:42.927
That was good, right?

42:44.295 --> 42:46.164
Okay.

42:46.264 --> 42:49.133
Every time you don't answer
her questions directly,

42:49.134 --> 42:52.270
Her Majesty will punch you
in your face.

42:52.370 --> 42:54.239
Fine.

42:54.339 --> 42:56.141
I'm Dada.

42:56.241 --> 42:58.308
Dada Noe. Just Dada, then Noe.

42:58.309 --> 42:59.711
That's it. No in-betweens.

42:59.845 --> 43:02.112
And I, uh...

43:02.113 --> 43:06.517
I used to run a pathology lab
in the Watt Colonies.

43:12.290 --> 43:13.791
What the shit, man?!

43:13.792 --> 43:16.895
You said that she was gonna be
doing the face punching!

43:17.028 --> 43:20.431
So now we both have lied.
You are not that Dada.

43:21.967 --> 43:24.235
You're what these people call
his Mirror.

43:25.871 --> 43:28.039
You came here
from the Terran Empire,

43:28.173 --> 43:30.474
and you brought the Godsend.

43:30.475 --> 43:32.210
What's the Godsend?

43:33.611 --> 43:35.947
My own war council
tried to depose me.

43:36.047 --> 43:39.250
Do you know how I convinced
the field marshal to talk?

43:39.384 --> 43:41.186
Hmm?

43:48.093 --> 43:49.327
I was an administrator

43:49.427 --> 43:51.229
at an Imperial weapons facility
on Terra.

43:51.362 --> 43:52.597
Uh, yeah.

43:52.698 --> 43:56.234
The Godsend was stored
at my facility.

43:57.235 --> 44:01.038
Most thought it was a legend,
but I knew it was real.

44:01.039 --> 44:02.741
So you tried to sell it.

44:02.874 --> 44:04.174
Yeah, yeah.

44:04.175 --> 44:07.779
I wanted to live here quietly
on its proceeds.

44:07.913 --> 44:09.580
How did you get to our universe?

44:09.715 --> 44:11.016
Hmm?

44:13.785 --> 44:15.553
There was an ion storm.

44:15.653 --> 44:17.588
Two of them, actually.

44:17.689 --> 44:20.125
And when they converged,
which they do like clockwork,

44:20.258 --> 44:23.393
they ripped something open
on the fringes of the Empire--

44:23.394 --> 44:28.099
an anomaly, they called it--
but it was a passageway

44:28.199 --> 44:31.136
to get to this place
from the Terran Empire.

44:32.470 --> 44:36.307
Comes out through
your Crescent Nebula.

44:36.407 --> 44:38.609
Few know about it. For now.

44:38.710 --> 44:41.479
But it'll open again
in four hours.

44:41.579 --> 44:44.149
That's when I was supposed to be
meeting my buyer.

44:44.249 --> 44:46.084
Are you aware of
what that weapon does?

44:46.184 --> 44:48.619
The Terran Empire's burned
through its resources.

44:48.720 --> 44:49.855
There's famine.

44:49.955 --> 44:52.523
Entire ecologies are collapsing.

44:52.623 --> 44:54.925
They need to find
a new territory

44:54.926 --> 44:56.661
to conquer and strip-mine.

44:56.795 --> 44:59.229
When they realize that
their superweapon is gone,

44:59.230 --> 45:00.966
they're gonna find
that passageway--

45:01.066 --> 45:02.667
you know they will--
and they'll come

45:02.768 --> 45:06.304
and they'll burn everything
they touch and enslave the rest,

45:06.404 --> 45:09.507
because that's
what the Empire does, Majesty.

45:10.508 --> 45:13.178
They learned well from you.

45:14.746 --> 45:16.446
Who else wants it?

45:16.447 --> 45:18.549
I-I don't know, man.

45:18.649 --> 45:20.919
I got an offer.
The money was real.

45:21.019 --> 45:23.154
Someone stole the Godsend
from us.

45:23.288 --> 45:25.255
- Who was he?
-No idea.

45:25.256 --> 45:28.626
Whoever broke into my room,
whoever stole that weapon,

45:28.726 --> 45:30.495
they know what they know
because they learned it

45:30.595 --> 45:32.163
from one of you.

45:51.616 --> 45:54.452
ALOK
Emergency transporter.

46:28.386 --> 46:30.221
Well, this is great.

46:31.089 --> 46:32.590
Oh, even better.

46:32.690 --> 46:34.960
Is that... is that the ship?
Is the ship gone?

46:35.060 --> 46:36.261
I liked that ship.

46:36.394 --> 46:38.096
What happened?

46:38.196 --> 46:39.931
Sabotage.

46:43.168 --> 46:44.534
What?

46:44.535 --> 46:47.105
Whoever stole the Godsend
had a partner.

46:47.238 --> 46:49.607
It was someone here.

46:51.042 --> 46:53.979
Which means one of us is a mole.

46:59.117 --> 47:01.752
- Could be you.
- Could be you.

47:01.853 --> 47:03.187
If it were me,

47:03.188 --> 47:05.423
I would have murdered
all of you already.

47:05.523 --> 47:07.893
Look, boss, if there's a mole,
you know it's not me.

47:07.993 --> 47:09.894
I mean, that sounds
pretty moley to me.

47:09.895 --> 47:11.462
I don't know.

47:11.562 --> 47:13.231
We've been on
like ten ops together.

47:13.331 --> 47:15.033
Yeah, and I still don't even
know what you look like, do I?

47:15.133 --> 47:16.935
No one knows
what a Chameloid looks like.

47:17.035 --> 47:19.904
- You might change
into anything you want.
- What about Fuzz, huh?

47:19.905 --> 47:21.940
- He exists on a whole other
scale than anybody else.
- Mm, deflecting?

47:22.073 --> 47:25.409
My wife is about to lay
our first litter of egg sacs.

47:25.410 --> 47:28.579
- No, I have 190,000 hatchlings
on the way...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.247
- ...and I want them to live.
- Well, look,

47:30.248 --> 47:31.748
you could find
a motive for any of us.

47:31.749 --> 47:34.485
Or it could be a combination
of any of you.

47:34.619 --> 47:36.454
You know, like-like Zeph
and-and Fuzz or...

47:36.554 --> 47:38.055
You are spinning out
without Melle.

47:38.056 --> 47:39.724
You cannot land on a choice.

47:39.824 --> 47:41.859
Maybe you're putting that in
my head because you're the mole.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.461
Huh? How about Garrett?
She's new.

47:43.561 --> 47:44.662
She doesn't care about us.

47:44.795 --> 47:46.197
I'm Starfleet.

47:46.297 --> 47:49.900
Whoa. Anyone else feel
that heroic breeze right there

47:49.901 --> 47:51.302
ruffling her cape?

47:51.436 --> 47:53.604
Okay, there's an old ship
out there,

47:53.704 --> 47:54.940
an old garbage scow.

47:55.040 --> 47:56.641
Yeah, I found it
when you were up there

47:56.741 --> 47:58.242
interrogating metal head.

47:58.243 --> 47:59.744
Must be years
since anyone flew it,

47:59.844 --> 48:01.112
but I think we can work with it

48:01.212 --> 48:03.814
to go after
whoever took the Godsend.

48:03.915 --> 48:06.283
Mm. I dislike you less.

48:06.284 --> 48:07.685
Aw.

48:07.785 --> 48:09.320
If I wanted someone to like me,
I'd get a dog.

48:09.454 --> 48:10.587
I like order.

48:10.588 --> 48:13.024
I like prediction
and conclusion.

48:13.124 --> 48:17.261
Then you're on the wrong team
because we've got mole,

48:17.262 --> 48:19.430
stranded on a dead planet,

48:19.530 --> 48:21.132
no communication
with the outside,

48:21.232 --> 48:25.003
and less than four hours before
the Terrans get the Godsend

48:25.136 --> 48:27.005
and use it
anywhere in the galaxy.

48:27.105 --> 48:30.841
Speaking of which, Quas,
what about the antenna array?

48:30.942 --> 48:34.012
Uh, well...

48:35.246 --> 48:37.048
Well, it's a couple decades
out of date.

48:37.148 --> 48:40.284
We get it up and running,
then we tell 31 what's coming.

48:40.285 --> 48:41.552
We work together.

48:41.686 --> 48:43.754
- Everyone stays in sight.
-Yeah.

48:43.854 --> 48:45.723
Just...

48:49.327 --> 48:51.229
Let's go.

49:05.543 --> 49:07.478
Well, there goes that idea.

49:08.246 --> 49:10.815
Our little mole
has been really busy.

49:10.915 --> 49:12.516
Ripped up all the wiring.

49:12.517 --> 49:14.385
Two teams.
I'll lead one into the woods.

49:14.485 --> 49:16.754
Three to see if we can
salvage that scow.

49:16.887 --> 49:18.089
You stay here with the others

49:18.189 --> 49:19.656
and try and fix
the antenna array.

49:19.657 --> 49:21.892
Why is she giving us orders now?

49:22.027 --> 49:23.360
Because I'm letting her

49:23.361 --> 49:25.063
and I'm pretty certain
she's not the mole.

49:25.163 --> 49:26.797
You wouldn't bet on a horse
named Pretty Certain.

49:26.897 --> 49:30.835
Quas, Fuzz, you get to the scow
right away with Georgiou.

49:30.935 --> 49:32.603
Zeph and Garrett,
you stay here with me.

49:32.737 --> 49:34.205
We'll take care of
the antenna array.

49:34.305 --> 49:36.107
Uh, I'm sorry.

49:36.207 --> 49:37.642
I'm supposed to go
out into the woods

49:37.742 --> 49:39.344
with two people
who want to kill me?

49:39.444 --> 49:41.679
Just stay in sight of each other
and don't get dead.

49:41.779 --> 49:43.081
Okay?

49:43.181 --> 49:44.849
Yep, thanks, Cap.

49:44.949 --> 49:46.883
I mean, just fifty-fifty shot
one of them wants to kill me,

49:46.884 --> 49:49.220
- and then 25%...
- Quas, just get your ass
out there.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.455
I love you, too, Cap.

49:50.555 --> 49:52.423
-All righty.
-Aye, aye.

50:02.900 --> 50:04.935
<i>
The internal circuitry
on this old scow</i>

50:05.070 --> 50:07.305
is still in decent shape.

50:09.274 --> 50:12.643
Everything I'm seeing
should work.

50:14.879 --> 50:17.815
So this thing we're chasing,
the Godsend,

50:17.948 --> 50:20.951
your engineers,
did they install a fail-safe?

50:21.052 --> 50:23.121
Can we disable it remotely?

50:25.156 --> 50:28.393
There is no fail-safe.
I wouldn't allow it.

50:28.493 --> 50:30.695
How very on-brand for you.

50:30.795 --> 50:32.096
Can I ask you one more question?

50:32.097 --> 50:34.264
I'm just gonna ask you
one more question.

50:34.265 --> 50:36.801
So you brought the Godsend
into the world

50:36.934 --> 50:40.004
to vaporize
quadrillions of lives.

50:40.138 --> 50:43.908
Never thought that was
a little, you know, much?

50:46.010 --> 50:48.612
I ordered it destroyed.

50:48.613 --> 50:52.782
And someone hid it.
Your own people betrayed you.

50:52.783 --> 50:55.153
Well, your corporate culture
was straight-up shit.

50:55.286 --> 50:57.388
And you didn't answer
my question.

50:57.488 --> 50:59.857
The asymptote coil is gone.

51:00.958 --> 51:04.061
Someone must have scavenged it
for the terbium.

51:04.162 --> 51:07.098
Well, find another one,
this thing should fly.

51:07.198 --> 51:09.599
- Maybe the cargo hull.
- Huh. Oh, no, no.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.437
Everyone stays together,
all right?

51:12.537 --> 51:15.273
Limits the possibilities
of you killing us.

51:15.373 --> 51:17.175
Uh...

51:17.308 --> 51:19.109
Let's go to the cargo hold,
please.

51:19.110 --> 51:20.911
Aren't you coming?

51:21.011 --> 51:23.881
Yes. I couldn't be more excited.

51:26.851 --> 51:29.154
Yeah, I could help you
down there, of course,

51:29.254 --> 51:31.522
but considering how,
you know, control

51:31.622 --> 51:33.524
is central
to your entire identity

51:33.624 --> 51:35.526
and the fact that
I'm just not good at it,

51:35.660 --> 51:38.062
I'm just gonna stand here
and honor our relationship

51:38.196 --> 51:40.464
- by doing absolutely nothing.
-Helpful.

51:40.465 --> 51:42.166
It's called
radical self-acceptance.

51:42.167 --> 51:43.668
- Evolved of you.
- Well, thank you.

51:43.768 --> 51:45.236
So, can you fix it?

51:45.336 --> 51:49.207
I'm not even sure it's broken.
It's just missing a part.

51:49.307 --> 51:51.508
Look, this-this torn wiring
looks dramatic,

51:51.509 --> 51:53.411
but this equipment has
redundancy built in.

51:53.511 --> 51:54.912
There's an easy work-around.

51:55.012 --> 51:58.515
Except somebody ripped out
the theta junction.

51:58.516 --> 52:00.285
Other than that,
this thing should work.

52:00.385 --> 52:03.388
Okay, well,
maybe our mole has it.

52:08.058 --> 52:10.461
- Garrett?
- Yeah.

52:10.561 --> 52:11.729
Zeph.

52:11.862 --> 52:13.798
Where is Zeph?

52:21.272 --> 52:23.308
Zeph, come in.

52:24.175 --> 52:26.411
Zeph, do you copy?

52:33.751 --> 52:35.920
Zeph.

52:43.261 --> 52:44.862
Garrett, was that you?

52:48.433 --> 52:50.401
Garrett, what the hell was that?

52:50.501 --> 52:52.437
<i>GARRETT
Someone just activated
the antenna array.</i>

52:52.537 --> 52:54.404
Damn it.

52:54.405 --> 52:56.774
What's happening?

52:56.907 --> 52:59.277
Garrett, sitrep.

52:59.410 --> 53:01.612
This is going to be good.

53:01.712 --> 53:04.582
Lieutenant, do you copy? Over.

53:12.423 --> 53:13.791
Clear.

53:14.959 --> 53:16.394
Clear.

53:16.494 --> 53:17.894
Nothing here.

53:17.895 --> 53:20.431
How could someone have used this
to send out a signal?

53:20.531 --> 53:22.633
Impossible. It's missing a part.

53:22.733 --> 53:25.002
And someone shot it to hell.

53:25.135 --> 53:27.104
I heard someone running.

53:27.204 --> 53:29.006
Zeph must have put
the theta junction back in.

53:29.106 --> 53:31.442
Then shot it
after he used the array.

53:34.545 --> 53:37.315
So he must have circled back
after he went AWOL.

53:37.415 --> 53:41.652
Zeph came down
to this planet to sabotage us.

53:41.752 --> 53:43.521
And now that we're stranded,

53:43.621 --> 53:46.156
he sent a message
to whoever he's working with.

53:46.257 --> 53:48.158
And he'll lay low
until his ride gets here,

53:48.259 --> 53:49.927
and then he's long gone.

53:50.027 --> 53:52.497
Then we need to find him first.

54:00.471 --> 54:02.138
<i>ALOK
Observer, do you copy?</i>

54:02.139 --> 54:04.808
Please, Raider One,
when do I not copy?

54:04.809 --> 54:07.011
<i>That's funny. Status?</i>

54:08.946 --> 54:10.614
I'm picking up
a lot of interference,

54:10.615 --> 54:12.383
<i>but the tricorder shows
Zeph's biosignature</i>

54:12.517 --> 54:14.719
<i>was just in this sector. Over.</i>

54:15.620 --> 54:18.723
Copy.
Stay low and tight, people.

54:22.327 --> 54:25.663
The warlord you served, Giri,
what happened to her?

54:25.763 --> 54:27.732
She died like she lived.

54:27.832 --> 54:29.867
By that, you know what I mean.

54:29.967 --> 54:31.167
She was lucky.

54:31.168 --> 54:33.237
She wasn't infected
with a conscience.

54:33.371 --> 54:34.672
- Infected?
- Yeah.

54:34.772 --> 54:36.907
A monster can only be a monster.

54:37.007 --> 54:40.176
A monster with regrets
is useless.

54:40.177 --> 54:41.746
Mm. So that's why
you were hiding

54:41.879 --> 54:43.581
in a bar at the ass end
of nowhere.

54:43.714 --> 54:46.016
Maybe it's why
you're working with 31.

54:46.116 --> 54:47.752
To wipe your slate clean.

54:47.885 --> 54:50.321
There's always a price to pay
for people like us.

54:50.421 --> 54:52.323
You wouldn't be here
if you didn't agree.

54:52.423 --> 54:54.190
Oh, so that's why you chose me.

54:54.191 --> 54:56.894
You think I'm a monster who
feels enough to be controlled

54:56.994 --> 54:58.729
but still do
the real dirty work.

54:58.829 --> 55:01.165
No, I think you want the
Godsend back because you know

55:01.265 --> 55:02.767
it's your one chance
to redeem yourself

55:02.900 --> 55:04.402
for all the shit you've done.

55:04.502 --> 55:07.237
I want the Godsend back
because it's mine.

55:13.844 --> 55:17.748
Ah. Zeph's exoskeleton
is leaking.

55:23.754 --> 55:25.656
Yep, more.

55:30.361 --> 55:32.162
This way.

56:03.461 --> 56:06.563
Blip, Clip,

56:06.564 --> 56:08.499
Grip,

56:08.599 --> 56:11.802
Polio, Influensina,

56:11.936 --> 56:13.838
- Cowpox...
- What are you saying?

56:13.938 --> 56:16.774
I'm reciting the names
of me hatchlings.

56:16.874 --> 56:18.676
Since one of you
is going to murder me,

56:18.776 --> 56:22.279
I'm never gonna meet them,
but at least I can honor them

56:22.379 --> 56:23.648
one by one.

56:23.781 --> 56:25.149
Trip,

56:25.282 --> 56:26.551
Trip 2,

56:26.651 --> 56:30.721
Tonsilyitis, Crimean-Congo
Hemorrhagic Fever...

56:30.821 --> 56:32.557
Are you gonna sob out
190,000 names?

56:32.657 --> 56:34.725
How can you be so cold
and insensitive?

56:34.825 --> 56:36.494
Might he have recorded
what happened?

56:36.594 --> 56:38.028
Sure.

56:38.128 --> 56:39.963
Except the footage was probably
murdered along with him.

56:39.964 --> 56:43.000
We could connect one of
the tricorders to his suit.

56:43.133 --> 56:45.602
Whatever data is left,
we'll know who did this.

56:45.603 --> 56:48.473
You say that like
we're all suspects.

56:48.573 --> 56:50.139
We're not. All right?

56:50.140 --> 56:53.678
Fuzz, me and her were in the
scow when all this happened--

56:53.778 --> 56:56.080
everyone in sight
of everyone else.

56:56.180 --> 56:58.415
And nobody went anywhere, right?

56:58.516 --> 57:00.451
- Right.
-Hmm.

57:03.621 --> 57:06.624
Oh, this is not Zeph's.

57:06.724 --> 57:10.528
Brunette. 25 centimeters.

57:25.576 --> 57:27.211
This is insane.

57:27.344 --> 57:28.746
Stop fidgeting.

57:28.879 --> 57:30.380
I've been in close quarters
with Zeph for a week.

57:30.481 --> 57:32.082
Okay, so you're into
mecha boom-boom.

57:32.216 --> 57:34.218
Lots of humans are. No shame.

57:35.520 --> 57:37.287
Hmm.

57:41.458 --> 57:43.192
Well, that's impossible.

57:59.877 --> 58:01.679
Lieutenant Garrett,

58:01.779 --> 58:04.649
why is Zeph's blood
underneath your fingernails?

58:09.520 --> 58:11.421
Lieutenant Garrett,

58:11.556 --> 58:14.291
evidence from you
was found on Zeph's body,

58:14.391 --> 58:17.294
and evidence from Zeph's body
was found on you.

58:17.427 --> 58:19.697
Not very Starfleet.

58:19.797 --> 58:21.431
Oh, I am very Starfleet.

58:21.532 --> 58:24.033
And you know I didn't do this.

58:24.034 --> 58:27.605
You are just terrified of anyone
with a moral compass.

58:27.738 --> 58:28.906
Mm.

58:29.006 --> 58:32.843
And deep down
in that pure little heart,

58:32.943 --> 58:35.913
you're actually a chaos goblin,
aren't you?

58:36.013 --> 58:38.448
- I know you have it
in you, angel.
- Don't call me that.

58:38.549 --> 58:40.084
Starfleet sniffed you out

58:40.184 --> 58:42.953
and put you in a place
where you'd be most useful.

58:43.053 --> 58:47.390
Section 31 is just the place
for officers who bend the rules,

58:47.391 --> 58:50.628
never quite break them
until they do.

58:50.728 --> 58:54.464
And you fit right in here.

58:58.803 --> 59:00.971
You can torture me all you want.

59:01.071 --> 59:03.708
You will never make me
a murderer.

59:05.175 --> 59:06.911
No.

59:20.925 --> 59:22.627
We've got footage!

59:25.663 --> 59:26.997
<i>ZEPH
Stop!</i>

59:27.097 --> 59:28.833
<i>Stop!</i>

59:30.768 --> 59:32.169
<i>This is my suit.</i>

59:32.269 --> 59:34.504
<i>I am the suit!</i>

59:35.606 --> 59:37.974
<i>The suit is me!</i>

59:37.975 --> 59:39.509
<i>One second.</i>

59:43.013 --> 59:46.651
<i>We were your friends.
We were your friends.</i>

59:47.451 --> 59:49.452
<i>You can't kill me.</i>

59:49.453 --> 59:51.656
-Zeph, no.
<i>- You can't kill...</i>

59:57.094 --> 59:59.196
Zeph killed himself?

59:59.296 --> 01:00:00.831
Why would he do that?

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:06.236
Sorry to disappoint you,
Your Majesty.

01:00:07.037 --> 01:00:09.506
Look, none of this
is making any sense.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:10.941
No, none of it
makes a lick of sense.

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:12.576
Why would he do this? Uh...

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:14.544
- Give me a couple minutes to...
- We don't have minutes.

01:00:14.645 --> 01:00:16.881
Well, then give me
a couple seconds, then.

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:19.183
Uh...

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:21.218
- Could be you.
-Could be you.

01:00:21.318 --> 01:00:22.820
<i>
And I still don't even know
what you look like.</i>

01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.554
You could change into
anything you want.

01:00:24.689 --> 01:00:26.155
<i>
She's new.
She doesn't care about us.</i>

01:00:26.156 --> 01:00:27.857
- I'm Starfleet.
- Whoa.

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:29.226
<i>
When you are talking
about the suit,</i>

01:00:29.359 --> 01:00:31.061
you're talking about Zeph.

01:00:31.829 --> 01:00:33.063
<i>
This isn't Fuzz.</i>

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:34.998
The Vulcan's just a machine,
you know.

01:00:34.999 --> 01:00:36.532
I'm inside.

01:00:36.533 --> 01:00:38.135
Scale-shamer!

01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:40.738
<i>You wouldn't believe
the tiny spots I can get into.</i>

01:00:40.871 --> 01:00:45.875
<i>For example, the inner workings
of body modifications.</i>

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:47.376
There's an autopilot.

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:49.980
That's the only thing
that makes sense.

01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:55.953
You set the Vulcan machine
on autopilot.

01:00:57.454 --> 01:01:01.190
<i>That's why its responses
were so strange.</i>

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:04.128
- Aren't you coming?
- Yes.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:09.198
You flew into
Zeph's exoskeleton.

01:01:09.199 --> 01:01:11.101
And once you were inside...

01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:13.237
Somebody ripped out
the theta junction.

01:01:13.337 --> 01:01:15.205
Garrett, where's Zeph?

01:01:16.774 --> 01:01:19.643
<i>
Then you took control
of Zeph's suit.</i>

01:01:20.745 --> 01:01:22.880
<i>While the others were out
looking for him,</i>

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:25.581
<i>you made him sneak back
into the antenna array</i>

01:01:25.582 --> 01:01:28.052
<i>and send those messages.</i>

01:01:28.152 --> 01:01:30.087
Don't do this to them!

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:32.456
We were your friends.

01:01:32.556 --> 01:01:35.091
<i>
Then you destroyed the evidence.</i>

01:01:35.092 --> 01:01:36.626
<i>And you killed Zeph.</i>

01:01:38.428 --> 01:01:40.630
And then you planted
the evidence on Garrett here.

01:01:44.935 --> 01:01:46.470
Hands up, Fuzz.

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.840
Oh, shite and ever shite.

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:59.649
Whoa. You're honestly gonna
believe what she says, Alok?

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:01.585
Quasi, after everything
we've been through?

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:07.391
C-Can I just say
one thing first?

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:14.264
I'm still hacked into
Zeph's exoskeleton.

01:02:27.978 --> 01:02:29.579
Come on!

01:02:33.117 --> 01:02:36.053
What happened to
"no crew member left behind"?

01:02:37.721 --> 01:02:39.523
Oh.

01:02:53.303 --> 01:02:54.872
Come on, come on!

01:02:55.005 --> 01:02:56.106
Get us closer.

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:08.979
I got you. I got you.

01:04:09.113 --> 01:04:11.715
- Nice and easy.
-Damn.

01:05:10.274 --> 01:05:12.542
You keep tabs
on the black market, hmm?

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:14.478
And that's where you heard
about the Godsend.

01:05:14.578 --> 01:05:15.845
Why do you care?

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:17.747
You killed your family.

01:05:17.847 --> 01:05:19.516
What's a few billion
more people, huh?

01:05:19.616 --> 01:05:22.419
Where is it?
And who are you working with?

01:05:22.519 --> 01:05:25.288
You took your crown
while they died in agony

01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:27.424
not ten feet away.

01:05:28.192 --> 01:05:31.361
You condemned
your only friend to slavery,

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:35.164
and then you had the balls to
offer him kindness at the end?

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:39.236
How could you know that?

01:05:39.369 --> 01:05:42.039
Glad you're catching on.

01:05:42.139 --> 01:05:44.008
He played you, Emperor.

01:05:44.108 --> 01:05:46.043
San's alive.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.183
It's not possible.

01:05:55.019 --> 01:05:56.786
That's not possible. How?

01:05:56.886 --> 01:05:59.456
He built up an immunity
from that poison, you know.

01:05:59.556 --> 01:06:02.726
Teeny tiny doses over time.

01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:07.363
Once again, small shite
for the win, mama.

01:06:08.532 --> 01:06:10.300
Where is he?!

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.936
He's gonna put on
quite the show.

01:06:13.037 --> 01:06:15.072
You built the Godsend.

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:16.940
You made this monster.

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:19.209
This is all you.

01:07:02.586 --> 01:07:04.754
Be careful, all right?

01:07:05.555 --> 01:07:07.390
I said be careful.

01:07:07.391 --> 01:07:09.459
I have to get around in that.

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:15.332
You can afford
a hundred of them now.

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:16.666
Oh, great.

01:07:16.766 --> 01:07:18.835
I'd settle for one that works.

01:07:20.237 --> 01:07:22.606
So that's it?

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:24.240
The almighty Godsend.

01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:25.609
When you're emperor,

01:07:25.709 --> 01:07:30.314
maybe start by naming it
something less confusing.

01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:45.128
Once that passageway opens up,

01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:48.765
he contacts the Terrans,
they come through.

01:07:50.467 --> 01:07:52.301
They're detonating it here.

01:07:52.302 --> 01:07:55.172
And he'd be
the darling of the Empire.

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:58.074
So he throws the Federation
into chaos...

01:07:58.175 --> 01:08:00.177
Starfleet will start scrambling.

01:08:00.277 --> 01:08:01.978
Perfect time to invade.

01:08:04.681 --> 01:08:06.550
You gave birth to this thing.

01:08:08.385 --> 01:08:10.687
- How do we stop it?
-We don't.

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.190
We're trapped here,
so we can't follow him.

01:08:13.290 --> 01:08:15.525
The antenna's destroyed,
so we can't warn anybody.

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:17.026
That is bullshit.

01:08:18.228 --> 01:08:20.029
- You can do better than that.
- I can't.

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:21.331
The Godsend is me.

01:08:21.431 --> 01:08:24.634
I'm the only one
I could never defeat.

01:08:26.370 --> 01:08:29.373
The past always
catches up with you.

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:30.740
Right?

01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:37.747
Doesn't mean it always wins.

01:08:39.683 --> 01:08:41.885
Every safe house,
I have a backup plan.

01:08:41.985 --> 01:08:43.520
We'll get that scow running.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:46.856
Boss, the scow won't fly.

01:08:46.956 --> 01:08:48.725
Not without an asymptote coil.

01:08:50.427 --> 01:08:52.196
We have one.

01:08:52.296 --> 01:08:54.097
We'll catch up with San.

01:08:54.198 --> 01:08:56.533
We'll make sure
he can't contact the Terrans.

01:08:56.633 --> 01:08:58.067
You ripped out the coil.

01:08:58.202 --> 01:09:00.570
Couldn't tell you while
a mole was still running around.

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:05.409
Asshole.

01:09:18.021 --> 01:09:20.457
Okay, Quas, give her a rip.

01:09:26.463 --> 01:09:27.664
Still just one pulse.

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:34.438
And we're in business.

01:09:34.538 --> 01:09:37.574
Okay, team, we have
less than 30 minutes.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:39.208
Quas, set a course
for the Crescent Nebula.

01:09:39.209 --> 01:09:42.412
All right, this is gonna be
bumpy and bad.

01:09:42.512 --> 01:09:44.348
I'm assuming
San's ship will be armed.

01:09:44.448 --> 01:09:47.150
Yeah, every Terran ship's armed.

01:09:47.284 --> 01:09:49.553
He'll have
proton cannons, torpedoes,

01:09:49.653 --> 01:09:52.656
and we are a garbage barge.

01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:54.224
Why are you laughing?

01:09:54.324 --> 01:09:56.260
Because I can't imagine
things getting much worse.

01:10:02.098 --> 01:10:03.399
Let's go.

01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:16.078
So, this thing flies around in
the middle of a tractor field.

01:10:16.079 --> 01:10:17.981
People jettison their garbage
into space,

01:10:18.081 --> 01:10:19.916
and the scow flies around
and drags the trash

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:21.150
along with the field.

01:10:22.319 --> 01:10:24.120
Once the tractor field is full,

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:25.855
it dumps the trash in the Nebula

01:10:25.989 --> 01:10:27.691
where it disintegrates
in the radiation.

01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:29.626
I just want to be clear.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:31.495
You're saying that
our best potential weapon is

01:10:31.595 --> 01:10:33.330
a beam for collecting garbage?

01:10:33.463 --> 01:10:34.698
- Yes.
- Great.

01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:37.567
Hey, being judgy
never helped anything.

01:10:39.469 --> 01:10:41.338
- Where are you going?
- Engineering.

01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:42.872
If that's our only weapon,

01:10:42.972 --> 01:10:44.908
I'll redirect all power
to the tractor beams.

01:10:45.008 --> 01:10:47.010
That's actually a good plan.

01:11:07.831 --> 01:11:09.399
We're in position.

01:11:09.499 --> 01:11:11.467
The passageway will open soon.

01:11:11.468 --> 01:11:14.303
Do you know what I want
when this is all over?

01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:16.673
Just a big space, you know,

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:19.476
for me hatchlings to tunnel
and fly around and...

01:11:19.576 --> 01:11:21.545
What do you want?

01:11:21.645 --> 01:11:25.514
I want Philippa Georgiou
to marinate in her own defeat.

01:11:25.515 --> 01:11:28.718
I get you guys are all
"eternal nemesis,

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:30.554
sexy evil tension"
and stuff, but...

01:11:30.654 --> 01:11:31.988
<i>Alert.</i>

01:11:32.088 --> 01:11:33.390
<i>Incoming vessel.</i>

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:36.325
<i>Collision trajectory detected.</i>

01:11:36.326 --> 01:11:38.595
Of course she got it
off the ground.

01:11:40.530 --> 01:11:42.998
I say we should use
the torpedoes.

01:11:46.336 --> 01:11:48.237
<i>
They've picked us up.</i>

01:11:48.338 --> 01:11:50.205
<i>
Photon torpedo incoming.</i>

01:11:50.206 --> 01:11:52.541
- Impact in five, four...
- Really want to take
evasive action right now!

01:11:52.542 --> 01:11:56.079
- ...three, two, one.
- Quas, hold the course.
Put everything in our shields.

01:12:01.685 --> 01:12:03.387
Why isn't she changing course?

01:12:03.487 --> 01:12:05.020
Do I look like a fortune teller?

01:12:07.023 --> 01:12:10.159
Do we have enough juice to drag
them with the tractor beam yet?

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:11.961
Yeah, but we can't take
another direct hit.

01:12:12.095 --> 01:12:14.798
Incoming torpedo
in five, four...

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:18.101
- Keep it steady.
We're almost there...
- ...three, two, one.

01:12:18.201 --> 01:12:19.836
Now.

01:12:29.312 --> 01:12:32.382
<i>
Alert.
Navigation control suspended.</i>

01:12:32.482 --> 01:12:35.118
What are they gonna do,
drag us to death?

01:12:36.753 --> 01:12:39.623
She's trying to stop me
from reaching the Empire.

01:12:39.723 --> 01:12:41.157
Oh.

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:46.162
How's everybody feeling
about this?

01:12:46.295 --> 01:12:47.397
It's the only way.

01:12:47.497 --> 01:12:48.632
This can work.

01:12:48.765 --> 01:12:50.500
The radiation will
wear down their shields.

01:12:50.634 --> 01:12:53.537
Yeah, the thing is,
the radiation hits us, too.

01:12:55.271 --> 01:12:58.241
<i>
Target lock malfunction.</i>

01:12:58.341 --> 01:13:00.977
I can't get torpedo lock.
Cannons offline.

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:02.479
San?

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:05.748
San.

01:13:05.749 --> 01:13:07.517
San!

01:13:15.258 --> 01:13:17.994
<i>
Radiation levels critical.</i>

01:13:18.127 --> 01:13:21.197
Shields are down.
I repeat, shields are down!

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:25.869
And San's?

01:13:26.002 --> 01:13:27.671
His are at 12% and falling fast.

01:13:27.771 --> 01:13:28.972
Plasma incoming!

01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:30.439
We get caught
with a burst like that,

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:31.675
and we're done.

01:13:31.808 --> 01:13:34.010
This is chaos, Garrett.

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:35.512
You know you love it, hmm?

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:39.382
Maybe let it in,
make out with it a little.

01:13:39.516 --> 01:13:41.450
It's why Starfleet put you here.

01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:43.286
Chaos is my friend
with benefits.

01:13:43.386 --> 01:13:45.522
Yeah, Garrett, let's get messy.

01:13:45.622 --> 01:13:47.491
- Hmm?
- Okay.

01:13:47.591 --> 01:13:49.225
- You got this, Quas.
- Uh-huh.

01:13:49.358 --> 01:13:50.527
You ready?

01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:52.061
San's shields are
at four percent.

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.865
Two now.

01:13:55.965 --> 01:13:57.734
His shields are down.

01:13:57.867 --> 01:13:59.202
Good to go.

01:14:37.507 --> 01:14:38.775
Philippa!

01:14:43.913 --> 01:14:46.750
This contest only ends

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:50.053
when one of us is dead!

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:59.194
<i>
Detonation sequence activating.</i>

01:15:00.764 --> 01:15:02.566
See, the Nanokins,
we don't need the Federation.

01:15:02.666 --> 01:15:03.899
We never have.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:07.436
We ruled before
you behemoths found us,

01:15:07.537 --> 01:15:10.306
and we will rule again
after you're gone.

01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:20.449
Guess who survives
very large explosions.

01:15:22.218 --> 01:15:24.954
Very small things.

01:15:25.088 --> 01:15:28.057
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I need to cut our ship loose.

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:30.259
Sorry if your friends die
in the process.

01:15:30.359 --> 01:15:32.094
No, I'm joking.

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:33.496
I can't wait to kill them.

01:15:33.597 --> 01:15:36.399
So long, you big lumps of shite!

01:15:52.649 --> 01:15:54.183
Who's flying that?

01:15:54.317 --> 01:15:58.054
Uh, according to the sensors,
one tiny life-form on board,

01:15:58.154 --> 01:15:59.856
and it's heading right for us.

01:16:02.926 --> 01:16:04.460
Plot missile lock.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:07.263
We have trash, all right?
Just trash.

01:16:26.783 --> 01:16:27.851
But one.

01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:29.052
<i>
San.</i>

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:39.929
<i>
Awaiting
biosignature confirmation.</i>

01:16:41.364 --> 01:16:42.598
I've got Fuzz's shuttle.

01:16:42.699 --> 01:16:44.067
He's heading back to San's ship.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.502
- We're barely keeping up.
- Stay on him.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.271
Uh, we don't have any weapons.

01:16:48.371 --> 01:16:49.873
We have a payload bay
full of trash.

01:16:49.973 --> 01:16:51.207
Do not lose that shuttle.

01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:52.676
Okay.

01:16:58.715 --> 01:17:00.182
I was nothing!

01:17:00.183 --> 01:17:03.018
That boy was soft, weak.

01:17:03.019 --> 01:17:07.090
But all those years under your
heel taught me who I am now.

01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:10.093
The Empire's
coming through that portal.

01:17:10.226 --> 01:17:11.294
My Empire!

01:17:11.394 --> 01:17:13.495
And we will reign
over this universe

01:17:13.496 --> 01:17:17.266
with righteous mercy,
not like you!

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:22.939
There are
no benevolent dictators, San.

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:30.513
You taught me that.

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:33.817
We can come back from this.

01:17:37.687 --> 01:17:39.655
We can start over.

01:17:54.938 --> 01:17:56.639
Oh, I love chaos.

01:17:56.773 --> 01:17:58.274
Chaos is my jam.

01:17:58.374 --> 01:18:00.376
I love chaos. I love chaos.

01:18:00.476 --> 01:18:02.979
<i>Garrett, what the hell
are you doing down there?</i>

01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:04.747
Quasi, I am a trained
Starfleet officer

01:18:04.748 --> 01:18:06.950
who fully intends on living long
enough to be captain one day.

01:18:07.083 --> 01:18:08.617
You got to trust me, okay?

01:18:08.752 --> 01:18:10.954
Hi there.

01:18:11.054 --> 01:18:12.655
<i>I'm so glad you found me.</i>

01:18:12.756 --> 01:18:14.023
What'd you just say?

01:18:14.891 --> 01:18:16.960
Uh... uh...

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:18.261
It's a toy.

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:20.129
Looks like it came from
a Droom planet.

01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:22.597
Shall we do something fun
together?

01:18:22.598 --> 01:18:24.667
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:18:25.468 --> 01:18:26.770
You okay down there, Starfleet?

01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:28.937
Whoa.

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:32.742
Oh, come on, come on,
come on, come on. Yes.

01:18:32.842 --> 01:18:35.812
Oh, we do not let Droom tech
into the Federation

01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:38.581
because they use Terrenium
as a power source.

01:18:39.348 --> 01:18:40.783
Oh, you're gonna blow us up,
aren't you?

01:18:40.784 --> 01:18:43.052
You better hope
that this ship's hull

01:18:43.152 --> 01:18:45.021
is reinforced with Tomohite.

01:19:09.946 --> 01:19:13.249
I am a science officer.

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:15.985
And science is
just controlled chaos.

01:19:16.085 --> 01:19:18.654
Whoa, chaos, chaos,
chaos, chaos, chaos!

01:19:30.666 --> 01:19:32.401
Ah, come on.

01:19:32.535 --> 01:19:34.904
Get up, you stupid robot.

01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:58.226
No. No.

01:19:58.227 --> 01:19:59.695
No!

01:20:03.799 --> 01:20:06.602
Stay in front of Fuzz's ship
so we can open the payload bay.

01:20:06.702 --> 01:20:08.571
Uh, yeah.

01:20:08.671 --> 01:20:10.406
About that.

01:20:10.506 --> 01:20:13.041
- Uh, thing is...
- Quasi, there's about to be
a very large explosion.

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:15.111
This console's
in a language I don't know.

01:20:15.244 --> 01:20:16.545
I can decipher some of it.

01:20:16.645 --> 01:20:17.947
I just have to
break it down to morphemes

01:20:18.081 --> 01:20:19.615
- and, you know...
- Large explosion impending.

01:20:19.748 --> 01:20:22.285
Either of these two buttons
could open the cargo bay.

01:20:22.385 --> 01:20:23.586
Okay, so push them both.

01:20:23.686 --> 01:20:24.820
Either of these two buttons
could also

01:20:24.954 --> 01:20:26.155
initiate
a self-destruct protocol.

01:20:26.255 --> 01:20:28.423
- We're gonna blow up anyway.
- Uh-huh.

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:30.826
- Um, uh.. Huh?
- Quasi. Quasi, look at me.

01:20:30.927 --> 01:20:32.628
You just need to make a call.

01:20:32.728 --> 01:20:34.096
You know what to do.

01:20:34.097 --> 01:20:35.731
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:48.377
Uh...

01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:51.814
We can be friends forever...

01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:37.026
Do you want to hear
something funny?

01:21:37.126 --> 01:21:38.961
I'm on autopilot.

01:21:47.370 --> 01:21:49.038
What the hell?

01:21:49.138 --> 01:21:51.907
We're all gonna die.

01:21:52.041 --> 01:21:54.643
We're all gonna die.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.048
No!

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:02.885
It's wonderful
just to be with you.

01:22:07.423 --> 01:22:08.490
- Whoo!
- Whoa!

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:10.726
Yes!

01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:38.821
Die now.

01:22:38.921 --> 01:22:43.059
Go tell your family
how much you've changed.

01:22:57.973 --> 01:22:59.675
San.

01:22:59.775 --> 01:23:02.311
No. No.

01:23:02.445 --> 01:23:04.513
No.

01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:07.150
San.

01:23:10.586 --> 01:23:12.455
San.

01:23:12.555 --> 01:23:14.857
This is not what I want.

01:23:14.957 --> 01:23:16.159
Please.

01:23:16.259 --> 01:23:19.962
-  I love you.
-  I love you.

01:23:21.564 --> 01:23:22.798
<i>
San.</i>

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:24.200
San.

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:26.235
I'm sorry.

01:23:27.170 --> 01:23:28.603
I'm so sorry.

01:23:28.604 --> 01:23:31.507
You-you-you were right.

01:23:36.479 --> 01:23:38.913
I still needed you.

01:23:38.914 --> 01:23:41.250
I always needed...

01:23:43.219 --> 01:23:46.655
To show me who I am, even now.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:51.560
Now.

01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:55.564
M-M... My emperor.

01:23:58.201 --> 01:24:00.103
My love.

01:24:02.771 --> 01:24:04.307
No.

01:24:06.275 --> 01:24:08.844
We are one.

01:24:10.146 --> 01:24:12.014
Forever.

01:24:18.954 --> 01:24:22.458
<i>
Ion storm convergence imminent.</i>

01:24:33.269 --> 01:24:35.638
<i>Passageway is opening.</i>

<i>
Target lock confirmed.</i>

01:25:10.806 --> 01:25:13.442
If you could go back,

01:25:13.576 --> 01:25:15.278
and you were kneeling
in front of Giri,

01:25:15.378 --> 01:25:17.112
would you kill her?

01:25:17.246 --> 01:25:21.116
Would you put a stop to all
the suffering and smoke forever,

01:25:21.217 --> 01:25:24.787
even if it meant
that you had to die?

01:25:31.727 --> 01:25:33.296
Yes.

01:25:35.498 --> 01:25:38.301
Then I'm glad I knew you,
Alok Sahar.

01:25:58.587 --> 01:25:59.855
What?

01:25:59.955 --> 01:26:01.490
- Yeah.
- You need to
transport them back.

01:26:01.590 --> 01:26:02.725
- Yeah. Okay.
-Now.

01:26:02.825 --> 01:26:04.460
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

01:26:05.561 --> 01:26:08.697

Come on. Come on!

They're running out of time.

01:26:26.282 --> 01:26:27.750
I'm trying.

GEORGIOU
Lieutenant Garrett?

01:26:54.443 --> 01:26:56.779
Rachel?

01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:08.424
You all right?

01:27:08.524 --> 01:27:09.692
- I'm okay.
- Hmm? You here?

01:27:09.792 --> 01:27:11.226
- Yeah. You're alive.
- All right.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.994
Yeah, Quasi got us out.

01:27:12.995 --> 01:27:14.630
- There we go. There we are.
-Thank you.

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:16.031
Oh, you did it.

01:27:16.131 --> 01:27:17.933
Oh, we won.

01:27:18.033 --> 01:27:20.167
Oh. Grow up.

01:27:20.168 --> 01:27:23.906
Perkiness is disgusting.

01:27:24.807 --> 01:27:26.074
Yeah.

01:27:26.942 --> 01:27:29.010
I hear you.

01:27:29.011 --> 01:27:31.979
It's happening.

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.483
The passageway's collapsing.

01:28:42.485 --> 01:28:44.786
There she is.

01:28:44.787 --> 01:28:46.454
How was your debrief?

01:28:46.455 --> 01:28:48.190
Oh, could've been worse.

01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:49.992
They made me an offer.

01:28:50.092 --> 01:28:51.660
And?

01:28:51.794 --> 01:28:53.762
I'm sitting on it.

01:28:53.862 --> 01:28:54.830
You?

01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:56.665
Meh. Hmm.

01:28:59.201 --> 01:29:00.436
Hmm.

01:29:00.536 --> 01:29:02.170
And how long did you think

01:29:02.270 --> 01:29:04.907
you could fool me
with this, hmm?

01:29:06.274 --> 01:29:08.176
- What gave it away?
- Mm.

01:29:08.977 --> 01:29:12.180
You still get nervous
when I look at you.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:13.682
Oh. Hey, C-Cap.

01:29:13.782 --> 01:29:15.183
Leave that poor man alone.

01:29:15.283 --> 01:29:16.685
Virgil.

01:29:16.785 --> 01:29:18.687
A round of elixirs
for my friends.

01:29:18.821 --> 01:29:20.689
- Pleasure, Madame du Franc.
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:20.789 --> 01:29:23.358
Lieutenant Garrett.

01:29:23.459 --> 01:29:24.693
They let you off the ship.

01:29:24.827 --> 01:29:27.396
It's actually Lieutenant
Commander Garrett now.

01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:28.964
- Oh.
- Thank you very much.

01:29:29.064 --> 01:29:31.500
And if this unit is
gonna be a permanent detail,

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:33.502
then you all
definitely need oversight.

01:29:33.602 --> 01:29:37.372
I may slaughter you all
at any moment.

01:29:37.473 --> 01:29:40.242
Is that a deal-breaker?

01:29:40.342 --> 01:29:42.077
- Nah.
- Whatevs.

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:43.511
It's not like
you need a reason anyway.

01:29:43.512 --> 01:29:45.414
It's true. You're a bad bitch.

01:29:45.548 --> 01:29:47.750
- With the stare of death.
-Oh, we get it.

01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:49.651
You're a terrifying,
soulless murderer

01:29:49.652 --> 01:29:51.520
who we can never truly trust.

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:53.255
I love that for us.

01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:55.658
Somebody's got to
keep things lively.

01:29:55.758 --> 01:29:57.926
-Touché.
-Yes, touché.
- You make a point.

01:29:59.194 --> 01:30:01.028
To us.

01:30:01.029 --> 01:30:02.565
To us.

01:30:04.166 --> 01:30:05.568
This isn't poison, is it?

01:30:05.668 --> 01:30:09.237
And now that
you have us all here,

01:30:09.337 --> 01:30:10.238
what next?

01:30:10.338 --> 01:30:11.406
Well, not quite all.

01:30:11.507 --> 01:30:14.376
Ladies and gent, stage left.

01:30:18.581 --> 01:30:19.982
You got to be kidding me.

01:30:20.082 --> 01:30:21.849
Oh, I'm not Fuzz.

01:30:21.850 --> 01:30:24.086
Section 31 bought

01:30:24.186 --> 01:30:27.255
two of these conveyances
on the black market.

01:30:27.389 --> 01:30:29.857
Name's Wisp. I'm his wife.

01:30:29.858 --> 01:30:31.594
And I'm here for
when we catch up with

01:30:31.694 --> 01:30:33.762
that lying, double-dealing
son of a bitch.

01:30:33.896 --> 01:30:36.397
Uh, well, we blew up
his ship, ma'am.

01:30:36.398 --> 01:30:38.634
- Uh, Mrs. Fuzz.
-  Oh, honey.

01:30:38.767 --> 01:30:42.137
Little things sometimes survive
big explosions.

01:30:42.270 --> 01:30:45.107
And when we find him,
I have questions.

01:30:45.207 --> 01:30:48.110
- Now, what are we talking about?
-I'm glad you asked.

01:30:48.210 --> 01:30:50.078
I was just letting
the team know.

01:30:50.178 --> 01:30:52.781
Control has a job for us.

01:31:05.894 --> 01:31:07.462
My better judgment has been

01:31:07.563 --> 01:31:09.031
screaming at me
for two days now.

01:31:09.131 --> 01:31:14.401
It keeps saying that you lot
are gonna cost me my job.

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:16.204
- We might.
- She might.

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:18.405
I told my judgment to shut up

01:31:18.406 --> 01:31:20.475
and take a nap.

01:31:21.276 --> 01:31:23.111
'Cause we have work to do.

01:31:24.279 --> 01:31:27.683
Has anybody been to Turkana IV?

01:31:29.417 --> 01:31:30.753
- Whew.
-Wait.

01:31:30.853 --> 01:31:32.655
Did you say Turkana
or say Jur-Jurnana?

01:31:32.788 --> 01:31:34.322
He thought "Your Mama IV."

01:31:34.422 --> 01:31:36.591
Oh, Your Mama IV.

01:31:36.592 --> 01:31:39.528
No.
