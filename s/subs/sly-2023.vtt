WEBVTT

00:06.464 --> 00:09.884
[birds singing]

00:15.348 --> 00:17.851
[Sly] Do I have regrets?
Hell yeah, I have regrets.

00:17.934 --> 00:20.854
But that also is what

00:22.397 --> 00:24.357
motivates me to overcome the regrets.

00:24.441 --> 00:25.775
-[claps]
-To, like, fix it.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.903
And I do that through painting,
or I do that through writing.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.697
'Cause I can't fix it physically.

00:30.780 --> 00:31.614
It's gone.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.409
You know, that fucking thing called time.

00:34.492 --> 00:35.785
Just… [whooshes]

00:35.869 --> 00:39.539
Gone. You know, I look at…
Like, of you're ever on a train,

00:39.622 --> 00:42.917
in every window… [whooshing]
…scenery is going by.

00:43.001 --> 00:44.627
It's like a photo. Wham, wham, wham.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.379
And you're never coming that way again.

00:46.463 --> 00:48.006
And that's what your life is. Whoosh!

00:48.089 --> 00:51.134
Snapping images seen whipping by.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.469
And you can't… It's gone.

00:52.552 --> 00:57.223
[feedback-heavy electric guitar plays]

01:19.621 --> 01:24.334
["To Hell With Poverty"
by Gang of Four playing]

02:19.222 --> 02:20.473
[song fades out]

02:23.852 --> 02:25.854
[faint birdsong]

02:33.444 --> 02:36.030
[Sly] It's really easy
to become complacent.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.201
I thought, "I gotta do something drastic."

02:40.285 --> 02:42.912
Everything is getting
kind of mundane, repetitive.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.332
I can feel myself
withering a little bit, drying up,

02:46.416 --> 02:49.460
like an old fig that fell off a tree.
You know, you're drying up.

02:49.544 --> 02:52.172
Jesus, what am I gonna be around for?
Another 20 years?

02:52.255 --> 02:53.923
I don't wanna be complacent for 20 years.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.552
So I said, "Well, you really
want to get the adrenals going?"

02:58.052 --> 02:58.970
"Leave."

02:59.804 --> 03:02.307
And that's why I gotta move east.

03:03.516 --> 03:08.646
Nothing, I think, inspires you
than taking your house or your history,

03:09.522 --> 03:10.899
balling it up. You know…

03:10.982 --> 03:12.150
[whooshes]

03:16.738 --> 03:18.990
Who is this man, Sylvester Stallone?

03:19.073 --> 03:21.284
Artist, writer, poet, performer,

03:21.367 --> 03:22.994
enormous celebrity.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.121
How does that happen?

03:25.747 --> 03:28.499
Sly is a guy who always
will go down his own path.

03:28.583 --> 03:31.878
And if that path doesn't exist,
he'll run the road himself.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.380
He was a self-creator.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.884
[man 1] Ostensibly, he didn't
appear to be a great actor.

03:37.967 --> 03:40.511
He didn't have obvious charisma.

03:40.595 --> 03:42.597
But he invented something else.

03:43.181 --> 03:46.726
An actor who writes and directs himself.

03:46.809 --> 03:52.565
He's not the first person to do it,
but he was the first superstar to do it.

03:52.649 --> 03:57.737
He really understood
what people wanted to see him do.

03:57.820 --> 04:00.490
I was invested in the Stallone story

04:00.573 --> 04:02.533
as if it were my story.

04:02.617 --> 04:06.913
It was my daydream of…
of what could happen in a career.

04:06.996 --> 04:12.043
There is no one that has
stepped into three franchises.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.254
The genius behind that.

04:16.047 --> 04:18.091
This was not an accident.

04:21.844 --> 04:25.265
[producer] Can you show me some of those
cassettes that you found while packing up?

04:25.348 --> 04:26.432
Yeah, I got some.

04:27.725 --> 04:28.810
Let's see.

04:29.686 --> 04:31.646
This is New York Times.

04:34.732 --> 04:35.775
[tape player thunks]

04:39.570 --> 04:41.406
[woman] Could you do me a favor?

04:41.489 --> 04:43.866
I start off by quoting
from your press release,

04:43.950 --> 04:47.078
and then you pick up the story
where I leave off. Right? Okay.

04:47.161 --> 04:51.332
"Sylvester Stallone was born in the tough
Hell's Kitchen section of New York

04:51.416 --> 04:54.168
in the sweltering summer of 1946."

04:54.252 --> 04:55.753
[car horns honking]

04:55.837 --> 04:59.465
[soft instrumental music playing]

05:02.135 --> 05:03.344
[Sly] Holy shit.

05:05.013 --> 05:09.809
I never, ever, ever thought
I would come back here.

05:10.435 --> 05:14.022
I was born in Hell's Kitchen.
I was New York.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.401
I haven't been here in 65 years.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.029
You guys livin' here?

05:21.112 --> 05:22.780
[man] No, I'm 45th.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.240
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

05:25.116 --> 05:27.577
-I used to live here.
-You lived in this block here?

05:27.660 --> 05:30.413
-Yeah, absolutely.
-What was the neighborhood like then?

05:30.496 --> 05:31.622
-It was rough.
-Yeah?

05:31.706 --> 05:34.250
Well, it was really
Hell's Kitchen back then. Yeah.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.628
I remember, the window was always open.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.882
[chuckles] So you learn a lot
about human nature,

05:40.965 --> 05:43.092
and you're observing life.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.552
You're watching a movie.

05:44.635 --> 05:47.305
"Hey, when you coming over?"
"I'm coming over tomorrow."

05:47.388 --> 05:48.681
"Shut your friggin' window."

05:48.765 --> 05:50.641
It's back and forth.

05:53.436 --> 05:57.190
I remember my father, like,
always wearing, like, an Italian T-shirt,

05:57.273 --> 06:01.652
and, like, just… it looked like
something out of an Arthur Miller play.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.489
View from the Bridge, it was…
That's my life.

06:06.407 --> 06:09.243
My father came to New York.
That's where he met my mother.

06:09.327 --> 06:12.288
He's a barber
transitioning into "cosmetology"

06:12.372 --> 06:14.832
'cause there was
more money as a hairdresser.

06:14.916 --> 06:19.837
Our father was also very self-conscious
because I don't think he was educated.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.924
Any kind of slight or insult would, like…

06:23.007 --> 06:24.008
He'd go off.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.802
Our mother was pretty bad too.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.472
She was pretty handy with
the old hairbrush and the shower brush.

06:29.555 --> 06:32.809
She had long nails that'd never break.
She'd go, "Come here, you!"

06:33.851 --> 06:38.648
My mother was a cigarette girl
at Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.235
That's primarily where
the money was coming from.

06:43.319 --> 06:49.325
My father told me that…
she just was afraid to have a kid.

06:50.076 --> 06:54.789
Even though she was nine months pregnant,
she kept riding around on the bus.

06:54.872 --> 06:57.041
And she'd gone into labor.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.669
Somebody smart enough
to get her off the bus,

06:59.752 --> 07:01.963
they carry her into a charity ward.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.259
And that's where I was
brought into the world,

07:06.342 --> 07:07.552
via this accident,

07:07.635 --> 07:11.764
which kind of paralyzed
all the nerves on the side of my mouth.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.641
So I was born with this snarl.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.476
[soft music playing]

07:18.438 --> 07:20.940
[Sly] She was quite eccentric, colorful,

07:21.023 --> 07:25.027
very, very, very outspoken
and unpredictable.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.573
I know I've got a certain kind of…

07:32.326 --> 07:35.371
ferocity from my father, no question.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.209
Our mother and father,
it was like clockwork.

07:40.293 --> 07:44.630
I'd be up in bed, and you'd just
hear them screaming and yelling.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.591
My father… [snarling]

07:46.674 --> 07:51.137
And I was petrified… 'cause, I mean,
I could just feel the reverberation.

07:54.348 --> 07:58.561
I think they both were so self-absorbed
with their own stuff, my parents,

07:58.644 --> 08:00.229
that they just pawned us off.

08:00.313 --> 08:04.692
The majority of the time
I was living in a boarding house.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.694
Basically 12 months a year,

08:06.777 --> 08:09.322
never went home,
'cause they just didn't have time.

08:09.405 --> 08:10.781
They were both working.

08:10.865 --> 08:15.995
And people say, "Oh, you feel deprived
and you weren't nurtured."

08:16.078 --> 08:17.747
I thought, "Yeah, that's true."

08:18.789 --> 08:23.085
And maybe the nurturing comes from

08:23.169 --> 08:25.213
the respect and love of strangers.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.840
To feel embraced and loved

08:28.466 --> 08:30.468
by an audience,

08:30.551 --> 08:32.011
it's insatiable.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.599
I wish I could get over it,
but… you can't.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.816
[Frank] I think movies for me and him
were total, absolutely escapism.

08:45.900 --> 08:47.276
[projector whirring]

08:48.611 --> 08:52.240
I would spend untold hours in theaters,
and I don't care what it was,

08:52.323 --> 08:54.784
I'd sit there
and watch this thing five, six times

08:54.867 --> 08:57.620
and then go home at four in the afternoon.

08:58.955 --> 09:02.583
That's the life I wanted to lead.
That's the ideals. Grandeur.

09:02.667 --> 09:06.796
That's hard work, and triumphs over evil.

09:08.464 --> 09:09.966
I always had hero worship.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.760
I wish I could be the guy
who saved the bus full of children.

09:12.843 --> 09:17.431
That's who I want to be.
I want to be the guy who

09:18.474 --> 09:19.559
saves people.

09:24.021 --> 09:26.691
I would stay alone in my parents' room,

09:26.774 --> 09:31.195
and they had a cheap Woolworth's
three-dollar, $2.99 mirror.

09:31.988 --> 09:35.241
I would sit there
and do things all day in the mirror,

09:35.324 --> 09:37.034
whether it be imitation…

09:37.118 --> 09:39.704
While someone is singing, I'm lip-syncing.

09:39.787 --> 09:41.872
Or go see a movie like Hercules,

09:41.956 --> 09:44.917
and I'd come back
and try to imitate Steve Reeves.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.670
[epic "Hercules" score playing]

09:49.755 --> 09:52.883
[Sly] The moment in Hercules Unchained,
when he steps up,

09:52.967 --> 09:55.011
and he pulls the temples down,

09:55.094 --> 09:58.681
and this… ridiculously handsome,

09:58.764 --> 10:02.727
well-built, perfect male role model…

10:02.810 --> 10:03.894
That did it.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.814
I go, "There it is. That's the road."

10:06.897 --> 10:10.318
'Cause I finally had
a role model that I idolized.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.696
-And my destiny to fulfill!
-[loud thunderclap]

10:13.779 --> 10:17.283
My father realized
he's not going to make it in New York,

10:17.366 --> 10:19.827
so they took off to Maryland.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.040
[Frank] We came from broken marriage.

10:24.123 --> 10:27.001
I mean, I came home from school
and no one was home.

10:27.084 --> 10:28.711
My mother had taken off.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.922
They went to court. It was terrible.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.550
I went with my mother in Philadelphia,

10:34.634 --> 10:37.094
and my brother stayed
with my father in Maryland.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.556
Complete country and crickets,
pretty isolated,

10:41.223 --> 10:43.184
and there were only horses.

10:43.267 --> 10:46.020
[tense electric guitar music builds]

10:54.403 --> 10:57.239
I've been… For some reason,
I had an affinity with horses

10:57.323 --> 10:59.158
since I was five or six years old.

10:59.241 --> 11:02.078
Not good horses,
just horses my father would buy.

11:02.161 --> 11:03.913
Twenty dollars, $25.

11:03.996 --> 11:09.335
He didn't have much money, but somehow
he got involved with a polo team.

11:11.379 --> 11:15.549
And everyone in polo had
beautiful horses, great trailers, ranches.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.635
We had a… [chuckles] …a dump.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.262
The horses, most of 'em
had medical problems.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.973
Some of 'em, if you pulled up
too quickly, they'd go blind.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.060
So I started playing polo,

11:26.143 --> 11:28.813
but sandlot kind of polo, like, low level.

11:28.896 --> 11:32.441
But I learned. Anyway, I started
getting better and better and better.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.569
And then when I was 13,
I was starting to get ranked.

11:35.653 --> 11:37.196
I'm gonna get nationally ranked.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.323
My father

11:40.241 --> 11:41.742
wasn't liking that so much.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.161
And in the middle of a game,

11:44.245 --> 11:46.080
I was going for a nearside backhand,

11:46.789 --> 11:49.625
and I didn't do anything wrong,

11:49.709 --> 11:52.169
he goes,
"You're pulling too hard on the horse!"

11:52.253 --> 11:54.588
I said, "I know what I'm doing."
He goes, "You don't!"

11:54.672 --> 11:57.258
"You don't know what you're riding."
Screaming from the stands.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.886
And finally I pulled the horse up
to get ready for another throw,

12:00.970 --> 12:03.013
and he comes out of the stands,

12:03.097 --> 12:06.225
grabs me by the throat,
throws me on the ground,

12:07.476 --> 12:09.979
takes the horse, and walks off the field.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.857
And I laid there and I went,

12:12.940 --> 12:15.484
"I never want to see
a horse again in my whole life."

12:19.947 --> 12:21.991
I was raised by a very…

12:23.367 --> 12:25.703
physical father. You know? I mean…

12:27.246 --> 12:30.332
So I was no stranger to serious pain.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.044
And I think it just became,
"I'm not gonna break."

12:34.128 --> 12:37.965
No matter what he did, you know?
I'm just not going to break.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.926
[Frank] I think my father was jealous.

12:41.010 --> 12:43.262
My brother, he was a problem guy.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.055
He was truant. He'd get in fights.

12:45.139 --> 12:48.726
He wasn't a good student,
and he got thrown out of all his schools.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.855
[Sly] I went to 13 schools in 12 years.

12:52.938 --> 12:56.108
They put me in a military school.
I don't think I was there for a month.

12:56.192 --> 12:59.028
[Frank] Well, he was kind of incorrigible.
He got in a lot of trouble.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.404
He went to Devereux School,

13:00.488 --> 13:03.574
which was kind of a school
for wayward kids, I guess.

13:03.657 --> 13:08.078
And that's where he kind of
started getting the little bug for acting.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.580
And then he went to college.

13:09.663 --> 13:12.374
That's when he got serious
about the acting stuff.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.044
There was an opportunity to audition…

13:15.628 --> 13:18.088
I don't even know why, but I did.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.590
…for Death of a Salesman.

13:19.673 --> 13:21.342
And I got it.

13:21.425 --> 13:24.470
[Sly on tape]
I was on stage and I was feeling…

13:24.553 --> 13:26.180
I wasn't feeling nervous at all.

13:26.263 --> 13:30.059
I felt in control of the situation
because this comes naturally,

13:30.142 --> 13:32.394
this comes easily to me.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.898
There was a Harvard professor
in the audience who came up and said,

13:36.565 --> 13:40.069
"You should think of this as… a career."

13:40.152 --> 13:42.279
I go, "Come on." He goes, "Yeah."

13:42.822 --> 13:46.700
"You should really study this.
You have something."

13:46.784 --> 13:48.911
And that moment

13:49.912 --> 13:51.789
changed the course of my life.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.583
[gentle instrumental music plays]

13:59.630 --> 14:03.717
[Sly on tape] And I landed in New York
the day of Woodstock.

14:03.801 --> 14:08.222
I said, "It's about time
for me to apply myself."

14:10.224 --> 14:13.310
[energetic guitar music playing]

14:13.394 --> 14:16.897
I didn't even know what kind of city
I was living in. I wasn't part of it.

14:18.315 --> 14:22.862
Very much alone and very dedicated
to trying to find my way.

14:23.946 --> 14:27.491
I've hustled on these streets.
I know how to survive on these streets.

14:27.575 --> 14:32.371
I've slept in doorways and bus stops
and train stations and libraries.

14:32.454 --> 14:34.915
I mean, freezing cold, I get it.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.627
I would go to agencies.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.131
I go to every one of these places.
"I'd like to be a client."

14:42.214 --> 14:43.924
"We're not accepting anything."

14:44.008 --> 14:46.844
I'd push the picture in,
and they'd push it out. [chuckles]

14:47.428 --> 14:50.055
I tried out and they'd say,
"No, you slur."

14:50.139 --> 14:52.391
"Your eyes droop.
You're this, you're that."

14:53.058 --> 14:55.811
The best I would get
would be off-off Broadway

14:55.895 --> 14:57.771
where you had to be half-naked.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.816
That's the only kind of crap
I was getting. It was terrible.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.570
They said, "It's just not gonna work.
Maybe you'll be an extra."

15:04.653 --> 15:07.990
So I started to buy into that,
I'd go, "Hmm."

15:08.073 --> 15:10.284
Because every time I was cast,

15:10.367 --> 15:11.952
it was always for a thug.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.246
-Watch it, will ya?
-Sorry, man, I didn't see ya!

15:14.330 --> 15:16.040
[man 2] They wouldn't give him leads.

15:16.123 --> 15:20.127
Or he'd be doing stage work,
or he'd be the prop man,

15:20.210 --> 15:22.212
but they never gave him respect.

15:22.296 --> 15:26.050
[Sly] I was so
self-consumed and insulated,

15:26.926 --> 15:29.553
and John… he was the same way.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.100
Sly started to write
because he couldn't get what he wanted,

15:35.184 --> 15:37.061
so he'd create it himself.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.731
And it wasn't anything like,

15:40.814 --> 15:44.151
"You thought about it,
and you were gonna do it." Just do it!

15:45.736 --> 15:48.656
[Sly] I said this is no good.
I don't want to act anymore.

15:48.739 --> 15:51.867
Maybe what I can do
is write all my frustrations

15:51.951 --> 15:53.285
and make screenplays.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.413
[Sly] I got a job as an usher.

15:56.497 --> 15:59.291
I could watch films all day long.

16:00.250 --> 16:02.670
And I would take a little
inexpensive tape recorder,

16:02.753 --> 16:05.381
record the soundtrack and the dialogue,

16:05.464 --> 16:07.883
and go home
and try to replace the dialogue.

16:07.967 --> 16:10.928
[Sly] That's what I started to do.
I wrote and wrote for a couple years

16:11.011 --> 16:13.472
until I had 15, 16 screenplays.

16:14.056 --> 16:18.310
[subway tracks rattling and squealing]

16:18.394 --> 16:21.146
[Sly] John and I, we were definitely
on a different wavelength,

16:21.230 --> 16:24.441
wanting to write our own stuff,
wanting to produce our own stuff.

16:24.525 --> 16:26.735
So every Friday, Saturday and Sunday

16:26.819 --> 16:29.697
was spent with
a bottle of Boone's Farm wine.

16:29.780 --> 16:34.868
Never went to a bar, a restaurant, a club.
That's when the writing really started.

16:37.329 --> 16:40.290
We'd discuss aspirations, dreams,

16:40.374 --> 16:42.084
but also movies.

16:42.584 --> 16:46.505
We would break in, sneak in somehow,

16:46.588 --> 16:48.382
to every movie in New York.

16:48.465 --> 16:51.135
Never paid for a ticket, ever.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.012
[up-tempo jazz music playing]

16:56.265 --> 17:00.394
[Sly] There was no possibility
in our minds for failure.

17:00.477 --> 17:04.189
Like, "Oh, what if we don't make it?"
Never entered the conversation.

17:04.273 --> 17:08.777
That's how driven and adamant
and committed to the concept…

17:08.861 --> 17:12.448
"Yeah, there's got to be a place for us,
because we're so weird."

17:12.531 --> 17:13.907
We have to fit in somewhere.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.410
We had to do something.
We had to make our own fate.

17:17.494 --> 17:20.831
That's why we said,
"We gotta do this movie called Horses."

17:22.291 --> 17:25.753
A cowboy and an Indian
come up from their grave,

17:25.836 --> 17:27.546
100 years after they were hung.

17:27.629 --> 17:29.631
[Sly] Got in a car, went to Maryland.

17:29.715 --> 17:31.091
We rented guns.

17:31.175 --> 17:34.094
When you see us, like,
shooting at the car, it's real ammo.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.263
I said, "What am I, crazy?"

17:36.346 --> 17:41.852
His father was reincarnated
as a sheriff who came to track us down.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.064
Of course, my father's in the movie.
My father shoots them.

17:45.147 --> 17:50.110
[Sly] The part where he kills us,
he enjoyed this a little too much.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.363
"I wanna shoot you, and then
I wanna come over and shoot you again."

17:53.447 --> 17:57.201
I said, "Is this sort of personal now?
A little biblical?"

17:59.495 --> 18:02.748
[Frank] It's a silent movie. I said,
"Sly, why don't you have any sound?"

18:02.831 --> 18:03.957
"Couldn't afford it."

18:04.041 --> 18:07.252
So you thought you were
going to shop a silent movie in 1971?

18:09.421 --> 18:11.715
[John] Doesn't matter
if it hasn't been done before.

18:11.799 --> 18:15.928
And he had, most importantly, a voice.
He wanted his voice to be heard.

18:16.762 --> 18:21.850
[Sly] In high school, I was considered
like a poster boy for how not to write.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.853
"Sylvester, you like to come up and read?"
I go, "Nah. No, thanks!"

18:24.937 --> 18:27.272
He goes, "Yes.
'Cause no one else wants to."

18:28.273 --> 18:31.401
The rejection, that's my encouragement.

18:31.485 --> 18:32.528
It's a challenge.

18:32.611 --> 18:35.614
Are you going to accept
their evaluation of you

18:35.697 --> 18:37.366
or are you going to evaluate yourself?

18:38.659 --> 18:42.579
[John] Sly always wanted to be an actor,

18:43.372 --> 18:46.416
but he always had to write.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.918
He wants to be an actor,

18:48.001 --> 18:50.504
and he needs someone to give him a role.

18:50.587 --> 18:53.132
He wasn't cast in things.

18:53.215 --> 18:58.846
He invented parts for himself
because he was probably deemed uncastable.

18:58.929 --> 19:01.640
[Sly] I had given up on acting.
I was done.

19:01.723 --> 19:05.310
But John Herzfeld
asked me to help him audition.

19:05.394 --> 19:08.981
In the audience is a guy
who's monitoring the class

19:09.064 --> 19:12.568
who was going to eventually
write and direct Lords of Flatbush.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.320
That was the beginning.

19:15.404 --> 19:18.365
It's a matter of just being
in the right place at the right time.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.744
I first met Sly on The Lords of Flatbush.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.332
[Sly] We were kind of just a real odd…
A really odd couple.

19:27.416 --> 19:30.335
He's Jewish, intellectual, Ivy League.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.546
I'm… [chuckles] I am what I am.

19:33.130 --> 19:38.594
And you couldn't get two people
more culturally opposite.

19:38.677 --> 19:43.557
He took me to his walk-up apartment
off of Lexington Avenue

19:43.640 --> 19:45.934
with his gigantic dog.

19:46.018 --> 19:51.064
And he painted
the windows black so he could write.

19:53.233 --> 19:57.029
I read the screenplay,
and it was pretty simplistic.

19:57.112 --> 20:00.991
So I said,
"Let me be myself in this scene."

20:01.074 --> 20:03.660
For example,
when I'm sitting behind the girl.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.954
"Mr. Rosiello, what are you doing?"

20:06.038 --> 20:07.664
"I don't know, I'm just sitting."

20:07.748 --> 20:10.209
"I'm sliding up because the sun
is getting in my eye… my eye…"

20:10.292 --> 20:12.002
"My eyes, I can't see."

20:12.085 --> 20:14.213
And then she goes back to teaching.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.131
A moment later, I slide close to the girl.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.550
I got my arm around her.
She goes, "Mr. Rosiello!"

20:18.634 --> 20:21.094
"I don't know what it is!
The sun keeps following me."

20:21.178 --> 20:24.932
"I'm going here, I'm going there."
Just doing all this nonsense, winging it.

20:25.682 --> 20:27.517
And I realized this is…

20:27.601 --> 20:30.562
this is an opportunity
that they allowed me.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.565
I'm going to say whatever I want
throughout the whole film.

20:33.649 --> 20:37.861
Sly was always rewriting the script,

20:37.945 --> 20:40.489
improving the scenes he was in.

20:40.572 --> 20:43.450
Lords of Flatbush was really
the first time we got a sense

20:43.533 --> 20:45.869
of Sylvester Stallone's voice
before Rocky.

20:45.953 --> 20:49.289
The best scene in the movie, if not
one of the best scenes in '70's cinema,

20:49.373 --> 20:50.332
as far as I'm concerned,

20:50.415 --> 20:52.834
is the scene where he's persuaded
by his fiancée, Maria Smith,

20:52.918 --> 20:56.588
to buy an engagement ring that
this dumb lug obviously cannot afford.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.882
The girl that just walked out of there,

20:58.966 --> 21:01.969
if you ever show her a $1,600 ring again,

21:02.052 --> 21:04.513
you know what's going to be
written on your tombstone? Huh?

21:04.596 --> 21:06.682
You know what's going to be
written on your tombstone?

21:07.391 --> 21:12.104
"I was dumb enough to show
Frannie Malincanico a $1,600 ring."

21:12.187 --> 21:14.773
Stanley is an interesting character
in that movie,

21:14.856 --> 21:16.566
but you don't necessarily like him.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.236
He's just… He's such a lug.

21:19.319 --> 21:21.571
But in that scene
he makes you fall in love with him

21:21.655 --> 21:26.034
'cause you realize the extent
to how much he actually loves Frannie.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.705
It's our first glimpse
of the musicality or the sound

21:29.788 --> 21:31.581
of Sylvester Stallone's dialogue.

21:31.665 --> 21:32.666
Damn.

21:32.749 --> 21:38.213
At that point, I knew forever
my fate was determined on the pen.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.174
'Cause I knew I was so hard to cast.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.385
I was always cast as a thug.

21:43.468 --> 21:45.804
I go, "Okay, that's true. I am."

21:45.887 --> 21:49.391
But I'm also nice.
I'm… I'm kind of a soft touch.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.059
If you could put that together,

21:51.143 --> 21:53.103
that would really be a great character.

21:53.186 --> 21:56.315
And I didn't have that opportunity
until Rocky came around.

21:56.398 --> 22:00.902
But the precursor was Stanley Rosiello
in The Lords of Flatbush,

22:00.986 --> 22:03.322
where I saw there's a tough goon,

22:03.405 --> 22:07.451
motorcycle jacket, greasy hair, cigarette,
but you really liked him.

22:07.534 --> 22:10.329
[twangy electric guitar music playing]

22:21.173 --> 22:22.799
[Sly] One thing led to another.

22:24.885 --> 22:27.721
If they hadn't offered me the part,
if I didn't get good reviews,

22:27.804 --> 22:29.639
I never would've made enough,
made 1,300 bucks,

22:29.723 --> 22:35.312
just enough to get a $40 car
and drive… 11 days to Hollywood.

22:37.731 --> 22:41.526
The only one I knew in LA
was Henry Winkler,

22:42.069 --> 22:44.237
who is now a big star as the Fonz.

22:48.033 --> 22:50.202
My car breaks down on Hollywood and Vine.

22:50.285 --> 22:53.455
Just boom, stops. Like, it was prophetic.

22:54.373 --> 22:57.000
And the first phone call
I made was to Henry.

22:59.836 --> 23:02.005
[mimics Sly]
"Yeah, you gotta come pick me up."

23:02.547 --> 23:04.049
"My car broke down."

23:04.132 --> 23:06.968
"I'm here, right in the middle
of Sunset Boulevard."

23:07.052 --> 23:08.553
I said, "I will be right there."

23:08.637 --> 23:12.015
I went and got him
and this mountain of a dog.

23:12.099 --> 23:16.895
All of his clothes in the car somehow,
sitting on suitcases.

23:16.978 --> 23:20.440
[Sly] He obviously couldn't take me
to his house. I got a dog, a wife.

23:20.524 --> 23:22.526
He pointed me
in the direction of this motel,

23:22.609 --> 23:25.695
and I ended up there
for, like, three nights.

23:25.779 --> 23:29.199
And then I found some dump
way in the Valley,

23:29.282 --> 23:31.868
one street away from Balboa Boulevard.

23:33.912 --> 23:35.288
All right.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.332
[tape player clicks]

23:37.416 --> 23:41.545
[Sly on tape] I had been introduced
to Gene Kirkwood, the executive producer.

23:41.628 --> 23:45.257
And we had talked
and then I had given him the idea, Rocky,

23:45.340 --> 23:48.176
and we developed it,
and lo and behold, it came out.

23:48.260 --> 23:53.265
And it was a series of circumstances
which are really, I guess, a bit unusual,

23:53.348 --> 23:55.851
because I had a very limited track record.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.019
-So it was…
-How about no track record?

23:58.103 --> 24:01.356
…a benevolent and wonderful
chain of mistakes that came out.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.109
Yeah, you know,
it's simplifying everything.

24:04.192 --> 24:06.820
[emotional music playing]

24:10.365 --> 24:13.243
[Sly] I was there for,
actually, an acting audition,

24:13.326 --> 24:15.704
and things were going not too well.

24:16.872 --> 24:19.749
And on the way out,
the door was just about closing,

24:19.833 --> 24:21.418
I lean back in the door and I go,

24:21.501 --> 24:25.839
"Oh, by the way, I write a little bit."
And he goes, "Really? Come back in."

24:27.299 --> 24:28.717
[Sly] I started writing,

24:30.302 --> 24:33.763
and I started doing
something derivative of Mean Streets.

24:33.847 --> 24:37.517
I want to do a collector. I want to do
that kind of gritty street thing.

24:37.601 --> 24:41.021
And I'm knocking it out,
dog sitting there on the desk,

24:41.104 --> 24:45.025
and I'm working, I'm smoking cigarettes,
and I'm pounding coffee away.

24:45.817 --> 24:47.569
And it's coming together.

24:47.652 --> 24:49.738
-[rubbing hands]
-It's just… It's working.

24:50.238 --> 24:51.823
But there is…

24:53.158 --> 24:56.453
a… a thuggery about Rocky.

24:56.536 --> 24:59.331
At the time, my friend, she was typing it,

25:00.290 --> 25:01.249
she started crying.

25:01.333 --> 25:05.212
She goes, "I hate Rocky.
I hate him. He's cruel."

25:05.921 --> 25:08.381
"He… He hits people. He beats them up."

25:08.465 --> 25:11.301
I said, "What if you stop short of it?
Like, maybe he almost did."

25:11.384 --> 25:14.054
"He could have,
that's his job, but he doesn't?"

25:14.137 --> 25:15.472
"That'd be nice."

25:15.555 --> 25:17.849
I said, "What if he had
a girlfriend or something?"

25:17.933 --> 25:19.559
"Yeah, that's nice."

25:19.643 --> 25:21.353
So I go back. [makes whooshing sound]

25:21.436 --> 25:23.271
Start writing that. "Girlfriend. Nice."

25:23.355 --> 25:28.151
But he's not a fighter now.
He's just a guy. There's really no story.

25:28.235 --> 25:32.531
He's just a guy, like, on the fringe,

25:32.614 --> 25:34.366
a, um… a bum.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.201
He's a bum!

25:36.284 --> 25:40.205
And now I hearken back
to On the Waterfront. He's Terry Malloy.

25:41.248 --> 25:44.209
Bang. Marty, movie, Mean Streets. Whoosh!

25:44.292 --> 25:47.212
Boom. [imitates gears whirring] Mix it up.

25:47.295 --> 25:49.464
And then throw your spin on it.

25:50.173 --> 25:53.343
And then it all came together
once he became a fighter.

25:57.222 --> 25:59.766
[Sly on tape] I had $106,
the rent was $300.

25:59.849 --> 26:03.645
I had that kind of dilemma.
I could hear the wolf at the door.

26:05.105 --> 26:07.482
I wrote it in three days.

26:08.942 --> 26:12.153
Then, of course, I went back
and rewrote and rewrote and rewrote it.

26:13.446 --> 26:16.366
I'm a big believer,
when I write, to not worry about

26:16.449 --> 26:17.784
the flawed aspect of it.

26:17.867 --> 26:20.328
I know that maybe 90% is worthless,

26:20.412 --> 26:23.999
but the idea that you have
a beginning, middle, and an end

26:24.082 --> 26:25.500
is very important to me.

26:25.584 --> 26:29.546
Producers are going, "We'd like
to cast Ryan O'Neal. He likes to box."

26:29.629 --> 26:31.339
"Or Burt Reynolds."

26:31.423 --> 26:33.633
I go, "No, I'm writing it for me."

26:36.970 --> 26:40.307
[interviewer] They liked the script,
but were so desperate not to have you,

26:40.390 --> 26:43.685
that they kept offering increasingly large
sums of money to go away, didn't they?

26:43.768 --> 26:47.063
[Sly chuckling] You're right.
It went up to about $265,000.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.316
-Not to appear in the film.
-[Sly] Right, to stay away.

26:49.399 --> 26:53.361
I knew that if I sold it,
even for $500,000,

26:53.445 --> 26:55.071
I knew that after the money was gone

26:55.155 --> 26:57.198
I would become very bitter
for having sold out.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.700
What is healthier?

26:59.743 --> 27:01.077
To live under the illusion

27:01.161 --> 27:05.373
and still have a little glimmer of hope
that you could have been great,

27:05.457 --> 27:08.168
or actually have
an opportunity to be great

27:08.251 --> 27:11.212
and then you blow it,
and you realize you're a failure.

27:12.172 --> 27:16.551
So I think that the easier route
is to live under the illusion and say,

27:16.635 --> 27:20.597
"You know, if I'd had that chance,
I would have beaten all of them."

27:22.307 --> 27:24.934
I walked into that trailer
for the first time

27:25.018 --> 27:27.270
under the cold streets of Philadelphia

27:28.229 --> 27:30.482
and I knew this was the moment of truth.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.903
And they said, "Sylvester, are you ready?"

27:35.487 --> 27:37.280
I said, "No."

27:37.364 --> 27:38.615
"But Rocky is."

27:39.199 --> 27:41.534
What happened was something extraordinary.

27:41.618 --> 27:45.246
We knew this thing was taking place.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.332
[crowd cheering faintly]

27:47.415 --> 27:50.752
[Sly] All the actors I wanted,
every one of them fell out,

27:50.835 --> 27:54.255
and they were replaced
with perfect actors.

27:55.382 --> 27:58.385
Apollo Creed? There's only
one guy in the world who could do that.

27:58.468 --> 28:00.929
He had the voice, the size,
the thing, the arrogance.

28:01.012 --> 28:04.182
We were gonna use Ken Norton,
but he fell out two nights before,

28:04.265 --> 28:05.809
and I thought, "Oh, boy."

28:05.892 --> 28:07.936
[melancholy music playing]

28:08.019 --> 28:10.271
[Sly] I really believe
in divine intervention.

28:12.399 --> 28:18.154
Talia Shire was also a last-minute choice
because we couldn't find the right person.

28:20.573 --> 28:24.202
She comes in,
and as soon as that door opened,

28:24.285 --> 28:26.955
it was like this light. Wham.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.834
And I walked up to her
and she had this blue-black hair

28:30.917 --> 28:33.753
and these… these eyes looking like this.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.464
I went, "I love this girl."

28:36.548 --> 28:39.634
I love this character, this thing.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.302
There's something here.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.222
I'm not even going to question it.
You don't have to read.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.599
You are it.

28:46.683 --> 28:49.686
The same thing happened
all the way down the line.

28:50.729 --> 28:54.274
[Sly] Rocky is not
a fight story by any means.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.943
It's a simple character study
of a man who…

28:57.026 --> 28:58.027
A love story.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.279
…who should be cynical.

28:59.362 --> 29:01.448
-It's a love story.
-But he's incapable of it.

29:01.531 --> 29:02.490
[tapping on tape player]

29:02.574 --> 29:04.242
-Love story.
-He accepts life.

29:05.869 --> 29:09.330
-Simply, that's his, uh, his lot in life.
-Say it.

29:10.415 --> 29:14.586
One thing he wants more than anything else
is not to grow old alone.

29:14.669 --> 29:15.712
Say it.

29:16.796 --> 29:20.133
[producer] That young guy there
could not get to the place of love.

29:20.216 --> 29:22.594
-He could not say it out loud.
-[Sly] No.

29:22.677 --> 29:23.928
Yeah, you're right.

29:24.512 --> 29:26.723
I couldn't say it back then.

29:26.806 --> 29:27.807
[tape player clicks]

29:33.354 --> 29:36.983
[Sly] I'm sitting there waiting to do
a scene with Adrian on the ice.

29:38.902 --> 29:41.404
"Guess what?
The 300 extras have been cut."

29:41.488 --> 29:43.948
How many do I have? He goes, "None."

29:44.032 --> 29:45.992
And how long do we have to shoot?

29:46.075 --> 29:47.327
"Maybe two hours."

29:49.120 --> 29:50.705
And I went, "Wow."

29:51.331 --> 29:52.832
"This could be even better."

29:55.335 --> 30:00.006
Rocky really observes, and he sees
things that other people don't see,

30:00.089 --> 30:01.299
trying to bring her out.

30:01.382 --> 30:06.095
[Talia] He was exploring
vulnerability, nurturing,

30:06.179 --> 30:07.972
transformation.

30:08.056 --> 30:11.100
So we have to begin a character here

30:11.184 --> 30:12.560
to go there.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.437
[Rocky] You know
how I got started in fighting?

30:14.521 --> 30:16.439
-[Adrian] No.
-[Rocky] My old man.

30:16.523 --> 30:20.151
He was never too smart. He says to me,
"You weren't born much of a brain,

30:20.235 --> 30:23.571
so you better start using your body."
Right? So I become a fighter.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.573
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah. [laughs]

30:25.657 --> 30:27.492
Why you… Why you laughing?

30:28.868 --> 30:31.704
My mother, she said the opposite thing.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.915
What'd she say?
What'd she say, the opposite?

30:34.707 --> 30:37.085
[sighs] She said, "You weren't born
with much of a body,

30:37.168 --> 30:38.837
so you better develop your brain."

30:38.920 --> 30:40.296
Did she say that?

30:40.380 --> 30:42.382
[emotional music playing]

30:43.299 --> 30:44.843
Adrian was extraordinary.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.719
He wrote that woman,

30:46.803 --> 30:49.514
a woman who was oppressed and discarded.

30:50.974 --> 30:55.812
He would lift Adrian
to a moment of freedom and beauty.

30:56.896 --> 30:57.772
And love.

30:59.107 --> 31:03.194
[Sly] What Talia did… is elevate it

31:03.278 --> 31:05.697
from a boxing film to a love story.

31:05.780 --> 31:08.992
And her boyfriend happened to be a boxer.

31:09.075 --> 31:12.328
He finally had something to fight for.

31:12.412 --> 31:15.164
It wasn't money. It was pride.

31:15.748 --> 31:18.376
"I want you to be proud."

31:19.335 --> 31:23.131
I… I want you to say, "That's my man."

31:23.214 --> 31:24.924
And that's why he said at the end,

31:25.008 --> 31:27.051
"I don't wanna be
another bum from the neighborhood."

31:27.135 --> 31:31.055
"I don't care if I get beaten to a pulp.
I want you to be proud."

31:33.057 --> 31:35.393
That's all I want to do,
is go the distance.

31:39.689 --> 31:44.569
That's what I liked about the character.
He just somehow always kept it inside.

31:44.652 --> 31:48.323
He never shared his grief
or his disappointment with anyone,

31:48.406 --> 31:49.782
just himself.

31:49.866 --> 31:54.704
The only time he ever lets it out
is when Mickey leaves the apartment.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.751
The scene, the way it was written,
I come out of that bathroom

31:59.834 --> 32:01.878
and look pensively and then go after him.

32:01.961 --> 32:06.215
I said, "John, please just do me a favor.
Keep the cameras running, the sound going,

32:06.299 --> 32:10.470
and let's just see if Rocky
can sum up his life in two minutes."

32:10.970 --> 32:13.389
First time we did this, and it was great,

32:13.473 --> 32:16.726
John goes, "Oh, was that a take?"

32:16.809 --> 32:18.227
I went, "Was that a take?"

32:19.562 --> 32:20.521
"That was

32:21.689 --> 32:23.691
an improvisation."

32:24.609 --> 32:26.986
"And I can't do it again. It's an improv."

32:27.070 --> 32:30.073
The energy is not there. You know, it's…

32:30.156 --> 32:33.326
Okay, what did I do before?
Did I hit the door here?

32:33.409 --> 32:36.412
I said, "Fuck it, I gotta
start from scratch. What did I do?"

32:36.913 --> 32:39.415
And then I started
thinking about my father.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.542
Listen to me. I want to be your manager.

32:41.626 --> 32:45.713
[Sly] So I had to throw out the best take…

32:45.797 --> 32:48.091
But you can't buy
what I'm going to give you.

32:48.174 --> 32:50.551
I mean, I've got pain
and I've got experience.

32:50.635 --> 32:52.762
I got pain and I got experience too…

32:52.845 --> 32:56.391
[Sly] …and replace it
with something even more volatile,

32:56.474 --> 32:57.767
my relationship with my father.

32:57.850 --> 32:59.644
I needed your help about ten years ago.

32:59.727 --> 33:01.938
Ten years ago, you never helped me none.

33:02.021 --> 33:04.440
-You didn't care.
-Well, if you wanted help…

33:05.191 --> 33:07.610
I say, if you wanted help,
why didn't you ask?

33:07.694 --> 33:09.404
Why didn't you just ask me, kid?

33:09.487 --> 33:12.073
[Rocky] Look, I asked,
but you never heard nothin'!

33:12.156 --> 33:14.867
[Sly] And when I wrote it,
it was just one line,

33:14.951 --> 33:18.538
and I got there and went,
"I need to talk about me."

33:19.205 --> 33:20.081
Me.

33:20.164 --> 33:22.250
And I'm going to put it in Rocky's body.

33:22.333 --> 33:25.003
So I was just turning 30, and I said,

33:25.086 --> 33:29.924
"You come up here and you offer this?
Well, I'm past my prime. What prime?"

33:30.008 --> 33:33.177
"I'm gonna sit there, get an opportunity,
I'm gonna fall on my face."

33:33.261 --> 33:35.847
Like I thought the movie,
I was going to bomb.

33:35.930 --> 33:38.808
"Why couldn't you have
been here when I needed you?"

33:39.851 --> 33:44.689
If I can take my frustration and voice it,

33:45.398 --> 33:49.986
I have a funny feeling
that there's millions of people

33:50.611 --> 33:54.365
that have that same frustration,
that were passed over.

33:55.074 --> 33:56.034
Overlooked.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.368
I'm gonna get that!

33:58.870 --> 34:00.872
And you wanna be ringside to see it?

34:00.955 --> 34:02.832
Do you? You wanna help me out?

34:02.915 --> 34:04.625
Do you wanna see me get my…

34:04.709 --> 34:07.462
[Sly] I could never say that
to the man's face.

34:07.545 --> 34:10.798
It would have been so disrespectful.

34:10.882 --> 34:13.801
And you don't want a dialogue.

34:13.885 --> 34:16.220
[somber music playing]

34:17.930 --> 34:22.643
[Sly] Everyone is going to assume
this old man is done.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.729
-And then, bang…
-[claps hands]

34:24.812 --> 34:28.316
That door opens,
Bill Conti's cue comes in,

34:28.399 --> 34:30.443
and there's hope.

34:31.319 --> 34:35.156
There it is, there is
what everybody ever wanted

34:35.239 --> 34:38.284
that was shunned or denied an opportunity.

34:38.826 --> 34:40.787
"Come on. Come on back."

34:40.870 --> 34:45.208
[discordant electric guitar music builds]

34:49.253 --> 34:53.299
Oh my God.
This is the theater where Rocky premiered.

34:54.133 --> 34:56.177
The same theater I ushered at.

34:56.260 --> 35:00.181
The first review we got out of New York
by Vincent Canby was scathing,

35:00.264 --> 35:02.225
so I didn't know what to expect.

35:04.310 --> 35:07.438
We screen Rocky
five days before the release.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.649
It was an afternoon matinée.

35:09.732 --> 35:13.027
I was sitting there with him,
and all of a sudden he's going, "Oh shit."

35:14.779 --> 35:18.199
Twenty minutes into it,
the audience, three-quarters were gone.

35:19.826 --> 35:21.536
And the studio heads are going…

35:22.870 --> 35:25.456
And I'm getting lower in the seat.
I'm going, "Oh shit."

35:25.540 --> 35:28.167
Talk about a crestfallen look.
He said, "Oh God."

35:28.251 --> 35:30.837
He thought, "Man,
this is going to be a bomb."

35:33.297 --> 35:37.135
So, when it did open,
my confidence was not soaring.

35:38.094 --> 35:41.514
In here is where they had
the premiere of Rocky.

35:41.597 --> 35:44.725
I remember I was standing across
the street over there in a trench coat.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.352
My brother goes,

35:46.435 --> 35:49.522
"This could be the best day
or the worst day of your life."

35:49.605 --> 35:51.774
-I go, "Yeah, this is it."
-[flashbulb pops]

35:51.858 --> 35:54.610
[Sly] And if this didn't go,
there was no second chance.

35:54.694 --> 35:55.820
[thundering boom]

35:55.903 --> 35:58.156
[grunting]

35:58.239 --> 35:59.365
[camera shutter clicks]

35:59.448 --> 36:03.494
[Sly] When everyone's inside,
I go to the back, and I'm standing there.

36:04.537 --> 36:07.290
It's almost like it's a still painting.

36:07.373 --> 36:08.541
[subway tracks screeching]

36:08.624 --> 36:12.461
No one is moving.
Everyone is listening to every word.

36:12.545 --> 36:15.256
[thudding and grunting]

36:15.339 --> 36:17.175
[Sly] Like, boom. Riveted.

36:17.258 --> 36:19.760
[subway tracks screeching and rattling]

36:20.887 --> 36:22.555
[echoing thud]

36:23.723 --> 36:27.727
[audience roars, fades]

36:28.561 --> 36:30.313
[Sly] When he knocks Apollo down,

36:31.981 --> 36:33.524
whole theater went up,

36:33.608 --> 36:36.903
and the producers all look,
and it's like, "Holy shit."

36:37.612 --> 36:41.449
The audience is participating
like it's a real sporting event.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.326
We blurred the lines.

36:44.535 --> 36:47.330
You could hear the cheers from the inside

36:47.413 --> 36:49.332
outside on the street from the theater.

36:49.415 --> 36:55.004
We just assumed he would be a joke
out there fighting against Creed.

36:55.755 --> 36:58.507
But when he knocks him on his back
in the first round,

36:58.591 --> 37:02.595
that kind of excitement,
it was almost unheard of.

37:02.678 --> 37:05.681
-[audience cheering loudly]
-["To Hell With Poverty" plays]

37:05.765 --> 37:08.267
Nobody, nobody,
remembers that Rocky loses.

37:08.351 --> 37:12.605
I mean, the movie is rigged
to make you feel like he's won.

37:12.688 --> 37:15.441
It was one of the really
glorious moments of…

37:15.524 --> 37:18.653
of an audience reacting
to the drama onscreen.

37:18.736 --> 37:22.198
The movie opens up number one.
Everyone was talking about…

37:22.281 --> 37:23.574
"This movie has heart."

37:23.658 --> 37:26.452
"It is emotional. It made me cry."

37:26.535 --> 37:28.246
"It made me inspired."

37:29.705 --> 37:33.709
To see that fairy-tale story come to life,
it just turned the audience on.

37:35.378 --> 37:37.505
Something happened, something magical.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.591
[Frank] It's the last picture
of him being unknown.

37:41.509 --> 37:44.720
[Sly] And there's never going to be
another private moment again.

37:45.388 --> 37:48.516
[man 1] And here comes Rocky himself,
Sylvester Stallone!

37:49.725 --> 37:53.771
Literally, a complete
transformative moment in life,

37:53.854 --> 37:55.940
but forever. Like, wham!

37:57.608 --> 37:59.402
[man 2] And the winner is…

38:00.236 --> 38:01.404
Rocky.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.705
The star of Rocky,
Sylvester "Sly" Stallone.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.873
[woman] Please welcome Sylvester Stallone.

38:12.957 --> 38:15.251
[audience applauding]

38:28.347 --> 38:31.183
[Arnold] So he was hailed as an actor,
he was hailed as a writer,

38:31.267 --> 38:34.854
he was hailed for just being a visionary
and all of this stuff,

38:34.937 --> 38:36.314
and, bang, there he was.

38:36.397 --> 38:39.275
From that point on,
he could do nothing wrong.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.485
[music fades out]

38:44.822 --> 38:47.700
[Sly on tape]
I'm torn apart sometimes thinking that…

38:47.783 --> 38:50.202
what is it all about,
and is it really all worth it?

38:50.286 --> 38:53.831
I go through a very gloomy period
that perhaps I'm deceiving myself.

38:53.914 --> 38:56.876
I collect my thoughts and all I have to do
is look in the mirror.

38:56.959 --> 39:01.881
I'm kind of like the living embodiment of
what happened to Rocky has happened to me.

39:02.381 --> 39:04.050
[Sly] Within a week,

39:04.133 --> 39:07.303
they were saying things about me
that I know I could never live up to.

39:07.386 --> 39:10.639
And then they were
saying things that… that were…

39:11.807 --> 39:14.810
I guess… a little infuriating.

39:16.479 --> 39:20.107
[Quentin] The first time I ever heard
anything about Rocky was a radio spot.

39:20.191 --> 39:24.278
"Every once in a while,
a new actor emerges,

39:24.362 --> 39:27.865
and he becomes one of the most talked
about sensations in the film business."

39:28.574 --> 39:30.242
"That was Marlon Brando."

39:30.326 --> 39:33.079
"That was Al Pacino.
That was Robert De Niro."

39:33.162 --> 39:34.830
"And this year…" [chuckles]

39:34.914 --> 39:38.501
"…the actor that everyone will be
talking about is Sylvester Stallone."

39:38.584 --> 39:40.336
Who the fuck is Sylvester Stallone?

39:40.419 --> 39:42.296
Then I finally see a TV spot.

39:42.380 --> 39:46.425
Stanley from Lords of Flatbush
is Sylvester Stallone?!

39:47.009 --> 39:51.013
He's the greatest actor to come out
since Robert De Niro and Marlon Brando?

39:51.097 --> 39:52.431
Wow. Okay.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.434
Fairly presumptuous of you
to expect to be able to star in it,

39:55.518 --> 39:58.229
because your career up to then
had been small parts, right?

39:58.312 --> 40:01.148
[chuckles] That's kind of you
to even say small.

40:01.232 --> 40:04.693
But I felt that, jeez,
if I was going to go down,

40:04.777 --> 40:07.154
at least into professional obscurity,

40:07.238 --> 40:10.908
I wanted to at least have the opportunity
to say to myself, "Well, you tried."

40:10.991 --> 40:13.369
If nothing else, I had a good home movie.

40:13.452 --> 40:15.204
My parents would enjoy it.

40:15.287 --> 40:17.748
[somber music playing]

40:17.832 --> 40:22.169
[John] Rocky comes out.
A few months later, Sly's dad calls me.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.046
"John, can I come over and see you?"

40:24.130 --> 40:25.423
He says, "I got a script."

40:26.173 --> 40:29.093
"I got the real Rocky."
"What do you mean?"

40:29.176 --> 40:31.137
"I wrote the real Rocky."

40:32.721 --> 40:34.306
"You wrote a boxing movie?" "Yeah."

40:34.390 --> 40:36.809
"Did you give it to Sly?"
"No, I want you to read it."

40:36.892 --> 40:39.061
"Maybe you can make it."
"No, that's… Frank."

40:39.145 --> 40:44.859
"Why don't you give it to Sly to read?
But I think that area has been done."

40:46.861 --> 40:49.155
He was still competing with Sly.

40:50.573 --> 40:53.075
[Frank] He goes, "Hey, I'm writing
a script called Sonny."

40:53.159 --> 40:55.911
Sly goes, "What's that about?"
"It's like Rocky, Sonny."

40:55.995 --> 40:58.747
Sly goes, "You can't do that, Dad.
It's my creation."

41:00.249 --> 41:03.335
I think my father was jealous.
I said, "What are you jealous of?"

41:04.086 --> 41:07.089
"He worked his ass off.
You didn't help him. He did this."

41:09.758 --> 41:13.846
Success can really
wreak havoc on a family.

41:13.929 --> 41:17.725
Unbeknownst to me, my career was just
canceled overnight when Rocky came out.

41:17.808 --> 41:19.894
All of a sudden, I became Rocky's brother.

41:19.977 --> 41:23.063
[Sly] It was hard on him.
My brother is very, very creative,

41:23.147 --> 41:26.525
and he was
pretty traumatized by my success.

41:27.109 --> 41:30.571
[Frank] No one was expecting him
to be, like, an American icon.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.658
[Sly] Once you get to your dream,

41:35.367 --> 41:37.328
you realize, this wasn't my dream.

41:37.411 --> 41:39.246
My dream has not made…

41:39.330 --> 41:41.290
It's not turned out the way I thought.

41:41.373 --> 41:43.375
It comes also with, uh…

41:44.460 --> 41:45.836
like, a storm front

41:47.046 --> 41:50.591
that you're constantly battling
because you're disappointed.

41:50.674 --> 41:51.717
You go, "Oh shit."

41:51.800 --> 41:56.597
"I thought once I made it to the top
of the mountain, it was all blue skies."

41:56.680 --> 41:58.140
It's not.

41:58.224 --> 42:01.519
The air is thinner. It's precarious.

42:02.269 --> 42:05.272
There's not many people up there.
It's pretty lonely.

42:05.356 --> 42:09.068
So sometimes going to the mountain
is not as… all it's cracked up to be.

42:09.151 --> 42:13.239
I think when Stallone
became famous with Rocky,

42:14.365 --> 42:19.161
he wasn't expecting the downside
that can happen with celebrity.

42:19.245 --> 42:20.996
[bombastic fanfare plays]

42:21.080 --> 42:24.041
[announcer] From Hollywood,
it's the Dinah! show.

42:24.124 --> 42:26.293
And he wasn't expecting people to say,

42:26.377 --> 42:28.963
"Now you have to do it again,
now you have to prove it again."

42:29.046 --> 42:30.464
[announcer] And you're invited

42:30.548 --> 42:32.716
along with Rocky himself,
Sylvester Stallone.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.886
[Dinah] This is your second film
and everybody, all the world,

42:35.970 --> 42:39.890
is waiting to see
what happens with Sylvester Stallone.

42:39.974 --> 42:42.601
-Yeah.
-Was he, uh, a one-time shot?

42:45.312 --> 42:47.773
[Sly] Right after Rocky,
people had built me into something

42:47.856 --> 42:50.734
perhaps bigger than
I should have been built into.

42:52.027 --> 42:55.322
Right away, they were
beginning to question my ability.

42:55.406 --> 42:56.907
I was looking at many scripts.

42:56.991 --> 42:59.243
Nothing was interesting.
Then F.I.S.T. came along.

42:59.326 --> 43:01.662
This would be a true departure from Rocky.

43:01.745 --> 43:04.582
A film that deals with
the American labor movement,

43:04.665 --> 43:07.668
the conception of
a very powerful trucking union.

43:07.751 --> 43:11.005
It's a fantastic odyssey, I believe.

43:11.088 --> 43:16.969
That area in the wake of Rocky
is him struggling to figure out

43:17.052 --> 43:21.390
how to both maybe repeat that
and differentiate himself from it.

43:21.473 --> 43:25.269
Stallone, at that time,
was such a huge star.

43:25.352 --> 43:28.814
The first thing he wanted to do
was he wanted to rewrite the picture.

43:28.897 --> 43:31.650
[Wesley] I think a lot of the problems
on the sets of some of his films

43:31.734 --> 43:34.695
have to do with the fact
that he has a sense of,

43:34.778 --> 43:38.324
like, what is working for a movie,

43:38.407 --> 43:41.577
and is at odds with the people
who've been hired by the studios

43:41.660 --> 43:43.120
to make these things.

43:43.203 --> 43:47.958
A gigantic issue with Sly, he didn't want
to die at the end of the movie.

43:48.042 --> 43:49.710
[Sly] I think he did something very wrong.

43:49.793 --> 43:52.171
He killed the hero off in the end

43:52.254 --> 43:54.590
and let evil triumph,

43:54.673 --> 43:56.008
which you can't do that.

43:56.091 --> 43:57.718
That may happen in reality a lot,

43:57.801 --> 43:59.720
but when people go in and pay good money,

43:59.803 --> 44:03.307
they sometimes like
to see righteousness pay off.

44:03.390 --> 44:05.893
[Quentin] To promote F.I.S.T.,
he does one of those Playboy interviews.

44:05.976 --> 44:09.897
He pontificates that he doesn't think
it's possible for him ever to have a flop,

44:09.980 --> 44:11.815
that that will actually never happen,

44:11.899 --> 44:14.526
that it's not possible
for him to have a flop.

44:14.610 --> 44:16.987
[man] Despite its flaws,
I found a lot to admire in F.I.S.T.

44:17.071 --> 44:19.365
But many critics didn't agree with me,

44:19.448 --> 44:22.493
and their disagreement
was a personal insult for Sylvester.

44:22.576 --> 44:25.704
[Sly] When they start calling F.I.S.T.
J.U.N.K., I take that personally.

44:25.788 --> 44:28.957
I gave up the best of myself
for that film.

44:29.041 --> 44:30.292
I really worked hard.

44:30.376 --> 44:35.047
And so for some men, in 500 words,
to completely discredit all that effort,

44:35.130 --> 44:39.051
I would love to make an appointment
with them in any alley that they choose.

44:39.134 --> 44:41.387
[man] The success of Rocky
and the mistakes of F.I.S.T.

44:41.470 --> 44:45.057
have combined to inspire
Sylvester Stallone to make his own movie.

44:45.140 --> 44:47.768
All his own.
Writing, directing, and acting.

44:48.352 --> 44:51.063
Originally, Paradise Alley
was like the father of Rocky.

44:51.146 --> 44:53.565
I had written that in 1972.

44:53.649 --> 44:55.818
And no one ever wanted to touch it.

44:55.901 --> 44:57.319
A little too weird.

44:57.403 --> 44:59.238
So I went out and I wrote Rocky.

44:59.321 --> 45:02.324
Then the time came
when I wanted to do Paradise Alley

45:02.408 --> 45:04.535
and it dealt with the ring again.

45:04.618 --> 45:07.496
I thought, if I can make this
not as serious as Rocky,

45:07.579 --> 45:10.082
but really kind of like a carnival…

45:10.165 --> 45:13.210
The rain and the colors
and the characters,

45:13.293 --> 45:16.839
a little bit more would transcend
your normal wrestling match.

45:16.922 --> 45:19.758
[Sly] Back then, I was a young guy
trying to make something

45:19.842 --> 45:21.760
kind of clever and entertaining.

45:21.844 --> 45:24.054
I didn't really do my research

45:24.138 --> 45:27.433
and realize it was
such a niche kind of film.

45:27.516 --> 45:30.477
This is not broad-based.
It's kind of weird.

45:31.019 --> 45:34.356
1946, odd music, odd this, odd that.

45:34.940 --> 45:39.027
That I was setting myself up
for a disaster,

45:39.111 --> 45:40.279
and disaster struck.

45:41.029 --> 45:43.157
[Quentin] He wasn't expecting
F.I.S.T. to not do well,

45:43.240 --> 45:45.701
and he wasn't expecting
the critics who championed Rocky

45:45.784 --> 45:48.787
to turn viciously against Paradise Alley.

45:48.871 --> 45:50.289
He didn't handle it well.

45:50.372 --> 45:54.126
He started popping off,
challenging critics to fight.

45:55.961 --> 45:59.506
[Sly] Some days I wake up in the morning
and go, "I got this."

45:59.590 --> 46:01.550
And other days I go, "I don't have it."

46:01.633 --> 46:03.761
I don't feel it. It's not there.

46:03.844 --> 46:04.887
I'm flying blind.

46:04.970 --> 46:08.182
It's like going into a fight
and saying, "I don't know…"

46:09.433 --> 46:12.936
I've just learned that that will pass.

46:13.020 --> 46:14.730
Just hang in there.

46:14.813 --> 46:19.234
Don't have your anxiety attacks.
Let that fear… That's all part of it.

46:19.318 --> 46:22.946
That's what makes it interesting,
is you're afraid of it.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.616
The success story
of the character, Rocky Balboa,

46:25.699 --> 46:29.661
is strikingly similar to the success story
of the star, Sylvester Stallone.

46:29.745 --> 46:34.041
And nowadays, Stallone is putting
the finishing touches on Rocky II

46:34.124 --> 46:36.084
as writer, director, and star,

46:36.168 --> 46:40.547
with no noticeable anxiety about
the perennial dangers of doing a sequel.

46:40.631 --> 46:44.092
In fact, as usual,
Stallone is completely confident.

46:44.676 --> 46:46.804
[Sly] John Avildsen
wanted to go off Rocky.

46:46.887 --> 46:50.224
He goes to the Playboy Mansion,
he gets drunk, he starts using drugs.

46:50.307 --> 46:53.227
In other words, the downside of success.

46:53.310 --> 46:55.187
This is not that guy.

46:55.270 --> 46:59.233
This is the guy
who continues to just push and push

46:59.316 --> 47:00.651
and takes everyone with him.

47:00.734 --> 47:03.445
-A really idealistic individual.
-[all cheering]

47:03.529 --> 47:06.573
[Sly] See, John Avildsen
didn't like the script for Rocky II,

47:06.657 --> 47:07.991
so I ended up directing it.

47:08.075 --> 47:10.410
-I don't know.
-[reporter] How about a statement, Rocky?

47:10.494 --> 47:12.871
I don't know. I'm at a loss for words.

47:13.539 --> 47:15.123
-Rocky!
-Get back!

47:16.250 --> 47:19.670
[Quentin] One of the things that made
Rocky I and Rocky II so powerful was

47:19.753 --> 47:22.881
the way Stallone was able
to tell his story.

47:22.965 --> 47:27.636
He is channeling his life story
into both Rocky and Apollo Creed.

47:28.220 --> 47:32.182
Apollo Creed is stomping around his house
reading hate mail to his wife.

47:32.266 --> 47:35.561
That's probably Sylvester Stallone
stomping around his mansion

47:35.644 --> 47:37.896
reading Pauline Kael's
review for Paradise Alley.

47:37.980 --> 47:40.524
He's putting under the microscope
the whole concept of celebrity,

47:40.607 --> 47:42.276
to one degree or another.

47:43.861 --> 47:47.406
[Sly] The story is, in a sense,
better than the first one

47:47.489 --> 47:50.701
because it deals with
much more identifiable subjects.

47:50.784 --> 47:54.246
Rocky was a loner, now he has
a different kind of responsibility.

47:54.329 --> 47:58.375
He has the kind of responsibility
and problems that everyone in the audience

47:58.458 --> 48:02.212
who has been married or thinking
about getting married can identify with.

48:02.796 --> 48:05.716
[Wesley] I mean,
nobody thinks of Rocky as family movies,

48:05.799 --> 48:10.596
and yet, like, at their core is
this relationship between him and Adrian.

48:10.679 --> 48:15.058
The tug-of-war between having
this relationship and building this family

48:15.142 --> 48:18.437
and having this job that he has to do.

48:20.814 --> 48:23.483
[Adrian] When did you get home?
I thought you were at work.

48:23.567 --> 48:26.028
No, I… ain't at work no more.

48:26.111 --> 48:29.323
I got, uh… I got canned today.

48:30.324 --> 48:31.325
Oh.

48:32.576 --> 48:33.619
What happened?

48:33.702 --> 48:36.121
Now, do you give up your destiny

48:37.122 --> 48:39.833
for a "promise" that you made?

48:40.417 --> 48:41.501
What are you gonna do?

48:41.585 --> 48:45.839
I don't know.
I was, uh… thinking about fighting.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.925
[striking punching bag]

48:48.008 --> 48:50.302
You can be whatever you wanna be.
You don't have to fight.

48:50.385 --> 48:53.013
Well, you know, I am a fighter.

48:53.096 --> 48:55.933
Not too good, but that's what I do.

48:56.516 --> 48:59.519
Well, Rocky, you gave me your word
you wouldn't fight anymore.

49:02.272 --> 49:03.982
You see him in the lowest point.

49:04.066 --> 49:07.194
He's, like, in this
horrible little basement.

49:07.277 --> 49:08.904
He's there under a light.

49:08.987 --> 49:11.531
There's something about this guy who's…

49:11.615 --> 49:14.493
He's destined to do something,

49:14.576 --> 49:18.538
and he's being held back
for the wrong reasons.

49:18.622 --> 49:21.625
When he finally says, "I never asked you
to stop being a woman,

49:21.708 --> 49:23.961
please don't ask me
to stop being a man. I can't."

49:24.044 --> 49:26.713
He says, I love this woman,

49:26.797 --> 49:29.299
but she will not love what I will become

49:29.383 --> 49:31.969
if I don't at least try.

49:36.848 --> 49:39.351
[Arnold] Rocky II, that went
through the roof again.

49:39.434 --> 49:43.522
Doubled the amount of money
the first one made, and it just went…

49:44.022 --> 49:47.025
I mean, just bananas all over the world.

49:47.109 --> 49:49.820
So people now were really hustling him.

49:51.363 --> 49:58.078
Sly climbed the ladder, I would say,
very quickly in show business.

49:59.246 --> 50:04.793
Very few actors have the discipline
to produce and to direct.

50:04.876 --> 50:08.880
You have to think about it
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

50:08.964 --> 50:10.966
[melancholy music playing]

50:12.217 --> 50:16.847
Filmmaking is something
I understand and embrace.

50:18.306 --> 50:20.934
But it comes at a great price.

50:21.018 --> 50:25.105
When you're a truly absorbed filmmaker,

50:25.188 --> 50:28.108
act, write, and direct,
and produce and all at one time,

50:29.067 --> 50:30.485
there's no time for anything else.

50:30.569 --> 50:32.779
Just pieces and bits
and scraps for family.

50:32.863 --> 50:34.823
"What happened today?"
"Don't wanna talk about it."

50:34.906 --> 50:37.951
That's reality. When you come home,
it's almost not reality.

50:38.035 --> 50:40.495
It's a terrible conundrum.

50:45.459 --> 50:47.461
When you're younger…
"Gotta fill the house with art."

50:47.544 --> 50:49.046
"Gotta fill the house with children."

50:49.129 --> 50:52.007
"Gotta fill…" Well, now it's full.

50:52.090 --> 50:53.759
Children have moved on,

50:53.842 --> 50:56.803
and you're left
with this big, hollow, kind of…

50:57.637 --> 50:58.555
Mmm.

50:58.638 --> 51:00.640
[birds singing]

51:04.269 --> 51:08.023
It's just, it doesn't serve you anymore

51:08.106 --> 51:10.942
as a source of inspiration.

51:11.026 --> 51:15.155
I wasn't moving 'cause…
"Oh wow, I want another beautiful view."

51:15.238 --> 51:18.992
Anytime changing that paradigm,
which you become used to,

51:19.076 --> 51:24.831
it's literally to jumpstart
that process again.

51:26.750 --> 51:29.086
[Sly on tape] It's so hard to do a sequel.

51:29.169 --> 51:30.837
It's harder and harder, each one.

51:30.921 --> 51:34.674
It's always exhausting. People are
always in your ear all the time,

51:34.758 --> 51:36.676
then you get the criticism.

51:36.760 --> 51:40.680
And you say, "Is the pleasure
really gonna be worth the pain?"

51:41.223 --> 51:43.558
Every film becomes more and more difficult

51:43.642 --> 51:48.355
because you don't have
the freshness of a hungry artist.

51:50.273 --> 51:53.318
Before Rocky III, I developed fear.

51:54.027 --> 51:57.322
Maybe I'm not what I was.
Maybe it was luck.

51:57.405 --> 51:58.949
There's no passion involved.

51:59.032 --> 52:01.118
It's a good deal,
it's good money, it's good that.

52:01.201 --> 52:02.494
You start getting protected.

52:02.577 --> 52:05.413
The agencies… "keep this
and keep that and do this film."

52:05.497 --> 52:07.791
"It's safe. It's safe. It's safe."

52:07.874 --> 52:09.793
And after a while you realize,

52:09.876 --> 52:13.922
"I'm doing nothing good
because I'm listening to other people."

52:14.005 --> 52:17.050
You wake up after a few years
thinking you're a winner, but you're not.

52:17.134 --> 52:19.886
And Rocky III was an example of that.

52:19.970 --> 52:22.430
We got cars, we've got money!

52:22.514 --> 52:24.599
We got everything but the truth.

52:24.683 --> 52:26.143
What's the truth, damn it?

52:26.226 --> 52:28.061
I'm afraid! All right?

52:28.728 --> 52:31.481
You wanna hear me say it?
Wanna break me down? I'm afraid!

52:31.565 --> 52:32.858
What?

52:32.941 --> 52:37.195
You'll never have a fighter ever say,
"I'm afraid. I'm a coward."

52:37.279 --> 52:40.365
And then she turns it around.

52:40.448 --> 52:42.492
"I'm afraid too.
Nothing wrong with being afraid."

52:43.577 --> 52:46.955
[Talia] And then out of that
could come courage.

52:47.038 --> 52:50.709
Maybe the courage not to do
all those things everybody's telling…

52:50.792 --> 52:55.714
the manager's telling you to do,
the people who are handling you.

52:55.797 --> 52:59.843
Maybe courage is another thing.
What about going the distance?

53:00.886 --> 53:04.264
[Sly] I said, "Sly, get back,
start listening to yourself a little bit."

53:04.347 --> 53:06.057
"Just trust your instincts."

53:06.141 --> 53:10.645
Every decision I wanted to do,
like I wanted to use Mr. T,

53:11.479 --> 53:14.482
I wanted Survivor
to do "Eye of the Tiger,"

53:14.566 --> 53:16.443
I wanted Hulk Hogan,

53:16.526 --> 53:20.405
and everything was met with,
"That's ridiculous, that's ridiculous."

53:20.488 --> 53:22.741
I go, "I know. It is ridiculous."

53:22.824 --> 53:26.703
But it's theatrical.
It's interesting. It's different.

53:31.249 --> 53:34.211
[propulsive rock music playing]

53:37.631 --> 53:40.717
[Sly] I'm a grinder.
I just grind and grind, you know?

53:40.800 --> 53:45.013
I just try to outwork myself,
outwork my insecurities.

53:45.096 --> 53:48.350
I become indifferent
to, uh, the threat of failure

53:48.433 --> 53:50.602
because I know that no matter what,

53:50.685 --> 53:52.896
even if it's not a bona fide success,

53:52.979 --> 53:56.149
it'll be good for you
to at least continue to push yourself.

53:56.942 --> 53:59.819
90% of the journey is tumultuous and ugly.

53:59.903 --> 54:02.405
But to get to those nuggets,
you have to go through it.

54:02.489 --> 54:04.032
You may not get there,

54:04.115 --> 54:06.368
but you can be better off
than doing nothing.

54:09.663 --> 54:12.999
He keeps wanting to create.

54:13.500 --> 54:14.918
He's never sitting back.

54:15.001 --> 54:18.213
He doesn't want to say,
"I regret. I could have. I should have."

54:18.296 --> 54:20.257
"Oh, only if I did."

54:23.009 --> 54:25.762
He always knew where he wanted to be.

54:26.304 --> 54:28.098
It's not like an accident.

54:28.181 --> 54:30.600
Him becoming an action hero
was an accident.

54:32.519 --> 54:36.231
The original Rambo was a homicidal maniac.

54:36.314 --> 54:40.902
He was a vicious casualty from the war.

54:40.986 --> 54:42.862
He came back broken.

54:42.946 --> 54:47.826
There's nothing he could do to earn
his way back into America's good graces.

54:47.909 --> 54:49.953
So I said, "If I'm gonna
get involved with this,

54:50.036 --> 54:51.788
I want to rewrite the screenplay."

54:51.871 --> 54:54.207
"And I want him to go right to the edge."

54:55.417 --> 54:56.751
-[gasps]
-[grunts]

54:56.835 --> 55:00.463
Bring a certain
kind of feral ferocity to it

55:01.131 --> 55:02.424
that even shocks me.

55:02.507 --> 55:07.137
When it's like, there's just
this contorted face and rage.

55:07.220 --> 55:09.431
-[boy panting]
-[Rambo grunts]

55:09.514 --> 55:12.767
[Sly] I don't have to look far
to figure out where that came from.

55:12.851 --> 55:14.602
[suspenseful music swells]

55:14.686 --> 55:17.939
My father was Rambo, in reality.

55:18.023 --> 55:20.984
Nothing was ever settled verbally.

55:21.067 --> 55:23.945
It was usually a physical ultimatum.

55:24.904 --> 55:26.614
The way you turn a fork.

55:26.698 --> 55:28.533
If he's eating like this…

55:31.161 --> 55:32.620
you know you're gonna get it.

55:34.289 --> 55:36.541
You did not mess with this guy.

55:37.625 --> 55:41.212
That look, it was just…
It was genetic. He'd go… [grumbles]

55:44.132 --> 55:46.718
I saw an opportunity to do

55:46.801 --> 55:50.055
what I consider, like,
the first pure action film.

55:50.138 --> 55:54.142
That being that this thing
is completely done kinetically.

55:54.225 --> 55:56.102
There's just… there's so much movement

55:56.186 --> 55:58.855
that dialogue can't be handled
by the star.

55:58.938 --> 56:01.149
It has to be handled
by Trautman and other people.

56:01.232 --> 56:05.612
I mean, you are
really drawn into this loner,

56:05.695 --> 56:08.656
solitary figure who feels abandoned.

56:08.740 --> 56:11.409
Whatever he was acting was deep inside,

56:11.493 --> 56:14.412
so much deeper than what's on the page.

56:15.163 --> 56:18.708
He has a good way of writing dialogue
that's both witty and rhythmic,

56:18.792 --> 56:22.087
but also seems a bit
like improvisation to some degree.

56:22.712 --> 56:26.049
[John] Sly has a unique gift
in the words he writes.

56:26.132 --> 56:28.927
They're simple, they're true.

56:29.010 --> 56:32.514
There's an intent behind
things he writes and says.

56:33.098 --> 56:37.852
[Sly] Started really reading up on vets
and their actual words,

56:38.436 --> 56:41.272
situations, traumas.

56:42.148 --> 56:47.028
And I thought,
"Wow, if I could put a couple of beats

56:47.779 --> 56:51.825
from about 20 different guys' lives,
jumble them up…"

56:52.575 --> 56:55.870
Because Rambo hasn't spoken in years,

56:55.954 --> 56:58.748
so he's not coming out fluid.

56:58.832 --> 57:02.710
It's just this rush, this purging.

57:02.794 --> 57:06.464
So I remember
I had heard stories about this guy,

57:07.882 --> 57:11.970
about going into Saigon,
carrying a shoeshine box.

57:12.053 --> 57:13.721
"Shine, please. Shine. Shine."

57:13.805 --> 57:15.807
[Rambo] I said no. He kept asking, yeah.

57:15.890 --> 57:19.936
And Joey said, "Yeah."
And I went to get a couple beers.

57:20.019 --> 57:21.688
And the box was wired.

57:21.771 --> 57:24.732
[Sly] "I went to get a couple of beers.
The shine box was wired."

57:24.816 --> 57:26.776
"The kid opened it. Joey…"

57:26.860 --> 57:29.112
"It blew his body all over the place."

57:29.195 --> 57:31.489
"And there he is laying there
going, 'Where are my legs?'"

57:31.573 --> 57:33.575
My friend! It's all over me!

57:33.658 --> 57:36.661
Got blood and everything.
I'm trying to hold him together.

57:36.744 --> 57:39.956
I put him together,
his fucking insides keep coming out.

57:40.039 --> 57:41.791
And nobody would help!

57:42.417 --> 57:45.170
Nobody helped.
He's saying, "Please, I wanna go home…"

57:45.253 --> 57:47.964
"Where the fuck are my legs?"
You can't make that shit up.

57:49.632 --> 57:52.510
You cannot make that kind of writing up.

57:53.011 --> 57:57.849
It took me a while
to really absorb all these stories

57:57.932 --> 58:04.606
and put it in this kind of crazy monologue

58:04.689 --> 58:06.900
that was not in the screenplay.

58:06.983 --> 58:08.943
I had read David Morrell's original book.

58:09.027 --> 58:10.820
The whole point of the book is

58:10.904 --> 58:13.781
if you take this
super weapon killing machine,

58:13.865 --> 58:15.783
when the war is over,

58:15.867 --> 58:18.828
keeping that switch
turned off isn't so easy.

58:18.912 --> 58:22.457
That entire concept is
thrown away in First Blood.

58:22.540 --> 58:25.835
The changing of it
from Rambo murdering the posse

58:25.919 --> 58:27.962
to wounding the posse was Stallone's idea.

58:28.046 --> 58:31.382
[Sly] At the very end, originally,
the way it was in the script,

58:31.466 --> 58:35.678
I am shot by Colonel Trautman,

58:35.762 --> 58:37.180
and I die in slow motion.

58:37.263 --> 58:39.516
And I said to the director,
"This is not good."

58:39.599 --> 58:43.937
I don't want everyone
who was a Vietnam vet

58:44.020 --> 58:46.731
to see this film and then me shot,

58:46.814 --> 58:51.528
and realize, "Oh, so there's
no hope for me at all. None."

58:52.153 --> 58:56.324
And I left. And they were screaming
that if I don't come back,

58:56.407 --> 58:58.159
it was a breach of contract.

58:58.243 --> 58:59.536
[gunfire]

58:59.619 --> 59:01.955
[Sly] They screen it in Las Vegas.

59:02.038 --> 59:06.584
It tested so badly,
they put in the one that you see,

59:06.668 --> 59:12.173
because at that time they were losing
20,000 vets to suicide a month.

59:12.257 --> 59:14.801
I said, "I don't want
to be part of that. I don't."

59:14.884 --> 59:16.553
And I'm not going to.

59:16.636 --> 59:20.306
["Golden Brown" by the Stranglers playing]

59:22.976 --> 59:25.562
[Sly] Around the mid '80s,
I started doing Rambo.

59:25.645 --> 59:28.648
And this character
kind of started something.

59:32.610 --> 59:35.780
[Wesley] First thing that
comes to mind is physicality.

59:36.948 --> 59:41.327
I think the thing
that made Stallone a perfect '80s star

59:41.411 --> 59:45.456
was that everything
about that decade was about excess.

59:50.503 --> 59:54.632
But his body and the chaos it can make,
the carnage it can cause…

59:54.716 --> 59:58.428
People loved watching him push himself.

59:58.511 --> 59:59.596
[grunting]

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.474
[Wesley] Even when it was
almost self-parodying, people went

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:07.520
because he was
the ultra version of himself.

01:00:09.522 --> 01:00:12.859
Arnold Schwarzenegger
was his only competition.

01:00:15.403 --> 01:00:20.033
[Arnold] Sly, all of a sudden with Rambo,
he stepped into my arena.

01:00:20.116 --> 01:00:23.369
All of a sudden he was ripped,
and everyone talking about his body.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:27.957
And so that created
competition, of course.

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:31.169
At that point, we were like little kids.

01:00:31.252 --> 01:00:32.920
Who uses bigger knives?

01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:36.424
Who uses the biggest guns
and holds them in one arm and…

01:00:36.507 --> 01:00:38.926
[imitates gunfire] You know, like that.

01:00:39.010 --> 01:00:42.013
And who has more muscles,
who has more muscle definition,

01:00:42.096 --> 01:00:43.723
who has less body fat?

01:00:43.806 --> 01:00:47.185
I mean, stupid stuff
that we would be fighting over.

01:00:47.769 --> 01:00:50.229
Now we look back
and we laugh at the whole thing.

01:00:50.938 --> 01:00:54.233
We learned the effect of having muscles.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:58.363
The effect is that
people buy in twice as much.

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:03.534
This is what really gave
action movies a whole new boost.

01:01:03.618 --> 01:01:05.453
-[gunfire]
-[Arnold] A whole new push.

01:01:05.536 --> 01:01:06.954
-[gunfire]
-[engine revs]

01:01:07.872 --> 01:01:10.041
I was really committed
to making that genre

01:01:10.124 --> 01:01:11.793
something that would be lucrative

01:01:11.876 --> 01:01:15.088
and would travel
around the world, and it did.

01:01:15.171 --> 01:01:17.799
[man 1] There's something irresistible
about Sylvester Stallone.

01:01:17.882 --> 01:01:19.509
[man 2] From underdog to champion…

01:01:19.592 --> 01:01:24.222
…and have earned Stallone both
worldwide fame and a personal fortune.

01:01:24.305 --> 01:01:29.394
[man 3] Stallone knows he got where he is
because he knows what it is to make a hit.

01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:31.521
[crowd clamoring]

01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:34.816
[Arnold] I always was trailing Sly.

01:01:34.899 --> 01:01:36.234
I was always a step behind.

01:01:36.317 --> 01:01:37.985
He was always making bigger grosses.

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:40.321
And then a year later,
I made the same grosses.

01:01:40.405 --> 01:01:42.573
But by that time,
he made bigger grosses again.

01:01:42.657 --> 01:01:43.574
This is how it went.

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:45.618
And he was up and up and up and up.

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:48.830
Sly now couldn't stop, really.

01:01:48.913 --> 01:01:52.417
Not just actor or director,
but a force in Hollywood.

01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:56.421
[interviewer]
People are always telling me, your fans,

01:01:56.504 --> 01:01:59.006
it's got to be
Rocky or it's got to be Rambo.

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.467
Now, is that a frustration
for you as an actor?

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.552
It's double-edged.

01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:07.223
It's frustrating,
but being able to find not one,

01:02:07.306 --> 01:02:09.767
but a couple characters
to be so identified,

01:02:09.851 --> 01:02:11.102
so embraced,

01:02:11.185 --> 01:02:13.896
that you realize
you've accomplished something,

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.273
that's kind of unusual.

01:02:15.356 --> 01:02:17.233
I've always believed in sequels,

01:02:17.316 --> 01:02:20.903
because I think quite often
this story can't be told in two hours.

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:23.614
Why not keep going on?
If the audience likes it, why not?

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:25.116
[rock music playing]

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:28.494
[Sly] I tell people,
don't diminish sequels.

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:32.039
Because it's ten times harder
to come up with something

01:02:32.123 --> 01:02:36.169
that can keep that interest
and heat and magic going.

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:38.671
[explosions]

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:41.215
[Quentin] So, and then,
in Rocky III and Rocky IV,

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:46.304
when the character becomes less
like the real story of Sylvester Stallone

01:02:46.387 --> 01:02:48.639
and more like a comic book character.

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:50.850
And not only is he a comic book character,

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:53.478
he's seemingly fighting
comic book villains,

01:02:53.561 --> 01:02:56.272
like as if torn from
the pages of Marvel Comics.

01:02:56.355 --> 01:03:01.110
The absurdity of what the stakes are
in this movie sort of take over.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:04.572
It's about giving the audience
the ultra Stallone experience

01:03:04.655 --> 01:03:08.868
within the contained box
of the Rocky brand.

01:03:08.951 --> 01:03:10.536
[intense music builds]

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.708
[John] He's fighting,
he's directing, he's writing,

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.627
he's doing everything,

01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:21.172
which is very hard to do
in a very physical movie.

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:25.218
[Sly] Dolph Lundgren, he pulverized me.

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:26.803
[audience cheering]

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:29.180
[Sly] Later that night,
my heart started to swell,

01:03:31.098 --> 01:03:33.726
which happens when
the heart hits the chest.

01:03:35.436 --> 01:03:38.189
And then my blood pressure went up to 260.

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:42.985
And they thought I was
going to be talking to angels.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:45.071
[music peaks and fades out]

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:48.741
[wind whistling]

01:03:51.744 --> 01:03:53.830
[Sly] Next thing I know,
I'm in intensive care

01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:55.206
where I'm surrounded by nuns.

01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:57.333
And I thought, "Okay, that's curtains."

01:03:58.584 --> 01:04:01.212
Dolph Lundgren put me
in the hospital for nine days.

01:04:01.295 --> 01:04:03.589
I basically summarized it in Rocky IV,

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:05.675
like when you're beaten to the ground

01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:08.344
and you're praying someone
knocks you on the chin

01:04:08.427 --> 01:04:10.012
so you just don't suffer anymore,

01:04:10.096 --> 01:04:13.474
there's a small voice inside you
that says, "Give me one more round."

01:04:16.602 --> 01:04:19.355
[Sly] I push it. That's why
I've had five back operations.

01:04:20.022 --> 01:04:23.317
I knew. You should know after the first
back operation not to do it again.

01:04:24.235 --> 01:04:25.194
[chuckles]

01:04:25.278 --> 01:04:27.864
Probably end up with another one
'cause I know…

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:30.199
I say I'll never do that again, but I do.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:32.451
I do. I don't know why, but I do.

01:04:34.579 --> 01:04:38.332
I've always been thrown
in a world of turmoil

01:04:38.416 --> 01:04:42.336
and kind of, like, a lot of physicality.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:43.921
I guess you could call it violence.

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:46.507
[low rumbling]

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.637
[hoofbeats echoing]

01:04:59.395 --> 01:05:01.272
[horse whinnying]

01:05:01.355 --> 01:05:02.523
[echoing thud]

01:05:06.068 --> 01:05:09.864
[Sly] My father was in the army,
and he was in the cavalry.

01:05:09.947 --> 01:05:11.532
I don't know what army he was in,

01:05:11.616 --> 01:05:14.493
but they had a cavalry in World War II
along the Mexican border.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.662
So he learned to play
kinda like sandlot polo.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:18.664
So I spent a great deal of time…

01:05:18.748 --> 01:05:21.125
So I became a horseman
and I played for a while,

01:05:21.208 --> 01:05:23.210
and it is a wicked game.

01:05:23.294 --> 01:05:25.713
[Frank] Sly became
an excellent polo player.

01:05:25.796 --> 01:05:28.049
He could have been
like a six-, seven-goal player

01:05:28.132 --> 01:05:30.426
if it wasn't for
my father browbeating him.

01:05:30.509 --> 01:05:31.928
And that's why he quit polo.

01:05:33.971 --> 01:05:37.475
[Sly] I started playing again
when I was about 40.

01:05:38.392 --> 01:05:42.104
So I said, "Okay, let me do it right."
Now I've made it, Dad,

01:05:42.688 --> 01:05:47.276
I'm gonna field my father
a super team with ten-goal players,

01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.111
and we'll play against each other

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.405
in the Wellington,
the number one field in the world.

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:54.116
[melancholy rock music plays]

01:05:57.995 --> 01:06:02.041
[man] Sly Stallone shows the world
how good he is with horse and mallet,

01:06:02.124 --> 01:06:04.418
out to impress the polo elite.

01:06:08.422 --> 01:06:10.967
[Sly] So I'm out there, playing well.

01:06:11.884 --> 01:06:14.720
My father, we're going neck and neck,

01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:19.892
and I go out for a nearside.

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:24.021
My father

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:26.524
spears me in the back.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:29.944
Hit me so hard,

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:33.155
I went down.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:34.657
Entertainment Tonight is there.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:37.535
The horse walked right over,
I don't know how it didn't kill me.

01:06:37.618 --> 01:06:40.121
But I see myself getting up,
and the first thing was like…

01:06:40.204 --> 01:06:41.288
[groans]

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.460
And I think, "He just rode away."

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:51.090
Today has been maybe, probably,
the best thrill of my life.

01:06:51.173 --> 01:06:54.427
Finally have gotten to play together

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:57.054
in a quality polo game
such as we had today.

01:06:57.138 --> 01:07:01.392
If you notice, the first cheap shot,
and only cheap shot in the game,

01:07:01.475 --> 01:07:04.729
was administered
from my father… to his son.

01:07:07.815 --> 01:07:09.025
[Sly] That was it.

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:11.527
I never played polo again
from that moment on.

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:12.987
I sold everything.

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:15.531
I sold every horse, the ranch, the truck,

01:07:15.614 --> 01:07:17.283
and that was the end.

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:23.080
[waves lapping gently]

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:25.249
[birds squawking faintly]

01:07:28.586 --> 01:07:32.339
[Sly] Basically, when we're born,
we're soft clay.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:37.845
And a heavy-handed sculptor
starts to put dents in it,

01:07:37.928 --> 01:07:40.431
and that's in our mold.
That's what we are.

01:07:40.514 --> 01:07:44.060
And you just can't correct
those distortions.

01:07:44.685 --> 01:07:46.520
And that's what develops personality.

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:49.398
Not a lot of people can overcome.
It takes work.

01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:53.527
[gentle music playing]

01:08:03.287 --> 01:08:07.958
[John] I think what he was going for
in Rocky V is he wants to make sure

01:08:08.042 --> 01:08:11.921
that he never loses who he was,
where he came from.

01:08:12.004 --> 01:08:16.884
He wanted to get back to his roots, but
I don't think he did it the way he hoped.

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:23.766
[Sly] At that time,
with Rocky V, I thought,

01:08:24.558 --> 01:08:26.519
if I lost everything,

01:08:26.602 --> 01:08:30.898
could I actually go back
and start over again?

01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:34.819
Not without someone helping me.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:36.821
I realized I'm over.

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:39.490
That's why Tommy
is more important than my own family,

01:08:39.573 --> 01:08:43.035
because he's gonna bring me glory again.

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:45.704
He was almost too personal.

01:08:46.872 --> 01:08:51.085
[John] His son, Sage, he put him in it.
He wrote him in it.

01:08:52.419 --> 01:08:56.841
He wanted to give him this opportunity
that was so hard for Sly to get.

01:08:59.009 --> 01:09:01.720
[producer] How did you write the scene
in the basement with your son?

01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:04.807
He's saying, you're invested
in the boxing, but you're not seeing me.

01:09:04.890 --> 01:09:07.935
Is that something
you drew upon from your own experience?

01:09:08.018 --> 01:09:09.311
Unfortunately, yes.

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:12.398
You said I would be number one to you.
You said that and you lied.

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:14.483
You lied to me and you lied to Mom!

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:16.735
I never lied to you.

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:18.195
Tommy needed my help.

01:09:18.279 --> 01:09:19.572
So did I.

01:09:21.115 --> 01:09:24.160
[Sly] I try to take
something that actually

01:09:25.119 --> 01:09:28.289
is what I wish I had done in real life,

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:31.625
but I wasn't able to do that in reality.

01:09:32.334 --> 01:09:37.590
And so, quite often,
I would do it theatrically,

01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:39.133
magically.

01:09:40.509 --> 01:09:42.553
[Adrian] If there's something
you want to pass on,

01:09:42.636 --> 01:09:45.806
pass it on to your son, for God sakes!

01:09:45.890 --> 01:09:50.477
[Sly] Her speech, when I'm losing my son
and I'm having a nervous breakdown…

01:09:50.561 --> 01:09:54.356
"I didn't want this. I just want us
to be back to where we started."

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.025
She tears me a new one.

01:09:57.193 --> 01:09:58.736
"Save your son."

01:09:59.778 --> 01:10:01.071
A lot of that is true.

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:04.825
You know, unfortunately,
you put things before your family,

01:10:05.784 --> 01:10:12.124
and the repercussions are
quite radical and devastating.

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:15.628
I try to impart my beliefs,
my philosophies,

01:10:15.711 --> 01:10:20.466
that all the grandeur, all the fanfare,
all the international acclaim,

01:10:20.549 --> 01:10:22.843
means nothing
when you can't sleep at night,

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:27.056
when you have no one next to you,
when you don't have your flesh and blood.

01:10:27.139 --> 01:10:31.644
[Sly on tape]
Rocky V might have been just too personal.

01:10:32.436 --> 01:10:35.439
It just didn't land
with the audience at all.

01:10:36.565 --> 01:10:39.193
I used to tell people, I said,
"Don't ever watch the second half

01:10:39.276 --> 01:10:41.445
of any biography about a star."

01:10:41.528 --> 01:10:44.073
Because it's always,
"And here at the pinnacle,

01:10:44.156 --> 01:10:47.451
and he had the world in his hand.
And then…"

01:10:47.534 --> 01:10:49.870
"Well, stay tuned for the fall."

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:52.873
-[camera shutters clicking]
-[reporters] Sly! Sly!

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:57.461
If I knew I had to do
25 films my whole life, that's it,

01:11:00.005 --> 01:11:02.132
you'd choose a lot different than this.

01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:04.802
[Johnny Carson] Now all of a sudden,
you're doing a farce.

01:11:04.885 --> 01:11:06.720
That's like 180 degrees.

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:08.847
[Sly] Farce. It's a dead art form.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:13.060
Farce is not really comedy.
It's little… [chuckles]

01:11:13.143 --> 01:11:14.311
It's so fast.

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:16.897
You just really step out of your box

01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:18.732
and you do farce,

01:11:18.816 --> 01:11:20.276
you're really asking for it.

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:22.111
[chuckling] You know what I mean?

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:26.115
If you're hungry,
you always try to expand.

01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:29.868
It was natural for Sly to feel like,
"I want to get into comedies."

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:32.663
[producer]
Which one took you furthest from--

01:11:32.746 --> 01:11:33.956
-Who I am?
-[producer] Yeah.

01:11:34.039 --> 01:11:37.126
[Sly] Without a doubt. That. That.

01:11:37.209 --> 01:11:38.919
Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot.

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:42.006
[Arnold] There was a script
that was offered

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:44.383
to his agent and to my agent.

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:47.845
When I read the script, I said,
"This, I don't think I could sell,"

01:11:47.928 --> 01:11:50.055
but I'm not gonna tell them I'm out of it.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:53.434
And so they called right away, the studio.
They said, "Arnold wants the script."

01:11:53.517 --> 01:11:58.188
So Sly was going so nuts
about the fact that I want to do it,

01:11:58.272 --> 01:12:01.692
he then committed to the movie,
and then he did the movie.

01:12:01.775 --> 01:12:02.776
And the rest is history.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.904
[Wesley] He was making movies
that didn't make any sense for him

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:08.574
or didn't appear
to be making sense for him.

01:12:09.199 --> 01:12:13.162
I mean, those are movies where he is
thoroughly Sylvester Stallone in them.

01:12:13.245 --> 01:12:15.956
It's just that the environment
didn't seem right.

01:12:16.040 --> 01:12:20.586
[Sly] I can't really disassociate myself
from what I am, and I tried for a while.

01:12:20.669 --> 01:12:23.505
Doing the comedies,
even though it was kind of an adventure,

01:12:23.589 --> 01:12:25.632
it really was a wasted effort.

01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:27.634
I could've done
much better things with my time.

01:12:27.718 --> 01:12:29.511
I think people felt very disillusioned.

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:32.806
They said, "Look, why don't you do
maybe what you're meant to do?"

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:34.975
Going back to my roots, you might say.

01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:38.937
[chuckling] Then I became considered
to be, like, monosyllabic.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.898
And the less I did verbally

01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:42.441
and the more I did physically

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:44.026
was the way I was known.

01:12:44.651 --> 01:12:48.197
He really is just like
this hulking action figure

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.115
who really doesn't speak.

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:51.867
He's playing the lead in an action movie,

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:56.038
and this one is set in prison,
and another one, it's set on a train.

01:12:56.121 --> 01:13:00.167
To the point where I said,
"Okay, action, action, action."

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:02.044
"What are you doing?"

01:13:02.127 --> 01:13:04.171
[Quentin] His characters stopped
being less character

01:13:04.254 --> 01:13:06.006
and more just the leading man.

01:13:06.090 --> 01:13:07.966
And Cop Land brought us back to that.

01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:10.260
[gentle music playing]

01:13:10.344 --> 01:13:12.930
[Sly] I was not deriving
any pleasure anymore.

01:13:13.013 --> 01:13:16.934
I felt that the challenges
were that of physical challenge,

01:13:17.017 --> 01:13:20.312
and nothing to do with
any reliance upon character work,

01:13:20.396 --> 01:13:24.566
where you are
totally dependent upon how you act.

01:13:26.276 --> 01:13:28.404
And so I thought, you know,
I have to stop this.

01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:31.407
I have to try to go back
to what I enjoy more,

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:34.118
and the premise is
interacting with other actors.

01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:36.412
And then when Miramax came with Cop Land,

01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:38.497
they said, "This is going to be difficult,

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.500
because you're going
to have to completely divest yourself

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:44.420
of what you've used
for the past ten years."

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:47.214
Which is, you have to gain 30 pounds.

01:13:47.297 --> 01:13:50.884
You have to be
incredibly obsequious, fawning, shy.

01:13:51.552 --> 01:13:54.263
Time for me to turn inside out.

01:13:54.346 --> 01:13:57.641
To literally show what I have
inside on the outside.

01:13:57.724 --> 01:14:00.602
[interviewer] So this is your chance
to be taken seriously as an actor?

01:14:00.686 --> 01:14:05.190
Well, I would like to be able
to know that I had an opportunity

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:08.152
to work with great actors,
and see if I could hold my own.

01:14:08.235 --> 01:14:10.779
-Excuse me.
-Moe, I apologize. He just walked in.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:12.364
I'm sorry for rushing in like this.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.616
[Sly] When I do the scene with De Niro,

01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:16.618
been waiting for this scene for 20 years.

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:20.706
Everyone's going, "Oh, this is gonna be
a bloodbath. This is gonna be terrible."

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:23.750
What is this? You came to me, to my…

01:14:23.834 --> 01:14:25.419
[Sly] And I'm doing my lines,

01:14:25.502 --> 01:14:29.590
and I feel that Bobby
is not giving me enough "Bobby."

01:14:29.673 --> 01:14:32.468
I really wanted him
to lay into me, the character.

01:14:33.218 --> 01:14:36.972
I really want him
to hit me hard as I need to be hit

01:14:37.055 --> 01:14:39.683
for me to feel as though I'm…

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:42.436
playing the character properly.

01:14:42.519 --> 01:14:45.355
I need to walk
out of this room demolished.

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:51.528
I said, "I'm gonna go off the page.
I'm going to try to get under his skin."

01:14:51.612 --> 01:14:54.281
So we're doing the scene,
and we get to the final line.

01:14:54.364 --> 01:14:55.908
"I can't help you anymore."

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:58.076
Now, I know that he's thinking,

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.038
"Okay, that's a wrap."
I go, "Wait, whoa, wait a minute."

01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:05.083
"You said if I needed help,
you would be here."

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:06.168
"I could come up here…"

01:15:06.251 --> 01:15:08.504
He goes, "Hey, it's over.
Everything's over."

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:11.215
"No, but it's not over.
I did what you wanted me to do."

01:15:11.298 --> 01:15:13.050
"I did exactly what you asked."

01:15:13.133 --> 01:15:15.260
"Now you're saying
it doesn't matter anymore?"

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:17.429
"Just give me a chance.
Listen, hear me out."

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.640
He goes, "Shut-- You deaf fuck!"

01:15:19.723 --> 01:15:21.266
Listen to me, you deaf fuck.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.560
I offered you a chance
when we could've done something.

01:15:23.644 --> 01:15:26.772
I offered you a chance
to be a cop, and you blew it!

01:15:26.855 --> 01:15:29.233
[claps] Fuck yeah! Thank you, Bobby.

01:15:32.528 --> 01:15:34.071
But that bombed.

01:15:34.154 --> 01:15:35.364
That didn't do well.

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:40.285
[Quentin] He's carrying the movie, but
through this physicality as a character.

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.871
Everybody else has the fireworks,
everybody else has big speeches.

01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:47.876
It's all down to the minutiae of…
the ephemera of his characterization.

01:15:49.294 --> 01:15:53.215
[Wesley] Something about
how restrained Stallone is being…

01:15:53.298 --> 01:15:56.301
He is playing something deep in here.

01:15:57.761 --> 01:16:02.015
I wish that James Mangold had
more faith in what Stallone was doing,

01:16:02.099 --> 01:16:05.018
because that sadness
is there for a reason.

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:07.646
I think that the movie
kind of lets him down.

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:10.899
[John] I don't think he got
the credit he deserved for that film.

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:12.859
That was frustrating to him.

01:16:12.943 --> 01:16:15.195
[melancholy music playing]

01:16:15.279 --> 01:16:18.115
[Sly] I started to get
disenchanted with myself.

01:16:18.198 --> 01:16:23.620
I go, "Well, maybe that's
a natural migration into obsolescence."

01:16:23.704 --> 01:16:25.539
Maybe that's the journey. You know?

01:16:25.622 --> 01:16:29.418
Everyone can't be, you know,
at the top of their game forever.

01:16:31.712 --> 01:16:34.172
I realized that at that point,

01:16:34.256 --> 01:16:36.383
it's important to stay in your own lane,

01:16:36.466 --> 01:16:38.218
to become a specialist.

01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:40.887
Like an artist.

01:16:40.971 --> 01:16:43.348
You have that style, you're a Rothko,

01:16:43.432 --> 01:16:46.226
and no one can do
Rothko better than Rothko.

01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:51.440
Everyone goes,
"Oh, we can do the full spectrum."

01:16:51.523 --> 01:16:53.317
"We can be anything." No, you can't.

01:16:54.067 --> 01:16:57.321
You have certain manifest
weaknesses and great strengths.

01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:59.448
And I said, focus on the strengths.

01:16:59.531 --> 01:17:02.534
Don't sit there and try to do Shakespeare
when you look like me.

01:17:03.535 --> 01:17:07.623
[Wesley] He has these two characters
he can always go back to,

01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:11.084
to get whatever adoration
or sense of legitimacy

01:17:11.168 --> 01:17:12.419
that he feels he's lost.

01:17:12.502 --> 01:17:14.921
He can get that back
anytime he plays Rocky

01:17:15.005 --> 01:17:16.340
and anytime he plays Rambo.

01:17:16.423 --> 01:17:18.884
Those characters are
always going to be there for him.

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:21.803
And it's a place
he can always go back to to reset.

01:17:21.887 --> 01:17:24.640
[Sly] In a film like Rocky VI,

01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:29.853
which, to me, is my proudest
accomplishment in my entire career,

01:17:29.936 --> 01:17:33.357
because we're following Rocky V,

01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.941
it's 19 years later.

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:40.489
Rocky has missed an entire generation
that's grown up, have no idea who he is.

01:17:40.572 --> 01:17:44.951
That character had meant so much
to myself and so many other people,

01:17:45.035 --> 01:17:48.622
and to leave it on that dour note

01:17:48.705 --> 01:17:49.956
just killed me.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:54.044
So I spent endless hours
writing, rewriting,

01:17:54.127 --> 01:17:56.254
writing, writing, writing Rocky Balboa.

01:17:56.338 --> 01:17:59.633
Producer goes, "Over our dead body.
Told you before, it'll never happen."

01:17:59.716 --> 01:18:00.967
Heads of studios.

01:18:01.051 --> 01:18:04.763
They rejected, rejected, rejected.
"Rocky's done and you're done."

01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:07.516
I mean, it was brutal.
Nobody wanted to make it.

01:18:07.599 --> 01:18:10.602
They laughed. You know?
Even my wife said, "Please don't."

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:13.563
But she didn't quite understand
what I was going for.

01:18:13.647 --> 01:18:15.315
I wasn't doing a boxing movie.

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:21.029
I was doing a movie about
how to deal with moving on

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:24.157
when the things
you love the most have left you.

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:28.245
And I use it symbolically
with Adrian being gone,

01:18:28.328 --> 01:18:31.331
that you had that horrible
feeling in your stomach

01:18:31.415 --> 01:18:33.875
that your life has been so incomplete,

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:36.503
and you can't go on without…

01:18:36.586 --> 01:18:39.673
You just never achieved
what you thought you should've achieved.

01:18:39.756 --> 01:18:41.133
You never loved her enough.

01:18:41.216 --> 01:18:44.594
You never gave people the respect,
you never said thank you.

01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:47.764
You talked about
this stuff in the basement,

01:18:49.182 --> 01:18:50.559
which is regret.

01:18:51.393 --> 01:18:55.772
And I go, "Man, I have a lot of that."
And this is what the movie's about.

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:59.651
He's fighting to purge himself of pain,

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:01.319
of the past.

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:05.031
He says, quote, "I want to replace
old pain with new pain."

01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:07.284
-Meaning, I want to get hit.
-[strikes palm]

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:11.621
And maybe I'll forget
about the stuff in the basement.

01:19:12.205 --> 01:19:15.375
[Sly on tape] I was talking to my son
what the future was all about.

01:19:16.626 --> 01:19:20.380
And I thought, life is undefeated.
You can't beat it.

01:19:21.381 --> 01:19:23.467
You just have to go on the defense.

01:19:26.386 --> 01:19:30.849
That inspired the line,
"No one punches harder than life."

01:19:32.350 --> 01:19:36.480
I have a habit of… adding words.

01:19:36.563 --> 01:19:37.647
We're doing the scene,

01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:40.609
I would get three-quarters
of the way through, and they'd go,

01:19:40.692 --> 01:19:43.653
"Why did you add that word?
It was okay before."

01:19:43.737 --> 01:19:47.616
This is the one take where it was
consistent all the way through.

01:19:47.699 --> 01:19:48.992
It's simple.

01:19:49.075 --> 01:19:52.496
The message is as plain as can be.

01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:55.832
And it isn't, like, hysterical.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:58.001
But you used to fit right here.

01:19:58.835 --> 01:20:01.129
I'd hold you up and say to your mother,

01:20:01.213 --> 01:20:03.840
"This kid's going to be
the best kid in the world."

01:20:03.924 --> 01:20:06.802
"This kid's going to be somebody better
than anybody ever knew."

01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:09.429
You see that he's talking from love.

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:10.889
He loves this kid.

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:13.433
The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows.

01:20:13.517 --> 01:20:15.602
It's a very mean and nasty place.

01:20:15.685 --> 01:20:17.479
And I don't care how tough you are,

01:20:17.562 --> 01:20:19.147
it will beat you to your knees

01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:21.650
and keep you there permanently
if you let it.

01:20:21.733 --> 01:20:23.735
You, me, or nobody

01:20:23.819 --> 01:20:25.862
is going to hit as hard as life.

01:20:25.946 --> 01:20:27.989
But it ain't about how hard you hit.

01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:31.701
It's about how hard you can get hit
and keep moving forward.

01:20:31.785 --> 01:20:34.663
How much you can take
and keep moving forward.

01:20:38.750 --> 01:20:41.628
[Sly] I've always wanted to take Rocky I

01:20:41.711 --> 01:20:43.839
and this one and put it together

01:20:43.922 --> 01:20:46.049
and show how fast life goes by.

01:20:47.133 --> 01:20:51.888
Life is addition up until age 40,
and after that it's subtraction.

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:53.974
Your children are moving out,

01:20:54.057 --> 01:20:58.228
your friends are moving on,
some dying, job is gone.

01:20:58.854 --> 01:20:59.729
Gone.

01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:00.981
It's loss.

01:21:02.482 --> 01:21:04.442
[melancholy music playing]

01:21:09.781 --> 01:21:11.825
[Sly] There's a line in the movie that…

01:21:11.908 --> 01:21:15.245
"I'm so glad he's born
because now I can live through your eyes."

01:21:15.328 --> 01:21:18.331
That, I think, is what fathers
look to their children for.

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:21.001
It's an extension of…
It's a slice of immortality.

01:21:21.084 --> 01:21:23.336
As long as he's alive,
your memory will always be alive.

01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.922
That you did something right.
I mean, you hope for that.

01:21:36.433 --> 01:21:38.435
[birds singing]

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:42.188
[interviewer]
You have a successful Rocky series

01:21:42.272 --> 01:21:44.190
and you have a successful Rambo series,

01:21:44.274 --> 01:21:47.152
but after all these successes,
at some point people say to you,

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:50.447
"Well, maybe you're
too old to play these parts."

01:21:50.530 --> 01:21:53.450
And all of a sudden your agent says,
"Maybe we can't help you."

01:21:53.533 --> 01:21:55.619
[Sly] That fourth crossroad.

01:21:55.702 --> 01:21:59.414
Okay, do I listen to them,
or how do you feel?

01:21:59.497 --> 01:22:00.999
Do you feel still competitive?

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:04.836
Is there, as Rocky would say,
stuff in the basement?

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.548
And I go, "Yeah, but I just
have to do it age-appropriate."

01:22:08.632 --> 01:22:11.051
That's when I came up
with The Expendables.

01:22:13.219 --> 01:22:16.598
I went to this rock and roll revival.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.477
I'm telling my wife,
"God, these guys are so great."

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:24.022
And my wife is looking at me.
I said, "It's gonna get better."

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:25.190
Boom.

01:22:25.273 --> 01:22:30.278
Out comes this guy, Dockers,
baggy-ass canvas-type pants

01:22:30.362 --> 01:22:34.115
that he's been sitting on so long,
the back looks like a fucking accordion.

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:37.160
Holy shit, this is genius.

01:22:37.243 --> 01:22:41.623
The place is sold out.
Everyone on stage is… done.

01:22:41.706 --> 01:22:44.000
But the fact that thousands of people came

01:22:44.084 --> 01:22:48.380
to see this collection of former greats,

01:22:48.463 --> 01:22:50.966
I said, "There's gotta be something here."

01:22:51.049 --> 01:22:53.510
I said, "Let me start doing that
with action guys."

01:22:53.593 --> 01:22:55.136
[dramatic music playing]

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:58.473
[Sly] And that… made it an event.

01:23:00.058 --> 01:23:02.602
As opposed to,
"Stallone in The Expendable,

01:23:02.686 --> 01:23:03.645
is the expendable."

01:23:03.728 --> 01:23:08.525
No, he's part of this once-great group.

01:23:08.608 --> 01:23:13.738
"Shit. Just out of morbid curiosity,
I've got to see this."

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:18.743
[Arnold] What a great concept,
to have all these action heroes

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:21.538
from the '80s, the '90s, 2000s,

01:23:21.621 --> 01:23:23.873
everyone together, thrown into one pot.

01:23:26.501 --> 01:23:29.087
[Wesley] There's something
about Stallone at this age,

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:31.297
accepting his experience,

01:23:31.381 --> 01:23:33.216
that he's survived this long.

01:23:33.299 --> 01:23:37.303
I mean, I don't know if he should… I mean,
should he still be alive? I don't know.

01:23:39.097 --> 01:23:41.933
[Arnold] It's not uncommon
for an action hero

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:44.436
to get injured on the set.

01:23:44.519 --> 01:23:48.440
But I think it is clear
that Sly drove it to the extreme.

01:23:49.441 --> 01:23:50.817
I thought it was too much.

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:54.779
[Sly] Having the family
there the whole time.

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.990
It was hard on them

01:23:57.073 --> 01:24:00.660
because I was so stressed and beat up

01:24:00.744 --> 01:24:03.747
and bronchitis and thrush
and fractured neck.

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:05.623
It was just on and on and on and on.

01:24:05.707 --> 01:24:07.876
So, they were not enjoying this.

01:24:08.418 --> 01:24:10.503
[woman] He's been working nights.
Hasn't slept at all.

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:12.255
Now he's gotta work all night again.

01:24:12.338 --> 01:24:15.592
He's gotta just get home
and be operated on right away.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:20.388
Truthfully, I never fully recovered
from Expendables 1.

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:24.726
It did such a number on my body,
I've never been the same.

01:24:24.809 --> 01:24:26.061
Never.

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:28.229
And you go, "Was it really worth it?"

01:24:28.313 --> 01:24:30.857
Are you doing this for people's approval?

01:24:31.858 --> 01:24:36.488
Really? That's almost like a child needing
a pat on the head by their father.

01:24:36.571 --> 01:24:38.114
That's constant encouragement.

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:39.199
But it's true.

01:24:42.702 --> 01:24:44.662
[projector whirring]

01:24:44.746 --> 01:24:48.291
[producer] This film has stayed with you
for a long time. Why is that?

01:24:49.375 --> 01:24:52.504
[Sly] This film here
reminds me of my father.

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:57.383
[man in film] You never called me.
You never said my name.

01:24:58.968 --> 01:25:00.970
I'd have walked, I'd have crawled.

01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:03.014
I'd have done anything.

01:25:04.766 --> 01:25:08.311
It's not my fault. I won't be blamed!

01:25:11.064 --> 01:25:15.985
This is the most… extraordinary film

01:25:16.069 --> 01:25:17.946
about zeroing in

01:25:18.029 --> 01:25:23.535
on what's really at the core of need,

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:24.994
human need.

01:25:26.704 --> 01:25:29.415
Love. Requited love.

01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:31.709
You're not mine!

01:25:33.002 --> 01:25:34.587
We're not connected!

01:25:35.171 --> 01:25:36.339
I deny you!

01:25:37.423 --> 01:25:41.219
None of you will get my kingdom.
I leave you nothing and I wish you plague!

01:25:41.302 --> 01:25:44.097
May all your children breech and die!

01:25:45.974 --> 01:25:47.892
[Sly] When you've been rejected,

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:52.522
love is a powerful, powerful agent.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:57.402
I wasn't given a shot, really.

01:25:57.485 --> 01:26:00.238
In my childhood, everything was…

01:26:01.489 --> 01:26:02.532
Hm.

01:26:02.615 --> 01:26:04.909
It was not good.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:08.413
So in my world, the Stallone film world,

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:12.709
what wouldn't normally happen can happen.

01:26:13.585 --> 01:26:17.046
That this loser fighter
is gonna become a winner.

01:26:20.216 --> 01:26:25.221
I was blessed with an ability
to deflect this bitterness

01:26:25.305 --> 01:26:27.432
into what I wish…

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:29.893
what I wish had happened.

01:26:29.976 --> 01:26:33.354
I wish I had a father like Rocky.

01:26:33.438 --> 01:26:35.982
You can sit there
and actually film yourself. Look at this.

01:26:36.065 --> 01:26:37.358
[Sly hums cheerful tune]

01:26:37.442 --> 01:26:39.485
-There you go.
-Isn't that amazing?

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:42.071
I said, "Dad's dying. He's going to die."

01:26:42.155 --> 01:26:44.365
"And you haven't
talked to him in a long, long time."

01:26:44.449 --> 01:26:46.075
So, love you.

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:47.452
[kisses]

01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:48.536
You take care.

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:50.246
-[kisses] Yes.
-And here's Frank.

01:26:50.330 --> 01:26:55.501
I arranged for him to be with my father
a few weeks before he died.

01:26:55.585 --> 01:26:56.961
[Frank Sr.] Come here, son.

01:26:57.754 --> 01:27:01.174
[tearfully] Oh!
This is the best day of my life.

01:27:01.257 --> 01:27:02.550
[Sly] I love you, Daddy.

01:27:02.634 --> 01:27:03.843
[both crying]

01:27:08.014 --> 01:27:09.599
[Sly] He's on his deathbed.

01:27:09.682 --> 01:27:11.392
He goes, "You know, Sly."

01:27:11.476 --> 01:27:12.852
I go, "Yeah, Dad?" He goes…

01:27:14.187 --> 01:27:17.774
"You should learn
to love and forgive people."

01:27:19.359 --> 01:27:20.360
I said, "Really?"

01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:22.528
"That just come to you now

01:27:22.612 --> 01:27:25.365
as the fucking angels
are about to whisper in your ear?"

01:27:25.448 --> 01:27:28.326
He goes, "Yeah, you should learn…"
He starts laughing.

01:27:28.409 --> 01:27:30.912
I said, "You bastard." What are you…

01:27:30.995 --> 01:27:33.164
Now you're telling me to be kind?

01:27:33.248 --> 01:27:36.376
Like, you just had an epiphany
on the way out?

01:27:36.459 --> 01:27:38.211
He goes, "Yeah, I did."

01:27:38.294 --> 01:27:40.463
"Just remember those words,
you little bastard."

01:27:40.546 --> 01:27:41.381
I went, "Thank you."

01:27:41.464 --> 01:27:43.800
[melancholy music playing]

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:58.439
[Sly] My children…
Well, I get really emotional about it.

01:28:00.024 --> 01:28:01.651
There's always that regret.

01:28:03.444 --> 01:28:04.612
I…

01:28:06.155 --> 01:28:08.074
could have learned so much more

01:28:09.075 --> 01:28:12.704
if I hadn't been so self-absorbed

01:28:12.787 --> 01:28:16.791
and dealing with other people.

01:28:16.874 --> 01:28:21.838
You think about
what you should have done at this age.

01:28:22.797 --> 01:28:25.383
And now they're this age.

01:28:25.466 --> 01:28:26.759
What did I mess up on?

01:28:26.843 --> 01:28:29.929
I'm there making a stupid movie

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:32.724
instead of making their life.

01:28:34.559 --> 01:28:37.603
They make me happy.
They make me really sad.

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:41.774
They bring me emotion.

01:28:46.863 --> 01:28:48.698
I had to almost lose it

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:51.242
to respect it.

01:28:54.579 --> 01:28:56.706
So the act of loving my children now,

01:28:56.789 --> 01:29:01.586
actually taking such stock
and value of the time…

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:02.712
Jesus.

01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:07.967
It's so… callous and brutal.

01:29:08.051 --> 01:29:12.263
And it sneaks up on you, and you go,
"Okay, time to check out, Sly."

01:29:12.347 --> 01:29:13.765
"Whoa! I was just born!"

01:29:13.848 --> 01:29:15.600
"No. No."

01:29:15.683 --> 01:29:19.771
Now it's a matter of,
I wanna be the juggler.

01:29:19.854 --> 01:29:22.106
A really good juggler. You know, just…

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:25.902
family, life, children, wife, you know?

01:29:25.985 --> 01:29:28.404
Art, just everything. Just… in balance.

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.407
[tape player clicks]

01:29:31.491 --> 01:29:33.743
[Sly on tape] There's an old saying that

01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:38.414
the child becomes the father to the man.

01:29:38.498 --> 01:29:41.042
And the children I create,
Rocky and Rambo,

01:29:41.125 --> 01:29:43.294
have now become my father.

01:29:43.961 --> 01:29:46.005
They're taking care of me.

01:29:46.089 --> 01:29:49.842
The beauty of being able to play those two

01:29:50.593 --> 01:29:53.805
is, literally, that's
the entire spectrum of life.

01:29:53.888 --> 01:29:55.765
The disenfranchised,

01:29:55.848 --> 01:29:59.227
the one that's just friendless and lonely,

01:29:59.310 --> 01:30:02.271
and the one here that embraces everything,

01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:06.359
loves humanity, and is loved by humanity.

01:30:06.442 --> 01:30:08.528
And I relate so well to both of them.

01:30:10.780 --> 01:30:13.157
[Rambo] I lived in a world of death.

01:30:14.826 --> 01:30:17.161
I tried to come home.

01:30:18.871 --> 01:30:21.290
[Sly] Rambo has been mortally wounded,

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:26.129
and now he's returned home
to sit in his father's rocking chair.

01:30:26.212 --> 01:30:29.215
He sees his life ebbing before him.

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.053
I started regretting the idea

01:30:34.971 --> 01:30:38.349
that this is the way
this warrior goes out.

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:41.477
When they pull away,

01:30:41.561 --> 01:30:43.479
the chair was still.

01:30:44.272 --> 01:30:50.194
I had them start to CGI
that the chair was still rocking slightly.

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:51.863
So, he's still alive.

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:54.031
But the way I shot it, it wasn't.

01:30:54.115 --> 01:30:58.870
And I so believe
that we don't see our heroes

01:30:59.745 --> 01:31:02.790
die before our eyes.

01:31:02.874 --> 01:31:08.463
That there's always
some mystical quality about them.

01:31:10.256 --> 01:31:14.469
I realized with Rambo,
he'll never have home.

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:16.804
That's the tragedy of that character.

01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:20.141
[emotional music playing]

01:31:21.767 --> 01:31:23.394
[Sly] Without home,

01:31:23.936 --> 01:31:28.774
without that family,
without the love of wife or children,

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:32.069
what's this?

01:31:33.196 --> 01:31:35.907
These are just pictures,

01:31:36.657 --> 01:31:41.412
film images
of something that never existed.

01:31:42.246 --> 01:31:43.915
This is not life.

01:31:45.249 --> 01:31:47.126
This is artwork.

01:31:47.210 --> 01:31:50.254
This is configurations of imagination.

01:31:51.547 --> 01:31:52.882
That's real.

01:31:53.966 --> 01:31:57.970
That lives and breathes
and dies and bleeds.

01:31:58.054 --> 01:31:59.847
And you better take care of that.

01:32:01.265 --> 01:32:04.101
[emotional music swells]

01:32:14.195 --> 01:32:15.947
[Sly] But if you have no guidance,

01:32:16.030 --> 01:32:19.534
and you have to go through life
devalued every inch of the way,

01:32:19.617 --> 01:32:21.118
that leaves a hole.

01:32:22.453 --> 01:32:24.705
And that hole is never filled.

01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:34.215
What I can do
is fill it through imagination.

01:32:36.842 --> 01:32:39.804
I want to somehow show hope.

01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:44.141
I'm in the hope business,

01:32:44.225 --> 01:32:46.769
and I just hate sad endings. Sorry.

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:49.105
Shoot me.

01:32:56.487 --> 01:32:57.822
