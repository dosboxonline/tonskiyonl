51:25.169 --> 51:29.825
it is impossible for me
to not consider our relationship

51:29.869 --> 51:33.002
as I consider my future.

51:34.917 --> 51:39.183
Discoveryis my home
and my family...

51:41.185 --> 51:43.796
You...

51:43.839 --> 51:47.016
are also my home.

51:47.060 --> 51:48.931
My family.

51:50.281 --> 51:54.763
And somehow, so much more.

51:58.637 --> 52:02.423
I am going to accept
President Rillak's offer.

52:04.382 --> 52:09.430
I want to be with you, always.

52:09.474 --> 52:14.566
I had dared to hope that
you would make such a decision.

52:16.089 --> 52:18.439
If I may,

52:18.483 --> 52:20.485
I do believe it would
be only logical,

52:20.528 --> 52:23.792
given this development,
for us to codify

52:23.836 --> 52:28.493
our mutual commitment
in a more official capacity.

52:29.450 --> 52:31.278
Oh.

52:33.237 --> 52:36.196
T'Rina...

52:36.240 --> 52:40.200
Are you asking me to marry you?

52:40.244 --> 52:44.291
I believe that is the language
some cultures use for it.

52:47.076 --> 52:48.295
[exhales]

52:48.339 --> 52:50.079
Oh.

52:55.650 --> 52:56.999
[doors whoosh open]

52:57.043 --> 52:58.740
CULBER:
Captain, are you all right?

52:58.784 --> 53:00.742
Oh, I'm-I'm fine.
I was just talking to Tilly.

53:00.786 --> 53:02.788
I haven't had
a chance to change.

53:03.745 --> 53:06.313
What did we find out?

53:06.357 --> 53:08.228
Well, something, uh,
pretty fascinating, really.

53:08.272 --> 53:10.926
We were able to download
the last 15 teraquads

53:10.970 --> 53:13.407
of data from
his ocular processing unit,

53:13.451 --> 53:16.845
and he got a pretty good look
at the diary.

53:18.630 --> 53:20.327
BURNHAM:
Zora, can you slow that down?

53:20.371 --> 53:21.850
ZORA:
Of course, Captain.

53:31.643 --> 53:33.079
Freeze on that last image.

53:35.560 --> 53:37.736
Can you zoom in on that?

53:38.780 --> 53:40.086
Twin moons.

53:40.129 --> 53:42.175
It's in the Vileen system.

53:48.486 --> 53:51.184
I need to talk to Kovich.

53:54.013 --> 53:56.058
[thunder rumbling]

53:57.625 --> 54:00.149
Dr. Kovich.

54:00.193 --> 54:03.240
You're looking for a planet
with twin moons.

54:03.283 --> 54:05.546
This is the wrong planet.

54:07.026 --> 54:09.463
I know about the distress call,
Dr. Kovich.

54:09.507 --> 54:12.031
I've seen the Romulan's diary.

54:12.074 --> 54:13.293
Isn't that enough
to convince you

54:13.337 --> 54:14.686
to tell me what it all means?

54:14.729 --> 54:17.297
Your tenacity
is admirable, Captain,

54:17.341 --> 54:19.952
but that information
remains classified.

54:19.995 --> 54:21.258
How many more lives
are you willing to risk

54:21.301 --> 54:22.781
to keep it that way?

54:24.304 --> 54:25.914
Respectfully, sir,

54:25.958 --> 54:28.221
I can't keep doing
my mission in the dark.

54:28.265 --> 54:31.137
Then you'll be relieved to know
it's no longer your mission.

54:31.180 --> 54:33.313
This Red Directive
is bigger than me.

54:33.357 --> 54:36.403
It's been classified
for centuries.

54:36.447 --> 54:39.058
It's more important
than you can imagine.

54:39.101 --> 54:41.365
I need to send a team.

54:41.408 --> 54:44.063
You already have one.

54:46.761 --> 54:48.328
So you can keep searching holos

54:48.372 --> 54:50.243
of every two-moon system
in the Federation databases,

54:50.287 --> 54:53.028
and it might take you
a few hundred years,

54:53.072 --> 54:55.509
or you can read me in.

54:55.553 --> 54:57.381
What's it gonna be?

55:01.994 --> 55:06.520
Reaching out to Lieutenant Tilly
was smart.

55:06.564 --> 55:11.264
Perhaps it's best Admiral Vance
couldn't stop her in time.

55:12.787 --> 55:16.269
Computer, deactivate hologram.

55:26.323 --> 55:30.065
The Romulan's name
was Dr. Vellek.

55:30.109 --> 55:33.721
One of the greatest scientists
of his day.

55:33.765 --> 55:35.332
He was present

55:35.375 --> 55:39.510
when a Starfleet captain,
Jean-Luc Picard,

55:39.553 --> 55:43.731
found a message left
by a race of ancient beings.

55:44.950 --> 55:49.084
We've been calling them
the Progenitors.

55:49.128 --> 55:52.784
They created life as we know it.

55:53.785 --> 55:56.527
Life as in...

55:56.570 --> 55:57.789
You.

55:57.832 --> 56:00.661
Me. Saru.

56:00.705 --> 56:04.535
Every humanoid species
in the galaxy.

56:04.578 --> 56:09.453
A few thousand years ago,
we'd have called them gods.

56:09.496 --> 56:13.370
Somehow, Dr. Vellek
found their technology.

56:13.413 --> 56:17.461
Whatever it was they used
to design life itself.

56:17.504 --> 56:19.593
When he disappeared
800 years ago,

56:19.637 --> 56:21.943
its location was lost with him.

56:21.987 --> 56:27.035
Now, Moll and L'ak know
where it is

56:27.079 --> 56:32.258
or the diary is the first piece
of the puzzle.

56:32.301 --> 56:36.262
Either way, we have
to find it before they do.

56:36.305 --> 56:39.700
In the wrong hands,
I-I can only imagine

56:39.744 --> 56:42.660
how a technology this powerful
might be used.

56:44.618 --> 56:46.446
There is a system in the outer
sector

56:46.490 --> 56:48.013
of the Beta Quadrant, Vileen.

56:48.056 --> 56:50.015
It doesn't have a planet
with two moons,

56:50.058 --> 56:53.061
but one of its worlds, Lyrek,
has three moons,

56:53.105 --> 56:56.151
two of which move
in perfect sync.

56:56.195 --> 56:59.285
Twin moons? It's on Lyrek.

56:59.328 --> 57:00.591
Yes, sir.

57:00.634 --> 57:02.984
Well, Captain,

57:03.028 --> 57:07.206
the greatest treasure in
the known galaxy is out there.

57:11.863 --> 57:14.387
What are you waiting for?

57:17.172 --> 57:18.609
Let's fly.

57:34.363 --> 57:37.236
BURNHAM:
We're on a search for one of
the greatest powers ever known.

57:37.279 --> 57:40.195
STAMETS:
The technology, it could have

57:40.239 --> 57:42.502
incredible applications.

57:42.546 --> 57:44.199
CULBER:
Protecting it...

57:44.243 --> 57:46.767
-[roaring]
-What was that?

57:46.811 --> 57:48.334
...nothing's more important.

57:48.813 --> 57:50.815
Power of creation, here we come.

57:50.858 --> 57:54.340
We are gonna find
the Progenitors' tech.

57:56.037 --> 57:59.127
-Could have just said hello.
-You could have just
left us the hell alone.

57:59.171 --> 58:01.347
It could be a suicide mission.

58:01.390 --> 58:03.523
BURNHAM:
I'm afraid a lot.

58:03.567 --> 58:05.743
Change can be hard.

58:06.787 --> 58:09.398
We're on this quest to find
the thing that created us.

58:11.096 --> 58:12.750
It's kind of beautiful,
in a twisted sort of way.

58:14.665 --> 58:17.406
We're only gonna get one
shot at this. Make it count.

58:17.450 --> 58:19.626
-This is insane.
-Here we go.

58:19.670 --> 58:21.889
One last mission to say goodbye.

58:24.022 --> 58:25.545
BOOK: What do you think
happens when we finally

58:25.589 --> 58:26.938
put this thing together?

58:26.981 --> 58:28.243
BURNHAM:
I don't know.

58:30.507 --> 58:34.507
But I can't wait to find out.
