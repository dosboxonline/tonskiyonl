03:36.954 --> 03:38.740
A very big planet.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.655
Trill has a surface area

03:40.698 --> 03:42.744
of 500 million
square kilometers.

03:42.787 --> 03:45.660
So, the question is,
where in all that area

03:45.703 --> 03:48.097
are we gonna find our next clue?

03:48.140 --> 03:50.055
Commander Stamets has been
working on the tricorder

03:50.099 --> 03:52.493
recovered from the Romulan ship.
No help yet,

03:52.536 --> 03:55.844
and we've been analyzing the
poem from Lyrek and...

03:55.887 --> 03:57.846
We used a decryption algorithm

03:57.889 --> 04:01.110
to try and find any coded
messages in the language syntax.

04:01.153 --> 04:03.852
Nothing there,
but we did find this

04:03.895 --> 04:05.984
on the metal piece
you recovered.

04:06.028 --> 04:08.813
We realized that these markings
are consistent

04:08.857 --> 04:11.468
with the patterns
of Trill facial spots.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.296
Which are unique
to the individual.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.559
As unique as fingerprints
in humans

04:15.603 --> 04:18.127
or dorsal ridges in Saurians.

04:18.170 --> 04:21.348
We asked Zora to try to locate
a possible match, so... Zora?

04:21.391 --> 04:23.393
ZORA:
This is Jinaal Bix.

04:23.437 --> 04:25.569
His facial markings
correspond precisely

04:25.613 --> 04:27.484
with the markings on the clue
retrieved from Lyrek.

04:27.528 --> 04:29.486
He lived 800 years ago,

04:29.530 --> 04:31.227
at the same time
as the Romulan scientist.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.361
[chuckles] So, this clue
points to a person.

04:34.404 --> 04:36.580
ADIRA:
But Jinaal wasn't
your average Trill,

04:36.624 --> 04:39.148
I think he was a symbiont host.

04:39.191 --> 04:41.150
It would be

04:41.193 --> 04:43.631
unusual for one
to live 800 years,

04:43.674 --> 04:45.850
but not completely unheard of.

04:45.894 --> 04:47.243
You think it could
still be alive?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.375
ADIRA:
If so, then its

04:48.418 --> 04:49.506
current host would have

04:49.550 --> 04:51.159
all the memories of Jinaal Bix,

04:51.203 --> 04:52.944
and we'd be able to ask them
a lot of questions.

04:52.988 --> 04:54.250
And the Guardians
should have records

04:54.294 --> 04:55.556
to help us find
the current host.

04:55.599 --> 04:57.297

Welcome aboard, Commander.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.192
At your service, Captain.

05:23.235 --> 05:26.151
I trust your quarters
are satisfactory.

05:26.195 --> 05:28.806
They're fine. A little smaller
than I'm used to, but,

05:28.850 --> 05:31.635
uh, then again,
I'm used to having your job.

05:35.335 --> 05:39.382
That was meant as a joke,
to break the ice.

05:39.426 --> 05:42.124
Mm. "Break the ice,"
that's an Earth idiom.

05:42.167 --> 05:44.866
I'm reporting to a human
captain. I like to be prepared.

05:44.909 --> 05:48.043
We're about to jump to Trill,
and while I'm on the surface,

05:48.086 --> 05:49.957
I'll ask for you to do
one-on-ones with the crew.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.525
No need. I've read their files.

05:51.568 --> 05:53.744
I'd like you to connect
with them in person.

05:53.788 --> 05:56.138
There are better ways to use me,

05:56.181 --> 05:57.879
like tracking
Moll and L'ak for one.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.402
I think we can both agree that

05:59.446 --> 06:02.013
connection is not exactly
where my skill set lies.

06:02.057 --> 06:04.407
Connection isn't a skill,
it's a choice.

06:04.451 --> 06:07.889
The only interaction my crew
has had with you was on Q'Mau,

06:07.932 --> 06:10.021
and it's left some skeptical
about my decision

06:10.065 --> 06:12.676
to bring you on.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.374
This is your chance

06:14.417 --> 06:17.332

you're right for the job.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.379
To "break the ice."

what I'm thinking?

07:45.421 --> 07:47.815
Uh, yeah,
th-this jumble of numbers

07:47.858 --> 07:49.686
from the Romulan tricorder,

07:49.730 --> 07:51.645
I can't make sense of.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.298

six months apart,

07:57.172 --> 08:00.915

that nervous to see him.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.831
You were young once,

08:03.874 --> 08:06.137
Okay, that's not my business.

08:06.181 --> 08:07.356
No.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.924
Trouble in paradise, genius.

Six months of trying to act
like everything's normal?

-Yeah.

Wow.

08:34.383 --> 08:36.341
I just sounded like
a woo-woo asshole.

08:36.385 --> 08:39.082
Nah, they'll be fine, but

Lieutenant Christopher,
request permission

08:48.440 --> 08:49.920

I'm sorry, Captain.

to beam down.

09:02.846 --> 09:05.893
Guardian Xi, is there a problem?

09:05.936 --> 09:07.590
There is.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.418
The information you seek

09:09.461 --> 09:11.507
has been protected
for centuries.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.509
Before we assist,

09:13.553 --> 09:15.685
there is a question
you must answer.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.644
I'm not sure you understand
the stakes here...

09:17.687 --> 09:20.429
This is not a matter for debate.

09:20.472 --> 09:23.214
You must answer the question.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.870
Then you better ask it.

09:28.611 --> 09:32.136
Where does the fourth point?

09:32.180 --> 09:33.790
What the hell
kind of question is that?

09:33.834 --> 09:36.619
GUARDIAN XI:
I can say nothing further.
Where...

09:36.663 --> 09:38.142
does the fourth point?

09:41.319 --> 09:43.713
It's a riddle.

09:43.757 --> 09:46.760
It's a reference to the poem
we found on Lyrek.

09:48.762 --> 09:51.460
The hidden fifth stanza
led us here. The fourth stanza

09:51.503 --> 09:53.288
seemed to point to Betazed.

09:56.813 --> 09:58.641
The answer is Betazed.

10:00.556 --> 10:01.775
That is correct.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.428
I can tell you now

10:03.472 --> 10:06.301
that the symbiont you seek
is indeed still alive.

10:06.344 --> 10:08.825
Its current host, Kalzara Bix,

10:08.869 --> 10:10.697
she will speak to no outsider

10:10.740 --> 10:12.960
unless they answer that riddle.

10:13.003 --> 10:14.744
Have others come looking?

10:14.788 --> 10:16.572
No, you are the first.

10:18.530 --> 10:22.012
Your team may transport
to the Caves of Mak'ala.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.405
I will bring her shortly.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.015
Before you go,

10:25.059 --> 10:26.626
is there anything else
you can tell us about her?

10:26.669 --> 10:28.802
Or he symbiont
or the poem on Lyrek?

10:28.845 --> 10:31.543
I've never heard
of Lyrek, Captain,

10:31.587 --> 10:33.545
and I know nothing of any poem.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.547
My duty was simply to ask

10:35.591 --> 10:37.593
the question
and verify the answer.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.117
From here forward,

[loud, overlapping chatter]

21:31.725 --> 21:34.162
My world needs a new starbase.

21:34.205 --> 21:37.687
We have all heard
what's happening with the Breen.

21:37.731 --> 21:39.167
They're growing
increasingly dangerous

21:39.210 --> 21:41.865
as the warring factions
vie for control.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.954
Which is why it is vital

21:43.998 --> 21:48.045
that all member worlds
receive fair attention,

21:48.089 --> 21:50.047
including yours.

21:50.091 --> 21:53.616
While adopting this change
would delay your starbase,

21:53.660 --> 21:56.315
I would also suggest and support

21:56.358 --> 21:59.840
an immediate increase in patrols
in your sector,

21:59.883 --> 22:01.885
subject to President Rillak's
approval, of course.

22:03.887 --> 22:06.542
In such a scenario, would you
consider your security needs

22:06.586 --> 22:08.979
to be appropriately addressed?

22:09.023 --> 22:14.289
Yes. That would be satisfactory.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.901
In that case...
All in favor?

22:23.603 --> 22:25.648
All opposed?

22:26.910 --> 22:29.522
The revision has been adopted.

22:29.565 --> 22:33.830
Thank you.
Let's take a short recess.

22:38.618 --> 22:40.576
May I have a word?

22:40.620 --> 22:43.231
-Of course.
-Ah.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.720
Ah.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.722
How may I help you, Mr. Duvin?

22:55.765 --> 22:58.986
I am curious what, if anything,
President T'Rina has told you

22:59.029 --> 23:01.815
of the conflicts her coalition
has had with the Vulcan Purists.

23:01.858 --> 23:03.817
Oh, I know
there has been conflict.

23:03.860 --> 23:05.645
Indeed.

23:05.688 --> 23:07.734
And as you were speaking,
I found myself wondering

23:07.777 --> 23:10.867
how they might make political
fodder out of your remarks.

23:10.911 --> 23:13.566
What you said could be seen
as a criticism

23:13.609 --> 23:15.698
of Ni'Var,
itself a larger world.

23:15.742 --> 23:18.353
And the fact that
President T'Rina voted with you

23:18.397 --> 23:20.616
-makes it...
-She did not vote with me.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.618
She voted according
to her own values

23:22.662 --> 23:24.054
and the needs of the Federation.

23:24.098 --> 23:25.621
While that may be true,

23:25.665 --> 23:27.623
appearances matter.

23:27.667 --> 23:30.321
In politics,
they are often all that matters.

23:30.365 --> 23:33.542
Typically, I would speak
with her directly,

23:33.586 --> 23:36.719
but I fear her logic is clouded
by both her love for you

23:36.763 --> 23:40.027
and her strong disapproval
of the Vulcan Purists.

23:40.070 --> 23:43.160
Therefore, logic and reason
dictates that I approach you.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.685
As you live in a near-constant
state of emotional compromise,

23:45.728 --> 23:48.035
you are therefore better
equipped to behave logically.

23:48.078 --> 23:50.080
With respect,

23:50.124 --> 23:53.997

36:06.729 --> 36:08.775
BURNHAM:
Go in there.

36:15.173 --> 36:19.220
They must have found that poem
on Lyrek, right?

36:19.264 --> 36:20.830
Sir, is that a question
for me, sir?

36:20.874 --> 36:22.223
No.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.530
-Didn't think so.
-Sorry I'm late.

36:24.573 --> 36:26.793
I was working on the data
from the Romulan tricorder,

36:26.836 --> 36:29.143
and I think
I've finally figured it out.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.580
As long
as it's mission-critical,

36:31.624 --> 36:33.321
use as many words as you'd like.

36:35.323 --> 36:37.412
Uh, well, um, the thing is,

36:37.456 --> 36:40.241
I hadn't accounted
for half-life.

36:40.285 --> 36:44.637
The Progenitors' technology is
several billion years old,

36:44.680 --> 36:47.596
so, of course that would result
in significant decay

36:47.640 --> 36:49.337
of numerous isotopes.

36:49.381 --> 36:54.908
I don't fully understand it yet,
but the technology is...

36:54.951 --> 36:58.303
It could have
incredible applications.

36:58.346 --> 37:01.262
One could use it
to design new life-forms,

37:01.306 --> 37:04.961
accelerate evolution,
modify ecosystems.

37:05.005 --> 37:07.399
And if it can create life,

37:07.442 --> 37:11.054
then, in theory,
it might even be possible

37:11.098 --> 37:13.535
to reanimate dead organisms.

37:13.579 --> 37:16.669
That sounds like it'd be very
dangerous in the wrong hands.

37:16.712 --> 37:18.540
Well, yes,
but think of all the good

37:18.584 --> 37:20.499
[laughing]:
it could do in the right ones!

37:20.542 --> 37:22.544
It could make even
the spore-drive discovery

37:22.588 --> 37:25.330
inconsequential by comparison.

37:25.373 --> 37:28.768
Commander, you have
any more data to share?

37:28.811 --> 37:32.337
Um... no, I guess not.

37:32.380 --> 37:36.384
Then your 20 words are up.
You're dismissed.

37:36.428 --> 37:40.214
Nice to meet you,
too, Commander.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.695
Okay. What?!

37:42.738 --> 37:44.566
What?

37:44.610 --> 37:47.787
I haven't seen him that excited
in so long.

37:47.830 --> 37:49.876
Why-why did you have
to shut him down like that?

37:49.919 --> 37:52.139
I got the information I needed.
Now I'm moving on.

37:52.182 --> 37:54.228
-Oh.
-Who's next?

37:54.272 --> 37:56.970
Ey. Uh, since you won't give me
permission to speak freely,

37:57.013 --> 37:58.406
I'm just gonna take it.

37:58.450 --> 38:01.061
Captain Burnham--
she sees something in you,

38:01.104 --> 38:03.933
but for the life of me,
I have no idea what it is.

38:03.977 --> 38:06.458
So, how about this? How about
I'm next? Here are my 20 words.

38:06.501 --> 38:11.854
Uh, you're on a new ship,
fresh off a demotion,

38:11.898 --> 38:15.510
trying to hide how hard that is

38:15.554 --> 38:17.643
by being a giant...

38:18.687 --> 38:21.516
Oh, that's 20 words, so...

38:21.560 --> 38:23.910
Excuse me, sir.
I have work to do.

38:23.953 --> 38:26.478
[sighs]

38:31.396 --> 38:33.354
Uh, T'Rina,

38:33.398 --> 38:35.965
I have been considering
our engagement announcement.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.445
I-I believe the...

38:37.489 --> 38:39.099
It has not yet gone out?

38:39.142 --> 38:42.232
No, but within a few hours.

38:43.277 --> 38:46.324
Ah. Uh, I wonder if perhaps

38:46.367 --> 38:50.284
we should consider postponing.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.809
Well, it-it is a very busy time
for you.

38:53.853 --> 38:56.986
And of course,
there is my new position.

38:57.030 --> 38:59.946
A public declaration may bring
undue pressure.

38:59.989 --> 39:04.472
And as I recall,
a wise Vulcan once said,

39:04.516 --> 39:07.997
"To rush a sehlat is
to risk a goring."

39:12.698 --> 39:15.396
Duvin spoke with you,
did he not?

39:15.440 --> 39:17.398
I...

39:17.442 --> 39:19.618
He did.

39:19.661 --> 39:21.968
He advised me not to announce.

39:22.011 --> 39:23.970
I took that into account
and decided otherwise.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.928
So now he turns to you.

39:25.972 --> 39:28.148
He seemed quite clear that
it would not be in the interest

39:28.191 --> 39:29.932
of your political career.

39:29.976 --> 39:33.109
I employ Duvin because he is
a shrewd political operator,

39:33.153 --> 39:35.808
but that does not mean that he
or anyone else, including you,

39:35.851 --> 39:38.027
understands my own interests
better than I.

39:38.071 --> 39:40.943
But if you would experience
a challenge

39:40.987 --> 39:43.946
from the Vulcan Purists,
we must consider that.

39:43.990 --> 39:48.298
Uh, I simply wish to protect you
in all ways that I can.

39:48.342 --> 39:51.127
It is unclear to me what would
have given you the impression

39:51.171 --> 39:53.129
that I'm in need of caretaker.

to explain any of that?

At least not
with the science we have now.

to have an answer.

The life of a symbiont is
a journey that spans centuries.
