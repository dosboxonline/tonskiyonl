WEBVTT

03:05.250 --> 03:06.333
Wait!

03:10.000 --> 03:13.041
Captain Silvo. The ship is yours.

03:15.625 --> 03:18.583
Excellent work, Brutus. Excellent.

03:20.791 --> 03:23.289
Now, take me to the vault.

03:23.290 --> 03:26.375
You've lost your ship.

03:26.875 --> 03:27.998
Don't lose your life.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.414
We are protected by New Republic decree--

03:30.415 --> 03:33.914
Open the vault.

03:33.915 --> 03:35.789
We have no credit shipment.

03:35.790 --> 03:37.164
This is a bulk freighter!

03:37.165 --> 03:41.081
If this is a bulk freighter,
why is your vault magnetically sealed?

03:41.082 --> 03:43.123
We are protected by New Republic decree.

03:43.124 --> 03:47.207
I hereby demand all pirate scum
leave this vessel immediately!

03:53.500 --> 03:55.623
- Throw him out the airlock.
- Aye, Captain.

03:55.624 --> 03:57.083
And open the vault!

03:58.833 --> 03:59.833
No!

04:00.416 --> 04:01.414
No!

04:01.415 --> 04:04.706
I know
these cycles have been lean.

04:04.707 --> 04:07.081
That some of you have all
but given up on me,

04:07.082 --> 04:09.000
your good old captain.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.206
It's all forgotten now.

04:11.207 --> 04:15.416
Because at long last, I've brought you
to the only thing that matters.

04:17.583 --> 04:22.375
Cold, hard credits.

04:53.333 --> 04:59.207
Good men's lives lost
for a single, measly credit?

05:07.041 --> 05:08.291
Mutiny, then?

05:33.208 --> 05:34.956
Unhand me, you villain!

05:34.957 --> 05:36.206
Never.

05:36.207 --> 05:40.789
You'll spend eternity in my dungeons,
being tortured until you die.

05:40.790 --> 05:43.541
No!

05:46.958 --> 05:48.164
Wim!

05:48.165 --> 05:50.666
Wim, you're gonna be late for school.

05:52.041 --> 05:55.333
Don't forget your jacket!

05:55.833 --> 05:57.541
I didn't.

05:59.166 --> 06:00.956
I can't find my passcard.

06:00.957 --> 06:02.623
Were you playing with it again?

06:02.624 --> 06:04.623
I told you, don't touch my work stuff.

06:04.624 --> 06:08.206
Hey, could you please not leave your toys
out all over the house?

06:08.207 --> 06:09.789
I keep stepping on them.

06:09.790 --> 06:11.164
Now listen up.

06:11.165 --> 06:15.416
I'm going to be late all week, so here.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.664
Oh, shoot.

06:18.665 --> 06:19.750
All right.

06:20.541 --> 06:23.456
Um, there should be a repair droid
coming by to look at the garage.

06:23.457 --> 06:25.123
Are you listening to any of this?

06:25.124 --> 06:27.373
I didn't play with your passcard.

06:27.374 --> 06:31.123
I have a Supervisor's review,
so I'm not gonna be around much.

06:31.124 --> 06:35.123
That is your lunch money for the week,
all right? Oh.

06:35.124 --> 06:36.416
Okay.

06:37.208 --> 06:38.206
Here it is.

06:38.207 --> 06:39.291
I gotta go.

06:40.708 --> 06:41.956
Don't be late for school.

06:41.957 --> 06:43.166
I won't.

06:47.541 --> 06:50.791
Whoa! Whoa!

07:01.916 --> 07:03.333
Sorry, Mrs. Ikk!

07:20.250 --> 07:22.915
You should not have come here.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.458
No! My arm!

07:46.708 --> 07:49.414
My guts! They're everywhere!

07:49.415 --> 07:51.706
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What?

07:51.707 --> 07:53.664
I think I have something in my eye.

07:53.665 --> 07:55.416
I think it's an eyelash maybe?

07:55.958 --> 07:58.666
What are you guys even doing?

08:04.375 --> 08:06.414
Please remain seated

08:06.415 --> 08:07.498
while the tram is in mo--

08:07.499 --> 08:09.041
Hey, who did that?

08:09.541 --> 08:12.625
Hey, who did that? All right--

08:13.666 --> 08:15.873
I was so stuck
on problem number five

08:15.874 --> 08:17.748
until, you'll never believe this,

08:17.749 --> 08:21.331
but I totally switched
the basic table of seven and nine!

08:21.332 --> 08:23.539
Has that ever happened to you?

08:23.540 --> 08:24.914
Oh, boy.

08:24.915 --> 08:27.664
I sure hope
I don't do something like that tomorrow.

08:27.665 --> 08:29.916
That was a pain in the trunk.

08:32.250 --> 08:35.873
Oh, yeah! On number eight,
you had to multiply these two matrices.

08:35.874 --> 08:36.956
You remember?

08:36.957 --> 08:39.125
- Did you just see that?
- See what?

08:40.166 --> 08:43.291
Oh, and number eight was so complicated...

09:18.083 --> 09:20.000
Students, proceed to class.

09:20.333 --> 09:22.291
Students, proceed to class.

09:22.791 --> 09:25.123
Students, proceed to class.

09:25.124 --> 09:27.998
Students who are truant
will face detention.

09:27.999 --> 09:29.164
Students who are truant

09:29.165 --> 09:30.916
will face detention.

09:33.041 --> 09:34.914
Time for school now, students.

09:34.915 --> 09:37.998
Enjoy another day of learning.
Don't be late.

09:37.999 --> 09:41.581
Students who are late to class
will receive an infraction.

09:41.582 --> 09:46.998
By substituting error-prone ledger entries
with free-floating variable tables

09:46.999 --> 09:51.789
in which a series of matrices
are organized by a labelling algorithm.

09:51.790 --> 09:55.039
Contrast this method with the approach
practiced in planets

09:55.040 --> 09:56.581
outside the Barrier

09:56.582 --> 09:58.414
called liquidity modelling...

09:58.415 --> 10:01.706
...in which a computation
takes the place of labelling.

10:01.707 --> 10:03.456
Here, inside the Barrier,

10:03.457 --> 10:07.039
we take into account
the fungibility of multiple currencies

10:07.040 --> 10:09.873
by further analyzing the potential risk

10:09.874 --> 10:12.789
of loss over time of any ledger.

10:12.790 --> 10:16.248
And now class,
it is time for a special visitor

10:16.249 --> 10:18.456
from the Office of the Supervisor.

10:18.457 --> 10:22.206
Good afternoon, children.
My name is Undersecretary Fara.

10:22.207 --> 10:24.831
Hello, Undersecretary Fara.

10:24.832 --> 10:28.748
Today I've taken time
out of my very busy schedule

10:28.749 --> 10:32.456
to come talk about something
near and dear to my heart.

10:32.457 --> 10:35.500
Tomorrow's Career Assessment Test.

10:36.416 --> 10:38.039
- Tomorrow?
- In a way...

10:38.040 --> 10:39.248
- Shh!
- ...this one test

10:39.249 --> 10:41.916
will set the course of your entire future.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.831
Once you're assigned a career path,

10:44.832 --> 10:49.956
you'll become part of our planet
At Attin's contribution to the Great Work.

10:49.957 --> 10:54.039
Keeping the Republic peaceful and strong.

10:54.040 --> 10:56.998
Students, tell the Undersecretary
how you would like

10:56.999 --> 10:58.916
to contribute to the Great Work.

10:59.500 --> 11:01.498
- Oh, oh!
- Yes, Roona?

11:01.499 --> 11:04.331
I want to be
a senior statistical accountant!

11:04.332 --> 11:05.664
Ah, yes.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.166
And... you.

11:11.291 --> 11:13.039
No fair. I want to be an analyst.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.291
Don't worry.
We need all the analysts we can get.

11:16.916 --> 11:19.250
And...

11:22.666 --> 11:24.333
you.

11:26.208 --> 11:29.333
Well, my dad's
a Systems Coordinator but...

11:30.208 --> 11:33.039
I think I wanna really help people,
you know?

11:33.040 --> 11:35.206
Like if there's danger or something.

11:35.207 --> 11:38.707
That's not a career.
That's what Safety Droids are for.

11:41.083 --> 11:44.623
Study hard, get plenty of rest.
And don't be nervous.

11:44.624 --> 11:49.083
Remember,
we all have a place in the Great Work.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.789
I can't believe it.

11:52.790 --> 11:55.956
Did you seriously not know
Assessment was tomorrow?

11:55.957 --> 11:58.914
Why do you think
everyone's all studying all the time?

11:58.915 --> 12:00.539
I don't know. I--

12:00.540 --> 12:02.914
Aren't we always studying all the time?

12:02.915 --> 12:05.581
Are you gonna fail?
'Cause I could fail too.

12:05.582 --> 12:07.914
At least we'd still be
in the same class together.

12:07.915 --> 12:09.623
Neel, I'm not gonna fail.

12:09.624 --> 12:12.581
I don't wanna get held back, Wim.

12:12.582 --> 12:14.956
I wouldn't be in the same class
with Roona anymore.

12:14.957 --> 12:16.250
"As Roona?"

12:18.958 --> 12:20.164
I like her.

12:20.165 --> 12:22.289
But you've never even talked to her.

12:22.290 --> 12:24.998
I'm working up to it.

12:24.999 --> 12:27.998
I can't believe you said you wanted
to be a Jedi when you grow up.

12:27.999 --> 12:29.664
What? No, I didn't.

12:29.665 --> 12:32.041
- Uh, you basically did.
- I didn't.

12:32.541 --> 12:34.498
Um, well, basically, you did.

12:34.499 --> 12:38.039
Well, so what if I did? I'm--

12:38.040 --> 12:40.458
Don't you ever want
to do anything exciting?

12:42.541 --> 12:43.540
Like what?

12:46.416 --> 12:48.500
No hoverbikes on the path!

12:59.958 --> 13:02.458
Careful!

13:04.375 --> 13:05.583
Whoa!

13:10.958 --> 13:12.208
Wasn't that great?

13:25.375 --> 13:26.875
I guess we're walking.

13:37.791 --> 13:41.250
All right. Well, just don't stay up
too late studying, okay?

13:42.750 --> 13:44.333
You're gonna do great tomorrow!

13:47.416 --> 13:48.748
I'm home!

13:48.749 --> 13:50.289
- Neel! Neel!
- Neel's home.

13:50.290 --> 13:51.706
Hey, Mom! Hey, Dad!

13:51.707 --> 13:52.789
Hey, buddy!

13:52.790 --> 13:54.373
- Welcome home!
- Hey, Jorko and Jobo.

13:54.374 --> 13:56.333
- Hi.
- And little baby Tuloo!

14:26.541 --> 14:27.833
It's no good, Fern.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.000
This one's all corroded.

14:32.916 --> 14:33.916
Fern?

14:35.166 --> 14:37.250
Gotta get a new power converter.

14:39.083 --> 14:40.791
Scrapyard's picked over.

14:43.291 --> 14:44.625
Hey, wastoids!

14:45.416 --> 14:47.289
Heard you had some trouble with your bike.

14:47.290 --> 14:50.373
That's the problem with baby toys.
They break so easy.

14:50.374 --> 14:52.248
We can still race!

14:52.249 --> 14:53.331
Really?

14:53.332 --> 14:56.331
Be there this weekend.
If your mommy lets you.

14:56.332 --> 14:57.875
Bye, losers!

14:59.541 --> 15:01.750
Maybe we should ask to postpone.

15:02.333 --> 15:03.333
No way.

15:03.916 --> 15:05.664
You gotta act tough.

15:05.665 --> 15:08.125
It's the only way
to deal with jerks like that.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.916
Who cares about racing Bonjj Phalfa?

15:11.625 --> 15:13.039
I care.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.500
What else fun is there to do
on this planet?

15:16.041 --> 15:17.206
See you tomorrow.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.750
Keep your eyes out
for a new power converter.

15:39.833 --> 15:40.956
Hello, Fern.

15:40.957 --> 15:43.164
Your mother is home from work early.

15:43.165 --> 15:44.414
Crud.

15:44.415 --> 15:47.331
Hide all this. And if she asks,
I was upstairs studying.

15:47.332 --> 15:49.331
But you weren't upstairs studying.

15:49.332 --> 15:51.123
Run memory override.

15:51.124 --> 15:53.123
Yes, I was. You just didn't see me.

15:53.124 --> 15:55.625
I didn't see you, Fern.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.581
Fern, is that you?

15:59.582 --> 16:01.914
Oh, hey, Mom.
I was just studying in my room.

16:01.915 --> 16:04.875
Yes, Fern was studying in her room.

16:07.625 --> 16:09.375
You have anything to share with me?

16:11.250 --> 16:12.250
Um...

16:17.458 --> 16:18.625
You got your spot back.

16:19.208 --> 16:21.039
Head of the class!

16:21.040 --> 16:22.539
Mom, why do you even have this?

16:22.540 --> 16:24.581
I had to go by your school.

16:24.582 --> 16:26.456
Just be sure not to let it slip again.

16:26.457 --> 16:28.081
Mom.

16:28.082 --> 16:30.958
I worry because there's not a place
for everyone at the top.

16:32.250 --> 16:33.250
I know.

16:34.541 --> 16:36.416
I'm just so proud of you.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.414
Point zero-zero-zero-five.

16:42.415 --> 16:43.873
Wim, I'm home.

16:43.874 --> 16:45.291
Nine-six-seven.

16:46.416 --> 16:47.706
No. Wait.

16:47.707 --> 16:50.123
Hey, look at that. Studying for a change.

16:50.124 --> 16:51.664
Ask me one.

16:51.665 --> 16:54.375
Uh, what's the basic table of five?

16:54.875 --> 16:58.414
One point six-zero-nine... four?

16:58.415 --> 16:59.956
Almost.

16:59.957 --> 17:01.333
You'll get it eventually.

17:04.000 --> 17:06.123
I don't think I can sleep.

17:06.124 --> 17:08.998
Will you please read me a story
like Mom used to?

17:08.999 --> 17:11.041
Uh, sorry, buddy. I gotta work.

17:14.875 --> 17:16.125
Bedtime stories?

17:17.125 --> 17:19.541
Aren't you getting
a little bit old for that?

17:21.291 --> 17:22.291
Love you.

17:24.333 --> 17:25.416
Love you.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.248
Wim!

18:26.249 --> 18:27.956
No! Wait!

18:27.957 --> 18:29.206
Stop the tram!

18:29.207 --> 18:30.373
I overslept!

18:30.374 --> 18:31.914
You can make it!

18:31.915 --> 18:34.500
I'm gonna take a shortcut!

18:35.083 --> 18:36.208
A what?

18:36.791 --> 18:38.875
A shortcut!

19:20.625 --> 19:23.456
With eyes on your own desk
until Assessment is complete.

19:23.457 --> 19:26.289
If you skip a section,
you will not be able to repeat it.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.831
No unauthorized datapads
or comlinks are allowed

19:28.832 --> 19:30.956
during any of the testing sections.

19:30.957 --> 19:32.539
If you must use the refresher,

19:32.540 --> 19:34.998
remain seated and utilize
your desk controls.

19:34.999 --> 19:36.914
If you finish a section early,
wait silently

19:36.915 --> 19:39.248
- for the next section to begin.
- Where are you, Wim?

19:39.249 --> 19:40.331
Any questions?

19:40.332 --> 19:44.914
Uh, what if, say, someone missed
their tram so they're taking a shortcut,

19:44.915 --> 19:46.164
- and--
- Sit down, student.

19:46.165 --> 19:47.706
The test will begin shortly.

19:47.707 --> 19:49.583
Sit.

20:28.916 --> 20:30.125
No!

20:59.666 --> 21:01.833
Help!

22:03.083 --> 22:04.289
- Student...
- Whoa!

22:04.290 --> 22:07.248
...you are in violation
of school attendance protocols.

22:07.249 --> 22:08.958
- Come with me.
- Okay.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.290
Uh... How?

22:20.125 --> 22:21.373
How much longer?

22:21.374 --> 22:23.457
The Proctor will see you shortly.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.083
What are you in for?

22:48.250 --> 22:50.625
I missed my Assessment.

22:52.958 --> 22:54.581
What are you in for?

22:54.582 --> 22:56.750
I race bikes so the droids hate me.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.331
I saw your bike.

22:59.332 --> 23:00.958
It's totally wizard.

23:07.083 --> 23:08.125
You know,

23:10.041 --> 23:13.206
the last kid who skipped Assessment,
the Proctor took him down

23:13.207 --> 23:16.373
to a secret chamber under the school

23:16.374 --> 23:18.081
to make him work in the mines.

23:18.082 --> 23:19.373
Mines?

23:19.374 --> 23:21.458
Never saw him again.

23:22.458 --> 23:23.914
Yeah, right.

23:23.915 --> 23:25.250
That's so made up.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.541
Oh! Proctor, I--

23:31.541 --> 23:35.539
I got pulled out of a review
because you skipped your test?

23:35.540 --> 23:37.914
- No, I didn't skip--
- What happened to your clothes?

23:37.915 --> 23:38.998
Dad, that doesn't--

23:38.999 --> 23:41.373
This is absolutely unacceptable,
young man.

23:41.374 --> 23:44.539
Dad, that doesn't matter, because
I found something buried in the woods.

23:44.540 --> 23:46.873
I think it's a lost Jedi temple like this.

23:46.874 --> 23:48.456
A Jedi-- Wim!

23:48.457 --> 23:50.831
I convinced the Proctor
to let you retake the test,

23:50.832 --> 23:53.123
but now there's a fifty-point penalty,

23:53.124 --> 23:56.748
which means you have
to get every answer right just to pass.

23:56.749 --> 23:59.373
- Every answer...
- So can it with this Jedi temple nonsense.

23:59.374 --> 24:02.623
You go home, you study.
Tomorrow, I will drop you off personally.

24:02.624 --> 24:05.375
I expect you to pass. Do you understand?

24:07.625 --> 24:08.625
Yes, sir.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.708
I gotta get back to work.

24:17.750 --> 24:19.666
A Jedi temple out in the woods?

24:20.458 --> 24:21.456
What?

24:21.457 --> 24:23.708
You said you found a Jedi temple
out in the woods.

24:25.541 --> 24:26.914
Oh. No.

24:26.915 --> 24:30.666
I was... lying.

24:31.791 --> 24:35.708
I-- I better go home like my dad said.

24:36.791 --> 24:38.916
So...

24:59.166 --> 25:01.414
Tuloo! Hi.

25:01.415 --> 25:02.791
Where's Neel?

25:08.833 --> 25:10.914
Oh, my goodness!

25:10.915 --> 25:13.498
Wim, you missed the whole test!
What happened?

25:13.499 --> 25:15.958
Does your dad still got all those tools?

25:17.791 --> 25:19.206
Okay, what do we got here?

25:19.207 --> 25:21.289
If you found a real Jedi temple,

25:21.290 --> 25:22.956
shouldn't we tell the Supervisor?

25:22.957 --> 25:24.831
Or maybe our parents?

25:24.832 --> 25:28.123
- Why do we have to dig it up?
- Uh...

25:28.124 --> 25:31.831
'Cause this could be a real adventure.
No more pretend.

25:31.832 --> 25:34.248
You didn't even ask how Assessment went.

25:34.249 --> 25:36.539
- How did Assessment go?
- I think good!

25:36.540 --> 25:39.623
- Okay, that's great. Let's go.
- But promise we won't get in trouble.

25:39.624 --> 25:40.831
I promise.

25:40.832 --> 25:41.916
Okay.

25:51.291 --> 25:52.873
<i>Jedi One checking in.</i>

25:52.874 --> 25:54.914
What should my comm sign be?

25:54.915 --> 25:56.373
Oh, I know.

25:56.374 --> 25:58.081
<i>Jedi Two checking in.</i>

25:58.082 --> 26:00.165
<i>- Read you loud and clear.
- Copy.</i>

26:23.958 --> 26:26.748
I changed my mind.
You should be studying instead.

26:26.749 --> 26:29.206
- I can help--
- I'll study after. I can do both.

26:29.207 --> 26:30.664
Here, just hold the rope.

26:30.665 --> 26:33.333
- Okay. Careful of rope burn.
- Right.

26:33.916 --> 26:35.916
- Okay. Ready?
- Yeah.

26:36.416 --> 26:38.124
Three, two...

26:50.750 --> 26:52.789
- Oh, man.
- I thought you had me.

26:52.790 --> 26:54.875
Your bones are too heavy.

27:01.500 --> 27:03.208
Look. Look.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.081
There it is.

27:06.082 --> 27:09.123
It's probably just buried junk.

27:09.124 --> 27:10.581
In the middle of the woods?

27:10.582 --> 27:12.831
Wait. Where are we?

27:12.832 --> 27:13.916
Wait a minute.

27:16.416 --> 27:18.956
- Someone's been here.
- Trespassers.

27:18.957 --> 27:20.664
State your names.

27:20.665 --> 27:22.123
- Wim.
- Neel.

27:22.124 --> 27:24.289
You are in violation
of protocol.

27:24.290 --> 27:26.664
Answer or be vaporized.

27:26.665 --> 27:28.539
Who do you have a crush on at school?

27:28.540 --> 27:29.915
- What?
- Roona!

27:37.708 --> 27:40.039
Sorry.
Fern made me say it.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.875
Oops. Hang on.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.583
Sorry. She made me do that.

27:49.750 --> 27:51.000
You.

27:51.916 --> 27:52.916
Me.

27:55.583 --> 27:56.708
Name's Fern.

27:57.958 --> 27:58.958
She's KB.

27:59.541 --> 28:01.333
And this is our find.

28:02.416 --> 28:03.831
We're gonna strip it for parts.

28:03.832 --> 28:05.414
This is mine.

28:05.415 --> 28:06.498
I already claimed it.

28:06.499 --> 28:08.831
I called un-claimsies
then claimed it for me and KB.

28:08.832 --> 28:09.914
No boys allowed.

28:09.915 --> 28:12.456
No calling un-claimsies
without the claimer.

28:12.457 --> 28:15.039
Everyone on the whole planet knows that.

28:15.040 --> 28:16.125
Fine.

28:17.583 --> 28:18.873
Then I call un-claimsies now!

28:18.874 --> 28:19.998
- Claimsies.
- Claimsies.

28:19.999 --> 28:21.083
Blast it.

28:21.666 --> 28:22.706
Thanks, KB.

28:22.707 --> 28:24.831
They called claimsies. It checks out.

28:24.832 --> 28:26.456
- Neel!
- And now I call no boys.

28:26.457 --> 28:28.623
This is ours.
We came here to dig.

28:28.624 --> 28:30.623
Oh, you can still dig.

28:30.624 --> 28:32.748
- As our employees.
- Okay.

28:32.749 --> 28:34.956
Neel! We don't work for them.

28:34.957 --> 28:36.539
They don't even know what this is.

28:36.540 --> 28:37.914
It's not a Jedi temple.

28:37.915 --> 28:39.039
Yeah-huh, it is.

28:39.040 --> 28:40.539
No, it's not.

28:40.540 --> 28:44.164
See, this was supposed to be
a new neighborhood development.

28:44.165 --> 28:45.625
Grandpa told me all about it.

28:46.708 --> 28:49.291
Something went wrong
with the sewage substation.

28:49.791 --> 28:52.123
Whole thing filled up with poison gas.

28:52.124 --> 28:54.289
Didn't kill them, though,
just made them crazy.

28:54.290 --> 28:56.541
They started to eat each other.

28:58.166 --> 28:59.914
There was no choice.

28:59.915 --> 29:04.416
They had to bury them alive,
trapped underground forever.

29:11.333 --> 29:12.958
My grandpa says

29:13.958 --> 29:16.833
if you listen really closely,

29:18.583 --> 29:22.248
you can still hear them
banging on the doors...

29:22.249 --> 29:23.749
trying to get out.

29:38.583 --> 29:41.539
That wasn't funny.

29:41.540 --> 29:42.873
You are so gullible.

29:42.874 --> 29:44.164
'Cause you're a liar.

29:44.165 --> 29:46.164
Well, you guys do look pretty strong, though.

29:46.165 --> 29:48.333
Yeah, way stronger than you.

29:48.916 --> 29:51.998
Oh, it's too bad we're not strong enough
to dig the rest of it out.

29:51.999 --> 29:53.083
Fern.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.083
- We can.
- Yeah!

29:58.833 --> 30:01.708
But if we open it,
then we get to go in and look.

30:04.291 --> 30:05.500
Deal?

30:12.583 --> 30:13.750
Deal.

30:33.541 --> 30:35.750
Wim, you left the garage door open.

30:37.583 --> 30:39.041
You'd better be studying!

30:45.000 --> 30:46.000
Wim?

30:52.708 --> 30:56.289
Then when we get inside,
we recall claimsies

30:56.290 --> 30:58.956
because they only claimed the outside.

30:58.957 --> 31:03.539
- That's... genius.
- I know.

31:03.540 --> 31:04.916
These girls are so dumb.

31:08.708 --> 31:09.998
Hey, watch it!

31:09.999 --> 31:11.750
These boys are so dumb.

31:13.458 --> 31:15.081
You didn't have to be so mean.

31:15.082 --> 31:16.333
They did find it.

31:19.291 --> 31:20.458
What do you think it is?

31:21.583 --> 31:22.625
No idea.

31:23.625 --> 31:26.000
But I bet there's
an old power converter in there.

31:27.625 --> 31:29.623
- Neel, what about up here?
- Up where?

31:29.624 --> 31:31.456
Whoa.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.625
Never mind.

31:56.416 --> 31:57.875
- What's she doing?
- Quiet.

32:44.416 --> 32:45.625
Hello?

32:53.583 --> 32:55.123
Wim!

32:55.124 --> 32:56.373
- Wait.
- Wim!

32:56.374 --> 32:57.916
- Did you guys hear that?
- Hear what?

32:58.500 --> 33:00.083
- Wim!
- Someone's coming.

33:00.708 --> 33:01.875
We gotta hide.

33:02.375 --> 33:03.583
- The bags.
- The bike.

33:05.291 --> 33:06.291
Through over here!

33:08.500 --> 33:10.831
Come on!

33:10.832 --> 33:12.498
- How do you know someone's--
- Shh!

33:12.499 --> 33:13.666
Listen.

33:18.125 --> 33:19.416
Wim?

33:24.125 --> 33:25.125
Wim!

33:28.375 --> 33:29.375
Wim!

33:31.166 --> 33:32.664
Wim!

33:32.665 --> 33:34.956
- Is that your dad?
- Shh!

33:34.957 --> 33:36.039
Wim!

33:36.040 --> 33:38.039
You're gonna be in so much trouble!

33:38.040 --> 33:39.248
Wait. Why?

33:39.249 --> 33:42.123
'Cause his dad told him to can it
about the Jedi temple

33:42.124 --> 33:44.331
and not come out here

33:44.332 --> 33:46.291
and he did anyway.

33:46.833 --> 33:48.456
You're gonna be in so much trouble.

33:48.457 --> 33:50.500
No. Not when he sees that I'm right.

33:51.041 --> 33:53.914
Wim! What are you doing?

33:53.915 --> 33:55.000
Come on.

33:56.875 --> 33:58.041
Wait up for me.

34:05.125 --> 34:07.250
A skeleton!

34:18.666 --> 34:20.456
It's just a droid.

34:20.457 --> 34:22.291
A dead droid.

34:24.750 --> 34:26.706
It looks like it died pulling this lever.

34:26.707 --> 34:28.248
Do not touch that.

34:28.249 --> 34:30.498
- Well, I'm not gonna pull it.
- Well, you almost did.

34:30.499 --> 34:32.664
- Well, I'm not going to.
- Okay, then don't.

34:32.665 --> 34:34.498
Well, I won't.
Just because I'm about to...

34:34.499 --> 34:36.999
- I think there's something inside.
- How am I supposed to--

34:42.708 --> 34:44.164
- Oh, no!
- No! No!

34:44.165 --> 34:46.123
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No, no, no. No.

34:46.124 --> 34:47.206
Help!

34:47.207 --> 34:48.331
Someone help!

34:48.332 --> 34:49.998
Hey! We're in here!

34:49.999 --> 34:51.708
- We're in here!
- Hey! Hey!

34:54.041 --> 34:55.041
Help!

34:58.083 --> 35:00.539
Please help.

35:00.540 --> 35:02.748
The door won't open without power.

35:02.749 --> 35:06.791
If we follow that conduit,
we might find the power source.

35:07.583 --> 35:08.708
Good idea, KB.

35:10.708 --> 35:12.998
There's gotta be another way out.

35:12.999 --> 35:16.289
Jedi temples have all sorts
of secret passageways.

35:16.290 --> 35:17.541
Just ignore him.

35:18.625 --> 35:20.166
And don't touch anything.

35:21.583 --> 35:23.375
This is so great.

35:25.333 --> 35:26.331
Great?

35:26.332 --> 35:29.623
Yeah, it's exciting. We're exploring.

35:29.624 --> 35:31.998
Yeah. Exploring.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.373
Did you know that some Jedi temples
could lower down

35:34.374 --> 35:36.498
and bury themselves in times of danger?

35:36.499 --> 35:41.291
Listen, all we gotta do is find
the power before we run out of air.

35:43.958 --> 35:45.041
Where's KB?

35:45.791 --> 35:48.498
The conduit goes down here.

35:48.499 --> 35:49.748
Actually, we need to go up.

35:49.749 --> 35:52.208
No, you need to grow up.

35:59.666 --> 36:01.916
Neel, you're going with the girls?

36:04.916 --> 36:06.875
I just wanna go home.

36:13.916 --> 36:15.041
Fine.

36:17.791 --> 36:18.833
You know what?

36:19.833 --> 36:21.250
I don't need you guys.

36:22.541 --> 36:25.164
This is great.

36:25.165 --> 36:27.958
My own Jedi temple!

36:29.083 --> 36:30.875
Yep.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.666
And I have it all to mys--

36:43.541 --> 36:44.541
Grow up?

36:45.166 --> 36:46.833
You grow up.

36:50.666 --> 36:51.875
This has gotta be it.

36:54.083 --> 36:56.498
It's in some sort of hibernation mode.

36:56.499 --> 36:59.125
How'd you guys get down?

37:01.208 --> 37:02.208
So wake it up.

37:02.791 --> 37:04.498
Wait. Wake what up?

37:04.499 --> 37:06.039
What are you waking up?

37:06.040 --> 37:08.083
Just get me outta here.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.706
Jedi One to Jedi Two.

38:15.707 --> 38:19.164
<i>I found something amazing.
But don't tell the girls.</i>

38:19.165 --> 38:23.956
Whatever it is, don't touch it.

38:23.957 --> 38:26.664
<i>Fern? Okay, listen, I was wrong.</i>

38:26.665 --> 38:28.998
<i>It isn't a temple. It's even better.</i>

38:28.999 --> 38:31.414
Don't touch anything. The power's up.

38:31.415 --> 38:35.250
<i>We can open the hatch,
get out and get back home. Okay?</i>

38:36.458 --> 38:37.624
'Kay.

38:44.583 --> 38:47.083
<i>Wim. Hello?</i>

38:53.416 --> 38:55.750
- Fern?
- Come on, KB. Let's go! Let's go!

38:57.708 --> 39:00.125
Stop!

39:02.125 --> 39:05.166
- I didn't touch anything, I swear.
- Faster. Get to the hatch.

39:08.333 --> 39:10.000
Okay.

39:56.500 --> 39:57.958
It's a starship?

40:05.458 --> 40:06.791
Wim, look!

40:08.500 --> 40:09.873
Dad! Dad! Up here!

40:09.874 --> 40:11.958
- Wim!
- Dad!

40:16.166 --> 40:18.750
No!

40:19.625 --> 40:21.833
- Dad! Dad!
- Wim!

40:28.416 --> 40:29.831
Wim! Grab onto my arm!

40:29.832 --> 40:31.416
Wim, you gotta hold on!

40:34.041 --> 40:35.041
Go!

40:36.958 --> 40:38.790
No!

40:40.208 --> 40:41.333
We'll pull you in!

40:46.291 --> 40:47.291
Wim!

40:54.166 --> 40:55.166
Wim!

41:12.625 --> 41:15.373
Is that the-- Barrier!

41:15.374 --> 41:16.998
We're gonna go through the Barrier!

41:16.999 --> 41:19.166
- We gotta turn around. Right now!
- Okay.

41:22.041 --> 41:23.041
Okay.

41:24.416 --> 41:25.873
Maybe it's on autopilot.

41:25.874 --> 41:28.208
Find a button that says "auto."

41:47.416 --> 41:51.166
What are those?

41:52.250 --> 41:55.666
I think they're... uh, planets.

41:57.666 --> 41:58.916
They're stars.

41:59.916 --> 42:02.000
I didn't know there'd be so many.
