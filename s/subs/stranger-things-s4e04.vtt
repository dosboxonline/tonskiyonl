00:06.006 --> 00:08.008
[dramatic music echoing]

00:09.759 --> 00:11.094
[owl hooting]

00:12.053 --> 00:14.848
[Jonathan] I'm sorry. I'm having trouble
understanding any of this.

00:14.931 --> 00:18.560
I mean, what exactly is going on
in Hawkins? What's doing these killings?

00:18.643 --> 00:21.938
-That's what we're trying to ascertain.
-Where is El, like, right now?

00:22.022 --> 00:25.650
-For her safety, it's best you don't know.
-This is insane! This is insane!

00:25.734 --> 00:29.571
So this training to get El's powers back,
how long is it gonna take?

00:29.654 --> 00:31.948
-Could take weeks, could take months.
-Months?

00:32.032 --> 00:34.701
Until then, agents Harmon and Wallace
will stay with you.

00:34.784 --> 00:36.202
We're not in danger.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.579
Our friends live in Hawkins.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.164
My family lives in Hawkins.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.750
I'll work to contain the situation
until Eleven is ready.

00:41.833 --> 00:46.004
In the meantime, it is of vital importance
you do not speak to anyone about this.

00:46.087 --> 00:47.630
[scoffs] No. No way.

00:47.714 --> 00:51.009
-I know this is difficult to understand.
-It's not difficult. This is impossible.

00:51.092 --> 00:55.388
There are factions within our government
who are working directly against Eleven,

00:55.472 --> 00:58.475
who are, in fact,
searching for her as we speak.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.101
We can't risk contact.

01:00.185 --> 01:03.188
If they learned about any of this,
it will jeopardize Eleven.

01:03.271 --> 01:06.775
And if Eleven is jeopardized,
so are your friends.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.193
And so is your family.

01:08.276 --> 01:11.613
[scoffs] So, what? We're just supposed
to trust that you're the good guys?

01:11.696 --> 01:12.739
Whoever you are?

01:12.822 --> 01:14.657
We're friends of Owens.

01:15.366 --> 01:16.868
[dramatic music continues]

01:16.951 --> 01:18.828
Eleven trusted us.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.164
Now we're asking the same from you.

01:25.752 --> 01:26.795
For you.

01:27.545 --> 01:28.546
[Jonathan sighs]

01:31.257 --> 01:32.258
[Will sighs heavily]

[tires screech]

02:00.370 --> 02:02.372
[dramatic music builds]

02:07.001 --> 02:08.253
[Max] It was here.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.420
Right here.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.423
A grandfather clock?

02:13.299 --> 02:15.301
-[clock chiming]
-[audio distortion]

02:16.177 --> 02:17.720
It was so real.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.389
[clock ticking, chiming]

02:19.472 --> 02:22.433
[Max] And then,
when I got closer, suddenly I just…

02:23.726 --> 02:25.520
-[Dustin] Max, come on.
-[Steve] Max?

02:25.603 --> 02:26.938
…I woke up.

02:27.021 --> 02:28.314
[eerie audio distortion]

02:28.398 --> 02:29.566
[panting]

02:29.649 --> 02:32.193
[Dustin] It was like
she was in a trance or something.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.445
Exactly what Eddie said
happened to Chrissy.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.660
That's not even the bad part.

02:42.287 --> 02:45.373
Fred and Chrissy,
they both came to Miss Kelley for help.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.959
Uh, they both were having headaches,

02:48.501 --> 02:50.753
bad headaches
that wouldn't go away. And then…

02:51.629 --> 02:52.881
then the nightmares.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.758
Trouble sleeping.

02:56.342 --> 02:58.303
They'd wake up in a cold sweat.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.013
Then they started seeing things.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.848
[unsettling rustling]

03:01.931 --> 03:02.807
[screaming echoes]

03:03.516 --> 03:04.517
Bad things.

03:05.476 --> 03:06.561
From their pasts.

03:06.644 --> 03:07.604
[moans]

03:07.687 --> 03:09.397
These visions, they just…

03:09.480 --> 03:12.692
they kept on getting worse and worse,
until eventually…

03:14.777 --> 03:15.862
everything ended.

03:15.945 --> 03:17.113
[police radio chatter]

03:17.197 --> 03:18.740
[police sirens ringing]

03:19.490 --> 03:20.491
Vecna's curse.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.535
Chrissy's headache started a week ago.

03:24.704 --> 03:25.955
Fred's, six days ago.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.793
I've been having them for five days.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.087
I don't know how long I have.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.797
All I know is that,

03:35.632 --> 03:36.925
for Fred and Chrissy,

03:37.008 --> 03:39.928
they both died less than 24 hours
after their first vision.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.765
And I just saw that goddamn clock, so…

03:43.848 --> 03:45.391
[Max breathes shakily]

03:46.643 --> 03:48.686
…looks like I'm gonna die tomorrow.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.772
[distant clang]

03:53.399 --> 03:54.359
Stay here.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.406

04:25.640 --> 04:26.808
[all yelling]

04:29.519 --> 04:30.979
-It's me!
-Lucas?

04:31.062 --> 04:33.106
-It's me.
-Jesus, what's wrong with you?

04:33.189 --> 04:36.192
-I'm sorry.
-I could've taken you out with this lamp!

04:36.276 --> 04:37.986
[panting] Sorry, guys. Sorry.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.363
I was… I was biking for eight miles.

04:40.989 --> 04:41.906
[grunts, pants]

04:41.990 --> 04:44.909
[panting] Give me a second. Shit.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.287
-We've got a code red.
-What?

04:47.370 --> 04:48.454
[intense music playing]

04:48.538 --> 04:49.539
Dustin.

04:50.790 --> 04:54.085
I've been with Jason, Patrick, and Andy,
and they've gone totally off the rails.

04:54.168 --> 04:57.922
They're trying to capture Eddie,
and they think you know where he is.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.383
You're in terrible danger.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.510
All right. Yeah, that definitely sucks,

05:02.593 --> 05:04.929
but we've got bigger problems
than Jason now.

05:05.013 --> 05:07.056
[clock chiming]

05:07.140 --> 05:09.142

[doorbell rings]

06:21.214 --> 06:23.716
-[Mrs. Sinclair] Would you get the door?
-I'm busy!

06:23.800 --> 06:25.885
[Mrs. Sinclair] I said get the door.

06:25.968 --> 06:27.595
This is unbelievable.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.433
Hey there. Is, uh, is Lucas home?

06:32.517 --> 06:33.643
Negative.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.353
You know where he is? [chuckles]

06:35.853 --> 06:38.564
Uh, we're just…
We were supposed to go out and--

06:38.648 --> 06:41.526
Go out? I see he's taken
a step down from Max.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.486
-[door slams]
-[menacing music playing]

06:43.569 --> 06:45.738
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

06:46.572 --> 06:50.701
Uh, well, you're the little sister
who plays Dungeons & Dragons, huh?

06:50.785 --> 06:51.911
What's it to you?

06:51.994 --> 06:54.080
Do you know Dustin Henderson?

06:54.163 --> 06:56.040
Know him? I've bled with him.

06:56.124 --> 06:58.709
Chances are,
he's with your cheater boyfriend.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.504
Oh, if and when you do find Lucas,

07:02.213 --> 07:05.383
please tell him I've been
covering for his ass for two days now.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.969
Each day of covering
costs ten bucks, with a DPR.

07:08.052 --> 07:11.139
That's a daily percentage rate of 7.9%.

07:11.222 --> 07:14.642
Another week of this
and he's buying me a goddamn Nintendo,

07:14.725 --> 07:16.060
with Duck Hunt.

07:18.062 --> 07:19.397
Where the hell's Sinclair?

07:19.480 --> 07:21.315
That's what we're about to find out.

07:21.816 --> 07:23.192
We've been tricked, boys.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.278
[tires screech]

07:28.990 --> 07:30.032
[Steve grumbles]

07:30.116 --> 07:32.452
Okay, be honest. Uh…

07:33.119 --> 07:34.745
You guys understand any of this?

07:34.829 --> 07:36.330
-No.
-Pretty straightforward.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.748
Oh, straightforward, really?

07:37.832 --> 07:39.125
What's confusing to you?

07:39.208 --> 07:41.335
So far, everyone Vecna
has cursed has died,

07:41.419 --> 07:43.880
except for this old Victor Creel dude
Nancy found.

07:43.963 --> 07:45.423
He's the only known survivor.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.467
If anyone knows
how to beat this curse, it's him.

07:47.550 --> 07:50.386
That's assuming he was cursed,
which we don't even know.

07:51.012 --> 07:53.890
How can Vecna have existed in the '50s?
It doesn't make sense.

07:53.973 --> 07:57.018
Far as we know,
Eleven didn't create the Upside Down.

07:57.101 --> 07:58.436
She opened a gate to it.

07:58.519 --> 08:01.898
The Upside Down has probably been around
for thousands of years. Millions.

08:01.981 --> 08:04.066
I wouldn't be surprised
if it predated the dinosaurs.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.943
-Dinosaurs? What are we--
-[Lucas] Okay.

08:06.027 --> 08:09.822
But if a gate didn't exist in the '50s,
how did Vecna get through?

08:09.906 --> 08:12.116
-How's he getting through now?
-[Lucas] And why now?

08:12.200 --> 08:13.826
And why then? Just pops out in the '50s,

08:13.910 --> 08:16.078
kills one family,
and he's like, "I'm good."

08:16.162 --> 08:18.414
And poof, he just disappears. Just… gone?

08:18.498 --> 08:20.875
Only to return 30 years later
and start killing random teens?

08:20.958 --> 08:21.918
No, I don't buy it.

08:22.001 --> 08:23.085
[exhales, sighs]

08:23.169 --> 08:24.378
Straightforward, my ass.

08:24.462 --> 08:28.424
Honestly, Henderson, a little humility
now and then, it wouldn't hurt you.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.467
Sorry.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.140
[delicate, intense music playing]

08:39.852 --> 08:41.270
Any idea what she's writing?

08:45.274 --> 08:46.526
[Dustin] Did she sleep?

08:47.109 --> 08:47.944
I mean,

08:49.737 --> 08:50.613
would you?

08:51.113 --> 08:52.156
[door opens]

08:52.240 --> 08:53.699
[footsteps descending stairs]

08:56.118 --> 08:57.203
Okay, so…

08:57.703 --> 08:59.705
-[Robin sighs]
-…we have a plan.

08:59.789 --> 09:00.873
[music continues]

09:00.957 --> 09:02.375
[Robin] Thanks to Nancy's minions,

09:02.458 --> 09:05.711
we are now rock-star psychology students
at the University of Notre Dame.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.338
-I'm now Ruth.
-And I'm Rose.

09:07.421 --> 09:08.965
Ruth?

09:10.675 --> 09:11.801
Nice GPA.

09:11.884 --> 09:12.802
[Nancy] Thanks.

09:12.885 --> 09:16.472
So we called Pennhurst Asylum,
told them we'd like to speak with Creel

09:16.556 --> 09:18.766
for a thesis we're co-writing
on paranoid schizophrenics--

09:18.849 --> 09:19.767
To which they said no.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.686
But we landed
a three o'clock with the director.

09:21.769 --> 09:25.773
Now all we have to do is charm him
and convince him to let us talk to Victor.

09:25.856 --> 09:27.942
Then maybe we can rid Max of this curse.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.610
[Steve] About that.

09:29.694 --> 09:32.280
We've been doing
our Victor Creel homework, and, uh…

09:32.363 --> 09:34.490
[sighs] …we got some questions.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.658
Lots of questions.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.910
So do we.
Hopefully, Victor has the answers.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.870
Wait… Wait… Wait a second. Uh…

09:41.622 --> 09:42.498
Where's mine?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.584
[dramatic music builds, halts]

09:45.209 --> 09:47.795
Nancy, you're outta your mind
if you think I'm babysitting again.

09:47.878 --> 09:50.881
First, they're not babies anymore.
And Max is in real danger.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.593
-She needs people around her.
-I know. But why me?

09:53.676 --> 09:56.178
Oh my God, you have a Tom Cruise poster.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.139
You have a Tom Cruise poster.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.307
That's old.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.725
-It's just…
-[Robin laughs]

10:00.808 --> 10:04.270
-Can you please not touch anything?
-I can't do anything here, Nance.

10:04.353 --> 10:07.023
Maybe I can be helpful
with this asylum director dude.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.358
I don't know.
I could turn on my… my charm.

10:09.442 --> 10:11.193
-Not the charm we need.
-Ouch.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.445
No, I just… [sighs]

10:12.528 --> 10:15.948
I did a little digging last night,
and it turns out this Dr. Hatch

10:16.032 --> 10:19.660
is a distinguished fellow
of the American Psychiatric Association

10:19.744 --> 10:21.871
and a Harvard visiting scholar, okay?

10:21.954 --> 10:24.999
This is a lifelong student of the world.
If we're gonna win him over,

10:25.082 --> 10:27.251
we're gonna have to convince him
we are too.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.586
That, like him…

10:28.669 --> 10:31.672
-[music box playing]
-…we are true academic scholars.

10:32.256 --> 10:34.842
[whispers] Holy shit.
There's a little ballerina in here.

10:37.553 --> 10:41.182
Academic scholar? She's giving you
an academic scholar vibe? Yeah.

10:41.265 --> 10:43.726
-No, but…
-[Robyn sighs]

10:43.809 --> 10:44.894
…she will.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.814
Oh, please, tell me you're joking.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.942
[truck horn blares]

10:52.026 --> 10:54.028
[Joyce] It's busy. It's still busy.

10:54.111 --> 10:58.783
Did I do something wrong?
It says dial one, then the number, which--

10:58.866 --> 11:02.578
-You can check on your kids later.
-I don't understand why it's still busy.

11:02.662 --> 11:06.374
Joyce, there are certain things
one can be late to in life.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.958
A dentist's appointment.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.544
A one-year-old's birthday party,
because who cares?

11:10.628 --> 11:12.129
Little idiot's not gonna remember it.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.591
But for what is essentially
a ransom exchange,

11:15.675 --> 11:18.969
for that, for that,
I think you very much need to be

11:19.053 --> 11:20.805
on time.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.684
I'm sorry. I'm very tense.

11:24.767 --> 11:25.935
Clearly.

11:28.896 --> 11:31.607
[grandiose Russian music playing]

11:38.531 --> 11:40.157
[music continues over speakers]

11:40.908 --> 11:41.909
[dog barking]

11:43.411 --> 11:46.914
[Antonov] Head west, through forest.
You will see a church with a gray roof.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.375
Wait inside. Yuri will meet you there.

11:50.292 --> 11:51.627
So you heard from her?

11:52.628 --> 11:54.422
Yeah, they arrived last night.

11:54.922 --> 11:56.465
They're meeting Yuri soon.

11:56.549 --> 11:59.635
If all goes well,
by tomorrow night you're home,

11:59.719 --> 12:01.595
eating Enzo's with your sexy woman.

12:01.679 --> 12:02.930
She's not my woman.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.351
Of course not.
She saves your life because of friendship.

12:07.435 --> 12:08.853
[guard speaks in Russian]

12:09.437 --> 12:11.021
[Antonov] Look, American,

12:11.105 --> 12:13.524
do not put too much hope into this dream.

12:13.607 --> 12:15.484
I have thought long about this,

12:15.568 --> 12:17.570
and I give you odds of success

12:18.654 --> 12:19.822
fifty to one.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.907
[tense music playing]

12:23.492 --> 12:26.245
You don't even seem nervous, American.
I'm impressed.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.247
You're a cool cat.

12:28.914 --> 12:31.417
Like Steve McQueen. The Cooler King. Yeah?

12:31.500 --> 12:33.377
-[chuckles]
-Let's hope not.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.298
Of course not,
because Cooler King went back to cooler.

12:37.798 --> 12:40.551
So, you must be better than McQueen today.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.470
I change mind.

12:42.970 --> 12:44.555
Now I give you odds

12:45.556 --> 12:46.682
a hundred to one.

12:48.684 --> 12:51.604
Our nosy friend again.
Where do you want it?

12:51.687 --> 12:53.189
Just not my face.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.442
Of course not.
Must be pretty for your woman.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.903
She's not my woman. [grunts]

13:33.103 --> 13:36.440
[announcer in English] Amazing you can get
this many people and have it this quiet.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.193
Keep in mind that…

13:39.276 --> 13:40.486
Where are you going?

13:41.153 --> 13:43.447
[scoffs] I'm just getting something
to drink.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.492
Is that allowed or…
How does this house arrest work?

13:46.575 --> 13:47.576
You're not under arrest.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.494
Right.

13:49.119 --> 13:51.539
No, no, you're… you're here to protect us.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.251
And watch TV, apparently.

[sighs] I… I mean, I don't think
they've thought this through.

14:25.614 --> 14:29.285
If this goes on for a month, or months,
and people can't get a hold of us,

14:29.368 --> 14:31.078
they're gonna totally freak out.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.664
Meanwhile, my mom's
probably having a panic attack.

14:33.747 --> 14:34.915
And what about Hawkins?

14:34.999 --> 14:37.001
That lady's supposed
to keep it "contained."

14:37.084 --> 14:40.379
Like you can contain any of this
without El. I mean…

14:41.171 --> 14:42.047
Yeah.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.425
[sighs]

14:44.508 --> 14:47.511
If you keep staring at that,
it's not gonna change. You know?

14:49.597 --> 14:52.099
-Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

15:01.567 --> 15:02.818
Before the cops came,

15:02.902 --> 15:05.613
me and El, we… we had a bad fight.

15:06.363 --> 15:07.364
We never fight.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.782
I mean, we fought before,

15:08.866 --> 15:11.035
but just, like,
silly fights, stupid fights.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.664
But, I don't know,
this one just felt more adult.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.583
Like, it… it just felt more real.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.836
Like, a fight you can't come back from.

15:22.338 --> 15:25.299
Maybe I should've said something,
and if I would've said that thing,

15:25.382 --> 15:28.260
then maybe she'd want me there with her,
wherever she is.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.554
No. Look, Mike,

15:31.180 --> 15:32.556
you're gonna see her again,

15:32.640 --> 15:35.476
and whatever you didn't say,
you can say it to her then.

15:36.644 --> 15:37.561
Okay?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.521
Yeah. Yeah.

15:40.731 --> 15:41.982
She's gonna be okay.

15:42.066 --> 15:45.527
She's not in Hawkins.
That's what we should be worrying about.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.237
You don't trust Owens?

15:47.321 --> 15:48.656
No. I don't know.

15:48.739 --> 15:49.823
I mean,

15:49.907 --> 15:51.867
he's been good to us and good to El,

15:51.951 --> 15:53.911
but he wasn't able to protect me.

15:54.536 --> 15:56.372
That was you guys who saved me.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.539
That was you guys.

it's gonna be up to us again.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.590
[laughs]

we can't stay here.

[determined synth music playing]

16:12.346 --> 16:13.180
Listen,

16:14.139 --> 16:17.393
let's assume these friends of Owens
are telling the truth.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.895
We can't call Hawkins
without alerting the military,

16:19.979 --> 16:21.480
putting El in danger.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.399
Fine. Then we'll just go to them.

16:23.482 --> 16:25.317
-Go to Hawkins?
-How?

16:25.401 --> 16:28.070
What are you worried about?
Ponch and Jon out there?

16:28.153 --> 16:29.738
They're half-asleep now watching golf.

16:29.822 --> 16:32.616
No, Jonathan. I mean,
we don't have a car or money.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.410
Then we'll hail ourselves a ride.

16:35.369 --> 16:36.453
A cheap one.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.046
What?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.256
We're hungry.

16:51.885 --> 16:52.886
I could eat.

at Surfer Boy except for our pineapple,

17:09.278 --> 17:10.529
which comes from a can.

17:10.612 --> 17:14.283
But I still highly recommend slapping
some juicy pineapple on your pie.

Oh, fruit on your pizza's gnarly, you say?

17:16.660 --> 17:19.288

boring into the back of my head

And, um, you.

Oh, and, um,
give these to Mike, El, and Will.

If you can ever get a hold of them again.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.724
What are you doing? No, don't.
That's not for now. Don't open it now.

It's, um…

18:27.981 --> 18:28.899

18:36.990 --> 18:37.825
No!

18:38.450 --> 18:42.037
No, I don't need you to reassure me
and tell me it's all gonna work out.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.874
People have been telling me that
my entire life and it's almost never true.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.752
It's never true.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.255
I mean, of course this asshole curses me.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.784
Seriously, I'm not joking.
I'm not driving you anywhere.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.829
If you think I'm going to spend
what is likely the last day of my life

19:23.912 --> 19:26.165
in the armpit
that is Mike Wheeler's basement,

19:26.248 --> 19:27.249
you're out of your mind.

19:27.332 --> 19:29.751
Either take me where I need to go
or tie me down,

19:29.835 --> 19:31.753
which is technically
kidnapping of a minor.

19:31.837 --> 19:35.632
And if I live to see another day, Steve,
I swear to God, I will prosecute.

[Robin grunting]

20:30.520 --> 20:34.191
I can't breathe in this thing,
and I'm itchy. I'm itching all over.

20:34.274 --> 20:36.151
It's not all about comfort.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.402
Okay? We're academics.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.696
Who are evidently coming
straight from Easter brunch.

20:39.780 --> 20:43.533
Also, this bra that you gave me
is really pinching my boobs.

20:43.617 --> 20:47.663
Okay. Could you just let me
do the talking? If that's even possible?

20:47.746 --> 20:49.873
It's not only possible, it's inevitable.

20:49.957 --> 20:52.626
Because shortly,
I'll be dead from strangulation.

20:56.546 --> 20:57.547
Both of you.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.467
Impressive.

21:00.550 --> 21:03.929
And this is a recommendation
from Professor Brantley.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.557
Yeah, I know Larry. Quite well, actually.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.310
Eh, you know what they say.

[Robin, Hatch chuckling]

21:16.441 --> 21:21.363
Uh, yes, yes,
that's actually why we're here.

21:21.863 --> 21:24.825
I mean, we can only
learn so much in a classroom.

21:24.908 --> 21:25.742
Mmm.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.662
And I'm sympathetic
to your struggle, truly.

21:29.663 --> 21:32.541
But there is a protocol
to visiting a patient like Victor.

21:33.041 --> 21:34.167
You put in a request

21:34.751 --> 21:36.712
and then undergo a screening process,

21:36.795 --> 21:39.089
at which point
the board will make a decision.

21:42.175 --> 21:43.385
I can see you're disappointed.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.803
[Hatch inhales]

21:44.886 --> 21:47.139
But I'm more than happy
to give you a tour.

21:47.222 --> 21:50.892
Perhaps you can even speak
to some patients in our low-security wing.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.895
And we'd… we would love that.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.523
It's just that, um… [clicks tongue]

21:56.606 --> 21:59.234
…our thesis is due next month.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.986
And you're out of time.

22:01.069 --> 22:02.112
Whose fault is that?

22:02.195 --> 22:04.031
Ours. Absolutely.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.824
And I do apologize--

22:05.907 --> 22:08.243
Don't apologize, Ruth. Screw that.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.538
The fact is, we did put in a request
months ago and were denied.

22:11.621 --> 22:14.082
And then we reapplied
and were denied again.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.461
And coming here was
our last-ditch effort to save our thesis.

22:17.544 --> 22:20.339
And I really…
I can't breathe in this thing.

22:20.422 --> 22:23.383
Well, Rose, maybe you'd like
to go outside and get some air.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.385
-Maybe I should, Ruth.
-Mm-hmm.

22:25.469 --> 22:28.972
Because I'm starting to think
this whole thing is a colossal mistake.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.891
I'm breaking out in a rash.

22:30.974 --> 22:33.560
My boobs hurt.
And I'll tell you the truth, Anthony.

22:33.643 --> 22:36.063
May I call you Anthony?
These aren't my clothes.

22:36.146 --> 22:39.566
I borrowed them
because I wanted you to take us seriously.

22:39.649 --> 22:42.986
Because nobody takes girls seriously
in this field. They just don't.

22:43.070 --> 22:46.656
We don't look the part or whatever.
But can I tell you a story?

22:46.740 --> 22:49.159
-[inspirational music playing]
-1978, I was at summer camp.

22:49.242 --> 22:52.454
And my counselor Drew
told me and everyone in Cabin C

22:52.537 --> 22:55.082
the true story
of the Victor Creel Massacre.

22:55.165 --> 22:58.126
And little Petey McHew…
You know Petey, right, Ruth?

22:58.210 --> 22:59.044
Of… Of course.

22:59.127 --> 23:03.507
Yeah. Little Petey McHew
started sobbing right there on the spot.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.384
Full-on hyperventilating.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.427
The other campers
