* MTV. *

00:15.049 --> 00:17.285
* *

00:22.090 --> 00:23.657
(alarm ringing)

00:25.359 --> 00:27.461
* *

00:36.137 --> 00:37.671
(exhales)

00:39.006 --> 00:40.674
INFLUENCER (over video):
Cred has more electrolytes

00:40.774 --> 00:42.676
than Gatorade or Prime.

00:42.776 --> 00:46.780
And now Cred has a new flavor:
Cherry Bubblegum.

00:57.024 --> 00:59.493
Eric, do you really need
to bring three bottles

00:59.593 --> 01:01.162
of that drink to school?

01:01.262 --> 01:04.332
Mom, a kid today is defined
by their hydration drink.

01:04.432 --> 01:07.735
I have to have more Cred
than anyone else.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.403
* *

01:09.503 --> 01:11.239
* I got Cred, bitches *

01:11.339 --> 01:12.906
* I got Cred *

01:13.006 --> 01:14.742
* I got Cred, bitches *

01:14.842 --> 01:16.610
* I got Cred *

01:16.710 --> 01:18.412
* I got Kiwi Lime *

01:18.512 --> 01:19.813
* I got Gooble Grape *

01:19.913 --> 01:21.782
* You got no Cred, bitches *

01:21.882 --> 01:23.617
* But I got mine *

01:27.955 --> 01:30.591
* We got Cred, bitches,
we got Cred *

01:30.691 --> 01:32.493
* Our teeth are blue, bitches *

01:32.593 --> 01:34.628
* Our tongues are red... *

01:34.728 --> 01:35.929
CARTMAN:
Yeah, but it's, like, seriously,

01:36.029 --> 01:37.565
look at how it's suddenly
everybody now.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.167
Like that Spencer Hollis kid.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.601
He never even cared about Cred,

01:40.701 --> 01:42.035
he just drinks it
'cause some stupid influencer

01:42.136 --> 01:43.371
said it's cool now.

01:43.471 --> 01:45.473
Hey, hey, Clyde,
where's your Cred?

01:46.574 --> 01:50.010
Oh, um, it's in my...
I-I already drank it.

01:51.345 --> 01:52.946
See? That's what
I'm talking about.

01:53.046 --> 01:55.316
Clyde likes Cred so much that
he drank all his before noon.

01:55.416 --> 01:56.584
That's a real Cred drinker.

01:56.684 --> 01:59.086
Unlike all the poser
Cred drinkers

01:59.187 --> 02:00.688
like Spencer Hollis!

02:00.788 --> 02:02.022
Fuck you.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.758
Fuck you, Spencer,
you're a fucking poser!

02:04.858 --> 02:07.161
STRONG WOMAN:
It's literally everywhere now.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.797
These crazy hydration drinks
that say they're healthy,

02:09.897 --> 02:12.900
but are loaded with fake sugars
and not safe for children.

02:13.000 --> 02:16.204
Why now? Why are kids
suddenly so into these things?

02:16.304 --> 02:17.738
Online influencers.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.840
They promote this stuff to kids
to make money.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.142
I don't know what kind of
scumbags would push adult things

02:22.243 --> 02:25.145
-on something they know
kids will watch.
-(pounding on door)

02:25.246 --> 02:28.382
You guys, we have a big problem.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.318
-What is it?
-It's about the South Park

02:30.418 --> 02:32.186
elementary art teacher.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.687
Mrs. Streibel? What about her?

02:33.787 --> 02:36.890
We just found out
that she's been...

02:36.990 --> 02:40.361
doing pornographic videos
on OnlyFans.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.430
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.165
There's gonna be
a big meeting tonight,

02:45.266 --> 02:48.101
and everybody's gonna see it.

02:48.202 --> 02:50.438
* *

03:03.984 --> 03:06.019
* *

03:27.241 --> 03:29.677
(indistinct shouting)

03:29.777 --> 03:31.912
Everyone, let's try
to be civil here.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.282
Be civil?
How are we supposed to go home

03:34.382 --> 03:37.084
and explain to our children that
their art teacher is a slut?

03:37.184 --> 03:38.252
(agreeing chatter)

03:38.352 --> 03:40.321
She is not a slut.

03:40.421 --> 03:43.724
Mrs. Streibel is a woman
engaging in a legal activity

03:43.824 --> 03:47.027
on a website
that is for adults only.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.396
(angry shouting)

03:48.496 --> 03:50.097
Of course kids are gonna see it.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.433
-They see everything
on the Internet.
-(agreeing chatter)

03:52.533 --> 03:55.969
Well, the problem is you guys
buy your kids phones, okay?

03:56.069 --> 03:59.407
Just like you buy them all these
unhealthy hydration drinks.

03:59.507 --> 04:01.141
Oh, don't turn this
around on us.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.110
We can't control
what our kids drink

04:03.210 --> 04:04.278
or what they watch.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.946
They're your kids.

04:06.046 --> 04:08.081
Many teachers
are struggling to get by

04:08.181 --> 04:10.418
and need ways to supplement
their income.

04:10.518 --> 04:13.321
Mrs. Streibel makes close
to minimum wage as a teacher,

04:13.421 --> 04:17.525
but on OnlyFans, she makes
an extra $10,000 a week.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.961
(indistinct shouting)

04:21.061 --> 04:22.796
It doesn't matter
how much she made,

04:22.896 --> 04:25.333
we're talking about someone
who influences our children.

04:25.433 --> 04:27.535
Did she say $10,000 a week?

04:27.635 --> 04:29.537
Listen, we have suspended

04:29.637 --> 04:31.939
Mrs. Streibel indefinitely,
okay?

04:32.039 --> 04:33.807
But over the next few days,

04:33.907 --> 04:35.776
you should probably talk
to your kids

04:35.876 --> 04:40.548
about what they might
have seen, m'kay.

04:51.158 --> 04:56.229
Uh, hey, Clyde, w-why don't you
come over here and have a seat?

04:56.330 --> 04:57.765
What?

04:57.865 --> 05:00.601
Uh, have a seat, pal.
We need to talk to you.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.236
Clyde...

05:03.337 --> 05:05.406
we're understanding
that some tough things

05:05.506 --> 05:07.341
have been going on at school.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.910
Yes. Yes, they have.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.245
All right, well, we know
that some of the stuff

05:12.346 --> 05:15.583
you're dealing with
might be kind of disturbing.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.818
Yes, it's totally disturbing,
yes.

05:17.918 --> 05:21.455
All right, Clyde, well,
we want to try and help you.

05:21.555 --> 05:22.656
Really? You do?

05:22.756 --> 05:24.492
Oh, thank God. Finally.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.827
Yeah, pal,
let-let me explain to you

05:26.927 --> 05:29.363
what "double penetration" is.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.699
Double penetration?

05:31.799 --> 05:33.867
See, in your art teacher's
OnlyFans page,

05:33.967 --> 05:37.505
her and two men,
who love each other very much,

05:37.605 --> 05:39.973
wanted to express that love...

05:40.073 --> 05:41.875
Dad, nobody cares
about double penetration.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.144
My life at school is awful
because you don't let me drink

05:44.244 --> 05:46.480
hydrating sports drinks
like all the other kids.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.382
Clyde, we've told you,
those things are filled

05:48.482 --> 05:49.817
with additives and fake sugar,

05:49.917 --> 05:51.585
and they're not good
for children.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.853
You're not even
my real mom, Janice,

05:52.953 --> 05:54.588
so why don't you
shut the fuck up?

05:54.688 --> 05:56.189
Clyde, that's enough.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.091
Every other kid at school
is allowed to have it.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.860
They all have Cred,
but I have zero Cred

05:59.960 --> 06:01.395
because my dad
and his stupid girlfriend

06:01.495 --> 06:02.796
think it's bad for me.

06:02.896 --> 06:05.065
Why do you want to be
like all the other kids?

06:05.165 --> 06:07.100
Shut up, Janice,
you're not my mom!

06:07.200 --> 06:08.969
All right, Clyde, we're trying
to have a nice talk with you

06:09.069 --> 06:10.237
about double penetration,

06:10.337 --> 06:12.105
and you can just go
to your room now.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.407
Fine!

06:14.241 --> 06:15.909
Thanks a lot
for making sure your son

06:16.009 --> 06:19.246
is the only kid in school
without any Cred!

06:25.553 --> 06:28.989
INFLUENCER (over video):
It's like nobody
understands me, you know?

06:29.089 --> 06:31.124
Like, all these stupid boomers
and people over 40

06:31.224 --> 06:33.661
don't know how hard it is
for young people.

06:33.761 --> 06:35.496
-Yeah.
-Like, yo, if you guys

06:35.596 --> 06:37.565
feel the same way,
just leave a comment down below

06:37.665 --> 06:39.366
and smash that like button.

06:39.467 --> 06:43.837
You know, the most important
thing is just to be yourself.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.839
And when I feel like
I can't be myself,

06:45.939 --> 06:48.709
that's when I need a hydration
drink that'll pick me up.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.545
-That's when I need Cred.
-(groans)

06:51.645 --> 06:54.247
INFLUENCER:
It's the coolest sports drink
in the world.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.316
Cred is 100% sugar-free.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.086
Cred has electrolytes
so you can ride your bike.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.721
And also,
Cred has more vitamin A

07:00.821 --> 07:03.023
than your body
could possibly ever use.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.958
I can't feel my face.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.227
Drink Cred
or you're a piece of shit.

07:07.327 --> 07:08.562
(whoops)

07:08.662 --> 07:10.798
NARRATOR:
Drink Cred at your school today.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.903
Hey, guys, I know there's
a lot of influencers out there

07:16.003 --> 07:17.571
trying to get your attention.

07:17.671 --> 07:20.040
And I just hope that
you'll maybe take a moment

07:20.140 --> 07:24.411
to check out what I have to say
here on My OnlyFans page.

07:24.512 --> 07:27.815
I hope you're all doing great,
and if you're watching this PPV,

07:27.915 --> 07:29.750
I hope you'll consider
subscribing.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.251
If you want me
to give a shout-out

07:31.351 --> 07:33.120
for your social media,
I can do that.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.855
And if you want a custom,
just let me know

07:34.955 --> 07:36.356
if there's anything special
you want to see.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.759
-What the fuck are you doing?
-Oh! Hey, Sharon,

07:38.859 --> 07:40.460
just supplementing my income.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.129
Are you serious right now?

07:42.229 --> 07:44.998
All right, all right,
Sharon, yes,

07:45.098 --> 07:47.100
I am an OnlyFans model.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.802
And I'm not ashamed of it.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.504
Goddamn it, Randy.

07:50.604 --> 07:53.907
What is with all the stigma
Americans have anyway, huh?

07:54.007 --> 07:56.476
It's just my penis, Sharon.
It's not a big deal.

07:56.577 --> 07:59.479
No, it's definitely
not a big deal.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.048
Okay, good. Thank you.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.883
All I'm doing
is taking back control

08:02.983 --> 08:04.985
of my sexuality on a platform

08:05.085 --> 08:06.920
that I can benefit from
financially.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.622
So you're just gonna sit here
and jack off

08:08.722 --> 08:11.625
for four hours a week just
to make a few extra dollars?

08:11.725 --> 08:13.827
I jack off
two hours a week anyways.

08:13.927 --> 08:15.529
Now I just do it
a little bit more

08:15.629 --> 08:18.265
and make enough money to pay
for the increase in gas prices.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.568
If your children find out
about this,

08:20.668 --> 08:22.936
they are going to leave home.

08:23.704 --> 08:26.640
Children aren't allowed
on OnlyFans, Sharon.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.508
It's totally safe.

08:28.609 --> 08:31.011
Kids aren't gonna see this.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.915
(school bell ringing)

08:36.083 --> 08:38.786
(indistinct chatter)

08:40.921 --> 08:42.956
Hey, Butters, Tweek,
you guys got a second?

08:43.056 --> 08:44.825
-For what?
-Okay, you know how, like,

08:44.925 --> 08:46.159
some kids in this school
really like Cred

08:46.259 --> 08:47.561
and others just pretend to,

08:47.661 --> 08:49.329
but really they're posers
like Spencer Hollis?

08:49.429 --> 08:51.965
Well, I think we should
start a Cred affinity group.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.400
What's an affinity group?

08:53.500 --> 08:55.268
It's where you, like,
divide people into groups

08:55.368 --> 08:57.437
and single them out in order
to make other people feel bad.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.439
See, it's like
we're the legit Cred drinkers,

08:59.539 --> 09:00.808
and we should just let
the very coolest kids

09:00.908 --> 09:01.975
into our affinity group.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.376
Oh, hey, Clyde.

09:03.476 --> 09:05.178
-Where's your Cred?
-Oh, it's just, uh...

09:05.278 --> 09:08.115
-it's, uh, in my backpack again.
-Oh, that's cool.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.950
You guys think we should let
Clyde into our affinity group?

09:10.050 --> 09:11.551
Yeah, I like Clyde.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.787
Oh, hey, Stan. Do you want
to be in our affinity group?

09:13.887 --> 09:16.223
-What's an affinity group?
-It's like where people separate

09:16.323 --> 09:17.891
into little clubs by, like,
skin color or religious beliefs

09:17.991 --> 09:19.660
and talk about how much better
they are than everyone else.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.328
Usually, white people
can't be in an affinity group,

09:21.428 --> 09:22.863
but it's for a drink,
so they have to let us.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.632
That's not what
an affinity group is.

09:24.732 --> 09:27.000
Uh, yeah, well,
no one's inviting you, Kyle.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.902
'Cause it looks like
you don't even have any Cred.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.771
Yeah, I do, it's in my backpack.

09:30.871 --> 09:33.006
Oh, sure,
it's in his backpack, guys.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.642
Yeah, let's see it, then.

09:34.742 --> 09:37.678
It's right here. We drink
way more Cred than you guys do.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.180
Oh, yeah, right. Tweek drinks
four bottles of Cred

09:40.280 --> 09:42.683
-for breakfast.
-(grunting)

09:42.783 --> 09:44.517
(school bell rings)

09:44.618 --> 09:46.086
I don't want to be a part
of any affinity group.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.554
It just sounds like trouble.

09:47.655 --> 09:48.989
Yeah, well, we don't want you.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.523
'Cause you just pretend
to like Cred

09:50.624 --> 09:51.959
'cause it's a fad right now

09:52.059 --> 09:53.560
like all the other lame-o's
in this school.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.228
Hey, guys.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.831
Hey, Clyde, you got a sec?

09:57.931 --> 10:00.300
-For what?
-I was just gonna talk to you
about your backpack.

10:00.400 --> 10:02.335
-W-What about my backpack?
-Well, it's just...

10:02.435 --> 10:04.104
You know, it's really best
to have a backpack

10:04.204 --> 10:05.939
that's got a water bottle pouch
to put your Cred in.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.340
See, like, see how
y-you can see, like,

10:07.440 --> 10:09.142
you can see my Cred bottle
from the outside?

10:09.242 --> 10:10.377
You just go like this,
and everyone-everyone

10:10.477 --> 10:11.845
can see your Cred?
You're just like,

10:11.945 --> 10:13.080
"Oh, hey, what's going on?

10:13.180 --> 10:14.014
"Oh, yeah, sweet,
check out my Cred.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.849
It's, like, right here."

10:15.949 --> 10:17.785
Um, well, I-I don't think

10:17.885 --> 10:19.419
I can get a new backpack
till my birthday.

10:19.519 --> 10:21.288
Well, maybe just, like,
use some tape or something

10:21.388 --> 10:22.756
to make your own bottle pouch?

10:22.856 --> 10:24.024
You know, we definitely
don't want you to look

10:24.124 --> 10:25.492
like you don't have any Cred.

10:25.592 --> 10:26.994
(chuckles) All right,
see you in class, brah.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.364
* *

10:40.908 --> 10:42.976
RANDY:
Hey, Sharon. Can we talk?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.377
* *

10:44.477 --> 10:46.346
I feel like there's
a lot bad things going on

10:46.446 --> 10:49.549
in the world, and it gets so
confusing sometimes, you know?

10:49.649 --> 10:53.520
I think, as Americans, we watch
news about things happening

10:53.620 --> 10:56.523
in the Middle East and we just
don't want to get involved.

10:56.623 --> 10:58.658
And I know it can feel like
"What can I do?

10:58.759 --> 11:01.528
I'm not special, how could I
ever make a difference?"

11:01.628 --> 11:04.932
But we can't let ourselves
think like that.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.100
Sometimes what it takes

11:07.200 --> 11:09.703
is just one person
to start a movement.

11:09.803 --> 11:13.573
One person, and then
everyone else might follow.

11:16.910 --> 11:22.349
I am not subscribing
to your OnlyFans page, Randy.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.418
Okay, well, you're a cunt.

11:28.621 --> 11:30.657
(indistinct chatter)

11:32.826 --> 11:34.161
Yeah, that looks good.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.596
Maybe a little higher
on your side, Butters.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.799
Yeah, that's great. I think
everyone can see that now.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.401
That should definitely
make people feel unwelcome.

11:42.169 --> 11:44.404
* *

11:59.719 --> 12:01.488
(playful chattering)

12:12.499 --> 12:13.967
Hey.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.836
Hey...

12:15.936 --> 12:17.604
What's goin' on?

12:17.704 --> 12:21.441
So... are you, like,
selling Cred?

12:21.541 --> 12:24.011
What? Selling hydration drinks
on school grounds

12:24.111 --> 12:25.678
is against the rules.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.247
Come here, come here.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.550
What the-- Hey, what are you--
What the hell are you doing?

12:30.650 --> 12:33.854
(quietly):
If you're wearing a wire,
I will kick your ass.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.456
Bro, I'm not wearing a wire!
Do you have Cred or not?

12:36.556 --> 12:39.392
Sure, I got Cred.
What are ya looking for?

12:39.492 --> 12:42.162
A little...
Watermelon Strawberry?

12:42.262 --> 12:43.330
No, no, do you have any ones

12:43.430 --> 12:44.932
that don't taste like total ass?

12:45.032 --> 12:46.299
Oh, you want the good shit.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.568
I got your Bubblegum Grape
right here.

12:48.668 --> 12:49.903
Okay, how much?

12:50.003 --> 12:51.138
Eighty bucks.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.473
$80? For a shitty
fake-sugar drink?

12:53.573 --> 12:54.842
What do you think
I'm runnin' here,

12:54.942 --> 12:56.609
a fucking charity
for the homeless?

12:56.709 --> 12:58.946
How about some
Oatmeal Nummy Nums?

12:59.046 --> 13:00.814
I can get you into that for $65.

13:00.914 --> 13:04.784
I don't have $65.
What can I get for three bucks?

13:04.885 --> 13:06.553
Three bucks? Oh, sure.

13:06.653 --> 13:08.688
For that, you can get
an empty Cred bottle.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.258
-What good is that gonna do me?
-It's easy.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.393
You just fill
your empty bottle with water,

13:13.493 --> 13:15.095
add a little food coloring.

13:15.195 --> 13:19.299
Everyone thinks you got Cred
when you actually have no Cred.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.469
I'm not giving you three dollars
for just plastic garbage!

13:22.569 --> 13:23.904
Cool thing, man.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.739
You just go back into the school
without any Cred at all.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.641
See how long you last.

13:29.910 --> 13:31.411
Here!

13:33.280 --> 13:34.982
RANDY:
Hey, guys, it's your boy Randy,

13:35.082 --> 13:37.885
and in this video we're doing
authentic pad Thai

13:37.985 --> 13:39.652
for under $6.

13:39.752 --> 13:41.821
Now we're gonna start
with some medium shrimp

13:41.922 --> 13:43.390
and some rice noodles.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.458
For the wet ingredients,
we're looking at a couple eggs,

13:45.558 --> 13:47.094
some fish and also soy sauce.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.196
And then for garnish, we're
gonna do a little cilantro,

13:49.296 --> 13:50.730
green onion, and then of course,

13:50.830 --> 13:53.800
we're gonna top that all off
with some fresh nuts.

13:53.901 --> 13:56.203
Those nuts are gonna give it
that extra bite.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.470
Now, if you like
what you're seeing

13:57.570 --> 13:59.439
be sure to smash
that subscribe button.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.876
-And--
-Get your balls off the table!

14:02.976 --> 14:05.812
Oh, oh, great Sharon
you just ruined the shot!

14:06.679 --> 14:09.049
The guys at the deli wanted me
to say hi, Randy.

14:09.149 --> 14:11.251
They all saw you on OnlyFans.

14:11.351 --> 14:13.053
Really?
Are they gonna subscribe?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.787
No, they're not going
to subscribe.

14:14.888 --> 14:16.957
Nobody's going
to subscribe, Randy.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.892
Will you fucking stop?

14:18.992 --> 14:20.560
This stuff takes time!

14:20.660 --> 14:22.729
You don't just put up a page
and immediately get followers.

14:22.829 --> 14:24.998
You have to support it
with other social media,

14:25.098 --> 14:26.433
have a craft to teach...

14:26.533 --> 14:28.735
Being an influencer
takes time, Sharon!

14:28.835 --> 14:30.971
Oh, so now
you're an influencer?

14:31.071 --> 14:32.906
Yes! I'm an influencer.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.742
Maybe you should see
how it feels, Randy.

14:35.842 --> 14:39.479
Maybe I should go
and do my own OnlyFans.

14:39.579 --> 14:41.648
(chuckling):
What? What?

14:41.748 --> 14:44.017
Yeah, like people are gonna pay
to see your OnlyFans.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.086
I'll make more than you do!

14:46.186 --> 14:48.388
Sharon, being
an influencer is work.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.357
You got to pay for the lighting,
for the sound,

14:50.457 --> 14:51.824
you got to be good at editing!

14:51.925 --> 14:53.160
Okay. Cool, Randy.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.794
I'm gonna go start
an OnlyFans channel.

14:54.894 --> 14:58.365
Ok-okay.
Okay, you go do that, Sharon!

14:58.465 --> 15:01.201
I'm gonna fuckin' do it!

15:01.301 --> 15:04.204
Okay, yeah, go supplement
our income, Shar...

15:04.304 --> 15:06.539
(chuckles weakly)

15:06.639 --> 15:07.774
Sharon?

15:12.145 --> 15:14.381
* *

15:32.032 --> 15:33.733
You got this day, bro!

15:33.833 --> 15:37.370
You're strong and I'm gonna
keep on making videos for you.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.080
* I've got Cred, bitches *

15:47.180 --> 15:48.381
* I've got Cred *

15:48.481 --> 15:50.483
* I've got Cred, bitches *

15:50.583 --> 15:52.485
* I've got Cred. *

15:55.555 --> 15:57.390
Hey, guys, we're having
a Cred affinity group meeting

15:57.490 --> 15:58.925
today at 4:00.
Nobody's allowed but us, okay?

15:59.026 --> 16:00.393
Hey, Jordan.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.694
We're having a meeting today.
You can't come.

16:01.794 --> 16:02.962
Affinity group meeting
today, Sally.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.297
You're not invited.

16:04.397 --> 16:05.565
Well, I think that's just
about everyone.

16:05.665 --> 16:06.833
Tweek, did you tell
Spencer Hollis

16:06.933 --> 16:08.368
he's not allowed
in the affinity group?

16:08.468 --> 16:09.902
Yeah. You told me
to call him last night.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.204
He didn't seem to care.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.506
-Yeah, he cares.
-Oh, there's Clyde!

16:13.606 --> 16:17.344
Hey, Clyde. Look at you
with your nice new backpack.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.112
Oh, uh, yeah.
You guys like it?

16:19.212 --> 16:20.280
Yeah, it's really cool.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.714
You can see your Cred now.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.416
Yeah, it's really nice
the way your Cred is--

16:23.516 --> 16:26.586
Oh, my God! Clyde!
You got Moonrise Mellow?

16:26.686 --> 16:28.688
How the hell did you get
a bottle of Moonrise Mellow?

16:28.788 --> 16:31.524
Oh, it was just, uh,
what my parents gave me today.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.026
You guys,
Moonrise Mellow is, like,

16:33.126 --> 16:34.527
the hardest flavor to get ever.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.464
-Whoa, lucky.
-Yeah, hey, I'm not sharing.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.233
-Hey, Stan. Hey, Stan.
-No, no, dude, wait.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.802
Check out what Clyde has.
Moonrise Mellow.

16:42.902 --> 16:43.836
That's impossible.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.572
(laughs)
Look at their faces.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.207
They're so jealous.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.575
No, it's really impossible.

16:48.675 --> 16:50.310
Moonrise Mellow was
discontinued months ago.

16:50.410 --> 16:53.080
Guess you wish now that you were
in the Cred affinity group.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.882
We told you guys we have better
Cred than anyone at school.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.250
It's probably fake.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.152
Oh! Oh, you think
it's fake, huh?

16:59.252 --> 17:01.088
You want to fucking taste it?

17:01.188 --> 17:02.889
(sputters)
What the fuck?

17:02.989 --> 17:04.924
This is fucking apple juice.
Gross!

17:05.024 --> 17:07.927
-Let's see.
-Hey, give it back.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.130
Yeah, it's apple juice.
You guys are posers.

17:10.230 --> 17:11.598
We're not posers!

17:11.698 --> 17:14.401
Hey, guys. Cred affinity group
uses fake Cred.

17:17.437 --> 17:18.638
What the fuck?

17:18.738 --> 17:20.073
What the fuck
have you done, Clyde?

17:20.173 --> 17:21.241
I'm sorry, okay?

17:21.341 --> 17:22.575
Oh, he's sorry.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.277
He faked having Cred,
but he's sorry!

17:24.377 --> 17:27.447
All right, look, my parents
won't let me drink Cred, okay?

17:27.547 --> 17:29.416
They think it's bad for me.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.751
So you never had Cred?

17:31.851 --> 17:32.852
No.

17:32.952 --> 17:34.154
Oh, my God!

17:34.254 --> 17:36.423
We all said you had Cred
in your backpack, Clyde.

17:36.523 --> 17:37.757
We fucking backed you!

17:37.857 --> 17:39.892
What the hell are we gonna do?

17:39.992 --> 17:41.161
Why do you guys care?

17:41.261 --> 17:42.495
I'm the one who doesn't
have any Cred!

17:42.595 --> 17:43.930
That's not how it works, man!

17:44.030 --> 17:45.632
If you don't have Cred,
then everyone around you

17:45.732 --> 17:47.267
loses all their Cred.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.869
We're dead.
We're fuckin' dead.

17:49.969 --> 17:51.471
Word is gonna spread
through the school

17:51.571 --> 17:52.839
that our affinity group
has no Cred

17:52.939 --> 17:54.641
and then we're gonna--
(gags)

17:55.575 --> 17:57.810
(retching)

17:59.446 --> 18:01.381
How could you do this
to us, Clyde?

18:01.481 --> 18:03.350
I'm sorry.
It was all the pressure.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.118
(Cartman retching)

18:05.218 --> 18:07.487
I never even wanted to be
in an affinity group.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.021
Now I'm doomed!

18:09.122 --> 18:11.090
(retching)

18:11.191 --> 18:14.527
SHARON (moaning):
Ooh... oh. Oh, yeah.

18:14.627 --> 18:16.863
-You like that, guys?
-Oh, my God.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.732
-Oh... Oh, God.
-Oh, my God. She did it.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.402
-Mm... Oh, yeah.
-She actually did it.

18:22.502 --> 18:25.071
-She actually got
more subscribers than me.
-Ooh, yeah, guys.

18:25.172 --> 18:26.839
Oh, yeah.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.675
Just let me know
if there's anything special

18:28.775 --> 18:30.343
you'd like to see, guys.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.712
-3,100 subscribers.
-Ooh...

18:32.812 --> 18:34.481
-Oh, oh, yeah...
-How is that possible?

18:34.581 --> 18:36.283
I mean, look at that,
the lighting sucks.

18:36.383 --> 18:37.684
The sound keeps clipping

18:37.784 --> 18:39.786
like she got a microphone
at Walmart or something.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.655
And who's that guy?
He's blocking half the shot.

18:42.755 --> 18:45.258
-Oh, oh, ooh...
-This is total amateur hour!

18:45.358 --> 18:47.527
Thanks for calling
OnlyFans customer support.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.795
How can I help you?

18:48.895 --> 18:50.997
Yeah, I just found out
that my wife has

18:51.097 --> 18:52.365
an OnlyFans page,

18:52.465 --> 18:54.734
and in one day she has
more subscribers than me.

18:54.834 --> 18:57.270
I'm starting to think
this whole thing is rigged.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.838
Well, it is slightly easier

18:58.938 --> 19:01.708
for our female content creators
to find an audience.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.544
Look, my wife can't become
a bigger influencer than me.

19:04.644 --> 19:05.745
I'll never hear the end of it.

19:05.845 --> 19:07.480
Well, sir, have you been trying

19:07.580 --> 19:09.649
the pointers we discussed
to reach a larger audience?

19:09.749 --> 19:11.318
Yes! I added a skill.

19:11.418 --> 19:14.721
I'm advertising my OnlyFans page
with TikTok and Instagram.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.257
What about optimizing
your algorithm?

19:17.357 --> 19:19.592
Oh, um, how do I do that?

19:19.692 --> 19:21.060
No, no, no.
Not with your penis.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.029
See, what a lot
of influencers will do is

19:23.129 --> 19:25.565
they talk about things
and show things in their videos

19:25.665 --> 19:26.733
that are trending.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.435
Then you can hashtag that,

19:28.535 --> 19:30.770
and the search engines will
think your content is trending.

19:30.870 --> 19:34.941
So I... add stuff to my videos
that's popular,

19:35.041 --> 19:37.009
and people will
accidentally go to my page

19:37.109 --> 19:38.845
trying to search
for that popular thing.

19:38.945 --> 19:39.979
Exactly.

19:40.079 --> 19:41.381
That's perfect!

19:41.481 --> 19:45.084
But what's trending most
on the Internet right now?

19:50.290 --> 19:52.759
Oh, hey there, Clyde.
How was school?

19:52.859 --> 19:55.628
You want to know how school was?

19:55.728 --> 19:57.196
It fucking sucked!

19:57.297 --> 19:59.766
All I wanted was to have
a little bit of Cred at school,

19:59.866 --> 20:02.302
but now I've destroyed it
and everyone hates me!

20:02.402 --> 20:05.772
Oh, Clyde, we're always trying
to do what's best for you.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.807
And you shut
the fuck up, Janice!

20:07.907 --> 20:10.810
-You are not my mom.
-Clyde!

20:12.379 --> 20:15.014
INFLUENCER:
I seriously can't stand
how stupid people are sometimes.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.717
That's why I do
all my pranks and stuff.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.753
Sometimes it's impossible
to stay positive

20:20.853 --> 20:22.188
when everyone sucks so hard.

20:22.289 --> 20:23.890
If you like
what I'm saying in this video,

20:23.990 --> 20:26.058
smash that like button
down below.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.395
You know, the thing is,

20:28.495 --> 20:29.929
when you really feel
the most down,

20:30.029 --> 20:32.332
that's when you got to
fight the hardest, you know?

20:33.132 --> 20:35.935
I'm gonna give you 10 tips
to being tougher.

20:36.035 --> 20:38.438
But first I want to give
a shout-out to our sponsor

20:38.538 --> 20:40.172
Cred hydration drinks!

20:40.273 --> 20:41.641
(exasperated sigh)

20:41.741 --> 20:43.242
Cred gives you all
the energy you need!

20:43.343 --> 20:45.978
And now Cred has an all-new
exclusive flavor.

20:46.078 --> 20:48.515
Introducing new Mega Cred.

20:48.615 --> 20:49.882
It's a super limited edition

20:49.982 --> 20:52.251
only available
to a select few.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.454
And Cred's doing a big giveaway

20:54.554 --> 20:57.890
and maybe these super limited
edition bottles can be yours.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.992
* *

21:02.529 --> 21:03.830
So I looked it up,

21:03.930 --> 21:05.231
and there's this drink
called Cred

21:05.332 --> 21:07.600
that's the most searched thing
on the internet.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.101
I figured if I can get my hands

21:09.201 --> 21:10.970
on some of the more
hard to get bottles

21:11.070 --> 21:13.873
and put them in my videos,
maybe I'll get more traffic.

21:13.973 --> 21:16.643
Everyone says maybe
you can help me.

21:18.311 --> 21:21.147
Cred? What's Cred?
Never heard of it.

21:22.181 --> 21:24.050
Okay, look,
I'm not wearing a wire.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.618
You want to see?

21:25.718 --> 21:28.321
No, no, I don't want to see!
What the hell is wrong with you?

21:28.421 --> 21:30.390
I'm looking for a lot of Cred.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.824
Maybe I can even get them

21:31.924 --> 21:33.726
to eventually sponsor
my adult web channel.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.027
Oh, okay. Then you'll want

21:35.127 --> 21:36.696
some of the harder stuff
that's marketed

21:36.796 --> 21:37.997
for adults only.

21:38.097 --> 21:40.266
Like maybe...
Peppa Pig Peppermint.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.535
That doesn't sound like
it's marketed for adults.

21:42.635 --> 21:46.373
Oh, well, maybe you want to try
the I'm a Big Boy Blueberry.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.475
All right, look, just--
How much for the whole bag?

21:48.575 --> 21:50.643
You want my whole bag of Cred?

21:50.743 --> 21:51.944
I want you to supply me

21:52.044 --> 21:54.046
with every bottle of Cred
you can find.

21:54.146 --> 21:57.183
I have to have more subscribers
than my wife.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.363
Eric, sweetie,
are you feeling any better?

22:11.431 --> 22:13.800
No, Mom, I'm dying.

22:13.900 --> 22:16.403
I've been completely
discredited.

22:17.169 --> 22:21.140
Eric, everything is going
to be okay at school tomorrow.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.742
It's too late.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.444
I've already stepped down
as founder and chairman

22:24.544 --> 22:25.978
of my own affinity group.

22:26.078 --> 22:28.715
You'll find my letter of
resignation on the nightstand.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.619
I'm choosing to step down

22:32.719 --> 22:35.722
before all those sick bastards
at school try and force me out.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.924
Well, you need to sit up
for just a minute.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.892
Your little friend Clyde
wants to talk to you.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.629
Clyde? No, no, no, no, no.
Do not let-- Mom!

22:42.729 --> 22:44.731
Do not let Clyde in my--
Aw, goddamn it.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.365
What do you guys want?

22:46.466 --> 22:49.068
Eric, Clyde has an idea
that might save our Cred.

22:49.869 --> 22:52.405
Nothing is going to save
our Cred, you boners.

22:52.505 --> 22:54.040
Will you just listen?

22:54.140 --> 22:56.308
My influencer said there's
gonna be a big Cred promotion

22:56.409 --> 22:57.544
at a CVS in Pueblo.

22:57.644 --> 22:58.945
A promotion, great.

22:59.045 --> 23:00.447
They're gonna sell
a very limited quantity

23:00.547 --> 23:02.849
of an all-new Cred
that nobody's even tried yet.

23:02.949 --> 23:04.851
TWEEK:
So we could ditch school,

23:04.951 --> 23:06.285
find a way to get to Pueblo

23:06.385 --> 23:08.187
and come back with a Cred
nobody else can even get.

23:08.287 --> 23:09.789
We'd have our Cred back.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.659
We followed Clyde before,
you guys,

23:12.759 --> 23:14.461
and it cost us everything.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.028
Look, 50 cases of Cred,

23:16.128 --> 23:17.964
only available tomorrow
200 miles away

23:18.064 --> 23:19.866
and then not available
for another six months.

23:19.966 --> 23:21.367
It's called Mega Cred.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.272
All right, you son of a bitch.

23:26.372 --> 23:29.375
Maybe our affinity group
isn't dead just yet.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.048
Hey, what up, guys?
It's your boy Randy.

23:36.148 --> 23:37.617
In this video,
I'm gonna be trying out

23:37.717 --> 23:40.286
six different flavors
of the newest sports drink.

23:40.386 --> 23:43.155
As you can see, I've got
lots of Cred. Do you like Cred?

23:43.255 --> 23:44.624
If so, leave a comment
down below,

23:44.724 --> 23:46.325
and maybe smash
that like button.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.260
Okay, we're gonna start
with Summer Popsicle.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.996
I guess it's pretty popular.
(sniffs)

23:50.096 --> 23:52.699
Smells okay.
Let's see how good it is.

23:54.701 --> 23:56.335
Ooh. Oh, okay, yeah.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.670
That one's kind of fizzy.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.672
K-Kind of fizzy,
but more on the penis

23:59.772 --> 24:01.040
than it is on them balls.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.542
Yeah, this is really nice.

24:02.642 --> 24:04.310
Oh. Oh, yeah, it looks good.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.278
Yeah, looks delicious.
Oishii.

24:06.378 --> 24:08.815
Hey If you're liking the
content, be sure to subscribe.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.116
Really helps the channel out.

24:10.216 --> 24:11.918
Let's move on
to another flavor now.

24:12.018 --> 24:13.853
This one's called
Purple Snow Globe.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.254
Let's see how it tastes.

24:15.354 --> 24:18.090
Ooh. Oh, yeah.
Yeah, that's a good one.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.726
(chimes)

24:21.528 --> 24:22.929
Oh?

24:23.730 --> 24:24.731
Oh, my God!

24:24.831 --> 24:26.165
Hey, Sharon!

24:26.265 --> 24:28.200
Sharon, you got to see this!

24:31.003 --> 24:32.572
Oh, there you are, Sharon.

24:32.672 --> 24:35.642
Been out shopping with all
the money you made on OnlyFans?

24:35.742 --> 24:37.977
I'm ready to stop
whenever you are.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.146
Oh, ho! Yeah,
I don't think so, Sharon.

24:40.246 --> 24:43.215
I just had a video on TikTok
with 1,000 views

24:43.315 --> 24:45.752
and a video on Meta with 2,000!

24:45.852 --> 24:49.088
That's gonna drive all the
subscribers to my OnlyFans page.

24:49.188 --> 24:52.224
You said my penis wasn't
a big deal, and now look!

24:52.992 --> 24:55.094
What are you doing
to that Cred bottle?

24:55.194 --> 24:57.029
Oh, that's just
a little trend jumping.

24:57.129 --> 25:00.199
Randy, you know who
drinks Cred, right? Children!

25:00.299 --> 25:02.201
No, it's not even
suitable for children.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.170
Okay, this has to stop, Randy.

25:04.270 --> 25:07.439
The only views you're getting on
TikTok and Meta are from kids!

25:07.540 --> 25:09.909
That's not what
the data shows, Sharon.

25:10.009 --> 25:11.277
According to Meta and TikTok,

25:11.377 --> 25:12.912
their audience
is predominately people

25:13.012 --> 25:14.280
over the age of 22.

25:14.380 --> 25:16.382
That means it's not kids
who care about Cred,

25:16.482 --> 25:19.418
it's adults
who want to see my dick.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.989
Randy, please.
Let's just call it a tie, okay?

25:23.089 --> 25:25.191
Oh, I bet you'd love that now.

25:25.291 --> 25:29.028
Now that my OnlyFans is
about to be bigger than yours.

25:29.128 --> 25:31.898
I'm gonna beat your ass, honey!

25:35.902 --> 25:38.170
(brakes hiss)

25:39.505 --> 25:40.907
Oh, Jesus, now it looks
like they're doing

25:41.007 --> 25:42.842
a two-bottle max per person.

25:42.942 --> 25:45.712
O-Okay, so two bottles each.
That means we'll have eight.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.747
-Is that enough Cred?
-Oh, my God.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.048
No!

25:49.148 --> 25:51.117
(chanting): We want Cred!
We want Cred!

25:51.217 --> 25:54.687
We want Cred! We want Cred!

25:54.787 --> 25:56.455
Dude, there's like
2,000 kids here.

25:56.555 --> 25:58.057
Don't these losers have
anything better to do

25:58.157 --> 25:59.558
than fight over a shitty drink?

25:59.659 --> 26:01.360
Come on, we gotta make our way
to the front.

26:01.460 --> 26:04.764
Tom, I'm standing
outside the CVS in Pueblo

26:04.864 --> 26:08.167
where thousands of children
have shown up to get some Cred.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.002
The fake sugar hydration drink

26:10.102 --> 26:12.271
is considered
not suitable for children

26:12.371 --> 26:14.173
and yet kids
are literally fighting

26:14.273 --> 26:16.776
to get their hands
on this limited edition.

26:16.876 --> 26:20.579
I'll be covering the whole thing
live here on my OnlyFans page.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.916
Just DM me if there's anything
custom you'd like to see.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.551
Dude, this is fucking crazy!

26:25.652 --> 26:27.854
There's never gonna be
enough Cred for everybody!

26:27.954 --> 26:30.757
Oh, my God. No. No!

26:30.857 --> 26:32.558
It's fucking Spencer Hollis.

26:32.659 --> 26:34.627
Hey, stop pushing, kid.

26:34.727 --> 26:36.863
What's he doing here,
that dirty son a bitch?

26:36.963 --> 26:38.397
He fucking ditched school
to come get Cred

26:38.497 --> 26:40.900
and he doesn't even like it!
He's a fucking poser!

26:41.000 --> 26:45.638
We want Cred! We want Cred!
We want Cred!

26:45.738 --> 26:48.040
The delivery truck!

26:48.140 --> 26:51.177
(screaming)

26:52.344 --> 26:53.345
Ah!

26:53.445 --> 26:55.047
-Ah! Get away!
-Give me Cred!

26:55.147 --> 26:57.850
You're all a bunch
of animals! Ah!

26:57.950 --> 26:59.652
Cred! Give me the Cred!

26:59.752 --> 27:01.053
I got to have Cred!

27:01.153 --> 27:04.657
We want Cred! We want Cred!

27:04.757 --> 27:07.159
Okay, go, go, go!

27:08.060 --> 27:09.295
Okay, okay, it's here,
you bastards.

27:09.395 --> 27:10.830
-Come in and-- Ah!
-I was here--

27:10.930 --> 27:13.332
Tweek's not gonna make it,
you guys.

27:13.432 --> 27:14.867
(screaming)

27:14.967 --> 27:18.004
-Where is it?
-Where's the Cred?

27:18.104 --> 27:19.972
(screaming)

27:20.072 --> 27:21.540
It's over there!

27:21.640 --> 27:22.909
Give me Cred!

27:23.009 --> 27:25.577
Me first! Me first!

27:27.613 --> 27:29.215
Give me the Cred!

27:31.650 --> 27:33.085
Ah! Ah!

27:33.185 --> 27:35.855
There's some, right there! Ah!

27:35.955 --> 27:38.124
It's gone! It's all gone!

27:38.224 --> 27:41.027
(easy listening music playing)

27:43.029 --> 27:44.697
Mom!

27:45.732 --> 27:46.799
Spencer?

27:46.899 --> 27:49.368
Start the car! Start the car!

27:49.468 --> 27:51.170
Jesus Christ!

27:51.270 --> 27:53.305
Start the fucking car, Mom!

27:53.405 --> 27:55.541
Spencer's getting away
with the Cred!

27:55.641 --> 27:57.043
(engine revving)

27:57.143 --> 27:58.610
(tires squeal)

27:59.578 --> 28:01.613
No!

28:02.414 --> 28:05.451
Well, these are extremely
impressive numbers.

28:05.551 --> 28:08.454
It looks like your content's
getting a lot of views online.

28:08.554 --> 28:09.756
Yeah, thanks.

28:09.856 --> 28:11.357
But you see,
what I'm trying to learn now

28:11.457 --> 28:13.292
is how to take
all the views I'm getting

28:13.392 --> 28:15.661
on like Instagram and stuff
and use them

28:15.762 --> 28:17.196
to make myself bigger.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.031
Well, we can help you with that.

28:19.131 --> 28:20.132
You know, to really succeed,

28:20.232 --> 28:21.633
you gotta ask yourself:

28:21.734 --> 28:24.771
What is it that you want
to achieve as an influencer?

28:24.871 --> 28:27.606
Well, what I really want to do

28:27.706 --> 28:29.441
is beat my wife.

28:32.411 --> 28:33.946
You want to beat your wife?

28:34.046 --> 28:35.815
I mean, don't we all?

28:35.915 --> 28:37.216
I-I don't understand,

28:37.316 --> 28:39.752
you want to beat your wife
on Instagram?

28:39.852 --> 28:41.153
I want to beat her on Instagram,

28:41.253 --> 28:42.755
I want to beat her on TikTok,

28:42.855 --> 28:45.624
but mostly I want to beat
the shit out of her on OnlyFans

28:45.724 --> 28:47.359
and make a lot
of money doing it.

28:47.459 --> 28:50.429
Hmm. Okay, well, if you can
get the kids to watch

28:50.529 --> 28:52.198
then we can find you a sponsor.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.633
Organizations will do anything
to reach kids these days.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.568
Oh, yeah, yeah,
but, see, my content

28:56.668 --> 28:58.838
actually isn't suitable
for children.

28:58.938 --> 29:00.840
Right. I mean, the data shows

29:00.940 --> 29:03.609
kids aren't the main audience
for any of this stuff, right?

29:03.709 --> 29:06.478
-Right.
-Right.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.648
Mr. Marsh, the thing is,
a sponsor not only gets you cash

29:09.748 --> 29:12.284
but they also help
you push that algorithm

29:12.384 --> 29:14.620
so that their message
is heard through you.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.088
Oh, really?

29:16.188 --> 29:17.689
Yeah, there's gonna be
a lot of companies

29:17.790 --> 29:20.526
that want to pay you to show
your videos to "not kids."

29:20.626 --> 29:22.528
But what we want to do
is get these sponsors

29:22.628 --> 29:24.663
to bid against each other
for your audience.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.966
That's when you become
a big influencer.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.969
And then you can beat
your wife as much as you want.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.404
Wow.

30:00.766 --> 30:02.701
(fire crackling)

30:21.687 --> 30:22.788
There's nothing.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.423
Just two more
broken Cred bottles.

30:24.523 --> 30:27.093
And a couple of cans
of SpaghettiOs.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.799
I don't think I can go back.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.667
Go back to what?

30:35.767 --> 30:37.836
Spencer Hollis
has all the Cred now.

30:37.937 --> 30:40.272
Tomorrow, he'll start
his own affinity group

30:40.372 --> 30:42.274
and not let any of us in.

30:42.374 --> 30:45.244
Don't you guys think
this is all fucked up?

30:45.344 --> 30:47.646
Yeah, fucked up 'cause of you.

30:47.746 --> 30:49.781
No, I mean what
they're doing to us.

30:49.882 --> 30:52.784
Look at this. My influencer
told me to come down here.

30:52.885 --> 30:54.520
He knew there wasn't gonna
be enough Cred for everyone.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.188
It's like--
It's like they wanted to create

30:56.288 --> 30:59.325
this false scarcity.
Give all us kids FOMO.

30:59.425 --> 31:02.061
If anyone's a FOMO,
Clyde, it's you.

31:02.161 --> 31:05.264
You guys aren't listening.
We've been manipulated.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.166
If kids are willing to fight
and die over this,

31:07.266 --> 31:09.468
then what else would they be
willing to fight and die over?

31:09.568 --> 31:11.670
Nobody in school cared
about hydration drinks

31:11.770 --> 31:13.039
three weeks ago.

31:13.139 --> 31:15.541
My influencer convinced me
to come down here.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.077
What else is
he convincing me to do?

31:18.177 --> 31:20.779
So, maybe if we find
your influencer,

31:20.879 --> 31:22.014
then he can give us Cred?

31:22.114 --> 31:23.282
No!

31:23.382 --> 31:25.251
No, no, no.
I like your angle, Clyde.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.919
Maybe this whole thing
is a sham.

31:27.019 --> 31:28.854
If we can make
the whole thing look stupid,

31:28.955 --> 31:30.656
then we make a Cred
affinity group look stupid.

31:30.756 --> 31:32.824
Then Spencer Hollis will
have nothing to keep us out of.

31:32.925 --> 31:35.494
I just know there's more
to all this than we think.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.596
I know what town
my influencer lives in.

31:37.696 --> 31:39.698
I want some goddamn answers.

31:39.798 --> 31:41.133
Tweek, Butters,

31:41.233 --> 31:42.734
gather up all the Pop-Tarts
and SpaghettiOs you can.

31:42.834 --> 31:45.904
We move out at
oh-ninety-two-hundred.

31:54.046 --> 31:55.481
Can I help you?

31:55.581 --> 31:57.383
Yeah, hi, I'm a big influencer?

31:57.483 --> 32:00.386
My agent sent me here
to find a sponsor?

32:00.486 --> 32:03.289
-Name.
-Uh, Randy Marsh?

32:03.389 --> 32:05.024
It's with five Rs
because there was already

32:05.124 --> 32:07.293
a Randy Marsh on TikTok.

32:07.393 --> 32:08.894
Put this around your neck.
Through that door

32:08.995 --> 32:10.796
and wait with
the other influencers.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.364
Oh, okay, thanks.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.669
Okay, influencers, follow me,

32:17.769 --> 32:19.538
stand in a straight line
and step forward

32:19.638 --> 32:21.640
when your number is called.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.180
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.282
We have some incredible
influencers available today.

32:30.382 --> 32:32.351
They are all
complete freelancers

32:32.451 --> 32:34.353
and looking for sponsors.

32:34.453 --> 32:37.856
First off, we have

32:43.329 --> 32:45.164
and is up-and-coming
on Meta and X.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.665
Who would like to own
this influencer?

32:46.765 --> 32:48.934
We'll start the bidding at 20.
20, do I hear 20?

32:49.035 --> 32:50.536
There's 20. Do I hear 25, 25?

32:50.636 --> 32:54.006
Let's hear 25, 25, 30.
(gibberish)

32:54.106 --> 32:55.474

32:55.574 --> 32:57.443
Mattel Toys now

32:57.543 --> 33:01.713

30! 30 from Lunchables!
Let's go 50.

33:03.915 --> 33:05.317

the influencer?

33:05.417 --> 33:07.819

33:07.919 --> 33:11.323
100! 100 from the Chinese
government! Can we go 150?

33:11.423 --> 33:13.692

150, 150, yes!

33:15.661 --> 33:17.329
Stoli Vodka at 150.

33:17.429 --> 33:18.997
150, the current bid
from Stoli Vodka.

33:19.098 --> 33:20.399
What about you, Build-A-Bear?

33:20.499 --> 33:23.902
Do we hear from Build-A-Bear?
(gibberish)

33:24.002 --> 33:27.373
160! 160 from the NRA,
outbidding Stoli Vodka.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.247
Don't let them
outbid you, Russia.

33:35.347 --> 33:37.416
No? Chinese government? No?

33:37.516 --> 33:40.619
Sold to Voices for Ukraine.
Thank you.

33:40.719 --> 33:43.389
I don't understand
what happened.

33:43.489 --> 33:44.690
Just keep making
your stupid videos,

33:44.790 --> 33:46.125
they'll tell you what to say.

33:46.225 --> 33:49.061
Okay, next up we have

33:55.434 --> 33:57.203
and a small following

33:57.303 --> 34:00.005
Who wants Kevinlovesoranges
to push their agenda?

34:00.106 --> 34:02.908
We'll start at 40, 40.
China in at 40, China at 40.

34:03.008 --> 34:06.278
Who's gonna go 50?

Can I hear 70? Last call for 70.

34:15.821 --> 34:17.022
(gibberish)

34:17.123 --> 34:20.025
Sold to the Canadian government,
congratulations.

34:20.126 --> 34:22.861
Our next influencer, number 427.

34:22.961 --> 34:25.231
This is Randy Marrrrrsh.

34:25.331 --> 34:28.200
We'll start the bidding at 50.
50, do I hear 50? 50?

34:28.300 --> 34:30.802
(gibberish)

34:30.902 --> 34:33.605
(gibberish slows)

34:33.705 --> 34:35.907
50? No? Come on, Mattel Toys.
Let's hear from you.

34:36.007 --> 34:37.709
How about 40? 40?

34:37.809 --> 34:39.044
How about 40, let's do 40?

34:39.145 --> 34:41.280
(gibberish)

34:41.380 --> 34:43.582
(gibberish slows)

34:44.516 --> 34:46.618
FBI AGENT:
Freeze! Nobody move!

34:48.254 --> 34:50.389
(people screaming)

34:53.392 --> 34:54.293
Up here! He's up here!

34:54.393 --> 34:56.462
Are you Randy Marrrrrsh?

34:56.562 --> 34:58.464
-Yeah?
-All right, we got him.

34:58.564 --> 34:59.665
Hands behind your back.

34:59.765 --> 35:01.333
Me? I didn't do anything.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.669
I'm just trying
to beat my wife. (chokes)

35:03.769 --> 35:06.938
On your knees!
Hands behind your back now!

35:07.739 --> 35:09.708
(knocking on door)

35:10.576 --> 35:12.878
Hello? Logan LaDouche?

35:12.978 --> 35:16.148
-Hello? We know you're in there.
-(lock clicks)

35:18.817 --> 35:21.420
Go away.
I'm in enough trouble as it is.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.355
Look, dude, we just want
to talk to you, okay?

35:23.455 --> 35:25.324
No, not okay. I'm in hiding.

35:25.424 --> 35:26.925
How did you guys find me?

35:27.025 --> 35:28.727
Dude, if you're in hiding,
you shouldn't probably post

35:28.827 --> 35:30.929
videos of yourself
at the motel you're hiding in.

35:31.029 --> 35:34.700
Shit. Shit,
I just can't help myself.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.606
Brah, we need to know
the truth about Cred.

35:40.706 --> 35:44.042
I'm sorry, okay?
I didn't mean to cause a riot.

35:44.142 --> 35:46.278
Did Cred want us all
to kill each other?

35:47.179 --> 35:50.449
If you found me,
then so can they. Just go.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.484
Okay, okay, fine,
Mr. Influencer,

35:52.584 --> 35:54.720
we'll leave.
(shouts)

35:54.820 --> 35:57.356
-Yeah.
-(shouts) What the fuck
are you doing?

35:57.456 --> 35:59.157
Where's the Cred?
You got some Cred?

35:59.258 --> 36:00.592
Butters, Butters, calm down.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.228
They're gonna take me out, man.

36:02.328 --> 36:05.063
I should just turn myself in.
I'll be safer in jail.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.233
Listen, dude, I went to Pueblo
'cause of you.

36:07.333 --> 36:08.934
Why did you tell us
we could get Mega Cred

36:09.034 --> 36:10.502
when you knew
there wasn't enough?

36:10.602 --> 36:12.638
Brah, I don't even
drink that crap.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.172
Don't you get it, man?

36:14.273 --> 36:16.908
I'm just this tiny little piece
of a very big lie.

36:17.008 --> 36:19.010
You guys are all
being manipulated.

36:19.110 --> 36:21.213
I trusted you.
I've watched all your videos,

36:21.313 --> 36:23.482
and you told me to be strong
and never give up.

36:23.582 --> 36:25.451
That's all just Cred
messing with me?

36:25.551 --> 36:27.953
Don't you get it?
I don't work for Cred.

36:28.053 --> 36:30.556
The Cred is just there
to get views, man.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.224
'Cause kids love it so much.

36:32.324 --> 36:35.160
But if Cred isn't your sponsor,
then-then who is?

36:35.261 --> 36:38.797
If you knew,
it would make you sick.

36:39.765 --> 36:42.368
They just use you and Cred
to get to us,

36:42.468 --> 36:44.035
and those higher-up people

36:44.135 --> 36:45.904
can get us
some limited-edition Cred?

36:46.004 --> 36:48.940
-Who has the Cred?
-Butters, Jesus.

36:53.579 --> 36:55.347
RANDY:
Oh, there-there she is.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.082
Hey, Sharon.

36:57.182 --> 36:58.650
This is my wife, Sharon.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.886
She's an OnlyFans model
just like me.

37:00.986 --> 37:03.822
We are both legally
supplementing our income.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.191
So you work
with your husband, ma'am?

37:06.292 --> 37:08.860
No, we have very different
OnlyFans accounts.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.862
I could never do what he does.

37:10.962 --> 37:12.964
Thanks, honey, it's nice for you
to finally admit it.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.634
Now I'd like to know
what I'm being detained for.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.503
Exposing children
to pornography,

37:17.603 --> 37:19.204
soliciting nude images
to a minor,

37:19.305 --> 37:20.539
child endangerment...

37:20.639 --> 37:22.308
Oh, come on, like it's just me?

37:22.408 --> 37:23.875
Everybody's doing it.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.144
There's an entire network
where everyone just pretends

37:26.244 --> 37:28.013
Internet platforms
aren't made for children

37:28.113 --> 37:31.182
but they all auction our kids
to the highest bidder.

37:32.217 --> 37:35.787
You seem like some kind of
influencer expert.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.956
Would you say these things
on record?

37:38.056 --> 37:39.858
No, 'cause
I'm a sovereign citizen,

37:39.958 --> 37:42.494
and I don't need to tell you
anything. (blows raspberry)

37:42.594 --> 37:45.631
-Randy, you need to cooperate.
-Why?

37:45.731 --> 37:47.999
I'll tell you why, scumbag.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.469
Your posts drew in
a lot of children,

37:50.569 --> 37:52.438
and they like to copy
what they see.

37:52.538 --> 37:56.308
So then kids started creating
their own erotic content

37:56.408 --> 37:58.243
based on yours.

37:58.344 --> 38:00.312
* *

38:00.412 --> 38:02.113
-What?
-That's right.

38:02.213 --> 38:04.983
We've just found
sexuality explicit,

38:05.083 --> 38:08.219
pornographic images of minors.

38:08.320 --> 38:10.922
I warn you,
what you are about to see

38:11.022 --> 38:14.393
is extremely disturbing
and graphic.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.728
* *

38:26.338 --> 38:29.475
Oh, God. Ugh.

38:29.575 --> 38:31.042
Oh, don't close your eyes now.

38:31.142 --> 38:34.212
You think these miners deserved
to be treated like this?

38:44.790 --> 38:47.893
What have I done? I had no idea.

38:47.993 --> 38:51.062
Randy, you knew kids were
watching your content.

38:51.162 --> 38:53.699
Yeah, but I never knew
it would lead to...

38:53.799 --> 38:55.901
pornographic images of miners.

38:56.001 --> 38:57.903
God, it's disgusting.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.939
Being an influencer
is disgusting.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.475
All right, I'm gonna tell you
everything I know

39:03.575 --> 39:05.511
about how the system works.

39:05.611 --> 39:07.212
This has to stop.

39:08.146 --> 39:09.415
Hey, what's up, guys?

39:09.515 --> 39:11.016
Just wanted to let you all know
that I think

39:11.116 --> 39:12.484
maybe I'm gonna get killed
or arrested,

39:12.584 --> 39:14.420
so I'm hiding out
in this motel room.

39:14.520 --> 39:17.055
Be sure to like and subscribe.
It really helps the channel out.

39:17.155 --> 39:18.924
Dude, will you stop
making videos?

39:19.024 --> 39:20.959
I don't know what else
to do, okay?

39:21.059 --> 39:23.695
All I've ever done
is make fucking videos.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.564
But for who?
You said it wasn't for Cred,

39:25.664 --> 39:27.098
so then who sponsors you?

39:27.198 --> 39:29.200
LOGAN:
I just wanted to be
a big influencer.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.537
So I got put on this stage
and I was auctioned off

39:31.637 --> 39:33.138
to the highest bidder.

39:33.238 --> 39:36.107
People will pay anything to push
their agenda on you guys.

39:36.207 --> 39:38.376
What, you mean, like, the
Chinese government or something?

39:38.477 --> 39:41.279
I'm sponsored by people worse
than the Chinese government.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.882
I can't tell you who they are,
because then the companies

39:43.982 --> 39:46.284
that run the whole system
will have me killed.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.319
We deserve to know
who's been manipulating us.

39:48.420 --> 39:51.757
Tell us the truth and we'll
make sure you're safe, okay?

39:52.558 --> 39:54.059
You promise?

39:54.159 --> 39:56.462
Yes, we promise.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.163
Fine.

39:58.263 --> 40:00.932
The truth is,
I'm being paid by...

40:01.032 --> 40:03.268
-(gunshot)
-(grunts)

40:03.368 --> 40:05.103
Whoops!

40:07.806 --> 40:09.374
-(screams)
-Okay, okay.

40:09.475 --> 40:12.077
We don't care who's trying
to influence us!

40:12.878 --> 40:15.681
(sirens wailing)

40:15.781 --> 40:17.983
(tires screeching)

40:18.083 --> 40:19.350
The game is up, scumbag.

40:19.451 --> 40:21.987
We know about
the whole operation.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.124
-(megaphone static)
-We know everything.

40:26.224 --> 40:28.827
The influencers are being paid
by organizations

40:28.927 --> 40:32.030
to knowingly influence children.

40:33.732 --> 40:35.467
-(megaphone static)
-ASSASSIN: The data shows
that consumers

40:35.567 --> 40:39.805
of social media platforms are
predominately adults over 21.

40:39.905 --> 40:41.272
Oh, come on.

40:41.372 --> 40:43.374
Within tech companies,
it's an open secret

40:43.475 --> 40:47.613
that millions of users are
actually under the age of 13.

40:47.713 --> 40:49.915
ASSASSIN:
Tech companies
are working diligently

40:50.015 --> 40:52.217
to find ways to make
the Internet safer for children,

40:52.317 --> 40:53.852
but these methods
are often criticized

40:53.952 --> 40:56.054
for violating free speech.

40:56.154 --> 40:59.725
Okay, and tech companies
use those assertions

40:59.825 --> 41:03.895
and their endless cash to keep
regulations tied up in court

41:03.995 --> 41:07.899
so they can continue
to profit off of our kids.

41:07.999 --> 41:09.901
(megaphone static)

41:10.001 --> 41:13.905
Okay, well, you'll never
take me alive, copper.

41:15.807 --> 41:17.375
(shouts)

41:20.579 --> 41:24.182
He's still alive.
Let's get City General out here.

41:27.418 --> 41:31.056
Who do you work for?
Who's trying to influence me?

41:33.659 --> 41:34.726
(grunts)

41:34.826 --> 41:37.062
(babbles)

41:38.797 --> 41:40.331
He's just the middleman, kids.

41:40.431 --> 41:44.269
Whoever was trying to influence
you is still a mystery.

41:49.575 --> 41:51.242
(brakes hiss)

41:58.249 --> 42:00.518
Hey, fellas, I got an idea.

42:00.619 --> 42:02.988
How about we just keep
our affinity group,

42:03.088 --> 42:04.556
but instead of it being
about Cred,

42:04.656 --> 42:07.659
it's just about how proud we are
of who we are.

42:07.759 --> 42:09.995
No, they won't let us do that,
Butters, 'cause we're white.

42:10.095 --> 42:11.362
White people can't be in groups
talking about

42:11.462 --> 42:13.431
how proud they are,
it doesn't fly.

42:13.531 --> 42:14.833
Dang it.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.702
Well, then, I guess
we just got to accept

42:16.802 --> 42:18.436
that we're gonna
go to school tomorrow

42:18.536 --> 42:20.305
and get totally boned.

42:20.405 --> 42:21.640
Yep.

42:21.740 --> 42:23.074
(thudding)

42:23.174 --> 42:26.344
Hey, look, you guys. It's Cred.

42:27.312 --> 42:29.347
(engine running)

42:32.217 --> 42:35.453
Mr. Marsh? What are you doing
with all that Cred?

42:35.553 --> 42:39.257
I'm putting it where it belongs,
in the garbage.

42:41.159 --> 42:43.094
But that's, like, Jelly Roll
Midnight Waffle House.

42:43.194 --> 42:44.963
Do you know what that's worth?

42:45.063 --> 42:46.431
Yeah, I know what it's worth.

42:46.531 --> 42:48.533
It's worth gold
to all the people in the world

42:48.634 --> 42:51.469
who want to use social media
to influence children.

42:51.569 --> 42:54.139
But there's more to life
than making money.

42:54.239 --> 42:57.676
And there's more to marriage
than just beating your wife.

42:57.776 --> 42:59.410
The bottom line is that

42:59.510 --> 43:02.113
all this social media
influencer garbage

43:02.213 --> 43:04.783
is not suitable for children.

43:04.883 --> 43:06.885
And if you're a kid
on social media,

43:06.985 --> 43:10.789
you have to know that someone
is always trying to get to you.

43:10.889 --> 43:13.224
All you have to do
is ask yourself,

43:13.324 --> 43:17.262
"Who is it that wants
to influence me the most?"

43:20.799 --> 43:23.268
Holy shit.

43:26.471 --> 43:28.907
Janice!

43:30.475 --> 43:33.578
Oh, Clyde, where have you been?
We've been worried sick.

43:33.679 --> 43:35.714
It was you, this whole time.

43:35.814 --> 43:38.216
You've been trying
to influence me for months.

43:38.316 --> 43:39.785
Clyde, you really should have

43:39.885 --> 43:41.286
let your father know
where you were...

43:41.386 --> 43:43.521
You've been paying an influencer
to try and reach me,

43:43.621 --> 43:45.590
and you caused this whole
fucking mess!

43:45.691 --> 43:48.059
What is this about, Janice?

43:48.159 --> 43:52.463
I don't think people understand
how hard it is to be a stepmom.

43:53.699 --> 43:55.500
You want to try
and teach your kids,

43:55.600 --> 43:59.070
but they don't listen because
you're not their "real parent."

44:00.238 --> 44:03.308
I just wanted to be
a good influence on you, Clyde.

44:03.408 --> 44:05.143
But influencing kids these days

44:05.243 --> 44:09.047
requires good lighting
and a quality microphone.

44:09.915 --> 44:11.950
But why Cred?
If you're so against it,

44:12.050 --> 44:13.584
then why have it
in all those videos?

44:13.685 --> 44:16.187
That was just to get
your views, Clyde.

44:16.287 --> 44:19.657
Your views
are so important to me,

44:19.758 --> 44:21.492
because we never talk.

44:21.592 --> 44:24.095
Maybe what I did
was all a bit much,

44:24.195 --> 44:25.964
but look at us.

44:26.064 --> 44:28.700
Here we are, talking.

44:31.469 --> 44:33.972
Janice, can I call you "Mom"?

44:34.072 --> 44:36.141
Yes, of course.

44:36.241 --> 44:38.343
Fuck you, Mom!

44:41.212 --> 44:43.414
(exhales):
Oh...

44:44.249 --> 44:46.117
(indistinct chatter)

44:47.285 --> 44:49.721
Whoa, Spencer,
is that Mega Cred?

44:49.821 --> 44:51.222
Yeah, pretty cool, right?

44:51.322 --> 44:53.258
"Pretty cool"?
How'd you get that?

44:53.358 --> 44:55.761
Oh, I just went to this thing
in Pueblo. No big deal.

44:55.861 --> 44:59.097
Everyone! Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

44:59.197 --> 45:01.332
We have something really
important to tell you guys.

45:01.432 --> 45:02.868
Tweek and Butters and I
have learned

45:02.968 --> 45:04.435
a lot of things recently.

45:04.535 --> 45:07.038
We have news
that you will all find shocking.

45:07.138 --> 45:09.040
You see, we talked to Mr. Marsh,

45:09.140 --> 45:11.276
and he gave us four bottles

45:11.376 --> 45:13.845
of Jelly Roll
Midnight Waffle House.

45:13.945 --> 45:15.280
(all gasping)

45:15.380 --> 45:17.082
-(cheering, screaming)
-No, no, no. Back up.

45:17.182 --> 45:19.517
This is for the Cred
affinity group only.

45:19.617 --> 45:22.187
-You can look at our Cred,
but don't touch.
-All right!

45:22.287 --> 45:24.722
Oh, oh, hey, Clyde.

45:24.823 --> 45:26.457
Say, Clyde, you, uh,

45:26.557 --> 45:28.459
forgot your super special
Jelly Roll Cred

45:28.559 --> 45:30.495
at the group meeting, remember?

45:38.169 --> 45:40.005
It tastes amazing.

45:40.105 --> 45:41.239
-(cheering)
-All right!

45:41.339 --> 45:43.641
Yeah! Clyde's got Cred again!

45:43.741 --> 45:45.777
(cheering)

45:50.715 --> 45:52.750
* *

46:22.280 --> 46:24.749
* *
