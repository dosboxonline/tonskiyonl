00:50.969 --> 00:52.887
<i>I'm not ashamed.</i>

00:52.971 --> 00:54.806
<i>I've known love.</i>

00:54.889 --> 00:56.599
<i>I've known rejection.</i>

00:57.475 --> 01:00.270
<i>I'm not afraid to declare my feelings.</i>

01:00.353 --> 01:03.273
<i>Take trust, for instance. Or friendship.</i>

01:04.274 --> 01:06.234
<i>These are the important things in life.</i>

01:06.317 --> 01:09.821
<i>These are the things that matter,
that help you on your way.</i>

01:10.989 --> 01:13.658
<i>If you can't trust your friends,
well, what then?</i>

01:14.576 --> 01:15.910
<i>What then?</i>

01:19.205 --> 01:22.751
<i>This could have been any city.
They're all the same.</i>

02:49.963 --> 02:52.298
Hello. I've come about the room.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.059
So, what's his name?

03:03.142 --> 03:04.269
I don't know.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.395
Campbell or something.

03:05.478 --> 03:06.521
Cameron.

03:06.604 --> 03:07.564
- Cameron?
- Mm-hmm.

03:07.647 --> 03:09.482
- Really?
- That's right.

03:10.525 --> 03:12.068
What?

03:12.151 --> 03:13.027
Uh ‒

03:13.111 --> 03:15.029
Well, are you comfortable, Cameron?

03:15.113 --> 03:16.155
Yes, thanks.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.408
- You've seen the flat?
- Yes.

03:18.491 --> 03:19.784
And you like it?

03:19.868 --> 03:21.369
- Yes. It's great.
- Yes, it is, isn't it?

03:21.452 --> 03:23.746
And we all like it.
The room's nice, too, don't you think?

03:23.830 --> 03:24.497
Yes.

03:24.581 --> 03:26.916
Spacious, bright, well-appointed ‒
all that sort of stuff.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.209
All that sort of crap.

03:28.293 --> 03:29.711
Well, yes.

03:29.794 --> 03:32.755
Yes. So tell me, Cameron.
Just tell me, 'cause I'd like to know.

03:32.881 --> 03:36.426
What on earth could make you think
we'd want to share a flat like this
with someone like you?

03:36.509 --> 03:38.553
I mean, my first impressions ‒
and they're rarely wrong ‒

03:38.636 --> 03:41.973
is that you have none of the qualities
we normally seek from a prospective flatmate.

03:42.056 --> 03:45.727
Talking here about things like presence,
charisma, style and charm.

03:45.810 --> 03:48.563
And I don't think we're asking too much.
I don't think we're being unreasonable.

03:48.646 --> 03:50.398
Take David here, for instance ‒

03:50.481 --> 03:53.234
a chartered accountant he may be,
but at least he tries hard.

03:53.318 --> 03:55.570
Trouble is, I just don't think you're trying.

03:56.779 --> 04:00.283
And, Cameron, I mean this ‒ good luck!

04:11.336 --> 04:14.088
- Just a few questions.
- I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.

04:14.172 --> 04:16.298
- Why do you want a room here?
- Do you smoke?

04:16.382 --> 04:19.177
Now when you sacrifice a goat and you
rip its heart out with your bare hands...

04:19.260 --> 04:20.303
do you then summon hellfire?

04:20.386 --> 04:22.305
It's a fairly straightforward question.

04:22.388 --> 04:24.515
Either you're divorced or you're not.

04:24.599 --> 04:26.100
Or do you just send out for a pizza?

04:26.184 --> 04:28.436
Do a little freebase maybe,
from time to time?

04:28.519 --> 04:31.189
When you get up in the morning, how do you
decide which shade of black to wear?

04:31.272 --> 04:34.692
Okay, I'm going to play
just a few seconds of this tape.

04:34.776 --> 04:37.320
I'd like you to name the song,
the lead singer...

04:37.403 --> 04:41.491
and three hit singles subsequently
recorded by him with another band.

04:47.205 --> 04:49.040
<i>Flip side.</i>

04:50.959 --> 04:53.336
Now let me get this straight.

04:53.419 --> 04:56.005
This affair that you're not having ‒

04:56.089 --> 04:58.508
is it not with a man
or not with a woman?

04:58.591 --> 05:00.802
Turning very briefly to corporate finance ‒

05:00.885 --> 05:03.304
- David.
- No, this is important.

05:03.429 --> 05:05.723
Leveraged buyouts ‒ a good thing or a bad thing?

05:05.807 --> 05:08.309
When did anyone last say to you
these exact words ‒

05:08.393 --> 05:10.979
"You are the sunshine of my life"?

05:13.731 --> 05:16.985
And how would you react, then,
if I told you I was the Antichrist?

05:21.489 --> 05:23.574
Do you like my picture?

05:35.712 --> 05:36.838
Defeat!

05:36.921 --> 05:38.297
Defeat, defeat!

05:38.381 --> 05:40.800
Sporting, personal, financial...

05:40.883 --> 05:43.428
professional sexual ‒ and everything.

05:45.263 --> 05:46.097
Next.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.856
- Did you know that ‒
- Alex.

05:54.939 --> 05:56.274
Just serve.

05:59.152 --> 06:02.238
Anyway, I wasn't trying to win.

06:02.321 --> 06:06.075
No, I don't wish to devalue your victory, Juliet.
All I'm saying is I wasn't trying to win.

06:06.159 --> 06:09.704
Victory is the same as defeat.
It's giving in to destructive competitive urges.

06:09.787 --> 06:12.707
Oh, did you learn that
in your psychotherapy group, David?

06:12.790 --> 06:14.876
Discussion group, Alex <i>. Discussion.</i>

06:14.959 --> 06:17.920
- I thought you'd stopped going.
- Yeah, well, he had too many of those urges.

06:18.004 --> 06:19.714
You of all people should know about that.

06:20.965 --> 06:23.217
God, you two are sensitive.

06:23.301 --> 06:27.388
All I'm doing is implying some kind
of ugly, sordid sexual liaison.

06:27.472 --> 06:29.140
Why, I'd be proud of that sort of thing.

06:29.223 --> 06:32.101
Maybe you should go, Alex.
You'll meet someone wonderful.

06:32.185 --> 06:34.896
For my life? At a discussion group?

06:34.979 --> 06:36.647
- I think not.
- For the flat.

06:36.731 --> 06:39.609
No, it'll be someone like him.
And one's enough, thank you very much.

06:40.651 --> 06:42.070
- What about that girl?
- What girl?

06:42.153 --> 06:43.488
That friend of yours,
the one that came round.

06:43.571 --> 06:46.282
Now, I liked her. We had something.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.701
She could have moved in.
We had, uh, chemistry.

06:48.785 --> 06:50.578
- She hated you.
- Well, she had problems.

06:50.661 --> 06:53.247
- More than anyone she had ever met ‒
- No, I'd be the first one to admit ‒

06:53.331 --> 06:55.083
- in her entire life.
- In all kindness, I would.

06:55.166 --> 06:59.420
But like they say, you know,
she's got to want to change, hasn't she?

07:09.430 --> 07:10.932
You must be Hugo.

07:11.015 --> 07:12.683
And you must be Juliet.

07:12.767 --> 07:14.769
Would you like to come in?

07:14.852 --> 07:16.354
I'd be delighted.

07:23.820 --> 07:25.738
<i>What do you do?</i>

07:25.822 --> 07:27.406
<i>Well, I've been away for a while</i> ‒

07:27.490 --> 07:29.283
<i>uh, traveling, you know,
that kind of thing.</i>

07:29.367 --> 07:31.494
<i>- And now I'm writing a novel.
- Oh.</i>

07:31.577 --> 07:33.287
<i>What's it about?</i>

07:33.371 --> 07:36.666
<i>It's actually about a priest who dies.</i>

07:36.749 --> 07:38.292
<i>I see.</i>

07:38.376 --> 07:40.461
<i>Yeah, maybe you're right.
Maybe I ought to change it.</i>

07:40.545 --> 07:42.630
- No.
- No, no, no. I think you're right.

07:42.713 --> 07:46.134
I mean, who wants to read another story
about a dead priest?

07:46.217 --> 07:49.971
In fact, it's about another guy.
He's not a priest.

07:50.054 --> 07:51.139
And he lives. He doesn't die.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.475
See, it's better already.

07:54.559 --> 07:55.893
Writing seems easy.

07:55.977 --> 07:57.812
Oh, yeah, it's a breeze. No problem.

08:07.071 --> 08:08.823
Do you think you could answer that?

08:10.950 --> 08:13.661
- What, the telephone?
- The telephone, but ‒

08:13.744 --> 08:15.454
If it's for me, I'm not here.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.916
Right. You're not here.

08:21.752 --> 08:22.920
Okay.

08:29.927 --> 08:31.762
Hello?

08:32.763 --> 08:34.682
Uh, yes, it is. Yes.

08:34.765 --> 08:36.683
Who's calling, please?

08:38.269 --> 08:41.522
Well, I'm sorry, but she's not ‒
She's not in right now.

08:42.940 --> 08:46.360
Uh, no, I've got absolutely no idea.

08:46.444 --> 08:48.779
Um, would you like to leave a message?

08:50.448 --> 08:51.866
Okay. Good-bye.

08:56.245 --> 08:59.498
That was, uh, a guy called Brian.

08:59.582 --> 09:02.251
- Did he sound upset?
- A little bit, yeah.

09:02.335 --> 09:04.754
- Is that good or bad?
- It's an improvement.

09:06.714 --> 09:09.258
- Shall I, um, get the phone?
- No, just leave it.

09:09.342 --> 09:11.552
He knows I'm probably at home.
I'm working nights this week.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.013
You're working nights?

09:14.096 --> 09:15.181
I'm a doctor.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.391
Ah, and he's a patient?

09:17.475 --> 09:20.061
No, but he needs treatment.

09:20.144 --> 09:21.896
For what?

09:21.979 --> 09:23.814
A certain weakness.

09:23.898 --> 09:25.107
The human condition?

09:25.191 --> 09:27.860
Oh, you know about it?

09:27.944 --> 09:29.904
Well, I write about it.

09:29.987 --> 09:31.656
And that's not the same thing?

09:32.949 --> 09:36.285
No. But like all novelists,
I'm in search of the self.

09:36.786 --> 09:39.413
<i>Has he tried down the back of the fridge?
That's where I normally find things.</i>

09:39.497 --> 09:41.916
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.919
I'm not saying he didn't seem like a nice guy.

09:45.002 --> 09:48.631
I'm just saying it's a bit strange, you know,
this search of the self or whatever he's on about.

09:48.714 --> 09:51.217
He didn't seem strange, Alex.

09:51.300 --> 09:52.635
He seemed...

09:54.178 --> 09:57.932
you know, interesting.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.517
Interesting?

10:05.481 --> 10:07.608
Interesting?

10:14.198 --> 10:15.616
Hello?

10:15.700 --> 10:17.702
No, she's not in.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.453
I don't know. I've no idea.

10:19.537 --> 10:21.330
Who was it?

10:21.414 --> 10:23.040
I don't know. He sounded Swedish.

10:23.124 --> 10:25.334
- Do you know any Swedish men?
- No.

10:26.877 --> 10:29.046
Maybe it was just the emotion.

10:29.130 --> 10:31.590
- What do you think?
- About what?

10:31.674 --> 10:33.342
About this guy, this Hugo person.

10:33.426 --> 10:35.803
- I don't have the time.
- I'm just asking what you think.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.472
I don't have the time.
I don't care, so long as he's not a freak.

10:38.556 --> 10:42.184
David. It's your mother's handwriting.
I didn't open it.

10:42.268 --> 10:44.645
I don't like reading
about your father's constipation.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.815
- So we'll meet him then.
- What?

10:49.025 --> 10:50.735
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.530
I tell you, every letter
this guy writes you is the same.

10:54.613 --> 10:58.451
They all begin like true love
and descend into open pornography.

10:58.534 --> 10:59.952
"I dream of your thighs...

11:00.036 --> 11:02.413
the touch of your white skin
leading me in desire...

11:02.496 --> 11:04.540
- while I, aroused and inflamed" ‒
- Alex.

11:04.623 --> 11:06.292
Aroused and inflamed?

11:12.840 --> 11:15.593
Even signs them in his own name.
Can you believe that?

11:15.676 --> 11:17.511
I'd sign someone else's.
I'd sign his name ‒

11:17.595 --> 11:19.680
if I wrote them, that is, which I don't.

11:20.681 --> 11:22.266
<i>- "Interesting."</i>
- Really?

11:22.350 --> 11:24.435
Yes, well, that's what she said.
"Interesting."

11:24.518 --> 11:26.354
You see, that's why you're here.

11:26.437 --> 11:29.523
Normally, I don't usually meet people
unless I already know them.

11:29.607 --> 11:32.276
- Oh, I see.
- People can be so cruel.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.695
So, um ‒

11:34.779 --> 11:36.781
Well, uh, we think it's fine.

11:38.032 --> 11:40.326
Ah. So I can have the room?

11:40.409 --> 11:41.952
Yes, you can have the room.

11:42.036 --> 11:43.704
Oh. I'm not usually drunk.

11:43.788 --> 11:46.290
- Not usually this drunk.
- Only on expenses.

11:46.374 --> 11:48.125
No, it's true.
A newspaper is paying for all this.

11:48.209 --> 11:49.752
In a moment he's going to tell you
he could have been someone ‒

11:49.835 --> 11:51.545
- It was you, Juliet. It was you.
- instead of what he is, which is ‒

11:51.629 --> 11:53.881
- What I am, which is a hack.
- the man we know and love.

11:53.964 --> 11:56.217
Miserable, tired out, empty shell of a ‒
"Know and love"?

11:56.300 --> 11:57.301
Yeah.

11:58.260 --> 12:01.389
- I think you're lying.
- You're right.

12:01.472 --> 12:02.765
You see, they don't really know me.

12:02.848 --> 12:05.643
No, Alex. We don't really love you.

12:09.814 --> 12:12.149
Can you afford this place?

12:12.233 --> 12:13.109
Oh, yeah.

12:19.156 --> 12:22.034
- Can I ask you a question?
- Certainly.

12:24.829 --> 12:26.163
Have you ever killed a man?

12:34.338 --> 12:35.423
No.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.763
Well, that's fair enough then.

12:52.106 --> 12:54.275
Well, it certainly smells like the real thing.

14:04.512 --> 14:08.015
<i>Rangers have made
a few dramatic comebacks this season...</i>

14:08.098 --> 14:12.353
<i>but they'll really have to draw
on all of their resource</i> ‒

14:14.104 --> 14:17.525
<i>Scotland today can reveal</i> ‒

14:17.608 --> 14:19.360
- Have you seen Hugo?
- No.

14:20.611 --> 14:23.239
Any idea which channel he's on?

14:23.322 --> 14:26.158
<i>... For the High Court in Edinburgh</i> ‒

14:26.242 --> 14:29.036
Oh, for fuck's sake!

14:36.502 --> 14:38.128
No, she's not in!

14:48.847 --> 14:50.224
- Have you seen him?
- I don't have the time.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.600
Yes or no?

14:51.684 --> 14:53.018
Yes or no?

14:53.102 --> 14:54.812
- Oh, David, yes or ‒
- No!

14:58.691 --> 15:01.235
- David hasn't seen him either.
- So I gathered.

15:01.318 --> 15:03.195
- Maybe he didn't like us.
- David?

15:03.279 --> 15:06.824
- No. Hugo.
- His car's still there.

15:06.907 --> 15:10.369
- He's got a car?
- Yeah. What's wrong with that?

15:10.452 --> 15:13.330
- What sort of car?
- I don't know, Alex. I'm just a girl.

15:13.414 --> 15:15.666
Oh, look, I'll ask you just once more.
What sort of car?

15:15.749 --> 15:17.251
A blue one. Okay?

15:17.334 --> 15:19.003
And it's still there.

15:34.018 --> 15:37.354
Yeah, Hugo, look, I'm sorry about this,
but can you open your door?

15:37.438 --> 15:40.858
It's us, your flatmates and companions.
Your newfound friends.

15:43.694 --> 15:45.571
He's not there.
I can't see him at all.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.114
Maybe he's in the wardrobe?

15:47.197 --> 15:49.366
Of course he's not in the bloody wardrobe.

15:49.450 --> 15:51.243
It was a joke, Alex.

15:51.327 --> 15:54.580
Well, I think he's probably left.
We'll probably never see him again.

15:54.663 --> 15:55.956
Alex.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.542
The key is in the keyhole
on the other side.

15:58.626 --> 16:01.420
- So?
- Open it.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.130
- You want me to kick this in?
- Yeah.

16:03.213 --> 16:04.798
- Now?
- Yeah.

16:04.882 --> 16:06.216
Okay, no problem.

16:14.725 --> 16:16.226
Do you want a go?

16:19.605 --> 16:21.649
Okay, you size that up.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.468
Is this what they always look like?

16:49.551 --> 16:50.886
Yes.

16:52.096 --> 16:55.641
- Wonder how he did it.
- Did what?

16:55.724 --> 16:58.185
Well, killed himself.
I presume that's what's happened.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.065
What do you think?

17:03.148 --> 17:06.026
- Alex!
- What? What's wrong?

17:06.109 --> 17:07.736
- What are you doing?
- I'm just looking.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.696
- Don't.
- Don't look?

17:09.780 --> 17:11.448
- No.
- Why not?

17:11.531 --> 17:13.492
What's wrong, Juliet?
Aren't you curious?

17:13.575 --> 17:15.368
- Don't you wonder what he died from?
- No.

17:15.452 --> 17:17.413
The guy's dead. What more do you need?

17:20.790 --> 17:23.419
It's not every day
I find a story in my own flat.

17:23.502 --> 17:26.380
It's not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.553
I've never seen a dead body before.

17:43.355 --> 17:45.733
I saw my grandmother, of course,
but I don't suppose that counts.

17:45.816 --> 17:49.486
I mean... she was alive at the time.

18:06.170 --> 18:07.671
Can I show you something?

18:20.517 --> 18:22.644
<i>Emergency. Which service?</i>

18:24.396 --> 18:26.273
<i>Emergency. Which</i> ‒

18:31.528 --> 18:32.529
No.

18:33.614 --> 18:35.324
- Just think about it.
- No.

18:35.407 --> 18:37.534
- Come on, David.
- No.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.453
Juliet.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.538
- No, Alex. It's ‒
- It's what?

18:42.498 --> 18:44.458
- Unfeasible.
- Oh, is that all?

18:44.541 --> 18:46.877
- You mean immoral.
- I know what I mean.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.296
Look, I'm only asking you both
to think about it.

18:49.379 --> 18:51.465
It's a sick idea, Alex. It's sick.

18:51.548 --> 18:54.051
Yeah, but don't tell me you're not tempted.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.303
Don't tell me you're not interested.
I know you well enough.

18:56.386 --> 18:57.888
Oh, you think so?

19:05.187 --> 19:06.897
Well, go ahead then, telephone.

19:08.565 --> 19:10.901
Telephone the police.

19:12.486 --> 19:15.113
Go ahead.
No one's gonna stand in your way.

19:15.197 --> 19:17.324
Telephone and tell them.

19:17.407 --> 19:21.787
Tell 'em there's a suitcase full of money
and you don't want it.

20:29.104 --> 20:32.983
Yeah, a pet. You know, like a dog
or a budgie or a gerbil or something.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.944
You see, what I need here is...

20:36.028 --> 20:39.323
"P.C. Plod Saves Harry the Hamster

20:42.534 --> 20:46.663
All right. Well, that's a pity.
You see, no pets, no human angle.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.167
You're such a flirt.

20:58.675 --> 21:00.594

21:02.846 --> 21:05.891

21:05.974 --> 21:07.768
- That one last week.
- Here?

21:07.851 --> 21:10.687
- Yes, here. Where else?
- Oh, him.

21:12.022 --> 21:14.858

- That's what I thought.

When are you gonna let the police know?

21:54.439 --> 21:56.233
Well, you phone them if you want, David.

21:57.484 --> 22:00.654

What is it we do here, David?

22:27.597 --> 22:28.348
Sorry?

22:28.432 --> 22:30.225
- Here.
- Right here?

22:30.308 --> 22:32.269
In this firm.

22:33.270 --> 22:34.896
Well, it's a wide range of, uh ‒

22:34.980 --> 22:36.898
Accounting, David.

22:36.982 --> 22:39.192
- Chartered accounting ‒
- Exactly what I was ‒

22:39.276 --> 22:42.195
is often sneered at.
Were you aware of that?

22:42.279 --> 22:44.239
Not any real sneering as such, no.

22:44.322 --> 22:46.366
There's a whole wide world out there...

22:46.450 --> 22:48.785
and it all needs to be accounted for,
does it not?

22:49.786 --> 22:50.871
Well, I ‒

22:50.954 --> 22:53.248
- But they sneer, do they not?
- I'm not sure.

22:53.331 --> 22:56.209
Oh, it's unfashionable, I know,
but, yes, we're methodical.

22:56.293 --> 22:58.378
Yes, we're diligent.
Yes, we're serious.

22:58.462 --> 23:00.130
And where's the crime in that?

23:00.213 --> 23:02.215
Why not shout it from the rooftops?

23:02.299 --> 23:04.217
Yes, maybe sometimes
we're a wee bit boring...

23:04.301 --> 23:06.428
but, by God, we get the job done.

23:06.511 --> 23:08.388
Yes, sir.

23:08.472 --> 23:10.474
Now, that's why I think you fit in here.

23:11.767 --> 23:12.559
I'm boring?

23:12.642 --> 23:15.145
You get the job done.

23:15.228 --> 23:16.396
Oh, I see. I thought you meant ‒

23:16.480 --> 23:18.982
Which is why I'm trusting you with this client.

23:51.723 --> 23:53.433
Good morning.
Lumsden, Lumsden Associates.

23:53.517 --> 23:55.060
Can I help you?

23:55.143 --> 23:56.645
Yeah, I'll just check that for you.

24:20.710 --> 24:21.878
Let's do it.

24:23.547 --> 24:25.215
<i>Good. Let's talk about disposal.</i>

24:25.298 --> 24:27.634
<i>Now, we have to make that body unidentifiable.</i>

24:27.717 --> 24:31.138
<i>And burning, dumping at sea
and straightforward burial are all flawed</i> ‒

24:31.221 --> 24:33.515
<i>either by fingerprints
or, more commonly, by dental records.</i>

24:33.598 --> 24:35.142
<i>This I have learned.</i>

24:35.225 --> 24:37.978
<i>Now what I suggest
is that we bury him out in the forest.</i>

24:38.061 --> 24:41.189
<i>But first of all, we remove his hands and his feet,
which we incinerate.</i>

24:41.690 --> 24:44.109
<i>And his teeth</i> ‒ <i>which we just remove.</i>

24:44.192 --> 24:45.694
<i>It's as simple as that.</i>

24:45.777 --> 24:47.529
David.

24:47.612 --> 24:50.240
I've always wondered what these were for.

24:50.323 --> 24:52.200
Now ‒

24:53.243 --> 24:56.163
Oh, this is what we need.

24:57.539 --> 24:58.623
And, um ‒

24:58.707 --> 25:00.167
<i>Gary to the service desk, please.</i>

25:00.250 --> 25:02.335
And this.

25:02.419 --> 25:04.171
- And what else?
- I don't know.

25:04.254 --> 25:06.006
A spade. We need a spade.

25:06.089 --> 25:08.884
David, I wish you'd concentrate.
We need a spade if we're gonna dig a pit.

25:08.967 --> 25:11.011
- So, who's gonna do it?
- Dig the pit? I don't know.

25:11.094 --> 25:13.054
- No, not that.
- Then what? Who's gonna do what?

25:13.138 --> 25:15.015
You know what I'm talking about.
Who's gonna do it?

25:15.098 --> 25:17.309
Do I? What? What are you talking about?

25:17.392 --> 25:19.269
You know what.
Who's gonna do it?

25:19.352 --> 25:21.897
We all are, David.
We're all gonna do it ‒ each of us.

25:21.980 --> 25:23.857
You, me and Juliet
will do his or her bit, okay?

25:23.940 --> 25:26.401
- Fair enough?
- I can't do it.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.778
- I don't hear this.
- I won't be able to do it.

25:28.862 --> 25:30.697
Are you telling me
you want out already?

25:30.780 --> 25:32.115
Are you telling me
you don't want the money?

25:32.199 --> 25:34.034
- Hugo is going off. He smells.
- Shh!

25:34.117 --> 25:36.203
The flat smells.
We can't wait any longer.

25:36.286 --> 25:38.955
I'm just telling you
I won't be able to cut him up.

25:54.971 --> 25:57.599
- Who's going to do it?
- Well, I thought we all were.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.894
I don't think I can.

26:00.977 --> 26:03.396
But, Juliet, you're a doctor.
You kill people every day.

26:03.480 --> 26:04.606
That's different.

26:04.689 --> 26:06.441
I still don't want to.

26:07.317 --> 26:09.236
And now you tell me.

26:32.842 --> 26:34.427
There's something I want to ask.

26:35.053 --> 26:37.806
I don't know!
I swear to God I don't know!

26:40.392 --> 26:42.936
Family? Friends?

26:43.019 --> 26:44.813
Drugged-up, wandering, suicidal...

26:44.896 --> 26:47.774
search-for-the-self fuck-ups
don't have families, David!

26:47.857 --> 26:50.026
- I just thought we should discuss it.
- Take his legs!

26:55.907 --> 26:58.034
Where's Hugo?

27:05.166 --> 27:06.626
It's all right.

27:06.710 --> 27:08.211
Fuck!

27:16.761 --> 27:18.305
I can't see what's happening.

27:23.435 --> 27:24.519
What are you doin'?

27:24.602 --> 27:27.147
Let me past. Let me past.

27:41.161 --> 27:43.163
Okay. Take your time.

27:49.336 --> 27:51.087
- Pick him up!
- Shh!

27:51.171 --> 27:53.673
Pick him up. Pick him up!

27:53.757 --> 27:55.258
Shh!

27:58.094 --> 28:01.097
I swear to God I don't know!
I don't know!

28:53.483 --> 28:56.236
Stupid fuckin' bastard.

29:04.869 --> 29:07.205
Why don't we draw lots for it?

29:07.288 --> 29:09.249
Whoever draws the short straw does it all.

29:09.332 --> 29:11.709
That way, you either do it or you don't.
All or nothing.

29:11.793 --> 29:13.253
Okay. I can go with that.

29:13.336 --> 29:16.214
- David?
- I don't know.

29:16.297 --> 29:17.924
Look, if I draw the short straw,
then I'll do it.

29:18.007 --> 29:20.427
But I'm not going to do it
just because you won't.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.721
All right then.
Here we are, and this is it.

30:05.889 --> 30:07.974
Do you want to play or not?

30:46.137 --> 30:47.889
I can't do it.

31:30.473 --> 31:32.433
I've finished.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.811
Aye, but not quite.

31:35.311 --> 31:36.813
Is that gonna be deep enough?

31:36.896 --> 31:38.648
Don't worry about that.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.692
- Is this necessary?
- Yes!

31:40.775 --> 31:42.485
Now come on. All or nothing!

32:30.241 --> 32:31.868
Are you all right?

32:31.951 --> 32:34.621
Oh, yes, I'm fine, thanks. Just fine.

32:34.704 --> 32:36.497
- Would you like to talk about it?
- No.

32:57.226 --> 33:00.188
<i>These three people get their chance to...</i>

33:02.607 --> 33:03.608
<i>lose a million.</i>

33:26.089 --> 33:27.757
<i>Yes, all right.</i>

33:27.840 --> 33:30.468
<i>Hello there and welcome aboard once again
onto the millionaire's yacht.</i>

33:30.551 --> 33:33.262
<i>As you can see, it's just like
the</i> Mary Celeste <i>really...</i>

33:33.346 --> 33:35.181
<i>but without the party atmosphere.</i>

33:35.264 --> 33:38.685
<i>As you know, on</i> Lose A Million,
<i>the object is not to win the game...</i>

33:38.768 --> 33:41.229
<i>- but to</i> ‒
- Lose.

33:41.312 --> 33:45.483
- Not to give right answers, but ‒
- Wrong ones.

33:45.566 --> 33:49.320
<i>- Not to do well, but to do really</i> ‒
- Badly.

33:49.404 --> 33:53.074
<i>- And above all, to try and make a total</i> ‒
- Hotchpotch.

34:02.125 --> 34:03.751
Be careful.

34:23.688 --> 34:25.148
Alex!

34:32.321 --> 34:35.574
I don't know why we couldn't just stuff it
in a mattress or under the floorboards...

34:35.658 --> 34:36.951
like any other human being.

34:37.034 --> 34:38.536
Stop nagging, Alex.

34:38.619 --> 34:40.705
We could have hid it in the fridge.

35:38.179 --> 35:40.139
Whoo!

35:57.406 --> 35:58.574
Ladies and gentlemen.

35:59.826 --> 36:02.495
Could I have your attention, please?

36:02.578 --> 36:05.331
First of all, I'd like to thank you all
for coming here tonight...

36:05.414 --> 36:08.209
to help us raise funds
for the Sick Children's Unit.

36:11.337 --> 36:14.298
You never told me this was for children.
I hate children.

36:14.382 --> 36:16.342
I'd raise money
to have the little fuckers put down.

36:16.425 --> 36:17.051
Shh!

36:17.134 --> 36:18.761
Oi! I want my money back!

36:19.762 --> 36:21.264
Right.

36:21.347 --> 36:23.516
But before the dancing starts,
ladies and gentlemen ‒

36:23.599 --> 36:24.559
Excuse me!

36:24.642 --> 36:26.853
I would like to pay tribute to,
to give a vote of thanks...

36:26.936 --> 36:32.108
to the few people who have worked so hard
to make this occasion actually happen.

36:32.191 --> 36:34.443
- I'm referring, of course ‒
- Do you know many of these people?

36:34.527 --> 36:35.987
Yes, they're my friends.

36:36.070 --> 36:38.656
Oh, so if they want to speak to you,
we tell them that you're not here.

36:40.616 --> 36:42.326
But, ladies and gentlemen ‒

36:42.410 --> 36:46.247
and those of you who are neither ‒
or both ‒

36:47.623 --> 36:49.876
- Where did they dig him up?
- Make your way to the dance floor ‒

36:49.959 --> 36:52.253
and form sets for strip the willow.

36:54.922 --> 36:57.216
- Are we going to dance?
- Well, it's physical contact, isn't it?

38:15.586 --> 38:17.421
Okay.

38:17.505 --> 38:19.799
Talk to me.

38:19.882 --> 38:23.302
Talk to me.

38:26.389 --> 38:28.307
Okay. Give me a hand.

38:28.391 --> 38:31.060
No, man! Don't! Please don't, man!

38:31.143 --> 38:32.561
Please don't, man!

38:32.645 --> 38:35.189
No! No! No, man! Please!

38:35.272 --> 38:37.358
No, man! Don't!

38:37.441 --> 38:39.652
Please! Please! Don't!

38:39.735 --> 38:41.821
Please! Let me out!

38:49.745 --> 38:52.748
Oh, my God!

38:56.585 --> 38:59.338
- Listen, can we talk about something?
- Not now. I have an idea.

38:59.422 --> 39:01.132
It's important. We need to decide ‒

39:01.215 --> 39:02.925
Will you just stop worrying?

39:06.887 --> 39:10.016
To love and to happiness forever.

39:10.099 --> 39:12.059
Forever and ever!

39:17.857 --> 39:19.775
- What's wrong?
- I want to talk. Now.

39:19.859 --> 39:22.236
Not until you've drunk to love
and happiness forever.

39:22.319 --> 39:23.487
- Now!
- After!

39:23.571 --> 39:26.240
David, I promise we will.
Just keep him happy.

39:26.323 --> 39:29.452
It's not for me.
It's for love and happiness forever.

39:37.001 --> 39:38.711
Look over there!

39:38.794 --> 39:40.212
- It's Cameron.
- Who?

39:40.296 --> 39:42.381
- Cameron. You remember Cameron.
- No, I don't.

39:42.465 --> 39:44.050
- What's he doing here?
- That's not him.

39:44.133 --> 39:45.885
It is. Cameron!

39:45.968 --> 39:48.304
Cameron! Come on over here.
Come on!

39:50.806 --> 39:51.807
What?

39:54.143 --> 39:57.563
Nothing. We thought you were someone else.

39:57.646 --> 39:59.899
Good luck!

39:59.982 --> 40:02.109
I love that guy, but why does he
have to follow us around?

40:02.193 --> 40:04.445
Anyway, what I was wanting
to say was this ‒

40:04.528 --> 40:07.073
Aha! The divine Juliet.

40:07.156 --> 40:08.282
Long time no see.

40:08.365 --> 40:10.284
- Brian.
- Would you care to dance?

40:10.367 --> 40:12.411
Hold on there.
Who do you think you are?

40:12.495 --> 40:14.497
- What?
- Who do you think you are?

40:14.580 --> 40:17.875
- You interrupted us.
- Why, I'm Brian McKinley.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.418
And who are you?

40:19.502 --> 40:24.715
Well, Brian McKinley, if you want to talk
to my girlfriend, you talk to me first.

40:24.799 --> 40:27.760
If you want to dance with her,
you apply in writing three weeks in advance...

40:27.843 --> 40:30.513
or you're gonna end up
inside a fucking binbag!

40:30.596 --> 40:32.807
You didn't apply, so you don't dance!

40:40.689 --> 40:43.651
Do you think you could be
a little more forceful next time?

40:43.734 --> 40:44.610
I'm sorry.

40:44.693 --> 40:46.737
No. No, I think he got the message.

40:48.197 --> 40:50.491
That was quite stressful.
I found that quite stressful.

40:50.574 --> 40:52.993
Yeah, but you were good.
He was really good.

40:53.077 --> 40:55.037
"Fucking binbag." I liked that.

40:55.121 --> 40:57.832
You really explored your maleness
to the full there.

40:58.999 --> 41:01.877
- Do you think so?
- Well, you certainly had a good look around.

41:01.961 --> 41:03.629
You were magnificent.

41:06.340 --> 41:07.842
Yeah.

41:08.634 --> 41:09.885
"Fucking binbag"!

41:34.743 --> 41:37.288
"Fucking binbag."

41:42.835 --> 41:45.504
Cameron! What a surprise!

42:36.931 --> 42:38.265
Hello?

42:40.601 --> 42:42.436
Hello?

42:50.444 --> 42:53.072
- Who was it?
- Don't know.

42:53.155 --> 42:55.324
No one said anything.

42:55.407 --> 42:57.910
What, rendered speechless with desire?

42:57.993 --> 43:01.038
I recall that feeling from the days
when I had such a thing.

43:02.206 --> 43:04.792
- Are you all right?
- No.

43:07.670 --> 43:09.421
Then let's spend some money.

43:12.925 --> 43:14.385
<i>Hello.</i>

43:14.468 --> 43:17.554
<i>It's been a struggle,
but now our days of worry are over.</i>

43:17.638 --> 43:21.433
<i>The light at the end of the tunnel
has expanded into a golden sunrise.</i>

43:21.517 --> 43:24.979
<i>And now, at last</i> ‒ <i>at long last</i> ‒

43:25.062 --> 43:27.189
<i>nothing will ever be the same again.</i>

43:37.116 --> 43:38.784
Whoa!

43:44.248 --> 43:46.667
Excuse me. Where's the beast?

44:14.987 --> 44:18.615
<i>This is Alex Law reporting
on the video diary of his own life.</i>

44:18.699 --> 44:20.868
<i>Let me tell you,
I'm so happy, I could die.</i>

44:29.168 --> 44:31.920
I think we ought to scrub this, don't you?

44:33.172 --> 44:34.673
Oh, will you relax?

44:34.757 --> 44:36.800
You'll be making <i>us</i> all nervous.

44:36.884 --> 44:38.385
- How much did you pay for this?
- I don't know.

44:38.469 --> 44:39.511
- How much?
- I don't know.

44:39.595 --> 44:40.929
- How much?
- I can't remember.

44:41.013 --> 44:42.931
- How much? Tell me how much you paid for it.
- I don't know. I can't remember.

44:43.015 --> 44:45.059
- How much did you pay for this?
- I don't know, David.

44:45.142 --> 44:45.893
- How much?
- No idea.

44:45.976 --> 44:48.103
- How much did you pay?
- I don't know. I don't know!

44:48.187 --> 44:49.688
How much did you pay for this?

44:49.772 --> 44:50.898
£500.

44:50.981 --> 44:53.525
- £500?
- £500.

44:53.609 --> 44:55.778
You paid £500 for this?

44:57.279 --> 44:59.073
That's what it cost, David.

44:59.156 --> 45:00.866
No, no. That's what you paid for it.

45:00.949 --> 45:02.993
£500 is what you paid for it.

45:03.077 --> 45:05.287
We don't know how much it cost us yet.

45:06.455 --> 45:10.125
For you two to have a good time,
we don't know the cost of that yet.

45:49.164 --> 45:51.583
What were they doing?

45:53.877 --> 45:55.838
Excuse me. Did they take anything?

46:06.223 --> 46:07.975
<i>Is that enough for you?</i>

46:08.517 --> 46:10.686
- Oi.
- What?

46:10.769 --> 46:13.605
- Is that enough for you?
- Yes, that's fine.

46:13.689 --> 46:15.399
There's plenty more.

46:15.482 --> 46:16.984
That's fine.

46:24.158 --> 46:25.659
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

46:25.742 --> 46:27.619
- You're not eating.
- Not eating what?

46:27.703 --> 46:30.539
- Well, you're not eating like you used to.
- If you give me the plate, I'll eat.

46:47.139 --> 46:48.891
Now swallow.

46:54.605 --> 46:57.024
You should spend some of that money
instead of worrying about it.

46:57.107 --> 46:59.985
- That's my advice.
- He's right. You'd feel so much better about it all.

47:00.068 --> 47:02.070
Once it's spent,
you don't have to worry about it.

47:02.154 --> 47:03.947
- Be like a weight off your shoulders.
- You know we're right.

47:04.031 --> 47:06.742
- Don't you?
- I want to secure it.

47:06.825 --> 47:10.662
Secure it? What, you want to put it in a bank?
You don't wanna put it in a bank, do you?

47:10.746 --> 47:14.541
- What, do you want to bury it? Is that it?
- Oh, I don't see the point in that. It's stupid.

47:14.625 --> 47:16.919
Of course it's stupid.
Look. We did what we did. We took the money.

47:17.002 --> 47:18.670
It was a material calculation.

47:19.713 --> 47:23.342
What's the point if it's underground
in some funny bank in some funny place?

47:23.425 --> 47:27.221
If you can't have it,
if you can't spend it, then what use is it? None.

47:27.304 --> 47:29.056
It's all for nothing if you do that.

47:29.139 --> 47:32.059
Now I didn't get into this for nothing,
so that I could have nothing.

47:32.142 --> 47:34.436
Yeah, and you didn't saw his feet off.

47:43.445 --> 47:45.239
Tastes different.

48:18.063 --> 48:20.315
David, what are you doing up there?

48:27.197 --> 48:30.701
Will you come down now? It's not safe up there.

48:41.503 --> 48:43.463
Are you listening to me?

48:45.007 --> 48:48.343
Security and insanity are not the same thing.

48:53.515 --> 48:55.017
Shit.

49:34.890 --> 49:38.310
<i>I don't care what you say.
A grown man shouldn't be living in a loft.</i>

49:38.393 --> 49:40.062
<i>He isn't safe up there.</i>

49:40.145 --> 49:43.315
If you cared about him at all,
then you'd use your influence to get him down.

49:43.398 --> 49:46.151
- Then he'd be safe.
- And the money?

49:46.234 --> 49:48.904
- Well, we could put it somewhere.
- Where he can't get it.

49:50.572 --> 49:52.991
Well, you thought of that, not me.

49:53.075 --> 49:56.036
Forget it. He'll come down.

49:57.245 --> 49:59.164
Oh, Juliet, look.

50:17.265 --> 50:20.352
Hello, Mr. Lumsden.
It's David Stephens here.

50:20.435 --> 50:23.522
I'm sorry, sir.
I won't be able to make it to the office today.

50:23.605 --> 50:27.442
It's my mother, sir. She's very ill,
and I think I need to be with her just now.

50:28.860 --> 50:32.280
I don't know. The doctors aren't sure.
It could go either way.

50:33.281 --> 50:36.368
Yes, sir, I'll certainly stay in touch.

51:10.444 --> 51:12.571
- Good day?
- What?

51:12.654 --> 51:14.990
- Good day?
- What are you talking about?

51:15.073 --> 51:18.243
- I'm just asking if you had a good day at work.
- Why?

51:18.326 --> 51:21.079
Well, I thought I'd make conversation.

51:21.163 --> 51:25.667
Please, I'd rather you didn't.

51:25.751 --> 51:27.878
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.

51:27.961 --> 51:30.922
- Oh.
- Aren't you going to answer it?

51:31.006 --> 51:33.133
Well, I'm not expecting anyone either.

52:37.572 --> 52:41.409
It's in the loft! In the loft!

55:55.186 --> 55:59.024
September the 19th, direct flight,
London Heathrow to Rio de Janeiro.

55:59.107 --> 56:02.986
It's British Airways.
You're lookin' at £765. That's 7-6-5.

56:03.111 --> 56:07.490
- That sounds fine.
- Air Portugal, on the other hand, that's via Lisbon.

56:07.574 --> 56:11.036
Same day, it's £565. 5-6-5.

56:11.119 --> 56:13.038
- Is catering important?
- What?

56:13.121 --> 56:15.290
Air France, Glasgow direct.

56:15.373 --> 56:19.085
But then you're looking at
the wrong end of £912. That's 9-1-2.

56:19.169 --> 56:22.589
- The first one was fine. Heathrow direct.
- That's up to you.

56:22.672 --> 56:25.508
Air Patagonia ‒ that's a new outfit. Via ‒

56:25.592 --> 56:27.594
Well, via lots of different places really.

56:27.677 --> 56:31.306
Well, it's no catering. That's £411. 4-1-1.

56:31.389 --> 56:34.225
It's good value,
but refueling at Bogotá is variable.

56:34.309 --> 56:36.102
The first one was fine.

56:36.186 --> 56:38.354
Oh, it's up to you.

56:38.438 --> 56:41.399
7-6-5. How will you be paying?

57:03.088 --> 57:04.631
<i>Oh, God!</i>

57:04.714 --> 57:06.674
<i>Oh, Jesus Christ!</i>

57:15.600 --> 57:17.644
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

57:18.394 --> 57:19.854
<i>Christ!</i>

57:20.688 --> 57:24.275
<i>No, no!
Dear God! No! Christ!</i>

58:03.481 --> 58:06.651
No, and that's it.
I refuse to discuss it any further.

58:06.734 --> 58:08.486
- It's the only way.
- No, I refuse.

58:08.570 --> 58:10.488
- You're frightened!
- I'm not frightened.

58:10.572 --> 58:12.407
I'm a little terrified maybe.

58:12.490 --> 58:15.160
Did you see what happened
to the last two people that tried to do that?

58:15.243 --> 58:17.871
They went up there alive,
and they came back down dead.

58:17.954 --> 58:20.290
Did you notice that? The difference, I mean.

58:20.373 --> 58:22.333
Alive, dead. Dead, alive. That sort of thing.

58:22.417 --> 58:24.669
It wasn't difficult to spot.

58:25.753 --> 58:28.214
He killed them both.

58:28.298 --> 58:29.924
He cut them up!

58:30.008 --> 58:32.051
Yeah, but you'll be all right.

58:33.011 --> 58:37.265
- And how's that?
- Because you're smarter than he is.

58:39.100 --> 58:42.145
Yeah, well, that's what I've always thought.

59:10.215 --> 59:14.302
Good evening. I'm Detective Inspector McCall.
This is D.C. Mitchell.

59:14.385 --> 59:16.471
I wonder if we could ask you some questions.

59:16.554 --> 59:19.307
- What about?
- It's about the burglary.

59:19.390 --> 59:22.560
- Burglary?
- Downstairs.

59:22.644 --> 59:24.229
Of course.

59:25.605 --> 59:27.106
Can we come in?

59:27.190 --> 59:29.901
So I just heard her cries for help and all that.

59:29.984 --> 59:33.238
And when I went downstairs,
there were already those other people there...

59:33.321 --> 59:37.367
so I just stood around,
you know, waiting, the way people do.

59:37.450 --> 59:40.578
And when your colleagues arrived,
I came back upstairs.

59:40.662 --> 59:42.288
That's about all, I think.

59:42.372 --> 59:45.124
I didn't actually see anything useful,
I don't think.

59:45.208 --> 59:48.628
And the other three people living in the flat ‒
did they hear anything?

59:48.711 --> 59:50.672
There are only two other people in the flat.

59:59.764 --> 01:00:02.600
- Two?
- Who said there were four?

01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:06.521
We understood there were
four people living here.

01:00:06.604 --> 01:00:08.940
Not always, of course, but now. Four.

01:00:09.023 --> 01:00:11.109
No. Three. Who said there were four?

01:00:11.192 --> 01:00:13.444
How strange.

01:00:13.528 --> 01:00:16.447
And how unsatisfactory
to have misleading information.

01:00:16.531 --> 01:00:19.951
Only three people here ‒ you're sure?

01:00:20.034 --> 01:00:23.788
Yes, absolutely. Who said there were four?

01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:25.790
Make a note of that, Mitchell.

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:28.960
Only three rather than four.
Write it down.

01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:31.337
You can use numbers or words.
I've no preference.

01:00:31.421 --> 01:00:34.382
- Which are you using?
- Both, sir.

01:00:35.049 --> 01:00:37.010
Excellent.

01:00:38.219 --> 01:00:41.180
D.C. Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stephens.

01:00:41.264 --> 01:00:45.351
Under my tutelage,
he will undoubtedly make the grade.

01:00:45.435 --> 01:00:46.477
I see.

01:00:46.561 --> 01:00:48.730
I doubt it.

01:00:50.565 --> 01:00:52.734
- And you'll wait in the hall.
- I'll wait there.

01:00:52.817 --> 01:00:54.736
And if it sounds like
I'm getting killed or anything...

01:00:54.819 --> 01:00:57.155
- you'll call the police and tell them everything.
- Everything.

01:00:57.238 --> 01:01:00.325
Except maybe that it was
his idea in the first place.

01:01:00.408 --> 01:01:02.827
Now that's important to me.
I need to die misunderstood.

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:04.620
- Alex.
- What?

01:01:04.704 --> 01:01:07.206
As smart as you are,
you might need a little help.

01:01:11.419 --> 01:01:13.838
Now, David, what I'm gonna do is...

01:01:13.921 --> 01:01:16.007
I'm gonna open this lock...

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:18.009
and I'm gonna come up.

01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:21.346
But what's really important
is that you remain calm.

01:01:21.429 --> 01:01:22.930
Okay?

01:02:08.643 --> 01:02:10.561
Alex!

01:02:11.104 --> 01:02:13.356
It's all right. It's just a pigeon.

01:02:28.788 --> 01:02:30.665
Well, he isn't up here.

01:02:35.878 --> 01:02:38.840
Tell him to look for the money.

01:02:45.888 --> 01:02:47.807
Look for the money.

01:02:47.890 --> 01:02:50.184
Don't worry.
That's exactly what I'm doing.

01:03:02.572 --> 01:03:05.867
It's not up here. He <i>has</i> eaten it.

01:03:30.766 --> 01:03:33.060
You looking for me?

01:03:34.145 --> 01:03:35.855
Looking for you, yeah.

01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:40.067
What for?
What did you want? The money? Was that it?

01:03:40.151 --> 01:03:42.320
We just wanted to talk to you.

01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:45.573
Who else have you just wanted to talk to?

01:03:46.908 --> 01:03:49.160
- Maybe you thought they'd already got me.
- Who?

01:03:49.243 --> 01:03:50.495
Your friends.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:54.832
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:03:56.751 --> 01:03:59.170
He doesn't know, David.

01:04:03.466 --> 01:04:05.343
Maybe you don't.

01:04:07.178 --> 01:04:09.597
I'm talking about the police.

01:07:38.681 --> 01:07:41.058
I thought you'd gone to work.

01:07:42.852 --> 01:07:45.146
With a face like this?

01:08:02.830 --> 01:08:05.166
Alex, the editor wants to see you.

01:08:15.217 --> 01:08:17.136
I'm sorry.

01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:19.180
So you should be.

01:08:22.725 --> 01:08:25.185
Maybe we can still sort everything out.

01:08:31.358 --> 01:08:33.277
Well, we can certainly try.

01:08:37.865 --> 01:08:40.533
Three bodies, decomposed.

01:08:40.618 --> 01:08:42.787
Mutilated beyond recognition.

01:08:42.870 --> 01:08:46.457
- I don't know anything about it.
- Of course you don't know anything about it.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:50.419
If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't
have to send you out there to cover it.

01:08:50.502 --> 01:08:52.712
- Cover it?
- That's right.

01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:55.341
- This is your break, son.
- Cover it?

01:08:59.220 --> 01:09:01.138
Jesus.

01:10:34.398 --> 01:10:36.358
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:36.442 --> 01:10:40.654
The releasable and print-worthy
facts of the day so far are as follows.

01:10:40.738 --> 01:10:43.657
Late yesterday afternoon,
forestry workers came across...

01:10:43.741 --> 01:10:48.078
one set of human remains lying in a grave
which appeared to have been recently dug.

01:10:48.162 --> 01:10:51.749
Further excavation on our part
revealed another, deeper grave...

01:10:51.832 --> 01:10:53.626
containing two sets of human remains.

01:10:53.751 --> 01:10:56.629
<i>- Is this a serial killer?
- How come they haven't been identified yet?</i>

01:10:56.712 --> 01:10:58.714
<i>How long have they been in the ground?</i>

01:11:00.215 --> 01:11:04.094
<i>- Any obvious motive yet?
-  - Is it true that one of the bodies had been skinned?</i>

01:11:04.178 --> 01:11:06.931
- Not entirely.
- Oh, come on, Ken.

01:11:07.014 --> 01:11:08.807
All right, all right.

01:11:08.891 --> 01:11:13.020
<i>An area of skin has been removed,
and you'd better keep this to yourselves.</i>

01:11:13.103 --> 01:11:15.689
<i>There's no hands, no feet, no teeth.</i>

01:11:15.773 --> 01:11:17.858
<i>The faces are pulp</i> ‒ <i>totally unrecognizable.</i>

01:11:17.942 --> 01:11:20.903
<i>And yes, skin has been removed
from one of the bodies.</i>

01:11:21.028 --> 01:11:23.614
How long have the bodies been there?

01:11:23.697 --> 01:11:25.699
As and when the corpses are removed...

01:11:25.783 --> 01:11:28.869
we will endeavor to ascertain
the mode of death...

01:11:28.953 --> 01:11:32.289
and duration of burial,
as well as identification ‒

01:11:32.373 --> 01:11:35.459
- Is this a serial killer?
- which will, of course, be passed on to you...

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:38.462
after informing, where possible, the next of kin.

01:12:26.427 --> 01:12:29.096
- Are you okay?
- Yes, of course.

01:12:29.805 --> 01:12:31.390
Why wouldn't I be?

01:12:34.893 --> 01:12:37.187
Don't know. I just thought maybe I was ‒

01:12:37.271 --> 01:12:39.273
We were just sorting things out.

01:12:41.984 --> 01:12:44.653
- Well, you better read all about it.
- We already know all about it.

01:12:44.737 --> 01:12:47.031
- It was on the television.
- Of course.

01:12:47.114 --> 01:12:49.908
But I think you'll find the print medium
provides a more lucid and detailed ‒

01:12:49.992 --> 01:12:51.827
Oh, shut up, Alex.

01:12:51.910 --> 01:12:56.165
It wasn't deep enough. I told you it wasn't
deep enough, and you wouldn't listen.

01:12:56.248 --> 01:12:58.167
It doesn't necessarily matter.

01:12:58.250 --> 01:13:00.335
They don't even know who these people are,
and even if they did...

01:13:00.419 --> 01:13:02.671
they've got nothing to connect us with them ‒
nothing.

01:13:02.755 --> 01:13:04.631
I'm glad you're so certain, Alex.

01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:07.134
Makes us feel a whole lot better.

01:13:07.801 --> 01:13:11.513
- I beg your pardon?
- It makes us feel a whole lot better.

01:13:14.433 --> 01:13:16.477
That's what I thought he said.

01:13:41.335 --> 01:13:43.504
Shh, shh, shh. Stop.

01:13:43.587 --> 01:13:45.631
What are you doing here?

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:48.175
It's about me and David.

01:13:48.842 --> 01:13:50.803
Oh, the perfect couple, I should say.

01:13:50.886 --> 01:13:54.640
- You mustn't take it so badly.
- Don't worry.

01:13:54.723 --> 01:13:57.601
I'd do exactly the same thing,
only I don't think I'm his type.

01:13:57.684 --> 01:13:59.645
Don't you ever stop?

01:13:59.728 --> 01:14:01.688
No.

01:14:27.297 --> 01:14:29.299
Take all the time you like, Doctor.

01:14:31.051 --> 01:14:33.387
No, I've never seen any of them.

01:14:34.555 --> 01:14:36.557
Look again if you like.

01:14:43.397 --> 01:14:45.357
I'm sorry. I haven't seen them.

01:14:45.899 --> 01:14:48.068
Do you think you've got
a good memory for faces?

01:14:48.152 --> 01:14:49.736
Same as everyone else.

01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:52.489
But in your work, you must meet
lots of different people every day.

01:14:52.573 --> 01:14:55.826
- New people, new faces, no?
- Yes.

01:14:56.743 --> 01:14:59.204
What do you recognize most, names or faces?

01:14:59.288 --> 01:15:01.832
Diseases.

01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:05.919
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.

01:15:06.753 --> 01:15:08.839
I suppose so.

01:15:08.922 --> 01:15:11.008
I meant that's what it's like.

01:15:12.092 --> 01:15:14.511
- Sorry?
- You said you supposed so...

01:15:14.595 --> 01:15:16.513
but I wasn't offering it for debate.

01:15:16.597 --> 01:15:18.515
He wasn't offering it for debate.

01:15:18.599 --> 01:15:21.185
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.

01:15:48.212 --> 01:15:51.131
No, I've never seen any of these men before.

01:15:52.132 --> 01:15:54.134
Take a look at the first two.

01:15:57.638 --> 01:15:59.473
No, I don't know them.

01:16:00.015 --> 01:16:02.893
If I told you that their car
was parked outside just now...

01:16:02.976 --> 01:16:04.478
would that surprise you?

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:12.236
Yes, I suppose so.

01:16:16.907 --> 01:16:18.784
Well, is it?

01:16:19.284 --> 01:16:20.994
- What?
- Parked there.

01:16:22.621 --> 01:16:24.915
No. Not anymore.

01:16:24.998 --> 01:16:27.501
I just wondered if it would surprise you.

01:16:31.338 --> 01:16:33.257
- That's it.
- That's all?

01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:36.593
Yes. Sorry to waste your time.

01:16:36.677 --> 01:16:38.679
Oh, not at all. Don't worry.

01:16:41.682 --> 01:16:43.183
- One thing.
- Yes?

01:16:43.267 --> 01:16:44.351
- That watch.
- What?

01:16:44.434 --> 01:16:45.519
- The watch.
- Is it real?

01:16:45.602 --> 01:16:47.271
Or a fake?

01:16:47.354 --> 01:16:49.856
Oh. Uh, no, it's a fake.
I picked it up in Thailand.

01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:51.817
The second hand doesn't sweep, you see.

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:54.486
- I see.
- Right.

01:16:55.529 --> 01:16:57.447
Tell you what.

01:16:57.531 --> 01:16:59.950
If you do remember these guys...

01:17:00.033 --> 01:17:02.828
maybe you could give me a phone
on this number.

01:17:04.246 --> 01:17:05.872
Anytime you like.

01:17:13.964 --> 01:17:15.924
I didn't tell them anything. Nothing at all.

01:17:16.008 --> 01:17:18.135
Absolutely nothing.
They're plods. That's all they are.

01:17:18.218 --> 01:17:20.137
Look, if they had anything ‒
anything at all ‒

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:22.055
any witnesses, any forensic evidence ‒

01:17:22.139 --> 01:17:24.266
- they would have whipped it out there and then.
- They know.

01:17:24.349 --> 01:17:27.394
They can know all they like.
It won't do them the slightest bit of good.

01:17:27.477 --> 01:17:30.772
- They <i>know.</i>
- So they know. So what? They have nothing.

01:17:30.856 --> 01:17:33.442
Th-There is nothing to connect us
with that body stuff.

01:17:33.525 --> 01:17:36.903
- Except the money.
- He's right, Alex! They know.

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:20.942
Come on, come on.

01:20:23.236 --> 01:20:25.113
<i>My office is closed.</i>

01:20:25.197 --> 01:20:28.241
<i>- Life, however, grinds on towards its conclusion.</i>
- Fuck.

01:20:28.325 --> 01:20:30.160
<i>In the meantime,
you may wish to leave a message...</i>

01:20:30.243 --> 01:20:33.330
<i>but the final decision is yours alone.</i>

01:20:38.418 --> 01:20:42.005
David? You forgot to wake me.

01:20:54.434 --> 01:20:57.521
- So let's go.
- You and me?

01:20:59.272 --> 01:21:00.941
Together.

01:21:03.818 --> 01:21:05.695
Hey, Alex!

01:21:05.779 --> 01:21:08.323
Who are you calling at this time of night?

01:21:13.954 --> 01:21:16.373
Come out here and talk to us.

01:21:32.806 --> 01:21:34.975
Well?

01:21:35.058 --> 01:21:36.977
Sex lines, is that it?

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:40.438
Triple-X-rated interactive fantasies?
Old habits die hard.

01:21:40.522 --> 01:21:44.067
- I was phoning your mother.
- You old devil.

01:21:44.776 --> 01:21:46.736
Well, anyway...

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:48.530
as you can see, we're leaving.

01:21:48.613 --> 01:21:49.656
So I gathered.

01:21:49.739 --> 01:21:51.992
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.

01:21:52.075 --> 01:21:55.620
- Don't worry about it. I'll forward your mail.
- No, really.

01:21:55.704 --> 01:21:58.999
I am sorry ‒
sorry to be ducking out on you like this.

01:21:59.082 --> 01:22:01.126
- I mean, I hope you won't take it personally.
- No, no, no.

01:22:01.209 --> 01:22:03.169
Don't let it worry you. Not at all.

01:22:03.253 --> 01:22:07.382
- It's probably for the best.
- For the best! Exactly.

01:22:07.465 --> 01:22:09.467
Hey, I wouldn't want things
to end on a downer.

01:22:09.551 --> 01:22:12.804
- Not at all.
- I mean, we've ups and downs, right?

01:22:12.887 --> 01:22:15.432
- Good times, bad times.
- Yeah.

01:22:15.515 --> 01:22:18.518
Ah. We could talk all night,
but we have to go.

01:22:18.602 --> 01:22:20.353
- Don't we, Juliet?
- Yes.

01:22:21.771 --> 01:22:25.025
- And you need your sleep.
- Yes.

01:22:29.613 --> 01:22:32.616
No. Can't think
of anything else that matters.

01:22:32.699 --> 01:22:36.161
- About your mail ‒
- Ah. It's very good of you to offer, but ‒

01:22:36.244 --> 01:22:39.998
- Where do you think you'll go?
- Where will we go?

01:22:41.207 --> 01:22:45.128
Where will we go? Juliet?

01:22:45.712 --> 01:22:48.381
- I don't know.
- Don't be so coy, dear.

01:22:48.465 --> 01:22:50.383
You're going to Rio.

01:22:51.051 --> 01:22:54.137
- What?
- That's right.

01:22:54.220 --> 01:22:56.222
Rio de Janeiro, on your own.

01:22:56.306 --> 01:22:59.726
You should know.
You bought the fucking ticket!

01:23:05.732 --> 01:23:07.400
Did you see that?

01:23:09.235 --> 01:23:12.489
Did she show you that? I'll bet she didn't
show you that before she sent you up there.

01:23:12.572 --> 01:23:16.576
What did she say?
"We'll split it together, you and me, 50-50"?

01:23:19.913 --> 01:23:22.457
But I'll bet you didn't say
you'd split on him.

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:25.669
- It wasn't like that.
- Don't lie to me! Don't treat me like that!

01:23:25.752 --> 01:23:26.920
I bought it.

01:23:29.673 --> 01:23:31.007
What?

01:23:32.592 --> 01:23:35.595
I bought the tickets.
One for her and one for me. It was my idea.

01:23:35.679 --> 01:23:38.139
Your idea? I see.

01:23:38.223 --> 01:23:40.141
Well, that fits.

01:23:40.225 --> 01:23:42.477
I mean, you and him fit together.

01:23:43.561 --> 01:23:46.523
- I should have seen that a long time ago.
- Alex, stop him!

01:23:46.606 --> 01:23:48.525
No. Let him go. Let him have it all.

01:23:48.608 --> 01:23:50.610
