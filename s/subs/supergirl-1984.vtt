What's that gonna be, Zaltar?

03:50.301 --> 03:53.272
I think, a tree.

03:54.305 --> 03:57.409
A tree. What is a tree?

03:57.508 --> 03:59.945
A lovely thing
which grows on Earth.

04:00.044 --> 04:02.314
Earth?
You mean, where my cousin went?

04:02.413 --> 04:04.783
Hm, and to where,
one day soon perhaps

04:04.877 --> 04:07.352
I might venture as well.

04:07.451 --> 04:09.721
I don't believe you. How?

04:09.820 --> 04:13.892
- In that. Through there.
- The binary chute?

04:13.990 --> 04:15.694
But you could never survive
the pressure. It'd destroy--

04:15.792 --> 04:18.330
In that I can.
Zip-zap and I'm gone.

04:18.429 --> 04:20.099
But you'd never leave us,
Zaltar.

04:20.197 --> 04:23.302
- 'You'd never leave Argo City.'
- Indeed, I might, Kara.

04:23.401 --> 04:25.337
Too much of a good thing here.

04:25.436 --> 04:28.173
'Perhaps,
I'll try Saturn instead.'

04:28.272 --> 04:29.774
Yes, I think I might.

04:29.873 --> 04:33.178
Saturn is..
Is that further away than Earth?

04:33.277 --> 04:34.213
Silly question.

04:34.312 --> 04:35.314
Did you not study

04:35.412 --> 04:36.715

at school?

04:36.814 --> 04:38.550
Do they not teach you
anything anymore?

04:38.648 --> 04:40.552
Well, of course they do, I..

04:40.650 --> 04:43.722
I know the equations. Well..

04:46.156 --> 04:47.927
I just can't see 'em
in my head.

04:48.025 --> 04:52.364
Most great artists find
mathematics troublesome, Kara.

04:52.462 --> 04:55.434
- Only use your imagination.
- Mm-hmm.

04:55.532 --> 04:57.970
Saturn and Earth
are in outer space

04:58.069 --> 05:01.506
but we, we are in inner space.

05:01.605 --> 05:04.376
Our city
has two great power sources.

05:04.474 --> 05:06.411
This is one of them. Look.

05:06.511 --> 05:09.614
[pulsating]

05:12.283 --> 05:14.719
An Omegahedron.

05:14.819 --> 05:16.388
The Guardians let you have it?

05:16.488 --> 05:18.257
Not exactly.

05:18.355 --> 05:21.526
- I borrowed it.
- You stole it.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.295
- Oh, Zaltar, they're gonna--
- No.

05:23.394 --> 05:26.631
Borrowed it for the afternoon.

05:28.399 --> 05:32.137
- For inspiration.
- Inspiration.

never see the branches

05:56.695 --> 05:58.063

05:58.162 --> 06:01.633
Why? An Omegahedron
can create life, can't it?

06:01.733 --> 06:03.635
It can't, child, it can't.

06:03.735 --> 06:05.870
Just the illusion of life.

06:05.969 --> 06:07.973
That's a fancy shadow
of the real thing

06:08.071 --> 06:11.143
which is the most we can hope
for on this lonely old rock.

06:11.241 --> 06:13.545

'Kara?'

06:13.644 --> 06:15.614
Kara, I've been looking for you
for ages.

06:15.713 --> 06:16.815
Well, I'm sorry, mother.

06:16.915 --> 06:19.284
- Zaltar.
- Alura, join us.

06:19.383 --> 06:22.154
We're just inventing miracles.

06:28.159 --> 06:30.062
Good. Now try it.

06:31.195 --> 06:32.392
Let your imagination explode

06:32.496 --> 06:34.394
and give it a try. Go on.

06:34.498 --> 06:37.136
Zaltar, m-my husband tells me

06:37.235 --> 06:41.206
you talk of leaving Argo City.
For where?

06:41.305 --> 06:43.775
Parts unknown.
It is, alas, a fact.

06:43.873 --> 06:45.177
(Zaltar)
'You and Zor-El
have a life here.'

06:45.276 --> 06:47.012
'You have each other
and you have Kara.'

'But, Zaltar, you founded'

06:49.513 --> 06:50.950
'this city. It's yours.'

06:51.048 --> 06:54.786
As far as the eye can see,
right to the veil, smack.

06:54.886 --> 06:57.056
And then what? What is beyond?

06:57.154 --> 07:00.259
'Alura, I cannot contain myself
to Argo City only.'

07:00.357 --> 07:02.127
'My head is boiling with ideas.'

07:02.226 --> 07:05.497
'My imagination is too vast,
it's uncontrollable.'

07:05.596 --> 07:06.831
If you want my opinion, Zaltar

07:06.931 --> 07:08.733
you're starting
to repeat yourself here

07:08.832 --> 07:12.271
with all this airy,
glittery stuff.

07:12.364 --> 07:15.740
Exactly.
That's why I'm going to Venus.

07:17.307 --> 07:19.411
Venus? When?

07:19.509 --> 07:22.747

at the latest.

- Shh, Kara.

this city can't survive

so thin.

09:03.748 --> 09:05.717
I know. So I shall find it.

09:05.816 --> 09:07.452
I shall go
right to the end of inner space

09:07.552 --> 09:08.548
and I shall return it.

This is our universe and
you've destroyed it with a game.

10:18.189 --> 10:21.126
She will be safe,
through the binary

20:15.685 --> 20:17.522
"The Witch's Guide
To Heaven And Hell"

20:17.621 --> 20:19.891
and if you start your own coven,
all you have to do

20:19.990 --> 20:22.861
is charge five bucks a head

- Ah!

20:24.062 --> 20:25.264
That's better than goose egg.

What's
in the Coffer of Shadow there?

20:27.197 --> 20:29.834
- Where's little Nigel?
- Nigel, my dear Bianca..

20:29.934 --> 20:31.870
- Is history.
- Oh, yeah? How so?

20:31.968 --> 20:35.640
The water department is history,
the car payments are history.

20:35.739 --> 20:37.376
The mortgage payments
are history.

20:37.475 --> 20:40.145
- How are the property taxes?

22:54.678 --> 22:57.616
- Well, hello to you, honeybun.
- Hello.

22:57.715 --> 23:00.185
I was wondering
if you could tell me where I am.

23:00.284 --> 23:03.588
What do they call this place,
Eddie? Lovers' Lane, isn't it?

23:03.687 --> 23:07.426
You got it in one, Billy boy.
Lovers' Lane.

23:07.524 --> 23:09.861
Oh, no, you see,
what I meant was, is..

23:09.960 --> 23:12.331
Well, those lights over there,
what are they called?

Check out the view

You're, uh,
Superman's best friend, huh?

23:23.041 --> 23:25.405
No. His cousin.

23:25.509 --> 23:27.812
I've come here
to search for the Omegahedron.

23:27.912 --> 23:30.315
It's a power source

Where is it?
Where's the little mystery ball?

25:20.757 --> 25:23.062
Just let me have a peek.
Maybe I can shed some light.

25:23.160 --> 25:25.364
- I hate light.
- I mean, is it electrical?

25:25.463 --> 25:26.631
Is it hot to the touch?

25:26.730 --> 25:29.334
- Where is it?
- Safe and sound.

25:29.433 --> 25:31.870
Go mix. Leave me to my thoughts.

"Go mix?" With these people?
You must be mad.

Who are they?
Wrinkly little wretches.

These are my foot soldiers,
Nigel.

My army of the night.

25:42.647 --> 25:44.449
I'm considering nothing less

25:44.548 --> 25:47.419
than world domination.

25:47.517 --> 25:48.853
After you left me in the lurch,

25:48.952 --> 25:51.123
I saw something
that should worry you greatly

25:51.222 --> 25:54.326
if you're serious
about taking over this planet.

25:54.425 --> 25:56.795
My secret was blue and red

25:56.894 --> 25:59.264
and it knew how to fly.

25:59.363 --> 26:01.433
I have a secret, too, Nigel.

26:01.533 --> 26:04.736
I have the power.

26:04.835 --> 26:06.671
Now, get that through your head.

33:25.777 --> 33:29.348
- Hi.
- Oh. Hi.

33:29.447 --> 33:32.918
- I'm Lucy Lane.
- Lucy Lee, this is Linda Lane.

33:33.017 --> 33:34.353
- No, it isn't.
- 'What?'

33:34.452 --> 33:37.322
- She's Linda Lee and I'm--
- Lucy Lane.

33:37.421 --> 33:39.091
You two know each other?

33:39.189 --> 33:41.021
Oh, no. We just met.

33:41.125 --> 33:42.827
- When?
- Just now.

33:42.926 --> 33:45.430
But we've known each other
for years. Haven't we, Linda?

33:45.529 --> 33:46.531
Oh, well, gee, I don't think--

33:46.630 --> 33:49.168
Oh, of course.
"The Daily Planet."

33:49.266 --> 33:51.436
Of course,
Linda's cousin works there.

33:51.535 --> 33:53.705
A-and your sister,
what's her name

33:53.804 --> 33:56.375
the one that's always calling me
and bothering me?

33:56.474 --> 33:58.843
- Lois.
- Ah, yes. That's the one.

33:58.942 --> 34:02.747
Anyway, uh, show our new Ms. Lee
around, Ms. Lane.

34:04.581 --> 34:06.485
Oh, by the way,
she's an orphan.

34:06.583 --> 34:09.388
But don't let her play
on your sympathies, hm?

34:25.770 --> 34:27.539
So who's your cousin?

34:27.639 --> 34:28.807
Clark Kent.

34:30.274 --> 34:31.911
You're kidding me.

34:32.008 --> 34:34.446
Clark Kent's your cousin?
You're putting me on.

34:34.545 --> 34:37.116
- Do you know him?
- Do I know him?

34:37.214 --> 34:38.517
Does my sister know him?

34:38.615 --> 34:42.187
- Now, that's the big question.
- Oh, I see.

34:42.286 --> 34:44.056
I guess if they work
at the same newspaper

34:44.154 --> 34:45.490
they must know each other.

34:45.589 --> 34:48.427
- Well..
- Is this where I'll sleep?

34:48.525 --> 34:51.230
Well, this is your bed,
but we don't sleep around here.

34:51.329 --> 34:53.765
Non-stop excitement
in this dorm.

34:55.565 --> 34:57.836
All the real dementals
are sent here.

34:57.935 --> 34:59.138
[chuckles]

34:59.237 --> 35:02.574
So when's the rest of your stuff
arriving?

35:02.673 --> 35:04.576
I don't have any other stuff.

35:04.675 --> 35:06.778
What,
it's all in that little bag?

35:08.778 --> 35:11.583
Oh, well, you see,
I have the means to buy more.

35:11.682 --> 35:14.719
It's just.. Well, I just
haven't had the chance since..

35:14.819 --> 35:17.722
[instrumental music]

35:31.002 --> 35:32.171
Do you know him?

35:32.270 --> 35:35.240
Superman? Sure.

35:35.339 --> 35:37.542
'My sister's got something going
with the big guy.'

35:37.641 --> 35:39.478
Hey, listen,
you can borrow any of my clothes

35:39.576 --> 35:42.982
anytime you want.
Just dig in and help yourself.

35:43.080 --> 35:45.517
Thank you. You're very kind.

35:47.385 --> 35:49.754
He's a real character.

35:49.854 --> 35:52.091
A real hunk.

35:52.190 --> 35:53.392
'I'll introduce you to him
someday'

'if we wind up getting along.'

35:55.860 --> 35:58.763
[instrumental music]

36:00.531 --> 36:03.068
Now, then, focus your tiny minds

36:03.166 --> 36:06.906
on the kind of problems that
used to take w-weeks of thought

36:07.004 --> 36:08.573
before the computer.

36:08.673 --> 36:10.875
Even now it can take a long time

36:10.975 --> 36:13.145
without certain algorithms

36:13.244 --> 36:16.982
which,
if you behave for two seconds

36:17.081 --> 36:19.084
I might reveal to you.

Love. Hate. Love. Hate.

36:30.261 --> 36:33.732
Love. The cards have decided.

36:33.831 --> 36:37.802
People will do anything
for love.

36:37.902 --> 36:40.172
They'll jump off cliffs
for love.

36:40.271 --> 36:42.807
They'll drown themselves
like lemmings.

36:42.907 --> 36:44.609
So..

36:44.709 --> 36:48.713
...I'll make everybody love me.

36:48.813 --> 36:50.015
Oh, no chance.

36:50.113 --> 36:52.212
You're an awful person, honey,
remember? Forget it.

36:52.316 --> 36:56.188
Use your imagination, pinhead.
That's what magic is all about.

36:56.287 --> 36:58.457
[engine revving]

36:59.924 --> 37:01.221
Why are we not moving?

37:01.325 --> 37:05.330
[exhales sharply]
Because I'm in love.

37:05.429 --> 37:08.700
'Come here,
you beautiful thing.'

numbers I want you to try..'

(Selena)
It's trying
to tell me something.

37:25.649 --> 37:27.852
Well, what?
That we're near danger?

37:27.947 --> 37:29.854
I don't know. How do I know?

37:35.225 --> 37:38.463
- I know.
- Well, tell me.

37:38.563 --> 37:40.933
My prince has come.

37:41.032 --> 37:43.302
(Bianca)
'Oh, no.'

37:43.400 --> 37:45.470
I saw him first, Selena.
That's not fair.

37:45.569 --> 37:46.972
I copied his number first.

37:47.071 --> 37:49.741
Well done.
Now, let's get out of here.

- Yes, sir, I am.
- Oh, are you?

W-well, here, sir.
On Earth, sir.

for the rest of us.

you were staring at the wall

38:25.476 --> 38:29.548
and not at your terminal, like
your other little friends here

38:29.647 --> 38:32.051
you were in fact hard at work

38:32.150 --> 38:35.487
solving this little equation?

38:35.586 --> 38:37.923
Oh, yes, sir, I was.
I mean, I was--

38:38.021 --> 38:41.321
Excellent. The answer, please.
Pay attention, class.

38:41.425 --> 38:44.896

is about to enlighten us.

my papers?

39:11.188 --> 39:12.624
Of course not, sir.

39:12.723 --> 39:14.593
Then how do you know
the correct answer?

39:14.691 --> 39:16.962
- 'How?'
- I guess I just--

You know, I gotta learn--

I don't know.

- Yeah.

you want some friendly advice?

she tripped you on purpose?

It just hit her shoulder.

did you see that cute guy

and the big muscles.

- He was something else.
- 'Did you talk to him?'

'No, but I'm gonna.'

40:52.022 --> 40:54.994
'He's working on the trees.
He could be around for a while.'

- Yes.

why don't you shut off the hot

41:15.647 --> 41:17.116
and give them an ice bath?

(Myra)
'Are you kidding?
That's nowheresville.'

41:19.450 --> 41:21.620
If you shut off the cold,
you might scald them.

41:58.822 --> 42:01.626
It looks the same to me.
It's kind of dull.

42:03.293 --> 42:06.365
All you need is a couple of
streaks and your ears pierced.

42:06.464 --> 42:08.633
I can do it for you
free of charge.

42:08.733 --> 42:10.169
- My ears, what?
- Pierced.

42:10.268 --> 42:12.972
Like, you know, I take a needle,
and then I heat it up

42:13.070 --> 42:15.374
and then I dab it
with some alcohol and zap

42:15.472 --> 42:17.537
all the guys go crazy.

42:17.641 --> 42:19.811
Because I have holes
in my ears?

42:19.910 --> 42:21.880
What, are you putting me on?

42:21.979 --> 42:24.249
Sometimes I can't
figure you out, Linda.

42:27.584 --> 42:28.988
So where are you going
this weekend?

42:29.087 --> 42:31.456
- 'Nowhere.'
- Nowhere?

42:31.550 --> 42:32.524
Well,
you can't stay around here.

42:32.623 --> 42:34.226
This place is depressing.

42:34.325 --> 42:36.061
'I mean, like the tombs.'

42:36.160 --> 42:37.862
- Why?
- 'Why?'

42:37.962 --> 42:39.932
What, were you born yesterday?

42:40.030 --> 42:42.401
This is a three-day weekend.

42:42.499 --> 42:44.636
A three-day weekend.

42:44.735 --> 42:47.772
So, listen,
why don't you come home with me?

42:47.871 --> 42:49.241
'I only live
about five miles from here'

42:49.339 --> 42:52.511
and I got this guy
coming up from Metropolis.

42:52.610 --> 42:54.679
I think he knows
your cousin Clark.

42:54.779 --> 42:56.982
'His name's Jimmy Olsen.'

42:57.081 --> 42:59.184
'I think he's real stuck on me.'

43:00.812 --> 43:03.822
Anyways, I could ask him
to bring a friend along.

43:03.920 --> 43:07.226
- 'What are you doing?'
- Oh, nothing. Heh.

43:07.324 --> 43:09.028
'Nothing.'

43:09.126 --> 43:11.630
No, I think I'm gonna
stay here and study.

43:11.729 --> 43:13.698
Get things organized.

43:15.066 --> 43:17.369
Don't forget
to call me Saturday.

43:17.469 --> 43:18.904
Just a sec.

43:20.404 --> 43:23.642
Hey, Linda, I'll see you later
at Popeye's then, okay?

43:23.741 --> 43:25.477
Alright, I'll try. I promise.

43:25.576 --> 43:26.912
You better.
It's gonna be fun.

43:27.011 --> 43:28.147

45:34.438 --> 45:36.608
whichever comes first."

45:36.708 --> 45:38.710
Big deal. One day.

45:38.809 --> 45:40.812
Why don't you just use,
you know..

45:40.911 --> 45:42.714
I'm saving it
for bigger things.

45:42.813 --> 45:45.517
(Sam on radio)
'Hiya, folks.
You're listening to big Sam'

45:45.616 --> 45:48.653
'the country-and-western voice
of the Chicago area.'

45:48.752 --> 45:53.058
'Now to start off the hour,
something mellow and sweet..'

46:06.370 --> 46:07.472
[doorbell buzzing]

46:07.572 --> 46:10.009
Bianca, get the door!

46:12.310 --> 46:14.079
Bianca!

46:19.416 --> 46:22.021
You rang? Hey, you!

46:24.621 --> 46:27.759
I said, you rang?

46:27.859 --> 46:29.962
Oh, yeah. How you doin'?

46:31.595 --> 46:36.135
Uh.. I'm lookin' for some person
called Mrs. Selena.

46:36.234 --> 46:40.605
-<i> Madame</i> Selena.
- Ah.

46:40.705 --> 46:44.343
And you found her, lucky boy.

46:44.442 --> 46:45.377
<i>Entrer.</i>

46:49.446 --> 46:51.683
You must be very popular
in the neighborhood.

46:51.782 --> 46:54.186
I always see your truck
parked around.

46:54.285 --> 46:56.816
Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah, I get
a lot of repeat business.

46:56.921 --> 46:58.958
Uh, people like my work.

46:59.057 --> 47:02.494
Yes, I'm sure they do.

47:06.030 --> 47:07.732
- Wet your whistle?
- Huh?

47:07.831 --> 47:11.136
Oh, yeah, yeah. As a matter
of fact, uh, don't mind if I do.

47:40.030 --> 47:43.635
So, uh,
where's the lawn...at?

47:43.734 --> 47:46.605
- It dropped dead.
- Where at exactly? Out back?

47:46.703 --> 47:48.407
You know, I thought
we might get to know each other

47:48.505 --> 47:50.609
a little more before we, uh,
dig in

47:50.709 --> 47:54.346
and talk real turkey.

47:54.439 --> 47:55.814
[clears throat]

47:55.912 --> 47:58.878
Well, um, see, I'm kind
of a private person, you know?

47:58.983 --> 48:01.987
I mean,
I do my work, I go home.

48:02.086 --> 48:03.322
- To your wife?
- No.

48:03.421 --> 48:04.924
At the present moment in time

48:05.022 --> 48:06.625
I'm currently enjoying
a single status

48:06.724 --> 48:07.759
in my personal life.

48:07.859 --> 48:11.496
- Cheers.
- Bottoms up, huh?

48:11.596 --> 48:13.032
Bottoms up.

48:17.168 --> 48:18.703
[clears throat]
I, uh, I noticed you got

48:18.802 --> 48:21.740
a pretty alkaline-lookin'
soil out there.

48:21.839 --> 48:24.043
What I want are some

48:24.141 --> 48:27.908
house plants inside here.

48:28.012 --> 48:30.983
Something that goes well
with the house.

48:31.082 --> 48:33.785
This is a house?

48:33.885 --> 48:35.854
Of course it's a house.

48:35.953 --> 48:38.023
There's the bedroom
over there.

48:38.122 --> 48:40.225
[breathing heavily]

48:41.859 --> 48:44.129
I think it's
getting dark in here.

48:46.030 --> 48:48.767
You know,
what kind of plants

48:48.866 --> 48:52.137
are gonna wanna
grow in this dump?

48:53.738 --> 48:55.640
I don't know.

48:55.740 --> 48:58.077
Shade plants?

48:58.175 --> 49:00.112
- To us.
- Hm?

49:00.211 --> 49:03.415
And to the seeds
we'll plant together.

49:03.513 --> 49:07.486
Yeah, I'll, uh,
I'll d-drink to that.

49:11.389 --> 49:14.359
Mm. You probably killed him,
you know?

49:18.395 --> 49:21.033
Sleep well.

49:21.131 --> 49:24.103
And when you wake,
drown in my eyes

49:24.202 --> 49:27.106
and be all mine.

49:27.205 --> 49:29.108
[doorbell buzzing]

49:29.206 --> 49:32.144
If that's the goddamn
Jehovah's witnesses again..

49:32.242 --> 49:34.346
[sighs]
I'll get it.

49:37.148 --> 49:39.251
[doorbell buzzing]

49:41.119 --> 49:44.523
Oh, hello, Nigel. It's you.

49:44.622 --> 49:46.758
Nice suit.

49:46.852 --> 49:49.761
- Subtle.
- I want to see Selena.

49:49.861 --> 49:51.863
She's indisposed at the moment.

49:51.962 --> 49:55.367
(Selena)
'Whoever it is,
we don't want any.'

49:55.466 --> 49:57.998
It's Nigel,
and he's not going away

49:58.102 --> 50:00.205
until he talks to you.

50:02.040 --> 50:03.575
What the devil do you want?

50:03.674 --> 50:06.178
I want to make
a very serious proposal.

50:06.277 --> 50:07.712
In that outfit?

50:08.879 --> 50:09.814
This is a leisure suit.

50:09.914 --> 50:11.011
I've got three days off

50:11.115 --> 50:12.517
from those little beasts
at Midvale

50:12.616 --> 50:14.786
and I intend
to let my hair down.

50:14.886 --> 50:16.788
[intense music]

50:21.493 --> 50:23.262
Oh. Oh.

50:46.017 --> 50:48.287
[screaming]

50:52.190 --> 50:54.093
[laughing]

50:54.192 --> 50:56.295
[music continues]

51:05.869 --> 51:08.840
That ball will not operate
at its fullest

51:08.939 --> 51:12.611
until you internalize
your powers, Selena.

51:12.705 --> 51:15.247
Some mosaic invocations.

51:15.345 --> 51:17.016
- Some what?
- Come again?

51:17.115 --> 51:19.251
(Nigel)
Exactly. That's my point.

51:19.350 --> 51:22.287
You girls are rank amateurs
playing with fire.

51:22.386 --> 51:25.790
Because we own the matches.

51:25.889 --> 51:29.628
I, of all people,
know a hustle when I hear one.

51:29.728 --> 51:30.662
Goodbye, Nigel.

51:30.761 --> 51:31.896
It was nice talking
to you, Nigel.

51:31.996 --> 51:33.332
No, it wasn't.

51:33.430 --> 51:35.300
I hate to seem pushy

51:35.399 --> 51:36.969
'my fairest of the fair,
but--'

51:37.068 --> 51:38.570
A word of advice, Nigel.

51:38.669 --> 51:41.873
If I had your skin problems,
I'd stop bothering people

51:41.972 --> 51:45.177
put a bag over my head,
and go live under a bridge.

51:45.276 --> 51:48.147
- 'Ouch!'
- Ha-ha-ha.

51:48.245 --> 51:50.349
There's nothing wrong
with my skin.

51:52.617 --> 51:54.386
That bitch.

51:56.821 --> 51:58.723
You know, some people.

52:00.791 --> 52:02.694
Where is he?

52:02.794 --> 52:04.396
Where is he?

52:04.495 --> 52:06.966
[instrumental music]

52:07.064 --> 52:09.168
[groans]

52:13.871 --> 52:16.441
Where is he?

52:16.540 --> 52:18.810
Whoever he sees first,
he'll love with all his heart.

52:18.910 --> 52:21.080
What, for a day, tops, right?

52:21.179 --> 52:22.614
He was too young
for you anyway, you know?

52:22.713 --> 52:26.351
No, I do not know.
Where is he?

52:31.555 --> 52:34.659
(Bianca)
'Hey, I know that guy.'

52:40.630 --> 52:44.736
- Oh, the cable's out.
- What cable?

52:44.836 --> 52:46.738
This is a mirror.

52:47.871 --> 52:51.343
So how come we could
ever see him in it?

52:51.441 --> 52:56.176
That was magic, damn it.
The power.

52:56.280 --> 52:58.883
Oh. So make it happen again,
you know?

52:58.978 --> 53:01.220
I can't make it happen again.

53:01.313 --> 53:02.787
I don't know how I did it
the first time.

53:02.886 --> 53:07.326
Oh. Maybe you should let that
thing out of its box, you know?

53:07.425 --> 53:09.894
Maybe it's more powerful
if you let it out of its box.

53:09.994 --> 53:11.163
- The box.
- The box.

53:11.262 --> 53:13.132
- Where is it?
- The box?

53:13.231 --> 53:14.866
It's underneath the rug
where you left it.

53:14.966 --> 53:15.935
Go ahead.

53:21.005 --> 53:21.941
[grunts]

53:23.875 --> 53:24.944
It's stuck.

53:26.678 --> 53:27.612
[grunts]

53:29.046 --> 53:31.516
This is not my day.

53:31.615 --> 53:35.287
It's stuck?
How could it be stuck?

53:35.380 --> 53:38.590
- It's growing.
- 'How could it be growing?'

53:38.689 --> 53:40.892
(Bianca)
'It's made out of lead.'

How come there's no sound?

[car horns blaring]
Get off the road, turkey!

54:06.583 --> 54:08.687
'You wanna kill yourself?'

54:18.194 --> 54:20.565
(female #13)
'Anyway, she saw a lawyer,
and now she's gonna file.'

54:20.664 --> 54:23.868
I told her to take him
for every cent, clean him out.

54:23.967 --> 54:25.804
- Thank you very much.
- 'You're welcome.'

54:25.904 --> 54:28.707
(female #14)
'BLT-10, hold the mayo.'

54:31.141 --> 54:33.778
Here you go, everybody.

54:33.877 --> 54:35.414
- 'Who wants onion rings?'
- 'Yeah, here.'

54:35.512 --> 54:36.781
- Thanks.
- 'Some French fries.'

54:36.880 --> 54:38.117
(male #3)
'The French fries are mine.'

54:38.215 --> 54:40.019
Chicken for myself.

54:40.118 --> 54:41.486
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

54:41.585 --> 54:44.056
- 'Side order tomatoes.'
- Thanks for inviting me, Lucy.

54:44.154 --> 54:45.490
I'm glad you could come, Jimmy.

54:45.589 --> 54:47.692
- 'You want a root beer?'
- 'Yeah, thanks.'

54:49.293 --> 54:50.729
Oh, there's Linda.

54:53.565 --> 54:55.434
Hey, Linda!

54:55.533 --> 54:57.436
- 'Hi!'
- Well, hello.

54:57.534 --> 54:59.538
That's Clark Kent's cousin?

54:59.637 --> 55:01.907
- 'Who's Clark Kent?'
- 'Is that Linda?'

55:02.006 --> 55:03.909
[indistinct chatter]

55:04.876 --> 55:06.278
- Guess what.
- What?

55:06.377 --> 55:07.307
There's this all-night party

55:07.411 --> 55:08.347
tonight at Eddie's.

55:08.446 --> 55:10.182
He's the guy with the tattoo.

55:10.281 --> 55:11.750
His folks are out of town.

55:11.848 --> 55:15.287
And the guy with the bow tie?
That's Jimmy.

55:15.386 --> 55:16.721
So you wanna come?

55:16.820 --> 55:19.191
Oh, I don't know. I'm not
signed out for an overnight.

55:19.289 --> 55:21.927
Well, so what? Go back, sign in
and climb out the window.

55:22.026 --> 55:24.663
Mrs. Murphy's drunk
as a skunk by now.

55:24.762 --> 55:26.031
Totally on another planet.

55:26.130 --> 55:28.600
Oh, I don't know.
It just doesn't seem right.

55:28.700 --> 55:30.502
But that's why it'll be fun.

55:30.601 --> 55:32.104
- Okay?
- Okay.

55:32.203 --> 55:33.906
[tires screeching]

55:34.005 --> 55:37.542
- Get off the road, buddy!
- Hey, stupid!

55:37.642 --> 55:39.611
Look at that dingleberry.

55:39.711 --> 55:41.313
What's a dingleberry?

55:41.412 --> 55:44.883
(Lucy)
Hey, you, space cadet!
Get outta the street!

55:46.650 --> 55:49.955
- What is wrong with him?
- I don't know.

55:50.054 --> 55:51.156
He's probably on drugs.

55:51.255 --> 55:53.758
And he's gonna get creamed
if he's not too careful.

55:53.857 --> 55:57.029
- Hi. Jimmy Olsen, photographer.
- Oh, I-I'm Kara.

55:57.128 --> 55:58.297
- 'Who?'
- Who?

55:58.395 --> 56:01.500
Oh, I'm...c-concerned.

56:01.598 --> 56:03.268
Well,
that if we don't do something.

56:03.367 --> 56:05.737
Oh, yeah, you go out there,
and try to help a guy like that

56:05.836 --> 56:07.572
'and he's probably got
a gun or a knife.'

56:07.672 --> 56:10.075
You know, it's not too safe.

56:10.174 --> 56:12.144
Hey, I'm starving. Let's eat.

01:16:19.584 --> 01:16:20.752
Please?

01:16:20.851 --> 01:16:22.821
Well, alright.
But just for a minute.

01:16:36.567 --> 01:16:38.904
You hate me, don't you?

01:16:39.003 --> 01:16:41.640
Hate you?
I don't even know you.

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.675
I don't even know your name.

01:16:43.775 --> 01:16:45.477
Ethan.

01:16:45.576 --> 01:16:49.581
Say my name aloud but once,
and I shall die the happy fool.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.816
- Look, Ethan--
- Huh!

01:16:54.285 --> 01:16:55.687

01:16:57.589 --> 01:16:58.857
Ethan.

01:17:00.357 --> 01:17:02.427
Her soft caress
did at once renew

01:17:02.526 --> 01:17:05.264
the beating
of his broken heart.

01:17:05.362 --> 01:17:07.332
Are you crazy?

Marry you, but..

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:26.618
- I don't--
- Don't say it. Don't, please.

01:17:26.718 --> 01:17:28.220
I know.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.354
What?

01:17:30.454 --> 01:17:32.124
We're from different worlds.

01:17:32.221 --> 01:17:35.760
- You mean, you know where I'm--
- Just give me a chance, Linda.

01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:38.697
Love makes everything possible.

01:17:38.796 --> 01:17:40.132
A poor, uneducated gardener

01:17:40.231 --> 01:17:42.334
can indeed worship
a rich debutante

01:17:42.433 --> 01:17:44.469
and make her happy,
if she'd just..

01:17:44.569 --> 01:17:46.666
Oh, Ethan.

01:17:46.771 --> 01:17:48.273
I'm not rich. I'm just--

01:17:48.372 --> 01:17:50.976
Well, then
I'll support us both.

01:17:52.504 --> 01:17:54.379
You're nuts, you know that?

01:17:54.478 --> 01:17:58.150
You're so sweet,

That oughta keep her out

Now, don't go through the roof.

you didn't say that.

- Me.
- Ah-ha!

My dear, Nigel,
the way to a woman's heart

01:25:27.731 --> 01:25:30.335
is through the elimination
of her rivals.

01:25:30.434 --> 01:25:32.471
- Murder. Are you proposing--
- Oh.

01:25:32.569 --> 01:25:35.340
Certainly not.
Leave that to me.

- Well, I don't.

- Put that down.

Yes. In the flesh.

So she will follow?
No other reason?

01:26:11.242 --> 01:26:14.213
- None.
- You're sure of that?

What happened?

01:26:34.598 --> 01:26:37.402
You got hit on the head
by a coconut.

- Huh?
- Hm.

What's with
the Halloween costume?

01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:46.511
This is not a costume.
These are my clothes.

- Look, I, I have to go now.

I'll go back there and I'll
take care of everything, so--

01:30:34.673 --> 01:30:37.776
[pulsating]

01:30:41.112 --> 01:30:44.749
Now, let's get out
of this dump.

01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:47.586
(male #1)
Hartley, you've seen this thing?

01:30:47.685 --> 01:30:48.988
Look at this..

01:30:49.086 --> 01:30:51.290
Hey, what's the matter?
You catchin' flies?

01:30:51.389 --> 01:30:52.624
Lucy, look.

01:30:52.724 --> 01:30:54.826
[intense music]

01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:57.629
(Lucy)
Oh!

01:30:57.729 --> 01:30:59.164
What is it?

01:31:00.864 --> 01:31:03.402
(Jimmy)
It's a mountain, Lucy,
isn't it?

01:31:03.501 --> 01:31:04.803
Tell me I'm not seeing things.

01:31:04.901 --> 01:31:06.271
(Lucy)
'How did it get there, Jimmy?'

01:31:06.370 --> 01:31:08.040
(Jimmy)
'I don't know.
It just appeared.'

01:31:08.139 --> 01:31:10.775
(Lucy)
'How can a mountain
just appear?'

01:31:10.875 --> 01:31:13.512
'Hey, there's something
on the top.'

01:31:13.610 --> 01:31:15.414
(Jimmy)
'Looks like a castle.'

01:31:15.507 --> 01:31:17.149
(Lucy)
'Looks more like a fortress.'

01:31:17.248 --> 01:31:20.152
[instrumental music]

01:31:47.278 --> 01:31:50.182
[music continues]

01:32:06.230 --> 01:32:07.299
Ethan?

01:32:14.606 --> 01:32:15.874
Ethan.

01:32:27.819 --> 01:32:30.255
[chain rattling]

01:32:32.522 --> 01:32:35.627
[eerie music]

01:32:47.572 --> 01:32:48.873
Ethan!

01:32:49.608 --> 01:32:50.875
[thuds]

01:33:16.528 --> 01:33:19.304
Enjoy your prison, Supergirl.

01:33:20.571 --> 01:33:24.443
Forever and ever.

01:33:24.543 --> 01:33:26.645
[dramatic music]

01:33:27.812 --> 01:33:29.581
No, Ethan!

01:33:29.681 --> 01:33:32.017
Don't do this!

01:33:32.116 --> 01:33:33.352
'Ethan!'

01:33:34.619 --> 01:33:37.722
[laughing]

01:33:44.356 --> 01:33:47.266
[music continues]

01:34:07.719 --> 01:34:09.821
[glass shattering]

01:34:11.221 --> 01:34:14.126
[wind howling]

01:34:33.172 --> 01:34:34.947
[grunts]

01:34:52.864 --> 01:34:55.968
[groaning]

01:35:03.841 --> 01:35:07.446
[echoing]
Where am I?

01:35:08.679 --> 01:35:10.782
[wind howling]

01:35:34.338 --> 01:35:37.242
[eerie music]

01:35:57.161 --> 01:35:57.930
[grunts]

01:35:58.029 --> 01:36:00.132
[dramatic music]

01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:12.144
[grunting]

01:36:26.457 --> 01:36:28.928
Hey, you can't arrest me
without a warrant.

01:36:30.427 --> 01:36:31.931
'I'm calling my lawyer.'

01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:35.134
[dramatic music]

01:36:40.237 --> 01:36:43.142
- Slow down.
- We want Selena out!

01:36:44.475 --> 01:36:46.845
Smile, lunkhead.
You're not a gardener anymore.

01:36:46.944 --> 01:36:48.413
You're Prince Ethan, now.

01:36:48.512 --> 01:36:50.882
Are we gonna stand up to her
or not?

01:36:50.982 --> 01:36:53.118
- 'Yeah. Yeah.'
- Selena must go!

01:36:53.217 --> 01:36:55.087
Who's this little twerpette?

01:36:55.186 --> 01:36:56.688
She's someone
who believes in freedom.

01:36:56.786 --> 01:36:58.991
Uh, Lucy, it's not a good time
to express yourself.

01:36:59.083 --> 01:37:00.759
(Lucy)
'I don't know who you
think you are'

01:37:00.858 --> 01:37:02.594
or what evil force you represent

01:37:02.693 --> 01:37:04.796
but if you think you can just
get rid of anybody

01:37:04.889 --> 01:37:07.799
who stands up to you,
just make them disappear

01:37:07.899 --> 01:37:09.768
like my friend, Linda..

01:37:09.868 --> 01:37:11.831
- Who?
- Linda, my roommate.

01:37:11.930 --> 01:37:14.206
She disappeared the day
that mountain showed up.

01:37:16.273 --> 01:37:18.377
- The wimp.
- The wimp.

01:37:20.344 --> 01:37:21.513
Seize them!

01:37:21.613 --> 01:37:24.516
[clamoring]

01:37:25.649 --> 01:37:27.186
(Selena)
'Drive off.'

01:37:27.284 --> 01:37:28.820
(Lucy)
Let me go now!

01:37:28.913 --> 01:37:31.123
Nobody messes around
with Jimmy Olsen!

01:37:31.221 --> 01:37:33.358
Now, let-let go off me.
I'm with the press!

01:37:33.458 --> 01:37:36.361
[dramatic music]

01:38:05.022 --> 01:38:07.526
[mellow music]

01:38:20.639 --> 01:38:22.074
[gasps]

01:38:45.664 --> 01:38:46.927
[gasps]

01:38:48.699 --> 01:38:51.603
- Zaltar!
- Squirt.

01:38:54.072 --> 01:38:57.042
- Zaltar?
- Squirt.

01:38:58.842 --> 01:39:01.680
Zaltar, it's me.
It's-it's Kara.

01:39:01.779 --> 01:39:03.048
I know.

01:39:05.483 --> 01:39:06.551
Squirt.

01:39:09.754 --> 01:39:11.023
[spits]

01:39:12.123 --> 01:39:13.725
What is that?

01:39:15.025 --> 01:39:18.063
- Where are we?
- Nowhere.

01:39:20.898 --> 01:39:22.701
The Phantom Zone?

01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:25.704
It's lonely here, my Kara.

01:39:26.504 --> 01:39:27.739
So sad.

01:39:30.407 --> 01:39:34.379
I've been here forever,
and I shall stay here forever.

01:39:36.847 --> 01:39:38.583
- Ethan?
- Yes, my darling.

01:39:38.682 --> 01:39:41.520
Don't call me your darling.
You despise me.

01:39:41.618 --> 01:39:44.789
- Get me the Coffer of Shadow.
- Yes, my darling.

01:39:44.889 --> 01:39:46.125
Now..

01:39:47.458 --> 01:39:51.430
I think we need something..

01:39:53.230 --> 01:39:54.166
'...there.'

01:39:54.265 --> 01:39:55.534
[Bianca gasps]

01:39:59.470 --> 01:40:01.073
Oh, Jimmy.

01:40:01.872 --> 01:40:03.375
Oh, terrific.

01:40:03.474 --> 01:40:06.946
The old
dangling-in-a-cage routine.

01:40:07.045 --> 01:40:09.148
Pathetic, Selena.

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.552
- Who's that guy?
- He's my math teacher, I think.

01:40:13.651 --> 01:40:15.921
(Bianca)
'What are they for?'

01:40:16.020 --> 01:40:17.622
Insurance.

01:40:23.394 --> 01:40:25.097
But you can't just give up.

01:40:25.196 --> 01:40:27.166
You founded a whole city.

01:40:27.264 --> 01:40:30.235
I did, and then
I doomed it to destruction.

01:40:30.334 --> 01:40:33.005
That was an error. A tragic one.

01:40:33.103 --> 01:40:36.475
When you're my age and you make
as many tragic errors as I do

01:40:36.573 --> 01:40:39.111
it is a different tune
that you will sing.

01:40:39.210 --> 01:40:41.313
I will not.
I will never give up.

01:40:41.412 --> 01:40:43.648
I will never spend my entire
life in a place like this.

01:40:43.747 --> 01:40:46.518
- I would die first!
- Strong words.

01:40:46.617 --> 01:40:50.555
There are worst things than
dying, and I deserve every one.

01:41:07.404 --> 01:41:10.375
- What is this?
- A horse.

01:41:10.475 --> 01:41:12.144
I think.

01:41:12.243 --> 01:41:16.515
On Earth, I think
it's called a horse.

01:41:16.613 --> 01:41:19.584
- And you made this here?
- Mm.

01:41:21.685 --> 01:41:24.456
- Then you haven't given up.
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:41:24.555 --> 01:41:26.992
Earth, Zaltar.
Earth, a tree, a horse.

01:41:27.091 --> 01:41:28.593
You keep making things
from Earth.

01:41:28.692 --> 01:41:31.030
- The place intrigues me.
- Well, then, let's go there.

01:41:31.129 --> 01:41:32.697
Certainly.
When is the next train?

01:41:32.797 --> 01:41:33.732
Oh!

01:41:34.966 --> 01:41:36.001
What is a train?

01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:38.203
[laughing]

01:41:39.136 --> 01:41:40.739
What's so funny?

01:41:40.838 --> 01:41:42.274
Don't laugh at me, Zaltar.

01:41:42.373 --> 01:41:45.744
I, I'm only laughing at myself.

01:41:45.843 --> 01:41:47.679
For you..

01:41:47.778 --> 01:41:49.881
...I weep.

01:41:49.981 --> 01:41:51.883
Is this train
a way out of here?

01:41:51.983 --> 01:41:54.586
There is no way out of here.

01:41:54.685 --> 01:41:57.722
That is the point
of the Phantom Zone.

01:41:57.821 --> 01:41:59.624
My neighbors know,
the criminals

01:41:59.723 --> 01:42:02.094
the corrupt,
the evil, they're here.

01:42:02.193 --> 01:42:03.963
Over the hill there.

01:42:04.062 --> 01:42:06.565
With no way out.

01:42:06.664 --> 01:42:09.902
But there's always a way out.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:13.172
'If there's a way in,
there's a way out.'

01:42:16.073 --> 01:42:17.676
There is a way.

01:42:19.171 --> 01:42:21.713
- But it's impossible.
- Why?

01:42:21.813 --> 01:42:23.815
'No, it wouldn't work.'

01:42:23.914 --> 01:42:26.085
'You'll be swept into a
singularity if it didn't work.'

01:42:26.183 --> 01:42:27.486
No.

01:42:27.584 --> 01:42:29.922
Forget I mentioned it.
Have a squirt instead.

01:42:35.325 --> 01:42:37.429
I could do it.

01:42:39.863 --> 01:42:42.434
Then, please.
At least teach me how.

01:42:42.533 --> 01:42:44.203
There's nothing to teach.

01:42:44.301 --> 01:42:46.738
You can't, as they say,
practice at the rift.

01:42:46.838 --> 01:42:49.808
You get one chance only.

01:42:49.906 --> 01:42:53.412
- The rift?
- Sure, you won't have a squirt?

01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:56.615
'Once you get used to it,
I think it's delicious.'

01:43:03.220 --> 01:43:05.257
You're right.

01:43:05.356 --> 01:43:07.960
You are absolutely right.

01:43:10.828 --> 01:43:14.299
There is enough doom and gloom
in the air already.

01:43:14.398 --> 01:43:16.601
And it is better
to accept defeat

01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:19.471
than to take a chance and try
like fools to redeem ourselves

01:43:19.570 --> 01:43:21.806
and save our city
and all those who we love there.

01:43:21.905 --> 01:43:24.443
Plus, all the people on Earth
that this wicked sorceress

01:43:24.541 --> 01:43:26.711
is going to make suffer
just because of us.

01:43:26.811 --> 01:43:28.247
Cheers!

01:43:32.149 --> 01:43:34.519
We could die trying.

01:43:34.618 --> 01:43:37.156
[clicks tongue]
But we won't.

01:43:37.254 --> 01:43:39.524
We won't. Come on.

01:43:47.464 --> 01:43:50.569
[wind whooshing]

01:44:07.351 --> 01:44:09.354
(Selena)
'Tomorrow.'

01:44:09.453 --> 01:44:12.424
Thursday. Friday.

01:44:12.523 --> 01:44:14.393
Just like here,
we go for the cops first, right?

01:44:14.492 --> 01:44:16.761
Hm, and the army.

01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:19.965
By Saturday, we have
the continental United States

01:44:20.064 --> 01:44:22.001
Mexico, Canada.

01:44:22.099 --> 01:44:24.003
[whirring]

01:44:25.664 --> 01:44:28.473
(Bianca)
'Oh, my God, Selena.
It's the box.'

01:44:28.572 --> 01:44:31.143
- Hush it up!
- No.

01:44:31.242 --> 01:44:33.273
What the box wants..

01:44:33.377 --> 01:44:35.647
...the box gets.

01:44:39.383 --> 01:44:40.319
[explosion]

[intense music]

01:44:51.395 --> 01:44:55.034
- What is it?
- Fascinating.

01:44:55.132 --> 01:44:56.735
[laughs]

01:44:57.501 --> 01:44:59.038
I don't know.

01:45:00.837 --> 01:45:02.074
(Supergirl)
Is this it?

01:45:02.173 --> 01:45:03.442
Is this the way out?

01:45:03.541 --> 01:45:04.743
(Zaltar)
Not yet!

01:45:04.842 --> 01:45:07.947
This is the Quantum Vortex!

01:45:08.046 --> 01:45:11.483
We must risk our destruction
in it.

01:45:11.583 --> 01:45:13.552
To move mountains..

01:45:13.652 --> 01:45:15.720
...you must make sacrifices.

01:45:15.819 --> 01:45:18.123
(Supergirl)
Zaltar, I'm scared!

01:45:18.222 --> 01:45:20.525
(Zaltar)
Accept your fears.

01:45:21.325 --> 01:45:23.462
Confront your demons.

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:27.366
Find your destiny
in the maelstrom!

01:45:27.466 --> 01:45:29.568

[music continues]

01:46:17.614 --> 01:46:20.119
Zaltar, I can't. I can't.

01:46:20.217 --> 01:46:23.383
You...can!

01:46:24.622 --> 01:46:26.058
[Zaltar grunts]

Two specks. Look!

01:46:56.587 --> 01:46:58.890
What do I do?

01:46:58.989 --> 01:47:02.627
How do you murder someone
in the Phantom Zone?

01:47:06.596 --> 01:47:09.429
She's with some old guy,
it looks like.

01:47:09.534 --> 01:47:12.271
Move, huh? Come on!

01:47:12.370 --> 01:47:14.434
Calm down, okay?

01:47:14.539 --> 01:47:15.640
Ah.

01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:18.710
