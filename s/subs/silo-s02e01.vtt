00:36.870 --> 00:38.288
No light past here, Tim.

00:39.498 --> 00:42.251
Engineering sent a message for my dad.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.888
- What are you doing here?
- Message from engineering.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.016
Why did you let him come, Roy?

00:59.017 --> 01:01.478
Because Timmy talked him into it.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.775
What do you think?

01:07.985 --> 01:09.486
I don't think we have a choice.

01:12.573 --> 01:13.866
Yeah, me neither.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.077
- Take him to safety now.
- You got it.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.956
- Go. Get out of here.
- Dad. Dad.

01:26.211 --> 01:27.254
Five bells.

01:44.354 --> 01:46.481
What the fuck is with the bells?

01:47.191 --> 01:49.233
At an agreed upon number of bells,
they attack.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.985
What number would that be?

01:50.986 --> 01:53.154
Apparently it's three.

01:53.155 --> 01:54.364
Ready!

01:57.409 --> 01:59.203
Shut your eyes! Look away!

02:03.665 --> 02:04.665
Positions!

02:04.666 --> 02:06.292
Take Russell alive. Understood?

02:06.293 --> 02:08.586
- For freedom!
- For freedom!

02:09.838 --> 02:11.798
Keep moving! Keep Moving!

02:27.523 --> 02:28.857
Keep moving!

02:31.443 --> 02:34.071
Fall back! Fall back!

02:43.956 --> 02:45.331
My hand slipped. I didn't mean to--

02:45.332 --> 02:47.417
I know.

02:50.379 --> 02:51.755
Why wouldn't he open the door?

02:53.048 --> 02:54.716
He was told not to.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.682
Do you think Russell was lying?

03:03.433 --> 03:04.476
I don't know.

03:08.272 --> 03:09.690
Well, there's one way to find out.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.444
And if he was lying?

03:19.533 --> 03:20.909
We're all dead anyway.

03:49.021 --> 03:50.271
Well, let's go outside.

03:50.272 --> 03:52.107
Let's go outside!

05:13.063 --> 05:14.815
Oh, my God.

08:36.808 --> 08:37.726
Come on.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.129
Come on!

10:32.966 --> 10:34.593
Fuck. Shit.

16:19.646 --> 16:20.564
Okay.

17:06.068 --> 17:07.736
Come on, you don't want to be late.

17:12.950 --> 17:14.785
Everybody, this is Juliette.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.286
Is she a criminal?

17:17.287 --> 17:20.789
No, Barney, she's not a criminal.
She's just new to Mechanical.

17:20.790 --> 17:23.669
Moved down from the Mids.
I think she lost a bet or something.

17:25.796 --> 17:27.381
Come on down, little one.

17:37.975 --> 17:38.976
Okay, listen up.

17:39.560 --> 17:42.520
New load every five minutes. You got it?

17:42.521 --> 17:43.855
I already told her how it works.

17:43.856 --> 17:46.024
I don't know if you told her right.

17:46.859 --> 17:50.778
You see, Recycling is only supposed
to put hopeless stuff down the chute,

17:50.779 --> 17:53.949
but, they all forget about it.

17:54.575 --> 17:58.203
This is the last chance for anything
before it goes to the incinerator.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.248
The good stuff goes back to Recycling.

18:01.874 --> 18:05.002
And the really good stuff goes to Walker.

19:20.619 --> 19:21.994
It's hotter down here.

19:21.995 --> 19:24.205
You drink until your pee is clear.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.083
Gladys, you are gross.

19:26.792 --> 19:29.585
You want to know what's gross,
Shirley-whirly?

19:29.586 --> 19:31.420
Falling asleep on the belt,

19:31.421 --> 19:35.092
your hair gets caught in the rollers,
rips half your scalp off.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.803
- Walker?
- Incinerator.

19:38.804 --> 19:39.972
Walker hates toys.

19:40.681 --> 19:41.639
Can I have it?

19:41.640 --> 19:42.724
What for?

19:43.600 --> 19:45.726
If I get a minute, I can fix it.

19:45.727 --> 19:48.939
Well, if you got a minute to spare,
then you can do some of my shift.

19:52.693 --> 19:55.529
- We keeping you awake?
- No.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.490
You know, you don't have to
stay at Mrs. Weaver's if you don't want.

19:59.491 --> 20:00.993
You can come stay with my dad and me.

20:02.077 --> 20:03.287
No, thanks.

20:05.330 --> 20:06.623
Suit yourself.

20:19.303 --> 20:21.345
<i>It's gonna get awful lonely
for you down here</i>

20:21.346 --> 20:23.599
with no one of your own age to talk to.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.645
Maybe you don't like having friends.

20:30.272 --> 20:31.773
What are you working on?

20:32.399 --> 20:34.651
- Nothing.
- Really?

20:38.447 --> 20:39.656
This a toy shop?

20:40.157 --> 20:42.158
I was just gonna give it five minutes.

20:42.159 --> 20:43.534
In here, you work for me.

20:43.535 --> 20:46.330
You work for me and the Silo,
but mainly me.

20:48.582 --> 20:49.791
You want something to fix...

20:52.503 --> 20:53.504
fix this.

20:58.884 --> 21:00.344
I saw that on the trash line.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.514
Well, see if you can get it working.

21:09.895 --> 21:10.811
What is it?

21:10.812 --> 21:12.648
Guess you better figure that out.

21:17.861 --> 21:18.946
It's been a while.

21:20.864 --> 21:22.241
A while since what?

21:24.493 --> 21:25.786
Since I had a friend.

21:30.624 --> 21:33.001
After my mom died...

21:33.544 --> 21:35.337
After your mother killed herself.

21:36.755 --> 21:38.674
Down here, we don't dance around.

21:39.550 --> 21:41.342
If a pump ain't working, we--

21:41.343 --> 21:46.430
we don't say "It might not be operating
at its projected capacity."

21:46.431 --> 21:47.599
We say it's broke.

21:49.768 --> 21:51.979
It's sad. It's awful.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.023
But your mother killed herself.

21:58.360 --> 21:59.319
Yeah...

22:00.779 --> 22:05.450
well, the other kids kind of
avoided me like it was catching,

22:05.951 --> 22:07.410
or they didn't really know
what else to say.

22:07.411 --> 22:10.998
So, it's been a while.

22:13.667 --> 22:14.667
Hey.

22:14.668 --> 22:18.005
You know what?
A few years ago, I got pneumonia.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.548
How I got it down here I'll never know.

22:20.549 --> 22:22.634
But I was sick as hell,

22:23.635 --> 22:27.472
and Dr. Stern got me some penicillin,
which did the trick.

22:29.683 --> 22:31.018
But that first night...

22:33.145 --> 22:34.771
I had an awful dream.

22:35.731 --> 22:37.983
Only it wasn't a dream.
It happened when I woke up.

22:39.484 --> 22:45.032
I opened my eyes and I realized
that while I'd been asleep,

22:45.616 --> 22:46.825
everybody had gone.

22:48.202 --> 22:49.411
I was totally alone.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.458
It's the worst feeling I ever had.

22:57.002 --> 22:59.921
I opened that door.
I went out in the corridor.

22:59.922 --> 23:03.591
I yelled, "Is anybody out there?
Anybody out there?"

23:03.592 --> 23:04.927
I yelled over and over,

23:06.053 --> 23:09.806
until Fred down the alley
told me to shut the fuck up, it was 3 a.m.

23:13.769 --> 23:15.062
Best words I ever heard.

23:26.114 --> 23:27.324
I'm calling it.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.467
You get Walker to fix it?

23:46.468 --> 23:47.970
No, I did it.

23:49.596 --> 23:50.597
You can have it.

23:51.348 --> 23:54.142
What? Why? I'm not a baby.
I don't want a toy.

23:54.643 --> 23:55.644
Shirley.

23:56.270 --> 23:57.729
She's just trying to make up.

23:58.355 --> 24:00.983
Just accept it and move on.

24:04.403 --> 24:05.404
How'd you fix it?

24:08.490 --> 24:10.825
There was a coiled spring inside
but it broke.

24:10.826 --> 24:12.578
So I soldered it at Walker's.

25:05.839 --> 25:07.049
Hello?

25:09.301 --> 25:10.511
Is someone there?

25:25.901 --> 25:26.860
Come on.

25:37.162 --> 25:38.372
Come on.

28:37.134 --> 28:38.218
No!

30:20.237 --> 30:21.446
Okay.

31:20.589 --> 31:21.924
Hey.

31:41.485 --> 31:42.778
What is that?

31:44.404 --> 31:46.322
It's from before the rebellion, I think.

31:46.323 --> 31:49.117
Other than that, no idea.

31:52.663 --> 31:56.208
One time, I came here with Knox
and some of his friends,

31:56.792 --> 31:58.001
and I fell asleep over there.

31:58.585 --> 32:00.921
They forgot about me or something.

32:01.505 --> 32:04.465
Anyway, they left me
and turned out the lights,

32:04.466 --> 32:06.760
and I woke up and I couldn't see a thing.

32:08.053 --> 32:09.554
Did they come back for you?

32:09.555 --> 32:10.639
Nah.

32:11.181 --> 32:12.599
Then how'd you get out?

32:14.685 --> 32:15.686
I didn't.

32:16.228 --> 32:18.021
I've stayed here the rest of my life.

32:22.234 --> 32:24.862
I went really, really slowly.

32:26.196 --> 32:27.406
But I found my way.

32:29.575 --> 32:30.576
I couldn't do that.

32:31.869 --> 32:32.870
Sure you could have.

32:33.620 --> 32:36.957
What else are you gonna do? Die?

32:55.267 --> 32:56.101
What the hell?

38:43.198 --> 38:44.199
Hello?

40:14.623 --> 40:15.541
Okay.

41:05.090 --> 41:06.049
Okay.

43:37.534 --> 43:38.744
Hey!

43:42.581 --> 43:45.667
Good. You heard the music.

43:46.335 --> 43:48.336
I love that song.

43:48.337 --> 43:51.048
So, one thing.

43:52.716 --> 43:54.593
You tried to open the door...

43:58.847 --> 44:02.517
I get it, you know, you see a closed door,

44:02.518 --> 44:04.144
what's on the other side?

44:04.645 --> 44:06.480
You know, I understand.

44:08.607 --> 44:10.567
Thing is, you do that again...

44:12.569 --> 44:13.779
and I'm gonna kill you.
