WEBVTT

00:19.186 --> 00:20.854
Hey, what's your name?

00:22.564 --> 00:23.774
Juliette.

00:26.818 --> 00:30.113
Juliette? like the play?

00:31.198 --> 00:32.198
Yeah.

00:34.076 --> 00:36.870
- Is that a thing here too?
- Yeah.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.664
Where are you from?

00:40.165 --> 00:44.293
I came from outside, from another silo.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.378
What silo?

00:45.379 --> 00:47.005
There's 50.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.884
Fifty?

00:51.927 --> 00:54.011
Yeah, this is 17.

00:54.012 --> 00:58.391
So, the closest ones are 15, 16 and 18.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.935
So, how far did you walk?

01:02.604 --> 01:04.230
- I don't know, like--
- Where was the sun?

01:08.944 --> 01:10.195
I don't-- Who--

01:12.948 --> 01:14.283
Look, who are you?

01:15.367 --> 01:17.119
Hey. No, wait!

01:21.248 --> 01:23.458
Look, I wanna talk,

01:24.126 --> 01:29.131
but you're gonna have to--
You have to give me something.

01:33.177 --> 01:34.636
My name is Solo.

01:36.805 --> 01:37.806
Solo?

01:38.557 --> 01:39.558
Yes.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.313
Solo what?

01:44.980 --> 01:46.481
Just Solo.

01:47.149 --> 01:49.442
'Cause I'm in here all by myself.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.569
So I'm Solo.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.618
And no one forced the people out.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.579
They chose to leave.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.211
And when they did it was a nice day.

02:08.794 --> 02:14.926
Everybody was smiling
but then that dust started to blow again,

02:14.927 --> 02:20.640
and I think the poison
went away for a bit but it came back

02:20.641 --> 02:23.644
and a lot of it,
and that's when they all died.

02:24.436 --> 02:26.729
But people who go out to clean,
they're dead in three minutes.

02:26.730 --> 02:30.692
So, how did they survive longer than that?

02:31.652 --> 02:33.028
I don't know. How did you?

02:35.239 --> 02:37.199
I had a suit on and--

02:38.867 --> 02:42.787
Hey, did you get sent out like Ron?

02:42.788 --> 02:45.123
- Ron? Who's Ron?
- Ron Tucker.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.333
The cleaner who didn't clean.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.170
He thought it was safe outside.
He wanted to go out.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.798
But when he did, he didn't clean.

02:53.382 --> 02:59.513
He just-- He wrote "lies"
in the dirt on the lens.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.353
Then he just went around
the corner out of sight.

03:06.937 --> 03:12.525
Then two days later,
they painted on the screen, "lies,"

03:12.526 --> 03:17.197
right over what he had written,
and that's when the fighting started.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.033
So Russell put me in here.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.830
Russell was the head of IT.
I was his shadow.

03:25.831 --> 03:26.831
And Russell told me,

03:26.832 --> 03:29.626
"Don't, no matter what,

03:30.252 --> 03:35.632
never let anyone in the vault... ever."

03:42.055 --> 03:43.974
But why did everyone go out?

03:45.517 --> 03:47.352
'cause they thought it was safe.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.689
'Cause this guy said it was safe,
that's why they just...

03:51.356 --> 03:53.107
No, because
they didn't see him die.

03:53.108 --> 03:54.358
They didn't see him die.

03:54.359 --> 03:58.655
So they thought maybe,
you know, maybe he was still alive.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.206
And then everyone went out?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.249
Yeah.

04:11.460 --> 04:12.503
What?

04:17.132 --> 04:18.341
I didn't fucking clean.

04:21.720 --> 04:25.181
A suit-- I need to get back.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.475
Wait! What?

06:04.031 --> 06:06.033
- Get your hands off him!
- Mom...

06:07.284 --> 06:08.869
Mom! Go home!

06:12.039 --> 06:14.333
It's gonna be okay! I'll be all right!

06:16.335 --> 06:17.753
Teddy!

06:18.545 --> 06:21.506
He was set up.
They put the graffiti up themselves.

06:21.507 --> 06:22.925
He was not set up.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.136
He did it. And I told him I was proud.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.056
This is our home down here.

06:29.723 --> 06:34.978
These are our walls,
and we can mark them up if we want.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.066
Except they have him now.

06:39.775 --> 06:42.109
We all know
what you're afraid of, Evelyn.

06:42.110 --> 06:43.737
We all know what they can do.

06:44.404 --> 06:48.325
They're gonna want to make an example
out of someone from Mechanical.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.454
But we're not gonna let 'em.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.706
- Are we?
- No.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.251
- Are we?
- No.

07:00.337 --> 07:01.922
We're not gonna let it be your son.

07:50.095 --> 07:51.345
So, why am I here?

07:51.346 --> 07:54.683
I thought we should start with <i>The Order</i>.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.728
Well, I tried to forget everything.

08:01.231 --> 08:02.232
Especially that.

08:05.736 --> 08:06.945
But some things remain.

08:08.071 --> 08:11.617
"In the event of a failed cleaning,
prepare for war."

08:13.785 --> 08:14.786
And graffiti.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.081
You're supposed to crack down on graffiti.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.919
Particularly anything
that might support a rebellion.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.173
Or "Anything that glorifies

08:27.174 --> 08:29.760
- the person who failed to clean."
- "...who failed to clean."

08:35.015 --> 08:38.308
Have you made
any arrests for the graffiti?

08:38.309 --> 08:40.270
One man down in Mechanical.

08:40.979 --> 08:41.980
What did he write?

08:42.731 --> 08:44.566
Same as I saw yesterday.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.530
Juliette lives.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.405
Did you catch him on camera?

08:51.406 --> 08:53.950
No, we were tipped.

08:53.951 --> 08:57.370
Most of the cameras
below 120 have been knocked out.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.288
Nichols must have told them.

08:59.289 --> 09:00.998
How did she know about the cameras?

09:00.999 --> 09:04.044
As far as I can tell,
she simply figured it out.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.756
She really was something, wasn't she?

09:08.715 --> 09:12.052
Outside of my analytics entirely.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.515
I only met her twice.

09:18.559 --> 09:21.144
She didn't strike me as
someone who would want to go out.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.523
She was caught with a red-level relic.

09:25.524 --> 09:28.569
A hard drive from before the rebellion.

09:30.863 --> 09:31.946
What was on it?

09:31.947 --> 09:37.369
Other than a 200-year-old cleaning video
that Nichols flashed on the screen,

09:38.328 --> 09:40.455
I don't know. I destroyed it.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.209
Did she say that she wanted to go out?

09:45.210 --> 09:47.963
- She was going out no matter what.
- But did she say it?

09:48.463 --> 09:50.257
Yes. She said it.

09:56.013 --> 09:58.807
The next time
you make an arrest for graffiti,

09:59.474 --> 10:02.352
make sure they're from
the Up Top or the Mids.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.104
<i>The Order</i> says--

10:05.105 --> 10:09.775
<i>The Order</i> says to blame Mechanical and
unite the rest of the Silo against them.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.902
I know that.

10:10.903 --> 10:12.487
But Juliette...

10:14.698 --> 10:16.283
she was singular.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.620
No one had ever done
anything like that before.

10:20.871 --> 10:22.998
So you need to think outside of <i>The Order</i>.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.168
I'm not saying it'll be easy.

10:27.836 --> 10:28.837
It might be like

10:30.422 --> 10:32.633
trying to think of
a color that you've never seen.

10:33.550 --> 10:34.760
But try.

10:38.847 --> 10:42.351
And release the man from
Mechanical that you arrested.

10:42.935 --> 10:44.144
Show some mercy.

10:45.354 --> 10:48.065
Now, if you don't mind, I'd really
like to get the fuck out of here.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.072
Juliette went to Silo number 17?

10:56.073 --> 10:57.157
Yes.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.410
Could she survive in there?

11:01.411 --> 11:02.495
Unlikely.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.831
That silo's been dead for a long time.

11:06.834 --> 11:10.003
From before I made you my shadow.

11:23.976 --> 11:24.977
Shit.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.038
How are we doing on
the people I had you pull in?

12:26.663 --> 12:29.624
The ones that may have seen
what Nichols put on their computers.

12:29.625 --> 12:31.334
They're all being put on the medication.

12:31.335 --> 12:33.295
Saying it's for anxiety.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.298
What about the two that helped Nichols?

12:36.798 --> 12:38.674
Patrick Kennedy and Danny Bly.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.636
They're in Judicial seclusion.

12:41.637 --> 12:43.639
- Have they been medicated yet?
- No.

12:46.350 --> 12:47.351
Why?

13:00.906 --> 13:04.159
Don't know why
they have to tie these so damn tight.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.176
There we go.

13:24.388 --> 13:25.389
All right?

13:29.268 --> 13:30.394
Do you know who I am?

13:32.855 --> 13:34.731
Everyone knows who you are, Sims.

13:36.066 --> 13:39.319
Parents threaten their children with you
if they don't eat their broccoli.

13:40.112 --> 13:41.989
Kids gotta eat their broccoli.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.199
I eat mine.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.076
You gonna let me go?

13:48.453 --> 13:50.788
I'm gonna need
a little bit more than that.

13:50.789 --> 13:51.999
Oh, yeah.

13:54.376 --> 13:55.919
What more can I give you?

13:57.963 --> 13:59.590
You already took Doris.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.884
Your wife?

14:03.177 --> 14:07.931
Yes, my wife, fucknuts.

14:08.724 --> 14:12.394
There is nothing more
that you can take from me.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.105
And I've seen things.

14:15.606 --> 14:16.899
I know things.

14:20.277 --> 14:24.156
I know it's all a fucking lie.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.411
So how about we skip ahead to the part
where you stick a knife in my eye?

14:32.789 --> 14:35.417
Not everyone who knows things has to die.

14:37.336 --> 14:40.296
Can you stop
saying mysterious shit, please,

14:40.297 --> 14:44.426
for just a second, and get
to why the fuck I'm here?

14:48.055 --> 14:49.139
There's a drug.

14:50.307 --> 14:51.600
It makes you forget.

14:55.062 --> 14:56.104
Forget what?

14:58.065 --> 15:00.234
We'd start with
the things we want you to forget.

15:00.817 --> 15:03.612
Small dose should take
care of the last few weeks.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.282
What about a big dose?

15:08.283 --> 15:10.869
We can take you back to before Doris died.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.622
How would that work?

15:14.623 --> 15:18.418
What do I--
Wander around, wondering where she went?

15:22.923 --> 15:29.012
No. If this drug is real,
then I'm gonna go all the way back.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.765
I wanna go back 22 years.

15:32.933 --> 15:33.976
To before I met her.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.605
I want you to do that.
Because it's easier that way.

15:41.525 --> 15:42.860
We can do that for you.

15:43.569 --> 15:46.446
But there's something
you gonna have to do for us first.

15:55.497 --> 15:56.582
It's beautiful, isn't it?

16:03.964 --> 16:05.090
What was it?

16:08.886 --> 16:09.887
I don't know.

16:11.972 --> 16:14.515
The reason that I asked you to stop by...

16:14.516 --> 16:18.060
Have you finished the report
on Sheriff Nichols's cleaning?

16:18.061 --> 16:19.270
Almost.

16:19.271 --> 16:20.855
I need one more witness statement.

16:20.856 --> 16:23.775
Did Miss Nichols say she wanted to go out?

16:24.276 --> 16:26.069
According to the mayor,

16:26.820 --> 16:29.865
Mr. Sims and four of the five raiders
that were there, she did.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.326
I'm speaking to the fifth shortly.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.995
Well, then I'll let you get to it.

16:41.210 --> 16:42.127
Your Honor...

16:44.963 --> 16:46.298
I have the Syndrome.

16:48.926 --> 16:50.677
Sims told me an allowance had been made.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.097
I support his decision.

16:55.474 --> 17:00.270
It's time that we remove the stigma
caused unnecessarily by a few...

17:01.563 --> 17:04.066
discriminatory phrases in the Pact.

17:08.654 --> 17:12.824
You know, there's a theory
about what causes the Syndrome.

17:13.825 --> 17:17.246
That it's not a blood disorder
or a vitamin deficiency,

17:17.871 --> 17:23.544
it's just a natural human reaction
to an unnatural situation.

17:24.502 --> 17:28.757
Human beings are not
meant to live underground.

17:29.550 --> 17:32.845
None of us have walked
a straight line for more than 200 feet.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.851
Except for Juliette Nichols.

17:43.105 --> 17:44.731
When you finish
the report on her cleaning...

17:46.859 --> 17:47.860
let me see it first.

17:55.450 --> 17:56.451
Hey!

17:57.995 --> 17:59.245
What's that?

17:59.246 --> 18:00.330
Open it.

18:04.543 --> 18:05.711
What is it?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.059
It's chicken stew.

18:21.685 --> 18:22.686
It's not bad.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.479
I mean, I don't know,

18:25.480 --> 18:28.775
I can't tell anymore,
but I remember liking it at first.

18:32.863 --> 18:34.323
Oh, shit.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.576
- What?
- Nothin'.

18:38.994 --> 18:42.706
Just, wow, you were really hungry.

18:48.337 --> 18:49.379
No suit?

18:51.256 --> 18:55.134
Well, I found, like, some belts and stuff,

18:55.135 --> 18:58.597
but, like, ten feet of fabric
that wasn't destroyed.

18:59.598 --> 19:04.102
That's not enough to make
a suit and then my suit.

19:04.686 --> 19:07.105
I tore it to fucking shreds, so, no.

19:08.398 --> 19:12.569
Well, the suits were
only assembled in Room S.

19:13.278 --> 19:17.449
And the material for the suits
is in Critical Supply.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.536
But that's--

19:21.495 --> 19:22.496
Underwater?

19:23.914 --> 19:25.707
I hope they don't get wet.

19:26.667 --> 19:27.917
Sorry, what?

19:27.918 --> 19:29.878
I hope they do--

19:30.546 --> 19:31.838
Huh?

19:31.839 --> 19:33.130
- I--
- I know,

19:33.131 --> 19:35.174
I'm just-- I was trying to do a joke.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.010
But it's been a while, sorry.

19:41.849 --> 19:43.559
- Juliette?
- Yeah?

19:44.184 --> 19:45.602
Why didn't you clean?

19:49.815 --> 19:52.734
- 'Cause I said I wasn't gonna.
- Yeah, everybody says that.

19:55.863 --> 19:57.906
You know, I figured out why people clean.

20:00.033 --> 20:01.034
You know...

20:04.621 --> 20:10.252
people-- they end up cleaning,
'cause when they get outside, they--

20:11.086 --> 20:15.339
they see this beautiful sky,
and they see beautiful trees

20:15.340 --> 20:18.467
and grass and fucking flowers.

20:18.468 --> 20:20.094
And they feel like they need to.

20:20.095 --> 20:22.680
They wanna tell everyone on
the inside what it really looks like.

20:22.681 --> 20:24.349
How beautiful it is.

20:25.058 --> 20:27.019
- Yeah, but you didn't.
- No.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.687
No, I didn't,
'cause it's fucking bullshit.

20:29.688 --> 20:32.648
It's bullshit, 'cause I've seen
a recording of someone else's cleaning,

20:32.649 --> 20:36.569
where there were, like,
a bunch of creatures,

20:36.570 --> 20:38.446
they were going across the sky--

20:38.447 --> 20:40.449
Birds. They're called birds.

20:42.034 --> 20:45.787
Okay. So when I went out,
I saw these birds, right?

20:46.371 --> 20:47.496
But the way they were moving

20:47.497 --> 20:51.334
was exactly like the ones
that I had seen from that cleaning.

20:51.335 --> 20:53.044
But exactly.

20:53.045 --> 20:57.256
So, I knew that it wasn't the display
in the cafeteria that was a lie,

20:57.257 --> 20:58.967
it was what I was seeing.

20:59.843 --> 21:00.844
In the helmet.

21:01.803 --> 21:05.306
- I don't know how they do it.
- Very advanced computers.

21:05.307 --> 21:07.266
Okay, sure.
But it was a fucking lie, right?

21:07.267 --> 21:08.352
So why would I clean?

21:09.102 --> 21:10.436
No, I didn't clean.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.562
I walked.

21:11.563 --> 21:13.397
I walked and I walked

21:13.398 --> 21:18.320
and I didn't think that what I was doing
could lead to what happened here.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.822
- That I didn't know.
- You couldn't know.

21:34.378 --> 21:35.462
Why are you alive?

21:39.216 --> 21:43.095
Everyone else is dead,
but you survived. How?

21:44.638 --> 21:48.516
I just-- If I didn't,
who would guard the vault?

21:48.517 --> 21:51.311
No, but, like, how long
have you been in there? How--

21:52.521 --> 21:56.567
Alone, you say, and you have food, so--

21:57.609 --> 22:00.863
I just do my job, you know.
I just keep the door shut.

22:01.738 --> 22:02.906
I don't open it.

22:04.825 --> 22:06.368
- Ever?
- No.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.456
'Cause clearly someone's
tried to get in, so...

22:14.501 --> 22:18.296
I like to read, I play music--

22:18.297 --> 22:22.134
Solo? Can I just ask-- The--

22:24.761 --> 22:27.555
The bodies outside in the hall,

22:27.556 --> 22:29.640
they're not as old as the other ones.

22:29.641 --> 22:30.726
So...

22:32.519 --> 22:33.520
What happened?

23:06.512 --> 23:08.679
I haven't been able to find food,
so thank you.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.476
It was really nice.

23:13.393 --> 23:14.645
Thank you.

23:22.069 --> 23:25.197
I wasn't being nice,
I just needed you to eat the food.

23:28.534 --> 23:29.535
Why?

23:30.619 --> 23:33.871
'Cause if you ate the food,
then I would know that you were real

23:33.872 --> 23:35.457
and I wasn't imagining you.

23:38.502 --> 23:39.503
You imagine people?

23:41.129 --> 23:43.130
Wh-- Hey-- No, Solo.

23:43.131 --> 23:44.341
I--

24:18.041 --> 24:21.085
That's from when you
saved those kids from that madman.

24:21.086 --> 24:22.588
What was his name?

24:23.547 --> 24:24.965
I never speak it.

24:27.050 --> 24:28.677
Like he never was.

24:29.303 --> 24:30.304
That's good.

24:31.138 --> 24:32.222
And this.

24:33.432 --> 24:36.726
No raider can match
your marks on the pistol range.

24:36.727 --> 24:38.145
Still can't.

24:40.772 --> 24:42.024
Right you are, Reggie.

24:42.941 --> 24:44.234
Right you are.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.070
While I appreciate the visit, Mr. Sims--

24:48.071 --> 24:49.198
You can call me Rob.

24:50.199 --> 24:51.699
No, sir, I can't--

24:51.700 --> 24:56.204
It'll come as no surprise to you that all
retired raiders are being brought back

24:56.205 --> 24:57.997
due to the state of emergency.

24:57.998 --> 24:59.290
As they should.

24:59.291 --> 25:00.374
As we all should.

25:00.375 --> 25:05.714
What may come as a surprise to you,
is you're being sent down to Mechanical.

25:10.761 --> 25:12.261
A man my age?

25:12.262 --> 25:16.433
I figure we have a long history together,
helping each other.

25:18.227 --> 25:19.936
Calling in your debt.

25:19.937 --> 25:22.855
You asked for five minutes alone
with Archie Brent.

25:22.856 --> 25:24.316
I gave you ten.

25:28.278 --> 25:30.821
Just tell me I don't have to stay long
in Mechanical.

25:30.822 --> 25:33.074
Something about the air down there.

25:33.075 --> 25:34.535
Not long at all.

25:35.619 --> 25:38.120
Hey. Boss-- Hey. We didn't get to talk--

25:38.121 --> 25:39.915
- I don't have time.
- It's-- It's important.

25:40.582 --> 25:44.627
I asked you to watch Shirley
to find out what she's up to.

25:44.628 --> 25:46.171
Instead, you join her.

25:48.215 --> 25:49.842
You surprised that I know that?

25:51.635 --> 25:53.512
You think I only asked you to watch her?

25:55.430 --> 25:56.889
Okay, yeah, I--

25:56.890 --> 26:00.102
I was there, but--
That's why we need to talk.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.897
I appreciate you
coming up all this way, Jean.

26:04.398 --> 26:05.982
I know it's a long walk.

26:05.983 --> 26:08.610
I know what I saw! I'm not lying!

26:10.529 --> 26:14.824
Now, in the section of the Pact dealing
with the responsibilities of the sheriff,

26:14.825 --> 26:18.828
it states that one of them
is submitting a report to Judicial

26:18.829 --> 26:20.246
on every cleaning.

26:20.247 --> 26:22.165
That's why I asked you up.

26:23.250 --> 26:26.628
I didn't see Sheriff Nichols
until she was in custody.

26:28.672 --> 26:30.591
But you were there when she was arrested?

26:31.466 --> 26:32.551
Yes.

26:34.303 --> 26:35.804
In the cornfield?

26:36.430 --> 26:37.806
That's right.

26:38.390 --> 26:42.519
And before she took off running,
what did she say?

27:00.245 --> 27:01.246
Can't sleep?

27:03.373 --> 27:06.710
Yeah. Think I might've misjudged
my coffee cut-off time.

27:07.211 --> 27:08.212
You?

27:10.422 --> 27:11.715
Nerves.

27:14.009 --> 27:17.303
I didn't think we'd get another chance
at the birth lottery,

27:17.304 --> 27:21.557
but with the sheriff going out,
they're holding a bonus one tomorrow,

27:21.558 --> 27:23.936
drawing from the same pool as last time.

27:24.728 --> 27:27.231
My husband keeps telling me
we have better odds.

27:28.232 --> 27:29.483
I wish you luck.

27:30.859 --> 27:33.736
Rick and I want so badly to have a child,

27:33.737 --> 27:35.738
but we wonder
if we should even be having a baby

27:35.739 --> 27:37.157
with everything that's going on.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.709
Having a baby is a venture of hope.

27:52.047 --> 27:55.717
The people who planted these trees
didn't live long enough to sit under them.

28:00.472 --> 28:01.640
Do you have kids?

28:04.893 --> 28:05.978
Uh-huh.

28:06.603 --> 28:07.771
What's it like?

28:16.989 --> 28:18.365
With our first...

28:19.074 --> 28:21.284
I could hear her before I saw her.

28:21.285 --> 28:23.328
My ear to my wife's belly.

28:24.872 --> 28:26.707
You wonder for months who they'll be.

28:28.333 --> 28:33.964
What they'll look like,
and how they'll walk and smile and cry.

28:35.841 --> 28:38.218
And then one day, you meet them.

28:40.053 --> 28:41.430
And they're perfect.

28:46.351 --> 28:48.854
I think I better try to get some sleep.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.191
Phoebe Wells.

28:54.193 --> 28:55.402
Pete Nichols.

28:58.113 --> 28:59.947
- Oh, I am so sorry.
- That's okay.

28:59.948 --> 29:01.407
- What I said before--
- No.

29:01.408 --> 29:03.368
At least some good's come out of it.

29:06.830 --> 29:07.998
And I hope you win.

29:10.459 --> 29:11.460
Thank you.

29:13.003 --> 29:14.087
I better...

29:16.340 --> 29:17.591
Have a good night.

29:49.122 --> 29:50.040
Hey.

29:53.710 --> 29:56.296
- What?
- Oh, hey. Hold on.

30:03.512 --> 30:05.264
I had a thought.

30:05.931 --> 30:07.223
Firefighters.

30:07.224 --> 30:08.641
Yeah? What?

30:08.642 --> 30:10.351
They have helmets. They have suits. They--

30:10.352 --> 30:13.187
They have air tanks.
They go into smoke.

30:13.188 --> 30:14.565
No.

30:15.858 --> 30:19.610
They're not designed
to keep you alive outside. Come on.

30:19.611 --> 30:21.697
Yeah,
but cleaning suits aren't either.

30:29.329 --> 30:31.582
I could use a firefighter suit.

30:33.125 --> 30:34.417
That's not a bad idea.

30:34.418 --> 30:35.835
Yeah, you think so?

30:35.836 --> 30:38.588
- I-- 'Cause I wasn't sure.
- Where could I find one?

30:38.589 --> 30:41.966
Well, fire safety equipment
is in three places.

30:41.967 --> 30:44.635
It's in Engineering, 70 and 23.

30:44.636 --> 30:47.680
- Where on 23?
- Next to Recycling.

30:47.681 --> 30:51.768
- Okay.
- No, hey, but there might be a problem.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.712
I'm sorry. I know it's late.

31:19.713 --> 31:20.796
Has something happened?

31:20.797 --> 31:23.925
Well, you asked to see my report
on Sheriff Nichols's cleaning

31:23.926 --> 31:25.176
before I submitted it.

31:25.177 --> 31:26.302
And it couldn't wait?

31:26.303 --> 31:30.056
I spoke to the five raiders
who helped in the apprehension of Nichols.

31:30.057 --> 31:33.017
Four stated she said she wanted to go out.

31:33.018 --> 31:34.185
But one didn't?

31:34.186 --> 31:37.980
The fifth-- They say
they were just focused on their job.

31:37.981 --> 31:42.152
They say if the others heard her ask
to go out, then that's what she said.

31:42.861 --> 31:43.986
But you're not sure.

31:43.987 --> 31:45.655
When I was taking her up the stairs,

31:45.656 --> 31:48.074
Sheriff Nichols herself
told me she didn't say it.

31:48.075 --> 31:49.910
Wait. You're just saying this now?

31:52.704 --> 31:55.581
I wasn't sure
if I could believe her.

31:55.582 --> 31:59.418
I wanted to talk to the others,
but if witnesses had any doubts,

31:59.419 --> 32:01.921
there should have been an inquiry
before Nichols was sent out.

32:01.922 --> 32:03.423
- It's in--
- It's in the Pact. Yeah.

32:04.883 --> 32:06.260
I know.

32:08.345 --> 32:09.888
- Is there anything--
- No.

32:10.973 --> 32:12.057
I'll take it from here.

32:14.184 --> 32:16.144
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention, Sheriff.

32:17.062 --> 32:18.355
Good night.

33:40.479 --> 33:41.480
Knox.

33:44.816 --> 33:47.193
Shirley, turn around and go home.

33:47.194 --> 33:50.280
- Give us Teddy and we will.
- We're not gonna do that.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.118
Where'd you get the goons?

33:56.119 --> 33:59.789
- Goons? Come on, Shirl. They're deputies.
- Not the ones with the helmets.

33:59.790 --> 34:02.542
I can't let you just take somebody
out of custody!

34:02.543 --> 34:04.211
- Then release him!
- Free Teddy!

34:06.380 --> 34:08.422
Police. Move out!

34:10.092 --> 34:11.676
This is not who we are!

34:11.677 --> 34:14.136
Maybe this is who we are now!

34:14.137 --> 34:17.891
Free Teddy!

34:36.159 --> 34:38.535
Listen, we all want the same thing.

34:38.536 --> 34:39.704
We all want Teddy back.

34:39.705 --> 34:41.956
- Free Teddy! Free Teddy!
- Look--

35:01.518 --> 35:03.937
- Set him free!
- No!

35:17.910 --> 35:19.494
What are you doing?

35:24.208 --> 35:26.460
Get him in the back.

35:29.880 --> 35:31.215
- Coop?
- Cooper!

35:33.800 --> 35:34.800
It's okay.

35:34.801 --> 35:37.053
- You're okay, Coop.
- Coop.

35:37.054 --> 35:39.639
- Hey, buddy. You're okay.
- Coop, we're here.

35:39.640 --> 35:40.891
You're okay.

35:41.683 --> 35:42.683
Coop.

35:42.684 --> 35:44.685
- Coop.
- It's okay.

35:44.686 --> 35:46.104
It's all right.

35:50.859 --> 35:51.860
Buddy?

35:58.200 --> 36:00.452
Somebody help! Please!

36:56.466 --> 36:59.343
Nobody knows the asshole
who kicked it off.

36:59.344 --> 37:01.096
They weren't from Mechanical.

37:01.680 --> 37:02.931
<i>The other one?</i>

37:05.434 --> 37:06.435
Yeah.

37:07.352 --> 37:09.187
Mechanical born and raised.

37:09.188 --> 37:10.354
Terry Cooper.

37:10.355 --> 37:11.856
<i>Sweetest kid you'll ever meet.</i>

37:11.857 --> 37:13.066
<i>He was just--</i>

37:14.693 --> 37:18.280
Yeah, he was just trying
to stop the shithead with the firebomb.

37:20.490 --> 37:21.742
What do you need?

37:22.868 --> 37:23.994
<i>Well, boss,</i>

37:25.454 --> 37:27.246
we need everything.

37:27.247 --> 37:28.373
But first...

37:30.584 --> 37:31.627
we need you.

37:53.232 --> 37:54.483
Thanks for coming.

37:55.734 --> 37:57.818
We're safe down here,
no cameras, no listeners.

37:57.819 --> 38:00.656
Why didn't you just let us do
what we wanted to do?

38:01.281 --> 38:04.242
We would've gotten
Teddy, and everything would be fine.

38:04.243 --> 38:05.576
Really?

38:05.577 --> 38:07.204
You were gonna hide him forever?

38:27.432 --> 38:28.725
We lost Cooper.

38:35.023 --> 38:36.441
I just can't believe it.

38:39.778 --> 38:40.779
Me neither.

38:50.163 --> 38:51.831
Come on. Don't hurt your foot.

38:51.832 --> 38:53.958
You wanna punch something, punch me.

38:53.959 --> 38:55.502
Fuck.

38:56.962 --> 38:58.547
Ah, fuck.

39:00.424 --> 39:02.217
Didn't think you would actually do that.

39:03.510 --> 39:05.095
Neither did I.

39:14.605 --> 39:15.606
Shirl...

39:17.608 --> 39:19.443
you're not the only one who's angry.

39:22.237 --> 39:24.740
You're not the only one who lost Jules.

39:30.245 --> 39:32.539
Yeah, I'm not so sure we lost her.

39:36.752 --> 39:38.337
It's been two days.

39:39.838 --> 39:41.840
We don't know what she saw over that hill.

39:42.549 --> 39:48.347
She might be out there somewhere,
still alive.

39:52.059 --> 39:53.434
Look, I--

39:53.435 --> 39:55.062
All right. All right.

39:55.646 --> 39:58.232
I wanna know the truth
just as bad as you do,

39:58.899 --> 40:00.859
but we can't do it
the way you've been doing it.

40:04.279 --> 40:05.489
Then how?

40:07.950 --> 40:10.911
You remember when we were kids,
and we used to explore down there?

40:12.829 --> 40:15.082
Remember that wall of names we found?

40:16.375 --> 40:17.501
Yeah?

40:19.628 --> 40:21.338
We didn't know what it meant then.

40:24.341 --> 40:25.758
Now I think I do.

40:25.759 --> 40:27.426
One morning at dawn,

40:27.427 --> 40:31.056
I will shut down
the cafeteria display screens

40:31.765 --> 40:33.015
for routine maintenance,

40:33.016 --> 40:37.187
as well as all of the cameras
in the sheriff's office.

40:38.313 --> 40:41.108
I'll operate the air lock,

40:42.734 --> 40:45.112
and you'll have five minutes
to get up over the hill

40:46.530 --> 40:51.076
and out of sight
before I reactivate the screens.

40:54.997 --> 40:56.665
Are you sure you wanna do this?

40:59.168 --> 41:00.961
When do I get my suit?

41:03.714 --> 41:07.801
Well, as head of IT, I have my own suit.

41:10.387 --> 41:14.182
I thought maybe we could modify that.

41:14.183 --> 41:15.892
You're nine feet tall.

41:15.893 --> 41:20.439
Which is why I think
it's best to have your own made.

41:21.023 --> 41:23.734
I'll say it's for a prospective shadow.

41:24.318 --> 41:27.028
Normally, they send a team to measure you,

41:27.029 --> 41:32.200
but as this is going to be
just between you and I,

41:32.201 --> 41:35.494
I will do it.

41:35.495 --> 41:37.831
I'll measure you.

42:07.569 --> 42:09.571
They start with the arms.

42:10.239 --> 42:11.573
Like--

42:26.380 --> 42:28.464
Don't you need
to write them down?

42:28.465 --> 42:29.883
No.

42:34.638 --> 42:35.847
Bernard.

42:35.848 --> 42:36.932
Yes?

42:38.517 --> 42:40.018
May I ask you a question?

42:43.063 --> 42:44.439
Have I been helpful?

42:45.524 --> 42:47.484
You're the only person I can talk to.

42:50.988 --> 42:52.781
But you just need to talk.

42:53.574 --> 42:57.577
My opinion is neither required nor needed.

42:57.578 --> 43:01.582
They are both required and needed.

43:02.165 --> 43:03.333
Yet ignored.

43:04.251 --> 43:07.628
I said that you should release the man
who did the graffiti in Mechanical.

43:07.629 --> 43:09.172
He was released.

43:09.173 --> 43:13.593
Yes, but not until there was a firebombing
and a shooting that claimed two lives.

43:13.594 --> 43:15.219
- Was that you?
- No.

43:15.220 --> 43:17.764
Really? Because it seems
straight out of <i>The Order</i>.

43:18.724 --> 43:20.017
Get them to retaliate,

43:20.893 --> 43:24.313
which in turn stirs up
anti-Mechanical resentment in the Silo,

43:25.230 --> 43:28.192
which allows you to crush a rebellion.

43:31.028 --> 43:32.320
Wasn't me.

43:32.321 --> 43:33.488
Are you sure?

43:34.907 --> 43:36.366
I wouldn't lie to you.

43:37.618 --> 43:39.786
- And yet you already have.
- How?

43:40.621 --> 43:44.082
Juliette Nichols did not ask to go out,
did she?

43:50.672 --> 43:51.673
No.

43:52.299 --> 43:54.050
You got all the measurements
that you need?

43:54.051 --> 43:55.426
Yes.

43:55.427 --> 43:57.345
Well, then you can leave now.

43:57.346 --> 43:59.264
Don't come back without my suit.

44:09.358 --> 44:10.733
Solo?

44:10.734 --> 44:11.901
Solo, you were right.

44:11.902 --> 44:15.072
It's underwater,
but I think I can make it work.

44:15.614 --> 44:17.782
If I drop into the water,

44:17.783 --> 44:19.825
I could go down one level,

44:19.826 --> 44:22.161
and I can maybe make it
through the apartments

44:22.162 --> 44:23.913
and into the alleyway,

44:23.914 --> 44:27.500
but I'm gonna have to build something
that can pump air down to me.

44:27.501 --> 44:31.588
Which means I'm gonna need you
to run it while I'm under.

44:34.716 --> 44:35.759
Solo?

44:40.055 --> 44:42.265
I need your help.

44:42.266 --> 44:44.433
I can't come out!

44:44.434 --> 44:46.645
But you've been out before.

44:47.646 --> 44:48.897
I know-- Look--

44:50.148 --> 44:51.190
The two bodies in the hall--

44:51.191 --> 44:53.193
I'm not supposed to open the door.

44:54.903 --> 44:58.197
You gave me food.
You opened the door to give me food.

44:58.198 --> 45:00.074
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

45:00.075 --> 45:02.244
I don't open the door when you're here.

45:09.084 --> 45:10.918
Look, I don't wanna push you.

45:10.919 --> 45:13.380
I don't need to know what happened here, okay?

45:14.173 --> 45:15.174
I get it.

45:16.216 --> 45:17.926
I know you don't wanna talk about it,

45:18.510 --> 45:21.805
and I know that you've lost everyone
in your life.

45:24.683 --> 45:25.808
But I need to get back.

45:25.809 --> 45:28.520
I need to get back, okay?

45:29.396 --> 45:31.647
And I know you're not supposed
to open the door--

45:31.648 --> 45:34.693
- Well, it's my job.
- But I need you to help me.

45:35.986 --> 45:37.236
Okay?

45:37.237 --> 45:40.032
I need you to help me save m--

45:40.908 --> 45:43.869
10,000 people, Solo.

45:45.370 --> 45:46.872
10,000 people.

45:49.583 --> 45:52.502
Look, I know it's not gonna
make up for what happened here,

45:52.503 --> 45:53.878
but if I could get home--

45:53.879 --> 45:56.798
If you could help me get home,

45:58.342 --> 46:02.846
then maybe we could stop
what happened here from happening there.

46:04.932 --> 46:06.225
But I--

46:08.936 --> 46:10.562
I fucking need you.

46:16.276 --> 46:17.444
Please.

46:24.826 --> 46:26.119
I can't.

47:08.120 --> 47:10.581
"We will get in sooner or later."

47:27.973 --> 47:29.099
Okay.

47:31.935 --> 47:32.936
I get it.

47:40.694 --> 47:42.154
It's okay. I get it.

47:44.573 --> 47:46.074
Thanks for the food, I'll--

47:48.243 --> 47:49.369
I'll see you around.

47:50.704 --> 47:53.039
Wait!

47:53.040 --> 47:54.541
What are you gonna do?

47:55.667 --> 47:57.169
I don't know. I'll--

47:57.753 --> 47:59.087
I'll figure it out.

48:16.313 --> 48:17.522
What are you feeling?

48:17.523 --> 48:19.482
Excited.

48:19.483 --> 48:21.026
Nervous.

48:21.735 --> 48:24.404
No, I mean, are you numb?
Can you feel this?

48:26.198 --> 48:27.407
Sorry.

48:28.200 --> 48:29.451
It's numb.

48:30.285 --> 48:31.245
Good.

48:32.037 --> 48:33.830
There's nothing to be nervous about.

48:35.207 --> 48:37.459
It'll be over before you know it.

48:41.672 --> 48:42.506
Dr. Nichols.

48:44.216 --> 48:47.845
We wanted to let you know
how grateful we are.

48:50.389 --> 48:55.852
And how acutely aware we are that
this possibility only exists

48:55.853 --> 48:58.646
because your daughter--

48:58.647 --> 48:59.815
Thank you.

49:02.276 --> 49:03.819
I hope you have a girl.

50:17.351 --> 50:19.394
You're now free to make a baby.

50:22.231 --> 50:24.191
No. Hold still.

50:28.487 --> 50:31.031
A couple of stitches,
and you'll be good to go.

50:40.332 --> 50:41.583
Don't go!

51:01.436 --> 51:02.812
Do I look bad?

51:02.813 --> 51:04.522
No. I just--

51:04.523 --> 51:08.944
I thought maybe
you'd look different, that--

51:12.322 --> 51:14.658
I've never come out this far.

51:18.745 --> 51:20.122
It's so big. There's...

51:23.166 --> 51:25.794
It seems like it's just so much space.

51:30.132 --> 51:31.216
You wanna see more?

51:36.930 --> 51:37.930
Yeah.

51:37.931 --> 51:39.850
Okay. Where do you wanna go?

51:46.607 --> 51:47.733
You wanna go up?

51:56.783 --> 51:58.159
Up?

51:58.160 --> 51:59.244
Okay.

52:00.787 --> 52:01.830
Come on.

52:17.179 --> 52:18.722
Yeah. Careful.

52:26.188 --> 52:27.773
Hey.

52:28.565 --> 52:31.609
- It's okay. Hey.
- Stop.

52:31.610 --> 52:33.444
- Don't!
- Hey.

52:33.445 --> 52:35.279
No. Wait, did I hurt you? Are you okay?

52:35.280 --> 52:37.866
- No! Yes! Kinda.
- Oh, G-- No, no.

52:38.450 --> 52:39.867
It's not your fault.

52:39.868 --> 52:41.328
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

52:41.995 --> 52:42.995
Just sit.

52:42.996 --> 52:44.164
We can just sit.

52:44.706 --> 52:45.791
I'll be here.

52:46.792 --> 52:48.544
It's just been a long time.

52:51.672 --> 52:52.881
I know.

52:57.135 --> 52:59.179
You really are here, aren't you?

53:03.308 --> 53:04.351
Yeah.

53:06.520 --> 53:07.563
Yeah, I am.
