WEBVTT

00:51.009 --> 00:53.469
Let go of me!

00:54.680 --> 00:58.975
Okay, now I really have a wedgie.
Fred ! Velma!

00:59.143 --> 01:02.603
Can you guys hurry it up?
This ghost keeps grabbing--

01:04.440 --> 01:06.149
Please!

01:06.316 --> 01:07.525
Jinkies.

01:07.985 --> 01:10.611
Fred. Come in, Fred.

01:10.821 --> 01:14.157
-Fred! Can you hear me?
-Fredster here, Velms.

01:14.491 --> 01:18.161
Shockingly, Daphne's been
captured again. That's okay.

01:18.328 --> 01:20.955
When the Luna Ghost
rounds the corner with Daphne. . .

01:21.123 --> 01:23.833
. . .Shaggy and Scooby will pop out
of the barrel--

01:24.001 --> 01:27.336
You'll activate the conveyor belt,
spilling the oil onto the floor.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.174
Just remember my plan.

01:31.675 --> 01:34.594
Like, chill out, Scooby-Doo.
Stop shaking.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.679
Me? That's you.

01:36.847 --> 01:39.515
Right. It's me. Sorry.

01:53.697 --> 01:57.033
Scooby-Doo, what are you doing, man?

01:57.242 --> 02:00.328
Like, this is no time to. . . .

02:02.164 --> 02:03.372
Oh, boy.

02:03.540 --> 02:07.043
Like, there's a ghost right behind me,
isn't there?

02:11.882 --> 02:12.924
Run !

02:20.516 --> 02:22.642
Go, Shaggy! Go!

02:22.851 --> 02:26.395
-Run !
-Like, I'm trying, buddy!

02:28.649 --> 02:30.483
Fred, now!

02:30.651 --> 02:31.859
Hurry up!

02:32.820 --> 02:34.362
-I got him.
-Look out!

02:35.447 --> 02:37.031
Sorry!

02:50.921 --> 02:53.840
-Sorry, Velma.
-I know, Fred.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.676
-Where's the ghost?
-He's right behind us.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.511
Skateboard !

03:14.611 --> 03:16.487
Is he still after us, Scoob?

03:18.448 --> 03:19.615
Banzai !

03:25.289 --> 03:29.292
-Zoinks! Grab the hook!
-Hold on, Shaggy!

03:45.726 --> 03:48.686
Daphne, are you okay?

03:49.646 --> 03:53.065
I'm so over this
damsel-in-distress nonsense.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.276
Where's Shagster?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.738
-Like, I'm right here, man.
-Me too.

03:58.906 --> 04:03.492
Scoob, that was fun. Let's grab
another skateboard and do it again.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.202
Yeah.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.765
There you go.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.475
One for you.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.854
Good-looking guy.
All right, nice to see you.

04:32.064 --> 04:35.441
-Thanks for saving the factory.
-Pam, any comments?

04:35.651 --> 04:40.821
This is a victory for any celebrity who
wants to make a quality action figure.

04:40.989 --> 04:44.116
-What's the secret of your success?
-Teamwork.

04:44.284 --> 04:49.246
I do a tremendous amount of teamwork,
and I always have a plan. Come on.

04:49.456 --> 04:51.332
Yeah, my plan.

04:51.541 --> 04:56.754
I knew from the start there was no
phantom. The Luna Ghost is, in fact. . . .

04:59.925 --> 05:03.094
-Old Man Smithers?
-The creepy janitor?

05:03.303 --> 05:05.596
He wanted revenge after you
refused to go out with him.

05:05.806 --> 05:10.559
How could you, Pam? I am a lover-boy
of George Clooney-an proportions.

05:11.144 --> 05:16.148
-Fred, how was the ghost able to fly?
-I can answer that. Watch.

05:19.111 --> 05:23.572
These balloons fill with a highly
potent helium synthesis. . .

05:23.740 --> 05:25.741
. . .giving the Luna Ghost. . .

05:26.576 --> 05:29.412
. . . his weightless appearance.

05:30.330 --> 05:34.750
I would have gotten away with it too,
if it weren't for you meddling kids. . .

05:34.918 --> 05:38.546
. . .and your dumb dog !
I'll get you for this!

05:38.755 --> 05:41.090
Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

05:43.260 --> 05:44.927
All right, I'm on it, dude.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.846
-Are you set?
-I'm ready.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.224
Fred, I can't believe you took credit
for my plan again.

05:50.434 --> 05:53.936
Some plan. That ghost pawed me
for an hour and a half.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.522
It's not our fault you always
get kidnapped.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.568
I don't always get kidnapped.
Can't believe you'd say that.

06:00.736 --> 06:03.988
Oh, please.
You come with your own ransom note.

06:05.741 --> 06:08.075
-My glasses!
-Who's helpless now?

06:08.285 --> 06:11.037
I'm going to kill you, Daphne!

06:11.705 --> 06:13.122
Watch the ascot!

06:13.290 --> 06:17.710
You guys, look, I know I'm just
the dude that carries the bags. . .

06:17.878 --> 06:21.255
. . . but we all play an important part
in this group.

06:21.423 --> 06:25.051
I mean, we're just like a big,
delicious banana split.

06:25.218 --> 06:28.054
Fred, you're the big banana.

06:28.805 --> 06:33.309
Daphne, you're the pastrami and
gum-flavored ice cream. And Velma. . .

06:33.477 --> 06:37.772
. . .you're the sweet-and-sour mustard
sauce that goes on top.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.816
That sounds pretty good, doesn't it?

06:41.068 --> 06:45.821
You know what, Shaggy? You've really
put it in perspective for me.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.323
Thanks.

06:48.408 --> 06:49.742
I quit.

06:51.369 --> 06:54.080
-No.
-No way.

06:54.289 --> 06:58.501
You can't quit. I was gonna quit in,
like, two seconds.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.296
Now everyone will think
I copied off the smart girl.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.131
Now, wait a minute.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.843
Maybe I quit.

07:10.472 --> 07:13.557
I do. Yeah, I quit.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.186
I'm out of here.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.022
Good riddance.

07:20.232 --> 07:22.233
Don't--
No. Don't go.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.860
Come on, you guys, don't do this.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.072
Please don't go.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.785
Do I quit?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.287
No, Scoob. . .

07:35.455 --> 07:37.790
. . .friends don't quit.

07:40.168 --> 07:43.420
It looks like it's just you
and me for a while.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.381
What now, Shaggy?

07:45.549 --> 07:50.219
I guess we'll all just do
what we do best, Scoob.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.397
This is primo.

08:01.565 --> 08:05.651
Man, talk about toasted.

08:06.153 --> 08:10.239
Man, the only thing I like better
than an eggplant burger. . .

08:10.448 --> 08:14.368
. . . is a chocolate-covered
eggplant burger.

08:14.578 --> 08:16.912
With hot sauce.

08:19.040 --> 08:23.836
Yeah, just another beautiful day
in paradise.

08:24.629 --> 08:28.382
I'm looking for a "Mr. Rogers"
and a "Mr. Doo." The detectives?

08:28.592 --> 08:32.136
It's probably somebody looking for us
to solve some scary mystery.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.387
Nobody home!

08:33.597 --> 08:36.515
Quick, Scoob-o, grab the food-o,
let's scram-o.

08:36.850 --> 08:40.477
I'm looking for a "Mr. Rogers"
and a "Mr. Doo."

08:44.149 --> 08:45.149
Let's go!

08:47.235 --> 08:53.365
I'm sorry, dude. I'd love to help you
out. You look like a really nice guy.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.618
We're not detectives anymore.

08:55.785 --> 08:59.246
I've been sent by Mr. Emile
Mondevarious to invite you. . .

08:59.456 --> 09:01.832
. . .to his amusement park,
Spooky Island.

09:02.042 --> 09:06.378
We don't go near places with "spooky,"
"haunted," or "creepy" in the name.

09:06.588 --> 09:10.841
-Or hydrocolonic.
-Right, but that's for another reason.

09:11.176 --> 09:16.722
But he'd like you to solve a mystery.
He'll pay you a fee of $1 0,000.

09:16.932 --> 09:20.559
It's just, materialism
is not really our bag, man.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.561
-Free airfare.
-No, thanks.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.314
-Room and board.
-No, thanks.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.483
And all you can eat.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.861
All you can eat?

09:45.835 --> 09:47.169
Fred?

09:47.379 --> 09:51.340
Velma? Are you going this way?

09:56.346 --> 09:58.389
-How have you. . .?
-Been?

09:58.598 --> 10:01.100
-Yes.
-Great.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.228
I'm on the lecture circuit
with my new book. . .

10:04.729 --> 10:09.441
-. . .Fred on Fred: The Many Faces of Me.
-Jinkies, that's impressive.

10:10.652 --> 10:11.777
And yourself?

10:11.945 --> 10:16.448
I've been working at NASA, developing
hydropowered missile defense systems.

10:16.658 --> 10:17.908
But, more importantly. . .

10:18.118 --> 10:20.703
-. . . I'm on a journey of self-discovery.
-NASA?

10:20.870 --> 10:25.207
Charter service to Spooky lsland
will begin boarding momentarily.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.335
What do you mean I can't have
seven carry-on bags?

10:28.545 --> 10:31.547
-That's so economy.
-Crap.

10:32.882 --> 10:37.511
Oh, no. I'm not talking to you guys.

10:41.057 --> 10:43.559
-What are you doing here?
-Isn't it obvious?

10:43.768 --> 10:47.479
We all received the same letter
from one Emile Mondevarious. . .

10:47.689 --> 10:49.606
. . .the reclusive owner
of Spooky Island.

10:49.816 --> 10:54.028
It's not fair. I was gonna solve
the mystery all by myself.

10:54.237 --> 10:57.031
-And when you get caught?
-I'm a black belt now.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.617
I've transformed my body
into a dangerous weapon.

11:02.912 --> 11:03.912
It's true.

11:04.080 --> 11:08.500
Far out. I guess we're, like,
all going to Spooky Island, man.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.169
Where's Scooby?

11:16.760 --> 11:18.302
Hello.

11:19.346 --> 11:21.055
Sorry.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.974
They don't allow big dogs
on the plane.

11:27.979 --> 11:29.980
You've got to be kidding.

11:30.148 --> 11:33.192
No one is stupid enough
to believe that.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.778
Who's the ugly old broad?

11:37.781 --> 11:39.698
-Say hello to Grandma.
-Aloha.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.701
Flight 3774 to Spooky Island,
now boarding.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.621
I wouldn't have agreed
to come if I knew.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.791
Wait, just think about it
for one minute.

11:48.958 --> 11:53.670
Mystery Inc. reunites. We'll be
a team again, just like the old days.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.047
So come on. . .

11:55.256 --> 12:00.552
. . . let's do that thing where we all put
our hands in, lift them up, and go:

12:01.971 --> 12:04.932
Only if Fred and Velma do it.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.061
People are watching, Shag.

12:19.489 --> 12:22.950
Yeah, Scoob, "roo-hoo."
Come on, buddy.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.390
Now that is a beautiful work of art.

13:04.701 --> 13:08.412
Would you mind me taking a seat
there next to. . .?

13:08.621 --> 13:13.167
To my grandma. That's my grandma.
Hi, Grandma. Like, no.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.714
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.050
Bless you.

13:23.553 --> 13:29.683
I'm sorry. My allergies.
It's usually only dogs that do it.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.730
-Maybe I'd better move.
-No, wait.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.400
It's probably just
my grandma's perfume.

13:38.568 --> 13:43.572
Yeah, even I sometimes get
a little allergic, you know. Oh, jeez.

13:44.657 --> 13:48.994
I'm pretty sure Grandma wants to go
back and visit with her pal Velma.

13:49.204 --> 13:50.829
Right, Grandma?

13:51.039 --> 13:52.664
Okay.

13:58.254 --> 14:02.758
Boy, oh, boy, those sure do look
like Scooby Snacks.

14:03.051 --> 14:04.968
I know they're for dogs. . .

14:05.178 --> 14:08.514
. . . but they're 1 00% vegetarian,
and I love them.

14:08.723 --> 14:09.890
Like, me too.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.894
Far out. I've never met another person
who loves Scooby Snacks.

14:14.103 --> 14:16.271
-Me neither.
-I'm Mary Jane.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.400
-Like, that's my favorite name.
-Really?

14:20.610 --> 14:22.611
No way.

14:27.492 --> 14:28.867
Hello.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.588
Grandma?

14:41.798 --> 14:44.883
Velma, it's simple
behavior modification.

14:45.093 --> 14:50.305
To cause a dog to discontinue any
action, flick it on the nose. Observe.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.099
Scoob?

14:54.269 --> 14:55.477
See?

14:59.941 --> 15:05.612
Sit, Grandma! Bad, Grandma!
Don't eat the kitty!

15:11.828 --> 15:14.162
Welcome to Spooky lsland...

15:14.330 --> 15:18.917
...the frightfully popular spring break
spot for college students.

15:19.127 --> 15:23.714
Catch our Electrical Torture Parade.
lt's a Dead World After All.

15:23.923 --> 15:27.801
And the world famous Splatterhorn.

15:28.553 --> 15:32.389
Scooby-Doo!
And the rest of Mystery lnc.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.475
lt's marvelous to see you!
How fanta--

15:35.685 --> 15:38.562
l'm sorry.
That's the second time this week.

15:40.732 --> 15:41.940
Thank goodness.

15:42.150 --> 15:46.236
It's a new toy.
I'm just getting up to speed with it.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.614
-Welcome.
-Thank goodness.

15:48.906 --> 15:51.825
I was afraid I'd have
to lug those to the hotel.

15:51.993 --> 15:56.246
That's what Spooky Island's about,
realizing your worst fears.

15:56.664 --> 16:01.376
I'm Emile Mondevarious,
the owner of this amusement park.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.754
-You seem less. . . .
-Spooky.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.214
--than we'd have guessed.

16:06.424 --> 16:09.801
I can be pretty spooky
when called upon. I can go:

16:12.180 --> 16:14.389
Claws and everything.

16:15.183 --> 16:18.226
You wouldn't want to run into me
in a dark alley.

16:18.436 --> 16:21.730
-So you're the one who brought us here?
-No.

16:21.898 --> 16:25.400
What brought you here
was your insatiable appetite. . .

16:25.610 --> 16:27.444
. . .for a juicy mystery.

16:28.363 --> 16:31.531
The truth is,
Mystery Inc. is broken up.

16:31.741 --> 16:34.284
That's the beauty of something broken.

16:34.452 --> 16:37.371
It can be fixed.
Therein lies its potential.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.290
And I need you to fix Spooky Island.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.875
What's the problem?

16:42.043 --> 16:45.587
I believe somebody's casting a spell
on the students.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.132
Now listen and look around.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.969
Notice any difference between those
arriving and those departing?

16:53.429 --> 16:56.056
They look like sober, well-behaved
college kids.

16:56.224 --> 16:59.017
Precisely.
They didn't before they came.

16:59.185 --> 17:02.854
They've changed.
In other words, a magic spell.

17:03.064 --> 17:06.358
Carol ! Carol, how was the island?

17:06.567 --> 17:08.777
Are you tricking on me?

17:10.196 --> 17:14.366
It's me, Brad. We've known each other
since we were 3.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.952
Back off my grill, son !

17:17.161 --> 17:19.454
Carol, what are you doing?

17:31.008 --> 17:34.720
I'm terrified. The young people
that come off that barge. . .

17:34.929 --> 17:39.641
. . .the people I love the most,
they're in danger.

17:39.851 --> 17:44.146
-I'm going to solve this one first.
-Not before I solve it first.

17:44.355 --> 17:48.817
You'll look like total idiots
when you're captured and I save you.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.610
Thank you. Marvelous.

17:50.778 --> 17:55.323
Maybe we can celebrate later
by having a little spookapalooza.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.784
Spookapalooza?

18:00.621 --> 18:05.333
You haven't noticed anything unusual
since you started working here?

18:05.877 --> 18:10.172
-Any weirdoes running around?
-No.

18:28.983 --> 18:32.110
Welcome, dear victims.

18:32.320 --> 18:36.198
My name is N' Goo Tuana.

18:36.407 --> 18:40.869
This is my evil best pal, Zarkos.

18:41.037 --> 18:45.916
You may recognize him from Telemundo
as the famous masked wrestler. . .

18:46.125 --> 18:47.375
. . .Zarkos.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.920
This enchanted island. . .

18:50.129 --> 18:54.299
. . . is a thoroughfare
to the supernatural realm.

18:54.509 --> 18:59.930
For centuries, it was home to creatures
who lived on the island undisturbed.

19:02.892 --> 19:04.726
But then. . .

19:04.894 --> 19:06.812
. . .ten years ago. . .

19:07.021 --> 19:10.607
. . . Emile Mondevarious. . .

19:10.817 --> 19:16.571
. . .antagonized these ancient beings
by building a theme park here.

19:19.575 --> 19:22.285
The creatures are furious, my friends.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.122
And I assure you. . .

19:26.332 --> 19:28.792
. . .while you party. . .

19:29.001 --> 19:30.919
. . .they plot. . .

19:31.087 --> 19:34.464
. . .their revenge!

19:41.180 --> 19:44.182
Do my friends frighten you?

19:46.936 --> 19:51.565
They would, if it weren't
for the holographic projectors. . .

19:51.732 --> 19:55.944
. . .there, and there and there.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.073
What a smart little one.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.629
Hello, Dead Mike's.

20:16.966 --> 20:18.967
We got a "Mr. Doo" here?

20:19.135 --> 20:21.803
I got a call for a "Mr. Doo."

20:22.471 --> 20:23.889
Melvin Doo?

20:24.098 --> 20:26.516
No, Scooby.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.187
-Hello?
-Got a bag...

20:31.981 --> 20:34.858
...of hamburgers here for you.

20:35.067 --> 20:38.737
Just walk into the dark,
shadowy part of the forest...

20:38.946 --> 20:41.489
...where no one can see you.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.158
Okay.

20:47.330 --> 20:50.165
-Want a stuffed thingy?
-Nobody can win those.

20:50.333 --> 20:55.003
Fred says it's a worthless talent, that
I should've learned French instead.

20:55.171 --> 20:59.341
I say you don't need to know what
" Voulez-vous coucher avec moi" means. . .

20:59.508 --> 21:01.885
. . .to love that song.

21:02.094 --> 21:07.182
I think being good at crane machine
is way cooler than French.

21:08.392 --> 21:09.768
Voilà.

21:10.394 --> 21:15.231
Nobody's ever given me a stuffed
dismembered head before.

21:42.760 --> 21:44.052
Excuse me.

21:45.179 --> 21:48.598
Now I have to start my voodoo ritual
all over again !

21:48.808 --> 21:49.933
Voodoo ritual?

21:50.142 --> 21:54.562
-I was about to sacrifice this chicken.
-That chicken's not alive.

21:54.730 --> 21:59.109
I know. What, did you figure that out
when you saw it didn't have a head?

21:59.318 --> 22:02.612
What do you want?
Why you in the voodoo ritual space?

22:02.822 --> 22:07.909
I'm looking for clues as to who's
behind the students' strange behavior.

22:08.452 --> 22:11.246
Here's a clue:
Purple is a fall color.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.790
-It's the middle of May!
-Pardon?

22:14.000 --> 22:17.085
Do yourself a favor
and get off this island. Go home.

22:17.294 --> 22:21.256
Go home before evil befalls
your skinny, aerobicized booty.

22:21.465 --> 22:23.299
And whatever you do. . .

22:23.509 --> 22:25.635
. . .do not, I repeat. . .

22:25.803 --> 22:29.848
. . .do not go into
that Spooky Island castle.

22:30.016 --> 22:34.853
-You want me to go to that castle.
-Didn't you hear what I said?

22:35.062 --> 22:38.398
You knew I'd do the opposite
of what you said.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.693
You told me not to go to the castle
so I would go. . .

22:41.861 --> 22:44.738
. . .where you set a trap to capture me.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.281
Unless. . .

22:46.490 --> 22:50.118
. . .you knew I'd figure it out,
so you told me not to go. . .

22:50.327 --> 22:54.289
. . .so I'd think you wanted me to go,
so I wouldn't go.

22:54.790 --> 22:59.044
I'll find out what you're hiding
in that castle. You watch.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.463
What in the world?

23:03.924 --> 23:07.552
Hamburgers, where are you?

23:17.980 --> 23:20.482
Hamburgers.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.985
Thank you.

23:47.176 --> 23:48.843
Shaggy!

24:10.741 --> 24:12.534
It's been really nice.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.787
Shaggy!

24:16.956 --> 24:19.249
Monster! Monster!

24:19.458 --> 24:21.042
A monster?

24:26.757 --> 24:29.551
Scooby-Doo, quit goofing around, man.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.220
I guess I should go.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.267
Bye, Scooby.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.230
Bless you.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.736
Shaggy. Scooby.

24:55.119 --> 24:56.244
No way.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.915
-Scoob and me don't do castles.
-Why not?

25:01.125 --> 25:06.212
They have paintings that watch you,
suits of armor you think is a statue. . .

25:06.422 --> 25:11.134
. . . but there's a guy inside who follows
you every time you turn around.

25:11.343 --> 25:15.054
-How many times did that happen?
-Twelve. We're not gonna do it.

25:15.264 --> 25:17.056
That's right.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.100
Scooby?

25:21.687 --> 25:23.646
Did you hurt your paw?

25:23.939 --> 25:27.984
-Would you do it for a Scooby Snack?
-Oh, boy!

25:29.278 --> 25:32.655
-And you'll be fearless?
-Fearless?

25:38.370 --> 25:41.372
Hong Kong Phooey,
watch the fists of fury.

25:41.582 --> 25:42.957
Here you go.

25:44.001 --> 25:45.043
Thank you.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.630
There's plenty more where that came
from. Let's go before someone sees.

25:48.797 --> 25:50.048
Okay.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.802
You're not gonna stay out here alone,
are you?

25:55.346 --> 25:56.721
No, thank you.

26:07.483 --> 26:09.150
Oh, boy.

26:11.195 --> 26:14.489
This place is, like, uber creepy.

26:14.657 --> 26:16.824
Yeah, uber creepy.

26:17.034 --> 26:20.245
The only thing missing
is a mindless zombie.

26:25.000 --> 26:29.712
Fred, get back. I found this place.
I call dibs on its clues.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.715
-I've already found some clues.
-What?

26:33.300 --> 26:37.345
I followed some weird footprints here.
It might be dangerous for you.

26:37.513 --> 26:42.392
If anyone messes with me, I'll open
a can of Chinese whoop-ass on them.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.354
Velma.

26:46.522 --> 26:50.817
-What are you doing here?
-This ride was closed for construction.

26:51.026 --> 26:56.906
It's the most likely place to hatch
a plan. And I wanted to scare Daphne.

26:57.074 --> 27:01.619
Since we're all together,
let's split up and look for more clues.

27:01.829 --> 27:03.871
-Daphne, you and I--
-Typical.

27:04.039 --> 27:06.291
-What?
-Nothing.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.961
-I was always picked last for the teams.
-Okay.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.880
Daphne, exit through the entrance.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.842
Velma and I will enter
through the exit.

27:16.051 --> 27:18.720
And Shaggy and Scooby. . .

27:19.680 --> 27:22.223
. . .do whatever you guys do.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.825
Look at this, huh, Scoob?

27:41.035 --> 27:43.411
It's like a medieval Sizzler.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.955
Pinch me, I'm in heaven--

27:46.165 --> 27:49.625
-It's an expression, Scoob.
-Sorry.

28:06.226 --> 28:10.021
Velma, I never meant to--
Well, you know. . .

28:10.230 --> 28:12.940
-. . . pick you last.
-Don't worry about it.

28:13.484 --> 28:14.609
I know you.

28:15.069 --> 28:17.945
All you care about
are swimsuit models.

28:18.155 --> 28:23.534
Look, I'm a man of substance.
Dorky chicks like you turn me on too.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.957
That's a compliment.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.904
Yes! Yes!

29:00.072 --> 29:01.823
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

29:02.699 --> 29:05.076
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, no!

29:07.496 --> 29:09.664
And now for our dinner show.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.416
What?

29:18.674 --> 29:20.341
Watch out!

29:24.304 --> 29:26.931
-I got a bad feeling about this.
-Me too.

29:27.141 --> 29:29.767
And now for the main course:

29:30.686 --> 29:32.353
You!

29:33.939 --> 29:36.524
Feast on this.

29:45.868 --> 29:47.410
Jinkies.

29:47.703 --> 29:51.164
They're moving toward us. Run !

29:52.749 --> 29:55.626
-We're trapped.
-Quick, try the bookcase.

29:55.836 --> 29:59.547
-One of these has to open a passageway.
-Velma, this is a ride.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.549
You got a better plan?

30:06.930 --> 30:08.347
What do we do?

30:08.515 --> 30:11.726
Do what we do best, Scoob:
Eat.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.397
It's plastic.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.941
So what? You drink out of a toilet.

30:19.902 --> 30:21.694
So do you.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.739
I'm not helpless.

30:24.907 --> 30:27.408
I am helpless. I'm gonna die!

30:47.554 --> 30:50.765
We made it, Scoob. We're alive!

30:55.562 --> 30:56.938
That was weird.

30:57.564 --> 31:00.858
Fred? Freddy?

31:01.568 --> 31:03.069
Are you all right?

31:14.831 --> 31:16.749
The last book.

31:19.962 --> 31:22.171
I don't feel so good.

31:22.339 --> 31:26.008
Reminds me of the time we tried to eat
that guy in the hot-dog costume.

31:26.927 --> 31:29.262
Looks like some kind of school.

31:29.513 --> 31:32.348
In a spooky castle ride? Fishy.

31:54.621 --> 31:57.081
Welcome to America.

31:57.249 --> 32:00.001
l am using the language English.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.670
-Shaggy, look.
-Let's check it out.

32:07.843 --> 32:12.597
Oh, boy. Lights, camera, action,
huh, Scoob?

32:12.764 --> 32:15.016
Now that you're a young adult...

32:15.183 --> 32:18.102
...you'll need to learn societal dos...

32:18.353 --> 32:20.104
...and don'ts.

32:20.522 --> 32:25.526
lnteraction between young
people is polite and casual.

32:29.573 --> 32:30.865
Hey, sorry, bro.

32:31.116 --> 32:34.118
l will crush your bones into dust.

32:37.122 --> 32:40.916
Let's see how the situation
should be handled.

32:41.251 --> 32:47.006
Remember, today's young people
have a language all their own.

32:49.426 --> 32:50.885
Sorry, bro.

32:51.345 --> 32:54.221
No big whoop, dog.
Catch that new vid on the box?

32:54.389 --> 32:57.475
True dat. l'm up to sniznuff
on all popular trends.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.060
Word.

33:00.520 --> 33:03.939
It seems to be a brainwashing
facility of some type.

33:04.107 --> 33:09.236
Wherever there's a brainwashing cult,
there's always a power-hungry leader.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.947
-The Papa Smurf figure.
-Mondevarious.

33:12.699 --> 33:15.242
Then why would he have
invited us here?

34:04.292 --> 34:05.960
Jellybeans.

34:09.548 --> 34:12.174
I'll have whatever he's having.

34:17.222 --> 34:19.557
Are you challenging me?

34:20.976 --> 34:22.810
Maybe.

34:33.321 --> 34:36.073
Pull my finger. Too late.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.915
-You're in trouble.
-Oh, boy.

34:58.346 --> 35:01.766
I'm not stopping
till your fur is singed off.

35:11.067 --> 35:14.278
We're here to solve a mystery.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.821
Yeah, Scoob.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.162
Let's get out of here.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.248
Zoinks! Skedaddle!

35:34.841 --> 35:36.842
-I found a neat and scary clue.
-Us too.

35:37.052 --> 35:39.804
This is a brainwashing
facility for an evil cult.

35:39.971 --> 35:43.224
Maybe this is the secret relic
thingy they worship.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.769
We'll all be relics if we don't
get out of here.

35:46.937 --> 35:48.354
I got a plan.

35:48.772 --> 35:52.024
What's that smell?

35:55.779 --> 35:58.864
Sir, they found the Daemon Ritus.

35:59.866 --> 36:02.618
For your sake, they better not
have gone far.

36:04.454 --> 36:07.540
It is time to summon
the big muchachos.

36:09.251 --> 36:10.417
Like, oh, no!

36:38.446 --> 36:42.449
Mystery Inc. You all seem rather
cheery. Good news, I hope?

36:42.868 --> 36:44.285
Mr. Mononucleosis. . . .

36:45.328 --> 36:48.873
-Yes?
-We have hit a clue smorgasbord.

36:49.457 --> 36:53.168
We have three suspects
as to who's behind this evil hooty.

36:53.336 --> 36:57.047
N' Goo Tuana. He believes
your park's on enchanted ground.

36:57.215 --> 37:01.051
The voodoo man, who tricked me
into going to the castle.

37:01.303 --> 37:03.137
-And you.
-Me?

37:03.305 --> 37:06.056
Let's split up.
We'll meet in a half-hour.

37:06.266 --> 37:09.476
I'll interview employees to see
if they've noticed anything odd.

37:09.644 --> 37:12.688
I'll translate these inscriptions
Daphne found.

37:12.856 --> 37:15.274
I'll go research cults on the Net.

37:18.695 --> 37:20.404
I'm a suspect?

37:20.572 --> 37:24.283
Don't take it personally.
It's mostly just because you creep me out.

37:24.784 --> 37:26.452
I see.

37:27.704 --> 37:28.704
Fine.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.724
Jinkies.

38:08.328 --> 38:11.830
Hey. Your friends ditch you?

38:11.998 --> 38:15.125
No, I always did the brainwork.

38:16.086 --> 38:17.586
What's this?

38:18.004 --> 38:20.255
I believe it's called
the Daemon Ritus.

38:20.423 --> 38:23.008
Daemon Ritus? What's it for?

38:23.218 --> 38:26.136
This describes
an old race of creatures.

38:26.304 --> 38:31.350
It's reminiscent of Pandaemonous texts,
so I can make some of it out.

38:31.518 --> 38:35.854
It looks like instructions
to some sort of secret ritual.

38:36.022 --> 38:37.690
It is fascinating.

38:37.857 --> 38:39.692
On the house. Nice sweater.

38:39.859 --> 38:42.194
You really dig doing this, huh?

38:42.362 --> 38:44.405
Like, clues and stuff.

38:45.365 --> 38:46.490
Certainly.

38:46.658 --> 38:50.369
Really focusing on a mystery
reminds me of the old days.

38:52.539 --> 38:54.623
We were quite a crew back then.

38:55.375 --> 38:58.043
That was the best time of my life.

38:58.211 --> 39:02.297
Shaggy and Scooby....
What goofballs!

39:02.465 --> 39:04.466
Kind of like they are today.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.469
And Daphne....

39:07.637 --> 39:12.391
So beautiful. She was the coolest girl
at Coolsville High.

39:12.559 --> 39:15.561
Fred. He was so handsome.

39:15.729 --> 39:18.313
And he really knew how to accessorize.

39:18.648 --> 39:20.107
Sounds perfect.

39:20.275 --> 39:23.610
Yeah, but every family has one nut.

39:23.778 --> 39:26.155
Scrappy-Dappy-Doo!

39:26.448 --> 39:28.866
Ghosts don't stand a chance with me.

39:29.034 --> 39:32.202
Let me at 'em. I'll rack 'em.
I'll sock 'em.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.706
For the thousandth time,
there's no such thing as ghosts.

39:35.874 --> 39:42.171
Sure there are. When I find them,
I'll give them a dose of puppy power!

39:43.214 --> 39:46.008
Oh, God. He's peeing on me.

39:52.057 --> 39:54.850
That little egomaniac
had flipped his lid.

39:55.018 --> 39:57.978
Scrappy, I told you,
no urinating on Daphne.

39:58.146 --> 40:00.773
-It was an accident.
-You were marking your territory.

40:00.940 --> 40:05.152
You don't have the scrote for this job.
Listen up, losers.

40:05.320 --> 40:09.031
The time has come to appoint me
your unquestioned leader.

40:09.199 --> 40:12.701
Either that, or I'm out of here.

40:15.371 --> 40:20.292
What's the idea? You can't do
this to me. People adore me.

40:20.835 --> 40:24.588
I'm as cute as a Powerpuff Girl.
I'll get my own show.

40:26.049 --> 40:27.883
Puppy power, huh?

40:28.176 --> 40:32.471
And he wasn't even a puppy.
He had a gland disorder.

40:46.903 --> 40:50.531
Help me! Help me!
Monsters! Monsters!

40:57.497 --> 41:00.666
This is the most embarrassing thing
you've done. . .

41:00.834 --> 41:05.170
. . .since you cleaned your beans
at Don Knotts' Christmas party.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.464
How many times
do I have to tell you?

41:07.632 --> 41:12.719
There are no such things as ghouls,
ghosts, goblins or monsters.

41:13.054 --> 41:15.764
Now listen up. There is absolutely. . .

41:15.932 --> 41:20.310
. . .absolutely no such thing as--

41:23.231 --> 41:24.898
Monster!

41:28.862 --> 41:30.404
Fred !

41:32.574 --> 41:34.074
Scooby. . . .

41:35.410 --> 41:37.744
Save Daphne.

41:43.376 --> 41:44.877
My glasses.

41:45.086 --> 41:47.754
I can't find my glasses.

41:50.091 --> 41:53.010
Help me find my glasses.

41:54.679 --> 41:56.597
Here they are.

41:57.473 --> 41:59.057
Thank you.

42:00.059 --> 42:01.101
Nice mask.

42:01.603 --> 42:03.562
Bad breath.

42:07.150 --> 42:08.275
Here.

42:15.241 --> 42:16.825
Jinkies.

42:19.162 --> 42:20.621
Velma!

42:21.539 --> 42:22.539
Come on !

42:28.338 --> 42:29.379
Velma!

42:31.382 --> 42:34.384
This is, like, the opposite
of what I wanted to do today.

42:43.144 --> 42:44.645
Leave it!

42:52.820 --> 42:54.655
Stand back, sir.

42:55.156 --> 42:56.698
I'll protect you.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.289
Mr. Mondevarious!

43:06.167 --> 43:08.001
Daphne, go!

43:10.296 --> 43:13.507
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

43:29.107 --> 43:33.610
Running suitcase.
Run suitcase. Run--

44:01.681 --> 44:03.390
Thank you.

44:04.892 --> 44:07.561
-Where's Scooby?
-I hope he's okay.

44:07.770 --> 44:11.023
-Right here. Scooby-Dooby-Doo!
-Hey, Scoob.

44:20.533 --> 44:22.951
Scooby!

45:03.743 --> 45:08.580
I have a sinking feeling these dudes
aren't brainwashed cult members.

45:08.790 --> 45:13.126
What do they want with the students?
We need to follow them.

45:13.961 --> 45:17.422
-Say what?
-Defeat them and save Fred and Velma.

45:17.632 --> 45:22.969
Sort of like my plan: Get out of here,
let the creatures eat Fred and Velma.

45:23.179 --> 45:26.807
No way. Fred and Velma
always figured out everything.

45:26.974 --> 45:28.642
Now it's our turn.

45:28.810 --> 45:33.480
For the first time, they're
the damsels in distress, not me.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.650
-Help?
-Timber.

45:45.159 --> 45:50.622
-Okay, I'm calling for help.
-No. I got this. I got this.

45:54.419 --> 45:56.169
I don't got this.

46:05.680 --> 46:10.600
-Coast Guard, Fitzgibbon.
-Hello, sir. We're on Spooky Island.

46:10.810 --> 46:12.853
Our friends were. . .

46:13.855 --> 46:16.731
. . . kidnapped.
We need someone here right away.

46:16.941 --> 46:21.528
We do have a unit in the vicinity.
Can you meet them at the pier?

46:21.737 --> 46:24.197
All right, they'll be right there.

46:27.034 --> 46:30.203
"Our friends have been kidnapped."

47:00.693 --> 47:05.405
-Something messed up is happening.
-Is the Coast Guard here?

47:05.615 --> 47:09.201
What happened to the shattered windows
and busted walls?

47:09.410 --> 47:11.244
Yo, Red. The ball.

47:15.124 --> 47:16.833
Let's go.

47:31.682 --> 47:34.434
Anyone else think this is strange?

47:36.103 --> 47:39.064
-Okay, we need to split up.
-Why?

47:39.273 --> 47:42.609
-We need to find Fred and Velma.
-I'll go this way.

47:42.818 --> 47:45.111
And we'll go with you.

47:46.113 --> 47:48.114
Come on, Scoob.

48:23.067 --> 48:24.192
Fred?

48:24.402 --> 48:29.072
Yo, the beyotch was like, "What?"
And I was like, "Later on !"

48:30.992 --> 48:33.535
What up, dog? And. . .

48:33.744 --> 48:37.289
-. . .dog.
-Keeping it real.

48:37.498 --> 48:41.626
-What happened last night?
-We got beats like it was the lizz-nizz.

48:41.836 --> 48:44.754
-You know what I'm saying, G?
-No.

48:46.757 --> 48:48.883
You hear that?

48:56.475 --> 48:58.393
Get the dog.

49:01.522 --> 49:05.025
-Damsel in distress.
-Let go of me. Help!

49:06.861 --> 49:09.946
Hurry, get the door!

49:17.163 --> 49:20.874
-Why is Fred in a bad mood?
-He's not in a bad mood, Scoob. . .

49:21.083 --> 49:23.376
. . . he's a monster.

49:32.720 --> 49:36.389
-Shaggy, bikes!
-I know, "yikes!"

49:36.599 --> 49:38.683
No, bikes!

49:39.018 --> 49:40.518
Scoob!

50:00.206 --> 50:02.290
Shaggy, look out!

50:03.959 --> 50:07.003
I just saw my friend Beth Ann.
Something's wrong with her eyes.

50:07.213 --> 50:09.130
Like, hop on !

50:21.977 --> 50:24.354
Like, what a drag !

50:36.534 --> 50:37.701
Like, duck!

50:59.473 --> 51:01.266
-Yes!
-That was great!

51:01.475 --> 51:05.937
-Are you all right? You were great.
-You too.

51:08.023 --> 51:12.444
-Scooby, what are you doing, man?
-Mary Jane is a man in a mask.

51:12.653 --> 51:15.655
-Mary Jane is a man in a mask?
-Scooby.

51:15.823 --> 51:18.867
What are you doing, man?
Step off, Scoob.

51:19.076 --> 51:21.119
Shaggy, you're whipped.

51:21.328 --> 51:25.123
I'm whipped? Yeah?
Why don't you say that to my face?

51:25.332 --> 51:27.959
Okay, I will.
Your mommy eats cat poop!

51:28.169 --> 51:30.879
No, Scooby-Doo,
your mom eats cat poop!

51:32.757 --> 51:35.842
Bring it.
You want a piece of the Shagster?

51:36.051 --> 51:38.636
-Feel the pain, Scoob.
-Okay.

51:38.846 --> 51:40.889
Come on ! Two shots! Two shots!

51:41.098 --> 51:45.101
Me and you, me and you again.
I'll give you some right now, buddy.

51:48.105 --> 51:49.564
Scoob!

51:50.524 --> 51:54.194
I gotta save him.
You stay here, I'll be right back.

51:54.403 --> 51:56.362
No, Shaggy.

51:56.697 --> 51:59.199
I mean, it's too dangerous.

51:59.408 --> 52:03.495
I've got to. He's, like, my best pal.

52:04.705 --> 52:06.664
Friends don't quit.

52:18.803 --> 52:20.303
Scoob?

52:24.183 --> 52:26.059
Scooby-Doo. . .

52:26.685 --> 52:29.229
. . .where are you?

52:30.231 --> 52:31.940
Scoob?

53:04.765 --> 53:07.725
Shaggy. Shaggy.

53:09.770 --> 53:11.938
Shaggy!

53:14.108 --> 53:15.608
Velma.

53:17.236 --> 53:19.153
I'll save you.

53:26.954 --> 53:30.081
Thanks, Shaggy.
Boy, am I glad to see you.

53:30.291 --> 53:34.085
Let me go so I can return to my body.
Get out of here. . .

53:34.295 --> 53:37.463
. . . before they steal
your protoplasm too.

53:37.798 --> 53:40.717
I always knew you were a hero, Shaggy.

53:42.761 --> 53:44.470
Jinkies!

54:17.296 --> 54:19.464
-Hey, buddy.
-Shaggy!

54:19.673 --> 54:26.179
Someone must have spiked my root beer
last night. Talk me down, man.

54:26.388 --> 54:29.599
Fred, you're a frigging
protoplasmic head.

54:32.019 --> 54:33.561
I know.

54:34.021 --> 54:37.690
But I'm still the best-looking
protoplasmic head here.

54:40.611 --> 54:41.861
How do you drive this?

54:42.071 --> 54:45.907
The Darkopalypse's upon us.
Get what you need for the ceremony.

54:46.116 --> 54:48.743
On your right. Your left.

54:49.787 --> 54:52.205
I'm coming, good-looking !

54:55.584 --> 54:59.879
-Thank you, you've saved me.
-Sorry, I'm looking for my friends.

55:00.047 --> 55:01.464
But--

55:06.428 --> 55:09.722
Put me back, Shaggy.
I'll figure a way out myself.

55:10.182 --> 55:11.933
-Like, how?
-I don't know.

55:12.142 --> 55:16.104
I'll use my tongue as an oar
and swim to the edge.

55:16.313 --> 55:17.647
Sorry.

55:33.288 --> 55:35.665
Yo, yo, you, yo.

55:43.173 --> 55:44.841
What the--?

56:00.691 --> 56:03.401
You could use a little sunlight.

56:16.790 --> 56:19.083
That's one part of the mystery solved.

56:19.293 --> 56:22.837
The creatures need our bodies
to survive in sunlight.

56:23.589 --> 56:25.548
Like a human suit.

56:25.758 --> 56:28.801
SPF 1 ,000,000.

56:29.803 --> 56:33.222
But what are they doing here
in the first place?

56:35.267 --> 56:37.560
Daphne, you okay?

56:38.479 --> 56:39.979
Yeah.

56:40.147 --> 56:43.316
-But I'm not Daphne!
-Fred?

56:49.907 --> 56:53.993
I couldn't get to my body.
I didn't know where else to go.

56:54.161 --> 56:57.455
It's not easy to steer
when you're pure spirit.

57:01.001 --> 57:03.669
I can look at myself naked.

57:03.879 --> 57:05.213
Oh, brother.

57:13.847 --> 57:16.265
-Get your hands off me.
-Daphne?

57:16.475 --> 57:21.062
-He planned this somehow, didn't he?
-Hey, good-looking.

57:22.481 --> 57:24.357
Fred, you egocentric--

57:24.525 --> 57:27.944
-Please tell me you guys are you.
-Fred keeps touching me.

57:28.153 --> 57:31.531
Makes you nostalgic
for the homicidal creatures.

57:31.740 --> 57:34.492
I stole this. I hope it helps.

57:34.701 --> 57:36.953
The Daemon Ritus.

57:43.043 --> 57:46.295
-I'm me again.
-Yippee for you.

57:46.505 --> 57:50.049
Man, like, why am I wearing a dress?

57:50.217 --> 57:54.178
Everyone remain calm.
Velma, what the heck's going on?

57:54.388 --> 57:56.222
If I am correct. . .

57:56.431 --> 58:01.018
. . .due to the instability of protoplasm
in the proximity of the Daemon Ritus. . .

58:01.228 --> 58:05.314
. . .we're going to continue
randomly changing bodies until--

58:06.483 --> 58:07.483
Jinkies!

58:08.944 --> 58:12.113
--until the protoplasm realigns
with the appropriate bodies.

58:12.322 --> 58:14.073
I'm Fred again !

58:14.283 --> 58:18.828
Daph, what's wrong with you?
Don't you ever eat?

58:24.751 --> 58:25.751
I'm me.

58:25.919 --> 58:27.920
-I'm back.
-Like, me too.

58:28.088 --> 58:29.922
Told you so.

58:31.341 --> 58:33.509
-Oh, no.
-Let's go.

58:37.139 --> 58:39.807
I guess that was the wrong ingredient.

58:40.434 --> 58:41.809
Wait.

58:42.352 --> 58:44.604
I know how to handle this guy.

58:44.771 --> 58:47.398
Hey, you ! What're you doing?

58:47.608 --> 58:50.234
Yes. That is masterful.

58:50.444 --> 58:54.780
I'm doing a voodoo ritual.
I need to get the right ingredients.

58:54.948 --> 58:59.160
The only way to protect myself is
by blessing this dead Arnouki beast.

58:59.369 --> 59:03.748
They're about to perform
their evil Darkopalypse ritual.

59:03.957 --> 59:06.125
-Darkopalypse ritual?
-Right.

59:06.335 --> 59:10.004
-That's what the ancient text describes.
-Don't open that!

59:10.214 --> 59:13.925
They use the protoplasm
in the vat as an energy source.

59:14.635 --> 59:19.430
And the leader needs to absorb a purely
good soul to complete the ritual.

59:19.598 --> 59:22.642
Legend has it,
once the ritual is performed. . .

59:22.809 --> 59:26.687
. . .the creatures will rule on Earth
for 1 0,000 years.

59:26.855 --> 59:30.399
That's why I have this in my house.
To protect myself.

59:30.567 --> 59:33.027
You have another one of those?

59:33.195 --> 59:37.657
Those creatures are taking over
the world? That is so mean.

59:37.824 --> 59:42.578
They can't do the ritual without a pure
human soul. Where will they get one?

59:42.746 --> 59:45.915
I didn't say human.

59:46.083 --> 59:47.708
Oh, boy.

1:00:05.560 --> 1:00:08.229
Hello, puppy.

1:00:08.397 --> 1:00:11.691
If the person behind all this
needs Scooby-Doo. . . .

1:00:11.858 --> 1:00:14.986
Then that person is the one
who brought Scooby here.

1:00:19.533 --> 1:00:24.370
Scoobert. How are you, my friend?
Sit down, please.

1:00:24.538 --> 1:00:26.038
Okay.

1:00:28.208 --> 1:00:30.209
Scooby Snack?

1:00:30.377 --> 1:00:32.378
Maybe one.

1:00:36.675 --> 1:00:39.176
We'll need some more of those.

1:00:40.387 --> 1:00:42.596
That's me!

1:00:42.764 --> 1:00:47.184
It certainly is.
And that's because. . .why?

1:00:47.352 --> 1:00:50.855
We love you, Scooby-Doo.

1:00:51.023 --> 1:00:55.067
Unlike that alleged friend
of yours, Shaggy.

1:00:55.902 --> 1:01:01.615
He wouldn't believe you about
that nasty girl Mary Jane, would he?

1:01:02.242 --> 1:01:03.784
No.

1:01:04.578 --> 1:01:07.413
But I believe you, my friend.

1:01:07.581 --> 1:01:12.543
And that's why I've got
a very important job for you.

1:01:12.711 --> 1:01:14.253
What's that?

1:01:14.421 --> 1:01:18.257
That's a cat with a bobbing head.
Please don't touch it.

1:01:18.633 --> 1:01:22.386
Scooby, I would like you. . .

1:01:22.554 --> 1:01:26.599
. . .to be a sacrifice.

1:01:26.767 --> 1:01:29.143
A sacrifice?

1:01:32.814 --> 1:01:36.067
If Mondorajagaga wanted Scooby,
why'd he invite the rest of us?

1:01:36.234 --> 1:01:39.445
It doesn't matter.
We gotta, like, go save Scoob.

1:01:39.613 --> 1:01:43.366
Our area of expertise is nut jobs
in Halloween costumes.

1:01:43.533 --> 1:01:45.701
We're supposed to be heroes, man.

1:01:47.245 --> 1:01:50.498
So I'm gonna do what I always do:

1:01:50.665 --> 1:01:55.419
I'm gonna eat myself a Scooby Snack,
and I'm gonna save my best pal.

1:01:57.589 --> 1:01:59.382
Velmster?

1:01:59.758 --> 1:02:04.845
You think I'm gonna fall for that?
Giving me my own nickname?

1:02:05.430 --> 1:02:08.432
Trying to make me feel like. . .

1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:11.143
. . . part of the gang?

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:15.439
We could make a plan.

1:02:15.607 --> 1:02:19.735
What can I do? The only thing
I'm good for is getting caught.

1:02:19.903 --> 1:02:22.363
But you never let that
stop you before.

1:02:22.531 --> 1:02:26.283
And if that's not a true hero,
then I don't know what is.

1:02:36.378 --> 1:02:39.505
Let's get jinkie with it.

1:03:11.163 --> 1:03:16.000
Okay, so we use the pulleys
to tip over the vat.

1:03:16.168 --> 1:03:19.920
Daphne will open the air vents
and release the disco skull.

1:03:20.088 --> 1:03:22.173
The light will refract off the skull--

1:03:22.340 --> 1:03:27.470
The creatures will explode, I'll find
Scoob, and we'll have saved the world.

1:03:28.388 --> 1:03:31.140
Oh, no. The ritual's beginning.

1:03:31.308 --> 1:03:33.809
Quick. Shaggy, attach this to the vat.

1:03:42.611 --> 1:03:44.778
We're here to save you.

1:03:44.946 --> 1:03:46.572
Shaggy, faster.

1:03:47.032 --> 1:03:48.532
All systems go.

1:03:49.075 --> 1:03:50.576
Wait, no!

1:03:50.744 --> 1:03:52.745
Mystery Inc. rides again.

1:04:22.984 --> 1:04:25.986
Quick, hide the Daemon Ritus.

1:04:37.582 --> 1:04:40.501
Would you like another Scooby Snack?

1:04:41.044 --> 1:04:42.461
Okay.

1:04:42.671 --> 1:04:44.630
Scooby-Doo!

1:06:01.583 --> 1:06:04.918
Yo, yo, yo. Yo, homedogs.

1:06:05.086 --> 1:06:07.421
You forgot the next part
of the dance. . .

1:06:07.589 --> 1:06:10.841
. . .where we do the Electric Slide,
you know. . . .

1:06:21.603 --> 1:06:23.103
Hurry up, Velma.

1:06:23.271 --> 1:06:24.813
Fred, Velma. . .

1:06:24.981 --> 1:06:29.026
. . .welcome to my little
end-of-the-world party.

1:06:29.194 --> 1:06:32.488
I've waited a long time
for this moment.

1:06:32.656 --> 1:06:37.242
Thank you for returning
the ultimate party favor:

1:06:37.410 --> 1:06:40.204
The Daemon Ritus.

1:06:41.998 --> 1:06:46.627
And now, behold the sacrifice.

1:06:48.088 --> 1:06:51.340
Thank you. Thank you.

1:06:51.508 --> 1:06:54.051
Hello, thank you.

1:06:56.096 --> 1:06:58.097
Thank you. Shaggy?

1:06:58.431 --> 1:06:59.932
Scoobert.

1:07:01.309 --> 1:07:04.311
Let's run for it.
We, like, gotta get out of here.

1:07:04.688 --> 1:07:07.481
-I'm a sacrifice. Hello.
-A sacrifice?

1:07:07.649 --> 1:07:09.817
Dude, that's not a good thing, Scoob.

1:07:15.949 --> 1:07:17.783
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1:07:17.951 --> 1:07:22.746
And I'm sorry I haven't been
a very good friend since we got here.

1:07:22.914 --> 1:07:26.041
-But you gotta trust me now.
-You don't trust me.

1:07:26.209 --> 1:07:31.630
I do trust you.
Now, look. Who's your best buddy?

1:07:32.799 --> 1:07:34.216
-Shaggy.
-Right.

1:07:34.384 --> 1:07:36.385
And who's my best buddy?

1:07:36.970 --> 1:07:39.346
-Scooby-Doo?
-That's right.

1:07:39.514 --> 1:07:44.768
You are. And we're like two trippy peas
in a far-out pod, man.

1:07:45.353 --> 1:07:48.731
Best buddies trust each other.
Let's do what we do best.

1:07:48.898 --> 1:07:53.318
Let's run out of here screaming
in fear like two lunatics, okay?

1:07:53.486 --> 1:07:56.530
On the count of--
Let's make it five. One.

1:07:57.574 --> 1:07:59.158
Two.

1:08:06.791 --> 1:08:08.542
Hey, look at me!

1:08:19.929 --> 1:08:22.556
The moment is at hand.

1:08:22.724 --> 1:08:28.187
Through the Daemon Ritus,
I shall absorb the energy source.

1:08:37.071 --> 1:08:41.074
And now, to complete
the transformation. . .

1:08:41.242 --> 1:08:44.036
. . . I shall absorb the pure one.

1:08:44.204 --> 1:08:45.204
Scoob.

1:08:46.498 --> 1:08:50.876
Ultimate power shall be mine!

1:08:51.044 --> 1:08:53.796
Nobody absorbs my pal !

1:09:07.018 --> 1:09:09.102
Come on !

1:09:11.523 --> 1:09:14.066
I'm free!

1:09:15.360 --> 1:09:16.735
Look at me!

1:09:16.903 --> 1:09:18.904
Get him !

1:09:21.407 --> 1:09:23.242
Let's get the Daemon Ritus.

1:09:23.409 --> 1:09:25.786
Get off my pincer!

1:09:33.878 --> 1:09:36.088
Cowabunga!

1:09:41.928 --> 1:09:46.139
Look, Velms. A man in a mask.

1:09:50.937 --> 1:09:55.649
We love you, Scooby-Doo. We love you.

1:09:56.150 --> 1:09:59.486
That alleged friend of yours, Shaggy.

1:09:59.654 --> 1:10:01.405
I shall absorb. . . .

1:10:04.784 --> 1:10:08.829
Puppy power! I've outsmarted--

1:10:11.624 --> 1:10:13.125
Scrappy-Doo.

1:10:13.293 --> 1:10:17.170
Correction.
The new, improved Scrappy.

1:10:17.338 --> 1:10:23.552
Because I, Scrappy-Dappy-Doo,
have absorbed enough energy. . .

1:10:23.720 --> 1:10:29.266
. . .to rule the world
with my all-powerful army!

1:10:30.184 --> 1:10:35.230
And I've brought you here,
puny, pathetic Mystery Inc. . .

1:10:35.398 --> 1:10:39.359
. . .to witness my moment of triumph.

1:10:39.527 --> 1:10:44.489
All I need to complete
my transformation is Scooby-Doo.

1:10:46.159 --> 1:10:49.494
Me? Don't you mean Melvin Doo?

1:10:49.662 --> 1:10:51.204
Seize them !

1:10:51.372 --> 1:10:54.291
Like, let's get out of here!

1:10:55.543 --> 1:10:57.836
Take that, pretty boy!

1:11:14.020 --> 1:11:16.563
This is totally un-groovy, Scoob.

1:11:16.731 --> 1:11:20.776
Scooby-Doo, where are you?

1:11:36.876 --> 1:11:41.380
Yield to my puppy power!

1:11:41.965 --> 1:11:44.549
-We gotta tip over the protoplasm vat.
-How?

1:11:44.717 --> 1:11:47.260
The pincer. Come on.

1:11:52.016 --> 1:11:56.478
You all need to step back,
because Fredster's got his groove on.

1:12:15.248 --> 1:12:19.584
Got you ! You look
so much bigger on TV.

1:12:30.638 --> 1:12:33.223
-Shaggy!
-Scoob.

1:12:33.766 --> 1:12:35.726
You're done!

1:12:45.611 --> 1:12:48.613
Come back here, you lazy beatnik.

1:12:49.323 --> 1:12:50.407
Shaggy.

1:12:55.705 --> 1:12:57.873
-Crud.
-Told you so.

1:13:03.796 --> 1:13:05.964
Like, wow!

1:13:06.340 --> 1:13:08.967
Give me the dog !

1:13:10.094 --> 1:13:13.847
Scrappy, down ! Sit! Bad Scrappy!

1:13:23.149 --> 1:13:27.569
Let's finish this puppy! Now!

1:13:27.737 --> 1:13:29.321
Not again.

1:13:30.031 --> 1:13:32.699
Captured again, señorita?

1:13:32.867 --> 1:13:36.703
Not this time!

1:13:55.014 --> 1:13:57.766
-Now who's the damsel in distress?
-Me?

1:13:58.267 --> 1:13:59.684
Straight up.

1:14:35.972 --> 1:14:39.182
Mystery Inc. , this ain't over!

1:14:39.517 --> 1:14:42.435
Not by a long shot!

1:14:43.646 --> 1:14:47.190
I'll rock you and sock you. . .

1:14:47.358 --> 1:14:49.860
. . .and crush you like--

1:14:50.736 --> 1:14:53.071
-Like, dude?
-What?

1:14:53.239 --> 1:14:56.658
You're a bad puppy!

1:15:10.965 --> 1:15:16.011
Come on, I can still take you.
Put them up, you mangy mutt.

1:15:16.179 --> 1:15:18.722
Is that all you got?

1:15:32.778 --> 1:15:33.862
Hey, Daph !

1:15:35.990 --> 1:15:38.950
-We did it!
-Yes, we did.

1:15:48.961 --> 1:15:51.671
Fred ! Cut it out.

1:16:07.855 --> 1:16:11.024
-Mr. Mondevarious, is that you?
-Yes.

1:16:11.192 --> 1:16:14.236
Oh, thank goodness!
Thank you ! Thank you !

1:16:14.403 --> 1:16:16.529
Velma! Thank you !

1:16:21.661 --> 1:16:24.996
You're fogging up my glasses.

1:16:28.125 --> 1:16:30.460
Two years ago, that little pest. . .

1:16:30.628 --> 1:16:33.797
. . .turns up at a casting session
for our evil elves.

1:16:33.965 --> 1:16:36.174
Next thing I know,
I'm stuck in a hole. . .

1:16:36.342 --> 1:16:40.345
. . .and he's cavorting about
in a mechanical version of me.

1:16:40.513 --> 1:16:44.349
But look, thank you so much.

1:16:45.810 --> 1:16:49.813
What a delight. Fantastic!
Fantastic!

1:16:51.524 --> 1:16:54.276
-Shaggy!
-Scooby-Doo!

1:17:00.366 --> 1:17:02.033
I love you, Shaggy.

1:17:02.201 --> 1:17:04.160
I love you too, Scoob.

1:17:04.328 --> 1:17:07.038
Now get off me, buddy.

1:17:10.835 --> 1:17:14.212
Thanks. You saved my life.

1:17:14.380 --> 1:17:16.548
Like, no problem.

1:17:24.223 --> 1:17:26.683
And thank you, Scooby-Doo.

1:17:27.059 --> 1:17:31.438
-My little schmookem-wookem.
-Shucks.

1:17:56.422 --> 1:18:00.091
Fred, can you tell us
how you solved the case?

1:18:00.259 --> 1:18:04.846
It all started when I was giving
a speech on my new book and. . . .

1:18:08.684 --> 1:18:12.270
And I think the Velmster
should take it from here.

1:18:14.190 --> 1:18:15.774
Go.

1:18:19.528 --> 1:18:23.782
Through the combined
intuitive powers of Mystery Inc. . .

1:18:23.949 --> 1:18:30.288
. . .we've discovered the real villain
is, in fact, Scrappy Cornelius Doo. . .

1:18:30.456 --> 1:18:33.291
. . .who sadly was corrupted
by the power of the Daemon Ritus.

1:18:33.459 --> 1:18:36.711
Get over it!
So I got a little cranky.

1:18:36.879 --> 1:18:41.257
It's no reason to freak out like a jerk
and try to kill all of humanity.

1:18:41.425 --> 1:18:45.053
I would've gotten away with it too,
if not for you meddling sons of--

1:18:45.221 --> 1:18:47.639
Now that Mystery Inc.
is back together. . .

1:18:47.807 --> 1:18:51.059
. . .any comment on the Mud Bog Ghoul
who's been terrorizing London?

1:18:51.227 --> 1:18:53.978
Whatever the case,
Mystery Inc. will be there.

1:18:54.146 --> 1:18:55.647
Solving mysteries, man.

1:18:55.981 --> 1:19:00.193
-Righting wrongs.
-Looking for clues and kicking butt.

1:19:18.170 --> 1:19:20.296
How groovy is this, man?

1:19:20.464 --> 1:19:24.676
Spooky Island finally came through
with its all-you-can-eat deal.

1:19:24.885 --> 1:19:30.348
And there's nobody I'd rather
gorge myself with than you, Scooby-Doo.

1:19:30.516 --> 1:19:33.685
-My best friend.
-You're my best friend, buddy.

1:19:34.019 --> 1:19:38.189
You're beautiful like a beautiful
piece of pizza.

1:19:43.070 --> 1:19:47.115
Zoinks! Them peppers is, like, hot.

1:19:47.575 --> 1:19:50.743
-Wimp.
-Wimp? You think you can handle it?

1:19:50.911 --> 1:19:55.206
Why don't you put your mouth
where your mouth is?

1:19:58.669 --> 1:20:00.170
Okay.

1:20:09.722 --> 1:20:13.808
Scooby-Doo, you feeling okay?

1:20:29.950 --> 1:20:31.493
Here you go, dude.

1:20:40.544 --> 1:20:43.296
-Like, how'd that taste, man?
-Delicious.

1:20:43.464 --> 1:20:45.924
Well, let's get two more.

1:20:51.305 --> 1:20:56.935
On the count of three.
One, two, three!

1:26:31.436 --> 1:26:33.437
