<i>Hop in, pard.</i>

01:18.176 --> 01:19.943
Where you going?

01:19.944 --> 01:22.162
Vegas.

01:22.163 --> 01:23.730
Come on.

01:23.731 --> 01:25.699
This is your lucky day.

01:43.017 --> 01:46.553
You can sit a little bit
closer if you want.

01:47.772 --> 01:49.189
It was a bad idea.

01:49.190 --> 01:52.592
- Chill, okay?
- I'm chilled.

01:52.593 --> 01:55.612
I sure am glad you're gonna
be such good company.

01:55.613 --> 01:57.314
<i>Jesus saves!</i>

01:57.315 --> 01:58.765
I don't like Garth Brooks.

01:58.766 --> 02:00.701
Me neither.

02:00.702 --> 02:04.488
I don't know anybody
that likes him.

02:06.324 --> 02:10.210
You gonna keep that thing
open all the way to Vegas?

02:12.113 --> 02:14.748
You got a name?

02:14.749 --> 02:18.451
Look, I'll just pull over
and you can get out, okay?

02:18.452 --> 02:21.138
I've been driving all the
way from Kansas. I'm tired.

02:21.139 --> 02:24.141
I ain't in the mood to
get myself pig-stuck

02:24.142 --> 02:26.593
for doing somebody
a favor. Okay?

02:26.594 --> 02:28.328
I'll just pull on over.

02:34.802 --> 02:37.104
All right?

02:41.826 --> 02:45.112
So you got a name?

02:45.113 --> 02:46.864
I'm Jeff.

02:46.865 --> 02:49.283
Nomi.

02:49.284 --> 02:51.335
What kind of name's that?

02:51.336 --> 02:53.453
My mom was Italian.

02:53.454 --> 02:55.339
Italian, huh?

02:55.340 --> 02:57.758
You one of those mafia girls?

02:57.759 --> 02:59.960
That why you got your blade?

03:02.163 --> 03:04.932
What are you gonna Vegas
for, you gonna win?

03:04.933 --> 03:08.218
I'm gonna dance.

03:08.219 --> 03:11.504
You gonna be one of them
private escort dancers?

03:11.505 --> 03:15.142
Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

03:20.782 --> 03:24.785
<i>Kid, you never go
to sleep in Vegas.</i>

03:24.786 --> 03:28.188
- There she is.
- You been here before?

03:28.189 --> 03:32.292
Sure. I got an uncle.
He's a host at the riviera.

03:33.211 --> 03:35.796
- You gamble?
- No.

03:35.797 --> 03:39.383
You got to gamble
if you're gonna win.

03:39.384 --> 03:41.835
I'm gonna win.

03:41.836 --> 03:44.638
You can use some of that mafia
money you got in the suitcase.

04:06.778 --> 04:09.997
Just leave your stuff in the car.
I can talk to my uncle,

04:09.998 --> 04:13.200
See if he can
help you get a job.

04:13.201 --> 04:17.087
What, ain't anyone
ever been nice to you?

04:25.046 --> 04:27.047
Want to play a slot machine?

04:27.048 --> 04:29.516
Yeah.

04:29.517 --> 04:32.853
Here's 10 bucks.
You win, we split it up.

04:32.854 --> 04:35.355
No holding out on me either.

04:35.356 --> 04:37.307
I'm gonna go see my uncle.

04:40.044 --> 04:42.179
Meet you right back here.

04:56.260 --> 04:58.979
Holy shit!

04:58.980 --> 05:01.014
Ohh!

05:05.486 --> 05:08.622
Ha ha ha!

05:08.623 --> 05:10.223
Look at you.

05:10.224 --> 05:14.194
- Want to try some silver dollars?
- Sure.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.005
Fuck!

05:25.006 --> 05:27.274
You lose all your money, honey?

05:27.275 --> 05:28.942
You want to make some more?

05:28.943 --> 05:31.578
It won't take you any
longer than 15 minutes.

05:31.579 --> 05:35.115
Sooner or later, you're
gonna have to sell it.

05:41.990 --> 05:45.292
Fuck!

05:52.333 --> 05:54.534
Shit.

05:54.535 --> 05:57.554
Fuck. Fuck!

05:57.555 --> 06:00.474
Fuck the fucker!
Fuck!

That's my car!
I said that's my car.

06:03.461 --> 06:05.028
I want my fucking suitcase!

06:05.029 --> 06:06.697
Get off my car!

06:11.986 --> 06:15.355

So...

06:49.390 --> 06:51.024
What was in your suitcase?

06:51.025 --> 06:53.527
Nothing.
Just my stuff.

06:53.528 --> 06:56.413
Everything I had.

06:56.414 --> 06:58.065
Fuck!

06:58.066 --> 06:59.800

07:03.621 --> 07:05.605
Welcome to Vegas.

07:10.211 --> 07:12.612
You know anybody here?

07:14.415 --> 07:16.683
Got any family you can call?

07:16.684 --> 07:19.536
I don't have any family.

07:21.105 --> 07:23.356
Where are you from?

07:24.492 --> 07:25.992
Back East.

07:25.993 --> 07:27.994
From where back East?

07:29.997 --> 07:32.265
Different places.

07:39.740 --> 07:42.309
Look...

07:42.310 --> 07:46.279
You can stay with me
if you need a place to crash.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.566
<i>It's not much.</i>

07:59.260 --> 08:01.344
No.

08:03.314 --> 08:05.398
You're not a hooker, are you?

08:05.399 --> 08:08.068
No.

No.

They're great.

08:30.892 --> 08:33.376
- They're neat, huh?
- They're neat.

08:33.376 --> 08:35.178
Want to come with me?

08:35.179 --> 08:37.179
We've got this new lead.

08:37.181 --> 08:39.866
She's really good.

08:39.866 --> 08:41.701
I got to go to work.

08:41.702 --> 08:44.838
Jerk, you don't have to be
to work for three hours.

08:44.839 --> 08:48.108
<i>What are you gonna do,
watch tv and eat chips?</i>

08:48.109 --> 08:51.344
Yeah.
Where are the chips?

08:51.345 --> 08:52.729
I don't know.

08:52.730 --> 08:54.865
You ate them, didn't you?

08:54.866 --> 08:56.849
- Mnh-mnh.
- Yes, you did.

08:56.850 --> 08:59.069
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did!

08:59.070 --> 09:00.820
Stop!

09:00.821 --> 09:04.741
Oh, come on, Nomi.
You can show off your nails.

09:04.742 --> 09:07.026
They'll all be so jealous.

09:07.027 --> 09:10.130
- You think?
- I think.

09:10.131 --> 09:12.616
What am I gonna wear?

09:12.617 --> 09:15.385
Wear the dress
that I made last week.

09:15.386 --> 09:17.537
- The fringe one?
- Uh-huh.

09:17.538 --> 09:19.489
I'm gonna put my hair up.

09:19.490 --> 09:21.374
We do not have time for
you to put your hair up.

09:21.375 --> 09:23.760
I'll hurry. I promise!
I promise!

09:23.761 --> 09:26.246
All right, let's go.
Let's do this.

09:26.247 --> 09:28.215
Come on, we got two minutes.

09:28.216 --> 09:30.917
Robes off.
Ladies, how are we doing?

09:30.918 --> 09:32.419
- Annie.
- What?

09:32.420 --> 09:34.221
- You're naked.
- Fuck you!

09:34.222 --> 09:36.656
- What happened?
- I don't know. It just ripped.

09:36.657 --> 09:38.825
It's almost done.

09:38.826 --> 09:42.028
They're gonna a smiling snatch
if you don't fix this g-string.

09:42.029 --> 09:44.064
I'll be right there, Annie.

09:44.065 --> 09:46.066
She wants to smile her snatch.

09:46.067 --> 09:48.001
She probably cut
that string herself.

09:48.002 --> 09:50.170
You're terrible, Julie.
Okay, you're done.

09:50.171 --> 09:52.439
What is that smell?

09:52.440 --> 09:56.309
- It's that damn monkey act. He feeds them garlic.
- It stinks in here.

09:56.310 --> 09:58.578
Do you want me to go
on stage without a g?

09:58.579 --> 10:02.716
I am fixing it right now.
Give me one damn minute. Jesus!

10:02.717 --> 10:06.286
- Who wants to see her snatch anyway?
- I certainly wouldn't.

10:06.287 --> 10:07.938
Nomi, come on.

10:07.939 --> 10:10.924
<i>All right, you guys,
let's line it up.</i>

10:10.925 --> 10:13.092
<i>You got four counts of eight.
Let's go. Line it up.</i>

10:13.093 --> 10:15.895
- Miss Connors.
- Just set them over there.

10:15.896 --> 10:19.032
<i>There!</i> All right,
<i>let's move it!</i>

10:19.033 --> 10:21.635
- Molly, my g!
- Here.

10:21.636 --> 10:24.638
Wouldn't it be great if one of these
nights she fell down the stairs?

10:24.639 --> 10:26.873
Nomi, go up to the show room.
Watch from there.

10:26.874 --> 10:28.825
- Can I go up there?
- Sure.

10:28.826 --> 10:32.111
You guys, you got two counts of eight.
What are you doing?

10:32.112 --> 10:34.464
Brian, move your ass!
Go!

12:24.742 --> 12:26.409
Latoya,

12:26.410 --> 12:28.044
Suzanne, you name it.

12:28.045 --> 12:30.780
We wanted Cristal.

12:30.781 --> 12:34.734
Cristal Connors defines
what Las Vegas is all about.

12:34.735 --> 12:37.103
She's dazzling, she's exciting,

12:37.104 --> 12:38.505
And she's very, very sexy.

12:38.506 --> 12:41.508
How does it feel
to be back in Vegas?

12:41.509 --> 12:44.010
How did you feel
about the show tonight?

12:44.011 --> 12:46.112
It's the best show
I've ever been in.

12:46.113 --> 12:48.948
I only hope
I can do it justice.

12:48.949 --> 12:50.283
You did, and you will.

12:50.284 --> 12:52.285
We're thrilled
to have you here.

12:52.286 --> 12:54.354

12:54.355 --> 12:55.955
You, too, now.

12:55.956 --> 12:58.324
Mr. Karlman,
can we have one of you

12:58.325 --> 12:59.993
handing Cristal the flowers?

12:59.994 --> 13:01.461
Zack.

13:01.462 --> 13:04.063
Zack, you do it.

13:04.064 --> 13:05.782
This is Zack Carey,

13:05.783 --> 13:07.784
The entertainment director
of Stardust hotel.

13:07.785 --> 13:09.869
He's so smooth.

13:09.870 --> 13:13.740
- Your bouquet, Ms. Connors.
- Can I keep them?

13:13.741 --> 13:16.242
Okay, folks, that's it.
Thank you very much for coming.

13:16.243 --> 13:19.446
Thanks a lot.
That's all.

13:22.082 --> 13:23.783
She's great, isn't she?

13:23.784 --> 13:25.468
She doesn't suck.

13:25.469 --> 13:27.137
Molly, we still need you.

13:27.138 --> 13:28.838
Come with me.

13:28.839 --> 13:31.591
You can be my assistant.
Come on.

13:37.798 --> 13:39.599
<i>Yes?</i>

13:41.202 --> 13:43.903
Yes, miss Connors.

13:43.904 --> 13:46.039
Cristal. Please.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.474
And you are?
I'm sorry.

13:47.475 --> 13:49.175
Molly.
Molly Abrams.

13:49.176 --> 13:51.244
Molly, this top is too tight.

13:51.245 --> 13:52.879
My breasts are getting crushed.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.814
I can loosen it for you.

13:54.815 --> 13:58.184
Okay, to about here.
No, no, a little less.

13:58.185 --> 14:00.153
I want my nipples to press,

14:00.154 --> 14:01.788
I don't want them

14:01.789 --> 14:03.089
to look like
they're levitating.

14:03.090 --> 14:05.191
- Okay.
- Thanks, darlin'.

14:05.192 --> 14:07.327
You're welcome.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.902
You were really
great tonight, miss...

14:15.903 --> 14:20.240
Cristal.
Thanks, darlin'.

14:20.241 --> 14:22.575
Andrew Carver sent you these?

14:22.576 --> 14:24.911
If that's what the card says,

14:24.912 --> 14:26.379
Then that's who sent it.

14:26.380 --> 14:27.947
I just love him.

14:27.948 --> 14:29.849
Oh. This is
my friend Nomi.

14:29.850 --> 14:32.585
- She's a dancer, too.
- Is she now?

14:32.586 --> 14:35.538
Yes, and she's really good.

14:35.539 --> 14:37.857
Where do you dance at?

14:37.858 --> 14:40.176
At the Cheetah.

14:40.177 --> 14:43.046
I don't know how good
you are, darlin',

14:43.047 --> 14:46.149
And I don't know
what it is you're good at,

14:46.150 --> 14:48.101
But if it's at the Cheetah,

14:48.102 --> 14:50.553
It's not dancing,
I know that much.

14:51.805 --> 14:54.090
You don't know shit!

14:56.260 --> 14:59.062
I'm really sorry, miss Connors.

14:59.063 --> 15:00.813
Cristal.

15:02.416 --> 15:03.917
I told you.

15:03.918 --> 15:06.252
Cristal.

15:06.253 --> 15:07.937
Your friend has nice nails.

15:07.938 --> 15:10.406
She does them herself.

15:10.407 --> 15:13.526
Maybe she can do mine sometime.

15:15.896 --> 15:18.831
Hey! Hey!

15:18.832 --> 15:20.783
Nomi!

15:20.784 --> 15:23.336
I work here, okay?

15:23.337 --> 15:25.588
I need my paycheck.

15:25.589 --> 15:27.907
I do not want her
to be pissed at me.

15:27.908 --> 15:30.510
I'm sorry!

15:32.963 --> 15:35.882
- I'm sorry.
- Jesus, Nomi.

15:42.773 --> 15:45.191
I'll drive you to work, okay?

15:45.192 --> 15:46.809
I'm not going.

15:46.810 --> 15:49.228
They'll fire you.

15:49.229 --> 15:50.863
Fuck, I don't care.

15:50.864 --> 15:53.199
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

15:55.869 --> 15:59.455
Okay, let's go.

15:59.456 --> 16:01.574
Where?

16:01.575 --> 16:03.943
You know where.

16:03.944 --> 16:07.096
Aaahh!

16:29.586 --> 16:32.055
She can dance, can't she?

16:32.056 --> 16:34.057
She thinks she can.

16:36.443 --> 16:38.995
I'm gonna go dance with her.

16:38.996 --> 16:42.048
Man, you can't do that.
You're working.

16:42.049 --> 16:44.367
T.C.'s gonna
have your ass.

16:44.368 --> 16:47.820
T.C.'s at the riviera
playing craps.

16:47.821 --> 16:51.040
- You want to dance?
- I am dancing.

16:51.041 --> 16:52.959
But do you want to dance with me?

16:52.960 --> 16:56.396
- You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

16:56.397 --> 16:58.514
I'm gonna have a drink.

17:19.936 --> 17:21.637
You can dance.

17:21.637 --> 17:24.107
I don't lie.
You can't.

17:24.108 --> 17:27.076
Then what am I doing?

17:28.879 --> 17:30.630
Teasing my dick.

17:30.631 --> 17:32.949
You got potential.
I could teach you.

17:32.950 --> 17:34.384
Yeah?

17:34.385 --> 17:36.836
Yeah.

17:38.172 --> 17:40.656
Ooh!

17:40.657 --> 17:44.427
- I'm not teasing it now, am I?
- Watch it, buddy.

17:44.428 --> 17:48.514
- Be cool. I'm a bouncer.
- You be cool, buddy.

18:01.779 --> 18:03.329
Nomi!

18:03.330 --> 18:05.782
- Hey, you!
- Hey!

18:05.783 --> 18:07.934
Hold her!
She started it.

18:07.935 --> 18:11.237
- Fuck you! Fuck you, asshole!
- Party's over.

18:13.273 --> 18:16.092
- Malone.
- Yeah.

18:16.093 --> 18:19.429
You're out of here.

18:19.430 --> 18:21.080
Hey, your release papers.

18:21.081 --> 18:22.448
Yo, what's up?

18:22.449 --> 18:24.050
I bailed you out, girl.

18:24.051 --> 18:26.418
Don't that even
give me a cup of coffee?

18:26.419 --> 18:29.772
All I did was tell you
I'd teach you to dance.

18:29.773 --> 18:32.758
I don't need nobody
to teach me to dance.

18:32.759 --> 18:34.811
That's because
you're a bad-ass.

18:34.812 --> 18:36.813
You got your arm straight out,

18:36.814 --> 18:38.147
Saying, "back off,
motherfucker."

18:38.148 --> 18:40.450
Back off, motherfucker!

18:42.753 --> 18:45.521
Whoo!
You know what?

18:45.522 --> 18:47.540
My head hurts, my dick hurts,

18:47.541 --> 18:50.159
And you got me fired
from my fucking job.

18:50.160 --> 18:52.211
Shit happens, you know?

18:52.212 --> 18:55.281
That's it?
That's what I get, fucking wisdom?

18:55.282 --> 18:57.216
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

18:57.217 --> 18:59.585
You get wisdom.

18:59.586 --> 19:01.954
You're not just
a pa in my dick.

19:01.955 --> 19:04.140
You're also a pain in my ass.

19:04.141 --> 19:05.725
You're not just
life sucks, you know? Y dick.

19:05.726 --> 19:07.126
"Life sucks"?
"shit happens"?

19:07.127 --> 19:09.345
You get this stuff
off of t-shirts?

19:10.797 --> 19:13.983
All I want is a cup of coffee.

19:13.984 --> 19:16.636
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:17.971 --> 19:19.572
You got a quarter?

19:19.573 --> 19:21.741
Sure. Here.

19:21.742 --> 19:23.609
Buy yourself a cup.

19:25.078 --> 19:27.146
Al is pissed.

19:27.147 --> 19:29.949
He says if you
miss another night...

19:29.950 --> 19:31.534
How did you get out?

19:31.535 --> 19:33.336
Him.
He bailed me out.

19:33.337 --> 19:36.589
- How come?
- I kicked him in the nuts.

19:36.590 --> 19:37.823
He liked it?

19:37.824 --> 19:40.827
- He must've.
- Nomi.

19:44.665 --> 19:47.967
Nomi, do my boobs
look any bigger to you?

19:47.968 --> 19:50.870
Shit. Carmi thinks
she's pregnant again.

19:50.871 --> 19:52.772
Girl, you missed
your period again?

19:52.773 --> 19:56.776
I don't know.
I don't think so.

19:56.777 --> 19:59.478
It's like a Japanese
convention out there.

19:59.479 --> 20:00.980
Hey, mama!

20:00.981 --> 20:02.315
Maybe you better get

20:02.316 --> 20:04.917
your little weenie jokes
cranked up there.

20:04.918 --> 20:06.586
This thing isn't working again.

20:06.587 --> 20:08.187
Come on, baby.

20:08.188 --> 20:10.356
Come on, here we go.

20:10.357 --> 20:12.358
One more time.
Harder. Harder.

20:12.359 --> 20:14.293
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

20:14.294 --> 20:17.163
Let me try it.

20:17.164 --> 20:20.199
Ladies, hey!

20:20.200 --> 20:24.036
Hey, I want you to meet hope.

20:24.037 --> 20:25.938
- Hi.
- Okay, cut it out.

20:25.939 --> 20:28.708
Hope, this is Tiffany,

20:28.709 --> 20:31.077
Farrah, Heather, Henrietta.

20:31.078 --> 20:34.814
My name isn't Hope.
My name's Penny.

20:34.815 --> 20:36.415
Ha ha ha...

20:37.918 --> 20:39.252
They want class,
dumb-dumb.

20:39.253 --> 20:41.254
They don't want to fuck a Penny.

20:41.255 --> 20:43.289
They want to fuck a Heather

20:43.290 --> 20:44.891
or a Tiffany.

20:44.892 --> 20:47.994
Or hope, huh?

20:47.995 --> 20:49.996
This is a class joint.

20:49.997 --> 20:51.080
You got that?

20:51.081 --> 20:54.083
Gentlemen and those
few ladies out there,

20:54.084 --> 20:56.752
What you've all
been waiting for...

20:56.753 --> 21:00.890
Henrietta...
Queen of bazooms!

21:13.403 --> 21:17.440
Hey, Henrietta! Hey, hey, hey!
Pull your dress up.

21:17.441 --> 21:18.941
You could never handle me

21:18.942 --> 21:20.910
with all these wrinkles of fat.

21:20.911 --> 21:25.064
Why, you'd never
even find the thing.

21:27.734 --> 21:30.703
I'd have to piss on you
to give you a clue.

21:33.357 --> 21:35.725
You need more pink.

21:35.726 --> 21:38.761
Thanks, Heather.

21:38.762 --> 21:41.163
Have you ever done
a lap dance before?

21:41.164 --> 21:42.999
No.

21:43.000 --> 21:45.334
Got to talk them into it, okay?

21:45.335 --> 21:48.337
50 bucks a pop, you
take them in the back.

21:48.338 --> 21:50.589
Touch and go.
They touch, they go.

21:50.590 --> 21:53.859
You can touch them.
They cannot touch you.

21:53.860 --> 21:55.528
Oh, that's good.

21:55.529 --> 21:57.930
If they come, it's okay.

21:57.931 --> 22:01.534
If they take it out, come all
over you, call the bouncer.

22:01.535 --> 22:05.271
If he gives you
a big tip, it's okay.

22:05.272 --> 22:07.440
You got that?

22:07.441 --> 22:10.109
Okay.

22:10.110 --> 22:12.228
Good.

22:12.229 --> 22:17.233
And you... Where the fuck
were you last night?

22:17.234 --> 22:19.635
I was having my period, al.

22:19.636 --> 22:23.556
You don't want blood
all over the place.

22:23.557 --> 22:25.191
Do you?

22:25.192 --> 22:28.844
I'm getting real tired
of your shit, kid.

22:28.845 --> 22:31.847
If you want to last
longer than a week,

22:31.848 --> 22:34.383
You'll give me a blow job.

22:34.384 --> 22:37.053
First I get you
used to the money,

22:37.054 --> 22:39.188
Then I make you swallow.

22:41.742 --> 22:43.976
Was he serious?

22:50.033 --> 22:52.852
<i>Here we are.</i>

22:56.073 --> 22:57.856
Hey.

22:57.857 --> 23:01.911

25:23.970 --> 25:26.355
You like her?

25:26.356 --> 25:28.340

Put your nightie on.

25:48.862 --> 25:50.896
Tell him to go fuck himself.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.531
Ha.

25:53.900 --> 25:56.302
I'll kick your ass out of here.

25:56.303 --> 25:59.338
Tell him.
Do yourself a favor.

25:59.339 --> 26:01.407
Okay,

26:01.408 --> 26:04.210
I'll put my nightie on.

26:30.870 --> 26:33.672
Hi. My name's
Heather.

26:50.923 --> 26:53.925
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!
- Want a drink?

26:53.926 --> 26:55.978
Hi, I'm Heather.

26:55.979 --> 26:57.947
Would you like a
private dance with me?

26:57.948 --> 27:00.482
Could I suck your tits?

27:00.483 --> 27:03.619
You can't touch me,
but I can touch you.

27:03.620 --> 27:05.371
I'd love to touch you.

27:05.372 --> 27:08.040
I know where you can touch me.

27:08.041 --> 27:10.159
Heather.

27:16.949 --> 27:19.802
What's going on?

27:19.803 --> 27:22.087
They want a private
dance with her.

27:24.391 --> 27:28.177
So? Great,
get over there.

27:28.178 --> 27:30.095
Hi. My name is Heather.

27:30.096 --> 27:33.649
Hey, Nomi.
I love your nails.

27:33.650 --> 27:36.151
We'd like you to private
dance with both of us.

27:36.152 --> 27:40.022
We don't do that.
One at a time, no women.

27:40.023 --> 27:42.024
$100.

27:42.025 --> 27:45.811
Sorry.
That's the rules.

27:45.812 --> 27:50.115
200. You just do Zack,
and I'll watch.

$500.

27:55.422 --> 27:57.673
Done.

28:00.844 --> 28:02.928

32:09.459 --> 32:11.627
Oh, but you love me.

32:11.628 --> 32:14.630
- Can you walk?
- Yeah.

32:15.965 --> 32:17.532
Good night, girls.

32:17.533 --> 32:20.102
- Good night, al.
- Get some rest.

32:24.607 --> 32:25.941
Go out and celebrate.

32:25.942 --> 32:28.910
We can go to my place
and smoke some dope.

32:28.911 --> 32:31.613
You still got some
of the thai stuff?

32:31.614 --> 32:34.650
I love thighs. I almost
get off on thighs.

32:34.651 --> 32:35.917
I like armpits, too.

32:35.918 --> 32:38.387
- You want to come, Nomi?
- Not me.

32:38.388 --> 32:43.025
- I'll come.
- Hey, you just got 500 off a lap dance.

32:43.026 --> 32:44.993
Al, just stop.

32:44.994 --> 32:47.412
You act like somebody died.

33:00.660 --> 33:02.644
Hey.

33:05.014 --> 33:06.815
Wait a minute.
Listen.

33:06.816 --> 33:09.101
Just listen.

33:09.102 --> 33:11.987
You got more natural
talent when you dance

33:11.988 --> 33:15.023
than anybody I've ever seen.

33:15.024 --> 33:17.909
I've seen a lot of dancers.

33:17.910 --> 33:20.912
I studied in new york...
Alvin ailey.

33:20.913 --> 33:23.865
You burn when you dance.

33:23.866 --> 33:25.684
Yeah, you said I couldn't.

33:25.685 --> 33:27.986
You got to hold some of it in.

33:27.987 --> 33:30.989
You got some shit to learn.
Dancing ain't fucking.

33:30.990 --> 33:33.491
What's that, more wisdom?
I know that.

33:33.492 --> 33:35.043
No, you don't.

33:35.044 --> 33:37.629
You dance like when you
fucked that guy last night.

33:37.630 --> 33:40.182
- What guy?
- That guy with the chick.

33:40.183 --> 33:42.968
You took them in the back.

33:42.969 --> 33:45.687
- I didn't fuck him.
- You fucked him and her.

33:45.688 --> 33:47.222
Are you following me?

33:47.223 --> 33:50.692
- I didn't fuck anybody.
- I saw you!

33:50.693 --> 33:52.694
Man, everybody
got aids and shit.

33:52.695 --> 33:55.480
What is it that
you think you do?

33:55.481 --> 33:58.183
You fuck them without fucking them.
That's what you do.

33:58.184 --> 33:59.985
Well, it ain't right.

33:59.986 --> 34:02.371
You got too much talent
for it to be right.

34:02.372 --> 34:03.989
Get out of here!

34:03.990 --> 34:07.159
Bitch, I'm telling you
the truth.

34:07.160 --> 34:10.395
You want me to go,
I'm out of here.

34:15.368 --> 34:17.202
- Boo!
- Uhh!

34:17.203 --> 34:20.038
- I got an "a."
- yay!

34:22.141 --> 34:25.560
Four more classes and they're gonna
have to give me that degree.

34:25.561 --> 34:27.512
Great.

34:27.513 --> 34:29.681
I haven't gotten laid
in six months.

34:29.681 --> 34:33.251
My right hand's so tight,
I can barely thread a needle.

34:33.252 --> 34:34.753
Use the left one.

34:34.754 --> 34:37.422
- For threading a needle?
- Yeah.

34:42.762 --> 34:45.864
Oh!
I like that.

34:45.864 --> 34:47.866
I can make that.

34:47.867 --> 34:49.467
Yeah?

34:49.469 --> 34:51.969
Yeah, let's go
to the fabric store.

34:53.973 --> 34:57.342
I want to buy it.
I've got the money.

34:57.343 --> 34:58.810
Why?

34:58.811 --> 35:01.713
I don't know.
I just do.

35:04.851 --> 35:07.352
I never had a dress like that.

35:08.821 --> 35:11.256
It'll look great on me.

35:14.260 --> 35:16.228
Won't it?

35:16.229 --> 35:17.963
Yeah.

35:21.267 --> 35:23.301
Ooh, what do you think?

35:23.302 --> 35:25.904
Oh, my goodness.

35:25.905 --> 35:27.272
Wow.

35:27.273 --> 35:29.841
It looks quite good on you.

35:29.842 --> 35:31.910
It doesn't suck.

35:31.911 --> 35:34.412
Ha ha ha ha.

35:34.413 --> 35:36.381
I can't believe I bought it.

35:36.382 --> 35:39.017
We'll celebrate.
I'll buy you a burrito.

35:39.018 --> 35:41.486
I'll even buy you some fajitas.

35:41.487 --> 35:44.289
Oh, fajitas.

35:44.290 --> 35:46.458
Fuck, I can't.
I'm on early.

35:46.459 --> 35:48.593
Al's on my back.

35:48.594 --> 35:51.813
- Don't worry. I'll drive you.
- Okay.

35:51.814 --> 35:55.083
Oh, my god!
Aah!

35:55.084 --> 35:57.135
He's coming here!

35:57.136 --> 35:59.104
Maybe you can meet him.

35:59.105 --> 36:01.072
I wouldn't know what to say.

36:01.073 --> 36:04.075
Say, "Andrew, I can't even
thread a needle anymore."

36:04.076 --> 36:06.311
Baby, mama's waiting for you.
Come to me.

36:06.312 --> 36:09.981
- Stop!
- I gotta get tickets to the concert.

36:46.168 --> 36:49.120
- Hey, baby, give it to me.
- Hey, come on.

36:49.121 --> 36:50.388
Come on, baby.

36:50.389 --> 36:52.741
- Hey...
- fuck off!

36:52.742 --> 36:55.677
Whoa, sorry.
Remember me?

36:55.678 --> 36:58.597
Phil Newkirk, Stardust Hotel.

36:58.598 --> 37:01.933
Listen, there's a spot
open in the chorus line.

37:01.934 --> 37:03.535
We're auditioning
tomorrow morning.

37:03.536 --> 37:05.887
I think you should try out.

37:05.888 --> 37:08.757
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

37:08.758 --> 37:10.875
You came here to ask me?

37:10.876 --> 37:14.813
When I saw you dance,
I thought, "yes."

37:16.432 --> 37:18.650
She sent you, didn't she?

37:18.651 --> 37:21.019
No, nobody sent me.

37:21.020 --> 37:22.854
Be there at 10:00.

37:24.891 --> 37:26.625
Hey!

37:26.626 --> 37:30.895
<i>The queen of bazooms...
Henrietta!</i>

37:30.896 --> 37:33.698

Molly!

37:51.550 --> 37:52.851
Molly!

37:52.852 --> 37:56.438
What?
What is it?

37:56.439 --> 38:00.725
I got an audition.
Ha ha. Aah!

38:10.236 --> 38:12.203
Hey, pollyanna.

38:12.204 --> 38:15.156
- What'd you call me?
- I said you look like pollyanna.

38:15.157 --> 38:18.977
Okay, ladies, I'm Tony Moss.

38:18.978 --> 38:21.513
I produce this show.

38:21.514 --> 38:24.549
Some of you probably
heard that I'm a prick.

38:24.550 --> 38:26.451
I am a prick.

38:26.452 --> 38:29.888
<i>I got one interest here
and that's the show.</i>

38:29.889 --> 38:32.273
I don't care whether
you live or die.

38:32.274 --> 38:35.176
I want to see you
dance and smile.

38:35.177 --> 38:37.178
I can't use you
if you can't smile,

38:37.179 --> 38:39.397
I can't use you
if you can't show.

38:39.398 --> 38:42.701
<i>I can't use you if you can't sell.
Let me look at you.</i>

38:42.702 --> 38:44.135
Spread out.

38:45.371 --> 38:48.406
<i>Spread out.
Jesus Christ!</i>

38:48.407 --> 38:50.442
Marty, look at these tits.

38:50.443 --> 38:52.077
What are these, watermelons?

38:52.078 --> 38:54.512
This is a stage, not a patch.

38:54.513 --> 38:57.148
See ya.

38:57.149 --> 38:58.717
I've seen you before.

38:58.718 --> 39:01.753
Yes, Mr. Moss, I auditioned
for you in January.

39:01.754 --> 39:04.155
You told me to
get my nose fixed.

39:04.156 --> 39:06.791
- Nose looks good.
- Thank you.

39:06.792 --> 39:09.177
- Nice smile, too.
- Thank you.

39:09.178 --> 39:11.829
But your ears are sticking out.
They are.

39:11.830 --> 39:15.934
Come see me when you get 'em fixed.
See ya.

39:15.935 --> 39:18.520
Can you spell "mgm" backwards?
I bet you can't.

39:18.521 --> 39:20.972
- M-g-m.
- I'm impressed.

39:20.973 --> 39:23.841
Come back when you've
fucked off this baby fat.

39:23.842 --> 39:28.346
- I hope you got some nice wigs, tennis ball.
- I do.

39:28.347 --> 39:30.315
What kind of classes
have you had?

39:30.316 --> 39:33.351
Ice skating classes, ballet
classes, technique classes,

39:33.352 --> 39:35.904
Stretch classes, jazz classes,
jazz technique classes.

39:35.905 --> 39:39.324
This show is called <i>Goddess,</i>
it ain't called <i>classes.</i>

39:39.325 --> 39:42.761
See ya. What kind of
classes have you had?

39:42.762 --> 39:44.863
I haven't had classes.

39:44.864 --> 39:46.498
What are you doing here?

39:46.499 --> 39:49.167
I'm watching you be a prick.

39:49.168 --> 39:52.203
Well, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

39:52.204 --> 39:54.739
Gay, run them
through the routine.

39:54.740 --> 39:57.175
All right, everyone
back up, find some space.

39:57.176 --> 39:59.144
Start with your right leg,

39:59.145 --> 40:02.897
Slap it on
1, 2, 3, and 4.

40:02.898 --> 40:04.566
Go!

40:04.567 --> 40:07.318
Go, 5, 6, 7.
Hit it!

40:07.319 --> 40:10.505
Bum-bah!
Ho! Ho!

40:10.506 --> 40:12.741
<i>Slam it!
Bum-bah!</i>

40:13.743 --> 40:17.011
Ho! Kick!

40:17.012 --> 40:18.913
Ha! Ha!

40:18.914 --> 40:21.066
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

40:21.067 --> 40:22.917
<i>And...
Stay there!</i>

40:22.918 --> 40:25.954
Relax. Take a break.

40:25.955 --> 40:28.623
Okay, tennis ball, dark
hair in the back...

40:28.624 --> 40:30.291
Hello, doll.

40:30.292 --> 40:33.928
- So how's it going?
- Pretty good.

40:33.929 --> 40:36.514
Okay.

40:36.515 --> 40:38.600
I want you to stay.

40:40.319 --> 40:41.953
And... You.

40:43.773 --> 40:47.759
And you, too. Goodbye, ladies,
you wasted my time and yours.

40:47.760 --> 40:51.029
<i>The other three,
line 'em up.</i>

40:53.966 --> 40:56.401
Okay, show me your tits.

40:57.703 --> 41:01.773
I got a topless show.
Let me see your tits.

41:17.156 --> 41:19.057
Very nice.

41:20.493 --> 41:23.294
Very nice, ladies.

41:23.295 --> 41:26.397
Gay, go to the other music.
Marty, change the lights.

41:26.398 --> 41:28.983
<i>Cue angel. Let's
come in at 20 seconds.</i>

41:28.984 --> 41:30.968
<i>Jack, bring up
the side spots.</i>

41:30.969 --> 41:32.403
<i>All right!</i>

41:35.140 --> 41:38.176
I want to see some attitude!

41:38.177 --> 41:40.728
I said attitude!

41:40.729 --> 41:45.867
Come on, ladies!
Sell! Sell your bodies!

41:48.354 --> 41:50.121
Cut it!

41:50.122 --> 41:53.391
Try yoga, babe, or hanging
from the ceiling.

41:53.392 --> 41:56.995
See ya.
Marty, ice.

41:56.996 --> 41:59.764
- You got something wrong with your nipples?
- No.

41:59.765 --> 42:02.567
- They're not sticking up. Stick them up.
- What?

42:02.568 --> 42:04.869
Play with them a little bit.

42:09.542 --> 42:11.142
Pinch them a little.

42:11.143 --> 42:13.511
You want me to, I'll do it.

42:26.108 --> 42:27.508
I'm erect.

42:27.509 --> 42:30.245
Why aren't you erect?

42:32.781 --> 42:35.917
Here, put some ice on them.

42:44.143 --> 42:46.144
I called that one right.

42:46.145 --> 42:48.212
See ya, pollyanna.

42:48.213 --> 42:51.549
<i>That's it for today.
Thank you.</i>

43:01.744 --> 43:04.829
You got me the audition, didn't you?

43:04.830 --> 43:06.864
Mm-hmm.

43:06.865 --> 43:08.866
Why?

43:10.753 --> 43:13.838
Maybe I like the way you dance.

43:13.839 --> 43:15.773
Maybe I like you.

43:15.774 --> 43:18.610
What difference does it make?

43:19.845 --> 43:22.931
Did you enjoy that out there?

43:24.300 --> 43:27.268
Yeah, darling, I think I did.

43:27.269 --> 43:30.672
I hate you.

43:30.673 --> 43:32.807
I know.

43:40.899 --> 43:43.901
Here...

43:43.902 --> 43:45.970
Wipe your nose.

43:56.215 --> 43:58.082
The orthodontist convention
is over there.

43:58.083 --> 44:00.852
The realtors are coming in in 20 minutes.
Let's line 'em up!

44:08.227 --> 44:12.063
- Hey!
- Hey.

44:12.064 --> 44:14.065
What are you doing here?

44:14.066 --> 44:16.133
I just did an audition.

44:16.134 --> 44:17.635
You want to be a showgirl?

44:17.636 --> 44:21.022
Smith, what are you doing?
Move those bags.

44:21.023 --> 44:25.026
Didn't go too good, huh?

44:25.027 --> 44:28.863
- Well, I'm glad about that.
- I'm not in the mood!

44:28.864 --> 44:32.650
Hey, Smith! Smith,
I'm talking to you.

44:32.651 --> 44:36.120
You don't want to be
in this kind of show.

44:36.121 --> 44:38.673
What you're doing,
at least it's honest.

44:38.674 --> 44:41.542
They want tits and ass, you
give them tits and ass.

44:41.543 --> 44:43.928
Here, they pretend
they want something else,

44:43.929 --> 44:46.464
And you still show them
tits and ass.

44:46.465 --> 44:50.435
Work her on your own time.
Go line up those bags.

44:50.436 --> 44:53.888
- I'm talking to her.
- You're what?

44:53.889 --> 44:57.358
I'm talking to her. I'm not working her.
I'm talking to her.

44:57.359 --> 44:59.861
And you're interrupting
my conversation,

44:59.862 --> 45:02.864
And that's rude.
Now get the fuck out of here!

45:02.865 --> 45:05.700
- Asshole.
- You're fired!

45:05.701 --> 45:07.702
Yeah?
Take this jacket.

45:07.703 --> 45:10.888
Come on.
Look what you done.

45:10.889 --> 45:12.824
You got me fired again.

45:12.825 --> 45:16.861
You're a real bad-ass.
Ain't you got no shame?

45:16.862 --> 45:19.747
You know what?
Look what a beautiful day it is.

45:19.748 --> 45:21.916
The sun's shining, neon's
blazing, money's flowing.

45:21.917 --> 45:25.870
I'm gonna cheer you up.
I'm gonna get you the best meal in town.

45:25.871 --> 45:28.039
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

45:30.109 --> 45:32.093
You like that burger.

45:32.094 --> 45:33.478
Uh-huh.

45:33.479 --> 45:35.480
Where are you from?

45:35.481 --> 45:39.067
Different places.

45:39.068 --> 45:42.236
You like talking
about you, huh?

45:53.098 --> 45:55.500
Where are we?

45:55.501 --> 45:57.869
- My place.
- Why?

45:57.870 --> 46:01.339
I want to show you something.

46:06.462 --> 46:08.963
The best suite in town.

46:08.964 --> 46:12.100
I had to beg
and plead to get it.

46:17.189 --> 46:19.757
This what you
wanted to show me?

46:19.758 --> 46:22.543
What, this nice big bed here?

46:22.544 --> 46:24.946
<i>Hmm?</i>

46:24.947 --> 46:27.031
I wrote this number.

46:27.032 --> 46:29.433
It's about you.

46:29.434 --> 46:31.619
You don't know
anything about me.

46:31.620 --> 46:33.905
I know you're a private dancer.

46:35.273 --> 46:37.875
I only need three other girls.

46:37.876 --> 46:41.278
We can put it on
at the crave club.

46:41.279 --> 46:43.714
I'll show you.

46:43.715 --> 46:46.717
Stand right here.
Watch me.

46:51.190 --> 46:55.309
Wait a minute.
Slow down! Like this?

46:55.310 --> 46:57.578
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

46:59.665 --> 47:01.649
Ssss... Bang!

47:09.174 --> 47:12.176
Come on now, follow me.
I know you can.

48:31.240 --> 48:34.191
Mmm! I got my period.

48:34.192 --> 48:36.193
Yeah, right.

48:36.194 --> 48:37.828
Check.

48:41.984 --> 48:45.086
- Oh.
- See?

48:49.708 --> 48:52.126
It's all right.
I got towels.

48:55.297 --> 48:58.432
You can fuck me
when you love me.

49:03.355 --> 49:06.707
- But I do love you.
- Yeah, right.

49:06.708 --> 49:09.727
You don't fool me.
I see you.

49:09.728 --> 49:11.896
What do you see?

49:11.897 --> 49:14.282
- I see you hiding.
- From what?

49:14.283 --> 49:16.334
From you.

49:22.240 --> 49:25.042
You got into some bad shit
someplace, didn't you?

49:25.043 --> 49:27.995
Thanks for the hamburger. Hey!

49:31.833 --> 49:35.686
Where were you? What happened?
Tony Moss called.

49:35.687 --> 49:40.358
He said to call him right away.
Here's the number. Call him.

49:40.359 --> 49:42.476
Oh, Jesus.
I'll call him.

49:45.430 --> 49:47.565
Tony Moss, please.

49:47.566 --> 49:49.734
It's Nomi Malone.

49:51.903 --> 49:54.171
Yes?

49:54.172 --> 49:55.806
Yes.

49:57.109 --> 49:59.243
Okay.

50:02.247 --> 50:04.265
I got it.

50:04.266 --> 50:07.652
<i>♪ She's the yellow rose of Texas ♪</i>

50:07.653 --> 50:09.337
♪ she charges 50 bucks ♪

50:09.338 --> 50:11.005
♪ She's the richest whore in Texas ♪

50:11.006 --> 50:13.090

50:13.091 --> 50:15.826

- I'm gone.

50:15.827 --> 50:18.896
- I got another job.
- Where you going?

50:18.897 --> 50:21.032
You going to another club?

50:21.033 --> 50:24.869
They giving you a better cut?
I'll match it.

50:24.870 --> 50:28.439
I'm in "Goddess"
at the Stardust.

50:28.440 --> 50:31.859
Oh.
Ha ha ha ha!

50:31.860 --> 50:33.894
What's so fucking funny?

50:33.895 --> 50:36.030
She's going down
to the Stardust.

50:36.031 --> 50:38.949
She's gonna be in the show.

50:38.950 --> 50:40.251
Good for her.

50:40.252 --> 50:43.070
La de dah de dah de dah.

50:43.071 --> 50:44.672
She'll be back.

50:44.673 --> 50:47.808
No, I won't.
I'll never come back.

50:47.809 --> 50:50.895
You're a fucking stripper.
Don't you get it?

50:50.896 --> 50:55.199
- I'm a dancer.
- If you're a dancer, then Henry's the virgin Mary.

50:55.200 --> 50:57.902
I got bigger tits than
the fucking virgin Mary.

50:57.903 --> 51:01.455
- And I got a bigger mouth, too.
- Bye.

51:01.456 --> 51:03.474
God damn it.

51:03.475 --> 51:07.061
You're the only one who could
get my tits popping right.

51:07.062 --> 51:08.679
See ya, al.

51:08.680 --> 51:12.049
I'm not hiring you
back. You hear me?

51:12.050 --> 51:15.186
Not even if you give me
a fucking blow job.

51:23.328 --> 51:25.296
James!

51:25.297 --> 51:29.166
James! Come on!

51:29.167 --> 51:30.735
I got it!

51:30.736 --> 51:33.087
- Got what?
- I'm in the show...

51:33.088 --> 51:35.372
In "Goddess."

51:35.373 --> 51:39.927
Oh, man. What about the
number I wrote for you?

51:39.928 --> 51:44.048
I thought we were
working on something.

51:44.049 --> 51:46.050
<i>James.</i>

51:56.144 --> 51:58.529
She gonna be in your number?

51:58.530 --> 52:00.314
I'll be right there.

52:00.315 --> 52:03.100
She can't dance.

52:03.101 --> 52:05.569
Yeah, but you're going
to teach her, right?

52:07.622 --> 52:11.492
She's got talent. Right?

52:11.493 --> 52:15.629
You know, you and me,
we ain't got no ties.

52:18.884 --> 52:22.219
Dancing and fucking, right?

52:25.807 --> 52:28.976
Yeah, that's right.

52:30.145 --> 52:32.930
See ya.

52:42.007 --> 52:44.909
Who was that?

52:44.910 --> 52:46.710
Uh...

52:46.711 --> 52:49.647
Just somebody that wanted
to be in the number.

52:49.648 --> 52:52.649
You're not going to give
her my part, are you?

52:52.650 --> 52:56.787
- No, baby. She can't dance.
- No?

52:56.788 --> 53:00.891
I wrote that number for you.
You know that. Yeah.

53:00.892 --> 53:03.260
Ow!

53:08.049 --> 53:10.251
Excuse me.

53:10.252 --> 53:12.086
What can I do for you?

53:12.087 --> 53:16.056
I'm supposed to see Mr.
Moss. I'm Nomi Malone.

53:16.057 --> 53:18.158
Okay, go on in.

53:24.132 --> 53:26.500
One day she looks
like pollyanna,

53:26.501 --> 53:29.169
The next day she looks like...

53:29.170 --> 53:31.238
I don't know, Lolita maybe.

53:31.239 --> 53:32.990
Nice dress.

53:32.991 --> 53:36.093
Thanks. I bought it at <i>Versayce.</i>

53:40.482 --> 53:42.516
In the forum.

53:42.517 --> 53:44.335
Oh, yeah. Versayce.

53:44.336 --> 53:47.004
- I love Versayce.
- Me, too.

53:47.005 --> 53:50.090
- You know Marty.
- Hi.

53:50.091 --> 53:52.393
- Hi.
- Gay's our line Captain.

53:52.394 --> 53:55.563
- Hi.
- If you let me down,

53:55.564 --> 53:59.400
I could lose my reputation for
being such an all-knowing prick.

53:59.401 --> 54:02.186
I worked very hard
for that reputation,

54:02.187 --> 54:06.056
- So don't do it. Deal?
- Deal.

54:06.057 --> 54:09.559
- Gay will show you around.
- Let's get going.

54:09.560 --> 54:12.980
Nomi, we'll do a run-through
this afternoon.

54:12.981 --> 54:14.848
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

54:14.849 --> 54:17.885
They always say that in Vegas
just before they take your money.

54:17.886 --> 54:20.287
You need to maintain
your weight.

54:20.288 --> 54:22.590
Eat a lot of brown rice
and vegetables.

54:22.591 --> 54:24.425
And stay indoors.

54:24.426 --> 54:26.594
I don't want to see tan lines.

54:26.595 --> 54:30.397
Your makeup and costumes are your
responsibility. Don't take them home.

54:30.398 --> 54:34.301
Whatever you do, don't ever,
ever go out on stage crying.

54:34.302 --> 54:37.655
You do eat brown rice and
vegetables, don't you?

54:37.656 --> 54:40.524
- Sure.
- Good.

54:40.525 --> 54:42.159
This is your table.

54:42.160 --> 54:45.863
If you're smart...
and I was smart...

54:45.864 --> 54:48.365
You'll figure out
a job and a man

54:48.366 --> 54:52.636
- for later on.
- How'd you find your guy?

54:52.637 --> 54:56.307
I chipped my tooth on a quaalude.
He was my dentist.

54:56.308 --> 54:59.677
You'll be running this
monster six times a night.

54:59.678 --> 55:01.946
I'll take you up to personnel.

55:01.947 --> 55:06.000
- They want some information.
- What kind of information?

55:06.001 --> 55:08.519
Date of birth.

55:08.520 --> 55:11.972
7-3, um... 73.

55:11.973 --> 55:15.959
- Place of birth.
- New York.

55:15.960 --> 55:19.063
- New York, New York?
- Yeah.

55:19.064 --> 55:22.766
Nearest family members.

55:27.772 --> 55:30.174
I don't have any family.

55:30.175 --> 55:31.942
Deceased?

55:31.943 --> 55:34.411
Yes.

55:34.412 --> 55:37.414
Have you ever been arrested?

55:37.415 --> 55:39.516
<i>Charged with a criminal offense?</i>

55:39.517 --> 55:41.051
No.

55:45.206 --> 55:47.508
Social security.

55:47.509 --> 55:50.110
Uh...

55:50.111 --> 55:54.181
I don't know.
But let me check that for you, okay?

55:57.635 --> 56:00.504
Hey, you got it.

56:00.505 --> 56:02.723
Nice going.
That's great.

56:02.724 --> 56:04.358
Zack, this is Nomi Malone.

56:04.359 --> 56:06.510
Sure, I remember her. Hi.

56:06.511 --> 56:08.145
I bet you do remember her.

56:08.146 --> 56:09.947
Well, she's pretty memorable.

56:09.948 --> 56:12.583
Glad you're part of the team. Nice dress.

56:12.584 --> 56:14.368
It's a Versayce.

56:14.369 --> 56:16.537
It's <i>Versace.</i>

56:16.538 --> 56:18.205
What?

56:18.206 --> 56:22.626
Versace.
It's pronounced <i>Versace.</i>

56:22.627 --> 56:25.496
Oh.

56:25.497 --> 56:27.297
You got great taste.

56:27.298 --> 56:30.334
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

56:32.337 --> 56:35.139
Girls!
Up at the ceiling.

56:35.140 --> 56:38.275
This is Nomi. Nicky, Julie, Deena.
You know Gay.

56:38.276 --> 56:41.979
They'll run through it.
You just watch and then we'll blend you in.

56:41.980 --> 56:43.947
- Have you eaten anything?
- No.

56:43.948 --> 56:47.351
- Jack! What do you want?
- Burger, fries, and soda.

56:47.352 --> 56:49.353
Get her some brown rice, vegetables,

56:49.354 --> 56:54.291
And a bottle of Evian.
Nomi, no, come take a look at this first.

56:54.292 --> 56:58.429
Here we go! 5, 6, 7, 8!

56:59.330 --> 57:01.432
Hah!
Hoh! 2, 3!

57:01.433 --> 57:04.802
Hah! Hah!

57:04.803 --> 57:06.603
Hah! There!

57:06.604 --> 57:08.672
- You're gonna try it now. You ready?
- Yeah.

57:08.673 --> 57:11.442
Try it now. Go!
5, 6, 7, hit it!

57:14.145 --> 57:17.714
Hoh! Bam!
Kick it! Work it!

57:17.715 --> 57:21.785
Hold it!
Nomi, what kind of turn was that?

57:21.786 --> 57:25.722
Do a piqué turn.
Come on. That's it.

57:25.723 --> 57:27.157
Okay, music.

57:27.158 --> 57:30.427
<i>Go! </i> Hah! Go!

57:30.428 --> 57:33.464
Yes! Hah!

57:33.465 --> 57:36.467
Higher.
Not that high.

57:37.836 --> 57:39.536
Stay in sync.

57:39.537 --> 57:42.306
1, 2, 3, 1!

57:42.307 --> 57:45.442
Thrust it! Thrust it!
Thrust it!

57:45.443 --> 57:49.012
Thrust it!
Come on, thrust it!

57:49.013 --> 57:51.748
Okay, that's enough.
Thank you, ladies.

57:56.321 --> 57:58.422
- Good job.
- Thank you.

57:58.423 --> 58:01.525
Gay, work with her on her turns.
I'm worried about her balance.

58:01.526 --> 58:03.844
How long before
I can do the show?

58:03.845 --> 58:06.613
You're starting tonight.

58:06.614 --> 58:09.917
- Tonight?
- You'll be fine.

58:11.753 --> 58:13.137
How did she do?

58:13.138 --> 58:14.688
She's no butterfly.

58:14.689 --> 58:16.690
Tony, she's all pelvic thrust.

58:16.691 --> 58:19.726
I mean, she prowls.
She's got it.

58:19.727 --> 58:22.095
I wonder how she got it.

58:22.096 --> 58:24.064
She certainly didn't learn it.

58:24.065 --> 58:26.500
She learned it, but they
don't teach it in any class.

58:28.570 --> 58:30.604
Wait, you need more orange.

58:30.605 --> 58:32.272
Let me do it.

58:34.108 --> 58:37.277
- How do you feel?
- Oh! Don't ask.

58:37.278 --> 58:39.479
Who the hell took my makeup?

58:39.480 --> 58:42.282
- Monkey alert! Monkey alert!
- No!

58:43.918 --> 58:45.519
<i>God damn it, Hector!</i>

58:45.520 --> 58:47.521
I told you if this
happened again...

58:47.522 --> 58:50.791
- They make babies. I'm sorry.
- Babies?

58:50.792 --> 58:52.960
Oh! Oh, get out.

58:57.465 --> 58:59.299
<i>Grab her!</i> Grab her!

58:59.300 --> 59:01.268
I've got one.

59:01.269 --> 59:03.103
Thank you.

59:03.104 --> 59:07.007
Julie, you fucking slut!
Touch my makeup again, I'll kill you!

59:07.008 --> 59:09.509
Oh, <i>I'm</i> a slut?
You fucked that kid from the pizza place.

59:09.510 --> 59:11.144
You fucked the meter reader.

59:11.145 --> 59:13.513
- Bitch!
- You're fucking dead!

59:13.514 --> 59:18.185
Come on, you two!
For Christ sakes!

59:18.186 --> 59:21.154
Calm down!
Stop it!

59:21.155 --> 59:22.756
It's done!
It's done!

59:25.560 --> 59:28.161
Showtime.

59:28.162 --> 59:30.931
Move it!
You got four counts of eight.

59:30.932 --> 59:32.633
Nomi, wait, your wig.

59:32.634 --> 59:35.202
You're fine.
Move up, you guys.

59:35.203 --> 59:37.971
There's shit on the stage, honey.

59:37.972 --> 59:39.740
It's that damn garlic.

59:39.741 --> 59:41.174
- Where is it, Jack?
- Up left.

59:41.175 --> 59:43.577
Guys, upstage left...
monkey shit.

59:43.578 --> 59:45.212
You want some blow?

59:45.213 --> 59:47.614
Last chance ice.

59:49.751 --> 59:52.853
<i>Go! Go!</i> Pick it up.
<i>Let's go.</i>

59:52.854 --> 59:55.022
<i>Come on, you guys.</i>
<i>Move faster.</i> Pick it up.

59:55.023 --> 59:56.990
<i>Brian, go!</i>

59:59.127 --> 01:00:00.727
See ya.

01:00:00.728 --> 01:00:03.247
<i>All right, everybody,
let's go!</i>

01:00:03.248 --> 01:00:05.048
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

01:00:05.049 --> 01:00:07.084
I love you.

01:00:07.085 --> 01:00:10.637
Come on, you guys. Keep it moving.
Nomi, pick it up.

01:00:13.524 --> 01:00:17.110
Nomi, wait.
Two beats.

01:00:17.111 --> 01:00:19.730
1, 2. Go!

01:00:28.873 --> 01:00:31.441
- Oh!
- Shit.

01:00:48.359 --> 01:00:50.444
Yeah!

01:01:06.928 --> 01:01:10.797
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the
Stardust proudly presents...</i>

01:01:10.798 --> 01:01:13.100
<i>Miss Cristal Connors!</i>

01:02:05.053 --> 01:02:06.670
Yeah.

01:02:16.814 --> 01:02:19.683
Nomi, you got two minutes.
You gotta change into your red wig.

01:02:19.684 --> 01:02:22.319
I'll get your costume.

01:02:25.356 --> 01:02:27.891
Nomi, Nomi.

01:02:27.892 --> 01:02:29.493
Slip this on.

01:02:29.494 --> 01:02:31.695
- Did I do okay?
- Yeah, you did fine.

01:02:31.696 --> 01:02:34.614
Your right leg extension needs work.
Eight steps on the sweep, not six.

01:02:34.615 --> 01:02:36.516
I'll have someone work with you tomorrow.
Be here at noon.

01:02:36.517 --> 01:02:40.170
- Okay.
- Put this on. You're done.

01:02:40.171 --> 01:02:44.341
- Yay!
- Yay!

01:02:44.342 --> 01:02:46.243
I didn't fall.

01:02:46.244 --> 01:02:48.178
You did.
You nearly fell.

01:02:48.179 --> 01:02:51.148
Yo. Can I talk
to you a minute?

01:02:51.149 --> 01:02:54.317
Come on, please.

01:02:54.318 --> 01:02:56.052
Talk.

01:02:56.053 --> 01:02:58.021
Alone.

01:02:58.022 --> 01:03:00.424
- I'll get the car.
- I'll be right there.

01:03:02.994 --> 01:03:04.644
Yeah?

01:03:04.645 --> 01:03:06.279
Who sent you the flowers?

01:03:08.616 --> 01:03:10.200
None of your business.

01:03:10.201 --> 01:03:13.603
Okay, look, I just
wanted to say...

01:03:13.604 --> 01:03:15.806
You and me ain't got no ties.

01:03:20.578 --> 01:03:22.479
I have a problem with pussy.

01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:24.464
I always have, always gonna.

01:03:24.465 --> 01:03:26.917
But I meant what I said.

01:03:26.918 --> 01:03:29.786
I'm not interested
in your problems.

01:03:29.787 --> 01:03:32.439
I did write it for you,

01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:34.608
But I did tell her
I'd teach her

01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:36.810
I did write it
and I did fuck her.

01:03:36.811 --> 01:03:38.778
Who you fuck is your business,

01:03:38.779 --> 01:03:41.882
And I'm not making it mine.

01:03:41.883 --> 01:03:44.601
It's not like
I'm seeing any money

01:03:44.602 --> 01:03:46.486
for writing that number.

01:03:46.487 --> 01:03:49.489
I may well touch
a little pussy.

01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:53.276
You ain't got nothing to say?

01:03:53.277 --> 01:03:56.012
No.

01:03:56.013 --> 01:03:58.515
Thanks for the flowers.

01:03:58.516 --> 01:04:01.418
Tony said you did great.

01:04:01.419 --> 01:04:04.721
- I never got flowers before.
- Really?

01:04:04.722 --> 01:04:07.524
Well, I'm sure
you'll get lots of them.

01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:11.495
He gave them to you?

01:04:11.496 --> 01:04:13.463
Yeah, he did.

01:04:13.464 --> 01:04:16.166
What is he, a pimp?

01:04:16.167 --> 01:04:18.702
Only people I know
got pimp cars are pimps.

01:04:18.703 --> 01:04:21.988
He's the
entertainment director.

01:04:21.989 --> 01:04:24.391
That's exactly what I
said... he's a pimp.

01:04:24.392 --> 01:04:26.560
<i>Hey, Nomes.
Let's go.</i>

01:04:28.763 --> 01:04:30.630
Good luck with
your number, James.

01:04:30.631 --> 01:04:32.699
I'm sure you're gonna teach her

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:35.101
to be a great dancer.

01:04:54.672 --> 01:04:56.640
Hello?

01:04:58.676 --> 01:05:02.112
- Anybody here?
- <i>Back here.</i>

01:05:03.648 --> 01:05:05.649
What are you doing here?

01:05:05.650 --> 01:05:07.734
What am I doing here?

01:05:07.735 --> 01:05:11.387
I'm doing some of the finest cocaine

01:05:11.388 --> 01:05:14.107
in the world, darlin'.
You want some?

01:05:14.108 --> 01:05:16.159
Mnh-mnh.

01:05:18.663 --> 01:05:21.031
It's great for the muscles.

01:05:23.801 --> 01:05:26.953
I told Marty I'd work on
your turns with you, darlin',

01:05:26.954 --> 01:05:30.040
but I'm feeling a little turned
inside-out myself today.

01:05:30.041 --> 01:05:31.725
Cut the shit.

01:05:31.726 --> 01:05:33.560
Okay.

01:05:33.861 --> 01:05:36.713
We got off on the wrong foot.

01:05:37.214 --> 01:05:40.917
You want to start
dancing all over again?

01:05:40.918 --> 01:05:44.721
- Why?
- Why not?

01:05:45.622 --> 01:05:49.092
You want to walk down to
Spago, get something to eat?

01:05:49.093 --> 01:05:50.727
Where is it?

01:05:50.728 --> 01:05:51.928
Just down
from <i>Versayce.</i>

01:05:51.929 --> 01:05:56.783
- Versace.
- Oh, right. Versace.

01:05:56.784 --> 01:05:58.618
Yeah.

01:05:58.619 --> 01:06:00.587
<i>Right this way.</i>

01:06:10.031 --> 01:06:11.865
Enjoy.

01:06:15.636 --> 01:06:17.771
I don't know what all this stuff is.

01:06:17.772 --> 01:06:19.773
I'll order for you.

01:06:19.774 --> 01:06:21.074
Don't they have

01:06:21.075 --> 01:06:23.143
brown rice and vegetables?

01:06:23.144 --> 01:06:26.663
Do you like brown rice and vegetables?

01:06:26.664 --> 01:06:28.498
Yeah.

01:06:28.499 --> 01:06:30.133
You do?

01:06:30.134 --> 01:06:33.169
Sort of.

01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:35.138
Really?

01:06:37.541 --> 01:06:39.876
It's worse than dog food.

01:06:39.877 --> 01:06:41.878
It is.

01:06:43.914 --> 01:06:46.082
I've had dog food.

01:06:47.718 --> 01:06:49.552
You have?

01:06:49.553 --> 01:06:53.506
Mm-hmm.
A long time ago.

01:06:53.507 --> 01:06:55.709
Doggy Chow.

01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:59.062
I used to love Doggy Chow.

01:06:59.063 --> 01:07:02.766
I used to love Doggy Chow too.

01:07:14.979 --> 01:07:17.647
I get a headache from champagne.

01:07:17.648 --> 01:07:20.550
Oh, this isn't champagne.

01:07:20.551 --> 01:07:23.753
This is holy water.

01:07:23.754 --> 01:07:26.656
I named myself after this holy water.

01:07:26.657 --> 01:07:28.558
Chrissie Lou Connors

01:07:28.559 --> 01:07:30.560
used to have dingy brown hair

01:07:30.561 --> 01:07:32.028
and little bitty tits.

01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:35.899
It's amazing what paint
and a surgeon can do.

01:07:44.575 --> 01:07:46.743
You have great tits.

01:07:46.744 --> 01:07:49.112
They're really beautiful.

01:07:49.113 --> 01:07:51.865
Thank you.

01:07:51.866 --> 01:07:54.851
I like nice tits.

01:07:54.852 --> 01:07:58.755
I always have.
How about you?

01:07:58.756 --> 01:08:01.324
I like having nice tits.

01:08:01.325 --> 01:08:04.360
How do you like having them?

01:08:08.899 --> 01:08:10.900
What do you mean?

01:08:10.901 --> 01:08:14.104
You know what I mean.

01:08:17.174 --> 01:08:20.310
I like having them in a nice dress

01:08:20.310 --> 01:08:23.179
or a tight top.

01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:24.948
Hmm.

01:08:24.948 --> 01:08:27.917
You like to show them off.

01:08:30.054 --> 01:08:32.721
I didn't like showing
them off at the Cheetah.

01:08:32.723 --> 01:08:36.826
Why not?
I liked looking at them there.

01:08:36.827 --> 01:08:39.729
Everybody liked looking
at them there.

01:08:39.729 --> 01:08:42.499
Made me feel like a hooker.

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:45.502
- You are a whore, darlin'.
- No, I'm not.

01:08:45.502 --> 01:08:48.638
We all are.
We take the cash,

01:08:48.639 --> 01:08:52.041
we cash the check.
We show them what they want to see.

01:08:52.042 --> 01:08:55.211
Maybe you are a whore, but I'm not.

01:08:57.948 --> 01:09:00.683
You and me...

01:09:00.684 --> 01:09:02.952
we're exactly alike.

01:09:05.156 --> 01:09:07.023
Mnh-mnh.

01:09:11.729 --> 01:09:14.764
I'll never be like you.

01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:21.770
Miss Connors, sorry to bother you.

01:09:21.772 --> 01:09:23.406
Would you sign this for me?

01:09:23.407 --> 01:09:25.642
I'd be happy to, darlin'.
What's your name?

01:09:25.643 --> 01:09:28.478
Frank.
I'm from Galveston.

01:09:28.479 --> 01:09:31.113
I'm just a little old farm girl
from Del Rio myself, Frank.

01:09:31.115 --> 01:09:35.285
I told you she was from Texas.
Look at that.

01:09:35.286 --> 01:09:37.252
Could I have me one?

01:09:37.254 --> 01:09:40.223
You want a girl to use up
all her lipstick on you?

01:09:40.224 --> 01:09:42.192
You want to dance?

01:09:42.193 --> 01:09:44.661
- Right now?
- It's now or never.

01:09:44.662 --> 01:09:46.930
That's what Elvis said.

01:09:50.050 --> 01:09:52.268
Know the best advice I ever got?

01:09:52.269 --> 01:09:54.837
You're up there on stage,

01:09:54.838 --> 01:09:56.940
Hoping on a spot.

01:09:56.941 --> 01:10:00.509
If someone gets in your
way, step on them.

01:10:00.510 --> 01:10:03.179
If you're the only one
left standing there,

01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:06.816
they hire you. That's about it.

01:10:06.817 --> 01:10:09.068
Thank you and good night,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:09.069 --> 01:10:11.654
Elvis has left the building.

01:11:17.621 --> 01:11:19.689
You see, darlin'?

01:11:19.690 --> 01:11:21.724
You are a whore.

01:11:24.795 --> 01:11:26.362
Bitch.

01:11:31.318 --> 01:11:33.403
I guess we're done.

01:11:38.609 --> 01:11:42.745
Right here. Right here. Thank you.

01:11:45.482 --> 01:11:48.651
- Nicky, can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

01:11:48.652 --> 01:11:51.971
Listen, after the show...

01:11:51.972 --> 01:11:54.741
Coming through.

01:11:54.742 --> 01:11:58.511
- Mommy, can we see the monkeys?
- Not now. They're busy.

01:11:58.512 --> 01:12:01.130
- Please, they're so cute.
- They have to work.

01:12:01.131 --> 01:12:04.801
- What are they doing?
- I want to see the monkeys!

01:12:04.802 --> 01:12:06.736
Why can't we see the monkeys?

01:12:06.737 --> 01:12:08.621
Get these fucking kids out of here!

01:12:08.622 --> 01:12:10.623
You said the "f" word.

01:12:10.624 --> 01:12:12.158
She said the "f" word.

01:12:12.159 --> 01:12:14.177
<i>You said the "f" word.</i>

01:12:14.178 --> 01:12:15.712
Shut the fuck up.

01:12:17.648 --> 01:12:21.384
Shh. It's okay.

01:12:23.037 --> 01:12:26.222
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Let's get out of here.

01:12:26.223 --> 01:12:29.492
Nomi, there's a boat convention

01:12:29.493 --> 01:12:32.228
coming into town next week.
They need a couple of girls.

01:12:32.229 --> 01:12:34.297
Nicky's doing it.
You interested?

01:12:34.298 --> 01:12:35.765
Pays $1,000.

01:12:37.301 --> 01:12:39.835
$1,000?

01:12:39.836 --> 01:12:41.220
To do what?

01:12:41.221 --> 01:12:43.122
Just represent
your hotel for a day...

01:12:43.123 --> 01:12:46.192
Wear your costumes and your smile
and they take your picture.

01:12:46.193 --> 01:12:49.862
- $1,000?
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:49.863 --> 01:12:51.931
Yeah.

01:12:51.932 --> 01:12:54.801
Great.
Cristal here recommended you.

01:12:57.821 --> 01:12:59.989
Thanks.

01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:03.493
My pleasure, darlin'.
Just looking out for you.

01:13:03.494 --> 01:13:07.230
- We got to talk about that magazine layout.
- Later, later, later.

01:13:07.231 --> 01:13:08.748
Don't do it.

01:13:08.749 --> 01:13:10.750
What? It's $1,000.
Why not?

01:13:10.751 --> 01:13:13.702
- Molly, I need you.
- Yes, I'm coming.

01:13:13.703 --> 01:13:17.840
- I know some girls who've done it before.
- Molly, I'm waiting.

01:13:17.841 --> 01:13:20.610
They didn't like it.

01:13:26.216 --> 01:13:28.151
Did you do it before?

01:13:28.152 --> 01:13:30.886
- Yeah.
- Did you like it?

01:13:30.887 --> 01:13:34.006
Did I like it?
Sure, I liked it.

01:13:59.399 --> 01:14:01.768
<i>Let's hear it for these
two beautiful girls</i>

01:14:01.769 --> 01:14:05.004
<i>from "Goddess," the new
smash at the Stardust!</i>

01:14:07.174 --> 01:14:09.509
- Thank you.
- Pardon me.

01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:12.879
- Hey, hey, guys.
- Shit, here he comes.

01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:14.447
- How's it going?
- Hi.

01:14:14.448 --> 01:14:17.383
- Tough gig, huh?
- Very tough.

01:14:17.384 --> 01:14:21.087
This is my good friend Mr.
Okida. He's from Bangkok.

01:14:21.088 --> 01:14:24.123
He's one of our very,
very high rollers.

01:14:24.124 --> 01:14:26.292
Ladies, we got a great idea.

01:14:26.293 --> 01:14:29.028
We want to take you girls
to dinner after the show...

01:14:29.029 --> 01:14:31.330
have some lobster, hear Caesar sing.

01:14:31.331 --> 01:14:34.867
You ever heard Caesar sing?
Man, that guy's great.

01:14:34.868 --> 01:14:36.369
You'll love him.

01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:39.071
- Caesar sing.
- Yeah, Caesar will sing,

01:14:39.072 --> 01:14:41.574
And then we'll go back to
my place and we'll sing,

01:14:41.575 --> 01:14:44.577
<i>Just the four of us.</i>

01:14:44.578 --> 01:14:46.746
How about it?

01:14:48.749 --> 01:14:50.917
We sing.

01:14:52.719 --> 01:14:56.689
Yeah, we'll sing
a lot of songs.

01:14:56.690 --> 01:15:00.193
- Yeah?
- Okay.

01:15:00.194 --> 01:15:04.730
- Okay, good deal.
- Okay, good deal.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:08.668
Not me.

01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:12.705
Whoa.
Excuse me. Hey!

01:15:12.706 --> 01:15:15.141
Hey, hey! Be nice.

01:15:15.142 --> 01:15:17.276
Get your hands off me!

01:15:17.277 --> 01:15:18.945
You're getting $1,000 for this.

01:15:18.946 --> 01:15:21.497
For this! This!

01:15:21.498 --> 01:15:24.433
Hey, forget it. Just forget it.
No harm done.

01:15:24.434 --> 01:15:26.202
No damage.

01:15:26.203 --> 01:15:27.970
Christ.

01:15:27.971 --> 01:15:31.274
<i>Is that right?
Okay, tell me another one.</i>

01:15:31.275 --> 01:15:35.695
<i>- No, it's the truth.
- Come on, just tell me one more.</i>

01:15:35.696 --> 01:15:38.164
- Zack.
- Yeah

01:15:38.165 --> 01:15:40.132
I want to talk to you.

01:15:40.133 --> 01:15:43.569
Sure.

01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:45.571
Let's go upstairs.

01:15:45.572 --> 01:15:48.658
Did you have a nice day, darlin'?

01:15:48.659 --> 01:15:50.493
No.

01:15:52.379 --> 01:15:55.331
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:15:57.117 --> 01:15:59.802
Jesus.

01:16:02.472 --> 01:16:04.373
I'm sorry.

01:16:04.374 --> 01:16:07.343
Some people just don't get it.

01:16:07.344 --> 01:16:09.312
I'm on the stage.

01:16:09.313 --> 01:16:11.480
<i>Get me Phil Newkirk,
would you?</i>

01:16:11.481 --> 01:16:14.734
- Right.
- Thank you.

01:16:14.735 --> 01:16:16.135
I want you to stay.

01:16:17.771 --> 01:16:21.691
Yeah, the drop is up 32%
on those 58 machines.

01:16:21.692 --> 01:16:24.277
<i>It's gonna make your
bottom line about 250.</i>

01:16:24.278 --> 01:16:26.229
<i>Right.</i>

01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:28.447
Okay.

01:16:28.448 --> 01:16:30.499
I got an mba for this.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.369
That's what this
business has come to...

01:16:33.370 --> 01:16:35.254
Cost-analyzing
every slot machine.

01:16:35.255 --> 01:16:38.174
What's an mba?

01:16:38.175 --> 01:16:39.908
An mba is a degree...

01:16:39.909 --> 01:16:42.845
Zack, you in here?
Yeah.

01:16:42.846 --> 01:16:44.764
Excuse me.

01:16:44.765 --> 01:16:47.450
Hey, hey, hey.
What's going on?

01:16:47.451 --> 01:16:50.553
I ever hear this again
you're out of here.

01:16:50.554 --> 01:16:52.688
- Zack, nothing happened.
- Yeah, something happened.

01:16:52.689 --> 01:16:54.540
She's jumping to conclusions.

01:16:54.541 --> 01:16:56.809
If that happens again
to anybody,

01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:59.545
You're gonna jump
to your conclusion

01:16:59.546 --> 01:17:01.614
without your golden parachute.

01:17:01.615 --> 01:17:04.500
You owe her an apology.

01:17:07.471 --> 01:17:11.057
Nomi, I'm sorry.
I apologize.

01:17:11.058 --> 01:17:14.243
Yeah, fine. Okay.

01:17:16.513 --> 01:17:18.631
- Get out of here.
- Yeah.

01:17:18.632 --> 01:17:21.467
Give me some juice
on three and four.

01:17:21.468 --> 01:17:24.470
An MBA's a degree
you pick up in college.

01:17:24.471 --> 01:17:27.306
It's mostly worthless
in the real world.

01:17:27.307 --> 01:17:29.475
<i>Let's get
an audio check.</i>

01:17:29.476 --> 01:17:31.644
You go for it, don't you?

01:17:31.645 --> 01:17:34.847
Yeah, I try to.

01:17:37.567 --> 01:17:39.635
Showtime.

01:17:39.636 --> 01:17:41.070
That's for sure.

01:17:41.071 --> 01:17:44.724
Bring both of those back up.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:53.632
Phil, you dumb fuck, get
back up here, would you?

01:17:54.601 --> 01:17:56.752
I know. I know.

01:18:04.544 --> 01:18:07.179
I want to thank you
for looking out for me.

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.765
So nice of you
to recommend me to Phil.

01:18:09.766 --> 01:18:13.269
What are friends for?

01:18:13.270 --> 01:18:15.471
Right.

01:18:20.077 --> 01:18:22.778
Molly, you were right
about the convention.

01:18:24.231 --> 01:18:26.132
Ooh! Sweet baby.

01:18:26.133 --> 01:18:29.969
Do that again, I'll break
your fucking fingers.

01:18:29.970 --> 01:18:32.505
I can't help it you don't
have a gay partner.

01:18:32.506 --> 01:18:33.739
Fuck you.

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.776
He wants everybody to
see how hetero he is.

01:18:36.777 --> 01:18:38.477
Molly, bring your flashlight.

01:18:38.478 --> 01:18:40.212
I want to see how big it is.

01:18:40.213 --> 01:18:42.515
You want a knuckle sandwich?

01:18:42.516 --> 01:18:44.483
Aw, can I have
mine anally, please?

01:18:44.484 --> 01:18:46.485
Come on, you guys,
stop. Jesus!

01:18:46.486 --> 01:18:49.188
<i>Is everybody here?
Let's line it up.</i>

01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:51.057
What are you looking at, bitch?

01:18:51.058 --> 01:18:53.626
All right, let's go.
Let's move it. Go, go, go!

01:19:32.265 --> 01:19:34.583
Oh, my god.

01:19:50.450 --> 01:19:53.502
Whoa!

01:19:58.074 --> 01:20:02.878
Oh, my god.
Are you okay, Annie?

01:20:18.695 --> 01:20:22.698
- Don't move.
- Is it broken?

01:20:22.699 --> 01:20:24.567
It's my leg or something.

01:20:24.568 --> 01:20:26.268
Tell me when
you feel something.

01:20:26.269 --> 01:20:28.804
- Ah!
- It's her knee.

01:20:28.805 --> 01:20:30.873
It isn't broken, is it?

01:20:30.874 --> 01:20:32.541
Daryl, what happened?

01:20:32.542 --> 01:20:34.710
My foot went out from under me.

01:20:34.711 --> 01:20:36.612
Hey!

01:20:36.613 --> 01:20:38.714
This is what happened.

01:20:40.383 --> 01:20:42.751
I wonder how those
got up there.

01:20:42.752 --> 01:20:45.488
They probably
came off a costume.

01:20:45.489 --> 01:20:48.057
We're gonna take you
to the hospital.

01:20:48.058 --> 01:20:53.162
- Shit, no!
- Jesus. Poor Annie. Tough break.

01:20:53.163 --> 01:20:55.431
Let us through here, please.

01:20:58.385 --> 01:21:00.236
Okay, see you later.

01:21:00.237 --> 01:21:03.305
<i>I'm the producer.
It's my show.</i>

01:21:03.306 --> 01:21:05.674
I hired your show. You're my producer.
You'll do what I say.

01:21:05.675 --> 01:21:07.443
She was my understudy.
I want a voice in this.

01:21:07.444 --> 01:21:10.345
<i>You can have
a voice in this...</i>

01:21:10.346 --> 01:21:12.748
It is broken, kids.

01:21:12.749 --> 01:21:15.350
Shit. That'll
be three months.

01:21:15.351 --> 01:21:17.786
At least.

01:21:17.787 --> 01:21:20.539
Bad karma, huh?

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:23.492
Nomi, your mother's
waiting for you.

01:21:23.493 --> 01:21:24.827
My mother?

01:21:24.828 --> 01:21:28.697
Well, for your sake,
I hope she's not.

01:21:28.698 --> 01:21:32.551
<i>If a light sleeper can
sleep with a light on,</i>

01:21:32.552 --> 01:21:35.170
<i>Can a hard sleeper
sleep with a hard-on?</i>

01:21:35.171 --> 01:21:39.241
What do you call a tiger?
A tiger's a big pussy...

01:21:39.242 --> 01:21:41.544
Henry!

01:21:43.313 --> 01:21:47.516
I can get shit on, but I
don't like getting spit on.

01:21:47.517 --> 01:21:51.203
- Hi.
- Hi, al.

01:21:51.204 --> 01:21:52.738
You look like shit.

01:21:52.739 --> 01:21:57.343
She looks better than a 10-inch
dick, and you know it.

01:21:57.344 --> 01:22:00.195
So, you like it here?

01:22:00.196 --> 01:22:02.331
What, you think she's gonna miss you?

01:22:02.332 --> 01:22:05.751
Yeah, why not?
We miss her.

01:22:05.752 --> 01:22:08.621
She misses us like
that lump on my twat.

01:22:08.622 --> 01:22:11.907
- I had taken off last week.
- Oh, Jesus, Henry.

01:22:19.616 --> 01:22:22.651
I saw the show.

01:22:22.652 --> 01:22:24.970
You were good.

01:22:26.389 --> 01:22:28.290
Thank you, al.

01:22:32.529 --> 01:22:34.363
Real good.

01:22:36.866 --> 01:22:39.735
You take care, kid.

01:22:45.875 --> 01:22:48.744
Must be weird not having
anybody come on you.

01:22:54.784 --> 01:22:57.670
Nomi. You want a ride?

01:23:00.289 --> 01:23:03.225
- I got one.
- Okay, good night.

01:23:05.562 --> 01:23:07.613
Wait.

01:23:09.549 --> 01:23:13.619
- You ever been in one of these?
- No.

01:23:13.620 --> 01:23:15.788
I always wanted one.

01:23:18.258 --> 01:23:20.876
- Some car, isn't it?
- It doesn't suck.

01:23:20.877 --> 01:23:23.662
All right.
Where we headed?

01:23:23.663 --> 01:23:26.315
You have to give me directions.

01:23:26.316 --> 01:23:28.384
To your place.

01:23:47.503 --> 01:23:49.338
Do you like Cristal?

01:23:49.339 --> 01:23:52.358
I like a lot of different champagnes,

01:23:52.359 --> 01:23:55.411
But I always stick
with champagne.

01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.315
What's Andrew Carver like?

01:24:00.316 --> 01:24:03.185
You nervous?
Don't be.

01:24:03.186 --> 01:24:05.320
I'm not.

01:24:09.576 --> 01:24:12.461
I liked it when you came.

01:24:15.364 --> 01:24:17.416
I liked your eyes.

01:25:18.294 --> 01:25:20.195
Mmm. Oh!

01:27:28.557 --> 01:27:31.660
Hey, stay with me.

01:27:31.661 --> 01:27:33.912
I'll drive you back
in the morning.

01:27:33.913 --> 01:27:36.365
It is morning.

01:27:36.366 --> 01:27:39.585
- Please.
- I've got a taxi coming.

01:27:39.586 --> 01:27:41.703
Send it back.

01:27:46.459 --> 01:27:49.544
Cristal needs a new understudy.

01:27:49.545 --> 01:27:52.514
There's an audition at noon.

01:27:52.515 --> 01:27:54.967
You want to try?

01:27:54.968 --> 01:27:56.969
Would you have told me about it

01:27:56.970 --> 01:27:58.804
if I hadn't come here?

01:27:58.805 --> 01:28:01.640
It wasn't my idea to come here.
It was yours.

01:28:06.145 --> 01:28:08.780
I want to see you again.

01:28:08.781 --> 01:28:11.483
We'll see how it goes.

01:28:14.988 --> 01:28:17.072
What, the audition?

01:28:26.966 --> 01:28:29.401
$10.50.

01:28:29.402 --> 01:28:31.803
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

01:28:37.844 --> 01:28:39.911
Hello.

01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:43.782
Mmm. I hate you.

01:28:43.783 --> 01:28:46.785
- Who was he?
- Zack.

01:28:46.786 --> 01:28:50.756
Oh, my god.
Did you tie him up?

01:28:50.757 --> 01:28:53.225
- Oh, shit.
- What?

01:28:53.226 --> 01:28:55.410
I forgot to untie him.

01:28:59.148 --> 01:29:00.648
Are you high?

01:29:00.649 --> 01:29:02.834
Maybe a little.

01:29:02.835 --> 01:29:05.804
Oh. I can't go
to sleep now.

01:29:05.805 --> 01:29:09.307
I've got an audition at noon.
Where are the sugar snaps?

01:29:09.308 --> 01:29:13.679
In the cupboard.
Nomi, don't get sucked into it.

01:29:16.015 --> 01:29:18.684
Uh-oh. Look
what I found.

01:29:20.953 --> 01:29:23.188
Okay, whatever, Nomes.

01:29:52.969 --> 01:29:54.553
Julie.

01:29:54.554 --> 01:29:57.639
- She's not hot enough.
- She's got it down.

01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.874
You can teach them
to get it down.

01:29:59.875 --> 01:30:01.893
She doesn't have Cristal's heat.

01:30:01.894 --> 01:30:04.396
None of them have Cristal's heat.

01:30:04.397 --> 01:30:06.732
I do love you, Gay.

01:30:06.733 --> 01:30:09.017
Nomi's got heat.

01:30:09.018 --> 01:30:11.486
Does she now?

01:30:11.487 --> 01:30:13.438
<i>Yes, she does.</i>

01:30:13.439 --> 01:30:17.109
In a totally different
way, of course.

01:30:17.110 --> 01:30:20.495
Come on! She's
gonna take the lead?

01:30:20.496 --> 01:30:23.615
This is a hotel show.
This isn't the Cheetah.

01:30:23.616 --> 01:30:25.534
Nobody's gonna take
my lead anyway, darlin'.

01:30:25.535 --> 01:30:27.619
I haven't missed a
show in eight years.

01:30:27.620 --> 01:30:30.405
You're not getting any
younger, darlin'.

01:30:30.406 --> 01:30:33.408
- Eat me.
- You want to do it again with just Nomi?

01:30:33.409 --> 01:30:36.077
- No.
- Yeah, I do. Set it up, Marty.

01:30:36.078 --> 01:30:39.681
This is bullshit.
It's about your dick.

01:30:39.682 --> 01:30:41.133
Nicky, Julie, thank you.

01:30:41.134 --> 01:30:43.435
What do we know about her?

01:30:43.436 --> 01:30:45.887
Nothing.
I'm not even sure she gave us

01:30:45.888 --> 01:30:48.023
- the right social security number.
- Find out, would you?

01:30:48.024 --> 01:30:49.724
- Find out what?
- Everything.

01:31:02.705 --> 01:31:05.957
You fucked her, didn't you?

01:31:05.958 --> 01:31:08.710
That piss you off because
you're jealous, Cris,

01:31:08.711 --> 01:31:12.798
or because I beat you to the punch?

01:31:33.569 --> 01:31:37.072
You fuck him for the spot
or because you wanted to?

01:31:40.743 --> 01:31:42.744
I say you did it for the spot.

01:31:42.745 --> 01:31:46.281
Is that what you did, Cristal?

01:31:46.282 --> 01:31:48.750
You don't want to piss me off

01:31:48.751 --> 01:31:51.019
now that we're friends.

01:31:51.020 --> 01:31:53.555
No, you shouldn't get pissed off.

01:31:53.556 --> 01:31:56.158
It makes you look older.

01:32:00.663 --> 01:32:03.832
- <i>Nomi.</i>
- Yeah?

01:32:03.833 --> 01:32:06.134
You got it.

01:32:06.135 --> 01:32:08.603
- I do?
- Yeah.

01:32:08.604 --> 01:32:11.022
Marty and Gay are gonna work with you.

01:32:11.023 --> 01:32:14.676
We'll get some glossies taken.
You did good.

01:32:14.677 --> 01:32:16.645
I'll call you for dinner.

01:32:16.646 --> 01:32:19.381
We'll have some lobster.
Did you ever hear Caesar sing?

01:32:19.382 --> 01:32:21.082
You'll love it.

01:32:31.294 --> 01:32:33.461
What?

01:32:34.664 --> 01:32:38.200
Congratulations. I see
you have many talents.

01:32:38.201 --> 01:32:40.902
I thought she did good.

01:33:01.607 --> 01:33:04.693
I didn't even know about the audition

01:33:04.694 --> 01:33:06.745
until afterwards.

01:33:09.248 --> 01:33:11.783
Do you like my nails?

01:33:23.629 --> 01:33:25.764
Not as nice as yours.

01:33:29.702 --> 01:33:33.722
Maybe I'll help you
with yours sometime.

01:33:37.176 --> 01:33:39.577
If you want.

01:33:42.515 --> 01:33:45.684
Isn't that nice of you, darlin'?

01:33:45.685 --> 01:33:48.253
What are friends for?

01:33:55.611 --> 01:34:00.015
On second thought...

01:34:00.016 --> 01:34:02.484
I'm not sure I want you to do mine.

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.389
I'm getting a little too
old for that whorey look.

01:34:08.524 --> 01:34:12.460
I'll think about it.

01:34:12.461 --> 01:34:14.562
Okay.

01:34:14.563 --> 01:34:17.515
Close the door on your way out.

01:35:08.818 --> 01:35:11.986
<i>You gotta be shitting me!
This is bullshit!</i>

01:35:11.987 --> 01:35:15.173
Hey, bring on the real dancers!

01:35:22.865 --> 01:35:26.868
You suck! Get off the stage!
Shit! Get off there!

01:35:26.869 --> 01:35:30.171
<i>All right! All right!
Enough of this stuff.</i>

01:35:30.172 --> 01:35:32.507
<i>Let's dance!</i>

01:35:40.433 --> 01:35:42.350
Hey!

01:35:42.351 --> 01:35:46.554
- Hey.
- I loved it. It was good.

01:35:46.555 --> 01:35:48.490
What are you doing here... slumming?

01:35:48.491 --> 01:35:50.592
- Heather!
- Hope!

01:35:50.593 --> 01:35:52.644
Were we good?

01:35:52.645 --> 01:35:54.112
You were great.

01:35:54.113 --> 01:35:56.448
She dances like a truck.

01:35:56.449 --> 01:35:57.732
I do not!

01:35:57.733 --> 01:35:59.551
Do you want something to drink?

01:35:59.552 --> 01:36:01.753
Yeah, get me a beer, bitch.

01:36:01.754 --> 01:36:04.856
Look what I got.

01:36:06.225 --> 01:36:07.625
It's beautiful.

01:36:07.626 --> 01:36:10.128
I stole it from my grandmother.

01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:13.765
You did not!
You got it at a pawn shop.

01:36:22.558 --> 01:36:26.227
We're getting married.

01:36:26.228 --> 01:36:28.196
You love her?

01:36:29.315 --> 01:36:32.150
I don't know.
She's having a baby.

01:36:36.405 --> 01:36:38.206
What about this?

01:36:38.207 --> 01:36:40.542
We ain't any good.
You heard them.

01:36:40.543 --> 01:36:43.411
"Get outta here!
Get off the stage!"

01:36:45.247 --> 01:36:48.666
What are you gonna do?

01:36:48.667 --> 01:36:52.286
Work in a grocery store.
Her mother owns it.

01:36:52.287 --> 01:36:55.757
We'll get a discount on baby food.

01:37:07.353 --> 01:37:09.337
See ya.

01:37:12.441 --> 01:37:15.326
Shit happens, you know?
Life sucks.

01:37:15.327 --> 01:37:17.529
I'm a student of t-shirts.

01:37:28.424 --> 01:37:30.508
Hey, Nicky.

01:37:56.719 --> 01:37:58.720
Hey, excuse me.
Wait! You cannot go...

01:37:58.721 --> 01:38:00.605
What's going on?

01:38:00.606 --> 01:38:02.240
What do you mean
"what's going on?"

01:38:02.241 --> 01:38:03.741
Hey, cool it, all right?

01:38:03.742 --> 01:38:07.045
Cool it? You told me I got
it, then sent me this?

01:38:07.046 --> 01:38:09.998
I didn't have a choice. She threatened
to walk, got her lawyers into it.

01:38:09.999 --> 01:38:14.235
- So what?
- So she's a star. You're not worth it.

01:38:14.236 --> 01:38:18.273
I'm sorry, Nomi.
I tried. Fuck!

01:38:18.274 --> 01:38:21.175
So basically, my g-string snapped.

01:38:21.176 --> 01:38:24.379
So there I was, dancing butt
naked for five minutes.

01:38:24.380 --> 01:38:26.447
I mean, my poor partner.

01:38:28.250 --> 01:38:32.987
Hey... I thought
about it, darlin'.

01:38:32.988 --> 01:38:35.857
You think you could do my nails now?

01:38:39.762 --> 01:38:43.064
Oh, okay.

01:38:43.065 --> 01:38:45.266
<i>Maybe some other time.</i>

01:40:56.398 --> 01:40:59.467
Come on...
Slave girl.

01:41:02.788 --> 01:41:05.973
- Ha ha ha!
- Let's go, go!

01:41:07.542 --> 01:41:11.729
Run, run, run! Go, run, run, run!
Go, go, run!

01:41:11.730 --> 01:41:14.265
<i>Go, go, run, go!</i>

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:19.287
Aah.

01:41:19.288 --> 01:41:21.022
<i>You guys, let me through!</i>

01:41:21.023 --> 01:41:24.492
- Oh, my god!
- Shit!

01:41:24.493 --> 01:41:26.260
Cristal, can you hear me?

01:41:27.529 --> 01:41:29.447
Somebody get Marty here!

01:41:29.448 --> 01:41:30.965
<i>Marty!</i>

01:41:34.369 --> 01:41:37.171
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

01:41:37.172 --> 01:41:39.207
Somebody get an ambulance now!

01:41:39.208 --> 01:41:40.475
Who was behind her?

01:41:40.476 --> 01:41:44.445
- I was.
- What happened?

01:41:44.446 --> 01:41:48.466
I don't know.
She just went down.

01:41:48.467 --> 01:41:51.302
She slipped.
I saw it.

01:41:53.756 --> 01:41:56.057
Nomi wasn't even close to her.

01:42:12.291 --> 01:42:14.375
Tough break, huh?

01:42:17.045 --> 01:42:20.915
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

01:42:38.150 --> 01:42:40.735
Mm-hmm.

01:42:40.736 --> 01:42:43.855
All right, thanks.
Keep me informed.

01:42:43.856 --> 01:42:45.773
Well, she's got a concussion.

01:42:45.774 --> 01:42:47.408
That'll be all right.

01:42:47.409 --> 01:42:50.311
But she's got a compound
fracture of the right hip.

01:42:50.312 --> 01:42:54.148
You know how long
those take to heal?

01:42:54.149 --> 01:42:55.950
We got to shut the show down.

01:42:55.951 --> 01:42:59.170
Not a chance.
The show goes on.

01:42:59.171 --> 01:43:02.757
The Stardust is never dark.
It's never been.

01:43:02.758 --> 01:43:06.460
It never will be,
not while I'm alive.

01:43:06.461 --> 01:43:08.179
Who was her understudy?

01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:10.498
Well, we had a girl who...

01:43:12.500 --> 01:43:15.169
- What's funny?
- Cristal Connors is a star, Sam.

01:43:15.170 --> 01:43:17.388
You can't just replace her.

01:43:22.744 --> 01:43:25.630
What if we could we just bring
somebody in while she's recuperating?

01:43:25.631 --> 01:43:28.682
- She could be out a year.
- Like who?

01:43:28.683 --> 01:43:30.701
Janet Jackson.
Paula Abdul.

01:43:30.702 --> 01:43:32.870
Paula Abdul.
In my show?

01:43:32.871 --> 01:43:35.039
We're not gonna pay
those kinds of salaries.

01:43:35.040 --> 01:43:37.875
In that case,

01:43:37.876 --> 01:43:39.794
We do what we do in Vegas.

01:43:39.795 --> 01:43:42.696
- What?
- We gamble.

01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.985
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:43:47.986 --> 01:43:50.087
<i>The Stardust proudly presents...</i>

01:43:50.088 --> 01:43:52.657
<i>Miss Nomi Malone!</i>

01:44:59.441 --> 01:45:03.494
We could've brought anyone into this
show... Janet Jackson, Paula Abdul.

01:45:03.495 --> 01:45:07.431
Nomi Malone is what
Las Vegas is all about.

01:45:07.432 --> 01:45:10.101
She's dazzling, she's exciting,

01:45:10.102 --> 01:45:14.772
- And very, very sexy. Thank you, Zack.
- Yes, sir.

01:45:14.773 --> 01:45:17.808
Miss Malone, how did you
feel about the show tonight?

01:45:17.809 --> 01:45:20.745
I just hope I can be
as good as the show.

01:45:20.746 --> 01:45:22.880
You are, my dear.

01:45:22.881 --> 01:45:25.916
- You <i>are</i> the show.
- <i>Hear!</i> Hear!

01:45:25.917 --> 01:45:27.918
Miss Malone, please.

01:45:27.919 --> 01:45:29.754
<i>Come on, come on,
over here, Nomi.</i>

01:45:29.755 --> 01:45:33.124
<i>That's great, Nomi.</i>
<i>One more.</i> Please, please.

01:45:33.125 --> 01:45:35.359
<i>Congratulations, Nomi.</i>

01:45:36.928 --> 01:45:38.796
Hey, you ready to party?

01:45:38.797 --> 01:45:42.266
- Where?
- The Paradiso. I rented out the bungalows.

01:45:42.267 --> 01:45:45.369
- For what?
- For you.

01:45:45.370 --> 01:45:47.371
Yay!

01:45:47.372 --> 01:45:49.240
Hurry up.
I got a limo waiting.

01:45:49.241 --> 01:45:52.777
- I don't have anything to wear.
- Yes, you do.

01:45:52.778 --> 01:45:56.914
Andrew Carver's coming. He saw the show.
He thought you were great!

01:45:56.915 --> 01:46:00.951
Did you hear that?
Andrew Carver is gonna be there!

01:46:00.952 --> 01:46:04.488
- Yeah, I heard.
- Hey.

01:46:04.489 --> 01:46:06.857
What's wrong with you?

01:46:06.858 --> 01:46:10.177
You pushed her, didn't you?

01:46:10.178 --> 01:46:13.347
No.

01:46:13.348 --> 01:46:15.833
How can you talk that shit to me?
Julie saw it.

01:46:15.834 --> 01:46:17.702
She couldn't have seen it.

01:46:17.703 --> 01:46:21.205
I saw Julie, and her back was to you.

01:46:25.043 --> 01:46:27.178
She saw it.

01:46:29.915 --> 01:46:32.800
Wow.

01:46:32.801 --> 01:46:34.752
Okay.

01:46:34.753 --> 01:46:37.755

01:46:40.158 --> 01:46:43.894
You got to come.
Andrew's gonna be there.

01:46:43.895 --> 01:46:46.030
I don't care.

01:46:47.799 --> 01:46:50.868
Molly...

01:46:50.869 --> 01:46:53.838
It ain't a party without you.

01:46:54.973 --> 01:46:59.777

- Where are the police?

01:52:44.155 --> 01:52:46.874
- They're not here.
- Why the fuck aren't they here?

01:52:46.875 --> 01:52:48.826
Because they're not coming.

01:52:51.362 --> 01:52:53.497
<i>Don't do it...</i>

01:52:53.498 --> 01:52:55.265
Polly.

01:53:02.490 --> 01:53:04.425
How did you find out?

01:53:04.426 --> 01:53:07.928
You were busted for disturbing
the peace at the Crave Club.

01:53:07.929 --> 01:53:09.780
The police took
your fingerprints.

01:53:09.781 --> 01:53:12.649
I'm don't have to
listen to this.

01:53:12.650 --> 01:53:16.353
<i>Yes,</i> you do.

01:53:16.354 --> 01:53:19.456
Polly Ann Costello.

01:53:19.457 --> 01:53:22.659
Your father killed your
mother, then killed himself.

01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:25.646
You ran away from a foster home
in Oakland, December 1990.

01:53:25.647 --> 01:53:28.782
- Arrests... Denver, soliciting.
- Stop it!

01:53:28.783 --> 01:53:31.001
San Jose, soliciting.
Cheyenne, soliciting.

01:53:31.002 --> 01:53:35.489
Shall I read the rest of them, huh?
Possession of crack cocaine.

01:53:35.490 --> 01:53:38.559
Assault with a deadly weapon.

01:53:38.560 --> 01:53:42.229
Tell me something...
why did you stop hooking?

01:53:42.230 --> 01:53:44.932
You had your future pretty
well mapped out for yourself.

01:53:46.734 --> 01:53:50.170
I did what I had to do.

01:53:50.171 --> 01:53:52.639
Just like you did with Cristal.

01:53:54.242 --> 01:53:57.494
I'm not a whore.

01:53:59.180 --> 01:54:02.850
No, you're not.

01:54:02.851 --> 01:54:07.454
You're gonna be a big star.

01:54:07.455 --> 01:54:10.290
Your face is gonna
be up on billboards.

01:54:10.291 --> 01:54:13.894
And you're gonna make a lot
of money for the Stardust.

01:54:29.310 --> 01:54:32.679
You're not gonna let
them get away with this.

01:54:32.680 --> 01:54:35.199
Andrew Carver is at the
paradiso this year.

01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:38.151
But he might be at the
Riviera next year

01:54:38.152 --> 01:54:41.238
or the Stardust the year after...
he's part of a team. So are you.

01:54:44.292 --> 01:54:46.410
What about Molly?

01:54:46.411 --> 01:54:49.195
You like her? I'll make sure
he gives her enough money.

01:54:49.196 --> 01:54:51.315
She can have a dress shop.

01:54:54.135 --> 01:54:57.137
Tell me something.

01:54:57.138 --> 01:54:59.223
What did you charge?

01:55:01.092 --> 01:55:02.643
Hooking.

01:55:07.148 --> 01:55:09.049
$50.

01:55:09.050 --> 01:55:11.585
$100 sometimes.

01:55:11.586 --> 01:55:14.071
You got low self-esteem, baby.

01:55:14.072 --> 01:55:15.689
You're a fantastic fuck.

01:55:25.583 --> 01:55:28.201
I was paying you a compliment.

01:56:03.104 --> 01:56:05.238
It's showtime.

01:56:18.086 --> 01:56:20.671
Andrew Carver, please.

01:56:26.995 --> 01:56:29.146
- Hello, baby.
- Hi.

01:56:29.147 --> 01:56:32.532
- Lookin' good. He's ready for you.
- Thank you.

01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:48.115
Didn't take you long.

01:56:48.116 --> 01:56:50.550
No.

01:56:57.625 --> 01:56:59.710
I like you better topless.

01:57:01.012 --> 01:57:04.097
Wait till you see me bottomless.

01:57:08.936 --> 01:57:10.837
I'm waiting.

01:57:46.107 --> 01:57:48.208
Take the rest off.

01:57:49.811 --> 01:57:51.845
Sure.

01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:01.555
Next time
I'll fucking kill you!

01:58:01.556 --> 01:58:04.191
Okay.
Okay, okay.

01:58:08.096 --> 01:58:09.730
Oh, man, no.

01:58:18.906 --> 01:58:21.541
Fucker!
Fuck off!

01:58:32.053 --> 01:58:34.888
He says he wants to sleep.

01:58:34.889 --> 01:58:37.491
- Tired him out, huh?
- Yeah.

01:58:53.841 --> 01:58:57.144
She's still out.
It's the medication.

01:58:59.113 --> 01:59:01.081
Is she okay?

01:59:01.082 --> 01:59:02.682
She's okay.

01:59:14.028 --> 01:59:17.063
Molly, Molly.

01:59:24.939 --> 01:59:27.941
I just went to Carver.

01:59:27.942 --> 01:59:31.044
I kicked the shit out of him.

01:59:35.783 --> 01:59:38.051
I love you.

01:59:50.064 --> 01:59:52.032
Cristal Connors, please.

01:59:52.033 --> 01:59:53.900
Room 319.

02:00:01.876 --> 02:00:05.879
<i>You know the best advice
I ever gave you?</i>

02:00:05.880 --> 02:00:08.114
If you're the only one
left standing up there...

02:00:08.115 --> 02:00:10.917
They'll hire you.

02:00:10.918 --> 02:00:12.736
Thank you,

02:00:12.737 --> 02:00:15.205
and good night,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:00:15.206 --> 02:00:18.992
Cristal has left the building.

02:00:20.244 --> 02:00:21.828
I'm sorry, Cristal.

02:00:21.829 --> 02:00:25.832
Yeah, I know just
how sorry you are.

02:00:28.302 --> 02:00:32.289
How do you think
I got my first lead?

02:00:33.824 --> 02:00:36.726
There's always someone
younger and hungrier

02:00:36.727 --> 02:00:40.830
coming down the stairs after you.

02:00:40.831 --> 02:00:43.066
Why didn't you tell anyone?

02:00:43.067 --> 02:00:45.735
Oh, hell, darlin'.

02:00:45.736 --> 02:00:48.154
I needed a rest.

02:00:48.155 --> 02:00:52.275
Besides my lawyers got me
a real nice settlement.

02:00:55.546 --> 02:00:58.315
- I gotta go.
- Aren't you gonna come here

02:00:58.316 --> 02:01:00.700
and give me a big kiss?

02:01:39.006 --> 02:01:41.207
Bye, darlin'.

02:01:47.815 --> 02:01:50.050
Bye, darlin'.

02:02:10.471 --> 02:02:13.073
<i>Come on, hurry up!</i>

02:02:21.148 --> 02:02:24.617
Hop in, pard.
This here's your lucky day.

02:02:25.619 --> 02:02:27.887
Right.

02:02:30.491 --> 02:02:32.625
Let's go.

02:02:39.467 --> 02:02:41.518
So did you gamble?

02:02:44.438 --> 02:02:46.389
Did you win?

02:02:49.226 --> 02:02:52.562
What'd you win?

02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:57.734
Me.

02:02:57.735 --> 02:02:59.703
Oh, fuck.

02:02:59.704 --> 02:03:01.204
It's you.

02:03:01.205 --> 02:03:05.291
I want my fucking suitcase...

02:03:05.292 --> 02:03:07.327
- Asshole!
- Hey, wait a minute!

02:03:07.328 --> 02:03:10.163
I'm driving here!
Jesus fuckin' Christ!

02:03:10.164 --> 02:03:12.165
- Watch the fuckin' road!
- Be cool, be cool.

02:03:12.166 --> 02:03:15.034
I'll get your suitcase,
all right?
