02:14.886 --> 02:18.223
Praise to you, Lord Jesus Christ.

02:32.904 --> 02:36.241
<i>1633,</i> pax Christi,

02:36.324 --> 02:38.076
<i>praised be God.</i>

02:39.786 --> 02:41.496
<i>Although for us,</i>

02:41.579 --> 02:43.748
<i>there is little peace in this land now.</i>

02:45.083 --> 02:48.253
<i>I never knew Japan when it was
a country of light,</i>

02:48.336 --> 02:51.297
<i>but I have never known it
to be as dark as it is now.</i>

02:52.549 --> 02:54.133
<i>All our progress has ended.</i>

02:54.217 --> 02:57.720
<i>A new persecution, new repression,</i>

02:57.804 --> 02:59.097
<i>new suffering.</i>

03:01.683 --> 03:07.021
<i>They use ladles filled with holes,
so the drops would come out slowly</i>

03:07.105 --> 03:09.566
<i>and the pain would be prolonged.</i>

03:09.941 --> 03:12.110
<i>Each small splash of the water</i>

03:12.944 --> 03:15.196
<i>was like a burning coal.</i>

03:18.950 --> 03:21.452
<i>The Governor of Nagasaki
took four friars</i>

03:21.703 --> 03:24.289
<i>and one of our own society to Unzen.</i>

03:25.790 --> 03:27.667
<i>There are hot springs there.</i>

03:28.960 --> 03:34.132
<i>The Japanese call them "hells,"
partly, I think, in mockery</i>

03:34.215 --> 03:38.052
<i>and partly, I must tell you, in truth.</i>

03:45.685 --> 03:47.562
<i>The officials told our</i> padres

03:47.645 --> 03:50.857
<i>to abandon God
and the gospel of His love.</i>

03:52.066 --> 03:55.486
<i>But they not only refused to apostatize,</i>

03:55.570 --> 03:58.364
<i>they asked to be tortured,</i>

03:58.448 --> 04:01.284
<i>so they could demonstrate
the strength of their faith</i>

04:01.367 --> 04:03.411
<i>and the presence of God within them.</i>

04:06.122 --> 04:10.001
<i>Some remained on the mountain
for 33 days.</i>

04:14.464 --> 04:16.758
<i>The story of their courage</i>

04:16.841 --> 04:20.511
<i>gives hope to those of us priests
who remain here in secret.</i>

04:21.346 --> 04:24.098
<i>We will not abandon
our hidden Christians</i>

04:25.141 --> 04:26.976
<i>- who live in fear.</i>
- "...who live in fear."

04:29.145 --> 04:32.690
<i>We only grow stronger in His love.</i>

04:38.196 --> 04:41.157
<i>FERREIRA is lost to us.</i>

04:45.703 --> 04:47.914
This was his last letter.

04:50.208 --> 04:51.876
Why lost?

04:52.919 --> 04:55.505
This letter came to us
when we were traveling from Portugal.

04:55.588 --> 04:57.632
It took years to reach us.

04:57.715 --> 05:00.426
It was hidden, smuggled, ransomed.

05:00.510 --> 05:03.346
Finally, put into my hand
by a Dutch trader,

05:04.722 --> 05:06.891
who had other news as well.

05:09.394 --> 05:10.728
He's alive?

05:12.772 --> 05:14.774
That he apostatized,

05:15.858 --> 05:20.238
that he denounced God in public
and surrendered the faith,

05:20.697 --> 05:22.740
and is now living as a Japanese.

05:28.538 --> 05:30.039
That's not possible.

05:31.874 --> 05:35.294
Father FERREIRA risked his life
to spread our faith all over Japan.

05:36.337 --> 05:38.047
We're here today because of him.

05:38.756 --> 05:39.882
Yes. He was...

05:39.966 --> 05:41.884
He's the strongest of us.

05:42.343 --> 05:46.389
<i>He wrote those words during
the most sweeping persecution of all.</i>

05:46.472 --> 05:48.725
<i>Now, things are even worse.</i>

05:48.808 --> 05:52.729
<i>Thousands are dead
because of what we brought them.</i>

05:53.104 --> 05:55.606
<i>Thousands more
have given up the faith.</i>

05:57.233 --> 06:01.112
You said this trader brought news,
but it's not proven, is it?

06:01.195 --> 06:05.908
It could be a slander created
to further discredit our faith.

06:05.992 --> 06:09.162
Given the extent of the persecution
in that country...

06:09.245 --> 06:11.205
Yes. But, respectfully,
there must be multitudes there

06:11.289 --> 06:13.082
- who need us, too.
- And the fact,

06:13.499 --> 06:15.084
there has been no other word of him,

06:15.168 --> 06:16.878
and the news brought by the Dutch...

06:16.961 --> 06:18.379
Rumor, Father, only.

06:18.463 --> 06:21.799
I must conclude it is true.

06:24.635 --> 06:26.679
If it is true, Father,

06:27.513 --> 06:30.641
what would it mean

06:31.976 --> 06:33.394
for the Jesuits?

06:33.519 --> 06:35.521
For the whole of Catholic Europe?

06:36.647 --> 06:40.026
It seems to me that our mission here
is more urgent than ever.

06:40.109 --> 06:42.653
We must go find Father FERREIRA.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.158
I cannot allow that.

06:50.953 --> 06:54.082
How... How can we
abandon our mission?

06:54.165 --> 06:57.126
Your mission, Father Garupe,
was to find word of FERREIRA.

06:57.210 --> 06:58.628
You have found it.

07:00.379 --> 07:01.464
Excuse me, Father,

07:01.547 --> 07:05.009
but this letter
relates the most terrible history,

07:05.093 --> 07:07.929
but it says nothing of FERREIRA himself.

07:08.012 --> 07:09.680
Whatever happened to him
is still unknown.

07:10.640 --> 07:12.975
All that we know of his fate,

07:13.059 --> 07:15.520
is this one slander.

07:17.146 --> 07:19.816
Permit me, Father VALIGNANO, but...

07:20.691 --> 07:24.570
I... I believe our mission still stands.

07:30.034 --> 07:35.206
Do you know how many Christians
the authorities executed in Shimabara?

07:35.706 --> 07:36.707
Thousands.

07:36.791 --> 07:38.543
Tens of thousands,

07:38.626 --> 07:40.044
most of them beheaded.

07:40.378 --> 07:41.963
No, it's far too dangerous for you.

07:42.046 --> 07:43.464
Yes, but, Father,

07:43.548 --> 07:46.092
how do we neglect the man
that nurtured us in the faith?

07:46.717 --> 07:48.886
He shaped the world for us.

07:49.095 --> 07:50.763
And even if the slander should be true,

07:50.847 --> 07:52.598
then Father FERREIRA is damned.

07:52.682 --> 07:53.933
Yes.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.435
We have no choice, but to save his soul.

07:58.855 --> 08:01.149
This is in your hearts, then?
Both of you?

08:01.232 --> 08:02.400
- Yes.
- It is.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.610
Like our first fervor.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.285
Then I must trust God has put it there.

08:14.453 --> 08:17.248
He calls you to a great trial.

08:17.373 --> 08:20.501
The moment you set foot in that country,

08:20.585 --> 08:22.545
you step into high danger.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.966
You will be the last two priests to go.

08:27.425 --> 08:28.926
<i>An army of two.</i>

08:32.722 --> 08:34.849
<i>May 25th, 1640.</i>

08:34.932 --> 08:36.142
Pax Christi...

08:36.225 --> 08:38.019
<i>God be praised.</i>

08:38.102 --> 08:40.521
<i>Father VALIGNANO, as I begin these lines,</i>

08:40.605 --> 08:42.190
<i>I cannot be sure
that when they are done</i>

08:42.273 --> 08:43.608
<i>they will ever reach you.</i>

08:44.442 --> 08:46.944
<i>But I want to maintain
your confidence in our mission</i>

08:47.987 --> 08:50.406
<i>and vindicate your faith in us.</i>

08:50.489 --> 08:51.657
Careful.

08:51.741 --> 08:54.035
<i>Today, there was wonderful news.</i>

08:54.118 --> 08:57.330
<i>Your Mr. Chun
has found us a Chinese boat.</i>

08:57.413 --> 08:59.832
<i>It will smuggle us into Japan.</i>

08:59.916 --> 09:03.961
<i>And he claims he's found
the only Japanese in Macau,</i>

09:04.462 --> 09:07.006
<i>to be our most valued guide
in that country.</i>

09:07.089 --> 09:08.633
Come on, this way.

09:18.643 --> 09:22.230
<i>Finally, we meet our first Japanese.</i>

09:22.313 --> 09:24.941
He's not much, you will see.

09:25.024 --> 09:28.152
But after almost two months,
he's the only one.

09:42.458 --> 09:43.501
Hey.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.212
Hey, wake up.

09:47.797 --> 09:49.548
Come on, get up.

09:56.472 --> 09:59.225
He was drifting on sea,
Portuguese bring him.

10:00.184 --> 10:03.354
He's stuck here, wants to go home.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.277
Is he... Are you really Japanese?

10:10.027 --> 10:11.779
Answer them, you fool.

10:11.862 --> 10:13.489
These are <i>padres.</i>

10:15.574 --> 10:16.993
Kichijiro!

10:18.327 --> 10:20.329
You fool, they will take you home!

10:23.708 --> 10:25.209
Where is your home?

10:26.919 --> 10:28.504
Nagasaki.

10:29.714 --> 10:31.132
What's your work?

10:31.215 --> 10:33.009
He will do what you say.

10:33.384 --> 10:34.719
Fisherman.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.722
You know our language?

10:39.932 --> 10:41.100
Little.

10:41.183 --> 10:43.269
Yes. Little.

10:45.730 --> 10:47.481
You learned it from the Jesuit <i>padres.</i>

10:47.565 --> 10:50.109
You must have, so you're Christian?

10:50.526 --> 10:51.569
No!

10:52.778 --> 10:54.530
No Christian.

10:56.073 --> 10:58.909
Good guide for you. He's Christian, too.

10:59.285 --> 11:01.537
I'm not Christian!

11:02.455 --> 11:04.081
Christian die!

11:06.125 --> 11:07.585
They...

11:07.668 --> 11:09.670
They die in Nagasaki.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.300
Listen to me.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.261
We have money.

11:19.430 --> 11:21.474
If you can help us,
we can take you home.

11:21.557 --> 11:22.892
We can take you home to Japan.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.852
Would you like to go home to Japan?

11:26.062 --> 11:27.313
I want...

11:28.397 --> 11:29.648
I want to go home.

11:29.857 --> 11:31.108
Not for money.

11:32.276 --> 11:35.363
Japan is the country of my family!

11:36.697 --> 11:37.823
I beg you.

11:38.157 --> 11:39.992
Don't abandon me here, Father.

11:40.576 --> 11:41.827
Please!

11:43.871 --> 11:45.331
Take me home.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.793
He will be good guide.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.504
Promise me.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.506
- I'll clean him up.
- They take me home!

11:54.590 --> 11:55.925
Promise me.

12:08.938 --> 12:10.064
Our guide...

12:10.815 --> 12:12.525
He can't be Christian.

12:13.275 --> 12:16.445
He says he's not,
but can you believe anything he says?

12:17.655 --> 12:20.157
I don't even want to believe
he's Japanese.

12:23.702 --> 12:26.956
<i>And He said to them,
"Go ye into the whole world</i>

12:27.039 --> 12:30.209
<i>"and preach the gospel
to every living creature,</i>

12:30.292 --> 12:32.545
<i>"even to one such as this."</i>

12:33.546 --> 12:35.881
<i>So our Lord commanded,</i>

12:35.965 --> 12:39.635
<i>and as I prepare to do His work,
I see His face before me.</i>

12:41.512 --> 12:45.141
<i>He looks as He must have
when He commanded Peter,</i>

12:46.350 --> 12:47.977
<i>"Feed my lambs,</i>

12:48.060 --> 12:50.521
<i>"feed my lambs, feed my sheep."</i>

12:51.981 --> 12:54.567
<i>It fascinates me.</i>

12:54.650 --> 12:56.861
<i>I feel such great love for it.</i>

13:03.742 --> 13:07.413
<i>Garupe and I had
absolutely no luggage to bring to Japan,</i>

13:07.496 --> 13:09.331
<i>except our own hearts.</i>

13:10.040 --> 13:13.461
<i>And during the calm
and storm of the voyage,</i>

13:13.544 --> 13:16.922
<i>I reflected upon the 20 years
which has passed</i>

13:17.006 --> 13:19.508
<i>since the persecution has broken out.</i>

13:20.801 --> 13:23.012
<i>The black soil of Japan</i>

13:23.095 --> 13:26.807
<i>is filled with the wailing
of so many Christians.</i>

13:28.058 --> 13:31.520
<i>The red blood of priests
has flowed profusely.</i>

13:32.563 --> 13:35.816
<i>The walls of the churches
have fallen down.</i>

13:48.162 --> 13:49.580
<i>Shaba.</i>

14:00.883 --> 14:02.843
We've trusted that man with our lives.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.556
Jesus trusted even worse.

14:08.557 --> 14:09.892
Hurry.

14:10.893 --> 14:11.936
Come.

14:28.953 --> 14:30.579
Here, here!

14:30.663 --> 14:32.373
Kichijiro, where are you going?

14:33.874 --> 14:35.376
Kichijiro!

14:38.837 --> 14:40.714
He's going to betray us.

14:46.804 --> 14:48.097
Kichijiro!

14:58.065 --> 15:00.609
Fact is fact.
What you will do, do quickly.

15:56.457 --> 15:57.833
<i>Padre?</i>

16:10.846 --> 16:12.973
Hurry. We have no time.

16:13.057 --> 16:15.684
No time! Come, come, come.

16:18.646 --> 16:19.897
What is this place?

16:20.522 --> 16:21.899
Tomogi place.

16:22.191 --> 16:24.360
- Japan?
- Please be quick!

16:24.693 --> 16:27.946
So gentiles cannot see you. So, come.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.073
- Gentiles?
- Yes.

16:29.406 --> 16:30.866
Come, come. Quickly!

16:30.949 --> 16:32.493
Quick!

16:33.285 --> 16:34.286
Come!

16:38.123 --> 16:39.750
I'm sorry, <i>Padre.</i>

16:40.167 --> 16:45.339
Too dangerous.
There are more executions than ever.

16:45.422 --> 16:48.801
If they know we're Christian,
we will be killed.

16:48.884 --> 16:50.886
The Lord hears you.

16:51.762 --> 16:52.930
Yes.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.391
He sent you to us.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.935
Please.

17:13.617 --> 17:16.286
Please. Enter, enter.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.348
Thank you.

17:37.349 --> 17:40.352
We have little food, if you'd like.

17:42.354 --> 17:45.023
You will be safe here until morning.

17:45.816 --> 17:47.526
Sit, sit! Please.

17:49.027 --> 17:51.321
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.495
How do you live like this?

17:59.663 --> 18:02.916
I mean, how do you live as Christians

18:03.333 --> 18:06.879
when the danger is so great?

18:07.045 --> 18:09.006
You understand?

18:09.423 --> 18:11.884
We pray in secret,

18:12.009 --> 18:13.927
but we have our <i>Jiisama.</i>

18:14.344 --> 18:16.180
<i>- Jiisama?
- Jiisama.</i>

18:16.513 --> 18:17.514
<i>Jiisama.</i>

18:18.015 --> 18:19.808
Who is the <i>Jiisama?</i>

18:28.317 --> 18:29.318
You lead them?

18:29.735 --> 18:31.236
You lead the village?

18:31.361 --> 18:34.323
- In prayer, in devotions?
<i>- Padre,</i> too.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.871
<i>The only sacrament
he can perform is baptism.</i>

18:43.499 --> 18:45.876
<i>We worship with the</i> Jiisama.

18:46.543 --> 18:48.462
<i>We hide the Christian images.</i>

18:48.545 --> 18:49.755
<i>Amen.</i>

18:49.838 --> 18:51.673
But God still sees us.

18:52.216 --> 18:54.218
- Yes?
- Yes.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.054
Even though we do not have a priest

18:57.137 --> 18:58.514
until now.

19:02.351 --> 19:03.977
Please eat!

19:06.855 --> 19:08.899
Please eat.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.317
Thank you.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.583
Amen.

19:27.584 --> 19:31.171
Every Christian here
is part of our secret church.

19:32.089 --> 19:33.507
This... This faith...

19:34.591 --> 19:37.761
This faith you have is so strong.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.721
You have such courage.

19:40.722 --> 19:46.186
Is it only here that there is such faith
or in other villages, too?

19:46.603 --> 19:50.107
We do not know about other villages.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.775
We never go there.

19:52.734 --> 19:53.902
You don't go?

19:55.362 --> 19:58.365
Other villages are so dangerous.

19:58.448 --> 20:01.243
You do not know who to trust.

20:01.660 --> 20:04.621
Everyone fears the Inquisitor

20:04.705 --> 20:06.707
Inoue-<i>sama.</i>

20:07.207 --> 20:08.792
Inform on Christian,

20:08.876 --> 20:11.295
and they give you 100 pieces of silver.

20:12.880 --> 20:15.966
200 for a Christian brother.

20:16.383 --> 20:20.429
And for a priest, 300.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.306
Three hundred?

20:24.808 --> 20:26.977
You must go to the other villages.

20:28.145 --> 20:30.731
You must let them know
that priests are here again.

20:31.356 --> 20:34.818
That we are here in Japan, again,
it will be good.

20:39.489 --> 20:42.701
There was a <i>padre,</i>

20:42.993 --> 20:46.204
who was here called FERREIRA.

20:47.039 --> 20:48.749
Father FERREIRA.

20:48.832 --> 20:50.500
Have you heard of him?

20:52.210 --> 20:53.211
Like us.

20:54.338 --> 20:56.548
- No.
- No?

21:02.512 --> 21:03.680
You do not eat?

21:07.267 --> 21:11.188
It is you who feed us.

22:18.672 --> 22:21.258
<i>They do not dare take us
anywhere by the main road.</i>

22:22.300 --> 22:25.804
<i>To hide like this
must be a terrible burden.</i>

22:26.930 --> 22:30.642
<i>I was overwhelmed by the love
I felt from these people,</i>

22:30.934 --> 22:33.603
<i>even though their faces couldn't show it.</i>

22:34.688 --> 22:38.525
<i>Long years of secrecy
have made their faces into masks.</i>

22:39.693 --> 22:42.195
<i>Why do they have to suffer so much?</i>

22:43.196 --> 22:46.241
<i>Why did God make them
to bear such a burden?</i>

22:47.534 --> 22:49.494
This is the safest here.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.331
This hut for making charcoal.

22:56.043 --> 22:58.128
<i>When you hear this sound...</i>

23:01.381 --> 23:03.633
It will be us.

23:03.717 --> 23:06.178
If you hear anything else...

23:17.814 --> 23:19.149
Hide.

23:23.236 --> 23:26.198
<i>During the day, we keep the door
of our hut tightly closed</i>

23:27.324 --> 23:31.369
<i>and refrain from the slightest noise
lest anyone passing outside may hear it.</i>

23:33.663 --> 23:36.083
<i>Only the dark makes it safe for us</i>

23:36.166 --> 23:39.753
<i>to go down into the village
and minister to the faithful.</i>

23:43.924 --> 23:45.008
<i>Padre!</i>

23:46.259 --> 23:47.385
Please!

23:47.511 --> 23:50.597
<i>Finally, they had priests
to forgive their sins.</i>

23:54.267 --> 23:55.894
Bless me, <i>Padre,</i>

23:56.353 --> 23:58.355
for I have sinned.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.357
- Confession.
- I have sinned.

24:17.249 --> 24:19.292
<i>We heard their confessions all night.</i>

24:19.376 --> 24:21.169
But then, <i>Padre...</i>

24:21.253 --> 24:23.338
<i>Even though we could not
always be sure</i>

24:23.421 --> 24:24.965
<i>what was being confessed.</i>

24:28.426 --> 24:31.429
<i>And now, Christianity brought love.</i>

24:33.056 --> 24:35.267
<i>The dignity for the first time</i>

24:35.392 --> 24:38.395
<i>of being treated like
God's creatures, not animals.</i>

24:38.645 --> 24:43.233
<i>And the promise that all their suffering
would not end in nothingness,</i>

24:43.984 --> 24:46.236
<i>but in salvation.</i>

24:49.239 --> 24:51.908
<i>We offer mass in the dead of night,</i>

24:52.284 --> 24:54.494
<i>just as they did in the Catacombs.</i>

24:55.078 --> 24:56.580
<i>Quietly.</i>

24:56.663 --> 25:00.625
<i>In nomine Patris,
et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

25:01.126 --> 25:02.127
Amen.

25:27.819 --> 25:29.279
- Amen.
- Amen.

25:29.362 --> 25:30.947
- Amen.
- Amen.

25:33.491 --> 25:37.621
We now always God in <i>paraíso?</i>

25:41.041 --> 25:42.626
<i>Paraíso?</i>

25:42.709 --> 25:44.127
- Yes.
- Paradise?

25:44.211 --> 25:45.587
Yes, paradise.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.464
- Now?
- Yes.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.425
No.

25:51.259 --> 25:52.552
No.

25:53.178 --> 25:55.847
But God is there now.

25:57.182 --> 25:58.683
And forever.

25:59.184 --> 26:02.020
He prepares a place
for us all, even now.

26:12.822 --> 26:15.158
I'm sorry, Sebastião, for my impatience.

26:17.661 --> 26:19.412
I'm ashamed of my frustration.

26:21.915 --> 26:23.959
The child is safe
in the grace of God now

26:24.042 --> 26:25.543
and that is what is important.

26:28.672 --> 26:30.173
And you're a bad Jesuit.

26:45.188 --> 26:47.232
Sick of being trapped in here all day.

26:50.568 --> 26:51.611
Eat.

26:52.404 --> 26:55.448
We don't even know
if Father FERREIRA is alive or dead.

26:56.032 --> 26:57.951
The villagers never even heard of him.

26:58.785 --> 27:01.079
These people are so frightened.

27:02.330 --> 27:04.666
There's fear over their head, and lice.

27:04.749 --> 27:07.627
They have us, we comfort them.

27:08.586 --> 27:10.297
How much longer can we do that?

27:11.172 --> 27:13.925
We asked for this mission, Francisco.

27:14.634 --> 27:17.053
We prayed for this in the exercises.

27:17.137 --> 27:19.597
God heard us then,
and He hears us now.

27:19.681 --> 27:23.143
Well, then, may He guide us to FERREIRA
so we can know the truth.

27:27.022 --> 27:29.357
You think it's possible
that his strength gave out

27:29.441 --> 27:31.526
and he groveled to this Inquisitor Inoue,

27:31.609 --> 27:33.820
went on his knees like a dog?

27:33.903 --> 27:35.613
That's still just a rumor.

27:36.323 --> 27:38.992
Even if this Inoue
is the devil everyone claims,

27:39.075 --> 27:41.119
FERREIRA would stand up to him.

27:48.501 --> 27:50.920
One of us must go to Nagasaki
and find him.

27:51.004 --> 27:52.172
It's too dangerous.

27:52.839 --> 27:54.758
For us, for the people who shelter us.

27:56.426 --> 27:59.471
We send Kichijiro,
he brings back word we can act on.

27:59.554 --> 28:00.764
Are you mad?

28:01.431 --> 28:02.891
Where is he?

28:02.974 --> 28:04.351
He's never here.

28:05.018 --> 28:07.520
He's always drunk,
you know he can't be trusted.

28:07.604 --> 28:08.605
What do we do?

28:08.688 --> 28:10.315
We must do something
to find Father FERREIRA.

28:24.579 --> 28:25.830
Let's go out.

28:25.914 --> 28:27.123
Let's risk it.

28:27.207 --> 28:28.583
Just for a moment.

28:41.888 --> 28:42.889
Look.

28:49.270 --> 28:50.605
That's God's sign.

29:07.497 --> 29:08.665
Don't move.

29:11.501 --> 29:13.336
Someone's here watching us.

29:48.121 --> 29:49.330
<i>Padre?</i>

29:54.169 --> 29:55.253
<i>Padre?</i>

30:00.550 --> 30:02.760
No, no, no. That's not the signal.

30:21.446 --> 30:22.989
<i>Padre.</i>

30:23.907 --> 30:26.868
Do not be afraid. It's all right.

30:28.036 --> 30:30.622
We won't hurt you.

30:31.456 --> 30:34.918
We Christian, <i>Padre.</i> Christian!

30:35.502 --> 30:36.961
Christian.

30:40.882 --> 30:42.842
We need you.

30:52.936 --> 30:54.103
No, no!

30:54.479 --> 30:56.940
Sebastião, hey! No! Sebastião!

31:00.443 --> 31:01.945
<i>Padre.</i>

31:04.781 --> 31:07.784
We have frightened you. We are sorry.

31:10.203 --> 31:14.832
We want to ask you to come
to our village. To Gotō.

31:15.917 --> 31:17.877
People miss our faith there.

31:18.127 --> 31:20.296
Our children need you.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.466
We have no mass, no confession.

31:26.803 --> 31:28.638
All we can do is pray.

31:32.600 --> 31:33.810
<i>How did you know we were here?</i>

31:37.146 --> 31:39.899
Who told you?
Was it one of the faithful?

31:42.944 --> 31:46.739
It was a Christian
of our village. Kichijiro.

31:48.533 --> 31:49.534
Kichijiro?

31:53.079 --> 31:54.706
Our... Our Kichijiro?

31:55.582 --> 31:57.375
He said he came here.

31:58.293 --> 31:59.294
With you.

32:00.628 --> 32:02.171
Yes, but he's not a Christian.

32:02.672 --> 32:04.007
Yes, he is.

32:05.466 --> 32:09.596
It's true.
He spoke against God to the Inquisitor,

32:09.679 --> 32:10.847
Inoue-<i>sama.</i>

32:11.347 --> 32:13.975
<i>But that was eight years ago.</i>

32:24.861 --> 32:27.238
<i>His whole family was put to death.</i>

32:28.364 --> 32:30.199
He spoke against God.

32:30.366 --> 32:32.535
But he still believes.

32:37.206 --> 32:38.416
<i>No. No.</i>

32:38.541 --> 32:40.376
They need priests on Gotō.

32:40.460 --> 32:43.129
- No, <i>Padre.</i>
- But, MOKICHI, we will return here.

32:43.212 --> 32:45.048
- No, no, <i>Padre.</i>
- We will return here.

32:45.131 --> 32:48.468
I do not know the people of Gotō.

32:48.551 --> 32:52.013
So I do not know they can be trusted.

32:52.138 --> 32:54.641
These are Christians. Like us.

32:54.766 --> 32:56.893
Kichijiro told them to come here.

32:57.393 --> 32:59.020
I'm not sure why.

32:59.103 --> 33:00.521
Why does he do anything?

33:00.855 --> 33:02.523
Kichijiro brought us here to Tomogi.

33:06.069 --> 33:08.112
It'll only be for a few days.

33:11.407 --> 33:16.371
But one will stay here? Please.

33:19.624 --> 33:20.625
Yes.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.222
We're losing them.

35:16.491 --> 35:17.575
That's right.

35:33.049 --> 35:35.593
<i>The fear I'd felt
on the journey faded away.</i>

35:36.719 --> 35:40.556
<i>Because the joy which greeted me
was almost as great as my own.</i>

35:43.351 --> 35:46.854
<i>Even the sight of Kichijiro
was somehow welcome.</i>

35:50.399 --> 35:51.526
Come.

35:51.609 --> 35:53.903
<i>I thanked God for bringing me here.</i>

36:02.620 --> 36:05.748
<i>On that day, the faithful
received fresh hope.</i>

36:07.750 --> 36:09.085
<i>And I was renewed.</i>

36:21.264 --> 36:23.015
<i>And they came to me.</i>

36:24.851 --> 36:28.354
<i>Not only from Gotō,
for the Christians made their way</i>

36:28.437 --> 36:30.606
<i>through the mountains
from other villages.</i>

36:32.108 --> 36:34.443
<i>I felt God Himself was so near.</i>

36:35.653 --> 36:37.864
<i>Their lives here are so hard.</i>

36:37.947 --> 36:40.324
<i>They live like beasts
and die like beasts.</i>

36:42.118 --> 36:45.705
<i>But Christ did not die
for the good and beautiful.</i>

36:45.788 --> 36:47.540
<i>That is easy enough.</i>

36:47.623 --> 36:51.836
<i>The hard thing is to die
for the miserable and corrupt.</i>

36:53.504 --> 36:56.132
<i>But here, I knew I was one of them</i>

36:56.632 --> 36:59.302
<i>and I shared the hunger of their spirit.</i>

37:03.514 --> 37:05.391
<i>Another prayer was answered on Gotō.</i>

37:06.976 --> 37:09.270
<i>It was there I learned the first real news</i>

37:09.353 --> 37:11.981
<i>of someone who might know
of Father FERREIRA.</i>

37:13.482 --> 37:14.942
<i>Padre</i> FERREIRA.

37:15.026 --> 37:16.402
<i>Padre</i> FERREIRA.

37:16.652 --> 37:18.112
- Yes, do you know him?
- Yes.

37:18.195 --> 37:19.280
- You know him?
- Yes.

37:19.363 --> 37:20.823
- You've seen him?
- Yes.

37:23.284 --> 37:24.785
When?

37:25.828 --> 37:28.748
He made a pray for infant and the...

37:28.831 --> 37:30.416
Infant.

37:30.499 --> 37:31.542
Infant.

37:32.209 --> 37:33.920
- Baby! Baby!
- Infant.

37:34.003 --> 37:35.254
- Yeah!
- Sorry, infant.

37:35.338 --> 37:37.340
And sick, sick.

37:38.507 --> 37:40.134
At Shimachi.

37:40.718 --> 37:42.637
- Shimachi. Shimachi.
- Shimachi.

37:43.346 --> 37:47.516
But that was before the trouble.

37:48.726 --> 37:49.769
Where is this?

37:49.852 --> 37:52.688
- Near Nagasaki. Nagasaki.
- Nagasaki.

37:53.022 --> 37:56.025
But so dangerous. Dangerous to go.

37:58.694 --> 38:00.571
- No?
- I don't know. I don't know.

38:02.698 --> 38:05.534
<i>They are desperate
for tangible signs of faith.</i>

38:06.327 --> 38:08.037
<i>So I provided what I could.</i>

38:09.747 --> 38:12.500
<i>I worry they value
these poor signs of faith</i>

38:12.583 --> 38:14.043
<i>more than faith itself.</i>

38:16.170 --> 38:18.172
<i>But how could we deny them?</i>

38:19.757 --> 38:22.760
<i>And finally, I had to part with my rosary.</i>

38:41.904 --> 38:43.280
Kichijiro!

38:43.614 --> 38:44.907
Kichijiro!

38:47.868 --> 38:50.663
<i>In Gotō, I was completely overwhelmed.</i>

38:50.746 --> 38:55.251
<i>I baptized over 100 adults and children,
heard confessions without number.</i>

38:56.043 --> 39:00.423
<i>But it was from Kichijiro
that I felt the greatest need.</i>

39:03.426 --> 39:05.094
You did not take the rosary.

39:05.886 --> 39:07.304
I did not deserve it.

39:08.222 --> 39:09.265
Why?

39:11.267 --> 39:12.685
'Cause you denied God?

39:13.394 --> 39:14.437
Yes.

39:18.149 --> 39:19.567
<i>But only to live!</i>

39:21.110 --> 39:22.695
<i>My whole family...</i>

39:22.778 --> 39:24.572
<i>The Inquisitor, Inoue,</i>

39:24.655 --> 39:27.158
wanted us to give up our faith.

39:28.534 --> 39:31.787
Stamp on Jesus with our foot.

39:33.289 --> 39:35.124
Just once, just pressed.

39:36.834 --> 39:38.461
But they would not.

39:41.297 --> 39:44.258
But I did.

39:54.185 --> 39:57.021
<i>But I could not abandon them,</i>

39:59.148 --> 40:01.609
even if I had abandoned God.

40:08.908 --> 40:11.619
<i>So I watched them die.</i>

40:17.500 --> 40:19.418
<i>Wherever I go,</i>

40:19.502 --> 40:23.130
<i>I see the fire and smell the flesh.</i>

40:24.256 --> 40:29.011
<i>When I saw you and</i> Padre <i>Garupe,
for the first time,</i>

40:29.845 --> 40:31.138
<i>I started to believe</i>

40:33.224 --> 40:35.351
that God might take me back!

40:37.812 --> 40:40.606
Because in my dreams

40:42.566 --> 40:45.569
the fire was no longer so bright!

41:03.879 --> 41:06.215
You want me to hear
your confession now?

41:15.558 --> 41:17.059
Bless me, <i>Padre,</i>

41:19.478 --> 41:20.729
for I have sinned.

41:30.656 --> 41:35.077
<i>Those six days at Gotō
and Kichijiro's renewal of faith</i>

41:35.369 --> 41:38.038
<i>made me feel that my life was of value</i>

41:38.539 --> 41:41.917
<i>and that I could really be of use
to people in this country</i>

41:42.001 --> 41:43.252
<i>at the ends of the Earth.</i>

41:48.048 --> 41:51.927
Men from the Inquisitor,
they are in the village.

41:52.052 --> 41:53.512
They took ICHIZO.

45:23.013 --> 45:26.392
No, we are not afraid to die, <i>Padres,</i>

45:26.517 --> 45:28.519
and we will never surrender you.

45:28.602 --> 45:30.020
No one should die.

45:30.104 --> 45:33.565
No. But we will be in danger
whether you go or stay.

45:33.649 --> 45:35.442
So stay. Stay.

45:36.318 --> 45:37.528
We will never surrender you.

45:37.611 --> 45:40.030
They'll keep coming back if we stay.

45:40.114 --> 45:42.825
They could destroy the entire village
and kill you all, while we hide.

45:42.908 --> 45:44.159
No.

45:44.243 --> 45:46.745
Yes, we have no choice, MOKICHI.
It is the only thing to do.

45:46.829 --> 45:48.664
This will draw the danger
away from you.

45:49.581 --> 45:51.500
We can hide on Kichijiro's island.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.088
My island?

45:57.756 --> 46:01.844
No. There is no difference
between there and here.

46:02.010 --> 46:04.179
They will come to Gotō.
They will search.

46:05.180 --> 46:07.015
Same thing will happen.

46:45.387 --> 46:47.014
You will stay.

46:54.271 --> 46:57.357
Me, MOKICHI,

46:57.441 --> 46:59.568
and two more hostages.

48:05.801 --> 48:08.011
I'm not an informer!

48:08.303 --> 48:09.805
I confessed all my sins.

48:24.236 --> 48:25.237
Hey!

48:46.300 --> 48:47.342
<i>Padre?</i>

48:54.683 --> 48:55.684
<i>Padre.</i>

48:57.185 --> 49:01.148
If we are forced to trample

49:01.565 --> 49:04.693
on the Lord, on the <i>fumie...</i>

49:08.196 --> 49:10.282
You must pray for courage, MOKICHI.

49:10.866 --> 49:12.534
But if we do not do what they want,

49:13.327 --> 49:16.038
then it can be danger
for everyone in the village.

49:16.246 --> 49:17.873
They can be put in prison!

49:18.457 --> 49:19.708
Taken away forever.

49:20.959 --> 49:22.377
What should we do?

49:23.795 --> 49:25.297
Trample.

49:25.589 --> 49:26.798
Trample.

49:28.258 --> 49:29.676
It's all right to trample.

49:31.595 --> 49:32.888
What are you saying?

49:35.265 --> 49:36.266
You can't!

49:38.560 --> 49:41.605
MOKICHI, you can't.

49:58.121 --> 49:59.122
Amen.

50:13.970 --> 50:15.847
I make this for the <i>Jiisama.</i>

50:17.099 --> 50:18.433
It was all we had.

50:20.018 --> 50:21.269
Until you came.

50:23.772 --> 50:26.608
Take this. Please.

50:29.277 --> 50:30.654
In Jesus' name.

50:35.951 --> 50:39.663
Your faith gives me strength, MOKICHI.

50:40.914 --> 50:44.126
I wish I could give as much to you.

50:45.127 --> 50:46.628
My love for God is strong.

50:49.089 --> 50:50.799
Could that be the same as faith?

50:53.093 --> 50:54.136
Yes.

50:56.430 --> 50:58.473
Yes. I think it must be.

51:14.322 --> 51:18.618
<i>These people are the most devoted
of God's creatures on Earth.</i>

51:20.620 --> 51:23.957
<i>Father VALIGNANO, I confess,
I began to wonder.</i>

51:25.167 --> 51:29.755
<i>God sends us trials to test us
and everything He does is good.</i>

51:29.838 --> 51:32.841
<i>And I prayed to undergo trials
like his son.</i>

51:33.884 --> 51:37.429
<i>But why must their trial be so terrible?</i>

51:41.057 --> 51:43.560
<i>And why, when I look in my own heart,</i>

51:44.811 --> 51:47.981
<i>do the answers I give them
seem so weak?</i>

52:44.454 --> 52:46.414
<i>All of them did
as they were commanded.</i>

52:48.166 --> 52:49.543
<i>But it was not enough.</i>

54:39.361 --> 54:41.947
<i>Old ICHIZO would not do it.</i>

54:42.072 --> 54:43.698
<i>MOKICHI could not.</i>

54:45.116 --> 54:47.535
<i>But Kichijiro succeeded
where the rest failed.</i>

54:49.371 --> 54:52.040
<i>I must believe he suffered
along with the others.</i>

55:36.668 --> 55:38.086
<i>They were given sake,</i>

55:39.087 --> 55:42.424
<i>as the Roman soldier
offered vinegar to the dying Christ.</i>

55:46.928 --> 55:49.472
<i>I prayed they remembered
our Lord's suffering</i>

55:50.306 --> 55:52.434
<i>and took courage and comfort from it.</i>

58:21.875 --> 58:24.169
<i>It took MOKICHI four days to die.</i>

58:30.508 --> 58:32.427
<i>At the end, he sang a hymn.</i>

58:33.803 --> 58:35.930
<i>His voice was the only sound.</i>

58:36.931 --> 58:38.266
<i>The people of the village</i>

58:38.349 --> 58:41.269
<i>who were gathered on the beach
were always silent.</i>

1:00:33.631 --> 1:00:35.591
<i>The people were watched closely</i>

1:00:35.717 --> 1:00:38.219
<i>so the bodies could not be
given a Christian burial.</i>

1:00:41.723 --> 1:00:44.142
<i>Mokichi's body
was so heavy with water,</i>

1:00:44.225 --> 1:00:47.770
<i>it turned the flames to smoke
before it finally caught fire.</i>

1:00:50.815 --> 1:00:53.276
<i>Any bones that remained
were scattered in the ocean</i>

1:00:53.401 --> 1:00:55.403
<i>so they could not be venerated.</i>

1:01:04.746 --> 1:01:09.000
<i>Father VALIGNANO, you will say
that their death is not meaningless.</i>

1:01:09.083 --> 1:01:11.919
<i>Surely God heard their prayers
as they died.</i>

1:01:13.087 --> 1:01:14.797
<i>But did He hear their screams?</i>

1:01:15.798 --> 1:01:18.718
<i>How can I explain His silence
to these people</i>

1:01:18.801 --> 1:01:20.845
<i>who have endured so much?</i>

1:01:21.637 --> 1:01:25.016
<i>I need all my strength
to understand it myself.</i>

1:01:27.435 --> 1:01:30.229
<i>This may be my last report
to you, Father.</i>

1:01:30.313 --> 1:01:33.649
<i>Today we hear the guards
are in the mountains looking for us.</i>

1:01:34.650 --> 1:01:37.570
<i>So we have decided
it will be safer to separate.</i>

1:01:37.653 --> 1:01:39.614
They were right.

1:01:39.697 --> 1:01:41.783
If we left, they might still be alive.

1:01:41.908 --> 1:01:43.117
Don't say that. That's not true.

1:01:43.201 --> 1:01:45.411
And we cannot doubt,
that will be our death.

1:01:45.495 --> 1:01:46.704
Are we giving up?
Is that what we are doing?

1:01:46.788 --> 1:01:48.206
- Are we running away?
- No.

1:01:48.289 --> 1:01:49.374
After people have died for us.

1:01:49.791 --> 1:01:51.125
They did not die for us.

1:01:51.209 --> 1:01:53.044
Garupe, they did not die for us.

1:01:54.504 --> 1:01:56.130
I feel like a coward.

1:02:06.808 --> 1:02:08.101
My love goes with you.

1:02:08.393 --> 1:02:09.977
I pray to be as strong as you.

1:02:17.819 --> 1:02:21.864
<i>Father Garupe will make for Hirado
to continue the mission.</i>

1:02:21.948 --> 1:02:23.032
<i>And I will return to Gotō.</i>

1:02:23.783 --> 1:02:25.952
Francisco, stay alive.

1:02:27.620 --> 1:02:28.871
Stay alive.

1:02:29.914 --> 1:02:34.043
<i>Father, I ask forgiveness
for my weakness and my doubt.</i>

1:02:35.545 --> 1:02:37.839
<i>And I ask you to remember
Father Garupe and me</i>

1:02:37.922 --> 1:02:39.924
<i>in your masses and in your prayers.</i>

1:02:42.385 --> 1:02:44.262
<i>Your obedient son.</i>

1:03:02.363 --> 1:03:04.031
<i>I imagine your Son</i>

1:03:05.533 --> 1:03:07.034
<i>nailed to the cross.</i>

1:03:08.953 --> 1:03:11.831
<i>My mouth tastes like vinegar.</i>

1:03:21.674 --> 1:03:23.301
Is that Gotō?

1:03:27.180 --> 1:03:28.639
Is that Gotō?

1:03:35.605 --> 1:03:37.899
<i>Father in heaven, praised be thy name.</i>

1:03:38.733 --> 1:03:41.444
<i>I'm just a foreigner
who brought disaster.</i>

1:03:42.403 --> 1:03:44.405
<i>And that's what they think of me now.</i>

1:04:48.761 --> 1:04:50.930
<i>I dream of our St. Francis.</i>

1:04:53.140 --> 1:04:57.228
<i>What happened to all the glorious
possibility he found here?</i>

1:05:01.524 --> 1:05:03.234
<i>What have I done for Christ?</i>

1:05:04.860 --> 1:05:06.737
<i>What am I doing for Christ?</i>

1:05:08.489 --> 1:05:10.283
<i>What will I do for Christ?</i>

1:05:23.045 --> 1:05:24.547
<i>I feel so tempted.</i>

1:05:24.630 --> 1:05:26.799
<i>I feel so tempted to despair.</i>

1:05:27.883 --> 1:05:29.260
<i>I'm afraid.</i>

1:05:30.928 --> 1:05:32.972
<i>The weight of your silence is terrible.</i>

1:05:34.682 --> 1:05:36.475
<i>I pray, but I'm lost.</i>

1:05:39.604 --> 1:05:41.897
<i>Or am I just praying to nothing?</i>

1:05:44.400 --> 1:05:45.818
<i>Nothing.</i>

1:05:46.819 --> 1:05:48.863
<i>Because you are not there.</i>

1:06:26.484 --> 1:06:28.402
<i>I pray for your forgiveness.</i>

1:06:47.046 --> 1:06:50.132
<i>If my report now comes
to an abrupt end,</i>

1:06:50.216 --> 1:06:51.967
<i>do not think that we are dead.</i>

1:06:53.469 --> 1:06:55.721
<i>Forif Garupe and I die,</i>

1:06:55.805 --> 1:06:58.140
<i>the Japanese church dies with us.</i>

1:07:22.540 --> 1:07:24.291
I thought I was being followed.

1:07:25.251 --> 1:07:26.836
Are you all right, <i>Padre?</i>

1:07:28.754 --> 1:07:29.797
Sorry.

1:07:42.268 --> 1:07:43.269
<i>Padre?</i>

1:07:48.065 --> 1:07:50.359
Why did you come back here, <i>Padre?</i>

1:07:50.443 --> 1:07:52.194
This place is dangerous.

1:07:53.571 --> 1:07:55.656
We must be careful.

1:07:55.740 --> 1:07:59.076
There is a price
of 300 pieces of silver for you.

1:07:59.160 --> 1:08:00.703
Three hundred.

1:08:01.495 --> 1:08:03.122
Judas got only 30.

1:08:03.831 --> 1:08:07.042
There are Christians near the villages.

1:08:07.126 --> 1:08:08.502
Not far.

1:08:11.964 --> 1:08:14.925
We can hide there.
I will take care of you.

1:08:24.351 --> 1:08:26.395
Take it. Please.

1:08:29.356 --> 1:08:31.192
You must be so hungry.

1:08:50.711 --> 1:08:53.005
MOKICHI and my family stayed strong.

1:08:54.256 --> 1:08:55.549
I am so weak.

1:08:56.675 --> 1:08:57.676
Are you?

1:08:58.260 --> 1:09:00.179
You can certainly look after yourself.

1:09:00.262 --> 1:09:01.597
Not to be selfish.

1:09:03.224 --> 1:09:04.350
I am like you.

1:09:05.726 --> 1:09:07.353
I have nowhere else to go.

1:09:09.688 --> 1:09:11.982
Where is the place for a weak man

1:09:14.360 --> 1:09:15.986
in a world like this?

1:09:26.163 --> 1:09:28.916
You want to confess
for MOKICHI and ICHIZO?

1:09:46.392 --> 1:09:48.853
<i>"What you will do, do quickly."</i>

1:09:49.812 --> 1:09:52.731
<i>Your Son's words to Judas
at the Last Supper.</i>

1:09:54.817 --> 1:09:56.443
<i>Was he angry when he said them?</i>

1:09:58.279 --> 1:09:59.864
<i>Or did they come from love?</i>

1:10:01.240 --> 1:10:02.867
Are you all right, <i>Padre?</i>

1:10:02.950 --> 1:10:04.994
- You seem so tired.
- I'm all right.

1:10:06.078 --> 1:10:08.372
The fish you gave me was so salty.

1:10:08.914 --> 1:10:10.583
I thirst.

1:10:11.292 --> 1:10:12.960
- What?
- I thirst.

1:10:15.296 --> 1:10:17.464
- Our Lord said that.
- Yes.

1:10:18.591 --> 1:10:20.634
I get some water.

1:10:23.012 --> 1:10:25.014
- I get water.
- Kichijiro!

1:10:28.267 --> 1:10:29.560
Kichijiro.

1:10:40.863 --> 1:10:43.073
Sorry, I dropped the water, <i>Padre.</i>

1:10:43.782 --> 1:10:45.075
I thought something was wrong.

1:10:46.035 --> 1:10:47.620
But, never mind.

1:10:47.786 --> 1:10:49.663
There is a stream just nearby.

1:10:49.955 --> 1:10:51.999
You can drink as much as you like.

1:10:55.961 --> 1:10:56.962
Here.

1:12:28.178 --> 1:12:30.431
<i>Padre,</i> forgive me.

1:12:34.476 --> 1:12:35.811
<i>Padre?</i>

1:12:43.235 --> 1:12:45.446
I pray for God's forgiveness.

1:12:47.448 --> 1:12:50.701
Will he forgive? Even me?

1:13:33.660 --> 1:13:35.204
Blessed be God.

1:13:37.956 --> 1:13:39.625
What is... What is your name?

1:13:40.084 --> 1:13:41.752
Monica.

1:13:41.835 --> 1:13:44.004
Like the mother of Augustine.

1:13:44.338 --> 1:13:46.048
My baptismal name.

1:13:46.131 --> 1:13:47.841
This man is Juan.

1:13:49.635 --> 1:13:52.888
He wanted his name
to be like our priest Juan,

1:13:52.971 --> 1:13:55.265
who died at Unzen.

1:13:57.309 --> 1:13:59.603
There will be many more joining him.

1:14:01.271 --> 1:14:02.815
You understand.

1:14:07.444 --> 1:14:10.989
Why are you...
Why are you looking at me like that?

1:14:13.033 --> 1:14:14.535
Why are you so calm?

1:14:15.828 --> 1:14:18.622
We are all about to die!

1:14:19.540 --> 1:14:20.874
Like that!

1:14:31.009 --> 1:14:32.219
I'm sorry.

1:14:33.971 --> 1:14:36.515
I'm sorry. Thank you.
Thank you for the food.

1:14:40.269 --> 1:14:41.728
<i>Padre...</i>

1:14:41.812 --> 1:14:43.689
Our father,

1:14:43.772 --> 1:14:46.525
<i>Padre</i> Juan said if we die,

1:14:46.608 --> 1:14:48.944
we will go to <i>paraíso.</i>

1:14:49.027 --> 1:14:50.028
Paradise.

1:14:50.737 --> 1:14:52.322
Yes, that's right.

1:14:52.406 --> 1:14:54.116
Isn't it good to die?

1:14:54.199 --> 1:14:56.869
<i>Paraíso</i> is so much better than here.

1:14:56.952 --> 1:14:58.370
No one hungry.

1:14:58.662 --> 1:15:01.832
Never sick. No taxes. No hard work.

1:15:03.292 --> 1:15:04.960
Yes. Of course.

1:15:05.919 --> 1:15:09.047
<i>Padre</i> Juan was right.

1:15:09.131 --> 1:15:13.552
There is no hard work in <i>paraíso.</i>

1:15:14.595 --> 1:15:16.430
There is no work at all.

1:15:16.513 --> 1:15:18.932
There is no taxes.

1:15:20.225 --> 1:15:22.060
There is no suffering.

1:15:22.436 --> 1:15:25.314
We all will be united with God.

1:15:25.397 --> 1:15:27.858
There will be no pain.

1:17:01.576 --> 1:17:03.120
No, not you.

1:17:03.203 --> 1:17:04.663
You stay.

1:17:18.260 --> 1:17:21.221
You understood
what I was saying to them?

1:17:21.972 --> 1:17:24.474
Your Japanese is good enough?

1:17:26.435 --> 1:17:28.687
I saw your eyes.

1:17:30.063 --> 1:17:32.899
And what did you think you saw there?

1:17:36.737 --> 1:17:37.988
They're fools.

1:17:38.071 --> 1:17:39.906
Those peasants.

1:17:41.575 --> 1:17:45.495
<i>Lord, spare them suffering
and keep them safe in Your hand.</i>

1:17:45.579 --> 1:17:48.832
They can talk among themselves
without end.

1:17:48.915 --> 1:17:51.335
And decide nothing.

1:17:52.294 --> 1:17:54.796
But you understand, don't you?

1:17:57.758 --> 1:17:59.092
Just say what you mean.

1:17:59.968 --> 1:18:03.805
That it all depends on you
whether they are set free,

1:18:04.765 --> 1:18:07.434
if you say just one single word.

1:18:08.101 --> 1:18:09.102
Show them.

1:18:09.436 --> 1:18:11.271
Deny your faith.

1:18:13.690 --> 1:18:15.525
So what if I refuse?

1:18:15.609 --> 1:18:16.818
You kill me?

1:18:17.652 --> 1:18:20.447
The blood of martyrs
is the seed of the church.

1:18:21.281 --> 1:18:25.035
Just like the priests you slaughtered
in Ōmura and Nagasaki.

1:18:25.118 --> 1:18:27.245
We learned from our mistake.

1:18:27.329 --> 1:18:31.958
Killing the priests
and killing the peasants makes it worse.

1:18:33.293 --> 1:18:38.715
If they can die for their God,
they think it only makes them stronger.

1:18:39.966 --> 1:18:43.720
If you feel you must punish someone,
punish me alone.

1:18:48.850 --> 1:18:52.312
You do not speak like a good priest!

1:18:53.146 --> 1:18:57.234
If you were a real man,
a truly good priest,

1:18:57.317 --> 1:19:00.320
you should feel pity for the Christian.

1:19:00.904 --> 1:19:03.824
Isn't that so, <i>Padre,</i> isn't that so?

1:19:13.166 --> 1:19:17.003
The price for your glory
is their suffering.

1:19:41.987 --> 1:19:43.697
<i>Padre,</i>

1:19:44.197 --> 1:19:46.366
praise be to God, our Father.

1:19:47.742 --> 1:19:49.703
Praise be to Him.

1:19:52.706 --> 1:19:56.376
The Portuguese language was a gift
of your Father Cabral.

1:19:57.878 --> 1:20:00.881
I have been asked to interpret
on your behalf.

1:20:03.967 --> 1:20:08.513
There was concern that we might miss
certain subtleties in your testimony

1:20:08.597 --> 1:20:11.391
if you were told to speak
only in Japanese.

1:20:12.225 --> 1:20:13.477
Testimony?

1:20:13.560 --> 1:20:14.603
We want it to be fair.

1:20:14.769 --> 1:20:16.980
And we do have
a better grasp of your language

1:20:17.063 --> 1:20:18.607
than you do of ours.

1:20:19.566 --> 1:20:23.737
Father Cabral never managed
much more than <i>arigataya.</i>

1:20:24.654 --> 1:20:28.825
All the time he lived here,
he taught, but would not learn.

1:20:28.909 --> 1:20:33.371
He despised our language,
our food, our customs.

1:20:33.455 --> 1:20:35.749
I'm not like him. I'm not like Cabral.

1:20:36.583 --> 1:20:38.293
- Really?
- Yes.

1:20:39.669 --> 1:20:42.380
We have our own religion, <i>Padre.</i>

1:20:42.464 --> 1:20:44.674
Pity you did not know this yet.

1:20:44.758 --> 1:20:47.344
No. No, no.
We just think a different way.

1:20:47.427 --> 1:20:48.595
True.

1:20:48.678 --> 1:20:51.264
You believe our Buddhists are only men.

1:20:51.598 --> 1:20:53.016
Just human beings.

1:20:53.099 --> 1:20:54.768
Even a Buddha dies.

1:20:55.685 --> 1:20:57.270
Like all men.

1:20:57.354 --> 1:20:59.439
- He is not the Creator.
- You are ignorant.

1:21:01.107 --> 1:21:05.445
<i>Padre,</i> only a Christian would see
Buddhists simply as men.

1:21:05.946 --> 1:21:09.407
Our Buddha is a being
which men can become.

1:21:09.491 --> 1:21:13.870
Something greater than himself
if he can overcome all his illusions.

1:21:13.954 --> 1:21:18.416
But you cling to your illusions
and call them faith.

1:21:18.500 --> 1:21:19.709
No, you don't understand.

1:21:19.793 --> 1:21:21.711
If any man follows
God's commandments,

1:21:21.795 --> 1:21:23.797
then he can live a peaceful
and joyous life.

1:21:23.880 --> 1:21:25.298
I do. I do understand.

1:21:26.633 --> 1:21:29.219
<i>Padre,</i> it is perfectly simple.

1:21:32.055 --> 1:21:34.140
Have you heard that word?

1:21:37.352 --> 1:21:41.231
It means fall down, surrender,

1:21:41.314 --> 1:21:43.066
give up the faith.

1:21:43.149 --> 1:21:45.318
Apostatize, as you say.

1:21:45.902 --> 1:21:46.903
Do it.

1:21:47.362 --> 1:21:51.908
If you don't apostatize,
the prisoners will be hung over the pit.

1:21:51.992 --> 1:21:57.038
Until you do, their lives bleeding away
drop by drop.

1:21:57.163 --> 1:22:00.584
Some last for days, some do not.

1:22:00.667 --> 1:22:02.627
They die.

1:22:02.711 --> 1:22:06.172
They tortured
Fathers Porro and Cassola over the pit.

1:22:06.256 --> 1:22:08.091
Have you heard of them?

1:22:08.174 --> 1:22:10.427
There was one called Pedro, too.

1:22:10.510 --> 1:22:11.678
And FERREIRA of course.

1:22:12.429 --> 1:22:13.555
FERREIRA?

1:22:13.763 --> 1:22:15.348
Did you know him?

1:22:18.018 --> 1:22:19.686
I have... I have heard of him.

1:22:19.769 --> 1:22:23.106
No doubt. He's well-known
all over Japan now.

1:22:23.189 --> 1:22:26.860
The priest with the Japanese name
and the Japanese wife.

1:22:29.696 --> 1:22:31.698
- I don't believe you.
- You can ask anyone.

1:22:32.741 --> 1:22:35.952
People in Nagasaki
point him out and marvel.

1:22:38.955 --> 1:22:41.458
He's held in great esteem now,

1:22:41.541 --> 1:22:44.878
which, I believe, is why
he came here in the first place.

1:23:08.151 --> 1:23:10.737
<i>I thought that martyrdom
would be my salvation.</i>

1:23:11.321 --> 1:23:14.783
<i>Please, please, God,
do not let it be my shame.</i>

1:23:18.995 --> 1:23:21.081
<i>The Lord is my refuge,
and my deliverer.</i>

1:23:21.164 --> 1:23:23.667
<i>My God is my helper,
and in Him will I put my trust.</i>

1:23:23.750 --> 1:23:26.836
<i>Of the Blood, all price exceeding,
shed by our immortal King,</i>

1:23:26.920 --> 1:23:29.422
<i>destined for the world's redemption.</i>

1:23:41.267 --> 1:23:43.436
Why are you following me?

1:23:46.773 --> 1:23:48.525
Stop following me!

1:24:20.390 --> 1:24:23.518
<i>Thank you, Lord,
for the gentle days here.</i>

1:24:25.854 --> 1:24:28.565
Jesus taught me to love everyone.

1:24:28.648 --> 1:24:33.153
But I cannot feel love to those
who torture our friends to death.

1:24:34.070 --> 1:24:36.489
I am angry. I cannot love them.

1:24:36.573 --> 1:24:40.577
<i>Even the guards have been touched
by your hand, Lord.</i>

1:24:40.660 --> 1:24:42.287
I feel guilty.

1:24:42.370 --> 1:24:44.748
<i>I wonder if this unbroken peace...</i>

1:24:44.831 --> 1:24:46.916
From Him comes my salvation.

1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:50.003
<i>...is proof that my death is not far away.</i>

1:24:50.086 --> 1:24:51.921
I shall never be shaken.

1:24:52.005 --> 1:24:53.590
I shall never be shaken.

1:24:53.673 --> 1:24:55.341
I shall never be shaken.

1:24:55.425 --> 1:25:00.221
<i>I see the life of your son so clearly,
almost like my own.</i>

1:25:01.431 --> 1:25:05.393
<i>And his face, it takes all fear from me.</i>

1:25:06.519 --> 1:25:09.439
<i>It is the face I remember
from childhood.</i>

1:25:10.690 --> 1:25:12.150
<i>Speaking to me.</i>

1:25:12.692 --> 1:25:14.402
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

1:25:15.361 --> 1:25:17.739
<i>Promising "I will not abandon you."</i>

1:25:19.365 --> 1:25:21.451
<i>"I will not abandon you."</i>

1:25:22.452 --> 1:25:24.287
<i>"I will not abandon you."</i>

1:25:26.539 --> 1:25:29.375
Put them on.

1:25:29.459 --> 1:25:33.379
You should be honored.
It's what our priests wear.

1:25:53.566 --> 1:25:57.904
Father RODRIGUES from Portugal, yes?

1:25:58.446 --> 1:26:01.574
I am sorry, <i>Padre,</i> for my speaking.

1:26:01.991 --> 1:26:04.494
My language is not so good.

1:26:04.577 --> 1:26:08.081
But his Lordship,
the Governor of Chikugo,

1:26:08.164 --> 1:26:11.751
is anxious about your comfort.

1:26:13.586 --> 1:26:14.838
Comfort?

1:26:15.922 --> 1:26:17.674
Perhaps discomfort.

1:26:17.757 --> 1:26:20.009
Discomfort. Yes.

1:26:20.426 --> 1:26:24.848
About why you are here,
and if you are not at ease,

1:26:24.931 --> 1:26:26.432
please say so.

1:26:30.812 --> 1:26:32.772
Your trip was long.

1:26:32.856 --> 1:26:34.732
There were many dangers.

1:26:35.275 --> 1:26:38.611
The power of your determination
touches us greatly.

1:26:41.114 --> 1:26:43.366
We know you have also suffered greatly.

1:26:43.700 --> 1:26:46.286
We do not wish to add to your suffering.

1:26:46.953 --> 1:26:51.249
And the thought that
we might do so is painful for us, too.

1:26:53.334 --> 1:26:54.752
Thank you.

1:26:55.086 --> 1:26:56.212
<i>Padre.</i>

1:26:57.672 --> 1:27:02.510
The doctrine you bring with you
may be true in Spain and Portugal,

1:27:02.594 --> 1:27:04.596
but we have studied it carefully.

1:27:04.679 --> 1:27:06.723
Thought about it over much time.

1:27:09.893 --> 1:27:14.397
And find it is of no use
and of no value in Japan.

1:27:19.068 --> 1:27:21.821
We have concluded that it is a danger.

1:27:28.661 --> 1:27:30.997
But we believe
we have brought you the truth.

1:27:33.166 --> 1:27:35.460
The truth is universal.

1:27:35.543 --> 1:27:37.837
It's common to all countries at all times.

1:27:37.921 --> 1:27:40.048
That's why we call it the truth.

1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:47.055
If a doctrine weren't as true
here in Japan as it is in Portugal,

1:27:47.138 --> 1:27:50.016
then we couldn't call it the truth.

1:27:57.357 --> 1:28:00.360
I see you do not
work with your hands, Father.

1:28:02.445 --> 1:28:06.366
But everyone knows a tree
which flourishes in one kind of earth

1:28:06.449 --> 1:28:09.118
may decay and die in another.

1:28:12.246 --> 1:28:14.958
It is the same
with the tree of Christianity.

1:28:15.041 --> 1:28:17.210
The leaves decay here.

1:28:18.127 --> 1:28:20.505
The buds die.

1:28:20.588 --> 1:28:22.465
It is not the soil that has killed the buds.

1:28:22.548 --> 1:28:27.220
There were 300,000 Christians
here in Japan before the soil was...

1:28:32.433 --> 1:28:33.893
Yes?

1:28:35.395 --> 1:28:37.230
Was poisoned.

1:28:46.948 --> 1:28:48.741
You have no reply?

1:28:50.660 --> 1:28:52.662
And why should you? You're...

1:28:52.745 --> 1:28:55.164
You're never going to change my heart.

1:28:56.749 --> 1:28:59.752
And it seems like
I'm not going to change yours.

1:29:00.253 --> 1:29:03.548
You want to test my faith?
Give me a real challenge.

1:29:04.424 --> 1:29:06.426
Bring me to the Inquisitor.

1:29:06.509 --> 1:29:09.262
Bring me to Inoue-<i>sama.</i>

1:29:19.939 --> 1:29:21.649
Why are they laughing?

1:29:22.275 --> 1:29:24.277
I didn't say anything funny.
Why are they laughing?

1:29:24.610 --> 1:29:25.653
Because, <i>Padre...</i>

1:29:28.948 --> 1:29:30.283
Because...

1:29:32.452 --> 1:29:35.455
I am the Governor of Chikugo.

1:29:36.456 --> 1:29:39.459
I am the Inquisitor.

1:29:42.128 --> 1:29:44.047
I am Inoue.

1:30:30.259 --> 1:30:33.805
How long... How long will they
have to work like this in the rain?

1:30:33.888 --> 1:30:35.515
Until finished.

1:30:53.324 --> 1:30:57.120
<i>Padre. Padre! Padre!</i>

1:30:57.995 --> 1:30:59.247
Please listen to me.

1:31:01.165 --> 1:31:03.501
Please listen to me!

1:31:03.584 --> 1:31:05.920
I never took their money!

1:31:06.045 --> 1:31:08.673
I did not betray you for money!

1:31:53.009 --> 1:31:54.760
Be careful of him, <i>Padre.</i>

1:31:54.844 --> 1:31:58.723
Maybe Inoue-<i>sama</i> pays him
to make us trample.

1:31:58.806 --> 1:32:00.391
No, he did not!

1:32:02.602 --> 1:32:05.646
Please, <i>Padre.</i> Let me confess.

1:32:06.564 --> 1:32:08.065
<i>Padre...</i>

1:32:23.831 --> 1:32:25.833
I know I smell.

1:32:25.917 --> 1:32:27.376
I smell of sin.

1:32:28.586 --> 1:32:32.757
I want to confess again
so the Lord can wash me clean.

1:32:38.596 --> 1:32:40.598
Why did you come here?

1:32:44.101 --> 1:32:45.978
Is it for absolution?

1:32:48.564 --> 1:32:51.150
Do you have any understanding
what absolution is?

1:32:51.234 --> 1:32:53.778
Do you understand
what I've been saying?

1:32:54.904 --> 1:32:56.530
Years ago,

1:32:57.198 --> 1:32:59.700
I could have died a good Christian.

1:33:00.243 --> 1:33:02.662
There was no persecution!

1:33:03.663 --> 1:33:05.665
Why was I born now?

1:33:06.499 --> 1:33:08.376
This is so unfair!

1:33:10.169 --> 1:33:11.545
I am sorry.

1:33:16.842 --> 1:33:18.844
But do you still believe?

1:33:42.243 --> 1:33:46.038
Bless me, <i>Padre,</i> for I have sinned.

1:33:47.373 --> 1:33:51.585
I am sorry for being so weak.

1:33:53.713 --> 1:33:57.466
I am sorry this has happened.

1:34:00.094 --> 1:34:04.307
I am sorry for what I did to you.

1:34:06.600 --> 1:34:10.396
Help me, <i>Padre.</i> Take away the sin.

1:34:13.232 --> 1:34:15.735
I will try again to be strong!

1:34:20.239 --> 1:34:23.909
<i>Father, how could
Jesus love a wretch like this?</i>

1:34:25.911 --> 1:34:27.747
<i>There is evil all around in this place.</i>

1:34:27.830 --> 1:34:30.458
<i>I sense its strength, even its beauty.</i>

1:34:31.917 --> 1:34:34.587
<i>But there is none of that in this man.</i>

1:34:35.629 --> 1:34:38.257
<i>He is not worthy to be called evil.</i>

1:34:47.266 --> 1:34:48.517
Go in peace.

1:34:52.605 --> 1:34:54.106
<i>I feel...</i>

1:34:54.607 --> 1:34:57.860
<i>I... I fear. Jesus, forgive me.</i>

1:34:57.943 --> 1:35:00.571
<i>I may not be worthy of you.</i>

1:36:00.714 --> 1:36:03.300
<i>Ikitsuki-jima, Kuboura, Chokichi.</i>

1:36:32.246 --> 1:36:33.581
<i>Onajiku, Haru.</i>

1:36:54.935 --> 1:36:56.562
<i>Onajiku, Tobe.</i>

1:37:25.090 --> 1:37:26.342
<i>Onajiku, Wataichi.</i>

1:38:51.594 --> 1:38:54.305
<i>Thank you, Lord, for hearing my prayer.</i>

1:42:26.141 --> 1:42:31.688
I'm sorry I've neglected you
for some days now, <i>Padre.</i>

1:42:32.272 --> 1:42:35.484
But I had business in Hirado.

1:42:36.068 --> 1:42:39.947
I hope you get to go there
yourself sometime.

1:42:41.323 --> 1:42:42.950
I'm sure it's very beautiful.

1:42:43.033 --> 1:42:48.455
There is an interesting story
about the <i>daimyo</i> who ruled there.

1:42:48.539 --> 1:42:52.417
He had four concubines. Four!

1:42:53.544 --> 1:42:57.548
They were all beautiful, but they...

1:43:00.092 --> 1:43:01.802
I'm sorry.

1:43:01.885 --> 1:43:05.722
Maybe this is not a story
for a celibate priest.

1:43:06.223 --> 1:43:08.767
It's all right. Please go on.

1:43:08.851 --> 1:43:13.105
In that case, the <i>daimyo's</i>
concubines were all jealous

1:43:13.188 --> 1:43:16.024
and they fought and fought without end.

1:43:16.108 --> 1:43:21.196
So the <i>daimyo</i> of Hirado
drove them away from his castle,

1:43:21.280 --> 1:43:24.700
and peace came into his life again.

1:43:25.826 --> 1:43:28.620
Do you think this story has a lesson?

1:43:31.290 --> 1:43:32.291
Yes.

1:43:34.084 --> 1:43:36.670
That this was a very wise man.

1:43:37.045 --> 1:43:38.338
I'm glad.

1:43:38.422 --> 1:43:42.384
That means you understand
the <i>daimyo</i> is like Japan,

1:43:42.759 --> 1:43:46.597
and these concubines are Spain,

1:43:47.264 --> 1:43:51.351
Portugal, Holland, England.

1:43:51.560 --> 1:43:55.272
Each trying to gain the advantage
against the other

1:43:55.355 --> 1:43:57.941
and destroy the house in the process!

1:43:59.610 --> 1:44:02.362
Since you say this man is wise,

1:44:02.446 --> 1:44:06.783
you will understand why
we must outlaw the Christian.

1:44:08.702 --> 1:44:09.995
Well,

1:44:10.537 --> 1:44:13.457
our church teaches monogamy.

1:44:20.130 --> 1:44:21.423
One wife.

1:44:22.215 --> 1:44:26.678
What if Japan were to choose
one lawful wife from the four?

1:44:29.056 --> 1:44:31.099
You mean Portugal.

1:44:31.183 --> 1:44:32.309
No.

1:44:33.727 --> 1:44:35.687
I mean, the Holy Church.

1:44:41.360 --> 1:44:45.030
Don't you think
it would be better for the man

1:44:45.113 --> 1:44:49.368
to forget about foreign women
and choose one of his own?

1:44:49.451 --> 1:44:53.080
Nationality is not so important
when it comes to a marriage.

1:44:53.163 --> 1:44:55.207
What matters is love.

1:44:55.749 --> 1:44:58.794
Love and fidelity.

1:44:59.586 --> 1:45:00.837
Love.

1:45:02.297 --> 1:45:03.966
<i>Padre,</i>

1:45:04.049 --> 1:45:09.596
there are men who are plagued
by the persistent love of an ugly woman.

1:45:11.890 --> 1:45:14.726
Is that what missionary work is to you?

1:45:15.686 --> 1:45:17.229
An ugly woman?

1:45:17.312 --> 1:45:18.689
Well...

1:45:20.565 --> 1:45:22.109
Yes.

1:45:28.865 --> 1:45:30.659
- Barren.
- A barren woman

1:45:30.742 --> 1:45:32.744
cannot be a true wife.

1:45:34.913 --> 1:45:38.875
If the gospel has lost its way here,
it's not the fault of the church.

1:45:39.835 --> 1:45:41.795
It is the fault of those

1:45:42.254 --> 1:45:44.631
who tear away the faithful
from their faith

1:45:44.715 --> 1:45:46.800
like a husband from a wife.

1:45:49.511 --> 1:45:52.264
You mean me?

1:45:54.808 --> 1:45:55.976
<i>Padre,</i>

1:45:56.935 --> 1:46:00.772
you missionaries
do not seem to know Japan.

1:46:01.189 --> 1:46:03.900
And you, Honorable Inquisitor,

1:46:04.359 --> 1:46:06.903
do not seem to know Christianity.

1:46:20.917 --> 1:46:26.423
There are those who think
of your religion as a curse.

1:46:27.132 --> 1:46:28.717
I do not.

1:46:29.009 --> 1:46:31.970
I see it in another way.

1:46:32.262 --> 1:46:35.348
But still dangerous.

1:46:51.823 --> 1:46:57.579
I'd like you to think about
the persistent love of an ugly woman

1:46:57.662 --> 1:47:01.583
and how a barren woman
should never be a wife.

1:47:11.093 --> 1:47:12.260
Padre!

1:47:12.636 --> 1:47:15.347
<i>Padre!</i> Help me, <i>Padre!</i>

1:47:17.849 --> 1:47:19.518
Help me, please!

1:47:19.935 --> 1:47:21.853
<i>Padre! Padre!</i>

1:47:23.021 --> 1:47:24.064
<i>Padre!</i>

1:47:24.147 --> 1:47:26.441
Where are you taking them?

1:47:27.317 --> 1:47:29.528
Where are you taking them?

1:47:30.070 --> 1:47:32.697
<i>Padre! Padre!</i>

1:47:33.031 --> 1:47:35.075
<i>Padre!</i>

1:47:39.830 --> 1:47:41.456
You are traveling today.

1:48:26.751 --> 1:48:30.338
Sit down. It's better for you, I think.

1:48:31.089 --> 1:48:32.382
Please.

1:48:45.812 --> 1:48:46.897
<i>Padre.</i>

1:48:47.939 --> 1:48:49.774
How are you feeling today?

1:48:51.776 --> 1:48:54.112
I'm sure the air must feel good

1:48:55.030 --> 1:48:57.532
even though you were
in our newest prison.

1:48:57.616 --> 1:49:00.535
The old prison was very tough
on the <i>padres.</i>

1:49:00.619 --> 1:49:03.705
- Rain, wind...
- Sorry. Excuse me.

1:49:04.789 --> 1:49:06.958
When will Inoue-<i>sama</i> be here?

1:49:08.585 --> 1:49:10.503
He's not coming today.

1:49:11.504 --> 1:49:12.964
Do you miss him?

1:49:13.882 --> 1:49:15.508
He treats me kindly.

1:49:15.592 --> 1:49:19.137
Three meals a day so that
my body will betray my heart.

1:49:19.888 --> 1:49:21.556
That's your plan, isn't it?

1:49:21.640 --> 1:49:23.099
That's what you're waiting for.

1:49:23.183 --> 1:49:24.643
- Not at all.
- No?

1:49:26.311 --> 1:49:29.022
But we are waiting for someone today.

1:49:29.105 --> 1:49:31.483
Inoue-<i>sama</i> wants you to meet him.

1:49:33.151 --> 1:49:35.153
He will be here any moment.

1:49:36.071 --> 1:49:38.240
He's Portuguese like yourself.

1:49:38.323 --> 1:49:41.243
You should have a lot to talk about?

1:49:42.869 --> 1:49:44.496
FERREIRA.

1:49:59.719 --> 1:50:01.513
Is it who you expected?

1:50:05.684 --> 1:50:08.395
Is it who you expected?

1:50:14.567 --> 1:50:17.821
- I want to talk to him.
- There's no hurry.

1:50:18.738 --> 1:50:21.199
It is early. Plenty of time.

1:50:23.660 --> 1:50:26.454
Tell me. Does he know I'm here?

1:50:26.997 --> 1:50:28.373
I cannot tell you.

1:50:28.456 --> 1:50:32.377
I must not speak about the business
of the Inquisitor's office.

1:50:32.752 --> 1:50:34.879
But I can tell you

1:50:35.463 --> 1:50:40.093
he knows you are alive
because we told him you apostatized.

1:50:47.058 --> 1:50:50.312
Now, do you know what
they use those mats for?

1:50:51.438 --> 1:50:52.480
No.

1:50:59.362 --> 1:51:01.114
Look. The guard.

1:51:01.781 --> 1:51:04.868
What could he be saying
to Father Garupe?

1:51:06.494 --> 1:51:07.787
Maybe this.

1:51:07.996 --> 1:51:11.750
If you are truly a Christian,
you will apostatize

1:51:12.375 --> 1:51:14.294
and not let them die.

1:51:27.390 --> 1:51:32.270
You know, the Inquisitor promises
that if Father Garupe apostatizes,

1:51:32.354 --> 1:51:34.272
the four will be free.

1:51:34.481 --> 1:51:36.733
I hope Father Garupe agrees.

1:51:40.236 --> 1:51:44.074
I should tell you,
these Christians already trampled

1:51:44.157 --> 1:51:47.243
and denied their faith
at the Inquisitor's office.

1:51:47.452 --> 1:51:49.621
If they did what you wanted,
then let them go.

1:51:49.704 --> 1:51:52.082
Let them go. They did what you wanted.

1:51:52.165 --> 1:51:53.666
So let them go. Please.

1:51:53.750 --> 1:51:56.044
Please! Please! Please! Let them go!

1:51:56.127 --> 1:51:57.420
We don't want them.

1:51:57.504 --> 1:51:58.922
Four farmers?

1:51:59.005 --> 1:52:01.007
There are still hundreds
of Christian peasants

1:52:01.091 --> 1:52:02.759
on the islands off the coast.

1:52:02.842 --> 1:52:05.720
- No!
- We want the <i>Padre</i> to deny,

1:52:05.804 --> 1:52:07.806
and be an example to them.

1:52:12.352 --> 1:52:14.813
No, please!

1:52:15.188 --> 1:52:17.857
<i>Apostatize! Apostatize!</i>

1:52:17.941 --> 1:52:21.194
<i>For their sake, Lord,
do not leave this to us!</i>

1:52:21.277 --> 1:52:23.279
Take me instead!

1:52:28.284 --> 1:52:29.661
No!

1:52:30.787 --> 1:52:32.080
No!

1:52:33.623 --> 1:52:36.584
No, no, no! Garupe, no!

1:52:39.045 --> 1:52:41.506
No, no, no! No!

1:52:44.676 --> 1:52:46.344
No!

1:53:08.074 --> 1:53:09.075
No!

1:53:10.243 --> 1:53:11.327
No!

1:53:15.665 --> 1:53:16.708
No!

1:53:19.711 --> 1:53:22.130
Please! Please, please!

1:53:59.667 --> 1:54:02.837
Terrible business! Terrible!

1:54:04.339 --> 1:54:07.050
No matter how many times you see it.

1:54:08.635 --> 1:54:12.514
Think about the suffering
you have inflicted on these people

1:54:12.805 --> 1:54:16.476
just because of your selfish dream
of a Christian Japan.

1:54:16.726 --> 1:54:20.355
Your <i>Deus</i> punishes Japan through you!

1:54:21.773 --> 1:54:24.234
At least Garupe was clean.

1:54:24.734 --> 1:54:27.695
But you, you have no will!

1:54:28.363 --> 1:54:31.741
You do not deserve to be called a priest.

1:55:08.611 --> 1:55:10.572
My God. My God.
Why have you forsaken me?

1:55:10.655 --> 1:55:11.864
Why have you forsaken me?

1:55:14.200 --> 1:55:15.827
I was your son.

1:55:18.871 --> 1:55:21.291
Your son was going to the cross.

1:55:24.794 --> 1:55:26.671
You were silent, even to him.

1:55:27.797 --> 1:55:31.134
<i>Your silent, cold son.</i>

1:55:33.428 --> 1:55:34.804
No, no.

1:55:37.807 --> 1:55:39.809
<i>Ludicrous. Ludicrous.</i>

1:55:42.103 --> 1:55:43.479
Stupid.

1:55:44.314 --> 1:55:45.690
Stupid.

1:55:50.570 --> 1:55:52.572
He's not going to answer.

1:55:58.077 --> 1:56:00.079
He's not going to answer.

1:56:33.571 --> 1:56:35.114
<i>Padre.</i>

1:56:36.032 --> 1:56:37.367
<i>Padre.</i>

1:57:13.319 --> 1:57:15.029
Come along, <i>Padre.</i>

1:57:26.749 --> 1:57:29.335
Our priests do not like your priests,

1:57:29.419 --> 1:57:32.380
but you will still find much of value here.

1:57:56.988 --> 1:57:58.656
What is it, <i>Padre?</i>

1:58:01.242 --> 1:58:02.869
The incense?

1:58:04.954 --> 1:58:06.622
The smell of meat?

1:58:09.667 --> 1:58:12.128
Have you had any meat
since you came to Japan?

1:58:12.211 --> 1:58:14.630
I don't much like the smell, myself.

1:58:21.971 --> 1:58:23.306
Have you guessed yet?

1:58:25.183 --> 1:58:27.435
Have you guessed who's coming?

1:58:30.688 --> 1:58:32.940
This is Inoue-<i>sama's</i> command

1:58:33.483 --> 1:58:36.527
and the other's wish.

1:58:41.491 --> 1:58:42.867
The other?

1:58:51.334 --> 1:58:54.045
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name,

1:58:54.170 --> 1:58:55.797
thy kingdom come, thy will be done...

1:58:55.880 --> 1:59:00.718
<i>Padre,</i> think of the souls you can save,

1:59:00.802 --> 1:59:02.386
<i>Padre</i> FERREIRA.

2:00:14.625 --> 2:00:16.252
Father...

2:00:23.759 --> 2:00:25.678
Father FERREIRA.

2:00:28.764 --> 2:00:30.474
I'd given up.

2:00:34.770 --> 2:00:36.647
So long since we have met.

2:00:40.318 --> 2:00:42.153
Please say something.

2:00:44.530 --> 2:00:45.907
What

2:00:47.074 --> 2:00:50.161
can I say to you on such an occasion?

2:00:55.041 --> 2:00:58.169
If you have any pity for me,
say something.

2:01:08.429 --> 2:01:10.097
Have you... Have you...

2:01:10.181 --> 2:01:12.683
Have you been living here for long?

2:01:14.268 --> 2:01:16.729
About a year, I suppose.

2:01:24.195 --> 2:01:26.113
Why? What is this place?

2:01:26.197 --> 2:01:29.492
A temple where I study.

2:01:33.204 --> 2:01:35.623
I'm in... I'm in a sort of prison

2:01:35.706 --> 2:01:39.877
somewhere in Nagasaki.
I don't know precisely where.

2:01:39.961 --> 2:01:41.379
I know it.

2:01:45.883 --> 2:01:47.218
You were my teacher.

2:01:50.513 --> 2:01:52.556
You were my confessor.

2:01:52.848 --> 2:01:55.393
- My teacher.
- I'm much the same.

2:02:05.820 --> 2:02:08.698
Do a single simple thing.

2:02:08.948 --> 2:02:10.866
Tell me then, <i>Padre.</i>

2:02:11.534 --> 2:02:14.495
Tell me you agree.

2:02:27.383 --> 2:02:28.759
Do I...

2:02:30.511 --> 2:02:33.097
Do I really seem so different?

2:02:38.686 --> 2:02:42.481
The Honorable Sawano
spends his day writing

2:02:42.565 --> 2:02:44.275
about astronomy.

2:02:45.609 --> 2:02:47.528
At Inoue-<i>sama's</i> order.

2:02:47.611 --> 2:02:51.115
There is great knowledge here.

2:02:51.866 --> 2:02:55.036
But in medicine and astronomy,
much remains to be taught.

2:02:56.078 --> 2:02:57.913
I'm happy to help.

2:02:58.789 --> 2:03:04.003
It is fulfilling to finally
be of use in this country.

2:03:07.882 --> 2:03:09.592
Then you're happy, Father?

2:03:13.971 --> 2:03:15.473
I said so.

2:03:21.812 --> 2:03:23.773
Mention the other book you are writing.

2:03:27.443 --> 2:03:29.403
It is called <i>Kengiroku.</i>

2:03:29.487 --> 2:03:31.822
It shows the errors of Christianity

2:03:32.364 --> 2:03:35.117
and refutes the teachings of <i>Deus.</i>

2:03:35.576 --> 2:03:37.703
Do you understand the title?

2:03:38.829 --> 2:03:40.081
Tell him.

2:03:43.626 --> 2:03:45.961
It means

2:03:46.087 --> 2:03:51.175
deceit disclosed, or unmasked,
if you prefer a more florid reading.

2:03:53.761 --> 2:03:57.807
His Lordship, the Inquisitor,
he praises it.

2:03:57.890 --> 2:04:00.101
He says it is well done.

2:04:02.937 --> 2:04:03.938
It's the truth.

2:04:04.021 --> 2:04:06.357
You use the truth like poison!

2:04:06.440 --> 2:04:08.275
What a funny thing for a priest to say.

2:04:08.359 --> 2:04:11.028
This is cruel. Cruel.

2:04:11.862 --> 2:04:15.699
Worse than any torture
to twist a man's soul in this way.

2:04:16.367 --> 2:04:18.786
I think you must be speaking of yourself.

2:04:18.869 --> 2:04:20.621
Not of Sawano Chūan.

2:04:20.704 --> 2:04:22.373
- Who?
- Him!

2:04:23.040 --> 2:04:25.709
He is FERREIRA only to you.

2:04:26.210 --> 2:04:28.838
He is Sawano Chūan now.

2:04:29.547 --> 2:04:31.841
A man who has found peace.

2:04:32.133 --> 2:04:34.468
Let him guide you along his path.

2:04:34.552 --> 2:04:36.303
The path of mercy.

2:04:36.387 --> 2:04:38.764
That means only that you abandon self.

2:04:38.848 --> 2:04:42.101
No one should interfere
with another man's spirit.

2:04:42.184 --> 2:04:46.939
To help others is the way of the Buddha
and your way, too.

2:04:47.022 --> 2:04:49.608
The two religions are the same in this.

2:04:49.692 --> 2:04:51.944
It is not necessary to win anyone over

2:04:52.027 --> 2:04:55.531
to one side or another
when there is so much to share.

2:04:56.574 --> 2:04:57.950
Go on.

2:05:01.453 --> 2:05:05.082
I've been told to get you
to abandon the faith.

2:05:08.294 --> 2:05:09.587
This...

2:05:12.047 --> 2:05:13.757
This is from the pit.

2:05:16.802 --> 2:05:21.765
You're tied so you can't move
and hung upside down.

2:05:24.602 --> 2:05:26.395
<i>An incision is made.</i>

2:05:31.358 --> 2:05:35.404
<i>You feel the blood
dripping down, drop by drop,</i>

2:05:36.614 --> 2:05:40.618
so it doesn't run to your head
and you won't die too soon.

2:05:53.297 --> 2:05:55.299
Step on your Jesus.

2:06:40.427 --> 2:06:43.264
You are the last priest
left here now, <i>Padre.</i>

2:06:43.347 --> 2:06:47.768
I'm sure Inoue-<i>sama</i> will be pleased
to put an end to the pain.

2:06:48.352 --> 2:06:50.354
He's a practical man, <i>Padre.</i>

2:06:50.729 --> 2:06:52.398
Not a cruel one.

2:06:53.107 --> 2:06:56.318
I have labored in this country
for 15 years.

2:06:56.402 --> 2:06:58.445
I know it better than you.

2:06:59.029 --> 2:07:02.700
Our religion does not
take root in this country.

2:07:03.033 --> 2:07:05.786
Because the roots have been torn up.

2:07:05.869 --> 2:07:08.747
No! Because this country is a swamp.

2:07:08.831 --> 2:07:10.291
Nothing grows here.

2:07:10.374 --> 2:07:12.501
Plant a sapling here and the roots rot.

2:07:12.584 --> 2:07:15.462
There was a time when Christianity
grew and flourished here.

2:07:15.546 --> 2:07:16.588
- When?
- When?

2:07:17.047 --> 2:07:19.758
In your time, Father.

2:07:21.218 --> 2:07:23.887
In your time, before you became like...

2:07:23.971 --> 2:07:25.806
Like who? Like them?

2:07:25.889 --> 2:07:27.308
RODRIGUES, please listen.

2:07:27.725 --> 2:07:31.478
The Japanese only believe
in their distortion of our gospel.

2:07:31.562 --> 2:07:33.147
So they did not believe at all.

2:07:33.230 --> 2:07:34.732
They never believed.

2:07:34.815 --> 2:07:35.899
How can you say that?

2:07:35.983 --> 2:07:38.694
From the time of St. Francis Xavier
through your own time.

2:07:38.777 --> 2:07:40.821
There were hundreds
of thousands of converts here.

2:07:40.904 --> 2:07:42.906
- Converts?
- Converts, yes!

2:07:43.657 --> 2:07:45.034
Francis Xavier came here

2:07:45.117 --> 2:07:46.994
to teach the Japanese
about the Son of God.

2:07:47.077 --> 2:07:50.748
But first he had to ask
how to refer to God.

2:07:50.831 --> 2:07:53.375
<i>"Dainichi,"</i> he was told.

2:07:54.001 --> 2:07:56.670
And shall I show you their <i>Dainichi?</i>

2:07:57.171 --> 2:08:01.967
Behold. There is the Son of God.

2:08:02.468 --> 2:08:04.762
God's only begotten Son.

2:08:06.180 --> 2:08:08.974
In the scriptures,
Jesus rose on the third day.

2:08:09.058 --> 2:08:10.309
In Japan,

2:08:11.060 --> 2:08:13.896
the Son of God rises daily.

2:08:14.396 --> 2:08:16.690
The Japanese cannot think
of an existence

2:08:16.774 --> 2:08:18.233
beyond the realm of nature.

2:08:18.317 --> 2:08:20.861
For them, nothing transcends a human.

2:08:20.944 --> 2:08:22.946
- No.
- They can't conceive

2:08:23.030 --> 2:08:24.656
of our idea of the Christian God.

2:08:24.740 --> 2:08:26.533
No, you're wrong. You're wrong.

2:08:26.617 --> 2:08:29.787
They worship God. God! Our Lord.

2:08:30.454 --> 2:08:32.373
They praise the name of <i>Deus.</i>

2:08:32.456 --> 2:08:35.584
That's just another word
for a god they never knew.

2:08:36.210 --> 2:08:37.711
I saw men die!

2:08:37.795 --> 2:08:39.046
I did, too.

2:08:39.129 --> 2:08:42.383
For <i>Deus!</i> On fire with their faith!

2:08:42.716 --> 2:08:44.885
Your martyrs may have been
on fire, Father,

2:08:44.968 --> 2:08:46.970
but it was not for the Christian faith.

2:08:48.722 --> 2:08:50.349
I saw them die. I saw them die.

2:08:50.432 --> 2:08:52.393
They did not die for nothing.

2:08:52.893 --> 2:08:54.103
They did not.

2:08:55.813 --> 2:08:58.315
They're dying for you, RODRIGUES.

2:09:02.945 --> 2:09:04.696
How many did you save

2:09:04.780 --> 2:09:07.241
when you trampled
on the face of our Lord?

2:09:07.324 --> 2:09:08.742
How many beside yourself?

2:09:08.826 --> 2:09:10.327
I don't know.

2:09:11.161 --> 2:09:14.081
Certainly not as many as you may help.

2:09:14.164 --> 2:09:17.042
You're trying to justify
your own weakness.

2:09:18.127 --> 2:09:19.920
God have mercy on you.

2:09:20.003 --> 2:09:22.214
Which god? Which one?

2:09:22.297 --> 2:09:24.466
We say...

2:09:26.343 --> 2:09:29.847
I'm sorry. You haven't learned
the language thoroughly, have you?

2:09:29.930 --> 2:09:31.807
There's a saying here.

2:09:32.182 --> 2:09:36.854
Mountains and rivers can be moved,
but man's nature cannot be moved.

2:09:37.646 --> 2:09:40.357
It's very wise, like so much here.

2:09:41.442 --> 2:09:46.196
We find our original nature
in Japan, RODRIGUES.

2:09:47.197 --> 2:09:50.159
Perhaps it's what's meant
by finding God.

2:09:52.202 --> 2:09:53.871
You're a disgrace.

2:09:58.876 --> 2:10:00.919
You're a disgrace, Father.

2:10:01.503 --> 2:10:03.005
I can't...

2:10:04.131 --> 2:10:06.884
I can't even call you that anymore.

2:10:09.178 --> 2:10:12.681
Good. I have a Japanese name now,

2:10:13.348 --> 2:10:16.059
and a wife, and children.

2:10:19.229 --> 2:10:22.065
I inherited them all
from an executed man.

2:10:37.915 --> 2:10:39.500
How do you feel?

2:10:39.583 --> 2:10:42.294
He has shown you the path of mercy.

2:10:42.377 --> 2:10:44.087
I hope you take it.

2:10:46.340 --> 2:10:48.926
Why don't you just hang me in the pit?

2:11:21.250 --> 2:11:25.337
<i>Padre,</i> you came here for them
and they all hate you.

2:11:25.921 --> 2:11:29.049
Insult me all you like.
You just give me more courage.

2:11:29.675 --> 2:11:31.677
You will need it tonight.

2:11:32.678 --> 2:11:34.638
You are a good man, <i>Padre.</i>

2:11:34.721 --> 2:11:36.348
You cannot stand suffering.

2:11:36.431 --> 2:11:38.433
Your own or others'.

2:11:42.980 --> 2:11:46.149
Inoue-<i>sama</i> says
you will apostatize tonight.

2:11:47.818 --> 2:11:49.945
He was right about FERREIRA.

2:11:51.113 --> 2:11:52.990
And he's right about you.

2:11:57.327 --> 2:12:00.330
God help me. Jesus help me.

2:12:07.296 --> 2:12:09.256
In the garden, You said,

2:12:09.339 --> 2:12:13.552
"Thy soul is sorrowful even unto death."

2:12:14.094 --> 2:12:16.138
I would bleed for you.

2:12:16.221 --> 2:12:17.598
I would.

2:12:18.473 --> 2:12:21.226
I would die for you if I knew you...

2:12:23.312 --> 2:12:25.105
Are you here with me?

2:12:42.914 --> 2:12:45.792
<i>Padre.</i> Forgive me.

2:12:47.961 --> 2:12:51.423
<i>Padre!</i> I came here to make confession.

2:12:52.549 --> 2:12:53.925
<i>Padre!</i>

2:12:55.385 --> 2:12:57.095
Forgive me, <i>Padre!</i>

2:12:57.679 --> 2:12:59.181
Forgive me!

2:13:07.856 --> 2:13:11.360
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop the noise!

2:13:11.943 --> 2:13:13.987
Stop it! Someone help him!

2:13:15.489 --> 2:13:18.283
- What do you need?
- Not me. Down there.

2:13:18.575 --> 2:13:20.327
There is a man in agony

2:13:20.410 --> 2:13:23.705
and the guard is sound asleep
and snoring like a wild dog!

2:13:24.915 --> 2:13:27.334
You think that noise is the guard?

2:13:28.001 --> 2:13:29.127
Incredible.

2:13:29.211 --> 2:13:31.755
Sawano, tell him. Say what it is.

2:13:32.756 --> 2:13:36.051
It is not the guard and it's not snoring.

2:13:38.178 --> 2:13:40.722
It's Christians. Five of them, in fact.

2:13:40.931 --> 2:13:42.849
All hanging in the pit.

2:13:48.397 --> 2:13:50.982
Have you found the words on the wall?

2:13:51.775 --> 2:13:53.527
<i>"Laudate eum."</i>

2:13:54.736 --> 2:13:56.780
"Praise Him."

2:13:58.156 --> 2:14:01.284
I cut them there with a stone
when I was in this cell.

2:14:01.368 --> 2:14:02.786
Like you.

2:14:07.249 --> 2:14:08.375
Be quiet.

2:14:08.458 --> 2:14:10.210
Don't... Don't speak to me.

2:14:10.293 --> 2:14:11.670
You have no right to speak to me.

2:14:11.753 --> 2:14:14.506
I do. Because you are just like me.

2:14:14.923 --> 2:14:16.508
You see Jesus in Gethsemane

2:14:16.591 --> 2:14:19.302
and believe your trial
is the same as His.

2:14:19.386 --> 2:14:22.055
Those five in the pit are suffering, too,
just like Jesus,

2:14:22.139 --> 2:14:23.557
but they don't have your pride.

2:14:23.640 --> 2:14:26.476
They would never
compare themselves to Jesus.

2:14:26.727 --> 2:14:29.688
Do you have the right
to make them suffer?

2:14:30.897 --> 2:14:33.567
I heard the cries of suffering
in this same cell.

2:14:33.650 --> 2:14:34.860
And I acted.

2:14:34.943 --> 2:14:36.361
You excuse yourself!
You excuse yourself!

2:14:36.445 --> 2:14:38.029
That is the spirit of darkness.

2:14:39.322 --> 2:14:42.242
And what would you do for them? Pray?

2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:46.371
And get what in return?
Only more suffering.

2:14:47.330 --> 2:14:49.916
A suffering only you can end. Not God!

2:14:50.000 --> 2:14:52.377
Go away from me.

2:14:53.086 --> 2:14:55.172
I prayed, too, RODRIGUES.

2:14:56.506 --> 2:14:58.175
It doesn't help.

2:14:59.468 --> 2:15:01.845
Go on. Pray.

2:15:08.477 --> 2:15:10.437
But pray with your eyes open.

2:15:12.189 --> 2:15:13.815
No!

2:15:28.330 --> 2:15:30.123
You can spare them.

2:15:31.082 --> 2:15:33.794
They call out for help
just as you call to God.

2:15:33.877 --> 2:15:36.171
He is silent, but you do not have to be.

2:15:36.254 --> 2:15:39.007
They should apostatize. Apostatize!

2:15:39.466 --> 2:15:42.302
God help me. Apostatize!
Korobu! Korobu!

2:15:43.220 --> 2:15:45.305
But they have apostatized.

2:15:45.388 --> 2:15:46.556
Many times over.

2:15:47.432 --> 2:15:49.476
They're here for you, RODRIGUES.

2:15:49.559 --> 2:15:52.312
As long as you don't apostatize,
they cannot be saved.

2:15:52.771 --> 2:15:55.398
A priest should act in imitation of Christ.

2:15:56.066 --> 2:15:57.943
If Christ were here...

2:15:59.820 --> 2:16:02.322
If Christ were here, He would've acted.

2:16:02.405 --> 2:16:04.616
Apostatized for their sake.

2:16:05.116 --> 2:16:07.410
No. No, He's here.

2:16:07.494 --> 2:16:09.830
Christ is here. I just can't hear Him.

2:16:10.163 --> 2:16:11.665
Show God you love Him!

2:16:11.748 --> 2:16:13.708
Save the lives of the people He loves.

2:16:16.419 --> 2:16:19.172
There is something more important

2:16:19.256 --> 2:16:21.299
than the judgment of the Church.

2:16:23.969 --> 2:16:27.180
You are now going to fulfill
the most painful act of love

2:16:27.264 --> 2:16:29.432
that has ever been performed.

2:16:49.160 --> 2:16:51.037
It's only a formality.

2:16:52.205 --> 2:16:54.124
Just a formality.

2:17:26.823 --> 2:17:28.575
<i>Come ahead, now.</i>

2:17:30.243 --> 2:17:31.912
<i>It's all right.</i>

2:17:33.496 --> 2:17:34.915
<i>Step on Me.</i>

2:17:39.044 --> 2:17:41.171
<i>I understand your pain.</i>

2:17:44.799 --> 2:17:48.511
<i>I was born into this world
to share men's pain.</i>

2:17:50.513 --> 2:17:53.391
<i>I carried this cross for your pain.</i>

2:17:58.772 --> 2:18:00.774
<i>Your life is with Me now.</i>

2:18:04.653 --> 2:18:06.029
<i>Step.</i>

2:19:38.204 --> 2:19:41.791
<i>It was in the year 1641,</i>

2:19:42.083 --> 2:19:44.961
<i>during the first of my voyages to Japan,</i>

2:19:45.336 --> 2:19:47.881
<i>that I, Dieter Albrecht,</i>

2:19:47.964 --> 2:19:50.175
<i>came upon the most extraordinary story</i>

2:19:50.800 --> 2:19:52.469
<i>in these pages.</i>

2:19:54.054 --> 2:19:55.138
Christian.

2:19:55.889 --> 2:19:57.057
Non-Christian.

2:19:57.307 --> 2:20:00.977
<i>As a physician
in a great Dutch trading company,</i>

2:20:01.352 --> 2:20:03.188
<i>I traveled widely.</i>

2:20:03.772 --> 2:20:04.939
Christian.

2:20:05.398 --> 2:20:08.485
<i>But none of the wonders
I have recounted in this journal</i>

2:20:08.818 --> 2:20:10.904
<i>has been so commented on</i>

2:20:11.905 --> 2:20:13.406
<i>as the curious matter...</i>

2:20:13.490 --> 2:20:14.741
Non-Christian.

2:20:14.949 --> 2:20:16.910
<i>...of the apostate priests.</i>

2:20:17.786 --> 2:20:19.037
Christian.

2:20:20.246 --> 2:20:24.209
<i>I came closer than any
European chronicler</i>

2:20:24.292 --> 2:20:26.211
<i>to the enigma of this country.</i>

2:20:26.294 --> 2:20:27.295
Non-Christian.

2:20:28.421 --> 2:20:32.258
<i>And to learning of the lives
of the lost priests.</i>

2:20:34.803 --> 2:20:38.098
<i>Inoue, the Inquisitor, would raid homes</i>

2:20:38.181 --> 2:20:42.352
<i>and search for any objects
with hidden Christian images.</i>

2:20:43.520 --> 2:20:44.854
Christian.

2:20:47.232 --> 2:20:48.983
<i>The two priests were required</i>

2:20:49.067 --> 2:20:52.695
<i>to examine these things
and verify their use.</i>

2:20:54.614 --> 2:20:58.243
<i>I even, on occasion,
observed them myself.</i>

2:21:01.663 --> 2:21:05.625
<i>The Dutch were the only Europeans
allowed to trade in Japan.</i>

2:21:06.376 --> 2:21:07.752
<i>All ships were searched</i>

2:21:07.836 --> 2:21:11.422
<i>to warrant they were not
smuggling religious objects.</i>

2:21:12.215 --> 2:21:15.760
<i>Nothing bearing the images
of the cross, a saint,</i>

2:21:16.136 --> 2:21:17.971
<i>or rosary could pass.</i>

2:21:33.236 --> 2:21:35.113
<i>Despite every attempt,</i>

2:21:35.196 --> 2:21:37.907
<i>a few things
inevitably were smuggled in.</i>

2:21:38.741 --> 2:21:39.784
Christian.

2:21:44.956 --> 2:21:48.042
<i>And then it was
as distressing to the Japanese</i>

2:21:48.126 --> 2:21:50.461
<i>as if blood had been spilled.</i>

2:22:01.764 --> 2:22:05.560
We were taught to love
those who scorned us.

2:22:06.853 --> 2:22:08.396
I feel nothing for them.

2:22:09.439 --> 2:22:12.275
Only our Lord can judge your heart.

2:22:15.612 --> 2:22:17.280
You said, "Our Lord."

2:22:24.662 --> 2:22:25.914
I doubt it.

2:22:32.587 --> 2:22:35.173
<i>When Sawano Chūan died,</i>

2:22:35.256 --> 2:22:40.678
<i>the other priest assumed his duties
and performed them with distinction.</i>

2:22:44.224 --> 2:22:49.103
<i>By this time, I observed he had acquired
considerable skill with the language.</i>

2:22:50.730 --> 2:22:54.400
<i>And seemed to be at peace
with his situation.</i>

2:22:56.361 --> 2:22:58.154
I have good news.

2:22:58.655 --> 2:23:00.865
A man has died in Edo.

2:23:01.991 --> 2:23:03.618
Okada San'emon.

2:23:04.494 --> 2:23:07.872
You will take his name just as it is.

2:23:08.998 --> 2:23:13.378
He had a household,
and a wife and son.

2:23:14.170 --> 2:23:16.422
You can take her as your wife.

2:23:17.924 --> 2:23:21.094
A man works best when he's not alone.

2:23:23.471 --> 2:23:26.099
You should know that on the islands of

2:23:26.182 --> 2:23:30.228
Ikitsuki and Gotō... No.

2:23:32.063 --> 2:23:36.234
There are still many farmers
who think themselves Christian.

2:23:36.776 --> 2:23:40.154
Do you like that?
They can continue to be Christian.

2:23:41.239 --> 2:23:43.950
You may take some satisfaction in that,

2:23:44.492 --> 2:23:47.161
because the roots are cut.

2:23:50.206 --> 2:23:52.208
Nothing grows in a swamp.

2:23:54.794 --> 2:23:58.006
Yes, Japan is that kind of country.

2:23:58.548 --> 2:24:01.259
The religion of the Christian
you brought us

2:24:01.342 --> 2:24:03.636
has become a strange thing.

2:24:03.720 --> 2:24:05.221
It's changed.

2:24:21.446 --> 2:24:23.865
You were not defeated by me.

2:24:24.449 --> 2:24:28.077
You were defeated
by this swamp of Japan.

2:24:32.165 --> 2:24:33.458
Welcome.

2:24:36.502 --> 2:24:42.091
<i>Okada San'emon lived in Edo
for the remaining years of his life.</i>

2:24:42.842 --> 2:24:45.762
<i>Some 10 years later,
I was allowed to visit Edo.</i>

2:24:47.263 --> 2:24:50.683
<i>The Japanese gossiped freely
about Okada San'emon.</i>

2:24:51.893 --> 2:24:53.311
<i>The Inquisitor Inoue,</i>

2:24:53.394 --> 2:24:56.272
<i>demanded repeated vows
of apostasy from him.</i>

2:24:57.023 --> 2:24:58.566
<i>And they say,</i>

2:24:58.649 --> 2:25:01.694
<i>"The fallen priest
supplied them all quickly</i>

2:25:01.778 --> 2:25:03.404
<i>"and vigorously."</i>

2:25:19.295 --> 2:25:22.340
I heard the Inquisitor
sent his men for you.

2:25:23.466 --> 2:25:25.426
- Was there trouble?
- No.

2:25:26.719 --> 2:25:28.262
No, no. Just...

2:25:28.346 --> 2:25:31.057
He only wanted to make sure
I wrote the "korobi-shoumon."

2:25:32.475 --> 2:25:35.853
My latest oath of renunciation.

2:25:45.321 --> 2:25:46.656
Thank you.

2:25:57.500 --> 2:25:59.502
For being here with me.

2:26:11.472 --> 2:26:12.598
<i>Padre...</i>

2:26:14.225 --> 2:26:15.560
No. No.

2:26:16.727 --> 2:26:20.189
I'm not... I'm not anymore.

2:26:22.358 --> 2:26:23.776
I'm a fallen priest.

2:26:23.860 --> 2:26:26.279
But you are the last priest left.

2:26:28.322 --> 2:26:30.533
You could still hear my confession.

2:26:30.825 --> 2:26:32.285
No, I can't.

2:26:33.035 --> 2:26:34.454
No! I can't!

2:26:36.372 --> 2:26:38.374
I still suffer for what I did, <i>Padre.</i>

2:26:40.543 --> 2:26:44.255
I betrayed you. I betrayed my family.

2:26:45.214 --> 2:26:47.008
I betrayed our Lord.

2:26:48.843 --> 2:26:50.261
Please...

2:26:51.387 --> 2:26:52.889
Hear my confession.

2:26:57.059 --> 2:26:58.227
<i>Padre.</i>

2:27:17.079 --> 2:27:21.083
<i>Lord, I fought against your silence.</i>

2:27:26.797 --> 2:27:28.883
<i>I suffered beside you.</i>

2:27:29.467 --> 2:27:31.219
<i>I was never silent.</i>

2:27:36.933 --> 2:27:38.392
I know.

2:27:45.107 --> 2:27:50.196
But even if God had been
silent my whole life,

2:27:53.616 --> 2:27:55.201
to this very day,

2:27:57.954 --> 2:28:00.498
everything I do, everything I've done...

2:28:06.796 --> 2:28:08.339
Speaks of Him.

2:28:11.634 --> 2:28:14.679
It was in the silence
that I heard Your voice.

2:28:33.489 --> 2:28:36.242
<i>The Inquisitor continued to insist</i>

2:28:36.325 --> 2:28:40.871
<i>on periodic examinations
of all suspected Christians.</i>

2:28:42.665 --> 2:28:45.751
<i>Okada San'emon
was not exempt from this.</i>

2:28:46.544 --> 2:28:51.173
<i>Inoue was determined
to never let his example be forgotten.</i>

2:28:51.674 --> 2:28:55.678
<i>Perhaps most particularly
by the priest himself.</i>

2:29:03.853 --> 2:29:05.354
Okada San'emon.

2:29:32.965 --> 2:29:36.302
<i>In the year 1667,</i>

2:29:36.802 --> 2:29:40.389
<i>a religious image was
discovered inside an amulet</i>

2:29:40.473 --> 2:29:43.726
<i>belonging to a servant called Kichijiro.</i>

2:29:49.982 --> 2:29:53.027
<i>The servant said
he had won it gambling,</i>

2:29:53.152 --> 2:29:54.820
<i>had never looked inside,</i>

2:29:55.029 --> 2:29:58.699
<i>and could never have gotten
the amulet from Okada San'emon</i>

2:29:58.783 --> 2:30:01.118
<i>since he was always underguard.</i>

2:30:07.416 --> 2:30:11.128
<i>The servant Kichijiro was taken away.</i>

2:30:13.214 --> 2:30:17.927
<i>After that, Okada San'emon
himself was carefully watched.</i>

2:30:18.803 --> 2:30:23.307
<i>During my last voyage in 1682,
I asked about him.</i>

2:30:23.808 --> 2:30:26.435
<i>And the Japanese were eager to reply.</i>

2:30:27.770 --> 2:30:29.480
<i>The last priest</i>

2:30:29.563 --> 2:30:32.149
<i>never acknowledged the Christian God.</i>

2:30:32.650 --> 2:30:34.860
<i>Not by word or symbol.</i>

2:30:36.112 --> 2:30:39.448
<i>He never spoke of Him
and never prayed.</i>

2:30:40.032 --> 2:30:41.951
<i>Not even when he died.</i>

2:30:43.536 --> 2:30:47.206
<i>The business of his faith
was long ended.</i>

2:30:53.796 --> 2:30:56.507
<i>Three guards
stood watch over the coffin</i>

2:30:57.508 --> 2:31:00.845
<i>until it could be taken away,
just to be certain.</i>

2:31:03.055 --> 2:31:06.308
<i>Only his wife was briefly
allowed to view the body,</i>

2:31:06.684 --> 2:31:09.520
<i>and place there,
a humble</i> mamorigatana

2:31:11.564 --> 2:31:13.607
<i>to ward off evil spirits.</i>

2:31:52.980 --> 2:31:55.775
<i>There was no indication that she wept.</i>

2:32:49.703 --> 2:32:52.998
<i>The body was treated
in the Buddhist manner.</i>

2:32:53.958 --> 2:32:57.086
<i>And he was given a posthumous
Buddhist name.</i>

2:33:08.013 --> 2:33:10.516
<i>The man who was once RODRIGUES</i>

2:33:11.934 --> 2:33:13.727
<i>ended as they wanted.</i>

2:33:15.604 --> 2:33:17.565
<i>And as I first saw him,</i>

2:33:19.483 --> 2:33:21.026
<i>lost to God.</i>

2:33:27.449 --> 2:33:30.244
<i>But as to that, indeed,</i>

2:33:31.954 --> 2:33:33.789
<i>only God can answer.</i>
