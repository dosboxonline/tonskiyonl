00:36.458 --> 00:38.458
[wind howling]

00:49.958 --> 00:52.666
[fire crackles]

01:15.416 --> 01:17.541
[electricity crackles]

01:29.041 --> 01:31.875
-[grunts, groans]
-[coughs]

01:32.875 --> 01:34.458
-[groans]
-Rex?

01:34.541 --> 01:35.916
[groans] Thanks.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.041
We need to get moving
before their reinforcements get here.

01:39.125 --> 01:41.083
[Hunter] Is there another way
off this spire?

01:41.166 --> 01:43.333
[chuckles] There's always another way.

01:46.416 --> 01:48.166
[coos, sniffs]

02:00.791 --> 02:03.083
[strains, grunts]

02:05.583 --> 02:06.583
[sighs]

02:20.583 --> 02:23.125
Our leech vessel is docked
about ten levels down.

02:23.625 --> 02:26.541
[Howzer] Doesn't have a hyperdrive though.
We won't get far.

02:26.625 --> 02:28.625
[Rex] No,
but we can use it to contact Echo.

02:33.125 --> 02:35.916
[strains, grunts]

02:38.958 --> 02:40.958
[ships approaching]

03:16.000 --> 03:19.291
[commander] These are clones.
They're not insurgents.

03:19.791 --> 03:21.333
[clone commando] They are both.

03:24.708 --> 03:27.083
I neutralized most of their rogue cell,

03:27.833 --> 03:31.958
but the rest are trapped inside
with the target.

03:32.041 --> 03:34.208
What squadron are you with?

03:34.291 --> 03:36.166
That's classified.

03:36.250 --> 03:39.041
Want to tell me why this spire is burning

03:39.125 --> 03:42.500
when our primary objective
is to retrieve the target unharmed?

03:42.583 --> 03:45.291
The girl is alive.

03:45.375 --> 03:50.500
I'm now in charge of this operation.
You answer to me. Is that clear?

03:52.125 --> 03:53.208
[sighs]

03:53.750 --> 03:56.583
Hilo, set blasters to stun and move in.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.333
[Hilo] We're moving in.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.291
[device beeping]

04:28.583 --> 04:29.458
[comm beeps]

04:29.541 --> 04:31.500
[stormtrooper]
Commander, you need to see this.

04:35.833 --> 04:37.833
They're escaping
through the middle of the spire.

04:38.625 --> 04:41.958
We'll take team one and infiltrate
this rock from the platform below.

04:42.666 --> 04:45.791
Set charges and seal this passage.
We'll pin them inside.

04:46.541 --> 04:48.625
Team two,
hold your position and stay alert.

04:55.041 --> 04:58.500
Sir, the operative has gone
after the target. Should I pursue?

04:58.583 --> 05:02.500
Negative. Proceed with the plan.
Seal off that access point.

05:02.583 --> 05:04.125
[stormtrooper on comm] Yes, sir.

05:25.416 --> 05:26.833
Head inside and box them in.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.333
[device beeps]

06:03.083 --> 06:05.291
[Rex] The ship's docked
just down this corridor.

06:06.916 --> 06:07.916
[Crosshair] Stop.

06:08.791 --> 06:09.791
[Nemec] What is it?

06:18.583 --> 06:19.750
They're coming.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.333
I'll handle it.

06:30.708 --> 06:31.833
[sighs]

06:39.375 --> 06:40.375
[explosive beeps]

06:43.416 --> 06:44.583
[grunts]

06:47.333 --> 06:48.583
[sighs]

07:06.458 --> 07:07.458
[ship powering up]

07:10.041 --> 07:11.625
We need to go.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.208
[Wrecker] We're waitin' on you.

07:13.791 --> 07:15.083
[button clicks]

07:16.291 --> 07:18.083
[engines powering up]

07:22.375 --> 07:25.000
-[barks, pants]
-Get down. [grunts] Off!

07:25.083 --> 07:27.250
Don't worry.
She only bites half of the time.

07:27.333 --> 07:28.791
Great.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.708
Prepare to launch.

07:30.791 --> 07:32.541
[engines roaring]

07:50.000 --> 07:52.375
[alarm blaring]

07:53.666 --> 07:57.875
Remora-one, we've been compromised.
Heading to marker 025 for an extraction.

07:57.958 --> 07:59.875
Repeat. Marker 025.

08:09.416 --> 08:11.041
We're going down. Strap in!

08:18.208 --> 08:19.708
Pinpoint the crash site.

08:19.791 --> 08:21.083
-Yes, sir.
-[comm beeps]

08:29.791 --> 08:32.916
[commander]
I said to use stun blasts only.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.791
You've jeopardized this mission.

08:34.875 --> 08:37.875
I prevented the target's escape.

08:37.958 --> 08:40.000
By shooting down her ship?

08:40.750 --> 08:44.583
Our orders are to retrieve the girl
alive and unharmed.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.375
Their vessel crashed
in the upper jungle region.

08:47.458 --> 08:48.958
Get the shuttles in the air.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.875
This isn't over.

09:12.208 --> 09:15.208
-[insects chirping]
-[fire crackling]

09:20.166 --> 09:21.708
[clattering]

09:22.416 --> 09:23.625
[Wrecker grunts]

09:24.208 --> 09:26.500
-[barks, pants]
-Whoa!

09:34.000 --> 09:36.208
You good?

09:36.291 --> 09:37.500
Uh-huh.

09:37.583 --> 09:39.291
Got your crossbow?

09:39.375 --> 09:40.375
Yep.

09:40.458 --> 09:43.125
Sure you can carry those supplies?

09:43.208 --> 09:44.208
Yes.

09:44.708 --> 09:48.416
Stay close.
It's easy to get lost in this terrain.

09:48.500 --> 09:49.833
You're as bad as Hunter.

09:49.916 --> 09:52.208
Oh, I'm much worse.

09:53.916 --> 09:55.833
[Rex] Echo should meet us
at the extraction point.

09:55.916 --> 09:57.500
We'll have to continue on foot.

09:57.583 --> 09:58.666
[Hunter] How far?

09:58.750 --> 10:00.083
[Nemec] Five klicks north.

10:01.291 --> 10:03.416
[ships approaching]

10:04.041 --> 10:05.458
We've got attack shuttles inbound.

10:05.541 --> 10:06.958
[engines roaring in distance]

10:07.041 --> 10:08.291
[Rex] This way.

10:36.583 --> 10:38.375
[creatures warbling, chittering]

10:43.375 --> 10:45.041
[Crosshair sighs] What?

10:46.083 --> 10:48.375
[Howzer]
I've seen how you are with the kid.

10:48.958 --> 10:51.375
Hmm? Your point?

10:52.125 --> 10:56.833
Well… [sighs] …you're different
than you were on Ryloth.

10:57.666 --> 11:00.250
So what changed?

11:02.416 --> 11:06.291
Loyalty meant something to me.

11:07.416 --> 11:09.916
But with the Empire,
it didn't go both ways.

11:11.291 --> 11:14.208
I realized how disposable I was.

11:15.083 --> 11:16.541
You're not the only one.

11:27.666 --> 11:29.458
There's no sign of the insurgents.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.750
Get back to the shuttle
and monitor comm channels.

11:32.833 --> 11:34.250
They couldn't have gotten far.

11:34.791 --> 11:37.250
[Hilo] We have a problem.
The operative's gone rogue.

11:38.500 --> 11:40.083
I'll deal with him later.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.500
[sniffing]

12:10.333 --> 12:12.166
[sniffing continues]

12:12.958 --> 12:14.958
[barks]

12:15.041 --> 12:16.166
[Hunter] I hear it too.

12:17.708 --> 12:18.833
[yaps]

12:27.458 --> 12:30.708
[Rex] We have to knock through their line
to reach the extraction point.

12:30.791 --> 12:31.791
We've got these.

12:34.208 --> 12:35.458
[grenades beep, hum]

12:40.500 --> 12:42.166
[yapping]

12:49.000 --> 12:51.166
[Crosshair] Stick by my side,
and stay down.

13:04.875 --> 13:06.041
-[grunting]
-[snarls]

13:08.750 --> 13:11.000
[blasters firing]

13:16.083 --> 13:17.291
[ship flying over]

13:23.625 --> 13:24.458
[both scream]

13:36.416 --> 13:38.583
[Hunter] How much further
to the landing zone?

13:38.666 --> 13:41.166
-[Rex] Just ahead. Almost there.
-[Batcher snarls]

13:48.458 --> 13:49.708
[Howzer] What is it?

13:52.500 --> 13:54.083
-Nemec!
-[Crosshair] Get down.

13:57.791 --> 13:58.791
[Batcher snarls]

14:02.750 --> 14:03.875
Omega, smoke grenade.

14:03.958 --> 14:04.916
We're out.

14:10.625 --> 14:13.000
I'll draw his fire. Get to the rendezvous.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.666
[Omega on comm] I don't like that idea.

14:14.750 --> 14:15.750
Too bad.

14:19.458 --> 14:20.625
Go now!

14:21.375 --> 14:22.833
-[pants]
-[grunts]

14:40.333 --> 14:41.958
[water crashing]

15:01.500 --> 15:03.500
[both grunt]

15:05.083 --> 15:06.083
[Crosshair grunts]

15:06.875 --> 15:07.958
[shouts]

15:29.833 --> 15:31.458
[sniffs, barks]

15:43.125 --> 15:46.333
You had your chance to be one of us.

15:53.125 --> 15:56.250
-[grunts, strains]
-You chose the wrong side.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.458
[Crosshair grunts]

16:04.666 --> 16:05.666
[grunts]

16:09.000 --> 16:11.083
[gurgling]

16:20.708 --> 16:22.541
[gasps, coughs]

16:28.083 --> 16:29.375
[strains]

16:36.833 --> 16:39.416
[coughing]

16:40.125 --> 16:41.833
[sighs] Thanks. [huffs]

16:51.916 --> 16:54.291
-[datapad beeps]
-This is the extraction marker.

16:57.875 --> 17:00.458
-[ship approaching]
-[barks]

17:03.041 --> 17:05.583
-[Wrecker] That's not Echo.
-[barks]

17:16.958 --> 17:19.083
[commander] Drop your blasters. Now!

17:20.958 --> 17:21.958
Wolffe?

17:23.458 --> 17:24.666
Rex?

17:34.458 --> 17:37.750
I-- [exhales sharply]
I thought you were dead.

17:40.375 --> 17:42.625
Reports said you were killed in action.

17:43.625 --> 17:46.041
That you went down
aboard an attack cruiser.

17:46.125 --> 17:47.125
Oh, I did.

17:48.041 --> 17:50.041
I lost a lot of good men that day.

17:50.833 --> 17:51.916
And today.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.750
What are you doing here, Rex?

17:54.750 --> 17:56.625
Don't tell me you're fighting against us.

17:56.708 --> 17:59.083
No. Not against you.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.500
Against the Empire.

18:02.750 --> 18:07.791
They're imprisoning and experimenting on
our brothers, killed others.

18:08.875 --> 18:11.125
The Empire wouldn't do that to us.

18:11.208 --> 18:13.166
She has seen it.

18:13.875 --> 18:17.041
It's true.
That's what's happening on Tantiss.

18:20.041 --> 18:21.291
We have to stop them.

18:22.125 --> 18:23.291
You can help us.

18:24.208 --> 18:26.416
You can stand with us.

18:27.458 --> 18:30.833
I am a soldier of the Empire.

18:31.875 --> 18:32.875
I have my orders.

18:33.458 --> 18:36.666
Hand the girl over, and I'll make sure
you're given a fair trial.

18:36.750 --> 18:38.125
[snarls]

18:38.208 --> 18:40.291
Think about what you're doing, Wolffe.

18:40.875 --> 18:43.500
I know you've been trained
not to question orders,

18:44.416 --> 18:45.791
but open your eyes.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.666
You're hunting a child.

18:49.958 --> 18:52.750
I know that's not who you are.

18:54.958 --> 19:00.458
As your brother,
I'm asking you to do the right thing.

19:02.541 --> 19:03.833
[sighs]

19:03.916 --> 19:06.333
[datapad beeping]

19:08.166 --> 19:10.041
[ship approaching]

19:10.791 --> 19:12.833
Sir, there's an unmarked vessel inbound.

19:12.916 --> 19:14.583
[engines roaring]

19:38.625 --> 19:39.625
Commander?

19:40.208 --> 19:41.458
Stand down.

20:01.791 --> 20:04.125
[engines powering up]

20:13.583 --> 20:16.250
Recover their fallen, then we move out.

20:16.958 --> 20:19.875
But, sir, they're traitors.

20:21.250 --> 20:22.250
Perhaps.

20:23.000 --> 20:24.208
But they're clones.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.500
We owe them that.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.875
[strains]

20:58.583 --> 21:00.083
[coughs]

21:01.458 --> 21:03.833
[pants]

21:14.541 --> 21:17.291
I'm sorry about your men.

21:18.041 --> 21:19.041
Thanks.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.750
You know,
I thought that the end of the war

21:22.833 --> 21:25.500
would mean an end
to losing more of our brothers.

21:26.666 --> 21:29.291
But I was wrong.

21:29.958 --> 21:32.583
Rex, you can't win this fight.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.041
The Empire is too strong.

21:36.041 --> 21:39.041
I can't just walk away. Not now.

21:40.916 --> 21:45.541
And neither can you.
Not with the Empire being after the kid.

21:47.875 --> 21:49.541
We'll protect her.

21:50.291 --> 21:52.708
I heard what Omega said about her escape.

21:53.708 --> 21:58.750
I think she's vital to whatever
they're doing on Tantiss.

22:00.416 --> 22:02.416
And if you want to keep her safe,

22:03.541 --> 22:07.958
you need to find out
why she's so important to them.
