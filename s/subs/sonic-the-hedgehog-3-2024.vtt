No.

- What?

Wait a second.

I thought
we were going tubing.

Hold on, hold on.
Is this a race?

04:29.878 --> 04:31.358
You're going down!

04:31.532 --> 04:33.534
It is my destiny
to claim the throne

04:35.797 --> 04:37.015
[laughs] Cute.

Are you sure
you want to challenge

04:38.626 --> 04:40.192

in the universe?

04:40.367 --> 04:42.282
I mean, that's kind of
my whole brand.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.414
Okay, Tom and Maddie,

04:44.588 --> 04:46.242
- count us down.
- Right!

04:46.416 --> 04:48.549
Don't worry,
a little sibling rivalry
is healthy.

04:48.723 --> 04:50.725
Me and my brothers used to
do this kind of thing
all the time.

04:50.899 --> 04:53.336
Tom, your brothers are lunatics
and neither of them
were born with the power

04:53.510 --> 04:55.817
to trigger a global
cataclysmic event.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.514
That's a fair point.
Did you hear that, boys?

04:57.688 --> 04:58.994
No cataclysmic events, okay?

04:59.168 --> 05:00.561
Let's keep this

I am also defeating you,

How is that even possible?
I do not lose.

05:54.179 --> 05:56.138
I am also defeating you, hedgehog.

Okay, okay, I get it, man.
No need to rub it in.

05:59.054 --> 06:02.971
Come on, Sonic!
Catch up! Yeah!

06:03.145 --> 06:05.495
Wait, what's going on?

06:05.669 --> 06:07.976
[yelps]
Why are you guys acting like...

06:09.760 --> 06:10.848

06:11.022 --> 06:12.459
Which means...

06:12.633 --> 06:15.679
I remain the undefeated

06:15.853 --> 06:17.768
Yes!

06:26.777 --> 06:29.214

the day you came to Earth, bud.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.137
It's your "Earth Day Birthday."

06:39.311 --> 06:41.009
So the race
was just a distraction,

06:41.183 --> 06:42.663
which I totally didn't fall for,
by the way--

06:42.837 --> 06:43.881
Good try, though--

06:44.055 --> 06:46.014
so you could throw a party
for me?

06:46.188 --> 06:48.364
Today, we honor you, hedgehog.

06:48.538 --> 06:51.541
If it wasn't for you, none of us
would be here right now.

06:51.715 --> 06:53.238
The boys are right, bud.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.718
You know, the day you came
to this planet

06:54.892 --> 06:56.459
is the day all our lives
changed forever.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.765
And we became a family.

07:15.086 --> 07:17.872
Thanks for the surprise party.
It really means a lot to me.

07:18.046 --> 07:19.830
Ah, you deserve it, pal.

07:20.918 --> 07:23.443

07:24.444 --> 07:26.184
What? [sighing] Dude...

Wow. You know, I drew that
on my first night on Earth.

08:01.350 --> 08:03.352
I wanted to remember
where I came from.

08:05.615 --> 08:06.921
I still miss her.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.620
You think Longclaw
would be proud of me?

08:11.578 --> 08:13.318
I know she would, pal.

08:13.493 --> 08:16.539
Because even though you lost her
at such a young age,

08:16.713 --> 08:19.847
you didn't let your pain
change who you are...

08:20.717 --> 08:21.718
in here.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.505
Yeah. In my lungs.

08:27.071 --> 08:28.812
- Or your heart.
- Heart, right.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.597
Yeah, makes more sense.
Not lungs, heart.

08:30.771 --> 08:32.120
That's the thing
about life, Sonic,

08:32.294 --> 08:34.992
it's all about the choices
we make.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.646
You're gonna
make some good ones and,

08:36.820 --> 08:39.257
knowing you,
you're gonna make some bad ones.

08:39.431 --> 08:40.432
But...

08:41.912 --> 08:44.480
as long as you remember
to listen to your heart,

08:44.654 --> 08:46.874
you're gonna
make the right choice
when it matters the most.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.615
Thanks.

of temperature and distance.

43:01.404 --> 43:04.277
And you must be
another stinking hedgehog.

43:04.451 --> 43:06.496
So you're the one
behind all this.

43:06.671 --> 43:08.890
- The Shadow breakout.
- The attack on Walters.

43:09.064 --> 43:10.239
That musty
old-man smell.

43:10.413 --> 43:12.372
How dare you insult me

43:12.546 --> 43:14.200
with your unsolicited
exposition!

43:14.374 --> 43:16.463
Shadow, get the key.

43:16.637 --> 43:17.638
Where is it?

43:17.812 --> 43:19.901
Ha! Good one, Hot Topic.

43:20.075 --> 43:22.164
Do you really think
we'd be that stupid

43:22.338 --> 43:24.384
to bring the key
right to you?

43:24.558 --> 43:25.994
Yep, we're that stupid.

43:26.168 --> 43:28.344
GUN took everything from us.

43:28.518 --> 43:31.434
And now we are going
to take everything from them.

43:31.609 --> 43:32.871
[Gerald] With this.

43:33.045 --> 43:36.701
My masterpiece
of malevolence...

43:36.875 --> 43:39.399
The Eclipse Cannon.

43:39.573 --> 43:42.663
<i>In exchange
for my freedom,</i>

43:42.837 --> 43:44.970
<i>I gave GUN
the most powerful weapon</i>

43:45.144 --> 43:47.668
<i>mankind has ever seen,</i>

43:47.842 --> 43:50.410
<i>capable of delivering
a precision strike</i>

43:50.584 --> 43:51.977
<i>anywhere on Earth.</i>

43:53.413 --> 43:54.632
<i>Our first target:</i>

43:55.458 --> 43:57.112
<i>GUN Headquarters.</i>

43:57.286 --> 43:59.419
But firing a weapon
that powerful

43:59.593 --> 44:01.551
could threaten millions
of innocent lives!

44:01.726 --> 44:03.989
Yeah, tera-bite me.[cackles]

44:04.163 --> 44:09.037
This is one of two keys required
to launch the Eclipse Cannon.

44:09.211 --> 44:11.518
The other is locked
inside GUN headquarters.

44:11.692 --> 44:13.563
Once we have both,

44:13.738 --> 44:16.566
I will take rightful control
of my weapon.

44:16.741 --> 44:18.525
I'm in.

44:25.488 --> 44:26.968
Holy crab!

44:27.142 --> 44:28.753
[Robotnik]
Spacious and crustaceous.

44:29.667 --> 44:30.842
Thank you so much

44:31.016 --> 44:32.670
for inspiring
this little adventure.

44:32.844 --> 44:35.020
It really worked out
for me.

44:35.194 --> 44:38.153
And you wonder why
I have trust issues!

44:39.633 --> 44:41.809
Shadow, wait! Don't do this.

44:41.983 --> 44:43.376
I know you're hurting,

44:43.550 --> 44:46.074
but don't let that change
who you are inside.

44:46.248 --> 44:50.513
I've spent 50 years
reliving what they did to her.

44:50.688 --> 44:53.603
This is who I am inside.

44:59.609 --> 45:03.657
Uh, nice magic marble.
Real scary.

45:06.878 --> 45:08.880
[yelps] That actually
is real scary!

45:10.969 --> 45:12.448
It's a mini black hole!

45:12.622 --> 45:14.973
It's going to suck in
all the matter in this base!

45:18.541 --> 45:20.065
[all yelling]

45:20.239 --> 45:22.154
Fear not, friends.

45:22.850 --> 45:24.722
Even my teeth are muscles!

45:25.374 --> 45:26.332
[Sonic yelps]

45:26.506 --> 45:28.029
[Knuckles growls]

45:30.292 --> 45:32.773
Sonic, try to reach
one of my rings!

45:32.947 --> 45:34.166
[Sonic] Got one.

45:34.340 --> 45:36.559
Check this out. Trick shot!

45:36.734 --> 45:37.952
[grunts]

45:40.259 --> 45:41.739
Come on.

45:43.001 --> 45:44.567
Come on.

45:44.742 --> 45:46.395
Come on.[Knuckles groans]

45:48.006 --> 45:49.703
[both] Come on!

45:50.443 --> 45:51.357
[yells]

45:51.531 --> 45:53.707
[all yelling]

45:59.104 --> 46:01.628
Yeah! Yes!

46:05.327 --> 46:06.328
[Sonic] Yikes.

46:07.634 --> 46:09.418
Somebody better call
Google Maps.

46:10.593 --> 46:13.161
[rumbling faintly]

46:13.335 --> 46:17.470
I've spent years
trying to cleanse
the cosmos

46:17.644 --> 46:21.300
of that spiny,
blue speed freak.

46:21.474 --> 46:23.128
And you did it...

46:24.651 --> 46:26.479
in one afternoon.

46:26.653 --> 46:30.570
There's nothing
we can't destroy
together, my boy.

46:30.744 --> 46:33.616
Charting route to GUN
Headquarters in London, sirs.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.880
ETA four hours.

46:36.054 --> 46:37.359
As the crab flies.

46:37.533 --> 46:39.884
By all accounts,
we're ahead of schedule.

46:40.841 --> 46:42.756
We should take this time

46:42.930 --> 46:44.932
to get to know
each other better.

46:45.106 --> 46:46.847
Wow. What?

46:47.587 --> 46:48.675
You mean...

46:48.849 --> 46:52.113
spend some
qua-qua-quality time?

46:52.287 --> 46:57.031
You've waited for this
your whole life.

46:57.205 --> 47:03.516
How would you choose
to spend one perfect day
with your new grand pal?

47:15.354 --> 47:16.659
[elbow thuds][grunts]

47:17.573 --> 47:19.097
[both screaming]

47:19.271 --> 47:21.099
["Wouldn't It Be Nice"
by the Beach Boys playing]

47:21.839 --> 47:23.144
[bell dinging]

47:26.582 --> 47:27.366
[yelps]

47:27.540 --> 47:28.497
[wincing groan]

47:47.777 --> 47:48.735
[shrieks happily]

47:57.396 --> 48:00.703
Ooh! [chortling]

48:00.878 --> 48:03.619
[rockets whistle and explode]

48:14.935 --> 48:16.719

48:18.417 --> 48:21.420
[song resumes]

48:28.514 --> 48:29.994
[song ends]

48:39.525 --> 48:40.961
And done!

48:41.135 --> 48:43.877
Masterpiece.
- Look at that.
- Yay!

48:44.051 --> 48:47.489
It's really been great
having time to ourselves.

48:47.663 --> 48:50.101
Right. Absolutely.
I just feel so...

48:50.275 --> 48:51.667
relaxed, you know?
Clearheaded.

48:51.841 --> 48:54.148
Mmm, look at all these
new interests we found.

48:54.322 --> 48:56.324
- I know, so many hobbies.
- So many!

48:56.498 --> 48:59.327
After the action and adventure
of the last few years,

48:59.501 --> 49:01.721
- well, I could get used to this.
- Same.

49:01.895 --> 49:03.897
[deep rumbling]

49:07.466 --> 49:09.816
[Sonic] Tom! Maddie!
We need your help on a super--

49:09.990 --> 49:12.819
- Knuckles, do you mind?
- Oh! Excuse me.

49:12.993 --> 49:14.429
Tom! Maddie! We need your help

49:14.603 --> 49:16.127
on a super-dangerous
top-secret mission!

49:16.301 --> 49:17.345
Hmm.

49:19.086 --> 49:20.740
- Thank God. Yeah, we're in.
- Let's go.

49:20.914 --> 49:23.134
Really? You're in?
Just like that?

49:23.308 --> 49:26.050
Yes. It was getting so boring
- without you guys here.
- Yeah. So...

49:26.224 --> 49:27.877
No offense....boring. No, none taken.

49:28.052 --> 49:29.531
I mean, whatever crazy plan
you're cooking up,

49:29.705 --> 49:31.011
- the answer's yes.
- Yes.

49:31.185 --> 49:34.145
Great. But first things first:
What is that?

49:34.319 --> 49:35.798
Oh! This is...

49:35.973 --> 49:37.409
[in puppet voice]
...Li'l Tom!

49:37.583 --> 49:39.063
[normal voice]
Isn't he great?

49:40.629 --> 49:42.849
I told you
to get rid of that.
It's very creepy.

49:43.023 --> 49:44.198
[puppet voice]
I told him to get rid of you.

49:44.372 --> 49:45.765
[normal voice]
Okay, that's, mmm...

49:45.939 --> 49:48.159
- crossing a line there.
- You are in so much trouble.

49:50.248 --> 49:52.990
Okay, this is it.
The belly of the beast.

49:53.164 --> 49:55.427
GUN Headquarters in London.

49:55.601 --> 49:58.560
[gasps] Tom, we're finally gonna
get to see London together.

49:58.734 --> 50:00.693
Hey, I told you we'd
get there someday, baby.

50:00.867 --> 50:02.564
Okay. So here's the plan.

50:02.738 --> 50:04.784
<i>I run in superfast,</i>

50:04.958 --> 50:06.916
<i>fly over that water,
no problem,</i>

50:07.091 --> 50:08.396
<i>and right when I get to the--</i>

50:09.789 --> 50:11.443
[shrieks]
What just happened?

50:11.617 --> 50:12.966
Congratulations.

50:13.140 --> 50:15.142
You just got incinerated
by their energy shield.

50:15.316 --> 50:18.928
We'll need to shut it down
by planting a USB drive
in their server room

50:19.103 --> 50:21.322
<i>that will give me full control
over it.</i>

50:21.496 --> 50:23.107
That's what we need you two for.

50:23.281 --> 50:24.978
Couple of badass spies,
that's what we are.

50:25.152 --> 50:26.675
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

50:26.849 --> 50:28.503
[Tails] <i>Once we
disable the shield,</i>

50:28.677 --> 50:30.505
<i>you'll face the laser hall.</i>

50:30.679 --> 50:32.290
[grunts]

50:32.464 --> 50:35.728
<i>These high-density bad boys
will cut you into tiny pieces.</i>

50:37.208 --> 50:39.732
<i>And cut those pieces
into even tinier pieces!</i>

50:39.906 --> 50:41.995
Once again... [shrieks]

50:42.169 --> 50:44.389
Can't we just get Tom Cruise
to do this?[Tails] Nope.

50:44.563 --> 50:48.175
<i>Because not even he
could break into... the vault.</i>

50:48.349 --> 50:49.785
[Sonic]
<i>Why is it empty in there?</i>

50:49.959 --> 50:51.396
[Tails]
<i>Because we have no idea</i>

50:51.570 --> 50:53.050
<i>what's on the other side
of that door.</i>

50:53.224 --> 50:55.704
<i>To prevent the vault from ever
being accessed by a ring,</i>

50:55.878 --> 50:58.838
<i>all images and schematics have
been wiped from GUN's database.</i>

50:59.012 --> 51:01.058
So for the last leg
of this heist...

51:02.320 --> 51:04.278
[in puppet voice]
...we're going in blind.

51:08.978 --> 51:10.197
Sorry.

51:10.371 --> 51:11.894
[Maddie] Okay,
I'm just gonna say it.

51:12.069 --> 51:14.462
It sounds like this plan would
work a heck of a lot better

51:14.636 --> 51:18.162
if Sonic used the Master Emerald
to go Golden God mode

51:18.336 --> 51:19.554
to get the key.

51:20.642 --> 51:22.166
No way, Maddie.

51:22.340 --> 51:24.298
The Master Emerald
is too powerful
to ever use again.

51:24.472 --> 51:26.779
We made a promise to each other
to keep it hidden.

51:26.953 --> 51:29.086
In a location
only Knuckles knows.

51:29.260 --> 51:31.436
As guardian
of the Master Emerald,

51:31.610 --> 51:34.482
anyone who tries
to take it away
for any reason...

51:34.656 --> 51:36.963
will become a sworn enemy.

51:37.137 --> 51:38.878
Okay, okay! Sheesh!

51:39.052 --> 51:40.662
No need to get
all growly on me, buddy.

51:40.836 --> 51:43.970
You guys are always telling us
to make good choices.

51:44.144 --> 51:45.885
Well, this is the right choice.

51:46.059 --> 51:47.626
Okay.

51:47.800 --> 51:50.107
I guess
we're going to...

51:50.281 --> 51:53.719
["London Town"
by Mr Eazi playing]

52:05.687 --> 52:07.515
London, baby!

52:10.779 --> 52:13.304
GUN Headquarters
is right there.

52:13.478 --> 52:17.438
Let me go in, get the key
and destroy anyone in my way!

52:17.612 --> 52:19.179
I want revenge.

52:19.353 --> 52:20.702
[Gerald]
Patience, Shadow.

52:20.876 --> 52:23.140
Just let us handle this...

52:24.141 --> 52:27.448
and I promise
you'll have revenge

52:27.622 --> 52:31.365
on a scale you couldn't
possibly imagine.

52:31.539 --> 52:34.542
Come on, Granddaddy-O,
we've got...

52:34.716 --> 52:35.761
dirt to do!

52:35.935 --> 52:37.719
Suits.

52:37.893 --> 52:38.894
Right here, sir.

52:39.939 --> 52:41.810
Stone, babysit the hedgehog.

52:41.984 --> 52:44.422
Keep the crab on a low boil.

52:45.597 --> 52:47.903
It's time
for more family bonding.

52:52.691 --> 52:54.171
Come on, Shadow.

52:54.345 --> 52:58.262
Got fresh avocados in the crab.
We'll make guac.

53:00.002 --> 53:01.830
Revenge guac!

53:09.751 --> 53:13.799
Guys, are you ready for me yet?
I've been waiting here all day.

53:16.584 --> 53:19.413
Sonic,
we literally just started.

53:19.587 --> 53:21.807
Tom, Maddie,
are you in position and ready?

53:21.981 --> 53:24.113
- We were born ready.
- Let's do this.

53:24.288 --> 53:25.506
[Tails]
<i>Knuckles, how about you?</i>

53:25.680 --> 53:27.813
I have taken my perch
atop the giant clock.

53:27.987 --> 53:30.642
Now, where is this glass
I'm supposed to break?

53:30.816 --> 53:32.296
Actually, Knucks, your job

53:32.470 --> 53:34.776
is to "Break Glass
in Case of Emergency."

53:34.950 --> 53:36.474
Understood.

53:36.648 --> 53:39.868
I will shatter this glass
like the jaw of a vile foe.

53:40.042 --> 53:41.957
In case of emergency.

53:42.131 --> 53:44.830
<i>I will pulverize it like
the skull of a loathsome rival!</i>

53:45.004 --> 53:48.094
Just to be clear,
the "emergency"
is the important part.

53:48.268 --> 53:49.922
The glass will beg for mercy

53:50.096 --> 53:52.403
under the shadow
of my mighty fist!

53:52.577 --> 53:54.013
Guys, remember,
we're a team.

53:54.187 --> 53:55.536
- Let's focus.
- Please.

53:55.710 --> 53:56.885
[Sonic] <i>You know what?
Let's move on.</i>

53:57.059 --> 53:58.887
All right,
everyone knows what to do.

53:59.061 --> 54:01.150
Tom and Maddie,
you guys plant the USB drive.

54:01.325 --> 54:03.849
I'll disable the traps.
Sonic will snag the launch key.

54:04.023 --> 54:05.764
And Knuckles, you stand by to--

54:05.938 --> 54:08.288
Break glass in case
of emergency.

54:08.462 --> 54:09.681
See? He gets it.

54:09.855 --> 54:11.204
Then we're all set.

54:11.378 --> 54:12.945
Hologram time.

54:14.512 --> 54:15.426
You go first.

54:17.558 --> 54:19.256
Tom, it's me, Rachel!

54:19.430 --> 54:21.258
Can you believe it?
We're both in London together.

54:21.432 --> 54:23.216
Have you met your sister?
Try again.

54:23.390 --> 54:24.435
Unless...

54:24.609 --> 54:26.393
you're not
up for this mission.

54:26.567 --> 54:28.787
Yeah, maybe you want
to be back in Green Hills,
baking sourdough.

54:28.961 --> 54:30.615
- Thomas Michael Wachowski!
- Gah!

54:30.789 --> 54:32.225
You brought aliens
to my wedding,

54:32.399 --> 54:34.227
punched out my husband
and buried me in an avalanche.

54:34.401 --> 54:36.316
Your day of reckoning
is at hand!

54:36.490 --> 54:37.491
Yeah, that's perfect.

54:37.665 --> 54:40.102
Okay, now for
her better half.

54:41.887 --> 54:46.674
Ho-ho, my name is Randall,
and I am too much to handle!

54:46.848 --> 54:48.502
Welcome to the gun show!

54:48.676 --> 54:51.723

Don't talk to me about oaths.
Not now!

01:13:43.854 --> 01:13:45.725
But you told Tom
using the Emerald

01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:47.335
wasn't the right choice.

Don't do this.

01:14:27.724 --> 01:14:30.683
Part of our oath
is to trust each other.

01:14:30.857 --> 01:14:33.077

to break it.

Good work, Shadow.

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:12.982
I'm prepping
the firing sequence.

01:20:13.156 --> 01:20:17.029
The weapon will be fully charged
in ten minutes.

01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:23.079
It's almost finished, Maria.

01:20:23.993 --> 01:20:26.343
You will have justice.

01:20:26.517 --> 01:20:28.127

01:20:30.738 --> 01:20:32.044
What is that?

01:20:32.958 --> 01:20:35.918
Is GUN launching
missiles at us?

01:20:36.092 --> 01:20:39.138
Impossible.
It's moving too fast.

You hurt my family.
This ends now!

01:20:56.852 --> 01:20:58.549
Now you know my anger.

01:20:58.723 --> 01:21:01.595
The pain I've felt
for 50 years.

01:21:01.769 --> 01:21:05.034
And you've made
the same choice I did.

01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.774
I'm nothing like you!

01:21:06.949 --> 01:21:08.037
We'll see.

Where are they?

01:22:25.157 --> 01:22:26.419
- Up there.
- Where?

01:22:26.593 --> 01:22:27.507
- Higher.
- Hmm?

01:22:27.681 --> 01:22:29.074
[shocked gagging]

01:22:29.248 --> 01:22:30.510
Left yourself open.

01:22:30.684 --> 01:22:32.469
Ivo! What are you doing?

01:22:32.643 --> 01:22:34.036

[mocking]
Oh... a nano-fist.

01:22:58.408 --> 01:23:02.107
I haven't seen that
since I hate-watched
<i>Green Lantern</i> in 2011.

01:23:02.281 --> 01:23:04.240
I was saving it for Comic-Con.

01:23:04.414 --> 01:23:06.459
But now there won't
be a Comic-Con!

01:23:36.576 --> 01:23:38.056
But you came anyway.

01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:40.667
Your anger was too much.

01:23:40.841 --> 01:23:43.583
What kind of hero
abandons his friends

01:23:43.757 --> 01:23:45.803
to pursue revenge?

01:23:45.977 --> 01:23:48.284
Abandons his family!

01:23:48.458 --> 01:23:51.069
Don't you dare talk
about my family.

01:23:51.243 --> 01:23:53.985
And here I thought
you cared for them.

01:23:54.159 --> 01:23:57.293
Especially the one...
What's his name?

01:23:57.467 --> 01:23:58.685
Tom?

01:24:31.675 --> 01:24:34.243

I'm right here!

01:24:35.418 --> 01:24:37.550
You didn't let your pain
change who you are...

in here.

01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:43.904
[whimpering sigh]

01:24:48.474 --> 01:24:50.433
This is not who I am.

01:24:51.129 --> 01:24:52.783
What are you doing?

01:24:52.957 --> 01:24:55.829
You won. Take your revenge.

01:24:57.701 --> 01:24:59.833
There are no winners
with revenge.

01:25:13.151 --> 01:25:14.892
[Maria] <i>Wow.</i>

01:25:15.066 --> 01:25:16.502

Look at all those stars.

<i>They're like diamonds.</i>

01:25:21.855 --> 01:25:25.207
The last time I sat
beneath stars like this...

01:25:27.209 --> 01:25:28.775
I was with her.

01:25:30.342 --> 01:25:32.866
I've felt this pain for so long.

01:25:34.564 --> 01:25:36.261
It's all I know.

01:25:36.435 --> 01:25:38.655
When I lost Longclaw...

01:25:38.829 --> 01:25:40.526
I felt the same way.

01:25:42.311 --> 01:25:44.748
Did your pain eventually
go away?

01:25:44.922 --> 01:25:46.880
No.

01:25:47.054 --> 01:25:48.969
But in time,
I learned there's something

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:51.450
even more powerful than pain.

01:25:51.624 --> 01:25:53.713
The love we felt for each other.

01:25:54.932 --> 01:25:56.760
That's what you need
to hold on to, Shadow.

01:25:56.934 --> 01:25:59.154
Maria might be gone,

01:25:59.328 --> 01:26:01.330

will always remain.

[cannon rumbling in distance]

01:26:31.838 --> 01:26:33.753
This whole mess
is my fault.

01:26:33.927 --> 01:26:36.756
I've been so blinded by rage,
I thought...

01:26:37.453 --> 01:26:39.237
I had no choice.

01:26:42.762 --> 01:26:45.156
You always have a choice.

01:26:50.117 --> 01:26:52.859
But making the right one
is never easy.

01:26:53.033 --> 01:26:54.731
One more thing I learned

01:26:54.905 --> 01:26:57.690
is that when you
really screw something up,

01:26:57.864 --> 01:26:59.344
you can't fix it
on your own.

for Earth?

01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:30.795
A radioactive atmosphere.

01:34:30.969 --> 01:34:33.450
Rain that kills the crops
and melts your flesh.

01:34:33.624 --> 01:34:34.886
Other than that...

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:36.714
We're not done here!

01:34:36.888 --> 01:34:38.803
You try to stabilize
the reactor.

01:34:38.977 --> 01:34:40.196
Buy me some time.

01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:42.415
I'll push the station
away from Earth

01:34:42.589 --> 01:34:44.026
before it explodes.

01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:48.204
This is our last chance
to do the right thing.

01:34:49.858 --> 01:34:52.469

01:34:52.643 --> 01:34:54.863

01:35:07.614 --> 01:35:09.268
I've got you, Sonic!

[computer] <i>Initializing
reactor core stabilizers.</i>

01:36:04.715 --> 01:36:07.413
This is Doctor Ivo Robotnik,

01:36:07.587 --> 01:36:10.329
dedicating my final livestream

01:36:10.503 --> 01:36:13.245
to one very special henchman:

01:36:13.855 --> 01:36:15.247
<i>Agent Stone.</i>

01:36:15.421 --> 01:36:17.641
No, no. Doctor, wait!

<i>If I can't
rule the world...</i>

01:36:21.210 --> 01:36:23.038
I might as well save it...

01:36:23.212 --> 01:36:26.345
for the one and only person
who ever cared about me.

01:36:26.519 --> 01:36:28.434
Don't do this, Doctor, please!

01:36:28.608 --> 01:36:32.221
Stone, you were more
than a sycophant to me.

01:36:35.093 --> 01:36:36.355
You were...

01:36:37.835 --> 01:36:39.358
a syco-friend.

01:36:44.929 --> 01:36:48.454
I'll miss your lattes
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

01:36:50.413 --> 01:36:52.284
I love the way you make 'em!

01:37:35.371 --> 01:37:39.201
So... I guess there's
only one thing left to say.

01:37:39.984 --> 01:37:42.421
[mimics robotic servos]

01:37:43.988 --> 01:37:45.468
It's been a real drag.

01:37:46.164 --> 01:37:47.644
Thanks for nothing.

01:37:59.830 --> 01:38:01.440
[birds chirping faintly]

01:38:03.399 --> 01:38:04.966
[coughing]

01:38:06.228 --> 01:38:07.403
Sonic, look.

01:38:17.630 --> 01:38:19.502
Shadow and Robotnik.

01:38:19.676 --> 01:38:21.896
They sacrificed
themselves...

01:38:22.070 --> 01:38:24.072
to save everyone.

01:38:24.811 --> 01:38:26.857
You always have a choice.

01:38:28.119 --> 01:38:30.861
Guys, I'm really sorry
for running off like that.

01:38:31.035 --> 01:38:32.645
I shouldn't have
left you behind.

01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:36.040
The truth is...

01:38:36.214 --> 01:38:38.869
you're the best teammates
a hedgehog could ever ask for.

01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:42.438
And the best friends.

01:38:42.612 --> 01:38:44.483
Can you ever forgive me?

01:38:48.574 --> 01:38:50.359
Team Sonic?

01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:57.061
[Sonic]
How about just "team"?

01:39:05.374 --> 01:39:06.984
Goodbye, Doctor.

01:39:23.522 --> 01:39:25.829
[Sonic] Big finish.[Knuckles] Mmm!

01:39:27.352 --> 01:39:29.789
Now that's
what I call teamwork.

01:39:29.964 --> 01:39:31.748
Okay! It's ready!

01:39:31.922 --> 01:39:33.402
[munching]

01:39:33.576 --> 01:39:34.751
[gasps]

01:39:34.925 --> 01:39:36.579
Knuckles,
how could you?

01:39:36.753 --> 01:39:38.581
Gotta be faster than that!

01:39:39.495 --> 01:39:40.583
Give me a break.

01:39:40.757 --> 01:39:42.063
Still moving a little slow
over here.

01:39:42.237 --> 01:39:44.021
- Donut Lord!
- Yay!

01:39:44.195 --> 01:39:45.718
[pained groan]

01:39:45.892 --> 01:39:48.547
Okay, Knuckles, that's... I am having the love.

01:39:48.721 --> 01:39:50.071
[barks]
I want the love!

01:39:50.245 --> 01:39:52.943
[Tails] Aww... Get in here, Ozzy.

01:39:53.117 --> 01:39:54.814
It's great
to be back together.

01:39:54.989 --> 01:39:56.816
We're stronger than ever.

01:39:56.991 --> 01:39:59.428
And nothing is gonna
stand in our way.

01:40:00.777 --> 01:40:04.607
Except that one piece
of unfinished business.

01:40:13.659 --> 01:40:16.662
And way out in front, to the
surprise of absolutely no one,

01:40:16.836 --> 01:40:18.012
it's the Blue Blur!

01:40:18.186 --> 01:40:19.926
Often imitated,
never duplicated,

01:40:20.101 --> 01:40:21.319
the one, the only...

01:40:22.407 --> 01:40:23.887
Let's do this!

01:40:24.061 --> 01:40:26.237
Yeah! [laughs]

01:40:26.411 --> 01:40:29.501
[yells]
All right, boys,
try and keep up.

01:40:30.198 --> 01:40:32.069
[all cheering, whooping]

Knuckles?

01:42:34.887 --> 01:42:37.847
Okay. Yeah, I overshot
the finish line.

01:42:41.764 --> 01:42:43.244
[electronic whirring]

01:42:46.769 --> 01:42:49.772
[Sonic] Okay,
so how do I get back?

at the fastest creature

01:43:08.312 --> 01:43:09.922
you'd better not miss.

01:43:13.752 --> 01:43:16.364
Um... I'm flattered
by the cosplay,

01:43:16.538 --> 01:43:18.235
but you got
a few details wrong.

01:43:18.409 --> 01:43:21.282
I can't blame you, though.
It's hard to copy perfection.

01:43:31.379 --> 01:43:33.381
That's a neat trick.

[Sonic yelps]

01:43:45.306 --> 01:43:47.221
