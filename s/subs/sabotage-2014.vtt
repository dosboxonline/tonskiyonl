02:08.562 --> 02:10.405
Don't blow your balls off, okay.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.410
Hey' don't worry.
They're made of brass.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.002
Are they as big as your wife's?

02:17.070 --> 02:18.811
Who the fuck dropped ass?

02:18.939 --> 02:21.852
That was me. Better check
your fucking drawers.

02:21.942 --> 02:23.580
I think that was brisket, wasn't it?
Wasn't that brisket?

02:23.644 --> 02:24.987
Open a fucking window!

02:25.078 --> 02:28.753
Hey, shut the fuck up!
Concentrate! It's payday.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.007
Hell, yeah.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.280
Look at you.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.018
Done a roll call?

02:59.112 --> 03:00.792
Breacher and his men
are all accounted for.

03:01.848 --> 03:02.952
How much is in there?

03:03.050 --> 03:04.529
We're about to find out.

03:04.618 --> 03:06.529
DC will be very happy.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.122

03:08.188 --> 03:09.667
<i>MAN 21 Acknowledge.</i>

to hit you fucking raw.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.082
Okay. Come here, baby!

03:36.149 --> 03:37.594
Come on.

03:37.684 --> 03:39.994
All right, come on.

03:41.688 --> 03:43.895
Lizzy, radio check.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.697
Do you copy me?

03:46.326 --> 03:48.033
I hear nothing!

03:48.095 --> 03:49.135
What are you talking about?

03:49.162 --> 03:52.371
I can only hear your
heartbeat. Come on!

03:53.667 --> 03:56.204
God damn it, Lizzy!
Do you copy me?

03:56.269 --> 03:58.010
Bad call, boss, sending her in.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.573
Oh, relax.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.846
She knows how to take
care of her business.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.082
I got movement.

04:08.181 --> 04:09.558
Second story, front window.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.523
Center lock.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.124
I'm taking the shot.

04:31.204 --> 04:33.324
Here we go!
Let's move, let's move!

04:37.043 --> 04:38.723
Come on! Move it!
Stack it up. Stack it up.

Para!

04:46.253 --> 04:47.664
Shots fired.
Delta side.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.962
- Neck, stay close with me!
- Already out!

04:51.424 --> 04:53.836
Hey! Hey, where's my shit?
I'm going in!

04:53.960 --> 04:56.133
You're not going in! I know
where the money is! Do you?

04:56.229 --> 04:57.674
Let's go long!

04:57.764 --> 05:00.176
Fuck, Lizzy!
You look hot, baby! Whoa!

05:00.500 --> 05:01.843
Stack up.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.414
Pyro, get the window! On it.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.742
Let's go.

05:10.811 --> 05:11.983
Tripod, clear.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.480
Breach. Breach!

05:15.816 --> 05:17.056
Get in there!
Move it!

05:17.117 --> 05:19.256
- I got high!
- Okay, I got back!

05:19.319 --> 05:20.457
Come on, y'all!

05:20.587 --> 05:21.691

05:21.788 --> 05:22.960
Cut the lock.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.661
<i>Lizzy, there's a fucking gate!</i>

05:24.758 --> 05:26.829
No shit. Take this.
Got it.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.766
- Anybody hurt'?
- I'm good.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.176
Tripod! Demo!

05:42.609 --> 05:43.849
Aw, shit,
I think I broke a nail.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.897
Double up!
Give me the charge.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.613
- What are we doing, boss?
- Demo set.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.954
Three, two, one!

05:54.621 --> 05:55.861

Good shot! Dead.

Get moving!

06:00.360 --> 06:01.395
Get inside!

06:01.494 --> 06:03.254
- Breaching shotgun!
- Pop it!

06:04.564 --> 06:05.634
Move it!

06:05.699 --> 06:06.700
Lizzy,
where's the money?

06:06.833 --> 06:07.834
Down that hall.

06:08.501 --> 06:09.980
Spider hole
in the ceiling.

06:13.406 --> 06:14.646
Target down!
Move it!

06:14.708 --> 06:15.880
- Watch your head.
- Good shot.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.353
- Popped his gray.
- Meat shower.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.079
Target.

06:20.513 --> 06:21.874
- Down!
- Let's move!

06:25.018 --> 06:26.588
Saw shit
like this in Iraq.

06:26.686 --> 06:27.994
Door is on the right.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.362
Stand clear!

06:29.990 --> 06:32.436
Moving up. Everyone, get
out of my fucking way!

06:35.161 --> 06:36.522
Kick it,
Tripod, let's go!

06:40.033 --> 06:41.273
- Keep it tight!
- I'll take the back.

06:41.368 --> 06:42.489
Pyro, I'm behind you.

06:42.535 --> 06:45.072
- Cover your sides!
- You got it, boss!

06:46.006 --> 06:47.417
Clear.
Let's move.

06:47.507 --> 06:49.111
Clear. Clear.
Move it up.

06:49.209 --> 06:51.052
Look what
Mama did for you.

06:51.778 --> 06:55.692
Holy shit. Uncle Sam gets his.
It's time to get ours.

06:56.283 --> 06:59.025
Come on,
kids, let's get paid.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.462
I guess you blew
the right scumbag.

07:00.587 --> 07:01.964
I guess I did.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.634
You're going to make me sick.
Let's go.

07:04.724 --> 07:05.896
Come on, Monster, let's go!

07:06.026 --> 07:07.130
On it, boss.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.900
Neck!
Bags, some rope!

07:09.029 --> 07:10.702
Yeah. Bags over here.

07:10.897 --> 07:11.967
Rope, bags!

07:12.098 --> 07:13.659
We've got three minutes.
Rope!

07:13.700 --> 07:15.475
Smoke, cut that shit!

07:16.136 --> 07:18.138
Really? Really?

07:21.408 --> 07:24.218
<i>Breacher, it's Watcher.
What's the delay?</i>

07:24.577 --> 07:26.488
Well, we're cutting
through an obstacle' sir.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.657
It's going to take a while.
Roger that.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.052
Incoming.

07:30.116 --> 07:32.756
Need any help? Negative.
We have active shooters.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.056
<i>So just hold back
until it's all clear.</i>

07:36.723 --> 07:38.293
Who wipes their ass
and puts the toilet paper

07:38.391 --> 07:40.302
on the outside of
the fucking bowl?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.235
Hey, get the water
line off the toilet.

07:42.495 --> 07:44.270
- Hurry the fuck up!
- We're working on it.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.118
Today, Monster.
Come on, hurry up, guys. Let's go.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.737
Incoming.
Three, two...

07:51.071 --> 07:52.277
Two mikes and we're through.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.341
Two minutes.
Oh, God!

07:54.474 --> 07:55.851
What's taking you so fucking long?
Go, go, go.

07:55.942 --> 07:57.683
Let's go,
I want more money.

07:58.945 --> 08:00.253
You're getting somewhere now.

08:00.347 --> 08:01.621
Here you go, babe.

08:05.251 --> 08:06.457
Fuck!

08:07.287 --> 08:08.493
- Fuck!
- What happened?

08:08.588 --> 08:10.261
- Man down!
- Who's down?

08:10.323 --> 08:11.324
Smoke's been hit!

08:11.458 --> 08:12.459
God damn it!
How'd that happen?

08:12.625 --> 08:14.798
Smoke Jennings is down!
Taking fire! Son of a bitch!

08:15.028 --> 08:16.939
Medical, stand by.
We may have a problem.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.442
Neck, render aid.
I got it.

08:18.531 --> 08:20.340
Get your man out of there.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.707
Tripod, get in the rig!
Stay with me.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.314
Monster, hurry up.

08:24.637 --> 08:26.378
Monster! Let's go.
We need more money!

08:26.473 --> 08:27.884
Breacher, the dude's fucked up!

08:27.974 --> 08:29.180
Not getting paid
ain't gonna help him.

08:29.275 --> 08:30.481
Yeah? Now we're
just like them!

08:30.610 --> 08:33.523
Shut your fucking mouth! This
isn't what we fucking do!

08:33.613 --> 08:34.614
I'll take your out.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.284
Shut the fuck up!
Do your job!

08:36.783 --> 08:39.195
Hang in there.
Just a little hickey, baby.

08:39.284 --> 08:40.525
Keep the
money coming!

08:41.855 --> 08:44.631
Come on, Breacher.
Come on, come on, come on.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.295
- One mike!
- Fuck, open your eyes!

08:46.359 --> 08:48.236
- How's he doing?
- He's cleaned up.

08:48.361 --> 08:51.342
We gotta move him, boss! Get him
out of here now. Get him up.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.502
A little help, Grinder!

08:52.565 --> 08:53.908
<i>Breacher?
Breacher, give me status.</i>

08:54.034 --> 08:55.377
Stand by.

08:56.803 --> 08:58.976
I have men coming out.
Call up Medical.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.575
<i>Are you
in the money room?</i>

09:00.673 --> 09:02.050
Let's go!

09:02.142 --> 09:03.815
Come on, come on.
Get some more, get some more.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.254
Lizzy,
how much money do we got?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.755
About$10 million.

09:06.813 --> 09:09.384
That's enough. Go and help Monster.
On it!

09:09.482 --> 09:11.428
- Okay, Tripod.
<i>- John.</i>

09:11.751 --> 09:13.196
Come on,
come on, come on.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.266
Moving it in.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.494
Last spark.

09:18.491 --> 09:19.561
Our man is out.
Let's go.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.332
- Ifs in. It's in.
- Go, go, go! Move!

09:21.394 --> 09:23.567
<i>God damn it, John!
Talk to me.</i>

09:23.663 --> 09:26.200
We're through.
All right, stack up.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.378
Team, move.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.062
Monster, stay left.
Heads on the swivel.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.346
Coming out.

09:58.798 --> 10:01.608
All right,
who dropped ass?

10:01.701 --> 10:02.975
Holy shit!

10:04.237 --> 10:05.375
Fuck!

10:07.107 --> 10:08.211
Stop splashing!

10:08.374 --> 10:09.444
Here we go.

10:10.477 --> 10:11.979
Come on, boys.

10:12.412 --> 10:13.482
This better
be worth it!

10:13.613 --> 10:15.053
Fucking nasty.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.258
Fuck.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.460
- Shit.
- What?

10:23.990 --> 10:25.298
Where's the
fucking money?

10:26.226 --> 10:27.603
Are you fucking
kidding me right now?

10:27.727 --> 10:28.967
What'? We
should check in the water.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.473
- What'd she say?
- Check in the water.

10:30.730 --> 10:31.765
The fucking
money's gone.

10:31.831 --> 10:32.969
What the fuck you mean,
check the water?

10:33.099 --> 10:34.237
Right behind you.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.109
What happened
with the money?

10:36.169 --> 10:38.479
What do you mean
there's no fucking money?

10:38.571 --> 10:40.175
Look at the rope.

10:40.673 --> 10:41.674
It's been cut.

10:41.774 --> 10:44.152
Just check down there.
Check down here.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.155
Oh, fucking shit.

10:46.246 --> 10:47.691
Who the fuck else
knew about this shit?

10:47.780 --> 10:48.781
Come on.

10:48.848 --> 10:51.328
It's not in the fucking water,
man! It's not in the fucking water!

10:51.417 --> 10:52.418
No fucking way!

10:52.485 --> 10:53.589
Who fucking
cut the rope?

10:53.653 --> 10:56.759
Why don't you all just
shut the fuck up and let's go?

10:58.525 --> 11:00.630
Hold up, you guys.
Hold up.

11:02.195 --> 11:03.333
What the fuck is that?

11:03.630 --> 11:04.665
Bullet.

11:04.764 --> 11:06.266
We just wasted
our whole fucking career

11:06.432 --> 11:07.968
for this shit and
there's nothing here?

11:08.034 --> 11:09.395
This ain't good.
Let's walk.

11:09.435 --> 11:10.675
Check the water.

11:10.770 --> 11:13.114
We sold ourselves out for this.

11:25.718 --> 11:27.220
<i>We got a little problem.</i>

11:27.720 --> 11:30.701
$10 million is missing.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.134
Now listen. You all
did a fine job in there.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.966
We're not arguing that you've
got a good record with the DEA.

11:37.564 --> 11:38.975
None of that matters right now,

11:39.032 --> 11:42.912
'cause all we need to do is find
out where that $10 million is.

11:43.002 --> 11:44.640
And that's why you're here.

11:44.804 --> 11:46.579
It was a big, giant
fucking stack of money.

11:46.673 --> 11:49.473
How do you know, exactly down to the
dollar, how much was in that room?

11:50.476 --> 11:51.477
Well, the FBI was

11:51.544 --> 11:53.649
carrying on
a parallel investigation.

11:53.846 --> 11:55.167
Did you ever see
the $200 million?

11:55.515 --> 11:58.325
Did you guys hear me
say I want my lawyer?

11:58.751 --> 12:01.891
You know what would clear your ass?
If you'd take a polygraph.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.393
No poly-
No poly?

12:04.657 --> 12:07.263
That's weak.
That's sad.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.862
Your ass is going to prison.

12:10.830 --> 12:12.571
When money is supposed to
be there and it goes away,

12:12.665 --> 12:14.338
and it looks like to us,
it was a setup.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.346
It may not be, and we're
going to find out.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.940
And I know you had
a friend who died.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.279
And that's awful, and it's
going to be more awful

12:21.374 --> 12:22.751
if it was because of money.

12:22.842 --> 12:25.015
My friend did not die
for fucking $10 million.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.757
We lost a man,
we lost a brother.

12:28.047 --> 12:29.754
And you don't give
a shit about that.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.419
It was Wharton's
idea, wasn't it?

12:33.519 --> 12:36.193
You were just following the
lead of a respected supervisor.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.097
I mean, John is like your daddy.

12:38.224 --> 12:39.931
You were doing
what you had to do.

12:40.026 --> 12:42.438
Fuck you.
You don't know my daddy.

12:42.862 --> 12:45.433
This agency saved your ass.
You were going nowhere.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.700
You were a question
mark coming in here.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.872
And you have been better
than any of us ever dreamed.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.539
And you've always outperformed.

12:52.872 --> 12:54.749
We're trying to
save that career.

12:54.807 --> 12:57.253
This is your family, Joe.
This is your family.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.252
See, I'm not a thief.

13:02.949 --> 13:06.260
If that cartel finds out that
you took $10 million,

13:07.654 --> 13:10.897
they're going to slit your
throat from ear to ear.

14:01.541 --> 14:03.179
I gotta pee, man.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.382
Say what?
I gotta piss.

14:05.545 --> 14:06.615
Then go pee.

14:06.779 --> 14:10.352
Man, he got cameras all over.
There's no way I can go.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.454
Oh, dude, really?

14:12.885 --> 14:14.865
Piss, man. What the hell?
What you think?

14:15.121 --> 14:16.122
I'm not going to stick my dick

14:16.189 --> 14:18.294
where your dick been sticking in, man.
I ain't putting it in there.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.201
Yeah, the problem is, your
shit probably fit in there.

14:20.293 --> 14:23.137
My shit don't fit in there. I need a
thermos or some shit. Look at this.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.097
You threw a bottle
of piss in my lap.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.973
Man, it's got
a cap on it.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.668
Morning, Breach.
Morning.

14:28.735 --> 14:30.408
Hey, good morning.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.645
Oh, man, thanks, Breach!

14:33.039 --> 14:34.160
Breakfast of champions, huh?

14:34.207 --> 14:36.744
Here's your DVD, man.
Appreciate it.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.546
And don't piss in
my bushes anymore, okay?

14:39.812 --> 14:42.190
I have a surveillance camera.
I see it all.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.319
No, that was him.
I've got a bottle.

14:47.353 --> 14:48.491
I'm not using that bottle.

14:48.554 --> 14:51.034
I ain't sticking my dick nowhere
your dick has been, damn that.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.593
You didn't say
that about Rebecca.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.261
When you fuck Rebecca?

14:54.360 --> 14:55.998
I fuck them all.
Bro.

14:56.062 --> 14:58.440
Just follow that truck.
I'm gonna deal with you.

15:16.349 --> 15:17.453
So you
think he did it?

15:17.550 --> 15:20.870
I don't know if he did it. I just
know I hear stuff, that's all I'm saying.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.456
They're looking for something.

15:22.622 --> 15:23.692
But they haven't found anything,

15:23.756 --> 15:25.235
or else we wouldn't be following
him around like this.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.361
Yeah.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.110
Why don't you just
pull the pin on this?

16:43.336 --> 16:46.374
You're never going to be able to
spend that blood money anyway.

16:46.606 --> 16:47.641
Do it for your team.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.352
Do it for your country.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.616
Do it for yourself.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.625
Retire. End it.
End the pain.

16:58.784 --> 17:00.457
Fuck you, Breacher.

17:07.960 --> 17:10.133
I hate it as much
as you do, sir.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.345
Tactical god.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.990
Why don't you wash
your fucking hands?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.155
That's a new suit?

17:30.850 --> 17:34.525
Why do you rock that off-the-rack,
cheap-ass JCPenney shit

17:34.987 --> 17:36.728
when you can afford Armani?

17:36.822 --> 17:38.782
In fact, why aren't you
on a yacht in the Caymans?

17:38.891 --> 17:40.336
I know what you're trying to do.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.404
The jabs, the jokes.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.906
But tell them
I'm not going to bite.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.408
What's! you tell
Smoke Jennings' wife?

17:49.235 --> 17:51.715
That he died for a good
cause, making you rich?

17:54.106 --> 17:56.347
Tell them you let me disarm you.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.746
Give me the fucking gun.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.812
Come in.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.482
Have a seat, John.

18:39.919 --> 18:41.398
It's over.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.091
I'll go and clean out my desk.

18:44.223 --> 18:45.395
I'm not firing you.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.298
The investigation is over.

18:47.893 --> 18:49.167
No ones been exonerated.

18:49.261 --> 18:52.242
DC just lost their appetite.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.968
Who do you know
in Washington, John?

18:56.302 --> 18:58.748
Got a picture of a senator
fucking a goat, maybe?

19:02.808 --> 19:05.812
The only thing anyone in law
enforcement has is their credibility.

19:05.911 --> 19:10.018
Li's like virginity. Once
it's gone, it's gone forever.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.926
When did you lose yours?

19:19.825 --> 19:22.135
What if I gave you
your team back?

19:23.663 --> 19:25.267
Don't fuck with me.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.505
No one wants you, John.

19:27.933 --> 19:29.970
I've got nowhere
else to stick you.

19:30.036 --> 19:32.778
Mind showing some
leadership this time?

19:35.775 --> 19:36.776
Gun.

19:36.842 --> 19:37.946
Badge.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.013
<i>Grads.</i>

19:40.513 --> 19:43.619
There you go.
You're back in the game.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.779
They don't fucking let us train.
They don't let us shoot.

20:07.807 --> 20:09.753
I mean, I can't even carry a
fucking gun in here, dude.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.651
We're sitting on
our <i>asses,</i> rotting.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.418
It's punishment, bro.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.355
Don't let it get in your head.

20:15.414 --> 20:17.189
Just deal with it. lam.

20:17.249 --> 20:18.887
Who's winning?
Get down.

20:18.984 --> 20:21.362
Get the fuck out of the way!

20:21.487 --> 20:23.768
- In the middle of my goddamn game!
- Fuck me!

20:23.856 --> 20:25.494
Country-ass motherfucker!

20:25.591 --> 20:28.003
Why you acting all Jethro on that shit?
You gonna play?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.404
We're reduced to a
fucking rubber gun squad, bro,

20:30.496 --> 20:32.237
I feel like a fucking parolee.

20:32.331 --> 20:34.504
Why is he tattooing a dick
on your back, Pyro?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.773
You know what, bro, this is a
fallen soldier. Fuck you, man.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.069
Will you fucking dial it down?

20:38.070 --> 20:39.413
I just lost a buddy down range!

20:39.505 --> 20:41.849
Easy, easy,
killer. Hell!

20:43.342 --> 20:45.083
It does kind
of look like a dick.

20:47.279 --> 20:48.587
The expert has spoken.

20:49.181 --> 20:50.421
Bro, if I turn around

20:50.516 --> 20:52.621
and see a fucking dick
in the mirror, you're dead.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.220
It doesn't look like a dick.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.965
Get off my ass, man!

20:56.088 --> 20:57.649
You might wanna
listen to this.

20:59.525 --> 21:02.597
- It's a fucking piece of shit.
- Fuck you.

21:03.229 --> 21:06.403
'Cause all the company she
keeps is rubbing off on her.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.273
All the fucking
piece-of-shit-ness...

21:08.367 --> 21:10.438
Man, you need a Xanax or something.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.777
Why don't you go home
and fuck your mama again?

21:14.073 --> 21:15.074
Come on, man.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.781
You were slightly amusing in the field.
Here, you just suck.

21:18.410 --> 21:20.617
I will out-fight,
out-fuck

21:20.713 --> 21:22.624
and out-work you
on my worst day.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.089
See, I don't
wanna fuck you, Lizzy.

21:24.150 --> 21:25.720
Crack whores are not my thing.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.287
Hey! That's my wife, yeah?

21:28.387 --> 21:31.834
Bro, you bought a fucking cow
when the milk was free.

21:31.924 --> 21:34.996
Let's do ii, pussy.
Come on, let's go bareback.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.301
Wear a mouthpiece and
head guard if you want.

21:37.396 --> 21:39.933
I'll still fucking
dismantle you!

21:41.267 --> 21:42.837
Okay, now I want to fuck her.

21:46.405 --> 21:48.476
Out cold, bitch!

21:49.475 --> 21:51.352
- She got you.
- Yo!

21:53.179 --> 21:55.090
What the fuck is going on here?

22:00.152 --> 22:02.257
This place looks like
a fucking crack house!

22:02.588 --> 22:05.762
You shouldn't be here.
What are you doing here?

22:05.925 --> 22:08.098
The investigation is over.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.969
- We're back in business!
- No shit?

22:10.462 --> 22:12.032
Yes!
Whoa!

22:12.097 --> 22:13.599
Here are your credentials.
Fucking finally!

22:13.666 --> 22:15.270
Whoa! Gimme!

22:15.367 --> 22:17.506
- How'd you manage this, boss?
- Ain't that pretty?

22:18.671 --> 22:21.174
I told you!
Hold you motherfuckers!

22:21.273 --> 22:22.809
- And you, put a shirt on.
- Here we go.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.377
You're just jealous.

22:24.476 --> 22:25.853
Good to
have you back, boss.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.117
Is that a dick?

22:27.213 --> 22:29.056
Dude!

22:29.148 --> 22:31.526
It's a self-portrait!
Where's the fucking mirror?

22:32.218 --> 22:33.219
It's not done.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.298
Let's go!

22:38.390 --> 22:39.528
Morning, boss.

22:43.229 --> 22:44.799
Morning!
Boss!

22:45.898 --> 22:47.309
Morning, Daddy.

22:47.633 --> 22:48.633
Good to be back.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.544
What took you so fucking long?

22:50.636 --> 22:52.377
I'm embarrassed
you don't have decent shit.

22:52.471 --> 22:53.575
Who's got coffee?

22:53.672 --> 22:55.413
Knock the dust off!

23:03.983 --> 23:06.327
Are you fucking kidding me?

23:06.752 --> 23:09.596
You promised you'd use the
down time to work on yourself.

23:10.689 --> 23:12.168
I'm fine.

23:16.195 --> 23:17.435
Give me the weapon.

23:17.529 --> 23:18.599
No.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.732
I can train...
Lizzy.

23:19.832 --> 23:22.073
Breacher.
I'm training.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.843
Why don't you go play daddy
somewhere else, huh?

23:32.678 --> 23:34.385
Come on.

23:34.513 --> 23:35.924
Slow the fuck down!

23:36.015 --> 23:37.221
Shut the fuck up!

23:37.349 --> 23:39.886
- Hurry the fuck up!
- You're moving too fast.

23:40.019 --> 23:41.259
- Sweetheart, shut up!
- So slow.

23:41.353 --> 23:43.128
You need to skinny up,
motherfucker.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.701
Get that chicken
wing out of the way.

23:44.790 --> 23:45.962
Fucking get in your own lane.

23:46.058 --> 23:48.436
Y'all seriously
taking giant-ass steps.

23:48.527 --> 23:50.131
Give me room.
Give me room!

23:50.796 --> 23:52.366
Little room.
Little room!

23:52.798 --> 23:53.936
Contact right!

23:55.968 --> 23:57.038
Hi! We're home!

23:58.137 --> 23:59.138
Thank you!

23:59.238 --> 24:00.546
Fuck, y'all didn't
even stutter, man!

24:00.606 --> 24:01.778
Slowest fucking pie
I've ever seen in my life.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.148
Whenever you're ready!

24:03.242 --> 24:04.812
Come on,
open the door, let's go!

24:04.910 --> 24:06.412
Make a decision!

24:06.545 --> 24:09.219
All fucking day.
Let me pie this fucking door.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.361
If there's pussy in there,
you'd already be in there.

24:11.784 --> 24:12.785
Dead.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.125
It won't kick itself.
Punch it!

24:14.219 --> 24:15.721
Breaching
the fucking door!

24:18.490 --> 24:19.491
What the fuck
are you doing?

24:19.591 --> 24:20.968
Seriously!
Fuck you!

24:21.060 --> 24:23.006
First in the room? That's the
way to wait for the team there.

24:23.095 --> 24:24.836
Very nice. Very nice. That's
not how you fucking do it.

24:24.930 --> 24:26.910
You going to get in
my fucking way every time?

24:26.966 --> 24:29.412
All right, secure from exercise!

24:31.337 --> 24:32.441
This one is down.

24:32.571 --> 24:33.675
Yeah, I got him.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.585
What about him?
Fuck!

24:39.645 --> 24:41.955
And who is that? Somebody's
got to dig that fucking corner.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.084
No shit!

24:43.115 --> 24:44.753
- Yeah, second guy in the room.
- It was you!

24:44.850 --> 24:46.090
I was number three!
You got this guy.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.290
- That's your fucking corner!
- Be quiet.

24:47.419 --> 24:48.420
- I
- was third one through!

24:48.487 --> 24:49.522
Guys, shut up!

24:49.655 --> 24:51.328
- You should have dug the corner.
- Shut up!

24:51.423 --> 24:53.596
Shut up. Grinder.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.171
You have to take that corner.

24:55.427 --> 24:56.667
You breached.

24:56.762 --> 24:59.038
You immediately turn
and you go for it.

24:59.131 --> 25:01.873
That's your responsibility,
and you cover that corner.

25:01.967 --> 25:03.674
There's no argument here,
so let's run it again.

25:03.769 --> 25:05.214
- Fucking asshole.
- Told you.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.442
Come on, guys.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.480
Fuck it! Why don't
I run it by myself?

25:11.543 --> 25:13.113
I'll show you
fuckers how to do it!

25:13.178 --> 25:14.384
Oh, fuck off!

25:18.650 --> 25:21.563
So what happened? You
used to be good at this.

25:22.388 --> 25:25.460
Yeah, well, six months of finger
pointing and recrimination happened.

25:26.291 --> 25:28.134
You weren't around.
You didn't have our backs.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.138
Well, not by choice.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.731
That's your fucking excuse?

25:31.997 --> 25:34.136
When did you ever
listen to the rules?

25:40.305 --> 25:41.978
We're not a team anymore.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.984
Just a gang.

25:48.313 --> 25:51.817
And there is no trust.
There is no trust.

25:56.488 --> 25:59.662
We're going to
get it back. I know.

26:00.826 --> 26:02.703
We're still a family.

26:03.662 --> 26:05.733
Yeah, l wish
I could believe you.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.675
So now we
don't trust each other?

26:16.008 --> 26:18.284
In what we do,
there is only trust.

26:19.378 --> 26:20.516
I trust you!

26:22.381 --> 26:24.691
Each and every one of you.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.959
With my life.

26:29.855 --> 26:33.359
And I'll prove it to you.
Kick the door.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.572
Kill the bad guys.
Don't kill me.

26:42.634 --> 26:44.875
What the fuck
did you say to him?

27:04.223 --> 27:05.293
Target!

27:22.741 --> 27:23.776
How did we do, boss?

27:25.244 --> 27:26.951
Good. Good job.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.285
I guess we don't suck.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.084
It's time to do the Lord's work.

27:42.794 --> 27:44.967
Shots! Beers! Come on!

27:45.097 --> 27:46.371
All right,
who's gonna get this round?

27:49.535 --> 27:51.037
I'll get the fucking round!

27:51.937 --> 27:53.644
Why they call you Pyro, honey?

27:53.772 --> 27:56.013
'Cause I hooked a flashbang
in a meth lab,

27:56.108 --> 27:58.179
burned down the whole
fucking apartment building.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.289
That's why we don't let
him have the bangs no more.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.326
You about burned my
<i>ass</i> up, you bastard.

28:03.382 --> 28:06.022
<i>We ca“ mm Pym
'cause ms ass bums.</i>

28:10.622 --> 28:11.965
Yeah, whatever, asshole.

28:12.057 --> 28:13.418
Get of here.
Get out of here.

28:13.458 --> 28:15.301
I would hit that.
Fuck yeah!

28:15.360 --> 28:17.670
To Lizzy,
my favorite evil bitch.

28:17.729 --> 28:19.709
Evil bitch!

28:19.798 --> 28:20.833
No, fuck that!

28:22.134 --> 28:23.511
Let's drink to Smoke Jennings.

28:25.137 --> 28:27.048
That motherfucker
died for our sins.

28:27.339 --> 28:28.374
Fuck yeah.

28:28.473 --> 28:29.508
Smoke Jennings!
Smoke!

28:29.575 --> 28:30.713
Smoke!
Smoke!

28:30.809 --> 28:31.913
Yeah!
Smoke!

28:32.311 --> 28:34.086
This is one for the
homie that can't be here.

28:34.179 --> 28:35.180
Smoke Jennings.

28:47.759 --> 28:49.432
You know, we missed you.

28:51.663 --> 28:53.939
You're the heart and soul of us.

28:54.533 --> 28:56.342
Don't ever forget that

28:58.203 --> 28:59.944
They almost won.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.411
It's fucking bullshit
and you know it.

29:04.843 --> 29:06.516
We're here, aren't we?

29:08.180 --> 29:10.956
We held out

29:11.049 --> 29:12.858
as a team.

29:16.788 --> 29:20.634
It's just that,
that thing that we did

29:20.726 --> 29:22.034
was for nothing.

29:27.032 --> 29:29.603
Let it go.

29:29.701 --> 29:31.374
You hear me?

29:32.371 --> 29:33.975
Let it go.

29:34.373 --> 29:35.716
<i>Okay. -</i>

29:40.712 --> 29:43.784
You know what? I can do this
shit better than all y'all.

29:46.652 --> 29:48.063
Get the
fuck off the stage!

29:48.220 --> 29:50.427
Get the fuck off the stage!

29:50.555 --> 29:51.829
Relax!

29:51.923 --> 29:53.561
Let's go, motherfucker!

29:53.659 --> 29:55.070
Get the fuck back!

29:58.230 --> 29:59.436
Good night,
motherfucker'

29:59.564 --> 30:02.568
All right, let's go. We
gotta roll, we gotta roll!

30:02.734 --> 30:04.407
Whoo!

30:04.503 --> 30:05.903
Sorry about
your bouncer, man!

30:05.904 --> 30:06.939
Thanks for the lap dance!

30:07.072 --> 30:09.348
Have a nice night! Son
of a bitch with a weak-ass right.

31:03.462 --> 31:04.463
Fuck!

31:09.868 --> 31:11.643
What the fuck?

31:14.840 --> 31:15.910
What the fuck?

31:16.641 --> 31:19.247
No! What the fuck?

31:20.011 --> 31:22.992
Fuck! Fuck!

32:33.985 --> 32:35.157
Miss.

32:35.253 --> 32:36.391
Hi.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.428
Tom worked for me.

32:42.994 --> 32:44.098
John Wharton.

32:44.162 --> 32:46.836
Caroline Brentwood.
Homicide.

32:46.932 --> 32:48.741
Can you help me
with next of kin?

32:48.800 --> 32:50.677
There's some ex-wives.

32:53.004 --> 32:54.950
So, what happened here?

32:55.006 --> 32:57.247
Train versus Winnebago.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.652
Train won.

32:58.743 --> 33:00.279
So why is Homicide involved?

33:00.345 --> 33:03.815
Well, some sucker's got to write it up.
Guess that's me.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.099
Anything else I can do?

33:11.690 --> 33:13.328
Start sweeping for body parts.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.764
Caroline, hey,
I found the torso.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.603
Coming to you!

33:25.837 --> 33:27.510
Oh, geez.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.285
Look at this.

33:31.142 --> 33:33.122
You can smell
the alcohol from here.

33:33.612 --> 33:35.455
Yeah, right.

33:43.488 --> 33:45.490
Your man's been drinking.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.670
We did have a team celebration.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.670
As soon as I get
this place locked down,

33:51.196 --> 33:53.005
I need a statement from you.

33:59.404 --> 34:01.543
You know who that is, right?

34:01.640 --> 34:04.985
Some Fed who thinks
his shit don't stink.

34:05.310 --> 34:06.812
That's John Wharton.

34:08.179 --> 34:10.250
He's a drug war god.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.659
What... He looks
a little down, Darius.

34:14.719 --> 34:16.665
Why don't you go suck his dick?

34:17.489 --> 34:18.934
That ain't right.

34:18.989 --> 34:21.766
Well, you're making cow eyes at him.
That ain't right.

34:49.387 --> 34:52.732
Whoo!
Ooh, yeah!

34:53.291 --> 34:55.703
Aren't you a little
old for this shit?

34:55.760 --> 34:57.398
Investigator Caroline Brentwood.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.305
I'm looking for Eddie Jordan.

35:04.402 --> 35:05.938
Neck!
Yo!

35:06.037 --> 35:07.277
I brought you a present

35:07.372 --> 35:08.373
Oh, shit.

35:10.575 --> 35:11.576
Look at the water.

35:15.046 --> 35:16.081
No, thank you.

35:16.147 --> 35:18.957
Have a fucking drink for my friend.
We buried him today.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.929
That's why I'm here. You
wanna go somewhere private?

35:21.987 --> 35:23.933
Private?

35:23.989 --> 35:26.299
Fuck that.
This is family time.

35:26.391 --> 35:28.234
You just get the fuck over here

35:28.326 --> 35:30.897
and make it clap for Uncle Daddy.

35:31.096 --> 35:33.804
Look at you,
got the whole FBI getup.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.144
You got your badge.

35:36.234 --> 35:39.977
You dumb fuck,
that's the lead investigator

35:40.071 --> 35:41.778
in Pyro's accident.
Am I right?

35:41.840 --> 35:43.251
It's a fucking stripper!

35:43.308 --> 35:44.810
She's not
the stripper.

35:44.909 --> 35:46.354
She's an APD investigator.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.151
Damn.
We'd welcome you.

35:48.246 --> 35:50.726
But I just want to know what the
fuck you doing here right now.

35:50.749 --> 35:52.786
Well, I'm sorry to
rain on your bro down.

35:52.917 --> 35:54.954
I just need to get
a quick statement.

35:55.020 --> 35:58.194
Neck, lawyer the fuck up!
Don't say shit!

35:58.289 --> 35:59.290
You know it, Sugar!

35:59.357 --> 36:01.928
Neck hates cops
because the Columbian police

36:01.993 --> 36:04.337
beat the living shit out of
him for not paying a tranny.

36:04.429 --> 36:07.808
Dude, you fucking gotta bring
that up every fucking time!

36:07.866 --> 36:09.971
I got worse PTSD
from a dude in heels

36:10.101 --> 36:12.172
than anything I got
in that fucking place.

36:12.270 --> 36:14.216
I'll strip
for you, honey bear.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.120
Get her, Grinder.

36:19.144 --> 36:20.521
I'm good, thank you.

36:20.612 --> 36:24.287
Pull your fucking panties out of your
<i>ass,</i> sweetheart, and take the beer.

36:24.349 --> 36:26.226
It's a party.

36:26.351 --> 36:28.627
Well, since you
put it like that.

36:35.293 --> 36:37.534
I like the way you play.
Now lick it off.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.472
One step closer, I rip
your fucking balls off.

36:39.564 --> 36:41.407
Get her, baby bird!
Get her!

36:41.833 --> 36:42.971
Hey! Shut the fuck up!

36:43.068 --> 36:44.138
Boss, come on!

36:44.202 --> 36:46.079
Come on, settle down, shut up.

36:46.171 --> 36:49.516
This is my fucking house,
okay? She's a guest!

36:50.642 --> 36:52.815
Guest, my ass.
Come on. Let's go inside.

36:52.877 --> 36:55.050
Hit that, Breach, get some!

36:55.146 --> 36:57.092
Investigate
the shit out of that.

36:57.182 --> 36:58.490
Whose round it is?

36:58.550 --> 37:00.223
Pyro's!

37:02.087 --> 37:06.001
I've been chasing your man three
days for a five-minute interview.

37:06.057 --> 37:07.502
Can you do something about that?

37:12.697 --> 37:13.937
You some kind of a big deal?

37:14.332 --> 37:15.834
Yeah. I've been around.

37:16.501 --> 37:19.505
I speak to him tomorrow,
or I go over your head.

37:20.839 --> 37:22.716
I will make it happen.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.451
Your friend's here.

37:29.047 --> 37:32.517
I wouldn't bother.
Tips are lousy.

37:34.285 --> 37:36.595
Liquor store's
cleared by arrest.

37:37.188 --> 37:39.361
- We present to Nichols on Tuesday.
- No.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.235
Suspect has taken a plea.

37:41.359 --> 37:42.861
Who says?
Nichols' office.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.471
Funny how they do that when
they're on video. Mmm-hmm.

37:46.698 --> 37:50.373
Train versus RV.
It's ruled accidental,

37:50.468 --> 37:52.880
so I'm thinking this
is not our problem.

37:52.937 --> 37:55.941
I just have one interview to do on that.
I'll knock it out tonight.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.077
It's accidental.
Who cares?

37:58.910 --> 38:02.050
Right, so no one should interview
the last guy who saw him alive'?

38:02.547 --> 38:04.049
Perfectionist.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.389
Breacher. Gotta go.

38:10.755 --> 38:11.893
Breacher. Damn.

38:12.557 --> 38:14.093
He's sexting me.

38:15.126 --> 38:17.470
All right, man, just go.
Go ahead. Want to see?

38:17.796 --> 38:18.900
Get out of my face
with that, man.

38:19.063 --> 38:20.133
He's a natural blond, you know.

38:20.231 --> 38:21.676
Get out of my face.
Oh, yeah.

38:21.766 --> 38:24.144
I don't want to hear
nothing about that.

38:24.736 --> 38:26.238
You are dirty.

38:26.304 --> 38:27.510
Jezebel.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.681
I've known
some cops in my time,

38:32.243 --> 38:34.780
but your people
don't seem like cops.

38:34.846 --> 38:35.984
Good.

38:36.414 --> 38:38.758
They're the best undercover
agents in the DEA.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.821
Work hard, play hard, right?

38:43.488 --> 38:45.195
Look who's talking.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.098
You enjoy your cups-

38:47.926 --> 38:49.667
Why do you say that?

38:49.761 --> 38:50.831
Your skin.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.168
Wow.

38:55.300 --> 38:56.506
Just.“

38:56.601 --> 38:58.012
Wow.

39:03.441 --> 39:04.647
Wow.

39:10.515 --> 39:11.619
Neck!

39:12.350 --> 39:13.624
It's me!

39:17.655 --> 39:19.293
Shit, no light.

39:19.824 --> 39:21.132
Come on.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.001
You don't need that

39:27.065 --> 39:28.567
I'm a cautious girl.

39:29.467 --> 39:30.571
Neck!

39:31.369 --> 39:33.315
Wake up, you drunk fuck!

39:42.981 --> 39:45.052
You got right. Move.

39:48.653 --> 39:49.825
Clear.

39:50.922 --> 39:52.094
Clear.

40:01.733 --> 40:02.905
Sorry.

40:07.872 --> 40:09.545
Let me clear this.

40:12.176 --> 40:13.246
Move.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.519
- Clear.
- Okay.

40:30.194 --> 40:31.867
Where the fuck is he?

40:34.632 --> 40:35.633
Oh, fuck!

40:46.778 --> 40:48.883
Would you help me up, please?

40:48.947 --> 40:50.483
Can you help me up, please?

40:57.121 --> 40:59.226
Thank you very much.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.233
Well, we found him.

41:17.575 --> 41:18.918
You smoke?

41:19.811 --> 41:22.985
Only when I find my witnesses
nailed to the ceiling.

41:23.448 --> 41:25.359
Right. I'm gonna leave.

41:25.450 --> 41:27.930
No, you're not.
You're not fucking leaving!

41:27.986 --> 41:29.488
You're in this now.

41:29.587 --> 41:31.260
What are you talking about?

41:31.522 --> 41:32.865
I'm a Fed.

41:33.591 --> 41:34.797
See you.

41:37.795 --> 41:39.468
You're an asshole.

41:48.139 --> 41:50.449
All right,
let's cut him down.

41:50.641 --> 41:54.282
From a preliminary investigation,
I have a cause of death.

41:54.612 --> 41:55.852
Massive hemothorax.

41:56.614 --> 41:58.685
From a right ventricular
stab wound.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.054
This, where my finger is...
Uh-huh.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.324
That's how far the knife
went inside his chest.

42:03.654 --> 42:06.294
Okay. And
they gutted him like a pig.

42:07.825 --> 42:09.805
Hey, Doc,
this guy's a trained guy.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.621
Who could walk up on
a trained guy like that?

42:11.863 --> 42:13.809
Somebody that had
better skills than he had.

42:14.132 --> 42:16.408
He knew exactly
where he was stabbing.

42:16.634 --> 42:19.240
Boo-yah! Got some hairs.
Not the victim's.

42:19.337 --> 42:21.146
Show me.
Right here.

42:21.672 --> 42:22.844
And here's some more. Here.

42:23.207 --> 42:24.550
Can you bag those?
Sure.

42:24.642 --> 42:26.986
I'll take them
to the lab myself.

42:27.045 --> 42:28.080
<i>Okay. -</i>

42:28.713 --> 42:30.659
- Thanks, guys.
- Sure.

42:30.715 --> 42:32.490
- Thanks.
- You got it.

42:36.020 --> 42:40.560
You know, in Northern Ireland, the IRA
nailed snitches to the kitchen floor.

42:40.658 --> 42:42.001
How do you know shit like that?

42:42.093 --> 42:43.436
Some research I was doing.

42:43.895 --> 42:47.001
Okay, so you put out a BOLO for
Lucky Charms guy.

42:47.065 --> 42:50.842
Hey, take a criminalist
and sweep the RV's cab.

42:51.235 --> 42:52.578
For what?
What am I looking for?

42:53.037 --> 42:54.209
Linkage.

43:04.515 --> 43:06.517
They're dead and we're not.
What are we doing?

43:06.684 --> 43:09.130
We D-up and
present a hard target.

43:09.520 --> 43:12.592
Like taking showers
with full body armor.

43:13.091 --> 43:15.196
Well, we need fucking intel.

43:15.526 --> 43:17.767
Who'd they send up? Well, who
do you think, sweetheart?

43:17.862 --> 43:18.932
Check the board!

43:19.030 --> 43:21.237
Could be Soto!
Could be fucking Romero!

43:21.365 --> 43:22.537
It could be fucking...
They could be...

43:22.600 --> 43:23.908
They may be... Fucking...

43:23.968 --> 43:26.039
Any of this a surprise to you?

43:27.105 --> 43:28.743
Just let it go, huh?

43:28.806 --> 43:29.910
Surprise to you, Sugar?

43:29.974 --> 43:31.976
I don't really know
what you're talking about.

43:33.311 --> 43:36.485
Guess I'm the only one
with any fucking balls here.

43:38.149 --> 43:40.060
It's the goddamn money.

43:41.586 --> 43:43.896
Just let it
go, all right? No!

43:44.989 --> 43:46.969
We had to go fingering
the devil's pussy.

43:47.225 --> 43:50.434
It's an occupational hazard
when you fight the cartels.

43:50.561 --> 43:51.835
Oh, really?

43:51.929 --> 43:53.806
You see any other
Feds getting smoked?

43:53.898 --> 43:56.105
It could happen to anyone.
Bullshit!

43:56.968 --> 43:58.948
You believe that, chief?

43:59.070 --> 44:02.313
Or is that just some shit you're
spitting in case this place is bugged?

44:03.174 --> 44:06.417
Always assume that
someone is listening.

44:08.479 --> 44:11.289
So shut the fuck up.

44:15.486 --> 44:17.193
I ain't gonna fight you, boss.

45:34.432 --> 45:35.604
Where the fuck are you going?

45:38.202 --> 45:39.579
Out.

45:40.705 --> 45:42.048
I'm bored.

45:42.273 --> 45:43.547
You're not going out.

45:43.608 --> 45:45.212
It's not safe.

45:46.377 --> 45:47.412
They're hunting us.

45:47.778 --> 45:49.849
I can take care of myself.

45:50.348 --> 45:51.429
Give me that fucking... No!

45:51.515 --> 45:54.758
Give that back to me. Give
that back to me! Monster!

45:55.620 --> 45:56.928
What's this, huh?

45:57.188 --> 45:58.258
Is this chewing gum?

45:58.356 --> 45:59.562
Huh?
Yeah.

46:00.024 --> 46:01.935
What the fuck you need this for?

46:02.026 --> 46:03.937
What the fuck do
you need this for?

46:05.096 --> 46:06.734
Get out of my way.
No, Lizzy.

46:16.307 --> 46:17.411
It's the stripper.

46:17.942 --> 46:19.114
Can we talk inside?

46:19.243 --> 46:20.523
What the fuck
do you want?

46:21.612 --> 46:24.491
Just some background
information on your unit.

46:24.815 --> 46:27.125
So I can develop some suspects.

46:32.423 --> 46:33.663
You know what we do, right?

46:34.292 --> 46:37.501
This special operations team?

46:37.895 --> 46:39.306
Well, to be honest,
I have no idea.

46:39.397 --> 46:40.774
Why don't you tell me?

46:41.599 --> 46:42.771
We covertly

46:44.235 --> 46:45.407
penetrate

46:46.804 --> 46:48.442
drug organizations.

46:49.407 --> 46:51.683
I guess that would make
you some enemies, huh?

46:52.143 --> 46:53.850
Any one come to mind?

46:53.944 --> 46:55.287
Any particular guy

46:55.346 --> 46:58.919
that might nail Special Agent
Jordan to a ceiling?

46:59.684 --> 47:01.493
Are you really this stupid?

47:01.585 --> 47:03.326
Ma'am, I'm not your friend,

47:03.421 --> 47:04.764
and I'm not your colleague.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.495
So don't bully me.

47:06.590 --> 47:07.590
Or I'll slap you

47:07.625 --> 47:08.763
with a 48-hour jail hold.

47:08.826 --> 47:09.907
And by the looks of things,

47:09.960 --> 47:12.338
you can't hack a day without your
favorite controlled substance.

47:12.430 --> 47:13.966
So let's keep it nice, shall we?

47:14.031 --> 47:15.942
And yes' assume I'm stupid.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.941
Paint me a picture.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.042
Please.

47:28.045 --> 47:29.991
I took these in Juarez.

47:30.681 --> 47:32.490
They're friends of mine.

47:32.550 --> 47:34.723
And this is what
the Rios-Garza cartel does

47:34.852 --> 47:37.059
to indicate that
you've pissed them off.

47:40.124 --> 47:43.298
Sweetheart, you're so in
over your fucking head.

47:43.894 --> 47:46.898
You need more than a Glock
and sensible shoes.

47:47.465 --> 47:48.808
Walk away.

47:49.734 --> 47:51.077
Walk away.

47:56.807 --> 47:59.253
I'll show myself out.
Thank you for your time.

47:59.343 --> 48:01.016
It's our pleasure.

48:02.313 --> 48:03.815
We're gonna
have to each get two jobs

48:03.981 --> 48:05.392
just to put him through school.

48:05.483 --> 48:07.163
Have you
considered prostitution?

48:07.218 --> 48:09.357
Hey, what's up?
More black hairs.

48:09.987 --> 48:11.227
And look.

48:11.322 --> 48:14.030
A beautiful thumbprint we got off
the steering column of the RV.

48:14.091 --> 48:16.571
It's not the vic's.
Boo-yeah! Linkage.

48:17.361 --> 48:18.704
You just said
"boo-yeah."

48:19.430 --> 48:22.172
That's my thing.
Don't jack my thing.

48:24.502 --> 48:26.846
I heard the lab tech
say it.

48:27.505 --> 48:28.745
I didn't hear it.

48:28.873 --> 48:30.113
Bullshit, you heard it.

48:30.207 --> 48:31.880
Well, if she said it,
she got it from me.

48:34.779 --> 48:37.453
Due to the staging of Special
Agent Jordan's body,

48:37.548 --> 48:40.188
we believe there's a connection
to the Rios-Garza cartel.

48:40.518 --> 48:43.727
DTO. Rios-Garza Drug
Trafficking Organization.

48:43.788 --> 48:45.790
We don't use
the term "cartel."

48:47.124 --> 48:48.194
Thank you, sir.

48:48.259 --> 48:49.761
It seems that Special Agent
Roberts' death

48:49.860 --> 48:50.930
was not an accident.

48:51.028 --> 48:53.770
We have recovered physical evidence
linking the two crime scenes.

48:53.864 --> 48:55.366
I would like to have
a copy of those files,

48:55.533 --> 48:57.035
if you could make
those available for me.

48:57.067 --> 48:59.741
Yes' sir. Today, would
that be all right?

48:59.804 --> 49:01.784
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

49:01.872 --> 49:04.113
Investigator Brentwood, what
exactly do you want from us?

49:04.608 --> 49:07.054
Well, learning about the victims
helps me find the suspects.

49:07.578 --> 49:10.957
Maybe these murders are blowback
from cases they worked on.

49:11.048 --> 49:13.255
You want access
to DEA case files?

49:13.551 --> 49:14.621
It would help.

49:14.718 --> 49:17.597
Are you asking for investigatory
support or access to our records?

49:17.655 --> 49:18.656
Both.

49:18.756 --> 49:19.796
Look' maybe there's someone

49:19.824 --> 49:20.894
I can liaise with,
someone who...

49:20.958 --> 49:21.959
Investigator Brentwood,

49:22.059 --> 49:24.733
your agency needs to draft a formal
letter requesting assistance.

49:24.795 --> 49:28.004
Any documents you want access to
will need to be specifically cited.

49:28.098 --> 49:30.078
Specifically cited. What
information do you need?

49:30.134 --> 49:32.910
Incident report numbers.
File numbers.

49:32.970 --> 49:33.971
Right.

49:34.071 --> 49:35.277
And how are we going
to know those numbers

49:35.406 --> 49:37.249
if we don't know those numbers?

49:37.308 --> 49:38.828
If you don't know
really what you want,

49:38.909 --> 49:41.116
what are you doing here?

49:41.245 --> 49:43.418
Two murders of DEA agents

49:43.481 --> 49:45.085
have happened on my watch.

49:45.149 --> 49:46.856
And it's my job to
investigate them,

49:46.951 --> 49:48.589
and I'm asking for your help.

49:48.953 --> 49:51.661
Just have the chief fire off a letter,
and we'll see what we can do.

49:52.823 --> 49:54.803
Thank you for coming in.

49:55.593 --> 49:56.936
Have a nice day, y'all.

49:57.294 --> 50:00.434
Fucking US Attorney
and their own general counsel?

50:00.498 --> 50:01.602
These guys are scared.

50:01.665 --> 50:03.838
Hey. You're Brentwood,
you're Jackson, right?

50:03.934 --> 50:04.935
Yeah.

50:05.002 --> 50:06.722
You working the agent
nailed to the ceiling?

50:06.770 --> 50:08.215
What do you know about that?

50:08.305 --> 50:10.342
The DEA is a dysfunctional
family, all right?

50:10.441 --> 50:12.352
No one's going to talk
family business with you.

50:12.443 --> 50:13.513
Who are you?
Got a card?

50:13.644 --> 50:14.765
Ask yourself why it happened.

50:14.778 --> 50:17.987
Everything happens for a reason.
Think about that.

50:23.120 --> 50:25.464
Stop leaving your
shit on my seat.

50:25.656 --> 50:26.828
That's not mine.

50:26.957 --> 50:29.301
It's not some porn you're
hiding from your wife?

50:30.794 --> 50:31.864
That's not mine.

50:31.996 --> 50:33.134
It's not mine.

50:33.631 --> 50:36.077
<i>You're out here saving
these adrenaline junkies</i>

50:36.166 --> 50:39.045
<i>that mean absolutely nothing
to this department.</i>

50:39.236 --> 50:40.806
<i>I would take
a bullet for those guys.</i>

50:40.971 --> 50:42.177
<i>Hmm. You'd take a bullet.</i>

50:42.239 --> 50:43.377
<i>Would you take 10 million bucks?</i>

50:43.474 --> 50:45.351
<i>Would you take $10 million?</i>

50:45.543 --> 50:46.749
<i>Where's the money?</i>

50:46.877 --> 50:48.083
<i>Don't fucking scream at me!</i>

50:48.178 --> 50:50.249
<i>Where's the money?
You dumb fuck, you!</i>

50:50.481 --> 50:51.482
<i>Look at you!</i>

50:51.549 --> 50:53.358
<i>With your fucking 48% body fat.</i>

50:53.417 --> 50:55.829
<i>And, you, scrawny lime bastard!</i>

50:55.920 --> 50:57.831
<i>- Fuck you guys!
- Go to the gym, John.</i>

50:58.689 --> 51:01.397
Fucking liar.
Fucking liar!

51:01.492 --> 51:02.937
He's a fucking liar.

51:03.027 --> 51:06.008
What? Caroline,
where you going?

51:11.001 --> 51:12.503
Why the fuck didn't you tell me

51:12.570 --> 51:16.780
you were under investigation for
stealing from the Rios-Garza cartel?

51:16.874 --> 51:18.046
Get in.

51:18.342 --> 51:19.685
I need a drink.

51:41.031 --> 51:42.601
I need you to be
straight with me, John.

51:42.900 --> 51:44.436
No, you be straight with me.

51:44.635 --> 51:46.546
Why do I have to find out
through the grapevine

51:46.604 --> 51:48.165
that you linked
the deaths of my people?

51:48.238 --> 51:49.911
They're linked,
I'm sorry. My turn.

51:49.974 --> 51:51.282
Did you steal the money?

51:51.375 --> 51:52.820
No.

51:52.910 --> 51:54.890
And fuck you for asking.
Don't be such a girl.

51:54.945 --> 51:58.415
Your agency thinks you did.
So does the Rios-Garza cartel.

51:58.482 --> 52:00.325
Why do you think
they're killing your guys?

52:00.651 --> 52:03.598
Spend enough time on the
job, the job bites back.

52:03.721 --> 52:05.291
That's bullshit.

52:07.257 --> 52:09.066
You going somewhere?

52:09.960 --> 52:12.497
One of my guys quit the team.
He's off the grid.

52:12.896 --> 52:14.398
I gotta warn him.

52:14.798 --> 52:17.404
Okay, grab your stuff
and I'll drive.

52:20.938 --> 52:23.248
<i>They're going to continue
to fucking kill people,</i>

52:23.307 --> 52:24.980
<i>and kill fucking innocent people</i>

52:25.075 --> 52:27.612
<i>and women and children in
Mexico and the United States</i>

52:27.745 --> 52:29.418
<i>- unless you have guys like me!
<i>- Son!</i></i>

52:29.513 --> 52:30.583
<i>That's a fact.
Son!</i>

52:30.914 --> 52:32.757
<i>Motherfucker, I quit.</i>

52:38.255 --> 52:41.168
Last fall, an 8-year-old girl
vanished from her bed.

52:41.258 --> 52:42.259
No leads.

52:42.326 --> 52:46.604
Only her daddy's bullshit
about hearing black voices.

52:48.432 --> 52:51.879
And he's a drinker. Joins AA
the week after she disappears.

52:52.603 --> 52:53.877
He profiles' too.

52:53.971 --> 52:55.848
Domestic abuser, all that.

52:56.140 --> 52:57.175
And I can't find enough

52:57.274 --> 52:58.275
for the DA to file.

52:58.542 --> 52:59.782
Do you see where this is going?

52:59.877 --> 53:02.790
Just because you're not in jail
doesn't mean you didn't do ii.

53:03.547 --> 53:04.747
You're awesome on a road trip,

53:04.782 --> 53:05.783
you know that?

53:05.849 --> 53:08.056
Yeah, I've heard that before.

53:23.133 --> 53:25.010
That's it,
right there.

53:31.809 --> 53:33.379
It's beautiful.

53:33.977 --> 53:35.479
Watch out for booby traps.

53:37.314 --> 53:38.588
Bullshit.

53:39.483 --> 53:40.928
I'm serious.

53:41.318 --> 53:43.821
This could take
your leg right off.

53:43.887 --> 53:45.662
Here's the trip wire.

53:50.094 --> 53:51.664
Why is he so paranoid?

53:52.162 --> 53:54.403
Maybe he doesn't want to
get nailed to a ceiling.

54:07.678 --> 54:08.952
Tripod!

54:15.953 --> 54:17.227
McNeely?

54:18.856 --> 54:20.199
It's John!

54:34.538 --> 54:35.949
There's something off.

56:11.869 --> 56:12.973
Fuck.

56:17.207 --> 56:18.709
Unit 2150.

56:20.010 --> 56:23.355
Send me two units
and an ME to my location.

56:52.843 --> 56:54.516
AK brass.

56:58.015 --> 56:59.961
The guy hit the trip wire.

57:01.018 --> 57:02.224
Right there.

57:10.861 --> 57:12.807
Looks like he bled out.

57:16.366 --> 57:18.141
Here, hold this.

57:26.209 --> 57:27.415
What's that?

57:27.544 --> 57:29.217
They' re world-class assholes.

57:31.548 --> 57:34.461
Give me the weapon.
I don't trust you.

57:34.551 --> 57:36.929
Well, you know, it was
getting heavy anyway.

57:51.501 --> 57:53.071
Hey!

57:54.171 --> 57:55.775
How you feeling?

57:57.407 --> 57:58.408
<i>I'm sorry</i>

57:58.775 --> 58:01.415
Well, now that you got
sucked into our world.

58:07.417 --> 58:08.760
They're Kaibiles.

58:08.852 --> 58:10.525
Kaibiles?

58:10.620 --> 58:12.463
Guatemalan Special Forces.

58:12.656 --> 58:13.794
<i>Okay. -</i>

58:13.924 --> 58:17.599
Rios-Garza Organization loves to
use them for high-power hits.

58:19.262 --> 58:23.938
You know, McNeely was
a fucking Navy SEAL.

58:25.602 --> 58:30.449
He was 10 times the
operator that I'll ever be.

58:33.877 --> 58:36.187
What chance do you think I got?

58:38.949 --> 58:41.953
See, they're the best
assassins that money can buy.

58:42.652 --> 58:45.064
Honey, I worked gangs
for eight years.

58:45.155 --> 58:46.532
Streets have rules, okay?

58:46.623 --> 58:48.193
You steal money, doesn't
matter who you are,

58:48.291 --> 58:50.328
you can be a cop,
you could be God,

58:51.294 --> 58:52.671
they will get you.

58:53.230 --> 58:55.506
I came here to help you.

58:55.565 --> 58:57.238
No, you did not.
To help you understand.

58:57.334 --> 58:58.870
You came here 'cause you
think you're gonna be next.

58:58.969 --> 59:01.210
You came here to steer me, okay?

59:01.304 --> 59:02.374
If you want to help me,

59:02.472 --> 59:04.213
and if you don't want to
get nailed to a ceiling

59:04.307 --> 59:06.344
or run over by a train,

59:06.410 --> 59:08.356
you need to break
free from your buddies

59:08.412 --> 59:11.723
and tell me something I don't
know about John Wharton.

59:11.815 --> 59:12.815
Because I can't read him.

59:12.849 --> 59:14.351
Tell me something I don't know.

59:20.857 --> 59:22.359
Two years ago,

59:22.826 --> 59:24.897
<i>we arrested
Edgar Rios in Juarez.</i>

59:25.662 --> 59:28.836
<i>He was an old-school drug lord,
ran all their operations.</i>

59:38.175 --> 59:39.848
<i>It was a big deal.</i>

59:54.057 --> 59:56.367
<i>We're handing him
over to the Mexicans</i>

59:58.395 --> 01:00:01.137
<i>when some broad pulls
her shit and dumps him.</i>

01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:08.211
<i>Cartel didn't want him
debriefed by our intel people.</i>

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:13.378
<i>Problem sowed.</i>

01:00:20.417 --> 01:00:22.294
<i>Bu! they had
a bigger problem.</i>

01:00:23.787 --> 01:00:28.258
<i>They wanted the man who can get
the man that nobody can get.</i>

01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:37.503
<i>John gets a call</i>

01:00:38.401 --> 01:00:39.744
<i>from the bad guys.</i>

01:00:42.005 --> 01:00:46.181
<i>They snatched his wife and kid right
out of his house on Lake Lanier.</i>

01:00:47.277 --> 01:00:49.314
<i>They're holding them in Juarez.</i>

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.591
<i>They make him an often.</i>

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:57.198
<i>"Surrender yourself to the
cartel and your family lives.</i>"

01:00:58.355 --> 01:00:59.993
<i>John's family is everything.</i>

01:01:00.924 --> 01:01:02.528
<i>John was married forever.</i>

01:01:04.094 --> 01:01:06.870
<i>His son Jacob was
his best friend.</i>

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:08.271
Love you, Dad.

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:14.506
<i>They tortured Karen
and Jacob to death.</i>

01:01:14.604 --> 01:01:16.982
<i>There's video.
Evil shit.</i>

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.542
<i>No! No! No!</i>

01:01:18.642 --> 01:01:23.148
<i>They mailed pieces of
them to his home for weeks.</i>

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.824
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:01:28.985 --> 01:01:32.797
<i>So John
went down there. Alone.</i>

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:36.861
<i>Hunting the man
who killed his wife.</i>

01:01:37.794 --> 01:01:39.467
John, we're coming in!

01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:51.916
<i>He didn't find him.</i>

01:01:54.144 --> 01:01:56.146
We're here to
bring you back home.

01:01:58.348 --> 01:02:00.885
This isn't going
to bring them back.

01:02:19.536 --> 01:02:21.209
Come on.
Let's go home.

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:26.715
<i>John is obsessed with
finding his wife's killer.</i>

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.456
<i>It's like a cancer in his soul.</i>

01:02:39.222 --> 01:02:42.692
Caroline, we lost John
when they died.

01:02:48.064 --> 01:02:49.134
Go home.

01:02:54.037 --> 01:02:55.380
Go home now.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:59.111
I was just trying to help.

01:03:10.887 --> 01:03:12.264
I'm sorry.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:15.097
I'm so sorry.

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:22.335
John.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.938
Wait up. I didn't know about your family.
John, I'm sorry, I...

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.441
Now you know.

01:03:31.741 --> 01:03:33.812
They sent me her face.

01:03:37.314 --> 01:03:38.691
I'm sorry.

01:03:42.285 --> 01:03:43.525
I'm sorry.

01:04:00.804 --> 01:04:02.841
So this isn't creepy.

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.946
Someone else get killed?

01:04:06.042 --> 01:04:08.318
I brought a peace offering.

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:21.860
Let me show you something.

01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:25.805
Your shooters. They're
Guatemalan Special Forces.

01:04:26.796 --> 01:04:29.538
They came in through
Juarez with stolen visas.

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:32.476
ICE alerted, ran surveillance.

01:04:32.669 --> 01:04:34.546
But lost them
outside of Atlanta.

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:36.207
Now, you said you had prints.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:39.844
Yeah. We got one
at the RV,

01:04:39.909 --> 01:04:41.718
and one outside McNeely's cabin.

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:43.757
But no NCIC hits.

01:04:44.347 --> 01:04:46.088
See if these match.

01:04:51.421 --> 01:04:53.162
Pretty please.

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:02.871
ICE took them off some beer
cans inside their hotel room.

01:05:05.168 --> 01:05:06.545
Should I have these?

01:05:07.003 --> 01:05:08.607
No.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.179
Then why'd you give them to me?

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:16.588
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

01:05:33.363 --> 01:05:34.865
Holy shit.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:40.714
No way.

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:44.608
Don't say a word.

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:45.879
<i>Mmm-mmm-mmm.</i>

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:48.115
What happened to
"I'll never date a cop"?

01:05:48.611 --> 01:05:50.955
Who said anything about a date?

01:05:51.247 --> 01:05:52.726
Evil harlot.

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:55.585
I can't believe you said that.

01:05:55.652 --> 01:05:57.097
You dirty, dirty girl.

01:05:58.288 --> 01:05:59.631
So I got a present for you.

01:06:00.223 --> 01:06:02.066
Check that out.

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:04.894
Oh!

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:07.135
Bad guys.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:09.471
Dude looks like Mario from Donkey Kong.
Mmm-hmm.

01:06:09.566 --> 01:06:11.842
Who's the metrosexual
with the... You've got...

01:06:12.168 --> 01:06:14.671
Prints, records, everything.

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.650
Did he leave it on
your night stand?

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:18.275
You don't want to know.

01:06:18.341 --> 01:06:19.445
Shit.

01:06:19.943 --> 01:06:22.856
Get in the car. You all right?
'Cause you walking funny.

01:06:22.946 --> 01:06:24.448
You're just jealous.

01:06:25.748 --> 01:06:28.319
Is he a big dude?

01:06:28.418 --> 01:06:30.659
Like, is he big?

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.158
That's inappropriate.

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:34.496
Was it good?
Shut up. Shut up.

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:35.751
Is he ripped,
like a six-pack?

01:06:35.758 --> 01:06:36.759
Shut up.

01:06:36.826 --> 01:06:39.363
Just wondering. 'Cause
he's, like, a legend.

01:06:39.496 --> 01:06:40.770
You're good to go.

01:06:40.864 --> 01:06:43.003
It's a match.

01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:47.309
Thank you' Tish. Okay, I'm going
to write out a warrant-affidavit.

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:49.646
You put out a BOLO,
armed and dangerous.

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:50.980
Yeah, and what you
gonna tell the judge?

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.316
That we got slipped some
Secret Squirrel ICE file?

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:54.715
That's exactly what
I'm going to tell him.

01:06:54.811 --> 01:06:57.314
Once they're in custody, we can get
as many print cards as we want.

01:06:57.380 --> 01:07:00.122
Doesn't matter how we get
there, as long as we get there.

01:07:01.284 --> 01:07:03.230
Do we know where they are?

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:05.692
Negative.

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:08.868
So we still got no target?

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.232
What the hell are
we doing sitting here?

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:14.001
We could be drinking beers, throwing
dollars at something naked.

01:07:14.063 --> 01:07:15.565
We're standing by.

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.572
For what?

01:07:17.667 --> 01:07:21.479
Apparently, the boss got that
investigator lady working for us now.

01:07:21.538 --> 01:07:22.915
Ain't that right, boss?

01:07:23.006 --> 01:07:24.041
Is that true?

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:29.317
Hey. Grab a vest.

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:30.551
What's up, partner?

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.854
That ICE file your boyfriend
gave you had a credit card.

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.428
I linked it to a cell phone.

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.555
That cell phone is live
in an apartment building.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:39.497
That apartment building,
Narco knows about it.

01:07:39.822 --> 01:07:41.824
It's a Rios-Garza
safe house.

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:44.235
Okay, enough
energy drinks, partner.

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:48.400
While you've been saving
mankind, I drafted an affidavit.

01:07:48.498 --> 01:07:51.104
I sent it to the clerk,
judge signed it.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.201
You'll be needing that

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:53.575
Okay. Yes, you're right.
I need that.

01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:54.944
You're right.
I'm sorry. I was excited.

01:07:55.071 --> 01:07:56.345
Try and arrest
him without it, huh'?

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:59.285
I got excited about it, but we
gotta go kick some doors, baby.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:22.938
Multi-level residential.
Four units.

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:25.876
Brick and masonry. Fortified
with barred windows.

01:08:25.969 --> 01:08:29.939
Steel security doors. You got an
iron fence around three sides.

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:32.211
All right,
what's the plan, boss?

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.549
We blue angel <i>up</i> the back.

01:08:33.876 --> 01:08:36.948
Single point dynamic entry.
Explosive breach.

01:08:37.046 --> 01:08:38.407
We don't know
what unit they're in,

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.728
so we clear the whole structure.

01:08:39.816 --> 01:08:42.626
All right, let's smoke these motherfuckers
and get us some dinner then.

01:08:43.051 --> 01:08:44.792
Two mikes out.

01:08:44.886 --> 01:08:46.457
Two out, copy.

01:08:46.555 --> 01:08:48.091
We're at the rail road tracks.

01:08:48.992 --> 01:08:50.095
Here we go, stand by.

01:08:50.225 --> 01:08:51.296
<i>Roger that.</i>

01:08:51.394 --> 01:08:53.965
We're not here to
make arrests, right?

01:09:14.017 --> 01:09:15.018
Breach!

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:25.036
They killed two federal agents already.
They're not fucking around!

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:27.867
No matter what, we all go home
tonight at the end of this mission.

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:36.779
You know what you're
doing with that thing?

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.680
I was in the Army.

01:09:38.774 --> 01:09:40.845
It's the wrong way up.
It's not the wrong way up.

01:09:40.943 --> 01:09:42.444
You got to rack it
all the way back.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:43.513
Come on.

01:09:43.613 --> 01:09:45.354
I know how to rack a gun.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.291
Heading right.

01:09:53.356 --> 01:09:55.396
Keep your hands up.
Let me see your hands.

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:57.299
Stay right there.

01:09:57.460 --> 01:09:58.620
Stay on the bed, kid.

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:00.397
Shitty closet!

01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:01.865
Clear!

01:10:01.964 --> 01:10:03.841
Clear!
Good! Let's go!

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.681
Ready to go!

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:09.239
Don't stop!

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:11.746
- Going left!
- Right!

01:10:12.575 --> 01:10:13.576
Got your back.

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:14.711
Got a bathroom! Clear!

01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:16.586
All clear!
Clear.

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.483
- We're all set, boss!
- Keep moving!

01:10:18.548 --> 01:10:20.084
Stay tight!

01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:28.825
- One on the couch!
- I got left.

01:10:28.891 --> 01:10:30.651
- Put your hands up!
- Going left, boss!

01:10:31.761 --> 01:10:33.399
Closet, clear!
Let me see your hands!

01:10:33.496 --> 01:10:34.770
Anyone else in here?

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:36.171
Coming around.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.007
Anyone else in here?
Just my kids.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.068
Kids in the back!

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.006
- There are kids.
- Door!

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.071
Stay right
where you are!

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:43.343
Just keep them up.

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:45.180
I got high.
Get low!

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:47.412
- Don't move.
- Clear.

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:49.387
Checking for mice.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:50.446
Clear!

01:10:50.546 --> 01:10:51.581
We're clear!

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:53.253
Moving.

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:55.054
Just stay on the bed.

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:56.857
Stay on the bed.

01:10:56.953 --> 01:10:58.593
- We're clear!
- Keep moving.

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:02.292
Stack up!

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:04.193
Okay. Ready?

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:06.402
Yup. Door.

01:11:16.773 --> 01:11:18.719
You get him!
Go, go, go. Let's roll.

01:11:18.875 --> 01:11:20.047
Okay, move it!

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:22.612
Fuck!

01:11:22.712 --> 01:11:23.952
We're tight, pop it!

01:11:26.916 --> 01:11:27.951
Asshole down!

01:11:37.093 --> 01:11:38.401
We're clear!

01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:50.740
Fuck!

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:51.808
Go! Go! Go!

01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:55.756
Target down.
Move! Move! Move!

01:12:06.489 --> 01:12:07.763
Clear!

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:16.768
Clear!

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:17.868
Clear!

01:12:18.768 --> 01:12:19.803
Sugar, let's go.

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:28.479
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!
Cálmate! Easy! Easy!

01:12:30.046 --> 01:12:31.684
- Good kill, baby.
- Come on!

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:32.816
I got the hostage.
Clear!

01:12:32.882 --> 01:12:33.883
Going right!

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:35.793
- Clear!
- Clear!

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:39.459
- We're clear!
- Clear!

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:43.026
Good fucking gunfight!
God damn!

01:12:43.125 --> 01:12:45.036
- Hello.
- Hey, boss!

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:46.470
You might want to get in here!

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:48.301
What?

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:51.242
Ta-da!

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:53.136
You got your kit, babe?

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:55.823
Right, we're secure.
I'm gonna ID these guys.

01:12:56.806 --> 01:12:58.308
So which asshole are you?

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:00.347
Lizzy, don't fucking do that!

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:02.920
Liquid meth! Hell yeah!

01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:06.407
You're one fucked up bitch!

01:13:08.084 --> 01:13:09.392
Yeah, it's meth.

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:10.555
This is one
for the books.

01:13:10.653 --> 01:13:11.723
Breach.

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:14.155
It's not them.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.702
- It's not the Kaibiles!
- What do you mean?

01:13:15.758 --> 01:13:16.798
What are you talking about?

01:13:16.826 --> 01:13:18.863
You mean we killed six
motherfuckers and it ain't them?

01:13:18.928 --> 01:13:20.100
Well, check again!

01:13:20.363 --> 01:13:21.671
<i>Okay. -</i>

01:13:23.432 --> 01:13:25.605
No! Still not them!

01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:28.079
Dead man walking!
Fuck me!

01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:29.511
Fucking shit.

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:55.532
Stay tight.
Behind you, brother.

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.487
All right, it's clear.

01:14:17.086 --> 01:14:18.258
Get EMS in here.

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:20.123
There's a lot of bodies.

01:14:21.090 --> 01:14:22.763
What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:25.266
It's my job.

01:14:26.062 --> 01:14:27.439
You used me.

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:33.573
Breacher, God damn it!

01:14:33.636 --> 01:14:35.411
What the fuck is going on here?

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.747
Clean up, aisle three.

01:14:39.075 --> 01:14:40.418
God almighty!

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:42.957
What's wrong? Son of
a bitch is snagged!

01:14:43.012 --> 01:14:44.320
Gimme a knife. I'm gonna
cut the son of a bitch.

01:14:44.413 --> 01:14:46.324
The hell you are.
That's a new anchor.

01:14:46.415 --> 01:14:48.258
Damn, it is heavy, though.
Yeah, it is!

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:50.160
All right, keep pulling.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.922
What the hell?

01:14:53.122 --> 01:14:55.432
Jesus Christ!
Stay back, son!

01:14:55.524 --> 01:14:57.128
Turn around.
Don't look.

01:15:22.785 --> 01:15:23.889
How'd they die?

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:25.463
Looks like a gun fight.

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:27.797
Can you give me race and sex?

01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:29.663
Male Hispanics, all three.

01:15:30.126 --> 01:15:31.628
Why the chicken wire?

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:36.367
As their bodies bloat, the wire cuts
them, releasing the decomp gas.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:38.573
They never float to the surface.

01:15:38.968 --> 01:15:41.008
Yeah, great tip.
I gotta remember that one.

01:15:41.404 --> 01:15:42.678
Okay, how long they been dead?

01:15:42.738 --> 01:15:43.876
A week.
You sure?

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:45.646
A what?
At least a week.

01:15:45.741 --> 01:15:47.687
If it's the guys
that we think...

01:15:48.177 --> 01:15:50.214
They've been dead more than a week...
Wait, are these the...

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:52.724
The military guys from the cartel?
Yeah.

01:15:52.815 --> 01:15:55.022
You think this is them?
The Guatemalans.

01:15:55.084 --> 01:15:56.084
I think it's them.

01:15:56.152 --> 01:15:57.756
He said they've
been dead for a week.

01:15:57.853 --> 01:15:58.991
It can't be the Guatemalans.

01:15:59.321 --> 01:16:01.392
That's why
we need to find these tattoos.

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:04.061
The guy at the cabin had a
tattoo on his left shoulder.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.436
And if we have a match, then they're
part of the same gang, right?

01:16:06.529 --> 01:16:07.769
The killers are the victims?

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:09.342
It just can't be that, Caroline.

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:11.400
Tattoo, left shoulder.
Have we got anything?

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.843
Ah, nice!

01:16:13.536 --> 01:16:15.777
We got it.
Darius, come see this.

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:17.350
This is our guy.

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.386
That's it'?
Mmm-hmm.

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:20.745
Who the hell killed them?

01:16:20.843 --> 01:16:21.844
Nice.

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.015
Here we go.

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:24.080
What you got?

01:16:25.448 --> 01:16:27.052
Thumb's missing.

01:16:27.183 --> 01:16:29.288
Right here.
Right.

01:16:29.518 --> 01:16:35.093
Okay, so that explains how we got
thumbprints in Roberts' RV, huh?

01:16:35.191 --> 01:16:36.711
Looks like
we're working late.

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:49.979
Look, if they've been dead
a week already, right?

01:16:50.072 --> 01:16:52.712
They sure as hell didn't
nail Jordan to that ceiling.

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:54.550
Or drive Roberts
over the train tracks.

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:56.783
The Guatemalans
killed Tripod McNeely, okay?

01:16:57.379 --> 01:16:59.916
Then somebody kills them,
uses them for cover.

01:17:00.049 --> 01:17:01.960
Come on, Darius, think about it.

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:04.062
Who killed the cartel hit men,

01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:06.600
sprinkles their DNA over
two separate crime scenes,

01:17:06.655 --> 01:17:08.828
wants us to think they're alive'?
Who do we like for this?

01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:12.428
Everybody! We like
everybody for this one!

01:17:24.573 --> 01:17:26.314
<i>{on TAPE)
John, please! John!</i>

01:17:26.976 --> 01:17:28.853
<i>Tell John to come for you!
John! Please, John!</i>

01:17:28.944 --> 01:17:31.618
<i>Tell him come for you!
John!</i>

01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:34.761
<i>Come find me! John!</i>

01:17:35.584 --> 01:17:36.995
<i>Please!</i>

01:17:41.924 --> 01:17:43.335
<i>Oh' no!</i>

01:17:52.468 --> 01:17:53.879
<i>We had a good time, didn't we'!?</i>

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.660
<i>1 love you, John!</i>

01:19:13.349 --> 01:19:15.056
Who the fuck is hunting us?

01:19:15.117 --> 01:19:17.893
Who do
you think, Breach?

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:19.455
It's one of us.

01:19:20.356 --> 01:19:21.357
It's you!

01:19:21.457 --> 01:19:22.868
Or it's Grinder!

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:25.470
Or Sugar! Or my dear
loving husband!

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:28.067
Is it you, bitch?

01:19:28.230 --> 01:19:30.141
No, I keep track
of the people I whack.

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:33.235
Neck and Pyro ain't on the list.

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:35.441
See, I think that she's right!

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:38.950
I think she's fucking right.
Nailed it.

01:19:39.742 --> 01:19:41.221
So which fucker is ii, huh?

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:48.485
Fucking crazy!
I mean, why?

01:19:48.584 --> 01:19:50.962
You know why, Breach.
It was the fucking money.

01:19:51.053 --> 01:19:52.225
Amen.

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:55.065
'Cause some of us
are getting paid,

01:19:55.224 --> 01:19:57.500
and the rest of us
are just getting dead.

01:19:57.593 --> 01:19:58.731
Oh, bullshit!

01:19:59.261 --> 01:20:01.434
Keep your hands
where we can see them.

01:20:02.097 --> 01:20:04.407
This has been fun,
but I'm out of here.

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:08.277
I see any of your fucking
faces and I'll kill you!

01:20:09.171 --> 01:20:11.412
Ammo's cheap.
My life ain't!

01:20:14.143 --> 01:20:15.247
It's over.

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:19.152
Where'd you bury it, Grinder?

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:29.803
Now we fall apart?

01:20:31.126 --> 01:20:32.799
We scatter to the wind?

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:35.165
Yeah,
I like that idea.

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:39.506
Honey.

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:41.346
Yes, sweetheart?

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:44.818
I've been fucking Sugar.

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:49.116
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:20:50.112 --> 01:20:52.183
That's not what we talked about!

01:20:52.281 --> 01:20:53.282
Look, man.

01:20:54.116 --> 01:20:55.789
Look, it is what it is, dude.

01:20:56.452 --> 01:20:58.693
What do you want me to say?
You want me to say I'm sorry?

01:20:59.021 --> 01:21:00.830
Is it gonna make it any better?

01:21:01.156 --> 01:21:02.863
You fucker!
I'm going to kill you!

01:21:02.958 --> 01:21:04.301
Monster! No!

01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.397
I thought you were
my fucking friend!

01:21:07.329 --> 01:21:09.969
Boss, I'm gonna kill him!
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:11.668
Get the fuck out of here!

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:14.303
Why the fuck would
you do that shit?

01:21:14.370 --> 01:21:15.974
Get the fuck out of here!

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:18.678
Fucking have a nice life,
you fucking cunt!

01:21:18.741 --> 01:21:19.879
You deserve each other!

01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:23.389
I warned you.

01:21:25.814 --> 01:21:27.418
We fucked up.

01:21:28.917 --> 01:21:30.897
We fucked up, didn't we?

01:21:43.332 --> 01:21:44.333
What do you want?

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.343
Can we talk?

01:21:48.003 --> 01:21:49.505
We stole the money.

01:21:52.508 --> 01:21:54.510
It was Breacher's idea.

01:21:54.576 --> 01:21:56.681
We thought it
would make him happy.

01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:59.689
It was $10 million in cash.

01:22:00.716 --> 01:22:03.219
Went back for it that night,

01:22:03.285 --> 01:22:06.289
but when we got there,
it was gone.

01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:09.563
DEA, they wanted to
throw us in a hole

01:22:09.625 --> 01:22:11.104
and throw away the hole.

01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:14.898
Crawled up our asses with a
microscope for six months.

01:22:15.764 --> 01:22:17.243
Nobody broke.

01:22:19.101 --> 01:22:20.944
So who has the money?

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:23.439
It's Lizzy.

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:26.215
Or Monster or Sugar.

01:22:27.209 --> 01:22:28.620
I don't know.

01:22:28.710 --> 01:22:30.314
She's playing one
against the other.

01:22:31.814 --> 01:22:33.452
What do you want to do?

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:36.321
Fuck them all.
Let them hang.

01:22:46.762 --> 01:22:48.764
After I lost my family,

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:51.972
I asked myself what
was I fighting for.

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:54.604
The answer was simple.

01:22:54.736 --> 01:22:55.976
My team.

01:22:57.272 --> 01:23:00.116
I wanted them to get
something out of all of this.

01:23:00.175 --> 01:23:01.176
But instead,

01:23:03.579 --> 01:23:05.183
I destroyed them.

01:23:07.015 --> 01:23:09.586
Agent Phillips is
going to the DEA.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:18.699
I'm not telling you
it's gonna be okay.

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:22.302
Because it's not.

01:23:23.432 --> 01:23:25.275
Not for you.

01:23:45.787 --> 01:23:47.391
Hey, John.
Hey.

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:53.297
I'm sorry.

01:23:54.730 --> 01:23:56.334
Don't apologize.

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:01.913
I would have stepped
up if you didn't.

01:24:03.839 --> 01:24:05.477
You're doing the right thing.

01:24:06.875 --> 01:24:08.752
I ride this ship down.

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:11.218
I ride it down.

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:13.488
But you,

01:24:14.349 --> 01:24:16.022
you could still
have a life after this.

01:24:16.151 --> 01:24:17.721
Doing what, John?

01:24:18.887 --> 01:24:20.161
Where?

01:24:20.923 --> 01:24:22.732
This is all I do.

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.326
And it's over.

01:24:26.328 --> 01:24:27.500
We can protect you.

01:24:30.332 --> 01:24:31.606
Get down!

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:33.674
Stay down.

01:24:49.718 --> 01:24:51.220
Tell me again.

01:24:52.087 --> 01:24:54.533
We were up the block,
heard gunfire.

01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:57.196
We made contact with
a female DEA agent.

01:24:57.593 --> 01:24:58.936
Female DEA agent?

01:24:59.094 --> 01:25:01.096
She left in a vehicle
with a black male.

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:04.143
A DEA agent.
You heard gunfire!

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:06.371
Sir, she badged us.
She was legit.

01:25:06.435 --> 01:25:07.778
She left.

01:25:07.869 --> 01:25:09.212
Is this the woman you saw?

01:25:09.538 --> 01:25:11.142
Yeah. That's her.

01:25:13.075 --> 01:25:14.110
You said "black male"?

01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:16.450
Yes, sir.
A red vehicle.

01:25:16.578 --> 01:25:18.580
Sugar That's your guy, too?

01:25:49.911 --> 01:25:51.254
Clear.

01:25:57.119 --> 01:25:58.257
What's all this?

01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.594
She's bailing.

01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:03.497
She'll never make it. Every cop
in Georgia's looking for her.

01:26:03.592 --> 01:26:05.003
She won't get far.

01:26:05.761 --> 01:26:07.001
Yes, she will.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:13.361
Do you think
that he loves you?

01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:17.014
What do you think the plan is? To
just go run off and make babies?

01:26:18.774 --> 01:26:20.515
Well, you're gonna
be needing this.

01:26:25.781 --> 01:26:26.851
Just give me my shit

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:28.723
and quit fucking around.

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:39.668
Don't do it! Monster!

01:26:42.631 --> 01:26:43.803
Fuck you!

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:50.406
Oh, fuck.

01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.344
Baby, I'm sorry!

01:26:56.311 --> 01:26:58.222
Baby. Oh, God.

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:00.720
Lay down.

01:27:04.252 --> 01:27:05.993
I'm sorry, Monster.
I'm sorry.

01:27:20.535 --> 01:27:21.775
Oh, Jesus!

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:25.711
Jesus!

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:57.880
I'm going to kill her.

01:28:02.711 --> 01:28:03.711
Yeah?

01:28:03.745 --> 01:28:05.486
<i>Hey. I fucked up.</i>

01:28:05.814 --> 01:28:07.760
<i>I didn't mean for this to happen.
I don't know what to do.</i>

01:28:07.916 --> 01:28:09.725
Where are you?
Midtown.

01:28:09.985 --> 01:28:11.896
<i>Are you alone?
Yeah, I'm alone'</i>

01:28:12.387 --> 01:28:14.094
Who would I be with?

01:28:14.723 --> 01:28:18.330
Can <i>I</i> see you? Meet me inside
the parking structure on 4th.

01:28:18.426 --> 01:28:20.906
<i>Thanks, Breach.
Hi see you soon.</i>

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:26.310
That motherfucker!

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:27.812
Parking garage?

01:28:28.403 --> 01:28:29.438
<i>Mmm.</i>

01:28:29.504 --> 01:28:31.745
This ain't his first rodeo.

01:28:32.107 --> 01:28:33.677
Since he wants to be a hero,

01:28:35.243 --> 01:28:36.654
let's give him somebody to save.

01:28:41.850 --> 01:28:45.297
Federal agent! Get out of the fucking car!
Did you hear me?

01:28:46.087 --> 01:28:47.862
Open the fucking door!
Open the fucking door!

01:28:47.989 --> 01:28:49.310
Get out of
the fucking car!

01:29:04.139 --> 01:29:06.619
There she is. Get down.

01:29:41.643 --> 01:29:42.986
He's down!
He's down!

01:29:50.085 --> 01:29:51.564
Who the fuck is that in the car?

01:29:56.558 --> 01:29:57.662
Shit!

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:58.898
It's that bitch!

01:30:17.946 --> 01:30:18.947
Go, go, go!

01:30:27.956 --> 01:30:30.266
Hold your ass, sweetie!
Here we go!

01:30:40.869 --> 01:30:41.939
Jesus Christ!

01:30:44.139 --> 01:30:45.379
Take the vest!

01:30:45.874 --> 01:30:47.751
Put it on the dash
and stay down!

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:51.485
Fuck me!

01:30:51.713 --> 01:30:53.488
Lizzy, handle that motherfucker!

01:30:58.720 --> 01:30:59.892
Oh, fuck!

01:31:09.898 --> 01:31:11.741
Oh, baby, l fucked

01:31:14.069 --> 01:31:15.070
Jesus Christ!

01:31:17.405 --> 01:31:18.406
Fuck!

01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:30.925
Get the fuck out of the way!

01:31:40.195 --> 01:31:41.640
We lost them, Sug!

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:42.868
Oh, shit.

01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:45.001
We're gonna make it, baby.
We're gonna make it!

01:31:49.437 --> 01:31:50.973
Fuck, he's still coming!

01:31:54.009 --> 01:31:55.352
Let's give him a 180!

01:32:04.119 --> 01:32:05.120
Shit!

01:32:05.186 --> 01:32:06.547
Turn around!
Turn around!

01:32:06.888 --> 01:32:07.992
I can't make it!

01:32:10.191 --> 01:32:11.329
Baby,

01:32:12.127 --> 01:32:13.538

01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:19.701
Fuck!

01:32:26.074 --> 01:32:27.553
Shoot the fucking engine!

01:32:29.144 --> 01:32:30.487
Fucking die!

01:32:32.981 --> 01:32:34.016
Watch out!

01:32:36.418 --> 01:32:37.979
Now, get us
the fuck out of here!

01:32:39.220 --> 01:32:40.221
Fuck!

01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:42.932
I got no eyes!

01:32:43.024 --> 01:32:44.367
I can't see shit!

01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.431
Drop the weapon, Lizzy!

01:33:25.967 --> 01:33:27.969
Okay. Okay.

01:33:30.438 --> 01:33:31.883
Hey, Breach.

01:33:34.476 --> 01:33:36.217
You killed my team.

01:33:37.378 --> 01:33:39.221
Why, Lizzy'? Why?

01:33:39.647 --> 01:33:42.423
Because they stole
my money! Huh!

01:33:43.051 --> 01:33:44.587
They fucking robbed me!

01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:47.300
After everything I put up with!

01:33:47.455 --> 01:33:50.265
It was my money and they took
it, and l couldn't find it!

01:33:51.326 --> 01:33:53.101
I said, "Fuck them."

01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:57.302
I took the money.
I took it.

01:33:57.732 --> 01:33:59.234
You took the money?

01:34:00.335 --> 01:34:01.643
What does that mean?

01:34:02.637 --> 01:34:03.638
Why?

01:34:07.909 --> 01:34:09.115
Mexico.

01:34:10.111 --> 01:34:12.113
This is about fucking Mexico?

01:34:13.081 --> 01:34:16.290
Your family is
never coming home!

01:34:17.318 --> 01:34:18.991
What is she talking about?

01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:21.464
And nothing you do

01:34:21.523 --> 01:34:23.002
will ever change that!

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:26.131
You hear me?

01:34:30.498 --> 01:34:32.444
What the fuck was that'?

01:34:36.304 --> 01:34:39.945
Just be a good
girl and walk away.

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:46.723
Hey! Hey!

01:34:46.814 --> 01:34:47.952
What the fuck...

01:34:48.683 --> 01:34:49.855
I can't.

01:34:49.951 --> 01:34:53.194
- Pull it together. You okay?
- Yeah.

01:34:53.321 --> 01:34:55.232
Okay, you hurt? Anything'?
No, I'm okay.

01:34:55.323 --> 01:34:56.483
All right, just take it easy.

01:34:56.558 --> 01:34:58.538
Where's Breacher?
He's right there.

01:34:59.194 --> 01:35:00.798
Where the fuck is he?
He was right there.

01:35:02.130 --> 01:35:03.700
We've got three vics.

01:35:03.798 --> 01:35:04.799
We've got to find him.

01:35:04.866 --> 01:35:06.004
Shit!

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:07.171
Find Breacher!

01:35:07.302 --> 01:35:08.742
You heard her,
spread out!

01:35:10.572 --> 01:35:12.483
- Check the truck!
- On it. On it.

01:35:12.807 --> 01:35:14.650
No! Nothing!

01:35:14.842 --> 01:35:17.721
I don't see him.
I don't see him.

01:35:21.649 --> 01:35:24.027
What the fuck happened,
Caroline?

01:35:25.587 --> 01:35:27.589
What the fuck did you do?

01:39:29.397 --> 01:39:30.398
Mmm.

01:39:41.476 --> 01:39:42.921
You're mine.

01:39:53.654 --> 01:39:54.655
Your wife.

01:39:54.755 --> 01:39:57.031
I was the last to have her.

01:39:57.124 --> 01:39:58.432
You can't take that back.

01:39:59.494 --> 01:40:01.098
I can take your family.

01:40:03.264 --> 01:40:05.107
But I'm not like you.
