WEBVTT

00:26.109 --> 00:27.152
Stop.

01:38.557 --> 01:39.558
Carl?

01:46.023 --> 01:47.941
Please stay inside, Your Honor.

01:48.692 --> 01:49.901
What's going on?

01:49.902 --> 01:51.486
The sheriff didn't clean, ma'am.

01:55.574 --> 01:59.411
<i>Return to your homes
as quickly and quietly as possible.</i>

02:00.120 --> 02:02.706
<i>Your safety is our only concern.</i>

02:05.083 --> 02:08.503
<i>Return to your homes
as quickly and quietly as possible.</i>

02:09.545 --> 02:11.673
<i>Your safety is our only concern.</i>

02:14.259 --> 02:17.887
<i>Return to your homes as
quickly and quietly as possible.</i>

02:17.888 --> 02:19.222
Nichols went over the hill.

02:19.223 --> 02:20.848
- I know.
- I couldn't find you.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.099
I called in the alarm.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.185
Scrambled the off-duty
and the reserved raiders.

02:24.186 --> 02:27.523
Good. Announce
an 8:00 p.m. emergency curfew,

02:28.106 --> 02:30.525
putting the sheriff's deputies
under your command.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.068
I also need eyes on Nichols's father.

02:32.069 --> 02:33.486
Don't harass him.

02:33.487 --> 02:36.072
Just see who he's talking to
and who talks to him.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.491
Sending Nichols out to clean
was supposed to prevent this.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.243
I will be making a speech later today.

02:40.244 --> 02:41.702
Do you hear what's going on?

02:41.703 --> 02:44.205
People are saying
it's time for another rebellion.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.207
That's why they need to know
what happened today.

02:46.208 --> 02:47.542
It's under investigation.

02:47.543 --> 02:49.252
We're talking to everyone
who knew Nichols.

02:49.253 --> 02:50.546
I know what happened.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.464
There are two people in the Down Deep
I need detained.

02:53.465 --> 02:54.550
Take them into custody.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.093
Bet they're loving this down there.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.595
Hey!

02:59.429 --> 03:02.849
People, let's calm down.

03:02.850 --> 03:07.645
Let's calm down. Please. Quiet.

03:07.646 --> 03:08.980
Listen to me.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.399
<i>Return to your homes
as quickly and quietly...</i>

03:11.400 --> 03:13.901
No, you can't cut off
official announcements!

03:13.902 --> 03:14.987
<i>Your safety is our--</i>

03:15.988 --> 03:18.282
Hey! No. Come on, move it out.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.324
Come on.

03:20.325 --> 03:21.617
I don't make the rules.

03:21.618 --> 03:22.995
Hank, fuck you!

03:23.620 --> 03:25.788
I just watched, the same as you.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.040
She walked over the hill.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.418
That means it's safe.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.628
I wanna go out too.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.755
Don't say that. You can't say that.

03:34.756 --> 03:38.050
Please calm down. You can't say that.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.177
Move.

03:39.178 --> 03:43.556
Hank, give it up.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.975
- You're in over your head.
- Yes!

03:45.976 --> 03:48.644
You need to shut the fuck up
and listen to these people.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.562
Yes!

03:49.563 --> 03:52.523
- We got a right to ask questions.
- Yes!

03:52.524 --> 03:54.525
- Don't we?
- Yes!

03:54.526 --> 03:57.821
We just saw something no one
has ever seen before.

03:58.864 --> 04:01.490
- And we all want to know what that means.
- Yes.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.869
Juliette Nichols was one of our own.

04:05.287 --> 04:07.039
Then why'd you turn her in?

04:17.382 --> 04:18.257
I did.

04:23.847 --> 04:27.226
Jules is like family to me,
but I had to make a choice.

04:29.728 --> 04:30.896
They knew she was here.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.148
They'd have torn our homes apart.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.026
They're just looking for an excuse.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.029
They think we're dumb animals.
We have to show them--

04:40.030 --> 04:43.658
They'll think different after we cut off
the power and shut down the Silo.

04:43.659 --> 04:45.785
Yes!

04:45.786 --> 04:46.954
Once!

04:48.872 --> 04:50.832
We can shut the Silo down once.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.000
And then they'll crush us.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.003
We all saw Jules walk over the hill.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.215
We're not gonna listen to lies anymore.
We want the truth.

05:01.426 --> 05:02.553
Listen to me!

05:03.345 --> 05:04.346
Listen.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.487
Most of us got jobs to get back to,
don't we?

05:27.119 --> 05:28.662
You gotta stop.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.956
This place is a tinderbox.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.457
Is that an order?

05:33.458 --> 05:34.585
Yes.

07:19.690 --> 07:20.941
Doctor?

07:21.775 --> 07:22.901
Dr. Nichols?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.408
The Anderson baby won't stop crying.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.214
How'd you do this, little one?

07:44.923 --> 07:45.924
What?

07:46.717 --> 07:48.468
She dislocated her elbow.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.682
There you go.

07:54.516 --> 07:55.559
All done.

07:57.561 --> 07:58.645
Do you want me to...

07:59.354 --> 08:00.439
Poor little girl.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.159
Poor little girl.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.334
You're serious.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.586
The Sheriff's Department reports to you?

08:23.587 --> 08:25.923
For now. It's only temporary, Paul.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.549
And we're getting
the sheriff's apartment cleaned out.

08:28.550 --> 08:31.762
Bernard wants you and your family
to move in there as soon as possible.

08:32.638 --> 08:34.639
He wants things to get back to normal.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.517
She walked over the hill.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.227
How are things going to be normal?

08:40.020 --> 08:44.441
By us. All of us acting coolly and calmly.

08:53.659 --> 08:56.410
Are there any other parts of the Pact
Bernard plans on ignoring?

08:56.411 --> 08:57.662
Paul, this is an emergency.

08:57.663 --> 09:00.122
Am I still supposed to write
my report on Nichols's cleaning?

09:00.123 --> 09:01.208
Of course.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.921
I still haven't gotten your statement.

09:07.798 --> 09:09.925
Nichols saying she wanted to go out.

09:16.932 --> 09:20.227
All right, here's my statement.

09:21.520 --> 09:25.190
Bernard believed Nichols was
in violation of our relic laws.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.151
He led her to the cornfield
to keep her arrest non-disruptive.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.071
Once he confronted her about
the red-level relic in her possession--

09:32.072 --> 09:33.489
A relic he later destroyed.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.617
For the safety of the Silo.

09:37.035 --> 09:40.789
Once he confronted her, which I observed,
Nichols said she wanted to go out.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.875
As raiders came in
to apprehend her, she ran.

09:43.876 --> 09:45.543
They chased her and caught her.

09:45.544 --> 09:46.669
End of statement.

09:46.670 --> 09:47.754
That do it?

09:51.508 --> 09:52.426
One thing.

09:54.344 --> 10:00.100
If Nichols just said
she wanted to go out, why did she run?

10:01.977 --> 10:02.895
I don't know.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.647
She must have changed her mind.

10:12.487 --> 10:13.947
What if she's still alive?

10:16.074 --> 10:19.577
We can't just sit here when
she might still be out there somewhere.

10:19.578 --> 10:20.871
She's not alive.

10:21.997 --> 10:24.166
There's only so much air in that suit.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.795
What was the note
you had me deliver to her?

10:29.671 --> 10:31.006
I figured you'd read it.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.800
Of course, I read it.
I just-- I didn't understand it.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.261
You weren't supposed to.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.681
Just a private joke
between me and my girl.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.726
You said they're good in supply.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.019
Is that about the tape?

10:45.020 --> 10:48.482
Why don't you leave me alone
to feel like shit for a while?

10:54.446 --> 10:55.614
I'm sorry, Walk.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.117
But...

11:00.327 --> 11:02.037
it's not enough to just mourn.

11:12.631 --> 11:13.549
Hey, Shirl.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.219
What do you want?

11:17.845 --> 11:20.514
I need to talk to Walker alone.

11:25.727 --> 11:26.728
Go on.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.158
How you doing?

11:40.742 --> 11:42.493
How the hell do you think I'm doing?

11:42.494 --> 11:45.746
Yeah. Yeah, dumb question. Sorry.

11:45.747 --> 11:46.665
Look...

11:48.125 --> 11:49.417
I'm sorry, Walker.

11:49.418 --> 11:52.171
But Judicial Security has
some questions they want to ask you.

11:53.547 --> 11:54.798
They know where to find me.

11:55.716 --> 11:58.468
I'm supposed to take you into custody.

11:59.219 --> 12:01.304
Sheriff's Department
works for Judicial now?

12:01.305 --> 12:03.348
As of an hour ago. Yes.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.268
You gotta come with me, Walk...

12:07.269 --> 12:08.353
And...

12:10.939 --> 12:12.649
I need to make it look good.

12:14.651 --> 12:15.735
It's not possible.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.071
They all say they won't clean
and they all do.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.865
Your Honor, I saw it.

12:20.699 --> 12:24.203
She held out the cleaning pad
and then she just dropped it.

12:26.622 --> 12:29.124
- But then it got--
- What? Did she decide not to die too?

12:31.502 --> 12:33.420
She walked over the hill.

12:37.966 --> 12:38.967
I don't believe you.

12:40.052 --> 12:41.386
Everybody saw it.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.016
Go, please.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.029
What now, Bernard?

13:34.398 --> 13:37.526
I thought we told you scum
from Mechanical to stay out of here.

13:41.738 --> 13:43.490
Good to see you, you son of a bitch.

13:44.408 --> 13:45.576
I missed you.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.911
Heard some crazy shit about your shadow.

13:48.912 --> 13:50.913
They must be pissed off up top.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.791
Yeah, they're coming down on everybody.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.043
Fuck 'em.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.671
They need us more than we need them.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.592
Feels different this time.

14:03.302 --> 14:06.221
Yeah, it does. But you'll handle it.

14:07.222 --> 14:08.557
You're your old man's son.

14:10.642 --> 14:13.061
Sometimes I'm not sure if
that's a good thing or a bad thing.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.398
Trust me, it's a good thing.

14:17.608 --> 14:19.359
Hadn't been for him,
I'd never have made it out.

14:27.618 --> 14:28.660
I need some help.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.205
Okay. If I can.

14:32.289 --> 14:33.373
I got two asks.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.960
If anybody comes to you
and wants you to make weapons, don't.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.420
It's too dangerous.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.136
What's the second ask?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.234
You must know why I'm here.

15:01.610 --> 15:02.611
More or less.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.881
I'd make you a drink,
but I don't want you to stay that long.

15:25.217 --> 15:26.218
Understood.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.136
Feel free to have one yourself,
if you like.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.222
I stopped.

15:32.391 --> 15:33.475
You stopped?

15:36.520 --> 15:37.688
When?

15:38.522 --> 15:39.356
Today.

15:46.488 --> 15:50.909
I'm speaking to the Silo this evening
and I would like you to be behind me.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.079
Behind you?

15:54.580 --> 15:57.332
As a show of unity,
to reassure the people.

15:59.168 --> 16:00.169
But you're not ordering me.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.631
Well, with the lives
of 10,000 people at risk,

16:05.632 --> 16:07.342
I didn't think I'd have to order you.

16:10.512 --> 16:14.683
I came here myself to ask, out of respect.

16:15.184 --> 16:17.603
Do you know how she got over the hill?

16:19.479 --> 16:20.646
It had to be the tape.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.941
Someone was gonna figure
that out sooner or later.

16:23.734 --> 16:26.904
My mistake was not sending
Nichols to the mines when she stole it.

16:28.739 --> 16:30.157
You're frightened.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.327
Well, no one knows me better than you.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.246
So, do you imagine that an angry mob

16:37.247 --> 16:40.291
is gonna break down the door
and kill us all?

16:40.292 --> 16:43.045
I'm not afraid of what I imagine,
I'm afraid of what I saw.

16:44.213 --> 16:46.089
What she saw.
On the other side of that hill.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.591
Thousands and thousands of bodies.

16:48.592 --> 16:50.135
An entire silo dead.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.346
It looked like the Silo
went to war with itself.

16:53.347 --> 16:54.639
That's what scares me.

16:54.640 --> 16:56.517
Because if it happened there,
it could happen here.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.394
Your beloved <i>Order</i> lays out the protocols.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.771
For what to do if someone fails to clean.

17:01.772 --> 17:03.940
But <i>The Order</i> doesn't say anything
about what to do

17:03.941 --> 17:05.943
if someone walks out of fucking sight.

17:06.818 --> 17:09.779
The Founders never imagined it
or wouldn't admit it was possible.

17:09.780 --> 17:13.282
But today it happened,
and the entire Silo watched it happen.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.492
So, what are you gonna do?

17:15.493 --> 17:18.704
Well, that's what I'm here for,
to figure it out.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.000
Well, I can't help you.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.127
You were my shadow.

17:26.128 --> 17:29.132
- And then I wasn't.
- This is an emergency.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.433
I'll never fucking understand you.

17:39.059 --> 17:40.060
What was it, Mary?

17:41.728 --> 17:43.230
Twenty-five years of a secret.

17:44.815 --> 17:46.066
What are you holding on to?

17:48.026 --> 17:49.319
What aren't you telling me?

17:50.946 --> 17:52.197
You're hiding something.

17:54.157 --> 17:56.118
Well, I need your help

17:56.785 --> 17:58.703
and if you're not willing to do it
for old times' sake

17:58.704 --> 18:00.622
and you're not willing
to do it for the Silo,

18:01.582 --> 18:03.083
then what is it you fucking want?

18:04.459 --> 18:05.918
More living space?

18:05.919 --> 18:06.962
The pick of the relics?

18:07.754 --> 18:09.964
A bigger staff? What the fuck do you want?

18:09.965 --> 18:11.842
You still don't know me, do you?

18:15.095 --> 18:16.889
All right then.
I'll tell you what I'll settle for.

18:22.436 --> 18:25.898
In this story,
there is an all-powerful wizard

18:27.107 --> 18:28.859
who no one ever sees.

18:30.319 --> 18:32.654
And when they do,
he turns out to be a fraud...

18:33.780 --> 18:36.115
hiding behind a handful of cheap tricks.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.034
So I'm a fraud?

18:38.785 --> 18:40.871
No, I am.

18:43.415 --> 18:47.711
And at the end of the story, he gets
into a hot-air balloon and he flies away.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.256
That's what I want.

18:53.550 --> 18:54.676
Can you do that for me?

18:55.177 --> 18:57.554
Because if you can,
well, then I'll help you.

18:58.764 --> 18:59.765
But if you can't...

19:01.350 --> 19:02.976
well, then fuck off.

19:37.928 --> 19:41.056
I hate to do this to you,
but I gotta lock you up.

19:42.516 --> 19:46.185
What in hell's going on, Hank?
Since when do you lock up old ladies?

19:46.186 --> 19:49.815
Since I got orders to hold you
both for questioning by Judicial.

19:56.947 --> 20:00.284
You need anything,
holler until somebody comes.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.204
Where are you going?

20:05.205 --> 20:08.667
We gotta go make sure everybody's out
to hear the mayor's speech.

20:09.418 --> 20:12.003
First they want them all
staying inside their apartments,

20:12.004 --> 20:13.839
now they want 'em outside.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.258
Come on. Here, let's go.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.684
So, what did you tell 'em?

20:27.019 --> 20:28.562
Not a damn thing.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.772
I thought you said something.

20:31.356 --> 20:32.608
You know me better than that.

20:42.367 --> 20:45.036
Hank locked her
in the deputy station holding cell.

20:45.037 --> 20:46.454
McLain's there too.

20:46.455 --> 20:47.915
It's gotta be about the tape.

20:48.582 --> 20:50.875
The IT tape Jules stole was shit, right?

20:50.876 --> 20:55.088
I think Walker and McLain must have
switched it out with our heat tape.

20:55.631 --> 20:59.050
Wait, wait, you think Judicial
knew the suit tape didn't work?

20:59.051 --> 21:00.676
They had to.

21:00.677 --> 21:04.890
If we can get to Walk,
find out what she knows, we'll have proof.

21:05.557 --> 21:08.309
But why would people believe Walker
instead of Judicial?

21:08.310 --> 21:11.271
Because they just saw Juliette
walk over the hill.

21:17.027 --> 21:18.778
- The deal is--
- I have a plan.

21:18.779 --> 21:22.198
Judicial may suspect we did it
but they can't know for sure.

21:22.199 --> 21:23.909
Not about you.

21:24.660 --> 21:27.119
But that tape comes right back to me.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.996
- Maybe. But--
- No buts.

21:28.997 --> 21:33.334
Juliette came to me,
begged me to switch the tape.

21:33.335 --> 21:34.836
You had nothing to do with it.

21:34.837 --> 21:36.838
No, no. Hell with that.

21:36.839 --> 21:38.756
We keep our mouths shut,

21:38.757 --> 21:41.092
make them tell us
what they think happened.

21:41.093 --> 21:42.427
Then we deny everything.

21:43.011 --> 21:44.470
They know it was the tape.

21:44.471 --> 21:46.557
We're the only two people
who know that for sure.

21:47.641 --> 21:49.767
Keep our mouths shut.
We got a chance to brass it out.

21:49.768 --> 21:51.769
You old fool.

21:51.770 --> 21:54.689
They don't need us to tell them anything.

21:54.690 --> 21:57.608
They'll find some lowlife to denounce us

21:57.609 --> 22:01.905
and send us both
to the mines or out to clean.

22:03.240 --> 22:08.579
The only chance we got to box 'em in,
is for me to cop to it.

22:09.580 --> 22:12.791
I'm damned if I'm gonna watch them
punish you for something I started.

22:13.876 --> 22:15.877
Then they'll kill us both.

22:15.878 --> 22:18.755
That's gonna happen, sooner or later.

22:20.716 --> 22:22.301
Least this way, we get to go together.

22:55.375 --> 22:59.003
I know many of you are feeling uncertain

22:59.004 --> 23:02.883
or unsettled by what you saw
earlier today.

23:05.344 --> 23:10.474
But I am here to tell you
that today was a good day.

23:11.767 --> 23:16.188
Today was the first day of a new era.

23:17.689 --> 23:19.942
For as long as we can remember,

23:20.692 --> 23:24.947
everyone that went out to clean,
died on that hillside.

23:25.739 --> 23:29.660
Killed by the dangerous toxins
of an unsafe world.

23:31.245 --> 23:33.330
But today, that changed.

23:34.456 --> 23:38.042
Sheriff Nichols asked to go out.

23:38.043 --> 23:39.962
Sheriff Nichols went out.

23:42.297 --> 23:44.549
She chose not to clean.

23:44.550 --> 23:48.679
- She's a traitor.
- No, she was not a traitor.

23:49.847 --> 23:51.974
Juliette Nichols was a fighter.

23:52.683 --> 23:57.646
I disagreed with her about many things,
but I respected her.

23:58.313 --> 24:01.357
And never more so than I did today.

24:01.358 --> 24:02.901
She's alive.

24:03.986 --> 24:05.362
No.

24:06.488 --> 24:08.949
No. I wish that were true...

24:10.284 --> 24:12.494
I really wish it were.

24:15.914 --> 24:21.545
But she died a hero to the Silo.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.256
It's impossible.

24:25.340 --> 24:29.428
Do you all want to listen
to these gentlemen yell?

24:30.220 --> 24:34.057
Or do you want to hear
why Juliette was a hero?

24:37.144 --> 24:38.395
Before she went out...

24:40.564 --> 24:43.192
I asked Sheriff Nichols

24:44.109 --> 24:46.694
if we could seal her suit
with a new kind of tape.

24:46.695 --> 24:51.991
A tape recently developed
by our brilliant suit technicians.

24:51.992 --> 24:53.535
And she--

24:54.828 --> 24:57.247
she courageously agreed.

25:00.375 --> 25:02.377
Her trip over that hill

25:03.212 --> 25:08.591
proved that our new tape
provided better protection

25:08.592 --> 25:11.052
against the dangers outside.

25:11.053 --> 25:17.726
And that is the first step forward
in our lifetime.

25:25.108 --> 25:26.818
And we are not finished.

25:27.611 --> 25:32.574
We will keep finding ways
to make our suits better and stronger.

25:33.534 --> 25:39.163
And to produce tape that may someday
protect all of us

25:39.164 --> 25:40.749
from the dangers outside

25:41.416 --> 25:48.006
and bring us closer to our ultimate goal
of safely leaving the Silo.

26:02.062 --> 26:06.191
I'd like to thank the mayor
for this exemplary new development,

26:06.859 --> 26:12.363
and commend him
for his decisive leadership

26:12.364 --> 26:14.032
at this critical time.

26:15.367 --> 26:20.162
I hereby decree,
by the powers given to me by the Pact,

26:20.163 --> 26:24.208
five credits be bestowed
upon every household

26:24.209 --> 26:26.837
to celebrate this great achievement.

26:28.589 --> 26:33.342
We can only hope
that this new tape will lead to a new day

26:33.343 --> 26:35.720
for each and every one of us.

26:35.721 --> 26:37.139
They're lying.

26:38.307 --> 26:43.728
Juliette discovered that IT
was using bad tape on purpose.

26:43.729 --> 26:48.065
This isn't new tape,
this is the good tape we use.

26:48.066 --> 26:53.738
And they didn't plan to use it,
someone from Mechanical switched the tape.

26:53.739 --> 26:56.491
- The mayor's lying.
- Hey!

26:57.659 --> 26:59.953
- What's your name?
- Juliette Nichols.

27:02.956 --> 27:05.125
- Come with me.
- What's the problem?

27:06.543 --> 27:08.961
- She's one of my people.
- She's under arrest.

27:08.962 --> 27:11.381
- You need to step back.
- Whoa.

27:12.925 --> 27:14.927
This your first time below 120?

27:17.346 --> 27:18.639
I'm Knox.

27:21.099 --> 27:23.227
I can promise you,
she's not a troublemaker.

27:23.936 --> 27:25.521
She's just having a bad day.

27:26.647 --> 27:29.816
She lost a friend and she's been drinking,

27:30.734 --> 27:32.903
but she's one of the best techs
in the Silo.

27:34.154 --> 27:35.821
This deputy will vouch for her.

27:35.822 --> 27:36.990
Hank?

27:39.034 --> 27:41.787
I'm trying to explain how I can't afford
to lose Shirley right now.

27:44.039 --> 27:45.790
Yeah, we'll keep an eye on her.

27:45.791 --> 27:47.543
She'll be home before curfew.

27:50.212 --> 27:52.756
That mouth of hers
will get her sent to the mines.

27:59.471 --> 28:01.306
Thank you. I owe you.

28:01.849 --> 28:03.183
I'd say you both do.

28:09.398 --> 28:11.899
Come on. We need to talk.

28:11.900 --> 28:14.236
We have nothing to talk about.

28:17.990 --> 28:19.116
Fuck.

28:20.784 --> 28:21.952
Follow her.

28:29.251 --> 28:32.628
We threw in a couple of extra lines,
just to make it look real.

28:32.629 --> 28:34.672
And you've been paid fairly for it.

28:34.673 --> 28:36.758
You need us again, you say the word.

28:37.634 --> 28:39.720
Until I do, keep your mouths shut.

28:40.679 --> 28:42.848
Or you won't just go back to detention.

28:58.280 --> 29:00.157
Okay, I took care of the hecklers.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.825
They were good, by the way.

29:02.826 --> 29:04.036
Nice job.

29:04.536 --> 29:05.579
Thanks.

29:07.664 --> 29:09.123
Do you know what it is?

29:09.124 --> 29:10.334
I do.

29:11.126 --> 29:12.293
Was it important?

29:12.294 --> 29:14.796
No, but it is now.

29:16.298 --> 29:19.134
What's the mood like out there?
Any incidents?

29:19.760 --> 29:22.553
People are back in their homes.
No violence reported.

29:22.554 --> 29:24.639
Deputies are all with us.

29:24.640 --> 29:27.100
Watchers have eyes on known troublemakers.

29:27.726 --> 29:29.019
You turned it around.

29:30.437 --> 29:31.480
For now.

29:32.272 --> 29:33.898
You know you don't have to do this alone.

29:33.899 --> 29:36.776
If I was your shadow, I could make sure
we would be okay and--

29:36.777 --> 29:39.320
The speech bought us a day, maybe two.

29:39.321 --> 29:42.240
Crisis is not over.
I need you right where you are.

29:42.241 --> 29:43.992
Now, I'd better go.

29:44.701 --> 29:47.412
Wouldn't wanna violate my own curfew.

30:00.509 --> 30:01.802
I didn't forget about you.

30:03.512 --> 30:05.681
Sorry you had to miss the mayor's speech.

30:08.350 --> 30:09.476
You...

30:13.647 --> 30:14.648
are free to go.

30:15.732 --> 30:18.068
You got 30 minutes till curfew. Go on.

30:19.987 --> 30:21.904
You said Judicial had questions.

30:21.905 --> 30:24.782
Yeah. They had questions earlier,
and now they don't.

30:24.783 --> 30:27.953
At least the mayor explained
how Juliette walked over the hill.

30:28.912 --> 30:30.204
What'd he say?

30:30.205 --> 30:32.624
It's a new kind of tape
IT just came up with.

30:35.627 --> 30:36.670
Come on.

30:38.714 --> 30:39.840
Thank you.

30:43.594 --> 30:45.136
- Mr. Mayor.
- Mr. Mayor.

30:45.137 --> 30:46.722
Thank you for your service.

31:17.503 --> 31:18.795
Sorry I'm late.

31:19.463 --> 31:20.547
Anthony asleep?

31:22.090 --> 31:24.050
Yeah, he asked where you were.

31:24.051 --> 31:26.386
I said, "I guess
Daddy doesn't love us anymore."

31:28.472 --> 31:29.473
Honey, I'm kidding.

31:30.849 --> 31:33.601
Sorry. I'm so tired I'm punchy,

31:33.602 --> 31:36.355
and it's gonna be like this
till the emergency's over.

31:38.357 --> 31:39.399
Here.

31:44.071 --> 31:45.239
I'll heat up your dinner.

31:46.198 --> 31:47.282
Thanks.

31:51.119 --> 31:53.371
Did you have a chance to talk to Bernard?

31:53.372 --> 31:57.834
I asked him straight-out, and he said
I was too valuable where I was.

31:57.835 --> 31:59.169
At least for now.

32:01.505 --> 32:03.131
The man needs a shadow.

32:03.632 --> 32:04.924
Even if it's not me.

32:04.925 --> 32:06.968
We both know it should be you.

32:06.969 --> 32:08.386
It has to be you.

32:08.387 --> 32:10.222
What is he waiting for?

32:13.100 --> 32:14.560
I'm trying to figure that out.

32:16.019 --> 32:17.937
Did you know Meadows
was gonna be there today?

32:17.938 --> 32:19.064
I didn't.

32:20.190 --> 32:22.818
And nobody's been able to tell me
why she was there.

32:26.864 --> 32:29.157
I can't remember the last time
she made an appearance.

32:29.908 --> 32:31.451
Sure caused a big stir.

32:34.872 --> 32:36.999
Did you work with her
when you were in Judicial?

32:37.499 --> 32:39.418
She didn't even know I was alive.

32:40.335 --> 32:43.380
But they said she was in IT
before she moved to Judicial.

32:44.923 --> 32:47.467
Did Meadows and Bernard
know each other back then?

32:48.719 --> 32:49.927
Yeah, possibly.

32:49.928 --> 32:52.346
He was already head of IT. Why?

32:52.347 --> 32:54.807
I told Bernard he didn't
have to handle this alone,

32:54.808 --> 32:57.060
and he didn't seem concerned.

32:57.686 --> 33:00.731
Which makes me think
maybe he wasn't handling it alone.

33:01.982 --> 33:04.109
You think he's talking to Meadows?

33:05.986 --> 33:07.154
I don't know.

33:08.739 --> 33:11.450
There was something about
the way he looked at her today.

33:18.957 --> 33:21.293
You're still full of surprises.

33:22.878 --> 33:23.921
Come in.

33:32.346 --> 33:34.264
Thank you for your endorsement.

33:36.517 --> 33:37.893
What changed your mind?

33:39.394 --> 33:41.647
To be honest,
I went there to watch you fail.

33:42.648 --> 33:44.358
To watch it all fall down around you.

33:45.192 --> 33:46.401
And?

33:48.987 --> 33:51.490
I never thought
you had any talent for politics.

33:52.282 --> 33:55.911
But in light of today's performance,

33:57.329 --> 33:58.664
I could be wrong.

34:00.707 --> 34:02.125
I wasn't bad, was I?

34:03.043 --> 34:06.128
I assume the hecklers were arranged for?

34:06.129 --> 34:09.381
Yeah, you don't wanna leave
anything like that to chance.

34:09.382 --> 34:12.219
And I think the cover story works.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.096
Works?

34:14.721 --> 34:16.223
It's ludicrous.

34:17.224 --> 34:20.185
But given the situation,
it does what you need it to do.

34:22.020 --> 34:24.022
I approached it like an equation.

34:25.732 --> 34:29.360
People saw a miracle happen,
and if I tried to tell them it didn't,

34:30.070 --> 34:32.613
some would buy it
but the mob saw what it saw.

34:32.614 --> 34:36.868
So, I gave them a story to explain
the two different kinds of tape.

34:36.869 --> 34:39.995
Now, if anyone tries
to tell a different story,

34:39.996 --> 34:42.206
then they have to disprove mine.

34:43.792 --> 34:46.210
And if that doesn't work,

34:47.254 --> 34:49.005
there's always brute force.

34:53.385 --> 34:56.596
Brute force works for a while, but--

34:56.597 --> 34:58.098
But what?

34:59.850 --> 35:01.852
You need to give them
something to believe in.

35:03.312 --> 35:05.313
That is why I need you.

35:05.314 --> 35:06.981
You don't need me.

35:06.982 --> 35:08.774
You proved that today.

35:08.775 --> 35:12.821
On my way up here,
I saw the same new graffiti three times.

35:13.906 --> 35:15.574
"JL."

35:16.491 --> 35:17.743
And that was up here.

35:18.619 --> 35:20.746
Who knows what's happening
in the Down Deep?

35:21.788 --> 35:23.206
The speech bought us a few days,

35:23.207 --> 35:26.752
but I can't manage this crisis
without you.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.213
Because I'm the only other person
who's been in that vault.

35:30.214 --> 35:33.717
Because you're the only other person
that I will listen to.

35:34.760 --> 35:37.095
I tried to find another shadow, but...

35:40.849 --> 35:42.351
You set the bar too high.

35:43.018 --> 35:45.228
Listen, when I asked
for your help earlier,

35:45.229 --> 35:48.815
I offered you incentives and bribes,
and I--

35:49.358 --> 35:52.611
I realize that was insulting.

35:53.237 --> 35:54.738
And patronizing.

35:56.031 --> 35:57.324
And I--

35:58.367 --> 36:00.953
I-- I apologize.

36:05.290 --> 36:06.458
Thank you.

36:12.798 --> 36:14.132
I want you to see something.

36:15.801 --> 36:18.344
We use hand signals to communicate.

36:18.345 --> 36:21.723
If people from the Mids join us,
we'll teach them how it works.

36:24.810 --> 36:26.352
Hey!

36:26.353 --> 36:28.981
Come into the light,
or we'll come drag you in.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.692
It's me.

36:33.485 --> 36:35.195
What are you doing here, Cooper?

36:40.325 --> 36:41.743
Knox told me to follow you.

36:42.369 --> 36:44.453
A fucking spy, Coop?

36:44.454 --> 36:46.330
I figured as much.

36:46.331 --> 36:49.543
Well, go tell him what you saw,
what we talked about.

36:50.127 --> 36:51.545
He can't stop us.

36:52.337 --> 36:54.298
I'm gonna tell him
you were home by curfew.

36:56.008 --> 36:57.134
All of you were.

36:59.011 --> 37:00.219
Why would you do that?

37:00.220 --> 37:02.055
Because I was Juliette's shadow.

37:02.848 --> 37:06.058
It was just us two in the generator room
when everything was going to shit.

37:06.059 --> 37:07.811
We'd be dead if it hadn't been for her.

37:09.730 --> 37:11.481
So I'm not here for Knox.

37:13.483 --> 37:14.943
I'm here for Juliette.

37:15.777 --> 37:17.738
And whatever you guys are doing,
I want in.

37:28.415 --> 37:31.626
Bernard's story about the tape was a lie.

37:31.627 --> 37:33.794
I know that Walker switched the tape
because she sent a--

37:33.795 --> 37:35.214
You don't know shit, girl.

37:39.092 --> 37:42.053
You keep saying stuff like that,
we'll all be sent to the mines.

37:42.054 --> 37:43.972
They've got eyes and ears everywhere.

37:46.642 --> 37:48.017
How did you find us?

37:48.018 --> 37:50.062
I followed this mastermind.

37:51.647 --> 37:54.232
None of you are cut out
for this kind of thing.

37:54.233 --> 37:58.277
You're no good at it. So, quit talking
about the tape and Juliette and all.

37:58.278 --> 38:00.572
It's hazardous for your health.

38:03.659 --> 38:04.742
Are you with us?

38:04.743 --> 38:06.537
What are you aiming to do?

38:07.162 --> 38:08.746
Find people like us.

38:08.747 --> 38:10.623
People who think like us.

38:10.624 --> 38:13.293
Who know they're being lied to,
and wanna know the truth.

38:13.919 --> 38:15.838
When there's enough of you, what then?

38:17.089 --> 38:18.464
We demand answers.

38:18.465 --> 38:22.009
Yeah, you won't get answers.

38:22.010 --> 38:23.302
Then we fight.

38:23.303 --> 38:24.930
They're ready for that.

38:25.514 --> 38:28.851
You've seen all the raiders
and deputies out there.

38:29.476 --> 38:31.561
They're just waiting for one of you
to make the first move.

38:31.562 --> 38:34.313
- They've got all the weapons.
- Well, maybe some of the raiders

38:34.314 --> 38:37.192
and deputies will decide
they wanna know the truth too.

38:38.068 --> 38:39.319
Maybe.

38:41.405 --> 38:44.448
Little while ago, I heard on the radio
there's some new graffiti

38:44.449 --> 38:46.326
growing up all over the Silo.

38:47.494 --> 38:48.871
"JL."

38:50.747 --> 38:51.957
Juliette lives.

38:53.876 --> 38:55.002
Good.

38:55.836 --> 38:57.629
Good, because I think it's true.

38:58.130 --> 38:59.590
I think she's alive.

39:01.049 --> 39:02.551
What do you think, Walk?

39:03.802 --> 39:07.264
Well, with all of you guys dedicated
to finding out the truth, yeah.

39:09.391 --> 39:11.018
She's alive.

39:25.532 --> 39:29.953
For the first time in 25 years,
I don't wanna be drunk.

39:31.622 --> 39:34.750
I wanna be as clear-headed
as I can about this.

39:35.459 --> 39:38.170
And you going forward.

39:40.714 --> 39:42.256
I'll help you, Bernard.

39:42.257 --> 39:43.966
Thank you. I know that together--

39:43.967 --> 39:47.011
First, let me tell you
what you have to do for me.

39:47.012 --> 39:48.680
I'll give you whatever you ask.

39:49.556 --> 39:53.352
Then get me some of the good tape,
and put it aside until the crisis is over.

39:53.977 --> 39:55.061
Why?

39:55.062 --> 39:57.940
I want my freedom.

39:58.774 --> 39:59.899
I don't know what--

39:59.900 --> 40:02.069
You couldn't get me
the wizard's hot-air balloon,

40:03.070 --> 40:07.783
so I want what Juliette Nichols had today.

40:11.203 --> 40:12.663
I want to go out.
