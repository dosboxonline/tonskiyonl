10:58.416 --> 11:01.832
I have a chance to become Auntie Cleo.

11:01.833 --> 11:03.832
Become? What do you me--

11:03.833 --> 11:06.082
Auntie Cleo isn't just a CEO or a person.

11:06.083 --> 11:09.665
She's an idea, handed down
from one generation to the next.

11:09.666 --> 11:12.457
Chairman Courtright says
I could be a perfect Auntie Cleo,

11:12.458 --> 11:14.874
so long as I can figure out
a way to boost our profits.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.374
And it's so simple.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.707
All we have to do is stop testing.

11:18.708 --> 11:20.540
I'm real good at testing products.

11:20.541 --> 11:22.624
It's only slowing down progress.

11:22.625 --> 11:24.665
We should simply let the market decide.

11:24.666 --> 11:27.415
And the sample size
will be our whole customer base.

11:27.416 --> 11:28.790
People are gonna die.

11:28.791 --> 11:30.874
Test subjects die all the time.

11:30.875 --> 11:33.499
Yeah. But it's our job.

11:33.500 --> 11:35.082
This is gonna work.

11:35.083 --> 11:38.874
I just have to keep it from the chairman
until the job is mine.

11:38.875 --> 11:40.416
And then...

11:42.333 --> 11:45.375
I'm going to be Auntie Cleo.

11:46.875 --> 11:49.625
Being Felicity was enough for me.

11:50.708 --> 11:52.208
You can't be serious.

11:53.208 --> 11:55.707
As Felicity, I'm just a cog.
A nobody, like you.

11:55.708 --> 11:59.250
As Auntie Cleo, I'll finally matter.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.540
A little surgery, a few grafts.

12:02.541 --> 12:04.124
But you'll still know it's me.

12:04.125 --> 12:06.040
There'll be so many new products.

12:06.041 --> 12:08.457
"Human-tested."

12:27.833 --> 12:29.165
I'm sorry, Amos.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.708
They're cutting back on the program.

12:31.833 --> 12:35.791
Besides which, you've barely
any human parts left worth poking at.

12:39.625 --> 12:43.333
You were always my favorite test subject,
Amos.

12:44.416 --> 12:47.249
You gave everything you could
to the company.

12:47.250 --> 12:50.207
Well, I suppose that's it, then.

12:50.208 --> 12:51.957
Dr. Langdon,

12:51.958 --> 12:53.582
if somebody here was...

12:53.583 --> 12:56.999
telling lies and hurting people,
that'd be bad, right?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.082
Uh...

12:58.083 --> 13:00.582
Not for something good like testing.
Just...

13:00.583 --> 13:03.915
if they wanted
to hurt real people, like...

13:03.916 --> 13:05.000
customers.

13:06.166 --> 13:09.999
You're asking if assault and fraud
are against corporate policy?

13:10.000 --> 13:12.665
If I had recorded evidence of, um...

13:12.666 --> 13:14.499
c-corporate mal...

13:14.500 --> 13:16.165
- Malfeasance?
- Uh-huh.

13:16.166 --> 13:17.665
- Deceiving the supervisors.
- Well.

13:17.666 --> 13:21.332
That could get somebody
in a great deal of trouble here.

13:21.333 --> 13:24.457
Are you sure
that's something you want to do?

13:24.458 --> 13:27.040

13:53.833 --> 13:55.791
- Amos.

Felicity?

14:00.750 --> 14:01.957
[breathing heavily]

14:01.958 --> 14:04.041
I've been self-centered and ruthless.

14:05.291 --> 14:08.207
I've never stopped
climbing towards the top,

14:08.208 --> 14:10.874
even when I had
to step on people to get there.

14:10.875 --> 14:14.375
I've helped this company destroy lives.

14:15.500 --> 14:18.708
I supervised a testing program
that hurt people.

14:20.375 --> 14:21.958
That hurt you.

14:23.833 --> 14:26.124
The one person I could count on.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.207
Sweet, good,

14:28.208 --> 14:30.041
honest Amos.

14:33.166 --> 14:35.166
You have to tell me the truth.

14:38.791 --> 14:41.166
Are we the bad guys?

14:46.083 --> 14:47.916
Am I a bad person?

14:50.708 --> 14:51.958
You...

14:53.041 --> 14:57.291
You ain't a bad person, Felicity.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.541
I don't want to stop, Amos.

15:01.958 --> 15:04.125
I need this. [sobs quietly]

15:06.541 --> 15:08.041
I know.

15:09.625 --> 15:11.499
Go be Auntie Cleo.
