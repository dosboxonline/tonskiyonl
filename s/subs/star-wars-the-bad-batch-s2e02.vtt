WEBVTT

00:51.375 --> 00:54.541
[Tech] We are descending at a rate
of speed that is most concerning.

00:54.625 --> 00:57.833
Don't worry!
The reentry thrusters should engage soon!

00:57.916 --> 01:00.375
[Echo] If they don't, we're all dead!

01:03.625 --> 01:04.625
[grunts]

01:12.500 --> 01:13.500
Told you.

01:13.583 --> 01:16.750
[Tech] Other than not being able to steer
or control where we land,

01:16.833 --> 01:18.500
I would say this is going well.

01:33.541 --> 01:36.875
The regs have all the entry points
to the castle surrounded.

01:36.958 --> 01:39.375
Not all of them. Our way out is down.

01:39.958 --> 01:42.500
[groans] I knew you were gonna say that.

01:43.791 --> 01:47.416
[Hunter] We use the city ruins for cover
and trek back to the <i>Marauder</i>.

01:48.166 --> 01:50.083
Tech, did you reach the escape pods yet?

01:50.166 --> 01:51.166
[Tech] <i>Not exactly.</i>

01:51.250 --> 01:53.333
<i>We are using an alternate mode</i>
<i>of transport.</i>

01:53.416 --> 01:57.125
<i>My calculations have us crashing towards</i>
<i>the upper forest region of the planet.</i>

01:57.208 --> 01:58.208
Crashing?

02:06.291 --> 02:07.458
[both grunt]

02:14.833 --> 02:17.208
[panting]

02:19.208 --> 02:20.375
[Tech grunts]

02:21.333 --> 02:24.333
That was smoother than some
of Wrecker's attempted landings.

02:24.416 --> 02:26.166
[Hunter] <i>Tech. Report.</i>

02:26.708 --> 02:30.500
We are alive.
But where we are, I am not fully certain.

02:30.583 --> 02:34.458
The Empire's gonna come looking
for their containers, and for us.

02:34.541 --> 02:36.166
[Hunter] <i>Get out of sight and lay low.</i>

02:36.250 --> 02:38.375
<i>Once we get to the </i>Marauder<i>,</i>
<i>we'll come for you.</i>

02:38.458 --> 02:39.458
Roger that.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.583
Uh, what's happening?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.250
[Echo] We haven't fully landed yet.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.000
-Go! Go! Go!
-[Omega grunts]

02:59.458 --> 03:00.583
[shouts]

03:02.416 --> 03:03.708
[grunts]

03:04.791 --> 03:07.291
-[groans]
-Tech! [grunts]

03:07.375 --> 03:09.291
[Tech strains]

03:10.416 --> 03:11.916
[Omega, Echo grunt]

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Are you okay?

03:13.083 --> 03:14.458
[groaning]

03:14.541 --> 03:19.458
My left femur has been fractured by
approximately 150 kilograms of pressure…

03:19.541 --> 03:22.458
[groans] …so… no.

03:23.125 --> 03:24.541
[groaning]

03:24.625 --> 03:26.875
Hang tight.
I'll go up top and scope things out.

03:34.208 --> 03:35.375
[hatch opens]

03:43.166 --> 03:44.875
Oh, great.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.708
[Omega] <i>What do you see out there?</i>

03:46.791 --> 03:48.416
We still haven't landed.

03:53.125 --> 03:54.125
[clone captain] Sitrep.

03:54.208 --> 03:57.250
The containers have scattered
throughout the upper forest region.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.958
Squads have been dispatched,
but it's unlikely the thieves

04:00.041 --> 04:02.916
who infiltrated the cargo ship
survived the crash.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.625
I want confirmation.

04:05.333 --> 04:06.333
Captain Wilco.

04:08.708 --> 04:10.833
The two from the castle must be
in the city.

04:14.208 --> 04:16.375
Redirect our topside forces.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.916
Monitor all comm channels
and bring a shuttle.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Yes, sir.

04:24.541 --> 04:26.500
[Omega grunting]

04:28.708 --> 04:30.250
[inhales, exhales]

04:31.333 --> 04:32.791
-[Echo grunts]
-[Tech groans]

04:36.750 --> 04:39.375
[Tech]
Well, this mission has been eventful.

04:39.458 --> 04:41.125
[Echo] We have to get out of sight.

04:45.375 --> 04:47.875
Wait.
We can't leave without the war chest.

04:47.958 --> 04:49.875
We don't have time.

04:49.958 --> 04:51.958
We need to get away from here
and find cover.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.333
[shuttles approaching]

05:13.416 --> 05:14.416
[Hunter] Get down.

05:25.208 --> 05:27.416
[Wrecker] They're setting up a perimeter.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.125
[scoffs] Like that'll stop us. [chuckles]

05:30.208 --> 05:32.166
[Hunter] They know our forces are split.

05:32.250 --> 05:34.333
They'll monitor comm channels.

05:37.791 --> 05:40.458
[Hunter] <i>Havoc-2.</i>
<i>The fourth sun is setting.</i>

05:40.541 --> 05:42.000
<i>Plan Double Zero.</i>

05:42.083 --> 05:43.291
Copy that.

05:43.375 --> 05:44.541
Plan Double Zero?

05:44.625 --> 05:47.000
[Tech sighs] It means "go radio silent."

05:47.583 --> 05:49.333
Comm channels are being monitored.

05:52.166 --> 05:53.416
We're being followed.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.083
-Don't move.
-I'm not.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.458
Who are you? What are you doing here?

06:03.166 --> 06:05.583
I live here. The name's Romar.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.583
[Echo] He could be working for the Empire.

06:08.666 --> 06:10.333
Me?

06:10.416 --> 06:12.583
Aren't you working for the Empire?

06:12.666 --> 06:15.708
[Tech groans] We do not have time
to debate this.

06:15.791 --> 06:18.166
[Echo]
Where's the nearest place to take shelter?

06:18.791 --> 06:22.750
Well, it's a little hard to think
with her pointing that thing at me.

06:26.291 --> 06:30.625
Much appreciated, but sorry to say
there's no shelter around these parts.

06:30.708 --> 06:34.291
I'm registering a heat source
200 meters west of here.

06:34.375 --> 06:36.833
I suspect it is your domicile.

06:36.916 --> 06:38.916
-How did you do--
-Take us there.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.958
Looks like I don't have much say
in the matter.

06:50.833 --> 06:53.833
Captain, we have eyes on
half of the ejected containers.

06:53.916 --> 06:57.583
No sign of the thieves,
but we did intercept a coded transmission.

06:57.666 --> 07:01.041
Then the ones in the cargo
survived the crash.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.000
Divide the search and recovery squads.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.666
Fifty containers were released.

07:08.750 --> 07:11.125
I want eyes on all 50.

07:11.208 --> 07:12.208
Copy that.

07:13.625 --> 07:16.166
Sir, we have the city perimeter secured.

07:17.125 --> 07:19.208
Commence the radial sweep.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.041
We'll box in these rogues.

07:29.416 --> 07:32.750
[comms chatter]

07:41.875 --> 07:44.125
[Hunter] We're gonna need
to break through their ranks.

07:44.208 --> 07:45.916
How many explosives do you have?

07:46.000 --> 07:48.083
Nothing that'll do any damage.

07:48.166 --> 07:50.041
Just a couple of smoke bombs.

07:51.208 --> 07:52.625
[Hunter] Ten o'clock.

07:54.708 --> 07:59.500
Oh. Old Separatist tanks.
Now you're talking.

08:08.333 --> 08:10.583
[Romar] So, what you're telling me is

08:10.666 --> 08:14.375
that you're rogue clones running
from the Empire's clones,

08:14.958 --> 08:16.541
who used to be the Republic's clones?

08:16.625 --> 08:20.125
[Tech groans] Correct.
You finally got it right. [sighs]

08:20.208 --> 08:22.833
Why is your house
in the middle of nowhere?

08:22.916 --> 08:27.416
Didn't really have a choice
once the Empire showed up, but we make do.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.750
"We"?

08:28.833 --> 08:31.875
The other survivors
who fled the destruction.

08:32.708 --> 08:33.958
Now that Tech is safe,

08:34.041 --> 08:37.041
let's head back to the container and get
as much of the war chest as we can.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.125
No, it's too dangerous.

08:38.208 --> 08:40.791
Troopers could already be
at the crash site.

08:40.875 --> 08:43.041
But we can't leave empty-handed.

08:43.125 --> 08:45.041
We have to complete the mission.

08:46.208 --> 08:49.708
Mm-hmm. Guess you're more like
those other clones than you think.

08:50.458 --> 08:53.375
I'd stay away from that cursed war chest
if I were you.

08:53.458 --> 08:55.000
But we need it.

08:55.083 --> 08:57.333
And it's not cursed, it was stolen.

08:57.416 --> 09:02.833
You think Dooku funded his war effort
by only stealing from outside worlds?

09:02.916 --> 09:03.916
No.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.500
He took from us, his own people.

09:08.083 --> 09:11.666
His quest for power is why
our city is now buried in rubble.

09:11.750 --> 09:16.000
Well, we'll help you get it back.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.208
There's enough in that container
for all of us.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.125
I want none of it.

09:20.625 --> 09:23.916
Let the Empire take it.
The sooner they're gone, the better.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.750
And the same goes for you.

09:26.541 --> 09:27.916
No offense.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.083
[inhales] Now, if you'll excuse me,
some of us have work to do.

09:32.625 --> 09:33.625
[hatch opens]

09:37.000 --> 09:38.958
It's not too late.

09:39.041 --> 09:41.375
We can still scout the site
to see if it's clear.

09:41.458 --> 09:46.041
Negative. Your mission is
to keep an eye on the old man.

09:46.125 --> 09:48.291
[sighs] Roger.

10:09.166 --> 10:10.375
Thanks for the ride.

10:12.208 --> 10:13.458
[console beeps]

10:20.416 --> 10:22.375
[sighs] No good.

10:22.458 --> 10:24.000
How about yours?

10:24.083 --> 10:25.583
This one's down too.

10:37.000 --> 10:38.833
I have a visual on the targets.

10:45.291 --> 10:48.208
[Romar groans, sighs]

10:50.041 --> 10:51.500
You just gonna stand there?

10:53.333 --> 10:55.708
-Oh.
-I'm keeping an eye on you.

10:55.791 --> 10:58.291
Ah. Not much fun, is it?

10:58.791 --> 11:01.458
Uh, here. Try that.

11:02.416 --> 11:03.625
What is it?

11:03.708 --> 11:05.208
[Romar] Look inside.

11:08.833 --> 11:11.958
[gasps] There are jewels in here?

11:12.541 --> 11:15.458
No. No, it's only reflected glass.

11:15.541 --> 11:17.708
It's an optical illusion.

11:17.791 --> 11:20.375
Then it's not treasure?

11:20.458 --> 11:22.375
Oh, for blast's sakes.

11:22.458 --> 11:25.750
It's a toy. It makes you happy.

11:25.833 --> 11:29.208
And believe me,
that is worth more than any jewel.

11:29.291 --> 11:31.458
[Tech] The war chest wasn't ours
in the first place.

11:31.541 --> 11:34.000
[Echo] Well,
we would have made better use of it.

11:34.083 --> 11:37.458
[Tech] I am simply stating that
without the funds from the war chest,

11:37.541 --> 11:39.875
we are no worse off than we were before.

11:39.958 --> 11:41.500
That's not how I see it.

11:42.083 --> 11:45.958
The Empire's growing stronger,
and we're still doing nothing about it.

11:46.625 --> 11:47.833
Where are you going?

11:47.916 --> 11:49.750
To check for patrols.

11:49.833 --> 11:50.916
I'll be back.

11:52.791 --> 11:53.791
[door closes]

11:58.583 --> 11:59.791
Hey, Ace.

11:59.875 --> 12:02.750
Think you can lend me that spanner
on your belt for a minute?

12:03.333 --> 12:06.416
What are you doing
with a model 2 data core?

12:06.500 --> 12:10.250
This here contains a fragment
of my people's history.

12:10.333 --> 12:14.916
Our culture. Art. Music. Memories.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.166
A Separatist archive.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.166
Fascinating.

12:19.250 --> 12:22.250
Not Separatist. Serennian.

12:22.833 --> 12:24.916
We did exist before the war, you know.

12:25.791 --> 12:28.791
I… never thought of it like that.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.250
Now, if I can only get this thing working.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.041
Oh, I can handle that.

12:51.416 --> 12:52.416
There!

12:53.208 --> 12:54.208
That one!

12:54.958 --> 12:57.208
Forget it, Wrecker.
That tank's not going anywhere.

12:57.291 --> 12:58.958
[blasters firing]

12:59.041 --> 13:01.541
Don't need it to. Grab the battery pack.

13:01.625 --> 13:02.750
For what?

13:02.833 --> 13:04.000
Leave it to me.

13:09.250 --> 13:11.625
-Air support's on approach.
-Send them in.

13:12.875 --> 13:14.833

-[beeps]

13:17.666 --> 13:18.666

13:19.416 --> 13:21.416
[grunting] Come to…

13:23.416 --> 13:24.500
Wrecker!

13:28.000 --> 13:29.333
Oh, yeah!

13:31.083 --> 13:33.208
[V-wing approaches]

13:34.708 --> 13:36.375
[Hunter] Pick up the pace.

13:37.416 --> 13:40.000
And we're in business!

13:48.750 --> 13:49.833
[laughs]

13:49.916 --> 13:53.041
Boom! I make a pretty good tank!

13:54.625 --> 13:55.708
[cannon powers up]

13:55.791 --> 13:56.791
Incoming!

13:56.875 --> 13:58.041
Fire in the hole.

[Wrecker laughs]

14:04.791 --> 14:05.791
[groans]

14:08.916 --> 14:10.875
You sure you know what you're doing?

14:11.791 --> 14:12.791
[Tech] There.

14:13.750 --> 14:15.583
Your data has been restored.

14:16.333 --> 14:19.250
You did it. You-- [laughs]

14:19.333 --> 14:21.291
You-- You actually did it.

14:21.375 --> 14:23.166
-Well, of course I did.
-[door opens]

14:27.458 --> 14:28.375
Where's Omega?

14:28.958 --> 14:30.500
She was just here.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.666
Well, she's not now.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.500
Hmm.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.125
My rappelling cable's gone.

14:42.208 --> 14:44.500
I suspect she went after the war chest.

14:44.583 --> 14:47.250
[Echo] We have to find her
before the Empire does.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.416
Go. I will catch up.

14:53.166 --> 14:54.166
[grunts]

-[grunts]
-You won't get very far in your condition.

14:59.458 --> 15:01.291
I can manage.

[grunts]

15:24.125 --> 15:25.500
[blasters firing]

15:25.583 --> 15:27.416
[Hunter] The <i>Marauder</i>
is just over that ridge.

15:27.500 --> 15:30.083
[Wrecker] You said that
about the last one.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.875
This time I mean it.

15:31.958 --> 15:33.666
[groans, shouts]

15:34.625 --> 15:35.750
Look out!

15:37.916 --> 15:39.333
[speeders approaching]

15:44.291 --> 15:46.500
I'm scanning another container dead ahead.

15:46.583 --> 15:47.791
Stay alert.

-Omega!

Look! I packed it full of the shiny stuff!

16:33.125 --> 16:34.875
Did you not hear the blaster fire?

16:34.958 --> 16:36.916
There are troopers out there.
We have to go.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.208
We've located the thieves
and have one pinned.

16:42.291 --> 16:43.625
Requesting backup.

16:43.708 --> 16:47.208
[clone trooper on comm] <i>Copy that.</i>
<i>A gunship is inbound. Hold your position.</i>

16:52.000 --> 16:54.875
[grunting]

16:55.750 --> 16:56.750
[pants]

16:57.416 --> 16:58.416
[grunts]

17:01.083 --> 17:02.000
Look out!

17:08.958 --> 17:12.666
[ship flying over]

17:12.750 --> 17:16.500
Captain Wilco, the intruders are
retreating to the eastern ridge.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.250
Reroute air support.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.333
Yes, sir.

17:26.458 --> 17:27.583
[shouts]

17:31.541 --> 17:35.500
[laughs] This old bird
never looked so good.

17:35.583 --> 17:37.041
We're in position.

17:37.125 --> 17:38.833
[on comm] <i>Tech, send your coordinates.</i>

17:40.666 --> 17:42.541
-[datapad beeping]
-Transmitting.

17:44.916 --> 17:46.791
Coordinates received.
We're heading your way.

17:51.666 --> 17:53.333
We got company.

17:57.875 --> 17:59.458
Get these guys off our tail.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.458
Hold your fire.

18:11.041 --> 18:12.416
[clone trooper grunts]

18:12.500 --> 18:16.666
[both grunting]

18:17.458 --> 18:19.458
[blaster fire]

18:19.541 --> 18:21.250
-[Tech grunts]
-[blaster fire continues]

18:21.875 --> 18:25.083
-[comm beeps]
-CT-3278! Report!

18:26.416 --> 18:27.416
[grunts]

18:28.291 --> 18:29.375
[grunting]

18:31.166 --> 18:32.166
[grunts]

18:33.291 --> 18:34.291
[exhales]

18:40.833 --> 18:41.833
You're almost there.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.750
[grunts, shouts]

18:48.625 --> 18:49.625
[pants]

18:50.250 --> 18:51.916
[gasps] No!

18:52.625 --> 18:54.791
Hurry. This whole ledge is gonna go.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.291
I can get it back.

18:56.375 --> 18:58.250
-I have to.
-Don't.

18:58.333 --> 19:01.125
Omega, forget about the war chest.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.500
It's not important.

19:02.583 --> 19:03.791
Yes, it is.

19:04.416 --> 19:07.041
I heard what you said to Hunter
on the <i>Marauder</i>.

19:07.666 --> 19:10.875
You don't have a normal life
because of me.

19:14.458 --> 19:17.333
Omega, listen to me.

19:17.416 --> 19:18.625
Please.

19:19.250 --> 19:21.875
You have to let it go.

19:34.541 --> 19:35.875
Come on!

19:48.458 --> 19:49.708
Jump.

20:00.708 --> 20:02.208
[footsteps approaching]

20:02.291 --> 20:03.583
Ace?

20:03.666 --> 20:04.958
Ace, wake up.

20:05.041 --> 20:07.750
[grunting]

20:08.458 --> 20:11.208
[exhales] What are you doing here?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.750
[straining]

20:13.833 --> 20:15.875
-I heard blaster fire.
-[grunts]

20:15.958 --> 20:17.750
Thought you might need some help.

20:18.458 --> 20:19.666
And I was right.

20:23.916 --> 20:25.791
[Tech, echoing] Omega! Echo!

20:25.875 --> 20:27.958
-[shuttle approaching]
-Hold on!

20:32.958 --> 20:34.000
I will handle the ship.

20:34.083 --> 20:35.291
I'll grab the cable.

20:40.583 --> 20:41.583
[grunts]

20:44.375 --> 20:45.375
[grunts]

20:47.583 --> 20:49.083
Locking onto the targets.

20:51.916 --> 20:53.583
[echoing] Grab the line!

20:55.666 --> 20:56.958
[speeders approaching]

21:02.208 --> 21:03.250
[shouts]

21:13.625 --> 21:14.625
[gasps, grunts]

21:17.875 --> 21:18.875
[grunts]

21:21.083 --> 21:22.375
[Omega shouts]

21:25.875 --> 21:27.333
All right. Come on.

21:32.583 --> 21:35.958
[grunting]

21:42.833 --> 21:44.708
[Tech] That would be our ride.

21:49.958 --> 21:51.125
Hey, kid.

21:53.208 --> 21:54.541
Keep it.

21:54.625 --> 21:56.416
And remember what I said.

21:58.666 --> 22:01.041
Get going. More will be on the way.

22:01.875 --> 22:02.958
What about you?

22:03.041 --> 22:05.625
I'm a survivor. Remember?

22:34.791 --> 22:38.500
[sighs] I'm sorry we lost the war chest.

22:38.583 --> 22:40.250
We'll manage without it.

22:42.250 --> 22:45.000
I wanted to make things better for us.

22:45.083 --> 22:48.000
I know you all gave up everything
because of me.

22:48.666 --> 22:53.125
Good thing we did, or we might be
fighting for the Empire right now.

22:53.833 --> 22:55.041
Or worse.

22:56.041 --> 22:57.958
We made the right choice, Omega.

22:58.708 --> 23:00.708
I'd do it all again.

23:08.916 --> 23:12.750
As of now,
we've recovered 85% of the war chest,

23:12.833 --> 23:15.166
but I'll chase that number
to perfection, sir.

23:16.125 --> 23:19.833
Your failure to ensure the transfer
of this cargo is not why I am here.

23:20.708 --> 23:24.750
I've come to address some inaccuracies
in your mission report.

23:26.833 --> 23:28.458
What inaccuracies?

23:30.000 --> 23:33.250
You stated the would-be thieves
you encountered were the rogue clones

23:33.333 --> 23:35.583
from experimental unit 99,

23:35.666 --> 23:37.166
yet that is impossible.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.500
Their squad perished
during the fall of Tipoca City.

23:42.916 --> 23:45.541
Your intel was incorrect, sir.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.166
I had visual confirmation on two of them.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.500
They're alive.

23:51.250 --> 23:52.458
I see.

23:53.750 --> 23:57.541
If Governor Tarkin were to learn
of my misstep, then I would be at risk.

23:57.625 --> 23:58.958
And that cannot happen.

23:59.541 --> 24:02.250
Which is why
a new report will be submitted.

24:02.333 --> 24:05.416
One void of any mention of Clone Force 99.

24:10.416 --> 24:15.583
Sir,
I will not falsify an official report.

24:16.625 --> 24:17.625
[Rampart] I understand.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.416
[blaster charges]

24:22.750 --> 24:23.875
I will.

24:25.208 --> 24:26.208
