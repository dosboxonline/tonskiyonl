A FILM BY TOHO

00:27.528 --> 00:31.573
SHIN GODZILLA

00:38.038 --> 00:41.500
We have spotted a pleasure boat drifting

00:41.708 --> 00:42.751
near Haneda.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.336
Very well received.

00:44.753 --> 00:48.632
Pleasure craft confirmed. There appears to be damage to the hull.

00:49.132 --> 00:51.343
Name ... Glory-Maru.

00:51.593 --> 00:55.889
MJG - 15041. Request owner information.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.059
We are on board the ship.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.480
Hello? - Is there anyone here?

01:03.939 --> 01:06.567
There is no one on the upper deck.

01:06.817 --> 01:10.571
No sign of life. Some personal effects ...

01:12.364 --> 01:16.743
No sign of any incident. Perhaps they have fallen into the water.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.914
The boat is empty. Prepare the trailer.

01:33.677 --> 01:36.847
Careful, careful!

01:40.350 --> 01:42.936
First report of Intelligence and Research.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.939
Aqualine has a leak.

01:46.148 --> 01:49.151
Water is falling on the rails.

01:49.359 --> 01:53.488
There is a liaison office prepared and given emergency notice.

01:53.697 --> 01:56.408
- And the Prime Minister? - will arrive in 28 minutes.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.577
... I need information below. - Yes.

02:00.495 --> 02:03.957
First confirmed report was 8:30 in the morning.

02:04.166 --> 02:08.586
Leak in the tunnel Aquafine, about 2.5.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.381
- I want to know how much water comes. - Yes.

02:11.590 --> 02:14.968
It is entering the tunnel. There are several cars affected.

02:15.219 --> 02:17.054
Coast Guard Hamanami

02:17.304 --> 02:19.806
He is caught in the bay in a cloud of steam.

02:20.307 --> 02:22.351
The Aqualine is closed in both directions.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.354
The Coast Guard has already given the warning.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.689
What is the situation, Mr. Koriyama?

02:27.898 --> 02:31.026
5 confirmed collisions inside the tunnel.

02:31.276 --> 02:33.111
Could it be a result of an earthquake?

02:33.362 --> 02:34.905
We're checking right now.

02:35.113 --> 02:37.241
You are having regard to the eruption at sea?

02:37.491 --> 02:39.284
There is not enough information to confirm it.

02:39.535 --> 02:40.911
We have pictures of the helicopter.

02:44.081 --> 02:46.667
A volcanic eruption underwater?

02:47.626 --> 02:49.253
That would be very abnormal.

02:49.461 --> 02:53.465
691 Coast Guard reported. Continuing steam eruptions.

02:53.674 --> 02:57.719
Boiling water prevents visibility under the sea.

02:57.970 --> 03:01.515
We must give a unified initial response.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.183
We have to regroup.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.728
On Catastrophes Unit Please take up all your posts!

03:06.979 --> 03:10.399
Coast Guard Region III has closed the bay.

03:10.607 --> 03:13.110
access either by sea or by earth- are not allowed

03:13.360 --> 03:15.904
It has issued the evacuation order all along the coast.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.491
Please; evacuate the premises immediately.

03:19.700 --> 03:24.496
Follow the instructions of the police and Kisarazu evacuate as soon as possible.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.666
OMG! This is filled with water!

03:27.875 --> 03:29.251
There's a leak! Watch your head!

03:29.501 --> 03:30.377
How cool, a slide!

03:33.380 --> 03:34.756
Please; keep calm.

03:34.965 --> 03:37.718
- How cool site!
- My feet hurt.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.052
Come quickly. Do not stand.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.847
Awesome! I'm recording everything.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.977
- What's that noise?
- Ah¡ up something.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.313
Please; remain seated.

03:49.521 --> 03:53.317
This looks bad.
- It gives me bad vibes. What is that?

03:53.567 --> 03:55.777
- Look, there's something. - it does not look good.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.698
Mr! The Prime Minister has returned.

03:59.948 --> 04:03.035
We can not yet confirm the cause of the rupture of the Aqualine.

04:03.285 --> 04:06.288
I do not care about the details. Are there any fatalities?

04:06.496 --> 04:08.957
- No. Then that address those below.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.502
It is enabled Level 2 alert catastrophe.

04:11.710 --> 04:15.547
I canceled the meeting and come to inform you in 5 minutes.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.089
It is understood.

04:17.341 --> 04:19.384
How likely concerned

04:19.593 --> 04:22.763
an underwater thermal emission and. ' bay floor?

04:22.971 --> 04:25.849
Could it be a nuclear submarine unidentified?

04:26.058 --> 04:30.062
Impossible. Tokyo Bay has no depth for a submarine.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.106
We believe that it could be a vapor emission magma.

04:33.315 --> 04:35.859
A new volcanic eruption under the sea.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.070
Sorry, Minister Yanagihara.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.907
The epicenter is shallow and only steam comes out.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.661
We believe that there is volcanic activity.

04:45.911 --> 04:49.122
- I should have told me before! - Sorry.

04:49.331 --> 04:52.209
Could it be a new large hydrothermal escape?

04:52.417 --> 04:53.544
Yes, that must be it.

04:53.836 --> 04:56.213
A leak directly above the tunnel?

04:56.421 --> 04:59.091
Geological studies rule out that possibility.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.009
Could I having been overlooked?

05:01.260 --> 05:04.972
Prime Minister ... there is something in the bottom of the sea.

05:05.430 --> 05:07.224
What's "something"? Like what?

05:07.432 --> 05:10.811
A colossal creature. There are even pictures on the Internet.

05:11.019 --> 05:15.148
Absurd! A giant whale steaming? The sea is boiling.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.568
What creature has a temperature of over a hundred degrees?

05:17.776 --> 05:20.779
We have been reviewing videos Internet

05:20.988 --> 05:24.116
but we have not yet found any conclusive evidence.

05:24.366 --> 05:28.328
We waste time. And if us a process of elimination?

05:28.579 --> 05:32.749
Good idea. A new thermal volcano or a great escape?

05:32.958 --> 05:34.084
What else could it be?

05:34.293 --> 05:39.590
Then we must develop the action plan as soon as possible.

05:39.840 --> 05:43.343
- We collect the cabinet, sir? - Of course.

05:43.552 --> 05:47.014
Very good. Let's turn to the meeting room.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.981
Yaguchi ...

05:57.316 --> 06:00.652
You'll have to make do with his decision.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.529
Do not complicate things further.

06:02.738 --> 06:05.199
Should not we consider all possibilities?

06:05.449 --> 06:10.370
It's good to be rebellious, but think about the person who brought you here.

06:10.621 --> 06:12.873
You understand? It is my advice.

06:19.254 --> 06:22.716
All the injured are receiving medical attention tunnel.

06:22.841 --> 06:27.346
We have mobilized fire boats and helicopters in Tokyo Bay

06:27.638 --> 06:29.932
and they are prepared to act at any time.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.976
We are in level of preparedness for evacuation

06:33.185 --> 06:36.188
in the coastal region of the bay.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.315
Because of possible rain of debris and ashes,

06:38.565 --> 06:43.445
We have canceled all flights from Haneda airport until further notice.

06:48.492 --> 06:50.160
Excuse me farmhouse I said.

06:51.370 --> 06:55.332
The suspension of all flights of Haneda is inevitable

06:55.541 --> 06:57.835
to ensure the safety of citizens,

06:58.085 --> 06:59.878
apart from economic issues.

07:01.505 --> 07:05.717
As for the flooding of the tunnel caused by an underwater volcano,

07:05.926 --> 07:09.847
fortunately they not detected toxic gases.

07:10.097 --> 07:15.060
Equipment Meteorological Agency and Coast Guard

07:15.352 --> 07:19.481
They are directed to conduct a thorough investigation.

07:24.319 --> 07:28.323
I WILL report that the eruption is decreasing rapidly!

07:35.289 --> 07:38.625
It's over? It was not time for both.

07:38.792 --> 07:42.754
Prime Minister, let me reiterate

07:43.005 --> 07:45.507
the presence of a large sea creature

07:45.716 --> 07:47.009
as a possible cause.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.970
Yaguchi! This is no place for jokes.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.514
This is a ministerial meeting, minutes of everything rises.

07:52.764 --> 07:54.183
Do not take it as a joke!

08:03.358 --> 08:05.736
Not having time to repair,

08:05.986 --> 08:10.616
those losses can be expected to skyrocket in the next ...

08:10.824 --> 08:13.202
I am sorry! We have to adjourn the meeting.

08:13.410 --> 08:16.496
Turning the TV!

08:17.372 --> 08:19.708
Is incredible! This is incredible!

08:20.626 --> 08:23.962
I've never seen anything like it! Something out of the water and is huge!

08:24.171 --> 08:26.924
- On their screens you are seeing ...
 - What's that?

08:27.132 --> 08:29.259
- A tail? - Yes, it's a tail.

08:29.510 --> 08:33.429
Yaguchi joke may end up being very serious.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.808
The meeting adjourned. All ministers

08:37.058 --> 08:39.186
They meet in the office of Prime Minister.

08:44.232 --> 08:46.485
So what the hell is?

08:46.693 --> 08:51.657
We only know it's a way of life giant unidentified.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.409
We are preparing a list of biologists

08:54.618 --> 08:58.080
and experts from universities and research centers.

08:58.330 --> 09:02.876
We will hold an emergency summit to clarify this.

09:03.126 --> 09:05.128
Hurry up. We need answers.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.005
- YES. - Prime Minister,

09:07.214 --> 09:10.884
maybe we should focus on our response.

09:11.343 --> 09:15.138
- Yes of course. - Yes, but this is unprecedented.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.016
I think the options are simple:

09:18.225 --> 09:20.435
let him go, capture and exterminated

09:20.686 --> 09:21.979
or simply chase it away.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.189
I vote for the exterrninación.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.525
I agree.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.402
Look ...

09:28.610 --> 09:32.823
in costs that we have incurred with the tunnel,

09:33.073 --> 09:34.783
the suspension of flights

09:34.992 --> 09:37.703
and the indefinite closure of Tokyo Bay.

09:37.953 --> 09:42.332
- I vote for extermination. - And the sooner the better!

09:42.541 --> 09:44.126
Not so, MoD?

09:47.629 --> 09:50.883
We have prepared other times against threats of wildlife,

09:51.175 --> 09:54.011
but the Japan Self-Defense Forces have never used their weapons

09:54.469 --> 09:55.512
in Tokyo Bay.

09:55.846 --> 09:58.974
And why blow it up? We can not scare him away?

09:59.433 --> 10:02.936
Academic and environmental circles

10:03.145 --> 10:06.440
They are asking that we capture him alive,

10:06.690 --> 10:09.067
Since it is a valuable new species.

10:09.318 --> 10:12.404
No, Extermination is the answer. We will launch a torpedo.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.739
The use of weapons

10:13.989 --> 10:17.534
It requires careful consideration of the options.

10:17.784 --> 10:22.289
I am also strongly in favor of captured alive.

10:22.498 --> 10:26.168
Begin to gather information on unidentified life forms.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.879
Extermination, capture and expulsion.

10:32.925 --> 10:34.676
Excuse me, who is heading?

10:39.932 --> 10:42.601
It is has spotted a cloud of steam near the Tama River!

10:42.809 --> 10:46.146
- How? Does it move? - He's alive, right?

10:47.272 --> 10:50.651
The creature moves away from Haneda airport, runway D

10:50.943 --> 10:53.862
and he is entering the river topic.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.533
We report that the highway is flooding the bay.

10:57.783 --> 11:00.619
- Again! - We can forget to capture it.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.621
Prime Minister, biologists are coming.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.998
There are only three for now, but ...

11:16.176 --> 11:20.180
For television images can not discern whether it is

11:20.389 --> 11:23.725
of an ancient dinosaur or a species of whale.

11:25.394 --> 11:29.147
Seems to be an aquatic species that had not been seen before,

11:30.065 --> 11:32.943
but I can not say so without examined first.

11:34.278 --> 11:38.365
First you have to know if these images are real.

11:39.241 --> 11:42.077
If precipitase me to make a judgment based on untested evidence

11:42.953 --> 11:45.831
I lose my credibility as a biologist.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.170
Please note, the meeting is ending.

11:51.587 --> 11:53.213
This is ridiculous.

12:14.151 --> 12:17.529
- What a waste of time! - I agree.

12:17.738 --> 12:19.072
What a Experts!

12:19.281 --> 12:22.284
- Bring me somebody who knows something. - Yes sir.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.290
Shimura, any ideas?

12:28.499 --> 12:31.835
I have a very competent friend in the Ministry of Environment,

12:32.044 --> 12:34.338
- but it has an important position. - Okay, call it.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.850
Serpentine movement with auxiliary ambulation.

12:47.059 --> 12:49.019
Gills confer water capacity,

12:49.228 --> 12:51.104
but it has legs like an amphibious animal.

12:51.939 --> 12:54.691
If you have legs, you can get on earth?

12:55.526 --> 12:59.446
- Yes, it is a possibility. - Seriously? And so?

12:59.947 --> 13:04.326
Honestly, we have not established which agency should act.

13:04.535 --> 13:07.663
Our expert says that a fin-shaped legs

13:07.913 --> 13:10.749
They would be crushed by the weight of the child,

13:10.999 --> 13:13.877
making up ground is physiologically impossible.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.964
Those legs are already supporting her weight.

13:17.172 --> 13:20.300
Really? What do you think, Minister of Environment?

13:21.718 --> 13:24.930
I apologize for the lack of respect for the vice principal.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.224
But as their experts have concluded,

13:27.474 --> 13:30.060
It is very unlikely to climb ashore.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.437
- I get it. - Prime Minister,

13:32.563 --> 13:35.023
taking into account the damage caused so far,

13:35.649 --> 13:40.779
the sooner we give a press conference to calm the public, the better.

13:41.113 --> 13:44.241
Sir, if I may, I advise you in the press

13:44.491 --> 13:46.994
communicate only verified information.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.787
Let's go there.

13:50.247 --> 13:51.665
Prepare my uniform.

14:12.978 --> 14:17.816
Aqualine tunnels and the Tama River have suffered significant damage.

14:18.442 --> 14:22.654
At present, the creature is going up the river Nomi.

14:22.863 --> 14:25.949
We have not yet identified what kind of creature is,

14:26.283 --> 14:28.452
but we do not expect to rise panics.

14:28.660 --> 14:32.080
If you remain stranded in shallow water,

14:32.331 --> 14:36.752
we believe the creature would die crushed by its own weight.

14:37.085 --> 14:40.881
I repeat, there is no danger that the creature up to the shore.

14:41.089 --> 14:44.343
Please, we ask you to remain calm.

14:44.593 --> 14:47.346
Prime Minister, excuse the interruption.

14:49.431 --> 14:50.933
Have you gone to ground?

14:54.686 --> 14:55.604
¡Socorro!

14:56.396 --> 15:01.026
Run! Please help!

15:01.235 --> 15:03.278
Go Go!

15:03.487 --> 15:06.240
¡No os rushed! ¡Corred!

15:06.823 --> 15:10.285
Whoops! There was no danger of panicking rise, huh?

15:10.494 --> 15:11.870
I've been a liar!

15:12.120 --> 15:13.372
It was to reassure public opinion.

15:13.622 --> 15:17.251
We are asking the experts how it has gone to ground.

15:17.459 --> 15:20.003
Oh, the brood of useless! What's out there?

15:20.254 --> 15:24.091
We do not have enough information yet.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.426
Get it. And hurry.

15:47.823 --> 15:52.119
We must establish a headquarters for crisis management.

15:52.327 --> 15:52.953
It is understood.

15:53.162 --> 15:56.582
this cabinet meeting is suspended.

15:56.832 --> 15:58.250
A work everyone.

16:00.335 --> 16:01.420
How much bureaucracy!

16:01.628 --> 16:04.214
To render any decision needed a meeting.

16:04.423 --> 16:07.885
Do not complain about the bureaucracy, which is the basis of democracy.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.304
How to hold a press conference?

16:10.512 --> 16:13.599
We have established a headquarters

16:13.807 --> 16:15.684
Center! Emergency

16:15.893 --> 16:18.353
to combat lifestyle giant

16:18.562 --> 16:19.688
which he has gone to ground.

16:19.897 --> 16:23.317
We are preparing a large-scale response

16:23.567 --> 16:25.277
to guarantee

16:25.527 --> 16:29.573
safety of citizens, influenced an evacuation of Tokyo

16:29.781 --> 16:32.326
and government agencies ...

16:40.709 --> 16:43.587
The creature goes directly to Shinagawai!

16:43.837 --> 16:46.215
It goes at a speed of about 13 km per hour.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.926
It moves slowly because of its large size.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.762
You can devastate Tokyo in three hours.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.389
The city is very dense and vulnerable.

16:54.598 --> 16:57.267
Prime Minister, could suffer enormous damage.

16:57.476 --> 16:59.186
We have to exterminate it as soon as possible!

16:59.394 --> 17:01.188
It is a highly populated area.

17:01.396 --> 17:03.232
We must evacuate people before.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.358
That emergency services

17:05.567 --> 17:07.986
organize evacuation zones and transport.

17:10.614 --> 17:11.990
We have orders of the Prime Minister

17:12.241 --> 17:14.992
starting the evacuation of the metropolitan area.

17:15.410 --> 17:17.037
Why have so long?

17:17.287 --> 17:21.040
The protocol immediate action is not applicable in this case.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.001
I do not care what the protocol says.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.045
Evacuation plan on the fly.

17:25.295 --> 17:28.131
We've never done the mock evacuation as well.

17:28.382 --> 17:32.344
An evacuation of the entire city would cause general panic.

17:32.594 --> 17:35.681
Citizens have to evacuate on their own.

17:36.056 --> 17:39.059
We will endeavor to control traffic.

17:39.476 --> 17:41.812
Traffic lights do not work.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.314
Please; They leave their vehicles quickly

17:44.523 --> 17:46.358
siganlias indications and police.

17:47.192 --> 17:50.195
Attention citizens. The government in Tokyo

17:50.404 --> 17:52.531
He has ordered the total evacuation of Shinagawa.

17:53.490 --> 17:57.077
All residents must evacuate immediately.

18:17.598 --> 18:19.308
Come on! Run, honey!

18:37.701 --> 18:40.120
At this rate, the city will be in ruins.

18:40.913 --> 18:43.207
Contact the Public Safety Commission.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.502
We can seek the help of Self-Defense Forces

18:46.710 --> 18:48.420
for exterminating pests.

18:48.879 --> 18:50.255
And use weapons?

18:50.464 --> 18:53.133
According to Article 76 could be considered an armed attack

18:53.342 --> 18:55.636
and Self-Defense troops could use force.

18:55.886 --> 18:58.180
This can not be considered an armed attack.

18:58.388 --> 19:01.225
It should be the attack of an aggressor or equivalent country.

19:01.433 --> 19:03.143
But this is no time for semantic dissertations.

19:03.393 --> 19:04.186
We can not do anything.

19:04.436 --> 19:09.066
Only Self-Defense Forces are equipped to respond.

19:09.274 --> 19:12.778
But that means soldiers participating in an urban combat.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.280
That will earn time the Prime Minister.

19:17.324 --> 19:20.911
Prime Minister, we need a plan that includes

19:21.119 --> 19:23.705
the use of military force and the evacuation of citizens.

19:23.914 --> 19:26.166
You have to declare a state of emergency.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.836
Our only measure now

19:29.044 --> 19:31.505
It is the mobilization of troops,

19:31.880 --> 19:34.466
but that can only be done by order of the Prime Minister.

19:35.175 --> 19:39.555
They are talking about an unprecedented statement.

19:39.805 --> 19:43.350
We would be mobilizing the country for war.

19:43.559 --> 19:47.896
The police can not handle an evacuation of this magnitude,

19:48.146 --> 19:49.731
but if we mobilize troops,

19:49.940 --> 19:53.527
there is the possibility of collateral damage.

19:53.735 --> 19:54.945
No, I do not want that.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.739
We could not ask US to kill the beast

19:57.990 --> 19:59.741
welcoming us to the Security Treaty?

19:59.992 --> 20:03.620
No, our government and Self-Defense Forces must act first.

20:03.829 --> 20:07.166
Under the Treaty, USA We can only provide support.

20:07.416 --> 20:09.585
We face a living organism.

20:09.793 --> 20:13.172
If we cause only we get to cause further damage.

20:13.422 --> 20:15.132
Yes, it is a living organism.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.927
And that means we can stop it,

20:19.136 --> 20:21.388
we could not if an earthquake or a typhoon.

20:21.638 --> 20:24.266
Protecting citizens is top priority.

20:24.558 --> 20:29.730
It's a tough decision, sir, but we need your authorization

20:29.980 --> 20:31.690
to prevent further calamities.

20:31.940 --> 20:35.068
At this very moment? Really?

20:35.277 --> 20:37.404
The time is gold. It is in your hands.

20:37.613 --> 20:41.492
A few moments ago, the Prime Minister has decided

20:41.700 --> 20:43.494
declare a state of national emergency,

20:43.911 --> 20:48.749
which it means, for the first time in history,

20:49.374 --> 20:52.753
the mobilization of the Self Defense Forces

20:52.961 --> 20:55.255
and the first military action in Japan

20:55.464 --> 20:58.300
since World War II.

20:58.550 --> 20:59.760
As is the extermination of a pest,

21:00.010 --> 21:01.803
no parliamentary approval is needed.

21:02.012 --> 21:06.016
The metropolitan government has mobilized Division Nerima wing.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.852
They guide the evacuation, but are not equipped for combat.

21:09.269 --> 21:12.439
Assault helicopters are the fastest.

21:12.689 --> 21:14.233
Contact base Kisarazu.

21:14.483 --> 21:17.319
- We deploy the F-2 Misawa? - Do not.

21:17.569 --> 21:20.572
Any civilian casualty Self-Defense Forces would hurt forever.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.407
It is necessary to minimize the use of weapons.

21:22.658 --> 21:27.371
But we do not know his strength. I think we should be prepared.

21:27.621 --> 21:28.455
I agree.

21:28.956 --> 21:32.292
We recommend an integrated operation of the three forces.

21:32.793 --> 21:34.086
Call the Prime Minister.

21:35.337 --> 21:38.966
The joint force will be led by the Eastern Army.

21:39.216 --> 21:40.926
The goal is the extermination of the creature.

21:41.176 --> 21:44.930
If ground troops focus only on the evacuation,

21:45.180 --> 21:49.184
The helicopters will be the main strike force.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.395
Lord, because it is the city,

21:51.603 --> 21:54.523
some elderly and sick should stay here.

21:54.731 --> 21:57.985
So I can not make a decision without an inspection.

21:58.235 --> 22:03.073
In cases like this there will inevitably be some collateral damage.

22:03.574 --> 22:07.161
Lord, I know it is not easy,

22:07.870 --> 22:09.621
but we need a decision.

22:11.623 --> 22:12.332
It is understood.

22:16.628 --> 22:20.883
It is a very risky mission. Do I ask for volunteers?

22:21.091 --> 22:22.885
No, the standard rotation.

22:23.093 --> 22:25.137
We get ready for that.

22:28.098 --> 22:30.100
Kisarazu took off at 13:08.

22:30.309 --> 22:32.519
Estimated arrival time 13:20. Change.

22:37.733 --> 22:39.401
What a relief!

22:39.610 --> 22:43.447
That creature will be great, but this should suffice.

22:43.655 --> 22:47.576
Maybe we can rebuild the city with his body.

22:47.993 --> 22:50.245
Ministro Yanagihara,

22:50.496 --> 22:53.123
the delusions and theories of office

22:53.373 --> 22:55.834
the old Imperial Army during the last war

22:56.043 --> 22:58.212
They caused the loss of three million lives.

22:58.462 --> 23:00.506
Beware the unfounded optimism.

23:15.020 --> 23:17.147
Beware the steps. Keep calm.

23:17.356 --> 23:19.816
Get out of here right away.

23:20.067 --> 23:22.569
Local evacuation centers are useless.

23:22.819 --> 23:25.239
Tell us where to send people!

23:48.178 --> 23:51.557
The creature has stopped!

23:51.932 --> 23:54.393
Have you stopped? Why suddenly?

24:25.465 --> 24:26.800
Amazing.

24:29.094 --> 24:30.179
It is evolving.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.940
Attack 1, here Control Center. Change.

25:23.190 --> 25:24.858
Control Center here Attack 1. Change.

25:25.108 --> 25:28.070
Dirínjanse to the containment zone 2 and wait for orders.

25:28.278 --> 25:29.738
Attack 1, received.

25:38.455 --> 25:39.957
It is not what we had been told.

25:40.207 --> 25:41.416
Here Offense 1.

25:41.708 --> 25:44.670
The objective differs from the report.

25:45.420 --> 25:50.133
Attack 1, hold position and await further instructions.

25:50.384 --> 25:53.136
Complete evacuation of residents.

25:53.387 --> 25:57.307
It is understood. Minister, we are ready to open fire.

25:57.558 --> 25:58.225
It is understood.

25:59.101 --> 26:02.437
Lord, we are ready. when you say.

26:03.522 --> 26:06.149
It's okay. Ahead.

26:06.358 --> 26:10.070
Attack 1, open fire.

26:10.279 --> 26:13.657
I repeat, open fire.

26:13.907 --> 26:16.285
Received Control Center. Opening fire.

26:16.869 --> 26:19.830
The objective is opposite. Aim for the head.

26:20.038 --> 26:24.334
Distance, 300 meters. Prepared. Stop the fire!

26:36.471 --> 26:37.723
Why do not you shoot?

26:37.931 --> 26:40.601
No civilians near the firing line.

26:41.810 --> 26:43.478
There are civilians present. Can we shoot?

26:43.687 --> 26:45.606
There are civilians present. Can we shoot?

26:45.814 --> 26:47.482
There are civilians present. Can we shoot?

26:48.483 --> 26:51.862
There are civilians. Can we proceed with the shooting?

26:52.070 --> 26:54.072
Prime Minister, we have to abort.

26:55.574 --> 26:56.700
Stop the attack!

26:57.659 --> 27:01.205
He is right. Abort the attack, right now.

27:01.538 --> 27:03.040
Civilians can not be injured.

27:03.332 --> 27:04.500
Attack 1, paid the attack.

27:04.750 --> 27:07.002
Back to waiting positions. Change.

27:07.211 --> 27:09.421
Received. We abort! Keeping positions!

27:27.147 --> 27:29.191
The creature moves again!

27:29.816 --> 27:33.737
Be opens the way down the highway! It's heading to Tokyo Bay!

27:48.210 --> 27:49.837
They have canceled all flights.

27:50.045 --> 27:52.756
A new fire in Shinagawa.

27:53.006 --> 27:54.967
Most trains operate.

27:55.175 --> 27:58.804
We send support from abroad ...

27:59.012 --> 28:00.514
... with more supplies and support staff.

28:00.681 --> 28:03.725
The Tokyo Stock Exchange works again.

28:03.976 --> 28:08.230
The bullet train operates its usual route between Yokohama and Shin ...

28:08.438 --> 28:13.902
They have legacy scientists from France and other nations.

28:14.152 --> 28:16.864
has not been sighted the creature in the Uraga Channel,

28:17.072 --> 28:19.116
so the search area expands.

28:19.324 --> 28:22.870
The number of fatalities has risen to one hundred.

28:23.120 --> 28:26.081
Ola fires are extinguished.

28:26.331 --> 28:29.751
Minister of Disaster Management Kanai

28:30.002 --> 28:33.672
leading a delegation to monitor and assess damage.

28:38.427 --> 28:41.847
He was alone on the land about two hours ...

28:42.055 --> 28:45.058
- ... and look what he did. - Do not.

28:46.351 --> 28:51.064
We had two hours to assemble an initial response. Disappointing.

28:51.273 --> 28:53.567
It was all by surprise. He could not be avoided.

28:55.194 --> 28:58.155
Everyone did what they could under the circumstances.

28:58.947 --> 29:00.574
Not to boast, Yaguchi.

29:00.824 --> 29:05.204
It's time to meet the press, Mr. Minister. Here.

29:05.412 --> 29:06.914
It's okay.

29:47.704 --> 29:52.167
We believe that is in the sea near Kanaya.

29:52.376 --> 29:55.504
We are increasing surveillance and patrols

29:55.796 --> 29:58.048
by Chiba and Sagami Bay.

29:58.257 --> 30:02.469
But if it is hidden in the Sagami channel will be impossible to detect.

30:02.678 --> 30:05.973
Who knows when or where reappear?

30:06.807 --> 30:08.767
How are the preparations?

30:11.103 --> 30:13.814
Once spotted the creature, a ground attack

30:14.022 --> 30:15.691
by the water, it will be difficult.

30:15.899 --> 30:18.360
Plans need ...

30:18.610 --> 30:21.864
to locate a point of landing and patrol persecution.

30:22.364 --> 30:23.782
I'll get on it.

30:23.991 --> 30:27.911
We anticipate attacks with artillery, tanks and F2.

30:28.162 --> 30:32.666
Defensive maneuvers are focusing on the Kanto area.

30:32.875 --> 30:35.252
The metropolitan area has priority.

30:35.419 --> 30:37.713
It seems that the order comes from the fifth floor.

30:38.297 --> 30:40.549
And what about the regions?

30:40.799 --> 30:44.720
13 million people, a GDP of 85 trillion yen ...

30:44.970 --> 30:47.347
It is 17% of the total.

30:47.598 --> 30:51.810
And the Kanto region accounts for 40% and 200 trillion.

30:52.060 --> 30:55.939
It seems a prudent strategy.

30:57.107 --> 30:58.859
Protecting a country is not easy.

30:59.109 --> 31:01.278
They have assigned a rapid response team

31:01.486 --> 31:03.405
the residence of the Prime Minister.

31:03.614 --> 31:06.617
And I have been told that you have appointed

31:06.825 --> 31:09.620
its chief operating officer. I see you progress.

31:09.828 --> 31:14.041
You want to choose the team. You know the bureaucrats.

31:14.291 --> 31:17.836
I look for people who are not afraid to tell the truth.

31:18.045 --> 31:20.088
If people with guts.

31:20.339 --> 31:22.299
- Soy Tachikawa.
- Takeo.

31:22.549 --> 31:23.926
Ready? Above.

31:37.231 --> 31:38.857
Soy Rando Yaguchi.

31:39.066 --> 31:42.236
It will function as a flat organization.

31:42.486 --> 31:46.365
No titles or seniority. All speak freely.

31:46.615 --> 31:50.744
So is. Officially, I'm in charge, but we're an elite team

31:50.994 --> 31:54.623
composed of lone wolves, nerds, liantes, marginalized,

31:54.832 --> 31:57.751
heretics and enemies of the academic bureaucracy.

31:58.001 --> 32:01.129
Every man for himself. These are the basic specifications.

32:01.380 --> 32:02.965
Find out what you can.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.181
- This is all? - So is.

32:11.431 --> 32:15.936
We fill in what is missing. If you have information, share it.

32:16.144 --> 32:18.105
The "expert advice" yesterday ...

32:18.355 --> 32:21.984
He could not reach any conclusion.

32:22.192 --> 32:24.152
I have prepared a simple profile.

32:24.486 --> 32:26.905
We have seen three different configurations.

32:27.114 --> 32:29.533
But they come more mutations. - There is more?

32:30.868 --> 32:34.621
We are analyzing a sample of body fluid.

32:34.872 --> 32:37.624
Give me a little. I'll help out.

32:37.875 --> 32:41.086
USA It has taken all the samples we had left.

32:41.295 --> 32:44.673
The remains of the creature they burn off the stench.

32:44.923 --> 32:48.010
Under pressure from the Americans, they tell me.

32:48.218 --> 32:50.304
We allow ourselves the analysis to you.

32:50.512 --> 32:52.806
And what do we know about its biology behavior?

32:53.056 --> 32:55.100
It seems that simply moves.

32:55.309 --> 32:57.686
We can not confirm it smart.

32:57.936 --> 33:01.315
I think he's communicating with something very improbable.

33:01.565 --> 33:05.068
A very simple question. What is your source of energy?

33:05.319 --> 33:09.573
You need an enormous amount of energy, not only to move,

33:09.781 --> 33:11.241
but at the metabolic level.

33:11.742 --> 33:15.787
With the conversion of oxygen in your digestive tract is not sufficient.

33:15.996 --> 33:17.956
All that energy ...

33:21.126 --> 33:22.586
Nuclear fision?

33:24.630 --> 33:26.798
It has a great sense of humor, Ms. Ogashira.

33:27.799 --> 33:28.967
That's impossible.

33:32.221 --> 33:33.722
An American aircraft carrier leaves the port?

33:34.181 --> 33:37.684
We have learned that the alert has jumped radiation

33:37.935 --> 33:39.520
in the city of Yokosuka.

33:39.728 --> 33:42.606
I'll call the Nuclear Regulatory Agency.

33:42.856 --> 33:45.692
I have orders not to go public yet,

33:45.943 --> 33:49.154
but radiation levels in the metropolitan area have risen.

33:49.404 --> 33:52.533
Is there a leak? A reactor?

33:52.950 --> 33:57.371
We have not found any reactor leaks in the country.

33:57.579 --> 33:59.122
And then, where does it come?

34:04.586 --> 34:06.797
Could it be possible!

34:09.925 --> 34:12.511
These data show that the radiation peaks

34:12.719 --> 34:14.263
match the path it has traveled the creature.

34:17.306 --> 34:18.516
Look at this.

34:20.143 --> 34:21.018
¿Lo ve?

34:24.731 --> 34:29.527
-. Ms. Ogashira was right. - Sorry.

34:39.746 --> 34:42.373
The information is reaching the public.

34:42.583 --> 34:45.835
Contact the Secretary of the Cabinet.

34:48.589 --> 34:50.132
This is a problem.

34:50.382 --> 34:53.342
The Prime Minister should convene a press conference.

34:53.552 --> 34:58.182
No evidence that this creature is radioactive,

34:58.515 --> 35:00.017
We could stoke public fear.

35:00.309 --> 35:03.437
These levels are not sufficient for evacuation.

35:03.687 --> 35:06.064
There is no legal basis for approval.

35:06.356 --> 35:09.484
But still it remains a matter of radioactivity.

35:09.735 --> 35:13.947
- The sooner the better. - You're right. I'll talk to the press.

35:14.156 --> 35:16.200
Let me talk to the Prime Minister.

35:17.284 --> 35:20.787
Convene a press conference in five minutes.

35:21.038 --> 35:25.292
Yes, President Ross, I understand. Thank you.

35:28.921 --> 35:31.423
There are many unilateral demands.

35:33.675 --> 35:35.093
Typical Americans.

35:35.302 --> 35:37.429
An aide to US President

35:37.679 --> 35:41.099
She wants a secret meeting with the Prime Minister.

35:41.350 --> 35:43.268
They move fast.

35:43.685 --> 35:46.855
Just leave Yokota Air Base.

35:47.064 --> 35:49.775
Foreign Minister is furious.

35:49.983 --> 35:57.032
- I think his assistant wants to see you. - To me? For what?

35:57.699 --> 36:00.285
I read the reports of his administration.

36:00.536 --> 36:03.163
I need a person with whom you can work.

36:03.413 --> 36:06.083
With an interesting history. And that's you.

36:06.542 --> 36:07.376
It is an honor,

36:07.960 --> 36:10.963
but I think it refers to the adviser to the Prime Minister, Akasaka.

36:11.964 --> 36:14.007
Can I refuse entry?

36:14.216 --> 36:17.052
I need a favor not spill my record.

36:18.554 --> 36:20.222
I want you to meet someone.

36:21.974 --> 36:23.225
And who is it?

36:24.601 --> 36:29.022
A man who predicted the appearance of her child several years ago.

36:29.606 --> 36:34.194
Are you interested? He landed in Narita seven days ago.

36:34.653 --> 36:35.779
Goro Maki.

36:36.321 --> 36:39.158
Japanese. Former professor of college.

36:39.408 --> 36:43.078
Its intelligence agency is the best.

36:43.412 --> 36:44.746
And what we get along?

36:48.208 --> 36:52.004
An exchange. We have gathered information that might interest them.

36:52.296 --> 36:55.257
But it must be bilateral, okay?

36:55.507 --> 36:58.552
Only the United States and Japan. So, we all win.

36:58.760 --> 37:03.390
It is understood. To work. - Thank you.

37:03.599 --> 37:05.767
I have run out of a party,

37:05.976 --> 37:09.980
I have not had time to change. Is there a Zara here?

37:10.189 --> 37:14.193
Kayoco Anne Patterson. It's very young.

37:14.401 --> 37:17.321
In U.S.A. performance is valued over age.

37:17.571 --> 37:19.907
And she is the daughter of Senator Patterson.

37:20.115 --> 37:24.286
Kern responsible for the Agreement. Is awesome.

37:24.495 --> 37:27.998
A mixture of talent, pedign 'and beauty.

37:28.999 --> 37:32.669
- I suspect it will not be his type. - Do not.

37:33.754 --> 37:37.341
If you use the contacts of his father brazenly ...

37:37.549 --> 37:40.719
Is the typical politics as Yaguchi.

37:43.847 --> 37:45.849
Looking for a person at a time?

37:46.099 --> 37:47.935
Es para Rando Yaguchi.

37:48.435 --> 37:53.607
I owe a lot to his father. Give all players need.

37:54.274 --> 37:56.109
This is your profile.

37:58.654 --> 38:02.825
An elderly rebel teacher, sent off on his day Japan.

38:03.325 --> 38:07.204
Although it is a biologist, he worked at a US nuclear company

38:07.454 --> 38:08.664
An interesting old.

38:09.081 --> 38:13.377
- Do we have to stop? - No, just locate him.

38:13.627 --> 38:16.880
The NSA or the CIA will do the rest.

38:17.923 --> 38:19.633
Discreetly, I am told.

38:20.050 --> 38:21.844
His last whereabouts.

38:22.094 --> 38:24.930
How quickly does the country of my grandmother!

38:25.180 --> 38:26.932
But it has vanished.

38:27.182 --> 38:30.978
The Coast Guard found the boat adrift at sea.

38:32.396 --> 38:33.981
Ms. Patterson ...

38:35.232 --> 38:38.443
Were you looking teacher or sought this?

38:38.819 --> 38:40.070
Yes, that too.

38:40.904 --> 38:43.490
"I did what I felt like. You do the same. "

38:44.616 --> 38:45.742
Do your last words?

38:47.536 --> 38:50.289
- You want to confirm the contents? - Needless.

38:50.956 --> 38:52.249
I trust you.

38:52.499 --> 38:54.793
It is a special ink. You can not be copied.

38:55.002 --> 38:57.421
I will take photos to share with my team.

39:00.757 --> 39:02.676
¿Godzilla?

39:03.844 --> 39:08.348
So is. It is a codename Department of Energy. Godzilla.

39:08.682 --> 39:10.100
I got an English name.

39:11.768 --> 39:14.354
Gojira ... What does it mean?

39:15.647 --> 39:17.524
I found something.

39:18.192 --> 39:20.027
On the island of Ohdo, where he is the teacher,

39:20.569 --> 39:22.779
means "incarnation of God".

39:23.030 --> 39:27.034
And very violent. That's why I put him "God" in the name.

39:28.243 --> 39:31.330
In Japanese, what you read is Gojira.

39:31.747 --> 39:35.209
Gojira. What is that?

39:35.459 --> 39:39.171
What else gives its name to this point?

39:39.421 --> 39:42.758
It does not matter that originates in the United States.

39:42.966 --> 39:45.719
At least now we know what to call it.

39:46.053 --> 39:51.016
The government has decided to use the unofficial name of Godzilla

39:51.225 --> 39:53.810
referring to the giant creature.

39:55.103 --> 40:00.025
Goro Maki, former professor of biology at the University of Jonan.

40:01.735 --> 40:03.779
Find out who he was.

40:04.571 --> 40:07.449
When the time comes we will give exclusive

40:08.367 --> 40:09.827
to publish history.

40:10.494 --> 40:15.040
- I promise, Hayafune. Yes, I know.

40:20.420 --> 40:22.130
This is 60 years ago.

40:22.506 --> 40:26.510
They are non-regulation discharges of radioactive material.

40:32.099 --> 40:33.141
Can not be...

40:33.851 --> 40:37.229
- Gojira ate such discharges. - Yes.

40:37.604 --> 40:39.523
It is the conclusion of the Department of Energy.

40:40.440 --> 40:43.944
They sent requests to several institutions ...

40:44.153 --> 40:45.445
to analyze the containers.

40:45.696 --> 40:47.614
Dr. Maki was the main figure.

40:48.115 --> 40:51.618
Suddenly, an ancestral species of marine life

40:51.869 --> 40:54.580
I was surrounded by radioactive discharges

40:55.122 --> 41:00.252
and quickly he mutated into an organism that could withstand radiation.

41:01.128 --> 41:04.173
That's the theory of Godzilla. - But his body grew

41:04.381 --> 41:06.800
when he left the sea.

41:07.050 --> 41:11.138
You can suddenly mutate marine to terrestrial organism.

41:11.555 --> 41:15.017
This new Godzilla beyond anything I could imagine.

41:15.684 --> 41:17.978
That's all the information I have.

41:19.188 --> 41:20.606
And what comes now ...

41:21.190 --> 41:23.233
My personal assistant.

41:31.116 --> 41:32.951
Is what Dr. Maki was left?

41:35.621 --> 41:37.748
I do not understand anything.

41:38.916 --> 41:42.920
There is a molecular structure. What relationship will have with Godzilla?

41:43.128 --> 41:46.882
It could be an analytical table of the structural layers.

41:47.257 --> 41:51.094
Dr. Maki left out deliberately final data.

41:51.303 --> 41:53.514
But now we have the full version.

41:54.264 --> 41:55.766
Would you care to analyze it?

41:56.016 --> 41:57.935
- Can we take pictures? - Clear.

42:02.856 --> 42:07.194
It gives me fatal Japanese protocol. Can we be more infonnales?

42:08.111 --> 42:08.987
Well tell me.

42:10.405 --> 42:14.535
What do you do USA with Godzilla? I study him or exterminate?

42:14.993 --> 42:17.454
That is up to the President.

42:19.665 --> 42:21.500
Who decides in your country?

42:26.755 --> 42:30.008
Finally, a decision on relief and recovery law.

42:30.217 --> 42:33.387
Collaboration between agencies will be difficult to Godzilla Law.

42:33.637 --> 42:36.098
The lack of precedent slow orders.

42:36.306 --> 42:39.184
Everyone will try to pass the ball.

42:39.434 --> 42:42.187
At least Security Act was easily approved.

42:42.396 --> 42:44.898
Foreign imposed under US pressure

42:45.107 --> 42:48.277
USA He wants to use his information on Godzilla

42:48.485 --> 42:49.987
as a diplomatic card.

42:50.195 --> 42:53.657
Aide Akasaka pray that knows how to handle the White House.

42:53.907 --> 42:56.743
They are the analysis of the place dela catastrophe.

42:56.952 --> 43:00.038
Gamma rays do not match any known element.

43:00.289 --> 43:02.833
Is incredible! Godzilla is, right?

43:03.083 --> 43:06.170
His body has led to new elements.

43:07.379 --> 43:11.800
Why the US Department of Energy He has acted so quickly.

43:12.718 --> 43:14.052
We get this data.

43:14.303 --> 43:15.804
Prime Minister calls.

43:16.263 --> 43:20.184
It is understood. More problems and complications.

43:21.268 --> 43:24.855
So how much have you?

43:25.063 --> 43:28.192
We have analyzed the substances listed

43:28.400 --> 43:30.152
in the track left Godzilla

43:30.444 --> 43:34.281
there is a 0.5 microsieverts radiation in the affected area.

43:34.531 --> 43:37.993
Thanks for the food. - Yes thanks.

43:38.202 --> 43:41.538
Even with the information that has happened USA,

43:41.747 --> 43:43.457
I sense that we're going to get stuck.

43:43.624 --> 43:45.918
If the Riken report has had its impact.

43:46.126 --> 43:49.505
Godzilla has 8 times more genetic information than humans.

43:49.713 --> 43:52.716
It takes years to sequence it.

43:52.925 --> 43:56.803
Godzilla is the most evolved creature on the planet.

43:57.054 --> 44:00.807
Capable of self-mutilation and regenerate.

44:01.433 --> 44:03.310
That surpasses human intelligence.

44:03.519 --> 44:06.855
But still deadly. You may be kill.

44:07.105 --> 44:08.232
I hope so.

44:08.732 --> 44:11.985
It's what we have to find out:

44:12.194 --> 44:14.530
¿Possible causes of this behavior?

44:14.738 --> 44:16.073
Just walk.

44:16.323 --> 44:19.952
Why is there suddenly decided to return to Tokyo Bay?

44:23.455 --> 44:26.416
I have it. To cool down.

44:28.043 --> 44:32.714
Gojira has a kind of nuclear reactor built.

44:33.131 --> 44:35.259
Their fins are vents.

44:35.509 --> 44:37.511
The mixture is cooled based blood.

44:37.761 --> 44:40.597
It has become temporarily marine creature

44:40.848 --> 44:43.934
to adjust its body temperature after mutate.

44:44.142 --> 44:45.602
Perhaps our only hope

44:45.811 --> 44:48.897
passes off its internal cooling system.

44:49.147 --> 44:53.193
And that would force him to restart the reactor to stay alive.

44:53.402 --> 44:58.073
Rapid cooling may not come to kill, but to immobilize.

44:58.323 --> 45:01.702
Would administer a drug such as blood clotting.

45:01.952 --> 45:03.954
And that is possible if you are standing?

45:04.204 --> 45:06.540
We examine what methods to implement.

45:06.748 --> 45:09.334
Perhaps a compression pump.

45:09.543 --> 45:12.379
We, the Ministry of Health and Economy

45:12.629 --> 45:15.257
We meet the coagulant and the necessary equipment.

45:15.507 --> 45:18.343
Introduce him to the Prime Minister as the Plan Yaguchi.

45:18.552 --> 45:19.469
It is understood.

45:21.597 --> 45:23.557
Names aside, to work.

45:25.142 --> 45:27.102
Godzilla is God!

45:27.561 --> 45:29.521
¡Salvad a Godzilla!

45:31.440 --> 45:34.443
Godzilla is God! Salvad Godzilla!

45:59.510 --> 46:03.347
Good Morning. A tea? Thank you very much.

46:03.722 --> 46:05.766
Thank you very much.

46:07.518 --> 46:09.770
Listen. We could use a break.

46:09.978 --> 46:11.355
Very good.

46:19.530 --> 46:22.825
Everyone is working voluntarily.

46:23.033 --> 46:26.495
They go home to rest, even when asked.

46:26.745 --> 46:31.458
0 return early the next day with hot food for everyone.

46:33.001 --> 46:34.503
It is an inspiration.

46:34.753 --> 46:38.549
No trace of all these struggles between ministries.

46:38.841 --> 46:41.343
Only people working together.

46:41.593 --> 46:42.928
And there are many people outside

46:43.303 --> 46:46.223
who has also devoted his time tirelessly.

46:47.057 --> 46:48.267
You are right.

46:49.852 --> 46:53.480
There is still hope for this country, really.

46:53.939 --> 46:58.485
But I have a question, when you change your shirt?

47:00.070 --> 47:02.948
The truth is that it smells a little bad.

47:05.242 --> 47:06.118
For real?

47:06.702 --> 47:09.079
You could use a good shower good.

47:15.335 --> 47:18.213
Godzilla has appeared in Sagami Bay!

47:18.505 --> 47:19.840
And it is up to the ground.

47:36.982 --> 47:40.611
Red alert! They tell us that Godzilla has gone to ground!

47:40.861 --> 47:44.114
Conveying red alert for the entire national network!

47:44.364 --> 47:48.494
He speaks the Disaster Prevention Unit of Kamakura.

47:50.245 --> 47:53.207
This is an emergency evacuation order.

47:53.832 --> 47:57.878
An unidentified creature colossal size has gone to ground.

47:58.086 --> 48:02.299
We urge all residents to evacuate the city immediately.

48:02.549 --> 48:05.052
I repeat, evacuate immediately.

48:05.886 --> 48:11.892
Please follow the instructions of the police and the fire department.

48:12.100 --> 48:13.769
The first Minister!

48:47.803 --> 48:50.931
Godzilla Kamariya directly advance.

48:51.223 --> 48:54.226
Have I gone mad or is bigger?

48:54.476 --> 48:56.520
Much more than we could expect.

48:56.728 --> 48:58.647
He has changed the face and body.

48:58.856 --> 49:01.233
Yes, it has doubled in size.

49:02.568 --> 49:04.945
It has evolved to its fourth state.

49:09.575 --> 49:11.827
This will be a catastrophe.

49:21.753 --> 49:25.382
Attention citizens! Take refuge inside their homes!

49:25.632 --> 49:29.386
This area is under curfew!

49:29.595 --> 49:33.891
They are located in a designated evacuation area!

49:34.141 --> 49:37.227
Attention citizens!

49:54.036 --> 49:57.289
Godzilla is expected to reach Tokyo in about three hours.

49:57.539 --> 49:59.583
Why return here again?

50:22.231 --> 50:24.733
With a direct attack on his body

50:25.567 --> 50:28.570
We run the risk of releasing radioactive material.

50:29.112 --> 50:33.367
Prevent progress towards the metropolitan area is the highest priority.

50:34.117 --> 50:36.995
It seems to live the radioactive material.

50:37.246 --> 50:41.917
If attacked a nuclear plant, it would be an even greater catastrophe.

50:42.209 --> 50:46.964
Prime Minister, we have to stop now.

50:47.214 --> 50:51.343
Should not think that abroad we are afraid.

50:51.718 --> 50:53.887
How's your Yaguchi Plan?

50:54.096 --> 50:56.098
Unfortunately, it is not finished.

51:31.216 --> 51:33.260
We will use Plan B if it appears in Kanagawa.

51:33.468 --> 51:37.890
Kawasaki will be the main battlefield.

51:38.182 --> 51:41.518

52:15.511 --> 52:18.096
The target contains radioactive material.

52:18.388 --> 52:21.725
Concentrate your shots to the head and legs.

The goal turns to the northwest! Repeat going northwest!

57:31.827 --> 57:34.538

59:03.669 --> 59:07.923
Line defense has fallen.

59:10.801 --> 59:15.180
Still within reach of our artillery.

59:16.056 --> 59:17.015
We must continue!

59:17.349 --> 59:20.936
Do not! Those districts have not been evacuated completely.

59:22.062 --> 59:24.189
I'm afraid that's all we can do

59:24.648 --> 59:26.191
It is understood.

59:27.693 --> 59:29.236
the operation is suspended.

59:29.653 --> 59:32.322
I am sorry. We could not even stop it.

59:32.531 --> 59:35.909
Do not lose hope. Our mission is to protect people.

59:36.118 --> 59:40.247
The offensive is not the only solution. Accelerates evacuations.

59:40.706 --> 59:43.542
The operation has failed. Gojira moves again.

59:43.750 --> 59:46.211
Self-Defense entire arsenal has been useless.

59:46.420 --> 59:49.047
It has a capacity of incredible survival.

59:49.298 --> 59:52.676
If conventional weapons worked, we would not be here.

59:52.885 --> 59:55.387
A perfect body than man.

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:05.564
The target enters the Meguro district!

01:00:05.981 --> 01:00:10.527
We must ask for help from US to destroy him.

01:00:10.777 --> 01:00:12.654
Lord, the US ambassador confirms

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:16.033
that their bombers are on their way.

01:00:20.329 --> 01:00:22.706
Present an official request for cooperation.

01:00:22.956 --> 01:00:24.416
I will meet with the ambassador.

01:00:24.666 --> 01:00:27.961
I will give a press conference to explain the issue.

01:00:28.170 --> 01:00:31.715
We have requested assistance from the US Air Force. based in Japan

01:00:31.965 --> 01:00:35.010
to fight Godzilla under the Security Treaty between the two.

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:54.029
This is the area bombing proposed.

01:00:54.530 --> 01:00:58.158
A big area? That would cause more harm than Godzilla.

01:00:58.408 --> 01:01:01.954
Wing evacuate people dugouts.

01:01:02.162 --> 01:01:05.082
USA. He will launch an attack on Godzilla.

01:01:05.332 --> 01:01:09.002
Evacuate subway stations and underground galleries.

01:01:19.263 --> 01:01:20.264
Do not push!

01:01:46.123 --> 01:01:49.668
This residence is located in the path of Godzilla.

01:01:49.877 --> 01:01:52.087
Self-Defense Forces have not gotten stopped

01:01:52.546 --> 01:01:54.590
and maybe the Americans either.

01:01:55.048 --> 01:01:58.051
You want me to leave my residence?

01:01:58.260 --> 01:02:02.931
Yes! And other key controls should also be addressed immediately

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:06.059
some ancillary facilities in Tachikawa.

01:02:06.727 --> 01:02:09.229
The American attack is about to begin.

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.775
My duty to stay to oversee its implementation.

01:02:14.026 --> 01:02:17.404
I can not abandon citizens to flee.

01:02:17.779 --> 01:02:20.073
Prime Minister, if you can leave,

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:25.204
because his duty is to protect the nation. Please evacuate.

01:02:25.412 --> 01:02:28.123
Tokyo City Hall still works.

01:02:28.332 --> 01:02:31.919
For now, let the Governor Kozuka take over.

01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:35.047
It's okay.

01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:37.341
Two helicopters reach the roof.

01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:39.593
We will go by car.

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:44.223
Well ahead. Although it will take time.

01:02:45.766 --> 01:02:48.101
There will be a traffic death.

01:02:49.311 --> 01:02:53.065
- See you soon. - All right. I'll crawl if necessary.

01:02:53.357 --> 01:02:57.277
Mandatory evacuation order! Evacuate the building immediately!

01:03:17.464 --> 01:03:20.592
It's all blocked. Traffic is not moving.

01:03:20.843 --> 01:03:25.472
The attack is coming. We must get everyone out of here.

01:03:35.732 --> 01:03:37.109
So that's Godzilla!

01:03:37.943 --> 01:03:40.821
They have decided to bring forward the attack!

01:03:47.536 --> 01:03:51.665
American bombs have hit the target. It's bleeding!

01:03:54.459 --> 01:03:57.504
- It seems to work! - Way to go, USA

01:04:06.388 --> 01:04:09.308
Lord, as the helicopter arrives.

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:25.824
Slowly! Everybody down!

01:04:26.492 --> 01:04:27.409
What's that glow?

01:04:39.713 --> 01:04:43.926
The back of Godzilla shines! There is no more data!

01:04:44.593 --> 01:04:45.969
What are you going to do?

01:05:14.039 --> 01:05:15.123
There's nobody left.

01:05:15.457 --> 01:05:17.167
Come inside!

01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:20.295
Emergency call airbase.

01:05:20.504 --> 01:05:22.422
THE 8 - 2 number 1 has been demolished.

01:05:22.631 --> 01:05:25.551
It can not be: That's impossible.

01:05:28.595 --> 01:05:32.558
Godzilla, the authentic reincarnation of a god.

01:05:32.766 --> 01:05:35.769
The target shooting with a gun from the front.

01:05:35.978 --> 01:05:38.438
3 - 2 and 3 - 3 and continue from the rear.

01:05:38.689 --> 01:05:42.317
- It's time for revenge. Received. Revenge.

01:06:13.307 --> 01:06:16.685
We transport the Prime Minister and another 8 people Tachikawa ...

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.710
high levels of radiation are anticipated.

01:07:23.919 --> 01:07:27.756
It is advised to stay home at least 48 hours.

01:07:27.965 --> 01:07:32.386
How much radiation has issued Godzilla over Tokyo?

01:07:32.678 --> 01:07:35.430
We can not keep waiting for the government to act.

01:07:35.681 --> 01:07:38.058
They say there is a lot of radioactivity.

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:40.978
Will they distribute iodine tablets?

01:07:41.186 --> 01:07:44.439
They are mobilizing nuclear response teams,

01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:49.319
biological and chemical decontamination work for and rescue.

01:07:49.695 --> 01:07:52.239
Prime Minister, the 'secretary' cabinet

01:07:52.531 --> 01:07:56.577
and 5 other ministers more have disappeared.

01:07:56.827 --> 01:08:00.956
Police headquarters and two ministries remain intact.

01:08:15.262 --> 01:08:20.475
It is estimated that millions of people will lose their home.

01:08:20.725 --> 01:08:24.770
Spokesmen for. ' government hope to avoid a political vacuum.

01:08:24.979 --> 01:08:28.984
Party members will choose a prime minister in office.

01:08:29.193 --> 01:08:32.029
The residence of the Prime Minister in danger,

01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:36.158
the government has moved its headquarters to Tachfkawa,

01:08:36.575 --> 01:08:39.536
At the center of the city.

01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:47.294
Deputy Chief Yaguchi!

01:08:47.502 --> 01:08:49.212
- I will call you later. - Mr lzumi ...

01:08:49.421 --> 01:08:50.839
Good thing you're safe.

01:08:51.048 --> 01:08:55.051
And to think I go home on Friday is what saved me.

01:08:55.260 --> 01:09:00.474
- You are injured. You're good? - I am sorry. There is a shortage of bandages.

01:09:00.682 --> 01:09:02.810
Does not matter. Is nothing.

01:09:03.185 --> 01:09:05.229
The council directs the work of firefighters and rescue.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.854
The ministry does not intervene.

01:09:07.064 --> 01:09:08.689
Let the police take care of those affected.

01:09:08.941 --> 01:09:10.776
They will spend night.

01:09:11.026 --> 01:09:14.279
Rumors fly, so go ahead reporters.

01:09:15.197 --> 01:09:17.658
I need information. Where is Godzilla?

01:09:17.866 --> 01:09:21.495
It is idle, near Tokyo Station. Who knows why?

01:09:21.745 --> 01:09:22.996
¿Radiation levels?

01:09:23.247 --> 01:09:27.042
Nuclear Regulatory Authority is taking readings.

01:09:27.792 --> 01:09:32.714
Godzilla mouth spits radiation but very small traces.

01:09:32.923 --> 01:09:34.841
The radioactive cloud has gone into the sea,

01:09:35.050 --> 01:09:37.636
but there is a lot of pollution.

01:09:37.886 --> 01:09:40.514
The most affected districts are uninhabitable,

01:09:40.764 --> 01:09:42.349
besides being contaminated.

01:09:42.599 --> 01:09:45.102
If the circumstances are very serious.

01:09:45.310 --> 01:09:48.689
Lack of men, material and legal infrastructure.

01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:50.399
They're all dead.

01:09:50.607 --> 01:09:54.361
The Prime Minister, the Cabinet Secretary. Everybody.

01:09:54.695 --> 01:09:56.697
Do not derrumbéis!

01:09:56.822 --> 01:09:59.158
We'll manage the survivors!

01:09:59.283 --> 01:10:00.409
Yaguchi ...

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:03.620
First you have to calm down.

01:10:21.847 --> 01:10:22.973
I am sorry.

01:10:25.726 --> 01:10:27.728
Who is the acting Prime Minister?

01:10:27.936 --> 01:10:31.565
He has been appointed the Minister of Agriculture, Yusuke Satomi,

01:10:31.815 --> 01:10:34.026
Acting Prime Minister.

01:10:34.234 --> 01:10:38.030
He will lead a provisional government emergency

01:10:38.238 --> 01:10:40.574
and must form a new cabinet

01:10:40.824 --> 01:10:43.160
to fill the political vacuum.

01:10:43.702 --> 01:10:46.246
So a man with seniority in the government

01:10:46.497 --> 01:10:50.375
and whose loyalty led him to become a minister,

01:10:50.584 --> 01:10:52.628
It is now the Prime Minister.

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.340
I heard that the party secretary has imposed charge.

01:10:56.548 --> 01:11:00.177
Who wants to take responsibility at this time?

01:11:00.552 --> 01:11:03.889
There are worrying movements on the island of Tsushima.

01:11:04.097 --> 01:11:07.726
I guess we will have to wait and see.

01:11:08.227 --> 01:11:10.145
You can act the Foreign Ministry?

01:11:10.395 --> 01:11:12.898
We remain functional.

01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:17.444
In any case, try to avoid unexpected surprises.

01:11:19.196 --> 01:11:21.240
It shall inform the Ambassador.

01:11:28.747 --> 01:11:31.250
These noodles are gone.

01:11:34.169 --> 01:11:37.422
I knew this job would not be easy.

01:11:38.507 --> 01:11:41.426
Satomi is a difficult man to understand.

01:11:41.635 --> 01:11:45.389
Anyway, our mission is to keep the ship afloat.

01:11:45.597 --> 01:11:47.724
We need emergency legislation.

01:11:47.975 --> 01:11:51.937
We are just 30 km from where he sleeps Godzilla.

01:11:52.187 --> 01:11:55.232
That has already stopped worrying.

01:11:55.816 --> 01:11:59.319
In this country we are experts in choosing successors to hurry.

01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:02.030
- Will you be next? - No way.

01:12:05.534 --> 01:12:06.785
Maybe in ten years.

01:12:07.035 --> 01:12:10.247
If Japan continues to exist, could you introduce yourself to the elections.

01:12:10.497 --> 01:12:14.793
I would support changing the position of party secretary.

01:12:17.546 --> 01:12:21.091
Akasaka was in Yokota, so is saved.

01:12:22.050 --> 01:12:25.512
A politician needs strategy and luck.

01:12:25.929 --> 01:12:28.932
Now is the new Secretary of the Cabinet.

01:12:30.017 --> 01:12:32.394
You could be more ambitious.

01:12:34.771 --> 01:12:38.775
Although the Agency Catastrophe is a unique destination.

01:12:39.318 --> 01:12:41.570
And you're pretty much in charge.

01:12:41.778 --> 01:12:44.531
No, I'm here to take on the responsibilities, if necessary.

01:12:44.781 --> 01:12:47.326
Akasaka is very skilled devolving.

01:12:48.035 --> 01:12:50.204
You are the new advisor to the Prime Minister.

01:12:50.454 --> 01:12:54.124
- You're released in your political career. - And what's wrong with that'?

01:12:55.292 --> 01:12:57.794
Why did you become a politician?

01:12:58.045 --> 01:13:01.673
This is all white or black. And that simplicity I like.

01:13:01.882 --> 01:13:04.760
They are members of the Agency arrived.

01:13:08.806 --> 01:13:10.724
I'm glad to see you all.

01:13:11.058 --> 01:13:13.727
More than half of our team is back.

01:13:13.936 --> 01:13:15.062
Thank you.

01:13:16.522 --> 01:13:20.317
Our heart is full of sorrow for those we have lost.

01:13:20.526 --> 01:13:22.277
We have to do it for them!

01:13:23.695 --> 01:13:25.489
Cover your positions ...

01:13:25.739 --> 01:13:27.616
while we suffer ...

01:13:27.866 --> 01:13:30.035
for the loss of our colleagues and loved ones.

01:13:30.869 --> 01:13:32.704
We can get ahead!

01:13:34.498 --> 01:13:36.542
For our compatriots.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.505
I ask you to give yourselves body and soul to finish our work.

01:13:42.005 --> 01:13:42.923
I beg.

01:13:51.014 --> 01:13:54.101
- All work! - To the order.

01:14:04.695 --> 01:14:05.571
I died. - Yes?

01:14:05.821 --> 01:14:07.072
And the plan to freeze?

01:14:07.322 --> 01:14:12.244
Several laboratories are working on 24 procoagulant blood

01:14:12.452 --> 01:14:14.997
silicon-based, thrombin and others.

01:14:15.956 --> 01:14:18.625
- Someone should work. - What signs?

01:14:18.876 --> 01:14:22.629
We have asked alive Self-Defense Forces cells.

01:14:27.301 --> 01:14:27.926
It is understood.

01:14:28.802 --> 01:14:30.596
We have samples.

01:14:30.971 --> 01:14:33.474
I will send them to laboratories BSL4.

01:14:33.724 --> 01:14:34.433
Very good.

01:14:34.850 --> 01:14:38.729
What do we tell the public and private laboratories?

01:14:39.021 --> 01:14:41.523
Substances that are high government secrecy.

01:14:41.773 --> 01:14:44.234
We need information about Godzilla.

01:14:46.195 --> 01:14:50.491
No change in the radiation level. Still below a Sievert.

01:14:50.699 --> 01:14:52.034
It has a very deep sleep.

01:14:52.284 --> 01:14:54.328
It is storing everything in your gut.

01:14:55.913 --> 01:14:56.914
Shift change.

01:15:00.459 --> 01:15:01.335
Aquí Yaguchi.

01:15:01.585 --> 01:15:05.881
Be there in five minutes. Prepare a meeting with the Prime Minister.

01:15:06.590 --> 01:15:10.093
Do you want to provide something that could help us in our struggle?

01:15:10.302 --> 01:15:11.261
That's right?

01:15:11.512 --> 01:15:15.557
Yes. There is a movement, mainly in China and Russia,

01:15:15.808 --> 01:15:18.644
to remove Godzilla Japanese government control

01:15:18.852 --> 01:15:21.688
and put it under the control of international organizations.

01:15:22.231 --> 01:15:24.691
Many countries have aligned themselves with that view.

01:15:25.567 --> 01:15:28.570
However, with respect to this government,

01:15:28.821 --> 01:15:33.200
We hope that Japan and the US Godzilla can control successfully.

01:15:34.034 --> 01:15:34.952
Good.

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:38.163
From the point of view of the government,

01:15:38.413 --> 01:15:42.000
There is no doubt that you would access your collaboration offer.

01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:47.881
However, to meet a functioning government,

01:15:48.090 --> 01:15:50.926
we must respect the lines of action

01:15:51.134 --> 01:15:52.845
marked by the previous government.

01:15:53.679 --> 01:15:54.930
In view of this,

01:15:56.140 --> 01:15:57.015
We accept.

01:15:57.307 --> 01:16:00.394
A US coalition. UU. - Japan to investigate Godzilla?

01:16:00.644 --> 01:16:04.565
The more knowledge, the better. Let's make room.

01:16:05.065 --> 01:16:07.192
Encantado. Soy Rando Yaguchi.

01:16:09.194 --> 01:16:13.365
Images of surveillance unmanned Self-Defense Forces.

01:16:17.327 --> 01:16:19.913
the connection shortly after the attack was lost.

01:16:20.164 --> 01:16:22.207
It was the same with the D2 simulator.

01:16:22.416 --> 01:16:24.084
Just what I feared.

01:16:24.293 --> 01:16:27.880
It seems that Godzilla has a built-in radar waves his face.

01:16:28.463 --> 01:16:30.841
So you can intercept instinctively

01:16:31.049 --> 01:16:32.885
all objects approaching him.

01:16:36.346 --> 01:16:39.224
Unit 2, here CV - 1. 5 minutes are ground zero.

01:16:39.475 --> 01:16:41.643
They are 10 minutes. Change.

01:16:41.852 --> 01:16:43.854
Received, CV-1.

01:16:51.778 --> 01:16:54.823
I am comparing field data with Tsukuba.

01:16:55.032 --> 01:16:58.035
This could be the way Godzilla plans to spread.

01:16:59.328 --> 01:17:03.332
Rapid colonization worldwide.

01:17:03.624 --> 01:17:08.253
You can not only develop and adopt a smaller,

01:17:08.462 --> 01:17:10.714
could develop wings and fly across the ocean.

01:17:12.674 --> 01:17:13.592
Let's move on.

01:17:15.886 --> 01:17:17.513
And it would be the end of the human race.

01:17:17.763 --> 01:17:18.722
Before that,

01:17:18.972 --> 01:17:23.352
nuclear technology is the only thing that can save mankind.

01:17:23.811 --> 01:17:24.895
Are you serious?

01:17:27.314 --> 01:17:30.359
Defense Secretary believes the best is ...

01:17:31.318 --> 01:17:34.279
Godzilla attacking a thermonuclear beam.

01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:37.533
And in the White House?

01:17:37.741 --> 01:17:40.202
There is a report that cites a 13% chance

01:17:40.452 --> 01:17:42.246
that Godzilla lands on the West Coast.

01:17:42.913 --> 01:17:44.665
The Security Council UN

01:17:44.873 --> 01:17:48.126
He has organized a multinational force assault against Godzilla.

01:17:48.961 --> 01:17:50.295
United States is serious.

01:17:52.172 --> 01:17:53.382
I'm afraid so.

01:17:55.592 --> 01:18:00.472
They say you have to attack Godzilla with a nuclear missile.

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:07.062
The Pentagon has approved a nuclear warhead maximum range B83.

01:18:10.315 --> 01:18:14.528
- For release on Tokyo? - I have been ordered to evacuate.

01:18:16.947 --> 01:18:18.448
I get it.

01:18:19.074 --> 01:18:21.785
So it's very likely.

01:18:24.037 --> 01:18:24.913
YES.

01:18:28.792 --> 01:18:30.544
But I will not go back.

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:35.757
I do not want to see a third bomb ...

01:18:37.050 --> 01:18:41.847
fall on the country of my grandmother, who had to suffer the other two.

01:18:45.976 --> 01:18:50.856
Mr President, count on it. Do not worry.

01:18:53.317 --> 01:18:57.237
Definitely. We act accordingly, President Ross.

01:19:04.495 --> 01:19:06.497
Well, you've heard.

01:19:07.581 --> 01:19:11.376
That country we always imposes all sorts of crazy.

01:19:12.127 --> 01:19:13.837
That's clear.

01:19:16.173 --> 01:19:18.425
But this is going too far!

01:19:19.301 --> 01:19:20.427
I agree.

01:19:21.345 --> 01:19:23.639
- Call the Secretary of the Cabinet. - Yes.

01:19:27.059 --> 01:19:31.104
The Security Council UN has adopted a resolution

01:19:31.438 --> 01:19:36.401
for a US force exterminate Godzilla.

01:19:39.071 --> 01:19:42.366
As part of the resolution,

01:19:43.951 --> 01:19:46.954
our nation will be under his command.

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.332
In other words,

01:19:51.792 --> 01:19:54.044
I need a special law

01:19:54.253 --> 01:19:57.047
granting full powers to the Prime Minister.

01:20:05.639 --> 01:20:07.516
To authorize ...

01:20:08.809 --> 01:20:11.228
... the use of nuclear weapons on Tokyo?

01:20:29.705 --> 01:20:34.126
I did not want to go down in history for something.

01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:46.096
It will become UN jurisdiction, depending US

01:20:50.100 --> 01:20:52.686
The postwar Japan is a subsidiary state.

01:20:54.354 --> 01:20:56.857
The war seems to last forever.

01:20:57.691 --> 01:20:59.276
But we must not surrender.

01:21:03.989 --> 01:21:05.866
No creature can withstand

01:21:06.325 --> 01:21:09.244
a million degrees generated by a nuclear missile.

01:21:10.329 --> 01:21:14.625
A safe method of extermination. It is the right decision.

01:21:15.918 --> 01:21:20.339
We are very close to take a big step with the freezing method.

01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:24.259
Your method still too many unknowns.

01:21:24.510 --> 01:21:28.263
Furthermore, all countries have committed to support

01:21:28.514 --> 01:21:32.059
with a full program of reconstruction if we sign.

01:21:32.309 --> 01:21:35.687
If we do not destroy Godzilla, certainly,

01:21:35.896 --> 01:21:38.607
We lose confidence worldwide.

01:21:39.358 --> 01:21:41.985
We must put our fate in the hands of the UN.

01:21:43.654 --> 01:21:47.115
My duty is to think about what to do for Japan

01:21:47.616 --> 01:21:50.452
Once Godzilla has been annihilated.

01:21:51.370 --> 01:21:54.832
Right now, the damage is limited to three districts.

01:21:55.082 --> 01:21:56.792
We can rebuild.

01:21:57.042 --> 01:21:59.378
The city economy is in freefall.

01:21:59.586 --> 01:22:02.840
If bonds and stocks are plummeting,

01:22:03.048 --> 01:22:05.676
the nation will enter bankruptcy.

01:22:06.468 --> 01:22:10.514
Japan needs international support and funding.

01:22:12.558 --> 01:22:14.518
Raze and rebuild, is not it?

01:22:15.394 --> 01:22:16.728
To save the country.

01:22:19.439 --> 01:22:21.150
There is no other solution.

01:22:23.527 --> 01:22:24.778
Yaguchi.

01:22:25.445 --> 01:22:29.366
This is the reality. Everything else is nothing but a dream.

01:22:29.616 --> 01:22:33.412
What? ¿Una thermonuclear bomb?

01:22:33.662 --> 01:22:35.038
Over the city?

01:22:35.247 --> 01:22:38.041
Just we give our approval to the UN.

01:22:38.250 --> 01:22:39.668
Amazing.

01:22:39.918 --> 01:22:43.714
And how do we know that it has not become immortal?

01:22:44.631 --> 01:22:49.344
There are two options: cremate a nuclear missile or freeze.

01:22:49.553 --> 01:22:54.391
Yes, those are the options. But none is good.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:57.603
Man gives me scarier than Godzilla.

01:22:57.811 --> 01:23:02.608
The UN will give us time for evacuation work.

01:23:02.858 --> 01:23:04.860
We will use that time to finish.

01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:09.490
There is something that has worked well with the samples.

01:23:09.698 --> 01:23:10.824
It only remains to produce it.

01:23:11.074 --> 01:23:12.951
To freeze all his blood

01:23:13.243 --> 01:23:16.121
672 kiloliters need coagulant.

01:23:16.371 --> 01:23:18.540
I am in contact with the laboratories.

01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:21.335
- Can we get it? - We must get it as!

01:23:22.419 --> 01:23:25.964
Do not be rindáis. We can not abandon this country.

01:23:26.173 --> 01:23:28.759
Ask all chemical companies that know

01:23:28.967 --> 01:23:31.887
to open all possible lines of production.

01:23:32.095 --> 01:23:34.223
I will send all necessary data.

01:23:34.431 --> 01:23:38.435
Tell all finished production we need for tomorrow.

01:23:38.727 --> 01:23:41.313
We received extensive comparative information.

01:23:41.522 --> 01:23:43.398
Knowledge works.

01:23:56.745 --> 01:23:59.122
Police and the Ministry of Infrastructure should organize

01:23:59.373 --> 01:24:00.624
el del transport coagulant.

01:24:00.833 --> 01:24:01.917
I'll do it.

01:24:02.167 --> 01:24:04.878
The Ministry of Economy coordinates the production of bombs.

01:24:06.046 --> 01:24:08.799
If we commit to buy them,

01:24:09.007 --> 01:24:11.009
Shanghai will give us three tankers.

01:24:11.218 --> 01:24:14.346
We need five trucks the size it.

01:24:19.476 --> 01:24:21.019
Ambassador Lansing

01:24:21.228 --> 01:24:25.482
has just informed us that according to forecasts by the coalition,

01:24:25.732 --> 01:24:27.526
Godzilla energy beam

01:24:27.776 --> 01:24:30.571
will regain its previous levels in less than 360 hours.

01:24:32.781 --> 01:24:37.035
Chances are that the creature resume its activity in 15 days.

01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:39.246
It is understood.

01:24:39.454 --> 01:24:44.418
Attention all non-essential personnel should evacuate the building.

01:24:44.668 --> 01:24:47.588
It has approved the nuclear attack on Godzilla.

01:24:47.796 --> 01:24:49.298
The countdown will begin in 5 minutes.

01:24:50.048 --> 01:24:52.759
So there is no turning back.

01:24:53.051 --> 01:24:56.013
Japan will have a grace period of two weeks

01:24:56.263 --> 01:24:58.307
to evacuate the remaining residents.

01:24:58.515 --> 01:25:01.143
It may seem a lot for the Allied forces,

01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:03.645
but very little for Japan.

01:25:05.647 --> 01:25:10.736
An evacuation means pluck people from their homes.

01:25:13.113 --> 01:25:15.240
Not say it as if it were that easy.

01:25:15.949 --> 01:25:16.742
I agree.

01:25:16.950 --> 01:25:19.828
Evacuate to 3.6 million people? It's stupid!

01:25:20.037 --> 01:25:22.080
We do not have sufficient means.

01:25:22.331 --> 01:25:25.709
Not counting the millions of surrounding districts.

01:25:25.959 --> 01:25:28.462
Governor complains about the sacrifice of Tokyo.

01:25:28.712 --> 01:25:31.673
A national decision, not local.

01:25:31.924 --> 01:25:36.303
Relocation can not be completed within two weeks.

01:25:36.512 --> 01:25:38.847
As Godzilla resumes its activity,

01:25:39.097 --> 01:25:42.059
the date of the attack will be brought forward unconditionally,

01:25:42.309 --> 01:25:44.353
regardless of collateral damage.

01:25:44.561 --> 01:25:49.233
At that moment it will launch a thermonuclear warhead from a submarine

01:25:49.441 --> 01:25:51.568
by decision of the Coalition.

01:25:52.319 --> 01:25:56.323
Woe! How easy it is to decide when it comes to the distant Asia.

01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:01.161
If in New York, they say that would act the same.

01:26:38.949 --> 01:26:42.369
Land prices shooting in the west of the country and food is scarce.

01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:45.747
Businesses and shops are closed Kanto.

01:26:46.081 --> 01:26:47.791
The city is full of unemployed.

01:26:49.543 --> 01:26:52.254
The collapse of the yen reflects investor fear.

01:26:52.963 --> 01:26:55.299
Less benefiting from it.

01:26:56.091 --> 01:26:58.844
There are people of all kinds.

01:27:00.637 --> 01:27:03.390
- Do you have information? - I got it.

01:27:03.891 --> 01:27:05.726
At the end of the day, it's my job.

01:27:06.435 --> 01:27:11.148
What if my article published a day before they throw the bomb?

01:27:14.318 --> 01:27:16.320
Here's the new material Godzilla.

01:27:17.237 --> 01:27:20.616
In return, we can control the timing of the announcement.

01:27:21.158 --> 01:27:24.912
- What do you think? - It is understood.

01:27:30.459 --> 01:27:33.712
Professor abhorred radiation sickness

01:27:33.921 --> 01:27:36.006
that the life of his wife was.

01:27:37.257 --> 01:27:40.844
He expected to be harmless radioactive materials.

01:27:42.387 --> 01:27:44.473
If something like this was possible,

01:27:44.681 --> 01:27:47.059
so would the creation of new materials.

01:27:47.476 --> 01:27:49.770
Certainly feared the military.

01:27:49.978 --> 01:27:53.065
Why hide data from the Department of Energy.

01:27:53.982 --> 01:27:56.985
Hated radioactive materials

01:27:57.694 --> 01:28:00.948
and all those who had any relationship with them.

01:28:02.741 --> 01:28:06.286
Including Japan, who left his wife to die.

01:28:07.329 --> 01:28:10.874
And then let your data and writes "Do what you want '?

01:28:11.458 --> 01:28:12.835
What a strange person!

01:28:15.462 --> 01:28:17.798
And what did he do in the end?

01:28:27.558 --> 01:28:29.434
How good it was!

01:28:32.479 --> 01:28:34.273
Have you already solved the graph?

01:28:34.481 --> 01:28:37.985
I get nothing or with the help of a cryptographer.

01:28:38.235 --> 01:28:39.820
Any word US?

01:28:40.112 --> 01:28:43.073
I would not trust a lot of them, right now.

01:28:43.282 --> 01:28:47.953
It is important for a multilevel approach.

01:28:48.162 --> 01:28:51.623
More than a chemical scheme looks like a mandala.

01:28:51.832 --> 01:28:55.460
0 perhaps is made backward from the solution.

01:28:55.711 --> 01:28:57.796
The man was a bit twisted.

01:28:59.506 --> 01:29:01.800
Even simple lines mystify me.

01:29:02.009 --> 01:29:05.012
Why not put on paper and in electronic form?

01:29:05.596 --> 01:29:08.932
Perhaps it is designed to bend.

01:29:11.602 --> 01:29:14.521
With a body like Godzilla,

01:29:14.771 --> 01:29:18.650
old radioactive debris should leave hungry.

01:29:18.901 --> 01:29:19.818
Definitely.

01:29:20.486 --> 01:29:22.946
Customers have crooked.

01:29:23.197 --> 01:29:26.116
With them you can not grasp nuclear waste.

01:29:31.538 --> 01:29:33.123
Origami.

01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:38.795
They are not eating.

01:29:39.004 --> 01:29:41.715
We have captured the whole pattern,

01:29:41.924 --> 01:29:44.843
The new information comes from the folds.

01:29:45.093 --> 01:29:47.596
We focus on radiation fa as its energy source.

01:29:47.805 --> 01:29:52.100
This is a molecular graph of the conversion elements in your body.

01:29:52.726 --> 01:29:54.645
They are molecules Convertion elements.

01:29:54.895 --> 01:29:58.857
The unknown radioactive isotope is tested.

01:29:59.066 --> 01:30:02.236
If hydrogen or nitrogen enters the cell,

01:30:02.444 --> 01:30:04.488
there becomes necessary molecules.

01:30:04.738 --> 01:30:09.660
It is a mixotrophic with an organ that synthesizes heat decomposition.

01:30:10.118 --> 01:30:11.912
A bold but feasible hypothesis.

01:30:14.164 --> 01:30:16.834
You can live where there is water and oxygen,

01:30:17.084 --> 01:30:19.086
as an ascetic who survives in the mist.

01:30:19.294 --> 01:30:22.673
So Godzilla is a threat to humanity,

01:30:22.965 --> 01:30:26.844
but it is also a finding of unlimited potential.

01:30:27.094 --> 01:30:31.765
But the blood coagulant may not be effective in your body and that

01:30:31.974 --> 01:30:35.227
- end the Yaguchi Plan. - It's possible. And so?

01:30:35.477 --> 01:30:37.938
We need to make it work.

01:30:38.188 --> 01:30:41.984
First we analyze its structure and then how to evade it.

01:30:42.192 --> 01:30:45.320
I have several supercomputers running parallel analyzes,

01:30:45.571 --> 01:30:47.823
but missing days to get the results.

01:30:48.448 --> 01:30:50.284
We only have ten days.

01:30:50.534 --> 01:30:53.912
The Ministry of Science is asking for international aid.

01:30:55.038 --> 01:30:56.498
They have called for Japan.

01:30:56.707 --> 01:30:59.877
We apply a parallel computer analysis.

01:31:00.085 --> 01:31:01.587
We can not!

01:31:01.837 --> 01:31:05.674
Our system is closed.

01:31:05.924 --> 01:31:08.635
We can not risk that we steal data.

01:31:08.886 --> 01:31:10.804
Come on.

01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:14.224
Do not you trust your neighbor?

01:31:14.808 --> 01:31:18.979
Tell them it will be a pleasure to do that analysis.

01:31:30.616 --> 01:31:32.910
We have solved the riddle of Maki!

01:31:38.415 --> 01:31:42.836
- Here. - Is incredible.

01:31:43.504 --> 01:31:46.048
Not the cell membrane itself,

01:31:46.298 --> 01:31:48.467
but a configuration extremophile

01:31:48.717 --> 01:31:50.886
which inhibits the activity of the cell membrane.

01:31:53.764 --> 01:31:57.559
This inhibitor could cause the blood coagulant viable.

01:31:57.810 --> 01:31:59.186
There's still hope.

01:32:01.396 --> 01:32:02.397
It looks good.

01:32:05.234 --> 01:32:06.401
Good!

01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:12.866
I have the feeling that Goro Maki already anticipated this.

01:32:13.992 --> 01:32:18.121
You may liberate this destructive god

01:32:19.248 --> 01:32:22.543
as a kind of test for humanity,

01:32:23.627 --> 01:32:26.964
for this country, for the Japanese.

01:32:29.216 --> 01:32:30.592
"Do what you want '

01:32:32.136 --> 01:32:34.096
including the use of nuclear weapons.

01:32:37.266 --> 01:32:38.433
Can be.

01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:42.187
" That's difficult in this country.

01:32:44.773 --> 01:32:45.274
YES.

01:32:47.317 --> 01:32:48.193
And more on your own.

01:32:48.777 --> 01:32:53.323
Lord, we are putting the final touches of Yaguchi Plan.

01:32:53.699 --> 01:32:56.535
We request your approval to start it.

01:32:56.952 --> 01:32:58.662
Already. But Izumi ...

01:32:59.496 --> 01:33:02.499
The UN resolution has already been approved.

01:33:03.250 --> 01:33:06.670
Some say that the US seeking a quick resolution

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.881
to hide what they know about Godzilla.

01:33:09.131 --> 01:33:11.300
We already know.

01:33:12.426 --> 01:33:14.887
And you know what state the country is.

01:33:15.137 --> 01:33:16.388
But sir ...

01:33:16.597 --> 01:33:20.726
force a country to sacrifice for its own sake is deplorable.

01:33:23.228 --> 01:33:24.521
Then, he hints ...

01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:28.775
to act unilaterally on humanitarian issues.

01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:33.322
Maybe it's time to do what we want.

01:33:34.865 --> 01:33:36.200
He is right.

01:33:37.576 --> 01:33:40.537
So where do I have to sign?

01:33:44.291 --> 01:33:48.045
"Strategy to deliver a coagulant to freeze

01:33:48.253 --> 01:33:50.297
the creature still. "

01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:52.424
It's a little long.

01:33:54.551 --> 01:33:55.803
And how do we call it?

01:33:56.220 --> 01:34:00.724
In honor sake I used to sleep hydra: Operation Yashiori.

01:34:01.558 --> 01:34:04.812
Very good. The 5 phases to execute.

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:07.064
Asaka is finalizing the details.

01:34:07.439 --> 01:34:11.318
Already it is taken the test vehicles

01:34:11.527 --> 01:34:13.445
and mock explosives.

01:34:13.654 --> 01:34:15.322
We are ready for execution.

01:34:16.782 --> 01:34:17.908
Thank you very much.

01:34:18.742 --> 01:34:21.203
You're welcome. It's our job.

01:34:31.421 --> 01:34:33.590
There are only two days.

01:34:36.385 --> 01:34:37.219
Dammit!

01:34:37.427 --> 01:34:40.764
We need three days to produce sufficient coagulant.

01:34:40.973 --> 01:34:43.100
Would not you can stop the countdown?

01:34:43.308 --> 01:34:47.020
Who can we call the Security Council to postpone?

01:34:47.229 --> 01:34:50.482
Neither China nor Russia for geopolitical proximity.

01:34:50.774 --> 01:34:55.946
And France? It is a nuclear country and interest them biological data.

01:34:56.155 --> 01:34:58.532
I have a secret contact. I will try to use it.

01:34:58.782 --> 01:34:59.533
Yes please.

01:34:59.741 --> 01:35:01.618
I'll call the President of Parliament.

01:35:01.827 --> 01:35:04.037
I'll call the Foreign Minister.

01:35:04.288 --> 01:35:07.124
We need 24 hours!

01:35:07.374 --> 01:35:10.419
France has requested stop the countdown.

01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:15.966
China and Russia oppose, but we keep silence.

01:35:16.675 --> 01:35:21.597
There are not only supporters of the hardliners in Washington and the Pentagon.

01:35:23.265 --> 01:35:24.933
Japan has grown enough

01:35:25.142 --> 01:35:28.020
to have international trade agreements at all levels.

01:35:29.563 --> 01:35:32.733
The danger may be an opportunity for personal growth.

01:35:36.695 --> 01:35:40.699
Our friends are about to finalize the plan freezing.

01:35:42.826 --> 01:35:45.287
I think this country wants to bet on that.

01:35:45.787 --> 01:35:48.499
And you're up that bet, so I see.

01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:52.503
Nuclear weapons are a deterrent resource.

01:35:53.670 --> 01:35:57.382
I tried to advise Charles to not use, but ...

01:35:57.925 --> 01:36:00.385
That goes against the majority opinion.

01:36:01.428 --> 01:36:05.015
And you and I have to bear the risk of revenge.

01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:06.892
I really nothing will happen,

01:36:07.267 --> 01:36:12.940
But you, with your controversial opinions and surname Patterson ...

01:36:13.816 --> 01:36:15.234
you'll splash.

01:36:16.777 --> 01:36:21.198
And your dream of being President with 40 years vanish.

01:36:38.132 --> 01:36:39.383
¡ Kayoko!

01:36:41.927 --> 01:36:42.594
Good luck.

01:36:44.138 --> 01:36:44.721
YES.

01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:49.685
- A joint strategy with the United States? - There would be more likely to succeed.

01:36:49.935 --> 01:36:52.980
And can we coordinate our independent controls?

01:36:53.397 --> 01:36:55.399
You have made many friends.

01:36:55.607 --> 01:36:58.360
Volunteers'd Air Force and Marines.

01:36:58.569 --> 01:37:02.239
Even if you need drones. What do you say?

01:37:03.198 --> 01:37:05.367
I'm in. But I can not guarantee anything.

01:37:05.576 --> 01:37:07.786
- I do not know if we will return in one piece. - Of course.

01:37:07.995 --> 01:37:09.621
I'll be all the time with you.

01:37:18.589 --> 01:37:21.508
We have achieved enough inhibitors.

01:37:22.092 --> 01:37:24.678
immediately send trucks.

01:37:27.723 --> 01:37:31.768
Coagulant material and are ready for transport.

01:37:32.019 --> 01:37:33.479
They have a green light.

01:37:34.730 --> 01:37:39.193
Are you sure you want to accompany the troops on the front?

01:37:39.401 --> 01:37:42.529
Perhaps we should take a political decision on the fly

01:37:42.779 --> 01:37:45.782
- and there will be time to consult. - It's too risky.

01:37:46.033 --> 01:37:47.743
It can be directed from the rear.

01:37:48.202 --> 01:37:49.953
You want to be Prime Minister in ten years?

This work comes great responsibility.

01:52:35.547 --> 01:52:39.176
A politician must decide whether to make it yours.

01:52:42.179 --> 01:52:44.056
And I decided to make it mine.

01:52:47.601 --> 01:52:50.479
