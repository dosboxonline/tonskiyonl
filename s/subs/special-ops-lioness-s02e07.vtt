that when our strike team gets

02:57.811 --> 03:00.881
the exposure is already
beyond containment.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.588
We believe it serves
two purposes.

03:40.688 --> 03:41.889
One is to continue

of the border

03:43.324 --> 03:45.459
in order to influence
the election.

04:56.664 --> 05:01.635
So, to that end we stonewalled
every appointment.

Congress, the press,

on a raid across the border

three months to heal

43:22.934 --> 43:24.469
You might be noticing a theme.

43:24.569 --> 43:27.706
He received his PhD
from the Royal Institute

43:27.806 --> 43:29.174

43:29.307 --> 43:31.142
They arrived on Monday.

43:31.242 --> 43:32.576
And on Wednesday,

43:32.577 --> 43:35.245
they were transported
to Diyarbakir Air Base.

43:35.246 --> 43:38.650
It is a known
transshipment point to Iran

43:38.750 --> 43:39.885
for assets and equipment.

43:39.985 --> 43:41.687
Typically,
they would be transported

43:41.787 --> 43:43.453
to Isfahan Nuclear facility.

43:43.454 --> 43:46.324
We do have Predators in place
to strike should that happen,

43:46.457 --> 43:49.927
however, the window for Iraqi
airspace is very narrow.

43:49.928 --> 43:52.430
Suppose we wanted
the strike in Iran.

43:53.364 --> 43:55.466
Uh, I don't know why
you would want that,

43:55.566 --> 43:56.934
but obviously,

43:56.935 --> 43:59.004
it does increase
our tactical opportunities.

43:59.104 --> 44:01.239
[Dixon]
How do they transport?

44:01.339 --> 44:02.874
They use land and air both,

44:03.008 --> 44:05.609
depending on the situation
on the ground.

44:05.610 --> 44:07.378
Our presence not far from there,

44:07.478 --> 44:10.048
as well as enhanced
Kurdish militia elements,

44:10.148 --> 44:14.284
guarantees that the transport
will probably be by helo.

44:14.285 --> 44:16.221
Air traffic from Diyarbakir is

44:16.321 --> 44:18.890
heavily monitored by IDF
and Jordan--

44:19.024 --> 44:20.225
not to mention us--

44:20.325 --> 44:22.193
so they will have to stay
below radar.

44:22.293 --> 44:23.561
- [whispers] What is this?
- Not sure.

44:25.263 --> 44:26.964
[Amber] Outside of a drone,
I don't really know.

44:26.965 --> 44:30.068
Unless you're comfortable
with invading Iranian airspace,

44:30.201 --> 44:31.536
you could call in jets
from <i>Eisenhower,</i>

44:31.669 --> 44:33.204
but then the whole world
is watching.

44:33.304 --> 44:34.138
Can I...

44:34.139 --> 44:35.440
Apologies.

44:35.540 --> 44:37.208
I just need mission clarity.

44:37.308 --> 44:38.509
I thought that this was related

44:38.609 --> 44:40.211
to our operation
along the border.

44:40.311 --> 44:42.413
You said yourself
that the suicide bomber

44:42.547 --> 44:44.515
along the border
was most likely Iranian,

44:44.615 --> 44:46.150
and that his detonation

44:46.151 --> 44:48.185
was to eliminate an asset
that he was escorting.

44:48.186 --> 44:49.387
Correct.

44:49.487 --> 44:50.521
You also said a number
of the individuals

44:50.621 --> 44:51.723
with him were Chinese.

44:51.857 --> 44:52.858
They appeared Asian,
but I cannot say

44:52.958 --> 44:53.858
that they were Chinese.

44:53.859 --> 44:55.426
Are we having an issue

44:55.526 --> 44:58.096
with Japanese or Korean
nationals bypassing immigration?

44:58.196 --> 45:00.265
[sighs] We do not.

45:00.365 --> 45:01.665
But I don't understand
the mission.

45:01.666 --> 45:04.235
The mission
is to show Iran and China

45:04.335 --> 45:08.106
that we aren't the only nation
with an open border.

45:08.206 --> 45:09.074
Got it?

45:09.207 --> 45:10.909
- Got it.
- [Westfield] Good.

45:11.943 --> 45:14.379
What about Carrillo?
Are we discussing that here?

45:14.479 --> 45:16.081
We'll take care of Carrillo,
don't-- Just worry about this.

45:16.181 --> 45:17.848
[Westfield]
Strike options beyond a drone.

45:17.849 --> 45:19.549
[Dixon] You could get a team
on the ground

45:19.550 --> 45:20.919
if you have a flight path.

45:21.052 --> 45:22.453
We could strike
with a Javelin or Stinger.

45:22.553 --> 45:24.221
How do you get the team
in and out?

45:24.222 --> 45:25.957
There's a Kurdish Peshmerga
outpost outside Sulaymaniyah.

45:26.057 --> 45:27.524
You can fly helos in or out.

45:27.525 --> 45:29.894
Well, if that's the case,
and they do move by vehicle,

45:29.895 --> 45:32.297
you could just helo
a team in right here

45:32.397 --> 45:33.631
and strike along that highway,

45:33.731 --> 45:35.532
execute a VI
right on that bridge.

45:35.533 --> 45:37.302
You sure you want
boots on the ground?

45:37.402 --> 45:38.937
Because boots on the ground
takes it out of our hands.

45:39.070 --> 45:40.471
What about a DAP from Sykes?

45:40.571 --> 45:42.473
Assuming it's a transport
helicopter, no escort.

45:42.607 --> 45:45.343
Move them from Sykes
to Sulaymaniyah with a helo.

45:45.443 --> 45:46.978
After that,
it doesn't really matter

45:47.112 --> 45:48.613
if you move them by helo
or you move them by convoy.

45:48.713 --> 45:51.950
Now you got to bring in 160th,
get birds to Sykes.

45:52.050 --> 45:54.820
Well, Sykes has the bird,
I have the pilot.

45:54.920 --> 45:58.388
- [Dixon] You have a pilot?
- [chuckling] Yeah.

45:58.389 --> 46:01.159
The one everyone chose for me.

46:01.259 --> 46:02.961
Now I can finally do something

46:03.061 --> 46:05.296
that she actually
is trained for.

46:07.933 --> 46:09.266
Walk me through worst cases.

46:09.267 --> 46:11.101
Worst case is the bird
gets shot down.

46:11.102 --> 46:12.770
If that happens, you'd need
more than a five-man QRF

46:12.871 --> 46:13.839
to get her out of there.

46:13.972 --> 46:15.473
What do I need on the ground?

46:15.573 --> 46:17.008
[Dixon]
At least two Delta teams

46:17.108 --> 46:18.408
that've worked closely
with Kurdish militia.

46:18.409 --> 46:21.379
Some armor, an MRAP at least.

46:21.479 --> 46:22.680
I'd want some jets on alert.

46:22.780 --> 46:24.015
They can scramble from Al-Asad.

46:24.115 --> 46:27.152
I'd fucking love
another helo or exfil,

46:27.252 --> 46:28.719
and an Apache.

46:30.655 --> 46:31.788
You can get me that?

46:31.789 --> 46:33.124
Want me to get her that?

46:33.224 --> 46:36.627
I want these targets
eliminated in Iran.

46:36.727 --> 46:38.463
Do not hit them in Iraq,

46:38.563 --> 46:40.631
even if the opportunity
presents itself.

46:40.731 --> 46:43.634
They need to know
how far we can reach.

46:43.734 --> 46:45.536
[Dixon] I can get you
everything but the Apache.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.304
Your CAS is coming from Al-Asad.

46:47.305 --> 46:48.939
That's 30 minutes away,
you put them in the air

46:48.940 --> 46:50.341
when the mission launches.

46:50.475 --> 46:51.877
[Westfield]
Can we run this under your flag?

46:51.977 --> 46:53.378
It'd make air support
a lot simpler.

46:53.478 --> 46:55.013
[Dixon] TFO runs intelligence
and logistics.

46:55.146 --> 46:57.682

Don't wish for what
you don't want, Joe.
