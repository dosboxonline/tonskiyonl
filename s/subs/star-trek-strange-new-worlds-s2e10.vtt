With the Gorn,
best I can explain,

29:07.049 --> 29:09.791
I-I did a quick assessment
of their scanning tech,

29:09.835 --> 29:12.707
and I saw how
they recognized each other.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.709
It's similar to
our transponders,

29:14.753 --> 29:16.580

We've determined the location
from which the field emanates.

31:23.533 --> 31:25.622
Short version:
by adjusting our output,

we triangulated the point of
origin of the countersignals.

31:29.061 --> 31:31.585

Now, we don't have any photos,

31:31.628 --> 31:33.413

machine the Gorn brought.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.948

to crash into that structure.
