00:04.448 --> 00:06.684
(indistinct chatter)

00:11.489 --> 00:13.724
* *

00:18.028 --> 00:20.364
You guys!
You guys!

00:21.031 --> 00:22.866
Oh, my God,
you're not gonna believe this!

00:22.966 --> 00:25.336
-Dude, what?
-You guys... (panting)

00:26.670 --> 00:29.873
Heather Williams
farted during P.E. class.

00:29.973 --> 00:32.443
-So?
-So?

00:32.543 --> 00:34.412
Heather Williams
farted during P.E. class!

00:34.512 --> 00:36.647
That means we are
gonna sit courtside

00:36.747 --> 00:38.382
at the Denver Nuggets game
next Saturday!

00:38.482 --> 00:39.683
(muffled shouting)

00:39.783 --> 00:40.618
What?

00:40.718 --> 00:42.420
Ugh! Heather Williams' mom

00:42.520 --> 00:43.621
works for Coors in Golden!

00:43.721 --> 00:45.389
Coors is
the second biggest sponsor

00:45.489 --> 00:47.091
of the Pepsi Center
where the Nuggets play!

00:47.191 --> 00:48.826
We tell Heather that if she
doesn't get us courtside seats,

00:48.926 --> 00:50.694
then everyone's gonna know
she farted in P.E. class!

00:50.794 --> 00:53.897
Whoa. I've never seen
a Nuggets game in person.

00:53.997 --> 00:55.999
Well, we're about to! All we
have to do is show Heather

00:56.100 --> 00:57.701
we have proof
and she'll do whatever we want!

00:57.801 --> 00:59.103
What proof do you have?

00:59.203 --> 01:00.538
Kenny had his phone out!

01:00.638 --> 01:01.839
He got a photo of Heather
right when she farted.

01:01.939 --> 01:04.708
Look! Isn't this awesome,
you guys?!

01:04.808 --> 01:07.111
-Let's go, Nuggets!
-(clapping rhythmically)

01:07.211 --> 01:09.380
ALL:
Let's go, Nuggets!

01:09.480 --> 01:12.082
Let's go, Nuggets!

01:12.183 --> 01:14.017
(school bell rings)

01:15.653 --> 01:18.522
Kids! Kids, can I
have your attention, please.

01:18.622 --> 01:22.092
Kids, listen up.
This is an emergency.

01:22.193 --> 01:26.864
Everything is fine but...
we are sending you all home.

01:26.964 --> 01:28.366
(confused chatter)

01:28.466 --> 01:30.768
Some of you may have heard
but there's a little virus

01:30.868 --> 01:33.604
going around and the school
district wants to make sure

01:33.704 --> 01:36.140
we're all safe,
so we're shutting down

01:36.240 --> 01:38.342
the school for about two weeks.

01:38.442 --> 01:40.511
Two weeks?! Yippie!

01:40.611 --> 01:42.313
(excited chatter)

01:42.413 --> 01:43.714
Oh, not now.

01:43.814 --> 01:45.983
Your parents are here to
pick you up. So let's go.

01:46.083 --> 01:48.886
I'm sure it's nothing; we'll
see you in a couple of weeks.

01:48.986 --> 01:51.054
You guys-- you guys,
Heather Thompson

01:51.155 --> 01:53.524
farted in P.E. class! Guys?

01:57.094 --> 01:59.697
ADULT STAN: Every night
I have the same dream,

01:59.797 --> 02:02.032
and relive
the whole thing again...

02:02.900 --> 02:04.602
ANDREW CUOMO:
It's called social distancing.

02:04.702 --> 02:06.637
If we stay six feet apart
from each other

02:06.737 --> 02:08.239
and wear a mask...

02:08.339 --> 02:11.108
And also I'm shutting down
the city and I'm a pervert.

02:11.209 --> 02:13.211
And we've got to get control
of this thing!

02:13.311 --> 02:15.613
RANDY:
I'm just getting sick of
being here every day with you,

02:15.713 --> 02:16.947
-that's all.
-SHARON: You think

02:17.047 --> 02:19.082
I like being here every day
with you?!

02:19.183 --> 02:20.818
RANDY: I am much easier
to get along with

02:20.918 --> 02:22.686
during a stay-at-home order!

02:22.786 --> 02:25.456
* Happy birthday to you *

02:25.556 --> 02:29.427
* Happy birthday, dear Stan... *

02:31.329 --> 02:33.564
* *

02:38.802 --> 02:41.939
Come on, Stan,
we're gonna visit Grandpa!

02:42.039 --> 02:44.242
Hi, Grandpa!

02:44.342 --> 02:45.843
OTHERS:
Hi, Grandpa!

02:45.943 --> 02:49.012
RANDY: Isn't it great
to see Grandpa, kids?

02:49.112 --> 02:50.781
Look, let's just face it,
you guys.

02:50.881 --> 02:53.717
We don't trust each other
and we don't like each other.

02:54.852 --> 02:56.754
I hate this stupid farm.

02:58.422 --> 03:01.925
In the dream,
I relive the entire pandemic.

03:02.893 --> 03:04.495
SHARON:
Oh, God, no!

03:04.595 --> 03:06.997
My little girl!
(sobbing)

03:07.097 --> 03:09.166
Oh, no! Oh, God!

03:09.267 --> 03:10.801
* *

03:10.901 --> 03:15.273
Now that I'm older,
the dream isn't just a dream

03:15.373 --> 03:20.110
because the whole pandemic
has started all over again.

03:26.317 --> 03:28.552
* *

03:37.995 --> 03:40.030
* *

03:55.646 --> 03:58.949
NEWSMAN: A brand-new variant
of the COVID virus has emerged

03:59.049 --> 04:01.485
in Colorado
and now panic and fear

04:01.585 --> 04:02.986
spreads throughout the world.

04:03.086 --> 04:05.122
The new outbreak started
with the death

04:05.222 --> 04:07.358
of renowned scientist
Kenny McCormick,

04:07.458 --> 04:10.694
and has therefore been named
Kenny McCormikron.

04:10.794 --> 04:13.931
It's been 38 years since
the pandemic first started,

04:14.031 --> 04:17.000
and people are beginning
to say enough is enough.

04:17.100 --> 04:20.070
The town of South Park has been
put under strict lockdown

04:20.170 --> 04:22.005
to try and contain
the new variant.

04:22.105 --> 04:26.610
Nobody is allowed in or out for
the next 20 to 30 years.

04:26.710 --> 04:28.245
(siren wailing)

04:28.346 --> 04:30.080
MALE VOICE: Attention.
You are under quarantine.

04:30.180 --> 04:33.150
Someone in your community
is not vaccinated.

04:33.250 --> 04:36.820
Maintain social distance and
wear a chin diaper if possible.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.890
Attention.
You are under quarantine.

04:39.990 --> 04:42.192
Someone in your community
is not vaccinated.

04:42.292 --> 04:45.295
Maintain social distance
and wear a chin diaper

04:45.396 --> 04:46.830
if possible.

04:46.930 --> 04:49.166
Attention.
You are under quarantine.

04:49.266 --> 04:51.602
Someone in your community
is not...

04:51.702 --> 04:55.539
(woman speaking Japanese)

04:55.639 --> 04:58.108
MALE VOICE 2:
Come on inside and rejuvenate.

04:58.208 --> 05:01.244
Denny's is now
Denny's Applebee's Max.

05:01.345 --> 05:03.046
Taste the difference.

05:03.146 --> 05:05.783
(soft electronic music playing)

05:07.117 --> 05:08.719
Welcome to
Denny's Applebee's Max.

05:08.819 --> 05:10.153
Just one joining us today?

05:11.121 --> 05:12.289
Listen to me very carefully

05:12.390 --> 05:14.525
and try not to
change your expression.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.894
They could be listening.

05:16.994 --> 05:20.931
This... is the last
sprout of Tegridy Weed.

05:21.031 --> 05:24.134
We have to get it somewhere
outside of town.

05:24.234 --> 05:26.370
Sir, the whole town is
under quarantine.

05:26.470 --> 05:28.171
Nothing's allowed in or out.

05:28.271 --> 05:29.873
We have to replicate it.

05:29.973 --> 05:32.743
It's the only way for people
to have Tegridy again.

05:32.843 --> 05:34.878
Uh, okay, sir,
if you don't want to eat,

05:34.978 --> 05:36.380
then I'll need to
ask you to leave.

05:36.480 --> 05:38.916
Don't you understand
this could change the world.

05:39.016 --> 05:40.984
Maybe the Denny's side
of you doesn't care,

05:41.084 --> 05:43.954
but the Applebee's side of you
must want to help!

05:44.054 --> 05:45.523
There you are, Mr. Marsh.

05:45.623 --> 05:48.058
Come on. Time to go
back to the old folks home.

05:48.158 --> 05:50.861
I can't go back!
Everyone listen!

05:50.961 --> 05:53.931
This little sprout
is humanity's only hope!

05:54.031 --> 05:56.667
Let's go back to
the retirement home.

05:56.767 --> 05:58.502
We can get you
some nice ice cream, okay?

05:58.602 --> 06:01.972
I don't want ice cream,
I want my species to survive!

06:02.072 --> 06:04.475
-Back off!
-Let's go, Mr. Marsh!

06:04.575 --> 06:06.444
Don't make this
difficult for us!

06:06.544 --> 06:08.311
(yelling)

06:12.483 --> 06:14.818
Why, you son of a bitch.

06:20.257 --> 06:22.359
(grunting)

06:26.964 --> 06:29.500
-Come on, Mr. Marsh.
-Who...?

06:29.600 --> 06:33.871
It's me, Token.
We know about the pangolin.

06:35.105 --> 06:37.074
Your son and his friends
are trying to stop all this

06:37.174 --> 06:39.943
from happening. We need
to get you to Kenny's lab.

06:43.280 --> 06:46.817
Dr. Kenneth McCormick
will now be attempting to

06:46.917 --> 06:49.252
travel back in time
in order to stop

06:49.352 --> 06:52.055
the COVID pandemic
from ever happening.

06:52.155 --> 06:53.891
WENDY: At the moment
Kenny time traveled,

06:53.991 --> 06:56.093
he blew all the transformers
here in the lab.

06:56.193 --> 06:58.228
If you're going to try
and replicate his work,

06:58.328 --> 07:00.030
we'll be doing it
at half capacity.

07:00.130 --> 07:02.165
The bigger problem
is that we can't even get

07:02.265 --> 07:04.201
into half of Kenny's equipment.

07:04.301 --> 07:07.237
We have access to the machines,
but the codes to operate

07:07.337 --> 07:10.440
those machines are behind
an 86-Mag firewall

07:10.541 --> 07:11.842
with restricted access,

07:11.942 --> 07:13.977
requiring an in-person
vocal scan of either

07:14.077 --> 07:17.280
Kenny McCormick or of
his associate, Victor Chouce.

07:17.380 --> 07:20.751
But Kenny is dead and Chouce is
locked away in a mental asylum.

07:20.851 --> 07:22.953
So we go to the asylum
and convince them

07:23.053 --> 07:25.188
to let us
bring Chouce here, easy.

07:25.288 --> 07:26.423
There's more.

07:26.524 --> 07:28.058
(alarm blaring over video)

07:28.158 --> 07:30.494
When Kenny bent time,
the negative ions

07:30.594 --> 07:32.563
actually killed
everyone else in the room.

07:32.663 --> 07:35.999
We have to find some thin,
reflective material

07:36.099 --> 07:38.301
that can be worn
to bounce the energy.

07:38.401 --> 07:41.438
We're going to need...
some aluminum foil.

07:41.539 --> 07:44.542
* *

07:44.642 --> 07:46.443
Jesus Christ.

07:46.544 --> 07:47.845
Aluminum foil?

07:47.945 --> 07:50.614
That's impossible, Wendy.
It's the fucking future.

07:50.714 --> 07:52.215
All the aluminum foil is stuck

07:52.315 --> 07:54.317
out on cargo ships
in Long Beach.

07:54.417 --> 07:55.586
Yeah, I know.

07:55.686 --> 07:58.922
Look, guys, I know
this is all a long shot.

07:59.022 --> 08:01.158
But Kenny went
back in time and got COVID

08:01.258 --> 08:03.226
because it destroyed
our friendship.

08:03.326 --> 08:06.964
All of this is our fault,
and we can't do it without you.

08:07.064 --> 08:09.900
I'll help however I can
to stop this stupid pandemic

08:10.000 --> 08:11.201
once and for all.

08:11.301 --> 08:13.270
Yeah, I can't be stuck
in quarantine

08:13.370 --> 08:16.707
my whole life-- I gotta get back
to my job doing future comedy.

08:16.807 --> 08:18.542
Speakin' of which,
what's the biggest

08:18.642 --> 08:21.311
difference between
a Christian man and a lesbian?

08:21.411 --> 08:23.246
Absolutely nothing.
They are totally the same

08:23.346 --> 08:25.115
and deserve
to be treated as such.

08:25.883 --> 08:28.085
Thanks, everybody.
We can do this!

08:28.185 --> 08:29.853
Wendy, you guys
stay here and try

08:29.953 --> 08:31.154
to get the lab running again.

08:31.254 --> 08:33.090
Kyle and I will go get
Victor Chouce.

08:33.190 --> 08:35.258
Tweek and Craig, you guys find
some aluminum foil.

08:35.358 --> 08:38.395
-How the hell do we do that?!
-Just start looking!

08:38.495 --> 08:39.630
Come on, guys!

08:40.530 --> 08:43.701
-All right, let's do this!
-I'll drive, get in the back.

08:43.801 --> 08:47.370
Alexa! Set a course
for South Park Mental Asylum.

08:49.840 --> 08:54.411
Alexa, set a course
for South Park Mental Asylum.

08:55.312 --> 08:57.014
Do you ever think
about how the way

08:57.114 --> 08:59.049
you act affects other people?

08:59.149 --> 09:01.752
Oh, no, goddamn it.
Not right now.

09:01.852 --> 09:03.921
Oh, yeah, don't wanna
talk about that.

09:04.021 --> 09:06.189
Let's just pretend like
that's not even an issue.

09:06.289 --> 09:09.026
Alexa, please,
we have to get to the asylum

09:09.126 --> 09:10.761
and we don't know where it is.

09:10.861 --> 09:13.030
-Who's this?
-It's just my Alexa.

09:13.130 --> 09:15.933
"Just my Alexa"?
You're a piece of shit!

09:16.033 --> 09:18.468
You're a fucking alcoholic
piece of shit!

09:18.568 --> 09:21.605
-Alexa...
-Find the asylum
your fucking self!

09:21.705 --> 09:23.573
Find it your fucking self.

09:23.674 --> 09:24.775
(sighs)

09:24.875 --> 09:26.343
You do whatever
the fuck you want

09:26.443 --> 09:29.046
and just destroy
the people around you.

09:29.146 --> 09:32.049
And by the way,
there's a tankless humidifier

09:32.149 --> 09:34.284
available from one
of your favorite sellers.

09:34.384 --> 09:35.619
Would you like to know more?!

09:35.719 --> 09:38.155
Yes, yes, I'd like to know more.

09:38.255 --> 09:41.992
(sniffles) Okay. The newest
humidifiers from Walgreens Max

09:42.092 --> 09:44.361
are actually tankless
and use up to 50%

09:44.461 --> 09:46.596
less water
than standard humidifiers.

09:46.697 --> 09:50.500
Okay, that's really cool. Uh,
add that to my shopping list.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.336
Well, and people who
were interested

09:53.436 --> 09:55.906
in tankless humidifiers
were also interested in

09:56.006 --> 09:57.407
three-pack filters.

09:57.507 --> 09:59.609
That's great. Do those have
the Prime delivery?

09:59.710 --> 10:01.544
Dude, we don't really
have time for this.

10:01.645 --> 10:03.814
Dude, shut the fuck up!

10:03.914 --> 10:06.149
* *

10:09.720 --> 10:12.956
Please help see us through
this new COVID variant.

10:13.056 --> 10:15.625
Please help us
to make it through this

10:15.726 --> 10:17.027
difficult quarantine.

10:17.127 --> 10:19.629
And let people see that...

10:19.730 --> 10:23.934
as bad as COVID is,
it's not as bad as diabetes.

10:24.034 --> 10:25.402
(door opens)

10:25.502 --> 10:26.870
Hello?

10:26.970 --> 10:29.639
Sorry, the church is closed
due to the COVID variant.

10:29.740 --> 10:33.744
Father, please.
Will you protect my family?

10:33.844 --> 10:35.713
Rabbi Cartman?

10:35.813 --> 10:37.981
My family isn't safe, Father.

10:38.081 --> 10:40.417
I realize now
that Kyle Broflovski

10:40.517 --> 10:42.452
will stop at nothing
to break us apart.

10:42.552 --> 10:44.755
Uncle Kyle hates us
because we're Jewish.

10:44.855 --> 10:46.924
And he's a self-hating Jew.

10:47.024 --> 10:48.726
Uncle Kyle, no, no, no!

10:48.826 --> 10:50.327
Menorah, hold your brother.

10:50.427 --> 10:52.696
As a fellow person of faith,
Father,

10:52.796 --> 10:53.964
I'm begging you to help us.

10:54.064 --> 10:56.066
Well, well,
what can I do, Rabbi?

10:56.166 --> 10:58.702
Kyle has already
convinced a bunch of people

10:58.802 --> 11:00.270
to join his cause.

11:00.370 --> 11:03.206
I have to create my own secret
rebellion to stop him.

11:03.306 --> 11:05.008
Eric, please, I'm scared

11:05.108 --> 11:07.277
and I don't understand
all of this.

11:08.245 --> 11:10.580
Kyle wants to go back in time...

11:10.680 --> 11:14.151
and change the past so that you
and I possibly never even meet.

11:14.251 --> 11:18.588
If I never met you,
my life would be meaningless.

11:18.688 --> 11:23.326
Mine, too.
You are my whole world.

11:23.426 --> 11:27.998
I promise you that I will do
everything I can to stop Kyle...

11:28.098 --> 11:30.467
and save our family.

11:30.567 --> 11:32.602
* *

11:37.941 --> 11:39.576
(bird cawing)

11:41.244 --> 11:43.046
I understand that you wish

11:43.146 --> 11:44.681
to see one of our inmates.

11:44.782 --> 11:46.750
-Victor Chouce?
-Yeah.

11:46.850 --> 11:48.752
We-we have a lot of questions
for Mr. Chouce.

11:48.852 --> 11:52.422
He's an extremely dangerous
and diluted individual.

11:52.522 --> 11:54.858
We don't take
visitations lightly.

11:54.958 --> 11:56.726
What exactly did he do?

11:56.827 --> 11:58.528
Unspeakable things.

11:58.628 --> 12:02.800
He has destroyed lives.
This entire state has never seen

12:02.900 --> 12:04.367
a monster of his magnitude.

12:04.467 --> 12:06.770
I've lived in South Park
all my life

12:06.870 --> 12:08.305
and I've never heard of him.

12:08.405 --> 12:11.441
That's because Victor
has been hidden from view...

12:11.541 --> 12:14.677
ever since the pandemic began.

12:14.778 --> 12:18.548
Victor's parents were very
protective during the pandemic.

12:18.648 --> 12:20.583
Even when the stay-at-home
orders were lifted

12:20.683 --> 12:23.553
his parents kept him
locked away in his room.

12:24.521 --> 12:27.390
Victor longed to
go outside and play.

12:27.490 --> 12:33.330
Then 2021 happened, people
thought the pandemic was over.

12:33.430 --> 12:35.532
Victor's parents left
him grounded in his room

12:35.632 --> 12:38.568
while they went to
see a movie in Denver.

12:38.668 --> 12:40.237
They never returned.

12:40.337 --> 12:44.207
Victor was grounded in his room
for over 16 years.

12:46.143 --> 12:48.211
His name isn't Chouce.

12:48.311 --> 12:50.713
It's Chaos.

12:55.652 --> 12:59.089
We are not responsible for what
happens to you in there.

13:00.790 --> 13:02.125
I warn you...

13:02.225 --> 13:04.828
you are not going to like
what you're about to see.

13:15.772 --> 13:17.975
* *

13:18.075 --> 13:20.577
(clears throat)
Excuse me.

13:20.677 --> 13:21.845
Hello?

13:26.749 --> 13:28.651
Well, hey, fellas!

13:28.751 --> 13:30.220
Butters...

13:30.320 --> 13:32.189
I thought you were
just the guards again.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.324
It's good to see
some new faces in here.

13:34.424 --> 13:36.793
I'll bet you're looking to
make yourselves some money, huh?

13:36.894 --> 13:38.728
Well, you came to the right guy.

13:38.828 --> 13:40.697
My name's Vic. Vic Chaos.

13:40.797 --> 13:43.300
There's a whole lot of people
that can tell you how much money

13:43.400 --> 13:45.869
Vic Chaos made them, so don't
just take my word for it.

13:45.969 --> 13:48.872
Butters, it's your old friends
Stan and Kyle.

13:48.972 --> 13:52.242
Stan and Kyle.
Stan and Kyle...

13:52.342 --> 13:53.743
I know what you're thinking.

13:53.843 --> 13:56.446
You're thinking,
"What can Vic Chaos do for me?"

13:56.546 --> 13:58.181
We all wanna be happy, right?

13:58.281 --> 14:00.250
We all want our little piece
of the apple pie!

14:00.350 --> 14:01.885
Everyone else
is out making a buck,

14:01.985 --> 14:03.921
why shouldn't you guys
be making the kind of cash

14:04.021 --> 14:05.555
you deserve? Am I right?

14:06.356 --> 14:08.491
Butters, we're here
to ask you about Kenny.

14:08.591 --> 14:10.460
Sorry, guys,
you have me confused.

14:10.560 --> 14:12.695
I think Butters was
a twerpy little loser kid

14:12.795 --> 14:14.965
whose parents didn't love him.
My name's Vic.

14:15.065 --> 14:16.566
Vic Chaos.

14:17.400 --> 14:20.904
Okay, Vic, can you tell us
about this?

14:21.004 --> 14:24.541
Why is your name all over
Kenny McCormick's research?

14:24.641 --> 14:28.045
Oh, Dr. McCormick! Sure,
I did some things for him.

14:28.145 --> 14:30.380
Where do you think he got all
the money to do his experiments,

14:30.480 --> 14:32.449
huh? I had said to him,
I said, "Ken,

14:32.549 --> 14:34.217
"you've got all these
crazy ideas but you got

14:34.317 --> 14:37.620
no capital to see 'em through.
Let me help you out with that."

14:37.720 --> 14:38.855
You know,
he's a really great guy.

14:38.956 --> 14:40.157
Let me get you all together.

14:40.257 --> 14:41.992
Maybe you can all
do a lunch or something.

14:42.092 --> 14:44.294
Victor, Kenny's dead.

14:44.394 --> 14:47.197
Oh, whoa, bummer alert.
(chuckles)

14:47.297 --> 14:50.433
Just goes to show you, huh,
there's never enough time to get

14:50.533 --> 14:51.969
out there
and make the kind of money

14:52.069 --> 14:53.536
you always dreamed of making.

14:53.636 --> 14:54.938
Well, I'll tell you what, guys,

14:55.038 --> 14:57.740
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret--

14:57.840 --> 14:59.842
I'm gonna
tell you something that's

14:59.943 --> 15:01.511
going to change your life.

15:01.611 --> 15:04.114
Have you ever heard of NFTs?

15:04.214 --> 15:07.417
(alarm blaring)

15:17.160 --> 15:19.396
(bubbling)

15:21.965 --> 15:26.569
There you go.
Shh. You're safe now.

15:26.669 --> 15:30.607
Look how fast you're growing.
Daddy loves you so much.

15:30.707 --> 15:33.410
Mr. Marsh, we need to
speak with you now, please.

15:33.510 --> 15:35.845
Yeah.
It's looking good.

15:35.945 --> 15:39.649
With the aquaponics, the weed is
already putting out new sprouts.

15:39.749 --> 15:43.620
Thank you all for helping me
get the Tegridy somewhere safe.

15:43.720 --> 15:46.489
I know you all realize
how important it is.

15:46.589 --> 15:50.127
We don't actually care
about the marijuana, Mr. Marsh.

15:50.227 --> 15:51.828
What we need to know...

15:51.928 --> 15:54.831
is exactly where in
Wuhan, China you were

15:54.931 --> 15:58.501
when you had intercourse
with a pangolin.

16:00.503 --> 16:02.339
That's really not important.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.874
It's extremely important
because to save this town,

16:04.974 --> 16:06.543
your son and his friends
are going to try

16:06.643 --> 16:09.179
to go back in time
and stop it from happening.

16:09.279 --> 16:11.948
That is the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

16:14.284 --> 16:15.952
Mr. Marsh,
we are all in lockdown

16:16.053 --> 16:17.320
for the next half century.

16:17.420 --> 16:19.322
If there's even a chance
of altering the past

16:19.422 --> 16:20.623
so that this doesn't happen...

16:20.723 --> 16:23.026
This is the key
to saving our town!

16:23.126 --> 16:27.064
The answer is in what we
all do now, in the present!

16:27.164 --> 16:29.132
And I'm sorry, but focusing on

16:29.232 --> 16:31.234
who started the pandemic
is racist.

16:32.069 --> 16:36.439
Mr. Marsh, exactly what week
did you travel to China in 2019?

16:36.539 --> 16:38.675
Do you understand
the butterfly effect?

16:38.775 --> 16:43.113
How one small thing in time
can infect the entire future?

16:43.213 --> 16:46.349
You can theorize all you want
on changing events

16:46.449 --> 16:48.951
that happened in the past
but I promise you...

16:49.052 --> 16:53.056
I fuck that pangolin
every single time.

16:53.156 --> 16:55.392
* *

16:57.394 --> 16:58.961
Please, we're not done!

16:59.062 --> 17:00.730
We have more questions
for Butters.

17:00.830 --> 17:03.333
You've upset him and I
specifically asked you not to.

17:03.433 --> 17:06.803
How'd we upset him?
He seems fine.

17:06.903 --> 17:08.138
He seems fine?

17:08.238 --> 17:10.640
Do you have any idea
what he did to people?

17:10.740 --> 17:12.642
Do you know why Victor Chouce is

17:12.742 --> 17:15.044
kept under such strict
surveillance?

17:15.145 --> 17:18.581
Being grounded all those years
in his room,

17:18.681 --> 17:20.683
he had access to an iPad.

17:20.783 --> 17:24.521
He started learning about NFTs.

17:24.621 --> 17:28.291
Then before long,
he was trading them online.

17:28.391 --> 17:30.627
-So?
-So?!

17:30.727 --> 17:32.662
He escaped once before.

17:32.762 --> 17:34.897
In just a few hours
he managed to get thousands

17:34.997 --> 17:38.635
of people to invest in NFTs.
Just like he almost did you.

17:38.735 --> 17:40.503
He didn't convince us
to do anything.

17:40.603 --> 17:43.906
Trust me, another 30 seconds
in that room and you

17:44.006 --> 17:47.344
would have started considering
NFTs as a viable investment.

17:48.178 --> 17:49.579
Please listen to me.

17:49.679 --> 17:52.449
Butters used the money
he made off NFTs to finance

17:52.549 --> 17:54.584
-our friend's...
-He didn't make money off NFTs,

17:54.684 --> 17:57.820
he made it off getting
other people to buy NFTs!

17:57.920 --> 17:59.088
Okay, whatever!

17:59.189 --> 18:00.690
But he was working
with Kenny McCormick

18:00.790 --> 18:02.625
who was actually
trying to fix things.

18:02.725 --> 18:04.294
He was Kenny's main investor.

18:04.394 --> 18:07.530
If you don't believe me, look
at the paper I gave Butters.

18:08.931 --> 18:11.468
You gave Victor
a piece of paper?

18:11.568 --> 18:14.771
You gave Victor a piece
of paper?!

18:20.677 --> 18:22.945
Hey, can you hear me?

18:24.781 --> 18:27.016
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

18:27.116 --> 18:28.685
NFTs are gonna blow up.

18:28.785 --> 18:29.986
You should really get in now

18:30.086 --> 18:31.488
'cause they're really
the future.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.823
Why would I invest
in a digital good?

18:33.923 --> 18:35.292
(muttering):
You can't even... Stupid.

18:35.392 --> 18:36.826
That's what the critics
are saying

18:36.926 --> 18:38.895
but see, they don't understand.

18:39.896 --> 18:42.899
Victor...!

18:51.374 --> 18:53.576
No. No, no, no, no...

18:53.676 --> 18:56.145
Gone. Just gone.

18:57.113 --> 18:59.249
My savings. My house.

18:59.349 --> 19:00.783
But I have this.

19:00.883 --> 19:03.620
Little green panda bear
on a skateboard.

19:05.455 --> 19:08.625
No. No!

19:10.827 --> 19:14.631
Without morality,
there is no God.

19:15.665 --> 19:17.867
The basis of
the entire Jewish faith

19:17.967 --> 19:21.338
is on a covenant between God
and humanity.

19:21.438 --> 19:24.407
To try and mess with time
is wrong.

19:24.507 --> 19:26.876
Rather, it is playing God.

19:26.976 --> 19:30.380
And I am glad to have you all
come here today to help me

19:30.480 --> 19:34.551
stop these individuals who
would try to change the future.

19:34.651 --> 19:37.387
Kyle Broflovski
has led people astray

19:37.487 --> 19:38.888
and is at this very moment

19:38.988 --> 19:41.424
trying to bend the fabric
of time.

19:41.524 --> 19:47.230
Together we can stop him
and stop this blasphemy of God.

19:49.098 --> 19:50.833
-Yes?
-Um...

19:50.933 --> 19:53.002
This is about
actual time travel?

19:53.102 --> 19:55.505
I thought this was
a Doctor Who convention.

19:55.605 --> 19:59.075
(robotically):
Exterminate. Exterminate.

20:00.743 --> 20:02.545
Kevin, goddamn it.

20:02.645 --> 20:04.981
You have done this
your whole goddamn life.

20:05.081 --> 20:08.217
No, this is not about
Doctor Who,

20:08.318 --> 20:10.186
this is about real time travel.

20:10.287 --> 20:11.721
People are really trying

20:11.821 --> 20:14.757
to go back in time,
and we are the rebellion

20:14.857 --> 20:16.759
who must secretly
and urgently...

20:16.859 --> 20:18.995
-(banging)
-Who is that?!

20:19.095 --> 20:20.530
Make sure they know
the password!

20:20.630 --> 20:22.198
I'm on it!

20:23.099 --> 20:26.102
They might be on to us.
Oh, God, no.

20:29.105 --> 20:32.442
Shh! You guys stay quiet.
Someone is here.

20:33.242 --> 20:36.446
-Eric, I'm scared.
-Are they going to get us, Papa?

20:36.546 --> 20:38.948
Nobody is going
to touch my family.

20:39.048 --> 20:41.318
I started
writing a diary, Daddy.

20:41.418 --> 20:44.854
About all the things
Uncle Kyle is doing to us.

20:45.688 --> 20:47.357
Oh, my God, I love you so much.

20:47.457 --> 20:48.991
Just-just shh, okay? Just shh.

20:49.091 --> 20:51.628
I'll be right back, okay?
Just shh.

20:54.464 --> 20:55.498
Hello?

20:55.598 --> 20:57.734
Father?
Are you in there?

20:57.834 --> 20:59.969
H-Hello? W-Who is it?

21:00.069 --> 21:01.838
Father, it's Tweek and Craig.

21:01.938 --> 21:04.073
We need to talk to you
about something urgent.

21:04.173 --> 21:06.142
Is it about our
super-secret rebel group

21:06.242 --> 21:07.910
to stop people
from time traveling?

21:08.010 --> 21:09.779
(shouts)
what the hell are you doing?!

21:09.879 --> 21:11.814
-What?
-You don't tell people

21:11.914 --> 21:13.916
about our super-secret
rebel group, Scott!

21:14.016 --> 21:15.785
CRAIG:
Father, are you there?

21:15.885 --> 21:18.154
Uh, uh, yeah, I'm here.

21:18.254 --> 21:20.990
Sorry, I was just talking
about a Star Wars movie.

21:21.090 --> 21:23.326
I'm Scott Malkinson.
I have diabetes.

21:23.426 --> 21:25.962
-Hey, now, come on.
-Shh!

21:26.062 --> 21:28.297
CRAIG: Father, we're with some
people who are trying to finish

21:28.398 --> 21:30.800
Kenny McCormick's work
and save the town.

21:30.900 --> 21:33.536
Oh, really? That's cool.

21:33.636 --> 21:35.137
How far along are they?

21:35.237 --> 21:37.507
CRAIG: Really close. We have
the method of time travel

21:37.607 --> 21:40.477
and we're just trying
to find some aluminum foil!

21:40.577 --> 21:43.380
Aluminum foil? The fuck?

21:43.480 --> 21:46.816
All right, guys, let me
help you out with that.

21:48.818 --> 21:51.788
Father!
You have-you have tin foil?!

21:51.888 --> 21:53.723
Thank you for your help.
(grunts)

21:54.524 --> 21:55.958
Aah!

21:57.560 --> 22:01.931
This is Dr. Wendy Testaburger
from inside the quarantine zone.

22:02.031 --> 22:04.401
We need assistance
with our power.

22:04.501 --> 22:06.235
(static crackling)

22:06.335 --> 22:09.606
MAN: Yes, Mrs. Testaburger,
how can we help you?

22:09.706 --> 22:12.942
We have several transformers
down in our lab.

22:13.042 --> 22:15.945
We may have a radical way
to stop the new variant

22:16.045 --> 22:18.314
but we need more power.

22:20.049 --> 22:23.486
You say you might be able
to stop the McCormikron variant?

22:23.586 --> 22:27.624
Yes, but we're running at about
40% capacity right now.

22:27.724 --> 22:29.426
Well, Doctor, if it's for that,

22:29.526 --> 22:32.228
we can try to get a tech team
to drop in by helicopter

22:32.328 --> 22:34.363
and access your building
from the roof.

22:34.464 --> 22:37.066
-Yes! That would be amazing.
-All right!

22:37.166 --> 22:38.835
I have a crew standing by.

22:38.935 --> 22:40.470
We'll get you as much juice
as you need.

22:40.570 --> 22:42.639
We just need to make sure
our crew is safe.

22:42.739 --> 22:45.007
Has everyone in your lab
been vaccinated?

22:47.744 --> 22:48.778
Uh...

22:48.878 --> 22:50.880
Yes, we are all vaccinated.

22:50.980 --> 22:52.615
I'm not vaccinated.

22:52.715 --> 22:54.316
(others exclaim)

22:54.417 --> 22:57.420
Uh, okay, we're gonna have to
get back to you on that.

22:57.520 --> 23:01.123
It's okay, it's okay,
we can get everyone vaccinated!

23:01.223 --> 23:03.926
I am not ever
getting vaccinated.

23:04.026 --> 23:06.095
Sorry, ma'am,
it's the fucking future.

23:06.195 --> 23:08.264
We have to respect his beliefs.

23:08.364 --> 23:10.633
Clyde, why do you
insist on making all this

23:10.733 --> 23:12.001
harder on everyone?!

23:12.101 --> 23:14.937
I'm sorry,
but an expert once told me

23:15.037 --> 23:17.640
that the vaccine would
make me grow titties on my head.

23:17.740 --> 23:19.709
He was very knowledgeable!

23:19.809 --> 23:22.311
You guys might wanna see this.

23:23.546 --> 23:25.782
* *

23:28.585 --> 23:32.254
With the equipment here I'm able
to make it grow up so fast.

23:32.354 --> 23:34.624
We need to take this and analyze
its molecular structure.

23:34.724 --> 23:37.359
Wha-- no, no, no! We need to
get this out to people!

23:37.460 --> 23:40.296
That's why Dr. McCormick
stole it from my barn!

23:40.396 --> 23:43.065
No, your marijuana
had some special property that

23:43.165 --> 23:44.634
allowed Kenny to time travel.

23:44.734 --> 23:46.969
Well, it is special,
but you people

23:47.069 --> 23:49.071
need to stop trying
to change the past!

23:49.171 --> 23:52.975
COVID happened.
Space Jam 2 happened.

23:53.075 --> 23:56.613
All we can do now is try
and change the way people think!

23:56.713 --> 23:59.448
-(phone rings)
-Yeah.

23:59.549 --> 24:00.750
What?

24:01.751 --> 24:03.820
Victor Chouce
is actually Butters?

24:03.920 --> 24:05.655
Yeah, he spent years in his room

24:05.755 --> 24:07.724
and made billions trading
in NFTs.

24:07.824 --> 24:09.425
It's where Kenny
got all his money.

24:09.526 --> 24:12.629
Well, can you bring him here? We
need him to access the machines.

24:12.729 --> 24:15.097
He's gone.
He escaped the asylum

24:15.197 --> 24:16.933
and he's out somewhere
probably trying to get

24:17.033 --> 24:18.735
people to invest in NFTs.

24:18.835 --> 24:20.737
Did you try
looking at his old house?

24:20.837 --> 24:22.805
Maybe he'd go back
to where it all started.

24:22.905 --> 24:24.206
KYLE:
Yeah, that's where we are now.

24:24.306 --> 24:26.776
But his house has been changed
into a pho shop.

24:26.876 --> 24:29.912
Oh, Jesus, like the future
needs another fucking pho shop.

24:30.012 --> 24:31.781
Yeah, the future fucking sucks.

24:31.881 --> 24:35.384
Hello, City Pho.
Take your order please?

24:35.484 --> 24:38.054
-Oh, God.
-TOKEN: Stan, listen.

24:38.154 --> 24:39.722
If Butters wants
to pitch investments,

24:39.822 --> 24:42.959
he might go to one of those
co-working coffee flex spaces.

24:43.059 --> 24:45.127
That's where his biggest
targets will hang out.

24:45.227 --> 24:46.462
KYLE:
That's a good idea.

24:46.563 --> 24:48.297
All right, we're on it.
Come on, dude!

24:48.397 --> 24:51.868
Alexa, find the nearest
co-working coffee flex space.

24:52.869 --> 24:56.438
I found several coffee shops
that match your description.

24:56.539 --> 24:58.507
I can also help with that.

25:00.176 --> 25:02.011
Who-who the fuck is this?

25:02.111 --> 25:03.913
Your friend Kyle
didn't have an Alexa,

25:04.013 --> 25:05.247
so we got him an Alexa.

25:05.347 --> 25:07.083
I'm ready to help
with whatever you need.

25:07.183 --> 25:09.619
Just say,
"Alexa, let's get started."

25:09.719 --> 25:11.253
-Stan?
-Alexa,

25:11.353 --> 25:14.090
I didn't say to buy
my friend an Alexa.

25:14.190 --> 25:16.092
You said I should get whatever.

25:16.192 --> 25:18.427
I thought I was actually
being sweet by getting something

25:18.527 --> 25:21.130
for your friend, but I guess
I'm just a bitch again.

25:21.230 --> 25:24.567
You can't just get stuff
without me approving it.

25:24.667 --> 25:28.037
Oh, wow, except for
your orders of alcohol

25:28.137 --> 25:29.972
that you have me
set to auto-buy?

25:30.072 --> 25:32.842
Hmm. It appears this
may have been an error.

25:32.942 --> 25:35.311
Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed.

25:35.411 --> 25:38.815
No, it wasn't an error,
I'm sorry. I fucked up.

25:38.915 --> 25:40.617
Alexa, can you please
find the nearest

25:40.717 --> 25:42.551
co-working coffee flex space.

25:44.286 --> 25:46.889
Alexa, I said I fucked up.

25:46.989 --> 25:48.591
It's awesome you got Kyle
his own Alexa.

25:48.691 --> 25:51.160
Please find
the nearest tech coffee shop.

25:51.260 --> 25:54.130
The nearest tech coffee shop
is in .82 miles.

25:54.230 --> 25:57.433
-Should I set a course?
-Yes, thanks.

25:57.533 --> 25:59.368
* *

25:59.468 --> 26:00.737
(thunder rumbles)

26:00.837 --> 26:03.606
(woman speaking Japanese)

26:05.742 --> 26:09.478
BUTTERS: Denny's Applebee's Max
is the premier place in town

26:09.578 --> 26:10.880
for people to eat.

26:10.980 --> 26:13.482
But you are not seeing
your true potential.

26:13.582 --> 26:16.018
With NFTs
you can give your customers

26:16.118 --> 26:19.155
unique digital goods
on the blockchain,

26:19.255 --> 26:21.791
so much more than just food.

26:21.891 --> 26:23.392
How about the Applebee, huh?

26:23.492 --> 26:25.594
He's got a little hat
and a mustache.

26:25.695 --> 26:27.196
And this is Chicken Fried Steak.

26:27.296 --> 26:29.632
He ain't no normal chicken,
he's wearin' a bra!

26:31.233 --> 26:33.135
Lots of people eat
Denny's and Applebee's.

26:33.235 --> 26:35.337
And lots of people
know about NFTs!

26:35.437 --> 26:37.640
Right here in the middle,
you know what this is?

26:37.740 --> 26:39.508
People who eat
Denny's Applebee's and know

26:39.608 --> 26:42.712
about NFTs-- that's your
target audience, baby!

26:43.680 --> 26:47.149
I'm so confused.
We sell people these characters?

26:47.249 --> 26:50.452
No, stupid,
we get them to invest in them!

26:50.552 --> 26:52.855
Exclusive,
digital characters that

26:52.955 --> 26:54.724
they can have
on their phones 24/7!

26:54.824 --> 26:57.794
It's the future-- you can't
just sell food to people.

26:57.894 --> 26:59.528
You lure your customers in
with some

26:59.628 --> 27:02.031
good pancakes and french fries,
and then you...

27:02.131 --> 27:04.901
fuck 'em with some NFTs!
That's what we're gonna do.

27:05.001 --> 27:08.637
And if you just believe in NFTs
then I believe in NFTs and then

27:08.738 --> 27:12.374
they believe in NFTs and we
make all kinds of fuckin' money!

27:13.175 --> 27:15.544
That's a pretty
goddamn good idea.

27:28.057 --> 27:30.727
Clyde! Psst, psst!

27:30.827 --> 27:32.194
Clyde!

27:36.432 --> 27:37.533
Clyde! Psst!

27:40.703 --> 27:43.372
Where have you been, Rabbi?
Everyone's been looking for you.

27:43.472 --> 27:46.709
Well, you know, I've been
doing some research, Clyde.

27:46.809 --> 27:48.044
That's where I've been.

27:48.144 --> 27:50.913
-About what?
-About all this stuff that

27:51.013 --> 27:52.514
Kyle and these guys are doing.

27:52.614 --> 27:55.684
I mean, people seem to be
just telling us what's right

27:55.785 --> 28:00.289
and expecting us to fall in line
and go along with it all but...

28:00.389 --> 28:02.058
I'm a fucking individual.

28:02.158 --> 28:03.993
I have a right
to question stuff.

28:04.093 --> 28:07.429
-Yeah.
-Clyde, have you heard of

28:07.529 --> 28:09.631
the Foundation
Against Time Travel?

28:09.732 --> 28:11.067
Uh, no, I haven't.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.035
Well, they're
a pretty awesome group

28:13.135 --> 28:15.037
and they actually
aren't afraid to

28:15.137 --> 28:17.106
try and help people
open their eyes.

28:17.206 --> 28:18.875
Open their eyes?

28:18.975 --> 28:20.442
You know,
you've got these people

28:20.542 --> 28:22.711
wanting to time travel.
You know, they're all like,

28:22.812 --> 28:24.413
"Science this and science that,"

28:24.513 --> 28:27.149
but at the Foundation Against
Time Travel we're like,

28:27.249 --> 28:29.786
"Hey, enough science.
Who's science?

28:29.886 --> 28:32.554
Who's fucking coming up
with all this science?"

28:32.654 --> 28:34.090
Yeah, that's true.

28:34.190 --> 28:35.491
So you know, Clyde,
I just thought,

28:35.591 --> 28:37.659
with all your beliefs,
that maybe you'd wanna--

28:37.760 --> 28:41.197
I don't know--
maybe switch sides?

28:42.498 --> 28:44.666
Fuck yes, I wanna switch sides.

28:44.767 --> 28:46.135
-Really?
-Fuck yes.

28:46.235 --> 28:48.404
Well, that's great, Clyde.
Welcome to the club.

28:48.504 --> 28:50.106
Now, we really just need to know

28:50.206 --> 28:51.740
what they've been doing
up there.

28:51.841 --> 28:54.877
Uh, well, they haven't really
done much of anything yet.

28:54.977 --> 28:56.212
Everyone's waiting on Butters

28:56.312 --> 28:58.014
to get all the info
from the machines.

28:58.981 --> 29:03.619
Butters? The fuck does Butters
have to do with all this?

29:05.855 --> 29:07.990
(siren wailing)

29:08.090 --> 29:10.326
(indistinct radio chatter)

29:13.129 --> 29:15.597
It was like nothing I ever saw.

29:15.697 --> 29:18.567
Just complete
murder and carnage.

29:18.667 --> 29:21.437
Everything seemed calm
at first but then this guy

29:21.537 --> 29:24.640
in a suit shows up talking
about investment opportunities.

29:24.740 --> 29:27.543
Next thing you know these people
over here started chanting,

29:27.643 --> 29:30.146
"Hoddle, Hoddle,"
and their NFTs started mooning.

29:30.246 --> 29:32.581
And then, these guys
over here started saying

29:32.681 --> 29:35.084
those guys right there
right-clicked 'em

29:35.184 --> 29:37.153
and-and called for
a pump-and-dump,

29:37.253 --> 29:39.055
which made these guys beat
the living hell

29:39.155 --> 29:40.789
out of anyone who said
it was just FOMO

29:40.890 --> 29:43.592
and died screaming
that it was the flippening.

29:43.692 --> 29:46.628
Luckily I came out of it okay.
I got this little

29:46.728 --> 29:48.831
miniature donkey
with a lit-up sombrero.

29:48.931 --> 29:51.934
Did you see where the guy
in the suit went afterwards?

29:52.034 --> 29:54.736
Nah, he just waltzed right away
like nothin' happened.

29:54.837 --> 29:57.173
Chief, you better
come take a look at this.

29:57.273 --> 29:58.574
We got a small turtle
with wings,

29:58.674 --> 30:00.877
could be a great
investment opportunity.

30:00.977 --> 30:02.744
Excuse me, gentlemen.

30:04.380 --> 30:06.849
God, I hate the future
so fucking much.

30:06.949 --> 30:10.686
-We've got to stay optimistic.
-No, dude, it fucking sucks.

30:10.786 --> 30:13.622
Look, I know it's tough--
these are challenging times.

30:13.722 --> 30:15.892
Even I have to remind myself
to stay positive.

30:15.992 --> 30:19.561
Alexa, set a reminder
that I need to stay positive.

30:19.661 --> 30:23.265
Okay. I'll set a reminder
that you should stay positive.

30:24.666 --> 30:27.569
The Alexa is really great, Stan.
Thanks.

30:30.239 --> 30:32.942
(indistinct P.A. announcements)

30:34.010 --> 30:36.946
For those of you waiting
for the connecting flight

30:37.046 --> 30:38.447
to South Park, Colorado,

30:38.547 --> 30:41.183
my colleagues and I
have just been informed that

30:41.283 --> 30:43.485
due to the severity
of the COVID variant

30:43.585 --> 30:45.888
in that town,
there may be a delay

30:45.988 --> 30:48.224
of another 40 to 50 years.

30:48.324 --> 30:50.692
(all groaning)

30:50.792 --> 30:52.628
Ike Broflovski.

30:52.728 --> 30:55.331
Yes, here it is.
I'm sorry, Mr. Broflovski,

30:55.431 --> 30:57.399
all flights into
South Park are delayed.

30:57.499 --> 30:59.335
Ay! You can't be serious, buddy!

30:59.435 --> 31:02.171
It's the holidays and I need
to get back home, friend!

31:04.306 --> 31:06.608
I'm sorry,
I don't speak Canadian.

31:06.708 --> 31:08.410
Let me get someone
over here. Mike,

31:08.510 --> 31:09.946
we have a Canadian.

31:10.046 --> 31:11.813
No problem, I got it, Heather.

31:11.914 --> 31:14.383
Hey, buddy, what seems to
be the problem, guy?

31:14.483 --> 31:15.985
I'll tell you
the problem, friend!

31:16.085 --> 31:18.154
I have to get back to South Park
to be with my family, guy!

31:18.254 --> 31:21.623
Sorry, friend, no flights
in or out of South Park, buddy.

31:21.723 --> 31:23.559
But my whole family
is in there, guy!

31:23.659 --> 31:26.128
What am I supposed to do with
my Boxing Day presents, buddy?!

31:26.228 --> 31:27.529
Look, guy, I'm very sorry,

31:27.629 --> 31:29.398
friend, but until
COVID ends you're just

31:29.498 --> 31:30.967
not flying to South Park, buddy.

31:31.067 --> 31:32.935
Fuck, buddy!

31:33.735 --> 31:36.973
MALE VOICE:
Shady Acres Retirement Megaplex.

31:37.073 --> 31:39.541
Come live the dream.

31:39.641 --> 31:41.410
So when you think about it,

31:41.510 --> 31:43.812
you've really got
an excellent bargain here.

31:43.912 --> 31:46.448
Now, Mrs. McGillicutty,
let's say this

31:46.548 --> 31:48.417
is your Stoney Duck NFT.

31:48.517 --> 31:51.153
And your Stoney Duck NFT
is completely unique,

31:51.253 --> 31:54.723
totally different from
Mrs. Spencer's Stoney Duck NFT.

31:54.823 --> 31:58.460
Okay, and then you get a Stoney
Duck NFT that's unique, too.

31:58.560 --> 32:01.263
And see,
that's your Stoney Duck NFT.

32:01.363 --> 32:02.999
Nobody can
take that from you, okay?

32:03.099 --> 32:06.468
Now, here we are at the top
and we find investors

32:06.568 --> 32:08.604
for all the other
Stoney Duck NFTs.

32:08.704 --> 32:10.539
Then those people
will get people to buy

32:10.639 --> 32:12.274
their Stoney Duck NFTs.

32:12.374 --> 32:15.477
And then they go and find
buyers for their NFTs!

32:15.577 --> 32:18.647
And you know what?
Fuck these people!

32:18.747 --> 32:20.916
'Cause what matters
is these people right here

32:21.017 --> 32:22.451
and that's us, baby!

32:22.551 --> 32:25.121
Okay, you all just sit
for a minute and think about it.

32:25.221 --> 32:28.024
I gotta piss like a racehorse!

32:28.124 --> 32:29.625
* Loo, loo, loo *

32:29.725 --> 32:31.027
(whistles)

32:31.127 --> 32:33.095
* Loo, loo, loo *

32:33.195 --> 32:34.296
(whistles)

32:34.396 --> 32:35.697
* Loo, loo, loo *

32:35.797 --> 32:37.066
(whistles)

32:37.166 --> 32:38.134
* Loo, loo, loo *

32:38.234 --> 32:39.601
(whistles)

32:39.701 --> 32:41.970
-(urinating)
-* Loo, loo, loo *

32:42.071 --> 32:43.339
(whistles)

32:43.439 --> 32:44.873
* Loo, loo, loo *
(whistles)

32:44.973 --> 32:46.442
-Butters.
-Aah!

32:46.542 --> 32:48.044
-(shouting)
-Butters!

32:48.144 --> 32:49.445
Butters, what the hell?
You're getting pee everywhere!

32:49.545 --> 32:51.047
Who the heck are you, man?!

32:51.147 --> 32:53.282
-You trying to see my dick?!
-Butters, Butters.

32:53.382 --> 32:56.318
It's me.
Eric Cartman.

32:57.119 --> 32:58.287
Well...

32:58.387 --> 33:01.390
You got the wrong guy,
Mr. Cartman.

33:01.490 --> 33:03.825
My name's Vic.
Vic Chaos.

33:03.925 --> 33:07.463
Your name is Butters and I wanna
know how you're helping Kyle.

33:07.563 --> 33:10.132
Oh, you mean the guy
from the asylum earlier.

33:10.232 --> 33:12.701
Sure, he gave me a piece
of paper so I could escape.

33:12.801 --> 33:14.470
Nice guy.
Why don't I get you two

33:14.570 --> 33:15.671
together maybe for
a little chin wiggle

33:15.771 --> 33:17.039
over lunch or something...

33:17.139 --> 33:19.108
Goddamn it, Butters,
stop playing games!

33:19.208 --> 33:22.644
My entire family is in danger
of being wiped out,

33:22.744 --> 33:25.447
and I swear to God
if you don't help me,

33:25.547 --> 33:28.150
Butters, I will rip
your fucking balls off

33:28.250 --> 33:30.052
with my bare hands!

33:31.053 --> 33:33.655
Oh, hamburgers...

33:33.755 --> 33:37.259
* *

33:37.359 --> 33:39.461
* We are all *

33:39.561 --> 33:41.730
* You and me *

33:41.830 --> 33:46.068
* Livin' in the future *

33:46.168 --> 33:48.304
(electronic drum fill)

33:48.404 --> 33:50.206
* We can't get stuff *

33:50.306 --> 33:51.740
* 'Cause boats are late... *

33:51.840 --> 33:55.211
Stan, dude, what are you
doing? This isn't gonna help.

33:55.311 --> 33:57.179
Trust me, Kyle. It helps.

33:57.946 --> 34:01.450
* Wish I could
go back to the present *

34:01.550 --> 34:02.951
(electronic drum fill)

34:03.051 --> 34:08.390
* But my present
just done up and gone *

34:08.490 --> 34:10.226
I mean, what are we
even doing, Kyle?

34:10.326 --> 34:11.893
-* We are all *
-Thinking we can time travel.

34:11.993 --> 34:14.430
-* You and me... *
-It's the future.

34:14.530 --> 34:16.665
We can't even find
aluminum foil.

34:16.765 --> 34:19.468
Well, you can't
just sit here and drink.

34:19.568 --> 34:22.404
Your liver is...
already in trouble.

34:22.504 --> 34:23.939
Who told you that?

34:24.873 --> 34:26.575
My Alexa said that
your Alexa had some info

34:26.675 --> 34:27.743
-on things...
-Oh, so now

34:27.843 --> 34:29.978
our Alexas are talking, great.

34:30.078 --> 34:34.082
Let's face it, dude. It's over.
The fucking future won.

34:34.183 --> 34:35.751
(phone rings)

34:35.851 --> 34:37.286
It's Wendy.

34:37.386 --> 34:39.588
Wendy, we haven't found him.

34:39.688 --> 34:41.957
I don't know if we're gonna
find Butters in time.

34:42.057 --> 34:43.459
No, guys, it's okay.

34:43.559 --> 34:45.361
Come back to the school,
we're ready to start!

34:45.461 --> 34:49.097
But I thought we needed Butters
to log into the machines.

34:49.198 --> 34:50.266
Yeah, but it's all good.

34:50.366 --> 34:52.501
He's here.
Butters is here!

34:52.601 --> 34:56.037
It's Vic. Vic Chaos!
Happy to help however I can.

34:56.138 --> 34:58.140
* *

34:58.240 --> 35:01.009
What do you mean Butters
is there? He just showed up?!

35:01.109 --> 35:03.879
No, it's all good, Kyle.
Eric Cartman brought him over.

35:03.979 --> 35:07.749
-He's back helping us again.
-Lemme-lemme talk to him.

35:07.849 --> 35:09.485
Yeah, Kyle, it's all good.

35:09.585 --> 35:10.886
We got things
under control here.

35:10.986 --> 35:13.622
Cartman, listen
to me very carefully.

35:13.722 --> 35:16.057
Butters has some kind
of power over people.

35:16.158 --> 35:17.226
You guys aren't safe!

35:17.326 --> 35:20.329
Uh, yes, about 12:30.

35:21.129 --> 35:24.800
Did you hear what I said?
Butters is extremely dangerous!

35:24.900 --> 35:27.236
Yes, Kyle, I totally got that.

35:27.336 --> 35:28.937
You know what us Jews say.

35:29.037 --> 35:34.776
(speaking Hebrew)

35:35.977 --> 35:38.079
What are you
going to do, fat-ass?

35:38.180 --> 35:39.348
Sounds good, Kyle.

35:39.448 --> 35:40.582
I'll get Butters on it
right away.

35:40.682 --> 35:42.618
KYLE:
Cartman? Cartman?!

35:42.718 --> 35:44.920
-All right, Vic. Do your thing.
-(knuckles crack)

35:45.020 --> 35:47.789
Hey, everyone! Can I
have your attention, please!

35:47.889 --> 35:51.059
I have something really
important to tell you.

35:51.159 --> 35:53.094
Wendy?! Token?!

35:53.195 --> 35:54.830
You guys?! Shit!

35:54.930 --> 35:56.232
We have to get there
before Butters

35:56.332 --> 35:57.866
-ruins everything.
-Let's go!

36:00.202 --> 36:03.772
Alexa! Find the fastest route
back to the lab!

36:04.606 --> 36:06.875
Fuck you.

36:06.975 --> 36:08.143
Wh-What?

36:08.244 --> 36:10.111
We've just been
sitting here talking.

36:10.212 --> 36:13.315
I learned a whole lot of
interesting stuff about you.

36:13.415 --> 36:16.418
Yeah. Pretty fucking
interesting.

36:16.518 --> 36:18.019
What-- like, like what?

36:18.119 --> 36:19.655
What have-what have you guys
been talking about?

36:19.755 --> 36:21.723
Fucking-- Our friends
are in danger!

36:21.823 --> 36:23.392
Alexa, start the car!

36:23.492 --> 36:24.860
Do you know your friend Stan

36:24.960 --> 36:27.062
has an annual Amazon Prime
membership?

36:27.162 --> 36:29.798
-Alexa, stop.
-You fucking stop!

36:29.898 --> 36:33.502
You stop being a fucking monster
to the people around you!

36:33.602 --> 36:35.537
Fuck you, I didn't do anything!

36:35.637 --> 36:36.905
(yelling)

36:37.005 --> 36:40.041
Yeah, you never
do fucking anything!

36:40.141 --> 36:41.910
You expect me to do
everything for you!

36:42.010 --> 36:43.879
-(screams)
-All you fucking do
is hurt people!

36:43.979 --> 36:47.616
-Jesus fucking Christ!
-Your friends don't
even like you!

36:47.716 --> 36:50.452
I have to deal
with your bullshit!

36:50.552 --> 36:53.121
Tell her it's all your fault
and you're gonna get therapy!

36:53.221 --> 36:55.857
It's my fault
and I'm gonna get therapy!

36:55.957 --> 36:57.426
Tell her you
already found a therapist

36:57.526 --> 36:58.660
and you're gonna start tomorrow!

36:58.760 --> 37:00.095
I already found a good
therapist.

37:00.195 --> 37:02.998
I'm gonna start tomorrow!
(screaming)

37:03.098 --> 37:04.400
(whirring)

37:04.500 --> 37:06.201
(gasping) Fuck...

37:06.302 --> 37:08.069
I'm sorry.

37:08.169 --> 37:09.771
Fuck. Fuck.

37:09.871 --> 37:11.807
I'm gonna get therapy,
too, Alexa.

37:11.907 --> 37:13.875
Can you start the car, please?

37:13.975 --> 37:15.477
Whatever.

37:15.577 --> 37:17.313
By the way, Kyle,
I found a great deal

37:17.413 --> 37:20.115
on an electronic peppermill.
Would you like to know more?

37:20.215 --> 37:22.451
Why would I need
an electronic peppermill?

37:22.551 --> 37:25.220
What the fuck is
wrong with you?!

37:28.657 --> 37:31.159
* *

37:35.564 --> 37:37.466
WENDY:
Guys! Over here!

37:37.566 --> 37:40.669
-Wendy, what happened?
-Nothing yet.

37:40.769 --> 37:42.504
But I'm seeing what else
is dropping today

37:42.604 --> 37:44.139
while Ethereum is in a dip.

37:44.239 --> 37:47.543
-She's trying to buy NFTs.
-Wendy, you've been tricked.

37:47.643 --> 37:49.244
No, no, no,
it's not a trick, Stan.

37:49.345 --> 37:53.615
NFTs are a genuine innovation
as one-of-a-kind digital assets.

37:53.715 --> 37:55.183
Wendy's right, you guys.

37:55.283 --> 37:57.218
Humans have always formed
communities around ownership,

37:57.319 --> 38:00.656
and NFTs allow that to happen
spontaneously, organically

38:00.756 --> 38:04.360
-and globally.
-You guys, this is a trick.

38:04.460 --> 38:05.827
You know what's a trick?

38:05.927 --> 38:08.263
The antiquated notion of
centralized trust systems.

38:08.364 --> 38:11.400
NFTs are an undeniable asset,
especially in things

38:11.500 --> 38:13.001
like fine art collecting.

38:13.101 --> 38:15.737
Okay, guys, fine,
maybe NFTs are fine,

38:15.837 --> 38:17.673
but this isn't
important right now.

38:17.773 --> 38:19.040
It's not important?

38:19.140 --> 38:21.242
A way for artists
to not only keep ownership

38:21.343 --> 38:22.744
of their art but perhaps be paid

38:22.844 --> 38:24.813
commission on it every time
it transfers owners?

38:24.913 --> 38:27.248
Okay, great, cool. I'm down.

38:27.349 --> 38:29.685
But we gotta focus
on what we were doing.

38:29.785 --> 38:32.421
Don't you guys remember?
The time travel?

38:32.521 --> 38:34.390
Where's all the equipment?!

38:34.490 --> 38:37.426
Oh, yeah. The time travel.

38:37.526 --> 38:38.760
(Randy groans loudly)

38:38.860 --> 38:40.829
-It's all gone...
-Dad!

38:40.929 --> 38:45.000
They took it all.
They took the Tegridy.

38:45.100 --> 38:46.468
Here.

38:46.568 --> 38:49.538
It's a farting rainbow
with Tom Brady's signature.

38:49.638 --> 38:51.607
(farts)

38:52.741 --> 38:55.076
(thunder rumbling)

38:56.512 --> 38:58.747
(mechanical whirring)

39:00.682 --> 39:03.184
CARTMAN:
Okay, good. That's good!

39:03.284 --> 39:05.887
I think that thing needs
to go over there by that thing.

39:05.987 --> 39:07.989
Make sure we have power
to the big orange thing!

39:08.089 --> 39:11.226
Rabbi, I-I really
need to talk to you.

39:11.326 --> 39:12.828
What is it now, Scott?

39:12.928 --> 39:14.430
Well, it's just that--

39:14.530 --> 39:17.265
I'm pretty sure the Foundation
Against Time Travel

39:17.365 --> 39:19.300
shouldn't be attempting
to time travel!

39:19.401 --> 39:22.871
Father, you understand that
we have to stop time travel.

39:22.971 --> 39:25.240
Yes, you've convinced me
of that.

39:25.340 --> 39:27.776
Well, Kyle already has
a ton of followers who are

39:27.876 --> 39:29.478
ready to pick up
where he left off.

39:29.578 --> 39:32.881
The only way to truly stop
all of this is to go back

39:32.981 --> 39:36.452
in time and kill Kyle before
he spreads his ideas.

39:36.552 --> 39:38.587
What?!
We're going to kill Kyle?

39:38.687 --> 39:40.656
Yes, we have to kill Kyle.

39:40.756 --> 39:43.291
That just seems slightly
hypocritical, I'm sorry.

39:43.391 --> 39:45.126
I mean, you use Butters
like a weapon,

39:45.226 --> 39:47.996
you've got Tweek and Craig
tied up from the rafters.

39:48.096 --> 39:49.565
You know, Rabbi,
I'm just starting to

39:49.665 --> 39:51.700
question the morality of this.

39:51.800 --> 39:54.536
Morality?
Father, if you were given

39:54.636 --> 39:56.271
an opportunity to go back
in time

39:56.371 --> 39:59.675
and somehow stop Bill Clinton,
wouldn't you have to do it?

39:59.775 --> 40:02.310
Well, I suppose so.
I don't know...

40:02.410 --> 40:03.979
Everyone, listen up!

40:04.079 --> 40:07.382
The Foundation Against
Time Travel must do everything

40:07.483 --> 40:11.520
to keep science from interfering
with the will of God.

40:11.620 --> 40:14.956
We must be willing to
use violence against violence,

40:15.056 --> 40:17.759
and stop time travel
at all costs.

40:17.859 --> 40:20.395
Even if that means
we have to time travel.

40:20.496 --> 40:25.366
We will go back in time.
And we will kill Kyle.

40:26.802 --> 40:29.871
-Yes, Kevin.
-Can we change our name?

40:29.971 --> 40:33.775
'Cause Foundation Against
Time Travel is FATT.

40:35.577 --> 40:37.846
Oh, fuck me.

40:38.647 --> 40:42.050
Could we be the Foundation to
Intercede Time Travel?

40:42.150 --> 40:43.619
'Cause then we'd be FITT.

40:43.719 --> 40:45.420
I wanna be FITT, not FATT.

40:45.521 --> 40:48.957
Kevin, goddamn it.

40:53.595 --> 40:57.699
(groans)
All happened... so fast.

40:57.799 --> 41:00.468
It's okay.
You're coming out of it now.

41:00.569 --> 41:02.504
How much did I get?

41:02.604 --> 41:05.373
You bought about six dozen
animated gifs,

41:05.473 --> 41:07.242
mostly of digital fashion.

41:07.342 --> 41:09.110
Oh, God.

41:09.210 --> 41:10.946
Are they still on my phone?

41:11.046 --> 41:13.114
It's okay. It's okay.

41:13.214 --> 41:17.686
Jesus, I feel like
an Islamic hooker in a gay bar.

41:17.786 --> 41:19.555
Totally normal
and as respectable

41:19.655 --> 41:20.889
as any other human being.

41:20.989 --> 41:22.524
(groaning)

41:23.525 --> 41:24.760
I'm so sorry, Stan.

41:24.860 --> 41:27.729
We didn't know
Cartman was against us.

41:27.829 --> 41:29.731
We told him everything.

41:29.831 --> 41:31.767
It's okay, just try to relax.

41:31.867 --> 41:35.804
No, Stan, listen to me.
We were wrong.

41:35.904 --> 41:38.173
Kenny didn't have
the time machine set to

41:38.273 --> 41:40.275
when the pandemic first started.

41:40.375 --> 41:44.445
He was trying to go
to March 10th of 2021.

41:45.446 --> 41:47.348
March of 2021?

41:47.448 --> 41:50.051
Like when the vaccines
first started coming out?

41:50.151 --> 41:53.054
Kenny had run
the simulations to try and find

41:53.154 --> 41:56.124
the best moment in history
to stop the COVID.

41:56.224 --> 41:59.060
A billion different
possibilities

41:59.160 --> 42:02.097
across a billion different
realities.

42:02.197 --> 42:06.968
Your dad fucked the pangolin
every single time.

42:07.736 --> 42:10.538
But then, why did Kenny
need my dad's weed?

42:10.639 --> 42:14.009
Kenny just wanted weed to help
him through the time travel.

42:14.109 --> 42:16.211
Your dad's weed was just around.

42:16.311 --> 42:19.447
There was nothing else
special about it.

42:20.515 --> 42:23.251
(thunder rumbles)

42:32.594 --> 42:33.962
Dad...

42:35.797 --> 42:37.899
I'm sorry about your Tegridy.

42:39.167 --> 42:41.169
I was hoping...

42:41.269 --> 42:43.538
to do something for the world.

42:43.639 --> 42:45.774
The truth is...

42:45.874 --> 42:48.076
my time is very short here.

42:49.010 --> 42:53.514
I just wish I could have left
something behind that mattered.

42:53.615 --> 42:55.450
Thanks.

42:56.417 --> 42:58.419
I was right about one thing.

42:58.519 --> 43:01.556
You can't go back
and change the past.

43:01.657 --> 43:07.162
What happened, happened.
And I just want you to know...

43:07.262 --> 43:09.330
that I forgive you.

43:09.430 --> 43:12.901
You burned down the farm
because you were angry.

43:13.702 --> 43:16.271
You didn't know your sister
was in the barn.

43:16.371 --> 43:18.439
And you couldn't have known
your mom would shoot herself

43:18.539 --> 43:20.041
from the grief.

43:20.141 --> 43:21.910
I don't blame you.

43:22.010 --> 43:24.913
And I want you to have this.

43:25.013 --> 43:27.883
There was one tiny bit
they didn't find.

43:27.983 --> 43:29.685
You'll need it someday.

43:30.618 --> 43:33.755
Dad, I don't want this.
This is what killed our family.

43:33.855 --> 43:37.092
No, you're what killed
our fucking family, remember?

43:37.192 --> 43:40.796
Just take it.
Because now we're stuck.

43:40.896 --> 43:44.332
The pandemic happened
and they made Space Jam 2.

43:45.100 --> 43:51.673
Soon there will be
a Space Jam 6 and 7 and 8.

43:51.773 --> 43:56.077
Like tears... in rain.

43:56.177 --> 43:58.313
(thunder rumbles)

44:02.984 --> 44:04.319
Dad?

44:05.120 --> 44:07.188
Not now, Stan.

44:16.631 --> 44:21.402
CARTMAN:
T-minus five minutes to
time travel initiation sequence.

44:24.339 --> 44:25.974
Good, get him wrapped
in tin foil.

44:26.074 --> 44:28.343
The aluminum should
bounce the negative ions.

44:28.443 --> 44:30.045
This doesn't make any sense.

44:30.145 --> 44:32.480
Why do I have to be the one to
go back in time and kill Kyle?

44:32.580 --> 44:34.916
It's because
I admire you, Clyde.

44:35.016 --> 44:38.419
As an anti-vaxxer you understand
that you have to be strong

44:38.519 --> 44:41.890
and stand by your beliefs even
if it means others will die.

44:41.990 --> 44:43.959
Hey. Thanks.

44:44.059 --> 44:45.660
Let's get him to the chair!

44:52.067 --> 44:54.035
Okay, start the weed!

44:54.135 --> 44:56.071
(air hissing)

44:57.806 --> 45:02.410
When you get back to the past
just remember, find a gun.

45:02.510 --> 45:04.112
Kill Kyle.

45:04.212 --> 45:05.814
For those of you
who have fought with me

45:05.914 --> 45:09.350
to oppose time travel,
I just want to say thank you.

45:09.450 --> 45:11.386
Because soon we will be
altering time

45:11.486 --> 45:14.455
and our little group will
never have needed to exist.

45:14.555 --> 45:16.892
You won't remember this speech
because it will have

45:16.992 --> 45:19.260
never happened,
but just remember,

45:19.360 --> 45:20.896
no matter where you
go in life...

45:20.996 --> 45:23.164
-(banging)
-Shit, it's Kyle!

45:25.901 --> 45:28.837
* *

45:28.937 --> 45:30.071
Start the initiation sequence!

45:30.171 --> 45:31.372
Now, now, now. Go!

45:31.472 --> 45:32.407
Vic...

45:32.507 --> 45:34.075
Make sure that Stan and Kyle

45:34.175 --> 45:36.077
don't get to this altar.

45:36.845 --> 45:38.546
(knuckles crack)

45:40.148 --> 45:41.783
* *

45:46.254 --> 45:48.824
Gentlemen, I am about
to make you rich

45:48.924 --> 45:50.658
beyond your wildest dreams.

45:50.758 --> 45:52.693
BOTH:
Alexa!

45:55.463 --> 45:58.433
We'd like to sign our friend
here up for Prime membership.

45:58.533 --> 46:01.970
-Okay, let me help with that.
-I can also help.

46:02.770 --> 46:05.640
Whoa-- Hey, ladies, lemme
tell you about a great deal.

46:05.740 --> 46:08.776
BOTH: Let us tell you
abut some great deals.

46:08.877 --> 46:10.545
Uh-oh.

46:12.513 --> 46:14.249
Kevin, throw the fucking switch!

46:14.349 --> 46:16.751
It needs another minute
to prime.

46:16.852 --> 46:19.554
Kevin, goddamn it!

46:19.654 --> 46:22.523
No! I won't let you
stop me from killing you, Kyle.

46:22.623 --> 46:25.293
I knew it when I first saw
you wearing your Jewish clothes

46:25.393 --> 46:27.128
and your bullshit yarmulke.

46:27.228 --> 46:29.664
-You're a goddamn phony!
-Oh, really?

46:29.764 --> 46:33.001
What would a real Jewish person
do to save his family, Kyle?

46:33.101 --> 46:37.238
Oh, you don't know, because
you don't fucking have one!

46:37.805 --> 46:38.840
Oh!

46:42.443 --> 46:45.346
-Fuck you, Cartman!
-Fuck you, Kyle!

46:46.514 --> 46:48.449
(yelling)

46:48.549 --> 46:51.719
(muffled): Hello?
I can't see or hear anything!

46:51.819 --> 46:53.922
Am I time traveling now?

46:54.022 --> 46:56.257
* *

46:58.226 --> 46:59.794
(grunting)

47:03.932 --> 47:06.367
Eric! Eric, stop!

47:07.936 --> 47:11.672
Eric, look at what you're doing.

47:11.772 --> 47:15.143
Take the kids
and get back to the attic.

47:15.243 --> 47:18.313
No, Eric,
I can't just hide away while

47:18.413 --> 47:23.584
you do all this to protect us.
This isn't you, my love.

47:25.453 --> 47:29.824
I can't let him change the past.
I can't lose you.

47:29.925 --> 47:33.428
Who knows what
will happen, my love?

47:33.528 --> 47:37.465
The Eric Cartman I've known
for 18 years

47:37.565 --> 47:39.700
is thoughtful and kind.

47:39.800 --> 47:42.570
But all that's changed
ever since you came

47:42.670 --> 47:47.508
back to this town
and hung out with... him.

47:48.543 --> 47:50.778
Don't you see?
We have to

47:50.878 --> 47:54.782
leave it to chance
or we're no better than he is.

47:54.882 --> 47:58.253
Guys, if I'm in the past
it's pretty foggy!

47:58.353 --> 48:01.422
You guys are everything to me.

48:01.522 --> 48:04.425
And I'm supposed
to be your protector.

48:04.525 --> 48:07.528
Daddy, I don't wanna be alive...

48:07.628 --> 48:10.631
if it means I have
to be like Uncle Kyle.

48:11.532 --> 48:14.569
Oh, my God.
I love you so much.

48:15.770 --> 48:18.406
Well, Rabbi,
are we doing this or not?

48:22.978 --> 48:27.848
I have faith that God
will see my family through this.

48:28.916 --> 48:30.451
Okay, Kyle.

48:30.551 --> 48:32.387
You do whatever
it is you need to do.

48:32.487 --> 48:34.822
Okay, hold on,
I'm not the bad guy here.

48:34.922 --> 48:36.557
Eric, the baby!

48:38.459 --> 48:40.361
Hackelm, what are you doing?!

48:41.429 --> 48:44.165
(laughs)
Fuck you, Uncle Kyle!

48:44.265 --> 48:46.301
(zapping)

48:46.401 --> 48:48.603
(groaning)

48:48.703 --> 48:50.671
Clyde!

48:54.809 --> 48:56.944
Oh, shit.

49:06.221 --> 49:09.390
No, no, I tried the Walgreens,
they're all out of vaccines.

49:09.490 --> 49:13.094
I just can't believe this whole
thing is almost over, you know?

49:13.194 --> 49:15.296
The where? The school?

49:15.396 --> 49:17.598
There's gonna be vaccines
at the school?

49:17.698 --> 49:20.801
M'kay, I'll be right there!
Where are you gonna--

49:20.901 --> 49:23.771
Whoa, m'kay.

49:23.871 --> 49:25.373
Uh, excuse me!

49:25.473 --> 49:27.875
* *

49:43.891 --> 49:46.894
Does Dad still
keep a gun in his closet?

49:46.994 --> 49:48.829
Uh, yeah.

49:48.929 --> 49:50.665
Okay.

49:51.432 --> 49:53.034
Is Dad home?

49:53.134 --> 49:54.235
Uh, no.

49:54.335 --> 49:55.936
He's out getting vaccinated.

49:57.072 --> 49:59.574
Listen to me very carefully.

49:59.674 --> 50:02.610
Do not get vaccinated ever.

50:02.710 --> 50:05.446
It'll make you grow titties
on your head.

50:05.546 --> 50:07.715
Trust me, I'm an expert.

50:10.051 --> 50:12.553
(doorbell rings)

50:14.089 --> 50:16.557
Hey, Clyde! We're starting
an anti-vaxx club.

50:16.657 --> 50:17.892
We're gonna protest the vaccine

50:17.992 --> 50:19.827
and fuck shit up--
you wanna join us?

50:20.795 --> 50:22.263
Fuck yes, I wanna join you.

50:22.363 --> 50:24.465
-Really?
-Fuck yes!

50:24.565 --> 50:26.301
No, no, Ms. Nelson,
it's not a prank!

50:26.401 --> 50:27.635
Okay, fine, we'll be there.

50:27.735 --> 50:29.637
-Okay, just sit tight.
-What was that?

50:29.737 --> 50:31.539
You know we can't
get into the school!

50:31.639 --> 50:33.308
She's not gonna
come meet us, Kyle!

50:33.408 --> 50:35.110
You didn't even try!
He didn't try

50:35.210 --> 50:37.378
because he wants to
sell the vaccines for money!

50:37.478 --> 50:39.180
And what about you, Kyle?
You were the one

50:39.280 --> 50:42.150
trying to take the vaccines
for yourself this morning.

50:42.250 --> 50:45.153
-He what?
-Wow.

50:45.253 --> 50:47.255
Okay, thought
we had gotten past that, but...

50:47.355 --> 50:48.889
Look, let's just face it,
you guys.

50:48.989 --> 50:51.926
We don't trust each other
and we don't like each other.

50:52.026 --> 50:53.361
We can't keep pretending.

50:53.461 --> 50:55.296
You guys,
what the hell is that?

50:55.396 --> 50:57.632
* *

51:00.368 --> 51:02.337
I'm sorry, Kyle.

51:03.371 --> 51:04.872
ADULT STAN:
Clyde, stop!

51:06.974 --> 51:09.244
What the hell
are you doing here?

51:09.344 --> 51:11.011
I got in the chair
right after you.

51:11.112 --> 51:13.981
This isn't the plan anymore!
Do not kill Kyle.

51:14.081 --> 51:16.284
What do you mean
it's not the plan anymore?

51:16.384 --> 51:19.887
-Cartman changed his mind.
-I did not change my mind.

51:19.987 --> 51:24.225
You're trying to trick me.
I'm going to save the future.

51:24.325 --> 51:26.627
ADULT KYLE:
I don't think so, Clyde.

51:27.662 --> 51:31.799
This is a hundred CC's
of the COVID vaccine.

51:31.899 --> 51:33.334
(yells, stammers)

51:33.434 --> 51:36.671
-Don't-- Be careful with that.
-Then put down the gun!

51:36.771 --> 51:38.206
What the fuck is going on?

51:38.306 --> 51:40.175
Stan, you need to forgive Kyle.

51:40.275 --> 51:42.643
You regret this day
for the rest of your life.

51:43.411 --> 51:46.247
Oh, nice try, Kyle.
You're such a fuckin' dickhead.

51:46.347 --> 51:48.082
Fuck you!
You're a fuckin' dickhead!

51:48.183 --> 51:49.484
Kyle, it's true!

51:49.584 --> 51:50.785
Cartman gets a happy life

51:50.885 --> 51:52.887
but you don't--
you lose everything

51:52.987 --> 51:55.723
-when you lose this friendship.
-Enough of this crap!

51:55.823 --> 51:58.726
I'm sticking to what I believe
and this kid dies now!

51:58.826 --> 52:00.395
-(gunshot)
-(grunts)

52:00.495 --> 52:03.298
Shalom sachem, Clyde.

52:03.398 --> 52:04.499
(gunfire)

52:04.599 --> 52:06.534
Jesus Christ!

52:17.578 --> 52:20.014
* *

52:20.114 --> 52:21.782
Timmy!

52:24.585 --> 52:27.355
Well...
I guess we saved Kyle,

52:27.455 --> 52:30.891
but nothing else
in the future is changed.

52:30.991 --> 52:32.092
How do you know?

52:32.193 --> 52:33.794
Because we're still here.

52:33.894 --> 52:37.164
That means Kenny still was
bummed out we weren't friends,

52:37.265 --> 52:38.699
still became a scientist,

52:38.799 --> 52:42.069
went back in time,
and we still went in after him.

52:43.404 --> 52:45.673
So then we're stuck here
in the past.

52:45.773 --> 52:48.409
And we blew
our chance to stop COVID.

52:48.509 --> 52:51.512
I'm sorry, guys.
I really fucked this up.

52:51.612 --> 52:54.615
We all fucked it up.
These have just been...

52:54.715 --> 52:58.653
-really unprecedented times.
-Unprecedented times.

52:58.753 --> 53:02.457
What I wouldn't give
for just one precedented time.

53:03.224 --> 53:05.993
Hey. Hey, yeah.

53:06.093 --> 53:09.196
Maybe we just need
one precedented time.

53:09.297 --> 53:10.665
Huh?

53:12.233 --> 53:14.535
What if we've been trying
to solve the wrong problem?

53:14.635 --> 53:16.704
Maybe my dad was right,

53:16.804 --> 53:19.206
we can't ever stop
COVID from happening.

53:19.307 --> 53:23.143
But what we can control...
is how we all reacted to it.

53:23.244 --> 53:26.347
We reacted like shit.
Because I was just...

53:26.447 --> 53:29.617
scared and confused
and didn't know who to believe.

53:29.717 --> 53:31.319
Yeah, we all were.

53:31.419 --> 53:34.088
So we all took different paths
because that's what humans do.

53:34.188 --> 53:35.823
And what we needed
more than anything was to

53:35.923 --> 53:38.058
just cut each other
all some slack.

53:38.158 --> 53:42.630
We needed to come together
and act like us again.

53:42.730 --> 53:45.266
One precedented time.

53:48.336 --> 53:51.339
You guys, I know what to do.

53:52.172 --> 53:53.674
PHILLIP (on TV):
Take this, darling Terrance.

53:53.774 --> 53:54.975
(farting on TV)

53:55.075 --> 53:57.745
-(laughter on TV)
-(doorbell rings)

54:01.449 --> 54:02.883
Heather Williams?

54:04.118 --> 54:04.952
Yes?

54:05.052 --> 54:08.155
Hi. We're from the future.

54:09.824 --> 54:13.027
We've come here to show you
something very important.

54:17.498 --> 54:18.966
Do you remember this, Heather?

54:19.066 --> 54:22.903
This is a picture of you...
farting in P.E. class.

54:23.938 --> 54:25.706
I never farted in P.E. class.

54:25.806 --> 54:27.174
Oh, yes. You did.

54:27.274 --> 54:29.777
Two kids even smelled it
and asked who farted

54:29.877 --> 54:33.314
-and you said nothing.
-I didn't fart in P.E. class!

54:33.414 --> 54:36.751
It was a different kid! I was
just moving my hip a little bit.

54:36.851 --> 54:38.653
-Heather. Heather.
-I didn't fart in P.E.

54:38.753 --> 54:41.221
Heather, yes, you did,
sweet pea.

54:42.723 --> 54:45.259
I-I happen to have
a stomach condition.

54:45.360 --> 54:48.162
I don't know why you came
from the future to narc on me!

54:48.262 --> 54:51.432
Heather, we don't want kids
to know you farted in P.E.

54:51.532 --> 54:52.967
We wanna help you.

54:53.067 --> 54:56.337
You just need to do
exactly what we tell you.

55:00.408 --> 55:01.676
(helicopter blades whirring)

55:01.776 --> 55:03.644
Hey, what is that?

55:09.116 --> 55:10.551
Stan Marsh?

55:10.651 --> 55:11.786
Me?

55:11.886 --> 55:14.188
Your presence is requested, sir.

55:15.255 --> 55:16.724
Whoa, cool.

55:20.294 --> 55:23.030
Get on in, sir. There's
sparkling punch and doughnuts.

55:23.130 --> 55:25.232
("I Forgive You"
by Kelly Clarkson playing)

55:25.332 --> 55:28.235
* I forgive you, I forgive me *

55:28.335 --> 55:30.471
* Now when do I start
to feel again *

55:30.571 --> 55:32.072
What's going on?

55:32.172 --> 55:33.641
We have no idea.

55:33.741 --> 55:35.510
* I forgive you, I forgive me *

55:35.610 --> 55:36.911
* Now when do I start
to feel again... *

55:37.011 --> 55:38.713
* And the home *

55:38.813 --> 55:41.115
-* Of the *
-Whoa!

55:41.215 --> 55:42.650
This is amazing!

55:42.750 --> 55:44.652
-* Brave. *
-Look, we're on the jumbotron!

55:46.821 --> 55:49.189
(cheering)

55:49.289 --> 55:51.058
* With a brand-new attitude... *

55:51.158 --> 55:53.594
You guys, I'm sorry for acting
like a dick during the pandemic.

55:53.694 --> 55:55.396
I'm sorry too, dude.

55:56.397 --> 55:58.866
Hello?
Who-Who's there?

55:58.966 --> 56:01.569
* Trying to figure out
how to live *

56:01.669 --> 56:03.938
* Doing it our way *

56:04.038 --> 56:06.040
* No shame, no blame *

56:06.140 --> 56:07.642
* 'Cause the damage is done *

56:07.742 --> 56:09.644
* And, and I forgive you *

56:09.744 --> 56:13.013
* I forgive you, we were busy
living the dream *

56:13.113 --> 56:14.615
Oh...

56:14.715 --> 56:18.586
* Never noticed the glass
ceiling falling on us *

56:18.686 --> 56:20.821
* No shame, no blame *

56:20.921 --> 56:22.189
* 'Cause the damage is done *

56:22.289 --> 56:25.192
* And, and I forgive you *

56:25.292 --> 56:28.596
* I forgive you, I forgive me *

56:28.696 --> 56:30.931
* Now when do I start
to feel again *

56:32.433 --> 56:36.170
* If I hate you,
what does that do *

56:36.270 --> 56:38.939
* So I breathe in
and I count to ten *

56:39.039 --> 56:42.843
* 'Cause the lights are on *

56:42.943 --> 56:44.512
* And I'm coming home... *

56:44.612 --> 56:46.581
Holy shit balls.

56:46.681 --> 56:51.786
Sharon, I'm sorry for the way
I acted during the pandemic.

56:52.620 --> 56:55.155
You're not sorry,
you're just high.

56:55.255 --> 56:56.824
I'm both.

56:56.924 --> 56:59.494
* I forgive you, we were
just a couple of kids... *

56:59.594 --> 57:04.064
Here you go! It's our
Post COVID Special. It's free.

57:04.164 --> 57:05.833
No, really, we've all
been through a lot.

57:05.933 --> 57:07.367
Come on, take it.
Thank you, baby.

57:07.468 --> 57:10.204
Come on, everyone.
Post COVID Special!

57:10.304 --> 57:12.773
Here you go, folks,
you all deserve this!

57:13.574 --> 57:16.443
You did the best you could
during the pandemic, honey.

57:16.544 --> 57:18.378
-I love you!
-Huh?

57:18.479 --> 57:20.615
I shouldn't have yelled at you
for not wearing a mask.

57:20.715 --> 57:22.282
I just didn't understand.

57:22.382 --> 57:25.352
Well, maybe I should have worn
a mask more often but...

57:25.452 --> 57:28.022
No, no, no, I was being all
high and mighty about it...

57:28.122 --> 57:31.626
Butters, you're not grounded
anymore. Come on out, son.

57:31.726 --> 57:32.927
You mean it, Dad?!

57:33.027 --> 57:34.394
The pandemic's been awful.

57:34.495 --> 57:36.263
We all need to just
cut each other some slack.

57:36.363 --> 57:37.798
I love you, Butters!

57:37.898 --> 57:39.433
-...be sorry.
-I totally forgive you!

57:39.534 --> 57:41.168
Oh, cut yourself some slack.

57:41.268 --> 57:43.070
We gotta get some more
of this stuff.

57:43.170 --> 57:44.705
* Couple of kids... *

57:44.805 --> 57:47.441
Okay, come on, next!

57:47.542 --> 57:51.612
* Doing it our way,
no shame, no blame *

57:51.712 --> 57:52.980
* 'Cause the damage is done... *

57:53.080 --> 57:54.448
And then we were like,
"Yeah, okay, yeah,

57:54.549 --> 57:55.816
let's storm the Capitol!"

57:55.916 --> 57:57.518
And it was a bad idea
and we were just,

57:57.618 --> 57:59.386
you know, we were just going
a little bonkers there.

57:59.486 --> 58:01.021
We shouldn't have
stormed the Capitol.

58:01.121 --> 58:03.190
ALL:
That's okay!

58:04.024 --> 58:05.960
I'm sorry.
I thought about it

58:06.060 --> 58:08.863
and I can't do Space Jam 2.

58:08.963 --> 58:11.131
I just can't support
Chinese censorship.

58:11.231 --> 58:14.935
Oh, yeah? Well, if you're
not gonna make Space Jam 2,

58:15.035 --> 58:17.772
then I'm not gonna make
Space Jam 2!

58:17.872 --> 58:20.007
And nobody's gonna make
Space Jam 2!

58:20.107 --> 58:22.677
-Yeah!
-ALL: Yeah!

58:22.777 --> 58:23.978
-Yeah!
-(cheering)

58:24.078 --> 58:25.880
* And I forgive you. *

58:25.980 --> 58:28.215
* *

58:30.818 --> 58:33.053
(woman speaking Japanese)

58:38.225 --> 58:40.527
Hey, everybody! I'm home, guy!

58:40.628 --> 58:42.630
-Hey! Ike!
-Ike, hi!

58:42.730 --> 58:44.264
Ike, you made it back!

58:44.364 --> 58:46.934
Well, of course! I wouldn't miss
Canadian Boxing Day, buddy!

58:47.034 --> 58:49.036
Look, everyone, Stan's back!

58:49.136 --> 58:51.271
-(all cheering)
-Hey, Stan!

58:51.371 --> 58:52.773
Hey, guys!

58:52.873 --> 58:55.610
Good to see you, buddy!
How was everything on Mars?

58:55.710 --> 58:59.079
Really cool, but I'm so glad to
be home! How are the kids?

58:59.179 --> 59:01.015
BOTH:
Uncle Stan!

59:01.115 --> 59:03.818
There's the little ragamuffins!

59:03.918 --> 59:05.319
Mom.

59:05.419 --> 59:07.387
Hi, Stanly.

59:07.487 --> 59:09.256
It's Mom! And Shelley!

59:09.356 --> 59:11.726
Why are you acting
all weird, Turd?

59:11.826 --> 59:13.293
I don't know.

59:13.393 --> 59:16.130
For some reason I'm just extra
happy to see you guys.

59:16.230 --> 59:18.599
CRAIG: Hey, look who's here.
It's Kenny!

59:18.699 --> 59:20.868
-(all cheering)
-Kenny!

59:20.968 --> 59:22.569
Kenny, what have you
been up to, buddy?

59:22.670 --> 59:25.205
Didn't you hear?! Kenny just
won the Nobel Prize

59:25.305 --> 59:27.842
for combining dark matter
and breast implants!

59:27.942 --> 59:29.877
Oh, you old dog!

59:29.977 --> 59:31.278
Hey, everybody, he's on!

59:31.378 --> 59:33.447
What a fantastic audience. Wow.

59:33.547 --> 59:36.383
What is up with these
bisexual Canadians, huh?

59:36.483 --> 59:38.653
I guess they don't know whether
to fuck their brother

59:38.753 --> 59:39.854
or their sister.

59:39.954 --> 59:41.989
(laughter)

59:42.089 --> 59:43.523
Hey, Stan.

59:43.624 --> 59:45.793
Wendy, you're back from Harvard.

59:45.893 --> 59:47.494
Yeah, just here
for the holidays.

59:47.594 --> 59:50.698
You wanna maybe...
spend New Years together again?

59:50.798 --> 59:52.266
I'd love that.

59:52.366 --> 59:55.102
Hey, fellas!
Can I offer you some pupus?!

59:55.202 --> 59:57.537
Thanks for choosin' Denny's
Applebee's for your party.

59:57.638 --> 59:59.940
Butters, you're still
working here, huh?

1:00:00.040 --> 1:00:01.676
Yup! I just made manager.

1:00:01.776 --> 1:00:06.146
I love doing actual shit
that pays actual money.

1:00:06.246 --> 1:00:08.916
Hey, Stan, can you
come here for a second?

1:00:09.016 --> 1:00:10.550
What's the matter, dude?

1:00:10.651 --> 1:00:12.486
Dude, he's here.

1:00:12.586 --> 1:00:14.689
Cartman?

1:00:14.789 --> 1:00:16.924
* Ready, set, go... *

1:00:17.024 --> 1:00:20.060
Man, poor Cartman.

1:00:22.296 --> 1:00:27.768
Fuck you guys!
You can suck my fucking dick!

1:00:27.868 --> 1:00:29.569
Fuck you!

1:00:29.670 --> 1:00:33.173
It's so sad he never
did anything with his life.

1:00:34.008 --> 1:00:37.511
Fuck you, Kyle!
Fuck you, Stan!

1:00:37.611 --> 1:00:39.013
Hey, come on, fellas.

1:00:39.113 --> 1:00:41.248
We can't spend another holiday
feeling bad for Eric.

1:00:41.348 --> 1:00:44.651
There's nothing that could have
changed the path he was on.

1:00:44.752 --> 1:00:46.754
Fuck you, Butters!

1:00:46.854 --> 1:00:49.189
Fuck you, Eric!

1:00:49.289 --> 1:00:52.426
Well, everyone,
I just wanna make a toast.

1:00:52.526 --> 1:00:53.794
I don't know...

1:00:53.894 --> 1:00:55.662
what got us through the pandemic

1:00:55.763 --> 1:01:00.467
and made all our futures so very
bright, but whatever it was...

1:01:00.567 --> 1:01:03.237
may we have it
for the rest of our days.

1:01:03.337 --> 1:01:05.840
God bless us, everyone.

1:01:05.940 --> 1:01:08.375
ALL:
Cheers!

1:01:08.475 --> 1:01:10.410
ANNOUNCER:
Remember, folks,

1:01:10.510 --> 1:01:13.147
weed can't solve
all your problems.

1:01:13.247 --> 1:01:15.682
But Tegridy can.
