[honks]

01:11.916 --> 01:13.166
Meditating again?

01:13.750 --> 01:14.750
Trying.

01:15.250 --> 01:18.916
Gungi taught me, but it doesn't work
for me the way it did for him.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.416
He's a Jedi.

01:20.500 --> 01:21.708
I still like it though.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.416
You wanna try?

01:24.083 --> 01:25.333
No.

01:25.416 --> 01:28.041
I don't enjoy solitude.

01:28.875 --> 01:31.083
I had enough of that on Skako Minor.

01:31.958 --> 01:36.958
If it weren't for this squad,
I'd still be a prisoner there or worse.

01:37.916 --> 01:39.625
Is that what made you join them?

01:39.708 --> 01:40.625
Hmm.

01:40.708 --> 01:44.333
This was where I fit, where I was needed.

01:44.416 --> 01:46.166
We have an incoming transmission.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.250
-[beeping]
-It's Rex.

01:52.333 --> 01:53.333
<i>Hey, boys.</i>

01:53.875 --> 01:57.166
<i>Any chance I could use</i>
<i>your squad's expertise for a mission?</i>

01:58.083 --> 02:01.375
Finally.
I'm tired of waiting around for Cid.

02:01.458 --> 02:03.000
What do you need, Rex?

02:03.083 --> 02:05.666
<i>I'll explain everything</i>
<i>when you get to Coruscant.</i>

02:06.333 --> 02:07.625
Coruscant?

02:08.625 --> 02:10.875
That's a big ask, Captain.

02:10.958 --> 02:12.958
Why? What's on Coruscant?

02:13.041 --> 02:17.708
It is the galactic capital and,
thus, the heart of the Empire.

02:17.791 --> 02:19.625
But the Empire thinks we're dead.

02:20.291 --> 02:21.791
They won't be looking for us.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.708
I'd like to keep it that way.

02:23.791 --> 02:25.500
[Rex] <i>It's a covert mission.</i>

02:25.583 --> 02:28.500
<i>A simple data extraction</i>
<i>but a crucial one.</i>

02:29.000 --> 02:32.208
<i>I'll send over a flight plan</i>
<i>to bypass Imperial security</i>

02:32.291 --> 02:34.458
<i>and coordinates to a safe landing zone.</i>

02:34.541 --> 02:35.666
We're on our way.

02:46.250 --> 02:48.166
We are approaching Coruscant.

02:48.958 --> 02:50.875
Everyone, stay ready.

02:52.083 --> 02:53.333
[<i>Marauder</i> approaching]

03:41.958 --> 03:43.000
Glad you made it.

03:44.375 --> 03:46.541
This is Senator Riyo Chuchi.

03:47.666 --> 03:50.375
These are the special clones
I told you about.

03:52.208 --> 03:53.208
Hello.

03:54.958 --> 03:55.958
Thank you for coming.

03:57.958 --> 03:59.500
Why are we here, Captain?

04:00.750 --> 04:03.666
Inside.
There's something I want you to see.

04:14.666 --> 04:15.833
[Rex] He's an assassin.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.833
His identifying number's been wiped.

04:18.916 --> 04:21.375
I was not aware that was possible.

04:21.916 --> 04:22.916
Who was his target?

04:23.416 --> 04:25.916
A clone contact of mine named Slip.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.916
He said he was in danger.

04:28.000 --> 04:33.166
I came to Coruscant to get him out,
but the assassin got to him first.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.750
Nearly got the senator too.

04:36.875 --> 04:41.666
Why would a clone be targeting
another clone or a senator?

04:41.750 --> 04:42.916
To silence us.

04:43.416 --> 04:46.708
Admiral Rampart has the entire Senate
believing Kamino was lost

04:46.791 --> 04:48.125
to a cataclysmic storm.

04:48.958 --> 04:50.541
Slip witnessed the truth.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.750
I wanted him to testify
to Rampart's crimes.

04:53.833 --> 04:55.750
We were there too, Senator.

04:55.833 --> 04:57.333
I can be your witness.

04:57.416 --> 04:59.708
The Senate won't listen to any of us.

04:59.791 --> 05:00.958
We're deserters.

05:01.041 --> 05:02.041
Hunter's right.

05:02.125 --> 05:03.916
But there's another way
to provide the Senate

05:04.000 --> 05:06.083
with the evidence of the Empire's crimes.

05:07.083 --> 05:10.333
The command log on Rampart's <i>Venator</i>.

05:10.833 --> 05:14.166
Slip made a copy of it
on the ship's backup data banks.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.583
Where's the <i>Venator</i> now?

05:15.666 --> 05:20.791
Being retrofitted at the Imperial shipyard
right here on Coruscant.

05:21.291 --> 05:22.916
Lots of security,

05:23.416 --> 05:24.750
but I know a way in.

05:25.250 --> 05:28.208
Rampart's Defense Recruitment Bill
goes to a vote tomorrow.

05:28.875 --> 05:31.333
We must prove his crimes before it passes.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.333
I'll return to the Senate
and garner support where I can.

05:35.416 --> 05:37.125
You could still be in danger.

05:37.708 --> 05:39.125
Then I must be on the right track.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.166
I can go with her and keep an eye out.

05:41.250 --> 05:45.333
You can't enter the Senate district
without an Imperial security clearance.

05:45.416 --> 05:46.875
That will not be a problem.

05:48.666 --> 05:50.166
Then let's get to work.

05:56.208 --> 05:59.125
So, what exactly does a senator do?

05:59.208 --> 06:02.125
We serve the galaxy.
We act as the voice of the people.

06:03.083 --> 06:05.375
But what does that mean?

06:05.458 --> 06:09.000
Well, where I'm taking you next,
you'll see.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.375
[Rampart] Senator Chuchi.

06:13.458 --> 06:15.500
You seem surprised to see me, Admiral.

06:15.583 --> 06:16.666
Not at all.

06:17.166 --> 06:20.291
I was just making a few preparations
for tomorrow's vote.

06:20.916 --> 06:23.625
Indeed. I am looking forward to it.

06:25.125 --> 06:26.833
If you'll excuse me.

06:33.833 --> 06:37.208
Are you certain the senator
won't be a problem?

06:37.291 --> 06:39.250
I've taken care of it.

06:40.208 --> 06:42.041
There's nothing else she can do.

06:42.916 --> 06:44.291
You had better hope so.

06:44.375 --> 06:46.875
No more delays on this vote, Rampart.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.875
This is where the Senate gathers

06:56.958 --> 07:00.041
to discuss many pressing issues
and legislation.

07:00.125 --> 07:02.291
Where the future of the galaxy is decided.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.375
For better or worse.

07:05.291 --> 07:06.750
Wow.

07:08.291 --> 07:11.875
[Chuchi] Each pod belongs to the numerous
representatives and delegates.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.541
Which one belongs to the clones?

07:15.291 --> 07:17.750
Clones do not have representation
in the Senate.

07:18.416 --> 07:19.416
They never have.

07:19.916 --> 07:20.916
Why not?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.500
We're part of this galaxy too.

07:23.583 --> 07:27.500
There are those who view clones
only as military assets.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.541
But I am working to change that,

07:29.625 --> 07:33.416
to ensure you all have the same rights
as any galactic citizen.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.708
It is a battle worth fighting.

07:35.791 --> 07:37.083
[droid beeping]

07:38.083 --> 07:40.541
[beeping]

07:43.208 --> 07:44.208
What was that?

07:45.333 --> 07:46.333
A message.

07:47.750 --> 07:49.458
Can you keep a secret?

07:52.750 --> 07:56.666
[Rampart on PA] <i>The galaxy is at peace,</i>
<i>but our work is never done.</i>

07:57.166 --> 08:00.625
<i>A new military, comprised of</i>
<i>our own citizens, will usher in</i>

08:00.708 --> 08:02.916
-<i>a new era of safety and security.</i>
-An assassin?

08:03.000 --> 08:06.416
It appears Rampart is resourceful
in covering up his misdeeds.

08:07.083 --> 08:09.875
Which is why I intend
to be equally resourceful.

08:10.625 --> 08:14.875
Some associates of mine are
helping procure evidence

08:14.958 --> 08:17.708
of his attack on Kamino
to present to the Senate.

08:17.791 --> 08:20.750
And you're confident
they can accomplish this?

08:21.250 --> 08:22.250
[Omega] Very.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.208
I won't leave such an important task
to chance.

08:26.708 --> 08:29.541
Other senators may have intel
useful to my efforts.

08:29.625 --> 08:32.041
If you're intent on seeing this through,

08:32.125 --> 08:34.500
then there is someone
you should speak with.

08:35.250 --> 08:38.166
But her cooperation
may not be forthcoming.

08:39.791 --> 08:41.000
Halle Burtoni.

08:41.083 --> 08:42.083
Who's that?

08:45.500 --> 08:47.291
Former senator for Kamino.

08:47.375 --> 08:49.458
She was part of
the Defense Finance Committee

08:49.541 --> 08:51.541
before being removed from office.

08:53.583 --> 08:55.208
Follow the money.

08:55.708 --> 08:57.416
It always leaves a trail.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.666
[Rampart] <i>A vote for The Defense</i>
<i>Recruitment Bill is a vote for the future.</i>

09:00.750 --> 09:02.250
<i>Our future.</i>

09:07.625 --> 09:10.208
Senator Burtoni. Thank you for coming.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.541
Are armed guards really necessary?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.625
There is a matter I must discuss with you.

09:28.500 --> 09:31.208
Then speak.

09:33.291 --> 09:35.958
Tell me about the missing
Senate appropriation funds

09:36.041 --> 09:38.375
that were earmarked
for operations on Kamino.

09:39.500 --> 09:43.625
Funding for the cloning facilities has
been siphoned off for over the past year.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.333
You had to have known.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.500
Of course I did.

09:47.583 --> 09:49.208
Where did the money go?

09:49.291 --> 09:50.583
Who diverted the funds?

09:51.708 --> 09:54.250
You're a fool to bring me here.

09:55.041 --> 09:59.791
Do you know what happens
when you dig around where you shouldn't?

09:59.875 --> 10:02.708
-Your people deserve to--
-My people are gone.

10:03.375 --> 10:06.333
[Burtoni] The few remaining Kaminoans
scattered throughout the galaxy

10:06.416 --> 10:09.166
are of no importance to me,

10:09.250 --> 10:13.166
and therefore, not my concern.

10:13.250 --> 10:15.708
How can you not care about
what happened on Kamino?

10:16.666 --> 10:19.666
Why do you care, child?

10:19.750 --> 10:21.750
Because I'm a clone too.

10:21.833 --> 10:23.208
It was my home.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.291
I was there.

10:25.375 --> 10:29.791
I saw the Empire destroy everything,
and I'm angry.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.958
What they did, it's not right.

10:36.958 --> 10:39.541
I suspected an attack was imminent.

10:40.333 --> 10:42.083
Lama Su was arrogant.

10:42.583 --> 10:47.500
Too confident his clones were
a necessity to the Empire.

10:48.625 --> 10:50.208
But none of us are.

10:50.291 --> 10:52.875
Did Admiral Rampart divert the funds?

10:54.541 --> 10:57.208
You already know the answer.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.625
But yes.

10:59.708 --> 11:02.708
You must testify to that
in front of the Senate tomorrow.

11:02.791 --> 11:05.333
He cannot continue to get away
with what he's done.

11:05.416 --> 11:08.500
Rampart is a mere cog in the machine.

11:09.041 --> 11:11.833
And my word won't do you any good.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.250
You need concrete proof.

11:15.333 --> 11:16.916
I need both.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.666
And I'm running out of time.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.458
[beeping]

12:12.291 --> 12:15.208
Haven't been in these maintenance tunnels
since the war.

12:15.291 --> 12:16.625
Gotta say, Rex.

12:16.708 --> 12:19.416
Coruscant's the last place
I'd expect you to be.

12:19.916 --> 12:21.125
It's worth the risk.

12:21.625 --> 12:25.333
More and more of our brothers are
waking up to what's been done to them.

12:25.416 --> 12:27.041
I can't turn my back on them.

12:27.125 --> 12:28.708
How many have you reached?

12:28.791 --> 12:30.000
Not enough.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.291
Troopers who know too much are
a liability to the Empire.

12:33.916 --> 12:38.750
I'm working with a few contacts I trust,
but we're spread pretty thin.

12:40.083 --> 12:42.083
Help's hard to come by these days.

12:43.458 --> 12:44.458
[Wrecker] Got it.

12:48.750 --> 12:49.750
Great.

12:49.833 --> 12:51.583
Ray shields.

12:51.666 --> 12:52.666
[Tech] Leave it to me.

12:52.750 --> 12:55.583
And how are we getting
onto Rampart's <i>Venator</i>?

12:55.666 --> 12:57.541
I'm taking a lesson from your squad.

12:58.208 --> 12:59.500
We improvise.

13:03.833 --> 13:05.000
[beeps]

13:31.958 --> 13:33.666
There's not enough cover.

13:34.875 --> 13:37.416
We won't get across the shipyard
undetected.

-Don't look down.
-This is him better.

14:11.666 --> 14:13.458

Well, that is unfortunate.

Wanna narrow that down?

15:26.583 --> 15:28.416
Energy conduits are off-line.

15:28.500 --> 15:31.375
The only way to retrieve the data is
to reroute power,

15:31.458 --> 15:34.208
which will most likely signal
a security breach.

15:34.291 --> 15:35.916
[Hunter] How much time will we have?

15:37.375 --> 15:38.416

16:06.041 --> 16:08.666
[alarm blaring]

16:14.041 --> 16:15.625
We're gonna have some company.

16:16.208 --> 16:17.583
Wrecker, seal the door!

16:20.708 --> 16:22.125
The controls are out of commission.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.625
[clone trooper] Override them!

16:27.083 --> 16:28.916
[Hunter] The door won't hold much longer.

16:29.000 --> 16:31.791
I am expediting the file transfer
as quickly as possible.

16:38.333 --> 16:39.916
Hostiles confirmed on the bridge.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.500
[alarm blaring continues]

16:58.208 --> 17:01.458
[Hunter] New plan.14, 5, 86.

17:01.541 --> 17:03.125
-All of them?
-[Hunter] Yes.

17:03.208 --> 17:05.708
Echo, man the cannons.
Deal with the air support.

17:18.666 --> 17:20.000
Data transfer is complete.

17:20.083 --> 17:22.125
-[Echo] Plan 5, set!
-[Hunter] Activate.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.125
-Look out!
-Incoming!

17:35.500 --> 17:37.541
[Wrecker screams]

17:42.625 --> 17:44.875
[Rex] Security teams
will be swarming this trench.

17:44.958 --> 17:46.583
-We need an exit strategy.
-Got one.

17:46.666 --> 17:48.375
-We're going over them.
-Over them?

17:48.458 --> 17:50.791
[rumbling]

18:08.583 --> 18:10.375
[Rex]
These escape pods are nonoperational.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.708
[Tech] We only need them to eject.
I can handle the rest.

18:12.791 --> 18:15.291
This should be interesting.

18:34.291 --> 18:35.291
Not bad.

18:35.375 --> 18:36.875
[alarm blaring]

18:36.958 --> 18:40.083
[Tech] I was off by 6.4 meters.
Not my best.

18:40.166 --> 18:41.250
[Wrecker groans]

18:42.833 --> 18:44.833
[Rex] It's almost morning.
We need to hurry.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.750
With the clone trooper provisions
requested by Senator Chuchi

19:08.833 --> 19:10.833
now addressed and the matter resolved,

19:10.916 --> 19:12.791
there is no reason to delay the vote

19:12.875 --> 19:15.416
of the Imperial Defense
Recruitment Bill further.

19:16.583 --> 19:18.250
[Chuchi] That is not the case, Admiral.

19:19.166 --> 19:24.333
We cannot take you on your word
when you have given us reason not to.

19:24.416 --> 19:26.541
And what reason is that?

19:26.625 --> 19:28.583
According to Halle Burtoni,

19:29.250 --> 19:32.625
you were responsible
for diverting Kaminoan funding

19:32.708 --> 19:35.708
to outside projects
without Senate approval.

19:35.791 --> 19:36.916
[all murmuring]

19:37.000 --> 19:40.583
And you believe the lies
of a disgraced Senator?

19:41.125 --> 19:43.666
A formal investigation
should clear things up.

19:44.291 --> 19:47.583
Unless you want to tell us now
where those funds went?

19:47.666 --> 19:50.583
[murmuring continues]

19:54.416 --> 19:55.750
[speeder approaching]

19:58.916 --> 20:00.958
[Rex] Get this to Senator Chuchi. Hurry.

20:05.708 --> 20:09.916
I am not at liberty to disclose the nature
of certain military operations.

20:10.458 --> 20:15.666
The funds you are referring to were
redistributed, not misappropriated.

20:16.291 --> 20:19.958
Your actions began months prior
to the loss of Tipoca City,

20:20.041 --> 20:22.833
almost as if you were preparing for it.

20:22.916 --> 20:24.958
What exactly are you implying?

20:25.041 --> 20:30.375
I assert that the Kaminoan cloning
facilities were intentionally eliminated.

20:30.458 --> 20:32.458
[all clamoring]

20:39.083 --> 20:43.666
I will not dignify such baseless
accusations with more of my time.

20:44.166 --> 20:47.000
Where is this proof you spoke of?

20:47.833 --> 20:49.083
[whispering] I don't know.

20:49.666 --> 20:54.291
If there are no further issues,
let us proceed with this vote.

20:54.375 --> 20:57.750
I motion that Senator Chuchi be removed
from these proceedings,

20:57.833 --> 21:00.583
and she be censured for her misconduct.

21:01.291 --> 21:04.708
-I second the motion.
-[Omega] Senator Organa!

21:06.250 --> 21:07.250
Got it.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.875
[clamoring continues]

21:14.125 --> 21:19.541
Senators, new evidence has come to light
which must be considered.

21:26.500 --> 21:29.458
What so-called proof do you have?

21:29.541 --> 21:32.916
The recovered command log
from Admiral Rampart's <i>Venator</i>.

21:33.541 --> 21:38.041
Which indicates his own ships
caused the destruction of Tipoca City.

21:38.125 --> 21:40.375
[all clamoring]

21:50.500 --> 21:53.583
-[laser cannons firing on recording]
-[alarm blaring on recording]

21:57.625 --> 22:01.291
[all clamoring]

22:01.375 --> 22:06.625
[alarm blaring]

22:29.750 --> 22:33.833
It would appear that Senator Chuchi's
horrific assertions are correct.

22:33.916 --> 22:35.791
[all gasp]

22:35.875 --> 22:41.041
This unprovoked attack on Kamino was
a cowardly act by Admiral Rampart

22:41.125 --> 22:43.625
to further his own personal agenda.

22:43.708 --> 22:44.916
[all clamoring]

22:45.000 --> 22:47.791
Guards, arrest and detain the Admiral.

22:49.666 --> 22:50.833
Stay back!

22:50.916 --> 22:54.291
I was following orders.
I was follow-- [grunts]

22:54.375 --> 22:57.625
-[clamoring continues]
-Order! We shall have order!

22:57.708 --> 22:59.250
[all quieting down]

23:01.541 --> 23:05.666
I am deeply troubled
by this recent revelation.

23:06.791 --> 23:13.541
My gratitude to Senator Chuchi for
exposing a rogue element within our ranks.

23:14.833 --> 23:17.333
Many lives have been lost,

23:18.083 --> 23:19.666
but I assure you,

23:20.291 --> 23:26.291
Admiral Rampart will face
the consequences for his treachery.

23:26.375 --> 23:30.916
-[Rampart grunts]
-However, he did not act alone.

23:31.541 --> 23:36.708
The fact that the clones under his command
so blindly followed orders,

23:36.791 --> 23:40.333
inflicting such carnage
without hesitation,

23:41.083 --> 23:43.000
gives me pause.

23:44.583 --> 23:49.375
Perhaps, it is time for a change.

23:50.083 --> 23:52.166
Now more than ever,

23:52.250 --> 23:58.125
building a strong galaxy requires
protection and security.

23:58.916 --> 24:01.833
Due to the nefarious actions
of Admiral Rampart,

24:01.916 --> 24:05.833
and the immediacy
of the bill on the floor today,

24:05.916 --> 24:12.791
it is my opinion
that this legislation is our future.

24:14.166 --> 24:16.958
With this momentous act,

24:17.458 --> 24:21.625
we shall usher in a new era.

24:21.708 --> 24:26.958
Heralded by the Imperial stormtrooper.

24:40.916 --> 24:44.333
Palpatine was one step ahead of us
during the war,

24:44.416 --> 24:46.958
and he's still several steps ahead of us.

24:47.750 --> 24:49.958
We played right into his hands.

24:50.458 --> 24:51.750
[Omega] I don't understand.

24:52.333 --> 24:55.333
We did the right thing. We told the truth.

24:55.416 --> 24:58.541
And he twisted it to his advantage.

24:58.625 --> 25:03.250
The Emperor wanted us to implicate Rampart
to get what he was after all along.

25:03.916 --> 25:07.083
Senate approval
for his stormtrooper program.

25:07.166 --> 25:11.625
The fate of all the clones is now sealed,
because of us.

25:12.333 --> 25:13.666
What's gonna happen to them?

25:14.166 --> 25:15.291
[Chuchi] I don't know.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.291
But I will keep fighting for the clones.

25:19.375 --> 25:21.958
You all deserve the same rights
as every citizen.

25:25.041 --> 25:26.916
I won't give up.

25:29.041 --> 25:31.708
If you need anything Rex,
just say the word.

25:33.041 --> 25:34.041
Senator.

25:39.416 --> 25:42.916
Wherever you end up, remember what I said.

25:47.791 --> 25:49.916
Don't get into trouble without us.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.750
Without us?

25:52.833 --> 25:54.208
Best of luck, Echo.

25:56.791 --> 25:58.166
Luck with what?

25:59.541 --> 26:00.958
I'm going with Rex.

26:03.166 --> 26:05.916
The clones will need our help
now more than ever.

26:07.250 --> 26:09.125
I can't turn my back on them.

26:09.625 --> 26:11.750
You-- You can't leave.

26:11.833 --> 26:13.916
We're-- We're a squad.

26:14.416 --> 26:17.583
Omega, this is something I have to do.

26:18.208 --> 26:19.916
I'm going where I'm needed.

26:20.000 --> 26:22.708
But we need you too.

26:24.375 --> 26:25.833
It's not forever.

26:25.916 --> 26:26.958
I'll be back.

26:27.541 --> 26:31.750
Keep up with your training while I'm gone.
Huh? Understood?

26:42.875 --> 26:44.041
Yes, Sir.

26:45.833 --> 26:47.833
Keep an eye on them.
