00:01.292 --> 00:03.957
<i>Can't believe you said
you wanted to be a Jedi when you grow up.</i>

00:03.958 --> 00:05.249
<i>So what if I did?</i>

00:05.250 --> 00:07.958
Don't you ever want
to do anything exciting?

00:08.875 --> 00:12.458
I found something buried in the woods.
Wait a minute. Someone's been here.

00:13.167 --> 00:15.332
- You.
- Name's Fern.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.999
She's KB. And this is our find.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.457
If we open it,
then we get to go in and look.

00:20.458 --> 00:21.916
<i>Deal.</i>

00:23.250 --> 00:25.499
-  <i>It's just a droid.</i>
-  <i>A dead droid.</i>

00:25.500 --> 00:27.958
<i>Do not touch that.
Don't touch anything.</i>

00:29.792 --> 00:31.124
Come on. Let's go! Let's go!

00:34.417 --> 00:35.624
It's a starship?

00:35.625 --> 00:37.667
-  Dad! Dad! Up here!
- Wim!

01:21.583 --> 01:23.166
You idiot! What did you do?

01:23.167 --> 01:25.874
We're gonna explode into a million pieces!

01:25.875 --> 01:28.333
- I-- I can turn it off. I can turn it off.
- How?

01:37.667 --> 01:38.667
Whoa!

01:40.583 --> 01:41.583
Where are we?

01:43.042 --> 01:47.166
If that was hyperspace, we could be
really, really, really far away.

01:47.167 --> 01:48.666
This is so bad.

01:48.667 --> 01:51.624
We-- We need to turn around
and go home right now.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.124
Okay, okay. Easy.

01:53.125 --> 01:54.957
If you press another button,

01:54.958 --> 01:56.291
I swear I will--

02:20.125 --> 02:21.125
What is that?

02:26.125 --> 02:29.667
Captain!
Intruders in the cockpit!

02:30.750 --> 02:33.916
What should I do with these gremlins?
Snap their necks?

02:33.917 --> 02:35.417
Throw them out of the airlock?

02:35.917 --> 02:36.999
Don't hurt us!

02:37.000 --> 02:40.250
Captain? Captain?

02:41.583 --> 02:43.291
Gotta do everything around here.

02:43.292 --> 02:45.041
- Come along, you lot.
- Ow!

02:45.042 --> 02:48.041
- Help! Let me go! Help!
-  No! No! Let him go!

02:48.042 --> 02:50.082
-  Let him go.
-  Where are you taking him?

02:50.083 --> 02:52.166
- To see the captain.
-  You gotta do something.

02:52.167 --> 02:54.041
- I think he might be malfunctioning.
-  Neel.

02:54.042 --> 02:56.249
- I can handle a droid. Come on.
-  Captain.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.374
Hey! Your captain's dead.

03:01.292 --> 03:04.749
Impertinent creatures
trying to f-f-fool me.

03:04.750 --> 03:07.457
Then why are we here
and he's not?

03:07.458 --> 03:10.292
According to my program,
there can be no ship without a captain.

03:10.792 --> 03:15.041
And the ship,
she's still here, so... Captain.

03:15.042 --> 03:19.417
Captain. Captain.

03:22.167 --> 03:23.541
Wim, what should we do?

03:23.542 --> 03:27.499
Don't ask him. He's the whole reason
why we're here in the first place.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.374
- Really, it's my fault?
-  Captain.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.499
It definitely is.

03:30.500 --> 03:33.624
- It kind of is.
-  Captain.

03:33.625 --> 03:36.082
I got this. Hey, droid.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.832
What do you want?

03:37.833 --> 03:39.291
What's your name?

03:39.292 --> 03:43.792
There are some who call me SM-33.

03:44.292 --> 03:48.792
Well, SM-33, I have some bad news.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.416
I killed your captain.

03:52.417 --> 03:55.625
Most unlikely.
You seem ill-favored for combat.

03:56.708 --> 03:58.124
But it's true.

03:58.125 --> 04:01.750
I stabbed him right in the guts
and threw him into space.

04:02.375 --> 04:07.791
Which makes me your new captain. Right?

04:14.083 --> 04:16.167
What am I to do with these stowaways?

04:21.792 --> 04:22.792
Captain?

04:24.083 --> 04:26.499
Hey, no fair! I wanted to be the captain.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.374
As crew, you may challenge the captain
to a battle to the death.

04:29.375 --> 04:31.250
Uh, no, that's okay.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.792
Now, SM-33.

04:37.417 --> 04:40.707
- Show me how to fly my ship.
-  It's simple.

04:40.708 --> 04:44.249
Primary acceleration, pitch, yaw, roll,
trim control, secondary acceleration,

04:44.250 --> 04:47.624
rear thrusters, side thrusters,
base thrusters, secondary base thrusters,

04:47.625 --> 04:52.207
tertiary thrusters, rear shield,
front shield, and finally, flaps. Got it?

04:52.208 --> 04:54.082
Yeah. Makes complete sense.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.875
- What does this one do?
-  No, no. No!

04:56.375 --> 04:59.832
That's the emergency
hull demolition sequencer, you fool!

04:59.833 --> 05:03.291
- Never ever, ever touch that.
- I'm not gonna touch it.

05:03.292 --> 05:05.499
- I wish you hadn't said that.
- Can I fly the ship?

05:05.500 --> 05:06.957
-  Wim, no!
-  No!

05:06.958 --> 05:08.457
Aw, man.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.707
Can you fly it?

05:09.708 --> 05:14.082
I most humbly suggest we fix
the critical systems as soon as possible.

05:14.083 --> 05:18.707
I know a safe starport where we can get
anything we need, no questions asked.

05:18.708 --> 05:21.624
No starports. Just turn this thing around
and get us home.

05:21.625 --> 05:22.833
Aye, Captain.

05:28.083 --> 05:32.082
Tell me, where is it that you call home?

05:32.083 --> 05:37.999
Just back where we came from.
It's At Attin. Where we just were.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.458
C-Can't say I remember no At Attin.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.375
How does he not know?

05:42.875 --> 05:45.167
Try searching
your memory bank's last location.

05:47.417 --> 05:51.291
Searching, searching, searching,

05:51.292 --> 05:55.207
searching, searching, searching...

05:55.208 --> 05:56.624
...searching, searching...

05:56.625 --> 05:58.332
I think the rat ate his brain.

05:58.333 --> 06:00.999
...searching, searching...

06:01.000 --> 06:03.042
Hey, little guy.

06:04.292 --> 06:07.041
- He-He jumped at me. I'm all right.
- At Attin! Take us to At Attin!

06:07.042 --> 06:10.457
- Might you be thinking of Atollon?
- No.

06:10.458 --> 06:14.041
Al Alcor? Aldhani?
It's a sulfurous bog world.

06:14.042 --> 06:15.917
- No! At Attin!
-  No! At Attin!

06:16.708 --> 06:20.958
Tell me then, Captain,
which one is At Attin?

06:30.167 --> 06:31.167
We're lost.

06:32.708 --> 06:34.000
We're really lost.

06:34.667 --> 06:36.541
Wim, you promised
we wouldn't get in trouble,

06:36.542 --> 06:39.207
but now we're way,
way out past the Barrier

06:39.208 --> 06:41.625
in so much trouble
that we're lost forever.

06:46.208 --> 06:48.167
Well, it's not all my fault.

06:50.167 --> 06:53.624
Shall I throw him out of the airlock
for insolence, Captain?

06:53.625 --> 06:54.708
Just...

06:55.333 --> 06:57.416
Just bring us
to that starport you mentioned.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.917
Someone there can give us directions home.

07:00.583 --> 07:02.541
Aye, Captain.

07:02.542 --> 07:07.792
Prepare for hyperspace jump
in three, two, one.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.374
What was that?

07:30.375 --> 07:33.000
Primitive lifeform.
Scan is normal.

07:34.083 --> 07:36.708
Have you scanned
anything abnormal?

07:37.917 --> 07:40.208
Negative.
There's nothing in this sector.

07:43.167 --> 07:45.332
Search team four,
reporting in.

07:45.333 --> 07:48.083
Source of seismic disturbance not found.

07:50.125 --> 07:53.332
Wait. Something detected. Moving fast.

07:55.625 --> 07:57.875
Help! Help!

07:58.458 --> 08:00.791
Sir,
this is a restricted area.

08:00.792 --> 08:02.541
What are you doing out here?

08:02.542 --> 08:04.624
A starship. A starship. My son.

08:04.625 --> 08:08.374
- Sir, please remain calm.
- Wim and these other kids.

08:08.375 --> 08:11.250
There's three of them.
They just took off in a starship.

08:11.750 --> 08:12.875
A starship?

08:14.125 --> 08:17.832
Impossible. Starships
are not permitted to enter or leave the--

08:17.833 --> 08:19.707
Could be out past the Barrier by now!

08:19.708 --> 08:22.249
Breaching the Barrier
is a serious violation.

08:22.250 --> 08:24.582
- The Supervisor will not a--
- You gotta find 'em.

08:24.583 --> 08:27.582
It's not safe out there.
You gotta bring 'em back.

08:27.583 --> 08:31.000
- Of course. Come with us, sir.
- You gotta find my son.

08:31.958 --> 08:33.083
Wim!

08:35.042 --> 08:36.208
Wim!

08:37.750 --> 08:41.833
Wim, are you okay? We're in hyperspace.

08:43.833 --> 08:45.083
Wim?

08:58.500 --> 08:59.500
Look!

09:00.625 --> 09:03.000
I think they died in a duel.

09:03.500 --> 09:05.624
I wanna show you
something else! Come on!

09:05.625 --> 09:07.332
I think I found the captain's room.

09:07.333 --> 09:10.000
- Look, we can all sleep in here.
- Ew.

09:10.917 --> 09:12.457
Isn't it wizard?

09:12.458 --> 09:14.292
All these skeletons and things are...

09:15.833 --> 09:20.791
are really neat and everything,
but don't you wanna go home?

09:20.792 --> 09:21.875
Go home?

09:23.125 --> 09:25.875
We just got here. Here, hold this.

09:26.875 --> 09:29.999
What about my mom and dad?
They're probably really worried.

09:30.000 --> 09:33.957
And the twins, Jorko and Jobo,
and little baby Tuloo?

09:33.958 --> 09:37.208
Neel, we're in a starship now.

09:38.250 --> 09:41.875
We can go anywhere we want
in the whole wide galaxy.

09:42.417 --> 09:44.625
But there's a skeleto--

09:46.583 --> 09:51.749
All this stuff
is creepy and gross.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.750
And the ship, it smells bad.

09:54.333 --> 09:58.666
Do you really wanna sleep here?
I just wanna get to the starport.

09:58.667 --> 10:01.875
Wait. We are going to the starport?

10:21.667 --> 10:23.332
Ah, Port Borgo.

10:23.333 --> 10:29.375
They say of Borgo, you'll rest well
in a soft bed or a shallow grave.

10:54.833 --> 10:57.707
This wee ferryman
will take you to the port.

10:57.708 --> 10:59.791
I'll stay aboard and start repairs.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.875
J-Just be sure
to keep your blaster at the ready.

11:03.958 --> 11:05.750
And trust no one, Captain.

11:11.583 --> 11:12.750
Whoa. Oh.

11:24.125 --> 11:27.417
Wow. Look at all those ships.

12:02.125 --> 12:03.583
I think it wants payment.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.374
Pay it, Wim.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.583
Ooh.

12:24.542 --> 12:26.750
Remember,
we need directions home, that's all.

12:27.458 --> 12:30.292
Wim. Wim, what are you doing?

12:30.917 --> 12:32.916
I'm hiding the rest of my dataries.

12:37.083 --> 12:39.167
Oh! Ew.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.750
Okay, all we gotta find
is one normal place to ask for directions.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.208
Look, aliens.

12:47.667 --> 12:49.624
They're so weird-looking.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.791
Can't you plug his trunk or something?

12:51.792 --> 12:53.666
Heh. I don't talk with my trunk.

12:53.667 --> 12:55.082
Just stay together.

13:17.042 --> 13:18.083
What about in there?

13:24.417 --> 13:25.500
Just keep walking.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.042
Go. Better ask somewhere else.

13:36.542 --> 13:39.582
Stay close, guys. This place...

13:39.583 --> 13:42.374
Hold off.

13:42.375 --> 13:45.208
Guys? Guys?

13:47.167 --> 13:48.166
Come on.

14:07.917 --> 14:11.666
Our prices are light years from
exorbitant and satisfaction is ensured!

14:11.667 --> 14:13.707
Buy now! Buy now!

14:13.708 --> 14:18.124
Before your enemy samples
the famous bargains of Borgo.

14:18.125 --> 14:20.749
Death comes to all,
but these bargains are rare.

14:20.750 --> 14:24.583
Watch the droids dance, friends,
dazzle in their lethality!

14:25.458 --> 14:27.750
Are you suffering
from assassination frustration?

14:30.542 --> 14:31.916
Fascinating weaponry.

14:31.917 --> 14:33.541
Absolutely novel toxicants.

14:33.542 --> 14:36.125
Our prices are light years
from exorbitant! Buy now!

14:37.542 --> 14:38.916
One of your enemies...

14:38.917 --> 14:43.333
I said stay together.
Now, where are those stinko boys?

14:44.833 --> 14:47.000
Are you, are you children?

14:49.250 --> 14:51.999
- Who brought you here?
- We brought ourselves. Why?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.749
Honey, Borgo is full
of the nastiest pirates

14:53.750 --> 14:56.124
in the sector.
It's not safe here for children.

14:56.125 --> 14:58.541
-  Pirates?
- Yes. I have to get you to a transport.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.624
- Do you have any money?
- We got our own ship.

15:00.625 --> 15:03.041
We just need some directions home,
and then we'll be out of here.

15:03.042 --> 15:04.375
Okay, well, where's home?

15:07.292 --> 15:08.333
At Attin.

15:08.833 --> 15:11.208
Come on, seriously, girls,
where are you from?

15:14.833 --> 15:19.042
Ooh. That smells good.
Let's go ask for directions over there.

15:22.458 --> 15:23.749
What do you want?

15:23.750 --> 15:29.167
Um... We'll have two of...
whatever he's having.

15:29.958 --> 15:31.582
Nibsy,
give me two more specials.

15:31.583 --> 15:33.249
Hey, hey, hey! Not too much, not too much.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.833
You're always overfillin' it.

15:38.458 --> 15:41.541
Okay, here we go. Daily special.

15:41.542 --> 15:44.583
There, there, nice and tasty.

15:46.375 --> 15:48.124
And one more for you.

15:48.125 --> 15:50.583
Uh, I'm okay.
No topping for me, sir. Um...

15:52.500 --> 15:53.666
That'll be two decs.

15:53.667 --> 15:55.416
That'll be what now, sir?

15:55.417 --> 15:57.374
Two decs. Credits?

15:57.375 --> 15:59.916
What do you think this is,
a kriffing charity?

15:59.917 --> 16:01.875
Uh... Wim, pay him.

16:02.792 --> 16:04.708
Come on, kid, pay up.

16:08.250 --> 16:11.416
Okay. [sighs] Is-- Is this enough, sir?

16:11.417 --> 16:14.333
Whoa!
Where the blazes did you get that?

16:15.042 --> 16:16.042
Oh.

16:16.833 --> 16:18.791
Uh, I mean, uh, this--
this ain't enough.

16:18.792 --> 16:20.624
Premium topping's five decs extra.

16:20.625 --> 16:23.874
And y-you're gonna wanna leave a tip
for, you know, good service.

16:23.875 --> 16:25.832
How much you got on you?
Come on. Let's see.

16:25.833 --> 16:28.207
Watch it. He's trying to cheat ya.

16:28.208 --> 16:29.917
Mind your business, scum!

16:31.917 --> 16:33.208
My arm!

16:33.875 --> 16:37.041
Where'd you two find
an Old Republic credit in mint condition?

16:37.042 --> 16:39.208
- His dad gave it to him for lunch money.
- No. Shh.

16:39.708 --> 16:40.792
Lunch money?

16:42.167 --> 16:43.999
Where are you two from?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.542
Uh, At Attin.

16:47.542 --> 16:49.332
At Attin.

16:49.333 --> 16:50.458
Yeah, right.

16:50.958 --> 16:53.582
What? We're just looking
for some directions.

16:53.583 --> 16:55.542
Yeah. You and me both.

16:56.917 --> 16:58.750
Eh, it's gotta be fake.

16:59.292 --> 17:04.042
Looks real enough to me.
Back off or I'll pop yer breathing sac.

17:04.542 --> 17:06.000
See if they got more on 'em.

17:06.583 --> 17:08.625
Um, Wim, do something.

17:09.833 --> 17:11.749
Run!

17:15.333 --> 17:18.249
- I'm trying to help you.
- You're trying to kidnap us.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.499
You're hurting my arm.

17:19.500 --> 17:20.874
Girls, whatever you're running from,

17:20.875 --> 17:22.499
you need a much better story
than At Attin.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.582
- But it's true.
- Really? You're a couple of linderlings

17:25.583 --> 17:28.082
- from the lost planet of eternal treasure?
- Lost planet?

17:28.083 --> 17:29.541
- Eternal treasure?
-  Help!

17:32.542 --> 17:34.875
Help! Help!

17:36.292 --> 17:38.917
Fern! Fern, help!

17:39.708 --> 17:42.250
Help! Help! Oh!

17:44.583 --> 17:47.125
No. No! No!

17:47.875 --> 17:49.125
Everyone back off.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.292
- Wim, what did you do?
- What? Nothing.

17:59.208 --> 18:03.457
Put it down, little one.
We just want the credits.

18:03.458 --> 18:06.582
There ain't enough to go around
and I saw 'em first.

18:06.583 --> 18:08.416
Unless they really are from At Attin.

18:08.417 --> 18:11.917
Don't be stupid. At Attin's a myth.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.750
Do not touch my captain.

18:49.042 --> 18:51.457
Get back to your ship, droid.

18:51.458 --> 18:53.667
Not without me captain.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.582
What, her?

18:55.583 --> 18:57.957
And I'm not leaving without KB.

18:57.958 --> 18:59.042
Fern!

19:00.250 --> 19:02.333
And the boys.

19:13.667 --> 19:16.625
Come on.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.166
Blast 'em.

19:42.542 --> 19:45.000
I humbly suggest we return to the ship.

19:48.333 --> 19:49.999
This way.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.791
No! Now look what you've made me do.
It's ruined.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.500
I mean, it looks perfect to me, sir.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.208
Wim, Wim, pay him.

20:08.750 --> 20:09.957
Why did you bring us here?

20:09.958 --> 20:11.292
To escape to the ship.

20:11.792 --> 20:14.416
No, why did you bring us
to a pirate port full of pirates?

20:14.417 --> 20:16.166
Because we are also pirates.

20:16.167 --> 20:18.291
We are not pirates.

20:18.292 --> 20:19.582
You're not pirates?

20:19.583 --> 20:21.749
-  We're kids.
-  Why cannot kids--

20:24.083 --> 20:27.999
No. No. 33!

20:35.500 --> 20:39.667
What's a litter of runts
doing in my starport?

20:42.875 --> 20:44.375
We just wanna go home.

20:44.875 --> 20:48.624
How do they have our coordinates?
How did they get past the cannons?

20:48.625 --> 20:50.708
Why didn't you ask our droid
before you shot it?

20:51.708 --> 20:54.166
Don't worry, Captain.
We'll get the truth out of 'em.

20:54.167 --> 20:56.625
See that they don't run off again.

20:58.208 --> 20:59.416
We're right here.

20:59.417 --> 21:02.207
You got a question for us,
ask us yourself.

21:02.208 --> 21:04.249
Don't make him mad, Fern!

21:04.250 --> 21:09.791
Feisty girl. Cool off in the brig
a day or two. Then we'll talk.

21:09.792 --> 21:12.333
Brig? What's a brig?

21:16.250 --> 21:19.499
This is not what the galaxy
was supposed to be like.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.417
You probably shouldn't lay on there.

21:22.000 --> 21:24.166
I mean, the dirt is really dirty.

21:24.167 --> 21:25.999
Okay, enough moping.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.707
Let's figure out
how to get home step by step.

21:28.708 --> 21:33.917
Step one. Get out of the brig.

21:35.125 --> 21:36.125
Okay.

21:36.625 --> 21:38.457
How are we gonna do that?

21:38.458 --> 21:41.999
Hey, what if we train this little guy
to go get the key over there?

21:42.000 --> 21:44.916
- Uh, we can try.
- Move, move. Let's do it.

21:44.917 --> 21:50.999
Climb up those poles and get the key
and come back. You understand me, right?

21:51.000 --> 21:53.499
You got it?

21:53.500 --> 21:57.125
All right. Do it.
It's hanging above there, okay?

22:10.000 --> 22:11.832
- No, no, no, no, no!
- No, no, the other way.

22:11.833 --> 22:13.792
- The key! Over there!
- This way!

22:15.833 --> 22:18.041
-  The key. Over there.
- It's hanging right there.

22:18.042 --> 22:19.500
No, no, no.

22:21.125 --> 22:24.000
No. No.

22:26.125 --> 22:31.666
Anyway. Step two. Find SM-33, fix him,
and get him back to the ship.

22:31.667 --> 22:33.958
- All of that is step two?
- Step three.

22:35.583 --> 22:37.666
We still need directions home,

22:37.667 --> 22:41.166
but everyone thinks At Attin
is some sort of make-believe myth.

22:41.167 --> 22:43.999
That's why those pirates
were laughing at us.

22:44.000 --> 22:47.958
I guess the legend is that At Attin
holds some sort of eternal treasure.

22:49.083 --> 22:51.958
What? That's so dumb.
Who would believe that?

22:53.083 --> 22:55.832
You were the one who hyperspaced us
to the other side of the galaxy

22:55.833 --> 22:59.083
because you thought
we were in a Jedi temple.

23:00.542 --> 23:03.124
Look, maybe we can
just buy our way out--

23:03.125 --> 23:06.082
Don't be so dense. Show 'em that,
and they're just gonna steal it.

23:06.083 --> 23:08.082
At least it's a plan.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.166
We wouldn't be in jail

23:09.167 --> 23:11.417
if you didn't order 33
to fly us to a pirate--

23:11.542 --> 23:13.208
Now, now.

23:14.708 --> 23:16.624
Don't fight.

23:21.292 --> 23:24.292
Fear not. I only want to help you.

23:25.708 --> 23:26.792
Hey, back off!

23:29.083 --> 23:32.208
I can help you get to your ship.

23:34.333 --> 23:35.833
Find that planet of yours.

23:37.917 --> 23:41.250
All I ask is that you take me with you.

23:42.875 --> 23:46.417
I've been stuck
on this scabby rock far too long.

23:48.042 --> 23:49.667
How are we even gonna get out of here?

23:50.958 --> 23:52.083
The key.

23:55.792 --> 23:57.792
Okay, genius, we can't reach it.

24:01.208 --> 24:05.792
The distance between us and the key...

24:10.875 --> 24:12.208
is an illusion.

24:38.167 --> 24:39.167
You're...

24:41.375 --> 24:42.583
You're a Jedi.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.542
Can you keep a secret?
