00:56.691 --> 00:58.559
For aught that
I could ever read,

00:58.660 --> 01:01.529
could ever hear
by tale or history,

01:01.629 --> 01:04.798
the course of true love
never did run smooth.

01:06.034 --> 01:08.836
But either it was different
in blood or else misgraffed

01:08.936 --> 01:10.004
in respect of years,

01:10.104 --> 01:12.173
or else it stood upon
the choice of friends,

01:12.273 --> 01:16.444
or if there were a
sympathy in choice,

01:16.544 --> 01:20.214
war, death, or sickness
did lay siege to it,

01:20.314 --> 01:22.383
making it momentany
as a sound,

01:22.483 --> 01:25.486
swift as a shadow,
short as any dream,

01:25.587 --> 01:28.122
brief as the lightning
in the collied night,

01:28.223 --> 01:30.291
that, in a spleen, unfolds
both heaven and Earth.

01:30.391 --> 01:33.627
And, ere a man has
power to say, "Behold!"

01:39.600 --> 01:42.135
The jaws of darkness
do devour it up.

01:45.373 --> 01:50.378
So quick bright things
come to confusion.

02:16.270 --> 02:17.572
Yo,
we got you, we got you.

02:17.672 --> 02:19.407
Mike Mike, you killed
it tonight, man.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.942
Don't I
do it every time though?

02:21.042 --> 02:22.243
Yeah,
that's true.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.145
But you could have definitely
used that same energy

02:24.245 --> 02:25.346
for opening night
that you had tonight.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.581
I'm gonna
let that one go.

02:26.681 --> 02:28.983
Yeah,
I know, I know.

02:32.753 --> 02:33.987
You good?

02:34.088 --> 02:35.255
Yeah.

02:36.157 --> 02:37.191
Okay, I'm gonna take off.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.492
All right.

02:43.397 --> 02:46.300
You gonna bust
outta here? All right.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.980
B block, step forward.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.918
Hey, fuck you, CO.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.853
Who the fuck said that?

03:42.890 --> 03:45.159
Who the fuck said that?

03:45.259 --> 03:46.894
What the fuck you doin', man?

03:46.994 --> 03:48.595
No fucking cigarettes.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.774
Um, excuse me.

05:09.076 --> 05:09.810
You know, I've been,

05:09.911 --> 05:11.645
trying to catch you
in the yard, man.

05:11.746 --> 05:13.714
It's been kind of hard,
you know?

05:13.814 --> 05:16.584
And basically I
wanted to know,

05:16.684 --> 05:19.419
would you mind signing,
you know this book, man?

05:20.654 --> 05:23.523
Oh, man.

05:24.525 --> 05:25.660
You from, wait,
you from Rikers?

05:25.760 --> 05:28.395
Yeah. Yeah, man. I did two
years on the Island, man.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.730
Very popular there.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.031
Yeah, yeah.

05:31.132 --> 05:32.566
It did really
good there, man.

05:34.268 --> 05:35.536
- Got a pen?
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

05:35.636 --> 05:36.970
Yeah, well, you got it
right there?

05:37.071 --> 05:38.705
Ever ready, yeah, man.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.709
I really appreciate this, man.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.811
That's me. G.

05:44.912 --> 05:45.713
Yeah.

05:45.813 --> 05:47.715
Put a little star
right there for you.

05:47.815 --> 05:49.116
D-DAN: Yeah, man.
Ooh wee!

05:50.651 --> 05:52.820
I'm still flying high,
you feel me?

05:52.920 --> 05:54.388
Still flying high.

05:54.489 --> 05:57.291
That monologue had
everybody paying attention.

05:57.391 --> 05:59.426
- What monologue, mine?
- Divine G, Divine G.

05:59.527 --> 06:00.561
Coldest shit he's done, right?

06:00.661 --> 06:02.396
No, I was all right,
I was all right.

06:02.497 --> 06:04.531
But we still got more work
to do I think, all right?

06:04.632 --> 06:05.900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.434
What do you mean "No,
no, no, no, no, no, no"?

06:07.535 --> 06:08.636
Let's bask in it for a minute.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.871
Those transitions were
rough though, hold on.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.773
<i>Parate con</i> easy.

06:13.774 --> 06:15.409
Let's just enjoy it
for a minute.

06:15.510 --> 06:16.444
- I still just remember...
- Remember the moment.

06:16.544 --> 06:17.544
...the feeling being
on the stage.

06:17.645 --> 06:19.713
D-DAN: It does feel good.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.148
You always gotta be
onto the next.

06:21.248 --> 06:22.517
All right. Okay, I hear you.

06:22.617 --> 06:23.751
All right, so why don't we
just go over the wait list?

06:23.851 --> 06:25.319
- All right. See who could-
- We can do that,

06:25.419 --> 06:26.387
- we could do that.
- Right?

06:26.487 --> 06:27.521
See who can move up.
All right?

06:27.622 --> 06:28.723
- Easy, man.
- All right, cool. Here we go.

06:28.823 --> 06:30.357
- Just gotta make things better.
- Who we got?

06:30.457 --> 06:33.460
We got, uh, Curtis Cross.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.262
- Curtis Cross.
- Who's that?

06:35.362 --> 06:37.030
D-DAN: I don't think so. What?

06:37.131 --> 06:38.932
I'm with you.

06:39.033 --> 06:40.567
Short answer, hell no.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.702
What's the long answer?

06:41.802 --> 06:44.405
The long answer is
he one of them dudes,

06:44.505 --> 06:46.507
he always primping
and propping, you know,

06:46.607 --> 06:48.910
he's gonna step in here,
sit right there,

06:49.010 --> 06:50.111
try and take over every time
we put him in anything.

06:50.211 --> 06:51.245
Put him in a hot seat
from the beginning.

06:51.345 --> 06:52.413
D-DAN: He only wants to-

06:52.513 --> 06:53.681
Yeah, but he don't
think it's a hot seat.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.616
D-DAN: He only wants to sit
next to the females.

06:55.716 --> 06:58.318
He makes women
feel uncomfortable.

06:58.419 --> 06:59.420
Got you. All right. Okay.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.588
How about, all right,
how about this?

07:00.688 --> 07:03.056
We have, uh, now this
is his second time.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.191
Who?

07:04.291 --> 07:05.559
Is, uh, Divine Eye.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.528
- D-DAN: Divine Eye.
- Mm-mm.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.863
Eye...? From Mount Vernon?

07:08.963 --> 07:10.097
D-DAN: I don't think
he's ready.

07:10.198 --> 07:12.266
The brother's smart.
You gotta admit it though.

07:12.366 --> 07:14.268
He teaches history class
at the NAACP.

07:14.368 --> 07:15.402
I'm sure there's a lot of

07:15.503 --> 07:16.503
smart drug dealers
in the yard.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.006
Maybe he, what he
may need from us

07:19.106 --> 07:19.840
is to be able to put that

07:19.940 --> 07:20.941
- energy into this program.
- Divine G.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.509
Divine G, you gonna
vouch for him?

07:22.610 --> 07:24.278
I'll vouch for the interview.

07:24.378 --> 07:25.512
Just for the interview?

07:25.612 --> 07:26.848
Yeah, for the interview.

07:26.948 --> 07:28.049
- And the rest is on him.
- Him getting in, it's up to us.

07:28.149 --> 07:29.417
You know what?
Yeah, we'll give it to you.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.417
Always trying to
save somebody.

07:31.986 --> 07:34.988
Mike Mike, you go check him out
with me. See what's up.

07:35.089 --> 07:37.024
- You and me?
- Yeah.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.692
Let's check him out.

07:46.267 --> 07:48.368
What's up? Make sure done get
that paper to me, right?

07:48.468 --> 07:49.570
Oh, shit yo.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.872
I gotta go do
something real quick.

07:51.972 --> 07:52.939
Damn.

07:56.276 --> 07:57.544
The fuck's he gotta do?

08:00.114 --> 08:01.348
What's up, birdie?

08:01.448 --> 08:02.683
Hey, man.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.118
That little jump shot you did...

08:04.218 --> 08:06.019
-Yeah? You saw that?
- It was nice, yeah.

08:06.119 --> 08:07.655
You got my shit?

08:07.755 --> 08:08.823
- Oh yeah. Um, yeah.
- Yeah, the shit I gave you.

08:08.923 --> 08:09.790
The shit
I gave you, you got it?

08:09.890 --> 08:10.858
- I got it.
- Yeah. Get it.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.292
Just a young dude.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.394
Here we go.

08:13.494 --> 08:14.929
Always a
young white boy.

08:15.029 --> 08:16.896
You really
wanna watch this?

08:20.501 --> 08:23.169
Word, well what
is this though?

08:25.639 --> 08:26.774
What?

08:26.874 --> 08:29.310
What? What you mean what?
What the fuck is this?

08:29.410 --> 08:31.545
This ain't fucking what
I gave you. Do you know...

08:31.645 --> 08:32.813
- This is...
- That, that has not come...

08:32.913 --> 08:34.081
- This is fucking aspirin.
- ...out of my pocket.

08:34.181 --> 08:35.582
This is not what the...
You know what I gave you?

08:35.683 --> 08:38.285
- No.
- Not fucking aspirin.

08:38.385 --> 08:39.886
Worth $500.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.689
This is $500,

08:41.789 --> 08:42.957
- did you know that, brother?
- No, no, no.

08:43.057 --> 08:44.191
I'm gonna be needing it.
I don't give a fuck

08:44.291 --> 08:45.393
what was in your pocket.

08:45.493 --> 08:47.394
I don't care where you had
it or who you know, or none...

08:47.494 --> 08:49.096
I don't know

08:49.196 --> 08:50.531

08:50.631 --> 08:51.765

08:51.866 --> 08:53.000
I'm gonna be needing
all of that.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.869
- You heard what I said?
-Look, I, I, I...

08:54.969 --> 08:57.805
I don't care what the fuck
you's talking about right now.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.440
This what's going on, $500.

09:00.541 --> 09:01.675
Don't care how you get it.

09:01.776 --> 09:03.678
Don't give a fuck what you
got to do to get it.

09:03.778 --> 09:04.812
Get my fucking bread to me,
you heard what I said?

09:04.912 --> 09:06.247
I can't get you $500.

09:06.347 --> 09:07.815
- You're going to get me $500.
-I can't get you $500.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.683
You're gonna do whatever
the fuck you got to do.

09:09.784 --> 09:11.719
I don't give a fuck
what you got to do.

09:11.819 --> 09:14.655
You're gonna do that shit
to get my fucking bread.

09:14.755 --> 09:15.956
You heard what I said?

09:16.057 --> 09:18.926
Or I'm gonna tear your
fucking face off in here.

09:19.026 --> 09:23.096
Now here, take this bullshit
and get the fuck out my face.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.164
Go get my money.

09:30.504 --> 09:31.738
Peace, King. Peace.
What's happening?

09:31.839 --> 09:33.006
Peace, brother. Hey.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.609
That was really fucked up.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.477
Yeah well, shit happens,
man, you know.

09:37.578 --> 09:38.712
Dude gonna get schooled by

09:38.812 --> 09:40.481
somebody somewhere,
so, you know,

09:40.581 --> 09:42.349
I'm just charging
for the lessons, homie.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.551
Expensive lesson.

09:43.651 --> 09:46.486
Listen, you signed
up for the RTA program.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.554
Yeah. Yeah.

09:47.654 --> 09:49.223
And we have a few spots open.

09:49.323 --> 09:51.391
Yeah, just like one
or two and that's it.

09:51.492 --> 09:52.593
And we wanted to know

09:52.693 --> 09:54.228
if you wanted to put
those acting skills

09:54.328 --> 09:56.530
that we just saw down there
to some good use?

09:56.630 --> 09:57.598
- What, that?
- Yeah.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.466
Y'all thought that was acting?

09:59.566 --> 10:01.335
Yeah, man.

10:01.435 --> 10:03.002
You ain't seen nothing yet.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.605
All right.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.174
So why'd you sign up
for the program?

10:07.274 --> 10:09.309
Yeah, you know, you got
some pretty volunteers

10:09.409 --> 10:11.345
I saw up on that stage.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.746
Chicks, y'all got up in here.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.781
Yeah, man.
It's not really like that.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.349
They're our colleagues.

10:18.719 --> 10:21.121
Do I need a reason?
Do I really need a reason?

10:22.523 --> 10:24.657
-Yeah.
- Well, we just...

10:25.726 --> 10:27.260
I'm just asking you
to be honest.

10:28.529 --> 10:30.230
- Honest, huh?
- Yeah.

10:31.231 --> 10:32.232
All right.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.336
Well, one day I came
across a book, man,

10:36.436 --> 10:38.739
on keeplock in my cell,

10:38.839 --> 10:40.007
so I ain't got
shit else to do.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.175
So I got this book,
cracked it open

10:42.276 --> 10:43.510
and some of the things

10:43.611 --> 10:44.745
the brother was
saying in the book,

10:44.845 --> 10:46.113
really resonated with me, man.

10:46.213 --> 10:48.482
I mean, the brother said...
what'd the brother say?

10:48.582 --> 10:52.253
He said, "When we are born,

10:52.353 --> 10:57.358
"we cry because we're
born to a stage of fools."

10:59.626 --> 11:01.028
And I said, yo,

11:01.128 --> 11:05.732
whoever wrote this, man, had to
did a bid before, you know?

11:12.472 --> 11:13.340
- Yeah.
- So...

11:13.440 --> 11:16.110
<i>King Lear</i> just
fell off of a library cart

11:16.210 --> 11:18.812
and you just happened to pick
it up and read a few pages.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.848
Yeah. Shit funny, right?

11:23.417 --> 11:25.118
- Yeah.
- Huh.

11:27.587 --> 11:28.688
We'll be in touch.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.390
All right.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.491
Stay up.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.262
Okay, he knows verse.

11:36.363 --> 11:37.197
Yeah.

11:37.298 --> 11:40.066
Two and a half hours?

11:45.272 --> 11:47.108
He called me an old
man just a second ago.

11:50.644 --> 11:51.979
- How much you want?
- What you got?

11:52.079 --> 11:54.247
Yeah
man, I'm just holding uh...

11:54.347 --> 11:55.949
Hello, everybody!

12:02.956 --> 12:05.358
Good to see
some familiar faces.

12:06.326 --> 12:07.995
For those of you
who don't know me,

12:08.095 --> 12:11.699
my name is Brent and
I'll be at your service

12:11.799 --> 12:13.967
as your director for
whatever you decide to do

12:14.067 --> 12:16.003
for your upcoming production.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.305
But there'll be plenty of
time for all that later.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.574
Right now, let's just
warm ourselves up.

12:20.674 --> 12:23.277
We're gonna warm up the space.
Warm up your instruments.

12:23.377 --> 12:25.545
I want everybody
to start walking around

12:25.646 --> 12:27.280
like you just won the lottery.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.815
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

12:28.915 --> 12:31.351
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah!

12:33.287 --> 12:36.823
How about a zombie,
what does a zombie walk like?

12:36.924 --> 12:38.225
There! I like... Oh, that's...

12:38.325 --> 12:39.426
Basehead,
that's all that is.

12:39.526 --> 12:42.530
Some of your
best work, my friends!

12:42.630 --> 12:43.964
<i>♪ Doh doh, doh doh doh doh ♪</i>

12:44.064 --> 12:45.566
How about
if you're walking

12:45.666 --> 12:47.467
- on some hot coals?
- Hot coals.

12:47.568 --> 12:49.203
- Hot coals.
-Hot coals.

12:49.303 --> 12:53.440
Gentlemen, congratulations
on <i>Midsummer.</i>

12:58.879 --> 13:00.981
I mean, I gotta say
Shakespeare,

13:01.081 --> 13:02.849
you guys did beautiful work.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.985
You should all be proud.
Really.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.187
-Not easy.
- Oh, yeah.

13:07.287 --> 13:10.957
So have you decided
what's next?

13:12.426 --> 13:13.460
We know what it won't be.

13:13.560 --> 13:14.994
No more Shakespeare.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.564
What? I like Shakespeare.

13:17.664 --> 13:18.598
We can do <i>West Side Story.</i>

13:18.699 --> 13:19.800
Not back to back.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.701
<i>Sacrifice?</i>
<i>Wizard of Oz?</i>

13:21.802 --> 13:23.103
August Wilson's good...

13:23.203 --> 13:25.038
Why don't we do
one of Divine G's plays?

13:25.138 --> 13:26.506
- Yes.
- Time we take it back

13:26.606 --> 13:27.474
to one of our own.

13:27.574 --> 13:28.909
-Please.
- Why don't we talk about it?

13:29.009 --> 13:30.277
Nah.
I love that idea.

13:30.377 --> 13:32.345
No, no, no.
I don't know about that.

13:32.446 --> 13:34.114
I don't know about that.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.517
Well, wait.
I... Oh, pressure's on.

13:36.617 --> 13:39.319
Okay, well, how about, I
don't know if it's ready, but,

13:39.420 --> 13:41.221
all right, I just,
I just finished one.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.322
-Okay.
- Now that he just

13:42.422 --> 13:44.057
put my business
in the streets.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.893
It's called <i>Fine Print.</i>

13:45.993 --> 13:49.830
It's a saga of Zabar Turner,
he's a record producer.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.698
It's all about him
getting tricked

13:51.798 --> 13:54.835
into giving up
his record studio

13:54.935 --> 13:57.304
by a conniving Fast Freddy.

13:57.404 --> 14:02.208
It's a story of the dangers
of overzealous ambition.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.277
Mmm.

14:03.377 --> 14:08.382
And how all relationships
under heaven contain...

14:09.883 --> 14:10.817
<i>Fine Print.</i>

14:10.918 --> 14:12.319
-There we go!
- I like it.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.988
<i>Fine Print!</i>

14:15.089 --> 14:18.157
You know what?
That sounds amazing.

14:19.259 --> 14:22.095
So, have you guys decided?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.130
Are we gonna take a vote here

14:23.230 --> 14:25.298
or anybody else
have any ideas?

14:26.032 --> 14:28.234
Oh, hold on, new man.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.369
Yes, sir.

14:29.469 --> 14:31.104
Yeah.

14:31.205 --> 14:32.973
I don't mean to
step on anybody's toes

14:33.073 --> 14:34.407
in here or nothing.

14:34.508 --> 14:36.443
Or disrespect the group,

14:36.543 --> 14:40.147
but do all the plays
have to be so serious?

14:40.247 --> 14:43.150
Yo, what do you mean
by serious though?

14:43.250 --> 14:45.819
I mean like every day we
dealing with trauma, drama.

14:45.919 --> 14:48.021
Every day we got tragedy.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.890
I mean, I think population

14:49.990 --> 14:51.624
just might appreciate
a comedy.

14:54.495 --> 14:55.795
How do you guys
feel about that?

14:55.896 --> 14:57.163
Makes sense.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.199
You got a comedy?

14:59.299 --> 15:01.634
I ain't got a comedy,
I don't write comedies.

15:01.735 --> 15:02.669
I got satires.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.137
We never did it before.

15:04.238 --> 15:06.173
What kind of
comedy would you propose?

15:06.273 --> 15:07.641
I mean, would it
be a broad comedy

15:07.741 --> 15:09.143
or something more
low key or...

15:09.243 --> 15:11.144
I don't know, I'm just talking
about making people laugh.

15:11.245 --> 15:12.779
Yeah, I understand,
but I'm just trying to

15:12.879 --> 15:13.914
be more specific
in terms of like

15:14.014 --> 15:15.015
what kind of comedy you want.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.050
I mean,
that's just my opinion.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.485
How about
a cowboy comedy?

15:18.585 --> 15:19.386
There we go.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.021
I always wanted
to do a western,

15:21.121 --> 15:22.555
like <i>Blazing Saddles</i>
or something.

15:22.656 --> 15:23.757
Egyptians!

15:23.857 --> 15:25.526
Egyptian comedies?

15:25.626 --> 15:27.594
We could sneak some
Shakespeare in there.

15:27.694 --> 15:28.728
<i>Hamlet.</i>

15:28.829 --> 15:30.831
<i>Hamlet</i> in the comedy?

15:30.931 --> 15:33.067
<i>Hamlet</i> in the comedy.
All right.

15:33.167 --> 15:35.101
We could do something
in the forest,
<i>Robin Hood</i>

15:35.202 --> 15:36.169
or something like that?

15:36.269 --> 15:38.772
<i>- Peter Pan.</i> Yeah.
- Yeah.

15:38.872 --> 15:40.607
How about <i>Jason?</i>

15:40.707 --> 15:42.108
<i>Nightmare on Elm Street.</i>

15:42.209 --> 15:44.043
Could I ask a question?

15:44.878 --> 15:46.480
Can someone name a comedy

15:46.580 --> 15:49.282
that contains all that
bullshit that you just named?

15:50.016 --> 15:51.651
We could do time travel.

15:51.751 --> 15:53.653
Well now that is true.

15:54.721 --> 15:55.789
I mean, with time travel,

15:55.889 --> 15:57.157
we could put all
the things in there

15:57.257 --> 16:00.294
that you guys are mentioning
and have a ton of roles.

16:00.394 --> 16:03.096
Get more people up on stage
and maybe even

16:03.197 --> 16:05.731
have a message in there
or not, I don't know.

16:06.867 --> 16:09.336
What do you think
about that, G?

16:09.436 --> 16:12.138
If you're not into it, I could
take a stab at writing it.

16:12.739 --> 16:13.507
I think that's cool.

16:13.607 --> 16:15.409
You take a...
You do it, you got it.

16:15.509 --> 16:17.444
It's what everybody
else wants, right?

16:17.544 --> 16:19.746
That's not really in my
wheelhouse, so you got it.

16:19.846 --> 16:21.148
I'll tell you what,

16:21.248 --> 16:24.985
I'll run it by Katherine
and if the script sucks,

16:25.085 --> 16:26.653
we can always pivot to
something else, right?

16:26.753 --> 16:28.922
All right.

16:29.022 --> 16:30.757
Mike Mike, go ahead.

16:30.857 --> 16:33.392
So Maestro,
we take it to a vote?

16:34.060 --> 16:35.061
Yep.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.129
Let's do it.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.731
Let's go for it.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.966
- Everybody?
- Raise your hand, Mike Mike.
Let's go.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.534
Hey, man.

16:41.635 --> 16:43.002
All right, done.

16:52.246 --> 16:55.882
G, I've read
five drafts, at least,

16:55.982 --> 16:57.851
of <i>Fine Print</i> front to back.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.785
It is really solid, man.

17:01.221 --> 17:02.456
And it could be funny.

17:02.556 --> 17:07.560
I mean, you know, if you
do the right take on it.

17:07.661 --> 17:09.096
It's a straight drama.

17:09.196 --> 17:11.631
No point in trying to
change that, I mean, come on.

17:11.731 --> 17:12.599
All right.

17:12.699 --> 17:16.103
But maybe you got another
play that's funnier

17:16.203 --> 17:17.971
and then we could run
it up for another vote?

17:18.071 --> 17:20.540
Mike Mike, you know,
look, it's really okay.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.475
I'm really good with it,
all right?

17:22.575 --> 17:23.510
Okay.

17:23.610 --> 17:26.312
Not gonna be pushy with you, man.

17:27.981 --> 17:30.083
Maybe that knucklehead
is right.

17:32.585 --> 17:33.487
Ah, man.

17:33.587 --> 17:35.655
I mean, it'll take
the edge off around here.

17:36.323 --> 17:37.624
It will be a lot easier

17:37.724 --> 17:40.760
than all that dying
we normally do.

17:40.861 --> 17:43.963
"Dying is easy. Comedy is hard."

17:45.165 --> 17:46.700
A character actor said that.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.202
I heard that from...
Brent told me that.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.837
This shit gonna kill me.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.907
All right, men.

17:54.007 --> 17:55.875
Took everything you wanted,

17:55.976 --> 17:58.178
and put it right in here.

17:58.278 --> 18:03.283
It's got ancient Egypt,
pirates, Old West gunfights.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.221
I even sprinkled a little
bit of the Black Plague

18:07.321 --> 18:09.523
and Roman Gladiators in there
because at the time

18:09.623 --> 18:11.024
it just seemed like
it was a good idea.

18:11.124 --> 18:12.225
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh-huh.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.893
All right.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.161
Whoa.

18:16.529 --> 18:17.830
147 pages?

18:17.931 --> 18:19.366
In one weekend?

18:19.466 --> 18:21.535
Well, I had a lot
to fit in there,

18:21.635 --> 18:23.669
but it's got
a couple of dance numbers,

18:24.704 --> 18:26.639
a couple of songs,

18:26.740 --> 18:28.375
a <i>Hamlet</i> soliloquy.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.444
But at the heart of the story,

18:31.545 --> 18:33.447
it's all about an
Egyptian prince

18:33.547 --> 18:37.817
who follows clues through
time to find his mummy.

18:38.385 --> 18:39.419
Freddy in this?

18:39.519 --> 18:41.187
Oh, Freddy is
definitely in this.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.422
It'll make sense when you guys

18:42.522 --> 18:43.757
start to read it, okay?

18:43.857 --> 18:44.858
But while you're reading it,

18:44.958 --> 18:48.261
I want you to pick out a
role that you identify with.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.830
Now, the cast list
is on the board.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.365
Pick a time slot.

18:52.466 --> 18:54.367
There's enough in here
for everybody

18:54.467 --> 18:56.202
to have at least one role.

19:08.181 --> 19:09.682
Good afternoon.

19:09.783 --> 19:11.885
My name is Dario Pena,

19:11.985 --> 19:16.356
and I will be auditioning
for the role of Whiskerandos.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.058
My name is Carmine.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.727
I'm auditioning
for the part of Coal.

19:20.827 --> 19:24.698
My name is Patrick Griffin,
they call me Preme.

19:24.798 --> 19:29.803
I'm gonna read the role
of the ring announcer.

19:30.404 --> 19:33.773
I'm D-Dan, reading
for the part...

19:35.074 --> 19:36.976
Alotincommon.

19:37.077 --> 19:39.578
"Now indeed, I am a prisoner.

19:40.646 --> 19:41.782
"Yes.

19:41.882 --> 19:46.886
"Now I feel the galling weight
of these disgraceful chains,

19:46.986 --> 19:50.423
"which cruel Tilburina,

19:50.524 --> 19:54.795
"thy doting captive
gloried in before."

19:54.895 --> 19:58.665
"I'm tired of bashing guys'
brains out with mallets

19:58.765 --> 20:03.136
"and ripping their hearts
out with my bare hands.

20:03.236 --> 20:05.505
"I gotta get outta here."

20:05.606 --> 20:08.642
My name is David James
Giraudy, also known as Dap.

20:08.742 --> 20:11.911
And I'll be reading
for Leslie.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.317
"Mummy, mummy, is that you?"

20:17.417 --> 20:20.253
D-DAN: "Yes, son,
that is your mummy."

20:20.353 --> 20:22.922
"Oh, mummy, mummy,
I miss you so."

20:23.022 --> 20:24.591
"Draw your gun, Marshall.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.193
"Point it at me
and pull the trigger.

20:27.293 --> 20:28.528
"In the time it takes

20:28.629 --> 20:31.364
"for your little bullet to
travel from there to here,

20:31.464 --> 20:32.699
"I'll have ducked, rolled,

20:32.799 --> 20:34.768
"and filled you
with so many holes

20:34.868 --> 20:37.036
"that you'll whistle like
a steam kettle

20:37.137 --> 20:38.672
"when the wind blows."

20:38.772 --> 20:41.273
"Coal, prepare to meet
your maker."

20:44.911 --> 20:45.978
There's no other lines.

20:49.249 --> 20:50.784
You pull a carrot
and I pull a broccoli.

20:50.884 --> 20:53.119
D-DAN: No, that's fine,
that's pretty good there.

20:53.220 --> 20:54.888
- There's no lines.
- D-DAN: No, no, no.

20:54.988 --> 20:57.657
You're absolutely right.
Everything's good.

20:57.757 --> 21:02.095
"We like maiming,
flagellation,

21:02.195 --> 21:03.997
"skewering and flailing.

21:04.097 --> 21:08.801
"Nothing pleases us more
than to see an exposed liver

21:08.902 --> 21:10.403
"or a popped eyeball."

21:10.504 --> 21:14.074
"I'll duck, roll, and
fill you so full of holes,

21:14.174 --> 21:18.310
"that you'll whistle
like a steam kettle
when the wind blows."

21:19.312 --> 21:20.980
Hello, my name is
James Williams,

21:21.080 --> 21:22.682
also known as Big E.

21:22.783 --> 21:27.520
And I'm reading for the part
of the ring announcer.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.123
And I'm six foot five.

21:30.223 --> 21:31.358
I want you to
imagine yourself

21:31.458 --> 21:34.861
in a coliseum, and I want
you to be a gladiator

21:34.961 --> 21:36.329
fighting to the death,

21:36.429 --> 21:38.764
not only for survival,
but for performance.

21:39.732 --> 21:40.834
Survival?

21:40.934 --> 21:44.103
And the performance,
as gladiators do.

22:07.761 --> 22:11.564
I got this signature move,
you gotta wait for it.

22:18.538 --> 22:19.872
What other roles
have you played

22:19.973 --> 22:21.708
in other productions?

22:21.808 --> 22:24.478
To be honest with y'all,
I lost count.

22:24.578 --> 22:28.214
I could sit here and tell you
Chief Bromden, Stratford.

22:28.314 --> 22:31.384
I was in <i>Macbeth</i>
as King Duncan.

22:31.484 --> 22:32.752
I was in
<i>The Silence of the Heart,</i>

22:32.853 --> 22:36.155
I was a police officer.
And I was the boss

22:36.255 --> 22:38.191
in <i>Of Mice and Men.</i>

22:38.291 --> 22:40.293
Once I played an angel.

22:40.393 --> 22:42.162
Except that wasn't
here in RTA,

22:42.262 --> 22:44.764
that was when I was
three years old.

22:44.865 --> 22:47.466
I've been playing
a role my whole life, bro.

22:48.568 --> 22:52.138
"To be or not to be.

22:52.238 --> 22:53.506
"That is the question.

22:54.407 --> 22:55.575
"Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind

22:55.675 --> 22:57.210
"to suffer
the slings and arrows

22:57.310 --> 22:58.812
"of outrageous fortune,

22:58.912 --> 23:02.281
"or to take arms against
the sea of troubles

23:02.382 --> 23:03.582
"and by opposing,

23:04.817 --> 23:05.818
"end them.

23:08.955 --> 23:09.922
"To die,

23:10.890 --> 23:11.891
"to sleep,

23:13.292 --> 23:14.995
"no more.

23:15.095 --> 23:17.797
"And by asleep to say
we end the heartache

23:17.898 --> 23:21.901
"and the thousand natural
shocks that flesh is heir to

23:23.002 --> 23:24.971
"'tis a consummation

23:25.071 --> 23:26.805

23:32.011 --> 23:33.012

"Perchance to dream.

23:37.383 --> 23:38.551
"Ay...

23:40.653 --> 23:41.820
"there's the rub."

23:45.925 --> 23:46.693
Thank you.

23:46.793 --> 23:48.361
D-DAN: Divine,
can you step out please?

23:48.461 --> 23:49.929
- Sure.
- D-DAN: Divine G.

23:50.029 --> 23:50.930
Thank you.

23:51.031 --> 23:53.098
D-DAN: We got someone
else reading for Hamlet.

23:55.669 --> 23:57.470
I'm sorry, somebody else
is going out for Hamlet?

23:57.570 --> 23:59.038
Divine Eye.

24:01.307 --> 24:03.809
Okay. All right, thanks.

24:09.882 --> 24:10.850
You're up.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.552
You sounded
great in there. Intense.

24:12.652 --> 24:13.686
Thank you, I appreciate it.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.021
Hey, yo.
Can I ask you something?

24:15.121 --> 24:16.456
-Anything.
- You wanted to do a comedy,

24:16.556 --> 24:17.623
- right?
-Sure did.

24:17.724 --> 24:18.691
Now we're doing a comedy.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.026
And I'm excited.

24:20.127 --> 24:21.327
And yet you're auditioning
for the only dramatic role

24:21.427 --> 24:22.795
in the whole play.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.597
Comedy's very difficult, man.

24:24.697 --> 24:26.165
I don't wanna get up
on that stage

24:26.266 --> 24:28.133
and get ya'd off
the stage, bro.

24:29.402 --> 24:30.636
Hey, there my boys,
right here.

24:43.149 --> 24:44.717
How about some <i>Hamlet?</i>

24:44.818 --> 24:47.019
Whoa, Laurence Olivier.
Here we go.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.299
I'd also like to note,
commissioners,

25:00.400 --> 25:01.501
that I was a candidate

25:01.601 --> 25:02.902
to become a New York City
police officer.

25:03.002 --> 25:05.338
Yes, yes,
we see that in your packet.

25:05.438 --> 25:07.340
We also see some other things.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.709
Was this before you
decided to become

25:09.809 --> 25:11.911
a rampaging drug dealer?

25:12.011 --> 25:14.547
Well, sir, I only hustled that

25:14.647 --> 25:16.449
one year after my accident.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.051
And, my God...

25:18.151 --> 25:20.353
Mike Mike, can you please
stop messing around

25:20.453 --> 25:21.421
with that paddle, I can't...

25:21.521 --> 25:22.689
- I'm listening.
- But I can't focus

25:22.789 --> 25:23.790
when you're not giving
the whole vibe.

25:23.890 --> 25:25.592
You know what, my bad.
I got you.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.460
I'll do the commissioner
voice this time, everything.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.494
- Man.
- All right?

25:28.594 --> 25:30.129
All right. Come on, come on.

25:31.464 --> 25:32.765
Listen up, Whitfield.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.400
The commission is not here

25:34.501 --> 25:36.903
to talk about what
you could have been.

25:37.003 --> 25:39.706
We're here to talk about
who you really are.

25:39.806 --> 25:43.076
It says here that you were
in some sort of enterprise

25:43.176 --> 25:47.013
called Mix Machine, some sort
of criminal organization?

25:47.113 --> 25:49.348
No, sir, it is not a
criminal organization.

25:49.448 --> 25:51.083
I was a DJ.

25:51.184 --> 25:52.452
- A DJ?
- Yeah, yeah.

25:52.552 --> 25:55.621
Well, I bet you was
funky as hell!

25:55.721 --> 25:57.757
Weren't you? Admit it.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.492
Admit it! You was funky.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.394
You was funky.

26:01.494 --> 26:02.895
Did you, did you pop lock?

26:02.996 --> 26:04.263
- Did you pop lock?
- Ga ga!

26:04.363 --> 26:06.599
- Zz-zz-zz.
- Kah, kah.

26:06.700 --> 26:10.336
All right gentlemen,
I need your attention

26:10.436 --> 26:11.537
and your bodies.

26:11.637 --> 26:12.838
- Form a circle.
- RTA!

26:12.938 --> 26:13.906
Let's go.

26:15.842 --> 26:18.478
Thank you, men. Thank you.

26:18.578 --> 26:19.612
C'mon D-Dan.
D-Dan!

26:19.712 --> 26:21.481
This one's asleep.
What's up?

26:21.581 --> 26:23.549
Let's get to work,
let's get busy.

26:23.650 --> 26:25.418
We're gonna do
a character exercise.

26:25.518 --> 26:26.619
I'm gonna pick somebody out.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.554
They're gonna come to
the center of the circle,

26:28.655 --> 26:31.390
introduce yourself
as your character,

26:31.491 --> 26:32.692
in that character's voice

26:32.792 --> 26:34.560
and then hand it off
to the next actor.

26:34.661 --> 26:37.730
You sir, are number one, first.

26:37.831 --> 26:41.567
Alotincommon,
the Egyptian high priest.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.001
Get it. Get it.

26:44.504 --> 26:47.139
I guess
I'm fucking Gravedigger.

26:51.911 --> 26:53.913
What's the matter,
Gravedigger?

26:54.013 --> 26:56.549
Freddy's claws got
you tongue tied?

26:56.649 --> 26:59.752
Freddy! Oh, I am... no.

26:59.852 --> 27:03.289
I am Leslie,
the Egyptian prince.

27:03.390 --> 27:06.792
Okay, can I start a cuss?
Because I am Startacuss!

27:06.893 --> 27:09.462
No, I am Start... man.

27:09.562 --> 27:11.163
I'm the gunslinger Coal.

27:11.264 --> 27:12.632
The rootin' tootin',

27:12.732 --> 27:15.601
carrot totin', shootin',
you know.

27:15.701 --> 27:18.270
I am Gladiator Goliathan.

27:18.371 --> 27:20.106
And I'm Zakariedies.

27:20.206 --> 27:21.507
If you want to play
in the coliseum,

27:21.607 --> 27:22.575
you gotta see me.

27:22.675 --> 27:25.611
And I am Captain Hook.

27:25.711 --> 27:29.315
Arr, arr.

27:29.415 --> 27:30.983
Hit it.

27:31.084 --> 27:33.586
I'm Prince Hamlet of Denmark.

27:33.686 --> 27:35.455
Oh!

27:35.555 --> 27:37.290
Hold on, back off now,
come on now.

27:37.390 --> 27:38.724
We just saw Divine Eye.

27:38.825 --> 27:41.360
We wanna see Prince Hamlet.

27:41.460 --> 27:42.461
Bring it, come on.

27:43.696 --> 27:45.798
I am Prince Hamlet of Denmark.

27:45.899 --> 27:47.533
- D-DAN: There we go.
-All right.

27:50.503 --> 27:52.605
It's gonna get better,
it's gonna get better.

27:56.142 --> 27:56.876
Yes, sir.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.945
I got a question
about my character.

27:59.045 --> 28:01.147
I mean,
wouldn't he be freaked out

28:01.247 --> 28:03.182
by some dude
from ancient Egypt

28:03.283 --> 28:05.384
time traveling
all the way into like

28:05.484 --> 28:06.953
the middle of the ocean?

28:07.053 --> 28:09.956
And do we even have
a common language?

28:10.056 --> 28:13.292
- Language?
- Well, good questions.

28:13.993 --> 28:16.029
Remember, it's a comedy.

28:16.129 --> 28:19.498
So we can take some liberties
and have some fun with it.

28:19.599 --> 28:20.666
You can make it up.

28:20.767 --> 28:22.135
Yeah, we're gonna
have some fun with it.

28:22.235 --> 28:24.971
I'll tell you what, we can
workshop it when we get to it,

28:25.071 --> 28:26.239
- when we get to it...
- I have a question.

28:26.339 --> 28:27.673
-Yes, sir.
- Can't let this go. I'm sorry.

28:27.774 --> 28:30.009
We gotta talk about
this time travel.

28:30.109 --> 28:31.844
Is it gonna be a wormhole?

28:31.945 --> 28:35.315
I mean, we're gonna
breach the fabric of time?

28:35.415 --> 28:38.017
Like what kind of effect is it
gonna have on a human body?

28:38.117 --> 28:39.685
- Gentlemen, again...
- Brent, hold up.

28:39.786 --> 28:42.788
All good questions,
but you know...

28:43.322 --> 28:44.257
Go ahead.

28:44.357 --> 28:46.592
Hey, all right you guys.
All right, just listen.

28:46.693 --> 28:48.694
Okay, listen, you guys,

28:48.795 --> 28:50.697
you wanna do a
cowboy play, all right.

28:50.797 --> 28:52.965
Somebody right here
wanna do ancient Egypt

28:53.066 --> 28:56.035
and somebody, for
God knows reason,

28:56.135 --> 28:59.038
threw in Freddy Krueger,
all right. He did.

28:59.138 --> 29:00.239
- So how...
-I just got the role,

29:00.340 --> 29:01.407
- I didn't ask for it...
- Okay, well anyway,

29:01.507 --> 29:02.775
it doesn't matter. But how was

29:02.875 --> 29:04.710
Brent supposed to get
all of that in here?

29:04.811 --> 29:06.412
He did it, right? He delivered.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.881
I think we should just
focus on the scenes.

29:08.981 --> 29:11.617
Look at the emotion of it,
the arcs,

29:11.718 --> 29:13.285
and the work
will take care of itself.

29:13.386 --> 29:14.854
- Fair.
- Well said.

29:14.954 --> 29:16.322
Trust the process.

29:16.422 --> 29:17.556
You are correct, sir.

29:17.657 --> 29:18.824
- Thank you, G.
- Sure.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.128
Okay, that's just great.

29:22.228 --> 29:26.465
So, why don't we
start with your scene.

29:26.565 --> 29:27.767
- Gotcha.
- MIKE MIKE Ooh.

29:27.867 --> 29:31.437
I'm really tired of
this miserable profession.

29:31.538 --> 29:34.640
I don't want to be all
mean and tough no more.

29:34.740 --> 29:38.377
I'd like to be
gentle and kind.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.578
Really?

29:39.678 --> 29:40.646
Me too.

29:40.746 --> 29:44.217
Look, I'm trying to escape,

29:44.317 --> 29:48.821
but my boss has threatened to
kill me, my wife, and kids.

29:48.921 --> 29:50.089
My boss too.

29:50.189 --> 29:52.858
Why, I've been trying
to organize the guys

29:52.958 --> 29:54.393
for like forever!

29:57.429 --> 29:59.765
Let's break out.

29:59.865 --> 30:01.066
Let's.

30:02.101 --> 30:03.736
Amazing.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.304
Amazing!

30:05.405 --> 30:07.006
You see that shit?
You see that shit?

30:07.106 --> 30:08.574
I made some choices,
I made some choices.

30:08.674 --> 30:09.842
Come on.

30:09.942 --> 30:11.077
There you go.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.845
I made some choices.
Ooh!

30:12.945 --> 30:13.980
All right.
So, who's next?

30:14.080 --> 30:15.981
- Yeah, I got that.
- You got it. Come on.

30:18.251 --> 30:20.386
We're doing Shakespeare.

30:20.486 --> 30:21.887
-Get it.
- Yeah, come on. We got you.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.638
Fuck this shit, man.

30:40.940 --> 30:42.908
- Did I miss something? What?
- That's it?

30:43.009 --> 30:44.010
That's all right, men.

30:44.110 --> 30:46.178
We're just gonna
trust the process here.

30:46.278 --> 30:47.213
That's all right. We're here

30:47.313 --> 30:48.781
to support each other.
Who's next?

30:48.881 --> 30:50.516
Who's next? Come on.

30:50.616 --> 30:51.517
Come on, Dap. Let's go.

30:51.617 --> 30:52.952
It's hard to follow him,
but all right.

30:53.052 --> 30:54.252
That's all right.

31:07.867 --> 31:09.669
What's up, what's up? Peace.

31:09.769 --> 31:11.970
Son, get that money, son,
you heard?

31:20.112 --> 31:22.247
All right, men. Let's take five!

31:23.349 --> 31:24.850
Yo, yo, yo, Eye.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.351
Let me holler at you
for a minute.

31:27.720 --> 31:28.754
All right.

31:28.855 --> 31:30.456
Yo, want you to
check some shit out.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.792
Five means five.

31:32.892 --> 31:35.560
It does not mean 15,
like Mike Mike.

31:37.230 --> 31:39.232
Man, this is my spot.

31:39.332 --> 31:41.666
Look at that, you can see
everything out there.

31:43.102 --> 31:46.072
Yo, Eye, I just wanted to say

31:46.172 --> 31:48.307
I recognize that you're
a little frustrated

31:48.407 --> 31:49.708
with the way
things are going...

31:49.809 --> 31:51.143
I'm not frustrated with shit.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.446
Them exercises
is goofy as fuck.

31:53.546 --> 31:55.214
Yeah, they are goofy as fuck.

31:55.315 --> 31:57.883
But there's an intention to
them, you know what I mean?

31:57.983 --> 31:59.785
I feel like it helps you get

31:59.885 --> 32:01.087
some depth. Helps you find a...

32:01.187 --> 32:02.622
Is this the speech you
give all the new guys?

32:02.722 --> 32:03.956
I'm not trying
to give you a speech.

32:04.056 --> 32:05.057
Listen, I already
know what you're doing,

32:05.157 --> 32:06.659
know who you are,
what you about, bro.

32:06.759 --> 32:07.927
- What?
- You wanna run around here

32:08.027 --> 32:09.829
herding everybody up
with the little lessons,

32:09.929 --> 32:12.031
and you call all the shots
and all that.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.399
That's all good and all that.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.234
But I'm not here for that.
I ain't come here for that.

32:15.334 --> 32:16.668
I know you got a
knife in your waistband.

32:16.769 --> 32:17.969
Of course.

32:19.671 --> 32:20.673
Brother.

32:20.773 --> 32:22.675
This fucking program is all
these motherfuckers got.

32:22.775 --> 32:24.944
Makes them feel like they can
get the fuck up outta here.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.980
If not literally out there,
out there in here.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.049
Don't take that away
from them, all right?

32:30.149 --> 32:31.851
And a knife in your waistband
will be the first thing

32:31.951 --> 32:33.219
to make sure this
shit fucking crumbles.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.755
You don't get to fucking
tell me what I need in prison.

32:35.855 --> 32:38.924
You don't get to do that,
nobody do.

32:39.024 --> 32:40.760
Nobody take care of me.

32:40.860 --> 32:42.862
Nobody do nothing
for me or mines.

32:42.962 --> 32:44.731
So don't tell me what to do

32:44.831 --> 32:47.600
and don't bring me in no
fucking dark corners no more.

32:47.700 --> 32:50.068
This shit make
a nigga nervous, you heard?

32:52.838 --> 32:54.139
We don't use nigga in here.

32:55.574 --> 32:56.541
We use beloved.

32:57.843 --> 32:59.111
You feel me on that?

33:24.403 --> 33:26.505
Where's Blaze?
Anybody seen Blaze?

33:26.606 --> 33:28.340
Blaze?
Blaze in five building.

33:28.441 --> 33:30.543
They been keeplocked all day.

33:30.643 --> 33:32.077
What about Divine Eye,
is he in five building?

33:32.178 --> 33:34.346
Nah,
Divine Eye is in A block

33:34.447 --> 33:35.381
but I don't know
where he's at.

33:35.481 --> 33:37.249
You could send Dap
to get him though.

33:56.002 --> 33:59.137
Only place to catch
a breeze, man.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.211
How's your girl doing?
The little one?

34:08.213 --> 34:10.248
Growing up, I guess.

34:11.817 --> 34:12.784
Yeah.

34:14.153 --> 34:16.722
When's the last time
you talked to her?

34:16.822 --> 34:18.190
Oh...

34:21.493 --> 34:23.595
I don't count those days, G.

35:21.687 --> 35:22.687
Gentlemen,

35:24.223 --> 35:28.560
I'd like you to go to
your most perfect spot.

35:30.395 --> 35:31.730
Perfect moment.

35:36.636 --> 35:40.505
Do you hear anything?
Are there any sounds?

35:44.043 --> 35:45.410
Are you with somebody?

35:56.155 --> 35:58.323
What is the temperature?

36:01.093 --> 36:02.294
Are you inside?

36:08.400 --> 36:09.567
Are you outside?

36:10.703 --> 36:14.906
Now, just hold
that feeling tone.

36:15.007 --> 36:16.241
Hold it.

36:16.341 --> 36:17.909
Remember it.

36:18.010 --> 36:19.244
Savor it.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.252
All right men, you can
open your eyes.

36:37.296 --> 36:40.965
Does anyone wanna describe
where they just were?

36:44.603 --> 36:45.570
Blaze?

36:47.373 --> 36:51.677
So, I'm sitting in seven
building yard on a bench

36:51.777 --> 36:53.611
that overlooks
the Hudson River.

36:54.647 --> 36:57.416
And on the other side
of that yard

36:57.517 --> 37:02.521
or the other side of that
water, actually, is my mother.

37:03.489 --> 37:07.560
And I know that sometimes
she goes down that mountain

37:07.660 --> 37:11.463
and looks over the water
to where I am at Sing Sing.

37:13.165 --> 37:16.901
And for me, just looking
out at the water,

37:18.737 --> 37:20.439
I gain my peace

37:20.539 --> 37:22.807
because I see the waves
and they're peaceful

37:24.476 --> 37:26.644
and it gives me something
to focus on.

37:28.347 --> 37:30.549
June of 1972,

37:30.650 --> 37:35.454
my wife and I had a picnic
by the lake in Prospect Park.

37:35.554 --> 37:39.324
That's the first time I ever
told my wife I love her.

37:40.025 --> 37:41.527
If anybody here knows,

37:41.627 --> 37:42.761
we bought Manhattan Specials.

37:42.862 --> 37:44.630
You know what
a Manhattan Special is?

37:44.730 --> 37:48.167
It's coffee soda, comes in
glass bottles about this big.

37:48.267 --> 37:51.336
We bought four of them,
I love that stuff.

37:51.437 --> 37:53.304
And we went to Prospect Park.

37:54.073 --> 37:55.607
And, uh, we went by the lake.

37:57.242 --> 38:01.079
And six months ago
I lost that.

38:02.214 --> 38:05.350
She passed away from
pancreatic cancer.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.787
Boy am I gonna miss her.

38:10.889 --> 38:12.991
Summer, 1977.

38:13.992 --> 38:15.294
It's hot.

38:15.394 --> 38:17.863
Water ice truck coming
down the street.

38:17.963 --> 38:21.000
Mom gives me 25 cents

38:21.100 --> 38:23.601
and I go running down
the street to get it.

38:24.336 --> 38:26.838
It taste all cool in your mouth.

38:28.240 --> 38:29.475
What flavor?

38:29.575 --> 38:32.544
Cherry, I love cherry.
Mouth all red.

38:33.913 --> 38:35.914
Spending time with
my son and my daughter.

38:37.116 --> 38:40.652
Just watching 'em grow,
living their life, you know?

38:42.955 --> 38:43.722
90 degree weather,

38:43.822 --> 38:46.425
cutting grass in the backyard

38:46.525 --> 38:48.360
to a point where
I'm just so exhausted

38:48.461 --> 38:51.730
and I just lay back
and I smell the fresh grass

38:51.830 --> 38:53.832
I just cut and I'm dozing off

38:53.933 --> 38:56.301
and my dog come
licking sweat off my face.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.605
Every summer, my mother
sent me to Baltimore

38:59.705 --> 39:02.708
with my uncles and they only
a few years older than me.

39:02.808 --> 39:04.777
And it was a sense of freedom

39:04.877 --> 39:07.379
'cause my mother wasn't
looking over my shoulder.

39:08.914 --> 39:11.750
I tried to do one about
the islands, you know?

39:11.851 --> 39:13.652
My grandma would always tell
us about the islands.

39:13.752 --> 39:16.154
The islands, that's where
our people are from.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.491
Couldn't do it, Maestro.

39:20.359 --> 39:21.827
I ain't never been there.

39:21.927 --> 39:24.996
Ain't never been there,
and I'm not gonna get there.

39:27.866 --> 39:31.636
This is real.
I'm stuck in this space.

39:34.606 --> 39:36.875
But if I'm gonna be
stuck in a space

39:36.975 --> 39:39.477
I guess I'll do it
with you suckers.

39:40.745 --> 39:41.914
Payasos.

39:42.014 --> 39:44.983
In here it's all right,
get a little release.

39:46.485 --> 39:48.152
So I guess this is my space.

39:50.255 --> 39:52.457
I think you guys
are becoming actors.

39:55.027 --> 39:57.862
Just being real with
each other and vulnerable.

39:59.198 --> 40:03.101
It's something men don't
really get to do too often.

40:21.019 --> 40:23.221
To be, or not to be

40:24.189 --> 40:26.091
that is the question.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.394
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer

40:28.494 --> 40:31.296
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune

40:31.396 --> 40:33.432
or to take arms...

40:33.532 --> 40:35.434
- Bro, what's up?
-What's up?

40:35.534 --> 40:36.602
Why you walking
behind me, bro?

40:36.702 --> 40:38.070
I'm supposed to be
walking behind you.

40:38.170 --> 40:39.672
- Bro, all this room right here?
- Why don't you just do what

40:39.772 --> 40:40.739
- the hell you're supposed to?
- All this room right here

40:40.839 --> 40:42.074
- and you gotta...
- That's his blocking.

40:42.174 --> 40:43.509
Bro, I'm saying this the shit
niggas wanna do in the yard

40:43.609 --> 40:44.710
Focus on what
you're supposed to.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.278
That's what I'm supposed to do, man.

40:46.378 --> 40:48.013
Bro listen, don't be doing shit

40:48.113 --> 40:49.482
- you wouldn't be doing
in the yard.
- Or what?

40:49.582 --> 40:50.749
- Put your fucking
hands down man.
- The fuck you talking about,

40:50.849 --> 40:51.783
-"put my hands down"?
- You heard

40:51.884 --> 40:52.850
- what the fuck I said man.
- Enough!

40:55.187 --> 40:56.888
Yo, Eye.

40:58.824 --> 41:01.259
I used to be a keeplock
monster, man,

41:02.094 --> 41:04.829
consumed in my own anger.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.770
'Til one morning in breakfast,

41:11.870 --> 41:14.707
the guy sitting
across from me,

41:14.807 --> 41:17.575
someone stepped behind him
and he cut him ear to ear.

41:21.079 --> 41:22.381
And we all sat there

41:22.481 --> 41:24.549
as the blood flew
across our clothes

41:24.649 --> 41:26.318
and our faces,

41:26.418 --> 41:28.586
and we pretended
that was normal.

41:34.126 --> 41:38.797
Brother, we're here to
become human again.

41:38.897 --> 41:42.167
To put on nice clothes
and dance around.

41:42.268 --> 41:45.937
And enjoy the things that
is not in our reality.

41:53.512 --> 41:55.680
All right,
you remember your mark?

41:56.748 --> 41:57.716
Yeah,
I'm supposed to be standing

41:57.816 --> 41:58.884
next to the Gravedigger

41:58.984 --> 42:01.753
then Marion and Leslie
come outta nowhere.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.122
Materialize from nowhere.

42:03.222 --> 42:04.990
All right, somebody's gonna
walk behind you eventually,

42:05.090 --> 42:06.959
act like it don't bother you,
that's all.

42:07.059 --> 42:09.427
Now let's go, you know
your first line, let's go.

42:09.528 --> 42:10.895
Let's run it again.

42:10.996 --> 42:11.897
Come on man.

42:15.400 --> 42:16.567
Fuck it.

43:05.851 --> 43:06.985
Use the whole thing.
There you go.

43:07.085 --> 43:09.120
Sweep through.

43:11.223 --> 43:12.223
Yeah, same thing.

43:16.361 --> 43:17.529
I'm focused.

43:30.509 --> 43:31.776
You were doing great...

43:37.616 --> 43:39.083
Why aren't you up there?

43:42.788 --> 43:45.123
They're not rehearsing
any scenes I'm in today.

43:46.758 --> 43:48.526
So you just drifted on in, yeah?

43:48.627 --> 43:50.094
Yeah, I sure did.

43:50.195 --> 43:51.162
Okay.

43:52.631 --> 43:54.031
What's those notes?

43:54.799 --> 43:56.067
What notes?

43:57.402 --> 43:58.203
Those notes.

43:58.303 --> 44:00.972
These... just some things
I'm working on

44:01.072 --> 44:02.374
to help some brothers out.

44:02.474 --> 44:04.009
Get healthier food
around here.

44:04.109 --> 44:06.144
And then some
litigation business.

44:06.244 --> 44:07.211
Hmm.

44:08.213 --> 44:09.180
That's dope.

44:13.151 --> 44:14.119
You got any kids?

44:14.219 --> 44:15.787
Wait, so you just gonna be
all in my business today?

44:15.887 --> 44:17.955
Is that what today is?
All right.

44:19.258 --> 44:22.293
Yeah, I got kids.
Two girls and a boy.

44:25.563 --> 44:26.798
What's their names?

44:29.000 --> 44:32.003
Divequa, Dinasia and Karron.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.642
Karron is the boy, he was born
right when I got in here.

44:37.742 --> 44:38.910
So, uh, you know.

44:41.113 --> 44:42.614
He actually wants
to be an actor,

44:42.714 --> 44:45.449
like this bunch of nuts.

44:46.618 --> 44:48.886
He's doing YouTube videos
and stuff.

44:50.855 --> 44:52.256
What about your girls?

44:58.864 --> 45:00.998
They, uh, they have
their own lives.

45:02.500 --> 45:03.467
Yeah?

45:06.571 --> 45:08.073
When I started this bid,

45:08.173 --> 45:10.275
my son was real young, man.

45:10.376 --> 45:13.745
You know, the homies in the
hood, they took care of him.

45:13.845 --> 45:15.079
'Cause that's my son.

45:16.248 --> 45:17.682
Rolled out the
red carpet for him.

45:17.783 --> 45:20.384
Anything he wanted,
treated him well.

45:22.387 --> 45:23.422
Then it wasn't long

45:23.522 --> 45:26.391
before he started doing the
same things I was doing.

45:26.492 --> 45:29.293
Putting in the same kind
of pain I was putting in.

45:30.362 --> 45:33.398
And now he's in prison,
just like me.

45:33.498 --> 45:35.933
Wearing greens, just like me.

45:42.341 --> 45:44.877
Line?
You're looking through

45:44.977 --> 45:46.445
the wrong end of the eyeglass.

45:46.545 --> 45:49.113
Seems like
I'm not the only one, huh?

45:53.084 --> 45:54.051
Nah.

45:55.220 --> 45:59.591
He doesn't know that there's
tricks to learning lines.

45:59.691 --> 46:00.725
Tricks?

46:00.825 --> 46:02.026
Yeah.

46:02.594 --> 46:03.794
What?

46:04.762 --> 46:05.930
Yeah.

46:06.598 --> 46:07.798
What's the tricks?

46:09.267 --> 46:10.235
Everybody has
a different process.

46:10.335 --> 46:11.570
Some people like me,
I write out

46:11.670 --> 46:13.638
every single one of my lines.
You know what I mean?

46:13.739 --> 46:15.007
That's the way I know
how to digest it.

46:15.107 --> 46:16.741
Some people, and it might be
helpful for you

46:16.842 --> 46:18.743
to just underline
every action,

46:18.843 --> 46:20.045
every active word, right?

46:20.145 --> 46:22.480
Take it little by little
and break it down.

46:22.581 --> 46:23.648
Eventually, you know,
you start

46:23.748 --> 46:24.816
paraphrasing a little bit,

46:24.916 --> 46:26.017
but then it'll all start
to make some sense.

46:26.117 --> 46:27.219
You know what I'm saying?

46:27.319 --> 46:28.787
And then you sort of like
break it down, you know,

46:28.887 --> 46:30.055
like how you would
eat an elephant.

46:30.155 --> 46:31.690
You wouldn't swallow
that thing whole, right?

46:31.790 --> 46:32.824
You would just...

46:32.924 --> 46:34.759
take every little bite,
bite, bite, bite.

46:34.860 --> 46:35.994
And then it all makes
more sense.

46:36.094 --> 46:37.162
I think I learned some of that

46:37.262 --> 46:38.997
in the law library.
You know what I mean?

46:39.097 --> 46:41.433
Some of these cases
are so in depth,

46:41.533 --> 46:42.500
you know, especially like

46:42.601 --> 46:43.368
preparing for my
clemency hearing.

46:43.468 --> 46:45.337
I mean, I gotta like
break it all down.

46:45.437 --> 46:47.138
Yeah, I heard you
found a tape or something

46:47.238 --> 46:48.773
that proves your innocence?

46:48.874 --> 46:51.843
Yeah, man,
it took me 10 years but...

46:51.943 --> 46:53.045
- Mmm-hmm.
- ...I got it.

46:53.145 --> 46:54.913
So you don't need no good luck
or nothing, man.

46:55.013 --> 46:56.847
You already got
the golden goose.

46:58.116 --> 47:00.051
I hope so, I think I do.

47:00.152 --> 47:02.286
- I hope so, man. I hope so.
- Yeah.

47:02.687 --> 47:04.055
Um, what about you?

47:05.690 --> 47:06.991
I don't mean to be
in your business,

47:07.092 --> 47:08.360
but I did look at the docket

47:08.460 --> 47:11.462
and I saw that you have
a parole hearing coming up.

47:11.562 --> 47:12.731
Yeah.

47:12.831 --> 47:14.132
Hey listen,
I gotta hit the yard.

47:14.233 --> 47:16.134
Take care of a little bit
of business, all right?

47:16.234 --> 47:17.936
Peace.

47:18.036 --> 47:21.305
Yeah, if I can be of any,
um, help...

47:22.407 --> 47:23.374
Yep.

47:25.944 --> 47:27.378
All right.

47:37.722 --> 47:38.923
To die,

47:40.258 --> 47:41.258
to sleep,

47:44.929 --> 47:46.130
to sleep,

47:48.066 --> 47:49.834
perchance to dream.

47:49.934 --> 47:52.269
Ay, there's the rub.

47:56.241 --> 47:57.608
Okay, you wanna
take that again?

47:58.710 --> 47:59.978
Why, did I do something wrong?

48:00.078 --> 48:01.412
No, no, no,
we're just working at it.

48:01.513 --> 48:02.647
But, I'll tell you what,

48:02.747 --> 48:04.516
let's try something here.

48:04.616 --> 48:05.684
As long as we're not eating

48:05.784 --> 48:07.886
no fucking elephants
or nothing.

48:07.986 --> 48:09.988
Okay, I don't know what
that means, but I won't.

48:10.088 --> 48:11.623
Let's start from the
very beginning,

48:11.723 --> 48:12.958
- okay?
- To be...

48:13.058 --> 48:14.359
I don't mean the beginning
here on your mark,

48:14.459 --> 48:17.896
I mean in the wings.
That's where it begins.

48:17.996 --> 48:19.698
So I want you
to go back there.

48:19.798 --> 48:22.100
I want to see you come on
the stage with Hamlet's...

48:22.200 --> 48:23.435
You're in Hamlet's world

48:23.535 --> 48:24.903
and you're bringing that
all the way to your mark.

48:25.003 --> 48:26.037
And then you say your line.

48:26.137 --> 48:27.304
Let's try it.

48:30.875 --> 48:32.410
It's the moment before, guys.

48:42.887 --> 48:44.522
- To be...
- Hold up, did you do it?

48:44.622 --> 48:46.390
Because we all fell asleep.

48:46.491 --> 48:48.292
Ooh!

48:49.428 --> 48:51.229
You ain't see me just
walk from over there?

48:51.329 --> 48:52.764
I saw you walk out here

48:52.864 --> 48:54.532
like a man who's
asking this audience

48:54.632 --> 48:56.034
for permission to be here.

48:56.134 --> 48:58.469
I wanna see
Hamlet come out here,

48:58.570 --> 48:59.471
take the stage and say,

48:59.571 --> 49:03.108
"Hey! It's time to start
paying attention to me."

49:03.208 --> 49:04.376
- You have to show...
- Ah, Brent, Brent.

49:04.476 --> 49:06.310
-Yes, G?
- Do you mind if I...?

49:06.811 --> 49:07.912
Please.

49:08.013 --> 49:11.349
Cool. Watch. All right.
Yo, Eye.

49:11.449 --> 49:13.518
The world expects
brothers like you and I,

49:13.619 --> 49:16.454
all these brothers, to walk in
with our heads held down,

49:16.555 --> 49:18.590
you know, apologizing
for being there.

49:18.690 --> 49:20.392
Now, what you gotta walk in

49:20.492 --> 49:22.660
- is like a motherfucking king!
-Ooh!

49:22.761 --> 49:24.595
Like you own all this shit.

49:24.696 --> 49:26.330
Everything is yours.

49:27.565 --> 49:28.700
So you want me
to do it right now?

49:28.800 --> 49:30.000
Right now.
Yeah.

49:31.369 --> 49:33.070
Fucking...

49:34.672 --> 49:36.574
I'm the fucking king, nigga.

49:39.911 --> 49:41.278
Like the yard, but bigger.

49:45.116 --> 49:47.051
I'm Divine fucking Eye!

49:47.152 --> 49:49.053
Yeah.
Yeah.

49:49.154 --> 49:50.655
I own this fucking theater.

49:50.755 --> 49:52.157
This is my fucking theater.

49:52.257 --> 49:54.559
-I own this bitch!
- I own all this shit.

49:54.659 --> 49:55.594
That's it, yeah.

49:55.694 --> 49:56.894
Now give him some love,
give him some love.

49:58.063 --> 49:59.097
All right, all right,
that's enough.

49:59.197 --> 50:00.932
All right, now, what's your
emotional state?

50:01.032 --> 50:02.200
What's underneath that?

50:02.300 --> 50:03.735
Mad as a motherfucker.

50:03.835 --> 50:05.437
Okay.
No, no, no. Okay.

50:05.537 --> 50:08.072
Anger is the easiest thing
to play.

50:08.172 --> 50:09.340
Am I right, Brent?

50:09.440 --> 50:10.442
Too easy.

50:10.542 --> 50:13.912
What's more
complicated is to play hurt.

50:14.012 --> 50:16.914
That helps you name the thing,
all right?

50:17.015 --> 50:19.416
Now try that. All right.

50:20.018 --> 50:20.952
From the top.

50:21.052 --> 50:22.486
There you go, Brent. Ha!

50:27.626 --> 50:30.295
Guys, the superintendent's
got some big money

50:30.395 --> 50:32.664
sitting out in these
seats tonight.

50:32.764 --> 50:34.765
Money that can get us
new stage curtains.

50:34.866 --> 50:36.067
Ooh.

50:36.168 --> 50:39.003
I need you guys to melt
their faces off with this.

50:39.103 --> 50:40.572
- Okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

50:40.672 --> 50:42.206
We gonna
beat 'em down? Oh, no.

50:42.307 --> 50:43.941
I want you to be savage.

50:45.943 --> 50:47.144
So let's go.

50:48.412 --> 50:49.413
Let's go!

50:59.991 --> 51:02.593
Sure. All right. Okay.

51:05.463 --> 51:07.765
Let's go. Come on.
Come on, man.

51:17.576 --> 51:22.180
Take this sacred amulet
with you for your protection.

51:22.280 --> 51:23.982
You will need it one day

51:24.082 --> 51:27.251
before the end
of your journey, young man.

51:28.553 --> 51:30.188
Scooch to the right a little.

51:31.857 --> 51:34.959
I'm on my mark, bro.
Scooch your fucking light.

51:35.059 --> 51:36.060
We can move the mark a little,

51:36.161 --> 51:37.195
we can move
the mark a little bit.

51:37.295 --> 51:39.030
We're gonna move the mark.

51:39.130 --> 51:40.565
Just a skosh.

51:40.665 --> 51:42.233
Dick.

51:58.950 --> 52:00.084
This headband is not Egyptian.

52:00.184 --> 52:01.185
It's clearly Phoenician.

52:01.285 --> 52:02.320
- Really?
- Yes.

52:02.420 --> 52:04.088
I'll talk to props. Thank you.

52:04.188 --> 52:06.024
Cucumbers? Eggplant?

52:06.124 --> 52:07.291
Come on, Brent,
I need six shooters.

52:07.392 --> 52:08.560
E, that's why it's funny.

52:08.660 --> 52:10.261
They're expecting
to see six shooters.

52:10.361 --> 52:12.830
You pull out vegetables,
it's a comedy!

52:25.410 --> 52:29.213
You'll need it before
the journey's end.

52:29.313 --> 52:30.781
Let's be gone, young one.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.324
Oh, take this amulet man.

52:39.424 --> 52:41.825
Wear this shit,
it's gonna protect you.

52:43.528 --> 52:45.263
You gonna need it before
the end of the journey.

52:45.363 --> 52:47.331
Let's get the fuck outta here,
let's go.

52:49.100 --> 52:50.367
Ah.

52:50.968 --> 52:51.936
Ah.

52:54.472 --> 52:56.974
- Oh!
- Motherfucker...

53:13.024 --> 53:14.258
Thank you.

53:19.196 --> 53:20.364
Well, uh,

53:21.799 --> 53:23.234
thanks for coming.

53:23.335 --> 53:26.370
You see the look on the one
with the hair like this?

53:27.505 --> 53:29.774
She was not having us.

53:29.874 --> 53:31.108
I think they cursed us.

53:33.812 --> 53:36.614
We don't really need
those curtains anyway.

53:39.417 --> 53:41.085
We sure worked hard
for it though.

53:47.726 --> 53:50.828
Shut the fuck up.

53:52.497 --> 53:54.798
Can't believe that
you picked that scene.

53:58.369 --> 53:59.703
But they loved it.

53:59.804 --> 54:01.739
Oh!

54:01.839 --> 54:02.906
Shit.

54:09.414 --> 54:11.548
This is good. This might work.

54:15.153 --> 54:16.287
Yo, how about this for you, man?

54:16.387 --> 54:17.554
Here you go.

54:17.955 --> 54:19.090
Bam.

54:22.260 --> 54:23.928
What's up? You all right?

54:24.028 --> 54:25.295
Yeah.

54:26.230 --> 54:27.398
It's just,

54:30.301 --> 54:32.837
my slings and arrows
on the inside

54:32.938 --> 54:37.943
and all this make believe
acting and college degrees...

54:40.045 --> 54:43.314
It don't really change
the fact I'm a gangster

54:43.414 --> 54:46.417
and that's my destiny.

54:46.518 --> 54:49.019
That's what's waiting for me
on the outside, bro.

54:51.188 --> 54:52.356
It's like Hamlet.

54:53.624 --> 54:55.193
All he wants is Maid Marion,

54:55.293 --> 54:58.362
and he'll go against
the whole Greek army.

54:59.196 --> 55:00.764
But to what end?

55:01.232 --> 55:02.433
What?

55:03.100 --> 55:04.035
Oh, shit. I'm sorry.

55:04.135 --> 55:05.770
I keep forgetting
how different

55:05.870 --> 55:08.839
this version of <i>Hamlet</i> is
from the original.

55:11.342 --> 55:12.543
Yo. What I...

55:12.644 --> 55:15.846
what I do know,
if I don't know anything,

55:15.947 --> 55:17.382
is you're an artist.

55:17.482 --> 55:20.518
This is just bringing
out parts of yourself

55:20.618 --> 55:23.421
that has been hidden,
you know, remained dormant.

55:23.521 --> 55:26.291
Just go for it, trust it.

55:26.391 --> 55:28.826
All right? Leave all the
other shit behind.

55:28.926 --> 55:29.994
Go full out.

55:31.162 --> 55:33.998
Try something new,
get into some shit like this.

55:34.099 --> 55:35.767
No, I'm not gonna never
get into no shit like this.

55:35.867 --> 55:37.235
Why the fuck you ain't
gonna get in this?

55:37.335 --> 55:38.570
This is fucking regal,
it's a prince.

55:38.670 --> 55:42.040
How about this? Look.
How about that with the towel?

55:42.140 --> 55:45.109
- Nah, it's not my thing.
- All right, well,
that's all right.

55:45.209 --> 55:46.410
A towel?
Come on, bro.

55:46.511 --> 55:47.545
All right, well, how about...

55:47.645 --> 55:48.546
- Find something for me, man.
- I don't know.

55:48.646 --> 55:49.948
Something I could rock, man.

55:50.048 --> 55:51.582
Yo. How about this?
How about this? Look.

55:51.682 --> 55:52.683
That's kind of funky.

55:52.784 --> 55:54.585
I might could do
something with that.

55:54.685 --> 55:55.653
All right.

55:55.753 --> 55:57.055
- I might could rock that.
- There you go.

55:57.155 --> 55:58.589
All right.
Either this or the towel,
I think.

55:58.689 --> 55:59.991
I think this towel might-

56:00.091 --> 56:01.325
Come on, bro, why you keep
trying to put me in the towel?

56:01.426 --> 56:02.393
I told you this right here, man.

56:14.705 --> 56:16.107
Who next? Who next?

56:16.207 --> 56:18.209
Wait, I thought
you were gonna
do some shit next.

56:18.309 --> 56:20.878
You gotta do that.

56:22.279 --> 56:23.314
- Whoa.
- Oh!

56:23.414 --> 56:24.615
That one, that one!

56:29.020 --> 56:31.356
<i>♪ Ba da cha da da ♪</i>

56:31.456 --> 56:32.423
<i>- ♪ Cha ♪</i>
- Hey, lock it up, lock it up.

56:32.523 --> 56:33.758
Lock it up.

56:33.858 --> 56:35.426
Lock it! Lock it!
Lock it! Lock it!

56:35.526 --> 56:36.894
Lock it! Ah!

56:36.994 --> 56:39.397
Yeah!

56:39.497 --> 56:41.465
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

56:48.539 --> 56:51.208
Go, go, go, go.

56:52.476 --> 56:55.145
Blaze, what about you?

56:57.414 --> 56:58.349
There you go.

56:58.449 --> 56:59.650
Whoa!

57:01.485 --> 57:02.920
- Uh-oh!
- Uh-oh!

57:05.489 --> 57:07.491
Go Brent. Go Brent.

57:07.591 --> 57:08.759
No man, I'm too white!

57:08.859 --> 57:11.495
Go Brent, go Brent!

57:14.231 --> 57:15.399
<i>To be</i>

57:15.499 --> 57:17.000
<i>or not to be.</i>

57:18.035 --> 57:19.236
That is the question.

57:21.005 --> 57:23.508
Whether 'tis nobler
in the mind to suffer

57:23.608 --> 57:26.711
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

57:26.811 --> 57:31.449
or to take arms against
the sea of troubles

57:31.549 --> 57:33.717
and by opposing, end them.

57:35.019 --> 57:36.019
To die.

57:36.921 --> 57:37.921
To sleep.

57:38.923 --> 57:41.459
And by asleep to say we end

57:41.559 --> 57:43.527
the thousand natural heartaches

57:43.627 --> 57:45.162
that flesh is heir to.

57:46.864 --> 57:49.900
'Tis a consummation
devoutly wished.

57:50.000 --> 57:50.968
To die.

57:52.403 --> 57:53.570
To sleep.

57:56.440 --> 57:57.641
To sleep,

57:59.343 --> 58:00.677
perchance,

58:04.949 --> 58:06.116
perchance...

58:09.486 --> 58:10.421
Line?

58:10.521 --> 58:11.989
Yo!

58:18.162 --> 58:20.431
The champ is here!

58:20.531 --> 58:21.632
Where Brent at?

58:21.733 --> 58:23.167
Where Brent at? Hey Brent,
how'd I do, Brent?

58:23.267 --> 58:25.236
You did it!
Ooh, wee!

58:29.207 --> 58:32.510
Listen, I don't mean to
step on your toes or nothing,

58:32.610 --> 58:34.144
but I know
you haven't had time

58:34.245 --> 58:35.146
to prepare for your

58:35.246 --> 58:36.681
- parole board hearing.
-Mmm-hmm.

58:36.781 --> 58:38.415
- So I took the liberty to, uh...
-Liberty?

58:38.516 --> 58:39.918
...do some prep work.

58:40.018 --> 58:42.486
Man, what I told you
the last time
we talked about this shit?

58:42.586 --> 58:43.688
Oh, come on, man.

58:43.788 --> 58:45.957
All you gotta do is, like,
fill out the essay

58:46.057 --> 58:47.625
and I just need some
addresses that I don't have.

58:47.725 --> 58:48.793
Listen man,
how you sitting up here

58:48.893 --> 58:50.628
with all this faith
in the system?

58:50.728 --> 58:51.996
The system don't
give a fuck about us.

58:52.096 --> 58:54.532
The system that's trying
to keep you in here.

58:54.632 --> 58:57.334
Even with all the evidence
that you got

58:57.435 --> 58:59.069
to prove your innocence.

58:59.704 --> 59:01.038
What do I got bro?
I got nothing.

59:01.138 --> 59:02.273
They gonna slam me.

59:02.373 --> 59:03.908
What you trying
to tell me? They got you?

59:04.008 --> 59:05.242
- Who got me?
- Letting you think

59:05.342 --> 59:06.343
that you belong in here.

59:06.444 --> 59:07.945
- No, man.
- They got you.

59:08.046 --> 59:11.248
Well, what I got out there?
All my people in here.

59:12.450 --> 59:14.318
My son is in here, shit.

59:14.418 --> 59:15.520
Sometimes I think

59:15.620 --> 59:16.754
this might be the best place
for me right now.

59:16.854 --> 59:18.756
No, no. Don't say that shit.
Don't say that.

59:18.856 --> 59:20.391
That's what they
want you to think.

59:20.491 --> 59:21.425
They want you
to think you some

59:21.526 --> 59:22.860
motherfucking lapdog
or some shit.

59:22.961 --> 59:24.796
When you're not that
and you know you're not that.

59:24.896 --> 59:26.964
You know who you are?
You know who you are?

59:27.065 --> 59:30.167
Let me remind you,
you're a motherfucking wolf.

59:30.267 --> 59:31.235
All right?

59:31.335 --> 59:32.603
A wolf.

59:32.703 --> 59:34.372
Yo, listen man,
I heard sometimes

59:34.472 --> 59:35.707
you might not even
get a decision.

59:35.807 --> 59:37.775
You sitting on your bunk
waiting and waiting and shit.

59:37.875 --> 59:38.843
Not the truth, not the truth.

59:38.943 --> 59:40.777
What they give you
is a letter.

59:41.412 --> 59:42.680
Thick as a brick,

59:42.780 --> 59:44.348
you keeping your ass here.

59:44.949 --> 59:48.218
Light as a feather,
you're free.

59:49.720 --> 59:51.756
- Yeah?
-Yeah.

59:51.856 --> 59:54.858
I do all that shit right
there, man, and it don't work?

59:56.160 --> 59:57.528
You try again.

59:57.628 --> 59:59.096
And again.

59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.098
And again. And again.

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:03.200
- Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:00:07.538 --> 01:00:09.272
Well, how long
this essay gotta be?

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.543
That's my boy. That's my boy.

01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:14.312
Come on.

01:00:14.412 --> 01:00:16.747
They better let me out
off this bullshit too.

01:00:16.847 --> 01:00:18.782
Come on. Come on.

01:00:23.587 --> 01:00:24.555
I can't sleep.

01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:26.022
It's too hot.

01:00:26.724 --> 01:00:27.858
You're too hyped.

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.793
It's the play, man.

01:00:29.894 --> 01:00:31.628
Shit is wild, right?

01:00:31.728 --> 01:00:32.997
Yeah.

01:00:33.097 --> 01:00:36.700
Space and time and histories.

01:00:37.902 --> 01:00:40.337
And, I still haven't
cracked that whole

01:00:40.437 --> 01:00:42.439
time portal thing, but...

01:00:44.108 --> 01:00:47.311
you know
what's really fun though?

01:00:47.411 --> 01:00:48.145
What?

01:00:48.246 --> 01:00:50.514
Playing all those
characters and names

01:00:50.615 --> 01:00:53.584
in one piece,
'cause that's me, man.

01:00:53.684 --> 01:00:55.753
That's my whole life.

01:00:55.853 --> 01:00:58.322
It's like the name game thing.

01:00:58.422 --> 01:00:59.857
You remember Role Call?

01:00:59.957 --> 01:01:01.359
My name is...

01:01:01.459 --> 01:01:02.660
Yeah, but that's
what all the girls did.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.964
No, man, everybody
did that. Except for me.

01:01:07.064 --> 01:01:09.100
- I couldn't do it.
-  Why?

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.168
Name was
too damn long.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:12.336
Wait, wait, wait.

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:13.804
What's your whole name, man?

01:01:13.905 --> 01:01:15.906
Come on, man,
my government name?

01:01:16.007 --> 01:01:17.674
- Do I know your... Wait.
-Yeah.

01:01:17.775 --> 01:01:19.010
How many... What?

01:01:19.110 --> 01:01:24.114
My Christian name, Miguel
Francisco Benjamin Garcon.

01:01:25.283 --> 01:01:28.385
Benjamin? Is that
like Arabic or something?

01:01:28.485 --> 01:01:29.687
Benjamin.

01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:33.657
Come on, man, you don't
know Spanish for shit.

01:01:33.757 --> 01:01:36.127
I mean, we're islanders.

01:01:36.227 --> 01:01:37.761
So I guess it
could be anything.

01:01:37.862 --> 01:01:39.930
But, you know, the only thing

01:01:40.031 --> 01:01:42.466
I answered to
growing up, though,

01:01:42.566 --> 01:01:43.867
Miguelito.

01:01:44.969 --> 01:01:46.603
That's what my
grandmother called me.

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:48.171
Miguelito.

01:01:48.739 --> 01:01:51.341
She was my word and my God, man.

01:01:51.442 --> 01:01:55.112
Miguelito. Mm-hmm.

01:01:55.213 --> 01:01:57.247
You remember the clique
I came with, right?

01:01:57.348 --> 01:01:58.549
There was two Mikes.

01:01:58.650 --> 01:02:02.586
So they thought it was, like,
Mike and then I was Mike Mike.

01:02:02.686 --> 01:02:03.888
But nah.

01:02:03.988 --> 01:02:08.458
You know, G, that came
from outside, from before.

01:02:09.894 --> 01:02:12.863
When I used to be high, high.

01:02:12.964 --> 01:02:17.702
They say, "Mike do his dope
for Mike."

01:02:17.802 --> 01:02:19.970
And then he always
come right back again

01:02:20.071 --> 01:02:24.575
and do more dope for Mike,
so Mike Mike.

01:02:25.776 --> 01:02:27.544
Yeah, man.
That shit was so nice,

01:02:27.645 --> 01:02:29.212
I had to do it twice.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:32.049
Yeah.

01:02:32.149 --> 01:02:33.116
And more.

01:02:33.784 --> 01:02:34.985
And more.

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:37.387
Hoo.

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:40.257
I was fucked up.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.501
I really did fuck up, man.

01:02:54.972 --> 01:02:57.574
That was the one thing
that broke my grandma.

01:03:00.944 --> 01:03:02.112
Drugs and me.

01:03:06.850 --> 01:03:08.118
But that's me, man.

01:03:10.754 --> 01:03:12.355
That's what I work on in here.

01:03:13.657 --> 01:03:15.125
That's why I'm good in here.

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:18.428
I mean,

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:19.496
I'm here...

01:03:20.764 --> 01:03:21.932
and I'm good.

01:03:25.136 --> 01:03:27.872
You know
they called me...

01:03:27.972 --> 01:03:30.708
a couple names
in the neighborhood.

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:32.042
They called me Mix Machine.

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:33.577
- Yeah.
-My DJ name.

01:03:33.677 --> 01:03:34.779
Yep.

01:03:34.879 --> 01:03:37.815
And then
they called me, uh...

01:03:37.915 --> 01:03:39.116
you know, they call me
Divine G in here,

01:03:39.216 --> 01:03:41.318
but they called me
Davey at home.

01:03:41.418 --> 01:03:42.453
Davey.

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:46.290
Yeah, Davey,
when I was at the Fame school.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:48.092
The High School of Performing
Arts in Manhattan.

01:03:48.192 --> 01:03:49.993
- Ooh.
-For dancing.

01:03:50.761 --> 01:03:52.963
You mean the Irene Cara thing?

01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:55.065
So you was Leroy?

01:03:55.165 --> 01:03:56.801
No, I wasn't Leroy,

01:03:56.901 --> 01:03:58.336
but there were a whole
lot of Leroys there.

01:03:58.436 --> 01:04:00.904
But let me tell you, those
Leroys could dance and fight.

01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:02.339
- Okay?
-You danced?

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:03.307
Me and my boys. What?

01:04:03.407 --> 01:04:04.608
-You danced too?
- Yeah, I danced.

01:04:04.708 --> 01:04:06.677
I danced modern and ballet.

01:04:06.777 --> 01:04:07.845
-Hmm, tutus...
- And ballet

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:09.013
was not what you think
it is, all right?

01:04:09.113 --> 01:04:10.114
- Ballet is like...
-The tutus

01:04:10.214 --> 01:04:12.182
- and everything, right?
- ...disciplined.

01:04:12.282 --> 01:04:14.919
It is, um... It's physical.

01:04:15.019 --> 01:04:17.988
It's strong. It's like
football, to be honest.

01:04:18.089 --> 01:04:21.191
It takes a lot of focus
and dedication.

01:04:22.359 --> 01:04:24.995
Man, I used to love to do that.

01:04:25.096 --> 01:04:27.865
But I couldn't because I
had to fight every day.

01:04:27.965 --> 01:04:29.400
Once the fellas found out
in the neighborhood,

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.302
I'd be fighting every
time I went home, man.

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:33.370
"Yo,

01:04:33.471 --> 01:04:35.906
"you wear them tights.
Yo, faggot, whatever."

01:04:36.006 --> 01:04:37.975
Like, everybody
thinks something about you

01:04:38.075 --> 01:04:39.476
just because you dance.

01:04:42.479 --> 01:04:44.014
I gave it up, man.

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.952
Man, the things you give up.

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:56.292
Yeah, I miss it.

01:04:59.196 --> 01:05:02.665
Man... if I only
stayed with it, man.

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:05.736
I ain't thinking
about that, you know,

01:05:05.836 --> 01:05:07.170
you can't look back.

01:05:08.706 --> 01:05:11.241
What if I kept, what if I did?

01:05:14.811 --> 01:05:16.012
Mike Mike?

01:05:17.848 --> 01:05:19.617
Oh, man.

01:05:19.717 --> 01:05:22.820
All right, I listen to
your bullshit stories

01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:25.388
about being called
Benjamin and whatnot.

01:05:29.493 --> 01:05:30.460
Good night.

01:05:55.819 --> 01:05:58.088
Yeah, I'm still here.

01:05:58.188 --> 01:06:00.357
Where's the body?

01:06:00.458 --> 01:06:02.926
I don't know, they
bagged it before my shift.

01:06:03.027 --> 01:06:04.761
Didn't have
much property so...

01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:07.798
Well,
don't be late for lunch.

01:06:07.898 --> 01:06:09.199
I ain't gonna
wait on you all day.

01:06:09.299 --> 01:06:11.068
Yeah, I know.

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:41.698
I could understand
a person hanging up.

01:06:43.267 --> 01:06:45.702
I could even understand
a person getting stabbed.

01:06:47.905 --> 01:06:49.506
But a brain aneurysm?

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:52.375
I don't get it.

01:06:58.816 --> 01:07:01.452
You know, when they called me
down to the chapel

01:07:01.552 --> 01:07:03.686
and let me know
my mom had passed,

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:08.492
I sat in the audience

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:10.294
while RTA
was putting on a show.

01:07:10.394 --> 01:07:13.497
Mike Mike was on stage,
you know,

01:07:13.598 --> 01:07:16.833
every performance after that,
I came down and watched him.

01:07:17.801 --> 01:07:19.269
Mike Mike brought me in.

01:07:26.844 --> 01:07:29.746
I guess Mike Mike's gonna
finally visit the Island.

01:07:42.192 --> 01:07:43.160
Is there
anything you need

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.495
to talk about, bro?

01:07:44.595 --> 01:07:46.463
Everything that needed to be
said got said, right?

01:07:47.631 --> 01:07:48.766
I'm only asking,
bro, because you ain't

01:07:48.866 --> 01:07:50.334
having much to say when
we was in the circle.

01:07:50.434 --> 01:07:51.734
What's that supposed to mean?

01:07:55.239 --> 01:07:56.473
G, I don't mean no disrespect
or nothing.

01:07:56.574 --> 01:07:59.210
I'm always here
for you, if you ever need me.

01:07:59.310 --> 01:08:01.912
I got a dozen letters to
write to his family tonight.

01:08:02.013 --> 01:08:05.215
What I need to do right now
is finish with these chairs.

01:08:08.285 --> 01:08:11.421
All right, man, listen,
my bad. Peace.

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:47.958
Ahoy, mateys!

01:08:48.058 --> 01:08:52.028
I think I spy a ship
on the horizon.

01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:54.798
Nah, that's not a ship.

01:08:54.898 --> 01:08:56.399
It's a sailboat.

01:09:01.672 --> 01:09:03.940
<i>No, no, no, Mom.
That's not what I'm saying.</i>

01:09:04.041 --> 01:09:05.142
But you just have to tell them

01:09:05.242 --> 01:09:06.243
that they can't
talk to you like that.

01:09:06.343 --> 01:09:07.577
That's all I'm trying to say.

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:10.581
Well, if you're not gonna
do anything about it

01:09:10.681 --> 01:09:11.949
then I don't even know
why we're...

01:09:12.049 --> 01:09:14.885
I don't know why we're talking
about it then, all right?

01:09:14.985 --> 01:09:16.653
Just let them
run over you then.

01:09:19.356 --> 01:09:21.124
Oh, man. Ma, I'm sorry.

01:09:26.930 --> 01:09:27.965
No, no, I'm not nervous.

01:09:28.065 --> 01:09:29.366
I'm just ready for it
to be done.

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:32.369
I'm just, you know,
just waiting.

01:09:38.542 --> 01:09:40.844
I'm just ready to see you, Mom.

01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:46.416
I'm ready to see you.

01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:53.156
Mr. Whitfield.

01:09:53.256 --> 01:09:55.192
This is a clemency hearing

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:58.295
for your conviction of
murder in the second

01:09:58.395 --> 01:10:00.097
as well as weapons possession.

01:10:00.197 --> 01:10:02.566
Two counts on each,
25 to life.

01:10:02.666 --> 01:10:05.735
Two to seven, and
five to 15 respectively.

01:10:05.835 --> 01:10:06.836
That is correct.

01:10:08.004 --> 01:10:09.105
Okay.

01:10:15.479 --> 01:10:16.647
I will note at the outset

01:10:16.747 --> 01:10:20.384
that we were able to acquire
the sentencing minutes

01:10:20.484 --> 01:10:23.720
and they will be considered
as well as your parole packet.

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:24.721
Yes.

01:10:24.822 --> 01:10:25.956
But we are talking about

01:10:26.056 --> 01:10:30.427
the March 25th, 1988 homicide
of Randall Birch.

01:10:30.528 --> 01:10:33.396
He had been shot many times
in the head and body, correct?

01:10:34.364 --> 01:10:36.032
As far as I understand.

01:10:36.133 --> 01:10:38.201
And in terms of this offense,

01:10:38.302 --> 01:10:41.071
you have exhausted
your appeals.

01:10:41.171 --> 01:10:42.172
- Yes.
-You had

01:10:42.272 --> 01:10:43.507
the Innocence Project
look at it.

01:10:43.607 --> 01:10:45.642
Legal Aid.
You hired an investigator.

01:10:45.743 --> 01:10:48.912
Apparently you've raised
other issues of, um,

01:10:49.012 --> 01:10:51.682
prosecutorial and police
department misconduct.

01:10:51.782 --> 01:10:55.352
And there were some other
exculpatory statements

01:10:55.452 --> 01:10:56.553
made by another person

01:10:56.653 --> 01:10:58.822
that were never given
to you for your trial.

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:01.291
Another man confessed
to the crime on that tape,

01:11:01.392 --> 01:11:03.260
but it was buried along
with other key evidence.

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:06.429
Yes, and that's
part of the issue.

01:11:06.530 --> 01:11:07.764
It's been next to impossible

01:11:07.865 --> 01:11:10.633
for us
to authenticate the validity.

01:11:11.802 --> 01:11:14.972
The person who
made it is deceased

01:11:15.072 --> 01:11:18.308
and we can't get the DA's
office to return our calls.

01:11:18.408 --> 01:11:19.610
I don't know how...
what I can...

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:20.844
You
understand that this creates

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:24.046
a complicated legal issue,
don't you?

01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:28.418
- Yes. But I...
- Since you've been in custody,

01:11:28.519 --> 01:11:31.188
you've been involved
in numerous programs.

01:11:31.288 --> 01:11:33.991
It's too long a list
for me to go through.

01:11:34.091 --> 01:11:37.761
But I do have a question
about the theater program.

01:11:37.861 --> 01:11:40.797
You've been involved in that
many years, have you not?

01:11:40.897 --> 01:11:41.798
Yes. Uh, yes ma'am.

01:11:41.899 --> 01:11:45.535
I am a founding member
of this program.

01:11:45.636 --> 01:11:46.870
It's something
I'm very proud of.

01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.671
And what part do you play

01:11:48.772 --> 01:11:49.706
in this program?

01:11:49.806 --> 01:11:51.241
Actor? Director?

01:11:51.341 --> 01:11:52.476
Well, we all do a few things.

01:11:52.576 --> 01:11:54.511
I'm on what is called
the Steering Committee.

01:11:54.612 --> 01:11:58.615
We make a lot of decisions
for how it operates, and...

01:11:58.715 --> 01:12:01.785
from time to time
I do act, like we all do,

01:12:01.885 --> 01:12:06.323
and um... it's been a program
that was established

01:12:06.423 --> 01:12:09.526
to help the population
with management skills.

01:12:09.627 --> 01:12:13.663
And it's turned into something
a bit more, I don't know,

01:12:14.331 --> 01:12:17.467
wonderful,
because it helps people

01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:18.669
get more in touch
with their feelings

01:12:18.769 --> 01:12:21.471
and able to process
and actually move through

01:12:21.571 --> 01:12:24.875
and truly get
some rehabilitation.

01:12:24.975 --> 01:12:28.411
So are you acting at all
during this interview?

01:12:34.351 --> 01:12:36.052
Absolutely not. Uh...

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:40.557
I truly hope that
you can understand

01:12:40.657 --> 01:12:42.292
that I've been very sincere.

01:12:42.392 --> 01:12:44.894
I know how meaningful this is.

01:12:44.994 --> 01:12:45.929
I would never...

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:48.832
Actually, that's not
the intention of acting.

01:12:48.932 --> 01:12:51.935
Acting is just to, you know, process.

01:12:52.035 --> 01:12:53.135
I read about the program.

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:55.037
It's a good program.

01:12:56.206 --> 01:12:57.340
Okay.

01:12:58.008 --> 01:13:00.409
Any other questions
from the board?

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:05.282
Well, thank you,
Mr. Whitfield.

01:13:05.382 --> 01:13:07.350
We'll take all of this
into account

01:13:07.451 --> 01:13:10.152
and deliver our decision
in two weeks.

01:14:18.254 --> 01:14:19.655
You're going home.

01:14:21.357 --> 01:14:22.558
Yeah.

01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.194
I can hardly believe it.

01:14:25.662 --> 01:14:27.129
It don't even seem real.

01:14:34.437 --> 01:14:35.805
What about you?

01:14:57.894 --> 01:15:00.296
I wouldn't even be here
without you, beloved.

01:15:02.399 --> 01:15:03.833
Thank you for everything.

01:15:11.975 --> 01:15:14.076
C'mon,
they're waiting for you.

01:15:32.596 --> 01:15:34.564
The tree costume
is great.

01:15:34.664 --> 01:15:37.233
This looks perfect,
don't lose any of those.

01:15:40.937 --> 01:15:42.605
Reach for the sky, Marshall.

01:15:43.974 --> 01:15:46.175
You look just like Gary
Cooper, you know that?

01:15:46.276 --> 01:15:47.276
- My lady!
- Hey!

01:15:47.377 --> 01:15:48.445
You've arrived!

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:50.080
- So good to have you here.
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

01:15:50.180 --> 01:15:51.414
- We'll talk? We'll talk later.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:15:51.514 --> 01:15:52.582
We got it.

01:15:52.682 --> 01:15:54.684
Ah!

01:15:58.688 --> 01:15:59.923
I told you I was no ghoul.

01:16:00.023 --> 01:16:01.924
I'm happy as the
Gravedigger now.

01:16:02.025 --> 01:16:02.826
Thank you.

01:16:02.926 --> 01:16:04.895
15 years since
I put on a suit.

01:16:04.995 --> 01:16:07.730
And you look good champ
but can I get this mirror?

01:16:14.905 --> 01:16:18.208
Take this sacred amulet
and wear it.

01:16:18.308 --> 01:16:20.810
You will need it before
your journey's end.

01:16:29.519 --> 01:16:31.120
<i>Well, we made it.</i>

01:16:31.821 --> 01:16:33.389
Still a lot more work to do.

01:16:35.359 --> 01:16:40.364
Dress rehearsal, this is when
you guys get to grow.

01:16:41.965 --> 01:16:43.566
It's when the director
kind of lets go

01:16:43.666 --> 01:16:45.935
and lets you guys take over.

01:16:46.836 --> 01:16:49.305
So don't be afraid
to try things.

01:16:49.405 --> 01:16:51.608
No acting allowed.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:54.544
A lot of listening,
let's listen to each other.

01:16:54.644 --> 01:16:56.212
Let's support each other.

01:16:57.748 --> 01:17:01.218
I want to thank you guys
for trusting the process.

01:17:01.318 --> 01:17:03.820
I know we're thinking
about Mike Mike right now.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.890
And I want you to know,
I got a feeling Mike Mike

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:09.058
has not left the building.

01:17:10.227 --> 01:17:12.261
So we're gonna do this
for Mike Mike.

01:17:13.930 --> 01:17:14.998
Let's go, man.
Bring it on in here.

01:17:15.098 --> 01:17:16.633
- Bring it in.
-Everybody.

01:17:16.733 --> 01:17:18.568
-All right. Yep. Yep.
- We got it?

01:17:18.668 --> 01:17:20.203
One, two, three.

01:17:20.303 --> 01:17:21.504
RTA!

01:17:21.604 --> 01:17:23.272
- Yeah. Yeah.
-Whoo!

01:17:40.657 --> 01:17:42.825
I am Alotincommon.

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:48.464
I am the high priest of Egypt
from the year...

01:17:48.998 --> 01:17:50.833
Hell, it was a long time ago.

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:55.839
Sweet Egyptian
Princess Neotali

01:17:55.939 --> 01:17:58.240
has been the victim
of a murder,

01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:02.245
a crime most foul.

01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:08.084
She was a good mummy,
to her little one she named,

01:18:08.251 --> 01:18:09.218
Leslie.

01:18:13.456 --> 01:18:14.724
Mummy?

01:18:14.824 --> 01:18:17.092
Mummy? Is that you?

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:20.630
Oh, Mummy, I miss you so.

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:22.965
Now I am a prisoner.

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.168
Yes.

01:18:25.269 --> 01:18:30.274
Now I feel the galling weight
of these disgraceful chains.

01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:33.710
And so
the young lovers set out

01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:38.381
on their journey seeking
something black and white,

01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:40.349
above water and sky.

01:18:53.663 --> 01:18:55.865
Oy!

01:18:55.966 --> 01:18:58.134
I think I found
her here, guv'nor.

01:18:58.234 --> 01:19:01.003
What a pretty mess
she turned out to be.

01:19:01.771 --> 01:19:02.972
Wait.

01:19:12.782 --> 01:19:14.951
Keep this with you always.

01:19:15.051 --> 01:19:16.152
Keep it near to your heart,

01:19:16.252 --> 01:19:18.187
so that you'll always
remember me.

01:19:40.076 --> 01:19:42.011
Yo, these are mine.

01:19:43.246 --> 01:19:45.581
My bad.

01:19:58.928 --> 01:20:00.029
Zakariedies' got me locked

01:20:00.129 --> 01:20:01.898
into a 25 year
no pay contract.

01:20:01.998 --> 01:20:03.199
If I don't do what he says

01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:04.367
and be his
number one gladiator,

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:06.102
he's gonna kill my wife
and daughters,

01:20:06.202 --> 01:20:07.836
and feed me to the lions.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:11.741
Line?

01:20:11.841 --> 01:20:13.476
We sure could
have used you

01:20:13.576 --> 01:20:16.112
for some serious backup.

01:20:16.980 --> 01:20:19.649
Why, we sure could use
you for some serious backup.

01:20:19.749 --> 01:20:22.218
Yeah, we sure coulda used
you for some serious backup.

01:20:22.318 --> 01:20:23.253
And then I say...

01:20:23.353 --> 01:20:27.157
Never fear!
Gladiator Goliathan is here.

01:20:27.257 --> 01:20:31.827
I'll smash 'em and bash 'em,
whether short or tall.

01:20:31.927 --> 01:20:33.229
Got it?

01:20:33.330 --> 01:20:36.966
And then I come out and
say the most profound line.

01:20:37.067 --> 01:20:40.570
If you help me escape,
consider it done.

01:20:40.670 --> 01:20:43.739
And remember everybody
say it like it's really funny,

01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:44.874
'cause it's a comedy.

01:20:44.974 --> 01:20:47.843
Ha, ha, ha.
It's a fucking comedy, yeah.

01:20:56.152 --> 01:20:57.453
Uh.

01:20:57.553 --> 01:20:58.520
Okay, men.

01:20:59.822 --> 01:21:01.490
- Let's take five.
- Why?

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:02.925
Why Brent?

01:21:03.026 --> 01:21:04.127
Like it's gonna
fucking matter?

01:21:04.227 --> 01:21:05.562
Like we're gonna
get any fucking better?

01:21:05.662 --> 01:21:08.565
Like he's gonna remember
any fucking line he has?

01:21:08.665 --> 01:21:11.000
You tell us to trust
the fucking process, right?

01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:13.102
Well, the process is fucked!

01:21:15.205 --> 01:21:16.973
I think we need
more than five, Brent,

01:21:17.073 --> 01:21:18.041
for him to learn
his fucking lines.

01:21:18.141 --> 01:21:19.075
Hey, c'mon, brother.
Let's take a walk.

01:21:19.175 --> 01:21:20.776
Yo, get the fuck off of me.

01:21:20.877 --> 01:21:21.844
The fuck you gonna do?

01:21:21.945 --> 01:21:24.580
You gonna step? You wanna step?

01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.647
Yeah?

01:21:27.817 --> 01:21:29.585
What the fuck
are you wearing, man?

01:21:29.686 --> 01:21:31.053
What the fuck are we doing?

01:21:32.555 --> 01:21:35.558
This silly bullshit we do
every fucking six months,

01:21:35.659 --> 01:21:39.062
as if it fucking matters, man.
And we're still fucked.

01:21:39.162 --> 01:21:41.530
We're still right back
where we fucking start.

01:21:50.906 --> 01:21:52.474
Are you done?

01:21:52.575 --> 01:21:53.542
No.

01:21:58.080 --> 01:21:59.348
I'm not done.

01:22:02.952 --> 01:22:04.586
Isn't that fucking hilarious?

01:22:36.119 --> 01:22:38.621
Yo, this is gonna set
us back for how long now?

01:22:38.721 --> 01:22:39.755
He walked away.

01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:41.090
He just walked away.

01:22:41.190 --> 01:22:42.291
You can't do that.

01:22:42.392 --> 01:22:44.127
We're all going through stuff.

01:22:44.227 --> 01:22:46.062
This is about
acting professionally.

01:22:46.162 --> 01:22:48.297
We're in the middle
of a production.

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:52.001
We all have breaking points.

01:22:52.101 --> 01:22:54.304
Listen, we all understand
breaking points.

01:22:54.404 --> 01:22:56.906
We've all been through
our own breaking points,

01:22:57.006 --> 01:23:00.776
yet we show up and we do
what we have to do.

01:23:01.844 --> 01:23:03.045
You have to.

01:24:38.441 --> 01:24:41.310
<i>So I want you to
picture in your mind's eye</i>

01:24:42.812 --> 01:24:44.580
a very dear and old friend

01:24:44.681 --> 01:24:47.182
that you haven't seen
for a very long time,

01:24:48.151 --> 01:24:50.185
but you'd love
to see him again.

01:24:53.155 --> 01:24:55.458
So what does that look like?

01:24:55.558 --> 01:24:57.360
And what does he look like?

01:24:57.460 --> 01:25:00.495
Is he taller now or shorter?

01:25:01.631 --> 01:25:03.632
Does he still got
the same haircut?

01:25:05.034 --> 01:25:06.802
Maybe he needs a shave.

01:25:09.673 --> 01:25:12.775
Maybe he looks a little bit
different, a little bit older.

01:25:12.875 --> 01:25:14.176
We're all getting older.

01:25:15.512 --> 01:25:19.648
Have that brotherly feeling
of love and safeness.

01:25:20.883 --> 01:25:22.217
What would that be like?

01:25:23.285 --> 01:25:24.653
Should be joyful.

01:25:25.988 --> 01:25:27.456
Should be wonderful.

01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:32.661
You know?

01:25:34.230 --> 01:25:36.865
Just to be with that person
one more time.

01:25:43.406 --> 01:25:45.808
You can open your eyes now.

01:25:45.908 --> 01:25:47.076
Was it me?

01:25:51.914 --> 01:25:54.216
Oh, what's good, boys?

01:25:54.317 --> 01:25:56.218
Oh, man, it's good to see y'all.

01:25:56.319 --> 01:25:58.287
Yo, good to see you, man.

01:25:58.387 --> 01:26:00.356
Dapper Dapper,
you still here, bro?

01:26:00.456 --> 01:26:02.458
Tell us
what's going on outside, man.

01:26:02.558 --> 01:26:03.826
Oh, man.

01:26:03.926 --> 01:26:05.728
The world, man.

01:26:05.828 --> 01:26:09.499
I get up, 4:30
I'm in that bakery, man.

01:26:09.599 --> 01:26:14.603
Pumping out donuts,
cheesecake. Grinding.

01:26:14.838 --> 01:26:18.574
But, man, I take so much joy
in just being out at night,

01:26:18.675 --> 01:26:21.110
you know what I'm saying?
Like, it's summertime,

01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:23.313
10 o'clock at night,
you know what I mean?

01:26:23.413 --> 01:26:25.848
You go to the basket and still
seeing kids out there.

01:26:25.948 --> 01:26:27.450
Remember how we used
to play ball at night?

01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:29.051
Like, you go to
the schoolyard
or wherever at night

01:26:29.151 --> 01:26:30.252
and play ball and whatnot.

01:26:30.353 --> 01:26:32.288
Bam, I just walk past.
See the...

01:26:32.388 --> 01:26:33.890
Oh, man, you know.

01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:38.761
But then my greatest joy,
my greatest joy, right?

01:26:38.861 --> 01:26:42.064
It's washing my car,
going to the car wash,

01:26:42.164 --> 01:26:44.366
getting that baby
spit fine clean,

01:26:45.968 --> 01:26:47.703
finding me a destination.

01:26:49.005 --> 01:26:52.541
Go grab my dog,
put my road dog on the side,

01:26:53.476 --> 01:26:57.780
throw my jazz on,
hit the road at 60,

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:01.283
throw that cruise on
and let everything else go.

01:27:01.384 --> 01:27:02.618
I got up the other day, man,

01:27:02.719 --> 01:27:04.487
at two o'clock in the morning
and made some pancakes

01:27:04.587 --> 01:27:07.189
and grits and shit
just because I could.

01:27:09.225 --> 01:27:10.559
That feel good as hell.

01:27:11.594 --> 01:27:13.395
On another note though, right?

01:27:14.397 --> 01:27:15.997
I just had to put my dog down.

01:27:16.965 --> 01:27:18.501
Hey.

01:27:18.601 --> 01:27:22.771
I had a 85 pound red nose
pit bull named Girly.

01:27:23.806 --> 01:27:25.441
That bitch,
all she wanted to do,

01:27:25.541 --> 01:27:27.343
she thought she was a lap dog.

01:27:27.443 --> 01:27:29.545
She just wanna lay in your lap
and eat Scooby snacks.

01:27:29.645 --> 01:27:33.615
You know what I'm saying?
She just wanna play.

01:27:34.851 --> 01:27:39.288
But, um, she was sick
and I didn't know.

01:27:39.388 --> 01:27:40.789
And so,

01:27:42.291 --> 01:27:43.526
her nose started bleeding.

01:27:43.626 --> 01:27:46.328
She was...
She was the only one

01:27:46.429 --> 01:27:47.530
that was really
happy to see me

01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:49.432
when I walked
through the door.

01:27:49.532 --> 01:27:51.567
You know what I mean?
She, uh...

01:27:51.668 --> 01:27:53.736
She looked... the day that
we had to put her down,

01:27:53.836 --> 01:27:56.305
I couldn't really...
I couldn't go.

01:27:56.406 --> 01:28:00.375
'Cause I'm not gonna watch
nobody walk my dog off.

01:28:05.615 --> 01:28:08.417
She was suffering,
she was suffering.

01:28:11.454 --> 01:28:13.855
This emotional
rollercoaster, man, is really...

01:28:15.625 --> 01:28:17.693
it's really something else.
And it don't hit you at first

01:28:17.794 --> 01:28:20.630
'cause everything is...
Everything is lovely.

01:28:20.730 --> 01:28:23.632
You know what I mean?
It's cotton candy, baby.

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:25.568
You know, peaches and cream.

01:28:25.668 --> 01:28:26.669
First years out, you get...

01:28:26.769 --> 01:28:28.737
It's exciting
getting to know them.

01:28:29.605 --> 01:28:32.808
But then, you know,
you settle down.

01:28:32.909 --> 01:28:36.012
You find out you
got these feelings, man.

01:28:36.112 --> 01:28:40.349
And everybody want a piece
of your feelings, you know?

01:28:40.449 --> 01:28:45.454
And because you care,
you open up.

01:28:45.588 --> 01:28:48.089
And that's when the hurting
come on in, you know.

01:28:49.091 --> 01:28:50.159
But, uh, yeah,

01:28:50.259 --> 01:28:51.494
Brent asked me to come in

01:28:51.594 --> 01:28:53.429
'cause y'all got this
production coming up

01:28:53.529 --> 01:28:55.765
and here I am
with all this heavy shit

01:28:55.865 --> 01:28:57.934
sucking the air
out of the room, right?

01:28:58.034 --> 01:29:00.369
- Oh, man. But listen...
-It's all right.

01:29:00.469 --> 01:29:01.770
It's real.

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:02.905
Yeah.

01:29:03.005 --> 01:29:05.274
I appreciate that, man.

01:29:05.374 --> 01:29:07.510
So on that vein, yo...

01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:11.214
But you think maybe like
we could do a exercise

01:29:11.314 --> 01:29:14.583
or something so I could be
reinvigorated, re-energized?

01:29:14.684 --> 01:29:16.052
Definitely, man,
let's get up on our feet.

01:29:16.152 --> 01:29:18.654
This ain't no goddamn
sewing circle, come on.

01:29:18.754 --> 01:29:20.223
Yeah, that's
what I'm talking about.

01:29:20.323 --> 01:29:22.825
So let's shake up this
space for brother Charlie.

01:29:22.925 --> 01:29:25.861
Let's walk around,
let's walk around here.

01:29:25.961 --> 01:29:27.163
Let's walk it out...

01:29:27.263 --> 01:29:29.965
What it's like when the air
is really heavy and hot?

01:30:03.900 --> 01:30:06.102
You know, I was artistic
as a kid, you know.

01:30:06.202 --> 01:30:09.438
Used to draw, paint... like
those little geese right there

01:30:09.538 --> 01:30:10.739
and everything.

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:12.774
Man.

01:30:14.309 --> 01:30:15.510
That was dope.

01:30:20.415 --> 01:30:21.616
Yeah, man.

01:30:23.653 --> 01:30:26.588
Mom used to try
to tell me to paint a lot

01:30:26.689 --> 01:30:28.523
and I skipped over that.

01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:32.027
You know where
that landed me, so...

01:30:34.897 --> 01:30:36.032
I got a label.

01:30:36.132 --> 01:30:41.137
Everybody perceived me to be
a thug, a gangster, whatever.

01:30:41.404 --> 01:30:43.772
And that kind of like
put me in a box

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:46.608
and you don't have a box.

01:30:48.377 --> 01:30:50.145
Everywhere I saw you
at in the jail,

01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:51.480
you always was Divine G

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.682
and you was free to be that

01:30:53.783 --> 01:30:55.250
because you
didn't have a label.

01:30:56.585 --> 01:30:59.888
And I see that
you need help, bro.

01:31:00.856 --> 01:31:02.557
But you won't ask for it.

01:31:04.727 --> 01:31:07.630
You got all of us here,
man. We love you, bro.

01:31:07.730 --> 01:31:09.165
We gonna do anything
we can for you.

01:31:09.265 --> 01:31:14.270
But you refuse to extend your
hand to ask for help, bro.

01:31:14.537 --> 01:31:17.272
As many brothers as you
helped in here.

01:31:28.183 --> 01:31:29.785
I fucked up.

01:31:29.885 --> 01:31:32.020
Yeah, you did,
you fucked up.

01:31:33.689 --> 01:31:34.723
But, you know, we all know you.

01:31:34.824 --> 01:31:36.992
We all love you
and we took a vote.

01:31:38.261 --> 01:31:41.463
Yeah, everybody's willing
to take you back right now

01:31:41.563 --> 01:31:43.932
under one condition.

01:31:45.267 --> 01:31:46.301
What is that?

01:31:47.269 --> 01:31:49.105
Well...

01:31:49.205 --> 01:31:53.175
you gotta, you gotta admit
wholeheartedly,

01:31:53.275 --> 01:31:54.843
possibly even in writing

01:31:56.145 --> 01:31:58.847
that I murdered that
Hamlet scene, bro.

01:32:00.149 --> 01:32:01.083
I mean listen, man,

01:32:01.183 --> 01:32:04.486
the dude Shakespeare is
in his grave right now.

01:32:04.587 --> 01:32:07.189
He rolled over
just to hear that magic

01:32:07.289 --> 01:32:08.690
I put on that thing, man.

01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:13.161
You did your thing, beloved.

01:32:13.262 --> 01:32:15.163
Yes, I did, beloved.

01:32:25.574 --> 01:32:27.909
Everybody, let's just
take a cleansing,

01:32:28.010 --> 01:32:29.044
deep breath.

01:32:31.647 --> 01:32:33.982
Just let it all go.

01:32:38.554 --> 01:32:40.589
Who would have thunk,

01:32:40.690 --> 01:32:43.359
that the beginning of
the healing for this planet

01:32:43.459 --> 01:32:46.861
would start right here
behind the walls of Sing Sing.

01:32:53.135 --> 01:32:57.772
Anybody else have anything
they want to add right now?

01:33:00.542 --> 01:33:01.610
Yes, sir.

01:33:07.950 --> 01:33:10.786
Sometimes
it's just all a little

01:33:10.886 --> 01:33:13.188
too much on the heart.

01:33:15.324 --> 01:33:16.624
But that's no excuse.

01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:20.028
And I hope that
you could forgive me.

01:33:26.068 --> 01:33:27.736
Bring it in, RTA.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:27.837 --> 01:33:28.737
Gimme those hands.
Gimme those hands.

01:33:28.837 --> 01:33:30.138
- All right, all right.
- All right?

01:33:30.239 --> 01:33:31.840
One, two, three.

01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:33.374
RTA!

01:34:07.009 --> 01:34:08.677
Yo, B block,
they was loving it.

01:34:08.777 --> 01:34:10.312
Yeah, see, the comedy...

01:34:10.412 --> 01:34:11.680
Comedies are different, man.

01:34:11.780 --> 01:34:13.082
D-DAN: Yeah.
That was a little hard

01:34:13.182 --> 01:34:14.483
but it was... it's different,
it had a different hit.

01:34:14.583 --> 01:34:16.184
D-DAN: And Carmine, yo,

01:34:16.285 --> 01:34:17.219
he came around in that

01:34:17.319 --> 01:34:18.487
- Gravedigger, didn't he?
-Gravedigger, yeah.

01:34:18.587 --> 01:34:19.454
He definitely did.
D-DAN: Yeah!

01:34:19.555 --> 01:34:20.556
You're right about that.

01:34:20.656 --> 01:34:23.358
Carmine did,
Blackseed, Winter, Tye.

01:34:23.459 --> 01:34:24.726
All of them did their thing.

01:34:24.826 --> 01:34:25.894
The cast stepped up.

01:34:25.995 --> 01:34:27.563
Yeah, the cast definitely
stepped up.

01:34:27.663 --> 01:34:29.031
And I still don't
understand time travel.

01:34:29.131 --> 01:34:30.099
We did all that,
I still don't understand.

01:34:30.199 --> 01:34:31.467
I don't think
we'll ever understand.

01:34:31.567 --> 01:34:32.634
D-DAN: From pirates and... yeah.
I don't know how

01:34:32.735 --> 01:34:34.836
it got from Robin Hood
to pirates

01:34:34.937 --> 01:34:36.205
and then all over the place.

01:34:36.305 --> 01:34:37.639
D-DAN: All over the place.
That's the craziest thing.

01:34:37.739 --> 01:34:39.742
We were all over the place

01:34:39.842 --> 01:34:41.910
and the population was
still able to follow it.

01:34:42.011 --> 01:34:43.112
D-DAN: They enjoyed it.
They enjoyed it.

01:34:43.212 --> 01:34:45.213
-They got all that in there.
- D-DAN: Right.

01:34:45.313 --> 01:34:46.215
Shakespeare.

01:34:46.315 --> 01:34:49.751
D-DAN: But fellas,
what are we gonna do next?

01:34:51.453 --> 01:34:52.555
It's too hard to top.

01:34:52.655 --> 01:34:53.789
What do you think Dap?
Yeah, it's hard to top,

01:34:53.889 --> 01:34:54.923
I don't know, man.

01:34:55.023 --> 01:34:56.592
Divine, what you got for us?

01:34:56.692 --> 01:34:58.393
You always keep
something in the stash.

01:34:58.494 --> 01:35:00.028
What you got
for us Divine G?

01:35:00.128 --> 01:35:01.096
Shit, what I got for you...

01:35:01.196 --> 01:35:02.298
I don't know,
I ain't got nothing.

01:35:02.398 --> 01:35:04.999
I know you keep
something in the stash.

01:35:06.202 --> 01:35:08.169
D-DAN: You always
working on something, man.

01:35:09.471 --> 01:35:12.875
How about my play, <i>Fine Print?</i>

01:35:12.975 --> 01:35:15.477
Wait, but it's a little
lost in the second act.

01:35:15.577 --> 01:35:16.545
But maybe I could...

01:35:16.645 --> 01:35:18.380
Come on,
you got something else.

01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.949
Wait, all right, how about...

01:35:20.049 --> 01:35:21.817
Man, I've been working on
this play for a couple years.

01:35:21.917 --> 01:35:23.117
Maybe it might work.

01:35:24.019 --> 01:35:25.120
It's called <i>Pro Se.</i>

01:35:25.221 --> 01:35:28.790
Now that's gonna
appeal to the population.

01:35:28.891 --> 01:35:30.592
It's a satire, man.

01:35:30.692 --> 01:35:32.094
It's about this
dude who's been

01:35:32.194 --> 01:35:34.629
like working out, you know?
Just hitting the gym...

01:39:40.108 --> 01:39:41.309
Come on.

01:39:46.481 --> 01:39:47.748
Come on, man.

01:40:05.234 --> 01:40:07.936
All right,
all right, we here man.

01:40:27.122 --> 01:40:28.356
It is different.

01:40:28.457 --> 01:40:30.926

<i>(LIKE A BIRD</i> BY
ABRAHAM ALEXANDER

01:40:42.904 --> 01:40:44.272
AND ADRIAN QUESADA PLAYING)

01:41:51.406 --> 01:41:52.907
I introduce to you

<i>Breakin' the Mummy's Code,</i>

01:42:00.882 --> 01:42:02.717
Mummy. Mummy.

01:42:02.817 --> 01:42:03.784
Is that you?

Now indeed I am a prisoner.

01:42:22.603 --> 01:42:23.739
Yes.

01:42:23.839 --> 01:42:28.643
Now I feel the galling weight
of these disgraceful chains!

01:42:53.201 --> 01:42:55.136
You know,
I'm really tired of this

01:42:55.236 --> 01:42:57.606
really miserable profession.

01:42:57.706 --> 01:43:01.543
I don't wanna be all mean
and tough no more.

01:43:01.643 --> 01:43:04.745
I want to be gentle and kind.

01:43:06.314 --> 01:43:07.749
Really?

01:43:07.849 --> 01:43:09.617
Me too.

01:43:15.057 --> 01:43:20.027
Keep this near to your heart
so that you will remember me.

01:43:20.128 --> 01:43:21.295
Always.

01:43:34.409 --> 01:43:36.243
Let's go, Horatio!
