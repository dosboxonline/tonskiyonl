00:25.609 --> 00:28.153
You are about to be privy to something

00:28.237 --> 00:31.615
that only a handful of people
in our history have had access to.

00:43.961 --> 00:45.128
After you.

01:22.541 --> 01:23.792
That should be enough.

01:23.876 --> 01:27.671
- Where are you keeping the rest of it?
- It's safe. Just be careful with it.

01:30.591 --> 01:31.592
Asshole.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.432
Thank you. Appreciate it.

01:42.186 --> 01:43.604
It's not much.

01:46.023 --> 01:47.608
We're Mechanical.

01:47.691 --> 01:49.902
We make a little go a long way, right?

01:51.904 --> 01:53.530
This is gonna make a difference.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.539
Tell 'em that's the last of it.

02:03.373 --> 02:05.876
State your name and new position.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.419
Lukas Kyle.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.047
IT shadow.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.592
Verified. Welcome, Lukas Kyle.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.428
The living quarters are that way.

02:17.179 --> 02:19.306
You will live here
while you familiarize yourself

02:19.389 --> 02:21.058
with the Legacy.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.560
The food is all right.
The bed is comfortable.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.377
- That's it. Careful.
- All right. Bring it over.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.420
- That's it.
- Easy.

02:51.255 --> 02:52.506
All set?

02:57.386 --> 02:59.596
The lights in the sky are called--

02:59.680 --> 03:00.931
Stars.

03:03.559 --> 03:05.227
That's what Judge Meadows said.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.358
All these relics,

03:12.734 --> 03:14.486
where did they come from?

03:15.612 --> 03:18.574
Technically, they're not relics.

03:18.657 --> 03:23.704
They are the whole of human history,
knowledge, art.

03:24.997 --> 03:30.669
The books you see here
are a fraction of the vault's library.

03:30.752 --> 03:32.045
All of these,

03:33.130 --> 03:35.132
and more than you can imagine,

03:35.215 --> 03:38.760
are stored digitally on this.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.348
When I was first handed that,

03:44.558 --> 03:48.437
I searched for answers to the questions
that we have all had.

03:49.188 --> 03:54.651
And all I could find was that the Silo
was built 352 years ago.

03:55.861 --> 04:00.616
Beyond that, nothing about
why it was built or why we are here.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.993
Right now, the only thing that matters

04:04.620 --> 04:07.497
is breaking Salvador Quinn's code.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.876
The stars will have to wait.

04:11.960 --> 04:15.797
So why would I want
to decipher the code now?

04:22.471 --> 04:25.516
It implies that there is a problem.

04:26.725 --> 04:30.812
Potentially unsolvable,
that you know nothing about.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.484
And a problem like that,

04:35.567 --> 04:39.655
especially one which Salvador Quinn went
to such great lengths to conceal…

04:41.949 --> 04:44.952
is potentially more dangerous
than the rebellion.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.995
Yes.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.123
How do I--

04:53.085 --> 04:54.336
Ask it.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.631
Ask it?

05:04.429 --> 05:08.475
Lukas would like information
on secret codes and ciphers.

05:10.686 --> 05:11.812
Lucky you.

05:12.980 --> 05:16.191
Several of those are actual books.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.303
Mayor Holland,

05:44.386 --> 05:47.014
there is a Delta event
in the central shaft.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.211
Did you see this?

06:31.850 --> 06:33.060
Is this true?

06:39.691 --> 06:41.026
What was it?

06:41.109 --> 06:43.820
I don't know,
but it smells like gunpowder.

07:16.478 --> 07:20.107
- Why is the power on in IT?
- Tell us the truth!

07:20.190 --> 07:21.900
Tell us the truth!

09:02.084 --> 09:03.252
You want my help?

09:04.461 --> 09:06.630
Nope, I just want my fucking suit back.

09:15.430 --> 09:16.807
The pump you need to restart is eight--

09:16.890 --> 09:18.433
Yeah, it's eight levels underwater.

09:18.517 --> 09:20.102
- Yeah. That-- That's eight--
- I know.

09:21.395 --> 09:22.396
Okay.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.695
Okay.

09:34.741 --> 09:37.953
Look, if you had 300 feet
of waterproof power line lying around

09:38.036 --> 09:39.413
in the vault, that'd be great.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.291
Or how about this?

09:42.374 --> 09:45.002
How about you figure out how
to get me a waterproof cable,

09:45.085 --> 09:47.963
300 feet of tubing
and then something to push air down

09:48.046 --> 09:49.423
so I don't drown.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.843
And meanwhile you give me my suit
and I can go back to my silo.

09:52.926 --> 09:55.137
- No, you know that I can't let you--
- I'll come back.

09:55.220 --> 09:58.515
I promise, when I've saved the people
in my silo, I'll come back.

09:58.599 --> 09:59.933
You've got time. They don't.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.476
Come on.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.061
You've got time.

10:03.145 --> 10:05.814
Just-- Please. I promise.

10:05.898 --> 10:08.442
Yeah, but what if your suit fails
and you die out there?

10:08.525 --> 10:09.860
- No, no.
- What if you get there

10:09.943 --> 10:12.112
and they don't let you in
and you don't have enough air to get back?

10:12.196 --> 10:14.072
- If they see me coming, they're gonna--
- Or what if--

10:14.156 --> 10:15.824
No, what if they let you in
and they kill you?

10:15.908 --> 10:18.452
- They're not gonna kill me. No.
- So they don't kill you,

10:18.535 --> 10:21.205
and then you explain to them
like, "It's dangerous outside,"

10:21.288 --> 10:23.624
and not to make the same mistakes
that we made here

10:23.707 --> 10:25.584
and then they just let you
go back outside.

10:25.667 --> 10:27.211
Okay, okay, okay.

10:27.294 --> 10:31.465
Juliette, I'm sorry. I really am, but--

10:32.466 --> 10:34.426
No. We do this now.

10:46.438 --> 10:49.942
I have the harmonium pedals still.
Would that work?

10:50.776 --> 10:54.404
I don't need your fucking harmonium.
I need a power washer.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.323
Okay?

10:57.407 --> 10:58.408
What?

10:59.034 --> 11:01.870
It's a pump, and if it can send water,
it can send air.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.262
Shit.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.888
You want to tell us
what the hell is going on?

11:19.972 --> 11:22.099
We didn't have a choice, okay?

11:22.182 --> 11:25.018
You didn't have a choice?
Shooting something up the stairs?

11:25.102 --> 11:27.646
We need to get people on our side.
We can't win this fight alone.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.314
You could've gotten someone killed.

11:29.398 --> 11:32.609
It wasn't designed to hurt anyone.
We just needed to send a message.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.736
What was the message?
"We're insane down here"?

11:34.820 --> 11:36.446
No, an actual message.

11:36.530 --> 11:37.531
I read it,

11:37.614 --> 11:39.199
and the only thing
people are gonna care about

11:39.283 --> 11:41.577
is that those assholes
from Greasetown turned the power off.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.829
- And turned it back on.
- That's like some asshole saying,

11:43.912 --> 11:46.623
"Yeah, I hit you, but hey, look,
I stopped." It's not how we make friends.

11:46.707 --> 11:48.584
If either of you have a better idea,
we'd love to hear it.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.461
We are not your allies.
We're the Sheriff's Department.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.548
Then how about you do your job
and find out who poisoned our food?

11:54.631 --> 11:57.301
Or does that seem like
you're being too helpful to us?

12:34.838 --> 12:37.758
I understand you won't speak
to my head of Security?

12:39.551 --> 12:40.719
Look at me.

12:40.802 --> 12:41.970
I'm ancient.

12:42.638 --> 12:45.015
I don't have time for middlemen.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.227
Fair enough.

12:49.978 --> 12:55.150
So, let's not waste any more
of whatever time you have left.

12:57.277 --> 13:01.990
What can you tell me about
the gunpowder in Mechanical?

13:02.533 --> 13:05.369
What happened to the people
I came up top with?

13:06.453 --> 13:07.871
Knox and Shirley.

13:09.164 --> 13:10.165
Walk.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.628
You put my mind at ease about those idiots

13:14.711 --> 13:19.132
and I'll tell you exactly
how much gunpowder

13:19.216 --> 13:21.260
you have to worry about.

13:28.892 --> 13:30.018
No.

13:57.212 --> 13:58.380
There you go.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.595
- You all right, little man?
- He's fine.

14:05.679 --> 14:06.889
Aren't you, big guy?

14:09.766 --> 14:13.437
You know, this wasn't like
the big blackout a few weeks ago.

14:13.520 --> 14:15.814
This was just a teeny, tiny glitch.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.358
That's exactly what I told him.

14:19.568 --> 14:21.195
What's that you have there?

14:29.536 --> 14:33.832
Daddy said
in the before times, people held on to it

14:33.916 --> 14:35.751
when things were scary.

14:37.252 --> 14:38.253
That's right.

14:39.004 --> 14:40.297
And what else?

14:40.964 --> 14:42.466
It kept them safe.

14:44.176 --> 14:45.636
Wow.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.387
Sounds pretty special, huh?

14:50.224 --> 14:51.475
You're not hungry?

14:52.142 --> 14:53.435
It's okay.

14:54.478 --> 14:55.854
Why don't you go to your room?

14:55.938 --> 14:58.690
Dad'll save the rest of the batter
for later, okay?

15:10.118 --> 15:13.330
- You gave him a relic?
- It calmed him down.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.499
- So he's not okay?
- Scared shitless.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.251
Like the rest of the Silo.

15:17.334 --> 15:20.087
People aren't just scared, Rob.
They're impressed.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.339
It was dramatic.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.591
And now they're asking questions.

15:26.260 --> 15:27.469
Where's Bernard?

15:27.553 --> 15:29.012
IT. Why?

15:29.096 --> 15:31.431
Amundsen clearly isn't up to the job,

15:31.515 --> 15:34.518
and Bernard needs to know
we saved those raiders yesterday.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.020
Without us-- Without you,

15:37.104 --> 15:38.939
they could have taken the stairs
to the top,

15:39.022 --> 15:43.026
used that gunpowder on the door
to the outside instead of on some stunt.

15:43.569 --> 15:45.028
Bernard needs my help.

15:46.363 --> 15:49.199
You went to his office yesterday
to try to talk to him.

15:49.283 --> 15:50.450
He knows that.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.494
Has he reached out to you?

15:55.789 --> 15:57.124
No.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.296
What are you thinking?

16:03.380 --> 16:05.007
I'm thinking they have a point.

16:06.049 --> 16:08.385
Their message said look to IT.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.388
The power everywhere else was out
except for IT.

16:11.471 --> 16:15.434
I was there. Bernard came running back in
and then the lights in IT went out.

16:16.101 --> 16:19.229
I think he turned them off because he was
afraid people would see that they were on.

16:19.313 --> 16:21.523
I know you're not defending
the rebels right now.

16:21.607 --> 16:24.693
No, of course not.
But they've put the pressure on Bernard.

16:25.944 --> 16:28.363
All the more reason
for me to go talk to him.

16:28.447 --> 16:30.949
If you go to him,
you're doing him a kindness.

16:31.867 --> 16:35.495
If you wait for him to come to you,
you're doing business.

16:52.971 --> 16:55.307
Got it waterproofed just like you asked.

16:57.643 --> 16:58.894
So--

16:58.977 --> 17:01.605
Okay, so after you plug the power cord
into the pump,

17:01.688 --> 17:04.316
you pull on the escape line
and this little bell is gonna ring.

17:04.816 --> 17:06.484
- Yeah.
- It's gonna t--

17:06.568 --> 17:08.529
It's-- Tell me that it's okay to--

17:08.612 --> 17:11.990
to plug into IT power,
and then you turn on the pump.

17:12.074 --> 17:16.411
Then I'm gonna attach the escape line
to the winch,

17:16.494 --> 17:18.247
and I'm gonna reel you in
just like a fish.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.165
But this is important, okay?

17:22.125 --> 17:26.003
I can't reel you in all at once.
We gotta go slow.

17:27.005 --> 17:30.425
The-- This thing called "the bends." Yeah.

17:30.509 --> 17:34.304
After I read Twenty Thousand Leagues Under
the Sea, I went on this whole ocean kick.

17:34.388 --> 17:37.891
And turns out, if you're deep underwater
and you come up too fast,

17:37.975 --> 17:39.852
all these bubbles start
building up in your joints.

17:39.935 --> 17:42.813
It can make you really sick.
It can even kill you.

17:43.522 --> 17:46.066
- What?
- Yeah, that's why you gotta go slow.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.151
Well, what if I don't come up slow?

17:49.611 --> 17:51.196
Then you're dead.

17:51.822 --> 17:53.657
- What?
- But if you feel bad,

17:53.740 --> 17:57.035
you could go back down under,
but you gotta go at least 20 feet.

17:57.119 --> 17:58.412
And do what?

17:58.495 --> 18:00.497
You would just hang out there

18:00.581 --> 18:03.500
until you don't feel like
you're dying anymore, I guess.

18:05.419 --> 18:08.046
Yeah, sure. I'll do that.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.090
No, I'm not gonna do that. You do that.

18:11.008 --> 18:13.093
- What?
- This is your silo, so you save it.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.469
But you're the engineer!

18:14.553 --> 18:16.263
You seem to know exactly
what needs to be done.

18:16.346 --> 18:17.931
- No, but I can't.
- Why?

18:18.640 --> 18:20.058
Why can't you? Are you scared?

18:20.142 --> 18:23.103
'Cause I'm scared.
So why are you making me do it, huh?

18:23.187 --> 18:25.397
Look, because I'm the head of IT.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.733
Silo 17 is my priority.

18:27.816 --> 18:29.902
You're not head of IT! Stop!

18:29.985 --> 18:31.987
- You're not even Solo!
- I--

18:35.699 --> 18:38.619
Please. Please, I'm the last one left.

18:38.702 --> 18:40.913
I'm a failure.
If I go in the water, I'll--

18:40.996 --> 18:44.124
I'll die. I'm a fuck up, you're not.

18:44.208 --> 18:47.002
You-- Come on. Do it, please.
Will you do it?

18:47.085 --> 18:49.463
You can help save the whole silo.

18:49.546 --> 18:53.342
You can keep me from ruining everything.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.344
Please. Please.

19:00.224 --> 19:01.433
Please.

19:11.902 --> 19:13.111
Fuck.

20:06.415 --> 20:10.169
This morning, the rebels
launched an assault on our Silo.

20:11.003 --> 20:14.840
You all deserve to be commended
for keeping the peace

20:15.382 --> 20:18.802
and doing so without the assistance
of radio communication.

20:21.221 --> 20:24.141
I made the decision
to shut down the radios

20:24.224 --> 20:27.186
during a conversation
with Sheriff Billings last night.

20:27.769 --> 20:31.023
It is my belief that Paul Billings
has been taken hostage

20:31.106 --> 20:33.233
and is being forced
to say the things he said.

20:34.568 --> 20:37.571
No doubt, this will be
cleared up when the rebellion is over

20:37.654 --> 20:40.532
and Sheriff Billings returns
to the Up Top, where he belongs.

20:41.533 --> 20:46.538
Till then, all radio communication
throughout the Silo remains disabled.

20:47.164 --> 20:48.373
What does this mean?

20:51.376 --> 20:53.462
"IT lies to us"?

20:54.463 --> 20:56.715
I heard that power stayed on in IT

20:56.798 --> 20:58.717
while the rest of the Silo
was in the dark.

21:01.053 --> 21:03.722
Mechanical controls where the power goes.

21:03.805 --> 21:08.352
They left IT powered up for a few minutes
to cast doubt on my department and on me.

21:10.020 --> 21:12.606
Make no mistake, we are under attack.

21:13.148 --> 21:16.276
Because of this,
all things rebellion-related

21:16.360 --> 21:18.028
will be handled by Judicial.

21:18.111 --> 21:21.573
Your job, as always,
is to keep the peace on your levels.

21:21.657 --> 21:23.867
Judicial will take care
of everything else.

21:25.369 --> 21:26.662
That is all for now.

21:27.246 --> 21:29.122
Thank you for your service.

21:34.962 --> 21:36.797
I don't know why you
guys brought me in here.

21:36.880 --> 21:37.881
Sure you do.

21:41.093 --> 21:43.011
A little bite? Refresh your memory.

21:43.095 --> 21:45.138
I had nothing to do
with poisoning the food.

21:45.222 --> 21:46.932
There we go.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.684
See, I told you that you knew.

21:49.726 --> 21:52.479
Now, here's the thing, Martin.

21:53.146 --> 21:56.608
If you didn't poison the food supply,
who did?

21:58.569 --> 21:59.653
I--

22:00.237 --> 22:01.989
I don't know who the other listeners are.

22:03.907 --> 22:05.909
- I swear. I--
- He swears, Hank.

22:06.410 --> 22:07.578
Yeah, I believe him.

22:08.662 --> 22:09.955
Do you?

22:10.038 --> 22:11.373
Leaning towards yes.

22:12.124 --> 22:15.586
But I also think Martin here may be able
to tell us a little bit more.

22:16.170 --> 22:19.423
And if he helps us, maybe we won't
tell everyone he's been ratting them out

22:19.506 --> 22:21.008
to Judicial this whole time.

22:22.134 --> 22:23.969
What do you think about that, Martin?

22:26.138 --> 22:29.141
There's a place where someone leaves notes
for us in the scavenge room.

22:29.892 --> 22:32.186
One of the collection bins
has a hollow handle,

22:32.269 --> 22:33.854
and I don't know
who leaves the notes either.

22:33.937 --> 22:36.607
Are we getting
to the helpful part soon or--

22:40.068 --> 22:41.862
There was a note in there today.

22:43.447 --> 22:44.448
An order.

22:45.073 --> 22:46.325
What kind of order?

22:51.330 --> 22:54.416
I think we need to consider what we'll do
if we are in this alone.

22:54.499 --> 22:56.168
We need a backup plan.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.505
Are you gonna tell me why you kissed me?

23:01.256 --> 23:03.133
I didn't kiss you. You kissed me.

23:05.135 --> 23:08.972
And my point is, we need to be prepared.
Something big--

23:09.890 --> 23:11.350
Why are you looking at me like that?

23:11.433 --> 23:13.268
Sorry to interrupt.

23:13.352 --> 23:15.062
What is it?

23:15.145 --> 23:17.648
We need to take you and Knox into custody.

23:17.731 --> 23:19.066
Are we doing this again?

23:19.566 --> 23:20.943
- I thought we--
- We're not here to arrest you.

23:21.026 --> 23:23.612
We just talked to a listener.
There is a plot to--

23:26.323 --> 23:27.783
Well, to kill you.

23:30.369 --> 23:32.746
Make sure we don't have any problems
with the deputies.

23:32.829 --> 23:33.830
I will, sir.

23:33.914 --> 23:35.582
Did you get anywhere with McLain?

23:35.666 --> 23:37.459
Nowhere, but even if she did talk,

23:37.543 --> 23:39.920
we wouldn't be able to rely
on the information.

23:40.003 --> 23:42.589
Where are we on the warrant
to search Supply?

23:42.673 --> 23:45.217
Do we need one? The Pact would say
that this falls under emergency powers--

23:45.300 --> 23:47.803
Of course I don't need one, but I want one

23:47.886 --> 23:49.930
to maintain at least
the appearance of order.

23:50.013 --> 23:53.141
So, again, do you have the warrant?

23:54.059 --> 23:56.520
Judge Sims has not signed off on it.

23:56.603 --> 23:57.729
Why not?

23:58.689 --> 23:59.982
He sent word.

24:00.065 --> 24:02.526
He wants to speak to you first
in his chambers.

24:15.372 --> 24:16.748
You finish the boots?

24:16.832 --> 24:18.417
- Yep.
- Okay.

24:18.500 --> 24:20.752
I put weights in 'em just like you asked.

24:21.420 --> 24:24.256
So that-- You know,
that should keep you on your feet.

24:31.180 --> 24:32.806
In the before times,

24:33.307 --> 24:36.101
they used to do
this thing called swimming,

24:36.185 --> 24:39.229
where they would pull with their arms
and kick with their legs

24:39.313 --> 24:41.481
to move through the water
just like a fish.

24:42.733 --> 24:43.859
Except--

24:43.942 --> 24:47.613
Except fish don't have arms or legs, but--

24:50.490 --> 24:54.077
They also figured out a way
of seeing underwater.

24:54.161 --> 24:58.123
They figured if they looked through glass
that it wouldn't be blurry.

24:58.207 --> 24:59.249
So…

25:01.710 --> 25:03.337
I made you these.

25:04.254 --> 25:05.255
Surprise.

25:11.929 --> 25:14.973
I made 'em out of welders' goggles.

25:17.142 --> 25:19.228
Great. Thanks.

25:22.231 --> 25:23.649
Okay. Can you pull that through?

25:36.245 --> 25:38.455
How long are you gonna stay mad at me?

25:39.206 --> 25:41.208
If the people in my silo die…

25:44.169 --> 25:46.338
Just check the lines and make sure
the power washer's running.

26:29.339 --> 26:31.008
You don't understand how this works,
do you?

26:31.091 --> 26:33.218
I'm sorry. He just barged in.
I couldn't make him stop.

26:33.302 --> 26:34.636
It's all right, Sharon. You can go.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.889
I assigned you this position--
this promotion--

26:36.972 --> 26:38.724
because I never wanted
to see your face again.

26:38.807 --> 26:40.726
There are no more conversations
between us.

26:40.809 --> 26:41.810
No discussions.

26:41.894 --> 26:43.520
You sign what I tell you to sign.

26:43.604 --> 26:46.023
You sit behind that desk,
you pretend to have power,

26:46.106 --> 26:47.399
and then you go home.

26:47.482 --> 26:49.359
That's it. That's the rest of your life.

26:49.443 --> 26:52.905
Now get out your rubber stamp
and give me my fucking search warrant.

27:03.790 --> 27:04.875
No.

27:04.958 --> 27:05.959
No?

27:06.043 --> 27:08.253
I gave you a decade of my life,

27:09.755 --> 27:12.674
my loyalty, my faith.

27:13.842 --> 27:18.847
The problems I've solved for you,
you don't think I paid a price for that?

27:19.348 --> 27:20.474
And why?

27:20.557 --> 27:21.934
Because I trusted you.

27:22.559 --> 27:25.521
I thought we had an understanding
you'd make me your shadow.

27:25.604 --> 27:27.314
I did want you to be my shadow, Robert.

27:28.023 --> 27:30.150
And then I never really
got around to it, did I?

27:30.943 --> 27:33.862
Deep down, I must've had reservations.

27:33.946 --> 27:36.532
And then, finally, I realized what it was.

27:37.115 --> 27:40.536
You're very good at solving problems,
but you lack curiosity.

27:40.619 --> 27:42.871
And that's something
the head of IT must have,

27:42.955 --> 27:45.415
and therefore, something
that his shadow must have.

27:45.499 --> 27:49.253
It's something my old shadow had
and something my new shadow has.

27:50.796 --> 27:54.132
You made Lukas Kyle your shadow?

27:56.426 --> 27:59.596
Glad you have such a strong team
at your side.

27:59.680 --> 28:04.643
Lukas Kyle, Amundsen,
but the list ends there.

28:05.394 --> 28:06.603
You lost the sheriff.

28:06.687 --> 28:09.523
Every deputy on duty
heard Billings undermine you.

28:09.606 --> 28:13.610
How long till you lose
the entire department and Judicial?

28:14.736 --> 28:17.865
Graffiti on the stairs,
in the Up Top no less,

28:17.948 --> 28:20.200
and you didn't pay someone to paint it.

28:22.452 --> 28:24.830
That's not part of the plan,
is it, Bernie?

28:25.414 --> 28:28.041
And we both know that Amundsen is useless.

28:28.125 --> 28:30.169
You had no idea about the gunpowder,
did you?

28:30.252 --> 28:32.337
Because he doesn't know what to look for.

28:32.963 --> 28:35.716
The only reason he was able
to save those raiders yesterday

28:35.799 --> 28:38.051
was because of me and Camille.

28:38.969 --> 28:43.891
Now, you gotta be wondering,
"What else am I missing?"

28:44.516 --> 28:45.726
I'll tell you.

28:46.685 --> 28:51.190
You're running out of allies,
and you're running out of moves.

28:53.358 --> 28:55.068
What are you missing, Rob?

28:56.403 --> 28:59.406
After you put me in a position
where I had no choice

28:59.489 --> 29:02.951
but to take the life of a woman
I had some affection for,

29:03.035 --> 29:06.955
we both agreed that the two people coming
to meet her from Mechanical

29:07.039 --> 29:10.125
would be blamed for her death,
and then they got away.

29:10.792 --> 29:14.338
Now, your wife may have helped
save those raiders yesterday,

29:14.421 --> 29:19.176
but she's also the reason those fugitives
made it safely back to the Down Deep.

29:19.259 --> 29:22.262
But you knew that already, didn't you,

29:23.263 --> 29:26.058
considering how close the two of you are?

29:39.488 --> 29:40.697
What do you want?

29:41.281 --> 29:43.742
We've got a rat problem
down here, Frances,

29:43.825 --> 29:47.162
and I was hoping you'd be able to help me
a little bit more than Marty Glynn.

29:48.288 --> 29:49.122
Why's that?

29:49.206 --> 29:52.000
Come on, Frances.
We both know the kind of company you keep.

29:53.210 --> 29:55.420
Somebody tried to poison the food supply,

29:55.504 --> 29:57.005
it's only gonna get worse.

29:57.089 --> 29:59.758
- This is serious.
- It's serious?

30:01.093 --> 30:02.094
You hear that?

30:02.177 --> 30:03.804
He said it's serious.

30:03.887 --> 30:05.180
Well, it sounds serious.

30:05.681 --> 30:06.515
Sorry.

30:07.724 --> 30:10.352
Seriously, Hank.
If you think I know any rats,

30:10.435 --> 30:12.104
- you can fuck off.
- Come on--

32:01.588 --> 32:02.589
No.

32:03.549 --> 32:05.551
Told you Frances was a waste of time.

32:05.634 --> 32:09.346
Yeah. Well, you were right.

32:16.061 --> 32:17.354
What are you looking for?

32:17.437 --> 32:19.648
We know the listeners get notes
in the scavenge room,

32:20.732 --> 32:23.110
so we need a list of people
who have access.

32:23.652 --> 32:26.154
- Next drawer down.
- What did you file it under?

32:26.238 --> 32:28.490
They're sending messages
to have us killed.

32:29.324 --> 32:30.868
Let's send a message back.

32:31.618 --> 32:32.619
Like what?

32:33.245 --> 32:36.081
We already used gunpowder
to shoot something up the shaft.

32:36.164 --> 32:38.458
If we had enough of it, we could send you.

32:39.710 --> 32:42.421
You ever think that
maybe they want you dead

32:42.504 --> 32:44.256
because you're such a pain in the ass?

32:47.968 --> 32:49.803
You two look like you're having fun.

32:51.889 --> 32:53.473
What can we do for you, Walk?

32:54.349 --> 32:56.226
You can tell me about Judicial seclusion.

32:56.310 --> 32:58.854
- You worked there.
- I worked in Judicial, yes.

32:58.937 --> 33:01.481
Walk, come on, this isn't gonna help.

33:01.565 --> 33:02.858
Can you please--

33:02.941 --> 33:04.359
And?

33:04.443 --> 33:07.446
Very few people in Judicial
even know about it,

33:07.529 --> 33:09.656
let alone have access to it.

33:10.991 --> 33:14.912
I know people who went into seclusion
usually didn't come out.

33:16.246 --> 33:17.497
And I know that Shirley's right.

33:17.581 --> 33:20.375
This line of questioning
won't lead you anywhere good.

33:20.459 --> 33:22.544
McLain is in a fortress.

33:23.462 --> 33:24.630
There's no way.

33:25.547 --> 33:28.175
Could I at least get a message to her?

33:28.258 --> 33:30.719
They're not allowing porters
anywhere near the barricades.

33:30.802 --> 33:33.138
You could radio one of your friends.

33:33.222 --> 33:34.765
Come on, you could call in a favor.

33:34.848 --> 33:36.725
You heard anything
on your radio today, Walk?

33:37.643 --> 33:38.560
No. Why?

33:38.644 --> 33:40.521
The mayor shut it down
because he didn't like

33:40.604 --> 33:42.272
what the sheriff here was saying.

33:43.774 --> 33:45.526
Send a computer message.

33:45.609 --> 33:46.985
Shut that down too.

33:51.073 --> 33:55.702
Twenty-five years ago, I didn't do enough.
That's how I lost her in the first place.

33:56.370 --> 33:58.956
I'll be damned
if I don't do enough this time.

33:59.039 --> 34:00.374
- Walk.
- No.

34:01.959 --> 34:04.545
Is there anyone
on the other side of the barrier

34:04.628 --> 34:06.922
that you can trust enough
to get a note to?

34:07.005 --> 34:08.590
About Judicial seclusion?

34:10.259 --> 34:11.467
No.

34:14.804 --> 34:17.516
Show me atbash again.

34:19.893 --> 34:21.061
Right. You just--

34:22.020 --> 34:23.647
No, it doesn't make any sense.

34:24.313 --> 34:25.690
Go back to the original.

34:35.534 --> 34:36.909
What if they aren't letters?

34:38.745 --> 34:42.498
Show me everything about numeric ciphers.

36:12.798 --> 36:15.425
You recognize any of these names
from your Judicial days?

36:15.968 --> 36:17.052
Not yet.

36:17.886 --> 36:20.180
I always thought Lorelei was a listener.

36:20.264 --> 36:22.808
Lorelei's an asshole, not a listener.

36:23.475 --> 36:26.979
We can't be guaranteed it's the only place
where listeners get their orders.

36:28.105 --> 36:29.189
Kat?

36:30.399 --> 36:31.608
You've got a problem.

36:31.692 --> 36:32.693
What?

36:32.776 --> 36:35.028
After you left, Frances said
she had to go somewhere.

36:35.112 --> 36:37.239
I was pretty sure she was lying,
so I followed her.

36:37.322 --> 36:39.283
- You followed her?
- To the cafeteria.

36:39.366 --> 36:41.285
- Things are getting out of hand.
- Sheriff.

36:42.077 --> 36:45.038
No offense to either one of you,
but if it's already out of hand,

36:45.122 --> 36:47.332
you're gonna need someone
they might actually listen to.

37:58.362 --> 37:59.321
Get away from me!

37:59.404 --> 38:00.405
Stick together!

38:01.240 --> 38:02.741
Move! Hey! Calm down!

38:04.034 --> 38:05.994
- Get back!
- She tried to kill us.

38:06.078 --> 38:06.995
She poisoned our food.

38:07.079 --> 38:08.914
No, I didn't, I swear! Ask them!

38:08.997 --> 38:10.707
I showed them the poisoned food. I didn't.

38:10.791 --> 38:12.835
- You are a filthy liar!
- I am not lying!

38:12.918 --> 38:14.461
- Stay back!
- It's true.

38:14.545 --> 38:16.922
Maeve told us the food was poisoned.

38:17.714 --> 38:19.758
You see? You crazy bitch.

38:19.842 --> 38:21.718
Okay! All right! Stay back!

38:22.427 --> 38:24.847
All right! All right! Back!

38:24.930 --> 38:26.890
It was nice of you
to make sure nobody got hurt.

38:28.308 --> 38:29.309
What?

38:31.395 --> 38:32.396
Hey.

38:34.857 --> 38:37.276
How's your mom these days, Maeve?

38:39.319 --> 38:40.571
The meds--

38:41.280 --> 38:43.782
They were pretty scarce before,
but since the blockade,

38:45.284 --> 38:46.869
I can't imagine things have been easy.

38:56.545 --> 38:57.629
She's in Medical.

38:59.256 --> 39:00.716
Above the blockade.

39:05.304 --> 39:06.638
I had to.

39:07.681 --> 39:09.683
If I didn't do what they said--

39:09.766 --> 39:11.476
You were afraid
they'd do something to her.

39:13.562 --> 39:15.230
I didn't have a choice.

39:17.274 --> 39:19.234
But I made sure that nobody got hurt.

39:19.318 --> 39:21.403
What about the kill order
on Knox and Shirley?

39:21.904 --> 39:23.572
They told me to plant that note.

39:24.281 --> 39:25.866
They said that it would upset people.

39:26.742 --> 39:28.076
Turn them against each other.

39:28.660 --> 39:30.245
Well, I guess it worked.

39:31.538 --> 39:32.623
Please.

39:33.999 --> 39:35.000
Don't kill me.

39:36.043 --> 39:37.127
I'm one of you.

39:38.962 --> 39:40.589
That still means something.

39:47.513 --> 39:48.931
We're not gonna kill you.

39:50.349 --> 39:52.976
We're not gonna send you to the mines
like they do up top.

39:54.520 --> 39:58.398
We're gonna give you some tough jobs,
right here in your home.

39:59.775 --> 40:01.902
We're gonna give you shit
for a little while.

40:03.153 --> 40:04.863
Remind you of who you are.

40:06.657 --> 40:08.575
We're gonna make sure your mom is okay.

40:10.786 --> 40:13.455
And you'll never turn your back
on Mechanical again, will you?

40:15.207 --> 40:17.751
No, never.

40:26.009 --> 40:27.761
It's a book cipher.

40:27.845 --> 40:31.890
Okay, the letters weren't letters,
they were numbers.

40:31.974 --> 40:36.144
So, each one corresponds
to the appearance of a word

40:36.228 --> 40:39.273
on a specific page of a specific book.

40:40.107 --> 40:43.277
And I think the page is number 77

40:43.360 --> 40:45.487
because seven is the only number
that Quinn used

40:45.571 --> 40:50.617
in the portion of his message that
wasn't in code and he used it twice.

40:53.787 --> 40:56.582
Did you test your theory
against the books in the Legacy?

40:57.875 --> 41:00.627
Yes, there weren't any matches
in the Legacy.

41:00.711 --> 41:02.379
- Then you're wrong.
- I'm not wrong.

41:03.046 --> 41:07.509
All it means is that Quinn didn't use
a book from the Legacy to create his code,

41:08.719 --> 41:13.265
which makes sense
because he wanted his code to be solved.

41:13.932 --> 41:18.979
Only two people have access to that vault,
to those books.

41:20.689 --> 41:23.650
So, he used a relic.

41:25.068 --> 41:28.238
A book that is out in the Silo.

41:28.322 --> 41:29.865
Exactly.

41:29.948 --> 41:34.745
We need a book that's over 140 years old.

41:35.287 --> 41:37.539
Maybe even something
that belonged to Quinn himself.

41:39.625 --> 41:44.630
Do you know anyone in the Silo
that might have such a relic?

41:48.217 --> 41:49.384
One person.

41:51.512 --> 41:52.930
Knew.

41:56.391 --> 42:00.395
And I have the book
that you can start with.

42:30.384 --> 42:33.053
You're gonna strain your eyes
sitting in the dark like this.

42:41.186 --> 42:42.896
You spoke to Bernard.

42:44.690 --> 42:47.234
He told you about the two Mechanicals
I helped get away.

42:49.820 --> 42:51.947
You had just been sworn in as Judge.

42:52.030 --> 42:55.409
You were still trying to win Bernard
back over, which was smart.

42:55.909 --> 42:57.703
But making friends?

42:57.786 --> 42:58.996
That's smart too.

43:02.374 --> 43:06.503
- So you went behind my back?
- No. I was trying to protect you.

43:07.462 --> 43:10.132
I knew that Bernard would find out
one way or another.

43:11.592 --> 43:14.803
He needed to think I was taking matters
into my own hands.

43:14.887 --> 43:17.472
Bernard couldn't think you had anything
to do with the two escaping,

43:17.556 --> 43:18.640
and he still doesn't.

43:18.724 --> 43:20.976
You want to make friends
with the rebels, Camille?

43:22.019 --> 43:23.604
You know how dangerous they are?

43:23.687 --> 43:24.980
And Bernard isn't?

43:31.778 --> 43:34.406
We don't know how this is going to end.

43:35.199 --> 43:37.993
So until we do, we play both sides.

43:38.702 --> 43:39.953
Yeah.

43:40.746 --> 43:42.748
But we don't play each other.

43:43.415 --> 43:45.459
What you tried to do at breakfast,

43:46.460 --> 43:49.671
tried to keep me from talking
to Bernard, from finding out--

43:54.635 --> 43:58.722
We make moves together or not at all.

44:00.307 --> 44:01.558
No more secrets.

44:08.190 --> 44:09.691
No more secrets.

45:46.246 --> 45:48.582
No way to get a message up top?

45:50.209 --> 45:51.668
No way.

48:29.326 --> 48:32.871
Sir, the camera in Martha Walker's
workshop just went live for 30 seconds.

48:33.455 --> 48:35.207
We're trying to get it back online.

48:35.290 --> 48:37.668
How was it reactivated in the first place?

48:37.751 --> 48:39.837
We believe she turned it on.

48:40.754 --> 48:42.339
Why would she do that?

48:42.422 --> 48:44.132
I used the cameras
to track McLain the last few days,

48:44.216 --> 48:46.760
to see if we could figure out
how she moved the gunpowder.

48:46.844 --> 48:49.429
No luck there, but then I saw this.

48:51.515 --> 48:54.351
This is from when you had
the Mechanical deputy take her

48:54.434 --> 48:57.646
and McLain into custody while
you gave your speech to the Silo.

49:01.942 --> 49:03.318
I checked their records.

49:04.111 --> 49:05.946
They divorced 25 years ago.

49:07.447 --> 49:09.700
But they still mean something
to each other.

49:13.287 --> 49:14.913
This is very good work, Mr. Amundsen.

49:19.793 --> 49:20.919
Solo?
