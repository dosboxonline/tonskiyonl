01:01.833 --> 01:04.291
Look who's awake.

01:04.291 --> 01:05.500
How'd you sleep?

01:07.250 --> 01:08.833
Better than ever.

01:08.833 --> 01:10.958
Delivery from Shep and Lyana.

01:11.666 --> 01:12.875
Another one?

01:12.875 --> 01:14.500
They're happy you're back.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.666
And so are we.

01:21.083 --> 01:22.666
Where's Crosshair?

01:22.666 --> 01:25.458
He wasn't in the ship when we woke up.

01:25.458 --> 01:27.791
He's still adjusting.

01:28.625 --> 01:29.708
I'll check on him.

01:53.625 --> 01:57.000
Greetings, Omega!

02:15.708 --> 02:17.708
Shep and Lyana found you then?

02:18.416 --> 02:21.250
Their ability to do so is uncanny.

02:21.750 --> 02:26.125
I know what you're doing, Crosshair,
but you can't keep hiding.

02:26.125 --> 02:27.541
You need to talk to Hunter.

02:27.541 --> 02:31.000
I'm not hiding. I'm training.

02:35.500 --> 02:39.750
You know, I'm sure AZI
could look at your hand for you.

02:39.750 --> 02:42.333
I'm fine.

02:44.291 --> 02:47.708
So what skills does this require,
besides good sight?

02:47.708 --> 02:51.208
Being a sniper is more than
just looking through a scope.

02:51.875 --> 02:55.708
It's about patience.
Reading the environment.

02:57.583 --> 03:00.291
And knowing when you've got eyes on you.

03:04.666 --> 03:06.750
They don't trust me.

03:06.750 --> 03:10.750
Give it time.
But you will have to talk to them.

03:11.666 --> 03:12.666
Hmm.

03:17.083 --> 03:20.375
Not sure it was a good idea
to give Crosshair back his rifle.

03:20.958 --> 03:24.333
Omega trusts him.
That's good enough for me.

03:30.958 --> 03:32.291
It's Echo!

03:33.083 --> 03:34.375
Perfect.

03:34.375 --> 03:36.750
I have tabulated your shooting accuracy.

03:36.750 --> 03:40.000
Your target success rate today was at 53%.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.875
Well below your average.

03:56.375 --> 03:59.666
Glad to see you're back safe.

04:00.625 --> 04:03.458
What? No hug for me?

04:03.458 --> 04:07.083
That depends
how good your intel is.

04:18.041 --> 04:22.041
They were using clones
for testing, taking samples.

04:22.041 --> 04:25.625
Most were held in the detention wing,
but I never saw what was in the vault.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.833
Even Emerie wasn't allowed access.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.041
Emerie?

04:29.041 --> 04:31.250
She works for Hemlock.

04:31.250 --> 04:34.916
She's a clone, like us. Like me.

04:35.875 --> 04:39.375
And what about you? Anything else to add?

04:40.000 --> 04:43.791
I was a prisoner. Not much to tell.

04:44.416 --> 04:46.916
We've been searching for this base
for a long time.

04:47.583 --> 04:49.333
Accurate intel's hard to come by.

04:49.958 --> 04:53.041
We need to know all we can
before making any moves.

04:53.041 --> 04:56.875
We have Nala Se's datapad,
but it isn't working anymore.

04:56.875 --> 05:00.666
If we can get it online, we should be able
to pull more intel on Tantiss.

05:00.666 --> 05:03.250
It could have schematics, entry points.

05:03.875 --> 05:06.375
Maybe even the coordinates
of the base itself.

05:06.375 --> 05:09.291
Imperial encryption will be a problem,

05:10.166 --> 05:12.666
especially without Tech.

05:16.333 --> 05:20.083
Plugging it into an Imperial terminal
will bypass the encryption.

05:20.083 --> 05:22.500
Where do we get one of those?

05:22.500 --> 05:25.583
I know a facility.

05:25.583 --> 05:28.000
Remote, understaffed.

05:28.791 --> 05:31.625
It shouldn't be a problem to infiltrate.

05:36.291 --> 05:40.291
Crosshair, Echo, and I
will go to this remote facility.

05:40.291 --> 05:42.541
Wrecker and Omega, you stay here.

05:43.666 --> 05:46.250
We're finally together
and you want to split us up?

05:46.250 --> 05:48.166
We just got you back.

05:48.166 --> 05:51.291
I am not going to risk
you getting captured again.

05:51.875 --> 05:55.458
Yeah, we escaped,
but I left all those clones behind.

05:56.708 --> 05:58.125
I need to do this, Hunter.

06:23.291 --> 06:25.375
Don't hold it against him.

06:26.083 --> 06:27.833
He's only worried about you.

06:28.375 --> 06:29.291
I know.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.041
You think I should stay behind too?

06:32.041 --> 06:35.541
You're capable, but you are still a kid.

06:35.541 --> 06:39.625
I'm older than you are,
little brother.

06:41.833 --> 06:45.916
I don't know if this'll fit still,
but, uh, here.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.458
My old armor.

06:50.458 --> 06:53.708
Yeah, it never felt right
to get rid of it.

07:16.916 --> 07:18.000
On approach.

07:18.000 --> 07:22.041
Reading minimal life signs, if any.

07:37.500 --> 07:42.000
No heat signatures inside of the depots,
and nothing on comms.

07:42.791 --> 07:44.000
There's no one here.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.916
Hey, it does fit.

08:15.625 --> 08:20.500
You said this outpost was remote,
not abandoned entirely.

08:20.500 --> 08:24.500
Well, I didn't get
daily intel briefings in my cell.

08:25.041 --> 08:28.375
I get the feeling there's more
to this place than you're saying.

08:35.625 --> 08:37.250
Batcher, what is it?

08:37.250 --> 08:38.958
Uh, what's going on?

08:44.750 --> 08:47.333
The sensors are giving off
a high-frequency tone.

08:47.333 --> 08:49.000
She must be reacting to it.

08:49.958 --> 08:51.666
What are the sensors for?

08:51.666 --> 08:54.833
Perimeter detection against local raiders.

08:54.833 --> 08:58.166
You didn't think to warn us
about these raiders before?

08:58.916 --> 09:01.750
No, they were all dealt with.

09:01.750 --> 09:03.625
And how do you know that?

09:03.625 --> 09:05.500
Take a guess.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.375
Just following orders?

09:08.375 --> 09:12.333
If you're scared,
why don't you wait on the ship?

09:12.333 --> 09:16.375
Hey, kill each other later.
We're here for a reason.

09:17.125 --> 09:19.458
Let's crack into the datapad
and get out of here.

09:23.500 --> 09:27.458
I said talk to him, not argue with him.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.916
He started it.

10:48.208 --> 10:52.375
The power to this outpost has been
nearly depleted by the sensor beacons.

10:52.375 --> 10:55.500
Then we need to divert
all power to this depot.

10:55.500 --> 10:56.583
On it.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.625
So why'd the Empire abandon this place?

11:04.625 --> 11:07.125
I guess it served its purpose.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.291
Hmm. Sounds familiar.

12:27.458 --> 12:28.625
That should do it.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.500
Ah, it's working.

12:40.541 --> 12:42.041
Look at this manifest.

12:42.666 --> 12:46.083
There are even more clone prisoners
on Tantiss than we thought.

13:05.250 --> 13:06.250
Where are you going?

13:07.250 --> 13:08.833
To check the perimeter.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.208
Uh, let them work it out.

13:17.041 --> 13:19.208
We have to finish this data transfer.

13:43.333 --> 13:46.500
Are you going to be my shadow everywhere?

13:46.500 --> 13:48.208
I know you.

13:48.208 --> 13:52.291
There's more you're not telling us,
and I'm done waiting.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.791
Start talking, Crosshair.

13:55.750 --> 13:59.666
What did you do to finally get on
the Empire's bad side?

13:59.666 --> 14:02.083
Betray them, like you did with us?

14:11.208 --> 14:12.791
Any schematics on there?

14:12.791 --> 14:16.416
None that I'm seeing.
Just medical records.

14:16.416 --> 14:18.166
I think this is all we're gonna get.

14:18.166 --> 14:20.291
At least it's something.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.916
Batcher?

14:26.791 --> 14:28.791
Something's wrong.

14:28.791 --> 14:32.791
You thought we'd take you back
and not ask questions?

14:32.791 --> 14:33.958
I don't think so.

14:34.541 --> 14:35.875
Tell me what changed.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.291
What happened, Crosshair?

14:44.958 --> 14:48.125
I killed an Imperial officer.

14:49.708 --> 14:56.125
So, yes, I did betray them
after they betrayed me.

14:56.958 --> 15:00.208
Oh, don't pretend
like this is all about me.

15:00.208 --> 15:02.291
I tried to warn you, Hunter.

15:03.333 --> 15:05.833
I risked everything
to send you that message.

15:06.416 --> 15:07.916
You ignored it.

15:07.916 --> 15:10.750
You let Omega be taken to Tantiss.

15:11.791 --> 15:16.125
She went through what she did
because you failed.

15:16.125 --> 15:21.208
You're angry because she escaped
with my help, not yours.

15:28.541 --> 15:29.791
Move!

15:45.875 --> 15:46.791
Hurry!

15:57.125 --> 16:00.208
I guess we know what the perimeter sensors
are meant to keep out.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.166
Great. What now?

16:06.916 --> 16:09.750
No chance of digging out the ship
with that thing out there.

16:09.750 --> 16:12.250
We have to restore power
to the sensor beacons.

16:16.333 --> 16:20.000
There's a fuse box for the reserve
energy grid in the back of this compound.

16:20.666 --> 16:23.750
One of us needs to get over there
and reset the grid manually.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.166
I'll do it.

16:25.166 --> 16:27.500
And I can get the defense system
reactivated once power's back.

16:27.500 --> 16:30.750
We'll have to draw the creature
beyond the sensors before they reboot,

16:30.750 --> 16:33.208
or we'll be trapped inside the perimeter
with that thing.

16:33.208 --> 16:34.541
I'll handle it.

16:34.541 --> 16:36.833
Not alone. We'll do it together.

16:37.416 --> 16:39.166
You sure about that?

16:41.416 --> 16:43.000
I'll spot you both from the tower.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.250
Then let's get to it
before it tears this place apart.

17:20.750 --> 17:22.000
Three o'clock!

17:33.625 --> 17:34.666
Hunter!

17:39.916 --> 17:41.250
Why?

17:41.250 --> 17:43.916
Why is there always a huge monster?

17:45.625 --> 17:47.125
<i>Echo, do you see it?</i>

17:47.625 --> 17:49.375
I don't have a visual.

17:59.083 --> 18:02.208
Can you get outside
the perimeter from down there?

18:02.208 --> 18:04.416
I'll follow the tunnel north. Find out.

18:04.416 --> 18:06.250
We'll track you from up here.

18:12.958 --> 18:15.000
Huh?

18:23.666 --> 18:25.458
Target spotted.
It's right on your tail.

18:25.458 --> 18:27.916
- About a hundred meters and closing.
- Got it.

18:48.625 --> 18:51.125
I think I just made it angrier.

18:51.125 --> 18:53.500
Fantastic.

19:01.791 --> 19:03.583
Okay, I found the fuse box.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.666
Good. Now prime the breaker.

19:19.916 --> 19:21.666
You're about 400 meters
from the perimeter.

19:23.666 --> 19:25.125
No sign of that thing.

19:45.208 --> 19:48.041
We found a weak point in the ice.
We'll try to dig through.

19:48.666 --> 19:49.833
<i>You'll try?</i>

19:49.833 --> 19:52.333
Glad you heard me properly.

20:01.041 --> 20:03.666
All right. Breaker's primed.
What next, kid?

20:03.666 --> 20:06.708
<i>Cycle the navigator. That should
be to the right of the main breaker.</i>

20:11.750 --> 20:15.166
Things are getting close in here.
Am I gonna have a way out or not?

20:15.166 --> 20:17.208
<i>If you end up where we hope you do.</i>

20:18.416 --> 20:20.083
Boom! Power's online.

20:20.083 --> 20:21.916
Hunter, should I activate the beacon?

20:21.916 --> 20:24.750
Wait! We have to make sure
the wyrm is past the perimeter.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.041
Get up here!

20:42.041 --> 20:44.875
Not yet.
Where's the wyrm? I can't find it.

20:56.416 --> 20:58.416
It's past the perimeter!

20:58.416 --> 21:00.708
Omega, activate the sensors!

21:00.708 --> 21:02.166
Bringing them online now.

22:35.333 --> 22:37.916
See? They always work it out.

22:38.583 --> 22:42.583
And I don't even see any blood this time.
That's progress.

22:44.958 --> 22:47.708
Do you think the intel we recovered
will help you and Rex?

22:47.708 --> 22:50.958
We still don't know
the coordinates of Tantiss.

22:50.958 --> 22:54.625
But between the datapad
and all you and Crosshair have told me,

22:54.625 --> 22:57.958
we're closer to finding
and freeing those clones.

22:57.958 --> 23:00.458
I wish I could've done more to help them.

23:00.458 --> 23:02.375
You did all you could, kid.

23:03.083 --> 23:05.750
And you did exactly
what you're supposed to do.

23:06.416 --> 23:08.500
You got out of there.

23:36.750 --> 23:37.750
Hunter?

23:39.958 --> 23:40.958
I...

23:41.791 --> 23:46.708
I thought I knew what I was
getting into with the Empire.

23:47.958 --> 23:51.958
I thought I was being a good soldier.

23:55.291 --> 23:59.458
Nobody really understood
what was happening back then.

24:00.416 --> 24:03.000
I've done things.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.750
I've made mistakes.

24:07.333 --> 24:09.416
I have regrets too, Crosshair.

24:10.958 --> 24:16.041
All we can do is keep trying to be better.

24:16.666 --> 24:21.416
And who knows?
There just might be hope for us yet.
