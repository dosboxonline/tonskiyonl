â™ª

00:27.070 --> 00:29.855
Previously on
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:29.899 --> 00:31.509
These experiences I've had,

00:31.553 --> 00:32.858
and now we're on this quest

00:32.902 --> 00:35.426
to find the thing
that created us.

00:35.470 --> 00:37.428
-But Paul...
-Hates the unknown.

00:37.472 --> 00:40.257
And we've always been able
to find answers together.

00:40.301 --> 00:41.998
I don't know how
to talk to him about this.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.434
RAYNER:
It's a time bug.
They're designed

00:43.478 --> 00:44.870
to paralyze an enemy ship

00:44.914 --> 00:46.959
by randomly cycling them
through time.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.700
The whole point
is to keep us stuck.

00:48.744 --> 00:51.573
Adira, the time bug
wasn't your fault.

00:51.616 --> 00:53.096
Well, I brought it
on board, didn't I?

00:53.140 --> 00:55.446
Two signatures on the bridge,
that's you and me.

00:55.490 --> 00:58.449
Three from sickbay. That's
Moll and L'ak and the clue.

00:58.493 --> 00:59.450
They found it.

00:59.494 --> 01:02.584
[weapons firing]

01:09.460 --> 01:11.462
[both grunting]

01:11.506 --> 01:13.029
This wasn't supposed to happen.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.117
Get away from us.

01:14.161 --> 01:16.293
-RAYNER: Captain?
-System shows

01:16.337 --> 01:18.426
it's a Terran warp pod.
Two life signs,

01:18.469 --> 01:19.862
sickbay equipment.
It's got to be

01:19.905 --> 01:21.515
-a life-support system.
-It's Moll and L'ak.

01:21.559 --> 01:22.908
We'll find them.

01:22.952 --> 01:24.127
RAYNER:
They left a warp signature.

01:24.170 --> 01:25.433
We'll track it.

01:25.476 --> 01:28.088
Paul is prepping to do
a full chemical analysis

01:28.131 --> 01:29.654
of this vial.

01:29.698 --> 01:32.701
And then we'll have
our next stop.

01:42.058 --> 01:44.843
STAMETS:
You think the scientists
designed these clues

01:44.887 --> 01:47.628
to mock you when you
can't figure them out?

01:47.672 --> 01:50.588
-I think this will work.
-BURNHAM: It better.

01:51.807 --> 01:53.852
This clue's been
stalling us for two days.

01:53.896 --> 01:55.941
-Any other tests we can run?
-STAMETS: That'll tell us

01:55.985 --> 01:57.247
something different than the

01:57.291 --> 01:59.031
hundred other tests
we've already run?

01:59.075 --> 02:00.120
I don't think so.

02:00.163 --> 02:02.252
Vial's composition's

02:02.296 --> 02:06.169
generic, and the water
inside remains pure,

02:06.213 --> 02:09.346
inert, distilled, and wet.

02:09.389 --> 02:12.393
Vial's damaged.
Maybe there's a piece missing.

02:12.436 --> 02:15.222
TILLY:
Modified spectral analysis
reveals the fluid

02:15.265 --> 02:16.919
in this vial to be...

02:16.962 --> 02:20.140
-still just distilled water.
-STAMETS: Damn.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.796
The other clues had words,

02:24.840 --> 02:28.278
had symbols, they had more.

02:28.322 --> 02:30.411
STAMETS:
You know,
I have reviewed scans from

02:30.454 --> 02:32.674
ISS Enterprisemultiple times.

02:32.716 --> 02:34.502
There was never
anything else there.

02:34.545 --> 02:36.067
[machine beeps]

02:36.112 --> 02:38.332
STAMETS:
I even tried fabricating
the last two pieces

02:38.375 --> 02:39.594
of the map to see what'd happen

02:39.637 --> 02:40.725
when I put them in, and...

02:40.769 --> 02:42.162
Let me guess, nothing.

02:43.337 --> 02:44.686
There's no shortcuts here.

02:44.728 --> 02:46.731
We have to solve
this clue to find

02:46.775 --> 02:49.821
the next and then the next,
and we need all five.

02:49.865 --> 02:51.258
Then somehow
you are gonna tell us

02:51.301 --> 02:52.998
where the Progenitors' power is.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.652
So keep at it.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.654
If chemistry isn't the solution,

02:56.698 --> 02:58.569
try history, anthropology.

02:58.613 --> 03:00.223
Try planets
where distilled water

03:00.267 --> 03:02.921
had cultural or symbolic
significance 800 years ago.

03:02.965 --> 03:04.009
And include

03:04.053 --> 03:05.750
worlds that had severe droughts

03:05.794 --> 03:07.317
and would have needed
rainwater alternatives.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.754
-On it.
-Thank you.

03:24.291 --> 03:27.555
I still find it disorienting
myself sometimes.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.165
But you get used to it.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.168
Here I was, thinking
you were born in here.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.519
We could be at black alert
within the hour.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.651
What are our coordinates?

03:36.694 --> 03:38.000
Excuse me?

03:38.043 --> 03:39.523
I assume I'm here
because you have a lead

03:39.567 --> 03:40.698
on Moll and L'ak.

03:40.742 --> 03:43.091
Uh, no. Not yet.

03:43.135 --> 03:46.442
The USS Locherer
is handling the search.

03:46.487 --> 03:48.053
This is Discovery'smission.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.968
Finding the Progenitors'
technology

03:50.012 --> 03:51.448
is Discovery'smission,

03:51.492 --> 03:53.624
and you seem to have
your hands full at the moment.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.583
This particular clue...

03:55.626 --> 03:58.499
We are a bit stalled.

04:00.109 --> 04:03.199
The scientists who hid
the technology's location

04:03.243 --> 04:06.507
each made their own piece
of the clue trail in secret.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.813
Stands to reason
they would have employed

04:08.857 --> 04:10.859
their respective fields
of expertise

04:10.902 --> 04:12.817
in the process, don't you think?

04:13.601 --> 04:14.993
And then knowing

04:15.037 --> 04:17.257
the identity
of the vial's creator

04:17.300 --> 04:19.694
might prove useful.

04:19.737 --> 04:23.306
BURNHAM:
You found the names
of the scientists.

04:23.350 --> 04:25.569
I can be resourceful.

04:28.355 --> 04:30.487
I know it's eccentric of me,

04:30.531 --> 04:33.011
but I-I do love
the feel of paper.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.926
And this isn't
replicated either.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.146
This is a genuine 21st century

04:37.189 --> 04:39.235
legal pad.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.978
Where did you even find that?

04:43.021 --> 04:46.111
Like I said, I'm resourceful.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.592
And you have a mission
to see to.

05:26.326 --> 05:28.153
[both laughing]

05:30.286 --> 05:32.462
Zora, pause the program.

05:37.946 --> 05:39.991
Send a message to Dr. Pollard:

05:40.034 --> 05:42.733
"We might be on to
something with this

05:42.777 --> 05:44.735
grief-alleviation therapeutic."

05:46.128 --> 05:48.870
"Brain wave patterning
is incredible."

05:50.611 --> 05:53.135
"And this holo
of my grandmother is..."

05:55.703 --> 05:58.227
"...exactly as I remember her."

06:00.664 --> 06:03.188
"Sending over my data
in a few minutes."

06:06.888 --> 06:09.456
Zora, start the program again.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.710
No.

06:49.321 --> 06:50.888
Program, check the database.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.238
She should be able
to answer that.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.631
We spoke often

06:54.675 --> 06:56.677
about her spiritual feelings
and practices.

07:14.782 --> 07:17.001
-[chuckles]
-Of course.

07:17.045 --> 07:18.525
[chuckles]

07:20.527 --> 07:24.313
BURNHAM:
Okay, we haven't yet found clues
from Dr. Derex or Dr. Kreel.

07:24.356 --> 07:25.401
For the vial,

07:25.445 --> 07:27.011
I'm betting on Kreel.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.361
His specialty was designing
weather modification towers

07:29.405 --> 07:30.580
to generate rain.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.364
So, we're going to Denobula.

07:32.408 --> 07:35.498
Maybe not. Um, Zora,

07:35.542 --> 07:37.021
can you confirm,

07:37.065 --> 07:40.068
Denobulan weather towers
seed clouds

07:40.111 --> 07:43.158
-with silver iodide, right?
-ZORA: Yes, Commander.

07:43.201 --> 07:44.899
That is typical
of their function

07:44.942 --> 07:46.291
both at present and during

07:46.335 --> 07:47.554
Dr. Kreel's time.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.033
All right, so then the water

07:49.077 --> 07:51.732
would be filled
with contaminants,

07:51.775 --> 07:54.038
but it's ultra-distilled.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.779
Well, Kreel's file
also mentioned

07:55.823 --> 07:58.739
he did work in weather
technology for other worlds.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.481
If a planet were arid enough...

08:01.524 --> 08:03.700
Then water would have to be
extracted from the air

08:03.744 --> 08:05.049
at the molecular level,

08:05.093 --> 08:07.530
which would mean
no contaminants whatsoever.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.924
Zora, how many M-Class planets

08:09.967 --> 08:12.143
were on Denobulan trade routes
when this vial was created?

08:12.187 --> 08:13.449
15.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.798
And how many of them
were dry enough

08:14.842 --> 08:16.844
that water would need
to be harvested

08:16.887 --> 08:18.410
in that particular way?

08:18.454 --> 08:20.238
Only one, Captain.

08:20.282 --> 08:22.240
-[laughs]
-Halem'no.

08:22.284 --> 08:23.590
Whew.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.943
BURNHAM:
The planet Halem'no.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.859
Long-range scans show
a functioning weather tower

08:31.902 --> 08:33.730
of Denobulan design.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.950
It manufactures rain,

08:35.993 --> 08:37.952
and it emits
a low-grade forcefield

08:37.995 --> 08:40.432
that shields the planet's
only habitable region

08:40.476 --> 08:41.738
from dust storms.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.566
We've been able to confirm
that Dr. Kreel

08:43.610 --> 08:45.263
designed the tower,
so we believe

08:45.307 --> 08:47.396
the next clue is inside of it.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.703
Why would he make a weather
tower look like a mountain?

08:49.746 --> 08:51.052
That's a good question.

08:51.095 --> 08:54.098
Ensign Tal,
any life signs down there?

08:54.142 --> 08:55.709
ADIRA:
Uh...

08:55.752 --> 08:58.712
Yes. Uh... [stammers]
humanoid. Um...

08:58.755 --> 09:01.889
Uh, d-definitely pre-warp
and pre-industrial.

09:01.932 --> 09:04.108
Uh, there's no functioning

09:04.152 --> 09:05.545
electrical grid,

09:05.588 --> 09:07.938
and geological surveys show

09:07.982 --> 09:09.984
that the storms
on the planet have gotten

09:10.027 --> 09:13.422
increasingly more severe
over time, so...

09:13.465 --> 09:15.685
maybe Dr. Kreel
installed the tower

09:15.729 --> 09:17.600
as a humanitarian mission

09:17.644 --> 09:20.777
and hid it so not to violate
the Prime Directive?

09:20.821 --> 09:23.867
Makes sense. It's good to
see you on the bridge, Ensign.

09:23.911 --> 09:27.218
They requested more time up
here. I felt they were ready.

09:27.262 --> 09:29.307
[chuckles]:
Didn't necessarily mean today.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.005
No time like the present.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.441
BURNHAM:
Okay, so

09:32.484 --> 09:35.052
the Prime Directive will be
a concern for us, too.

09:35.096 --> 09:36.793
We'll need to get in and out
without revealing

09:36.837 --> 09:38.316
our technological capabilities.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.362
Can scans help us locate
the clue inside of that thing?

09:40.405 --> 09:44.322
No, there is an unusual energy
field surrounding the tower.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.933
Won't let me beam you in either.

09:45.976 --> 09:48.152
-Any idea why?
-ADIRA: Uh, not yet,

09:48.196 --> 09:50.720
-but we are working on it.
-BURNHAM: Okay. Well, while they

09:50.764 --> 09:52.635
get to the bottom of that,
I will head to the surface

09:52.679 --> 09:53.636
with Lieutenant Tilly.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.159
We'll have to get inside

09:55.203 --> 09:57.335
of that tower before Moll
and L'ak make their next move.

09:57.379 --> 09:59.642
Commander Asha,
get us as close to the planet

09:59.686 --> 10:01.688
as you can
without the ship being seen.

10:01.731 --> 10:03.777
-Aye, Captain.
-You have the conn, Rayner.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.996
RAYNER:
Aye, Captain.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.911
Let's get to it.

11:46.618 --> 11:47.837
Come.

11:51.667 --> 11:53.451
Look. The whistling.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.540
It's a component
of their language.

11:55.584 --> 11:58.456
Zora, can you play what they're
saying in Federation Standard?

Are you hurt?

VOICE 1:
No, but I am very thirsty.

12:07.552 --> 12:08.858
VOICE 2:
There is water for you here.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.774
Why would they speak
in whistles?

12:11.818 --> 12:13.515
They don't always.

12:13.558 --> 12:16.257
They have a phonetic language
for day-to-day interactions,

12:16.300 --> 12:17.737
but the whistle-speak

12:17.780 --> 12:19.782
lets them communicate
across great distances.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.262
It's not uncommon
to find in cultures

12:21.305 --> 12:23.612
before communication
technology evolves.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.962
You can learn so much
about a society

12:26.006 --> 12:29.183
by the way the individuals
speak to one another.

12:29.226 --> 12:31.141
Like the Halem'nites.

12:31.185 --> 12:32.577
[whistling]

12:32.621 --> 12:35.102
They don't have any terms

12:35.145 --> 12:38.061
to denote societal
status or class.

12:38.105 --> 12:41.021
They recognize three
distinct gender identities,

12:41.064 --> 12:43.284
and they prize connection
with one another

12:43.327 --> 12:45.199
despite the hardships
that they face.

12:45.242 --> 12:47.462
And look, look here,

12:47.505 --> 12:50.160
they have multiple words
for pain,

12:50.204 --> 12:52.989
injury, hurt, dust.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.817
I feel like I'm back
in Dr. T'Prasi's

12:54.861 --> 12:56.993
xenolinguistics seminar
on Vulcan.

12:57.037 --> 12:59.822
Wow, you can take the "xeno"
out of the anthropologist,

12:59.866 --> 13:01.737
but you can't take
the anthropologist out...

13:03.173 --> 13:04.566
Huh. No, I lost it.

13:04.609 --> 13:06.002
Uh...

13:06.046 --> 13:08.526
We could really use you
at the Starfleet Academy.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.267
Well, don't tempt me.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.574
How is it going over there,
by the way?

13:12.617 --> 13:15.272
RAYNER [over comm]:
Captain, we've loaded
subcutaneous comms

13:15.316 --> 13:17.187
into the transport system.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.710
Ensign Tal's also been
playing with Starfleet's

13:18.754 --> 13:20.364
latest retinal tricorder mod.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.844
Should come in handy
if you need to be discreet.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.367
Thank you, Commander.

13:23.411 --> 13:26.718
We're good to go. Take us down.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.904
Let's activate
retinal tricorders.

13:39.514 --> 13:42.691
Think Dr. Kreel could have
picked a more gigantic place

13:42.734 --> 13:44.824
to hide the clue?

13:44.867 --> 13:47.827
Guess that's why the Halem'nites
call it the High Summit.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.612
Must have known
it'd be well-protected,

13:50.655 --> 13:53.615
since they believe they can
commune with their gods there.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.056
So, do you want
to talk about it?

14:00.100 --> 14:02.015
-TILLY: Hmm?
-BURNHAM: The Academy?

14:02.058 --> 14:03.277
TILLY:
Oh, yeah.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.757
I just got a message
from my student today.

14:05.801 --> 14:08.325
Cadet Ross, she actually
served us drinks at

14:08.369 --> 14:10.545
-the Millennium Celebration.
-Yeah. Earnest, big smile?

14:10.588 --> 14:12.677
Yes. She's thinking
about leaving the Academy

14:12.721 --> 14:14.288
to take a position
on a cargo vessel,

14:14.331 --> 14:17.117
and she wants to know
if I think she should do it.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.640
Mm.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.903
-So what are you gonna say?
-I know.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.818
Stay? Don't go?
I don't know, and...

14:22.862 --> 14:25.908
She wants to leave at all,
and she's not the first.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.475
We're not giving the cadets
what they need.

14:27.518 --> 14:28.780
I don't know
what the problem is.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.347
[whistling in distance]

14:30.391 --> 14:32.001
TILLY:
The whistle-speak.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.612
BURNHAM:
The universal translator's
got it.

14:34.656 --> 14:37.267
GROUP:
We've come here from afar.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.487
LONE VOICE:
Let my voice call you home.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.271
[whistling]

14:41.315 --> 14:43.839
GROUP:
We traveled from the dust.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.147
LONE VOICE:
Come rest, you must.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.977
GROUP:
We journeyed from the storms.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.980
LONE VOICE:
In the summit, you'll be warm.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.852
Sounds like they're going
where we're going.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.946
Hey. There you are.
Got a minute?

15:03.990 --> 15:06.253
Yeah. Heading to Engineering.
How can I help?

15:06.296 --> 15:07.907
I wondered if you could
put me in touch

15:07.950 --> 15:09.430
with the ship's counselor
on the Locherer.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.562
When they find Moll and L'ak,
I want them to have

15:11.606 --> 15:12.955
a full background
and know they can use me

15:12.999 --> 15:14.348
as a resource for anything.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.653
I'm sure they've been briefed.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.307
-It's not the same.
-Book,

15:17.351 --> 15:19.788
you need to accept that there's
nothing for you to do right now.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.659
I can't just sit
on my hands, Hugh.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.139
So find something
to distract you.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.576
What's occupied your brain
in the past?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.143
Focus on that.

15:27.187 --> 15:29.667
Recharge yourself so that you're
ready when you are needed.

15:29.711 --> 15:33.149
You ever get tired
of having all the answers?

15:33.193 --> 15:35.630
I'll check in with you later.
[chuckles]

15:38.720 --> 15:42.158
Paul, I need your help
with something.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.551
Can I pull you away?

15:43.594 --> 15:45.683
I'm looking to do a full
neural scan on myself,

15:45.727 --> 15:47.685
and I could use an assistant.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.383
A neural scan?

15:49.426 --> 15:50.775
Is everything all right?

15:50.819 --> 15:52.342
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
everything's fine.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.778
We don't have a lot of data

15:53.822 --> 15:55.998
on the neurological aftereffects
of zhian'tara,

15:56.042 --> 15:58.827
-and this is a chance
to gather some.
-Are you

15:58.870 --> 16:01.656
-having aftereffects?
-No, no.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.528
-Maybe.
-Hugh,

16:04.572 --> 16:06.791
-are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah, of course.

16:06.835 --> 16:09.142
We need this data, and, uh,

16:09.185 --> 16:12.623
well, when was the last time
you and I got to work together?

16:12.667 --> 16:14.843
-Might be nice.
-Nothing as romantic

16:14.886 --> 16:17.019
-as a neural scan.
-[laughs]

16:17.063 --> 16:19.108
So, is that a yes?

16:19.152 --> 16:20.588
At your service.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.894
Great. I will, uh,
prep everything,

16:22.938 --> 16:24.200
and we can start in the morning.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.643
[whistling]

16:36.996 --> 16:40.260
Hello. Hello.

16:40.303 --> 16:42.523
Greetings, compeers.

16:42.566 --> 16:45.221
We heard your call.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.397
Sounds like you're headed
to the High Summit.

16:47.441 --> 16:51.619
Yes, we've been following the
beacon voice since the moonrise.

16:51.662 --> 16:54.578
We g-got lost. May we join you?

16:54.622 --> 16:57.407
Of course. We are nearly there.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.192
[coughing]

17:04.414 --> 17:07.635
[grunts] Apologies.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.942
I was clearing dust
from an orchard

17:10.986 --> 17:14.511
and lost my way
in the Dry Lands.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.777
The Dry Lands.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.779
Were you out there very long?

17:21.823 --> 17:24.217
I breathed dust
for an entire night

17:24.260 --> 17:27.307
before the sun rose
and my compeers could rescue me.

17:27.349 --> 17:29.483
-Sounds frightening.
-[coughs]

17:29.526 --> 17:30.745
I suppose it is why

17:30.788 --> 17:32.790
they encourage elders

17:32.834 --> 17:35.967
not to take turns at
the edge of the storms.

17:36.011 --> 17:39.101
[wheezing] But i-if
I did not clear the dust,

17:39.145 --> 17:41.843
another would need
to take my place.

17:42.887 --> 17:45.455
-Where are you coming from?
-Uh...

17:45.499 --> 17:47.283
we came to worship
at the High Summit.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.591
Ah, you wish to pray for rain.

17:50.634 --> 17:54.160
We have been without it
for too long.

17:54.203 --> 17:57.250
Do any of the compeers go
inside the summit to pray?

17:57.293 --> 18:00.122
Only the chosen devout
may enter the temple.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.646
-Surely you know that.
-Of course,

18:02.690 --> 18:04.648
but... being from

18:04.692 --> 18:07.303
the east, the distance is far.

18:07.347 --> 18:08.783
Bless you, dear child,

18:08.826 --> 18:11.307
you've never seen
the High Summit before.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.135
No, no, we never have.

18:13.179 --> 18:16.399
But for years
we have longed to visit.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.140
[chuckles weakly]

18:18.184 --> 18:19.533
The day is here.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.839
[chuckles]

18:21.883 --> 18:24.494
RAVAH:
Compeers, you've arrived.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.148
I'm Ravah.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.324
It's my voice
that's been beckoning you home.

18:28.368 --> 18:31.066
Please come with me.
I have water and food ahead.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.372
[Anorah wheezing]

18:32.415 --> 18:34.678
[coughing]

18:34.722 --> 18:36.376
She's having trouble breathing.

18:36.419 --> 18:38.508
The Healing Grove, quickly.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.684
[coughing]

18:46.342 --> 18:49.084
Her medicine.
I saw her inhaling it

18:49.128 --> 18:50.390
-when we were walking.
-Maybe it's in her pack.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.741
[coughing]

18:55.046 --> 18:57.092
[sighs] Her lungs
are full of dust.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.877
A sonic percussion wave
would easily dislodge this.

18:59.921 --> 19:01.618
She doesn't
have to die from this.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.403
We can't break
the Prime Directive.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.231
No, I know, I know, I know.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.016
They're not finding
her medicine.

19:08.059 --> 19:10.018
Okay. Help me get her
on her side.

19:14.022 --> 19:15.763
RAVAH:
There they are, Father.

19:15.806 --> 19:18.069
Do not stop, compeer.
You're keeping her alive.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.246
Give these out.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.248
One to each.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.641
OHVAHZ:
Quickly.

19:24.685 --> 19:26.208
Form a tight circle around her.

19:29.690 --> 19:33.433
Stay strong, my good compeer.

19:33.476 --> 19:36.175
[bowls clanging]

19:43.486 --> 19:45.923
[coughing continues]

19:59.937 --> 20:02.157
[bowls continue clanging]

20:04.159 --> 20:06.205
[coughing]

20:20.697 --> 20:22.046
OHVAHZ:
You must forgive me.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.006
I did not have time to warn you

20:25.049 --> 20:27.226
of the intensity
of the sound cure.

20:27.269 --> 20:30.490
It's amazing that
you found a cure at all.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.187
Really impressive.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.016
TILLY:
Hey, you're awake.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.147
[grunts]

20:36.191 --> 20:37.845
Ravah here's been telling me

20:37.888 --> 20:39.586
all about the High Summit.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.501
RAVAH:
I, too, was born far away.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.285
My father brought me here
after my mother died

20:43.329 --> 20:45.026
and he became priest
of the summit.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.506
OHVAHZ:
Let her regain
her strength, Ravah.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.116
RAVAH:
But they were
on the front lines.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.204
When my turn comes,
I'll clear that dust

20:49.248 --> 20:50.510
twice as fast as anyone else.

20:50.553 --> 20:51.946
OHVAHZ:
Ravah,

20:51.989 --> 20:53.861
the most important thing
is to work in harmony

20:53.904 --> 20:55.471
with the rest of your compeers.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.691
Of course you're right, Father.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.694
But it's clear
you're very strong.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.696
We're eager to enter
the High Summit,

21:02.739 --> 21:04.350
to give thanks to the gods.

21:04.393 --> 21:07.527
The gods do not require you to
enter the temple to give thanks.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.398
RAVAH:
But you could get in
if you wanted to.

21:09.442 --> 21:12.227
You just have to complete the
Journey of the Mother Compeer.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.795
-Ravah, please.
-Journey of the Mother Compeer?

21:14.838 --> 21:17.276
It's a race and a test
of devotion because

21:17.319 --> 21:19.060
it's quite grueling. Everyone
says that we're due because

21:19.103 --> 21:20.714
watching the race
makes the gods happy,

21:20.757 --> 21:22.542
and we've been
without rain for so long.

21:22.585 --> 21:25.458
Only the one who wins is worthy
of entering the temple.

21:25.501 --> 21:26.894
There, they're close to the gods

21:26.937 --> 21:28.374
and they can ask
for their blessing.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.114
OHVAHZ:
Let's discuss
another time, Ravah.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.855
Our compeers only just arrived.

21:31.899 --> 21:33.074
BURNHAM:
But we wish to show our devotion

21:33.117 --> 21:34.554
in whatever way we can.

21:34.597 --> 21:35.729
RAVAH:
And this is perfect.

21:35.772 --> 21:36.773
If you make the request,

21:36.817 --> 21:38.079
we could do it tomorrow morning.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.559
Isn't that right, Father?

21:39.602 --> 21:41.561
One just has to make the
request, that's how it works.

21:41.604 --> 21:42.562
Hmm.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.303
Then I make the request.

21:45.782 --> 21:49.003
Nothing's more important to us
than entering that summit.

22:02.408 --> 22:04.366
â™ª

22:24.081 --> 22:25.126
Oh.

22:25.169 --> 22:26.954
Good morning, compeers.
[chuckles]

22:26.997 --> 22:29.130
Are there any messages
you'd like me

22:29.173 --> 22:31.132
to bring to the gods
when I see them?

22:31.175 --> 22:32.612
-You're running today?
-Mm.

22:32.655 --> 22:35.919
You've inspired me,
as you've inspired the others.

22:35.963 --> 22:38.095
The difficulty
of the Journey is legendary.

22:38.139 --> 22:39.749
Most don't even finish.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.534
OHVAHZ:
Ravah,

22:41.577 --> 22:42.839
may I have a word?

22:42.883 --> 22:45.886
No, Father, I'm getting ready.

22:45.929 --> 22:49.019
You are too young
to take the Journey.

22:49.063 --> 22:51.805
I'm stronger
than you think I am.

22:52.893 --> 22:55.330
You're wearing that today?

22:57.680 --> 22:59.378
I wish for Mother
to watch over me.

23:01.554 --> 23:04.121
Ravah, I promised her that...

23:04.165 --> 23:05.645
You would keep me
a child forever?

23:05.688 --> 23:07.081
OHVAHZ:
No. That I would protect you.

23:07.124 --> 23:10.432
RAVAH:
I've grown, Father.

23:10.476 --> 23:12.303
I'm devoted. You must see that.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.784
HALEM'NITE:
Excuse me, compeer,
tradition demands we begin

23:14.828 --> 23:16.307
the preparations.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.614
As you wish.

23:25.229 --> 23:28.276
You know, I-I have a student,
um...

23:28.319 --> 23:30.452
back East.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.193
She reminds me a lot of you.

23:32.236 --> 23:35.283
She just wants to get out there
and do, as fast as she can.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.459
It can be hard to even...

23:37.503 --> 23:40.244
just as a teacher, to step back.

23:41.463 --> 23:44.858
I can only imagine what it
would be like as a parent.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.034
My father is a great man.

23:47.077 --> 23:50.211
And I want to show him
that I can be great, too.

23:50.254 --> 23:54.302
Compeer, uh,
may I have a moment?

23:56.870 --> 23:59.133
BURNHAM [over comm]:
We're alone,Discovery.
We don't have much time.

23:59.176 --> 24:00.526
RAYNER:
We'll talk fast, then.

24:00.569 --> 24:01.918
Ensign Tal chased down a hunch

24:01.962 --> 24:03.616
and found something interesting.

24:03.659 --> 24:06.445
Uh, I did
a historical regression

24:06.488 --> 24:08.098
of Halem'no's weather patterns,

24:08.142 --> 24:09.926
and the data indicated that

24:09.970 --> 24:12.015
there might have been other
weather towers in the past.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.408
RAYNER:
We sent down a team of DOTs

24:13.452 --> 24:14.888
into the dust storm
to check it out.

24:14.931 --> 24:18.065
-They found four more towers.
-Yeah.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.241
Over time, the others failed.

24:20.284 --> 24:23.070
Uh, their energy-distribution
matrices fell out of alignment,

24:23.113 --> 24:26.029
and that's the same thing that's
happening to the High Summit.

24:26.073 --> 24:27.901
That's what's causing the
energy field that's stopping us

24:27.944 --> 24:29.293
from beaming you inside
for the clue.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.991
BURNHAM:
Okay, what's the solve?

24:31.034 --> 24:33.254
All of the towers have
an auxiliary control panel

24:33.297 --> 24:34.516
hidden nearby.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.257
If you can find the one
near the High Summit,

24:36.300 --> 24:38.041
it should be easy enough
to reset any of the components

24:38.085 --> 24:39.478
that have failed over time.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.088
TILLY:
Adira, were there settlements

24:41.131 --> 24:42.524
around any of the other
weather towers?

24:42.568 --> 24:44.221
At all of them, in fact.

24:44.265 --> 24:46.006
They were destroyed
when the towers failed.

24:46.049 --> 24:48.922
So, if we don't fix this one,
everyone here will die.

24:48.965 --> 24:51.620
Thank you, Discovery.

24:51.664 --> 24:54.405
One mission just became two.

24:54.449 --> 24:57.931
Well, we've checked
for biological, chemical,

24:57.974 --> 25:00.673
and genetic anomalies, and, um,

25:00.716 --> 25:04.111
turns out you have
a perfectly typical,

25:04.154 --> 25:07.418
healthy and rather handsome

25:07.462 --> 25:08.637
human brain.

25:08.681 --> 25:11.945
So, no lasting
neurological effects

25:11.988 --> 25:14.208
of zhian'tara whatsoever?

25:14.251 --> 25:15.731
None.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.785
There's something
you're not saying.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.570
It's just, I was...

25:28.614 --> 25:30.485
hoping these scans would...

25:30.529 --> 25:32.618
give me an answer.

25:32.661 --> 25:36.796
You know, a physiological cause
for what I'm feeling, and...

25:36.839 --> 25:39.320
then I'd understand,
then I could talk about it.

25:39.363 --> 25:40.495
I don't understand.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.453
Are you feeling sick, or...?

25:42.497 --> 25:43.846
No. Uh...

25:43.890 --> 25:46.283
the opposite.

25:48.329 --> 25:51.071
Ever since Trill, I've...

25:51.114 --> 25:55.162
felt more connected,
more, um...

25:55.205 --> 25:56.903
attuned

25:56.946 --> 25:59.427
to something
greater than myself.

26:01.385 --> 26:03.170
Greater than all of us.

26:04.171 --> 26:07.914
But if there's no scientific
reason for it, then...

26:07.957 --> 26:11.308
So it's a... spiritual thing?

26:14.094 --> 26:16.400
Hey, what matters most
is that you're okay.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.359
The scans would have
picked up anything

26:18.402 --> 26:19.882
with health implications.

26:19.926 --> 26:22.798
So, in lieu of that, I say

26:22.842 --> 26:25.192
why don't you just enjoy it?

26:26.193 --> 26:27.237
Really?

26:28.195 --> 26:31.198
The human brain,
with its billions of neurons,

26:31.241 --> 26:33.679
each with thousands
of connection points,

26:33.722 --> 26:35.855
is one of the most
complex things

26:35.898 --> 26:36.943
in the known universe.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.467
[chuckles]:
So...

26:39.510 --> 26:42.122
enjoy it.

26:42.165 --> 26:43.384
Right. [chuckles]

26:50.043 --> 26:52.611
[indistinct conversation]

26:55.439 --> 26:59.661
BURNHAM:
The race is about to begin.
Are you not happy, compeer?

26:59.705 --> 27:01.620
Are you not enjoying today?

27:01.663 --> 27:05.232
I was thinking of the last time
there was a Journey.

27:05.275 --> 27:06.363
I ran.

27:06.407 --> 27:09.366
As did my friend Vohrahli.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.238
She was so fast.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.632
Of course she won.
[chuckles softly]

27:13.675 --> 27:15.895
It was long ago.

27:15.938 --> 27:18.027
I am thinking about Vohrahli

27:18.071 --> 27:21.378
and what we might look like
if we could be wrinkled,

27:21.422 --> 27:24.207
old elders together. [laughs]

27:24.251 --> 27:26.862
-You would look beautiful.
-[chuckles]

27:26.906 --> 27:30.692
You know, you need not go
to the High Summit

27:30.736 --> 27:32.259
to be with the gods.

27:32.302 --> 27:35.088
They are with us when
we do good for one another,

27:35.131 --> 27:37.438
when we love,
when we save each other,

27:37.481 --> 27:39.962
as you saved me.

27:40.006 --> 27:43.096
You don't need to run
to see them.

27:43.139 --> 27:44.532
I know, I...

27:44.575 --> 27:47.230
It's something that
I've dreamed of my whole life.

27:48.492 --> 27:50.538
I understand then,

27:50.581 --> 27:53.672
and I shall pray for you.

27:59.329 --> 28:01.680
Everything all right?

28:01.723 --> 28:03.072
I think so.

28:03.116 --> 28:05.031
OHVAHZ:
My good and blessed compeers,

28:05.074 --> 28:07.947
it is our great fortune
to bear witness

28:07.990 --> 28:11.080
to the Journey of the
Mother Compeer today.

28:11.124 --> 28:14.127
Legend tells us that,
in ancient times,

28:14.170 --> 28:16.956
all of Halem'no
was fertile and gentle,

28:16.999 --> 28:19.828
but even in such a land of
plenty, the Halem'nites warred

28:19.872 --> 28:22.657
against each other
and lost the favor of the gods.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.573
To punish us, they brought
the dust storms.

28:25.616 --> 28:27.967
We would have ended our days

28:28.010 --> 28:31.274
in thirst and dust
if the Great Mother Compeer

28:31.318 --> 28:33.712
hadn't shown the gods
our true selves.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.757
She ventured out into

28:35.801 --> 28:38.064
the storms and traveled far
to find water

28:38.107 --> 28:40.675
for her children.
As she journeyed back with it,

28:40.719 --> 28:42.459
her lungs filled with dust.

28:42.503 --> 28:44.505
-[coughing]
-OHVAHZ: Her thirst
was terrible,

28:44.548 --> 28:46.637
-and yet she didn't drink
a single drop.
-[others coughing]

28:46.681 --> 28:48.814
She reached her children
and gave them

28:48.857 --> 28:50.990
the life-giving water.
She saved them,

28:51.033 --> 28:53.688
then breathed her last.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.778
The gods were so moved
by her sacrifice,

28:56.822 --> 28:58.867
they brought back the rains.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.304
Today, as you journey around

29:01.348 --> 29:03.785
the High Summit
bearing a terrible thirst,

29:03.829 --> 29:05.656
you, too, will endure this test.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.964
May you remind the gods
of the Mother Compeer,

29:09.008 --> 29:12.098
of her devotion, our devotion,

29:12.141 --> 29:13.795
and earn their merciful rain.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.797
[grunting]

29:15.841 --> 29:17.407
[gasps, coughs]

29:17.451 --> 29:19.192
A courageous attempt, compeers,

29:19.235 --> 29:21.542
but you are now disqualified.

29:21.585 --> 29:22.891
Begin.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.458
Try not to fall behind.

29:24.501 --> 29:26.503
-[crowd cheering]
-We have to get that clue.

29:26.547 --> 29:29.115
[coughing]

29:42.737 --> 29:44.608
[panting]

29:57.404 --> 29:59.145
BURNHAM:
Just one minute.

29:59.188 --> 30:00.886
I just need a minute.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.757
[groans]

30:02.801 --> 30:05.978
[whispering]:
Body in motion remains
in motion.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.588
[Burnham groans]

30:07.631 --> 30:10.243
They've all got to get water
at some point, right?

30:10.286 --> 30:12.071
And we have endurance,
we have...

30:12.114 --> 30:13.376
Starfleet training.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.988
Yeah, keep telling
yourself that.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.554
Let's go.
We're gonna fall behind.

30:17.598 --> 30:20.166
-[panting]
-A body in motion...

30:20.209 --> 30:22.472
will remain in motion.

30:23.256 --> 30:26.433
[both panting]

30:28.478 --> 30:31.090
TILLY:
Body in motion stays in motion.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.744
Wait, wait, what's that?

30:33.788 --> 30:35.572
Body at rest. [whimpers]

30:35.616 --> 30:38.401
Look at the moss on the trees.

30:38.445 --> 30:39.968
Most of it's blue,
but some of it's yellow.

30:40.012 --> 30:42.579
That's a genetic mutation.

30:42.623 --> 30:44.451
If a control panel
were 800 years old,

30:44.494 --> 30:46.975
it would leak radiation, right?

30:47.019 --> 30:48.194
And if it is leaking radiation,

30:48.237 --> 30:51.153
it would be causing mutations.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.375
If I'm right, then this moss
would lead to a control panel.

30:55.418 --> 30:57.725
And if you're wrong?

30:57.768 --> 31:00.771
Then one of us still needs
to win this race

31:00.815 --> 31:02.599
and get that clue.

31:02.643 --> 31:03.513
Go.

31:03.557 --> 31:06.081
-Really?
-Go chase your moss.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.692
I'm the queen of endurance.

31:08.736 --> 31:11.913
-Body in motion...
-Remains in motion.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.829
[gasping]

31:14.873 --> 31:17.701
I'm out.

31:17.745 --> 31:19.442
[grunts]

31:30.976 --> 31:33.587
[panting]

31:46.339 --> 31:47.601
-[sighs]
-No.

31:47.644 --> 31:50.430
No, don't give up now, compeer.

31:50.473 --> 31:52.214
It's just the two of us left,

31:52.258 --> 31:53.650
and I want some
real competition.

31:53.694 --> 31:55.435
You're a little shit,
you know that?

31:55.478 --> 31:57.176
I can't hear you,
I'm too far ahead.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.960
Don't think
I'm not gonna beat you.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.483
Okay?

32:00.527 --> 32:02.355
Get over here. Come here.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.598
[tricorder trilling]

32:36.780 --> 32:39.000
Discovery,I've found
the tower control panel.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.785
Scanning it now.

32:45.572 --> 32:48.923
[sighs] This tech requires
periodic maintenance.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.056
Without that, it was bound
to fail eventually.

32:51.099 --> 32:53.667
BURNHAM:
So how do I fix it?

32:55.364 --> 32:58.628
Uh, you'll need to rebuild
the motherboard,

32:58.672 --> 33:00.891
uh, without shutting it down
by accident.

33:00.935 --> 33:03.459
No pressure. Tell me what to do.

33:03.503 --> 33:07.028
Uh, do you see a small red chip

33:07.072 --> 33:08.508
on the far left-hand side?

33:08.551 --> 33:10.249
BURNHAM:
Yes. I see a lot of them.

33:10.292 --> 33:12.860
ADIRA:
Sorry, in the top left corner.

33:12.903 --> 33:16.429
We'll start by rerouting that
to the override system.

33:16.951 --> 33:19.432
RAVAH:
We're almost there.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.218
OHVAHZ:
Stop.

33:23.262 --> 33:26.395
Near the end of the
Mother Compeer's Journey,

33:26.439 --> 33:28.223
the gods tempted her to drink.

33:28.267 --> 33:29.964
So, our final two racers

33:30.008 --> 33:31.444
must now complete the Journey

33:31.487 --> 33:33.272
while carrying temptation.

33:44.761 --> 33:47.764
[muffled cheering]

33:51.420 --> 33:53.205
[crowd cheering, applause]

34:09.221 --> 34:11.527
RAVAH:
No!

34:11.571 --> 34:13.572
[murmuring]

34:15.661 --> 34:18.578
OHVAHZ:
Spilling your water
is a disqualification, Ravah.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.275
Please, child,

34:20.319 --> 34:22.147
come, slake your thirst.

34:23.016 --> 34:25.802
A racer cannot complete
the journey with an empty bowl.

34:25.846 --> 34:28.501
-It was a noble effort, Ravah.
-[cheering]

34:34.855 --> 34:36.335
Come, Ravah.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.989
Come.

34:40.034 --> 34:41.469
Ravah.

34:44.038 --> 34:47.694
I thought you were gonna
give me a little competition.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.696
It's over.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.833
TILLY:
Come on.

34:56.877 --> 34:58.705
Come on. Up.

34:58.748 --> 34:59.923
Come on.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.186
Up.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.930
Let's go meet the gods together.

35:06.974 --> 35:09.194
[crowd cheering, applauding]

35:22.816 --> 35:24.644
-[device chirps]
-BURNHAM: Okay, that wasn't it.

35:24.687 --> 35:26.950
I'm gonna try
another isolinear chip.

35:26.994 --> 35:29.997
Sir, maybe we should get
someone with more experience

35:30.040 --> 35:31.607
to help support the captain.

35:31.651 --> 35:34.175
You're the one who wanted
to be on the bridge.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.872
-I know, um, but...
-But nothing.

35:35.916 --> 35:38.048
I wouldn't have agreed if I
thought you couldn't handle it.

35:38.092 --> 35:39.224
You've been
second-guessing yourself

35:39.267 --> 35:40.834
since that time bug came
on board.

35:40.877 --> 35:42.575
That's not on you.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.316
Understood?

35:45.621 --> 35:48.363
BURNHAM:
Got it.
Okay, Ensign, what's next?

35:48.407 --> 35:52.150
Last step, right? Bring it home.

35:55.675 --> 35:56.806
Okay.

35:56.850 --> 35:59.244
Uh, Captain,
I need you to bypass

35:59.287 --> 36:01.202
the auxiliary power circuit.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.422
-Bypass?
-Yank it out, Captain.

36:06.294 --> 36:08.253
Come on, come on.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.475
We got lights.

36:13.519 --> 36:15.042
Yes.

36:15.085 --> 36:17.218
Okay, I will have you beaming
into the tower in no time.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.220
Nice work, Ensign.

36:20.221 --> 36:22.397
Tilly, we solved
the interference issue.

36:22.441 --> 36:24.878
-Where are you now?
-TILLY: I'm in the temple.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.053
You won the race?

36:26.096 --> 36:28.664
Ravah and I tied.
We're both here.

36:28.708 --> 36:30.927
Problem is, I don't see
the clue anywhere.

36:30.971 --> 36:32.494
BURNHAM: Well, we just got
the control panel back on line,

36:32.538 --> 36:33.930
so we'll be able to transport

36:33.974 --> 36:35.932
a team over
in just a few minutes.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.107
OHVAHZ:
It is time.

36:37.151 --> 36:39.806
Hang on. Ohvahz is speaking.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.686
RAVAH:
Don't be sad, Father.

36:50.730 --> 36:52.906
We'll speak to the gods.
We'll bring the rain.

36:52.949 --> 36:56.388
OHVAHZ:
And we are so grateful
to you both.

36:57.215 --> 36:58.694
Your sacrifice

36:58.738 --> 37:01.262
will bless Halem'no
for many seasons to come.

37:01.306 --> 37:03.264
Sacrifice?

37:03.308 --> 37:05.179
RAVAH:
Take this, Father.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.181
I won't need it
to remember Mother anymore.

37:07.225 --> 37:09.444
Tilly, get out of there now.

37:10.315 --> 37:12.273
Uh, no, uh, Ohvahz.

37:12.317 --> 37:15.972
Wait. Wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

37:16.016 --> 37:17.278
Ohvahz!

37:17.322 --> 37:18.758
Discovery,
can you beam her out?

37:18.801 --> 37:20.499
RAYNER:
We can't get a lock, Captain.

37:20.542 --> 37:21.848
Ohvahz!

37:21.891 --> 37:23.676
[rumbling, creaking]

37:48.048 --> 37:49.528
Discovery,status report.

37:49.571 --> 37:51.138
Have you been able to get
a lock on Lieutenant Tilly?

37:51.181 --> 37:52.313
Nothing's working, Captain.

37:52.357 --> 37:53.619
Something's scrambling
my signal.

37:53.662 --> 37:54.837
TILLY:
I think I know why.

37:54.881 --> 37:56.665
These walls are solid tritanium.

37:56.709 --> 37:59.059
BURNHAM: Which is too dense
for a transport lock. Damn it.

37:59.102 --> 38:00.800
If it's not thing,
it's another with this place.

38:00.843 --> 38:02.671
Okay, it looks like
you're in the vacuum chamber.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.412
Chemicals come up
that center column

38:04.456 --> 38:06.284
and mix with air and whatnot
from the room above

38:06.327 --> 38:08.721
and get shot into the atmosphere
to make it rain.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.418
And seeing
that it's a vacuum chamber,

38:10.462 --> 38:12.159
I'm guessing that,
in the process,

38:12.202 --> 38:13.639
it sucks all the air
out of there.

38:13.682 --> 38:15.205
Makes sense the room's
made of tritanium.

38:15.249 --> 38:16.598
If it weren't, it'd crumple.

38:16.642 --> 38:18.992
Oh, good, at least
we won't get smushed.

38:19.035 --> 38:20.559
RAVAH:
Who are you speaking to?

38:21.429 --> 38:23.779
Oh, um, just
praying to the gods.

38:23.823 --> 38:25.999
That's, that's good.
They'll be pleased.

38:26.042 --> 38:28.175
[mechanical clicking]

38:38.925 --> 38:41.275
[low click]

38:42.929 --> 38:44.887
[quietly]:
The air.

38:44.931 --> 38:46.976
No, we need more time. Uh...

38:47.020 --> 38:48.761
The gods are coming.

38:48.804 --> 38:51.764
They'll take our breath
and replace it with their own.

38:52.634 --> 38:54.375
You look frightened, compeer.

38:54.419 --> 38:57.335
-Are you frightened?
-No, I'm not frightened. Um...

38:58.118 --> 38:59.641
I'm sad.

39:01.426 --> 39:03.819
You wouldn't be here
if it weren't for me.

39:03.863 --> 39:05.386
I'm grateful.

39:05.430 --> 39:07.867
I'm going to see the gods.

39:07.910 --> 39:11.000
Come, the serenity wall is here.

39:11.044 --> 39:13.568
We'll pray together,
you won't be frightened anymore.

39:13.612 --> 39:15.831
BURNHAM:
Tilly, I'm coming to get you.

39:15.875 --> 39:17.529
Discovery,if you cannot
beam her out,

39:17.572 --> 39:20.270
beam me in, as close
to that chamber as possible.

39:20.314 --> 39:21.663
Okay, there's a control room
right next to it.

39:21.707 --> 39:24.492
Sir, I'm picking up
a life sign in there.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.407
BURNHAM:
Okay, that has to be Ohvahz.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.017
We have to wait
for him to leave.

39:28.061 --> 39:30.324
-No, you beam me in now.
-You'd be revealing yourself

39:30.368 --> 39:33.588
-to a pre-warp civilization.
-I'm aware.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.634
We're gonna have to answer for
the Prime Directive violation.

39:35.677 --> 39:38.680
And we will. We are not
letting them die for no reason.

39:38.724 --> 39:40.378
If the Halem'nites can't
maintain this technology,

39:40.421 --> 39:41.553
they're gonna get wiped out
sooner or later.

39:41.596 --> 39:43.555
Either way, we have to do this.

39:43.598 --> 39:45.644
RAYNER:
Aye, Captain. Stand by.

39:45.687 --> 39:49.125
TILLY:
These symbols here,
what do they mean?

39:49.169 --> 39:50.953
They're numbers
to help us recall

39:50.997 --> 39:52.999
the five serenity prayers.

39:53.042 --> 39:57.612
If we say them, we'll find
peace before we pass.

39:57.656 --> 39:58.961
It's foretold.

39:59.005 --> 40:02.051
I don't see any numbers.

40:02.095 --> 40:04.227
I thought you were a teacher.

40:05.054 --> 40:06.621
I am.

40:06.665 --> 40:09.450
They don't teach
Ancient Halem'nese in the East?

40:09.494 --> 40:11.670
[exhales]

40:17.676 --> 40:19.286
One.

40:23.508 --> 40:25.118
Two.

40:32.255 --> 40:34.214
Three.

40:34.257 --> 40:36.695
We're in the third summit.

40:38.653 --> 40:40.220
Four.

40:43.484 --> 40:45.878
-Five.
-TILLY: I've seen
this symbol before.

40:45.921 --> 40:48.533
RAVAH:
To represent each of the summits
there once were.

40:48.576 --> 40:50.709
The gods destroyed
all the others.

40:52.275 --> 40:54.190
But left only ours.

40:56.018 --> 40:59.195
That's why we must sacrifice.

40:59.239 --> 41:02.024
To show them that we are
worthy of their gift.

41:13.035 --> 41:16.430
[crying]:
I'm sorry, compeer.

41:16.474 --> 41:17.475
Oh.

41:18.301 --> 41:19.955
It's okay to be scared.

41:19.999 --> 41:22.349
I don't want to die.

41:22.392 --> 41:25.308
I only took the Journey to make
my father proud, but now...

41:27.049 --> 41:28.398
Come here.

41:28.442 --> 41:30.662
Yeah, it's okay.

41:30.705 --> 41:33.665
It's okay. Come here.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.580
[shushes]

41:38.147 --> 41:41.542
Maybe the gods will figure out
a way to spare us.

41:46.591 --> 41:50.377
OHVAHZ:
I've failed you,
my heart's compeer.

41:51.639 --> 41:55.817
I wanted to forbid our child
from taking the Journey.

41:55.861 --> 41:57.906
But how could I?

41:57.950 --> 41:59.342
How could I be selfish

41:59.386 --> 42:01.910
when all our people suffer
for each other?

42:03.433 --> 42:04.696
What?

42:04.739 --> 42:06.524
You? How did you...

42:06.567 --> 42:07.655
Where did you come from?

42:07.699 --> 42:09.222
I need you to open this door.

42:09.265 --> 42:10.397
You're not really here,

42:10.440 --> 42:13.139
-vision.
-I am here. Listen to me.

42:13.182 --> 42:16.272
You have to open this door.

42:16.316 --> 42:18.057
-Ravah is going to see the gods.
-My friend is in there.

42:18.100 --> 42:19.798
-You feel grief
because you are selfish.
-She doesn't want to die

42:19.841 --> 42:21.364
and she doesn't need to die.

42:21.408 --> 42:23.236
-Ravah doesn't need to die.
-[mutters]

42:23.279 --> 42:24.542
-Your people need you
to be stronger.
-Ohvahz, Ohvahz,

42:24.585 --> 42:26.413
we are standing
inside of a machine.

42:26.456 --> 42:28.458
This is a piece of technology.

42:29.808 --> 42:31.461
Technology?

42:31.505 --> 42:34.073
It was placed here hundreds
of years ago by an alien race.

42:34.116 --> 42:36.597
The sacrifices
don't bring the rain.

42:36.641 --> 42:39.121
Okay? Technology does.

42:40.383 --> 42:41.471
No.

42:41.515 --> 42:43.604
No, you imagine
what you wish to hear,

42:43.648 --> 42:45.084
but you have a duty.

42:45.127 --> 42:48.087
Please deliver me from...

42:48.130 --> 42:50.829
-Deliver me.
-[thumping]

42:50.872 --> 42:52.004
Tilly,

42:52.047 --> 42:54.484
are you hearing all this?

42:54.528 --> 42:56.269
I... I am.

42:56.312 --> 42:57.836
But we're running out of air.

42:57.879 --> 42:59.446
BURNHAM: I'm gonna get you
out of there, okay?

42:59.489 --> 43:01.187
I need you to talk to Ravah

43:01.230 --> 43:02.884
and see if they can
help me reach Ohvahz.

43:02.928 --> 43:04.059
Ravah.

43:04.103 --> 43:05.887
[grunts softly]

43:05.931 --> 43:07.628
TILLY:
Do you remember your mother?

43:07.672 --> 43:11.197
-RAVAH: I do.
-What do you remember about her?

43:13.808 --> 43:18.117
There was a song
to help me sleep.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.946
They sang it together.

43:20.989 --> 43:24.123
We were once together.

43:26.168 --> 43:28.954
Will you teach it to me?

43:28.997 --> 43:31.652
I'll sing it to you
while you fall asleep.

43:31.696 --> 43:36.483
I don't remember the words.

43:36.526 --> 43:38.659
Only the tune.

43:38.703 --> 43:41.009
Yeah, the tune's enough.

43:44.534 --> 43:46.536
[humming]

43:53.848 --> 43:57.330
[Ravah humming over comm]

44:01.377 --> 44:03.379
[humming]

44:15.783 --> 44:17.785
[Ohvahz shuddering]

44:17.829 --> 44:20.832
How do you know that song?

44:20.875 --> 44:23.008
I can hear them
from the other room.

44:23.051 --> 44:25.706
My technology
lets me do that, too.

44:25.750 --> 44:27.186
I don't understand.

44:27.229 --> 44:30.493
Ravah remembers their mother
singing that song

44:30.537 --> 44:32.060
so many years ago.

44:32.104 --> 44:34.106
They are dying, Ohvahz.

44:34.149 --> 44:35.890
They don't want to die.

44:35.934 --> 44:37.675
[gasps]

44:37.718 --> 44:40.025
Are you a god?

44:40.068 --> 44:41.461
No, I am not.

44:41.504 --> 44:44.682
I am a person
from really far away.

44:44.725 --> 44:47.206
Almost as far away as those
who put the technology here.

44:47.249 --> 44:48.555
And I want to help you.

44:48.598 --> 44:51.340
I am here to help you
save your child

44:51.384 --> 44:54.866
and my friend from dying
a needless death.

44:54.909 --> 44:57.607
I-I don't know what to do.

44:57.651 --> 45:00.132
Ohvahz, I am not a god,

45:00.175 --> 45:02.047
but I don't know,
maybe I was sent here by one.

45:02.090 --> 45:04.614
Hear me when I tell you,

45:04.658 --> 45:07.661
the rains will come
whether or not Ravah dies.

45:07.705 --> 45:09.881
Trust me.

45:09.924 --> 45:12.057
Please let them live.

45:23.677 --> 45:25.592
[mechanical clicking]

45:26.636 --> 45:28.638
[wind gusting]

45:31.641 --> 45:34.253
[Burnham panting]

45:34.296 --> 45:35.341
Tilly?

45:36.124 --> 45:37.778
-Tilly?
-Ravah?

45:37.822 --> 45:39.519
[weakly]:
They're not breathing.

45:39.562 --> 45:40.912
Please, Ravah.
They're not breathing!

45:40.955 --> 45:42.261
[metallic trilling]

45:42.304 --> 45:44.524
BURNHAM:
Here. My team can save them.

45:45.307 --> 45:46.744
My team can save Ravah.

45:46.787 --> 45:49.181
They can save them.
Come on, let them work.

45:58.668 --> 46:00.845
â™ª

46:05.153 --> 46:07.503
OHVAHZ:
This...

46:07.547 --> 46:09.810
-this is Halem'no?
-BURNHAM: This is
what it looks like

46:09.854 --> 46:11.377
from our ship.

46:14.206 --> 46:19.820
It's... more beautiful
than I could have imagined.

46:42.756 --> 46:47.021
You said that an alien race
gave us the High Summit

46:47.065 --> 46:50.416
to save us from the dust storms.

46:50.459 --> 46:51.896
Why?

46:51.939 --> 46:53.680
The Denobulans,

46:53.723 --> 46:57.075
they value one another greatly,
just as you do here.

46:57.118 --> 46:59.468
They come from a world, uh,
much like your own.

46:59.512 --> 47:00.905
Massive storms.

47:00.948 --> 47:04.865
And they built weather towers
to keep them at bay.

47:04.909 --> 47:07.520
I suppose, in their travels,

47:07.563 --> 47:11.524
they felt a connection to you
and wanted to help.

47:12.481 --> 47:17.573
You should know
that the tower, the...

47:17.617 --> 47:20.968
the High Summit, is failing.

47:21.012 --> 47:22.883
We fixed it for now,

47:22.927 --> 47:24.537
but it will stop
working eventually

47:24.580 --> 47:26.887
if it isn't maintained.

47:26.931 --> 47:29.107
We can show you how.

47:30.195 --> 47:33.546
Thank you, but
does all this mean...

47:34.852 --> 47:37.245
Are there no gods?

47:38.768 --> 47:40.945
Are there...

47:40.988 --> 47:42.990
What is there?

47:43.034 --> 47:45.384
There is still what you believe.

47:45.427 --> 47:50.041
Nothing we have shown you
means gods don't exist.

47:50.084 --> 47:52.478
Or that the Journey of the
Mother Compeer didn't happen.

47:52.521 --> 47:57.309
It's just that now you know
that there is also us.

48:00.442 --> 48:02.836
What do I say to my people?

48:02.880 --> 48:05.665
The sacrifices unite us.

48:05.708 --> 48:09.321
They help us see
our common purpose.

48:09.364 --> 48:11.540
I fear how my people will react

48:11.584 --> 48:13.673
if we take this away
so suddenly.

48:13.716 --> 48:16.197
In the past,
attempts to stop the sacrifices

48:16.241 --> 48:19.984
have been met with
violence and upheaval.

48:20.027 --> 48:22.247
You are wise to consider that.

48:22.290 --> 48:24.989
But there are those among you
who seem ready

48:25.032 --> 48:27.295
to move beyond the sacrifices.

48:27.339 --> 48:29.994
The woman you healed. Anorah.

48:30.037 --> 48:33.388
She finds order in your people's

48:33.432 --> 48:35.347
commitment to one another.

48:35.390 --> 48:37.784
She told me the sacrifices
aren't necessary

48:37.827 --> 48:39.568
to bring one closer to the gods.

48:39.612 --> 48:42.180
Maybe others are ready
to understand that, too.

48:42.223 --> 48:44.965
Beliefs can evolve.

48:45.009 --> 48:49.448
Denying that can cause almost as
much chaos as the worst storm.

48:51.929 --> 48:53.669
Ravah will wake soon.

48:53.713 --> 48:56.150
And given the circumstances,
I believe they should see

48:56.194 --> 48:58.413
their father when they do.

49:10.208 --> 49:12.210
-Did we do a good thing?
-Mm...

49:12.253 --> 49:13.820
And you're alive.
That's a really good thing.

49:13.863 --> 49:16.170
You know how much paperwork
I'd have to fill out

49:16.214 --> 49:18.346
for losing a perfectly good
Starfleet officer?

49:18.390 --> 49:20.305
In addition to the paperwork
you're already gonna

49:20.348 --> 49:22.960
have to fill out for breaking
the Prime Directive, so...

49:23.003 --> 49:24.918
Oh, gosh. Okay.

49:24.962 --> 49:28.139
I'm about to make you
even happier that you saved me.

49:28.182 --> 49:29.705
Any of this look familiar?

49:29.749 --> 49:31.403
Perhaps you recognize this

49:31.446 --> 49:35.407
from a certain vial containing
a drop of pure distilled water?

49:35.450 --> 49:37.757
BURNHAM:
Yes. The scratches on the side.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.280
What are these?

49:39.324 --> 49:41.065
They're numbers
in ancient Halem'nese.

49:41.108 --> 49:43.023
One for each of the five towers.

49:43.067 --> 49:44.894
We are in the third tower.

49:45.678 --> 49:48.159
[gasps]
The vial had the same mark,

49:48.202 --> 49:50.900
so the clue is in tower five.

49:50.944 --> 49:53.381
-[laughs]
-RAVAH: Father?

49:55.122 --> 49:57.603
Are you with the gods as well?

49:57.646 --> 49:59.953
No, my child.

49:59.997 --> 50:02.042
We defied them?

50:02.086 --> 50:04.001
-No.
-The rains won't come.

50:04.044 --> 50:05.306
Listen.

50:05.350 --> 50:08.701
Perhaps devotion means...

50:08.744 --> 50:13.401
being able to hear when the gods
tell us something new.

50:14.228 --> 50:16.752
I'm very proud of you, Ravah.

50:17.840 --> 50:19.625
You're so full of light,

50:19.668 --> 50:24.586
courage and song,
just like your mother.

50:29.504 --> 50:31.550
[sighs]

50:45.868 --> 50:48.436
[thunder rumbling]

50:48.480 --> 50:51.787
The rains. They've come.

50:51.831 --> 50:53.789
[rain falling]

50:53.833 --> 50:55.530
[Ravah chuckling]

51:10.241 --> 51:12.069
â™ª

51:33.655 --> 51:36.136
-[sound of weapons firing]
-BOOK: Oh, cheeky, aren't we?

51:37.659 --> 51:39.661
Hmm, watch it now.

51:42.664 --> 51:45.102
CULBER:
Zora said you were here.

51:45.928 --> 51:48.409
And I see
you found a distraction.

51:48.453 --> 51:49.541
BOOK:
Next best thing.

51:49.584 --> 51:52.283
Why not the holodeck simulator?

51:52.326 --> 51:54.546
I can always tell
it's not a real ship.

51:54.589 --> 51:56.722
-You brought food?
-I thought you'd be hungry.

51:56.765 --> 52:00.856
My grandmother's
mofongo con pollo al ajillo.

52:00.900 --> 52:02.597
Replicator fresh.

52:07.472 --> 52:10.779
-Ah. Thank you.
-Welcome.

52:12.259 --> 52:14.218
BOOK:
Smells amazing.

52:18.135 --> 52:19.571
Mmm.

52:19.614 --> 52:22.487
-Mmm.
-CULBER: So, you
asked me earlier

52:22.530 --> 52:26.230
if I get tired
of having all the answers.

52:26.273 --> 52:30.756
-I meant it as a joke.
-I know, it's just...

52:30.799 --> 52:32.801
I don't, is the thing.

52:34.281 --> 52:37.545
-What's going on?
-I'm having a, uh...

52:38.372 --> 52:40.722
...spiritual awakening.

52:43.508 --> 52:47.120
Or maybe I'm just seeing a truth
I've always known, but...

52:47.164 --> 52:50.428
Ever since zhian'tara,

52:50.471 --> 52:52.604
nothing else explains it.

52:54.258 --> 52:56.260
It sounds kind of wonderful.

52:59.828 --> 53:01.221
I told Paul.

53:02.831 --> 53:05.443
I don't think
he really understood.

53:05.486 --> 53:07.532
I don't know that he ever will.

53:08.533 --> 53:09.708
So?

53:09.751 --> 53:12.450
Well, he's my partner.

53:12.493 --> 53:15.279
It's an odd quirk, really,

53:15.322 --> 53:19.326
this human tendency to consider
something less meaningful

53:19.370 --> 53:21.502
if it's just for yourself.

53:25.027 --> 53:27.465
I remember Michael
dealing with it,

53:27.508 --> 53:30.511
even though, deep down,
that feeling of being alone

53:30.555 --> 53:33.732
was the oldest and closest
friend she ever had.

53:36.778 --> 53:40.347
But still, you know,
it's what made me love her.

53:42.131 --> 53:43.742
You miss her.

53:45.700 --> 53:47.876
I see her every day.

53:47.920 --> 53:49.704
But you miss what you had.

53:51.445 --> 53:53.708
You think you can get it back?

53:57.538 --> 54:00.193
One answer at a time, Doc.

54:13.554 --> 54:15.513
BURNHAM:
Courtesy of tower number five.

54:15.556 --> 54:17.732
[Burnham and Tilly chuckle]

54:18.559 --> 54:20.213
It had a metal card attached

54:20.257 --> 54:22.433
with some kind of
Betazoid text inscription.

54:22.476 --> 54:25.740
Stamets is analyzing it
so we can see where to go next.

54:25.784 --> 54:28.395
What do you think Dr. Kreel
was trying to tell us,

54:28.439 --> 54:30.397
hiding the clue there?

54:30.441 --> 54:31.833
Well, he couldn't have known
that leaving behind

54:31.877 --> 54:33.313
a weather tower
would lead the Halem'nites

54:33.357 --> 54:35.359
to sacrificing one another.

54:35.402 --> 54:39.885
It is a massive
responsibility, technology.

54:39.928 --> 54:41.843
Maybe that's the real message.

54:42.844 --> 54:45.586
When we find
the Progenitors' creation...

54:47.458 --> 54:50.765
...we need to be so careful.

54:52.376 --> 54:55.161
-[comm chimes]
-CHRISTOPHER: Excuse me,
Captain?

54:55.204 --> 54:57.163
Go ahead,
Lieutenant Christopher.

54:57.206 --> 54:58.643
We just got a message
from Fed HQ.

54:58.686 --> 55:00.906
The USS Locherer
just found Moll and L'ak.

55:00.949 --> 55:02.647
Admiral Vance requests
that we jump

55:02.690 --> 55:04.388
to their location immediately.

55:04.431 --> 55:07.216
Okay, lock in coordinates.

55:07.260 --> 55:09.480
-Let's not make them wait.
-TILLY: Mm-mm.

55:23.407 --> 55:27.149
