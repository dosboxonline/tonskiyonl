Okay, we haven't yet found clues
from Dr. Derex or Dr. Kreel.

07:24.356 --> 07:25.401
For the vial,

07:25.445 --> 07:27.011
I'm betting on Kreel.

07:27.055 --> 07:29.361
His specialty was designing
weather modification towers

07:29.405 --> 07:30.580
to generate rain.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.364
So, we're going to Denobula.

07:32.408 --> 07:35.498
Maybe not. Um, Zora,

07:35.542 --> 07:37.021
can you confirm,

07:37.065 --> 07:40.068
Denobulan weather towers

07:40.111 --> 07:43.158
-with silver iodide, right?
-ZORA: Yes, Commander.

07:43.201 --> 07:44.899
That is typical
of their function

07:44.942 --> 07:46.291
both at present and during

07:46.335 --> 07:47.554
Dr. Kreel's time.

07:47.597 --> 07:49.033
All right, so then the water

07:49.077 --> 07:51.732
would be filled
with contaminants,

07:51.775 --> 07:54.038
but it's ultra-distilled.

07:54.082 --> 07:55.779
Well, Kreel's file
also mentioned

07:55.823 --> 07:58.739
he did work in weather
technology for other worlds.

07:59.957 --> 08:01.481
If a planet were arid enough...

08:01.524 --> 08:03.700
Then water would have to be
extracted from the air

08:03.744 --> 08:05.049
at the molecular level,

08:05.093 --> 08:07.530
which would mean
no contaminants whatsoever.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.924
Zora, how many M-Class planets

08:09.967 --> 08:12.143
were on Denobulan trade routes
when this vial was created?

08:12.187 --> 08:13.449
15.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.798
And how many of them
were dry enough

08:14.842 --> 08:16.844
that water would need
to be harvested

08:16.887 --> 08:18.410
in that particular way?

08:18.454 --> 08:20.238
Only one, Captain.

08:20.282 --> 08:22.240

-Halem'no.

08:22.284 --> 08:23.590
Whew.

08:26.810 --> 08:28.943
BURNHAM:
The planet Halem'no.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.859
Long-range scans show
a functioning weather tower

08:31.902 --> 08:33.730
of Denobulan design.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.950
It manufactures rain,

08:35.993 --> 08:37.952
and it emits
a low-grade forcefield

08:37.995 --> 08:40.432
that shields the planet's
only habitable region

08:40.476 --> 08:41.738
from dust storms.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.566
We've been able to confirm
that Dr. Kreel

08:43.610 --> 08:45.263
designed the tower,
so we believe

08:45.307 --> 08:47.396
the next clue is inside of it.

08:47.439 --> 08:49.703
Why would he make a weather
tower look like a mountain?

08:49.746 --> 08:51.052
That's a good question.

08:51.095 --> 08:54.098
Ensign Tal,

Uh, d-definitely pre-warp

Uh, there's no functioning

09:04.152 --> 09:05.545
electrical grid,

09:05.588 --> 09:07.938
and geological surveys show

09:07.982 --> 09:09.984
that the storms
on the planet have gotten

09:10.027 --> 09:13.422
increasingly more severe
over time, so...

09:13.465 --> 09:15.685
maybe Dr. Kreel
installed the tower

09:15.729 --> 09:17.600
as a humanitarian mission

09:17.644 --> 09:20.777
and hid it so not to violate
the Prime Directive?

09:20.821 --> 09:23.867
Makes sense. It's good to
see you on the bridge, Ensign.

09:23.911 --> 09:27.218
They requested more time up
here. I felt they were ready.

09:27.262 --> 09:29.307

Didn't necessarily mean today.

09:29.351 --> 09:31.005
No time like the present.

09:31.048 --> 09:32.441

Okay, so

09:32.484 --> 09:35.052
the Prime Directive will be
a concern for us, too.

the clue inside of that thing?

09:40.405 --> 09:44.322
No, there is an unusual energy
field surrounding the tower.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.526
We could really use you
at the Starfleet Academy.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.267
Well, don't tempt me.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.574
How is it going over there,
by the way?

13:12.617 --> 13:15.272
RAYNER [over comm]:
Captain, we've loaded
subcutaneous comms

13:15.316 --> 13:17.187
into the transport system.

13:17.231 --> 13:18.710
Ensign Tal's also been
playing with Starfleet's

13:18.754 --> 13:20.364
latest retinal tricorder mod.

13:20.408 --> 13:21.844
Should come in handy
if you need to be discreet.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.367
Thank you, Commander.

13:23.411 --> 13:26.718
We're good to go. Take us down.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.904
Let's activate
retinal tricorders.

13:39.514 --> 13:42.691
Think Dr. Kreel could have
picked a more gigantic place

13:42.734 --> 13:44.824
to hide the clue?

13:44.867 --> 13:47.827
Guess that's why the Halem'nites
call it the High Summit.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.612
Must have known
it'd be well-protected,

13:50.655 --> 13:53.615
since they believe they can
commune with their gods there.

13:58.141 --> 14:00.056
So, do you want
to talk about it?

14:00.100 --> 14:02.015
-TILLY: Hmm?
-BURNHAM: The Academy?

14:02.058 --> 14:03.277
TILLY:
Oh, yeah.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.757
I just got a message
from my student today.

14:05.801 --> 14:08.325
Cadet Ross, she actually
served us drinks at

14:08.369 --> 14:10.545
-the Millennium Celebration.
-Yeah. Earnest, big smile?

14:10.588 --> 14:12.677
Yes. She's thinking
about leaving the Academy

14:12.721 --> 14:14.288
to take a position
on a cargo vessel,

14:14.331 --> 14:17.117
and she wants to know
if I think she should do it.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.640
Mm.

14:18.683 --> 14:20.903
-So what are you gonna say?
-I know.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.818
Stay? Don't go?
I don't know, and...

14:22.862 --> 14:25.908
She wants to leave at all,
and she's not the first.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.475
We're not giving the cadets
what they need.

14:27.518 --> 14:28.780
I don't know
what the problem is.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.347
[whistling in distance]

14:30.391 --> 14:32.001
TILLY:
The whistle-speak.

14:32.045 --> 14:34.612
BURNHAM:
The universal translator's
got it.

14:34.656 --> 14:37.267
GROUP:
We've come here from afar.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.487
LONE VOICE:
Let my voice call you home.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.271
[whistling]

14:41.315 --> 14:43.839
GROUP:
We traveled from the dust.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.147
LONE VOICE:
Come rest, you must.

14:48.322 --> 14:50.977
GROUP:
We journeyed from the storms.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.980
LONE VOICE:
In the summit, you'll be warm.

14:54.023 --> 14:56.852
Sounds like they're going
where we're going.

15:00.987 --> 15:03.946
Hey. There you are.
Got a minute?

15:03.990 --> 15:06.253
Yeah. Heading to Engineering.
How can I help?

15:06.296 --> 15:07.907
I wondered if you could
put me in touch

15:07.950 --> 15:09.430
with the ship's counselor
on the Locherer.

15:09.473 --> 15:11.562
When they find Moll and L'ak,
I want them to have

15:11.606 --> 15:12.955
a full background
and know they can use me

15:12.999 --> 15:14.348
as a resource for anything.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.653
I'm sure they've been briefed.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.307
-It's not the same.
-Book,

15:17.351 --> 15:19.788
you need to accept that there's
nothing for you to do right now.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.659
I can't just sit
on my hands, Hugh.

15:21.703 --> 15:23.139
So find something
to distract you.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.576
What's occupied your brain
in the past?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.143
Focus on that.

15:27.187 --> 15:29.667
Recharge yourself so that you're
ready when you are needed.

15:29.711 --> 15:33.149
You ever get tired
of having all the answers?

15:33.193 --> 15:35.630
I'll check in with you later.
[chuckles]

15:38.720 --> 15:42.158
Paul, I need your help
with something.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.551
Can I pull you away?

15:43.594 --> 15:45.683
I'm looking to do a full
neural scan on myself,

15:45.727 --> 15:47.685
and I could use an assistant.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.383
A neural scan?

15:49.426 --> 15:50.775
Is everything all right?

15:50.819 --> 15:52.342
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
everything's fine.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.778
We don't have a lot of data

15:53.822 --> 15:55.998
on the neurological aftereffects
of zhian'tara,

15:56.042 --> 15:58.827
-and this is a chance
to gather some.
-Are you

15:58.870 --> 16:01.656
-having aftereffects?
-No, no.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.528
-Maybe.
-Hugh,

16:04.572 --> 16:06.791
-are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah, of course.

16:06.835 --> 16:09.142
We need this data, and, uh,

16:09.185 --> 16:12.623
well, when was the last time
you and I got to work together?

16:12.667 --> 16:14.843
-Might be nice.
-Nothing as romantic

16:14.886 --> 16:17.019
-as a neural scan.
-[laughs]

16:17.063 --> 16:19.108
So, is that a yes?

16:19.152 --> 16:20.588
At your service.

16:20.631 --> 16:22.894
Great. I will, uh,
prep everything,

16:22.938 --> 16:24.200
and we can start in the morning.

16:30.424 --> 16:32.643
[whistling]

16:36.996 --> 16:40.260
Hello. Hello.

16:40.303 --> 16:42.523
Greetings, compeers.

16:42.566 --> 16:45.221
We heard your call.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.397
Sounds like you're headed
to the High Summit.

16:47.441 --> 16:51.619
Yes, we've been following the
beacon voice since the moonrise.

16:51.662 --> 16:54.578
We g-got lost. May we join you?

16:54.622 --> 16:57.407
Of course. We are nearly there.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.192
[coughing]

17:04.414 --> 17:07.635
[grunts] Apologies.

17:08.679 --> 17:10.942
I was clearing dust
from an orchard

17:10.986 --> 17:14.511
and lost my way
in the Dry Lands.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.777
The Dry Lands.

17:19.820 --> 17:21.779
Were you out there very long?

17:21.823 --> 17:24.217
I breathed dust
for an entire night

17:24.260 --> 17:27.307
before the sun rose
and my compeers could rescue me.

17:27.349 --> 17:29.483
-Sounds frightening.
-[coughs]

17:29.526 --> 17:30.745
I suppose it is why

17:30.788 --> 17:32.790
they encourage elders

17:32.834 --> 17:35.967
not to take turns at
the edge of the storms.

17:36.011 --> 17:39.101
[wheezing] But i-if
I did not clear the dust,

17:39.145 --> 17:41.843
another would need
to take my place.

17:42.887 --> 17:45.455
-Where are you coming from?
-Uh...

17:45.499 --> 17:47.283
we came to worship
at the High Summit.

17:47.327 --> 17:50.591
Ah, you wish to pray for rain.

17:50.634 --> 17:54.160
We have been without it
for too long.

17:54.203 --> 17:57.250
Do any of the compeers go
inside the summit to pray?

17:57.293 --> 18:00.122
Only the chosen devout
may enter the temple.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.646
-Surely you know that.
-Of course,

18:02.690 --> 18:04.648
but... being from

18:04.692 --> 18:07.303
the east, the distance is far.

18:07.347 --> 18:08.783
Bless you, dear child,

18:08.826 --> 18:11.307
you've never seen
the High Summit before.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.135
No, no, we never have.

18:13.179 --> 18:16.399
But for years
we have longed to visit.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.140
[chuckles weakly]

18:18.184 --> 18:19.533
The day is here.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.839

RAVAH:
Compeers, you've arrived.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.148
I'm Ravah.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.324
It's my voice
that's been beckoning you home.

18:28.368 --> 18:31.066
Please come with me.
I have water and food ahead.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.372
[Anorah wheezing]

The Healing Grove, quickly.

18:38.552 --> 18:40.684

18:46.342 --> 18:49.084
Her medicine.
I saw her inhaling it

18:49.128 --> 18:50.390
-when we were walking.
-Maybe it's in her pack.

18:50.433 --> 18:53.741
[coughing]

18:55.046 --> 18:57.092
[sighs] Her lungs
are full of dust.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.877
A sonic percussion wave
would easily dislodge this.

18:59.921 --> 19:01.618
She doesn't
have to die from this.

19:01.662 --> 19:03.403
We can't break
the Prime Directive.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.231
No, I know, I know, I know.

19:06.057 --> 19:08.016
They're not finding
her medicine.

19:08.059 --> 19:10.018
Okay. Help me get her
on her side.

19:14.022 --> 19:15.763
RAVAH:
There they are, Father.

19:15.806 --> 19:18.069
Do not stop, compeer.
You're keeping her alive.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.246

You must forgive me.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.006
I did not have time to warn you

20:25.049 --> 20:27.226
of the intensity
of the sound cure.

20:27.269 --> 20:30.490
It's amazing that
you found a cure at all.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.187
Really impressive.

Hey, you're awake.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.147
[grunts]

20:36.191 --> 20:37.845
Ravah here's been telling me

20:37.888 --> 20:39.586
all about the High Summit.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.501
RAVAH:
I, too, was born far away.

20:41.544 --> 20:43.285
My father brought me here
after my mother died

20:43.329 --> 20:45.026
and he became priest
of the summit.

20:45.069 --> 20:46.506
OHVAHZ:
Let her regain
her strength, Ravah.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.116
RAVAH:
But they were
on the front lines.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.204
When my turn comes,
I'll clear that dust

20:49.248 --> 20:50.510
twice as fast as anyone else.

20:50.553 --> 20:51.946
OHVAHZ:
Ravah,

20:51.989 --> 20:53.861
the most important thing
is to work in harmony

20:53.904 --> 20:55.471
with the rest of your compeers.

20:55.515 --> 20:57.691
Of course you're right, Father.

20:57.734 --> 21:00.694
But it's clear
you're very strong.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.696
We're eager to enter
the High Summit,

21:02.739 --> 21:04.350
to give thanks to the gods.

21:04.393 --> 21:07.527
The gods do not require you to
enter the temple to give thanks.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.398
RAVAH:
But you could get in
if you wanted to.

21:09.442 --> 21:12.227
You just have to complete the
Journey of the Mother Compeer.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.795
-Ravah, please.
-Journey of the Mother Compeer?

21:14.838 --> 21:17.276
It's a race and a test
of devotion because

21:17.319 --> 21:19.060
it's quite grueling. Everyone
says that we're due because

21:19.103 --> 21:20.714
watching the race
makes the gods happy,

21:20.757 --> 21:22.542
and we've been
without rain for so long.

21:22.585 --> 21:25.458
Only the one who wins is worthy
of entering the temple.

21:25.501 --> 21:26.894
There, they're close to the gods

21:26.937 --> 21:28.374
and they can ask
for their blessing.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.114
OHVAHZ:
Let's discuss
another time, Ravah.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.855
Our compeers only just arrived.

21:31.899 --> 21:33.074
BURNHAM:
But we wish to show our devotion

21:33.117 --> 21:34.554
in whatever way we can.

21:34.597 --> 21:35.729
RAVAH:
And this is perfect.

21:35.772 --> 21:36.773
If you make the request,

21:36.817 --> 21:38.079
we could do it tomorrow morning.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.559
Isn't that right, Father?

21:39.602 --> 21:41.561
One just has to make the
request, that's how it works.

21:41.604 --> 21:42.562
Hmm.

21:42.605 --> 21:44.303
Then I make the request.

21:45.782 --> 21:49.003
Nothing's more important to us
than entering that summit.

Oh.

22:25.169 --> 22:26.954
Good morning, compeers.

22:26.997 --> 22:29.130
Are there any messages
you'd like me

22:29.173 --> 22:31.132
to bring to the gods
when I see them?

22:31.175 --> 22:32.612
-You're running today?
-Mm.

22:32.655 --> 22:35.919
You've inspired me,
as you've inspired the others.

22:35.963 --> 22:38.095
The difficulty
of the Journey is legendary.

Ravah,

22:41.577 --> 22:42.839
may I have a word?

22:42.883 --> 22:45.886
No, Father, I'm getting ready.

22:45.929 --> 22:49.019
You are too young
to take the Journey.

22:49.063 --> 22:51.805
I'm stronger
than you think I am.

22:52.893 --> 22:55.330
You're wearing that today?

22:57.680 --> 22:59.378
I wish for Mother
to watch over me.

23:01.554 --> 23:04.121
Ravah, I promised her that...

23:04.165 --> 23:05.645
You would keep me
a child forever?

23:05.688 --> 23:07.081
OHVAHZ:
No. That I would protect you.

23:07.124 --> 23:10.432
RAVAH:
I've grown, Father.

23:10.476 --> 23:12.303
I'm devoted. You must see that.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.784
HALEM'NITE:
Excuse me, compeer,
tradition demands we begin

23:14.828 --> 23:16.307
the preparations.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.614
As you wish.

23:25.229 --> 23:28.276
You know, I-I have a student,
um...

23:28.319 --> 23:30.452
back East.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.193
She reminds me a lot of you.

23:32.236 --> 23:35.283
She just wants to get out there
and do, as fast as she can.

23:35.326 --> 23:37.459
It can be hard to even...

23:37.503 --> 23:40.244
just as a teacher, to step back.

23:41.463 --> 23:44.858
I can only imagine what it
would be like as a parent.

23:44.901 --> 23:47.034
My father is a great man.

23:47.077 --> 23:50.211
And I want to show him
that I can be great, too.

23:50.254 --> 23:54.302
Compeer, uh,
may I have a moment?

24:00.569 --> 24:01.918
Ensign Tal chased down a hunch

24:01.962 --> 24:03.616
and found something interesting.

24:03.659 --> 24:06.445
Uh, I did
a historical regression

24:06.488 --> 24:08.098
of Halem'no's weather patterns,

24:08.142 --> 24:09.926
and the data indicated that

24:09.970 --> 24:12.015
there might have been other
weather towers in the past.

24:12.059 --> 24:13.408
RAYNER:
We sent down a team of DOTs

24:13.452 --> 24:14.888
into the dust storm
to check it out.

24:14.931 --> 24:18.065
-They found four more towers.
-Yeah.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.241
Over time, the others failed.

24:20.284 --> 24:23.070
Uh, their energy-distribution
matrices fell out of alignment,

24:23.113 --> 24:26.029
and that's the same thing that's
happening to the High Summit.

24:26.073 --> 24:27.901
That's what's causing the
energy field that's stopping us

24:27.944 --> 24:29.293
from beaming you inside
for the clue.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.991
BURNHAM:
Okay, what's the solve?

24:31.034 --> 24:33.254
All of the towers have
an auxiliary control panel

24:33.297 --> 24:34.516
hidden nearby.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.257
If you can find the one
near the High Summit,

24:36.300 --> 24:38.041
it should be easy enough
to reset any of the components

24:38.085 --> 24:39.478
that have failed over time.

24:39.521 --> 24:41.088
TILLY:
Adira, were there settlements

24:41.131 --> 24:42.524
around any of the other
weather towers?

24:42.568 --> 24:44.221
At all of them, in fact.

24:44.265 --> 24:46.006
They were destroyed
when the towers failed.

24:46.049 --> 24:48.922
So, if we don't fix this one,
everyone here will die.

24:48.965 --> 24:51.620
Thank you, Discovery.

24:51.664 --> 24:54.405
One mission just became two.

24:54.449 --> 24:57.931
Well, we've checked
for biological, chemical,

24:57.974 --> 25:00.673
and genetic anomalies, and, um,

25:00.716 --> 25:04.111
turns out you have
a perfectly typical,

25:04.154 --> 25:07.418
healthy and rather handsome

25:07.462 --> 25:08.637
human brain.

25:08.681 --> 25:11.945
So, no lasting
neurological effects

25:11.988 --> 25:14.208
of zhian'tara whatsoever?

25:14.251 --> 25:15.731
None.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.785
There's something
you're not saying.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.570
It's just, I was...

25:28.614 --> 25:30.485
hoping these scans would...

25:30.529 --> 25:32.618
give me an answer.

25:32.661 --> 25:36.796
You know, a physiological cause
for what I'm feeling, and...

25:36.839 --> 25:39.320
then I'd understand,
then I could talk about it.

25:39.363 --> 25:40.495
I don't understand.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.453
Are you feeling sick, or...?

25:42.497 --> 25:43.846
No. Uh...

25:43.890 --> 25:46.283
the opposite.

25:48.329 --> 25:51.071
Ever since Trill, I've...

25:51.114 --> 25:55.162
felt more connected,
more, um...

25:55.205 --> 25:56.903
attuned

25:56.946 --> 25:59.427
to something
greater than myself.

26:01.385 --> 26:03.170
Greater than all of us.

26:04.171 --> 26:07.914
But if there's no scientific
reason for it, then...

26:07.957 --> 26:11.308
So it's a... spiritual thing?

26:14.094 --> 26:16.400
Hey, what matters most
is that you're okay.

26:16.444 --> 26:18.359
The scans would have
picked up anything

26:18.402 --> 26:19.882
with health implications.

26:19.926 --> 26:22.798
So, in lieu of that, I say

26:22.842 --> 26:25.192
why don't you just enjoy it?

26:26.193 --> 26:27.237
Really?

26:28.195 --> 26:31.198
The human brain,
with its billions of neurons,

26:31.241 --> 26:33.679
each with thousands
of connection points,

26:33.722 --> 26:35.855
is one of the most
complex things

26:35.898 --> 26:36.943
in the known universe.

26:36.986 --> 26:39.467
[chuckles]:
So...

26:39.510 --> 26:42.122
enjoy it.

26:42.165 --> 26:43.384
Right. [chuckles]

26:50.043 --> 26:52.611
[indistinct conversation]

26:55.439 --> 26:59.661
BURNHAM:
The race is about to begin.
Are you not happy, compeer?

26:59.705 --> 27:01.620
Are you not enjoying today?

27:01.663 --> 27:05.232
I was thinking of the last time
there was a Journey.

27:05.275 --> 27:06.363
I ran.

27:06.407 --> 27:09.366
As did my friend Vohrahli.

27:09.410 --> 27:11.238
She was so fast.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.632
Of course she won.
[chuckles softly]

27:13.675 --> 27:15.895
It was long ago.

27:15.938 --> 27:18.027
I am thinking about Vohrahli

27:18.071 --> 27:21.378
and what we might look like
if we could be wrinkled,

27:21.422 --> 27:24.207
old elders together. [laughs]

27:24.251 --> 27:26.862
-You would look beautiful.
-[chuckles]

27:26.906 --> 27:30.692
You know, you need not go
to the High Summit

27:30.736 --> 27:32.259
to be with the gods.

27:32.302 --> 27:35.088
They are with us when
we do good for one another,

27:35.131 --> 27:37.438
when we love,
when we save each other,

27:37.481 --> 27:39.962
as you saved me.

27:40.006 --> 27:43.096
You don't need to run
to see them.

27:43.139 --> 27:44.532
I know, I...

27:44.575 --> 27:47.230
It's something that
I've dreamed of my whole life.

27:48.492 --> 27:50.538
I understand then,

27:50.581 --> 27:53.672
and I shall pray for you.

27:59.329 --> 28:01.680
Everything all right?

28:01.723 --> 28:03.072
I think so.

28:03.116 --> 28:05.031
OHVAHZ:
My good and blessed compeers,

28:05.074 --> 28:07.947
it is our great fortune
to bear witness

28:07.990 --> 28:11.080
to the Journey of the
Mother Compeer today.

28:11.124 --> 28:14.127
Legend tells us that,
in ancient times,

28:14.170 --> 28:16.956
all of Halem'no
was fertile and gentle,

28:16.999 --> 28:19.828
but even in such a land of
plenty, the Halem'nites warred

28:19.872 --> 28:22.657
against each other
and lost the favor of the gods.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.573
To punish us, they brought
the dust storms.

28:25.616 --> 28:27.967
We would have ended our days

28:28.010 --> 28:31.274
in thirst and dust
if the Great Mother Compeer

28:31.318 --> 28:33.712
hadn't shown the gods
our true selves.

28:33.755 --> 28:35.757
She ventured out into

28:35.801 --> 28:38.064
the storms and traveled far
to find water

28:38.107 --> 28:40.675
for her children.
As she journeyed back with it,

28:40.719 --> 28:42.459
her lungs filled with dust.

28:42.503 --> 28:44.505
-[coughing]
-OHVAHZ: Her thirst
was terrible,

28:44.548 --> 28:46.637
-and yet she didn't drink
a single drop.
-[others coughing]

28:46.681 --> 28:48.814
She reached her children
and gave them

28:48.857 --> 28:50.990
the life-giving water.
She saved them,

28:51.033 --> 28:53.688
then breathed her last.

28:53.732 --> 28:56.778
The gods were so moved
by her sacrifice,

28:56.822 --> 28:58.867
they brought back the rains.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.304
Today, as you journey around

29:01.348 --> 29:03.785
the High Summit
bearing a terrible thirst,

29:03.829 --> 29:05.656
you, too, will endure this test.

29:05.700 --> 29:08.964
May you remind the gods
of the Mother Compeer,

29:09.008 --> 29:12.098
of her devotion, our devotion,

29:12.141 --> 29:13.795
and earn their merciful rain.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.797
[grunting]

29:15.841 --> 29:17.407
[gasps, coughs]

29:17.451 --> 29:19.192
A courageous attempt, compeers,

29:19.235 --> 29:21.542
but you are now disqualified.

29:21.585 --> 29:22.891
Begin.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.458
Try not to fall behind.

29:24.501 --> 29:26.503
-[crowd cheering]
-We have to get that clue.

29:26.547 --> 29:29.115
[coughing]

29:42.737 --> 29:44.608
[panting]

29:57.404 --> 29:59.145
BURNHAM:
Just one minute.

29:59.188 --> 30:00.886
I just need a minute.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.757
[groans]

30:02.801 --> 30:05.978
[whispering]:
Body in motion remains
in motion.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.588
[Burnham groans]

30:07.631 --> 30:10.243
They've all got to get water
at some point, right?

30:10.286 --> 30:12.071
And we have endurance,
we have...

30:12.114 --> 30:13.376
Starfleet training.

30:13.420 --> 30:15.988
Yeah, keep telling
yourself that.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.554
Let's go.
We're gonna fall behind.

30:17.598 --> 30:20.166
-[panting]
-A body in motion...

30:20.209 --> 30:22.472
will remain in motion.

30:23.256 --> 30:26.433
[both panting]

30:28.478 --> 30:31.090
TILLY:
Body in motion stays in motion.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.744
Wait, wait, what's that?

30:33.788 --> 30:35.572
Body at rest. [whimpers]

30:35.616 --> 30:38.401
Look at the moss on the trees.

30:38.445 --> 30:39.968
Most of it's blue,
but some of it's yellow.

30:40.012 --> 30:42.579
That's a genetic mutation.

30:42.623 --> 30:44.451
If a control panel
were 800 years old,

30:44.494 --> 30:46.975
it would leak radiation, right?

30:47.019 --> 30:48.194
And if it is leaking radiation,

30:48.237 --> 30:51.153
it would be causing mutations.

30:51.980 --> 30:55.375
If I'm right, then this moss
would lead to a control panel.

30:55.418 --> 30:57.725
And if you're wrong?

30:57.768 --> 31:00.771
Then one of us still needs
to win this race

31:00.815 --> 31:02.599
and get that clue.

31:02.643 --> 31:03.513
Go.

31:03.557 --> 31:06.081
-Really?
-Go chase your moss.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.692
I'm the queen of endurance.

31:08.736 --> 31:11.913
-Body in motion...
-Remains in motion.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.829
[gasping]

31:14.873 --> 31:17.701
I'm out.

31:17.745 --> 31:19.442
[grunts]

31:30.976 --> 31:33.587
[panting]

31:46.339 --> 31:47.601
-[sighs]
-No.

31:47.644 --> 31:50.430
No, don't give up now, compeer.

31:50.473 --> 31:52.214
It's just the two of us left,

31:52.258 --> 31:53.650
and I want some
real competition.

31:53.694 --> 31:55.435
You're a little shit,
you know that?

31:55.478 --> 31:57.176
I can't hear you,
I'm too far ahead.

31:57.219 --> 31:58.960
Don't think
I'm not gonna beat you.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.483
Okay?

32:00.527 --> 32:02.355
Get over here. Come here.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.598
[tricorder trilling]

32:36.780 --> 32:39.000
Discovery,I've found
the tower control panel.

32:39.044 --> 32:41.785
Scanning it now.

32:45.572 --> 32:48.923
[sighs] This tech requires
periodic maintenance.

32:48.967 --> 32:51.056
Without that, it was bound
to fail eventually.

32:51.099 --> 32:53.667
BURNHAM:
So how do I fix it?

32:55.364 --> 32:58.628
Uh, you'll need to rebuild
the motherboard,

32:58.672 --> 33:00.891
uh, without shutting it down
by accident.

33:00.935 --> 33:03.459
No pressure. Tell me what to do.

33:03.503 --> 33:07.028
Uh, do you see a small red chip

33:07.072 --> 33:08.508
on the far left-hand side?

33:08.551 --> 33:10.249
BURNHAM:
Yes. I see a lot of them.

33:10.292 --> 33:12.860
ADIRA:
Sorry, in the top left corner.

33:12.903 --> 33:16.429
We'll start by rerouting that
to the override system.

33:16.951 --> 33:19.432
RAVAH:
We're almost there.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.218
OHVAHZ:
Stop.

33:23.262 --> 33:26.395
Near the end of the
Mother Compeer's Journey,

33:26.439 --> 33:28.223
the gods tempted her to drink.

33:28.267 --> 33:29.964
So, our final two racers

33:30.008 --> 33:31.444
must now complete the Journey

33:31.487 --> 33:33.272
while carrying temptation.

33:44.761 --> 33:47.764
[muffled cheering]

33:51.420 --> 33:53.205
[crowd cheering, applause]

34:09.221 --> 34:11.527
RAVAH:
No!

34:11.571 --> 34:13.572
[murmuring]

34:15.661 --> 34:18.578
OHVAHZ:
Spilling your water
is a disqualification, Ravah.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.275
Please, child,

34:20.319 --> 34:22.147
come, slake your thirst.

34:23.016 --> 34:25.802
A racer cannot complete
the journey with an empty bowl.

34:25.846 --> 34:28.501
-It was a noble effort, Ravah.
-[cheering]

34:34.855 --> 34:36.335
Come, Ravah.

34:38.163 --> 34:39.989
Come.

34:40.034 --> 34:41.469
Ravah.

34:44.038 --> 34:47.694
I thought you were gonna
give me a little competition.

34:47.737 --> 34:49.696
It's over.

34:54.875 --> 34:56.833
TILLY:
Come on.

34:56.877 --> 34:58.705
Come on. Up.

34:58.748 --> 34:59.923
Come on.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.186
Up.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.930
Let's go meet the gods together.

35:06.974 --> 35:09.194
[crowd cheering, applauding]

35:22.816 --> 35:24.644
-[device chirps]
-BURNHAM: Okay, that wasn't it.

35:24.687 --> 35:26.950
I'm gonna try
another isolinear chip.

35:26.994 --> 35:29.997
Sir, maybe we should get
someone with more experience

35:30.040 --> 35:31.607
to help support the captain.

35:31.651 --> 35:34.175
You're the one who wanted
to be on the bridge.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.872
-I know, um, but...
-But nothing.

35:35.916 --> 35:38.048
I wouldn't have agreed if I
thought you couldn't handle it.

35:38.092 --> 35:39.224
You've been
second-guessing yourself

35:39.267 --> 35:40.834
since that time bug came
on board.

35:40.877 --> 35:42.575
That's not on you.

35:42.618 --> 35:44.316
Understood?

35:45.621 --> 35:48.363
BURNHAM:
Got it.
Okay, Ensign, what's next?

35:48.407 --> 35:52.150
Last step, right? Bring it home.

35:55.675 --> 35:56.806
Okay.

35:56.850 --> 35:59.244
Uh, Captain,
I need you to bypass

35:59.287 --> 36:01.202
the auxiliary power circuit.

36:01.246 --> 36:03.422
-Bypass?
-Yank it out, Captain.

36:06.294 --> 36:08.253
Come on, come on.

36:11.995 --> 36:13.475
We got lights.

36:13.519 --> 36:15.042
Yes.

36:15.085 --> 36:17.218
Okay, I will have you beaming
into the tower in no time.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.220
Nice work, Ensign.

36:20.221 --> 36:22.397
Tilly, we solved
the interference issue.

36:22.441 --> 36:24.878
-Where are you now?
-TILLY: I'm in the temple.

36:24.921 --> 36:26.053
You won the race?

36:26.096 --> 36:28.664
Ravah and I tied.
We're both here.

36:28.708 --> 36:30.927

If it's not thing,
it's another with this place.

Okay, it looks like
you're in the vacuum chamber.

38:02.715 --> 38:04.412

that center column

to make it rain.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.418
And seeing
that it's a vacuum chamber,

38:10.462 --> 38:12.159
I'm guessing that,
in the process,

38:12.202 --> 38:13.639
it sucks all the air
out of there.

Makes sense the room's
made of tritanium.

Oh, um, just
praying to the gods.

Okay, that has to be Ohvahz.

We have to wait
for him to leave.

And we will. We are not

maintain this technology,

And you're alive.
That's a really good thing.

you're already gonna

a drop of pure distilled water?

Yes. The scratches on the side.

49:37.800 --> 49:39.280

49:39.324 --> 49:41.065
They're numbers
