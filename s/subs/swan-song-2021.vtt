WEBVTT

00:41.917 --> 00:44.628
Let me guess. Latte, oat milk, no sugar.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.213
Spot on, sir.

00:46.797 --> 00:48.841
I'll take an Echo bar
if you've got any.

00:49.341 --> 00:51.552
Echo's my middle name. Will that be all?

00:51.635 --> 00:53.470
That's good, thank you.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.974
All right.
Payment taken. Order coming up.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.563
Thank you, bro.

01:02.646 --> 01:05.858
You're welcome, Cameron.
Okay, good talk. We'll see you tomorrow.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.486
<i>Step down from the train.</i>

01:18.078 --> 01:21.248
Look, I know my brother, all right?
He's very sensitive.

03:14.444 --> 03:15.445
Hello?

03:16.154 --> 03:18.740
Hey. Yeah.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.205
No. We're pulling into the station now.

03:25.289 --> 03:27.499
<i>This station is Summit Park.</i>

03:27.583 --> 03:29.793
I'll see you in a bit, okay? All right.

03:31.336 --> 03:32.379
Bye.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.340
It's all yours.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.557
<i>The train is now arriving at Summit Park.</i>

03:55.777 --> 03:58.322
<i>The next station is Stadium Avenue.</i>

04:07.623 --> 04:08.790
Oh, my God.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.293
Oh, fuck.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.421
Oh, no.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.718
Oh, shit.

04:20.802 --> 04:22.846
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

04:32.689 --> 04:33.690
Cameron.

05:08.267 --> 05:10.018
<i>Hi, Cameron. Dr. Scott here.</i>

05:10.102 --> 05:12.980
<i>Look, I don't wanna add
any more strain on you,</i>

05:13.063 --> 05:17.317
<i>but with your latest scan
showing an accelerating deterioration,</i>

05:17.401 --> 05:19.486
<i>it's vital that we keep moving forward
with--</i>

05:19.570 --> 05:20.571
Mute.

05:50.267 --> 05:53.270
Pig. You out here?

05:54.438 --> 05:55.898
Good boy, now.

05:58.567 --> 05:59.985
You guys save me some food?

06:01.862 --> 06:04.656
Yeah? You didn't eat all my food today?

06:51.245 --> 06:54.748
<i>Child prodigy or future serial killer?</i>

06:54.831 --> 06:56.625
<i>Can't wait for parent-teacher night.</i>

09:06.505 --> 09:11.093
Welcome to Arra House, Cameron.
Good to meet you in person.

09:12.970 --> 09:14.179
Come in.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.147
This is our main living area.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.234
Wow.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.085
I know that
some of these concepts are uncomfortable.

09:45.169 --> 09:48.463
Just remember that
if you decide not to proceed

09:48.547 --> 09:53.051
at any point in the evaluation process,
he never leaves this facility.

09:54.136 --> 09:57.848
And there's--
there's no way he gets this thing?

09:59.099 --> 10:04.104
As outlined, we modified
the relevant strands of his DNA

10:04.188 --> 10:06.023
to prevent that happening again.

10:10.777 --> 10:13.447
And what happens to him
if I decide not to do this? He just--

10:13.530 --> 10:17.951
He goes to sleep that night unaware.
Doesn't know a thing.

10:23.290 --> 10:27.377
We'll be calling him Jack for now,
if that name's okay with you.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.533
This is the control room.

10:59.201 --> 11:00.285
And this is Dalton.

11:00.786 --> 11:02.746
-Welcome, Cameron.
-Hello.

11:03.914 --> 11:06.708
He's a psychologist
and the head technician.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.461
And that completes our team.

11:10.629 --> 11:12.089
It's just three of you?

11:12.172 --> 11:16.343
Three humans. Our AI systems
do the work of about 50 people.

11:20.514 --> 11:22.558
Before we let you in,

11:23.308 --> 11:27.187
we'll need you to disable the cameras
in your contacts and your watch.

11:27.855 --> 11:29.106
Oh, okay.

11:33.110 --> 11:34.278
Disable cameras.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.114
Thank you.

11:38.615 --> 11:41.618
So, shall we go in?

12:15.611 --> 12:17.738
Molecularly regenerated.

12:18.947 --> 12:21.074
Mapped to your DNA.

12:22.284 --> 12:25.162
Cameron Turner to the molecule.

12:58.987 --> 12:59.988
Is he dreaming?

13:01.406 --> 13:02.491
Not yet.

13:15.838 --> 13:17.965
Go ahead. He can't wake.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.919
I'm sorry, Doctor.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.593
I can't do this.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.961
<i>I know
what a momentous decision this is for you.</i>

14:38.045 --> 14:40.547
<i>I know what you're going through.</i>

14:41.048 --> 14:42.049
<i>But justâ€¦</i>

14:43.217 --> 14:45.969
<i>the second you tell your wife
that you're dying,</i>

14:46.053 --> 14:48.555
<i>your opportunity to do this is gone.</i>

14:50.057 --> 14:51.183
<i>You can tell her,</i>

14:51.266 --> 14:55.270
<i>or you can do this with us
and let life go on for your family.</i>

14:56.271 --> 15:00.108
<i>But given your worsening condition,
we can't afford to delay, Cameron.</i>

15:00.943 --> 15:03.028
<i>Please call me.</i>

15:12.371 --> 15:13.372
A surf scoter.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.290
Excellent. And this one?

15:16.625 --> 15:17.626
Cory?

15:18.585 --> 15:21.922
Hooded mergant.

15:26.385 --> 15:27.845
No.

15:59.668 --> 16:01.003
Can I have your pencils?

16:01.587 --> 16:03.589
You eyeing my pencils now?

16:05.883 --> 16:09.761
The same set I've had for 22 years.
You're eyeing my pencils?

16:09.845 --> 16:11.054
You ain't using 'em.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.265
"Ain't"? When did we start saying "ain't"?

16:13.348 --> 16:16.351
You don't use 'em since Andre died.

16:27.362 --> 16:29.948
<i>Cam, what's with you lately?</i>

16:30.032 --> 16:33.285
<i>Look, I know you're an artist
and this is painful for you. I get it.</i>

16:34.036 --> 16:36.079
<i>But this is a health-focused organic tea.</i>

16:36.163 --> 16:38.957
<i>It's not some fucking ayahuasca brew
we're designing.</i>

16:39.917 --> 16:43.045
<i>When you follow along with what
the client wants, you kill it, you know?</i>

16:43.128 --> 16:45.380
<i>So just play ball. Okay?</i>

16:45.464 --> 16:47.382
-All right.
-<i>Love ya. Bye.</i>

16:56.016 --> 16:58.352
You want one of these?

17:22.835 --> 17:26.547
-<i>Uncle Andre.</i>
-<i>Cory, can you say "Uncle Andre"?</i>

17:32.427 --> 17:33.762
That is cloning, by the way.

17:33.846 --> 17:35.889
-No!
-Yeah.

17:35.973 --> 17:38.517
No, technically speaking, it's not.
The article said it's not.

17:38.600 --> 17:41.562
It's-- It's regeneration.

17:41.645 --> 17:45.148
It doesn't matter what you call it, Andre.
It's still weird.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.943
I don't care
how good they say the tech's gonna be.

17:48.026 --> 17:49.945
You'd know
it wasn't a real person in seconds.

17:50.028 --> 17:52.865
Look, I'm just saying,
hypothetically speaking,

17:52.948 --> 17:56.994
what if it was actually possible?
What if they did actually work it out?

17:59.288 --> 18:03.125
They won't, Andre. 'Cause you can't
copy a human being. You can't.

18:04.835 --> 18:08.255
-Cameron?
-No. I-- No, I'm staying way out of this.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.339
Oh, come on.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.886
Nothing like a good death chat
first thing in the morning.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.971
Okay.

18:16.054 --> 18:18.974
-Is that funny?
-Right? It's ridiculous. Come on.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.060
Look, if Mom could be sitting here
right now with us,

18:22.144 --> 18:27.232
and, like, you know, we couldn't tell,
she was indistinguishable, then yeah.

18:28.025 --> 18:31.069
You know, screw the ethics.
I would take that.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.573
I mean, that being said,

18:34.656 --> 18:37.701
if they happen to delete
her fondness for yacht rock,

18:37.784 --> 18:39.620
-I would not be devastated.
-Yes.

18:39.703 --> 18:42.164
Going crazy.
Gimme the lips, Poppy. Gimme the lips.

18:42.247 --> 18:43.874
There it is.

18:44.458 --> 18:45.459
Yes.

19:09.942 --> 19:14.112
I know how you're feeling,
but there is no lie.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.740
When the memory of this process
gets wiped,

19:16.823 --> 19:21.495
he wakes up that day at home
as Cameron Turner.

19:21.578 --> 19:24.831
And no one knows. Not even him.

19:25.707 --> 19:28.877
It's the only way this works.
A clean swap.

19:30.003 --> 19:33.632
How many others are out there?
I wanna know.

19:36.718 --> 19:38.178
You'll be our third.

19:41.723 --> 19:45.143
This will be as common
as a heart transplant within a few years.

19:47.145 --> 19:51.900
Come back and spend a week with him
before making your decision.

19:54.611 --> 19:57.906
This is not just my decision.
My wife needs to know.

19:57.990 --> 20:03.412
Either you decide that your wife would
want this, which requires secrecy,

20:03.495 --> 20:07.666
or you decide that she wouldn't,
and tell her you're dying.

20:09.084 --> 20:13.463
Either way, you're deciding for her.

20:18.594 --> 20:23.348
Listen, the woman you're about to meet
has no idea she's a duplicate.

20:24.600 --> 20:28.061
<i>Neither does her daughter,
her mother, or her friends.</i>

20:29.646 --> 20:31.565
<i>So, where is the lie?</i>

20:47.122 --> 20:51.460
Oh, hey, there. Mr. Turner, right?

20:52.586 --> 20:53.712
Yeah, uh, Cameron.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.506
Browsing for a three-bed
in the neighborhood?

20:55.589 --> 20:56.840
Oh, yeah.

20:59.259 --> 21:02.721
This is, uh, my boss, Samantha.

21:03.764 --> 21:04.973
I'm her daughter.

21:05.849 --> 21:07.017
Daughter.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.101
She runs a tight ship.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.938
Anyway, have a seat.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.524
I had some good ones
come in today, actually.

21:15.859 --> 21:18.070
You said in your message
you had a son, right?

21:18.654 --> 21:20.322
Yeah. Cory.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.157
He runs the show as well?

21:23.033 --> 21:24.868
Yeah. The smaller, the bossier.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.996
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:23.677 --> 22:24.678
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:27.306 --> 22:29.224
Cory at Jessie's for dinner?

22:29.725 --> 22:32.060
Yeah. He's back at 8:00.

22:33.645 --> 22:35.230
-You taking a break?
-Yeah.

22:58.086 --> 23:01.173
So I think we're gonna get Dr. Herbert
for the ultrasound.

23:02.341 --> 23:05.552
I'm just waiting for them to confirm,
but it's looking good.

23:05.636 --> 23:06.720
Yeah.

23:08.472 --> 23:10.015
That's good. We like Herbert.

23:14.019 --> 23:16.522
Are you bracing yourself
for sexy bowling ball bod?

23:24.863 --> 23:26.532
I still can't believe it.

23:27.241 --> 23:29.952
We're gonna fall in love
with a new little person again.

23:31.245 --> 23:32.496
Seven months.

23:40.379 --> 23:41.421
What's up, Cam?

23:48.470 --> 23:50.389
I'm good. It's just, umâ€¦

23:57.396 --> 23:58.522
It's just, umâ€¦

24:04.194 --> 24:05.654
So, we, umâ€¦

24:07.948 --> 24:08.991
Cameron?

24:17.833 --> 24:20.335
It's just, a new little person. Andâ€¦

24:21.712 --> 24:24.214
I think that's just sinking in still,
you know.

24:26.049 --> 24:28.218
Oh, bear.

24:28.886 --> 24:31.388
Cam.

24:34.766 --> 24:35.767
Cam.

24:36.810 --> 24:38.729
I know it took me a minute,

24:39.897 --> 24:42.733
and I know we haven't been us for a while,

24:43.525 --> 24:46.111
but this baby is going to be good for us.

24:46.987 --> 24:48.030
Yeah.

24:50.991 --> 24:54.077
We're gonna be okay. All right?

25:08.008 --> 25:09.009
Cory.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.147
<i>Cameron?</i>

25:22.773 --> 25:24.358
I've changed my mind.

25:51.844 --> 25:52.928
Mind if I sit?

26:01.854 --> 26:04.731
Hi. I'm Cameron.

26:05.899 --> 26:06.900
Kate.

26:11.238 --> 26:12.447
So, you met her?

26:13.991 --> 26:14.992
Yesterday.

26:17.286 --> 26:18.453
How's she doing?

26:19.830 --> 26:21.790
Good. I guess.

26:21.874 --> 26:23.500
She try to sell you a house?

26:24.334 --> 26:25.711
Condo.

26:27.754 --> 26:28.839
It's what we do.

26:35.554 --> 26:36.555
<i>A week?</i>

26:37.139 --> 26:40.559
<i>And the clients just spring this on you
today, zero notice?</i>

26:41.643 --> 26:42.978
<i>What's going on, Cam?</i>

26:43.562 --> 26:44.563
Nothing.

26:45.647 --> 26:49.234
The designer they had got sick last minute
and they needed someone here in person.

26:49.318 --> 26:51.862
Look, I'm sorry, P. I am.

26:51.945 --> 26:55.073
I wish I didn't have to be away right now.
Believe me.

26:57.367 --> 27:00.204
<i>All right. Well, I'd better get back here.</i>

27:00.913 --> 27:02.873
-<i>I'll speak to you later, yeah?</i>
-All right.

27:18.222 --> 27:20.057
Okay, Cameron.

27:20.849 --> 27:24.853
You'll be out for the entire process.
It'll take about six hours.

27:25.479 --> 27:27.314
Okay. He'll have everything?

27:27.856 --> 27:29.191
Every single memory

27:29.274 --> 27:32.194
right up to the moment
you lose consciousness in that chair.

27:43.664 --> 27:46.416
In a few moments, you're gonna go under.

27:49.294 --> 27:50.838
Okay. I think I--

27:52.589 --> 27:54.925
I thi--

28:02.933 --> 28:04.852
Like, you having a moment.
You having a day.

28:28.625 --> 28:29.626
Thank you.

28:37.509 --> 28:38.927
So, he has everything?

28:39.636 --> 28:42.389
Even the memories
you've stored deep in your subconscious.

28:48.896 --> 28:50.856
All those memories,
they're not just mine.

28:50.939 --> 28:53.275
They're my wife's, my son's.

28:53.358 --> 28:55.819
Not part of some experiment.

28:56.486 --> 28:58.155
I just wish I could talk to her.

28:59.072 --> 29:01.283
When they sent "me 2.0" back,

29:02.075 --> 29:05.162
seeing my mom look into her eyes
not knowing it wasn't me,

29:05.704 --> 29:07.623
seeing her talking to my daughterâ€¦

29:08.582 --> 29:09.583
I meanâ€¦

29:12.711 --> 29:14.338
And then when they wiped herâ€¦

29:16.507 --> 29:20.469
knowing she was no longer in on the lie,
my guilt faded pretty quick.

29:24.723 --> 29:26.683
We share an oncologist, you know?

29:27.935 --> 29:29.144
Dr. Kerosima?

29:29.978 --> 29:30.979
Yep.

29:32.397 --> 29:36.235
The patient before me
was a patient of hers too.

29:42.032 --> 29:45.911
She seemed happy, your daughter.
They both did.

29:52.209 --> 29:53.210
Yeah?

30:00.509 --> 30:02.135
How long has she been out there?

30:05.597 --> 30:06.807
Roughlyâ€¦

30:08.058 --> 30:09.601
forty-two days, six hours.

30:11.270 --> 30:12.312
Roughly?

30:14.022 --> 30:15.023
Ballpark.

30:22.322 --> 30:24.867
Memory cross-checks
allow us to make sure

30:24.950 --> 30:27.119
that his conscious
and subconscious memories

30:27.202 --> 30:29.538
are perfectly in sync with yours.

30:30.497 --> 30:32.833
It will feel strange at first.

30:33.333 --> 30:36.003
Just try to stay in each memory.

30:41.550 --> 30:43.218
In your own time, Cameron.

30:48.765 --> 30:49.933
Cameron.

30:51.685 --> 30:52.686
Hi.

30:52.769 --> 30:55.063
Cameron, I like your picture.

30:56.481 --> 30:57.566
Breathe.

30:59.109 --> 31:03.864
It feels real because as far as
your brain is concerned, it is real.

31:05.073 --> 31:07.367
Just, skipped way back.

31:07.451 --> 31:08.785
That's normal.

31:09.411 --> 31:12.623
As it progresses,
the system will test any point in time

31:12.706 --> 31:14.124
all the way back to birth.

31:15.834 --> 31:18.754
It's vital that you do your best
to stay in the memories

31:18.837 --> 31:21.548
and not break the flow, okay?

31:23.300 --> 31:25.010
Okay.

31:25.636 --> 31:26.929
When you're good.

31:30.098 --> 31:34.102
<i>Hi, remember me
from a few weeks back?</i>

31:34.186 --> 31:38.315
Yeah. You ate my chocolate bar.

31:38.982 --> 31:42.444
See, I also purchased an Echo bar.

31:42.528 --> 31:45.280
And I'm hoping
you worked that out by now. Yeah.

31:45.364 --> 31:48.909
Yeah. I'd have loved to see your face
when you realized.

31:49.785 --> 31:51.912
Not a strong moment for me.

31:54.581 --> 31:58.293
I just saw you, um, just sitting here,

31:58.377 --> 32:02.381
and I-- I made this thing.

32:02.464 --> 32:04.049
It's in my bag.

32:05.759 --> 32:06.760
Here you go.

32:14.268 --> 32:17.855
Wow! Wow, you're good.

32:18.730 --> 32:21.233
Oh, thank you. I realize now

32:21.316 --> 32:24.236
that even makes me look
more like a psycho.

32:24.319 --> 32:26.864
-Oh, yeah?
-But I'm not! I'm not. I promise.

32:26.947 --> 32:29.992
A talented psycho is better
than a talentless one, soâ€¦

32:30.075 --> 32:31.827
Yeah. I appreciate that.

32:33.036 --> 32:34.413
I'm Cameron, by the way.

32:36.081 --> 32:38.542
Cameron. Poppy.

32:40.502 --> 32:41.503
Poppy.

32:42.796 --> 32:43.797
Pleasure.

32:45.757 --> 32:47.759
My stop's coming up.

32:47.843 --> 32:52.097
Oh, okay. Um, all right.
Well, I'll let you go.

32:53.473 --> 32:56.518
Sorry again for eating your candy bar.

32:57.603 --> 32:59.146
I hope to see you around.

32:59.229 --> 33:01.815
<i>-The next station is Summit Park.</i>
-All right, best wishes.

33:04.484 --> 33:05.861
Best wishes.

33:08.113 --> 33:09.114
Hey, Cameron?

33:12.284 --> 33:13.368
Here.

33:13.452 --> 33:15.204
Oh, no, that's for you. Keep it.

33:15.871 --> 33:16.872
Give it to me again.

33:18.081 --> 33:19.082
Okay.

33:39.561 --> 33:40.562
Poppy.

34:00.082 --> 34:04.002
-Yeah? Are you scared yet?
-I'm a little bit scared.

34:04.086 --> 34:05.879
Like, there's a lot going on there.

34:10.007 --> 34:12.052
You mean that awful thing
I made the other day?

34:15.597 --> 34:17.431
Yes!

34:18.475 --> 34:19.476
Let me out.

34:19.560 --> 34:21.562
You hold on a little bit.
I'm not ready for you.

34:23.272 --> 34:25.649
<i>We've been waiting so long for you.</i>

34:30.237 --> 34:33.322
<i>She reminds me so much of Cory.
You're so sweet.</i>

34:36.368 --> 34:38.245
And then there was a third one.

34:38.328 --> 34:40.873
I don't wanna look at you.
It makes me laugh.

34:47.545 --> 34:48.880
Mommy.

34:48.964 --> 34:50.674
-I'm not going back in.
-It's okay.

34:54.719 --> 34:56.429
<i>I saw her upstairs in her room,</i>

34:56.513 --> 34:59.474
<i>and she was crying,
and she looked really sad.</i>

35:00.726 --> 35:01.602
Is it because of Andre?

35:01.685 --> 35:05.522
Cameron Turner, my twin brother, Andre.

35:06.815 --> 35:07.983
Hey, Andre.

35:08.066 --> 35:11.820
-I should have stopped him.
-No, no, no, no.

35:11.904 --> 35:13.488
I should have stopped him.

35:16.033 --> 35:19.244
It's my fault, Cam. It's my fault.

35:24.166 --> 35:26.001
-I--
-You good, Cameron?

35:28.295 --> 35:30.297
-I'm sorry. I need a second.
-All right.

35:47.731 --> 35:48.732
All right. Let's go.

35:54.154 --> 35:55.739
<i>You're booking days off now?</i>

35:55.822 --> 35:58.784
Yeah, I booked time off
so we can hang out when I get back.

35:58.867 --> 36:02.538
<i>I've been trying to peel you away
from your desk for the last six months.</i>

36:02.621 --> 36:04.748
<i>Suddenly you're gung-ho
to drop everything.</i>

36:05.999 --> 36:07.835
<i>I know. You're right. It's--</i>

36:10.921 --> 36:11.922
<i>Bear?</i>

36:13.924 --> 36:16.134
-<i>You good?</i>
-Yeah. Yes.

36:17.678 --> 36:18.679
<i>Yeah?</i>

36:20.514 --> 36:22.766
<i>Are you sure you're happy about this?</i>

36:24.017 --> 36:26.520
<i>Yeah. The last couple of weeks you justâ€¦</i>

36:27.521 --> 36:28.730
I don't know. Just--

36:30.148 --> 36:33.652
Hey, P. I'm fine.
It's just work. I'm working.

36:33.735 --> 36:37.072
Iâ€¦ I just hate being away from you.
That's all.

36:38.115 --> 36:39.324
<i>And I just miss us.</i>

36:40.117 --> 36:43.161
<i>When I get home, we're gonna hang out
and talk for real, okay?</i>

36:43.829 --> 36:45.247
<i>Okay, Cameron.</i>

36:48.667 --> 36:50.502
Oh, my God.

36:52.004 --> 36:54.756
Okay, you're definitely taking the blame
for this specimen.

36:54.840 --> 36:57.926
No.
I believe Cory picked that out himself.

36:58.010 --> 37:01.180
-What? At three months?
<i>-Yeah. Because I was with him.</i>

37:01.805 --> 37:02.973
<i>We were in the store walking around,</i>

37:03.056 --> 37:06.768
and I'm pushing him in the stroller.
And he's like, "Hey. Yo, big man.

37:06.852 --> 37:09.563
You see that yellow mustard onesie
right there?

37:09.646 --> 37:11.315
I need that in my life."

37:11.398 --> 37:14.401
Yeah, he's so charming. I was like,
"Hey, what do you say to that?"

37:15.652 --> 37:18.405
Yeah, he is very charming.
I'll give you that.

37:19.239 --> 37:20.532
<i>But this is criminal.</i>

37:34.463 --> 37:36.715
<i>Together,
me and you will take care of her</i>

37:36.798 --> 37:39.009
<i>till she can take care of herself again.
All right?</i>

37:40.135 --> 37:43.430
Me and you gotta be strong for her, okay?
She's just sick right now.

37:44.264 --> 37:45.516
Go away.

37:45.599 --> 37:47.434
Wake up, man. Come on.

37:50.312 --> 37:52.898
At least six more hours.

37:52.981 --> 37:54.525
Six more hours?

37:54.608 --> 37:56.443
It's still dark outside. Look!

37:57.319 --> 37:59.988
'Cause it's early.
But you gotta wake up, man. We gotta go.

38:00.572 --> 38:02.449
Let this hand go. There, boom.

38:02.533 --> 38:05.202
-And now flick it. Follow through.
-Boom.

38:08.872 --> 38:10.624
I used to do this all day in my room.

38:10.707 --> 38:12.918
-That smells so good.
-You think?

38:13.001 --> 38:16.672
-Kale. Kale. Kale. Mint. And mint.
-Yes. All right.

38:16.755 --> 38:19.091
Dip 'em in a little--
a little soy sauce.

38:39.945 --> 38:42.781
<i>Okay.
I'm standing by up here.</i>

38:44.825 --> 38:46.410
How long will it take?

38:47.619 --> 38:49.121
He should wake instantly.

38:51.957 --> 38:55.169
Okay. We're ready to go up here.

39:03.510 --> 39:04.511
All right.

39:05.846 --> 39:07.181
Okay.

39:08.932 --> 39:10.767
Keep your eyes closed.

39:11.518 --> 39:13.270
I'm gonna count you down from three.

39:14.730 --> 39:15.731
And on threeâ€¦

39:17.316 --> 39:18.317
And twoâ€¦

39:20.611 --> 39:21.695
And one.

39:44.676 --> 39:45.761
You're okay.

39:46.803 --> 39:48.138
Breathe.

39:52.059 --> 39:54.061
-That's it?
-That's it.

39:58.482 --> 39:59.733
Everything go okay?

39:59.816 --> 40:00.817
Everything went great.

40:05.948 --> 40:07.157
When will I see him?

40:07.658 --> 40:08.659
In the morning.

40:09.451 --> 40:11.328
Until then, you should get some sleep.

40:18.627 --> 40:21.004
<i>For the time
that you are in this facility,</i>

40:21.088 --> 40:24.466
that freckle is the only place
on your entire body

40:24.550 --> 40:26.718
that isn't identical to his.

40:27.928 --> 40:30.013
If you get confused,

40:30.097 --> 40:35.185
you find that freckle
and you'll know who you are. Okay?

40:37.479 --> 40:39.982
We know how strange this is.

40:43.902 --> 40:45.696
You got the good deal here.

40:47.990 --> 40:48.991
You'll see.

40:50.951 --> 40:53.704
<i>Boom! Again.</i>

40:53.787 --> 40:55.998
-Little chin music.
-<i>You're going down.</i>

40:56.081 --> 40:58.041
You don't know nothing about this, boy.

40:59.793 --> 41:01.545
You too young.

41:02.379 --> 41:03.380
Chump.

41:03.463 --> 41:05.215
Yeah!

41:11.513 --> 41:12.514
<i>Boom!</i>

41:12.598 --> 41:15.976
-<i>Yeah, baby!</i>
-That's just another cheap left.

41:20.981 --> 41:21.982
End call.

41:22.649 --> 41:23.859
<i>Dad?</i>

41:26.403 --> 41:28.447
-<i>Hey, Cameron?</i>
-<i>Talk to me, Cameron.</i>

41:28.530 --> 41:30.824
-<i>No.</i>
-<i>Send Poppy a message.</i>

41:39.082 --> 41:42.503
<i>They're saying
any of these seizures could kill me.</i>

41:44.546 --> 41:48.425
And I could die out here this week
before getting home to see them.

41:52.846 --> 41:56.808
I can't stop picturing her
getting the news, having to tell Cory.

42:03.398 --> 42:05.609
Poppy and I had been
going through some stuff.

42:06.318 --> 42:08.362
The other night I made her laugh.

42:09.154 --> 42:11.865
I can't remember
the last time I did that, you know?

42:12.699 --> 42:13.909
Just made her laugh.

42:15.536 --> 42:17.079
That's because you're not funny.

42:21.458 --> 42:22.876
Yeah, that too.

42:38.475 --> 42:39.977
Those things will kill you, you know.

42:40.060 --> 42:43.272
Oh, you are funny. Fuck that.

42:46.149 --> 42:47.150
Cameron?

42:48.277 --> 42:49.319
We're ready for you.

42:55.909 --> 42:56.910
See you later.

42:59.037 --> 43:00.038
Have fun.

43:07.588 --> 43:09.423
Poppy's the world's best sleeper.

43:10.632 --> 43:12.968
When she's tired,
she'll just drift off in seconds,

43:13.051 --> 43:14.595
like, out like a light.

43:15.929 --> 43:17.514
Poppy speaks French?

43:19.349 --> 43:21.852
Yeah, she'll still say
the occasional French word.

43:24.104 --> 43:25.731
Like, she'll sayâ€¦

43:27.441 --> 43:28.442
Orâ€¦

43:34.698 --> 43:37.409
Or if something is great,
like, just perfect,

43:37.492 --> 43:39.077
she might whisperâ€¦

43:58.764 --> 44:00.516
You wanna go say hi?

44:32.172 --> 44:33.173
You okay?

44:35.092 --> 44:36.218
After last night?

44:39.930 --> 44:40.931
Good.

44:47.020 --> 44:48.522
I don't know how toâ€¦

44:50.816 --> 44:52.568
What to say here.

44:56.113 --> 44:57.531
I know you don't think I'mâ€¦

45:05.330 --> 45:06.331
You.

45:13.130 --> 45:15.632
I'm sitting up in that room,
looking at Rafa.

45:16.216 --> 45:20.053
<i>My heart is beating
out of my chest, and, um, I'm nervous.</i>

45:21.013 --> 45:22.306
I'm really nervous.

45:26.393 --> 45:27.936
Then Dad pops in my head.

45:31.815 --> 45:34.359
That first trip out to see him
after they split.

45:35.944 --> 45:37.779
Getting on that airplane.

45:39.323 --> 45:40.991
Just the nerves, you know?

45:41.742 --> 45:43.160
And I close my eyes.

45:46.455 --> 45:47.873
And then I open 'em.

45:53.504 --> 45:55.506
I'm not up there
in that room anymore.

45:58.258 --> 45:59.259
I'm here.

46:02.971 --> 46:04.056
I am here.

46:09.144 --> 46:12.523
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:21.657 --> 46:23.659
He knows you're nervous, Jack.

46:24.910 --> 46:26.745
Just answer the questions.

46:32.751 --> 46:34.670
-<i>Audio muted.</i>
-Cameronâ€¦

46:36.255 --> 46:37.256
you're you.

46:38.757 --> 46:41.552
There are no wrong answers.

46:49.101 --> 46:50.310
<i>Audio unmuted.</i>

46:50.394 --> 46:54.731
Okay, Jack.
Poppy works with children.

46:55.649 --> 46:58.277
Yeah, she teaches
kids with learning difficulties

46:58.360 --> 47:00.153
through music therapy.

47:01.238 --> 47:03.866
She's got her own take
on the Orff Schulwerk method.

47:05.075 --> 47:11.790
So, um, she makes songs with the kids,
and she puts them in the songs.

47:11.874 --> 47:15.210
Andâ€¦ they love it.

47:18.297 --> 47:20.257
She's just insanely talented.

47:22.384 --> 47:27.222
She cares. You know?
Like, she really cares.

47:28.390 --> 47:29.975
<i>Did you always want children?</i>

47:33.604 --> 47:35.439
I like this, Cameron Turner.

47:36.481 --> 47:39.026
I think after I met Poppy,
I realized I wanted kids.

47:39.109 --> 47:40.694
I like all of this.

47:40.777 --> 47:42.321
Yeah.

47:42.404 --> 47:44.573
<i>I was cynical for a long time.</i>

47:44.656 --> 47:47.701
Wow. Oh, my gosh.

47:48.785 --> 47:51.872
We have scarily similar taste in books.

47:51.955 --> 47:56.210
<i>This idea
of finding true love or a soul mate.</i>

47:57.252 --> 48:01.256
<i>Then someone like Poppy comes along
and you realize you're just surviving.</i>

48:01.340 --> 48:02.341
Do you play?

48:04.176 --> 48:05.302
I butcher.

48:06.386 --> 48:08.680
But I'm not playing in front of you.

48:08.764 --> 48:11.767
I could have
just gone on like that forever.

48:11.850 --> 48:15.687
<i>You better stop
And think about what you doing</i>

48:20.943 --> 48:23.237
Oh, I love it. Yes.

48:23.320 --> 48:24.530
I just lucked out, I guess.

48:27.074 --> 48:28.075
Good.

48:29.952 --> 48:32.287
Talk about
your parents' relationship.

48:33.163 --> 48:35.916
Well, there's not really
much to talk about.

48:36.458 --> 48:39.962
They divorced when I was five,
and my dad moved away for work.

48:41.004 --> 48:43.131
He was a doctor. A pediatrician.

48:51.932 --> 48:56.687
He looks like me.
He sounds like me, but I don't knowâ€¦

48:58.605 --> 49:02.025
In seven months, that child is gonna
come into the world without a dad.

49:06.363 --> 49:07.447
Seven months.

49:07.948 --> 49:10.367
Hey. At least you're not
feeling sorry for yourself.

49:11.535 --> 49:13.370
Oh, okay. That's fair.

49:14.371 --> 49:15.622
You're gonna be good, man.

49:15.706 --> 49:16.707
That's fair.

49:19.418 --> 49:22.045
And what about you? How you doing?

49:23.297 --> 49:24.298
Me?

49:25.048 --> 49:26.550
Never better.

49:26.633 --> 49:27.759
Any other great questions?

49:27.843 --> 49:29.344
No. Okay.

49:30.304 --> 49:31.305
Yep.

49:32.222 --> 49:33.974
Having the time of my life out here.

49:34.057 --> 49:36.977
Nature's awesome. Great food.

49:44.401 --> 49:45.402
Cameron?

49:46.445 --> 49:47.863
Make it obscure.

49:49.156 --> 49:52.492
Andre. Gift.

49:55.329 --> 49:56.830
Am I actually gonna like this?

49:56.914 --> 49:58.916
-Probably not. It's probably--
-Oh, God. What?

49:58.999 --> 50:01.084
-Lift your feet up high.
-Lift my feet up where?

50:01.168 --> 50:04.087
-And step. Step. Step.
-Whoa! Oops. Oh, no! No! Oh.

50:04.171 --> 50:05.631
There we go. There you go.

50:05.714 --> 50:07.299
We're safe. We're safe.

50:07.883 --> 50:08.884
What is it?

50:12.012 --> 50:15.265
You got me a piano!

50:17.893 --> 50:19.228
Andre!

50:20.729 --> 50:21.730
Oh, my God.

50:21.813 --> 50:24.816
-Thank you so much.
-<i>And he was so like Poppy.</i>

50:24.900 --> 50:28.904
<i>Like, just wildly smart and gentle.</i>

50:29.988 --> 50:31.448
What happened to him?

50:32.824 --> 50:39.039
Andreâ€¦ was thrown from his bike
off of a mountain road.

50:40.707 --> 50:45.087
His body landed in the branches
of a pine tree, high up.

50:46.421 --> 50:50.592
<i>Every couple of weeks, I dream
about him up there in the treetops.</i>

50:52.886 --> 50:55.472
<i>Alone. Just laying there.</i>

51:01.854 --> 51:04.273
Have you talked to your wife
about that dream?

51:04.356 --> 51:05.357
No.

51:06.024 --> 51:07.025
Why not?

51:07.693 --> 51:10.279
She didn't leave the house
for the better part of a year.

51:13.282 --> 51:16.201
Slept in the guest room
most of that time, soâ€¦

51:16.285 --> 51:17.786
I'm just trying to help you.

51:20.539 --> 51:21.748
I know, I know.

51:22.708 --> 51:24.877
-I need to be alone. Thank you.
-Please--

51:25.460 --> 51:29.506
It's not really subject matter
we enjoy getting into.

51:31.884 --> 51:34.678
How did Poppy sleeping apart
make you feel?

51:36.805 --> 51:37.806
Alone.

51:39.224 --> 51:40.851
Mostly, I worried about her.

51:42.394 --> 51:43.395
I missed her.

51:45.147 --> 51:47.107
Did you resent her for it?

51:47.983 --> 51:49.484
<i>She lost her twin.</i>

51:50.485 --> 51:54.740
<i>She never felt good
about him getting that motorcycle.</i>

51:56.325 --> 51:59.161
<i>Blamed herself for not protesting more.</i>

51:59.244 --> 52:01.914
<i>But he was gonna get the bike anyway.</i>

52:03.081 --> 52:06.960
You've mentioned how well
Poppy has progressed with her therapist

52:07.044 --> 52:08.462
over the last few months.

52:09.213 --> 52:11.131
But you never went to see anybody?

52:11.632 --> 52:13.300
No.

52:14.927 --> 52:17.888
Did you talk to someone
after your parents were divorced?

52:18.555 --> 52:19.890
No, I was five.

52:21.683 --> 52:23.810
So you've never been to a therapist?

52:23.894 --> 52:24.895
No.

52:24.978 --> 52:28.815
And you can't talk to Poppy
about this dream that you keep having?

52:28.899 --> 52:32.653
It's been two years.
Why haven't you gone to see somebody?

52:32.736 --> 52:33.737
I don't know.

52:37.074 --> 52:38.075
Cameron?

52:40.160 --> 52:41.411
I'm sorry, I--

52:46.792 --> 52:48.001
I'm sorry.

52:49.253 --> 52:50.254
It's okay.

52:54.007 --> 52:55.217
Let's take a break.

53:20.284 --> 53:21.493
Saving them for you.

53:41.054 --> 53:42.055
<i>All right.</i>

53:42.723 --> 53:45.392
Jack, are you ready?

53:45.893 --> 53:46.894
Yeah.

53:47.769 --> 53:49.104
-Cameron?
-Yeah.

53:51.481 --> 53:52.482
All right.

53:53.317 --> 53:55.152
Call Poppy, please.

54:02.826 --> 54:06.663
<i>This is weird timing.
I just spoke to the clinic.</i>

54:07.414 --> 54:11.084
<i>Doctor Herbert is confirmed
for the ultrasound on the 25th.</i>

54:16.632 --> 54:17.633
<i>Cam?</i>

54:19.843 --> 54:21.053
That's real.

54:21.136 --> 54:25.557
<i>Yeah. So real. Living human in body.</i>

54:25.641 --> 54:28.727
Just feels so different
to how I remember it with Cory, right?

54:28.810 --> 54:29.811
<i>Yeah.</i>

54:31.939 --> 54:33.774
Remember how we found out?

54:33.857 --> 54:37.736
<i>Oh, my God, yeah.
That insane snow.</i>

54:38.320 --> 54:40.113
<i>Jessie and Zoe's wedding the next day.</i>

54:40.197 --> 54:42.449
Zoe knew right away.

54:42.950 --> 54:46.578
<i>"Oh, my God. You're pregnant, Poppy."</i>

54:47.412 --> 54:50.749
Oh, I remember that feeling.

54:50.832 --> 54:52.668
You were barely
out of the doctor's office,

54:52.751 --> 54:54.920
you were already making a playlist,
holding the speaker there.

54:55.003 --> 54:59.842
<i>Yeah. Yes. Womb tunes.</i>

54:59.925 --> 55:03.595
Womb tunes. Oh, it's been a minute.

55:05.222 --> 55:06.932
<i>Hey, we should tell Cory soon, too.</i>

55:08.642 --> 55:10.310
Yeah, I was thinking the same--

55:11.311 --> 55:13.605
Rafa, send Poppy a message.

55:15.691 --> 55:17.776
-What did you do?
-I don't like this.

55:20.821 --> 55:24.575
And you think I like this?
Talking to my wife under a spotlight?

55:24.658 --> 55:26.118
She's not your wife!

55:26.201 --> 55:29.663
Oh, okay. Okay, I see.

55:29.746 --> 55:32.583
You can't bear to see this actually work.
That's the real problem.

55:32.666 --> 55:34.251
-Fuck you, man!
-Fuck you!

55:34.334 --> 55:37.129
And what about me?
Waking up in this place,

55:37.212 --> 55:39.548
waiting for you to pull the plug,
being told I'm not me.

55:39.631 --> 55:41.049
Because you're not me.

55:41.842 --> 55:43.802
You are not me!

55:46.972 --> 55:49.683
You know what? Fuck all this.

55:49.766 --> 55:52.227
-No, bullshit. You stay right here.
-This is bullshit! Fuck that!

55:52.311 --> 55:54.855
-Stay here. Bullshit. This is real.
-Open the fucking door!

55:54.938 --> 55:56.773
And you know it. You know it.

55:56.857 --> 56:00.485
Poppy said if she couldn't tell,
if her mom was indistinguishableâ€¦

56:00.569 --> 56:02.821
Well, here it is. Indistinguishable.

56:02.905 --> 56:05.073
You won't go through with it
because you're too selfish!

56:05.157 --> 56:06.658
Get the fuck off me.

56:06.742 --> 56:08.869
I'm done with you. Huh?

56:08.952 --> 56:12.497
Do something?
Do it. Fuck you, do it. Do it!

56:13.457 --> 56:16.251
Yeah. You won't leave this place.

56:16.335 --> 56:19.588
I'm going home, and I'm telling them
everything. Everything!

56:20.088 --> 56:22.341
Yeah, I bet you will. Bitch ass.

56:22.424 --> 56:24.426
It's always about you.
It's always about you.

56:24.510 --> 56:26.220
She's been trying to talk
for I don't know how long,

56:26.303 --> 56:27.387
and you keep shutting her out,

56:27.471 --> 56:29.806
because deep down inside,
you feel like she abandoned us.

56:29.890 --> 56:31.892
-I never thought that! I never!
-You did!

56:31.975 --> 56:33.268
You did--

56:33.352 --> 56:36.355
Hey, hey. Hey.

56:36.438 --> 56:38.774
It's okay. It's okay. Breathe, breathe.

56:40.234 --> 56:41.235
Cam?

56:54.206 --> 56:55.624
What the fuck, man?

57:00.420 --> 57:02.339
<i>He shouldn't go home in that state.</i>

57:10.472 --> 57:14.476
I'll talk to him,
but it's in his contract.

57:18.230 --> 57:19.439
I need to see him.

58:17.581 --> 58:20.000
I remember when I knew
she was gonna be okay.

58:30.636 --> 58:34.431
<i>I used to cry for Tracy</i>

58:34.515 --> 58:37.684
<i>I wanted to see him again</i>

58:40.020 --> 58:46.818
<i>But sometimes
Sometimes life ain't always the way</i>

58:51.532 --> 58:57.913
<i>Sometimes it snows in April</i>

59:01.500 --> 59:06.505
<i>Sometimes I feel so bad</i>

59:07.714 --> 59:09.216
<i>So bad</i>

59:10.592 --> 59:17.558
<i>Sometimes I wish life is never-ending</i>

59:19.643 --> 59:25.941
<i>And all good things
They say never last</i>

59:30.112 --> 59:32.155
<i>And love</i>

59:33.156 --> 59:39.538
<i>It isn't hard till it's passed</i>

59:57.681 --> 1:00:02.477
Hey, uhâ€¦ I'm really sorry about earlier.

1:00:03.228 --> 1:00:04.855
I don't think she abandoned us.

1:00:08.901 --> 1:00:10.360
No, there's something to it.

1:00:12.029 --> 1:00:13.238
There's something to it.

1:00:15.365 --> 1:00:18.202
She'd been trying to talk to me
for a long time in her own way.

1:00:18.869 --> 1:00:20.454
Thought I had more time, I guess.

1:00:22.331 --> 1:00:24.958
I just told her about that dizzy spell
three months ago.

1:00:27.419 --> 1:00:29.630
If I'd had mentioned
the headache back then--

1:00:30.756 --> 1:00:33.050
She'd have marched us in
for a scan that day.

1:00:35.219 --> 1:00:36.845
And got to it before it spread.

1:00:38.805 --> 1:00:40.015
Dealt with it together.

1:00:46.355 --> 1:00:50.150
I know you got to go back
and see them. I get it.

1:00:51.527 --> 1:00:52.945
Do the right thing here.

1:00:54.071 --> 1:00:56.907
In seven months, that baby--

1:00:56.990 --> 1:00:57.991
Don't do that.

1:00:58.075 --> 1:01:01.245
If you tell her, you're saying it for you.
I'm saying that for them.

1:01:01.328 --> 1:01:02.329
Enough.

1:01:20.764 --> 1:01:21.765
Morning.

1:01:25.060 --> 1:01:26.562
Hey, Jack.

1:01:27.145 --> 1:01:29.815
Hey, hey. You're okay. It's okay.

1:01:32.276 --> 1:01:34.069
-Oh, shit.
-You're okay.

1:01:34.152 --> 1:01:35.153
You're okay.

1:01:37.823 --> 1:01:38.824
Yeah.

1:01:43.662 --> 1:01:46.498
<i>Monitoring your lens feed
while you're back at home</i>

1:01:46.582 --> 1:01:49.877
<i>is an important part
of Jack's psychological evaluation.</i>

1:01:50.377 --> 1:01:51.670
Nothing's ever recorded?

1:01:52.337 --> 1:01:53.630
That's the policy.

1:01:55.132 --> 1:01:57.467
And only Jack has access to this feed?

1:01:57.968 --> 1:01:59.720
No one sees or hears a thing.

1:02:06.101 --> 1:02:07.519
Access granted.

1:02:11.398 --> 1:02:14.484
<i>Now, try your best
to forget about all this,</i>

1:02:14.568 --> 1:02:16.987
<i>and just enjoy your time with them.</i>

1:02:19.364 --> 1:02:21.617
We'll see you in three days, Cameron.

1:02:21.700 --> 1:02:25.954
Try to put everything out of your mind.
Just enjoy your time at home.

1:02:30.375 --> 1:02:31.543
Do come back.

1:05:18.001 --> 1:05:19.336
Oh, my God.

1:05:20.921 --> 1:05:23.006
Call him. Send a car.

1:05:32.558 --> 1:05:33.559
Oh, my God.

1:05:35.102 --> 1:05:36.103
Pick up.

1:05:37.145 --> 1:05:41.775
<i>Cameron, there will be
a car there in a moment. Try to stand up.</i>

1:06:05.382 --> 1:06:06.884
<i>Cameron?</i>

1:06:06.967 --> 1:06:09.011
<i>We're gonna need you to come back.</i>

1:06:09.094 --> 1:06:10.095
I just got home.

1:06:10.179 --> 1:06:12.639
We might just need to
change your medication,

1:06:12.723 --> 1:06:14.308
but we gotta have a look at you.

1:06:14.391 --> 1:06:15.559
<i>I'm not going back.</i>

1:06:15.642 --> 1:06:19.438
If you stay and you have
another seizure without supervision,

1:06:19.521 --> 1:06:21.857
<i>you could die in front of your family.</i>

1:06:22.816 --> 1:06:23.817
Fuck you.

1:06:25.444 --> 1:06:27.279
Fuck. Fuck.

1:06:29.531 --> 1:06:30.532
Cameron?

1:06:32.743 --> 1:06:34.244
<i>Cameron, talk to me.</i>

1:07:01.438 --> 1:07:03.065
Jack goes in the morning.

1:07:05.067 --> 1:07:08.904
I haven't finished evaluating
his psychological state yet.

1:07:10.113 --> 1:07:12.324
I'm not comfortable with Jack going home.

1:07:13.158 --> 1:07:15.160
Poppy's expecting him back.

1:07:15.244 --> 1:07:19.081
-I have--
-Jack is ready. He goes first thing.

1:07:21.041 --> 1:07:22.960
We're covered for this in the contract.

1:07:23.836 --> 1:07:26.880
It will be noted
that you opposed the decision.

1:07:27.673 --> 1:07:30.050
Tell Jack to call Poppy now.

1:07:32.261 --> 1:07:37.307
You slipped in the shower.
Mild concussion. Scan was all good.

1:07:37.391 --> 1:07:38.392
Home tomorrow.

1:07:38.976 --> 1:07:39.977
All right.

1:07:48.569 --> 1:07:51.947
If these two weeks
at home go well, which they will,

1:07:52.656 --> 1:07:55.075
your memory of this process
will be removed

1:07:55.158 --> 1:07:56.994
and we will not see you here again.

1:07:59.705 --> 1:08:03.709
If Cameron wakes up,
he will monitor your lens feed.

1:08:04.376 --> 1:08:07.004
But unless there are any issues
over the next two weeks,

1:08:07.087 --> 1:08:09.256
he will not have the option to stop this.

1:08:11.550 --> 1:08:15.387
I know this isn't as we planned it,
but you're ready, Jack.

1:08:15.971 --> 1:08:18.265
Don't think of these two weeks as a test.

1:08:19.308 --> 1:08:20.392
Just going home.

1:08:54.468 --> 1:08:57.386
Bear? Let me see you.

1:08:58.971 --> 1:09:00.307
Are you okay?

1:09:00.390 --> 1:09:03.810
-Just-- Just a little bit sore. I'm fine.
-Yeah?

1:09:03.894 --> 1:09:05.312
The swelling's gone down.

1:09:06.729 --> 1:09:07.731
What did they say?

1:09:09.316 --> 1:09:12.528
I'll be a little bit fuzzy
for a few days. But I'm good.

1:09:14.863 --> 1:09:15.738
Come here.

1:09:32.130 --> 1:09:33.131
<i>You scared me.</i>

1:09:33.215 --> 1:09:34.383
<i>I scared me.</i>

1:09:48.438 --> 1:09:50.357
He's waiting for you up in his room.

1:09:53.068 --> 1:09:55.904
-Who?
-Your son.

1:10:03.287 --> 1:10:04.413
Shut up.

1:10:06.874 --> 1:10:08.041
Asshole.

1:10:09.168 --> 1:10:10.377
I'm sorry, I had to.

1:10:10.460 --> 1:10:12.796
Shit, Cam. Don't freak me out like that.

1:10:13.505 --> 1:10:14.673
Wanker.

1:10:15.257 --> 1:10:16.717
-Come here.
-No.

1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:18.552
Come here.

1:10:18.635 --> 1:10:21.346
-No way.
-I'm sorry.

1:10:29.188 --> 1:10:30.397
Easy, tiger.

1:10:33.317 --> 1:10:34.568
Pig.

1:10:34.651 --> 1:10:36.195
What the hell? Ellington?

1:10:37.446 --> 1:10:38.655
Hey, pal.

1:10:39.948 --> 1:10:41.867
Wow, I think Pig's pissed at you

1:10:41.950 --> 1:10:44.995
for leaving town
and hitting your head.

1:10:45.078 --> 1:10:48.999
Wow, he is not letting it go. Ellington.

1:10:50.876 --> 1:10:52.002
Okay, Pig.

1:10:52.961 --> 1:10:54.379
I'll stick him outside.

1:10:55.881 --> 1:10:57.216
I'll go check on Doc.

1:11:26.453 --> 1:11:27.663
Hey.

1:11:29.331 --> 1:11:31.792
Ra-- What happened?

1:11:32.668 --> 1:11:33.669
You passed out.

1:11:36.296 --> 1:11:39.383
You've been unconscious
for almost 24 hours.

1:11:41.552 --> 1:11:42.553
What does Poppy think?

1:11:43.428 --> 1:11:44.972
Everything's fine, Cameron.

1:11:47.641 --> 1:11:48.642
What does that mean?

1:11:52.688 --> 1:11:53.689
He's not gone.

1:11:54.398 --> 1:11:58.318
We've been monitoring it all
while you were out. Everything's good.

1:11:58.402 --> 1:12:01.780
No. No, no, no. I didn't get--

1:12:01.864 --> 1:12:03.699
I'm so sorry that it happened this wayâ€¦

1:12:03.782 --> 1:12:05.200
I'm not done. I didn't say he could go.

1:12:05.284 --> 1:12:07.160
-â€¦but it was the right decision.
-Bullshit.

1:12:07.244 --> 1:12:08.704
I'm not done!

1:12:08.787 --> 1:12:10.330
Well, it's not about you now.

1:12:10.914 --> 1:12:11.915
Excuse me?

1:12:11.999 --> 1:12:15.419
-You have an opportunity that no one gets.
-No. No, no, no.

1:12:15.502 --> 1:12:17.004
Don't be blind, Cameron.

1:12:17.087 --> 1:12:18.505
-Fuck you.
-You're dying.

1:12:23.343 --> 1:12:24.344
You're dying.

1:12:30.267 --> 1:12:32.477
-You're dying, Cam--
-Stop!

1:12:33.937 --> 1:12:34.938
Stop.

1:12:40.235 --> 1:12:41.403
Jack was ready.

1:12:42.988 --> 1:12:44.072
They're in good hands.

1:12:47.451 --> 1:12:48.702
They're in your hands.

1:12:53.999 --> 1:12:55.167
I wanna see the video.

1:12:57.503 --> 1:12:58.504
Now.

1:13:00.506 --> 1:13:02.341
And you need to stop watching my family.

1:13:07.095 --> 1:13:09.598
<i>I learned that from school.
Paper is wood.</i>

1:13:09.681 --> 1:13:11.350
<i>Yes.</i>

1:13:11.975 --> 1:13:13.519
-<i>It's got some-- Let me see.</i>
-<i>Is it?</i>

1:13:13.602 --> 1:13:15.479
<i>Some wood up there.</i>

1:13:15.562 --> 1:13:18.941
<i>Yeah. Yes, sir.</i>

1:13:20.901 --> 1:13:22.861
-This the only feed?
-<i>Okay.</i>

1:13:22.945 --> 1:13:23.946
Yes.

1:13:24.863 --> 1:13:26.281
I'd like to be alone.

1:13:26.907 --> 1:13:28.075
<i>Nope.</i>

1:13:28.158 --> 1:13:31.828
<i>So, what's one thing
I've been trying to get you to do more of?</i>

1:13:34.164 --> 1:13:36.542
-<i>Read?
-Good.</i>

1:13:37.876 --> 1:13:39.628
<i>Here's a little something for you.</i>

1:13:39.711 --> 1:13:41.338
<i>Essentially, it's from your grandmother.</i>

1:13:41.421 --> 1:13:43.924
<i>It's something she gave to me
when I was about your age.</i>

1:13:44.508 --> 1:13:46.218
<i>Open it up, it's a good one.</i>

1:13:47.177 --> 1:13:48.220
<i>Okay.</i>

1:13:48.303 --> 1:13:50.180
<i>She wrote a little something in it.</i>

1:13:56.603 --> 1:13:59.022
<i>I used to kill Andre
for doing this to our books</i>

1:13:59.106 --> 1:14:00.607
<i>when we were growing up.</i>

1:14:00.691 --> 1:14:04.653
<i>Now I'm, like, poring over
every word he underlined.</i>

1:14:14.413 --> 1:14:16.081
<i>Somehow I'm--</i>

1:14:20.210 --> 1:14:22.337
<i>Somehow I'm finally breathing again.</i>

1:14:25.549 --> 1:14:27.634
<i>But I feel like I've lost you, Cam.</i>

1:14:32.139 --> 1:14:34.433
<i>You keep yourself so busy
in a job you hate.</i>

1:14:34.516 --> 1:14:36.435
<i>It's like you're not here.</i>

1:14:37.436 --> 1:14:41.690
<i>And I'm not saying you're fully to blame,
you know?</i> <i>We're both in this.</i>

1:14:44.735 --> 1:14:46.987
<i>I know I checked out for a while.</i>

1:14:48.155 --> 1:14:49.865
<i>And I know that scared you.</i>

1:14:52.075 --> 1:14:55.078
<i>And I'm sorry for that, Cam. I am.</i>

1:14:58.332 --> 1:15:02.836
<i>I mean, hearing you say the words,
"I hit my head," the other dayâ€¦</i>

1:15:07.674 --> 1:15:11.845
<i>I couldn't lose you, Cam. I couldn't live.</i>

1:15:17.142 --> 1:15:22.648
<i>So this is me telling you
that I'm done with the silence now.</i>

1:15:24.566 --> 1:15:29.196
<i>We start communicating, and we fix things.</i>

1:16:10.571 --> 1:16:12.030
I made you a little something.

1:16:30.090 --> 1:16:31.592
It's really insensitive.

1:16:36.096 --> 1:16:39.016
Oh, no. I'm-- I'm sorry. I--

1:16:40.184 --> 1:16:41.602
Oh, shit. I'm so so--

1:16:45.731 --> 1:16:46.732
You little shit.

1:16:49.401 --> 1:16:50.402
You scared me.

1:16:50.903 --> 1:16:52.613
Your face. It's-- It's--

1:16:53.113 --> 1:16:54.615
You scared me. That was good.

1:16:56.700 --> 1:16:59.494
It isâ€¦ It's good. Funny.

1:17:08.754 --> 1:17:10.672
Hey, oh. It's okay.

1:17:13.425 --> 1:17:14.426
You're okay.

1:17:20.766 --> 1:17:22.351
I'm here. You're okay.

1:18:22.870 --> 1:18:24.830
<i>He's taking out the contacts
more and more,</i>

1:18:24.913 --> 1:18:26.415
<i>not just when he goes to bed.</i>

1:18:26.498 --> 1:18:29.960
He doesn't have to wear them all the time.
They make him feel uncomfortable.

1:18:30.627 --> 1:18:32.045
He feels badly for you.

1:18:32.838 --> 1:18:36.216
But he also feels uncomfortable
having his family watched.

1:18:36.300 --> 1:18:38.635
I don't give a shit about his comfort.
That's my family.

1:18:38.719 --> 1:18:41.638
What you're feeling right now,
Cameron, is normal.

1:18:41.722 --> 1:18:43.223
No, it is not.

1:18:43.932 --> 1:18:45.142
Something is wrong.

1:18:45.225 --> 1:18:47.519
For the last couple of days, I feel it.
Something is off.

1:18:47.603 --> 1:18:48.812
At this stage,

1:18:48.896 --> 1:18:53.650
whatever you're going through,
it's normal. He's fine.

1:18:54.776 --> 1:18:55.986
Yeah.

1:19:37.611 --> 1:19:39.029
What's up with you?

1:19:51.708 --> 1:19:54.336
Cory, it's time to eat, buddy.

1:20:02.970 --> 1:20:03.971
Cory. Pause it.

1:20:05.264 --> 1:20:06.265
Cory, come on.

1:20:06.849 --> 1:20:07.850
What do you think?

1:20:12.062 --> 1:20:13.146
I like it.

1:20:13.856 --> 1:20:16.525
-Pecorino instead of Parmesan.
-So good.

1:20:16.608 --> 1:20:17.651
Yeah.

1:20:21.655 --> 1:20:23.490
Come on, man. Now. Pause it.

1:20:24.491 --> 1:20:26.493
Less salty, right?
Kind of sweeter?

1:20:26.577 --> 1:20:27.995
Yeah. It's great.

1:20:32.416 --> 1:20:34.418
-You okay, babe?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1:20:35.419 --> 1:20:37.546
-What's up?
-No. I'm good. I'm good.

1:20:38.589 --> 1:20:39.798
You need to stop!

1:20:54.980 --> 1:20:56.607
Oh, no.

1:21:32.809 --> 1:21:34.061
<i>Access denied.</i>

1:21:35.229 --> 1:21:36.438
<i>Access denied.</i>

1:26:20.138 --> 1:26:22.307
-<i>Yeah. The waddle dance.</i>
-<i>I'm gonna be a big brother!</i>

1:26:22.391 --> 1:26:24.810
-<i>Good job!</i>
-<i>We got the waddle dance.</i>

1:26:28.939 --> 1:26:30.232
<i>I love him.</i>

1:26:52.880 --> 1:26:53.881
Wow.

1:27:40.093 --> 1:27:41.595
Do what you need to do.

1:28:35.107 --> 1:28:37.693
Hey, hey. Just, umâ€¦

1:28:39.653 --> 1:28:40.654
Just be careful.

1:29:18.859 --> 1:29:19.860
Hey, Doc.

1:29:22.529 --> 1:29:23.530
Doc.

1:29:26.617 --> 1:29:27.618
Wake up.

1:29:36.710 --> 1:29:37.961
What's wrong?

1:29:39.338 --> 1:29:42.925
I just had a really bad nightmare,
and I just wanted to see you.

1:29:43.967 --> 1:29:46.762
Hey, I have an idea.

1:29:51.099 --> 1:29:56.063
We're going to pretend
that this is beer, okay?

1:29:56.146 --> 1:29:59.107
My first was with my mom.
I was a lot older than you, though.

1:29:59.191 --> 1:30:02.444
But it's okay. We won't tell anybody.

1:30:02.528 --> 1:30:03.862
Yeah.

1:30:04.571 --> 1:30:08.534
And these guys were her favorite thing
to eat with beer.

1:30:11.036 --> 1:30:13.163
Edamame with loads of salt.

1:30:14.081 --> 1:30:16.625
Washed down with a nice, crisp brew.

1:30:17.543 --> 1:30:19.086
-Yum.
-How do you eat it?

1:30:19.169 --> 1:30:22.631
See? Just grab the top one.
Start one at a time with the top one.

1:30:24.091 --> 1:30:26.510
Pop it out. Yeah, go ahead. Yeah.

1:30:28.220 --> 1:30:30.055
-Tastes good.
-Good, right?

1:30:31.265 --> 1:30:32.683
Better than they look.

1:30:33.684 --> 1:30:35.269
Yeah, now try it with your beer.

1:30:36.061 --> 1:30:37.062
Okay.

1:30:38.272 --> 1:30:41.942
Apple juice, but--
Hold up, hold on. Cheers.

1:30:44.778 --> 1:30:45.946
Long life for you.

1:30:47.281 --> 1:30:49.032
To edamame.

1:31:03.797 --> 1:31:05.007
I'll just take one more.

1:31:06.216 --> 1:31:07.217
Come here, man.

1:31:34.119 --> 1:31:35.454
You okay, Dad?

1:31:42.628 --> 1:31:45.547
Let me look at you, man.
Let me look at that face.

1:31:51.011 --> 1:31:52.471
Yeah, I'm okay.

1:31:56.642 --> 1:31:57.643
I'm okay.

1:32:02.314 --> 1:32:03.315
Cory?

1:32:04.024 --> 1:32:05.067
Yes?

1:32:06.944 --> 1:32:07.945
I love you, man.

1:32:08.946 --> 1:32:10.364
I love you too, Dad.

1:32:17.913 --> 1:32:18.914
I know.

1:32:35.389 --> 1:32:36.390
Be good, Doc.

1:33:27.274 --> 1:33:28.275
P?

1:33:30.319 --> 1:33:31.528
P.

1:33:36.617 --> 1:33:37.826
I love you.

1:33:43.874 --> 1:33:45.000
Poppy, wake up.

1:33:52.049 --> 1:33:53.467
Bear, what's wrong?

1:33:55.093 --> 1:33:56.094
What's wrong?

1:33:58.388 --> 1:33:59.556
It's nothing. I just--

1:34:02.017 --> 1:34:03.852
I just had a really bad dream.

1:34:04.436 --> 1:34:07.606
I got angry at Cory.
Dreamt I lost everything.

1:34:07.689 --> 1:34:10.108
Oh, baby.

1:34:10.692 --> 1:34:11.860
Come here.

1:34:17.366 --> 1:34:20.494
God, you're shaking, sweetheart.
You're shaking.

1:34:21.870 --> 1:34:22.913
It felt so real.

1:34:24.957 --> 1:34:26.166
Oh, sweetheart.

1:34:28.710 --> 1:34:31.463
-We're here. Yeah?
-Yes.

1:34:34.508 --> 1:34:37.469
We're doing better now. Yeah?

1:34:41.390 --> 1:34:43.141
Yeah, we're doing great.

1:34:47.813 --> 1:34:49.773
If it's a boyâ€¦

1:34:51.900 --> 1:34:53.360
we should name him Andre.

1:34:54.570 --> 1:34:55.779
Yeah. I know.

1:35:20.053 --> 1:35:21.054
Poppy?

1:35:21.930 --> 1:35:22.931
Yeah?

1:35:30.772 --> 1:35:31.982
I drifted.

1:35:35.736 --> 1:35:38.280
Cam, stop it. Come here.

1:35:42.409 --> 1:35:44.369
I'm so sorry. I just--

1:35:46.246 --> 1:35:47.247
Listen.

1:35:47.956 --> 1:35:50.209
We're back, yeah?

1:35:52.211 --> 1:35:53.629
And it's wonderful.

1:35:55.214 --> 1:35:56.381
Yeah?

1:35:59.801 --> 1:36:00.802
Yeah.

1:36:06.266 --> 1:36:07.392
Come here.

1:36:26.411 --> 1:36:28.038
Come on, get to sleep.

1:37:46.992 --> 1:37:47.993
Thank you.

1:37:57.044 --> 1:37:58.045
Take care of 'em.

1:38:06.428 --> 1:38:07.429
I will.

1:39:22.629 --> 1:39:26.758
As of this morning,
he's officially Cameron Turner.

1:39:29.970 --> 1:39:32.055
He'll never know about any of this.

1:39:34.766 --> 1:39:35.767
Good.

1:39:39.188 --> 1:39:40.189
Good.

1:39:46.737 --> 1:39:47.738
Thank you, Doc.

1:39:50.866 --> 1:39:51.867
Thank you.

1:40:06.298 --> 1:40:08.091
It's hard to be left behind.

1:40:14.556 --> 1:40:16.683
The new client is about to arrive.

1:40:18.310 --> 1:40:22.272
Come down to us
when you're done speaking with him.

1:40:23.357 --> 1:40:24.775
Jack left you something.

1:41:23.542 --> 1:41:24.793
<i>Babe?</i>

1:41:29.548 --> 1:41:30.841
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

1:41:33.635 --> 1:41:34.636
<i>I love you.</i>

1:41:40.559 --> 1:41:41.977
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1:41:42.060 --> 1:41:43.520
<i>Cam.</i>

1:41:43.604 --> 1:41:46.148
