[Gwen]
Let's do things differently this time.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.251
Like, so differently.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.211
[band playing dramatic rock music]

01:26.295 --> 01:29.006
His name is Miles Morales.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.886
He was bitten by a radioactive spider.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.930
And he's not the only one.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.228
He hasn't always had it easy.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.323
And he's not the only one.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.829
And now he's on his own.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.503
And he's not the only one.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.382
You think you know the rest.

02:15.969 --> 02:16.803
You don't.

02:19.598 --> 02:23.477
I thought I knew the rest, but I didn't.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.564
I didn't wanna hurt him.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.068
But I did.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.531
And he's not the only one.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.250
[Glory] Hey!

02:46.333 --> 02:47.417
Yo, Def Leppard!

02:50.170 --> 02:51.255
Gwen!

02:54.842 --> 02:55.843
Is the song over?

02:56.927 --> 02:58.512
-Seems over.
-[Glory] Are you okay?

02:58.595 --> 03:00.472
You don't hang out,
and you don't wanna talk.

03:00.556 --> 03:01.557
I didn't join a band

03:01.640 --> 03:03.350
-so I could talk about feelings.
-I did.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.853
I joined it
so I could hit my feelings with sticks.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.689
Yo, if you don't tell someone
what's going on,

03:08.772 --> 03:10.190
-you're gonna snap.
-I'm fine.

03:10.274 --> 03:12.526
That's not how someone
who's fine would say that.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.319
They'd say,
"Great. Thanks. How are you?"

03:14.403 --> 03:16.405
-I'm great. Thanks.
-Whoa!

03:17.239 --> 03:18.282
How are you?

03:18.866 --> 03:20.242
Fine?

03:20.325 --> 03:21.910
Gwen. Come on.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.662
-I don't get you, man.
-You're right!

03:24.913 --> 03:26.081
I play drums.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.333
["Self Love" playing]

03:28.417 --> 03:30.335
I always wanted to be in a band.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.381
Guess I just never found the right one.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.842
In this line of work,

03:36.925 --> 03:39.595
you always wind up a solo act.

03:42.306 --> 03:43.640
Before Miles...

03:43.724 --> 03:45.559
-How many did you take?
-...there was Peter.

03:45.642 --> 03:49.730
-I think you look great. I don't know.
-Is this that dangerous menace?

03:49.813 --> 03:51.607
No, no, no. She seems like a good guy.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.609
Why wear a mask
if you've got nothing to hide?

03:53.692 --> 03:55.611
All right,
no politics at the dinner table.

03:55.694 --> 03:56.945
Thank you, May.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.157
But they didn't really know me.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.827
-And I didn't really know him either.
-[grunts]

04:04.453 --> 04:06.622
-Touch him again, Ned.
-[Peter] Gwen, it's okay.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.042
[Gwen] Until it was too late.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.495
[Gwen] What? No.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.997
No, no, no.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.457
What did you do?

04:51.291 --> 04:54.253
I just wanted to be special.

04:55.003 --> 04:55.963
Like you...

04:56.797 --> 04:57.631
Gwen.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.592

-Don't worry.

05:01.176 --> 05:02.302
[Gwen] Who's Gwen?

05:04.137 --> 05:05.889
Everything's gonna be okay.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.349
Don't.

-Everything's gonna...

05:29.288 --> 05:32.291
[Gwen] I never really made another friend
after that.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.046
Except one.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.258
But he's not here.

05:43.635 --> 05:45.929
And there's no way to get there.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.014
[Jonah] Pressure mounts

And why won't she show her face?

for 12 years.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.944
He was my daughter's best friend.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.654
And I will not rest

06:03.280 --> 06:05.407
until I find this Spider-Woman.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.088
Hey, hey, hey. How's the band?

06:20.172 --> 06:23.008
Uh... Uh, yeah, great.
I quit so, you know...

in the Spider-Woman case.

Oh.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.102
That's good.

We're close.
I'm telling you, I can feel it.

Don't be so sure.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.572
She killed your friend.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.991
-You don't know that.
-What do you mean? I do know that.

06:48.075 --> 06:51.119
-I was there. She ran from the scene.
-Maybe she didn't have a choice.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.790
-I got a job to do, Gwen.
-It won't bring him back.

06:59.294 --> 07:03.215
Uh, I don't wanna argue about this, okay?

07:03.715 --> 07:05.175
Yeah, I can tell.

07:11.014 --> 07:11.849
Say, uh...

-Uh, I'm an Irish cop.

How's the manhunt for me going?

[in English] I am the Vulture,
the pinnacle of man's genius.

09:22.938 --> 09:25.691
You're not my Vulture.
What are you, made of parchment?

Ooh, let me guess.

You were having an espresso

09:42.374 --> 09:44.459
in some old-timey
Leonardo da Vinci dimension,

uh, maybe you could stop making a mess
of the art museum for no reason?

-We're talking about it, aren't we?

-[man] Oh, that's cool.
-[Vulture yells]

10:07.024 --> 10:09.735
[Gwen] I mean, it's more of
a meta commentary on what we call art,

10:09.818 --> 10:12.404
but it's also art.

Who exactly are you supposed to be?

11:01.328 --> 11:02.371
It's classified.

11:02.955 --> 11:04.748
-You're the Blue Panther.
-No.

-No.

-Stop.

-Actually, forget it.

11:20.305 --> 11:22.766
Can you go to any dimension you want
with that watch thing?

11:22.850 --> 11:25.978
-It's much cooler than a watch.
-Okay. Sensitive.

There is a big flying turkey
from the Renaissance

11:28.981 --> 11:31.149

so if you don't mind...

11:31.233 --> 11:32.734
[Miguel] It's all right, kid.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.236
I'll take it from here.

11:34.319 --> 11:36.238
[Gwen] Okay, knock yourself out.

11:36.321 --> 11:37.990
[Miguel] Why are you saying it like that?

11:38.073 --> 11:40.617
-[grunts] You're not funny!
-[Gwen] Eh, I don't know.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.745
[lively music playing]

11:44.329 --> 11:46.999
[Miguel] Been really fun cleaning up
your shocking mess, by the way.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.041
[Gwen] What mess?

11:48.125 --> 11:51.086
-[Miguel] Kingpin's collider.
-What are you guys talking about?

11:51.170 --> 11:52.796
-You shut up.
-None of your business. Nosy.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.631
We saved the multiverse.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.551
[Miguel] You left a hole wide enough
for guys like him

11:57.634 --> 12:00.304
to randomly get shot
into the wrong dimension.

12:01.722 --> 12:04.391
Now I'm stuck putting everybody
back where they belong

12:04.474 --> 12:06.560
before all of time and space collapses.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.604
And don't even get me started
on Doctor Strange

12:08.687 --> 12:11.273
and the little nerd back on Earth-199999.

12:11.356 --> 12:12.441
[Gwen] Who's Doctor Strange?

12:12.524 --> 12:14.693
Sounds like he maybe
shouldn't practise medicine.

12:15.360 --> 12:17.487
-Sorry, captain, can't talk right now.
-Hey! Hey!

12:17.571 --> 12:19.489
[Vulture speaks in Italian]

12:21.116 --> 12:23.493
[Gwen]
So you want me to handle this one or...?

Okay.

-Nah, you gotta say it first.

-Call for backup.
-What?

12:54.358 --> 12:55.442
-Call backup.
-Come on.

12:55.526 --> 12:58.195
-Please just call for--
-I already called her.

Are you, uh...?

13:28.350 --> 13:29.434
Oh, this?

13:29.518 --> 13:32.396
We don't know the sex yet.
My husband wants it to be a surprise.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.816
[laughs] He's really corny. But so hot.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.150
Will you adopt me?

13:37.234 --> 13:38.443
-What?
-What? What?

13:38.527 --> 13:39.903
[Miguel] Guys, can we focus

-What about her?
-No.

13:57.963 --> 13:59.214
-We could use the help.
-No.

13:59.298 --> 14:01.633
-'Cause she called you Dark Garfield?
-No.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.760
-Do you say anything but no?
-No. Yes.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.804
-Why not?
-You know why.

14:08.557 --> 14:10.309
[in English] Enough of this.

from my backpack.

14:21.278 --> 14:22.529
[Miguel] Don't let him out!

14:24.948 --> 14:27.409
He'll disrupt the canon.

-[man] Go to the ground.
-Will you get out of here?

14:42.007 --> 14:43.634
[man] We have you surrounded.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.512
-[Miguel] But I'm a good guy.
-[man] You don't look like a good guy.

14:46.595 --> 14:49.556
[Miguel] You're just gonna have to shut up
and trust me. No!

-Suspect is armed.
-With what? I'm out of webs.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.417
Get down on the ground.

Which is it? Hands in the air
or get down on the ground?

16:42.461 --> 16:44.713
-You're under arrest.
-I just saved a bunch of people!

16:44.796 --> 16:46.548

17:31.009 --> 17:33.846
I've thought about telling you.

17:33.929 --> 17:37.349
But you can see why I didn't want to.
You can see why I didn't wanna tell you.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.394
I didn't murder Peter.

17:40.477 --> 17:43.355
I didn't know it was him.
I didn't have a choice.

17:43.438 --> 17:46.608
How long have you been lying to me?

17:49.278 --> 17:53.866
Can you just not be a cop for a second
and be my dad here and listen to me?

17:55.450 --> 17:57.995
Do you really think I'm a murderer?

18:00.038 --> 18:02.249
You're in this to help people, right?

18:05.169 --> 18:06.170
Right?

18:06.753 --> 18:07.880
Well, so am I.

18:09.506 --> 18:11.967
And the way to help right now
is to listen to me.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.011
Please, Dad.

-What?

-You have the right to an attorney.

on the college conversation, so...

20:34.943 --> 20:38.488
I'm sure he's gonna be here any minute.

20:38.572 --> 20:41.450
He's very serious about his future.

First of all, I'm not even robbing you.
This machine doesn't even belong to you.

-You're the criminal. You're robbing me.

anywhere anymore, being like this.

Can't you act like a regular supervillain
so I can catch you?

I designed my new suit
with some fly ambience down the side.

can I keep lying about who I really am?

is Puerto Rican.

We love you and accept you, even though
you have been lying to us for a year.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.691
[Miles] Maybe in some other universe.

I wasn't the only one.

to be the Prowler.

-Okay.

No, no, no. Go ahead. Take the call.

25:18.810 --> 25:21.605
You turn off your phone in a theatre,
but not when you're fighting me?

25:21.688 --> 25:23.398

-Uh, I'm writing an essay.

There's a bad guy
on the Petersen building.

-Sounds like a slippery slope.
-Just this one time.

27:14.927 --> 27:18.222
And my job is to capture
your person's universe

27:18.305 --> 27:20.140
on this piece of paper.

27:21.725 --> 27:23.727
-That's blank.
-Exactly.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.730
I have no idea who this kid is.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.690
I don't know if he knows.

27:28.774 --> 27:32.319
He's gotta decide if he's going
to commit himself to his future

27:32.402 --> 27:35.572
or whatever he's doing
instead of being here.

27:35.656 --> 27:37.449
Can't have your cake and eat it too.

27:37.533 --> 27:39.368
Unless you bake two cakes.

27:39.451 --> 27:41.161
-Miles?
-Interest in comedy.

27:41.245 --> 27:43.789
-How's this going? College!
-Now, son, what do we always say?

27:43.872 --> 27:45.916
"On time means five minutes early."

27:45.999 --> 27:47.251
I know, I know, I know.

27:47.334 --> 27:51.004
I gotta get back to being a great student,
so can we make this quick?

27:54.424 --> 27:55.300
[Ms Weber] Okay.

27:55.884 --> 27:57.469
Miles's grades are pretty good.

27:57.553 --> 27:58.971
A in AP Physics...

27:59.054 --> 28:00.556
That's my little man.

28:00.639 --> 28:02.850
...and AP Studio Art.

28:02.933 --> 28:04.101
He takes after his uncle.

28:04.184 --> 28:05.978
-A-minus in English.
-She's a tough grader.

28:06.061 --> 28:07.771
And a B in Spanish.

28:07.855 --> 28:09.064
-What?!
-Whoo! Okay.

28:09.147 --> 28:11.692
-Miles! [speaks in Spanish]
-Are you trying to kill your mother?

28:11.775 --> 28:13.902
[speaks in Spanish] Eso no es my fault.

28:13.986 --> 28:16.655
"Esto no es my fault"?
¿Tú estás tomando la clase en Spanglish?

28:16.738 --> 28:18.115
I missed a few classes.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.158
Oh, just a few classes.
Well, what's "a few"?

28:20.242 --> 28:21.702
[Miles] I mean, you know, like...

28:22.578 --> 28:24.288
-Five?
-[in unison] Five?!

28:24.371 --> 28:25.289
Actually, six.

28:25.372 --> 28:26.832
-You're dead.
-A truant.

28:26.915 --> 28:28.375
-Wait.
-[sighs] Takes after his uncle.

28:28.458 --> 28:31.962
-But I just have a lot going on.
-All right. We can still salvage this.

28:32.045 --> 28:33.297
I'm sorry, "salvage"?

28:33.380 --> 28:35.382
Miles has a great story to tell.

28:35.465 --> 28:38.093
Having a story at all seems gross.

28:38.177 --> 28:40.762
-Your name is Miles Morales.
-Correct.

28:40.846 --> 28:43.473
You grew up
in a struggling immigrant family.

28:43.557 --> 28:46.268
I'm from Puerto Rico.
Puerto Rico is part of America.

28:46.351 --> 28:49.438
We own a floor in Brooklyn.
Ah... Struggling? [muttering]

28:49.521 --> 28:52.107
-Doesn't matter. You're all struggling.
-I make captain next week.

28:52.191 --> 28:55.903
Now his dream is to attend
the top physics programme in the nation...

28:55.986 --> 28:59.615
-Whatever it takes, we'll do it.
-...at Princeton University.

29:00.449 --> 29:01.909
In New Jersey?

29:02.618 --> 29:04.703
No, no, no. That's too far.

29:04.786 --> 29:07.122
New Jersey's too far from New York?

29:07.206 --> 29:09.541
There's great schools in Brooklyn.

29:09.625 --> 29:12.336
Mom, Princeton has the best
quantum researchers in the country.

29:12.419 --> 29:13.253
Quantum. Mm-hm.

29:13.337 --> 29:16.215
They're moving electrons
across dimensional thresholds.

29:16.298 --> 29:18.550
-Electrons. Uh-huh.
-They're studying dark matter!

29:18.634 --> 29:20.511
I don't know what any of that means.

29:20.594 --> 29:23.722
I could help figure out
how to travel to other dimensions.

29:23.805 --> 29:26.558
-Yeah, okay.
-That sounds like a really good fake job.

29:26.642 --> 29:30.229
Dad, when you were my age,
you followed your dream

29:30.312 --> 29:33.690
and went out on your own
to start a business with Uncle Aaron.

29:33.774 --> 29:36.151
-Right?
-That's different. We used to--

29:36.235 --> 29:39.613
See, when you were born-- [laughs]
Plus, your mom used to--

29:40.239 --> 29:41.990
Look, life is a journey.

29:42.074 --> 29:45.994
You all got me into this school because
you thought I could do something special.

29:46.078 --> 29:49.081
-[dramatic, pensive music playing]
-And now I think so too.

29:49.164 --> 29:51.667
And the special thing I wanna do is this.

29:52.459 --> 29:54.086
There are people out there

29:54.169 --> 29:56.797
who can literally teach me
the things I wanna learn.

29:57.464 --> 29:59.383
But they aren't all in Brooklyn.

30:06.557 --> 30:07.808
[fist thumps]

30:08.433 --> 30:10.185
That's your story!

30:10.269 --> 30:12.145
Now just stick to the script.

30:12.229 --> 30:13.939
[Jeff] Miles, are you paying attention?

30:14.022 --> 30:15.858
-Miles, pay attention.
-[Spot whoops]

30:15.941 --> 30:18.902
-Ow. That hurt my tailbone.
-[Miles] Are you kidding me?

30:18.986 --> 30:22.239
Ooh. I gotta go. You guys keep talking.
This is all great stuff.

30:22.322 --> 30:24.700
Miles, wait.
Did you order the cake for tonight?

30:24.783 --> 30:28.203
Totally. I'm-- You know, call me--
I gotta go, all right? Bye!

30:28.287 --> 30:30.956
This kid. I swear,
what are we gonna do with him?

30:31.039 --> 30:32.875
[man]
All units, supervillain event in progress.

30:32.958 --> 30:35.210
-I gotta go too.
-What? You're gonna leave too?

30:35.294 --> 30:37.546
He leaves, you leave, everybody leaves.
Why am I here?

30:37.629 --> 30:39.882
I know. I'm so sorry.
But we'll figure it out.

30:40.966 --> 30:41.800
Together.

30:43.844 --> 30:46.805
Wow. Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

30:46.889 --> 30:48.807
-[Ms Weber] He's lying to you.
-Jeff?

30:48.891 --> 30:49.725
Your son.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.728
He's lying. And I think you know it.

30:54.855 --> 30:56.440
How's your essay?

30:56.523 --> 30:59.818
-Marinating. This is part of my process.
-Oh? Oh, really?

30:59.902 --> 31:02.321
-I think your guy got away.
-Thanks, I'm on it.

31:02.404 --> 31:04.114
-You seem really stressed.
-[Miles] I agree.

31:04.198 --> 31:06.909
-You're stretched too thin.
-Yeah, thanks for the tip. [yelps]

31:06.992 --> 31:08.368
-That was bad.
-[Jeff] I know.

31:08.452 --> 31:10.871
-What's really going on with this kid?
-I don't know!

31:10.954 --> 31:12.289
-Oh! Hey!
-[Spot] Boom!

31:12.372 --> 31:14.833
-Spider-Man.
-[Miles] Officer Morales! I mean:

31:14.917 --> 31:17.961
-[in deep voice] Officer Morales.
-[Spot] This is not what it looks like.

31:18.045 --> 31:19.463
-Hey! Hey!
-[Spot] Officer--

31:19.546 --> 31:21.882
My kid goes here, man!

31:21.965 --> 31:22.883
[Spot] This is fun.

31:22.966 --> 31:26.053
I'm on the PTA. You know how many
lemon bars I gotta bake for that?

31:26.136 --> 31:29.223
-[Spot] You left in the middle of a fight.
-[Miles] I did not. It was at the end.

31:29.306 --> 31:31.808
-[Jeff] Are you serious?
-[Spot] It was inconsiderate, super rude.

31:31.892 --> 31:32.726
And a little cocky.

31:32.809 --> 31:35.270
Yeah, you got me agreeing
with the bad guy right now.

31:35.354 --> 31:37.689
[Miles] "Bad guy"?
He's barely a villain of the week.

31:37.773 --> 31:38.774
[Spot] What'd you call me?

31:38.857 --> 31:40.275
-You realise I'm right here.
-Come on!

31:40.359 --> 31:41.777
-[Miles] Everything...
-[Jeff yells]

31:42.694 --> 31:43.695
...is under control.

31:43.779 --> 31:45.405
[lively music playing]

31:47.783 --> 31:49.368
-[Jeff groans] Unbelievable.
-[Spot] Wow.

31:50.285 --> 31:51.995
Of course we'd end up back here.

31:52.079 --> 31:53.705
[Jeff] You know, you are just like my son.

31:53.789 --> 31:58.126
[Miles] I am? I-- [laughs]
That's so silly. Imagine that.

31:58.210 --> 32:00.629
-[Spot] Back where it all started!
-[Miles] Look out!

32:00.712 --> 32:02.631
[dramatic music playing]

32:02.714 --> 32:04.883
[Spot] The crucible of our connection!

32:05.926 --> 32:08.053
[Miles]
Don't try to wow me with big words.

32:08.136 --> 32:10.180
I do the crossword every day.

32:16.478 --> 32:18.856
-[Spot] Is it all coming back to you?
-[Miles] What are you talking about?

32:18.939 --> 32:20.065
[Spot] The creation event.

32:20.607 --> 32:21.608
[Miles] What?

32:22.651 --> 32:23.819
-[cell phone ringing]
-Ah!

32:24.611 --> 32:26.530
-Yeah.
-Hey, we got cut off.

32:26.613 --> 32:30.117
This is our son we're talking about.
Nothing is more important than family.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.994
[suspenseful music playing]

32:32.578 --> 32:36.456
[Jeff yells, then grunts]
I'm kind of in the middle of something.

32:36.540 --> 32:39.459
[Spot grunts] Destiny brought us here.

32:39.543 --> 32:42.421
-You see now, don't you?
-I really don't.

32:42.504 --> 32:44.339
[Spot] I am your nemesis.

32:44.423 --> 32:45.883
Dude, you are not.

32:45.966 --> 32:49.344
You missed.
You can't contain the Spot. Ow!

32:49.428 --> 32:52.055
You really don't remember
what you did to me?

32:52.556 --> 32:55.017
-What I did for you?
-[Miles] Uh... No.

32:55.100 --> 32:56.560
[Spot] I worked at Alchemax.

32:56.643 --> 32:58.854
I ran a test on this collider

32:58.937 --> 33:02.065
that brought a spider here
from another dimension.

33:02.149 --> 33:04.526
-Forty-two.
-[man] Its home dimension.

33:04.610 --> 33:06.904
[Spot] It escaped. And it bit you.

33:08.405 --> 33:11.950
My spider made you Spider-Man.

33:12.034 --> 33:14.328
-What?
-You ran through the cafeteria.

33:14.411 --> 33:16.413
-He took a bagel!
-You hit me with a bagel.

33:16.955 --> 33:17.831
[yells]

33:17.915 --> 33:20.751
I've hit a lot of different villains
with a lot of different food.

33:20.834 --> 33:23.795
[Spot]
You make your flippy, little sassy jokes,

33:23.879 --> 33:24.880
and everyone loves them.

33:25.672 --> 33:29.843
But no one knows what it feels like
to be on the other side of them.

33:29.927 --> 33:31.929
[in deep voice]
I'm just trying to lighten the mood.

33:32.012 --> 33:32.930
I created you.

33:33.764 --> 33:35.182
You created me.

33:35.265 --> 33:36.892
Spider-Man, why did you create that guy?

33:36.975 --> 33:38.685
I didn't. He's talking crazy.

33:38.769 --> 33:41.605
I was in this collider room
when you blew it up!

33:41.688 --> 33:44.691
[dramatic music playing]

33:48.028 --> 33:49.279
[past Spot screaming]

33:50.447 --> 33:51.448
[Spot] Because of you...

33:52.282 --> 33:55.244
I lost my job, my life,

33:55.827 --> 33:57.162
my face!

33:57.246 --> 33:59.248
My family won't even look at me.

33:59.331 --> 34:00.707
I made you into a hero.

34:01.375 --> 34:02.960
You made me into this!

34:03.043 --> 34:06.421
Look at me! You did this to me!

34:06.505 --> 34:09.382
Look at me! I'll make you respect me!

34:09.466 --> 34:11.176
[yelps] Ah! Ow!

34:11.260 --> 34:12.302
[grunts]

34:13.262 --> 34:14.804
I am your neme--

34:19.976 --> 34:21.520
Well, where'd he go?

34:21.603 --> 34:24.063
He kicked his own butt.

34:25.190 --> 34:27.609
[Jeff] You know we're supposed
to catch the bad guys, right?

34:27.693 --> 34:29.277
[Miles] I always do.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.321
-Usually.
-[siren wailing]

34:31.405 --> 34:33.614
-Gutierrez! Get the crane, man.
-[Gutierrez] Yes, sir!

34:33.699 --> 34:35.909
[Jeff groans]
This here is why nobody likes us, man.

34:35.993 --> 34:39.246
-[Miles] "Us"?
-I am trying to do right out here.

34:39.329 --> 34:41.956
-I'm trying too.
-You need to be a better role model.

34:42.040 --> 34:43.375
I'm a great role model.

34:43.458 --> 34:45.252
[siren wails, then stops]

34:47.462 --> 34:50.007
Hey, Gutierrez, you can cancel the crane.

34:52.926 --> 34:54.511
I swear, I'll quit my job!

34:54.594 --> 34:56.804
[pensive, poignant music playing]

34:56.889 --> 35:00.309
-Do you wanna talk about it?
-Are you crazy?!

35:00.392 --> 35:03.478
Well, men of your generation
ignore their mental health too long.

35:03.562 --> 35:05.063
[Jeff] Oh, boy.

35:05.147 --> 35:07.065
What am I even doing?

35:07.149 --> 35:09.776
'Cause no matter what I do,
someone always thinks I'm blowing it.

35:11.904 --> 35:13.030
[Miles] I know the feeling.

35:15.407 --> 35:18.410
So your son.

35:18.493 --> 35:21.705
How's he doing?
You think he's gonna figure it all out?

35:22.956 --> 35:25.209
-Honestly?
-Yeah.

35:25.292 --> 35:27.002
-He's a good kid.
-Yeah?

35:27.085 --> 35:29.505
It's scary.
He says these things that are so smart.

35:29.588 --> 35:31.465
Cool. Well, I should probably--

35:31.548 --> 35:34.676
And then he does these things
that are so stupid.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.721
I just don't want him to mess it up.

35:38.639 --> 35:39.848
Maybe get off the kid's ass.

35:39.932 --> 35:43.060
-I'm sorry, what?
-What? What? I don't know.

35:43.685 --> 35:46.396
And I hate
that he's not being honest with me.

35:46.480 --> 35:48.023
Maybe he's scared to talk to you.

35:48.106 --> 35:50.692
Why would anyone be scared to talk to me?

35:50.776 --> 35:52.694
I don't-- I don't know.

35:52.778 --> 35:55.572
It's just-- You think you're getting
pretty good at being a parent.

35:55.656 --> 35:57.449
You think you got it licked.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.035
And then they go and grow up.

36:01.954 --> 36:04.706
I just don't wanna lose him, you know?

36:12.339 --> 36:16.885
Well, as an objective observer
with no skin in the game,

36:17.845 --> 36:21.765
I say you gotta let him
spread his wings, man.

36:22.599 --> 36:24.685
-Like this.
-Yeah.

36:27.396 --> 36:28.230
I don't know.

36:32.109 --> 36:34.862
If this isn't nice, what is?

36:41.535 --> 36:42.536
I should go.

36:43.829 --> 36:46.081
Yeah, and catch that holes guy.

36:46.164 --> 36:49.543
Don't worry. I don't think
that guy's gonna show his face again.

36:50.502 --> 36:51.336
[Spot] What?

36:52.254 --> 36:53.088
Okay.

36:54.923 --> 36:56.884
I think I kicked myself...

36:56.967 --> 36:58.427
into myself.

36:58.510 --> 37:00.512
[enchanting, pensive music playing]

37:00.596 --> 37:02.222
Well, this is new.

37:02.306 --> 37:05.309
Hello? Hello? Echo, echo. No echo.

37:07.102 --> 37:08.312
Hypothesis:

37:08.979 --> 37:11.231
I'm going to put my head in that hole.

48:30.911 --> 48:31.912
Look at you.

48:32.538 --> 48:33.580
Look at me.

48:35.374 --> 48:36.625
[Miles] Keep the change.

48:36.708 --> 48:38.544
-So this club.
-Look at that dum-dum.

48:38.627 --> 48:40.087
[Miles] What kind of stuff do you do?

48:40.170 --> 48:41.713
[Gwen] Guy in the stripes, ten points.

48:41.797 --> 48:43.882
We're trying to keep the multiverse
from collapsing.

48:43.966 --> 48:45.467
[Miles] I thought we did that already.

48:45.551 --> 48:48.387
[Gwen] Like, last week we had this mission
to some Shakespeare dimension.

48:48.470 --> 48:50.138
-[Miles] What?
-And Hobie and I just, like--

48:50.222 --> 48:52.891
-[Miles] Who's Hobie?
-[Gwen] Oh, my gosh, you would love him.

48:52.975 --> 48:55.018
He lets me crash
in his dimension sometimes.

48:55.102 --> 48:57.312
[Miles] What does that mean,
you stay overnight or...?

48:57.396 --> 49:00.274
[Gwen] Anyway, they're pretty strict
about where I go,

49:00.357 --> 49:02.401
or I really would have come
to see you sooner.

49:02.484 --> 49:05.737
Right. So, uh-- So why'd you come now?

49:06.446 --> 49:08.156
Don't do that. [yelps]

49:11.034 --> 49:13.078
Hey, Gw-- Uh, Gwen?

49:14.037 --> 49:15.080
Where'd you go?

49:16.373 --> 49:18.083
[siren wailing]

49:18.166 --> 49:19.459
Where did she go?

49:25.674 --> 49:27.676
[beeping]

49:31.680 --> 49:33.515
-[Gwen] Ah!
-Oh, hey. There you are.

49:33.599 --> 49:35.350
-What were you doing?
-Waiting for you.

49:38.729 --> 49:41.732
[ominous music playing]

49:42.316 --> 49:44.318
[Spot groaning]

49:48.363 --> 49:50.782
[Miles]
No, it's not the Greek burger place.

49:50.866 --> 49:52.242
[Gwen laughs]

49:52.326 --> 49:54.536
-This is a cool thinking spot.
-[Miles] Right?

49:54.620 --> 49:58.624
Who needs a treadmill when you have
the Williamsburgh Bank Building?

49:58.707 --> 49:59.708
[Gwen laughs]

50:00.584 --> 50:03.837
-["Another Dimension" playing]
-So, uh, you and your dad.

50:04.546 --> 50:05.714
You still haven't talked?

50:06.381 --> 50:09.218
What exactly would we talk about?

50:09.301 --> 50:11.678
"Hey, Dad, how have
the last few months been?

50:12.471 --> 50:14.515
You still think
I murdered my best friend?"

50:17.226 --> 50:18.227
I don't know.

50:18.310 --> 50:21.104
I mean, my parents--
I mean, maybe if I told them--

50:21.188 --> 50:22.022
Don't.

50:22.814 --> 50:24.233
Trust me on that.

50:40.666 --> 50:41.708
Well...

50:43.293 --> 50:46.129
Maybe some things
are supposed to be just for us.

50:47.965 --> 50:48.799
[Gwen] Hm.

50:50.467 --> 50:52.344
That's a nice way to think about it.

50:53.762 --> 50:57.057
I'm just a really
emotionally intelligent guy.

50:57.766 --> 50:59.142
Beyond my years.

50:59.226 --> 51:01.144
[scoffs, then laughs]

51:02.396 --> 51:04.982
It really is always so great
to talk to you.

51:05.065 --> 51:06.900
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

51:08.861 --> 51:12.197
I mean, how many people
can you talk to about this stuff?

51:13.448 --> 51:14.658
You don't even know.

51:15.242 --> 51:18.245
[poignant, pensive music playing]

51:18.996 --> 51:19.997
What?

51:21.832 --> 51:25.460
You're the only friend
I've ever really made after Peter died.

51:26.628 --> 51:29.256
Other than Hobie, right?

51:30.841 --> 51:33.594
-That's different.
-Yeah? How's that?

51:33.677 --> 51:34.761
I don't know.

51:34.845 --> 51:37.890
You and me, it's...

51:37.973 --> 51:39.641
We're the same.

51:42.811 --> 51:45.230
In the important ways, you know?

51:48.317 --> 51:51.820
In every other universe,
Gwen Stacy falls for Spider-Man.

51:58.285 --> 52:01.121
And in every other universe,

52:01.705 --> 52:03.415
it doesn't end well.

52:14.843 --> 52:18.263
Well, there's a first time
for everything, right?

52:18.347 --> 52:20.349
[music turns hopeful]

52:34.821 --> 52:37.366
[laughing and chattering]

52:40.577 --> 52:43.622
-Mmm! Oh, wow. Feelings make me hungry.
-Oh, yeah,

52:43.705 --> 52:46.416
these plátanos are
just deep-fried feelings.

52:48.210 --> 52:49.920
She looks old enough to vote.

52:51.004 --> 52:53.382
I bet she doesn't even speak Spanish.

52:53.465 --> 52:55.008
Well, qué barbaridad.

52:55.884 --> 52:58.303
[Miles] This keeps you from glitching
in other dimensions?

52:58.387 --> 52:59.388
[Gwen] Yeah. Pretty cool.

52:59.471 --> 53:02.724
[Miles] What's it gonna take
for Miguel O'Hara to notice Miles Morales?

53:02.808 --> 53:04.810
[chuckles] I'll put in a good word.

53:04.893 --> 53:07.354
I'm just saying, if I had a watch,
I could come with you.

53:07.437 --> 53:09.731
-Miles, look--
-I did save the multiverse.

53:09.815 --> 53:11.984
It's a really small, elite strike force.

53:12.067 --> 53:14.653
I can turn invisible.
I have, like, electric powers.

53:14.736 --> 53:16.446
-There aren't a lot of slots.
-Think about it.

53:18.365 --> 53:19.616
Ah, right.

53:19.700 --> 53:21.618
Look, if it was up to me, you--

53:21.702 --> 53:23.245
I know. I know, I know.

53:25.873 --> 53:26.874
Oh, no. No, no.

53:26.957 --> 53:29.459
-Don't do that. Miles!
-All right.

53:29.543 --> 53:31.086
-It's, uh, really delicate.
-Geez.

53:32.504 --> 53:35.382
Sorry. I didn't mean to, um, snap.

53:35.465 --> 53:37.467
Okay. All right. I'm sorry.

53:37.551 --> 53:39.219
-Hello! Hi.
-[Gwen and Miles yelp]

53:39.845 --> 53:41.346
-Oh, boy.
-I'm Miles's mom.

53:41.430 --> 53:44.433
Rio! Hi! I've heard so much about you.

53:44.516 --> 53:46.685
You're using my first name. Okay.

53:46.768 --> 53:49.605
This is nice.
We found it in Miles's room, so...

53:49.688 --> 53:53.025
-I guess you must've been there, huh?
-And you must be Jeff.

53:53.108 --> 53:55.068
She called me Jeff.
That's very sweet. "Jeff."

53:55.152 --> 53:56.987
You must mean Lieutenant Morales.

53:57.070 --> 53:59.573
Soon to be Captain Morales.

53:59.656 --> 54:01.033
Ah! Captain.

54:02.159 --> 54:05.495
Gwanda and I are friends from school.

54:05.579 --> 54:08.165
-Yeah, we were just catching up.
-Oh...

54:08.248 --> 54:09.499
Don't take him from me.

54:09.583 --> 54:10.417
Mom.

54:10.501 --> 54:13.712
[laughing] I'm just kidding.
He's grounded, so you can't.

54:13.795 --> 54:15.130
-Don't break his heart.
-Mom!

54:15.214 --> 54:17.633
-Alpha Squad, Zero Red Spider Alert.
-Shoot, I have to go.

54:17.716 --> 54:20.469
-Really?
-Yeah, I forgot to get my steps in.

54:20.552 --> 54:22.971
[laughs nervously]
Really, really wish I could stay longer.

54:23.055 --> 54:24.389
I'm sorry.

54:25.182 --> 54:26.016
Goodbye.

54:30.312 --> 54:31.313
Yeah, bye.

54:37.611 --> 54:40.489
[pensive music playing]

55:06.765 --> 55:09.184
I can hear you being quiet, Mom.

55:10.185 --> 55:11.603
I, um...

55:11.687 --> 55:13.772
I hope I didn't ice your game, man.

55:14.356 --> 55:17.734
No one my age says those words
in that order, Mom.

55:18.527 --> 55:23.991
It's just hard to see my little man
not be my little boy all the time.

55:25.659 --> 55:26.702
Yeah.

55:26.785 --> 55:29.496

55:32.124 --> 55:34.501
Papá, you know you can tell me anything.

55:44.636 --> 55:45.470
Well...

56:05.240 --> 56:06.241
I'm...

56:13.165 --> 56:14.416
I'm sorry I was late.

56:27.930 --> 56:29.973
She seems like a nice girl.

56:32.392 --> 56:34.478
-Is this a trick?
-It's not a trick.

56:35.270 --> 56:36.313
Geez.

56:36.396 --> 56:37.314
What are you--?

56:37.856 --> 56:39.274
Let me fix you. Just...

56:40.484 --> 56:43.695
For years I've been taking care
of this little boy, right?

56:44.530 --> 56:46.573
Making sure he's loved,

56:47.199 --> 56:50.577
that he feels like he belongs
wherever he wants to be.

56:52.246 --> 56:55.749
He wants to go out into the world
and do great big things.

56:56.750 --> 56:58.544
And what I worry about most...

57:00.045 --> 57:02.673
is they won't look out for you like us.

57:04.091 --> 57:06.385
They won't root for you like us.

57:08.887 --> 57:11.598
So here's the deal.

57:12.599 --> 57:14.142
Wherever you go from here,

57:14.226 --> 57:17.229
you have to promise to take care
of that little boy for me.

57:18.105 --> 57:20.357
Make sure he never forgets
where he came from.

57:21.400 --> 57:24.862
And he never doubts that he's loved.

57:26.113 --> 57:31.618
And he never lets anyone at those big,
fancy places he's gonna be in

57:32.244 --> 57:35.038
tell him that he doesn't belong there.

57:36.331 --> 57:39.334
And when he comes home,
and he better come home...

57:41.503 --> 57:42.838
you're gonna be early,

57:43.422 --> 57:46.508
and you're gonna be holding
a normal, nice cake.

57:47.092 --> 57:47.926
Yeah, okay.

57:49.011 --> 57:50.137
You gotta promise, Miles.

57:50.929 --> 57:51.930
I promise.

57:52.681 --> 57:53.682
Just...

-Mm-hm. Okay.

58:05.527 --> 58:08.947

58:11.200 --> 58:12.868
[in English] Now go. Get out of here.

58:16.038 --> 58:17.831
And when you come back,
you're still grounded.

58:17.915 --> 58:18.999
-Ha, ha!
-[laughs]

58:19.082 --> 58:21.418
Yeah, I'm smiling like it's a joke,
but it's true.

Yeah, I figured.

where my nose would've been.

dimensional juice or whatever.

-Shoot.
-Shoot!

with a full-size collider.

for everything you took away from me.

-What?

01:02:02.973 --> 01:02:06.310
He can jump wherever he wants.
He could be a total canon killer.

01:02:06.393 --> 01:02:09.605
You said he was the villain of the week.
Do you know how bad this is for you?

01:02:09.688 --> 01:02:11.899
Every dimension he stops at
has an Alchemax.

01:02:11.982 --> 01:02:13.567
-What's he up to, Gwen?
-I don't know.

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:16.069
[Miles] He's making himself more powerful
so he can beat me.

01:02:16.153 --> 01:02:18.655
Amazing. My star pupil, everyone.

01:02:18.739 --> 01:02:21.283
I'll get him, okay? I can get backup.

01:02:22.159 --> 01:02:23.702
If Miguel finds out I let you come--

01:02:23.785 --> 01:02:26.330
Don't tell Miguel. He'll kick me out and--

01:02:26.914 --> 01:02:28.123
What if he sends me home?

01:02:28.207 --> 01:02:30.083
[suspenseful music playing]

01:02:30.167 --> 01:02:32.503
I got him. Earth-50101.

01:02:33.253 --> 01:02:34.546
What do you wanna do?

01:02:36.924 --> 01:02:38.425
You never made a mistake?

01:02:39.134 --> 01:02:41.011
Never got too close to someone?

01:02:41.094 --> 01:02:42.095
I did.

01:02:43.263 --> 01:02:44.723
But I got over it.

01:02:48.227 --> 01:02:50.646
Alert the local Spider.
Tell him Gwen will meet him there.

01:02:50.729 --> 01:02:51.563
[LYLA] I'm on it.

01:02:51.647 --> 01:02:55.192
-Thank you. I won't let you down again.
-Okay. You're welcome. Shut up.

01:02:56.109 --> 01:02:57.945
You got an hour to fix this.

01:02:59.071 --> 01:03:00.280
Or I can't help you.

01:03:28.517 --> 01:03:29.643
Goodbye, Miles.

01:04:52.768 --> 01:04:54.061
[Spot] You see that? This is incredible.

01:04:54.144 --> 01:04:55.729
-I'm like a new person.
-[Gwen] Where did you go?

01:04:55.812 --> 01:04:57.564
[Spot] In the mirror,
I wouldn't recognise myself.

01:04:57.648 --> 01:05:00.192
-[Gwen] Stay still.
-I'd envy that person I was looking at.

01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:02.569
-[Gwen] I have eyes on the anomaly.
-[Jess] Try getting hands on him.

01:05:02.653 --> 01:05:03.946
Stop hovering. You're hovering.

01:05:04.029 --> 01:05:05.531
Hello, pardon me, locals.

01:05:05.614 --> 01:05:08.242
Wow, four on there. That's very dangerous.

01:05:08.325 --> 01:05:09.409
That looks good.

01:05:09.493 --> 01:05:12.371
-Which way to Alchemax? Oh! [coughs]
-[screaming]

01:05:12.454 --> 01:05:14.164
It's a place with a big collider--

01:05:15.249 --> 01:05:18.126
-Hey, cow guy! "Moo-ve" over!
-[Spot] That's the best you could do?

01:05:18.210 --> 01:05:20.796
-[Miles] Gwen! I'm here to help!
-Miles, are you--?

01:05:20.879 --> 01:05:24.091
[Spot] Whoopsie-daisy.
You weren't expecting that, were you?

01:05:24.174 --> 01:05:27.010
-[Miles] Oh, no!
-[Spot] Neither was I. I'm in the zone!

01:05:27.094 --> 01:05:29.012
[dramatic music playing]

01:05:29.096 --> 01:05:31.557
-[Miles] I got you!
-Did you follow me?

01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:35.519
No, I just saw where you went
and went there without you knowing.

01:05:35.602 --> 01:05:38.814
-You're not supposed to be here!
-What are you talking about? I'm helping--

01:05:40.524 --> 01:05:43.110
No! No, no, no!

01:05:46.238 --> 01:05:47.447
Whoa!

01:05:47.948 --> 01:05:49.491
I shouldn't have ever come to see you.

01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:51.034
Dang.

01:06:00.043 --> 01:06:01.420
[Pav] Hey, who's the new guy?

01:06:01.503 --> 01:06:04.381
Hey, Pav.
He's Miles and he wasn't invited.

01:06:04.464 --> 01:06:07.050
[Pav] Oh!
You weren't invited and you came anyway?

01:06:07.134 --> 01:06:09.720
-Right?
-New guy must be in love with you.

01:06:09.803 --> 01:06:10.846
-[Gwen] Okay, whoa.
-[Miles] No.

01:06:10.929 --> 01:06:13.015
-I'm not.
-I'm very good at reading people.

01:06:13.098 --> 01:06:14.474
-[Gwen] He's not.
-[Miles] Who are you?

01:06:14.558 --> 01:06:16.185
-[Pav] Glad you asked, new guy.
-I'm not a new guy.

01:06:16.268 --> 01:06:19.771
My name is Pavitr Prabhakar,
and for the past six months--

01:06:19.855 --> 01:06:21.815
Six? And even he got a watch?

01:06:21.899 --> 01:06:24.818
-Yeah, uh...
-Being Spider-Man is so easy.

01:06:24.902 --> 01:06:26.111
I wake up, skip the workout,

01:06:26.195 --> 01:06:28.864
because I'm naturally buff
and I don't wanna get too big.

01:06:28.947 --> 01:06:30.616
Do almost nothing with my amazing hair.

01:06:30.699 --> 01:06:32.117
You don't use any product at all?

01:06:32.201 --> 01:06:33.911
Just coconut oil, prayer, some genetics.

01:06:33.994 --> 01:06:36.747
Then I swing by school.
Don't really have to try, but I do anyway.

01:06:36.830 --> 01:06:38.665
Fight a few bad guys,
feed a few street dogs,

01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:40.959
quick break for a cup of chai
with my Maya Auntie--

01:06:41.043 --> 01:06:43.504
-I love chai tea.
-What did you just say?

01:06:43.587 --> 01:06:44.546
"Chai tea"?

01:06:44.630 --> 01:06:47.758
"Chai" means "tea," bro.
You're saying "tea" tea.

01:06:47.841 --> 01:06:50.302
Would I ask you for a "coffee" coffee
with "cream" cream?

01:06:50.385 --> 01:06:51.220
I'm so sorry.

01:06:51.303 --> 01:06:54.181
[Pav] Then I hang out
with my girlfriend, Gayatri.

01:06:54.264 --> 01:06:56.558
She's an extremely classy teenager.

01:06:56.642 --> 01:06:58.852
Hey, girl. Tonight, I was thinking--

01:06:58.936 --> 01:07:01.063
Hello, Police Inspector Singh.

01:07:01.146 --> 01:07:03.148
This is your daughter. I do not know her.

01:07:03.232 --> 01:07:07.319
To top it off, I live in the best possible
Spider-Man city, Mumbattan.

01:07:07.402 --> 01:07:10.447
Quick tour. This is where the traffic is,
this is where the traffic is.

01:07:10.531 --> 01:07:13.951
Traffic here too. This is where
the British stole all of our stuff. Whoa!

01:07:16.828 --> 01:07:18.121
-[Spot] Hello, Spider-Man.
-[Gwen] Hi.

01:07:18.205 --> 01:07:19.623
-[Pav] Hey.
-[Spot] Not you.

01:07:19.706 --> 01:07:21.083
[Gwen] You talking to him or me or him?

01:07:21.166 --> 01:07:22.876
-[Miles] Think he means me.
-[Spot] Yeah. Him.

01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.628
[Miles] I got this, guys.

01:07:24.711 --> 01:07:26.255
-Huh?
-Wow. How are you?

01:07:26.338 --> 01:07:29.758
-[dramatic music playing]
-Can you tell I levelled up my game?

01:07:29.842 --> 01:07:32.219
I'm on a journey of self-improvement.

01:07:32.302 --> 01:07:33.971
[Pav] And you came to India.

01:07:34.054 --> 01:07:37.474
That's a Western culture cliché.
Don't Eat, Pray, Love me, bro.

01:07:37.558 --> 01:07:38.892
I did not mean it like that.

01:07:38.976 --> 01:07:41.520
Let me guess, you're gonna ask me
about saffron and cardamom

01:07:41.603 --> 01:07:44.064
and naan bread,
which is the same as saying "bread" bread,

01:07:44.147 --> 01:07:45.816
which is the same as saying "chai tea."

01:07:45.899 --> 01:07:47.860
-[Spot] Oh, I love chai tea.
-[Pav] No!

01:07:49.278 --> 01:07:52.781
[Miles] Come on, man! I think maybe
we got off on the wrong foot.

01:07:52.865 --> 01:07:54.074
Let's just talk about this.

01:07:54.157 --> 01:07:57.744
Fine. You made me feel empty,
like I had a hole inside of me.

01:07:57.828 --> 01:07:58.954
[Spot] We all have holes.

01:07:59.788 --> 01:08:02.749
But now I found out
what to fill that hole up with.

01:08:02.833 --> 01:08:04.168
More holes!

01:08:04.251 --> 01:08:06.003
[Miles] That doesn't make any sense!

01:08:06.086 --> 01:08:07.045
[Spot] It will.

01:08:07.713 --> 01:08:09.131
I'm okay. I'm good.

01:08:09.214 --> 01:08:10.632
-Don't worry.
-[Gwen] We won't.

01:08:10.716 --> 01:08:12.718
This romantic tension is so palpable.

01:08:12.801 --> 01:08:14.178
If Spot gets more holes...

01:08:14.261 --> 01:08:16.470
-[Pav] Will they, won't they?
-...he'll be unstoppable!

01:08:16.555 --> 01:08:18.307
-We can't let him get to--
-[Gwen] Alchemax?

01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:20.809
[Pav]
See? How can you guys even concentrate?

01:08:20.893 --> 01:08:22.310
[people scream]

01:08:22.394 --> 01:08:24.062
Hey, does he know about Hobie?

01:08:24.145 --> 01:08:27.482
-What should I know about Hobie?
-Oh, looks like he did not know.

01:08:29.984 --> 01:08:31.486

Go away. Go away.
See you later. Thanks for coming.

01:08:37.033 --> 01:08:39.703
[Pav] Would you please deactivate
this strong barrier?

01:08:39.786 --> 01:08:42.663
[man] It can't be turned off
until the collider sequence is complete.

01:08:42.747 --> 01:08:45.042
The collider sequence? Oh, man.

01:08:47.586 --> 01:08:50.171
-[Gwen] You need to stop!
-[Miles] You don't know what you're doing!

01:08:50.255 --> 01:08:53.175
[Spot] I'm about to be so much more
than a villain of the week.

01:08:53.258 --> 01:08:56.929
I'm sorry I called you that, okay?
You're a great villain.

01:08:57.011 --> 01:08:58.388

Great. Anyone got any ideas?

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.611
[Pav]
Oh, I have so many, but none for this.

01:09:13.362 --> 01:09:16.281
Stand back.
I've been working on something new.

01:09:28.377 --> 01:09:31.087
-[Pav] How long does this usually take?
-[Miles] Just give me a second.

01:09:31.171 --> 01:09:33.631
Do you want us to do something,
or do we just stand here?

01:09:33.715 --> 01:09:35.300
Are you charging it, or--?

01:09:35.384 --> 01:09:37.344
No. I'm absorbing it
so I can shoot it back.

01:09:37.426 --> 01:09:39.638
-[Gwen] Looks like you're charging.
-[Pav] Does this have a name?

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:42.808
[Miles] Hold your questions
until I'm done breaking this!

01:09:42.890 --> 01:09:44.142
Just let me do this!

01:09:44.225 --> 01:09:45.310
[Hobie] Oi, oi!

["On The Run" playing]

01:09:58.073 --> 01:10:00.200
-Hobie!
-[Pav] Hobie, my guy!

-[Miles] Hobie?
-[Spot] Look at that, another one.

01:10:01.910 --> 01:10:04.413
I love how many different variations
of you guys there are.

01:10:04.496 --> 01:10:08.125
-Man-like, Pav! Big stepper! Yeah, mate!
-What's this dude saying?

01:10:08.208 --> 01:10:11.336
[Pav] It's English for "We get
along great, and we're close friends."

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:12.921
Is this the younger from 1610?

01:10:13.005 --> 01:10:14.256
Do you understand this guy?

01:10:14.339 --> 01:10:16.008
[Pav]
Hobie, thanks for breaking the shield!

01:10:16.091 --> 01:10:17.384
[Miles] I loosened it.

01:10:17.467 --> 01:10:20.470
Bit of advice.
Use the palm, not just your fingers.

01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:23.390
What's up with your suit?
Is he bleeding from his armpits?

01:10:23.473 --> 01:10:24.641
[Gwen] Miles, Hobie. Hobie, Miles.

01:10:24.725 --> 01:10:27.978
Hi. I've never heard of you
because Gwen barely ever mentions you.

01:10:28.061 --> 01:10:30.981
A'ight, my name's Hobie, Hobie Brown.
I was bitten by a--

01:10:31.064 --> 01:10:32.733
Wouldn't you like to know?
You know what I mean?

01:10:32.816 --> 01:10:36.278
For the last three years, I've been
the one and only-- Wait, wait, wait.

01:10:36.361 --> 01:10:38.488
You think I'm gonna show you
my secret identity? Come out of it.

01:10:38.572 --> 01:10:42.117
That is, when I'm not playing shows,
antagonizing fascists,

01:10:42.201 --> 01:10:44.995
staging unpermitted political actions
slash performance-art pieces,

01:10:45.078 --> 01:10:47.289
or having a laugh at the pub
with the mandem.

01:10:47.372 --> 01:10:49.541
I'm not a role model.
I was briefly a runway model.

01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:52.461
I hate the a.m. I hate the PM.
I hate labels.

01:10:52.544 --> 01:10:54.588
I'm not a hero
because calling yourself a hero

01:10:54.671 --> 01:10:57.549
makes you a self-mythologizing,
narcissistic autocrat.

01:10:57.633 --> 01:10:59.259
Come on! I thought you hated labels.

01:10:59.343 --> 01:11:01.345
[Hobie] Gwendy, you left your jumper
around my place.

01:11:01.428 --> 01:11:03.388
-What's a jumper?
-[Pav] It's a sweater.

01:11:03.472 --> 01:11:06.308
-How many sweaters do you have?
-That's not mine, I'm sure.

01:11:06.391 --> 01:11:08.602
-[Hobie] And your toothbrush.
-[Miles] Wait, what?

01:11:08.685 --> 01:11:10.604
-[Pav yells]
-[Hobie] Are those my Chucks?

01:11:12.898 --> 01:11:15.526
-[Spot] Y'all make a heck of a team.
-[Hobie] I don't believe in teams.

01:11:15.609 --> 01:11:16.652
[Miles] Aren't you in a band?

01:11:16.735 --> 01:11:18.111
I don't believe in consistency.

01:11:18.862 --> 01:11:20.030
This guy's killing me.

01:11:22.157 --> 01:11:23.659
This is gonna be good for us, Spider-Man.

01:11:25.202 --> 01:11:28.038
You and me, we're finally
gonna live up to our potential.

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:30.707
You'll finally have
a villain worth fighting.

01:11:30.791 --> 01:11:32.709
And I won't be just a joke to you!

01:11:35.754 --> 01:11:37.673
[dramatic music playing]

01:11:42.636 --> 01:11:43.762
[Miles] You're not a joke!

01:11:43.846 --> 01:11:44.930
-Right, gang?
-[Gwen] Absolutely.

01:11:45.013 --> 01:11:47.057
-[Pav] Completely unamusing!
-[Hobie] I don't believe in comedy!

01:11:47.766 --> 01:11:48.767
Just kidding!

01:11:48.851 --> 01:11:51.186
[Miles]
See? No one here thinks you're a joke!

01:11:51.270 --> 01:11:53.772
-[Spot] They won't after this.
-[Miles] No!

01:11:59.862 --> 01:12:01.905
Wow. That was another easy adventure
for Spider-Man.

01:12:01.989 --> 01:12:03.824
-[Gwen] No, no, no!
-[Miles] No, no, no!

01:12:03.907 --> 01:12:05.117
[all yelling]

01:12:21.091 --> 01:12:23.594
I'm coming!

01:12:32.561 --> 01:12:33.770
[Miles] What was that?

01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:37.941
[Spot] Our future.

01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:44.406
I'm gonna take everything from you,
like you took everything from me.

01:12:46.617 --> 01:12:47.618
What?

01:12:47.701 --> 01:12:51.205
[Spot] See you back home, Spider-Man.

01:12:52.039 --> 01:12:54.917
[dramatic music playing]

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.919
Miles. Miles!

01:12:57.002 --> 01:12:58.462
You okay? We gotta go.

01:12:58.545 --> 01:13:01.173
[Hobie] Oi, oi, liven up, mate.
No time to get dizzy.

01:13:05.427 --> 01:13:07.221
[Pav] Everyone, chalo, chalo!

01:13:10.557 --> 01:13:12.684
[people screaming]

01:13:20.567 --> 01:13:23.820
We'll clear the path.
You slow down that building.

01:13:23.904 --> 01:13:25.989
[Hobie] I'll do it.
But not because you told me to.

01:13:34.206 --> 01:13:35.332
[man] Everybody, run!

01:13:35.415 --> 01:13:38.043
[tense, dramatic music playing]

01:13:38.877 --> 01:13:39.795
[both grunting]

01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:53.767
Watch out!

01:13:58.939 --> 01:14:01.066
[dramatic music playing]

01:14:17.583 --> 01:14:19.585
[people screaming]

01:14:30.512 --> 01:14:31.889
Gayatri!

01:14:32.472 --> 01:14:34.308
Gayatri! No!

01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:36.226
[suspenseful music playing]

01:14:37.728 --> 01:14:38.687
[grunting]

01:14:43.984 --> 01:14:44.985
[LYLA] Gwen, heads up.

01:14:45.068 --> 01:14:47.029
Markers are predicting
an incoming canon event.

01:14:47.112 --> 01:14:48.322
So tread carefully.

01:14:49.114 --> 01:14:49.948
I'm on it.

01:14:51.742 --> 01:14:53.202
Somebody, help!

01:14:53.285 --> 01:14:55.120
-Hurry, everyone! This way, quickly!
-[girl] Help!

01:14:55.204 --> 01:14:57.414
[speaking in Hindi]

01:14:58.415 --> 01:14:59.791
[grunting]

01:15:01.627 --> 01:15:03.045
Inspector Singh!

01:15:06.882 --> 01:15:07.925
[passengers scream]

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.135
I can do both!

01:15:13.972 --> 01:15:16.183
-[Miles] I got him, I got him!
-[Gwen] Miles!

01:15:16.266 --> 01:15:18.519
Don't worry.
Thread the needle, ring the bell, right?

01:15:18.602 --> 01:15:21.021
-It's too dangerous.
-I'll be okay, I promise.

01:15:21.104 --> 01:15:22.314
Miles!

01:15:22.397 --> 01:15:24.691
[dramatic music playing]

01:15:33.534 --> 01:15:34.618
[Gwen] Miles!

01:15:38.455 --> 01:15:39.498
No! No.

01:15:48.215 --> 01:15:49.716
[Miles grunts]

01:15:51.677 --> 01:15:52.886
You're all right.

01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:54.304
I promised.

01:15:57.975 --> 01:15:59.476
[passengers chattering]

01:16:00.978 --> 01:16:03.021
[Pav] Are you okay? I was so worried.

01:16:03.105 --> 01:16:06.942
I mean, you seem like a nice young woman
that I do not know.

01:16:07.025 --> 01:16:07.985
[speaks in Hindi]

01:16:08.068 --> 01:16:09.444
Gayatri!

01:16:13.949 --> 01:16:15.367
Not bad, right?

01:16:16.869 --> 01:16:18.662
[beeping]

01:16:19.288 --> 01:16:20.122
Right.

01:16:22.124 --> 01:16:24.168
[in English]
I've never seen him so emotional.

01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:25.419
[in English] Excellent job.

01:16:36.305 --> 01:16:40.142
Man-like, Miles! My guy!

01:16:40.225 --> 01:16:42.978
-[dramatic music playing]
-[crowd cheering and applauding]

01:16:43.061 --> 01:16:44.062
[Pav] Easy.

01:16:51.862 --> 01:16:53.363
So, what do you think?

01:16:54.656 --> 01:16:55.949
What I always think.

01:16:56.950 --> 01:16:57.951
You're amazing.

01:16:59.536 --> 01:17:02.873
We make a good team. Yeah?

01:17:04.041 --> 01:17:04.875
Yeah.

01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:07.211
[rumbling]

01:17:07.294 --> 01:17:10.172
[ominous music playing]

01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:12.925
[Pav] Guys, what's that?

01:17:14.301 --> 01:17:15.886
[Hobie] It's a metaphor for capitalism.

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:19.431
[Gwen] It's a lot worse than that.

01:17:26.605 --> 01:17:28.774
Okay, guys, secure the area,
clear all civilians,

01:17:28.857 --> 01:17:30.984
and let's contain this quantum hole.

01:17:31.068 --> 01:17:33.946
Hey, I'm Miles.
We met before, when I was invisible.

01:17:34.029 --> 01:17:35.405
I know who you are.

01:17:39.034 --> 01:17:40.869
Is everything going to be okay?

01:17:49.503 --> 01:17:51.046
Okay, let me explain.

01:17:51.129 --> 01:17:52.881
Miguel wants you back at HQ.

01:17:52.965 --> 01:17:55.175
-Miles was just about to head out.
-All of you.

01:17:55.259 --> 01:17:59.847
-I don't follow orders, neither does he.
-I'm invited to HQ? Whoo!

01:17:59.930 --> 01:18:02.891
[dramatic music playing]

01:18:14.111 --> 01:18:16.655
How are you even cooler under your mask?

01:18:16.738 --> 01:18:18.323
I was this cool the whole time.

01:18:34.756 --> 01:18:36.383
Hey, over here.

01:18:42.556 --> 01:18:44.725
Yo, this place is wild.

01:18:44.808 --> 01:18:47.144
-[Jess] Any sign of Spot?
-[Malala] Let me ask.

01:18:47.227 --> 01:18:48.645
Anybody spot Spot?

01:18:48.729 --> 01:18:51.648
-Oh, so funny. Anybody else got jokes?
-Now that you mention it.

01:18:51.732 --> 01:18:54.943
[Gwen] Well, you know what they say,
we need to run a spot check.

01:18:55.027 --> 01:18:58.071
-[Spider-Beings chattering]
-[Miles] This is unbelievable.

01:18:58.155 --> 01:19:00.199
-This is the lobby.
-Oh.

01:19:00.782 --> 01:19:03.911
Welcome to Spider-Society.

01:19:03.994 --> 01:19:06.997
[dramatic music continues]

01:19:13.378 --> 01:19:14.922
It's a bit much, innit?

01:19:15.005 --> 01:19:17.549
[Miles] What happened to that small,
elite strike team?

01:19:17.633 --> 01:19:19.343
A lot of these are part-time.

01:19:20.886 --> 01:19:24.723
Gwendy, how much have you told him, hm?
About his place in all this?

01:19:24.806 --> 01:19:25.641
A little.

01:19:27.559 --> 01:19:29.436
-Maybe not enough.
-Here.

01:19:30.729 --> 01:19:31.813
My own watch!

01:19:31.897 --> 01:19:34.650
It's a day pass.
This just keeps you from...

01:19:34.733 --> 01:19:35.817
[grunting]

01:19:35.901 --> 01:19:36.902
...doing that.

01:19:36.985 --> 01:19:38.612
[Spider-Soldiers grunting]

01:19:38.695 --> 01:19:40.656
-[Peter] Hey, Gwen.
-Hey, Peter.

01:19:40.739 --> 01:19:41.823
Hey, I'm Miles.

01:19:41.907 --> 01:19:43.575
-[Peters] Hey, Gwen.
-Hey, Peters.

01:19:43.659 --> 01:19:44.660
I'm a new recruit.

01:19:44.743 --> 01:19:48.497
Peter, take a team to the transport deck
to help deal with this Spot mess.

01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:51.208
-[honks horn]
-I wouldn't call it a mess.

01:19:51.291 --> 01:19:53.502
-More like a success in progress.
-Ben, I need--

01:19:53.585 --> 01:19:57.422
Sorry, I can't talk right now.
I'm thinking about my past.

01:19:57.506 --> 01:19:59.299
Actually, we need you here
for some reason.

01:19:59.383 --> 01:20:02.928
[yells]
That was a particularly harrowing memory.

01:20:03.011 --> 01:20:04.096
-Is he okay?
-[neighs]

01:20:04.179 --> 01:20:06.849
-Ah!
-Howdy. Name's Web-Slinger.

01:20:06.932 --> 01:20:10.561
-Why does the horse need a mask?
-[Web-Slinger] To conceal her face.

01:20:10.644 --> 01:20:12.437
Giddy up!

01:20:12.521 --> 01:20:15.148
-[yelling]
-[Miles] Who is in these laser cages?

01:20:15.232 --> 01:20:17.234
Anomalies. Folks who wound up
in the wrong dimension.

01:20:17.317 --> 01:20:19.111
[Jess]
We kick their butts and send them home.

01:20:19.194 --> 01:20:20.571
They're not very interesting.

01:20:20.654 --> 01:20:22.739
-We got a bunch of Doc Ocks.
-That's interesting.

01:20:22.823 --> 01:20:25.409
A Moosterio. Ms Sterio.

01:20:25.492 --> 01:20:27.286
-Video game guy.
-[Miles] I love video games!

01:20:27.369 --> 01:20:29.705
-Another video game guy.
-Are you talking to me?

01:20:29.788 --> 01:20:30.914
Typeface.

01:20:30.998 --> 01:20:33.709
-Go to Helvetica, Spider-Man!
-Bold.

01:20:33.792 --> 01:20:36.503
An interesting Kraven, a boring Rhino.

01:20:36.587 --> 01:20:37.629
A Prowler.

01:20:37.713 --> 01:20:39.548
-Prowler?
-[Gwen] Not your Prowler.

01:20:40.841 --> 01:20:41.675
Hey.

01:20:42.885 --> 01:20:43.719
Hey.

01:20:46.805 --> 01:20:49.433
-It's rude to stare.
-Caught that one myself.

01:20:49.516 --> 01:20:51.393
-I slipped.
-You? I did all the work.

01:20:51.476 --> 01:20:53.312
How many missions
have you been on together?

01:20:53.395 --> 01:20:55.105
-Not that many.
-Couple dozen.

01:20:55.189 --> 01:20:56.899
That's cool. Sorry.

01:20:56.982 --> 01:20:59.359
[pensive music playing]

01:20:59.443 --> 01:21:02.571
-I'm Spider-Man.
-Oh, no way! All of us are.

01:21:02.654 --> 01:21:05.574
-Can we just keep moving?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you?

01:21:05.657 --> 01:21:07.284
I'm an avatar.

01:21:07.367 --> 01:21:09.286
My body is back in my parents' dimension,

01:21:09.369 --> 01:21:11.622
chilling in a gaming chair
and eating Fritos.

01:21:11.705 --> 01:21:13.707
[woman] Right, because you don't listen.

01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:15.250
Here is better.

01:21:15.334 --> 01:21:16.335
I hear that.

01:21:18.879 --> 01:21:19.963
What does that do?

01:21:20.047 --> 01:21:21.381
Apart from having a great name?

01:21:21.465 --> 01:21:23.759
-The Go Home Machine.
-What'd I say, eh?

01:21:23.842 --> 01:21:24.843
I voted against it.

01:21:24.927 --> 01:21:27.846
[Margo] It detects whatever dimension
your DNA is from

01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:29.181
and sends you there.

01:21:29.264 --> 01:21:31.725
It's super humane and not creepy.

01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:35.187
[Margo] See you, dawg. Don't come back.

01:21:37.064 --> 01:21:39.566
We should go.
We don't wanna keep the boss waiting.

01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:40.776
-See you around?
-Let's go!

01:21:40.859 --> 01:21:43.070
-Good luck out there, man.
-Okay, bye!

01:21:43.153 --> 01:21:44.404
[LYLA] Miguel sounds hangry.

01:21:44.488 --> 01:21:46.823
[Jess] He likes those empanadas
from the cafeteria.

01:21:46.907 --> 01:21:47.950
Don't ask me why.

01:21:48.033 --> 01:21:49.618
[pensive music playing]

01:21:49.701 --> 01:21:51.495
My name is Miguel O'Hara.

01:21:53.664 --> 01:21:56.458
I'm this dimension's one
and only Spider-Man.

01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:59.920
At least, I was.

01:22:03.465 --> 01:22:05.217
But I'm not like the others.

01:22:07.594 --> 01:22:10.097
I don't always like what I have to do.

01:22:11.098 --> 01:22:13.517
But I know I have to be the one to do it.

01:22:14.726 --> 01:22:17.521
I've given up too much to stop now.

01:22:20.023 --> 01:22:21.066
Whoa, yo.

01:22:22.609 --> 01:22:24.069
Bet this doesn't even do anything.

01:22:24.152 --> 01:22:26.613
[Miles] Maybe it did
before you ripped it out of a wall.

01:22:26.697 --> 01:22:29.867
It's propaganda, bruv.
To distract you from the truth.

01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:31.660
[sighs] And what's that?

01:22:31.743 --> 01:22:34.538
I ain't got a Scooby Doo.
That's what they want.

01:22:39.376 --> 01:22:42.379
-Why you wanna be part of this lot?
-[Miles] To get a watch.

01:22:42.462 --> 01:22:44.715
-Make your own watch.
-Pssh.

01:22:44.798 --> 01:22:47.301
Bet you got a nice setup, eh?
Nice parents.

01:22:47.384 --> 01:22:50.470
They're fine.
I mean, we got in a fight, but...

01:22:51.471 --> 01:22:53.891
They just want what's best for me, so...

01:22:53.974 --> 01:22:56.476
-That's a bloody shame.
-Why?

01:22:57.436 --> 01:22:59.396
'Cause you're not ready
for everybody else.

01:23:01.064 --> 01:23:03.567
-[girl] We did it this time!
-[man] Okay, okay, mija.

01:23:03.650 --> 01:23:06.653
[dramatic music playing]

01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:09.615
Good job.

01:23:11.825 --> 01:23:15.787
[Hobie] Listen to me, bruv. Whole point
of being Spider-Man is your independence.

01:23:15.871 --> 01:23:17.706
Being your own boss.
You don't need all this.

01:23:17.789 --> 01:23:21.084
-Then why are you here?
-Looking out for my drummer, is all.

01:23:21.168 --> 01:23:22.878
I want to be in a band. I--

01:23:22.961 --> 01:23:26.507
I wanna see my friends,
and I need a watch to do that.

01:23:26.590 --> 01:23:27.925
Guys, come on.

01:23:28.008 --> 01:23:29.510
All right. Squashed.

01:23:31.011 --> 01:23:33.263
Don't enlist till you know
what war you're fighting.

01:23:56.703 --> 01:23:58.080
[whispers] Yeah, I know it's slow.

01:23:58.622 --> 01:23:59.998
But it's his thing.

01:24:01.583 --> 01:24:04.753
[in normal voice]
Miguel O'Hara, meet Miles Morales.

01:24:04.837 --> 01:24:07.130
Hey! [speaks in Spanish]

01:24:07.214 --> 01:24:08.507
[in English] I speak Spanish.

01:24:09.925 --> 01:24:11.260
[speaks in Spanish]

01:24:13.011 --> 01:24:14.012
[speaks in Spanish]

01:24:17.766 --> 01:24:20.310
-[in English] I'm excited to get going.
-[in English] Oh. Great.

01:24:20.394 --> 01:24:22.563
-I have new ideas on how to catch Spot.
-Oh. Wow. Uh-huh.

01:24:22.646 --> 01:24:25.482
[Miles] He just wants to be
taken seriously, like we all do. Whoa!

01:24:25.774 --> 01:24:27.192
He's worried about Spot.

01:24:27.276 --> 01:24:28.610
I'll worry about Spot!

01:24:28.694 --> 01:24:31.613
-What did I do?
-Miguel! It's not his fault.

01:24:31.697 --> 01:24:34.199
-Fault? Hold up.
-You blew another hole in the multiverse!

01:24:34.283 --> 01:24:37.744
-He doesn't know any better.
-I do know what-- Not know what?

01:24:37.828 --> 01:24:39.329
But you did, Gwen.

01:24:40.038 --> 01:24:42.958
And you--
I'm just gonna try to ignore you.

01:24:43.041 --> 01:24:45.002
-I just can't. I can't even.
-I ain't even here.

01:24:45.836 --> 01:24:46.879
Or here.

01:24:46.962 --> 01:24:49.464
-What's happening?
-[Peter] Hey, Miguel!

01:24:49.548 --> 01:24:52.092
Come on, go easy on the kid.

01:24:52.176 --> 01:24:55.554
-He had a terrible teacher.
-[uplifting music playing]

01:24:55.637 --> 01:24:57.055
He had no chance.

01:24:57.139 --> 01:24:58.891
-Peter!
-Oh, boy.

01:24:58.974 --> 01:25:01.435
Humbling-Reality Spider-Man has arrived.

01:25:01.518 --> 01:25:02.936
-Miles!
-Dude!

01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:06.732
Don't be afraid of my friend Miguel.
He just looks scary. He's got no bite.

01:25:06.815 --> 01:25:09.193
-[groans] Peter.
-You're growing up on me. You look great.

01:25:09.276 --> 01:25:12.905
-You look solid, you know. You look good.
-Define "solid."

01:25:12.988 --> 01:25:14.948
What happened?
You bleeding from the armpits?

01:25:15.032 --> 01:25:17.618
-Peter, you--
-Don't worry, we'll get you a new suit.

01:25:17.701 --> 01:25:19.369
Peter, you gotta tell them--

01:25:19.453 --> 01:25:21.872
-Wait. What is that?
-[Peter] Mayday!

01:25:21.955 --> 01:25:23.332
-You have a baby!
-I have a baby.

01:25:23.415 --> 01:25:24.416
This is crazy.

01:25:24.499 --> 01:25:26.877
Don't forget to keep
your little day pass on, honey.

01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:29.671
Oh, you have one too.
I didn't know they made those for adults.

01:25:29.755 --> 01:25:32.841
-Give me a second. Mayday!
-The kid's an anarchist.

01:25:32.925 --> 01:25:35.427
I'm coming up to get you.
Here I come. Don't move.

01:25:35.511 --> 01:25:37.095
[grumbling in Spanish]

01:25:37.179 --> 01:25:40.599
I got you. I knew I was gonna regret
making her that web shooter.

01:25:40.682 --> 01:25:42.684
I shouldn't have done it.
That's an actual mistake.

01:25:43.810 --> 01:25:45.646
-You wanna see pictures?
-She's right there.

01:25:45.729 --> 01:25:48.065
-Look at this pic!
-Oh, you've got them.

01:25:48.148 --> 01:25:49.525
-She's incredible.
-Yup.

01:25:49.608 --> 01:25:52.361
This is her funny face.
That's her mad face.

01:25:52.444 --> 01:25:54.238
This one is the studious one.

01:25:54.321 --> 01:25:56.990
Watch out,
the next one you're gonna crack up.

01:25:57.074 --> 01:26:00.035
Miguel's gonna die.
Miguel, look at this one.

01:26:00.118 --> 01:26:02.120
I'm trying to hold
a serious adult conversation.

01:26:02.204 --> 01:26:03.997
You're the only Spider-Man
who isn't funny.

01:26:04.081 --> 01:26:06.542
-We're supposed to be funny.
-The fate of the multiverse--

01:26:06.625 --> 01:26:08.335
You always lose me with that.

01:26:08.418 --> 01:26:12.589
You say, "The fate of the multiverse,"
and my brain dies.

01:26:14.174 --> 01:26:15.843
Do you guys smell that?
Mayday took a crap.

01:26:15.926 --> 01:26:17.386
-Yup. She's a Parker.
-[Miguel] Miles.

01:26:17.469 --> 01:26:19.179
That's what happens
when a Parker eats an avocado.

01:26:19.263 --> 01:26:21.306
-You disrupted a canon event.
-Canon event?

01:26:21.390 --> 01:26:24.268
The kid wasn't thinking.
That's not how he works.

01:26:24.351 --> 01:26:25.394
That's insulting.

01:26:25.477 --> 01:26:28.105
Taking a crap on the establishment.
I salute you.

01:26:28.188 --> 01:26:30.649
Wait, what are you upset about?
I saved those people.

01:26:30.732 --> 01:26:32.276
And that's the problem.

01:26:32.359 --> 01:26:34.236
[ominous music playing]

01:26:34.319 --> 01:26:37.197
-LYLA, do the thing.
-Huh? What thing?

01:26:37.281 --> 01:26:40.117
What do you mean, "What thing?"
The information-explainy thing.

01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.201
Okay.

01:26:47.624 --> 01:26:48.917
What's this?

01:26:49.793 --> 01:26:52.379
This is everything.

01:26:52.462 --> 01:26:55.465
[dramatic music playing]

01:26:57.801 --> 01:26:59.803
Can you be more specific?

01:26:59.887 --> 01:27:02.139
Can you not talk for a second?

01:27:02.222 --> 01:27:03.307
[Miles] Yeah, yeah, I--

01:27:04.266 --> 01:27:05.309
[Miguel] And this here?

01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.811
This is all of us.

01:27:08.645 --> 01:27:11.690
All of our lives woven together

01:27:11.773 --> 01:27:14.776
in a beautiful web of life and destiny.

01:27:15.819 --> 01:27:17.154
The Spider-Verse.

01:27:17.237 --> 01:27:18.280
Spider-Verse.

01:27:19.198 --> 01:27:20.908
That's stupid.

01:27:21.950 --> 01:27:24.411
It's called
the Arachnohumanoid Polymultiverse.

01:27:25.329 --> 01:27:28.373
Which sounds stupid too, I guess.

01:27:29.541 --> 01:27:32.127
And these nodes where the lines converge?

01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:34.338
[Miguel] They are the canon.

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:39.051
Chapters that are a part
of every Spider's story every time.

01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:41.053
Some good.

01:27:42.596 --> 01:27:43.805
Some bad.

01:27:46.016 --> 01:27:47.017
Some very bad.

01:27:55.317 --> 01:27:56.610
Just keep going.

01:27:56.693 --> 01:27:58.153
Uncle Aaron.

01:27:59.029 --> 01:28:01.990
This one, Event ASM-90.

01:28:02.699 --> 01:28:05.369
A police captain close to Spider-Man dies,

01:28:05.452 --> 01:28:09.706
saving a kid from falling rubble
during a battle with an archnemesis.

01:28:10.332 --> 01:28:11.500
Captain Stacy.

01:28:12.584 --> 01:28:13.877
I'm so sorry.

01:28:24.847 --> 01:28:25.681
No.

01:28:37.150 --> 01:28:38.652
That happened to you?

01:28:40.654 --> 01:28:42.114
And me.

01:28:45.909 --> 01:28:47.661
Ey. What of it?

01:28:48.287 --> 01:28:50.664
[Miguel]
That's how the story is supposed to go.

01:28:51.623 --> 01:28:56.044
Canon events are the connections
that bind our lives together.

01:28:56.795 --> 01:28:59.339
But those connections can be broken.

01:29:00.674 --> 01:29:05.095
That's why anomalies are so dangerous.

01:29:06.263 --> 01:29:08.891
Inspector Singh's death was a canon event.

01:29:08.974 --> 01:29:10.934
You weren't supposed to be there.

01:29:11.018 --> 01:29:13.478
And you weren't supposed to save him.

01:29:14.062 --> 01:29:16.940
-That's why Gwen tried to stop you.
-[Gwen] Miles!

01:29:17.024 --> 01:29:19.234
I thought you were trying to save me.

01:29:20.903 --> 01:29:22.404
I was. I...

01:29:23.822 --> 01:29:25.324
I was doing both.

01:29:25.949 --> 01:29:30.412
And now, Miles,
because you changed the story,

01:29:30.495 --> 01:29:33.165
Pavitr's dimension is unravelling.

01:29:33.874 --> 01:29:36.502
If we're lucky, we can stop it.

01:29:38.086 --> 01:29:39.796
We haven't always been lucky.

01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:42.049
That wasn't me. That was the Spot.

01:29:42.132 --> 01:29:44.801
It's what happens
when you break the canon.

01:29:47.221 --> 01:29:48.305
[Miles] How do you know?

01:29:49.181 --> 01:29:51.391
Because I broke it once myself.

01:29:52.309 --> 01:29:55.854
I found a world where I had a family.

01:29:55.938 --> 01:29:57.314
Where I was happy.

01:29:58.273 --> 01:30:00.192
At least, a version of me was.

01:30:01.652 --> 01:30:04.446
And that version of myself was killed.

01:30:09.701 --> 01:30:10.994
So I replaced him.

01:30:14.498 --> 01:30:16.416
I thought it was harmless.

01:30:19.545 --> 01:30:20.963
But I was wrong.

01:30:21.839 --> 01:30:23.924
[people screaming]

01:30:24.007 --> 01:30:26.718
[poignant, dramatic music playing]

01:30:30.013 --> 01:30:31.849
Daddy? Dad.

01:30:31.932 --> 01:30:33.100
Daddy, no!

01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:39.648
[Miguel] Isn't that right, Peter?

01:30:40.691 --> 01:30:41.525
Yeah.

01:30:42.150 --> 01:30:45.362
You break enough canon,
save enough captains...

01:30:47.489 --> 01:30:49.700
and we could lose everything.

01:31:01.753 --> 01:31:03.922
My dad is about to be captain.

01:31:04.006 --> 01:31:06.175
[ominous music playing]

01:31:13.223 --> 01:31:14.433
No.

01:31:16.685 --> 01:31:18.896
[Spot]
I'm gonna take everything from you...

01:31:20.814 --> 01:31:23.233
-like you took everything from me.
-[Jeff] I'm coming!

01:31:27.946 --> 01:31:29.156
Spot does it.

01:31:31.074 --> 01:31:32.284
He kills him.

01:31:38.707 --> 01:31:41.043
When does it happen?

01:31:44.379 --> 01:31:46.632
-When does it happen?
-In two days.

01:31:47.799 --> 01:31:49.051
When he's sworn in.

01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:52.179
That's what the model says.

01:31:54.181 --> 01:31:55.516
[Miguel] I'm sorry, Miles.

01:31:55.599 --> 01:31:56.767
Send me home.

01:31:57.351 --> 01:31:59.394
I can't do that. Not now.

01:32:00.062 --> 01:32:02.689
What am I supposed to do?
Just let him die?

01:32:06.944 --> 01:32:08.403
What about your dad?

01:32:08.487 --> 01:32:10.072
He's a captain, right?

01:32:12.407 --> 01:32:13.242
Yeah.

01:32:13.825 --> 01:32:15.202
[Miles] And that's it?

01:32:15.285 --> 01:32:16.787
You aren't gonna do anything about it?

01:32:19.831 --> 01:32:21.583
Okay, what about Uncle Ben?

01:32:21.667 --> 01:32:25.754
That have been okay if you knew
and you just let it play out?

01:32:26.463 --> 01:32:28.799
If not for Uncle Ben,

01:32:28.882 --> 01:32:31.552
most of us wouldn't be here, Miles.

01:32:32.511 --> 01:32:35.013
And all the good we did, it...

01:32:35.097 --> 01:32:36.849
It wouldn't have been done.

01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:42.437
So we're just supposed to let people die

01:32:42.521 --> 01:32:45.858
because some algorithm says that
that's supposed to happen?

01:32:45.941 --> 01:32:49.069
You realise how messed up
that sounds, right?

01:32:49.152 --> 01:32:51.905
You have a choice
between saving one person

01:32:51.989 --> 01:32:53.824
and saving an entire world.

01:32:53.907 --> 01:32:54.950
Every world.

01:32:55.033 --> 01:32:57.411
I can do both. Spider-Man always--

01:32:57.494 --> 01:32:58.745
Not always.

01:33:02.291 --> 01:33:05.377
Miles, we all want to live the life
we wish we had.

01:33:06.044 --> 01:33:08.505
Believe me, I have tried.

01:33:08.589 --> 01:33:12.551
And the harder I tried,
the more damage I did.

01:33:14.052 --> 01:33:15.888
You can't have it all, kid.

01:33:20.058 --> 01:33:22.519
Being Spider-Man is a sacrifice.

01:33:23.103 --> 01:33:24.354
That's the job.

01:33:24.438 --> 01:33:26.148
That's what you signed up for.

01:33:27.274 --> 01:33:28.275
[Peni] Miles.

01:33:30.903 --> 01:33:31.945
[Miles] Peni?

01:33:33.113 --> 01:33:34.114
What is this?

01:33:35.908 --> 01:33:37.743
Is this is an intervention or something?

01:33:38.619 --> 01:33:39.745
We know it's hard.

01:33:40.996 --> 01:33:42.456
But it's the truth, Miles.

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:46.752
Is that why you're here?
To let me down easy?

01:33:48.921 --> 01:33:51.298
It worked last time,
why not run it back, huh?

01:33:51.381 --> 01:33:53.383
-Hey, hold on. Hold on.
-You were right, Gwen.

01:33:53.967 --> 01:33:56.803
-You should've never come to see me.
-Kid, look at--

01:33:56.887 --> 01:33:58.222
Stop calling me that.

01:33:58.305 --> 01:33:59.598
-There we go.
-Hobie, not helping.

01:33:59.681 --> 01:34:02.059
-Good.
-Miles, please understand.

01:34:02.142 --> 01:34:04.645
You can't ask me not to save my father.

01:34:04.728 --> 01:34:05.729
I'm not asking.

01:34:06.522 --> 01:34:08.190
Just give him a second, please.

01:34:08.273 --> 01:34:11.276
-This is a great look.
-Don't! Stop it!

01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:14.196
If we let him leave, he'll only do
more damage. We both know that.

01:34:14.279 --> 01:34:16.406
Little man. Peter Pan. Palms.

01:34:16.490 --> 01:34:19.701
[Miguel] Just need to hold you a few days.
Sorry it had to end like this, kid.

01:34:19.785 --> 01:34:23.038
I said not to call me that!

01:34:24.998 --> 01:34:27.000
[all yell]

01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:28.544
[chuckles]

01:34:33.632 --> 01:34:35.884
-[dramatic music playing]
-Miles!

01:34:36.969 --> 01:34:37.970
All right.

01:34:38.053 --> 01:34:40.848
I'm sorry for doing this.
This is bad parenting.

01:34:42.015 --> 01:34:43.684
Just for the record, I quit.

01:34:45.853 --> 01:34:46.937
[blaring]

01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:48.355
-[Spider 1] Huh?
-[Spider 2] Uh...

01:34:48.438 --> 01:34:49.606
[Miguel over PA] All stations,

01:34:49.690 --> 01:34:51.942
drop what you're doing
and stop Spider-Man.

01:34:52.025 --> 01:34:52.901
[music stops]

01:34:52.985 --> 01:34:54.361
-You?
-You?

01:34:54.444 --> 01:34:55.863
-Me?
-Me?

01:34:55.946 --> 01:34:56.947
[Miguel speaks in Spanish]

01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:59.908
[in English] Miles! Miles Morales!
He's entering Sector 4!

01:35:00.742 --> 01:35:02.953
["Light The City Up" playing]

01:35:03.912 --> 01:35:06.498
-Is that him?
-Do I, uh, have web on my face?

01:35:06.582 --> 01:35:07.416
What's the deal?

01:35:07.499 --> 01:35:09.376
[Miguel]
Miles! He's right there. He's right in--

01:35:09.459 --> 01:35:12.087
-Turn around!
-I don't see anything, boss.

01:35:14.923 --> 01:35:16.091
[laughs nervously]

01:35:16.175 --> 01:35:18.677
[Spider-Beings yelling]

01:35:30.564 --> 01:35:32.733
Can this day get any damn weirder?

01:35:35.194 --> 01:35:36.945
Wow! I guess it can.

01:35:43.702 --> 01:35:45.287
-Whoa!
-Sorry!

01:35:50.167 --> 01:35:52.252
And then I looked at my uncle, and...

01:35:52.336 --> 01:35:54.421
Uh, let me guess. He died?

01:36:04.389 --> 01:36:05.432
Whoa!

01:36:07.017 --> 01:36:08.602
On the count of three, draw.

01:36:08.685 --> 01:36:10.687
One-- You didn't wait for three!

01:36:10.771 --> 01:36:12.105
Hey, Miguel!

01:36:12.189 --> 01:36:14.233
Can you take a photo of this?
It's her first chase.

01:36:14.316 --> 01:36:15.567
[camera clicks]

01:36:15.651 --> 01:36:17.528
-[Spider-Being yelling]
-[prisoners booing]

01:36:18.862 --> 01:36:19.947
Boo.

01:36:22.866 --> 01:36:24.785
-[female Spider] Miles?
-[Miles] Hi.

01:36:24.868 --> 01:36:27.287
-I'm a huge fan of your work.
-Thanks.

01:36:27.371 --> 01:36:30.082
Do you think Spider-People too often use
comedy as a crutch?

01:36:30.165 --> 01:36:32.835
-Uh...
-Get it? "Crutch"?

01:36:32.918 --> 01:36:34.837
-I can do anything he can.
-[dramatic sting plays]

01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.713
Oh, dang, I pulled something.

01:36:45.138 --> 01:36:46.849
-[Dr Octopus] Hello, Peter.
-[Miles yells]

01:36:51.228 --> 01:36:52.104
Meow!

01:37:03.073 --> 01:37:04.157
There's nowhere to run.

01:37:08.871 --> 01:37:10.038
[Miles screams]

01:37:12.374 --> 01:37:14.793
My bad, everybody.
There was somewhere to run.

01:37:23.635 --> 01:37:26.805
-[Miguel] Stop running!
-Then stop chasing me!

01:37:26.889 --> 01:37:28.849
[Miguel] You're so frustrating.

01:37:28.932 --> 01:37:32.728
I know he's your friend,
but it's the only way.

01:37:32.811 --> 01:37:35.272
-But my gut says--
-Then use your head.

01:37:54.166 --> 01:37:56.960
[Ben Reilly] I've got you trapped
in my well-defined musculature.

01:37:57.044 --> 01:37:58.462
So don't even-- [yells]

01:38:12.851 --> 01:38:13.894
[yells]

01:38:18.732 --> 01:38:19.691
Miles.

01:38:19.775 --> 01:38:22.528
-No, no. Let me go.
-It is crazy to run.

01:38:22.611 --> 01:38:25.280
Running is the least crazy thing going on.

01:38:25.364 --> 01:38:27.658
-Look, I feel bad.
-Good!

01:38:27.741 --> 01:38:30.661
But this is just how stuff works.
You're not gonna win here.

01:38:30.744 --> 01:38:33.372
Just wait, don't move.
Stop moving so fast.

01:38:33.455 --> 01:38:34.456
No!

01:38:34.540 --> 01:38:36.875
-Do you wanna hold my baby?
-What?

01:38:36.959 --> 01:38:39.086
Would you just give the baby one squeeze
and then we'll talk?

01:38:39.169 --> 01:38:41.755
I think it's gonna change our vibe.
It's very rejuvenating.

01:38:41.839 --> 01:38:43.215
I'm plenty juvenated.

01:38:43.298 --> 01:38:46.802
You'll get more so when you go
chest-to-chest with this magical child.

01:38:46.885 --> 01:38:49.221
You don't get to have
a heartfelt conversation with me.

01:38:49.304 --> 01:38:51.431
Just hold the baby,
we'll see what happens!

01:38:51.515 --> 01:38:52.349
[yells]

01:38:53.475 --> 01:38:55.727
You're the reason I had her, okay?

01:38:57.062 --> 01:39:00.649
I thought that if I did
a decent job raising her,

01:39:00.732 --> 01:39:04.403
then there was a chance
she was gonna turn out like you.

01:39:04.486 --> 01:39:07.990
And that got me excited
because you are a wonderful person.

01:39:08.073 --> 01:39:10.826
-And I like being around you.
-[poignant, pensive music playing]

01:39:12.035 --> 01:39:14.079
Then why didn't you come see me?

01:39:14.872 --> 01:39:15.706
Bec--

01:39:16.999 --> 01:39:18.166
I couldn't.

01:39:19.042 --> 01:39:21.378
I wanted to be with you guys so badly.

01:39:23.797 --> 01:39:26.008
But this thing
isn't what I thought it was.

01:39:26.091 --> 01:39:29.761
Look, bad things are gonna happen.

01:39:29.845 --> 01:39:32.306
It makes us who we are.

01:39:33.307 --> 01:39:36.226
But good things happen too, you know?

01:39:36.977 --> 01:39:38.812
Like you happened.

01:39:40.522 --> 01:39:42.149
And she happened.

01:39:42.941 --> 01:39:44.818
Hey, I don't...

01:39:44.902 --> 01:39:48.780
And you are so bad at holding a baby.

01:39:48.864 --> 01:39:51.408
-[LYLA] We got your location, Peter.
-Wait, wait. No, no!

01:39:51.491 --> 01:39:53.577
You do not have my location. Over.

01:39:53.660 --> 01:39:54.661
Send everyone.

01:39:56.288 --> 01:39:59.541
No, no, no, Miles, I didn't know.
I promise you.

01:39:59.625 --> 01:40:01.418
Please, man, let's talk about this.

01:40:01.502 --> 01:40:02.336
We did.

01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.964
Good talk.

01:40:06.048 --> 01:40:07.049
[grunting]

01:40:10.344 --> 01:40:11.261
[Spider-Man] Get him!

01:40:24.107 --> 01:40:25.359
[Gwen] Miles!

01:40:25.442 --> 01:40:28.278
-Where does he think he's going?
-[Peter] Don't think he planned this out.

01:40:28.362 --> 01:40:30.697
If I hadn't said it before, by the way,

01:40:30.781 --> 01:40:32.616
you're a terrible mentor.

01:40:32.699 --> 01:40:34.660
[dramatic music playing]

01:40:41.333 --> 01:40:44.753
He did just beat you,
so I'm not a terrible mentor.

01:40:44.837 --> 01:40:47.381
[Miguel] You're both equally terrible.
Does that settle it?

01:40:48.882 --> 01:40:51.176
Stop pretending
you know where you're going!

01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:54.555
[Miles] Oh, I have a plan.
I just haven't told you yet.

01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:12.489
-[LYLA] Departing for the moon.
-That's not good.

01:41:20.372 --> 01:41:21.623
[yells]

01:41:24.251 --> 01:41:25.085
[groans]

01:41:31.175 --> 01:41:32.509
What are those, claws?

01:41:32.593 --> 01:41:35.137
Dude, are you sure you're even Spider-Man?

01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:36.638
[Miguel] Are you?

01:41:36.722 --> 01:41:38.932
Who do you think you are? Really?

01:41:41.852 --> 01:41:44.813
My name is Miles Morales.

01:41:50.319 --> 01:41:53.363
I was bitten by a radioactive spider.

01:41:55.282 --> 01:41:57.826
And I'm pretty sure
you know the rest, jerk!

01:42:06.460 --> 01:42:08.170
Hey. What's up, man?

01:42:10.214 --> 01:42:12.341
[Miguel]
You don't get it. You're an anomaly.

01:42:12.424 --> 01:42:14.676
Not if you let me go home.

01:42:15.135 --> 01:42:16.220
[Miguel grunts]

01:42:18.347 --> 01:42:19.223
[Miles] Snitch!

01:42:21.266 --> 01:42:23.519
[Miguel]
Everywhere you go, you're an anomaly.

01:42:31.485 --> 01:42:34.154
You're the original anomaly.

01:42:37.783 --> 01:42:38.951
Miguel!

01:42:39.535 --> 01:42:43.747
[Miguel] The spider that gave you
your powers wasn't from your dimension.

01:42:45.332 --> 01:42:47.334
It was never supposed to bite you.

01:42:48.210 --> 01:42:49.044
Miguel, don't!

01:42:49.127 --> 01:42:51.755
[Miguel] There's a world out there
with no Spider-Man to protect them

01:42:51.839 --> 01:42:53.423
-because it bit you instead.
-No.

01:42:53.507 --> 01:42:55.467
[Miguel]
You're not supposed to be Spider-Man.

01:42:55.551 --> 01:42:57.970
No! You're lying. I'm Spider-Man!

01:42:58.053 --> 01:42:59.513
[Miguel] You're a mistake!

01:43:01.473 --> 01:43:05.102
If you hadn't been bit,
your Peter Parker would have lived.

01:43:05.185 --> 01:43:07.813
Instead, he died saving you.

01:43:08.814 --> 01:43:11.233
He would've stopped the collider
before it ever went off.

01:43:11.316 --> 01:43:12.568
Spot wouldn't exist.

01:43:12.651 --> 01:43:15.904
-And none of this would've happened.
-Peter. [groans]

01:43:15.988 --> 01:43:20.409
And all this time, I have been
the only one holding it all together.

01:43:20.492 --> 01:43:24.246
-[Peter] Miguel, go easy on him!
-You don't belong here.

01:43:24.329 --> 01:43:25.497
You never did.

01:43:25.581 --> 01:43:27.040
Let me go.

01:43:27.124 --> 01:43:29.793
-Miguel, that's enough.
-This isn't what we talked about.

01:43:31.086 --> 01:43:32.504
You talked about this?

01:43:34.047 --> 01:43:35.090
You knew?

01:43:35.174 --> 01:43:37.301
[ominous music playing]

01:43:37.384 --> 01:43:38.552
You all knew?

01:43:39.803 --> 01:43:41.388
I didn't know...

01:43:42.514 --> 01:43:43.724
how to tell you.

01:43:45.392 --> 01:43:47.603
That's why you never came to see me.

01:43:51.023 --> 01:43:54.318
-Miles, it's for your own good.
-Who decides that?

01:43:54.943 --> 01:43:56.612
I'm not a kid, Gwen.

01:43:57.446 --> 01:43:58.989
That's exactly what you are.

01:43:59.072 --> 01:44:03.702
You're just a kid
who has no idea what he's doing!

01:44:09.416 --> 01:44:10.584
Yeah, well,

01:44:10.667 --> 01:44:13.921
I did lure hundreds of Spider-People
away from your little clubhouse.

01:44:14.004 --> 01:44:14.838
What?

01:44:20.636 --> 01:44:22.346
I guess he did plan this out.

01:44:23.972 --> 01:44:26.600
And I'm about to do this.

01:44:31.355 --> 01:44:35.776
Everyone keeps telling me
how my story is supposed to go.

01:44:36.693 --> 01:44:37.819
Nah.

01:44:37.903 --> 01:44:39.321
I'm gonna do my own thing.

01:44:39.404 --> 01:44:41.240
[dramatic music playing]

01:44:42.866 --> 01:44:44.117
[Miguel yells]

01:44:58.966 --> 01:45:00.217
Goodbye, Gwen.

01:45:03.846 --> 01:45:04.930
Miles!

01:45:09.142 --> 01:45:10.561
I taught him how to do that,

01:45:10.644 --> 01:45:13.856
so I gotta be a pretty good mentor
to pull that off.

01:45:24.658 --> 01:45:27.411
Nope. No. Uh-uh.

01:45:27.995 --> 01:45:30.289
That's kind of cute. Oh, no. Mm-mm.

01:45:30.372 --> 01:45:32.416
Been there. Done that.

01:45:33.250 --> 01:45:36.253
-Huh?

01:46:22.716 --> 01:46:23.592
Come on.

01:46:23.675 --> 01:46:25.219
No. No.

01:46:25.302 --> 01:46:27.346
-Oh, no.
-No.

01:46:33.143 --> 01:46:34.561
What's happening?

01:46:34.645 --> 01:46:36.396
The machine activated on its own.

01:46:36.480 --> 01:46:38.357
-How is that possible?
-It isn't.

01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:40.526
It's not possible
for the accelerator protocol

01:46:40.609 --> 01:46:42.486
to engage without entering a sequence key.

01:46:42.569 --> 01:46:45.197
-Okay. Which...?
-Which it's doing right now.

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:47.241
-How about this?
-No.

01:46:47.324 --> 01:46:49.117
-How about now?
-You're getting in the way.

01:47:06.885 --> 01:47:08.512
Stop him! Now!

01:47:08.595 --> 01:47:10.973
What does it look like I'm trying to do?

01:47:19.481 --> 01:47:20.399
Do something.

01:47:21.191 --> 01:47:22.025
Now!

01:47:24.736 --> 01:47:25.571
[Peter] Miguel.

01:47:25.654 --> 01:47:26.780
[Gwen] Miguel, stop!

01:47:30.576 --> 01:47:32.578
[grunting]

01:47:32.661 --> 01:47:35.664
[suspenseful music playing]

01:47:54.516 --> 01:47:55.642
No!

01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:09.281
[Miguel yells]

01:48:09.781 --> 01:48:12.284
Okay. Enough.
It's not the console's fault.

01:48:12.367 --> 01:48:14.244
[Miguel] All he had to do was listen!

01:48:15.162 --> 01:48:17.497
-Why didn't he listen?
-Maybe you weren't hard enough.

01:48:17.581 --> 01:48:19.917
-Gwen, don't do it.
-[Miguel] You let him go.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:21.418
-Me?
-You didn't catch him, Gwen.

01:48:21.502 --> 01:48:24.755
-Okay, let's all just take a breath.
-Peter, you wanna back me up?

01:48:24.838 --> 01:48:29.259
Well, okay, Miguel, as a father
of a daughter and the son of a mother--

01:48:29.343 --> 01:48:31.553
-Yeah, actually, stop talking.
-Okay, duly noted.

01:48:31.637 --> 01:48:33.263
Let me just talk to him.

01:48:34.515 --> 01:48:35.516
We tried that.

01:48:35.599 --> 01:48:37.684
-He's my friend.
-Yeah. And that's the problem.

01:48:37.768 --> 01:48:40.812
Do you know for certain
what happens if he breaks the canon?

01:48:42.105 --> 01:48:46.193
Do you wanna find out?
I told you she was a liability.

01:48:47.444 --> 01:48:48.612
You're wrong.

01:48:48.695 --> 01:48:50.614
Jess, tell him he's wrong.

01:48:52.533 --> 01:48:53.659
He's not.

01:48:53.742 --> 01:48:55.494
Are you serious right now?

01:48:55.577 --> 01:48:59.873
I told you.
You let him get away, I can't help you.

01:48:59.957 --> 01:49:01.542
I'm not coming.

01:49:01.625 --> 01:49:02.793
You're right.

01:49:02.876 --> 01:49:03.794
What...?

01:49:05.587 --> 01:49:06.588
What the hell?

01:49:06.672 --> 01:49:08.590
[dramatic music playing]

01:49:16.598 --> 01:49:18.225
Go home, Gwen.

01:49:23.605 --> 01:49:25.941
We are supposed to be the good guys.

01:49:42.291 --> 01:49:43.292
We are.

01:49:46.628 --> 01:49:47.796
We are.

01:49:49.464 --> 01:49:51.675
Jess, Ben. Come with me.

01:49:51.758 --> 01:49:52.759
Hell, yeah.

01:49:52.843 --> 01:49:54.303
[Miguel] And somebody catch Spot.

01:49:54.386 --> 01:49:57.306
Yeah. Sorry.
I gotta get her down for her nap.

01:49:57.389 --> 01:50:00.309
Not you. I've had the right amount of you.

01:50:00.392 --> 01:50:02.519
[tense, dramatic music playing]

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:16.158
[grunts]

01:50:27.044 --> 01:50:28.045
[groans]

01:50:48.357 --> 01:50:49.191
Hey, hon.

01:50:53.028 --> 01:50:54.029
How was work?

01:50:55.197 --> 01:50:56.365
[Peter] I don't know.

01:50:56.448 --> 01:50:59.868
Peter? Did you bring our baby
to another fight?

01:50:59.952 --> 01:51:02.246
Did I bring our ba--? No. No, no.

01:51:02.329 --> 01:51:05.332
'Cause you asked me not to.
So I didn't. I wouldn't.

01:51:05.999 --> 01:51:08.710
Access denied. Access denied.

01:51:36.864 --> 01:51:38.949
You think I'll be any good at this?

01:51:40.367 --> 01:51:41.743
You're asking that now?

01:51:43.745 --> 01:51:46.206
There's no playbook
for raising someone like her...

01:51:47.374 --> 01:51:50.127
or being someone like you.

01:51:54.381 --> 01:51:57.092
You just gotta make
the right adjustments at half-time.

01:52:02.222 --> 01:52:04.808
-That's a sports metaphor, by the way.
-I understand.

01:52:04.892 --> 01:52:07.561
Sorry. You were just such a nerd
in high school. I figured--

01:52:07.644 --> 01:52:10.189
But I have watched sports.

01:52:10.272 --> 01:52:12.316
-Okay, champ.
-Unbelievable.

01:52:40.511 --> 01:52:41.678
Wanna go easy on the penguin?

01:52:42.846 --> 01:52:44.139
Would you just...?

01:52:45.098 --> 01:52:46.391
You gonna even look at me?

01:52:46.475 --> 01:52:48.685
[poignant music playing]

01:52:48.769 --> 01:52:50.854
What? What is that?

01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:54.399
[Gwen] I'm looking at you. Like you asked.

01:52:54.483 --> 01:52:55.484
[sighs]

01:52:57.110 --> 01:52:58.153
You look skinny.

01:52:59.696 --> 01:53:00.739
Where have you been?

01:53:00.822 --> 01:53:04.117
Just been, uh,
out murdering all my friends.

01:53:04.743 --> 01:53:07.788
Oh, that's funny, yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay.

01:53:13.627 --> 01:53:15.754
-[Gwen] Where are you going?
-I don't know.

01:53:16.547 --> 01:53:17.548
[George sighs]

01:53:20.050 --> 01:53:21.844
You're a good cop, Dad.

01:53:22.970 --> 01:53:25.681
You put on that badge
because you know if you don't,

01:53:25.764 --> 01:53:27.766
someone who shouldn't will.

01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:31.645
But you have to understand,

01:53:31.728 --> 01:53:34.231
this mask is my badge.

01:53:35.232 --> 01:53:38.110
And I'm trying to be good too.

01:53:38.610 --> 01:53:41.029
I was trying so hard

01:53:41.113 --> 01:53:43.448
to wear this thing
the way you would want...

01:53:44.032 --> 01:53:45.534
and I didn't.

01:53:46.326 --> 01:53:47.369
I didn't.

01:53:47.452 --> 01:53:51.039
I can do all these things, but I can't
help the people I love the most.

01:53:51.123 --> 01:53:53.667
And they can only know half of who I am.

01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:57.212
So I'm completely on my own.

01:53:57.296 --> 01:54:00.716
And now I don't even know
what the right thing is anymore.

01:54:00.799 --> 01:54:03.760
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
But I know...

01:54:05.804 --> 01:54:08.473
I can't lose one more friend.

01:54:11.685 --> 01:54:15.147
Gwen, I always taught you
to do it by the book.

01:54:15.230 --> 01:54:16.773
And how did that work out?

01:54:16.857 --> 01:54:19.735
-I took an oath.
-Then arrest me, Dad.

01:54:20.986 --> 01:54:23.822
-Get it over with.
-I... I can't.

01:54:23.906 --> 01:54:25.115
Why not?

01:54:25.991 --> 01:54:27.242
Because I quit.

01:54:28.577 --> 01:54:29.411
When?

01:54:30.704 --> 01:54:32.664
About halfway through your big speech.

01:54:33.498 --> 01:54:34.333
You're...

01:54:34.833 --> 01:54:37.252
Wait a minute,
you're not gonna be captain?

01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:39.588
That means...

01:54:41.298 --> 01:54:43.550
My job, being captain,

01:54:44.301 --> 01:54:47.930
this whole thing doesn't matter anymore.

01:54:52.309 --> 01:54:54.520
You're the best thing I've ever done.

01:55:00.275 --> 01:55:01.902
[tender music playing]

01:55:10.118 --> 01:55:12.788
-It was a good speech, huh?
-No wonder you got an A in English.

01:55:12.871 --> 01:55:14.790
B. I got a B-plus.

01:55:14.873 --> 01:55:16.208
Missed a few classes.

01:55:18.001 --> 01:55:20.212
I don't know what it is you gotta do...

01:55:22.047 --> 01:55:24.550
but I think
that this thing is supposed to help.

01:55:26.718 --> 01:55:29.096
The guy who left it was
a real piece of work.

01:55:32.724 --> 01:55:35.602
[dramatic music playing]

01:55:53.829 --> 01:55:54.997
I'll be right back.

01:55:57.124 --> 01:55:58.125
Promise.

01:56:06.216 --> 01:56:08.552
Parenting stuff is...

01:56:10.137 --> 01:56:11.430
a big-ass mystery.

01:56:12.306 --> 01:56:15.309
[dramatic music playing]

01:56:17.811 --> 01:56:19.271
[Miguel] You're a mistake!

01:56:19.354 --> 01:56:22.941
If you hadn't been bit,
your Peter Parker would have lived.

01:56:23.483 --> 01:56:25.569
And none of this would've happened.

01:56:25.652 --> 01:56:28.238
[Spider-Ham]
Miles, the hardest thing about this job

01:56:28.322 --> 01:56:30.574
is you can't always save everybody.

01:56:30.657 --> 01:56:34.286
[Spot] I'll make you pay
for everything you took away from me.

01:56:34.369 --> 01:56:36.496
[Miguel] You have a choice
between saving one person

01:56:36.580 --> 01:56:38.332
and saving an entire world.

01:56:38.415 --> 01:56:40.501
[Miles] I can do both. Spider-Man always--

01:56:40.584 --> 01:56:41.543
[Peter] Not always.

01:56:41.627 --> 01:56:44.796
[Rio] Whatever you're gonna do out there,
don't get lost.

01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:48.342
-[Peter] Bad things are gonna happen.
-[Gwen] I didn't know how to tell you.

01:56:48.425 --> 01:56:50.344
[Miguel] You were never supposed
to be Spider-Man.

01:56:53.013 --> 01:56:54.014
[Aaron] Keep going.

01:56:56.141 --> 01:56:57.518
[horns honking]

01:56:58.894 --> 01:57:00.103
[grunts]

01:57:11.406 --> 01:57:12.658
Did you check your locations?

01:57:12.741 --> 01:57:14.159
-Yes, Dad.
-No sign of him.

01:57:14.243 --> 01:57:18.288
LYLA, would you send everyone out?
Anywhere. Anywhere he might be.

01:57:18.372 --> 01:57:19.540
Congrats, captain.

01:57:19.623 --> 01:57:22.251
"Captain"? You can't call me that
until I'm sworn in.

01:57:22.334 --> 01:57:24.711
We're all proud of you. See you, jefe.

01:57:24.795 --> 01:57:27.798
[suspenseful music playing]

01:57:51.989 --> 01:57:53.740
[Ben Reilly] Perfect pose.

01:57:55.701 --> 01:57:58.579
Possible disturbance in the alley.
Better go check it out.

01:57:59.288 --> 01:58:03.250
Now I'm here in the alley.
There's something unusual happening.

01:58:03.333 --> 01:58:05.419
Looking at the walls. Those are normal.

01:58:05.502 --> 01:58:08.172
But there's something in front of me.

01:58:09.631 --> 01:58:12.801
[dramatic music playing]

01:58:29.067 --> 01:58:30.152
I made it.

01:58:31.028 --> 01:58:32.029
I'm home.

01:58:32.112 --> 01:58:33.822

[poignant, pensive music playing]

01:58:43.665 --> 01:58:45.125
Is now a bad time?

01:58:45.209 --> 01:58:47.252
-Am I too late?
-What'd you do to your hair?

01:58:47.336 --> 01:58:49.254
Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay.

01:58:50.297 --> 01:58:51.131
I'm okay.

01:58:52.007 --> 01:58:55.010
You were right.
You were right about everything.

01:58:55.093 --> 01:58:57.012
Of course I'm right. I'm always right.

01:58:57.095 --> 01:59:00.891
-What am I right about?
-I saw all these amazing places

01:59:00.974 --> 01:59:03.685
and met all these amazing people, but...

01:59:03.769 --> 01:59:06.021
-[speaks in Spanish]
-[sighs]

01:59:07.356 --> 01:59:08.774
But they didn't want me.

01:59:09.691 --> 01:59:11.818
I kept thinking about what you said.

01:59:13.070 --> 01:59:14.863
And I let them have it, Mom.

01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.616
I beat them all.

01:59:21.286 --> 01:59:23.413
I know how strong I am now.

01:59:24.748 --> 01:59:26.750
I'm strong because of you.

01:59:27.709 --> 01:59:28.544
And Dad.

01:59:28.627 --> 01:59:30.003
[speaks in Spanish]

01:59:30.087 --> 01:59:31.088
And us.

01:59:33.924 --> 01:59:34.758
Mom.

01:59:36.343 --> 01:59:38.262
There's something coming for us.

01:59:39.429 --> 01:59:40.430
Something...

01:59:41.056 --> 01:59:42.057
Something terrible.

01:59:42.140 --> 01:59:44.893
[in English] Miles, you're talking crazy.
What's going on?

01:59:44.977 --> 01:59:48.230
His name is Spot. He's my nemesis.

01:59:49.731 --> 01:59:51.108
And I'm gonna stop him.

01:59:56.613 --> 01:59:58.949
I know you know I've been lying to you.

01:59:59.950 --> 02:00:02.244
It's because I thought if you knew...

02:00:03.662 --> 02:00:05.455
you wouldn't love me the same.

02:00:08.041 --> 02:00:09.960
And then I went out there and...

02:00:11.170 --> 02:00:12.171
And now...

02:00:14.173 --> 02:00:15.799
I'm not afraid of anything.

02:00:18.677 --> 02:00:20.220
What do you wanna tell me?

02:00:20.304 --> 02:00:22.014
Promise nothing's gonna change.

02:00:22.097 --> 02:00:24.600
-Papá, I will always love you.
-You gotta promise.

02:00:24.683 --> 02:00:27.519
Always. I don't care what you say.

02:00:28.437 --> 02:00:29.730
Do ¿me entiendes?

02:00:29.813 --> 02:00:31.106
[sighs]

02:00:33.734 --> 02:00:36.570
[dramatic music swelling]

02:00:36.653 --> 02:00:37.487
Mom.

02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:40.574
I'm...

02:00:42.534 --> 02:00:43.744
I'm Spider-Man.

02:00:43.827 --> 02:00:44.828
[music stops]

02:00:55.005 --> 02:00:56.173
Who's Spider-Man?

02:00:58.634 --> 02:01:01.887
The superhero? He got bit by a spider?

02:01:03.472 --> 02:01:05.057
Gave him spider powers?

02:01:07.809 --> 02:01:08.644
He's me?

02:01:13.732 --> 02:01:17.110
Is this where you dress up
like your favourite character for...?

02:01:17.194 --> 02:01:19.154
What's it called? Comics-Con?

02:01:19.238 --> 02:01:20.656
I don't know what that is.

02:01:20.739 --> 02:01:24.284
You really had me going there. Spider-Man.
[speaks in Spanish]

02:01:32.251 --> 02:01:33.585
Why don't you have eight arms?

02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:35.879
-Um...
-Do you push silk out of your culito?

02:01:35.963 --> 02:01:38.674
-I had a nightmare about that, but no.
-Are you sure you woke up?

[suspenseful music playing]

02:01:57.276 --> 02:02:00.487
Mom, stop playing around. This is serious.

02:02:00.571 --> 02:02:02.197
Dad worked with Spider-Man.

02:02:02.281 --> 02:02:05.701
He didn't realise Spider-Man was me
at the time, but...

02:02:05.784 --> 02:02:08.704
-I wish Dad was here to explain.
-Miles, please.

02:02:12.583 --> 02:02:16.420
I got you to take care of,
I got me to take care of, so help me out.

02:02:16.503 --> 02:02:18.505
Mom, hold on, hold on. I need to talk--

[grunting]

02:02:24.595 --> 02:02:25.429
Oh, no.

02:02:29.933 --> 02:02:31.768
[Gwen] He's in the wrong universe.

02:02:32.895 --> 02:02:36.106
[Miguel] The spider that gave you
your powers wasn't from your dimension.

02:02:36.190 --> 02:02:39.776
-Forty-two.
-[man] Its home dimension.

02:02:46.033 --> 02:02:47.159
[Miles] That machine...

02:02:50.204 --> 02:02:51.538
didn't send me home.

02:03:05.344 --> 02:03:07.095
Uncle Aaron?

02:03:08.430 --> 02:03:09.264
Hey.

02:03:20.901 --> 02:03:21.735
You okay?

02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:30.244
I missed you so much.

02:03:30.327 --> 02:03:32.704
[chuckles] Okay. All right, then.

02:03:33.372 --> 02:03:35.666
-Whoa, you took your braids out?
-Uh...

02:03:35.749 --> 02:03:37.000
-On purpose?
-Yeah.

02:03:37.084 --> 02:03:40.838
Yeah, I'm still getting used to it?

02:03:41.713 --> 02:03:45.259
They gave me more hours at the hospital,
so next month I swear I'll pay you back.

02:03:45.342 --> 02:03:46.844
Stop. Come on. We family.

02:03:47.886 --> 02:03:48.720
Thanks.

02:03:50.430 --> 02:03:53.600
-[Rio] Hey, honey, how you doing?
-Hey. How'd it go with Miles?

02:03:53.684 --> 02:03:56.645
-You know how you grounded him?
-Mm-hm.

02:03:56.728 --> 02:03:59.231
-I ungrounded him.
-You what?

02:03:59.314 --> 02:04:01.900
A little. I mean, how much trouble
could he get into, right?

02:04:01.984 --> 02:04:04.361
-[Jeff] A lot of trouble!
-[Rio] I don't wanna think about it.

02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:08.949
[Rio] Oh, Miles, I have to work
an overnight tonight.

02:04:09.032 --> 02:04:11.410
-Here's the grocery list.
-I'll make sure he gets these done.

02:04:13.245 --> 02:04:14.371
All right, we gotta roll.

02:04:19.418 --> 02:04:21.879
Security switches out at 6.
That's the window, right?

02:04:22.546 --> 02:04:23.839
Right. Yeah.

02:04:24.756 --> 02:04:29.178
I'm following you in what you are saying.

02:04:29.261 --> 02:04:30.762
[grunting]

02:04:33.056 --> 02:04:33.891
You all right?

02:04:35.184 --> 02:04:36.310
I have a cold.

02:04:38.228 --> 02:04:39.229
Come on, man.

02:04:40.230 --> 02:04:41.899
Hey, you sure you got the plan?

02:04:41.982 --> 02:04:45.569
Yeah, but maybe we should
go over it one more time,

02:04:45.652 --> 02:04:47.529
just to make sure there's no...

02:04:48.614 --> 02:04:49.615
problems.

02:04:53.535 --> 02:04:56.538
[dramatic music playing]

02:04:57.289 --> 02:04:59.166
There's no Spider-Man here.

02:05:29.863 --> 02:05:33.200
[Jeff] I'm sorry, baby,
but you did unilaterally unground him.

02:05:33.283 --> 02:05:34.117
[Rio] Jeff...

02:05:34.201 --> 02:05:37.788
[Jeff] I just worry about him getting
mixed up with the wrong people, okay?

02:05:37.871 --> 02:05:39.623
This is probably that girl.

02:05:39.706 --> 02:05:41.792
What is he even thinking, being with her?

02:05:41.875 --> 02:05:43.460
I have some ideas.

02:05:43.544 --> 02:05:47.339
-Baby, you're really not helping.
-You saw the way he lit up around her.

02:05:48.674 --> 02:05:50.884
I just hope she doesn't get him hurt.

02:05:53.595 --> 02:05:55.722
[Jeff] I mean, am I responsible for this?

02:05:55.806 --> 02:05:57.891
-No, no.
-Maybe it's all my fault.

02:05:57.975 --> 02:06:00.769
Come on, papá, you're a great dad.
This is hard.

02:06:00.853 --> 02:06:02.062
This is hard.

02:06:02.145 --> 02:06:07.192
It's like we got a whole new kid
who just wants to grow up so fast.

02:06:07.276 --> 02:06:09.069
[pensive music playing]

02:06:09.152 --> 02:06:11.029
And maybe we gotta grow up too.

02:06:12.781 --> 02:06:13.782
A little bit.

02:06:13.866 --> 02:06:16.910
Maybe we just gotta let him
spread his wings, man.

02:06:17.536 --> 02:06:18.620
"Man"?

02:06:18.704 --> 02:06:20.205
[Gwen] It's not your fault.

02:06:23.166 --> 02:06:24.334
It's mine.

02:06:24.418 --> 02:06:27.379
Oh, come on.
What the heck are you doing here?

02:06:27.462 --> 02:06:29.631
Oh, uh, his window was open so I came in.

02:06:29.715 --> 02:06:32.009
Because that's normal to do.

02:06:32.092 --> 02:06:33.802
I wanna talk to your parents.

02:06:33.886 --> 02:06:35.888
Right. My, uh, dad's kind of hard
to get on the horn.

02:06:35.971 --> 02:06:38.390
Oh, really? What does he do? Deal drugs?

02:06:39.099 --> 02:06:40.225
He's a cop.

02:06:42.436 --> 02:06:43.937
Statement withdrawn.

02:06:44.021 --> 02:06:45.439
I'm gonna call the station.

02:06:45.522 --> 02:06:48.775
I don't think he's there.
Or anywhere around here.

02:06:48.859 --> 02:06:51.987
-That's his jacket, emo. Where's Miles?
-I don't know.

02:06:52.070 --> 02:06:54.114
You don't know?
What do you mean, you don't know?

02:06:54.198 --> 02:06:55.657
Yeah, um, I'll leave.

02:06:55.741 --> 02:06:58.118
Where do you think you're going,
young lady?

02:06:58.202 --> 02:06:59.870
[Gwen] I'm going to find him.

02:07:00.996 --> 02:07:02.789
I don't know where, exactly.

02:07:04.416 --> 02:07:05.959
But I know where to start.

02:07:07.753 --> 02:07:09.588
One thing I learned from Miles:

02:07:11.215 --> 02:07:12.591
It's all possible.

02:07:15.260 --> 02:07:18.388
He loves you more
than you could ever imagine.

02:07:22.684 --> 02:07:23.685
I've seen it.

02:07:29.107 --> 02:07:30.567
If you do find him...

02:07:32.819 --> 02:07:34.446
tell him five months.

02:07:37.074 --> 02:07:38.575
And tell him we love him.

02:07:40.536 --> 02:07:41.370
You got it.

02:07:42.579 --> 02:07:44.623
[dramatic music playing]

02:08:01.181 --> 02:08:04.184
[ominous music playing]

02:08:15.612 --> 02:08:18.198
Uncle Aaron? [grunting]

02:08:23.579 --> 02:08:24.413
Wait, wait.

02:08:25.163 --> 02:08:26.915
Listen to me. Okay, look.

02:08:31.503 --> 02:08:33.922
You don't understand. I'm not from here.

02:08:34.006 --> 02:08:37.259
Listen, okay?
This machine sent me here by mistake.

02:08:37.342 --> 02:08:39.803
Wait, wait, wait. Please. Please.

02:08:39.887 --> 02:08:42.472
Uncle Aaron, wait, wait, wait.
Uncle Aaron!

02:08:52.983 --> 02:08:55.611
["Ain't No Love in the Heart of the City"
playing over stereo]

02:08:59.364 --> 02:09:01.533
Please. Uncle Aaron?

02:09:02.743 --> 02:09:04.244
Just hear me out.

02:09:04.328 --> 02:09:05.954
[volume increases]

02:09:07.956 --> 02:09:10.584
I was bit by a spider that gave me powers.

02:09:11.418 --> 02:09:14.838
It wasn't supposed to bite me.
It was supposed to bite someone else.

02:09:14.922 --> 02:09:16.089
Someone from here.

02:09:16.924 --> 02:09:19.259
I don't belong here. I need to go home.

02:09:19.843 --> 02:09:20.677
Okay?

02:09:23.013 --> 02:09:25.682
I have an Uncle Aaron too. I had one.

02:09:25.766 --> 02:09:28.727
-He was a bad guy called the Prowler.
-[device powers up]

02:09:30.103 --> 02:09:31.522
He looked out for me.

02:09:31.605 --> 02:09:34.441
He did a lot of bad things, but...

02:09:34.525 --> 02:09:36.902
I knew he wanted to be good.

02:09:36.985 --> 02:09:39.780
He just didn't know he had a choice,
but you do.

02:09:40.739 --> 02:09:41.823
You can be a good guy.

02:09:43.867 --> 02:09:45.285
[Aaron] "A good guy"?

02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:49.164
Please. Trust me.
I know you don't wanna be the Prowler.

02:09:53.544 --> 02:09:55.546
[Miles gasping]

02:10:01.927 --> 02:10:02.761
I'm not.

02:10:04.304 --> 02:10:07.015
[suspenseful music playing]

02:10:16.191 --> 02:10:19.611
[Jonah on TV] Mayor Manfredi
has extended New York's mandatory curfew

02:10:19.695 --> 02:10:23.991
as the so-called Sinister Six cartels
battle for control on the streets.

02:10:24.074 --> 02:10:25.826
Is nobody gonna try and stop them?

02:10:25.909 --> 02:10:27.578
[Jonah continues indistinctly]

02:10:41.508 --> 02:10:43.218
Your dad is still alive?

02:10:43.927 --> 02:10:44.928
What?

02:10:45.596 --> 02:10:46.638
Your father.

02:10:47.431 --> 02:10:49.141
You said he's still alive.

02:10:50.309 --> 02:10:51.143
Yeah.

02:10:56.315 --> 02:10:57.566
Who are you?

02:11:01.236 --> 02:11:02.988
[dramatic music playing]

02:11:06.700 --> 02:11:08.035
I'm Miles Morales.

02:11:10.537 --> 02:11:11.538
But you...

02:11:12.414 --> 02:11:14.082
You can call me the Prowler.

02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:17.794
If I don't get home...

02:11:19.213 --> 02:11:21.131
our dad is gonna die.

02:11:21.215 --> 02:11:22.216
Your dad.

02:11:24.885 --> 02:11:25.719
Please.

02:11:27.804 --> 02:11:29.223
You have to let me go.

02:11:35.062 --> 02:11:36.355
Why would I do that?

02:12:14.685 --> 02:12:17.688
[dramatic music continues]

02:12:36.456 --> 02:12:37.541
Don't tell Mom.

02:12:44.673 --> 02:12:46.550
[Gwen]
I never found the right band to join.

02:12:48.635 --> 02:12:50.554
So I started my own.

02:12:54.433 --> 02:12:55.809
With a few old friends.

02:12:55.893 --> 02:12:58.896
[dramatic music continues]

02:13:18.123 --> 02:13:19.124
You want in?

02:13:36.725 --> 02:13:39.728
["Am I Dreaming" playing]

02:16:59.011 --> 02:17:02.013
