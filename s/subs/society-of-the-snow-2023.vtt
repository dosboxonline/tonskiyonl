00:54.333 --> 00:57.375
On October 13, 1972,

00:57.458 --> 01:00.916
a Uruguayan plane crashed
into the Andes Mountains.

01:03.375 --> 01:07.375
There were 40 of us passengers
and five crew members on board.

01:10.208 --> 01:12.083
Some call it a tragedy.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.250
Others, a miracle.

01:19.333 --> 01:20.958
What really happened?

01:23.041 --> 01:25.541
What happens when the world deserts you?

01:27.791 --> 01:31.083
When you have no clothes
and you're freezing?

01:33.375 --> 01:36.125
When you have no food and you're dying?

01:40.375 --> 01:42.416
The answer is in the mountains.

01:44.416 --> 01:46.291
We have to return to the past,

01:46.791 --> 01:49.916
knowing that the past
is what changes the most.

01:54.666 --> 01:56.541
MONTEVIDEO, URUGUAY
OCTOBER 1972

01:56.625 --> 01:58.166
Come on! Get in there!

01:58.250 --> 01:59.458
Come on, Old Christians!

01:59.541 --> 02:01.500
Let's go. We got this.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.125
-Get it! Come on!
-Let's go!

02:03.708 --> 02:05.458
Come on!

02:05.541 --> 02:08.375
Go, Old Christians!

02:10.333 --> 02:11.958
-Let's go, Christians!
-Come on!

02:13.041 --> 02:14.500
Let's go!

02:14.583 --> 02:16.458
Keep it up! Go for it!

02:16.541 --> 02:18.083
Go, Roberto!

02:22.333 --> 02:23.333
Pass it to Nando!

02:23.958 --> 02:24.875
Roberto, throw it!

02:26.166 --> 02:28.000
-To Nando!
-Come on, Roberto!

02:29.958 --> 02:32.458
Pass! Roberto, pass the ball!

02:33.375 --> 02:34.500
Pass!

02:39.958 --> 02:40.958
Pass the ball.

02:43.208 --> 02:45.458
You had four guys on you. I couldn't.

02:45.541 --> 02:48.500
-You could have, but you didn't.
-Less thinking, more doing.

02:48.583 --> 02:50.750
-Like you could do better.
-How could I not?

02:50.833 --> 02:52.958
Okay, but I won us the last championship.

02:53.041 --> 02:53.875
You won?

02:56.875 --> 03:01.375
All right! What's so funny?
How we played today, maybe?

03:02.333 --> 03:04.333
Roberto, you trust me, don't you?

03:04.416 --> 03:07.875
So, when I say,
"Pass the ball," I mean it. Okay?

03:07.958 --> 03:11.416
And when I say the trip money
is due today, I expect it today!

03:11.500 --> 03:15.166
We still have half a plane to fill.
Daniel, are your cousins coming?

03:15.250 --> 03:17.541
-Yeah. Four of us.
-This is for my group.

03:17.625 --> 03:20.250
-You couldn't find an envelope, Coco?
-No.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.500
Anyone else?

03:21.583 --> 03:23.000
Your friends, Gastón?

03:23.083 --> 03:25.583
-Yeah, I got them to come.
-All of them?

03:25.666 --> 03:27.750
Yeah. But I'm still working on one.

03:27.833 --> 03:30.583
"'You are my beloved son,'
the voice said."

03:30.666 --> 03:34.375
"And at once, the Spirit
drove Jesus out into the desert."

03:34.458 --> 03:41.458
"He remained there for 40 days
and 40 nights, tempted by Satan."

03:41.541 --> 03:47.291
"'If you are the Son of God, command that
these stones become loaves of bread.'"

03:47.791 --> 03:52.000
"But Jesus answered,
'One does not live by bread alone,

03:52.083 --> 03:53.333
but by every word…'"

03:54.041 --> 03:55.041
Pancho.

03:56.083 --> 03:57.041
Pancho!

03:57.125 --> 03:59.750
"'Take this, all of you, and eat of it.
This is my body…'"

03:59.833 --> 04:02.041
Pancho, this is for Numa.

04:02.125 --> 04:06.583
"We proclaim your death
and profess your resurrection

04:06.666 --> 04:09.291
until you come again, Lord Jesus."

04:09.375 --> 04:10.666
Take this, Alfredo.

04:12.541 --> 04:15.958
Hey, over here.

04:16.458 --> 04:18.375
Get this to Pancho. There.

04:22.541 --> 04:23.666
Thanks.

04:24.250 --> 04:25.458
Numa.

04:26.375 --> 04:28.750
Excuse me. Can you hand him this?

04:29.875 --> 04:30.875
Gastón.

04:35.500 --> 04:39.750
COME TO CHILE, MAN!

04:39.833 --> 04:43.208
Workers and students,
hand in hand, we stand!

04:43.291 --> 04:47.333
Workers and students,
hand in hand, we stand!

04:47.416 --> 04:49.208
The Commercial Law final's on the 20th.

04:49.291 --> 04:52.000
-I don't have time.
-It'll be postponed at least two weeks.

04:52.083 --> 04:55.083
-I mean, look at this mess.
-It's not just school.

04:55.166 --> 04:58.375
-I'm not even into rugby.
-It's not about the rugby.

04:58.458 --> 05:02.291
Santiago, Chile, for $45.
When are you gonna find a better deal?

05:02.375 --> 05:04.625
-Never!
-Not in a million years!

05:04.708 --> 05:05.916
Check it out.

05:06.000 --> 05:10.291
The numbers of all the girls we met there.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.375
-Graciela…
-A total babe.

05:12.458 --> 05:14.083
-Silvia…
-An elegant belle.

05:14.166 --> 05:16.125
-Beatriz…
-A real bombshell.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.166
-Nélida--
-Not her.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.458
Are you kidding? She's gorgeous.

05:19.541 --> 05:22.625
She left you crying
on the streets of Montevideo!

05:22.708 --> 05:24.583
-Enough, man.
-Come on.

05:25.416 --> 05:27.750
Keep this safe. Don't let Gastón have it.

05:27.833 --> 05:30.708
Okay? Come on. Let's get another round.

05:30.791 --> 05:35.291
Enough with the Nélida thing already.
It's none of your business.

05:35.375 --> 05:38.500
Don't make me go alone
with these two idiots. Please.

05:38.583 --> 05:40.166
This won't convince me.

05:40.916 --> 05:42.791
Want a real reason to go?

05:42.875 --> 05:44.500
-Okay.
-I want us to go together.

05:46.041 --> 05:49.500
You're graduating in a few months.
Then it'll be nothing but work.

05:49.583 --> 05:53.083
You'll be the top lawyer in Montevideo,
and we'll all be proud of you.

05:53.166 --> 05:54.958
But we'll both be off living our lives.

05:55.625 --> 05:58.333
Don't you get it?
This could be our last trip together.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.583
You're not trying to make me cry, are you?

06:02.666 --> 06:06.291
Workers and students,
hand in hand, we stand!

06:15.208 --> 06:16.458
Good evening.

06:25.583 --> 06:28.583
Hey. Get over here. Good boy.

07:06.166 --> 07:07.041
Champ.

07:08.291 --> 07:09.375
What do you think?

07:10.250 --> 07:11.250
Should we go?

07:26.166 --> 07:29.458
It's 8:00 a.m. on this Thursday,
here in Montevideo.

07:29.541 --> 07:30.416
Jackass!

07:31.000 --> 07:34.666
This is Berch Rupenian
with Impactos on Radio Independencia.

07:35.625 --> 07:40.958
We're looking at sun and mild temperatures
heading into this four-day weekend,

07:41.041 --> 07:42.875
so you can have a great time.

07:46.125 --> 07:47.375
Come on, Panchito.

07:56.708 --> 07:58.083
Have a nice day.

08:01.416 --> 08:02.625
Thank you.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.250
Numa!

08:09.791 --> 08:10.875
How's it going?

08:11.625 --> 08:12.625
Hi.

08:12.708 --> 08:15.125
Canessa! Roberto Canessa!

08:15.208 --> 08:16.875
Alexis. Alexis Hounie!

08:16.958 --> 08:18.458
Enrique Platero.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.875
Felipe Maquirriain.

08:19.958 --> 08:21.833
Francisco Abal. Pancho.

08:21.916 --> 08:22.791
Bye.

08:26.833 --> 08:27.916
Behave yourselves.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.750
Say goodbye to your mom.

08:29.833 --> 08:32.250
Have a good time, okay? Bye. I love you.

08:32.833 --> 08:34.125
One. Two.

08:34.250 --> 08:36.291
-Javier, smile.
-Three.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.083
-Got it.
-All right!

08:40.750 --> 08:41.750
Great!

08:41.833 --> 08:43.041
Let's go, guys!

08:43.125 --> 08:44.250
Did you hear it click?

08:44.333 --> 08:45.583
-Yeah.
-Perfect.

08:50.208 --> 08:51.916
My name is Numa Turcatti.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.708
I'm 24 years old.

08:57.166 --> 08:59.666
I hardly know anyone here…

09:02.500 --> 09:04.291
but it all still feels familiar.

09:07.625 --> 09:09.541
Most of them are young, like me.

09:10.666 --> 09:14.166
Raised with love in houses near the sea.

09:16.166 --> 09:17.625
For some of them,

09:18.291 --> 09:21.000
this'll be their first trip
away from home.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.541
Come on, Carlitos. Sit down.

09:37.291 --> 09:40.208
BOAT SINKS ON MONTEVIDEO COAST

09:55.541 --> 09:57.041
Coco, over here.

09:59.916 --> 10:01.583
Good one.

10:01.666 --> 10:04.041
We'll send it to Diego's cousin.

10:05.125 --> 10:06.875
-Get it framed for her.
-Thanks.

10:06.958 --> 10:07.791
Dieguito!

10:07.875 --> 10:10.458
Come on, Panchito. I want to win.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.666
You have great cards.

10:14.791 --> 10:16.041
Your cousin…

10:17.041 --> 10:18.166
Hey!

10:18.750 --> 10:20.625
The shark's hungry today.

10:20.708 --> 10:22.041
The mountain range, huh?

10:22.125 --> 10:25.083
Is it true it tries to suck down
everything that flies over?

10:25.166 --> 10:26.000
Yeah.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.333
It's true.

10:29.250 --> 10:33.333
The warm winds from Argentina
collide with the cold mountain air,

10:33.416 --> 10:35.125
creating a suction effect.

10:35.208 --> 10:36.416
You're joking.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.583
I'm not. That's why there's turbulence.

10:39.666 --> 10:41.916
But we're one step ahead.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.166
Look.

10:46.083 --> 10:48.750
This is the mountain range.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.458
We have to go from here to here.

10:52.541 --> 10:54.416
But the route isn't a straight line.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.666
If only it were that simple.
The mountain range is massive.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.708
That's why we're flying south,

11:00.291 --> 11:02.916
where there's a lower pass.

11:03.000 --> 11:07.458
We'll cross there, and in Chile,
we'll turn north once we hit Curicó.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.625
Ten minutes later, we'll land in Santiago.

11:14.458 --> 11:17.333
Passengers, please fasten your seat belts.

11:17.416 --> 11:19.375
We'll be landing in Santiago shortly.

11:19.458 --> 11:21.208
Deal the cards. I'll be right back.

11:39.458 --> 11:44.375
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your captain, General Carlos Páez.

11:44.458 --> 11:48.875
Please buckle up so your bodies
aren't scattered across the Andes.

11:49.875 --> 11:53.583
-And tell your friends about our airline.
-Excuse me.

11:53.666 --> 11:54.750
Take your seat.

11:54.833 --> 11:56.416
Sit down, please.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.916
Carlitos!

12:00.000 --> 12:02.208
That's enough. Get your seat belt on.

12:03.375 --> 12:07.583
Move to the front.
I'll need some room back here. Go on.

12:36.708 --> 12:39.041
What's the matter? You scared?

12:45.458 --> 12:47.541
Careful, Javier.

12:47.625 --> 12:50.500
Nando. Your seat belt.

12:51.083 --> 12:52.083
Sit down.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.583
Nando!

12:59.666 --> 13:01.250
-Susy!
-Don't move!

13:22.833 --> 13:24.250
More power!

13:45.416 --> 13:47.500
Our Father, who art in heaven…

13:48.291 --> 13:49.708
Hail Mary, full of grace…

14:07.916 --> 14:09.416
Gastón!

15:42.250 --> 15:44.000
-Give me your hand.
-Roberto.

15:47.791 --> 15:48.833
I'm down here!

15:50.791 --> 15:52.708
Eduardo.

15:53.333 --> 15:54.166
Marcelo.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.583
Yeah, man. It's me. I'm here.

16:01.541 --> 16:04.625
No! No more death!

16:04.708 --> 16:08.125
No more death!
I don’t want him to die anymore.

16:09.375 --> 16:10.625
Get him against the wall.

16:10.708 --> 16:12.541
Not like that. Lift him up.

16:14.416 --> 16:17.041
I need you to stay calm. Breathe.

16:17.125 --> 16:20.458
Look at me. I'm a med student.

16:20.541 --> 16:22.333
My name's Roberto. What's yours?

16:22.416 --> 16:23.833
-Álvaro.
-Álvaro what?

16:23.916 --> 16:25.458
Álvaro Mangino.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.041
-The pilot's alive!
-Take this. Help me.

16:39.125 --> 16:40.500
The pilot is alive!

16:40.583 --> 16:45.083
Come on, Gustavo.
On three. One, two, three.

16:45.708 --> 16:46.958
This way. That's it.

16:47.041 --> 16:48.458
DAY 1
OCTOBER 13, 1972

16:48.541 --> 16:50.625
The pilot is still alive. Open this up.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.791
Nothing works. No lights. Nothing.

16:55.875 --> 16:58.208
Tell me how the radio works.

16:58.791 --> 16:59.791
What do I press?

17:04.041 --> 17:07.291
Hello? Our plane crashed in the mountains.
We're from Uruguay.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.750
We crashed in the mountains.
Can anyone hear me?

17:10.375 --> 17:11.458
Does this work?

17:12.833 --> 17:14.708
We passed Curicó.

17:15.208 --> 17:16.208
What?

17:16.291 --> 17:17.833
We're past Curicó.

17:18.583 --> 17:19.583
What's Curicó?

17:20.208 --> 17:21.916
Say it again. I don't understand.

17:24.208 --> 17:25.875
-Help!
-Let's go.

17:26.791 --> 17:27.958
Here!

17:34.791 --> 17:35.791
God…

17:46.708 --> 17:49.458
God be with you.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.583
The night hits like an ambush.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.458
In the span of minutes,
the temperature drops 30 degrees.

18:09.208 --> 18:11.875
If the crash didn't kill us,
the cold will.

18:17.666 --> 18:19.791
We huddle together the best we can.

18:20.625 --> 18:24.083
Survivors and the dead, together.

18:37.375 --> 18:38.375
I'm going home.

18:38.458 --> 18:41.541
Your passport! Give me your passport!

18:42.375 --> 18:43.958
Hold my hand tight.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.625
That's how we spend the night.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.958
Stay awake, or you'll freeze to death!

18:49.041 --> 18:50.333
The injured cry out.

18:50.416 --> 18:51.458
Come on!

18:51.541 --> 18:53.083
So do the rest.

18:53.583 --> 18:56.083
Let me go! Mom!

18:56.666 --> 18:58.000
Mom!

18:58.083 --> 18:59.166
Hold on to me.

19:03.875 --> 19:05.416
Hold me tight, Pancho.

19:09.750 --> 19:14.541
Help. Help!

19:14.625 --> 19:16.625
Help!

20:00.791 --> 20:02.666
We're alive, Pancho.

21:06.916 --> 21:08.208
Can I have one?

21:11.666 --> 21:12.791
Any idea where we are?

21:13.916 --> 21:15.000
Not yet.

21:15.666 --> 21:18.833
Marcelo. Pancho Abal
and Martínez Lamas are dead.

21:18.916 --> 21:20.791
And the lady who was screaming yesterday.

21:21.916 --> 21:24.333
Gastón was thrown out
when the tail broke off.

21:24.916 --> 21:26.541
My cousin Daniel too.

21:27.583 --> 21:29.208
Same with Guido and Alexis.

21:30.250 --> 21:31.625
Nando's dying.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.291
His sister's in bad shape too.

21:34.875 --> 21:37.000
We don't have space to treat the injured.

21:38.083 --> 21:39.750
We'll make room inside the plane.

21:40.916 --> 21:43.875
We can take out the seats so we all fit.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.083
Come on, guys.

21:52.833 --> 21:54.708
We'll need to prioritize the wounded.

21:54.791 --> 21:58.000
Let's set it up on this side
of the plane, where the sun is.

21:58.083 --> 22:01.500
We'll do what we can for them.

22:04.666 --> 22:05.500
-Platero!
-Yeah?

22:05.583 --> 22:09.000
Anything you see that might be useful,
put it in a suitcase.

22:09.083 --> 22:10.958
Check for food in the luggage.

22:11.541 --> 22:14.333
Anything at all.
Put it all in one suitcase.

22:22.291 --> 22:23.666
Here, Bobby.

22:23.750 --> 22:25.208
What do we do with the dead?

22:26.041 --> 22:29.416
Put them over there, to the side.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.916
Just until help arrives.

22:44.708 --> 22:48.750
EUGENIA DOLGAY DE PARRADO - AGE 50
GRAZIELA GUMILA DE MARIANI - AGE 43

22:48.833 --> 22:50.750
DANTE LAGURARA - AGE 41

22:50.833 --> 22:54.791
ESTHER HORTA DE NICOLA - AGE 40
FRANCISCO NICOLA - AGE 40

22:54.875 --> 22:58.791
JULIO FERRADÁS - AGE 39
JULIO MARTÍNEZ LAMAS - AGE 24

22:58.875 --> 23:02.875
FELIPE MAQUIRRIAIN - AGE 22
FRANCISCO "PANCHO" ABAL - AGE 21

23:02.958 --> 23:09.708
FERNANDO VÁZQUEZ - AGE 20
CARLOS VALETA - AGE 18

23:29.750 --> 23:31.166
Some more?

23:31.250 --> 23:32.666
We have to make it last.

24:00.291 --> 24:01.500
Help!

24:02.166 --> 24:08.083
DAY 2
OCTOBER 14, 1972

24:08.916 --> 24:13.083
-Not those.
-Do we have anything bigger? That one.

24:13.166 --> 24:14.583
-No. Don't touch it.
-Roy!

24:14.666 --> 24:17.291
Check for any rags, clothing, or coats.

24:18.416 --> 24:20.458
Okay. Here.

24:21.291 --> 24:22.125
Take this one.

24:22.208 --> 24:24.875
Look for fabric, clothes, whatever.

24:24.958 --> 24:28.083
Coco, take this. It's bigger.

24:28.166 --> 24:29.541
How many will die tonight?

24:30.500 --> 24:32.291
No one's gonna die, Carlitos.

24:32.875 --> 24:34.208
I promise.

24:40.833 --> 24:43.958
Here. Fill in the gaps
to keep the cold out.

24:55.250 --> 24:56.583
Marcelo.

25:07.041 --> 25:08.291
They'll come for us.

25:12.708 --> 25:13.833
Tomorrow.

25:20.791 --> 25:23.666
Fito Strauch isn't
as optimistic as Marcelo.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.833
He's a sensible man.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.875
He'd never disagree with the captain,

25:31.041 --> 25:32.875
but he doesn't like what he sees.

25:36.291 --> 25:38.750
This is a place
where living is impossible.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.166
Where the only thing
that doesn't belong is us.

25:48.583 --> 25:55.583
DAY 3
OCTOBER 15, 1972

25:58.083 --> 26:00.500
Nando. Nando.

26:06.125 --> 26:08.416
No. Nando, don't…

26:17.458 --> 26:18.666
I can't hear you.

26:20.500 --> 26:22.041
What happened?

26:23.458 --> 26:25.000
We hit a mountain.

26:26.208 --> 26:27.500
My sister.

26:28.625 --> 26:29.708
Susy.

26:29.791 --> 26:31.875
She's over there, resting.

26:53.583 --> 26:54.875
Where's my mom?

26:57.041 --> 26:58.458
She died, Nando.

27:12.541 --> 27:15.083
-Bye, Dad.
-See you Monday. Take care of them.

27:15.166 --> 27:16.208
Sure.

27:17.291 --> 27:18.458
Don't worry.

27:27.666 --> 27:30.625
-How long has it been?
-Three days.

27:37.583 --> 27:38.708
Has anyone seen us?

28:13.250 --> 28:15.083
Give me that. Okay. Thanks.

28:35.416 --> 28:37.833
Hey! The wings rocked! They saw us!

28:37.916 --> 28:39.541
-They saw us!
-The wings rocked!

28:41.375 --> 28:42.708
Thank you!

28:59.416 --> 29:01.375
Know what I could go for right now?

29:02.291 --> 29:04.125
A chivito sandwich from Bar Arocena.

29:04.750 --> 29:06.333
A loaded Canadian chivito.

29:06.416 --> 29:08.416
I'd have a milanesa steak from La Mascota.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.750
Yeah.

29:09.833 --> 29:11.750
-With a fried egg on top.
-And fries.

29:11.833 --> 29:14.375
-They make such good milanesas.
-The best.

29:14.458 --> 29:17.458
Amazing milanesas. And the size of them…

29:17.541 --> 29:20.041
With fries and ham.

29:20.125 --> 29:20.958
-Bacon.
-Hey.

29:24.125 --> 29:26.500
Why didn't they throw
some food from the plane?

29:27.958 --> 29:29.125
That would make no sense.

29:30.291 --> 29:33.250
It could sink into the snow.

29:33.333 --> 29:34.875
We'd never see it again.

29:49.041 --> 29:50.625
Bring the wounded here.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.500
Easy.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.458
Careful with his legs.

29:54.541 --> 29:57.000
You're better off here, Arturo.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.583
The Andes are huge.

30:36.916 --> 30:40.958
They'd have to organize the search
in some way. Like by zones.

30:41.041 --> 30:42.541
They were here yesterday.

30:42.625 --> 30:44.250
We saw them fly overhead.

30:45.083 --> 30:47.125
Today we heard them but didn't see them.

30:47.208 --> 30:49.083
I bet they're searching a different area.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.708
That means they didn't see us.

30:51.291 --> 30:52.333
They'll come.

30:53.416 --> 30:56.500
-We just need to have faith.
-Faith? Really?

30:56.583 --> 30:58.916
Not a word to the younger guys.

30:59.916 --> 31:01.916
It'll crush them.

31:02.750 --> 31:06.083
You're the oldest.
You have a responsibility.

31:09.375 --> 31:10.916
They'll find us.

31:16.833 --> 31:19.541
-We can't go on like this.
-How long do we have?

31:20.125 --> 31:22.125
-Heard of the rule of three?
-No.

31:22.208 --> 31:25.333
Three minutes without air,
three days without water,

31:25.416 --> 31:26.958
and three weeks without food.

31:27.041 --> 31:28.625
Three weeks without food.

31:28.708 --> 31:30.666
It's only been three days,
and I'm starving.

31:30.750 --> 31:33.375
It's even worse here.
It's cold and we're at high altitude.

31:33.458 --> 31:36.291
We're burning three or four times
as many calories.

31:36.375 --> 31:38.375
Roque told us about the batteries.

31:39.416 --> 31:40.875
They were in the tail.

31:41.750 --> 31:45.583
We need to climb up,
where the plane crashed, and look for them

31:46.083 --> 31:47.791
so we can get the radio to work.

32:57.833 --> 32:59.125
We gotta keep going!

32:59.208 --> 33:01.666
-The snow is still firm!
-Numa!

33:02.416 --> 33:03.416
Save your energy!

33:04.250 --> 33:06.333
I don't want to carry you back.

33:09.500 --> 33:10.625
Fito.

33:11.875 --> 33:13.125
What is it?

33:14.208 --> 33:16.166
You can't see the plane from here.

33:26.750 --> 33:29.500
They could fly over us,
and they still wouldn't see us.

33:44.541 --> 33:45.791
Let's go back!

33:52.000 --> 33:54.208
We haven't eaten for six days.

33:58.750 --> 34:03.541
Last night, we split the last of our food.
Some saltine crackers.

34:04.375 --> 34:05.625
Now there's nothing left.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.583
Carlitos told me something.

35:28.625 --> 35:30.791
He says Nando's losing his mind.

35:31.625 --> 35:34.833
Last night he told him
he refuses to starve to death.

35:34.916 --> 35:36.541
I refuse to starve to death.

35:37.208 --> 35:40.791
-He'll eat the bodies if he needs to.
-I'll eat the bodies if I need to.

35:47.833 --> 35:50.208
I told him we have no choice.

36:01.375 --> 36:03.791
If we want to keep going,
we need to stay alive.

36:07.250 --> 36:09.208
To stay alive, we need to eat.

36:36.708 --> 36:37.708
Marcelo.

36:40.458 --> 36:41.791
No one is coming.

36:44.125 --> 36:45.916
We're starving to death.

36:47.083 --> 36:50.500
-Wasting away.
-Seven days and nights with no food.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.875
Nothing. If we don't eat something,
we're dead.

36:54.541 --> 36:55.541
Eat what?

36:58.791 --> 37:00.458
You're crazy, Roberto.

37:00.541 --> 37:02.666
You're gonna drive
everyone else crazy too.

37:02.750 --> 37:03.916
There's food out there.

37:10.958 --> 37:13.166
There's protein outside,
the energy that we need.

37:13.250 --> 37:16.083
-It's crazy to continue on like this.
-Roberto.

37:19.583 --> 37:22.416
Roberto's right.
This is a matter of life or death.

37:22.500 --> 37:26.041
What if we're rescued in two days?
Can't we hold on?

37:26.125 --> 37:28.958
-Know what happens when you don't eat?
-Roberto!

37:32.375 --> 37:34.208
Your body shrivels up, like a plant.

37:34.291 --> 37:36.916
So does your brain.
You can't think, Marcelo.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.583
-My pee is black.
-Mine too.

37:39.666 --> 37:40.833
If we do it…

37:42.541 --> 37:44.750
what'll happen to us? Will God forgive us?

37:44.833 --> 37:47.500
He'll understand we're doing
everything we can to survive.

37:47.583 --> 37:49.583
God has nothing to do with this.

37:49.666 --> 37:51.125
I'm sorry, Marcelo.

37:51.208 --> 37:52.875
Luck brought us here.

37:52.958 --> 37:54.375
-Bad luck.
-It's just meat.

37:54.458 --> 37:57.375
-It's people we love.
-How do you even cut up a body?

37:57.875 --> 37:59.583
Who would be able to do that?

38:04.208 --> 38:05.208
I would.

38:07.291 --> 38:08.250
I'll do it.

38:08.916 --> 38:09.958
Me too.

38:10.041 --> 38:11.583
I won't eat.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.250
We can't do it.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.083
Is it even legal?

38:18.041 --> 38:19.750
Won't we go to jail?

38:20.416 --> 38:23.125
-It would be like donating your organs.
-What?

38:23.208 --> 38:27.208
For it to be organ donation,
you'd need the person's consent.

38:27.291 --> 38:28.916
Marcelo, it's a crime.

38:29.000 --> 38:32.625
We can't just go
and use a body without consent.

38:32.708 --> 38:35.208
-We need to eat.
-We don't have that right.

38:35.291 --> 38:38.666
Don't I have the right
to keep myself alive?

38:41.916 --> 38:43.750
Who's gonna take that from me?

40:58.333 --> 40:59.333
Susy.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.750
Susy. Susy, breathe.

41:02.833 --> 41:05.208
No. Susana.

41:05.291 --> 41:06.750
Susana, come on. No.

41:06.833 --> 41:07.833
Gustavo!

41:08.750 --> 41:10.333
Gustavo, help me, please.

41:10.916 --> 41:12.041
Susana.

41:12.125 --> 41:13.666
-Help me.
-What's wrong?

41:13.750 --> 41:17.333
-She's not breathing. I don't know.
-Move her legs. I'll hold her head.

41:17.916 --> 41:20.083
Roberto. She's not breathing, Roberto.

41:20.166 --> 41:22.583
-Roberto, help her.
-Get her over here.

41:23.291 --> 41:25.125
Help me, Gus. Come on!

41:25.208 --> 41:27.500
-She's not breathing.
-Susy!

41:28.541 --> 41:30.958
Coco Nicolich writes a letter
to his parents.

41:35.208 --> 41:36.625
"Dear Mom and Dad,

41:37.708 --> 41:40.916
I'm writing to you
eight days after the plane crashed."

41:44.916 --> 41:46.833
"We are in a beautiful place,

41:47.833 --> 41:51.333
completely surrounded by mountains,
with a frozen lake in the distance,

41:51.416 --> 41:54.166
which will start melting
as soon as the thaw comes."

41:55.875 --> 41:57.250
"We're all doing well."

41:58.333 --> 42:01.041
"At the moment, there are 27 survivors."

42:03.083 --> 42:05.916
"Nando Parrado's sister
passed away today."

42:08.666 --> 42:10.208
"I miss you both so much."

42:13.125 --> 42:14.875
"And I'm constantly praying to God,

42:17.041 --> 42:20.708
asking Him to let me see you again."

42:41.125 --> 42:42.833
This is a graveyard.

42:48.958 --> 42:50.625
I'm not staying here.

43:00.041 --> 43:02.000
My stomach hurts!

43:02.083 --> 43:04.083
I know, Moncho. Calm down.

43:04.166 --> 43:05.291
I can't breathe.

43:06.375 --> 43:08.458
Look at me, Moncho. Breathe.

43:09.375 --> 43:10.791
-I don't want to--
-Breathe.

43:11.666 --> 43:14.583
-I can't breathe--
-You can. Just breathe.

43:14.666 --> 43:16.791
I have to get out of here.
I'm suffocating!

43:16.875 --> 43:20.125
You can't go outside now, Moncho.
Look at me. Calm down.

43:20.208 --> 43:22.791
-I don't want to die here.
-You're not going to die.

43:22.875 --> 43:25.666
-I don't want to die here!
-You're not going to, Moncho!

43:26.416 --> 43:30.541
DAY 9
OCTOBER 21, 1972

43:41.958 --> 43:44.833
If I die,
I give you permission to eat my body.

43:49.500 --> 43:51.000
So you can stay alive.

43:55.541 --> 43:57.750
I give my consent too.

43:58.333 --> 43:59.333
So do I.

44:00.333 --> 44:01.708
I also give my consent.

44:26.166 --> 44:29.375
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

44:29.458 --> 44:32.958
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done…

45:23.541 --> 45:24.541
Sorry.

45:34.166 --> 45:35.500
I'm sorry, Marcelo.

45:39.208 --> 45:40.500
Forgive me, Marcelo.

45:44.500 --> 45:46.083
I'm sorry, everyone.

45:48.083 --> 45:49.333
We have no choice.

45:49.416 --> 45:50.666
I'm sorry, Marcelo.

46:47.166 --> 46:48.791
Don't give me that look, Coche.

46:52.708 --> 46:54.791
This is how I always look at you, Daniel.

47:15.583 --> 47:19.083
The Strauch cousins
handle the most painful job.

47:20.916 --> 47:22.291
The one no one wants to do.

47:24.500 --> 47:25.875
Fito chooses the bodies

47:27.916 --> 47:30.041
that the three cut up, out of sight.

47:32.250 --> 47:34.375
Where the rest of us can't see.

47:36.125 --> 47:39.166
They keep the ones
who do eat from losing their minds.

47:57.750 --> 47:58.708
Hey!

47:58.791 --> 48:00.750
-What?
-I found something!

48:05.083 --> 48:06.208
A radio.

48:09.416 --> 48:10.375
It's soaked.

48:11.041 --> 48:12.250
Come on, Roy. Fix it.

48:22.125 --> 48:24.583
Those of us
who don't eat keep watching the sky.

48:28.541 --> 48:30.208
Waiting for a sign.

48:40.666 --> 48:41.833
Left or right?

48:43.250 --> 48:44.458
Higher, Coco.

48:44.541 --> 48:47.166
If you want it higher,
we'll need to get some wire

48:47.250 --> 48:49.500
and tie it to a pole.

48:49.583 --> 48:50.750
Hold it there.

48:51.625 --> 48:53.250
A little more to the left.

48:54.500 --> 48:55.583
A bit more.

48:57.791 --> 49:00.083
Not that much. A little to the right.

49:00.166 --> 49:01.083
There.

49:05.708 --> 49:07.250
A little to the left.

49:08.333 --> 49:09.583
Higher, Coco.

49:11.916 --> 49:13.916
Careful with the wire.

49:22.583 --> 49:23.583
Here.

49:27.291 --> 49:28.291
What's that?

49:30.041 --> 49:32.541
Come on. It's easier with the snow.

49:32.625 --> 49:33.916
No, thanks.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.125
I can hold out.

49:38.541 --> 49:40.041
You have to eat, Numa.

49:44.541 --> 49:46.333
It's not right, Pancho.

49:50.333 --> 49:54.250
No!

50:02.083 --> 50:06.666
We are coming to you with new information.

50:06.750 --> 50:10.208
The search has ended
for the Uruguayan plane that crashed

50:10.291 --> 50:14.083
in the Andes
with the Old Christians rugby team aboard.

50:14.166 --> 50:16.083
In the required ten days,

50:16.166 --> 50:19.541
66 search and rescue missions
were conducted,

50:19.625 --> 50:22.500
using 17 planes from the Chilean Air Force

50:22.583 --> 50:26.083
as well as planes from the Uruguayan
and Argentinian Air Force,

50:26.166 --> 50:27.958
but to no avail.

50:28.041 --> 50:30.708
Search efforts will resume
at the start of next year,

50:30.791 --> 50:36.125
when the thaw will give better visibility
for finding the wreckage.

50:36.208 --> 50:38.375
The Chilean Air Force's rescue service

50:38.458 --> 50:42.916
has reported that in 34 air accidents
that have occurred in the Andes,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.166
no survivors have ever been found.

50:45.250 --> 50:48.666
We will return after a commercial break.

50:52.166 --> 50:55.666
Because they are made with quality parts.

50:55.750 --> 50:57.791
And with beautiful colors and designs.

50:58.625 --> 51:01.750
Customizable, with three different models.

51:01.833 --> 51:06.166
Bicicletas Victoria, the bicycles
that take home the most wins.

51:08.083 --> 51:09.208
I was wrong.

51:11.583 --> 51:13.541
I asked you to wait for nothing.

51:18.041 --> 51:19.875
But if there's one more thing I can ask…

51:22.291 --> 51:23.416
then I ask you to eat.

51:39.166 --> 51:41.333
Here, we only have our lives.

51:41.416 --> 51:43.916
We have to defend them
above everything else.

51:54.583 --> 51:56.833
We go to look for the tail of the plane.

51:57.333 --> 52:00.000
Without telling anyone,
with no prior planning.

52:01.166 --> 52:04.208
We have to find the batteries
to get the radio to work.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.000
There's more there.

52:53.916 --> 52:55.333
I'm here, Gastón.

53:29.083 --> 53:31.250
That's Daniel Shaw, Fito's cousin.

53:31.916 --> 53:34.125
He was behind me on the plane.
He got thrown out.

53:34.916 --> 53:36.208
The sun's going down.

53:36.291 --> 53:37.833
-We need to head back.
-No.

53:38.916 --> 53:40.291
Just a little further.

53:41.791 --> 53:44.791
If we found all this here,
the tail can't be far.

54:01.083 --> 54:02.250
Who's up there?

54:03.125 --> 54:05.958
Numa, Gustavo, and Maspons.

54:07.958 --> 54:09.500
They didn't take any gear.

54:10.458 --> 54:12.958
The temperature must drop
by 20 or 30 degrees up there.

54:13.875 --> 54:15.500
Once night sets in, they'll freeze.

54:24.333 --> 54:27.333
The sun melted the snow,
and now we're knee-deep in it.

54:27.958 --> 54:30.083
No, that way!

54:38.333 --> 54:42.333
We can barely keep going,
and nightfall has trapped us.

54:54.833 --> 54:56.750
We're going to freeze to death!

54:58.166 --> 54:59.166
Hit me!

55:59.208 --> 56:01.708
The harder you try to escape,

56:02.500 --> 56:04.666
the harder the mountain hits.

56:26.916 --> 56:28.916
Gus, eat.

56:32.416 --> 56:33.541
So, Numa.

56:35.583 --> 56:37.000
What did you see up there?

56:42.708 --> 56:43.958
Numa.

56:44.041 --> 56:45.041
Tell me.

56:45.833 --> 56:47.833
Just mountains with snow.

56:48.375 --> 56:49.666
In every direction?

56:50.500 --> 56:54.875
-As far as I could see.
-What about to the west?

56:55.541 --> 56:58.500
-Could you see past the wall of ice?
-No.

57:00.583 --> 57:01.833
It's impossible to see.

57:03.625 --> 57:05.083
Chile is behind it.

57:07.208 --> 57:08.583
That's where we need to go.

57:10.958 --> 57:12.250
But you need to eat.

57:12.333 --> 57:14.166
Or you won't make it to Chile.

57:52.875 --> 57:53.875
Come on.

58:18.125 --> 58:20.625
I don't chew it
more than two or three times.

58:22.791 --> 58:24.375
And I force myself to swallow.

58:35.083 --> 58:39.875
For the first time,
I consider the very real possibility

58:40.375 --> 58:41.916
that I'll never return home.

58:45.166 --> 58:47.041
But I look at Nando, and I feel hopeful.

58:50.416 --> 58:53.000
He trains every day,
obsessed with one idea.

58:54.291 --> 58:58.291
That beyond that mountain
lie the green valleys of Chile.

59:00.291 --> 59:02.166
But climbing it is suicide.

59:08.625 --> 59:10.291
Still, I'll go with him.

59:12.000 --> 59:16.083
DAY 17
FIFTH DAY OF THE STORM

59:21.833 --> 59:23.750
Look, Vasco, I will answer you

59:24.541 --> 59:26.458
You clearly bought the rhyme you told

59:28.333 --> 59:30.958
Why not get up
And go for a walk in the cold?

59:32.666 --> 59:34.250
That was harsh, Bobby.

59:34.333 --> 59:36.875
-Ready, Carlitos? Go for it.
-Hey!

59:36.958 --> 59:40.500
The 27 of us barely fit
Maybe that is a sign

59:40.583 --> 59:44.333
While we're all cramped down here
Up in the presidential suite, they're fine

59:46.541 --> 59:48.875
As this tragedy does unfold

59:48.958 --> 59:52.666
From my hammock
I see capeless heroes, bold

59:54.250 --> 59:56.541
And though at times
I'm beaten by rage

59:56.625 --> 59:59.500
Being with you
Is a gift from life, so sage

01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:03.666
Though we're in this plane
Dying from the cold

01:00:04.333 --> 01:00:06.708
Coco's lucky I have his feet to hold

01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:10.250
But, Coco, don't get used to this state

01:00:10.750 --> 01:00:13.041
We're going home to Uruguay
Where our families wait

01:00:13.125 --> 01:00:15.333
-Nice one!
-Your turn, Coquito.

01:00:15.416 --> 01:00:17.583
Mine's a bit more sentimental.

01:00:18.583 --> 01:00:20.625
October 13th was my mom's birthday

01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:23.583
I ask God for just one thing

01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:25.958
To send me home safe and sound

01:00:26.583 --> 01:00:29.375
-So for her next party, I'll be around
-Very nice.

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:30.958
Good one, Coco.

01:00:31.041 --> 01:00:33.666
-Nice.
-Here, we have folks who are perfection

01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:36.750
Yet there are others
With no direction

01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:39.666
Who have no clue
Who won the presidential election

01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:43.208
That was awful!

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.375
-All right.
-Just terrible.

01:00:46.083 --> 01:00:49.125
At least I work. Unlike some people.

01:00:49.208 --> 01:00:51.583
Here on the mountain, it's intense

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:55.166
I want to run from it like a puma

01:00:56.208 --> 01:01:00.208
But first, I must hear a verse
From our reserved friend Numa

01:01:06.625 --> 01:01:09.333
On this cold, frozen mountainside

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:12.666
Nothing's here, even the spiders have died

01:01:15.125 --> 01:01:17.708
Inside this icebox

01:01:19.291 --> 01:01:22.000
On the cold slopes
And rocks of the mountain

01:01:24.958 --> 01:01:26.041
Of the mountain…

01:01:27.208 --> 01:01:28.958
All right. Let's hear it for Numa!

01:01:30.875 --> 01:01:31.875
Well done!

01:02:21.416 --> 01:02:23.666
Help!

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:35.416
Roy!

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:54.916
Roy!

01:02:56.666 --> 01:03:00.375
-They're down there!
-I'm here.

01:03:01.666 --> 01:03:03.250
Come on!

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:06.916
Fito!

01:03:09.083 --> 01:03:10.625
Tintín!

01:03:10.708 --> 01:03:12.708
Hold on!

01:03:12.791 --> 01:03:15.833
We're gonna get you out!

01:03:18.375 --> 01:03:20.166
-Coche, help.
-Get them out!

01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:21.416
Dig! Come on!

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:22.625
Hang in there!

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:23.958
Hold on!

01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:26.625
Everyone dig!

01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:31.833
Help, please!

01:03:33.333 --> 01:03:34.500
Hang in there, Numa!

01:03:35.166 --> 01:03:36.458
Numa, I'll get you out!

01:03:44.666 --> 01:03:46.000
Pancho!

01:03:51.916 --> 01:03:52.833
Coco!

01:03:53.833 --> 01:03:55.750
Liliana's underneath! Watch out!

01:03:55.833 --> 01:03:58.541
Don't step there.
Liliana's underneath, for God's sake!

01:03:58.625 --> 01:04:01.416
Watch where you're going!
That's where Liliana is.

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:05.041
Liliana, hold on!
Careful! Liliana's down there!

01:04:05.125 --> 01:04:07.791
Get away from there!
I'll get you out, honey!

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:08.875
Here!

01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:10.791
Coco, come on!

01:04:10.875 --> 01:04:12.791
Coco!

01:04:14.958 --> 01:04:15.875
Coco!

01:04:19.250 --> 01:04:20.250
Breathe!

01:04:21.166 --> 01:04:23.250
Breathe.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.083
Breathe, honey.

01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:27.791
She's not breathing.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.958
-Breathe.
-She's not breathing!

01:04:30.041 --> 01:04:32.416
-Honey, breathe.
-Hold on!

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.375
Breathe.

01:04:34.416 --> 01:04:36.000
Breathe, honey, breathe.

01:04:43.333 --> 01:04:44.458
What's that noise?

01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:45.666
What's happening?

01:04:46.166 --> 01:04:47.958
What is that?

01:05:13.583 --> 01:05:14.750
Come on.

01:05:16.666 --> 01:05:17.833
Air is coming in.

01:05:17.916 --> 01:05:20.041
-There's oxygen.
-Yeah.

01:05:21.916 --> 01:05:23.416
Is everyone okay?

01:05:23.958 --> 01:05:26.458
-Arturo?
-I'm alive.

01:05:26.541 --> 01:05:28.541
Javier too. Liliana isn't.

01:05:28.625 --> 01:05:30.250
-Vasco?
-Over here. I'm alive.

01:05:30.333 --> 01:05:32.000
It's me, Roberto. I'm alive too.

01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:33.666
Same here. Moncho.

01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:34.708
Pedro Algorta here.

01:05:35.333 --> 01:05:37.333
Diego?

01:05:37.458 --> 01:05:39.083
He's dead, Fito.

01:05:39.750 --> 01:05:41.458
Same for Roque.

01:05:41.541 --> 01:05:44.250
Maspons didn't make it.
It's Nando. I'm alive.

01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:45.958
Enrique and Juan Carlos are dead.

01:05:46.041 --> 01:05:47.500
-Tintín, you okay?
-I'm here.

01:05:47.583 --> 01:05:48.708
Coco?

01:05:49.375 --> 01:05:52.458
-Coco?
-Coco's dead. This is Roy.

01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:53.625
What about Marcelo?

01:05:54.125 --> 01:05:55.583
-Marcelo?
-Marcelo!

01:05:55.666 --> 01:05:57.125
-Marcelo!
-Marcelo!

01:05:57.208 --> 01:05:58.416
-Marcelo?
-Captain!

01:05:59.291 --> 01:06:00.541
Marcelo!

01:06:09.375 --> 01:06:11.083
Marcelo was trapped.

01:06:14.458 --> 01:06:17.333
He stopped feeling cold
because he stopped feeling altogether.

01:06:19.625 --> 01:06:21.583
And it's a relief to not feel anything.

01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:28.125
For 17 days, we've been waiting for this.

01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:32.166
A moment of calm.

01:06:35.041 --> 01:06:36.875
A second of tranquility.

01:06:56.583 --> 01:07:00.166
-How much snow is there on top of us?
-It could be the entire mountain.

01:07:02.125 --> 01:07:03.583
Everyone pray, please!

01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:06.541
And blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

01:07:07.958 --> 01:07:09.833
Today is October 30th.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.708
It's my birthday.

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:15.583
I'm turning 25.

01:07:19.708 --> 01:07:22.250
It's so hard to not think about home.

01:07:48.541 --> 01:07:51.291
If there's light,
it means we're not too deep.

01:08:21.291 --> 01:08:23.125
How long will we be stuck here?

01:08:23.791 --> 01:08:25.416
Until the storm passes.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:49.958
DAY 18
TWO DAYS BURIED

01:08:55.833 --> 01:08:57.750
Our hunger is unbearable.

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:06.583
Till now, the Strauch cousins
have been able to make the meat just meat.

01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:09.250
No name.

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:11.916
No face.

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:16.291
But that's no longer possible.

01:09:19.958 --> 01:09:23.958
Guys? You're not gonna do anything?

01:09:35.291 --> 01:09:36.333
Roberto.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.416
We gotta eat to survive, right?

01:10:43.958 --> 01:10:45.708
Are you giving up now?

01:10:50.166 --> 01:10:51.833
After everything we've been through?

01:11:54.125 --> 01:11:56.541
We need to get out of here.
I'm not staying!

01:11:57.750 --> 01:11:59.333
I want out!

01:12:02.625 --> 01:12:03.875
What do you want from me?

01:12:04.916 --> 01:12:06.208
Enough, Numa!

01:12:06.291 --> 01:12:07.291
Come on!

01:12:08.166 --> 01:12:09.208
Stop it, Numa!

01:12:11.083 --> 01:12:12.500
Numa!

01:12:26.791 --> 01:12:32.541
DAY 20
FOUR DAYS BURIED

01:12:54.583 --> 01:12:55.541
The sky.

01:12:56.333 --> 01:12:57.750
I can see the sky!

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:05.791
Moncho, you go first.
You're smaller. Go on.

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:23.916
The sun!

01:13:26.041 --> 01:13:27.875
Come on!

01:13:53.791 --> 01:13:54.958
We made it.

01:13:59.291 --> 01:14:01.875
Hey! What do you see?

01:14:02.458 --> 01:14:05.958
-Your girlfriend Margarita's here, Álvaro.
-In a bikini!

01:14:06.458 --> 01:14:08.083
Tell her I'm coming!

01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:10.291
We're alive!

01:14:10.375 --> 01:14:11.833
We're alive!

01:14:11.916 --> 01:14:13.583
We're still here!

01:14:23.416 --> 01:14:24.500
Quit it, man!

01:14:44.208 --> 01:14:46.208
The bottle.

01:14:58.375 --> 01:14:59.750
How's your leg?

01:15:01.208 --> 01:15:02.416
It's nothing.

01:15:02.500 --> 01:15:03.833
It's just a cut.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:05.833
Save your energy, Numa.

01:15:07.083 --> 01:15:08.625
I'm barely hanging on.

01:15:08.708 --> 01:15:10.333
Don't say that, Arturo.

01:15:13.125 --> 01:15:14.291
Don't lose faith.

01:15:15.333 --> 01:15:17.708
I have more faith now than I've ever had.

01:15:19.333 --> 01:15:21.041
Are you some kind of altar boy now?

01:15:22.791 --> 01:15:23.833
Don't laugh.

01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:32.416
But my faith…

01:15:33.791 --> 01:15:35.208
Sorry, Numa.

01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:37.916
…isn't in your God.

01:15:41.375 --> 01:15:42.750
Because that God

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.125
tells me what to do back home…

01:15:48.166 --> 01:15:50.916
but not what to do out here.

01:15:52.291 --> 01:15:56.708
We can't look at what's happening here
in the same way we did before.

01:15:59.000 --> 01:15:59.916
Numa.

01:16:01.583 --> 01:16:03.041
This is my heaven.

01:16:04.083 --> 01:16:05.958
And I believe in another god.

01:16:08.041 --> 01:16:09.166
I believe

01:16:10.583 --> 01:16:13.208
in the god that Roberto has in his head

01:16:14.333 --> 01:16:16.208
when he treats my wounds.

01:16:20.041 --> 01:16:22.666
In the god that Nando has in his legs

01:16:24.333 --> 01:16:26.958
when he keeps walking no matter what.

01:16:32.791 --> 01:16:34.833
I believe in Daniel's hands

01:16:36.708 --> 01:16:38.291
when he cuts the meat.

01:16:40.583 --> 01:16:42.416
And Fito, when he gives it to us

01:16:44.458 --> 01:16:46.958
without saying which of our friends
it belonged to.

01:16:48.041 --> 01:16:50.125
So we can eat it…

01:16:54.041 --> 01:16:56.166
without having to remember
the life in their eyes.

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:01.750
I believe in that God.

01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:05.875
I believe in Roberto.

01:17:07.625 --> 01:17:08.875
In Nando.

01:17:11.916 --> 01:17:13.000
In Daniel.

01:17:14.916 --> 01:17:16.083
In Fito.

01:17:19.458 --> 01:17:21.125
And in our fallen friends.

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:27.875
You're a philosopher, Arturo.

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.416
An altar boy and a philosopher.

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:51.250
Come on, man.

01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.208
-Come on.
-We have to go.

01:17:54.208 --> 01:17:55.375
Look at the sun.

01:17:55.458 --> 01:17:56.541
We need to wait.

01:17:57.166 --> 01:17:59.791
-For what?
-To prepare.

01:18:00.416 --> 01:18:02.208
What if there's a storm?

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.916
We need to wait till it's warmer.
We can't spend a single night outside.

01:18:07.666 --> 01:18:08.958
Tell him, Numa.

01:18:09.708 --> 01:18:11.583
It'll start to thaw on November 15th.

01:18:11.666 --> 01:18:14.041
Temperatures rise.
There'll be less risk of storms.

01:18:14.125 --> 01:18:18.125
-Two weeks… just waiting around.
-No. Preparing.

01:18:19.208 --> 01:18:22.458
Venturing out without a plan
hasn't gotten us anywhere.

01:18:22.958 --> 01:18:25.583
We don't even know
how far we'll have to go.

01:18:26.166 --> 01:18:27.041
Hey!

01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:29.875
We need help over here.

01:18:29.958 --> 01:18:32.375
-Are you comfortable in those chairs?
-Come on.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.416
-Let's go, man.
-Come help.

01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:36.208
All good?

01:18:36.291 --> 01:18:37.708
Grab those plates.

01:18:37.791 --> 01:18:39.375
Here. Let's get to work.

01:18:40.541 --> 01:18:41.583
Need help?

01:19:04.416 --> 01:19:09.583
DAY 34
THE THAW BEGINS

01:19:18.125 --> 01:19:20.666
Help me, Roberto. Numa, give me a hand.

01:19:21.666 --> 01:19:23.625
Support his head. Very slowly.

01:19:23.708 --> 01:19:24.958
Lift him up. Come on.

01:19:27.083 --> 01:19:29.125
Easy.

01:19:30.291 --> 01:19:32.541
It's okay, Arturo. There you go.

01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:35.208
Pull his shirt up slowly. Like this.

01:19:43.875 --> 01:19:45.208
Arturo's very sick.

01:19:45.875 --> 01:19:48.916
I give him three days.
Vasco, maybe a few more.

01:19:49.416 --> 01:19:50.500
What do you think?

01:19:50.583 --> 01:19:51.791
About?

01:19:52.291 --> 01:19:54.958
-How long do they have?
-What do you want?

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:56.791
Tell me.

01:19:58.375 --> 01:19:59.416
What do you want?

01:20:02.208 --> 01:20:05.000
We've done all we can here
as doctors, Roberto.

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:09.291
We're going to end up
becoming gravediggers.

01:20:11.583 --> 01:20:13.208
I know it's tough.

01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:16.541
But you've got
the strongest legs on the team.

01:20:17.833 --> 01:20:19.666
You have to walk for the rest of us.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:27.583
Pass it!

01:20:29.458 --> 01:20:30.916
Roberto, pass it!

01:20:40.708 --> 01:20:41.791
Lay him over here.

01:20:49.833 --> 01:20:53.125
I'm here. Breathe with me, Arturo.
Come on.

01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:56.708
Arturo Nogueira's lungs
are filled with fluid.

01:20:57.791 --> 01:20:58.916
He can't hold on.

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000
That's it.

01:21:00.833 --> 01:21:01.875
There we go.

01:21:01.958 --> 01:21:03.583
Gustavo tries to help him.

01:21:04.166 --> 01:21:05.541
That's it.

01:21:07.625 --> 01:21:09.416
But no one can breathe for him.

01:21:10.458 --> 01:21:11.833
That's it.

01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:02.208
We need to do everything we can.

01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:12.750
Four of us volunteer.

01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:18.416
We head downhill towards Argentina.

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:23.166
We wear more layers of clothing,
hoping to survive the nights outdoors.

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:24.958
DAY 36
EXPEDITION EAST, ARGENTINA

01:23:01.625 --> 01:23:02.666
Numa!

01:23:15.166 --> 01:23:17.625
Numa, are you okay?

01:23:24.333 --> 01:23:25.500
It's infected.

01:23:32.833 --> 01:23:33.958
We have to go back.

01:23:35.708 --> 01:23:37.125
We can't carry Numa.

01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:42.583
-Roberto.
-I'll head back alone.

01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:49.041
The plane's not far.

01:24:01.916 --> 01:24:03.041
Sorry.

01:24:34.958 --> 01:24:37.541
What happened, Numa? Numa!

01:24:39.208 --> 01:24:41.166
-What happened?
-Where are the others?

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.958
Numa, answer me. Say something, Numa.

01:24:44.041 --> 01:24:45.916
You're here. With us.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.125
Tell us what happened.

01:24:54.833 --> 01:24:55.750
My dad!

01:24:56.250 --> 01:24:57.833
-Vasco, we're here.
-Dad!

01:24:57.916 --> 01:25:00.000
-Easy. We're here. Look at me.
-Where's my mom?

01:25:00.083 --> 01:25:02.791
Look at me. Your dad's here.

01:25:03.791 --> 01:25:06.833
Look. We're here.

01:25:11.416 --> 01:25:13.791
-Dad! Dad, come here!
-Stop.

01:25:16.333 --> 01:25:17.583
Easy.

01:25:18.625 --> 01:25:19.666
We're here.

01:25:21.333 --> 01:25:22.666
Vasco.

01:25:22.750 --> 01:25:24.375
-Vasco, look at me.
-Dad!

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:35.875
-Thank you.
-Rafael… Rafael Echevarren.

01:25:36.458 --> 01:25:37.375
Echavarren.

01:26:04.708 --> 01:26:06.291
I don't get it, Javier.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:11.666
From the second we crashed,
I've tried to help however I could.

01:26:13.458 --> 01:26:14.708
I've always tried…

01:26:16.583 --> 01:26:18.500
to do the right thing.

01:26:22.625 --> 01:26:24.666
And now, with my leg like this…

01:26:28.791 --> 01:26:30.083
I'm useless.

01:26:34.916 --> 01:26:36.500
What is the meaning of it all?

01:26:37.416 --> 01:26:43.375
Arturo, Vasco, and everyone else who died?

01:26:51.166 --> 01:26:53.916
Liliana gave it her all. Always.

01:26:58.291 --> 01:27:03.791
During the avalanche, under the snow,
I could feel her body below me.

01:27:08.208 --> 01:27:11.458
I was only a few inches below the surface,

01:27:11.541 --> 01:27:13.958
so I managed to get my head out,

01:27:14.041 --> 01:27:18.125
and I yelled as loud as I could,
"Liliana, hold on!"

01:27:18.625 --> 01:27:20.541
"I'll get you out. I'm alive."

01:27:21.708 --> 01:27:23.791
I saw them walking over her.

01:27:23.875 --> 01:27:26.625
So I shouted, "Don't step there!"

01:27:27.125 --> 01:27:29.875
"Don't step there! Liliana's underneath!"

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.458
She couldn't get out
if I didn't get out first.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:43.041
But I couldn't move
because my feet were against her chest.

01:27:45.208 --> 01:27:49.166
And if I tried to get out,
I'd have pushed her in deeper.

01:27:55.208 --> 01:27:57.291
Where's the meaning in that, Numa?

01:28:03.625 --> 01:28:06.875
By the time we got to Liliana,
she was dead.

01:28:07.791 --> 01:28:10.708
And while they continued
digging out our friends,

01:28:10.791 --> 01:28:13.666
one dead, another alive,

01:28:14.416 --> 01:28:19.583
I held Liliana as tightly as I could.

01:28:20.666 --> 01:28:24.000
And I felt a love I'd never felt before.

01:28:31.041 --> 01:28:33.500
I realized I had a purpose.

01:28:35.208 --> 01:28:39.500
To take the love that I was holding
so tightly against my chest

01:28:41.125 --> 01:28:43.458
and bring it back to my kids.

01:28:46.958 --> 01:28:48.916
Her death was not in vain.

01:28:53.791 --> 01:28:55.750
That injury doesn't make you useless.

01:29:37.916 --> 01:29:39.166
Nando?

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:41.875
I heard you're lazy now.

01:29:42.375 --> 01:29:45.166
You just sleep all day. Why's that?

01:29:46.125 --> 01:29:48.666
-You need to train.
-What are you doing here?

01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:50.500
You won't believe it.

01:29:51.875 --> 01:29:55.583
We walked east for two or three hours…

01:29:57.291 --> 01:30:00.708
and suddenly, we saw
the tail of the plane behind a hill.

01:30:02.416 --> 01:30:04.208
We never would've found it.

01:30:05.541 --> 01:30:07.500
It shot forward.

01:30:09.250 --> 01:30:10.250
To the other side.

01:30:11.166 --> 01:30:12.333
It was unbelievable.

01:30:12.833 --> 01:30:15.500
There were suitcases
and clean coats everywhere.

01:30:16.375 --> 01:30:17.666
Bottles of rum.

01:30:19.250 --> 01:30:20.750
Cigarettes.

01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:25.916
And chocolate.

01:30:31.541 --> 01:30:33.625
Wait. Don't eat the wrapper.

01:30:35.541 --> 01:30:38.250
You can't tell me what to eat.

01:30:40.625 --> 01:30:41.625
There you go.

01:30:49.375 --> 01:30:51.000
You were right, Numa.

01:30:51.083 --> 01:30:53.333
We spent a night out in the elements.

01:30:54.291 --> 01:30:55.666
It's a miracle we survived.

01:30:58.958 --> 01:31:00.958
But we found the plane's batteries.

01:31:03.583 --> 01:31:04.916
They were in the tail.

01:31:09.791 --> 01:31:12.041
It'll be easier to bring the radio here.

01:31:14.541 --> 01:31:16.458
Roy fixed the portable radio.

01:31:16.541 --> 01:31:19.458
Roberto thinks he can get
the one from the plane to work.

01:31:21.333 --> 01:31:23.083
We're going back down there.

01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.250
We have to try.

01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:53.583
Nando, Roberto, and Tintín go
with Roy to the tail of the plane.

01:31:58.541 --> 01:32:00.250
I wish I could go with them.

01:32:04.708 --> 01:32:07.666
Roy is very weak and doesn't think
that the radio will work.

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:10.083
Come on, Roy. We don't have much time.

01:32:10.666 --> 01:32:12.083
He's terrified.

01:32:13.458 --> 01:32:15.291
But he's doing it for the group.

01:32:25.708 --> 01:32:27.583
-I can't believe it.
-Nice job, Roy.

01:32:37.208 --> 01:32:39.458
1-C-6-0-1.

01:32:40.083 --> 01:32:42.625
B… Not that one. Which was it?

01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:45.666
-One, seven. This one.
-Seven.

01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:47.166
What if the radio doesn't work?

01:32:49.791 --> 01:32:51.083
What then?

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:52.666
We'll venture out again.

01:32:54.500 --> 01:32:55.458
Right, Roberto?

01:32:56.125 --> 01:32:58.125
West, to Chile.

01:33:02.416 --> 01:33:03.541
Hello!

01:33:05.583 --> 01:33:06.458
Hello?

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:11.708
We're the Uruguayans
who crashed in the Andes. Can you hear me?

01:33:12.333 --> 01:33:13.333
We're here.

01:33:14.166 --> 01:33:15.208
Hello?

01:33:19.958 --> 01:33:20.916
Hello?

01:33:36.416 --> 01:33:40.208
With every day that passes,
we lose more of the life we have left.

01:33:45.541 --> 01:33:46.708
Easy.

01:33:46.791 --> 01:33:50.541
The food rations aren't enough,
so we strip the bones of meat.

01:33:52.375 --> 01:33:54.375
What was once unthinkable

01:33:55.333 --> 01:33:56.708
is now routine.

01:34:00.458 --> 01:34:02.458
And we've stopped caring.

01:34:05.041 --> 01:34:06.041
Come on.

01:34:07.916 --> 01:34:09.250
Here. Have some.

01:34:11.625 --> 01:34:13.000
You have to eat, Numa.

01:34:28.541 --> 01:34:29.708
Have half.

01:34:32.416 --> 01:34:33.625
Don't give up now.

01:34:34.291 --> 01:34:36.250
I'm not giving up, Pancho.

01:34:37.416 --> 01:34:38.750
I'm dying.

01:34:46.333 --> 01:34:47.458
And it hurts not…

01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.791
being able to do more for you.

01:34:50.875 --> 01:34:52.250
Stop that.

01:34:53.750 --> 01:34:55.000
Worry about yourself.

01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:58.583
Worry about myself?

01:35:02.166 --> 01:35:03.625
Just look at me.

01:35:03.708 --> 01:35:05.958
I'm 25 years old, Pancho.

01:35:06.625 --> 01:35:10.333
I have my whole life ahead of me.
I have so much left to do.

01:35:11.458 --> 01:35:14.750
I want… to see my siblings again.

01:35:14.833 --> 01:35:17.125
I want to see my mom and dad.

01:35:17.625 --> 01:35:18.916
I want to dance.

01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:20.958
-You never dance.
-I know.

01:35:22.958 --> 01:35:24.208
But now I want to.

01:35:25.166 --> 01:35:27.083
I want to do it all, Pancho.

01:35:29.291 --> 01:35:30.291
I want to laugh.

01:35:30.375 --> 01:35:33.000
-I want to cry.
-So cry, then.

01:35:33.083 --> 01:35:34.541
-I can't.
-Cry.

01:35:35.500 --> 01:35:37.416
Come on, cry.

01:35:38.875 --> 01:35:40.166
Cry with me.

01:35:41.416 --> 01:35:42.750
Why are you laughing?

01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.083
Cry with me. Come on.

01:35:46.166 --> 01:35:47.166
Let it out.

01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:52.833
Come on, dummy.

01:35:55.083 --> 01:35:56.083
Come on.

01:36:21.625 --> 01:36:22.833
Nando!

01:36:22.916 --> 01:36:23.958
Come look.

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:31.750
-What's that?
-It's waterproof.

01:36:32.375 --> 01:36:33.708
We can use this, right?

01:36:34.916 --> 01:36:36.708
It was covering the pipes.

01:36:36.791 --> 01:36:39.041
-Is there more?
-Yeah, plenty.

01:36:40.916 --> 01:36:41.750
One-C.

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:55.083
No!

01:37:00.333 --> 01:37:07.083
AS OF TODAY, NOVEMBER 29, 1972,
THERE ARE 17 MORE SURVIVORS UP ABOVE

01:37:07.166 --> 01:37:11.166
IN THE URUGUAYAN PLANE
THAT CRASHED IN THE MOUNTAINS

01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:27.750
What happened?

01:37:29.583 --> 01:37:31.333
The radio didn't work.

01:37:32.625 --> 01:37:34.291
We found this fabric.

01:37:35.208 --> 01:37:38.000
-What is it?
-Waterproof fabric.

01:37:39.125 --> 01:37:41.791
-We can make a vest.
-Not a vest, Tintín.

01:37:42.291 --> 01:37:45.500
-A sleeping bag.
-We can survive a night outside with it.

01:37:46.541 --> 01:37:48.166
We have enough fabric.

01:37:49.291 --> 01:37:50.916
We could make one big one.

01:37:52.291 --> 01:37:53.625
When are we leaving, Roberto?

01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:01.708
Roberto.

01:38:02.916 --> 01:38:03.916
When?

01:38:06.541 --> 01:38:08.208
Once the sleeping bag's ready.

01:38:08.291 --> 01:38:10.375
Fifty-eight days after the disappearance

01:38:10.458 --> 01:38:14.125
of the Uruguayan Air Force's
Fairchild 571 plane

01:38:14.208 --> 01:38:17.083
with 40 passengers and five crew members,

01:38:17.166 --> 01:38:21.208
chartered to transport
the Old Christians rugby team

01:38:21.291 --> 01:38:22.833
and their companions to Chile,

01:38:22.916 --> 01:38:27.625
the Air Force has prepared a C-47 aircraft

01:38:27.708 --> 01:38:30.458
that will resume the search
in the Andes Mountains.

01:38:31.708 --> 01:38:35.250
Roberto, there's no point
in going back to square one.

01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:37.125
They said they'll look for us.

01:38:37.791 --> 01:38:41.291
Yeah. The idiots
who flew right over us and didn't see us.

01:38:41.375 --> 01:38:43.041
They're searching for bodies.

01:38:43.125 --> 01:38:46.250
-We've been here for two months.
-Two months, Roberto.

01:38:46.333 --> 01:38:48.583
Do you still think
they believe we're alive?

01:38:48.666 --> 01:38:51.291
-We are alive.
-Alive?

01:38:51.375 --> 01:38:52.625
Just look at us.

01:38:53.125 --> 01:38:54.416
Look.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.291
You call this living?

01:38:56.375 --> 01:38:58.708
Look, praying won't get us out of here.

01:38:59.208 --> 01:39:01.708
You're gonna sleep
on the mountain in this?

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.958
What are you doing, Roberto?

01:39:10.625 --> 01:39:12.916
-Stop it!
-Roberto.

01:39:13.416 --> 01:39:14.666
I thought you liked it.

01:40:26.125 --> 01:40:27.125
Guys.

01:40:28.083 --> 01:40:29.625
Look here. Picture time.

01:40:48.416 --> 01:40:50.833
Tintín insists on taking pictures.

01:40:53.583 --> 01:40:57.375
As though he's capturing snapshots
of a trip he'll return from.

01:41:00.041 --> 01:41:01.958
I wonder who those pictures are for.

01:41:03.916 --> 01:41:04.916
For us?

01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:07.000
Smile, damn it.

01:41:07.083 --> 01:41:08.958
I won't be alive to see them.

01:41:09.041 --> 01:41:10.958
Come on. We can still smile.

01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:15.750
Maybe they're for our families.

01:41:15.833 --> 01:41:18.958
Or for other people
who are thinking about us,

01:41:19.041 --> 01:41:22.000
looking at photos of us taken in the past.

01:41:22.083 --> 01:41:23.500
Carlos, look at the camera.

01:41:24.541 --> 01:41:28.875
By seeing us,
we will live again in their imaginations.

01:41:29.791 --> 01:41:32.041
Because they'll ask themselves
the same questions

01:41:32.125 --> 01:41:33.791
we're asking ourselves now.

01:41:37.416 --> 01:41:38.708
"What happened to them?"

01:41:41.458 --> 01:41:42.666
What happened to us?

01:41:45.666 --> 01:41:47.666
Who were we in the mountains?

01:41:49.583 --> 01:41:50.583
Nando.

01:41:51.875 --> 01:41:56.875
I want you to know
you have permission to use my body.

01:41:59.333 --> 01:42:01.250
Numa, don't talk like that.

01:42:03.833 --> 01:42:05.875
I know I'm not making it out.

01:42:09.583 --> 01:42:10.708
Don't say that.

01:42:12.208 --> 01:42:13.500
It's the truth.

01:42:18.125 --> 01:42:19.375
But it's okay.

01:42:20.333 --> 01:42:22.000
I'm at peace with it.

01:42:27.458 --> 01:42:29.500
I'm ready for whatever's next.

01:42:31.666 --> 01:42:33.250
Both of us are.

01:42:35.500 --> 01:42:37.416
And I'm so happy

01:42:38.375 --> 01:42:40.666
to know that you're all gonna make it.

01:42:44.708 --> 01:42:46.625
That makes me happy, Nando.

01:43:39.416 --> 01:43:40.666
Thank you.

01:43:58.458 --> 01:43:59.875
My name is Numa.

01:44:01.541 --> 01:44:04.583
I died on December 11, 1972.

01:44:06.666 --> 01:44:08.125
In my sleep.

01:45:15.875 --> 01:45:22.375
THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE
THAN TO GIVE ONE'S LIFE FOR FRIENDS

01:45:24.250 --> 01:45:25.666
We're leaving tomorrow.

01:45:38.791 --> 01:45:40.041
You got this.

01:45:40.916 --> 01:45:42.041
Good luck, Roberto.

01:45:42.125 --> 01:45:43.708
-Thank you.
-You too.

01:45:48.041 --> 01:45:49.250
One more hug.

01:45:59.291 --> 01:46:00.500
Carlitos.

01:46:01.583 --> 01:46:02.541
Yeah, man?

01:46:04.083 --> 01:46:07.458
You can use my mom's
and Susy's bodies, okay?

01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:09.708
All right!

01:46:09.791 --> 01:46:11.666
-Come on, guys.
-Let's do this.

01:46:12.375 --> 01:46:14.166
-Best of luck!
-Good luck!

01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:19.416
Look both ways before crossing.
And don't forget about us!

01:46:19.500 --> 01:46:22.208
-We'll be here waiting!
-One step at a time!

01:46:22.291 --> 01:46:23.750
Go, guys!

01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:53.125
DAY 61
EXPEDITION WEST, CHILE

01:47:10.250 --> 01:47:11.750
Nando!

01:47:11.833 --> 01:47:14.416
Let's find a place for the sleeping bag!

01:47:16.291 --> 01:47:18.125
We need to climb a bit higher!

01:47:18.208 --> 01:47:19.875
We won't make it to the top!

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:29.708
I'll take the middle.

01:50:01.583 --> 01:50:03.041
It's so beautiful.

01:50:10.375 --> 01:50:12.166
Too bad we're as good as dead.

01:50:15.291 --> 01:50:16.500
I'm not going back.

01:50:17.375 --> 01:50:21.916
The Andes can't go on forever.
The snow has to end at some point.

01:50:22.875 --> 01:50:24.166
The ocean's just over there.

01:50:26.250 --> 01:50:28.708
-You keep saying that.
-Look where we are.

01:50:29.916 --> 01:50:31.416
After all we climbed.

01:50:33.208 --> 01:50:34.750
It's all at our feet.

01:50:36.458 --> 01:50:39.875
We just have to cross the valley.
How long could it take?

01:50:40.833 --> 01:50:42.166
Ten days? Twelve?

01:50:44.250 --> 01:50:46.250
We only have a week's worth of food.

01:50:47.500 --> 01:50:48.833
What do you want to do?

01:50:49.708 --> 01:50:51.041
Walk with me…

01:50:53.166 --> 01:50:54.541
or wait in the plane?

01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:59.416
You're asking me to die with you.

01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:01.375
I'm asking you to come with me.

01:51:02.916 --> 01:51:06.000
Look over there. See those two peaks?

01:51:06.083 --> 01:51:08.500
In the middle.
It's like a pair of breasts.

01:51:09.875 --> 01:51:11.125
There's no snow there.

01:51:12.708 --> 01:51:15.166
See? That's Chile.

01:51:17.583 --> 01:51:18.583
Can you see?

01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:30.750
I see it.

01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:32.750
Thank you.

01:51:33.833 --> 01:51:35.000
Be careful out there.

01:51:40.500 --> 01:51:44.041
Nando and Roberto are continuing west.

01:51:45.750 --> 01:51:49.333
We decided I should turn back
so their food lasts longer.

01:51:52.833 --> 01:51:55.291
From up there,
you can see some lower peaks.

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:57.458
They're brown.

01:52:00.250 --> 01:52:02.000
There's no snow there.

01:52:05.416 --> 01:52:09.500
The guys are just fine.
They have enough food for ten days.

01:52:10.916 --> 01:52:12.333
Nothing's gonna stop them.

01:53:42.708 --> 01:53:43.791
A valley.

01:55:46.416 --> 01:55:47.416
Roberto!

01:55:50.166 --> 01:55:51.166
Roberto!

01:55:52.416 --> 01:55:53.458
Nando!

01:55:57.750 --> 01:55:59.291
Hey!

01:55:59.375 --> 01:56:00.875
Hey! Help us, please!

01:56:01.708 --> 01:56:04.125
We're from a plane
that crashed in the mountains!

01:56:04.208 --> 01:56:07.333
-Hey! Hey!
-We're so hungry!

01:56:12.375 --> 01:56:15.000
AIR RESCUE SERVICE

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:26.791
I'M FROM A PLANE

01:56:26.875 --> 01:56:29.375
"I'm from a plane
that crashed in the mountains."

01:56:29.875 --> 01:56:30.875
"I am Uruguayan."

01:56:33.333 --> 01:56:35.666
"We have been walking for ten days."

01:56:36.208 --> 01:56:39.041
"There are 14 injured people
left in the plane."

01:56:40.083 --> 01:56:42.916
"We need to get out of here quickly,
and we don't know how."

01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.125
Call from San Fernando.

01:56:45.166 --> 01:56:46.666
"We have no food."

01:56:47.166 --> 01:56:48.541
"We are weak."

01:56:49.083 --> 01:56:52.000
-"When will we be rescued?"
-"When will we be rescued?"

01:56:52.083 --> 01:56:56.125
"Please, we can't even walk.
Where are we?"

01:58:31.125 --> 01:58:34.833

02:00:40.708 --> 02:00:44.458
I'm going to tell you their names.

02:00:44.541 --> 02:00:45.500

02:02:30.875 --> 02:02:31.875
All of them!

02:03:00.125 --> 02:03:01.333
We're going home!

02:03:09.416 --> 02:03:11.583
Come on, Javier. Let's go!

02:03:25.625 --> 02:03:28.041
Move, Roy! Get up!

02:03:33.583 --> 02:03:34.750
Come on, Gustavo!

02:03:35.875 --> 02:03:37.375
Leave it behind!

02:03:37.458 --> 02:03:40.166
-What do you mean?
-We can't carry more weight.

02:03:41.666 --> 02:03:43.000
Come on!

02:03:43.083 --> 02:03:45.833
-Gustavo, let's go!
-I'm not going without the suitcase.

02:03:45.916 --> 02:03:48.041
Get in! Where are you going?

02:03:48.125 --> 02:03:49.958

Let's go. Get in!

02:03:54.458 --> 02:03:55.666

02:04:53.916 --> 02:05:00.666
On December 22, 1972,
16 survivors returned from the Andes.

02:05:03.958 --> 02:05:06.083
Today my voice carries their words.

02:05:08.375 --> 02:05:10.958
It tells of how we all played our part.

02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:14.666
This is our story.

02:05:24.166 --> 02:05:25.166
Mom.

02:05:34.375 --> 02:05:36.250
It's a miracle.

02:05:37.291 --> 02:05:39.833
-What do you mean, miracle, Mom?
-It's a miracle.

02:05:39.916 --> 02:05:41.333
What miracle?

02:06:04.375 --> 02:06:06.083
The homecoming is overwhelming.

02:06:09.208 --> 02:06:10.958
What's this crowd doing here?

02:06:14.458 --> 02:06:18.208
Everyone wants to get close to my friends,
to touch them, to hear the details.

02:06:20.083 --> 02:06:21.958
"What happened in the mountains?"

02:06:25.458 --> 02:06:27.583
Yeah!

02:06:28.500 --> 02:06:32.416
The reporters ask,
with their cameras and microphones.

02:06:36.750 --> 02:06:41.541
The doctors ask,
with their exams and instruments.

02:06:47.791 --> 02:06:48.791
What do they see?

02:06:55.625 --> 02:06:57.458
They're frightened by their dirty clothes.

02:07:00.708 --> 02:07:03.666
Their skeletal bodies, burnt by the sun.

02:07:09.291 --> 02:07:10.666
The grime on their skin.

02:07:37.541 --> 02:07:38.541
Nando!

02:07:40.958 --> 02:07:43.625
The newspapers write
about the heroes of the Andes.

02:07:46.666 --> 02:07:50.291
The ones who returned from death
to reunite with their fathers.

02:07:53.583 --> 02:07:54.875
Their mothers.

02:07:55.458 --> 02:07:57.583
You look like an old man.

02:08:01.500 --> 02:08:02.791
Their girlfriends.

02:08:09.208 --> 02:08:10.541
And their children.

02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:35.291
Only, they don't feel like heroes.

02:08:37.791 --> 02:08:40.583
They were dead like us.

02:08:40.666 --> 02:08:42.500
And only they got to return home.

02:09:08.083 --> 02:09:09.625
And now when they remember us,

02:09:10.833 --> 02:09:13.750
they ask themselves,
"Why didn't we all get to come back?"

02:09:16.416 --> 02:09:17.916
"What is the meaning of it all?"

02:09:22.791 --> 02:09:24.625
Only you can give it meaning.

02:09:29.083 --> 02:09:30.916
You're all the answer.

02:09:40.375 --> 02:09:42.291
Keep taking care of each other.

02:09:44.583 --> 02:09:47.541
And tell everyone
what we did in the mountains.

02:09:54.041 --> 02:10:00.583
