WEBVTT

00:55.221 --> 00:56.264
Go! Go!

00:58.558 --> 00:59.768
We need to find cover.

01:06.858 --> 01:11.154
-

01:35.011 --> 01:36.012
Hunter!

01:45.522 --> 01:46.940
Omega--

02:03.832 --> 02:04.874
Status report.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.086
The cities have been destroyed, sir.

02:08.169 --> 02:12.465
All Kaminoan facilities have collapsed
into the sea.

02:14.884 --> 02:15.969
Very good.

02:17.053 --> 02:18.638
Rendezvous with the fleet.

02:45.039 --> 02:46.040
Omega?

02:46.833 --> 02:48.126
Omega, wake up!

02:48.209 --> 02:49.878
Hmm? AZI?

02:50.378 --> 02:51.754
I do not wish to alarm you,

02:51.838 --> 02:54.591
but if you do not vacate this compartment,
you will soon perish,

02:54.674 --> 02:56.593
and I will be left here on my own!

03:01.806 --> 03:02.807
Crosshair!

03:11.065 --> 03:12.483
Hunter, do you copy?

03:13.318 --> 03:16.654
Tech? Echo? Is anyone there? Wrecker?

03:16.738 --> 03:19.407
Yeah, kid. Are you okay?

03:19.490 --> 03:20.491
Not really.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.870
The room is flooding.
And Crosshair's stuck.

03:24.454 --> 03:25.622
Get the door open, Tech.

03:25.705 --> 03:28.458
All compromised compartments
are sealed to contain the flooding.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.501
I cannot override the protocols from here.

03:30.585 --> 03:31.586
I can.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.770
-Greetings, CT-9904.
-

03:48.853 --> 03:52.649
You survived the aerial bombardment
but are now moments away from drowning.

03:52.732 --> 03:54.442
-Get this off of me!
-

03:54.525 --> 03:56.736
AZI, help!

04:14.420 --> 04:16.631
-

04:17.507 --> 04:20.802
Go under and use your boosters.
I'll try to break it free.

04:23.554 --> 04:26.474
Come on. Come on.

04:43.449 --> 04:46.202
Come on! We have to get the door open.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.432
Almost got it!

05:24.407 --> 05:26.200
What have you done?

05:26.284 --> 05:29.579
The Empire opened fire on the city.
We weren't gonna leave you behind.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.247
We don't have time for this.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.459
We need to get topside
before this entire structure submerges.

05:34.542 --> 05:37.378
If you want to stay here and die,
that's your call.

06:10.411 --> 06:13.081
Come on, Omega. We have to go!

06:27.970 --> 06:29.055
Hold on to something!

06:32.517 --> 06:33.643
Whoa!

06:57.959 --> 06:59.585
-

07:28.364 --> 07:29.824
Omega! Omega, watch out!

07:30.700 --> 07:32.660
Oh, you are okay.

07:32.743 --> 07:35.288
I believe we have landed
on the ocean floor.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.707
There is no way
to accurately calculate the damage.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.876
-Most of the facility must be--
-

07:42.044 --> 07:43.171
…compromised.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.132
We need to get to a space
that's more secure.

07:46.632 --> 07:47.633
Follow me.

08:21.250 --> 08:25.254
Ironically, our old barracks
is one of the few compartments habitable,

08:25.338 --> 08:26.923
albeit temporarily.

08:27.006 --> 08:31.093
This is our room?
What happened to it?

08:31.177 --> 08:32.678
At least the smell's gone.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.265
Check it out. Our board's still here.

08:37.642 --> 08:41.771
All those missions together
and you threw it away.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.233
We made a choice, and so did you.

08:45.316 --> 08:47.818
Soldiers follow orders.

08:47.902 --> 08:51.072
Blind allegiance makes you a pawn.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.324
A real leader protects his squad.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.576
Look where that's gotten you.

08:56.536 --> 09:01.415
They're all going to die here
because of your failed leadership.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.668
No, we're not. Look.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.338
We landed on the underwater tunnel.

09:10.633 --> 09:14.262
If we use it to reach the base post,
we could get back to the Marauder.

09:14.345 --> 09:17.723
Accessing the tube will be… challenging.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.392
Better than staying here.

09:19.475 --> 09:20.476
We have to try.

09:21.310 --> 09:23.521
She's calling the shots now?

09:24.855 --> 09:26.399
You have a better idea?

09:41.497 --> 09:45.084
My scans indicate the tunnel
is directly below this maintenance deck.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.714
AZI says, with a precise weld
to maintain an airtight seal,

09:49.797 --> 09:51.007
this might work.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.925
What do you mean, "might"?

10:06.314 --> 10:07.857
The tunnel is clear!

10:23.372 --> 10:26.876
We need to go back.
There must be another way.

10:27.960 --> 10:32.590
That would be unwise.
I am afraid this is our best option.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.383
You done complaining?

10:34.467 --> 10:37.762
You know, if it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

10:37.845 --> 10:40.848
Something on your tiny mind, Wrecker?

10:41.682 --> 10:45.144
All that time,
you didn't even try to come back.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.315
We still would have taken ya.

10:49.398 --> 10:50.608
Let it go, Wrecker.

10:50.691 --> 10:53.694
Crosshair has always been severe
and unyielding.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.488
It is his nature.

10:55.571 --> 10:57.031
You cannot change that.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.116
He cannot change that.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.288
Why are you defending me?

11:04.997 --> 11:06.332
I am not.

11:06.415 --> 11:09.126
Understanding you
does not mean that I agree with you.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.726
AZI, this doesn't look very safe.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.687
Barring any further complications,

11:27.770 --> 11:30.481
this enclosure remains
a viable means of transport.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.401
Let's keep moving.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.163
Uh, I think we got a problem.

11:48.708 --> 11:52.670
AZI, these tunnels are protected, right?

11:52.753 --> 11:57.091
Only when the power is operational,
which it is not.

12:01.512 --> 12:02.722
Run!

12:11.313 --> 12:13.816
Restoring power should deter the creature.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.151
Try to stay alive!

13:17.087 --> 13:20.591
It appears I have caused this structure's
remaining power to short out.

13:20.674 --> 13:24.178
But you have survived the transit.
This outcome is satisfactory.

13:47.952 --> 13:50.246
What is this place?

13:50.329 --> 13:52.248
Nala Se's private lab.

13:52.331 --> 13:56.377
Omega says this is where our mutations
were manipulated and enhanced.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.712
How would she know?

13:59.296 --> 14:00.548
Because she was there.

14:01.340 --> 14:05.678
Omega was created before us.
Technically, she is older than we are.

14:17.022 --> 14:20.526
That's gonna be a problem.

14:23.571 --> 14:26.824
That tunnel was the only way
to the Marauder.

14:27.658 --> 14:30.452
It would seem that, once again,
we are trapped.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.216
AZI, what's wrong?

14:44.300 --> 14:49.388
My battery cells are depleting.
I apologize for the inconvenience.

14:51.223 --> 14:52.725
Long-range comms are down,

14:52.808 --> 14:55.311
and our oxygen levels will be critical
in a few hours.

14:55.895 --> 15:00.316
This is what happens
when you let a kid call the shots.

15:02.818 --> 15:08.532
That kid saved your life,
unlike the Empire who left you for dead.

15:08.616 --> 15:13.579
That's your problem, Hunter.
You take things too personally.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.707
They destroyed an entire city.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.168
They did what needed to be done.

15:20.252 --> 15:23.547
Kamino, regs, the Republic…

15:23.631 --> 15:24.632
that time is over.

15:26.717 --> 15:33.265
The Empire will control the entire galaxy,
and I am going to be a part of it.

15:34.516 --> 15:37.394
Hunter, you made the wrong choice.

15:41.315 --> 15:42.691
Don't fool yourself.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.111
All you'll ever be to them is a number.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.840
You never liked it on Kamino, did you?

16:07.508 --> 16:09.093
Go away.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.053
I understand.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.264
I spent most of my life in this lab.

16:14.890 --> 16:18.477
I was alone down here,
until you four were created.

16:19.937 --> 16:23.607
That's why I was determined
to find you all again.

16:24.858 --> 16:27.903
Being a clone
doesn't make you one of them.

16:30.447 --> 16:33.784
I wanted to believe
it was the inhibitor chip

16:33.867 --> 16:35.703
that made you like this…

16:37.204 --> 16:38.205
but I was wrong.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.550
These medical capsules
are our way out of here.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.719
If our mass is evenly distributed,

16:51.802 --> 16:55.180
the buoyancy of these watertight chambers
will bring us to the surface.

16:55.264 --> 16:58.267
Medical capsules have not been tested
for such capabilities.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.769
We won't have directional control.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.855
How do we avoid the debris field
out there?

17:02.938 --> 17:04.106
The droid.

17:06.984 --> 17:08.027
He can do it.

17:09.069 --> 17:12.072
AZI, can you guide us to the surface?

17:12.156 --> 17:17.536
Barring any extraneous complications,
I should be able to complete the task.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.121
Won't that be dangerous?

17:19.663 --> 17:23.167
Your safety and well-being
is my primary mission objective.

17:39.558 --> 17:42.603
I barely fit in this thing!

17:42.686 --> 17:45.647
Quit complaining.
At least you're not doubled up.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.239
How's your charge holding up?

17:54.323 --> 17:57.701
I have accessed my reserve power.
We must hurry.

18:01.538 --> 18:02.831
The explosives are set.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.751
All right. Seal 'em up.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.424
I can't see anything.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.427
-That is a good thing.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.402
You're doing great, AZI.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.736
-

19:18.615 --> 19:19.616
Omega!

19:50.772 --> 19:51.773
Omega?

19:58.113 --> 19:59.865
Omega? What's happening?

19:59.948 --> 20:03.660
I got caught on some debris.
It's okay. AZI's got me.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.632
Don't give up. We're nearly there.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.719
-Your path is clear.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.889
I have completed my objective.

20:23.972 --> 20:24.973
No!

20:36.652 --> 20:39.279
-I'm going after AZI!
- Omega, don't!

20:47.579 --> 20:48.622
I don't see her.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.381
I'm going in.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.067
-I've got ya.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.255
I have a visual on the Marauder.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.465
I suggest we start paddling.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.478
It's…

22:35.645 --> 22:37.606
all gone.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.027
We should leave
before the Empire's scouts show up.

22:43.278 --> 22:44.613
You coming with us?

22:45.822 --> 22:47.949
None of this changes anything.

22:49.993 --> 22:53.872
You offered us a chance, Crosshair.
This is yours.

22:54.873 --> 22:57.000
I made my decision.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.546
We want different things, Crosshair.

23:02.672 --> 23:04.883
That doesn't mean
that we have to be enemies.

23:45.465 --> 23:46.758
What?

23:47.717 --> 23:49.553
Thank you for saving AZI.

23:51.179 --> 23:52.681
Consider us even.

23:58.562 --> 24:00.730
You're still their brother, Crosshair.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.316
You're my brother too.

24:53.033 --> 24:55.744
Mistress Nala Se, welcome.

24:57.078 --> 25:00.332
We are all admirers
of your scientific talents.

25:01.249 --> 25:04.586
The Empire has big things planned for you.
