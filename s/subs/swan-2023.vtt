00:14.291 --> 00:16.833
from the short story by
ROALD DAHL

00:29.500 --> 00:32.291
Ernie had been given a rifle
for his birthday.

00:32.291 --> 00:35.958
He took the gun and a box of bullets
and went to see what he could kill.

00:35.958 --> 00:37.250
Outside Raymond's house,

00:37.250 --> 00:40.083
he stuck two fingers in his mouth
and gave a long shrill whistle.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.416
[whistles]

00:41.416 --> 00:44.375
Raymond was Ernie's best friend.
He lived four doors away.

00:44.375 --> 00:46.458
He held up the rifle over his head.

00:46.458 --> 00:49.791
"Gripes!" said Raymond.
"We can have some fun with that!"

00:50.375 --> 00:53.708
The two boys set off.
This was a Saturday morning in May.

00:53.708 --> 00:55.750
The chestnut trees were in full flower,

00:55.750 --> 00:58.166
and the hawthorn was white
along the hedgerows.

00:58.166 --> 01:01.083
As Ernie and Raymond
progressed up the narrow hedgy lane,

01:01.083 --> 01:03.166
they shot every little bird they saw.

01:03.166 --> 01:06.083
Bullfinches, hedge sparrows,
whitethroats, yellowhammers.

01:06.083 --> 01:09.208
When they reached the railway line,
there were 14 small birds

01:09.208 --> 01:10.791
dangling on a line of string.

01:11.625 --> 01:14.791
"Look!" whispered Ernie,
pointing with a long arm. "Over there!"

01:14.791 --> 01:16.708
There was a small boy looking up

01:16.708 --> 01:19.416
into the branches of an old tree
through binoculars.

01:19.416 --> 01:21.041
"Watson! That little twerp."

01:22.541 --> 01:24.416
Peter Watson had a small, frail body.

01:24.416 --> 01:27.458
Face freckled
and he wore spectacles with thick lenses.

01:27.458 --> 01:28.791
He was a brilliant pupil,

01:28.791 --> 01:31.666
already in senior class at school
though he was only 13.

01:31.666 --> 01:34.500
He loved music and played the piano well.

01:34.500 --> 01:37.083
He was no good at games.
He was quiet and polite.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.250
The two bigger boys
crept up slowly on the small boy.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.791
He did not see them
because he had the binoculars to his eyes

01:46.791 --> 01:49.458
and was deeply captivated
by what he was looking at.

01:50.416 --> 01:52.791
"Stick 'em up!"
Ernie shouted, pointing the gun.

01:52.791 --> 01:54.500
Peter Watson jumped.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.166
He stared through his spectacles
at the two intruders.

01:59.166 --> 02:01.458
"Go on!" Ernie shouted. "Stick 'em up!"

02:01.458 --> 02:02.875
Peter Watson stood still,

02:02.875 --> 02:05.666
holding the binoculars
in front of him with both hands.

02:05.666 --> 02:07.500
He looked at Raymond and Ernie.

02:07.500 --> 02:11.083
He wasn't afraid, but knew better
than to play the fool with these two.

02:11.083 --> 02:13.708
He'd suffered
from their attentions over the years.

02:13.708 --> 02:14.833
Hands up.

02:14.833 --> 02:16.791
It was the only sensible thing to do.

02:16.791 --> 02:19.708
Raymond stepped forward
and snatched the binoculars away.

02:19.708 --> 02:21.666
"Who you spyin' on?" He snapped.

02:21.666 --> 02:23.916
Peter Watson considered the possibilities.

02:23.916 --> 02:26.708
He could turn and run,
but they'd catch him in seconds.

02:26.708 --> 02:29.291
He could shout for help,
but no one would hear him.

02:29.291 --> 02:31.541
All he could do,
therefore, was to keep calm

02:31.541 --> 02:33.916
and try to talk his way
out of the situation.

02:33.916 --> 02:36.416
"I was watching
a green woodpecker," Peter said.

02:36.416 --> 02:39.666
"A what?"
"A male, green woodpecker." <i>Picus viridis.</i>

02:39.666 --> 02:43.000
"He was tapping the trunk
of that dead tree, searching for grubs."

02:43.000 --> 02:45.041
"Where is he?"
Ernie said, raising his gun.

02:45.041 --> 02:47.333
"I'll 'ave 'im!"
"No, you won't," Peter said,

02:47.333 --> 02:50.416
looking at the string of birds
slung over Raymond's shoulder.

02:50.416 --> 02:54.000
"He flew off the moment you shouted.
Woodpeckers are extremely timid."

02:59.791 --> 03:01.666
Raymond whispered in Ernie's ear.

03:01.666 --> 03:04.083
Ernie slapped his thigh. "Great idea!"

03:04.083 --> 03:06.875
He placed his gun on the ground
and advanced upon the small boy.

03:06.875 --> 03:08.375
He threw him to the ground.

03:08.375 --> 03:11.250
Raymond took out some string
and cut off a length of it.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.416
They tied Peter's wrists together tight.

03:13.416 --> 03:15.041
"Now the legs," Raymond said.

03:15.041 --> 03:17.750
Peter struggled
and received a punch in the stomach.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.541
That winded him, and he lay still.

03:19.541 --> 03:22.041
The bigger boys
tied his ankles with more string,

03:22.041 --> 03:23.583
trussed him like a chicken.

03:23.583 --> 03:25.125
Ernie picked up his gun,

03:25.125 --> 03:28.416
and they began to carry the boy
towards the railway lines.

03:28.416 --> 03:30.416
Peter Watson kept absolutely quiet.

03:30.416 --> 03:33.291
Whatever they were up to,
talking wouldn't help matters.

03:33.291 --> 03:35.208
They dragged him down the embankment

03:35.208 --> 03:38.375
and laid him lengthwise
between the tracks. These tracks here.

03:40.375 --> 03:41.583
These tracks right here.

03:41.583 --> 03:44.625
This happened to me 27 years ago.
My name is Peter Watson.

03:46.166 --> 03:47.750
"More string," Ernie said.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.916
When they finished, Peter was helpless,

03:53.916 --> 03:55.666
tied fast between the rails.

03:55.666 --> 03:58.416
The only parts he could move
were his head and feet.

03:58.416 --> 04:01.333
Ernie and Raymond stepped back
to survey their handiwork.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.333
"We done a nice job," Ernie said.

04:03.333 --> 04:06.291
"This is murder,"
said the boy lying between the rails.

04:06.291 --> 04:08.291
"Not for certain," said Ernie.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.333
"Depends how much clearance
the trains have."

04:10.333 --> 04:13.875
"You keep down flat,
you might just get away with it." [laughs]

04:14.541 --> 04:17.958
The bigger boys climbed up the embankment
and sat behind some bushes.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.166
Ernie produced a pack of cigarettes.
They smoked.

04:20.166 --> 04:22.458
Peter knew
they weren't going to release him.

04:22.458 --> 04:24.458
These were dangerous, crazy boys.

04:24.458 --> 04:27.000
Dangerous, crazy, stupid boys.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.833
"I must try to keep calm and think,"
Peter told himself.

04:29.833 --> 04:32.041
He lay there, still, weighing his chances.

04:32.041 --> 04:34.000
The highest part of his head was his nose.

04:34.000 --> 04:37.750
He estimated his nose was sticking up
about four inches above the rails.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.416
Was that too much?
Hard to say with modern diesels.

04:40.416 --> 04:43.541
His head rested
upon loose gravel between two sleepers.

04:43.541 --> 04:45.875
He must try to burrow down a little.

04:45.875 --> 04:48.791
He began to wriggle his head
pushing the gravel away

04:48.791 --> 04:51.583
and gradually making for himself
a small indentation.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.000
He reckoned
he'd lowered his head two inches.

04:54.000 --> 04:56.083
That would do. But what about the feet?

04:56.083 --> 04:59.000
He tucked them pigeon-toed
so they lay almost flat,

04:59.000 --> 05:00.791
then waited for the train to come.

05:00.791 --> 05:04.458
He wondered whether there might be
a vacuum created underneath the train

05:04.458 --> 05:07.583
as it rushed over him,
sucking him upward. There might.

05:07.583 --> 05:09.166
He must concentrate everything

05:09.166 --> 05:12.041
upon pressing his entire body
against the ground.

05:12.041 --> 05:15.875
"Don't go limp. Keep stiff and tense
and press down into the ground."

05:15.875 --> 05:18.083
Peter watched the white sky
above his head,

05:18.083 --> 05:20.958
where a single cumulus cloud
was drifting slowly.

05:20.958 --> 05:22.791
An aeroplane came across the cloud.

05:22.791 --> 05:25.041
A small high-winged monoplane
with a red fuselage.

05:25.041 --> 05:29.208
An old Piper Cub, he thought it was.
He watched it until it disappeared.

05:29.208 --> 05:30.416
Then, quite suddenly,

05:30.416 --> 05:34.291
he heard a curious vibrating sound
coming from the rails either side of him.

05:34.291 --> 05:37.541
It was very soft, scarcely audible,
a tiny, thrumming whisper

05:37.541 --> 05:40.375
that seemed to be
coming along the rails from far away.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.375
[rails rattling softly]

05:46.125 --> 05:48.875
Peter raised his head
and looked down the railway line

05:48.875 --> 05:51.083
that stretched for a mile in the distance,

05:51.083 --> 05:52.166
and saw the train.

05:52.166 --> 05:55.166
First, only a black dot,
but as he kept his head raised,

05:55.166 --> 05:56.750
the dot grew bigger and bigger

05:56.750 --> 05:59.208
and began to take shape
and was no longer a dot,

05:59.208 --> 06:02.500
but instead, the big, square,
blunt front-end of a diesel engine.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.041
Peter dropped his head
and pushed it down hard into the hole

06:05.041 --> 06:06.958
- he'd dug in the gravel.
- [train bell dinging]

06:06.958 --> 06:08.500
He pigeon-toed his feet flat.

06:08.500 --> 06:11.541
He shut his eyes tight
and pressed his body into the ground.

06:11.541 --> 06:14.416
The train came on with an explosive blast.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.166
Like a gun went off in his head.

06:16.166 --> 06:18.833
With the explosion
came a tearing, screaming wind

06:18.833 --> 06:22.291
like a hurricane blowing down his nostrils
and into his lungs.

06:22.291 --> 06:25.041
The noise was shattering.
The wind choked him.

06:25.041 --> 06:27.166
He felt as if he were being eaten alive

06:27.166 --> 06:31.083
and swallowed up in the belly
of a screaming, murderous monster.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.875
[Peter] <i>And then it was over.
The train was gone.</i>

06:33.875 --> 06:36.458
Peter Watson opened his eyes
and saw the white sky

06:36.458 --> 06:39.041
and the big, white cloud
still drifting overhead.

06:39.041 --> 06:41.625
It was all over, and he had done it.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.791
- Cut him loose.
- ...Ernie said.

06:49.791 --> 06:52.666
Raymond cut the strings
binding Peter to the rails.

06:52.666 --> 06:55.083
"Undo his feet, but keep his hands tied."

06:55.083 --> 06:57.458
Raymond cut the strings around his ankles.

06:57.458 --> 07:00.583
"Oh, you're still a prisoner, matey,"
Ernie said.

07:00.583 --> 07:04.625
The two bigger boys marched Peter Watson
across the next field towards the lake.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.333
The prisoner's wrists
were still tied together.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.416
Ernie held the gun in his spare hand

07:09.416 --> 07:12.416
and Raymond carried the binoculars
he had taken from Peter.

07:16.041 --> 07:17.458
The lake was long and narrow

07:17.458 --> 07:19.791
with tall willow trees
growing along its bank.

07:19.791 --> 07:21.666
In the middle, the water was clear,

07:21.666 --> 07:24.208
but closer to the shore
was a forest of bulrushes.

07:24.208 --> 07:26.958
"Now, then," Ernie said.
"What I suggest is this."

07:26.958 --> 07:29.000
"You take his arms, I'll take his legs,

07:29.000 --> 07:33.000
and we'll swing him as far out as we can
over them nice muddy reeds."

07:33.000 --> 07:35.708
"Look!" Raymond interrupted.
"There! Let's have him!"

07:35.708 --> 07:37.791
Peter Watson turned and saw it at once.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.791
A nest consisting
of a huge pile of reeds and rushes

07:40.791 --> 07:43.000
that rose up two feet above the waterline.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.291
And, on top, a magnificent white swan
sitting serenely as the Lady of the Lake.

07:47.291 --> 07:50.791
Her head was turned towards the boys,
alert and watchful.

07:50.791 --> 07:53.250
"Holy cats!" cried Raymond.
"What a beauty!"

07:53.250 --> 07:56.791
Ernie let go of the prisoner's arm
and lifted the gun to his shoulder.

07:56.791 --> 08:00.416
"This is... This is a bird sanctuary,"
said Peter, stammering.

08:00.416 --> 08:02.291
"A what?" asked Ernie.

08:02.291 --> 08:05.541
Peter felt a wild rage
beginning to build up inside him.

08:05.541 --> 08:07.333
He tried to keep his voice calm.

08:07.333 --> 08:09.750
"Swans are the most
protected birds in England,

08:09.750 --> 08:13.291
and nobody shoots a bird on its nest.
She may have cygnets under her."

08:13.291 --> 08:16.583
"Please don't do it. You can't do it.
Please, don't do it! Stop!"

08:16.583 --> 08:18.083
[wings fluttering]

08:18.083 --> 08:20.333
The bullet hit the swan
in her elegant head

08:20.333 --> 08:23.500
and her long white neck
sank slowly to the side of the nest.

08:33.875 --> 08:34.750
Open.

08:47.708 --> 08:50.083
"Cut his hands free, Raymond.
He's our gun-dog."

08:50.083 --> 08:53.041
Raymond cut the strings
binding the small boy's wrists.

08:53.041 --> 08:54.208
"Go get him!"

08:54.208 --> 08:55.500
"I refuse," I said.

08:56.375 --> 08:59.458
Ernie hit Peter
across the face, hard, with his open hand.

08:59.458 --> 09:02.125
A trickle of blood
began running out of one nostril.

09:02.125 --> 09:05.791
"Try refusin' one more time,
and I'm goin' to make you a promise:

09:05.791 --> 09:08.708
I'll knock out every one
of your shiny white front teeth,

09:08.708 --> 09:10.833
top and bottom. You understand that?"

09:10.833 --> 09:11.875
Peter said nothing.

09:11.875 --> 09:14.166
"Answer me!" Ernie barked.
"You understand?"

09:14.166 --> 09:16.916
"Yes," Peter Watson said quietly.
"I understand that."

09:17.791 --> 09:19.625
Tears were running down Peter's face

09:19.625 --> 09:22.041
as he went down the bank
and entered the water.

09:22.041 --> 09:25.708
He waded out to the dead swan
and picked it up tenderly with both hands.

09:25.708 --> 09:29.291
Underneath were two tiny cygnets,
their bodies covered with gray down.

09:29.291 --> 09:31.625
They were huddling
in the center of the nest.

09:31.625 --> 09:34.000
"Any eggs?" Ernie shouted from the bank.

09:38.625 --> 09:41.000
"No," Peter answered. "Nothing."

09:46.250 --> 09:48.916
He carried the dead swan
back to the edge of the lake.

09:48.916 --> 09:52.791
He placed it gently on the ground,
and he stood up and faced the two others.

09:52.791 --> 09:56.041
His eyes, still wet with tears,
were blazing with fury.

09:56.041 --> 09:58.541
"It's you who ought to be dead," he said.

09:58.541 --> 10:02.041
Ernie seemed just a tiny bit taken aback,
but he quickly recovered.

10:02.041 --> 10:05.250
A dangerous little spark
danced in his small black eyes.

10:07.500 --> 10:09.000
"Give me your knife, Raymond."

10:11.625 --> 10:14.541
There is a joint in the bone
where the wing meets the bird.

10:14.541 --> 10:18.125
Ernie slid the knife into the joint
and cut through the tendon.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.916
The knife was sharp and cut well,

10:19.916 --> 10:22.333
and soon the wing came away
all in one piece.

10:22.333 --> 10:25.083
Ernie turned the swan over
and severed the other wing.

10:25.083 --> 10:27.666
"String," he said,
holding out his hand to Raymond.

10:30.208 --> 10:32.541
Ernie cut eight pieces,
each about a yard long.

10:32.541 --> 10:36.041
He tied the bits of string
along the top edge of the great wing.

10:36.041 --> 10:37.375
"Stick out your arms."

10:40.625 --> 10:43.083
Peter Watson stood in the sunshine
beside the lake

10:43.083 --> 10:44.708
on this beautiful May morning,

10:44.708 --> 10:47.125
the enormous, limp,
slightly bloodied wings

10:47.125 --> 10:49.500
dangling grotesquely at his sides.

10:49.500 --> 10:52.583
Ernie clapped his hands
and danced a little jig on the grass.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.125
[lively instrumental music playing]

10:59.625 --> 11:01.916
"Have you finished?" Peter Watson asked.

11:01.916 --> 11:04.500
"Swans don't talk," Ernie said.

11:04.500 --> 11:08.583
They marched along the bank of the lake
until they came to a tall willow tree.

11:08.583 --> 11:10.791
The branches hung down from a great height

11:10.791 --> 11:13.375
until they almost touched
the surface of the lake.

11:14.083 --> 11:15.708
"What you're gonna do, Mr. Swan,

11:15.708 --> 11:17.958
is climb to the top,
and when you get there,

11:17.958 --> 11:20.333
you'll spread out your wings
and take off!"

11:20.333 --> 11:22.250
"Fantastic!" cried Raymond.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.750
The thought of being high up

11:23.750 --> 11:26.916
and out of reach of these hooligans
appealed to Peter greatly.

11:26.916 --> 11:29.083
When he was up there, he'd stay up there.

11:29.083 --> 11:31.666
He doubted
they would bother to come up after him.

11:31.666 --> 11:34.083
If they did,
he could climb away on a thin limb

11:34.083 --> 11:36.333
that wouldn't take the weight
of two people.

11:36.333 --> 11:40.291
The tree was fairly easy to climb,
with low branches to give him a start up.

11:40.291 --> 11:42.291
"Higher!" shouted Ernie. "Keep going!"

11:42.291 --> 11:45.541
Peter eventually arrived at a point
where he could go no higher.

11:45.541 --> 11:48.666
His feet were standing
on a branch as thick as a man's wrist,

11:48.666 --> 11:51.166
and this branch
reached far out over the lake,

11:51.166 --> 11:53.041
then curved gracefully downward.

11:53.041 --> 11:55.083
He stood there resting after the climb.

11:55.083 --> 11:58.708
He was very high up, at least 50 feet.
He couldn't see the two boys.

11:58.708 --> 12:01.416
They were no longer
standing at the base of the tree.

12:01.416 --> 12:02.666
"Now listen carefully!"

12:02.666 --> 12:04.583
They had walked away from the tree

12:04.583 --> 12:08.000
to a point where they had a clear view
of the small boy at the top.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.333
Looking down at them now,

12:09.333 --> 12:11.583
Peter Watson realized
how sparse and slender

12:11.583 --> 12:13.333
the leaves of a willow tree were.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.291
They gave him almost no cover at all.

12:15.291 --> 12:17.333
"Start walking out along that branch!"

12:17.333 --> 12:21.291
"Keep goin' till you're out over
the nice muddy water! Then take off"

12:21.291 --> 12:23.125
Peter Watson didn't move.

12:23.125 --> 12:26.125
He kept his eyes on the distant figures
in the field below.

12:26.125 --> 12:28.666
They were standing quite still,
looking up at him.

12:28.666 --> 12:29.958
"I'm gonna count to ten,

12:29.958 --> 12:33.750
if you ain't spread them wings
and flown away, I'm gonna shoot you down."

12:33.750 --> 12:36.291
"That'll make two swans
I've knocked off today."

12:36.291 --> 12:37.791
"Here we go."

12:37.791 --> 12:43.541
"One, two, three, four, five, six!"

12:43.541 --> 12:48.041
Peter Watson remained absolutely still.
Nothing would make him move from now on.

12:48.041 --> 12:51.375
"Seven, eight, nine, ten!"

12:51.375 --> 12:53.916
Peter could see the gun
coming up to the shoulder.

12:53.916 --> 12:55.375
Pointing straight at him.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.041
He heard the crack of the rifle

12:57.041 --> 12:59.875
and the zip of the bullet
as it whistled past his head.

13:01.250 --> 13:03.125
[mimics gunshot, whooshing]

13:03.125 --> 13:05.166
It was frightening, but he didn't move.

13:05.166 --> 13:07.541
He could see Ernie loading the gun.

13:07.541 --> 13:10.708
"Last chance!" yelled Ernie.
"Next one's gonna get you!"

13:10.708 --> 13:11.625
Peter waited.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.416
He watched the boy among the buttercups

13:13.416 --> 13:15.916
in the meadow far below
with the other boy beside him.

13:15.916 --> 13:18.125
The gun came up
once again to the shoulder.

13:18.125 --> 13:21.500
This time he heard the crack
as the bullet hit him in the thigh.

13:21.500 --> 13:24.291
There was no pain,
but the force of it was devastating.

13:24.291 --> 13:27.083
Like someone had whacked him
with a sledgehammer,

13:27.083 --> 13:30.083
and it knocked both feet
off the branch he was standing on.

13:30.083 --> 13:32.125
He scrabbled with his hands to hang on.

13:32.125 --> 13:35.416
The small branch he was holding onto
bent over and split.

13:37.041 --> 13:37.875
[wood cracks]

13:44.583 --> 13:46.708
Some people, when they have taken too much

13:46.708 --> 13:49.041
and been driven
beyond the point of endurance,

13:49.041 --> 13:51.666
simply crumble and collapse and give up.

13:51.666 --> 13:53.916
Others, however, though they are not many,

13:53.916 --> 13:57.541
who will for some reason
always be unconquerable.

13:57.541 --> 14:00.916
You meet them in time of war
and also in time of peace.

14:00.916 --> 14:03.041
They have an indomitable spirit

14:03.041 --> 14:06.625
and nothing, neither pain
nor torture nor threat of death,

14:06.625 --> 14:08.833
will cause them to give up.

14:08.833 --> 14:11.375
Little Peter Watson was one of these.

14:11.375 --> 14:12.958
And as he fought and scrabbled

14:12.958 --> 14:16.041
to prevent himself
from falling out of the top of that tree,

14:16.041 --> 14:19.916
it came to him suddenly
that he was going to win.

14:19.916 --> 14:23.166
He looked up and saw a light
shining over the waters of the lake

14:23.166 --> 14:27.833
that was of such brilliance and beauty
he was unable to look away from it.

14:27.833 --> 14:31.166
The light was beckoning him,
drawing him on,

14:31.166 --> 14:35.166
and he dived towards the light
and spread his wings.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.916
Three different people
reported seeing a great white swan

14:39.916 --> 14:42.083
circling over the village that morning:

14:42.083 --> 14:43.166
a schoolteacher,

14:43.166 --> 14:46.041
a man replacing tiles
on the roof of the chemist's shop,

14:46.041 --> 14:48.458
and a boy playing in a nearby field.

14:48.458 --> 14:51.541
Mrs. Watson,
washing dishes in her kitchen sink,

14:51.541 --> 14:54.791
happened to glance up
through the window at the exact moment

14:54.791 --> 14:57.291
something huge and white
came crashing down

14:57.291 --> 14:59.916
onto the lawn in her back garden.

14:59.916 --> 15:01.666
She rushed outside.

15:01.666 --> 15:02.958
She dropped to her knees

15:02.958 --> 15:05.625
beside the small crumpled figure
of her only son.

15:06.500 --> 15:09.500
"My darling!" she cried. "My darling boy!

15:11.875 --> 15:13.125
"What's happened to you?"
