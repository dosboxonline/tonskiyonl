00:44.627 --> 00:50.008
The legend of the ten rings
has been told for thousands of years.

00:51.968 --> 00:56.431
Every generation,
the story grows.

00:56.598 --> 01:01.394
But at its center,
there is always one man.

01:10.111 --> 01:16.951
Some say he found the rings in a crater
or stole them from a tomb.

01:19.704 --> 01:22.540
They gave him the strength of a god,

01:22.707 --> 01:26.211
and the gift of eternal life.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.387
He could have used them for good.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.977
But all he wanted...

01:43.144 --> 01:44.854
was power.

02:26.938 --> 02:30.483
He called his army The Ten Rings.

02:32.694 --> 02:37.824
Over the centuries, they spread
into every corner of the world.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.959
They moved in the shadows...

02:50.336 --> 02:52.380
Toppled governments...

02:54.924 --> 02:56.968
And changed the course of history.

03:13.193 --> 03:17.488
He chased money and power
for a thousand years.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.451
But he still wanted more.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.541
Have you heard the legend of Ta Lo?

03:29.959 --> 03:34.839
A hidden village with mythical creatures
and ancient magic.

03:35.006 --> 03:39.969
Where people practice
a martial arts style from the gods.

03:40.261 --> 03:42.013
I want to find it.

03:42.180 --> 03:45.642
Of course. I'll send a scout
to explore the area,

03:45.808 --> 03:48.436
and come back
with more information.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.774
I want to go now.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.340
The forest...

04:19.300 --> 04:21.928
...is moving.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.837
He had nothing left
on Earth to conquer.

04:59.966 --> 05:04.470
That's when he came
for my home.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.815
Where's the entrance
to Ta Lo?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.861
You're not welcome
in our village.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.573
You don't know who
you're talking to.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.825
I don't care who you are.

05:26.534 --> 05:30.371
Turn around now,
and I won't have to hurt you.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.340
Is that all?

07:59.812 --> 08:02.315
That was the first time
I met your father.

08:06.068 --> 08:09.822
He was the last person
I thought I'd fall for.

08:11.741 --> 08:14.577
But love had other plans.

08:18.247 --> 08:20.541
Shang-Chi,

08:20.708 --> 08:23.503
there's much more to know
about the legend of the rings,

08:23.669 --> 08:27.465
but you'll learn about that
when you're older.

08:28.132 --> 08:33.346
If Dad's rings were so powerful,
how did you beat him?

08:35.056 --> 08:41.854
Where I'm from, we are empowered
by the magic of the Great Protector.

08:46.567 --> 08:49.195
When you have the heart
of our dragon,

08:49.362 --> 08:52.406
you can do some amazing things.

08:52.990 --> 08:55.868
Can you still do those things?

08:57.745 --> 09:01.958
I left those powers in Ta Lo
with our dragon,

09:02.124 --> 09:05.586
but what I got in return
is so much better.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.842
I want you to have this.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.846
Whenever you feel lost,

09:16.013 --> 09:19.016
this will help you
find your way home.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.269
Can you remember that?

09:41.247 --> 09:42.456
Okay.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.650
-

10:44.602 --> 10:45.603
Hello, sir,

10:45.728 --> 10:48.064
-welcome to the Fairmont...
-

10:48.564 --> 10:49.565
I'm driving.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.192
No, you're not... Katy.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.235
Hey, hey, get back here.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.362
Give me the key.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.199
Please open the door.

10:58.282 --> 11:00.826
-Oh, my God.

11:01.118 --> 11:02.953
-Get out.
-You get in!

11:03.037 --> 11:04.080
Look, if happens
to this thing,

11:04.163 --> 11:05.164
we're gonna be jobless

11:05.331 --> 11:06.499
and in debt
for the rest of our lives.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.751
Oh, come on. Nothing's gonna
happen to this car.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.336
I'm the Asian Jeff Gordon.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.671
I don't know who that is.

11:11.837 --> 11:13.631
Most career wins
in all of NASCAR history?

11:13.798 --> 11:15.299
Please get out of the car.

11:15.758 --> 11:16.759
Shaun,

11:16.884 --> 11:18.969
we've been friends
for 10 years, okay?

11:19.136 --> 11:21.180
-You know I'm not an idiot.
-

11:21.639 --> 11:24.392
Please, get in. I'll go slow.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.894
-

11:26.977 --> 11:28.688
- Katy, watch the...

11:35.403 --> 11:36.404
SHAUN: I knew Katy was trouble

11:36.487 --> 11:37.822
the first day we met
in high school.

11:38.030 --> 11:39.073
I was getting picked on a lot,

11:39.156 --> 11:41.075
for all the reasons
we all get picked on a lot.

11:41.575 --> 11:42.952
Plus, I had just moved
to the U.S.,

11:43.035 --> 11:44.495
so I was struggling
with my English,

11:44.662 --> 11:45.746
and I was on my way
to lunch one day

11:45.830 --> 11:47.665
when this guy
who was like twice my size

11:47.748 --> 11:48.749
yells at me
from down the hall,

11:48.833 --> 11:50.126
"What's up, Gangnam Style?"

11:50.876 --> 11:52.753
So I yelled back,
"I'm not Korean, idiot."

11:52.837 --> 11:53.838
And I turn the corner,

11:53.921 --> 11:55.548
and I see this guy
drop his backpack,

11:55.715 --> 11:56.966
he's getting
all up in his face...

11:57.133 --> 11:58.926
And right before he was about
to throw the first punch,

11:59.093 --> 12:00.928
Katy comes out of nowhere,

12:01.095 --> 12:04.348
steps right between us
and starts screaming the lyrics

12:04.432 --> 12:05.850
to Hotel California.

12:06.016 --> 12:07.017
What?

12:07.184 --> 12:09.228
It's the art of confusion.
Works great on stupid people.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.479
SHAUN: And that's how we met.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.064
Then I pulled him
into the parking lot...

12:12.231 --> 12:13.357
At which point she revealed

12:13.441 --> 12:15.735
that she had also swiped
the keys to the guy's Mustang.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.987
Yeah, we went on a little
joyride around the block.

12:18.070 --> 12:19.530
And your wife
was in the car, too.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.323
-That's true. You were.
-What?

12:21.407 --> 12:22.825
I was just in the back seat.

12:22.908 --> 12:23.909
That's a part of the car.

12:23.993 --> 12:25.077
That's still
a part of the car.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.787
How have you
never told me this story?

12:26.954 --> 12:28.122
You know,
before she was a lawyer,

12:28.205 --> 12:29.457
your girl was pretty wild.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.292
Oh! What happened?

12:33.127 --> 12:34.295
I grew up.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.088
What's that supposed to mean?

12:36.172 --> 12:37.173
Yeah, what's that
supposed to mean?

12:37.256 --> 12:38.924
That maybe there's a point

12:39.008 --> 12:40.968
where you're supposed
to stop going on joyrides

12:41.135 --> 12:43.554
and start thinking about
living up to your potential.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.222
Please tell me
you're kidding, Soo.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.390
SOO: Look,

12:46.599 --> 12:47.641
we're now living in a world

12:47.725 --> 12:48.726
where at any moment

12:48.809 --> 12:50.561
half the population
can just disappear.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.564
Life's too short
and too fragile.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.316
Katy, you're a valet driver

12:55.399 --> 12:56.859
with an honors degree
from Berkeley,

12:57.026 --> 12:59.278
and Shaun can speak,
like, four languages.

12:59.445 --> 13:01.363
You've always been the most
talented people I know.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.616
I just don't get why
you're scared

13:03.699 --> 13:05.576
to actually use it
for something serious.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.286
Wow.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.873
You sound like my mom.
You also...

13:11.040 --> 13:12.374
dress like her
a little bit, too.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.502
-Where's this from, Talbots?
-

13:14.585 --> 13:16.504
We're not running
from adulthood.

13:16.670 --> 13:18.964
How is it running to have jobs
that you actually like?

13:19.131 --> 13:20.633
Yeah, that doesn't
even make any sense.

13:20.716 --> 13:23.093
Did you think
valet parking is easy?

13:23.260 --> 13:25.179
It's like the most
challenging job ever.

13:25.262 --> 13:27.515
You need people skills,
driving skills...

13:27.723 --> 13:29.225
KATY: Soo can't even
parallel park.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.564
Well, it's almost midnight.
We got the early shift.

13:36.148 --> 13:38.734
Should probably be
responsible, go to sleep.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.611
Yeah, we can be responsible.
We can do that.

13:40.778 --> 13:42.238
Or...

13:42.404 --> 13:46.116
Over,
sideways and under on a...

13:46.283 --> 13:48.494
Take my horse
to the old town road

13:48.577 --> 13:49.578
I'm gonna

13:49.662 --> 13:51.789
Close my eyes

13:52.540 --> 13:53.624
I don't wanna...

14:27.533 --> 14:28.659
Morning, Mrs. Chen.

14:28.826 --> 14:29.952
She's not ready yet.

14:30.119 --> 14:31.787
Come have some joe
while you wait.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.416
Katy, Shaun's here.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.334
Yeah, Mom,
be there in a minute.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.419
Ruihua,

14:38.502 --> 14:41.005
you're supposed to be helping
your dad stock the shop.

14:41.171 --> 14:44.341
Mom, I can't work on an empty
stomach, my legs get crampy.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.885
Maybe Shaun can help him

14:45.968 --> 14:48.178
instead of just showing up
every day to eat our food.

14:48.345 --> 14:49.555
I'm happy to help.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.433
No, it's Ruihua's job,
let him do it.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.143
Waipo.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.937
That seat's for Waigong.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.106
Oh, sorry.

14:59.189 --> 15:04.612
He's getting all his favorite things
this year for the Day of the Dead.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.363
Are you sure
that Waigong's allowed to take

15:06.447 --> 15:07.448
Funyuns and cigarettes

15:07.531 --> 15:08.741
back to the afterlife?

15:08.824 --> 15:10.576
He can take anything.

15:10.743 --> 15:14.747
Last year I put a bottle of whiskey
on his grave...

15:15.122 --> 15:16.832
And it was gone the next morning.

15:18.167 --> 15:21.420
I know you kids think it's silly.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.297
We don't think
it's silly, Waipo.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.966
We just know Waigong would've
wanted you to move on

15:26.050 --> 15:27.134
and enjoy your life.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.428
"Moving on"
is an American idea.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.764
You're American, Mom!
Don't forget.

15:32.348 --> 15:33.349
MRS. CHEN: Shaun,

15:33.515 --> 15:36.685
did my daughter apply
to any new jobs this week?

15:36.852 --> 15:38.604
She really likes her job.

15:38.771 --> 15:39.855
We both do.

15:39.939 --> 15:40.940
KATY: Mm-hmm.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.816
Waigong didn't move here
from Hunan

15:42.983 --> 15:44.526
so you could park cars
for a living.

15:46.487 --> 15:47.571
Well, on that note,

15:47.655 --> 15:49.114
I think we're gonna
miss our bus.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.240
SHAUN: Mm.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.076
KATY: I'm sorry
for my unacceptable job.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.535
And for staying out late
last night,

15:53.619 --> 15:55.162
trying to enjoy my life.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.498
But one day, I'll make you
proud, I promise.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.041
I'm proud of you, sis.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.669
Parking cars is super hard.

16:01.877 --> 16:02.878
Thanks, bro.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.213
Maybe one day you'll pass
your driver's test,

16:04.296 --> 16:05.297
live the dream like me.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.465
Come on, Shaun, let's go.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.843
-

16:09.927 --> 16:11.887
When are you two going
to get married?

16:11.971 --> 16:13.263
Waipo, we're just friends.

16:14.431 --> 16:17.101
All right. Go, go, go.

16:24.775 --> 16:26.944
Look. Look at that.
Look at that girl.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.029
She's writing a research paper
on a bus.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.531
SHAUN: So?

16:30.614 --> 16:32.032
That is exactly the daughter

16:32.116 --> 16:33.867
my mom wishes
came out of her vagina.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.579
I'm sorry about her.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.165
How's it goin'?

16:44.211 --> 16:46.505
Give me the pendant,

16:46.672 --> 16:48.799
and no one gets hurt.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.968
Do you know this guy?

16:52.428 --> 16:54.096
I don't know what
you're talking about, dude.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.808
-Hey! Get off of me!
-KATY: Whoa.

16:58.517 --> 17:00.019
What is wrong with you,
asshole?

17:00.144 --> 17:02.229
I don't want any trouble.

17:02.312 --> 17:04.148
Then give us the pendant!

17:04.314 --> 17:05.983
You have the wrong guy!

17:06.150 --> 17:07.401
Does he look like
he can fight?

17:18.370 --> 17:19.371
You okay?

17:35.054 --> 17:36.930
Yo, what up, y'all?
It's your boy Klev,

17:37.097 --> 17:38.766
comin' at you live on the bus.

17:38.932 --> 17:40.225
I actually did take

17:40.309 --> 17:42.144
a little bit of martial arts
as a youth,

17:42.352 --> 17:45.105
so I'm gonna try and grade
this fight as we're goin'.

17:54.531 --> 17:57.034
-

17:58.994 --> 18:00.496
Holy shit.

18:01.705 --> 18:03.123
Who are you?

18:17.930 --> 18:19.014
You got this, bro!

18:22.976 --> 18:23.977
My bad.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.910
-

18:48.293 --> 18:49.378
-

18:49.461 --> 18:50.629
No, no, no!

18:52.047 --> 18:53.215
-Sorry.
-

18:55.050 --> 18:56.093
What the hell's going on?

18:56.218 --> 18:57.302
You really wanna talk
about this now?

18:57.386 --> 18:58.971
-

19:04.643 --> 19:06.019
KLEV: Bus driver is down.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.354
I'm not gonna handle this.

19:07.521 --> 19:09.773
Every time I've tried to drive
a bus, I get yelled at.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.044
Go, you freak!

20:23.388 --> 20:24.681
Open the door, please!

20:28.644 --> 20:30.103
The back is about to go.

20:30.270 --> 20:32.314
On my signal,
make a hard right.

20:32.481 --> 20:33.482
What signal?

21:02.970 --> 21:04.388
Everybody to the front now!

21:05.764 --> 21:07.099
WOMAN: Go! Go, go, go.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.893
What's up, y'all? What's up,
y'all? What's up, y'all?

21:21.196 --> 21:23.615
You and your sister
deserve what's coming.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.058
Hold on, everybody!

21:50.309 --> 21:51.310
Oh, God.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.445
Oh, my God!

22:14.333 --> 22:15.959
KATY: Sorry. Heh.

22:16.752 --> 22:18.086
We make a good team.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.868
Shaun. Hey.

22:50.702 --> 22:52.621
You need to tell me
what the hell's going on.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.373
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

22:54.539 --> 22:56.208
-Macau.
-Macau?

22:56.291 --> 22:57.584
Those guys are going
after my sister next,

22:57.667 --> 22:58.668
and I have to
get to her first.

22:59.503 --> 23:00.879
You have a sister?

23:01.046 --> 23:02.047
Look, I know
this is confusing.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.382
I'll explain it
when I get back, I promise.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.466
No, no.

23:04.549 --> 23:05.634
Hell no, dude.

23:05.801 --> 23:06.968
This is bullshit!

23:07.135 --> 23:09.471
I have been by your side
for half your life.

23:09.638 --> 23:11.640
I get there are things you
never wanted to talk about,

23:11.723 --> 23:13.183
and I never wanted to push.

23:13.683 --> 23:16.353
But a guy with a freaking
machete for an arm

23:16.520 --> 23:18.438
just chopped
our bus in half, Shaun!

23:18.605 --> 23:20.232
Who the hell are you?

23:28.323 --> 23:30.992
My sister sent me this
a few months ago.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.328
I think it's the address
of where she's staying.

23:34.996 --> 23:39.084
Those guys back there
were sent by my dad.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.252
What?

23:41.336 --> 23:42.629
If they hurt her...

23:47.509 --> 23:49.428
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

23:54.057 --> 23:55.058
Fine.

23:55.225 --> 23:56.643
You can explain on the plane.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.145
What?
No, Katy, you can't just...

23:58.311 --> 24:00.021
You can explain
on the plane, Shaun!

24:07.404 --> 24:09.406
-

24:23.837 --> 24:25.130
SHAUN: After my mom died...

24:26.590 --> 24:28.091
my dad started my training.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.027
SHAUN: From sunup to sundown,

24:47.194 --> 24:49.613
I was taught every possible
way to kill a man.

25:39.746 --> 25:40.747
By the time I was 14,

25:40.830 --> 25:41.831
I could barely remember

25:41.915 --> 25:43.375
what life was like
before she died.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.003
That's how old I was

25:47.087 --> 25:48.964
when he sent me
on my first assignment.

25:51.466 --> 25:53.802
I was willing to do
anything he wanted.

25:54.594 --> 25:55.845
If he asked me
to burn the world down,

25:55.929 --> 25:56.930
I would've asked him...

25:57.013 --> 25:58.098
FLIGHT ATTENDANT:
Beef or vegetarian?

26:00.642 --> 26:01.643
We're all out of the chicken,

26:01.726 --> 26:03.979
so I can only offer you
beef or vegetarian?

26:04.521 --> 26:05.647
BOTH: Um...

26:05.730 --> 26:08.149
-Vegetarian would be great.
-Yeah, same.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.317
-FLIGHT ATTENDANT: Okay.
-Thank you.

26:10.527 --> 26:11.528
So...

26:11.695 --> 26:14.072
Oh, we're out
of the vegetarian too.

26:14.656 --> 26:15.865
Now we only have beef.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.952
Beef. 'Cause that's all
you have, right?

26:19.119 --> 26:20.328
-Okay, you'll have the beef.
-Yes.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.413
-And...
-Beef.

26:21.496 --> 26:23.456
-And the beef.
-Two beefs.

26:29.504 --> 26:30.922
Did you go through with it?

26:38.305 --> 26:40.974
I knew that I couldn't
go back to him, so I just...

26:42.851 --> 26:44.060
ran.

26:48.815 --> 26:51.359
I know this is a lot
to dump on you.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.949
I'm sorry about your mom.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.832
I should also probably mention

27:05.915 --> 27:08.793
that my name's
not technically Shaun.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.171
What?

27:12.213 --> 27:13.214
What is it?

27:13.923 --> 27:16.092
It's Shang-Chi.

27:16.676 --> 27:17.802
Shaun-Chi.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.346
No. Shang-Chi.

27:19.679 --> 27:20.889
Shaun-Chi.

27:21.514 --> 27:22.515
Shang.

27:22.682 --> 27:23.683
-Shaun.
-Shang.

27:24.225 --> 27:25.226
Shan.

27:25.393 --> 27:27.395
S-H-A-N-G. Shang.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.356
Shang?

27:29.522 --> 27:30.523
Yeah.

27:30.690 --> 27:33.902
You changed your name
from Shang to Shaun?

27:34.069 --> 27:35.945
Yeah, I don't... Yeah.

27:36.112 --> 27:37.614
I wonder how
your father found you.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.199
Okay, I was 15 years old.
All right?

27:39.282 --> 27:41.242
What is your
name change logic?

27:41.326 --> 27:42.452
You're going into hiding.

27:42.619 --> 27:43.953
-Okay.
-And your name is Michael,

27:44.037 --> 27:45.872
you go on
and change it to Mishael.

27:46.122 --> 27:48.083
That's not what happened.

27:48.249 --> 27:49.417
It's like,
"Hi, my name's Gina.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.461
"I'm gonna go into hiding.
My new name's Gina."

27:51.628 --> 27:52.629
Can't hear you. I'm sorry.

27:52.712 --> 27:54.297
Yeah, okay.
Oh, yeah, you can hear me.

28:36.339 --> 28:38.925
Sign here to get in.

28:42.846 --> 28:45.306
I'm looking for my sister,
Xu Xialing.

28:45.557 --> 28:47.642
Have you heard of her?

28:49.352 --> 28:51.604
This is the address she gave me.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.193
Okay.

28:58.445 --> 29:00.363
Seems like a nice fella.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.365
And this elevator
is definitely up to code.

29:02.449 --> 29:03.700
There's absolutely no chance
of it just falling off

29:03.783 --> 29:04.784
the side of the building...

29:04.868 --> 29:06.244
-

29:08.621 --> 29:09.622
Bus Boy!

29:10.123 --> 29:11.499
-Uh...
-

29:11.583 --> 29:15.044
Two million views
in three days, bro!

29:15.128 --> 29:16.212
Damn, dude.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.630
Oh, no.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.717
And you're the driver!

29:22.677 --> 29:24.345
Oh, my Chinese sucks.

29:24.679 --> 29:25.680
Oh, all good.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.390
-I speak A-B-C.
-Oh, great.

29:27.557 --> 29:28.933
-I'm Jon Jon.
-Jon Jon.

29:29.142 --> 29:32.103
Welcome
to the Golden Daggers Club.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.773
Okay,
let's get you ready to fight.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.024
Wait. What?

29:36.191 --> 29:38.693
We're a multi-platform
global operation.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.987
Every fight livestreamed
on the dark web.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.656
Thousands of viewers
placing bets as we speak.

29:43.865 --> 29:46.034
This is gonna take your brand
to a whole new level.

29:46.201 --> 29:47.744
Think there's been
some sort of confusion.

29:47.827 --> 29:49.078
I like your spike face.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.163
Thanks!

29:50.288 --> 29:51.915
Usually, you gotta
fight your way to center ring,

29:51.998 --> 29:53.041
but a viral star like you?

29:53.208 --> 29:54.209
Front of line, baby.

29:54.375 --> 29:55.794
I'm not here
to fight anybody. Okay?

29:56.002 --> 29:57.420
I'm looking
for my sister, Xu Xialing.

29:57.629 --> 29:58.880
-

29:58.963 --> 29:59.964
Never heard of her.

30:00.089 --> 30:01.925
We just lost a fighter
at the last minute,

30:02.091 --> 30:03.968
so you get the next slot.

30:08.932 --> 30:10.099
-

30:10.683 --> 30:12.101
Nice one, Helen.

30:13.061 --> 30:14.729
Is he gonna be
fighting in one of these?

30:14.813 --> 30:17.899
Oh, no, no, no. These are
like low-level fights.

30:18.066 --> 30:22.320
You're gonna be
fighting up there.

30:34.707 --> 30:37.627
-That hurt, Emil.
-

30:37.710 --> 30:39.754
You want me to show you
how it feels?

30:48.972 --> 30:51.641
Wong! Wong! Wong!

30:51.808 --> 30:54.477
Wong! Wong! Wong!

30:54.644 --> 30:56.145
Go, Wong!

30:56.312 --> 30:57.772
I always bet on Asian.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.399
Oh, my God.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.359
Yeah, look, I'm not
going up there, okay?

31:01.442 --> 31:02.777
-I'm just trying to...
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:02.861 --> 31:03.903
It's too late to back out now.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.655
-You already committed, bro.
-SHANG-CHI: What?

31:05.738 --> 31:07.782
JON JON: You signed
the contract, remember?

31:07.949 --> 31:09.284
Your name's on the roster.

31:09.492 --> 31:11.202
The bets are piling in.

31:11.369 --> 31:13.413
-Really? What's our cut?
-Oh, it's huge.

31:13.580 --> 31:14.581
It doesn't matter.

31:14.747 --> 31:15.832
It matters.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.710
Dude, I saw you
fight five assassins

31:18.793 --> 31:20.753
and a giant Romanian
with a razor for an arm

31:20.920 --> 31:22.213
on a moving bus.

31:22.380 --> 31:23.590
This is just one guy.

31:23.756 --> 31:26.217
Just do it.
Then we all get paid,

31:26.384 --> 31:29.304
and then I'll help you find
whoever you're looking for.

31:29.512 --> 31:30.972
Come on. You got this.

31:31.055 --> 31:32.432
-JON JON: You got this.
-Don't be nervous.

31:32.599 --> 31:33.600
Thank you.

31:33.683 --> 31:34.767
-KATY: Yeah.
-Yeah.

31:41.900 --> 31:44.027
-How's the jaw?
-

31:46.154 --> 31:48.156
Maybe you'll start
controlling those punches

31:48.239 --> 31:49.574
like we practiced?

31:55.079 --> 31:56.414
Love that guy.

31:57.957 --> 31:59.542
Now take your shirt off.

31:59.667 --> 32:01.836
-JON JON: Ladies and gentlemen,

32:01.920 --> 32:04.255
the fight we've all
been waiting for.

32:04.714 --> 32:07.133
The incredible
viral sensation,

32:07.300 --> 32:11.262
all the way
from San Francisco, USA,

32:11.679 --> 32:14.682
it's Bus Boy!

32:18.686 --> 32:20.480
What happened to your shirt?

32:24.943 --> 32:27.570
JON JON: And his opponent
for tonight,

32:28.112 --> 32:31.157
it's Macau's
own fearsome killer...

32:33.451 --> 32:37.455
Xu Xialing!

32:42.168 --> 32:43.503
Sister.

32:45.421 --> 32:46.589
Wait, wait!

32:48.758 --> 32:49.801
What are you doing?

32:56.933 --> 32:58.559
I know you're upset.

32:58.726 --> 33:00.228
But can you hear me out?

33:04.232 --> 33:05.984
We don't have time for this.

33:15.284 --> 33:16.577
Ooh, that's gotta hurt.

33:23.292 --> 33:25.586
Can you please stop hitting me?

33:35.930 --> 33:38.933
Stop it! I'm trying to help you!

33:39.559 --> 33:41.728
Dad's coming for you.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.650
I'm not fighting you.

33:48.568 --> 33:50.903
You shouldn't have come back.

33:57.493 --> 34:00.329
Sometimes when I'm doing my forms...

34:01.622 --> 34:03.624
I close my eyes,

34:03.791 --> 34:07.795
and it's like I can feel her.

34:08.588 --> 34:10.882
Do you ever feel like that?

34:12.884 --> 34:14.719
No.

34:18.639 --> 34:20.892
I know
what you're going there to do.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.853
I don't know what
he's telling you, but Mom...

34:24.020 --> 34:25.646
Mom's dead.

34:38.367 --> 34:40.536
Please don't leave me here.

34:47.585 --> 34:50.630
I'll be back in three days.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.863
Xu Xialing, you're amazing!

35:16.030 --> 35:17.698
We love you, Xu Xialing!
Whoo!

35:34.966 --> 35:36.467
You run this place?

35:37.093 --> 35:39.011
I own it.

35:42.181 --> 35:43.766
Where'd you
get all that money?

35:44.976 --> 35:46.435
Did you bet against me?

35:47.186 --> 35:48.187
No.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.107
Hi, Xialing. I'm Katy.

35:51.274 --> 35:52.525
You're, like, such a badass.

35:52.608 --> 35:53.860
Everything that you do is,
like, so cool.

35:54.026 --> 35:55.194
That was really cool.

35:55.820 --> 35:56.821
I like your pants.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.823
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

36:00.533 --> 36:01.742
What do you want?

36:01.909 --> 36:04.162
The Ten Rings ambushed us
in San Francisco.

36:04.328 --> 36:05.496
XIALING: I saw the video.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.039
They took my pendant.

36:08.207 --> 36:09.750
They're gonna come
for yours next.

36:12.545 --> 36:13.880
I don't know
what he wants with them,

36:14.046 --> 36:15.506
but we both know
it can't be good.

36:19.802 --> 36:21.804
You know what he said to me
when he left?

36:22.847 --> 36:25.266
"I'll be back in three days."

36:26.767 --> 36:27.768
And after three days,

36:27.852 --> 36:30.021
I went to our mom's shrine
and waited.

36:32.565 --> 36:34.400
Three days
turned into a week,

36:35.067 --> 36:36.611
a week turned to a month,

36:36.694 --> 36:38.946
and a month
turned to six years.

36:44.410 --> 36:45.870
That's how long
it took me to realize

36:45.953 --> 36:47.663
I didn't need him anymore.

36:49.957 --> 36:52.710
I built this place on my own.

36:53.002 --> 36:56.839
I didn't need you then,
and I don't need you now.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.551
Then why would you
send me the postcard?

37:01.010 --> 37:02.386
XIALING: What postcard?

37:10.519 --> 37:12.063
I didn't send you this.

37:13.689 --> 37:16.108
-

37:19.362 --> 37:20.780
Is there a back exit?

37:21.239 --> 37:22.365
Shaun.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.993
SHANG-CHI: Hey. Hey!
Hey, open up!

37:30.665 --> 37:31.874
She's gone, dude.

37:48.641 --> 37:49.642
What do we do?

37:49.809 --> 37:51.227
What do we do?

37:51.560 --> 37:52.561
Uh...

37:58.734 --> 38:00.111
Come on!

38:05.074 --> 38:07.201
Oh, hell no. Screw you!
I'm not doing this.

38:07.368 --> 38:08.369
If we make it to the elevator,

38:08.452 --> 38:09.662
we can hop in
on the next floor.

38:09.745 --> 38:11.080
-

38:11.163 --> 38:12.999
Katy, we're out of options.
We have to go now.

38:15.918 --> 38:18.212
One, two, three.

38:20.464 --> 38:21.465
KATY: Whoa.

38:23.968 --> 38:25.261
SHANG-CHI: Just head
straight for that elevator.

38:26.387 --> 38:27.555
You got this.

38:39.442 --> 38:41.027
I'll buy you some time.
Just keep going.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.521
-

39:31.243 --> 39:33.454
On a dark desert highway

39:34.205 --> 39:36.123
Cool wind in my hair

39:45.091 --> 39:46.258
Shaun!

39:49.095 --> 39:51.514
Shaun! Shaun!

39:54.975 --> 39:56.727
Oh, my God! Ohhh!

40:01.732 --> 40:02.775
SHANG-CHI: I'm coming!

40:08.030 --> 40:09.281
KATY: Shaun!

40:10.449 --> 40:11.617
SHANG-CHI: Hang on.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.122
Gotcha.

40:16.622 --> 40:17.623
Shaun!

40:19.375 --> 40:20.668
Katy!

40:45.067 --> 40:46.569
You left us for dead!

40:48.654 --> 40:50.614
Now you know how it feels.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.010
What does
he want with the pendant...

41:17.099 --> 41:18.726
Did America make you soft?

41:20.186 --> 41:21.937
-

41:33.699 --> 41:35.117
XIALING: He has the pendant!

42:38.472 --> 42:40.474
-

42:59.201 --> 43:00.202
I told my men

43:00.286 --> 43:03.622
they wouldn't be able
to kill you if they tried.

43:04.873 --> 43:06.333
Glad I was right.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.675
I've missed you, my son.

43:18.887 --> 43:20.347
Let's go home.

44:19.156 --> 44:20.532
My son is home.

44:25.120 --> 44:26.580
Take the girls to their room.

44:37.257 --> 44:39.885
I've seen some really
scary stuff this week,

44:40.052 --> 44:43.055
but your dad's on,
like, a whole 'nother level.

44:44.765 --> 44:46.475
Is he gonna kill us?

44:47.851 --> 44:51.397
Just nod. Don't talk.
He'll forget you're there.

44:51.939 --> 44:53.816
That's how I survived.

44:54.900 --> 44:56.819
He always treat you like that?

44:58.737 --> 45:00.906
Only after my mom died.

45:02.866 --> 45:07.287
He said he couldn't look at me
because I reminded him of her.

45:08.872 --> 45:11.083
I wasn't allowed to train
with the boys.

45:12.376 --> 45:14.128
But I watched
everything they did

45:14.211 --> 45:16.255
and taught myself
to do it better.

45:18.590 --> 45:19.967
When did you leave?

45:20.134 --> 45:22.386
I ran away when I was 16.

45:22.803 --> 45:25.431
As soon as I knew
my brother wasn't coming back.

45:26.348 --> 45:29.351
You started an underground
fight ring in Macau

45:29.977 --> 45:31.729
when you were 16 years old?

45:33.188 --> 45:36.150
If my dad won't let me
into his empire,

45:36.233 --> 45:37.693
I'm gonna build my own.

45:38.986 --> 45:40.320
Hell yeah.

46:06.680 --> 46:07.681
MAN: Shang-Chi.

46:10.225 --> 46:12.102
That's enough.

46:18.400 --> 46:20.861
Have you been
practicing your English?

46:23.030 --> 46:24.156
Yes.

46:26.158 --> 46:29.828
You have to strengthen your
mind along with your body.

46:36.210 --> 46:39.755
If you want them
to be yours one day,

46:39.922 --> 46:43.842
you have to show me you're
strong enough to carry them.

47:01.443 --> 47:02.945
How did you find me?

47:03.737 --> 47:05.989
I always know
where my children are.

47:06.949 --> 47:08.784
I gave you 10 years
to live your life,

47:08.867 --> 47:10.160
and where did it get you?

47:13.413 --> 47:17.251
Now it's time for you
to take your place by my side.

47:18.252 --> 47:20.587
That's not gonna happen.

47:24.091 --> 47:25.717
MAN: American girl.

47:25.884 --> 47:27.010
Her name is Katy.

47:28.303 --> 47:29.972
What is your Chinese name?

47:33.976 --> 47:35.269
Ruiwen.

47:36.311 --> 47:38.480
Names are sacred, Ruiwen.

47:38.647 --> 47:40.649
They connect us
not only to ourselves,

47:40.732 --> 47:42.526
but to everyone
who came before.

47:43.986 --> 47:45.654
A funny story.

47:45.821 --> 47:48.282
Some years ago,
a terrorist from America

47:48.365 --> 47:49.783
needed a boogeyman

47:49.950 --> 47:52.578
to bring your country
to its knees.

47:52.744 --> 47:55.414
So, he appropriated
The Ten Rings.

47:55.497 --> 47:56.498
My Ten Rings.

47:56.582 --> 47:59.084
But because
he didn't know my actual name,

47:59.167 --> 48:00.544
he invented a new one.

48:01.169 --> 48:03.130
Do you know the name he chose?

48:04.965 --> 48:06.508
The Mandarin.

48:06.675 --> 48:09.636
He gave his figurehead
the name of a chicken dish.

48:10.053 --> 48:11.471
And it worked.

48:11.638 --> 48:13.432
America was terrified.

48:14.308 --> 48:15.893
Of an orange.

48:17.686 --> 48:18.979
The truth is,

48:19.146 --> 48:22.024
I've had many names
throughout my life.

48:22.733 --> 48:25.152
The Warrior King, Master Khan,

48:25.235 --> 48:27.362
the most dangerous man
on Earth.

48:27.696 --> 48:31.742
For years, I thought that was
all I was meant to be.

48:34.578 --> 48:37.456
But when I met their mother,

48:38.206 --> 48:40.000
everything changed.

48:54.222 --> 48:57.851
She showed me a part of myself
I didn't know was there.

49:00.604 --> 49:03.482
It was like I was seeing
the world for the first time.

49:13.659 --> 49:17.204
She gave up everything
so we could be together.

49:20.457 --> 49:22.125
And so did I.

49:23.669 --> 49:25.337
-

49:37.182 --> 49:38.850
You know who's in there?

49:39.017 --> 49:40.852
Say, "Hello, little sister!"

49:47.317 --> 49:48.777
MANDARIN:
After all those years,

49:48.860 --> 49:50.445
I finally found something

49:50.612 --> 49:52.781
worth growing old for.

49:58.245 --> 50:00.622
My real name is Wenwu.

50:01.456 --> 50:04.042
She was the only one
who called me that.

50:05.711 --> 50:07.504
And when she died...

50:10.716 --> 50:13.051
I was lost for many years.

50:15.762 --> 50:17.764
But I'm not lost anymore.

50:22.144 --> 50:23.603
When you children ran away,

50:23.770 --> 50:26.314
I was so desperate
to connect with your mother,

50:26.481 --> 50:29.693
I threw myself back into
the studies of her village.

50:30.277 --> 50:32.070
The legendary Ta Lo.

50:33.280 --> 50:34.448
I wasn't able

50:34.531 --> 50:36.783
to find the secret path
to the village entrance,

50:36.950 --> 50:40.495
but I did find
what they are hiding.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.582
There's a gate
deep in their mountains.

50:44.249 --> 50:46.918
Your mother
is waiting for us there.

50:49.880 --> 50:51.506
I know this is a lot.

50:51.715 --> 50:55.552
I might not have believed it
if she didn't tell me herself.

50:56.386 --> 50:58.013
What are you talking about?

50:58.513 --> 51:00.599
I was sitting right here
in this seat,

51:01.016 --> 51:03.060
deep in my research...

51:04.269 --> 51:06.146
and she spoke to me.

51:06.938 --> 51:09.691
It was like
she was standing in this room.

51:09.858 --> 51:12.694
I could feel her breath
on my cheek

51:12.778 --> 51:14.738
and her hand on my back.

51:16.281 --> 51:18.533
She told me she needs my help.

51:20.285 --> 51:21.495
To do what?

51:22.287 --> 51:24.664
To save her from her people.

51:27.834 --> 51:29.669
After we fell in love,

51:29.753 --> 51:32.464
your mother wanted us
to live in Ta Lo.

51:32.631 --> 51:34.633
She asked permission
from the elders,

51:34.716 --> 51:35.884
and they refused.

51:36.051 --> 51:38.261
They said I wasn't worthy.

51:40.055 --> 51:41.389
She would still be with us.

51:41.473 --> 51:44.101
We would all be
living there together.

51:44.893 --> 51:46.603
Ta Lo did this to us.

51:48.396 --> 51:51.024
They locked her behind
that gate to punish her.

51:55.445 --> 51:56.696
Don't you see?

51:57.656 --> 51:59.741
She's leaving clues for us.

51:59.908 --> 52:01.368
She wants us to find her

52:01.535 --> 52:04.287
and bring her home,
so we can be a family again.

52:05.163 --> 52:07.833
Dad, Mom's gone.

52:09.167 --> 52:11.128
She's not talking to you
from behind a gate,

52:11.211 --> 52:13.505
and she's not leaving
any clues for us.

52:18.844 --> 52:21.012
Then what are these?

53:07.350 --> 53:11.021
The passage to Ta Lo
is guarded by a moving maze.

53:12.063 --> 53:15.192
But there's a direct path
through the forest

53:15.275 --> 53:17.360
that only opens once a year

53:17.527 --> 53:19.446
on Qingming Jie.

53:20.405 --> 53:22.949
To get through,
you need to know the route

53:23.033 --> 53:25.410
and the exact time it opens.

53:29.831 --> 53:31.458
Now I know both.

53:43.220 --> 53:45.263
Three days from now,

53:45.430 --> 53:47.807
we will rescue
my wife from her prison

53:47.891 --> 53:49.100
and bring her home.

53:55.774 --> 53:57.442
This is why you're here.

53:58.360 --> 53:59.945
To help me
bring her back to us.

54:00.528 --> 54:02.822
And what happens if they don't
let you open the gate?

54:04.449 --> 54:07.869
We'll burn the village
to the ground.

54:09.913 --> 54:10.914
What?

54:13.625 --> 54:15.919
You can't just march
into our mom's village

54:16.002 --> 54:17.420
with this bullshit.

54:17.837 --> 54:19.297
I mean, do you have
any idea how insane...

54:24.636 --> 54:25.637
Hey!

54:28.515 --> 54:31.059
Where are you taking me?

54:32.435 --> 54:34.729
When will you stop pretending?

54:37.440 --> 54:38.608
Lock them up.

54:58.253 --> 55:01.423
It's okay, my dear.

55:08.346 --> 55:12.517
We're all going to be
together soon.

55:21.109 --> 55:25.905
So, um,
pretty confused right now,

55:26.072 --> 55:29.617
because, uh, initially
I thought your dad should

55:29.826 --> 55:31.745
definitely see a therapist
for his delusions,

55:31.953 --> 55:35.540
but then that dragon
vomited a magical water map,

55:36.291 --> 55:38.668
and now I have no idea
what's real.

55:41.087 --> 55:43.423
Is what he said
about your mom's village true?

55:47.135 --> 55:48.553
She used to tell us stories
about Ta Lo

55:48.636 --> 55:49.637
when we were kids.

55:50.680 --> 55:54.893
A village in another dimension
full of magical creatures.

55:54.976 --> 55:56.978
I thought
it was just a fairy tale.

55:58.938 --> 56:00.774
What if Dad's right?

56:02.567 --> 56:03.902
About Mom being locked
behind a gate

56:03.985 --> 56:05.945
by her own people?

56:06.112 --> 56:08.365
Crazier things
have turned out to be true.

56:09.574 --> 56:11.743
Look, I don't know
what the hell is going on,

56:11.910 --> 56:14.329
but if we don't find a way
to get to Ta Lo before him,

56:14.496 --> 56:16.915
he's gonna destroy everything
that's left of our family.

56:19.209 --> 56:22.087
This family was destroyed
a long time ago.

56:26.383 --> 56:28.051
The hell was that?

56:28.134 --> 56:30.303
-Oh.

56:30.387 --> 56:32.639
You're going
toward that noise?

56:52.158 --> 56:55.453
"Wake Duncan
with thy knocking.

56:55.620 --> 56:58.581
"Oh, I would'st
though could'st.

56:58.748 --> 57:00.291
"My deed 'twere best not..."

57:03.294 --> 57:05.255
Oh, hello, loves.

57:06.381 --> 57:07.841
What year is it?

57:09.342 --> 57:10.718
Who are you?

57:10.885 --> 57:13.012
Trevor? Slattery?

57:13.179 --> 57:15.598
The actor from Liverpool?

57:16.516 --> 57:17.517
Wait.

57:17.684 --> 57:19.227
Are you the governor's kids?

57:19.894 --> 57:21.521
I've been preparing
a monologue

57:21.604 --> 57:23.273
for your homecoming dinner.

57:23.440 --> 57:25.316
Oh. Where's she going?

57:25.483 --> 57:26.651
Why are you down here?

57:26.818 --> 57:28.778
Well, some time ago,

57:28.862 --> 57:30.405
I was offered
the role of a terrorist.

57:30.613 --> 57:32.866
I know, facile, trite,
I couldn't agree more.

57:33.032 --> 57:34.951
But times were lean,
you know what I mean?

57:35.118 --> 57:37.871
Anyway, the producer told me
he worked for the BBC.

57:38.037 --> 57:39.497
But, ironic twist,

57:39.581 --> 57:42.167
it turns out he, in fact,
was a terrorist,

57:42.333 --> 57:43.835
and I wasn't playing
a character at all,

57:44.002 --> 57:45.295
but what I now recognize to be

57:45.378 --> 57:47.338
a rather unflattering portrait
of your father.

57:47.755 --> 57:49.507
We all got our just deserts.

57:49.674 --> 57:51.551
The producer
got blown up by Iron Man,

57:51.634 --> 57:53.303
and I served time
in federal prison,

57:53.470 --> 57:56.306
which turned out
to be the best thing for me.

57:56.389 --> 57:58.808
I got clean,
I rediscovered my passion.

57:58.975 --> 58:01.561
-Then my dad broke you out?
-Exactly.

58:01.728 --> 58:03.813
-To kill you.
-Exactly.

58:04.564 --> 58:06.900
But just as his men

58:06.983 --> 58:09.611
were tying me up
for my execution,

58:09.777 --> 58:11.654
I launched into a performance
of my Macbeth.

58:11.738 --> 58:13.364
"Whence is that knocking?
Wake Duncan

58:13.448 --> 58:14.949
"with thy knocking.
I would'st though could'st..."

58:15.033 --> 58:16.201
They couldn't
get enough of it.

58:16.367 --> 58:18.786
I've been doing weekly gigs
for the lads ever since.

58:18.953 --> 58:20.830
So you're like his jester?

58:20.997 --> 58:22.665
I can give you a quick preview
if you like.

58:22.749 --> 58:24.000
"Nuncle, nuncle, nuncle..."

58:24.167 --> 58:26.461
Uh, thank you, Trevor.
I think we're okay.

58:26.669 --> 58:28.505
Right now, we really just
need to find a way to...

58:28.588 --> 58:30.006
-What the hell?

58:30.089 --> 58:31.216
KATY: What the... Oh!

58:31.299 --> 58:32.342
-Whoa!
-What is that?

58:34.052 --> 58:35.053
What's what?

58:35.220 --> 58:37.013
-That! What is that?
-That! That! That!

58:39.349 --> 58:40.683
You can see Morris?

58:40.850 --> 58:41.851
KATY: Morris?

58:41.935 --> 58:44.604
Oh, Morris!

58:44.771 --> 58:47.106
They can see you! You're real!

58:47.273 --> 58:50.318
All this time I thought
I was hallucinating him.

58:50.485 --> 58:51.986
Oh, this is such fab news.

58:53.071 --> 58:54.072
Where's his face?

58:54.155 --> 58:55.615
-

58:55.698 --> 58:57.367
He's a bit sensitive
about that.

58:58.493 --> 59:00.203
-Oh. Really?

59:01.829 --> 59:03.456
Morris says he knows
who you are.

59:04.165 --> 59:05.500
It talks... It talks to you?

59:05.583 --> 59:07.126
If he didn't talk to me,

59:07.210 --> 59:09.045
I'd have gone mad yonks ago.

59:10.421 --> 59:11.798
SHANG-CHI:
How would he know me?

59:11.965 --> 59:14.801
He says he grew up
with your mum. In Ta Lo.

59:15.677 --> 59:18.763
Apparently, your father picked
him up in some magic forest

59:18.930 --> 59:21.641
on one of his expeditions
to find the entrance.

59:25.311 --> 59:26.896
He wants you to take him home.

59:29.482 --> 59:31.526
Believe me, buddy,
I would if I knew how.

59:32.235 --> 59:33.236
According to my dad,

59:33.319 --> 59:35.071
the path there
only opens once a year.

59:38.575 --> 59:40.743
-

59:41.953 --> 59:44.539
Morris says he can guide you
there right now.

59:44.706 --> 59:45.915
You can get through the maze

59:45.999 --> 59:47.584
without waiting
for the path to open.

59:47.750 --> 59:49.752
But, and it's a big "but,"

59:49.919 --> 59:51.963
it's very dangerous.

59:52.130 --> 59:53.131
How dangerous?

59:53.298 --> 59:55.216
No one's ever
made it out alive.

59:55.383 --> 59:58.177
But Morris is 90% confident

59:58.344 --> 1:00:00.096
he can guide us
through safely.

1:00:00.179 --> 1:00:01.723
-Oh.

1:00:01.806 --> 1:00:03.308
19%.

1:00:05.810 --> 1:00:08.313
Look, I've done dumber things
with worse odds.

1:00:08.479 --> 1:00:10.189
But even if
that chicken-pig is right...

1:00:11.357 --> 1:00:12.358
...we're still locked
in your...

1:00:18.573 --> 1:00:19.699
XIALING: Whew!

1:00:22.660 --> 1:00:23.953
How did you...

1:00:24.120 --> 1:00:26.539
Dad has a tunnel system
under the whole compound.

1:00:26.706 --> 1:00:28.458
That's how
I escaped last time.

1:00:28.625 --> 1:00:29.626
Oh.

1:00:29.709 --> 1:00:31.753
This will take us
straight to the garage.

1:00:43.473 --> 1:00:45.308
KATY: Oh, my God.

1:00:45.475 --> 1:00:46.976
I kinda like this guy.

1:00:47.143 --> 1:00:48.978
Just head up that ramp
and through the front gate.

1:00:49.145 --> 1:00:50.271
Should be a straight shot.

1:00:50.355 --> 1:00:52.065
Figure we got about
30 seconds until he...

1:00:52.231 --> 1:00:53.232
Do you mind?

1:00:53.399 --> 1:00:55.360
I get sick in the back.
Carsick.

1:00:55.443 --> 1:00:56.569
-

1:00:58.571 --> 1:00:59.739
That's my car!

1:01:05.328 --> 1:01:06.329
God damn it.

1:01:06.496 --> 1:01:07.622
Hold on.

1:01:09.123 --> 1:01:10.166
Is there another exit?

1:01:10.249 --> 1:01:11.501
The other end of the garage.

1:01:11.668 --> 1:01:13.169
But we need a fingerprint
to open it.

1:01:19.967 --> 1:01:21.302
Incoming!

1:01:22.679 --> 1:01:23.805
KATY: Shit!

1:01:45.785 --> 1:01:47.161
KATY: What's happening
back there?

1:01:48.496 --> 1:01:49.580
SHANG-CHI: Doing my best.

1:01:49.706 --> 1:01:51.499
AUTOMATED VOICE: Scan
hand print for gate access.

1:01:51.582 --> 1:01:53.876
-Hurry up!
-SHANG-CHI: I'm trying!

1:01:56.212 --> 1:01:57.296
Scan hand print
for gate access.

1:01:57.380 --> 1:01:58.381
Shaun!

1:01:59.549 --> 1:02:01.134
Access approved.

1:02:19.861 --> 1:02:22.280
They will come back
once I bring her home.

1:02:24.115 --> 1:02:25.867
Prepare the men for war.

1:02:26.868 --> 1:02:27.910
Yes, sir.

1:02:32.957 --> 1:02:36.419
TREVOR: The first time
I witnessed pure artistry.

1:02:36.794 --> 1:02:40.548
1968. Planet of the Apes.

1:02:40.715 --> 1:02:42.717
I was sitting in the cinema
next to my mum,

1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:44.260
watching mastery

1:02:44.427 --> 1:02:46.304
unfold before my very eyes.

1:02:46.471 --> 1:02:48.598
After the film, I asked her,

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:51.184
"How did they get those
monkeys to do those things?"

1:02:51.350 --> 1:02:54.145
And she patted me on the head
and she said,

1:02:54.312 --> 1:02:57.190
"It's not real, pet.
It's just acting."

1:02:57.356 --> 1:02:59.066
That's when I knew.

1:03:00.151 --> 1:03:01.569
If they can teach
those monkeys

1:03:01.652 --> 1:03:03.571
to act that brilliantly,

1:03:04.238 --> 1:03:07.492
just imagine what I could
bring to the world.

1:03:08.075 --> 1:03:09.202
So you became an actor

1:03:09.368 --> 1:03:11.287
because you thought
the monkeys were actually...

1:03:11.454 --> 1:03:14.123
Riding horses? I did. Yes.

1:03:14.290 --> 1:03:15.875
When, in fact,

1:03:15.958 --> 1:03:19.045
they were simply acting
as if they were riding horses.

1:03:19.212 --> 1:03:21.422
I still can't get my head
round it, to be honest.

1:03:22.465 --> 1:03:24.258
Good for you, dude.

1:03:24.801 --> 1:03:28.262
You found your passion
and went for it,

1:03:28.429 --> 1:03:29.514
and eventually used it

1:03:29.597 --> 1:03:31.641
to cripple the US government,
but whatever.

1:03:31.808 --> 1:03:33.768
TREVOR: Yeah.
No, yeah, thanks.

1:03:33.851 --> 1:03:35.853
Um, this is really cool
and all,

1:03:35.937 --> 1:03:37.396
but how long
do we have to sit here?

1:03:37.563 --> 1:03:39.023
Morris is very clear.

1:03:39.607 --> 1:03:41.484
The way through
is all about timing.

1:03:41.984 --> 1:03:43.694
Okay, but how long
are we talking?

1:03:43.861 --> 1:03:45.571
Like, hours? Days?

1:03:45.738 --> 1:03:48.366
Friends,
I am but a transitory vessel

1:03:48.449 --> 1:03:49.867
for the infinite wisdom
of a creature

1:03:50.034 --> 1:03:52.286
far more advanced than
we'll ever truly understand.

1:03:52.912 --> 1:03:54.539
What he sees, what he feels

1:03:54.622 --> 1:03:56.332
of this vast, unknown universe

1:03:56.499 --> 1:03:58.417
is beyond anything
our simple brains can...

1:03:58.501 --> 1:03:59.919
-Oh. You can go.

1:04:00.336 --> 1:04:01.379
What?

1:04:01.462 --> 1:04:03.256
Go. You can go. He says "go."

1:04:26.487 --> 1:04:27.947
You should speed up.

1:04:28.614 --> 1:04:29.615
What? Why?

1:04:31.826 --> 1:04:32.994
Katy, go, go, go!

1:04:36.998 --> 1:04:38.082
-Morris says,

1:04:38.165 --> 1:04:40.042
-"Hard right on three."
-What?

1:04:40.209 --> 1:04:41.210
TREVOR: Two...

1:04:41.294 --> 1:04:42.295
SHANG-CHI: Hard right where?

1:04:42.378 --> 1:04:43.754
-Now.
-

1:04:51.012 --> 1:04:52.305
-And left.

1:04:52.388 --> 1:04:53.931
-

1:04:56.726 --> 1:04:58.311
It's all about staying
in the pocket.

1:04:58.477 --> 1:05:00.146
-What pocket?
-We're in it now.

1:05:00.313 --> 1:05:01.981
SHANG-CHI: What happens if
we don't stay in the pocket?

1:05:02.148 --> 1:05:03.149
The forest eats us.

1:05:03.316 --> 1:05:04.775
Eats us? What does that mean?

1:05:04.942 --> 1:05:06.485
He says it eats us.
Go left.

1:05:14.702 --> 1:05:16.746
-SHANG-CHI: Watch your back!
-Stay in the pocket.

1:05:16.913 --> 1:05:18.497
-KATY: How close is it?
-Five meters.

1:05:18.664 --> 1:05:20.416
-TREVOR: Stay in the pocket.
-What is that in feet?

1:05:20.583 --> 1:05:21.584
Really fricking close.

1:05:21.751 --> 1:05:22.752
Stay in the pocket.

1:05:22.919 --> 1:05:24.462
Will you just stop saying,
"Stay in the pocket"?

1:05:31.052 --> 1:05:33.179
One last right,
then straight on to the end.

1:05:41.228 --> 1:05:42.563
You might wanna hurry up.

1:05:42.730 --> 1:05:44.565
What do you think I'm doing?

1:05:46.192 --> 1:05:47.234
We're not gonna make it.

1:05:50.404 --> 1:05:51.989
I'm coming home, Mummy.

1:06:04.293 --> 1:06:07.254
Morris says,
"Great job, everyone."

1:06:08.673 --> 1:06:11.550
Now, all we have to do
is go through that waterfall,

1:06:11.717 --> 1:06:13.511
and we're pretty much there.

1:07:03.853 --> 1:07:04.895
TREVOR: Bloody hell.

1:07:05.062 --> 1:07:06.814
I think those birds
are on fire.

1:07:06.897 --> 1:07:09.275
-Really? Oh.

1:07:09.567 --> 1:07:11.777
Morris says it's normal.

1:07:11.944 --> 1:07:14.280
They're old mates of his.

1:07:41.557 --> 1:07:42.975
-

1:07:48.189 --> 1:07:50.191
That's a weird horse.

1:07:51.609 --> 1:07:53.360
What's it looking at me for?

1:08:56.882 --> 1:08:59.009
Hi there!

1:08:59.260 --> 1:09:01.178
I am Xu Shang-Chi.

1:09:01.804 --> 1:09:04.598
This is my sister, Xu Xialing.

1:09:04.765 --> 1:09:07.309
We're Ying Li's children.

1:09:11.188 --> 1:09:12.690
This is my friend, Katy.

1:09:12.857 --> 1:09:16.485
Get in your car and go home!

1:09:16.652 --> 1:09:19.155
Please. You don't understand.

1:09:24.243 --> 1:09:25.494
-Whoa.
-

1:09:25.578 --> 1:09:26.996
Guang Bo!

1:09:28.372 --> 1:09:30.541
What are you doing?

1:09:31.167 --> 1:09:33.335
Put down your weapons!

1:09:36.297 --> 1:09:37.965
Shang-Chi.

1:09:38.424 --> 1:09:39.550
Xialing.

1:09:39.717 --> 1:09:42.970
I'm your auntie, Nan.

1:09:44.722 --> 1:09:47.433
I've waited so long to meet you.

1:09:57.109 --> 1:09:58.736
You look like your mother.

1:10:06.577 --> 1:10:07.703
Hi, I'm Katy.

1:10:07.912 --> 1:10:09.288
YING NAN:
Welcome to Ta Lo, Katy.

1:10:09.371 --> 1:10:10.956
Oh, thank you.

1:10:16.754 --> 1:10:19.256
YING NAN: Look who has found
his way home!

1:10:19.924 --> 1:10:21.175
I'm not a threat.

1:10:21.342 --> 1:10:23.469
Just an entertainer.

1:10:23.636 --> 1:10:25.221
Morris can vouch for me.

1:10:27.181 --> 1:10:28.557
We don't have much time.

1:10:29.016 --> 1:10:30.351
Our father is coming.

1:10:38.442 --> 1:10:41.403
YING NAN: Our people have been
here for over 4,000 years,

1:10:41.570 --> 1:10:44.365
preparing for something
we hope will never happen.

1:10:44.531 --> 1:10:47.076
We are the keepers
of the Dark Gate,

1:10:47.243 --> 1:10:49.620
sworn to protect this realm
and yours

1:10:49.703 --> 1:10:52.289
from the evil
that's locked behind it.

1:10:53.123 --> 1:10:55.334
SHANG-CHI: Our dad is coming
here to open that gate.

1:10:55.876 --> 1:10:57.878
He thinks
you're holding our mom there.

1:10:59.171 --> 1:11:00.673
Why would he think that?

1:11:00.839 --> 1:11:02.049
XIALING: She told him.

1:11:02.216 --> 1:11:04.260
He says he can hear her
asking for help.

1:11:06.679 --> 1:11:08.681
Is he wearing the rings?

1:11:08.847 --> 1:11:10.975
SHANG-CHI: He hasn't
taken them off since she died.

1:11:12.893 --> 1:11:14.520
What do they have to do
with all this?

1:11:18.440 --> 1:11:20.526
YING NAN: The realm of Ta Lo
stretches far beyond

1:11:20.609 --> 1:11:22.486
the shores
of our small village.

1:11:22.653 --> 1:11:26.323
We have cities that surpass
any in your universe,

1:11:26.490 --> 1:11:29.201
rich with culture and history.

1:11:29.368 --> 1:11:31.370
Thousands of years ago,

1:11:31.537 --> 1:11:34.790
all of our people
lived in peace and prosperity,

1:11:35.874 --> 1:11:39.003
until the attack
of the Dweller-in-Darkness.

1:11:39.628 --> 1:11:41.046
He came with his army,

1:11:41.130 --> 1:11:44.174
devouring every soul
in their path,

1:11:44.341 --> 1:11:48.012
and with each kill,
they grew stronger.

1:11:48.679 --> 1:11:51.223
After decimating
our largest cities,

1:11:51.390 --> 1:11:54.810
they were headed to
your universe to do the same.

1:11:54.977 --> 1:11:58.355
The leaders of Ta Lo sent
their strongest warriors here

1:11:58.522 --> 1:12:01.734
to stop them from reaching
the portal to your world.

1:12:02.318 --> 1:12:05.446
But our ancestors
were no match for them.

1:12:06.572 --> 1:12:09.575
Until The Great Protector

1:12:09.700 --> 1:12:13.245
joined their fight
and turned the tide.

1:12:13.954 --> 1:12:16.957
Together, they pushed
the Dweller and his army

1:12:17.041 --> 1:12:18.250
into the Dark Gate

1:12:18.417 --> 1:12:20.878
and locked it behind them.

1:12:22.838 --> 1:12:26.258
Our people have guarded
that gate ever since,

1:12:26.425 --> 1:12:29.887
empowered by the magic
of The Great Protector

1:12:30.054 --> 1:12:32.348
and the gift that she gave us.

1:12:43.984 --> 1:12:44.985
Dragon scales.

1:12:45.152 --> 1:12:46.820
Makes very good armor.

1:12:48.947 --> 1:12:50.991
Your father isn't the first
to come here

1:12:51.075 --> 1:12:52.326
to open the Dark Gate.

1:12:52.910 --> 1:12:55.162
Many have tried and failed
over the centuries,

1:12:55.329 --> 1:12:57.664
and they all had one thing
in common.

1:12:57.831 --> 1:12:58.832
They were lured here

1:12:58.916 --> 1:13:01.043
by the voice of something
on the other side.

1:13:01.835 --> 1:13:04.713
A voice that promised them
their greatest desires.

1:13:07.174 --> 1:13:11.345
So you think soul eaters
are talking to our dad?

1:13:12.137 --> 1:13:15.474
They know The Ten Rings have
the power to break them free.

1:13:19.812 --> 1:13:20.813
Oh.

1:13:23.440 --> 1:13:25.025
Here you go.

1:13:25.275 --> 1:13:26.276
Oh.

1:13:26.819 --> 1:13:28.278
To the range.

1:13:29.446 --> 1:13:31.490
What? Okay.

1:13:32.241 --> 1:13:34.910
Um, looks like I'm gonna go
deliver some dragon arrows.

1:13:35.119 --> 1:13:36.537
Oh, you're gonna deliver
some dragon arrows?

1:13:36.620 --> 1:13:37.913
KATY: Yeah.
Make myself useful, you know.

1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:39.081
Thank you.

1:13:41.125 --> 1:13:42.835
Let's go see your mother.

1:13:47.256 --> 1:13:48.757
-

1:13:57.516 --> 1:14:00.102
I just love how you guys know
exactly what you wanna do,

1:14:00.310 --> 1:14:03.105
and you spend your whole life
getting really good at it.

1:14:03.272 --> 1:14:04.857
I wish I was more like that.

1:14:05.023 --> 1:14:07.109
It's like every time I get
moderately good at something,

1:14:07.276 --> 1:14:09.528
I just quit
and start something new.

1:14:09.695 --> 1:14:11.613
But I just know my own limits,

1:14:11.780 --> 1:14:14.408
and I'm not gonna waste
my time chasing something

1:14:14.491 --> 1:14:16.326
that will ultimately be
a disappointment for me.

1:14:16.410 --> 1:14:17.453
-That's not me.
-

1:14:17.536 --> 1:14:18.996
Guang Bo.

1:14:20.247 --> 1:14:21.582
Let her shoot.

1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:28.630
If you aim at nothing,
you hit nothing.

1:14:52.112 --> 1:14:53.739
You were everything to her.

1:14:55.407 --> 1:14:57.868
She knew that one day
you would find your way here

1:14:58.035 --> 1:15:00.787
and asked me to prepare
something for your arrival.

1:15:23.352 --> 1:15:25.270
After losing someone like her,

1:15:25.354 --> 1:15:27.981
it's easy to feel alone
in this world.

1:15:28.649 --> 1:15:30.317
But you're not.

1:15:30.484 --> 1:15:32.736
You are children
of this family,

1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:35.656
and I welcome you home.

1:16:03.308 --> 1:16:05.143
You're not in your
father's house anymore.

1:16:06.895 --> 1:16:11.024
In Ta Lo, we train as equals.

1:16:12.776 --> 1:16:16.655
You've been in the shadows
long enough, my child.

1:16:36.049 --> 1:16:37.259
Guang Bo, you saw that?

1:16:38.010 --> 1:16:39.344
That was tight!

1:16:52.733 --> 1:16:54.651
My mother was the only one
who could beat him.

1:16:56.236 --> 1:16:58.030
Show me how she did it.

1:17:05.287 --> 1:17:06.788
No, sorry.

1:17:06.955 --> 1:17:08.540
Sorry. Offside, offside.

1:18:09.267 --> 1:18:11.478
YING NAN: Your mother knew
who she was.

1:18:12.229 --> 1:18:13.397
Do you?

1:18:35.127 --> 1:18:36.670
-

1:19:19.421 --> 1:19:22.466
You are a product
of all who came before you.

1:19:23.425 --> 1:19:27.262
The legacy of your family,
the good and the bad,

1:19:28.054 --> 1:19:30.390
it is all a part
of who you are.

1:19:34.770 --> 1:19:36.855
Stop hiding, nephew.

1:19:37.689 --> 1:19:39.733
It only prolongs the pain.

1:20:12.182 --> 1:20:14.726
We'll be together soon.

1:20:21.149 --> 1:20:22.150
Sir.

1:20:24.820 --> 1:20:26.321
The men are ready.

1:20:27.364 --> 1:20:29.157
The passage will open at dawn.

1:20:30.116 --> 1:20:31.743
RAZOR FIST:
I'll prepare the vehicles.

1:20:55.892 --> 1:20:57.853
Lead with your breath.

1:20:58.311 --> 1:21:01.273
Look into your heart,

1:21:01.439 --> 1:21:04.776
the light and the dark.

1:21:04.943 --> 1:21:09.030
To know yourself,

1:21:09.197 --> 1:21:13.118
you must face them both.

1:21:28.216 --> 1:21:30.135
Your husband tried to destroy us.

1:21:30.719 --> 1:21:33.388
The Iron Gang is here
to repay that debt.

1:21:34.014 --> 1:21:35.932
My husband is not the man
he used to be.

1:21:36.725 --> 1:21:38.101
It doesn't matter.

1:21:39.352 --> 1:21:42.606
Your business with him has nothing
to do with my children.

1:21:45.525 --> 1:21:47.402
They can go,

1:21:47.569 --> 1:21:51.364
but someone has to pay.

1:21:56.036 --> 1:21:57.871
Xialing. Shang-Chi.

1:21:58.038 --> 1:21:59.039
Go inside.

1:21:59.164 --> 1:22:01.958
I'm going to talk to our guests.

1:22:07.964 --> 1:22:10.800
But you don't have your powers.

1:22:13.511 --> 1:22:15.555
Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear.

1:23:15.073 --> 1:23:17.409
-

1:23:37.804 --> 1:23:39.014
YOUNG SHANG-CHI: Mama.

1:23:41.641 --> 1:23:42.809
Mama.

1:24:01.327 --> 1:24:02.537
Papa.

1:24:11.838 --> 1:24:14.883
She told me I could change.

1:24:16.384 --> 1:24:19.637
That I could leave my past behind.

1:24:22.057 --> 1:24:24.559
But she was wrong.

1:24:27.771 --> 1:24:30.398
If I hadn't taken them off,

1:24:31.316 --> 1:24:35.278
those men wouldn't have
dared to do this.

1:24:37.739 --> 1:24:40.492
And now they will pay for it.

1:24:40.575 --> 1:24:43.411
-

1:25:11.272 --> 1:25:13.191
-

1:25:16.194 --> 1:25:17.821
-

1:25:34.921 --> 1:25:35.964
Where's your boss?

1:25:36.422 --> 1:25:37.423
I don't know!

1:25:37.841 --> 1:25:39.425
I swear I don't!

1:25:41.010 --> 1:25:42.595
Okay.

1:25:44.055 --> 1:25:45.306
-

1:25:55.942 --> 1:26:00.697
A blood debt has to be
paid by blood.

1:26:01.531 --> 1:26:03.324
Will you help me?

1:26:33.271 --> 1:26:34.480
We found the man

1:26:34.564 --> 1:26:36.649
responsible for killing
your mother.

1:26:37.859 --> 1:26:40.945
It is your right
to finish this for both of us.

1:26:42.071 --> 1:26:43.698
And when you return,

1:26:43.865 --> 1:26:47.368
we will rebuild The Ten Rings
to what it once was.

1:27:08.890 --> 1:27:10.516
Been looking
everywhere for ya.

1:27:18.441 --> 1:27:19.651
You okay?

1:27:24.030 --> 1:27:27.408
I'm not who you think I am.

1:27:27.575 --> 1:27:29.410
You already apologized
for that. We're good...

1:27:29.577 --> 1:27:31.537
That's not what
I'm talking about.

1:27:33.831 --> 1:27:35.041
Okay.

1:27:36.626 --> 1:27:38.419
What... What is it?

1:27:44.008 --> 1:27:48.846
When my dad sent me to find
the man who killed my mom...

1:27:51.557 --> 1:27:53.768
I told you
I couldn't go through with it.

1:27:58.815 --> 1:28:00.316
I lied.

1:28:04.570 --> 1:28:06.864
I thought that
I could change my name,

1:28:07.031 --> 1:28:09.951
start a new life, pretend like
it never happened.

1:28:10.118 --> 1:28:11.327
But...

1:28:18.251 --> 1:28:20.503
She would hate
the person I've become.

1:28:27.218 --> 1:28:29.429
Your dad trained you
to be an assassin

1:28:29.512 --> 1:28:31.431
when you were seven.

1:28:32.181 --> 1:28:35.768
He sent you on a hit at 14.

1:28:37.729 --> 1:28:40.106
You realize how messed up
that is, right?

1:28:43.735 --> 1:28:46.237
My mom is dead because of him.

1:28:49.198 --> 1:28:51.951
And now he's coming
to destroy her home.

1:29:01.336 --> 1:29:04.589
A blood debt has to be
paid by blood.

1:29:07.508 --> 1:29:09.260
What are you saying?

1:29:12.805 --> 1:29:15.016
I'm gonna do
what he trained me to do.

1:29:21.022 --> 1:29:22.565
I'm gonna kill him.

1:30:00.228 --> 1:30:01.854
-

1:30:10.029 --> 1:30:11.030
He's here.

1:30:23.376 --> 1:30:24.377
No!

1:30:24.460 --> 1:30:25.711
You're not ready.

1:30:25.878 --> 1:30:27.922
She stays here.

1:31:21.642 --> 1:31:23.227
Are you here
to help the people

1:31:23.311 --> 1:31:25.771
holding your own mother
captive?

1:31:26.189 --> 1:31:27.773
YING NAN:
She isn't back there.

1:31:28.149 --> 1:31:29.150
You're being lied to

1:31:29.233 --> 1:31:31.402
by a creature
who wants to destroy us all.

1:31:32.862 --> 1:31:34.947
Is that what they told you?

1:31:35.531 --> 1:31:38.159
I know my wife's voice.

1:31:38.367 --> 1:31:40.912
I miss my sister
as much as you do,

1:31:41.078 --> 1:31:43.664
but this is not the way
to honor her memory.

1:31:43.831 --> 1:31:45.625
Did you honor her
when you turned her away

1:31:45.708 --> 1:31:46.709
from your gate?

1:31:46.834 --> 1:31:49.337
You fool. We turned you away.

1:31:49.504 --> 1:31:52.048
The sins of your past would have
destroyed this place.

1:31:52.381 --> 1:31:56.677
Be careful how you speak to me,
young man.

1:31:57.094 --> 1:32:00.890
I've lived ten of your lifetimes.

1:32:02.433 --> 1:32:04.060
Let me pass.

1:32:04.393 --> 1:32:06.437
We cannot do that.

1:32:25.414 --> 1:32:26.582
Burn it down.

1:32:33.381 --> 1:32:35.716
-

1:32:48.271 --> 1:32:50.273
-

1:33:30.521 --> 1:33:31.647
Stop him!

1:34:07.266 --> 1:34:10.269
Are you planning to stop me
all by yourself?

1:34:14.607 --> 1:34:16.025
I'm not afraid of you.

1:34:23.324 --> 1:34:24.533
Yes, you are.

1:34:30.164 --> 1:34:33.584
You've spent
your entire life afraid.

1:34:33.751 --> 1:34:35.795
Always running,

1:34:35.961 --> 1:34:37.254
always hiding.

1:34:52.478 --> 1:34:54.647
You were there
when they came for her,

1:34:54.814 --> 1:34:56.982
and you did nothing.

1:34:57.566 --> 1:35:00.444
You stood at a window
and watched her die!

1:35:35.271 --> 1:35:36.981
She was gone
and we needed you.

1:35:38.190 --> 1:35:41.402
But you chose those damn rings
over us.

1:35:45.489 --> 1:35:46.991
You trained your son
to be a killer.

1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:49.326
Is this what you wanted?

1:36:06.719 --> 1:36:08.387
Even if you could
bring her back,

1:36:10.181 --> 1:36:12.808
what makes you think she'd
want anything to do with you?

1:36:38.417 --> 1:36:40.127
Save me.

1:36:41.128 --> 1:36:43.464
Save me, my dear.

1:37:03.275 --> 1:37:05.152
Save me.

1:37:05.611 --> 1:37:08.030
I'm coming, my love.

1:37:32.680 --> 1:37:34.306
-

1:37:49.613 --> 1:37:50.823
He breached the gate!

1:37:55.286 --> 1:37:56.495
Those things
are gonna kill us all

1:37:56.579 --> 1:37:58.163
if we don't work together.

1:37:58.330 --> 1:38:00.374
You think
I'm going to fall for that?

1:38:00.541 --> 1:38:02.710
Your weapons are useless
against them.

1:38:03.168 --> 1:38:04.795
We don't need your help.

1:38:05.337 --> 1:38:07.590
We are the mighty Ten Rings,

1:38:07.673 --> 1:38:09.091
-and any...
-

1:38:17.182 --> 1:38:19.184
-

1:38:33.782 --> 1:38:36.368
We... We should work together.

1:38:36.535 --> 1:38:38.579
Release them.

1:38:38.746 --> 1:38:40.497
Release them!

1:38:46.253 --> 1:38:47.546
XIALING: What are they doing?

1:38:47.713 --> 1:38:50.174
YING NAN: Stealing souls to
feed the Dweller-in-Darkness.

1:38:50.299 --> 1:38:51.675
If it grows strong enough,

1:38:51.759 --> 1:38:53.177
it will break
right through the gate.

1:38:53.344 --> 1:38:55.304
That was just the beginning.

1:38:58.223 --> 1:38:59.516
It's too dangerous.

1:38:59.683 --> 1:39:00.935
I have to help my friends.

1:39:05.230 --> 1:39:07.232
Don't die.

1:39:08.317 --> 1:39:11.070
Everyone to the water now!

1:39:11.153 --> 1:39:12.363
To the lake! Let's go!

1:39:12.446 --> 1:39:13.656
Let's go!

1:39:15.783 --> 1:39:17.826
Hey, where's your brother?

1:39:17.993 --> 1:39:19.703
I was hoping you knew.

1:39:27.586 --> 1:39:28.587
Save me.

1:39:30.965 --> 1:39:33.217
-

1:39:53.153 --> 1:39:56.073
Aim at the sky,
to win or die!

1:40:09.837 --> 1:40:11.588
Deep breath.

1:40:27.271 --> 1:40:29.732
Shang-Chi, you have nothing to fear.

1:40:30.899 --> 1:40:33.068
You have the heart
of our dragon.

1:40:33.861 --> 1:40:37.197
I will always be a part of you.
And your dad will too.

1:40:37.823 --> 1:40:41.952
Take everything we've given you
and make it your own.

1:40:59.219 --> 1:41:01.472
I'm so proud of you.

1:41:05.809 --> 1:41:08.228
Our family needs you.

1:41:09.646 --> 1:41:10.647
Go.

1:42:04.785 --> 1:42:06.537
Draw.

1:42:10.499 --> 1:42:11.834
Fire!

1:42:39.236 --> 1:42:41.155
You have to stop your father!

1:43:12.269 --> 1:43:14.396
She's not back there, Dad.

1:43:15.856 --> 1:43:19.693
Get out of my way, boy.

1:43:20.944 --> 1:43:21.945
No.

1:43:56.104 --> 1:43:58.232
-

1:44:03.111 --> 1:44:04.863
-

1:44:25.759 --> 1:44:27.010
Calm down, mate.

1:44:27.177 --> 1:44:28.637
I'm not dead,
it's just a performance.

1:44:28.804 --> 1:44:30.430
Now get down here
and play along.
