00:54.916 --> 00:56.500
Good morning, Omega.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.041
Come along.

01:01.041 --> 01:02.541
There is much to do today.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.166
Something's different.

01:47.791 --> 01:49.625
Why are there so many troopers around?

01:50.166 --> 01:51.333
I'm not certain.

01:51.333 --> 01:52.750
You don't know?

01:52.750 --> 01:55.916
The doctor will inform me
if it's necessary.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.166
Emerie, a word?

02:11.958 --> 02:14.333
An unexpected guest is arriving shortly.

02:15.291 --> 02:17.791
Nala Se and I will be indisposed
until he departs.

02:18.541 --> 02:20.541
Oversee the lab in her absence.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.208
As you wish, Doctor.

02:22.833 --> 02:24.666
I will begin testing the latest samples.

02:25.250 --> 02:27.250
That is unnecessary.

02:27.833 --> 02:30.666
I will see to them when I return.

02:30.666 --> 02:33.333
Dr. Karr's quite capable
of handling such matters.

02:33.333 --> 02:34.958
- See it done.
- Sir.

02:36.125 --> 02:38.375
- Is everything in order?
- Affirmative.

02:39.000 --> 02:42.916
The shuttle has left the orbital station
and the coordinates were transmitted.

02:42.916 --> 02:46.583
Have additional V-wings standing
by to escort his vessel to the base.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.833
Yes, sir.

02:48.708 --> 02:50.416
- Omega...
- All patrols are posted

02:50.416 --> 02:52.583
- and standing by for additional orders.
- ...listen carefully.

02:53.125 --> 02:58.625
If Emerie tests your sample,
you will be in danger.

03:00.041 --> 03:05.875
You must flee this facility
before it is too late.

03:05.875 --> 03:07.083
- Wait.
- See to it...

03:07.083 --> 03:09.583
Is that why you've been
destroying my samples?

03:09.583 --> 03:11.125
- Yes.
- Yes, sir.

03:11.125 --> 03:13.958
- Project--
- Nala Se, come along.

03:13.958 --> 03:15.666
Our guest is arriving.

03:15.666 --> 03:22.416
Go to the lab,
retrieve my datapad and use it to escape.

03:23.583 --> 03:26.875
Sneak aboard a shuttle and flee.

03:26.875 --> 03:27.958
Nala Se.

03:29.750 --> 03:31.333
You must go.

04:38.583 --> 04:40.916
Did you need something, Omega?

04:40.916 --> 04:42.083
I...

04:43.000 --> 04:46.166
Hemlock said there's a guest arriving.

04:46.166 --> 04:48.000
Who is it?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.750
It's best not to ask questions.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.166
See to your tasks for the day.

05:00.750 --> 05:01.833
Are you feeling well?

05:04.291 --> 05:07.125
Forget your assignments and get some rest.

05:08.500 --> 05:09.500
Okay.

05:13.916 --> 05:17.125
Omega, I can handle things here.

05:17.125 --> 05:19.791
Go. I'll check on you later.

06:21.166 --> 06:24.750
Emperor, your presence is an honor.

06:26.166 --> 06:31.791
I have been most eager to see
the progress you have made, Doctor.

06:46.666 --> 06:50.166
We have quadrupled our objectives
in record time.

06:51.291 --> 06:53.791
The exotic matter facilities
have expanded,

06:53.791 --> 06:58.125
providing alteration and testing
of much larger assets.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.750
I have need of such grand designs.

07:02.750 --> 07:08.583
However, that is not the reason
why I am here today.

07:09.166 --> 07:10.291
Of course.

07:10.875 --> 07:12.333
Project Necromancer.

08:18.250 --> 08:19.250
Crosshair.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.791
What are you doing here?

08:22.791 --> 08:24.250
Escaping.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.583
And you're coming with me.

08:33.125 --> 08:34.458
You found a weak point?

08:34.458 --> 08:36.208
Not exactly.

08:36.208 --> 08:37.625
I'm kinda improvising.

08:37.625 --> 08:40.375
Is that some kind of joke?

08:40.375 --> 08:41.625
I'll explain later.

08:41.625 --> 08:43.625
Just get the guards' attention.

08:43.625 --> 08:45.375
That's not a plan.

08:45.375 --> 08:47.625
Just distract them.

08:56.541 --> 08:57.541
Guards!

09:06.333 --> 09:08.916
Unlock this cell.

09:08.916 --> 09:10.541
What did you say?

09:10.541 --> 09:12.958
I was giving you an order.

09:12.958 --> 09:16.750
This clone thinks he outranks us.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.250
I do.

09:19.250 --> 09:21.791
And I'll take your blaster too.

09:21.791 --> 09:22.958
Oh, yeah?

09:22.958 --> 09:24.791
How are you gonna do that?

09:24.791 --> 09:26.541
You'll see.

09:39.166 --> 09:41.458
- Nice work.
- Didn't have much choice.

09:41.458 --> 09:43.250
You're out of the cell, aren't you?

10:03.541 --> 10:05.875
Well? Start talking.

10:05.875 --> 10:08.708
I told you. We're escaping.

10:08.708 --> 10:09.791
Why now?

10:09.791 --> 10:11.125
What's changed?

10:11.625 --> 10:13.291
Nala Se said I had to.

10:13.875 --> 10:15.666
And I wasn't gonna leave without you.

10:16.416 --> 10:20.583
She told me to use her datapad
to access the base and find a shuttle.

10:21.541 --> 10:23.208
We just need to get to a hangar.

10:31.666 --> 10:34.875
We're not supposed
to be on patrol until midwatch.

10:34.875 --> 10:36.416
Commander's orders.

10:36.416 --> 10:38.833
All hands on deck
until the Emperor departs.

10:40.375 --> 10:42.375
The Emperor's here?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.791
What? I didn't know.

10:45.416 --> 10:49.375
Another reason why this
was not the day to wing an escape.

10:49.375 --> 10:52.708
Thanks for the reminder,
but I think we're past that point.

10:54.875 --> 10:57.041
Your hand's getting worse, isn't it?

10:58.333 --> 10:59.833
I-It's fine.

11:04.833 --> 11:05.916
Uh-oh.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.375
What?

11:07.375 --> 11:10.791
All shuttles have been grounded,
except the Emperor's.

11:11.416 --> 11:12.625
We'll have to steal it.

11:12.625 --> 11:13.958
Impossible.

11:13.958 --> 11:16.625
It will be too well-guarded, even for me.

11:17.708 --> 11:18.750
Wait.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.250
I know a shuttle we can use.

11:20.250 --> 11:23.666
It crash-landed outside the perimeter
back when I first came here.

11:23.666 --> 11:26.708
How does a crashed shuttle help us?

11:26.708 --> 11:31.166
If the comms are still functioning,
we can contact Hunter and Wrecker.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.916
And how do we get outside?

11:32.916 --> 11:34.000
Follow me.

11:49.958 --> 11:51.291
As you can see,

11:51.291 --> 11:56.458
the specimens are well-guarded
to ensure they remain viable for testing.

11:57.416 --> 12:01.083
However, with more time,
and additional resources,

12:01.708 --> 12:06.583
I am confident that we will have
a successful M-count replication.

12:07.833 --> 12:13.333
There is nothing of greater importance
to secure the future of this Empire.

12:14.625 --> 12:19.791
Whatever is needed to accomplish
this goal, you will have it.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.791
Now what?

13:07.791 --> 13:09.333
We'll use the kennel chute.

13:09.333 --> 13:12.333
It leads outside,
but it's protected by a timed ray shield.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.458
We'll have to move fast
or we'll be trapped.

13:15.541 --> 13:17.166
Oh, I can hardly wait.

13:17.166 --> 13:19.375
We can use Batcher's empty kennel.

13:19.375 --> 13:20.458
Be ready.

13:21.541 --> 13:22.750
Omega.

13:22.750 --> 13:24.125
Don't!

13:24.125 --> 13:26.125
You should go back to your room.

13:26.125 --> 13:27.958
You mean her cell.

13:27.958 --> 13:30.291
You're not thinking clearly.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.708
Neither of you.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.416
But it's not too late.

13:33.416 --> 13:36.166
Come with me
and no one needs to know about this.

13:36.166 --> 13:38.166
I can't do that.

13:38.166 --> 13:39.208
Omega.

13:39.208 --> 13:42.791
I spent most of my life
confined on Kamino.

13:43.875 --> 13:45.541
I won't be trapped here too.

13:47.250 --> 13:49.583
You're a clone like us, Emerie.

13:50.916 --> 13:52.250
Help us.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.000
Escape is not possible, Omega.

13:57.416 --> 13:59.083
This is for your own good.

14:03.333 --> 14:04.750
We have to go.

14:15.083 --> 14:20.625
It is imperative that this facility
remain hidden and secure.

14:21.291 --> 14:24.541
There are many, even within our own ranks,

14:24.541 --> 14:28.625
who would consider much of your work
an abomination.

14:29.875 --> 14:33.708
But they lack the vision that we possess.

14:36.541 --> 14:40.541
Your brilliance is a great asset
to this Empire.

14:41.291 --> 14:44.458
If I am appointed the scientific minister,

14:45.416 --> 14:47.833
I would strive to bring unleashed glory

14:47.833 --> 14:50.916
to all divisions
of the Imperial science corps.

14:54.375 --> 14:56.250
All in due time.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.458
Yes, Emperor.

15:09.916 --> 15:11.541
- Sir.
- What is it?

15:11.541 --> 15:14.208
Omega and prisoner CT-9904 are missing.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.500
Missing?

15:15.500 --> 15:17.708
An alarm was just triggered
in the lurca kennels.

15:18.791 --> 15:19.958
Seal it off.

15:21.791 --> 15:22.958
Activate the ray shields.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.958
The shield's not supposed to activate yet.

15:32.958 --> 15:34.625
They know we're in here.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.125
Move faster!

15:47.333 --> 15:50.250
- What direction is the crashed shuttle?
- Not sure.

15:50.916 --> 15:53.166
Oh, great.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.833
We'll follow the flight path.

16:07.916 --> 16:09.125
What happened?

16:12.416 --> 16:14.083
Omega had one of our datapads.

16:14.666 --> 16:16.500
They used it to access the chute.

16:19.166 --> 16:21.625
They made it past the ray shields.

16:21.625 --> 16:24.625
Dispatch patrols and release the lurcas.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.625
Doctor,
the lurcas will not bring them back alive.

16:44.625 --> 16:46.708
They are prisoners who have escaped.

16:47.375 --> 16:49.833
The time for half measures is over.

16:49.833 --> 16:52.916
- Perhaps I could--
- Return to the lab, Dr. Karr.

16:57.833 --> 17:03.833
I'm curious how your assistant
managed to escape this facility.

17:04.916 --> 17:07.000
One must assume she had help.

17:08.291 --> 17:10.916
I have been right by your side.

17:11.541 --> 17:12.875
Secure her in a cell.

17:15.583 --> 17:17.250
Scramble the recovery team.

17:17.250 --> 17:18.333
Yes, sir.

17:39.833 --> 17:41.375
I'm picking up something.

17:41.375 --> 17:42.875
I think it could be the ship.

17:43.708 --> 17:45.125
That way.

17:48.916 --> 17:50.541
Oh, good.

17:50.541 --> 17:52.208
The killer hounds.

18:00.083 --> 18:01.416
It should be up ahead.

18:10.375 --> 18:11.458
Thanks.

18:16.250 --> 18:17.750
Crosshair.

18:41.250 --> 18:42.250
Go!

19:22.125 --> 19:24.041
Anything?

19:24.666 --> 19:27.083
It's not working!

19:27.583 --> 19:29.708
Comms are completely dead.

19:38.541 --> 19:39.541
They're coming.

19:46.416 --> 19:48.916
We're getting an odd energy surge
in sector 4.

19:48.916 --> 19:50.208
It has to be them.

19:50.208 --> 19:51.541
I'm sorry.

19:51.541 --> 19:53.333
I thought this would work.

19:53.333 --> 19:55.500
You got us this far.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.958
And we're not done yet.

19:59.375 --> 20:01.708
Did they teach you plan 72?

20:01.708 --> 20:04.583
Mm-hmm.
Tech had me memorize all the plans.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.083
Of course he did.

20:19.916 --> 20:21.583
Hook in and stay alert.

20:22.083 --> 20:23.791
We need those prisoners found.

20:52.208 --> 20:53.541
We've engaged the prisoners.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.333
Stand down.

21:01.333 --> 21:02.416
Hello.

21:02.416 --> 21:04.875
I said, "Stand down."

21:09.791 --> 21:10.958
Batcher?

21:12.250 --> 21:14.583
Stay close.

21:55.875 --> 21:57.791
Take cover! Look out!

22:09.083 --> 22:10.875
The prisoners hijacked our shuttle!

22:27.958 --> 22:29.583
Batcher, come!

23:17.208 --> 23:19.250
They're locking onto us! I--

23:19.250 --> 23:20.875
I can't shake them!

23:20.875 --> 23:22.125
Systems are failing!

23:22.125 --> 23:24.666
I want that ship neutralized.

23:25.208 --> 23:26.208
Stop!

23:26.208 --> 23:28.125
- Don't shoot them down.
- What?

23:28.125 --> 23:30.958
The clone's sample supported
a positive M-count transfer

23:30.958 --> 23:33.208
with no degradation from the specimen.

23:33.208 --> 23:37.666
CT-9904 was ruled out long ago.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.708
Not him. It's Omega.

23:44.208 --> 23:45.208
Call them off!

23:45.208 --> 23:47.083
But, sir, they're escaping.

23:47.083 --> 23:48.416
Stand down!

23:49.333 --> 23:51.833
We need her alive.

23:57.416 --> 23:58.750
Now!

24:02.291 --> 24:03.708
They've jumped.

24:07.583 --> 24:09.250
A minor setback.

24:10.916 --> 24:14.500
I have the full resources of the Empire
at my disposal.

24:15.916 --> 24:17.250
We will find her.
