20:00.758 --> 20:02.258
Well, I say, trap-door them all

20:02.260 --> 20:04.593
and let the FAA sort it out.

20:04.595 --> 20:05.761
Excellent.

20:05.763 --> 20:07.705
-So ordered.
-Wait.

20:07.856 --> 20:11.116
As the one person who was
not trap-doored on this flight,

20:11.235 --> 20:13.544
I believe I have
the authority to say

20:13.546 --> 20:18.290
that mass in-flight
incarceration is not the answer.

20:18.367 --> 20:20.534
We need thoughtful solutions

20:20.536 --> 20:23.870
to this epidemic of rudeness
and disrespect.

20:23.948 --> 20:25.556
Sure, it's easy to push a button

20:25.633 --> 20:28.375
and drop all your problems
down a trap...

20:28.377 --> 20:30.728
door...!

20:30.805 --> 20:32.638
-[thuds]
-Ow!

20:32.715 --> 20:35.233
Honey, are you hurt?

20:35.309 --> 20:38.385
[Marge echoing]
I'm okay. I landed on my hair.
