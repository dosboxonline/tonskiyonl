WEBVTT

00:57.933 --> 00:59.059
Do you have them?

01:16.118 --> 01:17.119
Thank you.

03:58.864 --> 03:59.864
- Hey.
- <i>Hey.</i>

03:59.865 --> 04:01.158
<i>How was the weekend thing?</i>

04:01.742 --> 04:03.034
Good, I guess.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.953
Although my innie fell off a rope, apparently.

04:05.954 --> 04:07.039
<i>A rope?</i>

04:07.706 --> 04:09.040
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

04:09.041 --> 04:11.375
No, I just got a little wet, that's all.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.586
<i>Jesus, it's like it never ends
with these guys.</i>

04:13.587 --> 04:15.546
<i>Do you know what the fuck
actually happened?</i>

04:15.547 --> 04:16.798
I have no idea.

04:17.966 --> 04:23.472
<i>Fuck. Well, how's the old "burning
shit into your eyeballs" thing going?</i>

04:25.390 --> 04:28.476
I still can't get it to last long enough.

04:28.477 --> 04:30.896
<i>Okay. So, what do we do?</i>

04:31.980 --> 04:34.482
Just keep trying, I guess.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.026
<i>Do you have any other ideas?</i>

04:40.614 --> 04:42.532
Hey, I'm sorry. I gotta get to work.

04:42.533 --> 04:44.826
- <i>All right. Bye.</i>
- Yeah. Bye.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.497
- Hey.
- You need to get your dryer fixed.

04:49.331 --> 04:52.708
Yeah. Or you could just,
like, not live here.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.128
I can't keep coming in and out.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.673
You think they're watching us?

04:58.382 --> 05:00.342
Depends on how dumb you've played it.

05:02.427 --> 05:04.345
Hey, when do we keep going?

05:04.346 --> 05:06.639
Maybe tonight. I'll decide later.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.184
'Cause I haven't remembered anything else.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.604
Right. Well, maybe your innie has.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.851
You took the rest of the weekend
to recover?

05:51.852 --> 05:52.853
I'm fine.

05:54.146 --> 05:56.064
Will I be updating Father later?

06:01.320 --> 06:02.863
He should hear it from me.

06:06.825 --> 06:11.079
We have decided to spare him knowledge
of this contretemps.

06:17.419 --> 06:20.047
Well, please let him know
that his daughter is alive and well.

06:20.547 --> 06:24.134
The medical team
says your tempers will rebalance quickly.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.093
Good to hear.

06:26.094 --> 06:31.058
Some residual trauma is to be expected
after such an ordeal.

06:32.392 --> 06:35.479
Perhaps we could arrange
another obligement session this evening.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.481
I said I'm fine.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.983
We're close, Helena.

06:41.443 --> 06:43.486
What's he at, 78%?

06:43.487 --> 06:46.365
Eighty-one. As of Friday.

06:47.115 --> 06:48.492
It won't be much longer.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.285
You can do this.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.082
I'm not going back down there.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.127
It won't be you. It will be your innie.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.756
My innie who tried to kill me?

07:04.633 --> 07:06.635
And then the other one tried to kill me.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.682
They're fucking animals.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.730
I'll just fake it again.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.275
We can't take that chance.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.651
We need to clean this up.

07:23.652 --> 07:27.531
Milchick's many errors this weekend
have forced our hand.

07:28.699 --> 07:30.450
And Father approves?

07:32.411 --> 07:34.246
Father encouraged it.

07:38.709 --> 07:39.835
<i>It's a risk.</i>

07:40.377 --> 07:41.587
<i>We know this.</i>

07:43.046 --> 07:45.090
<i>But there is no other solution.</i>

07:46.300 --> 07:48.677
<i>Mark S. won't work without her.</i>

07:49.761 --> 07:52.347
And the work is mysterious and important.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.559
So we must give him her.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.901
<i>The Board appreciates your sacrifice.</i>

08:33.554 --> 08:35.182
Good morning, Helly R.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.727
Who the fuck are you?

08:44.274 --> 08:45.734
I'm Miss Huang.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.113
What the hell?

08:50.656 --> 08:52.282
Please follow me.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.743
Mr. Milchick will explain.

09:24.398 --> 09:26.566
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:26.567 --> 09:29.194
- Is she...
- Her innie.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.155
MDR.

09:33.949 --> 09:35.200
Together again.

09:35.951 --> 09:36.952
Come on in.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.829
I need to know what's going on.

09:39.830 --> 09:40.913
Like, right now.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.331
Where's Irving?

09:42.332 --> 09:43.916
And why was he trying to drown me?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.169
'Cause you're a fucking Eagan.

09:45.878 --> 09:48.629
- Was she spying on us?
- Wait, what?

09:48.630 --> 09:49.839
The whole time.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.592
It's called a Glasgow block.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.761
- It allows one's outie to--
- Wait.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.639
Are you saying that she was down here?

09:58.140 --> 09:59.140
As me?

09:59.141 --> 10:00.474
Maybe she still is.

10:00.475 --> 10:03.311
Hey, I repeat myself. Where is Irving?

10:03.312 --> 10:05.354
- Yeah, where is he?
- I'm so confused.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.190
Answer my question!

10:07.191 --> 10:08.901
Excuse me.

10:15.991 --> 10:21.205
Helena Eagan, in her executive capacity,
was conducting valuable research.

10:22.748 --> 10:24.750
By stealing my fucking body?

10:25.292 --> 10:29.505
Irving had no knowledge of what
management's intention was in this action,

10:30.923 --> 10:33.717
and in so doing, he nearly drowned you.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.640
Our only option was permanent dismissal.

10:44.019 --> 10:45.437
So he is dead?

10:47.523 --> 10:48.524
No.

10:49.024 --> 10:52.444
Irving B's outie has departed
on an elongated cruise voyage.

10:54.029 --> 10:57.282
I don't give three dry fucks
about his outie.

10:57.866 --> 11:02.162
She doesn't have
the right to take my identity.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.215
Have you ever heard the story
of the <i>Gråkappan</i>?

11:22.724 --> 11:25.060
Let's assume we haven't.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.902
In ancient times,
the king of Sweden himself

11:34.903 --> 11:38.364
was known to go incognito
amongst his people

11:38.365 --> 11:41.702
in the hopes of learning
their true grievances.

11:43.328 --> 11:47.749
He would don an old, gray robe,
a <i>Gråkappan</i>,

11:48.667 --> 11:50.919
the name for which he was remembered,

11:51.628 --> 11:55.465
to disguise his royal vestments.

11:56.466 --> 12:00.469
Kier Eagan himself was known
to do so in his ether factories,

12:00.470 --> 12:06.018
and Ms. Eagan
was carrying on this noble tradition.

12:10.898 --> 12:13.192
This smells like horseshit.

12:13.775 --> 12:17.905
Yeah. Swedish horseshit,
and Irving is still dead.

12:19.239 --> 12:23.075
As I said, Irving B's outie
has departed on an elonga--

12:23.076 --> 12:25.161
On an elongated cruise voyage.
Yeah, I know.

12:25.162 --> 12:26.914
Is he gonna come back or not?

12:41.553 --> 12:42.721
He is not.

12:46.183 --> 12:48.393
Wow. Some actual honesty.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.355
You fucking murderers.

12:52.356 --> 12:54.107
You can't do this to people.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.195
It will take time to absorb
all that has occurred.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.283
This went well.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.455
Allow me to escort you to MDR

13:10.249 --> 13:12.709
and help reacclimate you
to your work environment.

13:31.228 --> 13:34.064
What in the abominable fuck?

13:47.286 --> 13:48.536
This is you.

13:48.537 --> 13:50.622
Hell no. I'm not going near that thing.

13:51.540 --> 13:53.917
Dylan, please.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.548
If you're taking feedback, I hate it.

14:00.549 --> 14:01.842
Same.

14:06.513 --> 14:12.728
Well, the ORTBO was a challenge for us all
in ways expected and non.

14:19.318 --> 14:22.654
You mean like Jame Eagan's daughter
<i>Gråkappanning</i> us?

14:24.323 --> 14:28.701
Careful, Dylan. Words have consequences.

14:28.702 --> 14:31.330
I'd hate to rescind certain privileges.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.083
As you can see, all of your items

14:36.084 --> 14:38.629
have been moved
to your new work tri-stations.

14:39.213 --> 14:40.880
Hall passes will still be available.

14:40.881 --> 14:42.341
Let us have a funeral.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.635
I'm sorry?

14:45.761 --> 14:48.137
Irving is a person, and he's gone.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.223
So,

14:50.474 --> 14:51.850
we'd like to have a funeral.

14:53.852 --> 14:57.064
Not a retirement party, a funeral.

14:58.065 --> 14:59.066
Right?

15:01.109 --> 15:02.361
Yeah.

15:05.239 --> 15:06.365
A funeral.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.451
Is this MDR's position?

15:10.452 --> 15:11.620
Dude?

15:12.579 --> 15:13.580
Little help?

15:16.625 --> 15:19.085
Sure. As long as it's quick.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.254
- Quick?
- Quick. Yes.

15:21.255 --> 15:23.631
So it doesn't take up the whole day.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.092
Well said, Mark.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.635
I'll see if we can
pull something together.

15:27.636 --> 15:32.140
In the meantime, let's make some
forward progress on the files at hand.

15:32.641 --> 15:33.642
Shall we?

15:34.476 --> 15:35.769
Thank you.

15:37.229 --> 15:38.438
Not you.

16:01.044 --> 16:05.173
Miss Huang, we need to ready
a bereavement kit for MDR.

16:05.174 --> 16:06.717
Meet me in the back office.

16:18.729 --> 16:19.730
Mark?

16:21.148 --> 16:22.149
Hello?

16:24.234 --> 16:25.652
I'm gonna come in.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.030
I'm coming in.

16:32.701 --> 16:33.702
Hey.

16:36.455 --> 16:37.705
Are you okay?

16:37.706 --> 16:39.499
Uh-huh. No, not really.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.128
Yeah. This is seriously fucked up.

16:44.129 --> 16:45.214
Yeah.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.387
You couldn't tell?

16:53.096 --> 16:54.348
That she wasn't me?

16:56.225 --> 16:57.601
Obviously not.

16:59.436 --> 17:00.562
What was she like?

17:06.151 --> 17:07.693
Like you.

17:07.694 --> 17:11.572
Or you're like her? I don't know.

17:11.573 --> 17:15.160
I don't know who you are, I guess.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.540
Yes, you do.

17:20.374 --> 17:21.375
Okay.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.129
It's not my fault
that my outie hijacked me.

17:27.130 --> 17:30.217
Yeah. No, totally. I get it. It sucks.

17:34.012 --> 17:35.721
- Mark...
- Yeah.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.474
What happened to you up there?

17:40.018 --> 17:41.018
Doesn't matter.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.562
- It doesn't matter?
- No.

17:42.563 --> 17:44.146
Don't you want to hear
what happened to me?

17:44.147 --> 17:48.318
No, I don't.
And let's just try to forget it. Okay?

18:13.677 --> 18:17.014
I thought bereavement events
were for innies who die on the floor.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.058
Yes.

18:21.518 --> 18:25.189
Well, the Affections Index for Irving B.
was in the high 60s.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.025
It will help the others to grieve.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.865
May I say a question?

18:35.657 --> 18:36.658
You may.

18:39.912 --> 18:42.247
You shouldn't let them have a funeral.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.959
It makes them feel like people.

18:48.253 --> 18:49.755
That wasn't a question.

18:50.589 --> 18:51.757
That was an opinion.

18:53.133 --> 18:54.468
Unsolicited.

19:06.355 --> 19:09.149
Your first performance review
is today, right?

19:19.868 --> 19:21.370
That was a question.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.250
I'll ready the refreshments.

19:27.251 --> 19:29.586
You focus on the mournful signage.

19:41.098 --> 19:43.267
<i>Today we honor Irving B.</i>

19:45.519 --> 19:47.436
<i>Normally, when an innie
goes to be with Kier,</i>

19:47.437 --> 19:51.275
<i>we hold a retirement party,
which they attend.</i>

19:52.609 --> 19:56.321
But given the sudden
and frigid events which brought us here,

19:57.281 --> 19:58.574
that's not feasible.

20:00.117 --> 20:02.493
As such, let us each take nine seconds

20:02.494 --> 20:07.583
to silently remember Irving
and thank Kier for our time with him.

20:12.754 --> 20:16.383
There. You may now lift your heads
and open your eyes.

20:16.925 --> 20:19.845
We will now have a eulogy from Dylan G.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.822
It's hard to pinpoint
a favorite Irving story.

20:40.616 --> 20:43.243
For the least fun guy in the world,
he was really fun.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.664
He put the "dick" in contradiction.

20:50.501 --> 20:53.754
One time, he was pissed at me
for watering down the toner,

20:54.379 --> 20:56.715
so he put toner in my water cup.

20:57.966 --> 20:59.383
He stopped me before I drank it, though.

20:59.384 --> 21:03.055
He just wanted to make a point,
not harm me physically.

21:05.265 --> 21:09.645
But I did accidentally take a sip of it
later 'cause I forgot he said that.

21:12.606 --> 21:17.194
He asked me for help with something
near the end, and I didn't listen.

21:19.112 --> 21:21.113
And in his final moments,

21:21.114 --> 21:25.702
he would have been totally justified
in telling me to suck my own fuck.

21:26.495 --> 21:28.038
But he didn't.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.251
Yeah.

21:35.879 --> 21:37.464
He was awesome, and I miss him.

21:42.594 --> 21:44.137
Thank you, Dylan G.

21:44.930 --> 21:48.600
A little sugar with your usual salt.

21:52.938 --> 21:55.649
Thank you for your attendance
and your participation.

21:56.567 --> 22:00.737
You may now briefly partake
in Irving's fruit head,

22:01.446 --> 22:04.741
whose dark hair is courtesy
of the Black Beauty Watermelon.

22:05.242 --> 22:07.828
From the country of Malaysia.

22:12.457 --> 22:13.667
Miss Huang.

22:28.182 --> 22:29.807
I thought I was going to perform.

22:29.808 --> 22:33.187
Yes, well, I feel the theremin
works best in moderation.

22:33.687 --> 22:36.106
- But I practiced--
- You can play your piece for me later.

22:36.690 --> 22:37.691
Yes?

23:02.674 --> 23:03.759
You okay?

23:06.261 --> 23:07.596
How about you?

23:08.222 --> 23:09.223
Okay.

23:13.727 --> 23:14.728
You're not staying?

23:15.395 --> 23:18.731
I gotta get to work,
but great ceremony, guys.

23:18.732 --> 23:20.067
Seriously?

23:22.402 --> 23:24.613
I mean, isn't it kind of over?

23:25.405 --> 23:26.405
Mark...

23:26.406 --> 23:27.741
Just let him go.

23:29.034 --> 23:32.411
- What?
- Irving was your friend, and he's dead.

23:32.412 --> 23:35.164
- Why don't you give a shit?
- Because he's not dead.

23:35.165 --> 23:36.834
He's just not here.

23:39.127 --> 23:40.128
You two catch up?

23:41.505 --> 23:42.506
What's that?

23:45.342 --> 23:47.177
You tell her Ms. Casey's your wife yet?

23:50.806 --> 23:51.974
Wait, what?

23:53.559 --> 23:55.768
Yeah, I mean,
it's my outie's wife, but sure...

23:55.769 --> 23:57.688
No, it's pretty crazy.

24:00.566 --> 24:01.567
Mark.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.573
Mark, what the hell?

24:09.575 --> 24:11.868
- Why won't you talk to me?
- What do you want to talk about, Helly?

24:11.869 --> 24:14.705
I don't know. Maybe the fact
that Ms. Casey's your outie's wife?

24:15.205 --> 24:16.206
What are we gonna do?

24:17.291 --> 24:19.083
Well, we're not gonna do anything.

24:19.084 --> 24:20.168
Not gonna do anything?

24:20.169 --> 24:23.212
- Seriously?
- Yes. Seriously.

24:23.213 --> 24:26.132
Come on. We'll work as a team.
We'll figure this out.

24:26.133 --> 24:29.218
- "We'll"? There's no "we," Helly.
- What?

24:29.219 --> 24:31.721
- It doesn't matter.
- Why?

24:31.722 --> 24:32.847
- Why?
- Yeah. Why?

24:32.848 --> 24:35.516
Because they are smarter than us, okay?

24:35.517 --> 24:37.143
They know everything.

24:37.144 --> 24:39.770
Me looking for Ms. Casey,

24:39.771 --> 24:42.398
us wandering around,
meeting other departments,

24:42.399 --> 24:43.858
mapping the floor, all of it.

24:43.859 --> 24:45.818
They know everything we're doing

24:45.819 --> 24:49.907
because Helena told them
everything we're doing.

24:50.574 --> 24:51.783
That wasn't me.

24:52.868 --> 24:55.662
Mark, lo... I'm not her. I'm not.

24:57.581 --> 24:58.707
I'm me.

25:00.834 --> 25:01.835
Helly.

25:03.045 --> 25:04.546
And how do I know that?

25:10.677 --> 25:12.346
You don't.

25:14.598 --> 25:16.225
You just have to trust me.

25:20.812 --> 25:22.147
This is real.

25:27.528 --> 25:29.571
Not everything here is a lie.

25:36.662 --> 25:38.664
And stop being a fucking asshole.

25:46.839 --> 25:51.301
Your first performance review
as Department Chief. Excited?

25:53.887 --> 25:55.180
Very much so.

25:56.306 --> 25:57.598
Shall we?

25:57.599 --> 26:00.184
Natalie, just before we begin,

26:00.185 --> 26:02.396
I was wondering
if I could have a word with you.

26:09.278 --> 26:10.362
The paintings.

26:12.114 --> 26:15.200
I want you to understand
I am grateful for them.

26:15.868 --> 26:16.869
Truly.

26:17.494 --> 26:20.789
If they're a measure of appreciation,
then I accept that appreciation.

26:27.671 --> 26:29.964
I was just wondering
if you could share with me a little

26:29.965 --> 26:33.927
how you felt
when you received the paintings.

26:34.887 --> 26:35.888
Because I'm thinking

26:36.930 --> 26:40.017
our experiences here
have been similar in some ways,

26:41.768 --> 26:43.687
we face similar challenges,

26:44.438 --> 26:48.859
and perhaps the paintings and the
somewhat complicated feelings they evoke.

26:57.534 --> 26:58.785
Mr. Drummond's waiting.

27:00.454 --> 27:01.830
Yes, of course.

27:04.917 --> 27:05.918
Let us go.

27:21.642 --> 27:23.060
Okay, asshole.

27:24.561 --> 27:25.812
Guess this is it.

27:27.856 --> 27:29.149
Sorry I let you down.

28:34.339 --> 28:35.841
<i>Welcome, Mr. Milchick.</i>

28:36.967 --> 28:40.429
Today, I will be conducting
your monthly performance review.

28:41.305 --> 28:43.764
This review can take
anywhere from two to six hours,

28:43.765 --> 28:47.602
depending on the number of atonements
and approbations required.

28:47.603 --> 28:50.271
If the review is to take longer
than four hours,

28:50.272 --> 28:54.567
there will be a break for lunch,
with the order taken in advance.

28:54.568 --> 28:56.820
Well, I hope that won't be necessary.

28:59.281 --> 29:01.033
Here is the lunch menu.

29:09.958 --> 29:11.835
Let's start with the positives.

29:12.336 --> 29:16.672
You received the gift
of Kier paintings with grace.

29:16.673 --> 29:19.884
Your attendance and urinalysis
are both in the excellent range.

29:19.885 --> 29:21.385
Wonderful.

29:21.386 --> 29:23.971
Alternatively and sadly,

29:23.972 --> 29:27.976
there have been three contentions
reported anonymously

29:28.685 --> 29:31.104
which have been investigated
and confirmed.

29:33.857 --> 29:36.860
"One: uses too many big words."

29:38.862 --> 29:41.322
Well, perchance I may
colloquially employ a--

29:41.323 --> 29:44.826
Anti-deflections will be heard
after the lunch break.

29:45.494 --> 29:46.494
Yes, sorry.

29:46.495 --> 29:50.623
Two: on several of your daily logs,

29:50.624 --> 29:53.751
the paper clip
was installed back to front,

29:53.752 --> 29:58.298
which led to a confusion as to where
in the document to begin reading.

29:59.007 --> 30:01.218
Here are the incidents.

30:03.053 --> 30:07.224
But the bulk of our day
will revolve around the following.

30:07.766 --> 30:12.019
You brought in
a new refining team for Mark S.

30:12.020 --> 30:14.022
which failed to coalesce.

30:14.523 --> 30:16.524
You instituted kindness reforms.

30:16.525 --> 30:18.526
Because I'm not Harmony Cobel.

30:18.527 --> 30:23.739
Kindness reforms
that seemed to have, in no way,

30:23.740 --> 30:28.286
deterred curiosity or idling by the team
once they returned.

30:28.287 --> 30:32.790
You arranged an outdoor retreat
and team-building occurrence

30:32.791 --> 30:35.502
which resulted in the termination
of one employee,

30:36.086 --> 30:38.713
and the discovery
of the true identity of another

30:38.714 --> 30:41.758
at great risk and harm to the Eagan name.

30:59.276 --> 31:04.281
<i>Look, Seth, Mark Scout's completion
of Cold Harbor...</i>

31:05.157 --> 31:06.532
will be remembered

31:06.533 --> 31:10.370
as one of the greatest moments
in the history of this planet.

31:11.371 --> 31:14.499
It will take place under your stewardship.

31:15.375 --> 31:17.460
<i>That's quite a legacy you will leave.</i>

31:17.461 --> 31:18.670
<i>Thank you, Mr. Drummond.</i>

31:19.838 --> 31:21.381
That means a great deal.

31:24.218 --> 31:27.179
<i>This milestone seems
to have clouded your judgment.</i>

31:27.763 --> 31:31.099
I think it's time to go
back to the basics, Seth.

31:31.683 --> 31:34.603
To remember these severed workers'
greater purpose...

31:39.566 --> 31:43.237
and to treat them as what they really are.

32:30.909 --> 32:32.494
I'm tightening the leash.

32:53.265 --> 32:54.266
Hi, Mark.

32:54.808 --> 32:56.225
Mr. Milchick.

32:56.226 --> 32:58.728
I see you left work six minutes early.

32:58.729 --> 32:59.938
May I come in?

33:08.363 --> 33:10.199
How was the rest of the funeral?

33:11.033 --> 33:12.826
Did you get what you needed from it?

33:14.369 --> 33:16.038
Yeah, sure.

33:18.332 --> 33:21.502
Hey, did Miss Huang take notes?

33:22.503 --> 33:26.422
I can't wait to read her article about it
in that newspaper you showed me.

33:26.423 --> 33:27.883
What was it called again?

33:28.884 --> 33:31.178
<i>The Bullshit Gazette</i>?

33:33.847 --> 33:37.767
Hopefully, now we can put
all this grief and tumult behind us

33:37.768 --> 33:40.728
and look forward
to some productive workdays ahead.

33:40.729 --> 33:44.065
You mean
putting the numbers in the thing--

33:44.066 --> 33:45.483
- Refining.
- Right.

33:45.484 --> 33:47.777
Yes. Does that sound good?

33:47.778 --> 33:49.987
Whatever you say, Mr. Milchick.

33:49.988 --> 33:51.240
Praise Kier.

34:00.916 --> 34:02.668
Did you and Helly R. catch up?

34:04.169 --> 34:05.086
We did.

34:05.087 --> 34:08.465
Did you tell her that you
fucked her outie at the ORTBO?

34:14.012 --> 34:15.389
Helena Eagan,

34:16.473 --> 34:18.684
leader-in-waiting of this company.

34:30.320 --> 34:31.612
Have a restful evening.

34:51.842 --> 34:53.510
<i>"The workers were diligent,</i>

34:54.261 --> 34:56.138
<i>focused on the task at hand.</i>

34:57.639 --> 35:01.727
<i>Pleasantly surprised, I noticed
that not a single worker had a watch.</i>

35:02.769 --> 35:05.772
<i>They simply referenced
a large standard clock near the door,</i>

35:06.356 --> 35:09.193
<i>just hands and numbers
and cogs and purpose.</i>

35:10.110 --> 35:13.237
Your sovereign boss may own the clock
that greets you from the wall,

35:13.238 --> 35:16.992
but you get to enjoy its ticking
and thus should be happy."

35:20.204 --> 35:21.204
Yes.

35:21.205 --> 35:24.374
Babe, it's the literal opposite
of what you were saying before.

35:26.168 --> 35:27.169
Okay.

35:27.753 --> 35:31.172
I see how you'd feel that way.

35:31.173 --> 35:33.257
But one point that Nat made was--

35:33.258 --> 35:34.343
Nat, okay.

35:36.053 --> 35:40.598
She said that innies tend to thrive
in an environment of structure,

35:40.599 --> 35:42.350
and once that is established,

35:42.351 --> 35:45.186
then they are more open to self-expansion.

35:45.187 --> 35:47.730
So I am just trying
to speak their language.

35:47.731 --> 35:50.149
I know, but this sounds
like Lumon's language.

35:50.150 --> 35:52.985
Well, it's a Trojan's horse.

35:52.986 --> 35:56.489
If I can get my ideas
to severed workers all across the world,

35:56.490 --> 35:59.617
it might beget a revolution.

35:59.618 --> 36:01.370
But these aren't your ideas.

36:01.995 --> 36:04.497
These are not your ideas, and also...

36:04.498 --> 36:05.582
Whatever.

36:06.291 --> 36:07.291
And what?

36:07.292 --> 36:10.545
Okay, Lumon hurts people, you know that,
and if you want to water down your work

36:10.546 --> 36:12.755
so they can use it
for their fucking propaganda,

36:12.756 --> 36:14.173
then you're hurting people too.

36:14.174 --> 36:17.718
Okay. I will reflect on your words.

36:17.719 --> 36:18.846
Thank you.

36:20.931 --> 36:23.433
And also,

36:24.810 --> 36:28.521
this is a fiscal and creative opportunity

36:28.522 --> 36:30.524
unlike any I have yet seen.

36:32.025 --> 36:34.611
And I'm not inclined
to just walk away from it.

36:36.697 --> 36:40.074
Unless me selling
millions of copies of my book

36:40.075 --> 36:44.705
and the life that that manages to give us
has somehow lost its appeal for you.

36:47.583 --> 36:49.501
Okay. Whatever. I'm gonna go to bed.

36:50.085 --> 36:52.461
No. Babe.

36:52.462 --> 36:53.630
No, thank you.

37:52.981 --> 37:54.358
It's me again.

37:55.234 --> 37:57.985
So, they fired me.

37:57.986 --> 38:00.571
I think they knew what my innie was up to.

38:00.572 --> 38:02.199
I'm telling you to--

38:04.451 --> 38:05.327
I have to go.

38:14.127 --> 38:15.128
Hey!

38:17.256 --> 38:18.257
Hey!

38:19.258 --> 38:22.010
You. Why are you following me?

38:26.431 --> 38:27.515
I got this thing.

38:27.516 --> 38:33.146
When somebody shows up on my doorstep
screaming my name, I wanna know why.

38:33.647 --> 38:35.023
Call it a quirk.

38:37.401 --> 38:38.735
You're with Lumon.

38:43.740 --> 38:45.909
Why were you at my house the other night?

38:49.329 --> 38:50.539
I don't know.

38:51.582 --> 38:54.251
It wasn't you at all, was it?

38:54.751 --> 38:55.752
You're severed.

39:01.216 --> 39:03.843
I got canned a couple of weeks ago.

39:03.844 --> 39:05.178
When I pressed them for a reason,

39:05.179 --> 39:10.266
they said my innie had an unsanctioned,
erotic entanglement with another worker.

39:10.267 --> 39:11.852
They wouldn't tell me who.

39:14.188 --> 39:17.274
Then you show up at my door.

39:22.654 --> 39:24.323
You think we were an item?

39:24.948 --> 39:27.116
Well, Fields certainly thinks so.

39:27.117 --> 39:30.162
We had to cancel our trip to Milwaukee.
Thanks for that.

39:31.246 --> 39:34.791
- Fields?
- That's my husband, Fields.

39:35.417 --> 39:37.376
I'm sorry.

39:37.377 --> 39:38.878
Yeah, well...

39:38.879 --> 39:41.381
And I'm sorry I came at you just now.

39:44.134 --> 39:45.177
It's fine.

39:50.724 --> 39:53.435
Maybe you could-- I don't know.

39:54.686 --> 39:55.687
What?

39:57.231 --> 40:00.234
We got a ham.
We're planning to have it tomorrow.

40:00.734 --> 40:05.364
Might be nice if you come over.
We could sit down, talk through it all.

40:08.784 --> 40:10.285
You, me, and...

40:11.119 --> 40:12.120
Fields.

40:17.793 --> 40:19.085
I suppose.

40:19.086 --> 40:20.295
Great.

40:21.797 --> 40:22.965
We like red wine.

40:23.715 --> 40:24.715
Expensive.

40:24.716 --> 40:26.844
Okay. Tomorrow.

40:28.929 --> 40:30.013
You need a lift?

40:30.806 --> 40:32.265
I'll walk. Thanks.

40:32.266 --> 40:33.350
You sure?

40:34.560 --> 40:36.019
I know where you live.

40:41.567 --> 40:44.403
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes.

41:19.479 --> 41:21.648
Sorry there wasn't any eggnog.

41:22.191 --> 41:23.942
Might be out of season.

41:25.694 --> 41:27.069
What the fuck are you doing?

41:27.070 --> 41:30.240
I needed some pressure points.
Things to rattle your memories.

41:30.782 --> 41:31.908
- Knitting?
- Yeah.

41:31.909 --> 41:34.578
She said it gave her time to think.

41:39.374 --> 41:40.375
That her?

41:42.461 --> 41:44.004
What I thought was her.

41:51.845 --> 41:54.264
She's not dead. She's just not here.

41:57.643 --> 41:58.977
Who's in there?

42:00.437 --> 42:02.438
They know people at the morgue.

42:02.439 --> 42:05.192
On the payroll,
like everywhere else in Kier.

42:09.530 --> 42:11.031
You feel all right?

42:13.075 --> 42:16.786
Basically. So, are we gonna...

42:16.787 --> 42:17.871
One more day.

42:19.498 --> 42:21.041
Usually that's best.

42:22.084 --> 42:24.377
Usually? You've done this once.

42:24.378 --> 42:25.837
I don't wanna rush things.

42:25.838 --> 42:27.088
There's risk.

42:27.089 --> 42:28.840
It's not an exact science, Mark.

42:28.841 --> 42:32.135
I'm not sure it's science,
period, but okay.

42:35.305 --> 42:36.890
You good on snacks?

42:37.474 --> 42:38.517
For now.

42:58.412 --> 42:59.746
Are they hurting her?

43:04.126 --> 43:05.419
I don't know.
