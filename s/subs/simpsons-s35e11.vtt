No time for donuts. I've got to
get to work. Work, work, work.

Uh, who do you think
you're fooling?

01:05.900 --> 01:10.027
Sometimes the most important
person to fool is yourself.

01:24.001 --> 01:25.834
When did I go
from an up-and-comer

01:25.920 --> 01:29.046
To a guy who drinks
other people's beer?

01:29.173 --> 01:31.006

01:31.133 --> 01:33.133
-A leprechaun.
-Again?

You know, you start
with huge dreams,

01:50.986 --> 01:52.486
But after 20 years
at that plant,

01:52.571 --> 01:55.614
All I've got is a big ball
of rubber bands.

Then you realize,
you even failed at that.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.333
Oh, that's terribly sad.

02:06.418 --> 02:07.417
Mm.

Scooching over.
Scooching, scooching...

02:10.131 --> 02:12.297
Too far.
I share your disappointment,

02:12.424 --> 02:13.966
You see, because by this point,

02:14.051 --> 02:17.010
I thought I'd have won
a prestigious research grant.

02:17.138 --> 02:19.429

[homer]
wow.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.770
I never knew smart people
could be unhappy.

02:26.856 --> 02:29.314
Oh, my, that's a tear.
I have empathy,

02:29.441 --> 02:32.568
Which means that I am,
in fact, human,

At the new nuclear plant
in shelbyville.

02:42.580 --> 02:46.874
Me? Are you sure you don't want
somebody younger or more lenny?

02:47.042 --> 02:50.502
No, you. I've never seen
a résumé like this.

02:50.588 --> 02:53.213
Technically, several of those
jobs were court-ordered.

great.

Woo-hoo! Finally, a use
for this ring light

03:01.307 --> 03:03.265
I've been lugging around.
Could this be it?

03:03.350 --> 03:06.727
The moment my life finally
changes for the better.

03:14.195 --> 03:17.237
Oh, homie.
This never would've happened

you're gonna screw it up.

Well, I'm your ambition,
and I say you're gonna blow it.

03:29.793 --> 03:31.460
-Screw it up.
-Blow it.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.461

Blow it.

no one loves you.

03:36.717 --> 03:39.009
As usual, my imagination
is right.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.594
I'll never get that job.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.348
Sir, I will help you
with the power of science.

03:44.433 --> 03:46.934
What does science have to do
with nuclear science?

03:47.061 --> 03:48.310
And why you?

03:48.437 --> 03:51.897
Well, as success stories go,
I may not be an egnot,

03:51.941 --> 03:53.899
But I can certainly help you.

03:53.943 --> 03:55.150

Oh, it's okay, homie.
We're fine.

Are we? I won't have a wife
of mine mending vacuum bags.

04:19.927 --> 04:22.210
You'll get new vacuum bags.

04:22.304 --> 04:25.889

04:41.532 --> 04:43.907
Aren't they just

Of course it's just me.
Frink's here for moral support.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.080
Well, why can't I give you
moral support?

04:50.165 --> 04:53.041
Because your moral support
always comes with conditions.

04:53.127 --> 04:55.002
I shouldn't drink so much.

04:55.087 --> 04:58.213
I should stay alive

Are you coming back to work

20:30.563 --> 20:31.771
Um, is there a box

20:31.940 --> 20:34.815
For "preposterous scheme
