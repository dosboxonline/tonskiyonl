WEBVTT

00:50.383 --> 00:51.884
You know in

00:52.050 --> 00:53.261
middle school, I spent

00:53.261 --> 00:54.595
a whole summer inside.

00:54.595 --> 00:55.889
I didn't go out.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.848
Didn't want kids to make fun

00:57.848 --> 00:58.849
of my braces.

00:58.849 --> 01:01.518
But this...

01:01.518 --> 01:05.899
no walls... no ceiling.

01:05.899 --> 01:08.234
For the first time in

01:08.234 --> 01:09.152
eight years...

01:09.152 --> 01:10.987
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm not gonna lie,
it's kind of freaking me out.

01:10.987 --> 01:13.615
I'm not gonna lie,
it's kind of freaking me out.

01:15.908 --> 01:18.077
Does it freak you out?

01:18.077 --> 01:19.871
Not one bit.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.664
But you with braces?

01:24.750 --> 01:26.836
Right, radiation levels

01:26.836 --> 01:28.962
normal for now.

01:28.962 --> 01:31.800
Outside temperature is minus

01:31.800 --> 01:32.634
one-seventeen.

01:32.634 --> 01:35.053
Maybe it was a satellite
Maybe it was a satellite
that fell out of orbit?

01:35.053 --> 01:36.845
Maybe it was a satellite
that fell out of orbit?

01:40.809 --> 01:42.351
The rocket's trajectory

01:42.351 --> 01:43.977
was leaving the atmosphere,

01:43.977 --> 01:45.146
not entering it.

01:45.146 --> 01:47.649
Could have been a failsafe

01:47.649 --> 01:48.649
triggered automatically

01:48.649 --> 01:50.652
by who knows what.

01:50.652 --> 01:53.612
A rat chewing a wire.

01:53.612 --> 01:55.115
Yeah, well,

01:55.115 --> 01:56.116
anything's possible.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.576
Tell you what, let's get
Tell you what, let's get
these samples and keep going.

01:58.576 --> 02:00.911
Tell you what, let's get
these samples and keep going.

02:03.915 --> 02:07.042
Snowpiercer, this is Ben.

02:07.042 --> 02:09.587
Do you read me?

02:09.587 --> 02:12.172
Mel, do you copy?

02:12.172 --> 02:13.423
Come in.
Come in.
Some kind of interference

02:13.423 --> 02:15.093
Come in.
Some kind of interference

02:25.145 --> 02:27.188
Ben?

02:39.200 --> 02:41.869
Holy shit.

02:48.208 --> 02:49.711
They were waiting for us.

02:57.885 --> 03:01.389
The end of the line

03:01.389 --> 03:03.808
That's what I thought when

03:03.933 --> 03:05.684
the trains split apart.

03:05.684 --> 03:07.102
Who knew we'd
Who knew we'd
end up like this?

03:07.102 --> 03:08.229
Who knew we'd
end up like this?

03:13.610 --> 03:15.320
I got it. I got it.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.404
You didn't need to run off

03:17.404 --> 03:19.199
like a crazy person. She's fine.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.700
Give me a second.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.743
Do you need to sit down?

03:22.743 --> 03:23.952
You're gonna pass out.

03:23.952 --> 03:24.828
I'm just...

03:24.828 --> 03:26.331
Well look, wait 'til nap

03:26.331 --> 03:27.790
time and she's screaming for

03:27.790 --> 03:29.583
her Gibby then who's the hero?

03:29.583 --> 03:30.500
Clearly Gibby.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.253
Alright, now that you got

03:32.253 --> 03:33.463
your morning run in,

03:33.463 --> 03:34.755
how 'bout we get to work?

03:35.839 --> 03:37.926
Wait, wait, it's cold out.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.344
She needs her parka.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.385
Get mine.

03:40.385 --> 03:41.762
I'll get your...

03:41.762 --> 03:43.514
Turns out

03:43.514 --> 03:45.225
my mother was right.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.476
Before she passed on, she held

03:47.476 --> 03:49.729
my hand and said, "Don't worry,

03:49.729 --> 03:51.231
son, endings are just
son, endings are just
beginnings in disguise.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.189
son, endings are just
beginnings in disguise.

04:00.531 --> 04:02.491
This is a new beginning.

04:02.491 --> 04:05.702
A New Eden

04:05.702 --> 04:07.664
filled with survivors

04:07.664 --> 04:09.707
looking for a second chance.

04:09.707 --> 04:12.794
No doubt, the open sky

04:12.794 --> 04:15.880
has been a gift but

04:15.880 --> 04:17.757
growing food, generating

04:17.757 --> 04:19.592
power, fighting unpredictable

04:19.592 --> 04:22.678
weather, it's been a struggle.

04:22.678 --> 04:25.974
Almost as hard as trying to

04:25.974 --> 04:28.767
make contact with our friends,

04:28.767 --> 04:30.395
wondering if they're

04:30.395 --> 04:33.147
still alive out there on
still alive out there on
Snowpiercer, 879 cars long.

04:33.147 --> 04:35.190
still alive out there on
Snowpiercer, 879 cars long.

05:16.149 --> 05:21.570
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:21.570 --> 05:22.779
Is the council meeting

05:22.779 --> 05:23.613
tonight?

05:23.613 --> 05:24.448
Yeah.

05:24.448 --> 05:26.241
Do you think you could take her?

05:26.241 --> 05:27.452
Yeah. Just come on

05:27.452 --> 05:28.368
by in the morning.

05:28.368 --> 05:29.495
I'll make sure to pack

05:29.495 --> 05:30.330
the bunny.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.707
Hey, yeah, what's up?

05:32.707 --> 05:34.000
Hey, do you think Headwood

05:34.000 --> 05:35.543
has time for a treatment today?

05:35.543 --> 05:36.544
Yeah, we'll make

05:36.544 --> 05:37.378
time for you.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.378
Are you getting

05:38.378 --> 05:39.380
your feeling back?

05:39.380 --> 05:40.380
Yeah. I mean,

05:40.380 --> 05:42.049
some areas are responding

05:42.049 --> 05:43.051
better than others.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.385
I mean, my hand is almost

05:44.385 --> 05:45.719
completely back to normal.

05:45.719 --> 05:47.805
Hey, look, how lucky.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.390
Actual blueberries.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.517
Ooh, yum.

05:51.517 --> 05:52.935
Hey, so I've been working

05:52.935 --> 05:54.395
on that transceiver glitch.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.854
I think the far relay is too

05:55.854 --> 05:57.231
close to the edge of the pocket.

05:57.231 --> 05:58.190
Yeah, good morning

05:58.190 --> 05:59.024
to you, too, Javi.

05:59.024 --> 05:59.859
Hey, guys.

05:59.859 --> 06:00.818
I should get to the clinic.

06:00.818 --> 06:02.027
I'll just catch you guys later.

06:02.027 --> 06:03.070
Yeah.

06:03.070 --> 06:04.072
Thank you.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.406
Based on projections,

06:05.406 --> 06:06.782
we've got about a week

06:06.782 --> 06:07.825
before Snowpiercer

06:07.825 --> 06:09.202
reaches radio range.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.243
Yeah, these atmospheric

06:10.243 --> 06:11.871
conditions are not helping.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.246
They're all over the place.

06:13.246 --> 06:14.582
I think they're affecting

06:14.582 --> 06:17.584
the signal.

06:17.584 --> 06:18.835
But I was thinking maybe

06:18.835 --> 06:20.380
we could run diagnostics,

06:20.380 --> 06:21.923
check the feedline, maybe

06:21.923 --> 06:23.966
move one of the relays?

06:23.966 --> 06:25.926
Yes, okay. I'll help.

06:25.926 --> 06:26.885
Thank you.

06:26.885 --> 06:29.387
See you tonight.

06:39.190 --> 06:40.024
I mean, the fact that

06:40.024 --> 06:41.067
we still have everyone living

06:41.067 --> 06:42.109
on the train after a year.

06:42.109 --> 06:43.111
I'd hoped for much better.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.779
Shelters are next on the list

06:44.779 --> 06:45.863
after we fix the bridge.

06:45.863 --> 06:47.239
It took up a lot of manpower.

06:47.239 --> 06:48.366
Is that still on schedule

06:48.366 --> 06:49.282
to finish this week?

06:49.282 --> 06:51.952
It's... we'll get there.

06:51.952 --> 06:52.954
We'd better.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.621
You know, it's piling up.

06:54.621 --> 06:55.539
Between the shelters,

06:55.539 --> 06:56.373
the power grid--

06:56.373 --> 06:57.625
I know, and the relay issues.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.126
The fun never stops.

06:59.126 --> 07:00.460
Are we having relay issues?

07:00.460 --> 07:01.796
Hmm?

07:01.796 --> 07:04.005
Where'd you hear that?

07:04.005 --> 07:05.298
Oh, take me back

07:05.298 --> 07:06.133
to the Teals.

07:06.133 --> 07:08.094
Hey, I think that

07:08.094 --> 07:09.469
"rugged town Mayer" suits you

07:09.469 --> 07:12.306
better than the Teals.

07:12.306 --> 07:13.640
Sorry to bother you, Ruth,

07:13.640 --> 07:15.226
but Sykes needs you in Ag-Sec.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.853
Something about the irrigation

07:16.853 --> 07:17.686
in car A-14.

07:17.686 --> 07:18.938
Ooh, there it is.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.147
Let's add irrigation to the

07:20.147 --> 07:21.149
ever-growing list of problems

07:21.149 --> 07:21.983
for tonight's meeting.

07:21.983 --> 07:22.817
On it.

07:22.817 --> 07:23.734
That is, if you'll be

07:23.734 --> 07:25.152
joining us, Councilman Layton?

07:25.152 --> 07:26.070
Wouldn't miss it,

07:26.070 --> 07:28.322
Council Chair Wardell.

07:48.508 --> 07:49.885
Man, I don't know what

07:49.885 --> 07:51.637
everybody's complaining about.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.055
We got open sky, fresh air...

07:53.055 --> 07:53.972
They're complaining

07:53.972 --> 07:55.849
a lot, or a little?

07:55.849 --> 07:56.892
Medium. Either way,

07:56.892 --> 07:58.226
beats the days of the Tail,

07:58.226 --> 07:59.270
know what I'm saying?

07:59.270 --> 08:00.520
Hey!

08:02.272 --> 08:04.692
Hey! Hey!

08:04.692 --> 08:06.359
Cut it out!

08:06.359 --> 08:08.945
Hey, break it up, Boki!

08:08.945 --> 08:10.907
Put him down!

08:11.782 --> 08:12.616
Stop, stop!

08:12.616 --> 08:14.743
What is wrong with y'all?

08:14.743 --> 08:15.702
He doesn't pay attention!

08:15.702 --> 08:16.536
He almost killed me

08:16.536 --> 08:17.370
with the beam!

08:17.370 --> 08:18.372
Well, you weren't looking,

08:18.372 --> 08:19.206
you bloody Frankenstein.

08:19.206 --> 08:21.209
He's drunk. He's drunk!

08:21.209 --> 08:22.042
He's always drunk!

08:22.042 --> 08:22.877
Hey! All right!

08:22.877 --> 08:23.710
We don't have time

08:23.710 --> 08:24.545
for this shit.

08:24.545 --> 08:25.796
We are so close to

08:25.796 --> 08:27.632
finishing this bridge.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.550
Look at you, man.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.383
You're a mess.

08:30.383 --> 08:32.219
Go get yourself stitched up.

08:32.219 --> 08:33.637
This is not the paradise

08:33.637 --> 08:36.349
we were promised.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.732
Try not to use this hand

08:44.732 --> 08:45.690
for a few days.

08:45.690 --> 08:47.276
If you make a fist, it will

08:47.276 --> 08:48.569
rip the stitches, okay?

08:48.569 --> 08:50.028
Mm-hmm.

08:52.614 --> 08:54.492
Ya!

08:54.492 --> 08:56.493
Wanna tell me what happened?

08:56.493 --> 08:58.620
Not really, no.

09:00.956 --> 09:01.831
I hear the bridge

09:01.831 --> 09:04.001
is almost done.

09:04.001 --> 09:05.253
I don't understand

09:05.253 --> 09:06.878
why we're trying to reunite

09:06.878 --> 09:07.796
with those people.

09:07.796 --> 09:09.214
You mean Snowpiercer?

09:09.214 --> 09:10.633
Yeah.

09:10.633 --> 09:12.343
Well, some of our

09:12.343 --> 09:14.387
friends are still on that train.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.263
Yeah, not mine.

09:16.263 --> 09:18.266
Well, if you have any issues

09:18.266 --> 09:19.934
you can always bring them up

09:19.934 --> 09:21.602
at the Council at Town Hall.

09:21.602 --> 09:23.229
Hey, they have music there

09:23.229 --> 09:24.062
sometimes.

09:24.062 --> 09:25.064
You used to play

09:25.064 --> 09:27.440
the piano, right?

09:27.440 --> 09:29.109
Yeah, sometimes.

09:29.109 --> 09:30.777
In the Nightcar.

09:30.777 --> 09:31.945
Well, maybe if it comes

09:31.945 --> 09:34.156
back, you can play again.

09:38.618 --> 09:40.662
Thank you for this.

10:10.484 --> 10:11.609
Welcome, everyone,

10:11.609 --> 10:12.777
to tonight's meeting of

10:12.777 --> 10:13.945
the Council of New Eden.

10:13.945 --> 10:15.113
Uh, let the minutes show

10:15.113 --> 10:16.282
that all members are

10:16.282 --> 10:17.157
present, save one.

10:17.157 --> 10:18.450
Yeah, what's Alex

10:18.450 --> 10:19.285
up to tonight?

10:19.285 --> 10:20.453
She was up in the hill

10:20.453 --> 10:21.286
earlier today.

10:21.286 --> 10:22.495
I don't know if she's back.

10:22.495 --> 10:23.788
Checking the relays?

10:23.788 --> 10:24.831
She didn't say.

10:24.831 --> 10:26.626
All right, I move that

10:26.626 --> 10:28.043
we declare Alex's chair

10:28.043 --> 10:29.503
vacant again. Agreed?

10:29.503 --> 10:30.921
Hey, it's her loss.

10:30.921 --> 10:32.047
Agreed.

10:32.047 --> 10:33.214
Right, the main issue on the

10:33.214 --> 10:34.675
docket tonight is the strain on

10:34.675 --> 10:35.843
our already limited resources

10:35.843 --> 10:37.011
should Snowpiercer return.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.720
I just-- I was thinking

10:38.720 --> 10:40.431
that while we have this very

10:40.431 --> 10:41.766
serious discussion about

10:41.766 --> 10:43.475
survival, we live a little?

10:43.475 --> 10:44.935
Ah, come on.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.354
It's been a while.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.564
I defer to the Council Chair.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.025
Oh, fine, Chair agrees.

10:53.985 --> 10:55.363
Ruth, say when.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.863
When. When.

10:56.863 --> 10:58.032
You don't listen!

10:58.032 --> 11:00.200
All right. Yay.

11:00.200 --> 11:01.868
And just for this one hand,

11:01.868 --> 11:03.370
you will indulge me.

11:03.370 --> 11:04.622
Kings wild.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.623
Alright.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.791
Just the way they like it.

11:06.791 --> 11:07.791
Oh.

11:07.791 --> 11:08.959
Keep my business off
Keep my business off
the street, eh?

11:08.959 --> 11:09.834
Keep my business off
the street, eh?

11:38.948 --> 11:40.074
Hey, Mr. Sprinkles.
Hey, Mr. Sprinkles.
You miss me?

11:40.074 --> 11:41.408
Hey, Mr. Sprinkles.
You miss me?

12:09.144 --> 12:10.104
What I'm saying is that

12:10.104 --> 12:11.104
rigging up a geothermal heat

12:11.104 --> 12:12.105
exchanger system for a whole

12:12.105 --> 12:13.107
town is not that simple.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.358
But Snowpiercer's return will

12:14.358 --> 12:15.484
only make it more complicated.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.694
It's more shelters to build,

12:16.694 --> 12:17.945
more mouths to feed,

12:17.945 --> 12:19.280
more energy to generate.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.448
Yeah. But if we can get

12:20.448 --> 12:21.574
geothermal and solar running

12:21.574 --> 12:23.242
20% of the grid by winter,

12:23.242 --> 12:24.285
and then

12:24.285 --> 12:25.578
Big Alice running the rest...

12:25.578 --> 12:27.787
it'll be cold, but we won't

12:27.787 --> 12:29.623
freeze to death, I think.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.041
I see your five.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.167
I raise you ten.

12:32.167 --> 12:33.627
Oh, oh.

12:33.627 --> 12:34.795
He's holding aces.

12:34.795 --> 12:35.838
Snowpiercer comes with

12:35.838 --> 12:37.006
its own resources, too.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.424
It's got more Ag-Sec,

12:38.424 --> 12:39.758
more equipment,

12:39.758 --> 12:40.843
larger workforce.

12:40.843 --> 12:41.844
Yes, but the pocket that

12:41.844 --> 12:42.969
we inhabit is only so large.

12:42.969 --> 12:44.137
Maybe there isn't room
Maybe there isn't room
for both trains.

12:44.137 --> 12:44.930
Maybe there isn't room
for both trains.

12:51.144 --> 12:52.396
Uh, I don't know

12:52.396 --> 12:53.814
if you guys noticed, but Javi

12:53.814 --> 12:54.815
isn't even paying attention.

12:54.815 --> 12:55.815
He's killing us.

12:55.815 --> 12:56.816
I noticed.

12:56.816 --> 12:58.152
He always does. Fold.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.987
Solid choice.

12:59.987 --> 13:02.739
Alright, Mr. Roche.

13:02.739 --> 13:03.907
I call.

13:03.907 --> 13:05.868
Hmm...

13:05.868 --> 13:07.161
Let's see it.

13:07.161 --> 13:08.204
Like that out right there.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.287
No!

13:09.287 --> 13:10.330
Pair of threes.

13:10.330 --> 13:11.581
No way! No!

13:11.581 --> 13:12.708
Threes?

13:12.708 --> 13:13.834
Threes!
Threes!
He came at him with three.

13:13.834 --> 13:14.918
Threes!
He came at him with three.

13:21.466 --> 13:22.634
How?

13:22.634 --> 13:23.927
How do you do it, Mr. Vegas?

13:23.927 --> 13:24.929
It's all magic.

13:24.929 --> 13:25.930
No, boo.

13:25.930 --> 13:26.931
You want the truth?

13:26.931 --> 13:27.931
No, lie to me.

13:27.931 --> 13:29.599
Yes, the truth.

13:29.599 --> 13:31.352
So, when I was kid, I worked

13:31.352 --> 13:32.644
with my cousins at a restaurant

13:32.644 --> 13:33.896
in Montería.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.272
But after work, we'd go in the

13:35.272 --> 13:36.607
back room, play cards all night.

13:36.607 --> 13:37.690
By the time I was 16,

13:37.690 --> 13:38.901
I able to read everyone.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.737
I read their pistas ...

13:41.737 --> 13:42.946
clues.

13:42.946 --> 13:43.948
Read their clues.

13:43.948 --> 13:44.949
You mean "tells?"

13:44.949 --> 13:45.950
Yes, I read your tells.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.536
Okay, what's my pista ?

13:49.536 --> 13:50.995
Your pistas, Layton,

13:50.995 --> 13:53.541
on a good hand, you lean back

13:53.541 --> 13:54.874
on your chair all slow-like.

13:54.874 --> 13:56.001
Super dramatic.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.043
Yeah, he does that.

13:58.878 --> 14:00.256
What about Mister Roche here?

14:00.256 --> 14:01.464
Mr. Roche, you check

14:01.464 --> 14:02.966
your hole cards twice.

14:02.966 --> 14:04.051
Just to make sure.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.719
Yeah. And you, Josie,

14:05.719 --> 14:06.887
you play with your hair.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.055
Exactly like that.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.056
Ruth.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.181
Ruth, you're the easiest.

14:10.181 --> 14:11.474
On a bad hand,

14:11.474 --> 14:13.518
your left eyebrow will go up.

14:13.518 --> 14:14.644
You're raising it.

14:14.644 --> 14:15.646
Just her left.

14:15.646 --> 14:16.647
I'm gonna start watching.

14:16.647 --> 14:17.647
I told you this.

14:17.647 --> 14:18.648
I can't play with you guys

14:18.648 --> 14:19.691
anymore.

14:19.691 --> 14:20.692
Oh, what happened?

14:23.903 --> 14:25.113
Oh, if Ag-Sec lost power--

14:25.113 --> 14:26.156
Yeah, I'm on it.

14:29.450 --> 14:30.411
I'll count your chips

14:30.411 --> 14:31.328
for you.

15:10.408 --> 15:11.535
You gotta...

15:37.060 --> 15:38.144
If this is some kind of joke,

15:38.144 --> 15:39.104
it's not funny.

16:08.758 --> 16:09.759
You feel that?

16:09.759 --> 16:11.762
Mm-hmm.

16:11.762 --> 16:12.762
Maybe.

16:12.762 --> 16:13.763
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, alright.

16:13.763 --> 16:14.931
Oh.
Oh, alright.

16:19.686 --> 16:21.437
Yeah, well, I think

16:21.437 --> 16:22.564
Dr. Headwood's treatments

16:22.564 --> 16:24.065
are working quite well.
are working quite well.
Yeah?

16:24.065 --> 16:25.066
are working quite well.
Yeah?

16:29.153 --> 16:30.280
Oh.

16:32.782 --> 16:33.700
Oh, how about
Oh, how about
we kill the lights?

16:33.700 --> 16:34.743
Oh, how about
we kill the lights?

16:42.084 --> 16:43.502
Javi thinks it was an

16:43.502 --> 16:44.711
accident, but who goes

16:44.711 --> 16:45.921
fumbling around the back

16:45.921 --> 16:47.171
of town hall and trips

16:47.171 --> 16:48.339
over a power cable?

16:48.339 --> 16:49.340
You want to talk

16:49.340 --> 16:50.341
about this now?

16:50.341 --> 16:51.510
Not everyone loves the idea

16:51.510 --> 16:52.511
of Snowpiercer coming back.

16:52.511 --> 16:53.512
What if somebody's trying

16:53.512 --> 16:54.512
to send us a message?

16:54.512 --> 16:55.513
Then somebody's gonna

16:55.513 --> 16:56.682
have to get over it.

16:56.682 --> 16:57.849
Come on.

16:57.849 --> 16:59.059
It's not about the train,

16:59.059 --> 17:00.560
it's about the people.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.396
Every day I wonder about Miles.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.022
How tall he's gotten.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.357
Where he is.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.734
Ben, Till...

17:07.734 --> 17:10.236
Melanie not so much.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.241
Come here.

17:18.912 --> 17:20.164
How long have those power

17:20.164 --> 17:21.415
relays been giving you

17:21.415 --> 17:22.582
and Javi problems?

17:23.958 --> 17:25.668
You can go talk to Javi about

17:25.668 --> 17:26.919
that, right now or we can

17:26.919 --> 17:28.464
stay here and get naked.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.839
Yeah, that's my bad.

17:29.839 --> 17:31.007
I don't know what

17:31.007 --> 17:32.009
I was thinking.
I was thinking.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.010
I was thinking.

17:54.322 --> 17:56.157
New Eden to Snowpiercer.
New Eden to Snowpiercer.
Do you copy?

17:56.157 --> 17:57.158
New Eden to Snowpiercer.
Do you copy?

17:59.912 --> 18:02.164
Snowpiercer, do you copy?

18:05.416 --> 18:07.168
Come on, come on.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.176
Mel, this is Javi.

18:18.429 --> 18:20.182
Ben, do you copy?

18:40.868 --> 18:42.162
Can you take a step?

18:42.162 --> 18:43.746
Can you take a step for Daddy?

18:46.875 --> 18:48.627
One step for Daddy.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.503
No? would you do it for Gibby?

18:50.503 --> 18:52.714
One step for Gibby.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.715
Don't worry, it'll happen.

18:54.715 --> 18:56.717
Hello, Miss.

18:56.717 --> 18:58.011
Oh, I don't know why

18:58.011 --> 18:59.471
I'm trying so hard.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.764
One day she's taking her first

19:01.764 --> 19:03.058
steps, the next day she's

19:03.058 --> 19:04.350
walking right out that door

19:04.350 --> 19:06.102
in that scary world.

19:06.102 --> 19:07.271
will you stop it?

19:07.271 --> 19:08.688
Whatever comes, Liana

19:08.688 --> 19:10.064
will be ready.

19:10.064 --> 19:11.692
She's a fighter.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.901
Mm-hmm, just like her mother.

19:13.901 --> 19:16.155
Just like her father.

19:20.658 --> 19:22.953
Hey, I patched Oz up after

19:22.953 --> 19:24.620
that tussle he had with Boki.

19:24.620 --> 19:26.165
I heard you were the one

19:26.165 --> 19:27.541
who broke it up.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.586
Yeah, Oz... has got issues.

19:30.586 --> 19:31.712
Ha!

19:31.712 --> 19:33.129
What made him leave town and

19:33.129 --> 19:34.548
move up on the mountain?

19:34.548 --> 19:35.924
He didn't tell me.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.885
But every day he's up there,

19:37.885 --> 19:39.636
the weirder he gets.

19:39.636 --> 19:41.597
Yeah, I think you're right.

19:41.597 --> 19:44.474
We're gonna try it again.

19:44.474 --> 19:45.474
Ready?

19:45.474 --> 19:46.726
Give me your hand, come on.

19:46.726 --> 19:48.060
Can you...?

19:48.060 --> 19:50.062
Oh, oh! That was a step!

19:50.062 --> 19:52.733
That was a step! You genius.

19:52.733 --> 19:53.900
You did it, baby.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.068
She walked. You saw it.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.654
I saw it. I admit it.

20:25.098 --> 20:26.058
Who's there?

20:30.937 --> 20:32.063
Show yourself.

20:52.166 --> 20:53.292
Hey.

20:53.292 --> 20:54.878
Did you hear that radio call?

20:54.878 --> 20:55.963
Sounded to me like it got

20:55.963 --> 20:56.964
cut off.

20:56.964 --> 20:57.964
Josie went out to check

20:57.964 --> 20:58.799
the relay--

20:58.799 --> 20:59.800
Javi, I'm busy right now.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.134
I can't talk, actually.

21:02.468 --> 21:04.303
It's Snowpiercer.

21:04.303 --> 21:05.680
I think they just tried to make

21:05.680 --> 21:07.139
contact for the first time

21:07.139 --> 21:08.724
in a year.

21:10.851 --> 21:13.437
Look, Alex, I know you've got

21:13.437 --> 21:15.482
your own thing going on...

21:15.482 --> 21:17.484
but you're on the Council and

21:17.484 --> 21:19.860
we have a lot of responsibility.

21:19.860 --> 21:21.362
Comms, power, water,

21:21.362 --> 21:22.531
you name it.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.657
Yeah, I was running Big Alice

21:23.657 --> 21:24.907
when I was nine, so...

21:24.907 --> 21:26.493
And you're a genius.

21:26.493 --> 21:27.828
I know that.

21:27.828 --> 21:29.120
We all know that.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.830
The fact that you figured out

21:30.830 --> 21:32.165
how Big Alice could generate

21:32.165 --> 21:33.541
power in low-idle is, like--

21:33.541 --> 21:35.085
Nobel Prize winning stuff.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.544
I was going to say,

21:36.544 --> 21:38.254
"impressive," but okay.

21:38.254 --> 21:40.173
The thing is, Snowpiercer is

21:40.173 --> 21:43.342
coming into comms range.

21:43.342 --> 21:46.012
It could be already.

21:46.012 --> 21:49.515
And that includes your mother.

21:49.515 --> 21:51.643
Out of all people, don't you

21:51.643 --> 21:53.310
want to reach her?

21:53.310 --> 21:55.938
Javi, stick to the science.

21:55.938 --> 21:57.232
Stay away from the personal.

21:57.232 --> 21:58.358
You're not very good
You're not very good
at it, okay?

21:58.358 --> 21:59.318
You're not very good
at it, okay?

22:08.993 --> 22:10.870
Layton.

22:10.870 --> 22:11.913
Josie!

22:18.211 --> 22:19.463
Javi thinks he just heard

22:19.463 --> 22:20.504
Snowpiercer on the comms

22:20.504 --> 22:21.964
but the signal dropped out.

22:21.964 --> 22:23.175
But I mean if they're

22:23.175 --> 22:24.216
in communications range,

22:24.216 --> 22:25.092
that means they're closing in

22:25.092 --> 22:25.968
on the track switch.

22:25.968 --> 22:26.970
Well ahead of schedule.

22:26.970 --> 22:27.971
But the bridge isn't

22:27.971 --> 22:28.972
done yet.

22:28.972 --> 22:29.973
If Snowpiercer's that close--

22:29.973 --> 22:31.015
Oly, look, we need to

22:31.015 --> 22:32.016
fix the relays first.

22:32.016 --> 22:32.893
They can't come if they

22:32.893 --> 22:33.726
don't know we exist.

22:33.726 --> 22:34.727
Do you think you can

22:34.727 --> 22:35.603
get up there, Josie?

22:35.603 --> 22:36.605
See if that relay is the

22:36.605 --> 22:37.606
reason we the loss of signal.

22:37.606 --> 22:39.273
Yeah, I'll go and suit up.

22:41.568 --> 22:42.610
The other relay, though, it's

22:42.610 --> 22:44.862
six or seven hour trek away--

22:44.862 --> 22:45.864
Yeah.

22:45.864 --> 22:46.990
I'll get Boki.

22:47.866 --> 22:48.867
I'm on my way.

22:51.118 --> 22:52.913
Hi, guys.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.622
Hey, Z!

22:54.622 --> 22:56.375
Yo.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.751
Have you seen Boki?

22:57.751 --> 22:59.002
He never showed up

22:59.002 --> 23:00.003
this morning.
this morning.
Hey, neither did Oz.

23:00.003 --> 23:02.464
this morning.
Hey, neither did Oz.

23:13.265 --> 23:14.100
Oh, hey.

23:14.100 --> 23:15.101
What did we say about

23:15.101 --> 23:15.976
ripping those stitches?

23:18.647 --> 23:20.147
You need to come by the clinic

23:20.147 --> 23:21.148
and get them redone.

23:21.148 --> 23:22.274
Okay?

23:22.274 --> 23:23.651
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll try.

23:23.651 --> 23:24.485
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'll try.

23:49.636 --> 23:50.470
Hey, excuse me.

23:50.470 --> 23:51.387
Can I get your attention

23:51.387 --> 23:52.304
for minute?

23:52.304 --> 23:54.265
I'm looking for Boki.

23:54.265 --> 23:55.516
Anybody seen him?

23:55.516 --> 23:56.475
Nope.

23:56.475 --> 23:57.435
Big guy.

23:57.435 --> 23:58.310
Yeah.

23:58.310 --> 23:59.771
I saw him coming out of

23:59.771 --> 24:00.772
the engine earlier.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.398
He was up at Big Alice?

24:02.398 --> 24:03.233
Yeah.

24:03.233 --> 24:04.568
He had a small crate with him.

24:04.568 --> 24:05.401
Looked like he was heading

24:05.401 --> 24:06.235
up into the hills.

24:06.235 --> 24:08.320
Thanks, Lights.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.697
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

24:09.697 --> 24:13.326
Mm-hmm.

24:40.186 --> 24:41.730
Oh wow.

24:41.855 --> 24:44.858
Yeah.

24:44.858 --> 24:46.650
Could the rug have fall off

24:46.650 --> 24:47.651
a cliff or something?

24:47.651 --> 24:48.695
Uh, even with the winds

24:48.695 --> 24:49.695
the way they've been,

24:49.695 --> 24:50.696
I doubt it.

24:50.696 --> 24:52.282
But this is why we lost the

24:52.282 --> 24:53.282
signal this morning.

24:53.282 --> 24:55.243
Power issues,

24:55.243 --> 24:56.953
broken relays.

24:56.953 --> 24:58.330
Did you ever find Boki?

24:58.330 --> 24:59.330
I heard he was up

24:59.330 --> 25:00.290
at the Engine today.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.332
Javi, Alex say anything to you

25:01.332 --> 25:02.333
about it?

25:02.333 --> 25:03.710
No.

25:03.710 --> 25:04.711
She talks to Mr. Sprinkles

25:04.711 --> 25:05.878
more than she does to me.

25:05.878 --> 25:07.630
I'm sorry, Mr. Sprinkles.

25:07.630 --> 25:09.089
Her pet bird.

25:09.089 --> 25:10.466
She's using him to get some

25:10.466 --> 25:11.467
climate data.

25:11.467 --> 25:13.512
Does she keep him in a little

25:13.512 --> 25:14.512
box?

25:14.512 --> 25:15.804
Yeah, usually. Why?

25:15.804 --> 25:17.389
No, just something

25:17.389 --> 25:18.390
Lights said.

25:18.390 --> 25:19.475
Boki is not our guy.

25:19.475 --> 25:21.394
Hey, uh, I think this

25:21.394 --> 25:22.395
was sabotage.

25:22.395 --> 25:23.480
Things can't have gotten

25:23.480 --> 25:24.313
that bad.

25:24.313 --> 25:25.314
You said it yourself,

25:25.314 --> 25:26.148
the town's been grumbling.

25:26.148 --> 25:27.609
We need to address this

25:27.609 --> 25:29.151
tonight at town hall and maybe

25:29.151 --> 25:30.153
discuss stepping up security

25:30.153 --> 25:31.487
with Mr. Roche.

25:31.487 --> 25:33.072
Javi, can you and Josie either

25:33.072 --> 25:34.407
repair or replace this relay and

25:34.407 --> 25:35.449
get it back on hillside?

25:35.449 --> 25:37.910
It'll be tight, but--

25:37.910 --> 25:38.994
Excellent, thank you.
Excellent, thank you.
Andre, can I have a minute?

25:38.994 --> 25:40.413
Excellent, thank you.
Andre, can I have a minute?

25:46.293 --> 25:47.294
Okay, thank you, Sean.

25:47.294 --> 25:50.506
Uh, Zarah, sorry but I have

25:50.506 --> 25:51.675
to step out for a bit.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.092
Sure.

25:53.092 --> 25:54.970
Will you be back this afternoon?

25:54.970 --> 25:56.221
Yes.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.639
Uh, I-- Boki needs another

25:58.639 --> 25:59.640
skin treatment.

25:59.640 --> 26:03.144
Uh, I'll be back after that.

26:03.144 --> 26:04.396
Okay.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.772
Oz was supposed to stop by and

26:05.772 --> 26:06.939
get his stitches redone, but he

26:06.939 --> 26:08.108
never came, so I going to

26:08.108 --> 26:09.275
head up to see him later.
head up to see him later.
You're a kind soul.

26:09.275 --> 26:12.028
head up to see him later.
You're a kind soul.

26:30.504 --> 26:32.048
This is not the normal

26:32.173 --> 26:33.132
town drama.

26:33.132 --> 26:34.134
There's something else

26:34.134 --> 26:35.135
goin' on.

26:35.135 --> 26:35.968
And you really think

26:35.968 --> 26:36.802
it's related to Snowpiercer

26:36.802 --> 26:37.637
coming back?

26:37.637 --> 26:39.179
Maybe.

26:39.179 --> 26:40.055
I don't know.

26:40.055 --> 26:42.474
We voted to fix the bridge

26:42.474 --> 26:44.810
a long time ago so why

26:44.810 --> 26:46.021
fight it now?
fight it now?
Devil's advocate?

26:46.021 --> 26:47.438
fight it now?
Devil's advocate?

26:52.569 --> 26:56.114
Resentment is a powerful thing.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.992
The feeling is that we risked

26:58.992 --> 27:00.493
everything coming here.

27:00.493 --> 27:01.493
Snowpiercer didn't.

27:01.493 --> 27:03.871
They chose to move on.

27:03.871 --> 27:05.581
So why should they share the

27:05.581 --> 27:07.333
reward, when we took all the

27:07.333 --> 27:08.335
risk?
risk?
Let them live with their choice.

27:08.335 --> 27:11.338
risk?
Let them live with their choice.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.509
That's the "devil's advocate"

27:16.509 --> 27:17.886
talking, or Ruth Wardell?

27:17.886 --> 27:21.013
We both have friends on that

27:21.013 --> 27:22.014
train.
train.
Friends we'd like to see again.

27:22.014 --> 27:24.224
train.
Friends we'd like to see again.

27:26.727 --> 27:28.146
Yeah.

27:29.897 --> 27:30.857
Right.

27:30.857 --> 27:32.692
Well, my opinion?

27:32.692 --> 27:34.360
It's not a protest.

27:34.360 --> 27:35.235
Protestors want to be heard

27:35.235 --> 27:36.154
and seen.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.030
This is different.

27:37.030 --> 27:37.989
This is more like they're

27:37.989 --> 27:38.907
testing us to see how

27:38.907 --> 27:39.823
we're going to respond.

27:39.823 --> 27:43.369
The question is, what next?

27:43.369 --> 27:44.370
Ohh.

27:44.370 --> 27:47.165
Times like these, I bet you

27:47.165 --> 27:49.000
really regret stepping down.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.710
Not even a little bit.

27:50.710 --> 27:53.588
Getting to spend all this time

27:53.588 --> 27:54.589
with Liana.

27:54.589 --> 27:56.424
Wouldn't change it for

27:56.424 --> 27:57.425
the world.

27:57.425 --> 27:59.843
I am a changed man, Ruth.

27:59.843 --> 28:01.096
And if the town needs its

28:01.096 --> 28:02.137
"wartime" general back at?
"wartime" general back at?
They already have theirs.

28:02.137 --> 28:03.973
"wartime" general back at?
They already have theirs.

28:06.309 --> 28:08.520
The people elected you, Ruth.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.978
And there's not a better person
And there's not a better person
to lead them right now.

28:09.978 --> 28:11.022
And there's not a better person
to lead them right now.

28:17.361 --> 28:18.405
Alright, I'm gonna go talk

28:18.405 --> 28:20.072
to Alex and see if she can
to Alex and see if she can
tell us where Boki's at.

28:20.072 --> 28:21.032
to Alex and see if she can
tell us where Boki's at.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.387
Hi, Sam.

28:42.512 --> 28:43.929
Hey.

28:43.929 --> 28:44.930
What?

28:44.930 --> 28:45.889
Sorry, I'm on patrol.

28:45.889 --> 28:46.849
just checking in.

28:46.849 --> 28:47.766
Did I wake Liana?

28:47.766 --> 28:48.768
It's okay, I was about

28:48.768 --> 28:49.769
to wake her anyway.

28:49.769 --> 28:50.936
You know rule six of being

28:50.936 --> 28:51.896
a parent is never wake

28:51.896 --> 28:52.772
a sleeping kid.

28:52.772 --> 28:53.772
Yeah, but I gotta go

28:53.772 --> 28:54.773
up the mountain to see Oz.

28:54.773 --> 28:56.443
I have to drop her with Andre.

28:56.443 --> 28:57.444
No, no, let her sleep,

28:57.444 --> 28:58.278
I'll watch her.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.779
Uh...

28:59.779 --> 29:00.612
it's okay.

29:00.612 --> 29:01.447
Don't worry about it.

29:01.447 --> 29:02.282
I'd be thrilled.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.282
You know how much I miss

29:03.282 --> 29:04.117
stage with Carly,

29:04.117 --> 29:06.285
before back tattoos became the

29:06.285 --> 29:07.619
topic of conversation?

29:07.619 --> 29:09.496
You sure?

29:09.496 --> 29:10.581
I won't be gone long.

29:10.581 --> 29:11.624
Please, let me watch her.

29:11.624 --> 29:12.458
Go.

29:12.458 --> 29:13.333
Okay, see ya.
Okay, see ya.
Alright, see ya.

29:13.333 --> 29:14.335
Okay, see ya.
Alright, see ya.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.177
Hello.

29:23.177 --> 29:24.428
Hey.

29:24.428 --> 29:26.263
Missed you at the meeting

29:26.263 --> 29:27.264
last night.

29:27.264 --> 29:29.725
And the last three before that.

29:29.725 --> 29:31.310
I don't have time to play

29:31.310 --> 29:32.395
card games with you guys

29:32.395 --> 29:33.396
right now.

29:33.396 --> 29:35.063
Ouch.

29:35.063 --> 29:35.982
Officially offended.

29:35.982 --> 29:37.442
I'm just busy.

29:37.442 --> 29:39.151
Melanie always said, "Big minds

29:39.151 --> 29:40.570
should solve big problems."

29:40.570 --> 29:42.946
So your pet bird qualifies

29:42.946 --> 29:44.907
as a big problem now?

29:44.907 --> 29:46.826
First off all, calling

29:46.826 --> 29:48.787
Mr. Sprinkles is a dedicated

29:48.787 --> 29:49.704
scientific collaborator.

29:49.704 --> 29:50.996
Second of all, how do you about

29:50.996 --> 29:51.915
him?

29:51.915 --> 29:52.749
Saw Boki?

29:52.749 --> 29:53.625
No. I wish.

29:53.625 --> 29:54.958
We could've used him today to go

29:54.958 --> 29:56.336
check on the far relay, but you

29:56.336 --> 29:57.337
sent him on an errand.

29:57.337 --> 30:00.506
So... when will he be back?

30:00.506 --> 30:01.925
Later tonight.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.635
Also, it's not an "errand."

30:03.635 --> 30:05.345
He's going to the edge of the

30:05.345 --> 30:06.762
pocket to get me data on

30:06.762 --> 30:07.763
magnetic fields, barometric

30:07.763 --> 30:08.764
pressure, seismographic readings

30:08.764 --> 30:11.099
I have no idea what you're
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

30:11.099 --> 30:11.935
I have no idea what you're
talking about.

30:14.186 --> 30:15.312
We're having earthquakes?

30:15.312 --> 30:17.232
We've been having them.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.233
They're small and they're

30:18.233 --> 30:19.484
sporadic, but they're real and

30:19.484 --> 30:20.484
they're concerning.

30:20.484 --> 30:22.403
I'm trying to figure out if

30:22.403 --> 30:23.695
the atmospheric erosion is
the atmospheric erosion is
a corollary of the quakes.

30:23.695 --> 30:25.156
the atmospheric erosion is
a corollary of the quakes.

30:28.076 --> 30:28.952
There's something

30:28.952 --> 30:29.868
that missing in the field.

30:29.868 --> 30:30.703
There's something that
There's something that
doesn't make sense.

30:30.703 --> 30:31.370
There's something that
doesn't make sense.

30:33.580 --> 30:35.250
Yeah, there's a lot of that
Yeah, there's a lot of that
going on.

30:35.250 --> 30:36.083
Yeah, there's a lot of that
going on.

32:09.135 --> 32:10.427
Audrey!

32:12.638 --> 32:14.432
Audrey!

32:14.557 --> 32:16.141
What happened to you?
What happened to you?
They're coming.

32:16.141 --> 32:17.476
What happened to you?
They're coming.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.356
Audrey!

32:38.997 --> 32:40.666
Oz, it's me!

32:40.666 --> 32:42.292
It's just me.

32:42.292 --> 32:44.712
Sorry.

32:44.712 --> 32:45.588
You need to get inside

32:45.588 --> 32:46.464
What's wrong?

32:46.464 --> 32:47.674
Sorry, I just thought

32:47.674 --> 32:48.675
you were someone else.

32:48.675 --> 32:51.343
Who?

32:51.343 --> 32:53.637
You wouldn't believe me if
You wouldn't believe me if
I told you.

32:53.637 --> 32:54.597
You wouldn't believe me if
I told you.

32:58.141 --> 32:58.893
Those are a mess.
Those are a mess.
We need to take care of them.

32:58.893 --> 33:00.477
Those are a mess.
We need to take care of them.

33:03.731 --> 33:04.816
You came all the way
You came all the way
up here just for me?

33:04.816 --> 33:05.649
You came all the way
up here just for me?

33:09.028 --> 33:10.362
What?

33:10.362 --> 33:12.407
Why would you do that?

33:12.407 --> 33:14.324
Maybe because...

33:14.324 --> 33:17.160
I know what it's like to be

33:17.160 --> 33:18.162
an outsider.
an outsider.
To be constantly misjudged.

33:18.162 --> 33:21.165
an outsider.
To be constantly misjudged.

33:25.043 --> 33:26.963
I know what it feels like to be

33:26.963 --> 33:28.214
so consumed by fear and

33:28.214 --> 33:30.550
basic survival that you forget

33:30.550 --> 33:31.676
what you're supposed to be
what you're supposed to be
living for.

33:31.676 --> 33:32.510
what you're supposed to be
living for.

33:36.179 --> 33:37.724
I can't live down there

33:37.724 --> 33:38.808
on that bloody train.

33:38.808 --> 33:40.976
No one's asking you to.

33:40.976 --> 33:43.980
Just tell me what happened.

33:43.980 --> 33:46.064
We stopped moving.

33:46.064 --> 33:46.941
That's a good thing,

33:46.941 --> 33:47.817
isn't it?

33:47.817 --> 33:48.818
When you stop moving,

33:48.818 --> 33:49.819
the past catches up and piles

33:49.819 --> 33:50.820
on top of you.

33:50.820 --> 33:54.072
So climb out from under it.

33:54.072 --> 33:55.824
Ah.
Ah.
Sorry.

33:55.824 --> 33:56.659
Ah.
Sorry.

33:58.619 --> 33:59.746
When we're done here,

33:59.746 --> 34:00.580
come with me.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.663
People are gathering at the

34:01.663 --> 34:02.998
town hall tonight to talk about

34:02.998 --> 34:03.833
Snowpiercer's return--

34:03.833 --> 34:04.916
They're not coming back,
They're not coming back, ever.

34:04.916 --> 34:05.752
They're not coming back, ever.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.049
Snowpiercer's gone.

34:14.802 --> 34:15.969
They're all dead.

34:23.686 --> 34:26.230
Alright, thanks everyone,

34:26.230 --> 34:27.565
thank you all for coming.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.484
I know you all have questions.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.442
Questions about some

34:30.442 --> 34:31.277
recent events.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.612
But before taking those

34:32.612 --> 34:34.279
questions, I'd like to take

34:34.279 --> 34:35.614
a moment to express

34:35.614 --> 34:36.616
the Council's gratitude

34:36.616 --> 34:38.284
for your tireless efforts

34:38.284 --> 34:40.286
to complete the trestle bridge.

34:40.286 --> 34:41.119
Really, congratulations
Really, congratulations
on a job well done.

34:41.119 --> 34:43.038
Really, congratulations
on a job well done.

34:48.960 --> 34:50.128
It's been a long time

34:50.128 --> 34:51.297
since we've seen our friends
since we've seen our friends
on Snowpiercer, hasn't it?

34:51.297 --> 34:52.130
since we've seen our friends
on Snowpiercer, hasn't it?

34:53.632 --> 34:54.467
Well, the day is fast

34:54.467 --> 34:55.634
approaching when we get to see

34:55.634 --> 34:56.469
them again.

34:56.469 --> 34:58.261
To reunite, hug our friends, and

34:58.261 --> 35:00.348
show them that the risks we took
show them that the risks we took
coming here were worth it.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.681
show them that the risks we took
coming here were worth it.

35:05.311 --> 35:06.353
John, you're not making

35:06.353 --> 35:07.188
sense, what voices?

35:07.188 --> 35:08.563
First they were just these

35:08.563 --> 35:09.898
whispers in the wind in the

35:09.898 --> 35:11.484
middle of the night, but if you

35:11.484 --> 35:12.652
listen, you can hear them--

35:12.652 --> 35:13.485
Sound carries in the

35:13.485 --> 35:14.319
mountains, and the drinking

35:14.319 --> 35:15.154
doesn't help--

35:15.154 --> 35:16.154
No, no. It's not that!

35:16.154 --> 35:16.989
I'm not drunk,

35:16.989 --> 35:17.824
and I'm not crazy.

35:17.824 --> 35:19.324
I was married to a psychopath

35:19.324 --> 35:20.618
so I know what crazy

35:20.618 --> 35:21.911
sounds like, that's not this.

35:21.911 --> 35:23.161
Please, just calm down.

35:23.161 --> 35:24.496
Something happened on that

35:24.496 --> 35:25.331
train, something awful.

35:25.331 --> 35:26.248
And I know who's

35:26.248 --> 35:27.458
responsible for all of it.

35:27.458 --> 35:29.000
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
Who?

35:29.000 --> 35:29.793
What are you talking about?
Who?

35:32.964 --> 35:35.215
It's LJ.

35:35.215 --> 35:36.676
She won't--

35:36.676 --> 35:38.594
she won't leave me alone.
she won't leave me alone.
Come on, come with me...

35:38.594 --> 35:39.469
she won't leave me alone.
Come on, come with me...

35:47.061 --> 35:48.186
Now.
Now.
Just listen...

35:48.186 --> 35:49.438
Now.
Just listen...

35:57.279 --> 35:59.239
Oz...

35:59.239 --> 36:00.866
I know how destructive LJ was--

36:00.866 --> 36:01.701
Please--
Please--
just please just be quiet--

36:01.701 --> 36:02.493
Please--
just please just be quiet--

36:05.036 --> 36:05.871
If Snowpiercer

36:05.871 --> 36:06.956
returns, you don't have to

36:06.956 --> 36:07.790
deal with--

36:07.790 --> 36:08.875
They're not returning,

36:08.875 --> 36:09.750
I just told you.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.335
Oz, I'm trying to help

36:11.335 --> 36:12.420
you, but you need to--

36:12.420 --> 36:13.753
No, you listen! Just listen!

36:13.753 --> 36:14.630
All is not forgiven--

36:14.630 --> 36:15.505
we're just as guilty

36:15.505 --> 36:16.840
as they are-- all of us.

36:16.840 --> 36:17.717
They're already here, they're

36:17.717 --> 36:18.592
haunting this place because

36:18.592 --> 36:19.677
we made it and they didn't.

36:19.677 --> 36:20.511
I'm sorry,
I'm sorry,
I have to go.

36:20.511 --> 36:21.344
I'm sorry,
I have to go.

36:23.306 --> 36:24.223
Sorry.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.891
Can you just wait?
Can you just wait?
Zarah!

36:25.891 --> 36:26.851
Can you just wait?
Zarah!

36:29.311 --> 36:30.353
Zarah!

36:39.237 --> 36:40.572
I see you brought

36:40.572 --> 36:41.406
the aloha gear.

36:41.406 --> 36:42.824
Tried to give Ruth a smile

36:42.824 --> 36:43.659
tonight.

36:43.659 --> 36:45.076
It's good, I kind of missed

36:45.076 --> 36:45.911
the old "Aloha Javi."

36:45.911 --> 36:47.078
He knew how to have fun.

36:47.078 --> 36:49.415
Well, so did Alex.

36:49.415 --> 36:50.333
Did I?

36:50.333 --> 36:52.125
Hey, we need some help here.

36:52.125 --> 36:53.043
Can somebody make some room?

36:53.043 --> 36:53.877
We need help.

36:53.877 --> 36:54.712
I got you.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.632
Zarah?

36:58.632 --> 36:59.967
Dr. Headwood?

36:59.967 --> 37:00.801
Is that...

37:00.801 --> 37:01.636
Yeah, it's Audrey.

37:01.636 --> 37:02.802
She showed up on a track scaler,

37:02.802 --> 37:03.637
she's in really bad shape.

37:03.637 --> 37:04.639
Everybody, we need the room,

37:04.639 --> 37:05.473
please.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.848
Go get her some water.

37:06.848 --> 37:08.016
Quick as you can.

37:08.016 --> 37:08.935
What happened

37:08.935 --> 37:09.768
to her skin?

37:09.768 --> 37:10.645
I don't know.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.811
She showed up like this.

37:11.811 --> 37:13.022
She said someone was coming.

37:13.022 --> 37:13.855
Audrey?

37:13.855 --> 37:14.773
Dr. Headwood?

37:14.773 --> 37:15.607
Audrey?

37:17.860 --> 37:19.027
Oh, not this again.

37:19.027 --> 37:19.987
I thought you

37:19.987 --> 37:20.820
fixed the cable.

37:20.820 --> 37:21.656
I did!

37:21.656 --> 37:22.489
Javi, Alex,

37:22.489 --> 37:24.366
get the power back on.

37:24.366 --> 37:25.368
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

37:25.368 --> 37:27.869
The power, the relays,

37:27.869 --> 37:29.163
someone is not coming.

37:29.163 --> 37:30.581
They're already here.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.540
They've been here.

37:32.540 --> 37:33.500
Who?

37:33.500 --> 37:34.502
Where is Zarah?

37:34.502 --> 37:35.335
Why isn't she--

37:35.335 --> 37:36.628
I need to find Liana.

37:36.628 --> 37:37.587
Out of the way!

37:37.587 --> 37:39.340
Audrey?
Audrey?
Excuse me, excuse me.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.299
Audrey?
Excuse me, excuse me.

37:43.927 --> 37:47.139
Can you say Roche?

37:47.139 --> 37:49.641
Yes. Hello. Can you say Roche?

37:49.641 --> 37:50.935
Yes.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.853
Hey, Doc Headwood, how you been?

37:52.853 --> 37:54.397
Dr. Headwood: Good evening.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.648
Oh, don't worry, Doc.

37:55.648 --> 37:56.482
Everything's gonna be okay.

37:56.482 --> 37:57.525
Probably just a loose cable...

37:59.819 --> 38:02.404
Dr. Headwood: I'm very sorry,

38:02.404 --> 38:03.239
Mr. Roche.

38:03.239 --> 38:04.572
Layton! Layton!

38:04.572 --> 38:05.866
Hey. Yeah?

38:05.866 --> 38:06.909
I just saw--

38:06.909 --> 38:07.743
Yeah,

38:07.743 --> 38:08.744
the track scaler, I know.

38:08.744 --> 38:09.578
Miss Audrey was inside.

38:09.578 --> 38:10.413
What?

38:10.413 --> 38:11.246
Yeah,

38:11.246 --> 38:12.081
she's in bad shape.

38:12.081 --> 38:13.498
I took her up to town hall,

38:13.498 --> 38:14.500
but she needs a doctor.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.500
Miss Audrey, the stock,

38:15.500 --> 38:16.502
one thing at a time.

38:16.502 --> 38:17.712
I didn't see a track scaler,

38:17.712 --> 38:18.545
I saw a snowcat.

38:18.545 --> 38:19.672
What?

38:19.672 --> 38:21.924
Yes, on the other side of the

38:21.924 --> 38:23.342
mountain, it was a transport

38:23.342 --> 38:24.176
or something.

38:24.176 --> 38:25.886
We haven't got one of those.
We haven't got one of those.
Neither does Snowpiercer.

38:25.886 --> 38:26.971
We haven't got one of those.
Neither does Snowpiercer.

38:33.393 --> 38:34.436
Zarah! Where are you?

38:37.023 --> 38:38.357
Zarah!

38:38.357 --> 38:39.275
Layton?

38:41.067 --> 38:43.194
Oh-- Hey, hey!

38:43.194 --> 38:44.822
Sam!

38:44.822 --> 38:46.364
Sam, come on, buddy.
Sam, come on, buddy.
He's got a pulse.

38:46.364 --> 38:47.491
Sam, come on, buddy.
He's got a pulse.

39:07.511 --> 39:08.511
Liana?

39:11.306 --> 39:14.018
Liana?
Liana?

39:14.018 --> 39:15.518
Liana?

39:19.898 --> 39:21.107
Dr. Headwood?
Dr. Headwood?
Dr. Headwood: Zarah.

39:21.107 --> 39:22.067
Dr. Headwood?
Dr. Headwood: Zarah.

39:25.237 --> 39:26.237
Who is that with you?

39:26.237 --> 39:27.739
Remain calm, everything's

39:27.739 --> 39:29.241
going to be alright.

39:29.241 --> 39:30.826
Give me my daughter.

39:30.826 --> 39:32.036
Dr. Headwood: Zarah! Stop!

39:32.036 --> 39:33.953
He is a friend, Zarah.

39:33.953 --> 39:35.790
He's a friend.

39:35.790 --> 39:37.708
Give me my daughter.

39:37.708 --> 39:38.625
Now!

39:38.625 --> 39:39.752
Dr. Headwood: Don't fight!

39:39.752 --> 39:40.920
Zarah, don't fight with him.

39:40.920 --> 39:43.005
Get off of me.

39:43.005 --> 39:43.964
Please, I'm trying

39:43.964 --> 39:44.924
to help you. Zarah!

39:44.924 --> 39:45.924
Don't fight with him.

39:45.924 --> 39:46.926
Give me my child.

39:46.926 --> 39:47.927
Dr. Headwood: Stop fighting
Dr. Headwood: Stop fighting
with him, please.

39:47.927 --> 39:48.886
Dr. Headwood: Stop fighting
with him, please.

39:53.766 --> 39:54.933
We stemmed the

39:54.933 --> 39:56.518
bleeding, but he never woke up.

39:56.518 --> 39:57.353
He needs help.

39:57.353 --> 39:59.188
How the hell did this

39:59.188 --> 40:00.022
happen, Andre?

40:00.022 --> 40:01.315
Just get a nurse.

40:01.315 --> 40:02.357
Go to the clinic.

40:02.357 --> 40:03.442
I'm gonna round up volunteers

40:03.442 --> 40:04.360
to search the hills,

40:04.360 --> 40:05.235
Josie's already up there.

40:05.235 --> 40:06.404
I need everybody, Ruth,
I need everybody, Ruth, everybody.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.237
I need everybody, Ruth, everybody.

40:37.308 --> 40:38.853
Zarah!

40:47.027 --> 40:48.069
Who is that?

40:50.239 --> 40:51.699
It's Bojan Boscovic.

40:51.699 --> 40:52.991
You must come with me.

40:52.991 --> 40:54.159
Please.
Please.
Hurry!

40:54.159 --> 40:54.994
Please.
Hurry!

41:08.840 --> 41:10.676
It's her back.

41:10.676 --> 41:15.096
I did not want to move her.

41:15.096 --> 41:16.556
Zarah?

41:16.556 --> 41:18.476
Zarah, Zarah, it's Josie.
Zarah, Zarah, it's Josie.
Can you hear me?

41:18.476 --> 41:20.186
Zarah, Zarah, it's Josie.
Can you hear me?

41:24.690 --> 41:26.317
Liana...

41:26.317 --> 41:27.775
they took Liana...

41:29.652 --> 41:31.029
Who took her?

41:31.029 --> 41:32.114
Liana?

41:32.114 --> 41:33.781
Head...

41:33.781 --> 41:36.534
Headwood...

41:36.534 --> 41:39.371
and stranger...

41:39.371 --> 41:40.538
not...

41:40.538 --> 41:42.750
not one of us...

41:42.750 --> 41:44.125
Not one of us.
Not one of us.
Liana, take care of Liana.

41:44.125 --> 41:47.128
Not one of us.
Liana, take care of Liana.

41:50.965 --> 41:52.009
We will.

42:00.558 --> 42:01.560
I can't feel anything...

42:06.232 --> 42:07.273
I'm right here.

42:27.127 --> 42:28.337
Everyone fan out.

42:28.462 --> 42:30.630
Javi, you go east.

42:30.630 --> 42:32.382
Alex, you take the north hills,

42:32.382 --> 42:33.551
they're out there somewhere.

42:33.551 --> 42:37.096
Layton...

42:37.096 --> 42:38.764
No, no, no, no,

42:38.764 --> 42:40.431
Zarah?

42:40.431 --> 42:42.518
She was at the bottom

42:42.518 --> 42:43.351
of a cliff.

42:43.351 --> 42:44.395
She was almost gone

42:44.395 --> 42:45.436
when we reached her.

42:47.105 --> 42:49.440
I'm sorry.

43:02.036 --> 43:03.871
Where's Liana?

43:06.500 --> 43:07.668
We don't know.

43:08.918 --> 43:09.752
Where is she?

43:09.752 --> 43:10.753
It was Headwood

43:10.753 --> 43:11.589
and a stranger.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.630
I don't know, Layton.

43:12.630 --> 43:13.632
I don't--

43:13.632 --> 43:16.302
Layton.

43:16.302 --> 43:17.969
Layton, Layton, they've gone.

43:17.969 --> 43:19.679
They have a vehicle.

43:19.679 --> 43:22.141
You'll die if you go out there.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.310
Listen to me, it's too late.

43:24.310 --> 43:25.351
It's too late!

43:25.351 --> 43:29.023
Layton, it's too late.
Layton, it's too late.

43:29.023 --> 43:30.107
Layton, it's too late.

43:58.969 --> 44:00.179
Layton...

44:04.891 --> 44:05.893
I'm going to find
I'm going to find
who took Liana.

44:05.893 --> 44:06.685
I'm going to find
who took Liana.

44:09.855 --> 44:11.273
And I'm going to kill them.

44:14.567 --> 44:15.944
Whatever it takes.

45:00.572 --> 45:02.031
Where are you guys?

45:02.031 --> 45:02.866
What's going on?

45:02.866 --> 45:04.868
Admiral Anton Milius,

45:04.868 --> 45:06.328
International Peace Keeping

45:06.328 --> 45:07.161
Forces.

45:07.161 --> 45:08.706
Survivors?
Survivors?
Everyone remain calm...

45:08.706 --> 45:09.665
Survivors?
Everyone remain calm...

45:10.958 --> 45:12.041
...everyone except you two.

45:12.041 --> 45:12.918
You're taking me
You're taking me
to Melanie Cavill.

45:12.918 --> 45:13.710
You're taking me
to Melanie Cavill.
