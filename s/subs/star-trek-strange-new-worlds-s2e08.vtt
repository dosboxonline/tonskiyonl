12:13.820 --> 12:15.299
If we don't,
more people will die.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.648
When the convoy gets here,

12:16.692 --> 12:17.911
the starships
will have a surgery bay.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.782
Just hang tight, Alvarado, okay?

12:19.826 --> 12:22.393
We need to do something.

12:23.525 --> 12:25.309
Load his pattern
into the buffer.

12:25.353 --> 12:26.963
We can keep him
suspended in there

12:27.007 --> 12:29.052
-until the starships arrive.
-You can do that?

12:29.096 --> 12:31.663
-Show me.
-I do it all the time
with the bad ones.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.187
Load the bio-data

12:33.230 --> 12:34.710
as a backlog
with a pending transport.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.930
Once he's in,
delete the transport.

12:36.973 --> 12:38.670
We can recall the backlog later.

12:40.672 --> 12:42.718
Just hold on.

12:53.729 --> 12:57.037
COMPUTER:
Incoming transport.
Incoming transport.

12:58.821 --> 13:00.344
M'BENGA:
Chief Medical Officer's Log,

13:00.388 --> 13:02.912
USSEnterprise,

13:02.956 --> 13:06.568
stardate 1875.8.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.570
Biobed two has shut down again.

13:08.613 --> 13:11.051
Ever since the Gorn attack
at Finibus Three,

13:11.094 --> 13:12.530
it hasn't been the same.

13:14.750 --> 13:15.882
Dr. M'Benga.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.406
Chris.

13:18.449 --> 13:21.713
Do you have any more
of that Deltan parsley

13:21.757 --> 13:23.411
in your apothecary?

13:28.459 --> 13:30.287
Careful.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.507
Deltan parsley is deadly
in excessive amounts.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.901
And in small amounts, delicious.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.685
[chuckles softly]

13:36.728 --> 13:39.340
You could have just called.

13:39.383 --> 13:41.037
Or sent a yeoman.

13:42.430 --> 13:45.172
Mm-hmm. I wanted
to check in with you.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.652
Because of our Klingon visitor?

13:47.696 --> 13:49.872
I know you and Chapel
were both stationed on J'Gal,

13:49.915 --> 13:53.180
where Rah earned his reputation.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.660
Apparently, there was...

13:55.704 --> 13:58.489
a minor protest
during his last transport,

13:58.533 --> 14:00.535
so we have direct orders.

14:00.578 --> 14:02.885
Klingon War veterans
need to interact with Rah.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.669
We have to make him
feel welcome here,

14:04.713 --> 14:06.410
and we will,
but I don't want that

14:06.454 --> 14:08.021
to come at the personal expense
of anyone on the crew.

14:08.064 --> 14:10.066
I'm fine.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.068
As for Chapel...

14:12.112 --> 14:13.461
PIKE:
Oh. Hey.

14:13.504 --> 14:15.071
All good here, too, Captain.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.551
Great. Good to hear it.

14:16.594 --> 14:17.813
Ultimate goal of the Federation

14:17.857 --> 14:20.772
is to make peace
with our enemies.

14:20.816 --> 14:23.601
True, but it's also
an organization

14:23.645 --> 14:25.865
that waged war
with the Klingons.

14:25.908 --> 14:29.564
As I mentioned, we have orders
from pretty up high.

14:29.607 --> 14:32.262
I'm hosting a dinner tonight
in honor of Ambassador Rah.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.003
It would mean a lot...

14:34.047 --> 14:35.570
I'll be there.

14:35.613 --> 14:37.311
Totally. Me, too.

14:37.354 --> 14:38.965
Thank you.

14:40.053 --> 14:42.098
I appreciate you both
being there.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.058
See you tonight.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.413
Great.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.026
[Chapel exhales shakily]

15:00.682 --> 15:02.597
-We can still ditch this.
-No.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.556
Chris needs us there.

15:05.600 --> 15:08.603
I've handled worse
than polite conversation.

15:09.691 --> 15:11.301
Plus...

15:12.912 --> 15:15.131
...I don't want to give Rah
the satisfaction

15:15.175 --> 15:18.743
of chasing me away
from the captain's table.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.575
Joseph.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.099
We got this.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.840
[echoing]:
We got this.

15:30.451 --> 15:32.061
[echoing]:
Dermal team!

15:32.105 --> 15:34.716
[heart monitor beeping steadily]

15:35.978 --> 15:38.459
[flatline tone]

15:38.502 --> 15:40.200
He's in cardiac arrest.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.679
We're losing him.

15:41.723 --> 15:44.726
-Manual stimulation.
-What?

15:44.769 --> 15:46.815
Grab his heart
and start pumping.

15:53.256 --> 15:54.736
It's not working.

15:57.391 --> 16:00.524
Eyes up. We got this.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.918
We got this.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.093
Say it with me.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.400
-We got this.
-We got this.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.793
-We got this.
-We got this.

16:08.837 --> 16:11.883
That's right.
Continue stimulation.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.321
[heart monitor beeping steadily]

16:14.364 --> 16:15.496
He's back!

16:15.539 --> 16:17.759
Dermal team, now!

16:17.802 --> 16:20.283
-[alarm blaring]
-COMPUTER: Incoming transport.
Incoming transport.

16:20.327 --> 16:23.025
BUCK:
Bills and bows, people!
Bills and bows! Let's go!

16:31.338 --> 16:32.730
WOMAN [over P.A.]:
Attention, all personnel.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.428
Tactical reviews
have been updated

16:34.471 --> 16:37.474
and are available
on your personal datapad.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.303
M'BENGA:
Erica.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.741
Everything all right?

16:43.785 --> 16:45.917
No. The Butcher of J'Gal
is in there,

16:45.961 --> 16:48.094
and everyone's acting like
he's the freaking Dalai Lama.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.009
I've got a bad poker face
when I don't like someone.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.445
I need to bail.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.229
Why didn't you just
tell the captain no?

16:53.273 --> 16:55.797
Why didn't you?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.842
There's a chance General...

16:58.974 --> 17:02.369
...Ambassador Rah
has genuinely reformed.

17:02.412 --> 17:03.935
No, he's pretending.

17:03.979 --> 17:06.373
I sense it,
and I don't want to play along.

17:06.415 --> 17:09.244
Sometimes you pretend
something long enough...

17:10.724 --> 17:13.162
...it becomes the truth.

17:14.424 --> 17:17.732
So let's pretend
the war doesn't bother us,

17:17.775 --> 17:19.342
at least for tonight.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.041
Put on the Starfleet face?

17:23.085 --> 17:24.826
It's a good face.

17:26.654 --> 17:29.178
Plus, Pike made jambalaya.

17:29.222 --> 17:32.094
Ooh, jambalaya?

17:32.138 --> 17:33.965
With Deltan parsley.

17:34.009 --> 17:35.663
[sighs]

17:38.144 --> 17:40.929
RAH:
There were eight delegates
from three separate planets,

17:40.972 --> 17:42.800
and everyone thought
I was crazy.

17:42.844 --> 17:44.715
-And maybe I am.
-[laughter]

17:46.413 --> 17:48.676
The ally ambassador must have
many interesting insights

17:48.719 --> 17:50.330
on delicate matters
of diplomacy.

17:52.332 --> 17:55.074
UNA:
Why did the Federation
send you there alone?

17:55.117 --> 17:57.946
PIKE:
Joseph, Erica, welcome.

17:57.989 --> 17:59.295
Uh, you met
our helmsman earlier,

17:59.339 --> 18:02.951
and this is our CMO,
Dr. M'Benga.

18:02.994 --> 18:04.996
The honor is all mine.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.607
Ambassador.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.261
I hope you're enjoying our ship.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.132
-Christine?
-What?

18:10.176 --> 18:13.614
Oh, you're doing
the word game. Um...

18:13.657 --> 18:16.356
I'm sorry, I don't really
have one right now.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.058
-You are under duress.
-Hmm?

18:24.886 --> 18:27.671
Oh. Yeah.

18:27.715 --> 18:29.543
[laughter]

18:29.586 --> 18:32.023
Is it true that
all peace negotiations

18:32.067 --> 18:35.679
must include
drinking bloodwine in excess?

18:35.723 --> 18:37.725
Peace is not a destination.

18:37.768 --> 18:40.554
It's a journey.
It's a state of mind.

18:40.597 --> 18:42.121
The Klingon need to feel...

18:42.164 --> 18:43.818
SPOCK:
Quite understandable.

18:43.861 --> 18:46.908
I do not know much about
your service in the war, but...

18:46.951 --> 18:49.432
I am available to you if you
ever feel the need to share.

18:49.476 --> 18:52.827
Yeah, I don't, so let's just
change the subject, yeah?

18:52.870 --> 18:54.611
RAH:
Convincing Prospero Alpha

18:54.655 --> 18:58.049
to agree to an armistice
was like getting a Tellarite

18:58.093 --> 18:59.877
-to give a compliment.
-[laughter]

18:59.921 --> 19:01.357
CHAPEL:
I just wish he would shut up
for one second

19:01.401 --> 19:03.794
about all this amazing peace
he's managed.

19:03.838 --> 19:05.883
I can help with that.

19:05.927 --> 19:07.885
ORTEGAS:
He's not wrong.

19:07.929 --> 19:10.018
I was stationed near Prospero.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.324
They are pretty stubborn.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.282
They are stubborn. Correct.

19:13.326 --> 19:15.719
-Often badly.
-Ambassador Rah,

19:15.763 --> 19:17.634
are you familiar with
the ancient Earth text

19:17.678 --> 19:19.332
Sun Tzu's The Art of War?

19:19.375 --> 19:22.378
A most inspired
human masterpiece.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.206
I would love to hear
your views on its comparison

19:24.250 --> 19:27.166
with the Klingon manuscript
mL' parmaq Qoj.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.255
This is a most excellent topic
of conversation,

19:29.298 --> 19:30.995
Mr. Spock. Yes.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.954
All Klingon children

19:32.997 --> 19:36.131
learn mL' parmaq Qoj
practically from birth.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.481
I was introduced
when I was seven.

19:38.525 --> 19:41.310
My father taught me
war and bloodshed,

19:41.354 --> 19:44.574
but my mother taught me
to see and feel...

19:44.618 --> 19:46.881
[conversation continues
indistinctly]

19:46.924 --> 19:48.317
Better make that two.

19:48.361 --> 19:50.711
-Mine's a double.
-Even better.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.149
Why are we here?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.804
You know why.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.460
Our captain needs us.

20:00.503 --> 20:03.550
Why is it so hard to explain
to people who weren't there?

20:07.249 --> 20:09.251
[distant explosions]

20:11.035 --> 20:12.950
General Dak'Rah.

20:12.994 --> 20:16.127
-His men wouldn't let me die.
-That was then.

20:16.171 --> 20:18.129
Now you're here.

20:18.173 --> 20:20.001
Got it?

20:20.044 --> 20:22.351
Focus on getting better.

20:22.395 --> 20:24.266
How's your chest feeling?

20:24.310 --> 20:27.400
Like someone squeezed my heart
with their fingers.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.271
Someone did.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.057
Where are you from, Ensign?

20:33.101 --> 20:34.494
New Angeles.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.583
Terra Luna?

20:36.626 --> 20:38.672
You're a long way
from the shipyards.

20:40.064 --> 20:41.979
We all just call it the Moon.

20:43.764 --> 20:46.070
I have to go
check on other patients.

20:46.114 --> 20:49.117
When I come back, I want to hear
more about the Moon.

21:01.434 --> 21:03.479
The answer is no.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.786
And tell them
to stop sending people.

21:05.829 --> 21:08.223
Nobody sent me.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.922
In fact, they said
you'd turn me down if I tried.

21:14.055 --> 21:15.404
Good.

21:17.928 --> 21:19.539
We're done here.

21:19.582 --> 21:21.671
General Dak'Rah, son of Ra'Ul.

21:21.715 --> 21:23.717
I need help taking him out.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.328
Intel says he's head
of the house here on J'Gal,

21:26.372 --> 21:29.026
running the entire operation
for the Klingons.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.986
M'Benga,
they're killing civilians.

21:32.029 --> 21:34.989
Human and Klingon,
it doesn't matter.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.991
This General Dak'Rah,

21:37.034 --> 21:38.775
he's ordering his men
to kill on sight

21:38.819 --> 21:40.516
anyone that isn't
a Klingon soldier.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.779
After they torture them.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.695
What are you doing,
hiding behind the wire?

21:45.739 --> 21:47.436
Everyone knows the stories.

21:47.480 --> 21:50.439
The most
hand-to-hand kills confirmed.

21:50.483 --> 21:52.702
I'm just a doctor now.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.967
I prefer saving lives
to taking them.

21:57.011 --> 21:59.187
And I need quick and silent.

21:59.230 --> 22:00.710
I need you.

22:00.754 --> 22:02.321
I gave you my answer.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.497
Protocol 12.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.499
It was discontinued.

22:06.542 --> 22:10.894
Starfleet won't make it anymore,
but I heard you still have some.

22:10.938 --> 22:13.680
-You heard wrong.
-You designed it, right?

22:13.723 --> 22:15.029
Make more.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.510
Even if I could, I wouldn't.

22:17.553 --> 22:19.599
It turns out that
pumping your body

22:19.642 --> 22:21.557
full of adrenaline
and pain inhibitors

22:21.601 --> 22:22.950
is bad for your health.

22:22.993 --> 22:25.648
I'd rather die tomorrow
than today.

22:27.084 --> 22:29.609
Come on, be reasonable.
My team needs an edge.

22:36.877 --> 22:38.531
RAH:
The negotiations
almost fell apart

22:38.574 --> 22:40.141
when the chancellor said to me,

22:40.184 --> 22:44.885
"How is it that a Klingon

22:44.928 --> 22:47.366
is speaking on behalf
of the Federation?"

22:47.409 --> 22:48.889
[Pike chuckles]

22:48.932 --> 22:51.500
That's a good question.
How did you respond?

22:51.544 --> 22:53.328
I simply told him the truth.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.896
Who I am and who I was.

22:55.939 --> 22:58.115
And what the Federation
did for me.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.335
It saved my life.

23:02.685 --> 23:04.121
J'Gal changed me.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.647
J'Gal changed a lot of us.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.439
You were on J'Gal?

23:17.483 --> 23:18.484
I was.

23:18.527 --> 23:20.616
The final conflict.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.792
And the massacre
of Colony Athos.

23:22.836 --> 23:26.230
RAH:
Then you both know my pain
all too well.
