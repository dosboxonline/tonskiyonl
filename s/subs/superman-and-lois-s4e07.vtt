09:12.678 --> 09:15.137
and we finally found a house.

09:15.138 --> 09:18.015
Lois, it's <i>the</i> house.
- That's amazing.

09:18.016 --> 09:20.434
- Except it's not even
remotely in our price range.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.979
And I've been over and over it,

09:22.980 --> 09:27.900
and the only way we'll ever
be able to afford it is...

09:27.901 --> 09:30.654
if I sell my share
of the "Gazette."

09:32.114 --> 09:33.656
- Chrissy.

09:33.657 --> 09:36.325
- I'm really sorry.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.995
- Well, you don't get to make a
decision like that without me.

09:38.996 --> 09:41.289
I thought we were
building something here.

09:41.290 --> 09:43.207
- We are.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.375
We were.

09:44.376 --> 09:46.127
- We're supposed to be a team.

09:46.128 --> 09:48.129
- And I love our team.
I really do.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.339
But I'm about to have
a new team.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.925
And the way this baby stomps
on my bladder every minute,

09:52.926 --> 09:55.303
they're gonna need a yard
to run around in.

09:55.304 --> 09:57.346
- No, I get that.
Of course I do.

09:57.347 --> 09:59.682
I just--if you sell,

09:59.683 --> 10:01.809
that could mean the end
of the "Gazette."

10:01.810 --> 10:04.353

I'd ever want.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.274
Working with you

10:27.502 --> 10:29.295

10:29.296 --> 10:31.756
But this baby's kicking
around in there again,

11:09.211 --> 11:11.212
I saw him earlier today
with the boys.

11:11.213 --> 11:13.756
He was accusing Jon
of cheating at football

11:13.757 --> 11:15.800
and then talking about

11:15.801 --> 11:17.676

[laughter]

12:27.789 --> 12:29.540

Should I have struck out?

12:29.541 --> 12:30.958

12:38.842 --> 12:41.552

Not really.

And besides,
Malcolm and Wellnitz

12:43.180 --> 12:44.847

12:46.349 --> 12:49.727
And we just let them

12:49.728 --> 12:50.936
- With him coming
at us like that,

12:50.937 --> 12:53.272
we didn't really have a choice.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.191
Besides, Timmy

12:55.192 --> 12:57.026
You didn't even have
powers back then.

12:57.027 --> 12:59.737
- Yeah, but I can't say that
and defend myself.

12:59.738 --> 13:01.030
I had to lie about it.

13:01.031 --> 13:02.948

- Yep.

13:08.038 --> 13:10.206
She already called
that awful conglomerate

13:10.207 --> 13:12.833
that tried to buy us out
a while back.

13:12.834 --> 13:14.919
- But reporting

13:14.920 --> 13:16.212
And you two make a great team.

13:22.511 --> 13:23.677
- What?

13:23.678 --> 13:25.930
Grilling is his superpower.

13:25.931 --> 13:28.934
There's gotta be another way
for them to get their house.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.021
- Hey.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.942
So I hear Timmy Ryan
knows you two have powers?

13:38.527 --> 13:40.402
- He doesn't know.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.446
Not for sure, anyway.

13:42.447 --> 13:46.242
But he was pretty mad.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.077
- Okay, so I'm gonna have
to add him to the list.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.411
Look, just tell me now.

13:49.412 --> 13:52.082
Is there anyone else
who might know?

13:55.001 --> 13:56.126
- Candice knows.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.711
- You told your girlfriend?

13:57.712 --> 13:59.213
- He didn't. I did.

13:59.214 --> 14:00.548
- What? When?

14:00.549 --> 14:02.424
- When she was visiting.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.968
- She's known since the 4th?

14:03.969 --> 14:05.469
- Well, I had to keep
sneaking off to help Mom,

14:05.470 --> 14:06.720
and she knew I was lying.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.305
- So this is my fault?
- No!

14:08.306 --> 14:09.807
And I wasn't gonna tell her,
but she was really hurt,

14:09.808 --> 14:11.141
and she was about to break up
with me.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.018
- Then you let her.
- Dad, come on.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.895
- Don't even start with me.
You should know better.

14:14.896 --> 14:16.230
- Yeah, I do.

14:16.231 --> 14:17.982
'Cause I lost Sarah
for the same reason,

14:17.983 --> 14:19.316
and I didn't want Jon
to have to go through that.

14:19.317 --> 14:20.943
- This isn't about
what you want.

14:20.944 --> 14:22.653
That wasn't your
decision to make.

14:22.654 --> 14:24.446
- We can trust Candice.

14:24.447 --> 14:26.865
- You can't possibly know that.
She's 16.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.450
She doesn't even
live in Smallville.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.952
- Like everyone in this town
isn't already

14:29.953 --> 14:30.953
telling everyone else about it.

14:30.954 --> 14:32.371
- I'm fixing that.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.539
- Sure, you are.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.790
- What don't you two get?

14:34.791 --> 14:36.584
The secret is everything.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.627
It's the only thing that gives
us a chance at a normal life.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.796
- This life is hardly normal.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.214
- But it's
the only one we have.

14:42.215 --> 14:44.133
So both of you
will do everything you can

14:44.134 --> 14:48.012

or Timmy or anyone.

14:48.013 --> 14:49.346

And his parents,
they meant well,

15:49.658 --> 15:51.867
And his parents were
terrified that if anyone

15:51.868 --> 15:53.243
found out what he
was capable of,

15:53.244 --> 15:55.329
he'd be taken away from them.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.040
So he grew up
with that constant fear.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.250

16:00.251 --> 16:02.044

No, Chrissy, the "Gazette"

17:34.971 --> 17:36.430

been more than enough

17:37.766 --> 17:38.891
