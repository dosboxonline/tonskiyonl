12:09.685 --> 12:12.209
You sent in a song,
and then we all...

12:12.253 --> 12:14.081
-sang?
-Why are we singing?

12:14.124 --> 12:15.647
I believe the song created
a resonant frequency

12:15.691 --> 12:17.824
and dislodged something
from the fold,

12:17.867 --> 12:19.869
a quantum uncertainty field.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.784
Okay, why would that
make us sing?

12:21.828 --> 12:24.047
Imagine an area of space where
quantum uncertainties collapse

12:24.091 --> 12:26.702
so rapidly and randomly
that new realities are created.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.618
In one such reality,
people sing uncontrollably.

12:29.661 --> 12:32.795
PELIA:
A musical reality.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.101
Indeed.

12:34.144 --> 12:37.147
So, what's next--
more improbability?

12:37.191 --> 12:39.976
Or will we just suddenly
poof into bunnies?

12:40.020 --> 12:42.239
I would prefer
not to be a bunny, either.

12:42.283 --> 12:44.241
SPOCK:
I doubt we will be bunnies,

12:44.285 --> 12:45.765
but we may not be done
with singing.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.636
Simulations reveal
we have become tethered

12:47.679 --> 12:49.856
to this particular
improbability field.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.988
Attempting to fly out
would likely make it wider.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.077
PELIA:
It looks like a zipper,

12:54.121 --> 12:56.079
which begs the question:

12:56.123 --> 12:58.473
might it function like a zipper?

12:58.516 --> 12:59.909
PIKE:
Zippers work both ways. Could we

12:59.953 --> 13:01.693
use it to close
the improbability field

13:01.737 --> 13:03.652
-back inside the fold?
-SPOCK: Potentially.

13:03.695 --> 13:06.394
If we combined shield harmonics
with the Heisenberg compensator.

13:06.437 --> 13:07.830
You would have to connect both
to the deflector array

13:07.874 --> 13:09.136
and generate a beam.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.094
That means connecting them
manually.

13:11.138 --> 13:12.487
Let's do it, uh,
we don't know

13:12.530 --> 13:14.228
how all this singing
will affect us,

13:14.271 --> 13:16.143
and I'd rather not find out.
Best to nip it in the bud.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.275
Mr. Spock,
you explained that very well.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.800
I almost understood it.

13:23.106 --> 13:24.455
SPOCK:
Our zipper beam
must precisely match

13:24.499 --> 13:26.457
the resonance of the fold.

13:26.501 --> 13:28.764
What was the exact frequency
of the song we sent through?

13:28.808 --> 13:30.635
UHURA:
One moment.

13:33.900 --> 13:35.162
Is that transmission
regarding Nurse Chapel's

13:35.205 --> 13:36.859
recent fellowship application?

13:36.903 --> 13:39.557
Was the news... favorable?

13:39.601 --> 13:41.603
I don't look
at personal correspondence.

13:42.604 --> 13:44.519
Of course.
That would be unethical.

13:45.563 --> 13:47.870
You and Nurse Chapel have
become close, haven't you?

13:49.872 --> 13:51.743
I suppose it would
be accurate to say

13:51.787 --> 13:54.181

more than colleagues.

What just happened?
Why did I admit all that?

24:40.522 --> 24:41.697
I told you.

24:41.741 --> 24:43.612
This is a security threat.

24:43.656 --> 24:45.222
But-but the singing...
I... The...

24:45.266 --> 24:46.833
How did that happen
on the Cayuga,too?

24:46.876 --> 24:49.313
Because the improbability field
is expanding...

24:50.358 --> 24:52.534
...across the whole subspace
communications network.

24:54.318 --> 24:56.320
To the entire fleet.

25:08.289 --> 25:09.377
UNA:
Admiral April's
last message confirmed

25:09.420 --> 25:10.857
that the improbability field

25:10.900 --> 25:13.424
has now spread
to 12 Federation ships.

25:13.468 --> 25:16.384
He let me know in a
surprisingly beautiful baritone

25:16.427 --> 25:18.821
that he wants us
to stop this now, by the way.

25:18.865 --> 25:20.736
Do we have any idea why
this reality's compelling us

25:20.780 --> 25:22.521
to confess our deepest emotions?

25:22.564 --> 25:24.000
UHURA:
I have a theory.

25:24.044 --> 25:25.828
I think since
we're in a musical reality,

25:25.872 --> 25:28.483
we're actually following
the rules of musicals.

25:28.527 --> 25:31.878
So, when do characters in
musicals usually begin to sing?

25:32.922 --> 25:36.012
When their emotions
are so heightened

25:36.056 --> 25:38.580
that words won't suffice.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.669
UHURA:
This musical reality
wants us to sing

25:40.713 --> 25:42.541
about what's most pressing
on our minds.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.108
These emotions have the power

25:45.152 --> 25:47.763
to overwhelm our capacity
for rational thinking.

25:47.807 --> 25:51.027
They also have the potential
to drive us apart.

25:51.071 --> 25:52.246
PIKE:
The subspace fold--

25:52.289 --> 25:54.117
I think we should blow it up.

25:54.161 --> 25:55.858
Use the photon torpedoes
to bring down the curtain

25:55.902 --> 25:57.773
-on this thing for good.
-That has potential.

25:57.817 --> 25:59.514
-Really?
-Since we are the focal point

25:59.558 --> 26:01.777
of this subspace fold,

26:01.821 --> 26:04.432
a matter/antimatter blast
might untether the Enterprise

26:04.475 --> 26:06.565
and reverse the musical reality
for all affected.

26:06.608 --> 26:08.654
But it would be prudent
to test this theory

26:08.697 --> 26:10.177
in a controlled environment,

26:10.220 --> 26:11.874
in case it is more explosive
than intended.

26:11.918 --> 26:14.703
What if we could isolate
and transport...

26:14.747 --> 26:17.314
Subatomic particles
from the fold.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.447
Sorry.

26:19.490 --> 26:21.362
I shouldn't have interrupted you

26:21.405 --> 26:23.233
because you had
that thought first.

26:23.277 --> 26:24.974
UNA:
Locking in
on something that small

26:25.018 --> 26:27.150
would require cross-targeting.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.197
It's a two-person job.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.548
Well, luckily you have
two persons right here.

26:38.422 --> 26:39.772
UNA:
You're refusing an assignment?

26:39.815 --> 26:41.034
This isn't like you, La'An.

26:41.077 --> 26:42.731
That's the problem.

26:42.775 --> 26:44.994
I'm not behaving like myself.

26:45.038 --> 26:46.692
None of us are.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.563
You're afraid of singing.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.043
-To James.
-What?

26:51.000 --> 26:52.262
You can stop hiding it.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.090
I see how you act around him.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.092
What-what do you mean? I'm...
How-how do I act around him?

26:56.136 --> 26:59.356
You don't want me
to answer that.

27:02.098 --> 27:03.709
Okay.

27:03.752 --> 27:06.929
Hypothetically, let's say
I have feelings for him,

27:06.973 --> 27:09.062
and those feelings
pose an actual

27:09.105 --> 27:11.020
space-time security risk.

27:12.979 --> 27:14.633
I should just tell him.

27:14.676 --> 27:15.982
That's the responsible
thing to do.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.636
Before it happens
outside of my control.

27:17.679 --> 27:19.594
I should just suck it up,
stop being a child

27:19.638 --> 27:20.595

30:51.371 --> 30:53.242
Lieutenant Spock,
I have the particles.

30:53.286 --> 30:54.678
They're coming your way.

31:00.771 --> 31:02.077
Wow.

31:02.121 --> 31:03.949
That was exciting.

31:03.992 --> 31:06.908
I mean, Spock and Uhura
get to blow it up,

31:06.952 --> 31:09.824
which is the real fun part,
but, uh...

31:09.868 --> 31:11.826
We make a good pair.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.132
We should team up more often.

subatomic particles

31:37.765 --> 31:39.549

31:39.593 --> 31:41.551
SPOCK:
Firing on the field
would be devastating.

31:41.595 --> 31:42.857
As you can see
in this simulation,

31:42.901 --> 31:44.424
the explosion would propagate

31:44.467 --> 31:45.686
through the entire
Federation subspace network,

31:45.729 --> 31:47.601
destroying everything.

31:47.644 --> 31:51.039
It would be like soaking the
improbability field in kerosene

31:51.083 --> 31:52.998
and holding a match to it.

31:53.041 --> 31:55.478
Then we need a plan C.

31:55.522 --> 31:57.916
Sir, I'm getting a hail.

31:57.959 --> 32:00.483
Don't answer. We can't risk
spreading this further.

32:00.527 --> 32:02.224
I am triangulating the source.

32:02.268 --> 32:03.965
There appears to be
an incoming warp signal

32:04.009 --> 32:05.358
heading our way fast.

32:05.401 --> 32:07.229
The signal
has Klingon encryption.

32:07.273 --> 32:10.015
The last thing anyone wants
is singing Klingons.

32:10.058 --> 32:12.669
Uhura, send a message by proxy
order of Starfleet Command.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.845
Tell them they must
turn around immediately.

32:14.889 --> 32:18.240
They've stopped hailing,
but I'm getting a message back.

32:21.896 --> 32:24.290
The improbability field's
already hit them.

32:26.727 --> 32:28.163
Standby for playback.

32:29.164 --> 32:33.081
This is General Garkog of the
Imperial Klingon Defense Force.

32:33.125 --> 32:37.129
Your evasion
raises much suspicion.

32:38.347 --> 32:40.306
We have located the abominable

32:40.349 --> 32:42.743
source of our dishonor

32:42.786 --> 32:45.311
and will destroy it immediately.

32:45.354 --> 32:47.617
Make no attempt to stop us.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.621
They're going to fire
on the fold.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.196
Their ship will be here
in two hours.

33:01.240 --> 33:03.503
I've hailed them repeatedly.
They refuse to answer.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.635
If they complete their mission,
everyone affected

33:05.679 --> 33:07.811
by the improbability field
will be destroyed.

33:07.855 --> 33:10.510
So, just the entire Federation
and half the Klingon Empire.

33:10.553 --> 33:12.207
We have to stop them
at all costs.

33:12.251 --> 33:13.992
Number One, analysis?

33:14.035 --> 33:15.602
Well, striking them first
would constitute an act of war.

33:15.645 --> 33:17.430
PIKE:
Not much choice here,
I'm afraid.

33:17.473 --> 33:19.649
What if we just find a way to
disable their disruptor cannons?

33:19.693 --> 33:21.390
And their torpedo launchers.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.697
That's a lot to disable
before they get off a shot.

33:23.740 --> 33:26.265
We need a tactical strategy
immediately. La'An?

33:26.308 --> 33:27.962

33:29.137 --> 33:30.747

33:34.534 --> 33:36.318
PIKE:
Mr. Spock, Uhura,

33:36.362 --> 33:38.407
what are the odds we can shut
down the improbability field

33:38.451 --> 33:40.061
before the Klingons get here?

33:40.105 --> 33:42.281
Not good. At least,
according to the data we have.

33:42.324 --> 33:43.847
Then find new data.

33:43.891 --> 33:45.501
You both need to fix this.

33:45.545 --> 33:47.460
You're applying old rules
to a new reality.

33:47.503 --> 33:50.202
I suggest you find
a different tempo, fast.

33:52.465 --> 33:55.337
Studying the songs themselves.
Brilliant.

33:55.381 --> 33:57.426
Not just the songs
but the frequencies

33:57.470 --> 33:59.167
the moment a song begins.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.561
If we can isolate a pattern
in the improbability field

34:01.604 --> 34:05.217
we might learn how to generate
an improbability-breaking event.

34:05.260 --> 34:08.219
Now, how to trigger a song?

34:08.263 --> 34:10.309
Well, per our musical rules,

34:10.351 --> 34:12.005
we just need to wait
until someone

34:12.050 --> 34:13.920

the ship's in trouble.

34:27.152 --> 34:28.630
We could, but that
wouldn't be fun.

Okay. Uh, I-I need to just
say this before it comes out

38:07.023 --> 38:10.244
in the form of
a 17th-century sea shanty.

38:12.202 --> 38:15.380

I mean, not youyou.
We-Well, I know you now,

38:18.600 --> 38:21.081
but I mean before.
In a different...

38:22.778 --> 38:23.997
...time,

38:24.040 --> 38:25.825
I met another you.

38:25.868 --> 38:27.783
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:27.827 --> 38:30.917
I-I don't love rules,
but I'm pretty sure

38:30.960 --> 38:32.658
you're about to break
a big one.

38:32.701 --> 38:35.356
The other you, he, um...

38:38.185 --> 38:39.882
He saw the real me.

38:41.754 --> 38:43.843
Beyond my name, beyond
all that name stands for.

38:43.886 --> 38:45.410
He'd never even heard it before.

38:46.802 --> 38:49.327
And I-I liked it.

38:50.502 --> 38:53.592
I liked the way he looked at me.

38:56.899 --> 39:00.250
Because through his eyes,
I could finally see the person

39:00.294 --> 39:01.730
I had the potential to be.

39:03.776 --> 39:05.647
And it was someone

39:05.691 --> 39:08.433
who wasn't burdened by...

39:08.476 --> 39:10.173
tragedy and darkness.

39:10.217 --> 39:12.915
Someone who could find hope
and live in that hope.

39:14.656 --> 39:17.746
Someone free-free
to feel and-and...

39:19.922 --> 39:22.098
...take chances and, um...

39:28.540 --> 39:31.369
And make connections.

39:36.504 --> 39:39.942
But then, uh...

39:39.986 --> 39:43.381
he was gone, and with him,

39:43.424 --> 39:45.731
that version of myself
was gone, too.

39:47.472 --> 39:49.125
And... that's...

39:49.169 --> 39:50.649
that was what I wanted to say.

39:59.179 --> 40:02.008
Am I anything like
the other me?

40:05.490 --> 40:07.405
No.

40:09.711 --> 40:12.453
And-and yes.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.415
I like how
you look at me, too.

40:18.416 --> 40:21.244
In what way?

40:25.901 --> 40:28.251
Like you really see me.

40:39.132 --> 40:40.612
I'd be lying if I said

40:40.655 --> 40:42.483
I didn't feel
the connection, too.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.224
When you first called me...

40:46.444 --> 40:48.402
...I felt like I knew you.

40:48.446 --> 40:51.927
But I'm not that James Kirk.

40:51.971 --> 40:54.234
Of course, it was
inappropriate, and I am...

40:54.277 --> 40:56.410
No, La'An,
you don't understand, my...

40:56.454 --> 40:59.239
my life is complicated.

40:59.282 --> 41:02.547
Not time-travel complicated, but

41:02.590 --> 41:04.157
I'm in a relationship.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.160
A sometimes relationship,

41:07.203 --> 41:08.509
and right now
is one of those times

41:08.553 --> 41:11.469
in a very real way.

41:12.687 --> 41:15.298
-My God, if I'd have known, I...
-How could you have?

41:15.342 --> 41:18.084
I actually think
you'd like Carol.

41:18.127 --> 41:22.610
You're both dedicated
to your jobs, intensely.

41:22.654 --> 41:25.004

on Starbase One.

41:26.048 --> 41:28.529
I tend not to stay
in the same place

41:28.573 --> 41:30.836
for very long, which is...

41:33.316 --> 41:35.841
...a growing problem,
because Carol is...

41:38.365 --> 41:39.975
...pregnant.

41:42.064 --> 41:43.718
Oh, um...

41:47.722 --> 41:49.115
Wow.

41:50.116 --> 41:53.293

only...

42:11.529 --> 42:12.834
there is none.

42:14.749 --> 42:18.361
I didn't expect Christine
to be so definitive

42:18.405 --> 42:20.712
about ending our arrangement.

42:22.583 --> 42:25.151
