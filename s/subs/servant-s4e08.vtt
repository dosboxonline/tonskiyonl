01:07.734 --> 01:11.655
<i>Well, it's still unclear
how many Philly residents have lost power,</i>

01:11.738 --> 01:16.159
<i>but our 8 News mobile team
on the scene in Kensington,</i>

01:16.243 --> 01:19.162
<i>where we have yet another location.</i>

01:19.246 --> 01:22.040
<i>As you know, Walker,
we have a Category 2 storm</i>

01:22.124 --> 01:24.334
<i>nearing the greater Philadelphia area,</i>

01:24.418 --> 01:27.337
<i>part of an increasingly bizarre pattern
of seasonal weather.</i>

01:27.421 --> 01:30.424
<i>Out here in Center City,
it's already quite gusty.</i>

01:30.507 --> 01:32.634
<i>Should we be worried about flooding?</i>

01:32.718 --> 01:35.429
<i>We do have a flash flood warning
in effect.</i>

01:35.512 --> 01:37.097
<i>Lots of stalled cars.</i>

01:37.181 --> 01:40.309
<i>And it looks like the storm drains
are just barely keeping up.</i>

01:40.392 --> 01:42.019
<i>Jeff, can you show the folks at home?</i>

01:42.978 --> 01:44.688
<i>What is that strange noise?</i>

01:51.904 --> 01:57.492
<i>Wow. You've heard that expression,
"like rats climbing the mast," maybe?</i>

01:57.576 --> 01:58.994
<i>That's what that looked like.</i>

01:59.077 --> 02:01.330
<i>Speaking of rats, Center for Disease--</i>

02:25.229 --> 02:28.398
<i>All air travel
at Philadelphia International Airport</i>

02:28.482 --> 02:30.609
<i>has been suspended at this time,</i>

02:30.692 --> 02:33.403
<i>and road closings may not be far behind.</i>

02:33.487 --> 02:35.906
<i>Tonight's storm coincides
with a lunar eclipse,</i>

02:35.989 --> 02:38.200
<i>so it really is black as night out there.</i>

02:38.283 --> 02:41.703
<i>Now, have you ever wondered
what happens to animals?</i>

02:44.081 --> 02:45.207
What are you reading?

02:48.460 --> 02:49.461
Just--

02:49.962 --> 02:53.465
You know me. I like to read weird stuff.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.426
Psychiatric disorders?

02:57.261 --> 02:59.054
Are you afraid you're losing your mind?

03:02.558 --> 03:06.979
Hang on. One. Two. Three.

03:08.397 --> 03:09.398
Three seconds.

03:09.481 --> 03:12.150
That means the storm's epicenter
is three miles away.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.528
Does it scare you?

03:15.112 --> 03:16.154
Of course not.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.824
You're scared of something.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.955
I mean, maybe on a macro level,

03:25.038 --> 03:27.708
I'm a little scared
of extreme weather events.

03:27.791 --> 03:31.086
But every storm is
the storm of the century.

03:31.170 --> 03:32.838
That's how they keep us watching.

03:35.424 --> 03:39.553
I wouldn't wait up for me tonight.
I had a shitload of coffee this afternoon.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.638
Okay.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.937
<i>…flee to the west coast.</i>

03:49.021 --> 03:51.523
<i>Flash flood alerts
from Missouri to Arkansas,</i>

03:51.607 --> 03:53.817
<i>continuing east towards Pennsylvania.</i>

03:53.901 --> 03:55.402
<i>As far as Philly is concerned,</i>

03:55.485 --> 03:57.779
<i>this really could be
the storm of the century.</i>

03:57.863 --> 04:00.616
<i>Motorists are advised
to avoid the Schuylkill Expressway.</i>

04:00.699 --> 04:03.493
<i>As we continue to follow the storm
coming up from the south,</i>

04:03.577 --> 04:05.996
-<i>you can see the warm front lifting--</i>
-Would you shut that off?

04:06.079 --> 04:07.664
<i>As it continues--</i>

04:08.707 --> 04:09.875
Shit. He woke up.

04:12.044 --> 04:15.130
Sometimes if you don't make eye contact,
he'll go back to sleep.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.510
Why'd you bring the crib in?

04:21.345 --> 04:22.596
He's safe in here.

04:23.430 --> 04:27.059
I mean, if the storm wakes him up,
he'll feel better if he's with us.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.980
-Wait. Did you check all the windows?
-Of course.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.024
And did you put the big towel
under the back door?

04:34.107 --> 04:36.485
-Because that weather stripping leaks.
-I did the big towel.

04:45.702 --> 04:47.871
I don't even want to think
about the basement.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.860
We can't stay in the park anymore.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.278
What do you want us to do?

05:20.237 --> 05:22.614
If the storm doesn't want you here,
then you should go.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.909
We can't leave you here all alone.
It's not safe.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.203
Do you trust me?

05:31.874 --> 05:33.250
You're my whole heart.

05:34.960 --> 05:35.794
Then go.

05:37.296 --> 05:38.589
Take the others.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.884
And be my voice in the world.

06:31.016 --> 06:32.601
Sorry I'm late.

06:32.684 --> 06:35.020
I had to wait for Dorothy to fall asleep.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.898
You sure he can get in the other end?

06:38.941 --> 06:41.068
He said we just have to get her in there.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.489
And he's just gonna talk to her, right?

06:45.572 --> 06:48.116
Take her somewhere and deprogram her?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.702
Absolutely. It'll be good for her.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.249
You're gonna have to bring her though.
She trusts you.

06:55.332 --> 06:58.085
No way. She trusts you
way more than she trusts me.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.795
You're like a father figure.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.922
But she knows
I've been trying to get rid of her.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.590
Also, how am I gonna say,

07:03.674 --> 07:06.260
"Hey, I wanna see you in the basement
at 2:00 a.m.?"

07:07.261 --> 07:09.847
Besides, if you do it,
you can make it a sex thing.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.098
Wow.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.894
Just when I thought you couldn't make this
any more disgusting or morally abhorrent.

07:15.978 --> 07:17.271
Oh, yeah, you're right.

07:18.188 --> 07:21.733
We should grab her and drag her down
four goddamn flights of stairs, Julian.

07:21.817 --> 07:24.611
She's a fucked-up crazy person who's been
stalking your sister half her life.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.530
Are you with me on this or not?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.074
-I'll get her down, okay?
-Good.

07:36.832 --> 07:38.000
Sean?

07:39.626 --> 07:40.878
Sean?

07:46.717 --> 07:47.718
Goddamn it.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.313
Can you get something to clean up
this mess so it doesn't destroy the floor?

08:52.908 --> 08:53.909
Oh, Leanne.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.454
I never met anyone like you.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.541
Sometimes you remind me of myself.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.004
Make sure you get under that lamp.

09:08.549 --> 09:12.344
You and I, we're both… tenacious.

09:13.637 --> 09:14.847
Never give up.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.519
That's not always a good thing.

09:22.771 --> 09:25.399
You keep acting like
there's something wrong with me.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.610
Like you want to get rid of me.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.448
All I ever try and do is make you happy.

09:34.199 --> 09:37.202
It's not your job to make me happy.
It never was.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.249
Why is it so impossible
for you to like me?

09:42.958 --> 09:44.960
Oh, Leanne.

09:45.711 --> 09:51.091
The world is full of people out there.
Why does it have to be me?

09:52.676 --> 09:55.137
Even Sean and Julian
don't like me anymore.

09:55.721 --> 09:58.557
Maybe you could explain to them
that I'm not a monster.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.063
-Do you need help with your brace?
-No.

10:05.147 --> 10:06.815
No, it's okay. I can take it off for you--

10:06.899 --> 10:08.859
No, it's fine.
I don't even need it anymore.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.445
-But the doctor said--
-Oh, my God, Leanne, please.

10:11.528 --> 10:14.281
Let me try and handle
this one thing on my own.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.910
Maybe we can keep talking.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.205
Perhaps I can help you see things
a different way.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.844
Is that all you've got?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.149
What the fuck are you doing? Get down!

12:21.658 --> 12:23.744
It's all for me, Julian.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.332
Don't you get it?

12:28.415 --> 12:31.960
The storm. All of it. It's for me!

12:32.044 --> 12:35.297
And he thinks that he can beat me,
but he can't.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.216
'Cause I've won.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.136
Come downstairs.
I wanna show you something.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.266
No.

12:49.603 --> 12:50.604
Sean!

12:51.438 --> 12:52.439
Julian!

12:58.111 --> 12:59.321
Sean!

13:00.280 --> 13:02.616
Please, let me go.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.769
-Can't see anything.
-Just keep going.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.130
Hello, Leanne.

14:02.176 --> 14:03.594
Who are they?

14:04.970 --> 14:06.471
You two should go now.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.310
Why is there a fire?

14:14.646 --> 14:15.856
Doesn't matter. Come on.

14:16.899 --> 14:18.025
Come on. It's done.

15:01.360 --> 15:02.778
I'm coming, baby.

15:04.530 --> 15:05.989
I'm coming, sweetie.

15:13.455 --> 15:18.168
Okay, baby. It's okay. Okay. Mama's here.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.846
We did it. It's over. She's gone.

15:33.225 --> 15:37.563
We don't need you to be uncomfortable.
I only need you to listen.

15:44.361 --> 15:45.529
Very well.

15:46.321 --> 15:48.365
Why should we pretend…

15:49.992 --> 15:54.788
these frail bits of rope can contain you?

15:56.164 --> 15:58.333
We both know exactly what you are.

16:05.048 --> 16:07.176
If I've ever shown you any kindness,

16:08.677 --> 16:10.888
I beg you to remember that.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.893
When you first came to this house,
it was an act of love,

16:16.768 --> 16:19.771
but that love was a selfish love.

16:20.564 --> 16:24.985
It has brought death
and destruction down upon us all.

16:26.153 --> 16:30.949
Anything bad that happens in the world
is because of him. Not me.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.243
You misunderstand him.

16:34.912 --> 16:37.998
He does not see you or me.

16:39.249 --> 16:43.212
His perfect order is too great
for us to comprehend.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.256
We can only serve it.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.718
You've been telling me that nonsense
my entire life.

16:51.637 --> 16:53.639
I don't believe it anymore.

16:54.640 --> 16:57.351
I will never serve him again. Ever.

16:58.810 --> 17:02.481
Then you truly have fallen.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.366
Stop that.

17:12.950 --> 17:17.119
I will weep until I have
no more strength to weep,

17:17.204 --> 17:19.080
because the world is lost.

17:19.665 --> 17:20.999
Don't be ridiculous.

17:22.334 --> 17:25.963
It may not be the world that he wants,
but the sun will still rise every day.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.799
No, it won't. The signs are clear.

17:29.550 --> 17:31.009
Look around you.

17:31.802 --> 17:34.054
You should not exist.

17:34.972 --> 17:41.186
You are an open wound in the earth,
and now the whole world suffers.

17:41.270 --> 17:45.482
The ones you love, Dorothy, this family,

17:45.566 --> 17:48.277
you have trapped them in a living hell.

17:49.736 --> 17:52.447
This deluge tonight is only the beginning.

17:53.782 --> 17:57.953
A world out of balance
is a world of endless suffering,

17:58.036 --> 18:00.956
unless you choose to end it

18:02.332 --> 18:04.293
and save us all.

18:29.526 --> 18:32.529
We have tried to offer you the true death,

18:33.822 --> 18:35.699
but none of us can kill you.

18:35.782 --> 18:41.205
Your rage and your self-will
burn too bright.

18:42.164 --> 18:45.792
Only one creature can do it.

18:47.419 --> 18:49.505
One creature is strong enough.

18:52.549 --> 18:53.842
You.

18:58.639 --> 18:59.723
I can't.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.935
I'll be right here to help you,
little flower.

19:03.936 --> 19:06.688
First your eyes, then your limbs.

19:07.814 --> 19:11.902
If you truly love the Turners, give them
the life they were meant to have.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.654
Set them free.

19:15.113 --> 19:18.200
And know that
they will always remember you.

19:21.495 --> 19:25.624
And best of all,
God will forgive you all your sins…

19:27.501 --> 19:28.919
and your wickedness.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.632
Who said I was wicked?

19:51.441 --> 19:52.442
Go.

19:55.404 --> 19:57.906
We're still in here. Come quick!

19:58.699 --> 19:59.700
Look out!

20:01.535 --> 20:02.578
Stop!

20:43.327 --> 20:44.494
He's all yours.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.172
Who's that?

21:00.385 --> 21:01.803
That wasn't part of the plan.

21:10.145 --> 21:13.315
Don't. Put it down.
You'll just make it worse.

21:15.609 --> 21:18.070
She's just a deranged girl. We got this.

21:24.660 --> 21:26.245
Did you hear that?

21:26.328 --> 21:28.497
She said
the storms were all because of her.

21:30.916 --> 21:34.253
That's bullshit. That's just wind.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.365
Oh, fuck.

22:08.704 --> 22:11.623
I'm so sorry for what we did to you.

22:13.876 --> 22:17.296
Please. My phone is on the table.

22:18.130 --> 22:20.299
I just need to call 911 for Sean.

23:09.264 --> 23:10.766
No. Stay away from me!

23:16.271 --> 23:18.065
-Get away from me!
-Sean!

23:28.408 --> 23:29.409
Sean!

23:39.127 --> 23:40.587
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

23:40.671 --> 23:42.548
I need two ambulances.

23:43.048 --> 23:44.550
9780 Spruce Street.

23:46.051 --> 23:47.302
There's been an accident.

23:53.267 --> 23:54.351
Leanne.

23:57.396 --> 24:01.191
What's happened? Where's Sean?

24:02.985 --> 24:04.611
Shh.

24:05.195 --> 24:07.155
You should make sure Jericho's okay.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.751
<i>Nanny said it was an accident.</i>

24:40.063 --> 24:42.482
I'm never gonna let you
back in this house.

25:29.780 --> 25:31.073
What did you do?

25:35.077 --> 25:36.954
I didn't do anything, Mrs. Turner.

25:39.373 --> 25:40.791
It was just an accident.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.128
You know how accidents can happen.

25:48.465 --> 25:50.050
It's just you and me now.
