Stand up, Richie.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.561

Get up there.

The future CEO of our company,
right here.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.238
Right here.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.509
I was in labor
for 30 hours with Richie.

08:30.511 --> 08:33.278
He didn't wanna come out.
He had it made in there.

08:33.280 --> 08:36.648
Thirty hours.
And then, he was born blue.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.149
- Blue?
- Slate blue.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.484
We all thought he was dead

08:39.486 --> 08:42.721
but then he started
breathing and crawling.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.356
And sucking on the cat's tail.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.658
- What?
- Yes. Yes.

08:46.660 --> 08:50.428
Uh, apparently, I prefer
the cat's tail to my pacifier.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.631
The cat's tail was always wet.

08:52.633 --> 08:55.066
<i> You know, Hunter</i>
<i> was a crazy kid, too.</i>

08:55.068 --> 08:57.435

- That's not --

09:03.877 --> 09:05.710
<i> Come on.</i>

09:05.712 --> 09:07.012
<i> - This is great.</i>
- Ha-ha-ha!

09:07.014 --> 09:09.281
It's not really a story.

09:12.119 --> 09:15.086
Um, there was this guy

09:15.088 --> 09:18.189
kind of this local nutcase

09:18.191 --> 09:20.559
and he would stand
on the side of the road

09:20.561 --> 09:22.394
into town and he would
blow kisses

09:22.396 --> 09:25.096
at all the cars passing by.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.431
And at first, he scared me

09:26.433 --> 09:30.535
because he had this beard

09:30.537 --> 09:34.272
and dirty hair and bad teeth.

09:34.274 --> 09:37.509
Uh, it was like this
religious calling or something.

09:37.511 --> 09:39.377
- He had to blow --
- Oh, by the way, Richie..

09:39.379 --> 09:43.481
Uh, before I forget, um, how was
it left with the Carver people?

09:43.483 --> 09:47.085
They sent over the contracts
and it's being e-signed

09:47.087 --> 09:49.287
because one of the partners
is in Africa

09:49.289 --> 09:51.022

- Okay. Good.
- I'll get right on it.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.065
He's on safari. No, really.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.567
Oh, oh, well,

10:35.569 --> 10:36.968
- No, I mean it. I mean it.
- I know.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.236
- Okay, fine.
- But he's, I mean, he's out..

11:32.426 --> 11:35.427

- Obviously.

11:35.429 --> 11:38.630
I just wanted
to bring this over.

11:38.632 --> 11:40.665
Self-help book.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.500
I read it when I was pregnant

11:42.502 --> 11:46.337
and it really helped
with the postpartum.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.874
Oh, my gosh.
I love it.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.178

<i> No, no, no. Don't bother.</i>
<i> I better be going.</i>

12:05.625 --> 12:08.560
You would look
so pretty with long hair.

I chose sky blue drapes
for the theater.

Oh. Cool.

15:08.174 --> 15:10.675
That's not so unexpected.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.176
You sure that's
the right color, though?

15:12.178 --> 15:14.178
It's a little hipster.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.515
I think it works.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.950
And you said
that I could choose.

I did. And you can.
Of course you can.

About what? The drapes?

15:42.208 --> 15:43.808
I don't know.

15:43.810 --> 15:46.511

I'm not doing anything wrong.

15:46.513 --> 15:47.912

the medication?

37:27.946 --> 37:30.847
We can try Celexa
or -- or Wellbutrin. Sure.

37:30.849 --> 37:33.883
But talking is important, too.

37:33.885 --> 37:36.152
Are you reluctant to talk
about your parents?

37:36.154 --> 37:38.355
It's just a waste of time.

37:39.858 --> 37:41.992

You see, your brain
and your body are connected.

39:02.307 --> 39:04.374
But right now,
your body's starving

39:04.376 --> 39:06.676
so it is sending the wrong
signal to the brain

39:06.678 --> 39:09.079
about what it wants to eat.

39:09.081 --> 39:12.816
So we are going to reconnect

He's a nurse.
A live-in nurse.

He's great with memaw.
Very sensitive.

40:16.014 --> 40:18.181
I'm not a senior citizen.

40:20.318 --> 40:24.921
Look, I gotta work.
I can't be here 24/7.

40:26.291 --> 40:28.825
So he's here
to keep an eye on me?

40:28.827 --> 40:31.227
No, he's here as a resource.

40:31.229 --> 40:33.430
If you're tired,
he can cook for you.

40:33.432 --> 40:35.398
He can go to the store
and get you things.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.534
What, is he gonna be
pulling stuff out of my hands?

40:37.536 --> 40:41.104
Okay, okay.
Just relax, babe, okay?

40:41.106 --> 40:43.807
Mom? Mom, can you come
and explain this, please?

40:43.809 --> 40:48.411
This was your idea and
I just...can't deal with this
right now.

40:48.413 --> 40:52.549
You know, I had help
around the house
when I was pregnant.

40:52.551 --> 40:54.918
It really takes
the pressure off.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.286
Plus, you're still recovering

40:56.288 --> 40:58.822
from your little stay
in the hospital.

40:58.824 --> 41:02.358
Honey, Luay is the best
there is.

42:24.576 --> 42:26.609
No war there.

42:26.611 --> 42:29.746
Just trees and cows
and farms and stuff.

42:29.748 --> 42:33.683
If you were in war,
you would not have this problem
of the mind.

42:36.354 --> 42:39.722
No time for mind problems
when you're being shot at.

42:50.602 --> 42:53.236
I have to go
to the bathroom now.

42:54.172 --> 42:56.105
Please, miss.

42:57.075 --> 42:58.408
You know what they want, okay?

42:58.410 --> 43:00.777
You know
what I'm supposed to do.

43:21.666 --> 43:23.800
Okay, go.

44:17.889 --> 44:20.123

44:20.125 --> 44:25.495
The hospital sent over a report
detailing the contents
of your stomach.

44:25.497 --> 44:27.730
It said you swallowed a battery.

44:31.970 --> 44:33.903
[sighs]

44:36.007 --> 44:39.308
It's just so not a big deal.

44:40.578 --> 44:42.612
Everyone is making
a big deal about it.

44:46.518 --> 44:50.353
Yes, I did some things
that I shouldn't have.

44:52.190 --> 44:55.491
Well, a battery seems like
a big deal.

44:56.528 --> 44:57.927
If it leaked inside your stomach

44:57.929 --> 44:59.362
the acid could've killed you.

44:59.364 --> 45:01.564
<i> That concerns me.</i>

45:05.003 --> 45:09.472
A needle, a rock, a battery.

45:09.474 --> 45:11.841
Why those objects?

45:11.843 --> 45:13.976
I don't know.

45:13.978 --> 45:15.945
It made me feel..

45:17.315 --> 45:19.515
...in control.

45:19.517 --> 45:21.884
Do you feel out of control?

45:25.223 --> 45:27.890
Oh, um, there was something

45:27.892 --> 45:32.295
that I wanted
to tell you about, um..

45:32.297 --> 45:35.965
...my mom and our relationship
and stuff.

45:39.704 --> 45:42.138
You know what?
Never mind.

45:42.140 --> 45:44.440
Hunter.

45:44.442 --> 45:47.810
It's Richie's birthday.
I really have to go.

45:47.812 --> 45:49.479
Bye.

45:49.481 --> 45:52.415
- Hi, birthday boy.
- Hi, babe.

45:52.417 --> 45:54.851
- Hi, Hunter. Great party.
- Hi, Sara. How are you?

45:54.853 --> 45:56.552
Great party.

45:56.554 --> 45:58.488
- Hi, Lauren.
- Hi.

45:59.691 --> 46:01.657
- I love your dress.
- Hunter..

46:01.659 --> 46:04.360
I love what you've done
with the place.

46:04.362 --> 46:07.663
Look at these sandwiches.
They're hilarious.

46:07.665 --> 46:10.600
- Have one.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Get those away from me.

46:10.602 --> 46:14.003
If I eat anymore I'm gonna
have to get my stomach pumped.

46:16.241 --> 46:17.807
Oh, my God. Hunter.

46:17.809 --> 46:19.876
Sweetie, I'm so sorry.
I didn't..

46:19.878 --> 46:21.344
- I'm such an idiot. I didn't..
- What?

46:21.346 --> 46:22.979
I wasn't even thinking,
and I just --

46:22.981 --> 46:24.280
No, no, no. Bev, Bev.

46:24.282 --> 46:25.615
Don't even, don't even
worry about it.

46:25.617 --> 46:27.884
It's fine. It's fine.
Really, it's okay.

46:27.886 --> 46:30.787
And we're doing great.

46:30.789 --> 46:35.057
Yeah, H -- Hunter's made
a lot of progress, and..

46:35.059 --> 46:37.293
- Right.
- Uh..

46:37.295 --> 46:39.328
My mom's got her on a new diet.

46:39.330 --> 46:42.565
- Right?
- Mm. What diet?

46:42.567 --> 46:44.000
Oh.

46:45.136 --> 46:49.972
Lots of...iron and fiber.

46:49.974 --> 46:53.075
- Mm. That's so healthy.
- And fish and --

46:53.077 --> 46:54.410
- Right.
- Right, right. Yeah.

46:54.412 --> 46:56.412
- You look great.
-<i> Doesn't she?</i>

46:56.414 --> 46:57.513
- I know. I love diets.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

46:57.515 --> 46:59.315
She made all my favorites.

47:00.385 --> 47:02.285
Yeah.

47:02.287 --> 47:04.520
I'd rather no one know.

47:05.690 --> 47:09.759
Well..
Are you mad at me?

47:09.761 --> 47:13.863
Hon, e -- everybody here cares.
They care big time.

47:13.865 --> 47:17.266
Y -- your food's a big hit.
It's a huge hit.

47:17.268 --> 47:19.068
You should be happy about that.

47:19.070 --> 47:20.803
Yeah.

47:20.805 --> 47:22.738
I can't believe
you fucking told them.

47:22.740 --> 47:25.208
Okay, can you please
not ruin my birthday?

47:25.210 --> 47:27.443
We'll talk about this later.

47:31.482 --> 47:34.317
[indistinct chatter]

47:34.319 --> 47:35.718
[sighs]

47:37.889 --> 47:39.956
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:39.958 --> 47:41.924
Can I, uh..

47:41.926 --> 47:43.492
Can I have a hug?

47:44.295 --> 47:46.062
<i> I'm lonely.</i>

47:47.966 --> 47:49.465

[instrumental music]

48:05.250 --> 48:07.116
Are you okay, miss?

48:07.118 --> 48:08.951
Yes, thank you.

48:08.953 --> 48:10.419
<i> Okay.</i>

48:10.421 --> 48:12.855
<i> Let me know</i>
<i> if you need anything.</i>

48:18.263 --> 48:20.630
I -- I'll be right outside.

[breathing heavily]

50:02.467 --> 50:04.633
I didn't finish.

50:09.774 --> 50:12.208
Say you're sorry..

50:14.712 --> 50:17.046
...for the party..

50:17.048 --> 50:18.981
...telling everyone
at the office.

50:20.184 --> 50:24.153
I'm sorry. I am, honey.

50:26.057 --> 50:29.825
This hasn't been easy on me,
either.

50:29.827 --> 50:32.061
I needed the support.

50:33.631 --> 50:36.198
Do you still love me
unconditionally?

50:38.469 --> 50:39.869
Of course.

50:41.472 --> 50:43.339
Yes.

50:43.341 --> 50:45.474
Yes, I do.

50:45.476 --> 50:48.277
And I'm gonna try harder
to understand

50:48.279 --> 50:50.746
to be more understanding.

50:54.419 --> 50:55.951
Okay.

50:58.689 --> 51:00.723
I love you too.

51:02.860 --> 51:05.161
I'm sorry I'm such a freak.

51:06.230 --> 51:08.531
But you're my freak.

51:08.533 --> 51:10.833
You're my little freak.

51:37.128 --> 51:40.329
Let's get back to your family
for a minute.

51:40.331 --> 51:41.931
Why?

51:43.234 --> 51:44.467
[chuckles]

51:44.469 --> 51:45.801
I told you they were normal.

51:45.803 --> 51:49.305
In last session,
you hinted at some type of

51:49.307 --> 51:51.707
issue with your mom.

51:58.082 --> 52:01.083
Oh, gosh.

52:02.887 --> 52:05.821
I guess you want me to tell you
about the whole rape thing.

52:05.823 --> 52:08.324
What whole rape thing?

52:08.326 --> 52:10.392
Okay.

52:10.394 --> 52:14.230
If I tell you...if..

52:14.232 --> 52:18.300
...you have to promise
that you're not gonna make
a big deal about it.

52:18.302 --> 52:20.069
I promise.

52:22.940 --> 52:27.209
So my father
isn't really my father.

52:27.211 --> 52:32.081
My mom was raped in the '90s
by some random guy

52:32.083 --> 52:34.750
and I was the result,
you know?

52:38.456 --> 52:40.756
Did they ever catch the guy?

52:40.758 --> 52:43.792
Yeah. He did time.

52:45.763 --> 52:48.397
William Erwin was his name

52:48.399 --> 52:50.299
is his name.

52:51.269 --> 52:53.869
Do you wanna see
a picture of him?

52:53.871 --> 52:56.238
<i> Oh, no. Not really.</i>

52:57.408 --> 52:59.041
<i> No, look.</i>

53:00.011 --> 53:01.310
Look.

53:02.547 --> 53:04.480
That's him.

53:04.482 --> 53:07.149
<i> Y -- you carry that around</i>
<i> with you?</i>

53:07.151 --> 53:08.717
Yeah.

53:11.455 --> 53:12.988
I've dealt with it.

53:13.858 --> 53:16.392
<i> How have you dealt with it?</i>

53:18.029 --> 53:20.696
I've thought about it a lot.

53:20.698 --> 53:25.100
Did your mother ever consider
terminating the pregnancy?

53:25.102 --> 53:30.439
My mom is...this right-wing
religious nut.

53:32.276 --> 53:34.009
She's really sweet.

53:35.146 --> 53:39.481
My family doesn't believe in..

53:39.483 --> 53:41.917
...abortion even in the cases

53:41.919 --> 53:45.221
of incest or rape

53:45.223 --> 53:49.325
so here I am.

53:55.833 --> 53:59.201
But my stepdad
was really nice to me.

53:59.203 --> 54:02.905
And my mom was never
resentful or anything.

54:04.642 --> 54:06.508
My sisters love me.

54:12.717 --> 54:14.917
[sighing]

54:17.888 --> 54:19.922
How did it happen?

54:24.028 --> 54:28.998
She went to a bar
and he bought her a drink.

54:31.302 --> 54:33.936
My mom left

54:33.938 --> 54:38.540
and he followed her home

54:38.542 --> 54:40.442
and he broke in.

54:42.413 --> 54:44.046
That's all I know.

54:48.085 --> 54:50.319
Can we change the subject?

54:50.321 --> 54:53.622
I think this is important,
actually.

54:53.624 --> 54:56.992
I think this might have a lot
to do with your compulsion.

54:58.629 --> 55:00.062
Okay.

55:01.699 --> 55:03.098
[timer beeping]

55:04.135 --> 55:06.535
We're at the end of our session.

55:16.814 --> 55:18.814
See you in a couple days.

55:20.918 --> 55:23.352
That color looks
really nice on you.

55:23.354 --> 55:25.421
Oh, thank you.

55:37.668 --> 55:39.368
See you soon.

55:47.978 --> 55:50.579
[exhales]

55:52.383 --> 55:53.949
I love you.

55:55.619 --> 55:57.920
I love you too.

55:59.690 --> 56:01.090
Mm.

57:13.063 --> 57:15.597
What do you mean
about her past?

57:22.406 --> 57:25.307
<i> I -- I think</i>
<i> her life is in danger.</i>

57:25.309 --> 57:27.376
<i> She can't overcome</i>

<i> without your love</i>

57:29.847 --> 57:32.381
No, no, no, no.
What about her past?

57:32.383 --> 57:33.982
Please, you have to tell me.

57:33.984 --> 57:36.318
<i> I can't say.</i>
<i> Just ask her.</i>

57:36.320 --> 57:38.353
<i> Listen, we had a deal, okay?</i>

57:38.355 --> 57:40.689
<i> You're supposed to tell me</i>

57:40.691 --> 57:42.257
<i> Everything.</i>

57:44.161 --> 57:47.729
<i> If you won't tell me,</i>
<i> I don't want her</i>
<i> seeing you anymore.</i>

57:51.035 --> 57:53.502
It has to do with a rape.

57:56.273 --> 57:57.673

57:59.677 --> 58:01.343
<i> Are you there?</i>

<i> So as I understand</i>

58:10.554 --> 58:13.422
<i> Hunter's father</i>

58:13.424 --> 58:16.892

You remember Jill McCoy, right?

1:21:57.580 --> 1:21:59.713
She's my mom.

1:22:02.184 --> 1:22:04.618
Lucy, do you have
a recycling bin or something?

1:22:04.620 --> 1:22:09.189
Oh, yeah. I'll take those.
It's under the sink.

1:22:09.191 --> 1:22:11.558
I'm sorry. Jill who?

1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:13.827
- McCoy.
- She's an old friend of mine.

1:22:13.829 --> 1:22:16.130
I.. Well, I haven't seen her
in years.

1:22:16.132 --> 1:22:21.402
Hey, Brat. Why don't you go
and play with your pals.

1:22:21.404 --> 1:22:23.904
Oh, you never mentioned
any Jill.

1:22:23.906 --> 1:22:25.539
Oh, uh..

1:22:25.541 --> 1:22:28.742
- Jill.
- Oh! Yeah. She, uh, she..

1:22:28.744 --> 1:22:33.013
I, her mom,
I went to high school with her.

1:22:33.015 --> 1:22:35.883
Yeah. Coming back to me now.
I ran into Jill last week.

1:22:35.885 --> 1:22:40.187
She said that her daughter,
uh, might

1:22:40.189 --> 1:22:42.323
you know, stop by the party.

1:22:42.325 --> 1:22:45.626
Or rather,
she and her daughter.

1:22:45.628 --> 1:22:47.294
So I guess your mom
couldn't make it, huh?

1:22:47.296 --> 1:22:48.529
No.

1:22:48.531 --> 1:22:50.564
No, she got held up.

1:22:51.534 --> 1:22:54.201
So, so, what do you want?

1:22:54.203 --> 1:22:57.137
Um, soda? You want p -- punch?

1:22:59.208 --> 1:23:01.608
I don't know.

1:23:01.610 --> 1:23:04.478
I haven't decided yet.

1:23:04.480 --> 1:23:06.547
Can I show Hunter my room?

1:23:06.549 --> 1:23:08.248
No. No, honey.

1:23:08.250 --> 1:23:09.984
You gotta go to bed.
It's past your bedtime.

1:23:09.986 --> 1:23:11.552
Mm-hm.

1:23:11.554 --> 1:23:13.387
Oh, come on. Here.

1:23:13.389 --> 1:23:15.656
<i> And you're in charge</i>
<i> of the grill, okay?</i>

1:23:15.658 --> 1:23:18.425
- Okay. Yeah. Alright.
- We need burgers and hot dogs.

1:23:18.427 --> 1:23:20.794
Okay. Sure, babe.

1:23:36.212 --> 1:23:37.578
So..

1:23:40.483 --> 1:23:43.851
...are you gonna ruin my life
or what?

1:23:43.853 --> 1:23:46.687
<i> I haven't decided yet.</i>

1:23:46.689 --> 1:23:49.189
<i> I guess I should, right?</i>

1:23:55.965 --> 1:23:59.400
- Don't touch me!
-<i> Keep your voice down.</i>

1:23:59.402 --> 1:24:02.669
I will do whatever the fuck
I want!

1:24:02.671 --> 1:24:05.272
I make the rules here.

1:24:05.274 --> 1:24:08.342
I'm in charge, okay?

1:24:08.344 --> 1:24:09.810
Say it.

1:24:11.881 --> 1:24:13.247
Say it.

1:24:13.249 --> 1:24:16.250
[chuckles]

1:24:16.252 --> 1:24:19.653
Okay. You're in charge.

1:24:19.655 --> 1:24:22.322
Hey, where are those burgers?
We're famished.

1:24:22.324 --> 1:24:24.992
Roger that!

1:24:24.994 --> 1:24:26.460
- Join us outside, kids.
- Yeah.

1:24:26.462 --> 1:24:28.128
No, we'll be there in a minute.
We're just.. Just..

1:24:28.130 --> 1:24:30.431
- Can you give us a minute?
- Okay.

1:24:30.433 --> 1:24:32.299
Okay. We're good.

1:24:41.577 --> 1:24:43.744
Why'd you do it?

1:24:43.746 --> 1:24:46.947
I can't explain that.
That's..

1:24:49.985 --> 1:24:52.386
I was delusional. I mean,
there's no way to explain that.

1:24:52.388 --> 1:24:54.188
I -- I was..

1:24:56.358 --> 1:24:57.758
[Hunter chuckles]

1:24:58.594 --> 1:25:00.127
It made me feel special.

1:25:00.129 --> 1:25:01.595
[scoffs]

1:25:02.731 --> 1:25:06.433
A secret makes you strong,
you know?

1:25:06.435 --> 1:25:09.536
Everybody thought I was
this regular guy, you know

1:25:09.538 --> 1:25:11.738
but I was important inside.

1:25:11.740 --> 1:25:14.274
I was fucking powerful.

1:25:14.276 --> 1:25:16.276
I was God.

1:25:21.650 --> 1:25:23.650
[chuckles]

1:25:23.652 --> 1:25:25.786
And, um..

1:25:27.389 --> 1:25:29.022
...and then I went to jail

1:25:29.024 --> 1:25:34.528
and I got shit-bagged in jail.

1:25:34.530 --> 1:25:38.932
Yeah, they beat me so bad
I had to wear a colostomy bag

1:25:38.934 --> 1:25:42.136
and then I realized who I was.

1:25:42.138 --> 1:25:44.138
I was not God.

1:25:46.075 --> 1:25:48.342
I was shit.

1:25:59.989 --> 1:26:02.756
Are you ashamed of me?

1:26:05.961 --> 1:26:07.261
No.

1:26:08.631 --> 1:26:10.831
But what I did..

1:26:14.670 --> 1:26:16.870
...I'm ashamed of that.

1:26:23.212 --> 1:26:24.344
[sniffles]

1:26:25.781 --> 1:26:28.315
Am I like you?

1:26:34.590 --> 1:26:36.290
I don't know.

1:26:37.993 --> 1:26:39.226
Are you?

1:26:41.564 --> 1:26:43.096
No.

1:26:44.767 --> 1:26:48.101
But I just need to
hear you say it.

1:26:53.842 --> 1:26:56.043
You're not me.

1:26:59.081 --> 1:27:00.280
You..

1:27:01.650 --> 1:27:03.850
You didn't do anything.

1:27:05.154 --> 1:27:07.354
You didn't do anything wrong.

1:27:08.524 --> 1:27:11.024
It's not your fault.

1:27:19.535 --> 1:27:21.568
<i> Take one pill here</i>

1:27:21.570 --> 1:27:23.403

1:27:23.405 --> 1:27:25.706
<i> ...then place the remaining</i>
<i> four pills in your mouth</i>

1:27:25.708 --> 1:27:27.574
<i> two in each cheek.</i>

1:27:27.576 --> 1:27:31.211
Wait for them to dissolve,
then swallow the remnants.
