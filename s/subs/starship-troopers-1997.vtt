00:38.730 --> 00:40.560
Young people from all over the globe...

00:40.650 --> 00:42.730
are joining up
to fight for the future.

00:42.820 --> 00:45.690
- I'm doing my part.
- I'm doing my part.

00:45.730 --> 00:49.360
- I'm doing my part.
- I'm doing my part too.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.450
They're doing their part,
are you?

00:53.530 --> 00:56.040
Join the Mobile Infantry
and save the world.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.620
Service guarantees citizenship.

01:02.540 --> 01:05.590
The bugs send
another meteor our way...

01:05.670 --> 01:07.510
but this time we're ready.

01:07.550 --> 01:11.010
Planetary defences
are better than ever.

01:15.640 --> 01:18.230
Klendathu, source
of the bug meteor attacks...

01:18.310 --> 01:21.770
orbits a twin star system whose
brutal gravitational forces...

01:21.810 --> 01:24.860
produce an unlimited supply
of bug meteorites...

01:24.940 --> 01:27.610
in the form
of this asteroid belt.

01:27.650 --> 01:29.900
To ensure the safety
of our solar system...

01:29.990 --> 01:32.490
Klendathu must be eliminated.

01:33.990 --> 01:36.790
We break net now and take you
live to Klendathu...

01:36.830 --> 01:39.620
where the invasion has begun.

01:39.660 --> 01:43.130
EXQ uplink on two, one.
You're on.

01:43.170 --> 01:45.811
- We've just landed here on what cap troopers...
- Move, move, move!

01:45.840 --> 01:47.920
...are calling Big K,
- Come on! Move, move!

01:48.010 --> 01:50.590
...with the 6th Mobile Infantry Division!
- Come on!

01:50.670 --> 01:53.970
It's an ugly planet,
a bug planet!

01:54.010 --> 01:56.760
A planet hostile to life
as we know it!

02:00.180 --> 02:01.600
Help me!

02:12.610 --> 02:15.450
- Come on! Go, go, go!
- Keep moving!

02:15.490 --> 02:17.160
Get out of here now!

02:26.500 --> 02:28.130
Kitten, no!

02:38.680 --> 02:40.100
Oh, God!

02:41.100 --> 02:42.310
Oh, God!

02:57.370 --> 03:02.200
Rico. Rico. Rico!

03:05.500 --> 03:07.420
Pay attention.

03:08.210 --> 03:10.210
Sorry, Mr Rasczak.

03:10.250 --> 03:12.340
Let's sum up.

03:12.380 --> 03:15.220
This year we explored
the failure of democracy...

03:15.260 --> 03:17.090
- Bad boy... how the social
scientists brought our world...

03:17.140 --> 03:18.970
to the brink of chaos.

03:19.050 --> 03:21.850
We talked about the veterans,
how they took control...

03:21.890 --> 03:26.230
and imposed the stability
that has lasted for generations since.

03:26.270 --> 03:28.110
You know these facts...

03:28.150 --> 03:30.480
but have I taught you anything
of value this year?

03:30.570 --> 03:32.150
Hmm?

03:32.190 --> 03:34.190
You. Why are only citizens
allowed to vote?

03:34.240 --> 03:35.780
It's a reward,

03:35.820 --> 03:38.620
what the Federation gives you
for doing Federal Service.

03:38.660 --> 03:40.830
No. No.

03:40.910 --> 03:44.460
Something given has no value.

03:44.500 --> 03:47.790
Look, when you vote, you are
exercising political authority.

03:47.880 --> 03:51.840
You're using force. And force,
my friends, is violence,

03:51.920 --> 03:55.800
the supreme authority from which
all other authority is derived.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.970
Uh, my mother always said
violence never solves anything.

03:59.010 --> 04:00.550
Really?

04:00.600 --> 04:04.060
I wonder what the city fathers
of Hiroshima would say about that.

04:04.140 --> 04:05.980
You.

04:06.060 --> 04:09.940
They probably wouldn't say anything.
Hiroshima was destroyed.

04:10.020 --> 04:11.400
Correct.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.610
Naked force has resolved
more issues...

04:13.690 --> 04:16.279
throughout history
than any other factor.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.779
The contrary opinion, that
violence never solves anything,

04:19.870 --> 04:22.200
is wishful thinking
at its worst.

04:22.240 --> 04:25.450
People who forget that
always pay.

04:25.500 --> 04:29.120
Rico, what's the moral
difference, if any...

04:29.170 --> 04:31.170
between a civilian
and a citizen?

04:31.210 --> 04:34.250
A citizen accepts personal
responsibility for the safety...

04:34.340 --> 04:37.630
of the body politic,
defending it with his life.

04:37.720 --> 04:41.850
- A civilian does not.
- The exact words of the text.

04:41.890 --> 04:44.720
But do you understand it?
Do you believe it?

04:45.970 --> 04:48.980
- I don't know.
- Of course you don't.

04:49.020 --> 04:51.100
I doubt anyone here would
recognize civic virtue...

04:51.190 --> 04:53.020
if it reached up
and bit you in the ass.

05:11.080 --> 05:12.920
Not here.

05:12.960 --> 05:15.130
Come on, let's see if they
posted the math final.

05:15.170 --> 05:18.470
- Rico, we gonna take Tesla?
- We're gonna kill 'em.

05:21.340 --> 05:24.140
Remember, all graduating seniors
must fill out a 710 form.

05:24.180 --> 05:26.600
First thing Fleet Academy
looks at is your math scores.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.100
Wish me luck.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.490
- Way to go.
- Good job.

05:38.530 --> 05:40.780
Your turn.
Hold on.

05:40.820 --> 05:43.410
I want to talk to Marco.
His sister's at Fleet.

05:43.490 --> 05:45.330
- Marco.
- Hi, Carmen.

05:45.410 --> 05:47.910
- What do you hear about Roxy?
- She made pilot.

05:48.000 --> 05:51.000
- She did?
- Oh, yeah.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.540
Thirty-five percent.
Very nice.

05:55.290 --> 05:59.970
Look at that. Thirty-five
percent, ladies and gentlemen.

06:00.050 --> 06:01.340
Big numbers.

06:01.430 --> 06:03.340
- Carl.
- Sorry.

06:10.270 --> 06:12.850
So, you haven't done it yet,
have you? Don't lie.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.690
I'm not in any hurry.

06:16.060 --> 06:17.900
- Others are waiting.
- And?

06:19.360 --> 06:21.200
- Did you read her mind?
- Don't have to.

06:21.240 --> 06:23.490
It's pretty clear
what she wants.

06:23.570 --> 06:25.990
Yeah, but I want Carmen.

06:26.070 --> 06:28.240
- Aw, you got it bad.
- Bye, Marco.

06:28.330 --> 06:29.750
Hey, don't forget about
this afternoon.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.460
He's always late when he walks
you home to fish for a kiss.

06:32.500 --> 06:34.500
Get out of here.

06:34.580 --> 06:37.800
- Marco's sister made pilot.
- So will you.

06:37.880 --> 06:42.050
I mean, imagine flying a half
a million tons of starship.

06:42.090 --> 06:43.760
You gotta have nerves of steel.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.390
Yeah, you do. Let's see
how yours hold up.

06:46.430 --> 06:47.640
You may begin.

06:58.860 --> 07:01.740
Aw, come on, it's just a bug.
You better put your goggles on.

07:01.780 --> 07:03.280
"Just a bug."

07:03.320 --> 07:07.410
We humans like to think we are
nature's finest achievement.

07:07.450 --> 07:09.700
I'm afraid it just isn't true.

07:09.790 --> 07:14.290
This Arkellian sand beetle
is superior in many ways.

07:14.330 --> 07:19.090
It reproduces in vast
numbers, has no ego...

07:19.130 --> 07:23.220
has no fear, doesn't
now about death...

07:23.260 --> 07:27.140
and so is the perfect
selfless member of society.

07:27.220 --> 07:29.720
But humans have created
art, mathematics...

07:29.810 --> 07:32.470
and interstellar travel.

07:32.520 --> 07:35.560
True. But before you
let that go to your head...

07:35.600 --> 07:37.940
take the example
of the Arachnids...

07:38.020 --> 07:41.320
a highly evolved
insect society.

07:41.360 --> 07:44.400
By human standards,
they are relatively stupid...

07:44.450 --> 07:48.530
but their evolution stretches
over millions of years...

07:49.780 --> 07:51.080
- and now...
- Here, take this.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.580
...they can
colonize planets...

07:53.660 --> 07:56.620
by hurling their spore
into space.

07:56.670 --> 07:58.920
Okay, I think we got it.

07:59.000 --> 08:00.380
That's the heart.

08:02.000 --> 08:03.760
And here's the stomach.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.430
Nerves of steel, huh?

08:15.810 --> 08:18.650
Don't think about it.
Just go on instinct.

08:18.690 --> 08:20.520
Try to visualize it.

08:34.909 --> 08:37.409
I see the ace of spades.

08:41.750 --> 08:43.049
You know,
statistically speaking,

08:43.090 --> 08:45.960
you should have accidentally
guessed right by now.

08:46.010 --> 08:50.840
- Try another.
- So my psychic abilities are zero and I'm unlucky.

08:50.930 --> 08:53.010
No, luck's not a factor.

08:53.060 --> 08:55.970
No one really knows why some people
are sensitive and some aren't.

08:56.020 --> 08:59.140
Who knows? Maybe it's a new
stage of human evolution.

08:59.230 --> 09:02.110
That's why they do these
kind of Federal studies.

09:02.150 --> 09:05.190
What... Cyrano...
Oh, shit. Time out.

09:05.280 --> 09:06.690
Oh, he just wants
some attention.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.400
You don't play
with him any more.

09:08.450 --> 09:09.660
Cyrano.

09:12.070 --> 09:14.910
Go bug Mom, Cyrano.

09:24.460 --> 09:26.550
How do you make him do that?

09:26.590 --> 09:30.050
Oh, I gave him the impression
there's a grub crawling up my mom's leg.

09:30.090 --> 09:31.840
He's on a mission to go eat it.

09:31.930 --> 09:37.600
Ow! Oh! Get out!
Get off my leg! Oh! Carl!

09:39.690 --> 09:41.770
I sure hope you don't do
anything like that to me.

09:41.850 --> 09:46.860
Don't be afraid.
Can't do human. Yet.

09:46.900 --> 09:48.900
Yeah!

09:54.410 --> 09:56.160
All right!

10:02.290 --> 10:06.090
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Touchdown Tigers.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.590
And the score
is now 41-38.

10:08.670 --> 10:10.760
Tigers lead
with 2...46 remaining...

10:10.840 --> 10:13.010
here at the Buenos Aires
Sports Arena.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.550
Time out Giants.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.220
- Are you all right?
- Much better.

10:18.310 --> 10:19.730
- Now. Good.
- Yeah!

10:19.770 --> 10:22.350
All right!
Way to go, team!

10:22.440 --> 10:24.190
Hey! Your helmet.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.900
So, what are you doing
after the game?

10:29.780 --> 10:32.650
Well, everyone's going
to the dance, aren't you?

10:32.700 --> 10:35.280
I don't know. It's my
last night as a civilian.

10:35.370 --> 10:38.011
- Come on, number 12! Let's go!
- Ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.

10:38.040 --> 10:41.750
- You're going to the Fleet Academy?
- Uh-huh.

10:41.830 --> 10:43.250
That's where I want to go!

10:43.290 --> 10:45.960
Come on, number 12!
Let's play ball!

10:46.000 --> 10:47.750
Don't get any ideas
about my girlfriend!

10:51.630 --> 10:54.640
All is fair in love and war.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.890
- Giants! Giants!
- Johnny! Yeah!

10:57.970 --> 10:59.260
Hut! Hut!

11:11.490 --> 11:13.150
Hey, yeah!

11:13.200 --> 11:16.990
Giants leading 43-41.
Just over 42 seconds remaining.

11:20.790 --> 11:22.080
- Yeah!
- All right, let's go.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.080
Irvin, Lathom, cover the rush.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.210
Perry, fake left.
Bertolli, you go long.

11:27.250 --> 11:31.670
Rico, flip six three hole.
Got it? Hey, Rico?

11:31.710 --> 11:34.130
- Hey!
- What?

11:34.170 --> 11:37.800
You're drifting! Flip six,
three hole, on one! Got it?

11:37.850 --> 11:41.140
- Just throw me the ball, Diz.
- Ready? Break!

11:41.220 --> 11:42.520
Break!

11:43.850 --> 11:47.310
Down. Set.
Tight left.

11:47.350 --> 11:49.360
- Screen!
- Hut!

12:01.240 --> 12:04.290
Yeah! Go, go, go!

12:06.420 --> 12:08.420
All right!

12:11.550 --> 12:13.800
Yeah!

12:13.880 --> 12:16.380
He's in there.
It's over.

12:32.480 --> 12:34.820
Who said you could
grow up so fast, huh?

12:34.860 --> 12:36.950
Mom, don't get mushy.

12:38.860 --> 12:40.870
This came for you today.

12:40.950 --> 12:42.870
I presume, at your request.

12:46.580 --> 12:48.750
A lot of my friends are
doing Federal Service.

12:48.790 --> 12:51.290
Well, you're not
thinking of applying?

12:51.340 --> 12:53.420
Have you lost your mind?

12:53.460 --> 12:56.670
I'd rather take ten lashes in Public
Square than see you ruin your life.

12:56.760 --> 12:59.010
It's a term of service.

12:59.090 --> 13:01.010
It's not a career.

13:01.090 --> 13:03.260
I just want to get
out on my own...

13:04.770 --> 13:07.180
see the galaxy
for a couple years.

13:07.270 --> 13:09.690
Johnny, people get killed
in the Federal Service.

13:09.770 --> 13:13.480
Who gave you this idea?
It's that teacher, isn't it?

13:13.570 --> 13:16.530
What's his name? You know
the one I'm talking about.

13:17.610 --> 13:20.740
- Mr Rasczak.
- Rasczak?

13:22.780 --> 13:25.040
Silly name. There should
be a law against...

13:25.120 --> 13:27.290
using a school
as a recruiting station.

13:27.370 --> 13:31.790
No, Rasczak doesn't do that
at all.

13:31.830 --> 13:33.920
He sort of discourages you.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.840
Well, that's good.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.920
'Cause you're going to Harvard,
and that's the end of it.

13:39.010 --> 13:41.510
It's my decision, not yours.

13:41.590 --> 13:44.260
- Oh, is that how it is, huh?
- Wait, you two.

13:44.300 --> 13:47.770
Uh, Dad and I have a surprise
for you that will settle this.

13:47.850 --> 13:50.350
Can you guess what it is?

13:50.390 --> 13:51.770
No.

13:52.900 --> 13:54.650
You wanted to see the galaxy?

13:55.900 --> 13:58.940
How about a trip
to the Outer Rings?

13:58.990 --> 14:01.950
Zegema Beach. Huh?

14:04.450 --> 14:06.080
I've always wanted to go there.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.700
Good, good.
Then it's all settled.

14:25.680 --> 14:28.020
Sure. Don't go away.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.020
I'm just gonna
go see Mr Rasczak.

14:32.060 --> 14:34.150
Hey, Rico, do you
want to dance?

14:34.190 --> 14:35.810
Actually, Diz,
I promised Carmen...

14:35.860 --> 14:37.860
Aw, come on. Too bad for her
if she's not around.

14:41.570 --> 14:44.360
You know, it's sad.
After tonight, most of us...

14:44.410 --> 14:46.330
probably won't
see each other again.

14:49.910 --> 14:52.000
So, you still
gonna play for Rio?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.500
Yeah, looks like.
Unless Tokyo lets me start.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.800
Well, anyone
who gets you is lucky.

15:00.170 --> 15:02.880
Johnny, how come
we never got together?

15:06.850 --> 15:08.850
Can't we just be friends, Diz?

15:11.520 --> 15:12.940
Sure.

15:16.610 --> 15:18.520
- Thank you.
- Good night.

15:18.610 --> 15:22.320
Look, Diz, I want to talk
to Mr Rasczak.

15:24.740 --> 15:27.160
Well, you better hurry up
if you want to catch him.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.620
You're the best.

15:41.760 --> 15:43.380
Mr Rasczak!

15:43.420 --> 15:46.430
- What is it, Rico?
- I want to thank you.

15:46.470 --> 15:49.050
Your class was the best one
I had this year.

15:49.140 --> 15:51.720
Well, it's really not my job to please.
I just hope you learned something.

15:51.810 --> 15:53.560
Well, I want to join up.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.560
I think I got what it takes
to be a citizen.

15:55.640 --> 15:58.060
Good for you.
Go find out.

15:58.110 --> 16:00.020
Well, my parents
are against it.

16:00.110 --> 16:01.730
And I know it's my choice.

16:01.780 --> 16:03.610
I was wondering...

16:03.650 --> 16:04.950
what would you do
if you were me?

16:06.110 --> 16:07.471
Figuring things out
for yourself...

16:07.490 --> 16:09.740
is the only freedom
anyone really has.

16:09.830 --> 16:11.290
Use that freedom.

16:11.330 --> 16:13.580
Make up your own mind, Rico.

16:20.540 --> 16:23.130
But I have not been to paradise

16:25.300 --> 16:29.340
No, I have not been to paradise

16:30.350 --> 16:33.270
Watch the days go by

16:33.310 --> 16:35.230
All is fine

16:35.310 --> 16:36.940
Don't exaggerate.

16:36.980 --> 16:40.020
I'm serious. I think you have
really beautiful eyes.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.900
- You know?
- Johnny.

16:44.490 --> 16:46.740
Uh, this is Zander.

16:46.820 --> 16:49.620
Yeah, we know each other
from the game.

16:49.660 --> 16:54.580
- No hard feelings?
- No, none at all. We won.

16:54.660 --> 16:58.460
Come on, Carmen.
It's the last dance.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.500
Well, maybe I'll see you
at the Academy.

17:00.580 --> 17:01.960
Yeah. Who knows?

17:04.170 --> 17:08.680
- Good luck.
- Zander's going for pilot too.

17:10.180 --> 17:12.599
You two have so much in common.

17:12.680 --> 17:15.810
Johnny Rico, are you jealous?

17:15.849 --> 17:18.560
Well, maybe.

17:18.599 --> 17:20.770
You don't have to be jealous.

17:25.109 --> 17:26.740
Hey, hey, break it up, you two.

17:26.780 --> 17:29.280
There's a place
for that sort of thing.

17:32.280 --> 17:36.080
I've been thinking,
and I'm gonna do it, Carmen.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.040
I'm gonna go
for Federal Service.

17:38.080 --> 17:40.420
That's great.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.420
Carl and I are signing up
tomorrow. Come with us.

17:43.460 --> 17:44.840
I will.

17:50.630 --> 17:53.850
My father's not home tonight.

17:54.810 --> 17:56.640
All is well

17:59.730 --> 18:03.520
All is well

18:04.650 --> 18:06.980
Talk about it

18:07.070 --> 18:09.570
Watch the days go by

18:09.650 --> 18:11.910
All is well

18:11.990 --> 18:14.160
24th century dies

18:14.240 --> 18:17.870
I do now,
of my own free will...

18:17.910 --> 18:21.370
after having been
duly advised and warned...

18:21.420 --> 18:24.710
of the meaning and consequences
of this oath...

18:24.750 --> 18:27.000
enrol in the Federal Service...

18:27.090 --> 18:29.340
for not less than two years...

18:29.420 --> 18:32.550
and as much longer
as may be required...

18:32.590 --> 18:34.760
by the needs of the Federation.

18:35.890 --> 18:37.970
- All set?
- Thank you.

18:42.140 --> 18:44.940
Fresh meat for the grinder, eh?

18:46.360 --> 18:50.240
- So, how'd you kids do?
- I'm gonna be a pilot.

18:50.280 --> 18:54.360
Well, good for you. We need
all the pilots we can get.

18:56.030 --> 18:58.950
- Hey, did you get starside R and D?
- No.

18:58.990 --> 19:02.540
- I don't believe it.
- I got Games and Theory.

19:02.580 --> 19:04.670
Games and Theory?

19:04.710 --> 19:07.290
- That's military intelligence.
- Yeah.

19:07.340 --> 19:09.670
Way to go, Carl.

19:09.710 --> 19:12.470
Next time we meet,
I'll probably have to salute you.

19:12.510 --> 19:14.010
Hmm.

19:15.340 --> 19:17.260
How about you, son?

19:17.350 --> 19:20.310
- Infantry, sir.
- Good for you.

19:20.350 --> 19:22.940
Mobile Infantry made me
the man I am today.

19:24.600 --> 19:28.320
All recruits must report to the
Federal Transportation Hub...

19:28.360 --> 19:30.030
within 24 hours.

19:30.070 --> 19:32.740
Welcome to the adventure
of Federal Service.

19:32.780 --> 19:35.110
Let's make a vow.

19:35.160 --> 19:38.620
No matter what,
we'll always be friends.

19:40.330 --> 19:41.540
I'll go for that.

19:43.210 --> 19:45.540
Well, chances are we'll
never see each other again.

19:47.290 --> 19:50.420
We'll be millions of light-years
away from each other.

19:50.460 --> 19:52.970
But, uh, yeah, sure.
Why not?

19:55.510 --> 19:57.430
You'll resign, and that's
all there is to it.

19:57.510 --> 20:00.430
It may look bad, but if that's
the worst you suffer, then that's fine.

20:00.470 --> 20:03.430
- I won't quit!
- I'm telling you, you will.

20:03.480 --> 20:05.560
You're not going back.
You're going on vacation!

20:05.640 --> 20:07.560
I am not going on vacation!

20:07.650 --> 20:09.480
I want to be a citizen.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.020
It's my decision.
I made it.

20:11.070 --> 20:12.990
You walk out that door,
you are cut off, young man.

20:13.070 --> 20:14.700
You understand me?

20:14.740 --> 20:17.160
All right, that's it!
You are cut off!

20:17.240 --> 20:19.160
Johnny, why won't you
change your mind?

20:19.240 --> 20:21.410
Does citizenship
mean that much to you?

20:22.240 --> 20:24.410
Well, yeah, sure.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.370
Well, I hope so.

20:26.460 --> 20:29.040
I hope you don't ruin your life
over some silly little girl...

20:29.080 --> 20:31.090
who wants to look handsome
in a uniform.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.460
- Don't talk about Carmen that way!
- Johnny.

20:33.550 --> 20:35.470
Your attention, please.

20:35.510 --> 20:39.850
Outbound group 1380,
all hub 29 connections.

20:39.930 --> 20:41.600
- Do you have everything?
- Moscow now boarding...

20:41.680 --> 20:43.600
- Great.
...at bank 8-A.

20:49.100 --> 20:52.480
- Johnny.
- Be a good girl, hear?

20:52.570 --> 20:55.320
- You're late.
- My dad had to help me pack.

20:55.360 --> 20:58.160
Suddenly he's afraid he's never
gonna see me again or something.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.700
It was sweet,
but it took forever.

21:00.780 --> 21:05.540
Oh. Anyway, I guess
I'm ready to go.

21:05.620 --> 21:08.670
Yeah, me too. I'm wearing
everything I own.

21:11.460 --> 21:13.380
I'm sorry your parents
were mad.

21:13.460 --> 21:15.880
Who cares? The Federation
will give me...

21:15.920 --> 21:18.260
everything I need for
the next two years, right?

21:19.840 --> 21:23.560
- You talk to Carl?
- Yeah, he left this morning.

21:23.640 --> 21:27.520
- Couldn't say where.
- Oh, it's exciting, going away.

21:27.560 --> 21:30.400
But I'm scared.
Aren't you?

21:35.320 --> 21:37.240
I'm gonna miss you.

21:38.650 --> 21:40.910
I'm gonna miss you too.

21:41.820 --> 21:43.910
I love you.

21:43.990 --> 21:47.120
Outbound group 94B
to Tereshkova...

21:47.160 --> 21:48.910
That's me.

21:51.290 --> 21:55.250
Just say it once.
Try it on for size.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.340
I love you.

22:08.890 --> 22:11.060
Don't forget to write.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.520
I won't.

22:27.790 --> 22:30.370
Fully automatic Morita.
Who wants to hold it?

22:30.460 --> 22:31.750
Me! Me! Me! Me! Me!

22:31.790 --> 22:36.130
Citizen rule. People
making a better tomorrow.

22:44.390 --> 22:47.430
A murderer was captured
this morning and tried today.

22:47.510 --> 22:49.430
Guilty.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.440
Sentence... death.

22:52.520 --> 22:55.730
Execution tonight at 6...00.
All net. All channels.

23:03.860 --> 23:06.830
If you think you're psychic,

23:06.870 --> 23:08.080
maybe you are.

23:10.370 --> 23:13.420
Federal studies are being
conducted in your community.

23:16.790 --> 23:20.840
Every school kid knows
that Arachnids are dangerous.

23:26.390 --> 23:29.430
However, Mormon extremists
disregarded Federal warnings...

23:29.470 --> 23:33.770
and established Fort Joe Smith deep
inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.

23:33.810 --> 23:38.020
Too late, they realized that Dantana had
already been chosen by other colonists...

23:38.070 --> 23:39.980
Arachnids.

23:45.410 --> 23:47.990
- One, two, three, four!
- Ten-hut!

23:48.080 --> 23:51.120
- One, two, three, four!
- Most of you will not...

23:51.160 --> 23:53.910
live to be
in the Mobile Infantry.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.670
The trouble is, you are not
good enough the way you are.

23:56.710 --> 23:58.880
Hands at your side!

23:58.920 --> 24:00.340
Chin up.

24:00.380 --> 24:03.220
I am your senior drill instructor,
Career Sergeant Zim!

24:03.260 --> 24:06.140
Suck in that gut!
Feet together!

24:08.930 --> 24:11.270
To think this had
to happen to me.

24:11.350 --> 24:13.770
What a bunch of apes.
No, strike that!

24:13.850 --> 24:15.140
You don't rate that good.

24:15.230 --> 24:17.310
Never in my life have I seen...

24:20.020 --> 24:22.280
Do you think I'm funny?
Do I make you laugh?

24:22.320 --> 24:25.030
- Do you think I'm a comedian, son?
- I'm sorry.

24:25.070 --> 24:29.240
The first words and the last words out
of your stinking holes will be "Sir"!

24:29.280 --> 24:31.450
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

24:31.490 --> 24:34.000
You see that armoury?
Run around it.

24:34.040 --> 24:36.370
Run, I said!
Run, run, run!

24:36.460 --> 24:38.460
- Bronski, keep pace!
- Move! Move!

24:38.540 --> 24:41.040
Now, anytime you think
I'm being too tough...

24:41.130 --> 24:43.050
anytime you think
I'm being unfair...

24:43.090 --> 24:46.630
anytime you miss
your mommy, quit!

24:46.680 --> 24:49.090
You sign form 1240-A,
you grab your gear...

24:49.180 --> 24:51.760
you take a stroll
down Washout Lane!

24:51.810 --> 24:53.560
Do you get me?

24:53.640 --> 24:55.890
- Sir, yes, sir!
- Pathetic!

24:55.980 --> 25:00.270
I wonder if there's a handful of
guts in the whole bunch of you.

25:00.310 --> 25:05.400
Now, who here thinks they got
what it takes to knock me down?

25:05.440 --> 25:08.280
Sir! I guess
maybe I do, sir!

25:18.000 --> 25:21.380
Ow! God! God!

25:23.460 --> 25:25.710
- You all right, son?
- Sir, yes, sir!

25:25.760 --> 25:29.050
It's my arm.
I think it's broken, sir.

25:29.130 --> 25:32.050
- Medic!
- God.

25:32.100 --> 25:35.060
Pain is in your mind!

25:35.100 --> 25:37.020
- Who's next?
- Sir!

25:37.100 --> 25:39.980
Recruit Flores reporting
for duty, sir!

25:49.360 --> 25:52.990
You specifically requested transfer from
Fort Cronkite to this training unit?

25:53.030 --> 25:54.790
Sir, I heard
it was the best, sir!

25:54.830 --> 25:57.960
It is the best.

25:58.040 --> 26:01.000
But what makes you think
you're good enough?

26:07.880 --> 26:09.970
Now that's the kind of gal
who makes squad leader.

26:10.010 --> 26:12.260
That's my job
you're talking about.

26:14.010 --> 26:15.310
Come on.

26:15.390 --> 26:16.680
- Here we go!
- Here we go!

26:16.720 --> 26:18.020
- Roughnecks!
- Roughnecks!

26:18.060 --> 26:19.430
- On the go!
- On the go!

26:29.740 --> 26:32.870
One, two, three, four...

26:32.910 --> 26:36.200
one, two, MI!

26:39.410 --> 26:41.250
You know, I'd like
to kill that Sergeant Zim.

26:41.290 --> 26:43.790
- Whoa, improper attitude!
- Watch it.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.081
- They'll kick you out for talking like that.
- Bye-bye.

26:46.090 --> 26:48.170
There you go down Washout Lane.

26:48.260 --> 26:50.670
Yup, you either got what
it takes, or you don't.

26:50.760 --> 26:53.010
- Hey, there is a line.
- Wait your turn, Ace.

26:53.050 --> 26:56.760
Hey, at ease, little soldier.
It's all the same muck.

26:56.810 --> 26:58.430
Get in line like everyone else.

27:08.530 --> 27:11.450
You got some guts
for a rich kid.

27:11.490 --> 27:13.990
I guess you and me could be
buddies. What do you say?

27:14.070 --> 27:15.570
Oh-oh, that is
no way to act.

27:15.620 --> 27:18.830
- I'm honoured.
- Hey! Of course you are.

27:18.870 --> 27:21.040
Everybody should have
a friend like me.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.330
Come on, Ace. Back of the line
now! Back of the line!

27:23.420 --> 27:24.710
- Back, back, back, back!
- All right. Hurry up, hurry up.

27:24.790 --> 27:26.420
- What a jerk, man.
- Tough guy.

27:28.500 --> 27:30.510
Hey, Rico, want
to sit together?

27:30.550 --> 27:31.970
No thanks, Diz.

27:34.260 --> 27:36.180
What's your malfunction, Rico?

27:37.600 --> 27:39.600
You are.

27:39.640 --> 27:42.430
I joined up to get out on my own,
and you had to tag along.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.940
You think I joined the Mobile
Infantry because of you?

27:46.980 --> 27:48.900
You saying you didn't?

27:55.320 --> 27:56.620
Hi.

27:56.660 --> 27:59.240
Forget about it, Ace.
You don't stand a chance.

27:59.330 --> 28:02.250
What makes you even think you're
gonna make squad leader, Rico?

28:02.290 --> 28:03.960
- Something I got, you don't.
- Ha!

28:04.040 --> 28:06.880
- You rich kids are all the same.
- It isn't about that.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.090
- It's about who's the best.
- Hey!

28:20.390 --> 28:21.930
Third squad!

28:21.970 --> 28:24.480
If someone's hurt, put him on your back
and take him out of there!

28:24.520 --> 28:25.730
Let's go!

28:26.850 --> 28:28.610
Go, Simmons!
Go, go, you sissy!

28:28.690 --> 28:31.690
Sir, I don't understand.

28:31.730 --> 28:33.990
Who needs a knife
in a nuke fight, anyway?

28:34.070 --> 28:37.780
All you gotta do
is push a button, sir.

28:37.820 --> 28:42.240
Cease fire. Put your hand
on that wall, trooper.

28:45.660 --> 28:47.830
Put your hand on that wall!

28:57.590 --> 28:59.010
Damn it.

29:03.930 --> 29:08.190
The enemy cannot push a button
if you disable his hand.

29:11.940 --> 29:13.150
Medic!

29:14.230 --> 29:15.900
Hand me that towel, will you?

29:15.990 --> 29:18.490
Ah, well, we all have
one thing in common.

29:18.570 --> 29:21.530
We were all stupid enough
to sign up for Mobile Infantry.

29:21.580 --> 29:24.700
- Breckinridge, what's your excuse?
- Oh, my family's all farmers.

29:24.750 --> 29:26.660
I hate farming. I mean,
uh, Mobile Infantry...

29:26.750 --> 29:28.670
It's like pure picnic
by comparison.

29:28.750 --> 29:32.210
All right, so they grow 'em big and dumb
on the farm planet, huh?

29:32.250 --> 29:34.670
- And pretty!
- I like big!

29:34.710 --> 29:37.720
- Djana, what about you?
- Oh, I'm going in for politics...

29:37.760 --> 29:39.840
and, you know, you gotta be
a citizen for that.

29:39.930 --> 29:43.060
- So here I am.
- Ah, you want some responsibility.

29:43.100 --> 29:46.390
- Yeah.
- Shujimi, come on, let's keep it goin'.

29:46.430 --> 29:48.850
I got into Harvard,
but my father says forget it.

29:48.940 --> 29:50.230
It's gonna cost an arm
and a leg, you know?

29:50.270 --> 29:52.020
So, if I serve,

29:52.060 --> 29:54.730
Federation pays my way.

29:54.780 --> 29:56.240
I want to have babies.

29:56.280 --> 29:58.610
You know, it's a lot easier to
get a license if you've served.

29:58.650 --> 30:00.410
- So...
- I'm going career.

30:00.450 --> 30:03.200
- Officer's training. All the way.
- Ah!

30:03.240 --> 30:05.580
Future Sky Marshal.
All right, Rico, your turn.

30:08.120 --> 30:09.580
Who asked you to be so nosy?

30:09.620 --> 30:11.710
What? I'm the-the bad guy?
I'm gonna be a writer, you know?

30:11.790 --> 30:14.590
A writer's got
a right to be nosy.

30:14.630 --> 30:17.460
Hey, Flores, you know
Rico from Buenos Aires.

30:17.510 --> 30:21.760
- What's his story?
- Oh, uh,

30:21.800 --> 30:23.800
he's here because of a girl.

30:24.640 --> 30:28.180
Oh, Rico! Lover boy!

30:29.640 --> 30:32.600
- He's getting me excited.
- He's gonna blow.

30:36.110 --> 30:37.320
Is it you?

30:41.320 --> 30:46.080
This is where we live.
It's not much, but it's home.

30:46.160 --> 30:49.870
Right there, that's my bunk,
where I dream about you every night.

30:51.330 --> 30:52.960
Boot's pretty tough.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.670
Sometimes I think I won't make it.

30:55.710 --> 30:58.050
But then I think about what
you're doing, and I try harder.

30:59.920 --> 31:04.260
- Hey, guys! Do you mind?
- Try harder, baby, try harder!

31:08.720 --> 31:12.810
Who knows? They might even
make me squad leader.

31:12.850 --> 31:14.610
Uh-oh,
I better pack it in.

31:14.690 --> 31:18.320
Oh, I love you, baby,
I love you!

31:18.360 --> 31:22.070
- Write me!
- I love you so much

31:22.110 --> 31:24.870
- I'm gonna kill you guys!
- I love you so much

31:27.660 --> 31:28.950
- Bye! Write me.
- Bye!

31:30.790 --> 31:32.870
Orbit in five, Ibanez.

31:32.960 --> 31:34.790
First one there gets to fly.

31:50.470 --> 31:52.640
- Locking it down.
- Wait! Wait!

31:54.690 --> 31:57.520
Oh, no. Not Ibanez again.
She's crazy!

31:57.560 --> 31:59.650
Ready, go!

32:06.200 --> 32:07.570
Yeah!

32:09.370 --> 32:10.910
Deploying wings.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.370
How come you're
in such a good mood, huh?

32:57.460 --> 32:59.290
'Cause today I get to fly that.

33:22.730 --> 33:25.150
Pilot Trainee Ibanez
reporting for duty, ma'am.

33:25.240 --> 33:27.070
Take the number two chair,
Ibanez.

33:27.150 --> 33:29.410
- Yes, ma'am.
- You see that?

33:32.740 --> 33:38.000
- Identify.
- Ibanez, T-325-A, clear.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.130
What are you doing here?

33:46.170 --> 33:49.090
I'm the guy whose gonna
teach you to fly this crate.

33:49.130 --> 33:51.970
Oh, Assistant Instructor.

33:53.010 --> 33:55.520
Should I call you " sir"?

33:55.600 --> 33:58.600
- Only when I give you an order.
- Prepare for departure.

34:00.060 --> 34:03.690
It's amazing, us running
into each other like this.

34:03.730 --> 34:06.530
- Maybe it's fate.
- Maybe not.

34:06.570 --> 34:09.780
Heard about this crazy girl
coming through the Academy.

34:09.820 --> 34:14.489
Solid math, a little wild
on the stick, but a natural.

34:14.540 --> 34:16.040
And when it turned out
to be you,

34:16.080 --> 34:18.330
I just made sure that we
would run into each other.

34:18.370 --> 34:21.130
Rodger Young cleared for
undocking and departure.

34:21.170 --> 34:23.000
All right, Ibanez.

34:23.090 --> 34:25.420
- Take her out.
- Yes, ma'am.

34:26.710 --> 34:28.630
All systems go.

34:52.570 --> 34:56.199
In simulation, my supervisors
could never keep up.

34:56.239 --> 34:58.080
Well, this isn't simulation any more...

34:58.120 --> 35:00.790
so take her out easy, cadet.

35:00.830 --> 35:02.120
Yes, sir.

35:11.180 --> 35:12.760
Five metres from object.

35:15.890 --> 35:17.470
Three metres from object.

35:22.190 --> 35:23.560
Clear.

35:26.520 --> 35:29.530
- Don't exceed port speed.
- Or what?

35:29.570 --> 35:34.320
Or they revoke your flight
status, and mine.

35:36.030 --> 35:38.450
Your career is in my hands.

35:45.580 --> 35:47.000
Steady as she goes, Number Two.

35:47.040 --> 35:49.300
- Prepare for warp.
- Yes, ma'am.

35:49.380 --> 35:52.670
Number One, design
for Jupiter orbit.

35:52.720 --> 35:56.600
All crew, all sections,
stand by to cut in C-drive.

35:56.640 --> 36:00.430
- Star drive in five, four,
- Five, four...

36:00.470 --> 36:02.810
- ready... three, two...
- Steady...

36:02.850 --> 36:04.440
- one...
- Go!

36:28.420 --> 36:30.250
We're going in!
Move!

36:39.300 --> 36:40.760
Man, they're defended.
No way in.

36:43.180 --> 36:45.600
- Flip six, three hole.
- What?

36:45.640 --> 36:48.440
You run a flip six, three
hole play, and you can score.

36:48.480 --> 36:49.900
- Cover me.
- You got it.

36:58.320 --> 36:59.990
Now!

37:06.540 --> 37:09.040
- Thanks, buddy.
- Bastard!

37:18.180 --> 37:19.600
Yeah!

37:25.180 --> 37:27.270
Kid's got some moves.

37:27.310 --> 37:29.230
Give him a squad.
See what he can do.

37:34.190 --> 37:36.030
Kitty, Kitty.

37:36.070 --> 37:38.570
Someone's got to teach you guys
how to play some pool here.

37:39.820 --> 37:41.280
Look at him.

37:41.330 --> 37:44.120
Have you ever seen anybody
so pleased with himself?

37:44.160 --> 37:47.870
Well, Zim must have had to choose
someone to be his brownnose.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.290
All right, where were we?

37:50.330 --> 37:52.250
Okay, watch and learn.
Watch and learn.

37:53.960 --> 37:55.800
I couldn't have done it
without you, Diz.

37:57.670 --> 37:59.050
Friends?

38:01.800 --> 38:03.310
Friends.

38:04.520 --> 38:07.100
- Mail call! Levy!
- Yeah, that's me.

38:07.180 --> 38:09.770
- Shujimi!
- Here.

38:09.850 --> 38:11.310
- Rico.
- Here.

38:11.360 --> 38:13.440
- Breckinridge!
- Yeah, right here.

38:13.480 --> 38:16.610
- Niler.
- Yeah, here I am. Ah, great, my dad.

38:16.690 --> 38:18.700
That's all, folks.

38:26.160 --> 38:27.660
Hi, Johnny.

38:27.700 --> 38:30.290
I'm sorry I haven't
written you sooner, but, uh...

38:30.370 --> 38:32.960
- Oh, Rico, - it's been really busy.
- You don't deserve that!

38:33.040 --> 38:35.050
- Shh, shh.
- They've really got us going here.

38:35.090 --> 38:37.670
They must have made you
squad leader by now.

38:37.710 --> 38:40.130
And if they haven't,
tell 'em to talk to me.

38:40.220 --> 38:42.470
See? All it takes is
the love of a good woman.

38:42.550 --> 38:44.970
- Yeah. - That is a woman.
- Beautiful.

38:45.060 --> 38:47.850
- Look at that.
- Look at those. - Stop it.

38:47.890 --> 38:49.810
- Isn't it beautiful?
- I'm dying.

38:49.890 --> 38:52.060
I love it out here.

38:54.230 --> 38:56.900
- That's also the problem.
- Shh, shh, shh, shh.

38:56.940 --> 39:01.200
Because I think
I'm gonna go career.

39:02.490 --> 39:04.910
I want to command
a ship of my own.

39:04.950 --> 39:06.870
And you know...

39:08.580 --> 39:10.040
I don't think that's gonna
leave a lot of room...

39:10.080 --> 39:12.170
for you and me, Johnny.

39:13.420 --> 39:15.590
- Oh, God.
- Jeez.

39:15.630 --> 39:19.170
I know that's not
what you wanted to hear.

39:19.260 --> 39:20.550
But, uh...

39:22.760 --> 39:27.100
I have to follow my heart.
I'm sorry.

39:29.140 --> 39:32.190
Write me, all right?

39:32.270 --> 39:34.860
Write me so that I know
we'll always be friends.

39:50.040 --> 39:53.250
- Let's get back to the game.
- I feel so sorry for Johnny.

39:53.290 --> 39:54.670
Funny how they always
want to be friends...

39:54.710 --> 39:57.590
after they rip your guts
out, huh?

39:57.630 --> 40:00.460
Yeah. Well,
it's what I deserve.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.840
What are you talking about?

40:05.680 --> 40:07.600
Oh, I joined up for her.

40:08.930 --> 40:11.180
I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for her.

40:11.270 --> 40:14.100
What are you talking about? You
made squad leader on your own.

40:16.860 --> 40:19.440
And, hey, you still got me
to kick around.

40:24.150 --> 40:25.610
Fun and games are over,
children.

40:25.660 --> 40:27.740
You will be firing
live ammunition...

40:27.780 --> 40:30.040
in a simulated combat
environment.

40:30.120 --> 40:34.540
You will exercise extreme
caution on my assault course!

40:34.580 --> 40:37.380
- Do you get me?
- Sir, yes, sir!

40:37.420 --> 40:39.250
Rico, take 'em out!

40:40.710 --> 40:43.920
First fire team with me.
Next team in ten seconds.

40:43.970 --> 40:46.840
Maximum score has been 280.

40:46.890 --> 40:50.850
- I expect you to do better!
- Go!

40:59.020 --> 41:00.770
Shujimi, stay down!

41:09.830 --> 41:13.200
Hey! Goddam it, Breckinridge,
clear my line of fire!

41:13.290 --> 41:15.290
It's my helmet!
It's all screwed up!

41:15.330 --> 41:17.080
You're gonna blow the score!

41:17.170 --> 41:18.750
- Damn!
- Dumb shit!

41:18.790 --> 41:20.250
Diz, stay put!
What's the problem?

41:20.290 --> 41:22.130
- Damn thing keeps getting in my way!
- Give it to me.

41:22.170 --> 41:24.510
How come whenever something goes wrong,
it's always you, Breckinridge?

41:24.550 --> 41:26.010
It must be 'cause
I'm big and dumb!

41:26.050 --> 41:27.720
Yeah, right!

41:33.720 --> 41:35.640
Medic!

41:38.400 --> 41:42.020
Rico, you are relieved
of squad command!

41:44.070 --> 41:47.110
Rico, did you give the recruit
permission to remove his helmet?

41:47.150 --> 41:50.070
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge
reported a helmet malfunction...

41:50.120 --> 41:51.780
and I asked him
to show it to me, sir.

41:51.830 --> 41:55.620
Are you rated to repair
the M-3 Tactical Helmet, Rico?

41:57.290 --> 41:58.790
Sir, no, sir!

41:58.830 --> 42:00.750
Then why did you order your man
to remove his helmet...

42:00.830 --> 42:03.420
during a live fire exercise?

42:03.500 --> 42:06.720
Sir, I needed everyone in
my squad operational, sir!

42:08.180 --> 42:10.680
I wanted to win, sir!

42:16.560 --> 42:17.980
Carry on.

42:25.360 --> 42:30.030
Sergeant, we've already lost
two recruits over this incident.

42:30.070 --> 42:33.200
Do you think there's any possibility
of salvaging this man?

42:34.990 --> 42:36.370
Yes, sir, I do.

42:37.660 --> 42:39.040
All right.

42:40.540 --> 42:42.380
We'll try administrative punishment.

42:48.220 --> 42:50.130
Prisoner, halt!

43:07.940 --> 43:09.860
Bite down on this, son.

43:09.950 --> 43:12.530
It helps.
I know.

43:22.830 --> 43:25.880
For incompetence of command...

43:25.960 --> 43:28.630
for failure to abide
by safety regulations...

43:28.670 --> 43:32.130
during a live fire exercise...

43:32.180 --> 43:35.890
for negligence which contributed
to the death of a teammate...

43:35.930 --> 43:38.180
recruit trainee John Rico...

43:38.270 --> 43:40.350
is sentenced to
administrative punishment.

43:42.020 --> 43:43.230
Ten lashes.

43:45.190 --> 43:47.110
You may carry out the sentence.

43:54.410 --> 43:56.490
One!

43:57.990 --> 44:00.080
Two!

44:01.830 --> 44:03.250
Three!

44:05.210 --> 44:07.130
Four!

44:09.130 --> 44:10.800
Five!

44:13.300 --> 44:14.430
Six!

44:16.300 --> 44:17.510
Seven!

44:19.310 --> 44:21.890
Eight!

44:21.980 --> 44:23.350
Nine!

44:24.980 --> 44:26.400
Ten!

44:38.700 --> 44:41.750
All sections secure.
EBS is high normal.

44:41.830 --> 44:44.790
Switching to slave on my mark.
Mark.

44:48.670 --> 44:50.590
Thanks.
You read my mind.

44:52.380 --> 44:55.510
Oh, third watch always
seems to last forever.

44:55.590 --> 44:57.260
I don't know.

44:57.340 --> 44:59.850
It depends on who
you're spending it with.

45:02.600 --> 45:04.430
Something's wrong.

45:08.900 --> 45:12.940
- There.
- No, I replotted the course.

45:12.990 --> 45:16.200
- It's more efficient this way.
- Three weeks aboard a starship...

45:16.240 --> 45:18.490
and you think that you
can lick my navs?

45:18.570 --> 45:19.870
Check it.

45:25.000 --> 45:28.130
You know, I was talking
with Captain Deladier...

45:28.170 --> 45:29.670
and, uh, she said...

45:29.710 --> 45:32.300
Don't change the subject.

45:32.380 --> 45:33.670
Am I right?

45:41.050 --> 45:44.100
Yeah. Yeah.
You're right.

45:44.140 --> 45:46.480
So, what did the captain say?

45:47.900 --> 45:50.690
She thinks that we ought
to team up officially...

45:52.690 --> 45:55.530
and crew for her.

45:55.570 --> 45:59.110
- You and me, huh?
- We're good together, Carmen.

45:59.160 --> 46:02.530
We're way ahead of the curve
in every department.

46:02.580 --> 46:05.620
I can anticipate you.

46:05.660 --> 46:08.460
You know what I want.

46:10.080 --> 46:13.380
No. What do you want?

46:21.180 --> 46:23.010
There's a gravity field
out there.

46:25.310 --> 46:27.640
- Run a scan. Sensors on.
- There.

46:30.270 --> 46:33.570
- Gravity at 225 and rising.
- Report.

46:33.610 --> 46:35.610
Captain, we're in the path
of an unidentified object...

46:35.650 --> 46:37.400
moving toward us at high speed.

46:37.440 --> 46:39.780
Profile suggests
an asteroid, ma'am.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.750
- Impact, six seconds!
- Emergency evasion!

46:59.720 --> 47:02.220
Three, two,

47:05.310 --> 47:06.600
fire!

47:21.490 --> 47:23.240
Close compartment 21!

47:37.380 --> 47:38.840
Where'd it come from?

47:38.880 --> 47:41.760
It came out of the Arachnid
Quarantine Zone, ma'am.

47:43.680 --> 47:46.640
Number Four, contact Fleet. Tell 'em
there's a loose asteroid headed their way.

47:46.680 --> 47:48.850
Communications are down,
ma'am. They're gone.

47:50.520 --> 47:53.480
- Damage assessment.
- Hull's compromised.

47:53.520 --> 47:55.060
We're lucky to be alive, ma'am.

47:55.110 --> 47:57.020
Luck didn't have anything
to do with it.

47:58.320 --> 48:00.150
We have a hell
of a flight team.

48:15.540 --> 48:17.960
It really stinks, you going.

48:18.000 --> 48:20.880
Yeah, well, the Mobile Infantry
will just have to get along without me.

48:25.050 --> 48:27.930
I don't get it, Rico.
You took your licks.

48:27.970 --> 48:29.640
If they didn't want you,
they would have kicked you out.

48:29.720 --> 48:31.140
Hey...

48:32.600 --> 48:34.720
I joined up for the wrong reasons.
I got a guy killed.

48:34.730 --> 48:37.060
I figure that kind of proves
I don't have what it takes.

48:37.150 --> 48:40.690
Rico, your call's going through.

48:40.780 --> 48:42.690
Take it there.

48:48.740 --> 48:53.080
- Hello? Oh, Johnny!
- Hi, Mom.

48:53.120 --> 48:55.210
B-Bill, pick it up.
It's Johnny!

48:55.250 --> 48:57.080
- Johnny?
- Dad.

48:57.130 --> 48:58.540
- Where's your uniform?
- Bill.

49:00.340 --> 49:02.260
It's just good
to hear from you.

49:02.340 --> 49:04.680
How are you, son?

49:04.720 --> 49:06.970
It's not really working out
here for me, Dad.

49:07.050 --> 49:08.600
I was thinking...

49:08.640 --> 49:10.600
I was hoping it would be
all right if I came home.

49:10.640 --> 49:13.680
Well, of-of course. You should
come home immediately.

49:15.100 --> 49:17.350
I'm sorry.
I've been an idiot.

49:17.440 --> 49:19.770
Don't talk like that.
You just come on home...

49:19.820 --> 49:21.020
talk things out.

49:22.610 --> 49:23.990
We love you, son.

49:25.450 --> 49:28.030
- My, what's that?
- Looks like rain.

49:28.120 --> 49:30.830
- This time of year?
- Sure is dark.

49:30.870 --> 49:32.620
Your transmission
has been terminated...

49:32.660 --> 49:35.250
due to atmospheric
interference.

49:35.290 --> 49:36.790
Please try your call
again later.

49:39.960 --> 49:41.340
Sanchez!

49:43.460 --> 49:45.090
Well, see ya.

49:45.130 --> 49:48.590
Hey, you take that stroll
down Washout Lane...

49:48.640 --> 49:50.470
you're only proving
one thing, Johnny.

49:50.550 --> 49:51.930
What's that, Diz?

49:55.480 --> 49:58.350
That you don't have what
it takes to be a citizen.

50:02.480 --> 50:04.740
Mobile Infantry is passing by

50:04.820 --> 50:06.740
Mobile Infantry is passing by

50:06.820 --> 50:09.070
- Well, sound off
- Ml

50:09.160 --> 50:11.410
- Sound off
- Passing by

50:11.490 --> 50:14.450
- Count now
- One, two, three, four

50:14.500 --> 50:16.910
- That's it! That's it!
- Left. Left.

50:17.000 --> 50:19.790
- Left, right, left.
- Do you get me?

50:19.830 --> 50:23.130
- Sir, yes, sir! - I can't hear you!
- What's going on, you guys?

50:23.170 --> 50:24.550
Move, move, move!

50:27.170 --> 50:28.720
What's happening?

50:34.350 --> 50:35.810
Hey, hey, what's going on?

50:35.850 --> 50:37.600
Wh-What's going on?

50:37.680 --> 50:41.310
- Hey, Kitten, what's going on?
- It's war! We're going to war!

50:45.690 --> 50:49.320
The devastation we are seeing
is unparalleled.

50:49.400 --> 50:54.330
Judging from early estimates,
millions dead, a city in ruins.

50:54.370 --> 50:56.450
Is that Geneva?

50:56.540 --> 50:58.370
Goddam bugs whacked us, Johnny.

50:58.460 --> 51:01.830
The meteor was shot out
of orbit by bug plasma...

51:01.880 --> 51:05.340
that derived from Klendathu,
the Arachnids' home planet.

51:13.050 --> 51:17.560
Nothing lives in what was once
called the Latin Paradise.

51:17.640 --> 51:19.020
Oh, Johnny, it's us.

51:19.060 --> 51:22.600
Buenos Aires has been
wiped off the Earth.

51:27.320 --> 51:28.940
That's home.

51:31.410 --> 51:34.450
The Federal Council met moments
ago and voted unanimously...

51:34.490 --> 51:38.370
for mobilization to destroy
the Arachnid threat.

51:45.130 --> 51:47.300
- I'm serious. I'll go anywhere.
- Forget it, Zim. We need you here.

51:47.340 --> 51:50.300
- I want combat, sir.
- The only way you're gonna see combat...

51:50.340 --> 51:52.260
is if you bust yourself
to private!

51:52.340 --> 51:55.390
- Get me?
- Yes, sir, I get you.

51:55.430 --> 51:58.560
- Sir!
- What do you want, Rico?

51:58.640 --> 52:01.690
I wish to reconsider
my request to drop out, sir.

52:01.770 --> 52:03.850
You already signed
your 1240-A, son.

52:03.940 --> 52:07.650
- It wouldn't be legal.
- Major, I know it was wrong.

52:07.690 --> 52:10.490
I didn't learn from one mistake,
and I made another, sir.

52:10.530 --> 52:12.450
You made your decision, son.

52:12.530 --> 52:17.200
Sir, my family, my whole family,
was in Buenos Aires, sir.

52:20.120 --> 52:23.250
Is this your signature, Rico?

52:23.290 --> 52:24.960
Sir, yes, it is, sir!

52:29.670 --> 52:32.420
Doesn't look like it to me.

52:35.140 --> 52:39.100
- Carry on, Private!
- Yes, sir!

52:51.150 --> 52:56.200
Out of the ashes of Buenos Aires
comes first sorrow...

52:56.280 --> 52:57.910
then anger.

52:57.990 --> 53:00.950
The only good bug
is a dead bug.

53:01.040 --> 53:04.120
In Geneva,
the Federal Council convenes.

53:04.210 --> 53:07.920
We must meet the threat
with our valour, our blood...

53:08.000 --> 53:10.210
indeed, with our very lives...

53:10.300 --> 53:14.880
to ensure that human civilization,
not insect...

53:14.970 --> 53:18.850
dominates this galaxy,
now and always!

53:20.140 --> 53:21.720
Sky Marshal Dienes
announces plans...

53:21.810 --> 53:23.770
for an offensive
against Klendathu...

53:23.850 --> 53:27.230
source of the bug meteor
that destroyed Buenos Aires.

53:29.860 --> 53:34.280
Every day, Federal scientists
are looking for new ways to kill bugs.

53:34.360 --> 53:36.740
Your basic Arachnid warrior
isn't too smart...

53:36.820 --> 53:38.160
but you can blow off a limb...

53:40.990 --> 53:43.580
and it's still 86 percent
combat effective.

53:43.660 --> 53:47.420
Here's a tip... Aim for the nerve stem,
and put it down for good.

53:54.170 --> 53:57.300
Everyone's doing their part. Are you?

53:59.390 --> 54:01.930
- Die! Die!
- The war effort needs your effort...

54:02.010 --> 54:04.310
at work, at home,
in your community.

54:08.230 --> 54:09.940
We now break net and take you live...

54:10.020 --> 54:12.320
to Fleet Battle Station Ticonderoga...

54:12.400 --> 54:14.940
deep inside
the Arachnid Quarantine Zone...

54:15.030 --> 54:19.620
where the men and women of the Federal
Armed Services prepare to attack.

54:19.700 --> 54:23.620
DXQ uplink on two, one.
You're on.

54:23.700 --> 54:25.950
No one here in the AQZ
knows exactly...

54:26.040 --> 54:28.290
when the invasion
of Klendathu will occur.

54:28.370 --> 54:30.130
But everyone's
talking about it...

54:30.210 --> 54:32.130
and the talk says tomorrow.

54:32.210 --> 54:35.130
Here's a bunch of Ml kids that look
like they could eat bugs for lunch.

54:35.210 --> 54:37.130
- Yum, yum, yum.
- So, trooper,

54:37.220 --> 54:38.970
you're not too worried
about fighting the Arachnids?

54:39.050 --> 54:41.720
Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole,
you got a lot of dead bugs.

54:41.800 --> 54:44.890
- Am I right?
- I just hope it's not over before we get some.

54:44.970 --> 54:46.810
- Okay, come on.
- Some say the bugs were provoked...

54:46.890 --> 54:49.560
by the intrusion of humans
into their natural habitat...

54:49.650 --> 54:53.650
that a "live and let live policy"
is preferable to war with the bugs.

54:53.730 --> 54:55.150
Let me tell you something.

54:55.230 --> 54:57.320
I'm from Buenos Aires,
and I say kill them all!

54:57.400 --> 54:58.740
- Yeah!
- Go on, trooper! - Yeah!

54:58.820 --> 55:00.240
- Yeah!
- Oh, yeah!

55:00.320 --> 55:02.240
Big bad bugs, huh?

55:02.320 --> 55:04.410
Hey, guys,
we ought to get tattoos.

55:04.490 --> 55:05.830
- Hey, let's all get cut together.
- Yeah.

55:05.910 --> 55:07.250
- What do I want a tattoo for?
- Oh, what?

55:07.330 --> 55:08.910
Your skin's too pretty?
Come on, everybody's doing it.

55:09.000 --> 55:10.330
Hey, Johnny!

55:12.670 --> 55:14.000
Johnny Rico.

55:16.340 --> 55:17.670
Carmen?

55:20.630 --> 55:22.930
Oh. At ease.

55:23.010 --> 55:26.060
Guess I ought to lose the hat
when I'm off duty.

55:26.140 --> 55:30.390
- Hi, Diz.
- Carmen.

55:32.650 --> 55:35.270
My mother was right about you.

55:35.360 --> 55:37.190
You look great in a uniform.

55:37.280 --> 55:39.190
You look pretty good yourself.

55:41.070 --> 55:42.990
So, what do you hear?

55:43.070 --> 55:46.030
You know about anyone
who made it out of BA alive?

55:46.120 --> 55:48.700
Most of the time
I don't think about it.

55:48.790 --> 55:50.410
Like it happened
to someone else.

55:50.500 --> 55:54.710
Then it hits me,
and I, uh, can't stop crying.

55:54.790 --> 55:58.550
Well, we're still alive.
Got to be happy about that.

55:58.630 --> 56:01.930
You don't look
very happy to see me.

56:02.010 --> 56:04.390
Should I be?

56:04.470 --> 56:09.220
Johnny, it's different now.
We're at war.

56:09.310 --> 56:13.400
I mean, I think what I did was
probably the best thing for both of us.

56:13.480 --> 56:15.650
Everything copacetic,
Lieutenant?

56:16.650 --> 56:19.070
Zander, you remember Johnny.

56:19.150 --> 56:21.400
Zander and I
are a flight team now.

56:21.490 --> 56:23.240
Yeah, and we're best in the fleet.

56:24.660 --> 56:26.330
I get it.

56:26.410 --> 56:29.240
This is the part that's
best for both of us.

56:29.330 --> 56:31.910
- Don't do me any more favours.
- Johnny, wait.

56:32.000 --> 56:34.250
No, forget it, Lieutenant.
He's Mobile Infantry.

56:34.330 --> 56:36.250
See, when you're
trained to kill...

56:36.340 --> 56:38.750
it just doesn't pay
to be polite.

56:38.840 --> 56:41.090
You got something to say
about the Mobile Infantry?

56:41.170 --> 56:44.050
I think you heard me.

56:44.130 --> 56:47.180
You want to make
something of it, Private?

56:48.970 --> 56:51.230
Not with an officer.
No, sir.

56:51.310 --> 56:55.060
- The MI doesn't mint stupid troopers.
- Well, let's disregard rank.

56:55.150 --> 56:57.400
- Zander, please.
- Let it go, Rico. - Let it go.

56:57.480 --> 57:00.940
Everybody hear that?
Rank is not an issue here.

57:01.030 --> 57:04.030
- Don't do this.
- Come on. What's he gonna do?

57:17.960 --> 57:20.500
Come on, jarheads!

57:20.590 --> 57:22.420
Let go of me! Come on!
I'm gonna kill you!

57:24.090 --> 57:28.050
I'm gonna kill you!
I'll kill you!

57:28.140 --> 57:29.780
- Guys! Guys! Quit it!
- Come on! Come on!

57:29.810 --> 57:31.220
- He's not worth it!
- Come on! - Come on!

57:31.310 --> 57:33.020
- Let's get...
- Come on!

57:33.100 --> 57:36.850
Forget it, Rico! Mobile Infantry
and Fleet don't mix. Come on.

57:39.110 --> 57:40.770
Come on, let's go.

57:42.900 --> 57:44.280
Jarheads.

57:46.740 --> 57:49.490
- Mobile Infantry rules!
- Yeah!

57:49.580 --> 57:51.620
Oh, God, that hurts.

57:51.700 --> 57:54.790
Hey, well, I got something that might
hurt just a little bit more, buddy.

57:56.420 --> 57:59.840
Oh, yeah! We're gonna fight,
and we're gonna win!

57:59.920 --> 58:02.130
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

58:17.600 --> 58:19.350
This is the captain speaking.

58:19.440 --> 58:21.650
All personnel prepare for drop.

58:21.730 --> 58:24.150
We are at D-minus three
and counting.

58:35.620 --> 58:38.710
We are going in
with first wave.

58:38.790 --> 58:40.920
Means more bugs for us to kill.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.500
You smash the entire area.

58:42.590 --> 58:44.670
You kill anything that has
more than two legs.

58:44.760 --> 58:47.260
- You get me?
- We get you, sir!

59:35.310 --> 59:38.140
- Plasma, ma'am, from the planet.
- Bug batteries.

59:38.230 --> 59:41.060
According to military intelligence,
it'll be random and light.

59:42.730 --> 59:45.320
- Drop status?
- Drop is...

59:45.400 --> 59:47.480
35 percent complete, ma'am.

59:52.990 --> 59:54.410
Steady as she goes, Number Two.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:11.590
Remember your training,
and you will make it back alive!

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.360
This isn't random or light.
Someone made a mistake.

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:34.280
That's it.
We're empty, ma'am.

01:00:44.330 --> 01:00:46.130
Someone made
a big goddam mistake!

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.050
Break for high orbit!

01:01:34.010 --> 01:01:35.340
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:42.140
Johnny!

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:06.330
- Rockets up!
- Rocket crew, move up!

01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:33.230
- Nuke 'em! Levy! Rico!
- Heat 'em up!

01:02:37.990 --> 01:02:40.820
- Set.
- Fire!

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.740
Down!

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.830
- Follow me!
- Let's go!

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.920
First platoon, left flank!

01:02:56.010 --> 01:03:00.140
Split up! First and
second squads, follow me.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:03.010
Two, cover!
One, with me!

01:03:03.930 --> 01:03:05.850
Along side! Side to side!

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.730
Fire!

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.960
Here they come!

01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:34.800
- Ace, what are we doing?
- Uh, I don't know.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.260
- I don't know.
- Kill them! Kill them all!

01:03:50.730 --> 01:03:52.560
Come on!

01:03:54.690 --> 01:03:57.610
Come on! Come on!
You want some?

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:00.610
Here's some! Yeah!

01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:02.070
Here's some of this!

01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:07.620
Oh, my God!

01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:10.120
Shujimi!

01:04:10.210 --> 01:04:12.250
No, no, no!

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:16.250
Help! Help! Help!

01:04:18.670 --> 01:04:20.970
No! God!

01:04:26.350 --> 01:04:28.470
Let's get out of here!

01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:32.940
Fall back!

01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:59.800
Mayday!

01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:02.041
- All units, - What's going on?
- Fall back to retrieval.

01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:03.530
- Repeat.
- You got com? -All units...

01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:05.300
- fall back to retrieval.
- It's a general retreat!

01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:07.470
- Back to the boats!
- Come on!

01:05:07.550 --> 01:05:08.890
Come on, let's go!

01:05:10.890 --> 01:05:12.480
We've just landed here
on what cap troopers...

01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.650
are calling Big K...

01:05:14.730 --> 01:05:17.230
with the 6th Mobile
Infantry Division.

01:05:17.310 --> 01:05:20.320
It's an ugly planet,
a bug planet.

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.490
A planet hostile
to life as we...

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:29.490
Help me!

01:05:33.660 --> 01:05:35.000
Squad right!

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:49.760
Come on! Go, go, go!

01:05:49.850 --> 01:05:51.520
Get out of here now!

01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:55.301
- Watch your step!
- Watch your flank! Watch your flank!

01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:57.190
GXR, we're being overrun.

01:06:07.110 --> 01:06:09.370
Kitten, no!

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.900
Oh, God!

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:46.070
Oh, God! Oh! Oh!

01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:17.020
Crisis for humankind.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:19.440
Fleet officials admit
they underestimated...

01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.940
the Arachnids'
defensive capability.

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.610
Accepting responsibility
for Klendathu...

01:07:25.690 --> 01:07:28.280
Sky Marshal Dienes resigns.

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.950
His successor,
Sky Marshal Tahat Meru...

01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:33.620
outlines her new strategy.

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.620
To fight the bug...

01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:38.120
we must understand the bug.

01:07:38.210 --> 01:07:41.330
We can ill afford
another Klendathu.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.920
Federal scientists
struggle to explain...

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.840
the intelligent military actions
of the Arachnids.

01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:51.010
When a colony reaches
a certain size...

01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:53.800
300 generations or something,
it gets smarter.

01:07:53.890 --> 01:07:55.260
- Insects with intelligence?
- Now, wait...

01:07:55.350 --> 01:07:57.100
Have you ever met one?
I can't believe...

01:07:57.180 --> 01:07:59.100
- I am hearing this nonsense.
- Would you just wait a moment?

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:02.220
- This is the most ridiculous conversation I have ever had.
- Maybe... Maybe...

01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:05.940
there is some kind of bug
that we haven't seen yet...

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.440
a leadership caste,
a-a hive brain.

01:08:08.530 --> 01:08:13.200
Brain Bugs? Frankly, I find the idea
of a bug that thinks offensive!

01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:30.880
Ticonderoga, this is Rodger Young
requesting approach vector.

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:32.800
Affirmative, Rodger Young.

01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:35.680
One-zero-zero-niner-five-two.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:36.930
Welcome back.

01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:40.560
My God.

01:08:42.479 --> 01:08:44.560
How could this happen?

01:08:44.649 --> 01:08:47.020
We thought we were smarter
than the bugs.

01:09:04.330 --> 01:09:06.210
Give me something, please!

01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.710
It hurts!

01:09:14.010 --> 01:09:15.390
Be right with you.

01:09:17.850 --> 01:09:19.220
Help me.

01:09:26.189 --> 01:09:28.770
It's strange. There's
almost no wounded at all.

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:30.899
Bugs don't take prisoners.

01:09:39.990 --> 01:09:41.370
Oh, no.

01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:44.160
Look.

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:50.840
- Carmen...
- See it? Right there.

01:10:12.530 --> 01:10:15.280
- There he is.
- Come on, we'll just wake him up.

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.780
Hey, Johnny! Hey!

01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:22.790
- Hey, Rico!
- Hey, Johnny!

01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:24.830
- Hey, Rico! - Wake up!
- How you doin', fish boy?

01:10:24.870 --> 01:10:27.460
Hey, look.
You're dead!

01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:29.840
Killed in action!

01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:34.130
- Three more days.
- Three days.

01:10:34.210 --> 01:10:36.220
- And you're out.
- Good as new. See you later.

01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:37.630
Bye.

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:08.580
So what do you hear
about our new unit?

01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:11.080
Roughnecks killed more bugs
than any other outfit on Big K.

01:11:11.170 --> 01:11:14.000
Yeah, well, I hear their
lieutenant's a real nutbuster.

01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:18.680
Who's top kick?

01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:22.850
You want the job, huh?

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:24.260
I wouldn't mind.

01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:26.230
I would.

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.020
Just doing my part.

01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.560
Orders.

01:11:33.190 --> 01:11:34.610
Yours?

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:36.440
Where you been besides Big K?

01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:40.410
- Outer rings, Zegema Beach.
- Zegema Beach?

01:11:40.490 --> 01:11:42.870
- I always wanted to go there.
- Good luck.

01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:48.040
- It's not there any more.
- So, I hear your lieutenant's a real nutbuster.

01:11:51.130 --> 01:11:53.880
No one talks about
the lieutenant that way.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.420
- He saved my life.
- Mine too.

01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.680
- Same for me.
- Me too.

01:12:01.470 --> 01:12:04.390
Well, sounds like
he's quite a guy.

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:06.140
Who do you think
saved your ass?

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:10.770
Stand by.
Attention on deck!

01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:25.240
This is for you new people.

01:12:25.330 --> 01:12:27.370
I only have one rule:

01:12:27.450 --> 01:12:30.830
Everyone fights.
No one quits.

01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:33.920
You don't do your job,
I'll shoot you.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:35.250
Do you get me?

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:37.340
We get you, sir!

01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:41.470
- Welcome to the Roughnecks.
- Rasczak's Roughnecks!

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:44.800
At ease. Listen up.

01:12:44.890 --> 01:12:48.470
We got a new Sky Marshal
and a new battle plan.

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:50.980
We're gonna clean out the
systems outlying Klendathu...

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:53.230
one planet at a time.

01:12:53.310 --> 01:12:55.480
Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:59.990
After Fleet glasses
the planet, MI mops up.

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:01.320
Carry on.

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:54.160
All right.
Spread out!

01:13:54.250 --> 01:13:57.920
Fire teams! You locate
a bug hole, nuke it.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.680
Watkins, shake out
Flores and Rico.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.100
Copy that.
Move out!

01:14:10.180 --> 01:14:13.020
First platoon,
we're going for that ridge.

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:16.020
- Levy, you're with me.
- No, I'm in A Squad. I'm going with Rico.

01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:17.600
Shut up and follow me!

01:14:56.020 --> 01:14:57.850
Hey, you like that?

01:14:57.940 --> 01:14:59.940
Fungus-sucking sack
of maggot puke!

01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:01.610
It's dead, Watkins!
It's dead!

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:09.021
Ain't much to look at after
you scrape them off your boot.

01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:13.290
Bug hole. There.

01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:29.220
Nuke 'em, Rico!

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:36.680
Fire in the hole!

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.820
Watkins, we're under
heavy attack. Position M-4.

01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:53.160
- Get over here!
- Move!

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:06.260
- You got a bug problem, ma'am?
- Ah, stow it, trooper!

01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.900
Tanker!

01:16:29.990 --> 01:16:33.070
- Oh, shit!
- Come on! Move!

01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:43.710
Get down!

01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.050
Come on!

01:18:01.370 --> 01:18:03.460
Stay down, sucker!

01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:05.460
- Gillespie.
- Well done!

01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:07.130
Call for retrieval.

01:18:07.210 --> 01:18:10.300
- Medic!
- Nice moves.

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:12.630
Where'd you learn how
to do that, soldier?

01:18:12.710 --> 01:18:15.800
Back in school, sir.
Don't you remember?

01:18:15.880 --> 01:18:19.890
- I was captain of the team.
- Rico?

01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:22.720
- Sir.
- I need a corporal.

01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:26.400
You're it until you're dead
or till I find somebody better.

01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:29.310
Thank you, sir.

01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:32.070
- All right, saddle up! Show's over.
- Way to go, Corporal.

01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:37.490
- Hey, I need a squad leader.
- Oh, no. No, I've been there and blew it.

01:18:37.570 --> 01:18:38.990
I'm just here to fight.

01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:42.450
What about it, Diz?

01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:44.790
First sergeant,
get your gear in section...

01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:46.500
Looks like I'm your girl, sir.

01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:53.050
- Catch you later.
- All right.

01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:00.930
Listen up!

01:19:01.010 --> 01:19:04.220
I expect the best,
and I give the best!

01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:09.400
Here's the beer!

01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:15.400
Here's the entertainment!

01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:21.910
Have fun!
That's an order!

01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:24.580
This one's for me!

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.580
Thank you, Lieutenant!

01:19:31.290 --> 01:19:32.630
Rico!

01:19:34.090 --> 01:19:36.170
You kill bugs good.

01:19:36.260 --> 01:19:37.590
Thanks.

01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:41.760
You knew the lieutenant
before the war.

01:19:41.850 --> 01:19:43.760
What was he like?

01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:46.930
He was a teacher.
Kind of like he knew it all.

01:19:47.020 --> 01:19:49.100
He always had
this little smile.

01:19:49.190 --> 01:19:52.610
Yeah, well, he don't
smile much any more.

01:19:52.690 --> 01:19:56.440
Yeah, well, I guess your bottle fills up
real quick when your kids get smeared.

01:19:56.530 --> 01:19:58.990
- Come on, Corporal.
- Ah, nah, I don't do that any more.

01:19:59.070 --> 01:20:01.570
I remember when you used to dance.
Come on.

01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:03.080
Do I have to pull rank?

01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:07.410
Excuse me, sir.

01:20:16.210 --> 01:20:21.300
Rico. You once asked me
for advice. Want some now?

01:20:21.390 --> 01:20:24.100
- Yes, sir.
- Lieutenant, HQ is on the com.

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.600
Never pass up a good thing.

01:20:37.570 --> 01:20:40.200
Watkins. Beer?

01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:53.710
Ace.

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:05.300
So, Rico, what are you
doing after the dance?

01:21:52.940 --> 01:21:54.310
What's so funny?

01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:58.020
You know, just the way
things work out.

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:18.040
We finally got together, Diz.

01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:22.710
I love you, Johnny.

01:22:33.310 --> 01:22:34.560
Rico!

01:22:37.310 --> 01:22:40.150
We're moving out. There's been a distress
call from General Owen on Planet P.

01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:42.400
So get your shit wired
and report in ten minutes.

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.900
Yes, sir.

01:22:43.990 --> 01:22:45.490
Who's that with you?

01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:51.160
Flores, sir.

01:22:52.330 --> 01:22:54.410
Make it 20 minutes.

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:55.660
Yes, sir.

01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.250
Twenty minutes?

01:22:59.420 --> 01:23:00.750
We can do it.

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.790
Whiskey Outpost, do you copy?

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.920
This is Roughneck 2-0
on tac three. Come in, please.

01:23:45.210 --> 01:23:46.630
Whiskey Outpost,
Whiskey Outpost,

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.970
this is Roughneck 2-0
on tac three.

01:23:49.050 --> 01:23:51.300
- Any contact with General Owen?
- No, sir.

01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:52.810
Not even
the transponder signal.

01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:56.310
It's these canyons.
Go to higher ground, Sergeant.

01:24:02.270 --> 01:24:04.150
Whiskey Outpost,
Whiskey Outpost...

01:24:04.230 --> 01:24:06.070
this is Roughneck 2-0 on...

01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:11.160
Look out!

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.790
Sugar, your weapon.

01:24:26.590 --> 01:24:28.800
Help me! Help me!

01:24:39.100 --> 01:24:42.690
I'd expect anyone in this unit
to do the same for me.

01:24:44.060 --> 01:24:45.820
- Rico.
- Sir.

01:24:45.900 --> 01:24:47.900
You're acting sergeant.
Move 'em out.

01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:52.160
You heard the lieutenant!
Saddle up!

01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:47.340
Jeez, someone really
humped the bunk.

01:25:47.420 --> 01:25:49.630
- Watkins.
- Sir.

01:25:49.710 --> 01:25:52.050
Secure this compound.
Police these bodies.

01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:55.300
Yes, sir. Give me three
up on the tower, now!

01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:57.350
- Aye-aye.
- OP there! OP there!

01:25:57.430 --> 01:26:00.100
- Away!
- Number Two, police up these bodies!

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:02.140
- Stinks in there.
- Second squad, come with me on the gate!

01:26:02.230 --> 01:26:04.480
- Rico! - Churchill, come with me!
- Yes, sir.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.150
We need retrieval.
This place crawls.

01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:08.480
Get somebody in the communications tent
and get me an uplink.

01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:10.440
Yes, sir.
Diz, check it out.

01:26:10.530 --> 01:26:11.940
- Roger.
- Command group with me.

01:26:16.570 --> 01:26:17.830
Ah, shit.

01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:19.280
Lieutenant!

01:26:21.750 --> 01:26:24.960
Dirty bugs came in right
while they were having chow.

01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:33.470
Yeah, this is
where they got in.

01:26:35.090 --> 01:26:37.340
Lieutenant.

01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:40.140
I think you're gonna
want to see this.

01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:41.810
What do you got, Flores?

01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:43.730
God, I hate this place.

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:01.200
What does that look like
to you, Rico?

01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:05.750
Looks like a bug was
in his brain, sir.

01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:18.180
They sucked his brains out.

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.940
Open that.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:34.280
Officer on the deck!

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:36.860
- Pick up the general.
- Gone?

01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:38.551
Is it safe? We've got
to get out of here!

01:27:38.610 --> 01:27:40.870
- General!
- We've gotta... - Sir!

01:27:44.290 --> 01:27:48.120
Thank God for you, all of you.

01:27:48.210 --> 01:27:51.460
You're all gonna be heroes.
Every last one of you.

01:27:51.540 --> 01:27:54.050
- Close that hole.
- Yes, sir.

01:27:54.130 --> 01:27:57.300
I had to evade capture. The security
of the Federation was at stake.

01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:58.720
Fire in the hole!

01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:03.970
I have operational knowledge
of what we're up to out here.

01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:06.480
- Flores, I need that uplink.
- Working on it, sir.

01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.560
- Damn it.
- See?

01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:10.310
- They get in your mind.
- Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0.

01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:11.980
- Look, they did it to Farley.
- Do you read?

01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:14.150
- They got in his mind.
- Come in, Battlegroup. This is Roughneck 2-0.

01:28:14.230 --> 01:28:17.320
They make you do things.
They made Farley call headquarters.

01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:19.150
The distress call was a trap.

01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:22.620
They're just like us.
They want to know what makes us tick.

01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:24.660
They want to know us,
so they can kill us.

01:28:24.740 --> 01:28:26.660
Roughnecks, this is lead.
Prepare for attack.

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:29.080
- I repeat, we're gonna be attacked.
- Where's the retrieval boat?

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:32.080
Mayday. Mayday. This is Roughneck 2-0
to Battlegroup. Do you read?

01:28:32.170 --> 01:28:34.000
- Oh, God!
- Come in, Battlegroup. This is Roughneck 2-0.

01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:37.010
We're gonna die!
Don't you understand?

01:28:37.090 --> 01:28:38.420
We're all gonna die!

01:28:40.010 --> 01:28:41.430
Second squad, follow me!

01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:44.470
- Control yourself, General.
- I can't.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.100
I can't.

01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:47.810
I wish you'd just shoot me.

01:28:50.190 --> 01:28:53.610
Lieutenant! He's just a little
out of his mind, sir.

01:28:54.860 --> 01:28:56.780
Bugs! Bugs!

01:28:56.860 --> 01:28:59.110
- Die!
- All right.

01:28:59.190 --> 01:29:02.110
Warm it all up!
Everything you've got!

01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:04.280
- Move!
- Come on, you apes!

01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:05.950
You want to live forever?

01:29:08.250 --> 01:29:09.620
- Here!
- I got bugs!

01:29:40.030 --> 01:29:41.360
Fire at will!

01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:23.200
Incoming!

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:42.260
Down!

01:30:45.970 --> 01:30:47.220
No! Hey!

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:55.140
- Watch your fire!
- Watch casualties!

01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:57.440
Rico, where's my communication?

01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.610
- Diz, status on the uplink!
- Give me a minute.

01:30:59.690 --> 01:31:01.570
We don't have a minute!

01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:12.950
Battlegroup, this is Roughneck 2-0.
We are under...

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:16.120
- This is Rodger Young. Go ahead.
- We are under attack, sir. We need retrieval now!

01:31:16.210 --> 01:31:17.620
We have Planet Pas clear.

01:31:17.710 --> 01:31:19.790
This place crawls, sir.
We need pickup now!

01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:22.130
- What's your position?
- Come down on this transmission.

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:23.800
Inside the outpost?
That's crazy!

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.760
Well, I hope you have
a crazy pilot. Out!

01:31:58.330 --> 01:31:59.960
Lieutenant!

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.630
Boat coming down, sir!

01:32:01.710 --> 01:32:05.210
Fall back into the compound!
Fall back!

01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:32.570
Hold here!
Hold what you've got!

01:32:43.250 --> 01:32:44.590
Running low!

01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:47.340
I'm out!

01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:49.680
Here! Make 'em count!

01:33:09.110 --> 01:33:11.030
Make cover fire!
Fall back!

01:33:27.130 --> 01:33:28.880
Move, move, move!

01:33:31.300 --> 01:33:33.800
Fall back to the boat!
Haul ass!

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:49.570
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:55.820
- Get him outta there!
- Pull! - Come on!

01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:04.120
Rico! Rico!

01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:08.750
- You know what to do!
- Yes, sir!

01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:15.090
Do it, Rico!

01:34:40.370 --> 01:34:42.960
- Yeah!
- Dizzy!

01:35:04.810 --> 01:35:06.560
No!

01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:09.440
Ace, help me!
Hold her down!

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:16.570
Move!
Get her into the boat!

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.950
Come on, Diz!
Don't die on me!

01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:21.510
Let's get her out!
Let's go, let's go!

01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:29.460
Let's go! Get aboard!

01:35:31.090 --> 01:35:32.960
Tower, let's go!

01:35:39.090 --> 01:35:43.020
Let's move it, tower!
Run!

01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:50.440
Lift off!

01:36:21.050 --> 01:36:25.520
- Johnny, I'm dying-dying.
- No.

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.770
You're gonna be all right, Diz.

01:36:27.850 --> 01:36:31.020
It's all right...

01:36:31.100 --> 01:36:33.570
because I got to have you.

01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:43.080
Johnny, don't let me go!

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:44.910
Joh... Joh...

01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:47.000
Don't let...
Don't let...

01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:09.430
This is traffic control. Proceed
on vector five-niner-two-two-seven.

01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.270
I think you should know...

01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:16.820
your friend Rico is back there.

01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:29.830
Get on the com and tell Fleet
to glass that rock.

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:31.620
On whose authority, Corporal?

01:37:31.710 --> 01:37:34.790
That would be mine, sir.
I assumed command of the mission.

01:37:36.210 --> 01:37:38.670
Rodger Young,
we have an official request...

01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:41.880
by the Mobile Infantry
to commence bombardment of Planet P.

01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:45.640
I thought you were dead.

01:37:45.720 --> 01:37:48.810
I'm not, but a lot
of my troopers are.

01:37:48.890 --> 01:37:50.850
Negative on your request,
DeRuyter.

01:37:50.930 --> 01:37:53.150
The Sky Marshal has
other plans for Planet P.

01:37:53.230 --> 01:37:54.480
Welcome back.

01:37:54.560 --> 01:37:57.650
MI does the dying.
Fleet just does the flying.

01:37:57.730 --> 01:37:59.650
Hold on.
Something's up.

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:02.240
Fleet's mobilized
for a big operation.

01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:33.100
Attention on deck!

01:38:40.190 --> 01:38:42.110
Once somebody asked me...

01:38:42.190 --> 01:38:44.610
if I knew the difference
between a citizen...

01:38:44.700 --> 01:38:46.620
and a civilian.

01:38:46.700 --> 01:38:48.280
I can tell you now.

01:38:48.370 --> 01:38:50.450
A citizen has the courage...

01:38:50.540 --> 01:38:55.040
to make the safety of the human race
their personal responsibility.

01:38:59.210 --> 01:39:01.630
Dizzy was my friend.

01:39:01.710 --> 01:39:03.840
She was a soldier.

01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:05.800
But more than that...

01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:08.300
she was a citizen
of the Federation.

01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:12.640
Present arms!

01:39:31.160 --> 01:39:33.950
Order arms!

01:39:37.330 --> 01:39:39.080
Left face!

01:39:53.180 --> 01:39:55.270
- Officer on deck!
- Carry on.

01:39:56.850 --> 01:39:59.560
Burial detail dismissed.

01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:08.780
At ease.

01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:12.120
- How are you, Carl?
- Carmen, good.

01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:15.120
Johnny, I'm sorry it had
to be your unit on P.

01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:17.660
That mission had a very low
survival probability.

01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:19.790
The bugs laid a trap
for us, didn't they?

01:40:21.210 --> 01:40:23.630
Elegant proof
of intelligence, isn't it?

01:40:23.710 --> 01:40:26.170
We thought there might be
a Brain Bug on P.

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:28.180
You knew, and you
sent them anyway?

01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:31.640
We couldn't afford to launch an
operation if there wasn't one.

01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:36.980
You don't approve.
Well, too bad.

01:40:37.060 --> 01:40:38.980
We're in this for the species,
boys and girls.

01:40:39.060 --> 01:40:41.440
It's simple numbers.
They have more.

01:40:41.520 --> 01:40:43.270
And every day I have
to make decisions...

01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:46.190
that send hundreds of people
like you to their deaths.

01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.650
Didn't they tell you, Colonel?

01:40:48.740 --> 01:40:51.070
That's what the Mobile
Infantry is good for.

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:53.950
I hope you're ready for more.

01:40:54.030 --> 01:40:57.330
We're going back to P
to capture that Brain.

01:40:59.370 --> 01:41:02.130
The Roughnecks
are always ready, sir.

01:41:02.210 --> 01:41:04.840
I hear they need a new lieutenant.
Want the job?

01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:08.920
I'll take it, till I get killed
or you find someone better.

01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:14.300
Attention. All personnel
report to your stations.

01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:17.810
- Well...
- Prepare for drop in 75 minutes.

01:41:17.890 --> 01:41:19.690
Take care of yourself, Johnny.

01:41:19.770 --> 01:41:21.560
I'll see you again.

01:41:34.740 --> 01:41:36.410
Officer on deck!

01:41:53.840 --> 01:41:57.430
- Who are all these kids?
- We got reinforced.

01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:59.730
Most of them are
fresh out of boot.

01:41:59.810 --> 01:42:01.640
We're the old men, Ace.

01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:06.270
This is for all you new people.

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:08.610
I only have one rule:

01:42:08.690 --> 01:42:11.780
Everyone fights.
No one quits.

01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:14.950
If you don't do your job,
I'll kill you myself.

01:42:15.030 --> 01:42:16.330
Do you get me?

01:42:16.410 --> 01:42:18.450
We get you, sir!

01:42:18.540 --> 01:42:23.210
- Welcome to the Roughnecks.
- Rico's Roughnecks!

01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:28.420
Today we're gonna pay
a visit to Bug City.

01:42:28.500 --> 01:42:31.800
We're lookin' for a bug
no one's ever seen before.

01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:33.720
Some kind of smart bug.

01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:41.600
And it probably knows
we're comin'.

01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:45.600
- Saddle up!
- Saddle up now!

01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:47.560
Come on!
Run, run, run, run, run!

01:42:59.030 --> 01:43:00.990
Evasive action.

01:43:24.350 --> 01:43:26.150
Get us clear for warp,
Number Two.

01:43:26.230 --> 01:43:28.650
Clear in five, four...

01:43:28.730 --> 01:43:30.690
- Initiating star drive...
- Three... - in five.

01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:57.300
This is Rodger Young. We're going down
Repeat, this is Rodger Young.

01:43:57.380 --> 01:44:00.800
- Get out! - We're going down.
- Abandon ship! Come on!

01:44:02.220 --> 01:44:04.310
Carmen! Oh!

01:44:04.390 --> 01:44:07.140
- Zander!
- Here!

01:44:07.230 --> 01:44:10.360
- We've got to get to the rescue deck!
- Come on!

01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:28.250
Captain!

01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:34.090
Abandon ship.
That's an...

01:44:35.590 --> 01:44:38.180
She's dead, Carmen.
She's dead!

01:44:55.530 --> 01:44:58.360
Go! Here!

01:45:13.790 --> 01:45:15.170
Follow me!

01:45:26.890 --> 01:45:28.060
Ready?

01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:35.900
Hit it!

01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:56.300
Life pod Bravo 6-3,
two aboard.

01:46:03.930 --> 01:46:08.600
Scanning for a landing zone!
Checking terrain. Here!

01:46:08.680 --> 01:46:10.770
- Can you handle that?
- Piece of cake.

01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:17.110
- We've lost the Rodger Young!
- What is your position?

01:46:17.190 --> 01:46:20.780
Flight Command, we have confirmation.
The Rodger Young is down.

01:46:20.860 --> 01:46:22.610
- Oh. Johnny!
- This is Flight Command.

01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:24.780
Please repeat.
Please repeat.

01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:28.450
- Johnny!
- We now have confirmation. Rodger Young is down.

01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:30.500
- I repeat, Rodger Young is down.
- Rodger Young just burned up.

01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:33.960
- It's on the rescue net.
- Life pod Bravo 6-3, two aboard.

01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.960
- Is anyone receiving?
- Any survivors? - Is anyone receiving?

01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:39.670
- Well, they're getting tarred up there pretty bad.
- Life pod...

01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:41.130
Bravo 6-3, two aboard.

01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:42.800
Is anyone receiving?

01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:44.320
- Is anyone receiving?
- Affirmative.

01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:45.840
This is Roughneck 2-0.

01:46:45.930 --> 01:46:47.470
You're breaking up.
Say again.

01:46:47.550 --> 01:46:49.930
- Carmen?
- Say again. I'm losing you.

01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:51.350
Carmen!

01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:56.650
Prepare for landing.

01:46:56.730 --> 01:46:58.570
Retros in three...

01:46:58.650 --> 01:47:01.150
two, one, fire!

01:47:17.210 --> 01:47:19.000
Carmen. Carmen.

01:47:19.090 --> 01:47:21.260
- Hey, are you okay?
- Uh-huh.

01:47:21.340 --> 01:47:22.760
Get out.
Get out.

01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:36.520
This is Roughneck 2-0. Are you
receiving? Over. This is Roughneck 2-0.

01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:40.070
- Carmen, are you receiving? -Johnny, is that you?
- Yeah!

01:47:40.150 --> 01:47:42.860
- It's me! Wh-What's your position and situation?
- Yeah.

01:47:42.940 --> 01:47:44.570
We're in Bug City,
20 metres underground.

01:47:44.650 --> 01:47:47.910
Position:
South 42, east 118.

01:47:47.990 --> 01:47:50.030
Situation is...

01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:51.910
I repeat.
South 42, east 118.

01:47:51.990 --> 01:47:54.410
What's your situation?
Over.

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:55.870
Carmen.

01:47:58.130 --> 01:48:00.040
Situation is extremely hostile.

01:48:04.970 --> 01:48:06.930
I need a squad to pull 'em out!

01:48:07.010 --> 01:48:09.220
- Direction?
- Three clicks, south by southwest.

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.390
Look out!

01:48:36.330 --> 01:48:38.830
- What do you wanna do?
- You heard the lieutenant.

01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:43.250
Rescue party!
Third squad, come with me!

01:48:43.340 --> 01:48:45.760
Cancel that!

01:48:45.840 --> 01:48:48.590
You know as well as I do,
she's already dead.

01:48:52.010 --> 01:48:53.350
Sorry, buddy.

01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:58.940
Roughnecks, let's move.

01:48:59.020 --> 01:49:01.100
All right.

01:49:15.870 --> 01:49:17.790
Why didn't they kill us?

01:49:17.870 --> 01:49:20.040
They want us alive.

01:50:14.010 --> 01:50:16.350
We should go this way.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:20.100
A Company's that way.

01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:24.440
Yeah, but Carmen's down there.

01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:27.860
Hey, I hate to be rude, buddy,
but word has it she's dead.

01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:30.610
She's still alive.

01:50:30.690 --> 01:50:32.950
How do you know?

01:50:33.030 --> 01:50:35.740
- I don't know how I know, but I know.
- Listen.

01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:38.240
You got command,
but going off mission...

01:50:38.330 --> 01:50:40.700
- That's a serious offence.
- Yeah.

01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:42.750
I think they hang you for that.

01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:48.800
Roughneck 2-0,
proceed on mission.

01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:51.510
I need two volunteers.

01:52:02.330 --> 01:52:03.830
One day...

01:52:03.910 --> 01:52:06.330
someone like me...

01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:08.170
is gonna kill you...

01:52:08.250 --> 01:52:10.380
and your whole fucking race.

01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:10.600
You know what this is?

01:53:13.610 --> 01:53:14.940
Sure you do.

01:53:16.530 --> 01:53:19.110
You're some kind
of big, fat, smart bug...

01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:20.530
aren't you?

01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:24.740
Come on.

01:53:36.130 --> 01:53:37.920
This is Roughneck 2-0.

01:53:38.010 --> 01:53:41.640
Brain Bug sighted moving
west of grid five.

01:53:43.890 --> 01:53:45.310
Run!

01:54:15.420 --> 01:54:17.880
Go! Go!

01:54:17.960 --> 01:54:21.430
- Give me the nuke!
- You trying to be a hero, Watkins?

01:54:23.590 --> 01:54:26.970
I'm trying to kill
some bugs, sir!

01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:30.230
Get outta here!
Get outta here!

01:54:31.770 --> 01:54:33.100
Move!

01:54:37.780 --> 01:54:41.030
Come on! You like that?
You like that? Come on!

01:54:41.110 --> 01:54:42.450
You want a little more?

01:54:45.870 --> 01:54:49.150
You like that? You like that? You like that?
You like that? You want a little more?

01:54:55.170 --> 01:54:56.380
Come on! Come on!

01:55:01.720 --> 01:55:03.050
Come on, come on, come on!

01:55:27.570 --> 01:55:28.780
Come on, Carmen.

01:55:41.090 --> 01:55:43.630
- We did it!
- We won!

01:55:48.930 --> 01:55:51.180
- What's going on?
- They got it!

01:55:51.270 --> 01:55:52.430
Come on!

01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:09.990
Pull! Pull! Pull!

01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:23.920
Quiet!

01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:37.730
What's it thinking, Colonel?

01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:57.080
It's afraid.

01:56:58.540 --> 01:56:59.830
It's afraid!

01:57:03.920 --> 01:57:07.300
- Come on.
- Yeah!

01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:09.800
Carl! Carl! Hey!

01:57:09.890 --> 01:57:12.810
Well, look who's here.
You made it. Good.

01:57:12.890 --> 01:57:16.180
It was you, wasn't it?
You told me how to find Carmen.

01:57:16.270 --> 01:57:17.770
Well, that's classified.

01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:22.650
You know, whenever
the three of us are together...

01:57:22.730 --> 01:57:25.650
I feel like things
might just work out.

01:57:25.730 --> 01:57:27.650
I hope you're right, Carmen.

01:57:27.740 --> 01:57:30.660
We've got one of their Brains now.
Pretty soon we'll know how they think.

01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:33.330
And then we'll know
how to beat them.

01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:35.490
One day it will all be over...

01:57:35.580 --> 01:57:38.500
and everyone will forget
that this was the moment.

01:57:38.580 --> 01:57:41.500
This is when it turned.

01:57:41.580 --> 01:57:45.670
And it wasn't the mighty Fleet,
it wasn't some fancy new weapon.

01:57:49.590 --> 01:57:52.680
It was a drill instructor named Zim
who captured a Brain.

01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:54.350
Come on!
Who am I?

01:57:54.430 --> 01:57:56.560
- Yeah!
- Zim?

01:57:57.980 --> 01:58:00.310
He got him! Yeah!

01:58:00.390 --> 01:58:02.650
Zim. Zim got the bug.

01:58:02.730 --> 01:58:04.310
Zim got the bug, man!

01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:07.690
- Good job, Sergeant.
- Thank you, sir.

01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:12.610
- That would be private, sir.
- Carry on, Private.

01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:15.330
- Yes, sir!
- Yeah!

01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:22.830
What mysteries
will the Brain Bug reveal?

01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:27.840
Federal scientists are working
around the clock to probe its secrets.

01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:31.430
Once we understand the bug,
we will defeat it.

01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:39.100
We have the ships.

01:58:39.180 --> 01:58:40.520
We have the weapons.

01:58:42.020 --> 01:58:44.020
We need soldiers.

01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:46.360
Soldiers like
Lieutenant Stack Lumbrezer.

01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:48.530
We're over the target
area now, Captain.

01:58:48.610 --> 01:58:51.780
- And Captain Carmen Ibanez.
- This is the captain speaking.

01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:53.530
All personnel prepare for drop.

01:58:53.610 --> 01:58:56.370
Soldiers like Private Ace Levy
and Lieutenant John Rico.

01:58:56.450 --> 01:58:59.950
Come on, you apes!
You wanna live forever?

01:59:00.040 --> 01:59:01.500
We need you all.
