00:33.033 --> 00:34.860
<i>Previously on</i>
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:34.860 --> 00:37.124
- Where are we?
- Not where. When.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.473
<i>RAYNER:
It's a time bug--
they're designed</i>

00:38.473 --> 00:39.996
<i>to paralyze an enemy's ship</i>

00:39.996 --> 00:42.129
<i>by randomly cycling them
through time.</i>

00:42.129 --> 00:44.000
The whole point is
to keep us stuck.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.306
This has to be Moll and L'ak.

00:45.306 --> 00:46.481
So, they know
exactly where we are

00:46.481 --> 00:47.917
and where the next clue is.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.223
And once we're ahead
of <i>Discovery,</i>

00:49.223 --> 00:52.095
we can get the next clue
and the next.

00:52.095 --> 00:53.488
We've got this.

00:53.488 --> 00:56.317
We are gonna find
the Progenitors' tech.

00:56.317 --> 00:59.233
No more running
and no more bounty on our heads.

00:59.233 --> 01:02.236
- We'll be free.
- Free sounds good.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.368
<i>ZORA:
The outcome you feared
came to pass.</i>

01:04.368 --> 01:06.196
Is that ship Breen?

01:06.196 --> 01:09.504
<i>Yes. Somehow they got
the Progenitors' technology.</i>

01:09.504 --> 01:12.420
They must have been
Moll and L'ak's highest bidders.

01:13.682 --> 01:15.814
That's Moll.
She's the daughter of my mentor

01:15.814 --> 01:19.166
Cleveland Booker IV,
which, I suppose,

01:19.166 --> 01:22.125
makes her the closest thing
to family I've got left.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.996
[sighs]
We are back to the present.

01:23.996 --> 01:26.390
We've only lost six hours.

01:26.390 --> 01:29.393
The past hasn't been altered.
We did it.

01:29.393 --> 01:31.439
Let's figure out what's changed
in the last six hours.

01:31.439 --> 01:33.093
Can the DOTs tell us anything?

01:33.093 --> 01:35.486
They did find something,
Captain-- a warp signature.

01:35.486 --> 01:37.619
It matches
with L'ak and Moll's ship.

01:37.619 --> 01:39.186
Where are Moll and L'ak now?

01:39.186 --> 01:40.796
That's the strange thing.
Their trail disappears.

01:40.796 --> 01:43.842
Like they came here
and now they're just gone.

01:43.842 --> 01:45.801
Wherever they are,
that's where the next clue is,

01:45.801 --> 01:47.194
and these are
the right coordinates,

01:47.194 --> 01:48.804
so it's a mystery indeed.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.414
Then let's get to solving it.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.942
<i>BOOK:

<i>My mentor-- the man who gave me
my name, my new life--</i>

02:06.604 --> 02:10.652
<i>he used to say,
"No matter how bad things get,</i>

02:10.652 --> 02:14.482
<i>the one thing
you always have is a choice."</i>

02:14.482 --> 02:16.919
<i>I'd be lying if I said I hadn't
made some questionable ones.</i>

02:16.919 --> 02:18.399
[Grudge meows]

02:18.399 --> 02:21.141
<i>But I've made
some good ones, too.</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:23.752
<i>Which is how I know</i>

02:23.752 --> 02:25.971
<i>it's not too late
for his daughter.</i>

02:28.104 --> 02:30.019
<i>If I can turn things around,</i>

02:30.019 --> 02:32.587
<i>so can she.</i>

02:32.587 --> 02:35.329
<i>Cleveland showed me
how things could be,</i>

02:35.329 --> 02:37.026
<i>who I could be.</i>

02:37.026 --> 02:39.028
<i>And I suppose,</i>

02:39.028 --> 02:41.987
<i>just in doing that,
he saved me.</i>

02:43.032 --> 02:45.165
<i>I owe it to him
to do the same for her.</i>

02:46.731 --> 02:50.735
<i>Today... I may get my chance.</i>

02:51.910 --> 02:54.217
<i>We're at
their last known coordinates.</i>

02:55.262 --> 02:58.308
<i>Seems like
we're about to find them.</i>

03:15.195 --> 03:18.285
All right, Commander Stamets,
Lieutenant Tilly,

03:18.285 --> 03:20.374
- it's all you.
- Thank you, Captain.

03:20.374 --> 03:23.377
When we arrived here at
the coordinates Jinaal gave us,

03:23.377 --> 03:25.988
it seemed there was nothing
but a disperse nebula

03:25.988 --> 03:28.164
and a warp trail
from Moll and L'ak

03:28.164 --> 03:30.427
that disappeared
into empty space.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.995
Emphasis on "seemed."

03:32.995 --> 03:35.519
Now we have a pretty good idea
of where they went.

03:35.519 --> 03:38.392
Zora, adjust the viewscreen
to compensate

03:38.392 --> 03:41.438
for the Lorentzian coefficient
and high-energy spectra.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.788
<i>ZORA:
Of course, Lieutenant.</i>

03:50.447 --> 03:52.188
What is that?

03:52.188 --> 03:55.147
That is a wormhole... of sorts.

03:55.147 --> 03:58.325
We just couldn't see it
until we recalibrated our scans.

03:58.325 --> 04:01.284
<i>We believe it leads to a pocket
of interdimensional space.</i>

04:01.284 --> 04:04.287
<i>The opening
is collapsing and expanding</i>

04:04.287 --> 04:06.855
<i>due to matter-antimatter
chain reactions,</i>

04:06.855 --> 04:08.770
<i>likely caused by the Burn.</i>

04:08.770 --> 04:11.468
That's what we have to pass
through to get to the next clue.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.253
And based on the trajectory
of the warp trail,

04:13.253 --> 04:15.516
Moll and L'ak should be
in there as well.

04:15.516 --> 04:17.518
Nice work, both of you.

04:17.518 --> 04:19.084
Thank you.

04:19.084 --> 04:21.348
Lieutenant Gallo,
what are scans telling us?

04:21.348 --> 04:23.654
GALLO:
Not much. That aperture
is scrambling my readings.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.656
We won't know
what we're dealing with

04:25.656 --> 04:27.397
- until we're on the other side.
<i>- Discovery</i> is too big

04:27.397 --> 04:29.225
to get through.
It'd have to be a shuttle.

04:29.225 --> 04:30.574
Lieutenant Christopher,
will you be able

04:30.574 --> 04:32.228
to maintain comms contact?

04:32.228 --> 04:34.099
I'll do my best, but not knowing
what's inside there,

04:34.099 --> 04:35.753
I can't guarantee it.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.843
Okay, Lieutenant Linus,
prepare a shuttle.

04:38.843 --> 04:41.585
Tell Engineering to boost comms
and fortify shields.

04:41.585 --> 04:44.327
And, Commander Rhys,
have a security team on standby.

04:44.327 --> 04:47.461
I'll go
and I'll bring Book with me.

04:49.941 --> 04:52.422
Commander Rayner,
you have the conn.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.250
Captain Burnham?

04:55.773 --> 04:57.732
A word?

04:57.732 --> 05:00.212
With respect,
it's too risky a mission

05:00.212 --> 05:02.040
for the ship's captain.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.825
Let me take it.

05:03.825 --> 05:06.393
I appreciate the suggestion,
but I need you here on the ship.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.264
Well, at least take
a security team.

05:08.264 --> 05:11.485
Our advantage is Book's
personal connection to Moll.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.051
We bring in a security team,

05:13.051 --> 05:14.923
the implied threat nullifies
that advantage.

05:14.923 --> 05:16.925
I feel the same responsibility
you do.

05:16.925 --> 05:18.405
We both saw a future

05:18.405 --> 05:19.928
where the Breen
destroyed everything,

05:19.928 --> 05:22.104
but that's only
one possible future.

05:22.104 --> 05:24.628
You can't let that cloud
your tactical judgment.

05:24.628 --> 05:26.456
This decision <i>is</i> tactical.

05:26.456 --> 05:30.982
So... what's this really
about for you?

05:32.027 --> 05:34.421
You have permission to be blunt.

05:34.421 --> 05:36.074
As they say
in the <i>Ballad of Krul,</i>

05:36.074 --> 05:38.076
"Serve it
without a grum of osikod."

05:39.730 --> 05:43.430
That is a...
classic work on Kellerun.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.996
I did my research
on your culture,

05:44.996 --> 05:46.607
just like you did on mine.

05:46.607 --> 05:50.524
- So, without "osikod..."
- Nothing to report.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.569
I'm just doing my job.

05:52.569 --> 05:55.659
Part of that is to protect you.

05:56.704 --> 05:59.359
When's the last time you took
the conn from another captain?

06:00.447 --> 06:03.798
Couldn't say. Been a while.

06:03.798 --> 06:06.496
Look, we haven't worked together
very long.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.759
We have different styles,

06:08.759 --> 06:11.371
but I wouldn't want
to disadvantage any mission,

06:11.371 --> 06:13.590
especially not one
this important.

06:13.590 --> 06:16.245
I know you can lead this crew,
Commander.

06:17.812 --> 06:19.466
I believe in you.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.600
You have your orders.

06:34.524 --> 06:36.483
<i>BOOK:
Ship feels good.</i>

06:36.483 --> 06:38.876
Purring like Grudge
when she's killed something.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.318
What do you think you'll say
to Moll if we find them?

06:48.669 --> 06:50.714
Don't know.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.978
Maybe we're not so different.

06:53.978 --> 06:57.460
Me and her, us and them.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.768
Former couriers.
That sort of thing.

07:00.768 --> 07:02.857
Cleveland, of course.

07:04.946 --> 07:07.165
I think I can reach her.

07:08.210 --> 07:11.648
We'll need
to bring them in, either way.

07:14.172 --> 07:15.652
Sounds like
that time bug of theirs

07:15.652 --> 07:17.262
was a real pain in the ass.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.658
Come on.

07:21.658 --> 07:23.791
You must have had some fun
with it,

07:23.791 --> 07:25.967
knowing exactly
what was going to happen.

07:25.967 --> 07:29.274
There were still some surprises.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.499
Closing in on the aperture.

07:36.499 --> 07:38.849
Need to increase our speed.
We're not gonna make it

07:38.849 --> 07:40.764
through the opening in time
at this rate.

07:40.764 --> 07:42.679
Even if I gunned it, we could
still get caught in that thing.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.072
There's a "but" in there,
I hope?

07:44.072 --> 07:45.377
But as soon as I finish charging

07:45.377 --> 07:46.814
the impulse capacitant cells,

07:46.814 --> 07:48.163
I can release them
into the drive coils.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.469
That'll give us a boost.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.861
Just don't burn out our engines.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.515
We still have to get back.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.125
There's an old Kwejian saying.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.953
"Never return from a hunt
without enough bait

07:55.953 --> 07:57.999

And I've followed this conduit
for three decks, including

12:48.985 --> 12:51.205
the quarters of a new ensign
who's very nice

12:51.205 --> 12:55.252
but keeps a Cardassian vole
as a pet. Anyhow...

12:55.252 --> 12:57.646
I have some work to do
in my office.

12:57.646 --> 13:01.258
Um... I'll leave you to it.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.912
Hey, is everything okay?

13:03.913 --> 13:05.959
Yeah, I'm fine.

13:05.959 --> 13:09.092
Okay. Well, you're always there
for everyone else,

13:09.092 --> 13:11.703
so if you ever need
to talk about anything...

13:11.703 --> 13:13.183
Yeah, well...

13:13.183 --> 13:14.881
<i>STAMETS:
Tilly, what's your status?</i>

13:14.881 --> 13:17.753
- Working as fast as I can.
- CULBER: I'm fine.

13:17.753 --> 13:20.887
I'll find you later. I'm fine.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.628
<i>STAMETS:
Well, Rayner's asking
for updates, so, uh,</i>

13:23.628 --> 13:25.630
as soon as you have
any good news, let us know.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.242
- We'll be standing by.
<i>- TILLY: Okay. Will do.</i>

13:28.242 --> 13:31.419
What about
the, uh, graviton-pulse idea?

13:31.419 --> 13:34.074
Yeah, I'm just rechecking
my calculations.

13:34.074 --> 13:35.858
You've done that twice already.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.686
Just want to be sure.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.601
Adira.

13:40.776 --> 13:43.213
The time bug wasn't your fault.

13:43.213 --> 13:46.129
Yeah, well, I brought it
on board, didn't I?

13:47.130 --> 13:49.089
Fix the problem yet?

13:49.089 --> 13:51.091
Um,
Lieutenant Tilly's attempting

13:51.091 --> 13:53.093
to boost the comms signal,

13:53.093 --> 13:55.878
but interference from the
aperture's rapid shuttering...

13:55.878 --> 13:57.880
I don't need to know how
the cake is boiled, Commander.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.490
Kellerun boil their cakes?

13:59.490 --> 14:01.144
Don't knock it till you try it.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.581
Other options,
one sentence or less.

14:03.581 --> 14:08.630
Well, um, we need to find a way
to hold the aperture open.

14:08.630 --> 14:10.110
Then do it.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.375
Not that simple, I get it.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.116
Go on, more words.

14:16.116 --> 14:17.726
We could use
the shield generator

14:17.726 --> 14:19.510
to disrupt
the antimatter reactions,

14:19.510 --> 14:21.948
but the power drain could result

14:21.948 --> 14:24.080
in shorting out
of basic systems, like comms,

14:24.080 --> 14:25.865
which would defeat the purpose.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.869
A graviton pulse would also
do it, but there is a, uh,

14:29.869 --> 14:32.262
43.7% chance of implosion,

14:32.262 --> 14:34.482
meaning that the aperture
would shut forever,

14:34.482 --> 14:36.919
with the captain and Booker
still inside, so we...

14:36.919 --> 14:39.835
We're just... we're trying
to improve those odds, so...

14:41.489 --> 14:46.494
Sir, if I could quote something
you told me recently,

14:46.494 --> 14:49.497
"You're not in this alone."

14:52.761 --> 14:55.198
Sounded better
when you said it.

14:56.243 --> 14:59.289
Find another way
to get comms back, and fast.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.378
If they haven't run
into Moll and L'ak already,

15:01.378 --> 15:03.163
they will soon enough.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.208
And who knows
what kind of mess that'll be?

15:23.444 --> 15:25.402
Holopadds are useless
in here, too.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.100
Uh, we can use
the ship's sensors

15:27.100 --> 15:29.972
to track quantum signatures
from our universe.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.974
<i>That'll help us find the clue</i>

15:31.974 --> 15:33.889
<i>and Moll and L'ak,
if they're here.</i>

15:33.889 --> 15:35.804
You remember the access codes
from your Terran counterpart?

15:35.804 --> 15:39.112
Already there.
Not working.

15:39.112 --> 15:41.984
She must have been dead by the
time the <i>Enterprise</i> got here.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.943
We'll have
to find another way in.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.684
Well, I once hacked
an Andorian transport ship

15:46.684 --> 15:49.818
using a subroutine dodge
through backup logs.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.954
I thought it sounded
rather impressive, myself.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.564
Sorry.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.263
Oh, that was
my brother's station

16:00.263 --> 16:02.352
on the USS <i>Enterprise.</i>

16:03.963 --> 16:07.009
Ever meet the Terran version?

16:07.009 --> 16:08.576
No.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.275
But I'm sure he was just as
ruthless as the rest, though.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.279
[console beeps]

16:16.279 --> 16:18.368
Your hack worked. We're in.

16:18.368 --> 16:20.196
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
you meant to say,

16:20.196 --> 16:22.285
"Book, your idea was amazing.

16:22.285 --> 16:26.376
- You are a hero among men."
- A hero among men.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.644
- Huh. That's weird.
- What?

16:33.644 --> 16:36.125
The intermix chamber was ejected
from the warp drive.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.171
Shuttles and escape pods gone, too.

16:38.171 --> 16:39.824
Captain's logs erased.

16:39.824 --> 16:42.914
Crew abandoned ship.

16:42.914 --> 16:46.266
Evacuation is a last resort
in Terran culture.

16:46.266 --> 16:49.095
<i>Enterprise</i> took some damage,
but it wasn't terminal.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.054
Definitely some sort
of story there.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.448
- Indeed.
- So what's the verdict?

16:54.448 --> 16:56.450
Were you able to find them?

16:56.450 --> 16:57.494
Two signatures on the bridge.
That's us.

16:57.494 --> 16:58.974
Three in sickbay.

16:58.974 --> 17:02.412
That's Moll, L'ak and the clue.

17:03.587 --> 17:05.198
They found it.

17:05.198 --> 17:06.547
Let's get it.

17:09.376 --> 17:12.335
BOOK:
Any idea where they found
the clue in the first place?

17:12.335 --> 17:14.424
BURNHAM:
I saw a trace signature
in the transporter room.

17:14.424 --> 17:16.383
It had to have been there.

17:16.383 --> 17:18.820
BOOK:
Scientists would have
put it there for a reason.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.216
BURNHAM:
Let's check it out.

17:29.309 --> 17:32.529
Bedding, blankets,
kids' clothes?

17:32.529 --> 17:35.315
Not what I would expect
to see on a warship.

17:37.752 --> 17:40.624
Why would someone want us
to see this?

17:48.023 --> 17:50.286
"Light of hope shines

17:50.286 --> 17:52.941
through even the darkest
of nights."

17:55.335 --> 17:58.294
It's the crew's story.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.732
Terran High Chancellor
was killed for trying

18:01.732 --> 18:05.997
to make reforms,
and this crew escaped.

18:05.997 --> 18:07.912
They mutinied.

18:07.912 --> 18:10.306
Brought refugees with them,

18:10.306 --> 18:12.830
who were trying to flee
their universe for ours.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.442
It says...

18:15.442 --> 18:20.969
a Kelpien slave, turned
rebel leader, helped them.

18:21.970 --> 18:24.451
Saru.

18:24.451 --> 18:27.367
Action Saru in any universe.

18:27.367 --> 18:29.151
Well, it's got to be why

18:29.151 --> 18:31.719
the escape pods
and shuttles are gone.

18:31.719 --> 18:34.330
They fled the <i>Enterprise</i>
once it got stuck here.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.203
I hope they made it.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.074
Yeah.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.990
Me, too.

18:42.947 --> 18:45.385
Let's keep moving.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.868
BURNHAM:
Sickbay's over here.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.223
Ready?

19:13.021 --> 19:14.979
Holo doubles.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.286
Clever. Now we won't know
where to shoot.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.419
They must've hacked the room's
holo emitter,

19:19.419 --> 19:21.769
but if we can find it...

19:21.769 --> 19:24.075
BURNHAM:
Got it. Up there.

19:24.075 --> 19:26.382
But I can't hit it
from this angle.

19:26.382 --> 19:29.124
Yeah, two out of the ten blasts
will be real.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.039
I've had worse odds.

19:44.966 --> 19:46.750
Got it.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.275
- Come on.
- Okay.

19:49.275 --> 19:50.450
- [gasps]
- Go!

19:50.450 --> 19:52.582
[weapons firing]

19:52.582 --> 19:54.802
Could have just said "Hello."

19:54.802 --> 19:57.196
You could have just left us
the hell alone.

19:57.196 --> 19:59.546
Lower your phasers.
Let's talk.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.200
You were the ones
who came in firing.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.505
Just at the holo emitter.

20:02.505 --> 20:04.115
Yeah, or your aim's shit.

20:04.115 --> 20:06.422
Your ship is in pieces.

20:06.422 --> 20:09.295
Surrender to us now, let us
get you out of here safely.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.080
[quietly]:
Hey, cover me.

20:13.473 --> 20:15.170
Hey.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.954
Easy.

20:16.954 --> 20:19.000
Okay?

20:19.000 --> 20:20.262
Easy.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.699
Look, we're here to help.

20:22.699 --> 20:24.701
Moll,

20:24.701 --> 20:27.574
- I knew your father.
- [scoffs]

20:28.618 --> 20:30.620
And that's supposed
to make me trust you?

20:30.620 --> 20:34.058
No, but I know the kind
of man he was.

20:34.058 --> 20:36.844
Cleveland Booker was garbage.

20:36.844 --> 20:40.630
And we are not going
to rot in a Federation brig.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.980
You'll get a fair trial.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.158
You do not have
another play here.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.726
Wrong. You may have a shuttle.

20:50.727 --> 20:52.686
We have the clue.

20:54.340 --> 20:57.952
MOLL:
The way I see it, we can
blast away at each other--

20:57.952 --> 21:02.043
probably all end up dead-- or

21:02.043 --> 21:04.611
you give us a ride out of here,
let us go,

21:04.611 --> 21:06.917
and we let you replicate that.

21:06.917 --> 21:09.529
Tempting,
but that's not the clue.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.531
Remember Lyrek?

21:11.531 --> 21:14.882
Decoy stanzas,

21:14.882 --> 21:17.276
the real clue hidden
somewhere else.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.016
They all look different.

21:21.497 --> 21:24.239
Go ahead.
Use that tricorder there.

21:24.239 --> 21:27.242
Calibrate it to scan for quantum
signatures from our universe.

21:27.242 --> 21:30.593
It's the real deal.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.552
BOOK:
We can you get out of here.

21:32.552 --> 21:34.162
All of us.

21:34.162 --> 21:36.425
Whatever trouble you're in...

21:36.425 --> 21:38.253
- You don't know us.
- I know you wouldn't
risk each other's

21:38.253 --> 21:40.516
- lives over latinum...
- Shut up, I said
shut the hell up!

21:40.516 --> 21:41.865
Which means
you must be in real trouble.

21:41.865 --> 21:43.737
Hey, the Federation
can help you!

21:43.737 --> 21:45.434
- Can they erase an <i>Erigah?</i>
- Moll.

21:45.434 --> 21:47.567
No? So stop pretending
like you can do a damn thing!

21:47.567 --> 21:48.872
- Moll!
- What?!

21:48.872 --> 21:52.963
<i>Erigah?</i> You're Breen?

21:58.969 --> 22:02.321
[sighs]
An <i>Erigah</i> is
a Breen blood bounty.

22:06.499 --> 22:08.936
They're after you, aren't they?

22:09.937 --> 22:11.895
That's why you're here.

22:11.895 --> 22:13.941
You hope you can use whatever's
at the end of that clue trail

22:13.941 --> 22:15.464
to get them to release it.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.901
BOOK:
Moll.

22:19.642 --> 22:21.209
What did you do?

22:31.001 --> 22:33.134
<i>MOLL:
I know I'm new around here, but</i>

22:33.134 --> 22:36.267
how much longer are you
bucket-heads gonna make me wait?

22:36.267 --> 22:38.095
Got other deliveries to do.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.923
[speaks Breen]

22:39.923 --> 22:42.361
Am I supposed to be trembling
at this point?

22:42.361 --> 22:43.840
[speaks Breen]

22:45.102 --> 22:46.495
[speaks Breen]

22:48.105 --> 22:50.934
[speaking Breen]

22:51.979 --> 22:54.198
You must be the one
who wanted to talk to me.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.070
Hi. I'm Moll.

22:56.070 --> 22:59.247
I like latinum
and long walks on the beach.

22:59.247 --> 23:01.336
What do you need?

23:01.336 --> 23:04.513
L'AK:
Be silent, courier.

23:04.513 --> 23:06.123
We've had reports

23:06.123 --> 23:07.777
your dilithium's been cut
with impurities.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.649
I need to inspect.

23:09.649 --> 23:11.651
[laughs softly]

23:11.651 --> 23:14.393
Not my deliveries, green eye.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.396
Inspection was not a request.

23:26.666 --> 23:29.495
I've met Bolians
with meaner left hooks.

23:32.367 --> 23:33.934
[both grunting]

23:33.934 --> 23:36.023
No.
You know,

23:36.023 --> 23:39.243
I've learned a thing or two
about Breen insignia.

23:39.243 --> 23:41.332
This one means royalty.

23:41.332 --> 23:43.030
Rumor has it

23:43.030 --> 23:46.163
the Primarch's nephew doesn't
fit the mold around here,

23:46.163 --> 23:48.992
has been demoted
to shuttle bay duty.

23:48.992 --> 23:52.474
That's you, isn't it? L'ak.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.476
[grunts]

23:54.476 --> 23:56.739
Must be so humiliating.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.395
What if I said...

24:00.395 --> 24:02.832
I could help you get payback?

24:02.832 --> 24:05.574
You <i>are</i> cutting the dilithium.

24:08.795 --> 24:12.233
Look, I'm good at what I do.

24:12.233 --> 24:14.235
Great, actually.

24:14.235 --> 24:16.455
Having a partner on the inside

24:16.455 --> 24:18.892
would make it all go
a lot smoother.

24:18.892 --> 24:22.373
I should kill you
for the suggestion.

24:23.374 --> 24:25.376
But you didn't,

24:25.376 --> 24:27.466
which means you're intrigued.

24:32.166 --> 24:34.385
I know

24:34.385 --> 24:38.651
what it's like
to be on the outside, alone.

24:39.652 --> 24:41.480
Makes you hungry.

24:42.481 --> 24:43.699
- Also...
- [click]

24:44.700 --> 24:46.223
...makes you smart.

24:46.223 --> 24:47.486
[footsteps approaching]

24:52.882 --> 24:55.145
Like I said...

24:55.145 --> 24:57.147
smart.

24:57.147 --> 25:00.542
You sure
you want to make a deal?

25:00.542 --> 25:02.936
You don't know anything

Not yet, anyway.

25:14.338 --> 25:15.426
Whatever we did...

25:16.471 --> 25:18.255
...is none
of your damn business.

25:18.255 --> 25:20.693
Love is a powerful thing.

25:20.693 --> 25:23.391
Do not let it
take you down the wrong road.

25:23.391 --> 25:25.088
You both still have choices.

25:25.088 --> 25:28.788
You always have choices.

25:28.788 --> 25:31.138
You're right.

25:31.138 --> 25:33.227
We do.

26:01.037 --> 26:03.518
I could use
an extra pair of hands.

We both want the same thing,
don't we?

26:10.569 --> 26:12.353
To get them out.

26:14.485 --> 26:16.183

26:16.183 --> 26:20.622
One wrong move,
and I will dust you.

26:51.218 --> 26:53.307
Dilithium's clean.

You're free to go.

26:58.051 --> 27:00.183
Sure you don't want
to check my ship again?

27:00.183 --> 27:04.492
Make sure that I didn't smuggle
any tribbles on board?

27:04.492 --> 27:06.494
I wish I could.

27:06.494 --> 27:08.496
My uncle is coming down
for inspection,

27:08.496 --> 27:09.976
and I need to shine my boots.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.717
Is that a euphemism?

27:11.717 --> 27:13.719
No. He just really likes
our boots to be shiny.

27:13.719 --> 27:16.330
- Oh, sounds like an asshole.
- [laughs]

27:16.330 --> 27:17.853
You have no idea.

27:17.853 --> 27:21.901

you made me a promise.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.731
I'll show you next week.

27:25.731 --> 27:28.647
Yes, that is
what you said last week.

You don't like it,
we'll find a courier who does.

27:37.873 --> 27:40.789
Another time, I promise.

27:41.834 --> 27:44.227
Come on.
Show me what you look like.

27:44.227 --> 27:45.838
You've seen my face.

27:45.838 --> 27:48.144
Okay, the other face.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.714
L'ak?

27:52.714 --> 27:55.151
It's just...

27:55.151 --> 27:57.153
It...

27:57.153 --> 28:01.027
It's not... me.

28:01.027 --> 28:04.378
Okay.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.380
But it's...

28:06.380 --> 28:08.643
it's a part of you, right?

28:10.210 --> 28:12.778
Both faces are.

28:16.303 --> 28:19.480

that I hate.

[L'ak sighs]

28:38.804 --> 28:40.849
Hello, L'ak.

28:44.766 --> 28:46.507
Soon as I figure out a way

28:46.507 --> 28:49.771
to bring down the containment
field, this truce is over.

28:49.771 --> 28:52.339
I really do want
to help you, okay?

28:52.339 --> 28:54.689
Says the man
who took my father's name.

28:54.689 --> 28:58.214
Look, I know
he left you and your mother.

28:58.214 --> 29:01.827
I also know that staying away
was the hardest choice

29:01.827 --> 29:03.524
he ever had to make.

29:03.524 --> 29:05.656
But he did it to protect you.

29:05.656 --> 29:06.832
You know, from a dangerous life.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.181
He didn't want it blowing back.

29:08.181 --> 29:10.923
And you bought that?

29:10.923 --> 29:14.840
[laughs]
Let me guess. Daddy issues.

29:16.667 --> 29:21.150
He promised
to get us off Callor Five,

29:21.150 --> 29:24.806
take us to some safe-haven
colony in the Gamma Quadrant.

29:24.806 --> 29:27.853
Described it in perfect detail.

29:27.853 --> 29:30.246
Absolute paradise.

29:30.246 --> 29:34.511
Every night I'd go to sleep
thinking about it.

29:34.511 --> 29:39.821
Then one day,
he just stopped coming home.

29:39.821 --> 29:43.433
My mom had to get a job
in the rubindium mines.

29:43.433 --> 29:46.132
You have any idea
what that's like?

29:48.264 --> 29:51.833
She died when I was 14, and...

29:51.833 --> 29:54.967
I was left completely alone.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.971
I don't think
he knew any of that.

29:59.972 --> 30:04.237
Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.

30:04.237 --> 30:06.326
He's dead now.

30:07.457 --> 30:11.548
And L'ak is the only thing
that matters to me.

30:21.776 --> 30:25.345
Exhausting, huh?
Staring each other down.

30:25.345 --> 30:27.434
What can I say?

30:27.434 --> 30:29.523
I don't trust you.

30:30.567 --> 30:32.961
Do you even know
what you're after?

30:32.961 --> 30:34.789
What all these clues lead to?

30:34.789 --> 30:38.053
"Power beyond
all comprehension,"

30:38.053 --> 30:39.925
is what the diary said.

30:39.925 --> 30:45.017
I don't care, as long as
it can end an <i>Erigah.</i>

30:45.017 --> 30:47.062
If the Breen got ahold
of that power,

30:47.062 --> 30:49.238
it would be catastrophic.

30:49.238 --> 30:51.937
- You have to know that.
- We'll be long gone by then.

30:51.937 --> 30:54.853
Not unless they take it from you
and kill you anyway.

30:57.594 --> 31:00.293
Do you really trust them
more than you trust us?

31:03.862 --> 31:06.777
L'ak, the Federation is all
about second chances.

living proof of that.

31:18.615 --> 31:20.966
would we serve it together?

31:21.967 --> 31:23.882
I can advocate for that.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.362
Because I would rather die

31:26.362 --> 31:28.930
than be separated from her.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.708
Yeah, I really see the appeal.

32:07.708 --> 32:11.103
We were couriers,
like you and L'ak.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.455
I understand it--

32:15.455 --> 32:18.762
depending on someone like that,
knowing they're all you've got.

32:22.157 --> 32:25.552
You know, she was my first real
friend after Cleveland died.

32:25.552 --> 32:27.162
Unless you count Grudge.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.990
But she bites
when I don't feed her,

32:28.990 --> 32:31.950
so, it's a bit one-sided.

32:35.083 --> 32:38.347
He talked about you a lot--
Cleveland.

32:38.347 --> 32:40.436
And the look in his eyes
when he did...

32:40.436 --> 32:43.048
For what it's worth,
he loved you.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.880
But I'm sorry for what you
went through because of him.

32:51.578 --> 32:54.059
I hated my father, too.

32:54.059 --> 32:57.018

we can change our deal.

34:06.870 --> 34:09.699
You never even told me
what's so damn important.

34:09.699 --> 34:12.093
What do you need
so much latinum for anyway?

34:15.140 --> 34:17.142
There's a colony

34:17.142 --> 34:19.100
in the Gamma quadrant.

34:19.100 --> 34:22.364

wake up every day and...

be.

no more watching my back.

Damn it.

40:08.449 --> 40:09.581
I'm here.

40:09.581 --> 40:11.670
You're gonna be okay.

40:13.193 --> 40:14.542
[grunting]

40:14.542 --> 40:16.370
Leave her alone!

40:16.370 --> 40:18.459
Stop! Let me go!

40:18.459 --> 40:20.069
That all you got?

40:20.069 --> 40:22.115
[grunting]

40:23.464 --> 40:25.423
[speaking Breen]

40:27.903 --> 40:29.862
Speak her language.

40:30.906 --> 40:33.213
She deserves to understand
what you're saying.

40:36.042 --> 40:38.827
You carry the genetic code
of the Yod-Thot.

40:38.827 --> 40:40.568
They who rule.

40:40.568 --> 40:43.441
Yet while we campaign
for the throne of the Imperium,

40:43.441 --> 40:45.834
you consort with lesser beings.

40:45.834 --> 40:49.011
And you do so wearing that face.

40:49.011 --> 40:52.101
An insult to your heritage.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.674
This... is Breen.

41:00.806 --> 41:02.851
Then why can we change?

41:04.462 --> 41:07.247
Both faces are part of us.

41:07.247 --> 41:09.945
If we deny half our nature,
we deny it all.

41:10.946 --> 41:13.732
We have evolved
past the need for that form.

41:13.732 --> 41:15.690
Holding it makes you unfocused,

41:15.690 --> 41:17.953
inflexible and weak.

41:22.044 --> 41:24.220
There is only one path

41:24.220 --> 41:26.309
to redemption.

41:43.936 --> 41:46.504
[weapon whirs]

41:49.419 --> 41:51.813
Was fun while it lasted,
green eye.

42:08.134 --> 42:09.875
<i>Erigah.</i>

42:09.875 --> 42:11.616
I know.

42:15.489 --> 42:17.099
Go, now.

42:17.099 --> 42:19.014
Wait. Why didn't you kill him?

42:19.014 --> 42:20.320
He raised me.

42:21.713 --> 42:22.888
[alarm sounding]

42:22.888 --> 42:25.151
Moll, please, go.

42:25.151 --> 42:27.327
Go to Chain territory,
find that colony.

42:27.327 --> 42:28.937
It doesn't matter
what happens to me

42:28.937 --> 42:30.852
as long I know that you're safe.

42:30.852 --> 42:32.506
I asked you to come with me.

42:32.506 --> 42:33.899
I can't.

42:33.899 --> 42:35.291
Not now.

42:35.291 --> 42:37.293
An <i>Erigah</i> is impossible to lift.

42:37.293 --> 42:40.166
They will never stop hunting me.

42:41.210 --> 42:42.690
Us.

42:42.690 --> 42:44.823
They'll be hunting us.

42:47.521 --> 42:50.350
Nothing's impossible, L'ak.

42:50.350 --> 42:52.613
We can do this.

42:52.613 --> 42:55.007
You and me.
[exhales]

42:55.007 --> 42:56.965
Come on, babe.

42:56.965 --> 42:59.402
Let's be happy together.

43:00.665 --> 43:02.667
Please?

43:03.885 --> 43:05.583
Okay.

43:06.932 --> 43:09.021
<i>I love you, Moll.</i>

43:09.021 --> 43:11.632
More than anything.

43:11.632 --> 43:13.025
You know that, right?

43:13.025 --> 43:15.027
No, no, no, no, don't.

43:15.027 --> 43:17.203
Okay? I'll figure this out.

43:17.203 --> 43:19.466
We've made it
through worse before.

43:19.466 --> 43:21.076
We're trapped.

43:21.076 --> 43:24.645
Oh. Nothing's impossible for us.

43:24.645 --> 43:27.387
Okay? I've got this.

43:28.431 --> 43:29.998
I promise.

43:33.828 --> 43:36.352
There should be enough power
left to activate a tractor beam.

43:43.185 --> 43:44.839
Can't save the day
if we can't see.

43:44.839 --> 43:46.058
Nice.

43:47.146 --> 43:49.670
<i>COMPUTER:
Warning, four minutes to impac.</i>

43:49.670 --> 43:52.281
- It's on.
- Here goes nothing.

43:52.281 --> 43:54.675
Lieutenant Christopher,
anything on comms yet?

43:54.675 --> 43:57.112
- Negative, sir. Still trying.
- NAYA: Commander?

43:57.112 --> 43:58.679
There's something happening
at the aperture.

43:58.679 --> 44:00.420
Lieutenant Gallo, enhance it.

44:00.420 --> 44:01.900
Aye, Commander.

44:03.292 --> 44:05.904
Seems to be a... tractor beam?

44:05.904 --> 44:06.992
From the shuttle?

44:06.992 --> 44:08.907
No. Something much larger.

44:08.907 --> 44:11.039
The beam is oscillating,
a repeating pattern.

44:11.039 --> 44:13.041
Three-four-one-four.

44:16.479 --> 44:18.394
Commander Stamets,

44:18.394 --> 44:20.309
Ensign Tal, get in here.

44:20.309 --> 44:22.311
Lieutenant Tilly, you too.

44:22.311 --> 44:24.792
Almost got it, sir,
a way to hold the aperture open.

44:24.792 --> 44:27.273
Tilly rerouted
portions of the EPS grid.

44:27.273 --> 44:29.057
Change of plans.
I need you to hold it open

44:29.057 --> 44:30.319
and make it bigger.

44:30.319 --> 44:31.973
Big enough for a starship.

44:31.973 --> 44:33.496
When you say "big enough
for a starship," do you mean

44:33.496 --> 44:35.150
that <i>Discovery</i> is going in?

44:35.150 --> 44:36.412
No.

44:36.412 --> 44:38.197
Our captain's coming out.

44:49.208 --> 44:50.557
How could you possibly know that

44:50.557 --> 44:52.167
- they're coming out?
<i>- Ballad of Krul.</i>

44:53.386 --> 44:55.083
It doesn't matter.
Can you do it?

44:55.083 --> 44:56.868
That would require
a massive amount of power,

44:56.868 --> 44:59.044
more power than the entire ship
could safely produce.

44:59.044 --> 45:01.786
Well, there's got to be a way.
Come on.

45:01.786 --> 45:04.005
Look, I need ideas, come on!

45:05.964 --> 45:07.574
A cask of Kellerun citrus mash

45:07.574 --> 45:09.271
for whoever lands this, go.

45:09.271 --> 45:11.491
Could we invert
the deflector array

45:11.491 --> 45:13.319
and force the aperture open?

45:13.319 --> 45:15.582
Rerouting energy distribution
systems would take too long.

45:15.582 --> 45:17.062
What if we discharge
the spore reserve?

45:17.062 --> 45:18.977
Hit them with a tachyon pulse?

45:18.977 --> 45:20.500
LINUS:
We should maintain our reserves

45:20.500 --> 45:22.632
in case an emergency jump
is required.

45:22.632 --> 45:24.460
Well, can't we just strap in
and pull power

45:24.460 --> 45:25.984
from gravitational systems?

45:25.984 --> 45:27.855
If they don't reset,
eventually we'll just

45:27.855 --> 45:29.596
- end up floating around.
- Wait a minute.

45:29.596 --> 45:31.946
If we change out
the photon-torpedo payloads

45:31.946 --> 45:34.035
and replace them
with antimatter...

45:34.035 --> 45:36.037
STAMETS:
It would add fuel

45:36.037 --> 45:37.778
to the antimatter reactions
already happening

45:37.778 --> 45:39.301
in the aperture.

45:39.301 --> 45:40.650
And that could generate
the energy we need.

45:40.650 --> 45:43.305
Yes, uh... [stammers]
if we hit it

45:43.305 --> 45:46.091
precisely with a sequential,
hexagonal pattern,

45:46.091 --> 45:49.355
uh, it should stay open
for approximately 60 seconds.

45:49.355 --> 45:51.879
But once it collapses,
it's gone for good.

45:51.879 --> 45:53.228
Why hexagonal?

45:53.228 --> 45:54.795
- Um...
- STAMETS: It doesn't matter.

45:54.795 --> 45:56.275
It'll work.

46:00.192 --> 46:02.107
Citrus mash all around then.

46:02.107 --> 46:04.805
Rhys, coordinate
engineering and munitions,

46:04.805 --> 46:06.676
replace the payloads,
fire on my mark.

46:06.676 --> 46:09.723
Asha, get us into position.
Gallo, lower our shields

46:09.723 --> 46:11.159
so we can catch
that tractor beam.

46:11.159 --> 46:13.074
We're only gonna get
one shot at this.

46:13.074 --> 46:15.033
I trust you'll all
make it count.

46:15.033 --> 46:16.817
- Red alert.
- OTHERS: Aye, Commander.

46:20.647 --> 46:22.388
BOOK:
Tractor beam's holding steady.

46:22.388 --> 46:23.955
No sign of a response yet.

46:23.955 --> 46:26.696
<i>COMPUTER:

46:28.786 --> 46:30.875
Book, in case we don't make it,
I need to say something.

46:30.875 --> 46:32.746
Come on, don't go there.

46:32.746 --> 46:34.617
No.

46:34.617 --> 46:37.490
You were one of the surprises
in the time cycles.

46:37.490 --> 46:38.970
That's all.

46:42.712 --> 46:44.758
It was nice.

46:45.715 --> 46:47.195
And we were happy.

46:54.550 --> 46:56.726
All right,
let's get that thing open.

46:57.771 --> 46:59.817
<i>Fire!</i>

47:10.697 --> 47:13.221
The vessel's tractor beam has
just made contact with us.

47:13.221 --> 47:15.310
RAYNER:
All right, let's pull them out.

47:17.747 --> 47:19.271
We're locked on.

47:19.271 --> 47:21.490
Route whatever power
isn't keeping us breathing

47:21.490 --> 47:23.014
or held down
to that tractor beam.

47:23.014 --> 47:24.885
Hit it?

47:24.885 --> 47:27.192
Uh... feels weird.

47:27.192 --> 47:29.107
Let's just fly.

47:37.115 --> 47:40.379
Is that the ISS <i>Enterprise?</i>

47:41.510 --> 47:42.642
Gallo, how much time do we have

47:42.642 --> 47:44.818
- to get them out?
- 20 seconds.

48:29.950 --> 48:31.343

it's a Terran warp pod.

48:45.183 --> 48:46.662
Two life signs,
sickbay equipment.

48:46.662 --> 48:48.229
It's got to be
a life-support system.

- It's Moll and L'ak.
- Right.

48:50.405 --> 48:52.146
[console buzzes]

48:52.146 --> 48:53.713
- I can't stop them
from launching.
- Me, either.

48:53.713 --> 48:55.236
Commander, can you grab them?

49:23.221 --> 49:25.179

49:29.749 --> 49:31.794
I was impressed.

49:31.794 --> 49:33.622
It was a long shot.

49:33.622 --> 49:35.059
No question.

49:35.059 --> 49:36.843
Great work today.

49:36.843 --> 49:38.888

Ah, but I'm not.

49:46.287 --> 49:47.810
Mm-hmm.

49:49.073 --> 49:50.770
I can do that.

49:50.770 --> 49:52.990
How did it feel being
back in the chair?

49:54.513 --> 49:56.906
Captain's chair is
for the captain.

50:06.307 --> 50:08.440
They deserve it.

50:09.571 --> 50:11.269
They do.

50:12.966 --> 50:14.489
Get some rest, Commander.

50:34.031 --> 50:35.945
It's a bit of a day, huh?

50:35.945 --> 50:38.992
I feel like I've been through a
gormagander's digestive tract.

50:38.992 --> 50:40.298
Mm.

50:40.298 --> 50:42.126
I guess I'm not the only one?

50:42.126 --> 50:44.476
Thanks for noticing, Doc.

50:44.476 --> 50:46.304
Are you here to take me up
on my offer?

50:46.304 --> 50:48.393
'Cause I'm all ears.

50:49.437 --> 50:52.136
Oh, it's a bit, um...

50:54.660 --> 50:56.705
These experiences I've had.

50:58.446 --> 51:00.492
I mean, I died.

51:02.233 --> 51:04.713
I came back to life.

51:04.713 --> 51:06.846
And then with Jinaal,
I was there.

51:08.065 --> 51:09.849
But I wasn't.

51:09.849 --> 51:12.330
It was weird.

51:12.330 --> 51:15.507
That's as close to a scientific
term as I can get for it.

51:17.291 --> 51:19.337
And now we're on this quest...

51:20.729 --> 51:22.296
...to find the thing that...

51:22.296 --> 51:24.081
created us.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.344
I mean, it's all so big.

51:28.172 --> 51:30.391
And impossible to grasp and...

51:33.612 --> 51:36.005
...part of me
kind of loves that.

51:36.005 --> 51:38.095
I think.

51:38.095 --> 51:40.401
As terrifying as it is.

51:40.401 --> 51:41.533
But Paul...

51:41.533 --> 51:43.839
Oh, hates the unknown.

51:43.839 --> 51:46.842
And we've always been able
to find answers together.

51:48.192 --> 51:50.977
I don't know how to talk
to him about this.

51:50.977 --> 51:53.327
Change is hard.

51:54.285 --> 51:56.374
But it can also be freeing.

51:56.374 --> 51:58.289
I know, it's just...

51:59.942 --> 52:02.249
I'm not sure
what all this will look like.

52:03.729 --> 52:06.079
It sounds like he's not the only
one who hates the unknown.

52:06.079 --> 52:08.255
You should talk
to somebody about that.

52:08.255 --> 52:10.388
[chuckles]

52:13.217 --> 52:16.002
They're not really
that far apart.

52:16.002 --> 52:19.005
The intellectual
and the spiritual.

52:20.006 --> 52:22.182
Both reach for understanding.

52:22.182 --> 52:24.402
Both bring us to new places.

52:25.403 --> 52:27.448
But I didn't say "spiritual."

52:27.448 --> 52:29.537
Yeah...

52:29.537 --> 52:31.539
Hugh, you kind of did.

52:43.899 --> 52:46.380
- [door chimes]
- Come.

52:47.381 --> 52:49.340
Anything on Moll and L'ak yet?

52:49.340 --> 52:52.299
Starfleet has every ship
in the sector on high alert.

52:54.823 --> 52:56.303
But we have this.

52:59.176 --> 53:03.658
Paul is prepping to do
a full chemical analysis...

53:03.658 --> 53:05.486
of this vial.

53:05.486 --> 53:07.793
And then...

53:10.926 --> 53:12.885
...we'll have our next stop.

53:12.885 --> 53:15.453
You ever wonder
why there's always a lesson

53:15.453 --> 53:16.889
with these clues?

53:16.889 --> 53:18.499
Like with the itronok.

53:18.499 --> 53:21.459
Do you value life-forms
different than your own?

53:21.459 --> 53:23.548
And with the necropolis planet.

53:23.548 --> 53:26.072
Importance of cultural context.

53:27.378 --> 53:29.597
See, the scientist who left that
on the <i>Enterprise</i> must've

53:29.597 --> 53:31.077
known the history of that ship.

53:31.077 --> 53:32.383
Ha.

53:33.297 --> 53:35.081
She did.

53:35.081 --> 53:36.952
She was Terran.

53:36.952 --> 53:40.304
The ship's junior
science officer, Dr. Cho.

53:40.304 --> 53:42.610
So I had Zora look up
the crew names on the manifest.

53:42.610 --> 53:44.177
Guess what?

53:44.177 --> 53:47.136
Most of them ended up
in Federation databases.

53:48.137 --> 53:49.835
So they did make it.

53:49.835 --> 53:51.010
Mm-hmm.

53:51.010 --> 53:52.968
Started new lives
in our universe.

53:52.968 --> 53:54.405
Yeah.

53:54.405 --> 53:57.364
Dr. Cho even ended up
joining Starfleet.

53:58.452 --> 54:00.715
She become a branch admiral.

54:00.715 --> 54:02.761
After that, her records just...

54:02.761 --> 54:04.676
vanish.

54:04.676 --> 54:06.460
Ah, well, Jinaal did say

54:06.460 --> 54:08.462
he erased all evidence
of their group.

54:08.462 --> 54:10.334
Mm-hmm, well, nearly all.

54:13.902 --> 54:16.601
They had hope.

54:16.601 --> 54:19.125
And they found freedom.

54:19.125 --> 54:21.388
Despite impossible odds.

54:22.389 --> 54:23.825
Maybe that's why Dr. Cho

54:23.825 --> 54:25.958
went back and left
the clue on that ship.

54:25.958 --> 54:28.613
Maybe that's our lesson here.

54:28.613 --> 54:30.702
That like them...

54:32.791 --> 54:35.359
...maybe we can shape
our own futures, too.

54:36.360 --> 54:38.362
[chuckles softly]

54:47.153 --> 54:48.937
[Burnham exhales]

54:57.511 --> 54:59.252
What I said earlier,

54:59.252 --> 55:01.036
about how we used to be happy...

55:01.036 --> 55:02.951
Oh, no, no, no, it's fine.

55:07.173 --> 55:09.567
We were, weren't we?

55:09.567 --> 55:11.003
[comms chime]

55:11.003 --> 55:13.092
<i>STAMETS:
Captain, we are ready</i>

55:13.092 --> 55:15.137
<i>for the vial.</i>

55:16.138 --> 55:17.531
On our way.

55:17.531 --> 55:19.228
So...

55:19.228 --> 55:21.448
what do you think happens
when we finally

55:21.448 --> 55:23.232
put this thing together?

55:23.232 --> 55:25.452
I don't know.

55:27.976 --> 55:30.588
But I can't wait to find out.
