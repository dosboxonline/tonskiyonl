02:01.800 --> 02:05.861
- Walk the wall on the left!
- I need a line!

02:12.644 --> 02:17.581
I found her!
I found her!

02:17.650 --> 02:19.584
I need some help
down here!

02:21.821 --> 02:24.813
I need it now!

02:24.924 --> 02:28.018
Anybody hear me?

02:28.128 --> 02:30.961
Get down here now!

02:31.030 --> 02:32.998
Come on!

02:37.270 --> 02:40.706
Shepherd! Burr!

02:40.807 --> 02:43.435
I got her! I can't move!

02:43.544 --> 02:46.809
Come down here now!

02:48.482 --> 02:51.007
Hold on.
They'll be here.

02:51.051 --> 02:53.645
Move!

02:55.389 --> 02:58.017
- I heard a voice.
- Help me!

02:59.595 --> 03:01.825
I can't breathe!

03:01.930 --> 03:06.731
Help me! Help me out!
Help me out!

03:06.869 --> 03:09.963
Help me move it!

03:38.435 --> 03:41.302
Bring up the skycam.
Pan it left.

03:41.404 --> 03:43.804
Show me what God sees.

03:43.907 --> 03:48.139
Okay, camera two, show me the stands.

03:48.279 --> 03:50.577
- Three, give me the ice.
- Okay, graphic is up.

03:50.648 --> 03:52.616
Uh, put game seven on preset.

03:52.650 --> 03:55.141
How many technicians
are gonna be inside the arena?

03:55.286 --> 03:57.584
We got 12 cameramen,
6 support... that's 18.

03:57.655 --> 03:59.623
I want to limit their access.

03:59.657 --> 04:02.057
Technicians and announcers
are the only ones cleared.

04:02.126 --> 04:04.458
Hey, Spota, let us in.

04:04.595 --> 04:07.996
Work don't stop just 'cause the
Vice President's coming, you know, babe.

04:08.066 --> 04:10.000
Must be Republicans.

04:10.067 --> 04:12.501
Having everybody check in through one
gate like this is a pain in the butt.

04:12.604 --> 04:15.004
- It's only one night.
- It's the last game of the Stanley Cup.

04:15.040 --> 04:17.634
Having the Vice President
here turns a headache into a concussion.

04:17.743 --> 04:21.406
- I didn't vote for this guy.
- That's what makes what you're
doin' such a special gesture.

04:31.824 --> 04:33.758
Hello, Pittsburgh.

04:33.826 --> 04:37.762
Here we are in the seventh game of the
Stanley Cup finals. Penguins and Hawks.

04:37.864 --> 04:41.664
Penguins in a come-from-behind
victory to shut down the Hawks.

04:43.671 --> 04:45.332
Shit.

04:48.442 --> 04:51.206
Sorry. Uh, my dog's missing.

04:51.345 --> 04:53.245
We're out looking for him.

04:53.346 --> 04:56.782
- Is it bad?
- What? You think this might be good?

04:56.884 --> 04:59.045
- Let me see your license.
- Oh, sure.

04:59.153 --> 05:01.451
Move. Move.

05:01.555 --> 05:03.989
We are going to steal your car.

05:04.058 --> 05:06.822
Don't get killed over it, huh?

05:34.757 --> 05:37.487
It's the last game.
We got a couple of minutes to go.

05:37.593 --> 05:39.254
Just 15 seconds to go!

05:39.396 --> 05:42.126
He skates up to center.
He knocks down one defender.

05:42.232 --> 05:45.497
He's skating like a madman around
the ice. He gets to the blue line.

05:45.602 --> 05:48.662
He shoots. Whoa!
And he scores! Whoo!

05:48.773 --> 05:52.402
- Scratch my back with a hacksaw...
- Yes!

05:52.541 --> 05:54.509
Dad!

05:54.611 --> 05:56.169
Hey!

05:58.347 --> 06:00.645
- That's a fancy new stick.
- Michael gave it to me.

06:00.752 --> 06:03.016
- Hi.
- How are you, Darren?

06:03.086 --> 06:05.213
Darren, what are you
doing here?

06:05.323 --> 06:08.383
- You can't stay.
We're getting ready to leave.
- It's his birthday.

06:08.458 --> 06:10.756
And you've got him
all day tomorrow.

06:10.894 --> 06:13.920
I just got these.
I thought the kids might wanna...

06:14.030 --> 06:17.056
We're all going out
to dinner.

06:17.167 --> 06:21.433
- Looks like those are Penguin tickets.
- They are.

06:21.571 --> 06:24.369
It's the seventh game.

06:24.476 --> 06:26.569
- Vice President's gonna be there.
- Daddy! Daddy!

06:28.613 --> 06:31.480
- Hey, that's my hat!
- I can wear it. Mom said I could.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.483
I did?

06:34.953 --> 06:36.887
You know what that means?

06:39.191 --> 06:42.058
- Not a clue.
- It means "I love you."

06:43.195 --> 06:46.130
I love you too.

06:46.198 --> 06:49.463
She's practicing to be deaf,
but that's still my hat!

06:49.602 --> 06:53.800
- I'll get you a new one.
- You can't just take them
without talking to me first.

06:53.941 --> 06:57.035
- Besides, you only have two tickets.
- I'm working at the arena.

06:57.144 --> 07:00.636
- You're back to work, Dad?
- He's a fire inspector at the game.

07:00.747 --> 07:04.148
- It's very important work.
- Are you a fireman again, Daddy?

07:04.217 --> 07:07.618
Kind of, yeah.

07:07.688 --> 07:09.656
Kathi tells me it's only temporary.

07:09.757 --> 07:14.490
- He was trying to save a little
girl in a burning building...
- Are we going to the game?

07:17.065 --> 07:19.033
Don't do this again. I mean it.

07:19.099 --> 07:22.227
It's not fair to the kids... or me.

07:22.335 --> 07:24.269
I promise.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.780
Excuse me.

09:25.466 --> 09:27.798
This is Andrew.
He's the head chef.

09:27.901 --> 09:30.028
Nobody goes in that elevator,
and I mean nobody,

09:30.137 --> 09:32.799
even if they have proper I.D.,
unless this man says it's okay.

09:32.939 --> 09:35.100
If he doesn't know them,
they don't get in that elevator.

09:35.209 --> 09:38.701
After you finish the Vice President's
party, this kitchen is closed.

09:38.814 --> 09:40.941
- Have I made myself clear?
- Abundantly.

09:41.015 --> 09:43.643
That's how I like it.
Abundantly.

10:08.511 --> 10:10.809
Mrs. Ferrara?

10:10.880 --> 10:12.848
Yes?

10:12.949 --> 10:16.476
Let's just stroll into your house
like I'm your favorite nephew.

10:33.604 --> 10:36.869
- Ackerman, Ekers.
- Yeah.

10:36.974 --> 10:40.910
Come on, Mac. Mr. McCord makes sure
the building doesn't burn down.

10:40.979 --> 10:44.915
Go on through, Mr. Mac.
And who's this beauty?

10:44.983 --> 10:47.247
This is my daughter Emily
and my son Tyler.

10:47.352 --> 10:50.879
- Want a stamp?
- Love a stamp.

10:50.990 --> 10:54.255
Hey, can you guys play
after we get in?

10:54.359 --> 10:57.886
Hey, hold your horses.
I'm getting a stamp here.

10:57.997 --> 11:00.397
I'll never wash
this hand again.

11:00.465 --> 11:03.730
- See you later, Mr. Mac.
- Okay.

11:15.582 --> 11:17.846
- Joan.
- Hi, Darren.

11:17.951 --> 11:21.546
- Are you working tonight?
- After I take Tyler to the locker room.

11:21.688 --> 11:24.555
Hey, could you give Emily
a look at Icey?

11:24.591 --> 11:28.550
Icey always loves company. Come on,
Emily, I'm gonna show you where Icey is.

11:28.661 --> 11:32.392
Icey. Big deal.
Some fat guy in a ratty penguin suit.

11:32.532 --> 11:36.298
That blonde you're staring at,
she's the fat guy.

11:40.108 --> 11:42.906
- What's he doing?
- Shaping the blade.

11:42.977 --> 11:46.344
They're like horseshoes. You get 'em
hot enough, you can bend 'em.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.383
You, uh, recognize him?

11:49.450 --> 11:52.419
Yeah. Luc Robitaille.

11:52.520 --> 11:55.250
He waved at me.
You see that, Dad?

11:55.390 --> 11:57.290
Luc Robitaille waved at me.

11:57.391 --> 11:59.757
Come on, I'll introduce you.
He won't bite.

11:59.827 --> 12:04.628
- Luc, this is Tyler McCord
and his father Darren.
- Hi, Tyler. How are you?

12:04.733 --> 12:06.633
- Ca va?
- Bonjour.

12:13.609 --> 12:15.543
Dad, what did he say?

12:15.611 --> 12:17.545
He thinks, uh, they're gonna win.

12:17.613 --> 12:20.548
Hey, that's Brad Tolliver!

12:20.617 --> 12:22.915
- Dad, he doesn't have a rocking chair.
- A what?

12:23.019 --> 12:25.920
My dad said you should be sitting in
a rocking chair instead of on the ice.

12:25.989 --> 12:29.288
- Oh, is that so?
- You play hockey, Tyler?

12:29.425 --> 12:31.859
No, but my dad played.
He was a goalie.

12:31.928 --> 12:35.625
A little semi-pro in Canada.
It was a long time ago.

12:35.766 --> 12:37.666
Come by some afternoon.

12:37.768 --> 12:39.414
I'll show you the difference between
the game you played and the one I play.

12:39.450 --> 12:41.061
I'll show you the difference between
the game you played and the one I play.

12:42.006 --> 12:44.133
I can see the difference.

13:01.293 --> 13:03.386
I got this one, man.

13:04.462 --> 13:06.225
Yes.

13:08.233 --> 13:12.294
You boys have fun?

13:12.338 --> 13:15.671
Luc Robitaille talked to me,
and we saw Brad Tolliver close up.

13:15.774 --> 13:17.969
Your friends are gonna
be so jealous of you.

13:18.043 --> 13:20.477
- I wanna go with Icey.
- So does Tyler.

13:20.513 --> 13:23.482
Icey has to hit the stands, guys.
I'll see you later.

13:23.515 --> 13:25.483
Bye-bye.

13:30.523 --> 13:33.856
Andrew, this is Emily and Tyler.

13:33.894 --> 13:36.055
Pleasure.

13:36.095 --> 13:39.496
- Be right back.
- Come. I want to show you something.

13:44.805 --> 13:47.000
Whoa! Cool!

13:47.040 --> 13:49.770
That's why you won't hear
anyone complain about my cooking.

13:49.877 --> 13:52.539
- At least not to my face.
- You got a burnt-out light bulb.

13:52.614 --> 13:55.811
Could you change it?
I've got my hands full.

13:55.915 --> 13:57.815
Sure.

13:57.919 --> 14:01.548
Is that what Daddy does,
change light bulbs?

14:01.656 --> 14:04.819
No, Emily.
He's just helping out.

14:04.926 --> 14:08.384
- Firemen don't do that kind of stuff.
- What kind of stuff?

14:08.462 --> 14:11.329
- Uh, nothing.
- When are we gonna sit down?

14:37.694 --> 14:41.357
Frequent Flyer is in and on
his way to the locker room.

14:41.431 --> 14:43.365
Keep him moving.

14:51.374 --> 14:54.434
The Penguin fans are anxious
to see for the first time...

14:54.513 --> 14:58.381
- the Penguins kicking the Stanley Cup...
- Do you have any cookies?

14:58.448 --> 15:01.781
You force your way in here with a gun,
and now I have to feed you?

15:01.852 --> 15:05.288
You don't have to.
But I still have the gun.

15:07.625 --> 15:09.889
I think I have some Fig Newtons.

15:15.967 --> 15:18.765
Hey! Caution.

15:18.804 --> 15:20.999
Caution keeps you safe.

15:31.984 --> 15:35.317
I keep my machine gun
in with the produce.

15:35.387 --> 15:38.015
Okay, Veep's comin' in.
Let's get decent!

15:38.057 --> 15:40.150
Christ, Jefferson,
it's a locker room.

15:40.258 --> 15:43.489
Duckerman, why don't you
put on a jock?

15:43.564 --> 15:46.226
- Got any tape?
- You're covering the right head.

15:46.298 --> 15:48.732
Let's go, let's go.

15:48.802 --> 15:53.068
All right, guys, I'm privileged to
introduce Vice President Daniel Bender.

15:53.139 --> 15:56.768
He's a big hockey fan
and he'd like to say a few words.

15:56.844 --> 15:59.836
"A few words."
There's an optimist.

15:59.947 --> 16:02.677
I want to wish you all
the best of luck and, uh,

16:02.751 --> 16:04.946
are you Democrats
or Republicans?

16:05.051 --> 16:07.246
Neither, sir. Canadians.

16:07.322 --> 16:10.450
Well, in that case, good luck...

16:10.526 --> 16:13.461
and I hope to toast
your championship after the game.

16:13.528 --> 16:16.622
Sir, are you going to say the
same thing to the Blackhawks?

16:16.699 --> 16:19.600
Of course.
Nice outfit, Duckerman.

16:30.379 --> 16:33.712
Two nights ago with the Blackhawks
on the brink of elimination...

16:33.816 --> 16:36.546
It's time!

16:36.619 --> 16:39.383
I want you to pick up the phone...

16:39.455 --> 16:44.483
and dial 555-1793.

16:45.761 --> 16:48.753
- That's my husband's work number.
- It certainly is.

16:49.865 --> 16:52.493
When you get him on the line,

16:52.569 --> 16:56.596
- say only what's written on this.
- Ohh.

16:59.910 --> 17:02.936
Kitchen. Yeah. Hold on.

17:03.047 --> 17:04.946
Andrew, it's your wife.

17:14.058 --> 17:16.026
- Hello?
- Andy, it...

17:16.093 --> 17:18.891
We have your wife.
Follow her instructions.

17:24.035 --> 17:26.970
They will not hurt me...

17:27.070 --> 17:28.971
if you do as they say.

17:29.074 --> 17:33.909
If you give any indication something
is wrong, they will... kill me.

17:37.483 --> 17:42.819
When you go to the...
Vice President's box,

17:42.888 --> 17:46.654
you will take two new
assistants with you...

17:46.759 --> 17:48.920
escorted by
two security men.

17:48.995 --> 17:52.658
Get them into the box.
That's all you need to do.

17:52.765 --> 17:55.165
That's all you need to know.

17:55.235 --> 17:57.999
Who are these men?
How will I know them?

17:58.070 --> 18:01.005
In 30 seconds, you'll know.

18:01.074 --> 18:03.599
I swear this.
If you hurt my wife, I'll...

18:03.676 --> 18:07.077
You'll what?
Burn my toast?

18:16.322 --> 18:18.950
- Mr. Ferrara?
- Yes?

18:19.026 --> 18:20.618
Are these men yours?

18:26.835 --> 18:30.601
Yes. They're mine.

18:36.377 --> 18:39.107
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

18:39.214 --> 18:44.379
The National Hockey League presents
game seven of the Stanley Cup finals.

18:44.452 --> 18:49.219
The Chicago Blackhawks
and the Pittsburgh Penguins.

18:51.327 --> 18:54.524
As we get ready for the seventh and
final game of the Stanley Cup finals,

18:54.564 --> 18:58.091
you can feel the electricity in the air;
it sends a chill up your spine, Paul.

18:58.201 --> 19:01.967
One of these clubs is going to
skate with Lord Stanley's cup
here at Civic Arena Ice tonight.

19:04.908 --> 19:07.399
Listen to the crowd, Mike.
They're going crazy.

19:07.510 --> 19:09.876
Well, here's to a great game.

19:09.913 --> 19:14.748
Great if we win;
not so great if we lose.

19:28.066 --> 19:30.000
We are ready.

19:30.068 --> 19:33.231
Thank you, everybody.
You may leave now.

19:33.271 --> 19:35.262
Mr. Ferrara will close up
your stations.

19:45.551 --> 19:48.281
...singing of our National Anthem.

19:48.387 --> 19:54.348
Oh, say, can you see

19:54.426 --> 19:58.760
# By the dawn's
early light

19:58.796 --> 20:03.028
# What so proudly we hailed

20:03.069 --> 20:07.369
# At the twilight's
last gleaming

20:07.440 --> 20:10.068
- # Whose broad stripes
- What the hell are you...

20:10.110 --> 20:12.738
# And bright stars

20:12.812 --> 20:17.442
# Through the perilous fight

20:17.484 --> 20:22.319
# O'er the ramparts
we watched

20:22.422 --> 20:27.325
# Were so gallantly streaming

20:27.394 --> 20:31.797
# And the rockets'
red glare

20:31.899 --> 20:37.201
# The bombs bursting in air

20:37.305 --> 20:42.072
# Gave proof
through the night

20:42.109 --> 20:47.741
# That our flag
was still there

20:47.816 --> 20:50.785
- I love that part.
- # Oh, say does that

20:50.852 --> 20:53.480
- # Star-spangled
- Well, gotta go.

20:53.522 --> 21:00.086
# Banner yet wave

21:00.162 --> 21:04.064
# O'er the land

21:04.132 --> 21:07.158
# Of the free

21:07.235 --> 21:09.863
# And the home

21:09.971 --> 21:14.431
# Of the brave

21:24.554 --> 21:26.488
This place is going crazy right now.

21:26.557 --> 21:30.493
You could not beg, borrow or
steal a ticket before the game tonight.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.653
If you were packing heat,
you couldn't get in here.

21:32.730 --> 21:35.290
Eddie Belfour
starts in goal for Chicago.

21:35.399 --> 21:37.390
Amazingly, Brad Tolliver will play...

21:37.501 --> 21:40.664
even though he could hardly walk today
much less skate with a fever of 104.

21:40.740 --> 21:43.402
And here we go.
Game seven of the Stanley Cup finals.

21:43.508 --> 21:46.136
And the Chicago Blackhawks
control the opening face-off.

21:46.211 --> 21:49.647
They'll work into Pittsburgh territory,
putting pressure on the Penguins early.

21:49.714 --> 21:51.875
Graham, slap shot!
Tolliver makes the save.

21:54.586 --> 21:57.919
Please, he needs a doctor.

21:57.989 --> 22:00.150
No!

22:00.224 --> 22:03.216
Not any more. Go ahead.

22:03.295 --> 22:05.525
Dead heroes get the best funerals.

22:12.237 --> 22:14.603
Thanks for your help, Andrew.

22:16.709 --> 22:21.078
His wife's recently deceased.
He would have been lonely without her.

22:21.180 --> 22:24.315
I hope that clarifies
the urgency of this mission.

22:24.351 --> 22:27.451
Only your best behavior's
gonna be good enough.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.454
That agent's name was Eddie Caline.

22:29.522 --> 22:32.958
He has a 5-year-old boy, a 3-year-old
little girl, and his wife's pregnant.

22:33.059 --> 22:35.459
- I'll send a card.
- What do you want?

22:35.529 --> 22:37.895
What do I want?

22:37.964 --> 22:41.331
World peace, an end to bigotry
and no more mini-malls.

22:43.069 --> 22:45.196
What am I gonna get?

22:45.272 --> 22:48.332
And I am gonna get it.

22:48.443 --> 22:50.877
That, boys and girls,
is really hot.

22:50.945 --> 22:54.108
- What is your objective?
- My objective?

22:54.215 --> 22:58.117
I get funny all over
when you talk like that.

22:58.186 --> 23:00.086
I know what you're thinking.

23:00.122 --> 23:04.991
Evaluate situation, calculate potential
losses and take appropriate action.

23:05.060 --> 23:06.994
Let me do that for you.

23:07.095 --> 23:10.656
The situation is hopeless.
The losses would be unacceptable.

23:10.732 --> 23:14.065
The appropriate action is to do nothing
and keep your fucking mouth shut.

23:14.136 --> 23:17.003
What kind of lunatic are you?

23:17.072 --> 23:20.064
The best kind.

23:20.108 --> 23:23.134
You can keep calling me names
if it makes you feel better.

23:24.380 --> 23:26.405
Throw me your earpiece
and your mike.

23:40.630 --> 23:43.690
Robitaille with a center pass.
That's just gonna miss.

23:43.766 --> 23:47.327
We are still scoreless in game seven,
period one, the Hawks and Pens.

23:52.176 --> 23:54.940
Watch Loeman.
He's got eyes in the back of his head.

23:56.046 --> 23:58.105
They must be closed.

23:59.717 --> 24:01.810
- Oh, gross!
- I have some work to do.

24:01.887 --> 24:04.856
I'll be back before the period ends.
You two stay right here.

24:04.890 --> 24:06.983
I'll go too,
so you'll have company.

24:07.058 --> 24:09.720
Thanks, sweetheart,
but you stay with Tyler.

24:11.730 --> 24:14.198
Now you won't be by yourself.

24:14.267 --> 24:16.201
Thank you.

24:17.935 --> 24:21.928
I mean it. Don't leave your seats.
Oh. In case you want a soda.

24:22.042 --> 24:26.001
- Don't get out of your seats to get it.
- We get the idea, Dad.

24:26.078 --> 24:28.137
Hey, what's that?

24:29.248 --> 24:31.182
Nothing.

24:45.432 --> 24:47.525
What's Daddy gotta do?

24:47.633 --> 24:49.533
Probably change more light bulbs.

24:49.636 --> 24:52.230
You said firemen don't do
that kind of stuff.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.764
Dad's not really
a fireman any more, Emily.

24:56.710 --> 24:59.702
Now a steal by Stevens.
He walks into the Chicago end.

24:59.781 --> 25:02.113
Slap shot!
He... shoots and scores!

25:02.183 --> 25:05.277
Kevin Stevens gives the Penguins
the opening goal.

25:07.086 --> 25:11.113
Get in the fast lane, Grandma.
The bingo game is ready to roll.

25:20.234 --> 25:22.725
Hey!

25:22.805 --> 25:25.205
He doesn't know whether
to cry or wind his watch.

25:25.273 --> 25:27.468
Hey!

25:27.542 --> 25:31.535
- The Penguins have scored.
- Hey!

25:31.647 --> 25:36.675
That one came off Steve Smith, the
Chicago defenseman, and finds the net.

25:36.753 --> 25:40.018
Pittsburgh goal,
his 11th in the play-offs...

25:40.089 --> 25:43.149
scored by number 25,

25:43.225 --> 25:46.023
Kevin Stevens!

25:46.096 --> 25:49.156
Face-off at center ice.
Naslund of the Penguins controls.

25:49.232 --> 25:53.225
He jumps into the Chicago end with the
Penguins leading 1-0 here in game seven.

25:53.304 --> 25:56.569
Mike, as we expected,
the hitting has been ferocious.

25:56.674 --> 25:59.575
Uh, if the smoke bothers anyone,
you just speak up.

25:59.677 --> 26:02.339
There's no reason to kill anyone else.
Nobody's a threat to you.

26:05.884 --> 26:08.819
You know, I voted for you.
I really did.

26:08.885 --> 26:12.286
It's your sincerity
and your compassion.

26:12.356 --> 26:15.519
You happen to be wrong, though. There
may be a reason to kill someone else.

26:15.593 --> 26:18.027
There's bound to be
resistance to my "objective."

26:18.062 --> 26:22.192
I assure you I won't kill
more people than it takes
to convince everyone of my sincerity.

26:22.299 --> 26:24.199
Will you make that cow
stop moaning?

26:24.302 --> 26:26.532
Just...

26:30.375 --> 26:33.139
- What's that?
- An invitation to the White House.

26:33.212 --> 26:35.612
Open it and read it.

26:35.714 --> 26:37.545
Don't, don't, don't.

26:39.651 --> 26:42.381
- Out loud.
- It's nothing but a bunch of numbers.

26:42.455 --> 26:46.016
And they wonder why
this economy's so fucked up.

26:46.092 --> 26:49.755
Those are the numbers of 13 accounts in
5 U.S. banks belonging to 3 countries...

26:49.862 --> 26:54.765
that our government
has frozen for a variety of reasons.

26:54.835 --> 26:58.635
They represent a total deposit of one
billion, seven hundred million dollars.

26:58.738 --> 27:01.104
Christ, it runs in the family.

27:01.140 --> 27:04.507
During the course of this game, all
that money is going to be released...

27:04.578 --> 27:07.411
and transferred to banks
of my choice.

27:07.514 --> 27:10.506
- That's impossible.
- At least one-third must be moved...

27:10.583 --> 27:13.313
during each of the three
periods of the game.

27:13.387 --> 27:17.653
lf, at the first period's end, deposits
are behind, one of you will die.

27:17.758 --> 27:20.420
If we're still lagging at the end of
the second period, two of you will die.

27:20.527 --> 27:24.156
And at the end of the third period
everyone in this building will die.

27:24.232 --> 27:27.065
- You have no idea of the complexity...
- I had an idea.

27:27.102 --> 27:31.436
I had this idea, and we are gonna
make it work or we're gonna die trying.

27:31.506 --> 27:35.806
You will call the President,
and on flash precedence priority,

27:35.877 --> 27:40.075
he will call the Secretary of State
and Secretary of the Treasury.

27:40.116 --> 27:44.678
Then banks will be notified
and the money will begin to move.

27:44.787 --> 27:47.688
Or it won't.

27:47.791 --> 27:50.589
And if it doesn't,
when the game ends,

27:50.626 --> 27:53.288
everyone in this box
and in this arena will die...

27:53.362 --> 27:55.296
by explosion, fire and panic.

27:55.364 --> 27:59.232
Enough bombs have been planted
in this building to stop all
the clocks in the hemisphere.

27:59.301 --> 28:02.464
- You'll die with us.
- Could be.

28:02.571 --> 28:05.563
I don't think anyone with manicured
fingernails and a $10,000 wristwatch...

28:05.642 --> 28:09.476
- is planning on blowing himself up.
- $15,000 wristwatch.

28:12.382 --> 28:14.816
I'm not sure if I like you.

28:14.851 --> 28:18.150
When I make up my mind,
you'll be the first to know.

28:18.222 --> 28:20.713
- You're out of your mind.
- Me? Ha!

28:20.825 --> 28:26.229
I'm not the one paying some
Neanderthal 40 million dollars
to skate up and down the ice.

28:29.768 --> 28:33.431
Call the White House.
You need the number?

28:33.504 --> 28:37.031
Left wing pass
down to Steve Smith.

28:38.476 --> 28:40.671
I've got every agent
converging on the arena,

28:40.779 --> 28:43.247
and we'll all get the support
we need from local P.D.

28:43.315 --> 28:47.342
The FBI won't be necessary.
He's our asset. We'll get him back.

28:47.419 --> 28:50.684
Tell the President I'll keep him fully
informed until the Vice President's out.

28:50.789 --> 28:52.848
There'll be a total
media blackout on this.

28:52.892 --> 28:55.190
We'll inform all news outlets
of how serious this is.

28:55.295 --> 28:58.526
Yes, sir. Absolutely. The place is
sealed off. No one can go in or out.

28:58.630 --> 29:00.530
And...

29:00.633 --> 29:03.067
We messed up a few times
since I've been an agent,

29:03.135 --> 29:05.695
but how the fuck did we lose
the Vice President?

29:23.089 --> 29:25.922
Right side, Weinrich fires.
Down the left side, Graham shoots!

29:29.129 --> 29:32.792
Penguins trying to get it out.

29:32.900 --> 29:35.095
The sound in this building
is absolutely deafening.

29:37.806 --> 29:39.671
Shot picked up by Dubinsky.

29:45.247 --> 29:50.116
Players are playing their guts out. It's
so loud, I can hardly hear myself think.

29:50.151 --> 29:53.814
You don't have to think, Mike.
This is hockey.

29:59.227 --> 30:03.061
The Hawks pressured now. Under 2 minutes
to go. Graham moves against Tolliver.

30:03.132 --> 30:06.863
Fires and scores! The Chicago
Blackhawks have tied this game...

30:06.969 --> 30:09.369
as Dirk Graham nailed it home,
his fourth of the play-offs.

30:09.438 --> 30:13.340
And the Penguins and Hawks
are tied at one in game seven.

30:13.410 --> 30:17.244
The Chicago goal,
his fourth of the play-offs...

30:17.279 --> 30:19.770
They haven't moved a dime.

30:19.850 --> 30:23.047
You know, I don't think
they believe you.

30:23.121 --> 30:26.249
They're gonna sacrifice
a life to test my will.

30:26.290 --> 30:30.249
I'm truly disappointed. Nobody does
anything these days because it's right.

30:30.294 --> 30:32.455
They only do it if you make them.

30:32.563 --> 30:36.363
Would you like to vote on who gets the
distinction of demonstrating my resolve?

30:36.433 --> 30:39.766
You're not giving enough time. I told
you it couldn't be done that quickly.

30:39.804 --> 30:43.262
Oh, you watch how much
they accomplish during the next period.

30:43.308 --> 30:48.075
Now, would you all agree that
the mayor's wife's been most annoying?

30:48.113 --> 30:50.741
Chicago again trying to make a move.

30:52.084 --> 30:54.279
The Hawks attacking
the Penguin territory.

30:54.321 --> 30:56.789
- An Orangeade.
- Coke or Sprite.

30:56.822 --> 31:01.122
Sprite. No, Coke.

31:01.160 --> 31:05.324
- Are you sure this time?
- One minute remaining
in the first period.

31:05.397 --> 31:08.230
- "Sprite. No, Coke. No, Sprite."
- Shut up!

31:09.402 --> 31:11.393
You're lucky Daddy's not here!

31:11.470 --> 31:14.564
- Why, is there a light bulb
that needs changing?
- You take that back!

31:14.640 --> 31:17.507
- Daddy's a fireman!
- He's too scared to be a fireman.

31:17.611 --> 31:20.910
- He is not!
- Is too.
- I hate you.

31:28.189 --> 31:31.283
Hey, Emily!
Dad said to stay here!

31:31.359 --> 31:33.293
Hey, Emily!

31:34.862 --> 31:37.797
Back in the right corner,
it'll be Steve Smith.

31:37.865 --> 31:40.356
Smith out around center.
He lost the puck.

31:40.468 --> 31:43.699
Robitaille back down
to Chicago territory.

31:46.641 --> 31:51.135
Doesn't look too good.

31:51.212 --> 31:55.114
Graham comes down the slot.
He's stopped by Tolliver.

31:55.183 --> 31:57.617
Hey, Joan, going out
to entertain the Veep?

31:57.686 --> 31:59.620
Mmm.

32:00.690 --> 32:03.557
Are you okay?

32:03.658 --> 32:06.388
He can't push it in.
He had a chance.

32:16.806 --> 32:18.899
Ohh!

32:22.678 --> 32:26.637
First period, shots on goal:
Chicago, 12;

32:26.717 --> 32:28.742
Pittsburgh, 8.

32:36.527 --> 32:39.087
Icey!

33:01.619 --> 33:04.213
Say anything
and I'll kill your mother.

33:04.289 --> 33:09.522
The official Stanley Cup album is
on sale at the Arena Concourse area.

33:09.595 --> 33:12.689
Be sure to pick up your copy now.

33:12.764 --> 33:15.460
- Where's Emily?
- She went to the bathroom.

33:15.568 --> 33:17.798
I told you two not to move.

33:17.902 --> 33:20.063
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

33:20.138 --> 33:22.663
- She hit me and...
- You soaked her.

33:24.243 --> 33:26.006
Don't move.

33:26.079 --> 33:29.571
If the building is falling down
around you, you don't move!

33:48.802 --> 33:50.861
Emily!

34:09.724 --> 34:11.885
It's a young wine.

34:11.994 --> 34:14.188
Frisky. Huh.

34:14.228 --> 34:17.561
It's almost impetuous,
wouldn't you say?

34:17.666 --> 34:20.226
I can't think of any
punishment as severe...

34:20.335 --> 34:22.393
as the one you deserve.

34:25.373 --> 34:28.741
They didn't listen to me
and someone died. Call the President.

34:28.844 --> 34:30.744
Tell him how much fun we're having.

34:46.029 --> 34:48.088
I'm sorry. You're not cleared.

34:48.165 --> 34:51.931
The owner just called me.
I'm Icey, the team mascot.

34:52.001 --> 34:54.367
We're here to see
the Vice President.

34:54.438 --> 34:56.371
- Who's this?
- The owner's niece.

34:56.440 --> 34:59.898
Randy, we got clearance
on a Mr. Icey?

35:04.114 --> 35:06.674
Randy?

35:06.750 --> 35:09.913
- Randy.
- Mr. Icey's a woman, jerk-off.

35:28.807 --> 35:31.173
Emily!

35:41.088 --> 35:44.387
Fuck it.

35:44.457 --> 35:47.654
You owe me a Mother's Day card.

35:51.732 --> 35:56.226
- What is this, a day-care center?
- She saw me off a guy.

35:56.336 --> 35:59.237
- Then you off her.
- I tried.

35:59.340 --> 36:03.436
Touch her, you'll lose me as a hostage,
because you'll have to shoot me.

36:03.510 --> 36:06.570
- Mr. Vice President.
- Aw, shut up. He's campaigning.

36:06.647 --> 36:09.741
- Who are you here with?
- My daddy, and he's a boss.

36:09.817 --> 36:12.012
And he's very brave
and he's not afraid.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.748
And he's gonna come looking
for me, and you'll be sorry.

36:14.822 --> 36:18.155
Oh, I'm already sorry.
What do you mean, he's a boss?

36:18.259 --> 36:20.750
He's a head fireman
and he makes sure everybody's safe...

36:20.828 --> 36:22.921
- and there's no fire.
- Who is this boss?

36:22.998 --> 36:26.627
Uh, he must be a fire marshal.
When we have special events...

36:26.701 --> 36:30.535
Yeah, yeah. Go and see if there's a
nervous father looking for his daughter.

36:34.643 --> 36:38.477
- What is your name?
- Emily.

36:38.547 --> 36:41.448
- Emily what?
- McCord.

36:41.518 --> 36:44.385
- And your father's name?
- It's McCord too.

36:44.486 --> 36:48.115
Would you like it if I filled
your little mouth with spiders?

36:48.157 --> 36:50.352
- What's his whole name?
- Darren Francis Thomas McCord.

36:50.392 --> 36:51.637
Thank you.
Let's find out who he is.

36:51.673 --> 36:52.884
Thank you.
Let's find out who he is.

36:54.498 --> 36:56.432
Ah!

37:04.708 --> 37:07.677
Joan, I was trying
to catch up with you and Emily.

37:07.712 --> 37:10.704
- She wasn't supposed to leave her seat.
- I'm Carla.

37:10.781 --> 37:13.113
- Joan had to go home sick.
- But you were with...

37:13.150 --> 37:15.618
my... my daughter Emily.

37:15.686 --> 37:18.052
Yeah, she was lost.

37:18.122 --> 37:20.989
So I took her up
to the owner's box.

37:21.058 --> 37:23.185
Come on.
We'll go get her.

37:41.980 --> 37:43.811
Ow!

38:14.416 --> 38:16.509
Aah!

38:16.583 --> 38:18.312
Aah!

38:19.788 --> 38:22.256
Aah!

40:09.035 --> 40:13.062
Second period action about to begin.
The Penguins and Hawks tied at one.

40:13.139 --> 40:16.472
Penguins have the face-off.
Francis deals it up to the Chicago end.

40:16.576 --> 40:19.204
Jagr will chase it down.
He pops it up.

40:19.279 --> 40:23.079
The pass is out to the Penguins.

40:36.130 --> 40:38.098
You've got to get the cops.

40:38.133 --> 40:41.227
My daughter's missing,
and someone just tried to kill me.

40:41.336 --> 40:43.896
Show me where this happened.

40:43.939 --> 40:47.102
May I help you?

40:47.142 --> 40:51.602
This is Matthew Hallmark, Secret
Service. Put the Vice President on.

40:51.714 --> 40:54.342
Hallmark?

40:54.416 --> 40:58.113
Well, I see they care enough
to send their very best.

40:58.186 --> 41:00.848
Gee, I never heard
that one before.

41:00.922 --> 41:04.323
- Say hello.
- This is Vice President Bender. I...

41:04.392 --> 41:06.952
- Now you talk to me.
- Who are you?

41:07.028 --> 41:08.962
- Is that necessary?
- Yes.

41:09.031 --> 41:11.864
I'm a disillusioned patriot with a yen
to fulfill my personal ambitions.

41:11.934 --> 41:14.767
- All right. How many are dead?
- Counting Secret Service?

41:14.804 --> 41:18.205
By the way, why do you tell everybody
you're Secret Service agents?

41:18.274 --> 41:20.970
If it's supposed to be
a secret, don't tell anyone.

41:21.044 --> 41:23.535
How many are dead?

41:23.647 --> 41:27.913
One civilian, but the room
is full of candidates.

41:27.985 --> 41:31.546
- Don't kill anyone else, you hear me?
- You were told the parameters.

41:31.654 --> 41:34.248
Full transfer of funds
by the end of this game.

41:34.292 --> 41:37.386
No attempt to storm this box;
no attempt to clear the arena.

41:37.461 --> 41:41.124
No helicopters or police vehicles
encroach on the stadium grounds.

41:41.232 --> 41:45.999
- Your demands are unrealistic.
- I'm a positive thinker, Matty.

41:46.104 --> 41:49.301
We know you've already checked on these
accounts, so the wheels are turning.

41:49.407 --> 41:53.275
Oh, by the way, don't make any transfers
to the Bently-owned banks.

41:53.311 --> 41:56.246
As shocking as it may be,
they're CIA fronts.

41:56.315 --> 41:58.681
You were with one of our agencies.

41:58.751 --> 42:01.652
You're wasting some of that
unrealistic timetable.

42:04.790 --> 42:08.021
Did he sound like he'd do it?
Kill the Vice President and everybody?

42:08.093 --> 42:10.960
It sounds like he knows way too much.

42:11.031 --> 42:14.091
Chelios, right side,
wide open to the net.

42:14.133 --> 42:17.261
Tolliver! A great save there from
right in front on Dubinsky.

42:17.336 --> 42:19.327
And back come the Pittsburgh Penguins.

42:19.439 --> 42:21.239
Hawgood's got a man, Robitaille,
but he can't connect on the pass.

42:21.273 --> 42:23.038
Hawgood's got a man, Robitaille,
but he can't connect on the pass.

42:26.311 --> 42:29.769
So, where's this seven-foot penguin?

42:29.850 --> 42:33.581
She was there.
I wanna go up to the owner's box.

42:33.687 --> 42:36.622
There's a VIP in the box,
and you don't have clearance.

42:36.723 --> 42:39.191
- Neither does my daughter.
- Who knows where she is?

42:39.259 --> 42:42.717
Let's page her over the public address.
Maybe she's just lost.

42:42.797 --> 42:45.823
Oh, I made this up?
The penguin had a gun.

42:45.900 --> 42:48.460
We'll page it too.

42:48.536 --> 42:51.266
You said her name
was Carla, didn't you?

42:52.974 --> 42:55.966
I always do things like that.

42:56.044 --> 42:59.639
- You didn't say the name, did you?
- No.

43:13.162 --> 43:15.027
Aah!

43:17.132 --> 43:20.533
- What the fuck is going on?
- Fuck you. And fuck your kid.

43:23.238 --> 43:26.639
- Where is she?
- I-I don't know.

43:26.743 --> 43:31.112
- Is she in the owner's box?
- Maybe. Maybe she went out to dinner.

43:33.417 --> 43:35.408
In a minute, that ear will come off.

43:35.519 --> 43:37.510
All right! All right!

43:37.587 --> 43:39.851
All right! We took the box.

43:39.922 --> 43:42.891
We got people everywhere.

43:42.960 --> 43:44.951
The whole joint's rigged with bombs.

43:45.028 --> 43:48.156
We could bring the whole building down.

43:48.231 --> 43:50.495
What are you, terrorists?

43:50.567 --> 43:53.798
I'm no fucking terrorist.
I'm a professional!

43:53.871 --> 43:56.271
- How do I get in the box?
- Oh, you don't.

43:56.341 --> 43:58.809
Not if you want to see that kid alive.

44:09.455 --> 44:12.049
Aah!

44:25.137 --> 44:28.538
Game's tied at one. Chicago
puts the pressure on the Penguins.

44:28.607 --> 44:31.576
Here's Shantz around the net.
He knocks it right in.

44:31.644 --> 44:34.408
Chicago has taken the lead
against the Penguins.

44:34.481 --> 44:38.440
- Jeff Shantz, the goal scorer.
- This crowd is unhappy,
but give the Hawks credit.

45:12.019 --> 45:16.012
Joe Murphy helping the play,
the Chicago center ice man.

45:27.769 --> 45:29.703
Joan.

45:39.616 --> 45:42.710
Murphy backhanded it off the right wing
boards, and ahead it goes...

45:42.785 --> 45:44.548
into Chicago ice.

45:44.620 --> 45:48.056
Cam Russell wearing number eight
in a bright red Chicago uniform.

45:48.091 --> 45:51.549
For Chicago, every step,
every rush is so important.

45:53.663 --> 45:56.359
911, emergency services.

45:56.400 --> 45:59.301
- Officer Lyons speaking.
- My name is Darren McCord.

45:59.370 --> 46:03.306
I'm calling you
from the Civic Arena. 555-1923.

46:03.373 --> 46:05.307
This is not a crank call.

46:05.377 --> 46:08.676
The Vice President is being held hostage
in the owner's box.

46:08.747 --> 46:11.648
- They've got my daughter too.
- This is Sergeant Kurtz.

46:11.716 --> 46:16.050
- Where are you calling from?
- The executive offices.

46:16.121 --> 46:19.022
Stay there for 90 seconds
and keep the line clear.

46:21.559 --> 46:23.652
The Hawks got a man wide open.

46:23.727 --> 46:26.560
He's a step behind the defense.
Here he comes. His shot.

46:26.598 --> 46:28.566
Diving to make the save.

46:30.703 --> 46:32.830
Yeah?

46:32.939 --> 46:35.066
McCord? Hallmark, Secret Service.
What's your situation?

46:35.141 --> 46:38.770
- Lousy. How long have you
known what's going on here?
- Assume we don't.

46:38.844 --> 46:43.144
Someone is holding the owner's box
and everybody in it, including my kid.

46:43.183 --> 46:46.550
- What else?
- Did you have agents posted
at a private elevator?

46:46.618 --> 46:48.779
- Two.
- Notify their families.

46:48.854 --> 46:52.153
- Had any contact with the aggressors?
- I killed two. Is that contact?

46:52.225 --> 46:55.558
Look, one of them told me they're going
to bring this whole building down.

46:55.628 --> 46:58.688
- What are you gonna do?
- We're evaluating the situation.

46:58.765 --> 47:02.166
There's no situation! They want money,
a lot of it. Give it to them.

47:02.202 --> 47:05.638
If you fuck around
and something happens to my kid...

47:05.706 --> 47:07.970
We're considering
every possible response.

47:08.008 --> 47:10.135
If you're not gonna pay,
I'll get my daughter.

47:10.211 --> 47:12.805
Do not try any kind of rescue.
Do you understand me?

47:12.913 --> 47:15.973
You will jeopardize the Vice President
and everyone else in the arena.

47:16.017 --> 47:18.815
Believe me, we know
what the hell we're doing.

47:18.919 --> 47:21.251
Our agents are entering the arena.

47:21.322 --> 47:24.416
You stay where you are.
We're gonna do this by the numbers.

47:55.358 --> 47:59.818
- What number was that, three?
- What I said goes. Don't do anything.

47:59.864 --> 48:04.164
They've turned this whole place
into one big bomb. Do you understand?

48:04.200 --> 48:07.135
- We have bomb squads.
- They don't do us any good out there.

48:07.171 --> 48:10.629
- I'll find the bombs myself.
- You can't do anything alone!

48:10.708 --> 48:12.642
I'm not alone.

48:22.086 --> 48:24.884
Watching them operate
doesn't give one much hope, does it?

48:24.956 --> 48:28.722
I'm comfortable with whatever strategy
they deem appropriate.

48:28.793 --> 48:33.492
Strategy? Shit.
They fucked up!

48:33.564 --> 48:35.998
Two men should have been
stationed in that kitchen,

48:36.102 --> 48:39.230
one with a clean geometrical line of
fire to every square inch of the room.

48:39.337 --> 48:42.170
Every body and every thing going into
that elevator should have been searched.

48:42.207 --> 48:45.142
And no covered tray should have been
allowed up here without inspection.

48:45.210 --> 48:48.577
How long were you in the service?

48:48.648 --> 48:51.640
I still am.

48:51.717 --> 48:54.652
- This is my vacation.
- Counterfeit section.

48:54.720 --> 48:56.650
Money's good.
You just can't spend it.

48:56.685 --> 48:58.580
Money's good.
You just can't spend it.

49:47.076 --> 49:50.568
We have confirmation.
One thousand meters.

49:50.613 --> 49:52.513
One thousand meters, roger.

49:56.152 --> 49:58.052
Five hundred meters and closing.

49:59.889 --> 50:03.620
Tango Alpha,
going to start deployment.

50:03.659 --> 50:07.493
Sierra Poppa, deploying one.

50:09.966 --> 50:11.831
Deploying two.

50:11.901 --> 50:15.598
Uh, what's your rate
of deployment there?

50:17.474 --> 50:19.669
Roger.

50:19.743 --> 50:21.677
Three hundred feet.

50:21.746 --> 50:25.443
Three hundred feet.
Copy.

50:25.515 --> 50:27.449
Two hundred feet.

50:51.043 --> 50:53.273
Break off!
Break off!

51:02.387 --> 51:04.821
Man down!

51:08.660 --> 51:11.891
This is Hallmark.

51:11.965 --> 51:14.297
I said no vehicles on the grounds,
no helicopters in the air...

51:14.367 --> 51:16.301
and no agents
in the building.

51:16.369 --> 51:20.169
What part of that
did you not understand?

51:32.853 --> 51:36.016
Three cars are closing on the building
that missile came from.

51:36.090 --> 51:39.423
Ground the other choppers.
I don't want to take this guy alive.

51:50.538 --> 51:54.406
Penguins slip it back
behind the Chicago goal.

51:54.442 --> 51:56.603
He shoots and scores!

51:56.711 --> 51:59.680
Sandstrom and the Penguins
have tied it at two.

51:59.747 --> 52:02.614
Oh, scratch my back
with a hacksaw!

52:02.718 --> 52:06.210
Hey!

52:06.289 --> 52:10.191
The Pittsburgh goal,
fourth of the play-offs...

52:10.226 --> 52:15.630
scored by number 17,
Tomas Sandstrom!

52:46.664 --> 52:49.155
The cavalry's coming.

52:49.199 --> 52:53.295
Custer was in the cavalry.
Let 'em come.

52:53.439 --> 52:55.964
- Command, access acquired.
- Roger, copy.

52:56.006 --> 52:58.133
Second team going.
Now.

52:58.176 --> 53:02.169
Motorola MX 360, encryption
and frequency-hopping capability.

53:02.246 --> 53:04.840
Right out of the company store.
You talk, we listen.

53:04.950 --> 53:06.850
Four at the
east side entrance.

53:06.952 --> 53:11.082
We got a light blazer, maybe a tan
windbreaker with a black baseball cap.

53:11.156 --> 53:13.488
A dark yet tasteful windbreaker...

53:13.525 --> 53:17.291
and, uh, a Penguin jacket
and dark pants.

53:17.363 --> 53:20.628
We pay these idiots to protect you,
and they're trying to get you killed.

53:20.699 --> 53:24.430
As a taxpayer, I don't think
you're getting our money's worth.

53:24.504 --> 53:28.440
If those guys want to see a hockey game
so much, we should put them on ice.

53:30.143 --> 53:32.771
We're giving it five minutes.
If they don't report, we're moving in.

53:32.846 --> 53:36.782
That's the President's choice,
but I think it's the wrong one.

53:36.851 --> 53:39.684
- Unless I get a direct order,
I'm getting those guys out.
- Sir?

53:39.720 --> 53:42.712
- What?
- I think you oughta see this.

54:24.934 --> 54:26.868
Stay back!

54:32.609 --> 54:35.544
- Jesus Christ.
- Get 'em out of here.

54:37.046 --> 54:39.378
Penguins gun out of their
own end at the center ice.

54:39.449 --> 54:42.543
They work it down the right.
Murphy has it and he gave it away.

54:42.619 --> 54:46.783
Here's Mullen. It goes wide
off the glove of Eddie Belfour.

54:46.857 --> 54:49.189
John Cullen going
behind the Chicago net.

54:58.268 --> 55:01.032
This guy could prove
to be a pain in the ass.

55:01.104 --> 55:03.038
He has heroic tendencies.

55:27.200 --> 55:30.897
Don't get so worked up.
They'll win.

55:43.315 --> 55:46.011
We've got four minutes left
in period number two.

56:08.442 --> 56:10.637
Centered in the Chicago zone.

56:10.711 --> 56:12.872
Mullen passes to Larry Murphy.

56:12.980 --> 56:15.175
Murphy backhands it
off the right wing boards.

56:15.249 --> 56:17.717
Belfour keeps the play alive.

56:17.819 --> 56:20.879
No, don't!
Oh, don't do it!

56:20.955 --> 56:23.423
This place is ready to explode.

56:31.266 --> 56:32.995
The last seconds of play.

56:35.571 --> 56:37.368
Don't!

56:42.178 --> 56:45.909
- You just killed two
useful members of society.
- No! It's being done!

56:45.982 --> 56:49.975
- The time ticking down here.
- Maybe you'll do better
in the third period.

56:50.053 --> 56:53.887
- They're moving some.
- They're way behind.

56:53.924 --> 56:56.916
I said one-third at the end
of the first period, one-third
at the end of the second period.

56:56.994 --> 56:59.929
- Two seconds left.
- I don't see anything
even close to that.

56:59.997 --> 57:03.160
No!

57:06.670 --> 57:10.834
Second period shots on goal:
Chicago, seven; Pittsburgh...

57:10.908 --> 57:14.002
The mayor has decided not
to run for reelection.

57:14.079 --> 57:17.913
Now, for my
second selection,

57:17.949 --> 57:21.112
I... think...

57:21.185 --> 57:23.415
- Um.
- No, please!

57:23.489 --> 57:25.787
They're moving more.

57:25.890 --> 57:28.051
But it's not that much.

57:29.960 --> 57:33.259
Listen to me, goddam it!
You're getting it!

57:50.149 --> 57:52.208
Kids, don't try this at home.

58:54.616 --> 58:57.107
- Yeah?
- I've got a message for the board.

58:57.152 --> 59:00.588
Maybe you haven't heard.
A guy named Bell invented the telephone.

59:00.623 --> 59:04.115
- Come on, it's been dead all day.
- Which one controls the billboard?

59:04.160 --> 59:06.128
I can't let you do that.

59:06.162 --> 59:08.130
I'm having a real bad day.

59:20.643 --> 59:23.612
You're assuming his detonators
are radio-controlled.

59:23.647 --> 59:26.878
We get someone inside with equipment
to jam all frequencies...

59:30.654 --> 59:32.884
Damn.

59:32.990 --> 59:35.891
- C-4. I hope he's wrong.
- Not likely.

59:35.994 --> 59:38.895
Arson investigator,
lots of commendations.

59:38.996 --> 59:41.897
- Problem is...
- Is what, sir?

59:42.000 --> 59:45.401
He was taken off-line.
He's a head case.

59:50.941 --> 59:53.034
Shit.

01:00:17.104 --> 01:00:20.505
Here we go, final period
of the Stanley Cup finals!

01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:23.174
The Chicago Blackhawks
control the opening face-off.

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:26.202
They'll work it to Pittsburgh territory,
putting pressure on the Penguins early.

01:00:29.615 --> 01:00:32.516
Sir, I have strong reservations
about you going alone.

01:00:32.554 --> 01:00:35.523
There's no way to deploy
any number of men and get close.

01:00:35.557 --> 01:00:39.516
- Nobody else is coming out dead!
- How you gonna get there?

01:00:39.561 --> 01:00:42.530
Walk. One solitary man
shouldn't trigger a deadly response.

01:00:42.564 --> 01:00:46.227
If it does, tell my ex-wife
her gravy train went off the tracks.

01:03:16.091 --> 01:03:20.027
This is the most powerful
plastic explosive in the world.

01:03:20.096 --> 01:03:23.657
- Don't be too quick
to pull the trigger.
- Save it. I placed that stuff.

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:26.395
No detonator, no "ka-boom."

01:03:26.536 --> 01:03:29.198
- Everybody's an expert.
- Bye-bye.

01:03:29.271 --> 01:03:31.671
Aaah!

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:35.877
Bye-bye.

01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:48.525
This is the most powerful
plastic explosive in the world.

01:03:52.096 --> 01:03:55.964
- Do you believe me about the explosives?
- Afraid not.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.430
You're McCord. I'm Hallmark.

01:03:58.503 --> 01:04:00.437
Have any I.D?

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:02.369
I didn't kill you.

01:04:05.543 --> 01:04:08.137
That's for doing your job half-assed...

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:11.147
and putting
my daughter's life in danger.

01:04:11.216 --> 01:04:14.185
- And the Vice President's.
- How'd you happen to come down here?

01:04:14.253 --> 01:04:16.187
I saw these two and followed them.

01:04:16.255 --> 01:04:19.383
Part of my job is recognizing
who's out of place and who isn't.

01:04:19.491 --> 01:04:21.618
They didn't seem
interested in hockey.

01:04:21.694 --> 01:04:25.960
- How'd you kill that guy?
- Magic. I think there's more
setups like this.

01:04:26.099 --> 01:04:29.796
- You know where they are?
- I made some educated guesses.

01:04:29.868 --> 01:04:32.837
These are the points I'd pop
if I wanted to bring this place down.

01:04:32.906 --> 01:04:36.808
- You marked 15 or 20.
- The places that would cause
the most structural damage.

01:04:36.909 --> 01:04:40.310
Third period's started. We got less
than 20 minutes and we're guessing.

01:04:40.414 --> 01:04:42.814
Let's hope I know what I'm doing.

01:04:45.152 --> 01:04:47.814
Oh. Listen.
My son is here too.

01:04:47.888 --> 01:04:51.415
If I can't get back to him,
he's sitting in D-10.

01:04:51.525 --> 01:04:53.322
I'll be there.

01:04:53.394 --> 01:04:56.420
- Thanks.
- Where are the rest of your men?

01:05:00.935 --> 01:05:03.335
From the Chicago end,
McEachern centers.

01:05:03.404 --> 01:05:06.771
Belfour made the stop.
Straka with a quick shot.

01:05:06.875 --> 01:05:09.002
Just missed the far post.

01:05:10.812 --> 01:05:14.145
- Now they're moving it.
- Yeah, but where? Check the codes.

01:05:14.248 --> 01:05:17.149
Four hundred million to
Banco de Vizcaya, Madrid.

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.154
That's one of the counter banks.

01:05:19.222 --> 01:05:23.215
And 300 million
to Banco Popular, Virgin Islands.

01:05:23.325 --> 01:05:27.022
These transfers are being tracked;
you'll never get the money.

01:05:27.162 --> 01:05:30.893
Not all of it. The money
will be transferred to 12 more banks.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.195
I have arrangements with
the presidents of two.

01:05:33.302 --> 01:05:36.533
Once it's transferred, it's transferred
again and again in a matter of minutes.

01:05:36.605 --> 01:05:39.733
With each stop,
cash is siphoned and rerouted,

01:05:39.842 --> 01:05:41.969
some converted to foreign currency,

01:05:42.078 --> 01:05:44.740
some to negotiable instruments.

01:05:44.882 --> 01:05:47.749
Thanks to the incredibly vast
and complicated world of banking...

01:05:47.818 --> 01:05:51.083
that our CIA uses to such advantage,

01:05:51.221 --> 01:05:55.783
about 500 million dollars will be lost,
absorbed by the system.

01:05:55.893 --> 01:05:59.761
And the other billion,
200 million is just a diversion.

01:05:59.829 --> 01:06:02.593
I only wanted enough to
pay off my American Express.

01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:05.101
You wouldn't be so generous
with that information...

01:06:05.202 --> 01:06:08.137
if you weren't planning
to kill everyone here.

01:06:09.742 --> 01:06:13.872
Who gets the Cup if I blow up
the building before the game is over?

01:06:17.982 --> 01:06:19.882
Yeah?

01:06:21.753 --> 01:06:24.654
Not on the phone. You know
they've got the frequency by now.

01:06:31.664 --> 01:06:33.564
Don't go away.

01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:39.227
Taken away, and McEachern
hustling down the right side.

01:06:39.338 --> 01:06:43.536
Coming into the Chicago end. Moves in to
the net. A backhand shot, off-target.

01:07:01.361 --> 01:07:04.194
McCord's disarming your bombs.

01:07:04.265 --> 01:07:07.200
- Is he guessing?
- He's a pretty good guesser.

01:07:07.267 --> 01:07:09.201
- Is he alone?
- Yeah.

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:13.206
- Why didn't you kill him?
- Two of your goons started
firing at us. He ran off.

01:07:13.274 --> 01:07:17.904
- It was all I could do to keep
from getting my own ass shot.
- I want him.

01:07:18.012 --> 01:07:20.913
I would've had him if you had
more control over your men.

01:07:21.015 --> 01:07:24.815
The only problem my men had is they
didn't hit what they were shooting at.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.821
Look, I was there too.

01:07:29.157 --> 01:07:30.988
Nice.

01:07:32.827 --> 01:07:35.728
I got the next best thing
to the fireman.

01:07:35.832 --> 01:07:39.768
He's got a little boy here in the arena.
I know where he's sitting.

01:07:39.868 --> 01:07:42.063
Bring him to me.

01:07:43.305 --> 01:07:45.569
I always wanted a son.

01:07:49.478 --> 01:07:52.003
Greg Smyth against Robitaille,
and zoom!

01:07:52.115 --> 01:07:56.916
Quick shot, save made! Hawgood trying
to tee it up. Stopped by Tolliver.

01:08:00.357 --> 01:08:03.019
- Tyler?
- Yeah?

01:08:03.126 --> 01:08:05.356
Pretty exciting game, huh?

01:08:05.428 --> 01:08:10.422
- How come you know my name?
- Your dad and I are friends.
He asked me to come get you.

01:08:10.501 --> 01:08:15.302
He and your sister got invited to sit
in the owner's box, way up there.

01:08:15.372 --> 01:08:18.307
They got big soft chairs
and plenty to eat.

01:08:18.376 --> 01:08:22.312
My dad told me to stay here,
even if the building fell down.

01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:25.314
If it did come down,
up there is where you'd wanna be.

01:08:25.384 --> 01:08:27.613
Come on.

01:08:27.719 --> 01:08:29.710
I'm gonna stay here.

01:08:29.821 --> 01:08:32.984
I'm gonna be embarrassed
going back without you.

01:08:35.093 --> 01:08:39.792
- Do you know my mom?
- No, but your dad's invited me
over for dinner tomorrow.

01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:42.822
My mom and dad don't live together.

01:08:42.934 --> 01:08:45.835
He didn't mention that.
He just said bring you upstairs.

01:08:45.937 --> 01:08:49.270
- Don't you think you should
do what you're told?
- I am.

01:08:51.844 --> 01:08:55.279
I need you to come with me.
I'm with the Secret Service.

01:08:55.348 --> 01:08:58.180
- Come with me now.
- Come on! Down in front!

01:09:00.487 --> 01:09:03.421
- I'll scream.
- I said, I'm with the Secret Service.

01:09:03.490 --> 01:09:07.756
- And I'm a little kid.
- Hey, fella, I didn't pay to watch you!

01:09:07.861 --> 01:09:09.761
Down in front!

01:09:18.304 --> 01:09:21.398
Steve Smith finds the lane.
He'll skate ahead.

01:09:21.508 --> 01:09:23.203
Coming to the Penguin line.

01:09:59.416 --> 01:10:01.543
How many'd you get?

01:10:01.618 --> 01:10:04.746
Four, so far.

01:10:04.821 --> 01:10:07.756
- Is that all?
- Christ, I'm just one guy.

01:10:07.825 --> 01:10:10.726
- How many did you get?
- Just one.

01:10:12.129 --> 01:10:15.895
You are all alone, aren't you?

01:10:21.439 --> 01:10:25.170
- You must be real proud.
- I'm gonna be real rich.

01:10:25.208 --> 01:10:27.676
Now, very slowly...
I mean very slowly...

01:10:27.745 --> 01:10:31.738
pull your hands
out of your pockets.

01:10:37.155 --> 01:10:41.216
- What are you gonna do, drown me?
- No.

01:11:13.059 --> 01:11:14.959
Aaaah!

01:12:10.452 --> 01:12:12.886
- Yeah?
- Hallmark's dead.

01:12:12.989 --> 01:12:15.958
- Who's this?
- Tom Castillo, Secret Service.

01:12:16.059 --> 01:12:20.018
Tom Castillo.
How you doin', Tom?

01:12:20.096 --> 01:12:22.621
- I hope you were gentle with Hallmark.
- How many hostages,

01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:25.134
besides the Vice President,
are still alive?

01:12:25.235 --> 01:12:28.636
That's a personal question.
Ever been involved in an A.O.P., Tom?

01:12:28.706 --> 01:12:32.073
I didn't call for conversation.
How many are still alive?

01:12:32.175 --> 01:12:36.077
You'd probably think I was lying,
no matter what I told you,

01:12:36.179 --> 01:12:40.081
so I'm gonna let you talk
to a little friend of mine.

01:12:42.152 --> 01:12:44.518
Hello?

01:12:44.622 --> 01:12:47.716
- Hello?
- Emily.

01:12:47.792 --> 01:12:51.353
Don't let him know it's me. I'll get
you out. I'll take you home, I promise.

01:12:51.429 --> 01:12:55.365
Look around and tell me
how many people are there.

01:12:58.403 --> 01:13:00.667
Twelve.

01:13:00.739 --> 01:13:03.674
Well, now, wasn't that sweet?

01:13:03.741 --> 01:13:06.301
She included me, Tom.

01:13:06.411 --> 01:13:09.903
Tell me what an A.O.P. is, or I'm gonna
shoot this cute little pumpkin.

01:13:10.015 --> 01:13:12.176
Listen to me. Listen good.

01:13:12.218 --> 01:13:15.381
If you touch her,
you look at her cross-eyed, you lose.

01:13:15.421 --> 01:13:17.912
How do you figure that, fireman?

01:13:18.024 --> 01:13:21.960
Okay, here's the game
and here are the rules.

01:13:22.061 --> 01:13:25.258
You've got your hostages and your bombs,
so you can get your money.

01:13:25.331 --> 01:13:29.267
I'm gonna try to stop you,
but I don't want anyone to get hurt.

01:13:29.336 --> 01:13:31.298
You stop me, you win.
I get your bombs, I win.

01:13:31.333 --> 01:13:33.261
You stop me, you win.
I get your bombs, I win.

01:13:33.407 --> 01:13:34.499
That's the game,
you piece of shit.

01:13:34.574 --> 01:13:38.408
If you touch her, the game's off.
Then I'll come after you.

01:13:38.445 --> 01:13:42.814
You'll have to kill me in front of every
body in this arena. There will be panic.

01:13:42.883 --> 01:13:46.614
The Secret Service, S.W.A.T., the
fucking navy will have to come in here.

01:13:46.719 --> 01:13:49.586
Then you don't get your money.
You lose, pal.

01:13:49.623 --> 01:13:52.592
Well, that's not bad
for a civil servant.

01:13:52.626 --> 01:13:55.595
Oh, by the way,
in the Secret Service,

01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:57.359
A.O.P. is "assault on principle."

01:13:57.431 --> 01:14:00.264
- In this case, our Vice President.
- I don't give a shit.

01:14:00.301 --> 01:14:05.238
Ooh, now, Tom, come on. If we're
gonna play, you got to play nice.

01:14:05.306 --> 01:14:10.266
You run your ass off. I know where the
bombs are, so I know where you're going.

01:14:10.378 --> 01:14:13.438
Then come and get me.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:19.247
Would you like
a glass of wine or a cigarette?

01:14:19.288 --> 01:14:23.156
It's customary to offer these
minor vices to someone before they die.

01:14:33.169 --> 01:14:36.138
- I'm not afraid of you.
- Sure you are.

01:14:36.205 --> 01:14:39.834
- I'm the scariest person you've seen.
- You're the meanest.

01:14:39.877 --> 01:14:42.846
Am I, now?
How do you suppose I got that way?

01:14:42.879 --> 01:14:47.816
Maybe when you were born
you had something wrong with your brain.

01:14:49.887 --> 01:14:52.685
Don't you know any little boys like me?

01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:55.850
If there were any at my school,
they'd get expelled.

01:14:55.893 --> 01:14:58.225
I can assure you there are one or two.

01:14:58.262 --> 01:15:03.029
I'm gonna kill your daddy.
What do you think about that?

01:15:03.067 --> 01:15:06.969
He promised he'd take me home.
He always does what he says.

01:15:07.039 --> 01:15:08.666
So do I.

01:15:17.616 --> 01:15:20.710
We're in the third period.
The Penguins on the rush.

01:15:20.819 --> 01:15:23.049
Tamer brings it in.

01:15:23.122 --> 01:15:26.683
He puts it in!
Ron Francis!

01:15:26.793 --> 01:15:31.526
Oh, buy Sam a drink
and get his dog one too!

01:15:55.255 --> 01:15:58.088
Chicago desperate to get
back into this game.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:02.563
Sutter fires and scores!
Chicago does get the third goal!

01:16:02.663 --> 01:16:06.565
I tell ya, Mike, I don't think
Tolliver looks like himself right now.

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.967
We shouldn't be surprised. He had
a 104 degree temperature earlier today.

01:16:10.038 --> 01:16:13.439
He looks like he's struggling
in that goal for the Penguin.

01:16:13.508 --> 01:16:16.966
- Yo, Ref.
- He's calling for the referee.

01:16:17.045 --> 01:16:20.446
- He might wanna go to the bench.
- Tolliver is gonna head that way.

01:16:20.515 --> 01:16:23.450
- Backup for the Penguins is Ken Wregget.
- What's the matter?

01:16:23.518 --> 01:16:27.454
I really feel like shit.
I don't think I can goal.

01:16:27.523 --> 01:16:30.185
Go to the locker room. Wregget!

01:16:30.259 --> 01:16:32.659
- Get in there.
- Let's go, Kenny.

01:16:36.199 --> 01:16:40.431
Now in goal for Pittsburgh,
number 31, Ken Wregget.

01:16:52.082 --> 01:16:54.016
Hey, fireman, where are you?

01:16:54.083 --> 01:16:57.143
- You don't call, you don't write.
- I'm not far away.

01:16:57.220 --> 01:16:59.780
- How many have you found?
- How many what?

01:16:59.823 --> 01:17:02.792
I could detonate all ten right now.

01:17:02.827 --> 01:17:05.819
Go ahead. Then you lose.

01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:12.267
Nervous stomach, fireman?

01:17:15.006 --> 01:17:17.474
He's at number seven.
Get somebody there.

01:17:23.248 --> 01:17:25.648
Charge!

01:17:25.684 --> 01:17:31.020
Roberts cannot get it out.
Chelios in deep. A shot off the stick!

01:17:37.595 --> 01:17:39.426
Section B. Now.

01:18:59.349 --> 01:19:01.613
Chelios guns it ahead
to Bernie Nicholls.

01:19:01.683 --> 01:19:04.251
Here he comes!
Look out!

01:19:04.286 --> 01:19:08.916
He shoots and scores! Bernie Nicholls
carried it in, right down the slot.

01:19:09.025 --> 01:19:10.583
A heavy slap shot.

01:19:18.635 --> 01:19:23.299
An old-fashioned shoot-out here
at the Stanley Cup competition.

01:19:41.192 --> 01:19:43.626
Up the alley now,
center circle.

01:19:43.662 --> 01:19:46.153
Lines it up to the Penguins.

01:19:46.197 --> 01:19:50.725
He'll get the puck out.
He really shakes his stick.

01:19:50.803 --> 01:19:54.739
Mike, they're making some noise
down here and I'm not sure why.

01:19:54.807 --> 01:19:59.210
I don't believe this. Brad Tolliver
is actually coming back into the game!

01:19:59.278 --> 01:20:02.714
This is a guy that once
finished a game with a broken ankle.

01:20:08.521 --> 01:20:12.457
Takes a lot of guts to come back in
at this point with Chicago leading, 4-3.

01:20:12.526 --> 01:20:16.326
They're on the verge of winning
their first Stanley Cup since 1960.

01:20:16.395 --> 01:20:18.829
Now he's just sitting on the bench.

01:20:20.133 --> 01:20:22.658
Feeling better?

01:20:22.702 --> 01:20:25.193
Then get the fuck in there.

01:20:27.675 --> 01:20:30.610
And here he comes.

01:20:34.415 --> 01:20:37.350
Now back in goal for Pittsburgh,

01:20:37.418 --> 01:20:42.355
number 35, Brad Tolliver,
replacing number 31, Ken Wregget.

01:20:42.423 --> 01:20:47.122
I don't know what he did, if he
just recharged his battery or what,

01:20:47.228 --> 01:20:51.688
but this guy was really sick
and he's gonna try to finish the game.

01:20:51.766 --> 01:20:56.362
Can he can make the big saves to keep
the Penguins within striking distance?

01:20:56.405 --> 01:20:59.374
He's got all summer to get better.

01:20:59.409 --> 01:21:03.175
There's Tolliver, with the crowd
here literally crazy on their feet.

01:21:03.246 --> 01:21:07.182
Penguins looking for a lift here
to try and get back in this game.

01:21:07.249 --> 01:21:10.377
Here we go!
Chicago will control the face-off.

01:21:10.453 --> 01:21:14.287
- They'll dump it to the Penguin end.
- Stay down there.

01:21:14.325 --> 01:21:18.989
- Oh, Christ.
- Chicago drives it back
into Pittsburgh territory.

01:21:19.062 --> 01:21:22.759
Chicago slips it back
behind the Pittsburgh goal.

01:21:22.833 --> 01:21:26.929
The Penguins try to get the puck back,
and they do just that.

01:21:27.003 --> 01:21:30.461
They scramble now
and deliver up the right side.

01:21:30.574 --> 01:21:34.533
They have to stay on offense. Tolliver
is not challenging the shooters.

01:21:34.645 --> 01:21:37.671
- He hasn't challenged much all night.
- Oh, shit.

01:21:41.519 --> 01:21:43.749
Move out!

01:21:44.989 --> 01:21:46.786
Move out!

01:21:46.858 --> 01:21:49.418
Goddam it, move out!

01:21:49.460 --> 01:21:51.758
He's gonna come out.
He'll challenge.

01:21:51.795 --> 01:21:56.698
Tolliver hits his head on the ice,
and he's hurt, but play continues.

01:21:56.767 --> 01:21:59.634
The puck gets free.
The Penguins have command.

01:22:01.973 --> 01:22:04.305
The Penguins trail by only one.

01:22:06.145 --> 01:22:10.639
Tolliver hit his head on the ice
so hard his kids will be born dizzy.

01:22:18.157 --> 01:22:21.558
This is Chicago on the attack.

01:22:50.391 --> 01:22:55.658
What a save by Brad Tolliver!
That's the save of the year!

01:22:55.697 --> 01:22:58.757
He oughta get five to ten
for robbing the Hawks on that...

01:22:58.832 --> 01:23:01.266
to keep the Penguins within a goal.

01:23:01.336 --> 01:23:03.566
Not to mention, Paul,
that he's been sick.

01:23:03.672 --> 01:23:08.575
He didn't challenge much this game. Now
he comes up with the save of the year.

01:23:08.677 --> 01:23:13.114
No question about it,
that is his biggest save ever.

01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:40.699
- He makes a move in front of the net.
- What's he doing?

01:23:42.912 --> 01:23:47.250
- He just slammed Dubinsky!
- Tolliver, what the fuck are you doing?

01:23:47.286 --> 01:23:50.345
He gave him a right cross
and knocked him down.

01:23:50.421 --> 01:23:54.084
He's gonna get
a game misconduct and a fine.

01:23:54.125 --> 01:23:57.094
He's put his team shorthanded.
The Penguins now are really in the hole.

01:23:57.195 --> 01:24:00.460
Strange night for Tolliver.
I don't know what he's up to.

01:24:00.530 --> 01:24:06.435
Tolliver, that's
a thousand-dollar fine!

01:24:19.350 --> 01:24:21.944
Get outta the way!

01:24:28.061 --> 01:24:29.824
Who the hell are you?

01:24:32.231 --> 01:24:33.892
What the hell...

01:24:35.869 --> 01:24:38.303
Aaah!

01:24:45.478 --> 01:24:48.811
Ysebaert will rebound.
He'll turn and shoot.

01:24:48.882 --> 01:24:54.286
Less than three minutes to go. He'll
have to find the puck. And he does.

01:24:54.422 --> 01:24:58.222
Face-off.
Off the puck he goes!

01:24:58.292 --> 01:25:03.252
Chicago has it back again with two
minutes to go in third-period action.

01:25:03.298 --> 01:25:07.530
On the move. The Blackhawks
stopped by the Penguins' line.

01:25:15.778 --> 01:25:19.839
The Penguins desperately
trying to get back and tie.

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:23.509
The Chicago Blackhawks
hold on to a 4-3 lead.

01:25:23.551 --> 01:25:27.487
Penguins have to look for a big gun
to try and topple Chicago again.

01:25:27.555 --> 01:25:30.021
Just moments away, they're gonna pack up
the Stanley Cup and take it to Chicago.

01:25:30.057 --> 01:25:32.488
Just moments away, they're gonna pack up
the Stanley Cup and take it to Chicago.

01:25:43.173 --> 01:25:46.199
Intercepted by Chicago!

01:25:46.275 --> 01:25:49.608
Big check on
John Cullen of the Penguins.

01:25:56.787 --> 01:26:02.020
Jagr going for the net, Naslund shoots,
and he's stopped by Belfour.

01:26:08.366 --> 01:26:11.335
A minute, thirty-five to go
in the third period.

01:26:11.369 --> 01:26:14.634
That's all that remains
for Chicago to win the Stanley Cup.

01:26:14.705 --> 01:26:17.697
The Penguins need a rally
to tie the game.

01:26:17.775 --> 01:26:20.209
Penguins reach in the corner.

01:26:21.747 --> 01:26:24.807
Drop it.

01:26:40.934 --> 01:26:43.903
Oh, what a save!

01:26:43.969 --> 01:26:48.372
Larmer drills one! Nice stop! He gave
more moves than Mae West on that one!

01:26:48.474 --> 01:26:52.274
One minute remaining
in the third period.

01:26:52.312 --> 01:26:56.078
And the Penguins
trailing by a goal.

01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:58.743
Chicago still
putting pressure on.

01:27:00.387 --> 01:27:04.380
Forty seconds remaining now.

01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.921
Aaah!

01:27:09.263 --> 01:27:12.027
The Penguins
need a goal desperately.

01:27:12.100 --> 01:27:15.866
Thirty seconds left. Chicago's looking
for the parade down Michigan Ave.

01:27:15.936 --> 01:27:18.131
They feel they've got
the Stanley Cup.

01:27:23.178 --> 01:27:25.612
Aaah!

01:27:34.689 --> 01:27:36.657
Aaah!

01:27:36.726 --> 01:27:38.660
...Chicago win the Stanley Cup.

01:27:38.728 --> 01:27:41.788
Time again ticking down.
Penguins running out of it.

01:27:43.133 --> 01:27:47.627
Penguins reaching for every
possible thing they have.

01:27:47.703 --> 01:27:51.639
Chicago takes it away. They'll drive
it to center with 14 seconds to go.

01:27:51.673 --> 01:27:54.141
The Penguins don't have much time!

01:27:54.177 --> 01:27:57.271
The puck's run by Francis,
ahead to Robitaille.

01:27:57.347 --> 01:28:00.077
Not much time to go. Luc Robitaille...

01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:10.151
We've got eight seconds left!

01:28:14.731 --> 01:28:16.699
Seconds to go.

01:28:35.053 --> 01:28:37.021
Stop the press!
Stop the press!

01:28:37.088 --> 01:28:39.022
The Penguins have tied the game.

01:28:39.091 --> 01:28:43.528
We're going to sudden death overtime!
You would have to be here to believe it!

01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:48.692
Lucky Luc has scored for the Penguins
with under a second to go!

01:28:53.539 --> 01:28:57.441
This series has been incredible!

01:28:57.510 --> 01:29:00.343
- Lucky Luc has done it again!
- Sudden death?

01:29:00.379 --> 01:29:02.745
Sudden death.

01:29:02.815 --> 01:29:06.615
Paul, the Penguins
would not give up, despite the odds.

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.214
Belfour tried everything
in his power to stop them.

01:29:11.257 --> 01:29:15.216
The Penguins have forced
sudden death overtime.

01:29:15.262 --> 01:29:19.756
The team that scores first in the
next period will win the Stanley Cup!

01:29:19.833 --> 01:29:22.267
Pittsburgh goal,

01:29:22.371 --> 01:29:25.534
his 14th in the play-offs,
scored by...

01:29:25.640 --> 01:29:28.541
Life's just a shitbox
of ironies, huh?

01:29:28.644 --> 01:29:31.772
We still got money to move.
I hope it's not mine.

01:29:31.846 --> 01:29:33.780
Everybody's got
a little more time.

01:29:33.848 --> 01:29:36.783
I'd hate to see them waste it.

01:29:36.851 --> 01:29:38.785
Wouldn't you?

01:31:17.857 --> 01:31:21.315
Throw away the clocks, because the next
goal is going to win the Stanley Cup.

01:31:21.394 --> 01:31:23.328
That's what sudden death
is all about.

01:31:23.396 --> 01:31:27.332
Penguins control the draw,
drop it into the Chicago end.

01:31:27.400 --> 01:31:29.334
Jagr will carry it in.

01:32:47.618 --> 01:32:52.419
Both net-minders coming up tough here.
McEachern has it again!

01:32:52.489 --> 01:32:54.423
Psst.

01:33:07.771 --> 01:33:09.796
Aah!

01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:13.606
Aaaah!

01:33:15.014 --> 01:33:18.541
Breaking quickly!
Got a man! Move!

01:33:18.618 --> 01:33:22.076
Bang! I'm immortal.

01:34:11.573 --> 01:34:13.336
Aah!

01:35:19.044 --> 01:35:22.275
Aaaah!

01:35:42.202 --> 01:35:44.864
Jagr will carry it in,
but he's checked.

01:35:57.618 --> 01:36:01.076
Aaaah!

01:36:02.791 --> 01:36:05.089
Holy shit!

01:36:13.102 --> 01:36:14.899
What's that?

01:37:58.679 --> 01:38:01.580
Daddy!

01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:06.010
Daddy.

01:38:29.010 --> 01:38:31.843
- Come on, let's go!
- Watch it, will ya?

01:38:56.339 --> 01:38:58.807
How many did you find, fireman?

01:39:59.705 --> 01:40:01.639
Tyler.

01:40:04.476 --> 01:40:07.411
I didn't move, Dad.
I didn't move.

01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:09.573
Not even when things
blew up.

01:40:09.649 --> 01:40:11.844
I didn't move.

01:40:18.091 --> 01:40:20.355
It's over.

01:40:24.931 --> 01:40:28.697
You're McCord, right?
I'm Agent Saccio.

01:40:28.770 --> 01:40:31.705
Better off not moving
until this settles down.

01:40:31.772 --> 01:40:35.708
The Vice President wants very much
to meet you. He's very grateful.

01:40:38.446 --> 01:40:40.380
Daddy. Daddy.

01:40:40.448 --> 01:40:42.541
Daddy, that's the man.

01:40:43.852 --> 01:40:46.116
That's the man, Daddy.
That's him.

01:40:52.961 --> 01:40:54.895
Daddy!

01:41:00.901 --> 01:41:02.801
Stay with him.

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:05.905
Emily!

01:41:10.146 --> 01:41:12.080
Daddy!

01:41:26.163 --> 01:41:27.528
Let's go.

01:41:39.676 --> 01:41:42.338
Daddy!

01:41:48.219 --> 01:41:50.187
Daddy!

01:42:03.301 --> 01:42:05.735
No!

01:42:05.804 --> 01:42:07.738
Aaah! Daddy!

01:42:09.208 --> 01:42:11.574
Daddy!

01:42:46.781 --> 01:42:50.740
I'm not gonna kill you!

01:42:50.785 --> 01:42:54.744
I'd rather you spent the rest
of your life remembering you
couldn't save your little girl.

01:42:59.627 --> 01:43:01.288
Daddy!

01:43:34.564 --> 01:43:36.555
Aah!

01:43:52.082 --> 01:43:53.811
Aaah!

01:43:56.521 --> 01:43:58.682
Aah!

01:44:12.405 --> 01:44:13.997
Aaah!

01:44:20.546 --> 01:44:23.174
Aaah!

01:44:37.264 --> 01:44:39.858
Aaaah!

01:45:39.796 --> 01:45:42.390
You should've seen my dad.

01:45:43.500 --> 01:45:46.560
My daddy's a fireman.
