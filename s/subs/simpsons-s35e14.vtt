I don't care what Bart says,

taking your cat for a walk.

00:40.766 --> 00:42.708
Oh, that's lovely.

00:42.859 --> 00:44.117
Now get out!

00:44.211 --> 00:47.713
Your mangy cat can't be
in here if she's un-vested.

00:47.864 --> 00:51.124
Oh, but my kitty
is so empathetic.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.795

Support me, Apples.

01:08.718 --> 01:10.194
Oh, boy.

Well, it was peck-and-go
for a minute there,

01:13.982 --> 01:16.149
but Gwyneth Poultry
is gonna be all right.

01:16.302 --> 01:18.151
Here's your astronomical bill.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.137
Oh, they'll be covering it.

01:20.155 --> 01:23.140
$16,000?! For a chicken?

01:23.309 --> 01:26.418
I just ate a whole bucket
of them for 20 bucks.

01:26.570 --> 01:29.646

01:40.492 --> 01:43.176
They say all it takes
to financially ruin a family

01:43.329 --> 01:45.771
is one unexpected medical bill.

01:45.922 --> 01:47.272
Who knew ours would be
for jacking up

01:47.441 --> 01:49.441

01:49.668 --> 01:53.612
I am so sorry. You can sell
my Malibu Stacy Dream House.

01:53.763 --> 01:57.116
It's increased in value.
I just redid the kitchen.

01:57.343 --> 01:59.843
Relax. We're not gonna
sell your toys.

01:59.862 --> 02:01.620

the real money is.

02:01.771 --> 02:02.846

What? My upper-lower,

02:04.625 --> 02:07.442

isn't gonna get us out of this.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.111
Hmm. In order to save
this family,

02:10.131 --> 02:12.873
I'm gonna have to do something
I've never done before,

02:12.967 --> 02:14.466
get a job.

02:14.693 --> 02:16.360
Oh, you've had tons of jobs:

02:16.378 --> 02:19.696
cop, realtor, gym owner,
erotic baker,

02:19.789 --> 02:21.122
weed sommelier.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.866
Those were for my own growth.

02:22.959 --> 02:25.702
This time, it's not personal.

02:25.795 --> 02:27.962
Ooh, this one sounds perfect.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.206
They're hiring cooks.

02:29.299 --> 02:31.892
Ooh, cooking.
That's one of the only things

02:31.986 --> 02:33.543
I don't doubt myself at.

02:33.637 --> 02:36.471
"Exciting work,

02:38.993 --> 02:40.475
What's GimmeChow?

02:40.494 --> 02:42.052
It's a new food delivery app.

02:42.070 --> 02:43.570
The teachers have been using it
ever since

02:43.664 --> 02:46.907
Lunch Lady Dora was on
<i> Cafeteria Nightmares.</i>

02:47.075 --> 02:50.669
[groans] They're only hiring
for evening shifts.

02:50.896 --> 02:54.247
Evenings? That's when you
and the food make dinner happen.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.082
I don't know how
to make pork chops.

02:56.235 --> 02:58.735
Where do you kill the pigs?
In the sink?

02:58.904 --> 03:01.329
Come on, guys.
We can help Mom out

03:01.348 --> 03:03.089
and cook dinner as a family.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.683
Aw, geez, you know,
I probably would not...

03:04.910 --> 03:06.000
Yeah, I'd love to, but that's...

03:06.020 --> 03:08.645
Homie, we need this.

03:10.191 --> 03:14.676
Honey, of course
we're all happy to help.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.029
Look, I'm already cooking.

03:17.180 --> 03:19.740
This is how nachos are born.

03:23.429 --> 03:26.538
Mr. Largo? But you
already have a job.

03:26.690 --> 03:29.357
I teach music
in a public school, Marge.

03:29.451 --> 03:32.044
Do the math. I sure didn't.

I like to...

04:09.641 --> 04:10.916
Oh, we got a question.

04:11.143 --> 04:14.478
Wait, so one kitchen is
pretending to be 20 restaurants

04:14.571 --> 04:16.922
when it's actually
zero restaurants?

04:17.073 --> 04:19.483
It sounds like
you're catfishing the public.

04:19.501 --> 04:22.076
Think of it as
catfish po'boy-ing them,

04:22.096 --> 04:25.338
which is a special
at Mama Juju's Bayou Bistro.

04:25.491 --> 04:27.340
How much does this job pay?

04:27.493 --> 04:29.935
-Minimum wage.
-[overlapping grumbling]

04:30.086 --> 04:33.346

Sweet, juicy overtime.

04:33.499 --> 04:35.849
That'll replace
the newspaper in your wallet.

04:36.001 --> 04:37.851
And believe me,
this job's gonna be

04:38.003 --> 04:39.987

04:45.268 --> 04:48.936
Chef? [chuckles] Wow.
No one's ever called me--

04:49.031 --> 04:50.530
Make that 11 grilled cheeses.

04:50.682 --> 04:53.625
Six sushi burritos.

04:53.852 --> 04:55.702
They're not stopping!

04:57.798 --> 05:01.341

We need 'em all, Chef.

05:03.787 --> 05:05.304

05:05.531 --> 05:08.473
For the last time,
you're not my type, Chef.

I need mayo.

-Ah!
-Please don't press charges.

Why didn't you wake me up?

06:13.432 --> 06:16.023
I tried, but you hit me
with a spatula.

06:17.193 --> 06:20.453
Oh, this is my only day
with all of you and I missed it.

06:20.606 --> 06:22.547
How are things
at GimmeChow, Mom?

06:22.699 --> 06:24.274
It's been two months of hell.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.471
So, how's dinner
been going without me?

06:38.624 --> 06:41.382
Great. Tonight,
we're all making lasagna.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.810
You know, cooking as a family
has been kind of fun.

06:43.962 --> 06:44.811
Right, kids?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.463
Mm-hmm.

06:46.481 --> 06:50.224
Oh... Knowing you all are making
home-cooked meals together

06:50.318 --> 06:53.303
is the only thing
getting me through this.

06:53.321 --> 06:55.580
Love you so much. Bye.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.476
She's gone. It's GimmeChow time.

06:59.478 --> 07:01.327
I'm getting pizza,
pierogis, and paella.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.571
Fish-and-chips
and cake pops for me.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.332
Guys, we've been ordering
delivery for two months.

07:06.501 --> 07:09.076

from all the lying.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.837
Or all the chile rellenos.

07:10.989 --> 07:12.431
We got to tell Mom.

07:12.582 --> 07:14.933
Hey, hey, hey.
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.084
Let's not do anything rash.

07:17.179 --> 07:20.439
We'll totally cook
for ourselves, tomorrow.

07:20.590 --> 07:22.941
But we still need to eat
tonight, right?

07:23.134 --> 07:24.684
Indian food, maybe?

07:24.836 --> 07:27.595
Well, I am a little hungry.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.190
Tofu tikka masala.

07:30.342 --> 07:33.843
Mmm. Tofu tikka masala.

07:33.862 --> 07:36.455
Tofu tikka masala. Order up.

07:36.606 --> 07:39.516
Hey, hey, good news, gang.
Don't stop working.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.026
They buzz and say stuff
to make sure

07:50.045 --> 07:53.597
you're always hustling
and a-grinding.

07:54.290 --> 07:55.307

07:55.458 --> 07:58.201
Gil, did you have a chance
to ask payroll

07:58.294 --> 07:59.794
about our overtime?

07:59.813 --> 08:02.038
You know, Marge, I did.
Funny story.

08:02.131 --> 08:04.090
Turns out,
since you work past midnight,

08:04.151 --> 08:05.967
those hours count as a new day,

08:05.986 --> 08:07.802
so you won't be
getting overtime.

08:07.896 --> 08:10.155
That story's not funny at all.
