I don't care what Bart says,

taking your cat for a walk.

00:40.766 --> 00:42.708
Oh, that's lovely.

00:42.859 --> 00:44.117
Now get out!

00:44.211 --> 00:47.713
Your mangy cat can't be
in here if she's un-vested.

00:47.864 --> 00:51.124
Oh, but my kitty
is so empathetic.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.795

Support me, Apples.

01:08.718 --> 01:10.194
Oh, boy.

Well, it was peck-and-go
for a minute there,

01:13.982 --> 01:16.149
but Gwyneth Poultry
is gonna be all right.

01:16.302 --> 01:18.151
Here's your astronomical bill.

01:18.320 --> 01:20.137
Oh, they'll be covering it.

01:20.155 --> 01:23.140
$16,000?! For a chicken?

01:23.309 --> 01:26.418
I just ate a whole bucket
of them for 20 bucks.

01:26.570 --> 01:29.646

01:40.492 --> 01:43.176
They say all it takes
to financially ruin a family

01:43.329 --> 01:45.771
is one unexpected medical bill.

01:45.922 --> 01:47.272
Who knew ours would be
for jacking up

01:47.441 --> 01:49.441

[laughs]

01:49.668 --> 01:53.612
I am so sorry. You can sell
my Malibu Stacy Dream House.

01:53.763 --> 01:57.116
It's increased in value.
I just redid the kitchen.

01:57.343 --> 01:59.843
Relax. We're not gonna
sell your toys.

01:59.862 --> 02:01.620
The sax is where
the real money is.

02:01.771 --> 02:02.846

What? My upper-lower,
middle-lower,

02:04.625 --> 02:07.442

isn't gonna get us out of this.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.111
Hmm. In order to save
this family,

02:10.131 --> 02:12.873
I'm gonna have to do something
I've never done before,

02:12.967 --> 02:14.466
get a job.

02:14.693 --> 02:16.360
Oh, you've had tons of jobs:

02:16.378 --> 02:19.696
cop, realtor, gym owner,
erotic baker,

02:19.789 --> 02:21.122
weed sommelier.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.866
Those were for my own growth.

02:22.959 --> 02:25.702
This time, it's not personal.

02:25.795 --> 02:27.962
Ooh, this one sounds perfect.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.206
They're hiring cooks.

02:29.299 --> 02:31.892
Ooh, cooking.
That's one of the only things

02:31.986 --> 02:33.543
I don't doubt myself at.

02:33.637 --> 02:36.471
"Exciting work,
competitive salary,

02:38.993 --> 02:40.475
What's GimmeChow?

02:40.494 --> 02:42.052
It's a new food delivery app.

02:42.070 --> 02:43.570
The teachers have been using it
ever since

02:43.664 --> 02:46.907
Lunch Lady Dora was on
<i> Cafeteria Nightmares.</i>

02:47.075 --> 02:50.669
[groans] They're only hiring
for evening shifts.

02:50.896 --> 02:54.247
Evenings? That's when you
and the food make dinner happen.

02:54.400 --> 02:56.082
I don't know how
to make pork chops.

02:56.235 --> 02:58.735
Where do you kill the pigs?
In the sink?

02:58.904 --> 03:01.329
Come on, guys.
We can help Mom out

03:01.348 --> 03:03.089
and cook dinner as a family.

03:03.166 --> 03:04.683
Aw, geez, you know,
I probably would not...

03:04.910 --> 03:06.000
Yeah, I'd love to, but that's...

03:06.020 --> 03:08.645
Homie, we need this.

03:10.191 --> 03:14.676
Honey, of course
we're all happy to help.

03:14.695 --> 03:17.029
Look, I'm already cooking.

03:17.180 --> 03:19.740
This is how nachos are born.

03:23.429 --> 03:26.538
Mr. Largo? But you
already have a job.

03:26.690 --> 03:29.357
I teach music
in a public school, Marge.

03:29.451 --> 03:32.044
Do the math. I sure didn't.

I like to...

04:09.641 --> 04:10.916
Oh, we got a question.

04:11.143 --> 04:14.478
Wait, so one kitchen is
pretending to be 20 restaurants

04:14.571 --> 04:16.922
when it's actually
zero restaurants?

04:17.073 --> 04:19.483
It sounds like
you're catfishing the public.

04:19.501 --> 04:22.076
Think of it as
catfish po'boy-ing them,

04:22.096 --> 04:25.338
which is a special
at Mama Juju's Bayou Bistro.

04:25.491 --> 04:27.340
How much does this job pay?

04:27.493 --> 04:29.935
-Minimum wage.
-[overlapping grumbling]

04:30.086 --> 04:33.346

Sweet, juicy overtime.

04:33.499 --> 04:35.849
That'll replace
the newspaper in your wallet.

04:36.001 --> 04:37.851
And believe me,
this job's gonna be

04:38.003 --> 04:39.987

04:45.268 --> 04:48.936
Chef? [chuckles] Wow.
No one's ever called me--

04:49.031 --> 04:50.530
Make that 11 grilled cheeses.

04:50.682 --> 04:53.625
Six sushi burritos.

04:53.852 --> 04:55.702
They're not stopping!

04:55.796 --> 04:57.779
Cheeses. I need cheeses.

04:57.798 --> 05:01.341

We need 'em all, Chef.

05:03.787 --> 05:05.304

05:05.531 --> 05:08.473
For the last time,
you're not my type, Chef.

-Please don't press charges.

Why didn't you wake me up?

06:13.432 --> 06:16.023
I tried, but you hit me
with a spatula.

06:17.193 --> 06:20.453
Oh, this is my only day
with all of you and I missed it.

06:20.606 --> 06:22.547
How are things

06:22.699 --> 06:24.274
It's been two months of hell.

So, how's dinner
been going without me?

06:38.624 --> 06:41.382
Great. Tonight,
we're all making lasagna.

06:41.402 --> 06:43.810
You know, cooking as a family
has been kind of fun.

06:43.962 --> 06:44.811
Right, kids?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.463
Mm-hmm.

06:46.481 --> 06:50.224
Oh... Knowing you all are making
home-cooked meals together

06:50.318 --> 06:53.303
is the only thing
getting me through this.

06:53.321 --> 06:55.580
Love you so much. Bye.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.476
She's gone. It's GimmeChow time.

06:59.478 --> 07:01.327
I'm getting pizza,
pierogis, and paella.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.571
Fish-and-chips
and cake pops for me.

07:03.590 --> 07:06.332
Guys, we've been ordering
delivery for two months.

from all the lying.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.837
Or all the chile rellenos.

07:10.989 --> 07:12.431
We got to tell Mom.

07:12.582 --> 07:14.933
Hey, hey, hey.
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.084
Let's not do anything rash.

07:17.179 --> 07:20.439
We'll totally cook
for ourselves, tomorrow.

07:20.590 --> 07:22.941
But we still need to eat
tonight, right?

07:23.134 --> 07:24.684
Indian food, maybe?

07:24.836 --> 07:27.595
Well, I am a little hungry.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.190
Tofu tikka masala.

07:30.342 --> 07:33.843
Mmm. Tofu tikka masala.

07:33.862 --> 07:36.455
Tofu tikka masala. Order up.

07:36.606 --> 07:39.516
Hey, hey, good news, gang.
Don't stop working.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.026
They buzz and say stuff
to make sure

07:50.045 --> 07:53.597
you're always hustling
and a-grinding.

07:54.290 --> 07:55.307
[groans softly]

07:55.458 --> 07:58.201
Gil, did you have a chance
to ask payroll

07:58.294 --> 07:59.794
about our overtime?

07:59.813 --> 08:02.038
You know, Marge, I did.
Funny story.

08:02.131 --> 08:04.090
Turns out,
since you work past midnight,

08:04.151 --> 08:05.967
those hours count as a new day,

08:05.986 --> 08:07.802
so you won't be
getting overtime.

08:07.896 --> 08:10.155
That story's not funny at all.

First, they drive-a me out
of the business,

10:07.799 --> 10:09.557
and then they rip-a me off.

10:09.634 --> 10:11.318
This is a-not okay.

10:11.394 --> 10:13.987
But I can't afford
to make-a the waves.

10:14.138 --> 10:17.324
Please just consider signing
these union cards.

10:17.551 --> 10:18.658
And keep this quiet.

10:18.810 --> 10:21.661
We don't want management
to hear about this yet.

10:28.903 --> 10:32.422
management has asked me to play
this educational video for you.

10:32.649 --> 10:34.315
So, eyes up, ingrates.

10:34.409 --> 10:36.742
<i> Hey, team,</i>
<i> if you're watching this,</i>

10:36.762 --> 10:38.653
<i>your kitchen has been infested.</i>

10:38.672 --> 10:41.414
<i> But not with mice or roaches,</i>
<i> which are fine,</i>

10:41.433 --> 10:43.767
<i> but with talk of unionizing.</i>

10:43.994 --> 10:45.769
[dramatic music plays]

10:45.920 --> 10:47.829
<i> Unionizing? What's that?</i>

10:47.889 --> 10:50.423
<i> -Sounds scary.</i>
<i> -It is, Chef.</i>

10:50.500 --> 10:53.610
<i> Joining a union would add</i>
<i>another person to your kitchen:</i>

10:53.761 --> 10:56.671
<i> -the Union Ogre.</i>
<i> -Oh!</i>

10:56.690 --> 11:00.675
<i>I create an unnecessary barrier</i>
<i> between you and management.</i>

11:00.844 --> 11:03.787
<i> And I take money</i>
<i> out of your pocket.</i>

11:04.014 --> 11:05.455
[chewing loudly]

11:05.606 --> 11:08.107
<i> Hey, I could have bought</i>
<i> a neck tattoo with that.</i>

11:08.126 --> 11:10.868
<i> Let's kill this monster</i>
<i> before he kills us.</i>

11:10.962 --> 11:12.203
[stabbing sounds over video]

11:16.868 --> 11:20.111
[scoffs]
They'd rather spend their money.

11:20.130 --> 11:22.371
-[others] Yeah.
-Where's Betty Boop?

11:22.465 --> 11:26.041
That does it. Marge,
here's my signed union card.

11:26.136 --> 11:27.602
We're with you, honey.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.216
[humming happily]

11:34.236 --> 11:36.569
[Marge]
Homie. Homie, guess what.

11:38.890 --> 11:42.057
We did it.
We started a union.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.302
Oh, that's, uh, great, honey.
[chuckles]

11:44.395 --> 11:46.137
That's great.
[belches]

11:46.139 --> 11:47.563
Whoops. Sorry.

11:47.732 --> 11:49.916
Too much Tuscan osso buco.

11:50.067 --> 11:51.233
Which we made as a family,
of course.

11:51.402 --> 11:54.403
You think management will
retaliate against me?

11:54.423 --> 11:56.664
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it,
honey.

11:56.817 --> 11:57.982
[yawns]

11:58.075 --> 12:01.076
Corporations aren't vengeful,
just people.

12:01.096 --> 12:06.349
Vengeful people.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.833
[Gil]
Good news, Marge,

12:07.927 --> 12:10.595
management's decided
to reimagine your role

12:10.747 --> 12:11.837
in the company.

12:11.857 --> 12:14.432
You're firing me
for starting a union?

12:14.509 --> 12:16.175
I wish.
We can only fire you

12:16.194 --> 12:17.510
for being bad at your job.

12:17.529 --> 12:21.256
So you just got promoted
to delivery driver.

12:21.349 --> 12:24.092
You got 60 minutes
to deliver 40 orders,

12:24.110 --> 12:30.890

<i> Delivery failed.</i>

Food's... [shrieks] here!

13:45.900 --> 13:49.068
We thought it was a hobo camp
with a stolen credit card.

13:49.162 --> 13:53.072
[gasps]
You haven't been cooking at all.

13:53.224 --> 13:54.891
-Sushi time!
-[Bart and Lisa gasp]

13:54.893 --> 13:58.077
Worst of all,
my family lied to me.

<i> No, worst of all is</i>

14:08.773 --> 14:09.764
-[grunts]
-[whimpers]

14:14.544 --> 14:15.836
I am so hungry,

14:16.005 --> 14:17.763
and Mom's eating
all the empanadas

14:17.858 --> 14:19.248
with the wrong sauces.

14:19.342 --> 14:22.343
Not the<i> verde,</i> use the<i> roja.</i>
<i> Roja!</i>

14:22.362 --> 14:23.936
She wouldn't starve her family

14:24.089 --> 14:26.180
over one little act
of betrayal, would she?

14:26.199 --> 14:29.659
Let's go for the pot stickers,
real casual.

14:31.854 --> 14:33.596
-[growls loudly]
-[all cry out]

14:33.615 --> 14:36.040
No wonder this jug
hasn't been going up.

14:36.267 --> 14:38.525
You've been getting
delivery for weeks.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.027
Honey, we tried cooking,

14:40.046 --> 14:41.713
but do you have any idea
how hard it is

14:41.864 --> 14:44.549
to make dinner
every single night?

14:44.700 --> 14:46.609
[Marge growls]

14:46.628 --> 14:49.370
My own family betrayed me.

14:49.464 --> 14:51.614
You know what family
would never do that?

14:51.707 --> 14:57.437
My union family.

14:57.931 --> 14:59.171
[gasps]

14:59.190 --> 15:00.915
What are you all doing here?

15:01.008 --> 15:02.675
Aren't you supposed to be
at work?

15:02.769 --> 15:05.619
We were so manchego cheesed
about not getting paid

15:05.621 --> 15:08.105
our overtime that we decided
to go on strike.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.533
And we can't strike
without our leader.

15:10.760 --> 15:11.759
Oh.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.428
And guess what, Tube Dress?

15:13.521 --> 15:17.098
All the other delivery app
workers are striking with us.

15:17.116 --> 15:21.210
Every food delivery app
in Springfield is shut down.

15:21.362 --> 15:22.879
Yes!

15:23.030 --> 15:26.257
[Homer]
No!

15:30.947 --> 15:33.114
Stupid strike.
I didn't realize it,

15:33.132 --> 15:35.224
but I've gotten addicted
to GimmeChow.

15:35.301 --> 15:37.618
I haven't eaten
since this whole thing started.

15:37.712 --> 15:39.729
Why don't you get something
from the cafeteria?

15:39.956 --> 15:42.899
Food only tastes good when
someone brings it to me now.

15:43.050 --> 15:45.718

15:45.812 --> 15:47.311
-[alarm stops]
-[Lenny] Whoa, geez.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.221
-Easy there, Homer.
-You could've fried

15:49.315 --> 15:51.649
every electronic device
in Springfield.

15:51.801 --> 15:55.352
Mmm, fried electronic device.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.638
Aw, that one
didn't even make sense.

15:57.732 --> 15:59.474
I'm losing it. I need to eat.

15:59.567 --> 16:01.400
I'd sign a deal
with the devil himself

16:01.419 --> 16:03.494
-to get my GimmeChow back.
-[phone rings]

16:03.588 --> 16:04.979
Hello?

16:05.072 --> 16:08.649
Yes, this is union rabble-rouser
Marge Simpson's husband.

16:08.743 --> 16:10.985
Tonight on "Dollars:
the GimmeChow Strike."

16:11.078 --> 16:14.338
Sweet for labor,
or bat for business? You decide.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.599
Zooming in from Springfield,
union capo,

16:16.751 --> 16:18.009
<i> Marge Simpson. Marge,</i>

16:18.161 --> 16:20.085
<i> I'm gonna be as impartial</i>

16:20.105 --> 16:23.922
<i> Why are you starving America</i>
<i> with your psychotic demands?</i>

16:23.942 --> 16:25.775
<i> We're not starving anyone.</i>

16:25.926 --> 16:28.002
<i> All we want is our fair share.</i>

16:28.021 --> 16:29.687
<i> Is that too much to ask?</i>

16:29.839 --> 16:31.263
<i> Yes. And here to tell us why</i>

16:31.399 --> 16:33.007

-What?

16:35.028 --> 16:37.286
Hey, Cliff.
Big fan of your whole deal.

16:37.438 --> 16:39.622
<i>Homer, you're working for them?</i>

16:39.774 --> 16:41.182
<i> I sure am.</i>

16:41.275 --> 16:43.292
<i> I was honored when GimmeChow</i>
<i> offered to pay me</i>

16:43.444 --> 16:45.703
<i> in GimmeChow gift cards</i>
<i> to talk to America</i>

16:45.855 --> 16:49.615
<i> about... "how unions</i>
<i> get in the way of innovation."</i>

16:49.709 --> 16:52.710
<i> You're in a union</i>
<i> at the nuclear plant.</i>

16:52.862 --> 16:55.972
<i> And I haven't innovated</i>
<i> one thing over there.</i>

16:56.082 --> 16:57.532
Look, we're living
in the future.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.868
This little device
can get me anything I want.

17:00.887 --> 17:04.388
Songs, sneakers, anonymous
gay hook-ups, so I hear.

17:04.541 --> 17:06.816
Why shouldn't it
also bring me food?

17:06.967 --> 17:09.377
But at the cost of human misery?

17:09.395 --> 17:12.155
Misery is how
all the best stuff is made.

17:12.306 --> 17:15.066
Pyramids, railroads, the blues,

17:15.160 --> 17:17.568
those great soccer stadiums
in Qatar,

17:17.662 --> 17:19.812
all the things America loves.

17:19.906 --> 17:22.832
Why do you hate America,
Marge? Ow!

17:22.983 --> 17:25.168
-[grunting]
-Hey! Ow! Marge, stop.

17:25.319 --> 17:26.819
I encourage everyone

with us.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.352
[all]
Hey, hey, we get how you feel.

17:43.580 --> 17:45.596
Oh, that's so nice.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.249
[all]
Now get in the kitchen
and cook our meals.

17:48.342 --> 17:51.085
-What?
-Attention, union thugs.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.679
The eaters of Springfield
have had enough.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.923
You have awoken a lazy giant.

17:56.016 --> 17:59.760
You're just corporate shills
standing in the way of justice.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.562
Shut up, burger flippers.

18:01.564 --> 18:05.691
Just for that, I'm gonna spit in
your face instead of your food.

18:05.768 --> 18:09.587
[all yelling]

18:12.775 --> 18:14.458
Good news, everyone.

18:14.569 --> 18:16.611
I found a way to end the strike.

[cheering]

18:18.147 --> 18:19.630
You're meeting our demands?

18:19.782 --> 18:21.874
No. I'm firing everyone.

18:22.009 --> 18:23.300
[others]
Aw...

18:23.394 --> 18:27.396
Because GimmeChow Ghost Kitchens
are now fully robotic.

18:27.548 --> 18:31.400
And food deliveries are back
with non-complaining drones.

18:35.556 --> 18:38.407
[sighs] I guess the greed
of the most selfish

18:38.559 --> 18:41.318
will always squash any hope
of a decent life

18:41.471 --> 18:44.805
-for the rest of us.
-Oh, my guy.

18:44.824 --> 18:45.973
Great work, Homer.

18:46.066 --> 18:47.475
Really, I could not
have busted up

18:47.477 --> 18:48.734
this union without you.

18:48.903 --> 18:51.904
And stabbing your wife
in the back? [chuckling] Nice.

18:51.998 --> 18:54.148
Gee, when you say it like that,

18:54.167 --> 18:58.094
it sounds like I stabbed
my wife in the back.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.346
[drone whirring]

19:04.827 --> 19:07.328
Oh... I thought that fried food

19:07.421 --> 19:09.180
delivered by electronic devices

19:09.332 --> 19:11.015
would've been
my dream come true.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.334
[gasps] That's it.

19:14.337 --> 19:18.531
Fried electronic devices,
now it makes sense.

My work is done.

19:29.519 --> 19:32.128
[cheering]

19:33.523 --> 19:36.524
The malfunctioning drones
are dropping everything

19:36.542 --> 19:38.693
from apple pies
to zucchini fries,

19:38.786 --> 19:42.788
but nothing is tanking faster
than GimmeChow stock.

19:42.807 --> 19:44.957
Props, where the hell's my tank?

19:44.976 --> 19:47.292
I can't get disrupted.
I'm the disruptor.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.645
I'm the crusher of unions.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.372
I'm the... Oh! [screams]

19:51.465 --> 19:54.058
That's what I get for using
non-union prop guys.

19:54.210 --> 19:56.110
[Homer]
Marge!

19:57.897 --> 20:01.882
Homer, only you could make
a mess this big.

20:01.976 --> 20:04.068
I did it for you, honey.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.554
All the food in the world
means nothing to me

20:06.647 --> 20:10.041

from choking on it.
