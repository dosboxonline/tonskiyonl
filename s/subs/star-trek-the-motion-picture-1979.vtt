06:06.867 --> 06:09.535
Come in, Columbia. Respond, please.

06:15.917 --> 06:20.629
This is Epsilon IX, Columbia.
<i>Am boosting output. How read you this?</i>

07:05.842 --> 07:09.595
Our sensor drone is intercepting this
on Quad L-14.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.348
That's within Klingon boundaries.
Who are they fighting?

07:12.432 --> 07:13.933
Unknown, sir.

07:15.685 --> 07:17.520
l have an exterior visual.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.429
We've plotted a course
on that cloud, Commander.

08:34.514 --> 08:38.100
lt will pass into Federation space
fairly close to us.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.019
Heading?

08:40.477 --> 08:43.355
Sir, it's on a precise heading for Earth.

09:38.328 --> 09:45.292
Our ancestors cast out their animal
passions here on these sands.

09:45.877 --> 09:52.508
Our race was saved by the
attainment of Kolinahr.

09:52.592 --> 09:56.387
Kolinahr: through which all emotion
is finally shed.

09:56.471 --> 10:00.975
You have laboured long, Spock...

10:01.059 --> 10:05.688
Now receive from us this symbol
of total logic.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.300
Your thoughts... give them to me.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.516
Our minds, Spock...

10:43.059 --> 10:46.020
...one and together

10:58.408 --> 11:02.119
This consciousness calling to you
from space...

11:02.203 --> 11:05.706
lt touches your human blood, Spock.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.551
You have not achieved Kolinahr.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.765
His answer lies elsewhere.

11:24.225 --> 11:27.144
He will not achieve his goal with us.

11:29.272 --> 11:33.275
Live long and prosper, Spock.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.953
Commander Sonak,

12:26.538 --> 12:28.747
you received your appointment
as Enterprise science officer?

12:28.832 --> 12:30.749
Based, l am told,
on your recommendation, Admiral.

12:30.834 --> 12:32.251
-Thank you.
-Then why aren't you aboard?

12:32.335 --> 12:34.753
Captain Decker requested l complete
final science briefing here

12:34.838 --> 12:37.506
-before we leave on our mission.
-Here? At Starfleet?

12:39.342 --> 12:42.094
The Enterprise is
in final preparation to leave dock.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.012
Which will require 20 more hours
at minimum.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.014
Twelve.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.891
l'm on my way to a meeting
with Admiral Nogura

12:47.976 --> 12:50.185
which will not last
more than three minutes.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.062
Report to me on
the Enterprise in one hour.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.313
Report to you, sir?

12:53.398 --> 12:58.235
lt is my intention to be on that ship
following that meeting.

12:58.319 --> 13:00.070
Report to me in one hour.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.477
-Admiral!
-Mr Scott.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.688
Those departure orders, 1 2 hours,
Starfleet cannot be serious.

14:16.773 --> 14:19.149
Why aren't the Enterprise transporters
operating, Mr Scott?

14:19.234 --> 14:21.026
A wee problem, sir. Just temporary.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.445
Admiral, we have just
finished 1 8 months

14:23.530 --> 14:25.405
redesigning and refitting the Enterprise.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.200
How in the name of hell do they expect
me to have her ready in 1 2 hours?

14:28.284 --> 14:29.993
Take me over, please.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.208
She needs more work, sir.
A shakedown.

14:36.292 --> 14:41.171
Mr Scott, an alien object of
unbelievable destructive power

14:41.256 --> 14:43.715
is less than three days away
from this planet.

14:43.800 --> 14:47.469
The only starship in interception range
is the Enterprise.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.639
Ready or not, she launches in 1 2 hours.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.580
The crew haven't had
near enough transition time

15:14.664 --> 15:15.998
with all the new equipment.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.128
And the engines, they're
not even tested at warp power.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.131
And an untried captain.

15:24.215 --> 15:26.633
Two and a half years
as chief of Starfleet operations

15:26.718 --> 15:28.760
may have made me a little stale,

15:28.845 --> 15:31.513
but l wouldn't exactly consider
myself untried.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.271
-They gave her back to me, Scotty.
-"Gave" her back, sir?

15:39.480 --> 15:42.357
Well, l doubt it was
that easy with Nogura.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.859
You're right.

15:46.362 --> 15:50.741
Well, any man
who could manage such a feat,

15:50.825 --> 15:53.785
l would not dare to disappoint.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.955
She'll launch on time, sir.
And she'll be ready.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.413
<i>-Pod secured.</i>
-Thank you, Mr Scott.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.874
-Aye, sir.
<i>-Pressure equalised.</i>

20:52.001 --> 20:57.339
<i>Attention, launch crew, a travel pod</i>
<i>is now available at cargo six.</i>

20:59.216 --> 21:01.134
-Permission to come aboard, sir.
-Granted, sir.

21:01.218 --> 21:02.928
Welcome aboard, Admiral.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.221
Commander Scott, you're needed
in engineering immediately.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.765
Sir, you'll excuse me.

21:06.849 --> 21:08.683
<i>Attention, launch crew.</i>

21:08.768 --> 21:12.103
<i>A travel pod is now</i>
<i>available at cargo six.</i>

21:12.772 --> 21:15.440
<i>Travel pod available. Cargo six.</i>

21:15.524 --> 21:18.652
-Sir, if you'll follow me, l'll show you...
-l think l can find my way, Ensign.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.196
Aye, sir.

21:25.493 --> 21:26.534
Bridge.

21:31.958 --> 21:32.999
What's the problem?

21:33.084 --> 21:35.543
l thought you people had that circuit
patched in an hour ago!

21:35.628 --> 21:38.046
We did. We had to disconnect it again
so we could tie in radio messaging.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.547
All right. Take out...

21:44.762 --> 21:47.847
All right, as soon as
somebody can get to it.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.643
-What's the next programme?
-Go ahead.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.561
l'll get somebody down there
as soon as l can.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.730
Cleary, my people are all tied up now.

21:59.735 --> 22:03.989
Captain, Starfleet just signalled your
transfer-of-command order, sir.

22:06.117 --> 22:08.410
-Captain.
-l appreciate the welcome.

22:09.203 --> 22:11.371
l wish the circumstances
were less critical.

22:11.455 --> 22:14.249
Epsilon lX is monitoring the intruder.
Keep a channel open to them.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.583
Aye, sir.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.420
Where's Captain Decker?

22:18.504 --> 22:20.672
He's in engineering, sir.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.507
He...

22:22.591 --> 22:23.591
He doesn't know.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.013
-Mr Chekov.
-Aye, sir.

22:28.097 --> 22:31.683
Assemble the crew on the recreation
deck at 0400 hours.

22:31.767 --> 22:33.810
l want to show them what we're facing.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.026
<i>Engineering to all decks,</i>

22:41.485 --> 22:44.571
<i>auxiliary power test in three minutes.</i>

22:48.784 --> 22:50.660
Check Cleary on number six.

22:50.745 --> 22:53.079
<i>Engineering to all decks,</i>

22:53.456 --> 22:56.750
<i>auxiliary power test in three minutes.</i>

22:57.168 --> 22:58.168
<i>Mark.</i>

23:08.345 --> 23:10.680
<i>Space matrix restoration coils.</i>

23:11.599 --> 23:12.974
<i>Dilithium crystals.</i>

23:13.517 --> 23:16.936
l knew it! The transporter sensor
was not activated.

23:18.606 --> 23:19.814
Faulty modules.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.567
Cleary! Put a new backup sensor
into the unit.

23:22.651 --> 23:23.902
Aye, sir.

23:23.986 --> 23:26.154
-Ready.
<i>-Emergency shut-down trip.</i>

23:26.906 --> 23:30.033
Admiral Kirk!
Well, we're getting a top-brass sendoff.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.202
Don't worry. She'll launch on schedule,

23:32.286 --> 23:33.870
if we have to tow her out
with our bare hands.

23:33.954 --> 23:37.665
-Right, Scotty?
-Aye, that we will, sir.

23:39.001 --> 23:41.169
-Let's talk.
-Sure.

23:41.253 --> 23:42.462
Let me know when that backup's ready.

23:42.546 --> 23:43.630
Aye, sir.

23:43.714 --> 23:46.800
All due respect, sir, l hope this isn't
some kind of Starfleet pep talk.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.051
l'm really too busy.

23:48.135 --> 23:50.220
l'm taking over the centre seat, Will.

23:50.805 --> 23:52.013
You're what?

23:52.098 --> 23:54.432
l'm replacing you as
captain of the Enterprise.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.185
You'll stay on as executive officer,

23:57.770 --> 24:00.396
temporary grade reduction
to commander.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.110
You, personally,
are assuming command?

24:05.194 --> 24:06.236
Yeah.

24:07.029 --> 24:10.073
-May l ask why?
-My experience.

24:11.242 --> 24:14.077
Five years out there
dealing with unknowns like this.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.455
My familiarity with the Enterprise,
its crew.

24:17.540 --> 24:21.042
Admiral, this is
an almost totally new Enterprise.

24:21.127 --> 24:22.836
You don't know her
a tenth as well as l do!

24:22.920 --> 24:24.879
That's why you're staying aboard.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.804
l'm sorry, Will.

24:32.888 --> 24:35.598
No, Admiral. l don't think you're sorry.

24:36.267 --> 24:38.059
Not one damn bit.

24:39.854 --> 24:42.313
l remember when you recommended
me for this command.

24:42.398 --> 24:43.731
You told me how envious you were

24:43.816 --> 24:47.610
and how much you hoped you'd find
a way to get a starship command again.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.780
Well, sir,

24:52.116 --> 24:53.867
it looks like you found a way.

24:57.580 --> 25:00.748
Report to the bridge, Commander,
immediately.

25:03.711 --> 25:05.086
Aye, sir.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.267
Transporter room, come in! Urgent!

25:19.351 --> 25:21.186
Red line on the transporter, Mr Scott.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.521
Transporter! Do not engage.

25:23.606 --> 25:26.608
-lt's too late. They're beaming now.
-Do not...

25:27.359 --> 25:31.571
<i>Do you read me, Starfleet?</i>
<i>Override it. Pull them back.</i>

25:31.780 --> 25:33.781
<i>Unable to retrieve their pattern,</i>
Enterprise.

25:37.119 --> 25:40.955
<i>Malfunction! Malfunction! Malfunction!</i>

25:41.290 --> 25:43.917
<i>-Malfunction! Malfunction!</i>
-Give it to me!

25:44.001 --> 25:46.211
<i>Malfunction!</i>

25:47.796 --> 25:51.341
Starfleet, boost your matter gain.
We need more signal.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.057
-More signal!
-We're losing their pattern.

25:59.141 --> 26:01.392
Oh, no. They're forming.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.203
Oh, my God.

26:27.378 --> 26:29.420
Starfleet, do you have them?

26:30.589 --> 26:34.926
Enterprise, what we got back
<i>didn't live long.</i>

26:35.010 --> 26:36.177
<i>Fortunately.</i>

26:41.392 --> 26:43.017
Starfleet, Kirk.

26:45.354 --> 26:48.022
Please express my condolences
to their families.

26:49.900 --> 26:53.611
Commander Sonak's can be reached
through the Vulcan Embassy.

26:59.368 --> 27:02.078
There was nothing you
could have done, Rand.

27:02.162 --> 27:04.038
lt wasn't your fault.

27:28.480 --> 27:32.150
-Yeoman, turboshaft eight?
-Back that way, sir.

27:39.199 --> 27:41.743
We have to replace Commander Sonak.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.080
l'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible.

27:46.248 --> 27:47.999
None available, Captain.

27:48.083 --> 27:51.169
ln fact, there's no one
who's fully rated on this design.

27:51.754 --> 27:53.421
You are, Mr Decker.

27:53.839 --> 27:56.758
l'm afraid you're gonna have
to double as science officer.

28:29.083 --> 28:30.875
That's all we know about it.

28:32.795 --> 28:36.464
Except that it is now 53.4 hours
away from Earth.

28:40.302 --> 28:44.430
Enterprise is the only Federation
starship that stands in its way.

28:44.515 --> 28:49.060
We assume that there is a vessel of
some type at the heart of the cloud.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.563
Our orders are to intercept,

28:53.023 --> 28:56.484
investigate and take whatever action
is necessary

28:57.736 --> 28:59.112
and possible.

29:03.242 --> 29:06.911
We can only hope that there is
a life form aboard that vessel

29:06.995 --> 29:09.622
that reasons the way we do.

29:14.461 --> 29:17.713
<i>Bridge to Captain.</i>
<i>Priority signal from Epsilon lX.</i>

29:18.173 --> 29:19.882

<i>-Some kind of power surge.</i>
<i>-Receiving an odd pattern now!</i>

29:50.456 --> 29:53.624
<i>Enterprise, they could be mistaking</i>
<i>our scans as a hostile act.</i>

29:53.709 --> 29:55.460
<i>They seem to be reacting</i>
<i>to our scans, sir.</i>

l was stationed on the lieutenant's
home planet some years ago.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.190
Commander Decker?

32:24.359 --> 32:26.027
Yes, our exec and science officer.

32:26.111 --> 32:28.404
Captain Kirk has
the utmost confidence in me.

32:30.824 --> 32:32.783
And, in you, too, Lieutenant.

32:32.868 --> 32:35.536
My oath of celibacy
is on record, Captain.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.913
-May l assume my duties?
-By all means.

32:39.958 --> 32:41.125
Captain?

32:41.209 --> 32:44.086
Starfleet reports our last six crew
members are ready to beam up,

32:44.171 --> 32:47.798
but one of them is refusing
to step into the transporter.

32:47.883 --> 32:51.052
Oh? l'll see to it that he beams up.

32:52.054 --> 32:53.638
Transporter room.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.286
Well, for a man who swore
he'd never return to the Starfleet...

33:17.371 --> 33:19.580
Just a moment, Captain, sir.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.083
l'll explain what happened.

33:22.584 --> 33:24.293
Your revered Admiral Nogura

33:24.378 --> 33:28.964
invoked a little known, seldom used
reserve activation clause.

33:29.341 --> 33:32.259
ln simpler language, Captain,
they drafted me.

33:32.386 --> 33:33.803
They didn't.

33:35.847 --> 33:39.141
This was your idea.
This was your idea, wasn't it?

33:39.226 --> 33:40.685
Bones, there's a thing out there.

33:40.769 --> 33:43.938
Why is any object we don't understand
always called a "thing"?

33:44.022 --> 33:45.606
Headed this way.

33:46.316 --> 33:47.775
l need you.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.905
Damn it, Bones. l need you.

33:53.990 --> 33:54.990
Badly!

34:08.130 --> 34:12.216
-Permission to come aboard?
<i>-Permission granted, sir.</i>

34:16.972 --> 34:18.431
Well, Jim.

34:19.099 --> 34:21.266
l hear Chapel's an MD now.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.353
Well, l'm going to need a top nurse.

34:24.438 --> 34:27.606
Not a doctor who'll argue
every little diagnosis with me.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.902
And they probably redesigned
the whole sickbay, too.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.655
l know engineers.
They love to change things.

34:56.178 --> 34:58.971
Dock control reports ready, sir.

34:59.431 --> 35:02.349
-Helm ready, sir.
-Orbital departure on plot, sir.

35:08.231 --> 35:10.483
-Manoeuvring thrusters, sir.
-Hold station.

35:11.485 --> 35:13.360

38:30.767 --> 38:33.894
Science officer's computation
confirmed, sir.

38:43.405 --> 38:46.657
Well, Bones, do the new medical
facilities meet with your approval?

38:46.741 --> 38:50.119
They do not. lt's like working
in a damned computer centre.

38:50.203 --> 38:51.161
Programming ready?

38:51.246 --> 38:53.622
Programme set for
standard warp entry, Captain,

38:54.207 --> 38:56.667
but l still recommend
further simulation study.

38:57.252 --> 39:01.463
Mr Decker, every minute brings
that object closer to Earth.

39:03.717 --> 39:05.259
Engineering, stand by for warp drive.

39:05.343 --> 39:08.554
<i>Captain, we need further</i>
<i>warp simulation on the flow sensors.</i>

39:08.722 --> 39:11.098
Engineer, we need warp speed now.

39:11.182 --> 39:12.349
Jim?

39:13.601 --> 39:15.019
You're pushing.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.772
Your people know theirjobs.

39:20.567 --> 39:22.568
That's it, sir. l can't do any better.

39:24.654 --> 39:25.821
Aye, lad.

39:28.783 --> 39:30.367
lt's borderline
on the simulator, Captain.

39:30.452 --> 39:32.786
l cannot guarantee that she'll hold up.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.329
Warp drive, Mr Scott.

39:34.456 --> 39:38.167
-Ahead, warp 1 , Mr Sulu.
-Accelerating to warp 1 , sir.

-No manual response, sir.

41:02.502 --> 41:04.545

41:05.046 --> 41:07.339
Wormhole distortion has overloaded

41:07.423 --> 41:10.008
Navigational deflectors
inoperative, Captain.

41:11.219 --> 41:13.345
Directional control also inoperative.

41:20.103 --> 41:22.354

41:22.897 --> 41:24.940
Twenty seconds.

41:25.525 --> 41:28.902
Mr Chekov, stand by on phasers.

41:29.612 --> 41:30.946
No!

41:34.659 --> 41:38.120
Belay that phaser order!

41:48.423 --> 41:51.091

41:57.765 --> 42:01.518
Photon torpedoes

43:32.193 --> 43:36.071
-Position report, Navigator.
-Computing new intersection course.

43:36.155 --> 43:38.115

43:38.199 --> 43:42.202
Negative damage reported, Captain.
No casualties reported, Doctor.

43:42.870 --> 43:45.414
Wrong, Mr Chekov,
there are casualties.

43:45.707 --> 43:47.040
My wits!

43:48.042 --> 43:50.752
As in "frightened out of," Captain, sir.

43:51.671 --> 43:53.255
We're at warp 0.8.

43:53.798 --> 43:55.382
Engineer, report your status there.

43:56.551 --> 43:59.970
ln just a second, Exec.
We're picking up the pieces down here!

44:02.390 --> 44:04.308
Mr Scott, we need warp drive
as soon as possible.

44:04.392 --> 44:06.643
Captain, it was the engine imbalance

44:06.728 --> 44:09.271
that created the wormhole
in the first place.

44:09.355 --> 44:11.440
<i>lt will happen again</i>
<i>if we don't correct it.</i>

44:11.524 --> 44:13.483
That object is less than two days
away from Earth.

44:13.568 --> 44:16.903
We need to intercept
while it still is out there.

44:16.988 --> 44:18.488
Navigator, lay in a new heading

44:18.573 --> 44:21.742
to conform with our initial lP
with the intruder.

44:21.951 --> 44:23.660
Mr Sulu, you have the conn.

44:23.745 --> 44:27.247
Mr Decker, l'd like to
see you in my quarters.

44:27.373 --> 44:29.583
Mind if l tag along, Captain?

44:33.421 --> 44:34.713
Level five.

44:42.597 --> 44:45.599
All right, explanation. Why was
my phaser order countermanded?

44:45.683 --> 44:48.643
Sir, the Enterprise redesign
increases phaser power

44:48.728 --> 44:51.021
by channelling it through
the main engines.

44:51.105 --> 44:53.565
When they went
into anti-matter imbalance,

44:53.649 --> 44:56.068
the phasers were automatically cut off.

44:59.655 --> 45:01.782
Then you acted properly, of course.

45:02.617 --> 45:04.826
Thank you, sir.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.996
l'm sorry if l embarrassed you.

45:09.624 --> 45:12.459
-You saved the ship.
-l'm aware of that, sir.

45:12.960 --> 45:16.463
Stop competing with me, Decker!

45:18.633 --> 45:20.634
-Permission to speak freely, sir?
-Granted!

45:20.718 --> 45:24.930
Sir, you haven't logged a single
star hour in two and a half years.

45:25.848 --> 45:29.142
That, plus your unfamiliarity with
the ship's redesign, in my opinion, sir,

45:29.227 --> 45:31.728
seriously jeopardises this mission.

45:37.235 --> 45:39.986
l trust you will

45:40.321 --> 45:43.949
nursemaid me through
these difficulties, mister?

45:44.033 --> 45:45.409
Yes, sir, l'll do that.

45:45.493 --> 45:48.120
Then l won't keep you from
your duties any longer, Commander.

45:48.496 --> 45:50.414
-Yes, Doctor?
-Aye, sir.

45:57.463 --> 45:59.464
He may be right, Jim.

46:08.224 --> 46:10.851
Was it difficult?

46:10.935 --> 46:12.561
No more than l expected.

46:12.645 --> 46:14.855
About as difficult as seeing you again.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.525
l'm sorry.

46:18.609 --> 46:22.529
That you left Delta lV?
Or that you didn't even say goodbye?

46:25.575 --> 46:28.910
lf l had seen you again,

46:28.995 --> 46:31.121
would you have been able to say it?

46:33.458 --> 46:34.958
No.

46:47.930 --> 46:49.598
Make your point, Doctor.

46:49.891 --> 46:53.059
The point, Captain, is that
it's you who's competing.

46:53.144 --> 46:55.812
You rammed getting this command
down Starfleet's throat.

46:55.897 --> 46:58.565
You've used this emergency
to get the Enterprise back.

47:02.278 --> 47:04.237
And l intend to keep her,
is that what you're saying?

47:04.322 --> 47:07.699
Yes. lt's an obsession.

47:08.576 --> 47:09.910
An obsession that can blind you

47:09.994 --> 47:13.288
to far more immediate
and critical responsibilities.

47:13.831 --> 47:17.834
Your reaction to Decker
is an example, Jim.

47:17.919 --> 47:20.754
<i>-Bridge to Captain.</i>

50:19.767 --> 50:21.017

50:21.102 --> 50:23.645
Of course not. l'm well aware

reporting as ordered, Captain.

52:55.214 --> 52:58.216
Please, sit down.

52:58.300 --> 53:00.218
Spock, you haven't changed a bit.

53:00.302 --> 53:03.054
You're just as warm and
sociable as ever.

53:03.430 --> 53:05.348
Nor have you, Doctor,

53:05.432 --> 53:09.143
as your continued predilection
for irrelevancy demonstrates.

53:09.270 --> 53:10.812
Gentlemen.

53:12.773 --> 53:17.694
At last report, you were on Vulcan,
apparently to stay.

53:17.987 --> 53:21.447
Yes, you were undergoing
the Kolinahr discipline.

53:22.658 --> 53:23.700
Sit down.

53:23.784 --> 53:28.538
lf you are referring to the Kolinahr,
Doctor, you are correct.

53:28.622 --> 53:31.499
Well, however it's pronounced,
Mr Spock,

53:31.584 --> 53:36.379
it's the Vulcan ritual that's supposed
to purge all remaining emotions.

53:36.463 --> 53:39.716
The Kolinahr is also
a discipline you broke

53:39.800 --> 53:41.551
to join us.

53:43.178 --> 53:46.973
Will you please sit down?

53:58.360 --> 54:01.112
On Vulcan l began
sensing a consciousness

54:01.196 --> 54:04.782
from a source more powerful
than l have ever encountered.

54:04.867 --> 54:08.036
Thought patterns
of exactingly, perfect order.

54:08.120 --> 54:11.039
l believe they emanate
from the intruder.

54:11.123 --> 54:13.458
l believe it may hold my answers.

54:13.834 --> 54:17.420
Well, isn't it lucky for you that we just
happened to be heading your way?

54:18.505 --> 54:20.548
Bones!

54:21.884 --> 54:23.343
We need him.

54:25.721 --> 54:26.804
l need him.

54:28.349 --> 54:31.100
Then my presence is to
our mutual advantage?

54:37.483 --> 54:40.193
Any thought patterns you might sense,

54:42.363 --> 54:44.322
whether they appear to
affect you personally or not,

54:44.406 --> 54:46.616
l expect immediately reported.

54:46.700 --> 54:48.201
Of course, Captain.

54:49.411 --> 54:51.412
ls there anything else?

54:51.830 --> 54:52.830
No.

55:03.884 --> 55:05.385
Jim?

55:08.597 --> 55:13.476
lf this super-intelligence is as important
to him as he says it is,

55:14.228 --> 55:15.561
how do we know...

55:15.646 --> 55:18.564
That he wouldn't put his own
interests ahead of the ship's?

55:21.235 --> 55:22.276
l could never believe that.

55:22.361 --> 55:23.653
<i>Bridge to officer's lounge.</i>

55:23.737 --> 55:27.907
<i>Captain Kirk, revised estimate</i>
<i>on cloud visual contact, 3.7 minutes.</i>

55:28.659 --> 55:36.082
<i>Red Alert! Red Alert!</i>

55:45.759 --> 55:47.260
Standard light, Engineer.

55:49.096 --> 55:51.472
-Full mag on viewer!
-Full mag, sir.

56:00.941 --> 56:01.941
Linguacode?

56:02.026 --> 56:04.235
Continuing friendship messages
on all frequencies, sir.

56:04.319 --> 56:06.612
All decks and divisions confirmed.
Status Red.

56:06.780 --> 56:11.200
-Captain, we are being scanned.
-Do no return scan, Mr Spock.

56:12.244 --> 56:14.037
lt could be misinterpreted as hostility.

56:14.121 --> 56:17.290
lntruder scans emanating from
the exact centre of the cloud.

56:18.125 --> 56:21.919
Energy of a type
never before encountered.

56:30.679 --> 56:32.805
There's no response to
friendship messages, sir.

56:32.890 --> 56:34.265
Shall l go to battle stations, sir?

56:34.349 --> 56:36.392
Negative. We'll take
no provocative action.

56:36.477 --> 56:40.188
Recommend defensive posture,
Captain. Screens and shields.

56:41.190 --> 56:45.651
No, Mr Decker. That could
also be misinterpreted as hostile.

56:47.529 --> 56:49.322
Cloud composition, Mr Spock?

56:49.490 --> 56:51.949
-Twelfth power energy field.
-Twelfth power?

56:52.034 --> 56:53.659
Captain, we've seen what
their weapons can do.

56:53.744 --> 56:55.244
Shouldn't we take
every possible precaution?

56:55.329 --> 56:57.497
-Mr Decker...
-Captain.

56:57.581 --> 57:01.084
l suspect there's an object
at the heart of that cloud.

57:05.714 --> 57:07.673
Mr Decker, l will not provoke an attack.

57:07.800 --> 57:09.217
lf that order isn't clear enough for you...

57:09.301 --> 57:13.721
Captain, as your exec,
it's my duty to point out alternatives.

57:15.474 --> 57:18.101
Yes, it is.

57:18.185 --> 57:19.644
l stand corrected.

57:19.728 --> 57:21.395
Five minutes to cloud boundary.

57:21.480 --> 57:25.775
Navigator, lay in a conic section
flight path to the cloud centre.

57:25.859 --> 57:29.278
Bring us parallel to whatever
we find in there.

57:29.363 --> 57:32.657
-Mr Sulu, tactical plot on viewer.
-Tactical on viewer, sir.

57:47.840 --> 57:50.049
That measures twelfth power energy?

57:52.010 --> 57:54.720
Thousands of starships couldn't
generate that much...

57:55.931 --> 57:57.223
Mr Spock?

58:01.353 --> 58:02.812
Spock, tell me.

58:11.321 --> 58:14.490
l sense puzzlement.

58:16.368 --> 58:18.786
We have been contacted.

58:20.372 --> 58:22.248
Why have we not replied?

58:22.749 --> 58:24.709
Contacted?

58:24.793 --> 58:25.918
How?

58:27.421 --> 58:28.421
Standard on viewer.

58:28.505 --> 58:30.548
Force fields up full! Deflectors, now!

58:30.632 --> 58:34.594
<i>Mark, zero. lncoming fire ahead.</i>

58:34.678 --> 58:37.013
Force fields and deflectors
up full, Captain!

58:45.606 --> 58:46.731
Analysis, Mr Spock.

58:46.815 --> 58:49.775
Alien weapon is a form of
plasma energy, Captain.

58:49.860 --> 58:54.155
Exact composition, unknown.
Guidance system, unknown.

58:56.867 --> 58:58.701
All decks brace for impact.

59:07.169 --> 59:09.503
Registering power loss on force fields!

59:09.588 --> 59:11.297
Engineering, what's happening
to our force fields?

59:11.381 --> 59:13.216
Systems overloading, Captain!

59:23.268 --> 59:25.978
-Medic.
-Medics are coming.

59:37.658 --> 59:39.408
The new screens held.

59:39.493 --> 59:42.912
Engineering to bridge.
Cannot hold full power on force fields!

59:42.996 --> 59:45.790
Deflector power is down 70%!

59:45.874 --> 59:47.792
Divert auxiliary power to deflectors.

59:51.838 --> 59:54.173
Captain.

59:54.258 --> 59:56.926
The intruder has been attempting
to communicate.

59:57.010 --> 01:00:00.179
Our previous transmission
mode was too primitive to be received.

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:03.266
l am now programming our computer
to transmit linguacode

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:05.851
at their frequency and rate of speed.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:07.937
Commander.

01:00:17.197 --> 01:00:19.031
Spock.

01:00:24.663 --> 01:00:26.289
Here it comes!

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.707
Engineering! Status report!

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:31.294
Our shields cannot handle
another attack.

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:32.837
Mr Spock!

01:00:37.134 --> 01:00:38.884
lmpact in 20 seconds.

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:42.305
Spock!

01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:44.807
1 5 seconds!

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:47.143
Spock! Transmit now!

01:00:47.227 --> 01:00:49.520
1 0 seconds.

01:00:49.604 --> 01:00:50.604
Transmitting.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:04.452
lt would seem our friendship messages

01:01:04.578 --> 01:01:07.496
have been received
and understood, Mr Spock.

01:01:07.581 --> 01:01:10.624
l would say that was
a logical assumption, Captain.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:15.087
-Mr Sulu, hold present position.
-Holding present position, sir.

01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:25.264
Tactical plot on viewer.

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.975
Course projection on tactical, sir.

01:01:33.857 --> 01:01:37.234
-Opinion, Mr Spock.
-Recommend we proceed, Captain.

01:01:38.362 --> 01:01:41.197
-Mr Decker?
-l advise caution, Captain.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:43.032
We can't withstand another attack.

01:01:43.116 --> 01:01:45.743
That thing is 20 hours away from Earth.

01:01:45.827 --> 01:01:48.871
-We know nothing about it as yet.
-Precisely the point, Captain.

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:52.666
We don't know what it'll do.
Moving into that cloud at this time

01:01:53.794 --> 01:01:55.753
is an unwarranted gamble.

01:01:56.838 --> 01:01:59.131
How do you define "unwarranted"?

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:04.637
You asked my opinion, sir.

01:02:12.104 --> 01:02:14.313
Viewer, standard ahead.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:28.702
Navigator, maintain course.
Helmsman, steady as she goes.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:45.756
No vessel could generate
a power field of this magnitude.

01:04:47.801 --> 01:04:50.094
Spock?

01:04:52.389 --> 01:04:54.390
lnstruments fluctuating, Captain.

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:59.270
Patterns unrecognisable.

01:06:43.541 --> 01:06:45.000
Transmit image of alien to Starfleet.

01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:46.669
Advise we are
attempting further communication.

01:06:46.753 --> 01:06:49.713
Unable to make contact
with Starfleet, Captain.

01:06:49.798 --> 01:06:53.759
Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud
is being reflected back!

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:05.104
We are closing on it rapidly, Captain.

01:07:13.780 --> 01:07:16.907
Reduce magnification,
factor four, Mr Sulu.

01:07:16.991 --> 01:07:19.034
We're already two settings
below that, sir.

01:07:23.373 --> 01:07:25.582
Mr Sulu,

01:07:25.667 --> 01:07:31.630
bring us into a parallel course
over the alien at 500 metres.

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:34.091
500 metres?

01:07:35.301 --> 01:07:39.555
Then take us out to 1 00 kilometres
distance, adjusting parallel course.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:42.558
Aye, sir.

01:09:42.845 --> 01:09:46.139
-Viewer astern.
-Reverse angle on the viewer, Captain.

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:10.497
Five hundred metres.
Viewer ahead, sir.

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:42.357
Hold relative position here.

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:52.451
<i>lntruder Alert! lntruder Alert!</i>

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:26.485
Mr Spock, can that
be one of their crew?

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:32.115
A probe from their vessel, Captain.
Plasma, energy combination.

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:36.620
Don't interfere with it!

01:13:36.704 --> 01:13:38.914
Absolutely, l will not interfere.

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:42.834
No one interfere!

01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:45.879
lt doesn't seem interested in us!

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:48.215
Only the ship.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.816
Computer off!

01:14:12.949 --> 01:14:15.033
lt's taken control of the computer.

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:24.709
lt's running our records!
Earth defences! Starfleet strength!

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:07.085
llia!

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:32.569
This is how l define unwarranted.

01:15:42.455 --> 01:15:45.498
Activate auxiliary computer circuits
through manual shutoff.

01:15:50.338 --> 01:16:00.555
<i>Emergency Alert!</i>
<i>Negative control at helm!</i>

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.641
Force fields! Full remaining strength!
Total reserve!

01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:05.435
This ship is under attack.
Man all defensive stations.

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:14.361
Captain, we've been
seized by a tractor beam.

01:16:14.445 --> 01:16:16.821
Get someone up here to take
the navigator's station.

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:18.615
-Engineering!
-Chief DiFalco, to the bridge!

01:16:18.699 --> 01:16:19.783
Emergency power!

01:16:19.867 --> 01:16:23.119
Going to full emergency!

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:27.624
But, Captain, if we don't break
free in 1 5 seconds, she'll burn up!

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:29.376
We cannot break free, Captain.

01:16:29.460 --> 01:16:31.753
We have only a fraction
of the power necessary.

01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:36.341
Engineering, belay that order.
Disengage all main drive systems.

01:16:54.402 --> 01:16:57.529
Chief DiFalco,
take over Lieutenant llia's station.

01:17:04.036 --> 01:17:06.538
DiFalco, disengage engine
navigation relays now!

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:07.664
Aye, sir.

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:11.334
Force field circuits E 1 0 through 14
show ready for reactivation.

01:17:11.419 --> 01:17:12.711
Confirm, please.

01:17:14.255 --> 01:17:16.339
Scotty, drive systems
should be free now.

01:17:16.424 --> 01:17:17.590
Commander?

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:19.676
Ready to launch remote
communications drone

01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:23.263
with complete ships records,
including our present situation, sir.

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:24.889
Delay launching as long as possible.

01:17:24.974 --> 01:17:27.475
Our drone can't escape as long
as we're held in that tractor.

01:17:27.643 --> 01:17:28.643
<i>Aye.</i>

01:17:54.545 --> 01:17:57.839
Captain, a maximum phaser strike
directly at the beam

01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:59.966
might weaken it just enough
for us to break free.

01:18:00.051 --> 01:18:02.635
Break free to where, Commander?

01:18:03.262 --> 01:18:05.638
Any show of resistance
would be futile, Captain.

01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:07.640
We don't know that, Mr Spock.

01:18:08.768 --> 01:18:10.602
Why are you opposed to trying?

01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:07.575
Why bring us inside? Not to destroy us.
They could have done that outside.

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.536
They still can.

01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.329
Curiosity, Mr Decker.

01:19:13.165 --> 01:19:16.000
lnsatiable curiosity.

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:28.888
Captain, photic sonar readings
indicate the aperture is closing.

01:19:28.973 --> 01:19:30.682
We're trapped, sir.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.144
Reverse angle on the viewer, Captain.

01:19:58.878 --> 01:20:01.754
Tractor beam has released us, Captain.

01:20:01.881 --> 01:20:06.426
Confirmed. Vessel is floating free.
No forward momentum.

01:20:08.554 --> 01:20:11.181
-Viewer ahead.
-Viewer ahead, sir.

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:19.898
Manoeuvring thrusters, Mr Sulu.
Ahead one third.

01:20:19.982 --> 01:20:22.233
Thrusters ahead, one third.

01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:31.659
Let's take a look.
Full sensor scan, Mr Spock.

01:20:31.744 --> 01:20:33.995
They can't expect us
not to look them over now.

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:35.497
Now that we're
looking down their throat.

01:20:35.581 --> 01:20:37.957
Right. Now that we've got them
just where they want us.

01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:57.185
lt's closing up.

01:21:00.064 --> 01:21:02.106
Hold position.

01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:03.983
Thrusters at station-keeping, sir.

01:21:06.904 --> 01:21:08.947
Captain?

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:16.538
All our scans are being reflected back.
Sensors are useless.

01:21:17.164 --> 01:21:18.289
Damn!

01:21:26.632 --> 01:21:27.882
What do you make of all this?

01:21:27.967 --> 01:21:31.594
l believe the closed orifice
leads to another chamber.

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:34.430
Undoubtedly, part of
the vessel's inner mechanism.

01:21:35.057 --> 01:21:38.518

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.293
-Jim, what's going on?
-Tricorder.

01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:52.675
Who is V'Ger?

01:22:53.802 --> 01:22:56.554
V'Ger is that which programmed me.

01:22:57.723 --> 01:23:01.559
ls V'Ger the name of
the captain of the alien vessel?

01:23:02.061 --> 01:23:07.023
-Jim, this is a mechanism.
-A probe, Captain.

01:23:09.026 --> 01:23:11.402
No doubt a sensor-transceiver
combination

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:14.030
recording everything we say and do.

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:19.202
-Where is Lieutenant llia?
-That unit no longer functions.

01:23:19.286 --> 01:23:22.246
l've been given its form
to more readily communicate

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:26.292
with the carbon-based units
infesting Enterprise.

01:23:26.377 --> 01:23:31.214
-Carbon-based units?
-Humans, Ensign Perez. Us.

01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:35.843
Why does V'Ger travel
to the third planet

01:23:35.928 --> 01:23:38.388
of the solar system directly ahead?

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:40.390
To find the Creator.

01:23:40.516 --> 01:23:45.478
Find the Creator? Whose...

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.693
What does V'Ger want
with the Creator?

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:53.361
To join with him.

01:23:53.445 --> 01:23:56.239
To join with the Creator? How?

01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:59.450
V'Ger and the Creator will become one.

01:23:59.576 --> 01:24:01.244
And who is the Creator?

01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:04.122
The Creator is that
which created V'Ger.

01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:08.167
-Who is V'Ger?
-V'Ger is that which seeks the Creator.

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:14.924
l'm ready to commence
my observations.

01:24:15.676 --> 01:24:19.262
Doctor, a thorough examination of
this probe might provide some insight

01:24:19.346 --> 01:24:23.057
into those who manufactured it
and how to deal with them.

01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:26.310
Fine. Let's get her to sickbay.

01:24:30.315 --> 01:24:32.650
l am programmed to observe and record

01:24:32.735 --> 01:24:35.319
only the normal functioning
of the carbon-based units.

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:39.449
The examination is a normal function.

01:24:42.703 --> 01:24:44.328
You may proceed.

01:24:50.586 --> 01:24:52.503
Micro-miniature hydraulics,

01:24:56.008 --> 01:24:57.300
sensors

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.682
and molecule-sized
multi-processor chips.

01:25:10.022 --> 01:25:11.731
And take a look at this.

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:14.609
An osmotic micro-pump right here.

01:25:14.943 --> 01:25:17.987
And even the smallest body functions
are exactly duplicated.

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:23.618
Every exocrine system is the same, too.

01:25:25.162 --> 01:25:26.996
Even eye moisture.

01:25:27.831 --> 01:25:29.207
Decker.

01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:33.711
Fascinating. Not "Decker-unit"?

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:39.759
Gentlemen.

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.136
Will.

01:25:53.023 --> 01:25:54.232
What happened to her?

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:57.819
Captain, this probe may be
our key to the aliens.

01:25:57.903 --> 01:25:59.737
Probe? "llia"?

01:25:59.822 --> 01:26:03.199
Exactly. lt is a programmed
mechanism, Commander.

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:06.994
lts body duplicates our
navigator in precise detail.

01:26:07.079 --> 01:26:09.205
Suppose that beneath its programming,

01:26:09.289 --> 01:26:13.334
the real llia's memory patterns are
duplicated with equal precision.

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:15.962
-They had a pattern to follow.
-lndeed.

01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:18.256
They may have followed it
too precisely.

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:21.676
llia's memory, her feelings of loyalty,

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:26.138
obedience, friendship
might all be there!

01:26:26.265 --> 01:26:30.226
You did have a relationship
with Lieutenant llia, Commander.

01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:32.895
That probe, in another form,
is what killed llia!

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.605
Commander!

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:36.148
Will,

01:26:36.275 --> 01:26:38.943
we're locked in an alien vessel,
six hours from Earth orbit.

01:26:39.069 --> 01:26:41.445
Our only contact with
our captor is that probe.

01:26:41.530 --> 01:26:44.699
lf we could control it,
persuade it, use it...

01:26:47.494 --> 01:26:51.622
l have recorded enough here.
You will now assist me further.

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:59.005
The Decker-unit can assist you
with much greater efficiency.

01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.846
Carry on with your assignment,
Mr Decker.

01:27:08.765 --> 01:27:10.016
Aye, sir.

01:27:14.521 --> 01:27:18.149
l am concerned with that being
our only source of information, Captain.

01:27:22.738 --> 01:27:25.656
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 7414.1 .</i>

01:27:26.408 --> 01:27:30.161
<i>Our best estimates place</i>
<i>us some four hours from Earth.</i>

01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:32.455
<i>No significant progress thus far,</i>

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:36.334
<i>reviving llia memory patterns</i>
<i>within the alien probe.</i>

01:27:36.418 --> 01:27:40.004
<i>This remains our only</i>
<i>means of contact with our captor.</i>

01:27:40.464 --> 01:27:42.673
<i>All those vessels</i>
were called Enterprise.

01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:57.855
The carbon units use this area
for recreation.

01:27:58.523 --> 01:28:00.524
This is one of the games.

01:28:05.197 --> 01:28:09.992
What types of recreation does
the crew aboard your vessel enjoy?

01:28:10.077 --> 01:28:14.455
The words "recreation" and "enjoy"

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:18.167
have no meaning to my programming.

01:28:26.385 --> 01:28:28.803
llia enjoyed this game.

01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:32.431
She nearly always won.

01:28:38.063 --> 01:28:41.399
Good. He's using
audio-visual association.

01:29:17.769 --> 01:29:19.603
This device serves no purpose.

01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:34.702
Why does Enterprise require
the presence of carbon units?

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:38.956
Enterprise would be unable to
function without carbon units.

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:43.210
More data concerning this
functioning is necessary,

01:29:43.295 --> 01:29:48.007
before carbon units can be
patterned for data storage.

01:29:51.428 --> 01:29:53.387
What does that mean?

01:29:53.472 --> 01:29:57.308
When my examination is
complete all carbon units

01:29:57.392 --> 01:30:00.436
will be reduced to data patterns.

01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:05.524
Within you are the memory
patterns of a certain carbon unit.

01:30:05.609 --> 01:30:08.235
lf l can help you
to revive those patterns,

01:30:08.945 --> 01:30:11.072
you could understand
our functions better.

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:15.159
That is logical. You may proceed.

01:31:01.248 --> 01:31:05.876
l remember Lieutenant llia
once mentioning she wore that.

01:31:10.549 --> 01:31:13.801
On Delta. Remember?

01:31:14.594 --> 01:31:16.554
llia?

01:31:22.394 --> 01:31:24.311
Doctor Chapel.

01:31:34.239 --> 01:31:38.075
-Will?
-llia.

01:31:39.911 --> 01:31:43.581
Commander. Commander.

01:31:46.543 --> 01:31:48.919
This is a mechanism.

01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:53.591
llia,

01:31:55.093 --> 01:31:59.513
help us make direct contact with V'Ger.

01:31:59.598 --> 01:32:04.101
-l cannot.
-This Creator V'Ger is looking for,

01:32:05.645 --> 01:32:09.732
-what is it?
-V'Ger does not know.

01:32:38.220 --> 01:32:40.262
Computer, commence recording.

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:46.810
Captain Kirk, these messages will detail
my attempt to contact the aliens.

01:32:54.444 --> 01:32:59.740
<i>Warning! Your emergency evacuation</i>
<i>thruster pack has been armed.</i>

01:32:59.824 --> 01:33:04.662
<i>Once ignited, the burn duration is</i>
<i>10 seconds and may not be aborted.</i>

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:09.583
<i>Push the igniter-enable release</i>
<i>to begin a 10-second countdown</i>

01:33:09.668 --> 01:33:11.335
<i>to thruster ignition.</i>

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:16.006
<i>To abort countdown,</i>
<i>flip the control arm up.</i>

01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:19.009
l intend to calculate thruster
ignition and acceleration rate

01:33:19.094 --> 01:33:21.762
to coincide with the opening
of the V'Ger orifice.

01:33:21.846 --> 01:33:25.808
This should facilitate a better view
of the interior of the alien spacecraft.

01:33:31.564 --> 01:33:35.150
Captain? Starfleet signals are
growing in strength, sir.

01:33:35.235 --> 01:33:38.988
They still have the intruder
on their monitors. lt's decelerating.

01:33:39.072 --> 01:33:43.659
Confirmed, sir. Lunar beacons indicate
intruder on a course into Earth orbit.

01:33:43.743 --> 01:33:49.540
Sir, airlock four has been opened.
A thruster suit is reported missing.

01:33:51.543 --> 01:33:55.004
A thruster suit?

01:33:55.088 --> 01:33:58.173
That's Spock. Damn him.

01:33:59.092 --> 01:34:01.635
Bring him back here. No, wait!

01:34:09.436 --> 01:34:12.146
-Get a fix on his position.
-Aye, sir!

01:35:29.849 --> 01:35:33.769
l have successfully penetrated
the next chamber of the alien's interior,

01:35:33.853 --> 01:35:36.814
and l'm witnessing some sort of
dimensional image,

01:35:36.898 --> 01:35:40.401
which l believe to be a representation
of V'Ger's home planet.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.036
l'm passing through
a connecting tunnel.

01:35:51.121 --> 01:35:54.832
Apparently, a kind of
plasma energy conduit,

01:35:54.916 --> 01:35:58.168
possibly a field coil
for a gigantic imaging system.

01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:14.101
Curious. l'm seeing images of planets,
moons, stars,

01:36:14.185 --> 01:36:17.062
whole galaxies,
all stored here, recorded.

01:36:17.147 --> 01:36:19.940
lt could be a representation
of V'Ger's entire journey.

01:36:25.697 --> 01:36:29.783
But who or what are we dealing with?

01:36:29.868 --> 01:36:33.579
The Epsilon lX station,
stored here with every detail.

01:36:41.796 --> 01:36:45.549
Captain, l am now quite convinced
that all of this is V'Ger.

01:36:46.009 --> 01:36:49.136
That we are inside a living machine.

01:36:54.726 --> 01:36:55.726
llia!

01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:06.111
The sensor must contain some
special meaning.

01:37:09.782 --> 01:37:11.909
l must try to mind-meld with it.

01:38:05.171 --> 01:38:10.592
Spock! Spock! Spock!

01:38:26.609 --> 01:38:30.487
Now scanning pons area
at spinal nerve fibre connection.

01:38:34.367 --> 01:38:37.578
lndications of some
neurological trauma.

01:38:38.663 --> 01:38:41.873
The power pouring through that
mind-meld must have been staggering.

01:38:49.674 --> 01:38:51.883
-Spock.
-Jim,

01:38:55.138 --> 01:38:57.347
l should have known.

01:38:57.432 --> 01:39:00.350
Were you right? About V'Ger?

01:39:01.936 --> 01:39:03.687
A life form of its own.

01:39:04.981 --> 01:39:09.401
-A conscious, living entity.
-A living machine?

01:39:09.485 --> 01:39:10.944
lt considers the Enterprise
a living machine.

01:39:11.029 --> 01:39:13.780
That's why the probe
refers to our ship as an entity.

01:39:13.865 --> 01:39:16.700
l saw V'Ger's planet,

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:20.454
a planet populated by living machines.

01:39:20.538 --> 01:39:23.040
Unbelievable technology.

01:39:25.084 --> 01:39:28.003
V'Ger has knowledge
that spans this universe.

01:39:30.048 --> 01:39:33.717
And yet, with all its pure logic,

01:39:35.303 --> 01:39:38.972
V'Ger is barren, cold.

01:39:39.057 --> 01:39:43.435
No mystery. No beauty.

01:39:47.023 --> 01:39:49.733
l should've known.

01:39:51.486 --> 01:39:56.239
Known? Known what? Spock.

01:39:56.324 --> 01:39:58.241
-Captain.
-Bones!

01:40:02.538 --> 01:40:08.085
Spock! What should you have known?
What should you have known?

01:40:13.174 --> 01:40:14.633
Jim,

01:40:18.763 --> 01:40:22.349
this simple feeling

01:40:24.102 --> 01:40:26.353
is beyond V'Ger's comprehension.

01:40:35.154 --> 01:40:37.781
No meaning. No hope.

01:40:39.283 --> 01:40:43.245
And Jim, no answers.

01:40:45.456 --> 01:40:48.291
-lt's asking questions.
-What questions?

01:40:48.835 --> 01:40:52.462
"ls this all that l am?"

01:40:53.965 --> 01:40:55.882
"ls there nothing more?"

01:41:01.931 --> 01:41:03.849
<i>Bridge to Captain.</i>

01:41:07.437 --> 01:41:08.562
Kirk here.

01:41:08.646 --> 01:41:10.647
A faint signal from Starfleet, sir.

01:41:11.357 --> 01:41:14.067
lntruder cloud has been
located on their outer monitors

01:41:14.152 --> 01:41:16.194
for the past 27 minutes.

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:19.239
Cloud dissipating rapidly
as it approaches.

01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:23.243
Starfleet reports forward velocity
has slowed to sub-warp speed.

01:41:23.745 --> 01:41:27.497
-We are three minutes from Earth orbit.
-l'll be right there.

01:41:31.836 --> 01:41:33.920
l need Spock on the bridge.

01:41:34.005 --> 01:41:36.131
Dalaphaline, five cc's.

01:41:37.842 --> 01:41:42.512
A machine planet
sending a machine to Earth,

01:41:44.682 --> 01:41:46.600
looking for its Creator.

01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:51.688
lt's absolutely incredible.

01:41:56.194 --> 01:41:58.945
Mr Chekov,
Commander Decker's present location?

01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:01.072
<i>He... They are in engineering, sir.</i>

01:42:11.209 --> 01:42:14.669
Captain, Starfleet is sending
this tactical on V'Ger's position.

01:42:16.714 --> 01:42:19.674
V'Ger is transmitting a signal.

01:42:22.220 --> 01:42:25.305
-Jim.
-From V'Ger.

01:42:29.936 --> 01:42:32.562
V'Ger signals the Creator.

01:42:47.328 --> 01:42:48.328
Spock?

01:42:49.664 --> 01:42:54.417
A simple binary code
transmitted by carrier wave signal.

01:42:56.254 --> 01:42:57.254
Radio.

01:42:59.715 --> 01:43:00.882
Radio?

01:43:06.180 --> 01:43:10.267
Jim, V'Ger expects an answer.

01:43:11.561 --> 01:43:14.312
An answer? l don't know the question.

01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:17.983
The Creator has not responded.

01:43:32.623 --> 01:43:36.126
All planetary defence systems
have just gone inoperative!

01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:20.295
Sir, Starfleet computes the devices
are proceeding

01:44:20.379 --> 01:44:23.465
toward equidistant positions,
orbiting the planet.

01:44:23.549 --> 01:44:25.383
They're the same things that hit us.

01:44:25.468 --> 01:44:28.094
They are hundreds of times
more powerful, Captain.

01:44:28.179 --> 01:44:29.429
From those positions,

01:44:29.513 --> 01:44:32.182
they could devastate
the entire surface of the planet.

01:44:45.404 --> 01:44:49.783
-Why?
-The Creator has not answered.

01:44:49.867 --> 01:44:53.745
The carbon-unit infestation is to be
removed from the Creator's planet.

01:44:53.829 --> 01:44:57.457
-Why?
-You infest Enterprise.

01:44:57.541 --> 01:45:00.293
You interfere with the Creator
in the same manner.

01:45:02.755 --> 01:45:03.755
Machine.

01:45:07.551 --> 01:45:10.261
V'Ger. V'Ger!

01:45:21.399 --> 01:45:22.816
Captain.

01:45:27.405 --> 01:45:29.781
V'Ger is a child.

01:45:30.992 --> 01:45:33.076
l suggest you treat her as such.

01:45:33.244 --> 01:45:35.787
-A child?
-Yes, Captain. A child.

01:45:36.664 --> 01:45:39.958
Evolving, learning, searching,

01:45:41.085 --> 01:45:42.585
instinctively needing.

01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:44.629
Needing what?

01:45:45.006 --> 01:45:49.509
Spock, this child is about to
wipe out every living thing on Earth.

01:45:50.469 --> 01:45:53.221
Now what do you suggest we do?
Spank it?

01:45:56.809 --> 01:46:00.145
lt knows only that it needs, Commander,

01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:04.941
but like so many of us,
it does not know what.

01:46:18.372 --> 01:46:21.833
The carbon units know why
the Creator has not responded.

01:46:25.337 --> 01:46:27.547
Disclose the information.

01:46:27.631 --> 01:46:31.468
Not until V'Ger withdraws
the devices orbiting the third planet!

01:46:31.552 --> 01:46:32.594
Captain!

01:46:35.598 --> 01:46:38.683
l'm losing Starfleet!
lnterference from V'Ger!

01:46:39.977 --> 01:46:44.022
Kirk-unit, disclose the information.

01:46:44.106 --> 01:46:47.108
Why has the Creator not responded?

01:46:47.693 --> 01:46:48.693
No.

01:46:52.782 --> 01:46:55.575
Secure all stations. Clear the bridge.

01:46:59.163 --> 01:47:00.663
Clear the bridge, Captain?

01:47:01.290 --> 01:47:03.208
That was the order, Mr Sulu.
Clear the bridge!

01:47:03.292 --> 01:47:04.334
Aye, sir.

01:47:11.509 --> 01:47:14.928
Your child is having a tantrum,
Mr Spock.

01:47:16.764 --> 01:47:19.015
V'Ger requires the information.

01:47:22.686 --> 01:47:25.271
Bridge! Secure all stations! Move out!

01:47:25.356 --> 01:47:27.565
Jim, what the hell kind of
strategy is this?

01:47:29.235 --> 01:47:31.694
All ship's functions
going to automatic, Captain.

01:47:31.779 --> 01:47:33.113
lf V'Ger destroys the Enterprise,

01:47:33.197 --> 01:47:35.990
the information that V'Ger
requires will also be destroyed!

01:47:36.075 --> 01:47:40.120
lt is illogical to withhold
required information.

01:47:40.204 --> 01:47:43.248
Kirk-unit! Kirk-unit.

01:47:46.544 --> 01:47:49.254
Why do you not disclose information?

01:47:53.050 --> 01:47:56.386
Because V'Ger's going to destroy
all the carbon units on the third planet.

01:47:56.470 --> 01:48:00.431
-They have repressed the Creator.
-The information will not be disclosed!

01:48:01.892 --> 01:48:04.352
V'Ger needs the information.

01:48:04.436 --> 01:48:08.314
Then V'Ger must withdraw
all the orbiting devices.

01:48:09.900 --> 01:48:14.737
V'Ger will comply, if the carbon units
will disclose the information.

01:48:21.370 --> 01:48:23.371
lt learns fast, doesn't it?

01:48:23.539 --> 01:48:26.833
Captain, the vessel, V'Ger,

01:48:26.917 --> 01:48:30.003
obviously operates from
a central brain complex.

01:48:30.963 --> 01:48:33.631
The orbiting devices would be
controlled from that point then?

01:48:33.716 --> 01:48:35.258
Precisely.

01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:48.730
The carbon unit's information
cannot be disclosed to V'Ger's probe,

01:48:49.273 --> 01:48:51.774
but only to V'Ger directly.

01:49:15.466 --> 01:49:18.343
-Forward motion, Captain.
-Tractor beam.

01:49:36.111 --> 01:49:38.863
Captain, what's the next move?

01:49:40.824 --> 01:49:44.077
The question is, Mr Decker,
is there a next move?

01:49:47.957 --> 01:49:49.290
Resume duty stations.

01:49:50.834 --> 01:49:52.794
All personnel, resume stations!

01:49:58.133 --> 01:50:01.928
Well, Mr Decker, it seems
my bluff has been called.

01:50:04.348 --> 01:50:06.766
l'm afraid our hand
is pretty weak, Captain.

01:50:11.355 --> 01:50:14.524
Mr Chekov, when do those devices
reach final position?

01:50:15.401 --> 01:50:18.653
Twenty-seven minutes. Mark!

01:50:24.410 --> 01:50:27.036
Captain, l believe that is our destination.

01:50:34.211 --> 01:50:36.379
Forward motion, slowing, Captain.

01:50:39.717 --> 01:50:44.429
l read an oxygen-gravity envelope
forming outside the Enterprise.

01:50:52.271 --> 01:50:54.188
Forward motion, stopped, Captain.

01:50:58.694 --> 01:51:00.320
V'Ger.

01:51:00.404 --> 01:51:04.365
Sir, l've located the source
of V'Ger's radio signal.

01:51:04.450 --> 01:51:06.159
lt's directly ahead.

01:51:06.243 --> 01:51:09.912
That transmitter is a vital link
between V'Ger and its Creator.

01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:19.005
The carbon units will now provide V'Ger
with the required information.

01:51:25.721 --> 01:51:28.473
Mr Spock? Bones?

01:51:31.852 --> 01:51:35.772
Mr Decker, l will contact you
every five minutes.

01:51:39.443 --> 01:51:41.611
Captain, l'd like to go along.

01:51:44.907 --> 01:51:47.116
Mr Sulu, you have the conn.

01:53:41.523 --> 01:53:42.815
V'Ger.

01:54:55.180 --> 01:54:58.683
V-G-E-R.

01:55:01.687 --> 01:55:02.687
V'Ger.

01:55:16.660 --> 01:55:20.079
V-O-Y-A-G-E-R.

01:55:20.163 --> 01:55:21.372
Voyager!

01:55:25.502 --> 01:55:27.420
<i>Voyager Vl!</i>

01:55:27.504 --> 01:55:29.130
NASA.

01:55:29.214 --> 01:55:32.008
National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

01:55:32.092 --> 01:55:36.345
Jim, this was launched
more than 300 years ago.

01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:41.684
Voyager series,

01:55:43.979 --> 01:55:45.605
designed to collect data

01:55:48.442 --> 01:55:50.192
and transmit it back to Earth.

01:56:32.486 --> 01:56:39.450
Captain, Voyager Vl disappeared into
what they used to call a black hole.

01:56:39.826 --> 01:56:43.496
lt must have emerged on
the far side of the galaxy

01:56:43.580 --> 01:56:46.707
and fell into the machine planet's
gravitational field.

01:56:46.792 --> 01:56:50.294
The machine inhabitants found
it to be one of their own kind.

01:56:50.379 --> 01:56:52.963
Primitive, yet kindred.

01:56:53.048 --> 01:56:56.342
They discovered its simple
20th-century programming.

01:56:56.426 --> 01:56:59.595
"Collect all data possible."

01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:01.305
"Learn all that is learnable."

01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:08.729
-Return that information to its Creator.
-Precisely, Mr Decker.

01:57:08.814 --> 01:57:12.858
The machines interpreted it literally.
They built this entire vessel

01:57:12.943 --> 01:57:15.861
so that Voyagercould actually fulfil
its programming.

01:57:16.905 --> 01:57:18.364
And on its journey back,

01:57:20.992 --> 01:57:23.119
it amassed so much knowledge,

01:57:24.705 --> 01:57:26.956
it achieved consciousness itself.

01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:30.459
lt became a living thing.

01:57:45.434 --> 01:57:49.145
Kirk-unit. V'Ger awaits the information.

01:57:51.148 --> 01:57:55.693
Enterprise, order up
the ship's computer library of records

01:57:55.777 --> 01:57:59.321
on the late 20th century
NASA probe, Voyager Vl.

01:57:59.406 --> 01:58:02.283
<i>Specifically,</i>
<i>we want the old NASA code signal</i>

01:58:02.367 --> 01:58:04.744
<i>that instructs the</i>
<i>probe to transmit its data.</i>

01:58:04.828 --> 01:58:07.079
-And fast, Uhura, fast!
<i>-Aye, sir.</i>

01:58:07.164 --> 01:58:11.459
That's what it's been signalling!
lts readiness to transmit its information!

01:58:11.543 --> 01:58:13.002
And there's no one on Earth

01:58:13.086 --> 01:58:15.713
who could recognise the old signal
and send a response.

01:58:15.797 --> 01:58:17.673
"The Creator does not answer."

01:58:28.435 --> 01:58:37.234
V'Ger.

01:58:39.321 --> 01:58:40.321
V'Ger!

01:58:45.285 --> 01:58:48.287
We are the Creator.

01:58:48.371 --> 01:58:52.374
That is not logical.
Carbon units are not true life forms.

01:58:52.459 --> 01:58:54.627
We will prove it.
We will make it possible

01:58:54.711 --> 01:58:57.671
for you to complete your programming.

01:58:57.756 --> 01:59:00.049
Only the Creator could accomplish that.

01:59:02.469 --> 01:59:03.803
<i>Enterprise.</i>

01:59:03.887 --> 01:59:06.722
We have just received the
response code, Captain.

01:59:06.807 --> 01:59:09.141
Set the Enterprise transmitter
on appropriate frequency

01:59:09.226 --> 01:59:11.644
and transmit the code now!

01:59:11.728 --> 01:59:14.063
<i>Transmitting.</i>

01:59:14.147 --> 01:59:19.026
5-0-4, 3-2-9,

01:59:19.110 --> 01:59:23.823
3-1 -7, 5-1 -0,

01:59:23.907 --> 01:59:25.991
and the final sequence...

01:59:26.076 --> 01:59:28.410
That should trigger
Voyager's transmitter.

01:59:41.258 --> 01:59:43.926
Voyager is not transmitting
its data, Captain.

01:59:46.096 --> 01:59:48.222
The Creator must join with V'Ger.

01:59:51.184 --> 01:59:53.435
Uhura! Repeat the final sequence.

01:59:58.358 --> 02:00:00.609
The Creator must join with V'Ger.

02:00:21.965 --> 02:00:24.091
Voyager is not transmitting, Captain,

02:00:24.175 --> 02:00:27.136
because it did not receive
the final sequence.

02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:29.889
Jim! We're down to 1 0 minutes.

02:00:29.973 --> 02:00:31.557
Enterprise, stand by.

02:00:40.525 --> 02:00:44.069
-The antenna leads are melted away.
-Yes, Captain, just now.

02:00:44.154 --> 02:00:47.781
-By V'Ger itself.
-Why?

02:00:47.866 --> 02:00:49.867
To prevent reception.

02:00:49.951 --> 02:00:56.457
Of course, to bring the Creator here
to finish transmitting the code in person.

02:01:00.754 --> 02:01:03.005
To touch the Creator.

02:01:04.674 --> 02:01:07.051
Capture God?

02:01:07.135 --> 02:01:09.970
V'Ger's liable to be in for one hell
of a disappointment.

02:01:10.055 --> 02:01:11.555
Perhaps not, Doctor.

02:01:35.080 --> 02:01:36.372
Captain.

02:01:43.421 --> 02:01:45.005
V'Ger must evolve.

02:01:45.090 --> 02:01:47.466
lts knowledge has reached
the limits of this universe

02:01:47.550 --> 02:01:49.218
and it must evolve.

02:01:49.302 --> 02:01:52.554
What it requires of its God, Doctor,
is the answer to its question,

02:01:52.639 --> 02:01:54.139
"ls there nothing more?"

02:01:54.224 --> 02:01:56.892
What more is there
than the universe, Spock?

02:01:56.977 --> 02:01:58.978
Other dimensions,
higher levels of being.

02:01:59.062 --> 02:02:01.647
The existence of which cannot
be proven logically.

02:02:01.731 --> 02:02:04.984
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable
of believing in them.

02:02:05.068 --> 02:02:09.905
What V'Ger needs in order to evolve
is a human quality,

02:02:09.990 --> 02:02:11.824
our capacity to leap beyond logic.

02:02:16.454 --> 02:02:18.998
And joining with its Creator
might accomplish that.

02:02:19.082 --> 02:02:23.043
You mean, this machine wants
to physically join with a human?

02:02:23.128 --> 02:02:24.586
ls that possible?

02:02:28.299 --> 02:02:29.633
Let's find out.

02:02:38.768 --> 02:02:41.228
-Decker!
-l'm going to key the final sequence

02:02:41.312 --> 02:02:42.521
through the ground test computer.

02:02:42.605 --> 02:02:45.190
Decker, you don't know what
that'll do to you!

02:02:45.275 --> 02:02:46.608
Yes, l do, Doctor!

02:02:53.616 --> 02:02:54.825
Decker, don't!

02:02:54.909 --> 02:02:57.619
Jim, l want this.

02:02:57.704 --> 02:03:01.373
As much as you wanted the Enterprise,
l want this.

02:05:55.131 --> 02:05:56.340
Captain.

02:05:58.134 --> 02:06:02.721
Spock, did we just see
the beginning of a new life form?

02:06:02.805 --> 02:06:06.058
Yes, Captain. We witnessed a birth.

02:06:06.142 --> 02:06:10.562
-Possibly, a next step in our evolution.
-l wonder.

02:06:10.647 --> 02:06:13.482
Well, it's been a long time
since l delivered a baby,

02:06:13.566 --> 02:06:15.776
and l hope we got this one off
to a good start.

02:06:15.860 --> 02:06:18.362
l hope so, too.

02:06:18.446 --> 02:06:23.951
l think we gave it the ability to create
its own sense of purpose

02:06:24.035 --> 02:06:26.245
out of our own human weaknesses

02:06:27.789 --> 02:06:30.374
and the drive that compels us
to overcome.

02:06:30.458 --> 02:06:34.253
And a lot of foolish human
emotions, right, Mr Spock?

02:06:34.337 --> 02:06:35.963
Quite true, Doctor.

02:06:36.047 --> 02:06:39.925
Unfortunately, it will have to
deal with them as well.

02:06:40.009 --> 02:06:41.760
lnterrogative from Starfleet.

02:06:41.844 --> 02:06:43.720
They're requesting damage
and injury reports

02:06:43.805 --> 02:06:45.389
and complete vessel status.

02:06:45.473 --> 02:06:47.766
Report two casualties.

02:06:47.850 --> 02:06:51.770
Lieutenant llia. Captain Decker.

02:06:52.397 --> 02:06:55.482
-Aye, sir.
-Correction. They're not casualties.

02:06:55.984 --> 02:06:57.484
They are...

02:07:00.530 --> 02:07:01.947
List them as missing.

02:07:03.199 --> 02:07:06.034
-Vessel status, fully operational.
-Aye, sir.

02:07:07.370 --> 02:07:08.704
Mr Scott!

02:07:09.539 --> 02:07:12.374
Shall we give the Enterprise
a proper shakedown?

02:07:12.625 --> 02:07:15.460
l would say it's time for that, sir. Aye.

02:07:15.545 --> 02:07:18.380
We can have you back on Vulcan
in four days, Mr Spock.

02:07:18.673 --> 02:07:23.385
Unnecessary, Mr Scott.
My task on Vulcan is completed.

02:07:24.887 --> 02:07:28.140
-Mr Sulu, ahead warp 1 .
-Warp 1 , sir.

02:07:28.599 --> 02:07:29.766
Heading, sir?

02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:35.188
Out there.
