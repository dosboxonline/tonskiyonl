14:20.493 --> 14:21.561
Okay, so push the press.

14:21.728 --> 14:22.629
[Hollar]
Press is resisting.

14:22.729 --> 14:23.997
They're resisting.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.967
They're resisting
to cover the kidnapping

14:27.067 --> 14:28.735
of a United States congresswoman

14:28.902 --> 14:31.304
and the murder of her family
on U.S. soil.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.740
The rescue is polling
as overreach.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.576
Mexico is,
understandably, outraged.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.877
I'm a little outraged myself.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.047
[Mason] Look, this thing
is dividing on party lines.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.082
This would be a lot simpler
if she had been--

14:42.215 --> 14:43.216
[Westfield]
If she had what?

14:43.350 --> 14:44.817
- Been a Democrat?
- [Meade] We can arrange

14:44.918 --> 14:46.086
the kidnapping of a Democrat

14:46.219 --> 14:47.754
if, uh, that would be helpful.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.022
You think that's funny?

14:49.122 --> 14:50.090
[Meade]
I think it's tragic.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.925
I think it's a dereliction
of duty

14:52.059 --> 14:53.560
that borders on treason that...

14:53.693 --> 14:56.196
that Congress refuses to act in
the best interest of this nation

14:56.329 --> 14:57.464
because... because they're
more concerned

14:57.630 --> 14:58.631
with the next election.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.067
[Mason]
That's easy for you to say.

15:00.200 --> 15:01.768
You were appointed
to your position.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.803
[Westfield]
And you were appointed to yours.

15:03.937 --> 15:06.439
So was everyone
in this fucking room.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.808
Now, what you need to do
is get out of this room,

15:08.942 --> 15:11.278
go to the Capitol and start
pulling heads out of asses.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.251
President's polling
right around 40%.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.320
We are fucking paralyzed.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.889
We need more support
from our side of the aisle--

15:22.990 --> 15:24.191
This is not a kidnapping.

15:24.291 --> 15:25.825
I hope everyone here
understands that.

15:25.993 --> 15:27.060
[Mullins]
Well, it sure looked

15:27.194 --> 15:28.561
like a kidnapping to me.

15:28.695 --> 15:29.629
It's a probe.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.763
[Mason]
A probe.

15:30.897 --> 15:32.899
Explain what you mean
by a probe.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.301
Do you mean it's a false flag?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.469
It is an act
to study our reaction

15:36.603 --> 15:39.939
and the public's sentiment
toward whatever action we take.

15:40.073 --> 15:43.310
She was held for almost 24 hours
just south of the border.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.678
That's enough time
for us to formulate a plan

15:45.845 --> 15:47.747
and move a QRF into place.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.682
The victim wasn't stripped
and searched

15:49.816 --> 15:51.651
for electronics
or tracking systems.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.153
[Meade] A legitimate
attempt to secure her

15:53.286 --> 15:55.655
would've involved
a thorough search

15:55.788 --> 15:58.591
and immediate removal
to the interior of Mexico

15:58.691 --> 16:00.293
in a large urban area

16:00.427 --> 16:02.262
where we would have
no ability to provide

16:02.362 --> 16:04.497
air or ground support to QRF,
and we would have to

16:04.631 --> 16:07.000
enter the nation
through commercial means,

16:07.167 --> 16:09.669
with a greatly compromised
tactical capacity.

16:09.836 --> 16:11.871
This was a test case

16:12.039 --> 16:14.074
that they're gonna base
their next operation around.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.909
[Mason] Our intel sees this
more as a psyop

16:17.010 --> 16:19.179
meant to further divide
the parties of Congress,

16:19.346 --> 16:22.015
which is certainly the effect
it is having.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.616
You're wrong.
Your intel's wrong.

16:23.750 --> 16:27.120
You are wrong. Their mission
is the next mission.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.755
This was the USS <i>Cole.</i>

16:28.855 --> 16:31.691
Our lack of response to that
was the green light to 9/11.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.593
That is what this is.

16:34.861 --> 16:36.763
Even if you're right,

16:36.863 --> 16:38.365
they're not gonna believe.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.466
They will believe it
from us, sir.

16:39.599 --> 16:40.633
- You think?
- [Westfield] I do.

16:40.733 --> 16:42.535
Who is holding up
the votes in the Senate?

16:42.669 --> 16:43.870
Albright and Fuller, to start.

16:44.037 --> 16:45.072

Yeah.

you got Fuller.
