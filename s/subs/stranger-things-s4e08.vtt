Um, as long as
Suzie's coordinates are right,

14:52.308 --> 14:54.101
about another 90 miles. Why?

14:54.184 --> 14:57.646
Well, once we save her, El,
we should stop on the way back.

14:57.730 --> 15:01.191
El could make us, like, super rich,
and we'd never have to work.

15:01.275 --> 15:05.029
We could just play D&D and Nintendo
for the rest of our lives.

15:05.112 --> 15:06.822
Yeah. Totally.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.578

after all this is over, she…

15:20.002 --> 15:21.629
sh… she doesn't need me anymore?

15:21.712 --> 15:23.505
No, o… of course she'll still need you.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.132
She'll always need you, Mike.

15:25.215 --> 15:26.926
I keep telling myself that, but I…

15:28.093 --> 15:29.303
I don't believe it.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.889
I mean, she's special.

15:32.389 --> 15:33.474
She was born special.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.143
Maybe I was one of the first people
to realize that.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.480
But the truth is,
when I stumbled on her in the woods,

15:39.563 --> 15:40.981
she just needed someone.

15:41.065 --> 15:44.568
It's not fate. It's… It's not destiny.
It's just simple dumb luck.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.279
And one day she's gonna realize
I'm just some random nerd

15:47.363 --> 15:49.448
that got lucky
that Superman landed on his doorstep.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.408
I mean, at least Lois Lane

-No.

No, i… it's so stupid,
given everything that's going on.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.753
It's just… I… I don't know, I just…

16:03.087 --> 16:04.046
Uh…

16:04.129 --> 16:05.631
You're scared of losing her.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.704
Yeah. Yeah. I mean…

16:36.787 --> 16:39.039
I mean… I mean, El asked me to.

16:39.123 --> 16:42.459
She commissioned it, basically.
I mean, she told me what to draw.

16:42.543 --> 16:44.253
Anyway, my point is,

16:45.212 --> 16:46.547
see how you're leading us here?

16:46.630 --> 16:48.841
You're guiding the whole party,
inspiring us.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.426
That… That's what you do.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.012
And see your coat of arms here?
It's a heart.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.555
And I know it's sort of on the nose,

16:54.638 --> 16:57.057
but that's what
holds this party together. Heart.

16:57.141 --> 17:01.145
Because, I mean,
without heart, we'd all fall apart.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.939
Even El. Especially El.

17:05.649 --> 17:10.195
These past few months,
she's been so lost without you.

17:10.279 --> 17:14.283
It's just, she's so different
from other people, and…

17:14.992 --> 17:17.953
[haltingly] …when you're…
when you're different,

17:18.037 --> 17:19.455
sometimes…

17:19.538 --> 17:21.999
[sighs] …you feel like a mistake.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.170
But you make her feel like
she's not a mistake at all.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.172
Like she's better for being different.

17:28.255 --> 17:29.882
And that gives her
the courage to fight on.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.467
If she was mean to you

17:31.550 --> 17:33.719
or she seemed like
she was pushing you away,

17:33.802 --> 17:36.805
it's because she's scared of losing you,
like you're scared of losing her.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.599
And if she was going to lose you,

17:38.682 --> 17:40.851
I… I think she'd rather just
get it over with quick.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.352
Like ripping off a Band-Aid.

17:43.687 --> 17:45.856
So, yeah, El needs you, Mike.

17:45.939 --> 17:47.441
And she always will.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.194
Yeah?

17:51.111 --> 17:51.945
Yeah.

18:26.563 --> 18:28.565
[mysterious music playing]

18:48.585 --> 18:50.879
[mysterious music intensifies]

18:54.967 --> 18:56.468
[Brenner] After the attack,

18:56.552 --> 18:57.845
you fell into a coma.

18:58.971 --> 19:02.391
Like One, you had pushed yourself
beyond your limit.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.853
And it very nearly destroyed you.

19:07.354 --> 19:09.523
But that is where your similarities ended.

19:10.023 --> 19:10.941
[garbled static]

19:11.024 --> 19:12.734
What you displayed that day

19:13.652 --> 19:15.571
was beyond anything I'd ever imagined.

19:15.654 --> 19:16.655
[One screaming]

19:16.738 --> 19:18.824
A potential I'd only dreamed of.

19:18.907 --> 19:20.617
[screaming continues]

19:24.872 --> 19:26.039
But when you awoke,

19:27.541 --> 19:28.959
something had been lost.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.128
Your memories,

19:31.670 --> 19:34.756
along with whatever else
you'd found within yourself that day.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.757
[monitor beeping]

19:35.841 --> 19:38.177
But I knew then, just as I knew today,

19:38.260 --> 19:40.262
that your powers had not been lost.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.015
They just needed a spark.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.308
[can crunches]

19:45.309 --> 19:46.435
But that day,

19:47.352 --> 19:49.021
you awakened something else.

19:49.104 --> 19:51.148
A doorway to another world.

19:51.231 --> 19:53.025
[building crumbling]

19:53.108 --> 19:54.776
[unsettling music playing]

19:54.860 --> 19:56.987
I always thought that Henry was out there,

19:57.696 --> 19:59.239
hiding in the darkness.

20:00.991 --> 20:04.203
I didn't know for sure,
not beyond a feeling.

20:05.954 --> 20:06.914
Until now.

20:09.291 --> 20:13.003
He's claimed three victims so far,
and when I saw the eyes,

20:13.795 --> 20:15.589
I knew… I knew that was him.

20:16.340 --> 20:19.676
He was sending us a message,
letting us know he's back.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.971
That's when I came to see you.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.017
[gasps softly]

20:28.936 --> 20:30.103
My friends.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.773
Well, we… we haven't risked contact,

20:32.856 --> 20:34.733
but, as far as we know,

20:34.816 --> 20:36.652
they're… they're all safe.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.947
But I'm not gonna lie to you, Eleven.

20:40.948 --> 20:42.449
Your friends are in terrible danger.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.952
With each victim he takes,

20:45.035 --> 20:45.953
Henry is…

20:47.246 --> 20:51.041
chiseling away at the barrier that exists
between our two worlds.

20:51.750 --> 20:52.751
"Chiseling"?

20:53.335 --> 20:54.836
[Brenner] Imagine, if you will,

20:54.920 --> 20:57.172
the barrier between our worlds is a…

20:58.006 --> 20:59.132
concrete dam.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.676
[menacing music playing]

21:00.759 --> 21:03.595
Henry is putting cracks in this dam.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.348
Cracks in dams

21:06.431 --> 21:07.599
create pressure.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.851
Left unchecked,

21:10.894 --> 21:12.354
the pressure will build.

21:13.063 --> 21:14.356
And build.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.025
And eventually,
it will reach a breaking point.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.653
And the dam will burst.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.071
[snap echoes]

21:21.154 --> 21:22.489
And when that happens,

21:23.782 --> 21:25.075
Hawkins will fall.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.618
[exhales]

21:31.873 --> 21:34.001
Well, that went very well, I thought.

21:34.084 --> 21:37.170
You eased her into it, nice and gentle,
just like we talked about.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.547
Not ominous at all.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.632
[introspective music playing]

21:44.094 --> 21:46.096
[breathing heavily]

21:47.931 --> 21:49.349
[slams loudly]

21:49.433 --> 21:51.393

-[Eleven sighs]

22:12.956 --> 22:14.374
[exhales]

22:20.756 --> 22:22.424
[Nancy, hoarsely] He showed me

22:23.216 --> 22:25.719
things that haven't happened yet.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.514
The most awful things.

22:33.143 --> 22:34.186
I saw

22:35.020 --> 22:36.521
a dark cloud

22:37.356 --> 22:39.107
spreading over Hawkins.

22:39.858 --> 22:41.693
Downtown on fire.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.488
Dead soldiers.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.657
And this…

22:49.159 --> 22:51.370
giant creature

22:52.162 --> 22:55.415
with… a gaping mouth.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.292
And this creature wasn't alone.

22:58.251 --> 23:00.420
There were so many monsters.

23:02.339 --> 23:03.340
An army.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.260
And they were coming into Hawkins.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.763
Into our neighborhoods.

23:11.264 --> 23:12.224
Our homes.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.101
And then…

23:16.186 --> 23:18.188
he showed me my mom.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.191
And Holly.

23:22.984 --> 23:23.860
Mike.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.154
And they…

23:28.365 --> 23:29.449
they were all…

23:31.493 --> 23:32.619
[breathes shakily]

23:34.746 --> 23:38.458
Okay, but… he's just trying
to scare you, Nance.

23:39.376 --> 23:40.377
Right? I mean…

23:41.670 --> 23:42.796
I mean, it's not real.

23:42.879 --> 23:43.922
Not yet.

23:46.174 --> 23:49.136
But there… there was something else.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.639
He showed me gates.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.182
[haunting music playing]

23:54.266 --> 23:55.809
Four gates.

23:56.977 --> 23:59.062
Spreading across Hawkins.

23:59.688 --> 24:03.859
And these gates, they looked like
the one outside of Eddie's trailer,

24:03.942 --> 24:06.528
but… they didn't stop growing.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.448
And this wasn't the Upside Down Hawkins.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.033
This was our Hawkins.

24:14.035 --> 24:14.953
Our home.

24:17.789 --> 24:18.999
[Max] Four chimes.

24:21.126 --> 24:21.960
Vecna's clock.

24:23.753 --> 24:25.422
It always chimes four times.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.507
[music pulses ominously]

24:27.591 --> 24:28.425
Four exactly.

24:29.759 --> 24:30.886
I heard them too.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.435
He's been telling us his plan
this whole time.

24:39.186 --> 24:40.479
Four kills.

24:41.771 --> 24:42.981
Four gates.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.069
End of the world.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.362
If that's true…

24:51.490 --> 24:52.866
he's only one kill away.

24:52.949 --> 24:55.785
Oh Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.245
Try 'em again. Try 'em again.

24:58.997 --> 24:59.998

-[Max] No.

25:12.052 --> 25:13.762
Rang a few times,
then went to busy signal.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.597
[Steve] Maybe you punched it wrong.
Try again.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.225
-[Max] I didn't punch it in wrong.
-[Steve] Well, I don't know.

25:18.308 --> 25:20.060
[Dustin] I think she knows
how to use a phone.

25:20.143 --> 25:22.395
[Steve] I'm just saying,
she could've typed it in wrong.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.314
[line ringing]

25:24.397 --> 25:25.732
[busy signal drones]

25:25.815 --> 25:28.109
-Same shit.
-[Lucas] How is that possible?

25:28.193 --> 25:30.862
Joyce has this telemarketer job.
Always on the phone.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.322
Mike won't stop whining about it.

25:32.405 --> 25:35.784
Yeah, but this phone's been busy
for, what, three days now?

25:36.284 --> 25:37.369
That's not Joyce.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.746
No way. Something's wrong.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.915
[Nancy] She's right.

25:41.998 --> 25:44.751
It can't be just coincidence. It can't be.

25:45.752 --> 25:49.172
Whatever's happening in Lenora
is connected to all of this.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.257
I'm sure of it.

25:53.134 --> 25:54.678
But Vecna can't hurt them.

25:56.805 --> 25:58.265
Not if he's dead.

25:58.348 --> 26:01.351
We have to go back in there.
Back to the Upside Down.

26:01.434 --> 26:03.186
-[Steve] Whoa, no, no, no. What?
-Nope.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.647
-Let's think this through.
-What is there to think through?

26:05.730 --> 26:08.525
-We barely made it out of there.
-Yeah, because we weren't prepared.

26:08.608 --> 26:11.945
But this time, we will be.
We'll get weapons and protection.

26:12.028 --> 26:15.073
We'll go through the gate,
we'll find his lair, and we'll kill him.

26:15.156 --> 26:16.366
Or he'll kill us.

26:16.449 --> 26:19.452
The only reason you survived
is because he wanted you to.

26:19.536 --> 26:22.205
-He's not scared of us.
-And for good reason.

26:22.289 --> 26:25.458
We were wrong about Vecna. Henry. One.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.960
Sorry, what are we calling him now?

26:27.043 --> 26:28.128
-[Dustin, Lucas] One.
-Vecna.

26:28.211 --> 26:29.421
-Henry.
-Right.

26:29.504 --> 26:31.965
We've learned something new
about Vecna/Henry/One.

26:32.048 --> 26:33.258
He's a number like Eleven,

26:33.341 --> 26:36.636
only a sick, evil, male, child-murdering
version of her with really bad skin.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.347
But my… my point is, he's super powerful.

26:39.431 --> 26:42.392
Could turn us inside out with a snap
of his fingers. It's not a fair fight.

26:42.475 --> 26:43.977
[Dustin] Then why fight fair?

26:44.060 --> 26:47.397
You're right. He's like Eleven.
But that gives us an upper hand.

26:47.480 --> 26:49.149
We know Eleven's strengths.

26:49.232 --> 26:51.276
And weaknesses.

26:51.359 --> 26:52.694
Weaknesses?

26:52.777 --> 26:54.237
When El remote-travels,

26:54.321 --> 26:58.033
she goes into
this sort of trance-like state.

26:58.116 --> 26:59.409
I bet the same is true of Vecna.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.620
That would explain
what he was doing in that attic.

27:01.703 --> 27:04.080
Exactly. When he attacks his next victim,

27:04.164 --> 27:07.626
I'll bet you he's back in that attic,
physical body defenseless.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.794
Defenseless? What about the army of bats?

27:09.878 --> 27:12.130
True. We'll have to find a way past them.

27:12.213 --> 27:13.423
Distract them somehow.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.967
-And, uh, how do we do that, exactly?
-No idea.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.761
But once they're gone,

27:17.844 --> 27:19.262
he doesn't stand a chance.

27:19.346 --> 27:22.307
It'll be like slaying sleeping Dracula
in his coffin.

27:22.390 --> 27:23.975
That all sounds good in theory,

27:24.059 --> 27:26.061
but there is no pattern
to Vecna's killings.

27:26.144 --> 27:27.646
Not one that I can decipher.

27:27.729 --> 27:29.814
We don't know
when he's going to attack next.

27:29.898 --> 27:32.692
-Don't even know who he's going to attack.
-Yeah, we do.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.778
I can still feel him.

27:34.861 --> 27:37.113
-[ominous audio distortion]
-I'm still marked.

27:38.448 --> 27:39.449
Cursed.

27:41.409 --> 27:42.661
I ditch Kate Bush,

27:43.578 --> 27:44.871
I draw his focus back to me.

27:44.954 --> 27:46.122
Max.

27:47.290 --> 27:48.208
You can't.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.126
He'll kill you.

27:50.710 --> 27:51.961
I survived before.

27:52.045 --> 27:54.464
[dire synth music playing]

27:54.547 --> 27:55.632
I can survive again.

27:57.092 --> 28:01.554
I just need to keep him busy long enough
so that you guys can get into that attic.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.057
Then you can chop his head off.

28:04.849 --> 28:08.144
Stab him in the heart. Blow him up
with some explosive Dustin cooks up.

28:08.228 --> 28:11.481
I honestly don't care
how you put this asshole in his grave.

55:30.702 --> 55:31.911
We just wanna talk.

55:33.413 --> 55:36.708
[music swells, fades]

[momentous music playing]

[door clangs]

56:12.619 --> 56:13.536
No! Wait!

56:14.162 --> 56:15.163
No! No!

56:15.747 --> 56:16.748
[door locks]

56:16.831 --> 56:18.917
[panting]

56:19.000 --> 56:19.876
What…

56:25.298 --> 56:27.008
[Brenner] You can't leave, Eleven.

56:27.092 --> 56:28.176
[distressing stinger]

56:33.306 --> 56:34.641
Where is Dr. Owens?

56:34.724 --> 56:36.726
Dr. Owens had a change of heart.

56:40.146 --> 56:41.648
I know you wish to go to him,

56:41.731 --> 56:44.359
and there's nothing I can do to stop you

56:44.442 --> 56:45.860
from forcing open that door.

56:47.070 --> 56:48.905
But if my men hear you coming,

56:49.781 --> 56:50.740
they will kill him.

56:50.824 --> 56:53.076
-[Owens grunts, strains]
-[handcuffs clicking]

56:54.494 --> 56:57.705
And alone, you will never find your way
out of this desert to your friends.

56:58.915 --> 57:00.583
Here's what we're going to do.

57:01.501 --> 57:04.963
You and I are going to complete
our work together.

57:06.214 --> 57:08.550
And when I decide that you are ready,

57:08.633 --> 57:11.594
we will return to Hawkins, together.

57:12.178 --> 57:13.847
Papa and daughter.

57:15.723 --> 57:18.476
[exhales] Why are you doing this?

57:19.227 --> 57:20.728
Because there's no other choice.

57:20.812 --> 57:22.021
There is a choice.

57:23.481 --> 57:24.899
Only one that is right.

57:26.443 --> 57:28.027
And you make the right choices?

57:28.736 --> 57:29.779
I try.

57:29.863 --> 57:32.198
Did you make the right choice with Mama?

57:32.282 --> 57:33.533
Four-fifty.

57:33.616 --> 57:34.492
[electricity hums]

57:37.370 --> 57:38.955
Your mother was sick, Eleven.

57:39.622 --> 57:41.458
She was a danger to herself and to others.

57:41.541 --> 57:44.294
She brought a gun into the hospital.
She killed a man.

57:44.377 --> 57:45.837
Hospital?

57:46.838 --> 57:47.672
No.

57:49.215 --> 57:50.300
A prison.

57:51.050 --> 57:53.970
Everything I have done
was for your own good.

57:54.053 --> 57:55.388
For your own protection.

57:56.139 --> 57:57.098
And Henry?

57:57.182 --> 57:58.475
[chilling music playing]

57:58.558 --> 58:01.144
You kept Henry in that lab.

58:01.227 --> 58:02.645
With the children.

58:02.729 --> 58:04.063
Was that for our good?

58:04.147 --> 58:05.857
Was that a right choice?

58:05.940 --> 58:08.485
I had no idea what Henry would do.

58:09.235 --> 58:10.487
I cared for you.

58:10.570 --> 58:12.697
I loved you. I loved all of you.

58:12.780 --> 58:13.781
Even Henry?

58:14.324 --> 58:15.158
Yes.

58:15.700 --> 58:19.204
I was trying to help Henry,
to understand him. Yes.

58:19.746 --> 58:21.498
Yes, I cared for him.

58:21.581 --> 58:25.126
Even after what… what he did?

58:25.793 --> 58:26.920
Yes.

58:27.003 --> 58:30.006
Because I knew I had failed him.

58:31.341 --> 58:32.592
So this morning,

58:33.343 --> 58:36.721
you said you believed
he was always alive in the darkness.

58:37.889 --> 58:40.391
Is that why I was searching the darkness?

58:41.768 --> 58:43.603
[eerie snarling]

58:45.188 --> 58:47.190
Was I looking for him? For Henry?

58:48.024 --> 58:49.859
No. No.

58:50.610 --> 58:52.779
We were focused on the Soviets.

58:52.862 --> 58:53.780
You knew that.

58:53.863 --> 58:55.949
"Papa does not tell the truth."

58:56.783 --> 58:58.034
Henry said that.

58:58.785 --> 59:00.787
And now you trust Henry?

59:02.121 --> 59:04.999
Henry, who's manipulated you
like some puppet?

59:06.793 --> 59:10.296
You are the one
who released him from his prison.

59:12.173 --> 59:13.007
You.

59:14.425 --> 59:16.344
And now you are angry with yourself

59:16.427 --> 59:18.429
and you're taking your anger out on me

59:18.513 --> 59:20.014
and you're risking everything.

59:20.098 --> 59:20.974
No.

59:21.474 --> 59:22.600
No, you.

59:24.227 --> 59:25.937
You have risked everything!

59:26.020 --> 59:27.063
You have lied!

59:27.146 --> 59:28.565
You made me look for him!

-[all screaming]
-[bones cracking]

59:45.915 --> 59:47.125
And all because of you.

59:47.208 --> 59:48.876
Because you could not stop.

59:48.960 --> 59:50.587
You could not let him go.

59:52.463 --> 59:55.883
I came here
to try and understand who I was.

59:58.386 --> 59:59.387
To see if I…

1:00:00.763 --> 1:00:02.181
if I was the monster.

1:00:02.765 --> 1:00:03.641

1:00:06.144 --> 1:00:07.061
Papa!

1:00:08.396 --> 1:00:09.981
And now I know the truth.

1:00:12.233 --> 1:00:13.359
It is not me.

1:00:15.194 --> 1:00:16.279
It is you.

1:00:17.905 --> 1:00:18.906
You

1:00:20.074 --> 1:00:21.451
are the monster.

1:00:24.495 --> 1:00:26.497
I am going to open that door,

1:00:27.081 --> 1:00:28.583
and I am going to leave

1:00:29.667 --> 1:00:31.502
with Dr. Owens.

1:00:33.338 --> 1:00:35.673
If you try to stop me, I will kill you.

1:01:53.793 --> 1:01:54.711
Is this legal?

1:01:56.295 --> 1:01:58.673
Actually, I think it's a felony.

1:01:59.590 --> 1:02:00.425
Right.

1:02:01.092 --> 1:02:02.844
But it guarantees one thing.

1:03:16.834 --> 1:03:17.710
What?

1:03:19.337 --> 1:03:21.297
It's too loose, Lucas.

1:03:21.380 --> 1:03:22.799
This isn't a basketball game

1:03:22.882 --> 1:03:25.510
where they blow the whistle
when your shoes fall off.

1:03:26.302 --> 1:03:28.095
Okay, okay, for the record,

1:03:28.179 --> 1:03:29.722
my shoes never fell off.

1:03:29.806 --> 1:03:31.265
Okay, for the record,

1:03:31.349 --> 1:03:34.352
it's kinda hard for your shoes to fall off
when you're riding the bench.

1:03:34.435 --> 1:03:36.312
Yet, for some reason,

1:03:36.395 --> 1:03:37.939
you show up to every game.

1:03:38.022 --> 1:03:39.941
Mmm, except the one that mattered.

1:03:40.024 --> 1:03:41.692
Plus, Mom and Dad forced me.

1:03:41.776 --> 1:03:44.654
Bull. Mom and Dad
can't force you to do shit.

1:03:44.737 --> 1:03:47.448
Well, even though
you're a bench-riding loser,

1:03:47.532 --> 1:03:48.866
you're still my brother.

1:03:49.367 --> 1:03:50.326
Just the facts.

1:03:53.704 --> 1:03:56.123
-[Steve] It just doesn't make sense.
-What doesn't make sense?

1:03:56.207 --> 1:03:59.669
That was Dan Shelter.
He graduated, like, two years ago.

1:03:59.752 --> 1:04:01.796
-So?
-So he's in college.

1:04:01.879 --> 1:04:03.881
Which means he was visiting
on spring break.

1:04:03.965 --> 1:04:07.218
Fast Times was returned,
like, I don't know, a week ago?

1:04:07.301 --> 1:04:10.096
Right? Unless she's got
some horndog brother we don't know about.

1:04:10.179 --> 1:04:11.931
Which is possible.

1:04:12.014 --> 1:04:14.350
Or she's just really into Judge Reinhold?

1:04:14.433 --> 1:04:15.309
-Steve.
-Nah.

1:04:15.393 --> 1:04:17.270
-What?
-I don't care.

1:04:17.353 --> 1:04:19.981
I don't understand why you do either
with everything that's going on.

1:04:20.064 --> 1:04:23.901
Honestly, this feels like a perfect time
for that little pull of the rug because…

1:04:24.944 --> 1:04:27.405
in the face of the world ending,
the stakes of my love life

1:04:27.488 --> 1:04:29.198
feel spectacularly low.

1:04:30.116 --> 1:04:32.743
Yeah. I mean, I get you there,

1:04:32.827 --> 1:04:35.413
but… I still have hope.

1:04:37.707 --> 1:04:41.294

I have this terrible,

1:04:54.765 --> 1:04:56.309
gnawing feeling that…

1:04:59.061 --> 1:05:01.063
it might not work out for us this time.

1:05:02.273 --> 1:05:04.191
You think we shouldn't be doing this?

1:05:04.734 --> 1:05:08.321
I think we're mad fools,
the lot of us, but…

1:05:10.072 --> 1:05:12.825
[sighs] …but if we don't stop him,
who will?

1:05:12.909 --> 1:05:15.328
[indistinct chatter]

1:05:18.748 --> 1:05:20.374
We have to try, right?

1:05:24.045 --> 1:05:25.129
Yeah.

1:05:29.300 --> 1:05:30.384
To killing Vecna.

You're angry with me.

1:06:27.525 --> 1:06:29.777
[breathing shakily]
