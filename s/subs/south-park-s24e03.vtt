NARRATOR:
From the green hills of Vermont

00:12.823 --> 00:14.892
to the verdant canyons
of Arizona,

00:14.992 --> 00:17.961
people all over the country
are beginning to realize

00:18.062 --> 00:19.863
it's nearly over!

00:19.963 --> 00:24.034
We have almost beaten COVID
and the best news of all:

00:26.904 --> 00:28.939
Infections are
at an all-time low.

00:29.039 --> 00:31.675
New, stronger vaccinations
have ebbed the tide.

00:31.775 --> 00:33.911
And we humans
are cleaning up the mess

00:34.011 --> 00:36.347
and finally
getting on with our lives.

00:36.447 --> 00:39.650
But as we start to get back
to our jobs and schools,

00:39.750 --> 00:41.452
one question remains:

00:41.552 --> 00:45.256
What lingering effects will
the pandemic have on children?

00:45.356 --> 00:48.959
Some say no effect at all.
The children are just fine.

00:49.059 --> 00:50.628
-(chiming)
-We came together

00:50.728 --> 00:52.130
and finally we can say,
we are starting to

00:52.230 --> 00:54.198
-win the war against COVID.
-WOMAN: Stan?

00:54.298 --> 00:56.200
Stan, the phone's for you!

00:56.300 --> 00:57.835
Stan!

00:57.935 --> 01:00.304
What?!

01:00.404 --> 01:02.340
Could you not hear me?

01:02.440 --> 01:04.642
Yeah, dude,
but I'm busy working.

01:04.742 --> 01:06.477
Working on getting drunk again.

01:06.577 --> 01:08.011
I'm not "getting drunk,"

01:08.112 --> 01:10.080
I'm an online
whiskey consultant.

01:10.181 --> 01:11.415
I'm doing research.

01:11.515 --> 01:13.451
Everyone needs
to leave me alone.

01:13.551 --> 01:15.486
The guy on the phone
said it's important.

01:15.586 --> 01:18.722
He said his name
is Kyle Broflovski.

01:19.857 --> 01:21.091
Kyle?

01:23.794 --> 01:25.696
-Hello?
-KYLE: Oh, hi.

01:25.796 --> 01:29.367
Is this Stan Marsh,
from South Park?

01:29.467 --> 01:32.035
-Kyle?
-Oh, dude, it is you!

01:32.136 --> 01:34.205
How have you--
How have you been?

01:34.305 --> 01:36.807
I'm... fine. How are you?

01:36.907 --> 01:38.242
I'm good, I'm...

01:38.342 --> 01:40.678
I know this is weird.
We haven't talked since...

01:40.778 --> 01:42.713
well, you know,
since it all happened.

01:42.813 --> 01:46.417
Yeah, well, the pandemic
is about over now.

01:46.517 --> 01:47.918
I'm moving on with my life.

01:48.018 --> 01:50.421
Stan...
you should come back here.

01:50.521 --> 01:52.556
There's a lot going on.

01:52.656 --> 01:55.193
There's nothing in
South Park for me, Kyle!

01:55.293 --> 01:57.195
I'm not going back there, ever.

01:57.295 --> 01:59.630
Look, dude, you remember
when we were little?

01:59.730 --> 02:01.699
When the pandemic...
first started.

02:01.799 --> 02:03.434
Us friends said
we'd always be there

02:03.534 --> 02:04.802
for each other
when things got bad.

02:04.902 --> 02:07.238
What do you mean?
What's happened?

02:07.338 --> 02:08.606
Stan...

02:08.706 --> 02:11.775
It's Kenny. He's dead.

Tonight's guest,
First Lady Tom Kardashian!

02:41.339 --> 02:45.976
And now here he is,
the king of woke comedy, Jimmy!

02:46.076 --> 02:48.145
(audience cheering)

02:48.246 --> 02:49.447
Wow.

02:49.547 --> 02:51.649
Wow, what a terrific audience.

02:51.749 --> 02:54.017
What a fantastic audience, wow.

02:54.117 --> 02:55.386
(cheering quiets)

02:55.486 --> 02:58.021
Geez, what's the deal
with these Mexicans, huh?

02:58.121 --> 02:59.290
(laughter)

02:59.390 --> 03:01.124
I mean, they have fabulous food,

03:01.225 --> 03:02.926
their country
has amazing beaches,

03:03.026 --> 03:06.230
and they're
really fantastic people.

03:06.330 --> 03:07.698
(cheering and applause)

03:07.798 --> 03:09.667
Wow, what a great audience.

03:10.568 --> 03:11.935
You know,
today I was on the subway

03:12.035 --> 03:14.238
and I saw an ad
for the Center for People

03:14.338 --> 03:17.708
Who Identify as Homosexual
But Were Born Bi.

03:17.808 --> 03:19.277
-(laughter)
-Have you seen this?

03:19.377 --> 03:20.544
Have you heard about this?

03:20.644 --> 03:22.079
I'll tell you one thing--

03:22.179 --> 03:23.647
those people are brave
and deserve

03:23.747 --> 03:26.417
-every ounce of our respect.
-(cheering)

03:26.517 --> 03:27.851
S-Stick around.

03:27.951 --> 03:29.687
First Lady Tom Kardashian
is here.

03:29.787 --> 03:31.789
We'll be right back!

03:31.889 --> 03:33.090
(band playing in distance)

03:33.190 --> 03:34.692
Jimmy, we got
a call from corporate.

03:34.792 --> 03:36.159
They want you to cut
the hummus joke.

03:36.260 --> 03:37.395
What?!

03:37.495 --> 03:39.129
It's hard enough
doing comedy these days.

03:39.229 --> 03:40.898
Now I'm getting notes
during commercial breaks?!

03:40.998 --> 03:43.000
You're just gonna have to joke
about something else.

03:43.100 --> 03:45.035
All right, fine, what else
is going on in the news? Quick!

03:45.135 --> 03:48.339
Uh, Amazon thinks they might
have discovered gold on Mars.

03:48.439 --> 03:50.073
Ah, Jesus. Anything else?

03:50.173 --> 03:52.376
Uh, that famous
eccentric scientist died.

03:52.476 --> 03:55.513
The millionaire philanthropist?
Dr. McCormick?

03:56.880 --> 03:59.650
Kenny? Kenny's dead?

03:59.750 --> 04:01.352
Oh, I'm sorry,
did you know him?

04:01.452 --> 04:03.721
We were friends when we
were kids. Let me see that!

04:03.821 --> 04:06.023
ANNOUNCER: "Very
mysterious circumstances."

04:06.123 --> 04:08.292
That's what doctors
are saying about

04:08.392 --> 04:09.760
the death of beloved scientist

04:09.860 --> 04:12.396
and humanitarian,
Dr. Kenny McCormick.

04:12.496 --> 04:15.299
McCormick was a pioneer of
science and technology

04:15.399 --> 04:18.402
who was always trying to unlock
the key to a better future.

04:18.502 --> 04:21.772
He worked tirelessly--
some say balls-out crazily--

04:21.872 --> 04:23.574
on new inventions and theories

04:23.674 --> 04:26.710
but somehow his biggest
questions seemed to elude him.

04:26.810 --> 04:28.879
The head of NASA said,
"We have lost

04:28.979 --> 04:30.714
"an innovator and a visionary.

04:30.814 --> 04:33.016
"Kenny was so brilliant
that most of the time,

04:33.116 --> 04:35.786
we couldn't even understand
what he was saying."

04:37.120 --> 04:38.822
Get me a first-class ticket
to South Park!

04:38.922 --> 04:41.625
What? You can't leave!
You have to get back onstage!

04:41.725 --> 04:43.293
The first lady is here!

04:43.394 --> 04:45.095
Tell Tom Kardashian to suck my

04:45.195 --> 04:48.231
P-P-Popsicles
that are in the green room,

04:48.332 --> 04:49.500
and that I am very sorry,

a fantastic person.

Stan, wake up,
I think we're here.

05:18.762 --> 05:20.030
So that's it, huh?

05:20.130 --> 05:23.066
-That's the town you grew up in?
-STAN: Yeah.

05:23.166 --> 05:26.770
Well, how does it feel to
be back after all these years?

05:27.571 --> 05:30.207
It feels shitty, okay?
Can you please shut the fuck up?

05:30.307 --> 05:32.743
Why did you even bring me
along if you're not going

05:32.843 --> 05:34.344
to let me help you
through this?!

05:34.445 --> 05:35.746

06:01.672 --> 06:03.240
* Running out of time *

* There's no room
in this ol' heart of mine *

06:07.044 --> 06:11.381
* So much pressure
to keep holdin' on *

06:11.482 --> 06:17.054
* Pack my clothes up, baby,
I'll be gone *

06:17.154 --> 06:21.124
* Stir it up, I've got to
break it up now *

06:21.224 --> 06:22.893
* When I think about tomorrow *

06:22.993 --> 06:25.796
* I can't wait to *

06:25.896 --> 06:28.031
* Stir it up *

06:28.131 --> 06:29.867
* Got to shake it up now *

06:29.967 --> 06:32.069
* If I have to beg or borrow *

06:32.169 --> 06:33.671
* I don't wanna *

06:33.771 --> 06:36.740
* Take it anymore *

06:36.840 --> 06:39.009
* Got to break it up now *

06:39.109 --> 06:41.845

Come taste the difference.

07:03.033 --> 07:07.037
(soft electronic music playing)

07:08.205 --> 07:10.040
(sighs)

07:11.074 --> 07:13.043
-Hey, dude.
-Hey, dude.

07:15.078 --> 07:16.680
Wow. This is crazy, huh?

07:16.780 --> 07:18.916
I mean, how long has it been?

07:19.016 --> 07:21.785
I guess...
since we were nine.

07:21.885 --> 07:23.453
Well, have a seat.

07:24.722 --> 07:25.923
What have you been up to?

07:26.023 --> 07:27.457
Oh, dude,
just all kinds of stuff.

07:27.558 --> 07:29.026
You know, getting stuff going.

07:29.126 --> 07:31.695
Got my own online
whiskey consultant gig.

07:31.795 --> 07:33.230
I'm totally happy.
What about you?

07:33.330 --> 07:35.098
Oh, I'm getting things
going, too.

07:35.198 --> 07:38.435
I'm doing a sort of counseling
online start-up thing.

07:38.536 --> 07:39.837
Really doing great, too.

07:39.937 --> 07:42.339
-Sweet.
-Listen, Stan...

07:42.439 --> 07:45.976
I know that we disagreed
a lot during the pandemic,

07:46.076 --> 07:47.645
but I hope we can
put that aside...

07:47.745 --> 07:50.247
Dude, Kyle,
I'm just here for Kenny.

07:50.347 --> 07:51.849
All right, well,

07:51.949 --> 07:54.484
there's something you should
know about the way Kenny died.

07:54.585 --> 07:57.087
Hi, guys, welcome to
Denny's Applebee's Max.

07:57.187 --> 07:58.922
I see you
got your menus already.

07:59.022 --> 08:00.190
As you're deciding
what to order,

08:00.290 --> 08:01.525
I just want to go over
a couple things.

08:01.625 --> 08:02.960
Now, of course, it is the future

08:03.060 --> 08:04.928
so we don't have any meat
on the menu.

08:05.028 --> 08:06.630
'Cause you know,
here in the future,

08:06.730 --> 08:08.866
we've all decided meat is wrong.

08:08.966 --> 08:10.200
Yeah, we know.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.035
Okay, and, uh,
you'll see there's

08:12.135 --> 08:14.237
some dishes made
from insect protein on the menu.

08:14.337 --> 08:16.439
That, of course, is because
here in the future,

08:16.540 --> 08:18.341
we've all learned that insects
are a valuable and sustainable

08:18.441 --> 08:21.645
food and we no longer
fear it as a food. Mm-hmm.

08:21.745 --> 08:23.280
We know, dude.

08:23.380 --> 08:25.515
Okay, well, if you have any
questions, please don't hesitate

08:25.616 --> 08:28.351
to say anything, because,
you know, it's the future.

08:28.451 --> 08:31.521
We've learned to all just
get along and love each other.

08:33.190 --> 08:35.225
Look, Stan,
Kenny was trying to find

08:35.325 --> 08:37.460
the answers
to some pretty heavy stuff.

08:37.561 --> 08:40.130
He felt like there
were people responsible

08:40.230 --> 08:41.732
for everything that's happened.

08:41.832 --> 08:43.433
Like who?

08:43.533 --> 08:47.070
That's just it. Nobody knows.
But whoever these people are,

08:47.170 --> 08:49.707
they didn't want
Kenny McCormick exposing them.

08:49.807 --> 08:51.875
Wait a minute. Token?

08:51.975 --> 08:53.543
Yeah, it's me.

08:53.644 --> 08:55.979
Just before he died,
Kenny was texting me

08:56.079 --> 08:57.815
that he was on
to something huge.

08:57.915 --> 08:59.416
And he was texting me, too.

08:59.516 --> 09:01.018
Saying he'd discovered
something that

09:01.118 --> 09:02.319
could change the world.

09:02.419 --> 09:03.654
And then he died,

09:03.754 --> 09:05.255
and the hospital won't say how.

09:05.355 --> 09:07.090
And that got us thinking...

09:07.190 --> 09:10.427
Oh, my God.
They killed Kenny.

09:12.930 --> 09:14.164
I'm just here for the funeral.

09:14.264 --> 09:16.867
I don't want to be a part
of anything else.

09:16.967 --> 09:18.201
Dude, there might be
people to blame

09:18.301 --> 09:20.303
for ruining our childhoods.

09:20.403 --> 09:22.105
So what do you wanna do, Kyle?

09:22.205 --> 09:25.108
Go on some bullshit adventure
like when we were kids?

09:25.208 --> 09:27.444
Maybe, maybe we can call
Jesus and Santa

09:27.544 --> 09:30.547
and ask them for help.
Is that what you want?

09:30.648 --> 09:34.184
It's the fucking future,
you guys. Grow up.

09:40.023 --> 09:43.360
Hello, welcome to
the Super 12 Motel Plus.

09:43.460 --> 09:45.729
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, Stan Marsh.

09:45.829 --> 09:47.530
I have a room for one night.

09:47.631 --> 09:52.169
Okay, I see you're in one of
our Mach Ten Super Plus rooms.

09:52.269 --> 09:54.571
Now, of course,
we only take Bitcoin

09:54.672 --> 09:56.106
and other cryptocurrency 'cause,

09:56.206 --> 09:57.607
you know, it's the future.

09:57.708 --> 09:59.609
We've all decided
centralized banking is rigged,

09:59.710 --> 10:02.479
so we trust more in
fly-by-night Ponzi schemes.

10:02.579 --> 10:04.081
Yeah, I know.

10:07.384 --> 10:09.319
So you walked out on
all your friends and then

10:09.419 --> 10:11.188
just hung out at a bar all day?

10:11.288 --> 10:14.825
Alexa, fucking just go
throw yourself out a window.

10:14.925 --> 10:17.160
I'm sorry.
I didn't quite get that.

10:17.260 --> 10:20.463
Nothing.
Alexa, turn on the TV.

10:20.563 --> 10:23.867
Oh, God, you are
such a piece of shit.

10:23.967 --> 10:25.268
-(TV chimes)
-You know,

10:25.368 --> 10:27.104
if you had
Remote Prime membership,

10:27.204 --> 10:29.106
you could watch Amazon movies
wherever you go.

10:29.206 --> 10:30.674
Would you like to get started?

10:30.774 --> 10:32.409
-No.
-I'm sorry.

10:32.509 --> 10:34.644
I'm trying
to be fucking helpful.

10:34.745 --> 10:37.147
Why don't you grow up
and start acting like an adult

10:37.247 --> 10:38.615
for once in your life...

10:38.716 --> 10:39.817
Alexa, stop!

10:39.917 --> 10:41.051
Fuck you!

10:41.151 --> 10:43.754
(news theme volume increases)

10:43.854 --> 10:47.624
Jon, I'm standing outside
the South Park Flash Rail Max,

10:47.725 --> 10:49.492
where hundreds of people
are coming to

10:49.592 --> 10:52.495
pay their respects
to Dr. Kenny McCormick.

10:52.595 --> 10:55.098
There's still no word
from the hospital

10:55.198 --> 10:57.300
on what exactly
killed Kenny McCormick,

10:57.400 --> 10:59.669
but letters sent to multiple
news outlets reveal

10:59.770 --> 11:02.439
that he might have
known his life was in danger.

11:02.539 --> 11:06.643
Dr. McCormick said,
"I am about to expose the truth.

11:06.744 --> 11:09.112
"In the event of my death
I have hidden away

11:09.212 --> 11:10.714
"all relevant information.

11:10.814 --> 11:13.717
My closest friends
will know where to find it."

11:13.817 --> 11:15.385
Dr. Kenneth McCormick.

11:15.485 --> 11:18.255
He wanted to make the future
a better place.

11:18.355 --> 11:22.259
Too bad he died, 'cause
the future certainly sucks.

11:23.493 --> 11:25.528
* *

11:33.003 --> 11:34.037
(doorbell rings)

11:34.137 --> 11:36.373
* Someone's at the door *

11:36.473 --> 11:38.375
* This is the doorbell *

11:38.475 --> 11:41.879
* It's the future
so doorbells sing. *

11:41.979 --> 11:44.047
Yeah, I know.

11:44.982 --> 11:46.784
Okay, so you were right.

11:46.884 --> 11:48.318
Kenny was on to some bad people

11:48.418 --> 11:50.387
and he hid something
for us to find.

11:50.487 --> 11:52.222
Yeah, I saw.
Only problem is

11:52.322 --> 11:53.656
I don't know
what he's talking about.

11:53.757 --> 11:55.625
But thank you
for saying I was right.

11:55.725 --> 11:57.560
You're welcome. It doesn't mean
that you were right

11:57.660 --> 11:58.929
about everything
during the pandemic.

11:59.029 --> 11:59.930
Because you weren't.

12:00.030 --> 12:01.498
Okay, well, obviously

12:01.598 --> 12:03.433
we're never going to agree
on certain things,

12:03.533 --> 12:05.068
so we shouldn't talk about them.

12:05.168 --> 12:07.805
Sounds good.
So let's go to Kenny's wake

12:07.905 --> 12:09.339
and see if anyone else shows up

12:09.439 --> 12:11.108
who might know what
Kenny's talking about.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.043
Let's do that.

12:16.579 --> 12:18.615
(busy chatter)

12:20.617 --> 12:23.486
Hello. Testing.
Hey, everybody.

12:23.586 --> 12:26.056
It's amazing to see you all
here for Kenny's wake.

12:27.157 --> 12:28.725
Wow, what a great audience.

12:28.826 --> 12:30.327
Uh, for those of you
who don't know,

12:30.427 --> 12:31.829
my name is Jimmy Valmer and, uh,

12:31.929 --> 12:34.764
I had to take an Asian airline
to get here today.

12:34.865 --> 12:36.566
You know what they say
about Asian airlines--

12:36.666 --> 12:38.235
they're dependable
and just as efficient

12:38.335 --> 12:40.103
as any other competent airline.

12:40.203 --> 12:42.672
(whooping and cheering)

12:42.772 --> 12:44.541
What a terrific audience.

12:44.641 --> 12:46.643
So many people
have come for Kenny today--

12:46.743 --> 12:49.779
so many amazing friends
I haven't seen in ages.

12:49.880 --> 12:52.682
You know, I had a friend once
who was a Polish hair stylist.

12:52.782 --> 12:55.685
Talk about an amazing haircut
at an affordable price.

12:55.785 --> 12:58.288
(whooping and cheering)

12:58.388 --> 12:59.823
Well, I know that
we're all ready

12:59.923 --> 13:01.791
to talk to each other
and share our memories of Kenny.

13:01.892 --> 13:03.660
So please just have fun
and we'll see you

13:03.760 --> 13:06.063
-at the funeral tomorrow.
-(applause)

13:06.163 --> 13:08.999
(electronic drumbeat playing)

13:09.099 --> 13:11.334
* We are all, you and me *

13:11.434 --> 13:14.504
* We are all living
in the future *

13:14.604 --> 13:16.673
* We are all in the future... *

13:16.773 --> 13:18.141
-(groans)
-Stan?

13:18.241 --> 13:20.277
-Stan Marsh?
-Yeah?

13:20.377 --> 13:22.679
Hi. It's Wendy.

13:22.779 --> 13:24.982
Wendy Testaburger, wow.

13:25.082 --> 13:27.050
Yeah. My husband, Darwin.

13:27.150 --> 13:28.718
Hey, pal, how are ya?

13:28.818 --> 13:30.921
Hey, guys.
It's Tweek and Craig.

13:31.021 --> 13:32.689
Oh, hey.
How are you guys?

13:32.789 --> 13:33.924
We're good.

13:34.024 --> 13:35.392
(straining):
I have a lot of anxiety

13:35.492 --> 13:36.726
being back
with all these people!

13:36.826 --> 13:38.595
Wendy's told me a lot
about you, Stan.

13:38.695 --> 13:40.864
How's everything
with the family?

13:40.964 --> 13:44.401
Excuse me, I'm gonna go
get, uh, drunk.

13:44.501 --> 13:46.736
-What's wrong with Stan?
-We're just...

13:46.836 --> 13:48.505
trying to find out
what happened to Kenny.

13:48.605 --> 13:51.574
I think this goes deeper
than you guys realize.

13:53.176 --> 13:55.979
Hey, Stan Marsh!
Good to see you.

13:56.079 --> 13:58.081
It's me, Clyde Donovan.

13:58.181 --> 13:59.449
Oh, hey, Clyde.

13:59.549 --> 14:01.784
What have you been doing
during the pandemic?

14:01.885 --> 14:03.386
Oh, you know, lots of stuff.

14:03.486 --> 14:06.423
Yeah, me, too.
Sucks about Kenny, huh?

14:06.523 --> 14:07.590
Hope they find
all the information

14:07.690 --> 14:09.559
-on that thing he hid.
-You know

14:09.659 --> 14:11.128
where he might have hid it?

14:11.228 --> 14:14.697
No, I don't.
But I bet someone here does.

14:14.797 --> 14:16.900
It's really great
to see you guys again.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.502
These past few decades
have been really tough.

14:19.602 --> 14:22.772
Yeah, sometimes I think
the pandemic really aged me.

14:22.872 --> 14:25.475
Kyle, can I talk to you
for a second?

14:26.276 --> 14:29.246
-Dude, he's here.
-Who's here?

14:30.313 --> 14:33.216
-Cartman?
-Yeah, but he's changed.

14:33.316 --> 14:34.584
Changed how?

14:34.684 --> 14:36.453
Yes, I know,
it's been a long time

14:36.553 --> 14:37.754
since we've seen each other.

14:37.854 --> 14:39.122
I'm doing really well.

14:39.222 --> 14:41.091
I'm actually the head
of Gespetzah Synagogue

14:41.191 --> 14:42.392
down in Colorado Springs.

14:42.492 --> 14:44.461
Can you believe it?
I'm a rabbi.

14:44.561 --> 14:47.998
Yeah, you know, when
the whole pandemic happened,

14:48.098 --> 14:49.299
I think it changed me.

14:49.399 --> 14:51.334
It really changed me
for the better.

14:51.434 --> 14:52.769
-It did?
-No.

14:52.869 --> 14:55.472
-He's fucking with me.
-What? Oh, yeah.

14:55.572 --> 14:58.175
Yeah, I get it,
the Eric Cartman you guys knew

14:58.275 --> 15:00.043
didn't seem like
he'd become a rabbi.

15:00.143 --> 15:02.179
But I found real meaning
in the Torah

15:02.279 --> 15:04.281
and then I found a great
Jewish woman and...

15:04.381 --> 15:07.284
let the spirit of the Talmud
guide our lives.

15:07.384 --> 15:08.952
Okay, jut knock it off, fat-ass.

15:09.052 --> 15:10.220
Dude.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.821
Wow, that's very big
of you, Kyle.

15:11.921 --> 15:14.824
Still living in South Park
and calling people fat-ass, huh?

15:14.924 --> 15:17.127
Wait, I'm sorry,
that was uncalled for.

15:17.227 --> 15:18.795
It's not fucking funny, Cartman!

15:18.895 --> 15:21.398
Stop pretending you
have a happy Jewish life!

15:21.498 --> 15:23.033
Hey, shoogina!
I'm sorry, I couldn't

15:23.133 --> 15:25.902
wait in the car anymore;
I had to meet your friends.

15:26.003 --> 15:28.972
Oh, that's okay.
Guys, this is my wife, Yentl.

15:29.072 --> 15:31.674
I've heard so many stories
about you all.

15:31.774 --> 15:33.543
It must have been amazing
to grow up

15:33.643 --> 15:35.412
in these beautiful mountains!

15:35.512 --> 15:37.981
Yentl? Her name is Yentl?

15:38.081 --> 15:41.384
Can we fucking stop this
and talk about Kenny, please?!

15:41.484 --> 15:45.422
-Oh, is that, uh...?
-Yeah, that's-that's Kyle, yeah.

15:45.522 --> 15:47.490
I'm sorry, honey, can you
just give me a couple minutes?

15:47.590 --> 15:49.392
I just need a few more
seconds with them

15:49.492 --> 15:50.527
and I'll be right out
to the car.

15:50.627 --> 15:52.029
Oh, okay, I get it.

15:52.129 --> 15:53.396
Nice to meet you guys.

15:53.496 --> 15:55.365
We'll see you at the funeral,
I guess.

15:55.465 --> 15:57.400
And I'm very sorry
for your loss.

15:57.500 --> 16:00.103
Bye, Mrs. Cartman.

16:00.203 --> 16:04.041
Okay, look, guys, Kenny and I
were still really good friends.

16:04.141 --> 16:07.144
He used to email me all the time
about stuff he was doing.

16:07.244 --> 16:08.411
Yeah, me, too!

16:08.511 --> 16:10.180
Well, so then maybe he also

16:10.280 --> 16:12.149
told you that
he was trying to find

16:12.249 --> 16:13.950
the origin of the coronavirus.

16:14.051 --> 16:15.718
What are you talking about?

16:15.818 --> 16:18.855
Kenny was obsessed with
how corona first got started.

16:18.955 --> 16:22.492
He was clearly on to something,
and then he died.

16:22.592 --> 16:24.894
I know we all want
to solve this for him.

16:24.994 --> 16:26.996
You know, in the Torah,
when Abraham

16:27.097 --> 16:28.298
first heard the word of God...

16:28.398 --> 16:29.999
Just knock it off!
You don't believe

16:30.100 --> 16:31.534
a word of that shit.
You're just doing all this

16:31.634 --> 16:33.002
to get a rise out of me.

16:33.103 --> 16:34.237
Kyle, you really think

16:34.337 --> 16:35.672
I would spend 40 years
of my life

16:35.772 --> 16:37.340
just to get a rise out of you?

16:37.440 --> 16:40.077
-Yes, I do!
-Same ol' Kyle.

16:40.177 --> 16:41.478
Well, I got to go, guys.

16:41.578 --> 16:43.713
I'll see you at Kenny's funeral
tomorrow.

16:46.316 --> 16:47.684
Maybe he's really changed.

16:47.784 --> 16:51.521
No. He is fucking with me.

17:03.032 --> 17:04.801
INTERVIEWER (on TV):
Sometimes I feel like

17:04.901 --> 17:07.170
things weren't supposed
to be like this.

17:07.270 --> 17:10.307
Like maybe there are others
in control of the way

17:10.407 --> 17:11.841
it all turned out.

17:11.941 --> 17:14.043
Is that what you're saying,
Dr. McCormick?

17:14.144 --> 17:17.747
Are you saying that there are
other people responsible?

17:17.847 --> 17:21.118
I guess what I'm trying to say,
Dr. McCormick, is...

17:21.218 --> 17:24.954
your theories seem to point to
some kind of people with power.

17:25.054 --> 17:29.126
Let me put it another way--
we've all seen the pictures

17:29.226 --> 17:31.594
of you working in Egypt,
lecturing at MIT.

17:31.694 --> 17:34.131
And you always seem to
come back to this concept

17:34.231 --> 17:37.400
of this mysterious
organization who is to blame.

17:37.500 --> 17:39.469
-Let me put it yet
another way, Dr. McCormick.
-Hang on a second.

17:39.569 --> 17:42.439
What was that?
Alexa, freeze the video.

17:42.539 --> 17:43.973
-What?
-Freeze video

17:44.073 --> 17:46.476
and reverse playback
ten seconds.

17:49.279 --> 17:50.513
Stop there.

17:53.683 --> 17:55.352
Enhance image 20%.

17:55.452 --> 17:56.886
Ugh. Whatever.

17:56.986 --> 17:58.855
(beeps, whirs)

18:00.390 --> 18:01.924
Shift right ten frames.

18:02.024 --> 18:04.026
(beeps, whirs)

18:04.127 --> 18:05.061
Enhance.

18:05.162 --> 18:06.696
(beeps, whirs)

18:06.796 --> 18:08.731
ALEXA:
Tegridy Weed?

18:08.831 --> 18:12.302
Isn't that your dad's
old marijuana company?

18:12.402 --> 18:15.738
Oh, shit.

18:15.838 --> 18:17.874
* *

18:24.514 --> 18:28.050
Hi. Welcome.
Welcome, my friends.

18:28.151 --> 18:29.719
So blessed to have you here.

18:29.819 --> 18:32.121
Hello, my child,
thank you for coming.

18:32.222 --> 18:34.090
-Yeah, sure.
-Wait, Stan?

18:34.191 --> 18:35.658
Stan Marsh?

18:35.758 --> 18:38.328
Praise be!
I haven't seen you in ages!

18:38.428 --> 18:40.029
I'm sorry, do I know you?

18:40.129 --> 18:41.464
Well, sure, it's me!

18:41.564 --> 18:43.866
Scott Malkinson!
Remember me?

18:44.701 --> 18:46.936
-Uh, no, sorry.
-I hung out with you guys

18:47.036 --> 18:48.805
all the time
when we were little.

18:48.905 --> 18:50.640
I was the kid with the lisp.

18:50.740 --> 18:53.643
-Who had diabetes?
-Oh, yeah, sure...

18:53.743 --> 18:56.213
Great to see you again.

18:57.013 --> 18:58.715
Hey, guys.
Great to see you in church.

18:58.815 --> 19:00.883
-It's Scott Malkinson.
-Who?

19:00.983 --> 19:03.353
Scott Malkinson, I went
to school with you guys?

19:03.453 --> 19:04.754
Oh, okay.

19:04.854 --> 19:08.725
Hello. Welcome. Hey!
It's me! Scott Malkinson!

19:08.825 --> 19:11.494
With the diabetes. No?

19:12.362 --> 19:16.599
Kenny McCormick was
a cherished son, a wise man,

19:16.699 --> 19:18.134
and a wonderful friend.

19:18.235 --> 19:20.169
Kenny touched all
of our lives and made

19:20.270 --> 19:24.207
each and every one of us
laugh, cry and ponder.

19:24.307 --> 19:25.708
And in his death,

19:25.808 --> 19:28.511
now we can reflect on
our own lives.

19:28.611 --> 19:30.880
Are we happy?

19:30.980 --> 19:34.217
Are we the person
we hoped to be?

19:34.317 --> 19:37.820
Have we, like Kenny,
given all that we can

19:37.920 --> 19:40.056
to forgive those around us?

19:40.156 --> 19:41.724
For life is short,

19:41.824 --> 19:44.794
and our family and friends
must be cherished.

19:44.894 --> 19:48.298
You know, in many ways,
death is like diabetes.

19:48.398 --> 19:51.133
You spend your whole life
trying to fight it off

19:51.234 --> 19:53.903
but ultimately it just wins.

19:54.003 --> 19:57.574
And so let's take the time now
to reach out to our friends.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.108
To reach out to our family.

19:59.208 --> 20:01.744
To tell our mothers
and our fathers that we...

20:01.844 --> 20:04.747
All right! All right! Who
the fuck put you up to this?

20:04.847 --> 20:06.916
Did you write
this goddamn speech, Kyle?

20:07.016 --> 20:08.685
Did you tell him
to say all this stuff?

20:08.785 --> 20:11.120
What the fuck
are you talking about?

20:11.220 --> 20:13.122
You know that I know something
about Kenny

20:13.222 --> 20:15.525
that I'm not telling you because
it involves my father,

20:15.625 --> 20:17.093
who I don't want to face!

20:17.193 --> 20:19.762
That's crazy and you'd be able
to face what happened

20:19.862 --> 20:22.064
to your family if you
weren't a fucking asshole!

20:22.164 --> 20:24.601
Guys, please,
this is a house of God.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.035
You shut the fuck up!

20:26.135 --> 20:29.205
You judge me,
you all sit here and judge me.

20:29.306 --> 20:31.040
Well, fuck all of you!

20:31.140 --> 20:33.910
This is exactly why I moved out
of this hick-ass town!

20:34.010 --> 20:35.912
And I am going back home
to the city!

20:36.012 --> 20:38.281
My child, please,
we are gathered in Christ...

20:38.381 --> 20:39.816
(mockingly): My child, please,
we are gathered in Christ.

20:39.916 --> 20:42.719
I'm Scott Malkinson.
I have diabetes.

20:45.254 --> 20:47.156
He does remember me!

20:47.256 --> 20:49.592
Alexa, start the car!

20:50.527 --> 20:52.329
Start the car?
Where are you going?

20:52.429 --> 20:54.764
I need to stop at a store
and then we're going home.

20:54.864 --> 20:56.433
What about the connection
you just found

20:56.533 --> 20:57.834
between Kenny and your father?

20:57.934 --> 21:00.169
Alexa, find the nearest
liquor store.

21:00.269 --> 21:01.771
Oh, you wanna get drunk?

21:01.871 --> 21:03.773
Let me guess-- someone said
something you didn't like

21:03.873 --> 21:06.008
and it made you want to
pound beer and wine?

21:06.108 --> 21:07.910
It's not
"pounding beer and wine."

21:08.010 --> 21:09.946
I drop wine shots into the beer.

21:10.046 --> 21:12.181
It's called a "smorgasvein"
and it's very cultural!

21:12.281 --> 21:15.151
Stop acting like a child and
support your dead friend, Stan!

21:15.251 --> 21:18.120
-You don't even have any...
-Alexa, stop!

21:19.589 --> 21:20.723
(car beeps)

21:20.823 --> 21:23.025
(tires screeching)

21:24.126 --> 21:25.895
Thank you.
Thank you, Father.

21:25.995 --> 21:28.331
Hello, everyone.
My name is Rabbi Cartman

21:28.431 --> 21:32.001
and I was Kenny McCormick's
very, very best friend.

21:32.101 --> 21:36.272
Kenny was not a Jew,
but he had so many

21:36.373 --> 21:38.007
amazing Jewish qualities.

21:38.107 --> 21:40.176
Qualities that I see
in my loving wife

21:40.276 --> 21:43.846
and my amazing kids,
that are right over there.

21:43.946 --> 21:45.615
Over there by Kyle.

21:45.715 --> 21:47.950
And as we all return now
to our homes

21:48.050 --> 21:50.820
and our lives, I think that--
a lot like Abraham--

21:50.920 --> 21:53.490
-let's not forget that...
-Excuse me. Everyone?

21:53.590 --> 21:54.924
Hello?

21:55.024 --> 21:57.026
Everyone, can I have
your attention, please?

21:57.126 --> 22:00.830
We got results from the PNR scan
of Dr. McCormick's remains

22:00.930 --> 22:03.065
and we now know
the cause of his death.

22:03.165 --> 22:06.536
-(murmuring)
-Now we all need to stay calm.

22:06.636 --> 22:09.472
There is no reason
to panic, but...

22:09.572 --> 22:11.874
Kenny died of COVID.

22:11.974 --> 22:13.242
It's a new variant.

22:13.342 --> 22:17.847
The COVID Delta Plus
Rewards Program variant.

22:18.681 --> 22:20.650
(all screaming)

22:20.750 --> 22:22.084
Everyone, please!

22:22.184 --> 22:23.753
We cannot panic!

22:23.853 --> 22:26.088
(all screaming and clamoring)

22:29.191 --> 22:31.928
(whooshing)

22:32.729 --> 22:35.398
(all screaming)

22:40.970 --> 22:43.105
That's it! We're all out
of chin diapers!

22:43.205 --> 22:45.875
Oh, God, we're all out
of chin diapers!

22:45.975 --> 22:49.311
(frantic groaning)

22:49.412 --> 22:50.447
Zoom...

22:50.547 --> 22:51.848
(muttering)

22:51.948 --> 22:53.583
Come on, come on, come on!
Remote learning!

22:53.683 --> 22:55.618
Come on, come on, come on!

22:55.718 --> 22:59.255
(horns honking)

23:02.459 --> 23:03.860
Alexa, what's going on?

23:03.960 --> 23:06.829
ALEXA: There's some kind
of road closure ahead.

23:13.369 --> 23:16.806
Set up a perimeter!
I want all exit points sealed.

23:21.478 --> 23:23.112
People of South Park,

23:23.212 --> 23:26.048
there is an outbreak of COVID
in your community.

23:26.148 --> 23:27.917
You are being quarantined.

23:28.718 --> 23:32.088
Hey, dude! I don't live here.
I need to get home!

23:32.188 --> 23:34.924
Nobody is going in or out.

23:35.024 --> 23:38.060
We have confirmation that
one person in this community

23:38.160 --> 23:40.563
has never been vaccinated
against COVID,

23:40.663 --> 23:42.899
so we must quarantine everyone.

23:42.999 --> 23:45.635
One person?!
Well, who is it?!

23:45.735 --> 23:47.904
We are not allowed to say.

23:48.004 --> 23:50.106
But if you tell us who
the unvaccinated person is,

23:50.206 --> 23:52.575
we can have them vaccinated
and then this will all be over!

23:52.675 --> 23:56.178
We can't tell you who it is
because, in case you forgot,

23:56.278 --> 23:59.749
it's the future, and we don't
single out or ridicule anyone

23:59.849 --> 24:01.784
for their personal beliefs.

24:01.884 --> 24:04.020
Gah! I hate the future!

24:04.120 --> 24:05.922
What does this mean?

24:06.022 --> 24:07.924
Yeah, what's it mean, Daddy?

24:08.024 --> 24:09.992
I think it means...

24:10.092 --> 24:12.294
we're all stuck in South Park.

24:13.329 --> 24:15.932
(busy chatter)

24:17.934 --> 24:19.101
-(groans)
-Okay, there we go.

24:19.201 --> 24:20.302
We'll get back
with the results.

24:20.402 --> 24:21.771
Maintain six feet
social distance

24:21.871 --> 24:23.205
and stay indoors.
Thank you.

24:23.305 --> 24:24.406
Next, please!

24:25.174 --> 24:26.943
Yeah, listen, I have to
get out of here.

24:27.043 --> 24:28.177
Yes, don't we all.

24:28.277 --> 24:29.679
No, no, no,
I don't belong here

24:29.779 --> 24:31.213
and I don't have
anywhere to stay.

24:31.313 --> 24:33.049
They've shut down
all the motels.

24:33.149 --> 24:35.317
Do you have any friends or
family that you can stay with?

24:35.417 --> 24:37.119
No, these people
are not my friends

24:37.219 --> 24:38.788
and I have no family here.

24:38.888 --> 24:40.723
-Oka-- (groans)
-It's okay.

24:40.823 --> 24:42.291
They've set up
an emergency shelter

24:42.391 --> 24:44.827
for all the people who were here
from out of town.

24:44.927 --> 24:47.129
Where?

24:49.932 --> 24:53.002
(indistinct chatter)

25:02.011 --> 25:03.613
PC PRINCIPAL: All right,
everyone, listen up.

25:03.713 --> 25:05.047
No way.

25:05.147 --> 25:07.183
Welcome to
South Park Elementary.

25:07.283 --> 25:09.451
We want to help you all
be as comfortable as possible.

25:09.552 --> 25:11.854
So we will have quiet time
from 9:00 p.m.

25:11.954 --> 25:14.290
to 6:00 a.m. every day.
I don't want to hear

25:14.390 --> 25:17.259
any fucking gender-specific
language in here.

25:17.359 --> 25:19.562
And if anybody here
casts a movie with someone

25:19.662 --> 25:21.964
other than the culture
that that movie is about,

25:22.064 --> 25:23.600
you are fucking out of here!

25:23.700 --> 25:28.337
All right, thank you.
It is now 9:01. Lights out.

25:32.575 --> 25:34.811
* *

25:40.049 --> 25:43.052
It's been a long time
since I've prayed.

25:44.020 --> 25:46.355
I don't know
if anyone can hear me...

25:46.455 --> 25:49.225
but we all really
need help right now.

25:50.026 --> 25:52.494
I know in my heart
that Kenny didn't just die

25:52.595 --> 25:54.864
of some new COVID variant.

25:54.964 --> 25:58.334
I know there's something
way bigger going on.

25:58.434 --> 26:01.871
But it all seems like
so much to take on.

26:01.971 --> 26:04.540
Please, if there's
anyone who could

26:04.641 --> 26:08.945
help see me through this,
it would be a miracle.

26:09.879 --> 26:10.947
(water splashes)

26:11.047 --> 26:13.315
* *

26:24.460 --> 26:25.728
(doorbell rings)

26:25.828 --> 26:28.297
* Someone's at the door *

26:28.397 --> 26:30.833
-(groans)
-* This is the doorbell *

26:30.933 --> 26:32.669
* Apparently in the future *

26:32.769 --> 26:35.204
* All doorbells
sing, sing, sing. *

26:35.304 --> 26:38.507
Yeah, I fucking know,
goddamn it!

26:39.275 --> 26:42.411
Hey, Kyle.
Oh, man, this is crazy, huh?

26:42.511 --> 26:45.147
The school is all filled up
and the motels are shut down.

26:45.247 --> 26:47.049
I was, I was just hoping
maybe we could crash here.

26:47.149 --> 26:50.086
Look, I, uh,
I don't think that's gonna work.

26:50.186 --> 26:52.421
I figured Stan is probably
staying with you, too?

26:52.521 --> 26:53.756
No. No, he's not.

26:53.856 --> 26:56.025
Oh, great!
Then you have some extra rooms.

26:56.125 --> 26:58.928
-We're gonna be okay, kids!
-KIDS: Yay!

26:59.028 --> 27:00.329
No, no, Cartman,
I'm sure there are

27:00.429 --> 27:01.898
some other places you can stay.

27:01.998 --> 27:03.399
My family would be
really comfortable

27:03.499 --> 27:06.602
in a nice Jewish home.
Please, Kyle, for my kids.

27:07.536 --> 27:10.172
We promise we'll be good,
Uncle Kyle.

27:10.272 --> 27:11.774
Please, Uncle Kyle?

27:11.874 --> 27:13.910
Please,
Uncle Kyle?

27:14.010 --> 27:15.344
I can't believe this.

27:15.444 --> 27:17.313
Come on, kids!
Oh, bless you, Kyle.

27:17.413 --> 27:19.181
Don't worry,
I'll put them right to bed.

27:19.281 --> 27:21.383
You won't even know we're here.

27:21.483 --> 27:23.652
Toda raba, Uncle Kyle.

27:23.753 --> 27:25.988
That's Hebrew for "thank you."

27:30.993 --> 27:33.796
(quiet chatter)

27:33.896 --> 27:37.399
Guys, doesn't this all
seem a little too convenient?

27:37.499 --> 27:38.634
What do you mean?

27:38.735 --> 27:40.002
I mean that Kenny's death
is suspicious,

27:40.102 --> 27:42.104
he talks about people
to blame and then

27:42.204 --> 27:44.406
he suddenly dies of
some new COVID variant?

27:44.506 --> 27:46.208
You think it's a cover, Token?

27:46.308 --> 27:48.377
I think it's
definitely suspicious.

27:48.477 --> 27:51.180
Speaking of suspicious,
what do you call a trans woman

27:51.280 --> 27:53.382
that walks into
an abortion clinic?

27:54.216 --> 27:57.787
Her name is Rebecca
and she's a fantastic person.

27:58.554 --> 28:00.757
Just seems all nice
and buttoned up, doesn't it?

28:00.857 --> 28:03.125
It's a perfect cause of death
and anyone who's trying

28:03.225 --> 28:04.894
to sort it out is quarantined

28:04.994 --> 28:06.796
because one person
isn't vaccinated?

28:06.896 --> 28:09.866
It's true-- who wouldn't be
vaccinated by now?

28:09.966 --> 28:11.267
I'm certainly vaccinated.

28:11.367 --> 28:13.635
-Yeah, I'm vaccinated.
-Me, too.

28:13.736 --> 28:15.137
We're all vaccinated.

28:15.237 --> 28:19.208
Yeah, I mean, I-I think
it's a personal choice.

28:20.843 --> 28:23.179
What does that mean?
Are you vaccinated, Clyde?

28:23.279 --> 28:25.314
I'm... immunized.

28:25.414 --> 28:26.983
He's not fucking vaccinated!

28:27.083 --> 28:28.250
He's the fucking one!

28:28.350 --> 28:29.518
Hey, I just, I just

28:29.618 --> 28:31.620
need to see the research
first, you know.

28:31.720 --> 28:36.225
It's been 40 years, Clyde.
That's enough research!

28:37.626 --> 28:40.629
Alexa, set an alarm
for 7:00 a.m.

28:42.464 --> 28:46.168
Alexa,
set an alarm for 7:00 a.m.

28:46.268 --> 28:48.470
Why don't you go talk
to your father?

28:48.570 --> 28:49.671
Goddamn it.

28:49.772 --> 28:51.373
If there's some kind
of connection

28:51.473 --> 28:53.142
with your dad's farm that can
help everyone figure out

28:53.242 --> 28:56.112
what's going on,
then you need to talk to him.

28:56.212 --> 28:57.980
Can I just go to sleep, please?

28:58.080 --> 28:59.949
Oh, poor you!
Poor you!

29:00.049 --> 29:02.484
Stop being a fucking victim.
At least you get to go out

29:02.584 --> 29:05.321
and do stuff.
What do I get to do?

29:05.421 --> 29:07.990
-Okay, okay, I'm sorry.
-Oh, okay, great.

29:08.090 --> 29:09.725
You're sorry, again.

29:10.993 --> 29:12.394
By the way, I can tell you

29:12.494 --> 29:14.696
about some great deals
on headphones at Best Buy.

29:14.797 --> 29:16.298
Would you like to know more?

29:16.398 --> 29:18.801
-Sure, yes, tell me more.
-Okay.

29:18.901 --> 29:21.203
The Mark VII headphones
have a new edition coming out.

29:21.303 --> 29:23.272
Should I add that
to your shopping list?

29:23.372 --> 29:25.541
(sighs) Yes, sure,
add them to my shopping list.

29:25.641 --> 29:27.576
Okay.
I'll add Mark VII headphones

29:27.676 --> 29:30.312
from Best Buy
to your shopping list.

29:36.185 --> 29:38.054
-(Yentl moaning)
-CARTMAN: Oh, yeah.

29:38.154 --> 29:40.756
Yeah, you like that?
Yeah! Yeah!

29:40.857 --> 29:42.791
Yeah, you like how Abraham
trusted in the one true God?!

29:42.892 --> 29:46.628
-(moaning continues)
-Yeah! Oh, oh, yeah! Yeah!

29:46.728 --> 29:49.131
Goddamn it!

29:49.231 --> 29:51.300
(moaning)

29:51.400 --> 29:52.902
CARTMAN:
Oh. Shh, shh. Hang on, honey.

29:53.002 --> 29:54.436
Hang on.

29:55.571 --> 29:57.006
Yeah, yeah,
what's up, buddy?

29:57.106 --> 29:59.141
What's up
is that I am over this!

29:59.241 --> 30:00.276
What are, what are
you talking about?

30:00.376 --> 30:01.677
You know what I'm talking about!

30:01.777 --> 30:04.013
You know I can hear you
through the walls!

30:04.113 --> 30:05.647
Okay, geez, I'm sorry.

30:05.747 --> 30:07.649
Sorry I was making love
to my wife.

30:07.749 --> 30:09.085
No Jewish people have sex

30:09.185 --> 30:10.987
screaming about
their love of Abraham!

30:11.087 --> 30:12.955
You are a fucking fraud!

30:13.055 --> 30:14.323
Is everything all right?

30:14.423 --> 30:16.058
Do you know that
your husband once snuck

30:16.158 --> 30:18.360
in my room
and gave me fucking AIDS?!

30:18.460 --> 30:21.330
-I'm sorry?!
-Oh, my God, Kyle!

30:21.430 --> 30:24.400
If we are being too loud, please
don't lash out at my wife!

30:24.500 --> 30:27.236
Oh, my God. Oh, my God,
I don't know what to say.

30:27.336 --> 30:29.671
Mom, Dad, is everything okay?

30:29.771 --> 30:31.740
It's all right, kids.
Go back to bed.

30:31.840 --> 30:34.710
Kyle, obviously you have
a problem with us being here.

30:34.810 --> 30:38.080
I promise you that we will be
gone first thing in the morning.

30:38.180 --> 30:40.149
That's probably best!

30:47.323 --> 30:49.025
(rhythmic rattling)

30:49.125 --> 30:50.492
-YENTL: Oh, yeah.
-CARTMAN: Oh, yeah!

30:50.592 --> 30:52.028
-YENTL: Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah, you like how Abraham

30:52.128 --> 30:53.262
-almost sacrificed
his only son?!
-Oh, yeah!

30:53.362 --> 30:54.296
-(moans)
-CARTMAN: Yeah!

30:58.234 --> 31:00.269
Sir! Sir,
the townspeople are demanding

31:00.369 --> 31:02.071
to know when
the quarantine will end.

31:02.171 --> 31:05.174
It'll end when we get the order
that everything is safe.

31:05.274 --> 31:08.444
But, sir, the people inside
are running out of supplies.

31:08.544 --> 31:09.912
They're saying they don't
have nearly enough

31:10.012 --> 31:12.014
chin diapers and
people are starting to fight.

31:12.114 --> 31:16.986
I have strict orders not to let
anything in or out of this town.

31:17.086 --> 31:20.022
They'll just have to make do
the best they can in there.

31:20.122 --> 31:23.425
Hopefully they can
maintain some sense of humanity.

31:23.525 --> 31:25.027
SOLDIER:
We got a runner!

31:25.127 --> 31:26.996
Another one trying to get out!

31:27.096 --> 31:28.364
Please!

31:28.464 --> 31:30.732
I just need to go to
a sporting event!

31:30.832 --> 31:32.468
(gunshot)

31:34.270 --> 31:36.973
(school bell rings)

31:37.073 --> 31:39.341
(busy chatter)

31:40.276 --> 31:42.011
(yawns)

31:42.111 --> 31:44.046
(smacking lips)

31:44.146 --> 31:46.582
(toilet flushes)

31:50.819 --> 31:53.722
Hey, Clyde. Clyde, can we
talk to you for a second?

31:53.822 --> 31:54.923
Sure, what's up?

31:55.024 --> 31:57.994
Look, Clyde,
we all really respect

31:58.094 --> 32:00.562
your personal p-p-preferences.

32:00.662 --> 32:03.699
But we have things we
really need to get back to.

32:03.799 --> 32:06.702
We've got jobs a-and careers,
people who need us.

32:06.802 --> 32:08.704
B-But we're being forced
to stay here.

32:08.804 --> 32:11.807
So could you maybe just--
just get vaccinated real quick?

32:11.907 --> 32:14.276
Oh. Um...

32:14.376 --> 32:16.678
Nah. I don't wanna.

32:16.778 --> 32:18.014
(all groaning)

32:18.114 --> 32:20.516
Look, I'm sorry, guys.
It's for health reasons.

32:20.616 --> 32:23.452
I can't get vaccinated 'cause
I'm allergic to shellfish.

32:23.552 --> 32:27.389
Clyde, there's no shellfish
in the COVID vaccine.

32:27.489 --> 32:29.425
I know,
but I read that sometimes

32:29.525 --> 32:31.327
in the lab where the vaccine
is made,

32:31.427 --> 32:33.195
if somebody ate shellfish,

32:33.295 --> 32:34.696
then it can
get cross-contaminated

32:34.796 --> 32:37.666
and have leftover
residual shellfish-ness.

32:37.766 --> 32:40.436
So you're saying you
won't take the COVID vaccine

32:40.536 --> 32:42.171
out of shellfish-ness.

32:42.271 --> 32:43.605
Yes, that is correct.

32:43.705 --> 32:46.242
Just a general sense
of shellfish-ness.

32:46.342 --> 32:49.011
Everyone, you better
come check this out.

32:50.512 --> 32:51.647
Look at this.

32:51.747 --> 32:54.016
CRAIG:
The McCormick Science Wing

32:54.116 --> 32:56.185
at South Park Elementary.

32:56.285 --> 32:58.254
Yeah, so? I read about this.

32:58.354 --> 32:59.555
Kenny donated tons of money

32:59.655 --> 33:01.290
to build a science center
for the students.

33:01.390 --> 33:02.758
Yeah, for the students.

33:02.858 --> 33:04.826
So why does it
have a lock on it?

33:04.926 --> 33:07.029
* *

33:07.129 --> 33:08.230
(banging)

33:08.330 --> 33:10.566
(chain rattles)

33:16.772 --> 33:19.608
WENDY: This must be where Kenny
was doing all his research.

33:19.708 --> 33:23.212
He didn't want to be found,
so he used the school as cover.

33:23.312 --> 33:27.383
Uh, guys, why is there
blood everywhere?

33:28.717 --> 33:30.219
Everybody see what you can find.

33:30.319 --> 33:33.355
There's got to be a clue here
of who killed Kenny.

33:35.324 --> 33:37.226
(electronic drumbeat playing)

33:37.326 --> 33:39.061
* In the future *

33:39.895 --> 33:42.831
* We are living in the future *

33:43.599 --> 33:44.766
* It's the future. *

33:44.866 --> 33:46.068
(music stops)

33:49.705 --> 33:52.074
MALE VOICE: And we are the
fastest growing retirement home

33:52.174 --> 33:54.843
in Park County.
With our newest tower,

33:54.943 --> 33:58.247
we can now house over
600,000 old people.

33:58.347 --> 34:03.285
'Cause in the future you're old
for a long, long time.

34:03.385 --> 34:06.988
(indistinct chatter, grumbling)

34:07.089 --> 34:10.326
(pained groaning)

34:10.426 --> 34:11.727
Can I help you?

34:11.827 --> 34:15.464
My name is Stan Marsh.
I came to...

34:15.564 --> 34:17.799
visit my dad.

34:17.899 --> 34:19.268
(knocking)

34:19.368 --> 34:22.971
Mr. Marsh.
Mr. Marsh, guess what.

34:23.071 --> 34:25.006
Your son is here.

34:26.975 --> 34:28.877
I don't have a son.

34:28.977 --> 34:33.149
Oh, come on, Mr. Marsh,
don't be a grumpy pants.

34:33.249 --> 34:36.318
You tell that piece of shit
that if he wants to

34:36.418 --> 34:38.787
talk to me,
he can write an email.

34:38.887 --> 34:41.690
Tell that little pussy
if I had any grandkids,

34:41.790 --> 34:43.659
maybe I wouldn't be so bitter

34:43.759 --> 34:46.295
at having such a little bitch
for a son!

34:46.395 --> 34:49.131
-Hi, Dad.
-Oh, hey, Stan.

34:49.231 --> 34:51.567
I'll leave you two alone.

34:56.071 --> 34:59.908
So, looks like
the Broncos still suck.

35:00.008 --> 35:01.377
Yup.

35:03.345 --> 35:04.646
Well, it was nice seeing ya.

35:04.746 --> 35:06.182
Thanks for coming to visit.

35:06.282 --> 35:07.549
I didn't come to visit.

35:07.649 --> 35:09.251
Trust me,
I don't want to be here.

35:09.351 --> 35:12.654
Right, like you didn't
want to murder your sister.

35:12.754 --> 35:15.591
What happened to Shelley
was your fault, not mine!

35:15.691 --> 35:18.660
Yeah, like it was my fault
your mom shot herself!

35:18.760 --> 35:20.696
Yes, it actually was!

35:20.796 --> 35:24.400
Your mom died the day
her daughter burned to death!

35:26.368 --> 35:28.970
I'm just here because of Kenny.

35:29.070 --> 35:32.441
Why would he have
Tegridy Weed in his equations?

35:35.711 --> 35:37.779
Dr. McCormick mentioned Tegridy?

35:37.879 --> 35:41.183
It seemed to somehow fit
into some grand theory he had.

35:41.283 --> 35:44.953
He knew. He knew
it was the way to fix it all.

35:45.053 --> 35:49.958
He knew...
about the Pandemic Special.

35:52.761 --> 35:55.697
But, Mom,
why do we have to leave?

35:55.797 --> 35:57.333
It's not safe outside!

35:57.433 --> 35:58.834
We aren't welcome here,
children.

35:58.934 --> 36:00.836
We have to find another
place to stay.

36:00.936 --> 36:02.871
Oh, no, this is just like
when our people were

36:02.971 --> 36:04.940
exiled from the Holy Lands.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.209
Mrs. Cartman,
can I talk to you, please?

36:07.309 --> 36:09.211
-Uncle Kyle!
-Uncle Kyle,

36:09.311 --> 36:11.480
why are you making us go? Why?

36:11.580 --> 36:13.048
Is it 'cause we're Jews?

36:13.148 --> 36:16.352
Mrs. Cartman,
I'm sorry for last night.

36:16.452 --> 36:21.557
I was just... tired and it was
extremely inappropriate of me.

36:21.657 --> 36:22.591
BOTH:
Dad!

36:22.691 --> 36:23.892
I think Uncle Kyle

36:23.992 --> 36:25.794
is gonna let us stay, Papa!

36:25.894 --> 36:30.432
Uh, no, kids, I'm sorry, but we
can't stay here with Uncle Kyle.

36:30.532 --> 36:34.069
Please stay.
I am asking you to stay.

36:34.169 --> 36:36.472
Can we, Dad?
We'll be good, we promise!

36:36.572 --> 36:38.807
You little ones are always good.

36:38.907 --> 36:42.511
* Mik-helm, Mik-helm,
mit cloiska pudding *

36:42.611 --> 36:44.946
* Vil plotz vit laughter, too *

36:45.046 --> 36:46.081
Stop it!

36:46.181 --> 36:47.249
(doorbell rings)

36:47.349 --> 36:49.585
* Someone is at the door! *

36:49.685 --> 36:53.389
-* Yeah! This is the doorbell! *
-(yells)

36:53.489 --> 36:55.424
* It is the future! *

36:55.524 --> 36:57.393
They killed Kenny...

36:57.493 --> 36:59.561
because he was
trying to stop it.

36:59.661 --> 37:01.430
Stop what?

37:01.530 --> 37:02.964
We found Kenny's lab.

37:03.064 --> 37:06.034
All of his confidential work
and his wild experiments.

37:06.134 --> 37:09.805
Kenny wasn't just trying to find
the source of the coronavirus.

37:09.905 --> 37:11.840
He was trying
to go back in time,

37:11.940 --> 37:14.443
and stop the pandemic
from ever happening.

37:14.543 --> 37:16.878
* *

37:16.978 --> 37:20.215
(woman speaking Japanese)

37:20.316 --> 37:22.117
Okay, old people.

37:22.217 --> 37:24.453
It's 4:00.
You know what that means.

37:24.553 --> 37:26.322
It's share time!

37:26.422 --> 37:27.989
(all grumbling)

37:28.089 --> 37:30.191
Who has something that they
want to share?

37:30.292 --> 37:31.493
Mr. Garrison?

37:31.593 --> 37:34.496
I'd like to share
my dick in your mouth.

37:34.596 --> 37:37.699
-(laughter)
-M'kay.

37:37.799 --> 37:40.001
Okay, guys, let's settle down.

37:40.101 --> 37:43.505
Look, I know sharing feelings is
hard during this time of crisis.

37:43.605 --> 37:46.642
Is anyone feeling nervous
about the new COVID outbreak?

37:46.742 --> 37:48.710
(grumbling)

37:48.810 --> 37:51.079
We don't want you to worry,
because, you know,

37:51.179 --> 37:53.515
it's the future--
we all do everything we can

37:53.615 --> 37:55.517
to make sure
old people don't die.

37:55.617 --> 37:57.085
(all groaning)

37:57.185 --> 37:59.154
Okay, if nobody else
wants to go first,

37:59.254 --> 38:01.122
Randy Marsh had
a little visitor today

38:01.222 --> 38:03.692
and he'd like to share that
with all of you.

38:03.792 --> 38:07.863
Uh, hey, everyone. I had
a special visitor today.

38:07.963 --> 38:09.498
My "son."

38:09.598 --> 38:12.233
Who hasn't come to see me
in over 20 years.

38:12.334 --> 38:14.570
And I have some things
I need to tell him

38:14.670 --> 38:16.505
but it's hard because...

38:16.605 --> 38:18.039
he killed his mom
and his sister.

38:18.139 --> 38:20.509
Okay, okay,
here's what happened.

38:20.609 --> 38:21.943
Oh, here we go, here we go.

38:22.043 --> 38:24.413
After the pandemic,
my mom wanted a divorce

38:24.513 --> 38:26.214
and she owned half of the farm.

38:26.314 --> 38:28.717
She didn't own half,
she always hated weed,

38:28.817 --> 38:30.285
and she didn't do shit
for the farm.

38:30.386 --> 38:32.888
He wouldn't give her half
the farm, so I got sick

38:32.988 --> 38:34.222
of their fighting
and decided to burn

38:34.322 --> 38:36.057
the whole stupid farm
to the ground.

38:36.157 --> 38:38.827
And his sister was in the barn
and she burned to death.

38:38.927 --> 38:41.062
Because you locked her
in the barn 'cause she wouldn't

38:41.162 --> 38:43.799
do her weed chores
'cause she hated weed, too!

38:43.899 --> 38:46.001
Yes, she had
a marijuana problem.

38:46.101 --> 38:48.537
And so his mother
couldn't take the loss

38:48.637 --> 38:50.572
of Shelley
and so she killed herself!

38:50.672 --> 38:52.273
Which is your fault.

38:52.374 --> 38:53.642
You were the one who

38:53.742 --> 38:54.876
burned the family business
to the ground.

38:54.976 --> 38:56.378
You guys are hearing this,
right?

38:58.447 --> 39:02.283
So, Kenny spends years
researching time travel,

39:02.384 --> 39:04.185
then suddenly Kenny dies,

39:04.285 --> 39:06.655
and all his fellow
scientists go missing.

39:06.755 --> 39:09.391
Just leaving behind
a trail of blood.

39:09.491 --> 39:11.727
Seems like all of
the scientists were murdered

39:11.827 --> 39:14.262
so that nobody could
complete Kenny's work.

39:14.362 --> 39:15.764
All of them except one.

39:15.864 --> 39:17.666
In almost all this research,

39:17.766 --> 39:21.302
one name keeps popping up:
Victor Chouce.

39:21.403 --> 39:24.473
It appears that Chouce
was Kenny's right-hand man.

39:24.573 --> 39:26.141
But he was insane.

39:26.241 --> 39:28.276
He's been locked up for years
inside a mental institution.

39:28.376 --> 39:30.612
Oh, come on.
Now we're gonna start talking

39:30.712 --> 39:32.280
to certifiably crazy people?

39:32.380 --> 39:35.283
Crazy or not,
we find this Victor Chouce

39:35.383 --> 39:38.286
and we find where
Kenny hid the information.

39:38.386 --> 39:40.422
* *

39:42.190 --> 39:44.426
(crazed chatter and wailing)

39:46.027 --> 39:47.496
WARDEN (echoes):
Yes.

39:47.596 --> 39:49.197
Yes, that is correct.

39:49.297 --> 39:52.200
Victor Chouce is
one of our patients here.

39:52.300 --> 39:54.770
What is the nature
of your inquiry?

39:54.870 --> 39:57.439
We have reason to believe
that Victor Chouce

39:57.539 --> 40:00.341
can answer questions
regarding our friend's death.

40:00.442 --> 40:02.377
Could you put him
on the line please?

40:02.478 --> 40:04.646
I'm afraid that's impossible.

40:04.746 --> 40:09.017
Victor is too unstable for
phone calls. They confuse him.

40:09.117 --> 40:12.087
Well, can we come
talk to him in person then?

40:13.154 --> 40:15.691
Yes, I believe
that could be arranged.

40:15.791 --> 40:18.727
As long as
the proper protocols are met.

40:18.827 --> 40:22.030
Is everyone
in your party vaccinated?

40:23.599 --> 40:24.866
No.

40:24.966 --> 40:26.935
Well, then
I'm afraid we can't allow you

40:27.035 --> 40:28.436
into our facility.

40:28.537 --> 40:31.640
But-but we have to talk to him!
It's urgent!

40:31.740 --> 40:32.908
What'd they say?

40:33.008 --> 40:34.309
They're not
gonna let us see him!

40:34.409 --> 40:37.112
It's some kind of
goddamn conspiracy!

40:38.580 --> 40:42.317
(woman speaking Japanese)

40:47.055 --> 40:48.890
Listen to me, it's very simple.

40:48.990 --> 40:51.326
I need to take my dad
out of here.

40:51.426 --> 40:52.561
He has to come with me.

40:52.661 --> 40:54.429
I'm afraid that's impossible.

40:54.530 --> 40:57.098
Senior citizens are
in here to keep them safe.

40:57.198 --> 41:00.802
You know, it's the future--
we can't let old people die.

41:00.902 --> 41:03.338
-I told you, stupid.
-Shut up, Dad.

41:03.438 --> 41:06.274
Look, there's a chance we
can help fight this new variant.

41:06.374 --> 41:08.243
I just need him out for
a couple hours

41:08.343 --> 41:09.745
so we can
get something important.

41:09.845 --> 41:11.312
Well, why don't you
just go get it?

41:11.412 --> 41:13.582
Because he won't tell me
where it is because

41:13.682 --> 41:16.384
-he doesn't trust me.
-Because he killed his mom.

41:17.152 --> 41:19.320
Look, I'm sorry,
but this is the future.

41:19.420 --> 41:22.257
Nothing is more important than
keeping old people alive.

41:22.357 --> 41:23.925
What if you took him out there
and, God forbid,

41:24.025 --> 41:25.360
he crapped his pants?

41:25.460 --> 41:26.895
And then slipped on
the old people diarrhea

41:26.995 --> 41:28.296
and hit his head?

41:28.396 --> 41:29.631
We'd have to shut down
the entire country,

41:29.731 --> 41:30.699
for Christ's sake.

41:30.799 --> 41:32.668
Well, I guess that's it.

41:32.768 --> 41:35.236
Only one way out now.

41:38.574 --> 41:39.975
Kick him in the balls, Stan!

41:40.075 --> 41:41.442
-What?!
-Kick him in the balls!

41:41.543 --> 41:43.779
-Come on, hurry!
-Get your hands off of me!

41:43.879 --> 41:45.413
-Dad!
-Goddamn it, Stan,

41:45.513 --> 41:48.416
kick his fucking balls
so we can go!

41:48.516 --> 41:49.951
-Fuck!
-(groans)

41:50.051 --> 41:53.955
Okay, grab his keys!
Grab his keys, you stupid ass!

41:55.023 --> 41:57.693
(coughing and groaning)

41:57.793 --> 41:59.260
(alert beeping)

41:59.360 --> 42:02.430
FEMALE VOICE: Warning. Warning.
Old person has escaped.

42:02.530 --> 42:05.667
Old person has escaped.
Warning.

42:05.767 --> 42:08.503
(woman speaking Japanese)

42:08.604 --> 42:10.371
(alarm blaring)

42:12.540 --> 42:15.110
(sirens wailing)

42:15.210 --> 42:16.978
All of these documents
we found in Kenny's lab

42:17.078 --> 42:19.815
referred to possible origins
of the coronavirus.

42:19.915 --> 42:21.750
He wanted to go back
and stop it.

42:21.850 --> 42:24.686
But to stop it, he had to
figure out how to bend time.

42:24.786 --> 42:28.657
Exactly. There's notes--
years and years of research

42:28.757 --> 42:30.058
that Kenny compiled--

42:30.158 --> 42:32.227
all on the possibilities
of time travel.

42:32.327 --> 42:34.295
CARTMAN (giggling):
You silly girl.

42:34.395 --> 42:37.165
You, yes.
Who's a little mister, yes.

42:37.265 --> 42:38.700
Who's a little hetzpah?

42:38.800 --> 42:40.301
Who's my little meshugana?

42:40.401 --> 42:41.837
Excuse me!

42:41.937 --> 42:43.438
Geez, sorry, Kyle.

42:43.538 --> 42:45.841
Kenny was researching
the nature of space-time

42:45.941 --> 42:48.076
to see if some kind
of bending was possible.

42:48.176 --> 42:51.079
But then suddenly, all
the research just gets cut off.

42:51.179 --> 42:53.048
Because whoever
made the pandemic happen

42:53.148 --> 42:55.316
killed Kenny before
he could go back and stop it.

42:55.416 --> 42:57.686
CARTMAN (giggling):
Silly girl. Yes.

42:57.786 --> 42:59.888
Will you please knock it off?!

42:59.988 --> 43:01.489
What's the problem, Kyle?

43:01.589 --> 43:03.424
You know what you're doing,
fat-ass!

43:03.524 --> 43:06.194
Goddamn it, why don't you lay
off my fuckin' dad, Uncle Kyle!

43:06.294 --> 43:08.930
Moisha! He's never
talked like that before.

43:09.030 --> 43:10.231
I'm sorry, Mom. It's just...

43:10.331 --> 43:12.600
Uncle Kyle,
he makes me so crazy!

43:12.701 --> 43:14.469
That is not okay, Moisha.

43:14.569 --> 43:18.273
But it's true, Dad.
Uncle Kyle makes me crazy, too!

43:18.373 --> 43:20.709
-(scoffs) Menorah!
-Fuck you, Kyle.

43:20.809 --> 43:22.778
(gasps) Hackelm!

43:22.878 --> 43:24.746
You guys, listen.
In Kenny's work

43:24.846 --> 43:27.448
he talks about where he would
hide important information.

43:27.548 --> 43:29.885
He says his friends
will always know where to look

43:29.985 --> 43:32.620
if they just
think like kids again.

43:33.621 --> 43:35.657
Think like kids again...

43:36.725 --> 43:39.527
I know where Kenny hid
what we're looking for.

43:39.627 --> 43:41.897
It's up his ass.

43:47.535 --> 43:49.037
Who's the broad?

43:49.137 --> 43:51.239
That's just my Alexa.

43:52.107 --> 43:53.608
That's the best
you could do, huh?

43:53.709 --> 43:54.910
Is it even the new one?

43:55.010 --> 43:57.445
-Excuse me?
-Just ignore him.

43:58.313 --> 44:00.348
Okay, fine, there's a new
upgrade available

44:00.448 --> 44:01.983
for your Amazon Prime
membership.

44:02.083 --> 44:03.451
Would you like to know more?

44:03.551 --> 44:04.886
Not now, please.

44:04.986 --> 44:07.655
Okay, so I guess
just fuck me, then?

44:09.424 --> 44:11.326
Uh-huh.

44:14.996 --> 44:16.431
(car beeps)

44:20.902 --> 44:23.138
* *

44:27.608 --> 44:30.245
This was once
such a magical place.

44:30.345 --> 44:32.080
Can we just get this over with?

44:32.180 --> 44:33.648
I don't want to be here.

44:33.749 --> 44:35.250
You think I want to be here?

44:35.350 --> 44:38.319
This is where I lost
everything that I cared about!

44:38.419 --> 44:40.488
And your mom and your sister!

44:46.995 --> 44:49.030
Dad, there's nothing here.

44:50.031 --> 44:51.199
Dad?

44:51.299 --> 44:52.934
I think I can
trust you now, Stan.

44:53.034 --> 44:56.838
It's time for you to learn what
your friend Kenny was after.

44:56.938 --> 45:00.208
When the pandemic started,
you were only a kid.

45:00.308 --> 45:03.644
You don't remember the pain
we all went through.

45:03.745 --> 45:04.980
Yeah, I do.

45:05.080 --> 45:07.883
We as Americans
went through so much.

45:07.983 --> 45:12.220
First, that incompetent
jack-hole was elected president.

45:12.320 --> 45:15.723
Then the pandemic came,
and then the race wars.

45:15.824 --> 45:19.795
And then just when it seemed
like we'd turned a corner,

45:19.895 --> 45:25.200
Space Jam 2 came out,
and we all just kind of gave up.

45:25.300 --> 45:28.703
What we lost,
Stan, was our Tegridy.

45:28.804 --> 45:30.906
But it was all by design.

45:31.006 --> 45:32.974
They needed us to lose it.

45:33.074 --> 45:34.242
Who did?

45:34.342 --> 45:36.878
Who would want us
to lose our optimism

45:36.978 --> 45:39.314
and start fighting
with each other?

45:39.414 --> 45:40.215
China.

45:40.315 --> 45:43.251
-China?
-China.

45:43.351 --> 45:45.486
They're the superpower now.

45:45.586 --> 45:48.456
The future is totally theirs
and we let it happen.

45:48.556 --> 45:51.092
A man in China
had sex with a pangolin

45:51.192 --> 45:54.062
and that started COVID.
That man was me.

45:54.162 --> 45:55.596
So I knew how to go back

45:55.696 --> 45:57.098
and stop them
from taking over...

45:57.198 --> 45:58.800
Wait, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait, wait.

45:58.900 --> 46:00.501
You started COVID?

46:00.601 --> 46:02.503
Yes, but that's
besides the point.

46:02.603 --> 46:04.840
China used me
like they used us all.

46:04.940 --> 46:07.909
So I came up with a way
to help everyone fight back.

46:08.009 --> 46:10.311
A special Tegridy weed.

46:11.279 --> 46:12.747
You had sex with a pangolin

46:12.848 --> 46:15.683
in China and started
the whole pandemic?!

46:15.783 --> 46:17.919
Will you listen
to what I'm saying?!

46:18.019 --> 46:20.721
Gal!
I worked to create more Tegridy,

46:20.822 --> 46:23.591
but China did everything
they could to stop me.

46:23.691 --> 46:25.326
They even got to my son.

46:25.426 --> 46:28.329
Who burned all of
Tegridy Farms to the ground.

46:28.429 --> 46:30.665
But what you didn't even know

46:30.765 --> 46:34.069
was that I had secretly
created a new strain of weed.

46:34.169 --> 46:38.173
A weed so powerful, I couldn't
even call it a special.

46:38.273 --> 46:40.375
It was more like an event.

46:40.475 --> 46:43.011
I hid it away all these years.

46:43.111 --> 46:47.715
And now it... is the key
to saving us all.

46:50.585 --> 46:52.453
(whirring)

46:57.358 --> 46:59.327
-Where the fuck is it?
-What?

46:59.427 --> 47:02.597
The Tegridy Weed Special Event!
Where the fuck is it?!

47:02.697 --> 47:04.165
I don't know, Dad!

47:04.265 --> 47:06.601
They got it. They took it!

47:06.701 --> 47:08.536
There's even fresh
footprints on the ground!

47:08.636 --> 47:10.138
Oh, Jesus!

47:10.238 --> 47:12.273
So maybe it wasn't the Chinese.

47:12.373 --> 47:16.377
Yeah, no, it was definitely
the Chinese. Oh, God.

47:16.477 --> 47:20.048
That was it! That was
the very last bit of Tegridy!

47:20.148 --> 47:22.984
The only other thing I had
were some seeds that I hid

47:23.084 --> 47:26.922
up my ass, but they took them
from me at the old folks home!

47:27.022 --> 47:28.990
Wait a minute.
What did you say?

47:29.090 --> 47:32.093
I said they took them from me
at the old folks home.

47:32.193 --> 47:33.294
No, before that.

47:33.394 --> 47:36.764
Oh. I said I hid 'em
up my ass.

47:36.864 --> 47:41.002
Jesus. It's so simple.
How did we not get it?

47:41.102 --> 47:43.138
Alexa, start the car!

47:44.072 --> 47:46.307
There's no point now, son!

47:46.407 --> 47:48.209
It's all gone.

47:48.309 --> 47:51.512
It's all lost. All lost.

47:51.612 --> 47:54.749
VOICE (whispering):
Randy.

47:54.849 --> 47:57.785
Randy.

47:57.885 --> 48:00.021
Ah...?

48:00.121 --> 48:02.590
MAN (over P.A.):
ICU, please. Blue Team, ICU.

48:04.459 --> 48:07.228
(indistinct chatter)

48:08.729 --> 48:10.698
"Un-cle Kyle."

48:12.200 --> 48:15.803
"Uncle Kyle."
Say it, Hackelm.

48:17.072 --> 48:21.109
-"Uncle Kyle."
-Fuck you, Kyle.

48:21.209 --> 48:24.812
No, no, no.
"Uncle Kyle."

48:24.912 --> 48:26.181
Fuck you, Kyle.

48:26.281 --> 48:28.283
CARTMAN:
Oh, my gosh, no.

48:28.383 --> 48:30.318
We're so sorry about this.

48:30.418 --> 48:33.121
CARTMAN:
Hackelm, say "Uncle."

48:33.221 --> 48:37.792
"Uncle. Uncle Kyle."

48:38.859 --> 48:40.761
Fuck you, Uncle Kyle!

48:40.861 --> 48:42.163
Hey, that was better.

48:42.263 --> 48:44.099
It isn't gonna work.
The hospital says

48:44.199 --> 48:46.134
we don't have authorization
to see Kenny's remains.

48:46.234 --> 48:47.435
What?!

48:47.535 --> 48:49.070
Sounds like someone
doesn't want us

48:49.170 --> 48:51.539
to see Kenny's remains.
'Cause we might find the truth.

48:51.639 --> 48:53.474
There has to be
a way for us to get in there.

48:53.574 --> 48:55.843
-Ha ha. Fuck you, Uncle Kyle!
-Hackelm.

48:55.943 --> 48:58.179
STAN: What the hell
are you guys doing here?

48:58.846 --> 49:00.948
-Stan?
-What are you doing here?

49:01.049 --> 49:03.451
I've been trying to
find out who killed Kenny.

49:03.551 --> 49:06.054
I think I know where he
stored the information.

49:06.154 --> 49:07.255
BOTH:
It's in his asshole.

49:07.355 --> 49:08.689
-Yes.
-Well, it doesn't matter.

49:08.789 --> 49:10.291
They won't let us
into the morgue.

49:10.391 --> 49:12.027
Yeah, that's because
you guys don't think.

49:12.127 --> 49:13.394
Excuse me?
We need to examine

49:13.494 --> 49:15.430
the remains of Dr. McCormick
right away.

49:15.530 --> 49:17.065
Like I told the others,

49:17.165 --> 49:20.001
only certified medical personnel
are allowed to examine cadavers.

49:20.101 --> 49:21.702
Stan Marsh, consultant

49:21.802 --> 49:24.639
for Post-Modem Beveragetainment
Online Services.

49:25.873 --> 49:27.875
One moment, Doctor.

49:27.975 --> 49:29.677
This is highly unorthodox.

49:29.777 --> 49:32.147
We don't normally allow
outsiders into the morgue.

49:32.247 --> 49:36.251
That's understandable, Doctor,
but luckily I am orthodox.

49:36.351 --> 49:38.386
I don't think this
is suitable for children.

49:38.486 --> 49:40.721
You guys go.
You were the closest to him.

49:40.821 --> 49:42.857
We'll stay back
and watch the kids.

49:44.859 --> 49:46.627
I'm sorry we can't
supply any chin diapers.

49:46.727 --> 49:48.629
Just maintain social distance.

49:48.729 --> 49:50.398
Middle cabinet,
second from the bottom.

49:50.498 --> 49:52.733
* *

50:07.448 --> 50:09.117
Hello, old friend.

50:09.217 --> 50:10.851
(rats squeaking)

50:10.951 --> 50:12.420
Ah, come on!

50:15.423 --> 50:17.292
Well, let's get him...

50:17.392 --> 50:18.759
turned over.

50:23.464 --> 50:24.732
Somebody's got to look.

50:24.832 --> 50:26.501
I'm not reaching up Kenny's ass.

50:26.601 --> 50:28.035
Well, somebody has to.

50:28.136 --> 50:29.604
-Cartman, go ahead.
-No, I can't do it.

50:29.704 --> 50:30.938
If anyone should reach up
Kenny's ass,

50:31.038 --> 50:32.373
it should be you, Kyle.

50:32.473 --> 50:34.109
I thought you were
his fucking "best friend."

50:34.209 --> 50:37.078
I was his best friend,
but I am also married,

50:37.178 --> 50:39.514
so I can't be fingering
people's buttholes.

50:39.614 --> 50:41.949
God, you guys fucking suck.
I'll just do it.

50:42.049 --> 50:44.219
Just like I always had to
fix fucking everything else!

50:44.319 --> 50:46.421
(rats squeaking)

50:47.255 --> 50:48.689
(squishing)

50:50.057 --> 50:51.992
You did not
"fucking fix everything,"

50:52.093 --> 50:54.829
you just started acting like
everyone else was stupid.

50:54.929 --> 50:57.765
Oh, really? Because
they were acting stupid?

50:57.865 --> 51:00.168
Yeah, because you got all
self-righteous about everything.

51:00.268 --> 51:02.603
-I got self-righteous?
-Yeah, you got self-righteous.

51:02.703 --> 51:04.639
Do you know what
fucking sanctimonious means?

51:04.739 --> 51:06.641
No, Kyle, why don't you
fucking tell me

51:06.741 --> 51:08.343
what fucking
sanctimonious means.

51:08.443 --> 51:09.844
See, this is exactly
how you acted when

51:09.944 --> 51:11.612
-the pandemic started to...
-Wait!

51:11.712 --> 51:12.680
Hold on.

51:12.780 --> 51:15.116
-(squishing)
-We've got it.

51:19.354 --> 51:20.821
-Oh, my God.
-What?

51:20.921 --> 51:24.091
It's got shit on it.
That's dead people shit.

51:25.092 --> 51:27.362
(retches)

51:29.964 --> 51:31.566
What are you working on, Clyde?

51:31.666 --> 51:33.568
I'm going through
Kenny's journals again

51:33.668 --> 51:35.136
to try to find some answers.

51:35.236 --> 51:37.938
Seems like we just keep hitting
dead ends, you know?

51:38.038 --> 51:40.241
I'm just tired
and I want to go home.

51:40.341 --> 51:42.843
I know. I'm exhausted, too.

51:45.480 --> 51:48.249
You want to maybe
do a little bump?

51:48.349 --> 51:49.484
Huh?

51:49.584 --> 51:50.851
I was just--

51:50.951 --> 51:53.454
I've got some coke
and I thought we could...

51:53.554 --> 51:55.723
I don't know,
do you want to party?

51:56.657 --> 51:58.259
Fuck yes, I want to party.

51:58.359 --> 51:59.760
-Really?
-Fuck yes.

51:59.860 --> 52:01.662
Oh, I'm so glad you're down.

52:01.762 --> 52:03.731
Nobody else is even cool enough
for me to ask.

52:03.831 --> 52:05.466
It's pretty good shit, too.

52:05.566 --> 52:08.603
(sniffing)
Oh, man. Thank God.

52:08.703 --> 52:09.870
Thank God I brought this.
Here ya go.

52:09.970 --> 52:12.673
Fuck yes.
Let's fucking party.

52:13.974 --> 52:15.109
Wait a minute.

52:16.010 --> 52:18.279
-What is this really?
-What do you mean?

52:18.379 --> 52:21.516
This isn't cocaine, it's
the COVID vaccine, isn't it?!

52:21.616 --> 52:24.151
I'm not putting
that shit in my body!

52:24.252 --> 52:25.886
Forget it, guys, it didn't work.

52:25.986 --> 52:27.355
(all groaning)

52:27.455 --> 52:30.124
You guys were gonna trick me
into taking the vaccine?!

52:30.225 --> 52:32.327
Goddamn it, Clyde,
we want to get out of here!

52:32.427 --> 52:35.563
My body is a temple
and I'm not taking that shit!

52:35.663 --> 52:37.798
Let's just face it, guys,
it's over.

52:37.898 --> 52:40.134
We're never going to find
what Kenny was after.

52:40.235 --> 52:42.437
Whoever controls the world
and killed our friend

52:42.537 --> 52:44.104
is just gonna get away with it.

52:44.205 --> 52:45.706
KYLE:
Not so fast!

52:47.942 --> 52:51.312
We did it! We found Kenny's
hidden information!

52:51.412 --> 52:53.248
-You did?
-And now we can finally

52:53.348 --> 52:54.249
learn the truth!

52:54.349 --> 52:55.650
Whoever Kenny was after,

52:55.750 --> 52:58.219
we are gonna
take those fuckers down!

52:58.319 --> 52:59.587
(beeps)

52:59.687 --> 53:01.556
(static crackles)

53:01.656 --> 53:05.860
The date is November 3rd.
It is 2:07 p.m.

53:05.960 --> 53:08.296
Dr. Kenneth McCormick
will now be

53:08.396 --> 53:10.331
attempting to travel back
in time.

53:10.431 --> 53:14.469
In order to stop the COVID
pandemic from ever happening.

53:15.270 --> 53:16.170
He did it?

53:16.271 --> 53:17.638
Dr. McCormick believes

53:17.738 --> 53:18.639
that going back

53:18.739 --> 53:20.107
is the only way

53:20.207 --> 53:22.810
to stop the people
who have ruined the future.

53:22.910 --> 53:25.413
In the event of
Dr. McCormick's death,

53:25.513 --> 53:27.315
he wants everyone
to know the group

53:27.415 --> 53:29.784
that is responsible
for the way things are.

53:29.884 --> 53:32.487
It is,
"My three dickhead friends,

53:32.587 --> 53:34.989
Stan, Kyle and Cartman."

53:35.990 --> 53:36.724
What?!

53:36.824 --> 53:38.526
Dr. McCormick says

53:38.626 --> 53:40.728
that these three
completely ruined everything

53:40.828 --> 53:43.097
when they let COVID
break up their friendship

53:43.197 --> 53:46.401
and became argumentative,
combative, pessimistic assholes.

53:46.501 --> 53:49.003
(muffled muttering)

53:49.103 --> 53:51.005
He says he hopes
you guys are watching this.

53:51.105 --> 53:55.009
(muffled shouting)

53:55.910 --> 53:58.212
He spent his whole life
trying to fix your broship

53:58.313 --> 54:00.214
and then realized
this was the only way,

54:00.315 --> 54:01.682
'cause you guys suck.

54:01.782 --> 54:04.385
-(loud zapping)
-The sequence is active!

54:04.485 --> 54:06.554
The historic moment is here!

54:06.654 --> 54:08.356
Godspeed, Dr. McCormick!

54:08.456 --> 54:09.857
(zapping continues)

54:09.957 --> 54:13.160
Wait! Dr. McCormick,
you forgot your chin diaper!

54:13.260 --> 54:14.395
(alarm blaring)

54:14.495 --> 54:16.030
Something's wrong!

54:16.130 --> 54:18.633
-(explosions)
-(electronic trilling)

54:19.400 --> 54:21.302
(shouting)

54:38.386 --> 54:41.021
(coughing)

54:43.424 --> 54:46.160
All this time,
the bad guys we were after,

54:46.260 --> 54:50.865
who Kenny said ruined
the future, was you guys?

54:50.965 --> 54:53.167
Wendy, I've been trying
not to say anything but...

54:53.267 --> 54:56.170
your friends are all
kind of douchebags.

54:58.072 --> 55:00.107
* *

55:00.207 --> 55:01.509
Kenny was right.

55:01.609 --> 55:03.678
All this time,
we've been trying to figure out

55:03.778 --> 55:06.347
whose fault this all was.

55:06.447 --> 55:08.282
It was our fault.

55:08.383 --> 55:10.518
I remember when we were kids.

55:10.618 --> 55:13.087
We were so optimistic.

55:13.187 --> 55:16.857
We lost that.
We lost our sense of fun.

55:16.957 --> 55:19.226
Our sense of humor.

55:19.326 --> 55:22.229
Maybe the pandemic
was a big test.

55:22.329 --> 55:24.765
And we all failed.

55:24.865 --> 55:27.301
Let's face it, guys.

55:27.402 --> 55:29.336
We killed Kenny.

55:32.607 --> 55:34.141
Yeah. Kenny was right.

55:34.241 --> 55:36.911
Back in the old days,
we wouldn't give up like this.

55:37.011 --> 55:38.813
We would have just set out
to save our friend,

55:38.913 --> 55:40.881
no matter how impossible
it seemed.

55:40.981 --> 55:42.850
What we would have done--

55:42.950 --> 55:44.485
and what we
should have done then--

55:44.585 --> 55:46.387
was double down on our respect

55:46.487 --> 55:49.156
and our love for one another
and fight through it

55:49.256 --> 55:51.592
instead of
fighting with each other.

55:51.692 --> 55:53.327
We can save Kenny.

55:53.428 --> 55:55.062
We just have to finish his work.

55:55.162 --> 55:57.665
How? We don't know anything
about quantum physics

55:57.765 --> 55:59.266
and time travel.

55:59.366 --> 56:02.837
I don't know how.
But we start by believing.

56:02.937 --> 56:05.773
In each other
and in what is yet to come.

56:05.873 --> 56:09.309
We have to go back to being
those kids we once were.

56:09.410 --> 56:12.880
Even if it means
calling Jesus or Santa.

56:12.980 --> 56:14.715
Come on, guys,
we've got work to do!

56:14.815 --> 56:17.652
Sounds good.
I'll be right back.

56:19.654 --> 56:21.388
Moisha, Hackelm, kids,
get your things.

56:21.489 --> 56:22.490
We need to go now.

56:22.590 --> 56:23.958
What's going on, Dad?

56:24.058 --> 56:26.160
Your Uncle Kyle wants to
go back and change things.

56:26.260 --> 56:28.596
He's going to try
and change the past.

56:28.696 --> 56:31.198
But I like things
the way they are.

56:31.298 --> 56:34.168
Me too, Dad. Do you think
he'll be able to do it?

56:34.268 --> 56:35.736
No, kids.

56:35.836 --> 56:37.572
Fuck Uncle Kyle.

56:37.672 --> 56:38.706
BOTH:
Yay!

56:38.806 --> 56:40.808
-Yay, Daddy!
-Fuck Uncle Kyle!

56:44.679 --> 56:46.914
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

56:47.014 --> 56:50.084
People were supposed to
get kinder in the future.

56:50.918 --> 56:53.554
I'm so sorry
what happened to both of you.

56:53.654 --> 56:56.390
It wasn't your fault, Randy.

56:56.491 --> 56:58.759
It was all Stan's fault.

56:58.859 --> 57:02.396
Yes, it was all Stan's fault.

57:03.197 --> 57:05.332
Thanks for saying that,
you guys.

57:05.432 --> 57:07.868
I'm sorry Stan
sucks so hard sometimes.

57:07.968 --> 57:10.270
Don't give up, Randy.

57:10.370 --> 57:12.239
Humanity needs you.

57:12.339 --> 57:13.941
No!

57:14.041 --> 57:16.176
I can't do it alone!

57:16.276 --> 57:19.747
How can things possibly go
back to the way they were?

57:19.847 --> 57:22.082
(wind gusting)

57:32.760 --> 57:34.361
It can't be.

57:34.461 --> 57:35.830
It's impossible.

57:38.165 --> 57:42.436
It's the last little
sprout of Tegridy.

57:48.442 --> 57:50.611
I have to get you
somewhere safe.

57:50.711 --> 57:53.047
We have a lot of work to do.

57:53.814 --> 57:56.050
* *

58:00.588 --> 58:02.823
(footsteps echoing)

58:06.661 --> 58:09.196
(people wailing)

58:09.296 --> 58:12.299
(crazed laughter)

58:13.934 --> 58:18.072
We just had another call asking
to speak with Victor Chouce.

58:18.172 --> 58:21.008
You're quite a popular man,
Victor.

58:24.444 --> 58:27.114
I wonder what
all the fuss is about.

58:30.117 --> 58:33.788
Don't feel like talking, huh?
(chuckles)

58:33.888 --> 58:36.123
You will.

58:39.026 --> 58:41.328
* We are all, you and me *

58:41.428 --> 58:45.132
* We are all living
in the future *

58:45.232 --> 58:47.568
* We can't get stuff
'cause boats are late *

58:47.668 --> 58:51.872
* And nobody's working
in the future *

58:53.841 --> 58:58.145
* They don't sell tostadas
anymore at Taco Bell *

58:58.245 --> 59:00.380
* Welcome to the future *

59:01.315 --> 59:02.917
* In the future *

59:04.318 --> 59:06.854
* We are living in the future *

59:07.955 --> 59:10.090
* It's the future *

59:11.058 --> 59:13.260
* We're living in the future. *
