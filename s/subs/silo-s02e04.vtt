WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:12.094
People would fly high above the crowd,
just flipping, like, end over end,

00:12.095 --> 00:13.472
like...

00:15.224 --> 00:19.019
and into the arms of
a person waiting on the other side.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.605
Isn't that wild?

00:27.528 --> 00:30.363
Another thing
about the circus, they had animals

00:30.364 --> 00:32.990
and they had these
huge things called elephants

00:32.991 --> 00:36.202
and they had, like,
skin as hard as concrete

00:36.203 --> 00:40.040
and these long,
flexible noses that they called trunks,

00:41.166 --> 00:47.255
and teeth that grew on either side of
their faces could grow up to 12 feet long.

00:47.256 --> 00:48.799
That sounds like a nightmare.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.134
Yeah, I like elephants.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.264
They're really smart.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.391
They're very altruistic.

00:58.392 --> 01:01.978
You know, they've been known
to help other species in trouble.

01:01.979 --> 01:04.939
Well, right now I'm a species in trouble.

01:04.940 --> 01:05.898
What?

01:05.899 --> 01:08.860
I want to try and breathe
through 50 feet of tubing

01:08.861 --> 01:12.655
without having to make
something to push the air down.

01:12.656 --> 01:13.949
But I don't think I can.

01:14.950 --> 01:16.034
Can you take that?

01:17.160 --> 01:18.287
And...

01:19.663 --> 01:21.415
I think I can fix it.

01:23.792 --> 01:26.170
Hey, you're pretty good
at making things, huh?

01:27.963 --> 01:29.714
So, what was your job at your silo?

01:29.715 --> 01:32.176
- Hey, could you-- Just lo-- Thank you.
- Oh, sorry.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.137
I was an engineer.

01:37.264 --> 01:41.101
Hey, you know, they used machines
to breathe underwater in the before times.

01:42.769 --> 01:46.230
There's this great book called
<i>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,</i>

01:46.231 --> 01:51.110
and in it they use breathing equipment
and this massive underwater ship

01:51.111 --> 01:53.571
called the <i>Nautilus</i>
to explore the ocean floor.

01:53.572 --> 01:55.406
The ocean was this
vast expanse of salt wa--

01:55.407 --> 01:56.992
No, I know. I've seen it.

01:58.076 --> 02:02.039
- I've seen it in a book.
- They let you read books in 18?

02:04.499 --> 02:05.375
No.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.085
Ah, man.

02:08.086 --> 02:10.254
Wait. Where was I? Oh, yeah.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.090
In the book, the captain of the <i>Nautilus</i>

02:13.091 --> 02:14.217
- is Nemo...
- No.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.345
- ...and you're a little bit like him.
- Can you just--

02:17.513 --> 02:18.597
Sorry.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.227
Hey.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.311
- Hey.
- Yeah?

02:25.312 --> 02:27.188
You could use a harmonium.

02:27.189 --> 02:30.316
- It's a musical instrument.
- No, I need something to write on.

02:30.317 --> 02:35.321
I need like,
a piece of slate or it's-- This is not--

02:35.322 --> 02:36.989
There's a chalkboard in the same room.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.283
- Come on.
- Okay.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.119
- Let's do that.
- Should I grab-- Here.

02:43.038 --> 02:45.832
When we were kids, I used to think
these were the names of the Founders.

02:47.835 --> 02:51.338
Now, I think they're the people
from Mechanical who died in rebellions.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.051
I think the rebellion we grew up
hearing about was just the last one.

02:57.052 --> 03:00.389
And before that,
they happened every generation.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.849
And you don't want Mechanical
to start another one?

03:02.850 --> 03:04.309
If we started any of them.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.105
Look, all right?

03:09.523 --> 03:11.358
Look what they wrote next to the names.

03:13.110 --> 03:15.904
"Started with food shortage in the farms."

03:17.072 --> 03:21.535
And then-- It looks like,
"Blamed on Mechanical."

03:23.620 --> 03:24.705
You see?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.584
"Factory workers shut down."

03:33.630 --> 03:35.257
"Trash chute fire."

03:35.966 --> 03:39.011
And look at this.
Look, it's hard to see, but--

03:40.429 --> 03:44.140
"No matter where rebellion started,

03:44.141 --> 03:47.602
the finger always pointed at Mechanical."

03:47.603 --> 03:48.854
Why?

03:50.522 --> 03:51.523
Why is that?

03:53.692 --> 03:55.777
Because we can shut this fucker down.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.113
That's right.

03:59.489 --> 04:00.657
You're not ready for that.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.408
Us shutting it down?

04:02.409 --> 04:05.286
If it gets us what we really need
and we've exhausted all of our--

04:05.287 --> 04:07.372
- They killed Cooper.
- I know!

04:11.293 --> 04:13.003
And they sent Jules out to clean.

04:14.463 --> 04:18.175
But, Shirl, other than revenge,
what do we want?

04:24.056 --> 04:25.098
The truth.

04:26.850 --> 04:30.187
So let's fucking demand it.

04:33.315 --> 04:34.650
I'm the head of Mechanical.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.027
I can get a meeting with the mayor.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.528
We take a small group.

04:38.529 --> 04:41.532
You, me, Walker,
maybe McLain, the head of Supply.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.617
And we go up.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.078
No crowds, no weapons.

04:47.079 --> 04:50.164
Every step we take will be
considered an act of aggression.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.667
Which is why we send
a message to the mayor first.

04:52.668 --> 04:54.377
Laying out exactly what
we want to talk about.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.462
Not the mayor.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.171
The judge.

04:57.172 --> 04:59.215
Jules told Walker
that Meadows is an empty robe.

04:59.216 --> 05:01.175
But the Silo doesn't know that.

05:01.176 --> 05:05.138
As far as everyone's concerned,
Judge Meadows is the boss.

05:06.515 --> 05:07.516
Okay.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.560
Okay?

05:10.227 --> 05:11.520
I'll send her the message.

06:47.199 --> 06:48.950
Is it true a gang from Mechanical

06:48.951 --> 06:50.493
is going to meet with Judge Meadows?

06:50.494 --> 06:52.036
- Hardly a gang.
- Let me stop them.

06:52.037 --> 06:54.247
- I have 50 raiders on 110.
- No, Rob.

06:54.248 --> 06:56.207
We're gonna let them air their grievances.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.084
Maybe it'll bring down the temperature.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.127
The ultimate goal is to stop a rebellion.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.587
- I don't care how.
- Every level they climb

07:01.588 --> 07:03.005
is one level closer to the air lock.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.757
What happens if they rush the stairs?

07:04.758 --> 07:06.092
Two of this gang are old ladies.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.386
They're not gonna make
a run for the air lock.

07:08.387 --> 07:11.264
But put some raiders
above Judicial if you want.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.892
This isn't the only reason
the judge concerns me.

07:14.393 --> 07:16.228
She also agreed to meet with Lukas Kyle.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.856
He requested a hearing about his sentence.
If she let's him go, that's not good.

07:19.857 --> 07:21.567
I agree.
What do you want me to do about it?

07:22.192 --> 07:24.194
I was hoping you could
have a word with her.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.239
I know you've been talking to her.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.743
You've been tracking that?

07:33.203 --> 07:34.788
Just an observation.

07:36.707 --> 07:41.128
Well, the next time I speak with her,
I'll be sure to raise your concerns.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.759
You agreed to meet with some Mechanicals?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.553
They're citizens of the Silo
who want to speak to their judge.

07:50.554 --> 07:54.432
- It sends a bad message.
- No, Bernard, it sends a new message.

07:54.433 --> 07:55.975
You also agreed
to hear Lukas Kyle's petition?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.476
He has a right to request a review.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.730
And you have a right to refuse it.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.940
What are you so afraid of?

08:02.941 --> 08:04.985
- He's dangerous.
- Well, now I really want to meet him.

08:05.736 --> 08:07.236
- I'm being serious.
- No, you're not.

08:07.237 --> 08:11.992
Because if you were being serious,
you would have brought my cleaning suit.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.620
- Do you have it?
- It's being assembled!

08:15.621 --> 08:18.248
Well, then when you have my suit,
we can talk.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.637
Hey, what are all these numbers?

08:34.097 --> 08:36.808
- No idea.
- Okay, I'm gonna need some room.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.812
Erase them.
I don't think anyone will mind.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.830
Founders' Day.

08:59.998 --> 09:03.085
It was a week before
Founders' Day that it all happened.

09:05.003 --> 09:09.382
Hey, did you have
Founders' Day in your silo?

09:09.383 --> 09:10.342
No.

09:11.093 --> 09:13.387
Did you have any holidays?

09:14.179 --> 09:15.763
We had Freedom Day.

09:15.764 --> 09:17.306
What did that celebrate?

09:17.307 --> 09:18.934
Freedom, Solo.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.685
Oh, yeah.

09:20.686 --> 09:21.770
Sorry.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.666
Lapis...

09:45.460 --> 09:47.421
She used to sit next to me.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.922
She was a funny girl.

09:49.923 --> 09:53.427
She was always making noises
and cracking me up.

10:00.726 --> 10:01.852
Her mom...

10:03.979 --> 10:06.023
she would jar peach preserves.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.651
She said that her name
meant blue or something.

10:10.652 --> 10:12.778
But I think she just said that

10:12.779 --> 10:15.114
because that was her favorite color

10:15.115 --> 10:17.409
and she really liked my blue eyes.

10:19.494 --> 10:20.495
Solo?

10:21.997 --> 10:25.375
This is a Level B classroom?

10:26.210 --> 10:30.756
So she would have been 11 or 12
when the rebellion started.

10:31.882 --> 10:33.509
So, how were you sitting next to her?

10:36.512 --> 10:40.349
Well, I didn't mean
that this belonged to Lapis.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.021
What happened to your eye?

10:47.022 --> 10:48.898
Was that during the rebellion or...

10:48.899 --> 10:51.276
Yeah, that's something
I don't like to talk about.

10:53.612 --> 10:55.112
Do-- I forgot.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.614
Do you see this?

10:56.615 --> 10:58.824
Have you seen this or something like this?

10:58.825 --> 11:00.118
Can I show you?

11:01.495 --> 11:03.580
I can pack more ginger
in case you're gone longer.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.998
- You're worried.
- Of course I am.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.544
There's a mob
from Mechanical on their way up.

11:09.253 --> 11:13.257
It's only a few people
the judge agreed to see and I trust her.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.262
If you want, I can ask a deputy to stay.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.306
I don't want a deputy.

11:22.891 --> 11:23.892
I want you.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.105
If I can help keep the peace down there,

11:29.106 --> 11:31.358
then none of us will have
anything to worry about.

11:32.693 --> 11:37.364
I'll ask somebody to stop by
and I will come back as soon as I can.

11:39.449 --> 11:40.284
Okay?

12:10.981 --> 12:11.857
You get them?

12:13.400 --> 12:15.819
My dogs were pissed.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.487
But yeah...

12:18.864 --> 12:19.865
I got 'em.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.366
You want to see?

12:22.367 --> 12:24.036
I know red from green.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.162
Okay, then.

12:26.163 --> 12:28.498
You could get literally anyone to do this.

12:29.708 --> 12:30.709
Let me come with you.

12:31.919 --> 12:32.920
For Coop.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.173
We said four people.

12:36.715 --> 12:37.716
Not five.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.384
I could stay here.

12:39.885 --> 12:43.305
Sleep in my own bed.
Catch you guys on the way back down.

12:45.015 --> 12:46.183
Suit yourself.

12:48.769 --> 12:51.063
Meadows wasn't always a drunk.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.608
When I was in Judicial,
I heard stories about her mind.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.568
The best there ever was.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.531
Then I don't know. Something happened.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.240
I never heard what.

13:02.241 --> 13:03.492
I had a thought.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.327
This might be a step too far,

13:06.328 --> 13:10.541
but the Pact outlines three grounds
for impeaching a judge.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.293
Proven misbehavior, incapacity to act,

13:14.294 --> 13:16.337
- or endangering the Silo.
- ...endangering the Silo.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.464
Impeachment?

13:18.382 --> 13:22.553
- That could be very destabilizing.
- Or it could unite the upper half.

13:23.345 --> 13:26.723
I'll need support from
a majority of levels and departments.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.518
I don't know if there's time to gather
enough signatures to stop the meeting.

13:30.519 --> 13:31.520
You don't need signatures.

13:32.104 --> 13:36.233
You only need the threat of impeachment
to send a message to Bernard.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.860
He's the one to sideline her.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.905
If he does, maybe he
goes back to seeking your counsel.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.881
Solo, could you just stop?

13:59.631 --> 14:02.133
- Stop.
- No. You gotta listen.

14:02.134 --> 14:04.594
I'm trying to figure this out
and you're playing music.

14:04.595 --> 14:05.970
And it's just in my head.

14:05.971 --> 14:08.431
Yeah but how do you
think I'm playing the music?

14:08.432 --> 14:09.683
I don't care!

14:15.105 --> 14:16.106
Yes, you do.

14:20.319 --> 14:22.904
Just-- I'm trying to show you something.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.447
Will you just come over here, please?

14:24.448 --> 14:26.449
Just one time
and I won't mention it again.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.576
I promise.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.293
- Just play.
- Okay.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.180
No, not my hands. Look at my feet.

14:50.599 --> 14:51.682
- Yeah.
- See?

14:51.683 --> 14:54.602
There's a bellows inside
that pushes air through a valve.

14:54.603 --> 14:57.105
You could use this
to push air down a tube.

15:00.567 --> 15:01.568
Look.

15:16.375 --> 15:18.085
I'm gonna have to take it apart.

15:21.922 --> 15:22.755
What?

15:22.756 --> 15:25.633
Yeah, but you could put it
back together again, right?

15:25.634 --> 15:27.802
I don't know. Maybe.

15:27.803 --> 15:30.721
Why don't you
just play one last time, okay?

15:30.722 --> 15:32.807
- Just--
- Oh, man.

15:32.808 --> 15:35.435
Well, we'll see.

15:38.272 --> 15:41.566
When a team of agents showed up
at Nichols's apartment, you fled.

15:41.567 --> 15:42.859
- Is that correct?
- Yes, but--

15:42.860 --> 15:44.403
There it is again, "Yes, but..."

15:45.070 --> 15:51.410
"Yes, I held the red-level relic,
but it wasn't in my possession."

15:56.832 --> 16:00.209
If you don't deny
the facts of your case, Mr. Kyle,

16:00.210 --> 16:03.797
why are you requesting
a review of your sentence?

16:05.799 --> 16:11.054
Let me guess. The reason, put simply, is...

16:12.931 --> 16:14.016
it's not fair.

16:15.726 --> 16:16.727
Would that be accurate?

16:22.399 --> 16:23.400
What's this made of?

16:27.446 --> 16:28.447
Metal.

16:28.989 --> 16:30.824
And where do we get
the ore to make the metal?

16:31.617 --> 16:34.745
- The mines.
- The mines are critical to our survival.

16:36.330 --> 16:41.001
But the work is hard and
it's dangerous and nobody wants to do it.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.836
So you have to do it.

16:43.837 --> 16:48.467
You and others like you
who have fallen afoul of the Pact.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.803
Just because you'll be
wearing yellow coveralls

16:52.804 --> 16:56.475
doesn't mean that
you won't be of vital service to the Silo.

17:00.437 --> 17:01.730
May I ask you a question?

17:05.692 --> 17:06.692
If you must.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.946
Why did you even grant
this request for a review?

17:10.989 --> 17:12.241
Agents, get out.

17:21.124 --> 17:22.334
Why do you think?

17:25.295 --> 17:26.879
To see if I knew what
was on the hard drive.

17:26.880 --> 17:27.964
No.

17:30.342 --> 17:33.011
I wanted to know
about the lights in the night sky.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.266
What are they?

17:38.725 --> 17:41.186
- I don't know.
- Tell me what you think you know.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.315
They move.

17:47.568 --> 17:49.862
Actually, we move.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.075
We move?

17:55.701 --> 17:56.869
What do you think that means?

17:58.245 --> 18:03.041
I think we live on a ball.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.961
A massive one and it rotates,

18:06.962 --> 18:09.589
giving the impression
that the lights move.

18:09.590 --> 18:11.591
But they don't.

18:11.592 --> 18:12.885
It's the same with the sun.

18:13.552 --> 18:16.804
It doesn't move, we do.

18:16.805 --> 18:21.685
We spin, and that gives us day
and then night.

18:27.191 --> 18:30.819
The lights in the sky are called stars.

18:31.820 --> 18:34.531
And they are massive spheres of gas.

18:35.407 --> 18:40.078
And they shine
from an energy called radiation.

18:40.996 --> 18:45.125
Which makes them perpetual balls of fire.

18:47.753 --> 18:49.378
And you're right.

18:49.379 --> 18:52.757
The world rotates

18:52.758 --> 18:58.722
and revolves around the sun.

19:00.766 --> 19:06.480
And the sun is just one
of billions of these stars.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.689
How do you know this?

19:08.690 --> 19:11.943
And wait,
are there actually other worlds that rev--

19:11.944 --> 19:13.153
Agents.

19:15.447 --> 19:18.199
Lukas Kyle, due to your forthrightness

19:18.200 --> 19:21.452
and your willingness
to accept responsibility,

19:21.453 --> 19:25.791
I will amend your sentence
to five years in the mines.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.167
May the Founders have mercy on you.

19:28.168 --> 19:29.670
- Remove him.
- No, but--

19:37.135 --> 19:39.720
- Impeach Judge Meadows!
- Judge Meadows!

19:39.721 --> 19:40.805
Impeach her!

19:40.806 --> 19:42.516
Impeach Judge Meadows!

19:44.893 --> 19:47.812
Impeach Judge Meadows! Impeach her!

19:47.813 --> 19:51.900
- Impeach her!
- Impeach Judge Meadows!

20:12.462 --> 20:14.547
It shouldn't rub quite so much anymore.

20:14.548 --> 20:15.632
Thank you.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.219
You all right?

20:21.305 --> 20:22.306
Why?

20:23.515 --> 20:26.101
You didn't come out
of your hole for 25 years.

20:28.604 --> 20:29.813
Now you're out all the time.

20:31.815 --> 20:32.816
Yeah.

20:35.319 --> 20:39.990
When I went up those stairs to get that
tape for Juliette, I was scared spitless.

20:42.201 --> 20:43.452
Then I saw you...

20:45.037 --> 20:51.752
and I started thinking
about all those years I wasted.

20:54.046 --> 20:55.088
We wasted.

20:56.882 --> 20:58.884
And I couldn't remember why.

20:59.968 --> 21:03.388
At least any why that was worth a damn.

21:17.986 --> 21:22.741
If Meadows goes for it, sending
people out to look around, come back...

21:24.993 --> 21:25.994
Yeah?

21:28.038 --> 21:29.164
Would you volunteer?

21:30.249 --> 21:31.250
In a heartbeat.

21:32.125 --> 21:33.627
- You?
- Yeah.

21:36.296 --> 21:37.297
What would you want to see?

21:39.633 --> 21:40.634
The distance.

21:49.726 --> 21:50.727
And Juliette.

21:59.945 --> 22:01.071
This not knowing...

22:02.906 --> 22:04.449
it's fucking killing me.

22:09.246 --> 22:10.622
I didn't think you liked her.

22:11.123 --> 22:13.250
She annoyed the living shit out of me...

22:15.627 --> 22:17.880
but I knew that
I could trust her with my life.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.007
Looks like we got company.

22:22.551 --> 22:23.927
You gotta be kidding me.

22:26.847 --> 22:27.848
I'll handle this.

22:29.141 --> 22:30.601
Deputy, is everything all right?

22:31.894 --> 22:33.102
You heading up to Judicial?

22:33.103 --> 22:35.521
Yeah, we got a right
to walk like everyone else.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.857
We're not here to stop you.
We're here to make sure

22:37.858 --> 22:39.483
- you get there safely.
- Why?

22:39.484 --> 22:41.485
Sheriff Billings asked us to.

22:41.486 --> 22:43.070
No, but why does he think that we need--

22:43.071 --> 22:47.074
Because you may have
a lot of friends below here, but above...

22:47.075 --> 22:48.577
...people might be throwing shit.

22:49.369 --> 22:50.453
Literally.

22:50.454 --> 22:52.581
We'll peel off a couple
of levels below Judicial.

22:53.373 --> 22:56.668
They see a sheriff's escort,
they might think we've chosen sides.

22:57.336 --> 23:00.379
So you'll leave us just
when things are likely to get bad?

23:00.380 --> 23:03.425
I mean, I'm a civilian. So yeah.

23:04.760 --> 23:06.177
Let's get on with it then.

23:06.178 --> 23:09.056
The firebomb hit here.

23:10.641 --> 23:11.642
We all scattered.

23:12.309 --> 23:13.393
The fire didn't get inside.

23:14.102 --> 23:15.103
Where was the shooter?

23:16.146 --> 23:17.189
Right there.

23:17.940 --> 23:19.106
Retired raider.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.316
Reggie Smalls.

23:20.317 --> 23:22.027
Says he was just reacting as trained.

23:22.611 --> 23:24.529
The asshole with the firebomb?

23:24.530 --> 23:25.613
Over there.

23:25.614 --> 23:28.867
A local kid Cooper was running in
to try and stop the guy.

23:30.827 --> 23:33.789
- Anybody recognize him?
- No.

23:35.165 --> 23:36.457
I'd like to see him.

23:36.458 --> 23:39.336
I wish you could.
Judicial hauled him up this morning.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.128
- They give a reason?
- No.

23:41.129 --> 23:44.465
When I asked, they just gave me that look,
you know that Judicial look.

23:44.466 --> 23:45.758
I used to be in Judicial.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.635
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:47.636 --> 23:50.389
- I didn't--
- No. I know that look only too well.

23:50.889 --> 23:51.890
Right.

23:53.559 --> 23:54.977
You still have Cooper's body?

23:58.564 --> 23:59.648
Okay.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.573
You can start. I think that works.

24:08.407 --> 24:09.407
Solo?

24:09.408 --> 24:11.201
Pump. Pump hard.

24:13.996 --> 24:16.164
Okay, that's not good enough. Stop.

24:17.666 --> 24:19.334
Okay. I think if I--

24:20.085 --> 24:22.879
- Maybe--
- I gotta go back to the vault.

24:22.880 --> 24:25.089
What? Why?

24:25.090 --> 24:26.883
I think I left it unlocked.

24:26.884 --> 24:28.843
Well, there's no one here.

24:28.844 --> 24:30.469
I think we're okay.

24:30.470 --> 24:31.971
No, I think I gotta go check it.

24:31.972 --> 24:34.182
No, it's okay. I saw you. You locked it.

24:34.183 --> 24:35.850
- I don't think so.
- No, but you did.

24:35.851 --> 24:37.560
You closed the door and it locked.

24:37.561 --> 24:40.021
- You're just saying that.
- No! Wait, what are you doing?

24:40.022 --> 24:41.607
You locked the vault.

24:43.317 --> 24:44.318
Okay?

24:45.652 --> 24:47.362
Yeah, I locked it.

25:13.263 --> 25:14.556
Was it you?

25:15.140 --> 25:16.308
Absolutely not.

25:16.850 --> 25:20.938
I'm to believe that an effort
to impeach me just arose spontaneously?

25:22.064 --> 25:23.357
People are afraid,

25:24.024 --> 25:26.692
and they get more afraid with every step

25:26.693 --> 25:29.403
that a group of Mechanicals takes
toward the air lock.

25:29.404 --> 25:31.197
You should have read the letter
that they sent.

25:31.198 --> 25:33.699
All they want is to build better suits

25:33.700 --> 25:36.954
and to send a few people out
to explore and come back.

25:38.247 --> 25:40.998
Just a little exploration.

25:40.999 --> 25:42.458
Oh, that's--

25:42.459 --> 25:45.586
Everything about that
is prohibited by the Pact.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.213
I wasn't going to agree to it.

25:47.214 --> 25:51.260
I was gonna say we'd form a committee
to study these ideas.

25:53.428 --> 25:55.346
And kill it with bureaucracy.

25:55.347 --> 25:56.682
Yes.

26:02.938 --> 26:03.772
I'm--

26:04.690 --> 26:09.026
I'm sorry about the impeachment talk.

26:09.027 --> 26:10.654
Look, I don't care.

26:13.365 --> 26:15.200
I'll be long gone before it could happen.

26:17.578 --> 26:20.080
Would you come to my apartment?

26:21.206 --> 26:23.166
For dinner. Tonight.

26:24.835 --> 26:27.211
- Why?
- We need to talk about next steps.

26:27.212 --> 26:29.005
My next steps are out the air lock.

26:29.006 --> 26:30.465
I'll have your suit.

26:31.967 --> 26:33.760
You can try it on.

26:41.643 --> 26:42.853
Come at 7:00?

26:44.188 --> 26:47.064
The Mechanicals won't be up here
until 9:00.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.358
Okay.

26:53.989 --> 26:55.657
I spoke to Lukas Kyle.

26:56.283 --> 26:57.783
You're right. He is dangerous.

26:57.784 --> 27:01.120
Then why did you cut his sentence in half?

27:01.121 --> 27:03.081
To make it seem like we're fair.

27:04.291 --> 27:05.333
Besides, someone like him,

27:05.334 --> 27:08.212
do you really think he could last
more than a year in the mines?

27:15.385 --> 27:16.762
I'll see you tonight.

27:18.055 --> 27:21.058
If the mob don't grab me
and throw me over the rail.

27:32.236 --> 27:34.279
- Can you try again?
- Yeah.

27:36.448 --> 27:38.992
Yeah. Okay, I think that'll work.

27:41.078 --> 27:42.246
Okay.

27:57.761 --> 27:59.095
Are you okay?

27:59.096 --> 28:00.931
Yeah.

28:01.849 --> 28:05.142
Yeah. I'll be fine.
I'll just have to get across the alleyway

28:05.143 --> 28:07.478
into the room and I'll be fine.

28:07.479 --> 28:08.938
I've done worse.

28:08.939 --> 28:12.483
Okay, so when I'm underwater,
just make sure you--

28:12.484 --> 28:14.402
Don't stop pumping, I know.

28:14.403 --> 28:15.946
Yeah. Okay.

28:17.865 --> 28:19.073
<i>There's no body, Hank.</i>

28:19.074 --> 28:20.741
Judicial took it.

28:20.742 --> 28:23.494
No, we don't want to see the asshole
with the firebomb.

28:23.495 --> 28:24.579
We wanna see Coop.

28:24.580 --> 28:26.247
No, that's what I'm telling you.

28:26.248 --> 28:27.666
They took Coop.

28:28.166 --> 28:29.167
What?

28:29.168 --> 28:30.293
Why?

28:30.294 --> 28:33.630
They said they were here for a body
and the only one here was Coop.

28:34.173 --> 28:36.132
- So they took him.
- No.

28:36.133 --> 28:37.842
I tried to explain,
but they were Judicial.

28:37.843 --> 28:39.468
There were two bodies here yesterday.

28:39.469 --> 28:40.595
Not this morning.

28:40.596 --> 28:43.222
So, what happened?

28:43.223 --> 28:44.515
I don't know.

28:44.516 --> 28:45.850
You don't know?

28:45.851 --> 28:48.311
- Well, did you lock the door last night?
- Yes, I locked the door.

28:48.312 --> 28:50.188
- You think I'm an idiot?
- I don't know, Juno.

28:50.189 --> 28:52.858
- You had two bodies here yesterday--
- The one that's missing, describe it.

28:55.652 --> 28:58.447
It was a guy, about 40.

28:59.114 --> 29:00.115
Medium build.

29:01.033 --> 29:02.951
Big beard. Long hair.

29:19.968 --> 29:20.801
Yeah.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.804
You'll be okay, Captain Nemo.

32:14.184 --> 32:16.353
Hi.

32:17.396 --> 32:18.396
Satie?

32:18.397 --> 32:19.898
I remember you liked him.

32:32.327 --> 32:36.915
Fuck.

32:47.593 --> 32:48.594
Fuck.

33:33.555 --> 33:34.889
Okay.

33:34.890 --> 33:36.517
Okay, yeah.

33:52.991 --> 33:54.243
Hey!

33:55.911 --> 33:57.538
The vault.

34:03.669 --> 34:06.004
Come on.

34:06.672 --> 34:07.588
Hey.

34:07.589 --> 34:09.131
I gotta go back to the vault.

34:09.132 --> 34:11.216
- It's okay. Okay, wait.
- No.

34:11.217 --> 34:12.176
- Wait. Hey!
- Now!

34:12.177 --> 34:14.262
- I gotta go back to the vault.
- Wait.

34:14.263 --> 34:16.680
No! Look, I'm in charge. I'm responsible.

34:16.681 --> 34:18.433
Okay. Fuck me.

34:27.025 --> 34:29.526
- It's locked.
- Oh, yeah?

34:29.527 --> 34:31.237
- Yeah.
- You feel better?

34:32.197 --> 34:34.240
- Yeah.
- Okay.

34:34.241 --> 34:35.449
I'm gonna go back inside.

34:44.585 --> 34:45.878
What?

34:47.004 --> 34:48.380
You okay?

34:48.880 --> 34:49.797
Yeah.

34:56.054 --> 34:57.222
What happened?

35:00.142 --> 35:02.351
Well, maybe you got the number wrong.

35:02.352 --> 35:03.561
- What did you do?
- Huh?

35:03.562 --> 35:05.521
- I didn't do anything.
- No, you messed with it.

35:05.522 --> 35:08.107
- You want to keep me out.
- I've been with you the whole time!

35:08.108 --> 35:10.694
I have one more try
and then I'm locked out.

35:12.112 --> 35:14.030
Calm-- Hey!

35:14.031 --> 35:15.239
Just--

35:15.240 --> 35:17.158
No, I shouldn't have left.

35:17.159 --> 35:18.785
It's safe in there.

35:20.329 --> 35:22.038
- Maybe you should write it down.
- Shut up!

35:22.039 --> 35:23.665
Okay.

35:32.799 --> 35:35.009
See? I didn't do anything.

35:35.010 --> 35:36.470
- Stay back.
- Solo.

35:47.523 --> 35:49.607
I actually trained for that race.

35:49.608 --> 35:51.025
Thirty minutes a day.

35:51.026 --> 35:53.654
If you'd trained two hours a day,
you still would have lost.

35:55.155 --> 35:56.532
You're an asshole.

35:59.952 --> 36:03.789
Well, as not unpleasant as this has been...

36:05.874 --> 36:07.417
I would like to try on my suit.

36:10.128 --> 36:11.672
You said it would be here by now.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.822
I know it wasn't in the wine.

36:37.573 --> 36:39.491
I wasn't sure you would drink it.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.453
It was the mushrooms.

36:47.666 --> 36:51.503
- How long do I have?
- Minutes rather than hours.

36:55.591 --> 36:56.841
Why?

36:56.842 --> 37:00.303
I must follow <i>The Order</i>.

37:00.304 --> 37:04.016
You have a way that my death
will serve that?

37:04.600 --> 37:06.185
It will unite the Silo.

37:10.147 --> 37:11.606
Mary, I'm sorry.

37:11.607 --> 37:15.026
That hard drive that Juliette Nichols had,
where is it?

37:15.027 --> 37:16.528
I destroyed it.

37:17.446 --> 37:18.529
Why?

37:18.530 --> 37:19.823
What was on it?

37:20.407 --> 37:22.241
If I need to know something,
then you have to--

37:22.242 --> 37:24.744
Even if you did know,
there's nothing that you can do about it.

37:24.745 --> 37:25.954
All I can say is that...

37:26.955 --> 37:28.998
it had something to do
with Salvador Quinn.

37:28.999 --> 37:31.042
140 years ago, when he was head of IT--

37:31.043 --> 37:32.460
- During the rebellion?
- Yes.

37:32.461 --> 37:34.921
He wrote a letter. Part of it was in code.

37:34.922 --> 37:37.048
- What did it say?
- I can't tell you, Bernard.

37:37.049 --> 37:39.051
- But you deciphered it, didn't you?
- Stop.

37:40.219 --> 37:42.429
- I said I can't.
- You have to.

37:46.725 --> 37:48.352
Twenty-five years ago,

37:49.561 --> 37:53.314
when I told you why I had to step down
as your shadow, I said--

37:53.315 --> 37:55.816
You said you didn't want to be tethered
to me for the rest of your life.

37:55.817 --> 37:57.444
Which was a lie.

38:00.155 --> 38:02.699
I would happily have been by your side,

38:03.408 --> 38:05.661
but I knew that you could never
give yourself fully to me.

38:07.246 --> 38:08.455
Why did you lie?

38:09.373 --> 38:11.123
I didn't dare tell you the truth.

38:11.124 --> 38:13.168
You vanished for four days.

38:14.628 --> 38:16.088
When you came back, you quit.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.340
Where did you go?

38:19.633 --> 38:22.301
Please, can I just go to the cafeteria
just one more time?

38:22.302 --> 38:24.512
Just to see the outside again.

38:24.513 --> 38:25.722
One more time.

38:27.683 --> 38:29.101
No.

38:34.648 --> 38:37.025
But I have something.

38:43.031 --> 38:45.241
Did you ever use this
when you sat with the Legacy?

38:45.242 --> 38:46.659
No.

38:46.660 --> 38:48.077
It lets you see things.

38:48.078 --> 38:51.956
Somewhat like what people that are
sent out to clean see in their helmets.

38:51.957 --> 38:53.458
Only this is real.

38:54.042 --> 38:57.629
Did you ever read about Costa Rica?

38:59.965 --> 39:01.758
This was from Costa Rica.

39:02.676 --> 39:07.305
The Monteverde Cloud Forest
Biological Reserve, 2018.

39:07.306 --> 39:09.557
Tilt your head up a little bit
to the left.

39:09.558 --> 39:13.562
See that little fella lounging
on the vine?

39:14.354 --> 39:17.941
That is a white-faced capuchin monkey.

39:18.734 --> 39:19.735
Now watch.

39:20.360 --> 39:22.613
It's gonna leap from the vine
to the tree on your right.

39:29.786 --> 39:33.623
Now, look down and to your right.

39:33.624 --> 39:34.708
Yeah.

39:36.502 --> 39:40.129
That is a red-eyed tree frog.

39:40.130 --> 39:42.382
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

39:45.969 --> 39:49.932
Bright colors are a defense mechanism.

39:51.183 --> 39:52.726
The green is camouflage.

39:53.894 --> 39:58.190
It allows it to blend
into its surroundings to avoid predators.

40:02.444 --> 40:04.529
Quick, look up.

40:04.530 --> 40:06.907
Now, at the top of the trees. Look.

40:08.450 --> 40:10.953
That's a flock of Quetzal birds.

40:12.412 --> 40:19.085
You can tell they're males
by their twin tail feathers.

40:19.086 --> 40:20.211
So beautiful.

40:20.212 --> 40:21.839
It's wonderful.

40:23.507 --> 40:24.716
So beautiful.

40:30.597 --> 40:32.391
What did they do, Bernard?

40:34.768 --> 40:36.812
How did they lose this world?

40:48.532 --> 40:50.576
I thought we were past this, Solo.

41:03.839 --> 41:06.175
You know when I was sent out to clean, I--

41:09.178 --> 41:12.555
I was so tired.

41:12.556 --> 41:13.807
Like--

41:14.975 --> 41:17.477
There was a part of me that was--

41:19.646 --> 41:21.648
It sounds really weird but, like--

41:23.066 --> 41:27.863
I was relieved
that it was finally fucking over.

41:29.281 --> 41:30.282
You know?

41:31.825 --> 41:33.535
And then when I got outside,

41:35.037 --> 41:36.163
I was really--

41:39.082 --> 41:41.709
I was really f... lonely.

41:41.710 --> 41:42.836
And--

41:44.254 --> 41:47.966
I was so scared.

41:50.761 --> 41:52.304
I was really fucking scared.

41:56.266 --> 41:58.477
Every step, I--

42:00.854 --> 42:03.898
I thought, like,

42:03.899 --> 42:05.192
"This is it.

42:06.693 --> 42:07.861
Like, this is--

42:09.655 --> 42:14.284
This is where I collapse.
Or this is my spot.

42:16.078 --> 42:17.829
Like, this is where I die." And I--

42:21.458 --> 42:25.337
But I didn't. You know, I kept walking.

42:27.756 --> 42:29.341
I didn't know what else to do.

42:33.303 --> 42:36.472
So I know what it's like
to be scared, Solo.

42:36.473 --> 42:37.558
You're not--

42:39.977 --> 42:41.019
You're not the only one.

42:51.280 --> 42:52.489
Solo?

42:57.077 --> 43:00.747
Captain Nemo would like to know more
about that place.

43:04.126 --> 43:07.671
What do you call it? The circus.

43:08.172 --> 43:09.589
Do you wanna tell me about that?

43:09.590 --> 43:14.261
You could also--
You could tell me about the--

43:18.307 --> 43:20.017
The things with the long noses.

43:23.478 --> 43:25.230
I don't remember what they were called.

44:08.899 --> 44:09.942
Hey.

44:10.817 --> 44:13.070
They're called elephants.

44:14.154 --> 44:15.405
Yeah.

44:16.406 --> 44:21.369
And then, they also had cats,
but they weren't like our cats.

44:21.370 --> 44:23.455
These were huge,

44:24.206 --> 44:28.042
and they could grow up
to, like, 400 pounds.

44:28.043 --> 44:29.628
They were called lions.

44:30.420 --> 44:33.507
They would train them to jump
through hoops of fire.

44:36.051 --> 44:37.719
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:07.416 --> 45:09.418
Do exactly as I instructed.

45:10.544 --> 45:11.753
I'll meet you there.

45:50.167 --> 45:53.628
Molly, when everyone
was trying to get Nichols,

45:53.629 --> 45:55.338
you took two men into custody.

45:55.339 --> 45:58.841
<i>Yeah, Danny something.</i>

45:58.842 --> 46:02.470
<i>Bly. And Kennedy. Patrick Kennedy.</i>

46:02.471 --> 46:04.096
What happened to them?

46:04.097 --> 46:05.765
<i>Judicial took 'em. Hard.</i>

46:05.766 --> 46:07.850
<i>Gagged 'em and bagged 'em.</i>

46:07.851 --> 46:10.395
Kennedy had a big beard and long hair?

46:11.522 --> 46:13.731
<i>Yeah. Why?</i>

46:13.732 --> 46:15.691
We're working on something.

46:15.692 --> 46:16.735
Take care.

46:18.278 --> 46:21.656
The bearded guy,
did a doctor say he was dead?

46:21.657 --> 46:23.950
No. Not officially.

46:23.951 --> 46:26.202
But he wasn't moving
when they took him away.

46:26.203 --> 46:29.122
- Where was he shot?
- Right here.

46:31.041 --> 46:32.750
No. Wait.

46:32.751 --> 46:33.836
Here.

46:51.645 --> 46:53.689
Judge Meadows is expecting us!

46:55.482 --> 46:57.441
We're here on official Judicial business!

46:57.442 --> 46:59.443
- Let us through.
- Just trying to do my job. Get back!

46:59.444 --> 47:02.154
These animals wanna kill the Silo.

47:02.155 --> 47:03.365
You with us or with them?

47:07.619 --> 47:10.121
Sorry, Judicial is closed today.

47:10.122 --> 47:11.956
We're not leaving until we see the judge.

47:11.957 --> 47:13.333
You are leaving.

47:14.126 --> 47:17.629
Either back down the stairs
or over the side.

47:31.935 --> 47:32.978
Red ball!

47:44.281 --> 47:47.283
Five, four,

47:47.284 --> 47:51.038
three, two, one.

48:10.849 --> 48:14.561
The power stays out
until we see the judge.

48:29.284 --> 48:30.327
Move.

48:32.788 --> 48:33.788
Mr. Mayor.

48:33.789 --> 48:35.290
Mr. Knox.

48:36.583 --> 48:39.002
I see you've turned off the power.

48:39.586 --> 48:42.130
Bring out Judge Meadows,
we'll turn it back on.

48:47.094 --> 48:49.220
She's not feeling well,

48:49.221 --> 48:53.892
but I believe I can get you in
to see her if you turn the lights back on.

49:39.271 --> 49:40.522
Just you two.

50:31.406 --> 50:32.783
What the fuck?

50:33.575 --> 50:35.202
They set us up.

50:37.454 --> 50:41.415
No.

50:41.416 --> 50:45.587
Listen to me. Knox, we need to go. Now.

50:48.966 --> 50:50.509
I'm not stopping you.

50:55.013 --> 50:56.431
You sure about this?

50:56.932 --> 50:58.725
I have raiders right outside.

50:59.393 --> 51:02.521
The people of the Silo
have to take care of this themselves.

51:05.899 --> 51:08.025
- We can't run.
- We have to run.

51:08.026 --> 51:11.279
There are 50 raiders
and a hundred angry assholes out there.

51:11.280 --> 51:13.489
We walk until we get to Walker and McLain.

51:13.490 --> 51:15.742
- Then we run!
- Then we fucking run!

51:28.088 --> 51:29.173
We have to leave.

51:30.132 --> 51:31.924
Quick, but don't look scared.

51:31.925 --> 51:34.219
I wasn't, until you said that.

51:37.848 --> 51:38.891
Okay.

51:42.311 --> 51:47.232
The push to impeach Judge Meadows
was unexpected.

51:48.108 --> 51:49.484
It forced my hand.

51:51.987 --> 51:53.447
Made this necessary.

51:59.828 --> 52:02.873
I believe good will come of it.

52:05.083 --> 52:06.293
Still...

52:08.629 --> 52:10.255
I know you were behind it, Rob.

52:13.342 --> 52:15.344
Don't let 'em get too much
of a head start.

52:16.595 --> 52:18.013
You wouldn't want to lose them.

52:29.650 --> 52:30.692
Silence!

52:34.238 --> 52:35.656
I know some of you--

52:38.158 --> 52:39.326
many of you...

52:41.411 --> 52:45.499
didn't like Judge Meadows
meeting with some Down-Deepers.

52:48.418 --> 52:52.673
She only met with them
because, in her words,

52:53.799 --> 52:58.887
every citizen of the Silo
deserves a hearing.

53:02.349 --> 53:07.688
Well, it seems she miscalculated horribly.

53:10.065 --> 53:13.068
Those animals from Mechanical
just killed her.

53:15.612 --> 53:17.364
They wanted to open the air lock.

53:19.032 --> 53:21.118
And Judge Meadows refused.

53:22.244 --> 53:25.163
She gave her life for the Silo!

53:26.248 --> 53:27.249
For you!

53:28.125 --> 53:29.126
For me!

53:30.127 --> 53:34.715
It is now the duty of every citizen

53:35.215 --> 53:40.094
to find those murderers
and bring them to justice!

53:40.095 --> 53:43.223
Justice!

53:43.974 --> 53:47.186
Justice!

53:48.854 --> 53:51.398
Justice!
