01:38.208 --> 01:38.958
Rocio!

01:39.625 --> 01:41.708
Hello. I’m Giselle.

01:41.875 --> 01:43.958
I heard you singing in the market.

01:44.458 --> 01:45.292
Remember?

01:45.583 --> 01:46.333
Yes.

01:47.292 --> 01:48.667
Wow...

01:49.708 --> 01:51.833
You’re even prettier than I remember.

01:54.125 --> 01:55.375
Is your daddy home?

01:56.500 --> 01:57.667
OK. OK.

02:01.458 --> 02:02.542
Mister Aguilar?

02:03.083 --> 02:03.625
Yes.

02:03.708 --> 02:04.458
Giselle.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.542
Founder of “Discover Your Dreams”.

02:07.250 --> 02:08.167
Nice to meet you.

02:08.500 --> 02:10.750
I’d love to steal
five minutes of your time.

02:14.417 --> 02:21.333
I believe Rocio may have the talent
to be in the entertainment business.

02:23.042 --> 02:23.792
But of course,

02:24.167 --> 02:28.167
you’d need to bring her
to our annual audition tomorrow.

02:29.250 --> 02:30.917
If I were you, I’d convince him.

02:36.042 --> 02:37.708
And who is this cutie?

02:38.708 --> 02:39.500
Is he your little brother?

02:39.583 --> 02:40.583
Yes.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.167
What’s your name?

03:18.208 --> 03:18.875
No.

03:19.458 --> 03:21.417
No stage-fathers allowed.

03:22.458 --> 03:25.333
But pick-up is at 7 p.m. Sharp.

03:26.875 --> 03:28.042
- Okay.
- Bye, daddy.

03:28.125 --> 03:29.167
Bye, sweetie.

03:30.958 --> 03:31.792
Give me a hug.

03:35.542 --> 03:36.708
See you later, okay?

03:42.167 --> 03:44.042
Take good care of them.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.625
Don’t worry.

04:30.875 --> 04:33.708
Yeah. Let’s see a cute smile.

04:42.083 --> 04:46.208
Let’s fix something.
Your hair like this.

04:47.125 --> 04:50.917
Yeah, you look like a star.

25:01.667 --> 25:02.542
Hello.

25:05.583 --> 25:06.792
What’s your name?

25:12.458 --> 25:13.875
Teddy Bear.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.042
No, not that name.

25:27.208 --> 25:28.958
Your real name.

25:35.208 --> 25:36.167
Miguel.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.667
Miguel Aguilar.

25:45.292 --> 25:47.042
Nice to meet you, Miguel.

25:50.708 --> 25:51.625
Come with me.

26:26.958 --> 26:28.208
That’s a Mustang.

26:28.958 --> 26:31.167
That’s a very fast car.

26:36.125 --> 26:37.333
I’m hungry.

26:39.750 --> 26:41.625
Wanna get a burger?

26:44.250 --> 26:45.208
Let me guess.

26:46.542 --> 26:50.417
You’re seven and a half.

26:53.000 --> 26:54.083
Is it April?

26:54.458 --> 26:57.750
No. It’s July. July 12. Why?

27:00.792 --> 27:02.583
Then I’m eight.

27:12.417 --> 27:14.875
I’ve got a son just your age.

27:16.042 --> 27:17.292
His name’s Kalen.

27:18.750 --> 27:19.917
And I’m Tim.

27:21.000 --> 27:21.958
Tim Ballard.

27:23.083 --> 27:26.750
But you can call me Timoteo.

27:29.167 --> 27:30.375
Timoteo?

27:32.125 --> 27:34.292
That’s my name in Spanish, right?

27:48.458 --> 27:50.083
It has your name on it.

27:50.917 --> 27:52.542
My sister gave it to me.

27:59.333 --> 28:01.458
You rescue children, right?

28:02.833 --> 28:06.958
Maybe you can help me find her.

28:13.708 --> 28:15.292
Where is your sister?

28:20.875 --> 28:23.875
The beach is the perfect spot
for a photo shoot.

28:24.667 --> 28:25.958
You like the beach, right?

28:26.500 --> 28:27.792
Yes!

28:28.583 --> 28:30.792
Simba? What’s wrong?

28:32.292 --> 28:33.792
My name is not Simba.

28:34.333 --> 28:36.417
Well… From now on, it is.

28:37.042 --> 28:39.667
Ma’am? But my papa doesn’t know.

28:42.583 --> 28:44.083
Your papa knows.

29:19.833 --> 29:21.625
On your feet. Come down, come down.

29:22.208 --> 29:23.125
Let’s go.

29:25.083 --> 29:25.875
Go.

29:26.917 --> 29:30.292
Go, go. Go inside!

29:30.500 --> 29:34.333
No! Where are you taking us?
Please, take us home!

29:34.458 --> 29:37.042
Shut up or you’ll get a beating.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.958
No, please! Help us, please.

29:52.167 --> 29:55.542
Help! Please!

29:55.958 --> 29:58.833
Help! Please!

29:59.625 --> 30:01.042
Get us out of here!

30:56.625 --> 30:58.375
And where did they take you?

31:11.583 --> 31:12.708
What do you see?

31:13.375 --> 31:14.500
Four men.

31:15.167 --> 31:16.708
Are they nice men?

31:25.250 --> 31:28.333
Why are you giving me this?
Dad gave it to you.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.417
It’s yours now. Don’t lose it.

31:40.750 --> 31:43.500
Stand up! Get in a line! Now!

31:43.583 --> 31:50.042
Stand up! Come here!
In line, standing up.

32:16.583 --> 32:17.417
- Come.
- No.

32:17.750 --> 32:20.500
- Don’t take him! No!
- Come, come, come!

33:16.875 --> 33:17.792
Want another one?

33:22.542 --> 33:24.333
Here’s the deal:

33:29.500 --> 33:34.167
I can help you,
but you need to help me too.

33:35.833 --> 33:37.125
If you don’t help me,

33:38.000 --> 33:39.750
the bad men...

33:40.625 --> 33:44.500
will find out and they
will kill your sister.

33:45.583 --> 33:47.833
No, no, don’t worry.

33:48.833 --> 33:52.542
Just do what I say,

33:53.333 --> 33:56.208
and your sister will be fine.

33:58.125 --> 34:03.208
Promise me you’ll do
whatever I tell you.

34:05.375 --> 34:06.167
Okay?

34:08.333 --> 34:09.792
Come on, eat, eat up.

34:10.750 --> 34:11.792
Eat, eat.

34:16.000 --> 34:19.250
Ever flown in an airplane?

34:19.667 --> 34:20.500
No?

34:23.458 --> 34:25.875
Captain Miguel, with the stars.

35:10.875 --> 35:12.708
Teddy Bear.

35:14.708 --> 35:15.833
Do you like it?

35:17.333 --> 35:19.042
“Teddy Bear.”

35:21.292 --> 35:25.958
Teddy Bear. I like it.
We’re gonna call you Teddy Bear.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.833
How long you were with her?

35:32.708 --> 35:34.500
A week? A month?

35:37.583 --> 35:38.958
A long time...

35:44.208 --> 35:45.583
Mister Timoteo?

35:46.833 --> 35:47.625
Yes?

35:48.417 --> 35:50.667
Will they hurt my sister now?

35:58.292 --> 35:59.542
I promise...

36:00.375 --> 36:04.000
they will never find out
what you told me.

36:05.625 --> 36:06.833
I promise.

36:59.625 --> 37:01.667
We don’t know for certain,

37:02.458 --> 37:06.542
but we think he spent about...

37:06.917 --> 37:08.792
three months in Tijuana.

37:19.667 --> 37:20.833
You’re a father.

37:21.792 --> 37:22.667
Yes.

37:25.875 --> 37:26.917
May I?

37:41.917 --> 37:45.500
Could you sleep at night knowing that
one of your children’s beds...

37:46.500 --> 37:47.875
is empty?

38:40.583 --> 38:42.250
Please keep this.

38:46.083 --> 38:47.500
No, it’s yours.

38:48.042 --> 38:49.083
Please.

44:12.250 --> 44:13.208
Nice to meet you.

45:19.542 --> 45:21.958
Hey, Mami!
Keep an eye on my Ferrari.

45:22.042 --> 45:22.875
Okay.

49:49.625 --> 49:50.500
Who’s this?

50:06.250 --> 50:07.708
I don’t understand, amigo.

51:11.125 --> 51:11.958
Hi, love.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.208
Hello, pretty.

51:14.958 --> 51:15.833
Calacas!

51:17.750 --> 51:19.375
Vampiro!

51:36.042 --> 51:37.792
This is sweet.

01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:16.958
My love…

01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:19.958
Pablo Delgado. Nice to meet you.

01:06:24.625 --> 01:06:25.542
Loosen up!

01:06:34.708 --> 01:06:36.917
Loosen up! Loosen up!

01:06:45.667 --> 01:06:46.667
My love…

01:06:47.542 --> 01:06:49.375
Pablo Delgado. A pleasure.

01:07:10.667 --> 01:07:13.792
Welcome. Beware of your heads.

01:07:20.875 --> 01:07:22.000
My soul brother,

01:07:29.417 --> 01:07:30.292
A pleasure.

01:07:39.875 --> 01:07:40.958
Extravagant.

01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:43.417
The pretty boy is horny!

01:09:25.707 --> 01:09:27.082
Cheers, hermanos.

01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:28.832
Cheers.

01:10:09.042 --> 01:10:09.833
For you, papi.

01:10:09.875 --> 01:10:10.708
Gracias.

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:50.708
Let’s go.

01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:53.500
Quick, so you don’t get wet.

01:11:06.792 --> 01:11:08.500
Remember, it’s a party.

01:11:16.583 --> 01:11:18.583
This is beautiful.

01:11:24.292 --> 01:11:25.458
I died...

01:11:26.542 --> 01:11:28.375
and went to heaven.

01:11:30.167 --> 01:11:31.875
This is a paradise.

01:11:33.125 --> 01:11:35.167
Osorio Rodriguez.

01:11:46.375 --> 01:11:48.208
He’s our Don King, papi.

01:12:01.125 --> 01:12:03.708
Get happy. Cheer up, cheer up.

01:13:03.792 --> 01:13:07.292
Excuse me. Want more?

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.750
Respect me, asshole!

01:14:29.083 --> 01:14:30.250
Brother…

01:15:38.417 --> 01:15:40.708
Now! Green light…

01:16:17.125 --> 01:16:17.958
Come.

01:16:18.292 --> 01:16:23.125
Hurray! Finally arrived!

01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:28.958
Come, come.

01:16:33.792 --> 01:16:36.292
Let’s go to the party.

01:16:54.375 --> 01:16:55.917
Stop! Hands up!

01:16:59.375 --> 01:17:00.417
Nobody moves!

01:17:00.875 --> 01:17:03.208
I’m victim! I’m victim!

01:17:05.792 --> 01:17:07.542
Stop! Police!

01:17:07.667 --> 01:17:10.000
- On the ground! On the ground!
- Calm, calm!

01:17:44.125 --> 01:17:44.958
Shut up!

01:17:46.542 --> 01:17:48.875
Leave him with me.

01:18:48.125 --> 01:18:49.833
Uncuff them.

01:21:43.917 --> 01:21:44.875
Come here.

01:21:46.917 --> 01:21:47.958
Come here, son.

01:22:23.792 --> 01:22:27.458
Do you know what happens
to pedophiles in cell 142?

01:22:27.875 --> 01:22:29.542
Just ask your friend Carne.

01:22:30.042 --> 01:22:35.167
Okay, okay!
Okay, you asshole, okay!

01:22:44.792 --> 01:22:45.875
Okay?

01:22:48.375 --> 01:22:49.333
Okay, what?

01:22:50.292 --> 01:22:51.875
Asshole, what?

01:22:52.042 --> 01:22:53.417
The Scorpion.

01:23:22.458 --> 01:23:24.333
Little princess...

01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:30.833
It’s time you make me
some real money.

01:26:35.208 --> 01:26:36.333
These gringos.

01:29:00.792 --> 01:29:01.833
Gracias.

01:31:46.708 --> 01:31:48.167
We’re doctors.

01:31:53.583 --> 01:31:54.375
Don’t shoot.

01:32:03.917 --> 01:32:05.667
We’re doctors. Don’t shoot.

01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:08.167
Get down! Get down!

01:32:08.458 --> 01:32:09.750
We’re doctors
from the United Nations.

01:32:09.833 --> 01:32:11.667
Down, down!

01:32:12.208 --> 01:32:14.458
Lay down! Don’t look at me.

01:32:14.708 --> 01:32:16.333
Doctors from the United Nations.

01:32:16.458 --> 01:32:17.875
Shut up!

01:32:18.542 --> 01:32:20.500
Easy, easy!

01:32:30.417 --> 01:32:31.625
What do they have?

01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:34.958
Vaccines. They’re clean.

01:32:40.958 --> 01:32:42.542
Alacran? Alacran, copy?

01:32:44.875 --> 01:32:46.417
It seems they’re just vaccines.

01:32:49.208 --> 01:32:50.375
Okay, boss.

01:32:51.792 --> 01:32:53.833
Why the hell are you looking at me?

01:32:54.667 --> 01:32:56.833
Just one of you will come with us.

01:32:57.375 --> 01:32:58.375
Who?

01:33:00.125 --> 01:33:01.125
Who?

01:33:03.333 --> 01:33:05.208
- Who’s coming?
- Easy, easy.

01:33:05.333 --> 01:33:06.750
Me, here.

01:33:20.625 --> 01:33:21.542
The vaccines.

01:33:21.625 --> 01:33:22.625
Pass them to me.

01:33:26.417 --> 01:33:28.042
Come on. Help him!

01:33:28.125 --> 01:33:29.792
Yes. Easy.

01:33:36.542 --> 01:33:38.708
What are you talking about?

01:33:38.958 --> 01:33:40.292
Do you want your ass full of lead?

01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:41.417
No.

01:33:41.458 --> 01:33:42.708
Let’s go.

01:33:48.708 --> 01:33:49.542
Let’s go.

01:36:48.833 --> 01:36:49.958
Boss!

01:36:51.208 --> 01:36:52.125
Boss!

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:04.333
Keep moving.

01:40:09.875 --> 01:40:12.250
I came here…
I came here to help you.

01:40:22.417 --> 01:40:24.750
You need… You need…

01:40:24.833 --> 01:40:28.167
I need you to tell me where you sleep.

01:40:28.417 --> 01:40:29.417
In which house?

01:40:29.500 --> 01:40:30.583
Oh look.

01:40:31.875 --> 01:40:33.125
There you are.

01:40:50.708 --> 01:40:53.167
Come on, come
on! Get back to work.

01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:54.792
Come on.

01:41:00.417 --> 01:41:02.875
Take the gringo to check my boys.

01:41:12.708 --> 01:41:14.833
Ei, amigo.

01:44:10.083 --> 01:44:11.042
Rocio.

01:44:13.542 --> 01:44:14.500
Rocio.

01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:19.792
No! No! No!

01:44:30.375 --> 01:44:31.250
Take it.

01:44:32.542 --> 01:44:33.625
Take some of this.

01:44:34.625 --> 01:44:36.750
This guy doesn’t know how to play.
Come on. Just take a drink.

01:44:48.125 --> 01:44:50.375
I’m gonna check on my little girl.

01:45:01.042 --> 01:45:04.583
You need to do exactly what I tell you.

01:45:06.458 --> 01:45:08.500
Or they’ll kill us both.

01:45:08.958 --> 01:45:10.333
Do you understand?

01:45:42.292 --> 01:45:43.958
Why did you scream, my child?

01:45:47.750 --> 01:45:49.083
A bad dream.

01:45:52.583 --> 01:45:53.708
Poor thing.

01:45:56.333 --> 01:45:57.542
Don’t worry.

01:45:58.750 --> 01:46:04.083
I can make your bad dream...

01:46:04.417 --> 01:46:06.333
go away.

01:46:16.417 --> 01:46:17.833
Calm down.

01:46:19.167 --> 01:46:20.292
Calm down.

01:46:55.875 --> 01:46:57.333
Why are you afraid?

01:47:01.583 --> 01:47:03.417
You know I won’t hurt you.

01:47:13.208 --> 01:47:14.458
That’s it.

01:47:15.042 --> 01:47:16.417
Close your eyes.

01:48:33.500 --> 01:48:34.542
Your home.

01:48:49.792 --> 01:48:50.708
Let's go.

01:49:06.167 --> 01:49:07.167
Boss.

01:49:08.958 --> 01:49:09.958
Boss.

01:49:14.917 --> 01:49:15.917
Alacran.

01:49:18.583 --> 01:49:19.417
Alacran!

01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:22.708
Checho!

01:50:10.500 --> 01:50:11.750
Piranha!

01:50:12.125 --> 01:50:13.167
Piranha, Piranha!

01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:14.417
Yes, sir?

01:50:14.500 --> 01:50:15.792
Check the river.

01:50:16.917 --> 01:50:20.542
Yeah, yeah. They took the boat!

01:51:24.458 --> 01:51:26.375
It’s okay, it’s okay.

01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:22.792
Rocio.

01:54:24.583 --> 01:54:25.750
Rocio.

01:54:33.333 --> 01:54:36.000
It’s me. Your papa.

01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:39.500
And your brother, Miguel.
