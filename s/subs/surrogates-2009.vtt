00:31.400 --> 00:34.000
Look at yourselves.

00:35.400 --> 00:38.900
Unplug from your chairs,
get up and look in the mirror.

00:40.100 --> 00:43.100
What you see is how God made you.

00:44.400 --> 00:48.000
We're not meant to experience the
world through a machine.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.400
Surrogates

00:56.700 --> 01:00.000
14 years ago

01:01.400 --> 01:04.500
What you're telling me is -
a monkey is operating this arm

01:04.700 --> 01:06.400
with nothing but his thoughts?

01:06.600 --> 01:07.900
Absolutely.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.400
There are 100 sensors,

01:13.600 --> 01:16.400
each listening to a different brain cell
or neuron.

01:19.700 --> 01:22.700
Physicaly disabed people
will be able to operate

01:22.900 --> 01:25.300
fully synthetic bodies.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.100
It provides a tremendous
amount of hope for the future.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.400
11 years ago

01:32.900 --> 01:35.300
Because of the technology that
we have, at a time of war

01:35.500 --> 01:37.400
we're going to start seeing this more and more.

01:37.600 --> 01:41.400
As manufacturing capacity
expanded for military/industrial use

01:41.900 --> 01:44.300
Surrogates became affordable
to the general public

01:44.600 --> 01:46.800
Causing a revolution in how
in how we live.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.200
The ability to leave your home
without risk of disease or injury

01:51.800 --> 01:55.000
To have perfect looks without trips to the gym
or plastic surgery

01:55.400 --> 01:58.300
There is no question that at some
point they will be persons like anyone else

01:58.500 --> 02:01.400
They will not be human, but that they will be part
of our community?

02:01.800 --> 02:03.200
There is no question
in my mind.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.800
The decision came down 5 to 4

02:06.300 --> 02:09.699
That the Supreme Court ruled in favor
of the use of surrogates in daily life.

02:14.600 --> 02:17.300
Right now, we are witnessing an
event

02:17.500 --> 02:19.600
That is of an evolutionary significance

02:19.800 --> 02:21.700
7 years ago

02:22.500 --> 02:25.600
According to VSI, the industries
leading manufacturer,

02:25.900 --> 02:28.300
over 98% of world population

02:28.500 --> 02:31.700
uses a surrogate in all
facets of their daily life

02:35.100 --> 02:39.700
We're in the midst of profound
changes that are things that were once
unimaginable have become inevitable

02:40.400 --> 02:42.600
Since the global embrace of surrogacy

02:42.800 --> 02:44.900
crime rates have dropped
to record lows

02:45.400 --> 02:48.100
We have witnessed and incredible
reduction in violent crime

02:48.600 --> 02:50.900
communicable disease and discrimination.

02:51.100 --> 02:53.700
Problems that have plagued
societies for centuries

02:54.200 --> 02:55.800
solved almost overnight.

02:55.900 --> 02:57.300
We are the creators.

02:57.600 --> 02:59.600
We will be making them

02:59.800 --> 03:01.500
Do everything for us.All in one machine.

03:01.800 --> 03:03.700
3 years ago

03:04.800 --> 03:07.600
But there is a minority who
actively oppose Surrogates

03:07.800 --> 03:09.700
And are moving to limit their use.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.100
Many people will see this

03:14.300 --> 03:17.600
as the invasion of the inhuman.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.800
They've established reservations or
Surrogacy free zones

03:22.000 --> 03:24.100
in major cities around the country.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.200
They are led by Zaire Powell

03:30.300 --> 03:32.200
or as he is better known
to his followers

03:32.400 --> 03:33.300
The Prophet.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.800
Those machines walking around out there

03:36.100 --> 03:37.500
They're a lie.

03:41.400 --> 03:44.000
You have been sold a lie.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.000
Presend Day

03:54.900 --> 03:56.900
You're going to love Tosca

03:57.100 --> 04:00.000
- Alright, but don't tell me how it ends.
- The way they all end.

04:00.300 --> 04:02.200
Everyone dies.

04:04.100 --> 04:07.000
I'm so glad you could
come back east for a visit.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.800
Well... anything for a break from exams.

04:10.600 --> 04:11.900
We're almost there.

04:12.400 --> 04:14.400
Listen... thanks for lending it to me.

04:14.900 --> 04:16.300
Have a wonderful time.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.500
I love you.

04:18.700 --> 04:20.300
I love you too Dad.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.600
You know Armando

04:30.900 --> 04:32.500
I'm not really in the mood for opera

04:33.900 --> 04:35.000
Four Point?

04:36.300 --> 04:37.700
You read my mind.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.000
Get lost meat bag

07:14.200 --> 07:15.500
I'm agent Peters.

07:16.200 --> 07:18.500
This is Agent Greer... FBI.

07:19.100 --> 07:22.600
Yeah... some jackass on a motorcycle
wiped out a bunch of units

07:22.800 --> 07:24.200
So what do you need us for?

07:24.700 --> 07:27.200
Well I was going to file just a vandalism report

07:27.400 --> 07:29.400
but it turns out this unit's unregistered.

07:36.700 --> 07:38.700
Looks like it's going to need new optics

07:39.400 --> 07:40.500
No shit

07:53.600 --> 07:55.700
The memory chip is completely fried.

07:56.600 --> 07:57.700
Whatya got on the girl?

07:57.900 --> 08:00.100
Registered to a
Cameron McAllister.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.500
He file a report?

08:02.800 --> 08:05.400
No, that's just it, no calls, no nothin'

08:19.800 --> 08:21.100
Come on.

08:21.600 --> 08:23.500
Let's go talk to
our operator.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.000
Cam?

08:37.900 --> 08:39.400
Maybe nobody's home.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.100
My Surries in for an upgrade

08:46.300 --> 08:47.400
and they gave me this crappy loaner.

08:47.700 --> 08:48.700
Could you?

08:49.200 --> 08:49.900
Certainly.

08:59.100 --> 09:00.100
Cam?

09:02.400 --> 09:06.000
Cam's a good tenant you know, pays the
rent on time, never leaves the apartment.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.600
Cam?

09:25.300 --> 09:26.900
Cam?

09:28.700 --> 09:30.000
Oh my God!

09:32.600 --> 09:34.200
Don't touch anything, please.

09:42.800 --> 09:44.300
I'll call it in.

09:45.900 --> 09:48.500
- You're sure this is Cameron McAllister?
- Yes!

09:55.300 --> 09:58.200
This is Agent Peters, we
tracked down the operator.

10:00.800 --> 10:01.500
Yeah

10:03.400 --> 10:04.700
Better send a coroner

10:09.300 --> 10:10.900
Connection interrupted.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.500
Have you ever seen anything like this?

13:11.100 --> 13:12.100
Morning

13:13.600 --> 13:14.400
Where's your....

13:15.000 --> 13:16.300
In the... charge room.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.900
You pull another all nighter?

13:32.000 --> 13:32.800
Yes I did

13:35.900 --> 13:37.400
Why don't you think about taking a break?

13:38.500 --> 13:39.600
- A break?
- Mmmmhmmm

13:40.600 --> 13:42.300
I got some vacation time saved up

13:42.900 --> 13:44.000
How about Hawaii?

13:44.800 --> 13:46.200
Lisa said she got an amazing deal

13:46.500 --> 13:47.400
Hawaii would be great

13:47.500 --> 13:51.600
She had this totally buff Surrie in Maui,
She took it surfing, parasailing, deep sea diving.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.500
You know that rental place on Boilston?

13:54.700 --> 13:57.900
I was thinking about US.
You and me going away some place together.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.400
And leave our units at home?
Are you kidding?

14:03.700 --> 14:07.400
- We could take a drive out to the Cape?
We haven't done that for a while...
- Could talk about this another time?

14:08.300 --> 14:11.800
You now I should get to work, the
shops been really busy, everyone
wants me to look for somewhere and...

14:15.300 --> 14:17.300
Yeah... I was just thinking that...
Ummm...

14:19.500 --> 14:20.900
It just feels like we...

14:22.600 --> 14:26.100
- Haven't really spent much time together lately.
- We're together every day.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.100
Surrogates...
Not the same...

14:34.100 --> 14:35.300
It's better.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.800
College West, San Diego.

14:52.100 --> 14:53.600
Yo Canter?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.300
He's been in there all weekend.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.500
He's gonna miss the Psych final.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.600
Jesus!

15:04.000 --> 15:05.400
Someone call the cops!

15:06.800 --> 15:09.300
We are confronted by an
unprecedented situation.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.800
Two people have died while
connected to their stim chairs.

15:15.300 --> 15:19.100
According to the pathologist,
their brains were liquefied in their skulls.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.600
What ever happened to
their surrogates, killed them.

15:24.800 --> 15:25.600
Sir?

15:26.100 --> 15:28.500
- How's it even possible?
- We don't know.

15:30.100 --> 15:32.000
I'm imposing a total media blackout.

15:32.300 --> 15:36.600
No one in this office is going to be responsible
for setting off a nationwide panic.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.700
The public cannot be allowed to get the idea
that using a surrogate can be fatal.

15:46.900 --> 15:49.300
Tuxedo boys last moments.

15:51.700 --> 15:53.200
Get lost meat bag.

15:56.600 --> 15:59.200
- Looks like we got ourselves a witness.
- Mmmmhmm.

16:06.300 --> 16:07.400
Hang on...

16:12.000 --> 16:14.100
- What is that?
- Exactly...

16:17.600 --> 16:19.800
- Some kind of weapon.
- Anything yet?

16:20.700 --> 16:24.200
Hang on to yourself, I think
we may actually have a homicide here.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.000
Come here and look at this.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.700
- Are you serious?
- No we don't know that for sure.

16:29.100 --> 16:32.600
Yeah but what if it is a homicide?
When was the last one?

16:33.800 --> 16:35.100
This could be huge.

16:39.300 --> 16:41.500
- Yeah, Lee go.
- We got your next of kin.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.300
I hope you're sitting down.

16:43.800 --> 16:45.900
The kids father is Lionel Canter.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.800
As in the inventor of surrogates, Lionel Canter.

16:51.800 --> 16:55.000
Jarid Canter,
son of Dr. Lionel Canter was found dead

16:55.300 --> 16:57.800
In his Southern California
dormitory this morning

16:58.000 --> 16:59.900
Cause of death
remains unknown.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.400
A college sophmore, Jarid
was the only son

17:02.600 --> 17:05.599
of the man known around the world
as the father of surrogacy.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.000
The Former Chairman of VSI

17:08.300 --> 17:11.400
Shaped it into one of the largest
corporations in the world.

17:11.599 --> 17:14.500
However, a split between
Canter and his VSI partners

17:14.800 --> 17:16.599
Over the direction of the company

17:16.800 --> 17:19.099
Led to Canters firing
seven years ago.

17:19.900 --> 17:23.099
Publicly humiliated and forced out
of the company he helped to build

17:23.700 --> 17:26.400
Canter has since remained
absent from the public eye.

17:28.600 --> 17:30.200
Dr. Canter's expecting you.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.200
He actually lives here?

17:32.400 --> 17:33.300
I didn't say that.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.700
You'll be speaking with
one of his surrogates.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.800
I work for Dr. Canter.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.700
His private elevator is this way.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.700
Please, wait in here.

18:05.600 --> 18:06.900
What a nice place.

18:07.700 --> 18:08.900
It should be.

18:10.200 --> 18:12.500
It's a piece of every surrogate they sell.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.500
Dr. Canter?

18:22.100 --> 18:22.900
That's right.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.500
You're with the FBI?

18:25.400 --> 18:26.300
Yes we are.

18:27.100 --> 18:28.000
This way.

18:29.100 --> 18:31.400
I can't help but notice the similarities between

18:31.600 --> 18:34.500
your surrogate... and the
one your son Jared was using.

18:35.400 --> 18:38.000
I never really knew
Jarid as a child.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.500
He grew up with his mother in California
Who kept him from me.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.700
When he went to college I encourage him
to borrow my surrogates whenever he wanted.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.400
How did you managed to do that?

18:48.800 --> 18:51.000
A Surrie has to be coded
to your neural signature.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.900
I am not exactly your
average VSI consumer.

18:58.700 --> 19:01.100
This was just a way for me
to spend time with my son.

19:01.400 --> 19:04.800
It's a felony to inhabit a surrogate
registered to another operator.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.600
No offense Dr. Canter.
We're just trying to straighten out our facts.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.500
What is this?

19:11.400 --> 19:13.400
- Some kind of Good Cop, Bad Cop routine?
- No sir.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.900
- You tryin' to handle me?
- No sir.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.600
Because I'm not going to be handled.

19:16.900 --> 19:17.900
Dr Canter...

19:18.500 --> 19:20.600
- I know how you must feel.
- Do you?

19:21.500 --> 19:22.600
Yes, sir.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.400
I lost a son myself.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.500
Do you have any idea why
someone might want to harm Jared?

19:45.900 --> 19:46.700
No.

19:47.700 --> 19:48.600
Or yourself?

19:54.400 --> 19:55.500
Oh my God.

19:57.100 --> 19:58.800
If it was me they were after...

20:00.400 --> 20:02.500
I'm responsible for my sons death.

20:10.700 --> 20:13.500
Well... I guess the interview's over.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.200
No!

20:37.400 --> 20:41.200
<i>Robotic surrogates combine
the durability of machines</i>

20:41.500 --> 20:44.000
<i>With the grace and beauty
of the human form</i>

20:44.400 --> 20:46.000
<i>To make your life safer</i>

20:46.300 --> 20:47.200
<i>And better.</i>

20:47.400 --> 20:49.600
<i>Whether you're....</i>

20:50.900 --> 20:54.400
<i>Get ready to live your life without any
risk or danger.</i>

20:55.100 --> 20:57.500
<i>You can live your life
without limitations.</i>

20:58.700 --> 21:01.100
<i>And become anyone you want to be.</i>

21:01.300 --> 21:03.800
<i>From the comfort and
safety of your own home.</i>

21:04.200 --> 21:06.600
<i>VSI, where it all began.</i>

21:07.400 --> 21:10.000
<i>Do what you want.
Be what you want.</i>

21:11.700 --> 21:13.600
Agents Greer and Peters?
I'm Victor Welsh.

21:14.200 --> 21:15.600
VP of corporate relations.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.500
Please Sit.

21:17.900 --> 21:20.800
- Thanks for taking the time to see us.
- No problem.

21:21.900 --> 21:24.000
You uh... You must know Andy Stone?

21:24.300 --> 21:25.600
Our immediate superior.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.200
Do give him my regards.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.600
- We're from the legal department.
- Hope you don't mind if we sit in.

21:30.900 --> 21:31.600
Not at all.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.200
The two of you might be interested
in a free software upgrade we're
offering all law enforcement officials.

21:35.900 --> 21:39.000
Better night vision.
Improved pursuit capability.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.600
You have any idea how a surrogates
head would explode from the inside?

21:47.300 --> 21:50.000
Mr. Welsh isn't qualified
to answer that question.

21:50.300 --> 21:51.800
What do the operators say?

21:52.200 --> 21:53.200
Not much.

21:53.800 --> 21:54.700
They're dead.

21:54.900 --> 21:58.900
If you're trying to imply a link between VSI
products and an operators accidental death...

21:59.100 --> 22:00.300
I'm not implying anything.

22:01.500 --> 22:04.800
I just want to know how an operator
can be killed by signals from it's surrogate.

22:05.100 --> 22:06.700
This idea itself is absurd.

22:06.900 --> 22:09.900
If it were possible it would defeat
the entire purpose of surrogacy.

22:10.500 --> 22:13.100
Surries have jumped from bridges...
Been shot....

22:13.600 --> 22:16.100
Even... blown to bits without the
least bit of harm to their operators.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.700
The failsafes always kick in.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.700
I can assure you VSI's products have the most
stringent safety standards in the industry.

22:23.200 --> 22:24.600
What about a human head?

22:25.700 --> 22:27.200
What would cause one of them to blow up?

22:27.900 --> 22:28.900
Agent Greer...

22:29.600 --> 22:30.300
We're not doctors.

22:31.400 --> 22:32.100
Honey...

22:32.500 --> 22:33.900
I don't know WHAT you are.

22:34.900 --> 22:39.200
I mean for all I know you could be
some big fat dude sitting in a stim
chair with his dick hanging out.

22:58.900 --> 23:00.600
Interesting technique.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.900
I hate lawyers.

23:09.200 --> 23:10.300
What are you doing?

23:26.000 --> 23:27.300
Mr. Steinberg?

23:28.700 --> 23:30.300
Seth Steinberg?

23:34.000 --> 23:34.800
Hello.

23:35.100 --> 23:36.000
Sorry.

23:36.200 --> 23:37.300
I was in the can.

23:37.500 --> 23:39.700
Agent Peters, I'm Agent Greer with the FBI.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.200
Really?

23:44.700 --> 23:46.500
You know with any chip this damaged...

23:46.900 --> 23:49.000
Every circuit must have fired off at once.

23:49.400 --> 23:50.400
Kablooey!

23:51.100 --> 23:53.000
Have you ever seen anything like this before?

23:53.400 --> 23:57.100
Last week a truck load of GI Joes
did come back for re-conditioning.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.300
And a couple of the
Surries were missing optics.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.200
Mind if we take a look at them?

24:17.300 --> 24:18.600
Here we go.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.700
No bullet holes?
No blast damage?

24:33.500 --> 24:35.800
No scratches.
No dirt. No mud.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.400
Mind if I check out the identity chip?

24:39.400 --> 24:41.000
- Heh. Yeah.
- Why not?

24:41.600 --> 24:42.500
Didn't come back with one.

25:03.300 --> 25:04.200
I'm down!

25:04.500 --> 25:05.300
I'm down.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.600
Damn things aren't free Polaski!
Take the snipers from behind this time.

25:08.900 --> 25:09.700
Yes sir!

25:11.300 --> 25:12.500
Back online.

25:27.200 --> 25:28.300
Follow me.

25:29.400 --> 25:31.400
- Keep an eye on Bravo Company.
- Go kick some ass sir!

25:31.800 --> 25:34.200
Agent Greer you're wasting
your time with these questions.

25:35.100 --> 25:38.800
Why on earth would the Defense
Department want to develop a weapon
that could wipe out our own troops?

25:39.800 --> 25:41.600
So no such weapon exists...

25:41.900 --> 25:43.800
If it did, I'd know about it.

25:44.300 --> 25:45.900
And the soldier that we saw?

25:46.100 --> 25:49.100
We routinely remove motherboards
and optics for analysis.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.100
Now if you'll excuse me.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.200
I've got to move a Peace Keeping operation.

26:01.300 --> 26:03.200
- Check your screen
- What?

26:03.400 --> 26:04.500
Myles Strickland.

26:04.700 --> 26:05.300
Who?

26:05.400 --> 26:07.500
Myles Strickland, beat that!

26:08.000 --> 26:11.200
I did a run on criminal records

26:11.400 --> 26:12.400
Guess what I found?

26:12.700 --> 26:14.400
He's already in the system.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.800
He was arrested a month ago
for multiple counts of armed robbery.

26:18.600 --> 26:20.200
And what's really weird about this...

26:20.900 --> 26:23.300
After he was busted...
They let him off.

26:23.900 --> 26:25.700
Someone on the inside's protecting him.

26:26.100 --> 26:28.000
But I put out an APB anyway.

26:43.700 --> 26:45.400
Visual matching.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.500
- Cameras caught your guy.
- Where?

27:00.700 --> 27:02.700
Dorchester, Gore Park and Adams.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.500
Not far from the reservation.

27:04.800 --> 27:06.900
Boston PD is on its way.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.100
Stay here.
Keep tabs on him.

27:09.300 --> 27:10.800
Wait a minute where are you going?

27:11.100 --> 27:12.500
Dorchester.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.100
It wasn't too difficult.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.100
I put his face in the system and... Bingo!
We found him in an alley.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.200
K33 over there brought it to my attention.

27:21.500 --> 27:22.700
Thanks Jerry.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.700
He's one of our best watchers.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.400
He's semi-retired.

27:27.700 --> 27:29.800
So he gets to work out of
his beach house in Maine.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.600
- Pretty sweet huh?
- Yeah, it's a nice setup you have here.

27:33.100 --> 27:35.300
Yeah, we can access every
Surrie on the grid here.

27:36.300 --> 27:37.600
Touch a button.

27:38.100 --> 27:39.900
I can tap into anyone's feed.

27:40.600 --> 27:42.500
It's kinda like being inside Gods head.

27:44.300 --> 27:46.400
Ooooooh Boy... I felt that one coming.

27:47.600 --> 27:48.800
My name's Saunders by the way.

27:50.700 --> 27:52.000
Jennifer Peters.

27:52.600 --> 27:54.900
Yeah... Yeah you are aren't you?

27:56.300 --> 27:57.600
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hmmm?

27:58.800 --> 27:59.900
Why no surrogate?

28:00.400 --> 28:01.300
Me?

28:02.300 --> 28:04.000
They've been trying to puppet me for years.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.300
But they ain't built a machine
that can handle this big puppy yet.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.500
Excuse me a second...

28:11.600 --> 28:13.300
We have an assault and
battery in progress.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.500
I need warrants to shut
them down immediately.

28:16.100 --> 28:18.300
Charlie 4639er.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.800
Sierra 7855

28:21.200 --> 28:24.500
Let's see if they have a
security camera in the hotel...

28:26.500 --> 28:27.700
Looks like there is one.

28:30.300 --> 28:31.800
Warrant recieved.

28:32.500 --> 28:33.600
Agent Peters...

28:34.200 --> 28:35.400
Watch this.

28:36.100 --> 28:36.700
Boom.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.200
Boom.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.300
Since when have you been
able to cut off operators?

28:41.800 --> 28:44.200
It's brand new software.
I call it buffering.

28:44.400 --> 28:46.300
Let's me disconnect anyone
from their surrogate.

28:46.500 --> 28:48.200
Well that can't be legal?

28:48.300 --> 28:49.800
Ahhh... It's a grey area.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.800
They don't ask, we don't tell.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.100
It's pretty cool huh?

28:54.500 --> 28:55.600
Awww C'mon.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.500
Relax, we're the
good guys.

29:12.300 --> 29:18.000
Suspect on a bike heading east of
South Hampton up a mile from the Res'

29:18.400 --> 29:22.400
Greer, be careful, you're heading
straight towards Dread territory. We
don't have jurisdiction to fly over there.

29:22.600 --> 29:23.800
It's restricted air space.

29:24.900 --> 29:26.200
Greer are you there?

30:27.000 --> 30:27.900
Freeze!

30:34.400 --> 30:35.900
What was that?

30:40.200 --> 30:41.700
Agghhh!

32:18.900 --> 32:20.600
Fire! Fire!

34:14.699 --> 34:17.000
I ain't done nothin'!
I ain't done nothin'!

34:19.100 --> 34:20.400
Give me the bag.

34:22.300 --> 34:23.400
Throw it over here.

34:25.199 --> 34:26.800
Throw it over here.
Now!

34:55.500 --> 34:56.800
You're an abomination.

34:57.700 --> 34:58.800
Oh god.

35:25.500 --> 35:27.300
Maggie.

35:28.900 --> 35:30.200
Maggie!

35:32.400 --> 35:34.900
Lionel Canter is on the phone.
He's called for Greer a half dozen times.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.600
I can't deal with this right now.

35:36.800 --> 35:39.200
- He's pretty upset.
- Just tell him someone will call him back.

35:39.400 --> 35:40.000
Peters!

35:40.600 --> 35:42.400
You gotta believe me
I tried to stop him.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.600
Well you didn't try hard enough.
You're done for the day.

35:44.800 --> 35:45.700
Clock out.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.700
Oh you're kidding!

36:26.000 --> 36:27.000
God.

36:28.800 --> 36:29.400
Tom?

36:31.600 --> 36:32.500
Oh my God!

36:32.800 --> 36:34.100
Call an ambulance!

36:50.200 --> 36:51.700
Myles Strickland is it?

36:53.500 --> 36:54.900
Why are you...

37:02.800 --> 37:04.000
What's goin' on?

37:04.100 --> 37:05.100
Who was it?

37:05.700 --> 37:07.100
Who gave you the weapon?

37:07.800 --> 37:09.100
And paid you to use it?

37:10.600 --> 37:11.700
I don't know!

37:11.900 --> 37:13.400
Myles you can't lie to me.

37:13.900 --> 37:14.900
I'm not lyin'.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.800
I swear to God sir, I'm not lying.

37:17.600 --> 37:18.900
He never told me his name.

37:19.200 --> 37:20.900
We talked on disposable cell phones.

37:21.100 --> 37:22.400
I never saw
his face.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.600
I couldn't tell you who he
was if my life depended on it!

37:29.700 --> 37:31.500
A Police chase through Dorchester concluded

37:31.700 --> 37:34.400
with an FBI helicopter crash landing

37:34.700 --> 37:36.800
inside Bostons' Dread Reservation

37:37.000 --> 37:39.400
Residents of the Reservation are outraged

37:39.600 --> 37:41.200
over what they're calling

37:41.400 --> 37:44.700
a gross violation of their territorial sovereignity.

37:44.900 --> 37:46.900
Human Coalition Leader, The Prophet

37:47.300 --> 37:50.600
responded in a statement made earlier today.

37:51.100 --> 37:52.600
They've attacked us.

37:52.800 --> 37:56.400
Declared War on our way of
life and left us with one option:

37:57.000 --> 37:58.100
Revolution!

37:58.500 --> 38:02.000
We did not throw the first stone.
But we will throw the last.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.100
Hi.

38:12.100 --> 38:12.900
Hey.

38:14.800 --> 38:15.900
How's the headache?

38:16.700 --> 38:17.900
Still there.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.200
- Thanks for being here.
- Of course.

38:22.700 --> 38:24.600
<i>Imagine a World where
children are always safe.</i>

38:25.600 --> 38:27.100
<i>a world where every child</i>

38:27.300 --> 38:29.300
<i>and every parent is secure.</i>

38:30.000 --> 38:32.400
<i>Make every childhood a happy one.</i>

38:33.600 --> 38:35.100
<i>Surrogates for kids.</i>

38:35.500 --> 38:39.200
<i>Exclusively from VSI.
Where it all Beg...</i>

38:44.600 --> 38:46.900
- Knock Knock. Hey.
- Andy. Hi.

38:47.700 --> 38:48.700
Oh my gosh.

38:49.200 --> 38:51.100
- I haven't seen you forever.
- I know.

38:51.300 --> 38:52.800
I should let you guys talk.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.200
- Will you be okay?
- Mmmhmm

38:56.900 --> 38:58.000
See you tomorrow morning.

38:59.100 --> 39:00.000
Bye.

39:00.400 --> 39:01.100
Bye.

39:06.700 --> 39:07.700
How bad?

39:08.200 --> 39:10.300
The doctor said you're
lucky to be alive.

39:10.900 --> 39:12.400
Good thing you unplugged.

39:14.200 --> 39:15.700
You gotta go get him.

39:16.200 --> 39:17.700
Stricklands got that weapon.

39:18.300 --> 39:19.500
You just get a court order...

39:19.700 --> 39:22.300
There won't be any court
orders, you've been suspended.

39:22.900 --> 39:23.700
For what?

39:23.800 --> 39:27.000
- Tom, you violated our treaty with the Dreads.
- Forget the Treaty!

39:27.500 --> 39:28.600
He killed 5 cops!

39:28.700 --> 39:31.400
Look... I'm gonna take care
of this case myself personally. Alright?

39:32.500 --> 39:36.800
Now... I'm afraid the bureau won't
be able to supply you with a new
surrogate until after the official inquiry.

39:37.900 --> 39:39.600
Same goes for your
gun and your badge.

39:40.500 --> 39:41.900
Don't think about this now.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.700
He killed 5 cops Andy.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.300
Take some time to heal.

40:29.300 --> 40:30.000
Hey.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.500
- Hey.
- Sorry I'm late.

40:32.600 --> 40:33.500
That's ok.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.800
Wow... You look a lot
like your synth.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.200
Yeah

40:40.000 --> 40:40.800
Should we go?

40:47.800 --> 40:50.300
How long has it been since you've
been out without a Surrie?

40:51.300 --> 40:52.700
I can't even remember.

40:57.100 --> 40:59.500
I can't believe they didn't give
you something for the axiety.

41:15.000 --> 41:15.800
Greer?

41:16.600 --> 41:18.000
- Look... This isn't gonna work.
- I'm fine.

41:18.900 --> 41:20.100
I have an idea.

41:44.300 --> 41:45.700
Come on... This is
a really bad idea...

41:45.900 --> 41:48.000
It's gonna be alright. I'm sure
we'll find you something decent.

41:56.900 --> 41:59.400
Now we're gonna have you
back on your feet in a sec.

42:01.800 --> 42:03.000
Sync looks good.

42:03.300 --> 42:04.700
It's responding well to signal, right?

42:06.900 --> 42:08.000
It feels numb.

42:08.300 --> 42:09.600
It's only a base model.

42:10.100 --> 42:11.200
It comes with vision and hearing.

42:11.400 --> 42:13.300
If you want other senses
they're extra.

42:13.700 --> 42:17.000
Of course if you like seeing your own
face when you look in the mirror, no problem.

42:17.600 --> 42:19.900
I'll just scan your head, cast the thermo plastic

42:20.100 --> 42:21.700
and you're good to go
in less than an hour.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.600
Hey no charge on the improvements.

42:24.300 --> 42:26.100
I'm sure you wouldn't mind taking yourself back

42:26.300 --> 42:28.700
5, 10 years, huh?
What do you think of that?

42:29.600 --> 42:30.900
- Hmmm?
- I think we're done here.

42:37.000 --> 42:37.800
Greer.

42:44.900 --> 42:45.800
Tom.

42:46.700 --> 42:47.500
Tom.

42:48.300 --> 42:50.900
Tom you can't come out
here by yourself. It's not safe.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.800
- I'm fine.
- Let me take you home.

42:53.000 --> 42:54.800
I'm not going home.

42:55.300 --> 42:57.500
Tom. We gotta forget the case.

42:58.000 --> 43:00.100
Stone is going to run things his way

43:00.300 --> 43:02.600
and as far as we're concerned, it's over.

43:02.800 --> 43:05.700
It's not over until we
get that weapon back.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.200
Then you gotta let me help you.

43:11.900 --> 43:14.000
I'm not gonna let you win.

43:14.200 --> 43:15.700
Take care of yourself Peters.

44:04.400 --> 44:07.200
Death came to Myles Strickland

44:08.600 --> 44:11.200
As death comes to all men.

44:12.400 --> 44:13.600
But for Myles

44:14.800 --> 44:16.300
It's not an ending.

44:17.800 --> 44:19.500
It's a new beginning.

44:21.400 --> 44:24.900
When you sacrifice your
own personal desires

44:26.900 --> 44:28.400
for a greater cause, a greater good.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.400
You never die.

44:32.700 --> 44:34.300
You never disappear.

44:35.500 --> 44:38.000
That is what it means to be human.

44:39.700 --> 44:41.300
There is no alternative

44:41.900 --> 44:44.700
You can try to escape by
living through a puppet

44:45.400 --> 44:47.100
Through a machine.

44:47.800 --> 44:51.800
But deep down inside, you
know you're living a lie

44:54.200 --> 44:56.400
Here, inside these walls

44:56.700 --> 44:58.500
We understand the truth.

45:05.000 --> 45:08.500
We sacrifice many modern
pleasures and conveniences

45:08.800 --> 45:10.900
to feel truly connected.

45:12.100 --> 45:13.500
Not with machines

45:16.100 --> 45:17.200
But with ourselves.

45:22.500 --> 45:24.400
This is the human condition.

45:24.800 --> 45:26.900
This is what gives life meaning.

45:27.900 --> 45:28.800
My friends.

45:29.200 --> 45:32.700
Soon the day will come
when surrogacy must end.

45:33.600 --> 45:35.500
That day, I promise you

45:36.200 --> 45:37.400
Is close at hand.

45:38.200 --> 45:41.000
The day... we get a second chance.

46:11.200 --> 46:12.300
Excuse me.

46:14.300 --> 46:15.600
- Can I help you?
- Yeah

46:15.900 --> 46:17.700
I'd like to speak to
The Prohet for a minute.

46:18.100 --> 46:19.500
You and everybody else bud, no.

46:19.900 --> 46:21.500
You some kind of cop or somethin'?

46:22.000 --> 46:23.500
You have no jurisdiction here.

46:23.700 --> 46:25.600
Can I talk to you
about Myles Strickland please?

46:30.800 --> 46:31.800
Enough.

46:35.400 --> 46:37.800
It's different when you actually feel the pain.

46:38.700 --> 46:39.500
Isn't it?

46:41.700 --> 46:43.300
What happened to Strickland?

46:45.400 --> 46:47.000
Was he a friend of yours?

46:47.600 --> 46:48.600
He had a weapon.

46:49.100 --> 46:50.800
A very dangerous weapon.

46:52.200 --> 46:54.600
My people will do
anything to get this back.

46:57.500 --> 47:01.900
Well... if I happen to come
across such a weapon

47:03.400 --> 47:06.000
I promise to have it
delivered to your door.

47:07.900 --> 47:09.600
Show him to the gates.

47:11.400 --> 47:12.400
Gently.

47:55.900 --> 47:57.000
Agent Greer.

47:57.600 --> 47:59.400
May I offer you a ride?

48:03.000 --> 48:04.800
You'll have to excuse my appearance.

48:05.200 --> 48:07.700
It's not safe for me to
use my usual surrogates.

48:09.400 --> 48:10.300
Dr. Canter.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.200
This is one of VSI's newer models.

48:13.300 --> 48:14.600
How long have you been following me?

48:14.800 --> 48:18.200
Long enough to know you're getting
nowhere solving my sons murder.

48:21.700 --> 48:23.300
You lost a child Agent Greer?

48:25.000 --> 48:25.700
How?

48:29.300 --> 48:30.800
Car accident.

48:35.900 --> 48:37.400
It was just an accident.

48:39.200 --> 48:40.200
I'm sorry.

48:45.200 --> 48:48.700
I can think of no worse tragedy
than a parent outliving a child.

48:53.400 --> 48:54.700
All I can tell you

48:56.200 --> 48:58.000
is that the man who killed your son is dead.

48:58.800 --> 49:00.300
His name was Myles Strickland.

49:01.100 --> 49:02.600
Lived on the Res'.

49:04.600 --> 49:06.100
He was killed by his own people.

49:06.800 --> 49:07.700
And that's it?

49:08.300 --> 49:09.300
Case solved?

49:10.600 --> 49:12.700
One man didn't act on his own.

49:14.100 --> 49:15.500
Whatever killed my son

49:15.700 --> 49:18.700
was an extraordinary
sophisticated technology.

49:19.100 --> 49:21.500
Far beyond the capabilites of the Dreads.

49:22.200 --> 49:24.900
We're talking about a
billion dollar weapons project.

49:25.900 --> 49:28.100
Who do you know spends money like that?

49:38.300 --> 49:41.000
Focus on the weapon, where it came from.

49:58.400 --> 49:59.700
Mmmm do me.

50:05.900 --> 50:07.700
How was it?

50:18.000 --> 50:20.400
- Hey Maggie?
- No, thank you.

50:20.900 --> 50:22.700
Come on... it'll take the edge off.

50:32.100 --> 50:33.800
Tom?
Honey?

50:38.300 --> 50:39.900
I thought you were still in the hospital?

50:40.400 --> 50:41.100
Yeah...

50:42.200 --> 50:43.300
I can see that.

50:43.600 --> 50:44.800
What happened?

50:46.800 --> 50:50.100
Tom I don't want you going out
without your Surrie ever again.

50:50.300 --> 50:53.500
- Tom?
- You look very nice, Sexy.

50:53.800 --> 50:56.100
Ok... Don't start.
I'm sorry, those guys...

50:56.400 --> 50:59.500
They're friends of Brigettes, she brought
them over, she wanted to go to this party...

50:59.800 --> 51:00.900
I didn't even want to go.

51:01.200 --> 51:02.800
How long have you been jacking?

51:02.900 --> 51:04.000
I don't.

51:05.800 --> 51:07.100
I don't do it Tom.

51:07.200 --> 51:09.200
And what does it matter if I did?
Why are you being like this?

51:10.100 --> 51:11.400
Okay go have a good time.

51:48.400 --> 51:49.800
Tom stop it!

52:11.700 --> 52:12.700
Tom?

52:13.800 --> 52:15.100
Tom, what was that?

52:17.100 --> 52:18.900
- What?
- What you want from me?

52:26.200 --> 52:27.300
I want you...

52:28.800 --> 52:30.100
...My wife.

52:31.800 --> 52:33.300
I am your wife.

52:33.400 --> 52:34.800
And you won't see it.

52:35.500 --> 52:36.500
No. God.

52:37.800 --> 52:38.600
No you're not.

52:41.600 --> 52:44.400
Not...
Not... this.

52:45.200 --> 52:47.600
Not this... thing...
This...

52:52.100 --> 52:53.300
I just want you.

52:55.200 --> 52:57.400
And I want the woman that's in that room.

52:57.700 --> 52:58.800
My wife.

53:03.100 --> 53:04.700
Things have changed Tom.

53:05.000 --> 53:07.000
You're... No you've changed.
You're just scared.

53:07.200 --> 53:09.200
You're just scared...
We could go talk to somebody...

53:10.400 --> 53:13.300
Maggie...
Maggie your my wife.

54:14.100 --> 54:16.700
Agent Greer?
Is that... Is that you?

54:17.400 --> 54:18.100
Yeah.

54:18.900 --> 54:22.200
- You look... You look terrible.
- Thanks you too.

55:06.600 --> 55:09.500
The chips completely fried.
What do you got on the girl?

55:10.000 --> 55:11.900
Come on...
Let's go talk to her Op.

55:13.600 --> 55:15.600
We can we access any Surrie in the grid.

55:16.400 --> 55:19.100
Touch of a Button, I can
tap into anyones feed.

55:36.900 --> 55:39.300
Transfer to remote operator.

55:58.500 --> 55:59.500
I wish I could help.

55:59.900 --> 56:01.300
This thing killed 5 cops.

56:01.800 --> 56:04.300
One of my men.
Almost put me in the ground.

56:05.100 --> 56:08.000
I know it's a weapon.
I want to know what kind.

56:08.200 --> 56:11.300
- You're asking me to compromise highly
classified information... - I know where it is.

56:12.200 --> 56:13.100
Where is it?

56:14.200 --> 56:14.900
Right...

56:22.900 --> 56:24.300
Is called an O.D.

56:25.100 --> 56:26.600
Overload Device.

56:28.200 --> 56:31.000
The idea was to end
the battle with one shot.

56:32.400 --> 56:34.700
Giving the software virus straight to the CPU.

56:35.200 --> 56:37.100
Disables the Surries instantly.

56:37.700 --> 56:40.800
We didn't know the virus would
defeat the built in failsafes.

56:42.300 --> 56:43.500
...kill the operators.

56:43.800 --> 56:45.100
Who makes it?

56:47.100 --> 56:48.200
VSI.

56:50.300 --> 56:51.400
After the test

56:53.100 --> 56:54.600
the project was scrapped.

56:55.700 --> 56:57.100
Every unit was destroyed.

56:57.700 --> 56:59.100
Except this one right?

57:02.000 --> 57:02.900
Where is it?

57:04.000 --> 57:05.900
Right now it's in the hands
of the Human Coalition.

57:06.000 --> 57:07.600
- How long have they had it?
- A day...

57:07.800 --> 57:09.000
Maybe two.

57:10.700 --> 57:12.100
This is out of your hands.

57:12.700 --> 57:14.400
Military will handle this.

57:22.200 --> 57:24.200
- You called for us?
- Take this to

57:24.600 --> 57:26.500
the federal building downtown.

57:27.600 --> 57:29.000
A woman will meet you there.

57:29.700 --> 57:31.600
Agent Jennifer Peters.

57:32.200 --> 57:35.100
You're to give it to her... and her alone.

57:43.400 --> 57:44.300
Peters.

57:45.300 --> 57:46.300
What are you doing?

57:47.100 --> 57:49.000
Just a background check on VSI.

57:49.700 --> 57:50.900
Structural stuff.

57:51.100 --> 57:53.100
Those are internal financial records.

57:53.700 --> 57:55.200
Talk to Jenkins in corporate.

57:56.100 --> 57:56.900
6th Floor.

58:02.100 --> 58:03.700
Don't forget the cheek bones.

58:05.900 --> 58:07.800
Okay, honey.
Face off.

58:20.200 --> 58:21.200
Maggs.

58:28.700 --> 58:29.700
Hiya Tom.

58:32.500 --> 58:35.100
Those ugh... Smile muscles need to set.

58:38.300 --> 58:39.900
- Hey.
- Hi.

58:41.400 --> 58:42.800
I'm sorry about last night.

58:43.900 --> 58:44.900
I'm at work Tom.

58:45.300 --> 58:47.300
- I didn't come here to argue.
- Good.

58:51.900 --> 58:54.100
See I feel like I've gone crazy.

58:58.100 --> 58:59.400
It's...
I just...

59:01.300 --> 59:02.600
I love you.

59:03.700 --> 59:06.400
I love this smart, beautiful

59:07.300 --> 59:09.100
Intelligent, funny

59:10.400 --> 59:11.500
Woman... And...

59:13.800 --> 59:15.000
I can't sleep.

59:16.600 --> 59:19.100
And when I do... I have these dreams that are...

59:25.000 --> 59:27.000
And I can't stop
thinking about him.

59:28.100 --> 59:29.800
Tom... don't...

59:30.500 --> 59:32.000
Don't you ever think about him?

59:32.900 --> 59:34.500
Of course I think about him Tom.

59:34.800 --> 59:36.300
You say you don't sleep?

59:36.500 --> 59:37.900
You say you have nightmares?

59:38.000 --> 59:41.200
That girl who you say
is funny and charming and whitty...

59:41.800 --> 59:44.100
And has a great smile...
she doesn't smile anymore.

59:45.000 --> 59:46.100
I don't believe that.

59:46.400 --> 59:48.900
The only reason I can get up in the
morning and get out of the house

59:49.100 --> 59:50.800
Is because THIS is who I am now.

59:51.100 --> 59:52.600
- That's okay, honey.
- No, no.

59:53.000 --> 59:54.500
- No. - Maggie. - NO!

59:55.100 --> 59:56.400
Maggie wait.

01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:58.700
Brothers and sisters gather
close and prepare yourselves.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.900
The day of the resurrection is upon us.

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:05.800
The day we make history.
The day we launch the revolution!

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.700
We all know what we're looking for.

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:17.900
Remember... Do not fire
unless absolutely necessary.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.900
Biologicals here.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.500
Over there!

01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:43.600
- Cease fire! - Hands on your head. - Cease fire.

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.100
My God.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:22.800
I couldn't figure out why
the cops let Strickland off.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.300
So I started going
through the payroll records.

01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:27.900
You won't believe this.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:30.500
- For the last 16 months...
- He was working for us.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:31.800
That's right.

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:34.600
Which means Stones
gotta be dirty.

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.900
Looks like he hired Strickland to kill Canter.

01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.700
Hey Tom.
I thought you were on leave?

01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:48.300
Oh yeah... I am.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.300
Actually I was just suspended.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:54.200
Another investigation,
I'll just clear my desk out.

01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:55.800
You should be home.

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.600
Recuperating Ok?

01:02:57.900 --> 01:02:59.700
Not walking around here in the flesh...

01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.800
I was at home then I came
here to clean out my desk.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.600
And you know... before the
medication kicks in... Hopefully...

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:09.800
I can find a box...
And... Oh...

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:13.400
Victor Welsh wanted me to say hello.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.400
I'm sorry?

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.800
Victor Welsh, VSI, the good looking kid?

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.200
Very excited you coming over there, finally
moving into the private sector

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.500
You must be excited.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.300
Why don't you come into my
office, you're not looking too sharp.

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:27.600
Yeah Yeah... I got a minute.

01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.900
It's a good move for you.
It's a really good group over there.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:33.500
Smart.
Talented.

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:35.700
Great legal department.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.400
Great working environment.

01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:43.000
You gotta be happy with those
first year stock options huh?

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.900
What are you talkin' about?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.600
Myles Strickland, the guy I was chasing...

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.400
The guy you hired to kill Canter.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.300
- Tom you got it all wrong.
- You gave him the weapon.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:56.000
VSI makes them.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.600
They give one to you, you give it to
Strickland so he can go out and kill Canter.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:02.000
The only problem is, he
killed his son by mistake.

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:05.100
- Something is wrong with you.
- Why are you doing this?

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.200
Money? Is that what it is?

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.600
You need help.

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:09.600
This is Stone. That son of a
bitch Greer disabled my unit!

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:10.700
Stop him!

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.400
Go... Go!

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:30.300
Jesus. No wonder VSI
wants Canter dead.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:32.300
He's in bed with The Prophet.

01:05:32.900 --> 01:05:34.800
He's funding the
Anti-Surrogacy Movement.

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:36.500
He's given them names.

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:40.400
Crazy bastard invents surragotes and
does everything he can to destroy them.

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:44.400
It doesn't connect Stone to the murder.
We need to link him to the weapon.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.500
He needed codes to use it.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.800
I want you to look for access codes.

01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.700
You get the codes... You nail Stone.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.600
Good job Agent Greer.
Thank you.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.400
This is Agent Peters. I found Greer.

01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:10.000
He's been in an accident at
Market and Hanover.

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.100
- FBI!
- Get out of the car!

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.400
He's gone.

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.000
Scanning for identity chip.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:17.800
He doesn't have one, he's a meatbag!

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.500
There's and exit in the back!

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.800
Hey! Where you going?!
HEY!

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.300
Bobby it's Greer.
I need a remote shutdown.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.500
Agent Peters has been hijacked.

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:01.500
You gotta disconnect her.

01:09:02.300 --> 01:09:04.100
Bobby?
Hello Bobby?

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:05.700
Peters.

01:09:06.700 --> 01:09:07.899
Have you gone insane?

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:11.300
Why don't you put the gun down? huh?
What are you trying to prove?

01:09:12.100 --> 01:09:14.600
She's grabbing into the entire 3rd network!

01:09:26.700 --> 01:09:29.100
Maggie get offline right away, as
soon as you get this message.

01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:31.700
Something is going to
happen to the surrogates.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.200
- She'll only speak to you sir. - Why don't
you just move in and take her down huh?

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.300
She has a human hostage.

01:09:39.899 --> 01:09:41.399
Uh... the slob Saunders...

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:53.500
Peters?

01:10:00.600 --> 01:10:02.500
Peters it's me Andy Stone.

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:04.800
That's far enough Stone.

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.200
I know who hired you to kill me.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.300
I hope my old partners
at VSI paid you well.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:21.200
Did you feel even a second of remorse when
you found out you murdered an innocent boy?

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:23.400
Canter?

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.200
I don't believe it.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:31.000
Ok... How about you tell me something Doctor.
Huh?

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.800
What did you expect VSI to do?

01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:37.100
Just stand by while you tore
down everything they built?

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:39.600
You left us no choice
but to take you out.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.700
You created the technology, you changed
the world and now want to destroy it?

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:45.600
So what?

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:48.000
So you can take us backwards?

01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.900
So we can all live like Dreads?

01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:56.600
So we can live like
human beings.

01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.100
Really Doctor?

01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.300
You should learn
how to live with your regrets.

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:06.700
Now give me the gun.

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.600
That's for my son.

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.600
I need to see your boss.

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:52.500
I need to see Dr. Canter right away!

01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:55.100
Oh good... Listen to me... I
gotta to see your boss. Dr. Canter he...

01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.100

01:12:14.300 --> 01:12:16.100

<i>Warning! Commencing Upload.</i>

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.600
Hello Tom.

01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.100
Nice to finally meet you.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.000
In the flesh.

01:14:36.300 --> 01:14:39.200
Now... Lie on the floor, face down.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.600
It's a little different when you have
to kill somebody with your own hands.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.700
You're going to have to squeeze the trigger.
You don't have a machine to do your dirty work.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.100
Feel that?

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.600
An accelerated pulse, the
heightened awareness...

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.400
Savouring each breath
as if it were your last.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.200
That what you've been missing.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.400
That's what everbodys been missing.

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:07.000
- So you kill millions of people?
- I changed the course of human
history when I invented surrogates.

01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:10.300
Now I'm going to change it back.

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:12.600
You can't change what's been done.

01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:16.000
You and I know that
better than most people.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.900
My son's death will not
have been in vain.

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:23.100
Not if it heals mankind.

01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:25.300
Heals mankind?

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:28.700
That what you want to do?
You want to kill everyone?

01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:31.800
- And that's going to heal mankind?
- They're already dead.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.200
They died the minute they
plugged into those machines.

01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:35.600
This is not the solution.

01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:37.900
- That's the way it is.
- That's not the way it is!

01:15:38.100 --> 01:15:41.000
I had a vision. I was going
to empower the powerless.

01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:44.300
To enable other like me to walk, to feel.

01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:49.100
- To live a normal life.
- Listen to me! They're going to call you
a murderer! That is what you're doing!

01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:51.000
Surrogacy is a perversion.

01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:52.600
It's an addiction.

01:15:52.800 --> 01:15:55.700

addict to kill the addiction.
