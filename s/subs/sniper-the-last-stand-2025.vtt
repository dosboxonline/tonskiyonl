00:33.117 --> 00:34.743
[ON RADIO] <i>Phoenix
Squad, this is Overwatch.</i>

00:34.744 --> 00:35.828
<i>Say again?</i>

00:39.290 --> 00:40.916
<i>Overwatch,
this is Phoenix.</i>

00:42.585 --> 00:44.503
<i>Phoenix squad in his tunnel.</i>

00:46.130 --> 00:47.548
<i>Bypass tunnel up next.</i>

00:48.299 --> 00:49.508
<i>Requesting sitrep.</i>

00:51.677 --> 00:53.053
<i>Overwatch in position.</i>

00:53.763 --> 00:54.847
<i>Eyes on four guards.</i>

00:56.182 --> 00:57.390
<i>Two on Gate Wall.</i>

00:57.391 --> 00:58.642
<i>Two on the ground up front.</i>

00:59.894 --> 01:02.480
<i>Watchtower empty.
Compound is quiet.</i>

01:05.649 --> 01:07.985
<i>Copy.
Overwatch, hold position.</i>

01:19.997 --> 01:22.374
When the call comes,
who goes first?

01:25.961 --> 01:26.962
Rooftop Guards.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.964
The ones on the ground
won't see them go down.

01:29.965 --> 01:31.175
What's the order of shots?

01:31.801 --> 01:34.177
Pudgy guard on the left first.

01:34.178 --> 01:35.512
Why?

01:35.513 --> 01:37.138
He's closer to the door.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.140
Which means closer to the alarm.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.644
Gives me time to hit both
before they can reach it.

01:43.312 --> 01:45.063
<i>Overwatch, this is Phoenix.</i>

01:45.064 --> 01:46.898
Initial contact made.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.483
One hostile down.

01:48.484 --> 01:50.861
ETA, one minute to junction box.

02:41.996 --> 02:42.997
Looping cameras.

02:44.331 --> 02:46.041
Looks like Primary Target
is in the office.

02:46.959 --> 02:49.378
Copy. Office. Moving up and out.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.386
<i>Overwatch, this is Phoenix.</i>

02:58.387 --> 02:59.888
Go for Overwatch.

02:59.889 --> 03:01.556
<i>Phoenix Squad
out of the tunnel.</i>

03:01.557 --> 03:04.058
<i>Green light. You're cleared hot.</i>

03:04.059 --> 03:06.519
<i>Engage targets. Clear the way.</i>

03:06.520 --> 03:08.479
Copy, Phoenix. Going hot.

03:08.480 --> 03:09.940
Here we go.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.070
First target.

03:16.280 --> 03:17.364
Execute.

03:24.288 --> 03:26.206
Zondi? Send it.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.966
Impact center, tall man.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.263
Impact center.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.932
Zondi, breathe.

03:43.933 --> 03:45.184
Stay focused.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.187
In control. No emotion.

03:52.358 --> 03:54.526
You take the left.
I'll take far right target.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.655
- Ready.
-Fire.

04:03.953 --> 04:05.453
You missed.

04:05.454 --> 04:06.829
Wait for it.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.457
No!

04:12.711 --> 04:14.087
<i>Phoenix, this is Overwatch.</i>

04:14.088 --> 04:16.714
<i>Targets down.
Clear to enter compound.</i>

04:16.715 --> 04:18.257
<i>Copy, Overwatch.</i>

04:18.258 --> 04:20.551
<i>Hold position. All teams go.</i>

04:20.552 --> 04:23.096
<i>Do not allow them
to sound the alarm.</i>

04:55.587 --> 04:58.756
- Charlie Team. Garage is clear.
-<i>Copy.</i>

04:58.757 --> 05:02.261
<i>Alpha team heading to the office
in search of primary target.</i>

05:16.150 --> 05:17.442
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

05:25.325 --> 05:26.409
Sorry I didn't check.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.996
Shake it off. Let's keep moving.
Clock's ticking.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.898
Delta Team.
Munitions Room clear.

05:56.899 --> 05:59.692
<i>Copy.
Delta, hold position.</i>

06:14.166 --> 06:15.374
Shit.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.001
<i>Alpha team
in pursuit of hostile.</i>

06:17.002 --> 06:18.461
<i>On route to primary target.</i>

06:57.918 --> 07:00.629
Alpha team engaged.
Hold positions.

07:05.467 --> 07:07.176
This is Kovalov.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.680
<i>We have trespassers
in my house.</i>

07:10.264 --> 07:12.891
Show them
what we do with intruders.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.020
<i>Overwatch. Alarm triggered.</i>

07:18.021 --> 07:19.481
<i>Be on high alert.</i>

07:21.358 --> 07:23.986
The weapon. Take me to it.

07:26.989 --> 07:28.739
<i>Alpha team
pursuing primary target.</i>

07:28.740 --> 07:31.075
It's not ready.
It hasn't been tested.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.884
Eyes on. Tell me what you see.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.976
Watchtower,
sniper and spotter.

07:59.771 --> 08:00.772
Contact.

08:12.576 --> 08:15.453
Bravo, Kovalov and Maxim
are between us!

08:15.454 --> 08:16.538
<i>Box them in.</i>

08:17.831 --> 08:19.415
We can't just
sit on the sidelines.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.876
Hold position.

08:26.131 --> 08:28.133
You hold.
I'm going to get in the game.

08:29.718 --> 08:30.802
Hilo!

08:33.263 --> 08:34.264
Hilo!

08:35.974 --> 08:37.225
Damn it!

08:37.226 --> 08:40.729
Modise! Is that really you?

08:41.313 --> 08:42.647
This is your last chance,

08:42.648 --> 08:44.398
Ryker Kovalov.

08:44.399 --> 08:47.318
- There's no way out this time.
- You're the one without an exit.

08:47.319 --> 08:50.655
If I don't kill you,
Prime Minister Diaz will.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.949
You'll never
get out of Costa Verde alive.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.910
You came all this way
for nothing.

08:57.788 --> 08:58.872
Tangos coming in!

09:00.707 --> 09:03.502
Alpha falling back!
Bravo clear to engage.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.803
They're close.
The lab is above us.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.014
What do we do?

09:17.307 --> 09:20.518
Modise said hold, so we hold.

09:26.650 --> 09:30.153
Distance, 928. Wind, 6.8.

09:30.612 --> 09:31.613
928.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.074
Wind, 6.8.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.200
What's the math?

09:36.201 --> 09:38.245
13 degrees descending.
No adjustment.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.871
You take the spotter.

09:40.872 --> 09:41.957
I got the sniper.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.585
On my signal. Send it.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.010
This is Kovalov.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.720
We had a deal, Prime Minister.

09:57.055 --> 10:00.141
Send your militia!
Send everyone.

10:00.142 --> 10:02.227
Do you hear me? Everyone!

10:06.440 --> 10:07.441
Is this it?

10:08.942 --> 10:10.484
- Grim Reaper?
- Yes.

10:10.485 --> 10:11.902
But as I said, it...

10:11.903 --> 10:13.237
Will it work?

10:14.197 --> 10:15.156
Will it work?

10:15.157 --> 10:16.908
Theoretically, yes, but...

10:17.492 --> 10:18.951
it hasn't...

10:18.952 --> 10:22.204
Wait. Wait. The weapon
is currently omnidirectional.

10:22.205 --> 10:26.209
I need to focus its trajectory
or we're all in danger!

10:34.509 --> 10:35.510
How long?

10:36.762 --> 10:39.056
- How long?
- Give me a second!

10:40.223 --> 10:41.766
Hilo in position, on your six.

10:41.767 --> 10:44.269
Bravo, fall back!
Alpha engaging!

10:54.488 --> 10:55.905
Time's up, Maxim.

10:55.906 --> 10:57.824
Hands up! Let's see 'em!

10:58.408 --> 10:59.409
Go, go, go.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.382
- It's over, Kovalov.
-You're right, Modise.

11:14.383 --> 11:17.803
It is over, for you.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.513
Wait, no!

12:22.200 --> 12:24.703
Master Gunnery Sergeant
Brandon Beckett.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.750
Not in
the US Marine Corps anymore.

12:31.168 --> 12:32.293
Just Brandon Beckett.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.420
Save the modesty.
You're the Brandon Beckett.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.505
Best shot in the world.

12:36.715 --> 12:38.425
I've been known
to hit a target or two.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.844
Commander Bongani Modise.

12:41.470 --> 12:42.512
Good to meet you, sir.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.974
Apologies, but I'll need
a briefing on the op

12:46.641 --> 12:49.643
along with whatever country
we're standing in.

12:49.644 --> 12:52.438
I've been on six planes
in the past 36 hours.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.607
Passed through airports
with no customs, so,

12:54.608 --> 12:58.027
I can only assume that whatever
country we're standing in

12:58.028 --> 12:59.195
does not know I'm here.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.447
Walk with me, Beckett.

13:01.698 --> 13:03.073
So, without knowing the mission,

13:03.074 --> 13:05.118
you got on a plane
at short notice.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.622
Colonel Gabriel Stone
deployed me to assist you.

13:09.623 --> 13:10.998
What he says goes.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.626
I'm just
a Marine following orders.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.753
Ah, Gabriel and I go way back.

13:15.754 --> 13:19.632
Now he leads the CIA's
most lethal Black Ops team.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.801
That's right. He's the boss.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.054
But I was sent
because officially,

13:25.055 --> 13:26.931
the CIA can't be involved.

13:26.932 --> 13:29.100
Not on this one.
Believe me, I know.

13:35.899 --> 13:36.983
Brandon Beckett,

13:37.984 --> 13:38.985
Nadia Abrams

13:40.445 --> 13:41.654
and Casanova Diaz.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.156
Welcome to Costa Verde.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.200
Diaz...

13:47.244 --> 13:48.245
Costa Verde...

13:48.954 --> 13:50.120
Bruno Diaz was my father.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.748
And I know
you were framed for his death.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.585
Yeah. Sorry for your loss.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.004
Nova was 100%
behind you joining the mission,

13:59.005 --> 14:01.675
but your endorsement came from
another very trusted source.

14:02.926 --> 14:04.135
All right, let's get going.

14:10.725 --> 14:11.767
My father was killed

14:11.768 --> 14:13.853
for the good he was doing
in this country.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.814
Then my uncle, Roman Diaz,

14:16.815 --> 14:19.275
took advantage of the pain
and anger of the people

14:19.276 --> 14:21.111
and used it to rise to power.

14:22.612 --> 14:25.573
Then he sold my country
to the highest bidders,

14:25.574 --> 14:29.159
to people like Ryker Kovalov,
"The Death Broker."

14:29.160 --> 14:30.494
Kovalov has a deal with

14:30.495 --> 14:32.037
the Prime Minister
of Costa Verde.

14:32.038 --> 14:35.457
He is allowed to make and sell
weapons without interference,

14:35.458 --> 14:37.585
as long as he provides arms

14:37.586 --> 14:39.545
to the Prime Minister's
personal army.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.214
I belong to a group
that is fighting back,

14:42.215 --> 14:43.799
the Phoenix Rebellion.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.760
Bringing Kovalov to justice
is what Costa Verde needs

14:46.761 --> 14:49.722
in order to demonstrate
that we can rise from the ashes

14:49.723 --> 14:51.432
and reclaim what is ours.

14:51.433 --> 14:54.059
When Nova discovered
Kovalov's headquarters,

14:54.060 --> 14:56.520
I parked a satellite overhead.

14:56.521 --> 14:59.440
Kovalov only checks in
once a quarter to pick up

14:59.441 --> 15:01.609
Maxim's latest weapon,
but two nights ago,

15:01.610 --> 15:04.778
we picked up the heat signature
of a UH-60 chopper

15:04.779 --> 15:06.155
touching down
in the compound courtyard.

15:07.616 --> 15:09.492
So, we're hitting
their base of operations.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.160
Timetable?

15:11.161 --> 15:12.745
Forty-eight hours.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.080
It's gonna be tight.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.082
I need time to do recon.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.292
Topography checks,
drone analysis.

15:18.293 --> 15:19.501
Already done.

15:19.502 --> 15:22.004
You just need to do
what you do best.

15:22.005 --> 15:23.131
Pull the trigger.

15:53.787 --> 15:54.871
Sir,

15:55.789 --> 15:57.665
the trusted source
who recommended me

15:57.666 --> 15:58.750
for this assignment?

15:59.709 --> 16:01.086
That was my old man, right?

16:01.878 --> 16:04.546
Yeah, I know about your father.
He's a legend.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.965
But no, I've never met him.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.218
It was our mutual friend, Rozie.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.721
Rozie? Who the hell is that?

16:12.555 --> 16:13.973
"Thunderstorm's coming..."

16:16.434 --> 16:17.686
"Time to grab my boots..."

16:18.186 --> 16:20.062
"And go dance in the rain."

16:20.063 --> 16:21.397
Ezekiel Rosenberg.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.274
I didn't expect
to find you in this place.

16:26.695 --> 16:27.987
This is where you've been
the past month.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.198
Vanish on me
without saying goodbye.

16:30.740 --> 16:32.784
Yeah, had to keep this one
close to the vest.

16:33.535 --> 16:34.702
Modise called with

16:34.703 --> 16:35.786
an opportunity
I couldn't pass up.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.830
Since he arrived here,
Rozie's been telling me

16:37.831 --> 16:39.623
how I couldn't pull this off
without you.

16:39.624 --> 16:40.708
And as you know...

16:40.709 --> 16:42.918
What, that he can be
a persistent pain in the ass?

16:42.919 --> 16:44.128
Oh, I know.

16:44.129 --> 16:46.380
Well, then he can be
your tour guide.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.843
Rozie, show Beckett around.
I'll see you guys inside.

16:50.385 --> 16:51.428
Yes, sir.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.558
- "Rozie"?
- Okay.

16:57.559 --> 16:59.978
Only Modise gets
to call me that. Come on.

17:02.188 --> 17:03.940
Had to keep this one
close to the vest, huh?

17:04.733 --> 17:05.733
Why's that?

17:05.734 --> 17:08.403
It's the one that got away, B.
It's my white whale.

17:09.446 --> 17:10.904
Ryker Kovalov.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.365
Modise has been
after him for years,

17:13.366 --> 17:16.286
chasing explosions across Africa
all the way to America.

17:16.828 --> 17:17.828
That when you met him?

17:17.829 --> 17:19.872
Mm-hmm.
I was with Homeland at the time,

17:19.873 --> 17:22.041
but there was an entire
global network after this guy.

17:22.667 --> 17:25.002
Once Kovalov
crossed into the US,

17:25.003 --> 17:26.963
Modise thought
we could take him out together.

17:27.797 --> 17:28.798
Then what?

17:30.425 --> 17:32.092
Kovalov was able
to operate within the US

17:32.093 --> 17:34.052
because I was stuck filling out
paperwork and going

17:34.053 --> 17:35.804
- through proper channels.
-  Yeah.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.014
By the time
we got the green light,

17:37.015 --> 17:38.099
he was gone.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.101
You never told me
about this before.

17:40.852 --> 17:42.353
Twice I could've
stopped this guy, B.

17:43.104 --> 17:44.105
I should've stopped him.

17:45.523 --> 17:46.524
But I missed.

17:48.151 --> 17:49.234
It happens, man.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.111
I've never seen you miss.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.197
I've missed plenty.

17:52.822 --> 17:56.575
I just try to figure out why,
reload, fire again.

17:58.244 --> 17:59.537
Come on, let me show you around.

18:03.583 --> 18:04.875
Why now?

18:04.876 --> 18:07.170
What makes Kovalov
more vulnerable than before?

18:07.670 --> 18:09.463
About a month ago,
Nova discovered

18:09.464 --> 18:12.216
Kovalov's personal, in-house
weapons designer,

18:12.217 --> 18:15.720
Mauser Maxim,
operating here in Costa Verde.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.223
And what can
you tell me about Nova?

18:18.765 --> 18:19.765
He's a tech genius.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.517
Basically, the Intel Pete
of Costa Verde.

18:21.518 --> 18:23.852
Just, you know, less snarky.

18:23.853 --> 18:25.687
He was able to trace
dark web payments

18:25.688 --> 18:28.440
from the Prime Minister's
shell corporations to Kovalov.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.903
He then followed the money
to Kovalov and Maxim's compound.

18:32.487 --> 18:35.531
And Nova reached out to Modise,
who put together the op.

18:35.532 --> 18:36.782
Exactly.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.283
Nova knew he had the resources

18:38.284 --> 18:39.827
to pull this off
under the radar.

18:39.828 --> 18:41.245
Hey, team.

18:41.246 --> 18:44.207
Modise is a damn patriot.
You're gonna love him.

18:48.211 --> 18:50.879
Modise is so highly regarded
in the SSA,

18:50.880 --> 18:53.174
he's able
to pick his own assignments.

18:55.260 --> 18:57.427
And this is our squad.

18:57.428 --> 19:00.264
Code name, <i>Efile Noma Ephila.</i>

19:00.265 --> 19:01.349
Dead or Alive.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.810
We take our enemies
dead or alive.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.812
The mission is completed
whether we live or die.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.897
Modise handpicked 10 individuals

19:08.898 --> 19:10.440
from agencies
all over the world.

19:10.441 --> 19:14.570
This is Anele.
But you can call her Angel.

19:14.571 --> 19:15.737
Don't be fooled
by her name, though.

19:15.738 --> 19:16.822
She fights without fear.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.532
She was Modise's
first pick for the team,

19:18.533 --> 19:20.450
and she is
his second-in-command.

19:20.451 --> 19:21.536
This is Hera.

19:22.662 --> 19:23.913
This is Hilo.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.082
<i>Jumeaux Hache.</i> The Axe Twins.

19:27.083 --> 19:29.543
Now you've already
met Nadia and Nova.

19:29.544 --> 19:30.879
You'll meet
the rest of the team later.

19:32.005 --> 19:33.380
I've been here
training with these guys

19:33.381 --> 19:35.716
ever since the Colonel
loaned me out a month ago.

19:35.717 --> 19:37.676
We had to
all come in here piecemeal,

19:37.677 --> 19:40.304
one at a time,
in order to avoid suspicion.

19:40.305 --> 19:43.266
And you, my friend,
you're our final piece.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.226
Ladies and gentlemen,

19:45.894 --> 19:49.021
this is the Brandon Beckett.

19:52.775 --> 19:55.028
The 2017 Fusco job in Yemen.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.196
Did you really do that solo?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.657
The hell are you
talking about, huh?

20:00.241 --> 20:01.617
That was a six-man op.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.243
I'm telling you,
it's what I heard.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.913
Don't forget the Tangiers
2.4k shot before then.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.999
2.4 kilometers?

20:09.042 --> 20:10.835
Impossible. No?

20:12.086 --> 20:13.921
How many confirmed kills
do you have, huh?

20:13.922 --> 20:15.006
What's the count?

20:15.590 --> 20:18.884
I just count the number
of assignments I complete,

20:18.885 --> 20:20.595
not the number of bullets
it takes to complete them.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.931
And that's
the exact kind of attitude

20:23.932 --> 20:25.099
we want from our mentor.

20:26.976 --> 20:29.979
This is Thabo Zondi, our sniper.

20:30.688 --> 20:31.897
Zondi was a hard hand

20:31.898 --> 20:33.690
in the South African
National Defense Force.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.901
He never missed during training.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.864
But with limited assignment,
he's, uh, still green.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.284
- How green?
- Huh?

20:44.452 --> 20:45.453
Kill count, zero.

20:46.704 --> 20:47.871
Which is where you come in.

20:49.874 --> 20:52.000
With all due respect, sir,
I am no tutor.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.335
And I don't need one,

20:53.336 --> 20:55.463
but I am interested
in proving myself.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.506
That right?

20:57.507 --> 20:59.633
I've got what it takes.
Let me show you what I can do.

20:59.634 --> 21:01.970
It doesn't matter.
That is the assignment.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.014
Enough of this meet and greet.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.099
We have shit to do.

21:07.100 --> 21:09.394
<i>The more you sweat in training,</i>

21:10.186 --> 21:11.937
<i>the less you bleed in battle.</i>

21:19.654 --> 21:20.654
<i>Thermals tell us</i>

21:20.655 --> 21:24.157
<i>there are 20 to 25 warm bodies
on the ground.</i>

21:24.158 --> 21:26.785
Expect them to be
packing heavy artillery.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.371
We'll catch them early morning
when they are tired

21:29.372 --> 21:30.748
and starting to decompress.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.876
<i>The compound
has an escape tunnel.</i>

21:34.877 --> 21:36.962
<i>Their exit will be our entrance.</i>

21:36.963 --> 21:39.298
<i>We will use it to access
the compound undetected.</i>

21:40.383 --> 21:41.466
<i>It will drop us into a cellar</i>

21:41.467 --> 21:43.677
<i>where Kovalov
keeps the hatch hidden.</i>

21:43.678 --> 21:45.096
Nicely done.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.765
Now run it again.
Only this time,

21:49.851 --> 21:51.227
grab your NV. Go!

21:58.609 --> 22:01.445
Kovalov's mad scientist,
Mauser Maxim,

22:01.446 --> 22:03.780
is a weapon's designer,
so we need to be prepared

22:03.781 --> 22:05.782
for whatever
they might throw at us.

22:05.783 --> 22:09.661
Pack your gas masks,
Cipro, Doxy, Levo

22:09.662 --> 22:12.456
in case of exposure
to Anthrax or nerve gas.

22:12.457 --> 22:14.666
Once the Primary Target
is acquired,

22:14.667 --> 22:17.127
we will seize whatever
weapons and intel we can

22:17.128 --> 22:19.254
and double time it
back to the tunnel.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.173
We will then head
to a private dock

22:21.174 --> 22:23.633
where a fishing vessel
will be waiting.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.594
And we'll remain below deck

22:25.595 --> 22:27.888
until it reaches
international waters,

22:27.889 --> 22:30.474
where I have people standing by
to receive us.

22:30.475 --> 22:33.852
The Primary
and Secondary Targets,

22:33.853 --> 22:34.936
dead or alive?

22:34.937 --> 22:38.982
Kovalov and Maxim are
more valuable alive than dead.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.150
That being said,

22:40.151 --> 22:43.820
if they draw down on you,
you're cleared to neutralize.

22:43.821 --> 22:47.115
In honor of our connection
with the Phoenix Rebellion,

22:47.116 --> 22:50.327
on this assignment,
we are Phoenix Squad.

22:50.328 --> 22:52.454
And there will be five teams
within the Squad.

22:52.455 --> 22:55.499
Alpha Team, Nadia and Sello.

22:55.500 --> 22:56.584
You're with me.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.463
<i>We'll be hunting
the Primary Target, Kovalov.</i>

23:01.339 --> 23:04.467
<i>Rozie will lead Jansen and Jedd
on Bravo Team.</i>

23:05.218 --> 23:07.552
<i>Find and secure
the research laboratory.</i>

23:07.553 --> 23:08.720
<i>Make sure none of</i>

23:08.721 --> 23:11.848
Maxim's god-forsaken
inventions of death go off.

23:11.849 --> 23:15.310
Hera and Hilo,
you are Charlie Team.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.938
<i>Secure the garage.</i>

23:18.564 --> 23:20.941
<i>Dismantle any vehicles you find.</i>

23:20.942 --> 23:22.484
Make sure no one can get away.

23:22.485 --> 23:25.696
Don't worry, they won't
get past the <i>Jumeaux Hache.</i>

23:26.280 --> 23:28.574
Nova, you're with me
on Delta Team.

23:29.283 --> 23:30.992
<i>We will secure Munitions Room</i>

23:30.993 --> 23:32.745
<i>until it is safe
for you to mine data.</i>

23:44.173 --> 23:46.801
Nova, hit dirt. You're dead.

23:50.763 --> 23:52.807
<i>We need to keep
a low profile on this, people.</i>

23:53.558 --> 23:56.017
Kovalov is protected
by Prime Minister Diaz,

23:56.018 --> 23:58.895
who has a sizable militia
he uses to do his dirty work.

23:58.896 --> 24:01.022
If word gets out
on this raid,

24:01.023 --> 24:05.069
the 20 guards become
a hundred armed militia.

24:05.903 --> 24:08.321
Why aren't the Phoenix Rebellion
going in with us?

24:08.322 --> 24:09.531
Because if we fail,

24:09.532 --> 24:12.075
they're the last hope
to turn this country around.

24:12.076 --> 24:13.285
He's right.

24:13.286 --> 24:15.871
Calling them in
is the last of all last resorts.

24:15.872 --> 24:18.039
Now the final team on our squad,

24:18.040 --> 24:20.585
keeping an eye
on all of us from above...

24:21.752 --> 24:22.753
Overwatch.

24:24.297 --> 24:26.924
Zondi and Beckett.

25:08.216 --> 25:09.217
Nicely done.

25:14.889 --> 25:15.973
Between you and I,

25:17.475 --> 25:18.851
how many confirmed kills
do you have?

25:20.895 --> 25:22.438
That first kill
is the only one that matters.

25:23.231 --> 25:24.607
That's the toughest.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.651
The first time I had to kill,

25:27.652 --> 25:29.362
I wasn't sure if I was
going to be able to do it.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.030
You get all these questions

25:32.031 --> 25:33.366
that start
running through your mind.

25:34.992 --> 25:38.037
Am I clear to kill this man?
Is it justified?

25:41.666 --> 25:43.376
But you don't have time
to answer these questions.

25:44.669 --> 25:46.087
The target answers them for you.

25:46.921 --> 25:50.091
Because if you don't
pull that trigger, he will.

25:50.675 --> 25:52.635
And he will kill you
or one of your squad.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.890
And you may be taking a life,
but you are saving another one.

25:59.809 --> 26:01.060
So, you pull that trigger.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.235
Good work today.

26:10.236 --> 26:11.570
Let's grab some chow.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.573
I'm telling you,
mine is much worse.

26:15.574 --> 26:16.908
You gotta trust me on that.

26:16.909 --> 26:17.909
<i>Tu es fou!</i>

26:17.910 --> 26:21.204
Listen, if my bullet was just
one centimeter to the left...

26:21.205 --> 26:22.289
That's ridiculous!

26:22.290 --> 26:23.999
...I would be
a very different man.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.834
Sorry, brother,
getting a toe shot off

26:25.835 --> 26:27.419
is way worse
than a bullet to the thigh.

26:27.420 --> 26:28.586
- Thank you!
- Way worse!

26:28.587 --> 26:30.714
Thank you! Thank you! Yes!

26:30.715 --> 26:32.507
-It's a pinky toe.
-Hey, hey, hey.

26:32.508 --> 26:34.217
A pinky toe helps
to stabilize balance.

26:34.218 --> 26:35.927
- He's got a point.
- Yes! Thank you, brother.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.096
- Yeah, yes!
-Whoa! Whoa!

26:37.930 --> 26:40.056
Neither of you
compares to Angel.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.100
Wow, what is it?
Two missing pinky toe?

26:44.353 --> 26:45.437
What are they talking about?

26:45.438 --> 26:47.731
-Let's hear it.
-Tell it!

26:47.732 --> 26:49.775
Angel would tell
the story better,

26:50.443 --> 26:52.027
but I know she will not.

26:52.028 --> 26:54.779
I, on the other hand,
would be delighted to.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.406
-Yes!
-We want to hear it!

26:56.407 --> 26:57.407
Yes! Let's go!

26:57.408 --> 26:58.950
- Come on.
-We want to know.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.202
So, a few years ago,

27:01.203 --> 27:05.666
this man Moses Mogale
set a petrol station on fire.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.084
He wanted
to blow the whole thing up

27:08.085 --> 27:09.712
and take a crowd with him.

27:10.463 --> 27:13.882
Angel, who was SAPS at the time,

27:13.883 --> 27:16.259
uh, the street level police,

27:16.260 --> 27:20.639
she took one look at this madman
walking through a sea of fire.

27:21.390 --> 27:22.892
And she jumped in.

27:24.685 --> 27:27.438
And the man
was armed to the teeth.

27:28.022 --> 27:31.442
And he repeatedly
stabbed Angel with a knife.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.610
- Did that stop her?
-No!

27:33.611 --> 27:36.614
She fought with this man
until eventually,

27:37.239 --> 27:39.033
surrounded by an inferno

27:39.617 --> 27:42.160
with 11 stab wounds,

27:42.161 --> 27:45.038
Angel knocked this man out.

27:45.039 --> 27:46.791
Unconscious.

27:48.417 --> 27:49.376
Wow!

27:49.377 --> 27:50.835
- Whoo!
-Damn.

27:50.836 --> 27:52.170
Where did he stab you?

27:52.171 --> 27:53.338
Come on, show us.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.173
- Yeah. We wanna see.
-Let's see it. Prove it.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.508
Show us!

27:56.509 --> 27:58.593
Come on.

27:58.594 --> 28:00.053
Let's see it now.

28:00.054 --> 28:01.638
-Come on.
-Show us. Show us.

28:01.639 --> 28:03.766
Okay, okay, relax. Relax.

28:11.148 --> 28:13.149
Oh, shit!

28:13.150 --> 28:14.818
- Holy shit.
- Okay.

28:14.819 --> 28:16.653
The champion.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.614
- Damn.
-That's for real.

28:19.615 --> 28:22.283
- Wow.
- Okay, put it down.

28:22.284 --> 28:25.328
The moment
I saw the story in the news,

28:25.329 --> 28:27.414
I knew
I had to meet this warrior.

28:31.001 --> 28:33.211
So, how's that, uh,
missing pinky toe looking?

28:33.212 --> 28:34.587
Oh, come on.
That's not fair.

28:35.506 --> 28:37.174
What happened?
Did it go to market?

28:41.554 --> 28:42.554
I gotta ask,

28:42.555 --> 28:44.931
if you two
aren't siblings, then, uh...

28:44.932 --> 28:47.268
Where did, uh, <i>Jumeaux Hache</i>
come from?

28:47.726 --> 28:49.060
Everyone asks.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.854
I was, uh, French Armed Forces.

28:50.855 --> 28:52.230
I was Canadian Armed Forces.

28:52.231 --> 28:53.898
Posted to
a UN peacekeeping mission

28:53.899 --> 28:55.733
along the Lebanon border.

28:55.734 --> 28:58.153
I was part of Operation Ultra,

28:58.154 --> 28:59.989
Canada's division
of the UN mission.

29:00.698 --> 29:03.783
One day, both our units
are assigned a routine patrol.

29:03.784 --> 29:05.452
When a suicide
car bomber exploded

29:05.453 --> 29:06.953
near our armored
personnel carrier.

29:06.954 --> 29:09.248
-Killing everyone.
- Except us. We went for cover.

29:09.915 --> 29:12.292
- We got trapped.
- Inside a decaying building.

29:12.293 --> 29:15.003
With dozens of
Al-Qaeda-inspired militants

29:15.004 --> 29:16.087
chasing after, eh.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.839
Once we ran out of bullets,

29:17.840 --> 29:19.675
all we had left
were our tactical hawks.

29:22.303 --> 29:25.848
We had to, uh, cut our way
out of the situation.

29:27.308 --> 29:29.268
Once you've been through
something like that together...

29:29.852 --> 29:30.936
You become family.

29:32.771 --> 29:33.772
The Axe Twins.

29:39.904 --> 29:44.700
So, uh, your secret
CIA Division, it has merch?

29:45.993 --> 29:47.827
What, you got a gift shop?

29:47.828 --> 29:49.121
They're for members only.

30:00.341 --> 30:01.675
I've been hunting before,
you know.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.261
I'm sure.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.347
But I need to see
that you can take a life.

30:07.348 --> 30:08.432
No matter the size.

30:09.475 --> 30:14.145
My uncle used to take me,
after my father was KIA.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.105
Mm.

30:16.815 --> 30:17.815
You said you come

30:17.816 --> 30:19.360
from a family line
of freedom fighters?

30:20.277 --> 30:23.863
My grandfather was a part
of <i>Umkhonto we Sizwe,</i>

30:23.864 --> 30:26.825
the paramilitary wing
of the ANC, under Mandela.

30:27.952 --> 30:29.286
He was killed in '86.

30:30.788 --> 30:34.123
My father enlisted
into the SANDF

30:34.124 --> 30:35.584
as soon as he was able.

30:36.919 --> 30:40.214
He died in combat,
under Modise's command.

30:42.132 --> 30:43.509
I'm sorry to hear that.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.636
When I enlisted,

30:46.637 --> 30:48.264
there were many who knew my name

30:49.014 --> 30:50.933
because of my father
and grandfather.

30:52.184 --> 30:53.978
They died fighting
for their country.

30:55.104 --> 30:56.313
There's no greater death.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.109
I hope to go out
the same way, too,

31:01.235 --> 31:03.237
and add to their legacy
as patriots.

31:45.362 --> 31:46.780
What are you working on?

31:58.667 --> 31:59.668
It's nice.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.213
It's for my daughter.

32:05.049 --> 32:06.925
From the fairy tale,
<i>The One-Eyed Monster.</i>

32:08.969 --> 32:10.763
You ever heard of it?

32:12.931 --> 32:13.932
Can't say that I have.

32:28.447 --> 32:30.199
When's the last time
you saw your daughter?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.121
It's too long.

32:57.935 --> 32:58.936
Damn it.

33:02.731 --> 33:04.108
The music help you concentrate?

33:05.109 --> 33:08.194
I'm sure sound is extremely
important in the field, but...

33:08.195 --> 33:10.738
I work much better
when all I hear is my music.

33:10.739 --> 33:12.700
It drowns out
the noise of the world.

33:16.078 --> 33:17.329
What's your music of choice?

33:18.038 --> 33:19.039
Remixes.

33:19.957 --> 33:21.959
Something like classical
meets EDM.

33:23.460 --> 33:24.460
Hell of a combo.

33:24.461 --> 33:26.588
I know.

33:27.464 --> 33:28.798
My mom got me into music,

33:28.799 --> 33:32.051
so I guess I have to thank her
for my eclectic taste.

33:32.052 --> 33:34.637
She got me piano lessons, but,

33:34.638 --> 33:37.266
I insisted in playing
a different keyboard.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.183
Learned to code,

33:39.184 --> 33:41.520
started writing it,
then started hacking it.

33:42.104 --> 33:43.439
Became a digital soldier.

33:46.275 --> 33:48.819
I would like to think that she
was still very proud of me.

33:49.820 --> 33:51.071
Nova...

33:51.530 --> 33:53.406
the prime minister, your uncle?

33:53.407 --> 33:54.533
Yeah?

33:55.075 --> 33:56.910
He's gonna see this as treason.

33:58.871 --> 34:01.832
If you stay,
your freedom, your life,

34:02.708 --> 34:04.125
it's gonna be in jeopardy.

34:04.126 --> 34:05.711
This is my destiny.

34:06.628 --> 34:09.548
Using my skills to continue
the work my dad started.

34:10.632 --> 34:12.342
Ridding Costa Verde
of corruption.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.845
For myself, for my siblings,

34:15.846 --> 34:18.557
for the people of Costa Verde,
for my father.

34:20.768 --> 34:22.226
If that's treason,

34:22.227 --> 34:24.813
then it's a price
I'm willing to pay.

34:33.614 --> 34:34.948
<i>Efile Noma Ephila.</i>

34:36.241 --> 34:37.743
Ladies and gentlemen,

34:38.619 --> 34:39.787
soldiers...

34:40.829 --> 34:43.832
tomorrow we remove
a threat to humanity.

34:45.918 --> 34:50.171
We will stop Ryker Kovalov
from ever selling a weapon

34:50.172 --> 34:51.632
or taking a life again.

34:53.967 --> 34:58.095
We take him dead or alive,
and we complete the mission

34:58.096 --> 35:00.516
whether we live or die!

35:03.852 --> 35:08.272
Here, we're foreigners
in a hostile land,

35:08.273 --> 35:10.901
and tomorrow, we'll be
completely on our own...

35:12.194 --> 35:13.904
but we are all we need.

35:14.863 --> 35:18.158
Because we are
Efile Noma Ephila!

35:27.334 --> 35:28.627
Get some rest.

35:29.378 --> 35:30.629
We move at midnight.

35:50.148 --> 35:53.652
Zero told me that you've been
after Kovalov for a long time.

35:55.863 --> 35:58.198
Is that why you're gonna be
boots on the ground tomorrow?

35:58.991 --> 36:00.576
Gonna take him down
face to face?

36:02.619 --> 36:04.412
Questioning my strategy,
Beckett?

36:04.413 --> 36:06.206
No, sir. I'm...

36:07.875 --> 36:09.251
I'm just saying...

36:10.043 --> 36:11.545
I know you have a family.

36:12.212 --> 36:14.756
There is no shame in supervising
this op from afar.

36:15.799 --> 36:21.305
A leader knows the way,
goes the way, and shows the way.

36:22.347 --> 36:25.851
Leadership is an action,
not a position.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.023
Understood.

36:37.112 --> 36:38.363
How is Zondi?

36:39.531 --> 36:40.699
Is he ready?

36:42.034 --> 36:43.076
He will be.

36:44.161 --> 36:45.787
I got one last lesson for him.

36:53.921 --> 36:55.088
What exactly are we doing here?

36:58.258 --> 36:59.551
There.

37:00.260 --> 37:01.345
By the door.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.181
That's your target.

37:07.392 --> 37:08.392
Take him out.

37:10.979 --> 37:12.105
You want me to shoot him?

37:13.357 --> 37:15.108
I want you
to eliminate the target.

37:16.360 --> 37:17.736
It's locked and loaded.

37:31.708 --> 37:32.709
Who is he?

37:34.336 --> 37:35.671
You're a soldier.

37:36.546 --> 37:38.047
You have your orders,
now follow.

37:45.514 --> 37:47.098
I don't even know who he is.

37:47.099 --> 37:49.434
This is one of Kovalov's guards.

37:50.560 --> 37:51.602
You take him out now,

37:51.603 --> 37:53.814
that's one less we have to deal
with during the raid tomorrow.

37:54.648 --> 37:56.900
- Is that true?
- It doesn't matter.

37:58.026 --> 38:00.696
When a superior orders you
to take a life, you follow it.

38:01.780 --> 38:04.950
You don't need a reason
because you trust your superior.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.786
Now, what's the distance?

38:11.873 --> 38:12.958
200 meters.

38:15.460 --> 38:16.753
Switch him off.

38:29.725 --> 38:31.600
What are you waiting for?

38:31.601 --> 38:33.228
You have your assignment.
Now shoot!

38:57.461 --> 38:58.587
Well done, Zondi.

39:08.388 --> 39:09.513
Who is he?

39:11.725 --> 39:14.352
No idea. Let's head back.

39:27.199 --> 39:29.117
What the fuck was that?

39:30.077 --> 39:31.078
A test.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.288
It's called
a stress fire exercise.

39:34.164 --> 39:35.415
And I failed.

39:38.543 --> 39:39.586
No.

39:40.337 --> 39:41.338
You passed.

39:43.256 --> 39:47.010
A lifetime ago,
when I was a jarhead, I failed.

39:48.178 --> 39:49.762
Couldn't pull the trigger.

39:49.763 --> 39:52.641
First time at least,
but I learned.

39:53.767 --> 39:57.354
And then you worked for the CIA
before joining G.R.I.T., right?

39:58.730 --> 40:00.732
Sounds like you've been
a little all over the place.

40:02.692 --> 40:05.028
No matter where I go,
I am a Marine.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.113
Like my father.

40:07.114 --> 40:08.489
Was your father a general?

40:08.490 --> 40:10.950
No. He never wanted that.

40:10.951 --> 40:12.326
Do you?

40:15.872 --> 40:17.916
You should be running ops,
and you know it.

40:19.292 --> 40:21.544
The entire squad
looks up to you.

40:21.545 --> 40:23.879
You heard the way they spoke.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.381
They saw you as a legend

40:25.382 --> 40:27.134
before you even
walked in the door.

40:28.093 --> 40:31.137
You have their respect,
and they would follow you.

40:31.138 --> 40:32.930
As I'm sure others would.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.432
Why haven't you stepped up?

40:35.809 --> 40:38.352
There's a big difference
between following an order,

40:38.353 --> 40:39.938
putting your own life
on the line,

40:40.730 --> 40:41.981
and giving that order,

40:41.982 --> 40:44.025
putting someone else's life
on the line.

40:45.694 --> 40:48.320
When things go south,
that blood is on your hands.

40:48.321 --> 40:51.700
Beckett, Zondi, it's time.
We're rolling out.

40:52.576 --> 40:55.078
You said to trust
a superior's orders, right?

40:56.288 --> 40:57.872
Well, trust is earned.

40:57.873 --> 41:00.124
And if you've
earned their trust,

41:00.125 --> 41:02.418
then a soldier putting
their life on the line for you

41:02.419 --> 41:05.338
is their choice, not yours.

41:18.685 --> 41:20.228
How's the kid doing?

41:23.356 --> 41:24.482
We'll find out in a few hours.

41:25.192 --> 41:26.151
Hmm.

41:26.943 --> 41:27.944
How about you?

41:28.695 --> 41:30.529
You ready to take down
your white whale?

41:30.530 --> 41:32.115
More than ever.

41:36.995 --> 41:37.996
Okay.

41:39.039 --> 41:40.457
Let's get to work.

42:12.239 --> 42:13.907
Hey, Beckett.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.160
What is, uh, your walk-out song?

42:20.997 --> 42:23.165
- My what?
- Your "walk-out" song.

42:23.166 --> 42:26.502
You know, when, uh, athletes go
in the stadium,

42:26.503 --> 42:28.504
they have that, uh, badass
song playing

42:28.505 --> 42:30.214
to make them, uh, pumped up.

42:30.215 --> 42:32.383
What do you listen
to before battle, eh?

42:32.384 --> 42:34.010
I'll... I'll put it on.

42:34.636 --> 42:37.972
Mine is "Welcome to the Jungle,"
Guns N' Roses.

42:37.973 --> 42:40.683
"R.E.D." Halluci Nation.

42:40.684 --> 42:42.101
Mandoza, "Nkalakatha."

42:42.102 --> 42:44.061
"Gossip Folks," Missy Elliot.

42:44.062 --> 42:47.690
"Eye of the Tiger" by Survivor.

42:47.691 --> 42:49.567
"War," Edwin Starr.

42:50.318 --> 42:51.652
"Hit Me With Your Best Shot."

42:51.653 --> 42:53.613
I'm a Swiftie myself.

42:54.948 --> 42:55.990
What?

42:55.991 --> 42:57.909
Don't. You guys,
she's a fucking legend.

42:58.827 --> 43:01.579
So, how about it?

43:02.330 --> 43:04.165
I dig all kinds of music, but...

43:05.208 --> 43:07.459
I'll take a little peace
and quiet before battle.

43:08.920 --> 43:11.297
Maybe
"The Sound of Silence", huh?

43:11.298 --> 43:12.381
Just my preference.

43:50.462 --> 43:51.755
It's go time, Shooter.

43:57.302 --> 43:59.888
I'll forever
be grateful, Commander.

44:00.305 --> 44:01.681
I'm glad
you included me on this.

44:02.640 --> 44:03.724
Rozie...

44:03.725 --> 44:05.184
If I did not include you,

44:05.185 --> 44:07.186
you would have been a nuisance
for the rest of my life.

44:07.187 --> 44:08.687
Oh, so you just
brought me in on this

44:08.688 --> 44:10.065
'cause you didn't want
to hear me complain?

44:12.067 --> 44:15.111
And because I know you want
Kovalov as badly as I do.

44:16.321 --> 44:17.447
I won't let you down, sir.

44:48.228 --> 44:49.478
<i>This is Overwatch.</i>

44:49.479 --> 44:50.563
<i>Requesting sitrep.</i>

44:52.440 --> 44:54.692
<i>Hera here. Here at the...</i>

45:00.073 --> 45:01.741
<i>Hilo. Check in.</i>

45:06.371 --> 45:08.581
<i>Anyone inside. Check in.</i>

45:11.668 --> 45:13.545
<i>Hera,
Overwatch coming to you.</i>

45:43.450 --> 45:45.285
Who the hell are you?

45:48.371 --> 45:49.914
Captain-fucking-Ahab.

45:52.917 --> 45:55.086
On your feet. Now!

46:08.600 --> 46:11.019
Delta Team.
Sitrep on all squads.

46:12.604 --> 46:14.104
<i>Overwatch entering compound.</i>

46:14.105 --> 46:15.148
<i>Heading to garage.</i>

46:18.526 --> 46:20.360
<i>Commander Modise here.</i>

46:20.361 --> 46:22.030
<i>Alpha and Bravo are with me.</i>

46:25.783 --> 46:28.202
<i>All guards have toe-tags.</i>

46:28.203 --> 46:31.039
<i>And both targets are in hand.</i>

46:33.124 --> 46:35.835
<i>All teams meet
at the rendezvous point inside.</i>

46:55.188 --> 46:57.147
You could have been killed!

46:57.148 --> 47:00.193
Yeah, but I wasn't.
You worry too much.

47:06.407 --> 47:07.449
What happened?

47:07.450 --> 47:08.534
The entire compound shook

47:08.535 --> 47:10.035
like there was some kind
of an earthquake.

47:10.036 --> 47:11.411
Is everyone okay?

47:11.412 --> 47:13.039
- Yeah.
- We're all gonna die.

47:13.998 --> 47:17.001
Maxim is just pissy
because his little toy failed.

47:18.169 --> 47:20.796
Kovalov got his hands
on some sonic wave weapon

47:20.797 --> 47:22.256
and pulled the trigger.

47:22.257 --> 47:23.340
We were tossed back,

47:23.341 --> 47:25.802
but I think
we walked away unharmed.

47:26.678 --> 47:27.845
It doesn't matter.

47:28.513 --> 47:30.390
You'll all be dead soon enough.

47:31.307 --> 47:33.725
A hundred armed men
are on their way here right now.

47:33.726 --> 47:34.811
Bullshit.

47:35.603 --> 47:37.187
How do you think
the Prime Minister feels

47:37.188 --> 47:40.065
about you cutting
off his weapon supply,

47:40.066 --> 47:42.610
and lightening his pockets, huh?

47:43.236 --> 47:45.697
You taking me away
takes away from him.

47:46.489 --> 47:48.491
His militia are coming.

47:49.075 --> 47:51.618
Even if you did get
a call out to Diaz,

47:51.619 --> 47:53.996
we have an hour
before the militia reaches us.

47:53.997 --> 47:55.747
You think
I didn't plan for this?

47:55.748 --> 47:57.583
We'll have everything we need
and be out of here

47:57.584 --> 47:59.626
by the time they arrive.

47:59.627 --> 48:00.752
All right, listen up, everyone.

48:00.753 --> 48:03.338
First up,
we need the information

48:03.339 --> 48:05.465
off the hard drives in the lab.

48:05.466 --> 48:07.009
We need to know everything

48:07.010 --> 48:08.510
about the weapons
they've created

48:08.511 --> 48:11.305
and who they sold them to.
Second--

48:16.686 --> 48:18.479
- Modise?
-Modise?

48:19.897 --> 48:20.898
Modise?

48:21.816 --> 48:23.234
- Modise?
-Modise?

48:26.070 --> 48:27.071
Bongani!

48:27.655 --> 48:29.073
Answer me.

48:33.620 --> 48:35.454
It worked.
It worked.

48:35.455 --> 48:37.332
What the hell is this weapon?

48:39.876 --> 48:42.045
- Chaos.
-Shit!

48:45.506 --> 48:46.633
Goddamn it!

48:48.009 --> 48:49.384
How do we stop this?

48:49.385 --> 48:50.552
You can't.

48:57.352 --> 48:58.686
What the hell is going on?

49:01.481 --> 49:03.149
No, no, no, no. Nadia?

49:04.859 --> 49:06.568
Jansen! Jansen?

49:06.569 --> 49:09.155
No. No, no, no! Sello!

49:11.074 --> 49:12.325
Jedd! Jedd!

49:14.285 --> 49:15.286
No.

49:21.668 --> 49:22.793
Hilo!

49:26.964 --> 49:29.466
I told you to hold.

49:29.467 --> 49:32.095
Why didn't you hold?

49:41.312 --> 49:42.563
Everyone is dead.

49:43.856 --> 49:45.190
How is this possible?

49:45.191 --> 49:47.025
What the hell is going on?

49:47.026 --> 49:48.903
They were all in the room.

49:50.363 --> 49:51.656
When the weapon was fired.

49:53.366 --> 49:54.574
Were you?

49:54.575 --> 49:56.785
No, I was in the hall.

49:56.786 --> 49:59.204
A piece of ceiling fell on me
after the explosion.

49:59.205 --> 50:00.956
You were out
of the blast radius.

50:00.957 --> 50:02.709
That probably saved your life.

50:03.835 --> 50:05.044
Why weren't you in the room?

50:05.962 --> 50:07.921
After Alpha went in,
a guard came out of nowhere.

50:07.922 --> 50:09.214
I had to neutralize him.

50:09.215 --> 50:11.758
Bravo team
was supposed to secure the lab.

50:11.759 --> 50:14.177
Make sure none
of those weapons went off.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.179
Hang on.
How was I supposed to stop it?

50:16.180 --> 50:17.723
I don't even know
what the hell it looks like.

50:17.724 --> 50:18.890
You follow your
commander's orders,

50:18.891 --> 50:20.392
and you do the assignment.

50:20.393 --> 50:21.601
No matter the obstacle.

50:21.602 --> 50:22.937
You weren't there!

50:23.229 --> 50:24.689
Guys, guys, guys,
what are we gonna do?

50:25.314 --> 50:26.315
Huh?

50:28.818 --> 50:30.110
We have to go.

50:30.111 --> 50:31.904
Half of our team just died.

50:32.572 --> 50:33.655
I realize that.

50:33.656 --> 50:35.657
But we don't have time to mourn.

50:35.658 --> 50:38.118
We have a hundred militia
on their way here right now.

50:38.119 --> 50:40.203
Modise would have wanted us
to take the fallen soldiers

50:40.204 --> 50:41.622
home to be buried.

50:42.373 --> 50:43.624
How do we do that?

50:44.584 --> 50:45.793
We take them
to the vehicles.

50:47.044 --> 50:48.503
We dismantled them.

50:48.504 --> 50:50.172
There's no way
to fix them in time.

50:50.173 --> 50:51.965
Okay, well, what about taking
them out of the tunnels

50:51.966 --> 50:53.801
- we came in?
- Angel.

50:55.219 --> 50:56.554
We can't carry them all.

50:57.638 --> 50:59.640
Are you gonna choose
who we leave behind?

51:01.142 --> 51:03.394
- We are leaving no one.
- Okay, okay, okay.

51:05.521 --> 51:08.065
Beckett,
what are we going to do?

51:13.446 --> 51:14.447
Beckett...

51:15.573 --> 51:16.574
what do we do?

51:20.787 --> 51:22.663
How can a weapon
have such a delayed effect?

51:23.873 --> 51:25.791
Well, yeah,
that was Maxim's job.

51:25.792 --> 51:28.752
To create the next phase
of weaponry.

51:28.753 --> 51:31.755
Clearly, this was some
kind of technology

51:31.756 --> 51:32.924
we've never seen before.

51:45.186 --> 51:46.187
Hmm.

51:47.313 --> 51:48.648
I can't believe
this is happening.

51:50.149 --> 51:51.150
These weapons...

51:52.026 --> 51:53.110
I couldn't stop it.

51:54.278 --> 51:55.780
And Modise...

51:57.990 --> 51:59.533
I let him down, B.

51:59.534 --> 52:02.203
No, you didn't.

52:04.580 --> 52:06.164
Because we're gonna
finish this assignment.

52:06.165 --> 52:07.582
We gotta do something.

52:07.583 --> 52:08.917
Make sure
this never happens again.

52:08.918 --> 52:11.336
...a little housecleaning?
Look like cowards?

52:11.337 --> 52:13.046
Huh? Is that
what we're gonna do?

52:13.047 --> 52:14.130
- Just walk away?
- Yeah.

52:14.131 --> 52:16.007
Just put everyone away
and be cowards?

52:16.008 --> 52:17.259
We're better than this.

52:17.260 --> 52:19.719
I know you're angry,
but there's no vengeance

52:19.720 --> 52:21.930
to be had when
the killer's already dead.

52:21.931 --> 52:23.182
Okay.

52:24.725 --> 52:25.851
Okay.

52:25.852 --> 52:26.935
Let's all take a breath.

52:26.936 --> 52:28.646
Who put you in charge?

52:30.064 --> 52:32.400
No one, Angel.
But my mind is clear.

52:33.401 --> 52:34.569
Is yours?

52:37.280 --> 52:39.865
We have to stay calm. Focused.

52:39.866 --> 52:41.367
As tough as that might be
right now.

52:42.535 --> 52:44.495
Hera, Zondi, Angel,

52:45.496 --> 52:46.998
take our teams
to the tunnel for now.

52:47.957 --> 52:52.128
Zero, Nova, you're with me.
I need to see this weapon.

53:13.733 --> 53:15.318
Computer still has juice.

53:16.611 --> 53:17.777
So, this is it.

53:17.778 --> 53:20.989
Kovalov had no idea how powerful
Maxim's creation was.

53:20.990 --> 53:24.994
This is a kind of next-gen
weapon Kovalov is known for.

53:25.912 --> 53:27.579
The device uses microwave
frequencies

53:27.580 --> 53:29.414
to disrupt brain function.

53:29.415 --> 53:31.416
I remember Modise talking
about a similar weapon

53:31.417 --> 53:33.168
that Kovalov sold
to North Korea.

53:33.169 --> 53:34.294
That's right.

53:34.295 --> 53:36.631
I think like two dozen soldiers
got sick when they tested it.

53:37.298 --> 53:40.592
It was developed further in 2021
and sold to Russia.

53:40.593 --> 53:45.221
130 protesters developed
symptoms like dizziness, nausea,

53:45.222 --> 53:47.724
headaches, and blackouts
when it was used on them.

53:47.725 --> 53:49.477
And this is the next phase.

53:50.394 --> 53:52.772
Maxim amplified the technology
to make it lethal.

53:54.857 --> 53:56.484
<i>Ay, Dios mío.</i>
It gets worse, guys.

53:57.652 --> 53:59.194
Maxim was actually working

53:59.195 --> 54:01.404
on making it
handheld and silent.

54:01.405 --> 54:03.199
You guys,
we have to destroy this weapon.

54:03.950 --> 54:06.953
Before we destroy it,
we need to understand it.

54:07.828 --> 54:10.288
If this incoming militia
gets a hold of this tech,

54:10.289 --> 54:11.998
Roman Diaz is gonna build it.

54:11.999 --> 54:15.044
If that happens, the world
needs to know how to stop it.

54:17.171 --> 54:18.421
All right, you heard the man.

54:18.422 --> 54:20.173
Nova, grab the hard drive.
Let's go.

54:26.347 --> 54:27.556
Have you seen all these servers?

54:28.933 --> 54:31.267
I cannot just throw them
onto my back.

54:31.268 --> 54:34.270
Okay, uh,
what about the vehicles?

54:34.271 --> 54:36.523
I mean, from what Hera said,
they're inoperable.

54:36.524 --> 54:37.941
Either way,
there's not enough room

54:37.942 --> 54:39.443
in any vehicle to throw this in.

54:40.194 --> 54:41.195
Sorry.

54:50.621 --> 54:51.622
B?

54:52.999 --> 54:54.333
What are you thinking?

54:57.837 --> 54:59.713
<i>Modise said
he parked a satellite overhead.</i>

54:59.714 --> 55:02.383
<i>Nova, can you get
into it from here?</i>

55:04.802 --> 55:06.804
I mean, it's...
it's possible, yeah.

55:09.265 --> 55:11.391
If we can't carry
that system out,

55:11.392 --> 55:13.184
then we transfer all the data
up to the satellite

55:13.185 --> 55:14.936
so we can send it to agencies
around the world.

55:14.937 --> 55:17.105
So, we start the upload
and then we bug out.

55:17.106 --> 55:18.399
We upload it,
then we destroy it.

55:18.858 --> 55:19.899
We leave nothing behind.

55:19.900 --> 55:22.360
Okay, but that kind of upload
is gonna take time,

55:22.361 --> 55:23.903
and time is something
we don't have a lot of.

55:23.904 --> 55:25.613
We can never
let this information

55:25.614 --> 55:26.906
fall into the wrong hands.

55:27.992 --> 55:31.078
So, we hold. We fight.

55:32.121 --> 55:33.164
That is suicide.

55:33.789 --> 55:36.666
We need to triple our squad
and get some serious firepower.

55:36.667 --> 55:38.293
This is a fight we cannot win.

55:38.294 --> 55:40.336
If we can't win,
then we die trying.

55:40.337 --> 55:41.421
Efile Noma Ephila.

55:41.422 --> 55:42.964
- Remember?
- We're severely outnumbered.

55:42.965 --> 55:44.132
I know.
What the fuck are we gonna do?

55:44.133 --> 55:45.383
Are you mad? Do you want

55:45.384 --> 55:46.468
to stay here
and listen to this man?

55:46.469 --> 55:47.594
Just listen to him.

55:47.595 --> 55:49.597
Everyone, ease down.

55:51.390 --> 55:52.767
This is Modise's final order.

55:53.642 --> 55:55.686
You get that intel
off those hard drives.

55:57.271 --> 55:58.397
Weapons Maxim created.

55:59.482 --> 56:01.650
Who Kovalov sold them to,
how to stop them.

56:02.818 --> 56:05.988
If we can see that through,
we'll save countless lives.

56:07.740 --> 56:09.866
Now that to me
is a fight worth fighting.

56:13.579 --> 56:15.039
Now, I can't make
any of you stay.

56:15.873 --> 56:17.041
But if you do...

56:17.833 --> 56:21.045
I will show you
how the six of us become 60.

56:23.047 --> 56:24.507
Because this is where we fight.

56:25.966 --> 56:28.010
This is where we make our stand.

56:40.272 --> 56:41.398
All right, Beckett.

56:43.275 --> 56:44.527
What's your plan?

56:45.945 --> 56:47.445
We were an off-books mission,

56:47.446 --> 56:49.198
so there is no
EVAC team standing by.

56:50.157 --> 56:52.033
<i>Nova will reach out
to his Phoenix squad.</i>

56:52.034 --> 56:54.452
<i>Modise said calling them
is the last of all last resorts,</i>

56:54.453 --> 56:55.870
<i>but that is where we are at.</i>

56:55.871 --> 56:58.456
Paz, this is Nova.
We need your help.

56:58.457 --> 57:00.750
<i>We'll hope they get
here before the militia does.</i>

57:00.751 --> 57:02.961
<i>In the meantime,
we get ready for war.</i>

57:02.962 --> 57:04.629
<i>Let's gather whatever munitions
we can find,</i>

57:04.630 --> 57:06.089
<i>see what we have to work with.</i>

57:06.090 --> 57:07.258
It isn't much.

57:08.092 --> 57:09.385
Then we'll have to get creative.

57:17.476 --> 57:20.311
I got word that a caravan
of vehicles is heading our way.

57:20.312 --> 57:21.855
It has to be militia.

57:21.856 --> 57:22.939
<i>How far out?</i>

57:22.940 --> 57:24.150
<i>Thirty minutes,
give or take.</i>

57:26.110 --> 57:28.779
<i>Hera, take position
near the garage.</i>

57:29.905 --> 57:31.866
<i>Angel,
you're on the east rooftop.</i>

57:33.159 --> 57:35.119
<i>Zero, south rooftop.</i>

57:36.954 --> 57:39.664
<i>Zondi,
you're lead sniper on this.</i>

57:39.665 --> 57:41.083
<i>Post up in the tower.</i>

57:44.128 --> 57:46.337
We'll create sectors of fire

57:46.338 --> 57:48.465
with overlapping coverage
from each angle.

57:50.092 --> 57:54.012
We will turn this courtyard
into a militia graveyard.

57:54.013 --> 57:55.389
Where will you be?

57:56.307 --> 57:58.267
On the ground,
in the thick of it.

57:58.976 --> 58:00.895
So, let's watch
the friendly fire, people.

58:02.062 --> 58:03.938
Even with our
courtyard kill box,

58:03.939 --> 58:06.317
eventually those bodies
are gonna overwhelm us.

58:07.151 --> 58:09.069
So, we need to lure
them deeper into the facility.

58:10.487 --> 58:12.239
There we can create
secondary kill zones,

58:13.032 --> 58:14.532
where we can spread them out
and take them out,

58:14.533 --> 58:15.743
a handful at a time.

58:17.244 --> 58:19.955
Nova's gonna stay in the lab,
working on that upload.

58:20.664 --> 58:23.709
We'll protect that room
at all costs until he is done.

58:25.336 --> 58:26.794
When he confirms it's done,

58:26.795 --> 58:29.255
we'll cut the power inside
and go dark.

58:29.256 --> 58:31.425
We get to those tunnels,
get the hell out of here.

58:32.259 --> 58:33.593
We rendezvous
at the private docks

58:33.594 --> 58:35.221
where Modise's boat
is waiting for us.

58:37.598 --> 58:42.895
Remember,
we are <i>Efile Noma Ephila.</i>

58:43.646 --> 58:45.647
We take our enemies,
dead or alive.

58:47.358 --> 58:49.400
And the mission is completed...

58:49.401 --> 58:51.737
Whether we live or die.

59:33.612 --> 59:34.613
How are we looking?

59:35.322 --> 59:37.366
Fifty percent. It's--

59:38.242 --> 59:39.535
It's gonna be close.

59:47.209 --> 59:48.711
I know these missions
can get messy.

59:49.837 --> 59:50.879
Bad things can happen.

59:51.714 --> 59:53.506
So, it's okay to be
a little rattled.

59:53.507 --> 59:54.675
A little scared.

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:01.724
We do the job anyway.

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:11.025
This is your
last line of defense.

01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:14.902
The hallway is rigged with cubes
of Semtex plastic explosives,

01:00:14.903 --> 01:00:16.405
connected to this burner phone.

01:00:18.115 --> 01:00:20.200
You hear danger come and you
dial the first saved number.

01:00:21.285 --> 01:00:23.119
I labeled it "Hallway."

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.539
Do not dial
the second saved number.

01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:28.417
That's connected
to the charges in this room.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.049
We dial that number when we're
in the tunnels out of here.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.552
- Understood?
- Yeah.

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:41.347
What's that one labeled as?

01:00:43.057 --> 01:00:44.058
"Run."

01:00:48.937 --> 01:00:50.064
Angel...

01:00:51.774 --> 01:00:53.567
Are we good?

01:00:55.611 --> 01:00:57.529
Yes. We are good.

01:00:58.614 --> 01:01:00.365
Beckett made the right call.

01:01:00.366 --> 01:01:01.533
Staying.

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:03.786
Fighting.

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.038
It's what Modise
would have done.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:15.297
You and I are the same,
you know?

01:01:16.924 --> 01:01:19.217
Except that I didn't get stabbed
11 times by a lunatic

01:01:19.218 --> 01:01:20.302
in an inferno.

01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:26.475
I, uh...

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:31.230
I was NYPD when the towers fell.

01:01:33.107 --> 01:01:34.483
So many people
were running away.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:37.444
And I ran forward.

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:40.697
Tried to help
as many as I could.

01:01:45.077 --> 01:01:47.537
See, people like us,
we run towards danger

01:01:47.538 --> 01:01:48.914
if it means helping others.

01:01:49.957 --> 01:01:52.751
An operation like this is won
or lost in preparation.

01:01:53.877 --> 01:01:55.754
We also have to be
prepared to adapt.

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:57.798
To adjust.

01:02:01.844 --> 01:02:03.303
To do whatever it takes.

01:02:05.431 --> 01:02:06.849
We're gonna
get through this, Angel.

01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:10.227
Your daughter's gonna
see her mother again.

01:02:14.815 --> 01:02:15.816
Okay.

01:02:18.694 --> 01:02:19.820
Let's get to our positions.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.125
Tell me what you see.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.337
I see a good vantage point.

01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:41.300
I see the squadron position.

01:02:43.469 --> 01:02:45.721
I see all the ways
that this could go sideways.

01:02:46.472 --> 01:02:47.973
But I also don't see
another way.

01:02:49.641 --> 01:02:50.809
How do you feel?

01:02:52.019 --> 01:02:53.061
Prepared.

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:56.231
And how did it feel?

01:02:57.524 --> 01:02:58.525
How did what feel?

01:03:11.872 --> 01:03:14.124
I wasn't as fazed about it
as I thought I would be.

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:19.087
What does that say about me?

01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:25.469
It's your mind prioritizing.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.221
Protecting itself.

01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:30.390
Knowing that you'll save lives
by taking another.

01:03:32.351 --> 01:03:33.936
Keep your powder dry, kid.

01:03:37.773 --> 01:03:38.940
What does that mean?

01:03:40.859 --> 01:03:42.319
Something my dad
used to say to me.

01:03:43.695 --> 01:03:46.572
In the old days, it meant,
"Keep your gunpowder dry."

01:03:46.573 --> 01:03:48.408
So, it actually would
ignite when fired.

01:03:49.201 --> 01:03:52.079
Nowadays it just means,
"Stay ready."

01:03:55.082 --> 01:03:56.207
<i>Satellite thermals</i>

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:57.542
<i>on the incoming militia caravan</i>

01:03:57.543 --> 01:03:59.460
<i>show 80 to 90 warm bodies.</i>

01:03:59.461 --> 01:04:02.338
<i>There's so many of them.</i>

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:04.173
Everyone,
if you're not already there,

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.384
get to your spots.

01:04:07.636 --> 01:04:09.596
Are you really gonna be
on the ground out front?

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:11.682
Leadership's an action.

01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:13.474
Not a position.

01:04:31.577 --> 01:04:33.120
How we doing, team?

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:35.622
This wait is the worst.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.421
For a moment there,
I almost checked in with Hilo.

01:04:43.005 --> 01:04:46.592
<i>When we first connected,
I became someone different.</i>

01:04:48.594 --> 01:04:49.969
<i>Lighter.</i>

01:04:49.970 --> 01:04:51.138
<i>And now that he's gone...</i>

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:54.224
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

01:04:55.726 --> 01:04:57.853
<i>You are
who you've always been, Hera.</i>

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:01.189
Honorable fighter
who never quits.

01:05:03.275 --> 01:05:05.611
<i>Hilo knew the risks. We all do.</i>

01:05:07.195 --> 01:05:08.322
He told me once...

01:05:09.615 --> 01:05:11.073
"Soldiers aren't
built to retire."

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:16.204
Squad...

01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:18.915
we're gonna complete
this assignment.

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:22.586
<i>For Hilo. For Modise.
And for all of them...</i>

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:25.130
<i>Because that's our job.</i>

01:05:26.089 --> 01:05:27.757
<i>We fight without fear.</i>

01:05:27.758 --> 01:05:29.968
<i>We pull that trigger
so other people don't have to.</i>

01:05:31.011 --> 01:05:32.345
<i>So they can sleep peacefully,</i>

01:05:32.346 --> 01:05:34.681
<i>not having to know about
these monsters in the dark.</i>

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:39.060
<i>Today we're fighting
for the freedom of Costa Verde.</i>

01:05:39.061 --> 01:05:40.645
<i>And the only thing
more important</i>

01:05:40.646 --> 01:05:42.480
<i>than fighting
for your own freedom</i>

01:05:42.481 --> 01:05:44.483
is fighting for someone else's.

01:05:56.578 --> 01:05:58.245
Three hundred meters
from the front gate...

01:05:58.246 --> 01:05:59.830
Lock and load.

01:05:59.831 --> 01:06:02.875
Stay ready, watch your six.
We'll get through this.

01:06:02.876 --> 01:06:05.544
These fuckers have no idea
what's about to stop them.

01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:59.641
[ON RADIO] <i>Wait for it.</i>

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:05.647
<i>Lay down the smoke.</i>

01:07:21.288 --> 01:07:22.289
<i>Hold your fire.</i>

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:24.666
<i>I'm going in.</i>

01:07:50.484 --> 01:07:51.692
<i>Beckett, take cover.</i>

01:07:51.693 --> 01:07:52.861
<i>Smoke is clearing.</i>

01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:00.869
<i>Ready, squad. Make it rain.</i>

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.909
Yeah. Of course
she set a guy on fire.

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:43.078
Who wouldn't?

01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:28.956
<i>This is Hera.</i>

01:09:28.957 --> 01:09:30.458
I'm EVAC'ing the garage.
I'm on the move.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:32.376
<i>Hera!</i>

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:33.962
Go! I got your six!

01:09:44.764 --> 01:09:45.764
Fuck!

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:45.492
You guys chose
the wrong woman to chase.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:32.682
<i>Phoenix squad,
incoming technical.</i>

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:45.987
Back there.
Take out the tower, now!

01:12:57.207 --> 01:12:59.125
Zero, crossfire on technical.

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:14.307
<i>Zondi, stay down.</i>

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:27.570
<i>This is Angel.</i>

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.448
<i>Leaving rooftop.
Heading to secondary kill zone.</i>

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:34.119
Shit!

01:14:02.814 --> 01:14:04.064
A dozen more just came in.

01:14:04.065 --> 01:14:06.692
<i>Everyone fall back
to secondary kill zones.</i>

01:14:06.693 --> 01:14:09.654
Yeah. Secondary kill zone. Copy.

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:45.917
Angel!

01:15:46.751 --> 01:15:48.210
Are you good?

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:49.504
Yes, I'm good.

01:15:50.505 --> 01:15:51.588
Yeah.

01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:53.007
Okay, let's go.

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:54.509
Come.

01:16:11.442 --> 01:16:12.859
I'm dry.
How many shots you got left?

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:13.945
Enough.

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:21.910
Let's split these guys up.

01:16:21.911 --> 01:16:23.871
- Kitchen, office.
- Sounds like a plan.

01:16:35.883 --> 01:16:37.301
Shit!

01:16:46.394 --> 01:16:48.229
Hey, fellas.

01:18:01.803 --> 01:18:02.803
Fuck.

01:18:15.274 --> 01:18:16.483
Come on!

01:18:23.074 --> 01:18:24.951
Sorry, kid.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:37.713
Any last words?

01:18:39.757 --> 01:18:41.134
You just said them.

01:19:13.374 --> 01:19:14.459
Lordy!

01:19:18.296 --> 01:19:19.881
God! This is exhausting.

01:19:26.429 --> 01:19:28.054
B, how are we doing?

01:20:00.838 --> 01:20:02.297
Beckett here.
I'm heading your way.

01:20:06.594 --> 01:20:07.595
Drop it!

01:21:23.963 --> 01:21:25.965
Nova, how much time?

01:21:26.757 --> 01:21:28.925
<i>Almost complete. 98 percent.</i>

01:21:28.926 --> 01:21:30.595
<i>But I hear someone coming.</i>

01:21:31.053 --> 01:21:32.388
Dial the saved number one.

01:21:32.972 --> 01:21:34.472
<i>One. Hear me?</i>

01:21:53.034 --> 01:21:54.201
Nova. Sitrep.

01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:56.287
Nova. Come back.

01:21:59.248 --> 01:22:00.290
Nova, I'm heading to you.

01:22:21.687 --> 01:22:23.772
Anyone near the office?

01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:25.023
I'm pinned down!

01:22:25.024 --> 01:22:26.108
Shit!

01:22:27.735 --> 01:22:28.986
I'm coming to you, B.

01:22:30.613 --> 01:22:31.614
Frag out!

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:42.124
<i>All clear.</i>

01:22:46.796 --> 01:22:49.131
<i>Hey. Nova here. Got good news.</i>

01:22:49.632 --> 01:22:50.632
Upload complete.

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:55.428
<i>I say again, upload complete.</i>

01:22:59.850 --> 01:23:00.851
Going dark.

01:23:01.727 --> 01:23:06.148
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:10.694
<i>six, five, four...</i>

01:23:10.695 --> 01:23:11.821
Oh, no.

01:23:12.655 --> 01:23:15.866
-<i>...three, two, one...

01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:21.287
Hera here. NV is dead.

01:23:21.288 --> 01:23:23.581
Anyone close to the bunks?

01:23:23.582 --> 01:23:25.084
<i>I'm coming to you, Hera.</i>

01:23:25.418 --> 01:23:27.128
<i>I can't see shit.</i>

01:23:39.014 --> 01:23:40.099
Beckett?

01:24:22.349 --> 01:24:23.433
Hera's down.

01:24:23.434 --> 01:24:25.268
I say again, Hera's down.

01:24:25.269 --> 01:24:26.770
Nova, where are you?

01:24:26.771 --> 01:24:28.522
<i>Just left the lab.</i>

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:32.817
<i>Charges set.
Got burners to blow when clear.</i>

01:24:32.818 --> 01:24:35.695
Everyone get to the tunnels.
Mission complete.

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:36.781
<i>On my way.</i>

01:24:37.698 --> 01:24:39.283
Nova, stay inside.

01:24:39.867 --> 01:24:41.910
Do not cut through
the courtyard, understand?

01:24:41.911 --> 01:24:44.162
Do you copy?

01:25:56.819 --> 01:25:58.445
God damn it.

01:25:59.613 --> 01:26:01.573
How the hell
did that get through?

01:26:01.574 --> 01:26:03.575
Luck, I guess.

01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:04.952
Mine finally ran out.

01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:17.089
Nova, get down!

01:26:40.613 --> 01:26:42.364
I got you. I got you.

01:26:58.422 --> 01:27:00.381
Upload... Upload complete.

01:27:04.637 --> 01:27:05.887
You're gonna be okay.

01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:07.013
Listen to me, Nova.

01:27:07.014 --> 01:27:09.057
You're gonna be okay.
We're gonna get you out of here.

01:27:09.058 --> 01:27:10.809
We're gonna get you bandaged up.
You just hang on.

01:27:12.561 --> 01:27:14.188
Speed dial two, right?

01:27:14.939 --> 01:27:16.105
You did it, Nova.

01:27:16.106 --> 01:27:19.108
The Phoenix Rebellion will rise.
And the true Diaz name

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:21.235
will always be remembered
because of you.

01:27:22.655 --> 01:27:24.782
Thank you for showing the way.

01:27:50.891 --> 01:27:51.892
Get ready!

01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:56.271
Lab detonation
in three, two, one.

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:14.123
We can't hold here any longer.

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:20.712
Beckett.

01:28:20.713 --> 01:28:21.963
Are you okay?

01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:24.216
There's only about a dozen
or so militia left.

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:27.343
Head to the tunnels.

01:28:28.721 --> 01:28:30.555
I'll lay down cover
so you all can escape.

01:28:30.556 --> 01:28:32.181
You go. I'll stay.

01:28:33.559 --> 01:28:35.894
Your family died with honor
on the battlefield, Zondi.

01:28:36.437 --> 01:28:37.688
That is their legacy.

01:28:38.147 --> 01:28:39.148
Not yours.

01:28:39.982 --> 01:28:41.316
You are not dying
on my watch, kid.

01:28:44.778 --> 01:28:47.740
Angel, finish what
Modise started.

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:51.744
Make sure that intel gets
to every agency on the planet.

01:28:57.458 --> 01:28:59.918
Phoenix Squad,
mission accomplished.

01:29:01.003 --> 01:29:02.004
Time to go home.

01:29:03.756 --> 01:29:05.466
I am proud to serve with you.

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:07.509
All of you.

01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:10.345
With all due respect, B,

01:29:12.222 --> 01:29:13.223
you can fuck right off.

01:29:13.932 --> 01:29:16.226
You stay, I stay.

01:29:16.727 --> 01:29:18.854
Costa Verde's the assignment
that brought us together.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:21.189
It's only fair
it's the assignment

01:29:21.190 --> 01:29:22.815
we see through to the end.

01:29:22.816 --> 01:29:23.901
Together.

01:29:28.197 --> 01:29:29.198
On my signal.

01:29:32.034 --> 01:29:33.327
Go! Go! Go!

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:02.689
Shit!

01:30:33.512 --> 01:30:35.012
The cavalry arrived.

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:36.557
Just in time.

01:30:39.351 --> 01:30:41.603
You must be what's left
of the Phoenix squad.

01:30:42.479 --> 01:30:43.730
- We need to move.
- Nova.

01:30:44.231 --> 01:30:45.273
He's in the garage.

01:30:45.274 --> 01:30:46.358
We can't leave him there.

01:30:46.900 --> 01:30:48.776
There's two friendlies inside.

01:30:48.777 --> 01:30:50.862
Our fallen. One's in a bunk.

01:30:50.863 --> 01:30:52.446
The rest are in the tunnel.

01:30:52.447 --> 01:30:53.699
We'll get them all.

01:30:56.118 --> 01:30:57.744
You get to the vehicle.

01:30:58.745 --> 01:30:59.745
Let's go.

01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:06.085
God, that was close, B.

01:31:07.629 --> 01:31:10.174
Honored you stood
by my side 'til the end.

01:31:10.549 --> 01:31:12.342
There's no other way, brother.

01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:24.687
He's got a pulse.

01:31:55.886 --> 01:31:58.721
Zondi and I have a few things
we need to clean up.

01:31:58.722 --> 01:32:00.223
Then we'll catch
the next boat out,

01:32:00.224 --> 01:32:01.391
right after you guys.

01:32:02.893 --> 01:32:03.894
I'm staying.

01:32:05.145 --> 01:32:08.232
I don't know where I'm needed
more than here. Right now.

01:32:09.942 --> 01:32:11.610
Well, it's a dangerous idea.

01:32:12.694 --> 01:32:13.820
But I respect it.

01:32:14.905 --> 01:32:16.156
They're lucky to have you.

01:32:17.658 --> 01:32:20.577
Well, we,
on the other hand, can't stay.

01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:22.328
Either one of us
gets caught here,

01:32:22.329 --> 01:32:24.748
this becomes an international
incident real quick.

01:32:25.624 --> 01:32:27.708
The boat will take you
a few kilometers out.

01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:29.961
Modise's friends will be waiting
to pick you guys up.

01:32:29.962 --> 01:32:32.005
Modise would be very proud
of you both.

01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:34.967
I'd give you
a goodbye hug but...

01:32:35.509 --> 01:32:39.012
I'm pretty sore in...
every general area.

01:32:40.389 --> 01:32:43.724
I'm sorry, I... couldn't pick
that up. What did you say?

01:32:43.725 --> 01:32:46.519
Hey... it's not an eye.

01:32:49.940 --> 01:32:51.275
We'll meet in the future.

01:32:51.984 --> 01:32:53.277
Definitely.

01:32:53.777 --> 01:32:56.029
So,
what do you think about...

01:32:57.281 --> 01:32:58.782
giving orders
instead of taking them?

01:32:59.866 --> 01:33:02.536
Haven't had time
to process it yet.

01:33:04.079 --> 01:33:06.581
You always say,
"Tell me what you see."

01:33:07.708 --> 01:33:08.874
I see someone

01:33:08.875 --> 01:33:11.003
that I would follow
into the fray

01:33:11.503 --> 01:33:13.922
anytime, anyplace.

01:33:14.631 --> 01:33:15.715
Hmm.

01:33:15.716 --> 01:33:17.092
I might hold you to that.

01:33:19.094 --> 01:33:20.762
Keep your powder dry, Zondi.

01:33:23.974 --> 01:33:25.559
Let's get to work, Rozie.

01:33:26.351 --> 01:33:28.519
God, you are never gonna
let that go, are you?
