WEBVTT

00:13.639 --> 00:15.973
<i>Devon!</i>

00:15.974 --> 00:19.685
<i>No.
Listen, we're not happy, we're miserable.</i>

00:19.686 --> 00:20.938
Burt!

00:21.772 --> 00:24.232
- They torture us down there!
- <i>Devon!</i>

00:24.233 --> 00:25.525
<i>We're prisoners!</i>

00:25.526 --> 00:26.943
<i>Burt!</i>

00:26.944 --> 00:28.111
She's alive!

00:35.202 --> 00:37.245
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

00:37.246 --> 00:39.247
Mark?
Here. Will you take her for a second?

00:39.248 --> 00:41.457
- It's okay. I got her. Yeah.
- Be careful with her.

00:41.458 --> 00:43.502
- Don't go far though.
- I won't.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.087
Mark.

00:49.675 --> 00:50.676
So, this is you now?

00:52.010 --> 00:53.010
Yeah.

00:53.011 --> 00:54.096
Are you okay?

00:54.721 --> 00:55.722
Yeah.

00:56.515 --> 00:58.433
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:00.644 --> 01:01.645
What's my name?

01:04.690 --> 01:05.858
Persephone.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.235
Can you spell that?

01:08.861 --> 01:10.946
- Never.
- Okay.

01:11.530 --> 01:12.363
Babe...

01:12.364 --> 01:14.616
- Okay.
- ...need help with this diaper.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.284
Oh, boy.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.828
I think she wants mommy.

02:15.761 --> 02:17.137
Fetid moppet.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.559
Father.

02:33.654 --> 02:36.280
We'll have someone
from the floor liaise with the outies.

02:36.281 --> 02:40.244
We need to find out
who they talked to. Promptly.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.457
<i>I need you to go see all of them.</i>

03:28.458 --> 03:31.294
Find out every word they said
and who they said it to.

03:31.295 --> 03:32.838
And shall I fire them?

03:33.589 --> 03:35.339
Let Kier guide your hand.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.508
Of course.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.968
Please, sit.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.890
We've commandeered the footage
taken by guests.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.976
Natalie is already
doing outreach to media.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.813
And the severed employees
who were involved are being dealt with.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.201
Thank you for acting so quickly.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.453
You saved us from disaster.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.789
Will Mr. Eagan be joining?

04:49.790 --> 04:50.874
Just me.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.254
I personally owe you a debt of gratitude.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.051
It cost me dearly.

05:02.761 --> 05:03.762
It did.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.349
And still,
you proved your loyalty tonight.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.479
Which is why we'd like to ask you back.

05:22.114 --> 05:26.410
An apology is warranted.

05:33.584 --> 05:34.668
I apologize.

05:37.629 --> 05:39.089
My father apologizes.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.509
The Board apologizes.

05:44.720 --> 05:45.971
We've treated you poorly.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.683
I'm sorry.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.984
I welcome your contrition.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.779
I'm so glad.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.410
There's much damage to control.

06:10.162 --> 06:12.914
I recommend we start by scouring the feed,

06:12.915 --> 06:17.126
and I need to interview Dylan G.
to see how he gained access to the--

06:17.127 --> 06:18.795
We have something else in mind.

06:23.008 --> 06:24.760
We'd like to offer you a promotion.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.393
Severance Advisory Council.

06:44.613 --> 06:47.074
I never heard of such a thing.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.495
It's a brand-new initiative.
You'd be spearheading its formation.

06:53.372 --> 06:55.332
Your expertise is greatly valued.

07:02.464 --> 07:08.178
Which is why
I should be running the severed floor.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.727
Mr. Milchick
has been promoted to floor manager.

07:23.569 --> 07:25.571
You don't value me.

07:29.283 --> 07:30.284
You fear me.

07:34.746 --> 07:35.789
We fear no one.

07:44.006 --> 07:46.257
<i>And if we didn't hold you
in such high esteem,</i>

07:46.258 --> 07:48.719
we wouldn't be making this generous offer.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.313
I'll put some thought to it.

08:06.195 --> 08:10.365
Thank you for coming in, Harmony.
Mr. Drummond will see you out.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.077
<i>I don't need an escort.</i>

08:44.858 --> 08:46.068
Ready?

08:54.618 --> 08:55.701
<i>Earlier this evening,</i>

08:55.702 --> 08:59.205
<i>at an event where I was excited
to share my status as a severed individual</i>

08:59.206 --> 09:01.124
<i>with a group of friends and allies,</i>

09:02.084 --> 09:04.085
<i>I made the poor decision
to consume alcohol</i>

09:04.086 --> 09:06.630
<i>while on a non-Lumon medication
for an arm rash.</i>

09:08.423 --> 09:10.217
<i>This had an inebriating effect,</i>

09:10.759 --> 09:13.595
<i>which caused me
to say some deeply regrettable things.</i>

09:16.306 --> 09:18.600
- Mr. Milchick.
- Apologies for the hour.

09:19.309 --> 09:20.894
Is everything all right?

09:21.520 --> 09:24.523
How's your night been, Mr. Bailiff?

09:25.607 --> 09:28.943
Fine. They're showing
<i>Barber of Seville</i> on TV.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.987
So I've just been here.

09:30.988 --> 09:33.365
Wonderful. And you're feeling well?

09:35.117 --> 09:37.953
Oh, God. What did I eat in there?

09:39.371 --> 09:42.124
We just need to know
if anything of note occurred.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.668
Anything at all.

09:46.879 --> 09:49.965
Why don't you tell me
what's going on, Mr. Milchick?

09:50.465 --> 09:52.300
<i>In the moment,
I thought I was being funny.</i>

09:52.301 --> 09:54.844
But in the hours since this outburst,

09:54.845 --> 09:58.389
I've been reminded
just how seriously my family's company

09:58.390 --> 10:00.767
affects the lives of real people
around the world.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.984
You know, your innie is a friend of mine.

10:10.152 --> 10:13.322
I feel confident
he'd approve of me saying so.

10:15.866 --> 10:18.535
And he's a man of principle,
which is rare.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.581
Which is what makes this so difficult.

10:25.792 --> 10:26.960
You're firing me?

10:28.170 --> 10:29.670
When Lumon falters,

10:29.671 --> 10:33.008
it's our cherished workers
and their families who suffer first.

10:34.092 --> 10:39.263
<i>So for the fear and insecurity
this has caused, I must sincerely atone.</i>

10:39.264 --> 10:41.349
You were involved
in a physical altercation

10:41.350 --> 10:43.267
with another employee this evening.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.520
It was brief but violent.

10:45.521 --> 10:47.772
And I regret to say
that you were the aggressor.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.190
- Wait--
- As such,

10:49.191 --> 10:52.693
I'm afraid we've no choice
but to terminate your employment,

10:52.694 --> 10:54.529
effective immediately.

10:54.530 --> 10:57.950
Distrust of Lumon
has been sadly endemic since its founding.

10:58.951 --> 11:03.037
My words provided more fuel
for a pernicious hate and derision.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.665
You can't just do that. What happened?

11:05.666 --> 11:10.044
Did I break something?
Or I can pay. I have cash upstairs.

11:10.045 --> 11:11.797
When I said my innie was being tortured...

11:14.591 --> 11:16.300
What am I supposed to tell my wife?

11:16.301 --> 11:19.220
This was a joke and a lie.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.305
I'm sorry.

11:25.018 --> 11:27.479
I'm committed to this company
with every part of me.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.323
<i>But I'm also human.</i>

11:41.743 --> 11:42.911
Just like my innie...

11:44.913 --> 11:46.123
<i>and just like you.</i>

13:19.049 --> 13:20.883
Well, that was more drama than I planned.

13:20.884 --> 13:21.968
I guess so.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.553
I'll let you know if we do
another reading.

13:23.554 --> 13:24.638
Yes, please do.

13:26.890 --> 13:30.643
And don't punish the baby, Ricken.
This wasn't its fault.

13:30.644 --> 13:33.438
Of course. Good night, Rebeck.

13:35.691 --> 13:37.191
I'm not the only one who heard you say it.

13:37.192 --> 13:39.402
- It's not like I made this up.
- Right. You know, I'm just--

13:39.403 --> 13:41.487
We can reschedule
the reading to next month. It's fine.

13:41.488 --> 13:43.114
I just have to decide
if I'm going to restart

13:43.115 --> 13:44.198
- with chapter 1.
- So what?

13:44.199 --> 13:46.034
So you said, "She's alive."

13:46.618 --> 13:49.328
- If I may--
- I'm trying to help you.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.624
If I may, I really did feel it was clear
you were referencing the baby.

13:53.208 --> 13:55.585
- Patton had just saved her.
- Well, he found her, yeah.

13:55.586 --> 13:57.880
And I think that your workie was excited.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.090
I have to say, Mark, he really is a jewel.

14:01.091 --> 14:05.136
Guys,
obviously I was referencing the baby.

14:05.137 --> 14:06.388
Yeah.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.682
- Okay?
- Yes.

14:09.683 --> 14:11.893
No. Yeah. I agre... I think Ricken is right.

14:11.894 --> 14:12.852
I agree.

14:12.853 --> 14:14.854
I... Babe, will you take her for a second?

14:14.855 --> 14:15.771
Yep.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.732
So let's Occam's razor this shit.

14:17.733 --> 14:19.692
You're looking for Eleanor,

14:19.693 --> 14:22.403
you find this picture,
which obviously is of interest to you,

14:22.404 --> 14:23.779
- so you pick it up.
- Right.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.990
And then when Patton found Eleanor--

14:25.991 --> 14:28.326
- Saved her, I'd still say.
- Okay, whatever, yes.

14:28.327 --> 14:31.537
- You still had it with you.
- Yeah.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.124
Yeah. I think it's the only thing
that makes sense.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.336
Okay. And Eleanor
was in the study because...

14:38.337 --> 14:40.588
Because Mrs. Selvig left her in there.

14:40.589 --> 14:41.839
- Or Cobel, whatever the fuck.
- Right.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.926
Perhaps "Cobelvig"
would be a helpful nomenclature.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.720
And assuming that "She's alive"
really was about the baby--

14:47.721 --> 14:49.514
I mean, you don't think it was?

14:49.515 --> 14:51.974
- I do think it was.
- Then why are you saying it like that?

14:51.975 --> 14:53.768
I don't... Sorry, I'm just exhausted.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.187
- It's been a weird fucking night, Mark.
- Oh, my God.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.313
Why are you getting aggressive

14:57.314 --> 14:58.689
- with me right now?
- Oh, my God! Th--

14:58.690 --> 15:00.942
- Okay, guys. Okay.
- Whatever.

15:00.943 --> 15:04.154
Let's deal with what we know to be true,
all right?

15:04.821 --> 15:09.826
Mark's workie went to great lengths
to awaken himself to alert us to abuses.

15:10.869 --> 15:12.204
He was inspired by my book.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.207
He found great meaning in it. Profundity.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.418
Goddamn it, Rebeck.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.171
- Honey, can-- Got her?
- Yeah.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.384
What the fuck are you even saying?

15:26.385 --> 15:28.803
Why are you being a dick to me?
I'm trying to help you.

15:28.804 --> 15:30.930
- I'm just trying to get--
- Good evening, Dr. Hale.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.684
- Good evening.
- Seth Milchick from Lumon.

15:34.309 --> 15:35.769
Is Mark Scout here by chance?

15:38.105 --> 15:39.523
Yes, he is.

15:41.275 --> 15:42.276
Come in.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.070
Thank you.

15:50.868 --> 15:51.952
Mr. Scout.

15:54.204 --> 15:55.998
I imagine you have a few questions.

15:57.749 --> 15:58.750
You could say that.

16:00.335 --> 16:01.336
May I sit with you?

16:03.881 --> 16:05.215
Right this way.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.096
You must be Devon.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.736
Okay. So...

16:26.737 --> 16:29.156
That is a magnificent helmet.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.284
Thank you.

16:34.620 --> 16:37.581
What happened tonight is what we call
the "overtime contingency."

16:38.081 --> 16:39.832
It's a safeguard we employ

16:39.833 --> 16:43.962
if we ever need to access
your work personage off company grounds.

16:44.505 --> 16:46.172
Yeah, you never told me about this.

16:46.173 --> 16:49.259
OTC disclosure can be found
in your start paperwork.

16:50.594 --> 16:54.639
It seems the tech was commandeered
by one of your office mates,

16:54.640 --> 16:58.101
allowing him to wake the rest of you
for a period of 39 minutes.

16:58.936 --> 17:02.064
Innie Mark was here in this house.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.276
I know. I talked to him.

17:08.654 --> 17:10.196
What did he say to you?

17:11.615 --> 17:13.908
If I tell you,
are you gonna punish him for it?

17:13.909 --> 17:16.035
We have no punishments at Lumon.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.538
Uh-huh.

17:20.249 --> 17:23.377
We're more concerned
about how you're doing, Mr. Scout.

17:24.752 --> 17:28.172
I can only imagine how violated
you feel by his actions.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.799
- Yes, speaking of violations...
- You--

17:29.800 --> 17:31.133
...just wondering how common it is

17:31.134 --> 17:33.344
for your managers to commit
fucking lactation fraud

17:33.345 --> 17:35.097
against their employees' families.

17:38.392 --> 17:39.518
Pretty common?

17:40.435 --> 17:41.477
Ms. Cobel.

17:41.478 --> 17:42.729
Yeah.

17:43.730 --> 17:49.235
What we learned tonight
is that she is quite severely unwell.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.696
Yeah. She lives next door to me.

17:51.697 --> 17:54.198
I, like, know her.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.825
And her behavior at Lumon

17:55.826 --> 17:58.078
seems to be the source
of your innie's distress.

18:00.247 --> 18:02.791
She will never descend
to that floor again.

18:03.792 --> 18:07.296
Nor bedevil you out here any further.

18:07.880 --> 18:08.881
You have my word.

18:12.259 --> 18:14.595
But we do need to know
what we're dealing with.

18:16.180 --> 18:20.184
Is there anything?
Anything you can tell me?

18:23.854 --> 18:24.980
I mean--

18:28.400 --> 18:31.235
No, I mean, we're very tired.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.820
Yes, we are.

18:32.821 --> 18:37.576
I think
we've just said all there is to say.

18:43.290 --> 18:47.002
Okay. Of course. I'll circle back.

18:49.379 --> 18:51.715
In the meantime, I hope to see you Monday.

18:52.591 --> 18:53.800
Yeah. I don't know, man.

18:59.473 --> 19:04.436
What your innie did tonight
was completely unauthorized.

19:05.896 --> 19:07.481
It was also very brave.

19:11.109 --> 19:13.612
I'd hate to reward his courage
with nonexistence.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.162
<i>You think we're about to meet our spouses?</i>

21:28.413 --> 21:29.248
<i>Maybe.</i>

21:29.873 --> 21:31.250
<i>Maybe it's each other.</i>

21:32.209 --> 21:33.210
<i>That'd be a hoot.</i>

21:34.044 --> 21:39.049
<i>Yeah, like,
mid-argument over car wash coupons.</i>

21:40.092 --> 21:41.802
<i>"Honey, you're cutting them wrong!"</i>

21:47.599 --> 21:48.600
- <i>Okay.</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

22:10.747 --> 22:11.874
In case we don't come back.

22:15.169 --> 22:17.421
<i>Or, I don't know, in case we do?</i>

22:45.782 --> 22:46.909
<i>In case we don't come back.</i>

22:47.701 --> 22:49.912
<i>Or, I don't know, in case we do?</i>

24:16.874 --> 24:17.708
You got this.

24:18.458 --> 24:21.044
No pressure. Be cool.

24:22.838 --> 24:25.299
You are so awesome. Smile.

24:39.855 --> 24:42.899
May I ask about benefits?

24:42.900 --> 24:44.484
There's a coffee maker.

24:45.944 --> 24:49.113
I meant health care benefits.

24:49.114 --> 24:51.533
Sure. Yes, of course.
For you. Your family.

24:52.284 --> 24:55.077
Okay, great. Yeah, you know,

24:55.078 --> 24:58.290
I think this is gonna be
a really great fit for me, Mr. Saliba.

24:58.916 --> 25:00.875
You know, ever since I was a kid,

25:00.876 --> 25:03.212
- I've always felt like doors had--
- How old?

25:03.712 --> 25:04.713
Sorry?

25:05.589 --> 25:07.841
How old were you
when you knew you loved doors?

25:10.928 --> 25:11.762
Five.

25:14.306 --> 25:16.808
If you could be any kind of door,
what would it be?

25:21.605 --> 25:22.773
Pocket.

25:23.357 --> 25:25.776
- Interesting. Tell me more.
- Yes.

25:27.861 --> 25:32.658
Well, you're, you know,
doing your door thing and then

25:33.534 --> 25:35.034
when you're not needed, you can just--

25:35.035 --> 25:36.787
Just tuck yourself away.

25:39.122 --> 25:40.374
Flat finish or eggshell?

25:43.293 --> 25:44.294
Semi-gloss.

25:46.421 --> 25:47.256
That's hot.

25:50.092 --> 25:51.343
You remind me of me, Dylan.

25:53.428 --> 25:54.471
You like kickball?

25:56.765 --> 26:01.978
As a skill? Or, like,
do I follow it professionally? I--

26:01.979 --> 26:03.312
Yeah.

26:03.313 --> 26:05.899
We play on Fridays.
There's a fun prize if you win.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.360
You mean a door prize.

26:15.492 --> 26:16.325
Sorry.

26:16.326 --> 26:20.372
A lot of short-term employment.
And then Lumon.

26:20.914 --> 26:23.124
- Yes.
- And they make their doors in-house.

26:23.125 --> 26:24.459
It's fucking hubris.

26:28.589 --> 26:29.423
Yeah.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.134
I was a severed employee, so...

26:35.470 --> 26:36.471
You're a severed?

26:38.223 --> 26:41.142
Yes. Yeah, I was. But you know,

26:41.143 --> 26:42.895
it's just me here and...

26:45.272 --> 26:47.273
Well, Mr. George, thanks for coming in.

26:47.274 --> 26:48.608
What?

26:48.609 --> 26:50.652
We'll consider
your application thoroughly.

26:51.445 --> 26:53.946
That's it? Just because I'm severed?

26:53.947 --> 26:56.699
Like I said, we'll consider
your application thoroughly.

26:56.700 --> 26:58.784
Okay. You're not considering me at all.
That's discrimination.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.953
We need a certain kind of person here,
Mr. George,

27:00.954 --> 27:02.663
not a certain kind of two people.

27:02.664 --> 27:04.081
What do you think this is?
A carpet factory?

27:04.082 --> 27:06.125
- What?
- You want to circumcise your brain,

27:06.126 --> 27:07.335
that's your business.

27:07.336 --> 27:12.424
But it doesn't mean I have to hire you.
And personally, I think it's abhorrent.

27:35.239 --> 27:36.656
Read the room.

27:36.657 --> 27:38.950
I would have picked up the phone
if it was good news.

27:38.951 --> 27:42.662
<i>I'm sorry. You'll get the next one.</i>

27:42.663 --> 27:43.914
Stop being nice.

27:50.629 --> 27:54.383
Hey, do we need more baby wipeys?

27:54.925 --> 27:56.008
<i>I don't think so.</i>

27:56.009 --> 27:59.637
You know what? I'll get some anyway.
I'll be home soon.

27:59.638 --> 28:01.223
<i>Okay. Bye, hon.</i>

28:09.898 --> 28:11.441
<i>So, he's your boss?</i>

28:12.067 --> 28:14.528
And what about "Cobelvig"?
Have you heard from her?

28:15.237 --> 28:17.697
I went by there.
No one answered the door though.

28:17.698 --> 28:20.700
Fuck. Well, I was just thinking,

28:20.701 --> 28:24.037
maybe there was a way we could confirm
what your innie meant.

28:25.831 --> 28:27.707
Devon. Jesus Christ. Are you serious?

28:27.708 --> 28:29.667
I know we're not supposed to contact him

28:29.668 --> 28:31.335
but Danise is a lawyer and apparently,

28:31.336 --> 28:33.088
- you can petition--
- I'm quitting.

28:34.965 --> 28:36.175
- You're quitting?
- Yeah.

28:38.510 --> 28:42.514
Okay. Have you called them already?

28:43.098 --> 28:45.017
No, I was gonna do it tonight.

28:45.809 --> 28:46.810
Uh-huh.

28:47.936 --> 28:48.937
I'm sorry.

28:49.688 --> 28:52.356
Haven't you been trying to get me
to quit that place since I got there?

28:52.357 --> 28:54.650
I thought
I was finally doing what you want.

28:54.651 --> 28:58.155
No. Yes, but don't you think
that was strange last night?

28:58.780 --> 29:01.115
I mean, why was he so curious?

29:01.116 --> 29:06.120
Devon, what are you doing?
You remember I identified her, right?

29:06.121 --> 29:08.122
- Yes, Mark.
- I saw her body.

29:08.123 --> 29:09.208
Yeah, I know.

29:11.210 --> 29:15.046
My thing is, if we could just get, like,
a half-step more confirmation,

29:15.047 --> 29:18.674
then it's not gonna be something
that continues to haunt us.

29:18.675 --> 29:20.176
- Do you know what I mean?
- Us?

29:20.177 --> 29:23.137
Yes. She was my family too, Mark. Fuck.

29:23.138 --> 29:25.515
Yeah. But she was my wife.

29:25.516 --> 29:27.975
I know, but you're not the only one
her death affected.

29:27.976 --> 29:29.393
- Oh, really? It affected you?
- Yes.

29:29.394 --> 29:32.397
Did you have to tell her parents
that she was dead?

29:33.232 --> 29:34.398
How about her students?

29:34.399 --> 29:35.483
How about this.

29:35.484 --> 29:39.863
Did your sheets smell like her
for weeks afterwards?

29:42.491 --> 29:46.702
You know what? Honestly,
if Ricken died and his body burned,

29:46.703 --> 29:48.704
- I'd be sad for you.
- Wow.

29:48.705 --> 29:50.207
But I wouldn't be affected.

29:51.124 --> 29:52.208
This is obscene.

29:52.209 --> 29:53.417
I just want to be sure.

29:53.418 --> 29:55.045
I am sure!

30:03.178 --> 30:04.680
- I'll talk to you later.
- Mark.

30:06.723 --> 30:07.724
Mark.

31:24.593 --> 31:25.843
Okay.

31:25.844 --> 31:27.596
You're not picking up. I get it.

31:28.096 --> 31:30.891
I want you to know
my innie got the message.

32:27.197 --> 32:28.240
Mr. Milchick?

32:30.492 --> 32:32.202
Compliments of the company.

32:34.705 --> 32:36.707
We got off on the wrong foot last night.

32:37.541 --> 32:38.792
Okay to talk a minute?

32:41.712 --> 32:43.505
Yeah. Come on in.

32:45.424 --> 32:46.425
Thank you.

32:53.140 --> 32:57.519
So, Mr. Scout, I know you're still
weighing whether to return to Lumon.

32:58.812 --> 32:59.646
Yeah.

33:00.606 --> 33:03.734
I'd like to ask you a few questions
that may inform your decision.

33:04.693 --> 33:05.986
Is that all right?

33:08.030 --> 33:08.863
Okay.

33:08.864 --> 33:10.282
Terrific.

33:11.158 --> 33:15.537
First, how happy are you
with your current financial compensation?

33:17.539 --> 33:22.210
I ask because our endearment to you
is such that a 20% bump is on the table,

33:22.211 --> 33:23.337
should you return.

33:25.714 --> 33:28.508
20%. Wow.

33:28.509 --> 33:33.095
My second question is whether a full
investigation into your innie's claims,

33:33.096 --> 33:36.224
and regular wellness checks
from independent orgs,

33:36.225 --> 33:39.019
would help you
feel more excited to return?

33:39.770 --> 33:42.271
Well, I don't know.
Is that what they're doing?

33:42.272 --> 33:43.899
It's the first step of many.

33:48.320 --> 33:52.241
My third question
concerns your late wife, Gemma.

33:57.204 --> 33:58.205
What about her?

33:59.498 --> 34:00.706
In your intake interview,

34:00.707 --> 34:04.169
you cited her death
as a primary motivator for severing.

34:06.296 --> 34:07.714
Do you remember what you said?

34:09.466 --> 34:10.467
No.

34:11.385 --> 34:14.847
You said since she died,
every day feels like a year.

34:17.014 --> 34:19.643
That you felt like
you were choking on her ghost.

34:21.520 --> 34:23.397
Do you still feel that way, Mr. Scout?

34:33.031 --> 34:35.742
The Mark I've come to know
at Lumon is happy.

34:37.286 --> 34:40.746
He cares for people and he's funny.

34:43.500 --> 34:45.918
He knows nothing of the pain
I see in you right now.

34:51.842 --> 34:52.842
He's found love.

34:53.760 --> 34:54.761
Love?

34:57.014 --> 34:58.222
With who?

34:58.223 --> 35:03.145
The solace you have given him down there
will make its way to you.

35:04.771 --> 35:05.939
It just takes time.

35:08.233 --> 35:12.154
I hope you'll give us that time,
Mr. Scout.

36:14.842 --> 36:16.218
Are you satisfied with this?

36:17.719 --> 36:20.138
The sister seems more uppity than he is.

36:22.182 --> 36:23.892
So, who are you bringing into MDR?

36:24.518 --> 36:29.064
I've got a floater from overseas
and a pair who were laid off from 5X.

36:29.690 --> 36:30.691
5X?

36:32.401 --> 36:33.402
Really?

36:35.153 --> 36:38.031
<i>I had 48 hours to pull this together.</i>

36:38.907 --> 36:40.659
<i>Hopefully there will be some chemistry.</i>

36:45.581 --> 36:47.332
<i>We don't need chemistry.</i>

36:48.834 --> 36:50.459
<i>We need Mark S. back to work.</i>

36:50.460 --> 36:51.545
Go on ahead.

36:52.296 --> 36:54.298
Long enough to complete Cold Harbor.

36:56.049 --> 36:57.426
- See you tonight.
- All right.

37:03.891 --> 37:05.642
- Good night, Mr. Scout.
- Good night, Judd.

37:06.143 --> 37:07.602
Good morning, Mr. Scout.

37:07.603 --> 37:08.770
Morning, Judd.

37:09.646 --> 37:11.607
- Good night, Mr. Scout.
- Night, Judd.

37:14.818 --> 37:16.235
Good morning, Mr. Scout.

37:16.236 --> 37:17.529
Good morning, Judd.

37:42.095 --> 37:43.847
- Mr. Scout.
- Good night, Judd.

37:49.811 --> 37:51.854
<i>Hello? Is anyone there? Is the Board on?</i>

37:51.855 --> 37:54.358
<i>It's Mark S. from Macrodata Refinement.</i>

37:56.318 --> 37:58.736
<i>Okay. Well, if you're there,
please listen.</i>

37:58.737 --> 38:02.198
<i>Now, I know that you want to
do the right thing for severed people,</i>

38:02.199 --> 38:05.451
- <i>which is why I need to see my team again.</i>
- <i>Mark!</i>

38:05.452 --> 38:08.287
<i>If we truly are the face
of severance reform, as you say,</i>

38:08.288 --> 38:11.415
- <i>then they deserve a chance.</i>
- <i>Mark!</i>

38:11.416 --> 38:14.628
<i>Please. They're my friends!
You can't just make them disappear!</i>

38:19.883 --> 38:21.885
Of course, I bear full responsibility.

38:22.761 --> 38:24.763
The Board's gonna give him what he wants,

38:25.973 --> 38:27.641
including Helly R.

38:29.726 --> 38:31.353
He won't finish without them.

38:47.786 --> 38:48.787
Mr. Milchick?

38:51.290 --> 38:52.416
Mr. George.

39:16.815 --> 39:18.441
This is unheard of.

39:18.442 --> 39:20.234
- I'm sorry, Mr. Wilkins.
- Three days of work.

39:20.235 --> 39:22.612
I broke a fucking lease in Grand Rapids.

39:22.613 --> 39:23.946
Fucking touch me.

39:23.947 --> 39:25.574
Give me another reason to sue.

39:26.783 --> 39:28.368
Fuck you, Lumon!

39:33.081 --> 39:33.916
Hey, Judd.

40:59.668 --> 41:00.669
Morning, Judd.

42:17.621 --> 42:18.622
Hey!

42:22.793 --> 42:26.088
Hello, Mark. Just back from work?

42:29.675 --> 42:31.301
Where do you think you're going?

42:32.594 --> 42:33.762
What do you care?

42:35.764 --> 42:37.140
What do I care?

42:38.475 --> 42:39.476
What do I c--

42:41.353 --> 42:42.354
Who are you?

42:43.522 --> 42:45.482
I thought you were quitting.

42:46.024 --> 42:47.234
I trusted you.

42:48.652 --> 42:52.155
I told you what I'd gone through
these past two years.

42:53.448 --> 42:54.449
You...

42:59.079 --> 43:00.747
You were in my house. You...

43:02.583 --> 43:04.918
I ate your shitty fucking cookies.

43:07.629 --> 43:09.339
They convinced you to stay?

43:11.800 --> 43:13.594
Was a pineapple involved?

43:17.598 --> 43:19.183
You're so easy to sway.

43:22.394 --> 43:25.063
What? So that's it? You're just...
You're leaving?

43:26.690 --> 43:28.150
Are you fucking kid--

43:37.451 --> 43:41.955
Why did you do this?
What the fuck is this all about?

44:01.600 --> 44:03.852
Do you know something about Gemma?
