Hey there.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.783
-Quick! Hold it, Robin!
-I got it.

[Nancy] Robin, get it off me!

00:55.305 --> 00:56.556
Got it, got it, got it!

00:56.639 --> 00:58.099
God damn it! Shit!

00:59.517 --> 01:00.435
[Robin] Let go!

-[gasps]
-Well, they took about a pound of flesh.

01:48.399 --> 01:49.734
But other than that,

01:50.318 --> 01:51.528
yeah, never better.

01:53.154 --> 01:55.865
Uh, do you guys think
these bats have, like, rabies?

01:55.949 --> 01:58.701
-What?
-It's just that rabies are, like,

01:58.785 --> 02:00.328
my number one greatest fear.

02:00.411 --> 02:02.664
And I think we should
get you to a doctor soon

02:02.747 --> 02:05.291
because once symptoms set in,
it's too late. You're already dead.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.144
All right. There's not that many.

02:26.729 --> 02:27.730
We can take 'em.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.149
Right?

02:29.649 --> 02:32.193
[swarm chittering]

02:33.778 --> 02:35.280
You were saying?

[menacing industrial synth music playing]

02:39.742 --> 02:41.161
The woods. Come on.

Great.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.302
[wheezing for breath]

04:21.386 --> 04:22.387
Have you

04:23.012 --> 04:24.806
reconsidered your position?

04:26.474 --> 04:28.393
-Where's the girl?
-[breathing shakily]

04:32.730 --> 04:34.565

04:37.986 --> 04:39.237
[soldier] Let's go.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.656
No, wait, wait. Please. Wait!

04:46.744 --> 04:47.745
Please.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.336
Just don't kill her.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.840
Promise me you won't kill her.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.527
[gasping]

05:27.577 --> 05:31.080
We're running out of time here, Martin.
Hawkins is running out of time.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.708
I understand the stakes quite well.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.836
Sometimes I wonder if you really do.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.755
Or maybe you've just done all this

05:38.838 --> 05:40.965
'cause you missed
your daddy-daughter time.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.635
I've given you everything you asked for.

05:44.719 --> 05:48.723
I've compromised my principles.
I've risked my life, my family's life.

05:49.223 --> 05:51.851
All because you assured me
this would work,

05:51.934 --> 05:53.478
that this was the only way.

05:53.561 --> 05:56.147
But I don't see
any progress out there, Martin.

05:56.856 --> 05:57.899
You know what I see?

05:57.982 --> 06:00.777
I see a frightened,
traumatized little girl.

06:02.862 --> 06:03.863
Good for us.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.162
[door closes]

06:16.042 --> 06:19.045
[Brenner] The truth is,
you're regressing, Eleven.

06:19.962 --> 06:21.422
You're going backwards.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.133
Eleven, look at me.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.395
Look at me.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.358
I know you're frightened.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.736
You're terribly frightened
by what you've seen.

06:44.362 --> 06:47.156
But it's this very fear
that's now holding you back.

06:48.574 --> 06:51.244
If you want Nina to succeed,

06:51.953 --> 06:56.541
you cannot hide from the truth,
no matter how frightening it may be.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.420
I saw what I did.

07:03.339 --> 07:05.049
I am a monster.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.928
You speak of monsters,

07:09.011 --> 07:10.346
superheroes.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.517
That's the stuff of myth and fairy tales.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.728
Reality, truth, is rarely so simple.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.773
People are not so easily defined.

07:21.649 --> 07:25.236
Only by facing all of ourselves,
the good and the bad,

07:25.945 --> 07:27.447
can we become whole.

07:29.323 --> 07:31.409
What if I don't wanna become whole?

07:32.618 --> 07:34.036
Then that is a choice.

07:35.538 --> 07:36.581
Your choice.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.959
The door is always open.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.211
This place

07:43.087 --> 07:44.255
is not a prison.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.259
This is.

07:52.221 --> 07:54.348
You chose to trust me once.

07:55.516 --> 07:57.727
I'm asking you to trust me again.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.398
Journey with me into the past
one last time.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.694
Stop hiding, Eleven.

[mysterious synth music playing]

09:21.811 --> 09:23.813
[machinery whirring]

09:24.647 --> 09:26.023
How much time did you skip?

09:28.025 --> 09:29.277
You wanted progress.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.238
I'm giving it to you.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.623
[screaming]

09:46.377 --> 09:49.088
[Powell] What exactly
were you all doing at the lake?

09:51.674 --> 09:52.842
[Dustin] Uh…

09:52.925 --> 09:55.636
-It's comp--
-We were… We were just going for a walk.

09:55.720 --> 09:56.637
[Callahan] A walk?

09:56.721 --> 09:58.681
At 9:00 p.m.?

09:58.764 --> 09:59.849
[squeakily] To the lake.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.101
We were gonna

10:03.060 --> 10:04.437
take a little swim.

10:07.857 --> 10:08.858
Little night swim.

10:09.358 --> 10:10.860
[Mrs. Henderson] Dusty.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.987
Someone was just murdered there.

10:13.070 --> 10:16.324
Yeah, we… we didn't realize that
until we got there.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.658
That's why we didn't swim.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.161
And Nancy,
was she with you at this night swim?

10:20.244 --> 10:21.162
-No.
-Yes. Uh…

10:23.039 --> 10:24.040
We're not sure.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.708
[Dustin] She was there.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.461
Then she left.

10:28.544 --> 10:31.422
-It's all a little confusing.
-That's when you guys came.

10:31.505 --> 10:33.924
Right. Then they dared me
to say what I said.

10:34.008 --> 10:34.967
Oh, yeah.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.552
-About the killer.
-[laughing]

10:36.636 --> 10:38.095
You're lucky you didn't get shot.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.473
Have you had any contact with Eddie?

10:40.556 --> 10:43.851
That psycho… freak killer?

10:43.934 --> 10:45.144
God, no.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.897
-Nope. Absolutely not.
-No. We haven't heard from him.

10:47.980 --> 10:49.315
-We barely know the guy.
-Who?

10:49.398 --> 10:50.900
Oh, that's a bunch of bull.

10:50.983 --> 10:53.486
-[both] Erica!
-I mean, you realize they're lying.

10:53.569 --> 10:54.945
The whole couch is on fire.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.989
-[both] Erica.
-Just the facts.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.867
Are you lying to these policemen, Dusty?

10:59.950 --> 11:02.578
-[high-pitched] No.
-Lying to cops is a crime, son.

11:02.662 --> 11:05.748
-I'm not lying.
-The fire is consuming us.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.959
Threaten them with a little jail time.
Maybe that'll loosen their lips.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.003
-Okay--
-You wanna send our kids to jail?

11:11.087 --> 11:13.923
-We need to take this seriously.
-He didn't mean it like that.

11:14.006 --> 11:16.717
[overlapping arguments]

11:18.469 --> 11:20.221
-Shut up!
-Oh my God.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.891
[yelling] Shut up!

11:24.558 --> 11:25.726
-Jesus.
-Shh.

11:25.810 --> 11:29.105
We're gonna try a more civilized approach.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.440
One at a time.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.276
You first.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.654
-Wait, what? Why me?
-Follow me.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.406
I'm not even in Hellfire.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.907
Do I need to cuff you?

11:41.450 --> 11:42.284
Up.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.286
Chop-chop.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.329
Let's go.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.458
[mysterious music playing]

11:49.542 --> 11:50.793
[creatures chittering]

12:22.032 --> 12:24.118
Oh… okay.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.288
-That was close.
-Yeah.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.497
[Eddie] Too close.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.001
Oh, sh… shit.

12:32.084 --> 12:33.043
Steve?

12:33.127 --> 12:35.254
-Jesus.
-I'm fine. I'm fine.

12:35.337 --> 12:37.673
No, no, no.
You're not. You're losing blood.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.133
Come on, sit. All right?

12:39.216 --> 12:40.342
[grunts]

12:40.426 --> 12:41.469
[Nancy] All right.

12:43.304 --> 12:45.264
-[music pulses ominously]
-Oh…

12:45.848 --> 12:46.766
[Steve grunting]

12:48.851 --> 12:49.810
Okay.

12:49.894 --> 12:53.814
So the good news is I'm pretty sure
wooziness is not a symptom of rabies.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.609
But if you start having hallucinations
or muscle spasms

12:56.692 --> 13:00.154
or you start feeling aggressive,
like you wanna punch me, let me know.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.572
-Robin.
-Yeah?

13:01.655 --> 13:02.948
I kinda wanna punch you.

13:03.032 --> 13:06.160
[laughs] Sense of humor's still intact.
That's a good sign.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.119
Yeah.

13:09.997 --> 13:11.624
-Okay.
-[Steve grunts]

13:12.166 --> 13:13.042
Okay.

13:13.584 --> 13:14.460
-You ready?
-Yeah.

13:14.543 --> 13:15.711
Just do it.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.837
[wet squelch]

13:16.921 --> 13:17.963
[stifled groan]

13:18.589 --> 13:19.548
Sorry.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.466
It's okay.

13:23.719 --> 13:24.970
-[grunts]
-Too tight?

13:25.054 --> 13:26.806
-No, that's good.
-All right.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.184
[grunting, panting]

13:30.267 --> 13:31.185
Okay.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.446
Thanks.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.031
Yeah.

13:49.328 --> 13:50.955
[thunder rumbling]

14:00.381 --> 14:01.298
[Eddie] So, uh,

14:02.299 --> 14:06.762
this place is like Hawkins,
but with monsters and nasty shit?

14:06.846 --> 14:07.847
Pretty much.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.642
Wait, watch out for the vines.

14:11.725 --> 14:12.935
It's all a hive mind.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.353
It's all a what?

14:14.436 --> 14:16.480
All the creepy crawlies around here.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.232
They're, like, one or something.

14:18.315 --> 14:21.527
Step on a vine, you're stepping on a bat,
you're stepping on Vecna.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.070
Shit.

14:24.238 --> 14:27.741
But everything from our world
is still here, right? Except people?

14:27.825 --> 14:29.159
As far as I understand it, yeah.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.996
So, theoretically,
we could go to the police station

14:32.079 --> 14:34.540
and steal guns and grenades
and whatever we need

14:34.623 --> 14:36.750
to blow up those bat things
that are guarding the gate.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.920
I highly doubt
the Hawkins PD has grenades, Robin.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.922
But guns, yeah, sure.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.758
Well, we don't have to go
all the way downtown for guns.

14:45.551 --> 14:47.553
I have guns in my bedroom.

14:48.387 --> 14:49.513
You,

14:49.597 --> 14:51.098
Nancy Wheeler,

14:51.181 --> 14:52.516
have guns, plural,

14:53.058 --> 14:54.310
in your bedroom?

14:54.393 --> 14:55.895
Full of surprises, isn't she?

14:55.978 --> 14:58.147
A Russian Makarov and a revolver.

14:58.230 --> 15:00.190
Yeah, you almost shot me with that one.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.443
You almost deserved it.

15:05.738 --> 15:06.947
For your modesty, dude.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.158
[loud rumbling]

15:11.869 --> 15:12.953
[Robin] Oh my god!

15:16.540 --> 15:18.584
[all panting]

15:22.379 --> 15:24.298
[creature baying in distance]

15:26.884 --> 15:29.637
[creatures snarling]

15:37.102 --> 15:39.229
So guns seem like
a pretty good idea to me.

15:39.313 --> 15:40.189
Yeah, me too.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.695
So what are we waiting for?

15:46.779 --> 15:48.781
[ominous music playing]

16:00.626 --> 16:02.544
[dark, industrial synth music playing]

16:35.119 --> 16:37.287
[music trails off]

16:40.541 --> 16:41.792
You know,

16:41.875 --> 16:44.628
what we are to attempt is quite mad.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.589
Even by your standards, American.

16:48.298 --> 16:49.174
Yeah?

16:51.343 --> 16:53.137
You got odds for us this time?

16:53.637 --> 16:54.638
[scoffs]

16:58.017 --> 16:59.059
I think…

17:02.229 --> 17:03.397
a thousand to one?

17:03.480 --> 17:04.481
[chuckles]

17:05.607 --> 17:08.777
Even if we somehow kill this beast,
we still must escape.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.404
We fail there,

17:10.487 --> 17:13.490
I don't think they will be so kind
as to throw us back in a cell.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.451
They will shoot us on sight.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.911
We'd die as monster slayers.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.663
You'll be a legend.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.834
But still a traitor. You forgot traitor.

17:23.917 --> 17:25.627
Monster slayer trumps traitor.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.133
I bet Mikhail
will be proud of his pops, at least.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.217
Mikhail?

17:32.301 --> 17:33.385
-Mmm.
-No.

17:34.553 --> 17:37.598
I can't do nothing right
with him anymore, it seems.

17:37.681 --> 17:38.682
He will say,

17:38.766 --> 17:42.644
"Papa, I bet that bald American
did most of the monster slaying."

17:44.104 --> 17:45.397
He's that age, huh?

17:45.481 --> 17:47.483
-Yeah, he is that age.
-[Hopper chuckles]

17:49.359 --> 17:50.903
It is same for you, American?

17:51.445 --> 17:52.613
With your new daughter?

17:53.739 --> 17:58.494
The last time I was with El, she wanted
just about nothing to do with me.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.370
I was just in her way, really.

18:01.038 --> 18:04.500
I think back to the way I was with my dad
at that age. I was the same way.

18:05.542 --> 18:06.752
The exact same way.

18:08.378 --> 18:10.380
[emotional music playing]

18:11.006 --> 18:14.134
I think it must be hardwired into us
to reject our fathers.

18:15.636 --> 18:17.346
So we can grow and move on.

18:19.306 --> 18:20.891
Become something of our own.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.813
I hope that's what she's doing.

18:28.190 --> 18:29.399
Coming into her own.

18:32.653 --> 18:33.570
But still--

18:33.654 --> 18:35.072
You worry.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.742
To worry for our sons and daughters,

18:38.826 --> 18:40.577
that is natural, isn't it?

18:41.161 --> 18:41.995
Yeah.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.083
But nothing about what El
has had to deal with is natural.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.335
[jarring musical stinger]

18:48.418 --> 18:49.503
That beast,

18:50.712 --> 18:52.339
that monster in there,

18:52.422 --> 18:56.426
it's a part of something
that wants to hurt El. To kill her.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.137
I don't understand.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.556
To be honest, neither do I.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.976
All I know is that thing…

19:04.059 --> 19:06.645
that thing shouldn't be here.
It shouldn't be alive.

19:08.021 --> 19:10.566
Because it is,
it means it still isn't over.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.028
I thought I was put here

19:15.863 --> 19:17.531
to pay for what I've done.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.869
But I might've been put here
for some other reason.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.495
Maybe I…

19:25.205 --> 19:26.748
maybe I can still help El.

19:28.125 --> 19:29.793
Even if it's the last thing I do.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.589
You almost sound religious, American.

19:33.672 --> 19:35.799
Religious? I don't know about that.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.721
But maybe I should
give that prayer thing a try.

19:41.889 --> 19:45.100
'Cause if we wanna get out of here,
get back to El and Mikhail,

19:45.184 --> 19:46.143
you and me…

19:48.729 --> 19:50.189
we're gonna need a miracle.

[indistinct radio chatter]

20:21.178 --> 20:22.971
Can I help you, comrade?

20:23.430 --> 20:24.932
My name is Yuri Ismaylov.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.523
[in English] Hello.

20:33.607 --> 20:34.483
[laughs]

20:34.858 --> 20:36.777
[in Russian] The warden is expecting me.

20:36.860 --> 20:39.071
I have a very special delivery for him.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.240
A rare import from America.

20:41.698 --> 20:42.908
[laughs wheezily]

[Yuri speaking, muffled]

21:00.050 --> 21:01.760
[in English] Okay, okay. I'm okay.

[mysterious music playing]

21:59.609 --> 22:01.737
[Brenner] Try your best not to blink.

22:12.664 --> 22:13.874
Any more headaches?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.251
Nausea this morning?

22:19.463 --> 22:20.797
How about your memory?

22:21.840 --> 22:23.925
Can you remember what happened now?

22:28.138 --> 22:31.683
Perhaps someone else
can help fill in the gaps.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.144
Yes?

22:36.730 --> 22:39.066
[tense music playing]

22:46.823 --> 22:48.200
[Brenner] Good morning, children.

22:48.283 --> 22:49.993
[children] Good morning, Papa.

22:50.577 --> 22:53.205
[Brenner] Today's lesson
is going to be about rules.

22:54.247 --> 22:55.832
Ah, for some of you,

22:55.916 --> 22:58.126
this may seem redundant.

22:59.252 --> 23:01.797
For others,
it appears a refresher is required.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.091
Eleven, please step forward. 

23:07.969 --> 23:12.099
Last night, your sister Eleven
suffered a concussion

23:12.182 --> 23:14.559
during her alone time in the rainbow room.

23:15.185 --> 23:17.854
Now, she claims to not have
a memory of what happened.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.483
But injuries of this nature
don't simply happen.

23:22.192 --> 23:23.860
Someone did this.

23:25.695 --> 23:27.864
Someone in this room.

23:28.865 --> 23:29.866
Now,

23:30.617 --> 23:32.577
who's going to tell me what happened?

23:33.954 --> 23:36.623
[uneasy music playing]

23:39.709 --> 23:42.003
[Two] She must've… fallen.

23:45.006 --> 23:45.841
Fallen?

23:47.467 --> 23:48.885
You've seen her, Papa.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.971
She's clumsy.

23:51.972 --> 23:52.806
Stupid.

23:53.306 --> 23:54.307
[bullies snickering]

23:58.228 --> 23:59.604
Eleven, you may step back.

24:01.314 --> 24:03.024
Number Two, please step forward.

24:08.530 --> 24:09.865
[Brenner] Collar him.

[collar clinks]

24:20.959 --> 24:22.085
[collar clasps shut]

24:26.715 --> 24:27.591
Thank you.

24:34.431 --> 24:37.934
You think because
you demonstrate some talent

24:38.018 --> 24:41.688
that you're somehow immune
to the rules, is that it?

24:42.689 --> 24:44.024
No, Papa.

24:44.107 --> 24:46.651
That the rules don't apply to you
in the same way

24:46.735 --> 24:48.945
that they apply
to your brothers and sisters?

24:49.029 --> 24:50.363
No, Papa.

24:50.447 --> 24:52.949
Then why did you attack Eleven?

24:53.533 --> 24:56.786
-Did she tell you that?
-Are you asking the questions or am I?

24:56.870 --> 24:58.663
Did you attack Eleven?

24:58.747 --> 25:01.500

then… then she's lying.

[intense synth music playing]

25:16.389 --> 25:17.307
Now,

25:17.849 --> 25:19.059
shall we try again?

25:20.769 --> 25:22.479
[remote clicking]

25:24.314 --> 25:25.774
What happened?

25:25.857 --> 25:27.108

[Robin] Couldn't we have tried a road,
or something just slightly less creepy?

25:49.506 --> 25:53.218
[Nancy] I think we're getting close.
We're almost out of here. Don't worry.

[Steve] Eddie.

25:55.762 --> 25:57.681
Eddie. Hey, man. Uh…

25:58.515 --> 25:59.558
Listen, I just, uh…

26:00.600 --> 26:02.143
I just want to say thanks.

26:04.104 --> 26:05.647
For saving my ass back there.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.941
Shit. You saved your own ass, man.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.486
I mean, that was a real Ozzy move
you pulled back there.

26:12.529 --> 26:13.572
Ozzy?

26:13.655 --> 26:15.532
When you took a bite out of that bat.

26:16.825 --> 26:17.784
Ozzy Osbourne?

Black Sabbath?

-He bit a bat's head off onstage.
-I don't--

26:24.040 --> 26:25.542
-You know? Doesn't matter.
-No.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.253
It's very metal, what you did.
That's all I'm saying.

26:29.588 --> 26:30.505
Thanks.

26:31.631 --> 26:36.052
Henderson told me you were a badass.
Insisted on the matter, in fact.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.971
-Henderson said that?
-Oh yeah. Shit.

26:38.054 --> 26:39.389
Kid worships you, dude.

26:39.472 --> 26:44.144
Like, you have no idea.
It's kinda annoying, to be honest.

26:45.061 --> 26:48.648
I don't even know why I care
what that little shrimp thinks,

26:48.732 --> 26:51.860
but, uh, guess I got
a little jealous, Steve.

26:54.988 --> 26:58.825
I guess I couldn't accept the fact
that Steve Harrington

26:58.908 --> 27:00.201
was actually

27:01.578 --> 27:02.495
a good dude.

27:03.413 --> 27:06.374
Rich parents, popular, chicks love him.
Not a douche?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.918
No way, man. No way. That, like,

27:09.002 --> 27:11.671
flies in the face
of all the laws in the universe

27:11.755 --> 27:14.799
and my own personal Munson doctrine.

27:17.844 --> 27:20.096
Still super jealous as hell, by the way.

27:20.180 --> 27:23.308
Which is why I would never have
jumped in that lake to save your ass.

27:23.391 --> 27:27.771
Not under any, uh… normal circumstances.

Nope.

27:34.778 --> 27:38.156
Outside of D&amp;D, I am no hero.

27:39.240 --> 27:43.286
I see danger and I just turn heel and run.

27:43.953 --> 27:46.998
Or at least that's what
I've learned about myself this week.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.750
-Give yourself a break, man.
-See?

27:49.876 --> 27:52.921
The only reason I came in here
was 'cause those ladies

27:53.004 --> 27:54.381
came in straight after you.

27:54.964 --> 27:57.676
Now, I was too ashamed
to be the one who stayed behind.

27:58.259 --> 27:59.803
But Wheeler right there,

27:59.886 --> 28:01.554
she didn't waste a second.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.891
Not one second.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.976
She just dove right in.

28:08.186 --> 28:11.981
Now, I don't know what happened
between you two,

28:12.065 --> 28:13.358
but if I were you,

28:14.776 --> 28:16.736
I would get her back.

28:16.820 --> 28:17.946
'Cause that

28:18.571 --> 28:22.701
was as unambiguous a sign of true love

This is Dustin. Where are you?

29:31.186 --> 29:34.856
We've been collared by the law.
I repeat, we've been collared by the law.

Do you copy?

nobody did anything wrong.

But what if they did do something wrong?

29:50.580 --> 29:51.998
-Anything?
-Nothing.

-You don't think they went through…
-Through Watergate?

29:57.003 --> 29:59.339
Without us? Without a plan?
Without weapons?

29:59.881 --> 30:01.216
They wouldn't be that stupid.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.467
Yeah.

'cause the law got us.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.434
Should I round up the posse?

30:11.518 --> 30:13.186
-Saddle the horses?
-Erica.

30:13.269 --> 30:15.688
Please, just go away.

30:15.772 --> 30:16.940
Here's the deal.

30:17.023 --> 30:19.776
Either you tell me what's happening

30:19.859 --> 30:22.654
or I tell Dustin
what I found under your bed.

30:25.156 --> 30:25.990
Please, no.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.159
Spill your guts, cowpuncher.

30:28.243 --> 30:30.078
-What'd she find?
-Nothing.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.454
Is it gross?

30:31.538 --> 30:32.956
-Scale of one to ten.
-A hundred.

30:33.039 --> 30:34.082
A hundred?

30:34.165 --> 30:36.918
The serial killer is a dark wizard
from the Upside Down.

30:37.001 --> 30:38.419
And we've been looking for him,

30:38.503 --> 30:40.505
but he's in the Upside Down,
which we can't reach.

30:40.588 --> 30:42.215
At least we thought we couldn't,

30:42.298 --> 30:44.551
until we found a gate at Lover's Lake.

30:44.634 --> 30:48.096
That was the reason why we were there,
but these stupid cops grabbed us.

30:48.179 --> 30:50.974
And if you tell anyone about this,

30:51.057 --> 30:53.059
that's including Mom

30:53.142 --> 30:54.310
and Dad

30:54.394 --> 30:55.854
and Tina…

30:55.937 --> 30:57.939
[Erica slurping juice]

30:59.440 --> 31:02.235
…especially Tina,

31:02.318 --> 31:03.278
I…

31:04.237 --> 31:05.488
will smother you

31:06.531 --> 31:07.657
in your sleep.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.160
Do you understand?

31:11.661 --> 31:12.871
Hmm…

31:13.705 --> 31:14.831
Erica?

31:17.834 --> 31:18.668
Do

31:19.627 --> 31:20.545
you

31:21.212 --> 31:22.213
copy?

31:22.297 --> 31:25.383
The smothering in my sleep part,
but not much else.

31:25.466 --> 31:27.719
Why would they open up a gate
at Lover's Lake?

31:28.261 --> 31:29.929
-What?
-The commies.

31:30.013 --> 31:31.931
-The commies didn't.
-Then who did?

31:32.015 --> 31:34.350
-Nobody.
-So it just opened up for fun?

31:34.434 --> 31:36.895
Erica, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

31:36.978 --> 31:41.649
No, she doesn't,
yet she raises an essential question.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.610
How did Watergate open up?

31:43.693 --> 31:46.029
Only two gates have opened,
so far as we know.

31:46.112 --> 31:47.947
One by El, one by the commies.

31:48.031 --> 31:50.408
But it's not the commies
or El this time, so it…

31:50.491 --> 31:52.493
[eerie music playing]

31:55.204 --> 31:56.247
Holy shit.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.333
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:58.416 --> 32:00.168
"Wait, wait, wait," what?

32:00.251 --> 32:03.212
There's one thing we've never understood.

32:04.213 --> 32:06.466
Which is why Vecna's killing people.

32:07.091 --> 32:08.176
What's his motive?

32:08.801 --> 32:11.596
Killing teens?
It always just seemed too random.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.306
Too prosaic.

32:14.223 --> 32:17.685
On top of that, how does
the Mind Flayer figure into all this?

32:18.436 --> 32:20.021
Maybe this is it.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.023
This is the answer.

32:22.106 --> 32:23.733
What is the answer?

32:23.816 --> 32:25.360
You sure you just want water?

32:25.443 --> 32:28.321
-We have Coke, Sprite, Dr. Pepper.
-Coke works. Thank you.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.492
Okay, just hear me out.

32:32.575 --> 32:34.744
How did El open the Mothergate?

32:34.827 --> 32:37.038
She contacted the Demogorgon.

32:37.121 --> 32:39.415
With psychic contact. Just like…

32:40.124 --> 32:42.543
-Vecna when he casts his spells.
-Exactly.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.629
So, what if, with each kill,

32:44.712 --> 32:46.589
he's not simply killing them,

32:46.673 --> 32:49.592
he's making a powerful
psychic connection with his victims?

32:49.676 --> 32:51.177
A connection powerful enough

32:51.260 --> 32:54.389
to rip a hole in the fabric
of time and space.

32:54.472 --> 32:55.807
He's opening more gates.

32:55.890 --> 32:56.891
Bingo.

32:57.558 --> 32:59.560
Copy. We're still at the Wheeler house.

32:59.644 --> 33:01.938
[police radio chatter]

33:02.021 --> 33:04.565
-Why would he be opening gates?
-To take over the world.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.526
Who do we know
that wants to take over the world?

33:06.609 --> 33:07.527
The Mind Flayer.

33:07.610 --> 33:10.321
So if the Demogorgon
was just his foot soldier,

33:10.405 --> 33:12.615
Vecna's his five-star general.

33:13.116 --> 33:16.536
A five-star general
with the power to open gates.

33:17.203 --> 33:19.038
-Holy shit.
-Holy shit.

33:19.122 --> 33:21.541
Holy shit. That was incomprehensible.

33:21.624 --> 33:25.003
You lost me at "Mothergate."
Please be kind. Rewind.

33:25.086 --> 33:26.963
[Dustin] Okay, so remember the gate?

33:27.046 --> 33:28.423
[Erica] Oh, no. I blocked that out.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.717
[Dustin speaking indistinctly]

33:30.800 --> 33:32.719
[Erica] So what was that giant laser?

33:32.802 --> 33:35.179
[buzzing, rattling]

33:52.905 --> 33:54.866
Might be time to get a maid, Wheeler.

33:55.575 --> 33:58.661
Come on. I don't want to stay here
longer than we have to.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.747
[eerie, mysterious music playing]

34:02.790 --> 34:06.169
[Dustin speaking indistinctly and faintly]

34:19.307 --> 34:20.767
Those aren't guns.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.060
These heels are pointy,

34:22.143 --> 34:25.104
but I was hoping for a deadly projectile.

34:25.188 --> 34:28.024
-I don't understand.
-Maybe you left them somewhere else.

34:28.107 --> 34:30.610
There's a six-year-old in the house.
I know where I keep my guns.

34:30.693 --> 34:33.821
And also, I threw these away years ago.

34:35.531 --> 34:37.533
[mysterious music playing]

34:44.916 --> 34:46.542
Jesus. How many did you make?

34:46.626 --> 34:48.044
You said you wanted to help.

34:49.504 --> 34:51.506
I get that grades are important,

34:51.589 --> 34:53.466
but perhaps studying can wait
till we get out?

34:53.549 --> 34:55.885
These are from sophomore chemistry.

34:56.969 --> 35:01.349
And this… this wallpaper,
this is old wallpaper.

35:02.600 --> 35:04.811
And this mirror, this went to a yard sale.

35:05.478 --> 35:07.188
And you…

35:08.481 --> 35:10.233
you're not supposed to be here.

35:10.316 --> 35:12.985
No, I gave you to Cousin Joanna
two years ago.

35:13.069 --> 35:15.071
[mysterious music continues]

35:24.539 --> 35:25.414
What is it?

35:27.125 --> 35:29.418
Nancy? You're freaking me out.

35:30.378 --> 35:33.673
I think the reason
that my guns aren't here

35:35.216 --> 35:37.510
is because they don't exist yet.

35:38.094 --> 35:41.639
They don't… exist?

35:41.722 --> 35:43.766
This diary should be full of entries.

35:43.850 --> 35:44.684
It's not.

35:44.767 --> 35:47.311
The last entry is November 6, 1983.

35:47.395 --> 35:48.938
The day Will went missing.

35:49.522 --> 35:50.982
The day the gate opened.

35:53.693 --> 35:54.986
We're in the past.

35:55.069 --> 35:56.487
[eerie stinger]

35:56.571 --> 35:58.739
[Steve] Dustin! Dustin!

36:01.117 --> 36:02.285
Dustin!

36:02.368 --> 36:03.828
Can you hear me? Dustin!

36:04.328 --> 36:06.414
Du-- Hello? Hel… Hello?

36:06.497 --> 36:09.375
-Maybe he really does have rabies.
-Hello! Hello?

36:09.458 --> 36:10.418
What are you doing?

36:10.501 --> 36:11.836
Hello!

36:11.919 --> 36:15.715
He's here. Henderson.
That little shit, he's here. He's like…

36:15.798 --> 36:18.092
He's in the walls or something.
Just listen.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.427
Dustin.

36:20.094 --> 36:21.596
Dustin! Dustin!

36:22.138 --> 36:24.599
Dustin! Dustin! Can you hear me?

36:25.516 --> 36:28.477
[Dustin] That brings us
to the question you first raised.

36:28.561 --> 36:31.772
How and why
is there a gate at Lover's Lake?

36:32.648 --> 36:33.608
Let's analyze.

36:34.317 --> 36:36.527
What do Eleven and Vecna have in common?

36:37.069 --> 36:38.196
Dustin!

36:40.448 --> 36:42.909
-Dustin?
-Dustin!

36:43.534 --> 36:46.913
All right, either this kid can't hear us
or he's being a total douchebag.

36:47.580 --> 36:49.415
-Will found a way.
-What?

36:49.498 --> 36:50.666
Will.

36:50.750 --> 36:53.920
He found a way
to speak to Joyce through the lights.

36:54.003 --> 36:55.129
-[Steve] Lights?
-Yeah.

36:55.838 --> 36:57.590
-The switch. Try the switch.
-Okay.

36:57.673 --> 36:59.175
[Dustin continuing, faintly]

36:59.258 --> 37:00.593
[Nancy] It's not working.

37:01.177 --> 37:02.094
Guys?

37:04.180 --> 37:05.389
You seeing this?

37:05.473 --> 37:07.475
[energy thrumming]

37:08.476 --> 37:11.437
[Dustin speaking faintly]

37:13.189 --> 37:15.191
[mysterious, ethereal music playing]

37:26.452 --> 37:28.788
[Dustin] …to open a tear
in time and space,

37:28.871 --> 37:30.122
just like the Mothergate.

37:33.334 --> 37:34.418
Whoa.

37:34.502 --> 37:37.546
[ethereal music continues]

37:37.630 --> 37:41.425
[Dustin] …are these like the Mothergate…

37:43.261 --> 37:45.346
But a gate nonetheless.

37:49.725 --> 37:50.726
[Steve exhales]

37:54.188 --> 37:55.064
It…

37:56.691 --> 37:57.733
tickles.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.820
It kinda feels good.

38:03.322 --> 38:05.032
Does anyone know Morse code?

38:05.908 --> 38:06.909
[Robin, Steve] No.

38:08.202 --> 38:09.787
Wait, does SOS count?

38:11.414 --> 38:12.290
Is that…

38:13.582 --> 38:14.625
is that good?

38:15.209 --> 38:19.380
So our working theory is that Vecna
makes remote contact from his attic.

38:19.463 --> 38:22.425
We don't know why.
We assume he can do it from anywhere.

38:22.508 --> 38:24.510
[energy thrumming rhythmically]

38:25.761 --> 38:28.139
-Are you even listening to me?
-I'm listening.

38:28.222 --> 38:29.223
It's just…

38:30.391 --> 38:33.728
You said you followed Vecna
through lights, right?

38:34.854 --> 38:35.813
Yeah, why?

38:36.647 --> 38:38.357
Because I think he's here.

38:42.903 --> 38:45.197
[ethereal music builds]

38:55.666 --> 38:56.876
It's working.

"O."

"S."

39:10.181 --> 39:11.349
Hey, uh,

39:12.683 --> 39:14.769
remember when I said
they wouldn't be stupid enough

39:14.852 --> 39:16.187
to go through Watergate?

39:17.563 --> 39:18.647
Yeah?

39:20.775 --> 39:22.360
I overestimated them.

39:23.152 --> 39:24.153
[wind rushing]

39:31.243 --> 39:34.330
[Murray] Warden,
beautiful prison you got here.

39:35.122 --> 39:38.376
How about this? Huh? [laughs]

39:38.459 --> 39:39.877
How about that? Huh?

39:39.960 --> 39:40.878
Huh?

39:40.961 --> 39:43.005
-[Joyce groans]
-That's what I thought, yeah.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.508
Warden. [chuckles]

39:45.591 --> 39:47.093
So nice to meet you.

39:47.176 --> 39:51.472
Uh, I'm Yuri, of course,
but allow me to introduce you to my very--

39:52.390 --> 39:53.641
Shit.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.684
-[muffled] Murray!
-I'm sorry.

39:56.352 --> 39:57.186
What?

39:57.269 --> 39:59.772
Can you please
stop playing with that thing?

39:59.855 --> 40:02.024
I am not playing. I am practicing.

40:02.108 --> 40:05.403
Will you please stop trying
to talk to me and stay in character?

40:05.486 --> 40:08.614
Remember, you are frightened,
scared, confused.

40:08.697 --> 40:13.619
-Yes, I am frightened, scared, and--
-Okay. All right. Yes. Good.

40:16.372 --> 40:17.540
[in Russian] Yuri Ismaylov.

40:17.623 --> 40:20.000
[laughing]

40:20.084 --> 40:22.253
At last, we meet.

40:22.753 --> 40:23.754
Comrade Major.

40:25.339 --> 40:27.341
This is the Bauman spy?

40:28.426 --> 40:30.177
[Yuri struggling, muffled]

40:30.261 --> 40:32.138
He looks different.

40:32.221 --> 40:34.682
Uglier in person, I know.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.101
He also shaved his beard
to disguise himself.

40:37.184 --> 40:38.394
Tricky bastard.

40:39.186 --> 40:42.189
[in English] Silence, American scum!
Enough from you. Enough!

40:43.399 --> 40:45.276
[laughs wheezily]

40:46.569 --> 40:47.903
[in Russian] Now this one…

40:47.987 --> 40:50.573
This one I would recognize
a continent away.

40:50.656 --> 40:54.285
She was more beautiful
in her uniform, but still,

40:54.368 --> 40:55.870
quite striking, isn't she?

40:55.953 --> 40:59.248
Yes, very pleasing to the eyes, comrade.

40:59.331 --> 41:01.542
But not so pleasing to the ears,
I am afraid.

41:02.334 --> 41:03.878
[in English] Where is he?

41:03.961 --> 41:06.797
What have you done with Hopper,
you vile commie pig?

41:06.881 --> 41:08.048
[in Russian] As I said,

41:09.049 --> 41:10.301
unpleasant.

41:11.677 --> 41:12.928
But, I must say,

41:13.679 --> 41:15.431
I, too, am curious.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.850
The other American.

41:17.933 --> 41:19.435
What did you do with him?

41:19.977 --> 41:22.313
I don't know why,
but I imagine him on a rack,

41:22.396 --> 41:25.858
in the cold, stretched thin,

41:25.941 --> 41:27.985
birds pecking his eyeballs.

41:28.068 --> 41:29.862
Am I... close?

41:31.155 --> 41:33.866
I have heard stories of Yuri Ismaylov,

41:35.201 --> 41:37.286
the Peanut Butter Smuggler.

41:38.954 --> 41:39.914
And you…

41:41.415 --> 41:43.417
you are not the Yuri I have heard of.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.463
I am…

41:48.088 --> 41:49.006
I am not?

41:49.673 --> 41:50.633
No.

41:52.760 --> 41:53.594
No.

[menacing music plays]

41:55.304 --> 41:59.308
The Yuri I was told of had a screw loose.

42:22.206 --> 42:24.542
I hope we have not missed the show.

42:56.323 --> 42:57.616

42:58.617 --> 43:00.411
They are being told the rules.

43:02.830 --> 43:03.872
Rules for what?

43:04.456 --> 43:05.749
I could tell you...

43:06.417 --> 43:08.752
but that would spoil the fun,
now, wouldn't it?

43:08.836 --> 43:10.045
[Murray chuckles]

43:13.382 --> 43:14.842
You wait for the buzzer.

43:15.593 --> 43:16.635
You wait.

43:18.178 --> 43:20.889
You move before the buzzer...

43:21.557 --> 43:23.350
you will be shot.

43:24.602 --> 43:25.853
Is that understood?

43:29.064 --> 43:30.524
Is that understood?

43:30.608 --> 43:32.109
[prisoners] Yes.

43:38.866 --> 43:41.410
I'd wish you luck

43:42.620 --> 43:43.996
but it won't help you.

43:52.588 --> 43:55.466
[in English] Let us hope your prayers
have been heard, American.

You open for something
a little more challenging?

45:17.339 --> 45:19.967
Try not to show any emotion
as I speak, okay?

45:22.428 --> 45:24.638
Just keep playing the game
if you understand.

45:32.813 --> 45:35.023
Two is still in the infirmary recovering.

45:36.442 --> 45:39.361
He's being watched now,
but once he is released,

45:39.445 --> 45:42.030
he and the others
are going to attempt to kill you.

45:42.781 --> 45:43.741
Right here,

45:44.742 --> 45:45.784
in this room.

45:46.326 --> 45:47.828
And Papa

45:47.911 --> 45:49.455
will allow it to happen.

45:49.538 --> 45:51.457
In fact, he wants it to happen.

Stay calm.

45:59.006 --> 46:00.299
Focus on the game.

46:05.471 --> 46:10.392
There's a reason why Two and the others
were able to escape their room last night.

46:11.351 --> 46:13.729
Why the security cameras were turned off.

46:13.812 --> 46:16.064
Why Papa punished Two today.

46:17.733 --> 46:18.776
They don't even realize it,

46:18.859 --> 46:22.112
but he is moving them
like pieces on this board here.

46:24.114 --> 46:25.240
Driving them

46:25.741 --> 46:27.826
to do exactly what he wants,

46:27.910 --> 46:29.244
which is…

46:30.120 --> 46:31.121
[music intensifies]

46:33.957 --> 46:35.083
Why?

46:36.001 --> 46:37.503
You frighten him.

46:37.586 --> 46:41.131
He knows you are more powerful
than the others.

46:41.965 --> 46:44.176
And he also knows he can't control you.

46:45.552 --> 46:47.054
That's all he wants.

Control.

I saw all this happening.

46:51.308 --> 46:54.353
That's why I wanted to help you,
but I only made things worse.

Today.

47:11.578 --> 47:13.497
But they are watching us.

47:14.206 --> 47:15.249
Closely.

47:18.210 --> 47:21.880
If you want to make it out of here alive,
you must do exactly as I say.

47:21.964 --> 47:23.173
Do you understand?

47:30.889 --> 47:33.225
Why do you still help?

47:34.184 --> 47:35.769
Because I believe in you.

After everything they did to you?

1:19:49.534 --> 1:19:50.535
Hmm?

You think you need them, but you don't.

You don't.

Oh, but I know you're just scared.

1:20:12.724 --> 1:20:13.809
what it's like

1:20:15.644 --> 1:20:17.229
to be different.

1:20:19.189 --> 1:20:20.357
To be alone

You were so close.

How was old, blind, dumb Victor?

1:21:40.103 --> 1:21:42.105
This is amazing.

1:21:42.731 --> 1:21:44.482
It looks like a fairy tale.

1:21:45.066 --> 1:21:46.109

1:21:47.193 --> 1:21:49.905
-[Virginia] Alice, no running.
-It's so big!

-[Victor] Yeah.

1:21:57.829 --> 1:21:59.956
I didn't fit in with the other children.

1:22:00.457 --> 1:22:02.500
Something was wrong with me.

1:22:02.584 --> 1:22:05.295
All the teachers
and the doctors said I was…

1:22:06.171 --> 1:22:07.130
"Broken,"

1:22:08.006 --> 1:22:08.924
they said.

1:22:12.844 --> 1:22:14.137
My parents

1:22:15.096 --> 1:22:18.850
thought a change of scenery,
a fresh start in Hawkins,

1:22:19.559 --> 1:22:21.061
might just cure me.

1:22:23.188 --> 1:22:24.397
It was absurd.

1:22:27.108 --> 1:22:29.653
As if the world
would be any different here.

1:22:35.367 --> 1:22:37.369
[solemn choir singing]

[One] But then…

1:22:42.707 --> 1:22:45.752
to my surprise, our new home provided

1:22:45.835 --> 1:22:46.962
a discovery.

1:22:49.172 --> 1:22:51.424
And a newfound sense of purpose.

1:22:52.634 --> 1:22:55.720
I found a nest of black widows
living inside a vent.

1:22:57.305 --> 1:22:59.516
Most people fear spiders.

1:23:00.225 --> 1:23:01.935
They detest them.

1:23:03.687 --> 1:23:04.688
And yet,

1:23:05.230 --> 1:23:08.108
I found them endlessly fascinating.

1:23:09.109 --> 1:23:10.068
More than that,

1:23:11.528 --> 1:23:13.238
I found a great comfort in them.

1:23:13.321 --> 1:23:14.322
[whoosh]

1:23:15.073 --> 1:23:15.991
A kinship.

1:23:18.284 --> 1:23:19.202
Like me,

1:23:20.328 --> 1:23:22.163
they are solitary creatures.

1:23:23.498 --> 1:23:25.375
And deeply misunderstood.

1:23:26.793 --> 1:23:27.752
They

1:23:27.836 --> 1:23:30.588
are gods of our world.

1:23:31.589 --> 1:23:33.758
The most important of all predators.

1:23:34.509 --> 1:23:36.970
They immobilize and feed on the weak,

1:23:37.053 --> 1:23:40.598
bringing balance and order
to an unstable ecosystem.

1:23:43.935 --> 1:23:46.855
But the human world
was disrupting this harmony.

1:23:47.689 --> 1:23:48.732
You see,

1:23:49.441 --> 1:23:50.525
humans

1:23:51.359 --> 1:23:53.695
are a unique type of pest,

1:23:53.778 --> 1:23:54.863
multiplying

1:23:55.530 --> 1:23:57.073
and poisoning our world,

1:23:57.157 --> 1:23:59.909
all while enforcing
a structure of their own.

1:23:59.993 --> 1:24:03.705
A deeply unnatural structure.

1:24:04.539 --> 1:24:07.751
Where others saw order,
I saw a straitjacket.

1:24:07.834 --> 1:24:08.877
[clock ticking]

1:24:08.960 --> 1:24:12.297
A cruel, oppressive world

1:24:12.380 --> 1:24:15.008

1:24:20.096 --> 1:24:22.140
years, decades.

1:24:22.223 --> 1:24:26.394
Each life a faded, lesser copy
of the one before.

Wake up, eat, work, sleep,

1:24:29.522 --> 1:24:31.733

1:24:33.610 --> 1:24:34.903
Everyone

1:24:36.071 --> 1:24:37.280
is just

Waiting

1:24:41.034 --> 1:24:44.245
for it all to be over.

All while performing
in a silly, terrible play,

1:24:52.045 --> 1:24:53.213
[ticking]

1:24:53.296 --> 1:24:54.339
I could not do that.

1:24:55.965 --> 1:24:58.802
I could not close off my mind

1:24:58.885 --> 1:25:00.386
and join in the madness.

1:25:00.470 --> 1:25:02.472
I could not pretend.

1:25:04.390 --> 1:25:05.975
And I realized

1:25:07.602 --> 1:25:08.770
I didn't have to.

1:25:19.739 --> 1:25:21.324
I could make my own rules.

1:25:22.075 --> 1:25:25.995
I could restore balance to a broken world.

1:25:26.079 --> 1:25:27.413
A predator…

1:25:29.666 --> 1:25:30.625
but for good.

1:25:38.007 --> 1:25:40.510
As I practiced, I realized

1:25:40.593 --> 1:25:43.263
I could do more than I possibly imagined.

1:25:44.222 --> 1:25:47.142
I could reach into others,

1:25:47.767 --> 1:25:49.352
into their minds,

1:25:50.228 --> 1:25:51.729
their memories.

1:25:55.692 --> 1:25:57.193
I became an explorer.

1:25:59.154 --> 1:26:01.489
I saw my parents as they truly were.

1:26:03.032 --> 1:26:03.950
To the world,

1:26:04.868 --> 1:26:09.956
they presented themselves
as good, normal people.

1:26:10.039 --> 1:26:12.292
But like everything else in this world,

1:26:12.375 --> 1:26:13.793
it was all a lie.

1:26:14.919 --> 1:26:16.254
A terrible lie.

1:26:18.089 --> 1:26:20.967
They had done things, Eleven.

1:26:21.968 --> 1:26:23.386
Such awful things.

1:26:40.028 --> 1:26:43.448
it was a demon
cursing them for their sins.

1:26:44.324 --> 1:26:46.284
But my mother somehow knew.

1:26:46.367 --> 1:26:50.205
Knew it was I
who was holding up that mirror,

1:26:51.414 --> 1:26:55.460
-and she despised me for it.

She wanted him to lock me away, to fix me,

even though it wasn't I who was broken.
It was them.

1:27:06.638 --> 1:27:08.640
And so she left me with no choice.

1:27:09.265 --> 1:27:10.600
No choice but to act.

To break free.

With each life I took, I grew stronger.

1:27:27.700 --> 1:27:29.035
More powerful.

1:27:30.119 --> 1:27:31.955
They were becoming a part of me.

But I was still a child.

1:27:34.290 --> 1:27:35.625
[electricity buzzing]

1:27:35.708 --> 1:27:37.710
And I did not yet know my limits.

1:27:38.920 --> 1:27:40.672
And it nearly killed me.

1:27:52.100 --> 1:27:55.645
He was arrested, blamed for the death
of my sister and mother,

1:27:55.728 --> 1:27:57.272
just as I had planned.

1:27:58.273 --> 1:28:00.149
But I was far from free.

1:28:01.067 --> 1:28:05.697
I woke up from my coma only to find myself
placed in the care of a doctor,

1:28:05.780 --> 1:28:07.824
the very doctor I had hoped to escape.

But the truth…

1:28:16.749 --> 1:28:20.128
the truth is he did not
just want to study me.

1:28:22.130 --> 1:28:23.256
He wanted more.

1:28:24.549 --> 1:28:25.967
He wanted to control.

1:28:27.844 --> 1:28:31.347
When Papa finally realized
he could not control me,

1:28:32.432 --> 1:28:34.100
he tried to recreate me.

1:28:34.183 --> 1:28:36.436
[tattoo needle buzzing]

1:28:36.519 --> 1:28:38.062
He began a program.

No, I saved you.

1:29:23.858 --> 1:29:25.818
just like me.

1:29:25.902 --> 1:29:30.448
To your papa, you are nothing more
than an animal, a monster,

1:29:30.531 --> 1:29:32.283
a lab rat to be tamed.

1:29:32.367 --> 1:29:34.035

If you come with me,

1:29:55.765 --> 1:29:59.185
for the first time in your life,
you will be free.

1:30:01.979 --> 1:30:04.065
Imagine what we could do together.

1:30:05.274 --> 1:30:08.152
We could reshape the world,

1:30:08.236 --> 1:30:10.905
remake it however we see fit.

1:31:19.223 --> 1:31:22.018
He had found his strength
in a memory from his past.

1:31:22.643 --> 1:31:24.061
Something that made him sad.

1:31:24.145 --> 1:31:25.521
[powerful music building]

1:32:12.985 --> 1:32:14.862
