You want to hate me, fine.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.396
I will not let anything
happen to Michael or you.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.180
Why me?

00:50.180 --> 00:51.877
Because you are just about
the only family I've got left.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.749
Do you even know
what you're after?

00:53.749 --> 00:55.925
Power beyond all comprehension.

00:55.925 --> 00:59.624
If the Breen got ahold of that
power, it would be catastrophic.

00:59.624 --> 01:00.756
We'll be long gone by then.

01:05.587 --> 01:07.110

01:27.870 --> 01:29.698
BURNHAM:

01:29.698 --> 01:31.656
They're numbers
in ancient Halem'nese.

01:31.656 --> 01:33.615
One for each of the five towers.

01:33.615 --> 01:37.488
The vial had the same marks,
so the clue's in tower five.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.403
It had a metal card attached

01:39.403 --> 01:41.449

BURNHAM:
That is a courier channel.

02:41.248 --> 02:43.641
"Special offer"
is code for S.O.S.

02:43.641 --> 02:46.078
So she was hoping
a courier would rescue them.

02:46.078 --> 02:47.384
Luckily we got to them first.

02:47.384 --> 02:49.125
Admiral Vance asked me to bring

02:49.125 --> 02:51.040
a team aboard <i>Discovery</i>
to assist

02:51.040 --> 02:53.477
- with security as you
transfer them to Fed HQ.
- All right.

02:53.477 --> 02:55.131
Glad to have you

02:55.131 --> 02:56.828
Good to be back.

Moll had this stashed on her
when we pulled her out.

02:59.918 --> 03:02.486
Dr. Vellek's diary. We already
have some of it on file,

03:02.486 --> 03:04.096
but let's get started
translating the rest.

03:04.096 --> 03:05.315
It'll tell us everything
we need to know

03:05.315 --> 03:06.403

It is off-limits.

03:09.101 --> 03:10.320
Hey, come on.
Hands off the jacket.

03:10.320 --> 03:12.801
Book. [sighs] You are...

03:12.801 --> 03:14.498
not supposed to be here.

03:14.498 --> 03:17.414
Yeah, uh, I heard Moll and L'ak
are beaming over.

03:17.414 --> 03:18.894
Access is restricted.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.852
No one in or out

03:20.852 --> 03:23.203
They may know things
we don't about the clue trail

03:23.203 --> 03:24.900
or what we'll find
at the end of it.

03:24.900 --> 03:27.250
I've spent more time
with Moll than anyone, so maybe

03:27.250 --> 03:29.165
I can get her to talk.

03:29.165 --> 03:31.211
Report said she nearly
killed you on the <i>Enterprise.</i>

03:31.211 --> 03:33.082
But she didn't.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.736
So, lots of trust there.

03:34.736 --> 03:36.477
- At least let me try.
- NHAN: Last time I saw you--

03:36.477 --> 03:38.696

03:38.696 --> 03:40.829
you fired on <i>Discovery</i>
with photon torpedoes

03:40.829 --> 03:42.483
and set off an isolytic weapon.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.702
And I've been working
to make things right ever since.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.269
NHAN:
That doesn't mean

03:46.269 --> 03:48.228
- you're not a security risk.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.059

03:55.409 --> 03:58.020
If we need help during
our debrief, I'll find you.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.945
He's a good man,

04:09.945 --> 04:12.774
and I do trust him.

04:12.774 --> 04:15.124
I know what he means to you.

04:15.124 --> 04:16.778
That's why I went easy on him.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.828
I'll be right back.

04:26.091 --> 04:27.745
CULBER:

04:27.745 --> 04:30.748
Beaming right into a biobed,
not a good sign.

04:30.748 --> 04:32.141
Well, L'ak is in bad shape.

04:32.141 --> 04:33.664
It's a miracle
he's even still alive.

04:33.664 --> 04:35.971
- And Moll?
- The <i>Locherer</i> reports she's

04:35.971 --> 04:39.366
dehydrated, half starved,
but still kicking.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.846
Literally. When we tried
to separate them,

04:41.846 --> 04:43.239
she went ballistic.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.241
I'm not surprised.

04:45.241 --> 04:47.330
We're modifying the containment
field to hold them together.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.898
Keeping them apart would only
put more stress on his system.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.248
Okay.

04:52.248 --> 04:53.858
Let's do this.

04:53.858 --> 04:56.470
Captain Burnham

05:06.306 --> 05:08.482
I'm giving him something
for the pain,

05:08.482 --> 05:10.484
and then I need to examine him.

05:11.572 --> 05:12.921
We're gonna help him, Moll.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.618
You did this to him.

05:14.618 --> 05:17.447

L'ak is fading.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.781
Some kind of vital organ
must have been hit, but

05:46.781 --> 05:48.783
we don't know enough
about Breen physiology

05:48.783 --> 05:51.481
to do much
besides ease his pain.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.222
We have to do more.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.659
Breen fugitive dying
in Federation custody,

05:55.659 --> 05:58.314
this is politically charged,
to say the least.

05:58.314 --> 06:00.055
Tell me you have a plan.

06:00.055 --> 06:02.405
I did a deep dive into Dominion
War-era medical research.

06:02.405 --> 06:03.885
There is some evidence
that the Breen

06:03.885 --> 06:05.452
are capable
of somatic cell regeneration

06:05.452 --> 06:07.845
in extreme cold, so we located

06:07.845 --> 06:09.543
a captured Breen
refrigeration unit

06:09.543 --> 06:11.545
in an old Fed HQ
storage manifest,

06:11.545 --> 06:13.982
and we may be able to use it
to convert a biobed

06:13.982 --> 06:16.637
into a low-temperature ICU unit.

06:16.637 --> 06:18.900
- It's a long shot.
- Do it.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.989
I'll alert headquarters
to have it ready right now.

06:32.304 --> 06:34.437

06:37.353 --> 06:38.920
BURNHAM:

06:38.920 --> 06:41.444
Captain, we're receiving
a hail from Admiral Vance.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.533
He's requesting to speak
with you before we dock.

06:43.533 --> 06:44.621
Put him through.

06:44.621 --> 06:46.884
Apparently, it's classified.

07:02.073 --> 07:05.076
I'm having the refrigeration
unit beamed over.

07:05.076 --> 07:07.165
Moll and L'ak
will remain in your custody.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.776
I thought we were transferring
them to you?

07:08.776 --> 07:09.951
Change of plans.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.474
Once you receive it,

07:11.474 --> 07:13.868
I need you to jump immediately.

07:13.868 --> 07:15.522
Get them as far away as you can.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.349
Sir, what's happening?

07:19.351 --> 07:22.616

For her security,
she'll remain there.

07:43.332 --> 07:46.378
All nonessential personnel
will shelter in quarters.

07:46.378 --> 07:47.902
How did the Breen even know
we have them?

07:47.902 --> 07:49.294
They must have intercepted

07:49.294 --> 07:51.079
our communication
with the <i>Locherer.</i>

07:51.079 --> 07:53.429
Goes without saying that handing
them over is not an option.

07:53.429 --> 07:54.996
Can't allow the Breen
to become aware

07:54.996 --> 07:56.519
of the Progenitors' technology.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.521
So we jump away with Moll
and L'ak, and then what?

07:58.521 --> 08:00.088
You just deny
the Federation has them?

08:00.088 --> 08:03.004
By all means, Captain,
speak freely.

08:03.004 --> 08:05.049
Apologies, Admiral.

08:05.049 --> 08:07.312
To your point, the Breen
are too smart for games,

08:07.312 --> 08:08.705
but having
Moll and L'ak elsewhere

08:08.705 --> 08:10.577
will at least limit
the immediate risk

08:10.577 --> 08:12.100
and force them
to consider how far

08:12.100 --> 08:13.231
they're willing to push us

08:13.231 --> 08:14.319
in order to fulfill this <i>Erigah.</i>

08:14.319 --> 08:15.886
Well, with all due respect, sir,

08:15.886 --> 08:17.932
we can't keep moving
indefinitely.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.455
They will figure it out
eventually.

08:19.455 --> 08:21.283
They'll start tracking
our jump signature.

08:21.283 --> 08:23.285
They'll leave who knows
what kind of carnage

08:23.285 --> 08:25.809
in their wake as they follow us
and keep following us.

08:25.809 --> 08:27.942
Do you have
an alternative proposal?

08:27.942 --> 08:30.031
Yeah, let <i>Discovery</i> stay.

08:30.031 --> 08:33.034
Force them
to deal with us right now

08:33.034 --> 08:35.558
and find a solution.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.691
It'll come to that
eventually, anyway.

08:37.691 --> 08:39.867
Fair enough.

08:44.611 --> 08:46.351
All right, <i>Discovery</i> stays,

08:46.351 --> 08:49.877
but Moll and L'ak will remain
on board, just in case.

If they need to start a war
to fulfill it, they will.

11:35.129 --> 11:36.783
Let's not forget what happened
the last time

11:36.783 --> 11:38.480
Breen entered Federation space.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.612
Starfleet was caught
flat-footed.

11:40.612 --> 11:42.266
That's not gonna happen
this time.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.921
I've called back some
of our ships as a deterrent,

11:44.921 --> 11:47.271
we'll mount a defense,
if need be.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.230
We just need to keep things calm

11:49.230 --> 11:50.884
until backup arrives.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.712
Something doesn't add up here.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.801
They don't need to come
into Federation territory

11:54.801 --> 11:56.411
to make this demand.

11:56.411 --> 11:58.674
It's a risk for them, too.

11:58.674 --> 12:00.763
Would they really do it
just to fulfill an <i>Erigah?</i>

12:00.763 --> 12:03.723
You believe there is another
reason they want Moll and L'ak?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.550
I think there could be.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.770
As you've said before,

12:07.770 --> 12:10.860
the most powerful weapon
in diplomacy is information.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.644
We need more.

12:16.083 --> 12:18.433
Captain Saru is currently
on a diplomatic mission

12:18.433 --> 12:20.348
not far from Breen space.

12:20.348 --> 12:21.697
In a recent report,

12:21.697 --> 12:23.699
he noted that
their factional wars

12:23.699 --> 12:25.832
stem from a succession dispute.

12:25.832 --> 12:29.661
Competing claims from disparate
branches of the royal bloodline.

12:29.661 --> 12:30.967
A primarch of the royal line

12:30.967 --> 12:32.752
wouldn't need L'ak
for succession,

12:32.752 --> 12:35.406
so what purpose would
he and Moll serve, then?

12:35.406 --> 12:38.583
It doesn't matter.
None of it will matter

12:38.583 --> 12:40.107
if they think they can take us.

12:40.107 --> 12:42.152
My suggestion: We install

12:42.152 --> 12:45.547
thoron emitters on the hull.
Used with duranium shadows,

12:45.547 --> 12:48.332
it'll give the impression
that we're armed to the gills.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.421
At least give them pause.

12:50.421 --> 12:51.988
Or incite them to attack.

12:51.988 --> 12:55.078
[scoffs, chuckles]
So, what--

12:55.078 --> 12:57.124
we should just stick our necks
out on the chopping block?

12:57.124 --> 12:59.996
- Commander Rayner,
we're on the same team here.
- Yeah?

12:59.996 --> 13:02.172
Am I the only one familiar
with the Romulan saying,

13:02.172 --> 13:03.913
"Never turn your back
on a Breen"?

13:03.913 --> 13:07.308
There is nothing to be gained
from xenophobic comments.

13:07.308 --> 13:10.441
I'm not the xenophobic one,
Madam President.

13:10.441 --> 13:13.140
To the Breen,
genocide is a necessity.

13:13.140 --> 13:14.968
Their version
of a Prime Directive.

13:14.968 --> 13:18.232
Commander, wait for me outside.

13:18.232 --> 13:19.842
[scoffs]

13:24.325 --> 13:25.369
[sighs]

13:34.030 --> 13:35.902
Madam President, Admiral,

13:35.902 --> 13:37.904
if Moll and L'ak
have information

13:37.904 --> 13:40.036
that might be helpful,
we have to get it out of them

13:40.036 --> 13:41.342
sooner rather than later.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.039
I was with them on the ISS.

13:43.039 --> 13:44.867
I got a sense
of how they operate.

13:44.867 --> 13:47.348
I think I have a shot.

13:52.396 --> 13:53.963
Then you better take it.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.747
Thank you.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.620
Captain.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.014
Make sure to keep
your Number One in line.

14:01.014 --> 14:04.365
Can't afford any missteps
when the Breen get here.

14:04.365 --> 14:07.020
Understood.
Madam President.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.337
If Vance thinks
a defensive position

14:20.337 --> 14:23.123
is anything short of an
invitation to be decimated...

14:23.123 --> 14:25.473
Well, the admiral is doing the
best he can with what he has.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.040
And he's as concerned as I am

14:27.040 --> 14:28.911
about your ability
to handle this today.

14:28.911 --> 14:31.566
Neither of you understand
what you're up against here.

14:31.566 --> 14:33.307
But I suspect you do.

14:33.307 --> 14:36.005
This seems personal, Rayner.

14:36.005 --> 14:38.921
But if you have valuable intel,
you need to share it.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.705
I already said
what I had to say.

14:42.272 --> 14:45.580
I apologize
for the tone, Captain.

14:47.974 --> 14:50.063
[indistinct announcement
over P.A.]

14:51.673 --> 14:53.327
Dismissed.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.943
Lieutenant Gallo,
place us on Yellow Alert.

15:00.943 --> 15:04.425
All hands prepare for the
imminent arrival of the Breen.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.818
- STAMETS: Hey, Tilly.
- Huh?

15:06.818 --> 15:08.298
Wait, Tilly.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.996
I-I was looking for you
at the science lab

15:09.996 --> 15:11.649
and they said you were taking
a-a shuttle

15:11.649 --> 15:12.955
to Fed HQ?

15:12.955 --> 15:14.043
Yeah, if the Breen
are gonna attack,

15:14.043 --> 15:15.697
my cadets are gonna need me.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.046
We need you here.

15:17.046 --> 15:18.569
Look, um,

15:18.569 --> 15:20.006
this was attached to the clue
we retrieved

15:20.006 --> 15:21.659
from the fifth tower
on Halem'no.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.444
It's a Betazed logo,

15:23.444 --> 15:26.621
and the text translates to
"the labyrinths of the mind."

15:26.621 --> 15:30.277
So, if you and Adira could focus
on the meaning of that phrase,

15:30.277 --> 15:33.497
then I can figure out
the properties of the metal.

15:33.497 --> 15:35.282
Paul, why are we talking
about the clue right now?

15:35.282 --> 15:37.719
The last time the Breen
paid a visit to the Federation,

15:37.719 --> 15:39.634
they destroyed an entire city.

15:39.634 --> 15:42.332
Which is exactly why we need
to keep focusing on this.

15:42.332 --> 15:44.291
Look, the <i>Mitchell</i> is out there,

15:44.291 --> 15:45.988
and their orders

15:45.988 --> 15:48.599
are to stand by in case...

15:50.297 --> 15:53.996
Well, in case they receive
an encrypted message from us.

15:55.258 --> 15:56.868
You mean, in case we can't
compete the mission

15:56.868 --> 15:58.305
because we're all dead.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.089
This clue

16:00.089 --> 16:02.439
is the most important thing
in the Federation right now.

16:02.439 --> 16:05.442
We have to get the Progenitors'
power and keep it safe.

16:05.442 --> 16:09.316
If the Breen
or-or someone else gets it...

16:09.316 --> 16:12.797
And, honestly,
Fed HQ is the safest place

16:12.797 --> 16:15.322
your cadets could be right now.

16:15.322 --> 16:17.889
So...

16:17.889 --> 16:21.328
can I let Adira know
you're on your way to help?

16:23.199 --> 16:24.418
Yes.

16:24.418 --> 16:26.202
Of course.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.640
Dr. Culber, how's he doing?

16:29.640 --> 16:31.251
Improving, slowly.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.209
The blend of
sub-zero gasses promotes

16:33.209 --> 16:35.516
a strong immune response
unique to the Breen.

16:35.516 --> 16:37.257
Can I talk to him?

16:37.257 --> 16:38.910
You can try.

16:44.394 --> 16:47.006
The Breen are on their way.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.486
They demand that
we hand you both over.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.358
You must have foreseen

16:51.358 --> 16:53.969
the possibility they would
intercept your SOS.

16:53.969 --> 16:55.710
What was your plan?

16:55.710 --> 16:57.842
Always been partial
to winging it.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.194
On the ISS,

17:01.194 --> 17:03.370
you said you were trying
to buy your way out

17:03.370 --> 17:05.241
of the <i>Erigah</i> with
the Progenitors' power.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.766
Is there anything else
they would accept as payment?

17:08.766 --> 17:10.333
If there was,

17:10.333 --> 17:12.205
we would have paid it.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.605
A dreadnaught-- the most
powerful warship class

17:21.605 --> 17:23.216
in the entire Breen Imperium--

17:23.216 --> 17:25.000
is coming all the way
to Federation Headquarters

17:25.000 --> 17:26.654
for your <i>Erigah.</i>

17:28.395 --> 17:31.093
This primarch
really wants you. Why?

17:37.621 --> 17:40.015
We could have let you die
out there.

17:42.017 --> 17:44.106
Instead, we're risking our lives
to help you.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.108
If you want to help us,
let us out of here.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.718
Take our chances on our own.

17:47.718 --> 17:50.112
With him in his condition?
You would have no chance.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.071
Some things
are worse than death.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.246
What's worse than death?

17:53.246 --> 17:55.857
This conversation, for starters.

18:00.427 --> 18:03.343
Primarch doesn't actually
plan to kill you, does he?

18:05.562 --> 18:08.609
Who are you?

18:08.609 --> 18:10.654
His child?

18:10.654 --> 18:13.483
Sibling? Cousin?

18:18.967 --> 18:21.883
What does he really want
with you?

18:24.407 --> 18:28.063
Fine, I'll tell you
what he wants. The throne.

18:28.063 --> 18:31.022
I'm guessing, somehow,
you can get it for him,

18:31.022 --> 18:32.807
if he can have you
under his thumb again.

18:32.807 --> 18:34.374
And for someone who fought
for their freedom

18:34.374 --> 18:35.984
that would be worse
than death, wouldn't it?

18:45.254 --> 18:48.431
Oh, it's you, isn't it?

18:51.347 --> 18:54.916
You are the bloodline,
not the primarch.

18:54.916 --> 18:58.224
He can't succeed without you.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.834
Yeah.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.532
Lucky me.

19:02.532 --> 19:05.970
Direct descendent
of the emperor.

19:05.970 --> 19:09.931
The scion of the Breen Imperium.

19:09.931 --> 19:13.239
Makes me sick to even say it.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.981
So do me a favor.

19:16.981 --> 19:18.548
When my uncle gets here...

19:20.594 --> 19:22.813
...spit in his face for me.

19:39.613 --> 19:41.223
<i>ZORA:
I've found a match</i>

19:41.223 --> 19:43.356
<i>for the phrase inscribed

19:43.356 --> 19:46.750

<i>written in 2371

19:50.363 --> 19:52.060
That's one of the scientists
who helped hide

19:52.060 --> 19:53.583
the Progenitors' tech.
Uh, any chance

19:53.583 --> 19:55.455
you can source us a copy?

19:55.455 --> 19:57.544
<i>Only a few thousand

19:57.544 --> 19:59.372
<i>I don't see that
any remain available.</i>

19:59.372 --> 20:02.505
I'm sorry,
there has to be one somewhere.

20:02.505 --> 20:05.508

believe a copy will be helpful.</i>

20:05.508 --> 20:07.684

20:11.862 --> 20:13.299
TILLY:
The original manuscript?

20:13.299 --> 20:14.474
Well, any chance
that still exists?

20:14.474 --> 20:15.475
<i>If it does,</i>

20:15.475 --> 20:16.867
<i>I have no record of it.</i>

20:16.867 --> 20:18.434
Fantastic.

20:18.434 --> 20:20.610
For a second there,
I thought we had a gimmie.

20:20.610 --> 20:24.571
Uh, Zora, could you do a scan
of Starfleet personnel files

20:24.571 --> 20:26.921
to see if there's anyone
with expertise

20:26.921 --> 20:29.315
- on ancient manuscripts?
- Oh, that's a good idea.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.839
<i>Of course, Ensign. One moment.</i>

20:34.929 --> 20:36.974
- [chuckles]: What?
- Nothing, just...

20:36.974 --> 20:38.802
Remember how scared you were to

20:38.802 --> 20:41.675
be on the bridge when we went to
Halem'no? You did a great job.

20:41.675 --> 20:43.111
I don't know about that.
[chuckles]

20:43.111 --> 20:44.417
No, you did.

20:44.417 --> 20:45.809
And you're doing
a great job with this.

20:45.809 --> 20:47.768
You're just...
helping us find the clue.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.639
Just seems like, in general,

20:49.639 --> 20:51.424
you're really finding your way,
and you shouldn't be afraid

20:51.424 --> 20:53.513
to take on more, you know?

20:53.513 --> 20:55.254
You have it in you.

20:57.430 --> 21:01.172
- Well, thanks, Teach.

Uh, Commander Reno, uh,

21:15.535 --> 21:16.710
we could use your help.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.538
If you can talk while I work.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.757
This targeting matrix is screwy.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.324
Got to have accurate weapons

21:22.324 --> 21:24.195
if we start shooting it out
with the Breen.

21:24.195 --> 21:26.720
Everyone seems to think
that's inevitable.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.374
It's the whole
faceless-helmet vibe.

21:28.374 --> 21:31.681
Truncheons. Jackboots.
Where's the nuance?

21:31.681 --> 21:35.250
Yeah, so we're working on
the latest clue. Uh,

21:35.250 --> 21:37.034
it points to a rare manuscript.

21:37.034 --> 21:39.123
We were thinking since you
used to work with those, um...

21:39.123 --> 21:42.562
Uh... I may have padded
my résumé with that one.

21:42.562 --> 21:44.607
Truth is, I used to move

21:44.607 --> 21:48.524
hard-to-find folios for
a shady antiquarian archivist.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.874
Try saying that one
five times fast.

21:50.874 --> 21:53.007
Uh, sorry, you were a smuggler?

21:53.007 --> 21:54.051
I smuggled.

21:54.051 --> 21:55.662
Had a lot of odd jobs

21:55.662 --> 21:58.055
before I committed to Starfleet.

21:58.055 --> 22:00.231
VIP shuttle pilot,

22:00.231 --> 22:02.756

22:02.756 --> 22:04.497
at a cozy little dive

22:04.497 --> 22:06.237
on Ashalon Four.

22:06.237 --> 22:08.370
I'm actually supposed to pick up
a guest shift tonight

22:08.370 --> 22:10.677
at Red's Lounge.
You haven't lived

22:10.677 --> 22:13.114
until you've tried
my Seven of Limes.

22:13.114 --> 22:16.030
Wow, you really got around.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.728
Uh, not... I'm sor...
Not like that.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.861
Oh, yeah, like that.

22:20.861 --> 22:23.646
All right, well,
story for another time. Um...

22:23.646 --> 22:26.257
we are looking for
a very specific manuscript.

22:26.257 --> 22:28.347
It is a handwritten
Betazoid text

22:28.347 --> 22:30.479
called <i>Labyrinths of the Mind.</i>

22:30.479 --> 22:31.741
RENO:
Never heard of it.

22:31.741 --> 22:33.090
There's a lot of places

22:33.090 --> 22:35.005
something like that
could end up.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.921
Private collections, museums,

22:37.921 --> 22:39.445
in a landfill.

22:39.445 --> 22:41.098
We can't hit a dead end here.

22:41.098 --> 22:43.492
Once we figure this out,
it'll take us to the final clue.

22:43.492 --> 22:46.800
No, no, we'll figure it out.
Walk with me.

22:46.800 --> 22:49.106
I've got shield emitters
to overhaul before the Breen...

22:49.106 --> 22:51.152

23:24.446 --> 23:27.057
That Breen ship--
that's the same ship that we saw

23:27.057 --> 23:28.581
on the time-bug cycle.

23:28.581 --> 23:31.148
The one that destroyed
Federation Headquarters.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.456

What are the scans telling us?

23:34.456 --> 23:37.024
Scans can't penetrate
their shields, Admiral.

23:38.155 --> 23:40.201
Hail them.

23:40.201 --> 23:42.595
I do hope some
actionable intelligence

23:42.595 --> 23:45.075
- came from your visit with L'ak?
- BURNHAM: Yes.

23:45.075 --> 23:47.513
Without him, this primarch
has no claim to the throne.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.210
We just need time
to figure out how to use

23:49.210 --> 23:51.560
that information to get them
to leave, peacefully.

23:51.560 --> 23:54.215

I demand you transfer
the fugitives to my ship.

24:10.884 --> 24:13.408

24:13.408 --> 24:15.584
I've been empowered
by Federation President Rillak

24:15.584 --> 24:17.456
to greet you

24:17.456 --> 24:19.849
There will be no negotiation.

24:19.849 --> 24:21.895
The fugitives. Immediately.

24:21.895 --> 24:25.115
L'ak and Moll are currently
receiving medical treatment,

24:25.115 --> 24:26.856
and any extradition orders

24:26.856 --> 24:28.728
would need to be drafted
and approved.

24:28.728 --> 24:30.730
Four hours should suffice.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.427
RUHN:
One hour.

24:32.427 --> 24:35.735
Failure to comply will be
considered an act of war.

24:39.347 --> 24:41.567
Extradition orders?

24:41.567 --> 24:45.353
It seemed preferable to claims
of a tribble infestation.

24:47.442 --> 24:49.531
You said you needed time

24:49.531 --> 24:51.577

you learned

Thank you.

24:57.365 --> 24:59.541
I do have an idea.

Okay, Zora, um,
eliminate star systems

in ionized beryllium

25:05.547 --> 25:07.375

25:22.608 --> 25:24.871
- So much for my shortcut.
- Hey. There you are.

25:24.871 --> 25:26.612
I was looking for you earlier.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.918
They said that you were
with Tilly, but to check back.

25:28.918 --> 25:31.051
Yeah, w-we're dividing
and conquering with the clue.

25:31.051 --> 25:33.575
Uh, I'm working on
where the card came from

25:33.575 --> 25:36.883
and Tilly and Adira
are figuring out the phrase.

25:36.883 --> 25:39.102
- Uh, what do you need?
- I want to help.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.190

25:40.190 --> 25:42.366

- Yeah.

25:42.366 --> 25:44.151

I'm shite at sitting around.

So, until someone needs me
to pick up a phaser

25:45.631 --> 25:48.372
and take on some Breen,
I'm all yours.

25:48.372 --> 25:52.115
Okay, great. Well, n-not
the "taking on Breen" part.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.900
Hopefully, it won't
come to that, but, um,

25:53.900 --> 25:56.424
you can help find anything
that will point us

25:56.424 --> 25:57.860
toward where in space

25:57.860 --> 26:00.297
this was made.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.038
Okay, so I take it these are our

26:02.038 --> 26:03.605
possible origin points?

26:03.605 --> 26:06.739
Yeah, well, um,
there used to be more of them.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.567
A needle in a haystack, then.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.873
Try a needle
in a hundred million haystacks.

26:10.873 --> 26:14.573
Okay. Let's start looking.

26:22.972 --> 26:25.061
Commander.

26:25.061 --> 26:26.585
I was strategizing.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.978
We're running out of time.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.676
What do you know
about Breen leadership?

26:30.676 --> 26:32.199
Succession, specifically.

26:33.374 --> 26:35.071
Not much. Why?

26:35.071 --> 26:38.379
We know that the primarch
needs L'ak to claim the throne.

26:38.379 --> 26:40.990
I think we can use that.
I'm just not sure how.

26:42.949 --> 26:45.429
We're dealing with
a culture that we know

26:45.429 --> 26:47.606
nearly nothing about.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.434
Rayner, you do.

26:50.434 --> 26:52.567
You had a strong
reaction earlier,

26:52.567 --> 26:54.700
and I... I didn't
fully understand it,

26:54.700 --> 26:57.354
but then I did a little digging
and learned

26:57.354 --> 26:59.618
that Kellerun was used
as a Breen outpost

26:59.618 --> 27:01.576
for a number of years.

27:01.576 --> 27:03.273
Your home.

27:08.496 --> 27:10.890
That was a long time ago.

27:12.718 --> 27:14.633
I don't...

27:16.635 --> 27:19.072
It's not something
I like to talk about.

27:22.728 --> 27:24.904
Can you at least tell me
if you had any run-ins

27:24.904 --> 27:26.993
with a Primarch Ruhn?

27:28.168 --> 27:29.648
No.

27:31.911 --> 27:34.217
Another primarch
controlled our planet.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.656

27:49.276 --> 27:51.974
Chose it as a forward base.

27:51.974 --> 27:54.542
Used it as a munitions
resupply hub.

27:57.501 --> 28:00.722
Tahal clear-cut our forests,
poisoned our seas,

28:00.722 --> 28:03.377
blackened our skies.

28:03.377 --> 28:05.771
I don't even know how many died.

28:07.033 --> 28:10.253
Collateral damage in whatever
war she was fighting.

28:10.253 --> 28:13.561
We put up a hell of a fight.

28:18.131 --> 28:20.960
But I'm the only one
of my family that made it.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.005
I'm sorry.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.354
Yeah.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.707
Breen cannot be negotiated with.

28:30.578 --> 28:32.798
Not when they want something.

28:37.716 --> 28:39.152
BURNHAM:
We just need to get Ruhn
to believe

28:39.152 --> 28:40.631
we can offer him something
he wants more

28:40.631 --> 28:41.937
than Moll and L'ak.

28:43.765 --> 28:46.855
And I think you just
gave us a way.

28:52.948 --> 28:54.689

and Archive.

29:34.294 --> 29:35.599
A mouthful, I know.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.297
We just called it the archive.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.603
It's like a bank
but it protects knowledge.

engraved on a piece of metal?

29:55.010 --> 29:56.533
Yeah. Does that mean something?

29:57.578 --> 30:00.537
Well, might be the library card.

30:00.537 --> 30:02.278

46:04.457 --> 46:07.112
This isn't how our story ends.

46:09.201 --> 46:11.681
This isn't how
our story ends.

46:20.603 --> 46:22.649
[monitor flatlining]

46:25.043 --> 46:27.088
[crying]

46:40.928 --> 46:42.538
RUHN:
You killed the Scion.

46:42.538 --> 46:45.193
BURNHAM:
No, no, he did this to himself.

46:45.193 --> 46:47.761
CULBER: He hacked a biobed
and injected himself

46:47.761 --> 46:49.676
with a massive
dose of tricordrazine.

46:49.676 --> 46:52.984
RUHN: Intention is nothing.
Outcome is everything.

46:52.984 --> 46:54.724
Prepare for battle.

47:01.906 --> 47:03.777
T'RINA:
L'ak is dead.

47:03.777 --> 47:05.605
Ruhn has ordered the troops
back to their ship,

47:05.605 --> 47:07.302
and all torpedo systems
to be armed.

47:07.302 --> 47:09.957
Everybody, just take it easy.

47:09.957 --> 47:10.958
[speaks Breen]

47:12.264 --> 47:14.353
Red alert. Shields up.

47:14.353 --> 47:15.615
If anyone's gonna make a move,

47:15.615 --> 47:17.573
I strongly suggest
we be the first.

47:17.573 --> 47:19.445
What we do here,
Admiral, will make waves

47:19.445 --> 47:21.012
that may strike many worlds.

47:21.012 --> 47:22.970
You want to survive long
enough to see that happen?

47:22.970 --> 47:25.451
- Because at this rate...
- Commander!
- TEEMO: Admiral.

47:25.451 --> 47:28.715
Four warp signatures
are arriving. They're Starfleet.

47:28.715 --> 47:30.935
Not a moment too soon.

47:43.382 --> 47:47.081
BURNHAM:
The Federation
brought him here to save him.

47:47.081 --> 47:48.778
We would have no reason
to wish him any harm.

47:48.778 --> 47:50.563
He overdosed on a stimulant.
Part of a plan to escape.

47:50.563 --> 47:54.088
- Those lies will be
your last words.
- Wait.

47:56.656 --> 47:58.963
It's true.

47:58.963 --> 48:02.183
He did it for us,
so we could be free.

48:02.183 --> 48:04.316
Your words are not proof.

48:05.317 --> 48:08.668
You think a war to avenge him
will unite the Breen behind you?

48:08.668 --> 48:11.105
If I cannot use
the Scion in life,

48:11.105 --> 48:13.586
I will use him in death.

48:13.586 --> 48:17.807
Yeah, well,
I go where L'ak goes.

48:20.593 --> 48:21.942
Even in death.

48:23.726 --> 48:28.079
This is the privilege
of our joining.

48:28.079 --> 48:32.213
- An abomination.
- No, a marriage.

48:32.213 --> 48:36.565
Which means you are
obligated to take me with you.

48:36.565 --> 48:38.698
- Moll, what are you doing?
- I'm not talking to you.

48:38.698 --> 48:40.961
You will never
be welcome among us.

48:40.961 --> 48:42.963
MOLL:
Maybe this will help.

48:42.963 --> 48:45.096
The Federation's
hiding something from you.

48:45.096 --> 48:47.794
A power so great

48:47.794 --> 48:50.797
you won't need L'ak
to claim the throne.

48:50.797 --> 48:53.234
No one will stand in your way.

48:53.234 --> 48:58.022
And I can get it for you
if you take me with you.

49:11.600 --> 49:14.125
If you wish to avoid war,
she is my price.

49:14.125 --> 49:16.431
She is under our protection.

49:16.431 --> 49:20.131
I will allow you five minutes
to transport her to my ship.

49:22.263 --> 49:24.874
<i>BOOK:
She's not thinking straight.</i>

49:24.874 --> 49:26.528
BURNHAM:
Or she is, and she has a plan.

49:26.528 --> 49:28.966
T'RINA: Her motives
are irrelevant at this moment.

49:28.966 --> 49:31.446
I have a decision to make
on behalf of the Federation.

49:31.446 --> 49:33.274
That is where our attention
should be.

49:33.274 --> 49:36.321
[distorted voices echoing]

49:42.980 --> 49:45.765
Okay, risk analysis.

49:45.765 --> 49:48.159
Does Moll know any details
about the Progenitors'

49:48.159 --> 49:50.204
technology that she
hasn't yet told the Breen?

49:50.204 --> 49:52.467
Nhan's team translated
the rest of the diary.

49:52.467 --> 49:54.643
Nothing of substance,
but there is a passage

49:54.643 --> 49:56.297
that may be pertinent.

49:56.297 --> 49:58.430
Dr. Vellek believed
that since the technology

49:58.430 --> 50:00.040
could be used to create life,

50:00.040 --> 50:02.695
it might also be used
to revive the dead.

50:02.695 --> 50:04.436
- Bit of a stretch.
- BURNHAM: Doesn't matter.

50:04.436 --> 50:06.003
What matters is that she thinks
it'll bring L'ak back.

50:06.003 --> 50:07.352
That's why she's doing this.

50:07.352 --> 50:08.527
RAYNER:
Why would she go with the Breen?

50:08.527 --> 50:10.268
They have an <i>Erigah</i> on her head.

50:10.268 --> 50:12.096
Moll told us they'd use
the technology to pay for it.

50:12.096 --> 50:13.706
So by helping the Breen,

50:13.706 --> 50:16.187
she gets L'ak and their freedom
at the same time.

50:16.187 --> 50:18.189
Ruhn will kill her the second
he has this technology.

50:18.189 --> 50:19.668
Maybe she has
a plan for that, too.

50:19.668 --> 50:21.018
Are there further considerations

50:21.018 --> 50:22.758
from a strategic perspective?

50:22.758 --> 50:25.065
She doesn't have the clue
from Halem'no. We do.

50:25.065 --> 50:27.067
Once it's decoded,
we can jump immediately.

50:27.067 --> 50:30.027
They can track our signature,
but speed is on our side.

50:30.027 --> 50:32.203
You can't actually be
considering this.

50:37.904 --> 50:39.993
We can't give her to them.

50:41.864 --> 50:44.737
VANCE:
We are now in a race
with the Breen,

50:44.737 --> 50:46.521
whether they hold her
in their custody or not.

50:46.521 --> 50:49.307
Well, shouldn't she be tried
for what happened on Q'Mau?

50:49.307 --> 50:51.439
She also committed crimes
in Breen space

50:51.439 --> 50:54.051
and will be held accountable
or not according to their laws.

50:54.051 --> 50:58.664
Unfortunately, it seems
there is little to be lost

50:58.664 --> 51:01.058
by allowing this,

51:01.058 --> 51:03.930
and much to be lost
by keeping her.

51:17.378 --> 51:19.598
This is wrong, Michael.

51:43.796 --> 51:45.493
STAMETS:
We figured it out.

51:45.493 --> 51:48.801
The next clue is in a place
called The Eternal Gallery

51:48.801 --> 51:50.281
and Archive.

51:50.281 --> 51:52.196
It changes location
about every 50 years.

51:52.196 --> 51:54.720
We found records for
18 different locations

51:54.720 --> 51:56.896
over the past 900 years or so.

51:56.896 --> 51:58.115
And each of those records
mentioned

51:58.115 --> 51:59.986
a metal "library card,"

51:59.986 --> 52:01.422
which is used to gain access

52:01.422 --> 52:03.816
to a specific item
stored in there, so...

52:03.816 --> 52:06.166
- So where's the Archive now?
- STAMETS: Well, thanks to Book,

52:06.166 --> 52:07.776
we know that it's in a region
that has

52:07.776 --> 52:10.562
a lot of ionic discharge
in close proximity.

52:12.781 --> 52:14.218
Every second counts.
We don't have time

52:14.218 --> 52:16.220
- to search all that.
- ADIRA: We don't have to.

52:16.220 --> 52:18.831
Zora, can you please show us
all the archive's

52:18.831 --> 52:20.180
known previous locations?

52:20.180 --> 52:21.486
And can you overlay
the datasets?

52:21.486 --> 52:23.314
<i>ZORA:
Of course, Ensign.</i>

52:23.314 --> 52:26.186
TILLY: The Archive has been
on a path moving through space

52:26.186 --> 52:29.276
over centuries,
so tracing the prior locations,

52:29.276 --> 52:31.235
we land on a match here.

52:31.235 --> 52:33.193
This is where it is now.

52:33.193 --> 52:35.456
- The Badlands.
- Been there.

52:35.456 --> 52:39.112
- It's as fun as it sounds.
- Then we won't stay long.

52:39.112 --> 52:41.070
We'll get in quick,
and get out even quicker.

52:41.070 --> 52:43.377
Really good work, team.
Thank you. Prepare to jump.

52:43.377 --> 52:44.683
Let's go get our last clue.

52:48.513 --> 52:50.210
BURNHAM:
Commander.

52:53.909 --> 52:56.347
Today must have been
really difficult.

52:57.826 --> 52:59.959
Hell, I mutinied rather
than giving an inch back

52:59.959 --> 53:01.613
to the Klingons.

53:01.613 --> 53:04.572
A lot of good that did you.

53:06.661 --> 53:08.663
Yeah.

53:08.663 --> 53:10.622
You did really well today.

53:12.885 --> 53:16.976
What they did to
my planet, though...

53:16.976 --> 53:18.978
never gonna happen again.

53:18.978 --> 53:21.198
We'll make sure of it.

53:27.856 --> 53:29.075
Status report.

53:29.075 --> 53:30.946
Comms channels are open,
Captain.

53:30.946 --> 53:33.340
Spore-drive system
is in jump configuration.

53:33.340 --> 53:35.690
Shields and scanning systems
are nominal.

53:35.690 --> 53:38.040
Science is standing by
for location analysis.

53:38.040 --> 53:39.128
Commander Asha, there's
gonna be some turbulence.

53:39.128 --> 53:40.478
I hope you like a challenge.

53:40.478 --> 53:41.827
Love a challenge, Captain.

53:41.827 --> 53:45.570
All right, then.
Black alert.
