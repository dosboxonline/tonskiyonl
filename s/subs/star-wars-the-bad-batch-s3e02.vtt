WEBVTT

00:51.958 --> 00:56.791
Who dares summon me here
and question my loyalty?

00:57.416 --> 01:00.541
The charges against me are false!

01:00.541 --> 01:02.791
Stop wasting our time, Captain.

01:03.708 --> 01:06.541
Confess to your crimes,
and we may show mercy.

01:06.541 --> 01:08.250
What proof do you have?

01:08.916 --> 01:12.333
Your accomplices have been captured
and told us everything.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.583
There is no need for further deception.

01:16.375 --> 01:19.916
You are guilty of conspiracy
against this family.

01:20.625 --> 01:22.125
Any last words?

01:23.750 --> 01:28.375
This syndicate has grown weak
under your rule, Lady Durand.

01:29.375 --> 01:30.708
Weak, you say?

01:32.666 --> 01:34.458
Who here agrees?

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
Cowards!

01:43.375 --> 01:46.500
You're dismissed, Captain.

01:53.250 --> 01:55.333
Who stands before me next?

02:12.250 --> 02:14.166
The mercenaries we discussed.

02:18.583 --> 02:21.833
Such courage
to demand an audience with me.

02:22.541 --> 02:26.500
You'd be dead if my son hadn't
convinced me to consider your offer.

02:27.666 --> 02:29.458
And we're here to deliver.

02:31.541 --> 02:34.250
You asked for the Pyke
who disgraced your family.

02:34.750 --> 02:36.791
He's all yours.

02:36.791 --> 02:40.166
It won't be traced back to you.
We made sure of it.

02:41.916 --> 02:43.083
Take him below.

02:43.083 --> 02:46.083
No. No!

02:46.083 --> 02:48.625
This isn't over, Durand.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.166
Impressive.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.000
Your willingness to cross the Pykes
shows how desperate you are.

02:56.500 --> 03:02.250
Tell me. Why is the intel you've requested
of such value to you?

03:02.750 --> 03:05.208
Dr. Hemlock stole someone from us.

03:05.708 --> 03:08.041
We heard your syndicate had
the connections needed

03:08.041 --> 03:10.041
to find the Imperial's base.

03:10.541 --> 03:12.916
And since we've upheld our end
of the bargain,

03:14.208 --> 03:15.541
now it's your turn.

03:39.541 --> 03:42.500
Hemlock's whereabouts have been
well guarded by the Empire,

03:43.416 --> 03:47.375
but one of our sources came across these
coordinates linked to his laboratory.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.750
And they've been verified?

03:49.750 --> 03:56.416
Take what you came for and go,
before my generosity runs out.

04:01.333 --> 04:03.541
I hope you find who you're looking for.

04:46.958 --> 04:49.583
Echo said he and Rex need two rotations

04:49.583 --> 04:52.000
before they can meet us
at the coordinates.

04:53.833 --> 04:55.625
That's not good enough.

04:55.625 --> 04:56.875
We're going now.

04:57.791 --> 05:02.625
Hunter, the last time we stormed
an Imperial base without backup,

05:03.916 --> 05:06.166
not all of us made it out.

05:12.333 --> 05:15.625
Omega's been waiting for us
a long time, Wrecker.

05:16.250 --> 05:18.125
I'm not making her wait another day.

05:54.166 --> 05:57.000
It smells like rancid Jotaz out here.

05:57.750 --> 05:59.375
There's nothing on the scanners.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.416
The Empire could be jamming our sensors.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.083
Oh, no.

06:33.291 --> 06:34.666
Whoa.

06:34.666 --> 06:36.500
That's Hemlock's lab?

06:39.125 --> 06:40.333
They destroyed it.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.125
Another orbital bombardment.

06:43.125 --> 06:46.791
But Omega. I-I-If she was here--

06:46.791 --> 06:48.583
We don't know if she was.

06:48.583 --> 06:52.083
The Durands' intel could be wrong.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.250
Let's get down there and check it out.

07:10.708 --> 07:12.041
We're not alone.

07:16.166 --> 07:17.666
Freeze!

07:17.666 --> 07:18.916
Drop your weapons.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.125
Blaster beats stick, kid.

07:23.125 --> 07:26.500
Wrecker, they're regs.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.583
And who are you?

07:30.333 --> 07:32.791
We're clones. Same as you.

07:33.541 --> 07:35.541
You don't look like clones.

07:35.541 --> 07:36.791
They must be 99s.

07:37.375 --> 07:38.541
Defectives.

07:38.541 --> 07:41.416
Defective and effective.

07:42.041 --> 07:44.083
What are you two doing out here?

07:44.083 --> 07:47.125
What's it look like? Surviving.

07:47.125 --> 07:50.208
Or trying to. No thanks to the Empire.

07:50.833 --> 07:52.333
They send you to finish us off?

07:52.833 --> 07:55.750
Do we look like we're with the Empire?

07:57.333 --> 07:58.500
What do you want?

07:58.500 --> 08:00.250
We're looking for a young girl.

08:00.791 --> 08:02.000
She's a clone.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.041
We think she was sent to the lab here.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.333
Never saw anyone like that,
but Mox might know about her.

08:09.333 --> 08:10.666
He won't talk to them.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.375
Please, we have to find her.

08:13.375 --> 08:15.958
She's part of our squad.

08:19.250 --> 08:20.458
Stick to the trail.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.041
Follow our steps.

08:22.041 --> 08:24.500
And don't touch the vines.

08:32.208 --> 08:34.333
When the Empire transferred us off Kamino,

08:34.333 --> 08:36.125
we thought we were getting more training.

08:36.125 --> 08:38.500
Instead, they made us prisoners.

08:38.500 --> 08:39.916
Took samples of our blood.

08:40.458 --> 08:43.458
Why?
What was the Empire doing here?

08:43.458 --> 08:44.625
Whatever they wanted.

08:45.416 --> 08:48.083
At least we escaped
before they destroyed the facility.

08:48.666 --> 08:51.166
And you survived alone
out here ever since?

08:51.833 --> 08:53.125
We're soldiers.

08:53.125 --> 08:55.250
Or we were supposed to be.

09:04.333 --> 09:05.541
Stop.

09:05.541 --> 09:06.666
What?

09:08.125 --> 09:09.625
Wrecker, behind you.

09:15.458 --> 09:16.541
Run!

09:18.166 --> 09:20.791
Don't fire!
It gets hostile when you shoot.

09:20.791 --> 09:23.083
You mean it's not already hostile?

09:23.083 --> 09:24.250
No!

09:29.583 --> 09:31.291
Hunter!

09:36.375 --> 09:37.458
Come on!

09:47.458 --> 09:50.375
What was that stuff?

09:50.375 --> 09:52.208
Slither vines.

09:52.208 --> 09:53.583
The Empire made it.

09:53.583 --> 09:57.416
It's some kind of experimental weapon,
until they lost control of it.

09:57.416 --> 10:01.125
Probably why they ordered
a Base Delta Zero on their own facility.

10:01.125 --> 10:02.750
We'll be safe on the crag.

10:02.750 --> 10:04.791
The slither vines haven't spread there.

10:04.791 --> 10:05.875
Yet.

10:06.750 --> 10:09.208
And this time, don't touch anything.

10:09.708 --> 10:10.916
Yeah, yeah.

10:21.500 --> 10:22.500
Mox.

10:27.041 --> 10:28.041
Who are they?

10:28.541 --> 10:29.541
Clones.

10:29.541 --> 10:31.000
We found them by the overlook.

10:34.625 --> 10:36.666
It's quite a place you got here.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.375
What do you want?

10:39.375 --> 10:41.166
We're looking for a young girl.

10:41.166 --> 10:43.750
She was taken
by an Imperial named Hemlock.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.500
Her name's Omega.

10:46.791 --> 10:48.583
Never saw a girl around the lab.

10:49.541 --> 10:50.666
But I know Hemlock.

10:51.166 --> 10:54.166
He was in charge until things changed.

10:55.541 --> 10:58.708
One day, the Imperials started packing up
and shipped out.

10:59.208 --> 11:01.041
So we made our move and escaped.

11:02.583 --> 11:06.000
We were the only ones who made it out
before the orbital bombardment.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.666
Even the clone troopers left us to die.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.083
Said they were following orders.

11:12.375 --> 11:13.375
We get it.

11:14.208 --> 11:15.791
We've lost people too.

11:17.750 --> 11:19.750
We can take you to someplace safe,

11:20.250 --> 11:24.250
but we need to find out if Omega was here
or where Hemlock took her.

11:25.375 --> 11:27.666
There has to be some intel in that base.

11:30.500 --> 11:33.666
One of the control room panels
was still intact during our last scout.

11:34.666 --> 11:37.708
I tried to use it to send a signal,
but there was no power.

11:37.708 --> 11:39.083
Can you take us there?

11:39.083 --> 11:40.166
No way.

11:40.166 --> 11:42.708
That area is covered in slither vines.

11:42.708 --> 11:43.875
It's toxic.

11:44.541 --> 11:45.708
Stak's right.

11:45.708 --> 11:48.291
Going near those ruins
is a suicide mission.

11:48.833 --> 11:49.916
You're on your own.

11:50.500 --> 11:51.958
They need help, Mox.

11:52.708 --> 11:53.750
I'll go with them.

12:02.333 --> 12:04.333
You know the risks of going down there.

12:11.166 --> 12:12.916
And I thought he was the smart one.

12:22.958 --> 12:24.500
I can get you inside the ruins,

12:25.041 --> 12:28.208
but you won't be able to get anything
from the console without a power source.

12:28.208 --> 12:29.458
We got that covered.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.208
Just need to grab something from our ship.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.000
This clone you're looking for...

12:37.000 --> 12:38.083
Omega.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.333
How long has she been gone?

12:40.333 --> 12:41.875
Too long.

12:41.875 --> 12:43.166
But we're not giving up.

12:44.416 --> 12:46.750
I wish the other clones
felt that way about us.

12:47.708 --> 12:51.375
You may be defective CTs,
but at least you're loyal.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.125
Whoa!

13:03.125 --> 13:04.833
Your ship has seen some action.

13:05.708 --> 13:07.416
Mostly during the war.

13:08.541 --> 13:09.833
And some after.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.166
I thought, one day,
I'd be flying one of these on a mission.

13:16.041 --> 13:17.416
A lot's changed.

13:21.083 --> 13:23.875
Well, I've got the gear and the power.

13:25.291 --> 13:26.875
Lead the way, kid.

13:51.333 --> 13:53.666
There's slither vines everywhere in there.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.333
- Be careful where you step.
- Whoa!

14:24.833 --> 14:27.166
How much further is the console?

14:27.166 --> 14:28.541
Hard to tell.

14:28.541 --> 14:30.333
More vines have spread down here.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.791
We had to stop scavenging the site
because of it.

14:33.625 --> 14:36.416
What other experiments were going on
in this place?

14:36.416 --> 14:37.750
Nothing good.

14:38.583 --> 14:40.583
They didn't exactly tell us
what was going on.

15:24.541 --> 15:25.750
Go! Keep moving!

15:48.250 --> 15:49.541
What are we waiting for?

15:49.541 --> 15:51.625
Let's take their ship and get out of here.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.000
What about Deke?

15:55.583 --> 15:56.666
He made his choice.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.166
If we leave him behind,

15:59.166 --> 16:02.291
then we're no better than the troopers
who did the same to us.

16:03.916 --> 16:04.916
Mox.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.125
Those two clones seem different.

16:09.375 --> 16:12.333
They're risking their lives
to find a member of their squad.

16:12.875 --> 16:14.041
I respect that.

16:14.750 --> 16:16.666
They won't make it back from the ruins.

16:16.666 --> 16:17.875
You know that.

16:18.375 --> 16:22.833
If we wait and the slither vines reach
their ship, our chance to escape is gone.

16:25.791 --> 16:26.916
Where's their ship?

16:26.916 --> 16:28.083
Northern ridge.

16:30.625 --> 16:31.625
Show me.

16:45.458 --> 16:49.833
I didn't think it could smell any worse,
but I was wrong.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.333
We're in agreement on that.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.833
There's the console. Come on.

17:51.708 --> 17:53.375
All right.

17:53.375 --> 17:54.791
Do your thing, little guy.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.875
Something's coming.

18:06.875 --> 18:08.208
We need to make this quick.

18:08.208 --> 18:10.000
Is it more of those things?

18:10.833 --> 18:11.833
No.

18:12.333 --> 18:15.000
Something else.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.666
I'm familiar with the system.
Give me some time.

18:17.666 --> 18:19.416
I'll see what data I can pull up.

18:59.833 --> 19:00.833
Got it.

19:16.041 --> 19:18.041
You really think you can fly this thing?

19:19.250 --> 19:22.000
I was top of my class in flight training
back on Kamino.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.000
Where will we go?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.750
Anywhere is better than here.

19:29.416 --> 19:32.125
Check this out. A DC-17.

19:44.958 --> 19:47.791
<i>Mox, Mox! Stak!</i>

19:47.791 --> 19:50.041
<i>The vines. They're everywhere.</i>

19:50.041 --> 19:51.458
<i>Help! We need help!</i>

19:51.458 --> 19:53.708
<i>Mox! Come in, Mox!</i>

19:56.125 --> 19:57.666
Time's up. Get the datapad!

20:07.958 --> 20:09.750
Whoa! Look out!

20:55.791 --> 20:56.791
It's everywhere!

21:03.875 --> 21:05.125
Keep it steady!

21:16.208 --> 21:17.250
Grab the cables!

21:50.750 --> 21:52.083
Shoot for the mouth!

21:56.416 --> 21:57.833
We need more firepower!

22:02.916 --> 22:04.291
That's not enough!

22:04.291 --> 22:06.333
Grab the case of explosives.

22:38.708 --> 22:39.666
Yeah!

22:46.541 --> 22:47.916
Go, go, go!

23:17.708 --> 23:19.875
I've been going over the data.

23:20.916 --> 23:25.250
Looks like Hemlock transferred his entire
base of operations to another location.

23:26.166 --> 23:28.208
His experiments too.

23:29.333 --> 23:31.291
Did the intel say where he went?

23:32.291 --> 23:35.625
There was a mention of a sector
but nothing more.

23:36.458 --> 23:40.333
It's a lead,
but we've got a lot of space to cover.

23:40.333 --> 23:44.125
Well, if that's where Omega is,
then that's where we're going.

23:46.166 --> 23:48.291
We'll drop you three off someplace safe.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.000
Where?

23:50.500 --> 23:51.708
An island.

23:51.708 --> 23:53.291
There are good people there.

23:53.916 --> 23:55.166
They'll take care of you.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.833
We're cadets without an army.

23:58.583 --> 24:00.333
I don't know where we fit anymore.

24:00.916 --> 24:02.541
You have time to figure it out.

24:03.458 --> 24:05.583
Make your own path.

24:05.583 --> 24:08.291
Be something other than a soldier.

24:09.041 --> 24:10.291
What about you?

24:11.208 --> 24:14.791
Our mission is not over yet.
