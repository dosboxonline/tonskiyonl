WEBVTT

00:15.557 --> 00:16.558
Fuck.

00:42.626 --> 00:43.627
Come on.

01:49.860 --> 01:50.861
Okay.

02:01.955 --> 02:02.956
Oh, come on.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.470
Come on.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.373
This seat taken?

05:33.292 --> 05:34.293
No.

05:35.127 --> 05:36.753
Please, sit.

05:41.717 --> 05:43.010
You are one brave man.

05:43.719 --> 05:44.719
How's that?

05:44.720 --> 05:46.972
We mostly use Maeve's biscuits
for counterweights.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.099
Two friends of mine lost teeth
trying to bite into them.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.728
My wife's always trying to get me
to chew my food more.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.771
It was good exercise.

05:57.274 --> 05:59.650
So, what are you gonna do now?

05:59.651 --> 06:01.777
I'll do what I can to get some answers.

06:01.778 --> 06:02.905
Down here?

06:03.572 --> 06:05.948
- Are you even sheriff anymore?
- Until I'm told otherwise.

06:05.949 --> 06:08.618
So basically, you're hiding out?

06:08.619 --> 06:09.703
No.

06:12.956 --> 06:14.041
Maybe.

06:15.876 --> 06:19.087
Well, in the meantime,
why don't you do something useful?

06:20.464 --> 06:21.756
Help us.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.258
As far as the Pact allows.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.551
I got a question for you.

06:25.552 --> 06:30.014
What does the Pact say about people
who stab someone in the heart

06:30.015 --> 06:31.432
and try to pin it on others?

06:31.433 --> 06:33.684
- I need proof that--
- Give me a fucking break.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.312
You know it'll never be proven.

06:36.355 --> 06:39.607
The mayor and Sims,
they'll be laughing their heads off

06:39.608 --> 06:41.860
at your pitiful attempt
to bring them to justice.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.989
While Walker, Knox and I
swing from the bridge to Judicial.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.449
The Founders established a process,

06:48.450 --> 06:50.409
- a due process.
- The Founders?

06:50.410 --> 06:54.830
Have you ever considered
that the Founders,

06:54.831 --> 06:56.457
whoever the fuck they were,

06:56.458 --> 06:59.502
were lying through their teeth
about everything?

06:59.503 --> 07:00.963
No.

07:02.005 --> 07:03.090
No.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.808
If we don't respect the order of things,
then it all falls apart.

07:14.601 --> 07:17.436
The Pact is what we have.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.731
Those are the words we live by.

07:20.399 --> 07:25.779
There comes a time you need to stand up
and call bullshit.

07:42.588 --> 07:43.589
All right.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.528
Hey, who the fuck are you?

08:07.112 --> 08:08.113
Lukas Kyle.

08:09.364 --> 08:11.616
The shadow to the head of IT.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.367
Holland doesn't have a shadow.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.660
Meaning you can fuck off.

08:14.661 --> 08:18.582
- Oh, no. I have a--
- Hey, that was us being nice.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.668
Do you want it to go the other direction?

08:24.713 --> 08:25.796
It's blue.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.257
Yeah, I know colors.

08:28.800 --> 08:29.800
What are you doing here?

08:29.801 --> 08:33.596
Mayor Holland asked me to find something
in the judge's apartment.

08:33.597 --> 08:35.681
- What?
- I can't tell you.

08:35.682 --> 08:39.352
Judge Sims ordered us to pack everything
and bring it to Judicial.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.647
I don't know what you're gonna tell him,

08:43.315 --> 08:47.069
but I need to be alone.

08:49.613 --> 08:50.614
Now.

10:12.446 --> 10:15.156
So what are you gonna do?
Saw your way up again?

10:15.157 --> 10:16.991
No, we're gonna go late.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.911
Up the far side, in those chairs
Jules and Coop used on the generator.

10:19.912 --> 10:21.370
And somehow,

10:21.371 --> 10:24.749
by breaking into Medical Supply
without getting noticed,

10:24.750 --> 10:28.085
without getting your asses burned,
you'll magically make things okay?

10:28.086 --> 10:29.587
We're running low on everything, Walk.

10:29.588 --> 10:32.256
We're down to tearing up rags
for bandages,

10:32.257 --> 10:34.050
using rotgut for anesthesia.

10:34.051 --> 10:35.510
If your daughter were here,

10:35.511 --> 10:36.928
she'd tell these knuckleheads

10:36.929 --> 10:38.721
they're insane
to go through with this plan.

10:38.722 --> 10:41.390
- Can you come up with a better idea?
- Damn right I can.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.684
You don't need to get to Supply
to get bandages.

10:43.685 --> 10:46.104
You need to get McLain back,
so she can get bandages.

10:46.688 --> 10:50.858
Getting McLain out of detention is 200%
more difficult than breaking into Supply.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.777
I don't give a shit about the odds.

10:52.778 --> 10:54.321
We should at least try.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.448
She sacrificed herself
for our sorry asses.

10:57.449 --> 10:58.950
That should count for something.

10:58.951 --> 11:01.703
- Of course it does. But--
- Don't give me any fucking buts.

11:02.454 --> 11:03.913
You go ahead and do this thing,

11:03.914 --> 11:06.457
get yourselves arrested or maybe killed.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.625
And guess what?

11:07.626 --> 11:10.169
McLain's still locked up,
and we're doubly fucked.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.754
Walk, it's just that we have
to go about this--

11:11.755 --> 11:14.215
Do you know what?
Get the hell out of my shop.

11:14.216 --> 11:17.885
Go play your stupid game someplace else.
I got real work to do.

11:17.886 --> 11:20.138
- Come on, Walk!
- You heard me. Out.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.235
We all know how much McLain
means to you, Walk.

11:34.278 --> 11:35.279
Go!

11:54.339 --> 11:56.049
You gotta be kidding.

12:46.642 --> 12:49.393
Two of my men
were boxing up Meadows's apartment

12:49.394 --> 12:54.107
when Lukas Kyle, that little shit you
and I sent to the mines, barges in,

12:55.275 --> 12:57.318
flashes his new blue ID,

12:57.319 --> 12:59.112
says he's there on Bernard's behalf.

12:59.905 --> 13:01.156
What's he doing?

13:02.449 --> 13:03.450
I don't know.

13:03.951 --> 13:06.995
And even if I did, I couldn't tell you.

13:08.205 --> 13:10.290
Last I looked, you work for Judicial.

13:11.708 --> 13:16.338
And since I am Judge Sims,
that means you work for me.

13:17.714 --> 13:18.715
Come on, Rob.

13:19.341 --> 13:20.425
When you had my job,

13:20.926 --> 13:22.719
did you report to Judge Meadows,

13:23.387 --> 13:24.721
other than on paper?

13:33.689 --> 13:34.981
Walk!

13:34.982 --> 13:37.401
Wait. Hey, stop.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.404
- Where are you going?
- None of your business.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.530
Actually, it is.

13:42.531 --> 13:45.825
'Cause if you're going more
than ten levels, you need protection.

13:45.826 --> 13:47.494
I had a message on my computer.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.287
They shut down messaging.

13:49.288 --> 13:50.746
Well, they opened it up for me.

13:50.747 --> 13:51.998
Who did?

13:51.999 --> 13:53.457
Groundwater Removal.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.918
There's a request for a service call.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.962
The pump on 90 isn't working.

13:57.963 --> 14:00.381
Last time I overhauled that,
you were still in diapers.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.883
Walk, it's a trap.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.135
I'm guaranteed safe passage.

14:04.136 --> 14:07.638
For someone who they said is connected
to a conspiracy to murder the judge?

14:07.639 --> 14:10.725
They said pump maintenance
supersedes everything.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.060
I still think it's a trap.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.647
Well, if they throw me in a cell,
maybe they'll put me in with Carla.

14:16.481 --> 14:19.860
At least I'll have a few hours away
from all of you and your stupid plans.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.960
- What?
- I have some questions.

15:18.961 --> 15:20.045
Good for you.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.342
No, no.

15:30.013 --> 15:32.890
Look, tell your boss he'll have his wool
before the next cleaning, okay?

15:32.891 --> 15:35.561
Okay. Ma'am,
this has nothing to do with wool.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.730
It's about something of vital importance
to the Silo.

15:39.731 --> 15:40.941
You mean like wool?

15:41.608 --> 15:43.193
It's about Salvador Quinn.

15:44.236 --> 15:45.612
Don't know anyone by that name.

15:47.322 --> 15:50.950
Okay, well,
does Terrance Penbrook live here?

15:50.951 --> 15:54.328
That's my father-in-law,
but he's up at the farms right now so...

15:54.329 --> 15:56.622
Okay. Well, your father-in-law
is a direct descendant

15:56.623 --> 15:58.292
- of Salvador--
- Who's there, Josey?

15:59.626 --> 16:00.627
He's from IT.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.797
Says he needs to talk to you
about Salvador Quinn.

16:05.132 --> 16:08.093
What do you need to know about that
fucking bastard you don't know already?

16:09.219 --> 16:11.012
Sir, could I just come in? It--

16:11.013 --> 16:13.681
No, I gotta see to the sheep.
I'm already late.

16:13.682 --> 16:18.854
Sir, I don't think
you got a close look at this,

16:19.521 --> 16:21.023
at what color it is.

16:22.399 --> 16:26.361
You want to be hauled upstairs
for an official interrogation?

16:31.241 --> 16:32.326
Thank you.

16:36.705 --> 16:38.956
You make the wool for the cleanings, huh?

16:38.957 --> 16:41.877
Yes, sir. Four generations.

16:42.461 --> 16:44.295
Brandon here will be the fifth.

16:44.296 --> 16:46.088
Of course, we do more than that.

16:46.089 --> 16:49.300
We also make blankets,
mostly for Up-Toppers.

16:49.301 --> 16:50.384
What do you want?

16:50.385 --> 16:54.472
There's property that's missing
from the archives in IT,

16:54.473 --> 16:56.849
property which Mr. Quinn
took without authority

16:56.850 --> 17:00.437
and that we believe
is still in his descendants' possession.

17:02.648 --> 17:03.899
Don't know anything about that.

17:04.691 --> 17:05.692
No.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.819
No papers...

17:10.571 --> 17:11.865
relics...

17:12.782 --> 17:14.326
- books?
- Books?

17:15.368 --> 17:17.662
All the books were destroyed
in the rebellion.

17:17.663 --> 17:20.206
And why the hell would we keep
anything of his anyway?

17:20.207 --> 17:24.794
The name "Salvador Quinn" has brought
this family only shame and dishonor.

17:24.795 --> 17:29.383
I believe you and I wish that
that were enough,

17:31.051 --> 17:33.845
but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call
for a Judicial search team.

17:33.846 --> 17:36.430
- What? No, we don't have anything.
- Hey, just a minute.

17:36.431 --> 17:41.603
Okay, well, then maybe you should
just do a thorough search to make sure.

17:42.187 --> 17:44.522
I'm gonna get a coffee
and then I'll be back.

17:44.523 --> 17:46.942
Oh, come on. We don't have anything.

17:59.371 --> 18:00.622
Hey!

18:03.125 --> 18:04.585
Can I give you some advice?

18:05.085 --> 18:06.836
Sir, as I explained to you--

18:06.837 --> 18:09.715
You haven't had that badge very long,
have you?

18:11.300 --> 18:14.635
I see you trying so hard
to be a tough guy,

18:14.636 --> 18:17.306
but it ain't you.

18:18.849 --> 18:20.517
Real tough guys,

18:21.310 --> 18:23.270
they hardly say anything at all.

18:26.273 --> 18:28.400
We don't talk about Salvador Quinn.

18:30.068 --> 18:32.862
My family got rid of that name
a long time ago.

18:32.863 --> 18:33.946
Okay.

18:33.947 --> 18:38.660
Do you know why we make the wool
for the cleanings?

18:39.244 --> 18:40.453
No, why?

18:40.454 --> 18:44.457
140 years and we are still trying
to make up

18:44.458 --> 18:48.420
for being related to the man
who almost destroyed the Silo.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.474
<i>Quinn's legacy of failure continues.</i>

19:01.099 --> 19:02.684
His family were no help.

19:03.227 --> 19:06.813
Salvador Quinn was not a failure.

19:07.689 --> 19:11.108
He let the rebels erase the servers
and burn the books.

19:11.109 --> 19:15.364
That's what we've been taught,
but it's not the truth.

19:17.115 --> 19:19.743
Salvador Quinn saved the Silo.

19:20.661 --> 19:24.623
Before him, there were rebellions
every 20 years or so.

19:25.791 --> 19:28.918
And every rebellion risked
the opening of the air lock

19:28.919 --> 19:30.963
and the death of 10,000 people.

19:32.047 --> 19:34.675
Quinn realized that part of the problem

19:35.217 --> 19:38.762
was that people knew
about the rebellions that had come before,

19:39.429 --> 19:44.309
so he came up with a radical solution:
sever the Silo from its history.

19:45.018 --> 19:47.020
He cut off access to the servers,

19:47.813 --> 19:49.398
confiscated the books,

19:50.858 --> 19:52.525
then blamed the rebels.

19:52.526 --> 19:55.444
Then how did no one know that
that's what he'd done?

19:55.445 --> 19:57.906
- Surely there was someone--
- He put something in the water.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.032
A chemical compound.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.286
A drug to make us forget.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.662
Not all at once.

20:04.663 --> 20:08.667
Over the course of weeks
and months and years.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.880
And the consequence of this...

20:14.715 --> 20:17.301
was 140 years of peace.

20:20.888 --> 20:21.972
Until now.

20:52.503 --> 20:53.587
Holy shit.

20:54.588 --> 20:56.590
That tastes like my brother's armpit.

20:58.717 --> 21:01.928
I won't ask how you know
what your brother's armpits taste like,

21:01.929 --> 21:03.721
but you still need to drink it.

21:03.722 --> 21:05.056
What's in it anyway?

21:05.057 --> 21:08.392
It's an old recipe passed down
from generation to generation

21:08.393 --> 21:10.394
since maybe even the before times.

21:10.395 --> 21:13.232
You and your husband seem to know
a lot about the before times.

21:19.821 --> 21:20.822
How's that?

21:21.823 --> 21:22.908
He showed me that page...

21:25.202 --> 21:26.203
with all the trees...

21:27.996 --> 21:29.122
all the green.

21:35.629 --> 21:36.755
What did you think of it?

21:37.923 --> 21:39.341
It was something.

21:41.134 --> 21:42.469
Yeah, it was something.

21:59.778 --> 22:00.821
Hey!

22:01.530 --> 22:04.533
I don't know where you are
and I don't care, okay?

22:05.325 --> 22:07.953
But the man you took has something I need.

22:18.130 --> 22:19.131
Stop!

22:22.759 --> 22:24.594
The man you took
has something that I need!

22:24.595 --> 22:25.761
- I killed him--
- What?

22:25.762 --> 22:27.722
And I'll kill you too
if you don't go away.

22:27.723 --> 22:30.601
No. Listen, let me talk to him please.

22:31.226 --> 22:32.644
I warned you.

23:06.929 --> 23:08.638
Hi there, stranger.

23:08.639 --> 23:09.931
Camille.

23:09.932 --> 23:12.266
Coffee, when you
get a chance, please. Black.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.185
Sure thing.

23:13.769 --> 23:16.103
So, you must be in the deep of it.

23:16.104 --> 23:17.522
Burning both ends.

23:17.523 --> 23:19.024
Pretty much 24/7.

23:19.566 --> 23:20.859
Tough on Marcy, I'll bet.

23:21.818 --> 23:23.946
Yeah, I know all about those hours.

23:25.322 --> 23:28.491
Wasn't easy wondering
when Rob was coming home.

23:28.492 --> 23:29.952
If he was gonna come home.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.580
Marcy doesn't complain too much.

23:34.748 --> 23:37.626
I remember when you two
came over for dinner.

23:38.293 --> 23:39.461
You were just dating.

23:40.212 --> 23:42.129
Yeah, I knew right then
she was made of strong stuff.

23:42.130 --> 23:43.507
That she is.

23:44.508 --> 23:47.552
You know that was the first time
Rob ever asked one of his agents over?

23:47.553 --> 23:50.013
And now what?
You already have a child on the way.

23:50.514 --> 23:51.681
Due in two months.

23:51.682 --> 23:52.975
That is wonderful.

23:53.976 --> 23:54.810
A blessing.

23:55.936 --> 23:59.857
And yet, I'm afraid for our children.

24:01.859 --> 24:04.236
- I'm not sure I follow.
- Things are out of control.

24:04.778 --> 24:06.404
You more than anyone can see that.

24:06.405 --> 24:08.030
We're gonna have everything
sorted out soon.

24:08.031 --> 24:09.657
It's those damn greasers
from down deep that--

24:09.658 --> 24:11.368
They're not making things any easier.

24:12.953 --> 24:14.663
But isn't the real problem in IT?

24:16.248 --> 24:17.958
No, I don't think so.

24:18.709 --> 24:21.294
The mayor's new shadow is some guy

24:21.295 --> 24:24.089
who a minute ago was busting rocks
in the mines

24:24.673 --> 24:26.758
and we're seconds
from an all-out rebellion.

24:27.384 --> 24:31.262
- Bernard knows what he's doing.
- I hope so, but people are having doubts.

24:31.263 --> 24:34.224
On all levels, not just the lower ones.

24:35.225 --> 24:39.229
I'm just doing my job,
like your husband's just doing his.

24:43.567 --> 24:45.444
We're all gonna die if we're not careful.

24:46.195 --> 24:48.863
My husband has the best interests
of the Silo in his heart.

24:48.864 --> 24:50.073
You have to believe that.

24:51.992 --> 24:55.287
He needs you to find out
what Bernard's shadow is up to.

24:56.371 --> 24:57.664
Even if I were to help...

25:00.083 --> 25:01.960
- if Bernard were to find out--
- One thing.

25:03.795 --> 25:05.297
One thing is all he's asking.

25:06.340 --> 25:09.218
- Track Lukas Kyle.
- I swore an oath, Camille.

25:10.093 --> 25:12.470
Like we all did. Judge Sims included.

25:12.471 --> 25:14.139
You didn't just swear an oath to one man.

25:15.724 --> 25:17.017
You swore it to the Silo.

25:17.976 --> 25:19.728
And right now, the Silo needs your help.

25:21.980 --> 25:22.980
I have to go.

25:22.981 --> 25:24.274
I'm sorry.

25:51.301 --> 25:52.344
Mr. Mayor.

25:53.554 --> 25:55.264
I heard the pump needs fixing.

25:56.306 --> 25:57.432
Not anymore.

26:02.437 --> 26:03.688
That was easy.

26:03.689 --> 26:05.190
I heard you wanted to see me.

26:06.650 --> 26:07.985
What gave you that idea?

26:08.569 --> 26:11.112
You turned your camera back on,
for one thing.

26:11.113 --> 26:12.197
That...

26:13.323 --> 26:14.449
That was a mistake.

26:15.158 --> 26:18.703
Well, see, I took it as an invitation.

26:18.704 --> 26:22.707
To what? To shoot the shit,
'cause we're such good buddies and all?

26:22.708 --> 26:24.251
All that, yes.

26:24.835 --> 26:29.673
But what I was really hoping for
was the chance to negotiate.

26:57.910 --> 26:59.036
Come on.

28:34.173 --> 28:36.091
I tried eating the fruit off this tree.

28:36.967 --> 28:38.051
Bitter as shit.

28:38.802 --> 28:41.555
Guess it fits,
since my old man was a nasty bastard.

28:43.807 --> 28:46.351
I ran a track-and-trace on Lukas Kyle.

28:46.894 --> 28:48.394
I appreciate that very much.

28:48.395 --> 28:50.730
He went from Judge Meadows's place
to an apartment in lower-mids

28:50.731 --> 28:52.815
occupied by Terrance Penbrook.

28:52.816 --> 28:54.650
- Then he went to Bernard's office.
- What was he doing?

28:54.651 --> 28:56.819
Looking for something. A book.

28:56.820 --> 28:58.447
Belonged to Salvador Quinn.

28:59.281 --> 29:01.032
- What book?
- I don't know.

29:01.033 --> 29:02.116
I don't think he knows.

29:02.117 --> 29:03.618
Where is he now?

29:03.619 --> 29:05.536
On the stairs, headed down.

29:05.537 --> 29:07.163
Well, let me know
where he is when he gets--

29:07.164 --> 29:08.414
No.

29:08.415 --> 29:10.751
And stop sending your wife
asking for favors.

29:12.044 --> 29:15.714
I did this for you, Judge Sims,
this one time...

29:17.716 --> 29:19.009
'cause I owe you that.

29:20.344 --> 29:22.638
But we are done.

29:37.402 --> 29:40.029
She's a stubborn one, your McLain.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.615
And then some.

29:42.241 --> 29:45.285
But detention isn't easy for most,

29:45.953 --> 29:47.579
especially someone her age.

29:48.997 --> 29:51.040
I don't know how long she can hold out.

29:51.041 --> 29:52.708
So, let her go.

29:52.709 --> 29:54.418
- Well--
- No, I'm serious.

29:54.419 --> 29:57.129
What are you doing messing around
with a couple of old ladies

29:57.130 --> 29:59.841
who just happened to be
in the wrong place at the wrong time?

29:59.842 --> 30:01.050
Come now.

30:01.051 --> 30:03.470
You know very well that is not the case.

30:04.680 --> 30:08.099
Well, I'm guessing
if you really knew something,

30:08.100 --> 30:10.018
you wouldn't need
to dick around like this.

30:10.727 --> 30:13.396
I think you don't know what to do
or where to start

30:13.397 --> 30:16.649
and you're just taking shots in the dark
and hoping you'll hit something.

30:16.650 --> 30:19.361
I'm trying to save the Silo, Martha.

30:20.529 --> 30:22.905
And I am forced to go
to any lengths to do it.

30:22.906 --> 30:24.824
Well, bully for you.

30:24.825 --> 30:29.370
What Mechanical is doing,
to put it bluntly, will get us all killed.

30:29.371 --> 30:30.788
So you say.

30:30.789 --> 30:35.043
I do say, and I also say
that before I let that happen,

30:35.878 --> 30:37.753
your wife will suffer more pain

30:37.754 --> 30:40.132
than she ever thought could exist
in this life.

30:40.757 --> 30:42.050
She won't die

30:42.593 --> 30:46.721
but she will be pleading to the Founders
to let her die.

30:46.722 --> 30:48.098
Please don't.

30:49.308 --> 30:51.059
Not to be overly dramatic,

30:52.769 --> 30:56.732
but her life is in your hands.

30:59.234 --> 31:00.693
What do you want?

31:00.694 --> 31:05.031
If I had someone
that could tell me in advance

31:05.032 --> 31:08.784
just what it is your little band of rebels
is planning,

31:08.785 --> 31:13.165
then I might have a shot
of getting things back to normal.

31:16.793 --> 31:18.045
Hey.

31:19.838 --> 31:21.798
- Hey.
- Where's Claire?

31:22.424 --> 31:25.135
- Asleep.
- Damn, it's that late already?

31:29.598 --> 31:30.641
Everything okay?

31:36.563 --> 31:37.773
No, actually.

31:39.483 --> 31:40.526
What?

31:42.152 --> 31:43.319
What happened?

31:43.320 --> 31:45.155
I took some food to Patrick Kennedy today.

31:46.823 --> 31:48.115
Okay.

31:48.116 --> 31:51.703
You showed him a page from a book
made in the before times.

31:52.704 --> 31:53.872
Is that true?

31:55.582 --> 31:58.084
I should have known
he couldn't keep it to himself.

31:58.085 --> 31:59.253
Is it true?

32:00.712 --> 32:03.130
- Yes.
- And you show it to him and not me?

32:03.131 --> 32:04.715
I shouldn't have shown it to anyone

32:04.716 --> 32:06.717
but I needed to convince him
to tell me what he need--

32:06.718 --> 32:08.345
I don't care why!

32:08.971 --> 32:11.389
Why would you hold back
on sharing something

32:11.390 --> 32:14.392
- as important as that with me?
- Because it's dangerous.

32:14.393 --> 32:16.645
I don't care how dangerous it is!

32:22.150 --> 32:23.610
Is it true...

32:25.696 --> 32:29.783
that there was a world outside
that was beautiful?

32:34.162 --> 32:35.539
Show it to me.

32:37.165 --> 32:39.042
- Kathleen, you--
- Show it to me!

33:11.158 --> 33:14.244
There is a whole book of pictures.

33:17.414 --> 33:18.707
People.

33:19.291 --> 33:20.417
Sky.

33:21.376 --> 33:22.669
Animals.

33:23.587 --> 33:24.755
Children.

33:29.176 --> 33:30.802
What happened, Paul?

33:31.428 --> 33:32.554
I don't know.

33:35.265 --> 33:36.433
I don't know.

33:39.478 --> 33:41.396
I don't know what to do, baby. I...

33:44.525 --> 33:45.984
I don't know what to do.

33:49.571 --> 33:51.657
I need to apologize for before.

33:53.784 --> 33:57.996
I'm trying to find out something
and it is very important, but...

33:59.998 --> 34:02.376
it doesn't excuse how I acted.

34:05.921 --> 34:07.922
The truth is I'm a kid from the lower-mids

34:07.923 --> 34:11.926
and I got lucky getting this job
and a fancy ID.

34:11.927 --> 34:13.218
And...

34:13.219 --> 34:17.558
I made the mistake of thinking
maybe I'm something special,

34:18.225 --> 34:20.643
but I'm not.

34:21.978 --> 34:22.980
Not by a long shot.

34:25.399 --> 34:28.944
Salvador Quinn, he's special.

34:29.945 --> 34:32.488
- He was a hero.
- I knew it.

34:32.489 --> 34:34.073
Don't lie to us, son.

34:34.074 --> 34:39.329
Sir, I wish I could tell you how I know,
but I can't.

34:39.955 --> 34:43.916
And it might be hard for you to trust me,
given what an asshole I was before.

34:43.917 --> 34:48.922
But I am telling you, he saved the Silo.

34:50.799 --> 34:54.344
When Judge Meadows visited us,
she tried to tell us the same thing.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.224
Judge Meadows came here?

35:00.601 --> 35:01.602
When?

35:02.394 --> 35:04.979
Years ago. Before Brandon was born.

35:04.980 --> 35:07.190
I think before she became Judge.

35:07.191 --> 35:09.401
What did she want?

35:13.488 --> 35:14.531
Books.

35:15.199 --> 35:16.574
Same as you.

35:16.575 --> 35:18.202
Didn't care if they were relics.

35:18.827 --> 35:20.870
Said we wouldn't get into any trouble.

35:20.871 --> 35:23.582
She had a blue ID, like you.

35:24.208 --> 35:26.709
Said she'd be willing to make an exchange.

35:26.710 --> 35:29.588
- And you--
- Brandon.

35:46.104 --> 35:49.232
What were the books you traded for these?

35:49.233 --> 35:50.317
Just one.

35:50.901 --> 35:52.485
An old copy of the Pact.

35:52.486 --> 35:53.945
It was Quinn's.

35:53.946 --> 35:55.988
At least, his name was on the inside.

35:55.989 --> 35:57.074
That's it, huh?

35:57.616 --> 35:58.825
That's all she wanted.

35:59.409 --> 36:00.619
Never saw her again.

36:02.704 --> 36:06.458
Is it true she was murdered
by a couple of Mechanicals?

36:08.001 --> 36:09.211
That's what they say.

36:10.754 --> 36:11.755
I don't know.

36:12.798 --> 36:13.799
Thank you.

36:18.345 --> 36:22.348
Take solace in knowing
that 10,000 of your fellow citizens

36:22.349 --> 36:25.143
will be grateful for your co-operation.

36:27.604 --> 36:28.897
Can I see her now?

36:29.606 --> 36:30.982
Of course.

36:30.983 --> 36:32.484
A deal's a deal.

37:39.051 --> 37:40.177
This is it.

37:41.386 --> 37:42.387
Come on.

37:43.263 --> 37:44.264
Here.

37:50.646 --> 37:52.688
- Ben, you hit the meds.
- Got it.

37:52.689 --> 37:54.066
Sarah, you hit the ba--

38:09.248 --> 38:10.457
What have you done to her?

38:11.667 --> 38:13.836
It's more what she's done to herself.

38:16.255 --> 38:17.506
Carla!

38:18.715 --> 38:19.841
Carla!

38:19.842 --> 38:21.134
She can't hear you.

38:26.473 --> 38:28.851
I said that you could see her,
and now you have.

38:29.560 --> 38:32.186
- What?
- You can see she's alive.

38:32.187 --> 38:33.938
And if you want it to stay that way,

38:33.939 --> 38:36.608
you'll continue to be my eyes and ears
in the Down Deep.

38:37.276 --> 38:39.027
What happened to a deal's a deal?

38:39.903 --> 38:41.445
I will make you this promise.

38:41.446 --> 38:45.242
No harm will come to her
if you continue to co-operate.

38:45.951 --> 38:49.413
And, once this mess is all cleaned up,

38:50.539 --> 38:54.626
you will be reunited
with your true love once again.

38:56.753 --> 38:59.047
You are quite the bastard, aren't you?

39:00.215 --> 39:01.758
Yes or no?

39:06.388 --> 39:07.806
Yes, damn it.

39:08.557 --> 39:10.767
- Yes.
- Good.

39:13.103 --> 39:14.229
And...

39:15.606 --> 39:17.441
it's not like I don't trust you...

39:18.192 --> 39:19.317
Actually, I don't.

39:19.318 --> 39:22.945
But there will be eyes and ears
in the Down Deep

39:22.946 --> 39:27.659
that will make sure
that you keep your end of the bargain.

39:28.785 --> 39:33.457
And I also need you
to turn your camera back on.

39:34.291 --> 39:37.961
And until this is over,
you will stay in your workshop.

40:05.697 --> 40:06.865
Okay.

40:27.553 --> 40:28.762
Fuck!

40:44.444 --> 40:46.780
Proceed...

40:48.490 --> 40:52.660
20 pa-pa-pac... 20 pace...

40:52.661 --> 40:55.913
20 paces for-for... Forward.

40:55.914 --> 40:59.751
Proceed 20 paces forward, then two.

41:05.924 --> 41:07.134
Page 99.

41:08.802 --> 41:09.803
Come on.

41:10.596 --> 41:11.680
Come on, Lukas.

41:27.237 --> 41:31.074
"If you've gotten this far,
you already know the game is rigged."

41:41.919 --> 41:44.295
You kicked my agents
out of this apartment.

41:44.296 --> 41:46.339
- What's in the bag?
- You can't touch me.

41:46.340 --> 41:48.258
I'm Bernard Holland's shadow.

41:49.468 --> 41:52.846
You have no idea what I can do.

42:01.855 --> 42:02.981
The Pact.

42:03.941 --> 42:05.441
Mayor Holland asked me to bring it to him.

42:05.442 --> 42:06.360
Why?

42:07.861 --> 42:08.946
It belonged to her.

42:11.448 --> 42:13.658
I don't pretend to know
what's in Bernard's mind,

42:13.659 --> 42:15.326
as far as you're concerned.

42:15.327 --> 42:18.496
But whatever it is, you should know,
once he gets what he needs from you,

42:18.497 --> 42:20.874
he'll throw you back to the mines.

42:25.170 --> 42:27.923
Sometime soon, you're gonna need a friend.

42:29.550 --> 42:30.883
A friend like you?

42:30.884 --> 42:33.595
You might think you know what he wants.

42:34.471 --> 42:35.973
I thought I did.

42:37.599 --> 42:39.852
But he'll always be four moves
ahead of you.

42:41.770 --> 42:42.896
Watch yourself.

42:43.605 --> 42:44.982
That's my advice.

42:46.859 --> 42:47.984
Thank you.

42:47.985 --> 42:49.735
Now, if you don't mind, I gotta go.

42:49.736 --> 42:53.949
Your mother, she works in hospice on 85,
isn't that right?

42:55.409 --> 42:59.121
I'm just guessing she'd hate
to have her son as a patient.

43:38.619 --> 43:39.745
How'd it go?

43:40.913 --> 43:42.456
Everything okay with the pump?

43:43.332 --> 43:44.583
Burnt out capacitor.

43:45.250 --> 43:46.418
It could have been worse.

43:47.794 --> 43:49.129
Couldn't be worse down here.

43:49.838 --> 43:51.256
We should have listened to you, Walk.

43:52.216 --> 43:54.593
- What about?
- Breaking into Supply.

43:56.386 --> 43:57.386
They caught 'em.

43:57.387 --> 43:59.431
Teddy and his team got arrested.

44:03.310 --> 44:04.602
Anybody killed?

44:04.603 --> 44:06.480
Honestly, we don't know.

44:07.814 --> 44:13.152
It's possible,
but we can't get any information.

44:13.153 --> 44:14.279
Shit.

44:15.030 --> 44:17.491
Knox and I aren't sure
how the raiders found out.

44:18.200 --> 44:22.287
You know, there's gotta be someone
down here, a snitch.

44:23.872 --> 44:27.376
You know, we thought we were careful,
but I guess not.

44:35.342 --> 44:36.426
You all right?

44:37.177 --> 44:38.387
Yeah, I'm just tired.

44:38.887 --> 44:40.013
It's a long walk.

44:40.722 --> 44:43.058
I don't think I'll be up for that again.

44:44.643 --> 44:45.978
Did you see something?

44:46.979 --> 44:48.689
People freaking the fuck out.

44:50.023 --> 44:52.191
Raiders on every level,
armed to the teeth,

44:52.192 --> 44:54.527
waiting for someone
to make the wrong move.

44:54.528 --> 44:57.281
- That's it?
- Yeah. That's not enough for you?

45:00.367 --> 45:04.246
Look, I'm sorry, I'm just beat.

45:04.955 --> 45:07.331
- Can I get you something?
- No, I'm just...

45:07.332 --> 45:09.168
Look, I just need a rest, okay?

45:09.668 --> 45:10.669
Thank you.

45:16.383 --> 45:17.551
Okay.

45:19.303 --> 45:20.387
Well...

45:22.639 --> 45:25.100
- You know where to find me.
- Always.

46:18.362 --> 46:19.363
Hey!

46:27.329 --> 46:28.413
Wait! Wai--

46:31.124 --> 46:32.125
No!

46:44.304 --> 46:45.305
Hey!

46:49.601 --> 46:51.894
I already put one arrow in your shoulder.

46:51.895 --> 46:54.273
One more move and this one
goes straight into your heart.
