WEBVTT

00:10.344 --> 00:12.553
<i>Devon!</i>

00:12.554 --> 00:16.264
<i>No, no, no. Listen,
we're not happy. We're miserable.</i>

00:16.265 --> 00:18.309
<i>Burt!</i>

00:18.310 --> 00:19.977
<i>They torture us down there!</i>

00:19.978 --> 00:21.062
<i>Devon!</i>

00:21.063 --> 00:22.897
- <i>We're prisoners!</i>
- <i>Burt!</i>

00:22.898 --> 00:24.399
<i>She's alive!</i>

03:39.344 --> 03:40.971
I suppose you're Mark S.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.975
- I--
- I'm Mark W.

03:48.770 --> 03:49.771
Who are you people?

03:53.442 --> 03:55.568
Would you be open to
using a different first name

03:55.569 --> 03:57.112
to avoid confusion?

03:58.572 --> 04:00.365
Welcome back, Mark S.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.121
Been a minute.

04:14.838 --> 04:15.880
Where are they?

04:15.881 --> 04:17.965
I think it's best
to save any queries

04:17.966 --> 04:19.842
till we arrive at the management office.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.093
Were they fired?

04:21.094 --> 04:24.180
You can leave the balloons
in the foyer by my old desk.

04:24.181 --> 04:27.767
We've much to discuss,
and I don't want them distracting you.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.268
I assure you, they won't be taken.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.436
Mr. Milchick, please.

04:30.437 --> 04:32.230
What you all did five months ago

04:32.231 --> 04:34.982
was one of the most painful moments
in the history of this company.

04:34.983 --> 04:35.900
Five months?

04:35.901 --> 04:37.944
I, too, was wounded by it.

04:37.945 --> 04:42.573
But we must be cut to heal, mustn't we?

04:42.574 --> 04:44.450
Wait, did you say your old office?

04:44.451 --> 04:45.868
Mark, this is Miss Huang.

04:45.869 --> 04:47.453
Miss Huang, Mark S.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.539
Hello.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.834
She'll be happy to mind your balloons
while we chat.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.378
Right this way, Mark.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.176
You can shut it.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.180
Is it normal for a child to--

05:06.181 --> 05:07.683
Excuse the clutter.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.858
Okay. What's happening?

05:17.693 --> 05:19.778
Ms. Cobel is no longer with this company.

05:20.612 --> 05:22.197
I now manage the severed floor.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.658
What about my team?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.369
We didn't fire them.

05:29.288 --> 05:33.082
Helly R. and Irving B. both successfully
made contact with persons on the outside,

05:33.083 --> 05:34.334
just as you did.

05:35.043 --> 05:38.005
Dylan G.'s outie learned what happened
after the fact.

05:38.922 --> 05:42.301
The four of you
have achieved international fame.

05:43.594 --> 05:47.471
As a group, you've become known
as the face of severance reform.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.474
- Severance ref--
- Have a seat, Mark.

05:50.225 --> 05:53.394
Shortly before your mutiny,
we installed security doors

05:53.395 --> 05:54.980
to keep you in MDR.

05:55.731 --> 05:59.860
This accompanied a punitive rendition
of the Kier hymn performed by Ms. Cobel.

06:00.611 --> 06:01.695
Do you recall?

06:03.030 --> 06:04.031
I do.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.664
I locked you in a room
like an animal, Mark.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.082
As an unsevered man,

06:15.083 --> 06:17.503
I'll carry that knowledge
the rest of my life.

06:19.796 --> 06:20.963
But for the past five months,

06:20.964 --> 06:23.966
we've been asking how a sadist
like Harmony Cobel

06:23.967 --> 06:26.553
could take fertile root in Lumon soil.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.555
And what that says about us.

06:30.849 --> 06:34.393
We also know Ms. Cobel
was at your sister's home

06:34.394 --> 06:35.854
when you awoke there.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.691
Yeah. Why was that?

06:40.776 --> 06:43.237
We believe she'd developed
an erotic fixation on you

06:43.862 --> 06:46.155
and had plans to pursue both you
and your outie

06:46.156 --> 06:48.075
in what might be termed "a throuple."

06:50.077 --> 06:51.078
What?

06:51.620 --> 06:53.539
Thankfully, she failed at this.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.211
You still haven't told me
where my team is.

07:02.798 --> 07:04.883
We tried for weeks to get them back, Mark.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.719
None of them agreed.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.933
We told them of the reforms,
but it wasn't enough.

07:15.644 --> 07:16.645
Except for me?

07:20.023 --> 07:21.859
Your outie insisted on returning.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.445
In fact, he begged us to let him back
right away.

07:28.323 --> 07:31.994
So the others, they refused?

07:33.996 --> 07:34.997
Yes.

07:37.708 --> 07:41.128
Well, I'd like to hear it from them.

07:46.758 --> 07:48.135
That's not possible.

07:57.060 --> 07:58.353
Enjoy your balloons.

08:19.917 --> 08:23.211
Yeah. We showed up
about an hour before you did.

08:23.212 --> 08:26.172
It's a little cramped
compared to our old MDR,

08:26.173 --> 08:27.673
but I love the green carpet.

08:27.674 --> 08:30.259
Ours was a crème brûlée
and the keyboards were puce.

08:30.260 --> 08:31.177
They were purple.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.763
No. They were puce.
I know because it makes me nauseous,

08:33.764 --> 08:34.931
and I hate sweets.

08:34.932 --> 08:38.059
Speaking of which, how much do we see
of that Mr. "Milkshake"?

08:38.977 --> 08:40.101
Milchick.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.020
What?

08:42.606 --> 08:46.943
It's Milchick, not milkshake.
And I don't know.

08:46.944 --> 08:51.280
Marco, where I can find some ink pencils?

08:51.281 --> 08:52.366
Supply closet.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.331
I'll show ya.

09:05.128 --> 09:09.424
- So, did you really see the outie world?
- Yeah.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.592
How's the sky?

09:11.593 --> 09:12.761
I don't know.

09:13.554 --> 09:16.138
- What, you didn't see it?
- Well, I went outside for a second,

09:16.139 --> 09:18.559
but I was distracted by my brother-in-law.

09:19.685 --> 09:20.685
Seriously?

09:20.686 --> 09:23.521
Because we made a list of
what we'd most like to see on the outside.

09:23.522 --> 09:26.023
And sky was an easy number one.

09:26.024 --> 09:28.442
Brothers-in-law weren't even on the list.

09:28.443 --> 09:29.403
<i>Grazie.</i>

09:30.153 --> 09:31.863
Could you tell what state we were in?

09:31.864 --> 09:34.615
Because three of us put Wyoming
on our input survey.

09:34.616 --> 09:35.992
- Did you see any buttes?
- No.

09:35.993 --> 09:36.993
Oh, my God. How's wind?

09:36.994 --> 09:38.661
Is it just like getting breathed on,
kind of?

09:38.662 --> 09:40.162
Hello, Refiners.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.706
Hello, Miss Huang.

09:41.707 --> 09:43.959
Oh, no. It's the ball game.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.129
Let's head to the kitchenette.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.729
Okay. So,

10:04.313 --> 10:05.480
my name is Miss Huang.

10:06.148 --> 10:09.193
It's my first day here as deputy manager.

10:10.027 --> 10:16.408
I guess something about me is that
before this, I was a crossing guard.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.543
Mark W.?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.795
Why are you a child?

10:31.465 --> 10:33.175
Because of when I was born.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.598
Right. I'm Mark W.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.351
I'm from the MDR department of branch 5X,

10:43.352 --> 10:45.354
where I worked with Gwendolyn Y.

10:47.314 --> 10:51.234
Kind of a fun fact about me is that
I thought I'd be permanently retired

10:51.235 --> 10:52.986
when my branch shut down.

10:54.071 --> 10:55.781
So this is a nice surprise.

10:57.908 --> 10:59.034
Mark S.?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.246
Okay.

11:16.802 --> 11:18.011
I'm Mark S.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.809
And I've been here about two years.

11:29.398 --> 11:30.649
Something about me...

11:43.453 --> 11:44.746
is...

11:49.751 --> 11:54.173
that I am lucky enough
to have made four new friends today.

11:55.841 --> 11:56.925
That's nice, Mark.

11:57.843 --> 12:00.179
But I have to remind you
that I'm a supervisor,

12:01.471 --> 12:02.556
not a friend.

12:22.075 --> 12:23.744
Three new friends.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.250
Okay.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.213
Congratulations to our two Marks. And now...

13:31.687 --> 13:33.396
What's your perpetuity wing like?

13:33.397 --> 13:35.524
- Do the Eagans move?
- No.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.901
Probably because it's an older branch.

13:38.902 --> 13:40.486
Ours were animatronic.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.530
They even did
this little choreographed dance.

13:42.531 --> 13:45.741
So yours just stand there? That's weird.

13:45.742 --> 13:48.995
In my first
perpetuity wing, the Eagans were brooms.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.080
Brooms?

13:50.581 --> 13:52.915
- Each with a face made of a plate.
- A plate?

13:52.916 --> 13:53.959
We were very poor.

13:54.543 --> 13:56.419
Did you guys have the CPR dummies?

13:56.420 --> 13:58.963
- Yeah.
- What were those made of?

13:58.964 --> 14:01.174
- Brooms.
- Did you have an elevator?

14:01.175 --> 14:04.468
We had-- How do you say a rope.

14:04.469 --> 14:05.637
Jesus.

14:22.154 --> 14:24.071
I'm heading out. You good?

14:24.072 --> 14:26.824
Yep. Just about to close out.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.118
Good. Thank you.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.831
You know, my old team
was a bunch of dirtbags.

14:36.418 --> 14:39.213
We never hit quota. Not once.

14:43.133 --> 14:45.344
But it seems like you really liked yours.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.390
So, I'm sorry.

14:58.273 --> 14:59.274
Good night, Mark.

14:59.900 --> 15:00.901
Good night.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.396
Hey, everybody.

15:38.397 --> 15:39.523
"Dear Outie,

15:40.816 --> 15:43.818
I don't know if this will reach you,
but I'm writing to alert you

15:43.819 --> 15:46.112
of the heinous conditions
in the severed office

15:46.113 --> 15:48.073
to which you have transferred me.

15:48.782 --> 15:53.871
The branch is run by a shambolic rube
who goes by Milkshake."

15:54.413 --> 15:55.580
Oh, my God.

15:55.581 --> 16:00.711
"A man whose stupidity is rivaled
only by that of the nine core principles.

16:01.336 --> 16:05.590
If you must continue to send me here,
please consider strapping a bomb to me,

16:05.591 --> 16:11.138
so that I may explode both Milkshake
and the very spirit of Kier Eagan.

16:11.847 --> 16:15.517
Wrathfully, your innie, Mark W."

16:17.019 --> 16:20.147
Oh, my God. That's very serious.

16:22.399 --> 16:23.483
Is it earnest?

16:29.489 --> 16:31.783
Do you really think I'm a shambolic rube?

16:34.036 --> 16:35.954
Wait, you think I wrote this note?

16:37.956 --> 16:40.541
Were you going to frame all of us
or just Mark W.?

16:40.542 --> 16:44.171
Clever way to secure the name
for yourself, I suppose?

16:45.464 --> 16:49.008
- I don't know why you hate this team.
- I don't hate this team.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.595
You didn't even
disguise your own handwriting.

16:56.892 --> 16:59.353
You know what?
I don't even know who this team is.

17:00.020 --> 17:02.814
I told you. I want my team.

17:03.941 --> 17:06.484
Which part of that don't you understand?

17:11.573 --> 17:16.035
Mark S., at this time,
I revoke your status as Department Chief,

17:16.036 --> 17:19.998
which will be transferred
to your intended victim, Mark W.

17:22.667 --> 17:24.293
I accept.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.254
You will be relegated to the office

17:26.255 --> 17:29.258
and must check in regularly
as to your progress.

17:32.344 --> 17:35.430
Do you even have a brother-in-law, asshole?

17:39.852 --> 17:41.103
What's funny?

17:44.565 --> 17:47.067
You don't know what I did
to the kitchenette yet, do you?

18:02.374 --> 18:03.375
Goddamn it.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.258
Hey!

18:15.929 --> 18:17.723
You're definitely not supposed to do that.

18:21.185 --> 18:24.103
Mr. Milchick,
I've got Mark S. in your office.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.355
He's got the speaker.

18:27.191 --> 18:31.862
Hello? Is anyone there? Is the Board on?
It's Mark S. from Macrodata Refinement.

18:34.031 --> 18:36.032
Okay. Well, if you're there,
please listen.

18:36.033 --> 18:39.785
Now, I know that you want to
do the right thing for severed people,

18:39.786 --> 18:42.705
- which is why I need to see my team again.
- Mark!

18:42.706 --> 18:45.917
If we truly are the face
of severance reform, as you say,

18:45.918 --> 18:49.003
- then they deserve a chance.
- Mark!

18:49.004 --> 18:50.505
Please. They're my friends!

18:50.506 --> 18:52.841
You can't just make them disappear!
Please!

19:11.151 --> 19:14.070
Look, Mr. Milchick, I only
went to the Board because I cannot--

19:14.071 --> 19:17.074
The Board does not converse with innies.

19:19.076 --> 19:22.620
It is clear your outie's fame
has gone to your innie's head.

19:22.621 --> 19:27.668
No, my innie just wants his coworkers back
so we can serve Kier together.

19:40.264 --> 19:41.640
Are you firing me?

19:42.850 --> 19:43.851
On you go.

19:50.691 --> 19:52.776
Why can't you just bring them back?

19:54.111 --> 19:55.571
Goodbye, Mark S.

19:56.864 --> 19:57.739
Wait!

20:50.042 --> 20:51.167
- Dylan!
- Mark.

20:51.168 --> 20:52.251
- Did it work?
- It worked.

20:52.252 --> 20:53.837
- Where are the others?
- I don't know.

20:54.505 --> 20:56.714
Milchick was-- I didn't think
I was coming back.

20:56.715 --> 20:58.674
- I've been back a couple days already.
- What?

20:58.675 --> 21:00.635
Yeah. And they had a whole new team.

21:00.636 --> 21:02.303
- Cobel just replaced us?
- No.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.055
Cobel's gone. Milchick's in charge.

21:04.056 --> 21:07.558
Okay, so the man who just tackled me
and cut up my best belt is our boss now?

21:07.559 --> 21:09.143
- Fuck me.
- Wait. He tackled you?

21:09.144 --> 21:11.479
Yeah, bad. Which-- I mean, fair,
I tackled the man first,

21:11.480 --> 21:13.231
but I didn't fuck with his belt.

21:13.232 --> 21:15.359
"Kier pardons his betrayers"?

21:16.026 --> 21:18.946
Burt!

21:24.409 --> 21:25.661
Dude, are you okay?

21:45.055 --> 21:46.722
Irving, what happened?

21:46.723 --> 21:50.602
The fuck? Irv! Dude, what's wrong?
You poor up there?

21:54.773 --> 21:56.483
Come on.

22:03.824 --> 22:05.199
Helly!

22:05.200 --> 22:06.785
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

22:07.661 --> 22:09.996
I'm okay. Did you wake up?

22:09.997 --> 22:11.998
- Yeah, it was crazy.
- Same.

22:11.999 --> 22:13.541
Oh, my God. I was so worried about you.

22:13.542 --> 22:16.210
- How long has it been?
- Five months, maybe more.

22:16.211 --> 22:17.379
Where's everybody else?

22:17.880 --> 22:18.881
Come on.

22:22.676 --> 22:23.760
They're gone.

22:26.263 --> 22:27.431
Irving?

22:28.473 --> 22:29.892
He won't come out.

22:32.144 --> 22:34.187
- Hey, Irv?
- I'm sorry, Mark.

22:34.188 --> 22:36.523
I just need a moment, please.

22:37.107 --> 22:38.609
Okay. Take your time.

22:39.818 --> 22:41.903
Okay, so what is going on?
We're not in trouble?

22:41.904 --> 22:44.155
I don't think so. I mean,
Milchick said our message got out.

22:44.156 --> 22:45.698
He said we're famous.

22:45.699 --> 22:47.742
All of us equally
or one of us is, like, the star?

22:47.743 --> 22:50.745
I don't know.
But then he tried to fire me, I think.

22:50.746 --> 22:52.079
Why?

22:52.080 --> 22:55.458
Well, because I sort of
sabotaged the new people.

22:55.459 --> 22:58.628
- New people?
- So, what the fuck happened up there?

22:58.629 --> 23:00.671
Well, look, Milchick is probably coming.

23:00.672 --> 23:03.299
Good. I owe him a fucking belt cut.
Now tell me.

23:03.300 --> 23:05.551
What if they're waiting for us
to tell each other what happened

23:05.552 --> 23:07.386
because they don't know what happened?

23:07.387 --> 23:09.472
I mean, what if they're listening, Dylan?

23:09.473 --> 23:11.183
Wait, what happened
to the security camera?

23:13.477 --> 23:14.478
I--

23:15.187 --> 23:16.355
I'm sorry, I was...

23:19.399 --> 23:20.400
just--

23:23.695 --> 23:24.988
Are you okay?

23:25.906 --> 23:28.992
Hi, everyone. I'm Miss Huang.

23:31.411 --> 23:33.789
Mr. Milchick's waiting for you
in the break room.

23:41.213 --> 23:43.631
What the fuck is going on?
Why is she, like, eight?

23:43.632 --> 23:44.800
I don't know.

23:45.634 --> 23:46.926
Wait, so they replaced us?

23:46.927 --> 23:48.094
For a couple days.

23:48.095 --> 23:49.178
Who was me?

23:49.179 --> 23:51.347
They weren't, like, specific counterparts.

23:51.348 --> 23:53.766
They were, I don't know, weird.

23:53.767 --> 23:55.643
Okay. Well,
I don't think you should feel bad at all.

23:55.644 --> 23:58.521
- Feel bad?
- Yeah, for ending their lives. Fuck 'em.

23:58.522 --> 24:00.064
Well, I wasn't trying to--

24:00.065 --> 24:01.732
No, dude,
I'm saying don't feel bad.

24:01.733 --> 24:03.235
Like, I'm sure they deserved it.

25:28.403 --> 25:32.324
Macrodata Refinement. Welcome back.

25:34.326 --> 25:36.286
Please, take a seat.

25:36.995 --> 25:40.207
Irving, if you wouldn't mind
being in back.

25:41.166 --> 25:42.751
Tall glass of water.

25:45.462 --> 25:47.881
I guess the Board reconsidered my terms.

25:49.550 --> 25:50.551
Guess so.

25:54.805 --> 25:58.391
What you're about to see will be shown
to every innie who sets foot

25:58.392 --> 26:00.227
in this building after today.

26:01.353 --> 26:04.022
I hope it will give you
a sense of Lumon's feelings.

26:22.124 --> 26:26.252
<i>Hi. You probably don't recognize me
from this angle.</i>

26:26.253 --> 26:30.006
<i>I'm the Lumon Administrative Building,
branch 501.</i>

26:30.007 --> 26:32.800
<i>And you're sitting in me right now.</i>

26:32.801 --> 26:36.429
<i>The name's a mouthful,
or as I say, a "doorful."</i>

26:36.430 --> 26:38.891
<i>So you can just call me Lumon.</i>

26:40.309 --> 26:44.896
<i>I've gone through a lot of changes
since my siring here in 1870.</i>

26:44.897 --> 26:49.066
<i>But one thing I've always had
is a love for my workers,</i>

26:49.067 --> 26:52.486
<i>both unsevered and severed.</i>

26:52.487 --> 26:53.821
<i>Not to brag,</i>

26:53.822 --> 26:57.575
<i>but my basement floor is one
of the premier severed workspaces</i>

26:57.576 --> 27:01.746
<i>in the 206 countries
from which Lumon operates.</i>

27:01.747 --> 27:04.583
<i>Hey, no running in my halls!</i>

27:05.876 --> 27:07.419
<i>That tickles.</i>

27:11.256 --> 27:14.885
<i>But what makes a building truly happy?</i>

27:16.178 --> 27:19.514
<i>This question came to light
when four MDR workers,</i>

27:19.515 --> 27:21.557
<i>dissatisfied with their severed lives,</i>

27:21.558 --> 27:25.770
<i>conspired to mount
what Lumon historians will forever call</i>

27:25.771 --> 27:28.023
<i>the Macrodat Uprising.</i>

27:29.233 --> 27:35.030
<i>Under my literal nose unfolded
a human drama of danger and intrigue.</i>

27:36.406 --> 27:37.783
<i>Righteous anger.</i>

27:38.283 --> 27:40.702
<i>Let's burn this place to the ground.</i>

27:46.166 --> 27:48.001
<i>Inspiration.</i>

27:48.877 --> 27:53.090
<i>Why are we down here
still working in the dark?</i>

27:56.093 --> 27:57.636
<i>And love.</i>

28:01.390 --> 28:02.683
What the shit?

28:05.727 --> 28:09.815
<i>The Macrodat Uprising
yielded bounteous reforms.</i>

28:10.440 --> 28:15.611
<i>These include tasty new snacks,
like fruit leather, cut beans,</i>

28:15.612 --> 28:18.574
<i>Christmas mints, and salsa.</i>

28:23.412 --> 28:25.204
Wh--

28:25.205 --> 28:27.039
<i>Not sold yet?</i>

28:27.040 --> 28:29.792
<i>The incentives were also reformed</i>

28:29.793 --> 28:34.923
<i>and now range from hall passes
to pineapple bobbing...</i>

28:39.720 --> 28:43.557
<i>to our brand-new playful mirror room.</i>

28:46.894 --> 28:52.023
<i>You know, it's funny. I've sat by
this reflective pool my whole life,</i>

28:52.024 --> 28:58.864
<i>yet it took the quiet courage of four
MDR heroes to show me who I really am.</i>

28:59.740 --> 29:02.325
<i>They made quite a splash.</i>

29:02.326 --> 29:07.873
<i>They sure did, Water Tower.
And I thank Kier for them.</i>

29:09.041 --> 29:13.629
<i>I thank Kier for the Macrodat Uprising.</i>

29:31.438 --> 29:33.232
I know we have our differences...

29:35.567 --> 29:39.738
but I want you to know that
I truly respect each and every one of you.

29:42.282 --> 29:43.659
And I don't wanna be your jailer.

29:47.496 --> 29:51.165
By end of day, each of you will choose
whether you want to remain here.

29:51.166 --> 29:54.002
Not your outies, but you.

29:55.170 --> 29:58.005
If you start work on your file,
I'll assume you want to stay.

29:58.006 --> 30:01.718
If not, I'll send you to the surface.
No ill will.

30:03.804 --> 30:06.473
Maybe I'll even buy you
a drink at a bistro one day.

30:09.142 --> 30:10.977
Like the rest of the severed floor,

30:10.978 --> 30:14.648
the break room has no cameras
or microphones.

30:15.649 --> 30:19.068
Privacy shouldn't mean packing
into a supply closet

30:19.069 --> 30:20.696
like so many sardines.

30:24.950 --> 30:30.622
I truly hope you all will choose to stay
and enjoy what you've helped build.

30:32.124 --> 30:34.918
A new quarter. A fresh start.

30:36.670 --> 30:37.671
For all of us.

30:52.311 --> 30:53.311
What the hell was that?

30:53.312 --> 30:55.439
Massive-ass head game is what that was.

30:56.982 --> 30:59.443
So what the hell
did you guys see up there?

31:00.694 --> 31:01.777
Well...

31:01.778 --> 31:03.279
He said there were no microphones in here.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.740
Yeah, he says a lot of shit,
so just fucking whisper it.

31:05.741 --> 31:06.908
Okay.

31:06.909 --> 31:12.205
So, I was at a party
at my sister's house for Ricken Hale.

31:12.206 --> 31:13.290
Wait, what?

31:13.790 --> 31:15.124
You know Ricken Hale?

31:15.125 --> 31:17.210
He's my outie's brother-in-law.

31:17.211 --> 31:18.669
What?

31:18.670 --> 31:22.925
And for some reason, we both know Cobel.

31:23.842 --> 31:24.843
That's insane.

31:25.344 --> 31:27.721
Yeah. Well, there's something else.

31:29.014 --> 31:32.975
Just before I switched back,
I found a wedding photo.

31:32.976 --> 31:36.729
Now, I guess my outie's wife died
a few years ago.

31:36.730 --> 31:38.314
Oh, shit.

31:38.315 --> 31:41.025
Which, apparently, is part of
why I decided to get severed.

31:41.026 --> 31:42.110
Except...

31:46.198 --> 31:50.702
the woman in the photo was Ms. Casey.

31:55.082 --> 31:57.500
Ms. Casey is your wife?

31:57.501 --> 31:58.918
Is my outie's wife.

31:58.919 --> 32:00.503
But she's dead.

32:00.504 --> 32:02.965
No, I know, but it was her.

32:07.010 --> 32:08.720
Then she's down here.

32:09.888 --> 32:13.016
No. I went to Wellness. It's gone.

32:13.767 --> 32:14.976
What do you mean, gone?

32:14.977 --> 32:17.688
I mean, it's gone.

32:18.480 --> 32:22.150
Oh, my God. Mark, are you okay?

32:23.610 --> 32:25.946
Yeah. Well, I don't know.

32:27.322 --> 32:29.283
What about you? What did you see?

32:33.328 --> 32:37.123
I saw the inside

32:37.124 --> 32:40.836
of a really fucking boring apartment.

32:41.420 --> 32:43.463
So, you live by yourself?

32:44.548 --> 32:45.549
Yeah.

32:46.675 --> 32:51.513
I was watching some nature show on TV,
wearing sweatpants and a T-shirt.

32:52.306 --> 32:56.517
What kind of T-shirt?
Did it feature, like, a band or pocket?

32:56.518 --> 32:58.770
It was like a "save the gorillas" shirt.

32:59.771 --> 33:00.855
Cool.

33:00.856 --> 33:02.065
I guess.

33:04.193 --> 33:05.319
And then what?

33:06.695 --> 33:10.407
Then I went outside and found a guy.
He looked like a gardener.

33:11.491 --> 33:13.743
Told him everything. I think
he kind of thought it was bullshit.

33:13.744 --> 33:15.995
But he said that his brother was a cop

33:15.996 --> 33:18.373
and that he would tell him everything.

33:21.168 --> 33:25.339
I don't know. Sorry, guys. I really tried.

33:28.509 --> 33:30.135
A gardener?

33:32.262 --> 33:33.430
Yeah.

33:34.181 --> 33:35.599
A night gardener?

33:37.226 --> 33:40.312
I think so. I mean, maybe
he has a different job during the day.

33:43.023 --> 33:44.066
What about you, Irv?

33:49.821 --> 33:52.157
Do you suppose he's serious?

33:53.242 --> 33:55.953
About letting us leave?

34:02.793 --> 34:04.211
Irv, what did you see?

34:07.965 --> 34:09.716
It's not our world up there.

34:11.969 --> 34:13.262
That's what I saw.

34:15.597 --> 34:16.723
Come on, man.

34:18.433 --> 34:19.768
You can tell us.

34:23.188 --> 34:24.940
Yeah, it's okay.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.777
Even if it's bad.

35:03.854 --> 35:04.854
Irv.

35:04.855 --> 35:07.441
I just wanna walk for a bit.

35:09.568 --> 35:11.068
- I'll talk to him.
- No, no. We should all go.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.320
No. He's fine, okay?

35:12.321 --> 35:15.323
Let me talk him down. You go back to camp.
I'll get you if I need you.

35:15.324 --> 35:16.575
- Are you sure? You--
- But--

35:30.088 --> 35:32.007
Hey, Irv's gonna be okay, right?

35:33.050 --> 35:34.051
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:34.843 --> 35:35.928
Dylan's on it.

35:37.262 --> 35:39.972
And we have till the end of the day.

35:39.973 --> 35:41.058
Yeah.

35:48.774 --> 35:52.319
Did you guys look happy
in the wedding photo?

35:54.488 --> 35:55.489
Yeah, we did.

35:59.660 --> 36:04.665
You know, I never, like--
Ms. Casey and I never felt that way.

36:06.583 --> 36:07.584
Okay.

36:10.546 --> 36:11.713
So, what are you gonna do?

36:13.632 --> 36:14.466
Well...

36:18.720 --> 36:20.138
I gotta get her out of here.

36:21.932 --> 36:24.393
Right? I mean, if she's my wife...

36:25.227 --> 36:27.896
Right. Of course.
I mean, assuming she's still here.

36:31.567 --> 36:34.528
Though technically, strictly speaking,
she's not your wife.

36:35.654 --> 36:37.489
I'm pretty sure
your outie bought the ring.

36:38.615 --> 36:39.616
Sure.

36:40.576 --> 36:44.538
Except, you know,
we're the same-ish person.

36:46.665 --> 36:48.667
So, it's mushy.

36:49.668 --> 36:51.252
It's mushy?

36:51.253 --> 36:54.005
- Is that what it is? Mushy? Okay.
- It's-- Yeah. Listen, Helly--

36:54.006 --> 36:56.175
We're not the same, actually.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.221
Us and the outies, we're not.

37:02.639 --> 37:04.892
And speaking for myself,
I don't think we owe them shit.

37:08.478 --> 37:10.147
But Ms. Casey is--

37:11.773 --> 37:12.983
Well, she's one of us.

37:15.903 --> 37:19.489
So, if you wanna help your outie
and find out what happened to her...

37:21.950 --> 37:22.951
I'll help.

37:26.955 --> 37:28.123
So you're staying?

37:32.127 --> 37:33.128
I think I'm staying.

37:47.434 --> 37:49.727
- Irv. Hold up.
- Leave me alone, Dylan.

37:49.728 --> 37:54.525
Oka-- Dude. Is it--
You can't leave until the end of the day.

37:56.860 --> 37:58.069
Are you sure?

37:58.070 --> 37:59.154
Irv.

37:59.905 --> 38:01.698
I failed at the objective.

38:03.367 --> 38:04.368
What?

38:04.868 --> 38:06.828
I went to go find Burt.

38:08.413 --> 38:09.831
Okay. Did you see him?

38:11.792 --> 38:16.964
He's married,
or, at least, he's with someone.

38:18.173 --> 38:20.634
I saw them through the window.

38:21.218 --> 38:22.219
Shit.

38:23.971 --> 38:25.722
I should be happy he's happy.

38:26.265 --> 38:31.979
Yeah.
But seems like you're probably not, right?

38:33.230 --> 38:37.276
The last time I was happy
was when all I knew was MDR.

38:38.443 --> 38:39.820
When I was good at my job

38:41.446 --> 38:42.739
and not trying to be happy.

38:45.075 --> 38:46.158
I'm going to leave, Dylan.

38:46.159 --> 38:48.703
It is not leaving.
So stop fucking calling it that.

38:48.704 --> 38:50.706
- I know, you want-- I know--
- Just fucking try.

39:01.091 --> 39:02.509
You're a good friend, Dylan.

39:10.267 --> 39:13.811
Before I went to Burt's,
I woke up in my apartment.

39:13.812 --> 39:14.980
What?

39:16.815 --> 39:19.525
I was standing in front of
some kind of easel.

39:19.526 --> 39:21.444
Fuck. There's easels up there?

39:21.445 --> 39:26.824
Yeah. My outie was working on
a painting of a hallway. A black hallway.

39:26.825 --> 39:28.159
Like the break room one?

39:28.160 --> 39:30.037
No, it was different. Darker.

39:30.621 --> 39:34.166
There was an elevator at the end
with a downward arrow.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.334
He painted dozens of them.

39:36.335 --> 39:37.251
Fuck. Why?

39:37.252 --> 39:42.423
I don't know.
And I wanted you to know before I left.

39:42.424 --> 39:44.091
Okay. Well, you're not. You-- No.

39:44.092 --> 39:46.844
Stop it. Listen to me.

39:46.845 --> 39:51.015
Look, I'm sorry that outie Burt
has a hot husband or whatever.

39:51.016 --> 39:54.435
But he is not the point.
Innie Burt is the guy you fell for,

39:54.436 --> 39:56.730
and I know
because I encouraged the courtship.

39:58.065 --> 39:59.066
I--

40:01.360 --> 40:02.902
I want it to be over.

40:02.903 --> 40:06.822
Okay. So then after you find
the black hallway or--

40:06.823 --> 40:09.701
I want the pain to be over.

40:11.620 --> 40:14.413
If he's gone and I'm gone...

40:14.414 --> 40:15.540
Stop saying that.

40:15.541 --> 40:17.500
...then somehow, we'll be together.

40:17.501 --> 40:18.668
He wouldn't want that.

40:18.669 --> 40:19.753
How do you know?

40:22.589 --> 40:24.007
Because I don't want that.

40:27.135 --> 40:28.762
Because I would be sad,

40:30.097 --> 40:31.889
and I would be less productive,

40:31.890 --> 40:35.351
and I'm really good at what I do here,
whatever it is.

40:35.352 --> 40:39.106
And you're part of what makes me
good at it. So please, do not go.

40:44.820 --> 40:45.988
Dylan.

40:53.370 --> 40:55.122
I'm your favorite perk.

40:57.040 --> 40:58.625
Don't bring them into this.

40:59.668 --> 41:02.295
All I'm saying is, if Burt was still here,

41:02.296 --> 41:06.049
he would be telling you to stick around
and figure out what the fuck this is.

41:07.718 --> 41:08.719
Dylan G.

41:14.725 --> 41:16.685
Mr. Milchick would like to see you.

41:26.528 --> 41:27.529
Right.

41:54.097 --> 41:56.767
I know, but they said it would be
corrected by now.

41:57.893 --> 41:59.728
It should be Mr. Milchick.

42:01.021 --> 42:06.193
M-R-period-space-M-I-L-C-H-I-C-K.

42:08.487 --> 42:09.987
- Well, I sympathize...
- Mr. Milchick--

42:09.988 --> 42:14.409
...but could you please see
that it's taken care of? Yes. Thank you.

42:16.161 --> 42:17.578
If someone calls about my welcome screen,

42:17.579 --> 42:19.288
I need you to put
that call through immediately.

42:19.289 --> 42:20.374
Yes, sir.

42:22.292 --> 42:23.377
You wanted to see me?

42:25.295 --> 42:26.296
I did.

42:28.382 --> 42:30.092
Thank you, Miss Huang.

42:38.517 --> 42:40.143
You gonna apologize about the belt?

42:49.611 --> 42:51.488
Your wife's name is Gretchen.

42:55.617 --> 42:56.618
What?

42:57.828 --> 42:59.246
She wanted you to know.

43:00.831 --> 43:01.832
Come with me.

43:13.343 --> 43:17.014
And I do apologize, Dylan,
for not being a better listener.

43:18.473 --> 43:20.058
For not hearing your needs.

43:24.897 --> 43:26.148
Take a look.

43:30.736 --> 43:33.029
These are blueprints for a new renovation,

43:33.030 --> 43:35.616
of which I chose
not to inform your colleagues.

43:36.950 --> 43:39.870
It's called
the Outie Family Visitation Suite.

43:44.583 --> 43:46.668
Are you saying I could see my family here?

43:48.045 --> 43:53.091
If you take the name of the room
at face value, I'd say yes.

43:56.386 --> 43:57.387
Holy fuck.

43:58.305 --> 43:59.431
The holiest.

44:00.724 --> 44:03.477
Sadly, everyone else
in your department is single.

44:04.394 --> 44:07.355
As such, I'm asking that you
keep this between us...

44:07.356 --> 44:10.609
- Are you--
- ...only to avoid resentment.

44:11.527 --> 44:14.905
I'd hate for your friends to turn against
you after all you've done for them.

45:46.413 --> 45:47.414
You okay?

45:48.582 --> 45:49.749
I'm okay.

45:49.750 --> 45:50.834
Where's Irv?

45:54.755 --> 45:55.756
Right here.

46:04.598 --> 46:06.808
Irv. You okay?

46:08.519 --> 46:09.520
I'm okay.
