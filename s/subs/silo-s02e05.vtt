WEBVTT

00:08.090 --> 00:10.302
- They killed the judge!
- Come on!

00:11.303 --> 00:12.763
Don't let them get away!

00:37.079 --> 00:38.455
So what happened?

00:39.331 --> 00:42.334
I haven't exactly trained for this moment.
That's what happened.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.961
- I thought I'd be the first to go down.
- Yeah.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.212
Me too.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.006
- There's more people joining.
- We can't get past them.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.008
We have to. It's the only way home.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.261
Maybe not.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.097
The porters?

00:56.181 --> 00:57.891
You're still mixed up with them?

00:59.184 --> 01:01.770
We just gotta make it down
two more levels.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.564
Try to keep up.

01:06.692 --> 01:09.319
There's no way to argue it wasn't you.

01:13.282 --> 01:14.491
I don't see how.

01:15.409 --> 01:19.078
He doesn't know the name of my listeners
but he knows the hallmarks.

01:19.079 --> 01:22.249
He clearly traced the campaign
to impeach Meadows back to me.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.418
Mom.

01:25.002 --> 01:26.127
Mom.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.922
- Just a minute, honey.
- There's a man in the kitchen.

01:33.635 --> 01:34.844
Can I help you with that?

01:34.845 --> 01:38.014
Can't remember the last time
I made my own coffee.

01:38.015 --> 01:43.187
I don't speak about Mayor Jahns often,
but she always made her own coffee.

01:44.479 --> 01:49.025
She said doing the everyday tasks
of the ordinary people of the Silo

01:49.026 --> 01:54.198
helped her feel connected to them
when nothing else did.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.490
This job, you see,

01:56.491 --> 02:02.247
requires me to have
a different perspective than anybody.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.963
Here, let me.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.258
That machine's finicky.

02:13.717 --> 02:17.012
I'm supposed to be pretty good
with machines.

02:21.183 --> 02:24.852
You used to work with Rob, correct?

02:24.853 --> 02:28.689
I used to work for him,
as he likes to remind me.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.651
Does he discuss work with you?

02:33.862 --> 02:37.324
Robert finds I'm not much interested
in that work anymore.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.869
I have my job in IT and I have my son.

02:42.579 --> 02:47.458
The Pact says, "Mothers are a vessel
to deliver our children into the world,

02:47.459 --> 02:50.087
just as the Silo is a vessel
for the people."

02:51.547 --> 02:53.382
In our family, we take that to heart.

02:55.175 --> 03:00.347
Your family reads the Pact together,
I think you told me?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.598
Every night.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.435
Would you mind getting your copy
of the Pact for me?

03:07.938 --> 03:08.939
Sure.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.618
You betrayed my trust, Rob.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.621
You made me do something
I didn't want to do.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.958
You will no longer
be head of Judicial Security.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.170
You will not be my shadow.

03:31.795 --> 03:35.590
But you're too valuable to sideline.

03:35.591 --> 03:38.427
So you'll take Mary's job.
You'll be Judge.

03:40.596 --> 03:44.683
Place your hand on the Pact
and repeat after me.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.229
I, Robert Sims, do solemnly swear...

05:30.163 --> 05:31.373
I'm gonna go take a look.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.420
- Calvin here?
- Who's asking?

05:37.421 --> 05:41.048
Calvin. Haven't seen you for a while.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.843
I always stop seeing porters
after a certain age.

05:43.844 --> 05:44.927
Knees.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.555
You're gonna lead with an insult,
woman in your position?

05:47.556 --> 05:50.016
You'll be lucky if any part of you
makes it back down.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.518
That's why we're here.

05:52.811 --> 05:54.729
We need a place to rest up,

05:54.730 --> 05:59.025
and I need transport home
for me and my friends.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.359
It'll cost you.

06:00.360 --> 06:05.781
I may or may not
have a case of before times bourbon.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.868
It's gonna take more than old booze.

06:09.369 --> 06:12.247
Do you have anything that belonged
to Juliette Nichols?

06:26.845 --> 06:29.139
Hi. What you doing?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.974
Well, I didn't get a firefighter helmet,

06:31.975 --> 06:34.936
and I don't want to go back in the water.

06:34.937 --> 06:37.648
So I'm trying to see
if my old one could connect.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.360
Hey, I was gonna ask.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.987
Your generator is under
a hundred levels of water.

06:44.988 --> 06:48.033
So, how are the lights on?

06:49.284 --> 06:51.662
IT has its own power source.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.163
Comes from the outside.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.581
Where from the outside?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.543
Just up, like--

07:02.840 --> 07:05.050
Do you know why the generator failed?

07:06.593 --> 07:09.303
Yeah, some Judicial raiders
had the bright idea

07:09.304 --> 07:12.974
of blowing up the groundwater pump
on 144 to flood out Mechanical.

07:12.975 --> 07:16.602
But they couldn't get it fixed
before the water took out the generator.

07:16.603 --> 07:20.107
So, the water keeps--

07:20.983 --> 07:21.984
Right.

07:23.735 --> 07:25.236
Do you think--

07:25.237 --> 07:28.239
Do you think there's a way
to stop the water from rising?

07:28.240 --> 07:31.910
Your nearest groundwater pump is on 30.

07:32.411 --> 07:33.411
Underwater.

07:33.412 --> 07:36.330
But you could run power to it.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.082
Maybe you could stop it from rising.

07:38.083 --> 07:39.668
- Yeah.
- Wait, you--

07:40.836 --> 07:41.919
You could stop it.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.296
Me? No.

07:43.297 --> 07:46.215
- I don't have time. I have to do this.
- No, I don't have time.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.092
- I'm running out of time.
- You're not running out of time.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.219
- You have months. Years to figure out--
- Ten months. Ten.

07:50.220 --> 07:52.597
- I have ten months. Yeah.
- Ten months? I have days.

07:52.598 --> 07:54.391
Yeah, but you don't know that for sure.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.517
So why would I take that risk?

07:56.518 --> 07:59.979
In ten months, the water's coming into IT.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.024
- In 13, it'll be completely under water.
- No. No, stop!

08:03.025 --> 08:06.527
Look, this is what I need to do
and that is not working, okay?

08:06.528 --> 08:09.322
- I can't connect it.
- Where are you going?

08:09.323 --> 08:12.492
I need to go to the suit room and see
if I can find a helmet that works.

08:15.787 --> 08:16.872
Hey, wait!

08:17.414 --> 08:18.414
Where are they?

08:18.415 --> 08:20.583
They got off the stairs at 70.
Multiple cameras went down

08:20.584 --> 08:23.002
and we don't know where they are,
but I sent a team of raiders.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.545
They're disguised as citizens

08:24.546 --> 08:27.715
and they're stirring up mobs
from 60 down to 130.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.676
- You put a bounty on the two leaders?
- 1,000 credits each.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.638
Have Judicial erect a barricade at 130,
in case they elude the mobs.

08:33.639 --> 08:35.389
They won't get by my people.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.432
Humor me, Mr. Amundsen.

08:37.433 --> 08:39.560
I worry. That's my job.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.312
And in the interest of expediency,

08:41.313 --> 08:43.731
I will overlook the use of the phrase
"my people."

08:43.732 --> 08:45.484
Let me be very clear.

08:46.068 --> 08:50.404
There is no manner in which
the Judicial raiders are yours.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.450
Message just came in.
We have a location for them on 70.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.662
How do I know it's hers?

08:58.830 --> 08:59.873
You don't.

09:00.707 --> 09:01.749
But I do.

09:01.750 --> 09:04.794
'Cause I'm the one
who gave it to her 20 years ago.

09:04.795 --> 09:09.507
And I'm the one who fixed the hinge
when she used it to pry out frozen bolts,

09:09.508 --> 09:11.425
which I told her not to do.

09:11.426 --> 09:12.594
I'll take it.

09:13.720 --> 09:17.224
Plus the two dozen refrigeration coils
you promised for your little stay.

09:17.933 --> 09:20.561
Throw in the old booze
and we've got a deal.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.773
- So, what's your plan?
- Grain bins.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.609
Everyone knows the mill in 59
breaks down every other week.

09:28.610 --> 09:32.738
No one will blink an eye at grain
on its way down to the lower mills.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.991
- Fuck that.
- I didn't promise a comfortable ride.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.951
I'm not asking for comfort.

09:36.952 --> 09:41.080
It's just that we have a fourth.
Rather large. No way he'll fit.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.249
All I got.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.710
What about the descender rig?

09:45.335 --> 09:46.919
- Not sure what you mean.
- Sure you do.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.213
I don't.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.716
- It's a powered winch and cable system.
- It's against the Pact.

09:51.717 --> 09:54.385
And you acquired it in some kind
of Pact-approved manner?

09:54.386 --> 09:56.138
We took it out of circulation is all.

09:56.638 --> 09:59.098
Porters have the exclusive right
to move all Silo goods.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.474
People see something like that,

10:00.475 --> 10:02.310
they start getting other ideas.

10:02.311 --> 10:03.394
We gotta go!

10:03.395 --> 10:05.521
Raiders are coming. Let's go!

10:05.522 --> 10:08.357
- You sent a message to Judicial.
- I was gonna help you, I promise.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.775
But there's a price on their heads.

10:09.776 --> 10:12.445
One that's too high to pass up,
even for old friends.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.531
- McLain!
- Son of a bitch!

10:16.450 --> 10:19.786
Doc Phelan says Kennedy
hasn't been to see him.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.623
Maybe Kennedy knows his reputation.

10:23.624 --> 10:27.418
Now the best get assigned to up top
and we end up with what's left.

10:27.419 --> 10:29.213
Apart from me, that is.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.344
What is it?

10:37.721 --> 10:41.016
I got a message
from the new head of Judicial Security.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.519
Rick Amundsen.

10:44.228 --> 10:45.604
What happened to Sims?

10:47.731 --> 10:49.149
He's been sworn in as Judge.

10:52.402 --> 10:53.653
Where's Meadows?

10:53.654 --> 10:54.863
Dead.

10:56.949 --> 10:58.116
Murdered.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.743
What?

11:00.285 --> 11:02.788
By the head of Mechanical
and his colleague.

11:06.708 --> 11:07.960
Knox and Shirley?

11:10.712 --> 11:12.755
That didn't look
like Jules's multi-tool to me.

11:12.756 --> 11:15.801
Hell no, it was mine.
I have no idea where hers is.

11:17.094 --> 11:19.220
Careful. Okay, I got you.

11:19.221 --> 11:20.972
- Okay.
- Are you okay?

11:20.973 --> 11:22.598
Listen, we better split up

11:22.599 --> 11:25.268
because we can't keep holding you back,
slowing you down.

11:25.269 --> 11:26.686
The bounty's on Shirley and me.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.855
It's even odds who's gonna get who killed.

11:28.856 --> 11:32.943
Let's not get maudlin about it.
Get out of here. Go.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.494
- You're not staying.
- What?

11:43.495 --> 11:46.664
You may not have anticipated
this exact scenario

11:46.665 --> 11:49.417
when you locked yourself
in that workshop 25 years ago.

11:49.418 --> 11:53.754
But now, nobody above 125
knows who the heck you are.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.798
That's gonna work to your advantage.

11:55.799 --> 11:58.885
I, however, am the head of Supply.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.387
- Carla, I am not going--
- Martha.

12:01.180 --> 12:03.222
They are gonna need you down there.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.267
Probably now more than ever.

12:08.687 --> 12:09.688
Go.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.358
Go.

12:35.339 --> 12:36.881
It's just an ordinary scrape.

12:36.882 --> 12:38.967
You clean it with soap
and it'll heal just fine.

12:40.594 --> 12:41.637
Let me see.

12:42.179 --> 12:44.680
Okay. It's not too bad.
Just keep the pressure on.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.140
I'll be right back.

12:46.141 --> 12:50.436
Clove oil will help with the pain
and the aromatic should help you sleep.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.439
Thanks. Smells real nice.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.400
But I heard my shoulder pop.
Better go see the doc about that.

12:56.401 --> 12:58.278
That's a good idea. He's right over there.

12:59.071 --> 13:00.363
That hurt.

13:00.364 --> 13:02.156
Move it around.

13:02.157 --> 13:03.407
Yeah.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.451
Don't forget to take the clove oil.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.287
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.249
It's an impressive technique
for someone wearing a baby.

13:11.250 --> 13:13.000
Thank you. My mother was an herbalist.

13:13.001 --> 13:15.420
And my father was a drunk,
who lost a lot of fights.

13:16.213 --> 13:17.548
Dr. Pete Nichols.

13:19.216 --> 13:20.716
Nice to meet you.

13:20.717 --> 13:21.843
Kathleen Billings.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.679
As in Sheriff Billings?

13:24.763 --> 13:26.764
Now I know why you're out here
tending the wounded.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.058
It's a good distraction.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.853
I can't sit at home. I get too anxious.

13:35.232 --> 13:36.482
Paul was sent to Mechanical.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.526
There was some kind
of incident down there.

13:38.527 --> 13:41.112
- Yeah, I heard. Some kind of fire or--
- Dr. Nichols.

13:41.113 --> 13:42.321
Uh-huh?

13:42.322 --> 13:43.407
Please come with us.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.159
Now.

13:53.750 --> 13:55.085
What's his plan?

13:57.838 --> 13:59.965
Have the Silo take down the killers.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.759
If he succeeds,
it'll be like a reset for him.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.971
Like Juliette Nichols never happened.

14:07.181 --> 14:09.308
You've run missions like that.

14:09.933 --> 14:11.684
Raiders in plainclothes.

14:11.685 --> 14:13.227
Big bounty on the fugitives.

14:13.228 --> 14:14.562
Mobs chase them down.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.522
Maybe take the law into their own hands.

14:16.523 --> 14:19.610
A sensitive operation like that
takes experience, Rob.

14:20.235 --> 14:21.611
Amundsen's good.

14:21.612 --> 14:24.823
He was trained by the best,
but he isn't the best.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.451
What if he's not up to it?

14:36.710 --> 14:38.670
Make the most of the job, Robert.

14:53.602 --> 14:54.603
Yeah.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.401
Dr. Nichols.

15:01.902 --> 15:03.153
Thank you for coming.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.574
If you think I know something about
those Mechanical folks, you're mistaken.

15:08.575 --> 15:11.202
No.

15:11.203 --> 15:13.830
No, it has nothing to do with that.

15:14.790 --> 15:20.045
I just thought that you might
like some of your daughter's things.

15:21.046 --> 15:25.258
Under normal circumstances, these items
would be put back into circulation,

15:25.259 --> 15:28.428
but these circumstances
are far from normal.

15:29.096 --> 15:35.309
If these items were to be put back,
I'm afraid they would be venerated,

15:35.310 --> 15:39.565
coveted, cause envy
and dissension and ultimately violence.

15:40.065 --> 15:42.984
It wouldn't be the only way
that your daughter's memory

15:42.985 --> 15:45.904
has been distorted
to fit the agendas of others.

15:46.905 --> 15:50.700
I heard that you were tending
to people wounded in the riot

15:50.701 --> 15:52.743
after Judge Meadows's murder.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.413
That spirit of service gives me hope

15:55.414 --> 15:58.876
that you might be a bigger part
of this moment.

15:59.918 --> 16:04.464
This movement to restore order to the Silo

16:05.340 --> 16:06.675
and faith in the Pact.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.136
What if I say no?

16:10.345 --> 16:11.679
Why would you say no?

16:11.680 --> 16:13.348
I just want to be clear.

16:14.433 --> 16:17.102
If I don't help you, what happens?

16:17.811 --> 16:20.272
There is nothing left for me to lose,
is there?

16:20.981 --> 16:25.986
The Silo has taken my son,
my wife and now my daughter.

16:29.865 --> 16:33.534
I wasn't tending to the wounded
out of a sense of duty to the Silo,

16:33.535 --> 16:38.456
I was trying to reclaim some sense
of professional integrity.

16:38.457 --> 16:41.585
I was trying to practice medicine
without lies, without harm.

16:42.169 --> 16:45.589
All those birth control removals
marked Code Orange.

16:46.215 --> 16:47.965
I see those young couples.

16:47.966 --> 16:50.135
Their faces alight with hope.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.222
Hope that I know is unfounded.

16:55.349 --> 16:57.142
My profession is a sham.

17:01.188 --> 17:03.065
The Silo took that from me too.

17:09.070 --> 17:11.781
For whatever reason, my daughter is dead.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.537
You can't control what she means
to people.

17:19.164 --> 17:21.290
You can't control what she means to me.

17:34.179 --> 17:35.263
So, Solo...

17:35.264 --> 17:37.765
- Yeah.
- ...that's not your real name, is it?

17:37.766 --> 17:40.935
- No. Cole Myers is my name.
- Cole.

17:40.936 --> 17:45.273
I went to an event and they asked me,
"Who are you with?"

17:45.274 --> 17:47.525
And I said, "I'm solo,"

17:47.526 --> 17:50.236
and Russell's kid was there
and he overheard me say that

17:50.237 --> 17:53.364
and he thought that was my name,
so the name stuck.

17:53.365 --> 17:57.494
But hey, what's in a name?

17:58.287 --> 17:59.288
Right.

18:00.080 --> 18:00.913
Right.

18:00.914 --> 18:04.084
That's from your play.
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> before they die.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.043
Before who dies?

18:06.044 --> 18:07.713
Romeo and Juliet.

18:08.213 --> 18:10.465
- They don't die. No.
- Yeah, they do.

18:11.592 --> 18:13.177
In ours, they do.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.929
- Fuck.
- Are you okay?

18:16.680 --> 18:17.889
- Yeah.
- Hey, are you hungr--

18:17.890 --> 18:20.224
I don't know, I just feel-- I'm tired.
Just-- I'm good.

18:20.225 --> 18:22.018
Are you hungry?

18:22.019 --> 18:23.936
- I don't know. Yeah, maybe.
- Yeah!

18:23.937 --> 18:26.648
- Okay, but stay--
- I'ma-- Yeah, I'm gonna go get some food.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.198
Shit.

18:41.914 --> 18:43.956
These are the reports
and briefings you're copied on.

18:43.957 --> 18:45.166
If they have little flags,

18:45.167 --> 18:47.668
they come with recommendations
from the mayor's office.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.128
When you've reached your decision,

18:49.129 --> 18:50.671
- you enter--
- Sharon, I've been in Judicial

18:50.672 --> 18:52.340
for some years now.

18:52.341 --> 18:54.091
Of course, Your Honor.

18:54.092 --> 18:57.053
We haven't been able to fabricate
your signature stamp yet.

18:57.054 --> 19:00.140
So, if you don't mind signing
for the time being until the stamps...

19:03.560 --> 19:04.561
Judge Sims?

19:54.695 --> 19:55.987
Good work.

19:55.988 --> 19:57.572
The others?

19:57.573 --> 19:59.867
The two we put the bounty on
are on the stairs.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.869
I've got raiders out of uniform
just a couple levels below.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.453
And we're whipping up the crowd.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.289
Let me know when you have them.

20:06.290 --> 20:07.416
Yes, sir.

20:14.256 --> 20:15.924
Thank you, you can go.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.052
Mr. Kyle.

20:19.595 --> 20:21.597
How's your time in the mines going?

20:23.182 --> 20:24.349
It's only been a day.

20:25.726 --> 20:27.393
Well, you're still alive.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.478
That's good.

20:29.855 --> 20:31.981
Do you know what the life expectancy is

20:31.982 --> 20:33.483
of someone sent to the mines?

20:33.984 --> 20:35.027
No, sir.

20:35.569 --> 20:36.903
Five years.

20:36.904 --> 20:39.530
So when Judge Meadows
cut your sentence in half,

20:39.531 --> 20:41.783
it was a symbolic gesture at best.

20:42.326 --> 20:44.994
It's unlikely you'd survive
your time there.

20:44.995 --> 20:46.621
Do you know why?

20:46.622 --> 20:47.914
Because it's dangerous? I--

20:47.915 --> 20:51.083
Rockfalls, suffocation, crushing injuries,

20:51.084 --> 20:53.837
lost limbs, explosions gone awry.

20:54.463 --> 20:56.548
It's hard duty.

20:57.591 --> 21:01.720
I'm going to offer you
some soft duty, Lukas.

21:02.221 --> 21:04.764
I have a project that requires your mind.

21:04.765 --> 21:06.641
On the day of Judge Meadows's murder,

21:06.642 --> 21:11.437
she relayed to me how you were able to
take small disparate bits of information

21:11.438 --> 21:15.192
about the lights in the night sky
and create a model that,

21:16.109 --> 21:18.904
between you and me, was not far off.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.406
Is that accurate?

21:24.826 --> 21:28.747
Well, I have something
that is also fragmented

21:29.331 --> 21:31.416
and I need you to reconstruct it.

21:33.210 --> 21:34.669
You recognize it?

21:34.670 --> 21:37.130
This is the hard drive
that Juliette Nichols showed you.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.716
You can tell me the truth.

21:40.425 --> 21:43.762
It won't put you
in any additional legal jeopardy.

21:47.266 --> 21:48.891
Yes, I recognize it.

21:48.892 --> 21:51.769
I smashed it
because it's a red-level relic

21:51.770 --> 21:54.106
and it likely contains
dangerous information.

21:54.815 --> 21:58.068
But now I no longer
have the luxury of ignorance.

21:59.236 --> 22:02.614
I need you to find out what is on it.

22:05.993 --> 22:07.786
You can work from this office.

22:11.915 --> 22:13.083
Do you have any questions?

22:14.543 --> 22:15.586
Come on.

22:18.213 --> 22:21.674
You must know that there are
at least three people out there

22:21.675 --> 22:25.053
in the IT bullpen
that can do this better than you.

22:27.806 --> 22:31.684
Well, Lukas, I know
that you will work harder

22:31.685 --> 22:33.770
than anyone I can find out there...

22:35.147 --> 22:38.192
because, well...

22:39.610 --> 22:41.862
you want to live more than five years.

23:09.890 --> 23:12.016
Judge, is everything okay?

23:12.017 --> 23:13.310
You tell me.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.103
The button isn't working.

23:16.230 --> 23:19.357
We have everything
handled here, Your Honor.

23:19.358 --> 23:20.691
Your Honor?

23:20.692 --> 23:21.777
Judge?

23:22.986 --> 23:26.114
Call me Rob
like you have the last ten years.

23:28.367 --> 23:30.743
I'm trying to figure this out,
just like you.

23:30.744 --> 23:32.662
I was just in my office.

23:32.663 --> 23:33.914
My new office.

23:35.165 --> 23:40.295
Sitting behind the desk of a woman
I worked for for the last 15 years.

23:41.713 --> 23:44.549
Thought it might be a good idea
to see how the search for the people

23:44.550 --> 23:45.843
who murdered her is going.

23:47.261 --> 23:49.428
I'll make sure you get
all the relevant details on your desk

23:49.429 --> 23:50.639
in the morning.

23:54.351 --> 23:55.894
The suspects are still on the stairs.

23:56.812 --> 23:58.647
We're using the plan you put in place.

24:03.485 --> 24:04.570
Move.

24:07.906 --> 24:09.365
You're in an awful hurry.

24:09.366 --> 24:13.202
Hey, my husband and I were just
headed down to see some friends.

24:13.203 --> 24:14.662
Well, that seems unwise.

24:14.663 --> 24:16.163
Dangerous killers on the loose.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.790
What are you all doing out?

24:17.791 --> 24:20.376
- We're concerned citizens.
- And who are you?

24:20.377 --> 24:21.627
Let's see some identification.

24:21.628 --> 24:25.882
Does the Pact require citizens
to show identification to other citizens

24:25.883 --> 24:27.758
who are concerned, or--

24:27.759 --> 24:28.968
- It does not.
- It doesn't--

24:28.969 --> 24:30.179
That one's armed!

24:40.397 --> 24:41.565
Stop!

24:42.107 --> 24:43.817
I said stop!

24:45.027 --> 24:46.361
I see some of you know me.

24:47.196 --> 24:48.946
And I know some of you too.

24:48.947 --> 24:51.115
You know who my husband is.

24:51.116 --> 24:53.785
What you might not know
is his new position.

24:55.162 --> 24:58.081
Judge Sims wants these fugitives
taken into custody.

25:00.584 --> 25:02.961
You want to kill them where they stand?
Well, I do too.

25:03.670 --> 25:07.089
But justice for Judge Meadows
doesn't only belong to us.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.592
It belongs to the Silo.

25:10.302 --> 25:13.180
And everyone will watch
when these two go out to clean.

25:20.896 --> 25:24.525
Come with me, or your greasy asses
are getting strung up right here.

25:33.492 --> 25:34.451
Okay.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.643
Shit.

26:37.222 --> 26:38.723
You'll be safe here for a while.

26:38.724 --> 26:40.726
You're not taking us to Judicial?

26:41.894 --> 26:44.562
Cameras still work on the stairs,
but they're out in this alleyway.

26:44.563 --> 26:47.273
When they see me headed back up alone,
they'll send more raiders after you.

26:47.274 --> 26:50.319
Maybe a lot of them.
So wait till it settles down to leave.

26:50.944 --> 26:52.486
There's a barricade on 130.

26:52.487 --> 26:56.490
No idea how you'll get through,
but that's not my problem.

26:56.491 --> 26:58.076
Why are you helping us?

27:03.165 --> 27:03.999
Camille.

27:05.292 --> 27:06.502
Morning, Asa.

27:07.503 --> 27:09.337
You're going to work early today.

27:09.338 --> 27:12.632
And you're staying back
at your ex-wife's tonight, on 83.

27:12.633 --> 27:16.344
- I just finished the night shift.
- Then your boss will just think

27:16.345 --> 27:18.388
you're the hardest working plumber
in the Silo.

27:19.515 --> 27:20.516
Give me your keys.

27:21.183 --> 27:22.684
What the fuck, Camille?

27:23.810 --> 27:27.021
When you hear about a bounty
for the people who murdered Meadows,

27:27.022 --> 27:29.942
you'll ignore it
so that I keep ignoring you.

27:31.151 --> 27:32.277
You understand?

27:35.072 --> 27:36.949
Well, can I put some pants on at least?

27:39.326 --> 27:41.161
Don't know why you didn't reach
for those first.

27:49.795 --> 27:51.255
They been caught?

27:55.092 --> 27:56.093
No.

27:57.427 --> 27:59.388
It's a pretty big conflict, huh?

28:01.265 --> 28:02.306
What?

28:02.307 --> 28:05.685
Well, being a sheriff's deputy
while my friends are being hunted

28:05.686 --> 28:08.063
as killers by half the Silo.

28:11.775 --> 28:14.110
About as big as swearing
to enforce the Pact

28:14.111 --> 28:17.406
while having a condition
expressly condemned by the Pact.

28:20.701 --> 28:21.702
Yeah.

28:23.412 --> 28:24.454
Do they know?

28:26.039 --> 28:27.291
Sims knows.

28:28.458 --> 28:31.253
As head of Judicial Security,
he made an allowance.

28:32.838 --> 28:34.214
As judge, I--

28:39.845 --> 28:41.763
I may have a line on Patrick Kennedy.

28:43.223 --> 28:45.474
Try not to eat everything in the fridge.

28:45.475 --> 28:47.393
I'm just a hardworking guy

28:47.394 --> 28:49.812
whose main job
is to keep the Silo running.

28:49.813 --> 28:51.857
- It depends what you got in there.
- Shirl.

28:52.357 --> 28:53.692
Kidding.

28:54.318 --> 28:56.361
How's she expect you
to get back in without a key?

28:57.863 --> 28:59.031
She doesn't.

28:59.865 --> 29:02.868
If she wants me to have it,
she'll find a way to get it to me.

29:03.827 --> 29:06.245
Word of advice, stay as long as you need.

29:06.246 --> 29:08.998
But if I were you,
I'd be gone before she gets back.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.375
I'm not helping her out of courtesy.

29:11.376 --> 29:14.379
Took you assholes in
'cause I'm afraid of her.

29:16.632 --> 29:17.633
You should be too.

29:30.020 --> 29:32.481
This guy lives in a fucking closet.

29:36.109 --> 29:38.236
Do you think every department
thinks they're the ones

29:38.237 --> 29:39.821
that keeps the Silo running?

29:40.781 --> 29:41.823
Probably.

29:42.324 --> 29:46.536
I have said those same words
as a way to rally everybody in Mechanical.

29:46.537 --> 29:48.871
And it worked because it's true.

29:48.872 --> 29:51.542
Even if the rest of the Silo
believes otherwise.

29:59.591 --> 30:01.467
You're a good leader, Knox.

30:01.468 --> 30:04.847
Mechanical would have gone to shit
years ago if it wasn't for you.

30:06.807 --> 30:10.811
I was wrong about what to do.

30:11.603 --> 30:13.730
I wanted to ask nicely and...

30:16.567 --> 30:17.734
Now we're gonna die for it.

30:20.237 --> 30:22.447
We were damned
from the beginning either way.

30:23.448 --> 30:27.286
But if we did it my way,
we'd already be dead.

30:32.374 --> 30:35.835
Do you think Knox and Shirley
killed Judge Meadows?

30:35.836 --> 30:39.047
Honestly? Since Jules walked,
things have gotten out of hand.

30:40.174 --> 30:42.301
Shirley and a mob attacking my station.

30:42.926 --> 30:47.681
Now Knox has teamed up with her.
They have no respect for Silo order.

30:48.640 --> 30:49.933
Do I think they killed Meadows?

30:50.893 --> 30:52.394
Not a fucking chance.

30:53.770 --> 30:54.855
Hold on.

30:58.025 --> 31:00.234
Hey, Frances. Hold up a sec.

31:00.235 --> 31:02.196
You mind telling us
where you're going with that meal?

31:03.947 --> 31:04.780
Home?

31:04.781 --> 31:06.365
But it's after midnight.

31:06.366 --> 31:07.909
Your shift started at 6:00 a.m.

31:07.910 --> 31:09.952
You telling me instead of sleeping,
you're gonna stay up

31:09.953 --> 31:12.538
and eat the same food you've been
slinging for the last 18 hours?

31:12.539 --> 31:15.917
Unless they passed a law against
that, Hank, yeah, that's what I'm doing.

31:15.918 --> 31:17.878
We know your history, Frances.

31:18.670 --> 31:22.548
Doris Kennedy was your aunt
and you sold some of the pills she stole.

31:22.549 --> 31:25.384
You got some proof about that? 'Cause
you sure as fuck didn't five years ago.

31:25.385 --> 31:27.011
Franny. We ain't here about that.

31:27.012 --> 31:29.138
We're here because we figure
your Uncle Patrick

31:29.139 --> 31:31.307
isn't gonna live much longer
on hot meals alone.

31:31.308 --> 31:34.269
So why don't you let us deliver that?

32:00.337 --> 32:02.839
How was your first day, Judge Sims?

32:02.840 --> 32:04.925
I signed where directed.

32:06.844 --> 32:08.261
I went to the Watcher's room.

32:08.262 --> 32:10.638
Tried to get some intel on the search.

32:10.639 --> 32:13.058
Amundsen wouldn't let me in.

32:14.476 --> 32:18.104
He did tell me three of the suspects
were still at large.

32:18.105 --> 32:20.481
Well, if you were in charge,

32:20.482 --> 32:22.985
they'd have been in custody hours ago.

32:33.996 --> 32:35.622
Excuse me, please.

32:37.708 --> 32:39.375
I live in 132.

32:39.376 --> 32:40.751
Not tonight you don't.

32:40.752 --> 32:44.881
I work for the sheriff's department.
Whatever this is, we weren't informed.

32:44.882 --> 32:47.550
This doesn't concern
the sheriff's department.

32:47.551 --> 32:50.678
Look, if Judicial thinks
they can keep citizens from their homes--

32:50.679 --> 32:53.473
Turn around and go back the way you came.

32:54.516 --> 32:55.975
Are you serious?

32:55.976 --> 32:57.810
You have no right to interfere

32:57.811 --> 33:00.563
with someone who is
a member of the sheriff's department.

33:00.564 --> 33:01.857
I need to get...

33:10.574 --> 33:12.700
The second we hit the stairs,
they'll see us.

33:12.701 --> 33:15.204
And as soon as we close this door,
we're locked out.

33:15.704 --> 33:16.913
We got to go home sometime.

33:16.914 --> 33:18.956
I say we hit the stairs and run like hell.

33:18.957 --> 33:20.875
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

33:20.876 --> 33:22.002
Okay.

33:22.878 --> 33:23.879
But not down.

33:24.713 --> 33:26.173
- Up.
- What?

33:26.673 --> 33:27.841
Trust me.

34:13.719 --> 34:16.805
They were caught in a mob.
A former raider stashed them on 73.

34:16.806 --> 34:18.140
So we checked every residence.

34:18.141 --> 34:19.058
Got nothing so far,

34:19.059 --> 34:21.185
- but I've locked down the trash chute.
- Hold on.

34:21.186 --> 34:24.105
Why did an ex-raider stash them on 73?

34:24.106 --> 34:26.148
She was concerned they might be strung up.

34:26.149 --> 34:27.400
Who was she?

34:29.027 --> 34:30.320
Camille Sims.

34:35.492 --> 34:37.619
Find those fucking Mechanicals.

34:41.373 --> 34:44.001
- How far are we going up?
- Just keep up.

35:37.471 --> 35:39.639
I was able to salvage very little.

35:39.640 --> 35:43.894
I found some fragments
that overlap with files in our database.

35:44.603 --> 35:45.937
This is our Silo map,

35:45.938 --> 35:49.857
and I've been using this file
to fill in some of the missing data

35:49.858 --> 35:53.362
from one of the fragments,
which is also a map.

35:53.862 --> 35:58.407
And now it differs from our Silo map
in a few places.

35:58.408 --> 36:02.995
There are lines that are coming
from outside the Silo walls.

36:02.996 --> 36:07.416
There's something on the IT level
and something on Judicial.

36:07.417 --> 36:09.210
Any idea what they are?

36:09.211 --> 36:10.337
No.

36:11.713 --> 36:12.755
There's something else.

36:12.756 --> 36:15.508
- There, at the very bottom of the Silo--
- What is it?

36:15.509 --> 36:17.552
- A tunnel.
- Where does it go?

36:17.553 --> 36:18.719
I have no idea.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.472
Well, keep working.

36:21.890 --> 36:25.102
You've earned another 24 hours
outside of the mine, Mr. Kyle.

36:26.353 --> 36:29.481
Sir, there was a folder also that I found.

36:30.691 --> 36:33.026
I was able to retrieve it
uncorrupted, and...

36:33.819 --> 36:36.195
and look, most of the files in it
were just these department memos,

36:36.196 --> 36:38.991
but one of them was different.

36:40.075 --> 36:45.496
It was a scan of a handwritten letter
someone wrote his wife.

36:45.497 --> 36:46.582
Who?

36:48.876 --> 36:50.544
Salvador Quinn.

36:52.504 --> 36:53.755
What did it say?

36:55.007 --> 36:58.510
Well, it's a love letter,
but then it gets kind of weird.

36:59.219 --> 37:01.930
- It sort of... It goes into this--
- It goes into code.

37:04.308 --> 37:05.726
Yeah, that's exactly right.

37:14.776 --> 37:16.069
Watch where you step.

37:29.833 --> 37:30.834
Hey.

37:40.928 --> 37:42.179
Patrick Kennedy.

37:42.888 --> 37:44.055
Don't move.

37:44.056 --> 37:45.182
That's good advice.

37:46.099 --> 37:47.892
It really doesn't feel great when I do.

37:47.893 --> 37:50.811
If you come any closer,
I'm gonna throw myself in this hole.

37:50.812 --> 37:54.065
We're staying put,
but your wounds need treatment.

37:54.066 --> 37:55.441
Yeah, it's funny, you know,

37:55.442 --> 37:58.319
with the guns, it looks like
you're gonna give me some fresh ones.

37:58.320 --> 38:01.532
You're a fugitive,
seen fire-bombing my deputy station.

38:02.241 --> 38:04.450
You understand
why we might be a little cautious.

38:04.451 --> 38:05.702
We can help you.

38:06.912 --> 38:08.664
I don't trust you.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.793
That's why I'm down here in the dark,

38:13.293 --> 38:15.378
bleeding in a fucking hole!

38:15.379 --> 38:16.587
There's a full med kit

38:16.588 --> 38:17.923
- in the generator control room.
- Go.

38:24.263 --> 38:25.889
That what you're waiting for?

38:26.807 --> 38:29.058
Now that we're all alone, you shoot me

38:29.059 --> 38:31.769
and hope that Deputy Longhair didn't count
the holes in me before he left?

38:31.770 --> 38:34.146
We don't shoot people
who don't pose an immediate threat.

38:34.147 --> 38:36.108
I pose an immediate threat.

38:36.900 --> 38:41.195
The things I know,
you'd be better to leave.

38:41.196 --> 38:42.447
I can't do that.

38:43.031 --> 38:46.242
I took an oath.
Part of that is rendering available aid.

38:46.243 --> 38:47.911
Rendering available aid?

38:48.954 --> 38:52.624
Don't you see that it's all a lie?

38:54.126 --> 38:55.711
Everything they told us.

38:56.211 --> 38:57.254
The Pact.

38:58.672 --> 39:00.381
It's just to keep us in line.

39:00.382 --> 39:03.968
And we will never ever find out the truth.

39:03.969 --> 39:07.680
Sims would shoot each one of us
before he'd let that shit happen.

39:07.681 --> 39:09.056
You know Mr. Sims?

39:09.057 --> 39:11.310
Yeah, I know him.

39:12.060 --> 39:13.729
I helped Nichols out.

39:14.855 --> 39:16.731
I was gagged and bagged.

39:16.732 --> 39:18.399
Why do you think I'm down here?

39:18.400 --> 39:19.568
Tell me.

39:20.903 --> 39:22.029
Okay.

39:22.654 --> 39:26.158
Okay. Sure, I'll tell you.

39:26.825 --> 39:28.035
Just give me your gun.

39:30.037 --> 39:35.042
That's right.
You can't 'cause you don't trust me.

39:36.335 --> 39:40.923
Look, if you're gonna shoot me, all I ask,
just put it right here, all right?

39:41.632 --> 39:42.674
Please.

39:51.517 --> 39:52.893
I found this

39:53.936 --> 39:56.855
in Juliette Nichols's apartment.

39:57.481 --> 39:58.565
In a book.

40:02.528 --> 40:04.071
I destroyed the rest.

40:05.405 --> 40:07.282
I couldn't tell you why I saved that.

40:10.077 --> 40:13.664
You tell anyone I have that, I'm finished.

40:16.708 --> 40:20.127
Get me a doctor.
Not a deputy with a Band-Aid.

40:20.128 --> 40:22.047
And I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

40:22.840 --> 40:26.260
No, I'll tell you everything
you sure as fuck don't want to know.

40:45.070 --> 40:46.238
New deal.

40:47.072 --> 40:48.323
How long is the cable?

40:49.616 --> 40:50.701
Guess you'll find out.

40:56.832 --> 40:59.375
This? It's not Juliette's.

40:59.376 --> 41:01.879
But fuck you
if I'm gonna let you sell it as hers.

41:20.230 --> 41:21.565
Barnes, pick it up.

41:23.192 --> 41:24.193
Come on.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.861
- <i>You have an update?</i>
- Not yet.

41:26.862 --> 41:29.072
<i>Look for any groups of two
moving down the stairs.</i>

41:29.907 --> 41:30.824
Copy.

41:33.285 --> 41:35.662
Level 92. Two porters headed down.

41:37.998 --> 41:40.708
<i>I'm not far behind.
Get a message to the mayor.</i>

41:40.709 --> 41:41.793
Copy.

41:46.840 --> 41:48.050
I've got dinner.

41:49.885 --> 41:50.886
What ya doing?

41:51.720 --> 41:55.264
I was trying to track down a helmet
that was stolen from the suit room.

41:55.265 --> 41:59.102
So I went to an employee's apartment,
trying to find it.

41:59.645 --> 42:01.230
Trina Samuel's.

42:03.106 --> 42:04.690
Trina Samuel's.

42:04.691 --> 42:08.195
Yeah. She was Solo's girlfriend.

42:09.154 --> 42:13.242
Yeah. I haven't thought about her
in a long time.

42:13.825 --> 42:16.494
Actually, I don't like thinking about her.

42:16.495 --> 42:18.287
Do you want chicken or beef?

42:18.288 --> 42:19.748
Why are you lying to me?

42:22.543 --> 42:24.419
I don't know what you're saying.

42:27.756 --> 42:30.551
Solo, Trina. That's her.

42:31.051 --> 42:33.720
That's not you, is it?

42:35.222 --> 42:37.557
No. 'Cause this... Look at this.
I found this.

42:37.558 --> 42:39.976
Cole Myers, the IT shadow.

42:39.977 --> 42:43.437
- That's the actual...
- I am the IT shadow!

42:43.438 --> 42:45.356
You don't know what you're talking about!

42:45.357 --> 42:49.360
Don't say those words to me!
Don't you ever!

42:49.361 --> 42:51.112
I am Solo!

42:51.113 --> 42:54.949
I am the IT shadow, do you hear me?

42:54.950 --> 42:58.494
- Okay.
- I am Solo! I am the IT shadow!

42:58.495 --> 42:59.746
You're Solo.

43:01.832 --> 43:03.000
You're Solo.

43:04.501 --> 43:05.502
I'm sorry.

43:06.879 --> 43:08.005
I'm sorry.

43:10.174 --> 43:11.300
I'm sorry.

43:20.225 --> 43:22.769
You look terrible.
You should really have something to eat.

43:26.523 --> 43:27.816
I'm not hungry.

43:30.360 --> 43:34.281
I don't feel well.

43:38.035 --> 43:41.163
I need to just... I'm gonna lie down.

43:43.957 --> 43:45.000
I'm just gonna...

43:54.635 --> 43:56.011
This far enough down?

43:57.471 --> 43:58.638
I think so.

43:58.639 --> 44:00.473
Now, will it hold your ass?

44:00.474 --> 44:02.559
That I don't know.

44:07.439 --> 44:09.358
Mechanical!

44:09.942 --> 44:11.526
Stop!

44:11.527 --> 44:13.153
- Fuck.
- Shit.

44:14.196 --> 44:15.030
Come on.

44:20.702 --> 44:22.370
There's no brake, is there?

44:22.371 --> 44:25.165
There's the cable,
and there's the end of the cable.

44:28.001 --> 44:29.920
At least we'll die in the Down Deep.

44:48.355 --> 44:49.815
Give me your hand!

45:13.881 --> 45:15.007
Watch out.

45:16.758 --> 45:17.843
Fuck!

45:20.012 --> 45:22.306
- There they are!
- Get them!

45:26.435 --> 45:27.436
Watch out!

45:46.914 --> 45:48.748
- Fuck!
- <i>They got through, sir.</i>

45:48.749 --> 45:50.124
I noticed.

45:50.125 --> 45:51.584
Keep this channel clear.

45:51.585 --> 45:53.253
Sheriff Billings, do you copy?

45:55.589 --> 45:56.881
Sheriff Billings.

45:56.882 --> 45:57.965
<i>Yes, Mr. Mayor?</i>

45:57.966 --> 45:59.300
Sheriff, I regret to inform you

45:59.301 --> 46:02.261
that the fugitives from Mechanical
just became your problem.

46:02.262 --> 46:03.763
I know that as a loyal servant
of the Silo,

46:03.764 --> 46:05.515
<i>I can count on you to bring them in.</i>

46:05.516 --> 46:06.975
Of course, Mr. Mayor.

46:07.809 --> 46:11.772
You can always count on me
to faithfully serve the Silo and the Pact.

46:36.755 --> 46:38.173
Come on.
