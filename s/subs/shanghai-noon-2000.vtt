03:00.931 --> 03:03.976
The princess nodded,
and the frog said,

03:04.476 --> 03:08.272
"That which you have promised,
you must perform."

03:10.941 --> 03:12.234
Very good. Keep reading.

03:13.861 --> 03:17.239
"So the princess leaned in
and kissed the frog,"

03:17.990 --> 03:21.785
"but as she did,
he became a handsome prince,"

03:22.369 --> 03:24.455
"and they rode off to his kingdom,"

03:24.496 --> 03:29.293
"where they lived happily ever after."

03:30.294 --> 03:32.463
Happily ever after.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.925
There's no such thing
as "happily ever after."

03:37.760 --> 03:39.803
Not for a real princess.

03:40.888 --> 03:44.266
The prince my father wants me to marry
will always be a frog.

03:44.308 --> 03:47.895
My offer still stands.
I will help you get to America.

03:48.187 --> 03:50.314
- America?
- That's very kind.

03:50.648 --> 03:52.441
But we're running out of time.

03:52.524 --> 03:55.861
I know of a ship bound for America,
but we must leave tonight.

03:55.945 --> 03:57.821
- Leave tonight?
- We must hurry, Princess.

04:06.497 --> 04:08.165
Hurry, Princess.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.062
Mung Goo Hi.

05:13.397 --> 05:15.024
Zhou Hei.

05:15.566 --> 05:16.900
Chow Lu.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.951
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, that's it.

06:48.992 --> 06:52.162
Okay. Great. Great. Okay.

06:52.246 --> 06:54.998
Come here. Look at this.
Spent a lot of time on this.

06:55.040 --> 06:57.334
Now, pay attention,
'cause I don't want any mistakes.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.878
Now, I've calculated the speed of
the train and the speed of our horses.

06:59.962 --> 07:02.214
We meet at this vector.
The only variable is the wind.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.419
Technically, if you travel
over here on the horses...

07:04.466 --> 07:05.509
Is this the train?

07:18.522 --> 07:21.900
All right. We're just gonna wing it,
like we always do.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.027
Ride down, jump on the train,

07:24.111 --> 07:26.864
hoorah the money,
head back to the cathouse, all right?

07:26.905 --> 07:29.533
Let's go. Come on. Move out. Go!

07:30.701 --> 07:33.871
You okay? Nervous? It's all right
to be nervous when you're new.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.039
You'll be okay. I'll keep an eye on you.

07:36.165 --> 07:39.168
All you gotta do is follow my lead.
All right, look alive, outlaws!

07:45.549 --> 07:49.511

Reach for the sky,
ladies and gentlemen!

08:13.243 --> 08:15.913
Touch that gun
and I'll blow your goddamn head off!

08:15.996 --> 08:17.247
What are you doin'?

08:17.289 --> 08:19.041
I sorta like to be the only guy
that talks, Wallace.

08:19.082 --> 08:21.376
- All right. I'm sorry.
- That's okay. That's okay. Good.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.921
Don't worry. Come on, come on.
Big 'Un, let's go.

08:23.962 --> 08:26.131
Why is the new guy talking?
Where did you get this guy?

08:26.215 --> 08:29.426
You know I'm the only one who talks.
Okay, everybody keep calm.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.595
You think you're gonna
shoot me? Is that right?

08:31.720 --> 08:34.431
What you got right in here?
Yeah, you got this gun?

08:34.515 --> 08:36.475
You think you're gonna
do something with that gun?

08:36.517 --> 08:38.894
Come on, lady bird.
You got anything besides yarn?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.523
- You got it out for me!
- Hey!

08:42.606 --> 08:44.900
No.

08:44.942 --> 08:47.444
Come here. Come here.
We don't steal from women.

08:47.528 --> 08:49.905
Get over here. Take that side.

08:51.031 --> 08:53.617
Give me your hand. Give me your hand.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.954
I'm so sorry about that. I apologize.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.790
First time you've seen an outlaw?

09:01.124 --> 09:03.585
Scared? Kind of excited, too?

09:03.835 --> 09:06.213
All mixed up? Yeah.

09:08.298 --> 09:11.343
Last train we robbed, we were naked,
it was so hot out.

09:12.135 --> 09:13.637
That was somethin'.

09:16.139 --> 09:17.975
Yeah, it's got my initials right there.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.645
What are you lookin' at?

09:24.523 --> 09:27.359
Wait! Stop! Where did you get this guy?

09:27.776 --> 09:30.654
- Texas.
- Texas? Are you insane?

09:30.737 --> 09:33.115
Just shoot me now, 'cause I don't
understand what we're doing here.

09:33.365 --> 09:36.994
Sir, sir, sir, sir. Come here,
come here, come here. Sit down.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.662
- Excuse me.
- Sir, sit down.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.505
What happened?

09:48.547 --> 09:51.300
- Wallace, what are you doing?
- I'm just wingin' it.

09:51.675 --> 09:54.177
No! That's not how we wing it!

09:54.261 --> 09:57.014
No more winging it!
Stop! Come on, Big 'Un.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.599
You've lost your "winging it" privileges.

09:58.682 --> 09:59.891
Damn.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.435
Damn!

10:39.723 --> 10:44.102
Who killed my uncle? Who did this?

11:14.925 --> 11:17.386
Give me the dynamite.
Give me the dynamite.

11:17.427 --> 11:19.805
No, no, no, no. You stay here.
You don't get to come.

11:19.888 --> 11:23.475
- Keep an eye on wing nut.
- Hey, Blue, looky here!

11:36.446 --> 11:37.531
Okay.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.119
Who killed my uncle?

11:42.452 --> 11:45.330
What in the hell is this,
the Orient Express?

11:47.499 --> 11:49.292
- Get him!
- Come here!

12:35.464 --> 12:39.009
What? Hey!
The safe's getting ready to blow!

12:39.050 --> 12:41.011
Get ready to reap the fruits of our labor.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.086
Move it! Let's go!

13:16.421 --> 13:20.008
Roy, you just blew
the shit out of our fruits.

13:26.389 --> 13:27.933
Oh, shit.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.024
We got a Chinaman to catch.

13:40.946 --> 13:42.906
Stop! Stop!

13:46.952 --> 13:49.830
Stop! Stop! Turn around!

13:51.248 --> 13:52.457
Turn around!

13:57.754 --> 13:59.172
What the...

14:00.382 --> 14:02.926
- Who are you?
- Hey, Roy!

14:03.218 --> 14:07.347
- Don't you worry about a thing!
- I got you covered!

14:07.430 --> 14:09.432
No! No!

14:17.232 --> 14:18.942
Roll, baby, roll!

14:47.762 --> 14:51.641
Reach for the sky,
O'Bannon! It's my gang now!

15:16.041 --> 15:18.001
I don't understand.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.212
You said your friend had a large estate.

15:21.504 --> 15:22.964
He does.

15:23.673 --> 15:26.968
- What exactly does he do?
- Well, you could say

15:27.010 --> 15:28.970
he's a philanthropist.

15:29.012 --> 15:32.390
He helps Chinese immigrants
get back on their feet.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.431
Welcome to America, Princess.

16:14.849 --> 16:15.976
Lo Fong.

16:18.853 --> 16:20.814
Forgive me if I do not bow.

16:21.022 --> 16:24.150
Calvin, this man is a trai...

16:25.235 --> 16:26.736
Traitor.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.990
Why? Because he ran away
from the Forbidden City?

16:40.000 --> 16:43.086
Your reward is on the table,
Mr. Andrews.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.811
Well, now you're gonna have
to double it, or I'm gonna kill her.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.233
One thing about the Chinese,
Mr. Andrews...

17:11.614 --> 17:14.159
We do not renegotiate.

17:28.548 --> 17:31.384
Whatever you think
I'm going to do for you,

17:33.803 --> 17:35.346
you're wrong.

17:36.848 --> 17:39.267
It was just like a nightmare.

17:39.559 --> 17:42.312
You wouldn't believe it if I told you.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.147
My gang left me in the desert.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.358
I felt like all the other cowboys
hated my guts.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.488
Everyone was... I just missed you.
I missed all of you.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.990
We missed you, too, Roy.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.159
I think it's medication time.

18:00.497 --> 18:02.791
Come here, devil woman.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.671
That's naughty.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.217
Careful. Careful with that.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.886
Careful.

18:24.646 --> 18:27.398
Holy crap!
The vultures are eating my head!

18:30.443 --> 18:33.738
Help! Help! My gang buried me!

18:34.322 --> 18:36.157
They left me for dead!

18:39.702 --> 18:42.539
Thank heavens.
I thought you were a mirage.

18:43.248 --> 18:46.709
- Oh, come on. Water.
- You.

18:51.214 --> 18:53.383
- You killed my uncle!
- Bull!

18:53.424 --> 18:55.718
That was Wallace all the way.

18:56.553 --> 18:59.597
- He was one of your bandits.
- He wasn't part of my gang.

18:59.681 --> 19:02.225
He was a new guy.
He's crazy as a road lizard.

19:02.934 --> 19:06.688
- You deserve to die.
- Hold on a second.

19:07.438 --> 19:09.732
You know what no one's saying here?

19:09.816 --> 19:12.735
I had a chance to kill you
on that train, and I chose not to.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.738
'Cause I'm not a barbarian.

19:15.780 --> 19:19.325
- Hey! Where are you going?
- Carson City.

19:19.409 --> 19:22.996
I'm closer to diggin' myself to China
than you are to gettin' to Carson City.

19:24.247 --> 19:26.249
- Hey!
- Which way?

19:26.457 --> 19:29.544
Hey, that's better.
Dig me out and I'll show you.

19:33.756 --> 19:34.924
Which way?

19:39.971 --> 19:42.140
You see the mountains over there?

19:43.600 --> 19:45.894
Carson City is on the other side.

19:47.770 --> 19:50.982
All right, dig me out.
I kept my end of the bargain.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.861
Dig me out.

19:56.279 --> 19:57.780
Dig.

19:59.449 --> 20:02.076
Hey! Hey!

20:03.578 --> 20:06.623
- Come on!
- Don't talk. Just dig.

24:48.988 --> 24:49.989
Hey!

26:21.038 --> 26:24.834
Where is Carson City?

29:06.036 --> 29:07.997
- How.
- How.

29:09.999 --> 29:11.584
- How.
- How.

29:11.667 --> 29:15.588
- How. How. How. How.
- How.

30:50.516 --> 30:52.935
I thought you might be hungry.

30:58.566 --> 30:59.900
You were wrong.

31:00.609 --> 31:03.112
You would find me a much better host

31:03.195 --> 31:06.282
if we could come
to some sort of an arrangement.

31:09.243 --> 31:10.953
An arrangement?

31:11.745 --> 31:15.040
Like the one you have with the slaves
working on this rail road?

31:17.042 --> 31:18.961
These people are free to leave.

31:21.505 --> 31:23.632
What do you want with me?

31:25.467 --> 31:29.430
Once I have the emperor's gold,
my work will be complete.

31:33.767 --> 31:34.810
Princess.

31:39.481 --> 31:41.650
I think it is time for you
to be among your people.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.369
They don't look like any lnjuns
I ever seen, Jedediah.

31:52.453 --> 31:54.330
That's because
they're not lnjuns, woman!

31:54.413 --> 31:55.414
They're Jews!

33:19.248 --> 33:21.667
You, stay.

33:51.488 --> 33:53.449
Fellas, get a load of this.

34:03.709 --> 34:04.752
How.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.643
Is this Carson City?

34:23.353 --> 34:25.813
No, this ain't Carson City, Chief.

34:25.856 --> 34:29.318
You're gonna have to get
your firewater somewhere else.

35:12.236 --> 35:14.530
All right, Roy, ante up.

35:28.710 --> 35:30.420
And stay out!

35:42.683 --> 35:45.060
You bounce back fast, kimosabe.

35:56.947 --> 35:59.507
What are you doin' here? I thought
you were going to Carson City.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.536
You! You gave me bad directions!

36:02.578 --> 36:04.580
No, I gave you wrong directions.

36:05.873 --> 36:07.249
You want your toothpicks back?

36:09.668 --> 36:11.378
You got a lot of nerve,
comin' in here with that...

36:11.420 --> 36:12.921
Give it back to me!

36:24.016 --> 36:25.267
Ain't that somethin'?

36:28.896 --> 36:30.272
Take your hand off me.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.621
Hey, I just want to go to Carson City!

37:20.239 --> 37:21.865
You're goin' for a ride!

37:58.026 --> 37:59.361
No!

38:08.036 --> 38:09.496
Yes! Yes!

38:12.666 --> 38:13.875
Yes! Yes!

38:15.460 --> 38:16.670
No! No!

38:18.046 --> 38:20.215
Sorry! I'm sorry!

38:20.257 --> 38:21.717
You!

38:40.027 --> 38:43.238
- Who in the hell started this?
- The Chinaman.

38:48.744 --> 38:51.580
Let me out! Give me the book back!

38:51.621 --> 38:53.332
I have to go to Carson City

38:53.415 --> 38:54.624
to rescue the princess!

38:54.708 --> 38:57.711
You've got the wrong person!
I don't belong here!

38:57.753 --> 38:59.921
Hey!

38:59.963 --> 39:01.089
Keep goin' with the Chinese.

39:01.173 --> 39:02.966
That's workin'.
They're about to let you out.

39:03.050 --> 39:04.092
Give me the book back!

39:04.134 --> 39:06.887
For cryin' out loud,
just give him the book back, please.

39:06.928 --> 39:07.971
If it'll give us some peace and quiet...

39:08.055 --> 39:09.295
- Open it up!
- Forget about it.

39:09.306 --> 39:10.599
They're not givin' you the book back.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.434
- Drop the book.
- I wasted enough time with you.

39:12.476 --> 39:14.561
What? You've wasted
enough time with me?

39:14.603 --> 39:16.003
- What about me?
- Give me the book!

39:16.063 --> 39:18.231
- Listen for a second. Stop!
- Give me the book! Hey!

39:18.273 --> 39:21.735
Listen! Stop!
You're not in the East, okay?

39:21.777 --> 39:25.614
You're not in China. This is the West.
The sun doesn't rise here, it sets here,

39:25.697 --> 39:27.282
and you're closer to getting us hung

39:27.366 --> 39:29.451
than you are
getting that book back, okay?

39:31.203 --> 39:34.956
Now, just... I like that.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.250
That's what I'm talking about.
You're wound so tight.

39:37.292 --> 39:40.128
You're the most irritable guy I've ever
been around. Just relax for a second.

39:40.170 --> 39:43.131
Take ten minutes, and then you can go
back to screaming, I promise.

39:43.215 --> 39:45.967
I'll join you.
Okay, just relax for a second.

39:48.428 --> 39:49.679
Come on, sit down.

39:52.682 --> 39:54.101
Come on.

39:59.523 --> 40:01.108
Just relax.

40:02.984 --> 40:04.152
Is that relaxed?

40:05.320 --> 40:07.489
You look sort of rigid there.

40:08.990 --> 40:11.159
You know what?
We got off on the wrong foot.

40:11.243 --> 40:13.286
Let's try to start again.

40:14.663 --> 40:17.332
Man, you sure can fight.

40:17.416 --> 40:19.668
I've never seen anything like that.

40:20.919 --> 40:22.337
It was...

40:22.963 --> 40:24.548
I'm trying to give you a compliment.

40:26.174 --> 40:29.302
You're not still mad about me pointin'
you in the wrong direction, are you?

40:29.344 --> 40:32.889
Come on. You gotta be able
to laugh at stuff like that.

40:32.973 --> 40:34.266
Like me in the desert.

40:34.349 --> 40:36.560
I don't hold any grudges.
I laugh about it.

40:36.643 --> 40:39.855
I'm not angry at you. You just
left me there with chopsticks to die.

40:39.938 --> 40:44.317
Roy, all by his lonesome. Just me
and the buzzards pic: Kin' at my head.

40:46.611 --> 40:49.364
You're a very silent man, aren't you?

40:50.198 --> 40:52.409
You weren't expecting to see
old Roy in that bar, were you?

40:52.492 --> 40:54.536
Be honest. Were you?

40:58.540 --> 41:00.542
Did you really use those chopsticks?

41:00.625 --> 41:02.043
You better believe it.

41:04.004 --> 41:07.215
Now you laugh. That's funny.
I gotta remember that one.

41:07.299 --> 41:09.176
So, who are you?

41:09.885 --> 41:12.846
I'm Imperial Guard
to the Emperor of China.

41:13.722 --> 41:15.390
China.

41:15.432 --> 41:19.895
- What's with the book?
- The book belongs to Princess Pei Pei.

41:19.936 --> 41:21.771
- Who?
- Princess Pei Pei.

41:21.855 --> 41:24.399
She was kidnapped
from the Forbidden City.

41:24.441 --> 41:27.777
Forbidden City?
I like that, the Forbidden City.

41:27.861 --> 41:32.741
A princess kidnapped.
It's so mysterious. Oh, go ahead.

41:32.782 --> 41:35.076
The emperor sent us to get her back.

41:35.118 --> 41:37.412
Us? You mean your friends
from the train?

41:37.454 --> 41:39.247
They are also Imperial Guards.

41:39.289 --> 41:42.584
They have four days
to bring the gold to Carson City.

41:42.626 --> 41:45.420
- What gold?
- The gold for the princess.

41:48.298 --> 41:50.550
The gold... Was the gold on the train?

41:50.592 --> 41:52.093
Yes.

41:56.973 --> 41:58.266
How much gold?

42:00.101 --> 42:01.394
One hundred thousand pieces.

42:04.439 --> 42:07.651
Sir? Sir?
Could you hand us that book, please?

42:07.734 --> 42:09.986
Sir, there's been a mistake. He has...

42:10.070 --> 42:11.571
Sir... Yeah.

42:22.249 --> 42:25.835
We're gonna get that book,
and we're gonna get you out of here.

42:25.919 --> 42:28.755
- You help me escape?
- Yes.

42:28.797 --> 42:31.800
- Why?
- Why? I'm gonna tell you why.

42:31.883 --> 42:34.469
Because there are some things
in this world that are just wrong,

42:34.511 --> 42:37.514
and stealing a princess is one of them.

42:37.597 --> 42:39.641
Yeah. That's wrong.

42:39.724 --> 42:40.767
I'll tell you another thing.

42:40.809 --> 42:42.978
I feel guilty
about leading you up that mountain.

42:43.019 --> 42:45.272
What was I thinking?
How much time did we waste there?

42:45.313 --> 42:48.108
That was stupid.
It wasn't funny. All right?

42:48.149 --> 42:50.485
Now, sit tight and let me figure this out.

42:51.695 --> 42:54.030
All right, come on, Roy.

42:54.114 --> 42:56.324
Maybe... Maybe I pretend to be sick,

42:56.366 --> 42:58.159
then attack the guards
when they come in.

42:58.201 --> 43:00.453
Okay, you mean
the sick prisoner routine?

43:00.495 --> 43:02.831
Yeah. Does that still work in China?

43:02.872 --> 43:04.874
'Cause here it's sorta
been done to death.

43:07.544 --> 43:10.171
- I have another idea.
- No, no, no, no, no.

43:10.213 --> 43:11.256
Here's how you help me.

43:11.339 --> 43:13.508
You stay on your side of the room,
let me figure it out over here.

43:13.592 --> 43:15.677
Okay, you play over there.

43:18.888 --> 43:22.142
Think. Think.
What do we got here? Oh, yeah.

43:22.183 --> 43:23.685
Okay.

43:24.603 --> 43:27.856
We got wood.
We got a wall made out of wood.

43:27.897 --> 43:30.025
That's good. Oh, we got pillows.

43:32.819 --> 43:36.156
We got pillows, sheets.
We got the sheets and the mattress.

43:36.197 --> 43:39.826
Okay, let's put it all together.
Let's think. Add it up, add it up.

43:39.868 --> 43:42.203
What do we got? What do we got?

43:45.123 --> 43:47.375
What are you doing? Stop! Stop!

43:47.417 --> 43:49.586
What are you doing?

43:49.669 --> 43:52.881
- Hold this for me.
- No, no. That's your shirt. You hold it.

43:59.346 --> 44:02.098
I like your energy, but I'm not with you.

44:02.182 --> 44:04.225
When the shirt gets wet,
it doesn't break.

44:04.267 --> 44:05.852
I don't know what that means.

44:06.686 --> 44:08.229
And then...

44:11.650 --> 44:15.070
Okay. And then what...
Then with the wet shirt, you...

44:15.111 --> 44:17.864
You bend the bars. That's the payoff.

44:18.531 --> 44:20.575
Don't waste my time
with stuff like that, okay?

44:20.617 --> 44:23.203
A 2,000-year-old civilization,
that's all you can come up with?

44:23.244 --> 44:25.705
Shame on you. Shame on you.

44:33.797 --> 44:37.550
Come on. Stop, please.
It's embarrassing.

44:49.604 --> 44:52.565
- See? I told you so.
- No, you said, "Wet shirt don't break,"

44:52.607 --> 44:54.275
not "Piss shirt bend bar."

44:56.111 --> 44:58.113
- Twist it.
- Help.

44:58.196 --> 45:00.740
Okay, there. Get it. There you go.

45:02.409 --> 45:04.786
Just one more. Yeah.

45:04.869 --> 45:07.288
You're as strong as an ox!
Go! You can do it!

45:10.291 --> 45:12.752
There, you got it! We're gettin' it!

45:14.254 --> 45:16.464
- Hold it for me. I'll get through.
- Okay.

45:16.506 --> 45:18.967
No, no, no. You hold it
and I'll go through.

45:25.265 --> 45:28.351
No! Not your hand! Stop.

45:29.769 --> 45:31.813
- Hold it.
- Adios, sucker.

45:31.855 --> 45:35.191
- What?
- I'm just kidding. Come on. Go.

45:35.275 --> 45:37.360
I wouldn't leave my old pal there.

45:37.444 --> 45:39.696
Go. Really squeeze.

45:42.282 --> 45:44.325
No, no, no, no. Grab this, grab that.

45:46.035 --> 45:48.163
Work your magic right here.

45:50.915 --> 45:53.960
- Too dry.
- What? Juice it up. Juice it up. Go.

45:54.002 --> 45:56.004
I can't! No more!

45:57.005 --> 45:58.798
Damn it.

46:00.008 --> 46:02.552
Come on out, little Roy.
Work your magic.

46:09.184 --> 46:11.728
- Hurry up.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

46:11.811 --> 46:14.397
- Stop! Don't look at me.
- Relax!

46:16.357 --> 46:18.485
- Relax. It'll come.
- Thanks.

46:18.526 --> 46:21.488
- That helps. Yeah. Good.
- Is that called relax?

46:47.680 --> 46:50.725
Sheriff! Oh, thank God you're here.
Get the guns!

47:00.109 --> 47:02.695
- Get my book!
- I got it!

47:04.906 --> 47:06.407
Who's the pretty lady?

47:06.491 --> 47:09.077
- That's my wife.
- How long you been in this country?

47:09.160 --> 47:11.579
- Four days.
- Nice work.

47:14.707 --> 47:16.209
Hello.

47:17.210 --> 47:19.712
Come on. Let's adios, partner.

47:26.719 --> 47:28.763
Well, best of luck to you.

47:28.847 --> 47:31.766
Guess this is what
your people call sayonara.

47:33.309 --> 47:36.229
Looks like Fido's giving you
some problems there.

47:36.271 --> 47:38.398
You want me to give you a hand?

47:38.439 --> 47:41.442
- No, I can do it.
- Sure, you can.

47:41.484 --> 47:44.112
How is a greenhorn like you
gonna make it to Carson City

47:44.195 --> 47:46.281
and rescue this princess?

47:48.116 --> 47:50.201
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

47:51.870 --> 47:55.123
I can't take it anymore. Watch me do it.

47:57.458 --> 48:00.503
Get it like this and you put it up high.

48:02.797 --> 48:05.550
See? It'll drift back when you're riding.

48:11.055 --> 48:13.099
- All right, I'll do it.
- Do what?

48:13.141 --> 48:16.019
Take you to Carson City,
help you rescue Princess "Pee Pee."

48:16.102 --> 48:18.813
Pei Pei. You do not
care about the princess.

48:18.897 --> 48:21.399
You don't know me very well, do you?

48:23.818 --> 48:25.194
Tell you one thing,

48:25.278 --> 48:28.573
I'd hate to think of an innocent member
of Chinese nobility suffering.

48:29.157 --> 48:30.283
Tell you that.

48:32.994 --> 48:36.456
You people believe in karma
over there, right?

48:36.497 --> 48:38.207
Well, I've been thinking.

48:38.291 --> 48:41.836
There must be a reason
why we keep running into each other.

48:41.920 --> 48:45.715
I've ridden with some terrible men,
just people I couldn't trust.

48:45.798 --> 48:47.508
But when I look at you,

48:47.592 --> 48:51.304
there's something different about you,
and I can see it.

48:52.805 --> 48:54.182
I can see it in your eyes.

48:56.809 --> 48:59.729
It's what the Indians call <i>Chippichawa.</i>

49:00.355 --> 49:03.191
- What's that?
- Chippichawa is nobility.

49:03.232 --> 49:06.319
And you have it in spades.

49:08.363 --> 49:12.200
You've got yourself a partner.
This has nothing to do with gold, okay?

49:13.242 --> 49:15.078
Shake on it.

49:15.745 --> 49:17.830
Why you spitting in your hand?

49:17.872 --> 49:19.999
Well, it's customary, to seal the deal.

49:20.041 --> 49:21.668
Come on. Let's go.

49:28.841 --> 49:30.885
This is gonna be a long journey.

49:35.306 --> 49:38.768
You boys take care now,
you hear? Shalom.

49:42.480 --> 49:45.650
<i>- Shalom.
- Oh. Let's go.</i>

49:50.613 --> 49:52.949
Yee-haw! God damn!

49:53.032 --> 49:56.369
Looks like y'all had a twister
touch down in here.

49:56.411 --> 49:58.913
Roy O'Bannon and his partner
come through town.

49:59.038 --> 50:00.248
Roy O'Bannon?

50:00.331 --> 50:04.127
Roy O'Bannon ain't got no partner,
friend. Roy O'Bannon is dead.

50:04.210 --> 50:05.920
He ain't dead.

50:05.962 --> 50:09.757
He busted out of jail last night
with the Shanghai Kid.

50:09.841 --> 50:12.885
Shanghai Kid?
Roy got a new gang goin'?

50:12.927 --> 50:16.597
That son of a bitch.
That two-timin' son of a bitch!

50:16.681 --> 50:19.600
He double-crossed us with
that Chinaman from the damn train!

50:20.143 --> 50:23.271
Just like that.
See, at kind of a rakish angle.

50:23.354 --> 50:27.483
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- How do I look?

50:27.567 --> 50:31.112
I think you look great.
I think you look like a real cowboy.

50:31.195 --> 50:33.781
Very dapper, red bandana.

50:34.157 --> 50:35.700
Roy O'Bannon.

50:36.868 --> 50:39.829
- My name is Chon Wang.
- John Wayne?

50:39.912 --> 50:42.457
Chon Wang.

50:42.957 --> 50:45.251
- That's a terrible cowboy name.
- Why?

50:45.293 --> 50:47.587
No, come on, that's not gonna work.
That's horrible.

50:47.628 --> 50:51.424
- That's so bad. And so's the ponytail.
- No!

50:55.553 --> 50:58.139
It doesn't look that bad, actually.

50:59.432 --> 51:00.808
Never touch my queue.

51:02.268 --> 51:04.645
That killed!

51:04.729 --> 51:07.482
- We have to go to Carson City.
- Okay.

51:07.523 --> 51:09.817
Now, before we go to Carson City,
I want to teach you some stuff.

51:09.859 --> 51:10.860
Come on.

51:12.987 --> 51:14.739
You just follow me.

51:15.865 --> 51:18.701
- What's that?
- Sensitivity. Increased reflexes.

51:18.785 --> 51:21.704
Now, these are guns. These can be
your best friend or worst enemy.

51:21.788 --> 51:24.165
That's a spin in my left hand.
That's a spin in my right hand.

51:24.207 --> 51:26.501
That's two spins. Now, here,
I'm gonna let you hang onto this.

51:26.584 --> 51:29.837
See? Be careful.
Always be ready. Always be ready.

51:29.879 --> 51:32.298
Now, try to exhale for long-range shots,

51:32.340 --> 51:34.342
inhale for short-range.

51:34.425 --> 51:36.344
All right, now cover up your ears,
'cause this could be loud.

51:36.385 --> 51:38.304
Cover up your ears.

51:52.401 --> 51:55.196
I am like a wild horse.
You can't tame me.

51:55.238 --> 51:58.658
You put the oats in the pen, though,
and I'll come in for a nibble every clay.

52:04.163 --> 52:06.040
But if you ever shut that gate,

52:06.082 --> 52:07.923
I'll jump the fence.
You'll never see me again.

52:21.681 --> 52:25.226
Thing about your husband,
and this is nothing against him,

52:25.309 --> 52:27.353
because I really like him,

52:27.395 --> 52:29.772
he comes from a very
male-dominated society.

52:30.439 --> 52:33.943
<i>Because I wanna be
a cowboy, baby.</i>

52:34.026 --> 52:37.363
<i>With the top down
and the sunshine shinin'.</i>

52:37.405 --> 52:39.740
<i>Cowboy, baby.</i>

52:39.824 --> 52:45.163
<i>West coast chillin' with the Boon's wine
Gonna be a cowboy, baby.</i>

52:45.913 --> 52:48.749
<i>Ridin' at night
'cause I sleep all day.</i>

52:48.833 --> 52:51.294
<i>Cowboy, baby.</i>

52:51.377 --> 52:54.755
<i>I can smell a pig
from a mile away.</i>

52:57.258 --> 52:59.427
Let me put it this way,

52:59.510 --> 53:02.054
my horse is definitely
not my best friend.

53:02.138 --> 53:05.766
<i>That's why they call me
a cowboy, baby.</i>

53:05.850 --> 53:09.020
<i>With the top down
and the sunshine shinin'.</i>

53:09.103 --> 53:10.271
<i>Cowboy, baby.</i>

53:16.152 --> 53:18.613
Now, people start looking at you funny,

53:18.696 --> 53:20.823
all you gotta say is, "Howdy, partner."

53:20.907 --> 53:21.908
Howdy, partner?

53:21.949 --> 53:24.035
Faster than that or people will think
you're slow in the head.

53:24.118 --> 53:25.786
- Howdy, partner.
- Howdy, partner.

53:25.828 --> 53:29.248
- Just follow my lead. Howdy, partner.
- Howdy, partner.

53:31.626 --> 53:34.795
- Howdy, partner.
- Just park it right there.

53:36.047 --> 53:37.673
It's not working.

53:38.216 --> 53:42.637
Some people aren't as tolerant as I am.
Not very friendly today.

53:46.307 --> 53:49.310
John, what are you...

53:49.393 --> 53:52.772
- John...
- Hurt.

53:52.813 --> 53:54.815
Okay. We gotta work on that.

53:56.901 --> 53:59.028
Here you go, John. Straighten up here.

53:59.111 --> 54:01.155
- Roy, it hurts so bad.
- I know, John,

54:01.197 --> 54:03.783
but I'm not gonna walk with you
if you walk like that.

54:03.824 --> 54:05.493
I'll be okay.

54:10.581 --> 54:13.626
- Hey, Roy. It's you.
- Holy shit!

54:14.293 --> 54:17.171
I'm a wanted man. Look at this!
Five hundred bucks!

54:17.213 --> 54:18.693
- That's a lot of money.
- Let me see.

54:19.423 --> 54:21.634
- Nice picture.
- Careful, careful.

54:21.676 --> 54:23.970
Look at this.
Do you know what this means?

54:24.011 --> 54:26.180
- This will drive the girls crazy.
- Really?

54:26.264 --> 54:29.225
Yes, really. Come on, let's get
a couple more of these.

54:29.308 --> 54:31.352
- It's not bad.
- I'm wanted, too!

54:31.435 --> 54:33.229
- What?
- This.

54:35.022 --> 54:37.400
Oh, come on. That's not right.

54:37.483 --> 54:39.527
I know. I'm not from Shanghai.

54:39.610 --> 54:41.696
No! $1,000 for a sidekick?

54:41.737 --> 54:44.407
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Be careful.

54:44.490 --> 54:46.284
Justice system's all screwed up.

54:48.369 --> 54:49.954
Man can't even ride a horse,

54:50.037 --> 54:52.707
and that's a really cool nickname,
Shanghai Kid.

54:52.748 --> 54:54.875
It's like, got a snap to it that...

54:57.211 --> 55:00.548
Trouble. John, come here.
Get over here.

55:02.216 --> 55:04.802
Tie 'em up over here, fellas.

55:04.927 --> 55:06.387
Get in here.

55:10.558 --> 55:12.393
What's going on?

55:14.478 --> 55:16.105
Howdy, partner.

55:20.067 --> 55:23.237
Oh, my God, it's a posse.
They can't be looking for us.

55:23.279 --> 55:26.866
- What's "posse"?
- I think they're passing us by.

55:28.576 --> 55:31.912
It looked like Marshal Nathan
Van Cleef, the psychotic killer.

55:36.334 --> 55:40.755
Roy O'Bannon!
This is Marshal Nathan Van Cleef.

55:40.963 --> 55:43.299
We know you're hidin' in there.

55:43.382 --> 55:45.760
Oh, God, it is him. It is him.

55:45.843 --> 55:47.345
Why don't you throw down
your six-shooters

55:47.428 --> 55:49.764
and come out with your hands up.

55:50.681 --> 55:53.559
And that goes for the scum
you're ridin' with, too.

55:53.601 --> 55:56.937
- He won.
- Roy, Roy, it's okay.

55:57.021 --> 55:59.940
No, it's not okay!
Stop! You don't know this guy!

56:00.024 --> 56:01.108
Let me talk to them.

56:01.150 --> 56:03.944
Remember, we have
to save the princess.

56:04.028 --> 56:05.404
What are you doin'? Stop!

56:09.450 --> 56:12.953
- Go easy, fellas.
- Why are they shooting at me?

56:12.995 --> 56:15.623
What happened to "Mr. Shanghai Kid"?
"Oh, I'm a wanted man"?

56:15.664 --> 56:17.666
- Why?
- 'Cause you're an outlaw.

56:17.750 --> 56:20.586
- I am not an outlaw!
- Stop! You're a bad guy!

56:20.628 --> 56:22.189
Look at that poster.
What does that say?

56:23.589 --> 56:24.840
Drives girls crazy.

56:24.924 --> 56:27.176
Drives girls crazy?
Drives the posse crazy.

56:27.259 --> 56:28.469
Makes them want to hang you,

56:28.511 --> 56:30.262
string you up,
because you're a bad guy.

56:33.057 --> 56:37.561
- You got 20 seconds...
- God! Give us a minute!

56:37.770 --> 56:39.355
Go around back, gentlemen.

56:39.438 --> 56:42.817
Make sure he isn't trying
to pull the saddle over our eyes.

56:43.692 --> 56:47.571
Remember, I want the Chinaman alive.

56:49.990 --> 56:51.367
I'm not a bad guy.

56:51.450 --> 56:53.911
You're a bad guy.
You're with me, you're a bad guy.

56:58.124 --> 56:59.834
Hey, you put me in this situation!

56:59.917 --> 57:02.878
- I'm the good guy, you're the bad guy!
- No! We're both bad guys!

57:02.962 --> 57:05.423
No, only you're the bad guy!
You go out there and tell them!

57:05.506 --> 57:07.091
No! I'm not going out there!
You go out there!

57:07.174 --> 57:08.676
No, you have to go!

57:12.054 --> 57:14.932
- Did I just do that?
- Not bad.

57:15.015 --> 57:19.270
I don't know karate,
but I know "crazy," and I will use it.

57:23.774 --> 57:25.693
What the hell is going on in there?

57:37.580 --> 57:39.081
You Okay?

57:40.958 --> 57:42.626
You just threw me through a window.

57:42.710 --> 57:43.836
You got that gold?

57:45.546 --> 57:48.299
What? Gold? What gold?

57:48.382 --> 57:50.050
Wrong answer.

57:50.468 --> 57:55.306
Wait. I'm... I'm unarmed. I'm unarmed!

57:55.389 --> 57:57.766
No gun. Hold on, no gun. I don't...

57:57.850 --> 57:59.894
I'm unarmed!
You can't shoot an unarmed man.

57:59.935 --> 58:03.397
- Don't worry. I help you.
- No, John. No, no.

58:03.439 --> 58:05.774
John! John...

58:05.858 --> 58:08.402
Fight with honor. You will win.

58:09.904 --> 58:11.655
Are you frickin' insane?

58:11.739 --> 58:13.407
Is that what they teach you
in Imperial Guard School?

58:13.491 --> 58:15.576
- What...
- Pick 'em up.

58:24.627 --> 58:26.921
Well.

58:27.922 --> 58:30.049
If it ain't the Shanghai Kid.

58:32.176 --> 58:34.678
How about we make the Kid dance?

58:35.888 --> 58:38.349
Oh, come on!
You can do better than that.

58:43.979 --> 58:46.273
You robbed the wrong train, son.

58:54.573 --> 58:57.785
- Look, Marshal, I think that if...
- Just shut up and put on your guns.

59:05.626 --> 59:08.629
This is serious, you know?

59:09.547 --> 59:10.714
We don't come back from this.

59:10.798 --> 59:13.092
That's the general idea.

01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:30.628
What the hell you doin'?

01:00:34.882 --> 01:00:36.884
Stop procrastinating.
Come on. Hurry up, son.

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:40.804
Stop it! I'm not gonna let you
cheapen it. All right?

01:00:40.888 --> 01:00:43.390
This is a duel. It's a sacred thing.

01:00:43.474 --> 01:00:46.310
It's beautiful.
It's what separates us from the animals.

01:00:46.727 --> 01:00:49.104
Yeah.

01:00:51.732 --> 01:00:55.611
I do not envy you. You ready?

01:00:56.111 --> 01:00:58.447
Why don't you turn
and face me like a man?

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:01.617
Why don't you do it your way
and I'll do it my way? How about that?

01:01:07.623 --> 01:01:09.792
<i>Oh, come on, Roy.
You can do it.</i>

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:11.752
<i>No, you can't. He's gonna kill you.</i>

01:01:20.386 --> 01:01:23.764
<i>- One.
- He's gonna blow you away.</i>

01:01:23.806 --> 01:01:25.808
<i>Come on, Roy. Don't think like that.</i>

01:01:31.230 --> 01:01:32.856
Two.

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:35.442
<i>Oh, yeah. Be positive.</i>

01:01:35.484 --> 01:01:38.195
<i>Be the bullet. Be the lead bullet.</i>

01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:46.954
<i>- I'm about to die.</i>
- Three.

01:01:46.995 --> 01:01:48.706
Roy!

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.001
Duel's off!

01:01:55.963 --> 01:01:57.840
Roy!

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:01.009
You blew it, John!

01:02:01.093 --> 01:02:03.846
Never interrupt a man
in the middle of a duel.

01:02:03.929 --> 01:02:08.308
I had him. That's what kills me.
I had him! I had him!

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:19.486
Now you know how it feels
to haul you around in that sedan chair.

01:02:20.738 --> 01:02:22.156
I will never bow to you.

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:28.662
Take a good look at these faces.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.957
If you attempt to escape,

01:02:31.999 --> 01:02:34.877
I will kill one worker every hour

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:37.171
until you are found.

01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:45.387
Starting with this one.

01:02:54.396 --> 01:02:56.440
Do not let him see you suffer.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:00.694
I know who you are.

01:03:03.071 --> 01:03:05.699
Please, tell no one.

01:03:08.994 --> 01:03:11.288
You call this a special hideout?

01:03:12.748 --> 01:03:14.208
Yes, it is, John.

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.960
It's also a good place
to gather intelligence,

01:03:17.044 --> 01:03:19.004
'cause no one
passes through Carson City

01:03:19.046 --> 01:03:21.256
without these people hearing about it.

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.883
Would you ask them
about the princess?

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:24.468
Yes, sir, I will.

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:26.637
And I don't care how ugly it gets.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.180
I'm not gonna rest until I've pumped

01:03:28.222 --> 01:03:30.599
everybody in there
for information, okay?

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:35.145
- Hi, Roy.
- Hello, ladies.

01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:36.230
Roy.

01:03:36.271 --> 01:03:38.065
Make way for a couple of desperados.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:40.150
Nice to see you again, Mr. O'Bannon.

01:03:40.234 --> 01:03:42.236
- Greetings. Hello.
- Roy.

01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:47.115
Oh, yeah, we're gonna get
some information here. Trust me.

01:03:48.534 --> 01:03:50.577
This is not a proper hiding place.

01:03:50.619 --> 01:03:53.580
Oh, come on, John.
Let's relax for a little bit.

01:03:53.664 --> 01:03:56.500
- Here, have a drink.
- No. I wanna find the princess.

01:03:56.583 --> 01:04:01.255
So do I, but we can't exactly go door
to door in Carson City looking for her.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.466
- Don't forget, we're wanted men.
- Only because of you.

01:04:04.550 --> 01:04:07.344
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everything's my fault.

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:14.810
So, what's the princess like?

01:04:14.893 --> 01:04:16.979
John, what's the princess like?
Is she pretty?

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:20.482
- Is she a pain in the neck?
- You are not fit to talk about her.

01:04:20.566 --> 01:04:23.277
John, you better
remember where you are.

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.613
This is the West.
It's not the East. Remember?

01:04:26.697 --> 01:04:28.532
And the sun may rise
where I come from...

01:04:28.615 --> 01:04:30.617
Blah, blah, blah. I know.

01:04:30.701 --> 01:04:32.703
Good. You remember.

01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:34.621
- Is she single?
- What?

01:04:34.663 --> 01:04:38.000
Is she single? Is she married?
Is she available?

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:41.378
Only to a member of the Imperial family.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:48.176
Are you a member of the Imperial
family? I don't think so.

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:52.347
Was that a joke, John? That was a joke.

01:04:52.431 --> 01:04:56.018
John, that was your first joke.
We gotta have a toast. Your first joke.

01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:57.519
- Yes.
- No.

01:04:57.603 --> 01:05:00.814
Yes. Come on. Drink.

01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:02.524
- Just one.
- Okay.

01:05:03.275 --> 01:05:05.569
But don't talk about
the princess anymore.

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:07.279
Word of honor.

01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:14.328
Be fun to play a drinking game.

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:16.705
You know any
Chinese drinking games?

01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:17.831
No.

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:21.209
Every country has a drinking game.
You must know one.

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:23.754
Just one?

01:05:43.982 --> 01:05:46.026
<i>- Uno mas?
- Uno... What?</i>

01:05:46.068 --> 01:05:47.194
- One more. <i>Uno mas.</i>
- Okay.

01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:06.088
No! I lost? One more.

01:06:12.803 --> 01:06:14.805
Oh, no! Oh, yeah!

01:06:16.515 --> 01:06:18.433
I'm so lost, John.

01:06:20.394 --> 01:06:22.145
90% of the time, I don't even know

01:06:22.229 --> 01:06:24.231
what I'm doin' out here in the West.

01:06:24.272 --> 01:06:26.900
Terrible outlaw.

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:30.404
- No, you're a good outlaw.
- Stop, please. I'm a screw-up.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:34.324
- No, I am screw-up. Look at my scar.
- No.

01:06:34.408 --> 01:06:37.911
One for arriving late at a guard duty.

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:42.082
One for dropping fighting stick.
You good. I saw you.

01:06:42.124 --> 01:06:43.750
The only thing I'm good at is talking.

01:06:47.045 --> 01:06:50.090
- It's true.
- John.

01:06:50.173 --> 01:06:53.093
Take your hand off me, John.

01:06:57.597 --> 01:06:58.932
One more game?

01:06:58.974 --> 01:07:02.102
No. No more drinking. That's it.

01:07:03.145 --> 01:07:07.274
<i>- Uno mas?</i>
- No <i>mas,</i> John. No <i>mas.</i>

01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:13.196
Roy?

01:07:14.364 --> 01:07:15.824
Roy?

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.830
- Are you coming?
- Fifi?

01:07:23.457 --> 01:07:24.624
<i>Uno mas?</i>

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:50.400
So, who's your funny-looking friend?

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:52.819
I don't know.

01:07:52.861 --> 01:07:55.489
He's this crazy Imperial Guard I met.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:57.532
He's... He's really funny.

01:07:59.159 --> 01:08:00.660
The guy's hysterical.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:03.663
We were just playing... Did you see us?
We were just playing that game.

01:08:03.705 --> 01:08:06.083
John's going...

01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:09.169
And I was going... You can't really
understand what he's saying, but...

01:08:09.211 --> 01:08:13.507
Roy? Roy? I never figured you
for riding with a Chinaman.

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:20.180
Well, I'm not exactly
riding with him, Fifi.

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:24.725
He's not my friend, you know.
I mean, he's a Chinaman.

01:08:25.977 --> 01:08:27.770
Well, that's good.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.357
I mean... And you really...

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:33.693
Were you guys talking
about who he was?

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:35.904
Let's talk about something else.

01:08:42.202 --> 01:08:44.746
Don't you look delicious?

01:08:45.622 --> 01:08:47.624
- What's going on?
- Well.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:50.460
- You!
- If it isn't the Shanghai Kid.

01:08:55.590 --> 01:08:56.883
Here.

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:18.404
Thank you.

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:23.702
Thank you.

01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:25.578
<i>Uno mas?</i>

01:09:29.124 --> 01:09:30.750
John, come on. We gotta get going.

01:09:30.834 --> 01:09:33.670
- The marshal's downstairs.
- No, no, Marshal's in there.

01:09:35.337 --> 01:09:37.340
Oh, man, John. What'd you do to him?

01:09:37.424 --> 01:09:39.009
- Come on. Let's get going.
- No!

01:09:39.091 --> 01:09:40.468
I don't wanna ride with you.

01:09:40.551 --> 01:09:43.054
Come on, John.
Damn, you're a mean drunk.

01:09:44.639 --> 01:09:46.433
- Hi, horsey!
- All right.

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:49.394
- All right, it's time for a "yee-haw."
- Yee-what?

01:09:49.435 --> 01:09:51.770
Roy O'Bannon special.

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:54.774
We jump off, land on the back
of the horse, yell "yee-haw"

01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:57.277
and ride off, all right?

01:09:58.028 --> 01:10:00.947
Watch me and do exactly as I do it.
Yee-haw!

01:10:07.204 --> 01:10:08.663
Yee-haw!

01:10:10.916 --> 01:10:13.501
Okay, hyah! Hyah!

01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:16.004
- Hyah! Where's the head?
- John!

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:18.465
John, get up!

01:10:19.966 --> 01:10:21.301
Tie 'em up.

01:10:21.343 --> 01:10:24.346
What happened to my horse?
Is he dead?

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:26.473
No, but we are, John.

01:10:26.514 --> 01:10:29.726
- Hi, horsey. You sleeping?
- Get up.

01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:38.068
Mighty impressive hardware
you're packin'.

01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:43.657
Why don't you get your eyes off
my package, you twisted son of a bitch.

01:10:48.328 --> 01:10:51.248
- I hope that's him leaving.
- Your turn.

01:10:53.750 --> 01:10:56.044
Thank you, Mr. Van Cleef.

01:10:56.127 --> 01:10:58.838
Well, well. What have we here?

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:03.843
Mr. O'Bannon, I presume.

01:11:04.427 --> 01:11:07.180
Can I get a drink of water?
I got cotton mouth.

01:11:07.264 --> 01:11:09.683
Don't mention it.

01:11:10.892 --> 01:11:14.020
And this must be
the famous Shanghai Kid.

01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:21.569
- Chon Wang?
- Lo Fong?

01:11:21.653 --> 01:11:23.780
You remember
your old comrade-in-arms?

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:25.865
I remember a traitor.

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:28.034
I'm sensing
some bad blood here.

01:11:28.118 --> 01:11:31.955
- Where is the gold?
- Where's Princess Pei Pei?

01:11:32.414 --> 01:11:33.748
Stop.

01:11:33.832 --> 01:11:35.917
Come on. We're men.
We're not pinatas.

01:11:36.001 --> 01:11:39.504
Okay? And we're really hungover.
We're not trying to be tough guys.

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.548
You wanna talk about the gold,
let's talk about the gold.

01:11:41.673 --> 01:11:43.091
So, you have my gold?

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:45.427
- Your gold?
- Yes, we have the gold.

01:11:46.303 --> 01:11:49.180
- Then where is it?
- The gold's in a safe place.

01:11:52.684 --> 01:11:53.893
Is he telling the truth?

01:11:59.733 --> 01:12:01.276
No.

01:12:03.695 --> 01:12:06.573
Nice, John. Way to go.
Way to think on your feet.

01:12:06.614 --> 01:12:09.242
He cannot lie.
He is bound by Imperial decree.

01:12:09.284 --> 01:12:11.411
Imperial decree.

01:12:11.494 --> 01:12:12.662
When are you gonna learn

01:12:12.746 --> 01:12:14.331
you're not in China anymore?

01:12:15.415 --> 01:12:19.002
He will never learn.
He can only follow orders.

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:24.758
At least I still have my honor.

01:12:31.598 --> 01:12:33.767
Slaves have no honor.

01:12:35.060 --> 01:12:36.102
- No! No!
- Hey!

01:12:40.982 --> 01:12:42.942
Now you can never go back to China.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:49.866
You blew it. You blew it, man.

01:12:50.492 --> 01:12:53.620
You do not want to cut
his hair off, trust me.

01:12:54.412 --> 01:12:56.164
Nothing personal, boys.

01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:00.960
My loyalty is to the emperor.

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:04.214
Yeah, John, I heard
all about the emperor.

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:07.300
Must be a hell of a man.

01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:09.803
He's only 12.

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:13.898
Are you kidding me? You're sitting here
with a noose around your neck,

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:16.434
ready to die for someone whose balls
haven't even dropped?

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:22.899
By virtue of the authority vested
in me through the territory of Nevada,

01:13:22.982 --> 01:13:26.319
I do hereby order these men
to hang by their necks

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:28.196
until their feet quit kicking.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:37.205
You're goin' to hell, boys,

01:13:37.288 --> 01:13:39.541
and your horses are taking you there.

01:13:39.833 --> 01:13:41.668
Tighten 'em up.

01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:44.212
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

01:13:44.295 --> 01:13:48.341
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

01:13:48.425 --> 01:13:51.428
Hang 'em! Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:57.016
Hey! Watch it, you little punk.

01:13:57.058 --> 01:14:01.354
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

01:14:01.396 --> 01:14:04.899
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

01:14:04.983 --> 01:14:06.401
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:09.529
Hang 'em! Hang 'em!

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:16.911
John, what are you doing?

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:36.139
What the hell is goin' on here?
Stop those horses!

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:37.390
Stop them!

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:46.316
Pull it! Pull it!

01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:50.695
<i>I'm back.</i>

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:55.617
<i>I'm back in the saddle again.</i>

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:56.784
Help me!

01:14:57.535 --> 01:14:59.078
<i>I'm back.</i>

01:15:01.581 --> 01:15:03.708
<i>I'm back in the saddle again.</i>

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:08.630
Well, don't just stand there!
Go after them!

01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:18.932
Will you listen to this creek, John?

01:15:19.015 --> 01:15:21.267
I've never noticed
what a beautiful melody a creek makes.

01:15:23.311 --> 01:15:25.271
I've never taken the damn time.

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:28.691
Look at these mountains
and these trees.

01:15:28.775 --> 01:15:30.276
Hell, look at these green trees.

01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:31.653
Come here.
I don't even know the names...

01:15:31.736 --> 01:15:34.155
We're gonna learn the names
of these green trees. Come here.

01:15:34.239 --> 01:15:36.366
I want you to look at these.

01:15:37.075 --> 01:15:39.118
Can we not...
John, what are you doing?

01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:41.454
Are you still worried about your hair?

01:15:41.496 --> 01:15:44.541
John, listen to me. You're very vain.

01:15:44.624 --> 01:15:47.627
By the time you're 70,
your queue, your ponytail,

01:15:47.669 --> 01:15:49.712
will be as good as new.

01:15:49.796 --> 01:15:51.965
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaving.

01:15:52.048 --> 01:15:54.968
Can we not take two seconds, John?
We just cheated death.

01:15:55.009 --> 01:15:58.304
Come on. Let's look at
these mountains for a second.

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:00.557
Okay, let me get my stuff.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.559
- God, you're unbelievable.
- I'm going alone.

01:16:08.690 --> 01:16:12.151
What are you...
John, what are you talking about?

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:16.072
- I heard you.
- You heard me. Okay.

01:16:16.155 --> 01:16:17.907
At Goldie's.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.536
You said I wasn't your friend.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:25.999
John...

01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:28.918
Hold on a second, John.
I was talking to a girl.

01:16:29.002 --> 01:16:30.837
It was... That's taken out of context.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.338
- That's not...
- Roy.

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:36.342
You were right.
How could I ever be your friend?

01:16:36.843 --> 01:16:38.678
I'm just a Chinaman.

01:16:39.721 --> 01:16:42.390
Hold on, John. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it to...

01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:43.933
Sayonara, Roy.

01:17:39.113 --> 01:17:40.406
Wait here.

01:17:53.419 --> 01:17:54.754
Please.

01:18:15.692 --> 01:18:17.360
You have come a long way.

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:22.115
I hope the princess you seek
is worthy of such devotion.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:27.704
It is my duty to bring her home.

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:35.294
I even brought her favorite book.

01:18:39.382 --> 01:18:41.676
That's very kind of you.

01:18:44.178 --> 01:18:46.180
But what if you found the princess

01:18:46.264 --> 01:18:49.642
and she did not wish to go back
to the Forbidden City?

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:53.312
Why would she want to stay here?

01:18:54.147 --> 01:18:56.774
Maybe she can do more
for the people here

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:00.820
than she could back in China.

01:19:08.453 --> 01:19:09.829
Princess Pei Pei.

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:16.502
Please, don't draw attention.

01:19:19.338 --> 01:19:21.340
Please. Stand up!

01:19:21.424 --> 01:19:23.342
Princess, you have to come with me.

01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:26.721
I cannot. Fong cannot find me missing.

01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.016
Princess, I cannot leave you here.

01:19:34.896 --> 01:19:37.106
Please, stand up!

01:19:38.483 --> 01:19:40.568
Don't bow! Get up!

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:43.279
Get up!

01:19:44.572 --> 01:19:46.199
You must go.

01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:50.369
If I leave,
Fong will begin to kill the others.

01:19:50.411 --> 01:19:52.955
It is my duty to bring you home.

01:19:54.999 --> 01:19:56.042
I command you to go.

01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:02.381
Go!

01:20:03.216 --> 01:20:04.550
Go!

01:21:11.951 --> 01:21:13.619
Reach for the sky, baldy!

01:21:13.703 --> 01:21:15.872
That's right. It's Roy.

01:21:15.955 --> 01:21:17.665
Am I interrupting?

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:20.543
I followed you. So what?

01:21:20.626 --> 01:21:23.337
What am I supposed to do,
let you wander off? You're a greenhorn.

01:21:23.421 --> 01:21:25.548
You'll get killed out here.

01:21:27.341 --> 01:21:29.886
Come on! We gotta <i>adios</i>
out of here, partner! Come on!

01:21:29.969 --> 01:21:32.471
You gotta stick with me.

01:21:34.432 --> 01:21:36.475
Don't forget, we got a princess to save.

01:23:35.052 --> 01:23:38.347
Give my regards
to the emperor, Princess.

01:23:58.576 --> 01:24:01.328
- Chon Wang?
- Chon Wang?

01:24:01.412 --> 01:24:02.621
Chon Wang?

01:24:07.126 --> 01:24:09.670
That's right,
Johnny Wayne is here.

01:24:11.338 --> 01:24:12.673
Hey, it's me.

01:24:13.382 --> 01:24:15.384
Why did you cut his hair?

01:24:15.468 --> 01:24:17.803
I tried to warn you,
but you wouldn't listen.

01:24:17.887 --> 01:24:20.056
Go on, drop the gun.

01:24:20.139 --> 01:24:21.974
Now, slide it over.

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:33.152
Is that her?

01:24:34.528 --> 01:24:36.530
She's pretty.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:38.824
Grab her.

01:24:40.451 --> 01:24:43.287
Come on. We'll take it from here, guys.

01:25:06.852 --> 01:25:09.021
John, what... John, get up.

01:25:09.105 --> 01:25:11.190
What are you...
I thought we were past this.

01:25:11.232 --> 01:25:13.025
Come on, John.

01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:18.781
Do you see? He will always be a slave.

01:25:35.256 --> 01:25:36.966
This is the West,

01:25:39.385 --> 01:25:40.970
not the East.

01:25:44.056 --> 01:25:46.350
And the sun may rise

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:49.061
where we come from,

01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:52.648
but here is where it sets.

01:25:56.110 --> 01:25:59.655
You want me to translate?
The princess stays.

01:26:00.948 --> 01:26:02.992
The princess stays.

01:26:03.576 --> 01:26:06.412
I grab the gold, you marry the princess.

01:26:06.453 --> 01:26:09.582
We both hang Fong, call it a day.
Mission accomplished.

01:26:12.710 --> 01:26:14.420
Well, well.

01:26:17.423 --> 01:26:20.134
Nice to see we're all churchgoers.

01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:24.138
Son of a bitch! With my own guns!

01:26:25.514 --> 01:26:27.725
Sweet, ain't it?

01:26:36.817 --> 01:26:40.321
How about that? It's a Mexican standoff.

01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:44.408
Only we ain't got no Mexicans.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:04.803
No!

01:27:06.263 --> 01:27:08.015
Princess Pei Pei!

01:28:22.798 --> 01:28:25.050
- I hit you?
- No.

01:28:25.092 --> 01:28:27.594
But you're gettin' really close.

01:28:27.678 --> 01:28:30.222
You've almost killed me,
like, 17 times already.

01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:35.602
Eighteen, 19, 20!

01:28:37.271 --> 01:28:39.273
You're on fire today!

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:22.918
How do you survive out here?

01:30:23.585 --> 01:30:26.130
What's that supposed to mean?
These aren't my...

01:30:26.505 --> 01:30:28.090
These guns are really weird.

01:31:03.292 --> 01:31:05.043
Oh, man.

01:31:08.005 --> 01:31:10.215
Stay low!

01:31:46.084 --> 01:31:48.837
Maybe we should let bygones
be bygones.

01:31:48.921 --> 01:31:50.214
You got off some good shots.

01:31:51.048 --> 01:31:55.469
I got off some good ones.
Let's call it a tie.

01:31:55.552 --> 01:31:57.554
What's the matter, O'Bannon?
Out of bullets?

01:31:57.930 --> 01:32:00.015
No, I got one left.

01:32:01.558 --> 01:32:03.435
Tell you what I'll do.

01:32:03.769 --> 01:32:07.314
I'll take out all my bullets but one.

01:32:07.397 --> 01:32:10.108
And that way, we'll be even. How's that?

01:32:11.652 --> 01:32:13.987
Okay. That sounds fair.

01:32:14.863 --> 01:32:16.114
You'd do that for me?

01:32:17.449 --> 01:32:18.617
Oh, yeah.

01:32:22.329 --> 01:32:24.206
You bet I would.

01:33:45.370 --> 01:33:46.872
We come out on three.

01:33:47.372 --> 01:33:49.916
Okay, but... But let me count.

01:33:52.753 --> 01:33:55.297
Fight with honor. Okay.

01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:57.007
Fight with... Okay. One!

01:33:58.050 --> 01:34:00.969
Two! Two and a half!

01:34:01.053 --> 01:34:02.596
Two and seven-eighths!

01:34:02.721 --> 01:34:03.889
Three!

01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:26.703
How the hell did that happen?

01:35:07.202 --> 01:35:08.870
It's a miracle.

01:35:10.706 --> 01:35:13.125
I am invincible.

01:35:14.751 --> 01:35:16.420
Roy!

01:35:17.170 --> 01:35:20.006
Invincible!

01:36:07.512 --> 01:36:11.183
- Now it's time for you to die.
- Adios, partner.

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:04.069
Roy!

01:37:13.286 --> 01:37:15.163
He took the gold.

01:37:29.469 --> 01:37:32.514
Is that all you care about, is the gold?

01:37:32.597 --> 01:37:34.099
Shame on you.

01:37:35.225 --> 01:37:38.478
There's more to life than money.
I hope you learn that one day.

01:37:38.562 --> 01:37:40.605
What happened?

01:37:40.647 --> 01:37:43.733
What? Nothing, nothing.
I just killed him. How'd you do?

01:37:43.775 --> 01:37:44.943
How?

01:37:44.985 --> 01:37:46.570
What do you mean, how?
I shot him with my gun.

01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:48.572
Come on. Tell me the truth.

01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:51.616
It was unbelievable. You missed
a miracle. I had one bullet left.

01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:53.201
He had, like, a million left.

01:37:53.285 --> 01:37:55.120
He lied to me and told me
that he only had one, too.

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:57.122
But... But when... But when he...

01:38:09.759 --> 01:38:11.803
- She's staying?
- Yes.

01:38:13.138 --> 01:38:15.807
- Can I stand?
- Yes.

01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:22.188
Reach for the sky, O'Bannon!

01:38:22.564 --> 01:38:25.317
That's my line. He stole my gang,
he's stealing my lines.

01:38:25.358 --> 01:38:26.943
- That's unbelievable.
- Roy! Roy!

01:38:27.319 --> 01:38:28.653
Get back!

01:38:29.821 --> 01:38:31.156
Stop, stop. It's Wallace.

01:38:31.573 --> 01:38:32.949
Hey, Roy,

01:38:32.991 --> 01:38:36.661
we know you been moonlightin' on us
with that old yellow fella from the train!

01:38:36.995 --> 01:38:38.875
You guys, you stay here.
This isn't your battle.

01:38:39.414 --> 01:38:42.375
No, we stick together. We are partners.

01:38:45.295 --> 01:38:47.005
That's beautiful.

01:38:52.385 --> 01:38:53.595
You go out the back door.

01:38:54.179 --> 01:38:56.598
- No.
- Don't worry, Princess.

01:38:56.681 --> 01:38:58.892
I promise you, I will see you again.

01:39:00.018 --> 01:39:02.187
That which you have promised,

01:39:02.729 --> 01:39:04.522
you must perform.

01:39:19.996 --> 01:39:21.206
- Get out of the way!
- Why?

01:39:21.873 --> 01:39:23.667
- Come on!
- Why? What are you...

01:39:25.543 --> 01:39:29.047
- What are you doing? Are you crazy?
- No, John, stop, stop.

01:39:29.506 --> 01:39:31.007
They can't touch me.

01:39:31.049 --> 01:39:33.718
Something happened back there.
It was a miracle.

01:39:33.802 --> 01:39:34.886
There's no way...

01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:36.930
Hey, smart-ass! Do you hear me?

01:39:37.347 --> 01:39:39.975
Time's up, O'Bannon!
It's the end of the line!

01:39:40.308 --> 01:39:42.102
We can take these guys.

01:39:42.185 --> 01:39:43.645
Yep, we can take them.

01:39:44.270 --> 01:39:47.649
Are you comin' out or ain't you?

01:39:48.358 --> 01:39:49.401
Gun.

01:39:59.744 --> 01:40:02.247
You really are the Shanghai Kid.

01:40:05.583 --> 01:40:07.669
Nice riding with you, partner.

01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:21.224
We go out on three. I count.

01:40:21.766 --> 01:40:23.560
No, I count.

01:40:24.102 --> 01:40:26.021
We'll both count.

01:40:26.688 --> 01:40:29.315
One, two, three!

01:40:40.035 --> 01:40:43.621
- Indians! Look out!
- No! My family! My family!

01:40:50.462 --> 01:40:53.131
- Friends. Brothers!
- Roy!

01:40:53.339 --> 01:40:58.136
I gotta tell ya, we always
figured you for a dumbshit,

01:40:58.803 --> 01:41:01.848
but we was thinkin' maybe you
wanna come back and rejoin the gang.

01:41:02.557 --> 01:41:05.351
- So, what do you say?
- Yeah, what do you say?

01:41:05.435 --> 01:41:06.675
I think I'm just gonna wing it.

01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:08.646
All right.

01:41:08.730 --> 01:41:10.648
- And you are goin' to jail.
- That works, too.

01:41:14.486 --> 01:41:16.029
How, <i>kimosabe!</i>

01:41:16.404 --> 01:41:18.406
How, <i>kimosabe!</i>

01:41:28.416 --> 01:41:30.460
It's nice to be standing here
next to you.

01:41:30.502 --> 01:41:33.129
I don't think I've ever gotten
a chance to thank you for...

01:41:33.379 --> 01:41:36.049
For saving us so many times.

01:41:36.132 --> 01:41:39.511
I wish you could understand what...
I feel like there's this gap between us.

01:41:39.594 --> 01:41:41.888
It's like, I'm a cowboy, you're an Indian.

01:41:41.971 --> 01:41:43.723
You say "Wampum," I say "money."

01:41:43.807 --> 01:41:45.475
At a certain point, I just think...

01:41:49.979 --> 01:41:52.232
Shut up, Roy. You talk too much.

01:41:52.857 --> 01:41:55.318
Did... Did... She just...

01:42:07.956 --> 01:42:12.377
There she is, right on time,
carrying a big, fat payroll.

01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:19.843
I don't know if I'll ever
get used to this one.

01:42:22.595 --> 01:42:24.222
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.

01:42:24.514 --> 01:42:27.142
I can guarantee you, we won't get half
as many girls being lawmen.

01:42:27.225 --> 01:42:29.310
I know we're spoken for, but...

01:42:29.394 --> 01:42:31.474
You never know what's gonna
happen in a relationship.

01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:36.651
I gotta get rid of my outlaw name.
That's not gonna work anymore.

01:42:36.734 --> 01:42:39.445
Really? What would you call yourself?

01:42:40.405 --> 01:42:43.825
I don't know. I mean,
my real name's Wyatt Earp, but...

01:42:44.159 --> 01:42:47.579
Earp? That's a terrible name
for a cowboy.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:50.123
- Why?
- Bad.

01:42:50.248 --> 01:42:51.624
- Really?
- Bad!

01:42:51.749 --> 01:42:53.960
And John Wayne's
a great cowboy name?

01:42:54.043 --> 01:42:55.170
Roy, look.

01:42:55.670 --> 01:42:56.921
There they are.

01:42:57.797 --> 01:43:01.759
Yep. Look at those amateurs.
That's my move!

01:43:02.427 --> 01:43:04.596
Come on, Roy. Let's go say "howdy."

01:43:04.721 --> 01:43:06.723
Let's go!

01:43:06.764 --> 01:43:08.349
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!

01:43:16.274 --> 01:43:17.775
- Yee-haw!
- Yee-haw!

01:43:24.949 --> 01:43:26.159
<i>Scene up.</i>

01:43:27.869 --> 01:43:31.372
That which you have promised,
you must perform.

01:43:33.208 --> 01:43:35.126
Hello.

01:43:35.376 --> 01:43:37.879
He was part of your "rushimiant..."

01:43:37.962 --> 01:43:39.422
What? Regiment.

01:43:39.631 --> 01:43:41.382
He's one of your bandits.

01:43:41.466 --> 01:43:43.426
He's one of your... He's one of your...

01:43:43.635 --> 01:43:46.638
He was part of your regiment
of "dentists."

01:43:46.679 --> 01:43:48.640
Bandits. Dentists?

01:43:52.769 --> 01:43:54.812
Shit!

01:43:59.275 --> 01:44:01.569
He didn't teeth brush this morning.

01:44:01.653 --> 01:44:04.072
- Lose this thing, too, I'm gonna cut off...
- No!

01:44:09.869 --> 01:44:11.496
I can't do stunts, man.

01:44:11.829 --> 01:44:15.500
<i>Because I'm gonna be a cowboy, baby.</i>

01:44:17.877 --> 01:44:20.630
What's this princess like?

01:44:26.386 --> 01:44:29.180
I got air bubbles coming out of my thing.

01:44:30.014 --> 01:44:31.557
<i>Uno mas,</i> please.

01:44:34.435 --> 01:44:37.814
<i>Uno mas...</i>

01:44:39.065 --> 01:44:40.692
Thanks, Fido.

01:44:55.456 --> 01:44:58.710
One, two, three!

01:45:00.670 --> 01:45:02.171
Shit!

01:45:06.843 --> 01:45:10.346
Thank you so much, Princess.
You're so good.

01:45:10.388 --> 01:45:13.766
Princess! Oh, I love you so much.

01:45:14.058 --> 01:45:17.061
I'm talking to you!
Turn around!

01:45:17.145 --> 01:45:18.980
Ask me if I give a shit.

01:45:29.407 --> 01:45:32.243
<i>I might walk a little funny
but my walk is me.</i>

01:45:32.327 --> 01:45:34.954
<i>I might stutter when I talk
but I say what I see.</i>

01:45:35.038 --> 01:45:37.915
<i>I don't agree with every other
little thing that's proven.</i>

01:45:37.999 --> 01:45:40.710
<i>I do a lot of things
that I shouldn't be doin'.</i>

01:45:40.752 --> 01:45:43.212
<i>I ruin everything
you might've had in mind.</i>

01:45:43.254 --> 01:45:46.174
<i>I'm a consistent, belligerent
solidified mind.</i>

01:45:46.257 --> 01:45:48.718
<i>Rhinestone freak Suburban style.</i>

01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:51.679
<i>I ain't got no money
and I got no car.</i>

01:45:51.763 --> 01:45:54.265
<i>I might make par
if it don't take much.</i>

01:45:54.307 --> 01:45:57.060
<i>I gotta ride very far
'cause I ride on luck.</i>

01:45:57.101 --> 01:45:59.604
<i>I stay pretty stuck
in a rut like I should.</i>

01:45:59.687 --> 01:46:02.607
<i>And I do it for the love</i>
<i>of everything's that's still good.</i>

01:46:02.690 --> 01:46:05.026
<i>I don't know why I come here.</i>

01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:08.071
<i>But I know I'll never leave.</i>

01:46:08.112 --> 01:46:10.948
<i>It's the only place I wanna be.</i>

01:46:11.032 --> 01:46:13.409
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

01:46:35.139 --> 01:46:37.725
<i>I'm a long way gone
but I ain't short-lived.</i>

01:46:37.809 --> 01:46:40.728
<i>I got knee-deep pockets

01:46:40.812 --> 01:46:43.231

01:46:43.314 --> 01:46:45.983

01:46:46.067 --> 01:46:48.653
