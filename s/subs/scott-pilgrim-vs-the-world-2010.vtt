Scott Pilgrim is dating a high-schooler?

00:39.790 --> 00:41.666
Really? Is she hot?

00:41.750 --> 00:44.085
How old are you now,
Scott? Like, 28?

00:44.169 --> 00:46.003
I'm not playing your little games, kids.

00:46.088 --> 00:48.464
So, you've been out of high
school for, like, 13 years.

00:48.549 --> 00:51.217
I'm 22. Twenty-two.

00:52.845 --> 00:55.680
And you're dating a high-school girl.
Not bad, not bad.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.724
Thank you,
thank you.

00:57.808 --> 01:02.186
So, did you guys, like,
you know, do it yet?

01:02.813 --> 01:04.605
We have done many things.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.149
We ride the bus together.

01:06.442 --> 01:10.570
And we have meaningful conversations
about how yearbook club went

01:10.654 --> 01:13.781
and about her friends
and, you know, drama.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.575
Have you even kissed her?

01:15.659 --> 01:18.035
We almost held hands once,
but then she got embarrassed.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.454
Well, aren't you pleased as punch.

01:19.538 --> 01:20.705
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:20.789 --> 01:21.831
So, what's her name?

01:22.583 --> 01:24.542
Knives Chau.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.502
She's Chinese.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.338
Wicked.

01:29.423 --> 01:30.590
So, when do we get to meet her?

01:30.674 --> 01:32.258
Oh, please,
let it be soon.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.177
That's for me.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.806
Hi.
You promise to be good?

01:38.891 --> 01:40.099
Of course I'll be good.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.434
Seriously, please be good.

01:41.685 --> 01:43.102
Am I normally not?

01:43.687 --> 01:46.814
Hey, Knives, this is Stephen Stills.
He's the talent.

01:47.566 --> 01:49.192
Hey.

01:49.985 --> 01:50.985
Is she gonna geek out on us?

01:51.069 --> 01:52.195
She'll just sit in the corner, man.

01:52.488 --> 01:54.322
I mean, I want her
to geek out on us.

01:54.406 --> 01:57.617
She'll geek. She geeks.
She has the capacity to geek.

01:57.701 --> 01:58.868
Okay.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.287
You're good.

02:05.709 --> 02:06.751
Wow.

02:06.835 --> 02:07.877
Here, let me get your coat.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.169
Hi.

02:09.253 --> 02:10.713
Knives, that's Kim.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.007
Sorry, what was your name?

02:13.342 --> 02:14.300
Kim.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.010
And you play the drums?

02:16.720 --> 02:17.762
Yes.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.722
That is so awesome.

02:19.932 --> 02:21.557
Knives, that's Young Neil.

02:21.934 --> 02:24.602
Hi.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.479
What do you play?

02:27.523 --> 02:33.236
Wow, Zelda, Tetris.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.863
That's kind of a big question.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.116
Okay, let's start with
Launchpad McQuack.

02:39.201 --> 02:40.701
That's not the actual title of the...

02:40.786 --> 02:42.537
We are Sex Bob-Omb!

02:42.621 --> 02:44.038
One, two, three, four!

02:50.546 --> 02:52.380
Yeah, yeah

02:53.215 --> 02:54.757
Yeah, yeah

02:55.509 --> 02:57.760
Laminate the stasis

02:57.845 --> 03:00.638
Mama, mama serpentine

03:00.722 --> 03:03.307
I got a breathalyzer

03:03.392 --> 03:05.852
And my body's clean

03:12.901 --> 03:15.027
Yeah! Yeah!

03:40.637 --> 03:42.179
Thank you!

04:03.952 --> 04:05.494
Get ready

04:07.539 --> 04:08.623
Yeah

04:24.389 --> 04:28.517
Yeah, yeah

04:33.649 --> 04:36.317
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

04:36.401 --> 04:37.777
Yeah!

04:42.658 --> 04:45.910
You guys are so

04:47.829 --> 04:50.122
amazing.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.624
She seems nice.
Yeah.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.833
Yeah, she seems awesome.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.085
Yeah.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.629
Scott, if your life had a face,
I would punch it.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.756
Yeah. Wait, what?

04:58.840 --> 05:01.801
I mean, are you really happy
or are you really evil?

05:02.469 --> 05:04.220
Like, do I have ulterior
motives or something?

05:04.304 --> 05:05.429
I'm offended, Kim.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.722
Wounded, even?

05:07.265 --> 05:08.307
Hurt, Kim.

05:08.392 --> 05:09.850
You? Hurt?

05:11.103 --> 05:13.354
Neil, you were saying
about "she seems awesome."

05:13.730 --> 05:15.106
Yeah, she seems awesome.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.482
Yeah.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.614
Before you hear some dirty
lies from someone else,

05:23.699 --> 05:25.241
yes, I'm dating a 17-year-old.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.659
Oh, is he cute?

05:28.036 --> 05:30.287
Does this mean we have to
stop sleeping together?

05:30.372 --> 05:32.665
You see another bed in here?

05:32.874 --> 05:35.793
Yeah. You're totally
my bitch forever.

05:44.636 --> 05:47.930
So, the whole 17-year-old thing,
don't tell too many people.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.724
Hey, you know me.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.017
I mean,
don't tell my sister.

05:52.853 --> 05:53.978
You know me.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.271
Who are you texting?

05:57.941 --> 05:59.817
Seventeen years old?
Scandal!

05:59.901 --> 06:01.610
That's not true.
Who told you?

06:01.695 --> 06:02.695
Wallace. Duh.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.071
That gossipy bitch.

06:04.448 --> 06:05.489
You know me.

06:05.574 --> 06:06.574
Wallace!

06:07.117 --> 06:08.701
Who is this mystery child you date?

06:08.785 --> 06:10.995
Her name's Knives Chau.
She's Chinese.

06:11.705 --> 06:16.250
A 17-year-old Chinese schoolgirl?
You're ridiculous.

06:16.334 --> 06:17.877
It's a Catholic school, too.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.253
With the uniform and everything?

06:19.421 --> 06:20.713
Yeah.
The whole deal.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.340
Oh, my God.
You guys haven't...

06:23.425 --> 06:26.177
No, no, no, no.
We haven't even held hands yet.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.262
I think she hugged me once.

06:28.346 --> 06:30.389
Scott, why are you doing this?

06:30.474 --> 06:34.143
I don't know. It's just nice,
you know? It's just simple.

06:34.227 --> 06:35.644
It's been over a year
since you got dumped

06:35.729 --> 06:37.980
by She-Who-Will-Not-Be-Named.
So...

06:39.524 --> 06:40.733
Are you legitimately moving on

06:40.817 --> 06:42.526
or is this just you being insane?

06:42.944 --> 06:44.570
Can I get back to you on that?

06:47.616 --> 06:49.575
I do not wanna be here at all.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.660
This school has boys, too.

06:52.162 --> 06:56.248
I hate you. Even I would think
twice about dating a 17-year-old.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.541
Well, she's only allowed out

06:57.626 --> 06:59.668
when the sun is up,
so I wouldn't call it dating.

07:00.212 --> 07:02.046
It's more like... Playtime?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.798
That doesn't sound so good, either. No.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.049
Scott!

07:05.467 --> 07:06.467
Hey, Knives.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.636
This is my cool,
gay roommate, Wallace Wells.

07:08.720 --> 07:09.887
Hi.
He's gay.

07:10.180 --> 07:12.640
Oh, do you wanna know
who in my class is gay?

07:12.724 --> 07:14.225
Yes, does he wear glasses?

07:14.309 --> 07:16.560
Wallace, you go now.
Begone.

07:19.064 --> 07:21.649
You're too good
for him. Run.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.028
Get ready!

07:26.696 --> 07:27.738
Here we go!

07:32.661 --> 07:35.287
Did you know that the original
name for Pac-Man was Puck-Man?

07:35.789 --> 07:37.581
You'd think it was because
he looks like a hockey puck,

07:37.666 --> 07:40.084
but it actually comes from the
Japanese phrase "paku-paku,"

07:40.168 --> 07:41.919
which means,
"to flap one's mouth open and closed."

07:43.672 --> 07:44.755
They changed it because
they thought that

07:44.840 --> 07:46.590
"Puck-Man" would be
too easy to vandalize.

07:46.675 --> 07:47.758
You know,
people could just scratch off

07:47.843 --> 07:49.510
the "P" and turn it
into an "F" or whatever.

07:50.095 --> 07:53.180
Oh, my God!
Like, wow!

07:53.306 --> 07:54.557
Combo!

07:58.186 --> 07:59.186
Yeah. Wow.

07:59.271 --> 08:00.312
Continue?

08:00.397 --> 08:05.776
Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,

08:05.861 --> 08:07.153
three...
Oh, I got it.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.487
...two, one.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.326
I don't listen to that much music.

08:14.411 --> 08:17.538
I mean, I know a lot of kids who play
piano or whatever, but you guys...

08:18.290 --> 08:20.207
You guys rock.

08:20.292 --> 08:21.792
Well, I knew I personally rocked,

08:21.877 --> 08:24.461
but I never suspected
that we rocked as a unit.

08:24.546 --> 08:25.713
So, thank you, Knives.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.048
I mean, you guys
are gonna be huge.

08:28.508 --> 08:29.884
Well, we're already pretty big,

08:29.968 --> 08:31.468
but, yeah, I guess
it'd be cool

08:31.553 --> 08:33.804
if cool people started wearing
our T-shirt or whatever.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.597
Cool.
Yeah, yeah.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.976
Excuse me, do you have anything
by The Clash at Demonhead?

08:39.059 --> 08:42.479
Have you tried the section
marked "The Clash at Demonhead"?

08:42.563 --> 08:44.063
Thank you, Julie.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.649
Are you coming to my party Friday,

08:45.734 --> 08:48.611
or will you be busy babysitting?

08:49.196 --> 08:51.363
Thank you, Julie.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.032
You don't want to listen to her.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.868
And you definitely don't
want to listen to them.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.661
Oh, I heart them so much.

08:57.746 --> 09:01.248
Yeah, I hearted them, too,
until they signed to a major label,

09:01.333 --> 09:05.044
and the lead singer turned into a
total bitch and ruined my life forever.

09:05.128 --> 09:06.670
But that's just me.

09:06.755 --> 09:10.174
Envy Adams is so cool.
Do you read her blog?

09:10.258 --> 09:11.800
Sorry, you were saying about me?

09:11.885 --> 09:14.803
I mean, I've never gone out
with anyone so talented.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.180
Go out with a lot of guys?

09:16.264 --> 09:17.264
No.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.683
Yeah, so, whatever, man.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.602
I've never even kissed a guy.

09:25.440 --> 09:26.649
Hey,

09:27.442 --> 09:28.692
me, neither.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.331
Here you go.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.749
So, this is your secret lair?

09:43.833 --> 09:45.584
Yeah, yeah.
Can I come in?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.629
My secret lair is one of those

09:48.713 --> 09:50.464
"No girls allowed"-type deals.

09:50.715 --> 09:51.799
Okay.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.384
But do you wanna see the
house where I grew up?

09:53.468 --> 09:55.052
Sure!
Come on.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.305
There you go.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.141
Wow.

10:01.476 --> 10:02.476
Yeah.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.812
Wow.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.821
Oh, God.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.117
So alone.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.161
You're not alone.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.621
What?

10:22.706 --> 10:25.457
You're just having some idiotic dream.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.085
Does that mean we can make out?

10:28.169 --> 10:29.962
Oh, God!

10:30.046 --> 10:31.088
What is it, Scott?

10:31.172 --> 10:32.298
I had this totally weird dream.

10:32.382 --> 10:33.590
Oh, God.

10:33.675 --> 10:34.925
What is it,
Other Scott?

10:35.051 --> 10:38.304
Can we skip the dreamtime?
Color me not interested.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.680
But there was this girl.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.056
Girl?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.599
Was this an Envy-related dream?

10:42.684 --> 10:44.268
We don't use the E-word in this house.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.438
No, it wasn't her.
It was somebody new.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.481
Yay for that.

10:49.566 --> 10:50.774
Speaking of new,

10:50.859 --> 10:52.735
weren't you supposed to take
your fake high-school girlfriend

10:52.819 --> 10:54.403
to the library a half-hour ago?

10:54.738 --> 10:56.989
What? It's like 6:00
in the morning.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.828
It's weird.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.455
What's weird?

11:04.539 --> 11:07.291
Libraries remind me of grade school.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.793
That must seem like a
really long time ago.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.546
Yeah, let's talk about something else.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.108
Do you know that girl?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.111
Scott!
What?

11:36.571 --> 11:38.989
You only played one note
for that entire song.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.075
My hand slipped.

11:41.159 --> 11:42.910
Is your girlfriend distracting you?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.745
My girlfriend?

11:44.829 --> 11:46.163
I'll be quieter.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.540
Let's do that one again.

11:48.666 --> 11:49.875
Sorry, what are we doing?

11:49.959 --> 11:51.293
I told you, like,
50 times!

11:51.378 --> 11:53.170
We're going to this party, retard.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.422
Party?
At Julie's.

11:55.507 --> 11:56.507
I thought you guys split up.

11:56.591 --> 11:59.051
We did, but there might be some
label guys there, so, you know...

11:59.135 --> 12:01.011
Oh, man,
this is gonna suck. Suck!

12:01.096 --> 12:03.263
At least it'll give us
something to complain about.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.431
Oh, man!

12:04.516 --> 12:05.641
This sucks!

12:05.725 --> 12:06.809
Sucks!

12:06.893 --> 12:09.937
I'm gonna go pee due to boredom.

12:11.022 --> 12:12.481
I have to pee.

12:12.565 --> 12:14.149
You know, so I told him you've
got a really good sound,

12:14.234 --> 12:15.692
and I think that you
should market your sound

12:15.777 --> 12:18.237
to deaf people, because... Scott! Hey!

12:18.321 --> 12:19.321
Hey, Comeau.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.198
How about this party?
You getting your drink on here?

12:21.282 --> 12:23.117
No, I don't drink.
This is just Coke Zero.

12:23.201 --> 12:24.493
What do you mean,
you don't drink?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.912
I distinctly remember you being very
drunk off a couple of G-and-T's...

12:26.996 --> 12:28.372
Hey, Comeau,
you know everyone, right?

12:28.456 --> 12:30.499
Yeah, pretty much,
I do.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.251
You know this one girl
with hair like this?

12:32.335 --> 12:33.752
Yes, that's Ramona Flowers.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.838
Somebody said she was gonna
be here tonight, actually.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.214
What?
Oh, Scott.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.383
You have the hots for her or something?
I gotta tell you though,

12:39.467 --> 12:40.926
I hear that she's a little hardcore.

13:22.677 --> 13:23.969
Hey, what's up?

13:24.387 --> 13:25.387
Nothing.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.763
Hey, you know Pac-Man?

13:26.848 --> 13:28.348
I know of him.

13:28.641 --> 13:32.019
Well, Pac-Man was
originally called Puck-Man.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.605
They changed it because...

13:34.689 --> 13:36.773
Not because Pac-Man looks
like a hockey puck.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.276
"Paku-paku" means "flap your mouth,"

13:39.360 --> 13:41.945
and that they were afraid
people would change...

13:42.030 --> 13:45.824
Scratch out the "P" and
turn it into an "F," like...

13:48.036 --> 13:49.703
Yeah, that's amazing.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.246
Um...

13:52.457 --> 13:53.624
Am I dreaming?

13:56.211 --> 13:57.669
I'll leave you alone forever now.

13:57.754 --> 13:58.837
Thanks.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.346
Dude!
What?

14:07.430 --> 14:08.680
She's totally real!
Who?

14:08.765 --> 14:10.307
Ramona Flowers.
What?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.476
Dude! What do you know
about Ramona Flowers?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.186
All I know is that she is American.

14:14.270 --> 14:15.312
American.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.813
Why don't you go talk
to Sandra and Monique?

14:16.898 --> 14:17.981
They know a lot more.

14:18.066 --> 14:20.150
Lady-dudes.
What do you know about Ramona Flowers?

14:20.235 --> 14:21.527
I heard she has a boyfriend.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.028
Yeah. Some guy
back in New York.

14:23.238 --> 14:24.821
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What else?

14:24.906 --> 14:27.324
I heard she kicks all kinds of ass.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.910
She's on another level.

14:29.994 --> 14:31.870
She has men dying at her feet.

14:31.955 --> 14:34.581
She's got some battle scars, dude.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.166
What about Ramona Flowers?

14:36.251 --> 14:37.251
You know her?
Tell me now.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.335
She just moved here.

14:38.419 --> 14:39.962
Got a job at Amazon.
Comes into my work.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.004
Does she really?

14:41.089 --> 14:42.756
Didn't you say she just
broke up with someone?

14:42.840 --> 14:43.882
Did she really?

14:43.967 --> 14:45.217
They had a huge fight,
or whatever.

14:45.301 --> 14:46.301
Did they really?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.762
Yes! But I didn't want Scott
to know that, Stephen.

14:48.846 --> 14:50.806
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.058
Scott, I forbid you
from hitting on Ramona,

14:53.142 --> 14:55.435
even if you haven't had a real
girlfriend in over a year.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.940
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Scott's
mourning period is officially over.

15:00.024 --> 15:01.608
He's totally dating a high-schooler.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.652
Dating a high-schooler
is the mourning period.

15:03.736 --> 15:04.861
She's got a point.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.029
I thought you guys broke up.

15:06.114 --> 15:08.865
I don't want you scaring off the
coolest girl at my party, Scott.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.535
We all know you're a total
lady-killer wannabe, jerky-jerk.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.036
That's completely untrue.

15:13.121 --> 15:14.871
That time with Lisa?
That was a misunderstanding.

15:14.998 --> 15:16.915
That time with Hollie?
That wasn't what it looked like.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.041
That time you dumped Kim for...

15:18.126 --> 15:19.918
Okay. Me and Kim are
all good now, all right?

15:21.671 --> 15:24.715
Whatever! Ramona's out of your league.
Let's just leave it at that.

15:24.799 --> 15:27.092
Besides, I'm not even sure
she did have a big breakup.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.344
She keeps mentioning
some guy named Gideon.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.887
Yeah, I don't know what
it is about that girl.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.306
Forget it, Scott!

15:35.977 --> 15:37.686
Guess who's drunk?

15:38.313 --> 15:39.980
I guess Wallace.

15:40.815 --> 15:41.857
You guess right.

15:45.528 --> 15:46.903
So, that girl from my dream...

15:46.988 --> 15:48.238
Girl. Okay.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.740
I saw her at the library.

15:49.824 --> 15:52.451
Library. Can I pretend
we're talking about a guy?

15:52.535 --> 15:55.412
And then I'm at this party
and, hey, there she is.

15:55.496 --> 15:56.747
Hey, there he is.

15:56.831 --> 15:57.789
I think she's...

15:57.874 --> 15:58.915
I think he's...

15:59.000 --> 16:01.126
I think she's the girl of my dreams.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.210
Mmm.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.671
Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.465
I've never been so sure about something.

16:06.549 --> 16:09.051
Then you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.427
What's that?

16:10.511 --> 16:13.430
You should break up with your
fake high-school girlfriend.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.848
I'm not getting it, friend.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.851
You're thinking of juggling two chicks?

16:17.935 --> 16:18.977
Not even!

16:19.062 --> 16:21.396
Well, you should break up with
your fake high-school girlfriend.

16:21.481 --> 16:22.522
Wait, who told you?

16:22.607 --> 16:23.899
Wallace. Duh!

16:23.983 --> 16:25.692
He's not even conscious.
Whatever.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.695
You of all people should know how
sucky it is to get cheated on.

16:28.780 --> 16:29.946
Don't you have a job to do?

16:30.031 --> 16:32.783
You're right. I should send out
a mass text about this. Bye.

16:36.287 --> 16:37.954
Wallace, how do you do that?

16:38.039 --> 16:39.331
Wallace!

16:40.208 --> 16:42.250
Amazon.ca, what's the website for that?

16:42.669 --> 16:44.795
"Amazon.ca."

16:44.879 --> 16:47.130
I have to order something really cool.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.882
You've got mail.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.384
Dude, this thing claims I have mail.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.928
It's amazing what we can do
with computers these days.

16:53.221 --> 16:54.471
Dude, now I'm reading it.

16:54.555 --> 16:55.889
So happy for you.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.517
"Dear Mr. Pilgrim,
it has come to my attention

16:58.601 --> 16:59.935
"that we will be fighting soon.

17:00.019 --> 17:03.063
"My name is Matthew Patel,
and..." Blah, blah, blah...

17:03.731 --> 17:08.276
"Fair warning... Mano y mano...
Seven evil..." Blah, blah.

17:08.986 --> 17:14.156
This is...
This is... This is...

17:14.409 --> 17:15.575
What?

17:15.660 --> 17:17.577
This is boring.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.621
Delete.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.584
Scott,

17:25.545 --> 17:28.046
are you waiting for the
package you just ordered?

17:28.506 --> 17:29.715
Maybe.

17:29.799 --> 17:32.843
It's the weekend. It won't ship
until Monday at the earliest.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.386
You were saying?

17:35.513 --> 17:36.555
Attack hug!
Hey!

17:36.639 --> 17:39.683
Attack hug.
That's so cute. So cute.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.767
You don't remember?

17:40.852 --> 17:43.437
You're supposed to meet me at
the bus stop a half-hour ago.

17:43.938 --> 17:45.188
How could I possibly forget?

17:47.859 --> 17:49.651
Yearbook club is so boring.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.987
I cannot believe the music
they put on while we work.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.071
That's sucky.

17:53.156 --> 17:56.324
Hannah broke up with Alan
and now she's all into Derek.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.702
But then Tamara claims
she has dibs on Derek.

17:58.786 --> 17:59.786
I tell you.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.581
Bad!

18:03.332 --> 18:10.297
Bad!

18:10.381 --> 18:12.591
Okay. I'm sorry,
that was all me.

18:12.717 --> 18:13.967
Solo round!

18:14.844 --> 18:15.844
Uh-oh.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.429
Nega ninja.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.014
Nega ninja!

18:19.348 --> 18:20.432
I can never get past that guy.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.477
Don't beat yourself up about it.

18:23.561 --> 18:24.728
Game over!

18:24.812 --> 18:27.105
Do you want to keep going?

18:27.190 --> 18:29.566
Continue?
Nine, eight,

18:29.650 --> 18:32.736
seven, six, five...
I think...

18:32.820 --> 18:33.862
...four, three...

18:33.946 --> 18:35.238
I think that we should...

18:35.323 --> 18:37.282
...two, one.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.083
Game on, everybody.
Game on.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.460
I got us a show.

18:48.544 --> 18:49.836
Oh, my gosh, when?

18:49.962 --> 18:51.213
Wednesday.

18:51.297 --> 18:53.924
The Rockit. And even better,
it's the T. I. B. B.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.008
Whoa!

18:55.092 --> 18:56.593
The Toronto International
Battle of the Bands?

18:56.677 --> 18:57.677
That's right.

18:57.762 --> 19:00.305
This guy at work was like, "Steve,
you know anybody in a band?"

19:00.389 --> 19:02.098
And I was like,
"I'm in a band."

19:02.183 --> 19:03.850
And he was like,
"You're in a band?"

19:03.935 --> 19:06.269
And I was like, "Yeah,
I am totally in a band."

19:06.354 --> 19:07.437
Great story, man.

19:07.522 --> 19:08.855
Is there a prize or something?

19:09.190 --> 19:11.358
Only a record deal with G-Man Graves.

19:12.068 --> 19:13.902
Who's that?
You don't know?

19:13.986 --> 19:15.779
Indie producer of the millennium.

19:17.156 --> 19:21.868
If we win, it won't just be
Knives wearing Sex Bob-Omb shirts.

19:21.953 --> 19:24.538
It'll be the cool kids, too.

19:24.622 --> 19:25.622
I promise

19:25.706 --> 19:29.501
I will do everything I can to get
out of the study group and come.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.128
I have to pee.

19:32.213 --> 19:33.797
Oh, my gosh,
who are you battling?

19:34.382 --> 19:35.549
Crash and the Boys.

19:35.633 --> 19:38.343
That one band with Crash,
and those boys?

19:38.427 --> 19:39.594
Yeah, that's the one.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.804
I hate them.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.180
Oh, my gosh,
I hate them, too.

19:42.265 --> 19:43.306
Yeah, they suck.

19:43.391 --> 19:44.391
They suck bad.

20:11.460 --> 20:23.346
Hey!

20:28.144 --> 20:29.561
Uh, Scott Pilgrim?

20:29.645 --> 20:31.271
Hi, I was thinking about asking you out,

20:31.355 --> 20:33.106
but then I realized how
stupid that would be.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.733
So, do you want to go out sometime?

20:35.526 --> 20:37.861
No, that's okay.
You can just sign for this, all right?

20:37.945 --> 20:39.905
I just woke up,
and you were in my dream.

20:39.989 --> 20:42.824
I dreamt that you were delivering
me this package. Is that weird?

20:43.075 --> 20:44.159
It's not weird at all.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.243
It's not?

20:45.328 --> 20:46.620
No, it's just that you
have this really convenient

20:46.704 --> 20:48.705
subspace highway running through
your head that I like to use.

20:48.789 --> 20:50.332
It's, like,
three miles in 15 seconds.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.374
Right, right.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.251
I forgot you guys don't
have that in Canada.

20:53.544 --> 20:54.544
You don't
remember me, do you?

20:54.629 --> 20:55.754
We met at the party the other day.

20:56.005 --> 20:57.797
Were you the Pac-Man guy?
No.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.883
Not even.
That was some total ass.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.551
I was the other guy.

21:01.636 --> 21:03.887
You know, you need to sign for this,
whatever this is.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.096
But if I sign for it,
you'll leave.

21:05.181 --> 21:06.306
Yeah, it's how it works.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.308
Okay, well, maybe,

21:08.392 --> 21:11.186
do you wanna hang out sometime?
Get to know each other?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.229
You're the new kid on the block, right?

21:13.314 --> 21:18.526
I've lived here forever, so there are
reasons for you to hang out with me.

21:20.029 --> 21:21.488
You want me to hang out with you?

21:23.115 --> 21:24.658
Yeah, if that's cool.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.994
If I say yes, will you sign
for your damn package?

21:29.497 --> 21:30.872
So, yeah, 8:00?

21:34.335 --> 21:36.002
Why are you just standing there?

21:36.212 --> 21:38.129
Dude, I'm totally waiting on you.

21:38.214 --> 21:40.715
I'm sorry, I just assumed you
were too cool to be here on time.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.634
Oh, you assumed wrong.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.012
So, how did you end up in Toronto?

21:46.097 --> 21:47.430
Just needed
to escape, I guess.

21:47.556 --> 21:48.890
Yeah.

21:48.975 --> 21:50.600
I got this job here,
and Gideon had always said

21:50.685 --> 21:53.144
Toronto was one of the
great cities, so...

21:53.229 --> 21:55.271
Is Gideon your boyfriend?

21:55.606 --> 21:58.358
He's a friend.

21:59.402 --> 22:01.111
Was he your boyfriend?

22:01.445 --> 22:03.613
Do you mind if I don't
get into that right now?

22:03.698 --> 22:06.074
It's so not interesting to me.

22:06.534 --> 22:08.910
So, what about you?
What do you do?

22:08.995 --> 22:11.037
I'm in between jobs at the moment.

22:11.163 --> 22:13.164
Between what and what?

22:13.249 --> 22:18.378
Well, my last job was a long
story filled with sighs.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.547
I know plenty of those.

22:20.631 --> 22:21.881
Is that why you left New York?

22:21.966 --> 22:23.550
Pretty much.

22:23.634 --> 22:25.677
It was just time to head
somewhere a little more chilled.

22:26.220 --> 22:27.846
Well, it's certainly chilled here.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.139
Yeah.

22:29.223 --> 22:31.558
It's chilled,
as in cold.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.059
Yeah.

22:35.521 --> 22:38.523
This is ridiculous.
Isn't it, like, April?

22:38.607 --> 22:39.691
I know.

22:39.775 --> 22:41.735
I can barely see you.

22:41.819 --> 22:44.487
This whole thing is an
unmitigated disaster.

22:44.572 --> 22:48.408
I think act of God is a pretty
decent excuse for a lousy date.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.368
So this is a date, eh?

22:50.494 --> 22:52.412
Did I say date?

22:52.913 --> 22:54.372
Slip of the tongue.

22:54.457 --> 22:55.999
Tongue.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.668
Anyway, night's not over yet.

22:58.753 --> 23:00.670
I think there's a thingy
over here, somewhere.

23:00.755 --> 23:01.755
A thingy?

23:02.757 --> 23:04.466
A door.

23:07.762 --> 23:09.012
Come on.

23:24.695 --> 23:25.945
What kind of tea do you want?

23:26.280 --> 23:27.530
There's more than one kind?

23:28.783 --> 23:31.284
We have blueberry, raspberry,
ginseng, Sleepytime,

23:31.368 --> 23:32.494
green tea,
green tea with lemon,

23:32.578 --> 23:34.079
green tea with lemon and honey,
liver disaster,

23:34.163 --> 23:35.497
ginger with honey,
ginger without honey,

23:35.581 --> 23:37.540
vanilla-almond, white
truffle, blueberry-chamomile,

23:37.625 --> 23:39.918
vanilla-walnut, Constant Comment

23:40.252 --> 23:41.544
and Earl Grey.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.421
Did you make some of those up?

23:44.006 --> 23:45.924
I think I'll have Sleepytime.

23:46.175 --> 23:47.592
That sounds good to me.

23:49.762 --> 23:50.887
Let me get you a blanket.

23:51.263 --> 23:54.140
That would actually be awesome.

24:04.819 --> 24:05.985
Dude, I'm changing.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.822
Sorry.
I'm just cold.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.949
Here, does that help?

24:11.033 --> 24:13.701
Yeah, that's very warm.
What is that?

24:14.578 --> 24:16.496
Okay.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.682
Were you just gonna bring
the blanket from your bed?

24:35.766 --> 24:37.016
I guess.

24:37.101 --> 24:41.688
Maybe we should both get under it,
since we're so cold.

24:43.023 --> 24:45.024
What about our tea?

24:46.861 --> 24:48.278
I can

24:49.321 --> 24:51.072
not have tea.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.623
I changed my mind.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.293
Changed it to what?
From what?

25:03.377 --> 25:06.880
I don't wanna have sex with
you, Pilgrim. Not right now.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.798
Okay.

25:08.883 --> 25:11.134
It's not like I'm gonna send you
home in a snowstorm or anything.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.760
You can sleep in my bed.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.722
And I reserve the right to change
my mind about the sex later.

25:15.806 --> 25:19.392
Well, this is nice.
Just this.

25:19.476 --> 25:21.936
It's been, like,
a really long time,

25:22.021 --> 25:24.439
so I think I needed this,
whatever it is,

25:24.523 --> 25:26.608
so thank you.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.445
You're welcome.

25:33.407 --> 25:36.910
Hey, so, can this
not be a one-night stand?

25:36.994 --> 25:39.704
For one thing, I didn't even get any.
That was a joke.

25:40.748 --> 25:41.915
What did you have in mind?

25:42.541 --> 25:44.959
Come to the first round of
this Battle of the Bands thing.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.252
You have a band?

25:46.337 --> 25:47.629
Yeah, we're terrible.
Please, come?

25:48.130 --> 25:49.589
Sure.

25:50.090 --> 25:52.800
Oh! Wait. Can I get
your number?

25:54.428 --> 25:56.429
Wow. Girl number.

25:57.181 --> 25:58.973
See you at the show,
Scott Pilgrim.

25:59.475 --> 26:00.934
Hey, it's tonight.
At the...

26:06.065 --> 26:08.650
Hey.
You totally came.

26:09.109 --> 26:11.778
Yes.
I did totally come.

26:17.034 --> 26:19.577
Please excuse my brother.
He is chronically enfeebled.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.079
I'm Stacey.
Hey.

26:21.163 --> 26:22.747
This is Wallace,
his roommate. Hey.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.082
This is my boyfriend, Jimmy.

26:24.166 --> 26:25.166
Hey.

26:25.793 --> 26:27.252
Oh, and this is Knives.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.087
Hey!
Hey!

26:33.801 --> 26:35.385
So, do you like?

26:35.469 --> 26:37.470
Well, I...

26:47.940 --> 26:50.525
Have to go.

26:52.987 --> 26:56.072
Okay, this next band is from Brampton,

26:56.156 --> 26:59.742
and they are Crash and the Boys.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.870
God!
This is a nightmare.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.207
Is this a nightmare?
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

27:06.292 --> 27:07.667
Once we're on stage,
you'll be fine.

27:07.751 --> 27:11.170
We were just on stage for sound check,
and the sound guy hated us.

27:11.255 --> 27:14.465
It's just nerves.
Pre-show jitters.

27:14.550 --> 27:15.717
People love us, right?

27:15.801 --> 27:17.051
Oh, man,
this is bad.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.637
This is so, so bad.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.932
Hey, Jimmy,
do they rock or suck?

27:23.934 --> 27:26.519
They have not started playing yet.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.147
That was a test, Jimmy.
- One, two.

27:29.398 --> 27:30.773
You passed.

27:30.899 --> 27:32.275
Okay.

27:32.359 --> 27:33.609
Good evening.

27:33.694 --> 27:35.987
My name is Crash.
These are the Boys.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.780
Is that girl a boy, too?

27:37.865 --> 27:38.865
Yes.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.118
They have a girl drummer?

27:42.202 --> 27:46.748
This song is called I Am So Sad,
I Am So Very Very Sad.

27:46.832 --> 27:48.207
Goes a little something like this.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.546
So sad!

27:54.840 --> 27:55.882
Thank you.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.343
It's not a race, guys.

27:58.427 --> 27:59.927
All right, this next song
goes out to the guy

28:00.012 --> 28:01.512
who keeps yelling from the balcony.

28:01.638 --> 28:03.681
It's called
We Hate You, Please Die.

28:03.766 --> 28:05.641
Sweet.
Love this one.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.071
I can feel ya,
I can hear ya...

28:33.921 --> 28:35.046
Thank you.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.925
So, how do you know Scott?

28:39.927 --> 28:41.552
He's a friend.

28:42.513 --> 28:44.097
It's hard for me to
keep track sometimes,

28:44.181 --> 28:46.307
because he has so many friends.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.020
Knives, how did you meet Scott?

28:51.105 --> 28:52.313
Well...

28:53.107 --> 28:54.273
Oh, no.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.778
This is a nightmare.

29:01.365 --> 29:02.740
We need to play now and loud.

29:02.825 --> 29:03.866
Okay.

29:03.951 --> 29:07.328
So, I was on the bus with my mom...

29:09.289 --> 29:11.290
Is that seriously the end of the story?

29:11.667 --> 29:12.792
Oh, my gosh!

29:12.876 --> 29:13.876
Okay.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.044
They're on!

29:15.129 --> 29:17.004
This next band is from Toronto.

29:17.089 --> 29:22.635
And, yeah.
Give it up for Sex Bob-Omb.

29:22.719 --> 29:24.554
I heart you,
Sex Bob-Omb!

29:27.266 --> 29:28.516
Scott, are you ready?

29:28.600 --> 29:30.059
Okay. Kim?
Are you...

29:30.144 --> 29:33.813
We are Sex Bob-Omb!
One, two, three, four!

29:41.697 --> 29:44.657
I'll take you for a ride

29:45.451 --> 29:47.827
On my garbage truck

29:49.997 --> 29:51.497
Oh, no

29:52.499 --> 29:54.834
I'll take you to the dump

29:56.712 --> 29:59.422
'Cause you're my queen

30:00.340 --> 30:02.842
I'll take you uptown

30:04.011 --> 30:07.972
I'll show you the sites
You know you wanna ride

30:09.183 --> 30:10.933
On my garbage truck

30:12.644 --> 30:14.145
Truck, truck, truck

30:14.688 --> 30:17.607
We'll pass the mansions by

30:17.691 --> 30:21.110
Drive right through the needle's eye

30:21.195 --> 30:22.278
Oh, my

30:22.362 --> 30:23.446
Oh, no... My...

30:23.572 --> 30:25.656
My, my, my, my

30:28.869 --> 30:30.870
I've got a stereo

30:32.039 --> 30:34.999
You've just got to turn the knob

30:35.083 --> 30:38.336
And maybe we'll go

30:38.420 --> 30:40.630
As far as we can

30:41.465 --> 30:43.716
I'll be your garbage man

30:45.219 --> 30:47.553
I'll take out your junk

30:48.764 --> 30:50.139
And I'll crush it...

30:52.059 --> 30:53.726
Mr. Pilgrim.

30:55.103 --> 30:58.898
It is I,
Matthew Patel.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.610
Consider our fight begun.

31:04.071 --> 31:05.488
What did I do?

31:06.782 --> 31:08.824
What do I do?

31:10.577 --> 31:11.786
Fight!

31:24.383 --> 31:29.303
All right.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.931
Watch out!
It's that one guy.

32:04.673 --> 32:06.299
Well, well, well,

32:07.384 --> 32:10.386
you're quite the opponent, Pilgrim.

32:10.470 --> 32:11.887
Who the hell are you, anyway?

32:11.972 --> 32:14.974
My name is Matthew Patel!

32:15.350 --> 32:20.771
And I'm Ramona's first
evil ex-boyfriend.

32:22.691 --> 32:23.691
Her what?

32:25.277 --> 32:26.736
Anyone need another drink?

32:38.206 --> 32:40.249
Wait. We're fighting
over Ramona?

32:41.084 --> 32:43.669
Didn't you get my e-mail
explaining the situation?

32:44.087 --> 32:45.129
I skimmed it.

32:45.422 --> 32:46.422
Mmm-mmm.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.966
You will pay for your insolence!

33:13.450 --> 33:15.743
Hey, what's up with his outfit?

33:16.286 --> 33:18.621
Yeah, is he a pirate?

33:19.414 --> 33:20.539
Are you a pirate?

33:20.624 --> 33:22.041
Pirates are in this year.

33:31.385 --> 33:32.927
You really went out with this guy?

33:34.554 --> 33:35.846
Yeah.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.933
In the seventh grade.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.143
And?

33:44.439 --> 33:47.316
It was football season
and for some reason,

33:47.401 --> 33:49.068
all the little jocks wanted me.

33:50.654 --> 33:53.823
Matthew was the only non-white,
non-jock boy in town.

33:53.907 --> 33:57.535
So, the two of us joined forces
and we took 'em all down.

33:57.619 --> 34:01.205
We brawled and scrapped
and fought for hours.

34:01.289 --> 34:03.457
Nothing could beat
Matthew's mystical powers.

34:04.751 --> 34:06.210
We only kissed once.

34:06.294 --> 34:09.463
After a week and a half,
I told him to hit the showers.

34:09.797 --> 34:12.132
Dude, wait.
Mystical powers?

34:14.594 --> 34:18.097
You'll pay for this, Flowers.

34:18.931 --> 34:21.851
If you want to fight me

34:21.935 --> 34:22.976
What?

34:23.103 --> 34:25.730
Ha!
You're not the brightest

34:26.398 --> 34:31.068
You won't know what hit
you in the slightest

34:36.283 --> 34:37.366
This guy's good.

34:37.451 --> 34:39.784
Me and my fireballs

34:40.786 --> 34:42.621
My Demon Hipster Chicks

34:42.914 --> 34:44.206
Tell him, Matty.
Tell him, Matty.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.417
I'm talking the talk

34:46.501 --> 34:49.545
Because I know I'm slick

34:49.629 --> 34:50.880
S-L-ick

34:51.882 --> 34:53.257
Fireballs

34:53.717 --> 34:55.676
Take this sucker down

34:58.722 --> 35:04.018
Let us show him what we're all about

35:04.352 --> 35:06.270
That doesn't even rhyme.

35:09.483 --> 35:12.651
This is impossible.
How can this be?

35:12.736 --> 35:15.946
Open your eyes,
maybe you'll see.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.909
K-O!

35:28.084 --> 35:29.710
Sweet! Coins.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.587
God, is that allowed?

35:32.672 --> 35:35.299
Well, it was nice meeting you.

35:35.383 --> 35:37.843
Tell your gay friends I said bye.

35:37.928 --> 35:39.386
Gay friends?

35:40.639 --> 35:41.806
Wallace! Again?

35:42.307 --> 35:44.141
- Get a room, guys!
- Oh, my God!

35:44.935 --> 35:48.521
Oh, man, $2.40?
That's not even enough for the bus home.

35:48.605 --> 35:50.773
I'll lend you the 35 cents.

35:50.857 --> 35:54.443
Yeah, so,
Sex Bob-Omb wins.

35:56.363 --> 35:58.239
Sex Bob-Omb won?

36:05.413 --> 36:08.874
So, what was all that all about?

36:11.044 --> 36:13.045
I guess

36:14.297 --> 36:17.299
if we're gonna date, you may have
to defeat my seven evil exes.

36:17.384 --> 36:18.634
You have seven evil ex-boyfriends?

36:18.718 --> 36:19.885
Seven evil exes, yes.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.512
And I have to fight... Defeat.

36:21.596 --> 36:26.141
Defeat your seven evil exes if
we're going to continue to date?

36:26.226 --> 36:27.268
Pretty much.

36:27.352 --> 36:32.064
So, what you're saying
right now is we are dating?

36:34.401 --> 36:35.401
I guess.

36:35.485 --> 36:36.610
Does that mean we can make out?

36:37.946 --> 36:38.946
Sure.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.155
Cool.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.084
Someone's happy.

36:52.168 --> 36:54.503
Well, someone got to
second base last night.

36:54.588 --> 36:57.840
And someone has a second date tonight.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.550
Someone's lucky, then.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.761
You know when I say "someone,"
I mean "me," right?

37:02.846 --> 37:04.221
I got to second base last night.

37:05.640 --> 37:06.640
Maybe first-and-a-half.

37:09.311 --> 37:13.856
So, I invited Ramona over for dinner
tonight, so you can't be here.

37:13.940 --> 37:15.482
I don't want you gaying up the place.

37:17.444 --> 37:19.153
Okay, Scott.

37:19.779 --> 37:21.906
But in return,
I have to issue an ultimatum.

37:22.198 --> 37:23.616
One of your famous ultimatums?

37:23.700 --> 37:25.576
It may live in infamy.

37:26.578 --> 37:30.623
You have to break up with Knives,
that poor angel, today.

37:32.626 --> 37:34.877
But it's hard.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.379
If you don't,
I'm going to tell Ramona about Knives.

37:37.464 --> 37:38.505
I swear to God, Scott.

37:38.590 --> 37:39.632
What? You...

37:40.467 --> 37:41.467
Hi. Morning.

37:41.551 --> 37:43.218
Hey, Jimmy.
Double standard!

37:43.303 --> 37:44.720
I didn't make up the gay rulebook.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.180
You got a problem with it... Stop.

37:46.306 --> 37:47.723
Take it up with Liberace's ghost.

37:47.807 --> 37:48.891
You're a monster.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.643
Give me the bacon,
and go do your dirt

37:50.727 --> 37:51.936
while I watch the Lucas Lee marathon.

37:52.145 --> 37:53.103
Who's Lucas Lee?

37:53.188 --> 37:54.188
Oh!

37:55.065 --> 37:56.523
He was this pretty good skater.

37:56.608 --> 37:57.983
Now he's this pretty good actor.

37:58.068 --> 38:00.069
He's filming a Winifred Hailey
movie in Toronto right now.

38:00.153 --> 38:01.278
They make movies in Toronto?

38:01.404 --> 38:02.488
Yes.

38:02.572 --> 38:04.114
I'm stalking him later.

38:04.199 --> 38:05.199
So, this Lucas Lee...

38:05.283 --> 38:07.326
Lucas Lee is not important
to you right now. Get out.

38:10.330 --> 38:11.497
You suck.

38:11.581 --> 38:12.790
Out.

38:12.958 --> 38:13.999
Surprising no one.

38:14.084 --> 38:15.084
Out.

38:17.337 --> 38:20.089
Now, you listen close,
and you listen hard, bucko.

38:20.173 --> 38:22.591
The next click you'll
hear is me hanging up.

38:22.676 --> 38:26.971
The one after that is
me pulling the trigger.

38:30.642 --> 38:31.684
Hey, Knives.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.521
Hey, do you wanna,
like, talk or whatever?

38:35.605 --> 38:40.859
Are you wearing a tan jacket, like,
a spring jacket, and a hoodie?

38:41.569 --> 38:43.487
And a dorky hat?

38:43.571 --> 38:45.656
It's not dorky.
Why are you psychic?

38:45.740 --> 38:46.782
Hey!

38:46.866 --> 38:48.117
Hey. Hey.

38:49.828 --> 38:50.953
Hey.

38:52.372 --> 38:54.248
Oh, my God.

38:54.332 --> 38:58.293
I can't believe TCAD's coming to town.
Will you take me to the show?

38:58.378 --> 39:00.671
Yeah, listen...

39:00.755 --> 39:04.216
Hey, I wanted to invite
you over for dinner.

39:04.551 --> 39:06.301
Like, Chinese food?

39:06.386 --> 39:09.138
To meet my parents.
It's my birthday dinner.

39:09.222 --> 39:11.765
I think that's a really bad idea.

39:12.225 --> 39:14.685
No, it's okay. Why?

39:14.769 --> 39:16.353
I'm too old for you.

39:16.438 --> 39:19.690
No, you're not.
My dad is nine years older than my mom.

39:19.774 --> 39:22.985
Are you even allowed to date
outside your race or whatever?

39:23.111 --> 39:26.030
I don't care. I'm...

39:27.365 --> 39:28.741
I'm in...

39:35.123 --> 39:36.415
Uh...

39:37.083 --> 39:38.459
Listen,

39:39.753 --> 39:41.462
I was thinking

39:42.797 --> 39:46.133
we should break up or whatever.

39:48.303 --> 39:49.386
Really?

39:49.763 --> 39:50.971
Yeah.

39:52.098 --> 39:54.058
It's not gonna work out.

39:56.811 --> 39:57.811
Oh.

40:27.467 --> 40:29.426
Where's Knives.
Not coming tonight?

40:29.511 --> 40:30.552
No, we broke up.

40:30.637 --> 40:33.222
Hey, check it out, I learned the
bass line from Final Fantasy II.

40:38.645 --> 40:40.562
Scott, you are the salt of the earth.

40:40.647 --> 40:41.647
Thanks.

40:42.232 --> 40:43.524
I meant scum of the earth.

40:43.942 --> 40:44.942
Thanks.

40:45.026 --> 40:46.401
You broke up with Knives?

40:46.486 --> 40:48.237
Yeah, but don't worry.

40:48.321 --> 40:50.823
Maybe soon you'll meet
my new-new girlfriend.

40:50.907 --> 40:51.949
New-new.

40:53.701 --> 40:58.413
Okay, from here on out, no girlfriends
or girlfriend talk at practice.

40:58.498 --> 41:00.165
Whether they're old, new, or

41:00.250 --> 41:01.375
New-new.
New-new.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.752
We were lucky to survive the last round.

41:03.837 --> 41:05.462
It's sudden death now, okay?

41:05.547 --> 41:06.755
Okay.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.764
That's for me.
That's for me. That's for me.

41:15.849 --> 41:18.517
Hey, you're here.

41:19.561 --> 41:21.311
Yes, like you said.

41:22.981 --> 41:23.981
You know your hair?

41:24.065 --> 41:25.107
I know of it.

41:25.191 --> 41:26.316
It's all blue.

41:26.401 --> 41:29.570
I change my hair every week and
a half, dude. Get used to it.

41:30.572 --> 41:32.030
So...

41:33.324 --> 41:34.741
How do you guys all know each other?

41:35.827 --> 41:38.036
High school,
I guess.

41:38.121 --> 41:39.413
What Neil said.

41:39.539 --> 41:40.664
I'm Neil.

41:40.748 --> 41:43.458
Believe it or not,
I actually dated Scott in high school.

41:43.710 --> 41:45.252
Got any embarrassing stories?

41:45.336 --> 41:46.962
Yeah, he's an idiot.

41:47.297 --> 41:49.006
Okay, bye.
See you guys tomorrow.

41:49.090 --> 41:50.132
What about rehearsal?

41:50.258 --> 41:51.300
Neil knows my parts.

41:53.386 --> 41:54.887
I'm Neil.

42:03.146 --> 42:04.146
You doing okay, there?

42:04.230 --> 42:05.856
Yeah, good, good, good.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.235
She changed her hair.

42:10.403 --> 42:11.570
So?
It looks nice blue.

42:11.654 --> 42:13.071
Yeah, I know,
but she did it without even making

42:13.156 --> 42:14.281
a big deal of it or anything.

42:14.365 --> 42:17.075
She's fickle.
Impulsive. Spontaneous.

42:17.285 --> 42:18.744
God, what am I gonna do?

42:19.037 --> 42:22.998
Can't believe you're worried
about me gaying up the place.

42:23.082 --> 42:25.000
So, how's dinner coming along?

42:25.084 --> 42:26.919
Yeah, good, good, good.

42:28.421 --> 42:31.506
Okay, well,
I'm gonna leave you lovebirds to it.

42:31.591 --> 42:35.177
I am heading up to Casa Loma
to stalk my hetero crush.

42:35.261 --> 42:36.303
Don't go!

42:36.387 --> 42:37.763
Will you man the hell up?

42:37.847 --> 42:39.223
You can get to second
and a half base tonight.

42:39.307 --> 42:40.432
You think so?

42:40.516 --> 42:43.435
Well, if you strike out in the next
hour, come find me at the castle.

42:43.728 --> 42:44.770
If I strike out?

42:44.854 --> 42:46.188
Okay, when.
See you in 60.

42:51.236 --> 42:52.694
This is actually really
good garlic bread.

42:52.779 --> 42:54.363
Garlic bread is my favorite food.

42:54.447 --> 42:56.156
I could honestly eat it for every meal.

42:56.449 --> 42:58.909
Or just eat it all the time
without even stopping.

42:58.993 --> 43:00.077
You'd get fat.

43:00.203 --> 43:01.286
No, why would I get fat?

43:01.371 --> 43:02.412
Bread makes you fat.

43:02.497 --> 43:03.747
Bread makes you fat?

43:06.584 --> 43:07.793
I wrote a song about you.

43:07.919 --> 43:08.961
You did?

43:09.045 --> 43:10.128
Yeah, it goes like this.

43:10.797 --> 43:13.882
Ramona

43:17.387 --> 43:20.305
Ramona

43:22.016 --> 43:24.434
On my mind

43:25.645 --> 43:29.606
Ramona

43:35.029 --> 43:36.446
Can't wait to hear it
when it's finished.

43:37.198 --> 43:38.323
Finished?

43:45.039 --> 43:46.498
Your hair's pretty shaggy.

43:46.582 --> 43:48.583
Oh, God,
I need a haircut, don't I?

43:48.668 --> 43:49.626
What?

43:49.711 --> 43:51.003
No, sorry. I just...

43:51.337 --> 43:54.840
I got a bad haircut right before
me and my big ex broke up,

43:54.924 --> 43:57.426
but that was so long ago
now I can barely remember.

43:57.510 --> 44:00.262
Scott is acutely aware that his
last salon haircut took place

44:00.346 --> 44:04.182
exactly 431 days ago,
three hours before his big breakup.

44:04.267 --> 44:06.435
He's been cutting his
own hair ever since.

44:06.519 --> 44:07.644
So long ago.

44:09.063 --> 44:10.314
Sounds like a bad time.

44:10.398 --> 44:12.232
Bad time?
Not really.

44:12.317 --> 44:13.400
It was.

44:13.484 --> 44:14.693
It was a mutual thing.

44:14.777 --> 44:15.861
It wasn't.

44:15.945 --> 44:18.905
I mean,
she told me it was mutual.

44:18.990 --> 44:21.366
She dumped him.
It was brutal.

44:21.451 --> 44:22.659
What was her name?

44:22.744 --> 44:24.036
She was Nat,
when I knew her,

44:24.120 --> 44:26.204
but she stopped liking that name.

44:26.289 --> 44:27.956
Then she stopped liking me.

44:28.041 --> 44:29.916
Your hair is cute.
I like it long.

44:30.001 --> 44:31.793
But it would be cuter short,
wouldn't it?

44:31.878 --> 44:33.712
What?
What?

44:34.422 --> 44:35.464
Why are you wearing that hat?

44:35.548 --> 44:36.757
I thought we could go for a walk.

44:38.509 --> 44:39.926
Tell me we didn't come
out here in the cold

44:40.011 --> 44:41.303
so you could cover your
hair with that hat.

44:41.387 --> 44:43.972
No, no. I just love me
some walking, you know.

44:44.057 --> 44:49.061
Just putting one leg in front of
the other, like this. Walking.

44:49.145 --> 44:51.104
You seem a little heightened.

44:51.898 --> 44:53.231
Yeah.
Yeah, I don't know.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.901
I just sort of feel like I'm
on drugs when I'm with you.

44:55.985 --> 44:57.486
Not that I do drugs,
unless you do drugs,

44:57.570 --> 44:59.488
in which case I do drugs all the time.

44:59.572 --> 45:00.572
Every drug.

45:01.366 --> 45:04.326
Yeah, I don't know.
Just when I'm with you,

45:04.410 --> 45:07.120
things sort of seem a little brighter.

45:07.205 --> 45:08.205
What is this place?

45:08.289 --> 45:09.831
It's a totally awesome castle.

45:09.957 --> 45:11.500
They're shooting this
movie here right now.

45:11.584 --> 45:14.211
Okay, everybody, let's do this.
Lots to do, everyone.

45:14.295 --> 45:15.295
Lots to do.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.130
Did you find the guy you were stalking?

45:17.215 --> 45:18.840
I think I'm about to right now.

45:18.925 --> 45:20.509
Mr. Lee is traveling.

45:20.593 --> 45:21.635
Mr. Lee?

45:21.719 --> 45:23.053
Lucas Lee.

45:23.137 --> 45:24.137
Oh.

45:24.639 --> 45:25.639
Oh?

45:25.723 --> 45:27.349
And roll sound.

45:34.107 --> 45:36.441
I wanna have his adopted babies.

45:37.652 --> 45:38.777
Here we go.

45:40.571 --> 45:42.280
All right,
on your marks, everyone.

45:42.365 --> 45:43.698
Oh, man,
we got to go.

45:43.950 --> 45:45.033
What? Why?

45:45.118 --> 45:47.411
I used to date that clown.

45:47.495 --> 45:48.537
And...

45:48.621 --> 45:49.663
Action.

45:49.997 --> 45:51.581
Oh, my God.

45:51.666 --> 45:52.833
Hey.

45:53.584 --> 45:55.252
The only thing keeping me and her apart

45:55.336 --> 45:57.629
is the two minutes it's
gonna take to kick your ass.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.381
You dated a famous guy?

45:59.465 --> 46:01.174
In ninth grade.
We had drama.

46:01.259 --> 46:02.551
Actually, it might have been math.

46:02.677 --> 46:04.010
I just remember there
being a lot of drama.

46:04.095 --> 46:05.053
Hey!

46:05.138 --> 46:07.055
He was a snot-nosed little brat.
He just followed me around.

46:07.140 --> 46:09.891
He had snot in his nose?
But he's famous.

46:09.976 --> 46:12.477
Hey! I'm talking to you,
Scott Pilgrim.

46:12.562 --> 46:14.146
He's famous and he talked to me.

46:14.397 --> 46:16.356
The only thing keeping me and her apart

46:16.441 --> 46:18.984
is the two minutes it's
gonna take to kick your ass.

46:19.193 --> 46:21.778
Can I have your...
Can I have your autograph, please?

46:25.199 --> 46:26.241
What's up?

46:26.325 --> 46:28.535
How's life?
He seems nice.

46:32.039 --> 46:33.373
Boom!

46:36.961 --> 46:38.962
And that's a cut!

46:39.839 --> 46:43.383
Scott, evil ex.
Fight.

46:43.468 --> 46:46.094
Let's get ready to go again, please.
Let's get ready to go again.

46:46.179 --> 46:47.804
Hey, hombre.

46:48.848 --> 46:51.808
You really think you can stand a
chance against an A-lister, bro?

46:55.480 --> 46:57.939
Some competish you are.

46:59.525 --> 47:00.525
Hey!

47:01.486 --> 47:02.652
Hey!

47:03.779 --> 47:05.697
Hey, I'm not done with you.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.203
Looks like you're seeing double.

47:13.206 --> 47:14.206
He's good, right?

47:14.540 --> 47:16.249
Sometimes I let him do the wide shots

47:16.626 --> 47:19.920
when I feel like getting
blazed back in my Winnie.

47:25.009 --> 47:26.259
What can I say?

47:27.887 --> 47:29.888
I'm nothing without my stunt team.

47:35.728 --> 47:38.688
Hey! Ask them how it feels to
always get his sloppy seconds.

47:38.773 --> 47:39.773
How does it...

48:14.141 --> 48:16.142
Hey, I'm gonna get a coffee.
You homies want anything?

48:16.269 --> 48:18.103
No, I just ate.
Negative.

48:25.278 --> 48:27.445
That's actually hilarious.

48:28.072 --> 48:29.114
Ah.

48:29.198 --> 48:30.615
Hilarious.

48:31.867 --> 48:33.451
Mr. Lee!

48:38.207 --> 48:40.125
You're needed back on set.

49:07.653 --> 49:09.154
Prepare...

49:09.989 --> 49:13.992
Prepare to feel the wrath
of the League of Evil Exes.

49:14.201 --> 49:15.827
The League of Evil Axes?

49:16.412 --> 49:17.704
You really don't know about the League?

49:19.123 --> 49:22.167
The seven evil exes?
Coming to kill you?

49:22.668 --> 49:25.545
Controlling the future
of Ramona's love life?

49:25.630 --> 49:26.755
No.

49:26.839 --> 49:28.506
Oh, well, hey, listen, man.
Don't worry about it.

49:28.924 --> 49:30.467
Really? Yeah.
Let's go get a beer.

49:30.551 --> 49:31.551
That's great...

49:31.636 --> 49:32.969
Boom!

49:36.557 --> 49:38.266
You are a pretty good actor.

49:38.351 --> 49:39.684
I'm going for the Oscar this year.

49:40.936 --> 49:42.896
But are you a pretty good skater?

49:42.980 --> 49:45.148
I'm more than pretty good, ese.

49:45.358 --> 49:47.233
I have my own skate company.

49:47.818 --> 49:51.780
But can you do a thingy on that rail?

49:54.283 --> 49:56.034
It's called a grind, bro.

49:56.118 --> 49:59.954
So, can you do a grindy thingy now?

50:01.582 --> 50:03.375
Are you serious?

50:05.628 --> 50:08.213
There are, like, 200 steps,
and the rails are garbage.

50:08.297 --> 50:10.423
Well, hey,
if it's too hardcore then...

50:11.050 --> 50:14.469
You really think you can goad
me into doing a trick like that?

50:14.553 --> 50:16.012
There are girls watching.

50:18.683 --> 50:21.017
Somebody get me my board.

50:22.269 --> 50:24.396
Hi. Big fan.

50:25.981 --> 50:27.607
Why wouldn't you be?

50:42.665 --> 50:58.054
Wow.

50:58.347 --> 50:59.848
Yes!
He totally bailed.

51:01.100 --> 51:02.434
Ah! I didn't get
his autograph.

51:02.518 --> 51:03.560
No.

51:03.644 --> 51:05.895
And that's a wrap, everybody.

51:05.980 --> 51:08.857
Hey, where's Ramona.
Is she still here?

51:08.941 --> 51:11.192
No.
She totally bailed.

51:11.277 --> 51:13.820
What's the deal?
Seriously.

51:13.904 --> 51:15.822
Let's move, people,
the sun is coming up.

51:17.575 --> 51:22.036
Hey, it's me again. Scott.
Give me a call when you get this.

51:22.121 --> 51:23.872
Scott Pilgrim.

51:24.957 --> 51:27.375
What's the deal?
Seriously.

51:27.460 --> 51:29.711
Yep. You said that
last night.

51:29.795 --> 51:31.004
You know what really sucks, though?

51:31.505 --> 51:32.505
What?

51:33.299 --> 51:34.591
Everything.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.301
Come on, guy.

51:36.802 --> 51:38.678
You can't say you
didn't see this coming.

51:38.763 --> 51:39.804
What?

51:41.849 --> 51:43.266
What did you think these were?

51:43.851 --> 51:46.811
Kisses?
Seven little kisses?

51:46.896 --> 51:49.981
Seven deadly X's.

51:53.152 --> 51:55.904
Why does everything have
to be so complicated?

51:56.989 --> 51:59.199
If you want something bad,
you have to fight for it.

51:59.617 --> 52:00.992
Step up your game, Scott.

52:01.202 --> 52:02.535
Break out the L-word.

52:02.620 --> 52:03.828
"Lesbian?"

52:04.121 --> 52:05.288
The other L-word.

52:06.207 --> 52:07.582
"Lesbians?"

52:07.666 --> 52:10.293
It's "love," Scott.
I wasn't trying to trick you.

52:10.377 --> 52:12.629
Hey, buddy, look,

52:12.963 --> 52:15.965
if she really is the
girl of your dreams,

52:16.050 --> 52:17.509
then you have to let her know.

52:17.593 --> 52:21.262
You have to overcome any and all
obstacles that lie in your path.

52:21.555 --> 52:24.432
You can do it. Be with her!
It's your destiny!

52:25.518 --> 52:27.435
Plus, I need you to move out.

52:27.520 --> 52:28.603
What?
Yeah.

52:28.687 --> 52:30.021
I'm kind of banking on
her calling you back

52:30.105 --> 52:32.440
so I don't have to evict you
and feel all guilty and shit.

52:33.609 --> 52:34.943
I have a feeling that's for you, guy.

52:36.570 --> 52:37.570
Hey.

52:37.696 --> 52:38.696
Hey, Scott.

52:38.781 --> 52:40.573
Envy?
Oh, shit.

52:41.283 --> 52:42.408
Been a while.

52:42.493 --> 52:43.451
Yeah.

52:43.536 --> 52:44.744
A year, I think.

52:44.829 --> 52:46.162
Approximately.

52:46.372 --> 52:47.455
How are you?

52:47.540 --> 52:48.957
I'm not doing so good right now.

52:49.375 --> 52:53.461
Oh, that's too bad.
Still breaking hearts?

52:53.546 --> 52:57.549
What? No. I've been...
It's been different. You have no idea.

52:57.633 --> 53:00.176
Probably not.
Do you have a girlfriend?

53:00.261 --> 53:02.303
Should I be jealous?

53:02.388 --> 53:04.639
Yes, you should.
I have this totally awesome girlfriend

53:04.723 --> 53:07.267
who calls me all the
time and she's America.

53:07.351 --> 53:08.351
She's American.

53:08.435 --> 53:09.602
What's her name?

53:09.687 --> 53:11.396
I'm not telling you that.
Ramona.

53:11.480 --> 53:12.480
Oh.

53:12.815 --> 53:13.815
What?
Do you know her?

53:13.899 --> 53:15.316
What? No.

53:15.776 --> 53:17.193
It sounded like you did.

53:17.278 --> 53:19.821
I got to go.
It's been nice chatting with you.

53:19.905 --> 53:21.072
Wait.

53:26.871 --> 53:28.079
Okay.

53:30.499 --> 53:31.624
Everything does suck.

53:31.792 --> 53:34.419
Or does it? Hello?

53:35.254 --> 53:36.379
Hey, Knives.

53:37.756 --> 53:40.008
What's that?
You're outside?

53:41.093 --> 53:42.552
Is Scott here?

53:42.636 --> 53:45.263
You know what?
He just left.

53:47.224 --> 53:48.224
Really?

53:48.350 --> 53:49.392
Yeah.

53:51.520 --> 53:52.687
Sorry.

53:55.774 --> 53:57.025
Do you have a girlfriend?

53:57.109 --> 54:00.153
Seven deadly X's.

54:00.446 --> 54:02.864
You may have to defeat
my seven evil exes.

54:04.033 --> 54:06.159
It's sudden death now, okay?

54:06.285 --> 54:08.494
She's got some battle scars, dude.

54:08.579 --> 54:10.455
You can't say you
didn't see this coming.

54:13.459 --> 54:14.667
Dude.

54:17.796 --> 54:18.796
Please.

54:19.798 --> 54:21.424
I'm really not in the mood for this.

54:23.802 --> 54:25.053
Okay, enough!

54:31.936 --> 54:33.353
You punched me in the boob!

54:34.939 --> 54:37.023
Prepare to die, obviously.

54:37.107 --> 54:39.359
Look, I've had it today.
Can we not do this right now?

54:39.443 --> 54:41.527
I'd love to postpone, darling,

54:41.612 --> 54:43.905
but I just cashed my last rain check.

54:44.239 --> 54:45.615
What's that from?
My brain!

54:46.492 --> 54:49.202
I'm really, really not up for this.
Whatever it is.

54:49.286 --> 54:52.747
Okay, little chicken.
I'll see you later.

54:52.831 --> 54:54.499
But you won't see me,

54:54.583 --> 54:58.211
because next time,
I'll be deadly serious next time.

54:58.545 --> 54:59.545
What?

54:59.630 --> 55:00.755
Never mind!

55:02.341 --> 55:04.509
Man.
Someone help me.

55:05.761 --> 55:07.095
Hello.
It's Scott.

55:07.179 --> 55:08.346
What did he do this time?

55:08.430 --> 55:09.973
No, it's Scott.
It's actually me.

55:10.057 --> 55:11.099
What did you do this time?

55:11.183 --> 55:12.850
I didn't do anything.
It's everyone else that's crazy.

55:12.935 --> 55:14.936
Look, I'm having a meltdown or whatever.
Are you still working?

55:15.020 --> 55:16.145
I'm literally about to leave.

55:16.230 --> 55:17.397
Cool, I'm coming in.

55:23.862 --> 55:25.363
I think I'll make it a decaf today.

55:25.447 --> 55:26.698
Scott Pilgrim!

55:27.199 --> 55:28.533
What did you do with my sister?

55:29.702 --> 55:31.536
Sorry, I had to go.

55:32.079 --> 55:33.871
So, what can I get you?

55:33.956 --> 55:35.206
Is there anywhere you don't work?

55:35.290 --> 55:38.418
They're called jobs. Something a like
you wouldn't know anything about.

55:38.502 --> 55:40.712
And by the way, I can't
believe you asked Ramona out

55:40.796 --> 55:43.339
after I specifically
told you not to do that.

55:43.424 --> 55:44.799
How are you doing that with your mouth?

55:44.883 --> 55:46.926
Never mind how I'm doing it!

55:47.011 --> 55:48.386
What do you have to say for yourself?

55:48.721 --> 55:50.179
Can I get a caramel macchiato?

55:51.181 --> 55:53.725
You know what, maybe it's high
time you took a look in a mirror

55:53.809 --> 55:55.476
before you wreak havoc on another girl.

55:55.561 --> 55:56.686
Me? Wreak havoc?

55:56.770 --> 55:57.979
And speaking of which,

55:58.063 --> 55:59.188
I hear the girl that kicked
your heart in the ass

55:59.273 --> 56:00.898
is walking the streets of Toronto again.

56:02.234 --> 56:03.818
So, I can just get my coffee over here?

56:07.072 --> 56:08.489
Sorry that got a little
crazy last night.

56:08.907 --> 56:10.825
Yeah, you kind of disappeared.

56:11.577 --> 56:13.745
Yeah, I do that.

56:15.289 --> 56:18.833
Listen, I know I can be
hard to be around sometimes.

56:19.334 --> 56:21.502
I totally understand if you
don't want to hang out anymore.

56:21.587 --> 56:23.629
No, no,
I want to hang.

56:24.048 --> 56:25.840
You know, the whole
evil ex-boyfriend thing...

56:25.924 --> 56:26.924
Exes.

56:27.009 --> 56:28.009
It's no biggie.

56:28.635 --> 56:31.179
I know it's early,

56:31.263 --> 56:33.723
but I don't think anything
can get in the way of how I...

56:33.807 --> 56:34.932
Shit!

56:36.268 --> 56:37.393
It's my ex.

56:37.478 --> 56:38.728
A big one?
Mmm-hmm.

56:39.521 --> 56:40.855
Envy.

56:43.609 --> 56:44.776
I'm gonna...

56:46.070 --> 56:47.445
Excuse me.

56:49.948 --> 56:51.032
Your hair is getting shaggy.

56:51.116 --> 56:52.116
Yeah?

56:52.201 --> 56:53.743
So, that's Ramona.

56:53.827 --> 56:54.869
Yeah.

56:55.120 --> 56:56.537
Okay, I'm jealous.

56:56.622 --> 56:57.663
You're jealous?

56:57.915 --> 56:58.956
I'm allowed.

56:59.166 --> 57:01.375
You left me for that cocky pretty boy.

57:01.460 --> 57:03.127
You haven't even seen him.

57:03.337 --> 57:05.546
I know, you left me for
someone I've never even seen.

57:05.631 --> 57:08.424
Maybe you will see him.
We're playing Lee's Palace.

57:08.509 --> 57:11.344
You should so totally come.

57:11.428 --> 57:13.930
That's so not going to happen.

57:14.014 --> 57:15.932
Great, you're so on the list.

57:17.851 --> 57:21.229
Caramel macchiato for Pilgrim.

57:21.939 --> 57:23.356
So, that was Envy.

57:24.608 --> 57:26.067
What happened with the two of you?

57:26.151 --> 57:28.069
Do you mind if we don't
get into it right now?

57:28.153 --> 57:29.654
She wanted to move to Montreal,

57:29.738 --> 57:31.155
because she missed her best friend.

57:31.615 --> 57:33.032
This guy, Todd.

57:33.117 --> 57:35.076
And two weeks later,
they were sleeping together, I guess?

57:35.160 --> 57:36.744
Basically.

57:36.829 --> 57:39.997
Dated a Todd once.
Didn't end well, either.

57:40.082 --> 57:43.835
I can see how it sucks.
Having the past come back to haunt you.

57:44.169 --> 57:46.587
Is it wrong that I try
not to think about it?

57:46.672 --> 57:48.214
What do you want to think about?

57:48.507 --> 57:50.591
How warm my place is right now.

57:50.676 --> 57:51.676
Oh.

57:53.095 --> 57:55.847
And you didn't bang her?
Are you gay?

57:56.181 --> 57:58.683
I couldn't stop thinking
about my stupid ex-girlfriend.

57:58.767 --> 58:00.226
Is that the Uma Thurman movie?

58:00.310 --> 58:04.605
Scott, just because Envy is back
in town doesn't make it not over.

58:04.690 --> 58:06.774
Double negative.
It's tricky.

58:06.859 --> 58:08.734
It's over. Move on.

58:08.819 --> 58:09.777
Word.

58:09.862 --> 58:12.572
Right. I'm not going
to let her toy with me.

58:12.865 --> 58:14.949
From this moment on,

58:15.033 --> 58:17.785
I will think of Envy Adams no more!

58:19.204 --> 58:20.371
I have distressing news.

58:20.455 --> 58:23.416
Is it news that we suck, because I
really don't think I can take it.

58:23.500 --> 58:26.502
No. The Clash at Demonhead are
doing a secret show tomorrow night

58:26.587 --> 58:28.671
and Envy asked us to open for them.

58:28.755 --> 58:29.797
I hate you.

58:29.882 --> 58:32.049
A gig is a gig,
is a gig, is a gig.

58:32.134 --> 58:33.509
Maybe you can put your history aside

58:33.594 --> 58:35.428
until we get through
this thing, for the band.

58:35.762 --> 58:37.471
For the band?
For the band?

58:37.556 --> 58:38.931
Can't we do our...
For the band?

58:39.016 --> 58:40.141
Can't we do our own secret shows?

58:40.225 --> 58:41.934
All our shows are secret shows.

58:42.227 --> 58:45.146
We're doing it.
G-Man might be there.

58:45.230 --> 58:47.148
We play the next round
of the battle on Tuesday.

58:47.232 --> 58:50.568
We have to get some buzz going.
We need groundswell.

58:50.652 --> 58:52.195
We need stalkers.

58:59.494 --> 59:01.078
What would you do if
your ex was in a band

59:01.163 --> 59:02.872
and they wanted you to open for them?

59:03.081 --> 59:04.749
If my ex was in a band?

59:04.833 --> 59:05.833
Mmm-hmm.

59:06.418 --> 59:07.919
Might be a little
awkward, but maybe

59:08.003 --> 59:09.670
it's the grown-up thing to do.

59:09.963 --> 59:12.590
Yeah. We're all
adults here, right?

59:14.218 --> 59:15.885
Oh, my God!

59:15.969 --> 59:17.970
He's dating a fat-ass hipster chick!

59:18.055 --> 59:19.597
I hate her stupid guts!

59:19.932 --> 59:24.894
He only likes her because she's old.
She's probably, like, 25!

59:25.229 --> 59:27.563
She's just some fat-ass
white girl, you know?

59:27.648 --> 59:29.565
I think you mentioned she was fat.

59:29.650 --> 59:30.983
She's got a head start.

59:31.068 --> 59:34.445
I mean, I didn't even know there
was good music until two months ago!

59:34.529 --> 59:35.571
Hey, this really burns.

59:35.656 --> 59:36.697
You should rinse.

59:37.866 --> 59:40.409
When I got this idea,
I just thought, "I have to do it!"

59:40.494 --> 59:42.328
I can't hear anything you're saying.

59:43.121 --> 59:45.289
Oh, God! I look so

59:47.000 --> 59:48.626
good.

59:49.211 --> 59:51.587
Ramona Flowers stole my Scott.

59:51.922 --> 59:54.715
But I know how to get him back.

59:55.217 --> 59:56.259
How?

01:00:07.896 --> 01:00:10.022
Come on,
come on

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:16.904
Thank you,
we were Sex Bob-Omb.

01:00:16.989 --> 01:00:18.447
Yeah!

01:00:18.532 --> 01:00:20.741
We have some merch at the back, so...

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.828
Okay, bar? Now?

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:30.751
Level with me.
Did we suck?

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:32.962
I don't know.
Did you?

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:37.383
She has to go.
She knows we suck.

01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:43.014
Hey, Ramona.

01:00:45.058 --> 01:00:46.309
Hey.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.270
What the hell?

01:00:58.238 --> 01:00:59.572
Hey.

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:01.032
Hey, Scott.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:03.242
What the hell?

01:01:03.327 --> 01:01:05.077
Look who Knives is hanging out with.

01:01:05.704 --> 01:01:06.871
Who is that girl again?

01:01:06.955 --> 01:01:07.955
Scott dated her.

01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.081
Briefly, briefly.

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:10.791
How old is she?

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:16.505
I gotta pee on her.

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:19.467
I mean, I gotta pee.
Pee time.

01:01:20.969 --> 01:01:24.388
And then it was time

01:01:24.473 --> 01:01:28.142
for Toronto to drown in the sweet sorrow

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:32.897
of The Clash at Demonhead!

01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:38.569
Envy! Envy!

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:42.323
That guy on bass...

01:01:42.407 --> 01:01:43.657
Oh, yeah

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:45.034
...that's Todd.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.202
I know.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:47.787
Oh, yeah?

01:01:48.789 --> 01:01:49.997
You know?

01:01:50.082 --> 01:01:52.291
Oh, yeah!

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:54.585
Oh, no.

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:58.631
Hello, again,
friend of a friend

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.549
I knew you well

01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:04.512
Our common goal

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:09.100
was waiting for the world to end

01:02:10.352 --> 01:02:12.269
Now that the truth

01:02:12.354 --> 01:02:16.899
is just a rule that you demand

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:19.860
You crack the whip

01:02:19.945 --> 01:02:24.198
Shape-shift and trick the past again

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:28.577
Send you my love on the wire

01:02:28.662 --> 01:02:31.997
Lift you up,
every time

01:02:32.082 --> 01:02:34.750
Everyone

01:02:35.961 --> 01:02:37.837
pulls away

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:42.633
from you

01:02:43.135 --> 01:02:45.428
That was...
That was devastating.

01:02:45.512 --> 01:02:47.471
Oh, my God.
Just, oh, my God.

01:02:47.556 --> 01:02:50.558
Yeah, you should see them live.
They're much better live.

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:51.892
I think I'm gonna throw up.

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:55.813
I can't even believe I'm saying this,

01:02:55.897 --> 01:02:58.649
but Envy Adams would like
you all to come backstage.

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:00.109
All of us?

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:01.652
Did I stutter?

01:03:05.407 --> 01:03:07.408
Wait, how do you know Envy?

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:08.576
Scott dated her.

01:03:13.665 --> 01:03:14.957
Hey, Ramona.

01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.042
Hey, Todd.

01:03:17.502 --> 01:03:19.086
It's been awhile.

01:03:19.546 --> 01:03:20.546
Mmm-hmm.

01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:22.047
Mmm-hmm?

01:03:22.883 --> 01:03:24.175
I think we should get out of here.

01:03:24.259 --> 01:03:26.218
So, how was the tour?
You guys play with the Pixies?

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:27.803
You're like a superstar now.

01:03:27.888 --> 01:03:30.598
Yeah, it's not really
something I can put into words.

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:31.682
Um, Envy...

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:34.393
I read your blog.

01:03:34.769 --> 01:03:37.771
So, Scott and Ramona, eh?

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:38.939
What of it?

01:03:39.024 --> 01:03:40.107
You guys make a cute couple,
you know?

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:42.485
Suit each other.

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:44.820
You're my role model, Envy.

01:03:44.905 --> 01:03:47.114
Ramona, I like your outfit.
Affordable?

01:03:47.199 --> 01:03:49.200
Envy, I was just gonna say did
you get those jeans in New York?

01:03:49.284 --> 01:03:51.494
I'm talking to Ramona right now.

01:03:51.953 --> 01:03:52.995
Ramona lived in New York.

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:54.163
Did she?

01:03:54.372 --> 01:03:57.625
I was just there.
Played the Chaos Theatre, for Gideon.

01:03:58.126 --> 01:03:59.210
You know him, right?

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:02.296
I've kissed the lips that kissed you!

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:08.344
Knives!

01:04:09.221 --> 01:04:10.304
What?

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:11.555
I'm not afraid to hit a girl.

01:04:13.475 --> 01:04:15.017
I'm a rock star.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:16.268
Oh, my God!

01:04:17.312 --> 01:04:19.647
You punched the highlights
out of her hair.

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:23.901
He punched the highlights
out of her hair!

01:04:24.152 --> 01:04:26.028
You are incorrigible.

01:04:26.238 --> 01:04:28.197
I don't know the meaning of the word.

01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:34.912
So, you guys doing anything
fun while you're in town?

01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:37.831
Fun? In Toronto?

01:04:38.458 --> 01:04:41.168
That's it!
You cocky cock!

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:43.879
You'll pay for your
crimes against humanity.

01:04:55.767 --> 01:04:57.434
My neck.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:04:59.812
Your hair.

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:02.273
Didn't you know?

01:05:02.482 --> 01:05:03.732
Todd's vegan.

01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:10.489
Vegan?

01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:13.867
It's not really that big of a deal.

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:16.912
No kidding.

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:20.416
Anyone can be vegan.

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:23.335
Ovo-lacto vegetarian maybe.

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:24.628
Ovo-what?

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:29.466
I partake not in the meat,
nor the breast milk, nor the ovum

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:31.635
of any creature with a face.

01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:32.886
Short answer,

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:35.472
being vegan just makes you
better than most people.

01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:36.640
Bingo.

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:41.562
Hey, man, question.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.398
I always wondered,
how does not eating dairy products

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:46.317
give you psychic powers?

01:05:46.401 --> 01:05:47.901
Okay.

01:05:47.986 --> 01:05:50.362
You know how you only
use 10% of your brain?

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.740
That's because the other 90%
is filled with curds and whey.

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:54.908
Did you learn that at Vegan Academy?

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:56.410
Go ahead and get snippy, baby.

01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:58.954
If you knew the science, maybe I'd
listen to a word you're saying.

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:06.545
If I peed my pants, would you
pretend I just got wet from the rain?

01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:07.671
It's not raining.

01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:08.756
Oh.

01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:10.633
Then why don't you
give me the Cliff Notes

01:06:10.717 --> 01:06:13.344
on how and why you ended
up dating this A-hole.

01:06:13.428 --> 01:06:14.762
Is that really important right now?

01:06:14.846 --> 01:06:16.764
Well, if there's a key
element in his backstory

01:06:16.848 --> 01:06:20.142
that's gonna help me out in a
critical moment of not dying, yes.

01:06:21.978 --> 01:06:25.230
I was only dating Lucas until
the minute Todd walked by.

01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:29.526
Guess that's not very nice,
but I used to be, kind of like that.

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:33.614
We hated everyone.
We wrecked stuff. Nobody cared.

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:35.866
He punched a hole in the moon for me.

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.785
It was pretty crazy.

01:06:37.869 --> 01:06:39.078
A week and a half later he told me

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:40.954
his dad was sending
him to Vegan Academy,

01:06:41.706 --> 01:06:43.040
so I dumped him.

01:06:43.667 --> 01:06:45.918
Have you dumped everyone
you've ever been with?

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:47.836
You've never been the dumpee?

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:51.048
Look, I've dabbled in being a bitch.

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:52.925
It's part of the reason I moved here.

01:06:53.009 --> 01:06:56.303
I was really hoping to just
leave it all behind me.

01:06:56.388 --> 01:06:57.763
Hey, lovebirds...

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:01.058
We have unfinished business,
I and he.

01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:02.976
He and me.

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:04.520
Don't you talk to me about grammar.

01:07:04.604 --> 01:07:06.480
I dislike you, capisce?

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:08.315
Tell it to the cleaning lady on Monday.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.483
What?

01:07:09.567 --> 01:07:11.068
Because you'll be dust by Monday.

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:12.778
Um...

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.905
Because you'll be
pulverized in two seconds.

01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:18.242
And the cleaning lady,
she cleans up dust.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.411
She dusts.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:23.997
So, what's on Monday?

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:29.169
Because it's Friday now.
She has the weekends off, so...

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:31.714
Monday. Right?

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:33.716
Basically, you can't win this fight.

01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:34.967
You're gonna have to give up this girl,

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:36.385
because Todd's gonna kill you.

01:07:37.262 --> 01:07:38.679
You used to be so nice!

01:07:50.942 --> 01:07:53.944
Scott, we're gonna go to
Pizza Pizza for a slice.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:55.446
Call us when you're done.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:58.115
He'll be done.
Real soon.

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:04.788
Sounds like someone wants to get funky.

01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:32.042
I can read your thoughts.
Your will is broken. You're through.

01:09:32.544 --> 01:09:34.377
What say we drink to my memory?

01:09:34.546 --> 01:09:36.421
Fair trade blend with soy milk?

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.924
I'm sorry,
but that's pathetic.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:41.009
Dude, I can see in your mind's eye.

01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:43.220
You put half-and-half
into one of those coffees

01:09:43.304 --> 01:09:45.514
in an attempt to make
me break vegan edge.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.390
I'll take the one with soy.

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:52.062
Thanks, tool.

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:56.650
Actually, muchacho,
I poured the soy in this cup.

01:09:56.734 --> 01:09:59.528
But I thought real hard
about pouring it in that cup.

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:02.531
You know,
in my mind's eye or whatever.

01:10:03.575 --> 01:10:05.075
What are you talking about?

01:10:05.159 --> 01:10:06.577
You just drank half-and-half, baby.

01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:09.705
Freeze!
Vegan police!

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:10.998
Vegan police!

01:10:11.082 --> 01:10:14.585
Todd Ingram, you're under
arrest for veganity violation,

01:10:14.669 --> 01:10:17.921
code number 827,
imbibement of half-and-half.

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:19.548
That's bullroar!

01:10:19.632 --> 01:10:21.550
No vegan diet,
no vegan powers!

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:23.802
But it's only my first offense.

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:25.012
Don't I get three strikes?
I mean...

01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:26.471
Take it.

01:10:27.390 --> 01:10:30.017
At 12:27 a.m. on February 1 st,

01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:31.393
you knowingly ingested gelato.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:33.353
Gelato isn't vegan?

01:10:33.438 --> 01:10:34.855
It's milk and eggs, bitch.

01:10:34.939 --> 01:10:38.066
On April 4th, 7:30 p.m.,
you partook a plate of chicken parmesan.

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:40.944
Chicken isn't vegan?

01:10:41.613 --> 01:10:43.655
The de-veganizing ray.
Hit him.

01:10:59.797 --> 01:11:01.256
Oh, my God!

01:11:01.341 --> 01:11:03.884
No. No.

01:11:04.969 --> 01:11:07.346
You once were a vegone,

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:09.640
but now you will be gone.

01:11:09.807 --> 01:11:10.974
Vegone?

01:11:25.907 --> 01:11:28.075
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:11:33.998 --> 01:11:35.999
Sorry, I guess.

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:39.002
Sorry?

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:42.547
You just headbutted my
boyfriend so hard he burst.

01:11:43.633 --> 01:11:47.219
You kicked my heart in the ass,
so I guess we're even.

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.180
Natalie.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:55.352
Natalie? No one
calls me that anymore.

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:58.188
Maybe they should.

01:12:01.192 --> 01:12:02.901
Let's get out of here.

01:12:10.451 --> 01:12:13.370
For the record,
I am so pissed off for you, right now.

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:15.288
Shut the up, Julie.

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:16.665
Okay.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:19.501
We're still going to
the after-party, right?

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:21.378
I'm not sure there's going
to be much of a party.

01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:23.130
I think a third of the
band just went "poom."

01:12:23.214 --> 01:12:25.841
Yeah, cool bands never go
to their own after-parties.

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:28.677
Just the desperate people trying
to rub elbows with the label guys.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.721
Then why would we... Oh.

01:12:30.805 --> 01:12:32.889
Neil, you down?

01:12:32.974 --> 01:12:34.266
Scott, you're in, right?

01:12:35.268 --> 01:12:36.393
You wanna go?

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:39.771
Well, I kind of almost died back there.

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:40.897
I'm not saying I want to go.

01:12:41.065 --> 01:12:42.107
Yeah.
We can totally go.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:43.191
I'll do whatever you want to do.

01:12:43.276 --> 01:12:44.276
So, let's go.

01:12:45.528 --> 01:12:47.237
We really don't have
to go to this thing.

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:49.114
It'll probably be a
bad scene all around.

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:51.533
No, I'm fine.
It's just...

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:53.243
It's just... Well...

01:12:54.454 --> 01:12:57.497
Have you ever dated someone
that wasn't a total ass?

01:12:57.582 --> 01:12:59.332
So far,
you're not a total ass.

01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:00.584
But I'm part ass?

01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:02.794
If it makes you feel better,
you're the nicest guy I've dated.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:03.879
Wait, is that good?

01:13:03.963 --> 01:13:05.130
It's what I need right now.

01:13:05.214 --> 01:13:06.214
But not later?

01:13:06.299 --> 01:13:08.133
Scott, I don't have
all the answers, okay?

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.927
I'd just like to try and
live in the moment if I can.

01:13:11.012 --> 01:13:12.596
I'd just like to live.

01:13:13.056 --> 01:13:14.514
Look, I know Todd was bad news,

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:16.016
but are you saying Envy wasn't?

01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.434
We all have baggage.

01:13:17.518 --> 01:13:20.562
Well, my baggage doesn't try
and kill me every five minutes.

01:13:20.646 --> 01:13:22.522
What did you do to make
your ex-boyfriend so insane?

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:23.899
Exes.
Whatever.

01:13:23.983 --> 01:13:26.151
No breakup is painless,
somebody always gets hurt.

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:28.779
What about you and that girl, Knives?
Who broke up with who?

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:31.448
I believe I broke up with her.

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:32.824
And was she cool with that?

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.368
Knives is with Young Neil now.
She's totally cool with it.

01:13:35.453 --> 01:13:36.453
You sure about that?

01:13:36.537 --> 01:13:38.080
Yeah, she's very mature for her age.

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:39.414
We had a very healthy breakup.

01:13:39.499 --> 01:13:40.707
We're all peaches and gravy.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.084
No!

01:13:42.251 --> 01:13:43.710
What about you and Kim?

01:13:43.795 --> 01:13:45.962
Me and Kim?
I can barely remember.

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:48.048
It was high school.
She had freckles.

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:49.299
That's it?

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:52.385
Yeah, it kind of ended.
We changed.

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:53.553
That's really the whole story?

01:13:53.638 --> 01:13:55.514
Okay, fine, I had to fight
a guy to be with her. Okay?

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:58.225
I fought a crazy, 80-foot-tall,
purple-suited dude

01:13:58.309 --> 01:14:00.393
and I had to fight 96
guys to get to him.

01:14:00.478 --> 01:14:03.105
He was flying and shooting
lightning bolts from his eyes, okay?

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:05.607
And I kicked him so hard that he
saw the curvature of the earth.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:08.110
Does that make you feel any better?

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:10.987
Well, now you are being a total ass.
Welcome to the club.

01:14:11.823 --> 01:14:14.032
I'm sorry.
I'm not usually like this.

01:14:14.117 --> 01:14:17.661
Hey, don't worry.
I don't even know what I'm like anymore.

01:14:18.538 --> 01:14:21.331
I think this ex-boyfriends
thing is messing with my head.

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:22.791
Exes.
Why do you keep saying that?

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.008
The girl from earlier?

01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:34.594
Roxy?
You know this girl?

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:37.681
Boy, does she know me.

01:14:37.890 --> 01:14:40.100
What is she talking about?

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.893
He really doesn't know?

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:44.354
Wait.

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:46.231
Hmm?

01:14:49.152 --> 01:14:51.111
You and her?
It was just a phase.

01:14:51.195 --> 01:14:52.821
Just a phase?
You had a sexy phase?

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:54.406
It meant nothing.
I didn't think it would count.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:55.532
It meant nothing?

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:56.825
I was just a little bi-curious.

01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:58.451
Well, honey,

01:14:58.536 --> 01:15:01.413
I'm a little bi-furious.

01:15:13.092 --> 01:15:15.177
Do that again and I will end you.

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:16.720
Back off, hasbian.

01:15:17.221 --> 01:15:19.723
If Gideon can't have you,
no one can.

01:15:21.434 --> 01:15:23.476
The League has spoken.

01:15:24.395 --> 01:15:26.646
Well, then Gideon best get
his pretentious ass up here

01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:29.399
because I'm about to kick yours
out of the Great White North.

01:15:43.748 --> 01:15:44.998
Wallace?
Uh-huh?

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:47.292
This is happening, right?
Oh, yeah.

01:15:47.501 --> 01:15:49.002
Kick her in the balls.

01:16:11.692 --> 01:16:12.901
I'm sending you back to Gideon

01:16:12.985 --> 01:16:14.736
in a thousand pieces,
you slag!

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:18.198
Ha!

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:25.372
I'd rather be dead than go back.

01:16:25.456 --> 01:16:26.790
He's a creep,
you're a bitch,

01:16:26.874 --> 01:16:28.041
and you all deserve each other.

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:30.293
Give it a rest, Ramona.
This is a League game.

01:16:30.378 --> 01:16:31.461
Meaning?

01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:35.131
Meaning your precious Scott must
defeat me with his own fists.

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:40.512
I don't think I can hit a girl.
They're soft.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:41.721
You don't have a choice.

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:02.993
Fight your own battles,
lazy ass!

01:17:09.583 --> 01:17:10.709
Lazy ass!

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:19.676
Every Pilgrim reaches
the end of his journey.

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:21.678
Some sooner than others.

01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:28.685
Your BF's about to get F'd in the B.

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:31.813
Her weak point is the back of her knees.

01:17:31.897 --> 01:17:33.606
Wait, how does that work?

01:17:33.816 --> 01:17:36.276
Whenever we were making
out I would just...

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.819
Okay, enough.

01:17:46.203 --> 01:17:51.750
You'll never be able to do this to her.

01:18:05.723 --> 01:18:06.890
So...

01:18:06.974 --> 01:18:08.391
Two gin-and-tonics, please?

01:18:08.476 --> 01:18:09.642
I thought you didn't drink.

01:18:09.727 --> 01:18:12.562
Only on special occasions.
Why? Did you want one?

01:18:13.230 --> 01:18:15.607
Guess we really don't know that
much about each other, do we?

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:18.651
Maybe you could just give me
a list of all of your exes

01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:20.362
so that I can at least
know who's going to

01:18:20.446 --> 01:18:22.030
beat my ass into the ground next.

01:18:22.114 --> 01:18:24.783
Like a handy little laminate or
something? Let me see if I have one.

01:18:24.867 --> 01:18:26.326
Maybe we could exchange our information.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:28.787
Hey, just out of sheer
curiosity and concern

01:18:28.871 --> 01:18:30.121
for my mortal well-being,

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:33.249
is there anyone at this party
that you haven't slept with?

01:18:37.963 --> 01:18:39.672
I think we should split.

01:18:39.757 --> 01:18:42.175
As in get out of here,
or as in split, split?

01:18:42.259 --> 01:18:43.718
I'd hope you could figure that out.

01:18:43.803 --> 01:18:45.762
Or did you miss the part
where I saved your ass?

01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:48.556
How could I? I feel like we just
washed our sexy laundry in public.

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:49.891
Dirty laundry.
You're drunk.

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:51.226
I had, like,
one drink.

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:55.021
I'm sorry I cared. I don't enjoy all
this, Scott. In fact, I'm sick of it.

01:18:55.106 --> 01:18:56.106
I thought you might be
more understanding.

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:57.357
I just...

01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:59.943
You're just another evil
ex waiting to happen.

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:04.572
That was harsh.

01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:07.909
That was not good.

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:11.121
That was embarrassing.

01:19:12.289 --> 01:19:13.498
One more.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.583
P.S. Here's your stupid list.

01:19:17.253 --> 01:19:20.213
Matthew Patel, Lucas Lee,
Todd Ingram, Roxy Richter.

01:19:20.297 --> 01:19:23.007
Who the hell are the Katayanagi Twins?

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:26.803
You don't know?

01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:28.221
The Katayanagi Twins

01:19:28.305 --> 01:19:30.723
just happen to be the
next band in the battle.

01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:34.519
They are totally bad-ass.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.563
Ramona dated twins?
Apparently.

01:19:36.647 --> 01:19:37.730
At the same time?

01:19:37.815 --> 01:19:38.815
You know what?

01:19:38.899 --> 01:19:40.233
I don't know and I don't want to know.

01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:43.069
Good. Because you know how I feel
about girls blocking the rock.

01:19:43.154 --> 01:19:44.737
Good, I play better
when I'm in a bad mood.

01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:45.947
If it's gonna be an issue though,

01:19:46.031 --> 01:19:47.073
Young Neil can fill in for you.

01:19:47.158 --> 01:19:48.491
It's not an issue.
You know bands,

01:19:48.576 --> 01:19:49.993
I know battles.
We got it covered.

01:19:50.202 --> 01:19:51.995
But we'd understand if you
didn't want to take part.

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:53.371
Not only do I want to take part

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:55.248
I want to take them apart.

01:19:55.666 --> 01:19:57.709
Okay, I'm getting tingles.

01:19:57.793 --> 01:19:58.877
Whoa!

01:20:00.588 --> 01:20:02.422
Okay, we're doomed.
Oh!

01:20:02.506 --> 01:20:04.799
That poster needs more
exclamation marks.

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:06.843
Oh, man,
we're gonna get killed.

01:20:06.927 --> 01:20:08.511
Come on, we're going
on in five minutes.

01:20:09.013 --> 01:20:10.972
Wait, aren't the
Katayanagis going on first?

01:20:11.056 --> 01:20:13.516
I think you're both on first.

01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:16.102
Wait, "Amp versus amp"?

01:20:16.187 --> 01:20:17.812
We're going on stage at the same time?

01:20:17.897 --> 01:20:19.230
That's impossible.

01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:21.983
Okay, my bad.

01:20:22.067 --> 01:20:24.110
Your bad is
saying, "My bad."

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:28.114
We shouldn't even be here.
We shouldn't even be here!

01:20:28.199 --> 01:20:30.533
Come on, man!
I put my problems aside for the music.

01:20:30.618 --> 01:20:31.951
If I can do that,
we can do anything.

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:33.578
Did you speak to Ramona, then?

01:20:33.662 --> 01:20:36.539
What? No. I haven't seen
her since the other night.

01:20:36.624 --> 01:20:37.624
Oh.

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:39.000
She's totally here.

01:20:41.921 --> 01:20:43.046
Scott?

01:20:44.048 --> 01:20:45.423
Not that I care,

01:20:45.508 --> 01:20:47.550
but you should go talk
to her before she's gone.

01:20:48.135 --> 01:20:49.135
Thanks, Kim.

01:20:49.220 --> 01:20:50.345
And I really don't care.

01:20:52.223 --> 01:20:53.681
I didn't mean to put
you through all that.

01:20:53.766 --> 01:20:56.309
I only did it because I love you.
You know that.

01:21:33.806 --> 01:21:35.598
Okay, gang,
can we do this?

01:21:36.225 --> 01:21:37.433
I mean,
we can do this, right?

01:21:37.518 --> 01:21:38.601
Right.

01:21:38.686 --> 01:21:39.936
Scott?

01:21:41.855 --> 01:21:42.939
Scott!

01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:02.458
They tore the roof off!

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:07.797
We are Sex Bob-Omb

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:10.842
and we're here to make you think
about death and get sad and stuff!

01:22:13.512 --> 01:22:15.597
This is the beginning of the song.

01:22:16.515 --> 01:22:19.225
I'm hearing voices,
animal noises

01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:20.643
The crème de la crème

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:22.228
The feminine abyss

01:22:22.313 --> 01:22:25.815
And reaching my threshold Staring
at the truth 'til I'm blind

01:22:27.901 --> 01:22:29.319
My body's stupid

01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:30.737
Stereo putrid

01:22:30.821 --> 01:22:32.363
Spilling out music

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:33.781
Into raw sewage

01:22:33.866 --> 01:22:37.035
Reaching my threshold Staring
at the truth 'til I'm blind

01:22:42.458 --> 01:22:47.879
My threshold

01:22:48.213 --> 01:22:50.089
Reaching

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:53.760
My threshold

01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:07.899
Let's just break up now
and get it over with.

01:23:07.983 --> 01:23:11.486
We screwed the pooch in front
of Gideon Graves. We're done!

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:13.488
Gideon's here?
Where?

01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:15.698
That geeky guy next to your girlfriend.

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:19.410
That's Gideon?

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:21.704
Gideon is G-Man?

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:24.040
All right,
let's do this.

01:23:26.502 --> 01:23:28.961
Reaching my threshold

01:23:29.046 --> 01:23:37.512
My threshold

01:24:23.559 --> 01:24:24.726
We're out.

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:30.648
What are you doing?

01:24:30.733 --> 01:24:31.941
Getting a life.

01:24:45.622 --> 01:24:47.999
I just came to see your show.

01:24:51.128 --> 01:24:52.378
I have to...

01:25:00.304 --> 01:25:01.888
Ramona.

01:25:02.639 --> 01:25:05.516
Ramona, I need to tell you something.

01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:06.893
Yeah, I have something
I have to tell you, too.

01:25:06.977 --> 01:25:09.020
Great. Listen, I know you
play mysterious and aloof

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:10.521
just to avoid getting hurt.

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:14.692
I know you have reasons for not
wanting to talk about your past.

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:18.404
I want you to know I don't
care about any of that stuff

01:25:18.489 --> 01:25:20.406
because I'm in lesbians with you.

01:25:20.866 --> 01:25:21.908
What?

01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:23.326
I really,
really mean it.

01:25:25.704 --> 01:25:27.330
Oh! Okay.

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:28.956
It's your turn.
What did you want to tell me?

01:25:30.751 --> 01:25:32.293
That we have to break up.

01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:34.545
What?

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.088
It's Gideon.

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:38.591
I just can't...

01:25:41.011 --> 01:25:42.428
I can't help myself around him.

01:25:42.513 --> 01:25:44.388
That's the bad news.

01:25:45.182 --> 01:25:46.432
Hey.

01:25:46.517 --> 01:25:49.894
The good news is that I'm
officially loving the Sex-Bombs.

01:25:49.978 --> 01:25:51.562
Bob-Omb.
Three-piece rock outfit

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:54.023
with a smoking hot red-head on drums.

01:25:54.107 --> 01:25:55.942
Music to my ear-holes.

01:25:57.069 --> 01:25:58.986
You know what?
I'm not even going to wait

01:25:59.071 --> 01:26:00.530
to see how you guys do in the final.

01:26:00.614 --> 01:26:03.032
I'm signing you right now
for a three-album contract.

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:06.577
See? I'm not such
a bad guy after all.

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:09.956
You think we're going to sell our
souls to you? Well, guess again.

01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.376
No, I can't be a part of the
band with this douche in charge.

01:26:13.877 --> 01:26:15.586
Ow! Scott.

01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:18.756
You got to try and keep
your emotions in check, man.

01:26:18.841 --> 01:26:21.509
Don't let what's past ruin your future.

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:23.177
The people need to hear us, Scott.

01:26:23.262 --> 01:26:25.847
Then you're gonna have to find
someone else to play bass.

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:28.683
Whoops.

01:26:29.726 --> 01:26:33.479
Sign, sign, sign,
and we are all set.

01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:35.982
Sweetie, shall we?

01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:44.657
Oh! Scott.

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:47.493
You know,
we really should be thanking each other.

01:26:47.578 --> 01:26:50.288
I mean, if it wasn't for me,
Ramona would never have been with you

01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:52.373
but if it wasn't for you she
wouldn't have gotten back with me,

01:26:52.457 --> 01:26:54.333
so I guess it all shakes out.

01:26:55.794 --> 01:26:57.628
Scotty, buddy,

01:26:59.965 --> 01:27:03.718
between you and I,
the whole League of Evil Exes thing?

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:07.680
I was in a really dark place
when I put that together, so...

01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:09.932
Forgiven?

01:27:10.392 --> 01:27:12.226
All right, let's go.

01:27:12.936 --> 01:27:14.145
Yes!

01:27:14.938 --> 01:27:18.024
This is it, guys.
We are on our way.

01:27:21.737 --> 01:27:23.446
I said "lesbians."

01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:53.434
Scott.

01:27:54.478 --> 01:27:55.811
Was she really the one?

01:27:56.605 --> 01:27:57.730
The what?

01:27:57.814 --> 01:28:00.149
I mean, did you really see
a future with this girl?

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:04.654
Like, with jetpacks.

01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:13.621
Time heals all wounds,
little brother.

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:18.167
Maybe next time we don't date the
girl with 11 evil ex-boyfriends.

01:28:18.502 --> 01:28:19.502
Seven.

01:28:19.670 --> 01:28:20.711
That's not that bad.

01:28:23.006 --> 01:28:24.757
Hey. Yeah, I know.

01:28:24.967 --> 01:28:27.343
It's so pathetic!

01:28:30.013 --> 01:28:31.931
Turn off the light!

01:28:35.018 --> 01:28:37.728
Presumably, you just saw some guy's junk

01:28:38.063 --> 01:28:39.271
and I apologize for that.

01:28:39.356 --> 01:28:40.398
Okay.

01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:42.191
And he apologizes, too.

01:28:42.275 --> 01:28:43.359
Sorry.

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:47.655
Scott, you know I love you.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:50.324
But I'm gonna need my own bed tonight.

01:28:50.867 --> 01:28:52.535
It's for sex.

01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:54.245
Right.

01:28:54.997 --> 01:28:58.040
I may need it for the
rest of the week, too.

01:28:58.375 --> 01:28:59.583
Right.

01:28:59.668 --> 01:29:00.751
And the year.

01:29:01.378 --> 01:29:02.628
I get it.

01:29:02.713 --> 01:29:04.422
Maybe you can move in with Ramona.

01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:07.133
She's with Gideon.

01:29:07.217 --> 01:29:08.467
Oh, man.

01:29:08.552 --> 01:29:10.636
That's probably just because
he's better than you.

01:29:10.721 --> 01:29:11.804
Mmm.

01:29:11.888 --> 01:29:14.849
Either way,
this fight is over.

01:29:15.308 --> 01:29:16.308
Mmm-hmm.

01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:26.360
It's for Scott.

01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:28.571
It's for you,
big guy.

01:29:30.657 --> 01:29:31.657
Hello.

01:29:31.742 --> 01:29:32.908
Hey, pal.

01:29:33.368 --> 01:29:35.828
I just want to say I feel
terrible about earlier.

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:37.913
I don't want any hard feelings.

01:29:37.998 --> 01:29:41.417
So I figured, why not be the bigger
man and just give you a call.

01:29:41.501 --> 01:29:43.002
Is Ramona with you?

01:29:43.754 --> 01:29:46.505
I don't know.
Are you with me?

01:29:48.091 --> 01:29:49.133
Yeah.

01:29:50.635 --> 01:29:53.262
Geez, buddy,
it's gonna be all right.

01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:56.140
No, I just spilled hot
cocoa on my crotch.

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:57.308
Mmm-hmm.

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:58.768
Listen, as you know,

01:29:58.852 --> 01:30:00.853
I'm opening a new Chaos
Theatre in Toronto.

01:30:00.937 --> 01:30:03.189
And the Sex-Bobs are playing
our grand opening tonight.

01:30:03.273 --> 01:30:06.108
It would feel really weird for
all of us if you weren't there.

01:30:06.193 --> 01:30:09.987
They just did a sound check and
the acoustics in here are amazing!

01:30:10.072 --> 01:30:11.405
Yeah?
Maybe I'll see you there.

01:30:11.531 --> 01:30:12.865
I hope so, amigo.

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.618
I don't want any more
bad blood between exes.

01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:16.744
What do you say?

01:30:16.828 --> 01:30:17.870
Mmm.

01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:19.205
Okay, laters.

01:30:19.790 --> 01:30:21.290
What a perfect asshole.

01:30:23.794 --> 01:30:26.670
Forget what I said earlier.
Finish him.

01:30:51.154 --> 01:30:52.321
Password?

01:30:52.405 --> 01:30:53.489
Whatever.

01:30:54.032 --> 01:30:55.116
Cool.

01:30:59.496 --> 01:31:00.871
Second password?

01:31:03.667 --> 01:31:04.708
Cool.

01:31:08.922 --> 01:31:11.423
We're not having no fun
We're not having no fun

01:31:11.508 --> 01:31:14.969
No. The first album is much
better than the first album.

01:31:15.053 --> 01:31:17.179
Fun

01:31:17.806 --> 01:31:20.516
No fun

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:27.898
Scott! Let it go.

01:31:28.608 --> 01:31:30.109
Don't give him the satisfaction.

01:31:30.193 --> 01:31:32.319
What if I want the satisfaction?

01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:33.737
Scott Pilgrim!

01:31:35.532 --> 01:31:37.825
Buddy, welcome to the Chaos Theatre.

01:31:38.201 --> 01:31:41.704
Somebody get this man a drink.
A Coke Zero, right?

01:31:47.252 --> 01:31:48.961
I'm not here to drink.

01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:51.338
Whoa, I've got no beef with you.

01:31:52.132 --> 01:31:54.884
What if I have a beef with you?

01:31:55.218 --> 01:31:58.053
Are you still mad about the
whole thing with The Guild?

01:31:58.346 --> 01:31:59.471
You mean The League?

01:31:59.556 --> 01:32:01.974
The Guild, League, whatever.
It's ancient history.

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:03.726
I'll show you how
ancient of history it is!

01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:05.060
Wait, wait, wait!

01:32:05.562 --> 01:32:08.230
There's no use crying
over spilt Coke, buddy.

01:32:08.315 --> 01:32:12.943
The lady made her choice and we're
all just gonna have to move on.

01:32:13.028 --> 01:32:14.987
Well, I ain't moving, buddy.

01:32:16.114 --> 01:32:19.366
You wanna fight me for her?

01:32:19.451 --> 01:32:25.080
Was that not clear?

01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:26.248
I don't know.

01:32:26.333 --> 01:32:31.503
Now, why on earth would
you want to do that?

01:32:31.922 --> 01:32:33.589
Because I'm in love with her.

01:32:44.559 --> 01:32:47.603
Aw! I think this
deserves a song.

01:32:47.687 --> 01:32:48.938
Kimberly!

01:32:49.272 --> 01:32:51.190
We are Sex Bob-Omb.

01:32:51.274 --> 01:32:54.610
We are here to make money
and sell out and stuff.

01:32:54.694 --> 01:32:55.903
One, two, three, four!

01:33:53.169 --> 01:33:54.878
Your club sucks,
by the way.

01:33:54.963 --> 01:33:59.550
Well, if my cathedral of
cutting-edge taste holds no interest

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:02.428
for your tragically
Canadian sensibilities,

01:34:02.512 --> 01:34:07.182
then I shall be forced to grant
you a swift exit from the premises.

01:34:08.435 --> 01:34:11.312
And a fast entrance into hell!

01:34:11.396 --> 01:34:13.355
Scott!

01:34:17.569 --> 01:34:19.028
Knives?

01:34:19.112 --> 01:34:20.404
That's priceless.

01:34:20.488 --> 01:34:22.323
You'll pay for what you did to him.

01:34:22.407 --> 01:34:24.450
Listen, Kung Pao Chicken,

01:34:24.534 --> 01:34:27.328
your old, old boyfriend
brought this all on himself.

01:34:27.412 --> 01:34:30.205
He was warned plenty of times,
but did he listen? No.

01:34:30.290 --> 01:34:32.791
I'm not talking to you.
I'm talking to her!

01:34:34.044 --> 01:34:35.127
What?

01:34:35.211 --> 01:34:36.920
You broke the heart that broke mine.

01:34:37.005 --> 01:34:39.298
Get ready to Chau down!

01:34:44.554 --> 01:34:45.763
You're kidding, right?

01:34:49.059 --> 01:34:50.142
Wow!

01:34:50.226 --> 01:34:53.354
I mean, you can't say I don't
know how to put on a show, right?

01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:54.855
That's incredible.

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:07.743
What the hell is your deal?

01:35:10.121 --> 01:35:11.497
You stole him!

01:35:13.041 --> 01:35:14.166
Stole him!

01:35:14.250 --> 01:35:16.043
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:35:16.127 --> 01:35:18.587
You liar! Liar!

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.257
I didn't steal your boyfriend!
I didn't steal Scott!

01:35:22.759 --> 01:35:24.760
I didn't steal anyone!

01:35:32.519 --> 01:35:34.937
You steal my boyfriend!

01:35:35.021 --> 01:35:36.188
Wait! Wait!

01:35:36.272 --> 01:35:39.233
Can we please stop all this fighting?
Nobody stole anybody.

01:35:39.317 --> 01:35:42.152
Knives, I dated you and
then I dated Ramona, okay?

01:35:45.824 --> 01:35:48.492
Maybe I forgot to tell
Knives right away.

01:35:49.536 --> 01:35:50.994
You cheated on me, Scott?

01:35:52.664 --> 01:35:54.706
You cheated on both of us?

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:56.500
You cheated on me with Knives?

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.168
No,

01:35:59.462 --> 01:36:02.005
I cheated on Knives with you.

01:36:02.465 --> 01:36:03.590
Is there a difference?

01:36:04.342 --> 01:36:05.551
You weren't wronged?

01:36:07.053 --> 01:36:08.178
Right?

01:36:09.639 --> 01:36:12.182
Game over.

01:36:17.105 --> 01:36:18.313
Scotty,

01:36:18.815 --> 01:36:21.817
you can cheat on these
ladies all you like.

01:36:22.235 --> 01:36:25.070
But you can't cheat

01:36:26.322 --> 01:36:27.448
death.

01:36:34.664 --> 01:36:36.290
Oh, man.

01:36:36.499 --> 01:36:40.544
Sorry.
Dying's got to suck.

01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:44.256
You know what sucks?
Getting killed by that guy.

01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:47.134
Why him?

01:36:47.218 --> 01:36:48.802
It's complicated.

01:36:48.887 --> 01:36:51.013
Well, I'm not going anywhere,

01:36:52.348 --> 01:36:54.349
so now might be a good
time to get into it.

01:36:55.685 --> 01:36:59.563
Truth is, it was me
who was obsessed.

01:37:01.316 --> 01:37:04.651
I was crazy about him.
But he ignored me.

01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:09.823
I was more alone when we were
together than I ever was on my own.

01:37:10.492 --> 01:37:13.035
That's why I had to leave.

01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:16.246
And that's when he
started paying attention.

01:37:16.539 --> 01:37:17.956
So, why go back?

01:37:18.249 --> 01:37:19.875
I can't help myself around him, Scott,

01:37:19.959 --> 01:37:23.879
he just has this way of
getting into my head.

01:37:24.797 --> 01:37:27.049
Well, that's legitimately disappointing.

01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:29.259
I really will leave
you alone forever now.

01:37:29.344 --> 01:37:31.887
No, he literally has a way
of getting into my head.

01:37:33.389 --> 01:37:35.390
That is evil.

01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:40.270
I didn't mean for you to get
dragged into this, Scott.

01:37:40.897 --> 01:37:43.315
I just wanted something simple.

01:37:44.734 --> 01:37:46.818
I'm sorry it had to end this way.

01:37:47.445 --> 01:37:49.404
Well, I really fought for you.

01:37:49.572 --> 01:37:52.407
Maybe I'm not the one you
should have been fighting for.

01:37:55.328 --> 01:37:57.246
What? Wait.

01:37:58.081 --> 01:38:02.000
But I feel like I learned something.

01:38:03.586 --> 01:38:05.587
Which would be great if I wasn't dead.

01:38:09.425 --> 01:38:11.009
So alone.

01:38:11.094 --> 01:38:12.302
You're not alone.

01:38:15.098 --> 01:38:16.181
Right!

01:38:26.067 --> 01:38:27.317
Your hair looks stupid.

01:38:29.612 --> 01:38:30.988
Second password?

01:38:34.867 --> 01:38:35.951
Yeah, I saw it.

01:38:36.035 --> 01:38:38.161
It's just the comic book
is better than the movie.

01:38:38.246 --> 01:38:39.621
No fun

01:38:40.498 --> 01:38:42.040
Scott! Let it go.

01:38:42.125 --> 01:38:43.417
Don't worry,
I know what I'm doing.

01:38:43.501 --> 01:38:44.668
Stephen, the new lineup rocks.

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:46.128
You guys sound way better without me.

01:38:46.421 --> 01:38:48.088
Young Neil,
you have learned well.

01:38:48.172 --> 01:38:51.550
From this point forward you
will be known as "Neil."

01:38:51.884 --> 01:38:53.010
And, Kim,

01:38:53.928 --> 01:38:56.096
I'm sorry about everything.

01:38:57.348 --> 01:38:58.807
I'm sorry about me.

01:39:00.143 --> 01:39:02.352
Scott Pilgrim!
Hey, buddy!

01:39:02.437 --> 01:39:05.897
Save it! You're pretentious!
This club sucks!

01:39:05.982 --> 01:39:07.482
I've got beef.
Let's do it.

01:39:07.567 --> 01:39:09.234
Wait, wait, wait!

01:39:10.653 --> 01:39:14.281
You want to fight me for her?

01:39:14.365 --> 01:39:15.657
No.

01:39:16.326 --> 01:39:17.701
I want to fight you for me.

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:25.500
Um... Kim!

01:39:25.585 --> 01:39:28.086
We are Sex Bob-Omb and
we are here to watch

01:39:28.171 --> 01:39:30.589
Scott Pilgrim kick your teeth in!

01:39:30.673 --> 01:39:31.798
One! Two!
Three! Four!

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:54.404
How's it going back there?

01:39:55.698 --> 01:39:57.866
You dick!

01:39:58.826 --> 01:40:00.160
Knives?

01:40:00.244 --> 01:40:01.787
I know you're in here.
Don't attack...

01:40:01.871 --> 01:40:03.580
Scott!

01:40:05.792 --> 01:40:07.542
Steal my boyfriend!

01:40:07.627 --> 01:40:08.919
Taste my steel!

01:40:09.962 --> 01:40:10.962
Enough!

01:40:11.047 --> 01:40:12.172
No, Scott.

01:40:12.548 --> 01:40:15.133
This fat-ass hurt me and
I will have my revenge!

01:40:15.218 --> 01:40:19.054
No, Knives, I hurt you.
I cheated on you.

01:40:20.723 --> 01:40:22.724
I cheated on both of you.

01:40:24.727 --> 01:40:26.478
I'm really sorry.

01:40:27.063 --> 01:40:28.563
And you're not a fat-ass.

01:40:29.148 --> 01:40:31.024
She didn't mean that.

01:40:33.403 --> 01:40:34.778
So, are we all good?

01:40:38.032 --> 01:40:39.491
Never felt better.

01:40:39.575 --> 01:40:40.992
Yoo-hoo!

01:40:42.078 --> 01:40:44.621
Are we done with the
hugging and learning?

01:40:45.915 --> 01:40:47.958
I thought we had a fight going on here!

01:40:48.209 --> 01:40:49.584
You've got a fight,
all right!

01:40:51.379 --> 01:40:52.421
Wrong move, baby.

01:41:08.813 --> 01:41:09.938
Hey.

01:41:24.328 --> 01:41:27.330
You made me swallow my gum.

01:41:29.584 --> 01:41:32.627
It's gonna be in my digestive
tract for seven years.

01:42:16.506 --> 01:42:19.049
Yeah, still my girl.

01:42:22.303 --> 01:42:23.512
Let's both be girls.

01:42:28.726 --> 01:42:30.977
Bad! Bad!

01:42:43.157 --> 01:42:44.115
What?

01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:45.367
Get ready!

01:42:46.244 --> 01:42:47.536
Here we go!

01:42:56.712 --> 01:42:59.047
Good! Good! Good!

01:42:59.507 --> 01:43:00.757
Combo!

01:43:05.054 --> 01:43:06.179
Perfect!

01:43:18.776 --> 01:43:21.903
Who do you think you are, Pilgrim?

01:43:21.988 --> 01:43:24.406
You think you're better than me?

01:43:25.366 --> 01:43:27.617
I'll tell you what you are.

01:43:27.702 --> 01:43:29.703
A pain in my ass!

01:43:30.371 --> 01:43:34.082
You know how long it took

01:43:34.292 --> 01:43:36.877
to get all the evil exes'
contact information

01:43:36.961 --> 01:43:39.546
so I could form this stupid league?

01:43:39.630 --> 01:43:43.216
Like, two hours!
Two hours!

01:43:45.803 --> 01:43:47.929
You're not cool enough for Ramona.

01:43:48.306 --> 01:43:50.599
You're zero!
You're nothing!

01:43:50.975 --> 01:43:53.101
Me? I'm what's hip.

01:43:53.185 --> 01:43:54.603
I'm what's happening!

01:43:54.687 --> 01:43:56.605
I'm blowing up right now!

01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:58.648
You are blowing up.

01:43:59.358 --> 01:44:00.609
Right now!

01:44:01.944 --> 01:44:04.446
K-O!

01:44:13.497 --> 01:44:16.583
Wow!

01:44:18.711 --> 01:44:23.465
Yeah, wow.

01:44:29.889 --> 01:44:31.389
There goes our deal!

01:44:31.474 --> 01:44:33.600
We're still getting paid, right?

01:44:33.684 --> 01:44:36.061
There goes our deal.

01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:38.688
Oh! Oh, God!

01:44:49.492 --> 01:44:50.909
You two make a good combo.

01:44:51.911 --> 01:44:53.078
Yeah?

01:44:54.038 --> 01:44:55.080
Yeah.

01:44:55.164 --> 01:44:58.333
Scott Pilgrim.

01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:04.214
You can defeat me, Scott,

01:45:04.674 --> 01:45:08.218
but can you defeat yourself?

01:45:15.685 --> 01:45:16.851
Nega Scott.

01:45:16.978 --> 01:45:18.520
Nega Scott!

01:45:22.566 --> 01:45:23.817
No.

01:45:24.026 --> 01:45:25.944
This is something I have to face.

01:45:29.198 --> 01:45:30.323
Myself.

01:45:32.451 --> 01:45:34.703
Solo round!

01:45:36.122 --> 01:45:39.624
They have this incredible
French toast with bananas on it

01:45:39.709 --> 01:45:40.917
and you get bacon on the side.

01:45:41.002 --> 01:45:42.127
I'm liking that.

01:45:42.211 --> 01:45:43.878
Let's do it next week.
Yeah, Tuesday.

01:45:43.963 --> 01:45:45.088
Yeah, all right.
Be good.

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:46.256
Yeah, yeah.

01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:47.632
Hey.

01:45:49.051 --> 01:45:50.468
What happened?

01:45:50.553 --> 01:45:53.471
Nothing, we just shot the shit.
He's just a really nice guy.

01:45:53.556 --> 01:45:55.265
We're gonna get brunch next week.

01:45:55.391 --> 01:45:57.142
We actually have a lot in common.

01:45:57.226 --> 01:46:00.228
Your hair,
it's getting really shaggy.

01:46:00.813 --> 01:46:02.522
It is?
Yeah.

01:46:03.941 --> 01:46:06.234
You should probably get it cut.

01:46:07.069 --> 01:46:08.528
Yeah, you're right.

01:46:08.779 --> 01:46:09.988
I should get it cut.

01:46:10.072 --> 01:46:11.573
At a salon.

01:46:11.657 --> 01:46:13.992
Salon, yeah.
That sounds really nice.

01:46:14.076 --> 01:46:15.493
Hey.

01:46:16.787 --> 01:46:18.038
You're going?

01:46:18.581 --> 01:46:20.540
I should probably disappear.

01:46:20.958 --> 01:46:22.333
After all that?

01:46:23.085 --> 01:46:25.086
I still need a new life.

01:46:25.921 --> 01:46:29.424
I came here to escape,
but the past keeps catching up.

01:46:30.384 --> 01:46:32.510
I'm tired of people
getting hurt because of me.

01:46:32.595 --> 01:46:34.929
I'm pretty sure I'm gonna get over it.

01:46:35.598 --> 01:46:37.599
I don't mean just you.

01:46:40.436 --> 01:46:42.145
I understand.

01:46:43.981 --> 01:46:45.732
I should thank you, though.

01:46:45.816 --> 01:46:47.233
For what?

01:46:49.361 --> 01:46:52.322
For being the nicest guy I ever dated.

01:46:54.325 --> 01:46:56.117
That's kind of sad.

01:46:58.662 --> 01:47:00.455
It is kind of sad.

01:47:03.793 --> 01:47:05.293
Bye, and stuff.

01:47:06.504 --> 01:47:09.923
Yeah. And stuff.

01:47:15.304 --> 01:47:17.222
Go, get her.

01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:19.599
What?

01:47:19.683 --> 01:47:22.435
You've been fighting for her all along.

01:47:24.730 --> 01:47:26.147
But what about you?

01:47:26.982 --> 01:47:28.775
I'll be fine.

01:47:32.905 --> 01:47:35.448
I'm too cool for you anyway.

01:47:39.912 --> 01:47:41.162
Ciao, Knives.

01:47:41.914 --> 01:47:43.081
Go.

01:47:48.712 --> 01:47:49.963
Hey.

01:47:50.047 --> 01:47:52.423
Hey, mind if I tag along?

01:47:55.010 --> 01:47:56.469
You want to come with me?

01:47:56.846 --> 01:48:00.974
Yeah, I thought maybe
we could try again.

01:48:24.623 --> 01:48:29.711
Continue?
Nine, eight, seven, six,

01:48:29.795 --> 01:48:34.257
five, four, three, two, one.
