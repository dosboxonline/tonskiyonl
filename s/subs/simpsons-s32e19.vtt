Homer, the results of your
physical are very concerning.

00:11.420 --> 00:14.847
-You're 80 pounds overweight.
-I wore my socks on the scale.

00:15.074 --> 00:17.074
And your cholesterol
is sky-high.

00:17.092 --> 00:18.408
Go big or go home.

00:18.460 --> 00:21.687
Oh, and your testosterone
is just a little bit low.

00:21.838 --> 00:23.430
(gasps)
Testosterone?

00:23.582 --> 00:25.340
That's what fuels
my punching and yelling.

00:25.434 --> 00:27.008
And my undeserved confidence.

00:27.028 --> 00:28.268

00:33.367 --> 00:37.052
Don't worry, low T is very
common amongst men your age.

00:37.054 --> 00:38.871
It can be treated
with a prescription drug

00:39.022 --> 00:40.539
called Vicodude.

00:40.690 --> 00:43.784
-Pill me up.
-But before I give you the drug,

00:43.936 --> 00:48.047
I just need you to watch
this short informational video.

00:48.198 --> 00:50.215

Torque is
the tendency of a force

or "Simon Has a Birthmark"?

For your information,
I was going

21:11.829 --> 21:12.995

21:13.014 --> 21:15.273

21:15.466 --> 21:18.609
Honey, whatever phases
you go through,

21:18.761 --> 21:20.836
I'll always be waiting for you

21:20.855 --> 21:23.281
on the other side
of the slammed door.

21:23.432 --> 21:24.840
-Mm.
-Mm.
