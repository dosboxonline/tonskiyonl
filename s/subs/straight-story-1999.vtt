03:09.689 --> 03:10.939
(Woman) Hey, Rose.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.357
Hey, Dorothy.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.755
(Shuffling)

04:23.638 --> 04:26.682
(Thump and groan)

05:18.818 --> 05:21.320
I'm gonna go over there.

05:32.623 --> 05:34.333
We're waitin'.

05:40.006 --> 05:41.423
(Birds)

05:54.979 --> 05:56.772
Alvin.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.274
Alvin Straight!

05:59.275 --> 06:04.279
Rose left a couple of hours ago.

06:04.280 --> 06:09.201
Did you hear me hollerin' for
Rose? I wasn't lookin' for Rose.

06:09.202 --> 06:13.872
- I haven't seen Alvin today.
- Did I ask?

06:13.873 --> 06:15.707
Straight, you're late!

06:21.422 --> 06:23.131
(Mutters)

06:29.097 --> 06:41.358
Alvin!

06:41.359 --> 06:44.736
- Come in, Bud.
- What the... Alvin?!

06:44.737 --> 06:45.987
(Door creaks)

06:45.988 --> 06:48.323
Where the hell are you?

06:48.324 --> 06:51.076
I can't see a thing.

06:51.077 --> 06:54.579
Over here, Bud. Watch your step.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.706
What the hell's going on?

06:56.707 --> 07:00.919
What are you doin'
layin' on the floor? You nuts?

07:00.920 --> 07:04.714
Supposed to be down
at Davmar's one hour ago.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.299
What's going on?

07:06.300 --> 07:09.052
Oh, my God!

07:09.053 --> 07:10.637
(Alvin) Hey, Dorothy.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.473
What's the number for 911?

07:13.474 --> 07:16.393
- No, Dorothy.
- What you doin'?

07:16.394 --> 07:20.564
I'll call the bar
and tell 'em we're not comin'.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.443
Are you crazy?
We have a stricken man here.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.070
Are you stricken, Alvin?

07:27.071 --> 07:30.240
Put the phone down!

07:30.241 --> 07:32.325
Dad, what's all the yellin'?

07:35.455 --> 07:38.748
Wh-what... uh,
have you done to my dad?

07:38.749 --> 07:40.750
Oh, for cry eye!

07:40.751 --> 07:42.836
Dad?

07:42.837 --> 07:44.880
Are you OK, Dad?

07:44.881 --> 07:48.425
I just need a little help
gettin' up, honey.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.555
(Car rattles)

07:57.727 --> 07:59.978
(Engine revs severely)

08:02.607 --> 08:03.857
(Bumps)

08:17.997 --> 08:21.291
I'm goin' to Davmar's.
I'll be right back.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.501
OK, Bud.

08:33.261 --> 08:34.721
I'm not goin'.

08:34.722 --> 08:36.306
Dad.

08:36.307 --> 08:37.557
I'm not goin'.

08:37.558 --> 08:39.768
You promised me, Dad.

08:55.535 --> 08:59.746
OK, Mr Straight,
put this robe on.

08:59.747 --> 09:02.165
Just bring me the doctor.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.672
(Door opens and closes)

09:29.068 --> 09:31.111
(Rose stammers) You like birds.

09:33.781 --> 09:38.493
I build... uh, birdhouses...
uh, for bluebirds.

09:38.494 --> 09:41.204
Oh, that's nice.

09:41.205 --> 09:45.250
Yeah, it's Pete... uh,
Pete sells my...

09:45.251 --> 09:48.628
uh, birdhouses...
at the Ace Hardware.

09:48.629 --> 09:52.424
- I'll look for them next time.
- Yeah?

09:52.425 --> 09:54.759
No operation.

09:54.760 --> 09:59.472
This morning you fall and can't
get up, that's your hips, Alvin.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.808
And you'll need a walker now.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.268
No walker.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.271
Fine, a second cane, then.

10:06.272 --> 10:08.607
You say you're having
trouble seeing.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.318
That could be
a diabetes-related problem.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.737
I'd like to run some tests.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.990
No tests and no X-rays.

10:16.991 --> 10:21.995
Well, I see and hear
that you smoke.

10:22.038 --> 10:25.915
My guess is you're in the early
stages of emphysema.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.710
And Alvin,
you have circulation problems

10:28.711 --> 10:31.796
and I'm worried
about your diet.

10:31.797 --> 10:35.717
If you don't
make some changes quickly,

10:35.718 --> 10:38.178
there will be
some serious consequences.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.314
It... has a... a red roof.

11:31.315 --> 11:34.109
Another pretty one, Rose.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.487
I want to... uh,
paint the... uh, next one blue.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.114
That's a good idea.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.333
What... uh, did the doctor say?

11:53.462 --> 11:57.173
He said
I was gonna live to be 100.

12:33.085 --> 12:36.421
I think I'll go
and mow the lawn.

12:36.422 --> 12:39.674
Uh, I can... uh,
cut it for you, Dad.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.301
I got it, sweetheart.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.604
(Tries ignition again)

13:17.171 --> 13:18.922
God darn!

13:39.318 --> 13:42.111
No, we'll...
we won't be mowin' today.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.990
Storm's comin' in.

13:47.076 --> 13:48.785
Yeah.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.411
(Thunderclap)

13:58.629 --> 14:00.547
I love a lightnin' storm.

14:00.548 --> 14:02.215
Uh, me too, Dad.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.094
(Phone)

14:25.114 --> 14:26.531
(Rose) Hello?

14:28.158 --> 14:30.660
This is... is Rose.

14:31.787 --> 14:35.123
Yeah... Yeah... Uh-huh.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.917
Oh, no...

14:39.086 --> 14:40.587
When?

14:42.256 --> 14:45.133
OK... right... right...

14:45.134 --> 14:47.093
I'll tell him.

14:47.094 --> 14:50.513
Yeah... OK... Bye.

14:59.398 --> 15:02.191
Uh, that was... Bobby.

15:03.319 --> 15:06.738
Uncle Lyle... had a...

15:06.739 --> 15:08.072
...a stroke.

15:08.073 --> 15:10.074
(Severe thunderclap)

15:15.831 --> 15:17.457
Dad?

15:44.234 --> 15:46.903
No, Bobby,
he... he didn't say much.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.196
Uh, they've both...

15:48.197 --> 15:49.489
uh, been so...

15:49.490 --> 15:50.907
uh, stubborn.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.411
No, no,
it was longer, I remember.

15:55.412 --> 15:59.749
It was... uh, July, uh, 7th,
19... 88, uh, Bobby.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.045
I always... remember the dates.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.257
Yeah.

16:11.845 --> 16:14.514
I don't know... uh,
what he'll do.

17:19.788 --> 17:21.622
(Alvin) Rose, darlin'?

17:24.501 --> 17:26.169
Rose?

17:26.170 --> 17:29.589
I'm gonna go back on the road.

17:29.590 --> 17:31.632
I've gotta go see Lyle.

17:34.678 --> 17:35.928
But, Dad...

17:38.182 --> 17:39.891
How are you?

17:42.978 --> 17:46.022
Well, I... haven't quite
got that figured yet.

18:02.706 --> 18:05.208
One, your eyes are bad.

18:05.209 --> 18:08.294
That's why you don't...
uh, drive your car.

18:08.295 --> 18:12.340
Uh, two, Uncle Lyle...
uh, lives in... uh, Wisconsin,

18:12.341 --> 18:16.010
which is... uh, 317 miles away.

18:16.011 --> 18:20.223
You would have to... uh,
stay all night... in Des Moines.

18:20.224 --> 18:24.310
Then there's no...
uh, bus... to Zion.

18:24.311 --> 18:27.814
Three, your... uh, hips are bad.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.191
You can hardly... uh, stand...

18:30.192 --> 18:34.237
for two minutes... And
when you... uh, do stand up...

18:34.238 --> 18:37.865
this... is the sound you make...

18:37.866 --> 18:40.785
when you... stand.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.870
(Moans)

18:48.669 --> 18:53.214
Uh, four, uh,
you are... uh, 73 years old...

18:53.215 --> 18:54.882
You were... uh, born

18:54.883 --> 18:59.887
when, uh, Calvin... uh, Coolidge
was president... of America.

19:01.932 --> 19:06.185
Uh, you are...
uh, 73 years old, Dad.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.771
And... I cannot drive you there.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.859
Rose, darlin', I'm not dead yet.

19:17.906 --> 19:20.783
Uh, what are we...
uh, building, Dad?

19:23.078 --> 19:24.871
Havin' a party?

19:24.872 --> 19:26.998
Oh, jeez...
I love... uh, parties.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.960
Oh, me too.

19:30.961 --> 19:32.753
And so... where's it at?

19:32.754 --> 19:34.297
Where's what at?

19:34.298 --> 19:37.425
Your... uh, party.

19:39.636 --> 19:42.054
I'm not havin' a party.

19:42.055 --> 19:45.266
I thought
YOU were havin' a party.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.851
I am?

19:46.852 --> 19:50.188
Well, yeah.
Look at all that Braunschweiger.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.024
Oh, yeah,
it's a lot of Braunschweiger.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.068
It's... uh, for my dad,
uh, for his... his trip.

19:56.069 --> 19:58.779
Uh, my dad...
he's going to... uh, Wisconsin.

19:58.780 --> 20:02.491
I... asked him how
he's... uh, going to get there...

20:02.492 --> 20:05.286
Uh... but he...
uh, won't say nothing.

20:05.287 --> 20:09.457
Wisconsin?
That is a real party state.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.875
Yeah.

20:12.502 --> 20:15.588
I... uh, hate...
uh, Braun... uh... schweiger.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.218
Yeah.

20:45.577 --> 20:49.372
Alvin, you've got three
five-gallon cans there.

20:51.625 --> 20:54.210
15 gallons of gas.

20:54.211 --> 20:57.755
What do you need
so much gas for, Alvin?

20:57.756 --> 21:01.342
Sig, you're one nosey
son of a gun.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.095
(Man sniggers)
You got that right.

21:04.096 --> 21:07.765
- I wanna buy that.
- What?

21:07.766 --> 21:09.308
The grabber.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.608
Oh, jeez, Alvin.

21:17.609 --> 21:21.279
- That's MY grabber, Alvin.
- Well?

21:25.575 --> 21:30.579
Oh, jeez, Alvin. I don't...
I... I do have two of them...

21:31.707 --> 21:34.166
I think five dollars is right.

21:34.167 --> 21:38.713
That's a darn good grabber,
Alvin.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.423
- I... I...
- Well?

21:40.424 --> 21:42.925
They're hard to come by, Alvin.

21:42.926 --> 21:47.805
It's gonna take me two months
to get another one on order.

21:56.189 --> 21:59.400
Jeez, Alvin, ten dollars.

21:59.401 --> 22:01.152
Ring her up.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.881
(Sighs)

22:36.772 --> 22:40.066
What do you need
that grabber for, Alvin?

22:41.026 --> 22:42.276
Grabbin'.

23:15.685 --> 23:17.269
(Motor starts)

23:36.123 --> 23:41.710
Oh, jeez, Dad.

23:44.673 --> 23:46.090
(Rumbling)

23:58.854 --> 24:01.313
Listen to that
old grain elevator.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.861
It's... uh, harvest time.

24:17.497 --> 24:21.917
Uh, that... uh, trailer is too
h-heavy for... for that.

24:21.918 --> 24:25.296
It's a lawn mower.
You're going to...

24:25.297 --> 24:29.008
...drive a... a lawn mower
to another state?

24:34.097 --> 24:36.974
Rosie, I've...
I've gotta go see Lyle.

24:38.477 --> 24:42.771
And I... I've gotta make
this trip on my own.

24:42.772 --> 24:45.483
I know you understand.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.573
I guess so.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.962
Look up at the sky, Rosie.

25:19.476 --> 25:23.145
The sky is sure full
of stars tonight.

25:44.459 --> 25:48.128
Crimenetto, it's Alvin
and he's driving his lawn mower.

25:56.346 --> 26:00.766
Alvin! What are you settin' out
to do here?

26:00.767 --> 26:02.351
For cry eye, Alvin!

26:02.352 --> 26:05.813
Alvin, you're gonna get blown
right off the road,

26:05.814 --> 26:07.398
that's what I'm afraid!

26:17.617 --> 26:20.494
He'll never make it
past The Grotto.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.044
(Truck horn)

29:26.222 --> 29:27.473
(Crickets)

30:35.667 --> 30:37.251
(Ignition turns over)

30:40.171 --> 30:42.714
(Turns over a second time)

30:45.885 --> 30:47.928
(Turns over again and dies)

30:57.230 --> 30:58.856
(Vehicle approaching)

31:21.963 --> 31:24.464
I'm havin'
a little engine trouble.

31:24.465 --> 31:27.759
What the heck is that
you're driving there?

31:27.760 --> 31:32.723
It's a Rehds. Could you
give me a lift into town?

31:32.724 --> 31:37.519
Yeah, to The Grotto. This
is the Sun Ray Tour. Get in.

31:37.520 --> 31:42.065
- I'll get you help there.
- I'd appreciate that.

31:44.485 --> 31:46.528
(Chattering from bus)

32:01.711 --> 32:04.171
My Edward loved
his riding mower.

32:37.830 --> 32:40.415
Hey, come here, hurry. Hurry up.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.140
Poor Alvin.

33:06.109 --> 33:11.071
So the man... in a... pick-up,
he brought my dad back.

33:11.072 --> 33:15.409
Ohh... mm, I must've been
at the beauty shop.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.330
What kinda pick-up?

33:34.554 --> 33:36.179
(Door creaks)

33:39.517 --> 33:41.143
A Ford.

33:43.021 --> 33:46.231
But what's your dad doin'
with that gun?

33:46.232 --> 33:47.983
I don't know.

33:51.320 --> 33:52.696
(Fires)

33:54.323 --> 33:55.532
(Fires again)

33:56.951 --> 34:00.412
I gave you that old Rehds
last time, right?

34:00.413 --> 34:02.122
That you did.

34:02.123 --> 34:07.127
- You tradin' in that Rehds now?
- No, I don't believe I will.

34:07.754 --> 34:12.466
Pete told me you used that rider
in a real interestin' way.

34:12.467 --> 34:16.344
- You still plannin' to do that?
- Yeah, Tom.

34:16.344 --> 34:21.349
I know not to talk you out of
somethin' you set your mind to,

34:21.976 --> 34:25.478
but Alvin, you've always
struck me as smart.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.563
Well, that's appreciated.

34:27.565 --> 34:29.274
Until now.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.484
(Both laugh)

34:36.574 --> 34:37.824
(Alvin) What year?

34:37.824 --> 34:39.159
(Salesman) '66.

34:39.159 --> 34:42.454
Kohler engine.
We've used it for parts

34:42.455 --> 34:45.916
but I always replace them.
The guts are good.

34:45.917 --> 34:49.835
It's got the old transmission.
Nothing fancy.

34:49.837 --> 34:53.297
- Is it a good machine?
- It's good.

34:53.299 --> 34:56.802
Tom, I got $325.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.470
That's a fact.

34:58.471 --> 35:02.933
Sounds good to me, Alvin.
Let's go settle up with Alice.

35:02.934 --> 35:06.061
One more thing,
sometime you can find out

35:06.062 --> 35:09.940
about these old machines,
if you know who run 'em.

35:09.941 --> 35:14.277
- Do you know who owned it?
- You bet... Me.

35:14.278 --> 35:15.487
All right.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.138
(Fire roaring
and crickets rattling)

37:39.548 --> 37:40.966
(Honks horn)

38:21.924 --> 38:23.133
(Crickets)

38:27.471 --> 38:28.888
(Fire crackling)

38:45.948 --> 38:48.408
I couldn't get a ride.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.166
Are you hungry?

38:56.167 --> 38:59.336
Whaddaya got?

38:59.337 --> 39:01.004
Weeners.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.091
Weeners?

39:05.092 --> 39:07.927
Weeners. Wanna try one?

39:26.030 --> 39:28.615
Here's a good stick for you.

40:06.654 --> 40:08.696
What a hunk ofjunk.

40:08.697 --> 40:11.241
Eat your dinner, missy.

41:05.045 --> 41:09.841
So... how long you been
out on the road?

41:09.842 --> 41:14.512
Well, I been travellin'
most of my life.

41:14.513 --> 41:16.764
Where you from?

41:18.058 --> 41:19.476
Laurens.

41:22.396 --> 41:26.107
Got a wife back there? Kids?

41:27.818 --> 41:32.822
My wife, Francis delivered
14 babies. Seven of 'em made it.

41:33.199 --> 41:36.242
My daughter,
Rose lives with me.

41:39.622 --> 41:42.248
Francis died in '81.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.509
Where's your family?

41:57.097 --> 41:58.932
Are you runnin' away?

42:01.101 --> 42:02.393
(Sighs softly)

42:08.359 --> 42:10.401
How far along are ya?

42:15.074 --> 42:16.866
Five months.

42:20.454 --> 42:22.247
(Owl hoots)

42:31.340 --> 42:34.634
Well, I'm headin'
to see my brother Lyle.

42:37.638 --> 42:39.180
Huh?

42:39.181 --> 42:43.977
I said I'm goin' to see
my brother Lyle in Mount Zion.

42:45.688 --> 42:48.690
- Where's that?
- Wisconsin.

42:48.691 --> 42:52.068
- Oh...
- Just across the state line.

42:52.069 --> 42:53.319
Cheddar Heads.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.571
(Both chuckle)

42:54.572 --> 42:56.614
Aren't those the dumbest things

42:56.615 --> 43:00.076
you ever seen somebody
stick on their head?

43:00.077 --> 43:04.205
I hear that's
a real party place - Wisconsin.

43:09.128 --> 43:12.046
Guess I'll never
get to find out.

43:19.179 --> 43:22.098
There's a blanket
in the trailer.

43:22.099 --> 43:24.976
Why don't you go get it?

44:11.607 --> 44:13.733
My family hates me.

44:18.364 --> 44:21.824
They'll really hate me
when they find out.

44:25.079 --> 44:27.205
You didn't tell 'em?

44:27.206 --> 44:30.500
No. No one knows.
Not even my boyfriend.

44:40.302 --> 44:43.054
Well, they may be mad,

44:43.055 --> 44:47.433
but I don't think they're
mad enough to wanna lose you

44:47.434 --> 44:50.311
or your little problem.

44:50.312 --> 44:52.563
I don't know about that.

44:52.564 --> 44:57.568
Well, of course, neither do I,
but a warm bed and a roof

44:57.736 --> 45:02.448
sounds a might better
than eatin' a hot dog on a stick

45:02.449 --> 45:06.202
with an old geezer that's
travellin' on a lawn mower.

45:15.003 --> 45:17.630
My daughter Rose is...

45:17.631 --> 45:22.051
Some people call her
a little bit slow but she's not.

45:22.052 --> 45:26.806
She's got a mind
like a bear trap for facts.

45:28.642 --> 45:33.479
She keeps everything
organised around the house.

45:33.480 --> 45:36.023
She was a real good mom.

45:36.024 --> 45:39.026
She had four kids.

45:39.027 --> 45:44.031
One night, somebody else
was watchin' the kids

45:44.408 --> 45:47.869
and there was a fire.

45:47.870 --> 45:52.165
Her second boy
got burned real bad.

45:52.166 --> 45:55.710
Rose had nothin'
to do with it but, ah...

45:55.711 --> 45:59.672
...on account of the way Rose is,
the State figured

45:59.673 --> 46:03.176
she wasn't competent
to take care of them kids

46:03.177 --> 46:06.512
and they took 'em all
away from her.

46:06.513 --> 46:11.851
There isn't a day goes by that
she don't pine for them kids.

46:25.699 --> 46:27.116
(Fire crackling)

46:29.870 --> 46:34.874
When my kids were real little,
I used to play a game with 'em.

46:35.793 --> 46:39.337
I'd give each one
of 'em a stick and -

46:39.338 --> 46:44.133
one for each one of 'em -
then I'd say "you break that."

46:44.134 --> 46:46.677
'Course they could, real easy.

46:46.678 --> 46:51.682
Then I'd say "tie them sticks in
a bundle and try to break that".

46:52.392 --> 46:57.396
'Course they couldn't.
Then I'd say "that bundle...

46:58.482 --> 46:59.899
...that's family."

47:16.583 --> 47:19.335
Why don't you sleep
in the trailer?

47:19.336 --> 47:23.923
This chair's just fine
for me tonight.

47:23.924 --> 47:28.052
No, I'll be fine
sleepin' out here.

47:28.053 --> 47:31.347
Lookin' at the stars
helps me think.

47:33.559 --> 47:34.976
Well...

47:53.620 --> 47:54.871
Thank you.

48:13.599 --> 48:15.016
(Birds)

49:22.542 --> 49:23.960
(Hum of lawn mower)

50:03.625 --> 50:05.042
(Distant thunder)

50:10.132 --> 50:11.549
(Big thunderclap)

50:52.841 --> 50:54.091
Woo!

53:13.773 --> 53:15.065
What the?

53:18.904 --> 53:20.196
What the hell?

53:49.726 --> 53:52.144
Hey, how're you doin'?

53:52.145 --> 53:53.395
Doin' good.

54:19.965 --> 54:21.257
(Hum of lawn mower)

54:21.258 --> 54:21.423
(Cheers and applause)

54:37.607 --> 54:39.108
Hey, Irene.

54:39.109 --> 54:43.654
You don't think about
gettin' old when you're young.

54:43.655 --> 54:45.281
You shouldn't.

54:54.582 --> 54:57.459
Must be something good
about gettin' old.

54:57.460 --> 55:02.464
Well, I can't imagine anything
good about being blind and lame

55:03.967 --> 55:06.260
at the same time, but... still

55:06.261 --> 55:11.265
at my age, I've seen about all
that life has to dish out.

55:12.058 --> 55:15.227
I know to separate the wheat

55:15.228 --> 55:20.316
from the chaff and let
the small stuff fall away.

55:23.737 --> 55:25.362
Let's go, man.

55:27.782 --> 55:31.535
So, ah... what's the worst part
about being old, Alvin?

55:33.830 --> 55:39.543
The worst part of being old is
rememberin' when you was young.

55:45.884 --> 55:47.926
(Hum of lawn mower)

55:54.225 --> 55:56.060
(Roar of big engines)

56:40.063 --> 56:41.772
(Hum of lawn mower)

56:57.455 --> 56:59.123
(Car horn)

56:59.124 --> 57:00.541
(Car skids)

57:00.542 --> 57:01.959
(Crash)

57:07.590 --> 57:09.007
(Motor dies)

57:10.301 --> 57:11.552
(Wind whistles)

57:39.414 --> 57:41.498
Can I help you, lady?

57:41.499 --> 57:45.794
No, you can't help me.
No one can help me.

57:45.795 --> 57:50.257
I've tried driving with my
lights on, sounding my horn!

57:50.258 --> 57:55.262
I scream, I roll the window down
and bang on the door

57:55.263 --> 57:58.557
and play Public Enemy real loud!

57:58.558 --> 58:02.519
I've prayed to St Francis
of Assisi, St Christopher too!

58:02.520 --> 58:06.565
What the heck! I've tried
everything and still every week

58:06.566 --> 58:08.984
I hit at least one deer!

58:08.985 --> 58:13.989
I have hit 13 deer in seven
weeks driving down this road!

58:15.241 --> 58:20.245
And I HAVE to drive
down this road every day,

58:20.747 --> 58:23.248
40 miles to work and back.

58:23.249 --> 58:29.421
I HAVE to drive to work
and I HAVE to drive home!

58:33.510 --> 58:35.552
Where do they come from?

58:48.233 --> 58:49.483
Oh... he's dead.

58:54.405 --> 58:56.406
And I LOVE deer.

59:04.666 --> 59:06.291
(Car screams away)

01:01:08.331 --> 01:01:13.335
Well, they sure picked the right
place to practise a burn on.

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:16.838
(Hums "Taps")

01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:30.894
(Man) That Rumelthanger place
was an eyesore.

01:01:50.415 --> 01:01:51.832
(Motor clicks)

01:01:54.001 --> 01:01:55.252
(Chugging)

01:01:59.632 --> 01:02:01.258
(Bigger click)

01:02:15.773 --> 01:02:18.233
What do you suppose?

01:02:18.234 --> 01:02:20.444
(Woman) Is that a lawn mower?

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.406
(Thundering motor)

01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:51.850
(Breathes deeply)

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:53.894
(Man) Mister, you OK?

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:04.863
Jeez, mister, you're lucky
she didn't roll on you.

01:03:12.330 --> 01:03:14.414
I guess the belt broke.

01:03:14.415 --> 01:03:16.750
(Man) I wouldn't be surprised.

01:03:16.751 --> 01:03:20.086
You don't have brakes
on that trailer, right?

01:03:20.087 --> 01:03:23.173
I worked for John Deere
for 30 years,

01:03:23.174 --> 01:03:27.093
you shouldn't be hauling a rig
behind a mower.

01:03:27.094 --> 01:03:30.222
At least not down
a hill like that.

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:33.058
I'm Danny Riordan.

01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:35.811
Alvin Straight.

01:03:35.812 --> 01:03:40.398
Alvin, let's get you
and this rig off the road

01:03:40.399 --> 01:03:43.276
and see what the damage is.

01:03:55.706 --> 01:03:58.166
Let's get this off the road.

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:01.920
Sure you're OK?

01:04:30.616 --> 01:04:31.825
(Birds)

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:41.251
OK.

01:04:41.252 --> 01:04:45.672
You OK? Everything all right?
I'm going back to the exercise.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:47.841
Thanks. Appreciate it.

01:04:51.429 --> 01:04:54.014
(Sighs)

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:57.392
Well... let's
take a look at this mower.

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:03.273
- This is what '65, '66?
- '66.

01:05:09.655 --> 01:05:12.616
Well... tell you right now,
Alvin,

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:15.160
you won't be going
anywhere tonight.

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:18.371
Aside from your, ah,
drive belt being busted,

01:05:18.372 --> 01:05:20.957
you got transmission problems.

01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:24.336
- Where you headed?
- Mount Zion.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:27.464
Mount Zion, Wisconsin?
Past Prairie du Chien?

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:29.925
That's 60 more miles of hills.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:31.843
That's across the Mississippi.

01:05:31.844 --> 01:05:34.304
(Danny)
What's in Mount Zion, Alvin?

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:36.097
My brother lives there.

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:40.518
- Why didn't you take your car?
- I'm not licensed.

01:05:40.519 --> 01:05:44.731
- (Woman) Couldn't he visit?
- He's had a bad stroke.

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:48.026
Where are you coming from?

01:05:48.027 --> 01:05:49.903
Back a piece.

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:52.280
(Danny) West Union?

01:05:52.281 --> 01:05:54.115
- Hawkeye?
- Nope.

01:05:55.868 --> 01:06:00.080
Well, not New Hampton?
You haven't come that far.

01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:03.333
You've come a long ways,
haven't you?

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:06.503
Yeah, I have. Laurens, Iowa.

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:08.213
(Woman) Laurens?!

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:13.218
That's west of The Grotto. How
long have you been on the road?

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:14.719
What's the date?

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.137
October eighth.

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:24.729
Five weeks. I left Laurens
on the fifth of September.

01:06:24.730 --> 01:06:28.191
You been bunkin' in that?

01:06:28.192 --> 01:06:31.069
That's my rollin' home.

01:06:31.070 --> 01:06:33.238
Where you been settin' up camp?

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:37.909
In the fields. I pull off.
I don't travel at night.

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:40.370
Haven't you been scared,
being alone?

01:06:40.371 --> 01:06:42.372
There are weird people
everywhere.

01:06:42.373 --> 01:06:47.377
Well, ma'am, I fought
in the trenches in World War II.

01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:51.506
Why should I be scared
of an Iowa cornfield?

01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:54.801
Well, um...

01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:57.137
till we get
this mower fixed...

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:02.475
why don't you... ah,
bivouac in our yard here?

01:07:02.476 --> 01:07:05.937
There's a bathroom
in the garage you can use.

01:07:05.938 --> 01:07:08.523
Well, that's
awful generous of you

01:07:08.524 --> 01:07:12.944
and I'm sure my machine here
is agreeable to that too.

01:07:15.781 --> 01:07:19.617
Sure wanna thank you folks
for helping me today.

01:07:19.618 --> 01:07:22.120
There's a lot of rain forecast.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:25.790
Sure don't want to get stuck
in that trailer.

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:30.420
I... I do a little woodwork.
I thought you'd like a few fish.

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:33.548
My daughter does woodwork.
She makes birdhouses.

01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:35.175
(Both) Oh, that's nice.

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:45.435
- You finished there?
- I believe I am.

01:08:28.645 --> 01:08:29.895
(Fly buzzing)

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:18.862
- I'm in need of a phone.
- Sure. Come in.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:22.823
I wanna tell my daughter
about my recent travels.

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.492
Sure. Come in.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:29.497
If it's all the same with you,
do you have a cordless phone?

01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:34.544
- Door's wide open, come...
- I can call from out here.

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:48.099
Here you go. You're welcome
to sit in the kitchen.

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:51.560
We can leave, if you're
lookin' for privacy.

01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:56.399
Out here's fine.
Is the area code still 712 here?

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.652
No, Alvin.
That hill rolled you into 319.

01:09:59.653 --> 01:10:03.364
You need to dial one
and your area code.

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:04.782
712, thank you.

01:10:20.966 --> 01:10:22.217
'Hello? '

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:23.509
Rose?

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:24.928
Dad? Dad...

01:10:27.848 --> 01:10:30.225
Uh, I'm... so glad to hear you.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:41.736
It's gonna cost him a bundle
to fix that mower.

01:10:41.737 --> 01:10:45.448
I don't think
he's got that kinda money.

01:10:45.449 --> 01:10:48.368
I wouldn't drive
that thing to Excelsior.

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:51.204
It's a lawn mower,
for God's sake.

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:56.042
Uh, your social security cheque?
Ah... it's here, Dad.

01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:58.920
Rose, can you send me my cheque?

01:10:58.921 --> 01:11:01.172
Uh, yeah.

01:11:01.173 --> 01:11:04.884
He's damn lucky
he made it down that hill.

01:11:04.885 --> 01:11:08.429
- He could've died easily.
- Yeah.

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:10.473
He's none too strong.

01:11:10.474 --> 01:11:14.143
See how he has to walk
with the canes?

01:11:14.144 --> 01:11:16.354
OK, Dad.

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:18.856
(Chuckles)

01:11:21.193 --> 01:11:23.611
I... I...

01:11:26.156 --> 01:11:30.952
OK, OK, Dad, OK.
I... I have a pencil, Dad.

01:11:30.953 --> 01:11:33.746
The hills just get worse

01:11:33.747 --> 01:11:36.624
the closer you get
to the Mississippi.

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:41.462
Go ahead and drive him, honey.

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:45.216
Mount Zion can't
be half a day. It's fine.

01:11:45.217 --> 01:11:48.469
You're a good man,
Danny Riordan.

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:53.016
And that's why I married you,
despite what my mother said.

01:11:55.060 --> 01:11:56.311
Now, shoo!

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:57.562
Dad?

01:11:57.563 --> 01:11:59.355
I miss you, Dad.

01:12:00.649 --> 01:12:02.442
I love you, Rosie.

01:12:02.443 --> 01:12:04.527
'I love you too, Dad.'

01:12:04.528 --> 01:12:06.195
Uh, bye, Dad.

01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:09.615
Bye... Dad.

01:12:09.616 --> 01:12:10.825
(Tone)

01:12:12.911 --> 01:12:14.162
Ahem.

01:12:36.143 --> 01:12:37.560
(Door creaks)

01:12:40.314 --> 01:12:41.522
(Footsteps)

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:45.151
What are you cookin'
there, Alvin?

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:47.695
Oh, I'm makin'
my Mexican coffee.

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:50.281
Ah. Mind if I join you?

01:12:50.282 --> 01:12:53.576
Get you a chair...
that iron one there.

01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:59.916
You'll be a guest
in your own back yard.

01:13:02.419 --> 01:13:06.547
Amm, I talked to the Olsen
twins, and, ah... they estimate

01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:13.388
it'll cost around 250 dollars
to get your mower fixed.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:16.557
Well, that's twice
what it oughta be,

01:13:16.558 --> 01:13:19.477
I guess it's cos
they're twins, huh?

01:13:19.478 --> 01:13:21.145
(Both laugh)

01:13:21.146 --> 01:13:26.150
I'd be happy to drive you the
rest of the way to Mount Zion.

01:13:26.944 --> 01:13:31.364
Be a nice Sunday drive.
We enjoy crossin' the river,

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:34.033
especially now
with the trees in colour.

01:13:34.034 --> 01:13:36.702
Well, I appreciate that, but...

01:13:36.703 --> 01:13:39.997
...I wanna finish this one
my own way.

01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:53.302
Try this.

01:13:58.225 --> 01:13:59.434
Thank you.

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:04.939
Well, you know, Alvin,
there's a lotta hills

01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:07.775
bigger than Clairmont's
between here and Zion.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:10.945
Even if you get that mower
runnin' again,

01:14:10.946 --> 01:14:13.197
it may still break down.

01:14:13.198 --> 01:14:17.743
Well, you're a kind man
talkin' to a stubborn man.

01:14:17.744 --> 01:14:21.122
I still wanna finish this
the way I started.

01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:26.669
No, no...

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:29.046
Hi, Verlyn.

01:14:29.047 --> 01:14:32.300
- How the heck you doin'?
- Fine.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.676
Wonderful.

01:14:33.677 --> 01:14:35.094
He's there.

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:51.277
Well... they gave you
a plate of her brownies.

01:14:51.278 --> 01:14:53.196
(Laughs) Yeah.

01:14:53.197 --> 01:14:54.947
How's that for timing?

01:14:54.948 --> 01:14:57.033
Janet makes the best brownies...

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:58.868
(Both) in Lafayette county.

01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:02.622
She won prizes every year
at the county fair.

01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:05.166
- Mmm... help yourself.
- Thank you.

01:15:09.713 --> 01:15:13.758
Mmm... I've been doin' errands
and I'm heading for a beer.

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:16.552
I thought you'd like
to join me.

01:15:16.553 --> 01:15:18.888
Well, I don't drink
any more, but...

01:15:18.889 --> 01:15:22.099
I'm always up for a change
of scenery.

01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:23.351
Well, come on.

01:15:31.818 --> 01:15:35.613
Well, I'm ridin' a little higher
and a little faster.

01:15:35.614 --> 01:15:38.741
Except when you came down
that hill.

01:15:38.742 --> 01:15:40.576
(Both laugh)

01:15:47.459 --> 01:15:51.629
I picked up a mournful taste
for liquor in France.

01:15:51.630 --> 01:15:55.466
When I came back,
I couldn't drink enough of it.

01:15:55.467 --> 01:16:00.596
I wasn't worth a stick
of stove wood... I was mean.

01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:06.435
A preacher helped me
put some distance

01:16:06.436 --> 01:16:10.815
between me and the bottle.
And he helped me see...

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:15.653
the reason I was drinkin', I was
seein' all them things here,

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:17.738
that I'd seen over there.

01:16:23.453 --> 01:16:28.457
â™ª Though things may look very
dark, your dream is not... â™ª

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:31.335
Lots of men came back
drinkin' hard.

01:16:34.089 --> 01:16:37.383
Well... everyone
tryin' to forget.

01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:42.263
I can see it
in a man right away.

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:47.268
Yup.

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:49.312
â™ª The rainbow,
you will suddenly... â™ª

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:06.203
There was one time...

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:10.166
when we just...

01:17:12.002 --> 01:17:16.422
Were waiting for
the first warm meal in ten days.

01:17:23.513 --> 01:17:25.848
We... thought
we'd seen the worst.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:32.104
We hadn't had
much trouble from the air.

01:17:35.567 --> 01:17:37.943
I was on the rise...

01:17:37.944 --> 01:17:39.945
with the quartermaster,

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:45.076
workin' on more coffee
for me and my buddies.

01:17:47.329 --> 01:17:50.373
(Sobbing) A stray Fokker
came over the treetops...

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:55.461
and dropped
an incendiary on the mess tent.

01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:56.962
(Sounds of war)

01:17:56.963 --> 01:17:58.589
All my buddies...

01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:05.012
The Kraut banked right in front
of me on that hill...

01:18:06.973 --> 01:18:10.059
and now I can...
see the... Swastika.

01:18:23.824 --> 01:18:27.618
That is one thing
that I can't shake loose...

01:18:27.619 --> 01:18:30.705
All my buddies faces
are still young.

01:18:33.542 --> 01:18:38.546
And the thing is, the more years
I have, the more they've lost.

01:18:39.297 --> 01:18:40.798
(Sobbing quietly)

01:18:40.799 --> 01:18:44.468
And it's not always buddies
faces that I see,

01:18:44.469 --> 01:18:46.429
sometime they're German faces.

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:53.978
Near the end we were shootin'
moon-faced boys.

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:02.153
I was a sniper.

01:19:02.154 --> 01:19:06.991
Where I grew up, you learned
how to shoot to hunt food.

01:19:06.992 --> 01:19:12.329
They'd post me up front.
Darn near ahead of the lines.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.834
And I'd sit... forever.

01:19:18.628 --> 01:19:23.048
It's an amazing thing what you
can see while you're sittin'.

01:19:23.049 --> 01:19:29.263
I'd look for the officers, the
radio guys or artillery spotter.

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:35.561
Sometime I'd spot
a gun nest by the smoke

01:19:37.355 --> 01:19:40.191
and I'd fire into it.

01:19:40.192 --> 01:19:43.986
Sometime it was just
a movement in the woods.

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:51.702
We had a scout,

01:19:53.205 --> 01:19:54.413
a little fella...

01:19:55.874 --> 01:19:57.082
name of Kotz.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:02.421
He was a Polish boy
from Milwaukee.

01:20:05.634 --> 01:20:10.179
He'd always take recon
and he was darn good at it.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:15.643
We went by his word and he saved
our skin many a time.

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:20.189
He was a little fella...

01:20:26.696 --> 01:20:29.156
We'd broken
out of the hedgerows...

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:33.911
We were makin'
a run across the open

01:20:34.996 --> 01:20:37.456
and we come upon a woods.

01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:41.335
We started drawin' fire.

01:20:43.421 --> 01:20:45.422
I took my usual position...

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:51.011
and I saw somethin' movin',
real slow like.

01:20:53.014 --> 01:20:58.602
I waited ten minutes,
it moved again and I shot.

01:21:00.146 --> 01:21:01.981
The movement stopped.

01:21:04.150 --> 01:21:08.821
The next day
we found Kotz... head shot.

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:14.243
He'd been workin'
his way back toward our lines.

01:21:16.246 --> 01:21:20.916
Everyone in the unit thought
a German sniper had taken him...

01:21:23.837 --> 01:21:25.838
Everyone, all these years.

01:21:28.341 --> 01:21:29.967
Everyone but me.

01:22:27.233 --> 01:22:28.442
Ha ha!

01:22:29.194 --> 01:22:31.236
See, Harald... brainiac...

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:38.202
Got the mower assembly free with
this here little old wrench...

01:22:38.203 --> 01:22:40.120
You said it wouldn't work.

01:22:40.121 --> 01:22:43.582
I'd say it worked
pretty good. Wouldn't you?

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:51.924
So help me slide her out.
We can get settled up.

01:23:17.033 --> 01:23:18.701
(Harald snarls)

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:24.123
Uh... I got parts and labour
that add up to $247.80.

01:23:29.045 --> 01:23:33.549
Well, I'd say that's a little
heavy for light work.

01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:35.551
Don't you think?

01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:38.887
I've got an old man's eyes,
but, ah...

01:23:38.888 --> 01:23:41.890
I'm noticin' some new tyre here.

01:23:41.891 --> 01:23:45.436
Well, now... ah,
we got those off a resell,

01:23:45.437 --> 01:23:47.479
but the treads are good!

01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:52.234
Well, friend, are you chargin'
me for good or for new?

01:23:52.235 --> 01:23:55.279
Ahhhh... Thorvald?

01:23:56.823 --> 01:24:00.159
Ahh... we can make
an adjustment there.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:06.248
Well, I think the adjustment
should be about thirty dollars.

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:10.002
Is that what
your pencil's sayin'?

01:24:10.003 --> 01:24:12.046
And, ah... about the labour...

01:24:14.632 --> 01:24:19.553
I appreciate that you boys have
done some real time on this...

01:24:19.554 --> 01:24:23.974
of course, a man's gotta ask
when he's workin' with twins -

01:24:23.975 --> 01:24:25.809
especially a bickerin' pair -

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:29.438
how much workin' was fightin'?

01:24:29.439 --> 01:24:31.482
(Danny) He got that right.

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:33.192
(Both) Shut up, Danny.

01:24:33.193 --> 01:24:37.905
If I was to judge by this joyous
affair I saw today,

01:24:37.906 --> 01:24:42.159
I would calculate maybe 20
per cent taken off the labour.

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.577
Anything else, mister?

01:24:45.789 --> 01:24:50.793
Well, I'm not from these parts,
but where I come from,

01:24:50.877 --> 01:24:55.672
I would say that that was a
little rich for Iowa oil.

01:24:55.673 --> 01:24:58.342
Take the oil, no charge.

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:02.805
Well, that's a splendid offer
and I do appreciate it.

01:25:04.307 --> 01:25:05.682
What's the tally?

01:25:05.683 --> 01:25:08.018
Ah... ahhh...

01:25:15.485 --> 01:25:17.444
Hundred and eighty even?

01:25:17.445 --> 01:25:19.822
Done. (Chuckles)

01:25:19.823 --> 01:25:24.827
Thanks to you boys, I'm gonna
get this rig back on the road.

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:30.457
I've drove it all the way across
Iowa and I'm hopin' it holds on

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:34.628
till I get to Wisconsin.
My brother lives there.

01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:37.756
I haven't seen him
in ten years.

01:25:37.757 --> 01:25:40.551
There's no one
knows your life better

01:25:40.552 --> 01:25:43.345
than a brother
that's near your age.

01:25:43.346 --> 01:25:46.098
He knows who and what you are

01:25:46.099 --> 01:25:49.351
better than anyone on Earth.

01:25:49.352 --> 01:25:53.856
My brother and I said some...
unforgivable things

01:25:53.857 --> 01:25:59.236
the last time we met, but, I'm
tryin' to put that behind me.

01:26:01.447 --> 01:26:05.159
And this trip is a hard
swallow... of my pride,

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:10.289
I just hope I'm not too late.

01:26:19.048 --> 01:26:21.592
A brother's a brother.

01:26:32.979 --> 01:26:34.188
Well...

01:26:35.982 --> 01:26:38.483
Guess I'll be turnin' in.

01:26:38.484 --> 01:26:43.071
I'll, ah... see you in the
morning, then, before you go.

01:26:43.072 --> 01:26:45.115
I'm gonna leave awful early.

01:27:04.969 --> 01:27:09.306
I wanna thank you for your
kindness to a stranger.

01:27:09.307 --> 01:27:13.435
It's been a genuine pleasure
havin' you here, Alvin.

01:27:13.436 --> 01:27:15.312
Write to us, sometime.

01:27:15.313 --> 01:27:16.521
I will.

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:29.409
(Lawn mower starts up)

01:31:28.941 --> 01:31:30.192
(Passing truck)

01:32:04.727 --> 01:32:06.811
I noticed your campfire.

01:32:06.812 --> 01:32:11.650
I brought you some dinner...
Mashed potatoes, meat loaf.

01:32:11.651 --> 01:32:14.861
Well, thank you kindly.
I've had my dinner,

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:18.031
but would you
join me for a while?

01:32:18.032 --> 01:32:19.282
Sure.

01:32:26.582 --> 01:32:27.791
Thank you.

01:32:36.217 --> 01:32:39.177
I hope you don't
mind me trespassin'.

01:32:39.178 --> 01:32:41.513
Oh, no, not at all.

01:32:41.514 --> 01:32:43.098
Made a fine choice.

01:32:43.099 --> 01:32:46.601
You're camped next to
one of the oldest cemeteries

01:32:46.602 --> 01:32:50.605
in the Midwest.
French Catholic trappers.

01:32:50.606 --> 01:32:54.317
- The Marquette party.
- Two of his men.

01:32:56.445 --> 01:32:59.322
I couldn't help but notice

01:32:59.323 --> 01:33:01.825
the rather unusual
mode of transport.

01:33:03.828 --> 01:33:07.956
Well, you're not the first
person to notice that, Padre.

01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:13.003
My eyes are bad. I can't drive.

01:33:13.004 --> 01:33:16.089
I don't like someone else
drivin' the bus,

01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:19.092
and I need to get
to my brother's.

01:33:19.093 --> 01:33:20.343
Fair enough.

01:33:20.344 --> 01:33:22.053
Where is he?

01:33:22.054 --> 01:33:25.849
Well, he's so close,
I can practically feel him.

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:27.267
Mount Zion.

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:28.935
What's his name?

01:33:28.936 --> 01:33:31.771
Lyle Straight.

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:36.776
Is he that fella that came in
with a stroke some weeks ago?

01:33:38.946 --> 01:33:40.572
Do you know him?

01:33:40.573 --> 01:33:43.700
I work at the hospital
in Boscobel.

01:33:43.701 --> 01:33:45.785
I remember him comin' in.

01:33:45.786 --> 01:33:49.039
Caught my attention
because... he lives in my parish.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.582
Well, he's a Baptist.

01:33:50.583 --> 01:33:53.460
Oh, I believe he told me that.

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:58.131
Told me a few things,
matter of fact,

01:33:58.132 --> 01:34:01.051
but he didn't
mention having a brother.

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:07.724
Well, neither one of us has had
a brother for quite some time.

01:34:11.771 --> 01:34:15.231
So, you saw him?
Is he all right?

01:34:15.232 --> 01:34:20.612
I only saw him that once and
I haven't heard anything more.

01:34:33.334 --> 01:34:38.338
Well, Lyle and I grew up
as close as brothers could be.

01:34:38.756 --> 01:34:43.468
We were raised on a farm
in Moorhead, Minnesota.

01:34:43.469 --> 01:34:48.473
We worked hard. My mom and dad
darn near killed themselves

01:34:48.933 --> 01:34:52.185
tryin' to make that farm work.

01:34:52.186 --> 01:34:56.731
And me and Lyle would
make games out of our chores.

01:34:58.442 --> 01:35:02.487
We'd dream up somethin'
about racin' and wagerin'

01:35:02.488 --> 01:35:06.366
do anything to keep
our mind off the cold.

01:35:06.367 --> 01:35:07.992
Lord, it was cold.

01:35:07.993 --> 01:35:12.789
He and I used
to sleep out in the yard

01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:16.000
every summer night,
if it wasn't pourin'.

01:35:16.001 --> 01:35:20.422
Nine months of winter,
we couldn't get enough summer.

01:35:20.423 --> 01:35:23.758
We'd bunk down
when the sun went down.

01:35:23.759 --> 01:35:28.513
We'd talk to each other
until we went to sleep.

01:35:28.514 --> 01:35:33.017
We'd talk about the stars
and whether there might be

01:35:34.311 --> 01:35:38.231
somebody else like us
out in space,

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:41.317
places we wanted to go and...

01:35:41.318 --> 01:35:44.237
it made
our trials seem smaller.

01:35:46.323 --> 01:35:50.452
Yeah, we pretty much talked
each other through growin' up.

01:35:55.291 --> 01:36:00.628
Oh, whatever happened
between you two?

01:36:01.964 --> 01:36:05.884
Story as old as the Bible.
Cain and Abel.

01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:10.638
Anger, vanity.

01:36:13.893 --> 01:36:17.562
You mix that together
with liquor, and...

01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:22.776
you've got two brothers who
haven't spoken in ten years.

01:36:24.737 --> 01:36:29.741
Well, whatever it was
that made me and Lyle so mad...

01:36:31.076 --> 01:36:33.286
don't matter any more.

01:36:34.580 --> 01:36:36.122
I wanna make peace.

01:36:37.458 --> 01:36:39.334
I wanna sit with him,

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.462
look up at the stars...

01:36:43.756 --> 01:36:45.590
like we used to do...

01:36:46.884 --> 01:36:48.134
so long ago.

01:36:54.809 --> 01:36:56.518
Well, sir...

01:36:56.602 --> 01:36:59.604
I say "Amen" to that.

01:37:06.445 --> 01:37:07.695
(Fire crackles)

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:21.543
(Hum of lawn mower)

01:37:57.371 --> 01:37:58.621
Howdy.

01:38:15.764 --> 01:38:19.642
I haven't had a drink
in a lot of years.

01:38:19.643 --> 01:38:22.353
Now I'm gonna have me a beer.

01:38:22.354 --> 01:38:23.855
What flavour?

01:38:23.856 --> 01:38:26.900
What does
a Miller's Lite taste like?

01:38:37.995 --> 01:38:39.245
There you go.

01:38:44.835 --> 01:38:47.754
- How's it taste?
- It's good.

01:38:47.755 --> 01:38:50.590
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:55.511
It's an interesting rig you got
outside. Get up the hill OK?

01:38:55.512 --> 01:38:59.807
That hill and 200 more
just like it.

01:38:59.808 --> 01:39:01.893
How far did ya come?

01:39:01.894 --> 01:39:04.145
From Iowa.

01:39:04.146 --> 01:39:06.522
I'm headed
for Lyle Straight's place.

01:39:06.523 --> 01:39:10.401
Iowa! My God,
you must be thirsty.

01:39:10.402 --> 01:39:11.653
(Cough)

01:39:13.822 --> 01:39:15.073
(Scraping)

01:39:24.375 --> 01:39:25.625
(Sighs)

01:39:50.609 --> 01:39:51.859
(Scraping)

01:39:56.073 --> 01:39:57.323
Another beer?

01:39:57.324 --> 01:39:59.283
This will do me fine.

01:39:59.284 --> 01:40:02.745
I wonder could you point me
to Lyle's place?

01:40:02.746 --> 01:40:06.290
I haven't seen him
in an awful long time.

01:40:06.291 --> 01:40:10.753
Well, you just... ah,
cross 61 here, on "W",

01:40:10.754 --> 01:40:15.758
Take "W" on down to Weed Road
and then on to Remington Road.

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:19.512
(Barman) On your right
will be Lyle's place.

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:22.265
If he's there that is.

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:28.081
(Motor clicks)

01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:29.499
(Chugs)

01:41:34.296 --> 01:41:35.546
(Squeaks)

01:41:39.051 --> 01:41:40.468
(Motor dies)

01:41:52.648 --> 01:41:53.898
(Motor hissing)

01:42:42.948 --> 01:42:44.198
(Turns off engine)

01:42:44.199 --> 01:42:45.783
How you doin'?

01:42:45.784 --> 01:42:47.034
Not too good.

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:52.999
This thing's just tired.

01:42:58.755 --> 01:43:02.550
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

01:43:02.551 --> 01:43:06.304
Well, I don't know.
It just quit on me.

01:43:06.305 --> 01:43:08.890
Why don't you try her again?

01:43:08.891 --> 01:43:11.601
(Motor turns over and ignites)

01:43:11.602 --> 01:43:14.937
I'm headin'
to Lyle Straight's place.

01:43:14.938 --> 01:43:17.440
(Tractor engine
starts with a roar)

01:45:21.106 --> 01:45:22.940
Lyle!

01:45:27.195 --> 01:45:28.571
Lyle?

01:45:38.415 --> 01:45:39.832
(Lyle) Alvin?

01:46:20.582 --> 01:46:22.625
(Husky voice) Sit down, Alvin.

01:47:13.635 --> 01:47:19.014
Did you ride that thing all
the way out here to see me?

01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:21.767
I did, Lyle.

01:51:49.202 --> 01:51:52.287
