00:27.027 --> 00:29.377
<i>Previously on</i>
Star Trek: Discovery...

00:29.377 --> 00:31.248
This clue
is the most important thing

00:31.248 --> 00:33.076
in the Federation right now.

00:33.076 --> 00:35.600
We have to get the Progenitors'
power and keep it safe.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.515
Remember how scared you were to

00:37.515 --> 00:40.170
be on the bridge when we went to
Halem'no? You did a great job.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.650
In general,
you're really finding your way,

00:41.650 --> 00:43.521
and you shouldn't be afraid
to take on more.

00:43.521 --> 00:44.827
Thanks, Teach.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.437
<i>
I've found a match</i>

00:46.437 --> 00:47.830
<i>for the phrase inscribed
upon the metal card.</i>

00:47.830 --> 00:49.397
Labyrinths of the Mind

00:49.397 --> 00:51.181
<i>is the title
of a Betazoid manuscript,</i>

00:51.181 --> 00:52.835
Has anyone else
ever come looking for this?

00:52.835 --> 00:55.316
Our records show
you are the first.

00:55.316 --> 00:58.449
<i>
Your consciousness has been
transported into a mindscape.</i>

00:58.449 --> 01:00.712
-Book?
- My form was generated
from your subconscious.

01:00.712 --> 01:03.759
- So why do you look like you?
- You tell me.

01:03.759 --> 01:06.327
- We talked earlier and...
- And what?

01:06.327 --> 01:09.112
We didn't fix it. That's why
my subconscious picked you,

01:09.112 --> 01:12.420
because I want to fix it,
but I don't know how.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.857
<i>
There's a crystal
in viewing room seven.</i>

01:14.857 --> 01:17.773
<i>Once you wake up, just go in,
get it, and break it open.</i>

01:17.773 --> 01:19.862
<i>Clue's hidden inside.</i>

01:19.862 --> 01:22.125
There's one more thing
you need to know first,

01:22.125 --> 01:24.562
about something
inside your final destination.

01:25.694 --> 01:27.261
<i>
Give me the clues,</i>

01:27.261 --> 01:29.219
<i>or more blood
will be on your hands.</i>

01:29.219 --> 01:31.047
Stand by for transport.
<i>Discovery</i> out.

01:33.832 --> 01:36.748
Coordinates to
the Progenitors' technology.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.837
Get a scan of that map
to Stamets.

01:38.837 --> 01:41.449
We've received an item
from <i>Discovery</i> via transport.

01:41.449 --> 01:43.364
Materialize it.

01:44.365 --> 01:46.932
- Is the object authentic?
- It is.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.673
- They're locking onto us.
- Evasive maneuvers.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.849
<i>We're gonna vent
and jump simultaneously.</i>

01:53.852 --> 01:57.421
Primarch, we've confirmed debris
and traces of warp plasma.

01:57.421 --> 01:59.380
<i>Discovery</i> has been destroyed.

02:01.817 --> 02:03.210
<i>
Commander Asha, where are we?</i>

02:03.210 --> 02:04.602
<i>
22 light years off-target.</i>

02:04.602 --> 02:06.474
Commander Stamets?

02:06.474 --> 02:07.910
<i>Stamets [over comms]:
The spore drive malfunctioned.</i>

02:07.910 --> 02:09.564
We cannot jump again
until it is fixed.

02:09.564 --> 02:11.696
Would your Scion
be this selfish?

02:11.696 --> 02:14.177
He left for a human.

02:14.177 --> 02:17.354
He loves me, but he left
because of you.

02:19.530 --> 02:21.228
Primarch, don't.

02:25.406 --> 02:27.147
I am the wife of L'ak.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.713
True ruler of the Imperium.

02:28.713 --> 02:31.803
- Long will he reign.
-Long will he reign.

02:31.803 --> 02:34.284
Long will he reign.

02:59.483 --> 03:02.486
My dearest T'Rina,

03:02.486 --> 03:04.271
it is...

03:04.271 --> 03:06.229
good to see you again.

03:06.229 --> 03:08.971
And you, Saru.

03:08.971 --> 03:11.930
I bring these as a gift
from the planet Elpanah.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.237
They believe them
to be good luck for those

03:14.237 --> 03:16.065
with impending nuptials.

03:16.065 --> 03:17.980
They are lovely. Thank you.

03:17.980 --> 03:21.766
If I may, I cannot help but
notice concern in your demeanor.

03:21.766 --> 03:25.596
That and all of the activity...
Is something amiss?

03:29.644 --> 03:33.125
As you were already in transit
from your diplomatic mission,

03:33.125 --> 03:35.476
it was deemed best to wait
to tell you directly.

03:35.476 --> 03:38.261
<i>Discovery</i> came into conflict
with a Breen vessel.

03:38.261 --> 03:40.045
- Oh.
- They have sustained damage,

03:40.045 --> 03:41.395
but no casualties.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.527
- Well, that is a relief.
- That said,

03:43.527 --> 03:45.877
the situation
has become complex.

03:45.877 --> 03:48.532
President Rillak has convened
an emergency meeting.

03:48.532 --> 03:50.273
She requires us both.

03:50.273 --> 03:53.015
Primarch Ruhn is dead.

03:53.015 --> 03:54.582
Moll killed him.

03:54.582 --> 03:57.715
The news has spread faster
than we anticipated.

03:57.715 --> 03:59.935
Within a matter of hours,
the remaining five

03:59.935 --> 04:01.806
Primarchs have become aware.

04:01.806 --> 04:03.721
They smell blood in the water.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.245
I have just returned
from planets

04:05.245 --> 04:07.159
near the border of Breen space.

04:07.159 --> 04:09.510
They are already on edge.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.990
The potential ramifications
of this development

04:11.990 --> 04:13.775
could cause panic.

04:13.775 --> 04:15.211
We'll have to deal with that
another day.

04:15.211 --> 04:18.954
Right now, we have
more immediate concerns.

04:18.954 --> 04:22.479
Our intelligence indicates
that one of the five

04:22.479 --> 04:24.568
Primarchs, Tahal,

04:24.568 --> 04:26.875
intends to take Ruhn's soldiers
for herself

04:26.875 --> 04:29.573
in order to strengthen her bid
for the throne of the Imperium.

04:29.573 --> 04:32.097
She has mobilized her fleet
to pursue his dreadnaught,

04:32.097 --> 04:33.969
which is already on its way
to the location

04:33.969 --> 04:35.797
of the Progenitors' technology.

04:35.797 --> 04:38.408
That is where <i>Discovery</i>
will travel as well,

04:38.408 --> 04:39.931
once damage is repaired.

04:39.931 --> 04:42.238
Yes.

04:42.238 --> 04:44.458
<i>Discovery</i> needs to secure
the technology

04:44.458 --> 04:47.374
and jump away
before Tahal gets there.

04:47.374 --> 04:51.334
If she learns that we're after
the literal power of creation...

04:51.334 --> 04:54.076
well, I think we all know
she won't let that one go.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.513
<i>Discovery</i> barely escaped
one dreadnaught.

04:56.513 --> 04:59.734
Were they to face
Tahal's entire fleet...

04:59.734 --> 05:01.562
Are we able to send
reinforcements?

05:01.562 --> 05:04.652
Admiral Vance is mobilizing
every ship in the sector,

05:04.652 --> 05:07.350
but most won't make it in time.

05:07.350 --> 05:09.047
Excuse me, Madam President.

05:09.047 --> 05:10.875
Moll's dreadnaught just exited
a transwarp tunnel.

05:10.875 --> 05:13.313
They've picked up time.
They'll be at the coordinates

05:13.313 --> 05:16.011
of the Progenitors' technology
in 15 minutes.

05:16.011 --> 05:19.928
Notify <i>Discovery.</i>
They need to get moving now.

05:21.669 --> 05:23.888
<i>SARU [over comms]:
I do wish I had
better news, Captain.</i>

05:23.888 --> 05:26.456
And here I was, hoping
you were calling to say hi.

05:26.456 --> 05:29.503
<i>
I trust you will find a way
to succeed, and I assure you</i>

05:29.503 --> 05:31.635
we will do all we can
to prevent Tahal

05:31.635 --> 05:33.637
and her fleet
from joining the conflict.

05:33.637 --> 05:35.987
I know you will, Saru.
Thank you.

05:35.987 --> 05:38.120
<i>We're almost done with repairs,
and we'll be on our way soon.</i>

05:38.120 --> 05:40.209
Good luck, Michael.

05:40.209 --> 05:42.385
And, please, stay safe.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.865
Damn right I will.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.693
I got a wedding to go to
when this is all over.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.784
Hey, we need to go.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.525
Moll and the Breen are
almost at the coordinates.

05:51.525 --> 05:52.874
Any other good news?

05:52.874 --> 05:55.398
Primarch Tahal
may be coming, too.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.969
Okay.

06:00.969 --> 06:02.971
Well, basic power
and auxiliary systems

06:02.971 --> 06:05.408
are back online.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.497
Lights are a good sign.
What about the other repairs?

06:07.497 --> 06:09.412
Left nacelle's fully functional,

06:09.412 --> 06:11.414
right's almost there.
Shields are in progress.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.590
What about the spore drive?

06:13.590 --> 06:16.158
That's a different story.

06:16.158 --> 06:19.422
Okay, w-we can jump, but I just

06:19.422 --> 06:22.947
can't guarantee that we'll land
precisely where we intend to.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.645
How "not precisely"
are we talking?

06:24.645 --> 06:27.430
Well, nav system was damaged
during Ruhn's attack,

06:27.430 --> 06:29.824
and Book is helping.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.739
Yeah, shouldn't you be
in sickbay?

06:31.739 --> 06:33.610
Culber patched me up.

06:33.610 --> 06:36.134
You know me, couldn't just
sit around relaxing, could I?

06:37.832 --> 06:41.313
Um, we've improved the
margin of error considerably,

06:41.313 --> 06:43.533
but I would feel
much more confident

06:43.533 --> 06:45.013
in our landing accuracy

06:45.013 --> 06:47.624
if we could have another
hour and a half?

06:47.624 --> 06:49.757
Not gonna happen, Commander.

06:49.757 --> 06:51.149
No, we need to jump right now.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.499
Do your best.

06:56.241 --> 06:58.461
- Coordinates are set, Captain.
-Thank you.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.115
How's it looking
out there, Tilly?

07:00.115 --> 07:02.334
Long-range scans are unclear--
I'm not sure why--

07:02.334 --> 07:04.772
but I can tell it's in an area
of gravitational turbulence,

07:04.772 --> 07:06.121
so we'll need to be careful.

07:06.121 --> 07:08.558
<i>Discovery,</i>
this is Captain Burnham.

07:08.558 --> 07:09.994
Everyone to stations.

07:09.994 --> 07:13.258
Prepare to jump,
and expect a hard landing.

07:13.258 --> 07:16.131
The Breen may already
be on site, so eyes up.

07:16.131 --> 07:17.349
Commander Jemison,
get us cloaked.

07:17.349 --> 07:18.873
Aye, Captain.

07:22.833 --> 07:26.054
Okay, let's jump.

07:31.625 --> 07:34.149
Red alert.
Stamets, where are we?

07:34.149 --> 07:36.412
Okay, I got us
as close as I could

07:36.412 --> 07:38.980
with the margin of error
and the nav system damage.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.591
What the hell's happening
to the viewscreen?

07:41.591 --> 07:44.333
Those are gravity distortions.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.770
Well, we've landed in the
accretion disk of a black hole,

07:46.770 --> 07:48.076
- Captain.
-At this distance,

07:48.076 --> 07:49.512
I should be able to get us out.

07:49.512 --> 07:51.035
Asha, we're getting closer
to the red zone.

07:51.035 --> 07:52.646
It's pulling us in.
I don't understand why.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.299
Engineering, we're gonna
need more power.

07:54.299 --> 07:55.300
<i>STAMETS [over comms]:
I'm working on it.</i>

07:55.300 --> 07:57.085
Open the plasma injectors,

07:57.085 --> 07:58.739
- keep them locked at full.
- Got it.

07:58.739 --> 08:00.131
And, uh, we should override
the tolerance limiter.

08:00.131 --> 08:01.306
Which relay?

08:01.306 --> 08:02.351
- Over there.
- On the left?

08:02.351 --> 08:04.135
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

08:07.312 --> 08:09.097
<i>STAMETS [over comms]:
I'm giving you everything I have</i>

08:09.097 --> 08:11.142
<i>unless you pull from the cloak.</i>

08:11.142 --> 08:12.317
Rayner?

08:12.317 --> 08:13.580
No, we can't risk that.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.233
Maintain cloaking.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.713
Commander Asha,
what is our status?

08:16.713 --> 08:18.541
Gravitational pull's

08:18.541 --> 08:20.717
still too strong.
It doesn't make sense.

08:20.717 --> 08:22.240
No, it's because it's not

08:22.240 --> 08:23.938
one black hole,
it's-it's two black holes.

08:23.938 --> 08:25.896
It's a, it's a binary system.

08:25.896 --> 08:27.768
And they're-they're
primordial black holes,

08:27.768 --> 08:29.204
which is in--
that's interesting.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.988
- Tilly.
-Yeah, no. Yes. Uh...

08:30.988 --> 08:34.601
If we can change our heading
to 320 mark seven

08:34.601 --> 08:36.559
and move closer
to the other black hole,

08:36.559 --> 08:38.996
we can use its gravity
to pull us away.

08:38.996 --> 08:41.085
That-that, plus our, uh,
engines, that should be enough.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.435
- Good thinking, Lieutenant.
- Do it, Asha.

08:45.481 --> 08:47.527
Everyone hold on tight.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.925
<i>
Warning.</i>

08:54.925 --> 08:57.101
<i>Significant gravitational
shearing detected.</i>

09:00.757 --> 09:03.412
The second black hole is
coming into range.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.718
Tilly...

09:04.718 --> 09:07.068
It's gonna work. It'll work.

09:16.860 --> 09:19.080
And we're clear.

09:28.089 --> 09:29.917
Hey.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.440
Drinks on me tonight.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.530
It's "tonight" somewhere.
Do we have to wait?

09:34.530 --> 09:37.402
Nice work, everybody.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.230
Rhys, any sign
of the dreadnaught?

09:39.230 --> 09:41.189
No. Seems we beat them here.

09:41.189 --> 09:42.843
Can't be by much.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.758
Asha, how far are we
from target coordinates?

09:44.758 --> 09:47.891
Approximately
60,000 kilometers, sir.

09:47.891 --> 09:50.154
- Set a course.
- Aye, Captain.

09:50.154 --> 09:51.982
Lieutenant Tilly,
now that we're more in range,

09:51.982 --> 09:53.288
what can you tell us
about the target?

09:53.288 --> 09:55.072
Coordinates are in the

09:55.072 --> 09:57.466
Lagrange point
of the two black holes,

09:57.466 --> 09:58.989
which means that
the Progenitors' tech

09:58.989 --> 10:01.601
has been in gravitational
equilibrium since...

10:01.601 --> 10:03.298
I mean, the...

10:03.298 --> 10:04.821
these black holes,
they predate everything else

10:04.821 --> 10:06.867
in the galaxy, so...

10:06.867 --> 10:09.086
So since they put them there.

10:09.086 --> 10:10.653
Can we get it onscreen?

10:10.653 --> 10:14.091
That's odd.
Nothing's registering on scans,

10:14.091 --> 10:16.354
but if we filter out
all the environmental debris,

10:16.354 --> 10:18.139
seems like what
we're looking for is...

10:18.139 --> 10:19.880
this.

10:24.101 --> 10:25.842
There it is.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.369
Any idea what's inside of it?

10:31.369 --> 10:32.762
No. Spectral analysis

10:32.762 --> 10:34.764
shows the structure is composed

10:34.764 --> 10:37.332
of a duranium alloy,
which is impenetrable to scans.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.725
Sounds deliberate.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.117
Yeah, if we were
any further away,

10:40.117 --> 10:41.728
we wouldn't even know
it was there,

10:41.728 --> 10:43.338
but it's, uh, it's about
the size of a small shuttle,

10:43.338 --> 10:45.906
and it was made
approximately 800 years ago.

10:45.906 --> 10:49.170
So it was built at the same time
the clue trail was laid.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.780
The scientists
must've constructed it

10:50.780 --> 10:52.652
to hide the Progenitors'
technology.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.437
Until the "worthy seeker"
arrived.

10:56.612 --> 10:58.005
Power of creation.

10:58.005 --> 11:00.224
Thought it'd be... bigger.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.052
The tech has to be in there.

11:02.052 --> 11:04.620
We have to get it on board.

11:04.620 --> 11:07.231
Captain, we have
a warp signal incoming.

11:07.231 --> 11:08.711
It's Ruhn's dreadnaught.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.278
- How long till they're here?
- Right now.

11:12.193 --> 11:13.542
Weapons ready if we need them.

11:13.542 --> 11:14.935
They're taking the structure.

11:14.935 --> 11:17.459
- Asha.
- I-I can't get us there in time.

11:17.459 --> 11:18.765
Can you stop the tractor beam
from here?

11:18.765 --> 11:20.288
We'd have to drop our cloak.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.420
It doesn't matter. Too late.

11:22.420 --> 11:24.248
The Breen have it.

11:31.603 --> 11:34.345
So, what... what do we do now?

11:40.221 --> 11:42.614
We're gonna find a way
to get it back.

13:12.748 --> 13:15.533
Okay, we know that
Moll's holding the structure

13:15.533 --> 13:17.666
inside the Breen shuttle bay,
and my guess is,

13:17.666 --> 13:20.625
it won't take her long
to open it. So, Tilly?

13:20.625 --> 13:23.411
Initial scans
of the object show this.

13:23.411 --> 13:26.153
It appears to be
a small opening or access point.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.285
If you compare it with the map
of clues we gathered...

13:28.285 --> 13:31.245
It's a keyhole.
And Moll has the key.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.203
Yeah, but it's not enough
alone to gain access

13:33.203 --> 13:34.857
to the Progenitors' technology.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.859
In the mindscape, I was told

13:36.859 --> 13:38.861
that there would be
another obstacle inside of it,

13:38.861 --> 13:40.471
and I got information
on how to beat it.

13:42.038 --> 13:43.083
Moll doesn't have that.

13:43.083 --> 13:45.259
What information, exactly?

13:45.259 --> 13:46.869
A phrase:

13:46.869 --> 13:49.959
"Build the shape of the one
between the many."

13:49.959 --> 13:51.961
That's... cryptic.

13:51.961 --> 13:53.963
I trust it'll make sense
when it needs to.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.486
We do have another advantage.

13:55.486 --> 13:57.271
They think we're dead,
so that buys us time

13:57.271 --> 13:59.490
if we can figure out
how to get the structure back.

13:59.490 --> 14:02.754
Well, that's why we're all here.
Stamets, what are our options?

14:02.754 --> 14:04.844
Um... limited.
To get the structure,

14:04.844 --> 14:06.889
we'll need to beam it out,
but we can't do that

14:06.889 --> 14:08.848
unless we take down
the shields first.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.894
And even then,
locking onto it will be tricky.

14:11.894 --> 14:15.289
We'd need to be
in extremely close proximity.

14:15.289 --> 14:16.899
We'd be destroyed
before we got anywhere close

14:16.899 --> 14:17.900
to the shuttle bay.

14:17.900 --> 14:19.380
What about a transpo-lock?

14:20.511 --> 14:22.644
W-We used them
when I was in the E.D.F.,

14:22.644 --> 14:24.689
Mars had a lot of interference.

14:24.689 --> 14:27.214
Point being is, if we attach it
to the structure,

14:27.214 --> 14:29.912
we can, uh, lock on
and beam out instantly

14:29.912 --> 14:31.740
- once we take down shields.
-Yes.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.524
Good, that's good.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.526
Problem is, we can't

14:35.526 --> 14:38.312
do any of that unless
we can get ourselves on board

14:38.312 --> 14:39.922
the dreadnaught.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.012
Then that's what
we'll have to do.

14:46.842 --> 14:48.626
We'll need two teams.

14:48.626 --> 14:51.281
Our scan data
from the run-in with the Breen

14:51.281 --> 14:53.370
shows there's a gap
in the shield coverage

14:53.370 --> 14:55.329
right at the exhaust port.
That's a weakness,

14:55.329 --> 14:57.331
<i>and that's where we infiltrate.</i>

14:57.331 --> 14:59.637
<i>We'll fly a shuttle in, and
we'll beam aboard from there.</i>

14:59.637 --> 15:01.465
<i>Alpha Team
will go to the bridge.</i>

15:01.465 --> 15:03.293
<i>Hack into systems and stand by
to take down shields</i>

15:03.293 --> 15:04.773
<i>for the rest of the ship,</i>

15:04.773 --> 15:06.470
<i>while Bravo Team
goes to the shuttle bay.</i>

15:06.470 --> 15:08.211
<i>Once inside, they'll find a way</i>

15:08.211 --> 15:10.170
<i>to attach the transpo-lock
onto the structure.</i>

15:10.170 --> 15:11.911
<i>Then Alpha Team
will drop shields,</i>

15:11.911 --> 15:13.477
<i>and we'll beam both teams
and the structure</i>

15:13.477 --> 15:14.652
<i>back to</i> Discovery.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.092
This is insane.

15:19.092 --> 15:20.702
Maybe,

15:20.702 --> 15:22.791
but it could work.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.401
And it is our only other option.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.621
- I agree.
-Okay,

15:26.621 --> 15:27.970
um, using the exhaust ports
is clever,

15:27.970 --> 15:29.406
I'll give you that, but...

15:29.406 --> 15:31.321
Good, because you're
gonna pilot us in.

15:31.321 --> 15:33.889
Okay, even if
we can get on board,

15:33.889 --> 15:37.023
Breen programming code
is base-duodeca

15:37.023 --> 15:40.069
- and hacking that
is incredibly complex.
-I-I can handle that.

15:40.069 --> 15:41.549
I analyzed the code

15:41.549 --> 15:43.420
behind the Breen
shield-tunneling technology.

15:43.420 --> 15:45.814
I-I-I know my way
around it already.

15:45.814 --> 15:48.077
Are you asking to go
on this mission, Ensign?

15:48.077 --> 15:50.950
- Yes.
- What?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.255
- I am.
-No.

15:52.255 --> 15:54.083
I-I can do the hacking.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.737
Maybe not as quickly, but...

15:55.737 --> 15:57.608
Speed will be crucial here.

16:01.047 --> 16:03.136
What do you think?

16:09.272 --> 16:11.579
I think they can do it.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.061
Then it's settled.

16:15.061 --> 16:16.714
You'll be on Alpha Team,

16:16.714 --> 16:18.542
and I'll send Commander Rhys
for security backup.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.588
Book and I will be
on Bravo Team.

16:20.588 --> 16:22.633
And Rayner, you have the conn.

16:22.633 --> 16:25.680
Tilly, I'll ask that you serve
as my acting first officer.

16:25.680 --> 16:28.857
Yes, sir.
Thank you very... Good.

16:28.857 --> 16:31.294
Okay, not to be a stickler
for details, but,

16:31.294 --> 16:33.166
once we're on board,

16:33.166 --> 16:36.647
how the hell do we plan to move
around on a Breen-infested ship?

16:36.647 --> 16:38.258
In plain sight.

16:38.258 --> 16:39.911
<i>Scans of soldiers
from the Archive</i>

16:39.911 --> 16:41.609
<i>will let us replicate
Breen suits.</i>

16:41.609 --> 16:43.393
<i>We'll just need to add
translation tech.</i>

16:43.393 --> 16:45.221
<i>Breen culture
is rigidly hierarchical,</i>

16:45.221 --> 16:46.744
<i>so as long as we look the part</i>

16:46.744 --> 16:47.876
<i>and don't draw attention
to ourselves,</i>

16:47.876 --> 16:49.008
<i>we shouldn't be challenged.</i>

16:50.705 --> 16:52.315
For the record...

16:52.315 --> 16:53.708
it's still insane.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.753
We leave in ten.

17:04.980 --> 17:07.417
Take down the quarantine field.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.599
Is there any way of knowing
what's inside?

17:15.599 --> 17:17.906
Our scientists report
that the metallic composition

17:17.906 --> 17:20.474
make internal scans impossible.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.781
Then we'll just have to open it.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.103
Your Scion will reward you
for your service.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.383
What the hell just happened?
Where'd he go?

18:45.515 --> 18:46.951
In my language!

18:46.951 --> 18:50.346
What are we looking at?
What do you know?

18:50.346 --> 18:53.610
Our soldier no longer
registers on scans.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.873
This appears to be
an extra-dimensional gateway.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.614
To where, we cannot yet say.

18:57.614 --> 19:00.487
The Progenitors' tech must be
on the other side, then.

19:00.487 --> 19:03.054
I would suggest you return to
the bridge until our scientists

19:03.054 --> 19:05.187
can determine
if it is safe to enter.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.367
Something I have to do first.

19:12.586 --> 19:13.935
A portable pattern buffer?

19:13.935 --> 19:15.328
Once we find the tech,

19:15.328 --> 19:17.808
learning how to use it
could take time.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.767
This'll preserve
L'ak's body until then.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.697
I will bring you back.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.888
Not long ago, I was the one
going into the unknown

19:53.888 --> 19:57.848
on the Ten-C planet,
and you were wishing me luck.

19:57.848 --> 19:59.850
It's my turn, I guess.

19:59.850 --> 20:02.331
I'm proud of you.

20:02.331 --> 20:04.942
Also nervous. Very nervous.

20:04.942 --> 20:06.683
I-- Look, I am gonna be fine,

20:06.683 --> 20:08.642
and I will see you both
on the other side.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.296
<i>-Attention, please.</i>

20:10.296 --> 20:12.211
<i>Ensign Tal to shuttle bay.</i>

20:12.211 --> 20:15.214
Okay. Here we go.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.401
The away team is prepared
for launch, Commander.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.446
On your toes, everyone.

20:30.446 --> 20:31.926
Mission's up.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.808
Is it just me or does he never
sit in the captain's chair?

20:44.808 --> 20:46.984
Avoids it like the plague.
We've all noticed.

20:46.984 --> 20:49.639
Shuttle is leaving
shuttle bay in three,

20:49.639 --> 20:51.467
two, one.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.610
<i>
Getting close
to our entry point.</i>

21:03.610 --> 21:05.481
Raising shields now.

21:05.481 --> 21:07.266
Wait, we're going in there
while it's firing?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.572
It-It'll be at least
3,000 degrees Kelvin in there.

21:09.572 --> 21:11.487
But the heat will camouflage
our transporter signals

21:11.487 --> 21:13.097
so we can beam in undetected.

21:13.097 --> 21:14.751
How long will shields hold
at that temperature?

21:14.751 --> 21:16.710
About 60 seconds.

21:16.710 --> 21:18.364
- And after that?
- The shuttle burns to a crisp.

21:18.364 --> 21:20.322
Glad I asked.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.324
Our sensors indicate we're
entering the exhaust field.

21:22.324 --> 21:25.327
Okay, 60 seconds starts...

21:25.327 --> 21:26.589
now!

21:26.589 --> 21:28.287
<i>
Warning.</i>

21:28.287 --> 21:30.593
<i>Thermal radiation
is exceeding recommended levels.</i>

21:30.593 --> 21:33.509
55 seconds. 54.
Are we in position?

21:33.509 --> 21:34.989
Not yet.

21:34.989 --> 21:36.425
The exhaust fields are

21:36.425 --> 21:37.557
a bit more than I expected.
Then again,

21:37.557 --> 21:38.949
Then again, the last time I did

21:38.949 --> 21:39.646
something like this
was on my ship.

21:39.646 --> 21:40.995
50 seconds.

21:40.995 --> 21:42.344
Okay, you're stressing
me out here.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.215
Yeah, well, I thought you might

21:44.215 --> 21:45.652
want to know how long before
we're deep-fried. 45 seconds.

21:46.914 --> 21:48.742
We're good. Ready to beam.

21:48.742 --> 21:50.439
No! No, we're not.

21:50.439 --> 21:52.049
Our-our-our transportation
radius is being limited...

21:52.049 --> 21:53.355
Science later, problem now.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.487
There are two Breen life signs

21:54.487 --> 21:55.749
right where we have to beam in.

21:55.749 --> 21:57.359
Why can't we beam
someplace else?

21:57.359 --> 21:59.622
Science later, problem now.
We just can't.

21:59.622 --> 22:01.929
<i>
Warning. Hull breach imminent
in ten seconds.</i>

22:01.929 --> 22:04.584
- You said we had more time.
- Ensign Tal?

22:04.584 --> 22:06.716
<i>- ...eight, seven...</i>
- The life signs aren't moving.

22:06.716 --> 22:08.544
<i>- ...six, five...</i>
- All right, we'll figure it out.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.633
Helmets on. Now, now, now.

22:10.633 --> 22:13.593
<i>...three, two, one.</i>

22:21.165 --> 22:23.385
Stay calm.

22:28.129 --> 22:29.826
<i>ADIRA [over comms]:
What are they saying?</i>

22:29.826 --> 22:31.393
<i>BURNHAM [over comms]:
Give it a minute.</i>

22:31.393 --> 22:33.308
<i>Our suit will start translating
in real time.</i>

22:33.308 --> 22:35.528
I said justify yourselves.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.791
- Captain?
<i>-I've got it.</i>

22:37.791 --> 22:40.533
You pathetic achworm!

22:58.202 --> 22:59.726
Well played.

22:59.726 --> 23:02.163
Nobody likes a disgusted Scion.

23:02.163 --> 23:05.296
Well, we all know what we're
here to do. Let's get to it.

23:05.296 --> 23:06.428
Aye, Captain.

23:20.268 --> 23:22.009
I send this message

23:22.009 --> 23:25.447
to the eminent Breen Primarch
Tahal of the third flight.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.318
This is President Laira Rillak

23:27.318 --> 23:29.756
of the United Federation
of Planets.

23:29.756 --> 23:32.628
I request an immediate
audience on a matter

23:32.628 --> 23:34.238
of utmost urgency.

23:34.238 --> 23:36.284
I await your reply.

23:36.284 --> 23:39.548
Message was,
once again, received.

23:43.552 --> 23:45.249
Still no response.

23:47.034 --> 23:48.992
Then she is choosing
to ignore us.

23:48.992 --> 23:52.039
Damn it. We need some way
of stopping her fleet.

23:52.039 --> 23:55.956
With its Pathway drive,
the <i>Mitchell</i> could intercept.

23:55.956 --> 23:58.088
We can't risk
escalating this further.

23:58.088 --> 24:00.177
The sudden arrival
of a Federation starship

24:00.177 --> 24:02.092
could be perceived
as an act of aggression.

24:02.092 --> 24:03.746
What if it were not a starship,

24:03.746 --> 24:06.140
but a relatively
harmless shuttle?

24:06.140 --> 24:07.750
One was outfitted for testing

24:07.750 --> 24:09.317
at the start
of the Pathway program.

24:11.145 --> 24:14.148
A shuttle wouldn't be
remotely capable

24:14.148 --> 24:16.542
of engaging her entire fleet.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.326
Yet it could force
the face-to-face dialogue

24:18.326 --> 24:19.980
needed to slow her down,

24:19.980 --> 24:21.808
or alter her course.

24:21.808 --> 24:25.159
If the gesture is misunderstood,
it could be a suicide mission.

24:25.159 --> 24:28.031
If we wish to aid <i>Discovery,</i>

24:28.031 --> 24:30.033
it is our best option.

24:30.033 --> 24:31.687
Madam President,

24:31.687 --> 24:33.428
if the effort were to fail,

24:33.428 --> 24:36.039
we would need you here
to negotiate with the Breen.

24:37.563 --> 24:40.391
I'll need to send a delegate
who can speak on my behalf.

24:40.391 --> 24:43.699
I will draw up a list
of suitable candidates.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.396
If I may,

24:45.396 --> 24:47.398
uh, given my experience
with both tactical

24:47.398 --> 24:50.140
and diplomatic missions,
as well as the fact that

24:50.140 --> 24:52.142
it is my former ship at risk...

24:55.145 --> 24:57.496
...I would like to volunteer.

25:01.674 --> 25:03.589
Begin preparations.

25:03.589 --> 25:05.112
I'll inform the admiral.

25:05.112 --> 25:06.505
You'll need to leave
immediately.

25:22.129 --> 25:24.348
Disguises seem to be
holding up so far.

25:24.348 --> 25:25.567
Mm-hmm.

25:30.180 --> 25:33.053
...joining the <i>sarkaress...</i>

25:33.053 --> 25:34.663
He's using words
that aren't in the database.

25:34.663 --> 25:36.491
A <i>sarkaress</i>
is a Breen feast day.

25:36.491 --> 25:39.015
Okay. What do we say back?

25:39.015 --> 25:43.324
...joining the <i>sarkaress.</i>

25:44.630 --> 25:46.196
Of course we will join.

25:55.336 --> 25:57.164
Thank you, xenoanthropology.

25:57.164 --> 25:59.688
The gift that keeps on giving.

26:01.472 --> 26:02.735
You good?

26:02.735 --> 26:04.867
What makes you think I'm not?

26:04.867 --> 26:06.739
Cock of the head when I just
asked you that. Dead giveaway.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.871
Worried about the mission?

26:08.871 --> 26:10.699
No, it's...

26:10.699 --> 26:12.048
Come here.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.615
There's something
I need to tell you.

26:13.615 --> 26:15.051
Now is not an ideal time, but...

26:18.751 --> 26:20.883
In the mindscape,

26:20.883 --> 26:23.625
I had to look at some things
about myself.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.235
About us.

26:26.759 --> 26:29.065
Why I let us drift apart.

26:30.501 --> 26:31.938
Okay.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.071
I felt like I failed.

26:36.725 --> 26:39.380
And it was just easier
to turn away.

26:39.380 --> 26:43.297
I've been meaning to say
that I'm sorry.

26:44.864 --> 26:46.996
You deserved better.

26:49.303 --> 26:52.611
I did the same thing.
Same reason.

26:57.180 --> 26:59.095
I'm sorry, too.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.408
Heads up. Looks like there's
about to be a shift change.

27:10.672 --> 27:12.935
-We should go.
-Yeah.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.859
Our scientists have been
unable to determine

27:23.859 --> 27:25.382
what's inside the gateway.

27:25.382 --> 27:26.993
They believe the only way
to get reliable data

27:26.993 --> 27:29.256
is to send someone inside
with the proper equipment.

27:29.256 --> 27:31.606
Choose your
most trusted soldier.

27:33.695 --> 27:35.392
Captain,

27:35.392 --> 27:37.394
we're on the bridge.

27:37.394 --> 27:39.701
<i>And Moll is here.</i>

27:39.701 --> 27:42.443
<i>BURNHAM [over comms]:
All right, find a console
and get to work.</i>

27:42.443 --> 27:44.924
There, that symbol on his arm,

27:44.924 --> 27:47.361
he's the lowest ranking soldier.

27:47.361 --> 27:48.667
That's our mark.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.320
Everyone always picks on
the ensign.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.935
There's a malfunction
at your station.

27:55.935 --> 27:58.415
You must vacate it
while we fix it.

27:58.415 --> 27:59.721
That's an order.

28:05.509 --> 28:06.815
<i>
It's all you.</i>

28:13.604 --> 28:15.694
Hey, you got this.

28:17.521 --> 28:21.047
Captain, I'm at a console.
Hacking into shield systems now.

28:21.047 --> 28:22.788
<i>
Good. We should be at shuttle
bay in about five minutes.</i>

28:22.788 --> 28:24.398
<i>Commander Rayner?</i>

28:24.398 --> 28:26.748
All set, Captain.
Soon as shields drop,

28:26.748 --> 28:28.402
we'll get the structure
and all of you out of there.

28:28.402 --> 28:30.621
Commander Stamets
is standing by to jump.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.188
<i>BURNHAM [over comms]:
I'll keep you posted.
Burnham out.</i>

28:32.188 --> 28:33.407
All right,

28:33.407 --> 28:34.669
let's run through this again.

28:34.669 --> 28:35.844
No surprises.

28:35.844 --> 28:37.759
Lieutenant Linus, cloak status?

28:37.759 --> 28:39.718
It remains at 100%.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.677
Jemison, Naya,
shields and scans?

28:42.677 --> 28:44.374
Shields are nominal, Commander.

28:44.374 --> 28:46.420
Still no evidence of any scans
from the dreadnaught.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.204
They don't seem to know
we're here.

28:48.204 --> 28:49.858
Good. Gallo,
what about tactical?

28:49.858 --> 28:51.599
All systems armed and ready.

28:51.599 --> 28:53.775
Tilly, what's the latest
on Tahal?

28:53.775 --> 28:55.821
Mr. Saru says she and her fleet
are less than two hours away.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.344
Hopefully, we'll be long gone

28:57.344 --> 28:58.911
with the Progenitors'
technology by then.

28:58.911 --> 29:01.391
We'd better be.

29:01.391 --> 29:03.393
Excuse me, sir, um,

29:03.393 --> 29:05.700
respectfully, the pacing,

29:05.700 --> 29:08.094
you're making everybody nervous.

29:08.094 --> 29:09.878
You can sit in
the captain's chair, you know.

29:09.878 --> 29:11.619
If I felt like it, I would.

29:11.619 --> 29:13.926
Captain Burnham,
she trusts you to lead us.

29:13.926 --> 29:16.276
We all do,
and it's bit of a road

29:16.276 --> 29:19.061
to get there, but we really, um,
we really do.

29:19.061 --> 29:21.237
You know why I asked you serve

29:21.237 --> 29:22.848
as my Number One today,
Lieutenant?

29:22.848 --> 29:26.068
No, sir. Actually, I don't.

29:26.068 --> 29:28.244
It's because
you're smart as hell,

29:28.244 --> 29:29.768
you're a good leader,

29:29.768 --> 29:31.247
and if we were stuck
in a foxhole together,

29:31.247 --> 29:33.336
I wouldn't kill you.

29:33.336 --> 29:35.730
That is, unless
you gave me more of that

29:35.730 --> 29:39.560
warm and fuzzy encouragement

29:39.560 --> 29:41.301
that I don't need.

29:46.872 --> 29:48.308
Shuttle bay's through there.

30:02.496 --> 30:04.367
You think these replicated suits
will get us through?

30:04.367 --> 30:06.108
One way to find out.

30:06.108 --> 30:07.414
Go ahead.

30:25.693 --> 30:27.608
How many times must I remind you

30:27.608 --> 30:29.305
to complete
your clearance forms?

30:34.528 --> 30:36.095
You said you
turned them in for me.

30:37.923 --> 30:39.359
How dare you accuse me?

30:42.928 --> 30:44.233
<i>
All right, that's enough.</i>

30:44.233 --> 30:45.887
<i>
If you say so.</i>

31:12.827 --> 31:13.959
<i>
Well played.</i>

31:13.959 --> 31:15.482
<i>
You, too.</i>

31:15.482 --> 31:17.049
Let's take care of these guys
and get to work.

31:18.093 --> 31:19.703
<i>
We'll hide 'em over here.</i>

31:37.765 --> 31:39.767
They're sending someone inside.

31:39.767 --> 31:41.638
<i>
What the hell is that?</i>

31:50.909 --> 31:52.606
<i>
Some kind of portal.</i>

31:52.606 --> 31:55.217
That has to be what leads
to the Progenitors' tech.

31:56.653 --> 31:58.829
<i>
Damn it, they put up
a quarantine field.</i>

31:58.829 --> 32:00.135
I'm gonna have
to take that down

32:00.135 --> 32:01.223
if we want to secure
the transpo-lock.

32:01.223 --> 32:03.182
There.

32:03.182 --> 32:05.184
Field draws power

32:05.184 --> 32:07.708
from that box. Cut the power,
field goes down.

32:07.708 --> 32:10.667
<i>
I guess I'm joining
the science division.</i>

32:10.667 --> 32:13.975
<i>You...
you're on distraction duty.</i>

32:13.975 --> 32:15.934
<i>-What?
-Mm-hmm.</i>

32:23.158 --> 32:24.507
<i>
Uh...</i>

32:24.507 --> 32:26.118
Hello.

32:27.162 --> 32:28.772
<i>
Hello?</i>

32:28.772 --> 32:30.383
<i>
You excited for the</i> sarkaress?

32:30.383 --> 32:33.342
<i>
After our Scion is reborn,</i>

32:33.342 --> 32:35.562
<i>we'll hold the greatest</i>
sarkaress <i>yet.</i>

32:35.562 --> 32:37.346
<i>
Oh, yeah.
No question.</i>

32:38.347 --> 32:40.045
<i>Hey, so, um...</i>

32:40.045 --> 32:43.004
Do you know
who you're going with?

32:45.354 --> 32:47.226
<i>...maybe we could, uh...</i>

32:47.226 --> 32:49.489
Wow. Flirting. Bold move.

32:49.489 --> 32:52.883
<i>
You wish to be
one of my sarkmates?</i>

32:52.883 --> 32:54.668
Sure. Why not?

32:54.668 --> 32:56.278
<i>
Very well.</i>

32:56.278 --> 32:59.064
<i>I shall prepare a space
for you in the oil bath.</i>

32:59.064 --> 33:01.501
Hurry up, Michael,
this is getting weird.

33:01.501 --> 33:03.546
<i>
Are you sure you don't want me
to slow down?</i>

33:03.546 --> 33:05.287
Try to get you that oil bath?

33:08.377 --> 33:09.726
<i>BURNHAM [over comms]:
Rhys, Adira, how are things</i>

33:09.726 --> 33:10.945
<i>going on the bridge?</i>

33:10.945 --> 33:11.859
-Got it.

33:13.817 --> 33:16.037
- Shields ready to drop, Captain.
<i>-Good work.</i>

33:16.037 --> 33:17.517
<i>I'll tell you when.</i>

33:17.517 --> 33:19.345
What do you mean
they couldn't pull him back out?

33:19.345 --> 33:20.824
The cable was bonded
to the floor,

33:20.824 --> 33:22.043
they saw what happened
last time.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.784
The force of it was too great.

33:23.784 --> 33:25.394
- Wherever it leads, it seems...

33:25.394 --> 33:27.005
What are they saying?

33:27.005 --> 33:29.442
There are guards missing
from their post

33:29.442 --> 33:31.052
outside shuttle bay.

33:31.052 --> 33:34.012
I thought your troops were
better trained than that.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.883
They are.

33:38.320 --> 33:41.410
Put the shuttle bay
in full lockdown.

33:41.410 --> 33:42.977
All credentials checked.

33:42.977 --> 33:45.327
<i>Captain, I've got bad news.</i>

33:50.506 --> 33:51.681
This is gonna be a problem.

33:58.862 --> 34:01.039
I am told that your shuttle
is ready.

34:02.692 --> 34:05.347
I had ordered all relevant
intelligence files

34:05.347 --> 34:07.784
on Primarch Tahal
to be transferred to you.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.873
I hope some of it
will prove useful.

34:09.873 --> 34:12.833
Uh, yes. Uh...

34:12.833 --> 34:15.575
It already has.
I just finished reviewing it.

34:20.145 --> 34:22.190
You have only just returned.

34:22.190 --> 34:24.453
I'm sorry you must depart again.

34:24.453 --> 34:26.716
I know you did not want this.

34:26.716 --> 34:29.676
The list you offered
to draw up at the meeting...

34:29.676 --> 34:32.374
I understand your desire

34:32.374 --> 34:34.115
to protect me. However...

34:34.115 --> 34:36.378
The intent of the list

34:36.378 --> 34:38.554
was to protect the mission.

34:38.554 --> 34:41.340
While I do worry
for your safety, of course,

34:41.340 --> 34:44.995
it is of critical importance.

34:47.433 --> 34:50.697
I feared you may hesitate
to take the necessary risks,

34:50.697 --> 34:52.655
as we are so close
to our wedding.

34:52.655 --> 34:55.745
Surely you know I would never
allow personal considerations

34:55.745 --> 34:58.705
to interfere with my
professional responsibilities.

34:58.705 --> 35:00.881
Not consciously, perhaps, but...

35:00.881 --> 35:03.275
Vulcans are not the only species

35:03.275 --> 35:06.147
capable of choosing
logic and duty

35:06.147 --> 35:08.671
over emotion.

35:10.847 --> 35:13.111
Fair point.

35:14.503 --> 35:18.290
We have both chosen
lives of service.

35:20.074 --> 35:23.686
To balance that
with our love for one another

35:23.686 --> 35:26.124
will never be easy.

35:26.124 --> 35:29.257
But at least...

35:29.257 --> 35:33.305
we can face
that struggle together.

35:35.437 --> 35:38.310
It would be illogical

35:38.310 --> 35:41.269
to ask that you promise
to return.

35:42.270 --> 35:43.445
So, instead,

35:43.445 --> 35:45.839
I only ask that you will try.

36:06.033 --> 36:09.079
I shall see you when I return.

36:24.834 --> 36:27.097
<i>
They're gonna find us
any second.</i>

36:27.097 --> 36:28.403
I just need a few more minutes

36:28.403 --> 36:30.057
to get the
containment field down.

36:30.057 --> 36:31.189
<i>We don't have
a few more minutes.</i>

36:31.189 --> 36:32.581
<i>We need that field down now.</i>

36:32.581 --> 36:34.931
I have an idea, Captain.
It's risky, but...

36:34.931 --> 36:36.585
<i>BURNHAM [over comms]:
Whatever it is, I trust you.
Just do it.</i>

36:36.585 --> 36:37.630
Okay, then.

36:37.630 --> 36:40.546
Nothing grabs the attention

36:40.546 --> 36:42.200
like an unwelcome guest.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.593
Especially one
that they think is dead.

36:44.593 --> 36:47.117
Lieutenant Christopher,
hail the dreadnaught.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.077
Aye, Commander.

36:52.688 --> 36:54.647
I'm heading down
to the shuttle bay.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.779
Tell them I want to see
the crew personally.

36:56.779 --> 37:00.174
Moll, wait. We are being hailed

37:00.174 --> 37:02.220
- by <i>Discovery.</i>
- What?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.134
Are you sure?

37:05.310 --> 37:07.137
Yes. It is them.

37:07.137 --> 37:09.227
They survived.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.451
Put us on alert.

37:16.451 --> 37:17.974
Weapons armed.

37:17.974 --> 37:19.802
You heard her!

37:19.802 --> 37:22.196
On alert,
all weapon systems armed now.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.680
Answer the hail.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.465
This is Commander Rayner
of the USS <i>Discovery.</i>

37:30.465 --> 37:32.293
<i>MOLL [over comms]:
Where's the captain?</i>

37:32.293 --> 37:33.686
She's dead.

37:35.035 --> 37:37.603
You and your Breen friends
killed her in your attack.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.390
<i>
Whatever he's doing,
it's working.</i>

37:42.390 --> 37:45.001
<i>
Good. Stay alert. Let me know
if anything changes.</i>

37:45.001 --> 37:47.961
Whatever happened,
it wasn't me or us.

37:47.961 --> 37:49.615
It was Ruhn,

37:49.615 --> 37:51.530
but he's dead now, too,

37:51.530 --> 37:53.923
and I have
the Progenitors' tech.

37:53.923 --> 37:56.143
So we have nothing more
to talk about.

37:56.143 --> 37:59.886
Yes, we do. You need our help.

37:59.886 --> 38:01.670
<i>
With what, exactly?</i>

38:01.670 --> 38:03.324
Primarch Tahal.
She's on her way.

38:03.324 --> 38:05.195
Wants your dreadnaught
and every soldier on it.

38:07.154 --> 38:09.330
Check long-range scans.

38:09.330 --> 38:11.985
You can run,
but she'll track you,

38:11.985 --> 38:14.030
and keep tracking you.
Believe me, I know.

38:14.030 --> 38:16.424
She won't give up,
but if you turn yourself in,

38:16.424 --> 38:20.298
give us the technology,
the Federation will protect you.

38:20.298 --> 38:22.735
I don't need you

38:22.735 --> 38:24.824
or your Federation.

38:27.783 --> 38:29.089
Shit.

38:29.089 --> 38:31.918
Captain, how close are you?

38:31.918 --> 38:33.136
<i>
Almost done.</i>

38:33.136 --> 38:34.268
Rhys, Tal,

38:34.268 --> 38:35.791
<i>what's Moll doing?</i>

38:37.619 --> 38:39.534
She's leaving.
What does that mean?

38:39.534 --> 38:41.144
Nothing good.

38:41.144 --> 38:43.712
Captain, you're running
out of time.

38:43.712 --> 38:45.801
<i>
Got it.</i>

38:45.801 --> 38:47.760
<i>Commander, stand by.
We're attaching</i>

38:47.760 --> 38:49.849
the transport lock now.

38:49.849 --> 38:51.938
<i>-Oh!</i>

39:01.339 --> 39:03.471
Transpo-lock. Clever.

39:04.864 --> 39:06.518
Lose your helmets.

39:13.829 --> 39:15.178
Hmm.

39:16.441 --> 39:19.095
Not so dead after all.

39:26.102 --> 39:27.452
Commander Rhys, Ensign Tal,
it's <i>Discovery.</i>

39:27.452 --> 39:29.236
Do you read?

39:30.455 --> 39:31.760
Yes, sir.

39:31.760 --> 39:33.414
Bravo Team has been captured.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.851
<i>- Is your position secure?
-So far.</i>

39:35.851 --> 39:38.506
<i>- Yeah.
-We need to beam
you all out of there.</i>

39:38.506 --> 39:39.855
Prepare to lower shields.

39:39.855 --> 39:41.640
What about the structure?

39:41.640 --> 39:43.424
<i>We'll have to find
another way to get it.</i>

39:43.424 --> 39:45.121
Stand by.
Captain's comms are still live.

39:45.121 --> 39:47.080
She'll give us a sign
when she's ready.

39:49.517 --> 39:51.127
<i>
Respect where it's due.</i>

39:51.127 --> 39:53.260
How'd you get on board?

39:53.260 --> 39:55.741
A good courier never reveals
their secrets.

39:55.741 --> 39:57.525
Cute.

39:57.525 --> 39:59.527
Did your "mentor"
teach you that?

39:59.527 --> 40:01.224
Listen, Moll,

40:01.224 --> 40:03.357
- we know you want
to get L'ak back.
-Don't.

40:03.357 --> 40:06.055
Don't you say his name.

40:07.796 --> 40:09.102
Throw them in the brig

40:09.102 --> 40:10.843
and take us to warp

40:10.843 --> 40:12.845
before Tahal gets here.

40:12.845 --> 40:15.021
Jemison, get ready to transport.

40:15.021 --> 40:16.501
<i>
Wait, wait.</i>

40:16.501 --> 40:18.807
I haven't gotten to get
my grum of osikod,

40:18.807 --> 40:20.505
as the saying goes.

40:24.770 --> 40:25.988
Osikod.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.643
It's a message. She's...

40:28.643 --> 40:30.123
sending me a message.

40:30.123 --> 40:31.777
<i>
Remember when we first met?</i>

40:31.777 --> 40:33.256
When I was hanging off
the side of your ship.

40:33.256 --> 40:34.388
What about it?

40:34.388 --> 40:35.476
Well, I knew you wouldn't stop,

40:35.476 --> 40:37.304
but neither would I.

40:37.304 --> 40:39.001
And the difference is,

40:39.001 --> 40:40.525
when I thought I was gone--

40:40.525 --> 40:43.136
your shields were fried,

40:43.136 --> 40:44.790
I was flying
out there all alone,

40:44.790 --> 40:47.227
out in space--

40:47.227 --> 40:49.316
I always knew my crew
would come for me.

40:50.622 --> 40:53.929
Just like they'll
come for us now,

40:53.929 --> 40:56.018
whatever you do.

40:59.326 --> 41:00.980
Good talk.

41:00.980 --> 41:03.635
Throw them in the brig.

41:03.635 --> 41:05.637
We'll drop you off somewhere
once we're in the clear.

41:05.637 --> 41:07.508
I know what she wants us to do.

41:07.508 --> 41:09.858
- I definitely don't.
-Ensign Tal,

41:09.858 --> 41:11.599
stand by to lower shields
on my mark.

41:11.599 --> 41:14.254
- We're gonna need access
to that shuttle bay.
- What?

41:14.254 --> 41:15.951
Commander Stamets, you have
two minutes to figure out

41:15.951 --> 41:17.866
how to rip through the
shuttle bay containment field

41:17.866 --> 41:19.955
without destroying ourselves
in the process.

41:19.955 --> 41:21.609
-On it, Commander.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

41:21.609 --> 41:23.393
If you do that, you're gonna
blast everything in there

41:23.393 --> 41:25.395
out into space,
including Michael and Book.

41:25.395 --> 41:28.747
Exactly, and then we beam them
and the structure on board

41:28.747 --> 41:31.227
the <i>Discovery.</i> That's her plan.

41:31.227 --> 41:32.968
Oh, holy shnoodle.

41:32.968 --> 41:35.188
Red alert. Decloak,

41:35.188 --> 41:37.582
set course
for the Breen shuttle bay.

41:37.582 --> 41:40.454
And start firing
with everything we've got.

41:41.499 --> 41:44.240
I just heard.
Are we really doing this?

41:44.240 --> 41:46.895
Apparently. But I-I think
I've got a way,

41:46.895 --> 41:48.375
as long as shields hold.

42:04.130 --> 42:05.566
Come on!

42:08.264 --> 42:10.919
We just lost torpedo bay seven.

42:10.919 --> 42:12.007
Gallo, keep firing.

42:12.007 --> 42:13.356
Don't let up.

42:13.356 --> 42:14.836
Jemison, what's our status?

42:14.836 --> 42:16.229
We're-we're okay for now,

42:16.229 --> 42:17.143
but we can't take
many more direct hits.

42:17.143 --> 42:18.579
Stamets, time's up.

42:18.579 --> 42:19.972
<i>How do we do this?</i>

42:19.972 --> 42:23.366
Okay, uh, i-if we fly
at full impulse,

42:23.366 --> 42:26.369
tilted down 35.2 degrees

42:26.369 --> 42:27.849
<i>with, uh, modulating shields</i>

42:27.849 --> 42:29.590
<i>concentrated on the deflector dish,</i>

42:29.590 --> 42:31.374
we can pierce
the containment field

42:31.374 --> 42:34.029
and still maintain
structural integrity.

42:34.029 --> 42:35.204
Do you actually think
it'll work?

42:35.204 --> 42:36.858
Math doesn't lie.

42:36.858 --> 42:39.469
We're gonna get Adira out.

42:39.469 --> 42:41.210
We'll get them all out.

42:46.041 --> 42:48.478
How much longer, Rayner?

42:48.478 --> 42:50.829
- 90 seconds to impact.
<i>-We'll try
to hold them off that long.</i>

42:50.829 --> 42:52.352
As soon as that structure
gets blown into space,

42:52.352 --> 42:54.920
- grab it with a tractor beam.
- Aye, Commander.

42:59.925 --> 43:01.491
<i>
Tal, drop shields now.</i>

43:02.754 --> 43:05.495
- Done.

43:07.106 --> 43:09.804
<i>
Heads up, guards coming our way.</i>

43:09.804 --> 43:11.240
<i>
What do we do?</i>

43:11.240 --> 43:13.112
<i>
Stay put. I got this.</i>

43:26.952 --> 43:29.998
<i></i>
Discovery, <i>get us out of here.</i>

43:38.616 --> 43:40.095
They're going to ram us.

43:40.095 --> 43:42.054
So they can send it...

43:42.054 --> 43:43.882
"out in space."

43:44.883 --> 43:46.711
- I have to go in there.
- Wait.

43:46.711 --> 43:48.451
You do not know what is inside.

43:48.451 --> 43:50.279
If I can't bring L'ak back,
I might as well be dead.

43:50.279 --> 43:52.020
<i>-Ready
to beam you, Captain.</i>
- Not yet.

43:52.020 --> 43:54.675
She's gonna go in. Cover me.

43:54.675 --> 43:56.416
Moll, wait!

44:07.949 --> 44:09.124
Michael!

44:48.207 --> 44:50.644
<i>
Commander, you have to grab
that. Michael is in there.</i>

44:50.644 --> 44:53.081
- She went into the portal.
- What?

44:53.081 --> 44:54.692
Jemison, lock on.
Engage tractor beam.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.824
It's moving too fast.
There's too much debris.

44:56.824 --> 44:58.217
Asha, get us closer. Tilly,

44:58.217 --> 45:00.175
scan the portal.
What's it telling us?

45:00.175 --> 45:01.786
No, sh...

45:01.786 --> 45:04.310
No, there's no sign of her.
She's just...

45:05.659 --> 45:07.661
- She's just gone.
- No.

45:09.315 --> 45:10.446
She's not.

45:10.446 --> 45:12.013
She's alive.

45:12.013 --> 45:13.188
I know it.

45:14.799 --> 45:16.714
Listen up.

45:16.714 --> 45:19.368
Our captain is in there.

45:19.368 --> 45:22.371
The Progenitors' tech
is in there.

45:24.678 --> 45:27.637
We're getting them both back.

45:27.637 --> 45:29.988
Failure...

45:29.988 --> 45:32.730
not an option.

45:37.735 --> 45:39.606
All right.

45:44.306 --> 45:46.134
Let's do this.
