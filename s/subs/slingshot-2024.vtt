01:59.912 --> 02:01.293
<i>Hello, John.</i>

02:01.397 --> 02:05.573
<i>You are emerging
from deep hibernation.</i>

02:05.677 --> 02:10.475
<i>You are aboard the spacecraft
Odyssey-1, bound for Titan.</i>

02:13.995 --> 02:16.032
<i>Please be careful.</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:18.517
<i>The drugs used
to induce hibernation</i>

02:18.621 --> 02:21.106
<i>can produce mild side-effects,</i>

02:21.210 --> 02:28.355
<i>including confusion, nausea,
dizziness and disorientation.</i>

02:29.908 --> 02:32.600
<i>You are nine months, one day</i>

02:32.704 --> 02:35.362
<i>and 18 hours
into your mission.</i>

02:50.825 --> 02:52.586
You're awake! Good.

02:52.689 --> 02:55.105
Shit, shower, shave,
come on, shake a leg!

03:04.839 --> 03:07.773
<i>Initiate
manual operating system.</i>

03:09.948 --> 03:10.914
Nash!

03:11.812 --> 03:14.228
How are we on
artificial gravity?

03:15.816 --> 03:18.439
All spun on 1.01 G's.

03:19.854 --> 03:22.719
Thrusters spent 2%
less fuel than needed.

03:23.341 --> 03:24.583
Excellent!

03:25.895 --> 03:28.967
John, we have an incoming
video message from Ground.

03:29.070 --> 03:30.140
Will you tee it up
for us, please?

03:30.244 --> 03:31.349
Yes, sir.

03:33.972 --> 03:35.249
<i>Good morning Odyssey-1!</i>

03:35.353 --> 03:37.838
<i>Sam Napier here
from Houston, Texas.</i>

03:37.941 --> 03:41.428
<i>As I speak,
it's Thursday, 23 December,</i>

03:41.531 --> 03:44.258
<i>ten o'clock in the morning
Central Standard Time.</i>

03:44.362 --> 03:48.228
<i>May I be the first
to wish you happy holidays.</i>

03:48.331 --> 03:50.230
<i>Now, we've reviewed
Odyssey's data,</i>

03:50.333 --> 03:52.370
<i>and everything looks
five by five our end,</i>

03:52.473 --> 03:53.957
<i>so this message will be brief.</i>

03:54.061 --> 03:56.477
<i>We'd like you to run some
routine equipment checks</i>

03:56.581 --> 03:57.685
<i>and then back to sleep.</i>

03:57.789 --> 04:00.481
<i>Oh, yes, I need
to stress the importance</i>

04:00.585 --> 04:02.552
<i>of doing your
psych evaluation.</i>

04:02.656 --> 04:04.520
<i>This is the most
effective way we have</i>

04:04.623 --> 04:07.419
<i>to monitor
your cognitive status.</i>

04:07.523 --> 04:10.457
<i>Two more cycles
before Jupiter-orbit,</i>

04:10.560 --> 04:13.977
<i>and then the small matter
of gravitational slingshot,</i>

04:14.081 --> 04:16.221
<i>which will be upon us
before we know it.</i>

04:16.325 --> 04:18.982
<i>This is Sam Napier
at Mission Control.</i>

04:19.086 --> 04:20.190
<i>Over and out.</i>

04:20.501 --> 04:21.951
<i>Was that okay?</i>

04:22.054 --> 04:23.815
Let's get this done.

04:23.918 --> 04:26.645
Let's see here.
Oxygen level, okay.

04:26.749 --> 04:28.613
H2O, solid.

04:29.372 --> 04:30.511
All good.

04:43.248 --> 04:46.009
<i>How long
have you been gone, John?</i>

04:47.459 --> 04:48.978
Nine months, one day.

04:49.910 --> 04:52.015
Do you dream about space?

04:52.119 --> 04:54.190
<i>How many hibernation cycles</i>

04:54.294 --> 04:55.260
<i>have there been?</i>

04:55.364 --> 04:56.572
Three.

04:56.675 --> 04:59.057
<i>You have been gone
a long time, John.</i>

04:59.160 --> 05:01.646
<i>What is the thing
you miss most about home?</i>

05:08.860 --> 05:11.034
<i>What is the thing
you miss most about home?</i>

05:11.138 --> 05:12.967
Fresh air!

05:15.349 --> 05:16.419
Hello?

05:16.523 --> 05:18.766
<i>Evaluation complete.</i>

05:20.320 --> 05:21.424
Hey! Once you're done,

05:21.528 --> 05:24.013
Captain wants you
to check the radios.

05:24.116 --> 05:26.429
I can't remember
her last name.

05:26.533 --> 05:28.845
- Whose last name?
- Zoe.

05:31.020 --> 05:33.471
You know, the first couple
of hours are the worst.

05:33.574 --> 05:35.300
Anastasis makes me feel like

05:35.404 --> 05:37.923
my head is floating
off my shoulders.

05:38.027 --> 05:39.269
Hey!

05:39.373 --> 05:40.995
Don't worry about it.

05:41.099 --> 05:43.032
It's her last name.

05:45.206 --> 05:47.485
- You'd better...
- Check the radios.

06:33.254 --> 06:34.739
John?

06:34.842 --> 06:37.431
Let me introduce you
to Zoe Morgan.

06:37.535 --> 06:38.812
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:38.915 --> 06:41.918
Zoe is on our ATS team.
John's on our astronaut corps.

06:42.022 --> 06:44.473
Ah. Are you a candidate?

06:44.576 --> 06:45.750
- For Titan?
- Yeah.

06:45.853 --> 06:46.820
100%, yeah.

06:46.923 --> 06:49.029
Maybe you can put in
a good word for me.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.652
That was a joke. I'm kidding.

06:53.689 --> 06:55.242
You know,
actually it's a funny story

06:55.345 --> 06:56.381
how John and I met.

06:56.485 --> 06:59.004
I was on
a tandem recumbent bicycle.

06:59.108 --> 07:00.385
I cycle into work every day.

07:00.489 --> 07:02.111
Anyway,
my bike had a puncture,

07:02.214 --> 07:03.802
so I was on the tandem,
I was going up the--

07:03.906 --> 07:05.252
Have you ever ridden
on a tandem?

07:05.355 --> 07:07.461
- Me? No.
- It's not as easy as it looks.

07:07.565 --> 07:08.911
Let me get you a drink,
I'll tell you about it.

07:09.014 --> 07:10.740
Hey, John,
would you like something?

07:10.844 --> 07:11.845
Morgan.

07:15.883 --> 07:17.057
Zoe Morgan.

07:19.162 --> 07:21.441
Houston, this is Odyssey-1,
John speaking.

07:21.544 --> 07:23.063
Happy holidays
to everyone down there.

07:23.166 --> 07:26.653
Uh, we had a nice dehydrated
lentil stew for lunch,

07:26.756 --> 07:28.896
which was the closest thing we
could get to a holiday meal.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.071
And in lieu of beer,
we washed it down

07:31.174 --> 07:34.764
with some delicious
recycled urine-water.

07:34.868 --> 07:37.698
The waste-water recycling
system is working very well.

07:37.802 --> 07:38.630
We hope!

07:38.734 --> 07:40.218
- Yeah, we hope...
-Mmm-hmm.

07:40.321 --> 07:41.909
We put Odyssey
through her paces.

07:42.013 --> 07:44.947
Everything seems clean
and velocity is on track.

07:45.050 --> 07:47.225
It's hard to believe
it's been nine months already.

07:47.328 --> 07:50.021
At this rate, we should be
in the Saturnian System

07:50.124 --> 07:51.540
in the blink of an eye.

07:56.855 --> 07:57.787
Um...

07:58.616 --> 07:59.927
So we're going to turn in,

08:00.031 --> 08:02.136
and we'll speak to you again
in another 90 days.

08:02.240 --> 08:03.206
Over and out.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.004
<i>Hello, John.</i>

08:08.108 --> 08:12.837
<i>In a few seconds, you will be
entering deep hibernation.</i>

08:16.806 --> 08:20.983
<i>Relax your body and begin
to focus on your breathing.</i>

08:21.086 --> 08:23.537
<i>I really didn't
want it to be you.</i>

08:23.641 --> 08:26.506
<i>You will be asleep in five...</i>

08:27.196 --> 08:28.680
<i>four...</i>

08:29.198 --> 08:30.268
<i>three...</i>

08:31.027 --> 08:32.063
<i>two...</i>

08:33.271 --> 08:35.307
You know when this thing's
supposed to start?

08:35.411 --> 08:36.792
I gotta take a leak.

08:43.453 --> 08:45.007
Can everybody
take a seat?

08:48.044 --> 08:50.253
Excuse me.
Is anybody sitting here?

08:51.254 --> 08:52.670
Is this seat taken?

08:53.291 --> 08:54.292
Uh, no.

08:54.948 --> 08:55.914
Okay.

08:57.433 --> 08:58.641
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

09:00.574 --> 09:01.886
It's John, right?

09:02.403 --> 09:03.750
Yes.

09:03.853 --> 09:04.613
Yeah.

09:04.716 --> 09:06.684
- Zoe.
- Morgan.

09:06.787 --> 09:08.617
- Yes, I remember.
- Yeah.

09:10.998 --> 09:13.138
- Very exciting.
- Yes.

09:13.242 --> 09:15.865
<i>Over a billion
miles away lies a world</i>

09:15.969 --> 09:19.593
<i>that most resembles Earth
before life emerged.</i>

09:20.318 --> 09:21.284
<i>Titan.</i>

09:22.251 --> 09:25.841
<i>The largest of
Saturn's 82 moons,</i>

09:25.944 --> 09:28.222
<i>and the only known world
in our galaxy,</i>

09:28.326 --> 09:31.501
<i>other than Earth that
has liquid on its surface.</i>

09:31.605 --> 09:35.367
<i>But Titan's rivers and lakes
are not composed of water...</i>

09:36.058 --> 09:37.577
<i>but methane.</i>

09:37.680 --> 09:41.546
<i>A hydrocarbon
and potent greenhouse gas.</i>

09:41.650 --> 09:44.169
<i>But in order to reach
this distant moon,</i>

09:44.273 --> 09:47.621
<i>we'll need some help
from an unlikely source,</i>

09:47.725 --> 09:49.278
<i>Jupiter.</i>

09:49.381 --> 09:51.038
<i>Jupiter orbits the Sun</i>

09:51.142 --> 09:54.145
<i>at approximately
29,000 miles per hour.</i>

09:54.248 --> 09:55.387
I've seen this before.

09:55.491 --> 09:58.701
<i>We'll borrow a small chunk
of Jupiter's orbital velocity,</i>

09:58.805 --> 10:00.600
<i>for gravity assist...</i>

10:01.531 --> 10:03.499
<i>or a "slingshot",</i>

10:03.603 --> 10:08.055
<i>resulting in
a tremendous speed boost.</i>

10:08.159 --> 10:10.748
<i>The slingshot is
a breathtaking display</i>

10:10.851 --> 10:14.337
<i>of orbital mechanics
and our ticket to Titan.</i>

10:14.441 --> 10:17.306
<i>Early technology work
and concept design</i>

10:17.409 --> 10:19.480
<i>started nearly a decade ago.</i>

10:19.584 --> 10:21.206
<i>This cutting-edge spacecraft</i>

10:21.310 --> 10:23.381
<i>wouldn't exist
without the ingenuity</i>

10:23.484 --> 10:28.282
<i>and painstaking work of
a dedicated team of engineers.</i>

10:28.386 --> 10:31.769
<i>The Titan mission has
far-reaching implications</i>

10:31.872 --> 10:35.324
<i>not just a man's
exploration of the cosmos,</i>

10:35.427 --> 10:37.878
<i>but the life on planet Earth.</i>

10:39.017 --> 10:41.641
<i>Climate change remains
the primary threat</i>

10:41.744 --> 10:44.782
<i>to mankind's
long-term survival.</i>

10:45.472 --> 10:49.303
<i>Tapping into Titan's
abundant supply of methane</i>

10:49.407 --> 10:54.861
<i>will create countless sources
of clean energy for Earth.</i>

10:54.964 --> 10:57.726
<i>The Titan mission
is part of a greater journey</i>

10:57.829 --> 10:59.935
<i>to save our planet.</i>

11:00.038 --> 11:04.008
<i>For our children
and our children's children.</i>

11:05.078 --> 11:07.321
<i>But first,
we have to get there.</i>

11:08.598 --> 11:09.841
<i>Hello, John.</i>

11:09.945 --> 11:13.327
<i>You're emerging
from deep hibernation.</i>

11:13.431 --> 11:18.332
<i>You're aboard for spacecraft
Odyssey-1, bound for Titan.</i>

11:18.436 --> 11:20.541
<i>Please be careful.</i>

11:20.645 --> 11:23.061
<i>The drugs used
to induce hibernation</i>

11:23.165 --> 11:25.477
<i>can produce mild side-effects,</i>

11:25.581 --> 11:32.208
<i>including confusion, nausea,
dizziness and disorientation.</i>

11:33.969 --> 11:39.043
<i>You are one year and
five days into your mission.</i>

11:55.162 --> 11:57.578
<i>You have reached ten miles.</i>

11:57.682 --> 11:59.442
<i>Congratulations.</i>

12:01.859 --> 12:03.930
<i>Resuming exercise.</i>

12:22.017 --> 12:23.363
<i>John.</i>

13:03.990 --> 13:05.163
<i>John.</i>

13:39.197 --> 13:41.096
<i>Warning!</i>

13:41.199 --> 13:43.339
<i>Warning! Warning!</i>

13:43.788 --> 13:45.100
<i>Warning!</i>

13:45.203 --> 13:46.342
<i>Warning!</i>

13:46.446 --> 13:48.344
<i>Warning! Warning!</i>

14:26.382 --> 14:27.694
John.

14:27.797 --> 14:29.006
Johnny boy!

14:29.454 --> 14:30.870
How are you feeling?

14:33.113 --> 14:34.390
What happened?

14:34.494 --> 14:36.358
You got bumped
on the head pretty good.

14:36.461 --> 14:38.360
I mean
what happened to the ship?

14:38.463 --> 14:40.155
That's what
we're trying to figure out.

14:40.258 --> 14:42.605
You were the only one
awake when it happened.

14:44.849 --> 14:45.954
I was standing
right about here

14:46.057 --> 14:46.989
when I heard the impact,

14:47.093 --> 14:48.818
and then the panel falls.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.268
Hits me in the head.

15:07.009 --> 15:08.183
Holy shit!

15:11.911 --> 15:13.119
Oh, my God.

15:15.224 --> 15:16.225
Wow.

15:32.621 --> 15:34.726
John.
You all right up there?

15:36.418 --> 15:38.489
I'm reviewing
the exterior video feeds

15:38.592 --> 15:39.869
from the last three hours,

15:39.973 --> 15:41.733
I don't see anything.

15:41.837 --> 15:42.976
It's just empty space.

15:43.080 --> 15:45.737
What about life-support power?
Critical systems.

15:45.841 --> 15:46.946
Everything's coming up strong.

15:47.049 --> 15:49.879
Thrusters, navigation,
artificial gravity...

15:49.983 --> 15:51.674
It's like nothing happened.

15:51.778 --> 15:55.092
- Have we heard from Ground?
- No, I'll check comms.

15:55.782 --> 15:57.370
X-band is normal.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.717
Recycling the power.

16:07.828 --> 16:10.348
Up again. Self-test.

16:13.351 --> 16:14.732
That's us transmitting
to ourselves,

16:14.835 --> 16:16.423
so the system is working.

16:16.527 --> 16:18.115
I'm gonna go
reexamine the damage.

16:18.218 --> 16:20.255
You two keep working here.

16:20.358 --> 16:22.395
John, record a message
for Ground.

16:22.498 --> 16:24.742
- Tell them the situation.
-Yes, sir.

16:33.233 --> 16:35.891
Houston, this is Odyssey-1.
John speaking.

16:36.271 --> 16:38.135
We have a situation.

16:38.238 --> 16:40.309
At some point
in the last three hours,

16:40.413 --> 16:43.381
the aircraft was struck
by an object.

16:43.485 --> 16:45.590
<i>We're not exactly sure what,</i>

16:45.694 --> 16:48.352
<i>but it dinged up the side
of the ship pretty good.</i>

16:48.455 --> 16:50.388
<i>However, we've run
a complete diagnostics,</i>

16:50.492 --> 16:52.563
<i>and there appears
to be no damage.</i>

16:53.874 --> 16:55.014
Thanks so much.

17:07.888 --> 17:09.062
Hi.

17:10.477 --> 17:11.478
Hey!

17:12.169 --> 17:13.446
What are you doing?

17:14.826 --> 17:18.347
Eh, just killing time.
Before the simulator training.

17:18.451 --> 17:21.350
- Playing this dumb game.
- Yeah? What game?

17:22.765 --> 17:24.043
Crypt Junkie.

17:25.182 --> 17:26.355
What level?

17:28.288 --> 17:30.290
The Vatican City.

17:32.637 --> 17:33.707
I'm stuck.

17:34.467 --> 17:35.675
Seriously?

17:35.778 --> 17:38.919
You can do a flat spin
maneuver in an F-14 Tomcat,

17:39.023 --> 17:41.370
but you can't make that...
that ledge?

17:42.716 --> 17:45.478
- That is the situation, yes.
- May I?

17:47.721 --> 17:48.791
Sure.

17:48.895 --> 17:50.276
It's just...

17:57.214 --> 17:58.215
<i>Level cleared.</i>

17:58.318 --> 18:00.493
My nephew taught me.
He's nine.

18:00.596 --> 18:01.735
No way!

18:01.839 --> 18:04.600
Oh! You need more XP points
before you can...

18:04.704 --> 18:05.567
I've got plenty of XP.

18:05.670 --> 18:07.224
I'm fine thanks,
I got a lot of XP.

18:07.327 --> 18:08.673
You could buy some
night-vision goggles.

18:08.777 --> 18:11.504
I don't need any goggles,
I've been to Pontiff's.

18:15.749 --> 18:20.306
I was still doing my PhD
when I started working here,

18:20.409 --> 18:24.655
and my sister jokes that
it's my longest relationship.

18:24.758 --> 18:27.451
But I wouldn't trade
this time for the world.

18:27.554 --> 18:31.317
And everyday I wake up and
I'm excited and I'm inspired.

18:31.420 --> 18:33.733
It's the most important job
you'll ever have.

18:33.836 --> 18:35.804
- Mmm-hmm.
- Yeah.

18:36.874 --> 18:38.324
Anyway, what about you?

18:38.427 --> 18:41.879
If you are chosen,
won't you miss your life here?

18:41.982 --> 18:43.605
Friends and family?

18:43.708 --> 18:45.193
No.

18:45.296 --> 18:47.919
I've always been a loner.
Only child syndrome.

18:48.023 --> 18:49.404
Okay!

18:49.507 --> 18:51.578
My father died when I was 11,

18:51.682 --> 18:53.477
and my mother eventually
moved away to Maine

18:53.580 --> 18:54.512
and we don't talk that much.

18:54.616 --> 18:57.377
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

18:58.378 --> 19:00.622
What do you think
are your chances?

19:00.725 --> 19:01.864
Pretty good.

19:03.383 --> 19:05.765
I mean, I graduated top
of my class in the Air Force,

19:05.868 --> 19:07.870
I got an accelerated degree
in aeronautics,

19:07.974 --> 19:10.804
and I never had anything
less than a perfect score

19:10.908 --> 19:12.530
in any physical or psych exam.

19:12.634 --> 19:14.808
And by the time
I set foot on Titan,

19:14.912 --> 19:16.327
I'll be 39 years old,

19:16.431 --> 19:18.571
which is the exact same age
Neil Armstrong was

19:18.674 --> 19:20.366
when he set foot on the Moon.

19:22.195 --> 19:23.817
Come on.

19:23.921 --> 19:26.303
Tell me I'm not the guy.

19:26.406 --> 19:28.132
Why do I think you had
that answer prepared?

19:28.236 --> 19:30.307
'Cause I used it
in all my interviews.

19:31.446 --> 19:34.034
Just to be clear,
we have nothing from Houston,

19:34.138 --> 19:35.967
although comms are online.

19:36.071 --> 19:37.969
We have no changes
in navigation,

19:38.073 --> 19:39.592
life support, power.

19:39.695 --> 19:41.663
What we have
is a dent in the hull

19:41.766 --> 19:44.459
that presents no real dangers
to the ship or the crew.

19:44.562 --> 19:46.012
Well, it's really too early--

19:46.115 --> 19:47.738
I see no reason at this point,

19:47.841 --> 19:51.120
to depart from the mission
or the flight path.

19:51.224 --> 19:54.020
We knew that
impacts were possible.

19:54.123 --> 19:56.609
Unlikely, but possible.

19:56.712 --> 19:58.369
We don't even know
where it came from.

19:58.473 --> 20:00.475
The ship is telling us
nothing happened.

20:00.578 --> 20:03.236
That's because the impact
represents no real danger.

20:03.340 --> 20:05.031
What if the whole system
is compromised?

20:05.134 --> 20:07.378
Nash, you just told me,

20:07.482 --> 20:09.242
the ship's given us
no evidence of that.

20:09.794 --> 20:10.968
What?

20:11.071 --> 20:14.109
The system has no evidence
of a whopping dent, either.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.352
Cap...

20:18.458 --> 20:20.667
Won't you join me, gentlemen?

20:21.289 --> 20:22.807
Take it easy, okay?

20:26.984 --> 20:28.227
You know, it occurs to me that

20:28.330 --> 20:30.298
there might be
another possibility.

20:32.265 --> 20:34.129
What if
the structural stresses

20:34.233 --> 20:35.855
on the ship aren't balanced,

20:35.958 --> 20:39.928
and they're creating...
fatigue and buckling?

20:40.031 --> 20:41.343
There's no way the design team

20:41.447 --> 20:42.724
overlooked
something like that.

20:42.827 --> 20:43.966
Design team.

20:44.898 --> 20:46.417
You mean Zoe Morgan?

20:48.971 --> 20:51.526
I mean that the design team
worked for decades.

20:51.629 --> 20:53.804
They would not have overlooked
a structural weakness.

20:53.907 --> 20:57.739
NASA lost
a $125-million Mars orbiter

20:57.842 --> 21:01.363
because they failed to convert
metric to inches correctly,

21:01.467 --> 21:02.916
you remember that?

21:03.020 --> 21:06.023
Okay, John, just say
for a second, I'm right.

21:06.126 --> 21:10.269
It is structural stress.
What are the ongoing risks?

21:10.372 --> 21:12.340
It is possible that
the dent is enough

21:12.443 --> 21:13.479
to relieve the stress.

21:13.582 --> 21:15.204
Or it could be just
the beginning,

21:15.308 --> 21:17.034
and the ship
can continue to buckle

21:17.137 --> 21:20.002
until we reach Jupiter orbit
and we attempt the slingshot,

21:20.106 --> 21:23.730
I mean, at which point
we get explosive decompression

21:23.834 --> 21:26.492
and blasted into
deep space without suits!

21:26.595 --> 21:27.769
Ah.

21:29.529 --> 21:31.531
Would that explain everything
that we've seen so far?

21:31.635 --> 21:33.533
I mean, I know you think
Zoe walks on water,

21:33.637 --> 21:35.052
but would that explain it?

21:36.709 --> 21:38.780
- Maybe.
-Good! Work on that.

21:38.883 --> 21:41.092
Until we get confirmation
of any additional risks

21:41.196 --> 21:43.060
or receive word from Ground,

21:43.163 --> 21:45.407
the mission continues
as planned.

21:45.511 --> 21:46.960
We are still
in the game, gentlemen.

21:47.064 --> 21:49.204
Let's try to keep
our heads on our shoulders.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.447
Dismissed!

22:16.162 --> 22:18.578
Let me get you a drink,
I'll tell you about it.

22:21.063 --> 22:22.030
Hi.

23:29.166 --> 23:30.685
Goddamnit, come on!

23:51.464 --> 23:52.983
Hey. Wake up.

23:55.157 --> 23:56.573
How are you feeling?

23:57.470 --> 23:59.714
- How's your head?
- It's okay.

24:00.611 --> 24:02.164
Any word from Mission Control?

24:02.268 --> 24:04.201
No. Still nothing.

24:07.100 --> 24:08.067
Listen...

24:10.207 --> 24:13.244
I don't like this situation.

24:13.831 --> 24:16.524
We need to say
if the ship is beat up.

24:17.973 --> 24:20.528
But I think hurling ourselves
into deep space

24:20.631 --> 24:23.496
at 33,000 miles per hour
on a defective ship

24:23.600 --> 24:26.395
is a very bad idea.

24:26.499 --> 24:28.397
We can't reach Titan
without the slingshot.

24:28.501 --> 24:29.882
Forget Titan!

24:30.503 --> 24:32.988
We abort the mission.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.096
That's the second time
it's happened.

24:38.580 --> 24:40.824
Fucking second time
it's happened.

24:44.724 --> 24:47.037
Diagnostics show
no sign of any power failure.

24:47.140 --> 24:48.279
That's just great!

24:48.383 --> 24:51.386
There is a discrepancy between
what the ship is telling us,

24:51.490 --> 24:52.939
and what we are seeing
with our own eyes.

24:53.043 --> 24:55.424
You don't see anything
that I don't see.

24:55.528 --> 24:56.909
I understand.

24:59.221 --> 25:01.845
<i>Nash! John!
I need you in the galley.</i>

25:08.161 --> 25:09.508
Have a seat, gentlemen.

25:12.683 --> 25:14.858
So, Nash, let's um...

25:14.961 --> 25:17.170
Let's walk through
your suggestion back there.

25:18.275 --> 25:19.690
Suppose we decide to abort,

25:19.794 --> 25:22.072
make a U-turn
and head back to Earth.

25:22.175 --> 25:24.315
You were listening
to our conversation.

25:24.419 --> 25:25.420
Let's say three days later,

25:25.524 --> 25:27.318
we finally hear
from Mission Control.

25:28.043 --> 25:31.115
They blame the breakdown
in communication

25:31.219 --> 25:32.634
on solar weather.

25:32.738 --> 25:33.980
Furthermore, they tell us that

25:34.084 --> 25:37.018
there is absolutely nothing
wrong with the ship.

25:37.121 --> 25:38.364
Oops!

25:38.951 --> 25:41.332
Now, we have to explain
to the world

25:41.436 --> 25:42.851
that we shit the bed.

25:42.955 --> 25:45.095
And we're on our way home.

25:45.198 --> 25:48.581
- They can relaunch.
- On whose dime? Yours?

25:50.272 --> 25:51.860
Look.

25:51.964 --> 25:54.725
In 90 days,
we are going to be facing

25:54.829 --> 25:56.624
one of the most
difficult moments

25:56.727 --> 25:58.418
of the entire mission.

25:58.522 --> 26:01.974
The gravity assist will be
our ultimate do-or-die moment.

26:02.768 --> 26:06.323
We need to work as a team.

26:07.669 --> 26:09.913
Are we in agreement with that?

26:10.534 --> 26:12.122
Yeah. 100%.

26:13.468 --> 26:14.607
Nash?

26:17.783 --> 26:20.337
- Mmm-hmm.
- Good.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.201
We are wasting resources, gentlemen.

26:23.236 --> 26:24.755
It's time we hit the pad.

26:31.590 --> 26:33.108
Listen, um...

26:33.212 --> 26:34.627
Oh, my God,
you don't need to say it.

26:34.731 --> 26:35.697
No, no, no.

26:35.801 --> 26:37.423
We both know
what's at stake here.

26:37.526 --> 26:38.976
You're up for Titan.

26:39.080 --> 26:40.633
Nothing can get
in the way of that.

26:40.737 --> 26:43.049
I'm on the Odyssey team
and my work comes first.

26:43.705 --> 26:44.913
- So...
- Okay.

26:45.017 --> 26:46.708
Yeah, and if we see
each other at work,

26:46.812 --> 26:48.399
we're colleagues
and nothing more.

26:48.503 --> 26:49.884
- Of course.
- Yeah.

26:51.782 --> 26:53.094
Nothing more.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.685
I think this was
such a bad idea.

26:57.788 --> 26:59.687
For all kinds of reasons.

26:59.790 --> 27:01.689
Yeah, it was a bad idea.

27:05.244 --> 27:06.832
Well executed though,
wasn't it?

27:07.487 --> 27:09.317
Well, yeah.

27:18.602 --> 27:21.294
90-day hibernation cycle, right?

27:22.502 --> 27:23.676
What?

27:25.609 --> 27:28.888
Set yours for 89
days and 12 hours.

27:30.545 --> 27:32.823
I have a plan.

27:32.927 --> 27:36.240
When we reach Jupiter orbit,
we perform the slingshot...

27:36.931 --> 27:39.174
in the opposite direction.

27:39.278 --> 27:40.589
Towards Earth.

27:40.693 --> 27:43.420
Look at it. I did the math.

27:43.523 --> 27:45.008
Also, given the damage
to the hull,

27:45.111 --> 27:48.874
I'm not comfortable
firing the thrusters.

27:48.977 --> 27:51.773
Hey! Gravity assist alone will
still get us back to Earth

27:51.877 --> 27:54.500
a hell of a lot faster.

27:54.603 --> 27:56.329
- It's insane.
- It's a plan!

27:56.433 --> 27:58.953
John! I can't do it by myself.

27:59.056 --> 28:00.230
You heard
what the captain said.

28:00.333 --> 28:01.472
We need to work as a team.

28:01.576 --> 28:05.269
We both know that's bullshit!
He's gonna get us all killed!

28:06.477 --> 28:08.410
You're losing your grip.

28:08.514 --> 28:11.241
I'm only talking
about 12 hours.

28:11.344 --> 28:12.794
No, you're not.

28:13.795 --> 28:15.417
You're talking about a mutiny.

28:15.521 --> 28:16.453
What?

28:35.023 --> 28:36.887
You ever hear of
Tor Ice Station?

28:40.097 --> 28:42.272
I can't get this story
out of my head.

28:47.001 --> 28:50.107
It's a scientific facility
in Antarctica.

28:51.246 --> 28:53.732
So, 12-person teams
would work for half a year

28:53.835 --> 28:56.976
in complete isolation,
no way in or out.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.875
Three months
into an assignment,

28:58.978 --> 29:00.808
the scientists
at Tor discovered

29:00.911 --> 29:02.810
a crack along
the Arctic ice shelf

29:02.913 --> 29:05.226
that was making its way
towards the station.

29:07.159 --> 29:08.954
They knew that
if they didn't leave,

29:09.057 --> 29:10.369
they were all gonna die.

29:12.060 --> 29:14.028
Well, the man in charge,

29:15.892 --> 29:19.033
a Navy commander,
he had a different opinion.

29:20.413 --> 29:21.932
Despite the threat,

29:22.864 --> 29:26.212
he held the scientists
at gunpoint,

29:26.316 --> 29:28.974
threatened to shoot anyone
who tries to leave.

29:31.597 --> 29:33.081
When they finally recovered

29:33.185 --> 29:35.359
the bodies from
the frozen sea,

29:36.084 --> 29:38.086
there were only 11 men.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.848
The Commander was missing.

29:42.608 --> 29:45.473
Autopsies revealed that
the scientists hadn't died

29:45.576 --> 29:47.544
from drowning or hypothermia.

29:50.789 --> 29:53.032
Gunshot wounds to the head.

29:54.137 --> 29:56.725
It was eleven against one,

29:56.829 --> 29:58.382
but the scientists
didn't even try

29:58.486 --> 29:59.625
to overpower the commander,

29:59.728 --> 30:01.075
they were too weak.

30:01.178 --> 30:03.491
And it cost them their lives.

30:05.942 --> 30:07.806
Do you want to live or die?

30:08.392 --> 30:09.393
Huh?

30:11.119 --> 30:13.259
'Cause it's really
that simple.

30:16.918 --> 30:20.094
- You have to pick a side.
- Okay!

30:21.681 --> 30:23.062
Okay.

30:26.583 --> 30:27.756
If we wake up

30:27.860 --> 30:29.897
and the ship shows no further
evidence of being damaged,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.106
then we stick
to the original flight plan.

30:36.524 --> 30:37.490
All right.

30:39.941 --> 30:41.115
I'm in.

30:44.394 --> 30:46.637
I'm gonna reset
your sleeping cycle right now.

30:48.156 --> 30:50.779
I need your passcode.

30:50.883 --> 30:53.299
[ON RADIO] <i>...as fear
spreads across the region.</i>

30:53.403 --> 30:56.164
<i>As you know, there was
also an 8.4 earthquake</i>

30:56.268 --> 30:58.339
<i>in New Mexico
earlier this month...</i>

30:58.442 --> 31:01.066
- Hey you, what're you making?
- Hi.

31:01.169 --> 31:02.170
Hmm?

31:04.966 --> 31:07.106
<i>So we all know
that Titan's surface</i>

31:07.210 --> 31:09.108
is rich with hydrocarbon.

31:09.212 --> 31:11.421
But here's the problem.

31:11.524 --> 31:14.769
To make the C2H2 work as fuel,
we need oxygen,

31:14.873 --> 31:16.012
which is in short supply.

31:16.115 --> 31:18.324
But back in '28,
the Titan Saturn mission

31:18.428 --> 31:21.155
identified potential oxygen
under the ice shell.

31:21.258 --> 31:23.674
Folks, there is our oxygen.

31:23.778 --> 31:27.471
To reach it, we need to drill
through the ice shell...

31:27.575 --> 31:28.679
Yes. Yes, Gale?

31:28.783 --> 31:32.442
What happens if there is no
oxygen under the lithosphere?

31:32.545 --> 31:34.616
Or if it's so deep,
we can't reach it?

31:34.720 --> 31:37.654
Well, I... I think
we'll know the answer to that.

31:37.757 --> 31:40.553
You won't have enough fuel
for the journey home.

31:43.798 --> 31:44.972
Um...

31:46.387 --> 31:48.147
<i>But our data...</i>

31:48.251 --> 31:49.459
<i>Hello, John.</i>

31:49.562 --> 31:51.495
We're very confident that

31:51.599 --> 31:54.429
there's a viable oxygen plant
on Titan to combine...

31:54.533 --> 31:55.844
<i>You are aboard</i>

31:55.948 --> 31:57.398
<i>the spacecraft Odyssey-1,</i>

31:57.501 --> 31:58.744
<i>bound for Titan.</i>

31:58.847 --> 32:02.161
<i>We all understand
that these are the risks.</i>

32:02.265 --> 32:04.370
<i>Please be careful.</i>

32:04.474 --> 32:07.028
<i>The drugs used
to induce hibernation</i>

32:07.132 --> 32:09.720
<i>can produce mild side-effects,</i>

32:09.824 --> 32:12.240
<i>including confusion,</i>

32:12.620 --> 32:13.759
<i>nausea,</i>

32:13.862 --> 32:17.452
<i>dizziness and disorientation.</i>

32:17.556 --> 32:22.216
<i>You are 1 year,
2 months, 29 days</i>

32:22.319 --> 32:25.150
<i>and 12 hours
into your mission.</i>

32:53.523 --> 32:54.351
Hey, John.

32:54.455 --> 32:56.043
I'm just getting
everything in order.

32:56.146 --> 32:58.079
The math is in the computer.

32:59.322 --> 33:01.082
We'll be ready to roll
within the hour.

33:01.186 --> 33:03.188
Is hibernation
affecting you at all?

33:03.774 --> 33:04.741
Are you kidding me?

33:04.844 --> 33:08.227
I feel like hammered shit
every time we wake up.

33:08.814 --> 33:10.436
I saw Zoe.

33:13.060 --> 33:14.544
Right here, on this ship.

33:18.927 --> 33:22.172
You know it wasn't her, right?

33:22.276 --> 33:24.519
Unless she snuck on board
during the launch,

33:24.623 --> 33:27.108
been hiding in the ship's
crawlspace this whole time!

33:27.212 --> 33:28.558
That's not what I'm saying!

33:28.661 --> 33:31.043
I'm saying
I'm not thinking straight.

33:31.147 --> 33:33.459
I'm saying I'm seeing things
that aren't there.

33:35.289 --> 33:36.669
I know you miss her.

33:37.325 --> 33:39.189
It all seemed so real.

33:39.293 --> 33:40.811
We're going home.

33:42.779 --> 33:44.746
You're gonna see her again.
Right, bud?

33:44.850 --> 33:46.610
I know. Yeah.

33:47.542 --> 33:48.819
I get it.

33:48.923 --> 33:50.235
Let's go home.

33:55.343 --> 33:57.345
Nothing from Houston,
I take it?

33:58.588 --> 33:59.727
No.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.350
I've got something
to show you. Come here.

34:02.454 --> 34:03.420
Come here.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.222
Wow.

34:17.434 --> 34:19.471
Only six people
have been this close

34:19.574 --> 34:20.541
to the gas giant.

34:21.024 --> 34:22.370
It's incredible.

34:23.958 --> 34:26.202
Make it eight people now.

34:26.305 --> 34:28.687
Nine,
if you count the captain.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.691
Won't be long before
it's in our rear view,

34:32.794 --> 34:34.693
so enjoy it while you can.

34:34.796 --> 34:36.004
Yeah.

34:36.108 --> 34:39.215
Actually, I want to talk
to you about that, Nash.

34:39.318 --> 34:42.701
I don't think we should go
behind the captain's back.

34:46.291 --> 34:48.086
John, we went over this.

34:49.121 --> 34:50.433
Despite the hull event,

34:50.536 --> 34:53.160
guidance, artificial gravity,
accelerometers,

34:53.263 --> 34:55.369
all turning up clean?

34:55.472 --> 34:57.060
The ship's diagnostics
isn't working.

34:57.164 --> 34:58.303
Well, I don't know.

34:58.406 --> 34:59.821
That's like saying
I lost my keys

34:59.925 --> 35:02.790
because sneaky,
invisible gremlins took them.

35:03.653 --> 35:04.585
What?

35:06.069 --> 35:07.105
- What?
- I...

35:07.208 --> 35:09.107
I can't find any evidence
of the gremlins.

35:09.210 --> 35:10.867
It just proves
how sneaky they are.

35:10.970 --> 35:13.076
There's no way to disprove
your theory, it doesn't work.

35:15.216 --> 35:16.355
Fuck you.

35:19.876 --> 35:21.153
Fuck you!

35:21.257 --> 35:23.431
I have a doctorate
in astrophysics from Caltech!

35:23.535 --> 35:24.812
-"Sneaky gremlins"?
- Doesn't matter.

35:24.915 --> 35:26.952
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- You know what I'm saying!

35:27.055 --> 35:28.609
There's nothing wrong
with the ship.

35:28.712 --> 35:30.438
I ran through this
a thousand different ways!

35:30.542 --> 35:32.544
Can't find anything
wrong with the ship.

35:32.647 --> 35:35.236
The only option is
to abort the mission!

35:35.340 --> 35:37.031
That's gonna be a challenge,

35:37.135 --> 35:39.206
since we're all
on the same spacecraft.

35:42.174 --> 35:44.556
Oh, I'm sorry, was I not
invited to this party?

35:48.007 --> 35:48.939
Nash.

35:50.009 --> 35:51.873
I want you to go
check the rations.

35:51.977 --> 35:53.151
Against the ship's inventory.

35:53.254 --> 35:54.704
See how much
we've consumed so far.

35:54.807 --> 35:56.464
No, no.
I'm not leaving this room.

35:58.328 --> 35:59.605
You know, for a second there,

35:59.709 --> 36:03.333
it almost sounded like
you were refusing an order.

36:04.196 --> 36:05.335
Were you?

36:05.956 --> 36:07.579
Refusing an order?

36:28.013 --> 36:29.532
Let me ask you something,
John.

36:29.635 --> 36:30.912
Sure.

36:31.016 --> 36:32.224
Are we friends?

36:33.881 --> 36:35.193
Yes.

36:35.296 --> 36:36.953
I'd like to think
we're friends.

36:37.643 --> 36:38.679
Absolutely.

36:38.782 --> 36:40.853
Aw, that's great!

36:40.957 --> 36:43.891
I got a friend out here.

36:43.994 --> 36:45.720
Join me for a drink,
all right?

36:48.758 --> 36:50.277
Sit down.

36:50.380 --> 36:52.244
Let's enjoy
this together, huh?

36:53.383 --> 36:54.695
Look at that.

36:56.697 --> 36:57.732
Breathtaking.

37:06.569 --> 37:07.604
<i>Slainte.</i>

37:13.023 --> 37:14.715
- You all right?
- No!

37:16.475 --> 37:18.443
- What's that?
- Moonshine.

37:18.995 --> 37:20.652
My own recipe.

37:20.755 --> 37:23.206
What's the secret ingredient?
Windex?

37:23.310 --> 37:24.518
How'd you know?

37:28.936 --> 37:29.971
Listen,

37:31.387 --> 37:34.942
if any of us
find conclusive evidence

37:35.045 --> 37:38.497
that there's a major problem
on board Odyssey,

37:38.601 --> 37:40.465
I'll cancel the mission,
you know that.

37:40.568 --> 37:43.433
- Don't you?
- Yeah. I do.

37:43.537 --> 37:45.711
My greater concern right now

37:45.815 --> 37:49.025
is the growing conflict
between me and...

37:49.922 --> 37:50.992
Puss in Boots out there.

37:52.200 --> 37:54.168
You need to stay
out of it, John.

37:54.272 --> 37:57.861
If you pick a side, it will
only unbalance the situation.

37:59.311 --> 38:00.416
Does that make sense?

38:01.313 --> 38:02.694
Yeah, it does.

38:03.626 --> 38:05.317
- Makes sense.
- Good.

38:05.731 --> 38:06.732
Right.

38:10.011 --> 38:12.566
You know, the drugs they use
to induce hibernation

38:12.669 --> 38:15.569
are extremely potent
and the side effects

38:15.672 --> 38:18.296
can affect people
in all kinds of ways.

38:18.399 --> 38:21.022
Some show strong
physical symptoms.

38:21.126 --> 38:23.749
For other people,
it's more mental.

38:24.647 --> 38:27.028
Loss of awareness, focus,

38:27.822 --> 38:29.099
memory decrements,

38:29.790 --> 38:31.032
paranoia.

38:31.792 --> 38:33.587
Sound like anyone you know?

38:38.005 --> 38:39.075
- Yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

38:40.248 --> 38:41.422
Okay.

38:42.216 --> 38:43.597
So what do you propose we do?

38:43.700 --> 38:45.875
I'll recommend that
Nash reduce his dose.

38:45.978 --> 38:46.772
Okay.

38:46.876 --> 38:48.222
I'll also adjust
his work schedule,

38:48.326 --> 38:51.018
so he has a lot less downtime
for his mind to wander.

38:51.121 --> 38:52.122
Great.

38:52.226 --> 38:55.712
Right now, I want all
our focus on the slingshot.

38:59.371 --> 39:05.757
<i>Oh, I'm just a soul
whose intentions are good</i>

39:05.860 --> 39:09.864
<i>Oh Lord, please don't
let me be misund--</i>

39:27.123 --> 39:28.331
What's going on?

39:28.435 --> 39:29.539
John.

39:31.886 --> 39:34.372
He can't perform
the slingshot on his own.

39:34.475 --> 39:35.683
As long as we
stick together...

39:35.787 --> 39:40.516
- Nash, just take it easy.
- What? You're with him?

39:40.619 --> 39:43.657
I see no evidence
of any further issues.

39:43.760 --> 39:46.142
I see no further evidence
that we're not fucked!

39:46.245 --> 39:47.523
We're not fucked.

39:50.629 --> 39:52.666
There's no compelling reason
to abort.

39:52.769 --> 39:54.219
There's no threat
to our survival.

39:54.322 --> 39:55.462
He told you to say that.

39:55.565 --> 39:56.911
There's no threat
to the mission.

39:57.015 --> 39:58.396
He told you to say that!

39:58.499 --> 39:59.431
I'm not going
to abort, Nash.

39:59.535 --> 40:01.985
I won't participate in this!
I won't!

40:02.917 --> 40:04.747
Odyssey is broken!

40:04.850 --> 40:06.507
Everything around us
is screaming,

40:06.611 --> 40:07.991
"Turn the fuck around!",

40:08.095 --> 40:10.787
and you're about to blast us
even further into space!

40:11.374 --> 40:12.651
John.

40:12.755 --> 40:14.066
Is it possible for us
to perform

40:14.170 --> 40:15.861
the slingshot without Nash?

40:19.486 --> 40:20.866
Yes, we can.

40:20.970 --> 40:24.111
- The math is in the computer.
- You heard that, Nash?

40:24.214 --> 40:25.837
The math's in the computer.

40:29.150 --> 40:30.151
And rest assured,

40:30.255 --> 40:32.568
when we reestablish
communications with Houston,

40:32.671 --> 40:34.949
I'm giving them a full report
on your insubordination.

40:35.053 --> 40:36.054
Now clear out!

40:41.369 --> 40:43.510
- He's sick.
- I know, John.

40:44.890 --> 40:45.891
I'm good.

40:47.341 --> 40:48.376
Enjoy your meal.

40:48.480 --> 40:49.861
Don't forget to hydrate.

40:51.207 --> 40:52.691
See you on the bridge, John.

43:21.944 --> 43:24.394
<i>John? It's time
we prepared for the slingshot.</i>

43:30.746 --> 43:31.885
John.

43:34.784 --> 43:36.752
You don't have to do this.

43:38.374 --> 43:40.410
I'm begging you. It's suicide.

43:43.310 --> 43:45.139
<i>John! This is it!</i>

43:46.451 --> 43:48.384
Captain, I'll be right there.

43:48.487 --> 43:49.419
No, John...

43:50.213 --> 43:52.008
John, John, John...

43:52.871 --> 43:55.046
You're sending us all to die!

43:56.392 --> 43:58.670
Please, John! Please!

43:59.395 --> 44:00.879
John!

44:00.983 --> 44:03.710
You're sending us all to die!

44:04.469 --> 44:05.953
John!

44:08.369 --> 44:11.062
Do you know why
moths fly into the light?

44:11.925 --> 44:15.204
Yeah. It has to do
with navigation, doesn't it?

44:15.307 --> 44:18.103
They fly relative
to a light source.

44:18.207 --> 44:19.173
Usually the moon.

44:19.277 --> 44:22.245
You know,
there's another theory.

44:22.349 --> 44:25.421
A little different.
So, when a moth is in danger,

44:25.524 --> 44:28.804
the best escape-route
tends to be towards the light.

44:28.907 --> 44:31.807
And usually that's upwards.

44:32.600 --> 44:33.878
And it makes sense, right?

44:33.981 --> 44:35.983
I mean,
what's the alternative?

44:37.985 --> 44:39.953
Down towards darkness?

44:41.299 --> 44:42.852
So...

44:42.956 --> 44:46.891
Flying into the light
is a survival instinct.

44:49.583 --> 44:50.584
But on the other hand,

44:50.688 --> 44:52.413
moths also live
in dark cupboards,

44:52.517 --> 44:54.243
and they eat cardigans, so...

44:54.346 --> 44:56.486
I just love how much
you know about moths.

45:04.667 --> 45:07.843
We only get one shot at this.

45:07.946 --> 45:11.018
Entering Jupiter's orbit
in 30 seconds.

45:14.642 --> 45:16.472
Standby with the thrusters.

45:16.575 --> 45:17.887
Copy.

45:20.614 --> 45:21.926
Thrusters at 0%.

45:22.029 --> 45:23.099
Hit the mark,

45:23.203 --> 45:25.274
then cut the thrusters
at the precise moment,

45:25.377 --> 45:26.447
and we'll be on track.

45:26.551 --> 45:28.587
And if you miss...

45:28.691 --> 45:30.451
It's been nice
knowing you, gentlemen.

45:30.555 --> 45:32.246
Jesus Christ...

45:33.489 --> 45:34.732
John, you're up.

45:34.835 --> 45:36.043
Yes, sir.

45:39.771 --> 45:43.741
In ten, nine...

45:44.914 --> 45:46.744
John, you got it? Six...

45:46.847 --> 45:48.297
Damn it!
Come on, come on.

45:48.400 --> 45:50.230
Five. You got it?

45:52.059 --> 45:54.199
-I got it.
- Three.

45:54.924 --> 45:57.720
Two, one...

45:57.824 --> 45:59.342
- John!
-Thruster 1.

46:01.517 --> 46:03.001
Thruster 2.

46:04.692 --> 46:05.935
Third thruster.

46:06.867 --> 46:08.904
All thrusters
at full capacity.

46:09.007 --> 46:10.457
Hit it!

46:10.560 --> 46:11.561
We're gonna do this!

46:18.499 --> 46:21.468
<i>Warning! System overload.</i>

46:21.571 --> 46:24.091
Jesus Christ! Now?

46:25.921 --> 46:29.131
Negative.
That's a negative, John. Hold!

46:33.583 --> 46:36.310
We're all gonna die,
we're all gonna die,

46:36.414 --> 46:38.105
we're all gonna die!

46:38.209 --> 46:39.866
Now?
<i>Warning!</i>

46:39.969 --> 46:42.178
Hold! Hold!

46:42.627 --> 46:43.662
Hold!

46:43.766 --> 46:45.216
Now!

46:47.114 --> 46:48.944
Thrusters winding down.

46:49.047 --> 46:51.015
Steady...

46:52.016 --> 46:53.362
Thrusters at 10%.

46:54.915 --> 46:56.606
Thrusters at zero.

46:56.710 --> 46:58.470
What's our trajectory?

47:01.784 --> 47:03.199
On course.

47:04.649 --> 47:06.582
On course!

47:06.685 --> 47:07.997
We did it!

47:08.101 --> 47:09.412
Outstanding!

47:09.723 --> 47:11.207
All right!

47:11.311 --> 47:13.934
<i>Slingshot
maneuver accomplished.</i>

47:16.109 --> 47:21.562
Listen, gentlemen,
we are on our way to Titan!

47:24.324 --> 47:26.222
Rest in peace.

48:33.013 --> 48:34.394
Okay.

49:19.680 --> 49:20.716
<i>John!</i>

49:23.926 --> 49:25.479
Holy shit!

49:27.481 --> 49:30.933
Is anyone using
the UHF/VHF channel right now?

49:31.037 --> 49:32.383
<i>Not me, Johnny.</i>

49:32.486 --> 49:34.419
I'd like you
to hear something.

49:36.145 --> 49:37.940
You must have
hit the button

49:38.044 --> 49:39.631
on one of the other radios.

49:39.735 --> 49:41.012
Or you were hearing an echo.

49:41.116 --> 49:43.256
If there was an echo,
what was it bouncing off of?

49:43.359 --> 49:45.154
These radios have
a 70-mile range,

49:45.258 --> 49:46.914
so it's gotta bounce off
something very big

49:47.018 --> 49:48.123
or very close.

49:48.226 --> 49:50.470
Well,
that's simple enough to check.

49:50.573 --> 49:53.162
Radar doesn't show anything
for a thousand miles.

49:53.266 --> 49:55.509
You hit the wrong button
or you dozed off.

49:55.613 --> 49:56.683
I didn't doze off.

49:56.786 --> 50:00.031
So it's just another
one of your fantasies.

50:00.135 --> 50:02.102
You know, for a guy who's
afraid of his own shadow,

50:02.206 --> 50:03.448
you don't seem very concerned.

50:03.552 --> 50:05.554
I gotta say
I'm with Nash on this, John.

50:05.657 --> 50:07.487
Maybe you are
a little bit fuzzy.

50:07.590 --> 50:08.488
Fuzzy?

50:08.591 --> 50:10.386
- I'm telling you what I heard.
-Okay.

50:10.490 --> 50:14.218
It's high time we made
preparations for hibernation.

50:15.943 --> 50:17.359
Move the fuck out.

50:25.022 --> 50:26.299
You need something?

50:35.480 --> 50:36.481
I'm good.

50:47.113 --> 50:49.460
What you waiting for?
Answer it.

50:54.465 --> 50:55.259
Hello?

50:55.362 --> 50:57.640
<i>Hey, John. It's Sam Napier.</i>

50:57.744 --> 50:58.607
Yes, sir?

50:58.710 --> 51:01.575
<i>Can you, um,
come down to my office?</i>

51:01.679 --> 51:03.853
<i>I have some good news.</i>

51:03.957 --> 51:05.407
<i>Okay, thank you very much.</i>

51:21.008 --> 51:22.009
Hey!

51:22.113 --> 51:23.045
- Hey.
- Where've you been?

51:23.149 --> 51:24.805
I've been trying
to call you all day.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.256
Well...

51:29.914 --> 51:31.260
You...

51:31.364 --> 51:33.435
You do know. Right?

51:33.538 --> 51:35.851
Yes, I know. Congratulations.

51:39.406 --> 51:41.615
Zoe, what's going on?

51:41.719 --> 51:43.893
We had this agreement
when we started it,

51:43.997 --> 51:46.310
that our work comes first.

51:47.069 --> 51:48.519
So what's changed?

51:50.141 --> 51:51.384
I love you.

51:52.178 --> 51:54.041
Okay, thank you.
I'm flattered.

51:54.145 --> 51:56.320
Oh, my God.

51:56.423 --> 51:58.943
- Don't fucking do that.
- What do you want me to say?

51:59.046 --> 52:00.841
Well, don't you feel anything?

52:03.292 --> 52:05.122
Yes, I feel something.

52:06.330 --> 52:08.504
What-- Then what do you feel?

52:12.750 --> 52:13.923
John, tell me.

52:16.063 --> 52:18.411
- I...
- John! Tell me!

52:19.550 --> 52:21.655
I feel like
this is bigger than us.

52:29.007 --> 52:30.630
I really didn't
want it to be you.

52:34.806 --> 52:35.773
What?

52:36.636 --> 52:37.844
I'm sorry.

52:37.947 --> 52:39.570
How could you say that?

52:40.018 --> 52:41.330
I'm sorry.

52:41.434 --> 52:44.264
You of all people! You know
how important this is to me!

52:44.368 --> 52:46.404
How could you say that to me?

52:48.510 --> 52:50.443
I didn't want it to be you.

52:50.926 --> 52:51.892
Yes...

53:00.591 --> 53:03.456
I don't think that there's
anything left to say then.

53:05.941 --> 53:06.942
John!

53:45.463 --> 53:47.224
Oh, god, Zoe...

54:11.903 --> 54:14.354
<i>You have reached five miles.</i>

54:14.458 --> 54:16.253
<i>Congratulations.</i>

54:52.634 --> 54:53.945
Oh, Zoe!

54:56.983 --> 54:59.641
It's just in your head.
It's just in your head.

55:01.228 --> 55:02.402
John.

55:03.472 --> 55:05.509
- You all right?
- Yeah.

55:06.199 --> 55:07.511
I was running.

55:08.650 --> 55:10.514
Nash found something
in the reactor room.

55:10.617 --> 55:12.516
He's gonna need
your assistance right away.

55:12.964 --> 55:13.724
Yeah.

55:13.827 --> 55:15.622
Are you sure you're all right?

55:15.726 --> 55:18.591
- Nothing you need to tell me?
- I'm fine.

55:18.694 --> 55:20.351
Listen, if you're struggling,
you can talk--

55:20.455 --> 55:23.458
I wanna say I don't feel well!
I don't feel well!

55:23.561 --> 55:25.667
The fucking hibernation
is torture!

55:31.811 --> 55:34.434
I can manage it.
I'm all right. I'm fine.

55:35.918 --> 55:36.885
Okay.

55:39.543 --> 55:41.372
She's not here, you know.

55:43.512 --> 55:46.066
- What?
- Zoe.

55:46.170 --> 55:48.379
She is not here on this ship.

55:49.484 --> 55:50.830
I know that.

55:51.313 --> 55:52.487
Mmm-hmm.

56:06.984 --> 56:08.503
What's going on?

56:08.606 --> 56:11.575
Reactor output's
starting to escalate.

56:11.678 --> 56:14.440
I mean, it's minor, but...

56:14.543 --> 56:17.443
if it gets worse, it could be
a problem, you know?

56:17.546 --> 56:19.859
Does it have anything
to do with the damaged hull?

56:19.962 --> 56:21.378
Difficult to say.

56:21.481 --> 56:24.381
But if the reactor
goes offline,

56:24.484 --> 56:26.244
we'll be down to solar
and batteries,

56:26.348 --> 56:28.143
and that's not
nearly enough juice

56:28.246 --> 56:30.007
to keep Odyssey spaceworthy.

56:31.318 --> 56:32.492
- Okay.
- Yeah.

56:32.596 --> 56:34.494
What do you need me to do?

56:35.495 --> 56:37.739
I'm feeling a little punchy.

56:37.842 --> 56:38.705
You know.

56:38.809 --> 56:41.259
Just I'm having a hard time.

56:41.363 --> 56:42.951
I can't show this
to the captain

56:43.054 --> 56:44.918
unless the numbers add up.

56:47.473 --> 56:50.130
Check my numbers. Please.

56:51.546 --> 56:53.513
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

56:53.617 --> 56:55.515
I'll look into
these over, Nash?

56:55.619 --> 56:57.206
I need you
to do something for me.

56:57.310 --> 56:58.449
Yeah.

56:59.899 --> 57:02.177
How did the captain
know about Zoe?

57:04.731 --> 57:05.698
Well, everybody knew.

57:05.801 --> 57:07.527
Your relationship
was no secret.

57:07.631 --> 57:08.666
That's not what I mean.

57:08.770 --> 57:11.013
How did the captain
know that...

57:12.187 --> 57:13.878
I'd seen her on the ship?

57:17.434 --> 57:18.814
I told you.

57:20.713 --> 57:22.646
- You told him?
- No.

57:23.440 --> 57:24.820
I told you.

57:24.924 --> 57:27.098
- You told him.
- I don't think I did.

57:27.202 --> 57:28.686
You don't think you did?

57:29.756 --> 57:30.964
I...

57:32.069 --> 57:32.863
Did you--

57:32.966 --> 57:35.417
Maybe I told him.
I don't know.

57:35.521 --> 57:36.556
I can't remember.

57:36.660 --> 57:39.421
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

57:39.525 --> 57:41.665
I can't remember
my parents' names.

57:41.768 --> 57:43.805
I don't even remember
what they look like.

57:46.911 --> 57:49.258
It's just the side-effects
from the drugs.

57:52.089 --> 57:53.470
Okay?

57:53.573 --> 57:55.817
Side-effects?
That's all it is?

57:55.920 --> 57:56.887
Yes.

57:58.164 --> 58:01.581
You've been
forgetting things, too.

58:01.685 --> 58:04.688
You couldn't remember
Zoe's last name.

58:07.656 --> 58:09.589
What else have you forgotten?

58:13.662 --> 58:15.215
Have you forgotten...

58:15.837 --> 58:17.632
how her skin feels like?

58:21.705 --> 58:22.844
How she smells?

58:24.880 --> 58:27.780
Maybe she's forgotten you.

58:27.883 --> 58:30.921
Do you really think she hasn't
met someone by now?

58:31.784 --> 58:32.888
Be careful, Nash.

58:32.992 --> 58:35.650
Zoe moved on,
she met a new man.

58:35.753 --> 58:37.168
A man who appreciates her,

58:37.272 --> 58:39.101
who is committed to her
without hesitation,

58:39.205 --> 58:40.965
a man who is everything
you're not!

58:43.865 --> 58:44.969
Stop it!

58:48.663 --> 58:50.043
We can still go back

58:50.147 --> 58:52.218
if we turn the ship
around right now.

58:52.321 --> 58:54.496
- Stop it!
- I want to go home!

58:54.600 --> 58:56.671
We can't turn around!
Be quiet!

58:56.774 --> 58:58.604
Be quiet!
We're not going home!

58:58.707 --> 59:00.433
Stop talking! Stop it!

59:00.537 --> 59:02.331
- You can--
- Stop!

59:02.435 --> 59:04.161
We're not going home!

59:04.264 --> 59:05.749
Be quiet!

59:11.409 --> 59:13.066
We just need
to show the captain

59:13.170 --> 59:14.792
the reactor's numbers.

59:14.896 --> 59:16.622
There aren't any numbers.

59:16.725 --> 59:19.935
'Cause you've been putting
data into a dead screen.

59:28.012 --> 59:30.083
<i>Nash, John!
I need you on the bridge.</i>

59:32.327 --> 59:33.880
Tor Ice Station.

59:35.641 --> 59:37.332
Remember what I told you.

59:44.235 --> 59:45.858
Have a seat, both of you.

59:54.107 --> 59:56.800
Nash, what are your findings
on the reactor?

59:57.628 --> 59:59.975
Still checking the numbers.

01:00:00.079 --> 01:00:01.598
Something is...

01:00:02.219 --> 01:00:03.254
definitely not right.

01:00:03.358 --> 01:00:06.499
Output's dipped as low as 20%.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:09.226
I ran some of my own tests
from up here,

01:00:09.329 --> 01:00:11.400
and the data showed
similar findings. John?

01:00:13.092 --> 01:00:14.403
Any thoughts?

01:00:14.507 --> 01:00:17.717
I haven't had a chance to
review the findings yet, sir.

01:00:17.821 --> 01:00:20.755
- Gut feelings then?
- Uh... Gut feeling?

01:00:23.274 --> 01:00:24.759
Um...

01:00:24.862 --> 01:00:25.898
I don't have a gut feeling.

01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:27.485
I'll have to sit down
with Nash

01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:28.728
and look through his numbers.

01:00:28.832 --> 01:00:29.729
Take a look at the screens.

01:00:29.833 --> 01:00:31.800
You can see that
Nash is correct.

01:00:31.904 --> 01:00:35.148
We're experiencing
a 20% dip in power.

01:00:35.252 --> 01:00:36.356
That's a major concern.

01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:39.187
If we can't solve the issue,
we may not make it to Titan.

01:00:39.946 --> 01:00:42.052
And that's not the full story.

01:00:42.155 --> 01:00:44.848
Apparently someone issued
a low-level command

01:00:44.951 --> 01:00:46.228
to the reactor subsystem

01:00:46.332 --> 01:00:48.610
which is causing
these power abnormalities.

01:00:48.714 --> 01:00:50.819
Guess whose passcode was used?

01:01:00.553 --> 01:01:01.727
It wasn't mine.

01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:03.625
It was your passcode, John.

01:01:03.729 --> 01:01:05.351
- Captain, that's impossible.
-But...

01:01:05.454 --> 01:01:08.181
I don't think you had anything
to do with it.

01:01:10.632 --> 01:01:12.358
You did give Nash
your passcode

01:01:12.461 --> 01:01:14.601
when he reprogrammed your
sleep chamber, did you not?

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:16.569
- Cap...
-No.

01:01:16.673 --> 01:01:18.329
I don't know his passcode.

01:01:20.607 --> 01:01:22.920
I barely remember my own name!

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:25.889
I'm innocent.

01:01:26.786 --> 01:01:29.686
This amounts to...

01:01:29.789 --> 01:01:33.344
sabotage, and it puts me...

01:01:34.449 --> 01:01:38.004
in a very difficult position.

01:01:38.108 --> 01:01:40.489
I don't think weapons
are allowed on board, sir.

01:01:40.593 --> 01:01:41.939
During the Civil War,

01:01:42.043 --> 01:01:43.492
enlisted men
were given rifles,

01:01:43.596 --> 01:01:45.909
while officers
were given pistols.

01:01:46.012 --> 01:01:47.255
It wasn't for combat.

01:01:47.358 --> 01:01:49.326
It was to put down
insurrectionists.

01:01:50.085 --> 01:01:51.224
Cap...

01:01:51.984 --> 01:01:53.433
I'm disappointed.

01:01:53.779 --> 01:01:55.332
But I'm not surprised.

01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:58.507
What are you gonna do to me?

01:01:58.611 --> 01:02:00.164
To be decided.

01:02:00.268 --> 01:02:02.580
Right now,
I'm ordering the both of you

01:02:02.684 --> 01:02:04.859
into hibernation
while I weigh my options.

01:02:04.962 --> 01:02:07.654
I'd rather be shot
than go into hibernation!

01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:08.863
That can be arranged.

01:02:08.966 --> 01:02:11.072
I'm kidding. That's a joke.

01:02:31.092 --> 01:02:32.990
<i>Hello, John.</i>

01:02:33.094 --> 01:02:37.857
<i>In a few seconds you will
be entering deep hibernation.</i>

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:45.589
<i>Relax your body and begin
to focus on your breathing.</i>

01:02:45.692 --> 01:02:47.833
<i>You will be asleep in five...</i>

01:02:49.248 --> 01:02:50.214
<i>Four...</i>

01:02:51.457 --> 01:02:52.872
<i>Three...</i>

01:02:54.149 --> 01:02:55.219
<i>Two...</i>

01:02:56.876 --> 01:02:57.981
<i>One.</i>

01:03:25.663 --> 01:03:27.182
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:03:27.942 --> 01:03:29.081
How are you?

01:03:30.703 --> 01:03:32.394
I'm okay. How are you?

01:03:33.119 --> 01:03:34.327
Um...

01:03:34.431 --> 01:03:37.503
So, I don't know if you heard,
but I'll be leaving town soon.

01:03:37.606 --> 01:03:38.538
Yeah.

01:03:39.470 --> 01:03:42.680
Heard about that.
Was it "Titan"...?

01:03:42.784 --> 01:03:45.442
Titan. Yeah.
A billion and a half miles.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:47.927
No big deal.

01:03:52.138 --> 01:03:54.485
-How are you feeling?
- Excited.

01:03:56.108 --> 01:03:57.281
A little impatient.

01:03:59.594 --> 01:04:01.044
I'm ready to go.

01:04:01.147 --> 01:04:03.598
I'm really glad
that you came by.

01:04:04.702 --> 01:04:07.257
'Cause I wanted
to say goodbye.

01:04:09.397 --> 01:04:13.090
And I'm really sorry about
the way things ended before.

01:04:13.677 --> 01:04:15.023
I, um...

01:04:15.127 --> 01:04:18.440
I said a lot of things
that I regret.

01:04:19.717 --> 01:04:20.891
It's all right.

01:04:20.995 --> 01:04:23.652
There are also things
that I regret not saying.

01:04:24.032 --> 01:04:24.964
- Um...
- Listen...

01:04:25.068 --> 01:04:27.035
I'm really proud of you.

01:04:27.139 --> 01:04:30.107
And I'm happy that
you came into my life.

01:04:30.590 --> 01:04:31.591
So am I.

01:04:33.386 --> 01:04:36.562
You were always very clear
with me from the beginning

01:04:36.665 --> 01:04:39.013
that this is who you are.

01:04:39.116 --> 01:04:43.327
And nothing or nobody was
gonna get in the way of that.

01:04:44.501 --> 01:04:47.504
It's that steadfastness
and that...

01:04:48.401 --> 01:04:50.541
determination that
attracted me

01:04:50.645 --> 01:04:51.404
to you in the first place.

01:04:51.508 --> 01:04:53.579
Oh, I was wondering
what it was.

01:04:55.270 --> 01:04:56.340
Yeah.

01:04:56.582 --> 01:04:57.583
Hmm.

01:05:00.793 --> 01:05:01.967
Having said all that though,

01:05:02.070 --> 01:05:04.383
there is something that
I kinda want to know.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:08.697
Did you love me?

01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:12.667
I felt a lot of things.

01:05:13.633 --> 01:05:15.014
Like what?

01:05:15.532 --> 01:05:16.567
You know...

01:05:18.742 --> 01:05:20.364
- No.
- Zoe.

01:05:20.468 --> 01:05:22.504
No, I don't know.

01:05:22.608 --> 01:05:25.300
- I don't know what that means.
- I'm leaving.

01:05:28.786 --> 01:05:30.374
You know, it's okay.

01:05:36.346 --> 01:05:37.347
John.

01:05:37.968 --> 01:05:39.211
I have to go.

01:06:22.047 --> 01:06:23.531
<i>Hello, John.</i>

01:06:23.634 --> 01:06:26.983
<i>You are emerging
from deep hibernation.</i>

01:06:27.086 --> 01:06:31.884
<i>You are aboard the spacecraft
Odyssey-1, bound for Titan.</i>

01:06:32.264 --> 01:06:34.128
<i>Please be careful.</i>

01:06:34.231 --> 01:06:36.854
<i>The drugs used
to induce hibernation</i>

01:06:36.958 --> 01:06:39.512
<i>can produce mild side-effects,</i>

01:06:39.616 --> 01:06:41.756
<i>including confusion,</i>

01:06:42.446 --> 01:06:43.413
<i>nausea,</i>

01:06:43.516 --> 01:06:46.623
<i>dizziness and disorientation.</i>

01:06:50.006 --> 01:06:52.629
<i>You're sending us all to die!</i>

01:06:54.355 --> 01:06:56.529
<i>You're sending us all to die!</i>

01:06:57.289 --> 01:06:58.462
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

01:06:58.566 --> 01:07:01.638
<i>You don't have to do this.
I'm begging you, John.</i>

01:07:04.572 --> 01:07:06.988
<i>You're sending us all
to our deaths!</i>

01:07:07.092 --> 01:07:09.473
<i>I'm begging you. It's suicide.</i>

01:07:12.821 --> 01:07:14.271
<i>You're sending us all to die!</i>

01:07:14.375 --> 01:07:17.378
I wanna go home!

01:07:27.284 --> 01:07:29.148
<i>Let me
ask you something, John.</i>

01:07:31.633 --> 01:07:33.221
<i>Are we friends?</i>

01:07:34.533 --> 01:07:36.466
<i>I'd like to think
we're friends.</i>

01:08:54.716 --> 01:08:55.752
Hello, John.

01:08:57.581 --> 01:08:58.582
Captain.

01:09:01.378 --> 01:09:02.862
Where's Nash?

01:09:02.966 --> 01:09:04.761
Why do you ask that?

01:09:07.626 --> 01:09:09.317
I... I saw you.

01:09:09.421 --> 01:09:11.664
When I was going under,
I saw you attack him.

01:09:11.768 --> 01:09:12.838
We struggled.

01:09:12.941 --> 01:09:13.873
You attacked him.

01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:18.947
He was becoming
more and more, uh...

01:09:19.500 --> 01:09:20.811
Unstable.

01:09:20.915 --> 01:09:23.676
I saw an opportunity
to subdue him. I took it.

01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:25.057
That's not what I saw.

01:09:25.161 --> 01:09:26.196
Where's Nash?

01:09:27.508 --> 01:09:29.441
I put him under
until we reach Titan orbit.

01:09:29.544 --> 01:09:31.408
Oh, you think
we're gonna make it still?

01:09:31.512 --> 01:09:33.617
To Titan? Absolutely.

01:09:34.342 --> 01:09:36.344
I have no doubt.

01:09:36.448 --> 01:09:39.796
John, we've just had
a few setbacks, that's all.

01:09:39.899 --> 01:09:43.248
You, like Nash,
are having adverse reactions

01:09:43.351 --> 01:09:45.215
to the hibernation drugs.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:46.596
Just so long as you remain

01:09:46.699 --> 01:09:49.219
more of an asset
than a liability,

01:09:50.565 --> 01:09:53.050
I see no reason
for tension between us.

01:09:53.154 --> 01:09:55.398
Okay, I want you
to put your gun away.

01:09:57.123 --> 01:09:58.849
I would do that. I would.

01:09:58.953 --> 01:10:01.887
If I were certain that your
condition wouldn't degrade.

01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:03.060
I'm fine.

01:10:03.164 --> 01:10:04.200
You are?

01:10:04.303 --> 01:10:07.686
Maybe I've had
one hallucination or two.

01:10:07.789 --> 01:10:08.859
One or two.

01:10:08.963 --> 01:10:10.723
You know, an unstable mind

01:10:10.827 --> 01:10:13.381
doesn't always know
it's unstable, John.

01:10:14.762 --> 01:10:16.419
Should we talk about
something else?

01:10:16.522 --> 01:10:19.353
Like Tor Ice Station,
for example?

01:10:19.456 --> 01:10:21.355
You know,
that story that Nash told you.

01:10:22.252 --> 01:10:23.219
What about it?

01:10:23.322 --> 01:10:25.013
He needs to get
his facts right.

01:10:26.567 --> 01:10:28.327
That final year at Tor...

01:10:29.017 --> 01:10:30.226
it was a brutal winter.

01:10:30.329 --> 01:10:32.642
One of the coldest on record.

01:10:32.745 --> 01:10:34.816
And when the crack
was discovered,

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:37.267
only the commander
was thinking clearly.

01:10:37.371 --> 01:10:40.166
He told his team
they should make the trek

01:10:40.270 --> 01:10:41.789
to the nearest base,

01:10:41.892 --> 01:10:43.963
even though
the subzero temperatures

01:10:44.067 --> 01:10:46.483
meant that
survival was unlikely.

01:10:46.587 --> 01:10:49.210
Problem was, the scientists
were too afraid to leave.

01:10:49.314 --> 01:10:50.625
They were weak, John.

01:10:50.729 --> 01:10:53.904
If they had gone together,
they might have had a chance.

01:10:54.008 --> 01:10:55.561
Strength in numbers.

01:10:55.665 --> 01:10:59.531
Instead, the commander
went alone. Froze to death.

01:10:59.634 --> 01:11:02.499
His body was found
50 miles from the base.

01:11:04.018 --> 01:11:06.262
But the fact remains,

01:11:06.365 --> 01:11:09.195
the commander
acted courageously.

01:11:09.299 --> 01:11:10.266
What about the scientists?

01:11:10.369 --> 01:11:11.543
- What about all the autopsies?
- Hmm.

01:11:11.646 --> 01:11:14.028
Revealed gunshot wounds
to the head, I know.

01:11:14.131 --> 01:11:15.098
Self-inflicted.

01:11:15.201 --> 01:11:17.859
- Self-inflicted.
- Self-inflicted.

01:11:17.963 --> 01:11:20.690
Sometimes,
it's not about the results.

01:11:22.485 --> 01:11:26.074
A man is judged
by his actions.

01:11:27.731 --> 01:11:29.906
Okay,
here's the situation, John.

01:11:30.009 --> 01:11:32.080
The mission does not change.

01:11:32.184 --> 01:11:33.668
Has not changed.

01:11:33.772 --> 01:11:35.291
Will not change.

01:11:35.394 --> 01:11:36.533
I need to know.

01:11:38.501 --> 01:11:39.571
Can you work with me,

01:11:39.674 --> 01:11:41.676
or would you prefer
to hibernate, too?

01:11:42.505 --> 01:11:44.714
- I can work with you.
- Good.

01:11:44.817 --> 01:11:47.544
The X-band communications.
They're down again.

01:11:47.648 --> 01:11:49.891
So I'd like you to rerun
the diagnostics on that.

01:11:49.995 --> 01:11:51.030
Sure.

01:11:51.134 --> 01:11:53.239
Getting back in communication
with Houston should be

01:11:53.343 --> 01:11:54.965
our major priority right now.

01:11:55.069 --> 01:11:56.898
- Absolutely.
- Good.

01:11:58.279 --> 01:11:59.349
I'm gonna get
something to eat.

01:11:59.453 --> 01:12:01.972
Uh, alert me
to any developments, please.

01:12:02.801 --> 01:12:04.527
Oh, and John...

01:12:06.563 --> 01:12:08.910
I'm really glad that
we can trust each other again.

01:12:11.568 --> 01:12:17.263
<i>I'm just a soul
whose intentions are good</i>

01:12:17.367 --> 01:12:18.541
<i>Oh, Lord...</i>

01:13:13.837 --> 01:13:14.804
<i>John?</i>

01:13:23.537 --> 01:13:24.745
John?

01:13:29.681 --> 01:13:31.303
Anything on X-band?

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:32.546
No. Nothing.

01:13:32.649 --> 01:13:34.996
Not the answer
I wanted to hear.

01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:37.447
Guess we'll just have
to keep trying.

01:13:39.138 --> 01:13:41.451
You should eat something.
You look a little pale.

01:13:41.555 --> 01:13:42.763
I'm not hungry.

01:13:46.594 --> 01:13:48.458
You heard something,
didn't you?

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:51.565
No.

01:13:51.668 --> 01:13:53.670
Then why is your hand shaking?

01:13:54.257 --> 01:13:55.776
It's not shaking.

01:13:58.468 --> 01:14:01.126
She really did
a number on you, didn't she?

01:14:01.229 --> 01:14:02.196
What?

01:14:02.714 --> 01:14:04.094
Zoe.

01:14:04.198 --> 01:14:06.649
I don't want to talk about Zoe
with you, Cap, thanks.

01:14:06.752 --> 01:14:07.650
Why not?

01:14:07.753 --> 01:14:09.859
Because it's none of
your fucking business.

01:14:12.724 --> 01:14:14.139
There's something
you need to know.

01:14:14.242 --> 01:14:17.004
I hate to be the one
to break it to you, but...

01:14:17.107 --> 01:14:19.731
I think it's best
you know the truth.

01:14:19.834 --> 01:14:22.561
Your relationship with Zoe
wasn't real.

01:14:26.358 --> 01:14:27.704
Zoe was a plant.

01:14:28.084 --> 01:14:28.878
What?

01:14:28.981 --> 01:14:30.604
The selection committee
had concerns

01:14:30.707 --> 01:14:32.709
- about your emotional mettle.
- No.

01:14:32.813 --> 01:14:34.608
They wanted to make sure
you had what it takes.

01:14:34.711 --> 01:14:37.542
That's why they used Zoe.

01:14:40.683 --> 01:14:42.270
You know what, Captain?

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:46.620
The drugs are starting
to affect you.

01:14:47.379 --> 01:14:48.794
Let's talk about that.

01:14:48.898 --> 01:14:51.003
'Cause I don't think
you're fit to be in charge.

01:14:51.107 --> 01:14:53.212
Think about it. Just...

01:14:54.317 --> 01:14:55.974
You're deluded!

01:14:56.077 --> 01:14:58.770
Okay, that time you ran
into Zoe at the coffee bar.

01:14:58.873 --> 01:15:00.979
Do you think
she was there by accident?

01:15:06.847 --> 01:15:09.194
- You're lost!
- Is that what you think?

01:15:10.367 --> 01:15:11.576
Hi.

01:15:11.679 --> 01:15:14.544
And when she sat next to you
at the Titan lecture.

01:15:14.648 --> 01:15:18.065
She just happened
to be looking for a seat

01:15:18.168 --> 01:15:19.722
the moment Gordon got up!

01:15:21.758 --> 01:15:23.967
- What about that?
- How do you know all this?

01:15:24.071 --> 01:15:26.729
When you ran into her
outside your apartment.

01:15:27.799 --> 01:15:30.836
Why was she jogging
in your neighborhood?

01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:32.942
You guys live
on opposite sides of town.

01:15:34.771 --> 01:15:36.739
Don't you think
that's suspicious, John?

01:15:36.842 --> 01:15:38.188
How do you know this?

01:15:40.190 --> 01:15:42.089
How do you know all this?

01:15:42.192 --> 01:15:43.884
How do you think I know?

01:15:45.023 --> 01:15:47.059
I was on
the selection committee, John.

01:15:47.163 --> 01:15:48.544
John!

01:15:50.028 --> 01:15:50.856
Oh, yeah?

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.341
Let me introduce you
to Zoe Morgan.

01:15:53.445 --> 01:15:55.205
<i>Zoe told us everything.</i>

01:15:55.309 --> 01:15:57.760
She was just doing her job.

01:15:57.863 --> 01:15:59.278
She did it admirably.

01:16:00.763 --> 01:16:02.903
You're so full of shit.

01:16:03.869 --> 01:16:05.319
<i>You're full of shit.</i>

01:16:07.321 --> 01:16:09.185
You and Nash are full of shit.

01:16:09.288 --> 01:16:11.877
Because you're both jealous
of what I have.

01:16:14.190 --> 01:16:14.984
Where you going?

01:16:15.087 --> 01:16:17.193
- Fix the radios!
- That's the head.

01:16:17.296 --> 01:16:18.228
Yeah...

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:22.336
That's the galley.

01:16:25.891 --> 01:16:27.583
Storage is that way.

01:16:28.342 --> 01:16:29.343
I know that.

01:16:53.401 --> 01:16:55.680
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

01:16:55.783 --> 01:16:58.337
- It's John, right?
- Yes.

01:16:58.441 --> 01:17:00.201
- Zoe.
- Morgan.

01:17:02.894 --> 01:17:03.929
No.

01:17:05.344 --> 01:17:06.760
<i>May I?</i>

01:17:06.863 --> 01:17:09.003
I wouldn't trade this time
for the world.

01:17:09.107 --> 01:17:13.076
<i>And everyday I wake up and
I'm excited and I'm inspired.</i>

01:17:13.421 --> 01:17:14.802
No.

01:17:14.906 --> 01:17:16.632
<i>It's the most important
job you'll ever have.</i>

01:17:16.735 --> 01:17:20.290
<i>And my sister jokes that
it's my longest relationship.</i>

01:17:22.327 --> 01:17:23.293
Okay.

01:17:24.812 --> 01:17:26.124
<i>Anyway, what about you?</i>

01:17:26.227 --> 01:17:29.437
<i>If you get chosen,
won't you miss your life here?</i>

01:17:29.541 --> 01:17:30.715
<i>No.</i>

01:17:30.818 --> 01:17:32.889
<i>I've always been a loner.</i>

01:17:32.993 --> 01:17:34.960
<i>Only child syndrome.</i>

01:17:35.064 --> 01:17:38.170
<i>It's such a coincidence
we ran into each other.</i>

01:17:38.274 --> 01:17:41.553
You're not a big fan
of furniture, I take it?

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:44.556
Um, no, I'm preparing
for life in space.

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.178
Oh.

01:17:46.282 --> 01:17:47.317
That was a joke.

01:17:47.421 --> 01:17:49.734
Mmm-hmm. I couldn't tell.

01:17:49.837 --> 01:17:51.356
Yeah, I could tell that.

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:53.738
Who is this man in the photo?

01:17:57.603 --> 01:17:59.053
He's my father.

01:17:59.157 --> 01:18:02.022
He spent the last three years
of his life in Antarctica.

01:18:02.125 --> 01:18:05.370
That picture was taken
just before he died.

01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:07.372
<i>John.</i>

01:18:07.475 --> 01:18:08.476
<i>John.</i>

01:18:09.512 --> 01:18:10.478
Hello?

01:18:10.996 --> 01:18:11.963
Hello?

01:18:15.276 --> 01:18:16.415
<i>Are you there?</i>

01:18:17.623 --> 01:18:18.624
Hello?

01:18:18.728 --> 01:18:19.936
- Hello?
<i>- John.</i>

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:21.041
- Yes?
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>

01:18:21.144 --> 01:18:23.112
Yes! This is John
aboard Odyssey-1.

01:18:23.215 --> 01:18:25.493
- Who's this?
<i>- What is your status?</i>

01:18:25.597 --> 01:18:26.563
Hello?

01:18:26.667 --> 01:18:28.980
<i>Repeat.
What is your status? Over.</i>

01:18:29.083 --> 01:18:30.913
We're okay, Houston! Uh...

01:18:31.016 --> 01:18:32.742
We're okay. We've lost comms.

01:18:32.846 --> 01:18:34.571
We've had some
structural damage.

01:18:34.675 --> 01:18:36.194
Nash...

01:18:36.297 --> 01:18:38.334
is in hibernation.
Because, uh...

01:18:38.852 --> 01:18:40.370
He had, uh...

01:18:41.509 --> 01:18:42.510
Problems.

01:18:42.614 --> 01:18:44.616
<i>John? Please repeat!</i>

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:45.686
We are not okay.

01:18:45.790 --> 01:18:47.515
<i>Who is in hibernation?</i>

01:18:49.759 --> 01:18:50.864
<i>John.</i>

01:18:52.486 --> 01:18:53.487
Hello?

01:18:56.455 --> 01:18:57.456
Hello?

01:19:00.425 --> 01:19:01.357
Hello?

01:19:03.152 --> 01:19:05.016
<i>John,
report to the bridge.</i>

01:19:05.119 --> 01:19:07.018
<i>Report to the bridge now.</i>

01:19:14.059 --> 01:19:15.681
I'm going to
ask you a question,

01:19:15.785 --> 01:19:18.305
and I want you
to answer me very carefully.

01:19:18.408 --> 01:19:19.375
Yes, sir.

01:19:19.478 --> 01:19:21.411
What were you just doing?

01:19:22.378 --> 01:19:24.932
- Checking the equipment.
- Specifically.

01:19:25.968 --> 01:19:27.452
Checking
the terrestrial radios.

01:19:27.555 --> 01:19:29.281
And what were the results?

01:19:31.663 --> 01:19:32.733
I know this sounds crazy,

01:19:32.837 --> 01:19:34.528
but I think that
I made contact.

01:19:34.631 --> 01:19:36.081
Contact with whom?

01:19:38.635 --> 01:19:40.223
- Houston.
- Houston!

01:19:41.846 --> 01:19:43.364
Houston.

01:19:43.468 --> 01:19:46.989
Even though they are six
hundred million miles away?

01:19:49.785 --> 01:19:51.890
Six hundred million miles!

01:19:53.271 --> 01:19:55.135
You want someone
to be there that bad?

01:19:55.238 --> 01:19:57.137
Sir, I'm not crazy.
I heard it.

01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:00.623
The same way you heard Zoe's
voice in here a while ago?

01:20:00.726 --> 01:20:03.419
And saw her in your quarters?

01:20:03.522 --> 01:20:07.319
You only hear these signals
on the handheld radios.

01:20:07.423 --> 01:20:08.804
It's never on X-band,

01:20:08.907 --> 01:20:10.598
which gets recorded
by the computer,

01:20:10.702 --> 01:20:11.841
which we could
play back to verify.

01:20:11.945 --> 01:20:13.429
Yeah, I agree
that's improbable, sir,

01:20:13.532 --> 01:20:15.293
but if you were there,
you would've heard it too.

01:20:15.396 --> 01:20:16.466
I was there.

01:20:16.570 --> 01:20:17.709
I kept the intercom open

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:19.469
while you were
in equipment storage.

01:20:19.573 --> 01:20:20.850
So you heard it?

01:20:21.402 --> 01:20:22.403
No.

01:20:23.404 --> 01:20:25.337
I heard you.

01:20:25.441 --> 01:20:28.030
Having a conversation with
empty static. Take a look.

01:20:36.762 --> 01:20:38.212
Go and have a seat, John.

01:20:41.457 --> 01:20:42.596
Take a seat, John.

01:20:46.842 --> 01:20:48.015
I'm sorry.

01:20:50.121 --> 01:20:51.260
I'm sorry, but look,

01:20:51.363 --> 01:20:55.022
we have been in space
for nearly two years.

01:20:55.126 --> 01:20:59.578
We've been subjected to very
powerful drugs to sedate us.

01:20:59.682 --> 01:21:01.132
The situation's
been exacerbated

01:21:01.235 --> 01:21:02.719
by damage incurred
to the hull,

01:21:02.823 --> 01:21:04.514
the source of which
we still don't know,

01:21:04.618 --> 01:21:06.827
as well as communication
issues with Ground.

01:21:06.931 --> 01:21:09.105
Now I ask you,
which is more likely,

01:21:10.210 --> 01:21:11.487
that you picked up
a walkie-talkie

01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:14.179
and had a live conversation
with someone back on Earth,

01:21:14.283 --> 01:21:17.527
or your imagination is playing
a cruel trick on you?

01:21:21.152 --> 01:21:23.188
You wanna hear it?
I can play it back for you.

01:21:23.292 --> 01:21:24.949
I recorded the conversation.

01:21:25.984 --> 01:21:27.848
<i>Yes! This is John
aboard Odyssey-1.</i>

01:21:27.952 --> 01:21:29.401
No, please don't.
Please don't.

01:21:29.505 --> 01:21:31.093
- Okay.
- Please don't.

01:21:32.094 --> 01:21:33.612
I don't wanna see that.

01:21:39.239 --> 01:21:41.068
I'll get you through this.

01:21:41.966 --> 01:21:43.588
But you gotta trust me.

01:21:45.072 --> 01:21:46.971
We're still friends,
aren't we?

01:21:48.731 --> 01:21:49.697
Absolutely.

01:21:50.595 --> 01:21:51.389
Attaboy.

01:21:51.492 --> 01:21:53.494
It just so happens
that we have a...

01:21:54.219 --> 01:21:55.220
sleep cycle scheduled...

01:21:55.324 --> 01:21:57.636
No, I don't wanna
hibernate like Nash.

01:21:58.016 --> 01:21:59.224
Relax.

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:02.055
Just relax. There you go.

01:22:03.056 --> 01:22:04.367
It'll be all right.

01:22:05.782 --> 01:22:07.543
It'll be all right.

01:22:09.234 --> 01:22:12.651
Besides,
look how far you've come.

01:22:23.904 --> 01:22:24.974
This is the most
important thing

01:22:25.078 --> 01:22:27.045
we'll ever do
in our entire lives.

01:22:27.149 --> 01:22:29.047
Failure is not an option.

01:22:29.151 --> 01:22:30.946
The mission comes first.

01:22:31.049 --> 01:22:32.292
Always.

01:22:34.225 --> 01:22:36.468
You do understand that,
don't you, John?

01:22:38.401 --> 01:22:39.368
John?

01:22:46.133 --> 01:22:47.583
John, what are you doing?

01:22:48.998 --> 01:22:50.413
You have to go under first.

01:22:50.517 --> 01:22:52.139
You can't be awake
while I'm in stasis,

01:22:52.243 --> 01:22:54.590
not in your current condition.
I will not allow it.

01:22:54.693 --> 01:22:56.454
I want to see Nash.

01:22:56.868 --> 01:22:59.008
I told you. He's asleep.

01:22:59.112 --> 01:23:00.285
Wake him up.

01:23:00.389 --> 01:23:03.668
- I want to know he's okay.
- I can't do that.

01:23:03.771 --> 01:23:06.050
His sleep cycle just started.

01:23:06.153 --> 01:23:07.637
I just reset it.

01:23:07.741 --> 01:23:10.054
I will bring you to him.

01:23:10.157 --> 01:23:11.641
I wanna see him here.

01:23:11.745 --> 01:23:12.677
Not gonna happen.

01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.265
Captain, I want to see Nash!

01:23:14.368 --> 01:23:15.887
John, you know
I could order the computer

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:17.406
to open the door
any time I want to.

01:23:17.509 --> 01:23:19.546
I'm asking you to do it
of your own free will.

01:23:19.649 --> 01:23:21.927
Just wanna see that he's okay,
bring him here.

01:23:22.031 --> 01:23:23.170
John...

01:23:24.137 --> 01:23:25.690
Do it! Now!

01:23:42.293 --> 01:23:43.639
Okay, take me to Nash.

01:23:44.157 --> 01:23:45.296
Yes, sir.

01:23:51.923 --> 01:23:53.614
I ought to shoot you
right now.

01:23:59.862 --> 01:24:01.243
On your feet.

01:24:05.281 --> 01:24:06.489
Time for bed.

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:17.397
- Captain...
- Come on, open it up.

01:25:04.133 --> 01:25:05.514
Where is Nash?

01:25:10.795 --> 01:25:12.210
Where is Nash?

01:25:27.639 --> 01:25:30.021
You still don't get it, John?

01:25:30.435 --> 01:25:32.437
You'll never find him!

01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:39.824
Not like this.
Not in your current condition!

01:25:39.927 --> 01:25:40.894
<i>John!</i>

01:25:42.516 --> 01:25:44.346
Dreaming about space, John?

01:25:44.449 --> 01:25:45.968
<i>I am just a soul</i>

01:25:46.071 --> 01:25:48.073
<i>whose intentions are good.</i>

01:25:48.177 --> 01:25:49.834
It's clearer than ice!

01:25:52.595 --> 01:25:54.390
<i>Are we still friends, John?</i>

01:25:54.494 --> 01:25:56.703
<i>I wanna go home.</i>

01:25:56.806 --> 01:25:59.119
<i>You need
a friend up here, you know!</i>

01:26:00.569 --> 01:26:02.674
It's just in your head.
It's just in your head.

01:26:02.778 --> 01:26:03.848
Johnny Boy!

01:26:49.514 --> 01:26:50.446
Nash?

01:27:01.181 --> 01:27:03.356
You're endangering
the mission.

01:27:08.326 --> 01:27:10.432
- You're endangering...
- Why are you doing this...

01:27:10.535 --> 01:27:12.261
You're endangering the...

01:27:12.365 --> 01:27:13.642
...to me?

01:27:14.746 --> 01:27:15.747
You're endanger...

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:17.818
You!

01:27:17.922 --> 01:27:21.719
It's... it's you
who endangered the mission.

01:27:22.513 --> 01:27:23.859
Tried to kill us!

01:27:27.483 --> 01:27:29.071
The mission...

01:27:29.174 --> 01:27:30.348
You're endangering...

01:27:38.632 --> 01:27:40.151
Computer,
enable voice command.

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:42.429
<i>Voice command enabled.</i>

01:27:43.741 --> 01:27:44.811
Where is Nash?

01:27:44.914 --> 01:27:46.640
Nash is on the bridge.

01:27:46.744 --> 01:27:47.710
No...

01:27:48.297 --> 01:27:49.436
What?

01:27:56.236 --> 01:27:58.652
Computer,
where is Captain Franks?

01:27:59.377 --> 01:28:01.828
<i>Captain Franks
is on the bridge.</i>

01:28:04.037 --> 01:28:05.625
Computer, where is Nash?

01:28:06.626 --> 01:28:08.352
<i>Nash is on the bridge.</i>

01:28:15.151 --> 01:28:17.499
- Is Nash alive?
<i>- Yes.</i>

01:28:17.809 --> 01:28:19.397
<i>Nash is alive.</i>

01:28:24.299 --> 01:28:25.817
Is the whole crew alive?

01:28:27.509 --> 01:28:29.994
<i>Yes, the crew is alive.</i>

01:28:31.375 --> 01:28:32.548
What...

01:28:41.281 --> 01:28:42.938
What is the crew manifest?

01:28:43.041 --> 01:28:45.389
<i>Crew Manifest, Odyssey-1.</i>

01:28:45.492 --> 01:28:48.392
<i>Crew one, name...</i>

01:28:48.495 --> 01:28:51.567
<i>Captain John Franks Nash.</i>

01:28:51.671 --> 01:28:53.845
<i>Houston,
this is Odyssey-1.</i>

01:28:53.949 --> 01:28:57.193
<i>John speaking. Happy holidays
to everyone down there.</i>

01:28:57.297 --> 01:29:00.265
I'm only talking
about 12 hours.

01:29:00.369 --> 01:29:03.338
No you're not.
You're talking about a mutiny.

01:29:04.787 --> 01:29:06.858
I'm not here either, you know.

01:29:07.480 --> 01:29:08.791
I know that.

01:29:28.535 --> 01:29:29.985
Am I alone?

01:29:32.436 --> 01:29:33.575
<i>Yes.</i>

01:29:39.822 --> 01:29:41.030
<i>Anyway, what about you?</i>

01:29:41.134 --> 01:29:44.724
<i>If you are chosen,
won't you miss your life here?</i>

01:29:45.414 --> 01:29:47.416
<i>Friends and family?</i>

01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:48.762
<i>No.</i>

01:29:48.866 --> 01:29:50.005
<i>I've always been a loner.</i>

01:29:50.108 --> 01:29:51.972
<i>I really didn't
want it to be you.</i>

01:29:54.319 --> 01:29:56.321
<i>This is bigger than us.</i>

01:29:56.425 --> 01:29:57.771
<i>Don't you feel anything?</i>

01:29:57.875 --> 01:30:00.222
<i>The drugs
used to induce hibernation</i>

01:30:00.325 --> 01:30:01.741
<i>can produce
mild side-effects...</i>

01:30:01.844 --> 01:30:04.813
<i>Captain John Franks Nash.</i>

01:30:04.916 --> 01:30:06.021
<i>...including...</i>

01:30:06.124 --> 01:30:07.229
<i>Houston! We're okay.</i>

01:30:07.332 --> 01:30:09.024
<i>...confusion,</i>

01:30:09.127 --> 01:30:10.474
<i>nausea, dizziness</i>

01:30:10.577 --> 01:30:12.476

-<i>Be quiet! Stop it!</i>

01:30:12.579 --> 01:30:14.063
<i>Stop it! Stop!</i>

01:30:15.755 --> 01:30:18.205
<i>I'm gonna turn in.
Over and out, Houston.</i>

01:30:18.309 --> 01:30:21.070
<i>You have
been gone a long time, John.</i>

01:30:21.174 --> 01:30:23.935
<i>What is the thing you miss
most about home?</i>

01:31:14.917 --> 01:31:18.300
Hello? Hello? This is John,
aboard Odyssey-1. I need help.

01:31:23.408 --> 01:31:24.720
Houston!

01:31:24.824 --> 01:31:25.756
Or whoever's out there,

01:31:25.859 --> 01:31:27.999
I don't know
if you can hear this.

01:31:31.175 --> 01:31:32.279
Please send help!

01:31:36.421 --> 01:31:37.871
[ON RADIO] <i>John?</i>

01:31:44.913 --> 01:31:46.915
- Zoe?
<i>- John, it's me.</i>

01:31:47.916 --> 01:31:48.882
Hi!

01:31:49.365 --> 01:31:50.539
<i>John!</i>

01:31:56.200 --> 01:31:57.581
It can't be you.

01:31:58.547 --> 01:31:59.997
This is not you.

01:32:01.999 --> 01:32:04.622
<i>It is me!
Listen, are you okay?</i>

01:32:05.347 --> 01:32:06.521
No!

01:32:07.418 --> 01:32:09.282
I think I'm going crazy.

01:32:10.663 --> 01:32:11.974
I need help.

01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:16.116
<i>- John!</i>
- Um...

01:32:19.637 --> 01:32:21.984
I think that
I killed Captain Franks.

01:32:25.194 --> 01:32:26.886
But I don't know.

01:32:26.989 --> 01:32:29.233
I'm feeling
a little bit confused.

01:32:30.924 --> 01:32:33.651
<i>And I think that
Captain Franks killed Nash.</i>

01:32:33.755 --> 01:32:36.067
But I don't know
if that's true either.

01:32:37.137 --> 01:32:37.931
<i>John, listen.</i>

01:32:38.035 --> 01:32:39.623
<i>I'm here with Sam Napier,</i>

01:32:39.726 --> 01:32:41.417
<i>and he asked me
to talk to you.</i>

01:32:41.521 --> 01:32:44.351
<i>The hibernation drugs,
the dosage was too strong.</i>

01:32:44.455 --> 01:32:45.905
<i>That's why you're confused.</i>

01:32:46.008 --> 01:32:48.355
Okay. I thought
that might be it.

01:32:49.356 --> 01:32:50.668
Zoe.

01:32:51.186 --> 01:32:54.707
How many people
are on Odyssey-1?

01:32:56.018 --> 01:32:57.364
<i>Only you.</i>

01:32:57.468 --> 01:32:59.090
That is impossible.

01:32:59.194 --> 01:33:02.128
<i>Did you see any other crew
quarters besides your own?</i>

01:33:02.231 --> 01:33:04.889
<i>Any other
hibernation chambers?</i>

01:33:04.993 --> 01:33:07.582
<i>Odyssey can only support
a crew of one.</i>

01:33:09.687 --> 01:33:12.794
How am I talking to you
without delay?

01:33:12.897 --> 01:33:15.382
<i>- John, I'm gonna put Sam on.</i>
- No, don't!

01:33:16.176 --> 01:33:17.177
No!

01:33:18.178 --> 01:33:19.628
You tell me.

01:33:21.078 --> 01:33:22.044
<i>Okay.</i>

01:33:22.666 --> 01:33:23.908
<i>You never left.</i>

01:33:25.358 --> 01:33:26.808
<i>You never launched.</i>

01:33:28.637 --> 01:33:29.776
What?

01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:32.779
<i>You were in hibernation
before launch.</i>

01:33:32.883 --> 01:33:36.231
<i>ATS built a training facility
in New Mexico.</i>

01:33:36.334 --> 01:33:39.027
<i>A perfect replica,
reactor and everything.</i>

01:33:39.130 --> 01:33:42.271
<i>You're 1,000 feet underground.</i>

01:33:42.375 --> 01:33:45.896
<i>They needed to do a dry run
without you knowing.</i>

01:33:45.999 --> 01:33:47.587
<i>John, I didn't know
about it either.</i>

01:33:47.691 --> 01:33:50.141
<i>I would never have
let this happen.</i>

01:33:50.245 --> 01:33:51.695
<i>You have to believe me.</i>

01:33:51.798 --> 01:33:53.282
I saw Jupiter.

01:33:54.767 --> 01:33:56.700
I saw Jupiter!

01:33:57.839 --> 01:33:59.979
And there was the slingshot...

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:03.430
<i>It...</i>
<i>It was all simulated.</i>

01:34:04.121 --> 01:34:05.432
It felt real.

01:34:05.536 --> 01:34:07.193
<i>It had to feel real.</i>

01:34:07.296 --> 01:34:09.333
<i>That's the whole point.</i>

01:34:09.436 --> 01:34:12.301
<i>The communications system was
linked back to the surface.</i>

01:34:12.405 --> 01:34:13.509
<i>We're directly above you.</i>

01:34:13.613 --> 01:34:15.270
- You come and get me.
<i>- We're trying.</i>

01:34:15.373 --> 01:34:17.790
<i>As you know, there was
also an 8.4 earthquake</i>

01:34:17.893 --> 01:34:19.895
<i>in New Mexico
earlier this month...</i>

01:34:19.999 --> 01:34:21.690
<i>Part of
the access tunnel collapsed.</i>

01:34:21.794 --> 01:34:24.382
<i>It severed
the communication cables.</i>

01:34:24.486 --> 01:34:27.316
<i>We had to hope that
you would try the radios.</i>

01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:29.629
<i>For a while,
we thought you were dead.</i>

01:34:29.733 --> 01:34:30.975
<i>Because of the collapse,</i>

01:34:31.079 --> 01:34:33.357
<i>there was no way
to reduce your drug intake.</i>

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:34.669
<i>Each hibernation raised</i>

01:34:34.772 --> 01:34:37.050
<i>the toxicity levels
in your blood.</i>

01:34:37.154 --> 01:34:38.224
<i>They're drilling
a rescue hole,</i>

01:34:38.327 --> 01:34:40.951
<i>but if there's
another collapse...</i>

01:34:41.054 --> 01:34:43.367
<i>We... We need to get you
out of there.</i>

01:34:44.264 --> 01:34:45.818
<i>Where are you now?</i>

01:34:45.921 --> 01:34:49.166
In equipment, um, storage.

01:34:49.269 --> 01:34:52.134
<i>All you have to do is
open the airlock and walk out.</i>

01:34:52.238 --> 01:34:53.584
<i>Head upwards,
towards the light.</i>

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:54.792
Okay.

01:34:54.896 --> 01:34:56.863
<i>You'll hit the rescue tunnel
soon enough.</i>

01:34:58.244 --> 01:34:59.486
That's it?

01:34:59.590 --> 01:35:00.764
<i>That's it.</i>

01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:03.111
<i>I'm right here, John.</i>

01:35:04.319 --> 01:35:05.803
<i>I'll be waiting for you.</i>

01:35:07.598 --> 01:35:08.806
<i>I love you.</i>

01:35:15.848 --> 01:35:17.919
<i>John, there isn't
much time, hurry!</i>

01:35:27.204 --> 01:35:28.308
John!

01:35:29.585 --> 01:35:31.208
John, don't go out there.

01:35:32.761 --> 01:35:34.280
You're not real.

01:35:35.212 --> 01:35:36.213
"Real"?

01:35:37.939 --> 01:35:40.458
I am standing
right in front of you.

01:35:43.772 --> 01:35:45.049
You're not real.

01:35:45.153 --> 01:35:46.913
You wanna tell me that
the voices you think

01:35:47.017 --> 01:35:50.123
you're hearing on the radio
are real, and I'm not?

01:35:52.056 --> 01:35:55.819
You're presenting with
irrationality and paranoia.

01:35:55.922 --> 01:35:58.649
You are reacting to the drugs.

01:35:58.753 --> 01:36:00.271
You can't hurt me.

01:36:00.685 --> 01:36:01.756
You can't do anything.

01:36:01.859 --> 01:36:04.551
I'm not the one
you should be worried about!

01:36:04.655 --> 01:36:06.691
We are in deep space.

01:36:06.795 --> 01:36:08.003
I don't believe you.

01:36:08.107 --> 01:36:10.005
Six hundred million miles
from Earth,

01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:12.456
and you're about
to open the airlock!

01:36:12.559 --> 01:36:13.871
Zoe told me everything.

01:36:13.975 --> 01:36:16.978
No. All you've done is
fabricate a scenario

01:36:17.081 --> 01:36:19.256
where everything makes sense.

01:36:19.359 --> 01:36:21.706
Where you and Zoe ride off
into the sunset together.

01:36:21.810 --> 01:36:23.087
You can't prove it!

01:36:23.191 --> 01:36:25.055
You're having
imaginary conversations.

01:36:25.158 --> 01:36:26.297
It'd be impossible for anyone

01:36:26.401 --> 01:36:28.092
to prove anything
to you right now.

01:36:32.338 --> 01:36:33.304
John, stop.

01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:35.306
Wait!

01:36:36.652 --> 01:36:38.171
John!

01:36:38.275 --> 01:36:40.933
<i>Warning!
Spacesuit not detected.</i>

01:36:41.036 --> 01:36:42.141
The moment
you open that door,

01:36:42.244 --> 01:36:44.488
you'll be sucked out
into space!

01:36:44.591 --> 01:36:47.594
You'll lose consciousness
within 15 seconds!

01:36:47.698 --> 01:36:49.665
Last thing you'll feel

01:36:49.769 --> 01:36:51.806
will be the saliva
boiling off your tongue.

01:36:51.909 --> 01:36:53.600
Is that how you want
to be remembered?

01:36:53.704 --> 01:36:54.878
Failing your country?

01:36:54.981 --> 01:36:56.811
Dying in infamy
like your father?

01:36:56.914 --> 01:37:00.849
- Who is this man in the photo?
- He is my father.

01:37:00.953 --> 01:37:02.747
<i>He was a commander
in the Navy.</i>

01:37:02.851 --> 01:37:03.956
He died when I was 11.

01:37:04.853 --> 01:37:06.406
It's not too late.

01:37:08.477 --> 01:37:11.377
<i>My whole life,
I thought I was a loner.</i>

01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:14.449
<i>But I was just alone.</i>

01:37:14.552 --> 01:37:16.451
John, you can still
complete the mission.

01:37:16.554 --> 01:37:19.419
- I trust Zoe.
-Trust yourself, John.

01:37:19.523 --> 01:37:21.076
I'll stay with you forever.

01:37:21.180 --> 01:37:22.664
<i>And I'll never leave.</i>

01:37:22.767 --> 01:37:24.045
I know that
she's waiting for me.

01:37:24.148 --> 01:37:25.494
Trust yourself, John.

01:37:28.946 --> 01:37:30.223
I'm gonna go home.

01:37:32.398 --> 01:37:33.157
John.

01:37:33.261 --> 01:37:34.469
<i>Warning! Override.</i>

01:37:34.572 --> 01:37:36.298
John? Don't do this!

01:37:38.714 --> 01:37:39.888
John!

01:37:39.992 --> 01:37:41.959
<i>Outer door will open in 15...</i>

01:37:42.063 --> 01:37:43.823
Don't do this!

01:37:43.927 --> 01:37:45.342
<i>Fourteen...</i>

01:37:46.481 --> 01:37:47.516
<i>Thirteen...</i>

01:37:49.311 --> 01:37:50.347
<i>Twelve...</i>

01:37:52.004 --> 01:37:53.177
<i>Eleven...</i>

01:37:54.627 --> 01:37:55.939
<i>Ten...</i>

01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:57.733
- Zoe!
<i>- Nine...</i>

01:37:57.837 --> 01:37:59.114
Can you hear me?

01:37:59.528 --> 01:38:00.529
<i>Eight...</i>

01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:03.429
<i>Seven...</i>

01:38:03.532 --> 01:38:05.396
- Zoe!
<i>- Six...</i>

01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:07.019
<i>Yes, John, I'm here!</i>

01:38:07.122 --> 01:38:08.641
<i>- Five...</i>
-<i>John?</i>

01:38:09.918 --> 01:38:11.092
<i>Four...</i>

01:38:12.334 --> 01:38:13.197
<i>Three...</i>

01:38:13.301 --> 01:38:15.337
I want you to know
that I love you.

01:38:15.441 --> 01:38:16.442
<i>Two...</i>

01:38:17.719 --> 01:38:19.652
- I love you so much...
<i>- One.</i>

01:39:21.679 --> 01:39:23.164
Can you hear us, John?

01:39:23.267 --> 01:39:24.993
I'm here, John!

01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:26.512
Go to the light!

01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:28.307
Zoe!

01:39:41.803 --> 01:39:43.184
I'm here!

01:39:44.564 --> 01:39:46.601
Hey! I'm here!

01:39:46.704 --> 01:39:48.051
We're on our way, John!

01:39:48.154 --> 01:39:50.018
Just hold out!

01:40:17.321 --> 01:40:20.255
<i>Do you know why
moths fly into the light?</i>

01:40:22.016 --> 01:40:23.603
<i>When a moth is in danger,</i>

01:40:23.707 --> 01:40:27.021
<i>the best escape-route
tends to be towards the light.</i>

01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:34.269
