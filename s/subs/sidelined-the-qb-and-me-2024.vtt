10:48.536 --> 10:51.806
I could call him up, put in a good word?

10:51.806 --> 10:55.076
Might be nice to have a backup plan.

10:55.076 --> 10:57.278
CalArts is the only plan.

10:57.278 --> 10:59.647
You sound just like your mama.

10:59.647 --> 11:01.682
I just want you to have options.

11:01.682 --> 11:04.552
CalArts is an incredible program,

11:04.552 --> 11:06.587
but it's extremely competitive.

11:06.587 --> 11:09.890
Which is why I've been training for years.

11:09.890 --> 11:13.427
I literally just danced circles around everyone else.

11:13.427 --> 11:15.363
You're an incredible dancer...

11:15.363 --> 11:18.199
but you're not ready.

11:18.199 --> 11:19.600
Not yet.

11:22.303 --> 11:25.039
The bar at CalArts is nearly impossible,

11:25.039 --> 11:26.440
especially for video auditions.

11:26.440 --> 11:28.476
But not out of the realm of possibility.

11:28.476 --> 11:30.878
Now you really sound like your mama.

11:30.878 --> 11:32.079
You really wanna do this?

11:32.079 --> 11:33.347
I do!

11:33.347 --> 11:34.849
Then you need to get out of your head.

11:34.849 --> 11:37.251
I can see you thinking about the choreo.

11:37.251 --> 11:38.552
You're too rigid.

11:38.552 --> 11:40.187
You need to be spontaneous.

11:40.187 --> 11:42.256
But it's a routine. We follow the steps.

11:42.256 --> 11:43.891
But it has to feel like

11:43.891 --> 11:47.728
it's the first and last time that you'll ever do it.

11:47.728 --> 11:50.364
You'll get there.

11:50.364 --> 11:51.932
You'll lock up?

11:53.301 --> 11:56.470
[♪♪♪]

12:00.474 --> 12:02.410
Hey! It was my turn to do the shopping.

12:02.410 --> 12:03.978
Yeah, but I was on my way back from practice,

12:03.978 --> 12:06.714
figured I'd bang it out. One less thing on your plate.

12:06.714 --> 12:08.616
Mm. What a sweet legal guardian.

12:08.616 --> 12:10.451
You can just say "brother."

12:14.221 --> 12:17.491
Okay.

12:17.491 --> 12:19.994
Ooh! Are you making fried rice this week?

12:19.994 --> 12:20.928
Of course.

12:20.928 --> 12:23.264
When are you gonna teach me how to make it?

12:23.264 --> 12:25.032
When you are ready, young Padawan.

12:25.032 --> 12:26.167
-Mm. -How was your day?

12:26.167 --> 12:27.168
Awful.

12:27.168 --> 12:28.836
Besides the car,

12:28.836 --> 12:30.638
Alicia said I'm never getting into CalArts,

12:30.638 --> 12:32.473
and I should quit while I'm ahead.

12:32.473 --> 12:34.508
What did she actually say?

12:34.508 --> 12:37.078
That I'm not ready, but I'll get there.

12:37.078 --> 12:38.612
Mm. That sounds about right.

12:38.612 --> 12:39.647
But...

12:39.647 --> 12:42.049
now I have to throw out my whole routine

12:42.049 --> 12:43.451
and start from scratch,

12:43.451 --> 12:45.820
and it'll be hours on top of school and work,

12:45.820 --> 12:48.155
and Gabby convinced me to join cheerleading.

12:48.155 --> 12:49.924
Didn't CalArts say that you need...

12:49.924 --> 12:51.492
Extracurriculars, I know.

12:51.492 --> 12:53.461
So I need to put my head down and focus.

12:53.461 --> 12:55.129
Look, I hear you,

12:55.129 --> 12:56.564
but in the meantime,

12:56.564 --> 12:59.133
you're letting your senior year pass you by

12:59.133 --> 13:01.669
before it's even started.

13:01.669 --> 13:05.139
Maybe joining cheer, or going to a party,

13:05.139 --> 13:07.074
or dare I say a date?

13:07.074 --> 13:09.677
-I don't date. -Even though you don't date.

13:09.677 --> 13:10.611
You know?

13:10.611 --> 13:14.115
Actually enjoy being 18.

13:18.252 --> 13:20.421
That doesn't sound so bad.

13:20.421 --> 13:21.822

13:21.822 --> 13:23.557
You know, you're not half bad

Hey, Cheer.

13:35.603 --> 13:37.338

13:37.338 --> 13:39.573
[chuckles] I'm sorry about earlier.

13:39.573 --> 13:42.777
This... should more than cover it.

13:51.118 --> 13:52.553
I'm not your charity case.

13:52.553 --> 13:54.054
Look, it's not like that. All right?

13:54.054 --> 13:57.625
It was my fault, and I want to make it right.

13:59.527 --> 14:02.229
Okay. Thank you.

14:02.229 --> 14:03.497
I'll get you back.

14:03.497 --> 14:06.667
No way. Consider it my idiot tax.

14:07.635 --> 14:08.936
In that case, I think you're short.

14:11.172 --> 14:12.907
Guess I'll see you at school?

14:16.744 --> 14:17.945
Mr. Douglas agreed to write

14:17.945 --> 14:20.281
my letter of recommendation for Princeton.

14:20.281 --> 14:21.816
Yes, Gabs! That's huge.

14:21.816 --> 14:23.884
Thank you. I'm so excited. I really feel...

14:23.884 --> 14:26.620
Hey, guys. Dallas, how's your car?

14:26.620 --> 14:28.589
In the ICU, having open-heart surgery,

14:28.589 --> 14:30.057
but thanks for asking.

14:30.057 --> 14:31.392
Your presentation

14:31.392 --> 14:33.060
on the radioactive nature of bananas

14:33.060 --> 14:35.029
was fascinating, but...

14:35.029 --> 14:37.131
also terrifying.

14:37.131 --> 14:38.165
[laughs] Thank you.

14:38.165 --> 14:40.034
Don't worry. You'd have to eat a million bananas

14:40.034 --> 14:41.869
to actually die of radiation poisoning.

14:41.869 --> 14:44.638
When you're valedictorian, you're gonna crush your speech.

14:44.638 --> 14:46.807
Thank you. That's... very sweet.

14:55.249 --> 14:56.550
[Drayton] Dallas, come sit with us.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.656
Wow. Cheer's joining us.

15:02.656 --> 15:05.759
Wow. Must be your lucky day, Quarterback.

15:05.759 --> 15:07.561
So, you coming to the party tonight?

15:07.561 --> 15:09.530
Not really my scene.

15:10.331 --> 15:12.266
Well, if you change your mind,

15:12.266 --> 15:13.968
be happy to give you a ride.

15:13.968 --> 15:17.938
Unless, uh... boyfriend's the jealous type?

15:17.938 --> 15:20.441
I don't have a jealous boyfriend,

15:20.441 --> 15:22.276
because that's A) super-toxic,

15:22.276 --> 15:24.211
and B) I don't date.

15:24.211 --> 15:26.180
Not yet...

15:26.180 --> 15:27.715
but every rule has exceptions.

15:28.582 --> 15:29.984
Not this one.

15:29.984 --> 15:32.186
No, I'm outta here the day after graduation,

15:32.186 --> 15:33.187
so there's no point.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.524
I guess.

15:36.524 --> 15:39.293
But, what, you don't ever have an itch

15:39.293 --> 15:40.895
that needs to be scratched?

15:42.296 --> 15:46.066
Thanks for your concern, but I manage just fine.

15:49.937 --> 15:52.039
[Dallas] I don't know why everyone's so obsessed with him.

15:52.039 --> 15:54.108
He's not as charming as he thinks he is.

15:54.108 --> 15:55.943
[Gabby] I don't know.

15:55.943 --> 15:57.545
I sensed a vibe.

15:57.545 --> 15:59.647
Ugh!

15:59.647 --> 16:01.515
He is so smug! And cocky.

16:01.515 --> 16:03.751
And he's hooked up with half of our squad.

16:03.751 --> 16:04.985
Did you see his hickeys?

16:04.985 --> 16:06.120
Plural.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.322
Wow! Slut-shaming?

16:08.322 --> 16:09.623
That's a little off-brand.

16:09.623 --> 16:11.492
Just an observation.

16:11.492 --> 16:12.893
But... come on!

16:12.893 --> 16:15.629
Like, a jock who's never had a girlfriend?

16:15.629 --> 16:16.830
So cliché.

16:16.830 --> 16:18.732
Girl, you're so into him!

16:18.732 --> 16:20.768
It's literally obvious to everyone but you.

16:20.768 --> 16:22.503
-Ugh. -Fine.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.505
Maybe you really do hate him,

16:24.505 --> 16:26.907
but what if some other great, equally-hot guy came around?

16:26.907 --> 16:27.942
Would you give him a chance?

16:27.942 --> 16:30.444
No! Because I'm doing just fine on my own,

16:30.444 --> 16:31.478
and I don't have time for...

16:31.478 --> 16:33.480
Dallas, it's our last year.

16:33.480 --> 16:34.715
I'm in five APs, two clubs,

16:34.715 --> 16:36.150
and I said yes

16:36.150 --> 16:38.319
when Josh invited me to the party tonight.

16:38.319 --> 16:39.620
Hmm!

16:39.620 --> 16:42.189
It's almost like it's less about timing

16:42.189 --> 16:44.858
and more about not letting your guard down.

16:45.859 --> 16:47.995
Ouch.

I'm sorry.

I didn't realize we had an expiration date.

01:12:08.245 --> 01:12:11.482
Yes, you did, because that is exactly why

01:12:11.482 --> 01:12:13.384
I didn't want to date you in the first place.

01:12:13.384 --> 01:12:14.285
