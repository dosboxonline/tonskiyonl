-Hey!

15:42.107 --> 15:44.234
-I think we got something.
-Send Ryan.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.988
I don't wanna waste any more time
with bullshit leads.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.950
I don't think you'll wanna
send Ryan on this one.

15:51.033 --> 15:52.993
[foreboding music playing]

15:54.620 --> 15:56.121
You know the murder house on Morehead?

15:56.914 --> 15:57.790
Yeah.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.250
-[flames crackling]
-What about it?

16:00.334 --> 16:02.002
[foreboding music intensifies]

16:04.672 --> 16:07.800
Okay, and, uh, who exactly
was this mystery woman?

16:07.883 --> 16:08.926
Not sure.

16:09.551 --> 16:11.887
I mean, she wasn't exactly Miss Talkative.

16:11.971 --> 16:15.307
You know? I spent five minutes
trying to convince her I was real.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.267
I'm supposed to be dead, remember?

16:17.351 --> 16:19.353
Anyway, I finally get around
to half-convincing her,

16:19.436 --> 16:21.438
she starts to open up a little,
then says that she's…

16:21.522 --> 16:22.731
A friend of the doc's.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.067
Great, so am I.
Now put me on the phone with him.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.528
I'm afraid the doc is indisposed.

16:27.611 --> 16:28.946
"Indisposed"?

16:29.905 --> 16:31.115
It gets worse.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.076
She said the doc's with the girl.

16:34.159 --> 16:37.079
And the girl went off to fight
some evil in Hawkins.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.542
Then they all went off-grid.
The doc, the girl, everybody.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.545
"The girl," meaning… El.

16:45.462 --> 16:46.672
Yeah, it has to be.

16:49.091 --> 16:50.843
This is your daughter, American?

16:50.926 --> 16:52.261
Mm-hmm.

16:52.761 --> 16:53.887
And they're not alone.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.890
Joyce's kids are with 'em.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.143
[tense chord plays]

16:59.727 --> 17:01.061
[Joyce sighs]

17:03.856 --> 17:05.649
Okay, I… I see the mood here is bleak.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.776
And understandably so.

17:08.485 --> 17:11.321
But I do think we need to consider

17:11.405 --> 17:13.449
the very real possibility

17:13.532 --> 17:17.202
that this mystery woman is, in fact, KGB.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.662
-And she's--
-[Joyce] No.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.372
She's telling the truth.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.666
When we were in the lab,
those particles we saw,

17:22.750 --> 17:24.376
they were alive.

17:24.460 --> 17:28.422
And if they're alive,
that means a gate's open in Hawkins.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.758
"Gate"? What does this mean?

17:30.841 --> 17:32.926
It means we have to go home right now.

17:33.761 --> 17:36.096
What is taking so long?

17:36.180 --> 17:38.015
I thought you said he was close.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.392
Yeah, close to sabotaging us, you mean.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.394
We think he's playing us again.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.563
So put a goddamn gun to his head.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.232
And then what?
He just spits out more lies.

17:47.316 --> 17:48.650
[Murray] It's moot anyway.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.695
If your kids are truly
in some kind of imminent danger,

17:51.779 --> 17:54.490
even if we were to leave this very moment,
we wouldn't make it in time.

17:54.573 --> 17:56.575
The earliest we'd get there
is late tomorrow.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.660
No, we… we don't have to make it back.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.787
Not tonight.

17:59.870 --> 18:01.455
Whatever this evil is,

18:01.538 --> 18:03.916
we know it's connected to the hive mind.

18:03.999 --> 18:06.710
And now we know
part of that hive mind is in Russia.

18:06.794 --> 18:09.004
So we don't need
to get back to Hawkins to fight it.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.798
All we need is to destroy those particles.

18:10.881 --> 18:12.049
[Joyce] And if we're lucky,

18:12.132 --> 18:15.344
it'll hurt it enough
to give the kids the upper hand.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.512
Wait, time out.

18:17.429 --> 18:21.100
We're talking about the particles
inside the prison?

18:21.183 --> 18:23.894
The prison that
we just narrowly escaped from?

18:23.977 --> 18:25.062
We broke out.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.106
We can break back in.

18:27.689 --> 18:28.524
Jim!

18:28.607 --> 18:31.902
The entire Soviet army is looking for us.

18:31.985 --> 18:34.696
Sure. And we'll be exactly
where they least expect.

18:34.780 --> 18:38.242
All right. There is a fine line
between courage and stupidity,

18:38.325 --> 18:41.036
and this falls very far
on the side of stupid.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.496
This is Dirty Dozen stuff.

18:42.579 --> 18:44.832
Except there are, uh, four of us.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.583
Three, actually.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.003
Breaking back in's gonna be easier
than breaking out.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.006
Which is why we need an airlift.
This is where you come in.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.216
I don't care what it takes.

18:54.299 --> 18:57.094
You get Yuri in line,
and you get that bird in the air.

18:57.886 --> 18:58.846
On it.

18:59.930 --> 19:03.308
Yu… Yuri mentioned something
about a flamethrower, right?

[crate lid clatters]

[Hopper sighs]

19:09.439 --> 19:10.399
Oh, yeah.

19:10.482 --> 19:11.400
This'll do.

19:12.442 --> 19:13.819
This'll do just fine.

[tense music swells, fades]

[surfer rock guitar music playing]

19:46.393 --> 19:49.229
Surf's up, my dude.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.690
Uh, whoa.

19:52.274 --> 19:54.067
Nice shirt, my dude. [chuckles]

19:54.151 --> 19:55.402
Thanks, my dude.

19:55.485 --> 20:00.240
Uh, listen, I would love to feed
a fellow Surfer Boy,

20:00.324 --> 20:02.951
but kitchen closed, like,
five minutes ago,

20:03.035 --> 20:05.412
so no more pies tonight, man.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.164
[chuckles] That's all right, my dude.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.458
We're not here for your tasty pies.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.460
You see this weird girl behind me?

20:11.543 --> 20:14.880
She needs a tub with a bunch of salt
so we can enhance her psychic power

20:14.963 --> 20:18.342
so she can save the world
from this super bad dude.

20:18.425 --> 20:20.135
But to make this salty tub,

20:20.636 --> 20:22.179
we require your kitchen.

20:22.262 --> 20:23.263
Ah.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.892
Well, it's just, uh…

20:26.975 --> 20:29.061
I'm supposed to meet Chaz at Taco Bell

20:29.144 --> 20:31.813
in, like, ten. So…

20:35.901 --> 20:36.777
My dude.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.862
We're not asking you to help for free.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.364
You ever partake in…

20:41.490 --> 20:42.991

Not bad at all.

22:21.798 --> 22:23.050
[Eddie chuckles]

22:23.133 --> 22:24.384
Now for the fun part.

Are you ready for the most metal concert
in the history of the world?

That a rhetorical question?

[Robin] Uh…
I don't mean to freak anyone out,

23:08.470 --> 23:10.847
but I swear we've seen this tree before.

23:11.348 --> 23:13.975
-[Nancy] That's impossible.
-That would suck, right?

23:14.601 --> 23:18.605
If Vecna destroyed the world
because… 'cause we got lost in the woods?

23:18.688 --> 23:20.565
-[Nancy] We're not lost, Robin.
-[Robin chuckles]

23:20.649 --> 23:22.984
Robin, hey.
Watch out for the vines! Hive mind.

23:23.068 --> 23:24.528
-Remember?
-Thank you!

23:25.529 --> 23:27.114
[Steve] Uh, Don't worry about her.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.281
She's just stressed.

23:28.365 --> 23:29.699
You know, scared.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.618
Yeah. Yeah. I… I know.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.245
It's just…

23:33.954 --> 23:35.080
She's a super klutz?

23:35.163 --> 23:36.164
[chuckles]

23:37.666 --> 23:41.586
She did tell me that it took her
longer to walk than most babies, so…

23:41.670 --> 23:43.505
[chuckles] I really shouldn't laugh.

23:44.965 --> 23:45.882
When I was a baby,

23:45.966 --> 23:48.510
I actually crawled backwards.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.762
Crawled backwards?

23:50.846 --> 23:54.141
You know, I'd push
with my hands like this. Beep. Beep.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.560
Always in reverse, you know?

23:57.144 --> 23:59.563
Come on, it makes sense.
You push to move, right?

23:59.646 --> 24:01.940
No, no, it doesn't make sense.

24:02.023 --> 24:04.568
Well, it did
to my tiny little Harrington brain.

24:05.193 --> 24:08.363
That is, until I reversed
my baby butt down a flight of stairs

24:08.447 --> 24:10.449
and thumped my head really good.

24:10.532 --> 24:11.366
Yeah.

24:11.450 --> 24:14.494
Wow. That explains

24:15.120 --> 24:16.246
so much.

24:16.329 --> 24:17.747
Yeah. [chuckles]

24:17.831 --> 24:19.416
I think it kinda does.

24:19.499 --> 24:22.669
I think, like, right out of the gate,
like, I'm super confident.

24:22.752 --> 24:24.546
But I'm also, like, an idiot.

24:24.629 --> 24:27.048
Which is just…
I mean, it's a brutal combination.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.759
But, I mean, the good news is,

24:30.260 --> 24:33.805
I get a big enough thump on my head,
I can change, you know?

24:34.556 --> 24:35.557
I can learn.

24:36.975 --> 24:37.934
I can

24:38.685 --> 24:39.769
crawl forward.

24:39.853 --> 24:41.062
[wondrous music playing]

24:41.146 --> 24:45.817
Listen, I guess what I'm trying to say
in a really stupid, roundabout way is, um…

24:46.818 --> 24:48.904
[clicks tongue] …is thank you.

24:49.779 --> 24:50.655
Thank me?

24:50.739 --> 24:52.240
-Yeah.
-For…?

24:52.324 --> 24:54.493
For giving my head
the biggest thump of its life

24:54.576 --> 24:55.452
two years ago.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.497
I needed it.

25:00.290 --> 25:01.458
It's changed my life.

25:02.709 --> 25:05.337
And now I'm crawling forward.

25:06.880 --> 25:07.881
Slowly.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.759
I just wonder sometimes…

25:12.761 --> 25:17.098
you know, if… some other girl had given me
a proper thump before we'd met,

25:17.182 --> 25:19.434
would things have been different?

25:19.935 --> 25:23.647
Like, if we were meeting together
for the first time right now, part of me…

25:24.272 --> 25:26.691
I dunno, part of me
thinks we would've made it.

25:28.443 --> 25:29.361
Steve…

25:31.279 --> 25:32.948
Remember the dream I told you about?

25:34.950 --> 25:35.951
About the Winnebago?

25:36.034 --> 25:38.036
Seeing the country
with my six lil' nuggets?

25:40.789 --> 25:41.998
It's all true.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.124
Every last word.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.087
But I left one part out.

25:48.672 --> 25:50.173
It's the most important part.

25:53.635 --> 25:54.928
You're there.

going the wrong way after all.

[Will] Where's Lucas?

1:54:02.001 --> 1:54:03.253
He's at the hospital.

1:54:03.837 --> 1:54:04.838
Was he hurt?

1:54:05.547 --> 1:54:06.756
No. No, he's…

1:54:09.926 --> 1:54:10.844
Oh God.

1:54:11.928 --> 1:54:12.887
You don't know.

1:54:18.476 --> 1:54:23.147
[Lucas] "He opened his eyes,
and further words died in his throat."

1:54:23.231 --> 1:54:27.277
"He forgot about the need to sick up
that horrible parody of wine."

1:54:27.360 --> 1:54:29.112
"He forgot about his mother,

1:54:29.195 --> 1:54:31.573
and Uncle Morgan, and his father,

1:54:31.656 --> 1:54:33.449
and almost everything else."

1:54:33.533 --> 1:54:35.034
"Speedy was gone."

1:54:35.118 --> 1:54:38.454
"The graceful arcs of the roller coaster
against the sky were gone."

1:54:38.538 --> 1:54:41.791
"He could feel the hair stirring
on the nape of his neck,

1:54:41.875 --> 1:54:45.461
could feel a goofed-up grin
pulling at the corners of his mouth."

1:54:45.545 --> 1:54:48.089
"Speedy! I'm here, my God!"

1:54:48.172 --> 1:54:50.008
"I'm here in the territories!"

1:54:56.848 --> 1:54:57.765
[door opens]

1:54:59.267 --> 1:55:00.685
[Lucas] Oh my God.

1:55:03.688 --> 1:55:06.107
-We've been calling you guys like crazy.
-[Mike] I know.

1:55:06.608 --> 1:55:08.026
We came as soon as we heard.

1:55:13.948 --> 1:55:16.451
[breathing shakily]

1:55:19.454 --> 1:55:20.455
I'm sorry.

1:55:21.581 --> 1:55:23.333
[monitor beeping]

1:55:28.087 --> 1:55:31.132
[poignant, melancholy music playing]

1:55:53.446 --> 1:55:54.447
Do they know…

1:55:56.616 --> 1:55:57.825
when she will wake?

1:56:00.495 --> 1:56:01.496
No.

1:56:03.206 --> 1:56:04.582
They say she might not.

1:56:09.671 --> 1:56:11.130
Her heart stopped.

1:56:11.714 --> 1:56:13.174
For over a minute.

1:56:16.761 --> 1:56:17.804
She died.

1:56:20.765 --> 1:56:22.892
I… I mean, clinically, but…

1:56:23.768 --> 1:56:25.061
then she came back.

1:56:26.396 --> 1:56:28.231
[inhales deeply]

1:56:28.940 --> 1:56:30.942
The doctors don't know how.

1:56:34.070 --> 1:56:35.488
They say it's a miracle.

1:57:00.304 --> 1:57:01.889
I'm here, Max.

1:57:29.959 --> 1:57:30.877
[dramatic stinger]

1:57:32.545 --> 1:57:34.547
[crowd chattering indistinctly]

1:57:39.302 --> 1:57:41.304
[mysterious music playing]

1:58:08.289 --> 1:58:09.457
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:58:09.957 --> 1:58:12.960
Uh, so these are blankets and sheets.

1:58:13.044 --> 1:58:16.464
And some… some clothes
and… and some kids' toys.

1:58:16.547 --> 1:58:18.883
Wow. It's already so organized.

1:58:18.966 --> 1:58:19.967
We appreciate that.

1:58:20.051 --> 1:58:22.053
-Do you want a tax receipt for it?
-Um…

1:58:22.762 --> 1:58:25.473
No. I don't think that we need one.
Thank you, though.

1:58:26.766 --> 1:58:30.520
But is there anything else
that we can do to help?

1:58:34.440 --> 1:58:36.359
[volunteer] Okay, then we sort by age.

1:58:36.442 --> 1:58:40.738
We've got infants, girls,
boys, men, women…

1:58:40.822 --> 1:58:46.119
Oh, if anything is in too bad shape,
we really don't want that.

1:58:48.621 --> 1:58:51.374
I found another jar of peanut butter,
and it's crunchy…

1:58:52.750 --> 1:58:53.584
Robin.

1:58:53.668 --> 1:58:54.752
Hi.

1:58:54.836 --> 1:58:57.255
-What are you doing here?
-I am…

1:58:57.755 --> 1:58:59.882
I… I am making PB&Js.

1:58:59.966 --> 1:59:01.801
Right, yeah. No. Duh. Of course.

1:59:01.884 --> 1:59:05.012
Uh, I… I am also making PB&Js,
as it so happens.

1:59:05.096 --> 1:59:06.347
[Vickie chuckles]

1:59:06.430 --> 1:59:07.431
Cool.

1:59:17.358 --> 1:59:20.319
Hey, uh, I… I'm sorry
if that came out weird.

1:59:20.403 --> 1:59:22.655
I didn't mean it like,
"What are you doing here?"

1:59:22.738 --> 1:59:26.492
I just meant, "What are you doing here?"
Like, "Nice surprise. Great to see you."

1:59:26.576 --> 1:59:27.493
Uh…

1:59:27.577 --> 1:59:29.954
-I didn't take it as anything negative.
-Okay, good. Good.

1:59:30.037 --> 1:59:32.748
No, I… I'm sorry.
My brain's been a little frazzled lately.

1:59:32.832 --> 1:59:34.292
-'Cause--
-Of everything?

1:59:34.959 --> 1:59:36.294
Yeah. [chuckles]

1:59:36.377 --> 1:59:37.753
Yeah, and Dan.

1:59:38.254 --> 1:59:39.755
Um, he's my boyfriend.

1:59:39.839 --> 1:59:41.716
Well, was my boyfriend.

1:59:41.799 --> 1:59:43.593
He was visiting, took one look at this,

1:59:43.676 --> 1:59:46.179
and it's not what he was envisioning
for spring break.

1:59:46.262 --> 1:59:48.639
He was like, "I'm outta here.
Back to Purdue. Good luck."

1:59:48.723 --> 1:59:52.602
Which, ultimately, it's bordering on
a good thing, 'cause he was grating on me.

1:59:52.685 --> 1:59:55.521
He is the type who trashes Fast Times
'cause it has no plot.

1:59:55.605 --> 1:59:58.107
I should've just ended things
right there and then.

1:59:58.941 --> 2:00:00.067
[knife clatters]

2:00:00.151 --> 2:00:01.235
Sorry. [exhales]

2:00:02.236 --> 2:00:03.070
I'm so sorry.

2:00:03.154 --> 2:00:07.116
I am rambling about my dumb boyfriend
when there are people out there suffering.

2:00:07.200 --> 2:00:09.660
Who need… food.

2:00:11.120 --> 2:00:15.458
And I have just made a peanut butter
on peanut butter monstrosity.

2:00:15.625 --> 2:00:16.834
[Robin chuckles]

2:00:17.752 --> 2:00:18.711
Um…

2:00:18.794 --> 2:00:21.631
[tender, emotional music playing]

2:00:25.927 --> 2:00:27.720
I don't know what's wrong with me.

2:00:27.803 --> 2:00:31.515
Um, it's like sometimes my mouth
is moving faster than my brain,

2:00:31.599 --> 2:00:33.267
and it's like this runaway train,

2:00:33.351 --> 2:00:36.437
and I cannot seem to get it to stop,
no matter how hard I try.

2:00:37.355 --> 2:00:38.606
You know what I mean?

2:00:38.689 --> 2:00:41.859
Uh, yeah, I think I know what you mean.

2:00:44.487 --> 2:00:45.571
It's a gift.

2:00:45.655 --> 2:00:47.573
-Oh, for me?
-You're welcome. Mm-hmm.

2:00:47.657 --> 2:00:49.784
-You really shouldn't have.
-Oh, but I did.

2:00:49.867 --> 2:00:52.119
-I just don't even deserve it.
-But I did.

2:00:52.203 --> 2:00:54.538
-I mean, thank you.
-Early birthday.

2:00:54.622 --> 2:00:57.500
Thank you so much. Oh, oh, wow.

2:00:59.794 --> 2:01:00.920
H2O?

2:01:01.963 --> 2:01:03.547
Vital for all forms of life.

2:01:03.673 --> 2:01:05.675
[indistinct chatter]

2:01:18.604 --> 2:01:19.772
[Dustin] Mr. Munson?

2:01:25.987 --> 2:01:27.613
I'm Dustin Henderson.

2:01:27.697 --> 2:01:28.948
Can we talk?

2:01:30.032 --> 2:01:32.535
I can't imagine
we got anything to talk about.

2:01:34.161 --> 2:01:35.496
My nephew is innocent.

2:01:36.622 --> 2:01:37.790
He's still missing.

2:01:38.791 --> 2:01:41.252
I'll put up as many posters as I need
until he's found.

2:01:43.129 --> 2:01:44.171
Good day to you.

2:01:44.839 --> 2:01:45.881
I was with him.

2:01:50.761 --> 2:01:52.596
I was with him when the earthquake hit.

2:01:54.056 --> 2:01:56.642
[sorrowful synth music playing]

2:01:56.726 --> 2:01:59.061
And… where is Eddie now?

2:02:14.952 --> 2:02:16.120
[voice quavering] I'm…

2:02:16.996 --> 2:02:18.205
I'm so sorry.

2:02:23.252 --> 2:02:26.589
[gentle, heart-felt chords playing]

2:02:30.217 --> 2:02:32.595
[breathing shakily]

2:02:53.074 --> 2:02:55.368
I wish everyone had gotten to know him.

2:02:58.079 --> 2:02:59.246
Really know him.

2:03:01.665 --> 2:03:03.501
Because they would've loved him,

2:03:04.085 --> 2:03:04.919
Mr. Munson.

2:03:06.796 --> 2:03:08.005
They would've loved him.

2:03:10.299 --> 2:03:11.384
Even in the end…

2:03:13.386 --> 2:03:15.638
he never stopped being Eddie.

2:03:18.432 --> 2:03:20.434
Despite everything.

2:03:22.978 --> 2:03:24.980
I never even saw him get mad.

2:03:26.399 --> 2:03:27.566
He could've run.

2:03:28.776 --> 2:03:30.986
He could've saved himself.

2:03:33.406 --> 2:03:34.490
But he fought.

2:03:36.575 --> 2:03:40.746
He fought and died to protect this town.

2:03:41.705 --> 2:03:44.959
This town that… hated him.

2:03:46.627 --> 2:03:48.295
He isn't just innocent…

2:03:50.256 --> 2:03:51.507
Mr. Munson, he's…

2:03:53.384 --> 2:03:54.677
he's a hero.

2:03:54.760 --> 2:03:55.761
[sobs]

2:03:59.098 --> 2:04:00.099
[Mr. Munson weeps]

2:04:27.418 --> 2:04:28.419
[birds tweeting]

2:04:37.761 --> 2:04:39.263
[inhales, exhales]

2:04:47.938 --> 2:04:49.190
Oh Jesus.

2:04:51.859 --> 2:04:52.902
Holy shit.

2:04:54.153 --> 2:04:55.988
This place is a total disaster.

2:04:56.489 --> 2:04:57.323
[Jonathan] Yeah.

2:04:58.365 --> 2:05:00.117
Well, that's a bit of a problem.

2:05:00.201 --> 2:05:02.369
[Argyle] I get we gotta hide Supergirl,

2:05:02.453 --> 2:05:05.664
but this isn't exactly
the Fortress of Solitude, man.

2:05:05.748 --> 2:05:08.501
It's more like a fortress of grodiness.

2:05:08.584 --> 2:05:10.544
Come on, guys, seriously.

2:05:10.628 --> 2:05:12.755
I've seen Mike's room
look worse than this.

2:05:12.838 --> 2:05:14.173
[Argyle] Ah, brutal, dude.

2:05:14.256 --> 2:05:15.925
-[pipes rumble]
-Ah! See?

2:05:16.008 --> 2:05:17.301
Water still works.

2:05:21.222 --> 2:05:23.140
And, voilà. Cleaning supplies.

2:05:23.641 --> 2:05:25.100
[dramatic stinger]

2:05:37.404 --> 2:05:39.114
[Jonathan] All right. That's good.

2:05:39.990 --> 2:05:40.991
Hold it right there.

2:05:48.123 --> 2:05:50.292
What's he doing?

2:05:53.379 --> 2:05:55.965
[Jonathan] Looks like
he's gathering mushrooms.

2:05:56.048 --> 2:05:57.841
He's a little on the eccentric side.

2:05:57.925 --> 2:05:59.552
Welcome to the club, right?

2:05:59.635 --> 2:06:01.178
Yeah, welcome to the club.

2:06:05.266 --> 2:06:07.309
[Nancy hammering]

2:06:07.393 --> 2:06:08.811
Hey, Nancy?

2:06:08.894 --> 2:06:09.812
Yeah?

2:06:10.396 --> 2:06:11.814
I'm sorry I wasn't here.

2:06:12.606 --> 2:06:14.108
Oh. I mean…

2:06:15.651 --> 2:06:17.319
to be honest, I'm kinda glad you weren't.

2:06:17.403 --> 2:06:18.779
[tender, emotional music playing]

2:06:19.738 --> 2:06:22.408
I just mean, I'm glad you were with Mike.

2:06:22.950 --> 2:06:23.867
And Will.

2:06:23.951 --> 2:06:26.787
And I'm… I'm glad you were here too.

2:06:27.788 --> 2:06:29.248
Otherwise, who'd have been in charge?

2:06:30.040 --> 2:06:31.458
Steve? [chuckles]

2:06:32.167 --> 2:06:36.171
He's actually grown up quite a bit,
you know?

2:06:38.215 --> 2:06:39.216
Yeah.

2:06:39.300 --> 2:06:40.175
Yeah, I'm sure.

2:06:43.929 --> 2:06:44.805
Hey.

2:06:46.599 --> 2:06:47.433
Yeah?

2:06:48.601 --> 2:06:49.435
Are we okay?

2:06:52.104 --> 2:06:52.938
Yeah.

2:06:53.522 --> 2:06:54.940
-Yeah?
-Yeah, totally.

2:06:55.691 --> 2:06:56.942
Yeah, it's… it's just…

2:06:58.694 --> 2:06:59.695
You know, it's hard.

2:07:00.738 --> 2:07:01.864
I feel like

2:07:01.947 --> 2:07:04.450
life keeps throwing things
in the way of our big plans.

2:07:06.785 --> 2:07:08.162
Yeah, sure seems like that.

2:07:10.080 --> 2:07:14.168
You think it's too late to throw
"saving the world" on your college resume?

2:07:18.589 --> 2:07:20.591
Your… Your application letter…

2:07:21.717 --> 2:07:24.303
Not that it matters at all anymore, but…

2:07:25.512 --> 2:07:26.764
did it ever come?

2:07:30.726 --> 2:07:32.603
No. No, uh…

2:07:33.687 --> 2:07:34.521
Not yet.

2:07:49.828 --> 2:07:51.622
-[whooshing]
-[door creaks]

2:07:53.415 --> 2:07:55.876
Did she… talk to you at all?

2:07:56.710 --> 2:07:57.795
Not much.

2:07:57.878 --> 2:07:59.505
I mean, a little bit.

2:08:01.215 --> 2:08:02.216
[Mike sighs]

2:08:02.299 --> 2:08:03.258
Dr. Brenner.

2:08:06.929 --> 2:08:08.764
He says that she wasn't ready.

2:08:09.264 --> 2:08:11.141
And now she's starting to think
he was right.

2:08:11.225 --> 2:08:12.476
That's crap.

2:08:12.976 --> 2:08:14.978
If it wasn't for her,
if she hadn't left the lab,

2:08:15.062 --> 2:08:16.647
-Max wouldn't be alive right now.
-I know.

2:08:17.981 --> 2:08:19.191
It's just, she's, um…

2:08:20.192 --> 2:08:21.652
She's never lost before.

2:08:22.236 --> 2:08:23.278
Not like this.

2:08:23.904 --> 2:08:26.115
-She'll have another chance.
-Let's hope not.

2:08:26.198 --> 2:08:29.368
Let's hope One is dead and rotting.

2:08:30.411 --> 2:08:31.328
He's not.

2:08:32.413 --> 2:08:34.540
[haunting music playing]

2:08:34.623 --> 2:08:38.127
[voice quavering]
Now that I'm here, in Hawkins,

2:08:39.002 --> 2:08:41.004
I can feel him.

2:08:42.047 --> 2:08:43.465
And he's hurt.

2:08:43.549 --> 2:08:44.758
He's hurting.

2:08:46.135 --> 2:08:48.011
But he's still alive.
