WEBVTT

01:03.750 --> 01:05.791
[groans] Ow!

01:05.875 --> 01:09.333
[Crosshair] Did you think wrestling
that creature was a good idea?

01:09.416 --> 01:11.750
At the time, yes.

01:11.833 --> 01:13.750
[Hunter] The base is five klicks away.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.375
Can you make it?

01:15.458 --> 01:17.375
[scoffs] Try and stop me.

01:17.916 --> 01:19.125
[groans]

01:31.083 --> 01:34.125
[alarm blaring]

01:38.208 --> 01:41.625
Guard the vault
until the security lockdown is lifted.

01:44.125 --> 01:46.958
[Scorch] Dr. Hemlock,
one of the insurgents has been captured.

01:52.500 --> 01:53.916
[alarm continues]

01:59.541 --> 02:02.750
Aligning yourself with insurgent clones.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.791
[sighs] Not a good look, Rampart.

02:05.875 --> 02:07.500
You're surprisingly calm,

02:07.583 --> 02:12.958
considering this secure and secret
facility… [laughs] …has been compromised.

02:13.041 --> 02:16.625
I can't imagine
the Emperor will be pleased about that.

02:17.250 --> 02:18.916
All that time you spent on Kamino,

02:19.000 --> 02:21.416
yet you learned nothing
about how clones think.

02:22.333 --> 02:25.791
I knew Clone Force 99 would
eventually attempt to recover Omega.

02:25.875 --> 02:28.458
Their failure is inevitable.

02:29.291 --> 02:31.541
All this for the young clone.

02:32.208 --> 02:33.208
[chuckles]

02:33.291 --> 02:36.250
I fail to see how she's of value to you.

02:36.333 --> 02:39.041
What I am working on
is beyond your understanding.

02:39.125 --> 02:43.958
Something so vital to the Empire,
it makes me indispensable.

02:44.541 --> 02:45.958
Unlike yourself.

02:53.666 --> 02:55.333
[door closes]

02:55.416 --> 02:57.708
[alarm blaring]

02:57.791 --> 02:59.791
The longer this lockdown continues,

02:59.875 --> 03:01.958
the higher the chance
you'll be discovered.

03:02.041 --> 03:04.375
We need to move. Now.

03:04.458 --> 03:07.791
Why can't I find any record
of the vault Omega's held in?

03:07.875 --> 03:10.000
These databanks are heavily encrypted.

03:10.083 --> 03:11.916
The vault is several levels down.

03:12.000 --> 03:15.875
Hemlock keeps it under heavy guard,
but I can get you inside.

03:17.458 --> 03:20.375
Why are you helping me?

03:21.041 --> 03:23.041
Because I was wrong about this place.

03:24.291 --> 03:28.291
And… [inhales sharply]
…I'm trying to do the right thing.

03:32.958 --> 03:35.458
[alarm blaring]

03:39.708 --> 03:42.708
[Eva] You want us to do what?

03:42.791 --> 03:44.583
It's how we're going to escape.

03:45.333 --> 03:47.291
But it sounds dangerous.

03:47.375 --> 03:49.708
My squad I told you about?

03:49.791 --> 03:50.875
They're here.

03:51.833 --> 03:57.166
If we can get out of this room
and find them, we can all go home.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.833
You really think this will work?

03:59.916 --> 04:01.458
I'll make sure of it.

04:01.541 --> 04:03.166
I've been trained for this.

04:03.916 --> 04:05.333
Let's get into position.

04:24.833 --> 04:25.666
[giggles]

04:33.250 --> 04:35.041
My game is broken.

04:35.125 --> 04:36.375
Can you fix it?

04:36.458 --> 04:38.708
[droid] That is not
part of my programming.

04:38.791 --> 04:40.791
[groans, powers down]

04:53.833 --> 04:55.583
-[droid] Error.
-Dr. Scalder's on her way.

04:55.666 --> 04:56.875
-Hurry.
-[droid] Err-Error.

04:56.958 --> 04:58.583
[Jax] You've done this before, right?

04:58.666 --> 05:00.833
Yes, but not on this type of droid.

05:05.708 --> 05:07.291
Where are the others?

05:09.708 --> 05:12.791
SP-39, I asked you a question.

05:13.458 --> 05:14.458
[footsteps approaching]

05:16.333 --> 05:18.416
We w-were with the droid.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.833
[sighs] Another scan wasn't scheduled.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.583
Tell me what you were really doing.

05:24.666 --> 05:26.458
Eva's telling the truth.

05:26.541 --> 05:28.208
We were with the droid.

05:28.791 --> 05:31.250
Dr. Karr has been
too lenient with you all.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.750
Return to your alcoves.

05:33.833 --> 05:36.750
A few days of isolation
should remind you-- [grunts]

05:38.083 --> 05:39.708
-[gasps] It worked.
-[giggles]

05:39.791 --> 05:41.208
You did great.

05:41.291 --> 05:42.500
Now we have to hurry.

05:42.583 --> 05:44.250
Droid, guard the door.

05:44.333 --> 05:46.375
Sami, prep the sling for Bayrn.

05:53.708 --> 05:54.958
[Bayrn coos]

06:07.000 --> 06:08.416
-Ready?
-[Jax] Ready.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.291
[ships flying over]

06:24.041 --> 06:26.458
[Wrecker groaning]

06:26.541 --> 06:28.958
[Crosshair] He's gonna need
another med patch.

06:29.041 --> 06:30.375
[Hunter] We're out.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.166
[Wrecker groans] I-I can make it.

06:54.791 --> 06:58.083
[Echo] The kids who are held in here,
where'd they come from?

06:58.166 --> 07:01.291
The Empire used bounty hunters
to retrieve them.

07:02.208 --> 07:07.000
Their genetic material was required
for certain medical testing.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.708
I didn't know about them until recently.

07:09.791 --> 07:12.791
I couldn't help them. Until now.

07:12.875 --> 07:15.958
[Echo] Well,
how does Omega fit into all this?

07:16.041 --> 07:19.833
She's vital to Hemlock's main objective
for the Emperor.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.375
Project Necromancer.

07:24.250 --> 07:26.083
[Echo] Don't like the sound of that.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.291
[Bayrn whimpers]

07:40.375 --> 07:41.875
[Omega] Everybody good?

07:41.958 --> 07:45.583
Bayrn's getting restless.
H-He won't be quiet for much longer.

07:45.666 --> 07:49.875
Don't worry.
Things are about to get very loud anyways.

07:50.875 --> 07:53.708
[medical personnel chattering]

07:54.375 --> 07:55.583
Wait here.

07:56.166 --> 07:58.166
[console beeping]

08:23.958 --> 08:28.166
[Bayrn crying]

08:28.250 --> 08:29.958
Get him to stop.

08:30.041 --> 08:31.208
I'm trying.

08:32.708 --> 08:33.833
[stormtrooper] You hear that?

08:33.916 --> 08:35.416
Find out where that's coming from.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.000
[beeping]

08:40.250 --> 08:41.583
[system powering up]

08:49.500 --> 08:51.541
-[gasps] Hi.
-[crying]

08:51.625 --> 08:53.833
[sighs] Step out of there.

08:53.916 --> 08:55.375
[stammers] Um--

08:57.125 --> 08:58.458
[growls]

08:58.541 --> 09:00.333
[medical assistant] What's the situation?

09:00.416 --> 09:02.958
[stormtrooper] It's children, sir.
What do we do?

09:03.041 --> 09:04.708
[sighs] Get them out of there!

09:05.333 --> 09:07.416
[Zillo Beast growls]

09:07.500 --> 09:08.500
[gasps]

09:13.333 --> 09:14.333
[groans]

09:17.125 --> 09:20.541
-Initiate containment protocols.
-[Zillo Beast roars]

09:25.708 --> 09:27.083
[roars]

09:34.375 --> 09:36.125

09:37.583 --> 09:38.583
[blasters firing]

09:45.250 --> 09:46.250

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
[datapad beeps]

09:51.416 --> 09:52.666
[Scalder groans]

09:54.583 --> 09:56.333
What's going on in here?

09:56.416 --> 09:58.791
Omega and the specimens have escaped.

09:59.291 --> 10:01.333
Due to Dr. Scalder's incompetence,

10:01.416 --> 10:03.625
they exploited a weak point
within the walls.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.708
She will be dealt with.

10:05.791 --> 10:07.958
-[rumbling]
-[power surges]

10:08.583 --> 10:09.583
[comm beeps]

10:09.666 --> 10:10.916
[chattering on comm]

10:11.916 --> 10:13.750
The Zillo's loose
in the containment level.

10:15.333 --> 10:18.666
Shut down the reactor, and send a division
to secure the transport hangar.

10:19.833 --> 10:21.750
Find Omega, Dr. Karr.

10:22.333 --> 10:24.166
Consider your fate now tied to hers.

10:28.041 --> 10:29.541
I don't understand.

10:29.625 --> 10:31.375
Where could the children have gone?

10:32.791 --> 10:34.000
[Echo] Omega.

10:34.708 --> 10:36.708
She released the Zillo.

10:36.791 --> 10:38.500
How do you know that?

10:38.583 --> 10:40.625
[Echo] Because it's exactly what I'd do.

10:41.541 --> 10:44.583
She's splitting their numbers
and creating a diversion.

10:44.666 --> 10:45.750
Come on.

10:53.916 --> 10:55.583
[electricity crackling]

11:00.416 --> 11:01.833
[screaming]

11:06.416 --> 11:08.666
[Zillo Beast roars]

11:10.458 --> 11:13.791
[Bayrn snoring]

11:13.875 --> 11:15.583
This puts him to sleep?

11:15.666 --> 11:16.666
[sighs]

11:16.750 --> 11:19.500
[roars]

11:29.500 --> 11:31.500
[roars]

11:33.833 --> 11:35.875
[alarm blaring]

11:41.083 --> 11:43.416
[Zillo Beast roars]

12:01.208 --> 12:03.875
[panting, grunts]

12:05.166 --> 12:08.958
They've got heavy patrols guarding
the perimeter with lurca hounds.

12:09.041 --> 12:11.125
[Wrecker] Told you
we should've brought Batcher.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.541
[chuckles, groaning]

12:13.625 --> 12:15.041
Stop looking at me like that!

12:15.125 --> 12:17.375
I'm fine! [groans]

12:17.458 --> 12:18.958
[Crosshair] No, you're not.

12:19.791 --> 12:21.208
Change of plans.

12:21.291 --> 12:24.750
You two, head to the communications array
and try to contact Rex.

12:25.416 --> 12:27.708
I'll infiltrate the base myself.

12:27.791 --> 12:28.875
[Hunter] Not happening.

12:28.958 --> 12:32.291
[Wrecker] Yeah,
we've handled worse situations than this.

12:32.375 --> 12:34.166
-Countless--
-[Crosshair] Wake up, Wrecker.

12:34.250 --> 12:36.625
Clone Force 99 died with Tech.

12:37.375 --> 12:39.625
We're not that squad anymore.

12:40.416 --> 12:42.375
I've been inside that mountain.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.291
I know what we're up against.

12:44.375 --> 12:47.583
If we all go in,
we're not all making it out.

12:48.541 --> 12:50.208
Omega needs you both.

12:51.125 --> 12:54.250
So, I'm doing this alone.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.708
It's--

12:58.125 --> 12:59.458
It's what I deserve.

13:00.166 --> 13:02.666
[Hunter] Don't even think
about Plan 99, Crosshair.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.875
Omega needs all of us,
and so do those clones.

13:07.583 --> 13:09.708
[Wrecker] We've always known the risks.

13:09.791 --> 13:11.000
And so did Tech.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.708
We do this together.

13:14.583 --> 13:16.583
[Zillo Beast roars in distance]

13:17.541 --> 13:19.541
[lurca hound barks]

13:19.625 --> 13:21.458
[whines]

13:22.041 --> 13:24.041
[Wrecker sighs] What's going on?

13:24.125 --> 13:25.541
[banging]

13:39.291 --> 13:41.625
[roaring]

13:46.250 --> 13:48.083
[roaring]

13:48.708 --> 13:51.291
[Crosshair] Echo's handiwork or Omega's?

13:51.875 --> 13:52.958
[Hunter, Wrecker] Omega.

13:58.916 --> 14:01.916
[Hunter] If she's giving us a way in,
let's not waste it.

14:17.666 --> 14:18.750
[Omega] Over here.

14:22.791 --> 14:25.916
You want us to climb up t-that?

14:26.000 --> 14:27.416
The Zillo got out this way.

14:28.250 --> 14:29.500
So can we.

14:30.291 --> 14:31.375
What's wrong?

14:31.458 --> 14:34.041
I'm not good with heights.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.875
I-I guess I'd make a poor soldier.

14:37.541 --> 14:39.666
My brother Wrecker hates heights too.

14:40.208 --> 14:43.041
And he's the strongest soldier I know.

14:44.166 --> 14:47.000
Just stay focused on what's ahead,
not what's below.

15:09.166 --> 15:10.791
[alarm blaring]

15:14.958 --> 15:17.416
[Scorch] The Zillo breached the bay doors
and fled to the jungle

15:17.500 --> 15:20.125
after wiping out
two full divisions of troopers.

15:20.208 --> 15:21.625
We need reinforcements.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.916
Send the shuttles after the Zillo.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.000
[Scorch] But, sir,

15:26.083 --> 15:30.125
without air support, the rogue clones
could exploit our weakened defenses.

15:30.208 --> 15:31.583
Of course they will.

15:31.666 --> 15:32.791
Do it.

15:36.833 --> 15:40.250

16:48.958 --> 16:50.625
[Echo] We're on the right track.

16:50.708 --> 16:52.583
Omega definitely came through here.

16:52.666 --> 16:54.083
And went where?

16:54.166 --> 16:56.333
How are they getting around unseen?

16:59.791 --> 17:01.791
[Echo] What's at the top of this shaft?

17:03.458 --> 17:06.083
It leads up to
one of the transport hangars.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.791
[Echo] Any chance you know a shortcut?

17:07.875 --> 17:09.875

17:45.208 --> 17:46.333
[Wrecker] What now?

18:00.583 --> 18:02.166
-How many?
-[Crosshair] Too many.

18:02.250 --> 18:04.208
[Wrecker] W-We can take 'em.

18:04.291 --> 18:05.541
[Crosshair] No, we can't.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.291
Not in your condition.

18:07.375 --> 18:08.708
We need to fall back.

18:08.791 --> 18:11.166
-[Hunter] Crosshair--

[Crosshair groaning]

19:28.333 --> 19:33.750
[clone commando] You should be
more careful with your shooting hand.

19:38.708 --> 19:40.208
[Omega pants]

19:43.416 --> 19:45.166
What was all that blaster fire?

19:45.833 --> 19:48.916
I don't know,
but it sounds like it's over.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.416
And we can't stay here.

19:51.583 --> 19:52.916
Just a little bit further.

20:20.250 --> 20:21.958
Is that the rest of your squad?

20:22.041 --> 20:24.375
[Echo] Yeah. Where are they being taken?

20:24.875 --> 20:25.958
I don't know.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.583
But Hemlock will keep them well guarded.

20:28.666 --> 20:30.750
[Echo] I can handle that.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.875
But we have to find the children first.

20:35.791 --> 20:37.375
The science hangar is up ahead.

20:46.041 --> 20:47.416
Do you see your squad?

20:50.375 --> 20:51.458
Not yet.

20:51.541 --> 20:54.000
[stormtrooper] Hey! You don't belong here.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.250
Call it in.

20:57.458 --> 20:58.500
[grunts]

20:59.333 --> 21:01.250
Causing chaos, Havoc 5?

21:01.333 --> 21:02.208
Echo?

21:03.291 --> 21:04.291
Hey, kid.

21:05.625 --> 21:07.666
And other kids.

21:07.750 --> 21:10.208
The shuttles in bay four
are still operational.

21:10.291 --> 21:12.625
You're helping us, Dr. Karr?

21:12.708 --> 21:14.583
I am. But we must hurry.

21:28.666 --> 21:31.333
Wait. Where are Hunter,
Wrecker and Crosshair?

21:31.416 --> 21:33.375
[Echo] They're detained.

21:33.458 --> 21:35.375
-You mean captured?
-[Echo] For now.

21:36.125 --> 21:37.625
Can you fly that shuttle?

21:37.708 --> 21:39.333
Yes. Why?

21:39.416 --> 21:41.416
[Echo] Take the kids to these coordinates.

21:41.500 --> 21:43.083
We'll meet you there.

21:43.166 --> 21:44.958
You're not coming with us?

21:45.041 --> 21:48.416
There are more prisoners inside,
including my brothers.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.333
I can't leave without them.

21:53.583 --> 21:55.166
-Don't worry.
-[Bayrn coos]

21:55.250 --> 21:57.416
Emerie's taking you someplace safe.

21:58.916 --> 21:59.958
We'll meet you there.

22:01.166 --> 22:04.791
Here. This will help you access
all wings of the facility.

22:08.041 --> 22:09.291
Look after them.

22:10.583 --> 22:11.750
You have my word.

22:13.083 --> 22:14.750
Be careful, Omega.

22:27.833 --> 22:29.041
[Echo] You ready?

22:30.708 --> 22:32.166
Let's complete the mission.

22:44.208 --> 22:45.791
[electricity crackling]

22:45.875 --> 22:49.708
[groaning]

22:52.250 --> 22:53.458
[grunts]

22:54.166 --> 22:55.833
[panting]

22:58.000 --> 23:02.958
The last time we crossed paths,
you had just lost a member of your squad.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.250
And it appears history may repeat itself.

23:09.333 --> 23:13.583
CT-9904 resisted my conditioning
in the past,

23:13.666 --> 23:18.375
but I've made alterations to my methods.

23:19.000 --> 23:24.375
If you all survive,
you will make fine operatives.

23:25.416 --> 23:29.875
And if not, well, there's no shortage
of clones to test on next.

23:30.875 --> 23:32.125
We'll survive.

23:33.041 --> 23:34.416
But you won't.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.750
[screaming, groaning]

23:39.833 --> 23:43.166
Doctor, there is an incoming transmission
from Governor Tarkin.

23:44.958 --> 23:48.541
[Hunter screaming, groaning continues]

23:51.458 --> 23:53.041
[muffled blaster fire]

23:54.250 --> 23:55.166
[groans]

24:16.833 --> 24:19.250
-[datapad beeps]
-[prisoner] Hey, kid.

24:19.333 --> 24:20.541
What's going on?

24:20.625 --> 24:22.000
[Omega] We're breaking out.

24:22.083 --> 24:22.916
[beeping]

24:26.041 --> 24:27.041
Here.

24:29.375 --> 24:30.541
I'll look for the others.

24:34.375 --> 24:35.375
Nala Se!

24:35.458 --> 24:39.750
Omega, why did you come back
to this place?

24:39.833 --> 24:41.666
I had to, but it's okay.

24:41.750 --> 24:43.375
We're all getting out this time.

24:47.041 --> 24:49.708
[sighs] We gave up hope
that anyone was coming to help us.

24:49.791 --> 24:52.083
We've been looking for this base
for a while.

24:52.625 --> 24:54.625
Echo, I searched all the cells.

24:54.708 --> 24:55.791
They're not here.

24:55.875 --> 24:56.875
Who?

24:56.958 --> 24:58.458
The rest of our squad.

24:58.541 --> 25:00.500
They were grabbed by Hemlock's operatives.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.041
Where else would he take them?

25:02.125 --> 25:04.208
Well, they could be in the training room.

25:04.708 --> 25:08.250
It's where Hemlock conditions
the clones he deems useful.

25:08.333 --> 25:10.083
I think I know where that is.

25:10.166 --> 25:11.958
-Follow me.
-[Rampart] Are you joking?

25:12.041 --> 25:15.041
The wisest course of action
is to leave while we can.

25:15.125 --> 25:17.791
Clones don't leave our brothers behind.

25:20.208 --> 25:23.833
Listen, I know
you've all been through enough.

25:24.500 --> 25:26.291
You deserve your freedom.

25:26.958 --> 25:29.291
But Omega and I can't do this alone.

25:30.041 --> 25:32.708
Is anyone willing to stand with us?

25:35.666 --> 25:37.625
I will. [sighs]

25:37.708 --> 25:41.000
-I've got one more fight left in me.
-Me too.

25:41.083 --> 25:42.541
-I'll stand with you.
-[prisoner] Yeah!

25:42.625 --> 25:43.625
Good.

25:43.708 --> 25:46.958
You two, get the injured to the hangar
and secure a shuttle.

25:47.041 --> 25:50.208
I'll trigger an alert in a different wing
and reroute their troops.

25:50.291 --> 25:52.291
The rest of you, grab any weapon you can.

25:53.333 --> 25:54.333
[Nala Se] Omega,

25:56.083 --> 26:02.625
I must not allow my science
to remain in the Empire's hands.

26:02.708 --> 26:08.000
The only way you will be free
is if Hemlock is gone

26:08.083 --> 26:11.166
and the databanks are destroyed.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.583
Then let's get to the lab.

26:13.458 --> 26:14.458
No.

26:15.083 --> 26:18.458
Your place is with them.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.000
You'll need this.

26:43.500 --> 26:46.041
[Tarkin] I hear you've lost control
of the Zillo Beast

26:46.125 --> 26:48.625
and that your facility is under threat.

26:48.708 --> 26:51.041
The Emperor is most concerned.

26:51.125 --> 26:54.041
I have the situation under control.

26:54.125 --> 26:55.125
Do you?

26:55.875 --> 26:57.166
We shall soon see.

26:57.708 --> 26:59.958
You can expect my arrival shortly.

27:05.333 --> 27:08.041
[stormtrooper 1] Prisoners have engaged
troopers in levels five and seven.

27:10.041 --> 27:11.041
[stormtrooper 3 grunts]

27:12.083 --> 27:14.750
The training floor's
two more corridors over.

27:14.833 --> 27:17.375
[Echo] The pneumatic tube system
runs throughout this base.

27:17.458 --> 27:19.958
Think you can use it
to get eyes inside that room?

27:20.041 --> 27:21.500
It worked in the vault.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.500
[alarm blaring]

27:27.041 --> 27:31.208
Relay what you see, but stay out of sight
until we're in position.

27:31.291 --> 27:32.666
Roger that.

28:38.666 --> 28:39.875
Step aside.

28:41.833 --> 28:46.916
I'm curious. What research could be
of such value to the Emperor?

28:49.166 --> 28:50.958
[typing]

28:52.541 --> 28:53.791
[device beeping]

28:54.416 --> 28:59.875

about Project Necromancer.

29:21.250 --> 29:22.333
-[comm beeps]
-Echo,

29:22.416 --> 29:24.958
I have a visual on Hunter,
Wrecker and Crosshair.

29:25.041 --> 29:28.208
There's an operative on guard,
but I don't see the others.

29:28.291 --> 29:31.458
I might be able to free them
if you give me a big enough distraction.

29:31.541 --> 29:33.291
-[Echo] We're on our way.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.083
[grunting]

30:57.250 --> 31:02.416
A glaring weakness in clones
is their loyalty to one another.

31:03.500 --> 31:05.166
Thank you for proving my point.

31:09.375 --> 31:10.750
[firing continues]

[prisoners coughing]

31:23.375 --> 31:26.541
This has been very enlightening.

31:26.625 --> 31:29.125
Who knew a child could be so valuable?

31:29.208 --> 31:34.291
You never understood
the complexities of cloning.

31:34.375 --> 31:37.416
Oh, your science means nothing to me.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.416
It's a mere bargaining chip.

31:39.500 --> 31:41.791
And if this is as vital as Hemlock said,

31:42.416 --> 31:46.583
the Empire should be willing
to give me anything to get it back.

31:46.666 --> 31:53.250
My work will never belong to you
or the Empire.

31:53.916 --> 31:57.583
It will always be Kaminoan.

31:57.666 --> 31:58.666
[Rampart] Hmm.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.625
-[blaster clicks]
-Not any longer.

32:44.083 --> 32:45.208
Predictably so.

32:47.041 --> 32:49.708
[Scorch] Sir, there's been an explosion
in the central lab.

32:49.791 --> 32:51.041
It's been destroyed.

32:56.208 --> 32:57.708
You failed too.

32:58.333 --> 33:00.125
Your data's gone.

33:00.625 --> 33:02.291
But I still have you.

33:04.708 --> 33:06.041
You're forgetting one thing.

33:07.208 --> 33:09.041
I have them.

You won't get past them.

They won't risk hurting you.

37:03.583 --> 37:04.875
Neither will you.

They're too close.

37:42.083 --> 37:45.666
If I'm off-- I can't risk Omega.

37:46.250 --> 37:48.083
She knows what to do, Crosshair.

I have completed my assessment.

perished in the attack.

40:03.875 --> 40:05.833
Was any of his research salvageable?

40:06.500 --> 40:07.875
No, Governor.

40:08.500 --> 40:10.583
The databanks were destroyed.

40:12.583 --> 40:15.000
Hemlock's failings have cost us enough.

40:16.458 --> 40:18.750
Shutter this facility indefinitely,

40:18.833 --> 40:23.125
and redistribute all funding
to Project Stardust.

40:45.416 --> 40:48.041
[birds chirping]

40:55.666 --> 40:57.083
[moon-yos chattering]

41:02.833 --> 41:04.416
[Emerie] They've adapted quickly.

41:05.333 --> 41:06.750
Kids are resilient.

41:07.958 --> 41:11.708
A childhood's not something we ever had.

41:13.083 --> 41:15.125
Our lives have never been our own.

41:15.208 --> 41:16.583
Until now.

41:18.750 --> 41:22.416
I'm heading to Pantora
to help get some of the clones settled.

41:22.500 --> 41:27.166
I'm sure Senator Chuchi would find what
you have to say very helpful to our cause.

41:28.250 --> 41:29.791
I have a lot to make up for.

41:30.708 --> 41:32.791
I'd like to help out however I can.

41:51.875 --> 41:54.791
With Hemlock gone and his data destroyed,

41:55.500 --> 41:57.333
they're finally safe.

41:57.416 --> 41:58.416
Mm-hmm.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.750
[sighs] And so are you.

42:02.500 --> 42:05.208
[Omega] Will it take long
to find their families?

42:07.250 --> 42:10.666
Rex and I are working on it,

42:10.750 --> 42:13.291
but we'll look after them until then.

42:16.125 --> 42:19.291
[ship powering up]

42:39.250 --> 42:41.333
What about the rest of the clones?

42:41.875 --> 42:43.625
Will they stay here on Pabu?

42:44.708 --> 42:47.333
Well, it's up to them.

42:48.458 --> 42:50.458
They're free to follow their own paths.

42:52.666 --> 42:55.375
We've all fought enough battles
for one lifetime.

42:55.916 --> 42:59.708
Now we get to choose who we want to be.

43:01.041 --> 43:02.500
Like what?

43:05.375 --> 43:06.833
Whatever we want, kid.

43:08.208 --> 43:09.208
[sighs]

43:09.875 --> 43:11.125
Whatever we want.

43:52.166 --> 43:55.166
[ship horn blows]

44:04.625 --> 44:06.625
[creatures chittering]

44:31.708 --> 44:34.416
[switch clicking, beeps]

44:34.500 --> 44:37.416
[lights clicking on]

44:37.500 --> 44:39.708
[barking]

44:49.375 --> 44:50.958
[Gonky honks]

44:51.666 --> 44:53.500
Thought you could just sneak off?

44:55.458 --> 44:57.916
Time hasn't dulled all my senses.

44:58.875 --> 45:01.500
[chuckles] This shouldn't be a surprise.

45:03.166 --> 45:06.125
The Rebellion needs pilots now
more than ever.

45:07.958 --> 45:08.958
[sighs]

45:11.125 --> 45:12.958
I made my choice, Hunter.

45:14.125 --> 45:15.500
I want to do more.

45:16.000 --> 45:19.250
And we want to keep you safe.

45:19.333 --> 45:21.000
[chuckles] You have.

45:21.625 --> 45:23.541
But I'm not a kid anymore.

45:23.625 --> 45:25.375
You don't have to worry about me.

45:26.750 --> 45:28.291
You're our kid, Omega.

45:29.750 --> 45:31.000
You always will be.

45:34.416 --> 45:35.666
Hunter,

45:36.625 --> 45:38.291
you've all fought enough.

45:40.541 --> 45:41.541
This?

45:42.083 --> 45:43.541
It's my fight.

45:44.250 --> 45:45.333
I'm ready.

45:49.166 --> 45:51.416
[sighs] Yeah, I know you are.

45:53.541 --> 45:55.125
[sighs] But I'm not.

46:06.125 --> 46:08.458
Keep an eye on Wrecker and Crosshair
while I'm gone.

46:09.166 --> 46:10.416
[chuckles] Batcher too.

46:12.958 --> 46:14.375
Off you go.

46:18.708 --> 46:19.791
[Batcher pants]

46:26.500 --> 46:27.625
Omega.

46:29.625 --> 46:30.833
If you ever need us,

46:32.583 --> 46:33.625
we'll be there.

46:38.625 --> 46:40.208
[Gonky honks]

46:43.333 --> 46:46.708
[ship powering up]

46:51.666 --> 46:52.958
[beeping]

47:06.791 --> 47:09.458
[Batcher whining]

47:10.250 --> 47:11.666
It's all right, girl.

47:15.250 --> 47:16.916
-[beeps]
-[Batcher whines]

47:17.000 --> 47:19.250
-[lights clicking off]
-She'll be fine.
