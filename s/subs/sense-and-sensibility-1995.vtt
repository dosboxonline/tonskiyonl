You will find out soon enough
from my will...

01:24.167 --> 01:27.091
that the estate of Norland
was left to me...

01:27.170 --> 01:30.094
in such a way
as prevents me...

01:30.173 --> 01:33.097
from dividing it
between my two families.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.304
Calm yourself, Father.
This cannot be good for you.

01:35.387 --> 01:38.766
Nofland,
in its entirety,

01:38.849 --> 01:43.104

But your stepmother,

01:52.613 --> 01:55.116
my wife and daughters,

01:55.198 --> 01:59.453
are left only £500 a year-
barely enough to live on.

01:59.536 --> 02:02.039
Nothing for the girls' dowries.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.636
You must help them.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.180
O-Of course.

02:10.255 --> 02:13.555
You must promise to do this.

I promise.

[Fanny] “Help them”? What
do you mean, “help them”?

02:24.061 --> 02:27.315
Dearest, I mean
to give them £3,000.

02:27.397 --> 02:31.072
The interest will provide them
with a little extra income.

02:31.151 --> 02:35.327
Such a gift will certainly
discharge my promise to my father.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.908
Without question.
More than amply.

Well, they can hardly

[John] A hundred pounds a year to
their mother, while she lives.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.202
Would that be
more advisable?

03:14.277 --> 03:16.951
It is better than parting
with the 1,500 all at once.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.453
But if she should live
longer than 15 years,

03:32.713 --> 03:34.636
Indeed.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.888
Although, to say the truth,
l'm convinced within myself...

03:36.967 --> 03:40.016
that your father had no idea
of your giving them money.

03:40.095 --> 03:43.019
They will have 500 a year
amongst them as it is.

03:43.098 --> 03:46.022
And what on earth could four
women want for more than that?

03:46.101 --> 03:48.024
Their housekeeping
will be nothing at all.

03:48.103 --> 03:52.028
They'll have no carriage, no horses, hardly
any servants and will keep no company.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.848

Oh, good-bye!

[ Murmuring ]
Oh, here you are!

29:24.096 --> 29:27.020
Come on, boys. Come on.
Come along.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.077
Your feet are cold.

30:08.557 --> 30:10.480
[ Marianne ]
What have you been doing?

30:10.559 --> 30:13.483
Your neck is so dirty
you could grow a potato on it.

[Gasps]
lt's cold. l'm cold.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.447
Hot. Thank you, Elinor.

It's hot.

manage it, Margaret?

[Chattering ]

30:28.577 --> 30:30.500
[ Sir John ]
Where can Brandon be?

30:30.579 --> 30:33.503
Poor fellow. I hope he's
not lamed his horse.

30:33.582 --> 30:36.927
Colonel Brandon is the most
eligible bachelor in the county.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.505
[Sir John ] Yes, indeed. He's
bound to do for one of you.

30:39.588 --> 30:43.183
- [ Chuckling ] - Mind, I think he's
a better age for Miss Dashwood.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.010
[Sir John Laughs]

30:45.093 --> 30:48.267
But I dare say, she's left her
heart behind in Sussex, hmm?

30:48.347 --> 30:52.227
- [Sir John Chuckles] Oh-ho-ho!
- I see you, Miss Marianne.

30:52.309 --> 30:54.687
I think
l've unearthed a secret.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.694
Sniffed one out already? You're worse
than my best pointer, Flossie!

30:59.358 --> 31:02.032
What sort of man is he,
Miss Dashwood?

31:02.110 --> 31:05.205
Butcher? Baker?
Candlestick maker?

31:05.280 --> 31:08.955
- I shall winkle it out of you, you know.
- She's horribly good at winkling.

31:09.034 --> 31:13.210
You're in lonely country now, Miss Dashwood.
VVe none of us have any secrets here.

- Or if we do, we do not keep them long.
- [ Mrs. Jennings Laughing ]

31:17.793 --> 31:22.549
- He's curate of the parish, I dare say.
- Or perhaps a handsome lieutenant.

31:22.631 --> 31:26.807
- Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood. ls he
in uniform? - He has no profession.

31:26.885 --> 31:29.388
- Oh. - [ Sir John
] No profession.

31:29.471 --> 31:31.394
Uh, he's a gentleman, then.

31:31.473 --> 31:35.853
Margaret, you know perfectly
well there is no such person.

31:35.936 --> 31:39.190
There is! There is, and
his name begins with an

- An “F” indeed!

- There's a promising letter. “F,” “For!
- Uh, Foster?

- There's one!
- Uh, Forrest? Fotheringay?

- Oh, yes, l- l- Fortescue!

- Fondant?
- [ Both Laughing ]

your pianoforte?

31:59.668 --> 32:02.512
Yes, yes, of course.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.260
My goodness.

32:04.339 --> 32:07.559
Yes, we do not stand
upon ceremony here, my dear.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.559

Wasn't that love-

where have you been?

33:37.432 --> 33:39.981
Come, come and meet our
beautiful new neighbors!

33:40.060 --> 33:42.358
But what a pity
you're late, Colonel.

33:42.437 --> 33:46.317
You have not heard our delightful
songbird Miss Marianne.

33:46.399 --> 33:48.777
A great pleasure
indeed.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.034
Mrs. Dashwood, may I present my
dear friend Colonel Brandon.

33:52.113 --> 33:56.789
VVe served in the East Indies together. I assure
you there's not a better fellow in the world.

33:56.868 --> 34:00.372
- Have you really been to the
East Indies, Colonel? -lhave.

34:00.455 --> 34:03.959
- What's it like?
- Like? Hot.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.841
The air is full of spices.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.547
- [All Chuckling ] - [ Mrs.

34:09.630 --> 34:12.635
Now, Miss Dashwood,
it's your turn to entertain us.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.391
Oh, no, Sir John,
I don't-

34:15.469 --> 34:19.190
And I believe I know
what key you will sing in:

F Major.

34:21.268 --> 34:25.364
[ Snickering,

34:34.406 --> 34:38.581
And as for you, you have no right to
parade your ignorant assumptions-

34:38.659 --> 34:41.163
They're not assumptions.
You told me.

34:42.664 --> 34:46.714
I told you nothing. They'll
meet him when he comes anyway.

34:46.793 --> 34:50.422
Margaret, that is not the point. You do not
speak of such things before strangers.

34:50.505 --> 34:54.179
But everyone else was. Mrs.
Jennings is not everyone.

34:54.259 --> 34:57.354
I like her.
She talks about things.

34:57.429 --> 35:00.729
VVe never talk about things. [ Mrs.
Dashwood ] Hush, please.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.730
That is enough,
Margaret.

35:02.809 --> 35:07.360
If you cannot think of anything appropriate to say,
you will please restrict your remarks to the weather.

35:10.483 --> 35:13.908
Surely they've got enough reeds
for a Moses basket by now.

35:13.987 --> 35:16.115

Mama! We've got lots!

35:18.908 --> 35:22.128
Wrap your string around this.
Good and tight.

35:22.203 --> 35:24.581
[ Margaret]
I know tight.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.881
[ Sighs ]

35:52.567 --> 35:55.446
[ Sir John ] You know what
they're saying, of course.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.451
Hmm?

35:57.530 --> 36:01.205
V\/ord is, you've developed a
taste for certain company.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.207
And why not, say I?

36:03.286 --> 36:05.709
A man like you
in his prime?

36:05.789 --> 36:08.212
She'd be a very fortunate
younglady.

36:08.291 --> 36:12.216
Marianne Dashwood would no more think
of me than she would of you, John.

36:12.295 --> 36:15.219
Brandon, my boy, do not think
of yourself so meanly.

36:15.298 --> 36:17.767
And all the better for her.

36:33.441 --> 36:35.443
[ Brandon ] Very good.

36:48.123 --> 36:50.046
An excellent match.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.298
For he's rich
and she's handsome.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.721
How long have you
known the colonel?

36:54.796 --> 36:57.970
Oh, Lord bless you, as long
as ever l've been here,

36:58.049 --> 37:00.472
and I came
15 years back.

37:00.552 --> 37:05.479
His estate at Delaford is but four miles
hence, and he and John are very thick.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.731
He has no wife and children,
for he-

37:08.810 --> 37:10.733
he had a tragic history.

37:10.812 --> 37:14.737
He loved a girl once,
2O years ago now.

37:14.816 --> 37:17.865
A ward to his family.
But they were not permitted to marry.

37:17.944 --> 37:21.494
- On what grounds?
- Money. Eliza was poor.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.826
When the father
discovered their <i>amour,</i>

37:23.908 --> 37:27.253
she was flung out of the house and
he was packed up into the army.

37:27.328 --> 37:30.298
I think he would've
done himself a harm if not for John.

37:31.416 --> 37:34.386
What became of the lady?
[ Sighs ]

37:34.461 --> 37:37.385
She was passed from man to man.
[ Casper Barks ]

37:37.464 --> 37:39.683
Disappeared from all good society.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.682
[ Laughing ] When Brandon
came back from India,

37:42.761 --> 37:44.855
he searched
heaven knows how long,

37:44.929 --> 37:48.274
only to find her dying
in a poorhouse.

37:48.349 --> 37:51.899
Once I thought my daughter
Charlotte might've cheered him up.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.731
But she's better off where she is.
[ Chuckles ]

37:54.814 --> 37:57.533
But look at him now.

37:57.609 --> 38:01.079
So attentive.
[ Chuckling ]

38:01.154 --> 38:04.704
[Sir John ] VVell done! I think I
shall try a little experiment on him.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.787
Oh, no. Mrs. Jennings,
please leave the poor colonel alone.

38:07.869 --> 38:11.749
No, no, my dear. lt'sjust the thing.
All suitors need a little help.

38:11.831 --> 38:13.754
[Laughs]
Colonel Brandon!

38:13.833 --> 38:16.757
We have not heard you
play for us of late.

38:16.836 --> 38:20.136
There's a simple reason, that you
have a far superior musician here.

38:20.215 --> 38:24.470
Perhaps you did not know, Miss Marianne, that
our dear Brandon shares your passion for music.

38:24.552 --> 38:27.726
He plays a pianoforte
very well.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.729
Oh, come.

38:29.808 --> 38:34.609
I trow you know as many melancholy
tunes as Miss Marianne.

38:34.687 --> 38:36.610
You must play us a duet!

38:36.689 --> 38:40.239
Let us see you both
side by side.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.821
I do not know any duets.

38:42.904 --> 38:44.872
Forgive me, Colonel.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.164
[ Mrs. Jennings Chuckles]

38:50.245 --> 38:53.715
Oh, are we never
to have a moment's peace?

38:53.790 --> 38:57.010
The rent here may be low, but I believe
we have it on very hard terms.

38:57.085 --> 39:00.009
Mrs. Jennings is a wealthy
woman with a married daughter.

39:00.088 --> 39:03.012
She has nothing to do
but marry off everyone else's.

39:03.091 --> 39:05.435
There's a parcel arrived for you, Mrs.
Dashwood.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.433
[ Elinor] A parcel? Ch, lOOk!

39:07.512 --> 39:10.436
V\/hen did it arrive? While
you were up at the Park.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.859
Can I open it?
It is too ridiculous.

39:12.934 --> 39:16.689
V\/hen is a man to be safe from such wit,
if age and infirmity do not protect him?

39:16.771 --> 39:19.866
- Infirmity? - If Colonel Brandon is
infirm, then I am at death's door.

39:19.941 --> 39:22.319
It is a miracle your life
has extended this far.

39:22.402 --> 39:24.871
Did you not hear him complain
of a rheumatism in his shoulder?

39:24.946 --> 39:27.540
[ Elinor] “A slight ache”
I believe was his phrase.

39:32.579 --> 39:36.459
But Edward said
he would bring it himself.

39:38.710 --> 39:42.556
“Dear Mrs. Dashwood, Miss Dashwood,
Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret,

39:42.630 --> 39:46.351
it gives me great pleasure to restore
this atlas to its rightful owner.

39:46.426 --> 39:49.896
Alas, business in London does
not permit me to accompany it,

39:49.971 --> 39:52.895
although this is likely to hurt
me far more than it hurts you.

39:52.974 --> 39:56.399
For the present my memories of your
kindness must be enough to sustain me...

39:56.477 --> 40:00.607

servant always, E.C. Ferrars.”

40:01.608 --> 40:03.781

He says he's busy,

VVhy hasn't he come?

40:08.865 --> 40:12.165
[ Marianne ] l'm taking you for a walk.
No, l've been a walk.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.291
You need another.
lt's going to rain.

40:14.370 --> 40:18.466
It is not going to rain. You always
say that and then it always does.

40:19.667 --> 40:22.637
I fear Mrs. Jennings
is a bad influence.

40:30.011 --> 40:31.979
You must miss him,
Elinor.

40:33.306 --> 40:35.274
We are not engaged,

40:37.018 --> 40:40.522
But he loves you, dearest.
Of that I am certain.

40:40.605 --> 40:43.404
I am, by no means, assured of
his regard for me. Oh, Elinor-

40:43.483 --> 40:45.531
But even were he to feel
such a preference,

40:45.610 --> 40:49.535
I think we should be foolish to assume
that there would not be many obstacles...

40:49.614 --> 40:54.040
to his marrying a- a woman of no
rank who cannot afford to buy sugar.

40:54.118 --> 40:56.541
But, Elinor,
your heart must tell you-

40:56.621 --> 41:00.046
In such a situation, Mama, it is
perhaps better to use one's head.

41:08.716 --> 41:10.639
This can't be
good for me.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.642
It's very good for you.
Stop complaining.

is not' giving you a cough.

Now, can you put your arm
about my neck?

43:04.749 --> 43:06.672
[ Panting Continues,

43:08.336 --> 43:10.759
Allow me
to escort you home.

down and he's carrying her!

43:21.766 --> 43:23.268

[ Panting ]

43:24.644 --> 43:27.614
Marianne, are you all right? [ Mrs.
Dashwood ] Oh, my darling.

43:27.688 --> 43:29.611
[ Man ]
lt's a twisted ankle.

43:29.690 --> 43:32.614
Do not be alarmed, Mama. I can
assure you it's not serious.

43:32.693 --> 43:35.788
I took the liberty of feeling the
bone and it's perfectly sound.

43:35.863 --> 43:38.787
Sir, I cannot even begin to thank you.
Please do not think of it.

43:38.866 --> 43:41.085
I am honored
to be of service.

43:41.160 --> 43:45.461
- V\/ill you not be seated? - Excuse me,
I have no desire to leave a watermark.

43:45.540 --> 43:49.465
But permit me to call tomorrow afternoon
and inquire after the patient?

43:49.544 --> 43:51.763
We sh- We shall
look forward to it.

43:51.838 --> 43:54.682
You're most kind. Thank you.
l'll show you out.

43:56.676 --> 43:59.850
Margaret, give the gentleman his hat.
Thank you.

44:01.472 --> 44:04.646
- [ Whispering ] His name! His name!
- Oh, his name.

44:04.725 --> 44:07.695
Please, could you tell us to
whom we are so much obliged?

44:07.770 --> 44:10.740
John VVilloughby of Allenham,
at your service, ma'am.

44:10.815 --> 44:14.194
John Willoughby
of Allenham.

44:16.320 --> 44:18.539
What an impressive gentleman.

44:19.407 --> 44:22.456
He lifted me as if I weighed
no more than a dried leaf.

44:22.535 --> 44:24.663
Is he human?
[ Laughing ]

44:24.745 --> 44:27.168
Tell me if I hurt you.

44:27.248 --> 44:29.751
She feels no pain,
Mama.

44:29.834 --> 44:33.930
Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold
compress, please, quickly as you can.

44:34.005 --> 44:37.430
Oh, please don't say anything important.
Go on, go on.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.306
Betsy!
Did you see him?

44:39.385 --> 44:40.978
He expressed himself well,
did he not?

44:41.053 --> 44:44.307
VVith great decorum and honor.
And spirit and wit and feeling.

44:44.390 --> 44:47.485
- And economy. Ten words at most.
- [ Margaret] VVait for me!

44:47.560 --> 44:50.939
- And he is to come tomorrow. - Marianne,
you must change. You will catch a cold.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.275
What care I for colds
when there is such a man?

44:53.357 --> 44:55.530
You will care very much
when your nose swells up.

44:55.610 --> 44:57.612
You are right.
Help me, Elinor.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.197
[ Groans ]

45:00.615 --> 45:03.368
[ Sir John ] Mr. VVilloughby's well
worth catching, Miss Dashwood.

45:03.451 --> 45:06.876
Miss Marianne must not expect
to have all the men to herself.

45:06.954 --> 45:10.925
- But what do you know of Mr.
Vvilloughby, Sir John? - Decent shot.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.800
- And there's not a bolder rider in
all England. - But what is he like?

45:14.879 --> 45:18.725
- “Like”? - What are his tastes,
his passions, his pursuits?

45:20.218 --> 45:22.141
Well,

45:22.220 --> 45:25.724
he has the smartest
little bitch of a pointer.

45:25.806 --> 45:29.356
- V\/as she out with him yesterday?
- Where is Allenham, Sir John?

45:29.435 --> 45:31.984
Allenham? Nice little
estate three miles east.

45:32.063 --> 45:35.067
He's to inherit it
from an elderly relative.

45:35.149 --> 45:38.119
Lady Allen's the name.
[ Dogs Barking ]

45:43.449 --> 45:47.704
It's Colonel Brandon. I shall
go outside and keep watch.

45:48.788 --> 45:50.586
Hello, Colonel!

45:50.665 --> 45:53.919
You're all on the lookout for
VVilloughby, eh? Dear me, poor Brandon.

45:54.001 --> 45:56.424
You will none of you
think of him now?

45:56.504 --> 45:58.427
[ Elinor]
Come in.

45:59.674 --> 46:02.644
[ Mrs. Dashwood ] Colonel. [ Sir
John ] Good morning, Brandon.

46:02.718 --> 46:06.313
Good morning.
How's the invalid?

46:06.389 --> 46:08.767
Oh, thank you so much,
Colonel.

46:08.849 --> 46:11.227
Uh, Elinor, would
you- Miss Marianne,

46:11.310 --> 46:13.904
I cannot think why you should
set your cap atvvmoughbyu.

46:13.980 --> 46:17.154
When you've already made
such a splendid conquest.

46:17.233 --> 46:20.533
I have no intention of setting
my cap at anyone, Sir John.

46:20.611 --> 46:23.114
Mr. Willoughby,
Lady Allen's nephew?

46:23.197 --> 46:25.620
Aye, he visits every year,
for he's to inherit.

46:25.700 --> 46:31.127
Um, and he has a very pretty estate
of his own, you know, Miss Dashwood.

46:31.205 --> 46:33.958
Combe Magna in Somerset.

46:34.041 --> 46:38.296
Aye, if I were you I would not
give him up to a younger sister...

46:38.379 --> 46:40.473
for all this
tumbling downhill.

46:40.548 --> 46:42.721
- [ Margaret ] Marianne's preserver!
- Don't run.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.098
Ah, ah, the man himself.

46:45.177 --> 46:50.604
Come, Brandon. Vve know when we are not
wanted. Let us leave him to the ladies.

46:50.683 --> 46:52.981
Thank you so much
for calling.

46:55.271 --> 46:58.696
Marianne, the colonel
and Sir John are leaving.

46:58.774 --> 47:01.903
Good-bye, Sir John. Colonel,
thank you for the flowers.

[ Dogs Barking ]

[ Sir John Muttering,
indistinct ]

47:13.289 --> 47:17.214
How do you do, Colonel? How does he do?
How do you do, more like.

47:17.293 --> 47:20.217
Go on in.
They're waiting for you.

47:20.296 --> 47:22.219
Come on, Briar!

47:22.298 --> 47:24.221
Come on.

47:24.300 --> 47:26.268
[Sir John Shouting ]

47:28.429 --> 47:31.148
[ Elinor] Good day, Mr. V\/illoughby.
[ Chuckles ]

Stop it.

47:33.225 --> 47:35.603
Stop it.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.610
Mr. Willoughby.

47:38.689 --> 47:41.989
What a pleasure
to see you again.

47:42.068 --> 47:43.741
The pleasure is all mine,
I can assure you.

47:43.819 --> 47:45.537
I trust Miss Marianne
has not caught cold?

47:45.613 --> 47:48.537
You found out my name.
But of course.

47:48.616 --> 47:51.540
- The neighborhood is crawling
with my spies. - [ Women Chuckle ]

47:51.619 --> 47:54.498
And since you cannot
venture out to nature,

47:54.580 --> 47:57.003
nature must be
brought to you.

47:57.083 --> 48:00.883
Oh, how beautiful.
These are not from the hothouse.

48:02.129 --> 48:05.053
Ah, I see mine is not
the first offering,

48:05.132 --> 48:07.055
nor the most elegant.

48:07.134 --> 48:09.683
I obtained those
from an obliging field.

48:09.762 --> 48:11.685
L've always preferred wildflowers.

48:11.764 --> 48:13.892
I suspected as much.

48:13.974 --> 48:16.443
Elinor, would you put these in
water, please? Oh, yes. Excuse me.

48:16.519 --> 48:19.443
Our gratitude is beyond expression.
But it is I who am grateful.

48:19.522 --> 48:23.527
L've often passed this cottage and
grieved for its lonely state.

48:23.609 --> 48:27.079
Then the first news I had from Lady Allen
when I arrived was that it was taken.

48:27.154 --> 48:30.579
I felt a peculiar interest in the event
which nothing can account for...

48:30.658 --> 48:33.502
but my present delight in meeting you.
[Whispering ]

48:33.577 --> 48:35.545
Pray, sit down, Mr. VVilloughby.
Thank you.

48:35.621 --> 48:38.249
Ah, who is reading
Shakespeare's sonnets?

Oh- VVithout a
doubt, mine is 116.

48:49.718 --> 48:53.768
Let me not to the marriage of
true minds admit impediments.

or bends with the remover to remove.

mark- It is an ever-fixed mark-

49:07.111 --> 49:09.455
- that looks on storms- -
that looks on tempests- Oh!

49:09.530 --> 49:12.625
- L-ls it “tempests”?
- I do believe it is “tempests.”

49:12.700 --> 49:14.794
Let me find it.
[Whispers ]

49:14.869 --> 49:18.464
It's strange you should be reading these,
for look, I carry them with me always.

[ Gasps ]
Oh, how beautiful.

49:30.134 --> 49:32.057
Until tomorrow then.

49:36.348 --> 49:38.942
And my pocket sonnets
are yours, Miss Marianne,

49:39.018 --> 49:41.646

against further injury.

49:41.729 --> 49:44.733

Thank you.

49:49.987 --> 49:52.911
Good work, Marianne.

49:52.990 --> 49:55.914
You've covered Shakespeare,
Scott, all forms of poetry.

49:55.993 --> 49:59.418
Another meeting will ascertain his views
on nature and romantic attachments.

49:59.497 --> 50:03.422
Then you will have nothing left to talk
about and the relationship will be over.

50:03.501 --> 50:05.469
I suppose I have erred
against decorum.

50:05.544 --> 50:09.924
I should've been dull and spiritless and talked
only of the weather or the state of the roads.

50:10.007 --> 50:13.932
No, but Mr. VVilloughby can be in no
doubt of your enthusiasm for him.

50:14.011 --> 50:17.436
VVhy should he doubt it? VVhy
should I hide my regard?

50:17.515 --> 50:20.940
No particular reason. Only
that we know so little of him.

50:21.018 --> 50:23.441
Time alone does not
determine intimacy.

50:23.521 --> 50:26.946
Seven years would be insufficient to make
some people acquainted with each other,

50:27.024 --> 50:30.949
and seven days can be more than enough for
others. Or seven hours, in this case.

50:31.028 --> 50:33.451
I feel I know
Mr. Willoughby already.

50:33.531 --> 50:35.454
If I had more
shallow feelings,

50:35.533 --> 50:38.958
I could, perhaps, conceal them as you do.
Marianne, that is not fair.

50:39.036 --> 50:42.461
L'm sorry, Elinor. I did not mean-
Do not trouble yourself, Marianne.

There is nothing under 1O pence a

51:47.730 --> 51:50.654

they'll be married before long.

If there was any true impropriety in my
behavior, I should be sensible of it, Elinor.

52:40.199 --> 52:44.124
But it has already exposed you to
some very impertinent remarks.

52:44.203 --> 52:46.422
Do you not begin to doubt
your own discretion?

52:47.539 --> 52:50.964
If the impertinent remarks of such as Mrs.
Jennings are proof of impropriety,

moment of our lives. [ Murmuring ]

Yes.

54:17.463 --> 54:20.387
Marianne does not approve
of hiding her emotions.

54:21.675 --> 54:23.598
In fact,
her romantic prejudices...

54:23.677 --> 54:26.772

to set propriety at naught.

54:26.847 --> 54:29.566
She is wholly unspoilt.

54:29.641 --> 54:32.235
Rather too unspoilt
in my view.

54:32.311 --> 54:36.236
The sooner she becomes acquainted with
the ways of the world, the better.

54:41.195 --> 54:44.119
I knew a lady very like your sister-

54:44.198 --> 54:47.122

better acquaintance with the world.

ruination and despair.

55:15.479 --> 55:17.402
Imagine my surprise,
Mrs. Dashwood,

55:17.481 --> 55:20.655
when Charlotte and her lord and
master appeared with our cousin Lucy.

55:20.734 --> 55:23.704
The last person
I expected to see!

55:23.779 --> 55:25.907
She probably came
to join in the fun,

55:25.989 --> 55:29.414

luxuries at home, poor thing.

L'd not seen you for so long, dear Mrs.
Jennings, I couldn't resist the opportunity.

You sly thing! It was the Misses Dashwood
she wanted to see, not Delaford, Mama.

I have heard nothing but “Miss
Dashwood this, Miss Dashwood that”...

55:40.295 --> 55:42.013

55:42.089 --> 55:44.683
And what do you think of them
now you do see them, Lucy?

55:44.758 --> 55:48.604

her letters since you came to Barton.

It is very fatiguing for him for he
is forced to make everybody like him.

56:00.858 --> 56:03.862
He says it is quite shocking. I
never said anything so irrational.

56:03.944 --> 56:06.663
[ Mrs. Jennings ] Oh, Mr.
Palmer's so droll.

56:06.738 --> 56:08.661
He's always out of humor.

56:08.740 --> 56:10.458
Oh! Here he comes.

56:10.534 --> 56:13.458
Now you shall see, Charlotte.
[ Dogs Barking ]

56:17.457 --> 56:19.710
VVhoa.VVhoa.

56:19.793 --> 56:22.342
Hello,
Mr. Willoughby!

56:22.421 --> 56:26.051
Come, you must meet my daughter Charlotte.
Mr. Palmer.

56:26.133 --> 56:30.479
- How do you do?
- And our little cousin, Miss Lucy Steele.

56:30.554 --> 56:32.977
Welcome to our party,
Miss Steele.

56:33.056 --> 56:35.229
Turn about. Come 'round, boys.
Come 'round.

56:35.309 --> 56:39.439
[ Mrs. Jennings ] I know Mr.
VVilloughby extremely well.

56:39.521 --> 56:42.866
May I beg a seat beside you,
Miss Dashwood?

56:42.941 --> 56:45.069
L've so longed to make
your better acquaintance.

56:45.152 --> 56:49.658
- L've heard nothing but the highest
praise of you. - I would be delighted.

56:49.740 --> 56:53.165
But Sir John and Mrs. Jennings are
too excessive in their compliments.

56:53.243 --> 56:55.086
Oh, no.
I am sure to disappoint.

56:55.162 --> 56:58.086
No, for it was from quite
another source I heard you praised,

56:58.165 --> 57:00.884
and one not at all inclined
to exaggeration.

57:00.959 --> 57:03.007
[ Charlotte Giggling ] [ Sir
John ] VVhat can this be?

57:08.675 --> 57:11.349
[ Dogs Barking ]

57:14.097 --> 57:16.270
Is Colonel Brandon here?
Over here!

57:16.350 --> 57:18.023
Where is he?
There he is!

57:26.026 --> 57:28.529
My horse. Quickly!

57:28.612 --> 57:31.616
- What's the matter, Brandon?
- I must away to London.

57:31.698 --> 57:34.542
- No! Impossible!
- Imperative!

57:34.618 --> 57:37.417
But w-we're all assembled!
Hlsend for my things later.

57:37.496 --> 57:40.420
VVe cannot picnic at Delaford without
our host. Go up to town tomorrow.

57:40.499 --> 57:43.469
Or wait until we return and start then.
You'd not be six hours later.

57:43.543 --> 57:46.592
[ Horse VVhinnies] I cannot
afford to lose one minute.

57:46.672 --> 57:48.595
Forgive me.

57:48.674 --> 57:52.269
I hope it's nothing serious, Colonel.
[ Hoofbeats ]

57:52.344 --> 57:56.315
[Sir John] Upon my soul, this is all
very unusual! [ Guests Chattering ]

57:58.850 --> 58:01.854
Frailty, thy name is Brandon.

58:02.479 --> 58:05.153
[ Marianne ] There are some people
who can't bear a party of pleasure.

58:05.232 --> 58:09.738
You're a very wicked pair. Colonel
Brandon will be sadly missed.

58:09.820 --> 58:14.451
V\/hy? When he is the sort of man
that everyone speaks well of...

58:14.533 --> 58:16.956
and no one remembers to talk to.
[ Marianne ] Exactly.

58:17.035 --> 58:20.380
[ Mrs. Dashwood ] Nonsense. Colonel Brandon
is very highly respected at Barton Park.

58:20.455 --> 58:22.674
Hmph. Which is enough
censure in itself, hmm?

58:22.749 --> 58:24.877
Really, Willoughby.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.884
[ Imitating Mrs. Jennings ]
Come, come, Mr. lmpudence.

58:27.963 --> 58:30.887
I know you and your wicked ways.
Oh! [Giggling ]

58:30.966 --> 58:33.890
Come, Miss Dashwood. Reveal your beau.
Reveal him, I say.

58:33.969 --> 58:36.893
Let's have no secrets between friends.
Let me winkle them out of you.

58:36.972 --> 58:40.192
Hush. I do declare,
Miss Marianne.

58:40.267 --> 58:42.861
If I do not have you married
to the colonel by teatime,

58:42.936 --> 58:45.359
I shall swallow
my own bonnet.

58:45.439 --> 58:47.362
As if you could marry
such a character.

58:48.275 --> 58:50.323
Why should you dislike him?

58:51.820 --> 58:55.040
Because he has threatened rne
with rain when I wanted it fine.

58:55.115 --> 58:56.867
[ Mrs. Dashwood Chuckles]

58:56.950 --> 58:59.669
He has found fault
with the balance of my high flyer.

58:59.745 --> 59:02.874
And I cannot persuade him
to buy my brown mare. Ch!

59:02.956 --> 59:05.379
If it will be of any satisfaction
to you, however,

59:05.459 --> 59:08.053
to be told that I believe his character
to be, in all other respects...

59:08.128 --> 59:11.553
irreproachable, then l'm ready to
confess it. [ Marianne Squealing ]

59:11.631 --> 59:14.680
And in return for such an acknowledgment
that must give me some pain-

59:14.760 --> 59:17.559
Aaah! you cannot deny
me the privilege...

59:17.637 --> 59:20.561
of disliking him
as much as I adore...

59:25.729 --> 59:27.652
this cottage.

59:29.900 --> 59:32.699
I have great plans for improvements
to it, you know, Mr. Vvilloughby.

59:32.778 --> 59:36.408
Now, that I will
never consent to.

59:36.490 --> 59:38.959
Not a stone must be
added to its walls.

59:40.869 --> 59:43.588
Were I rich enough, I would
instantly pull down Combe Magna...

59:43.663 --> 59:46.132
and rebuild it
in the exact image of this cottage.

59:46.208 --> 59:50.384
V\/ith dark narrow stairs, a poky hall
and a fire that smokes, I suppose.

59:50.462 --> 59:53.011
Especially the fire
that smokes.

59:53.090 --> 59:56.515
For then I should be as happy at
Combe as I have been at Barton.

59:58.345 --> 01:00:01.975
But this place has one claim on my affections
that none other can possibly share.

01:00:04.142 --> 01:00:07.646
[ Sighs ] Promise me
you'll neverchangeit

01:00:12.526 --> 01:00:15.120
l'm honored that so fair
and virtuous a lady...

01:00:15.195 --> 01:00:19.291
should compromise her honor by
seeing me to the gate unaccompanied.

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:22.119
[Laughs] That is exactly
what Elinor would say.

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:25.172
And she would be right.

01:00:25.247 --> 01:00:29.127
Miss Marianne, will you do me the honor
of granting me an interview tomorrow...

01:00:29.209 --> 01:00:30.677
alone?

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:33.301
Oh, Willoughby,
we're always alone.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.633
But there is-

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:38.468
There's something very particular
I should like to ask you.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:43.057
Of course.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:46.360
I shall ask Mama
if I may stay behind from church.

01:00:47.602 --> 01:00:49.570
Thank you.

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:53.192
Until tomorrow, then.

01:00:55.944 --> 01:00:57.912
Miss Marianne.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.592
Oh, virtue.

01:01:10.667 --> 01:01:14.547
Silently and with fear,
enter thou into the hearts...

01:01:14.629 --> 01:01:16.757
of all them
that hear me this day.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.263
Do you think he'll kneel
down when he asks her? Shh!

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:22.937
The fear of him is the beginning of wisdom.
They always kneel down.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:26.108
Good understanding have
all they that do thereafter.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:29.187

what is the matter?

01:01:44.868 --> 01:01:47.337
I must-

01:01:47.412 --> 01:01:51.383
Forgive me, Mrs. Dashwood.
l'm sent-

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:55.884
That is to say, Lady Allen has
exercised the privilege of riches...

01:01:55.962 --> 01:01:59.057
upon a dependent cousin
and is sending me to London.

01:01:59.132 --> 01:02:02.887
- When? This morning?
- Almost this moment.

01:02:02.969 --> 01:02:04.892
What a disappointment.

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:07.895
But your business will not detain
you from us for long, I hope?

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:10.898
You're very kind, but...

01:02:10.977 --> 01:02:15.107
I have no idea of returning
immediately into Devonshire.

L'm seldom invited to Allenham
more than once a year.

01:02:17.984 --> 01:02:21.363
Oh, for shame, VVilloughby. Can you wait
for an invitation from Barton Cottage?

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:26.210
My engagements at present
are of such a n-nature-

01:02:27.619 --> 01:02:31.123
That is to say,
I dare not flatter my-

01:02:31.206 --> 01:02:33.550
It is folly to linger
in this manner.

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:36.048
I will not torment myself further.

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:39.757
[Sobbing Continues]
Willoughby, come back!

01:02:39.839 --> 01:02:44.345

cup of hot tea for Marianne.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:47.556
What is wrong, my love?
Do not ask me questions.

01:02:47.639 --> 01:02:51.143
- [ Margaret ] Betsy!
- Please let me be!

[Sobbing Continues]

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:58.867
[ Door Closes ] They
must have quarreled.

On, that is unlikely.

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.368
Perhaps this Lady Allen...

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:07.371
disapproves of his regard
for Marianne...

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.623
and has invented an excuse
to send him away.

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:12.707
Then why did he not
say as much?

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.633
It is not like Willoughby
to be secretive.

01:03:15.709 --> 01:03:18.428
VVhat is it you suspect him of?
I can hardly tell you.

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:22.224
But why was his manner so guilty?
What are you saying, Elinor?

01:03:22.299 --> 01:03:25.143
That he's been acting a part to
your sister for all this time?

01:03:25.218 --> 01:03:27.220
No. He loves her.
l'm sure.

01:03:27.304 --> 01:03:30.148
Of course he loves her.

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:33.898
Has he left her with any assurance
of his return? [ Margaret] Marianne!

01:03:33.977 --> 01:03:38.323
Cannot you ask her if he has proposed?
Certainly not.

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:42.278
I cannot force a confidence from
Marianne and nor should you.

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.785
V\/e must trust her to confide
in us in her own time.

01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:51.371
There was something so underhand
in the manner of his leaving.

01:03:51.453 --> 01:03:54.548
You are resolved, then, to think the
worst of him? l'm not resolved.

01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:57.171
I prefer to give him the benefit
of my good opinion.

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.469
He deserves no less
from all of us!

01:04:00.295 --> 01:04:03.424

of Willoughby.

There is a particular question
l've long wanted to ask you.

01:05:42.730 --> 01:05:45.859
But perhaps you'll think me impertinent?
I cannot imagine so.

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.865
But it is an odd question.
Oh, forgive me.

01:05:47.944 --> 01:05:50.367
I have no wish to trouble you.
No, my dear Miss Steele.

know he looks on you quite as his own sister.

01:07:55.154 --> 01:07:58.829
L'm sorry.
We- Surely, we-

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:04.749

the same Mr. Ferrars.

Oh, the very same.

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:11.430
He was four years under the tutelage of
my uncle, Mr. Pratt, down in Plymouth.

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:13.802
Has he never spoken
of it?

01:08:13.881 --> 01:08:17.602
Yes.
Yes, I believe he has.

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:24.184
I was very unwilling to enter into it
without his mother's approval.

01:08:24.267 --> 01:08:27.191
But we loved each other
with too great a passion for prudence.

01:08:28.563 --> 01:08:31.442
Though you do not know him
as well as I, Miss Dashwood,

01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:36.826

making a woman sincerely attached to him.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:43.037
I cannot pretend it has not
been very hard on us both.

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:46.589

above twice a year.

Perfectly well. Thank you.
l've not offended you?

01:09:03.221 --> 01:09:06.145
On the contrary. [ Mrs. Jennings]
I cannot stand it any longer.

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:08.102
I must know what
you're saying, Lucy.

01:09:08.185 --> 01:09:12.612
If anyone finds out, it will ruin him.
Promise me you'll not tell a soul.

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:14.738

is quite engrossed.

from us, Miss Lucy. - I give you my word.

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:23.577
V\/ell, and what can have fascinated
you to such an extent, Miss Dashwood?

its diversions.

Do you hear that, Charlotte?
[Panfing]

01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.760
While you were so busy whispering,
Charlotte and I have concocted a plan.

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:37.840
It is the best plan in the world!

You know perfectly well
you're too young, dearest.

I shall convey you all to my house in Chelsea,
and we will taste the delights of the season.

01:09:59.612 --> 01:10:02.365
[ Margaret] Oh, please, can I go?
l'm 12 soon.

01:10:02.448 --> 01:10:06.578
Mr. Palmer, do you not long to have
the Misses Dashwood come to London?

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:09.665
I came into Devonshire
with no other view.

01:10:10.748 --> 01:10:13.046
Mrs. Jennings,
you are very kind,

01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:14.719

leave our mother.

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:17.388
Oh, your mother can
spare you very well!

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:20.216
- [ Mrs. Dashwood ] Of course I can!
- Of course she can!

01:10:20.299 --> 01:10:23.724
I could not be more delighted.
lt is exactly what I would wish.

01:10:23.803 --> 01:10:26.727
[ Mrs. Jennings ] I will brook
no refusal, Miss Dashwood.

01:10:26.806 --> 01:10:29.229
Let us strike hands
on the bargain.

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:33.563
And if I do not have the three
of you married by Michaelmas,

01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:36.024
it will not be my fault.

grateful in all my life...

Oh, Elinor.

01:10:48.745 --> 01:10:52.170
I shall see Willoughby,
and you will see Edward.

01:10:59.338 --> 01:11:03.935
I do not believe you feel as calm
as you look, Elinor. Not even you.

01:11:04.010 --> 01:11:06.980
I will never sleep
tonight.

01:11:07.054 --> 01:11:11.400
V\/hat were you and Miss
Steele talking about so long?

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:13.899
Nothing of significance.

have been used to having Charlotte...

written to Edward, Miss Dashwood.

01:11:43.216 --> 01:11:45.969
And yet I do not know
how much I may see of him.

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:49.022
Secrecy is vital.
He'll never be able to call.

01:11:49.096 --> 01:11:51.645
I should imagine not.

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:53.647
It's so hard.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:56.696
I believe my only comfort has been
the constancy of his affection.

01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:59.570
You're fortunate, over
such a lengthy engagement,

01:11:59.649 --> 01:12:02.243
never to have had any
doubts on that score.

01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:05.117
Oh. I'm of rather
a jealous nature.

01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:09.167
And if he talked more of one
young woman than any other-

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:12.712
But he's never given a
momenfs alarm on that count.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:17.925
Imagine how glad he'll be
to learn that we are friends.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:27.514
There you are, Pigeon. Have you missed me?
Very much, ma'am.

01:12:27.593 --> 01:12:29.687
You always say so,
and I never believe you.

I trust everything's in order.
In good order, ma'am.

they're definitely engaged.

buy her wedding clothes here in town.

has informed me...

expect any, Mrs. Jennings.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:12.103
Yes.

01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:15.812
In a cottage?

01:20:16.520 --> 01:20:18.443
Yes.

01:20:19.648 --> 01:20:22.948
I am excessively fond
of a cottage.

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:28.958
If I had any money to spare,
I should build one myself.

01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:43.677
Mr. Willoughby.

01:20:43.756 --> 01:20:45.929
How do you do,
Miss Dashwood?

01:20:46.008 --> 01:20:48.557

Thank you.

Will you not
shake hands with me?

Vvmoughby,

Why have you not
come to see me?

01:21:33.138 --> 01:21:37.985
V\/ere you not in London? Have
you not received my letters?

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:42.987
Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving the

might be so bold, Mrs. Jennings,

Nor I. Neither of us
have anything to tell.

01:24:05.916 --> 01:24:09.921

because you communicate nothing.

01:24:17.803 --> 01:24:20.898
[ Mrs. Jennings] I wish Lady Charteris
would limit her invitation list.

I do hope he doesn't keep her
waiting much longer, Miss Dashwood.

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:50.761

01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:56.892
What a welcome I had from
Edwards family, Miss Dashwood.

01:24:56.967 --> 01:25:00.892
L'm surprised you never mentioned how
agreeable your sister-in-law is.

01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:03.565
And Mr. Robert-
all so affable.

01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:06.940
It is perhaps fortunate that none
of them knows of your engagement.

01:25:07.019 --> 01:25:08.987
Excuse me.

01:25:17.738 --> 01:25:20.082
“My dear madam,

01:25:20.157 --> 01:25:25.004
l'm quite at a loss to discover in what point
I could be so unfortunate as to offend you.

01:25:25.078 --> 01:25:27.251
My esteem for your family
is very sincere,

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:31.086
but if I have given rise to a belief of
more than I felt or meant to express,

01:25:31.168 --> 01:25:35.093
I shall reproach myself for
not having been more guarded.

01:25:35.172 --> 01:25:38.016

been engaged elsewhere,

01:25:38.091 --> 01:25:41.470

your letters and the lock of hair...

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:44.147

Dearest.

01:25:55.942 --> 01:25:58.570
It is best to know what
his intentions are at once.

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:02.158
Think of what you would have felt if your
engagement had carried on for months and months...

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.208
before he chose
to put an end to it.

01:26:04.284 --> 01:26:06.753
We're not engaged.

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.580
But y-you wrote to him.

01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:11.884
I thought that he must have left you
with some kind of understanding.

01:26:11.958 --> 01:26:15.553
No. He's not so unworthy
as you think him.

01:26:15.629 --> 01:26:19.224
Not so unworthy? Did he
tell you that he loved you?

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:21.893

01:26:21.968 --> 01:26:25.063
No. Never absolutely.

It was every day implied,
but never declared.

Sometimes I thought it had
been, but it never was.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:35.525
He has broken no vow. He has!
He's broken faith with all of us.

01:26:38.276 --> 01:26:40.199
He did.

01:26:40.278 --> 01:26:43.407

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:56.195

Miss Grey has £50,000.
Marianne is virtually penniless.

01:28:00.567 --> 01:28:03.787
She cannot have expected
him to go through with it.

But I feel for Marianne.

01:28:06.031 --> 01:28:09.581

end a spinster, like Elinor.

them to stay with us for a few days.

VVe are, after all, family.
And my father- My love.

with all my head, but...

as their home at Cleveland,

which is but a day
from Barton.

Then permit me to accompany you and take you
straight on from Cleveland to Barton myself.

01:29:09.219 --> 01:29:11.813
I confess that is precisely
what I had hoped for.

01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:14.812
Marianne suffers cruelly.

01:29:16.685 --> 01:29:20.861
V\/hat pains me most is how hard she
tries to justify Mr. VVilloughby.

01:29:20.939 --> 01:29:23.738
But you know
her disposition.

01:29:27.237 --> 01:29:30.867
Perhaps... I-

01:29:30.949 --> 01:29:33.702
Miss Dashwood,
would you allow me...

01:29:33.785 --> 01:29:38.211
to relate some circumstances which nothing
but an earnest desire of being useful-

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:41.385
You have something to tell me
of Mr. Willoughby?

When I quitted Barton last-

01:29:55.974 --> 01:29:58.602
No, I must go further back.

01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:03.065
No doubt-

01:30:03.148 --> 01:30:06.402
No doubt, Mrs. Jennings
has apprised you...

01:30:06.484 --> 01:30:09.738
of certain events in my past.

01:30:09.821 --> 01:30:13.667
The sad outcome of my connection
with a young woman named Eliza.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:20.461
What is not commonly known
is that...

01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:23.923
20 years ago,
before she died,

01:30:24.002 --> 01:30:27.131
Eliza bore
an illegitimate child.

01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:31.389
The father, whoever he was,
abandoned them.

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:35.430
As Eliza lay dying,

01:30:35.513 --> 01:30:38.767
she begged me
to look after the child.

01:30:38.850 --> 01:30:40.944
I had failed Eliza
in every other way.

01:30:41.019 --> 01:30:44.273
I could not refuse her now.

01:30:44.356 --> 01:30:47.951
I took the child-
Beth is her name-

01:30:48.026 --> 01:30:52.873
and placed her with a family in the country where I
could be sure that she would be well looked after.

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:54.621
I saw her whenever I could.

01:30:54.699 --> 01:30:58.875
And she grew up
so headstrong.

01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:01.753
And God forgive me,
I indulged her.

01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:05.506
I allowed her
too much freedom.

01:31:05.585 --> 01:31:07.963
Almost a year ago,
she disappeared.

01:31:08.046 --> 01:31:10.640
Disappeared?
I instigated a search,

01:31:10.715 --> 01:31:13.764
but for eight months I was
left to imagine the worst.

01:31:13.843 --> 01:31:16.722
At last, on the day
of the Delaford picnic,

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:19.934
I received the first news
ofhen

01:31:21.184 --> 01:31:24.313
She was with child.

01:31:25.689 --> 01:31:31.492
And the blackguard who had left her
with no hint of his whereabouts-

01:31:31.569 --> 01:31:33.867
Oh, good God.

01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:39.498
Do you mean Willoughby?

01:31:43.456 --> 01:31:45.333
Before I could
return to confront him,

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:49.012
Lady Allen had learned of his behavior
and turned him from the house.

01:31:49.087 --> 01:31:53.888
He fled to London. Yes, he left us
that morning without any explanation.

01:31:53.967 --> 01:31:56.311
Lady Allen
had annulled his legacy.

01:31:56.386 --> 01:31:59.731
He was left with next to nothing and
in danger of losing Combe Magna...

01:31:59.806 --> 01:32:02.025
and all the money that
remained to his debtors.

01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:06.488
So he abandoned Marianne...

01:32:06.563 --> 01:32:09.066
for Miss Grey
and her £50,000.

01:32:13.611 --> 01:32:16.285
Is Beth still in town?

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:21.211
She has chosen to return to the
country for her confinement.

01:32:22.412 --> 01:32:24.335
[ Sighs ]

01:32:28.126 --> 01:32:31.050

had I not, from my heart,

01:32:33.131 --> 01:32:35.225
believed it might in time...

as the worst of libertines.

01:32:54.652 --> 01:32:56.905
But I have since learned
from Lady Allen...

01:32:56.988 --> 01:33:00.242
that he did mean to propose
that day, and therefore,

01:33:00.325 --> 01:33:04.580
lcannotdeny that his
intentions towards Marianne...

01:33:04.662 --> 01:33:07.006
were honorable.

01:33:07.082 --> 01:33:09.005
And...

01:33:10.251 --> 01:33:14.722
I feel certain that
he would have married her...

01:33:14.798 --> 01:33:16.721
had it not been-

01:33:16.800 --> 01:33:19.599
For the money.

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:27.940
Dearest, was I right
to tell you?

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:29.942
Of course.

01:33:32.690 --> 01:33:35.284
Whatever his past actions,

01:33:35.360 --> 01:33:37.533
whatever his present course,

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:40.786
at least you may be certain
that he loved you.

01:33:42.492 --> 01:33:44.415
Butnotenough.

01:33:46.037 --> 01:33:47.960
Notenough.

01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:56.639
[ Door Opens ]

01:33:56.714 --> 01:34:00.890
Here is someone to cheer
you up, Miss Dashwood.

01:34:00.969 --> 01:34:02.642
[ Mrs. Jennings
Chuckling ]

01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:08.481
Oh, how is your dear sister,
Miss Dashwood?

01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:10.562
Poor thing.

01:34:10.645 --> 01:34:15.401
I must say, I do not know what I should do
if a man treated me with so little respect.

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:18.453
How are you enjoying your stay
with John and Fanny, Miss Steele?

01:34:18.528 --> 01:34:21.998
Oh, I was never so happy in my
entire life, Miss Dashwood.

01:34:22.073 --> 01:34:25.327
I do believe your sister-in-law
has taken quite a fancy to me.

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:29.415
Oh, I had to come and tell you, for
you cannot imagine what has happened.

01:34:29.497 --> 01:34:34.253
No,lcannoL Yesterday, I was
introduced to Edward's mother.

01:34:35.253 --> 01:34:38.006
And she was a vast deal
more than civil.

01:34:38.089 --> 01:34:40.012
I have not yet seen Edward,

01:34:40.091 --> 01:34:42.059
but I feel sure to very soon.

01:34:42.135 --> 01:34:44.058
[ Knocking ]
Come in.

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:50.777
There's a Mr. Edward Ferrars
to see you, Miss Dashwood.

01:34:52.812 --> 01:34:55.486
Oh.

01:34:55.565 --> 01:34:58.614
Do ask him to come in.

01:35:03.489 --> 01:35:05.457
[ Maid ]
This way, sir.

01:35:23.051 --> 01:35:25.349
Mr. Ferrars.

01:35:25.428 --> 01:35:27.601
Miss Dashwood.

01:35:33.811 --> 01:35:35.813
What a pleasure to see you.

01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:38.696
- Miss Dashwood, how can l- - You
know Miss Steele, of course.

01:35:44.530 --> 01:35:47.909
Indeed. How do you do,
Miss Steele?

01:35:47.992 --> 01:35:50.791
I am well, thank you,
Mr. Ferrars.

01:35:51.996 --> 01:35:54.465
Do sit down.

01:35:57.502 --> 01:36:00.096
Thank you.
[ Swallows ] Yes.

01:36:01.965 --> 01:36:05.060
You must be surprised
to find me here, Mr. Ferrars.

01:36:05.134 --> 01:36:07.887
I expect you thought I was
at your sister's house.

01:36:09.347 --> 01:36:11.270
Let me fetch Marianne.

01:36:11.349 --> 01:36:14.819
- Mr. Ferrars, she would be most disappointed
to miss you. - [ Marianne ] Edward?

01:36:15.895 --> 01:36:18.648
Edward,
I heard your voice.

01:36:19.899 --> 01:36:22.152
At last, you've found us.

01:36:22.235 --> 01:36:25.830
Forgive me, Marianne. My
visit is shamefully overdue.

01:36:25.905 --> 01:36:29.409
You're pale. Y0u've not
been unwell, lhope.

01:36:29.492 --> 01:36:32.962
Do not think of me.
Elinor is well, you see.

01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:35.631
That must be enough
for both of us.

01:36:35.707 --> 01:36:39.211
L-lndeed. And h-how do you
enjoy London, Miss Marianne?

01:36:39.294 --> 01:36:43.140
Not at all. The sight of you is
all the pleasure it has afforded.

01:36:43.214 --> 01:36:45.592
Is that not so, Elinor?

01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:49.933
Why have you not
come to see us before?

01:36:50.013 --> 01:36:52.983
I have been
much engaged elsewhere.

01:36:53.057 --> 01:36:55.526
Engaged elsewhere?

01:36:55.601 --> 01:36:58.024
But what was that when there
were such friends to be met?

01:36:58.104 --> 01:37:01.608
Perhaps, Miss Marianne, you think young men
never honor their engagements, little or great.

01:37:01.691 --> 01:37:07.243
No, indeed. For Edward is the most incapable
of being selfish of anyone I ever saw.

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:13.828
Edward, will you not sit?

01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:16.585
Elinor, help me
to persuade him.

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:28.389
Forgive me. Forgive me.
l-l must take my leave.

01:37:28.468 --> 01:37:29.970
You're only just arrived.

01:37:30.053 --> 01:37:34.433
You would excuse me, but I, um, have an urgent
commission to attend to on Fanny's behalf.

01:37:34.515 --> 01:37:38.736
In that case, perhaps you might escort me
back to your sister's house, Mr. Ferrars.

01:37:41.647 --> 01:37:43.775
It would be an honor.

01:37:46.402 --> 01:37:48.575
Miss Dashwood.

01:37:48.654 --> 01:37:50.622
Marianne.

01:38:04.128 --> 01:38:07.632
Why did you not
urge him to stay?

01:38:07.715 --> 01:38:10.468
He must have had
his reasons for going.

01:38:10.551 --> 01:38:13.225
His reason was, no doubt,
your coldness.

01:38:13.304 --> 01:38:17.229
If I were Edward, I would assume
you did not care for me at all.

01:38:21.145 --> 01:38:24.399
[Lucy] Poor Miss Marianne looked
very badly the other day.

01:38:24.482 --> 01:38:27.861
VVhen I think of her, it frightens me
to think that I shall never marry.

01:38:27.944 --> 01:38:31.619
Nonsense. You will marry far better
than either of the Dashwood girls.

01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:36.244
Oh, but I have no dowry.

01:38:36.327 --> 01:38:39.080
There are qualities which
will always make up for that,

01:38:39.163 --> 01:38:42.087
and you have them
in abundance.

01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:45.386
It would not surprise me if you
were to marry far and away...

01:38:45.461 --> 01:38:47.384
beyond your expectations.

01:38:47.463 --> 01:38:49.886
Oh, I wish that
might be so.

01:38:52.176 --> 01:38:55.430
There is a young man.

01:38:55.513 --> 01:38:58.187
Aha.
l'm glad to hear of it.

01:38:58.266 --> 01:39:00.689
Is he of good fortune
and breeding?

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:02.691
Of both.

01:39:02.770 --> 01:39:06.525
B-But his family would
certainly oppose the match.

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:11.283
Tush. They will allow it as
soon as they see you, my dear.

01:39:11.362 --> 01:39:14.536
It is a very great secret.

01:39:14.615 --> 01:39:18.665
L've told nobody in the world
for fear of discovery.

01:39:19.745 --> 01:39:22.749
I am the soul of discretion.

01:39:23.875 --> 01:39:26.253
If I dared tell-

01:39:27.879 --> 01:39:32.225
I can assure you,
I am as silent as the grave.

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:08.420
Oh, my dears.
What a commotion.

01:40:08.503 --> 01:40:12.849
Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very one I
used to joke you about, Miss Dashwood,

01:40:12.924 --> 01:40:17.100
is engaged these five
years to Lucy Steele.

01:40:17.178 --> 01:40:19.180
Poor Mr. Ferrars.

01:40:19.263 --> 01:40:21.607
His mother, who by all
accounts is very proud,

01:40:21.682 --> 01:40:25.778
has demanded that he break the
engagement on pain of disinheritance.

01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:29.232
But he has refused
to break his promise to Lucy.

01:40:29.315 --> 01:40:33.491
He has stood by her, good man,
and is cut off without a penny.

01:40:33.569 --> 01:40:37.199
She has settled it all
irrevocably on Mr. Robert.

01:40:37.281 --> 01:40:40.660
But I cannot stop.
I must go to Lucy.

01:40:40.743 --> 01:40:44.338
Your sister-in-law scolded her like
any fury, drove her to hysteria.

01:40:45.623 --> 01:40:47.796
How long have you known?

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:50.799
[ Mrs. Jennings] Pigeon, I need
the carriage this instant!

01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:55.384
Since the night Mrs. Jennings
offered to take us to London.

01:40:55.466 --> 01:40:57.844
Why did you not tell me?

01:40:57.927 --> 01:41:01.227
Lucy told me in the
strictest confidence.

01:41:01.305 --> 01:41:03.899
[ Exhales]
I could not break my word.

01:41:03.975 --> 01:41:07.730
- But Edward loves you.
- He made me no promises.

01:41:07.812 --> 01:41:10.816
- He tried to tell me aboutLucy.
- He cannot marry her.

01:41:10.898 --> 01:41:14.573
Would you have him treat her even worse
than Willoughby has treated you?

01:41:14.652 --> 01:41:16.620
N0.

01:41:16.696 --> 01:41:19.290
But nor would I have him
marry where he does not love.

01:41:19.365 --> 01:41:23.415
Edward made his promise a long
time ago, long before he met me.

01:41:23.494 --> 01:41:25.917
Though he may harbor
some r-regret,

01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:30.218
I believe that he will be happy in the knowledge
that he did his duty and kept his word.

01:41:30.293 --> 01:41:32.216
[ Sighs ]
After all-

01:41:32.295 --> 01:41:36.801

intheidea of one's happiness
entirely depending on one person,

01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:42.267
it is not always possible.

01:41:42.346 --> 01:41:44.314
We must accept.

01:41:45.516 --> 01:41:48.360
Edward will marry Lucy.

01:41:48.436 --> 01:41:51.280
And you and I will go home.

Always resignation
and acceptance.

01:41:54.483 --> 01:41:57.578

and honor and duty.

For weeks, Marianne,
l've had this pressing on me...

without being at liberty to speak
of it to a single creature.

01:42:13.002 --> 01:42:18.600
It was forced on me by the very person
whose prior claims ruined all my hopes.

01:42:18.674 --> 01:42:22.679
[ Sighs ] I have endured her
exultation again and again...

01:42:22.762 --> 01:42:25.436
whilst knowing myself
to be divided from Edward forever.

01:42:25.514 --> 01:42:27.937
Believe me, Marianne,
had I not been bound to silence,

01:42:28.017 --> 01:42:31.237
I could have produced proof enough
of a broken heart even for you.

[ Brandon ] I have heard that
owing to his engagement,

01:43:01.092 --> 01:43:05.848
your friend Mr. Ferrars has lost his
fortune irrevocably to his brother.

01:43:05.930 --> 01:43:08.729
Have I been rightly informed?
ls it so?

01:43:08.808 --> 01:43:11.903
It is, indeed, so.

01:43:11.977 --> 01:43:15.072
Are you acquainted
with Mr. Ferrars?

01:43:15.147 --> 01:43:19.698
Uh, no,
we have never met.

01:43:19.777 --> 01:43:22.872
But I know only too well
the cruelty-

01:43:24.323 --> 01:43:27.668
the impolitic cruelty
of dividing two young people...

01:43:27.743 --> 01:43:30.166

01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:37.546
I have a proposal to make that should enable
him to marry Miss Steele immediately.

01:43:39.422 --> 01:43:42.175
Since the gentleman
is so close a friend to your family,

01:43:42.258 --> 01:43:44.431
perhaps you would be good enough
to mention it to him.

01:43:46.721 --> 01:43:48.723
Oh.

delighted to hear it from your own lips.

01:43:54.937 --> 01:43:56.860
I think not.

01:43:58.149 --> 01:44:00.902
His behavior
has proved him proud.

01:44:00.985 --> 01:44:03.909
In the best sense.

01:44:06.615 --> 01:44:09.243
I feel certain
this is the right course.

so promptly to my message.

right to speak, I know.

that understanding you
wish to join the clergy,

he has great pleasure in offering you
the parish on his estate at Delaford...

01:45:33.244 --> 01:45:35.167
Can it be possible?

01:45:36.997 --> 01:45:41.924
