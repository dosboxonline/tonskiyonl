12:28.878 --> 12:31.794
and scans show
a large structure at its center.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.578
So, what else do we know
about the planet?

12:33.622 --> 12:36.799
Uh, it's M-class. Uninhabited.
At least by anyone alive.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.540
The place is kind of like
a burial ground.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.150
Uh, the Promellians used it.

12:40.194 --> 12:42.239
Before they went extinct
themselves, of course.

12:42.283 --> 12:43.632
Why would a Romulan
scientist choose

12:43.675 --> 12:46.809
an ancient Promellian necropolis
as a hiding place?

12:46.853 --> 12:49.812
No idea, sir.
The last recorded exploration

12:49.856 --> 12:52.859
was over a century before
Dr. Vellek was even born.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.599
Any sign of L'ak and Moll?

12:54.643 --> 12:56.165
No, none. But we don't
know the full extent

12:56.210 --> 12:57.733
of their
cloaking capabilities yet.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.517
-Mm, so they could
be down there.
-TILLY: Down there,

12:59.561 --> 13:01.432
up here, either way,
we will keep our eyes peeled.

13:01.476 --> 13:02.782
Which is actually
kind of disgusting

13:02.825 --> 13:04.566
if you think about it.

13:04.609 --> 13:07.264
-[chuckles]
-But I-I'm here
as your science specialist,

13:07.308 --> 13:08.570
so they're peeled.

13:08.613 --> 13:10.267
I'm glad that you are
back with us for this.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.792
Please thank the cadets
for letting us borrow you.

13:12.835 --> 13:16.186
-[chuckles]
-Uh, Lieutenant, I noticed
that our transport coordinates

13:16.230 --> 13:19.276
have us landing quite a distance
from our target location.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.409
Yeah, so, unfortunately,
the entire center area

13:21.452 --> 13:23.759
seems to be surrounded
by a weirdly strong

13:23.803 --> 13:26.675
electromagnetic field.
See?

13:26.718 --> 13:30.113
Something you might see from
a great technological power?

13:30.157 --> 13:32.159
We will find out soon enough.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.421
The field won't allow us
to transport you in,

13:33.464 --> 13:35.118
but we'll get you
as close as we can.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.728
And you'll have to walk
from there.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.774
Have security on standby.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.689
No one goes down unless
they need to be there.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.125
Remind them that
this is a sacred space

13:42.169 --> 13:43.823
and we should tread lightly.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.173
And keep those eyes peeled.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.696
-Aye, Captain.
-Aye, Captain.

13:50.873 --> 13:52.527
Last dance.

13:52.570 --> 13:55.356
I shall follow your lead.

14:02.624 --> 14:04.756
[chuckles softly]

14:08.369 --> 14:10.545
[gasps softly]

14:18.205 --> 14:20.207
It's oddly serene

14:20.250 --> 14:22.600
for a species
that was constantly at war.

14:22.644 --> 14:23.906
Indeed.

14:23.950 --> 14:27.344
I don't believe
I've ever heard such...

14:27.388 --> 14:29.564
quiet.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.308
Wow.

14:37.659 --> 14:40.183
Okay.
Still no life signs?

14:40.227 --> 14:42.925
I have compensated
for the cloaking system

14:42.969 --> 14:44.927
Moll and L'ak had used
against us previously, and...

14:44.971 --> 14:48.800
-Mm.
-...registering none
in the vicinity.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.848
Here.
This large pyramid--

14:52.892 --> 14:54.894
that's where the shadow
would fall.

14:56.504 --> 14:59.333
Power of creation, here we come.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.258
Hey.

15:12.259 --> 15:13.216
Book.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.522
I heard you were on board.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.480
Welcome back.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.310
How are you doing?

15:20.354 --> 15:23.531
Yeah. Um, I've been helping
resettle DMA refugees...

15:23.574 --> 15:25.750
That is what you were doing.

15:25.794 --> 15:28.579
I want to know
how are you doing?

15:30.668 --> 15:33.367
Just trying
to make sense of it all.

15:33.410 --> 15:34.672
Figure out what's next,

15:34.716 --> 15:36.152
-you know?
-Mm-hmm.

15:36.196 --> 15:39.721
So, what have we got
on Moll and L'ak so far?

15:39.764 --> 15:41.679
Well, let's just say
I know more about the spirits

15:41.723 --> 15:45.422
-my abuelaused to pray to
than I do about these two.
-Hmm.

15:45.466 --> 15:48.686
They use hybridized tech from
a variety of different species,

15:48.730 --> 15:50.819
they don't shy away
from physical confrontation,

15:50.862 --> 15:52.952
though they're not violent
just for the sake of it.

15:52.995 --> 15:56.216
Moll is human,
L'ak is a mystery.

15:56.259 --> 15:57.826
That's about it.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.262
We don't even know
where they're from

15:59.306 --> 16:00.785
or if those are even
their real names.

16:00.829 --> 16:02.657
ZORA:
Dr. Culber, I have the footage

16:02.700 --> 16:04.528
of Moll and L'ak you asked for.

16:06.617 --> 16:09.142
BOOK:
Oh, from when they got away.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.411
What is it?

16:17.454 --> 16:18.847
They've got two starships
on their tail--

16:18.890 --> 16:20.762
one has them on a leash--
and they pull this stunt

16:20.805 --> 16:22.807
like they're
going for style points.

16:22.851 --> 16:25.767
Okay. Why?

16:26.594 --> 16:28.465
'Cause they're free.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.773
Having fun together.

16:34.471 --> 16:36.517
In love.

16:37.518 --> 16:40.825
Means a lot to be together,
I would imagine.

16:41.565 --> 16:44.394
We're here for them, Doc,
not me.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.440
And, you see,
that's not just fun.

16:46.483 --> 16:48.659
That's cliff's-edge
kind of stuff.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.748
Okay, so they're thrill-seekers.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.316
-That's helpful.
-Yeah.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.753
What say we give them a cliff?

16:55.797 --> 16:57.712
See if they're willing to jump.

17:05.198 --> 17:08.330
Did you know you have
a nickname? Action Saru.

17:08.375 --> 17:10.333
Ah, yes.

17:10.377 --> 17:11.508
Huh. You've heard it before?

17:11.551 --> 17:14.555
Yeah, I find it quite humorous.

17:15.208 --> 17:17.210
He didn't tell me
he came up with that.

17:17.252 --> 17:20.343
I mean, it's-it's not that
he needed to, it's just that

17:20.387 --> 17:23.215
we were together
for a long time.

17:23.259 --> 17:26.435
I mean, not long by, uh,
by some standards but

17:26.480 --> 17:29.352
-long for me.
-Are you speaking of Mr. Booker?

17:29.396 --> 17:31.267
Uh, yeah, didn't
he give you that nickname?

17:31.311 --> 17:32.790
Uh, no, it was Commander Reno,

17:32.834 --> 17:34.705
shortly after we arrived
in this future.

17:34.749 --> 17:37.534
She heard about my encounter
with Zareh and, apparently,

17:37.578 --> 17:40.233
my ferocity--
the use of my quills--

17:40.276 --> 17:42.539
well, struck a rather
strong chord with her.

17:42.583 --> 17:45.542
Right. Right.

17:46.587 --> 17:49.633
I'm really happy for you, Saru.

17:50.678 --> 17:54.682
You know, I-I remember the day
you came aboard Discovery.

17:54.725 --> 17:57.859
A mutineer, a prisoner.

17:57.902 --> 18:01.558
You seemed
exactly the wrong choice.

18:01.602 --> 18:05.214
And yet you made the most
of the opportunity.

18:05.258 --> 18:08.696
I-I remain deeply impressed

18:08.739 --> 18:12.134
and inspired by all that
you have accomplished.

18:12.178 --> 18:16.312
Oh, Saru, you have always
seen something in me.

18:17.792 --> 18:21.404
Even when others didn't.
Even when I didn't.

18:21.448 --> 18:25.321
And I look at you now,
who you've become.

18:27.628 --> 18:30.109
Probably the bravest soul
I've ever known.

18:32.328 --> 18:34.765
Thank you, Michael.

18:35.418 --> 18:38.595
How the hell
am I gonna find another you?

18:39.292 --> 18:41.511
You do not need another me.

18:41.555 --> 18:44.123
You need a new Number One.

18:44.166 --> 18:48.605
Right. Well, Tilly wants to go
back to the academy after this.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.694
I've got candidates on Discovery
and across Starfleet.

18:50.738 --> 18:54.263
-I...
-If I may offer
a piece of advice.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.091
Sure.

18:56.918 --> 18:59.268
You are a force, Michael.

18:59.312 --> 19:03.142
I believe you would be aided
by one who is as well.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.622
Someone like Mr. Booker,
now that I think of it.

19:05.666 --> 19:08.147
-You're not suggesting
I make Book my Number...
-I simply mean to say

19:08.190 --> 19:10.453
that he stands his ground,

19:10.497 --> 19:12.194
even in difficult moments.

19:12.238 --> 19:15.632
-If you were to...
-Saru.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.469
Bodies wouldn't
be unburied here.

19:26.513 --> 19:28.776
What do you think--
grave robbers?

19:28.819 --> 19:30.734
SARU:
I would venture to say
they have been here

19:30.778 --> 19:33.084
for quite some time.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.174
But not courtesy
of Moll and L'ak.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.220
Which begs the question:
what killed them?

19:43.530 --> 19:46.315
If only the stones could speak.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.101
BURNHAM:
Let's keep our eyes open.

19:50.754 --> 19:52.495
Hate to miss your wedding
because I'm dead.

19:52.539 --> 19:54.758
That would be
a grave disappointment.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.282
Did you just make a pun?

19:56.325 --> 19:57.761
Oh, unintentional.

19:57.805 --> 20:00.503
Unless, of course,
you found it amusing.

20:14.909 --> 20:16.693
What?

20:16.737 --> 20:18.826
Nothing. I'm...

20:18.869 --> 20:20.871
very happy that you're back.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.133
Mm.

20:22.177 --> 20:23.396
Even if it is just temporary.

20:23.439 --> 20:26.268
Thanks.
Mm, um, me, too.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.532
Although I-I do really feel
like I found my place there.

20:29.576 --> 20:30.707
Like, I love teaching.

20:30.751 --> 20:32.796
Yeah, you're
really good at it.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.276
Well...

20:34.320 --> 20:35.538
my cadets haven't really been

20:35.582 --> 20:37.148
rising to the challenge
in the field.

20:37.192 --> 20:38.541
They can task,

20:38.585 --> 20:40.543
but then they never
seem to fully grasp

20:40.587 --> 20:42.893
the meaning
of the mission itself.

20:42.937 --> 20:45.766
Tasks are concrete.

20:45.809 --> 20:48.682
And meaning is...

20:48.725 --> 20:51.162
Hmm.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.903
Well, hopefully some

20:52.947 --> 20:55.645
time away will give me
time and space to clear my head

20:55.689 --> 20:58.300
and offer a fresh perspective
to help them.

20:58.344 --> 21:01.608
Fresh perspectives are good.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.262
Hmm?

21:03.305 --> 21:05.438
Uh, Gray.

21:06.787 --> 21:09.485
I love him a lot.

21:09.529 --> 21:13.272
And this is the first time
that it's just been me.

21:13.924 --> 21:15.361
And I...

21:16.449 --> 21:18.668
I don't know,
I kind of like it.

21:19.321 --> 21:22.281
And you don't know
how to feel about that?

21:24.805 --> 21:26.807
[alert beeping]

21:26.850 --> 21:28.896
Huh, that's odd.

21:28.939 --> 21:30.506
Uh, that's, uh...

21:30.550 --> 21:32.726
there's a spike
in the electromagnetic field.

21:36.730 --> 21:40.255
Getting close.
500 meters from the target.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.431
Still no sign of Moll and L'ak.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.375
TILLY [on comms]:
Captain, we've been
looking at the spikes

22:13.419 --> 22:15.377
in the electromagnetic field.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.813
Are you seeing
anything weird down there?

22:16.857 --> 22:18.467
No.

22:18.511 --> 22:19.816
Nothing weird.

22:19.860 --> 22:21.383
[rumbling]

22:30.610 --> 22:32.525
Changed my mind.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.313
[gasps]

22:42.796 --> 22:45.494
[grunting]

22:46.582 --> 22:49.716
Looks like we know
what killed the grave robbers.

22:59.856 --> 23:03.643
Incredible that, although fallen
and shattered centuries ago,

23:03.686 --> 23:06.385
the technology of this
security system has endured.

23:06.428 --> 23:08.343
I'm sure I'll appreciate that
at some point.

23:08.952 --> 23:10.389
Discovery,with transporters
out, if we run,

23:10.432 --> 23:11.694
these drones'll
cut us to pieces.

23:11.738 --> 23:13.566
We're recalibrating
the transporter system

23:13.609 --> 23:15.394
to get around
the electromagnetic field.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.091
I-I can't-- I can't get it.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.136
TILLY: Captain, can you
make it back to the drop zone

23:19.180 --> 23:21.095
-where we beamed you in?
-Not a chance.

23:21.138 --> 23:22.444
Can you take them out
from orbit?

23:22.488 --> 23:24.228
ADIRA:
No, Captain, you're too close.

23:24.272 --> 23:25.578
Uh, what if we
send in the security team?

23:25.621 --> 23:27.362
I do not believe we will
survive that long, Ensign.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.581
[beeping, whirring]

23:35.370 --> 23:36.893
BURNHAM:
That drone just detonated.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.417
-[drone fires]
-[grunts]

23:40.244 --> 23:43.247
Great. Lose one drone,
another comes.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.510
Tilly, we're losing our foot.

23:44.553 --> 23:46.337
What...
Oh, my God, who lost a foot?

23:46.381 --> 23:48.383
No, not our actual feet.
The foot we're hiding under.

23:48.427 --> 23:50.211
But we'll lose our actual heads
if we can't find

23:50.254 --> 23:52.518
-the power source
and shut this thing down.
-TILLY: On it.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.607
We remain in your capable
hands, Lieutenant.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.522
-Capable and speedy.
-TILLY: Okay.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.480
Power sources--
let's run through them.

23:58.524 --> 24:01.527
-Ion reactor?
-Not that I can see.
Uh, uh, deuterium?

24:01.570 --> 24:04.138
No, no spectral traces. What...
Uh, it's got to be run

24:04.181 --> 24:06.096
on some sort of battery
of some kind, right?

24:06.140 --> 24:07.750
Well, what about
cloaked antimatter?

24:07.794 --> 24:09.622
COMMS OFFICER:
Excuse me, Lieutenant,
you're receiving

24:09.665 --> 24:11.275
an urgent transmission
from Federation headquarters.

24:11.319 --> 24:12.755
I'm sorry,
that's gonna have to wait.

24:12.799 --> 24:14.801
I hate waiting, and sounds
like you could use my help.

24:14.844 --> 24:16.237
Captain Rayner?

24:16.280 --> 24:17.499
I've been monitoring

24:17.543 --> 24:18.544
But how...?

24:18.587 --> 24:20.502
30 years at Starfleet,
that's how.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.199
This is your first
Red Directive?

24:22.243 --> 24:23.984
I've been on seven,
served point on four.

24:24.027 --> 24:27.117
-Now, about that help...
-Okay, this is a science
problem, Captain.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.598
No, this is a people problem,
as you might say. It always is.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.295
Do you really think
the Promellians were using

24:31.339 --> 24:34.211
cloaked antimatter batteries
2,000 years ago?

24:35.386 --> 24:38.128
To beat the system they built,
you've got to think like them,

24:38.172 --> 24:40.609
not 32nd century scientists.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.829
Okay, Zora, using
Federation databases, uh,

24:42.872 --> 24:45.179
what energy source did the
Promellians use on their ships?

24:45.222 --> 24:47.137
ZORA:
Lang-cycle fusion
was most common.

24:47.181 --> 24:49.096
Okay, any evidence of that
on the surface when we arrived?

24:49.139 --> 24:51.141
Um...

24:51.968 --> 24:55.537
-Hmm, none.
-BURNHAM: Tilly,
do we have a solve yet?

24:55.581 --> 24:58.018
Uh, working on it.

24:58.061 --> 24:59.715
Don't look at me.
Keep going.

24:59.759 --> 25:01.978
Who were they?
How did they think?

25:02.022 --> 25:03.632
They built a graveyard,

25:03.676 --> 25:05.416
they wanted to protect it
for centuries,

25:05.460 --> 25:06.983
so they needed power.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.855
What technology did they have
available to them?

25:08.898 --> 25:10.378
What could they bring there?
Better yet,

25:10.421 --> 25:11.510
what was already there?

25:11.553 --> 25:13.990
Zora-- or whoever you are--

25:14.034 --> 25:15.644
how'd they power their cities?

25:15.688 --> 25:17.428
What else did they use
for their ships?

25:17.472 --> 25:19.474
ZORA: Data shows
they harnessed gravity waves,

25:19.518 --> 25:21.389
gamma-ray bursts,
electromagnetic waves...

25:21.432 --> 25:23.043
Electromagnetic waves.

Good news: we figured out whats
powering the security system.

25:59.122 --> 26:01.603
Okay.
Sounds like bad news is coming,

26:01.647 --> 26:03.562
but we'll take the good news.
What do we got?

26:03.605 --> 26:05.564
The electromagnetic field--
it spiked before

26:05.607 --> 26:07.870
the security system kicked in.
That's what's powering it.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.611
Well, I fail to see
how that is good news.

26:09.655 --> 26:11.439
We cannot shut down a planet.

26:11.482 --> 26:12.788
No, but if you can locate

26:12.832 --> 26:14.616
the statue's
internal control mechanism,

26:14.660 --> 26:17.401
you could shut that down
and stop the drones.

26:17.445 --> 26:19.969
The head. When the drones
came out of the eyes.

26:20.013 --> 26:21.928
That's where this all started.
We can demolish that.

26:21.971 --> 26:24.539
Whoa. That could cause a chain
reaction throughout the system,

26:24.583 --> 26:25.975
destroying what
we came here to find

26:26.019 --> 26:27.890
and killing us in the process.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.762
Well, it's a risk, but
it's our only option. Discovery

26:29.805 --> 26:32.025
can't get a lock. If we do
nothing, we're dead for sure.

26:32.068 --> 26:33.417
What if we disconnect
the system

26:33.461 --> 26:34.767
from its power source first?

26:34.810 --> 26:36.638
We'll have to scan
the internal mechanism and then

26:36.682 --> 26:38.684
have Tilly analyze how
it connects to the E.M. field.

26:38.727 --> 26:40.511
But the drones are back.

26:40.555 --> 26:41.991
And right now we don't
have that kind of time.

26:42.035 --> 26:43.645
Um, or...

26:43.689 --> 26:45.647
we could use
an electromagnetic pulse.

26:45.691 --> 26:47.475
It disrupts
present-day technology,

26:47.518 --> 26:50.130
it should do the same
with a thousand-year-old system.

26:52.001 --> 26:54.917
Well, Captain...

Tilly, what do you think?

26:58.834 --> 27:00.749
TILLY: Yeah, well, it is
the safer option, Captain.

27:00.793 --> 27:02.664
If you can use the power packs
from your phasers

27:02.708 --> 27:04.797
and set them to emergency
discharge and then get that

was here?

So, maybe the inscription
on the stone is a clue.

It's the next step
to the Progenitors' tech,

destroyed it.

35:04.493 --> 35:06.016
Don't you?

35:06.060 --> 35:08.976
You make a mess
and get Starfleet on your ass,

35:09.019 --> 35:10.891
folks start talking.

35:10.934 --> 35:14.460
[scoffs] Try again.
What is your angle?

35:14.503 --> 35:15.983
I got things that I want, too.

35:16.026 --> 35:17.811
And if I stop you,
I might just get them.

35:17.854 --> 35:20.814
Now, I don't know
if you're running from something

35:20.857 --> 35:23.686
or to something,
but you're running.

35:23.730 --> 35:25.166
All you've got is each other,
and you're in

35:25.210 --> 35:26.689
way over your head.

35:26.733 --> 35:27.995
You need to walk away
before it's too late.

35:28.038 --> 35:30.389
You can't win in a race
with Starfleet.

35:30.432 --> 35:33.000
Wrong.
We're already ahead.

35:33.043 --> 35:35.742
MOLL:
And it's them
who should walk away.

35:35.785 --> 35:39.485
Diary's Romulan.
Federation's got no claim to it.

35:39.528 --> 35:42.401
We saw it first,
finders keepers and all that.

35:42.444 --> 35:45.708
That diary leads to something
more dangerous than you know.

35:45.752 --> 35:49.059
The Federation can handle it,
keep it safe. You can't.

35:49.103 --> 35:51.714
Keep going like this, you'll
end up dead or in the brig.

35:51.758 --> 35:54.935
Or is that the kind of shine
you're looking for?

35:54.978 --> 35:56.676
MOLL:
You know, with
all the Federation kav'kar

35:56.719 --> 35:58.852
coming out of your mouth,
I'm having a hard time

35:58.895 --> 36:02.029
believing you were ever
a courier.

36:02.072 --> 36:03.770
Who are you, really?

36:03.813 --> 36:05.163
No lies here.

36:05.206 --> 36:08.340
I worked in the Beta Quadrant,
mostly sector six.

36:08.383 --> 36:10.733
Name's Cleveland Booker.

36:14.433 --> 36:15.782
You heard of me.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.482
You're right about one thing.

36:21.744 --> 36:23.746
All we have is each other.

36:24.617 --> 36:26.662
And that's more than enough.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.840
CULBER:
Did we get the trace?

36:30.884 --> 36:32.842
STAMETS:
No, they routed
their comms signal through

36:32.886 --> 36:35.062
an unstable wormhole.
Smart

36:35.105 --> 36:37.456
but completely untraceable.

36:39.022 --> 36:41.111
Book?
You all right?

36:41.155 --> 36:43.897
BOOK:
Yeah.

36:45.942 --> 36:47.553
BURNHAM:
So, Dr. Vellek left this clue.

36:47.596 --> 36:48.989
Let's put ourselves
in his shoes.

36:49.032 --> 36:51.644
What do we know about
24th century Romulans?

36:51.687 --> 36:53.167
They were obsessed with secrecy.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.387
Yes, and so the diary,
this place,

36:55.430 --> 36:57.693
uh, the message in a poem...

36:57.737 --> 37:00.130
Maybe it's not just secrecy.
It's security.

37:00.174 --> 37:03.133
Both of which went hand in hand
during the time of the empire.

37:03.177 --> 37:05.962
Uh, eminent Romulan thinkers,
including scientists,

37:06.006 --> 37:08.400
often traveled with...

37:08.443 --> 37:09.662
armed guards.

37:09.705 --> 37:11.838
-TILLY: 60 seconds.
-BURNHAM: Huh.

37:11.881 --> 37:14.493
Their homes also
frequently had a shaiqouin,

37:14.536 --> 37:17.583
a false front door
designed to mislead enemies.

37:17.626 --> 37:19.715
Right, and the entrance
for family and friends

37:19.759 --> 37:21.543
and trusted allies
was in the back.

37:21.587 --> 37:22.805
So, behind the stone.

37:24.503 --> 37:25.939
Or, uh, beneath it?

37:25.982 --> 37:27.462
40 seconds.

37:27.506 --> 37:29.072
Can you muster up that
famous Kelpien strength?

37:29.116 --> 37:31.945
Well... we shall see.

37:33.163 --> 37:35.557
Okay.

37:35.601 --> 37:36.906
-[Saru grunting]
-I see something!

37:36.950 --> 37:38.081
Keep going.

37:38.691 --> 37:41.476
BURNHAM:
Keep going. Keep going!

37:42.260 --> 37:44.610
Got it.
Moll and L'ak don't have

37:44.653 --> 37:46.699
this part of the clue, so
they're on their way to Betazed.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.831
Well, they will realize
their error soon enough

37:48.875 --> 37:50.877
and return here.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.487
BURNHAM:
What is this?

37:53.662 --> 37:54.968
[grunts]

37:56.230 --> 37:57.449
Huh.

37:57.492 --> 37:59.625
SARU:
Oh...

38:00.278 --> 38:01.714
Now, we can't
let them find this.

38:01.757 --> 38:03.933
I do not wish
to destroy the stone, but...

38:03.977 --> 38:06.936
-Ten seconds!
-Okay, well, let's just cover
it up and then leave it be.

38:06.980 --> 38:09.417
This is a sacred space
and we've disturbed it enough.

38:09.461 --> 38:11.637
We'll find another way
to get ahead of Moll and L'ak.

38:11.680 --> 38:12.638
Hurry, hurry.

38:12.681 --> 38:15.162
Five, four...

38:15.205 --> 38:16.511
Captain!

38:16.555 --> 38:18.078
Hurry, hurry, hurry, Saru.

38:18.121 --> 38:19.558
Tilly, now!

38:32.701 --> 38:34.660
[panting]

38:34.703 --> 38:36.531
TILLY:
Exciting last day.

38:36.575 --> 38:38.403
-[chuckles]
-Yeah, indeed.

38:38.446 --> 38:41.057
Yeah, thank you both
very much for your help.

38:41.101 --> 38:42.972
Oh, you should really
be thanking Captain Rayner.

38:43.016 --> 38:44.931
I mean, we-we... we would never
have figured out

38:44.974 --> 38:47.803
-how that security system
worked without him.
-BURNHAM: Rayner?

38:47.847 --> 38:49.936
[exhales]

38:49.979 --> 38:52.678
-Commander Stamets, can you
join us in the science lab?
-STAMETS: On my way.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.810
Any sign
of Moll and L'ak's ship?

38:54.854 --> 38:55.942
None.

38:56.638 --> 38:59.032
Tilly, have Linus
prep a team of DOTs.

38:59.075 --> 39:01.643
There's a stone monument down
there desecrated by phaser fire.

39:01.687 --> 39:03.689
Let's have them repair it
as best as they can.

39:03.732 --> 39:06.039
And let's get sensors
into orbit.

39:06.082 --> 39:07.519
When Moll and L'ak come back,

39:07.562 --> 39:08.824
-I want to know about it.
-[door whooshes open]

39:08.868 --> 39:10.391
-Aye, Cap.
-Aye, Captain.

39:10.435 --> 39:11.523
-[door whooshes shut]
-STAMETS: Oh.

39:11.566 --> 39:14.613
Mr. Saru, I happen
to know a doctor.

39:14.656 --> 39:18.051
Yes, I will see him shortly,
thank you.

39:18.094 --> 39:20.096
Uh, but first-- Captain?

39:21.446 --> 39:23.404
BURNHAM:
Okay, check this out.

39:26.451 --> 39:29.105
Looks similar to the diary
symbol you've been working on,

39:29.149 --> 39:30.672
no?

39:30.716 --> 39:32.152
Yeah, it h-- it has the same

39:32.195 --> 39:35.068
style and visual language.

39:35.111 --> 39:37.636
Zora, can you bring up
the diary symbol?

39:37.679 --> 39:38.941
ZORA:
Yes, Commander.

39:41.596 --> 39:42.902
Zora, can you create
a programmable-matter

39:42.945 --> 39:44.120
version of that?

39:44.164 --> 39:45.992
ZORA:
Of course, Captain.

39:59.658 --> 40:01.573
[gasps]

40:01.616 --> 40:05.446
Yes, Stamets. Yes.

40:09.015 --> 40:10.538
[Stamets gasps softly]

40:11.452 --> 40:13.976
STAMETS:
No wonder we couldn't
find a pattern match.

40:14.020 --> 40:15.717
It was incomplete.

40:15.761 --> 40:17.458
But what is it?

40:23.159 --> 40:26.815
I think this is a map
of some kind,

40:26.859 --> 40:29.165
broken into five pieces.

40:30.036 --> 40:33.953
And the poem
tells us where to go next.

40:33.996 --> 40:37.086
So we just need to find
four more pieces

40:37.130 --> 40:39.001
to complete the map.

40:39.654 --> 40:42.788
TILLY:
So, on-once we have
all five pieces, then we find

40:42.831 --> 40:45.225
what created us?

40:45.268 --> 40:48.489
The Progenitors'
actual technology?

40:48.533 --> 40:50.012
Seems so.

40:54.582 --> 40:56.149
No biggie, then.

40:56.192 --> 40:58.717
Uh, where are we going next?

40:58.760 --> 41:00.588
Uh, the first set of verses

41:00.632 --> 41:02.416
seem to suggest Betazed,

41:02.460 --> 41:04.810
which is where Moll and L'ak
must be heading.

41:04.853 --> 41:07.508
But this final verse reads,

41:07.552 --> 41:09.510
"A world like no other,

41:09.554 --> 41:11.817
"where two souls entwine,

41:11.860 --> 41:13.514
joined as one."

41:13.558 --> 41:16.169
Well, when considered
with the other details--

41:16.212 --> 41:18.693
uh, opaline waters,
shared thoughts...

41:19.389 --> 41:22.001
-...uh, I suppose...
-ADIRA: Trill.

41:23.872 --> 41:26.396
We're going to Trill.

41:27.180 --> 41:29.095
[chuckles]

41:29.138 --> 41:32.098
MOLL:
All we have is each other.

41:32.141 --> 41:35.623
And that's more than enough.

41:35.667 --> 41:37.059
Freeze.

41:38.670 --> 41:41.455
Zora, can you zoom in on Moll?

41:41.499 --> 41:43.152
ZORA:
Certainly, Mr. Booker.

41:45.590 --> 41:49.550
Can you take this image
and age Moll down to...

41:49.594 --> 41:52.510
seven years, three months?

42:15.663 --> 42:16.969
[door chimes]

42:17.012 --> 42:18.448
Come in.

42:21.713 --> 42:24.106
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:24.150 --> 42:26.500
You okay?

42:26.544 --> 42:28.807
The way you left,
it looked like you saw a ghost.

42:28.850 --> 42:30.548
[soft chuckle]

42:32.898 --> 42:34.943
Do you believe in fate?

42:36.728 --> 42:38.991
Depends, I suppose.
Why?

42:40.514 --> 42:42.603
Turns out I know her.

42:42.647 --> 42:44.126
Who?

42:45.867 --> 42:47.869
Moll.

42:49.175 --> 42:50.611
Moll?

42:50.655 --> 42:53.745
Her birthmark. I've only
ever seen it on one person.

42:53.788 --> 42:55.834
Here.

42:55.877 --> 42:57.879
A child.

42:57.923 --> 42:59.620
I'd never
actually met her before.

42:59.664 --> 43:00.839
Until today.

43:00.882 --> 43:03.493
I've only ever seen
a holo image.

43:03.537 --> 43:05.452
Her name is...

43:07.106 --> 43:08.760
...Malinne.

43:11.110 --> 43:14.983
She's the daughter of my mentor
Cleveland Booker IV.

43:15.897 --> 43:17.812
Which, I suppose...

43:18.813 --> 43:22.164
...makes her the closest thing
to family I've got left.

43:45.753 --> 43:48.364
I believe I may be ready.

43:48.408 --> 43:51.106
You can still change your mind.
Okay?

43:51.150 --> 43:53.631
I told Detmer
to pull in real slow.

43:54.501 --> 43:56.329
[soft chuckle]

44:02.509 --> 44:05.468
I passed through

44:05.512 --> 44:07.470
Vahar'ai,

44:07.514 --> 44:10.996
from a life of fear

44:11.039 --> 44:13.172
to a life of hope,

44:13.215 --> 44:15.565
right here in this room.

44:21.006 --> 44:24.096
What I remember most
about that day

44:24.139 --> 44:26.751
is that you were here with me.

44:26.794 --> 44:30.102
You held my hand.

44:30.145 --> 44:32.321
And I was not afraid.

44:34.019 --> 44:36.325
Thank you, Michael.

44:37.413 --> 44:39.372
It was an honor, Saru.

44:41.243 --> 44:43.028
Everything with you has been.

44:45.204 --> 44:47.119
But it's not forever, right?

44:47.162 --> 44:49.469
A few months, hopefully.

44:49.512 --> 44:51.514
Well, while I'm gone,
I do hope that

44:51.558 --> 44:53.516
my replacement
will serve you well.

44:53.560 --> 44:57.042
[chuckles]
There's no replacing you, but...

44:57.085 --> 45:00.045
whoever comes,
I'm sure they'll be great.

45:01.263 --> 45:04.005
Any last words of advice?

45:04.049 --> 45:05.659
Well, I must say, I...

45:05.703 --> 45:07.705
I feel a great deal of power
in this moment.

45:07.748 --> 45:10.142
[both chuckle]

45:10.185 --> 45:12.274
I will simply encourage you

45:12.318 --> 45:15.060
to continue forward as you have.

45:15.103 --> 45:17.976
One cannot predict
what is to come.

45:18.019 --> 45:21.109
But I find that
when I give myself over

45:21.153 --> 45:22.720
to the journey--

45:22.763 --> 45:25.026
trust in the process,

45:25.070 --> 45:27.202
one might say--

45:27.246 --> 45:29.074
there is always

45:29.117 --> 45:31.685
great meaning in that.

45:33.295 --> 45:36.690
Wherever I may
eventually arrive.

45:39.432 --> 45:41.390
I will also advise you

45:41.434 --> 45:45.177
to not touch the swamp kelp
while it is in bloom.

45:45.220 --> 45:47.570
Yes, Tilly warned me.

45:47.614 --> 45:50.225
-[chuckles]
-We'll take good care of them.

45:50.269 --> 45:53.968
And this will always
be here for you.

45:54.795 --> 45:56.275
I know it will.

46:00.061 --> 46:01.715
Thank you, Saru.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.412
For what?

46:04.065 --> 46:06.111
For giving me a second chance.

46:27.393 --> 46:29.569
Brushing up on your geometry?

46:31.049 --> 46:32.528
[chuckles]:
Well...

46:32.572 --> 46:34.269
I actually am.

46:35.140 --> 46:37.142
I... I can't help Charlie

46:37.185 --> 46:39.100
if I don't know
what she's doing.

46:39.144 --> 46:41.233
[chuckles]
Right.

46:41.276 --> 46:44.540
So, I, uh, I read your report.

46:46.542 --> 46:47.979
Good work today.

46:48.022 --> 46:49.589
Thank you, sir.

46:51.504 --> 46:53.636
If I may,

46:53.680 --> 46:56.639
I've been wondering
about the inquiry.

47:02.689 --> 47:04.734
I asked Rayner
to take an early retirement,

47:04.778 --> 47:07.128
effective immediately.

47:09.087 --> 47:10.653
Can't have been easy.

47:10.697 --> 47:13.091
We've been friends for 30 years.

47:14.396 --> 47:17.443
Hopefully still will be
once the dust settles.

47:20.141 --> 47:21.664
I will say...

47:23.710 --> 47:26.365
...on Q'mau...

47:26.408 --> 47:30.021
he did what he thought was right
for the Federation.

47:30.673 --> 47:32.632
He always has.

47:32.675 --> 47:36.679
But the shame is,
he's a damn good captain.

47:36.723 --> 47:39.247
But the world has changed.

47:39.291 --> 47:42.294
I tried to talk to him and...

47:42.337 --> 47:45.123
help him see it, but...

47:45.166 --> 47:47.342
he won't hear me.

48:07.667 --> 48:09.364
You mind?

48:10.409 --> 48:13.412
Free galaxy.
Most of it, anyway.

48:16.023 --> 48:18.721
I got to say...

48:18.765 --> 48:21.115
she's a beautiful ship.

48:23.378 --> 48:25.990
They don't
make 'em like that anymore.

48:26.033 --> 48:27.556
[soft chuckle]

48:29.689 --> 48:31.691
You find the Progenitors' tech?

48:31.734 --> 48:34.955
No, but we found a clue
to where it's hidden.

48:34.999 --> 48:37.697
Next stop: somewhere on Trill.

48:37.740 --> 48:39.699
The quest continues.

48:39.742 --> 48:41.222
Ah.

48:41.266 --> 48:44.182
Thank you for your help today.

48:44.225 --> 48:46.662
Well, I was on break
from getting grilled.

48:46.706 --> 48:48.751
It gave me something to do.

48:49.491 --> 48:51.580
Well, you've done a lot
over the years.

48:53.104 --> 48:55.019
Citations for
distinguished service,

48:55.062 --> 48:57.021
the Grankite Order of Tactics,

48:57.064 --> 48:59.632
-awards of valor.
-Trinkets.

48:59.675 --> 49:02.243
It's what you do in the chair--

49:02.287 --> 49:05.464
every day, every mission--

49:05.507 --> 49:08.206
that's what matters.

49:10.251 --> 49:12.514
You could have told the board
what they wanted to hear.

49:14.647 --> 49:18.085
I know what I stand for,
I know what I believe in.

49:18.129 --> 49:20.958
I'm not gonna
apologize for that.

49:21.001 --> 49:23.003
Anything else, Captain,
or can I go back

49:23.047 --> 49:25.049
to enjoying the view in peace?

49:25.092 --> 49:27.529
So you think you deserved it?

49:27.573 --> 49:28.966
[sighs]

49:29.009 --> 49:30.489
The retirement?

49:33.666 --> 49:37.452
I always tell my crew:

49:37.496 --> 49:39.454
get out of your head,

49:39.498 --> 49:42.153
think like your enemies.

49:43.284 --> 49:45.591
I should have seen it coming.

49:45.634 --> 49:48.115
What Moll and L'ak did on Q'mau.

49:48.159 --> 49:51.466
We've tangled enough.
I should have known. I...

49:53.642 --> 49:55.993
I should have known.

49:56.036 --> 49:59.605
If that town had been hit.

49:59.648 --> 50:01.520
All those lives lost.

50:06.742 --> 50:10.007
Why didn't you say any of that
during the inquiry?

50:10.877 --> 50:12.226
I already dug my own grave
in there.

50:12.270 --> 50:13.488
It wouldn't have mattered.

50:13.532 --> 50:15.621
Doesn't mean
you have to get in it.

50:15.664 --> 50:17.188
[short chuckle]

50:19.103 --> 50:21.757
I want you to be my Number One.

50:24.543 --> 50:27.459
You get knocked in the head
with one of those statues?

50:27.502 --> 50:29.113
[chuckles]

50:29.156 --> 50:30.418
You didn't have to help us
today, but you did

50:30.462 --> 50:32.551
because the mission
matters to you.

50:32.594 --> 50:34.640
Starfleet and the Federation

50:34.683 --> 50:36.511
matter to you.

50:36.555 --> 50:38.426
And I see how you're looking
out at the stars--

50:38.470 --> 50:41.342
we both know
you're not ready to hang it up.

50:42.822 --> 50:45.346
It's an interesting offer.

50:46.608 --> 50:49.698
But Vance wouldn't
let me back on a ship

50:49.742 --> 50:51.352
unless it was a garbage scow.

50:51.396 --> 50:54.225
I already spoke to Vance.
He backs my choice.

50:58.620 --> 51:00.796
I got a second chance once.

51:04.365 --> 51:06.063
This is yours.

51:12.634 --> 51:16.725
We leave for Trill at 0800.
The offer stands till then.

51:18.292 --> 51:20.033
Burnham.

51:26.605 --> 51:29.086
I'm not a yes man.

51:30.130 --> 51:32.306
I'm counting on that.
