02:01.250 --> 02:04.375
Just... you and the one-armed guy?

02:07.958 --> 02:10.624
I herald the arrival
of King Aelstrom of the North Lands.

02:10.625 --> 02:13.040
He has chosen you as his first subject.

02:13.041 --> 02:17.375
Prepare to receive his blessing!

03:02.875 --> 03:04.041
You loons.

03:04.583 --> 03:06.041
This is Aeternum.

03:06.375 --> 03:07.750
Nobody dies, nobody leaves.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.500
He speaks of himself in the third person.

07:18.291 --> 07:20.541
I have lost my king.

07:20.958 --> 07:22.875
What am I supposed to do now?

10:32.541 --> 10:35.541
I need... you... help.

10:35.875 --> 10:37.791
No kidding.

10:38.333 --> 10:43.208
You teach me... to make... forge?

10:43.583 --> 10:46.083
You? It'll take a while.

10:46.458 --> 10:49.416
I have time.
