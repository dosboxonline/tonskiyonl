[birds chirping]

00:46.916 --> 00:48.291
[mouse droid beeping]

00:59.333 --> 01:02.250
[bell chimes]

01:08.250 --> 01:10.125
[bell chimes]

01:10.208 --> 01:11.375
[sighs]

01:17.625 --> 01:20.541
[bell chimes]

01:42.041 --> 01:43.041
Hello.

01:44.583 --> 01:46.125
I'm Omega.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.500
I'm Eva.

01:49.916 --> 01:50.958
What's that?

01:51.458 --> 01:54.333
A game. They want us to play them.

02:05.458 --> 02:06.625
I like your doll.

02:09.083 --> 02:11.041
Dr. Karr gave it to me.

02:12.708 --> 02:14.375
She's the only nice one.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.708
Are they always watching?

02:19.791 --> 02:22.416
Yeah. The droids too.

02:23.041 --> 02:25.416
That's Jax, Sami, and Bayrn.

02:26.458 --> 02:28.041
This is Omega.

02:29.083 --> 02:31.000
How long have you all been here?

02:31.083 --> 02:31.916
[coos]

02:32.000 --> 02:34.666
They don't like it
when we talk to each other so much.

02:35.458 --> 02:38.541
And if you cause problems,
things only get worse.

02:39.375 --> 02:40.375
[sighs]

02:40.458 --> 02:41.541
Come on, Sami.

02:42.750 --> 02:45.708
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.

03:05.875 --> 03:09.791
[sighs] Where in the blasted galaxy
did that pirate abandon us?

03:09.875 --> 03:12.708
And why are you keeping me here?

03:12.791 --> 03:16.708
You'd prefer we take you back
to that Imperial labor camp instead?

03:16.791 --> 03:19.458
[sighs] We had a deal.

03:19.541 --> 03:21.958
I already told you
what I know about Tantiss.

03:22.041 --> 03:27.416
You'll get your freedom when we get
the exact coordinates to that base.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.416
[ship approaching]

03:52.416 --> 03:53.791
Nice work.

03:53.875 --> 03:56.875
A stolen shuttle is the best I could do
on short notice.

03:56.958 --> 03:58.625
The supplies we need are aboard.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.791
You really think we can trust
that hydrosnake?

04:02.875 --> 04:05.250
[Rampart scoffs] I can hear you.

04:05.333 --> 04:09.000
No, but he's our best chance
at finding Omega.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.291
[Wrecker] Now, start talking.

04:18.375 --> 04:21.375
Oh, how many times
do I have to explain it?

04:21.458 --> 04:26.291
Hemlock put safeguards in place
to keep his base's location a secret.

04:26.375 --> 04:28.083
But you've been there before?

04:28.166 --> 04:32.916
Any ship going there must first dock
at Imperial Station 003,

04:33.000 --> 04:34.875
in orbit over Coruscant,

04:34.958 --> 04:38.541
where the coordinates are transmitted
directly to the navicomputer.

04:40.916 --> 04:44.875
Well, his intel about the orbital station
checks out.

04:44.958 --> 04:47.166
But I can't confirm the rest of his story.

04:47.250 --> 04:49.666
[scoffs] Do you think I'm lying?

04:49.750 --> 04:51.000
-Yeah.
-Yes.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.541
Once we reach the station,

04:54.625 --> 04:58.666
we can find a ship departing for Tantiss
and pull the coordinates.

04:58.750 --> 05:01.833
We're going to need
Imperial clearance codes.

05:01.916 --> 05:03.000
Got that covered.

05:03.083 --> 05:06.916
[chuckles] Unlikely.
Those codes change every rotation.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.250
Which is why we're not waiting around.

05:09.333 --> 05:13.333
[chuckles] Even with a stolen shuttle
and clearance codes,

05:13.416 --> 05:18.416
you can't expect to walk onto
an Imperial station completely unnoticed.

05:18.500 --> 05:20.875
But you can.

05:20.958 --> 05:23.875
And we'll be your security detail.

05:23.958 --> 05:26.916
-You just walk us right onto the station.
-[Rampart grunts]

05:27.000 --> 05:28.833
You cannot be serious.

05:28.916 --> 05:33.625
You were an Imperial before.
Impersonating one should be easy enough.

05:33.708 --> 05:36.250
I can't wear this.
It's a captain's uniform.

05:39.666 --> 05:41.250
I was a vice admiral.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.125
Well, you've been demoted.

05:43.750 --> 05:46.333
[sighs] I hate clones.

06:22.166 --> 06:24.625
It's time for your sample, Omega.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.916
[device clicks]

06:28.666 --> 06:32.375
The other kids. Where did they come from?

06:32.458 --> 06:33.833
I don't know.

06:35.625 --> 06:37.208
But they are well looked after here.

06:37.291 --> 06:39.333
I'd like to believe you.

07:32.833 --> 07:37.791
Letting Omega intermingle
with the specimens is unwise.

07:38.541 --> 07:43.041
They're engaging in the activities
I've provided to keep their minds active.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.250
Besides, they are under our watchful eye.

07:47.333 --> 07:50.041
That didn't stop her from causing problems
in the past.

07:50.833 --> 07:52.416
I'm the chief scientist.

07:53.208 --> 07:55.875
I will run the vault as I see fit.

08:17.833 --> 08:20.291
How often do the droids take our vitals?

08:20.916 --> 08:23.166
Twice a day. After meals.

08:23.250 --> 08:26.416
What about the troopers?
Do they ever come in here?

08:26.500 --> 08:28.208
Only when we cause trouble.

08:28.958 --> 08:33.625
Jax tried to escape once,
but he didn't get very far.

08:33.708 --> 08:35.791
There's no way outta here.

08:36.541 --> 08:37.833
[sighs] We're never going home.

08:37.916 --> 08:39.333
[coos]

08:41.458 --> 08:44.166
Want to know a secret?

08:45.958 --> 08:48.000
I escaped from this mountain before.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.083
Really?

08:49.166 --> 08:50.375
[gasps] How?

08:50.458 --> 08:52.083
I had training.

08:52.875 --> 08:54.333
And I wasn't alone.

08:55.250 --> 08:56.416
Know what else?

08:58.000 --> 09:02.458
I'm doing it again,
and I'm taking you all with me.

09:02.541 --> 09:03.625
[coos]

09:04.208 --> 09:05.208
Look.

09:08.750 --> 09:10.250
It's a layout of the vault.

09:12.875 --> 09:17.041
This is where we're sitting right now.
These are the walls.

09:17.625 --> 09:21.541
These are the tubes in the walls
the droids use to transport our samples.

09:22.166 --> 09:24.500
I need to get inside
and see where they go.

09:24.583 --> 09:26.500
Only the droids can access those hatches.

09:29.125 --> 09:31.041
-[Omega] I can get them open.
-[coos]

09:33.791 --> 09:36.916
I just need them not to see me.

09:38.958 --> 09:41.125
Won't take them long
to notice you're missing.

09:41.833 --> 09:44.875
That's okay. I like a challenge.

09:58.166 --> 09:59.625
[Hunter] We're approaching Coruscant.

10:00.291 --> 10:04.458
[Echo] All the armor's been stripped.
But we're still not gonna blend in.

10:04.541 --> 10:06.708
You really think
Rampart can pull this off?

10:06.791 --> 10:10.791
[clears throat, coughs] I beg your pardon.

10:10.875 --> 10:13.875
I didn't just make it to vice admiral
on looks alone.

10:29.250 --> 10:30.250
[console beeps]

10:30.333 --> 10:33.083
[Imperial technician on comm] Rho-class
shuttle, we have you on approach.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.208
Please identify.

10:34.291 --> 10:38.416
[Echo] This is transport shuttle Alpha-44.
Transmitting landing codes.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.416
[console beeping]

10:41.958 --> 10:44.958
[Imperial technician] You're clear
to land at docking bay 5-tac-02.

10:45.041 --> 10:47.000
-[Rampart sighs]
-We can't stay docked for long.

10:47.083 --> 10:49.583
This shuttle's
bound to be reported missing soon.

10:49.666 --> 10:53.500
Assuming we're not captured
or killed during this little mission,

10:53.583 --> 10:56.750
what assurances do I have
that you'll let me go?

10:56.833 --> 11:02.583
You're going to have to trust us.
Just like we have to trust you.

11:02.666 --> 11:04.458
So don't mess this up.

11:04.541 --> 11:09.833
Hmm. Mess this up?
I know how to carry myself.

11:09.916 --> 11:12.666
You're the ones that are gonna stand out
like overheated Gamorreans.

11:41.500 --> 11:46.041
The Empire betrayed and imprisoned you.
We broke you out.

11:46.125 --> 11:48.791
Remember that
before you try and betray us.

11:50.250 --> 11:54.125
I'm here, aren't I?
Let's get this over with.

11:56.666 --> 11:58.958
Wrecker, stay on the ship
and monitor comms.

12:08.208 --> 12:10.666
Who is responsible for this vessel?

12:10.750 --> 12:13.250
It is not on my docking manifest
for today.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.416
[device beeps]

12:17.416 --> 12:21.750
What division are you with?
These uniforms are not regulation.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.958
I asked you a question, trooper.

12:25.041 --> 12:26.208
Step aside.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.083
My division. And my orders are classified.

12:31.833 --> 12:34.916
If you have an issue with that,
Lieutenant,

12:35.000 --> 12:36.875
then contact Governor Tarkin.

12:36.958 --> 12:38.625
Uh, y-yes, sir.

12:38.708 --> 12:40.041
Now, carry on.

12:40.125 --> 12:42.416
Uh, yes. S-Sorry, sir.

12:44.041 --> 12:45.041
[door slides open]

12:46.500 --> 12:48.291
I've missed this.

12:49.041 --> 12:50.125
Shall we?

12:55.541 --> 12:57.416
[droid beeping]

13:07.875 --> 13:08.958
[beeping]

13:11.375 --> 13:12.625
[comms chatter]

13:22.875 --> 13:24.458
[droid whirs]

13:25.333 --> 13:27.166
The control room is up ahead.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.875
We can access the station manifest
from there.

13:29.958 --> 13:34.666
[Echo] Just do your thing
and get us inside. We'll handle the rest.

13:34.750 --> 13:37.041
That's, "Do your thing, sir."

13:37.125 --> 13:38.833
I don't think so.

13:38.916 --> 13:40.791
[comms chatter]

13:41.416 --> 13:44.166
-Troopers, you are relieved.
-Captain?

13:44.250 --> 13:47.291
Report to the barracks.
You'll receive further instructions.

13:47.375 --> 13:49.750
But, sir, we just started our shift.

13:49.833 --> 13:52.500
Perhaps you'd like to spend
a few rotations in the brig

13:52.583 --> 13:55.708
for violating Article 15
of Imperial standing order 10?

13:56.625 --> 13:58.083
No, sir.

14:05.208 --> 14:06.458
Sir?

14:06.541 --> 14:08.875
You, show me the station manifest.

14:08.958 --> 14:11.041
I will need your access card, Captain.

14:12.500 --> 14:13.500
[grunts]

14:30.333 --> 14:32.416
You. Front and center.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.583
Where is your captain?

14:36.666 --> 14:40.416
Uh, captaining.

14:40.500 --> 14:46.708
Yes, well, there is an inconsistency
with this shuttle's base of origin.

14:46.791 --> 14:49.333
I will need you to verify
your vessel's signature key.

14:49.416 --> 14:52.750
Um, sure thing, boss. Right this way.

14:55.416 --> 14:56.416
[lieutenant grunts]

14:59.875 --> 15:04.291
This is taking far too long.
Can you crack the encryption or not?

15:04.375 --> 15:05.500
I'm working on it.

15:07.166 --> 15:08.166
[grunts]

15:08.250 --> 15:10.875
[Wrecker on comm] Hunter,
I had to sideline an Imperial.

15:10.958 --> 15:12.958
Someone might come looking for him.

15:13.041 --> 15:15.291
[Hunter] Copy that.
Have the shuttle ready to go.

15:15.375 --> 15:16.583
[console beeping]

15:17.666 --> 15:18.916
I'm in.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.625
A science vessel docked in Bay 8
is set to depart for Tantiss, and soon.

15:23.708 --> 15:26.625
Let's get to that navicomputer
and pull the coordinates.

15:26.708 --> 15:30.791
We can't. The vessel is tagged
for direct uplink after it launches.

15:30.875 --> 15:33.250
[Crosshair] Which means
there's no way to get the coordinates.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.375
Did that slip your mind?

15:35.458 --> 15:38.083
You expect me to know
technical details like that?

15:38.166 --> 15:40.333
[Hunter]
Then there's only one option left.

15:40.416 --> 15:44.875
We can't extract those coordinates.
But that vessel is heading to Tantiss.

15:44.958 --> 15:47.125
-That's our way in.
-What?

15:47.208 --> 15:51.166
It's the only chance we have of finding
Omega and freeing those clone prisoners.

15:51.250 --> 15:55.041
[sighs] Science vessels have
heightened security protocols.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.625
There's no way
you can all sneak aboard undetected.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.416
But I can.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.083
[Crosshair] You can't go alone.

16:01.916 --> 16:03.166
He's not.

16:03.250 --> 16:06.958
Once you're aboard, find a way
to disable the proximity sensors.

16:07.041 --> 16:08.166
We'll follow behind,

16:08.250 --> 16:12.375
then attach our shuttle to the hull
and hitch a ride directly to Tantiss.

16:12.458 --> 16:16.833
Now, wait just a minute.
This is not the plan I agreed to.

16:16.916 --> 16:18.708
Plans change.

16:18.791 --> 16:21.708
[Hunter] They'll monitor comms.
So, we'll have to go radio silent.

16:22.333 --> 16:23.500
Watch your back.

16:31.333 --> 16:34.291
Wonderful. We're all going to die.

16:49.125 --> 16:50.625
[cooing]

17:54.500 --> 17:56.083
[clattering]

18:16.750 --> 18:17.916
Hello, Dr. Scalder.

18:20.041 --> 18:22.250
Is something wrong?

18:25.541 --> 18:26.541
Hmm.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.125
[sighs]

18:44.750 --> 18:46.666
-Well?
-Did it work?

18:47.291 --> 18:48.291
Uh-huh.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.416
What did you find?

18:51.791 --> 18:53.708
Our way out.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.333
[Imperial pilot] Yes, sir.

20:44.416 --> 20:45.500
'Bout time.

20:52.791 --> 20:54.375
[Echo on comm]
Hunter, I'm inside the ship.

20:54.458 --> 20:56.583
It's launching right now.

20:56.666 --> 20:58.250
Get those sensors disabled.

20:58.333 --> 20:59.458
We need to move.

Sir, picking up unscheduled droid activity
in the cargo hold.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.458
Get eyes on it.

21:46.083 --> 21:47.958
-[Wrecker] What are you waiting for?
-[console beeping]

21:48.041 --> 21:50.791
The proximity sensors
haven't been deactivated yet.

21:50.875 --> 21:56.291
This isn't going to work. Their proximity
sensors will detect us and shoot us down.

21:56.375 --> 21:59.166
Relax. Echo's on it.

22:12.125 --> 22:15.125
