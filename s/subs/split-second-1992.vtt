WEBVTT

03:05.695 --> 03:09.066
731 arriving at Lockup 16.
Prisoner on board.

03:09.166 --> 03:12.929
- Request assistance.
- Affirmative. Proceed to Bay 2.

03:20.313 --> 03:21.516
This is Thrasher.

03:21.616 --> 03:24.386
All units be on the lookout
for Detective Stone.

03:24.486 --> 03:26.423
He's armed and dangerous.

03:26.523 --> 03:29.025
If anyone spots him,
report to me immediately.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.860
Durkin, where the hell are you?

03:30.960 --> 03:33.800
I've located Stone,
passing Trafalgar Square.

03:33.900 --> 03:35.896
On his tail, sir.

03:37.136 --> 03:41.242
While the United States blocks yet
another UN resolution on global warming...

03:41.342 --> 03:43.178
London continues to suffer...

03:43.278 --> 03:47.718
as the River Thames rises to its highest
level since Black November, 1999.

03:47.818 --> 03:50.522
With the approaching full moon
and persistent rains...

03:50.622 --> 03:53.892
the further outlook
for Londoners appears bleak.

03:53.992 --> 03:58.230
As the tides continue to rise,
the dramatic increase in rat infestation...

03:58.330 --> 04:00.334
is evident throughout the city.

04:00.434 --> 04:03.504
Those attacked should report
to their local rodent center...

04:03.604 --> 04:06.330
for immediate medical attention.

05:40.499 --> 05:42.292
Police, dickhead.

05:46.740 --> 05:49.909
Â£50, two drinks minimum.

06:11.007 --> 06:12.901
- Watch him.
- Okay.

06:42.280 --> 06:43.469
Damn it.

06:49.856 --> 06:53.255
- What can I get you?
- You got coffee?

06:53.428 --> 06:55.399
It's two drinks minimum.

06:55.499 --> 06:58.634
Give me two coffees, extra sugar.

07:08.382 --> 07:09.981
Access code.

07:13.755 --> 07:17.626
- Special Unit, can I help you?
- Get me Pat O'Donnell please.

07:17.726 --> 07:19.919
One moment, I'll transfer you.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.331
Come on, Pat.

07:24.135 --> 07:27.440
Excuse me, please, I have to pee.
Will you watch the door for me?

07:27.540 --> 07:30.209
- Sure, babe.
- Thank you.

07:31.811 --> 07:34.311
Don't be a creep and peek, okay?

07:35.416 --> 07:38.053
- O'Donnell, here.
- Hi, Pat. This is Stone, here.

07:38.153 --> 07:41.424
- Don't call me, you were just suspended.
- Did you get the report yet?

07:41.524 --> 07:44.260
No, maybe the bastard
won't show this time.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.120
He'll show.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.724
I know he will.

07:50.838 --> 07:54.736
I need some coffee.
Where the fuck is my coffee?

08:07.326 --> 08:09.289
I know you're here.

08:51.851 --> 08:53.713
Son of a bitch.

09:00.261 --> 09:02.226
Freeze! Don't move.

09:02.965 --> 09:05.066
Show me your hands, man.

09:08.974 --> 09:11.368
Somebody must have seen something.

09:12.277 --> 09:13.671
You?

09:21.958 --> 09:24.183
You know something.

09:24.561 --> 09:26.694
What about you, dickhead?

09:27.699 --> 09:29.067
I know.

09:29.167 --> 09:31.233
I know you saw him.

09:54.066 --> 09:56.462
- Where did he go?
- Don't shoot!

09:56.970 --> 09:59.731
- Talk to me!
- I didn't see anything!

09:59.906 --> 10:01.803
- Freeze!
- Police!

10:02.777 --> 10:04.606
Get out of my way!

10:19.166 --> 10:21.059
God!

10:28.203 --> 10:30.395
I can hear your heartbeat.

10:33.109 --> 10:34.799
I'll find you.

10:37.982 --> 10:39.410
You fuck!

10:48.430 --> 10:49.397
Then what?

10:49.497 --> 10:51.868
He started raving like a lunatic,
out of control.

10:51.968 --> 10:54.070
It took four officers to subdue him.

10:54.170 --> 10:56.038
- Where is he now?
- Lockup.

10:56.138 --> 10:57.568
What happened to him?

10:57.808 --> 11:01.446
A serial killer murdered his partner,
Foster, three years ago.

11:01.546 --> 11:03.148
He was there when it happened.

11:03.248 --> 11:06.713
- Survivor's guilt.
- Just plain guilt.

11:06.887 --> 11:09.557
Had an affair
with Foster's wife, left her...

11:09.657 --> 11:12.027
hit the booze, went over the edge.

11:12.127 --> 11:15.093
Now he lives on anxiety,
coffee and chocolate.

11:15.231 --> 11:17.457
If you ask me, he's nuts.

11:18.102 --> 11:21.761
That's what the doctors say.
Here, read the file.

11:22.374 --> 11:26.379
He's worked in every hellhole in the world
and been fired from all of them.

11:26.479 --> 11:29.740
- They say he's the best.
- He is.

11:30.452 --> 11:33.755
I followed him down an alleyway.
He shot a trashcan.

11:33.855 --> 11:35.717
Sounds like Stone.

11:36.059 --> 11:39.930
- Maybe you'll be a soothing influence.
- Pardon me?

11:40.030 --> 11:41.824
He's your new partner.

11:45.670 --> 11:48.237
What's the matter with you, Stone?

11:48.407 --> 11:51.738
- Where's my other piece, Pat?
- You mean the cannon.

11:52.480 --> 11:53.648
The Chief's got that.

11:53.748 --> 11:56.577
He said he wanted to see you,
said it was urgent.

12:02.827 --> 12:04.289
Hiya, Stone!

12:08.034 --> 12:09.724
Get a move on.

12:18.915 --> 12:21.811
- Careful, sweetheart.
- It's good to have you back.

12:42.646 --> 12:44.747
What the fuck are you doing here?

12:47.719 --> 12:50.080
I thought you were suspended.

13:01.103 --> 13:03.636
Stone, get your ass in here!

13:20.863 --> 13:25.195
- What the fuck's this?
- Hi, Chief. How are you doing?

13:25.569 --> 13:27.703
Answer the question.

13:28.507 --> 13:30.106
It's a gun.

13:30.843 --> 13:33.204
Don't be a smart-ass. This isn't funny.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.374
I'm not laughing.

13:36.451 --> 13:38.380
The killer is back.

13:39.387 --> 13:42.284
I thought you said
this guy wouldn't be back.

13:42.392 --> 13:46.297
Sir, all research shows that a serial killer
of this type doesn't come back.

13:46.397 --> 13:49.568
- Who is this?
- Detective Dick Durkin.

13:49.968 --> 13:52.505
- Are you sure it's him?
- He ripped her heart out.

13:52.605 --> 13:56.435
- Her heart? What for?
- Maybe he eats them for breakfast.

14:00.449 --> 14:02.652
This wasn't in the police reports
or the papers.

14:02.752 --> 14:05.650
It's never going to be. You got that?

14:05.888 --> 14:09.126
Jesus, if they get wind of this,
they'll have a field day.

14:09.226 --> 14:11.157
This changes things.

14:11.630 --> 14:14.667
I thought we were dealing
with a psychotic, not a psychopath.

14:14.767 --> 14:16.903
With such incredible strength,
he must be...

14:17.003 --> 14:20.007
under extreme mental distress
or on some kind of stimulant.

14:20.107 --> 14:21.673
Who is this?

14:22.877 --> 14:26.916
I'm curious. How did you know he was
going to strike at that club last night?

14:27.016 --> 14:27.985
I didn't.

14:28.085 --> 14:30.721
- But you were there before he struck.
- So?

14:30.821 --> 14:33.456
That's an incredible coincidence.

14:34.160 --> 14:38.492
Do you know what this is?
It's a medical report on you.

14:40.735 --> 14:45.396
The doctors say you have anxiety neurosis
to the point of being paranoid.

14:45.608 --> 14:47.834
Doctors don't know shit.

14:48.179 --> 14:51.177
How many weapons are you carrying,
besides this cannon?

14:52.017 --> 14:54.378
- An MP-15.
- What else?

14:55.488 --> 14:57.315
- A Glock 50.
- And?

14:58.157 --> 15:00.462
An A-3 assault shotgun.

15:00.562 --> 15:04.323
If that's not paranoid,
I don't know what the fuck is.

15:05.067 --> 15:07.734
I'm surprised you don't have
a grenade launcher.

15:07.904 --> 15:11.165
- I couldn't get a permit.
- This isn't funny!

15:14.913 --> 15:17.775
- I just want to be ready.
- Ready for what?

15:18.551 --> 15:21.222
You can't even find the bastard,
let alone shoot him.

15:21.322 --> 15:22.723
I can find him.

15:22.823 --> 15:25.127
If you know so much about this fella...

15:25.227 --> 15:27.830
how come we've got a corpse
with her heart ripped out?

15:27.930 --> 15:31.191
And you're up alleyways
shooting at water rats.

15:32.803 --> 15:36.167
- Have you been following me?
- Damn right, he has.

15:36.743 --> 15:39.746
Paranoid people with guns
are a menace to society.

15:39.846 --> 15:43.284
You'd be paranoid, too, if you had
a dipshit like this following you.

15:43.384 --> 15:46.521
This dipshit happens to be
an expert on serial killers.

15:46.621 --> 15:50.590
If he's such an expert,
what the fuck is he following me for?

15:53.597 --> 15:56.096
You're officially off suspension.

15:58.771 --> 15:59.939
But if you fuck up again...

16:00.039 --> 16:03.377
I'll have your arse shipped
to the worst hellhole on this planet.

16:03.477 --> 16:05.543
Worse than this place?

16:05.780 --> 16:09.144
And there's a condition, Stone,
my condition.

16:09.685 --> 16:11.546
He goes with you.

16:12.489 --> 16:13.890
I work alone.

16:13.990 --> 16:16.829
You work with who I say,
or you don't work at all.

16:16.929 --> 16:20.367
'Cause as far as I'm concerned,
you're just another crazy with a gun.

16:20.467 --> 16:23.659
Your concern for my welfare is touching.

16:24.805 --> 16:27.236
Get the fuck out of my office.

16:33.317 --> 16:35.145
You got a pen?

16:40.025 --> 16:43.262
Detective Dick Durkin, you got a car?

16:43.362 --> 16:46.863
- Yeah, of course.
- You take yours, I'll take mine.

16:47.969 --> 16:50.297
Hey, Stone. What's this?

16:50.672 --> 16:53.273
- Are you going on a picnic?
- What, pal?

16:53.476 --> 16:56.077
Having your own booze delivered now?

16:58.049 --> 17:01.454
- Don't touch it! Where did you get this?
- Somebody wheeled it in.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.619
- Who did?
- I don't know.

17:03.924 --> 17:06.491
Did anybody see who delivered this?

17:06.861 --> 17:08.358
Nobody?

17:08.696 --> 17:09.732
Don't.

17:09.832 --> 17:11.300
- It's cold.
- What?

17:11.401 --> 17:14.536
- Cold enough to be full of beers?
- What's going on?

17:20.244 --> 17:21.470
All right.

17:23.750 --> 17:24.939
Open it.

17:38.570 --> 17:40.203
Paranoid?

17:40.872 --> 17:42.734
Seal off the building. Now!

17:44.376 --> 17:45.635
It's too late.

17:45.779 --> 17:49.619
Get Forensics on this.
I wanna know who delivered it and when.

17:49.961 --> 17:52.494
Durkin, stick with him.

17:52.999 --> 17:56.898
I want a mold from these teeth imprints,
and I want them now!

18:02.779 --> 18:03.969
Hi.

18:05.215 --> 18:07.350
Can I ask you something?

18:07.652 --> 18:09.789
Where'd you get your training?

18:09.889 --> 18:13.427
I come from Lochgilphead in Argyll,
but we moved to Glasgow when I was 4.

18:13.527 --> 18:17.066
I got my first degree there,
then I did postgraduate in Edinburgh...

18:17.166 --> 18:20.858
and after I decided to join the police,
I went to Oxford.

18:23.138 --> 18:24.671
Stay there.

19:10.635 --> 19:13.269
Don't move or I'll blow your head off.

19:13.571 --> 19:15.603
What the hell are you doing here?

19:16.008 --> 19:20.579
- I'm trying to think. Do you mind?
- You must be sick, laying in wet blood.

19:23.785 --> 19:27.583
You saw him, didn't you? I know you did.

19:28.425 --> 19:32.393
You can see him. I can see him.

19:32.831 --> 19:36.169
That also means I'm not crazy.

19:36.269 --> 19:37.835
What the hell are you doing?

19:42.544 --> 19:44.076
Excuse me.

19:44.513 --> 19:47.011
I was talking to your secretary.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.816
What the hell are you doing?

19:56.129 --> 20:00.288
80 percent of all accidents
are caused by poor visibility.

20:03.004 --> 20:08.107
All units in the vicinity go to 227 Maple
to investigate a homicide.

20:09.113 --> 20:12.147
- Stone.
- Looks as though he's struck again.

20:12.516 --> 20:13.775
On my way.

20:15.687 --> 20:17.617
Follow me, Dick!

21:14.698 --> 21:16.059
Sorry.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.852
- What floor?
- Fourth.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.930
- What's going on?
- ID, sir.

21:46.173 --> 21:48.273
Detective Dick Durkin.

21:52.514 --> 21:54.151
What have you got?

21:54.251 --> 21:56.784
What's left of a 28-year-old man.

21:57.855 --> 21:59.956
His heart's been torn out.

22:01.058 --> 22:03.228
What are you doing?
I thought you were suspended.

22:03.328 --> 22:06.726
I was. You got a time of death?

22:08.569 --> 22:11.606
It's a guess, but I'd place
the TOD somewhere around...

22:11.706 --> 22:13.876
- 6:30.
- Yes.

22:15.380 --> 22:17.274
How do you know that?

22:33.770 --> 22:35.802
Is it always like this?

22:38.943 --> 22:40.974
It's always like this.

22:52.160 --> 22:53.759
I hate rats.

22:54.197 --> 22:56.193
Sorry about the suit.

23:14.824 --> 23:16.116
Damn.

23:17.728 --> 23:19.327
What is it?

23:20.264 --> 23:21.829
It's a message for me.

23:22.233 --> 23:25.871
- How do you know it's for you?
- This is my partner's.

23:30.511 --> 23:32.338
What is that?

23:34.349 --> 23:36.915
Looks like an astrological symbol.

23:37.619 --> 23:40.914
It is. A symbol for Scorpio.

23:41.625 --> 23:45.887
Inverted triangle inside a circle,
that's using the occult.

23:46.232 --> 23:49.334
"25, 78." Don't know what that means.

23:50.469 --> 23:53.231
- Has he ever done this before?
- No.

23:53.908 --> 23:56.645
I wonder if he stood
on the bed to paint it.

23:56.745 --> 23:59.018
If he did, he shouldn't
be too hard to find.

23:59.118 --> 24:00.110
Why?

24:01.084 --> 24:03.310
He'd have to be 10 feet tall.

24:05.391 --> 24:08.560
- What do you know about the occult?
- Nothing.

24:08.961 --> 24:10.831
I thought you went to school.

24:10.931 --> 24:14.035
I did, but the occult
wasn't on the curriculum.

24:14.135 --> 24:16.496
What about this Scorpio stuff?

24:17.038 --> 24:18.934
Are you serious?

24:19.408 --> 24:22.011
- You must read your horoscope.
- Why?

24:22.111 --> 24:24.474
Got a present for you, Stone.

24:25.316 --> 24:26.852
Chief asked me to give you this.

24:26.952 --> 24:30.290
It's the cast of the dentition,
from the heart this morning.

24:30.390 --> 24:33.024
Take this to the lab
and have it checked.

24:33.427 --> 24:35.596
Now. You got a problem with that?

24:35.696 --> 24:39.891
Yeah, the same problem I got with you.
Who the fuck do you think you are?

24:40.802 --> 24:43.540
Bring this to the lab right now!
I don't have time for this!

24:43.640 --> 24:47.480
Don't think everybody's not going
to hear about this because they are.

24:47.580 --> 24:51.307
- What were you saying?
- A little tension between you two?

24:51.585 --> 24:53.184
Shut up.

24:58.447 --> 25:00.274
Go on.

25:30.855 --> 25:32.489
Show me your face!

25:39.068 --> 25:40.735
Foster!

25:44.274 --> 25:45.576
Freeze!

25:45.676 --> 25:47.936
He's a police officer! Back off!

25:48.346 --> 25:50.310
Back!

25:50.582 --> 25:51.874
Okay.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.753
What happened?

25:56.490 --> 25:58.682
He's out here somewhere.

25:58.893 --> 26:02.621
- How do you know?
- I'm telling you, he's watching.

26:18.485 --> 26:20.619
Can I ask you a question?

26:23.591 --> 26:24.885
What?

26:25.462 --> 26:28.495
- What happened back there?
- We got close.

26:28.801 --> 26:31.561
- How do you know?
- That's two questions.

26:37.310 --> 26:41.072
How do you know what time
the second victim was killed?

26:45.655 --> 26:47.949
Are you psychic or something?

26:48.625 --> 26:52.664
- Your fucking attitude is driving me nuts.
- Word is, you are nuts.

26:52.764 --> 26:53.965
I shouldn't have said that...

26:54.065 --> 26:57.497
but since we're working together,
it's best if we're honest.

26:58.738 --> 27:02.042
We're not working together
and I'm not nuts.

27:02.142 --> 27:03.708
Okay.

27:04.579 --> 27:08.410
Was it Paulsen that turned you in
for the report that got you suspended?

27:08.718 --> 27:11.217
It's just a rumor that I heard.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.147
Zip up, Dick.

27:20.267 --> 27:23.130
Are there any similarities
in the victims?

27:23.404 --> 27:27.010
You may not like me, but I'm good.
I have an Honors in Serial Homicide.

27:27.110 --> 27:28.743
Terrific.

27:29.846 --> 27:33.517
I spent a year with Behavioral Science
Division studying serial killers...

27:33.617 --> 27:35.254
and another year with Interpol.

27:35.354 --> 27:38.752
I'm not some idiot
straight out of police school.

27:38.925 --> 27:41.616
Did you know Charles Manson
was a Scorpio?

27:47.737 --> 27:51.140
Before yesterday, I thought
we were dealing with a psychotic.

27:51.240 --> 27:55.879
Then, after you told me about the hearts,
I was convinced he was a psychopath.

27:56.980 --> 27:59.946
And seeing what he did,
I'd have to say he's both.

28:01.121 --> 28:03.619
A psychotic
with a psychopathic personality.

28:09.732 --> 28:11.769
There are no similarities
between the victims.

28:11.869 --> 28:15.139
- There has to be.
- This beast doesn't care what it kills.

28:15.239 --> 28:16.875
Why do you call him a beast?

28:16.975 --> 28:19.337
What would you call something...

28:20.780 --> 28:23.074
with teeth like this?

28:49.551 --> 28:51.981
- Give me your keys.
- What for?

28:52.288 --> 28:54.080
Give me your keys.

28:56.326 --> 28:58.792
A present from my girlfriend.

29:00.867 --> 29:02.556
Where are we going?

29:03.471 --> 29:05.501
You're not going anywhere.

29:08.109 --> 29:09.936
That's not fair.

29:48.629 --> 29:50.091
Michelle?

29:52.400 --> 29:53.795
No, King Kong.

29:56.239 --> 29:58.772
- What are you doing here?
- Same as you.

30:01.245 --> 30:05.405
I come here every time I come to London.

30:09.957 --> 30:11.819
I just called you.

30:12.494 --> 30:14.060
You did?

30:16.399 --> 30:19.236
Your answering machine
wasn't working so I...

30:19.336 --> 30:20.833
Hung up.

30:25.710 --> 30:29.005
- You look very pretty.
- You look like shit.

30:31.618 --> 30:32.911
Thanks.

30:34.122 --> 30:37.189
When was the last time
you got some sleep?

30:38.862 --> 30:40.894
Maybe four days ago.

30:43.435 --> 30:47.401
His killer is still around
and I don't know if I can get him.

30:48.708 --> 30:51.742
Then don't try.
Just give it up and walk away.

30:54.616 --> 30:56.217
I can't.

31:00.023 --> 31:02.487
How about just for the night?

31:10.336 --> 31:12.437
Better watch your coat.

31:12.639 --> 31:14.501
I've got a lot of greasy stuff.

31:30.630 --> 31:33.857
- Is there a light?
- Right in front of you.

31:40.945 --> 31:43.170
No wonder I couldn't find you.

31:43.447 --> 31:45.484
Were you looking for me?

31:45.584 --> 31:47.876
Yes, I was looking for you.

31:48.086 --> 31:50.754
Could we open a window?

31:55.162 --> 31:56.955
Get out of here.

31:58.299 --> 32:00.263
Windows are broken.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.534
I can open that door.

32:05.542 --> 32:08.041
Thanks. That's a little better.

32:14.254 --> 32:16.423
I'm sorry I disappeared.

32:16.523 --> 32:18.759
It wasn't your fault
any more than it was mine.

32:18.859 --> 32:21.324
That's just the way it happened.

32:31.544 --> 32:34.737
When was the last time
you cleaned this place?

32:34.914 --> 32:36.743
I don't remember.

32:38.653 --> 32:40.719
It's good to see you.

32:41.290 --> 32:43.823
I hear that you were suspended.

32:44.394 --> 32:46.222
Word gets around.

32:46.397 --> 32:49.726
No, Paulsen called.
He and Foster were close.

32:51.836 --> 32:54.062
You still on the wagon?

32:55.908 --> 32:57.633
- Yeah.
- Good.

33:00.113 --> 33:02.240
I just brought one of the kids
from Newcastle.

33:02.340 --> 33:05.076
- You've got kids now?
- No, I work with children.

33:05.176 --> 33:08.676
There's a lot of kids
that need psychological help.

33:10.250 --> 33:11.941
That's really nice.

33:14.089 --> 33:16.519
- Yeah.
- Sorry about the pigeons.

33:17.058 --> 33:18.954
I can't kill 'em.

33:22.467 --> 33:24.328
How's Foster's mom?

33:25.837 --> 33:27.231
The same.

33:28.174 --> 33:31.343
- I don't think she'll ever get over it.
- Yes.

33:33.714 --> 33:35.346
How are you?

33:36.351 --> 33:38.041
Me? I'm crazy as ever.

33:41.658 --> 33:43.223
I miss him.

33:47.365 --> 33:48.794
I miss him, too.

33:51.470 --> 33:53.639
I'll make some coffee.

33:55.075 --> 33:56.903
Don't you have any real food?

35:02.265 --> 35:04.228
It's midnight. Tide's coming up.

35:05.969 --> 35:09.469
- Come on.
- Let's go get a beer. There's nothing here.

35:18.118 --> 35:20.617
Foster?

35:33.305 --> 35:35.132
Come on.

36:13.424 --> 36:15.923
Durkin, you're sick.

37:46.213 --> 37:47.711
Freeze!

37:47.916 --> 37:49.174
You want breakfast?

37:50.820 --> 37:52.008
No.

37:52.421 --> 37:54.179
Fine, I'll drive.

37:58.362 --> 37:59.552
Hop in.

38:09.977 --> 38:13.348
Are you telling me you guys
from Oxford don't eat breakfast?

38:13.448 --> 38:15.810
Yeah, right after I run.

38:16.787 --> 38:18.256
- You what?
- Run.

38:18.356 --> 38:20.524
Five miles every morning.

38:20.893 --> 38:24.585
- What's the matter, you don't get laid?
- Yeah, every night.

38:26.433 --> 38:30.071
You get laid every night,
and you run five miles every morning?

38:30.171 --> 38:32.340
Yeah. Except Sundays.

38:32.675 --> 38:37.210
My girlfriend and I stay in bed
and fool around.

38:40.385 --> 38:42.486
That's disgusting.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.321
What is it?

38:46.725 --> 38:48.895
Nothing. I need coffee.

39:10.024 --> 39:11.749
What's this?

39:12.227 --> 39:16.160
Books: paranormal psychology,
astrology, the occult.

39:16.632 --> 39:20.325
- You read them all?
- Last night, after sex.

39:23.743 --> 39:25.342
Do you mind?

39:25.643 --> 39:27.948
You smoke too much,
drink too much coffee...

39:28.048 --> 39:30.617
- ... and eat too much sugar.
- Helps ease the tension.

39:30.717 --> 39:34.115
I can get rid of that.
Massage is one of my hobbies.

39:35.124 --> 39:38.662
That's it. Now, just relax.
Let the tension flow.

39:38.762 --> 39:42.899
Listen, pal,
touching me is not a great idea.

39:43.968 --> 39:45.830
We're cops, okay?

40:24.555 --> 40:26.621
- How's it going?
- Good.

40:28.159 --> 40:31.057
Get me some breakfast, coffee.

40:35.136 --> 40:38.794
Could I have a Lapsang Souchong
and a croissant, please?

40:42.645 --> 40:45.906
You know, I think you have
supernatural powers.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.856
- You read that in one of your books?
- Yeah.

40:52.291 --> 40:57.026
In the Black Masque.
I collect them, it is one of my hobbies.

40:57.126 --> 41:01.198
- Do you have any hobbies?
- Not since I gave up drinking.

41:01.298 --> 41:03.364
You quit drinking? Good for you.

41:04.603 --> 41:07.795
What is it about you
that reminds me of my mom?

41:08.041 --> 41:09.509
Maybe because I'm so charming.

41:09.609 --> 41:13.267
My mom was a lot of things,
she was not charming.

41:17.385 --> 41:20.077
- God, I love this job.
- Interested?

41:41.284 --> 41:43.545
It's really good.

41:43.654 --> 41:46.057
I hear you used to be a good cop.
My croissant?

41:46.157 --> 41:48.450
What else? You got some salt?

41:48.561 --> 41:50.786
Then you went a bit loopy.

41:51.965 --> 41:54.224
That could be why you're psychic.

41:54.702 --> 41:56.471
I just feel things, that's all.

41:56.571 --> 41:59.172
I hate to break the news,
but that's what psychic is.

42:18.265 --> 42:21.402
I think you and this killer
are on the same psychic wavelength.

42:21.502 --> 42:23.831
What sign were you born under?

42:24.875 --> 42:27.377
- I don't remember.
- Come on. When's your birthday?

42:27.477 --> 42:30.014
- November 10.
- You're a Scorpio.

42:30.114 --> 42:33.547
- So what?
- That's the sign he drew on the ceiling.

42:50.107 --> 42:52.641
You ever asked yourself
why he sent you the heart?

42:57.284 --> 42:59.953
Maybe it's because he thinks
you lack compassion.

43:00.053 --> 43:01.448
Are you trying to be funny?

43:11.368 --> 43:12.728
Great!

43:15.374 --> 43:17.508
I've been wondering...

43:19.514 --> 43:22.445
why he only kills during the high tide.

43:22.985 --> 43:25.221
I'll bet it has something
to do with the...

43:25.321 --> 43:30.584
astrological alignment of the stars
in conjunction with the new moon.

43:32.865 --> 43:35.056
Scorpio is a water sign.

43:35.635 --> 43:37.872
The highest tide pulls in the new moon.

43:37.972 --> 43:41.675
That's just off the top of my head.
You probably have a better idea.

43:41.775 --> 43:43.375
No, I don't.

43:51.054 --> 43:54.092
He shows up every month
on the night of the new moon...

43:54.192 --> 43:57.419
he kills before midnight,
in different locations...

43:57.897 --> 44:00.167
then he disappears.
We don't have a motive.

44:00.267 --> 44:02.703
- We don't have a pattern.
- Slow down.

44:02.803 --> 44:06.461
The only thing we know for sure
is that he's not a vegetarian.

44:13.118 --> 44:14.545
Stone?

44:16.922 --> 44:20.821
Okay, dipshit, your turn.
What do you make of all this?

44:26.835 --> 44:30.061
I don't care about your degrees
or secondhand knowledge.

44:30.206 --> 44:33.205
I want to know what you think. You.

44:34.111 --> 44:37.917
Any units in the area, report.
There's an intruder at 16 Roselle Street.

44:38.017 --> 44:40.014
- That's...
- My place.

44:49.331 --> 44:50.793
My shotgun.

44:51.867 --> 44:53.660
Call for backup. Now!

45:05.519 --> 45:06.981
Michelle?

45:39.430 --> 45:40.995
Where is he?

45:43.235 --> 45:45.405
If this is a joke,
I don't think it's funny.

45:45.505 --> 45:48.408
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a shower.

45:48.508 --> 45:50.011
- You're taking a shower?
- Yes.

45:50.111 --> 45:53.349
- I heard screaming.
- The water got colder!

45:53.449 --> 45:56.483
- The door is open.
- I didn't open it.

46:00.759 --> 46:02.187
Lock it!

46:08.002 --> 46:10.172
- What are you doing?
- They're on their way.

46:10.272 --> 46:11.769
She's okay.

46:28.795 --> 46:30.224
Get back here!

46:42.947 --> 46:44.775
Stupid son of a bitch!

47:47.767 --> 47:50.801
I'd better find Durkin.

47:53.340 --> 47:55.772
Stone! For Christ's sake!

47:58.280 --> 48:00.917
- It bit me!
- Don't worry about it.

48:01.017 --> 48:03.277
- What?
- I'll get the medics.

48:04.188 --> 48:06.083
Come on, move back!

48:30.522 --> 48:33.795
Her chest was ripped open.
He must have used a hatchet.

48:33.895 --> 48:36.826
No, he used his hands.

48:54.587 --> 48:56.222
You saw him, didn't you?

49:17.217 --> 49:19.613
The guy's hyperventilating.

49:20.689 --> 49:22.482
Okay, come on.

49:24.227 --> 49:26.598
I'm okay. Need some fresh air.

49:26.698 --> 49:28.229
Give him space.

49:31.537 --> 49:34.229
Just calm down. Breathe in deep.

49:34.507 --> 49:36.368
Easy, fella.

49:51.795 --> 49:54.368
Hey, Harley!

50:01.378 --> 50:02.771
Foster?

50:13.995 --> 50:15.685
Jesus!

50:16.265 --> 50:19.162
Foster? Come on, pal.

50:31.484 --> 50:34.553
- Jesus.
- Stone, are you all right?

50:35.690 --> 50:37.118
Dick.

50:39.295 --> 50:42.599
- What are you doing here?
- No wonder you have panic attacks.

50:42.699 --> 50:46.804
- That's it! That's your psychic connection.
- You're supposed to be dead.

50:46.904 --> 50:51.371
You've never heard of a bulletproof vest?
Man, watch out. Right.

50:53.047 --> 50:55.681
Don't you ask me why I did that.

51:05.230 --> 51:08.923
- You'll be okay.
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

51:11.171 --> 51:13.362
Did you see anything?

51:14.174 --> 51:18.779
No, I saw a flash and then I felt the pain,
but that's all I remember.

51:21.918 --> 51:24.952
Michelle, I'd like a word
with you, please.

51:26.089 --> 51:28.315
Catch up with you later.

51:46.049 --> 51:49.378
I'm sorry, it's my lighter.

52:02.572 --> 52:05.832
- Where's the report from the lab?
- On your desk.

52:06.343 --> 52:09.412
- What did you find out?
- Read the report.

52:09.647 --> 52:11.508
What did you find out?

52:12.184 --> 52:14.875
Traces of Leptospira interrogans.

52:16.088 --> 52:17.025
What?

52:17.125 --> 52:20.693
That's the rat virus
that causes Weil's disease.

52:21.563 --> 52:23.666
- Any fingerprints?
- Just one set.

52:23.766 --> 52:25.201
- Did you bring them in?
- No.

52:25.301 --> 52:28.198
- Why not?
- Because they were Foster's.

52:28.773 --> 52:32.101
Your old partner, my best friend.
Do you remember him?

52:33.979 --> 52:35.515
Get your fucking hands off me.

52:35.615 --> 52:39.019
You want to tell me
why you turned me in for a medical?

52:39.119 --> 52:41.690
- You really want to know?
- Tell me.

52:41.790 --> 52:44.727
Not because you caused
the death of your best friend...

52:44.827 --> 52:48.866
not because you ran away with his wife,
not because you then dumped her...

52:48.966 --> 52:51.070
but because you're past it.

52:51.170 --> 52:53.739
You're a liability.
You're a fucking menace!

52:53.839 --> 52:55.530
Get your hands off him!

52:56.242 --> 52:57.636
Relax.

52:58.746 --> 53:00.743
Get in my office. Now!

53:10.260 --> 53:12.063
You know what I just heard?

53:12.163 --> 53:16.698
You came face to face with the killer
and unloaded a full clip at him.

53:20.140 --> 53:22.241
The word is you missed.

53:22.610 --> 53:25.948
- Do you know me to miss?
- You saying you hit him?

53:26.048 --> 53:30.221
- I didn't miss. That's what I'm saying.
- Then why the fuck isn't he dead?

53:30.321 --> 53:35.256
I unloaded a full clip,
450 Magnum, point blank.

53:36.062 --> 53:39.060
It disappeared. Vanished in front of me.

53:39.565 --> 53:42.496
You are telling me
this guy is superhuman?

53:42.636 --> 53:47.036
I don't know what he is,
sure as hell ain't like you or me.

53:47.509 --> 53:48.578
What is it?

53:48.678 --> 53:51.081
Genetic fingerprints
have come back from the lab.

53:51.181 --> 53:53.281
I think you should see this.

53:56.555 --> 53:58.157
What the hell is this?

53:58.257 --> 54:01.595
Multiple restriction,
polymorphic DNA sequences.

54:01.695 --> 54:02.763
Bullshit.

54:02.863 --> 54:06.090
It has the DNA structure
of all its victims.

54:07.870 --> 54:10.197
It says here it's got rat DNA.

54:12.175 --> 54:14.275
It's got your DNA, too.

54:16.113 --> 54:18.550
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

54:18.650 --> 54:21.320
- Durkin, stick with him.
- Yes, sir.

54:21.420 --> 54:23.954
- And, Durkin...
- Sir?

54:24.292 --> 54:25.982
Watch your ass.

54:50.793 --> 54:54.332
If it makes you feel any better,
those DNA reports can be wrong.

54:54.432 --> 54:56.155
Yeah, right.

54:56.734 --> 54:58.903
He didn't get her heart.

55:05.912 --> 55:07.741
What did you say?

55:07.948 --> 55:10.982
The last victim's heart,
he didn't get it.

55:12.555 --> 55:15.282
That means it's going to come back.

55:19.732 --> 55:21.593
Are you ready to die?

55:21.800 --> 55:22.990
What?

55:23.670 --> 55:25.634
The morgue. Come on!

55:28.143 --> 55:29.344
Get lost!

55:29.444 --> 55:31.374
Excuse me!

55:32.915 --> 55:35.208
Out of my way, you fucks!

55:42.161 --> 55:43.885
He's in there.

56:05.224 --> 56:07.052
I'll wait outside.

56:07.861 --> 56:10.087
Didn't think you'd buy that.

56:32.327 --> 56:34.154
I don't like this.

57:12.914 --> 57:15.140
Don't move or you're dead!

57:16.819 --> 57:20.615
- What are you eating?
- He works here.

57:26.565 --> 57:28.528
- Oxford?
- Yes.

57:29.568 --> 57:30.930
Sorry.

57:31.871 --> 57:33.299
Anytime.

57:46.592 --> 57:48.088
What?

57:51.431 --> 57:52.620
Up there.

57:54.034 --> 57:55.862
I'll be damned.

57:58.500 --> 58:00.566
What's going on here?

58:13.352 --> 58:16.818
- What do you think?
- I think he's gone.

58:17.124 --> 58:18.723
Yeah, right.

58:23.433 --> 58:24.998
You got him!

58:28.772 --> 58:30.564
I know I hit him.

59:03.151 --> 59:05.321
We need bigger guns, Stone.

59:05.421 --> 59:07.317
That's quite a hole.

59:07.423 --> 59:09.760
- Did you get to see him?
- Him?

59:09.860 --> 59:12.564
That wasn't a "him."
That was a fucking "it"!

59:12.664 --> 59:16.858
- We've got to get bigger guns!
- Take a deep breath. Relax.

59:17.370 --> 59:19.299
Okay. Come on.

59:27.317 --> 59:31.388
We need bigger guns, big fucking guns!

59:32.257 --> 59:33.617
Sorry.

59:34.593 --> 59:38.098
We're getting big guns, right?
That's where we're going, to get big guns.

59:38.198 --> 59:41.994
Stone, we need some big fucking guns!

59:44.173 --> 59:47.434
- Another one.
- Did you see his eyes?

59:47.711 --> 59:50.608
All I saw was this...

59:50.881 --> 59:52.242
Drink.

59:54.686 --> 59:57.150
...huge fucking thing.

59:59.458 --> 01:00:01.184
How are you feeling?

01:00:01.395 --> 01:00:04.030
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.801
How?

01:00:06.901 --> 01:00:09.401
- I feel...
- On edge?

01:00:09.572 --> 01:00:11.207
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:00:12.075 --> 01:00:13.936
Have one of these.

01:00:19.653 --> 01:00:23.152
- You really get laid every night?
- Yeah!

01:00:25.894 --> 01:00:27.357
Now what?

01:00:30.867 --> 01:00:33.263
We're going to get bigger guns.

01:00:36.041 --> 01:00:37.675
Hallelujah.

01:00:42.316 --> 01:00:45.975
A-3, high-powered semiautomatic.

01:00:46.555 --> 01:00:48.791
- Something bigger.
- What?

01:00:48.891 --> 01:00:50.493
Does the Chief know you're down here?

01:00:50.593 --> 01:00:53.997
We need big guns. Big fucking guns.

01:00:54.097 --> 01:00:56.001
What the hell's he on?

01:00:56.101 --> 01:00:58.371
- Chocolate.
- Chocolate?

01:00:58.471 --> 01:01:02.274
I want a grenade launcher.
High-capacity 90mm, automatic.

01:01:02.374 --> 01:01:04.304
- Right.
- SA80.

01:01:04.811 --> 01:01:06.947
These are too fucking small!

01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:15.952
No. That's an assault shotgun,
fully automatic.

01:01:16.461 --> 01:01:19.654
Listen, that fires 650 rounds a minute.

01:01:21.034 --> 01:01:22.836
What do you need two for?

01:01:22.936 --> 01:01:25.970
What the fuck is this thing
you're after, a German tank?

01:01:27.109 --> 01:01:29.479
No, that's a Megatron flash grenade.

01:01:29.579 --> 01:01:32.179
You could clear the jungle
with one of these things.

01:01:35.853 --> 01:01:37.885
Bingo! Let's go!

01:01:40.892 --> 01:01:44.325
Right. I was wondering
if one of you guys would sign...

01:01:45.432 --> 01:01:48.870
This thing, it's like the sum total
of every serial killer I've studied.

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:52.340
A single organism made up
of multiple DNA structures.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:56.780
It's as if someone took every serial killer,
and rolled it into one incredible being.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:01:59.884
What are you doing with those things?
Who authorized this?

01:01:59.984 --> 01:02:01.054
Shit!

01:02:01.154 --> 01:02:04.058
- Why didn't I think of that before?
- What?

01:02:04.158 --> 01:02:07.562
"25, 78." 25th year, 78th cycle.

01:02:07.662 --> 01:02:10.766
The Chinese calendar.
2008, now, this year.

01:02:10.866 --> 01:02:13.703
- What are you on about?
- 2008 is the year.

01:02:13.803 --> 01:02:16.240
- Of the rat!
- What the hell are you talking about?

01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:19.410
The inverted triangle
is not only a symbol of evil...

01:02:19.510 --> 01:02:21.045
it also represents water.

01:02:21.145 --> 01:02:23.682
What have you done to him?
He's sounding like you.

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:26.854
- What about the circle?
- Circle is the sign of magic and power.

01:02:26.954 --> 01:02:29.658
Everything inside the circle
is protected from the outside.

01:02:29.758 --> 01:02:31.258
Hello!

01:02:31.358 --> 01:02:34.062
Will somebody please tell me
what the hell's going on here?

01:02:34.162 --> 01:02:37.267
Scorpio is the sign most susceptible
to the powers of darkness.

01:02:37.367 --> 01:02:39.236
To Scorpio, the idea of being joined...

01:02:39.336 --> 01:02:41.673
with a supernatural being
is very important.

01:02:41.773 --> 01:02:44.477
And the most powerful
supernatural being... Satan!

01:02:44.577 --> 01:02:46.145
What are you on about?

01:02:46.245 --> 01:02:49.249
When chaos reigns,
then will the Fallen Angel prevail.

01:02:49.349 --> 01:02:52.253
- What the fuck is he talking about?
- Look around!

01:02:52.353 --> 01:02:55.959
- The world's in chaos!
- I don't believe this shit!

01:02:56.059 --> 01:02:58.662
He's eating human hearts,
for Christ's sake.

01:02:58.762 --> 01:03:01.166
- How do you know?
- We had lunch with him.

01:03:01.266 --> 01:03:03.836
Cannibals ate hearts
to gain possession of souls.

01:03:03.936 --> 01:03:06.272
It believes that if it eats
its victims' hearts...

01:03:06.372 --> 01:03:09.676
it not only gains their power
and their DNA...

01:03:09.776 --> 01:03:12.138
it also gains their souls.

01:03:12.413 --> 01:03:15.951
Are you telling me there's something
running loose in this city...

01:03:16.051 --> 01:03:21.156
ripping out and eating people's hearts
so he can take their souls back to hell?

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:24.385
Looks that way.

01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:27.396
Hallelujah.

01:03:28.267 --> 01:03:30.493
You're both fucking nuts.

01:03:31.872 --> 01:03:33.374
What am I supposed to do?

01:03:33.474 --> 01:03:37.379
Put out an APB on some fucking guy
who looks like the devil?

01:03:37.479 --> 01:03:40.617
Answers to the name of Lucifer?
Yeah, and you!

01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:43.656
I suppose he's got two fucking horns
sticking out of his head!

01:03:43.756 --> 01:03:47.255
Yeah, and a fucking tail!
Fucking get out of the way!

01:03:47.994 --> 01:03:51.164
Jesus Christ! The pair of pricks!

01:04:01.078 --> 01:04:02.472
Coffee?

01:04:05.816 --> 01:04:07.883
This place is amazing.

01:04:11.258 --> 01:04:12.788
Great bike.

01:04:14.262 --> 01:04:15.952
Do you want some...

01:04:18.099 --> 01:04:19.700
coffee?

01:04:19.902 --> 01:04:21.160
Yes, please.

01:04:25.409 --> 01:04:27.236
What have we got?

01:04:27.645 --> 01:04:29.616
We don't have anything.

01:04:29.716 --> 01:04:32.976
We're not chasing it, it's chasing us.

01:04:34.254 --> 01:04:36.184
- Milk?
- Just a drop.

01:04:46.772 --> 01:04:48.132
Don't.

01:04:55.281 --> 01:05:00.079
This thing has really started
to piss me off.

01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:11.131
I think you need a plumber.

01:05:17.644 --> 01:05:19.472
I'll cover you.

01:05:26.557 --> 01:05:30.125
Michelle, what are you doing here?

01:05:34.066 --> 01:05:36.599
In the fridge, I touched it.

01:05:36.837 --> 01:05:38.907
It's all right. It's okay.

01:05:39.007 --> 01:05:41.472
The door was open, so I came in.

01:05:41.676 --> 01:05:45.040
So you're back now.
Everything's going to be fine.

01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:48.575
What happened?

01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:52.619
Foster's mother killed herself.

01:05:54.594 --> 01:05:57.058
- I'm sorry.
- Excuse me.

01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:06.070
Stay there.

01:06:10.647 --> 01:06:13.484
The bite on her shoulder
means he's promised to it.

01:06:13.584 --> 01:06:15.654
- He's got her DNA, too?
- Yeah.

01:06:15.754 --> 01:06:17.148
Harley.

01:06:18.225 --> 01:06:22.090
"Harley." I'm working
with a guy called Harley.

01:06:22.631 --> 01:06:24.799
You think that's funny?

01:06:30.407 --> 01:06:33.042
What's so great about Dick Durkin?

01:06:36.048 --> 01:06:38.149
Go sit in the car.

01:06:38.352 --> 01:06:40.348
Call me on the radio.

01:06:54.235 --> 01:06:58.873
Which hand did you use? This one?

01:07:04.082 --> 01:07:06.342
He's after me now, isn't he?

01:07:07.722 --> 01:07:08.979
No.

01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:13.726
He's getting desperate.

01:07:14.696 --> 01:07:16.421
So am I.

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:20.962
Come.

01:07:40.062 --> 01:07:41.390
Stone.

01:07:45.903 --> 01:07:47.906
Stone here. Come in.

01:07:48.006 --> 01:07:50.209
There's something moving
at the end of the street.

01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:53.714
- What is it?
- I'm just going to investigate.

01:07:53.814 --> 01:07:56.918
I don't know. I'd better take a look.

01:07:58.053 --> 01:07:59.482
One sec.

01:08:11.604 --> 01:08:13.295
Oxford, come in.

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:23.115
Durkin, come in.

01:08:25.254 --> 01:08:26.923
What's wrong?

01:08:27.492 --> 01:08:30.423
I don't know. Durkin's jeep's gone.

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:33.334
I'd better go take a look.

01:08:33.434 --> 01:08:38.340
You stay here on the couch.
Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back.

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:41.904
Something goes wrong, take this.

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:49.749
All right?

01:09:46.462 --> 01:09:48.493
Dick, come in.

01:09:57.878 --> 01:09:59.409
Having fun?

01:10:32.757 --> 01:10:33.947
Harley!

01:10:40.333 --> 01:10:41.797
Durkin!

01:10:51.749 --> 01:10:53.713
Stone!

01:10:54.084 --> 01:10:55.718
Yeah, hang on.

01:10:56.254 --> 01:10:57.684
Got you.

01:10:58.124 --> 01:11:00.452
Get me out of here!

01:11:08.638 --> 01:11:12.864
What happened?
I was looking for you. You okay?

01:11:13.711 --> 01:11:16.346
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Good.

01:11:16.447 --> 01:11:18.308
Didn't even see it.

01:11:19.652 --> 01:11:21.515
What's it done to me?

01:11:22.790 --> 01:11:27.520
I'm going to kill that fucker. I'm going
to find it, and I'm going to kill it.

01:11:51.527 --> 01:11:53.127
Rat bastard!

01:12:17.628 --> 01:12:19.058
Michelle?

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:34.343
What are you doing?

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:37.479
There was a rat, so I shot it.

01:12:38.256 --> 01:12:40.857
You shot my kitchen, that's what.

01:12:41.326 --> 01:12:43.154
I missed the rat.

01:12:44.964 --> 01:12:46.756
What? This one?

01:12:47.668 --> 01:12:48.960
Cool.

01:12:51.806 --> 01:12:53.496
I'm bleeding.

01:12:58.215 --> 01:13:01.819
Come on, pal, wake up. Get back to work.

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:04.385
What? What are you doing?

01:13:06.961 --> 01:13:08.822
What's it done to me?

01:13:10.097 --> 01:13:12.698
See, this is his symbol.

01:13:13.335 --> 01:13:15.902
We've been looking for a meaning.

01:13:16.172 --> 01:13:18.773
What if the symbol is just a map?

01:13:19.543 --> 01:13:20.846
A map?

01:13:20.946 --> 01:13:22.841
Give me that mirror.

01:13:24.007 --> 01:13:26.069
Give me the mirror.

01:13:29.591 --> 01:13:30.883
Fuck!

01:13:31.292 --> 01:13:35.759
There's a circle, a triangle,
a Scorpio sign.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:40.226
- The sting in the tail.
- Let me see.

01:13:40.571 --> 01:13:43.263
The tail points into the River Thames.

01:13:44.042 --> 01:13:45.267
Doesn't make sense.

01:13:48.414 --> 01:13:50.946
It's pointing to Cannon Street.

01:13:51.719 --> 01:13:53.789
That's where Foster was killed.

01:13:53.889 --> 01:13:56.557
It's taking you back.
It's completing the circle.

01:13:57.360 --> 01:14:00.315
If he's there, Michelle's there.

01:14:01.684 --> 01:14:02.852
Geometrically speaking...

01:14:02.952 --> 01:14:05.991
once he kills you,
he's completed his pattern.

01:14:06.091 --> 01:14:08.192
Durkin, come on.

01:14:08.292 --> 01:14:12.164
Cannon Street Station hasn't been used
in years. It got submerged.

01:14:12.264 --> 01:14:15.992
I know a guy who can get us in
who lives here.

01:14:16.404 --> 01:14:18.231
What, is he crazy?

01:14:20.309 --> 01:14:23.241
You'll like him,
he catches rats for a living.

01:14:24.414 --> 01:14:26.138
He missed some.

01:14:26.951 --> 01:14:29.210
Open up! Police!

01:14:32.725 --> 01:14:34.721
Where's the big guy?

01:14:38.132 --> 01:14:40.823
Are there any lights in this place?

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:45.232
- I think we're below the water table.
- I know.

01:14:45.475 --> 01:14:47.905
I just thought I'd mention it.

01:14:50.749 --> 01:14:52.678
Where's your boss?

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:04.801
- Who's the guy?
- What guy?

01:15:04.901 --> 01:15:06.637
You know it's 4:00 in the morning?

01:15:06.737 --> 01:15:10.741
- We want to get to Cannon Street, fast.
- You can't go there. It's closed off.

01:15:10.841 --> 01:15:14.706
- Can you get us down there?
- You're really serious about this.

01:15:16.215 --> 01:15:19.248
- Got any cash?
- No, just credit cards.

01:15:19.586 --> 01:15:21.811
Give me your watch.

01:15:22.857 --> 01:15:25.219
This serious enough for you?

01:15:26.894 --> 01:15:30.260
The exits and entrances
are all blocked off.

01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:34.437
We sent a couple of guys
down there a few years ago.

01:15:34.539 --> 01:15:38.142
- What happened to them?
- They didn't come back, I guess.

01:15:40.079 --> 01:15:41.942
Can you get us in?

01:15:42.217 --> 01:15:45.220
- You don't want to go there.
- Yes, we do.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:47.217
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we do.

01:15:48.425 --> 01:15:50.958
- No, you don't.
- Yes, we do.

01:15:51.462 --> 01:15:54.325
- Boy, are you pushy.
- Give me the watch.

01:15:54.633 --> 01:15:57.996
You're not going to need time
where you're going.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.690
Get it off me.

01:16:21.801 --> 01:16:23.236
I hate rats.

01:16:23.336 --> 01:16:25.733
They love you.

01:16:32.950 --> 01:16:34.549
Strange boy.

01:16:35.052 --> 01:16:37.187
He gets laid every night.

01:16:40.928 --> 01:16:42.730
This is my little door.

01:16:42.830 --> 01:16:45.299
Nobody knows about this, Stone,
except you.

01:16:45.399 --> 01:16:49.128
So don't tell anybody.
This is to my den.

01:16:49.338 --> 01:16:50.903
This is the loo.

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.005
This is it.

01:17:04.624 --> 01:17:07.124
Where does he find these people?

01:17:11.399 --> 01:17:13.227
Hurry up, Durkin.

01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:18.704
We're definitely below
the water table now.

01:17:18.977 --> 01:17:20.770
He's down here.

01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:25.477
This is as far as I go, guys.

01:17:26.087 --> 01:17:28.552
Do we need any of those keys?

01:17:33.162 --> 01:17:34.829
Get the keys.

01:17:35.265 --> 01:17:38.026
- Thanks.
- I wish you well, guys.

01:17:44.578 --> 01:17:45.937
Come on.

01:17:50.385 --> 01:17:54.690
If I were a religious human being,
and not the reasoning person I think I am...

01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:58.228
I wouldn't say this thing
thinks it's Satan, I'd say it is Satan.

01:17:58.328 --> 01:18:00.997
Satan is in deep shit.

01:18:34.943 --> 01:18:37.669
- Do you want a Rah Rah?
- No, come on.

01:18:42.654 --> 01:18:44.583
I hate this place!

01:18:46.393 --> 01:18:48.996
"Master of light,
protect us from this evil plight.

01:18:49.096 --> 01:18:53.368
"For lowly lives, I take my fight,
Black Masque power.

01:18:53.468 --> 01:18:55.000
"The rights of might..."

01:19:09.690 --> 01:19:12.826
Don't do that again. It's not funny.

01:19:23.007 --> 01:19:25.871
It's out here somewhere. I can smell it.

01:19:39.162 --> 01:19:40.829
Is it close?

01:19:41.432 --> 01:19:43.098
It's behind us.

01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:47.261
Elevator.

01:20:08.166 --> 01:20:10.426
We can't kill it.

01:20:12.038 --> 01:20:13.570
I'm here.

01:20:15.243 --> 01:20:18.114
My chest, it's burning.

01:20:18.214 --> 01:20:20.472
Listen.

01:20:23.221 --> 01:20:25.183
Hear the heartbeat?

01:20:27.924 --> 01:20:30.616
It's not yours. You understand?

01:20:34.401 --> 01:20:37.468
Good, so let's go get it.

01:20:38.204 --> 01:20:39.304
Okay.

01:20:58.199 --> 01:21:01.528
Jesus Christ! Harley!

01:21:02.571 --> 01:21:05.901
A circle of light.
It's a circle of light!

01:21:06.243 --> 01:21:07.741
Get me...

01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:13.012
Don't break it! Don't break the surface!

01:21:15.856 --> 01:21:17.421
I'm sorry.

01:21:22.730 --> 01:21:25.297
Okay. Swing.

01:21:29.273 --> 01:21:31.705
- Swing?
- Yeah, swing your legs up.

01:21:33.146 --> 01:21:34.836
Get your legs on the roof.

01:21:45.261 --> 01:21:46.554
Come on.

01:21:52.104 --> 01:21:53.498
Harder!

01:21:53.639 --> 01:21:54.828
Yes!

01:22:10.713 --> 01:22:11.936
Run!

01:23:05.517 --> 01:23:06.911
Foster?

01:23:48.174 --> 01:23:49.864
Get out of there!

01:23:50.043 --> 01:23:51.608
Nice timing!

01:23:58.655 --> 01:24:00.590
- Five seconds.
- Okay.

01:24:00.690 --> 01:24:04.225
Four, three, two...

01:24:20.449 --> 01:24:21.639
Watch this!

01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:29.056
- We haven't been introduced. Dick Durkin.
- What?

01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.992
I'm gonna fry the fucker.

01:24:36.671 --> 01:24:38.271
Shut it off.

01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:41.232
Okay, need a screwdriver.

01:24:41.977 --> 01:24:43.271
Move!

01:24:49.954 --> 01:24:51.520
Gimme some slack.

01:24:57.598 --> 01:24:58.925
Say when.

01:25:03.841 --> 01:25:05.235
Relax, pal.

01:25:08.581 --> 01:25:11.545
Get out of the water now!

01:25:12.251 --> 01:25:14.154
- When!
- Are you sure?

01:25:14.254 --> 01:25:16.719
- What?
- He said, "When."

01:25:22.732 --> 01:25:23.921
Off!

01:25:26.403 --> 01:25:28.435
Please, Durkin!

01:26:46.008 --> 01:26:47.675
Sweet dreams.

01:26:57.723 --> 01:26:59.289
Is it dead?

01:27:00.761 --> 01:27:01.662
Durkin?

01:27:01.762 --> 01:27:05.200
That's a difficult question to answer
with a simple "yes" or "no."

01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:08.298
Philosophy of death is one
of my hobbies. Existentially...

01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:10.540
- Durkin!
- Tell me later.

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.706
I'll tell you later.

01:27:36.858 --> 01:27:39.762
Once again, the Black Masque power
prevails over evil.

01:27:39.862 --> 01:27:43.901
Yes, Detective Dick Durkin
and his psychic sidekick Harley Stone...

01:27:44.001 --> 01:27:45.402
can relax for a moment...

01:27:45.502 --> 01:27:49.711
before they are called forth once more
to do battle with the forces of darkness.

01:27:49.811 --> 01:27:51.813
Durkin?

01:27:51.913 --> 01:27:53.939
Shut up!
