00:42.166 --> 00:44.416
[woman] Your dreams don't just happen.

00:44.916 --> 00:46.583
We make them happen.

And we design them with care just for you.

01:43.083 --> 01:47.500
[sighs] Many leagues have I traveled
across the sea to bring you breakfast.

01:47.583 --> 01:51.291
Oh. Thank you.
Here. Here, let me help you with that.

Dad, why do I have to learn math

03:07.291 --> 03:09.708
if I'm gonna take care
of the lighthouse, like you?

03:10.458 --> 03:13.666
I already know everything there is to know
about the lighthouse anyway.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.625
[majestic music playing]

03:15.708 --> 03:17.208
Answer me this question.

03:18.416 --> 03:20.208
What is a lighthouse for?

03:20.291 --> 03:21.541
To keep ships safe.

03:22.041 --> 03:24.208
[Dad] No. That's not what it's for.

03:25.166 --> 03:27.166
But when you can answer that question…

03:28.541 --> 03:31.041
I'll give you the key to the lighthouse,
and that's a promise.

03:31.125 --> 03:33.708

[clicks tongue] I am 11.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.500
Well, sorry, Pig. It's a rite of passage.

03:46.666 --> 03:47.666
Hmm?

03:49.291 --> 03:50.500
What's that?

03:52.083 --> 03:55.375
Oh, no. No, you don't have to worry.
I'll still be here for you.

03:56.958 --> 03:59.500
All right. Well, good night.

03:59.583 --> 04:00.500
Wait!

04:00.583 --> 04:02.458
-[Dad] Hmm?
-One story?

04:03.125 --> 04:05.000
-Flip story?
-[girl gasps excitedly]

04:05.583 --> 04:06.416
All right.

04:08.708 --> 04:10.208
[Dad exhales]

04:11.458 --> 04:13.208
I got one you never heard before.

04:13.833 --> 04:17.583
As you know, Flip and I,
we lived the outlaw life. Hmm?

04:17.666 --> 04:22.291
Hunting treasure every night,
and… eh, what have you.

04:22.375 --> 04:25.958
Now, one day ol' Flippy comes up to me,
and he says, "Guess what I've heard."

04:26.041 --> 04:27.458
[takes a deep breath]

04:27.541 --> 04:30.958
[quietly] He's heard about these Pearls.
Magic Pearls.

04:31.041 --> 04:34.125
You get one of these Pearls,
and you can wish for whatever you want.

04:34.208 --> 04:37.041
The trouble was
that these Pearls can only be found

04:37.125 --> 04:40.958
in the most dangerous waters
known to mankind.

04:41.041 --> 04:43.375
-[eerie music playing]
-The Sea of Nightmares.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.416
Well, soon as I heard that, I was all,

04:45.500 --> 04:47.583
"Count me out.
I don't want anything to do with it."

04:47.666 --> 04:51.291
Then, of course, Flip, you know him,
he goes and he does… the Double-Knock.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.250
And when your partner
does the Double-Knock--

04:53.333 --> 04:55.166
-You can't refuse.
-[Dad] That's right.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.166
[both] Outlaw Code.

04:56.250 --> 04:58.291
Set sail, we did.

04:59.250 --> 05:02.541
Well, I tell you what, it was cold.
It was mighty cold.

05:03.041 --> 05:04.833
But I was thinking, well,

05:04.916 --> 05:07.958
in that kind of climate,
Flip might not smell so bad.

05:08.041 --> 05:08.916
[girl chuckles]

05:09.000 --> 05:10.666
Then the storm came.

05:11.166 --> 05:12.666
[softly] And the waves.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.666
-Suddenly there was this rumbling sound.
-[thunder rumbles]

05:15.750 --> 05:17.541
-It was all around us.
-[floorboards creak]

05:17.625 --> 05:20.250
-[Dad] And it grew louder by the second.
-[wind picks up]

05:20.333 --> 05:24.250
[Dad] It was the biggest,
deadliest whirlpool I'd ever seen.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.083
That boom swung around,
hit me on the backside,

05:27.166 --> 05:28.958
and tossed me into that water.

05:29.041 --> 05:31.333
And down I went, like a lead weight.

05:31.833 --> 05:34.750
Down… and down,

05:34.833 --> 05:40.000
until I noticed there was a hole
right there in the bottom of the sea.

05:40.791 --> 05:42.041
So I swam in.

05:42.541 --> 05:44.125
What's on the other side?

05:44.750 --> 05:46.166
It's a dead place.

05:46.666 --> 05:48.708
No life of any kind,

05:49.625 --> 05:52.291
just littered with bones
of ancient sea creatures.

05:52.791 --> 05:54.625
That's when it came for me.

05:56.625 --> 05:57.625
The monster.

05:58.916 --> 06:01.250
-It rose up out of the darkness.
-[low growling]

06:01.333 --> 06:05.500
[Dad] Black as night, and bigger
than any creature I had ever seen.

06:05.583 --> 06:08.416
With long, smoky, inky tentacles.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.458
I was frozen in fear.

06:10.541 --> 06:13.708
And it just, kind of slowly…

06:13.791 --> 06:14.791
[rumbling]

06:14.875 --> 06:17.250
-[distorted] …slowly…
-[monster snarls]

06:17.333 --> 06:20.666

for all I was worth! And I take--

-[radio chatter continues]
-Wait, you can't stop now.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.500
What? You mean during the scary part?

06:28.583 --> 06:30.125
-It wasn't scary.
-[Dad] Mm-hmm.

06:30.208 --> 06:33.125
It was a potentially interesting start
to a story.

06:33.208 --> 06:36.083
-[Dad] Go for Peter.
-Potentially… interesting start.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.291
[Peter] Copy.

06:37.375 --> 06:39.958
-[indistinct radio chatter]
-[Peter] Nemo, listen to me.

06:40.041 --> 06:42.000
There's a fishing boat
off Lopez that's in trouble.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.125
It's gonna get bad out there tonight.

06:44.208 --> 06:47.041
Listen, you know what to do
if the power goes out, right?

06:47.125 --> 06:49.125
Fire up the backup generator,

06:49.208 --> 06:51.500
clear the sump pump,
radio Carla if there's a problem.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.208
[giggling] I got it, Dad.

06:55.166 --> 06:57.458

10:22.416 --> 10:24.208
Did he talk with you about any of this?

10:24.708 --> 10:26.166
Her mother died when she was a baby,

10:26.250 --> 10:28.916
so she's used to
a single-parent household.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.166
She doesn't have anybody else.

It's you,
or she becomes a ward of the state.

11:00.375 --> 11:03.583
No. I've never met him before.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.166
Your dad left instructions.

11:11.791 --> 11:13.500
If anything ever happened to him…

11:15.500 --> 11:18.125
he wanted you to go
and stay with your uncle in the city.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.750

Nemo, you can't live alone.

-Uh, no shoes on the carpet.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.833
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-No…

13:14.708 --> 13:15.875
It's a great building.

13:16.666 --> 13:18.375
You never have to leave. [chuckles]

13:18.875 --> 13:21.750
Which I basically never do
'cause I work from home.

13:23.375 --> 13:24.375
Sorry.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.541
There's a dry cleaner's, a coffee shop.

13:28.625 --> 13:31.541
They even have
a, um… a spinning studio downstairs.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.208
Are you into spinning?

13:33.791 --> 13:34.916
Like spinning around?

13:35.541 --> 13:37.458
I don't know. I… I've never tried it.

13:40.166 --> 13:41.166
Hey… [spluttering]

13:42.333 --> 13:43.875
Do you like doorknobs?

13:47.333 --> 13:48.458
Ta-da!

13:50.333 --> 13:53.166
These are my babies.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.541
You're a doorknob salesman?

13:55.625 --> 13:58.125
[scoffs] I'm not…
I'm not a doorknob salesman.

13:58.208 --> 14:01.125
I own a company that sells doorknobs.

14:01.208 --> 14:03.500
We sell latches. We sell escutcheons.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.166
Here's where we differ.

14:05.250 --> 14:10.250
A lot of the glamour boys in the industry,
they chase the latest trends, not us.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.708
No, thank you.
We'll stick with the classics.

14:12.791 --> 14:15.208
'Cause it's security. It's not fashion.

14:15.291 --> 14:17.166
-Don't touch that.
-Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.166
That's not a toy.

14:20.875 --> 14:23.208
This is an antique.

14:24.458 --> 14:27.541
Came from a prison cell in Alcatraz.

14:28.041 --> 14:30.666
In case I need to lock you
in your room. [chuckles]

14:32.416 --> 14:34.875
I-- I-- I'm not gonna lock you
in your room.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.041

[wistful piano music playing]

14:50.833 --> 14:53.916
[splutters] Do you need a hug or whatever?

14:56.000 --> 14:57.000
No.

Well, good night.

I'm just one of those weird things

-[grunts]
-[chair legs strain]

20:28.791 --> 20:30.500
What are you doing here?

20:31.083 --> 20:32.333
And where's my dad?

20:33.041 --> 20:36.000
[scoffs] Nobody told you?

20:36.083 --> 20:37.708
I know what happened.

20:38.625 --> 20:43.208
[sighs, grunts] Well, your dad
and I were partners a long time ago,

20:43.291 --> 20:44.833
before he went straight and had a kid.

20:45.333 --> 20:48.791
Big mistake, in my opinion.
[chuckles slightly, sighs deeply]

20:50.083 --> 20:52.916
[snarling] Mad, bad,
and dangerous to know.

20:54.000 --> 20:54.958
Named Flip.

20:55.041 --> 20:57.750
-You're Flip?
-[grunts softly] Yeah.

20:57.833 --> 20:59.625
I thought you were something
my dad made up,

20:59.708 --> 21:01.458
and you're different than I imagined.

21:01.541 --> 21:02.708
Handsomer?

21:02.791 --> 21:05.833
More "gorgeous-er," if you will?

21:05.916 --> 21:06.958
Hairier.

21:07.541 --> 21:10.041
-And… [sniffs] …smellier.
-[Flip] Hmm.

21:10.125 --> 21:11.791
I mean, I know you're not real,

21:11.875 --> 21:15.125
but I always pictured,
like, a normal human being.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.375
Okay, you just said
like four insulting things

21:17.458 --> 21:18.625
on top of each other.

21:18.708 --> 21:19.625
Rude.

21:27.375 --> 21:28.458
[Pig squeals]

21:28.541 --> 21:30.500
By ripping my dad's room apart?

21:32.083 --> 21:34.125
Oh, that reminds me…

21:34.708 --> 21:37.083
[chuckling] …your dad, he had a map.

21:37.583 --> 21:40.625
About this big.
Weird shapes and lines all over it.

21:41.291 --> 21:43.458
Picture with an oyster
with a pearl on the back of it.

21:43.541 --> 21:46.666
It's one-of-a-kind, kid.
We risked our lives stealing it.

21:46.750 --> 21:49.500
-I never saw any map like that.
-[Flip] Don't lie to me, kid!

21:49.583 --> 21:52.041
[growling, breathing shakily]

21:53.375 --> 21:55.125
Your dad would want me to have it.

21:55.208 --> 21:57.291
[Pig squealing]

21:58.750 --> 21:59.750
I'm not lying.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.333
Never mind, I'll find it myself.
[blows a raspberry]

22:04.541 --> 22:08.833
Hey, you can't just bust in here
like some kind of thief.

22:08.916 --> 22:11.625
-You say thief like it's a bad thing.
-[glass shatters]

22:11.708 --> 22:13.833
A thief just takes things
that don't belong to them.

22:13.916 --> 22:15.875
You can't take things
from other people's dreams.

22:15.958 --> 22:18.208
[scoffs] Sure you can.

22:18.708 --> 22:20.666
Ya just gotta know
how to get in and get out.

22:21.166 --> 22:22.000
I'm in your dream.

22:22.083 --> 22:23.958
You're just a figment of my imagination.

22:24.041 --> 22:27.083
[Flip splutters, scoffing]

22:28.500 --> 22:31.375
You wish you could dream up
somethin' this good. Look at that.

22:31.458 --> 22:33.291
Mm! I look good.

22:34.833 --> 22:37.041
Please! I don't want you here.

22:37.791 --> 22:39.083
I just want my dad.

22:40.291 --> 22:41.791
[clicks tongue] Oh.

22:42.708 --> 22:44.666
[smacks lips] Okay.

22:45.166 --> 22:48.916
What if there is a way
you can see your dad again?

22:49.500 --> 22:50.416
What do you mean?

22:50.500 --> 22:55.916
I'm goin' on a little treasure hunt,
and this treasure… is magic.

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
Lets you wish
for whatever you want here in Slumberland.

22:59.083 --> 23:00.500
I could see my dad again.

23:00.583 --> 23:05.750
Oh, yeah, you can see your dad again.
Right here, every night.

23:08.916 --> 23:11.041
But I'm gonna need that map, kid.

23:11.125 --> 23:14.916
-[tense music playing]
-I don't know what you're talking about.

23:16.833 --> 23:19.333
[sucks teeth] Yeah, I believe you.

23:19.416 --> 23:22.458
Hey, wait! I can try to find the map.
I can still come with you.

23:22.541 --> 23:24.000
Oh, that sounds super fun.

23:24.083 --> 23:26.208
Except you got no gear, no skills,

23:26.291 --> 23:29.125
and without the map…
oh, you're useless to me.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.416
-[Nemo gasps]
-Time to wake up, kid.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.791

-[Pig squeals]

23:33.875 --> 23:36.541

A map.

[objects rustling]

[door handle rattles, squeaks]

23:54.291 --> 23:56.500
Oh, you're up already. Good.

23:57.291 --> 23:58.333
What are you doin'?

23:58.416 --> 24:00.833
What's the weirdest dream you've ever had?

24:00.916 --> 24:02.791
I don't remember my dreams.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.041
Don't actually think I have any.

24:06.125 --> 24:08.375
I brought you some milk, right?

24:09.625 --> 24:12.916
Are you, uh, excited
for your first day of school?

24:13.875 --> 24:15.041
School?

24:15.125 --> 24:18.208
-[school bell rings]
-[indistinct chatter]

24:18.291 --> 24:21.416
[Uncle] This place should be amazing.
It costs a fortune.

24:21.916 --> 24:24.208
My dad said schools are basically prisons.

24:24.291 --> 24:26.916
They keep kids locked up
physically and mentally,

24:27.000 --> 24:29.166
prepare them for jobs
that are also basically prisons,

24:29.250 --> 24:31.500
until they retire
and go to a nursing home.

24:31.583 --> 24:32.541
Their final prison.

24:33.208 --> 24:34.791
School is not a prison.

24:34.875 --> 24:36.708
Can I leave whenever I want to?

24:37.833 --> 24:39.291
It's a little like a prison.

24:39.375 --> 24:40.833
[school bell rings]

24:40.916 --> 24:42.083
Bell doesn't help.

24:43.416 --> 24:44.958
Nemo, hi.

24:45.041 --> 24:46.708
Welcome to Westbrook.

24:46.791 --> 24:49.166
-I am Ms. Arya, lower school counselor.
-Hey.

24:49.250 --> 24:50.083
Hi.

24:50.916 --> 24:54.583
Well, I know
what a… a difficult time this is but, um…

24:54.666 --> 24:57.250
Hey, do you know
what the most resilient thing on earth is?

24:57.333 --> 24:58.333
It's not titanium.

24:58.416 --> 25:01.000
Is it tungsten?
It has a higher tensile strength--

25:01.083 --> 25:01.916
The human spirit.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.416
Oh, you mean metaphorically.

25:06.500 --> 25:09.083
What you're going through, it's hard.
But you know what?

25:09.166 --> 25:10.958
You are stronger than you know.

25:11.458 --> 25:12.958
Hey, can we talk for a sec?

25:13.041 --> 25:14.875
-Oh, yeah.
-Just one sec. Uh…

25:15.541 --> 25:18.375
I, uh, just wanted to prepare you.

25:18.916 --> 25:22.166
[quietly] Nemo's dad
kinda raised her like a hermit.

25:22.666 --> 25:26.541
Not in a bad way, just…
you have your work cut out for you.

25:26.625 --> 25:28.875
She… She's gonna need
a lot of emotional support.

25:28.958 --> 25:33.458
Yeah. I mean, I'm hoping
that you guys can help with all that.

25:33.541 --> 25:35.583
Oh. Well, we can't do that
all by ourselves.

25:35.666 --> 25:37.416
-No.
-[both chuckle]

25:37.500 --> 25:39.333
-Right?
-Right. Obviously.

25:39.875 --> 25:41.375
Is that not something you do?

25:42.375 --> 25:46.000
Look, I don't know how to take care
of a little kid or talk about feelings.

25:46.083 --> 25:49.083
Now, I think that she would be better off
literally anywhere else.

25:49.166 --> 25:50.208
[softly] Okay.

25:50.291 --> 25:51.625
Oh, you have my hands.

25:51.708 --> 25:52.708
Oy.

25:53.208 --> 25:55.625
You are capable of more than you think.

25:55.708 --> 25:56.958
[Uncle] Mm-hmm.

25:57.041 --> 25:59.958
-[chuckles] Truly. You just gotta…
-[chuckles lightly]

26:00.041 --> 26:02.250
You just gotta connect
with a part of yourself

26:02.333 --> 26:04.000
that you're not used to accessing.

26:04.083 --> 26:04.916
Right.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.125
You just gotta connect with her.

26:07.208 --> 26:09.291
-Just try.
-Okay.

26:10.625 --> 26:12.791
-[door opens]
-Hi, everyone. Hi.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.333
[quietly] Thanks, Ms. Young.

26:14.416 --> 26:16.625
Hi, guys. How's everybody doing?

26:16.708 --> 26:20.291
This is Nemo.
She's gonna be joining your class.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.625
So if you could all
just make her feel right at home,

26:22.708 --> 26:24.041
I would be so grateful.

26:24.125 --> 26:24.958
[door opens]

26:25.041 --> 26:26.083
Sorry.

26:27.458 --> 26:28.666
Okay, everyone. Listen up.

26:28.750 --> 26:29.750
[tuba case clatters]

26:29.833 --> 26:31.416
In a victory for planet Earth,

26:32.208 --> 26:34.333
we got compostable utensils
in the cafeteria.

26:34.416 --> 26:35.541
Oh.

26:35.625 --> 26:36.666
We won!

26:37.666 --> 26:39.625
Hmm. Uh, Nemo, Jamal.

26:39.708 --> 26:41.750
-Jamal, Nemo.
-[Jamal] It's a seven-day cycle.

26:41.833 --> 26:43.791
You're late, you get a blue dot.

26:43.875 --> 26:47.208
Three blues, and you get a red dot,
and your parents get a notification.

26:47.291 --> 26:48.958
And you can get the app for your phone.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.541
I don't have a phone.

26:52.375 --> 26:54.250
That is refreshing.

26:54.750 --> 26:56.625
You're gonna need the app, though.

26:57.125 --> 26:58.333
Any clubs you're into?

26:58.416 --> 27:01.208
I'm on recycling team,
Model UN, ceramics club,

27:01.291 --> 27:03.458
Pop-Tarts, that's our improv group,

27:03.541 --> 27:07.416
lawn bowling, Slavic chorus,
orchestra, woodworking, ultimate Frisbee…

27:07.500 --> 27:09.166
Where'd you go to school before this?

27:09.250 --> 27:11.291
I didn't. I was homeschooled.

27:11.791 --> 27:14.250
Um, my dad and I lived in a lighthouse.

27:14.333 --> 27:17.083
A lighthouse? That sounds awesome.

27:17.583 --> 27:18.875
Why'd you move here?

27:20.458 --> 27:21.458
My…

27:22.875 --> 27:24.875
My dad's on a trip. That's why I'm here.

27:24.958 --> 27:27.125
I'm staying with my uncle,
just temporarily.

27:27.208 --> 27:29.083
Oh. Cool.

27:30.666 --> 27:32.208
[groans]

27:32.291 --> 27:34.166
[both groan]

27:34.250 --> 27:35.500
Those are my Undeadheads.

27:35.583 --> 27:38.208
We dress up as zombies
and watch zombie movies.

27:38.291 --> 27:40.958
It's cooler than it sounds… I think.

27:41.666 --> 27:42.958
Uh, come sit with us.

27:43.458 --> 27:45.250
Um, I… I need to do my math.

27:46.250 --> 27:47.583
[Jamal] Okay.

27:52.166 --> 27:56.041
I have a great activity
we can do together.

27:56.625 --> 27:57.625
Lockpicks.

27:57.708 --> 28:00.333
Probably from some master thief.

28:00.416 --> 28:02.250
Or maybe just a retiring locksmith.

28:07.125 --> 28:08.125
That cool?

28:09.500 --> 28:12.750
I first learned to do this
when I was about your age.

28:13.291 --> 28:16.916
I was the first kid in school
interested in door hardware.

28:17.416 --> 28:18.333
[lock clicking]

28:18.416 --> 28:22.250
[Uncle] Now, the trick…
is to move both slowly.

28:23.041 --> 28:24.291
Feel for the catch.

28:25.416 --> 28:27.000
Before you know it…

28:27.083 --> 28:28.166
[lock clangs]

28:28.666 --> 28:31.750
Houdini who?
Houdini me. That's Houdini who.

28:32.958 --> 28:37.208
That's a little… mantra.
You don't have to say that.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.208
Wanna have a go?

28:40.583 --> 28:42.083
I'm a little doorknobbed out.

28:42.166 --> 28:45.291
That's fine. We can, um… [clicks tongue]

28:45.375 --> 28:47.166
We'll do something else. We'll, uh…

28:49.666 --> 28:50.833
play soccer.

28:52.250 --> 28:56.083
We could play soccer.
Wanna… uh, build a pillow fort?

28:56.166 --> 28:58.083
Are you reading a list off your phone?

28:58.166 --> 29:00.958
-Yes. Yes, I am.
-[phone locks]

29:01.708 --> 29:03.000
I'm gonna just…

29:03.083 --> 29:05.416
Oh, sure. Totally.

29:07.375 --> 29:10.083
[objects rustling]

29:10.166 --> 29:13.291
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

29:14.875 --> 29:16.875
[Pig grunting wildly]

29:21.500 --> 29:22.666
Pig?

29:25.291 --> 29:26.416
Pig, what are you doing?

29:26.500 --> 29:29.041
[Pig grunting, snorting]

29:34.541 --> 29:35.875
[Pig oinks]

29:36.625 --> 29:37.666
[Nemo gasps]

29:37.750 --> 29:38.958
[Nemo inhales]

29:57.541 --> 29:59.416
[Nemo] Oh my gosh, Pig.

30:00.666 --> 30:01.708
You found it.

30:07.750 --> 30:09.666
Come on, Pig. Let's go find Dad.

30:16.583 --> 30:19.125
Boring book, boring book, boring…

30:30.875 --> 30:32.250
[music swells, fades]

30:32.333 --> 30:34.375
[students chattering]

30:34.458 --> 30:35.333
See ya.

30:36.166 --> 30:39.041
Um, I have to check my schedule.
Can I see your phone?

30:39.541 --> 30:40.916
Uh, yeah.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.083
[boy] Wait up!

30:45.125 --> 30:49.416
[Uncle] Look at you, using apps.
See what happens when you try?

30:49.500 --> 30:52.291
[Nemo] Yup, just learnin' new stuff
all the time.

30:52.375 --> 30:54.916
[tense music playing]

31:07.666 --> 31:09.666
[machinery humming]

31:13.833 --> 31:15.750
[steam hissing]

31:25.750 --> 31:26.750
[Nemo grunts]

31:50.708 --> 31:52.166
[tense music fades]

31:53.375 --> 31:55.500
[birds chirping]

31:55.583 --> 31:57.041
[wings flapping]

32:10.041 --> 32:12.041
[Pig and small buffalo grunting]

32:14.708 --> 32:16.083
[Nemo] Oh, Flip.

32:17.291 --> 32:18.291
Come on, Pig.

32:19.541 --> 32:20.541
[echoing] Flip?

32:20.625 --> 32:23.166
[banging and rustling in tower]

32:26.750 --> 32:27.750
Flip?

32:29.708 --> 32:32.000
-[Pig grunting]
-[Nemo] Flip?

32:32.083 --> 32:34.500
-[metal clanging]
-[Flip laughing]

32:34.583 --> 32:36.541
-[Nemo] Flip!
-[tool clatters]

32:36.625 --> 32:37.708
[Flip] You.

32:37.791 --> 32:38.791
I found the map.

32:38.875 --> 32:41.333
I knew I liked you. [chuckles]

32:42.375 --> 32:45.041
-You tried to kill me.
-I was trying to wake you up.

32:45.125 --> 32:47.166
Everybody knows
you can't die in your dreams.

32:48.583 --> 32:52.250
You told me about this in my dream,
and then I find it in the Waking World.

32:52.333 --> 32:53.583
How is that possible?

32:53.666 --> 32:56.708
[clicks tongue] Maybe the real world's
bigger than you thought.

32:57.333 --> 32:58.166
[laughs]

32:58.250 --> 32:59.625
[breeze blowing]

32:59.708 --> 33:02.125
[Nemo] Hey! It's my map.
You can't just take it.

33:02.208 --> 33:04.208
Yeah, well,
I hate to break it to you, kid.

33:04.291 --> 33:06.125
Taking people's stuff's kind of my thing.

33:07.166 --> 33:08.166
[rock clatters]

33:08.250 --> 33:10.791
-[Flip gasps]
-You said I could see my dad again.

33:10.875 --> 33:11.916
I'm coming with you.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.541
Listen, that's real sweet and all,
and I miss your dad too,

33:14.625 --> 33:16.250
but you're not comin'! Go away.

33:18.041 --> 33:19.083
[knocks twice]

33:21.458 --> 33:22.708
[Flip gasps]

33:24.000 --> 33:25.000
What was that?

33:25.083 --> 33:26.500
Double-Knock.

33:26.583 --> 33:28.625
He told you about the Double-Knock?

33:28.708 --> 33:31.125
You have to take me. Outlaw Code.

33:31.208 --> 33:33.250
Oh, don't tell me about the Outlaw Code.

33:33.333 --> 33:35.125
I'm one of the cocreators
of the Outlaw Code.

33:35.208 --> 33:37.041
Before me, it was just one knock.

33:37.125 --> 33:40.458
This isn't some Girl Scout trip
to Lollipop Land, okay?

33:40.541 --> 33:43.583
We're gonna have to travel through
people's dreams to get to that treasure.

33:43.666 --> 33:45.750
So you get killed, it's on you.

33:46.250 --> 33:47.791
You said you can't die in a dream.

33:47.875 --> 33:50.708
I said you can't die in your dream.
You die in your dream, you wake up.

33:50.791 --> 33:53.083
You die in someone else's dream,
you don't wake up. Ever.

33:53.791 --> 33:55.833
I don't care. I'm coming.

33:56.583 --> 33:57.625
Fine.

33:58.333 --> 34:02.375
You slow me down, you screw things up,
this map is mine, and you're on your own.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.250
-Deal.
-Let me see your gear.

34:06.208 --> 34:07.666
[under breath] Double-Knock.

34:09.125 --> 34:12.541
What is this? Extraordinary Knobs.

34:12.625 --> 34:14.916
It's my Uncle Philip's.
He's a doorknob salesman.

34:15.000 --> 34:18.250
He has no friends, no life,
and he makes me go to school.

34:18.333 --> 34:19.250
What a monster.

34:19.333 --> 34:22.166
Well, this'll put you to sleep
faster than any sleeping pill.

34:22.250 --> 34:25.500
Okay, here. You hold on to this
when you fall asleep.

34:25.583 --> 34:28.166
That way, you can find me
when we're on the road. Okay?

34:28.250 --> 34:31.708
[Pig choking]

34:31.791 --> 34:32.791
[Nemo grunts]

34:33.708 --> 34:35.708
-[Pig burps]
-What the heck is that?

34:36.208 --> 34:38.208
[Nemo] He's a pig, and his name is Pig.

34:38.291 --> 34:41.041
Super creative. Fine.
Bring him. I love bacon.

34:42.125 --> 34:45.041
All right. Look at this.

34:45.125 --> 34:47.208
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

34:47.291 --> 34:49.041
The World of Dreams.

34:50.250 --> 34:54.541
This is a map of every dream
in the world. Slumberland.

34:55.041 --> 34:58.666
Your dad and I used this map to go
on all our adventures back in the day,

34:58.750 --> 35:01.875
jumpin' from dream to dream,
to wherever we wanted to go.

35:02.375 --> 35:05.083
We swiped this map
from a dream cop at the Bureau.

35:05.166 --> 35:06.958
She's been chasing me ever since.

35:07.041 --> 35:08.333
The Bureau?

35:08.416 --> 35:11.125
Bureau of Subconscious Activities, BOSA.

35:11.208 --> 35:15.000
Unfortunately for us, they're the bozos
that decide what you get to dream.

35:15.083 --> 35:16.833
Unless you end up here.

35:17.791 --> 35:19.416
-The Sea of Nightmares.
-[thunder crashing]

35:20.083 --> 35:23.083
Sea of Nightmares.
My dad told me about that.

35:24.583 --> 35:26.125
That's where the Pearls are.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.583
[Flip] Greatest treasure in the world.

35:28.666 --> 35:31.041
The sticky part
is those dream cops at the Bureau

35:31.125 --> 35:33.250
don't want us to know they even exist.

35:33.333 --> 35:35.416
Because you get your hands
on one of those bad boys,

35:35.500 --> 35:38.375
and you can wish
for whatever you want here in Slumberland.

35:38.458 --> 35:39.833
And it's out of their control.

35:41.250 --> 35:42.541
I could see my dad again?

35:43.333 --> 35:45.333
If you don't die. Which you probably will.

35:45.833 --> 35:48.208
Oh my God. Your dad would kill me
if he knew I was doing this.

35:48.833 --> 35:51.583
All right, listen,
we're looking for reoccurring dreams.

35:51.666 --> 35:54.000
That way, we can get out
the same way that we got in.

35:54.083 --> 35:55.458
Where's the door?

35:55.541 --> 35:56.500
What door?

35:56.583 --> 35:59.916
[sighs] The Bureau puts in secret doors
to connect the dreams.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.833
Civilians aren't supposed to know,
unless you're a genius like myself.

36:02.916 --> 36:03.916
Hi-yah!

36:04.000 --> 36:06.583
[martial arts shout] Look out!

36:06.666 --> 36:08.208
[music swells, fades]

36:08.291 --> 36:10.916
Okay, that was definitely not here before.

36:11.000 --> 36:14.083
All right, we go through this door,
everything changes.

36:14.166 --> 36:16.583
You slip up, you're dead.

36:16.666 --> 36:18.666
You'll never see the Waking World again.

36:20.625 --> 36:22.666
Okay. [takes a deep breath]

36:22.750 --> 36:23.958
What are we waiting for?

36:24.458 --> 36:25.583
That's the spirit.

36:27.333 --> 36:30.916
All right. Welcome to my world, kid.

36:31.000 --> 36:33.250
Brand-new dream, still under construction.

36:33.333 --> 36:36.041
-[orchestral music swells]
-[butterfly wings flapping]

36:37.541 --> 36:39.000
[Flip] Ooh.

36:39.083 --> 36:40.166
Elegante.

36:41.000 --> 36:43.125
Spanish for "I look good."

36:44.250 --> 36:46.875
I'm a flippin' outlaw,
so I don't play by the rules.

36:46.958 --> 36:48.000
But here's the rules.

36:48.083 --> 36:50.583
Rule number one, keep a low profile.

36:50.666 --> 36:53.833
We don't wanna get caught messin' around
in other people's dreams, trust me.

36:54.500 --> 36:56.750
-If the dream pigs catch you, they will--
-[Pig grunts]

36:56.833 --> 36:58.916
Oh. My bad, buddy.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.500
If the dream cops catch you,

37:00.583 --> 37:02.541
they will lock you up
and throw away the key.

37:02.625 --> 37:04.708
Doomed to rot
in a dingy Bureau prison cell

37:04.791 --> 37:07.625
for all of eternity
till you cease to exist entirely.

37:08.166 --> 37:09.750
So blend in.

37:09.833 --> 37:11.166
Yeah, 'cause you totally blend in.

37:11.250 --> 37:13.458
Rule number two, stay focused.

37:13.541 --> 37:15.875
[whistles] We're not here
to have fun, okay?

37:15.958 --> 37:18.541
We get in,
we find the next door, then we get out.

37:18.625 --> 37:19.791
Onto the next dream.

37:19.875 --> 37:22.375
Our one and only mission
is finding those Pearls.

37:22.458 --> 37:25.333
Rule number three.
We're not friends. We're not partners.

37:25.416 --> 37:27.625
I am the boss. El Jefe, 'kay?

37:27.708 --> 37:29.166
We do as I say, you got it?

37:29.250 --> 37:32.250
So rule number three's
just a bunch of aggressive statements?

37:33.000 --> 37:34.666
Nobody likes a smart aleck, kid.

37:35.875 --> 37:39.166
-[in Spanish] Excuse me.
-[Flip] Hey, buddy. What's up?

37:39.250 --> 37:41.708
Are you sure you're in the right dream?

37:41.791 --> 37:42.916
[Flip] Ooh.

37:43.708 --> 37:45.208
I don't see you on my list.

37:45.291 --> 37:46.333
[Flip] Mmm.

37:46.916 --> 37:49.541
The girl represents long-lost childhood.

37:50.166 --> 37:54.125
I'm a troubling mix of a father figure

37:54.208 --> 37:56.333
and raw, masculine power.

37:56.416 --> 37:59.125
[manager clears throat, clicks tongue] Uh…

37:59.208 --> 38:00.500
And… what is this?

38:01.708 --> 38:03.250
[Pig belches]

38:03.875 --> 38:04.708
Brother…

38:04.791 --> 38:05.666
[chuckles]

38:05.750 --> 38:09.125
[in English, with Spanish accent]
…sometimes a pig is just a pig.

38:09.208 --> 38:10.875
Silly puerco.

38:11.375 --> 38:13.333
-[Flip oinks]
-[both chuckle]

38:13.416 --> 38:14.333
Yes.

38:15.416 --> 38:16.750
[in Spanish] Library.

38:16.833 --> 38:18.958
[clears throat] Perdón.

38:19.041 --> 38:20.166
Uh…

38:20.250 --> 38:21.500
Do you party?

38:21.583 --> 38:22.916
No, I don't.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.125
You party. I party.

38:25.208 --> 38:26.208
[mutters] Okay.

38:26.291 --> 38:27.708
-Gracias.
-Okay.

38:27.791 --> 38:28.916
[in English] What was that?

38:29.000 --> 38:30.916
I don't know Spanish.
That's the only word I know.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.666
Leave it to the pros.
That's me. That's professional.

38:33.750 --> 38:36.500
Ooh, it's all about the Miss D,
misdirection.

38:36.583 --> 38:37.833
Did you know that? Boop!

38:37.916 --> 38:39.916
I don't even know if this is real.
Oh, that's real.

38:42.375 --> 38:43.666
[salsa music playing]

38:43.750 --> 38:45.541
[dancers cheering]

38:45.625 --> 38:48.250
Now we're talkin'. [laughs]

38:48.333 --> 38:50.750
Who wants the Waking World
when you got all this, huh?

39:13.666 --> 39:17.541

This the thieving punk you rang about?

39:17.625 --> 39:19.166
[ominous music playing]

39:19.250 --> 39:20.333
[Green] Cheers, mate.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.125

39:35.416 --> 39:37.625
is behind the stage, yeah. [chuckles]

39:37.708 --> 39:41.875
[band leader, in Spanish] And now,
the Salsa Queen of Old Havana!

39:41.958 --> 39:43.833

-[crowd cheering her on in Spanish]
-[salsa beat playing]

39:53.833 --> 39:55.291
[in English] There's our dreamer.

39:55.375 --> 39:59.000
-[laughs] Classic repression dream.
-[Nemo] What's that?

39:59.083 --> 40:02.000
Well, you never heard of Freud?
[in singsong] Repression.

40:02.083 --> 40:06.625
All those feelings get bottled up,
and they go busting out in Slumberland.

40:06.708 --> 40:09.583
I guarantee she's nothin' like that
in the Waking World.

40:09.666 --> 40:10.583
Believe me.

40:12.541 --> 40:13.541
[woman cheering]

40:14.125 --> 40:16.541
[in Spanish accent] You see me? Yes.

40:16.625 --> 40:18.000
-Hi-yah!
-[Nemo yelps]

40:18.083 --> 40:20.625
["Aguanile" playing]

40:20.708 --> 40:22.625
[in Spanish] Mm! What is that scent?

40:23.125 --> 40:24.750
Mm. [sniffs]

40:25.250 --> 40:27.208
[in English] It's au naturel. By Flip.

40:27.291 --> 40:30.500
[sighs, in Spanish]
Such raw, masculine power.

40:30.583 --> 40:31.416
Gracias.

40:31.500 --> 40:35.916
But at the same time… a deep sadness.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.291
Like a lost little boy, far from home.

40:39.125 --> 40:40.000
Huh?

40:40.083 --> 40:41.833
[sighs] Dance with me.

40:42.458 --> 40:43.291
[in English] Hey!

40:43.375 --> 40:45.333
You said we weren't here to have fun.

40:46.041 --> 40:49.208
I said you're not here to have fun.
I'm an outlaw.

40:49.291 --> 40:51.458
If I'm not havin' fun,
I'm doin' my job wrong.

40:51.541 --> 40:52.708
-Know what I'm sayin'?
-Hmm.

40:52.791 --> 40:53.708
[in Spanish] Who's she?

40:54.625 --> 40:57.208
Go away, Nemo.
You'll ruin the nice lady's dream.

40:57.291 --> 40:59.125
-Buh-bye.
-[Nemo grunts]

40:59.208 --> 41:01.791

[glass tinkling]

42:07.666 --> 42:09.041
Oh…

42:10.416 --> 42:11.583
That's no bueno.

42:11.666 --> 42:13.750
Adiós. Let's get to that door, fast.

42:14.375 --> 42:16.166
-Oh!
-[gun charging]

42:16.250 --> 42:18.208
Hello, Flip. Where's that map?

42:18.291 --> 42:19.333
[snarls] Green.

42:19.416 --> 42:22.666
I've been waiting
for this for a long time.

42:23.291 --> 42:24.333
The dream cop.

42:24.416 --> 42:26.541
You're under a--

42:26.625 --> 42:28.541
[ceiling creaking]

42:28.625 --> 42:30.625
[shakily] What… the…?

42:30.708 --> 42:32.125
"What the…?" [chuckles]

42:32.208 --> 42:34.291
-[high-pitched] Aww!

Ew, yucky!

43:18.208 --> 43:20.875
-[music fades]
-[Flip] Holy moly.

43:20.958 --> 43:24.375
It took years for me
to shake that cop off my tuchus.

43:24.458 --> 43:26.000
[Pig snorting softly]

43:26.083 --> 43:29.666
First dream out with you,
I get her and a nightmare?

43:29.750 --> 43:31.208
You're like a bad luck charm.

43:31.291 --> 43:32.208
And I don't get it.

43:32.291 --> 43:34.583
That nightmare
flew right past the dreamer.

43:34.666 --> 43:36.583
[sighs] Why the heck
was it coming after us?

43:36.666 --> 43:38.083
I've seen it before.

43:38.166 --> 43:40.250
[somber music playing]

43:40.333 --> 43:41.833
The night my dad died.

43:41.916 --> 43:44.708
It's yours. It's your nightmare.

43:45.250 --> 43:46.083
What?

43:46.166 --> 43:49.041
You brought the nightmare.
Nightmares smell fear.

43:49.916 --> 43:53.791
It's tracking you, and nightmares
won't stop until they get you.

43:53.875 --> 43:56.291
[panting] Do you ruin
every party you go to?

43:56.375 --> 43:57.625
I've never even been to a party.

43:57.708 --> 43:59.833
I never should've brought you.
Give me the map back.

43:59.916 --> 44:01.791
No. I did the Double-Knock.

44:01.875 --> 44:02.916
Give it to me!

[smoke billows]

44:08.500 --> 44:10.958
No, no, no. Don't--
Don't wake up! Don't wake up!

-Uh, what are you doing here?

44:24.083 --> 44:25.458
[cart's wheels squeak]

44:25.541 --> 44:27.333
Checking my mushrooms.

44:27.416 --> 44:30.541
Mushroom club. It's a… one-person club.

44:32.458 --> 44:34.458
Are you hiding out down here?

44:34.541 --> 44:35.666
No.

44:35.750 --> 44:37.500
'Cause I mean, you weren't in class,

44:37.583 --> 44:40.875
and this looks a little bit
like a secret hideout, so…

44:41.458 --> 44:45.375
School thinks I'm on a trip,
and my uncle thinks I'm at school.

44:46.166 --> 44:47.208
Hardcore.

44:47.291 --> 44:50.333
Uh, you won't tell anybody
I'm here, though, right?

44:50.416 --> 44:52.708
Omertà, the vow of silence.

44:53.375 --> 44:54.750
You can try some of my mushrooms.

44:54.833 --> 44:56.625
Just brush 'em off first. It's manure.

44:56.708 --> 44:58.833
It's not my poop,
so it isn't weird or anything.

44:58.916 --> 44:59.750
Bye.

45:00.708 --> 45:01.958
See ya. [sighs]

45:02.041 --> 45:03.208
[indistinct chatter]

45:03.291 --> 45:04.750
Hey… [sighs]

45:05.375 --> 45:06.625
…squirt. [chuckles]

45:07.125 --> 45:09.625
Can I take the…
I wanna show you something really cool.

45:11.000 --> 45:11.875
You ready?

45:11.958 --> 45:13.041
[Nemo] Mm-hmm.

45:13.125 --> 45:15.000
And… surprise.

45:16.583 --> 45:18.333
I arranged with Carla to get it here,

45:18.416 --> 45:21.458
and I figured
maybe this Saturday we could go sailing.

45:21.541 --> 45:23.166
I mean, you could go sailing.

45:23.250 --> 45:28.125
I'm strictly a dry-land guy
due to my sensitive bowels.

45:30.375 --> 45:32.416
You should sell it or something.

45:32.500 --> 45:34.500
[wistful piano music playing]

45:36.000 --> 45:37.791
I don't think I wanna sail anymore.

45:43.166 --> 45:44.583
[Philip] Nemo, I know this is hard.

45:45.583 --> 45:47.666
And different and scary.

45:48.875 --> 45:52.583
But I think it would be a mistake
if you shut yourself off from the world,

45:52.666 --> 45:53.958
like your dad did.

45:55.791 --> 45:57.208
What are you talking about?

45:58.500 --> 46:01.583
Your dad was… different before.

46:03.041 --> 46:04.625
And then, when your mom died--

46:04.708 --> 46:06.125
My dad wasn't shut off.

46:06.208 --> 46:08.833
[scoffs] Nemo, he moved to an island.

46:08.916 --> 46:10.875
Do you ever go anywhere or do anything?

46:11.375 --> 46:14.166
Do you have any actual friends?
Doorknobs don't count.

46:14.250 --> 46:15.916
[scoffs] I'm just saying,

46:16.000 --> 46:18.833
don't be afraid to…
I don't know, have fun again.

46:18.916 --> 46:20.333
I'm not afraid of anything.

46:23.833 --> 46:25.583
-I'm gonna go to bed.
-[mouthing] What?

46:25.666 --> 46:27.083
It's like 5:30.

46:28.875 --> 46:31.708
I know you wanna sleep
all the time because you're sad.

46:31.791 --> 46:32.875
I know that feeling.

46:34.166 --> 46:36.000
But life is
what happens when you're awake.

46:36.083 --> 46:37.250
Not mine!

46:38.000 --> 46:39.125
[wistful music fades]

46:41.000 --> 46:43.000
[police sirens wail in distance]

46:48.833 --> 46:49.833
[Nemo sighs]

46:51.791 --> 46:54.166
[whining] Go to sleep.
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

46:55.583 --> 46:56.583
[Nemo sighs]

47:01.083 --> 47:03.916
-Damn it. This is interesting!
-[book thuds]

59:28.958 --> 59:31.041
I'll be sure to send you a postcard.

59:31.125 --> 59:33.125
In jail, of course.

59:34.458 --> 59:35.750
Whoo!

59:37.208 --> 59:39.875
Not like there's any glory in it.
Whoop-de-do!

59:39.958 --> 59:43.583
I caught Slumberland's 28th most wanted.

59:45.375 --> 59:48.458
-[watch beeps]
-[Flip groans] Twenty-eight? Try 13.

59:48.541 --> 59:50.125
You're slippin', mate.

59:50.916 --> 59:53.333
-Right. You're under arrest.
-[high-pitched] Aww!

59:53.416 --> 59:54.791
You got nothin'.

59:54.875 --> 59:58.416
You brought a squid to a salsa party.
Do you think that's funny?

59:58.500 --> 1:00:01.000
[Flip chuckles] Put it that way,
it's kinda funny. Right?

1:00:02.333 --> 1:00:03.458
Oh, okay.

1:00:04.666 --> 1:00:06.333
With popcorn, they're delicious.

1:00:07.958 --> 1:00:09.083
[whispering] Pick those up.

1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:13.250
You just put those in there.
I know I didn't do that.

1:00:14.125 --> 1:00:15.500
I stole that fair and square.

1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:18.458
-[Green] Where's my map?
-[Flip scoffs] Your map?

1:00:18.541 --> 1:00:21.583
It's ancient history.
I have no idea where that map is.

1:00:21.666 --> 1:00:23.875
And who's this? Your bodyguard?

1:00:23.958 --> 1:00:27.375
Who, her? Yeah, I dragged her along.
Got nothing to do with it. It was all me.

1:00:27.458 --> 1:00:28.916
You've done a lot of crime, Flip.

1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.458
-You're gonna do a lot of time.
-[faucets squeak]

1:00:31.541 --> 1:00:32.750
[Green] As in forever.

1:00:33.250 --> 1:00:34.916
[metal clanking]

1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:38.375
[Green] All right, let's get you locked up
and find that map, why don't we?

1:00:38.875 --> 1:00:41.208
I'm actually gonna miss hunting you down.

1:00:41.291 --> 1:00:43.166
Oi! [whistles] Here.

1:00:43.250 --> 1:00:46.625
If it makes you feel any better,
you could just let me go.

1:00:46.708 --> 1:00:48.625
[Green] Hmm…

1:00:48.708 --> 1:00:52.375
Nah, it's gonna make me feel
really good to lock you up.

1:00:52.875 --> 1:00:55.458
[chuckles] You make that sound kinda fun.

1:00:55.541 --> 1:00:58.083
-[doors and ceiling whirring]
-Whee! [sniffs]

1:00:59.208 --> 1:01:01.625
That was inappropriate. I'm… I'm sorry.

1:01:01.708 --> 1:01:03.625
-[elevator dings]
-You think you're this big man.

1:01:03.708 --> 1:01:05.875
-But you're just a pathetic little--
-Hey, Cindy.

1:01:05.958 --> 1:01:08.125
Oh! Hey, Frank.

1:01:08.208 --> 1:01:11.958
Cindy? 160-year-old Cindy.

1:01:12.041 --> 1:01:13.458
[mockingly] Sassy Cindy.

1:01:14.333 --> 1:01:18.166
-[grunts, softly] Sorry, Cindy. [sniffles]
-[display panel beeping]

1:01:23.875 --> 1:01:27.458
So, uh, still over in Oedipal dreams?

1:01:27.541 --> 1:01:29.708
Uh, no. They moved me to 6200.

1:01:30.708 --> 1:01:32.416
Oh. That's exhausting.

1:01:33.166 --> 1:01:35.250
[elevator bell dings]

1:01:35.333 --> 1:01:37.666
Hey, at least I get my steps in, right?

1:01:37.750 --> 1:01:40.083
-[Green] Mm-hmm.
-[high-pitched] Aww! [chuckles]

1:01:45.625 --> 1:01:46.541
Waffle?

1:01:47.583 --> 1:01:49.083
-[waffle splats]
-[Flip grunts]

1:01:49.875 --> 1:01:50.708
[elevator rattles]

1:01:50.791 --> 1:01:54.666
You're just a pathetic little man-boy.

1:01:55.166 --> 1:01:56.791
-Thank you.
-[Green] Mm.

1:01:56.875 --> 1:01:58.708
We run a finely tuned machine here.

1:01:58.791 --> 1:02:01.541
We can't have losers like you
botching up the works.

1:02:01.625 --> 1:02:03.541
And I've met punks like you before.

1:02:03.625 --> 1:02:04.750
"Whoo-hoo!"

1:02:04.833 --> 1:02:07.250
"Slumberland, just one nonstop party!"

1:02:07.333 --> 1:02:09.458
"I'm never gonna leave!"

1:02:10.583 --> 1:02:14.625
And then one day,
you realize… you're all alone.

1:02:14.708 --> 1:02:17.625
You've got no friends, no family.

1:02:18.125 --> 1:02:22.208
No one gives a damn about you,
all because you didn't want to wake up.

1:02:25.291 --> 1:02:27.083
What do you think I'm tryin' to do?

1:02:27.166 --> 1:02:29.375
[Green] Well, now
you'll just be a vague memory.

1:02:31.458 --> 1:02:33.875
-Flip, you had a good run. Mm.
-[elevator bell dings]

1:02:33.958 --> 1:02:36.000
But now, you're done.

1:02:36.083 --> 1:02:37.541
-[door slams]
-[lock clicks]

1:02:39.666 --> 1:02:41.500
No! No! No! No!

1:02:41.583 --> 1:02:43.500
Please! Stop!

1:02:43.583 --> 1:02:45.583
Stop! No!

1:02:45.666 --> 1:02:47.791
[Pig grunting]

1:02:51.083 --> 1:02:52.958
[Nemo whimpering]

1:02:53.041 --> 1:02:55.333
[Flip] Forget it, kid.
We're in here for good.

1:02:56.500 --> 1:02:57.666
[Nemo sighs]

1:03:03.791 --> 1:03:05.041
[Nemo] What do we do now?

1:03:05.125 --> 1:03:07.958
[sighs] There's nothing we can do.

1:03:10.333 --> 1:03:12.291
I thought you didn't wanna wake up.

1:03:13.833 --> 1:03:15.166
I can't.

1:03:15.875 --> 1:03:19.250
When you stay in Slumberland too long,
you forget everything.

1:03:19.750 --> 1:03:23.375
I just thought if I got that Pearl,
I could remember who I am.

1:03:23.458 --> 1:03:26.250
[gentle orchestral music playing]

1:03:26.333 --> 1:03:27.500
I just wanna wake up.

1:03:29.625 --> 1:03:31.000
She's right.

1:03:32.083 --> 1:03:33.625
Nobody gives a damn about me.

1:03:36.125 --> 1:03:37.291
I do.

1:03:39.791 --> 1:03:40.958
[high-pitched snicker]

1:03:41.041 --> 1:03:42.291
[high-pitched snicker]

1:03:43.500 --> 1:03:46.166
-[footsteps approaching]
-[keys jingle]

1:03:46.250 --> 1:03:48.166
Bodyguard, come with me.

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:50.250
What about him?

1:03:50.333 --> 1:03:52.041
[Green] Oh, he's checked in for good.

1:03:52.125 --> 1:03:53.083
But he can't help it.

1:03:53.166 --> 1:03:56.791
-He doesn't remember who he is.
-Chop-chop. Well, now he can remember.

1:03:56.875 --> 1:03:58.666
He's got loads of time.

1:04:00.250 --> 1:04:03.208
-Sorry it didn't work out, kid.
-[cell door squeaks, clangs]

1:04:03.291 --> 1:04:05.958
Not many people
get to peek behind the curtain.

1:04:06.041 --> 1:04:08.750
-Want to see where the magic happens?
-[phones ringing]

1:04:08.833 --> 1:04:12.250
Welcome to the Bureau
of Subconscious Activities.

1:04:12.333 --> 1:04:14.875
Clearly, management
hasn't updated our wardrobe

1:04:14.958 --> 1:04:17.166
or the facilities since the early '70s,

1:04:17.250 --> 1:04:22.083
'cause the Bureau blows its budgets
on the dreams, and we get the leftovers.

1:04:22.166 --> 1:04:23.791
So, two ways this can go.

1:04:23.875 --> 1:04:27.666
You can end up like Flip,
alone, in a cell forever.

1:04:27.750 --> 1:04:29.166
Or I can cut you loose,

1:04:29.250 --> 1:04:32.833
but I'm only going to do that
if you've learnt your lesson.

1:04:32.916 --> 1:04:37.666
Otherwise, you can go straight to rot
in a cell in juvie. [exhales]

1:04:37.750 --> 1:04:39.958
-[Pig grunting]
-[snaps fingers]

1:04:41.208 --> 1:04:46.000
So, looks like you're going
through some stuff.

1:04:46.666 --> 1:04:48.416
We gave you the lighthouse dream.

1:04:48.500 --> 1:04:51.625
That's your safe place.
The nightmares can't get you there.

1:04:52.416 --> 1:04:53.875
But my dad's not there.

1:04:54.791 --> 1:04:56.125
I wanna see my dad.

1:04:57.125 --> 1:05:00.541
Yeah, we don't give you what you want.
We give you what you need.

1:05:01.291 --> 1:05:03.583
Everything in Slumberland
happens for a reason.

1:05:03.666 --> 1:05:06.791
You're messing with
a finely tuned machine here, love.

1:05:06.875 --> 1:05:08.875
Then give me a dream with my dad.

1:05:10.416 --> 1:05:14.416
-And I'll never leave.
-Yeah. No dream lasts forever. All right?

1:05:14.916 --> 1:05:17.291
Sooner or later, they all fade.

1:05:17.375 --> 1:05:19.916
You're gonna visit the lighthouse
for a little while,

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:23.083
and then it's gonna be gone,
then you'll have other dreams.

1:05:23.166 --> 1:05:24.166
You'll move on.

1:05:24.250 --> 1:05:25.958
I don't wanna move on.

1:05:26.041 --> 1:05:28.291
[sighs] If you don't move on,

1:05:28.375 --> 1:05:31.791
the nightmares will find you,
and they will destroy you.

1:05:31.875 --> 1:05:33.958
Then how do I make them go away?

1:05:34.041 --> 1:05:35.458
By being brave.

1:05:35.958 --> 1:05:38.750
And when you're brave enough,
then they can't hurt you.

1:05:38.833 --> 1:05:40.250
I'm not afraid of anything.

1:05:40.333 --> 1:05:42.833
Being brave isn't about not being scared.

1:05:42.916 --> 1:05:45.708
It's about doing what you have to do,
even when you are.

1:05:45.791 --> 1:05:50.458
And I know you're not afraid
of car chases or jumping off cliffs.

1:05:50.958 --> 1:05:54.625
I'm talking about
what you're really scared of. Being alone.

1:05:56.000 --> 1:05:58.250
Someday, you're gonna find something new.

1:05:58.333 --> 1:06:00.208
Something so important

1:06:00.291 --> 1:06:03.750
that you're going to stop trying
to hold on to what's already gone.

1:06:04.375 --> 1:06:05.625
And when that happens,

1:06:05.708 --> 1:06:08.791
that big scary squid
that's been chasing you around?

1:06:08.875 --> 1:06:10.250
It'll vanish into thin air.

1:06:11.375 --> 1:06:12.625
No more nightmares.

1:06:14.916 --> 1:06:16.208
Until puberty.

1:06:17.125 --> 1:06:19.125
Yeah, that whole thing's
a frickin' nightmare.

1:06:20.291 --> 1:06:23.375
You think some magic Pearl's
gonna solve all your problems?

1:06:23.458 --> 1:06:25.166
Let me let you in on a little secret.

1:06:25.250 --> 1:06:27.208
[gentle music playing]

1:06:27.291 --> 1:06:29.791
[whispering] There are no Pearls.
It's a myth.

1:06:30.291 --> 1:06:31.416
Stay where you belong.

1:06:31.916 --> 1:06:34.750
Nemo, you have the dream
you're meant to have.

1:06:35.250 --> 1:06:36.750
We make sure of that.

1:06:37.708 --> 1:06:38.666
Time to wake up.

1:06:38.750 --> 1:06:41.541
-[Nemo panting]
-[gentle music fades]

1:06:46.250 --> 1:06:48.166
[door squeaks open]

1:06:50.083 --> 1:06:52.291
Hey. Can't sleep?

1:06:54.666 --> 1:06:55.708
Me neither.

1:06:57.333 --> 1:07:00.541
You know, things get darkest
right before the dawn.

1:07:01.791 --> 1:07:03.541
The world's stupid that way. [chuckles]

1:07:05.750 --> 1:07:07.500
[crying] I'm never gonna see him again.

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:09.250
[Philip inhales sharply]

1:07:10.375 --> 1:07:12.041
[wistful piano music playing]

1:07:12.125 --> 1:07:13.708
I wanna show you something.

1:07:15.125 --> 1:07:16.125
Sit down.

1:07:28.166 --> 1:07:31.166
I haven't looked
through this stuff in years.

1:07:32.708 --> 1:07:33.708
Ooh.

1:07:35.791 --> 1:07:37.541
Where is…? Ah.

1:07:43.208 --> 1:07:44.458
[camcorder whirs]

1:07:46.333 --> 1:07:47.333
[softly] Come on.

1:07:49.375 --> 1:07:50.375
That's your dad.

1:07:52.416 --> 1:07:53.958
[wistful music swells]

1:07:56.750 --> 1:07:57.875
That's my dad?

1:07:58.875 --> 1:08:00.458
[Philip] I worshipped him back then.

1:08:01.041 --> 1:08:04.083
Your dad and I,
all we really had was each other.

1:08:06.333 --> 1:08:10.291
He told me stories too… every night.

1:08:11.375 --> 1:08:13.458
Wild adventures we were gonna go on.

1:08:13.541 --> 1:08:16.041
Long-lost treasure we were gonna find.

1:08:16.625 --> 1:08:18.125
We lived in a fantasy world.

1:08:18.625 --> 1:08:20.875
Probably 'cause it was better
than the real world.

1:08:21.458 --> 1:08:22.541
Red string?

1:08:24.083 --> 1:08:26.541
Right, that was our special trick

1:08:26.625 --> 1:08:30.666
for finding each other
in our dreams. [chuckles]

1:08:30.750 --> 1:08:32.833
Your dad and I were convinced
we'd figured out

1:08:32.916 --> 1:08:35.458
how to meet up in our dreams
and go on those adventures.

1:08:36.041 --> 1:08:36.875
Flip?

1:08:38.541 --> 1:08:39.583
How'd you know about that?

1:08:41.250 --> 1:08:44.333
You're dressed like Flip.
I don't understand.

1:08:44.916 --> 1:08:47.416
Flip was my outlaw name.

1:08:49.041 --> 1:08:50.666
I was pretty shy.

1:08:50.750 --> 1:08:53.500
When I was with other kids,
I barely spoke.

1:08:53.583 --> 1:08:55.458
But when I was
with your dad in our dreams,

1:08:55.541 --> 1:08:57.708
I could be whoever I wanted to be.

1:08:57.791 --> 1:08:59.791
And for me, that was Flip.

1:09:02.333 --> 1:09:06.166
And then your dad met your mom,
and she was so great.

1:09:08.208 --> 1:09:09.541
Looked just like you.

1:09:10.916 --> 1:09:14.375
And um… they decided
to have a real adventure.

1:09:15.208 --> 1:09:17.166
I begged him not to go.

1:09:18.041 --> 1:09:21.416
But off they went,
sailed around the world.

1:09:21.916 --> 1:09:26.250
And then I was alone,
and I shut down, even worse than before.

1:09:26.333 --> 1:09:28.416
You said you don't remember your dreams.

1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:33.333
-That's when it started, right?
-[clicks tongue] Yeah, I guess.

1:09:34.708 --> 1:09:36.541
I was pretty broken up about it.

1:09:37.208 --> 1:09:39.125
I didn't sleep for three nights.

1:09:40.416 --> 1:09:43.833
And after that, no more Flip.

1:09:46.333 --> 1:09:47.500
I was just Philip.

1:09:50.708 --> 1:09:53.791
Your dad would call
from time to time to check in,

1:09:53.875 --> 1:09:57.166
and he'd tell me
about all his crazy adventures.

1:09:57.916 --> 1:10:00.125
And he'd ask me what I was doin', and…

1:10:02.125 --> 1:10:04.625
I'd have to tell him
all about my boring life.

1:10:05.208 --> 1:10:07.208
[shakily] So after a while, I just…

1:10:09.083 --> 1:10:10.458
let him go to voice mail.

1:10:14.541 --> 1:10:17.916
Anyway… ancient history now.

I heard Davenport
and Arya talking about her.

1:11:10.750 --> 1:11:13.041
You know why she moved here, right?

[Pig grunting]

1:18:42.208 --> 1:18:46.416
Well, you know, it's the gateway
to the Sea of Nightmares, so… [chuckles]

1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:49.375
Pearls are in here somewhere. All right.

1:18:51.708 --> 1:18:52.708
Okay.

1:18:54.125 --> 1:18:55.208
[Pig oinks]

1:18:55.291 --> 1:18:56.291
Ready?

1:18:56.375 --> 1:18:59.083
-[Nemo takes a deep breath]
-Here we go, partner.

1:18:59.625 --> 1:19:01.250
-I don't wanna go first.
-It's okay.

1:19:01.333 --> 1:19:03.666
-But I'm scared.
-[Flip] It's an initiation, so…

1:19:03.750 --> 1:19:05.333
-[Nemo] Okay.
-[Flip] All right.

1:19:05.416 --> 1:19:06.916

1:19:10.375 --> 1:19:11.500
[Flip] Oh.

1:19:12.416 --> 1:19:13.375
It's cold.

1:19:18.250 --> 1:19:19.166
[Flip] Whoa.

1:19:24.333 --> 1:19:26.333
[waves crashing]

1:19:28.750 --> 1:19:30.166
[Flip] That's a whole lot of water.

1:19:30.250 --> 1:19:31.833
Okay. [clears throat]

1:19:32.625 --> 1:19:34.625
Gonna go for a little swim. No big deal.

1:19:35.208 --> 1:19:36.916
I know who you are.

1:19:38.166 --> 1:19:39.166
Huh?

1:19:39.250 --> 1:19:41.166
I found out in the Waking World.

1:19:41.250 --> 1:19:43.333
Why the hell didn't you tell me?

1:19:43.958 --> 1:19:46.708
Wait. Do I still have my hair?

1:19:46.791 --> 1:19:48.791
Yeah. Just not as much.

1:19:48.875 --> 1:19:50.041
Let me guess.

1:19:50.750 --> 1:19:52.791
I'm a famous outlaw, yeah?

1:19:52.875 --> 1:19:54.666
Men fear me? Ladies love me?

1:19:54.750 --> 1:19:56.541
You're a doorknob salesman.

1:19:57.750 --> 1:19:58.708
What'd you call me?

1:19:58.791 --> 1:20:00.791
You're my dad's brother, Philip.

1:20:01.666 --> 1:20:04.458
You and my dad came to Slumberland
every night when you were kids.

1:20:04.541 --> 1:20:05.625
And then, he left.

1:20:05.708 --> 1:20:06.875
Oh, wow.

1:20:06.958 --> 1:20:10.000
After that, Philip stopped dreaming,
and you couldn't wake up.

1:20:10.083 --> 1:20:11.625
I remember.

1:20:11.708 --> 1:20:13.041
But when you get your Pearl,

1:20:13.541 --> 1:20:16.208
you can wake up,
and you can be one person again.

1:20:17.375 --> 1:20:18.958
This is a buzzkill.

1:20:19.041 --> 1:20:21.375
I'm gonna get us both killed for that guy?

1:20:21.458 --> 1:20:24.916
We're so close, and he needs you.

1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:28.416
Well, I don't need him, all right?
I got everything that I want right here.

1:20:28.500 --> 1:20:30.791
Wine, women, waffles. The three dubs.

1:20:30.875 --> 1:20:32.708
Not necessarily in that order.

1:20:33.208 --> 1:20:34.791
I'm not a knob seller.

1:20:35.291 --> 1:20:36.666
I'm a flippin' outlaw!

1:20:38.083 --> 1:20:40.208
But I thought that when we get our Pearls,

1:20:40.791 --> 1:20:44.125
I could be with my dad at night,
and during the day, I could be with you.

1:20:44.208 --> 1:20:46.041
You could be like my part-time dad.

1:20:48.750 --> 1:20:50.333
I am nobody's dad, kid.

1:20:50.416 --> 1:20:52.083
So you're just giving up?

1:20:52.166 --> 1:20:53.666
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

1:20:53.750 --> 1:20:55.708
I'm gonna go find a dream
with a bar in it,

1:20:55.791 --> 1:20:57.916
and then I'm gonna drink
until I forget who I am again.

1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:01.041
Then I'm gonna go find someone's ex.
'Cause there's a lot of them around here.

1:21:01.125 --> 1:21:02.916
But I… I did the Double-Knock.

1:21:05.875 --> 1:21:07.250
So did I, kid.

1:21:08.875 --> 1:21:12.208
The night your dad left,
I begged him to stay.

1:21:14.458 --> 1:21:15.750
I'll go without you.

1:21:16.541 --> 1:21:20.333
I'll see my dad again,
and I don't care if I never wake up.

1:21:20.958 --> 1:21:22.750
Hey, no. You can't.

1:21:22.833 --> 1:21:24.541
It's too dangerous to go in alone.

1:21:25.041 --> 1:21:28.750
You can't tell me what to do…
'cause you're not my dad.

1:21:30.541 --> 1:21:32.041
I never shoulda brought you.

1:21:35.541 --> 1:21:37.083
Just go back to where you belong.

1:21:37.583 --> 1:21:39.333
Otherwise, you're gonna end up like me.

1:21:39.416 --> 1:21:40.791

1:21:42.166 --> 1:21:44.583

1:21:47.791 --> 1:21:50.166
[in a woman's voice] Nemo. Wake up.

1:21:51.208 --> 1:21:52.208
Wake up!

1:21:52.291 --> 1:21:54.583
-[Nemo gasps, shudders]
-[Arya] Nemo?

1:21:55.541 --> 1:21:56.708
Get your things.

1:21:57.916 --> 1:21:59.250
We're calling your uncle.

1:22:00.875 --> 1:22:02.750
[Arya] It's not just the lying, Nemo.

1:22:02.833 --> 1:22:06.333
It's sneaking off like that.
No one knew where you were.

1:22:06.416 --> 1:22:09.875
For all we knew,
you could've been in terrible danger.

1:22:09.958 --> 1:22:10.958
Yeah.

1:22:11.041 --> 1:22:12.125
Why would you do that?

1:22:12.750 --> 1:22:13.958
You wouldn't understand.

1:22:14.916 --> 1:22:16.333
Why don't you try me?

1:22:16.416 --> 1:22:19.083

1:22:23.208 --> 1:22:24.208
Okay.

1:22:25.166 --> 1:22:28.375
Well, m-- Maybe it would help
if, uh… if you went first.

1:22:28.458 --> 1:22:29.458
Philip?

1:22:30.083 --> 1:22:32.916
Would you like to tell Nemo
how you're feeling?

1:22:33.000 --> 1:22:35.583
I don't know what you want me to say.
I don't do feelings.

1:22:35.666 --> 1:22:38.291
Everyone does feelings,
whether you like it or not.

1:22:38.875 --> 1:22:41.916
You two are in the same boat.
You just don't realize it.

1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:43.125
Guys, come on.

1:22:43.208 --> 1:22:45.166
You're both struggling
with powerful emotions,

1:22:45.250 --> 1:22:47.625
and you just…
you just need to deal with them.

1:22:47.708 --> 1:22:48.875
Do we, though?

1:22:49.375 --> 1:22:54.083
Um, everybody always says that,
but… I'm not convinced.

1:22:54.166 --> 1:22:55.250
I-- I-- I've [scoffs]

1:22:55.333 --> 1:22:57.791
I've never dealt
with my feelings, and I'm fine.

1:22:59.666 --> 1:23:00.666
I was fine.

1:23:01.166 --> 1:23:03.000
Should've just had them send me
to foster care.

1:23:03.083 --> 1:23:04.708
You'd probably be better off.

1:23:06.166 --> 1:23:08.750
At least foster parents
know how to be parents.

1:23:10.666 --> 1:23:12.375
[thunder rumbling]

1:23:17.541 --> 1:23:19.250
Nemo, we should probably talk.

1:23:19.333 --> 1:23:22.291
I don't wanna talk.
You wanna get rid of me, so get rid of me.

1:23:22.375 --> 1:23:24.166
[sighs] I'm not trying
to get rid of you, Nemo.

1:23:24.250 --> 1:23:26.500
I'm… I'm trying to help you.

1:23:27.875 --> 1:23:29.375
You're as bad as he is.

1:23:30.291 --> 1:23:31.250
What? Who?

1:23:31.833 --> 1:23:33.083
You only care about yourself.

1:23:33.166 --> 1:23:36.791

I have done nothing but take care of you.

1:23:47.458 --> 1:23:50.291

my precious lockpicks so--

Why do you think you have no friends?

1:23:55.375 --> 1:23:57.000

1:44:03.833 --> 1:44:05.833
-Come on, Nemo!
-[Carla] Seven, eight, nine.

1:44:06.750 --> 1:44:08.791
-[Philip] Breathe!
-[Carla] Come on. Oh.

1:44:10.583 --> 1:44:12.208
To guide you on your journey.

1:44:14.291 --> 1:44:15.166
That's right.

1:44:15.750 --> 1:44:16.833
So you can see things

1:44:16.916 --> 1:44:20.083
that the lighthouse keeper
can only dream of.

1:44:20.166 --> 1:44:23.250
I didn't teach you all those things
so you could live on an island.

1:44:24.375 --> 1:44:26.458
I did it so that you could know…

1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:29.375
you can do anything.

1:44:29.875 --> 1:44:32.000
[Carla] Okay, come on, Nemo.

1:44:32.500 --> 1:44:33.500
[softly] Come on.

1:44:36.750 --> 1:44:38.250
One, two, three…

1:44:39.041 --> 1:44:41.166
I didn't think I could go on without you.

1:44:42.208 --> 1:44:46.833
You traveled to the Sea of Nightmares
and came back home safe again.

1:44:49.708 --> 1:44:52.916
After that, I don't think
the Waking World's gonna be too difficult.

1:44:55.250 --> 1:44:56.583
But that's up to you.

1:44:59.125 --> 1:45:01.041
Life is waiting for you, Nemo.

1:45:03.458 --> 1:45:05.291
It would be a shame to miss that.

1:45:09.041 --> 1:45:10.583
[crying] I have to go back.

1:45:12.166 --> 1:45:13.291
That's my girl.

1:45:14.458 --> 1:45:17.958
[takes a deep breath]
And you never forget…

1:45:20.708 --> 1:45:22.666
how very proud I am of you.

1:45:24.875 --> 1:45:27.125
And keep an eye on that brother of mine.

1:45:27.625 --> 1:45:30.625
He seems normal, but he's not.

1:45:31.583 --> 1:45:33.416
Deep down, he's a wild man.

1:45:40.750 --> 1:45:41.750
Bye, Dad.

1:45:42.625 --> 1:45:43.625
[sighs]

1:45:49.000 --> 1:45:51.375
[Peter takes a deep breath]

1:45:52.416 --> 1:45:53.666
[Nemo coughing]

1:45:53.750 --> 1:45:55.375
[Carla] Okay, let's go!

1:45:55.458 --> 1:45:56.708
Come on, get her over!

1:45:56.791 --> 1:45:59.250
There we go! Good girl, Nemo!

1:45:59.333 --> 1:46:01.583
-[laughing] Good girl!
-[Philip sobbing]

1:46:02.208 --> 1:46:03.250
[Carla] Good girl.

1:46:04.333 --> 1:46:06.750
You're okay. You're okay.

1:46:06.833 --> 1:46:08.083
I got you.

1:46:08.166 --> 1:46:11.000
And I'm not gonna
let go of you ever, okay?

1:46:11.500 --> 1:46:12.708
Flip?

1:46:14.291 --> 1:46:15.291
[softly] Yeah.

1:46:15.375 --> 1:46:16.583
[mimics Flip] It's Flip.

1:46:18.083 --> 1:46:19.166
And Philip.

1:46:19.250 --> 1:46:20.333
Philip and Flip.

1:46:21.125 --> 1:46:22.791
Flilip? [high-pitched snicker]

1:46:23.833 --> 1:46:25.041
[high-pitched snicker]

1:46:25.125 --> 1:46:29.625
-[Philip chuckles]
-[both crying]

1:46:29.708 --> 1:46:31.083

-[Nemo laughing]
-[bright instrumental music playing]

1:46:39.375 --> 1:46:40.791
-Okay, see ya!
-Bye!

1:46:40.875 --> 1:46:41.750
Bye!

1:46:41.833 --> 1:46:44.833
-[Undeadheads groan]
-[Nemo] Bye, Jamal. See you tomorrow.

1:46:44.916 --> 1:46:45.916
[Jamal] See ya.

1:46:47.500 --> 1:46:51.375
You know, not a lot of people know this,
but I'm actually a master pickpocket.

1:46:51.458 --> 1:46:53.958
Oh, come on. No, you're not. [chuckles]

1:46:54.041 --> 1:46:55.750
[high-pitched] Boop! [chuckles]

1:46:55.833 --> 1:46:58.083
-Oh my G--
-You have very smooth wrists.

1:46:58.166 --> 1:47:00.125
[Arya] Wait. What? How did you…?

1:47:00.708 --> 1:47:02.083
I'm gonna take you sailing.

1:47:04.208 --> 1:47:05.916
Maybe next time you can come with us.

1:47:06.708 --> 1:47:08.416
Yeah, I'd love to. [chuckles]

1:47:08.500 --> 1:47:09.375
Aces.

1:47:09.458 --> 1:47:11.375
Oh. Oh, wait. I need my watch back.

1:47:11.458 --> 1:47:13.125
[Philip and Arya laugh] Yeah.

1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:16.166
No. No, seriously.
Can I get my watch back?

1:47:16.833 --> 1:47:18.083
[quietly] Call me.

1:47:19.250 --> 1:47:21.041
[soaring orchestral music playing]

1:47:25.375 --> 1:47:27.375

1:47:43.208 --> 1:47:44.583
Oh, great.

1:47:45.083 --> 1:47:46.958
You're already dressed for bed.

1:47:47.041 --> 1:47:48.916
[Nemo] Well, I don't like to be late.

1:47:49.916 --> 1:47:51.750
So, what's the plan tonight?

1:47:52.250 --> 1:47:53.083
I don't know.

1:47:53.166 --> 1:47:56.375
I think I might just wander
and see what happens.

1:47:57.416 --> 1:47:58.583
Sounds good.

1:48:01.750 --> 1:48:04.041
-Night-night, kiddo. I love you.
-I love you too.

1:48:04.125 --> 1:48:06.125
-I'll try to be on time.
-[Nemo giggles]

1:48:10.125 --> 1:48:11.291
Sweet dreams.
