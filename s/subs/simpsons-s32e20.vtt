19:23.145 --> 19:24.403
Took 45 minutes.

19:24.555 --> 19:26.831
I'm here to see
if you'll finally admit

19:27.024 --> 19:29.408
you'd be better off
if you'd gone to college.

19:29.502 --> 19:30.576
Are you crazy?

19:30.728 --> 19:32.728
You still can't admit
you were wrong.

19:32.821 --> 19:34.397
Let me tell you something, lady.

19:34.490 --> 19:37.008
Wait a minute.
Just-just wait a minute.

19:37.159 --> 19:38.567
I'm president now.

19:38.661 --> 19:40.569
I have a lot of resources.

19:40.663 --> 19:43.163
Where's my mom translator?

19:44.166 --> 19:46.075
Maybe I started off
on the wrong foot.

19:46.093 --> 19:48.411
"You constantly let me down."

19:48.429 --> 19:51.430
Of course, I appreciate
everything you're saying.

19:51.557 --> 19:53.582
"You were never really in
my corner."

19:53.601 --> 19:56.694
I may have said
a lot of things in anger.

19:56.845 --> 19:59.588
"I meant what I said
and I will stick to it.

19:59.682 --> 20:03.759
But no matter what,
I was always proud of you."

20:03.819 --> 20:05.594
You made me mad, too.

20:05.613 --> 20:07.780
"I was hurt
because I care so much.

20:07.949 --> 20:11.767
All the respect and love I have
for people came from you."

20:11.786 --> 20:13.193
That's nice to hear.

20:13.287 --> 20:14.695
(choked up):
"I love you so much."

20:14.789 --> 20:15.696
(sobbing softly)

20:15.790 --> 20:17.698
"I love you, too."

20:17.792 --> 20:20.943
-(crying)
-Oh, oh.

20:20.962 --> 20:22.795
(sniffles)
Okay, you can go now.

20:22.889 --> 20:25.038
"This translator is fantastic.

20:25.058 --> 20:26.540
Give her a raise."

20:26.634 --> 20:28.951
(fireworks popping)

20:28.970 --> 20:30.210
(squealing)

20:30.230 --> 20:32.480
("Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"
plays)

20:41.632 --> 20:44.149
Okay. I enjoyed that story,
but I got to know,

20:44.302 --> 20:45.801
how much is really true?

20:46.061 --> 20:48.637
Let me consult the oracle.

20:48.731 --> 20:51.140
Okay, Lisa,
I'll give it to you straight.

20:51.233 --> 20:53.751
You've got a 98% chance
of going to college,

20:53.978 --> 20:55.235
83% Ivy League,

20:55.329 --> 20:56.812
47% chance of a boyfriend,

20:56.905 --> 20:58.814
72% chance of a girlfriend.

20:58.907 --> 20:59.832
Oh!

20:59.984 --> 21:02.242
(chuckles):
I like those odds!

21:02.336 --> 21:04.003
Hey, can I get the game on this?

21:04.097 --> 21:06.171
It's not a TV.
