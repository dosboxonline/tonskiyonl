WEBVTT

00:07.466 --> 00:13.514
There was this gray hall, but then...

00:15.224 --> 00:19.394
everything was, like, so white.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.940
We're making progress.

00:23.774 --> 00:25.733
It's not just waking up on a table.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.611
It's human interaction.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.364
This didn't feel human,
this felt like a nightmare.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.368
I mean, why is she
rattling off a bunch of facts?

00:36.119 --> 00:38.204
What are they doing to her?

00:38.205 --> 00:40.832
All I know is she's essential.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.922
She didn't even recognize me.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.845
The Gemma you know is still in there.

00:55.138 --> 00:58.684
And when you get her out, it will be
the two of you out here together.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.574
Bargaining.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.034
You know what that is?

01:16.702 --> 01:18.161
What do you mean?

01:20.122 --> 01:22.332
Well, it's one of the stages.

01:24.251 --> 01:28.921
You think about all the things you'd do,

01:28.922 --> 01:34.970
and all the ways you'd change
to get that person back.

01:37.806 --> 01:43.228
You'd drink less. You'd listen more.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.901
It's dumb, but you do it anyway.

01:49.902 --> 01:51.027
It's normal.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.112
Yeah.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.242
But for me, it might actually happen.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.418
<i>It was a sketch of a black hallway,</i>

02:07.419 --> 02:09.880
with a black elevator that only goes down.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.135
So there's a floor beneath us.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.845
That must be where they're keeping her.

02:17.846 --> 02:19.890
There were directions on the back.

02:20.516 --> 02:21.642
Well, let's see it.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.229
I left it there, behind the poster.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.064
Why didn't you just take it?

02:28.065 --> 02:29.649
I just didn't, okay?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.192
I don't wanna get in trouble right now.

02:31.193 --> 02:33.402
Okay. Well, I don't give a shit
about that, so I'll go get it.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.571
You said it's behind the poster
of you actually being brave?

02:35.572 --> 02:37.615
Okay, yeah. Fuck you.
You don't know everything.

02:37.616 --> 02:38.992
Then tell us.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.162
It's okay.

02:51.255 --> 02:54.382
Okay. Well, I still have a hall pass,
so I can go to the break room now,

02:54.383 --> 02:56.259
- and then we can start after lunch.
- Yeah. Maybe.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.468
Maybe?

02:57.469 --> 02:59.929
Did everyone sever their balls
in the elevator this morning?

02:59.930 --> 03:01.306
I'm starving.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.999
Mark?

03:28.667 --> 03:29.668
Are you okay?

05:03.303 --> 05:04.304
Sir?

05:06.682 --> 05:07.808
Have a seat.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.609
I had my performance review yesterday.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.947
How did it go?

05:30.038 --> 05:34.168
Many valid concerns were raised,
which I look forward to addressing.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.045
I'm glad for you.

05:46.054 --> 05:48.056
I feel I should remind you,

05:48.599 --> 05:50.141
you cannot graduate from this fellowship

05:50.142 --> 05:53.270
until I have deemed you
Wintertide material.

05:58.317 --> 06:02.821
This will mean using your time well,
focusing on your own duties,

06:03.572 --> 06:06.825
and eradicating
from your essence childish folly.

06:11.622 --> 06:13.165
I understand, sir.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.794
I shall be busy for the rest of the day.

06:18.295 --> 06:21.256
I trust you can steward
the floor in my stead?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.592
- Of course.
- Good.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.845
You may sit at your regular desk.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.144
Thank you, Mr. Milchick.

06:49.243 --> 06:51.118
- <i>He threatened you?</i>
- <i>As I was leaving.</i>

06:51.119 --> 06:52.286
In the elevator.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.996
They're trying to intimidate us.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.748
- Divide us.
- And also--

06:55.749 --> 06:57.375
It's so that we won't work together,

06:57.376 --> 06:59.919
because they know what will happen
if we do. I'm gonna go get that map.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.672
Helly, we shared vessels.

07:03.215 --> 07:04.216
What's that?

07:06.343 --> 07:08.512
Well, we...

07:10.180 --> 07:14.476
we had sex.

07:16.645 --> 07:17.771
Okay.

07:18.814 --> 07:24.945
You and... Like, in a Wellness session?

07:26.405 --> 07:28.906
No. Not... Ms. Casey.

07:28.907 --> 07:32.703
It was at the retreat.

07:35.372 --> 07:36.832
In your tent.

07:41.879 --> 07:43.088
Yeah.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.053
You mean...

07:53.223 --> 07:55.893
I mean, obviously, you know,
I thought it was you.

07:57.811 --> 08:02.440
'Cause, you know,
I've been having those feelings since,

08:02.441 --> 08:04.734
like, before the OTC.

08:04.735 --> 08:09.239
So when she... I just... I had no idea, okay?

08:11.325 --> 08:13.492
- Uh-huh.
- I'm sorry, Helly.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.994
I... She tricked me.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.829
I mean, I... you know, wanted to, but she...

08:16.830 --> 08:19.875
she tricked both of us.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.050
It's probably another tactic.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.260
Something to drive a wedge between us.

08:31.261 --> 08:32.845
- Like--
- Helly--

08:32.846 --> 08:34.640
I'm gonna go for a walk.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.729
Helly, I'm sorry. I thought it was you.

08:41.230 --> 08:42.688
But it wasn't me.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.734
Yeah, I'm just gonna go walk around.

10:03.395 --> 10:05.480
First date, let me guess.

10:06.231 --> 10:08.608
- Scuba.
- Thai food.

10:08.609 --> 10:09.692
Nice.

10:09.693 --> 10:12.028
Though you did take
scuba lessons last year.

10:12.029 --> 10:14.322
Yeah? Which sea?

10:14.323 --> 10:15.823
It was in a pool.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.868
Okay. Cool.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.120
It was a little expensive.

10:23.081 --> 10:24.999
You've had a lot of phases.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.002
Scuba diving, woodworking.

10:28.003 --> 10:30.213
Wow. So, my outie's really diverse.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.132
Garage beer-making.

10:34.092 --> 10:40.933
Maybe I'm trying to find something
I excel in up there, like I do down here.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.105
I sometimes wonder
if you're just not happy.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.526
I'm sure it's not that.

10:51.109 --> 10:57.574
'Cause, like, you know... I mean,
here, with you, I'm super happy.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.702
I just, like, wanna hear
about all my offspring

11:01.703 --> 11:04.289
and stare at your face.

11:08.043 --> 11:11.128
- Sorry. That was weird.
- No.

11:11.129 --> 11:12.798
It was really sweet.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.342
I like it.

11:16.426 --> 11:17.886
I like this.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.558
I wish we could really be together.

11:23.559 --> 11:26.520
Like, all the time.

11:28.647 --> 11:30.107
I mean, we are.

11:31.733 --> 11:32.901
Aren't we?

11:35.237 --> 11:36.613
You and him are.

11:38.407 --> 11:39.616
But I'm not.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.882
Is it okay if we try the hug again?

11:55.883 --> 11:57.593
I kind of like the hugging.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.793
Oh, hey. I was coming to find you.

13:55.794 --> 13:57.171
Same.

13:58.964 --> 14:01.799
Look, I am so sorry.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.302
I can't even imagine
what it must be like to--

14:04.303 --> 14:05.721
You thought it was me.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.472
Hundred percent.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.016
Which means you wanted to.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.351
With me.

14:13.770 --> 14:15.105
Yeah.

14:16.815 --> 14:19.318
What sucks is that she got
to have that, and I didn't.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.364
That she used me to trick my friends.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.867
Used my body to get close to you.

14:27.868 --> 14:30.662
That she dresses me in
the morning like I'm a baby.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.165
That she controls me,
and this company, and all of us.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.542
It's disgusting.

14:49.431 --> 14:55.144
Hey, do you want me to,
like, describe what happened?

14:55.145 --> 14:56.771
Like, I feel like you
have every right to know.

14:56.772 --> 14:58.565
No. I don't want her memory.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.400
Okay.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.197
I want my own.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.664
Would you like that?

15:18.794 --> 15:20.128
Yeah, I'd like that.

15:26.260 --> 15:28.053
But how?

16:18.228 --> 16:19.730
A tent.

16:48.634 --> 16:49.801
I'm nervous.

16:51.428 --> 16:52.429
Me too.

16:54.223 --> 16:55.598
- You too.
- It's okay.

16:55.599 --> 16:56.767
Okay.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.565
Wait.

18:00.581 --> 18:01.582
Yes?

18:03.959 --> 18:04.960
Yes.

19:30.254 --> 19:34.675
You must eradicate from
your essence childish folly.

19:39.263 --> 19:44.059
You must eradicate from
yourself childish folly.

19:57.781 --> 20:00.367
You must abandon childish things.

20:03.954 --> 20:05.414
You must grow up.

20:07.749 --> 20:10.085
You must grow up.

20:11.128 --> 20:12.379
Grow up.

20:13.505 --> 20:14.798
Grow up.

20:16.842 --> 20:18.218
Grow up.

20:20.470 --> 20:21.638
Grow.

20:22.472 --> 20:23.599
Grow.

20:24.850 --> 20:25.851
Grow.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.520
Grow.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.191
Grow.

20:56.632 --> 20:58.258
Was it different with me?

21:10.604 --> 21:12.356
Oh, no, you're bleeding.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.194
No, you are.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.410
You have two minutes left.

21:26.828 --> 21:31.083
Humidity on the severed floor
is maintained at a consistent 45%.

21:32.793 --> 21:33.794
It must be something else.

21:36.088 --> 21:37.214
Did you punch him?

21:39.341 --> 21:40.842
I mean, not today.

21:40.843 --> 21:43.637
What were you doing
when the nosebleed occurred?

21:44.972 --> 21:48.642
We were refining something.

21:50.352 --> 21:51.812
Do you have a deviated septum?

21:52.604 --> 21:54.565
Well, I don't know what that is.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.568
Would you like me to put
petroleum jelly in your nostrils?

21:58.902 --> 22:00.152
No, thanks.

22:00.153 --> 22:02.238
Any other symptoms?

22:02.239 --> 22:04.950
Any auras or hallucinations?

22:07.327 --> 22:10.414
No. I think it stopped. I feel better.

22:12.624 --> 22:14.501
I'm going to take your blood pressure.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.009
<i>Where are you?</i>

22:23.010 --> 22:25.345
I'm at Lumon.

22:29.183 --> 22:31.143
- What?
- What?

22:35.814 --> 22:38.734
- Fuck. I was just--
- <i>Mark?</i>

22:40.819 --> 22:41.904
Wha--

22:42.529 --> 22:43.946
Were you just at Lumon?

22:43.947 --> 22:45.781
What time is it?

22:45.782 --> 22:47.867
Are you at Lumon
or in your basement with me?

22:47.868 --> 22:50.161
I don't know.

22:50.162 --> 22:51.412
Do you remember a hallway?

22:51.413 --> 22:52.496
A black hallway?

22:52.497 --> 22:57.960
I remember... Okay.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.505
I remember a desk.

23:00.214 --> 23:04.008
I remember a desk.

23:04.009 --> 23:09.598
I remember... Shit.

23:12.643 --> 23:14.478
That was another crossover memory.

23:15.187 --> 23:17.313
A recent one. That's good.

23:17.314 --> 23:20.191
You'll feel gaps in time
until it all comes back together.

23:20.192 --> 23:21.777
Well, when the fuck is that gonna happen?

23:25.322 --> 23:28.033
We need to enhance. Speed up the process.

23:29.326 --> 23:30.410
Is that safe?

23:31.954 --> 23:33.830
There's a slight chance of hemorrhage.

23:34.665 --> 23:37.084
Okay. So, me bleeding to death.

23:39.086 --> 23:40.546
Not necessarily.

23:42.422 --> 23:44.424
We'll flood the chip itself.

23:44.967 --> 23:46.051
Flood the chip?

23:46.844 --> 23:49.887
- Through the hole in your head.
- Jesus Christ.

23:49.888 --> 23:51.556
- That you've already got.
- Okay--

23:51.557 --> 23:52.890
You know what?

23:52.891 --> 23:54.642
Get the fuck off me.

23:54.643 --> 23:56.686
- I am not doing this, okay?
- We're close. It's happening.

23:56.687 --> 23:58.896
- Get this shit off right now! Please.
- We need to push!

23:58.897 --> 24:00.398
Get it off--

24:00.399 --> 24:02.942
God. I'm fu... I'm starving.

24:02.943 --> 24:04.610
That's also from reintegration.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.196
Okay, you know what?

24:06.989 --> 24:08.532
I'm gonna go eat.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.037
Fuck.

24:53.243 --> 24:54.244
Hello.

24:56.788 --> 24:58.123
Who the hell are you?

25:00.959 --> 25:02.085
It's a joke.

25:03.253 --> 25:05.880
- Come on in. Hey.
- Okay.

25:05.881 --> 25:07.466
What the heck?

25:10.719 --> 25:13.763
Fields is tending the ham.

25:13.764 --> 25:16.016
I hope you like a cumin glaze.

25:16.558 --> 25:18.184
Yes, of course.

25:18.185 --> 25:20.144
- Do you not?
- No, I do.

25:20.145 --> 25:21.312
Attila.

25:21.313 --> 25:22.855
Yes, Attila?

25:22.856 --> 25:24.899
Did you just ask about the glaze?

25:24.900 --> 25:26.902
- I did.
- Well, don't.

25:27.569 --> 25:28.820
I've already put it on.

25:29.530 --> 25:32.281
I was gonna say we also have corn.

25:32.282 --> 25:34.325
Oh, yes.

25:34.326 --> 25:37.371
We could feed him a pile of loose corn.

25:40.999 --> 25:45.420
What your innie ever saw
in this Philistine

25:46.463 --> 25:48.090
is beyond me.

25:49.633 --> 25:51.676
Fields, I presume.

25:51.677 --> 25:52.802
Yes.

25:52.803 --> 25:54.179
- Irving.
- Irving.

25:54.721 --> 25:55.721
Yes.

25:55.722 --> 25:57.598
Welcome back to our home.

25:57.599 --> 26:01.519
Yes. I'm sorry about the last time.

26:01.520 --> 26:05.148
I'm sure that felt quite invasive.

26:06.066 --> 26:07.484
Nonsense.

26:08.235 --> 26:09.945
What's mine's yours.

26:11.530 --> 26:13.866
And you've brought wine.

26:17.286 --> 26:22.248
Irving, no one's ever thrown blood
on you on your way into work?

26:22.249 --> 26:25.168
- No.
- It wasn't blood. It was paint.

26:25.169 --> 26:26.752
Meant to evoke blood.

26:26.753 --> 26:27.879
Not what you said.

26:27.880 --> 26:32.049
The Whole Mind people
are off the deep end, is my point.

26:32.050 --> 26:35.220
And, Burt, how did
you come to be at the company?

26:36.263 --> 26:38.432
- Me?
- Yes, I'm very curious.

26:38.932 --> 26:43.979
Well, as a matter of fact,
I was guided to Lumon's door by Jesus.

26:47.858 --> 26:50.444
Jesus Christ?

26:51.361 --> 26:52.905
That's the one.

26:54.948 --> 26:58.159
You should just leave it at that, and
let him wonder what the hell you meant.

26:58.160 --> 27:01.955
No, we'd been attending
the Lutheran church for some years.

27:02.664 --> 27:06.918
And I should mention that I'd been
what you might call a scoundrel

27:06.919 --> 27:08.669
in my younger days.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.422
To put it mildly.

27:11.298 --> 27:14.926
So, one Sunday at breakfast,
Fields asked me point blank,

27:14.927 --> 27:16.720
do I think I'm going to heaven?

27:18.138 --> 27:20.599
As one asks at breakfast.

27:21.225 --> 27:27.396
I pretend to think about it,
but I know the answer is no.

27:27.397 --> 27:32.528
To which I replied, "What am I supposed to
do up there for eternity all by myself?"

27:33.362 --> 27:36.489
- I see.
- So we hop on the train to church,

27:36.490 --> 27:40.034
and it so happens the sermon that day
is about severance...

27:40.035 --> 27:43.079
- Yeah.
- ...which was still very new at the time.

27:43.080 --> 27:44.664
And the pastor says--

27:44.665 --> 27:48.210
As if he'd been listening
to our conversation,

27:48.710 --> 27:53.840
he said the church's stance
is that innies are, you know,

27:53.841 --> 27:59.137
complete individuals, with souls...

28:01.139 --> 28:05.227
that can be judged
separately from their outie.

28:07.771 --> 28:11.148
So, an innie can go to heaven.

28:11.149 --> 28:13.235
Whilst the outie burns.

28:16.446 --> 28:18.240
We're not zealots, I swear.

28:18.991 --> 28:22.451
But we figured that if it were true,

28:22.452 --> 28:26.748
it may be a way for part of Burt to--

28:28.959 --> 28:30.085
You know...

28:34.923 --> 28:35.966
Wow.

28:38.135 --> 28:41.263
- He's looking for the exit.
- No, it's just--

28:42.639 --> 28:48.144
So, the hope was for Burt's
innie to go to heaven.

28:48.145 --> 28:51.565
Yes. With me.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.901
Gretch, it's the end of the month.

29:36.902 --> 29:40.321
Those salesmen are just dying to hit
their numbers and get cars off the lot.

29:40.322 --> 29:42.449
They'll basically be giving me money.

29:47.412 --> 29:49.121
Okay. Fine.

29:49.122 --> 29:50.957
Just test drive only.

29:50.958 --> 29:53.084
I won't commit to anything.

29:53.085 --> 29:58.131
- Thank you.
- No.

29:58.924 --> 30:01.677
You didn't tell me how'd it go.
You went back to Lumon, right?

30:05.764 --> 30:06.598
No.

30:07.474 --> 30:08.767
That good?

30:11.728 --> 30:12.813
They canceled it.

30:13.647 --> 30:15.566
I didn't see him... you.

30:16.483 --> 30:18.150
- Happy plate.
- Happy plate.

30:18.151 --> 30:20.027
Go play with your sister.

30:20.028 --> 30:21.738
Canceled it? What happened?

30:22.322 --> 30:25.993
They didn't say. Guess you got too busy.

30:28.787 --> 30:33.000
- Hey. Buddy. Try it. No. Okay.
- No.

31:02.112 --> 31:03.113
Thank you.

31:44.446 --> 31:48.033
Mark Scout.

31:49.826 --> 31:52.870
Thought that was you.
I'm Helena Eagan. I work at Lumon.

31:52.871 --> 31:55.415
Yeah. No, I know who you are.

31:59.044 --> 32:00.504
Well, it's nice to officially meet you.

32:09.179 --> 32:10.305
Have you had enough to eat?

32:13.058 --> 32:14.601
Yeah, quite possibly.

32:16.186 --> 32:18.229
I hope they're feeding you at work.

32:18.230 --> 32:19.314
May I?

32:21.650 --> 32:22.651
Please.

32:28.657 --> 32:30.032
It's really great to run into you.

32:30.033 --> 32:32.535
I've heard nothing but good things
about your work, by the way.

32:32.536 --> 32:35.622
Thank you. I've heard nothing at all
about my work, so...

32:36.748 --> 32:39.000
Severance humor. That's so clever.

32:39.001 --> 32:40.252
And so easy.

32:43.297 --> 32:49.136
Look, I'm sorry for the systemic error
from the other night.

32:49.803 --> 32:51.095
The systemic error?

32:51.096 --> 32:54.266
You mean the overtime thing?

32:55.184 --> 32:57.144
Yes. The OTC.

33:00.480 --> 33:03.901
It never should have happened,
and it never will again.

33:04.484 --> 33:10.489
We take pride as a company to be better
than that, and we will be better.

33:10.490 --> 33:13.243
- Well, that's nice to hear. Thanks.
- Of course.

33:18.540 --> 33:20.584
So, you know all about it then.

33:21.084 --> 33:22.961
Yes, I know all about it.

33:24.880 --> 33:27.174
I'm, like, the head of the company, Mark.

33:29.510 --> 33:32.970
Right. Dumb. Sorry.

33:32.971 --> 33:34.138
Yeah, you should be sorry.

33:34.139 --> 33:36.390
- Really? Okay.
- I'm kidding.

33:36.391 --> 33:38.226
You're clearly not dumb.

33:38.227 --> 33:39.936
I don't know. You...

33:39.937 --> 33:42.813
You're the one who invented
a revolutionary medical procedure.

33:42.814 --> 33:44.732
Hey, now, that was not me.

33:44.733 --> 33:45.816
That was my father.

33:45.817 --> 33:46.902
Uh-huh.

33:48.904 --> 33:50.239
You should meet him sometime.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.074
Your father?

33:53.075 --> 33:54.158
Sure. Why not?

33:54.159 --> 33:56.245
You wanna take me home to Dad already?

33:57.079 --> 33:58.579
Yeah, I think it's finally time.

33:58.580 --> 34:00.624
Okay. Sure. Let's do it.

34:02.209 --> 34:03.293
You'd be the first.

34:04.545 --> 34:07.422
- So, no pressure.
- Yeah. None whatsoever.

34:13.387 --> 34:16.430
But seriously, I'd love to hear
about your experiences sometime.

34:16.431 --> 34:18.016
Okay. Yeah.

34:19.476 --> 34:20.475
About severance?

34:20.476 --> 34:24.731
I meant the overtime con...
I meant the other night.

34:26.525 --> 34:30.528
I mean, I can't imagine how confusing
that must have been.

34:30.529 --> 34:31.989
Traumatic, even.

34:33.949 --> 34:38.495
And I know you've already been through
so much with losing your wife and all.

34:40.746 --> 34:41.748
Hanna.

34:46.295 --> 34:47.295
Gemma.

34:49.005 --> 34:52.092
Right. Gemma. Sorry.

34:54.428 --> 34:56.346
It was a car accident, right?

34:57.890 --> 34:58.891
That's right.

35:00.893 --> 35:02.394
Yeah, such a shame.

35:04.730 --> 35:05.981
She was so young.

35:11.528 --> 35:12.529
Thank you.

35:23.040 --> 35:24.541
Are you all right?

35:25.501 --> 35:27.835
I'm fine. I'm just about finished here.

35:27.836 --> 35:29.546
Okay. Right.

35:32.799 --> 35:35.469
Well, it was nice to meet you, Helena.

35:36.053 --> 35:38.055
Yeah. You too, Mark.

35:52.194 --> 35:53.278
What is it?

35:56.406 --> 35:57.407
Nothing.

36:00.786 --> 36:03.080
Good night.

37:16.445 --> 37:18.613
We used to call each other hon,

37:18.614 --> 37:22.617
then about ten years ago
that became Attila.

37:22.618 --> 37:25.661
Because... Do you know history?

37:25.662 --> 37:28.498
- Yeah.
- He knows history.

37:30.584 --> 37:32.960
And it wasn't ten years ago. It was 20.

37:32.961 --> 37:35.713
- No.
- Yes!

37:35.714 --> 37:42.637
Because I remember we were having drinks
with your Lumon partner.

37:42.638 --> 37:44.223
Quite startled him.

37:48.352 --> 37:51.938
Didn't the first severed office
open 12 years ago?

37:51.939 --> 37:53.649
- Yes, it did.
- Yeah.

37:54.733 --> 37:57.903
Maybe that's enough of that.

38:12.292 --> 38:15.462
You know the corn is very special.

38:16.171 --> 38:18.256
Do you think you two
ever made love at work?

38:18.257 --> 38:20.050
Fields, Jesus.

38:21.009 --> 38:24.805
Can we not just be
pragmatic adults about this?

38:27.599 --> 38:33.856
There is a nonzero chance that
the two of you had unprotected sex.

38:35.774 --> 38:38.527
And so, I felt the right to ask.

38:42.531 --> 38:46.451
Are you done humiliating our guest?

38:47.160 --> 38:50.872
Sounds like I'm mad, but I'm not.

38:50.873 --> 38:52.749
Cards on the table.

38:53.876 --> 38:56.335
I've been talking to
Pastor Gale about this,

38:56.336 --> 39:03.010
and I believe that
innies deserve to experience love.

39:07.639 --> 39:08.891
I mean it.

39:11.977 --> 39:14.188
And I hope it was beautiful.

39:33.999 --> 39:35.291
Sorry for being a dick.

39:35.292 --> 39:36.460
Let's do it.

39:37.503 --> 39:38.670
Tonight.

42:36.390 --> 42:37.432
There.

42:40.060 --> 42:41.602
How long will it take?

42:41.603 --> 42:43.188
It'll be fast.

42:44.022 --> 42:45.732
Fast. How fast?

42:57.160 --> 42:58.620
<i>I'm nervous.</i>

43:00.330 --> 43:01.456
<i>Yes.</i>

43:16.138 --> 43:17.138
What the fuck?

43:17.139 --> 43:20.224
Don't move like that.

43:20.225 --> 43:22.269
You have to keep your head still.

43:27.441 --> 43:28.442
Ignore it.

43:29.234 --> 43:30.319
Tell me--

43:33.113 --> 43:34.364
Mark?

43:36.033 --> 43:37.783
My car's in the driveway.
She knows I'm here.

43:37.784 --> 43:38.702
No...

43:45.501 --> 43:46.585
- Mark.
- Yeah?

43:50.839 --> 43:51.839
Hey.

43:51.840 --> 43:54.133
Dude, I left you, like, five messages.
Are you better?

43:54.134 --> 43:56.010
No, I'm still sick.

43:56.011 --> 43:59.138
Well, you can't not pick up when
we're doing corporate espionage shit.

43:59.139 --> 44:00.681
The floodlight thing was a bust, right?

44:00.682 --> 44:03.142
Because I have had an idea
that is a little dumber.

44:03.143 --> 44:04.227
Okay, Devon...

44:04.228 --> 44:05.770
Do you remember
the rich lady from baby camp?

44:05.771 --> 44:07.606
The one I, like, kind of had a crush on?

44:08.106 --> 44:10.066
- I was thinking--
- Yeah. Look,

44:10.067 --> 44:12.444
I'm already trying something else.

44:14.947 --> 44:16.532
Okay. What are you trying?

44:17.658 --> 44:20.660
Just don't worry about it.

44:20.661 --> 44:23.413
- What the fuck does that mean?
- I'm doing it myself.

44:24.790 --> 44:26.249
Fuck that.

44:26.250 --> 44:28.001
Why are you trying to cut me out of this?

44:29.127 --> 44:30.462
Shit.

44:31.755 --> 44:33.339
I'm really not, Devon.

44:33.340 --> 44:35.299
- You literally are.
- Okay, fine.

44:35.300 --> 44:38.177
I am, but I didn't ask for your help!

44:38.178 --> 44:39.470
Fuck you, officially.

44:39.471 --> 44:41.807
And what is that smell?

44:43.475 --> 44:44.476
What smell?

45:05.497 --> 45:06.540
Oh, my God.

45:12.045 --> 45:13.087
Mark.

45:13.088 --> 45:14.255
Don't touch him.

45:14.256 --> 45:15.841
Who the fuck are you?

45:16.717 --> 45:17.718
Mark?

45:19.303 --> 45:21.554
It's okay, buddy. It's okay.

45:21.555 --> 45:22.848
It's okay.

45:29.438 --> 45:31.814
Thank you for the spare ham.

45:31.815 --> 45:33.399
Is Fields...

45:33.400 --> 45:36.278
He's fine. He'll be embarrassed tomorrow.

45:37.196 --> 45:39.280
You know, he gets fuzzy.

45:39.281 --> 45:41.324
Like saying I worked
at Lumon 20 years ago,

45:41.325 --> 45:44.911
which is, of course,
before severance even existed.

45:44.912 --> 45:45.996
Of course.

45:48.999 --> 45:53.503
- Sorry.
- No, this was fun.

45:53.504 --> 45:55.129
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

45:55.130 --> 45:58.091
So, we should do it again sometime.

45:59.551 --> 46:01.802
You, me, Fields? Or you, me?

46:01.803 --> 46:04.013
No, I meant with Fields.

46:04.014 --> 46:06.099
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

46:07.017 --> 46:13.440
Yeah. But, you know, it's either way.

46:16.527 --> 46:17.402
Good.

46:24.117 --> 46:25.577
- Good night, Burt.
- Good night.
