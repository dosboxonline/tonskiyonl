WEBVTT

00:57.750 --> 01:00.333
This is not ideal.

01:00.333 --> 01:02.750
At least we're not hanging under the car.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.125
This isn't much better.

01:07.208 --> 01:09.875
Echo, get this car moving.

01:09.875 --> 01:12.333
The explosions must've knocked out power
to the rail line.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.208
I can try to reboot the system,

01:14.208 --> 01:17.291
but I will need to plug directly into
one of the terminals on the track.

01:17.291 --> 01:19.791
You three, give us cover.
Tech, up top with me.

01:53.916 --> 01:54.916
Whoa!

02:14.791 --> 02:17.208
I am plugged in. Stand by.

02:28.250 --> 02:32.333
<i>Six detonations confirmed.
Multiple casualties reported.</i>

02:32.875 --> 02:35.875
<i>Sir, we've engaged insurgents trapped
on the rail line.</i>

02:35.875 --> 02:38.458
Send in air support to shoot them down.

02:38.458 --> 02:41.833
<i>But, sir, our own troops
are trapped on the rail line.</i>

02:41.833 --> 02:43.833
<i>They could get caught in the cross fire.</i>

02:43.833 --> 02:45.541
I am aware. Do it.

03:06.791 --> 03:08.333
We've got three ships inbound.

03:09.166 --> 03:11.541
Where? I can't see them.

03:25.250 --> 03:26.625
Tech, we need power.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.041
Echo, now!

03:44.208 --> 03:45.208
We're online.

04:08.375 --> 04:09.250
Whoa!

04:39.166 --> 04:40.583
Come on, Tech! Hurry!

04:40.583 --> 04:45.416
I am climbing as fast as I can.

04:49.291 --> 04:50.750
Tech!

04:52.625 --> 04:54.041
Why aren't we moving?

04:55.541 --> 04:57.375
The car's being ripped from the track.

05:01.458 --> 05:03.916
Wrecker, get him on board.

05:06.500 --> 05:07.333
Whoa!

05:08.458 --> 05:09.833
Don't!

05:10.625 --> 05:13.375
Any shift in weight could send
both of these cars over.

05:25.583 --> 05:28.958
You must sever the connection hinge. Now!

05:28.958 --> 05:31.416
Not until you're up here.

05:37.083 --> 05:38.708
There is no time, Wrecker.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.083
Plan 99.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.666
Don't you do it, Tech!

05:58.708 --> 06:01.500
When have we ever followed orders?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.208
No!

06:07.208 --> 06:08.250
Tech!

06:19.291 --> 06:22.458
- Omega!
- Go back! Go back!

06:30.333 --> 06:32.041
The car's going too fast.

06:32.041 --> 06:34.041
The system's fried.
I can't stop it.

06:35.208 --> 06:36.875
Move! Look out!

07:16.166 --> 07:17.916
Tech.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.875
Omega!

07:43.000 --> 07:44.750
We have to get her out of here.

07:46.208 --> 07:47.583
I got you, kid.

07:47.583 --> 07:50.500
Incoming! Get to the <i>Marauder</i>.

07:55.875 --> 07:57.000
Come on! Come on!

08:08.375 --> 08:11.166
Head to Ord Mantell.
AZI can help her.

08:11.166 --> 08:13.083
Hurry!

08:30.833 --> 08:31.833
Hunter?

08:32.541 --> 08:34.541
Hiya, kid.

08:34.541 --> 08:36.583
W-What happened?

08:39.000 --> 08:41.875
Hello, Omega. I am relieved you are awake.

08:42.458 --> 08:44.375
You each sustained multiple injuries.

08:44.375 --> 08:48.833
However, you all will make a full recovery
with proper treatment and rest.

08:50.625 --> 08:52.333
You're-- You're okay.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.750
Don't scare us like that again.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.000
How do you feel?

09:00.541 --> 09:01.583
I don't know.

09:03.083 --> 09:05.666
The last thing that I remember,

09:06.791 --> 09:09.333
we were in the railcar when...

09:12.208 --> 09:13.458
Where's Tech?

09:14.916 --> 09:15.916
Omega,

09:16.958 --> 09:18.666
Tech didn't make it.

09:19.250 --> 09:20.416
We have to go back!

09:20.416 --> 09:23.125
What if he's hurt? He-- He needs us.

09:23.750 --> 09:24.791
Tell him, Wrecker.

09:25.666 --> 09:26.958
We can't just leave him!

09:27.708 --> 09:28.791
Omega...

09:28.791 --> 09:29.958
No!

09:29.958 --> 09:31.416
Tech's not gone!

09:32.416 --> 09:35.333
He-- He can't be!

09:36.958 --> 09:39.500
I-- I know, kid.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.041
Why did Tech do that?

09:56.750 --> 09:59.208
He didn't let us save him.

09:59.208 --> 10:01.291
He knew we were out of time.

10:02.208 --> 10:04.875
Tech put the squad ahead of himself.

10:06.208 --> 10:10.666
He made a sacrifice, Omega,
and we're not gonna waste it.

10:12.458 --> 10:13.583
What does that mean?

10:14.541 --> 10:19.208
The galaxy has changed, and so have we.

10:21.333 --> 10:25.750
It's time to put being soldiers behind us
for good.

10:26.916 --> 10:32.250
Wrecker and I think Pabu could be a good
place to make a new life for ourselves.

10:33.458 --> 10:39.875
And the rest of it, well,
we can figure out along the way.

10:42.083 --> 10:45.833
Omega, is that something you want?

10:50.416 --> 10:52.333
Then that's what we'll do.

11:05.958 --> 11:09.291
Here. This one's on the house.

11:11.250 --> 11:12.583
It won't help.

11:13.958 --> 11:16.375
I'm sorry about Goggles.

11:17.250 --> 11:18.791
I always liked him.

11:19.541 --> 11:22.958
Yeah. Me too.

11:38.958 --> 11:39.958
What is it?

11:47.458 --> 11:49.333
Hunter, the Empire's here.

11:50.416 --> 11:51.541
Hunter, do you copy?

11:52.458 --> 11:53.458
Wrecker?

11:58.875 --> 12:00.541
They're jamming our comms.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.750
No, stay here.

12:05.625 --> 12:06.625
I'll find them.

12:15.458 --> 12:16.666
What's with you?

12:18.416 --> 12:21.458
You know,
I tried to look out for you boys.

12:22.208 --> 12:24.083
But you got too much heat on you.

12:24.083 --> 12:27.250
And you brought it here
to my place of business.

12:28.708 --> 12:31.250
I had to make the best of a bad situation.

12:31.833 --> 12:33.791
What did you do?

12:35.166 --> 12:37.083
Sorry, Muscles.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.166
Huh?

12:48.541 --> 12:50.833
- What's happening?
- It's the Empire.

12:52.416 --> 12:55.416
Take the mining tunnels to the spaceport
and find Echo.

12:55.416 --> 12:56.500
I'll get Wrecker.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.833
But you're injured.
You can't fight them alone.

13:00.958 --> 13:04.625
Omega, you and AZI need to go.
That's an order!

13:16.083 --> 13:19.375
Omega? We must keep moving.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.833
I can't do it, AZI.

13:22.416 --> 13:24.666
I already lost Tech.

13:24.666 --> 13:26.291
I'm not gonna lose them too.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.333
Come on.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.458
That's not very strategic, Hunter.

13:54.791 --> 13:58.250
You don't need to use your enhanced senses
to know you're outnumbered.

14:02.791 --> 14:06.666
The Empire thanks you for your assistance.

14:12.916 --> 14:15.916
Our business is done. Leave.

14:30.916 --> 14:33.791
I do not agree
with this course of action, Omega.

14:33.791 --> 14:35.250
It is not safe.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.333
It will be if you keep quiet.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.666
Please,
consider your next move very carefully.

14:43.708 --> 14:46.291
I would hate for this to end poorly
for both of you.

14:48.291 --> 14:50.791
Here is how this is going to go.

14:51.458 --> 14:55.083
You will lower your blaster
and hand over Omega.

14:55.625 --> 14:59.291
And I will allow you to keep breathing.

14:59.291 --> 15:02.291
Omega's not going anywhere with you.

15:02.291 --> 15:03.583
Oh.

15:03.583 --> 15:06.875
Well, who knew clones are so paternal?

15:08.333 --> 15:09.333
Fascinating.

15:12.250 --> 15:16.041
I was saddened to learn
of your friend's demise.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.250
What was his name?

15:21.083 --> 15:23.250
Oh, yes. Tech.

15:30.750 --> 15:33.291
I'm afraid this was all I could salvage.

15:34.875 --> 15:36.458
Consider it a gift.

15:43.166 --> 15:48.875
To lose one of your own, it must
weigh heavily on you as their leader.

15:53.250 --> 15:58.416
And if you don't lower the blaster now,
you will lose yet another.

16:19.458 --> 16:20.625
Wise decision.

16:30.916 --> 16:33.500
Sir, the girl's not in the office.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.458
She's long gone.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.541
Like I said,
Omega's not going anywhere with you.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.333
Hmm.

16:46.583 --> 16:47.583
We'll see.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.083
AZI, find Echo.

17:07.583 --> 17:09.583
I'll try to stall them as long as I can.

17:25.666 --> 17:27.833
Lower your weapons.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.208
Hello, Omega.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.041
We were just talking about you.

17:35.041 --> 17:37.166
Let them go!

17:37.166 --> 17:38.666
Omega, run!

17:39.166 --> 17:41.291
I won't let them take you.

17:42.916 --> 17:45.208
How about an exchange?

17:50.916 --> 17:54.125
If you come with me,
your friends will live.

17:54.791 --> 17:56.375
I don't believe you.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.333
I did not come here for them, Omega.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.416
I came to return you to Nala Se.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.541
She needs your help.

18:04.541 --> 18:07.333
He's lying. They killed the Kaminoans.

18:07.333 --> 18:08.791
Incorrect.

18:08.791 --> 18:12.208
Nala Se is alive and well cared for.

18:13.208 --> 18:14.708
As you will be.

18:14.708 --> 18:16.458
I'm not going with you.

18:19.083 --> 18:20.416
Omega, look out!

18:24.666 --> 18:29.833
Scour the city. When you find
the third clone, send them back to Eriadu.

18:30.791 --> 18:34.916
Governor Tarkin wishes
to question you personally.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.250
Troopers are everywhere.
We cannot sneak past them.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.750
Then we do the opposite.

19:09.958 --> 19:11.875
- Echo?
- Gotta be Echo.

19:50.625 --> 19:52.791
- Where's Omega?
- That Imperial took her.

19:52.791 --> 19:56.041
It was Hemlock.
We've gotta stop his shuttle from leaving.

20:14.833 --> 20:15.875
Whoa!

20:29.833 --> 20:31.791
Hunter, we need to go!

20:31.791 --> 20:33.125
Get to the <i>Marauder</i>!

21:14.625 --> 21:17.041
There was no way to track Hemlock's ship.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.541
He could have taken Omega anywhere.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.166
We are going to get her back.

21:36.625 --> 21:40.625
And we don't stop searching until we do.

22:12.416 --> 22:14.583
Have Emerie see to her injuries.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.666
Yes, Doctor.

22:21.875 --> 22:23.291
Why did they bring me here?

22:39.000 --> 22:42.625
Your prime minister mentioned you had
an attachment to the young clone,

22:43.875 --> 22:45.208
so I've returned her to you.

22:45.708 --> 22:50.291
Perhaps now you will reconsider working
on the Emperor's project.

22:51.291 --> 22:54.916
What he seeks is not possible.

22:54.916 --> 22:56.333
Make it possible.

22:57.791 --> 23:04.125
If you refuse or fail,
Omega will suffer the consequences.

23:14.541 --> 23:15.541
Wait here.

23:30.333 --> 23:31.333
Crosshair!

23:34.541 --> 23:35.541
Crosshair?

23:36.708 --> 23:37.708
Crosshair?

23:44.625 --> 23:46.083
You must be Omega.

23:46.708 --> 23:48.416
What did you do to Crosshair?

23:48.958 --> 23:50.041
He's recovering.

23:50.958 --> 23:54.458
I tried to warn him what would happen
if he did not cooperate with the doctor.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.625
I want to talk to Nala Se.

23:58.291 --> 24:02.875
Ironic.
You trust the Kaminoan, but not me.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.416
I don't know you.

24:06.041 --> 24:07.041
No?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.416
You might know me better than you think.

24:14.708 --> 24:16.791
We're sisters, Omega.
