00:01.000 --> 00:02.415
[shouting] We're all hungry!

00:02.416 --> 00:05.207
Because credits are scarce,
there's never enough.

00:05.208 --> 00:06.708
<i>What if there were?</i>

00:07.208 --> 00:09.249
An Old Republic Mint...

00:09.250 --> 00:10.707
What's a mint again?

00:10.708 --> 00:12.457
[Fern] It's where they make money.

00:12.458 --> 00:14.457
[Brutus] This is your last chance, Silvo.

00:14.458 --> 00:17.791
If there's no treasure,
you're going for a little ride.

00:21.458 --> 00:23.540
- [Wim] Hey! Wait up!
- [Fern] Help! Down here! Help!

00:23.541 --> 00:24.707
It's too bad.

00:24.708 --> 00:27.250
'Cause I have the coordinates home
and everything.

00:27.750 --> 00:29.708
So now we just need
to climb back to our ship.

00:30.625 --> 00:32.166
- [rumbling]
- [all screaming]

00:33.083 --> 00:35.415
- How much longer until we can take off?
- Too long.

00:35.416 --> 00:37.207
[Fern] We have to blow it off the hull.

00:37.208 --> 00:38.625
Uh, how do we do that?

00:45.333 --> 00:47.624
Claimsies on the new ship!

00:47.625 --> 00:49.207
I told you to wait.

00:49.208 --> 00:51.457
It's just a way to get a message
through the Barrier.

00:51.458 --> 00:53.749
We can help the kids
without saying anything specific

00:53.750 --> 00:55.374
about At Attin's location.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.082
We have to do something.

00:57.083 --> 00:58.375
What's the plan?

01:03.083 --> 01:05.083
[♪ gentle music playing]

01:23.125 --> 01:25.125

01:28.166 --> 01:30.166

01:41.291 --> 01:42.291
[Maree] I'm ready.

01:46.333 --> 01:47.540
[Fara softly] Be careful.

01:47.541 --> 01:50.125
Barrier access codes
are not easy to come by.

01:51.250 --> 01:52.541
[exhales]

01:55.250 --> 01:56.790
Still need that other part.

01:56.791 --> 01:58.249
[twigs snapping]

01:58.250 --> 01:59.665
[Wendle] Oh, there you are.

01:59.666 --> 02:00.750
[Maree] Finally.

02:01.458 --> 02:03.874
Sorry. Uh, here's the transmitter.

02:03.875 --> 02:06.499
But will that thing
really get through the Barrier?

02:06.500 --> 02:08.625
- [rustling]
- Did you hear that?

02:10.500 --> 02:11.958
Probably a tree-sucker.

02:16.041 --> 02:18.750
- There. That'll do it.
- [rustling continues]

02:21.375 --> 02:22.875
I have a bad--

02:24.125 --> 02:25.457
- [gasps]
- [Safety Droid] Attention.

02:25.458 --> 02:27.499
You have an unauthorized
communication device.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.916
- Step away or you will be stunned.
- [beeping]

02:31.583 --> 02:33.500
[whispers] I'm gonna grab it and run.

02:35.666 --> 02:36.666
[Garree] Nooma!

02:37.833 --> 02:38.832
[Maree] She'll be fine. Run!

02:38.833 --> 02:41.750
[Safety Droid] You will be stunned
for your own safety.

02:42.791 --> 02:44.165
[gasps]

02:44.166 --> 02:45.375
[♪ dramatic music playing]

02:52.166 --> 02:55.666
[Safety Droid] Set down
the communicator or you will be stunned.

02:58.583 --> 03:01.583
You will be stunned for your own safety.

03:05.625 --> 03:09.833
Undersecretary Fara,
set down the communicator.

03:14.666 --> 03:18.166
Set down the communicator
or you will be stunned.

03:25.041 --> 03:26.958
[distant] Set down the communicator.

[Neel] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.624
- [Fern giggles]
- Nice shot, Fern.

04:15.625 --> 04:18.375
According to these instruments,
we should be home soon.

04:18.958 --> 04:21.124
You hear that? Wim, come here!

04:21.125 --> 04:22.750
Told you I'd get us home!

04:27.583 --> 04:28.750
What's wrong?

04:33.708 --> 04:34.916
[Wim sighs] Nothing.

04:38.666 --> 04:40.416
Maybe they'll let us keep the ship.

04:41.791 --> 04:43.000
[Wim] Yeah, right.

04:45.416 --> 04:46.833
We could land out in the woods.

04:48.250 --> 04:51.082
We could hike back,
say we got lost this whole time.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.290
No.

04:52.291 --> 04:56.583
Once we get back, then everything
goes back to the way it was.

04:57.708 --> 05:00.250
[sighs] I still have to take Assessment.

05:02.875 --> 05:06.749
I never should've pushed
this stupid button in the first place.

05:06.750 --> 05:07.958
[KB] Don't say that.

05:08.541 --> 05:10.957
Yeah, it was a really fun adventure.

05:10.958 --> 05:13.332
Half the time I was about to die.

05:13.333 --> 05:15.750
But that's what a real adventure is like.

05:17.916 --> 05:19.083
I'm glad you did.

05:21.625 --> 05:23.250
[chuckles softly] It'll be fine.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.458
You'll see.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.750
[♪ foreboding music playing]

05:42.833 --> 05:45.332
[Brutus growls] This is At Attin?

05:45.333 --> 05:47.790
It's a toxic maelstrom.

05:47.791 --> 05:49.165
Is this right, Chaelt?

05:49.166 --> 05:52.166
- Position's correct, Cap'n.
- [Brutus laughs]

05:54.083 --> 05:58.165
[growls] This At Attin of yours don't look
like a treasure planet to me.

05:58.166 --> 06:01.583
Any ship that goes in there
will be destroyed.

06:02.916 --> 06:04.499
Prepare the airlock.

- [Brutus growls]

06:20.666 --> 06:23.250
If it isn't in front of your face,
it doesn't exist?

06:25.083 --> 06:27.208
It's a trick, you fools.

06:28.791 --> 06:32.332
[scoffs] At Attin's been hidden
for hundreds of years.

06:32.333 --> 06:35.625
You expect it to be just floating
in the open?

06:36.458 --> 06:38.374
It's camouflaged!

06:38.375 --> 06:39.707
A whole planet?

06:39.708 --> 06:43.415
Is that what you came here for, men?
More fables?

06:43.416 --> 06:44.916
[pirates exclaiming]

06:46.625 --> 06:49.958
Tak Rennod was here.

06:50.833 --> 06:52.041
I'm telling you.

06:52.875 --> 06:56.125
33, check the log.

06:56.708 --> 06:57.915
Aye.

06:57.916 --> 06:59.915
According to Captain Rennod,

06:59.916 --> 07:04.457
the real treasure planet be hidden
inside an en-endless storm.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.083
[thunder rumbling]

07:06.958 --> 07:10.291
[chuckling] It's hidden. Inside.

07:15.416 --> 07:19.165
[laughs] It's hidden inside.

07:19.166 --> 07:21.500
I'll bet my life on it.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.375
You give me a fighter, I'll fly in myself.

07:26.875 --> 07:28.707
I'll take that bet.

07:28.708 --> 07:30.707
But you're not going anywhere.

07:30.708 --> 07:33.125
One of my crew will fly into the storm.

07:33.958 --> 07:35.915
Send out a volunteer.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.874

- Wait! No, listen!

08:30.375 --> 08:33.332
- [pirates clamoring]
- Listen! It's a defensive grid--

08:33.333 --> 08:37.874
[grunts] Of course it is,
to hide the treasure!

08:37.875 --> 08:40.124

08:44.583 --> 08:47.290
- No. 33.

08:47.291 --> 08:49.707
What did Rennod say
about getting through this thing?

08:49.708 --> 08:51.582
Enough talk. Airlock him.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.208
No, you kill me, and you're throwing away

08:53.458 --> 08:55.457
the greatest treasure
the galaxy has ever known!

08:55.458 --> 08:57.040
- Let me out!
- Release the airlock

08:57.041 --> 08:58.290
or you lot'll be joining him!

08:58.291 --> 09:00.000
- Nah... No, no, no!
- Wait!

09:01.083 --> 09:03.207
Something on sensors, Captain.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.166
A ship out of hyperspace.

09:10.916 --> 09:12.458
Let's see it.

09:13.416 --> 09:15.707
[Vane] Ah.
Look at those old thermal vents.

09:15.708 --> 09:17.332
Don't make 'em like that no more.

09:17.333 --> 09:20.290
[SM-33] Aye.
Looks much different without its armor.

09:20.291 --> 09:22.832
[Brutus] It's an antique. Fire cannons!

09:22.833 --> 09:26.666
I've got it! I've got it!
I've got it! I've got it!

09:28.166 --> 09:29.500

09:31.583 --> 09:32.875
The ship's the key.

15:06.166 --> 15:07.707
We need to take the ship back.

15:07.708 --> 15:08.791
But how?

15:10.833 --> 15:11.833
We need a plan.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.332
We can trick Jod.

15:14.333 --> 15:16.457
We know he's greedy.
I mean, maybe we can even--

15:29.458 --> 15:32.707
[Jod] Always best to have
a hostage. Chain 'em up.

15:32.708 --> 15:34.332
- [Wim grunts]
- Aye, Captain Silvo.

15:34.333 --> 15:38.832
I don't care how many fake names you have,
because we know that you're a liar!

15:38.833 --> 15:41.375
And this is our ship
'cause we found it first!

15:43.166 --> 15:44.624
[Jod] Well, now it's mine.

15:44.625 --> 15:47.915
Actually, since you're currently
captain of the frigate,

15:47.916 --> 15:50.458
this vessel remains unattested.

15:52.291 --> 15:53.290
[Jod] Excuse me?

15:53.291 --> 15:55.124
By the Pirate Code,

15:55.125 --> 15:59.333
a captain can lay claim
to one vessel and only one.

16:00.916 --> 16:02.999
I-I call claimsies-- [muffled grunts]

16:03.000 --> 16:04.083
[Jod] I claim this ship.

16:05.791 --> 16:08.083
I claim the <i>Onyx Cinder.</i>

16:08.583 --> 16:13.832
I am the captain of this ship,
and you all take orders from me.

16:13.833 --> 16:15.083
Aye, Captain Jod.

16:16.375 --> 16:18.332
- I call unclaimsies.
- [gasps]

16:18.333 --> 16:19.540
[Jod] What?

16:19.541 --> 16:22.749
I call unclaimsies
and claim it for kids only!

16:22.750 --> 16:25.625
33, get these pirates off our ship.

16:28.416 --> 16:30.332
I'm afraid it doesn't work
like that.

16:30.333 --> 16:31.708
[groans]

16:34.083 --> 16:36.416
Aye, but it be close enough.

16:58.333 --> 17:00.958
- Aye, aye, Captain Fern. It'd be my honor.
- [children laugh]

17:07.333 --> 17:09.083
[pirates] Oh! Get them!

17:17.666 --> 17:20.374
Captain, why did you send out
the <i>Onyx Cinder?</i>

17:20.375 --> 17:21.999
- Captain?
- [grunts]

17:22.000 --> 17:23.249

It would appear the defensive grid
is still active.

18:12.375 --> 18:13.540
But we'll be safe?

18:13.541 --> 18:16.040
Aye, that was Cap'n Rennod's genius!

18:16.041 --> 18:20.708

18:48.541 --> 18:51.082
Yes! It worked! We're alive!

18:51.083 --> 18:54.833

it's an At Attin ship!

- We made it.

Just like on Hayna's planet.

My mom totally lied on that call.

19:33.750 --> 19:36.000
We're gonna be in so much trouble.

19:36.666 --> 19:37.708
But...

19:38.958 --> 19:41.040
I don't even care anymore.

19:41.041 --> 19:42.125
[Jod] But you should.

Well, well, well, back again, are we?

Stay where you are, kids.
I'll handle this.

20:33.541 --> 20:34.750
We made it through.

20:35.541 --> 20:40.000
At Attin is on the inside,

Honestly, it is unbearable!

What exactly are you going to do?

21:36.833 --> 21:37.833
You're all weak.

21:40.375 --> 21:43.541
Weak, sheltered, spoiled children.

21:44.500 --> 21:48.874
I have got a terrible headache
and zero patience left,

21:48.875 --> 21:51.750
so be quiet and let me think.

21:53.375 --> 21:54.915
We're gonna land.

21:54.916 --> 21:56.708
I'm gonna contact the frigate.

21:58.250 --> 22:01.000
And you lot are not going to say a word.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.333
Not one word. You understand?
You're gonna follow my lead.

22:06.375 --> 22:11.250

that any of you are thinking otherwise...

I will.

You are all in violation
of At Attin's security protocols.

23:12.708 --> 23:16.541
Why did you release this
communications device through the Barrier?

23:17.416 --> 23:19.082
It's because you left us no choice.

23:19.083 --> 23:21.040
We did what we had
to to help our children.

23:21.041 --> 23:24.957
The problem is, you droids don't listen.

23:24.958 --> 23:27.082

Yes, of course I am.

And these are four waifs
I found along the way.

The Supervisor, yes.
