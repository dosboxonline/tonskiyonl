-Jump.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.076
[cast members shouting]

01:28.881 --> 01:30.090
This one is heavy!

01:30.174 --> 01:31.216
Over here.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.509
Need some help.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.513
[soldier] Be prepared!

01:40.601 --> 01:43.770
[director] And cut! Back to one.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.986
I'm still not entirely sure
how to…

01:51.069 --> 01:53.947
You'll wake up very sore
tomorrow, I would say. Yeah.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.408
Your volume's on,
you'll be able to hear everything.

01:58.202 --> 02:00.204
[chattering]

02:11.924 --> 02:13.759
[sobbing, breathing heavily]

03:15.946 --> 03:17.239
I really want to.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.201
But, you know--

03:21.285 --> 03:22.286
You're scared.

03:23.829 --> 03:25.038
Anyone would be.

03:27.249 --> 03:30.627
Do you really think
speaking out might stop him?

03:31.336 --> 03:36.175
I think it's really important for
voters to have this information

03:36.258 --> 03:39.052
as they determine whether
he's fit to be president.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.680
What if he decides to sue?

03:42.848 --> 03:45.517
Would The New York Times
be willing to help me?

03:46.059 --> 03:49.479
News organizations
can't provide legal support.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.481
You'd be on your own.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.017
[reporter] Hi, Rachel?

04:27.643 --> 04:30.646
And you're definitely going to write
about Jessica Leeds?

04:31.230 --> 04:34.233
Jessica is absolutely
on board 100%.

04:35.526 --> 04:36.527
[Rachel] Okay.

04:37.694 --> 04:41.073
I'll do it. I'll go on the record
and say what he did to me.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.410
You will? That's great, Rachel.

04:46.662 --> 04:47.829
Thank you.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.461
[reporter on TV] …in New Hampshire,

04:54.545 --> 04:58.257
asking voters there to reelect
the Republican senator

as a check and balance.

-Violet, no.

Baby, Momma's gotta go to work.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.150
You're gonna stay with Daddy, okay?

05:17.234 --> 05:18.735
Violet. Violet.

05:18.819 --> 05:21.780
Mom's gonna go to work. Come on.
Let's go see your animals.

05:21.864 --> 05:23.949
-Come on.
-Talia, you're my hero.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.826
[Talia]
Wanna show me your elephant?

05:30.581 --> 05:32.457
[person chattering on podcast]

05:40.591 --> 05:43.760
[news reporter on TV] We didn't
find any evidence of evil intent.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.679
You can't obstruct justice there.

05:46.430 --> 05:47.431
[reporter] Morning, Jodi.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.434
[chattering]

05:57.107 --> 05:59.985
[news anchor] They might not be as
enthusiastic as they were four years ago,

06:00.068 --> 06:01.195
but we know where they are.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.905
We know where young people are. We know…

06:02.988 --> 06:05.324
Okay, just give him a call.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.745
-Were you sick again?
-[reporter] Yeah.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.997
It's meant to stop
after the first trimester.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.583
-You should probably get some sleep.
-Mmm.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.169
Mmm.

06:17.252 --> 06:19.046
I will as soon as
I get a response.

06:19.922 --> 06:21.131
From Trump's people?

06:21.215 --> 06:22.966
What happens
if they don't respond?

06:23.050 --> 06:26.011
They will,
but we can't publish until they do.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.430
[speaking Hebrew]

06:36.355 --> 06:37.689
[cell phone buzzes]

06:37.773 --> 06:39.775
-Hello?
-[Trump] Is this Megan Twohey?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.569
Yes, Mr. Trump.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.658
I do not know these women. They are lying.

06:47.741 --> 06:51.328
And if I did something to them,
why didn't they go to the police?

06:51.411 --> 06:54.081
Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks
didn't ever say that they knew you,

06:54.164 --> 06:55.749
just that they were chance encounters.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.085
The New York Times
has concocted these stories,

06:58.168 --> 07:00.254
and if you publish them, I will sue.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.631
What about the leaked
Access Hollywood tape?

07:02.714 --> 07:04.132
Do you do those things?

07:04.216 --> 07:06.426
I don't do it.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.971
I don't do it.
It was locker-room talk.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.014
And, Mr. Trump, Miss Utah,

07:11.098 --> 07:13.183
she claimed you
forcibly kissed her more than once

07:13.267 --> 07:14.935
when you owned
the Miss America pageant.

07:15.018 --> 07:19.314
She's lying. You are disgusting.
You are a disgusting human being.

[CBS news anchor]
Several women speaking out,

07:27.114 --> 07:30.576
accusing Donald Trump
of touching them inappropriately.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.036
Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks,

07:33.120 --> 07:38.292
telling The New York Times they were both
groped or kissed by Trump without consent.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.711
[CNN news anchor] …for a company
located in Trump Tower,

07:40.794 --> 07:43.422
claims the billionaire kissed her
on the cheeks and the mouth.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.050
[gasps] Oh, my God.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.555
Fuck. Rachel, I'm so sorry.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.808
[Rachel] I went on the record,
you published, and this is what happened.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.561
[Megan] Yeah, I'm so sorry.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.314
I was prepared, you know?
But not for this.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.065
An envelope full of shit?

08:02.649 --> 08:04.151
Was there anything
written on it?

08:04.234 --> 08:05.777
No. What can I do?

08:05.861 --> 08:07.738
-I can't even leave the house.
-Oh, yeah, fuck.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.657
Well, you need to write everything down.

08:10.741 --> 08:15.787
Tape any conversations or voice mails.
You need to document any threats you get--

08:15.871 --> 08:17.956
-Megan Twohey?
-Yeah. That's us.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.166
[Megan] I can't even imagine.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.335
Shit. Rachel, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

08:21.418 --> 08:23.420
I'll call you back.
I promise.

08:24.129 --> 08:26.965
-[sighs]
-[cell phone ringing]

08:27.049 --> 08:28.050
Rachel?

08:28.133 --> 08:30.886
[journalist] I'm calling
from Bill O'Reilly at Fox News.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.386
Are you a feminist?

08:32.471 --> 08:33.804
[sighs]

08:35.599 --> 08:37.392
Are you fucking kidding me?

08:38.268 --> 08:40.854
[chuckles] I'm sorry. Hi. Hi.

08:40.938 --> 08:43.899
-The final push till Election Day.
-[cell phone chimes]

08:43.982 --> 08:46.193
And as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump
make their closing arguments…

08:46.276 --> 08:49.446
-Bill O'Reilly's talking about you.
-…the race has tightened even more.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.156
[typing]

08:53.534 --> 08:55.786
[O'Reilly] The Factor
asked Miss Twohey to appear this evening.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.539
She declined, no surprise.
This is a tough forum.

08:58.622 --> 09:00.165
She and Mr. Barbaro did appear

09:00.249 --> 09:02.042
-on other cable outlets…
-[Megan sighs]

09:02.125 --> 09:03.752
…friendly to liberal points of view.

09:03.836 --> 09:07.297
We asked Miss Twohey
if she herself is a feminist,

09:07.381 --> 09:09.883
-both on the phone and in writing.
-[sighs]

09:09.967 --> 09:11.969
She declined to answer
in both cases.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.428
I'm gonna go get some noodles.

09:13.512 --> 09:15.764
[O'Reilly] Here's what she said
about the article yesterday.

09:15.848 --> 09:19.184
[Megan] You know, our story
is the experience of many women,

09:19.268 --> 09:20.477
going back over the years.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.656
[cell phone ringing]

09:34.241 --> 09:35.242
Hello?

09:35.742 --> 09:39.955
[intimidator] I am going to rape you
and murder you,

09:40.038 --> 09:41.999
and dump your body in the Hudson River.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.501
[line clicks]

09:48.964 --> 09:51.675
[CNN news anchor 1] This night
is turning out to be a real nail-biter.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.468
[CNN news anchor 2] CNN can report

09:53.552 --> 09:57.973
that Hillary Clinton has called
Donald Trump to concede the race.

09:58.640 --> 10:02.519
[CNN news anchor 1] CNN projects
Donald Trump wins the presidency.

10:11.653 --> 10:14.448
[reporter] Breaking news on Bill O'Reilly.
Let's go to Julia Boorstin. Julia.

10:14.531 --> 10:17.659
[Julia] That's right. Fox has just
announced that Bill O'Reilly is out,

10:17.743 --> 10:20.704
saying, quote, "After a thorough
and careful review of the allegations,

10:20.787 --> 10:22.497
the company and Bill O'Reilly have agreed

10:22.581 --> 10:25.584
that Bill O'Reilly will not be returning
to the Fox News Channel."

10:25.667 --> 10:31.465
Of course, this follows the boycott of
over 50 advertisers of The O'Reilly Factor

10:31.548 --> 10:35.511
after a New York Times report
of sexual harassment allegations

10:35.594 --> 10:40.140
and the report that Fox and O'Reilly
together spent about $13 million

10:40.224 --> 10:43.560
to settle those allegations
from five different women.

10:43.644 --> 10:44.686
So, the story…

10:44.770 --> 10:46.647
-Job well done, Emily.
-Thanks, Dean.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.565
And you, Mike.
Excellent reporting.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.776
[Julia] …not be returning
to his top-rated cable show.

10:50.859 --> 10:53.612
Are we talking solely
corporate misuse of power?

10:53.695 --> 10:55.614
No.
We're talking all workplaces

10:55.697 --> 10:57.699
where sexual harassment
might happen.

10:57.783 --> 10:59.826
Also, let's look for the enablers.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.996
Fox kept O'Reilly on for quite some time
after our story broke.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.456
And for decades before that.

11:04.540 --> 11:07.376
The network only ousted him
when the advertisers jumped ship.

11:07.459 --> 11:09.795
Let's interrogate the whole system.

11:09.878 --> 11:13.966
Why is sexual harassment so pervasive
and so hard to address?

11:14.508 --> 11:16.051
[chattering]

11:16.969 --> 11:18.387
Hey, do you guys have a minute?

11:18.470 --> 11:19.471
Sure.

11:21.807 --> 11:24.977
So, I spoke to Shaunna Thomas,

11:25.060 --> 11:27.354
the head of UltraViolet,
a feminist group.

11:27.437 --> 11:30.774
She said the wrongdoing in Hollywood
is overwhelming.

11:30.858 --> 11:32.901
She's in touch with an actress,
Rose McGowan,

11:32.985 --> 11:35.612
who has tweeted about
being raped by a producer.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.031
Thomas says it's Harvey Weinstein.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.450
And that McGowan is now
working on a book about it.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.703
Wasn't he charged with something
a couple years ago?

11:42.786 --> 11:43.787
Yeah. Um…

11:44.913 --> 11:47.958
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez,
an Italian model.

11:48.041 --> 11:51.003
She claimed Weinstein groped her
in a business meeting.

11:51.086 --> 11:54.006
The NYPD investigated it,
but he was never charged.

11:54.089 --> 11:55.674
Talk to Rose McGowan.

11:55.757 --> 11:58.051
Try to talk to other actresses
he's worked with.

11:58.135 --> 12:01.013
Yeah, and I'll try to reach ex-employees.

12:04.183 --> 12:05.642
Hi. My name is Jodi Kantor.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.895
I'm an investigative reporter
for The New York Times.

12:07.978 --> 12:10.731
We're looking into sexual harassment
in the workplace.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.524
I believe you were an employee at Miramax

12:12.608 --> 12:14.943
and worked for Harvey Weinstein
in the '90s.

12:15.027 --> 12:16.862
[former assistant] Are you recording this?

12:16.945 --> 12:17.946
No, absolutely not.

12:18.030 --> 12:20.908
I won't quote from this conversation
without your permission.

12:20.991 --> 12:23.785
But in your time as an assistant,
were you aware of any instances

12:23.869 --> 12:28.332
in which Harvey Weinstein treated women
inappropriately or crossed a line?

12:28.415 --> 12:30.709
[chuckles] Did Harvey cross a line?

12:30.792 --> 12:32.127
-[scoffs]
-[line clicks]

12:33.962 --> 12:35.881
Would you like to hear
her heartbeat?

12:35.964 --> 12:37.257
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.552
[heartbeat thumping]

12:41.762 --> 12:44.139
[Jodi] Mary,
thanks so much for calling me back.

12:44.223 --> 12:45.933
[Mary] Who have you talked to?

12:46.016 --> 12:49.853
I can't tell you names,
just as I would never divulge yours,

12:49.937 --> 12:52.356
but if you wanted to
share anything that you know,

12:52.439 --> 12:54.107
that would be so helpful.

12:54.191 --> 12:57.152
I don't think people
will want to talk.

12:57.236 --> 12:58.237
Sorry.

12:58.320 --> 12:59.655
[line clicks]

13:06.328 --> 13:07.579
[laughs]

13:07.663 --> 13:10.832
[Jodi] Ms. Godrèche, thank you so much
for responding.

13:10.916 --> 13:11.959
[Godrèche] Before you continue,

13:12.042 --> 13:14.878
I've talked about Weinstein in the past,
but in private.

13:14.962 --> 13:17.798
My immigration lawyer
does not want me to be involved.

13:17.881 --> 13:19.258
[line clicks]

13:20.801 --> 13:22.469
Involved in what?

13:23.554 --> 13:25.138
[line ringing]

13:26.181 --> 13:28.517
-Hello?
-Oh, hi, Rose.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.646
Um, this is Jodi Kantor
from The New York Times.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.273
I wrote you an email.

13:34.773 --> 13:38.193
Shaunna Thomas suggested you might be
willing to have a conversation with me

13:38.277 --> 13:41.446
about Hollywood,
and specifically Harvey Weinstein.

13:41.530 --> 13:42.865
Are you writing about him?

13:42.948 --> 13:44.157
Yes, I am.

13:44.241 --> 13:47.369
Look, I don't feel that inclined
to talk to you about it.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.829
[Jodi] Could I ask why not?

13:48.912 --> 13:52.749
I've been treated quite shabbily
by your paper numerous times,

13:52.833 --> 13:56.295
and I believe the root of it
is sexism.

13:57.171 --> 13:59.173
I'm sorry that
was your experience.

13:59.256 --> 14:02.426
I've talked in the past,
and nothing happened.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.761
I spoke at a political meeting recently,

14:04.845 --> 14:08.223
and The New York Times put it
in the style section.

14:08.307 --> 14:12.227
It does damage to shout,
and no one listens.

14:12.311 --> 14:15.522
I'm investigating systemic sexism
in Hollywood.

14:15.606 --> 14:17.649
How many pages have you got?

14:17.733 --> 14:18.942
No.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.696
I put myself on the line before,
and it made no difference.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.908
I've written about the workplace
at Amazon, Starbucks,

14:25.991 --> 14:29.828
and Harvard Business School,
and change did happen.

14:29.912 --> 14:33.832
They reformed their policies
as a direct result of the Times articles.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.335
But if you don't wanna talk, I understand.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.504
And good luck with your book.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.506
Thank you. Goodbye.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.301
[Jodi's husband] I spoke to Dad.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.304
He sounded worse.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.266
I gotta go see him soon.

14:52.267 --> 14:55.145
Could you go for a long weekend?
You could take the girls.

14:55.229 --> 14:57.314
I could take Talia,
but not both of them.

15:04.029 --> 15:05.614
I'm having an affair…

15:07.074 --> 15:09.284
with a very famous actress.

15:10.953 --> 15:12.371
You want her number?

15:15.791 --> 15:17.292
[chuckles]

15:18.418 --> 15:20.420
-She's so hot.
-[laughs]

15:21.505 --> 15:23.048
This looks beautiful.

15:23.549 --> 15:24.967
You'd really like her.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.426
[laughs]

15:26.510 --> 15:30.764
"I am a nasty woman."

15:30.848 --> 15:33.433
[crowd cheers]

15:33.517 --> 15:36.770
"I'm not as nasty as using little girls
like Pokémon

15:36.854 --> 15:38.856
before their bodies have even developed."

15:38.939 --> 15:41.191
-Is that Ashley Judd?
-Yeah.

15:42.401 --> 15:46.280
She wrote about being sexually harassed
by a producer in the '90s.

15:46.363 --> 15:50.075
She doesn't name him,
but she describes him as

15:50.158 --> 15:54.246
"one of our industry's
most famous admired/reviled bosses."

15:54.329 --> 15:57.165
[Ashley]
…"homophobia, sexual assault,

15:57.249 --> 16:00.127
transphobia, white supremacy,

16:00.210 --> 16:03.297
-misogyny, ignorance, white privilege."
-[Violet crying]

16:03.380 --> 16:05.174
-I'll go?
-I'll get her.

16:05.257 --> 16:06.967
-[Talia] Mom!
-[crying continues]

16:07.050 --> 16:08.385
[chuckles]

16:08.468 --> 16:09.970
-We'll both go.
-Yeah.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.683
I don't know if I can do this. [cries]

16:16.935 --> 16:18.478
[Megan's husband] You need to rest.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.732
Can you try to sleep, maybe?

16:23.650 --> 16:24.985
I don't wanna be…

16:27.362 --> 16:30.991
I just have this constant sense of dread.
[cries]

16:31.074 --> 16:32.534
You're tired.

16:33.118 --> 16:34.995
Your body's exhausted.

16:35.078 --> 16:36.079
[Megan exhales]

16:37.206 --> 16:39.291
I think I would know if it was just that.

16:44.463 --> 16:45.672
[cell phone buzzing]

16:45.756 --> 16:46.757
Mom.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.595
[buzzing continues]

16:55.265 --> 16:56.266
Hello?

16:56.350 --> 16:59.061
It's Rose. McGowan.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.646
Rose, hi.

17:00.729 --> 17:03.524
It's not just him you should be after.

17:03.607 --> 17:06.484
There's an entire machine.
A supply chain.

17:06.568 --> 17:09.029
Of abusers in Hollywood?

17:09.112 --> 17:10.113
Right.

17:10.696 --> 17:14.992
They're worldwide,
wherever movies are being made or sold.

17:15.077 --> 17:18.539
Each studio does the victim-shaming
and payouts.

17:19.122 --> 17:22.084
If white men could have a playground,
this would be it.

17:25.087 --> 17:26.505
Do people know about it?

17:27.047 --> 17:28.715
[chuckles] Of course.

17:28.799 --> 17:31.218
I told a lot of people
what happened to me.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.596
At the Sundance Film Festival?

17:34.680 --> 17:35.848
I was 23.

17:35.931 --> 17:38.767
I was doing all these brilliant
independent films.

17:38.851 --> 17:41.353
I was just incredibly hopeful.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.437
[door opens]

17:43.105 --> 17:45.399
-Hi.
-And then I went to that hotel room.

17:45.983 --> 17:47.568
[door closes]

17:47.651 --> 17:49.027
[Jodi's husband] Talia?

17:49.111 --> 17:50.404
I'm here.

17:51.154 --> 17:55.409
[Rose] He was on a sofa,
talking loudly on his phone.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.827
I waited.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.121
And then we talked about projects,

17:59.204 --> 18:03.876
and he suddenly said,
"I have a Jacuzzi in my room."

18:04.918 --> 18:09.506
I didn't know what the answer
to that was, so I just kept talking.

18:11.592 --> 18:14.344
We wrapped up,
and he said he'd walk me out.

18:14.428 --> 18:17.556
And I thought, "Well, that went well."

18:17.639 --> 18:19.641
It was my first big meeting.

18:20.309 --> 18:22.269
He walked behind me down a hallway,

18:22.978 --> 18:26.023
and then he said,
"This is the Jacuzzi room."

18:26.857 --> 18:30.861
And I looked in, and he pushed me inside.

18:31.695 --> 18:32.863
He stripped me.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.742
And he was suddenly naked.

18:37.826 --> 18:40.454
I left my body in some way.

18:41.914 --> 18:43.415
And he raped me.

18:44.917 --> 18:47.628
I went into survival mode to get out,

18:47.711 --> 18:49.671
and I faked an orgasm.

18:50.464 --> 18:52.007
He told me to get dressed.

18:52.841 --> 18:56.553
He left me messages telling me
I was his new special friend

18:56.637 --> 18:59.598
and that he'd done a lot
for other actresses.

19:00.390 --> 19:01.600
Did you report it?

19:02.351 --> 19:05.479
Can you see the law
taking my side on that?

19:08.357 --> 19:10.400
But you told other people?

19:10.484 --> 19:13.612
I told a lot of people,
and nobody did a thing.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.322
Nothing.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.577
Can I contact
the people you told?

19:21.286 --> 19:23.413
You told me this was private.

19:24.665 --> 19:28.168
He'll have spies watching you now,
as we speak.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.295
I hope you know that.

19:44.268 --> 19:47.187
[sighs]

19:52.067 --> 19:53.652
-[cell phone buzzing]
-[baby cooing]

19:53.735 --> 19:55.404
Shh, shh, shh…

19:56.655 --> 19:58.073
[whispers] Hello?

19:58.156 --> 20:00.033
Hey, Megan, this is Jodi Kantor.

20:00.117 --> 20:01.201
Is this a bad time?

20:01.827 --> 20:04.663
Uh… Um, no. It's fine.

20:04.746 --> 20:06.957
-[baby cooing]
-Oh, I hear her.

20:07.666 --> 20:08.876
How's it all going?

20:09.626 --> 20:11.670
[Megan] Yeah, it's, um…

20:11.753 --> 20:13.630
I just got her down.

20:15.924 --> 20:17.759
It's the toughest part, I think.

20:18.427 --> 20:19.761
Is it?

20:19.845 --> 20:21.388
I found it to be so.

20:22.097 --> 20:25.475
With my first daughter,
I had postpartum depression.

20:27.686 --> 20:30.772
Everyone's so excited, and it's like…

20:32.274 --> 20:33.525
you're just not there.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.236
Right.

20:39.031 --> 20:40.616
So, I got your email.

20:41.408 --> 20:42.492
How's it all going?

20:42.576 --> 20:44.536
Yeah… [chuckles]

20:45.162 --> 20:48.498
I feel like there are
a lot of women who have…

20:49.958 --> 20:52.336
been through something with him.

20:53.629 --> 20:56.590
But they find it hard to talk.

20:57.216 --> 21:00.552
And those who do talk to me
don't want to go on the record.

21:01.553 --> 21:02.971
In your previous stories,

21:04.139 --> 21:07.434
how did you persuade women
to tell you what had happened to them?

21:09.478 --> 21:10.938
Yeah, so…

21:12.314 --> 21:13.774
It's difficult.

21:13.857 --> 21:15.275
They're terrified.

21:16.235 --> 21:17.569
A case I made was,

21:18.570 --> 21:22.199
"You know, I can't change
what happened to you in the past,

21:22.908 --> 21:26.411
but together, we may be able
to use your experience

21:26.495 --> 21:28.205
to help protect other people."

21:29.623 --> 21:31.542
The truth, basically.

21:32.376 --> 21:33.377
But yeah.

21:33.877 --> 21:37.798
It's hard to ask women to talk.

21:39.174 --> 21:41.051
[chattering]

21:55.399 --> 22:00.028
[Ashley] Then he asked me
to meet him, uh, really early.

22:00.112 --> 22:03.031
And I had been up all night filming,
and I was tired.

22:03.782 --> 22:07.536
I went over to The Peninsula hotel,
and at reception, I asked,

22:07.619 --> 22:10.706
"Is Mr. Weinstein in The Belvedere
restaurant or is he on the patio?"

22:10.789 --> 22:13.959
And they said, "Go to his room."

22:15.460 --> 22:20.007
And I went upstairs,
and Harvey was in his bathrobe.

22:21.091 --> 22:23.635
And he asked
if he could give me a massage.

22:24.428 --> 22:26.430
"No," I said.

22:27.556 --> 22:31.602
And then, um, he asked me to help him
pick out his clothes for the day.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.939
He, you know, started asking
for all these things,

22:36.023 --> 22:39.026
increasingly more sexual,
getting closer and closer.

22:39.109 --> 22:42.154
And I just said no
so many different times,

22:42.237 --> 22:44.072
and in so many different ways.

22:45.115 --> 22:49.411
And then he finally, um,
asked me to watch him take a shower.

22:50.287 --> 22:52.456
And I said, "Harvey,

22:52.539 --> 22:55.959
when I win an Academy Award
in a Miramax movie,

22:57.169 --> 22:58.962
I will give you a blow job."

22:59.046 --> 23:00.923
And I got out of there fast.

23:01.590 --> 23:02.925
What did you do?

23:03.008 --> 23:05.636
I told my dad,
I told my agent,

23:05.719 --> 23:08.305
I told the people
with whom I was filming that night,

23:08.388 --> 23:09.973
and Harvey punished me.

23:10.057 --> 23:12.309
I mean, he blackballed my career

23:12.392 --> 23:14.561
because I had the wherewithal
to refuse him.

23:14.645 --> 23:16.230
How do you know that?

23:16.313 --> 23:19.525
I would be standing with other actresses,
and he would blank me.

23:19.608 --> 23:23.028
There were roles for which I was up
that I mysteriously did not get,

23:23.111 --> 23:25.531
and I know today
that it was Harvey making a phone call.

23:25.614 --> 23:29.785
You know, I did an article about it,
and nobody did anything.

23:29.868 --> 23:32.913
You didn't identify him,
but did industry people know

23:32.996 --> 23:34.748
who you were talking about
in your article?

23:34.831 --> 23:36.250
Absolutely.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.961
And the abuse came raining down
on me, not on him.

23:39.545 --> 23:42.297
You know at the Women's March
when I did the "Nasty Woman" poem?

23:42.381 --> 23:44.591
I lost a huge advertising gig

23:44.675 --> 23:48.512
because a small group of people complained
that I was quoting the president.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.973
He used that language
and got elected.

23:51.056 --> 23:53.934
I quoted him, and I got fired.

23:54.017 --> 23:57.020
It is decades later,
and it's still the same sexism.

23:57.104 --> 24:00.607
And, Jodi, I would make the same choices
all over again,

24:00.691 --> 24:02.317
but I also would like to work.

24:06.363 --> 24:08.824
[Jodi] Lisa Bloom, the lawyer,
she wrote to me.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.534
-Gloria Allred's daughter?
-Yeah.

24:10.617 --> 24:13.912
-Do you know her?
-No, but I assume she wants to help.

24:13.996 --> 24:15.539
I forwarded the email to Emily.

24:15.622 --> 24:17.583
[chattering]

24:22.921 --> 24:24.756
Jodi? Lisa Bloom.

24:25.591 --> 24:26.925
"Big announcement,

24:27.009 --> 24:31.597
my book Suspicion Nation is being produced
by Harvey Weinstein and Jay-Z."

24:31.680 --> 24:33.307
Weinstein is producing her book?

24:34.391 --> 24:39.313
Lisa Bloom, daughter of feminist icon,
is working with Harvey Weinstein.

24:39.396 --> 24:41.064
But why would she do that?

24:41.148 --> 24:43.233
How much do you get paid for a miniseries?

24:43.317 --> 24:45.986
He's got to be behind
Lisa reaching out to you.

24:46.069 --> 24:48.322
So Weinstein knows
what we're doing.

24:56.580 --> 24:57.581
Sorry.

25:01.376 --> 25:03.462
[Matt] Do you wanna keep going
with Trump?

25:04.338 --> 25:07.132
[Rebecca] Or you could join Jodi
and look into Harvey Weinstein?

25:07.216 --> 25:09.009
[chuckles]

25:10.552 --> 25:12.971
I worry about whether
it makes a difference.

25:14.097 --> 25:17.518
These women spoke out against Trump,
and he still became president.

25:17.601 --> 25:20.145
But in the wake of O'Reilly,
there's possibility.

25:20.229 --> 25:21.396
[cell phone buzzing]

25:21.480 --> 25:22.481
Sorry.

25:23.106 --> 25:25.526
Craig. I've been trying to reach you.

25:26.777 --> 25:27.986
You've gotta show up.

25:29.530 --> 25:30.531
How's your daughter?

25:30.614 --> 25:32.115
[chuckles] She's great.

25:34.451 --> 25:35.786
Oh, s-- Um…

25:37.037 --> 25:38.580
Sorry. I, um--

25:38.664 --> 25:40.916
Thank you for the gift you--

25:41.458 --> 25:42.584
Um…

25:43.293 --> 25:44.795
Is anything bothering you?

25:45.504 --> 25:47.714
Besides no sleep
and diapers everywhere.

25:49.883 --> 25:50.968
Are you okay?

25:53.971 --> 25:55.430
I've found it quite…

25:56.849 --> 25:57.850
difficult.

25:59.309 --> 26:00.310
I'm sorry.

26:01.645 --> 26:02.771
Will working help?

26:03.355 --> 26:04.648
Yeah. Yeah.

26:05.524 --> 26:07.776
Absolutely. It's better now.

26:17.452 --> 26:19.121
-[journalist] Megan.
-Hey.

26:33.844 --> 26:35.637
[Megan] Are they all famous?

26:36.805 --> 26:38.515
[Jodi] Most of them, yes.

26:39.474 --> 26:43.687
I guess my question is just, like,
is this the best use of our time?

26:43.770 --> 26:47.691
Like, as opposed to other people
we could potentially be covering.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.987
People who can't speak out.
Actresses already have a voice.

26:52.070 --> 26:55.490
But they could also fear being punished
by the film industry for using it.

26:56.158 --> 26:57.242
Sure…

26:58.035 --> 27:01.955
but what is it exactly
that we're looking at here?

27:02.039 --> 27:04.750
We're looking at extreme
sexual harassment in the workplace.

27:06.293 --> 27:08.921
These young women walked into what
they all had reason to believe

27:09.004 --> 27:12.174
were "business meetings"
with a producer, an employer.

27:12.257 --> 27:13.467
They were hopeful.

27:13.550 --> 27:17.179
They were expecting a serious conversation
about their work or a possible project.

27:17.262 --> 27:20.682
Instead, they say he met them
with threats and sexual demands.

27:21.266 --> 27:23.060
They claim assault and rape.

27:23.977 --> 27:28.023
If that can happen to Hollywood actresses,
who else is it happening to?

27:29.441 --> 27:31.527
Do you think his employees
were targeted too?

27:32.110 --> 27:33.111
I do.

27:36.490 --> 27:40.744
I could search for any police complaints
against Miramax?

27:40.827 --> 27:42.412
Or court records?

27:44.414 --> 27:45.582
Should I?

27:46.750 --> 27:47.835
Yes.

27:48.585 --> 27:52.464
[Megan] I found records of a complaint
against Miramax from 2001,

27:52.548 --> 27:55.884
but the report was closed out
the same day it was made.

27:55.968 --> 27:58.637
It says, "complainant elected
court action,"

27:58.720 --> 28:02.057
but then no court documents exist,
which seems inconsistent.

28:02.140 --> 28:04.434
Do you have any more
information on that?

28:05.060 --> 28:07.688
[government official] No. Those records
would have been destroyed.

28:08.522 --> 28:10.065
Really? Why?

28:10.148 --> 28:11.733
It's agency policy.

28:11.817 --> 28:13.986
All records are destroyed
after three years.

28:14.945 --> 28:16.113
Why is that?

28:16.738 --> 28:19.658
As I said, it's policy.

28:20.951 --> 28:25.247
So could you please tell me
who filed the sexual harassment complaint?

28:25.330 --> 28:26.957
No, I cannot.

28:28.083 --> 28:30.836
-Because?
-It's policy.

28:30.919 --> 28:33.255
We are prohibited from
giving you that name.

28:34.089 --> 28:35.507
Is that everything?

28:36.592 --> 28:38.468
This is very important.

28:38.552 --> 28:41.930
It's about someone who's still
very powerful in the workplace.

28:42.014 --> 28:44.433
Who could still be harassing someone.

28:44.516 --> 28:46.727
Is there any way you can help me?

28:50.522 --> 28:52.983
You could ask me the name
of the government investigator

28:53.066 --> 28:54.818
who was assigned the case.

28:54.902 --> 28:56.862
I could give you that information.

28:57.696 --> 28:59.531
-Just a name.
-Thank you.

29:01.450 --> 29:04.494
I've made 20 calls
to track this investigator.

29:06.246 --> 29:07.998
What did Lisa Bloom say?

29:08.999 --> 29:12.961
She just talked as though
he was kind of naughty.

29:13.045 --> 29:15.214
She was talking to me
kind of Jew-to-Jew

29:15.297 --> 29:17.591
and including Weinstein
in the gang.

29:17.674 --> 29:18.884
Oh!

29:19.718 --> 29:24.056
I had a long conversation
with Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner.

29:24.139 --> 29:26.517
They wanna help,
and they have so many numbers.

29:26.600 --> 29:27.726
Amazing.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.937
Did you know them before?

29:30.020 --> 29:32.272
[chuckles]
I don't know anyone.

29:32.356 --> 29:34.441
-In April, when I started…
-[cell phone ringing]

29:34.525 --> 29:35.859
…I was literally leaving--

29:35.943 --> 29:37.277
It's the investigator.

29:38.278 --> 29:40.697
Hi, this is Megan Twohey.
Thank you for getting back to me.

29:40.781 --> 29:42.908
[investigator] Sure. How can I help?

29:42.991 --> 29:44.701
Do you remember the case?

29:44.785 --> 29:47.955
There are hundreds of
sexual harassment cases at that agency.

29:48.789 --> 29:52.751
This one was brought to you,
and then it was closed very quickly.

29:52.835 --> 29:54.461
That's not unusual.

29:55.420 --> 29:57.756
It was filed against Miramax?

29:58.715 --> 30:00.133
What's Miramax?

30:01.468 --> 30:02.469
[sighs]

30:04.638 --> 30:06.765
[Lisa] Harvey,
I've read the thorough reports,

30:06.849 --> 30:11.103
and Rose comes across as
a disturbed, pathological liar.

30:11.186 --> 30:15.232
Clearly she must be stopped in
her ridiculous, defamatory attacks on you.

30:15.983 --> 30:18.944
She is dangerous.
You are right to be concerned.

30:19.570 --> 30:23.031
I feel equipped to help you
against the Roses of the world,

30:23.115 --> 30:26.451
because I have represented
so many of them.

30:26.535 --> 30:29.121
I'd like to meet with you to go over this
in some detail.

30:29.204 --> 30:32.749
You should be the hero of this story,
not the villain.

30:32.833 --> 30:34.168
Best. Lisa Bloom.

30:36.295 --> 30:40.424
I'm trying to get ahold of this assistant
who worked at Miramax in her early 20s.

30:41.884 --> 30:43.969
One day, she just disappeared.

30:44.052 --> 30:46.847
All she left were her running shoes
under the table.

30:46.930 --> 30:50.225
I haven't been able to find her yet,
but her mother lives in Queens.

30:50.309 --> 30:51.810
I thought I'd just show up.

31:22.382 --> 31:23.759
[doorbell rings]

31:30.974 --> 31:32.809
-Hi.
-Hello.

31:33.602 --> 31:37.397
Hi. I was expecting your mother.

31:37.481 --> 31:38.982
Oh, I'll go get her.
Who should I say--

31:39.066 --> 31:40.692
No, it's-- it's actually--

31:40.776 --> 31:42.444
You're the one I wanted to see.

31:43.737 --> 31:44.947
Excuse me?

31:45.948 --> 31:47.491
My name is Megan Twohey.

31:47.574 --> 31:50.369
I am an investigative reporter
for The New York Times.

31:51.787 --> 31:53.247
Would it be okay if--

31:53.330 --> 31:55.499
Go back upstairs. Go see Abuelita.

32:04.132 --> 32:06.385
Could we talk for a minute…

32:07.970 --> 32:09.763
about your time at Miramax?

32:10.681 --> 32:11.807
[scoffs]

32:12.599 --> 32:14.560
I can't believe you found me.

32:16.144 --> 32:18.522
I've been waiting for this for 25 years.

32:21.191 --> 32:26.363
I would love the chance
to ask you a couple questions.

32:28.740 --> 32:30.242
What do you know?

32:31.660 --> 32:36.456
That you were at the beginning
of your career and doing well.

32:38.292 --> 32:40.377
And that something happened.

32:43.088 --> 32:44.840
And then you disappeared.

32:47.885 --> 32:50.220
And that your father
threatened legal action.

32:59.438 --> 33:00.480
[exhales]

33:03.734 --> 33:05.485
All I can tell you is that…

33:07.571 --> 33:11.867
I had a business dispute
with Miramax.

33:13.493 --> 33:14.912
It was resolved.

33:15.871 --> 33:17.122
Amicably.

33:18.415 --> 33:20.584
And we've agreed
not to discuss it.

33:24.129 --> 33:25.130
I'm…

33:26.048 --> 33:27.424
so glad to meet you anyway.

33:32.930 --> 33:34.014
So…

33:35.516 --> 33:37.267
it was "resolved"?

33:38.519 --> 33:41.063
Yeah. It was.

33:49.321 --> 33:52.115
There are women
who have had settlements,

33:53.158 --> 33:54.660
and they're bound to silence,

33:55.619 --> 33:58.121
but we have
written around them.

33:59.331 --> 34:01.875
There are ways to report around
that restriction.

34:01.959 --> 34:04.086
The source
can remain anonymous.

34:07.089 --> 34:08.382
[sniffles]

34:09.341 --> 34:11.134
I should go back in.

34:15.514 --> 34:16.639
Look, I'm--

34:17.474 --> 34:20.060
Sorry. I've thrown a curveball into
your trip to see your mother,

34:20.143 --> 34:21.895
and I don't wanna keep you
from your family,

34:21.978 --> 34:25.107
but would it be okay
if I gave you my number?

34:27.775 --> 34:32.322
She was terrified, Jodi,
but she wants to talk. She really does.

34:32.406 --> 34:34.408
[Jodi] Really? That's incredible.

34:35.074 --> 34:37.244
Listen, Gwyneth Paltrow called,

34:37.327 --> 34:40.496
and she told me about an incident
at The Peninsula hotel.

34:40.581 --> 34:42.291
The Peninsula?
What the fuck?

34:42.373 --> 34:44.501
Exactly. Where Ashley went to meet him.

34:44.585 --> 34:46.670
-Shit. What happened?
-[phone beeps]

34:47.713 --> 34:49.089
Fuck. It's her. I have to go.

34:49.630 --> 34:51.007
Hi.

34:51.091 --> 34:53.217
[former assistant] Megan, we just spoke.

34:53.302 --> 34:55.053
I'm sorry, but it's a no.

34:55.137 --> 34:56.889
But good luck. Honestly.

34:56.972 --> 34:58.223
[line clicks]

35:24.958 --> 35:28.086
[Talia] So if you sign it,
you don't tell anyone about anything?

35:28.170 --> 35:30.255
Yeah. It could've been bullying,

35:30.339 --> 35:32.799
or sometimes it's just a big shop,

35:32.883 --> 35:35.636
and they don't want you
to tell their trade secrets.

35:35.719 --> 35:37.054
Did you sign one?

35:37.137 --> 35:38.972
[chuckles] No.

35:39.515 --> 35:42.809
So, shops have secrets,
but newspapers don't?

35:47.606 --> 35:50.150
I think pretty much everyone
and everything has a secret.

35:50.234 --> 35:51.109
What's yours?

35:53.362 --> 35:56.156
I will tell you one day.
Do you have one?

35:56.740 --> 35:58.033
Of course.

36:01.578 --> 36:02.913
'Course I have a secret.

36:09.962 --> 36:11.547
[car door opens, closes]

36:14.174 --> 36:15.843
[chattering]

36:37.823 --> 36:39.324
[doorbell rings]

36:47.958 --> 36:49.793
-Hello?
-[Megan] John Schmidt?

36:49.877 --> 36:52.588
My name is Megan Twohey.
I'm a reporter from The New York Times.

36:52.671 --> 36:54.631
Would it be possible to speak
for a moment?

36:54.715 --> 36:55.966
Come in.

37:01.430 --> 37:03.015
I can't see what
you want from me.

37:03.682 --> 37:06.894
[Megan] You were
the chief financial officer at Miramax.

37:06.977 --> 37:10.272
The women who received these settlements,
they can't speak out.

37:10.355 --> 37:12.149
They'll be sued if they do.

37:13.192 --> 37:16.820
But if someone could speak freely
about the payouts,

37:17.696 --> 37:19.698
that would be hugely helpful.

37:22.743 --> 37:24.453
What payouts, John?

37:32.461 --> 37:34.087
I'm not asking you to go on the record.

37:34.171 --> 37:39.092
Just to have your perspective
on what might've happened back then.

37:45.974 --> 37:47.559
I need to think about it.

37:49.937 --> 37:50.938
Okay?

37:51.772 --> 37:52.773
Okay.

37:54.149 --> 37:55.692
Sorry just to show up.

38:00.072 --> 38:01.573
-Good night.
-[door opens]

38:01.657 --> 38:02.741
[John] Good night.

38:02.824 --> 38:04.117
[door closes]

38:11.458 --> 38:14.253
[breathing heavily]

38:20.884 --> 38:23.178
[Megan] Hi, hi. Can you hear me?

38:23.262 --> 38:24.388
[EEOC caller] Yes.

38:24.471 --> 38:27.391
[Megan] Uh, I really appreciate you
talking to me on a Saturday.

38:27.474 --> 38:29.518
[EEOC caller]
I hope the links were useful.

38:29.601 --> 38:32.145
They were,
but I find it very strange

38:32.229 --> 38:35.607
that if I wanna access
certain information, I can't.

38:35.691 --> 38:39.403
The EEOC is all about information.
What could you not find?

38:39.486 --> 38:43.073
Well, for instance, which companies have
had the most sexual harassment complaints,

38:43.156 --> 38:45.367
but no one was permitted to tell me that.

38:45.450 --> 38:47.870
Yes, that would be
confidential information.

38:48.453 --> 38:49.830
But do you think that's right?

38:49.913 --> 38:52.583
Shouldn't the Equal Employment
Opportunities Commission

38:52.666 --> 38:54.585
be a resource for information?

38:56.003 --> 38:58.005
Our policies are reviewed annually.

38:58.088 --> 39:01.842
So do you know internally
which companies have the most complaints?

39:01.925 --> 39:05.804
Yes. We do, but we're not allowed
to disclose that information.

39:07.055 --> 39:09.391
So any woman applying for a job

39:09.474 --> 39:15.063
is not allowed to check the record
of that employer in terms of harassment?

39:15.147 --> 39:18.942
That's right. You should probably
talk to someone higher up.

39:19.026 --> 39:21.028
[chuckles] I'm-- I'm going to.

39:21.111 --> 39:24.281
I will, but don't you think
that's strange?

39:24.364 --> 39:26.658
That the commission is there
to protect people,

39:26.742 --> 39:31.330
but its policy prohibits sharing
the information needed to protect them?

39:32.372 --> 39:36.627
Megan, I'm not the head of the EEOC.
I was just trying to help.

39:37.419 --> 39:41.131
And you have. And it's the weekend.
I really thank you.

39:41.215 --> 39:42.466
-Okay.
-Okay.

39:42.549 --> 39:44.218
-Goodbye.
-Oh, my gosh.

39:45.802 --> 39:46.845
Amazing.

39:47.638 --> 39:48.847
Incredible.

39:49.598 --> 39:52.726
Mira or the Equal Employment
Opportunities Commission?

39:53.685 --> 39:54.686
Both.

39:56.146 --> 39:57.814
-Hi.
-Hi.

39:58.315 --> 40:00.108
[both laugh]

40:00.734 --> 40:02.903
-We're like reporting twins.
-Yeah.

40:02.986 --> 40:04.238
Should I go up and change?

40:04.321 --> 40:05.531
No, let's go.

40:07.449 --> 40:09.743
-You look nice.
-You look amazing. [laughs]

40:16.834 --> 40:17.835
-[assistant] Hi.
-[Jodi] Hi.

40:17.918 --> 40:20.337
-How was your ride?
-Yeah. It was great.

40:20.420 --> 40:21.421
[Megan] It was good.

40:21.505 --> 40:23.090
I'm Helen.
I'm Gwyneth's assistant.

40:23.173 --> 40:24.591
Gwyneth will be right with you.

40:24.675 --> 40:25.717
[Megan] Thank you.

40:30.264 --> 40:32.933
So it's a total pattern.
A pattern of behavior.

40:33.016 --> 40:35.769
Gwyneth was invited to the hotel room,
the business meeting,

40:35.853 --> 40:38.689
and then threatened with losing her job
if she refused him.

40:38.772 --> 40:41.483
She told her agent. No one does a thing.

40:41.567 --> 40:43.110
[Rebecca] Will Gwyneth go on the record?

40:43.819 --> 40:44.820
She really wants to.

40:44.903 --> 40:46.530
I think she does and she doesn't.

40:46.613 --> 40:51.243
She is scared that it could turn into
some kind of tabloidy sex scandal.

40:51.326 --> 40:55.706
I mean, Gwyneth was 23. So was Rose.
They were so young.

40:55.789 --> 40:57.708
[Rebecca]
Tell me everything when you get in.

40:57.791 --> 40:59.042
Okay. Bye.

41:01.336 --> 41:02.504
[sighs]

41:03.589 --> 41:06.633
The only way these women
are gonna go on the record…

41:06.717 --> 41:07.843
Is if they all jump together.

41:09.219 --> 41:10.220
Yeah.

41:18.562 --> 41:20.689
[doorbell rings]

41:20.772 --> 41:22.524
You take the lead on this.

41:22.608 --> 41:25.110
No, you do it.
You're less intimidating.

41:25.194 --> 41:27.112
You don't find me intimidating?

41:28.697 --> 41:31.366
-I mean-- No, it's just the height thing.
-[door opens]

41:32.159 --> 41:33.577
-Hi.
-[Jodi] Hi.

41:33.660 --> 41:35.704
We were just
in the neighborhood.

41:35.787 --> 41:37.206
We're from
The New York Times.

41:37.289 --> 41:39.708
I believe you used to work
for Harvey Weinstein?

41:43.504 --> 41:44.796
[door closes]

41:46.632 --> 41:48.467
-Think she'll go on the record?
-[laughs]

41:49.426 --> 41:50.928
Okay. I'm just gonna…

41:51.011 --> 41:52.930
[Megan] You wanna leave the note? Yeah.

42:02.523 --> 42:05.192
The NDAs are never examined or questioned.

42:05.275 --> 42:08.445
They rarely come up in open court.
Law schools don't teach them.

42:08.529 --> 42:10.781
Also, the attorneys
who represent the victims

42:10.864 --> 42:13.116
can get up to 40% of the settlement.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.285
That's a big incentive
to keep that system going.

42:15.369 --> 42:18.121
Most sexual harassment cases
are settled out of court.

42:18.205 --> 42:20.624
And most of them
have a confidentiality clause.

42:20.707 --> 42:24.002
And the women who sign these contracts
have to give over all of their evidence.

42:24.086 --> 42:26.255
Their diaries, emails, phones.

42:26.338 --> 42:29.800
It's cash for silence, and it enables
the perpetrators to continue.

42:29.883 --> 42:32.261
[Megan]
And these clauses are standard practice.

42:32.344 --> 42:35.222
The women wanna close the case.
They need the money.

42:35.305 --> 42:37.975
They don't wanna be branded
as liars or flirts.

42:38.058 --> 42:40.978
I mean, I'm sure it often seems like
the only recourse.

42:41.061 --> 42:44.898
And I imagine some women see these
settlements as a confession of guilt.

42:44.982 --> 42:48.777
They think they've scored a victory
when it's actually a gag order.

42:48.861 --> 42:50.988
And if you try and take
a case like this to court,

42:51.071 --> 42:53.115
the sexual harassment laws
are so weak.

42:53.198 --> 42:55.325
They're actually nonexistent
if you're a freelancer

42:55.409 --> 42:57.578
or if there are fewer than
15 employees in the workplace.

42:57.661 --> 42:59.454
Also,
most lawyers prefer settlements

42:59.538 --> 43:01.331
'cause it's less of a financial risk
for them.

43:01.415 --> 43:04.710
How close are any of these actresses
to going on the record?

43:04.793 --> 43:06.920
We're introducing the idea.

43:07.004 --> 43:09.882
I'm afraid we have
these horrific hotel room accounts

43:09.965 --> 43:12.050
and no corroborating evidence.

43:12.134 --> 43:16.346
We feel they'll speak out
if they're not the only ones.

43:16.430 --> 43:17.681
Safety in numbers.

43:17.764 --> 43:18.765
And settlements?

43:19.433 --> 43:21.727
Three. So far.

43:21.810 --> 43:23.770
There is Rose McGowan.

43:23.854 --> 43:26.315
We're pretty sure about
Ambra Battilana.

43:26.398 --> 43:28.901
And I would say the same
for the ex-assistant in Queens.

43:28.984 --> 43:30.319
And no documents?

43:30.402 --> 43:32.863
We do not have
a publishable story.

43:37.534 --> 43:38.577
Hey.

43:38.660 --> 43:40.245
[Dean] So, look, team.

43:40.829 --> 43:44.333
You have to imagine that every call
you make is being recorded.

43:44.416 --> 43:45.876
And you're being followed.

43:46.543 --> 43:49.254
Don't let Weinstein talk to you,
unless it's on the record.

43:50.255 --> 43:53.425
I'd be interested in talking to him
even off the record.

43:53.509 --> 43:58.013
No, if Harvey has something to say,
he needs to say it publicly.

43:58.096 --> 44:00.015
I've dealt with him before.

44:00.098 --> 44:01.350
It's ugly.

44:03.352 --> 44:06.688
[Megan] We're looking into the incident
with Ambra Battilana Gutierrez.

44:07.272 --> 44:09.566
She accused Weinstein of groping her.

44:09.650 --> 44:12.694
The NYPD gave her a wire,
and she met him again.

44:12.778 --> 44:14.404
[Jodi] But the DA wouldn't prosecute.

44:15.239 --> 44:17.741
They claimed the recording
wasn't enough to arrest him.

44:17.824 --> 44:21.578
[Megan] Linda Fairstein worked
in the DA's office. I've texted her.

44:23.497 --> 44:25.207
-[Ambra]
-[Harvey]

45:58.467 --> 46:00.469
Linda, Megan Twohey here.
How are you?

46:01.011 --> 46:03.138
[Linda] I'm good, Megan.
How can I help?

46:03.222 --> 46:06.642
Yeah, I'm looking into a police complaint
against Harvey Weinstein

46:06.725 --> 46:08.310
that wasn't charged. Two years ago.

46:08.393 --> 46:10.395
When you were at the DA's office.

46:10.479 --> 46:12.773
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez.

46:12.856 --> 46:14.816
Oh. Okay.

46:15.526 --> 46:17.361
It seemed to go away very quickly.

46:18.612 --> 46:20.155
There was no criminal conduct there.

46:20.239 --> 46:23.283
The cops seemed pretty confident
there was.

46:24.284 --> 46:26.995
Do you think there was anything irregular
about how it was handled?

46:27.579 --> 46:30.207
-I don't. Why would you say that?
-[sirens wailing]

46:30.290 --> 46:32.251
[cell phone ringing]

46:33.001 --> 46:34.002
Gwyneth.

46:34.086 --> 46:37.965
He's here. I invited a few people over,
and he turned up.

46:38.674 --> 46:42.010
I haven't seen him for years.
He must know I spoke to you.

46:42.094 --> 46:45.013
Why are you so certain
there was no criminal conduct?

46:45.097 --> 46:46.306
Wasn't there a recording?

46:48.308 --> 46:49.935
I don't think
there's a road to go down.

46:50.561 --> 46:51.895
No.

46:51.979 --> 46:54.398
Do you feel like
you're in physical danger at all?

46:54.481 --> 46:56.775
[Gwyneth] I'll keep people around me
till he goes.

46:56.859 --> 46:59.111
It's a shock.
I know he's watching me.

46:59.194 --> 47:00.237
He's letting me know.

47:01.697 --> 47:03.198
He can't do anything.

47:04.032 --> 47:06.910
Gwyneth. I'm here. Call me if you need me.

47:07.744 --> 47:08.745
Okay. Bye.

47:11.206 --> 47:13.166
Linda, do you know Harvey?

47:13.876 --> 47:15.169
I've met him socially,

47:15.252 --> 47:17.379
but we've never been
to each other's homes.

47:18.088 --> 47:21.717
-Okay. I'm sure we'll speak soon.
-Yes.

47:22.467 --> 47:23.468
Goodbye.

47:29.183 --> 47:32.060
We got a good lead to talk
to a past executive at Miramax.

47:32.144 --> 47:33.729
-Great. When will that be?
-[patron 1] Hola.

47:33.812 --> 47:35.147
Jodi's talking to her tomorrow.

47:35.230 --> 47:37.983
[patron 2] I don't think she heard you.
She definitely didn't hear you.

47:38.066 --> 47:39.943
-Oh, my God.
-What?

47:41.820 --> 47:46.283
Ronan Farrow is working on an HW piece
for The New Yorker.

47:46.366 --> 47:48.035
What? Since when?

47:48.118 --> 47:49.203
-[Jodi] She doesn't say…
-Fuck.

47:49.286 --> 47:51.914
…but apparently
he's spoken to a lot of actresses already.

47:52.873 --> 47:53.957
[waiter] Okay, ladies.

47:54.041 --> 47:55.667
These are the menus.

47:55.751 --> 47:57.085
-Thank you.
-[Rebecca] Thank you.

47:57.961 --> 48:00.839
It's pressure we can do without,
but we just keep going.

48:00.923 --> 48:02.841
And we continue to be thorough.

48:02.925 --> 48:04.468
Pardon me. Excuse me.
Hello.

48:04.551 --> 48:05.969
Hi. Hello, everyone.

48:06.053 --> 48:08.514
Did you see my friend over there?
He said hi.

48:08.597 --> 48:10.516
Could you leave us?
We're talking.

48:10.599 --> 48:12.684
I absolutely will.
I totally understand,

48:12.768 --> 48:14.353
but I was thinking
maybe I could have a moment--

48:14.436 --> 48:16.313
We're having a conversation.
So if you could just--

48:16.396 --> 48:18.732
-You should be doing something else.
-[Megan] Fuck you.

48:18.815 --> 48:22.319
-Fuck you? I would bend you over--
-Fuck you!

48:23.403 --> 48:25.531
Fuck you!
Get the fuck out of here!

48:25.614 --> 48:27.157
Fuck you, man.
Get the fuck out!

48:27.241 --> 48:28.909
[laughs]

48:30.661 --> 48:33.330
-[patron 1] Frigid bitches.
-[patron 2] Frigid bitches.

48:33.413 --> 48:35.165
[patron 3] That guy's an asshole.

48:35.249 --> 48:37.000
-[Megan whispers] Sorry.
-Don't apologize.

48:46.844 --> 48:48.345
[chattering]

48:52.850 --> 48:57.229
[Miramax executive] There was an incident
in Venice at the Film Festival.

48:57.312 --> 48:59.273
It was '98.

48:59.982 --> 49:01.525
What happened?

49:05.279 --> 49:08.782
What makes me most angry
is the silence.

49:09.408 --> 49:12.953
No one spoke out then,
and no one is talking about it now.

49:13.829 --> 49:16.832
He built the silence,
and people complied.

49:17.416 --> 49:19.877
He produced fear
and intimidation.

49:19.960 --> 49:22.462
The only alternative,
seemingly, was to quit

49:22.546 --> 49:25.924
and throw away everything
you worked so hard for out the door.

49:26.008 --> 49:28.385
You were terrified
you were gonna be the next target,

49:28.468 --> 49:30.053
so people looked the other way.

49:30.137 --> 49:31.138
Within the company?

49:31.221 --> 49:32.806
Yes, and outside of it.

49:33.515 --> 49:36.143
I mean, he played the press.
He played the agents.

49:36.226 --> 49:37.978
How did he play the press?

49:38.061 --> 49:42.441
By promising them access to stars
in exchange for hushing up some incident.

49:42.524 --> 49:43.692
What sort of incident?

49:45.110 --> 49:46.278
Where do I start?

49:47.237 --> 49:49.448
Harvey had this--
What did they call it?

49:50.240 --> 49:54.995
"A physical altercation"
with a male employee at a conference.

49:55.579 --> 49:57.122
Then they settled with the guy.

49:57.873 --> 49:59.291
And with women?

50:00.626 --> 50:01.627
He pursued them.

50:02.794 --> 50:03.962
Endlessly.

50:07.716 --> 50:09.635
What happened in Venice?

50:11.762 --> 50:14.556
I don't wanna be quoted. Period.

50:15.307 --> 50:16.475
Understood.

50:20.604 --> 50:22.231
We were in Harvey's suite,

50:22.314 --> 50:24.691
and there were
a bunch of people in there.

50:25.275 --> 50:29.696
And there were these two assistants,
and they were sitting there trembling.

50:30.447 --> 50:32.157
And Weinstein was there?

50:32.241 --> 50:33.283
Yes.

50:34.409 --> 50:36.912
He was talking film
and ignoring them,

50:37.996 --> 50:39.998
but they were literally vibrating.

50:40.874 --> 50:44.211
One with fear,
the other with anger.

50:46.547 --> 50:47.965
Can you tell me their names?

50:49.132 --> 50:50.217
Yes.

50:55.514 --> 50:58.433
And there's another woman
you should call.

50:59.560 --> 51:02.771
The two assistants are Rowena Chiu
and Zelda Perkins,

51:02.855 --> 51:05.899
and we have a third name,
Laura Madden.

51:05.983 --> 51:08.694
And none of them are returning our calls.

51:08.777 --> 51:10.487
So? Show up in person.

51:11.071 --> 51:12.573
Yeah. [chuckles]

51:13.115 --> 51:17.202
They live in London,
Silicon Valley and Wales.

51:17.828 --> 51:19.288
Can you get on a plane?

51:26.587 --> 51:29.131
Let me work it out with Ron.

51:32.509 --> 51:34.845
But yeah, of course.

51:34.928 --> 51:38.432
Documents, verification.
You know what we need.

52:22.601 --> 52:23.602
Hi.

52:24.561 --> 52:27.064
Sorry to bother you.
I can see you're busy.

52:27.147 --> 52:29.399
I was looking for Rowena Chiu.

52:30.484 --> 52:31.735
Hi.

52:31.818 --> 52:35.197
Rowena's not here right now.
Can I give her a message?

52:35.906 --> 52:37.282
When will she be back?

52:37.366 --> 52:40.452
My wife's out of the country for a while.

52:40.536 --> 52:41.537
[chuckles] I see.

52:42.162 --> 52:44.206
I did try calling her.

52:44.289 --> 52:45.666
This a work thing?

52:45.749 --> 52:46.750
No.

52:46.834 --> 52:49.211
You must be Andrew?
Andrew Cheung?

52:49.294 --> 52:51.797
I'm Jodi Kantor.
I'm from The New York Times.

52:51.880 --> 52:53.048
Okay.

52:53.924 --> 52:56.552
So, what did you wanna
talk to Rowena about?

52:57.553 --> 53:00.806
We're researching a story
about Miramax.

53:00.889 --> 53:02.891
I flew in from New York.

53:03.600 --> 53:05.853
-You came all this way?
-Yeah.

53:07.479 --> 53:09.898
Um, could we talk for a minute?

53:10.524 --> 53:11.525
Sure.

53:12.192 --> 53:17.155
So, I've been speaking with people
who worked for Harvey Weinstein.

53:18.115 --> 53:20.868
You're going quite far back
with Rowena's time there.

53:21.451 --> 53:23.787
We're writing about
his treatment of women.

53:23.871 --> 53:25.080
Right.

53:25.163 --> 53:27.457
And Rowena fits in how?

53:29.251 --> 53:32.504
Your wife worked at Miramax
for some years.

53:33.338 --> 53:36.216
Yes. Mainly in Hong Kong.

53:36.800 --> 53:39.636
I'd like to hear about her experiences
working for Weinstein.

53:40.554 --> 53:42.598
I'm confused why you can't discuss it
on the phone.

53:42.681 --> 53:43.807
[laughs]

53:43.891 --> 53:47.186
I did try.
It is always better to actually meet.

53:50.230 --> 53:51.356
So…

53:53.066 --> 53:55.152
And this is off the record.

53:56.153 --> 53:57.487
My understanding is that--

53:58.322 --> 54:00.199
that Weinstein possibly
victimized your wife

54:00.282 --> 54:01.867
when Rowena first worked for him.

54:05.662 --> 54:08.749
Rowena's never mentioned
anything like that to me.

54:09.583 --> 54:12.628
What do you mean by "victimized"?
Can you be more specific?

54:14.254 --> 54:18.133
I was told that your wife may have
received a settlement from Weinstein.

54:19.009 --> 54:22.221
[scoffs] Do I look like a guy
whose wife got a settlement?

54:23.972 --> 54:26.433
Could you have confused her
with someone else?

54:26.517 --> 54:29.770
I apologize for taking up your time. I'm--

54:30.479 --> 54:32.773
Would you just please give this to Rowena?

54:33.690 --> 54:37.027
If you're talking to these other people,
why do you need to talk to Rowena?

54:37.653 --> 54:41.323
And if you turn up in my driveway,
what kind of victimization?

54:42.366 --> 54:43.450
It's complex.

54:43.534 --> 54:45.786
I'm asking you to expand on it.

54:46.370 --> 54:49.289
I really think it would be best…

54:50.791 --> 54:52.626
if you asked Rowena.

54:52.709 --> 54:54.127
Have a good day.

55:02.636 --> 55:04.096
[engine starts]

55:07.307 --> 55:09.226
[Jodi] I just couldn't lie to him.

55:09.309 --> 55:10.894
And then it turns out he didn't know.

55:11.645 --> 55:13.438
What if London is a repeat of this?

55:13.522 --> 55:14.690
It won't be.

55:15.274 --> 55:17.359
I spoke with an employment lawyer
in the UK

55:17.442 --> 55:20.821
and he told me
that it was irresponsible of me

55:20.904 --> 55:22.865
even to ask about
breaching NDAs.

55:22.948 --> 55:24.408
No one does it.
They would get sued.

55:24.491 --> 55:26.201
Fuck that guy.

55:26.285 --> 55:28.537
Honestly, Jodi, fuck him. He has no idea.

55:29.371 --> 55:31.248
I wish I smoked or something.

55:32.249 --> 55:35.169
I'm staring at an actual brick wall

55:35.252 --> 55:37.296
and all I can think is, "Fuck."

55:37.379 --> 55:38.589
That's okay.

55:39.715 --> 55:40.716
Fuck.

55:41.383 --> 55:43.552
And documents.

55:53.145 --> 55:54.479
So, Laura,

55:54.563 --> 55:57.191
we are looking
at a full mastectomy.

55:57.274 --> 55:59.943
And we should schedule this
as soon as possible.

56:01.195 --> 56:02.696
I understand.

56:07.701 --> 56:09.369
[line ringing]

56:12.414 --> 56:13.665
[Laura] Hello.

56:13.749 --> 56:15.000
Hi.

56:15.083 --> 56:17.920
Laura, this is Jodi Kantor
from The New York Times.

56:18.003 --> 56:20.547
Um, I hope you've been
getting my messages.

56:20.631 --> 56:23.926
I'm in California right now,
but I'm coming to London tomorrow.

56:24.510 --> 56:25.844
Hi, Jodi.

56:26.345 --> 56:27.638
Hi.

56:27.721 --> 56:29.097
Um…

56:29.181 --> 56:31.934
I'm so happy to be
finally speaking with you.

56:32.017 --> 56:35.187
I understand that you once worked
for Harvey Weinstein

56:35.270 --> 56:37.147
in the London office of Miramax.

56:37.231 --> 56:38.482
Is that right?

56:40.234 --> 56:41.360
Laura?

56:42.569 --> 56:44.321

56:48.325 --> 56:49.326
Laura…

56:49.993 --> 56:50.994
[sighs]

56:51.620 --> 56:53.163
Can I do anything to help?

56:53.789 --> 56:56.542
No. I can't talk about this right now.

You have the same pieces as me.

57:09.763 --> 57:11.515
Hey.

57:11.598 --> 57:13.725
Hey, my love. Come here.

57:17.187 --> 57:18.397
Hey, now.

57:19.898 --> 57:21.692
It's going to be all right.

57:22.401 --> 57:25.487
-It's going to be all right.
-I'm so sorry, Mum.

57:25.571 --> 57:26.864

57:56.018 --> 57:57.019
[waiter] Here we are.

58:00.147 --> 58:01.148

58:02.316 --> 58:03.358
Thank you.

58:05.027 --> 58:06.820
[chattering]

58:22.336 --> 58:24.755
You know, other people have tried
to write this story.

58:24.838 --> 58:26.131
He kills it every time.

58:26.215 --> 58:27.966
We're aware of that.

58:29.384 --> 58:31.512
And we're not gonna
let that happen to us.

58:35.891 --> 58:37.392
Are you okay, Zelda?

58:37.476 --> 58:38.519
Yes.

58:40.270 --> 58:41.271
So,

58:42.648 --> 58:44.566
you started working at Miramax
when you were 21?

58:44.650 --> 58:47.528
Yes.
I was an assistant at the London office.

58:48.195 --> 58:49.446
And how was it?

58:49.530 --> 58:50.822
It was great,

58:50.906 --> 58:53.242
but it would shift
when Harvey came to town.

58:53.325 --> 58:54.868
In what way?

58:54.952 --> 58:58.205
Everyone became
on call to Harvey.

58:58.872 --> 59:00.332
And what would that entail?

59:01.458 --> 59:04.294
Script meetings, discussions,

59:04.378 --> 59:05.921
and more personal stuff.

59:06.505 --> 59:07.881
Like?

59:07.965 --> 59:12.052
For instance, I would have to go
to his hotel and wake Harvey up.

59:12.886 --> 59:15.973
Run a shower for him.
Get him out of bed.

59:16.056 --> 59:17.683
He would usually be naked.

59:17.766 --> 59:19.643
And he might try
to pull me onto him.

59:20.352 --> 59:22.980
-What did you do?
-Fend him off.

59:23.063 --> 59:25.440
I found humor
or aggression worked best.

59:26.149 --> 59:29.403
Harvey was either excited or furious.

59:29.945 --> 59:31.572
You never knew which it would be.

59:32.614 --> 59:35.868
Did anyone on the team
give you advice about him?

59:35.951 --> 59:37.244
Yes. [chuckles]

59:37.327 --> 59:40.539
Once, one girl told me
to always wear my puffer jacket,

59:40.622 --> 59:43.333
and to always sit in an armchair,

59:43.417 --> 59:45.460
never the sofa next to him,

59:45.544 --> 59:46.837
which helped.

59:47.838 --> 59:50.799
And that's how I knew
that it wasn't only happening to me.

59:52.009 --> 59:53.927
What was happening exactly?

59:54.011 --> 59:55.012
Bullying.

59:55.929 --> 59:57.097
Emotional abuse.

59:58.015 --> 59:59.892
I was just too young
to understand it.

1:00:01.351 --> 1:00:03.937
Harvey wanted people
to submit to him.

1:00:04.021 --> 1:00:05.022
And if they didn't?

1:00:05.105 --> 1:00:07.399
Well, then he'd roar. And he'd spit.

1:00:08.150 --> 1:00:09.985
He could destroy someone in seconds.

1:00:11.570 --> 1:00:12.905
Were you scared of him?

1:00:13.989 --> 1:00:16.241
Yes. We all were.

1:00:19.411 --> 1:00:21.580
So, three years into this,

1:00:21.663 --> 1:00:23.749
you were at
the Venice Film Festival.

1:00:26.877 --> 1:00:28.504
I resigned after that.

1:00:29.588 --> 1:00:30.631
What happened?

1:00:30.714 --> 1:00:32.591
I can't tell you all of it.

1:00:32.674 --> 1:00:34.176
What can you tell me?

1:00:35.093 --> 1:00:37.596

[Zelda] There was a new assistant.

1:00:45.771 --> 1:00:46.897
She was my age.

1:00:47.731 --> 1:00:49.691
She was great. She was very smart.

1:00:49.775 --> 1:00:51.026
[both laughing]

1:00:51.109 --> 1:00:55.155
And she was doing Harvey's evening
script meeting alone for the first time,

1:00:55.239 --> 1:00:57.741
and I told her to call me
if he got difficult.

1:00:59.368 --> 1:01:01.078
Was he pursuing her?

1:01:01.161 --> 1:01:02.663
No. [chuckles]

1:01:02.746 --> 1:01:05.791
Harvey said, "I don't like
Jewish or Asian women."

1:01:06.917 --> 1:01:08.418
-But that night--
-She called you.

1:01:08.502 --> 1:01:09.336
No.

1:01:09.419 --> 1:01:10.420
[knocks on door]

1:01:10.504 --> 1:01:12.798
The following morning she came to me,

1:01:13.966 --> 1:01:15.133
and she was sobbing.

1:01:15.217 --> 1:01:16.844
I mean, she was hysterical.

1:01:16.927 --> 1:01:18.428
Rowena,
what happened?

1:01:19.513 --> 1:01:20.514
-Sit.
-[sobbing]

1:01:20.597 --> 1:01:22.766
-[Zelda] And I held her.
-What is it?

1:01:23.725 --> 1:01:26.436
Did she tell you
what he did?

1:01:28.021 --> 1:01:29.106
Not exactly.

1:01:29.857 --> 1:01:31.525
Only that no one must know.

1:01:31.608 --> 1:01:32.693
But I knew.

1:01:33.235 --> 1:01:34.820
I knew that he must've…

1:01:36.989 --> 1:01:38.282
What?

1:01:38.365 --> 1:01:40.033
She was so upset.

1:01:40.742 --> 1:01:44.037
I knew that it had to be
the worst possible thing.

1:01:45.831 --> 1:01:48.292
I calmed her down,
and I went straight to confront Harvey.

1:01:48.876 --> 1:01:51.378
He was in a meeting with Scorsese,

1:01:52.129 --> 1:01:54.756
who hated him,
so it was a really big deal for Harvey.

1:01:55.299 --> 1:01:57.342
And I went straight up to him,

1:01:57.426 --> 1:02:01.054
and I said very clearly,
"You need to come with me right now."

1:02:01.138 --> 1:02:03.056
You went right up to them
and confronted him?

1:02:03.140 --> 1:02:05.267
Yeah. I was so angry.

1:02:05.934 --> 1:02:07.644
And in front of everyone,

1:02:07.728 --> 1:02:09.980
he stood up, and…

1:02:11.064 --> 1:02:12.649
he followed me like a lamb.

1:02:14.484 --> 1:02:16.904
And then I knew, then I knew he did it.

1:02:18.363 --> 1:02:20.199
-And then?
-He denied it.

1:02:20.282 --> 1:02:22.201
He said,
"I swear on my wife and kids' lives

1:02:22.284 --> 1:02:24.411
that I did not assault that young woman."

1:02:24.995 --> 1:02:27.289
And then I knew that he was lying.

1:02:27.372 --> 1:02:30.417
He always used that line
as a get-out-of-jail-free card. Always.

1:02:31.585 --> 1:02:35.422
Did the assistant
report it to the police?

1:02:35.506 --> 1:02:37.591
No. She told no one.

1:02:39.927 --> 1:02:43.305
We came back to London.
We both resigned.

1:02:43.388 --> 1:02:44.890
I told my direct superior,

1:02:44.973 --> 1:02:48.185
who suggested we get ourselves
a good lawyer.

1:02:49.102 --> 1:02:50.896
I had no idea where to get one.

1:02:50.979 --> 1:02:53.232
I found a company
close to the office.

1:02:53.315 --> 1:02:55.359
And then I thought
it would be simple.

1:02:55.442 --> 1:02:56.818
Criminal proceedings.

1:02:56.902 --> 1:02:58.820
But our lawyer said
we had no chance

1:02:58.904 --> 1:03:00.989
and the only thing to do
was to agree to a settlement.

1:03:01.073 --> 1:03:02.407
And I said categorically no,

1:03:02.491 --> 1:03:05.619
that no money should change hands
and that we just wanted to stop him.

1:03:05.702 --> 1:03:07.663
And no UK police were involved?

1:03:07.746 --> 1:03:09.248
We had no case.

1:03:09.331 --> 1:03:12.251
We had no evidence
and no police report from Venice.

1:03:12.334 --> 1:03:15.921
And, you see, with rape, it is impossibly
difficult to get a prosecution.

1:03:16.004 --> 1:03:19.341
And the lawyers kept saying
damage limitation was the only way to go.

1:03:19.424 --> 1:03:23.470
So I said, "All right, then.
We have our own very real demands."

1:03:23.554 --> 1:03:26.306
Conditions that Harvey would have to meet
if we were to sign.

1:03:26.390 --> 1:03:28.016
And what were those conditions?

1:03:28.100 --> 1:03:31.395
We demanded that if Harvey had
another settlement within two years,

1:03:31.478 --> 1:03:34.231
that it had to be reported to Disney
or else he would be fired.

1:03:34.857 --> 1:03:36.859
Another was that
he would go to therapy,

1:03:36.942 --> 1:03:40.112
with me present initially,
so that he couldn't lie to the therapist.

1:03:40.195 --> 1:03:44.992
We demanded that HR would put in a system
to protect the women and staff.

1:03:45.075 --> 1:03:48.412
And it felt like
if we could achieve all of those,

1:03:48.495 --> 1:03:50.497
then that's what our silence
was paying for.

1:03:50.581 --> 1:03:53.166
That we were paying for him to stop.

1:03:54.710 --> 1:03:55.961
So we signed.

1:03:56.670 --> 1:03:59.006
And they had their own
insane conditions for us.

1:03:59.715 --> 1:04:00.966
What were they?

1:04:02.467 --> 1:04:05.721
I tried to commit them to memory.
They wouldn't give us our own copy.

1:04:05.804 --> 1:04:06.930
What?

1:04:07.014 --> 1:04:09.474
I was only given visitation rights
to my own settlement.

1:04:09.558 --> 1:04:10.642
That's in--

1:04:12.186 --> 1:04:13.353
That's incredible.

1:04:13.979 --> 1:04:15.689
But you memorized them?

1:04:16.940 --> 1:04:18.775
I asked for letters, too,

1:04:18.859 --> 1:04:21.862
which stated some of the conditions.

1:04:22.571 --> 1:04:23.697
One said,

1:04:23.780 --> 1:04:29.995
"We will make best endeavors to not help
the police in a criminal or civil case."

1:04:30.871 --> 1:04:34.625
We weren't allowed to talk
to our family or a doctor.

1:04:36.710 --> 1:04:38.295
So finally we signed.

1:04:39.379 --> 1:04:40.881
They gave us some money.

1:04:42.132 --> 1:04:44.343
And I felt completely broken.

1:04:52.684 --> 1:04:54.603
I interviewed for other jobs afterwards,

1:04:54.686 --> 1:04:57.189
but everyone kept saying,
"Why did you leave Harvey?"

1:05:03.529 --> 1:05:05.072
They all assumed that I'd…

1:05:06.156 --> 1:05:07.991
been with him, you know?

1:05:08.075 --> 1:05:09.493
It was horrible.

1:05:11.912 --> 1:05:13.247
What did you do then?

1:05:13.872 --> 1:05:15.666
I went to visit a friend in Guatemala,

1:05:16.291 --> 1:05:17.668
and I stayed for five years.

1:05:19.044 --> 1:05:21.421
I had no chance
of ever working in film again

1:05:21.505 --> 1:05:23.131
and I couldn't speak freely,

1:05:24.299 --> 1:05:25.425
so I worked with horses.

1:05:31.390 --> 1:05:32.724
You've lost a lot.

1:05:32.808 --> 1:05:34.560

1:05:40.524 --> 1:05:42.693
These are the original letters.

1:05:44.486 --> 1:05:46.363
I had to have their permission

1:05:47.072 --> 1:05:49.408
if I wanted to contact a therapist

1:05:49.491 --> 1:05:50.951
or speak to an accountant.

1:05:52.786 --> 1:05:58.166
I was "never to speak to any other media,
now or hereafter existing, about it."

1:05:59.793 --> 1:06:00.794
Jodi,

1:06:01.628 --> 1:06:03.505
this is bigger than Weinstein.

1:06:04.089 --> 1:06:07.509
This is about the system
protecting abusers.

1:06:09.094 --> 1:06:10.762
I want you to take these,

1:06:11.847 --> 1:06:13.849
and I want you to use them.

1:06:18.604 --> 1:06:19.897
I've got to go now.

1:06:41.585 --> 1:06:42.794
Is it dark there?

1:06:42.878 --> 1:06:45.255
It's, like, four o'clock here.

1:06:45.339 --> 1:06:47.382

1:06:52.054 --> 1:06:53.805
Just a few women.

1:06:53.889 --> 1:06:56.892
Can you find me a shell?
And a cat hat for Violet?

1:06:56.975 --> 1:06:58.685
I will work on that.

1:06:58.769 --> 1:07:00.604
Have you been okay without me?

1:07:01.104 --> 1:07:02.898
Sure. You're back tomorrow.

1:07:02.981 --> 1:07:04.274

-Yay!

1:07:07.319 --> 1:07:08.320
So,

1:07:09.071 --> 1:07:11.740
what did they do,
the women you're meeting?

1:07:12.366 --> 1:07:14.326
We'll talk about it when you're older.

1:07:15.118 --> 1:07:17.496
Are they criminals? Bank robbers?

1:07:17.579 --> 1:07:18.622
No.

1:07:19.540 --> 1:07:20.666
Was it rape?

1:07:24.878 --> 1:07:28.340
Talia, I don't think
I've ever heard you use that word.

1:07:29.383 --> 1:07:31.927
Boys say it all the time. And girls.

1:07:32.803 --> 1:07:35.764
They shouldn't.
That word shouldn't be used casually.

I'm sorry.

1:07:38.058 --> 1:07:40.185

1:08:17.389 --> 1:08:19.433
-And he's probably going to help them.
-[phone ringing]

1:08:19.515 --> 1:08:21.475
-He's going to kill them.
-Hello?

1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:23.770
-What? No.
-May I ask who's calling?

1:08:23.854 --> 1:08:26.189
Probably going to help them
if they need to get in.

1:08:26.273 --> 1:08:27.733
Now, who's Potts?

1:08:27.816 --> 1:08:29.859
-I know, but they don't look like--
-Mum.

1:08:31.569 --> 1:08:33.279
It's another call from America.

1:08:33.363 --> 1:08:35.948
I told you, sweetie,
just tell any journalist, "No."

1:08:36.033 --> 1:08:38.118
No, she says you worked together.

1:08:39.161 --> 1:08:40.370
Pamela Lubell?

1:08:40.453 --> 1:08:42.080
[chattering on TV]

1:08:43.040 --> 1:08:45.082
Hywel wants to take his yellow pillow
to Cornwall.

1:08:45.167 --> 1:08:47.127
-No, we're not taking--
-So?

1:08:47.211 --> 1:08:49.046
We're not taking any pillows.

1:08:49.129 --> 1:08:50.214
Why?

1:08:50.296 --> 1:08:51.840
Pamela?

1:08:52.549 --> 1:08:53.550
God.

1:08:55.594 --> 1:08:58.805
Hi, Pamela. How are you?
It's been decades.

1:08:58.889 --> 1:09:02.684
I know, Laura. It's really been a while.
How's life?

1:09:02.768 --> 1:09:03.852
It's good.

1:09:04.435 --> 1:09:06.188
How's everything? How are you?

1:09:07.189 --> 1:09:08.649
Yeah, I'm okay.

1:09:09.274 --> 1:09:10.734
That's great.

1:09:10.817 --> 1:09:13.904
Laura, have you had any calls
from reporters

1:09:13.987 --> 1:09:16.031
trying to write stories about Harvey?

1:09:16.782 --> 1:09:18.700
Uh, I have, actually. Yes.

1:09:18.783 --> 1:09:20.577
I didn't talk to them.

1:09:21.411 --> 1:09:23.247
Good. That's good to hear.

1:09:23.330 --> 1:09:25.249
Cockroach journalists.

1:09:25.332 --> 1:09:27.792
It was great, wasn't it? Back then?

1:09:27.876 --> 1:09:29.962
Harvey was always very generous.

1:09:30.921 --> 1:09:32.589
That wasn't my experience.

1:09:33.715 --> 1:09:37.010
Laura, can I have your assurance
that you won't talk to anyone?

1:09:37.803 --> 1:09:40.096
What? What did you say?

1:09:40.889 --> 1:09:43.392
If you have a project,
I can take it to Harvey.

1:09:44.184 --> 1:09:45.185
I don't.

1:09:45.894 --> 1:09:47.645
And I'll talk to who I please.

1:10:02.327 --> 1:10:03.996
-[concierge] Good evening.
-Good evening.

1:10:04.079 --> 1:10:07.416
I need to book a flight to Cornwall
first thing in the morning.

1:10:07.499 --> 1:10:08.876
Flight to Cornwall tomorrow?

1:10:08.959 --> 1:10:12.004
Yes. To Newquay airport?

1:10:12.087 --> 1:10:13.505
-Newquay.
-[Jodi] Newquay.

1:10:13.589 --> 1:10:15.299
You'd normally just get a train.

1:10:15.382 --> 1:10:16.592
Okay, train, then.

1:10:30.522 --> 1:10:32.774
[Jodi]
This is a nice place for a vacation.

1:10:32.858 --> 1:10:33.984
-Yeah.
-Mom.

1:10:34.067 --> 1:10:35.068
Hi.

1:10:35.152 --> 1:10:37.237
Um, Hywel wants to play at the rocks.
Is that okay?

1:10:37.321 --> 1:10:38.614
-Yeah, sure.
-Okay.

1:10:40.782 --> 1:10:42.284
Is that your eldest?

1:10:42.367 --> 1:10:43.702
Yes. [chuckles]

1:10:44.995 --> 1:10:46.580
Yes. She's 13.

1:10:49.041 --> 1:10:50.209
You grew up in Ireland?

1:10:50.292 --> 1:10:52.211
I did, yes.

1:10:53.378 --> 1:10:58.008
And your first job was
wrangling extras in '92?

1:10:58.091 --> 1:11:00.177
They were shooting near us.

1:11:00.260 --> 1:11:01.345
I loved it.

1:11:02.221 --> 1:11:04.973
And then I heard that Miramax
were making a film nearby,

1:11:05.057 --> 1:11:07.476
and I got a job
as a runner on that.

1:11:07.559 --> 1:11:09.478
I was ecstatic. It was great.

1:11:11.396 --> 1:11:14.316
And you met
Harvey Weinstein when?

1:11:14.900 --> 1:11:16.318
Soon after that.

1:11:16.401 --> 1:11:19.112
I was going to be working
directly for him.

1:11:19.196 --> 1:11:21.323
Doing errands,
answering calls.

1:11:22.115 --> 1:11:24.451
I was very happy
to be asked.

1:11:27.037 --> 1:11:28.163
He was charming.

1:11:28.247 --> 1:11:32.167
He was saying he'd heard
how hard I worked.

1:11:32.251 --> 1:11:34.962
And I was just excited.

1:11:36.046 --> 1:11:37.297
I was 21, you know.

1:11:37.381 --> 1:11:40.217
Very young, but incredibly keen.

1:11:41.760 --> 1:11:45.639
So when he said he'd give me
a permanent job at the London office,

1:11:45.722 --> 1:11:47.391
I felt so happy.

1:11:48.517 --> 1:11:50.185
[Jodi] He said that in the meeting?

1:11:50.269 --> 1:11:51.562
[Laura] Yes.

1:11:51.645 --> 1:11:55.065
He was in his bathrobe
when he opened the door,

1:11:55.148 --> 1:11:58.777
but I thought that was
maybe very Hollywood.

1:11:59.862 --> 1:12:01.780
But quite soon into talking,

1:12:02.698 --> 1:12:04.950
he said would I give him
a massage.

1:12:07.744 --> 1:12:08.912
I said, "No."

1:12:09.872 --> 1:12:13.292
He was very matter-of-fact.
He said, "It's not a romantic request."

1:12:13.375 --> 1:12:15.127
Everyone does it for him.

1:12:15.836 --> 1:12:17.254
It's part of the job.

1:12:20.340 --> 1:12:25.304
So, I suddenly thought
that I was the problem, you know.

1:12:25.387 --> 1:12:28.056
That I was the one
who was sexualizing it.

1:12:28.974 --> 1:12:30.976
That I was just young
and uptight.

1:12:32.269 --> 1:12:33.270
So, I--

1:12:34.938 --> 1:12:37.107
I put my hands on his shoulders,

1:12:37.191 --> 1:12:42.029
but I couldn't actually move them at all
over his body.

1:12:43.071 --> 1:12:45.824
I just stood there.
My hands wouldn't move.

1:12:46.533 --> 1:12:50.787
And then he said he would give me
a massage first…

1:12:51.872 --> 1:12:53.207
to relax me.

1:12:56.251 --> 1:12:57.753
And he said,

1:12:57.836 --> 1:13:01.507
"Look, all the girls do it.
It's just work."

1:13:02.758 --> 1:13:05.177
And then he said,
"Take your top off."

1:13:05.761 --> 1:13:07.179
Very matter-of-fact.

1:13:08.263 --> 1:13:09.848
"Take your bra off."

1:13:14.978 --> 1:13:16.063
And I did.

1:13:17.731 --> 1:13:21.318
I was terrified, but I just thought,

1:13:21.985 --> 1:13:24.571
"Get through it. Do it."

1:13:27.074 --> 1:13:28.784
And then my trousers were off.

1:13:28.867 --> 1:13:31.954
And he was standing over me…

1:13:33.121 --> 1:13:34.456
masturbating.

1:13:36.124 --> 1:13:38.544
I asked him to leave me alone.

1:13:39.419 --> 1:13:42.506
But he kept asking for different things.

1:13:42.589 --> 1:13:45.300
And then he suggested a shower,
and I got up.

1:13:46.885 --> 1:13:49.263
And he carried on…

1:13:50.389 --> 1:13:51.974
masturbating.

1:13:52.641 --> 1:13:54.685
And I kept crying.

1:13:54.768 --> 1:13:57.563
And I was sobbing,
and the water was pouring down,

1:13:57.646 --> 1:14:01.650
and he was still masturbating.

1:14:03.318 --> 1:14:04.486
Then he got angry.

1:14:04.570 --> 1:14:07.739
I think my crying was so loud,
it put him off.

1:14:09.032 --> 1:14:11.743
And he left the bathroom,

1:14:11.827 --> 1:14:13.912
and I locked the door.

1:14:14.705 --> 1:14:17.332
-And I could still hear him…
-[water running]

1:14:17.416 --> 1:14:18.834
…on the other side.

1:14:19.626 --> 1:14:22.629
Still the sounds of him masturbating.

1:14:25.174 --> 1:14:27.301
Finally, I went back into the room itself

1:14:27.384 --> 1:14:31.263
and grabbed my clothes and belongings,
and I just ran.

1:14:31.346 --> 1:14:33.724
I ran down the street.

1:14:33.807 --> 1:14:37.311
I've never run that fast in my life.

1:14:43.650 --> 1:14:45.360
[Jodi] How do you feel about it now?

1:14:52.117 --> 1:14:53.577
I… [sighs]

1:14:54.745 --> 1:14:56.079
I--

1:14:56.163 --> 1:15:00.250
I feel like it dictated
a certain direction my life took.

1:15:01.460 --> 1:15:05.214
That-- I just felt that it was
this huge error of judgment

1:15:05.297 --> 1:15:08.509
that sort of marked me
and all my decisions.

1:15:09.885 --> 1:15:10.886
And--

1:15:13.055 --> 1:15:15.349
I felt such shame…

1:15:17.434 --> 1:15:20.521
that… I let him do that.

1:15:24.024 --> 1:15:26.777
Did you think that he had done
the same to other girls?

1:15:26.860 --> 1:15:28.737
I thought that
he must've tried it.

1:15:30.697 --> 1:15:32.950
But that they'd all s--

1:15:34.868 --> 1:15:36.453
they'd all said, "No."

1:15:40.791 --> 1:15:44.086
It was like he took my voice that day.

1:15:46.755 --> 1:15:51.009
Just when I was about
to start finding it.

1:15:54.179 --> 1:15:56.139
[Sarah Sanders on TV]
…responsible immigration reform?

1:15:56.223 --> 1:15:58.392
The president certainly welcomes
those conversations.

1:15:58.475 --> 1:15:59.601
[phone ringing]

1:15:59.685 --> 1:16:00.686
Yes?

1:16:00.769 --> 1:16:03.313
[secretary] I have Harvey Weinstein
on the phone for you.

1:16:04.189 --> 1:16:05.524
Put him through. Thank you.

1:16:08.402 --> 1:16:10.529
Dean, how are you?
This is Harvey.

1:16:10.612 --> 1:16:12.281
Hi, Harvey.
What can I do for you?

1:16:13.282 --> 1:16:15.617
If I hadn't made movies,
I would've been a journalist.

1:16:17.202 --> 1:16:19.997
Dean, I heard someone was working
on a story about me.

1:16:20.080 --> 1:16:22.875
Yes. If you'd like to talk
to the reporters on the record,

1:16:22.958 --> 1:16:23.959
they'd welcome that.

1:16:24.042 --> 1:16:25.085
I wanna talk to you, Dean.

1:16:25.169 --> 1:16:27.296
Well, talk to my reporters
about your concerns.

1:16:27.379 --> 1:16:29.423
I'm sorry. I have work to do.

1:16:29.506 --> 1:16:30.716
Are you gonna hang up?

1:16:30.799 --> 1:16:32.634
Unless you have anything else to say?

1:16:33.302 --> 1:16:34.553
I love the truth.

1:16:35.304 --> 1:16:37.264
People make up stories a lot.

1:16:37.806 --> 1:16:39.224
Be careful with that.

1:16:39.308 --> 1:16:41.226
That's fine, Harvey. Goodbye.

1:16:42.728 --> 1:16:45.647
[news anchor on TV] But essentially,
Sarah Sanders was saying, "Hey, America."

1:16:45.731 --> 1:16:49.026
Perhaps they didn't like it.
They didn't put him in the Oval Office.

1:16:49.109 --> 1:16:52.779
Pretty in-depth. But the focus
was primarily on solutions…

1:16:52.863 --> 1:16:54.489
[phone ringing]

1:16:57.576 --> 1:16:59.203
-Hi, Chanel.
-Hey, Dean.

1:16:59.286 --> 1:17:00.329
Hey, Tim.

1:17:06.460 --> 1:17:07.961
-Matt, you got a minute?
-Yeah.

1:17:09.838 --> 1:17:11.048
[Dean] So, what do we have?

1:17:11.131 --> 1:17:13.133
Well, the biggest thing
is the documents

1:17:13.217 --> 1:17:15.469
that Jodi got from Zelda Perkins
in London.

1:17:15.552 --> 1:17:17.596
Rose is still off the record,

1:17:17.679 --> 1:17:20.766
but she has given us permission
to write about her settlement.

1:17:20.849 --> 1:17:23.227
We're just trying to figure out
a way to confirm it.

1:17:23.310 --> 1:17:27.064
Harvey offered her a million dollars
recently for her silence.

1:17:27.606 --> 1:17:28.607
And?

1:17:28.690 --> 1:17:31.151
Rose refused,
but she doesn't want us to quote her.

1:17:31.235 --> 1:17:33.862
There are still no on-the-record sources.
NDAs are a problem.

1:17:34.530 --> 1:17:35.864
[Megan] Laura Madden didn't sign one.

1:17:35.948 --> 1:17:39.243
She's the only ex-assistant
who is technically free to speak.

1:17:39.326 --> 1:17:42.663
Ashley and Gwyneth didn't sign one either,
but they're not ready to go on the record.

1:17:42.746 --> 1:17:45.832
But Laura Madden has to deal with
something very different right now.

1:17:45.916 --> 1:17:48.001
[Megan] She has breast cancer.
She has to go into surgery.

1:17:48.085 --> 1:17:49.878
So, it's not likely.

1:17:49.962 --> 1:17:52.047
I'm still leaving messages
for Rowena Chiu,

1:17:52.130 --> 1:17:53.757
but there's no engagement.

1:17:53.841 --> 1:17:55.717
So, no more proven settlements.

1:17:55.801 --> 1:17:58.762
Ambra Battilana Gutierrez
almost certainly settled.

1:17:58.846 --> 1:18:00.931
And John Schmidt confirmed
that Miramax settled

1:18:01.014 --> 1:18:02.391
with the woman I visited
in Queens.

1:18:02.474 --> 1:18:04.768
Anything more on the article
from The New Yorker?

1:18:04.852 --> 1:18:05.853
No.

1:18:06.770 --> 1:18:09.815
Lanny Davis and David Boies
wanna come to talk to us.

1:18:10.607 --> 1:18:11.608
What do you think?

1:18:11.692 --> 1:18:15.362
Don't we wanna wait and push for
an on-the-record interview with Weinstein?

1:18:15.445 --> 1:18:16.947
It's your call, Binky.

1:18:17.030 --> 1:18:20.617
I'd like to talk to Lanny, at least.
See what he has to say.

1:18:21.410 --> 1:18:23.120
[Lanny] Harvey's not always that rational.

1:18:23.203 --> 1:18:26.832
The reason I'm here as his representative
is not to try to kill anything.

1:18:26.915 --> 1:18:30.961
I wanna know that if you're including
something like Rósa McGowan's claim,

1:18:31.044 --> 1:18:32.296
then we can defend that.

1:18:32.379 --> 1:18:33.422
[Rebecca] Of course.

1:18:34.173 --> 1:18:35.174
Please.

1:18:38.844 --> 1:18:41.263
I know you'll be investigating
with due diligence.

1:18:42.723 --> 1:18:45.392
Lanny, you'll have every chance
to respond.

1:18:47.603 --> 1:18:49.605
-Uh--
-And I trust it's okay to record this?

1:18:49.688 --> 1:18:50.856
Oh, of course. Sure.

1:18:52.149 --> 1:18:56.069
I don't expect you to name sources,
but if it's possible for you

1:18:56.153 --> 1:18:59.865
to let me know overall
what your story's about?

1:18:59.948 --> 1:19:03.368
We're looking into problematic behavior
towards women by Weinstein.

1:19:04.369 --> 1:19:05.370
Okay.

1:19:07.164 --> 1:19:10.751
Harvey adamantly denies
any allegation of rape or assault.

1:19:10.834 --> 1:19:12.085
Nothing criminal.

1:19:13.045 --> 1:19:16.757
But he is aware of complaints
about his treatment of women,

1:19:16.840 --> 1:19:19.051
and he is working on that.

1:19:20.052 --> 1:19:22.679
Powerful men of
an older generation

1:19:23.472 --> 1:19:26.892
are changing their understanding
of the meaning of the word "consensual."

1:19:26.975 --> 1:19:31.647
Why women don't feel it's consensual
even if a man convinces himself it is.

1:19:32.689 --> 1:19:34.149
Do you wanna expand on that?

1:19:35.025 --> 1:19:39.947
Uh, I believe there's a story to be told
about the evolution of men,

1:19:40.030 --> 1:19:42.533
and, in particular, Harvey,
on this subject.

1:19:43.575 --> 1:19:45.661
Would he be willing to talk to us
about it?

1:19:45.744 --> 1:19:47.079
On the record?

1:19:48.789 --> 1:19:52.251
He has to deal with his wife and children
before anything else.

1:19:53.502 --> 1:19:57.673
You're adamant Rose McGowan's
rape accusation is false.

1:19:58.382 --> 1:19:59.383
Why is that?

1:20:00.634 --> 1:20:03.637
Did she tell anybody right away?
Did she show any signs of distress?

1:20:03.720 --> 1:20:06.306
She told her manager and a lawyer.

1:20:08.684 --> 1:20:11.311
Harvey was aware that
there was a problem with Rose,

1:20:11.395 --> 1:20:14.481
but not that she was accusing him
of rape.

1:20:14.565 --> 1:20:16.525
So I draw a bright line
on the word "rape."

1:20:16.608 --> 1:20:18.110
Anything below that line,

1:20:19.027 --> 1:20:21.780
uh, he was aware of feelings, concerns.

1:20:22.364 --> 1:20:23.323
Of what kind?

1:20:23.991 --> 1:20:24.992
I'm sorry. What--

1:20:25.075 --> 1:20:28.662
If the concerns were not about rape,
what were they about?

1:20:30.747 --> 1:20:32.833
The only way I can answer is, uh…

1:20:35.169 --> 1:20:40.132
a sense of exploitation because of
that disparate power relationship.

1:20:41.216 --> 1:20:45.262
There's mental coercion
that isn't physical coercion.

1:20:45.345 --> 1:20:49.183
Lisa Bloom has been working with Harvey
to help him recognize the difference.

1:20:49.266 --> 1:20:51.685
-Lisa Bloom?
-Yeah.

1:20:53.145 --> 1:20:58.150
If Harvey had been made aware of
McGowan's concerns at the time,

1:20:58.233 --> 1:20:59.902
how did he respond?

1:21:01.403 --> 1:21:03.864
I think he had dealings legally with her
about them.

1:21:04.907 --> 1:21:07.534
And how would you characterize
those legal dealings?

1:21:10.162 --> 1:21:14.291
I think he became aware that she did not
regard what happened as okay with her.

1:21:14.374 --> 1:21:15.584
I'm not talking about rape.

1:21:15.667 --> 1:21:19.588
I'm talking about the effect he had
on Rose McGowan.

1:21:20.214 --> 1:21:22.466
And that rather than fighting…

1:21:23.884 --> 1:21:26.094
"Rather than fighting"? Then…

1:21:27.054 --> 1:21:28.055
Then what?

1:21:31.350 --> 1:21:34.019
I think he has agreed to settlements

1:21:34.102 --> 1:21:36.730
rather than litigating
what might have been litigated.

1:21:36.813 --> 1:21:39.483
As Harvey saw it, it was better to settle,

1:21:39.566 --> 1:21:41.443
even if you haven't done anything wrong.

1:21:42.069 --> 1:21:43.487
He preferred "to settle"?

1:21:45.531 --> 1:21:49.451
Were there other cases of
questionable intimate relations with women

1:21:49.535 --> 1:21:51.119
in which Weinstein settled?

1:21:53.789 --> 1:21:55.040
Let's say for now,

1:21:56.041 --> 1:21:57.459
even on a background basis,

1:21:57.543 --> 1:21:59.962
that I need to find out
what my limits are legally.

1:22:00.546 --> 1:22:04.216
Even if on background,
I'm confirming settlements.

1:22:04.299 --> 1:22:07.928
But the answer is, yes, there have been.

1:22:11.056 --> 1:22:12.140
How many?

1:22:14.810 --> 1:22:15.811
No.

1:22:17.729 --> 1:22:18.939
[chuckles]

1:22:19.022 --> 1:22:22.901
To admit to settlements this early,
they're in real trouble.

1:22:22.985 --> 1:22:25.988
We need to find out a number.
We need to corroborate each one.

1:22:26.071 --> 1:22:27.865
-I'm on it.
-[cell phone buzzes]

1:22:27.948 --> 1:22:30.534
Have you guys had any dealings
with Diana Filip?

1:22:31.493 --> 1:22:32.327
No.

1:22:32.411 --> 1:22:34.162
I said no to speaking
at a women's conference.

1:22:34.246 --> 1:22:35.539
She just keeps on calling me.

1:22:35.622 --> 1:22:37.124
Did you have her checked out?

1:22:37.207 --> 1:22:40.669
The security consultant says she's legit,
but who has time for these random people?

1:22:42.963 --> 1:22:44.590
[cell phone buzzing]

1:22:54.183 --> 1:22:55.350
Hello?

1:22:55.434 --> 1:22:59.229
[ex-Miramax employee] I worked at Miramax.
Talk to Irwin Reiter. He hates Weinstein.

1:22:59.313 --> 1:23:00.564
[line clicks]

1:23:05.277 --> 1:23:07.738
[cell phone buzzing]

1:23:10.657 --> 1:23:12.367
Hey. Are you okay?

1:23:12.451 --> 1:23:13.702
[Jodi] Did I wake you?

1:23:15.329 --> 1:23:17.497
Um, yeah. What's up?

1:23:18.498 --> 1:23:20.501
What do you know about Irwin Reiter?

1:23:22.336 --> 1:23:23.337
Hang on.

1:23:23.879 --> 1:23:25.464
I put together a file on him.

1:23:26.048 --> 1:23:28.592
I need to write a good fucking email.

1:23:40.604 --> 1:23:42.814
Hi. Thanks for meeting me.

1:23:43.524 --> 1:23:44.942
You wanna get me killed?

1:23:52.491 --> 1:23:53.742
So, Irwin,

1:23:54.618 --> 1:23:57.955
you've been an accountant
for the Weinsteins for 30 years.

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:05.420
I pick up the check, and I reserve
the right to leave after five minutes.

1:24:06.171 --> 1:24:07.464
So… [clears throat]

1:24:08.382 --> 1:24:09.758
…what do you wanna know?

1:24:09.842 --> 1:24:13.554
We have information on several settlements
that Weinstein made in the '90s.

1:24:13.637 --> 1:24:16.431
Paid to actresses
and ex-employees.

1:24:17.474 --> 1:24:19.393
Could you tell me anything
about that?

1:24:21.854 --> 1:24:24.189
Could you confirm
those settlements,

1:24:24.273 --> 1:24:26.316
and how it was
from your perspective?

1:24:26.400 --> 1:24:27.484
My "perspective"?

1:24:29.027 --> 1:24:31.530
Would it be company money
that was used?

1:24:32.948 --> 1:24:36.034
You wrote that
we're from the same tiny world.

1:24:36.118 --> 1:24:37.160
Yeah.

1:24:37.244 --> 1:24:39.454
Summers at bungalows
in the Catskills.

1:24:39.538 --> 1:24:42.249
Meals at Lefty's and Pop-Ins.
[chuckles]

1:24:42.332 --> 1:24:44.418
What do you remember
about those holidays?

1:24:45.085 --> 1:24:47.337
Gosh,
I remember so many things.

1:24:48.463 --> 1:24:51.425
It's the first time I remember seeing
my grandmother's arms bare.

1:24:52.509 --> 1:24:56.013
I knew those tattoos
meant something seismic.

1:24:56.930 --> 1:24:58.724
Yeah, how did you know?

1:24:58.807 --> 1:25:00.267
I just sensed it.

1:25:01.226 --> 1:25:03.061
Did your family discuss it?

1:25:07.399 --> 1:25:08.817
Who else are you talking to?

1:25:09.443 --> 1:25:11.236
I can't disclose that, Irwin.

1:25:14.031 --> 1:25:17.034
You know, my parents--
they couldn't go there.

1:25:17.117 --> 1:25:19.119
They rarely discussed it.

1:25:20.913 --> 1:25:22.706
It's so mysterious, isn't it?

1:25:23.790 --> 1:25:25.876
Why some families talk.

1:25:25.959 --> 1:25:27.211
Some don't.

1:25:29.463 --> 1:25:34.259
The money Weinstein was spending
was, you know, crazy.

1:25:34.343 --> 1:25:38.096
I tried. I tried many times
to get the board to do something about it,

1:25:38.180 --> 1:25:42.559
but they just kept ignoring his behavior
and keeping him on.

1:25:42.643 --> 1:25:43.977
Why is that?

1:25:45.812 --> 1:25:47.314
Have you talked to LOC?

1:25:49.024 --> 1:25:50.817
Or ZP?

1:25:50.901 --> 1:25:52.319
Who is "LOC"?

1:25:53.195 --> 1:25:54.530
There was this memo.

1:25:55.697 --> 1:25:58.492
Let me ask you something, Jodi,
that's really puzzling me.

1:25:59.326 --> 1:26:01.203
Why are you asking
about the '90s,

1:26:01.286 --> 1:26:04.831
when Weinstein has committed
so many more recent offenses?

1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:08.043
I gotta go.

1:26:08.919 --> 1:26:10.671
-I'll give you a call.
-Irwin.

1:26:44.079 --> 1:26:45.080
[Talia] Mom. [crying]

1:26:46.164 --> 1:26:47.374
I had a nightmare.

1:26:47.457 --> 1:26:48.917
Oh, honey. Come here.

1:26:54.131 --> 1:26:56.592
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

1:26:56.675 --> 1:26:58.177
It's okay. It's okay.

1:26:58.260 --> 1:27:02.848
I heard that Ambra Battilana Gutierrez
just got a seven-figure settlement.

1:27:02.931 --> 1:27:06.351
And that Weinstein now owns
the audio of the incident?

1:27:08.228 --> 1:27:10.230
These settlements, Lanny,

1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:12.441
what are we talking?

1:27:14.484 --> 1:27:17.404
I can't tell you that, Megan.
You know that.

1:27:17.487 --> 1:27:19.531
I'm not talking about naming you,
of course.

1:27:19.615 --> 1:27:22.409
It would just be
great for background.

1:27:23.076 --> 1:27:26.205
To know a number
of the other settlements

1:27:26.288 --> 1:27:27.664
that you're aware of.

1:27:28.332 --> 1:27:30.375
-I'm not a bad guy here.
-I know that.

1:27:30.459 --> 1:27:35.631
My profession is to get the facts
into the hands of reporters… [chuckles]

1:27:35.714 --> 1:27:38.217
…but, you know, I can't help.

1:27:41.178 --> 1:27:43.847
I keep getting 40 in my head.

1:27:43.931 --> 1:27:45.182
[sighs]

1:27:45.265 --> 1:27:47.100
Which would be ridiculous,
right?

1:27:50.312 --> 1:27:51.396
Right?

1:27:55.317 --> 1:27:56.318
It's not 40.

1:27:58.987 --> 1:28:02.866
Seriously, it's, uh,
less than 40.

1:28:02.950 --> 1:28:04.868
Well, good. That's a relief.

1:28:04.952 --> 1:28:06.203
Sure. [chuckles]

1:28:08.205 --> 1:28:09.206
So…

1:28:11.041 --> 1:28:14.795
less than half of 40,
then?

1:28:15.587 --> 1:28:17.381
-Check.
-Oh, and what the fuck, Lanny?

1:28:17.464 --> 1:28:19.967
We heard that Ronan Farrow
is working on a story.

1:28:20.050 --> 1:28:22.719
No, no. That is done. Over.

1:28:25.806 --> 1:28:28.016
I don't see you
as a bad guy, Lanny.

1:28:29.226 --> 1:28:31.395
I don't. I never have.
I respect you.

1:28:31.478 --> 1:28:33.021
I respect you.

1:28:34.773 --> 1:28:37.526
[sighs]

1:28:38.819 --> 1:28:40.779
This is all gonna come out,
Lanny.

1:28:41.780 --> 1:28:43.282
Publicly.

1:28:43.365 --> 1:28:44.700
Generally does.

1:28:45.951 --> 1:28:48.745
-Okay. [laughs]
-[laughs]

1:28:52.332 --> 1:28:53.792
What am I laughing about?

1:28:56.336 --> 1:28:58.547
[sighs] Oh, Megan.

1:28:59.840 --> 1:29:00.841
Lanny.

1:29:10.100 --> 1:29:11.810
I'd say eight to 12 settlements.

1:29:24.948 --> 1:29:26.617
And do you think that's normal?

1:29:28.035 --> 1:29:30.454
For men to make so many payoffs?

1:29:35.209 --> 1:29:37.211
I do. Yeah.

1:29:42.049 --> 1:29:43.759
It feels like we're so close.

1:29:44.384 --> 1:29:45.636
Do you think we'll get it?

1:29:45.719 --> 1:29:46.720
What if we don't?

1:29:48.222 --> 1:29:49.806
I'm having nightmares about him.

1:29:49.890 --> 1:29:51.266
Oh, my God.
I have them too.

1:29:51.350 --> 1:29:52.684
Yeah?

1:29:52.768 --> 1:29:57.189
I'm terrified we know all this,
and we might go to our graves knowing it.

1:29:58.065 --> 1:29:59.483
The story will run.

1:29:59.566 --> 1:30:02.402
My worry is people won't care.

1:30:03.237 --> 1:30:05.989
And he won't even be slowed down,
let alone stopped.

1:30:06.490 --> 1:30:08.867
It's like an ocean
of wrongdoing.

1:30:08.951 --> 1:30:11.578
I mean, can you imagine
how many Harveys there are out there?

1:30:11.662 --> 1:30:12.704
Every day?

1:30:14.081 --> 1:30:15.624
I sometimes wonder…

1:30:18.794 --> 1:30:20.629
when I had Mira,

1:30:21.380 --> 1:30:22.381
if--

1:30:23.632 --> 1:30:24.842
if all the trauma,

1:30:24.925 --> 1:30:29.221
not just in me, but in all
of the women I talked to,

1:30:29.304 --> 1:30:30.305
if it just--

1:30:31.098 --> 1:30:35.686
This darkness, this constant violence,
if it just sort of imploded?

1:30:37.145 --> 1:30:41.400
Maybe that's part of the depression
that hits women.

1:30:45.362 --> 1:30:47.698
Do you wish you hadn't signed up
for this story?

1:30:50.200 --> 1:30:51.368
Do you?

1:30:53.537 --> 1:30:54.538
No.

1:30:55.372 --> 1:30:56.623
No. [chuckles]

1:31:04.131 --> 1:31:07.593
[Jodi] The last time we met,
you mentioned a memo?

1:31:15.100 --> 1:31:18.270
It was from an ex-executive.

1:31:18.353 --> 1:31:20.522
And it was extensive, scathing.

1:31:20.606 --> 1:31:22.191
She sent it to the board.

1:31:22.274 --> 1:31:24.651
When was this?
How did they react?

1:31:24.735 --> 1:31:27.946
It was a short burst
of behind-doors mayhem, and then she left.

1:31:29.156 --> 1:31:31.074
What did her memo say?

1:31:31.158 --> 1:31:33.243
That the company
was a toxic environment.

1:31:35.746 --> 1:31:37.206
Would anyone have a copy?

1:31:37.289 --> 1:31:38.999
[laughs]

1:31:44.213 --> 1:31:45.214
Hey.

1:31:47.174 --> 1:31:49.635
-Sorry it's so late.
-Mmm.

1:31:53.555 --> 1:31:54.556
[Jodi] You okay?

1:31:55.432 --> 1:31:58.310
Uh, Talia was up late.
Violet woke up twice.

1:31:58.393 --> 1:32:02.231
I have an inbox filled with enraged people
about this insurance story

1:32:02.314 --> 1:32:03.982
which is going to be huge.

1:32:04.066 --> 1:32:07.569
There's already hundreds of emails here,

1:32:07.653 --> 1:32:11.448
and there is… [chuckles]
…a hurricane heading towards Florida.

1:32:11.532 --> 1:32:13.575
So, I am going to somehow fly down there

1:32:13.659 --> 1:32:17.579
and move my dad someplace else
before he is literally blown away.

1:32:17.663 --> 1:32:20.624
And I have a slight nervous twitch
in my eye.

1:32:20.707 --> 1:32:21.792
Let me see.

1:32:25.128 --> 1:32:26.630
[sighs]

1:32:26.922 --> 1:32:28.382
Can you get the raisin?

1:32:28.465 --> 1:32:30.801
[both laughing]

1:32:30.884 --> 1:32:34.054
-Hey! Hey! Holly!
-[chattering, laughing]

1:32:35.097 --> 1:32:37.266
-[cell phone ringing]
-Slow down.

1:32:37.349 --> 1:32:39.101
Here.
Will you hold Crabby for a second?

1:32:39.184 --> 1:32:40.310
Least they're having fun.

1:32:41.645 --> 1:32:43.438
Hi. This is Jodi Kantor.

1:32:43.522 --> 1:32:46.149
This is Rowena Chiu.
I'm in New York.

1:32:46.942 --> 1:32:48.819
Do you still want to meet up?

1:32:50.028 --> 1:32:51.280
I couldn't tell anyone.

1:32:51.989 --> 1:32:54.491
Not my parents.
Not even my husband.

1:32:55.284 --> 1:32:56.285
Why not?

1:32:58.370 --> 1:33:00.706
I grew up in an immigrant household.

1:33:00.789 --> 1:33:03.333
I was taught to keep my head down,

1:33:03.417 --> 1:33:06.587
work hard and not draw attention
to myself, you know?

1:33:07.462 --> 1:33:11.967
In Chinese culture, I felt
I had to protect my family at all costs.

1:33:12.634 --> 1:33:15.679
And I was young, scared.

1:33:18.682 --> 1:33:21.351
Can you tell me anything
about what happened in Venice?

1:33:24.313 --> 1:33:26.899
This is off the record, yeah?

1:33:30.903 --> 1:33:32.404
I had the evening shifts,

1:33:32.487 --> 1:33:34.823
going through notes
on screenplays with Harvey.

1:33:35.699 --> 1:33:37.242
One night, we were working,

1:33:37.326 --> 1:33:40.787
and he kept trying to touch me.

1:33:41.538 --> 1:33:45.959
I didn't want to make him angry.
He's a very big man.

1:33:47.127 --> 1:33:49.379
I kept trying
to get back to the notes.

1:33:49.463 --> 1:33:54.510
And that went on for a few hours,
just trying to avoid him.

1:33:54.593 --> 1:33:56.220
How did you do that?

1:33:57.846 --> 1:34:00.557
I would just fight him off.

1:34:02.017 --> 1:34:06.271
I'd worn two pairs of tights
to buy me some time if I ever needed it.

1:34:07.856 --> 1:34:09.775
But finally,

1:34:10.692 --> 1:34:13.070
he held me down.

1:34:14.112 --> 1:34:17.157
Not forcefully,
but like it was a game.

1:34:19.284 --> 1:34:21.995
Then he parted my legs.

1:34:23.497 --> 1:34:24.748
And he said…

1:34:26.792 --> 1:34:30.629
"Please, just one thrust,
and it'll all be over."

1:34:34.967 --> 1:34:36.343
I got away.

1:34:36.426 --> 1:34:38.178
I was traumatized.

1:34:38.262 --> 1:34:41.181
I was a Christian.
I was still with my first boyfriend.

1:34:42.641 --> 1:34:45.185
And you shared this with Zelda?

1:34:45.269 --> 1:34:49.481
Zelda was completely enraged
and very brave in facing him.

1:34:50.315 --> 1:34:51.650
We both resigned.

1:34:54.027 --> 1:34:56.446
But I couldn't get a new job
after leaving Miramax.

1:34:57.155 --> 1:35:00.200
Everyone kept saying
if I worked for Harvey, why would I leave?

1:35:01.827 --> 1:35:04.538
The NDA that we signed,

1:35:04.621 --> 1:35:08.500
it stipulated that if I ever had trouble
getting a job in film again,

1:35:09.334 --> 1:35:12.838
I was to go back to Harvey
or his lawyer, Hutensky, for help.

1:35:14.089 --> 1:35:17.259
I asked them for a reference,

1:35:17.342 --> 1:35:21.763
and Hutensky, he kept repeating…

1:35:24.099 --> 1:35:25.726
What? What was he saying?

1:35:28.729 --> 1:35:30.981
How much Harvey valued me.

1:35:35.652 --> 1:35:38.655
We agreed I would return to Miramax

1:35:39.281 --> 1:35:41.033
under strict conditions.

1:35:43.452 --> 1:35:46.288
So, I signed for Hong Kong.

1:35:47.664 --> 1:35:50.334
I thought he would
be far enough away.

1:35:51.168 --> 1:35:52.544
I thought I'd be okay.

1:35:55.631 --> 1:35:57.216
But it was horrible.

1:35:58.592 --> 1:35:59.676
I was a mess.

1:36:00.385 --> 1:36:03.055
I felt incredibly alone.

1:36:04.348 --> 1:36:06.517
I couldn't tell anyone about it,

1:36:06.600 --> 1:36:10.020
and the isolation just ate into me.

1:36:11.522 --> 1:36:13.357
[speaking Cantonese]

1:36:18.654 --> 1:36:20.614
[Rowena] One day I disappeared from work.

1:36:23.033 --> 1:36:24.785
I wanted to be dead.

1:36:26.537 --> 1:36:28.080
I didn't know how to be,

1:36:28.789 --> 1:36:31.625
how to keep going, living with it.

1:36:33.961 --> 1:36:35.671
I tried to kill myself,

1:36:36.463 --> 1:36:39.174
but I didn't know how.

1:36:39.258 --> 1:36:40.592
[chuckles]

1:36:41.176 --> 1:36:43.136
I felt I failed at even that.

1:36:48.016 --> 1:36:49.351
I wanna give you this.

1:36:51.144 --> 1:36:55.190
It's a description from an actress
you would know and recognize.

1:37:10.622 --> 1:37:11.623
What?

1:37:11.707 --> 1:37:15.502
This person won't go on the record.
I can't put her in the story.

1:37:24.428 --> 1:37:25.804
[stammering] I-- I didn't--

1:37:26.555 --> 1:37:29.391
I didn't know anything like this.

1:37:33.228 --> 1:37:35.939
I thought it was just
extramarital bullshit.

1:37:36.690 --> 1:37:37.774
It's not.

1:38:04.718 --> 1:38:06.178
Do with it what you want.

1:38:32.204 --> 1:38:33.747
[camera shutter clicking]

1:38:58.564 --> 1:39:00.607
-[cell phone dings]
-[CNN reporter] …not a single bit

1:39:00.691 --> 1:39:02.401
of aid or assistance,

1:39:02.484 --> 1:39:04.736
and it's about 45 minutes' drive…

1:39:04.820 --> 1:39:05.821
Shit.

1:39:06.405 --> 1:39:07.406
This is it.

1:39:08.574 --> 1:39:09.700
This is it.

1:39:09.783 --> 1:39:11.535
[cell phone dings]

1:39:17.541 --> 1:39:21.170
[Lauren O'Connor] For your records.
November 3rd, 2015.

1:39:21.920 --> 1:39:26.425
I have experienced repeated harassment
and abuse from the head of this company.

1:39:27.259 --> 1:39:31.180
I am a 28-year-old woman
trying to make a living and a career.

1:39:31.847 --> 1:39:33.599
I am a professional.

1:39:33.682 --> 1:39:36.310
I am sexualized and diminished.

1:39:36.393 --> 1:39:38.687
I have been fearful about speaking up,

1:39:38.770 --> 1:39:42.357
but remaining silent
is causing me great distress.

1:39:42.441 --> 1:39:44.276
He told me, "I'm a bad boy,

1:39:44.359 --> 1:39:47.029
but what's important
is that I'm honest about it."

1:39:47.112 --> 1:39:50.782
He said the only thing
I was good for was making babies.

1:39:50.866 --> 1:39:55.537
An assistant told me Harvey made her
give him a massage while he was naked.

1:39:55.621 --> 1:39:58.916
It was horrible to see her so upset.

1:39:58.999 --> 1:40:02.586
When I complained
to their human resources executive,

1:40:02.669 --> 1:40:08.300
the response was, "Let us know if
he hits you or crosses a line physically."

1:40:08.383 --> 1:40:12.971
Harvey Weinstein is
a 64-year-old world-famous man,

1:40:13.055 --> 1:40:15.349
and this is his company.

1:40:15.432 --> 1:40:20.521
The balance of power is me, zero,
Harvey Weinstein, ten.

1:40:30.739 --> 1:40:31.865
Go write.

1:40:31.949 --> 1:40:33.075
[Matt] You've got the story.

1:40:33.158 --> 1:40:34.785
Once we publish,
everything else will come out.

1:40:34.868 --> 1:40:37.037
-And talk to Lauren O'Connor.
-Yeah.

1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:39.540
Get ahold of the Weinstein Company board
for their response.

1:40:39.623 --> 1:40:41.583
Let me call Lance Maerov.

1:40:41.667 --> 1:40:43.085
Write it. Let's get ready.

1:40:46.755 --> 1:40:49.007
[lawyer]
My client does not want to be named.

1:40:49.091 --> 1:40:51.677
That memo was never
for public distribution.

1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:52.761
[Rebecca] Lauren.

1:40:53.470 --> 1:40:56.598
[lawyer] My client is here,
but she's too upset to speak.

1:40:56.682 --> 1:40:59.434
Lauren, I'm sorry
this is difficult for you.

1:40:59.518 --> 1:41:01.687
We're not gonna publish the whole memo.

1:41:01.770 --> 1:41:04.898
And we will make it absolutely clear
you were not the source

1:41:04.982 --> 1:41:06.608
and that you declined to comment.

1:41:07.359 --> 1:41:10.571
But we do intend to use your name
for its credibility.

1:41:11.196 --> 1:41:15.117
If you were a victim of sexual assault,
we would absolutely keep your anonymity.

1:41:15.826 --> 1:41:17.661
But as a witness to what went on,

1:41:17.744 --> 1:41:21.123
it would make this story much stronger
to name you.

1:41:21.206 --> 1:41:24.084
Hi, Lance. This is Megan Twohey
from The New York Times.

1:41:24.168 --> 1:41:27.379
We have a memo here from Lauren O'Connor
to The Weinstein Company.

1:41:27.462 --> 1:41:28.881
What? Shit.

1:41:28.964 --> 1:41:30.424
We wanna know,
what did you do about it?

1:41:30.507 --> 1:41:32.259
What did the board do about it?

1:41:37.723 --> 1:41:38.724
Lance?

1:41:39.725 --> 1:41:43.187
We did try to change things
with the police complaint in 2015.

1:41:43.270 --> 1:41:46.023
What about this memo?
It was there and then it was gone?

1:41:46.106 --> 1:41:49.526
Look, we were all worried
about Harvey's behavior.

1:41:49.610 --> 1:41:51.445
Can I quote you, Lance?

1:41:54.489 --> 1:41:55.490
Yes.

1:41:56.116 --> 1:41:57.743
Yes, you can.

1:41:58.452 --> 1:42:00.120
So, Lauren's complaint?

1:42:03.373 --> 1:42:06.752
It was withdrawn days after it was sent.

1:42:06.835 --> 1:42:08.045
So, yeah, I let it go.

1:42:08.128 --> 1:42:10.088
Well, why do you think it was withdrawn?

1:42:10.881 --> 1:42:12.341
I really don't know why.

1:42:13.592 --> 1:42:16.553
Look, are you sure
that this isn't just young women

1:42:16.637 --> 1:42:19.431
who wanna sleep with a movie producer
to try to get ahead?

1:42:20.682 --> 1:42:22.851
We have decades of allegations,

1:42:23.435 --> 1:42:26.772
accusations of harassment,
assault, rape,

1:42:26.855 --> 1:42:28.607
and multiple settlements.

1:42:31.485 --> 1:42:33.320
I know you're gonna need to
speak to the board,

1:42:33.403 --> 1:42:35.197
but could you wait
until after the weekend?

1:42:36.823 --> 1:42:37.908
Is that possible?

1:42:38.534 --> 1:42:39.743
[clears throat]

1:42:40.827 --> 1:42:41.828
Okay.

1:42:51.129 --> 1:42:52.130
[Jodi] Ashley,

1:42:52.798 --> 1:42:55.592
I know that ideally a lot of women
would be jumping together,

1:42:55.676 --> 1:42:57.135
but that's not what's happening.

1:42:58.554 --> 1:43:02.516
But we do have a series of incidents
and a predatory pattern.

1:43:03.141 --> 1:43:05.018
You would be coming forward alone,

1:43:05.102 --> 1:43:07.938
but you would be standing
on a mountain of evidence.

1:43:11.650 --> 1:43:12.693
Ashley?

1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:16.530
Yes. I'll think about it
very seriously, Jodi.

1:43:17.197 --> 1:43:18.532
I promise.

1:43:18.615 --> 1:43:19.867
Thank you, Ashley.

1:43:20.492 --> 1:43:21.660
[line clicks]

1:43:24.204 --> 1:43:25.747
[Dean] We go with what we have.

1:43:25.831 --> 1:43:28.375
I know we need to be mindful
of The New Yorker,

1:43:28.458 --> 1:43:31.962
but couldn't we wait just a little longer,
just for these women to commit?

1:43:32.045 --> 1:43:33.714
No. We need to publish.

1:43:33.797 --> 1:43:35.632
It's nothing like the whole story.

1:43:35.716 --> 1:43:38.844
This can be the first arrow.
More women will come forward afterwards.

1:43:39.595 --> 1:43:41.763
It could be
so much stronger, Dean.

1:43:42.347 --> 1:43:43.348
It's solid.

1:43:44.141 --> 1:43:45.267
We need to go.

1:43:45.851 --> 1:43:49.354
How much time will we give Weinstein
to respond?

1:43:49.438 --> 1:43:50.480
Twenty-four hours?

1:43:50.564 --> 1:43:51.607
[Rebecca] I'd double it.

1:43:52.191 --> 1:43:54.026
Forty-eight hours. That's fair.

1:43:54.109 --> 1:43:55.110
[Dean] Two days?

1:43:55.194 --> 1:43:57.404
How many people could
Harvey and his team talk to

1:43:57.487 --> 1:43:58.655
in that amount of time?

1:44:00.324 --> 1:44:01.325
David?

1:44:02.242 --> 1:44:03.702
I'd go with Rebecca.

1:44:03.785 --> 1:44:06.163
We want to be irreproachable
from the legal side.

1:44:06.246 --> 1:44:07.831
[Dean] Good. Let's call Lanny.

1:44:07.915 --> 1:44:10.626
We'll ask to speak to Harvey
and his team at one o'clock tomorrow.

1:44:10.709 --> 1:44:11.877
We'll tell them what we have

1:44:12.461 --> 1:44:16.340
and give him, uh,
two days to respond or refute.

1:44:26.892 --> 1:44:29.186
It's midnight. Go home.

1:44:29.269 --> 1:44:30.646
-We will.
-Good night.

1:44:30.729 --> 1:44:32.564
[typing]

1:44:49.873 --> 1:44:52.626
If just one of the women
would have gone on the record…

1:44:53.126 --> 1:44:54.753
Why is he taking the tunnel?

1:44:56.255 --> 1:44:58.715
We just needed one woman.

1:44:58.799 --> 1:45:00.509
Jodi. Stop it.

1:45:01.176 --> 1:45:02.177
Let it go.

1:45:09.059 --> 1:45:11.979
Maybe if we had been able to
get them all into a room together.

1:45:13.689 --> 1:45:15.524
A room would make no difference.

1:45:16.859 --> 1:45:19.319
They don't wanna go on the record
by themselves.

1:45:21.530 --> 1:45:23.073
Would you want to?

1:45:33.375 --> 1:45:35.460
[sighs]

1:45:41.925 --> 1:45:42.926
[whispers] Hi.

1:45:45.804 --> 1:45:46.889
Yeah.

1:45:47.681 --> 1:45:48.682
Hi.

1:45:49.183 --> 1:45:50.184
Hi.

1:45:50.267 --> 1:45:52.936
Shh, shh, shh, shh…

1:45:53.020 --> 1:45:55.689
-[cooing]
-Shh, shh, shh, shh…

1:46:02.529 --> 1:46:04.448
It's been two fucking hours.

1:46:05.949 --> 1:46:06.950
It's a tactic,

1:46:07.576 --> 1:46:10.037
but I have things to do.

1:46:14.875 --> 1:46:16.668
[phone ringing]

1:46:22.341 --> 1:46:23.342
Hello?

1:46:23.425 --> 1:46:27.638
[secretary] Dean? I have Harvey Weinstein
and his lawyer, Charles Harder, for you.

1:46:28.430 --> 1:46:29.723
Okay, let's go, team.

1:46:31.099 --> 1:46:32.893
-You ready?
-We're ready.

1:46:34.478 --> 1:46:35.521
Put them through.

1:46:39.733 --> 1:46:41.151
Harvey?

1:46:41.235 --> 1:46:42.528
Charles?

1:46:42.611 --> 1:46:43.612
[Charles] Dean.

1:46:44.488 --> 1:46:46.114
How do you wanna do this,
Harvey?

1:46:46.782 --> 1:46:48.659
[Harvey] I don't wanna do this,
is what I want.

1:46:48.742 --> 1:46:51.161
Are they there?
The reporters?

1:46:51.245 --> 1:46:52.538
We're all here.

1:46:53.121 --> 1:46:54.498
[Harvey] Who have you talked to?

1:46:55.832 --> 1:46:58.544
We've sent you
who we're covering, Harvey.

1:46:58.627 --> 1:47:00.295
Who have you talked to?

1:47:00.379 --> 1:47:02.297
[chattering]

1:47:04.758 --> 1:47:05.843
[Megan] Harvey, we need some--

1:47:05.926 --> 1:47:07.469
[Harvey]
Are you talking to Gwyneth Paltrow?

1:47:07.553 --> 1:47:10.222
[Dean] Gwyneth's not in the story, Harvey.

1:47:10.305 --> 1:47:14.142
Why don't you tell me who's on the record
and let me respond to that?

1:47:14.226 --> 1:47:15.227
Yeah.

1:47:16.854 --> 1:47:20.691
Harvey, how many settlements
have you paid out over the years?

1:47:21.567 --> 1:47:23.610
We were told eight to 12.

1:47:23.694 --> 1:47:26.321
That's you talking. That's not me talking.

1:47:26.405 --> 1:47:30.325
If Lanny spoke, he spoke for himself
and not on behalf of his client.

1:47:34.788 --> 1:47:37.332
[Charles] How much time
are you giving us to respond?

1:47:37.416 --> 1:47:38.834
We need two weeks.

1:47:40.460 --> 1:47:42.004
You'll have two days.

1:47:42.087 --> 1:47:43.755
[Charles] This goes back to the '90s.

1:47:43.839 --> 1:47:46.175
[Harvey] If you mess up
and don't tell the truth,

1:47:46.258 --> 1:47:48.135
how do you look yourself in the eye?

1:47:48.218 --> 1:47:50.762
It's been 90 minutes, Harvey,
and we're gonna wrap it up now.

1:48:03.317 --> 1:48:05.569
[breathing heavily]

1:48:20.334 --> 1:48:22.836
[Dean] Harvey's just disputed
Lanny's eight to 12.

1:48:22.920 --> 1:48:24.171
We have to have corroboration.

1:48:24.254 --> 1:48:26.423
Eight to 12 settlements
has to be backed up.

1:48:27.382 --> 1:48:29.176
-Who can you call at the company?
-[cell phone ringing]

1:48:29.259 --> 1:48:30.886
I'll ask David Glasser.

1:48:30.969 --> 1:48:32.179
It's Ashley.

1:48:34.556 --> 1:48:36.266
Pick up. Answer it.

1:48:36.350 --> 1:48:37.392
I am. I am.

1:48:40.229 --> 1:48:41.271
Ashley.

1:48:42.648 --> 1:48:44.024
How are you?

1:48:44.107 --> 1:48:46.527
I'm good. Yeah. I'm good.
I just went for a run.

1:48:47.319 --> 1:48:49.947
[Jodi] That's great. That's great.
Running is good.

1:48:51.448 --> 1:48:52.658
I talked to my lawyer,

1:48:52.741 --> 1:48:55.619
and I've been thinking
about what the right thing to do is.

1:48:55.702 --> 1:48:57.204
Yeah. Of course.

1:48:57.788 --> 1:48:58.789
Of course.

1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:03.001
And?

1:49:05.963 --> 1:49:08.757
I'm prepared to be a named source
in your investigation.

1:49:10.217 --> 1:49:11.468
I have to…

1:49:12.553 --> 1:49:14.054
as a woman and a Christian.

1:49:20.185 --> 1:49:21.186
[exhales]

1:49:22.187 --> 1:49:23.188
[Ashley] Jodi?

1:49:24.231 --> 1:49:25.232
Yes.

1:49:26.024 --> 1:49:27.150
We'll speak soon.

1:49:29.194 --> 1:49:30.320
Yes.

1:49:30.404 --> 1:49:31.822
Ashley, thank you.

1:49:32.406 --> 1:49:33.490
Thank you.

1:49:35.826 --> 1:49:37.703
Ashley said yes. [crying]

1:49:38.287 --> 1:49:39.580
She said yes.

1:49:42.124 --> 1:49:43.125
Ashley said yes.

1:49:43.208 --> 1:49:45.919
She did, Jodi. She did. [laughs]

1:49:46.003 --> 1:49:49.381
Okay. Here we go
with the whole damn story.

1:49:49.464 --> 1:49:52.176
[Rebecca] The lede is Ashley Judd's
account of the Peninsula suite.

1:49:52.259 --> 1:49:54.261
Get a good Judd quote
to end the section.

1:49:54.344 --> 1:49:55.345
I'm on it.

1:49:55.429 --> 1:49:57.639
[Dean] We publish as soon as
the piece is in good shape.

1:49:57.723 --> 1:49:59.141
Let's go.

1:50:33.133 --> 1:50:34.760
[line ringing]

1:50:37.095 --> 1:50:38.472
-Hello?
-Hi, David.

1:50:38.555 --> 1:50:41.141
This is Megan Twohey
from The New York Times.

1:50:41.225 --> 1:50:44.228
I thought it was fair to give you,
as company president, a chance to comment.

1:50:44.311 --> 1:50:45.687
Are you up to speed with everything?

1:50:47.272 --> 1:50:48.440
I am.

1:50:48.524 --> 1:50:51.026
The board had
an emergency conference call.

1:50:51.735 --> 1:50:54.821
David, the eight to 12 settlements,
we have conflicting reports.

1:50:54.905 --> 1:50:55.948
We don't need to name you,

1:50:56.031 --> 1:50:58.825
but would you confirm for me
that eight to 12 is accurate?

1:50:58.909 --> 1:51:00.035
How many?

1:51:00.619 --> 1:51:03.372
Eight to 12.
Are we safe using that figure?

1:51:06.166 --> 1:51:07.543
Eight to 12.

1:51:10.796 --> 1:51:12.840
Uh, yeah. Yes. That's accurate.

1:51:13.423 --> 1:51:15.300
I appreciate it, David. Thank you.

1:51:16.426 --> 1:51:17.886
[elevator bell dings]

1:51:23.058 --> 1:51:24.393
[sighs]

1:51:38.282 --> 1:51:40.993
David Glasser says yes
to eight to 12 settlements.

1:51:43.370 --> 1:51:45.163
[both laughing]

1:51:45.247 --> 1:51:46.331
[Lanny] It's not enough time.

1:51:46.415 --> 1:51:47.791
-It's not just me here.
-[Megan] Right. Yeah.

1:51:47.875 --> 1:51:49.459
-You must know that, right?
-[Megan] Yep.

1:51:49.543 --> 1:51:51.003
I understand it's difficult.

1:51:51.962 --> 1:51:53.589
What's happening?
Is Harvey on the phone?

1:51:53.672 --> 1:51:56.341
It's Lanny. Weinstein is refusing
to give a response.

1:51:56.425 --> 1:51:57.759
-[Megan] Okay.
-[Lanny] Right?

1:51:57.843 --> 1:52:00.095
[Megan] Yeah.
No, Lanny, I hear you.

1:52:00.179 --> 1:52:02.931
Listen, I can't pull a rabbit
out of a hat here.

1:52:03.015 --> 1:52:04.516
We need more time.

1:52:04.600 --> 1:52:05.601
Here's the thing, Megan--

1:52:05.684 --> 1:52:06.852
Lanny, I'm sick of this shit.

1:52:06.935 --> 1:52:08.979
You've got five different lawyers
reaching out to us.

1:52:09.062 --> 1:52:11.064
We're not talking
to five different lawyers.

1:52:11.148 --> 1:52:14.610
Get your people in line
and get back to us with your response.

1:52:21.825 --> 1:52:23.702
This is not a response. This is a novel.

1:52:23.785 --> 1:52:26.663
They call the women liars
and the journalism false.

1:52:26.747 --> 1:52:28.707
It's legalistic bullying.

1:52:28.790 --> 1:52:31.376
I sent back three paragraphs
to counter their 18 pages.

1:52:31.460 --> 1:52:32.836
I've asked for their data.

1:52:32.920 --> 1:52:35.547
-And I invite them to court.
-Let's see how long

1:52:35.631 --> 1:52:37.674
-before they get back to us.
-[cell phone buzzes]

1:52:39.510 --> 1:52:40.677
Waiting time's up.

1:52:40.761 --> 1:52:42.804
Weinstein wants to meet.
He's on his way here.

1:52:43.388 --> 1:52:44.389
Do we let him in?

1:52:47.684 --> 1:52:48.685
Let him in.

1:52:49.478 --> 1:52:50.479
I've got this.

1:53:01.198 --> 1:53:02.449
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hi.

1:53:02.533 --> 1:53:03.992
-Is this everyone?
-Yep.

1:53:04.076 --> 1:53:05.369
[Megan] Okay, follow me.

1:53:09.790 --> 1:53:12.084
-That's what you're gonna do.
-Only five. Come on. We've got folders.

1:53:12.167 --> 1:53:13.752
We have the folders.
We've got evidence.

1:53:13.836 --> 1:53:15.587
You're a good writer, Megan.

1:53:15.671 --> 1:53:18.674
[Harvey] Are you really willing to stake
your reputation on this story?

1:53:18.757 --> 1:53:22.052
-She's smiling. Everybody looks happy.
-Would you smile if this happened to you?

1:53:22.135 --> 1:53:24.721
None of these women
are credible witnesses.

1:53:24.805 --> 1:53:26.056
How's this one?

1:53:26.139 --> 1:53:27.724
[Harvey] She's a nut.

1:53:27.808 --> 1:53:29.434
She's a shakedown artist.

1:53:29.518 --> 1:53:31.270
[chattering]

1:53:59.840 --> 1:54:01.383
[Jodi] Is it there? Is it online?

1:54:01.466 --> 1:54:03.468
Yes. They have it too.

1:54:03.552 --> 1:54:04.595
So it's in both.

1:54:06.847 --> 1:54:07.848
What happened?

1:54:08.974 --> 1:54:10.601
What you'd expect.

1:54:10.684 --> 1:54:12.603
Trying to discredit the actresses.

1:54:12.686 --> 1:54:13.687
What's wrong?

1:54:14.688 --> 1:54:17.941
Harvey and his team have spoken to
Variety and Hollywood Reporter.

1:54:18.567 --> 1:54:20.652
-What?
-About us and the story.

1:54:20.736 --> 1:54:23.614
He claims to be surprised by it.

1:54:24.364 --> 1:54:25.741
This is bad.

1:54:27.034 --> 1:54:30.120
You have to write fast.
We've just lost any privacy.

1:54:31.747 --> 1:54:33.373
Let me see the lede.

1:54:33.457 --> 1:54:34.791
[typing]

1:54:41.256 --> 1:54:43.842
[Jodi] All I think is
we have to lead with this.

1:54:43.926 --> 1:54:45.719
That has to be
at the top of the paragraph.

1:54:45.802 --> 1:54:48.138
-I think it's fine as two, don't you?
-[Rebecca] I think it's right.

1:54:50.265 --> 1:54:52.893
Go home. I'll check this.

1:54:55.103 --> 1:54:56.104
Really?

1:55:15.207 --> 1:55:16.959
[news anchor]
And they're really appealing to people.

1:55:17.042 --> 1:55:19.378
If you know anything,
please come forward.

1:55:33.141 --> 1:55:35.269
[Harvey] Why shouldn't I just do
a fucking interview right now

1:55:35.352 --> 1:55:38.522
with The Washington Post
based on your lack of transparency?

1:55:38.605 --> 1:55:41.483
You want some sort of list of
who we're talking to for this story,

1:55:41.567 --> 1:55:44.653
and if we don't disclose it to you,
you're threatening us?

1:55:44.736 --> 1:55:46.989
If you're using Gwyneth Paltrow, tell me.

1:55:47.072 --> 1:55:49.032
We're not using Gwyneth Paltrow.

1:55:49.116 --> 1:55:51.201
Are you talking to Gwyneth Paltrow?

1:55:52.911 --> 1:55:54.913
Hey, Harvey. This is Dean.
Here's the deal.

1:55:54.997 --> 1:55:58.000
You need to give us your statement now.
I'm about to push the button.

1:55:58.083 --> 1:56:00.502
Dean, let me tell you something
about intimidation.

1:56:00.586 --> 1:56:02.045
I'll talk to The Post. I will.

1:56:02.129 --> 1:56:03.672
Call them. That's fine.

1:56:03.755 --> 1:56:05.382
You can call The Post.

1:56:05.465 --> 1:56:07.301
Harvey, I'm trying to be fair with you.

1:56:07.384 --> 1:56:08.844
You are intimidating me, Dean.

1:56:08.927 --> 1:56:11.680
No, I'm trying to get your statement.
Please, give it to us now.

1:56:11.763 --> 1:56:13.765
We're about to publish.

1:56:13.849 --> 1:56:16.101
-I want to give it to you.
-Thank you.

1:56:16.185 --> 1:56:17.519
Is Gwyneth in it?

1:56:17.603 --> 1:56:19.104
[both] She's not in the story.

1:56:19.188 --> 1:56:21.440
So here's what
we need to do, Harvey.

1:56:22.274 --> 1:56:24.860
We wanna give you every word
that you wanna say.

1:56:25.652 --> 1:56:26.778
So say it.

1:56:27.446 --> 1:56:30.199
I also have a newspaper to put out.
I'm gonna walk out.

1:56:30.282 --> 1:56:32.284
Talk to my reporters.
Take care.

1:56:33.368 --> 1:56:34.411
Good luck.

1:56:34.494 --> 1:56:37.372
[Lisa] You have a reckless disregard
for the truth.

1:56:37.456 --> 1:56:41.084
You want a hit story,
and these allegations are false.

1:56:41.168 --> 1:56:43.462
We don't want
a hit story, Lisa.

1:56:43.545 --> 1:56:46.757
Harvey's going to take some time off
to focus on this issue.

1:56:48.383 --> 1:56:49.551
Are you, Harvey?

1:56:50.344 --> 1:56:52.679
[Harvey] Yes, I'm gonna take time off.

1:56:53.388 --> 1:56:54.890
From the company?

1:56:55.557 --> 1:56:58.560
Yes. I wanna spend some time learning.

1:56:58.644 --> 1:57:01.647
-[Lisa] Learning and listening to me.
-He's going to take a leave of absence.

1:57:02.523 --> 1:57:04.107
Double space here.

1:57:04.983 --> 1:57:06.985
-And here.
-[cell phone buzzing]

1:57:07.569 --> 1:57:08.654
It's Laura.

1:57:11.406 --> 1:57:13.450
Hi. Laura, how are you?

1:57:14.201 --> 1:57:17.287
Yes, I'm okay.

1:57:17.371 --> 1:57:18.455
Today's my surgery.

1:57:19.081 --> 1:57:20.707
I'm about to go in.

1:57:20.791 --> 1:57:25.045
Um, look, I never signed any contract.

1:57:25.838 --> 1:57:27.381
I'm not gagged,

1:57:28.090 --> 1:57:31.552
and I want to speak out
on behalf of the women who can't.

1:57:33.512 --> 1:57:34.721
I have three daughters,

1:57:34.805 --> 1:57:38.600
and I don't want them to
ever accept abuse or bullying as normal.

1:57:40.060 --> 1:57:42.563
You can use anything I've said.

1:57:43.230 --> 1:57:44.439
I'll do it.

1:57:45.607 --> 1:57:47.568
I'll go on the record.

1:57:49.862 --> 1:57:50.988
Thank you, Laura.

1:57:52.364 --> 1:57:53.365
Thank you.

1:57:55.075 --> 1:57:56.702
I'll be thinking of you.

1:58:01.540 --> 1:58:02.875
[sighs]

1:58:07.129 --> 1:58:08.922
-Oh, Laura.
-[laughs]

1:58:09.006 --> 1:58:11.049
Oh, beautiful,
beautiful Laura.

1:58:24.438 --> 1:58:25.898
[nurse]
Are you okay, Laura?

1:58:25.981 --> 1:58:28.483
[laughs] Yes. I'm fine.

1:58:28.567 --> 1:58:29.568
Thank you.

1:58:31.320 --> 1:58:32.696
I really am.
