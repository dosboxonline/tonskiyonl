00:54.640 --> 00:57.590
Ficus Religiosa
is a tree with an unusual life cycle.

00:57.710 --> 01:01.690
Its seeds, contained in bird
droppings, fall on other trees.

01:01.730 --> 01:05.620
Aerial roots spring up
and grow down to the floor.

01:05.690 --> 01:09.580
Then, the branches wrap around
the host tree and strangle it.

01:09.670 --> 01:13.510
Finally, the sacred fig
stands on its own.

04:19.530 --> 04:24.730
THE SEED OF THE SACRED FIG

05:00.560 --> 05:02.520
Thank you so much,

05:02.620 --> 05:03.660
I was going to bed.

05:03.700 --> 05:07.600
You haven't eaten since yesterday.
Have your breakfast first.

05:08.590 --> 05:10.600
Your prayer was finally answered.

05:12.550 --> 05:13.710
I'm so proud of you.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.560
I wish your father could see this.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.630
May he rest in peace.

05:21.670 --> 05:22.680
Iman...

05:23.620 --> 05:25.610
Will we be given
a three-bedroom apartment?

05:25.730 --> 05:28.700
- It'll be a while.
- We'll wait.

05:29.710 --> 05:34.510
The girls are too big
to share their bedroom.

05:34.710 --> 05:38.580
It's going to change our lives
to move.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.550
I was given this for self-defense.

05:55.560 --> 05:56.620
Why?

05:56.720 --> 05:58.630
To protect us.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.550
Try it.

06:05.670 --> 06:06.690
Hold it.

06:08.580 --> 06:10.540
No, I don't like it.

06:11.540 --> 06:13.640
Don't be scared, the safety is on.

06:14.540 --> 06:15.640
I'm not scared.

06:31.570 --> 06:32.620
It's heavy.

06:40.530 --> 06:41.650
Shall we tell the girls?

06:42.720 --> 06:44.540
Not yet.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.610
But it's the perfect moment.

06:46.650 --> 06:50.530
They'll be so proud to find out
their father has become a judge.

06:50.570 --> 06:52.550
Not a judge, an investigator.

06:52.590 --> 06:53.650
It doesn't matter.

06:53.690 --> 06:55.680
You'll be a judge soon.

06:56.510 --> 06:57.570
We'll see.

06:59.670 --> 07:02.600
It's important for them
to know these things.

07:02.640 --> 07:04.590
It will build their character.

07:04.660 --> 07:07.640
You know about
the revolutionary courts.

07:08.530 --> 07:09.650
They're unpopular.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.560
Yes, but it's been too long.

07:14.540 --> 07:17.570
You were waiting for an opportunity
to tell them about your work.

07:17.610 --> 07:19.570
This is the best one.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.620
We can go to a restaurant

07:24.660 --> 07:27.610
to celebrate your promotion.

07:27.650 --> 07:31.500
And we'll both talk to the girls.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.640
I'm not sure.

07:39.520 --> 07:40.650
Let me take care of this.

07:41.550 --> 07:43.520
- OK?
- OK.

07:46.690 --> 07:49.530
Sana, quiet, Dad's sleeping.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.510
It's no big deal if I'm not there.

07:51.550 --> 07:52.580
Impossible.

07:52.620 --> 07:55.540
It's important.
The four of us need to talk about it.

07:55.580 --> 07:56.670
So tell us now.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.660
I'm telling you
your father has to be present.

07:59.700 --> 08:02.510
It's both
a celebration and a meeting.

08:02.550 --> 08:03.720
- What celebration?
- You'll see.

08:04.520 --> 08:06.580
Please don't ruin my gathering.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.630
See your friends another day.

08:08.670 --> 08:11.550
Another day? It's her birthday.

08:11.590 --> 08:13.660
Then ask her to be born another day!

08:13.700 --> 08:14.700
Seriously.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.650
I can't postpone it,
we've been planning it for a while.

08:18.690 --> 08:21.670
Family must be your priority.

08:21.710 --> 08:25.640
What's this meeting-celebration
anyway?

08:25.680 --> 08:29.600
For the 20 years I've known your dad,
he's been dreaming of this.

08:30.520 --> 08:33.620
Stop the suspense!
Tell us what's happened.

08:33.710 --> 08:38.680
What if I told you
you'll each have your own bedroom?

08:38.720 --> 08:40.730
No kidding? Seriously?

08:41.530 --> 08:42.570
Hush, I said.

08:42.610 --> 08:43.710
Let's run to the restaurant.

08:44.550 --> 08:45.530
Bye!

08:56.730 --> 09:00.510
Thank you very much.

09:08.680 --> 09:11.630
A judge cannot rule

09:11.670 --> 09:15.600
without first gathering
information and evidence.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.580
Your job was
to gather that information?

09:19.670 --> 09:20.690
Yes.

09:21.580 --> 09:25.530
And why couldn't we know that?
You could have told us sooner.

09:25.570 --> 09:27.510
They must stay anonymous

09:27.550 --> 09:29.630
for their own safety
and that of their families.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.560
In each case,
there's a winner and a loser.

09:33.670 --> 09:37.630
The loser can always consider
he's been convicted unjustly

09:37.670 --> 09:39.620
and seek revenge.

09:39.730 --> 09:43.620
Now you're an investigating judge,
it's still dangerous.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.530
That's right, honey.

09:45.570 --> 09:47.610
But now you're big enough

09:47.650 --> 09:51.520
to understand his position
and be careful.

09:51.650 --> 09:52.720
Careful about what?

09:53.520 --> 09:57.590
You mean, to take revenge on him,
they might hurt us?

09:58.530 --> 09:59.610
It's possible.

10:00.570 --> 10:04.720
But we're going to move to a place
where the neighbors are like us.

10:05.520 --> 10:06.630
And they have kids.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.550
We'll be safe,

10:09.590 --> 10:11.510
the neighborhood is watched.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.620
You should respect certain things

10:13.660 --> 10:15.620
so as not to harm your father.

10:16.570 --> 10:17.640
Like what?

10:18.530 --> 10:20.540
Like the hijab.

10:20.580 --> 10:23.630
No photos of you on social media.

10:24.510 --> 10:26.590
You must be irreproachable.

10:26.630 --> 10:30.680
Anything you do
would be immediately denounced.

10:30.720 --> 10:35.560
You must watch your attitude,
your clothes, the places you go to,

10:35.640 --> 10:38.540
your friends, your words.

10:43.670 --> 10:46.560
Can you do your spoon trick?

10:46.610 --> 10:47.610
Sure.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.500
What's this?

11:20.550 --> 11:21.610
It's written on it.

11:22.730 --> 11:24.710
A five-volume case file.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.580
It takes time to investigate.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.570
I haven't even started.

11:29.670 --> 11:33.530
Don't bother, write down
the indictment and sign.

11:33.690 --> 11:35.590
It's the prosecutor's order.

11:36.670 --> 11:37.730
I can't.

11:39.650 --> 11:41.680
I've been working honorably
for 20 years.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.710
I took an oath.

11:54.730 --> 11:56.520
WIRETAPPED.

12:02.680 --> 12:06.680
I suggest you read the text
of the judges' oath again.

12:08.730 --> 12:11.500
Especially the last part.

12:13.680 --> 12:14.700
Lunchtime.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.540
Why do you think
you became an investigator?

12:35.580 --> 12:37.550
The boss doesn't like you.

12:40.570 --> 12:43.520
He was against your promotion.

12:44.570 --> 12:46.600
He wanted to have one of his guys.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.700
I was the one who insisted.

12:49.650 --> 12:52.700
He's watching for
the slightest misstep on your part.

12:57.580 --> 12:59.640
Do you want me to be challenged?

13:02.640 --> 13:06.620
Or compromise your own success
and your family's serenity?

13:13.560 --> 13:17.500
Do you know how many people
wanted this position?

13:20.700 --> 13:21.710
Iman...

13:23.630 --> 13:25.550
Here, you have to fight,

13:25.590 --> 13:27.610
you have to earn your stripes.

13:30.670 --> 13:34.570
Especially on a case
with an order from the prosecutor.

13:41.730 --> 13:44.560
I haven't even read the file.

13:44.660 --> 13:46.700
How can I indict him
of offense against God

13:47.500 --> 13:48.710
and ask for a death sentence?

14:26.590 --> 14:27.660
How's that?

14:28.560 --> 14:29.650
It's great.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.510
The shoulders fit badly.

14:33.570 --> 14:34.720
And it's loose in the front.

14:35.550 --> 14:36.660
- Shall I tell her?
- Sure.

14:37.670 --> 14:38.730
- Madam...
- Yes?

14:39.530 --> 14:42.530
Thank you, it's very nice,

14:42.570 --> 14:44.660
but the shoulders fit badly.

14:44.730 --> 14:46.680
And the front is loose,

14:46.720 --> 14:49.500
it hides her chest.

14:49.540 --> 14:52.660
One, this isn't the chest,
it's boobs.

14:52.700 --> 14:56.660
Two, her shoulders
will be hidden by the veil.

14:56.700 --> 14:59.660
It's true
but can you please fix this?

14:59.700 --> 15:01.530
Young lady,

15:01.570 --> 15:03.700
this is a uniform,
not an evening gown.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.710
Why wouldn't a uniform look good?

15:07.510 --> 15:08.630
OK, take if off.

15:09.690 --> 15:11.620
Can you also tighten the front?

15:11.660 --> 15:14.690
OK, but if they bug her at school,
don't complain to me.

15:15.530 --> 15:16.660
Sadaf, forget it.

15:16.700 --> 15:19.650
No! I hate loose clothes.

15:20.540 --> 15:23.530
OK, then, please tighten it a bit.

15:23.570 --> 15:24.640
OK, I'll see to it.

15:25.540 --> 15:26.610
When will it be ready?

15:26.650 --> 15:28.670
Call me next week.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.730
School is starting next week!

15:32.570 --> 15:34.520
What can I do? I'm busy.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.540
Hello?

15:35.710 --> 15:37.620
Hi, Mom.

15:45.650 --> 15:48.580
Isn't it hard to be away?

15:48.620 --> 15:52.530
It's a bit hard
to be in a college dorm,

15:52.570 --> 15:54.690
but at the same time, it's cool.

15:55.520 --> 15:59.510
You make new friends,
meet all kinds of people.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.560
You become more independent.

16:02.600 --> 16:06.510
Your mom's brave to let you go.

16:06.550 --> 16:07.580
That was delicious.

16:07.620 --> 16:09.530
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

16:09.570 --> 16:10.730
- You had enough?
- Yes.

16:11.530 --> 16:12.700
At the beginning,

16:13.600 --> 16:15.680
my mom was a bit worried

16:15.720 --> 16:18.700
but now that I'm settled, she's OK.

16:20.650 --> 16:22.730
- How many are you in a dorm?
- Eight.

16:23.530 --> 16:25.550
So cool, I wanna go there too.

16:26.620 --> 16:29.730
Then Amir called and a red heart
appeared on the screen.

16:30.530 --> 16:32.640
I added it to his contact.

16:32.680 --> 16:34.680
My mom said: who's that?

16:34.720 --> 16:36.660
I said: a classmate.

16:36.700 --> 16:40.560
She said: do you put red hearts
for all your classmates?

16:40.730 --> 16:43.510
I didn't know what to say.

16:43.550 --> 16:46.680
And then, she said:
let me see what he's like.

16:47.560 --> 16:48.600
I said...

16:48.640 --> 16:51.540
She wanted to see him?
She's so laid-back.

16:51.580 --> 16:52.700
- Rezvan?
- Yes?

16:53.500 --> 16:54.640
- Come here.
- OK.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.580
- I'll be right back.
- OK.

16:56.680 --> 16:58.500
Sana, go help.

17:01.620 --> 17:05.610
You should have put a white heart,
she wouldn't have suspected you.

17:08.650 --> 17:09.670
Yes, Mom?

17:10.610 --> 17:12.570
Your friend had lunch,

17:13.510 --> 17:15.700
serve her tea and off she goes.

17:18.640 --> 17:20.510
What do you mean?

17:21.590 --> 17:23.700
I told you about her situation.

17:24.610 --> 17:28.520
The dorm is not ready.
She knows nobody in Tehran.

17:28.610 --> 17:30.570
You want to kick her out?

17:30.710 --> 17:34.710
If she didn't know you,
what would she do?

17:35.540 --> 17:36.590
She knows me.

17:38.730 --> 17:41.550
This is what I meant.

17:41.590 --> 17:45.580
Our life has changed,
we have to be very careful.

17:45.620 --> 17:46.670
About what?

17:46.730 --> 17:48.570
Our entourage.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.610
What danger would Sadaf
represent for us?

17:51.650 --> 17:54.630
Why do you think
my problem is Sadaf?

17:54.730 --> 17:58.700
I'm telling you
we have to change our lifestyle.

17:59.710 --> 18:03.700
If it's hard for you to tell her,
I'll talk to her.

18:06.530 --> 18:08.660
I'll talk to Dad.

18:08.730 --> 18:11.660
I'll ask him to let Sadaf stay.

18:12.540 --> 18:15.540
Your father doesn't even know
who she is.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.530
He's very busy, don't disturb him.

18:20.570 --> 18:22.660
He's left all this up to me.

18:26.680 --> 18:29.520
Let her spend the afternoon here.

18:30.540 --> 18:33.680
I'll tell her in the meantime
that she has to leave.

18:34.590 --> 18:35.610
OK?

18:38.710 --> 18:41.590
OK, if it's just for the afternoon.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.730
- Rezvan...
- Yes?

18:55.570 --> 18:57.580
Why is it so important to you?

18:58.550 --> 19:01.510
She's my friend, I promised her.

19:01.550 --> 19:02.720
She's very lonely here.

19:03.690 --> 19:06.610
What if you put her up tonight

19:06.650 --> 19:09.640
and then again,
her dorm is not ready?

19:09.680 --> 19:11.600
It will be ready tomorrow.

19:11.640 --> 19:14.520
It's planned, I promise you.

19:14.560 --> 19:18.620
I really didn't think you'd mind
having her one night.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.690
That's why I offered.

19:23.590 --> 19:26.500
She can stay on two conditions.

19:27.660 --> 19:28.680
Which ones?

19:28.720 --> 19:32.610
First, never ask me
this kind of favor again.

19:33.520 --> 19:34.630
Second, make sure

19:34.670 --> 19:38.640
between the time Dad comes home
tonight and when he leaves tomorrow,

19:38.680 --> 19:40.720
Sadaf doesn't come out
of the bedroom.

19:41.520 --> 19:43.610
I can't lock her in!

19:43.680 --> 19:45.640
She can't see your father.

19:49.710 --> 19:50.710
OK.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.600
Mom, my eyebrows are still too thick.

19:57.660 --> 20:00.550
Can you make the end thinner?

20:00.590 --> 20:02.680
So you look like a slut?

20:02.720 --> 20:04.670
I have thin eyebrows

20:04.710 --> 20:06.690
but I'm a good girl!

20:07.530 --> 20:11.580
I'm sorry,
that's not what I meant!

20:11.620 --> 20:14.630
Rezvan has to respect
her family's rules.

20:14.670 --> 20:16.650
When she gets married,

20:16.690 --> 20:18.600
she'll see with her husband.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.650
Sure, she'll respect his rules.

20:21.690 --> 20:24.570
- When will I live for myself?
- Don't move.

20:24.610 --> 20:27.570
Mind you,
natural eyebrows are fashionable.

20:27.610 --> 20:29.650
Are you really plucking them?

20:29.690 --> 20:31.550
I can't feel anything.

20:31.590 --> 20:33.550
Of course I'm plucking them.

20:33.590 --> 20:35.730
Did you see the photo I sent you?

20:36.530 --> 20:37.730
Yeah, it was beautiful.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.650
Mom, can I get some highlights soon?

20:40.690 --> 20:43.610
What's next?
With this beautiful hair you have...

20:43.650 --> 20:45.710
Sadaf is saying
natural is fashionable.

20:46.510 --> 20:48.580
For eyebrows.

20:48.620 --> 20:51.530
I'll dye my hair blue this summer.

20:51.570 --> 20:54.690
Go ahead, and I'll blacklist you.

20:54.730 --> 20:57.650
Remove your nail polish
before your dad comes.

20:57.690 --> 21:00.540
I don't want problems.

21:00.580 --> 21:01.690
What's wrong with you?

21:02.530 --> 21:05.690
You dye your hair
and paint your nails.

21:05.730 --> 21:08.650
Being a young girl
and a married woman

21:08.690 --> 21:10.630
are different things.

21:13.640 --> 21:14.630
What?

21:15.560 --> 21:17.530
Nothing, I'm showing her my nails.

21:17.570 --> 21:19.500
Is that so funny?

21:19.650 --> 21:20.700
They look good.

21:21.500 --> 21:22.580
It's Dad.

21:22.660 --> 21:23.690
Yes, Iman?

21:26.520 --> 21:28.570
Doesn't your mom like me?

21:29.600 --> 21:31.630
Whatever.

21:31.670 --> 21:34.520
She's constantly teasing me.

21:34.560 --> 21:36.580
She's worrying
about this little pest.

21:37.710 --> 21:41.630
Who's the hottest one here?

21:42.550 --> 21:43.700
Ready, girls?

22:15.530 --> 22:17.560
Why are you home so late?

22:18.560 --> 22:19.660
You OK?

22:34.520 --> 22:35.550
Iman...

22:38.520 --> 22:39.540
Iman...

23:46.550 --> 23:48.670
Have some of this,
it'll do you good.

23:52.610 --> 23:54.660
Why don't you say anything?

23:59.570 --> 24:02.550
They think
they can make me do anything.

24:04.530 --> 24:05.530
Who?

24:10.560 --> 24:13.530
My predecessor was fired

24:13.570 --> 24:16.630
because he refused to sign
a death indictment.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.700
Did they ask you to do something?

24:32.700 --> 24:36.510
To sign the same indictment.

24:38.580 --> 24:39.660
Is it unjust?

24:42.560 --> 24:43.610
I don't know.

24:46.550 --> 24:47.680
Do not sign.

24:52.510 --> 24:53.700
It's the prosecutor's order.

24:54.730 --> 24:56.670
I have to obey to it.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.730
If the prosecutor has given an order,

25:08.530 --> 25:10.680
it's not in your hands, is it?

25:12.530 --> 25:14.570
It's his responsibility.

25:18.630 --> 25:20.570
That's what Ghaderi says.

25:21.590 --> 25:23.600
That's a first instance judgment,

25:24.510 --> 25:26.510
it can be contested.

25:26.550 --> 25:29.520
There can be an appeal

25:29.600 --> 25:30.720
or a plea procedure.

25:33.620 --> 25:35.670
So why are you upset?

25:45.650 --> 25:48.670
I'll get you something
that helps with sleep.

27:18.620 --> 27:19.680
Hello?

27:20.610 --> 27:22.620
Hi, are you feeling better?

27:24.610 --> 27:28.640
Sorry I didn't wake up
to prepare your breakfast.

27:31.590 --> 27:33.510
I'm glad.

27:33.650 --> 27:36.680
I couldn't sleep last night.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.690
I fell asleep at dawn.

27:40.570 --> 27:41.600
Yes.

27:41.640 --> 27:43.570
I missed my prayer.

27:48.590 --> 27:49.650
Where?

27:52.540 --> 27:53.610
Why?

27:56.700 --> 28:01.500
I wanted to go shopping
with the girls.

28:02.640 --> 28:05.700
Rezvan needs
some clothes for college

28:06.500 --> 28:08.730
and Sana some stationery.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.520
Then, we're not going.

28:14.550 --> 28:17.530
If you say it's risky,
we'll stay home.

28:20.590 --> 28:22.610
Don't worry.

28:24.510 --> 28:25.640
OK, my love.

28:26.550 --> 28:28.600
Sure, bye.

28:31.510 --> 28:35.530
If they have stationery
from previous years,

28:35.570 --> 28:36.700
they shouldn't buy more.

28:37.500 --> 28:39.620
They'd better avoid wasting.

28:40.580 --> 28:42.580
Two days before school starts,

28:42.620 --> 28:46.530
parents flock
to school supplies shops

28:46.570 --> 28:48.510
for their children.

28:48.550 --> 28:50.690
Maryam Jafari for National TV

28:50.730 --> 28:52.560
at Tehran's bazar.

28:52.600 --> 28:53.640
Last night,

28:53.680 --> 28:54.650
several neighborhoods

28:54.690 --> 28:56.690
were the scene of protests

28:56.730 --> 28:59.640
turned into riots by some individuals

29:00.500 --> 29:03.550
who disturbed the peace
for a few hours.

29:03.590 --> 29:05.520
Last night's incidents

29:05.620 --> 29:08.550
caused widespread damage
to public property

29:08.590 --> 29:11.610
as well as businesses.

29:15.580 --> 29:16.730
The protests that took place

29:17.530 --> 29:20.500
in some places in Tehran

29:20.540 --> 29:21.680
quickly degenerated.

29:21.720 --> 29:26.640
The rioters damaged
public and private property.

29:27.700 --> 29:30.500
It's 8:55 pm

29:30.540 --> 29:31.650
on Ghods square,

29:31.690 --> 29:34.680
in front of the City Hall,
a car is burning...

30:14.580 --> 30:16.690
They're getting beaten up!
And those lies on TV!

30:32.690 --> 30:35.560
Has Sadaf arrived at her dorm?

30:37.580 --> 30:39.680
Haven't heard from her yet.

31:56.690 --> 31:58.630
Who do you think
you are?

31:59.560 --> 32:02.500
You're coming on my land
to beat me?

32:26.640 --> 32:28.730
Down with the dictator!

32:33.600 --> 32:35.620
Down with the dictator!

32:37.550 --> 32:39.710
Sadaf, are they shouting slogans
there too?

32:40.510 --> 32:41.530
Yes.

32:41.720 --> 32:45.510
- The neighbors!
- Let me see!

32:45.550 --> 32:46.560
In the dorm?

32:46.600 --> 32:48.700
Can't you hear? Listen.

32:49.570 --> 32:51.510
Down with theocracy!

32:51.550 --> 32:52.720
Did you shout too?

32:53.520 --> 32:54.730
Yes and I took off my veil!

32:55.530 --> 32:57.610
- Really?
- Awesome!

32:57.650 --> 32:58.730
Down with the dictator!

33:00.640 --> 33:02.670
You're crazy! What are you doing?

33:02.710 --> 33:05.620
I sent you videos. Check them out.

33:06.550 --> 33:08.730
It's all filtered,
I can't see anything.

33:09.530 --> 33:10.720
I'll send you a VPN.

33:11.520 --> 33:12.610
To me too!

33:12.650 --> 33:14.510
Shut up!

33:14.550 --> 33:15.710
You don't have to imitate me!

33:16.510 --> 33:17.570
I wanna go on the net.

33:17.610 --> 33:19.510
Send it, bye.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.610
Little pest.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.580
In the name of Mahsa Amini,
some fringe groups

33:29.620 --> 33:32.650
called for rallies
that turned into riots.

33:34.540 --> 33:37.620
We could have gone out for a pizza.

33:37.690 --> 33:41.600
Staying one day at home
is more than you can take?

33:41.640 --> 33:43.510
Don't you see this chaos?

33:43.550 --> 33:45.730
What chaos?
People are living their lives.

33:46.530 --> 33:49.550
You two think you know better
than your parents?

33:49.590 --> 33:52.580
Setting fires and breaking glass
is living one's life?

33:52.620 --> 33:55.700
They're not letting them protest.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.700
Go ahead,
defend the rioters in court.

33:59.500 --> 34:00.660
It's impossible to talk to you.

34:00.700 --> 34:03.540
Quiet, I'm listening to the news.

34:04.520 --> 34:08.550
Speculation about the cause of death
is circulating in the media,

34:08.590 --> 34:09.710
from different sources.

34:10.510 --> 34:12.650
She died as a result
of police violence.

34:12.690 --> 34:15.650
Traces of blows were observed.

34:16.520 --> 34:17.710
Traces of blows.

34:18.510 --> 34:19.540
The security police

34:19.580 --> 34:21.550
have released CCTV footage.

34:21.590 --> 34:23.560
Here are the first images

34:23.600 --> 34:25.600
to be released by the police.

34:25.680 --> 34:30.530
From Uzbekistan, the President
ordered an emergency procedure.

34:30.570 --> 34:33.620
The Minister of the Interior
has asked

34:33.660 --> 34:35.510
his Security Officer

34:35.550 --> 34:37.640
to quickly
and accurately determine

34:37.680 --> 34:40.500
the causes of the incident
and report back.

34:40.620 --> 34:42.700
On social media, some maintain

34:43.500 --> 34:44.640
that Mahsa Amini died

34:44.680 --> 34:46.620
as a result of police brutality.

34:46.660 --> 34:48.590
She has visible injuries.

34:48.630 --> 34:50.600
Widespread calls for rallies

34:50.640 --> 34:52.640
were published on social media.

34:52.680 --> 34:54.510
Among them...

34:54.550 --> 34:56.670
Was she really killed for her hijab?

34:57.670 --> 34:59.610
Not at all, she was sick.

34:59.650 --> 35:01.550
She had a stroke.

35:01.690 --> 35:03.520
How do you know?

35:03.560 --> 35:04.660
It's what TV said.

35:04.700 --> 35:06.720
The TV is always right?

35:07.520 --> 35:09.590
No, you're always right.

35:09.630 --> 35:13.580
She had heart issues
and had a stroke at the station.

35:13.620 --> 35:17.540
She must have been so scared
that she had a stroke.

35:17.580 --> 35:20.580
People have strokes every day.
Is it the regime's fault?

35:20.620 --> 35:23.540
They don't all die
from fear of the police!

35:23.580 --> 35:24.690
What if it was your daughter?

35:24.730 --> 35:27.720
My daughter had better not be seen
in an outfit like that!

35:28.520 --> 35:30.640
Why should people get arrested
for their outfit?

35:30.680 --> 35:33.610
That's God's order,
the law of the country.

35:33.650 --> 35:35.730
What if the law of the country
is wrong?

35:36.530 --> 35:37.650
God's law cannot be wrong.

35:37.690 --> 35:40.510
What makes you so sure
this is God's law?

35:40.550 --> 35:41.650
What's the matter with you?

35:41.690 --> 35:43.690
Go out and shout slogans!

35:43.730 --> 35:46.650
Go dance on the streets bareheaded!

35:47.550 --> 35:49.550
If your father knew
what's going on here!

35:49.590 --> 35:50.680
Move it!

35:54.510 --> 35:56.540
What's the matter with her?

35:56.580 --> 35:57.670
What do I know?

36:22.660 --> 36:24.660
The girls have grown.

36:25.540 --> 36:27.530
They have opinions, questions.

36:27.570 --> 36:28.730
They need you.

36:30.500 --> 36:31.730
I'm not asking for anything.

36:32.530 --> 36:35.570
But at this age,
a girl needs her father.

36:35.630 --> 36:37.610
They're getting bored.

36:38.690 --> 36:40.650
If I bug them too much,

36:40.690 --> 36:43.620
they dig their heels in
and don't listen to me.

36:46.670 --> 36:48.560
It's gonna be all right.

36:48.720 --> 36:50.690
It's a phase.

36:52.610 --> 36:55.530
The school and the college
are opening soon.

36:56.590 --> 36:58.660
That will keep them busy.

37:00.540 --> 37:01.700
Be patient.

37:04.500 --> 37:05.520
Iman...

37:08.520 --> 37:11.510
Did you sign the death indictment?

37:11.690 --> 37:13.560
Did I have the choice?

37:18.650 --> 37:21.690
"I submit to the one
who submits to You.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.680
"I fight him who fights You.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.540
Until the Last Day."

37:42.670 --> 37:43.680
Iman...

37:46.700 --> 37:49.530
I know you want to sleep.

37:49.610 --> 37:54.570
But you remember you promised
you'd buy a dishwasher?

37:56.600 --> 37:59.600
My hands and the girls'
are getting damaged.

38:00.700 --> 38:03.500
Next week.

38:29.730 --> 38:32.660
Remember not to take
your phone out of your bag.

38:32.700 --> 38:34.650
I won't, Mom.

38:40.680 --> 38:42.620
I'll pick you up at 1.

38:42.660 --> 38:44.570
Bye.

39:01.620 --> 39:02.730
Rezvan honey,

39:03.530 --> 39:06.540
weren't you supposed
to distance yourself from her?

39:06.580 --> 39:08.610
Sadaf is my only friend.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.550
There's nothing wrong with that.

39:10.590 --> 39:13.500
But be careful because of Dad's job.

39:13.540 --> 39:16.640
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.550
What does Dad do?

39:18.590 --> 39:20.720
A sensitive job, like my brother's.

39:21.610 --> 39:24.700
He's travelling all the time
and nobody knows where he is.

39:25.500 --> 39:27.560
Do you know what he does?

39:27.600 --> 39:30.610
I'm his sister and all I know
is that he's a military man.

39:30.650 --> 39:34.550
But Dad, is he a judge,
an investigator, a military man?

39:34.620 --> 39:37.510
I'm telling you
he has a sensitive job.

39:38.500 --> 39:39.580
We have to be discreet.

39:39.620 --> 39:41.660
When you get close to people,

39:41.700 --> 39:43.730
you must always be careful
to avoid leaks.

39:44.620 --> 39:48.630
What were you thinking
offering to pick up Sadaf?

39:48.670 --> 39:50.690
Her dorm is on our way.

39:50.730 --> 39:53.520
You don't want her in our home.

39:53.560 --> 39:56.630
I'm 21 and you're controlling
all my relationships.

39:56.670 --> 40:00.570
I'm not controlling,
I'm watching over my family.

40:00.650 --> 40:02.680
You'll understand
when you're a mother.

40:05.720 --> 40:07.660
Sadaf is here.

40:15.610 --> 40:17.720
- Hello!
- Hi, how are you?

40:18.520 --> 40:20.510
You're OK? Your parents too?

40:20.550 --> 40:21.560
Yes, thank you.

40:21.600 --> 40:24.620
I just talked to my mom.
She says hi.

40:24.660 --> 40:26.570
That's nice of her.

40:28.610 --> 40:31.570
Last night, it was crazy at the dorm.

40:31.610 --> 40:32.640
Why?

40:32.680 --> 40:35.550
They were all out chanting slogans.

40:35.590 --> 40:36.630
You too?

40:36.670 --> 40:39.550
Did your mom say
how it was in their city?

40:39.590 --> 40:42.510
Yeah, people are very angry
everywhere.

40:42.660 --> 40:44.690
They're not people
but a bunch of thugs.

40:44.730 --> 40:47.700
Be careful not to mingle with them.

41:09.630 --> 41:11.500
- Hello?
- Mom...

41:11.540 --> 41:12.550
What's going on?

41:12.590 --> 41:14.700
Come pick me up. The school's closed.

41:15.500 --> 41:16.590
Why?

41:16.630 --> 41:18.590
The girls are demonstrating.

41:18.630 --> 41:19.670
At the school?

41:19.710 --> 41:21.730
Yes, it's quite tense.

41:22.530 --> 41:24.510
I'll turn around, I'm coming.

41:24.550 --> 41:27.600
- Keep your distance, I'm coming.
- OK.

41:39.620 --> 41:41.720
We are receiving messages

41:42.570 --> 41:45.670
that the principals
are no longer noting absences.

41:46.640 --> 41:48.660
We can officially skip school!

41:48.700 --> 41:52.660
Before, we felt bad doing it.

41:52.700 --> 41:55.600
Now, it's official.

41:55.650 --> 41:59.710
Don't bother coming,
they won't let you in the door.

42:00.590 --> 42:02.630
Basically, in the colleges
and in the highschools,

42:02.670 --> 42:04.700
it's a free-for-all.

42:09.730 --> 42:10.730
Bye.

42:13.660 --> 42:15.540
Hi.

42:15.650 --> 42:16.710
What's going on?

42:17.510 --> 42:19.560
They were shouting slogans.

42:19.600 --> 42:20.620
What slogans?

42:20.660 --> 42:22.570
Women, life, freedom.

42:24.510 --> 42:26.650
I can't reach Rezvan.

42:26.690 --> 42:28.500
Let me try.

42:28.630 --> 42:30.680
Maybe she's out of battery.

42:32.550 --> 42:35.680
I think they cut the coverage
during the demonstrations.

42:36.690 --> 42:38.510
Let's go pick her up.

42:38.550 --> 42:39.730
Can't reach her.

42:47.570 --> 42:48.610
What's he saying?

42:49.520 --> 42:51.720
He says not this way, the other way.

42:52.700 --> 42:55.540
But I can't go from there...

43:32.540 --> 43:33.600
Rezvan...

43:33.690 --> 43:35.530
Rezvan!

43:54.720 --> 43:55.720
Iman...

43:56.580 --> 43:58.690
What's new? Since what time?

43:59.590 --> 44:03.560
No one knows
what time the college closed?

44:04.620 --> 44:07.550
In that case,
she should be home by now!

44:07.660 --> 44:10.510
How will I find my girl?

44:11.680 --> 44:15.610
OK, I'll wait to hear from you.

44:15.670 --> 44:18.600
Iman, call me, don't forget.

44:21.670 --> 44:22.660
Hello?

44:23.500 --> 44:24.610
Rezvan, where are you?

44:24.670 --> 44:26.560
We're at home.

44:26.660 --> 44:28.640
Don't come, Mom's here.

44:29.620 --> 44:30.650
How is she?

44:31.650 --> 44:32.670
Poor thing.

44:34.660 --> 44:37.520
No, I've got this.

44:37.660 --> 44:39.710
Stay close, I'll call you.

44:40.550 --> 44:41.620
See you in a minute.

44:52.590 --> 44:53.590
Mom...

44:55.550 --> 44:58.620
I'm out of sanitary pads.

45:00.530 --> 45:01.710
You got scared, honey?

45:02.620 --> 45:04.540
I'll give you some of mine.

45:04.580 --> 45:06.550
Sorry, but I need thin ones.

45:06.590 --> 45:09.520
If you can't go, I'll buy some.

45:09.640 --> 45:11.590
You've got a nerve!

45:11.630 --> 45:13.510
You want to go out?

45:13.660 --> 45:16.590
Certainly not, I'll go.

45:16.630 --> 45:18.530
Thanks a lot.

45:32.640 --> 45:33.660
Hello?

45:34.510 --> 45:35.700
She's leaving the building now.

45:36.500 --> 45:37.620
I'm coming down.

46:30.500 --> 46:31.650
Go get painkillers.

46:55.690 --> 46:56.670
Sadaf...

46:59.580 --> 47:00.650
Take this.

47:00.690 --> 47:03.520
Drink some water, sweetie.

47:03.560 --> 47:05.590
It's OK, my love.

47:05.630 --> 47:08.520
You'll get better.

47:09.710 --> 47:11.700
Lean back.

47:16.580 --> 47:17.610
Rezvan...

47:21.610 --> 47:24.510
- What?
- Her face...

47:24.610 --> 47:25.700
What should we do?

47:26.500 --> 47:27.670
I have no idea.

47:27.710 --> 47:29.640
Shouldn't we take her to a hospital?

47:29.680 --> 47:32.710
- She says she'd be arrested.
- So what?

47:33.640 --> 47:35.540
What if something happens?

47:35.580 --> 47:39.530
If they arrest her, they won't
let her stay in the hospital.

47:39.570 --> 47:40.720
They'd hurt her.

47:41.520 --> 47:44.530
We have to find a safe doctor.

47:44.570 --> 47:45.690
But how?

47:47.500 --> 47:48.570
Mom...

47:48.610 --> 47:49.680
Rezvan!

47:51.560 --> 47:52.630
You're here?

47:53.530 --> 47:56.500
Why didn't you call me?
I was worried sick.

48:01.690 --> 48:03.510
What's going on?

52:16.610 --> 52:18.620
There's nothing more I can do.

52:19.670 --> 52:23.510
If something happens to her,
who will answer to her family?

52:23.720 --> 52:26.590
She doesn't want her family to know.

52:26.630 --> 52:28.520
It's none of our business.

52:28.660 --> 52:30.510
It's my business.

52:30.630 --> 52:32.650
Why doesn't she want them to know?

52:32.720 --> 52:34.590
I don't know.

52:34.660 --> 52:38.520
All I know is she's in danger
and we need to help her.

52:39.540 --> 52:42.580
I can't allow you to.
It's too much responsibility.

52:42.690 --> 52:43.680
Mom!

52:43.720 --> 52:45.620
You saw her face.

52:45.660 --> 52:47.530
Is it my fault?

52:47.570 --> 52:49.520
She shouldn't have gone.

52:49.560 --> 52:50.630
Gone where?

52:50.670 --> 52:53.530
It was at college,
we got caught in the crowd.

52:53.570 --> 52:55.730
I don't want this in this home.

52:56.530 --> 52:58.500
Have you thought of your father?

52:58.540 --> 53:00.520
You're responsible for him too.

53:00.560 --> 53:02.670
Sadaf, what are you doing?

53:02.710 --> 53:03.730
Sadaf!

53:05.550 --> 53:06.550
I want to go.

53:06.590 --> 53:07.710
You're not well.

53:08.650 --> 53:11.610
You have to call your mom.

53:11.650 --> 53:13.630
- OK.
- I'll take you.

53:13.670 --> 53:15.580
- Mom!
- Don't bother.

53:15.620 --> 53:17.640
Tell her I don't want her to take me.

53:17.680 --> 53:19.650
Stay, we'll take you to a doctor.

53:19.690 --> 53:21.600
Let me talk to her.

53:21.640 --> 53:23.550
I'll call her a taxi.

53:23.590 --> 53:24.610
Put her veil on.

53:24.650 --> 53:26.520
Mom, let her stay, please.

53:26.560 --> 53:28.710
The neighbors mustn't see her face.

53:31.580 --> 53:32.680
Sorry, my love.

53:36.620 --> 53:38.500
- I'll call you.
- OK.

53:38.540 --> 53:39.620
Let's go.

55:24.670 --> 55:26.590
By changing jobs,

55:27.560 --> 55:29.570
you have also changed?

55:32.650 --> 55:35.510
Why don't you answer my calls?

55:36.680 --> 55:38.550
I was in a meeting.

55:41.540 --> 55:42.680
And after the meeting?

55:44.500 --> 55:45.720
I called several times.

55:48.620 --> 55:49.650
Lots of times.

55:56.600 --> 55:57.660
Let me in.

57:31.520 --> 57:32.540
Today,

57:35.650 --> 57:38.530
I had a complicated case.

57:39.560 --> 57:41.510
It preoccupied me.

57:43.550 --> 57:47.600
Complicated enough
to make you forget about your family?

57:49.690 --> 57:51.680
A twenty-year-old boy.

57:56.650 --> 57:58.610
No matter how strong you are,

57:59.590 --> 58:01.660
how unfailing your faith is,

58:02.670 --> 58:05.560
death sentences are overwhelming.

58:07.600 --> 58:08.680
Out of bad luck,

58:09.630 --> 58:11.630
the protests coincided

58:11.670 --> 58:13.640
with my arrival at this position.

58:15.500 --> 58:17.580
There are countless arrests.

58:19.510 --> 58:21.710
From 14-year-olds
to 70-year-old men and women.

58:24.590 --> 58:26.630
More of them every day.

58:28.590 --> 58:30.630
Police stations are saturated.

58:30.670 --> 58:33.660
We're asked to rush through them.

58:34.710 --> 58:38.680
I have a few minutes
to make a decision.

58:40.610 --> 58:43.690
100, 200, 300 cases a day.

58:44.660 --> 58:45.630
What can I do?

58:48.660 --> 58:50.590
Work is work.

58:51.510 --> 58:54.700
Do you know how long it's been
since you had a meal with the girls?

58:55.500 --> 58:57.620
Explain, reassure them.

58:58.700 --> 59:00.630
Who reassures me?

59:03.620 --> 59:06.720
Tomorrow morning, before leaving,
take the time to talk to them.

59:07.520 --> 59:08.660
I can't.

59:09.640 --> 59:12.500
I have to be in court very early.

59:12.720 --> 59:15.620
I promise to be back for dinner.

59:16.730 --> 59:18.520
Mom...

59:19.540 --> 59:20.710
Hi, Dad.

59:21.590 --> 59:22.650
Can you come?

59:22.690 --> 59:24.700
Go, darling, I'm coming.

59:25.550 --> 59:26.590
What is it?

59:26.630 --> 59:28.680
They must have argued.

59:29.680 --> 59:31.660
It looks great on you.

59:32.590 --> 59:33.690
I'll be back.

59:39.520 --> 59:41.720
Look what they're doing to her,
poor thing.

59:43.520 --> 59:44.640
It's at the dorm?

59:44.710 --> 59:47.570
Her friends filmed them secretly.

59:48.600 --> 59:50.660
I told you she should have stayed.

59:51.570 --> 59:52.710
On the contrary,

59:53.510 --> 59:54.570
I was right.

59:54.610 --> 59:57.590
They would come for her here.
What about your father?

59:57.630 --> 59:58.620
I'll talk to him.

59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.640
Stay here. What are you doing?

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.710
- I'll talk to him.
- About what?

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:07.510
I want to know where she is.
Nobody knows who took her.

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:08.690
Sadaf did nothing.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:10.620
You father doesn't know about that.

01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:11.670
Who does, then?

01:00:12.620 --> 01:00:14.710
None of your business, you brat.

01:00:15.570 --> 01:00:17.680
- Mom...
- You two listen to me.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:21.540
The agents have her phone.
Do not call or text her.

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:23.540
Same goes for you, Sana.

01:00:23.650 --> 01:00:26.720
She must have done something
to get arrested this way.

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.590
Mom, listen.

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:31.580
Sadaf did nothing.

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:33.620
I was with her.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.660
I beg you, help her.

01:00:38.550 --> 01:00:41.530
Never say again
that you were with her.

01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:44.510
You were nowhere with her, got it?

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.670
I know someone who can help us.

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:49.640
I'll find her by tomorrow morning.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.730
Now go to bed, phones off.
Go!

01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:39.610
What did he say?

01:01:39.650 --> 01:01:41.570
He got hit by buckshot.

01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:49.690
Gosh! They're breaking in.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.580
Oh no...

01:02:55.690 --> 01:02:56.680
God.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.690
They've pulled
her jacket over her head.

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:00.690
They've covered her head.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.500
They're taking the kid...

01:04:14.510 --> 01:04:15.550
Hello.

01:04:15.590 --> 01:04:17.550
- How are you?
- Thanks.

01:04:17.590 --> 01:04:19.580
How are the kids?

01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.720
Fine, thank you.
How's Alireza?

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:23.580
Good, thanks.

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:27.690
He said Iman has become
an investigator, congratulations.

01:04:28.530 --> 01:04:31.560
For now, it's mostly problems.

01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.680
He's swamped.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:34.720
Don't be ungrateful.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:38.690
He'll have a big pay raise,
you'll be given official housing.

01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:41.520
After a couple of years
in this position,

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:44.580
he'll be promoted
to the revolutionary court.

01:04:44.670 --> 01:04:48.500
Then, you'll be all set.

01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:50.580
Being a judge's wife is the best.

01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.500
I wish the same for you.

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:54.640
We're not so lucky.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:58.550
Alireza too should have be promoted
to an investigator, but...

01:04:58.590 --> 01:04:59.610
it didn't happen.

01:04:59.650 --> 01:05:00.710
It's God's will.

01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:03.650
For now, they're arresting
so many people.

01:05:03.690 --> 01:05:07.550
Night and day, it never stops.

01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:11.630
I know. Actually, I'm here
for a friend's daughter.

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:14.540
She got arrested
and her family hasn't heard from her.

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:15.600
When did it happen?

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.510
Last night, at her dorm.

01:05:18.630 --> 01:05:21.520
Who arrested her?
Plainclothes cops?

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.530
Or special forces?

01:05:23.570 --> 01:05:25.510
Plainclothes, I think.

01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:29.510
Then it will take a while
before they know anything.

01:05:29.730 --> 01:05:32.710
I've come to ask you
to do a good deed.

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:37.610
If you could search her name
in your base.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.500
No promises, but send me her name

01:05:40.540 --> 01:05:43.530
and also her identification number.

01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:44.630
Sure.

01:05:44.670 --> 01:05:47.510
I have to go. You see it's endless.

01:05:47.550 --> 01:05:49.660
Thank you for taking the time.

01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:51.650
No problem.

01:05:51.690 --> 01:05:53.690
I don't want to interfere,

01:05:53.730 --> 01:05:56.610
but these friends of yours
who ask you a favor

01:05:56.650 --> 01:05:59.510
let their children
take part in riots.

01:05:59.550 --> 01:06:01.710
- And then...
- Yes, I know.

01:06:02.510 --> 01:06:06.560
These days, some unscrupulous people

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:09.670
have posted the addresses
and phone numbers

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:12.530
of judges, investigators,

01:06:12.570 --> 01:06:14.660
or whoever works for the government.

01:06:14.700 --> 01:06:17.630
They have found them
and put them on social media.

01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:19.550
No, seriously?

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:23.620
Imagine, when they circulate
on the hostile media...

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:26.610
You need to choose
your acquaintances wisely.

01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:28.630
We will, for sure.

01:06:29.500 --> 01:06:30.670
Say hi to your family.

01:06:30.710 --> 01:06:32.600
Thank you, Fatemeh.

01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:37.540
Please, don't tell Alireza
about my request.

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:40.530
If he tells Iman,
he wouldn't like it.

01:06:40.570 --> 01:06:42.730
Don't even say you saw me,
it's between us.

01:06:43.530 --> 01:06:44.610
OK, no worries.

01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:46.620
Take care. See you soon.

01:06:46.660 --> 01:06:48.580
- See you.
- Bye.

01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:05.660
Hi, Mom.

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:07.690
- What's new?
- Take these.

01:07:09.630 --> 01:07:11.630
We need her identification number.

01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:13.690
How are we gonna find that?

01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:15.530
No idea.

01:07:15.570 --> 01:07:17.710
You're talking like it's my fault.

01:07:18.510 --> 01:07:22.590
She must have broken windows
or burnt tires.

01:07:22.710 --> 01:07:24.730
That will teach her a lesson.

01:07:25.530 --> 01:07:26.690
Call her family.

01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:28.730
I told you she didn't do anything.

01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:30.590
They were together.

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:32.620
Rezvan could have been
shot in the eye too.

01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:35.560
What were you doing
with those rioters?

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.640
These loose women
in the streets, undressed.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.660
Hello?

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.560
Hi, any news?

01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:46.590
She needs the identification number.
Can you find it?

01:07:47.660 --> 01:07:49.690
OK, try to find it
as soon as possible.

01:07:49.730 --> 01:07:51.630
I'll wait for your call.

01:07:51.670 --> 01:07:53.580
What the hell are you doing?

01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:55.640
Who were you talking to?

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:57.650
What's wrong with you?
To a classmate.

01:07:57.690 --> 01:08:01.520
Did you tell anyone we can help her?
Did you mention your father?

01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:02.620
In what way?

01:08:02.660 --> 01:08:04.560
Stop playing dumb.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:07.620
How do your friends think
you're searching for her?

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:09.500
I didn't mention Dad.

01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:12.530
- How then?
- I said my uncle knows someone.

01:08:12.570 --> 01:08:14.650
How dare you mention your uncle?

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.580
If I ever hear you mention

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.540
your father or your uncle...

01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:20.530
I didn't say anything, Mom!

01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:21.720
I know what I can and can't say!

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:25.630
Stop threatening me
or I'm moving out!

01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:27.540
Moving out, congrats!

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:31.530
What do you think this is? A hotel?
You're shameless!

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:34.600
- Don't close the door!
- Leave her alone!

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:56.520
Not like this, set it down.

01:08:56.710 --> 01:09:00.610
Take another one.
Move these aside, my hands are dirty.

01:09:01.650 --> 01:09:04.640
- How should I cut it?
- In slices, the other way round.

01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:07.720
Put it here.
The other way round.

01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:09.670
Now cut it in slices.

01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:12.640
Set it down.

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:15.500
- It's OK.
- You'll get burnt.

01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:26.620
Turn them with this.

01:10:48.550 --> 01:10:50.600
Down with theocracy!

01:11:29.610 --> 01:11:31.680
Down with theocracy!

01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:36.590
Each person killed

01:11:36.630 --> 01:11:39.580
Is replaced by a thousand more

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.520
What's going on?

01:11:45.530 --> 01:11:47.650
You're here?
I thought you forgot.

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.720
I rushed out of court.

01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:51.680
My phone was off.

01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.720
They're shouting in our building too.

01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.500
The bastards.

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:00.700
We'll get rid of them.

01:12:01.700 --> 01:12:03.730
They take advantage of the system

01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:05.670
and they insult it.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.540
There are more of them every night.

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:26.590
What if something happened?

01:12:28.670 --> 01:12:29.700
Like what?

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:32.650
Don't you think of it?

01:12:33.710 --> 01:12:36.690
If something happens,
what would they do to us?

01:12:41.510 --> 01:12:42.670
Nothing will happen.

01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:44.710
How can you be so sure?

01:12:45.510 --> 01:12:46.620
We'll stop them.

01:12:46.660 --> 01:12:49.710
Whoever confronts God
does it at their own risk.

01:12:51.630 --> 01:12:55.680
There's agitation everywhere,
in colleges, schools.

01:12:56.510 --> 01:12:57.610
Let them agitate.

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.560
Even schoolgirls

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.730
are in the streets bareheaded
chanting slogans.

01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:06.590
Where are the girls?

01:13:06.630 --> 01:13:08.650
In their bedroom.
They're upset.

01:13:08.690 --> 01:13:11.580
Some of Rezvan's friends
have been arrested.

01:13:12.690 --> 01:13:15.500
Rezvan wasn't in the commotion,
was she?

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.600
No, she wasn't.

01:13:18.590 --> 01:13:21.510
But one of her close friends
was arrested.

01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:23.620
She's very worried about her.

01:13:23.730 --> 01:13:26.510
Why does she have
that kind of friend?

01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:30.640
I can't make their friends
undergo a merit test.

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:34.710
They met at college and became close.

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:39.660
Poor kid came to Tehran for college
and ends up in jail.

01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.620
But she hasn't done anything.

01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:46.580
All the families say
the indictees did nothing.

01:13:46.650 --> 01:13:50.610
I'm telling you,
she really did nothing.

01:13:51.570 --> 01:13:53.700
She found herself
in the middle of the rally.

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:55.540
There we go.

01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:57.690
Being in a rally
is a five-year sentence.

01:13:59.650 --> 01:14:01.510
OK, fine.

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.680
All I want to know
is if you can find

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.500
her whereabouts for her family.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.600
How?

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:10.610
God knows where she is.

01:14:10.690 --> 01:14:12.560
They'll have to wait.

01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:14.710
- They're so many of them.
- How long?

01:14:15.510 --> 01:14:16.620
Until she talks.

01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.560
She'll be kept
in solitary confinement

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.580
until she confesses
in front of a camera.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.690
Confess? She's done nothing.

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.600
How do you know she's done nothing?

01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:34.730
Anyway.

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:38.670
Can you try to find out how she is?

01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:39.680
Just that.

01:14:40.540 --> 01:14:42.690
No. Even if I wanted to, I couldn't.

01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:45.730
At this stage, it's out of my hands.

01:15:01.510 --> 01:15:03.670
Nothing but lies. Turn it off.

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:08.720
What'd you say, honey?

01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.730
Nothing.

01:15:14.540 --> 01:15:15.670
You said something.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:20.510
I said we should turn off the TV
during dinner.

01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:21.620
Before.

01:15:31.650 --> 01:15:33.500
I said it was nothing but lies.

01:15:33.620 --> 01:15:35.580
Sweet Lord.

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:43.560
How do you know?

01:15:44.530 --> 01:15:45.720
I live in this country.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.730
I've got eyes.

01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:52.650
Are you sure? It could be the enemy
that's persuading you.

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.590
What enemy, Dad?

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:57.660
My friends were beaten and arrested
before my eyes.

01:15:58.630 --> 01:15:59.670
Listen,

01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:03.560
I know there's room for improvement.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:07.570
But you guys don't realize
that the whole world is against us.

01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:08.730
This is all an enemy plot.

01:16:09.610 --> 01:16:11.530
What plot?

01:16:11.570 --> 01:16:14.550
I don't care about the enemy
or some conspiracy theory.

01:16:14.590 --> 01:16:17.550
A girl my age
was killed because of her hijab.

01:16:17.590 --> 01:16:18.570
Why?

01:16:18.700 --> 01:16:21.530
See, your facts aren't straight.

01:16:22.530 --> 01:16:23.610
She had a stroke.

01:16:24.650 --> 01:16:27.630
But through the media,
the enemy brainwashed you

01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:29.590
into believing she was killed.

01:16:29.630 --> 01:16:32.550
So why do they refuse to investigate?

01:16:32.590 --> 01:16:35.660
Why don't they let an independent
commission take action?

01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:38.660
They're killing all these people
simply to deny killing her?

01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:40.580
You're going too far.

01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:45.660
Me and thousands of others,

01:16:45.700 --> 01:16:49.580
are slaving away
to preserve this country for whom?

01:16:49.620 --> 01:16:50.660
For you!

01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:52.570
You are defending

01:16:52.610 --> 01:16:55.640
a bunch of sluts who just want
to walk the street naked!

01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.550
Who wants to walk naked?

01:16:57.590 --> 01:16:58.690
The people in the streets!

01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:00.600
Who, Dad?

01:17:01.570 --> 01:17:04.510
I happened to be
in the crowd yesterday.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:06.550
You had no right to!

01:17:06.590 --> 01:17:07.670
It was a coincidence.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.560
I was leaving the college
with my friend.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.520
They shot her in the face
with buckshot.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:15.600
And then they arrested her
at her dorm.

01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:18.650
Even if she lives,
she'll lose an eye.

01:17:18.690 --> 01:17:22.500
Her beauty is gone,
her bright future too.

01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:23.630
Why?

01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:25.660
Listen, every day,

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:29.500
I interrogate
thousands of people like her.

01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:32.500
- I know who they're involved with.
- Who?

01:17:32.590 --> 01:17:36.500
They're just normal people
who want a normal life and freedom.

01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:37.580
Just like anywhere else.

01:17:37.620 --> 01:17:39.570
Good God.

01:17:39.610 --> 01:17:41.690
Stop arguing with your father!

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.610
If not as a father,

01:17:44.650 --> 01:17:47.550
as an expert who's been serving
this regime for 20 years,

01:17:47.590 --> 01:17:48.720
don't you think I know better?

01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:50.560
No.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.650
You don't, Dad.

01:17:57.670 --> 01:17:59.600
Because you're on the inside.

01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:00.680
You believe in it.

01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:04.680
You want to preserve it at all cost.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:15.570
Iman...

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:20.700
For once we were having
a family dinner, you ruined it.

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:50.600
Iman...

01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:53.630
Iman.

01:19:07.730 --> 01:19:09.590
Here, have some water.

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:34.590
You OK?

01:20:45.730 --> 01:20:47.560
Najmeh...

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.510
Najmeh dear.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:51.590
Yes?

01:20:51.630 --> 01:20:53.580
Where have you put my gun?

01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.520
Your gun?

01:20:58.610 --> 01:21:00.500
I don't know.

01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:02.540
I didn't touch it.

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.710
My God...

01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:07.540
Are you sure you had it
when you came home?

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:19.670
- I came in, you were at the window.
- Yes.

01:22:20.510 --> 01:22:23.500
I took off my jacket,
threw it on the bed.

01:22:23.610 --> 01:22:25.500
I put the gun...

01:22:25.690 --> 01:22:27.660
in the drawer and then...

01:22:28.510 --> 01:22:29.600
I sat down here.

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:32.680
I didn't mention it,
but the other evening,

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.710
you left it in the bathroom.

01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:37.550
I found it there
when I picked up the laundry.

01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:40.520
I put it away in this drawer.

01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:56.680
You'll find it.

01:23:10.690 --> 01:23:12.500
The kids!

01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:14.540
Where are you going?

01:23:14.660 --> 01:23:16.550
They may have taken it.

01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:18.670
Take your gun?

01:23:19.550 --> 01:23:20.580
Can you ask them?

01:23:20.620 --> 01:23:23.570
You want me to wake them up
to ask them about your gun?

01:23:23.610 --> 01:23:24.680
Yes, I do!

01:23:59.570 --> 01:24:00.630
Rezvan...

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.710
Sweetheart...

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.640
Wake up, please.

01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:09.560
What's going on?

01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:11.600
Your Dad's gun is not in its place.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.530
Do you know where it is?

01:24:13.570 --> 01:24:14.600
What?

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:17.550
A gun?

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:20.520
Dad has a gun?

01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:22.600
No, nothing.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.660
Go back to sleep.

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:37.600
- So?
- I told you, it scared her.

01:24:37.640 --> 01:24:40.550
They didn't even know you have a gun.

01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:43.580
God...

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:49.690
Iman...

01:24:50.660 --> 01:24:54.510
Maybe you've left it in court.

01:24:54.550 --> 01:24:56.520
Go check.

01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:09.510
Six months to three years in jail.

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:13.720
Worse than the sentence,

01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:18.570
is the discredit.

01:25:21.690 --> 01:25:24.630
You've been here
less than two weeks.

01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:30.530
Such an embarrassment.

01:25:30.570 --> 01:25:32.500
There'd be talk.

01:25:36.700 --> 01:25:38.610
They'll say you were incapable

01:25:38.650 --> 01:25:41.540
of keeping your gun for a few days.

01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:45.610
Your merits will be questioned.

01:25:47.650 --> 01:25:49.610
They'll lose faith in you.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.610
Prevent you from moving up.

01:25:55.510 --> 01:25:56.590
I'll find it.

01:25:56.630 --> 01:25:58.570
You have to find it.

01:26:00.630 --> 01:26:02.530
For now, don't report it,

01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:04.590
don't say anything to anyone.

01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:07.710
Based on what you're saying,

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.700
it's in your house, without a doubt.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.660
Maybe if you just wait a few days,

01:26:14.570 --> 01:26:17.530
the one who's taken it
will put it back.

01:26:26.550 --> 01:26:28.510
Don't repeat yourself.

01:26:28.650 --> 01:26:30.570
Where would I have left it?

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.550
Najmeh, think back
to what she said last night,

01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:34.710
it just has to be at home.

01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:36.560
Yes.

01:26:37.620 --> 01:26:40.540
Keep me up to date.

01:26:43.510 --> 01:26:45.620
Put them properly on the desk.

01:26:52.530 --> 01:26:54.620
- And the top one?
- It's empty!

01:27:03.670 --> 01:27:05.640
These are my underwear!

01:28:14.650 --> 01:28:16.560
In my own home,

01:28:18.690 --> 01:28:20.650
I don't feel safe.

01:28:22.670 --> 01:28:24.650
Be patient, my love.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:28.560
These things happen in every family.

01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.650
Next month,

01:28:34.510 --> 01:28:36.560
it will be 21 years, right?

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.620
21 years.

01:28:42.620 --> 01:28:44.500
Up in smoke.

01:28:47.730 --> 01:28:50.550
All my professional credibility.

01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:56.640
You can't lose your credibility

01:28:56.680 --> 01:28:59.650
because of something
that's out of your hands.

01:29:01.520 --> 01:29:02.680
Don't be so worried.

01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:06.680
Yes.

01:29:08.720 --> 01:29:10.530
I can.

01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:17.610
But I won't let it happen.

01:30:05.660 --> 01:30:07.590
Dad is about to have a stroke.

01:30:07.710 --> 01:30:10.730
If something happens to him,
it's your fault.

01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:12.730
Really, Mom?

01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:15.730
You said people had strokes every day

01:30:16.530 --> 01:30:19.520
and it was no one's fault,
just bad luck.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.730
But if it's Dad, it's our fault?

01:30:22.670 --> 01:30:24.610
You've got some nerve.

01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.720
If this damn gun is not found,
your dad will do 3 years of jail.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:32.600
3 years.

01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:37.590
Why do you assume it's us?

01:30:38.690 --> 01:30:41.540
We could point the finger at her.

01:30:42.650 --> 01:30:43.700
Don't know.

01:30:54.730 --> 01:30:57.500
Sana, what's going on with her?

01:30:59.670 --> 01:31:01.590
Mom, aren't you eating?

01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:04.590
No.

01:31:04.630 --> 01:31:05.670
Why?

01:31:16.570 --> 01:31:17.590
Mom...

01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:19.590
Mom!

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.500
You don't realize
what you're doing to him.

01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:28.730
What are we doing?

01:31:29.530 --> 01:31:31.550
If you'd grown up like me

01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:34.660
with a father who only cared about
gambling and partying,

01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.650
you'd be more grateful.

01:31:36.690 --> 01:31:39.520
You'd honor your father.

01:31:39.730 --> 01:31:41.690
I understand, Mom.

01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:45.500
I know you suffered as a child.

01:31:45.730 --> 01:31:48.710
But why do you always think
Dad is right?

01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:52.570
Why would Sana and I
take the gun?

01:31:52.710 --> 01:31:55.510
So it just flew away?

01:31:55.550 --> 01:31:56.730
Maybe Dad is lying...

01:31:57.530 --> 01:31:59.550
Mind what you say about your father!

01:31:59.590 --> 01:32:02.560
OK, the gun was in the drawer

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:03.730
of his nightstand.

01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.590
Do you really think Sana and I

01:32:06.630 --> 01:32:08.650
would dare come in
while you're asleep

01:32:08.690 --> 01:32:11.590
and take it from the drawer?

01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:14.660
What are we talking about anyway?

01:32:14.700 --> 01:32:18.550
Dad is so spaced out these days,
he's left it somewhere

01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:20.650
and he's taking it out on us.

01:32:20.690 --> 01:32:22.600
She's right, Mom.

01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:23.730
Think about it.

01:32:28.530 --> 01:32:29.560
Here, eat.

01:32:29.690 --> 01:32:30.720
Mom...

01:32:34.700 --> 01:32:36.630
You shouldn't have told your family

01:32:36.670 --> 01:32:38.520
about your work.

01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:39.690
I should have hidden it?

01:32:39.730 --> 01:32:41.500
Of course.

01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:42.590
Until when?

01:32:42.630 --> 01:32:43.670
To the grave.

01:32:46.710 --> 01:32:48.680
I'm in deep shit.

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:52.510
It's normal.

01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:55.650
In our training, they don't teach

01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:59.550
an investigator
how to interrogate their family.

01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:07.560
Don't you suspect any of them?

01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:12.570
I can't believe my daughters did it.

01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:14.630
And your wife?

01:33:15.550 --> 01:33:16.730
I have absolute confidence in her.

01:33:17.530 --> 01:33:18.550
Really?

01:33:23.730 --> 01:33:26.670
There's only one way
to find out who did it.

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:28.700
What?

01:33:29.530 --> 01:33:30.550
Alireza.

01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:32.580
Take them to him.

01:33:33.650 --> 01:33:35.710
- To Alireza?
- Yes.

01:33:41.660 --> 01:33:44.520
He's the best interrogator there is.

01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:48.580
He has psychological tricks,
he'll figure it out quickly.

01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:50.620
How could I?

01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.600
He comes over often.

01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:55.540
Our wives are friends.

01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:57.550
Our kids are friends.

01:33:57.680 --> 01:34:00.500
How can he interrogate my family?

01:34:00.540 --> 01:34:01.660
Why interrogate?

01:34:04.530 --> 01:34:06.720
He uses psychology
and body language techniques.

01:34:07.520 --> 01:34:10.530
He'll tell you who's got it.
Isn't that worth it?

01:34:10.570 --> 01:34:11.700
You want to be let go?

01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:14.600
You want us both to be on the hook?

01:34:14.710 --> 01:34:17.530
Make this go away.

01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:21.560
I won't take them to him.

01:34:23.690 --> 01:34:25.700
Do you know anyone safer?

01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:27.550
Any better way?

01:34:27.590 --> 01:34:29.710
Tell yourself it's a therapy session.

01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:57.560
Alireza and Fatemeh are our friends.

01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:00.720
They don't need to know about
our personal problems.

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:04.530
I told him not to mention it
to his family.

01:35:04.620 --> 01:35:07.510
They're a couple.
They tell each other everything.

01:35:07.550 --> 01:35:10.730
How dare you have your children
interrogated by your friend?

01:35:11.530 --> 01:35:12.630
Why interrogate?

01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.590
It's a psychotherapy session.

01:35:15.630 --> 01:35:18.620
He'll make sure
they don't recognize him.

01:35:22.570 --> 01:35:25.660
After this,
who can the girls confide in?

01:35:26.650 --> 01:35:27.680
You?

01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:29.580
Me?

01:35:29.650 --> 01:35:30.720
Their friends?

01:35:34.690 --> 01:35:36.570
What can I do?

01:35:36.720 --> 01:35:40.530
If they find out at court,
do you know what will happen?

01:35:41.680 --> 01:35:45.520
If they discover
the gun was taken from my home?

01:35:48.710 --> 01:35:52.630
We'll see him for half an hour,
he'll do the interviews

01:35:52.670 --> 01:35:53.670
and make his diagnosis.

01:35:53.710 --> 01:35:55.650
We'll be done with it.

01:35:56.630 --> 01:35:58.650
He's a specialist.

01:36:03.650 --> 01:36:05.640
Is it filmed?

01:36:06.500 --> 01:36:07.580
What?

01:36:07.710 --> 01:36:10.600
You said interrogations are filmed.

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.640
Of course not,
what are you talking about?

01:36:16.590 --> 01:36:18.590
What will we tell the girls?

01:36:20.500 --> 01:36:22.510
That it's a therapy session.

01:36:38.520 --> 01:36:39.600
It's here.

01:36:41.690 --> 01:36:43.540
It won't take long.

01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:46.540
I'll wait for you.

01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:47.670
OK.

01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:49.670
Let's go, girls.

01:37:32.650 --> 01:37:33.630
Hello.

01:37:33.670 --> 01:37:35.570
Hello, come in.

01:37:35.610 --> 01:37:36.620
Come in.

01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:40.560
Arms up.

01:37:40.630 --> 01:37:41.660
Come on.

01:37:44.700 --> 01:37:47.650
The other one too.
You have something on you?

01:37:48.540 --> 01:37:49.570
Go sit.

01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:51.540
Come on, quick.

01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:54.580
Arms up, legs spread.

01:37:58.500 --> 01:37:59.660
Go sit there too.

01:38:01.700 --> 01:38:03.610
- What do you have on you?
- Nothing.

01:38:03.650 --> 01:38:05.660
- A phone in your bag?
- Yes.

01:38:05.700 --> 01:38:07.540
Let me see.

01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:08.720
Arms up.

01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:11.520
Legs spread.

01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:15.680
Go wait there.

01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:32.600
Mom...

01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:33.710
Yes, honey?

01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:36.570
Come here.

01:38:46.590 --> 01:38:48.710
Girls, this way.

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:51.670
Get up.

01:38:52.630 --> 01:38:53.660
Let's go.

01:39:02.530 --> 01:39:03.670
It's on your right.

01:39:06.570 --> 01:39:08.650
You're here and you're there.

01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:30.560
Hello.

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.540
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.

01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:35.590
- Fatemeh is fine?
- Thank God.

01:39:35.630 --> 01:39:36.720
Reyhaneh and Amir Mahdi too?

01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:38.600
Yes, thank you.

01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:40.600
Follow me.

01:39:40.730 --> 01:39:42.660
You want to talk to me too?

01:39:42.700 --> 01:39:44.630
I have a few small questions.

01:39:44.670 --> 01:39:46.650
Iman said it's just the girls.

01:39:46.690 --> 01:39:48.570
Please, this way.

01:40:23.730 --> 01:40:26.520
Don't turn, face the wall.

01:40:35.650 --> 01:40:37.720
- Can you see here?
- Where?

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.560
Down here.

01:40:40.530 --> 01:40:41.610
Could you write?

01:40:41.650 --> 01:40:43.590
No, I can't see.

01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:46.730
- And now?
- Yes.

01:40:49.510 --> 01:40:50.680
Don't move, I'll be back.

01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:08.590
I cannot believe
the girls would have taken the gun.

01:41:09.710 --> 01:41:13.550
In general, the criminal
is not the one you imagine.

01:41:15.610 --> 01:41:17.670
What crime are we talking about?

01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:21.680
I'm sure Iman has left it somewhere.

01:41:22.670 --> 01:41:25.580
You know how it's been lately.

01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:28.730
You are all under pressure
due to all of the arrests.

01:41:29.550 --> 01:41:31.670
Iman is really perturbed.

01:41:32.630 --> 01:41:35.520
He's had to sign a few indictments

01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:37.620
that have deeply troubled him.

01:41:38.620 --> 01:41:39.680
I see.

01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:44.540
But Iman is sure he put it away
in its place at home.

01:41:44.630 --> 01:41:48.510
He told me the same thing,
but it's unlikely.

01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:52.580
The other night, he came home
very upset and went for a shower.

01:41:52.620 --> 01:41:55.590
Then I found the gun
in the bathroom.

01:41:55.630 --> 01:41:57.600
Just by chance.

01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.650
I put it in its place.

01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:03.530
So you think
the gun is not at your home.

01:42:03.690 --> 01:42:04.710
Yes.

01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:11.710
And you?

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:14.510
What about me?

01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:18.620
Might you know where it is?

01:42:19.730 --> 01:42:21.710
What do you mean?

01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.590
I would have taken it?

01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:28.550
You just said
you're sure it's not in your home.

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:33.610
Well, thank you.

01:42:34.510 --> 01:42:35.710
Thank Iman.

01:42:36.510 --> 01:42:38.530
Don't take it badly.

01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:42.540
Iman told me
he has absolute confidence in you.

01:42:42.580 --> 01:42:44.580
But everyone knows

01:42:44.710 --> 01:42:47.580
sometimes between
mother and daughters,

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:49.570
there are secrets.

01:42:51.590 --> 01:42:53.610
Absolutely not.

01:42:53.650 --> 01:42:56.580
Why would I hide this
from my husband?

01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:57.660
God as my witness,

01:42:57.700 --> 01:43:00.680
I've always been transparent
with Iman.

01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:06.590
Yet I know

01:43:06.660 --> 01:43:09.650
there are things
that Iman doesn't know.

01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:15.680
Stay seated, please.

01:43:15.720 --> 01:43:18.670
You're speaking in an offending way.

01:43:18.710 --> 01:43:20.510
Sit down.

01:43:26.620 --> 01:43:29.560
I'm speaking to you
very respectfully.

01:43:30.620 --> 01:43:34.690
Never has a person sitting there
been treated with such respect.

01:43:40.620 --> 01:43:42.540
Be reassured,

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.700
all this will remain between us.

01:43:47.690 --> 01:43:49.680
I'm the keeper of secrets.

01:43:53.510 --> 01:43:56.630
I thought perhaps this issue
might be one of those

01:43:56.670 --> 01:43:59.570
that you have decided
to hide from Iman.

01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:04.520
I can't understand this disaster
taking over my life.

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.710
Be precise and thorough.

01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:12.680
Especially concerning the young girl
you were looking for.

01:47:22.560 --> 01:47:23.580
You, go to your room.

01:47:24.510 --> 01:47:25.520
No, stay.

01:47:27.580 --> 01:47:29.540
We have nothing to hide.

01:47:34.510 --> 01:47:36.580
Do you realize what you're doing?

01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.550
What am I doing?

01:47:40.650 --> 01:47:42.630
Playing with your dad's reputation.

01:47:42.710 --> 01:47:44.610
The family's reputation.

01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:45.710
Sweetheart,

01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:51.540
this issue has the potential
to ruin my career.

01:47:53.670 --> 01:47:55.610
I'll be put in jail.

01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:57.730
Don't you care?

01:47:59.630 --> 01:48:01.610
- It's not me...
- Who, then?

01:48:04.670 --> 01:48:05.730
Rezvan,

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:09.720
honey,

01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:11.580
don't be scared.

01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:14.560
No harm will come to you.

01:48:14.690 --> 01:48:16.640
Just give me the gun back.

01:48:16.710 --> 01:48:18.600
What gun?

01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:21.510
Why won't you believe me?

01:48:21.550 --> 01:48:23.720
You accuse me
because of what a stranger says!

01:48:24.520 --> 01:48:25.570
Where's the gun then?

01:48:25.610 --> 01:48:27.650
Did it vanish into thin air?
Where is it?

01:48:27.690 --> 01:48:29.500
I have no idea!

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:31.540
Maybe you have it!

01:48:49.590 --> 01:48:50.670
Calm down, sweetie.

01:48:54.600 --> 01:48:57.550
All you've been given
is love and respect.

01:49:01.730 --> 01:49:04.710
The best house, everything you need,

01:49:05.610 --> 01:49:07.590
a car, money...

01:49:07.630 --> 01:49:09.570
What have you been missing?

01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:14.610
I didn't take it, Dad.

01:49:14.650 --> 01:49:16.600
I swear I didn't.

01:49:16.710 --> 01:49:19.610
I swear on whatever you want.

01:49:19.650 --> 01:49:21.690
Why won't you believe me?

01:49:21.730 --> 01:49:24.650
I didn't even know you had a gun.

01:49:24.690 --> 01:49:26.560
Leave me alone.

01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:33.540
You won't believe me.
Leave me alone!

01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:36.580
I'll find it.

01:49:37.590 --> 01:49:38.620
Mom...

01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:40.720
Mom, wait...

01:49:41.730 --> 01:49:44.580
What are you doing?

01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:48.570
Please, don't start again.
You've already searched everywhere.

01:49:48.610 --> 01:49:49.590
Mom!

01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:51.640
Calm down, you're not well.

01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:53.500
Did she tell you anything?

01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:54.710
It's my turn?

01:49:55.510 --> 01:49:57.510
Don't you want to have blue hair?

01:49:57.550 --> 01:50:00.730
Your father will promise you can.
Go ahead, Iman.

01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:03.660
Sweetie,

01:50:04.570 --> 01:50:06.580
Rezvan isn't in her right mind.

01:50:06.620 --> 01:50:09.720
If you know something, say so,
you'll do her a favor.

01:50:10.670 --> 01:50:14.530
And I'll let you dye your hair,
paint your nails.

01:50:18.660 --> 01:50:20.590
She didn't tell me anything.

01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:41.530
Sana knows something.

01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:45.500
I can see it in her eyes.

01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:49.620
She's a child.

01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:52.600
This isn't the court, it's your home.

01:50:52.660 --> 01:50:55.610
A mistake has been made,
but as you said,

01:50:55.650 --> 01:50:58.540
one shouldn't burn bridges.

01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:04.500
What curse has fallen upon me.

01:51:06.570 --> 01:51:07.660
You have us.

01:51:12.630 --> 01:51:14.550
They'll call me incompetent.

01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:16.530
Who?

01:51:16.690 --> 01:51:20.600
I've always said
you built this life from nothing.

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:22.650
With no support, on your own,

01:51:22.690 --> 01:51:24.590
with no help.

01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:27.650
Iman...

01:51:28.620 --> 01:51:30.650
your dream is coming true.

01:51:30.690 --> 01:51:34.580
You're only a few steps away
from the judge's chair.

01:51:35.610 --> 01:51:36.650
Yes.

01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:38.720
A few steps.

01:51:40.660 --> 01:51:42.660
But fate has changed.

01:51:45.710 --> 01:51:48.680
Your name is Iman.
How can you lose faith?

01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:53.600
You'll make it right.

01:51:59.510 --> 01:52:01.560
I'd like to hug Rezvan.

01:52:01.690 --> 01:52:03.510
Kiss Sana.

01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:06.730
Go ahead, hug them, kiss them.

01:52:07.560 --> 01:52:08.610
Now?

01:52:20.720 --> 01:52:22.510
Najmeh...

01:52:22.630 --> 01:52:23.670
Yes, my love?

01:52:25.630 --> 01:52:27.680
Sana wants to have blue hair?

01:52:28.670 --> 01:52:30.580
Painted nails?

01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:32.620
Why?

01:52:34.590 --> 01:52:36.510
The world has changed.

01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:38.670
Kids think differently.

01:52:39.530 --> 01:52:41.680
The world has changed,
but God has not.

01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:44.510
Nor his laws.

01:52:45.610 --> 01:52:47.570
We have to teach them.

01:52:47.640 --> 01:52:49.610
We always have.

01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:53.560
Sana is going through puberty.

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:56.570
She's influenced by her friends.

01:52:56.720 --> 01:52:59.520
She shouldn't see them.

01:53:03.630 --> 01:53:06.680
You must spend more time with them.

01:53:07.510 --> 01:53:10.590
So that you get closer,
become more intimate.

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:15.580
You have to help shape their ideas.

01:53:19.670 --> 01:53:20.680
Yes.

01:53:40.690 --> 01:53:41.730
Najmeh.

01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:46.730
Yes, my love?

01:53:47.590 --> 01:53:48.650
Come close to me.

01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:15.560
Mom!

01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:22.570
- What's that?
- Dad's contact info was posted.

01:54:22.610 --> 01:54:24.590
Even our address.

01:54:24.630 --> 01:54:26.550
Good God...

01:54:26.620 --> 01:54:28.540
My Goodness.

01:54:29.590 --> 01:54:30.660
Let me see.

01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:44.720
I told you to be careful.

01:54:49.540 --> 01:54:51.620
They wanna do away with me.

01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:53.640
You have to report it all.

01:54:54.730 --> 01:54:57.650
Write a letter to the boss now.

01:54:58.590 --> 01:55:01.550
Say your personal info
has been revealed online

01:55:01.590 --> 01:55:03.590
and that you're in danger.

01:55:03.710 --> 01:55:07.630
Ask for secure official housing.

01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:14.650
Drop the letter off and rush home.

01:55:15.610 --> 01:55:16.720
Take your family

01:55:17.520 --> 01:55:19.540
and go to a safe place for a while.

01:55:19.580 --> 01:55:21.580
Until things settle down.

01:55:22.530 --> 01:55:23.610
I have two of them.

01:55:23.650 --> 01:55:25.640
Keep one for now.

01:55:31.610 --> 01:55:32.730
Thank you so much.

01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:06.600
Yes?

01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:09.530
Yes?

01:59:10.580 --> 01:59:11.600
Who is it?

01:59:11.640 --> 01:59:13.530
Nobody rang.

01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:29.630
Iman... you're OK?

01:59:29.670 --> 01:59:31.580
Yes... I'm OK.

01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:33.520
What shall we do?

01:59:33.560 --> 01:59:34.710
Give me your phone.

01:59:35.560 --> 01:59:37.630
My phone? Here.

01:59:41.520 --> 01:59:42.600
Hi, Dad.

01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:43.680
Hi.

01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:45.540
Your phone.

01:59:45.630 --> 01:59:46.700
Cut the music.

01:59:56.570 --> 01:59:57.600
Your code.

02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:02.690
2003.

02:00:04.520 --> 02:00:05.510
Iman?

02:00:06.630 --> 02:00:07.630
Iman?

02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:09.500
Sana.

02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:16.580
Your code.

02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:20.650
Give it to me.

02:00:35.730 --> 02:00:37.610
Najmeh, your code.

02:00:37.650 --> 02:00:39.570
You know it.

02:00:43.660 --> 02:00:45.630
Everyone at the table in 10 minutes.

02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:07.710
I'm worried.

02:01:09.510 --> 02:01:11.640
Strange things have been happening.

02:01:12.620 --> 02:01:14.680
We'll leave Tehran for a few days.

02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:17.650
We'll go to my birthplace.

02:01:18.610 --> 02:01:20.680
You loved going there
when you were little.

02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:23.670
I haven't had time
to take you there lately.

02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:26.580
It's the right moment.

02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:30.580
Over there we will become
the family we were.

02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:33.660
And try to work things out.

02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:38.500
Get ready, we're leaving in an hour.

02:03:23.570 --> 02:03:24.720
Dad, can I have my phone back?

02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:26.700
Rezvan, drop it.

02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:29.720
- I want to check on my friend.
- Get in the car.

02:03:30.520 --> 02:03:31.530
Come on, get in.

02:03:58.630 --> 02:04:00.680
- Anything wrong?
- No.

02:04:01.590 --> 02:04:03.660
You seem weird.
Did someone recognize you?

02:04:03.700 --> 02:04:05.710
They took photos and videos of us.

02:04:06.510 --> 02:04:07.690
What are you going to do?

02:04:07.730 --> 02:04:09.570
Masks on.

02:04:09.610 --> 02:04:11.560
Girls, masks.

02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:13.640
Sana, wake up,

02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:14.710
put a mask on.

02:04:15.510 --> 02:04:16.530
What's going on?

02:04:16.570 --> 02:04:18.650
Dad and the car were filmed.

02:04:18.690 --> 02:04:19.730
By who?

02:04:20.530 --> 02:04:23.670
Iman, please, let's go.
You said it would be all over.

02:04:23.710 --> 02:04:26.690
I won't let anyone hurt us.

02:04:26.730 --> 02:04:28.580
Please, drop it.

02:04:28.620 --> 02:04:31.530
Please, Dad, let's just go.

02:04:31.570 --> 02:04:33.730
Are you sure he filmed us?

02:04:34.530 --> 02:04:36.680
The glove box.
Take out your phone.

02:04:36.720 --> 02:04:39.730
When I tell you,
film his car with the license plate.

02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:08.550
She's also filming us.

02:05:08.590 --> 02:05:10.500
You're going too fast.

02:05:23.540 --> 02:05:25.630
Don't you see the girls are scared?

02:05:29.660 --> 02:05:31.560
Careful, Dad!

02:05:33.590 --> 02:05:34.630
Dad!

02:05:43.730 --> 02:05:45.630
We'll crash!

02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:47.670
Please, drop it!

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:30.510
Stay in the car.

02:06:30.550 --> 02:06:32.560
So, investigator, you're scared?

02:06:32.600 --> 02:06:34.700
Afraid your family
will find out what you do?

02:06:35.500 --> 02:06:36.600
Your father is an executioner!

02:06:36.690 --> 02:06:38.540
Drop your phone.

02:06:38.580 --> 02:06:40.580
Go ahead, shoot, if you dare!

02:06:40.620 --> 02:06:41.660
His gun!

02:06:42.510 --> 02:06:44.520
He didn't tell us he found it.

02:06:45.540 --> 02:06:46.720
It's another one.

02:06:47.680 --> 02:06:49.630
What have you done, Sana?

02:06:50.670 --> 02:06:52.570
- Give it to me.
- I'll keep it.

02:06:52.610 --> 02:06:53.620
Leave it!

02:06:53.660 --> 02:06:55.520
Dad's lost it.
Grab the phones.

02:06:55.560 --> 02:06:56.720
Let's call Uncle Assad.

02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:58.580
Shut up, you whore!

02:06:58.620 --> 02:07:01.640
Do you know how many death
sentence requests he's signed?

02:07:01.720 --> 02:07:03.650
There's no signal!

02:07:03.690 --> 02:07:05.720
Have you read about him?

02:07:06.520 --> 02:07:08.680
- Sana, quick!
- I have no signal!

02:07:08.720 --> 02:07:12.520
I'm better than you
who feeds on the blood of the people.

02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:16.670
- Call Assad...
- There's no signal.

02:07:16.710 --> 02:07:19.730
I'm streaming this live to the world
to put you to shame.

02:07:20.530 --> 02:07:21.720
She's lying, there's no signal.

02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:23.710
She can't send anything.

02:07:26.500 --> 02:07:27.520
Throw your phone.

02:07:28.710 --> 02:07:29.710
I swear I'll shoot!

02:07:30.510 --> 02:07:32.710
Throw it, he may really shoot!

02:07:35.500 --> 02:07:36.520
Tie her up.

02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:38.550
ID and phone.

02:07:38.590 --> 02:07:40.550
- Hands behind your back.
- Quick!

02:09:11.540 --> 02:09:12.640
- Not you!
- Here we are!

02:09:12.680 --> 02:09:14.640
It's a couple's photo.

02:09:15.570 --> 02:09:17.510
I've got you.

02:09:17.730 --> 02:09:18.730
Daddy!

02:09:21.590 --> 02:09:22.660
- Yes?
- Sing.

02:09:22.710 --> 02:09:24.630
What song?

02:09:24.670 --> 02:09:26.530
"From my heart"

02:09:26.570 --> 02:09:27.550
No, another one.

02:09:27.590 --> 02:09:28.700
Please, Daddy.

02:09:30.730 --> 02:09:32.550
No, I said!

02:09:32.590 --> 02:09:34.560
- Yes, sir!
- Good boy.

02:09:47.590 --> 02:09:49.580
So you found the gun?

02:09:52.600 --> 02:09:53.700
No, I didn't.

02:09:56.660 --> 02:10:00.500
This is Ghaderi's. He lent it to me.

02:10:04.690 --> 02:10:07.630
So the nightmare is not over.

02:10:09.580 --> 02:10:10.570
Soon.

02:10:16.500 --> 02:10:17.520
Shit.

02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:20.600
It must be the fuses.

02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:22.500
I'll check.

02:11:28.540 --> 02:11:29.550
Sana...

02:11:29.620 --> 02:11:30.640
Thanks.

02:11:32.610 --> 02:11:34.670
- I put it here?
- Yes, thanks.

02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:38.570
It's so nice of you.

02:11:38.610 --> 02:11:39.700
My pleasure.

02:11:40.500 --> 02:11:41.570
A feast of a breakfast.

02:11:41.610 --> 02:11:43.510
It's only normal.

02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:45.690
Thank you.

02:11:47.640 --> 02:11:51.520
Dad, when will we have
our phones back? It's boring here.

02:11:51.730 --> 02:11:54.670
Be patient, you'll have them.

02:12:01.550 --> 02:12:02.700
You think it's which one?

02:12:03.500 --> 02:12:04.690
The one with the plaid shirt.

02:12:04.730 --> 02:12:08.510
That's Uncle Ali, for sure.
I think he's the other one.

02:12:08.550 --> 02:12:09.520
Dad!

02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:10.660
- Is it you?
- Yes.

02:12:10.700 --> 02:12:12.670
It's at the Imam Reza shrine.

02:12:12.710 --> 02:12:14.660
Why are you doing this?

02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:18.660
It's a gesture of submission,
faith, absolute obedience.

02:12:19.500 --> 02:12:21.630
I see, what Dad expects from us.

02:12:21.670 --> 02:12:23.620
It's not for me,

02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:24.680
it's for God.

02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:27.720
Why are you interfering
in our relationship with God?

02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:29.720
- Sana!
- Let her talk.

02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:31.680
That's no way to talk.

02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:33.590
I'm just asking a question.

02:12:33.710 --> 02:12:37.660
In faith, there are no questions.
You have to feel it in your bones.

02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:40.620
Woe to him who loses his faith.

02:12:55.650 --> 02:12:58.570
What's undermining our family
is lies.

02:12:59.550 --> 02:13:01.560
I don't care about the gun anymore.

02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:03.500
I want the liar.

02:13:06.600 --> 02:13:09.520
I want my family back.

02:13:09.610 --> 02:13:12.500
You have one hour
to hand over the liar.

02:13:19.690 --> 02:13:21.690
It shouldn't have come to this.

02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:26.710
Why does he get to do
whatever he wants?

02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:31.610
He's the first liar.
For years he hid his job from us.

02:13:32.540 --> 02:13:33.720
We're up against the wall.

02:13:34.580 --> 02:13:36.540
I know your father well.

02:13:36.580 --> 02:13:38.660
- Whoever's done it needs to give in.
- Mom...

02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:40.640
I'm begging you.

02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:43.730
No matter who did it,
just stop playing around.

02:13:44.530 --> 02:13:45.590
Give it to me.

02:13:45.630 --> 02:13:47.580
I stole it, I'm the liar.

02:13:47.620 --> 02:13:49.620
You always give in to him.

02:13:50.550 --> 02:13:54.540
I've always made sure you never see
your father's true colors.

02:13:55.540 --> 02:13:57.510
Which of you has the gun?

02:14:05.530 --> 02:14:06.640
We don't know anything.

02:14:07.730 --> 02:14:10.540
Is that your final word?

02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:12.500
Fine.

02:14:30.530 --> 02:14:31.580
Sit down.

02:14:36.670 --> 02:14:37.730
So,

02:14:39.570 --> 02:14:41.700
I've been living with a liar
for 20 years.

02:14:50.570 --> 02:14:52.610
Can the girls go out?

02:14:57.570 --> 02:14:58.670
Why?

02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:01.560
Let them see.

02:15:06.530 --> 02:15:08.510
What else did you lie about?

02:15:11.690 --> 02:15:14.570
I didn't lie about anything else.

02:15:17.550 --> 02:15:21.650
From the start, you were excited
to have this gun at home.

02:15:21.690 --> 02:15:23.630
But I was scared.

02:15:25.710 --> 02:15:27.600
Where's the gun?

02:15:30.600 --> 02:15:33.630
I threw it into the canal
near our house.

02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:38.600
One lie

02:15:38.720 --> 02:15:40.540
after the other.

02:15:43.590 --> 02:15:45.720
Are you taking the blame
for the girls?

02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:50.670
I'm not lying.

02:15:50.710 --> 02:15:53.720
I made a mistake, I apologize.

02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:55.600
Please forgive me.

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:59.710
Let's go back home
and I'll show you where I threw it.

02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:02.620
We might find it.

02:16:07.570 --> 02:16:10.590
Explain when and how
you stole the gun.

02:16:13.690 --> 02:16:16.600
The night you had a nightmare,

02:16:16.640 --> 02:16:19.580
I woke you up
and gave you some water.

02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:20.690
Remember?

02:16:22.590 --> 02:16:23.730
You went to the living room.

02:16:24.670 --> 02:16:27.610
I took it then.

02:16:32.540 --> 02:16:33.640
Where did you hide it?

02:16:34.530 --> 02:16:35.680
When did you throw it?

02:16:40.620 --> 02:16:41.660
I hid it

02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:45.530
in the freezer,
between pieces of meat.

02:16:47.730 --> 02:16:49.510
Then,

02:16:49.550 --> 02:16:53.550
in the morning, when you left,
I went to throw it into the canal.

02:16:55.660 --> 02:16:58.600
You didn't think
of your husband's reputation?

02:17:01.630 --> 02:17:04.700
Iman, please, that's enough,
let's go back to Tehran.

02:17:05.500 --> 02:17:07.600
I'll tell everyone it was me.

02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:10.520
I won't let you be harmed.

02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:11.670
The girls are really scared.

02:17:12.670 --> 02:17:14.630
I'll come to any court

02:17:14.670 --> 02:17:17.510
to confess I took the gun.

02:17:17.550 --> 02:17:19.590
You'll be off the hook,
don't be afraid.

02:17:19.630 --> 02:17:21.620
I'm not afraid of anybody!

02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:25.580
So what do you want the gun for?

02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:30.620
Enough, Mom, get up.

02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:33.600
Stop it, I don't want you
to be involved in this.

02:17:33.640 --> 02:17:35.640
We've been involved
since the beginning.

02:17:39.630 --> 02:17:41.570
I have your gun.

02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:44.620
It's here.

02:17:45.610 --> 02:17:48.700
Ask Uncle Assad to come and pick up
Mom and Sana.

02:17:49.620 --> 02:17:51.720
Then, I'll give it to you.

02:18:01.650 --> 02:18:03.690
Are you making conditions for me?

02:18:12.530 --> 02:18:14.550
Sit down in front of the camera.

02:18:18.510 --> 02:18:19.540
I won't sit.

02:18:24.650 --> 02:18:25.670
You will.

02:18:31.530 --> 02:18:33.520
Rezvan sweetheart,

02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:35.670
come sit for a minute.

02:18:35.710 --> 02:18:37.610
We'll talk.

02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:39.670
Come, my love.

02:18:39.710 --> 02:18:41.700
Let your father calm down.

02:18:50.640 --> 02:18:53.720
When and how you stole the gun,
for what motive?

02:18:59.610 --> 02:19:00.600
I won't answer.

02:19:00.640 --> 02:19:02.620
Don't get smart with me!

02:19:05.530 --> 02:19:06.670
Answer him.

02:19:08.650 --> 02:19:10.500
I told you,

02:19:10.540 --> 02:19:12.560
I have it here, in the garden.

02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:15.620
Let Mom and Sana leave

02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:17.500
and I'll give it to you.

02:19:17.540 --> 02:19:18.680
Don't make conditions!

02:19:21.530 --> 02:19:22.690
Rezvan, honey,

02:19:23.650 --> 02:19:25.680
since you're saying
you have it here,

02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:29.510
why don't you give it back to him?

02:20:16.600 --> 02:20:17.640
It's not here.

02:20:21.680 --> 02:20:23.600
You're all liars.

02:20:24.670 --> 02:20:27.580
I swear I left it here.

02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:54.530
You're hurting me!

02:21:08.540 --> 02:21:09.630
Open the door!

02:21:10.560 --> 02:21:11.640
Open!

02:21:12.580 --> 02:21:13.620
Mom!

02:21:14.500 --> 02:21:14.720
Open!

02:21:15.520 --> 02:21:16.510
Iman!

02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:17.690
Are you out of your mind?

02:21:17.730 --> 02:21:19.660
You've gone crazy!

02:21:20.690 --> 02:21:22.600
Mom, you're OK?

02:21:22.730 --> 02:21:25.590
Rezvan, honey, I'm here.

02:21:25.630 --> 02:21:27.710
Don't be scared, my love, I'm here.

02:24:00.730 --> 02:24:02.540
Take this.

02:24:05.570 --> 02:24:06.610
Open it!

02:24:06.710 --> 02:24:07.720
Open it!

02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:09.700
Open the door!

02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:14.610
Iman, where's Sana?

02:24:15.590 --> 02:24:18.610
It's cold, she'll get sick.

02:24:19.700 --> 02:24:23.510
It's not safe out there.
There are wild animals.

02:24:23.630 --> 02:24:25.550
Let's go find her.

02:24:26.580 --> 02:24:28.520
I don't want this!

02:24:28.570 --> 02:24:29.730
What are you doing?

02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:32.630
We're your family!

02:24:32.730 --> 02:24:34.730
My baby will get scared!

02:24:35.530 --> 02:24:38.590
If something happens to her,
I'll never forgive you!

02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:39.630
Iman!

02:24:39.690 --> 02:24:41.590
My baby's all alone!

02:24:41.700 --> 02:24:43.530
She'll get lost!

02:24:43.570 --> 02:24:44.650
Iman!

02:26:48.630 --> 02:26:49.730
Where are you?

02:26:50.630 --> 02:26:52.580
Can you hear me?

02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:56.540
Come open this door!

02:26:56.640 --> 02:26:58.710
Iman,
she needs to go to the bathroom!

02:26:59.510 --> 02:27:00.540
Open up!

02:27:00.580 --> 02:27:03.650
- I need to go!
- Open up, I'm telling you!

02:27:05.670 --> 02:27:08.570
If you shout next time,
I won't open up.

02:27:08.610 --> 02:27:10.700
Tap gently on the door...

02:27:11.500 --> 02:27:13.500
- Mom!
- Let's go, quiet.

02:27:16.620 --> 02:27:18.700
Go in, I'll put the power back on.

02:27:19.500 --> 02:27:20.550
I'm going to the toilet!

02:28:05.700 --> 02:28:07.510
You brute!

02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:44.540
- Iman, take only me.
- Sure.

02:31:44.580 --> 02:31:45.550
If they let me.

02:31:45.590 --> 02:31:47.640
- Daddy!
- Wait.

02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:48.670
Let's do a selfie.

02:31:48.710 --> 02:31:49.730
Daddy!

02:31:51.580 --> 02:31:52.590
Yes, honey?

02:31:52.630 --> 02:31:54.730
Stop saying Daddy for a second!

02:31:55.600 --> 02:31:58.580
Dad, take one alone and then...

02:32:44.550 --> 02:32:45.560
Sana!

02:33:51.610 --> 02:33:52.720
Open the door!

02:33:55.710 --> 02:33:57.600
Open up!

02:33:59.580 --> 02:34:00.710
Damn it!

02:34:18.690 --> 02:34:20.550
Sana, you're OK?

02:34:31.700 --> 02:34:33.510
Where's your father?

02:34:33.550 --> 02:34:35.530
He can't reach us!

02:34:46.650 --> 02:34:47.660
The car key!

02:34:47.700 --> 02:34:50.650
The gate is closed.
He'll be here soon!

02:34:53.560 --> 02:34:54.670
No, this way!

02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:07.520
Come on!

02:35:17.650 --> 02:35:18.690
Run!

02:35:19.670 --> 02:35:20.700
Faster!

02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:25.700
Come on, girls.

02:35:27.650 --> 02:35:29.510
Let's separate!

02:36:52.610 --> 02:36:53.610
Mom...

02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:56.530
Sana...

02:38:58.730 --> 02:39:00.730
- Rezvan!
- Mom!

02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:04.560
What the hell are you doing?

02:39:04.600 --> 02:39:06.530
- Run!
- Najmeh!

02:39:25.680 --> 02:39:27.600
Get out of my way.

02:39:27.640 --> 02:39:29.500
Quiet, sit down.

02:39:29.540 --> 02:39:31.720
I won't sit, I'm talking.
What are you going to do?

02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:33.730
You've already done it all.

02:39:34.570 --> 02:39:36.600
You haven't shot me yet.
Go ahead.

02:39:36.710 --> 02:39:39.580
Girls, he's here!

02:39:40.520 --> 02:39:41.500
Mom!

02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:44.580
I won't sit!

02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:45.690
Sana!

02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:48.620
I won't sit!

02:39:48.700 --> 02:39:49.720
Mom!

02:39:58.580 --> 02:39:59.620
Enough, let her go!

02:40:02.640 --> 02:40:04.510
Sana, my love.

02:40:04.550 --> 02:40:05.600
You're finally back.

02:40:05.640 --> 02:40:07.630
Let her go. Get up, Mom!

02:40:07.670 --> 02:40:08.700
Give him the gun.

02:40:10.660 --> 02:40:12.580
Don't hurt my girls.

02:40:12.620 --> 02:40:14.690
- You know to shoot, kid?
- Yes.

02:40:16.610 --> 02:40:17.690
First, you have to pull this.

02:40:18.530 --> 02:40:19.600
I know, it's armed.

02:40:21.730 --> 02:40:23.580
Where have you learnt?

02:40:23.620 --> 02:40:24.630
Stay back!

02:40:24.670 --> 02:40:26.660
I'm a nervous wreck, I'll shoot.

02:40:27.520 --> 02:40:28.660
Shoot your father?

02:40:28.730 --> 02:40:29.700
Yes.

02:40:30.590 --> 02:40:33.560
With what I've seen of you,
I'll definitely shoot.

02:40:33.650 --> 02:40:34.690
Go ahead, honey.

02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:38.570
Iman, if she gives it to you,

02:40:38.610 --> 02:40:40.550
it will be all over, right?

02:40:40.590 --> 02:40:41.610
It won't be over.

02:40:41.650 --> 02:40:44.700
It's always been this way.
You've always given in.

02:40:45.500 --> 02:40:46.620
You gave him everything.

02:40:46.660 --> 02:40:48.700
If I give it back, nothing changes.

02:40:49.500 --> 02:40:51.610
Please, Sana, sweetheart.

02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:53.520
Mom!

02:40:55.590 --> 02:40:56.720
Rezvan, tell him to stay back!

02:40:57.550 --> 02:40:58.570
Don't!

02:43:19.570 --> 02:43:23.570
