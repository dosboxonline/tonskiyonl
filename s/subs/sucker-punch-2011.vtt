01:52:42.256 --> 01:52:44.384
...freedom from loss...

01:52:47.970 --> 01:52:50.018
...the freedom to be happy.

01:53:00.524 --> 01:53:02.367
Don't close your eyes.

01:53:03.819 --> 01:53:05.446
I need you to look at me.

01:53:09.950 --> 01:53:11.793
The freedom to love.

01:53:32.764 --> 01:53:34.391
Jesus.

01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:40.651
Did--'?

01:53:41.648 --> 01:53:43.867
Did you see the way she looked at me?

01:53:45.902 --> 01:53:49.156
Just in that last moment. It was like ....

01:53:57.914 --> 01:53:59.382
Doctor?

01:53:59.708 --> 01:54:00.755
Is it done?

01:54:00.917 --> 01:54:04.672
Dr. Gorski, what do you know
about this one?

01:54:04.838 --> 01:54:07.466
Uh, there was something very peculiar.

01:54:07.632 --> 01:54:10.932
Yes. Her mother's death plunged her
into a deep depression.

01:54:11.094 --> 01:54:14.974
And then in a fit,
she accidentally killed her sister.

01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:16.266
Poor child.

01:54:17.225 --> 01:54:22.152
It's a shame I couldn't do more for her.
I wasn't given much time, you see.

01:54:22.314 --> 01:54:24.863
Yes, but you recommended
the procedure.

01:54:25.025 --> 01:54:26.777
Oh, I'm afraid not.

01:54:26.943 --> 01:54:29.287
I will admit she has been
quite a handful.

01:54:29.446 --> 01:54:34.327
In just one week here,
she stabbed an orderly, started a fire...

01:54:34.493 --> 01:54:37.121
...and helped another patient to escape.

01:54:39.414 --> 01:54:41.963
But I don't agree with this solution,
doctor.

01:54:42.125 --> 01:54:45.971
But why would you sign for a procedure
you don't agree with?

01:54:46.129 --> 01:54:47.472
Well, I--

01:54:51.468 --> 01:54:53.311
DOCTOR:
That is your signature, is it not?

01:54:53.929 --> 01:54:56.808
I've been doing this
for quite some time, doctor...

01:54:56.973 --> 01:55:00.648
...and to be honest with you, I've wondered
myself whether or not it's right.

01:55:00.811 --> 01:55:05.282
And I have seen some tortured souls
in here. Believe me.

01:55:05.440 --> 01:55:06.657
But this one ....

01:55:07.567 --> 01:55:09.661
Something in her eyes.

01:55:09.986 --> 01:55:12.239
I've never seen anyone that ....

01:55:13.156 --> 01:55:15.158
it's the way she looked at me.

01:55:15.325 --> 01:55:17.544
It's like she wanted me to do it.

01:55:22.249 --> 01:55:23.671
I hope it helps her.

01:56:07.085 --> 01:56:08.712
Hi.

01:56:12.174 --> 01:56:13.892
You remember me?

01:56:14.885 --> 01:56:18.355
Listen. Listen, I got a bad feeling, okay?

01:56:18.513 --> 01:56:19.730
These boys do too.

01:56:20.765 --> 01:56:22.813
This is not the way
we should be running this place.

01:56:22.976 --> 01:56:25.104

-I'm not hurting these girls anymore.
-I'm not doing this.

01:56:37.741 --> 01:56:40.995
Guys, don't do this to me now, please.

01:56:41.161 --> 01:56:42.913
I need her in that chair.

01:56:44.789 --> 01:56:47.588
Put her in the goddamn chair!

01:56:50.545 --> 01:56:52.263
Thank you.

01:56:55.884 --> 01:56:57.807

No! No!

That young woman's been on this bus
since Hartford.

02:00:15.917 --> 02:00:20.138
I don't see what she could possibly know
about anything happening around here.

02:00:20.296 --> 02:00:21.468
