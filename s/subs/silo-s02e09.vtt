WEBVTT

01:10.028 --> 01:11.113
It's Eater.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.217
Where did she come from?

01:33.218 --> 01:34.510
I don't know.
I heard someone running down.

01:34.511 --> 01:35.720
- I thought it was the Killer.
- No, it's not.

01:35.721 --> 01:38.723
It doesn't mean we're safe.
We don't know who she is.

01:38.724 --> 01:39.975
We could ask her.

01:40.726 --> 01:43.187
- It's just an idea.
- It's not your job to have ideas.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.780
What do we do?

01:54.740 --> 01:57.659
Watch her and check our weapons.

02:25.646 --> 02:26.647
Okay.

03:42.055 --> 03:44.849
I can't believe you.
Rick, what were you thinking?

03:44.850 --> 03:46.601
I had it under control.

03:46.602 --> 03:47.852
Why would you do that?

03:47.853 --> 03:50.313
- I was ju-- I--
- Spit it out!

03:50.314 --> 03:51.772
Because she was gonna die.

03:51.773 --> 03:53.858
Yeah, that was the point, Rick.

03:53.859 --> 03:55.484
I cut the rope.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.320
- Well, you--
- She was headed to IT.

03:57.321 --> 03:58.655
You could've told me.

04:43.367 --> 04:44.660
What is that?

04:55.879 --> 04:57.548
- Where is she?
- She went back in.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.264
Don't go!

05:05.764 --> 05:07.015
Do I look bad?

05:07.516 --> 05:09.225
- No, no, no. I--
- Is that--

05:09.226 --> 05:11.185
I just...
I thought maybe you'd look different.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.228
Is that the Killer?

05:12.229 --> 05:14.564
Hey. Wait, did I hurt you? Are you okay?

05:14.565 --> 05:16.984
- Yes! No! Kinda.
- No? Okay. Come on.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.737
- We have to kill him.
- I'm sorry.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.905
It's not your fault.

05:22.906 --> 05:23.991
It's okay.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.685
Okay.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.795
Why didn't you do it?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.549
But he can get us into the vault.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.886
- Shit.
- He's still breathing.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.429
- I'll finish it.
- No, no, no.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.474
He can't get us food if he's dead.

07:17.145 --> 07:18.522
We have to get out of here.

07:23.151 --> 07:24.319
Come on.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.244
Get the ax. And then tell us
if she's coming up.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.337
Hey, what did he say?

07:42.838 --> 07:44.380
I knew it. He didn't give you the code.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.175
- No, it was ju--
- I told you to get the ax.

07:47.176 --> 07:49.135
She came out of the water.
She's coming up the stairs.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.179
She's gonna see the blood. Fuck!

07:51.180 --> 07:52.513
No, I added blood.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.098
You added blood?

07:54.099 --> 07:56.517
Yeah. My own. To lead her away.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.227
You know, even if she finds us,
we could use her.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.354
Maybe if she's in danger,
he can give us the code.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.064
No, it's not worth the risk.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.650
If she gets too close, we scare her off.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.444
And then we kill him,
like we said we would,

08:06.445 --> 08:09.030
and leave his body
so she knows to stay the fuck away.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.866
- What if we try something else? What if--
- No one wants to hear your ideas.

08:11.867 --> 08:13.159
All right?

08:13.160 --> 08:16.371
Just keep a lookout and let us know
if she's coming or not.

08:20.876 --> 08:22.044
Audrey, wait.

08:53.659 --> 08:54.660
Stop!

09:08.632 --> 09:09.633
Hey!

09:11.885 --> 09:13.678
I already put one arrow in your shoulder.

09:13.679 --> 09:16.389
One more move and this one
goes straight into your heart.

09:16.390 --> 09:19.267
Just listen. The man you took
has something that belongs to me.

09:19.268 --> 09:20.852
I just want it back. That's all.

09:20.853 --> 09:22.186
We told you, he's dead.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.604
If he was dead,
you would've put his body there

09:23.605 --> 09:25.649
and you would've shot me
as soon as I got close.

09:26.650 --> 09:28.110
Look, we can trade.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.029
You set him free, and I'll let her go.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.615
We don't give a shit about her.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.704
I'm gonna leave. I need my stuff.

09:39.705 --> 09:42.832
So I need to see him.
I need to talk to him. He has my stu--

09:42.833 --> 09:45.169
You can talk to him
if you get us the food from his vault.

09:47.421 --> 09:49.338
- I don't know the code.
- Figure it out.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.507
What the fuck are you doing?

09:51.508 --> 09:53.759
What, are you just gonna let her
out of our sight?

09:53.760 --> 09:55.095
I'll go with her.

09:55.888 --> 09:57.471
Fine. Good.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.973
This is your fault anyway.

09:58.974 --> 10:00.934
If you try anything, we'll know.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.604
I just fed my baby

10:04.188 --> 10:06.105
and she won't cry again
until she's hungry.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.025
If you don't get into the vault
by the next time she cries...

10:09.026 --> 10:10.401
Okay.

10:10.402 --> 10:11.945
...we'll kill your friend.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.209
<i>We think we're the chosen ones...</i>

11:51.587 --> 11:54.882
but we're just one of many.

11:56.592 --> 11:58.719
The Founders didn't build a single silo.

11:59.303 --> 12:00.679
They built 50.

12:01.972 --> 12:03.432
Technically, 51.

12:04.975 --> 12:05.809
Why?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.269
Good question.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.937
I don't know.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.689
Could Juliette have made it
to another silo?

12:11.690 --> 12:15.360
She did. But then the images
from her helmet cut out.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.653
So she could still be alive?

12:17.654 --> 12:18.696
Unlikely.

12:18.697 --> 12:21.116
That silo is no longer functional.

12:21.867 --> 12:24.243
All IT heads and their shadows

12:24.244 --> 12:26.330
know about the other silos.

12:27.206 --> 12:30.667
That is not what Quinn
would need to put in code.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.087
Keep going.

12:41.178 --> 12:44.973
The day I found the book,
I knew I was supposed to destroy it.

12:47.059 --> 12:51.730
But there was something inside me,
it wouldn't let go.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.902
Why is it illegal for us to have this?

12:57.653 --> 12:58.862
I don't know.

13:00.656 --> 13:01.949
It's not right, Paul.

13:02.658 --> 13:05.494
Whatever happened, this was our world.

13:06.537 --> 13:10.958
We deserve to know where we came from,
no matter what the Pact says.

13:12.167 --> 13:15.170
I know that makes you uncomfortable...

13:18.465 --> 13:20.509
but I also know it's true.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.782
You know, you can't just
keep trying random numbers.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.200
- You only get three tries per day--
- I know.

13:46.201 --> 13:49.453
Look, if you know something that
actually would help me, then come with me.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.621
If not, just wait.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.915
Okay? It's not like I can sneak out
some other way, right?

13:52.916 --> 13:55.418
- You said you were going outside?
- Yeah, I've tried but every time I--

13:55.419 --> 13:56.712
Can I go with you?

13:58.005 --> 13:59.172
No, there's one suit.

13:59.173 --> 14:01.341
And if I don't get into the vault,
well, I'm--

14:01.967 --> 14:03.177
Let me help.

14:06.597 --> 14:07.764
You heard me, right? One suit.

14:09.308 --> 14:10.475
Okay, let's go.

14:22.696 --> 14:26.658
After Holston died, they came to me
about taking over as sheriff.

14:30.120 --> 14:31.914
I thought they saw a leader in me.

14:33.248 --> 14:35.125
Now I know that wasn't it.

14:36.251 --> 14:40.088
What they really saw was someone
they could count on to fall in line,

14:40.964 --> 14:42.424
to not ask questions.

14:43.050 --> 14:44.468
But they misjudged me.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.928
I have a lot of questions

14:46.929 --> 14:50.348
and I am not willing
to leave them unanswered.

14:50.349 --> 14:51.891
Not anymore.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.559
It was Juliette.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.978
She was the one who made me open my eyes,

14:55.979 --> 14:59.107
start to see it's time.

15:00.359 --> 15:02.611
The lies have to stop.

15:05.197 --> 15:07.740
Well, that was a good speech.

15:07.741 --> 15:10.911
But, what exactly can you do for us?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.120
You asked for my help.

15:13.121 --> 15:16.041
I didn't realize there was nothing
you could actually do.

15:17.334 --> 15:19.294
We have another traitor we have to find.

15:20.212 --> 15:21.712
Someone gave up the Supply raid.

15:21.713 --> 15:24.841
How can he help with that?
He doesn't know people down here.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.552
He knows people up top.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.889
Any way the other deputies
would line up with us?

15:32.391 --> 15:33.976
- I don't know.
- Why not?

15:34.476 --> 15:37.353
That's right, because all communication
was severed, thanks to you.

15:37.354 --> 15:38.771
- Shirl.
- Am I wrong?

15:38.772 --> 15:40.189
What was I supposed to do?

15:40.190 --> 15:42.400
Maybe not tell Bernard over the radio

15:42.401 --> 15:45.320
that you were gonna launch
an investigation into him and Sims.

15:53.245 --> 15:54.288
I'm sorry.

15:55.372 --> 15:58.458
It's just, we can't do this alone.

16:01.336 --> 16:03.213
But we don't know if anyone's on our side.

16:04.756 --> 16:06.008
There is one person.

16:07.301 --> 16:08.885
The woman who helped us get down.

16:08.886 --> 16:10.553
Yeah, I was thinking of her.

16:10.554 --> 16:12.639
But I don't see how we could contact her.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.933
Who are you talking about?

16:16.852 --> 16:18.061
Camille Sims.

16:49.301 --> 16:50.302
You read?

16:52.304 --> 16:53.554
Can you read?

16:53.555 --> 16:55.265
- Yeah.
- Okay, great.

16:55.766 --> 17:00.562
Can you look for anything
that says "Russell" or "head of IT" on it?

17:01.104 --> 17:03.147
If the code was just written down,
someone would've found it.

17:03.148 --> 17:05.399
Yeah, I don't know what else
to do right now.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.819
So if you could help me find anything,
that'll be great.

17:11.031 --> 17:12.240
Yeah.

17:12.241 --> 17:15.536
The people in the other room that died,
did you see them?

17:16.411 --> 17:17.286
Yeah.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.454
Tess was Rick's mom
and Chase was Audrey's dad,

17:19.455 --> 17:21.959
and they got together after
the other parents died and had Benny.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.670
When my mom got sick,
she brought me to them.

17:25.671 --> 17:28.297
She asked if they'd take me in.

17:28.298 --> 17:30.467
And they did, when she died.

17:33.345 --> 17:35.680
But I was kinda just...
I was just another mouth to feed.

17:35.681 --> 17:37.683
That's why they wanted
to get into the vault.

17:39.142 --> 17:40.269
That's why they died.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.604
We were hungry.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.609
The others, they blame me.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.071
That's why they call me Eater.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.031
That's all I am to them.

17:53.532 --> 17:55.366
Look, I understand.

17:55.367 --> 17:56.869
More than you know.

17:58.036 --> 18:00.706
- Okay? Just right now, I need--
- I know. We'll look for the code.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.960
I just wanted to tell you.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.060
Hey, what about this?

18:26.648 --> 18:29.150
- This--
- That's his apartment.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.528
- It's a different address.
- Is it something?

18:32.487 --> 18:33.739
We will see.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.118
Here's what you gotta know.

18:38.994 --> 18:41.997
Okay? That page that your husband has?

18:42.664 --> 18:43.998
That's nothing.

18:43.999 --> 18:46.125
I mean, you have no idea
what they're not telling us.

18:46.126 --> 18:47.586
What are they not telling us?

18:49.254 --> 18:51.507
You around a computer
when Nichols was caught?

18:52.424 --> 18:53.674
No.

18:53.675 --> 18:57.012
Well, if you had been, you'd have seen.

18:57.846 --> 18:59.681
You'd know what I'm talking about.

19:00.849 --> 19:04.061
You'd also be in a small room
with a bag over your head.

19:05.354 --> 19:06.355
Thanks.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.738
You remember
when the sheriff's wife cleaned?

19:16.156 --> 19:18.951
What she said
before she said she wanted to go out?

19:19.910 --> 19:21.953
"The display is a lie."

19:21.954 --> 19:23.247
Exactly.

19:26.041 --> 19:28.334
That page you saw?

19:28.335 --> 19:31.255
Maybe that's not just the way things were.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.340
Maybe--

19:35.342 --> 19:37.010
Maybe that's the way things are.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.118
Hey, have you seen Mayor Holland?

20:02.119 --> 20:03.035
No.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.371
Okay, well, I need to find him, like, now.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.123
- He's unreachable.
- What is that supposed to mean?

20:07.124 --> 20:08.542
It means you have to wait.

20:09.376 --> 20:12.044
Okay, listen.
You don't understand, all right?

20:12.045 --> 20:16.257
Look, the life of the Silo
depends on me finding him right now.

20:16.258 --> 20:17.967
You don't understand.

20:17.968 --> 20:20.637
Your life depends on you
letting go of my arm.

20:27.352 --> 20:29.938
I have orders not to disturb him
until this evening.

20:46.914 --> 20:47.998
Walk.

20:48.957 --> 20:51.126
- What do you want?
- Missed you at breakfast.

20:52.211 --> 20:53.377
Wasn't hungry.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.630
Shirl said that you weren't feeling good.

20:55.631 --> 20:57.131
That's bullshit.

20:57.132 --> 20:59.384
What she said was,
"Walk can't leave her workshop again."

21:00.010 --> 21:02.887
Ever since I got back,
I can't go near that door.

21:02.888 --> 21:06.642
I can't even think about it
without my heart jumping into my throat.

21:07.267 --> 21:09.852
I was wrong to think I could get over it.
I was stupid.

21:09.853 --> 21:11.104
It wasn't stupid.

21:12.856 --> 21:15.108
- Just takes time.
- Yeah. Well, there isn't any.

21:15.609 --> 21:17.194
They've got my wife.

21:17.861 --> 21:21.406
First time I lost her,
that's when this all started.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.326
It's not gonna go away.
Not if I don't get her back.

21:27.079 --> 21:28.288
Walk, look at me.

21:30.541 --> 21:31.708
Look at me.

21:33.418 --> 21:35.003
You're gonna get her back.

21:35.629 --> 21:36.964
How do you know?

21:37.798 --> 21:39.883
'Cause you missed something at breakfast.

21:41.802 --> 21:43.262
We have the sheriff now.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.472
He's with us.

21:46.723 --> 21:48.599
<i>We're gonna take control of the Silo.</i>

21:48.600 --> 21:50.394
<i>And the first thing we're gonna do</i>

21:51.270 --> 21:52.437
is free McLain.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.446
I just wanted you to know
that we have a plan.

22:11.832 --> 22:12.958
Get some rest.

22:43.780 --> 22:45.574
<i>You heard everything I did.</i>

22:54.458 --> 22:56.877
How do I know,
when you got me shackled to this room?

23:49.888 --> 23:50.931
Mom.

23:51.723 --> 23:53.724
Lukas, what's wrong?

23:53.725 --> 23:55.977
- Where have you been? Are you okay?
- Nothing's wrong, Mom.

23:55.978 --> 23:59.313
All I got was a note saying my son had
been sentenced to five years in the mines.

23:59.314 --> 24:00.815
Well, they released me.

24:00.816 --> 24:02.525
All right, look,
I can't explain all of that--

24:02.526 --> 24:05.194
- You've been free for how long?
- Not long. I couldn't get away.

24:05.195 --> 24:08.114
- To tell me you're safe?
- Just... Mom, I need you to take this.

24:08.115 --> 24:10.783
Hide it somewhere
no one can find it, okay?

24:10.784 --> 24:13.202
No, I won't. I thought I'd lost you.

24:13.203 --> 24:15.121
- You're putting your life at risk again?
- You don't understand.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.164
You were always this way,
even as a little boy.

24:17.165 --> 24:20.042
- I don't have a choice.
- There's peace in the unknown, Lukas.

24:20.043 --> 24:22.712
I wish you could find it,
but you're driven to solve things

24:22.713 --> 24:25.339
even when they can't be solved.
And now it's led you here, to whatever--

24:25.340 --> 24:27.009
No, what's led me here is being a coward.

24:29.887 --> 24:33.432
Sheriff Nichols came to me for help

24:35.058 --> 24:37.185
and I told her I couldn't give it to her

24:37.186 --> 24:40.438
because I was the only one
taking care of my mother.

24:40.439 --> 24:42.065
- What? But you don't--
- I lied.

24:45.235 --> 24:47.321
I lied to her, Mom,
to get out of doing the right thing.

24:48.113 --> 24:49.447
And I didn't help her.

24:49.448 --> 24:51.158
I didn't report her either. I just...

24:53.327 --> 24:54.494
did nothing.

24:57.456 --> 24:59.333
I'm not gonna make
that same mistake again.

25:06.465 --> 25:08.592
- Okay?
- Yeah.

25:10.177 --> 25:11.303
Hey.

25:12.679 --> 25:13.680
Thank you.

25:36.912 --> 25:38.539
Your Russell guy had a kid.

25:43.418 --> 25:45.629
Hey, what do you eat in your silo?

25:48.215 --> 25:49.715
It changes.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.009
Depends on what they have
in the cafeteria.

25:52.010 --> 25:53.762
So you never had to eat a rat?

25:56.974 --> 25:57.975
No.

26:24.751 --> 26:26.086
What is it?

26:28.088 --> 26:29.089
Nothing.

26:32.593 --> 26:37.597
So you said Chase and Tess,
they were trying to get into the vault.

26:37.598 --> 26:39.141
Yeah, but they never found the code.

26:39.641 --> 26:41.184
They gave up looking for it.

26:41.185 --> 26:43.604
They just kept trying new numbers.
I don't know how they kept track.

26:47.191 --> 26:48.358
What did you say?

26:51.153 --> 26:52.988
I don't know how they kept track.

26:54.781 --> 26:55.782
I do.

26:58.076 --> 26:59.827
- Shit.
- What?

26:59.828 --> 27:03.289
I drew that, but I didn't know
that the numbers were--

27:03.290 --> 27:05.708
Chase and Tess wrote these.
I know their handwriting.

27:05.709 --> 27:07.044
So they got in, right?

27:07.878 --> 27:09.421
Otherwise, he wouldn't have killed them.

27:10.047 --> 27:12.882
So it would have been here,
which I erased. That's great.

27:12.883 --> 27:15.844
Anyway, I think I can figure it out
with what I've got here.

27:17.846 --> 27:19.889
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight...

27:19.890 --> 27:21.642
Fifteen, 16, 17.

27:30.275 --> 27:33.987
So, nine, 29, 30, 31,

27:34.571 --> 27:38.241
32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37.

27:38.242 --> 27:39.493
Thirty-seven, 38.

27:44.873 --> 27:46.416
One, two, three, four.

27:48.418 --> 27:49.419
One, two.

27:50.379 --> 27:51.797
Zero, three.

28:02.683 --> 28:04.434
Why do these all have two names?

28:07.938 --> 28:12.359
Bobby Parsons, Lynn Montgomery,
Emily Ames.

28:14.486 --> 28:17.864
The first is your first name
and the second one's called your last.

28:17.865 --> 28:19.867
Do you have one? A last name.

28:20.409 --> 28:21.410
Yeah. Nichols.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.333
My mom only gave me one.

28:30.961 --> 28:32.254
Doesn't matter anymore.

28:35.215 --> 28:36.591
The baby will wake up soon.

28:36.592 --> 28:40.011
Okay, could you bring me a slate please?

28:40.012 --> 28:41.471
Eight, nine.

28:46.018 --> 28:48.394
- Nobody gets any further.
- The mayor sent me.

28:48.395 --> 28:50.605
You know, I'm his shadow.

28:50.606 --> 28:52.398
I have authorization to cross, so...

28:52.399 --> 28:54.734
Unless you wanna be reported
for obstructing my movement--

28:54.735 --> 28:56.527
It's not safe down there.

28:56.528 --> 28:57.987
Are you sure you wanna go?

28:57.988 --> 28:59.198
I'm sure.

29:17.799 --> 29:18.967
Make it quick.

29:23.013 --> 29:24.764
Hey! Grab him! Come here!

29:24.765 --> 29:26.891
- Okay, all right.
- All right, let's go.

29:26.892 --> 29:28.851
Look, I need to get to the bottom.

29:28.852 --> 29:30.603
They let this one through.

29:30.604 --> 29:32.564
- Who are you?
- I'm Lukas Kyle.

29:38.946 --> 29:40.404
What would someone from IT,

29:40.405 --> 29:43.115
with a blue ID no less,
be doing in the Down Deep?

29:43.116 --> 29:44.659
Who sent you?

29:44.660 --> 29:46.578
No one. I came on my own.

29:48.956 --> 29:50.957
- Take him back.
- No, hey, listen.

29:50.958 --> 29:53.668
You think I would be coming down here
in the middle of all of this

29:53.669 --> 29:55.045
if I didn't have to?

29:55.587 --> 29:58.799
Fuck. I am trying to save the Silo.

30:02.094 --> 30:05.388
If Mr. Blue ID continues
to be an asshole, pitch him over the side.

30:05.389 --> 30:06.597
Fuck, stop!

30:06.598 --> 30:10.519
Just... Wait, I knew Juliette Nichols.

30:12.646 --> 30:13.981
Like hell you did.

30:14.606 --> 30:16.775
Her boyfriend's name was George.

30:19.361 --> 30:21.320
<i>As the senior members of your department,</i>

30:21.321 --> 30:25.533
I wanted to brief you
on the rebels' latest assault,

30:25.534 --> 30:26.951
which I'm sure you're aware of.

30:26.952 --> 30:28.244
We are, sir.

30:28.245 --> 30:31.706
Their intention was to steal gunpowder
from Supply

30:31.707 --> 30:34.125
and use it to blast open the silo door.

30:34.126 --> 30:36.670
We were able to stop their reckless plan,

30:37.254 --> 30:39.923
a plan we've since realized

30:41.675 --> 30:44.302
was put into motion by Paul Billings.

30:44.303 --> 30:45.636
How do we know that?

30:45.637 --> 30:48.681
The rebels in custody all identified him
as responsible.

30:48.682 --> 30:53.561
As such, we've decided
to strip Billings of his badge

30:53.562 --> 30:56.189
and leave the post vacant
until further notice.

30:56.190 --> 30:57.356
One last thing,

30:57.357 --> 30:59.233
all deputies and their support staff

30:59.234 --> 31:01.570
are being assigned
to the cafeteria on this level.

31:02.196 --> 31:04.864
We need to convert it
into a temporary holding cell.

31:04.865 --> 31:06.282
You want us to build a jail?

31:06.283 --> 31:10.786
You told us that we wouldn't have to do
anything related to the rebellion.

31:10.787 --> 31:13.415
Unfortunately, circumstances have changed.

31:21.340 --> 31:22.173
Shit.

31:22.174 --> 31:24.675
- There's still one left.
- Yeah, I know.

31:24.676 --> 31:27.762
But if I get it wrong, then we're locked
out for 24 hours...

31:27.763 --> 31:29.055
and Solo will fucking die.

31:29.056 --> 31:31.349
- So...
- That's his name? Solo?

31:31.350 --> 31:32.934
- Why?
- I don't know.

31:32.935 --> 31:34.560
Is it his first or second name?

31:34.561 --> 31:37.147
No, it's just not his name at all.

31:39.107 --> 31:40.399
<i>That's Solo.</i>

31:40.400 --> 31:41.692
<i>That's not you.</i>

31:41.693 --> 31:43.402
<i>That is the actual IT shadow.</i>

31:43.403 --> 31:44.904
<i>I don't know who you are.</i>

31:44.905 --> 31:46.906
I am the IT shadow.

31:46.907 --> 31:48.534
Do you understand?

31:49.785 --> 31:52.995
Do not say those words to me!
Don't you ever!

31:52.996 --> 31:55.331
Do you understand? I am Solo.

31:55.332 --> 31:57.751
<i>I am the IT shadow!</i>

31:59.753 --> 32:02.965
He's not who he says he is.

32:03.924 --> 32:05.676
She used to sit next to me.

32:06.426 --> 32:10.513
She said that her name
meant blue or something.

32:10.514 --> 32:13.350
Solo? This is a Level B classroom?

32:14.059 --> 32:18.772
So she would've been 11 or 12
when the rebellion started.

32:20.274 --> 32:21.984
So, how were you sitting next to her?

32:24.403 --> 32:29.198
Well, I didn't say
that this belonged to her.

32:29.199 --> 32:31.285
It's just that it reminded me of her.

32:31.869 --> 32:32.910
<i>The rebellion...</i>

32:32.911 --> 32:34.663
how old were you when that happened?

32:35.372 --> 32:38.000
I wasn't born yet.

32:39.626 --> 32:42.296
My mom didn't even remember.
She was just a baby then.

32:47.968 --> 32:49.303
Oh, fuck.

32:53.891 --> 32:55.684
He was just a kid.

33:01.315 --> 33:02.691
That was Solo's classroom.

33:09.615 --> 33:10.823
Conroy.

33:10.824 --> 33:12.576
That's Russell's last name.

33:13.076 --> 33:15.078
In the apartment. The lunch box.

33:20.459 --> 33:21.502
Hey.

33:23.212 --> 33:24.213
That's him.

33:24.713 --> 33:28.049
If you're the one in charge,
I need you to let me go.

33:28.050 --> 33:29.343
How did you know Jules?

33:29.927 --> 33:33.721
We used to talk in the cafeteria,
when she was leaving work, okay?

33:33.722 --> 33:35.390
Then you didn't really know her.

33:36.517 --> 33:38.643
I know that she was searching
for the truth.

33:38.644 --> 33:39.894
So am I.

33:39.895 --> 33:41.395
That's what brought me down here.

33:41.396 --> 33:43.981
Sounds like something
your boss would tell you to say.

33:43.982 --> 33:46.360
Hey, wait. I think Juliette
could still be alive.

33:56.662 --> 33:57.704
Where?

33:58.622 --> 34:00.040
I'll tell you.

34:01.750 --> 34:03.877
But only if you take me
where I need to go.

34:11.051 --> 34:13.218
I've got no idea who it could be.

34:13.219 --> 34:15.888
Bernard got a tip-off on the raid
from someone.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.138
Another listener?

34:17.139 --> 34:18.474
Could be.

34:18.475 --> 34:20.267
How'd they get a message to Bernard?

34:20.268 --> 34:22.227
There's no computers, no porters.

34:22.228 --> 34:24.437
Maybe they passed a piece of paper
to one of the raiders.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.691
- I mean, that's what you did.
- Yeah, but I have no idea

34:26.692 --> 34:28.819
if that message got where I want it to go.

34:29.319 --> 34:32.571
Sheriff, they're asking for you
at the barricade.

34:32.572 --> 34:34.448
Someone to see you.

34:34.449 --> 34:36.075
Looks like your message got through.

34:36.076 --> 34:38.745
You want us to come with you?
A show of strength?

34:40.496 --> 34:41.581
Better if it's just me.

34:46.837 --> 34:48.755
Getting a message through the barricade.

34:52.551 --> 34:54.052
What? What is it?

34:57.054 --> 34:58.557
I know who betrayed us.

35:06.315 --> 35:08.733
- Wa... Hey. You get in?
- No.

35:08.734 --> 35:12.320
- Hey, you need to let me talk to him.
- No, that wasn't the deal.

35:12.321 --> 35:13.821
Okay.

35:13.822 --> 35:16.115
Look, your parents,
they figured out the code, right?

35:16.116 --> 35:18.451
I've narrowed it down to six combinations.

35:18.452 --> 35:20.286
I get three chances a day.

35:20.287 --> 35:22.747
I've tried two,
so the only way I can get in

35:22.748 --> 35:25.208
- is if you let me talk to him.
- No, you don't get to see him.

35:25.209 --> 35:28.169
If you let her kill him,
you'll never get in.

35:28.170 --> 35:30.505
- You need to open the vault!
- No, I don't.

35:30.506 --> 35:33.300
I don't need to,
I could just leave, right?

35:33.800 --> 35:36.093
I don't need
to get into the fucking vault. You do.

35:36.094 --> 35:37.638
- You need to get int--
- Wait, wait.

35:46.396 --> 35:47.564
That's my mom's.

35:49.316 --> 35:50.567
Where did you get that?

35:51.235 --> 35:54.696
Her talking to him is the best shot
we have at getting into the vault.

36:34.403 --> 36:35.404
Hey.

36:36.780 --> 36:38.031
Hey.

36:39.575 --> 36:40.826
Hey, are you okay?

36:42.202 --> 36:43.495
Shit.

36:46.498 --> 36:48.166
- I failed.
- What?

36:49.001 --> 36:51.002
No. No... You didn't--

36:51.003 --> 36:52.170
- He told me...
- What do you mean?

36:52.171 --> 36:54.380
...not to let anyone in the vault.

36:54.381 --> 36:57.926
Well, I didn't get in.
No one's been in the vault.

37:00.137 --> 37:01.513
Then what are you doing here?

37:02.181 --> 37:06.017
Look, I understand how important it is
to protect the vault.

37:06.018 --> 37:07.102
I do.

37:08.020 --> 37:09.104
I get it.

37:10.647 --> 37:13.983
I promise you, if you give me the code--

37:13.984 --> 37:16.236
- I won't. I--
- No, please. Just listen.

37:16.820 --> 37:20.199
I'll go in, I'll get food.
That's all they want.

37:20.908 --> 37:23.826
I could... I want to go back to my silo.

37:23.827 --> 37:26.913
No. Just... You might as well
let them come in here and kill me now.

37:26.914 --> 37:29.457
No, just think about it please.

37:29.458 --> 37:32.210
- Russell chose me to be his shadow.
- No.

37:32.211 --> 37:34.670
I am the only one left
to keep the vault safe.

37:34.671 --> 37:36.047
You were never his shadow.

37:36.048 --> 37:37.841
- I swore an oath.
- No.

37:40.052 --> 37:42.346
But you weren't his shadow.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.310
You were his son.

38:00.113 --> 38:03.784
Benny, I told you to use the ladder.

38:04.284 --> 38:05.953
I will. Next time.

38:14.670 --> 38:15.921
I'll be right back.

38:16.505 --> 38:18.131
Are you gonna kill him now?

38:26.723 --> 38:29.017
Hey, do you remember?

38:30.644 --> 38:32.271
I've never seen this before.

38:32.938 --> 38:34.814
- I know you don't want to try but I--
- Get out!

38:34.815 --> 38:36.607
- Hey, no. No, just wait.
- Just--

38:36.608 --> 38:37.942
- Fine.
- Stop, please.

38:37.943 --> 38:39.527
I have more arrows.

38:39.528 --> 38:40.904
Audrey, wait.

38:42.906 --> 38:44.408
You're taking their side?

38:47.202 --> 38:48.704
I wanna hear what he has to say.

38:49.371 --> 38:50.414
Just put it down.

38:56.128 --> 38:57.670
Okay, okay.

38:57.671 --> 38:59.506
Tell us how you killed our parents.

39:01.133 --> 39:04.135
- What happened?
- He asked me to do one thing

39:04.136 --> 39:06.596
- and I failed.
- What do you mean you failed?

39:06.597 --> 39:09.849
They got in. They got the right code
and they got in.

39:09.850 --> 39:14.937
And I was right there.
I was right there and I did nothing.

39:14.938 --> 39:16.856
Even after they came in, I didn't wake up.

39:16.857 --> 39:18.149
- I did--
- You were asleep?

39:18.150 --> 39:19.735
I didn't... I did... I--

39:20.819 --> 39:22.404
I didn't wake up until...

39:25.032 --> 39:27.116
It's okay. Until what? What?

39:27.117 --> 39:29.368
It was very loud.

39:29.369 --> 39:30.453
What was loud?

39:30.454 --> 39:34.749
I'm so fucking stupid.
I left the gun by the door.

39:34.750 --> 39:37.043
Did they shoot you while you were asleep?

39:37.044 --> 39:38.837
- Is that what happened?
- You can't believe him.

39:41.215 --> 39:43.008
- Rick.
- Then what?

39:44.134 --> 39:45.718
He killed our parents.

39:45.719 --> 39:48.513
- I didn't want to.
- But you did!

39:48.514 --> 39:50.557
They got inside the food vault.

39:51.517 --> 39:52.601
So...

39:54.394 --> 39:57.021
I broke off the inside handle
of the door and I shut it,

39:57.022 --> 40:01.776
and they couldn't get out
'cause it was sealed.

40:01.777 --> 40:03.529
So they ran out of air?

40:08.408 --> 40:10.369
It doesn't matter how he did it.

40:11.370 --> 40:13.996
He killed them and he's lying
about them shooting him.

40:13.997 --> 40:15.832
Do you have a scar?

40:17.584 --> 40:19.502
Yeah? I know you don't want to show them

40:19.503 --> 40:21.587
but they need to know
you're telling the truth.

40:21.588 --> 40:23.966
- I'm not lying.
- Can I just--

40:24.675 --> 40:25.843
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:29.930 --> 40:30.931
Okay.

40:33.976 --> 40:36.228
Are you gonna give us the code or not?

40:40.023 --> 40:41.108
Fine.

40:41.900 --> 40:43.110
How about this?

40:43.819 --> 40:46.196
We'll figure it out
eventually ourselves, right?

40:46.697 --> 40:47.906
So we don't need him.

40:50.325 --> 40:52.410
One less eater.

40:52.411 --> 40:54.245
Your name's Jimmy Conroy.

40:54.246 --> 40:57.081
- Move. I said move!
- And you were 12 when the rebellion--

40:57.082 --> 40:59.835
You were 12--
Stop! Stop, please. Just listen.

41:00.460 --> 41:04.213
He was 12, okay,
when the rebellion happened. Twelve.

41:04.214 --> 41:07.842
He wasn't old enough to be able
to be responsible for all of this.

41:07.843 --> 41:09.219
You were 12.

41:09.887 --> 41:11.220
Jimmy was a coward.

41:11.221 --> 41:14.098
- No.
- Jimmy hid behind a door...

41:14.099 --> 41:15.183
Open the damn door, Jimmy!

41:15.184 --> 41:18.312
...<i>while the sheriff held a gun
to his father's head.</i>

41:19.479 --> 41:22.107
<i>All he had to do was open the door
and he didn't. So--</i>

41:26.653 --> 41:27.987
Dad.

41:27.988 --> 41:30.239
<i>Does that sound
like the son of a hero to you?</i>

41:30.240 --> 41:32.575
<i>Russell would've been ashamed
to have a son like that.</i>

41:32.576 --> 41:34.744
<i>No, you're wrong.
He would've been so proud</i>

41:34.745 --> 41:36.662
<i>'cause you did what he asked you to do.</i>

41:36.663 --> 41:38.748
<i>"Don't open the door.
Don't let anyone in."</i>

41:38.749 --> 41:40.458
- <i>That's what he said to you, right?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

41:40.459 --> 41:42.251
<i>Yeah, do you know why he said that?</i>

41:42.252 --> 41:45.546
<i>'Cause he wanted to save the vault.
Because he wanted to save the Silo.</i>

41:45.547 --> 41:46.964
<i>No. No, Jimmy.</i>

41:46.965 --> 41:48.842
He wanted to save you.

41:49.843 --> 41:51.719
He wanted you to live.

41:51.720 --> 41:55.182
Come... Just like their parents
wanted them to live.

41:55.933 --> 41:59.353
That's why your father was protecting you.

42:00.812 --> 42:04.274
Just like they want their child to live.
Okay?

42:05.108 --> 42:06.318
They have a kid?

42:07.736 --> 42:09.321
They have a baby.

42:11.740 --> 42:12.866
A baby.

42:16.203 --> 42:17.871
- It's okay.
- Rick.

42:19.039 --> 42:21.415
- It's okay.
- I need to do it.

42:21.416 --> 42:22.751
It's okay.

42:29.341 --> 42:30.384
Okay.

42:32.386 --> 42:33.387
Yeah?

42:35.180 --> 42:36.807
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

42:52.030 --> 42:53.322
You got my message?

42:53.323 --> 42:56.660
No, Paul, I just decided
to walk down a hundred levels.

42:57.995 --> 42:59.162
Where's the relic?

42:59.663 --> 43:00.705
We need privacy.

43:00.706 --> 43:03.333
On the stairs,
in the middle of a rebellion?

43:15.554 --> 43:16.930
So it's true.

43:18.348 --> 43:20.308
You really have crossed the line.

43:20.309 --> 43:21.976
Gone over to the other side.

43:21.977 --> 43:23.437
I didn't go anywhere.

43:24.813 --> 43:26.481
The line moved.

43:27.524 --> 43:28.901
Let me see it.

43:39.620 --> 43:40.995
It's not safe to open here.

43:40.996 --> 43:45.291
You made me come all this way
'cause I'm the only one you could trust.

43:45.292 --> 43:48.086
- Come on, we both know that's a lie.
- You're right.

43:49.588 --> 43:51.340
I wanted to see your wife.

43:52.341 --> 43:55.427
But all I had for bait was this relic,
so it had to be you.

43:56.720 --> 44:00.599
She helped two rebels escape capture
when they were on the run,

44:01.391 --> 44:04.977
which makes me wonder if maybe
some of us care more

44:04.978 --> 44:07.981
about the safety of the Silo
than anything else.

44:12.152 --> 44:13.362
When you see this...

44:15.697 --> 44:19.243
you'll understand why
I don't have any choice but to trust you.

44:23.121 --> 44:24.289
To do what?

44:49.815 --> 44:52.109
I haven't been down this far in years.

44:54.528 --> 44:56.697
Jules hinted this is where
she came with George.

44:59.700 --> 45:01.577
You were right, you know. I--

45:03.662 --> 45:05.121
I didn't really know her.

45:05.122 --> 45:09.750
We only talked a few times and...
I never met anyone like her.

45:09.751 --> 45:11.253
There isn't anyone like her.

45:13.130 --> 45:14.131
Yeah.

45:16.800 --> 45:18.177
I thought she was amazing.

45:22.431 --> 45:27.101
So amazing that I tried to kiss her.

45:27.102 --> 45:28.353
And you're still alive?

45:29.313 --> 45:30.647
You're lucky.

45:32.983 --> 45:34.817
I didn't know about George.

45:34.818 --> 45:36.528
Not until later.

45:38.071 --> 45:39.197
I just--

45:39.198 --> 45:42.910
I wish I would've done something more
to help her.

45:47.080 --> 45:48.165
We all do.

45:54.379 --> 45:55.379
Yeah.

45:55.380 --> 45:57.173
I've been coming down here for years.

45:57.174 --> 45:59.176
I've never heard anything about a tunnel.

45:59.760 --> 46:00.886
You're sure it's down there?

46:04.723 --> 46:06.058
Yeah, that's what I was told.

46:08.810 --> 46:10.145
Then you were lied to.

46:12.356 --> 46:14.066
The only thing at the bottom is water.

46:18.737 --> 46:20.239
I don't think it's that deep.

46:21.323 --> 46:22.532
Right? Think about it.

46:22.533 --> 46:26.495
This whole space should be filled
with water, but it's not.

46:27.746 --> 46:29.373
So, what?

46:31.208 --> 46:33.585
You're saying there's pumps down there

46:34.962 --> 46:36.420
that Mechanical doesn't know about?

46:36.421 --> 46:37.589
There have to be.

46:40.926 --> 46:42.594
You willing to bet your life on that?

46:55.566 --> 46:56.567
Yes.

47:03.282 --> 47:04.533
Yeah, I'm coming.

47:10.998 --> 47:12.791
Since when do you have to knock?

47:14.376 --> 47:15.919
I thought you'd want to know.

47:16.503 --> 47:18.422
<i>I figured out who the traitor is.</i>

47:30.267 --> 47:31.393
It's Teddy's mom.

47:37.983 --> 47:40.651
<i>I saw her yesterday
before the raid on Supply.</i>

47:40.652 --> 47:41.862
<i>She was at the barricade.</i>

47:42.613 --> 47:44.448
I think she was just afraid...

47:46.783 --> 47:48.368
that Teddy would be killed.

47:49.411 --> 47:50.828
Did you talk to her?

47:50.829 --> 47:51.997
Not yet.

47:54.249 --> 47:55.542
Can't punish her.

47:56.210 --> 47:58.504
Not for trying to protect her son.

48:05.219 --> 48:06.762
But we're in a jam now, Walk.

48:08.514 --> 48:10.390
<i>What we're doing, it's not working.</i>

48:11.266 --> 48:12.809
<i>We gotta change the game.</i>

48:13.393 --> 48:14.770
<i>Why are you telling me?</i>

48:16.355 --> 48:18.899
<i>I couldn't find Shirl
and needed someone to run it by.</i>

48:20.817 --> 48:22.110
<i>I'm all ears.</i>

48:25.405 --> 48:28.242
You know the rest of the gunpowder
we took from Supply?

48:31.286 --> 48:32.371
We're gonna use it.

49:23.130 --> 49:24.214
You just... You know--

49:28.093 --> 49:29.386
This is--

49:30.596 --> 49:31.597
This is--

49:32.681 --> 49:34.808
It's a boat I've been working on.

49:35.893 --> 49:36.894
It's a sailboat.

49:38.729 --> 49:41.314
You know, I was gonna heat up some food,

49:41.315 --> 49:45.819
but I think maybe we should start
with something else.

49:50.240 --> 49:51.241
Ice cream.

50:04.379 --> 50:07.049
- Wait, wait.
- No, it's okay. You can go in.

50:12.095 --> 50:13.263
This is it.

50:41.208 --> 50:42.209
Yeah, let's...

50:43.919 --> 50:45.003
Just leave--

50:46.588 --> 50:47.798
Hey.

50:48.549 --> 50:50.092
Okay. It's okay.

50:50.968 --> 50:52.469
They're drums. You play 'em.

50:57.975 --> 50:59.141
Yeah.

50:59.142 --> 51:00.811
- Like that?
- Yep.

51:11.572 --> 51:12.573
Wow.

51:24.251 --> 51:25.294
Birds.

51:33.177 --> 51:35.345
Hey, you guys wanna hear some music?

51:36.096 --> 51:37.097
What's that?

51:38.098 --> 51:39.808
It's music. It--

51:42.936 --> 51:45.898
I actually think it's better
than ice cream.

51:51.612 --> 51:52.988
I kept it safe.

52:18.138 --> 52:19.139
Thanks.

52:20.891 --> 52:24.853
This isn't the only suit though.

52:27.356 --> 52:29.608
There's one
you didn't tell me about, right?

52:32.194 --> 52:35.613
<i>The head of IT gets a suit,
in case the air lock is breached</i>

52:35.614 --> 52:38.741
<i>and they need to safely get back
to the vault.</i>

52:38.742 --> 52:40.243
- What is it?
- Nothing.

52:40.244 --> 52:42.662
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you about it.

52:42.663 --> 52:45.457
That's fine. I almost drowned and...

52:46.416 --> 52:48.961
got shot with an arrow.

52:57.261 --> 52:58.762
I don't understand that.

53:01.265 --> 53:04.852
If you found a suit,
why didn't you just leave?

53:29.001 --> 53:30.085
You ready?

53:30.669 --> 53:31.753
Yeah.

53:41.388 --> 53:42.389
You okay?

53:44.641 --> 53:45.850
Yeah.

53:45.851 --> 53:48.519
- Wait.
- What?

53:48.520 --> 53:50.189
Tell me what happened to Jules.

53:52.691 --> 53:53.692
In case I die?

53:55.194 --> 53:56.360
Well, yeah.

53:56.361 --> 53:57.613
Right.

53:58.780 --> 54:02.408
Right. There was a camera
in her cleaning helmet.

54:02.409 --> 54:05.786
And when it stopped working,
she was still alive.

54:05.787 --> 54:07.663
- What?
- Yeah.

54:07.664 --> 54:08.916
Did you see her?

54:09.458 --> 54:11.251
No, it's what I was told.

54:13.545 --> 54:15.171
Does that mean she's still out there?

54:15.172 --> 54:16.506
I don't know. I--

54:16.507 --> 54:18.926
If I knew, I would tell you.

54:19.968 --> 54:21.220
But I hope so.

54:25.766 --> 54:28.519
Right. Wish me luck.

54:30.229 --> 54:31.522
You're gonna need it.

54:32.523 --> 54:33.815
'Cause you're on your own.

54:35.859 --> 54:36.902
Great.

55:00.509 --> 55:01.927
Do you think it's real?

55:04.763 --> 55:05.931
I don't know.

55:08.892 --> 55:12.019
- It's time for us to pick a side.
- You think they'll win?

55:12.020 --> 55:14.773
They might,
if you do what Paul Billings asked.

55:15.566 --> 55:18.776
Rob, if they do win,
they'll need someone to run the Silo.

55:18.777 --> 55:20.070
That could be you.

55:21.113 --> 55:23.323
This is what we need to do.

55:23.991 --> 55:25.075
For Anthony.

55:27.286 --> 55:28.286
I can't do it.

55:28.287 --> 55:30.162
They see me as the enemy.

55:30.163 --> 55:31.540
Okay.

55:36.044 --> 55:37.212
Okay, I'll do it.

55:41.258 --> 55:43.135
There is something else I can do.

55:43.760 --> 55:45.095
Bernard has a key.

55:45.721 --> 55:47.055
Number 18 on it.

55:47.598 --> 55:49.140
And when things go sideways,

55:49.141 --> 55:52.560
it lights up and buzzes,
and he disappears.

55:52.561 --> 55:56.355
It happened when we got word
Mayor Jahns picked Nichols to be Sheriff.

55:56.356 --> 55:58.734
He took off. I followed him.

55:59.401 --> 56:02.361
He used the key to go through the door
into the Server Room.

56:02.362 --> 56:05.115
When he returned,
he told me he had to become Mayor.

56:06.742 --> 56:08.451
What's in the Server Room?

56:08.452 --> 56:10.286
Besides servers.

56:10.287 --> 56:11.371
I don't know.

56:12.748 --> 56:16.502
The only person with access
is the head of IT

56:17.461 --> 56:19.254
or whoever has the key.

58:10.866 --> 58:12.284
<i>Lukas Kyle.</i>

58:14.077 --> 58:15.412
<i>Why are you here?</i>

58:16.788 --> 58:18.624
I was given instructions.

58:19.708 --> 58:20.876
<i>By whom?</i>

58:21.960 --> 58:23.504
Salvador Quinn.

58:26.465 --> 58:29.426
<i>Before you,
only three people have reached this door:</i>

58:30.594 --> 58:34.932
<i>Salvador Quinn, Mary Meadows,
and George Wilkins.</i>

58:36.517 --> 58:38.185
<i>I did not speak with Wilkins.</i>

58:38.894 --> 58:42.523
<i>Quinn and Meadows were both given
the same directive you will now receive.</i>

58:43.357 --> 58:45.859
<i>If you speak to anyone
about this conversation</i>

58:46.360 --> 58:48.277
<i>or what you have seen down here,</i>

58:48.278 --> 58:51.323
<i>we will have no choice
but to initiate the Safeguard.</i>

58:52.783 --> 58:55.118
<i>Do you know
what the Safeguard is, Mr. Kyle?</i>

58:57.246 --> 58:58.288
I do.
