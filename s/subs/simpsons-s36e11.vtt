You will be housed
here in wine jail

20:39.555 --> 20:42.131
while you await your trial
in Springfield wine court.

20:42.149 --> 20:43.299
Wine court?

20:43.317 --> 20:45.892
Yes. Wine crimes
are too sophisticated

20:45.970 --> 20:47.970
for the undeveloped
legal palate

20:47.972 --> 20:49.321
of the American system.

20:49.323 --> 20:52.975
She sold a champagne
that was actually a prosecco.

20:52.977 --> 20:55.586
He called his wine
a Beaujolais nouveau

20:55.588 --> 20:57.329
but there was nothing
nouveau about it.

20:57.482 --> 21:00.499
And he's in solitary
for his own protection.

21:00.576 --> 21:02.001
We don't take kindly

21:02.077 --> 21:04.169
to oenophiles here.

21:04.171 --> 21:06.989
And here is where we house
our worst offenders:

21:06.991 --> 21:08.491
wine counterfeiters.

21:08.493 --> 21:11.585
Come back later
to try our toilet wine!

21:11.587 --> 21:15.231
We are trying to recreate
a 1974 San Quentin.
