WEBVTT

00:50.375 --> 00:52.958
Well, that's the last of it.

00:53.666 --> 00:55.500
Go catch something big to eat.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.958
You got it, Wrecker.

00:56.958 --> 00:58.583
Thanks for the help, Crosshair.

01:04.625 --> 01:08.166
Aw, look at that. You made a new friend.

01:08.750 --> 01:12.291
I checked the ship's comms.
Still no word from Fennec.

01:12.291 --> 01:15.333
Since when do we wait around for intel?

01:15.333 --> 01:17.291
Well, she's the only lead we have.

01:17.291 --> 01:20.208
If her contact can tell us
what an M-count is,

01:20.208 --> 01:23.541
we might figure out
why the Empire's targeting Omega.

01:23.541 --> 01:27.000
Does it matter?
We're not handing her over.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.791
Can't be prepared if we don't know
what we're dealing with.

01:45.708 --> 01:47.708
Batcher, wait!

02:02.625 --> 02:04.333
Batcher?

02:04.333 --> 02:06.166
What is it? What's wrong?

02:10.916 --> 02:15.458
It's just the cavern.
We've been in there plenty of times.

02:15.458 --> 02:19.291
Okay, okay. I'll check it out.

02:40.541 --> 02:42.583
Where did that come from?

02:57.916 --> 02:59.458
Batcher, where are you going?

03:09.083 --> 03:10.375
Hunter.

03:14.833 --> 03:15.875
Where's Omega?

03:22.333 --> 03:24.708
I wasn't doing anything. Let go!

03:24.708 --> 03:25.833
Hey!

03:29.291 --> 03:30.291
You heard her.

03:31.000 --> 03:32.208
Let her go.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.500
Gladly.

03:35.833 --> 03:39.916
You know, for rogue clones
who are trying to lay low,

03:39.916 --> 03:42.125
you're failing spectacularly.

03:42.708 --> 03:44.208
Especially that one.

03:44.791 --> 03:47.041
And who are you?

03:48.083 --> 03:49.208
Fennec sent me.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.833
We never gave her our coordinates.
How'd you find us?

03:55.541 --> 03:57.166
I have my ways.

03:58.500 --> 04:02.125
I hear you've been asking questions
about M-count.

04:03.041 --> 04:06.666
Very reckless to inquire
about such things.

04:06.666 --> 04:09.291
It attracts the wrong kind of attention.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.166
And why is that?

04:11.166 --> 04:13.958
That's the real question, isn't it?

04:15.916 --> 04:19.458
First, tell me
why you want this information.

04:21.375 --> 04:23.625
Consider it my payment.

04:24.125 --> 04:26.500
We already paid Fennec for the intel.

04:27.125 --> 04:28.500
Not my problem.

04:29.541 --> 04:31.416
Either talk or I go.

04:34.583 --> 04:35.916
It's for a friend.

04:38.125 --> 04:41.750
The Empire's after her, and she thinks

04:41.750 --> 04:45.250
it's because of some M-count
experiment they're doing.

04:45.250 --> 04:48.083
But we don't know what that means.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.625
It's something in the blood.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.708
Everyone has it, but at varying levels.

04:55.583 --> 04:57.333
Those with a high count

04:57.333 --> 05:02.083
were believed to be more
capable of wielding the Force.

05:02.083 --> 05:03.500
The Force?

05:03.500 --> 05:06.291
You mean Jedi.

05:06.791 --> 05:10.000
You're saying I'm a Jedi? Uh, I-I mean--

05:10.000 --> 05:11.375
Of course not.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.333
Your blood doesn't make you a Jedi.

05:15.041 --> 05:16.833
You'd have to be trained for that.

05:17.541 --> 05:21.166
And I've never known a clone
to be Force-sensitive.

05:21.166 --> 05:24.750
But clearly, none of you are normal.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.208
You got that right.

05:26.875 --> 05:31.333
The Kaminoans did make millions of you.
So I suppose it's possible.

05:32.083 --> 05:37.208
But if you do have a high M-count,
consider yourself warned.

05:37.208 --> 05:40.208
The Empire will hunt you down.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.000
There's your intel.

05:46.958 --> 05:47.958
Wait!

05:49.125 --> 05:50.375
Move, child.

05:50.958 --> 05:53.750
So is that why the Empire's been after me?

05:54.416 --> 05:58.083
I can't determine your midi-chlorian
levels without testing you.

05:58.083 --> 06:00.625
Well, then test me. I can handle it.

06:01.791 --> 06:05.708
Believe me,
the truth is rarely comforting.

06:07.083 --> 06:10.458
Please. No one's been able
to give me answers.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.875
I need to know what I am.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.291
Fine.

06:18.583 --> 06:22.583
But just remember, you asked for this.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.458
This is the test?

06:37.208 --> 06:38.208
One of them.

06:38.750 --> 06:41.500
But the rock is... [grunts] ...slippery.

06:42.291 --> 06:43.708
Can we go someplace else?

06:46.041 --> 06:49.958
How does standing on one leg
have anything to do with M-count?

06:50.750 --> 06:55.541
You're focused on the wrong things.
Stop trying to have balance.

06:55.541 --> 06:58.125
Let go of your conscious mind.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.625
"Conscious mind"?
I don't even know what that means.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.791
Whoa!

07:06.333 --> 07:08.000
Try again.

07:09.416 --> 07:12.166
Come on, Omega! You can do it!

07:13.416 --> 07:16.125
Why don't you two make yourselves scarce?

07:16.125 --> 07:20.250
She doesn't leave our sight.
And neither do you.

07:20.250 --> 07:22.333
How fun for me.

07:24.583 --> 07:25.625
Again.

07:26.750 --> 07:30.833
Since you know about these tests,
you must be a Jedi, right?

07:31.500 --> 07:35.208
No, but I know
some of their ways.

07:35.208 --> 07:39.500
But how do you--
Enough questions. Concentrate.

07:58.375 --> 08:01.250
I checked Tech's files
from the Republic archives.

08:01.958 --> 08:04.208
You were right. It's her.

08:04.708 --> 08:06.125
Asajj Ventress.

08:08.583 --> 08:11.375
Why would a Separatist assassin
be helping us?

08:11.375 --> 08:13.875
Who says that's what she's doing?

08:20.583 --> 08:22.416
Well? What happened?

08:22.416 --> 08:23.875
I told you.

08:24.791 --> 08:26.083
It's too slippery.

08:30.083 --> 08:31.666
I'll start over.

08:33.708 --> 08:34.708
No need.

08:35.541 --> 08:38.166
We're moving on to the next test.

08:38.958 --> 08:42.208
There's a weeping maya tree
up in the colonnade.

08:42.208 --> 08:46.875
Retrieve one of its white blossoms
and return before the sun sets.

08:46.875 --> 08:51.125
It's too far away.
And-- Well, the sun's already started s--

09:00.583 --> 09:05.250
Now that she's gone,
let me give you some advice.

09:05.875 --> 09:10.708
Whatever you're planning on doing
won't end well for you.

09:18.166 --> 09:22.291
Think carefully.
How do you want this to go?

09:29.083 --> 09:31.791
Sorry. Excuse me.
Coming through. Watch out.

09:49.833 --> 09:52.333
Hey, girl.
I'm gonna need some help.

09:52.333 --> 09:54.750
I need to get to the Archium, and fast.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.291
Okay, let's go.

09:58.875 --> 10:02.125
You asked me for my help. Remember?

10:02.666 --> 10:05.083
That's before we realized who you are.

10:05.791 --> 10:07.000
Now leave.

10:07.833 --> 10:13.333
I'll consider it, once I've finished
testing Omega's abilities.

10:17.583 --> 10:21.958
Or maybe I'll stick around
here a bit longer.

10:21.958 --> 10:26.791
Wrong. Get in your ship and go.
Before we make you.

10:26.791 --> 10:28.791
You can try.

10:28.791 --> 10:30.916
We've taken down worse.

10:30.916 --> 10:32.833
So have I.

10:36.208 --> 10:38.250
No cheating.

10:50.291 --> 10:52.250
Ha!

10:56.208 --> 10:57.333
Ow!

11:35.416 --> 11:36.666
Tired yet?

11:40.416 --> 11:42.833
What do you really want with Omega?

11:42.833 --> 11:45.208
Maybe I'll take her off your hands.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.333
Not happening.

11:56.625 --> 12:01.833
Why don't you be good little clones
and stand down?

12:01.833 --> 12:04.625
We're not big on following orders.

12:40.625 --> 12:43.125
I wasn't planning on killing you,

12:43.708 --> 12:46.791
but you're making it very tempting.

12:46.791 --> 12:48.541
We're good like that.

12:58.125 --> 13:01.708
I got the white blossom!

13:02.375 --> 13:04.125
Wh-- Stop!

13:04.125 --> 13:05.375
What's going on?

13:05.375 --> 13:07.791
She's been lying to us, Omega.

13:07.791 --> 13:09.166
She's a war criminal.

13:09.166 --> 13:11.416
Times have changed.

13:11.416 --> 13:14.541
Something
you clones should be familiar with.

13:14.541 --> 13:16.833
We are not the same.

13:16.833 --> 13:21.250
No? We were pawns in the same war.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.291
And we all lost.

13:26.541 --> 13:32.166
The Empire is more dangerous
than you could possibly fathom.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.458
I'm many things,

13:37.125 --> 13:39.791
but I am not your enemy.

13:48.416 --> 13:50.125
Ventress can't be trusted.

13:50.708 --> 13:55.375
You don't know the things she did
during the war, Omega. We do.

13:55.375 --> 13:58.541
Okay, but if she's as bad as you say,

13:58.541 --> 14:01.708
then why didn't she kill you
when she had the chance?

14:01.708 --> 14:03.500
Oh, we were just getting warmed up.

14:04.291 --> 14:07.875
I don't know much about the war,
but things are different now.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.000
People can change.

14:10.500 --> 14:12.083
You're being naive.

14:14.625 --> 14:16.791
I never gave up on you, did I?

14:20.625 --> 14:23.000
I say we give her a chance.

14:30.708 --> 14:32.833
No chaperones today?

14:32.833 --> 14:35.958
Nope. You said, "No distractions."

14:45.666 --> 14:47.666
I'm surprised you came to find me.

14:48.250 --> 14:51.583
They must have told you
all about the things I've done.

14:51.583 --> 14:53.000
They did.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.750
But you also stuck around
instead of leaving,

14:55.750 --> 14:58.375
so I think you're trying to help me.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.083
And you like us. I can tell.

15:01.958 --> 15:04.416
You're an odd little clone.

15:04.416 --> 15:07.083
Thanks. So what did the tests tell you?

15:07.083 --> 15:08.750
You failed the first one.

15:10.500 --> 15:12.125
But I passed the second.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.250
That has to mean something, right?

15:15.250 --> 15:17.500
Hmm. We'll see.

15:22.958 --> 15:26.208
Get in. Time for your final test.

15:35.583 --> 15:37.083
Stop smiling.

15:37.958 --> 15:39.416
It's unsettling.

15:52.708 --> 15:54.458
Should we be out this far?

15:55.208 --> 15:57.541
It'll be easier to concentrate.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.791
On what, exactly?

15:59.791 --> 16:04.083
Many who wield the Force
have an affinity for nature.

16:04.583 --> 16:08.041
They connect with things
that respond to their energy.

16:08.875 --> 16:09.875
Give it a try.

16:16.416 --> 16:19.666
Close your eyes and reach out.

16:19.666 --> 16:20.875
For what?

16:21.500 --> 16:22.541
Everything.

16:33.125 --> 16:36.666
I don't like this.
We should be out there with her.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.416
We gave Omega our word
we wouldn't intervene.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.791
You did.

16:48.875 --> 16:52.875
How--
How does she know we're watching?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.000
Forget it.

17:00.666 --> 17:02.291
Giving up so soon?

17:02.916 --> 17:05.833
This isn't working. I don't feel anything.

17:05.833 --> 17:08.666
I don't even know
what I'm supposed to be doing.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.958
This is a waste of time.

17:11.458 --> 17:14.166
I blame those three overprotective shadows

17:14.166 --> 17:16.750
for your lack of training and discipline.

17:17.583 --> 17:19.583
I am trained.

17:20.291 --> 17:23.125
This is different than being a soldier.

17:23.958 --> 17:29.416
Even if you have Force potential,
they can't show you how to tap into it.

17:35.291 --> 17:40.666
Since you seem content with that,
perhaps this is a waste of time.

17:40.666 --> 17:43.541
I bet you don't understand
any of this either.

17:44.166 --> 17:46.333
So, why should I listen to you?

18:32.041 --> 18:34.416
I'm not the one holding back.

18:40.750 --> 18:43.000
What happened? Why'd they go?

19:03.583 --> 19:05.583
Well, that doesn't look good.

19:05.583 --> 19:06.791
Get to the <i>Marauder</i>.

19:13.041 --> 19:14.583
Did you summon that?

19:14.583 --> 19:16.125
Not intentionally.

19:18.041 --> 19:19.625
Hang on.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.583
What?

20:30.791 --> 20:34.416
Your friends are making things worse.
I can do this on my own!

20:38.541 --> 20:40.250
Hunter, stop firing.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.833
<i>Ventress can handle it.</i>

20:41.833 --> 20:43.500
Doesn't look like it from up here.

20:44.041 --> 20:45.083
<i>Trust her!</i>

21:20.791 --> 21:22.916
You actually did it.

21:23.833 --> 21:25.750
Don't sound so surprised.

21:54.625 --> 21:58.708
Well, that was pretty fun.

22:22.708 --> 22:26.000
Did you figure it out?
Do I have a high M-count?

22:26.583 --> 22:28.041
From what I've seen?

22:29.125 --> 22:30.416
No.

22:30.416 --> 22:33.666
Then why's the Empire after me?

22:34.625 --> 22:38.500
Believe it or not,
I don't know everything.

22:38.500 --> 22:42.833
But seeing as how a high M-count
would make you a target,

22:42.833 --> 22:44.750
consider yourself lucky.

22:44.750 --> 22:48.208
But I'm already a target.

22:48.208 --> 22:51.708
Uh, don't worry about it, kid.
We're gonna figure it out.

22:52.625 --> 22:54.583
Come on. Let's go get some chow.

22:58.833 --> 23:00.708
Thanks. For trying.

23:12.208 --> 23:13.958
You're lying.

23:13.958 --> 23:16.083
About which part?

23:16.083 --> 23:17.958
You tell us.

23:18.583 --> 23:23.083
If Omega did have that potential,
she'd have to be trained,

23:24.416 --> 23:27.875
which would mean leaving you behind.

23:27.875 --> 23:29.750
That's not happening.

23:29.750 --> 23:31.916
What you want is irrelevant.

23:32.541 --> 23:37.500
The fact is, the Empire is after her.
And they won't stop.

23:38.541 --> 23:41.666
If I were you, I'd leave this place.

23:42.541 --> 23:44.875
You're not as safe as you think you are.

23:48.250 --> 23:50.416
Our business is done.

23:53.250 --> 23:56.250
I still can't figure out
what side you're on.
