WEBVTT

02:16.595 --> 02:17.846
Good morning, Mr. Scout.

02:44.122 --> 02:48.377
One, two, three, four, five,

02:48.460 --> 02:54.591
six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11, 12.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.638
Thirty-two, 33, 34,

02:59.721 --> 03:03.725
35, 36, thirty-se--

04:31.980 --> 04:37.486
Okay, me and Helly will find the goat man
and other possible goat people.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.363
Dylan, hit the new break room.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.657
Maybe some of
the other departments use it too.

04:42.491 --> 04:43.575
Yeah. Maybe later.

04:45.369 --> 04:47.329
Okay. This is kind of important, Dylan.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.667
Yeah. I'm in a good groove here,
but don't worry about it. I'll get to it.

04:51.750 --> 04:56.338
Okay. Well, just show them the sketch.
Do not leave it behind.

04:59.007 --> 05:00.300
O&D.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.638
Yes, Irv. You can do this.

05:06.682 --> 05:07.683
I know.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.768
You guys really think
they're gonna let us roam around?

05:09.852 --> 05:13.021
They said on the video
we can go wherever we want.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.940
Lumon is listening, remember?

05:15.023 --> 05:17.109
I thought that meant
they were listening to our conversations.

05:17.192 --> 05:20.779
Yeah, he's right, Mark.
I did get the hint of a double meaning.

05:21.405 --> 05:23.490
Well, be discreet.

05:23.574 --> 05:26.368
If they don't know we're doing it,
how can they punish us?

05:28.912 --> 05:32.249
Hey,
you haven't been back there, have you?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.584
No, no.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.340
We've got you.

05:43.385 --> 05:44.386
Thank you, Helly.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.691
So, say we find her…

05:57.774 --> 05:58.901
Sorry?

05:58.984 --> 06:01.195
Say we get to the goat department
and they're like,

06:01.278 --> 06:05.073
"Yes, Ms. Casey's here.
She's in this goat cage."

06:05.157 --> 06:06.241
What do we do then?

06:06.325 --> 06:09.494
Well, we get her to the south stairwell…
I'll go with her…

06:09.578 --> 06:12.831
and once we're out the door,
my outie'll know what to do.

06:13.916 --> 06:17.002
Right. Okay. Well,
sounds like you've got it figured out.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.134
Are you sure you're okay
helping me out with this?

06:26.303 --> 06:28.096
Yeah, of course.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.808
Okay, good.

06:50.369 --> 06:51.370
Yeah.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.844
I… I…

07:52.389 --> 07:53.390
Dylan.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.685
I thought you were going to O&D.

07:58.604 --> 07:59.605
Dylan.

08:00.856 --> 08:03.025
I've recreated the paintings.

08:03.108 --> 08:07.446
The ones I told you about.
The ones my outie was working on.

08:07.529 --> 08:08.530
What?

08:08.614 --> 08:10.449
You see, I've been thinking.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.869
Maybe the hallway is really down here.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.539
Maybe that's what my dreams have been.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.460
We could look for it, Dylan.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.087
We could go today.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.673
You could accompany me.

08:28.550 --> 08:29.551
Yeah.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.597
Yeah, maybe.

08:33.679 --> 08:38.602
Or maybe you go yourself,
like, for stealth, you know?

08:39.686 --> 08:42.648
-Stealth?
-Yeah.

08:42.731 --> 08:45.317
Look, I can't really explain. I just--

08:47.819 --> 08:48.820
Miss Huang.

08:56.495 --> 08:57.621
Hall pass.

09:05.963 --> 09:07.130
Everything chill?

09:10.467 --> 09:13.470
Dylan G., come with me, please.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.768
Good morning, Seth.

09:20.853 --> 09:21.854
Natalie.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.150
Looks like your balloons
could use some coffee.

09:29.403 --> 09:31.572
-They were in the--
-I've got the Board.

09:32.865 --> 09:33.866
Of course.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.454
Hello.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.916
The Board says, "Hello."

09:48.589 --> 09:52.926
Hello. I want to thank the Board humbly
for my recent betterment.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.726
The Board says, "You're welcome."

10:03.687 --> 10:06.440
The Board is jubilant at your ascendance.

10:06.523 --> 10:10.027
It wants you to feel appreciated
and asks if you do.

10:11.987 --> 10:13.071
I do.

10:17.784 --> 10:22.539
The Board austerely desires for you
to feel connected to Lumon's history.

10:23.999 --> 10:25.000
To that end,

10:26.126 --> 10:31.965
please accept from the Board these
inclusively re-canonicalized paintings

10:32.049 --> 10:36.345
intended to help you see yourself
in Kier, our founder.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.210
Oh, my.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.838
You'll find the whole Kier cycle.

11:31.108 --> 11:33.360
The Board wishes to express
that I, Natalie,

11:33.443 --> 11:37.114
received the same gift
upon receipt of my current position

11:37.197 --> 11:39.616
and found it extremely moving.

11:41.535 --> 11:42.703
I'm grateful.

11:42.786 --> 11:43.620
Yes.

11:43.704 --> 11:49.877
It's meaningful
to see myself reflected in…

11:58.302 --> 12:00.179
The Board has concluded the call.

12:16.528 --> 12:18.864
Congratulations, Seth.

13:52.583 --> 13:53.584
Is that it?

13:54.084 --> 13:55.085
Think so.

14:31.163 --> 14:32.164
You're gonna--

14:36.793 --> 14:37.794
You sure?

14:41.048 --> 14:42.216
Okay.

14:47.262 --> 14:50.641
All right. Okay, we're doing this.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.437
Can you see anything?

14:56.605 --> 14:59.233
No. Careful, there's poop.

14:59.316 --> 15:00.651
Okay.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.281
Okay.

15:28.470 --> 15:29.638
Oh, my God.

15:30.931 --> 15:32.057
What the hell?

16:08.677 --> 16:10.387
Are you here to kill me?

16:13.557 --> 16:18.020
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I… Sorry. Hi, I'm Mark.

16:18.103 --> 16:21.481
-I'm Helly.
-And we're with Macrodata Refinement.

16:30.199 --> 16:31.617
What is this place?

16:34.828 --> 16:36.997
Mammalians Nurturable.

16:44.171 --> 16:48.008
Please, we mean you no harm.
We just wanna talk.

16:48.842 --> 16:49.843
Please.

17:51.905 --> 17:52.906
Irving.

17:54.283 --> 17:55.909
Felicia, hello.

17:56.410 --> 17:59.413
I'm sorry to pop in after all this time.

17:59.496 --> 18:01.832
I'm sure you must be very busy.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.376
It's good to see you.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.358
Her name's Ms. Casey.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.069
She's our former Wellness Director.

18:41.205 --> 18:42.206
Wellness…

18:48.712 --> 18:51.089
we don't abide such fripperies here.

18:55.344 --> 18:58.972
Right. Well, she's been retired, but
we believe she may still be on the floor.

18:59.598 --> 19:01.391
Are you sure you don't know her?

19:07.147 --> 19:10.400
Maybe you should take that page
of paper and be on your way.

19:11.443 --> 19:13.403
Not until you've answered my question.

19:17.074 --> 19:18.408
Mark.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.687
You should have left.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.708
It would be cool to know
what this is about.

20:15.716 --> 20:19.928
So, like, is it rude to keep asking
why you're a kid?

20:21.972 --> 20:26.852
I don't mean to impugn.
It's just like, are you okay, you know?

20:26.935 --> 20:28.812
They're not, like,
forcing you to be here, are they?

20:34.776 --> 20:35.861
Oh, fuck.

20:41.450 --> 20:43.785
Why are we going to the security room?

21:31.542 --> 21:32.543
Wow.

21:37.297 --> 21:38.298
Dylan?

21:41.260 --> 21:42.386
Hi.

21:44.221 --> 21:45.556
Hi.

21:51.436 --> 21:55.357
Dylan G.,
through good behavior and output,

21:55.440 --> 21:58.694
you've earned an 18-minute
visitation event with your outie's wife,

21:59.611 --> 22:00.612
Gretchen G.

22:02.990 --> 22:04.157
Cool.

22:04.908 --> 22:06.451
Your time begins now.

22:20.841 --> 22:22.009
Should we sit?

22:37.149 --> 22:38.150
Nice sack.

22:38.901 --> 22:39.902
Sorry?

22:41.195 --> 22:42.696
Your… The--

22:44.031 --> 22:48.493
Thanks. They made me put my stuff in here.

22:51.121 --> 22:52.289
Badass.

22:53.624 --> 22:57.669
You really don't know me at all?

22:59.046 --> 23:04.259
No. Well, I mean,
from the photos from just now, but…

23:06.220 --> 23:09.056
Yeah, Seth warned me
that this might be weird.

23:11.350 --> 23:13.852
-Who's Seth?
-Don't you--

23:13.936 --> 23:17.981
Please refrain from sharing information
that may be privileged or sensitive.

23:18.649 --> 23:19.650
Thank you.

23:20.359 --> 23:21.360
Okay.

23:21.443 --> 23:23.195
Who is that child?

23:23.946 --> 23:24.947
Miss Huang.

23:30.953 --> 23:35.999
Look. It's really nice to meet you,
but am I in trouble?

23:36.667 --> 23:39.711
Oh, no. No, you're not in trouble.

23:45.217 --> 23:46.760
We have three kids.

23:48.637 --> 23:49.638
Right.

23:49.721 --> 23:53.934
And you…

23:54.017 --> 23:56.144
No, he… Or--

24:00.649 --> 24:05.445
My husband has had trouble
keeping other jobs.

24:07.072 --> 24:08.073
He dumb?

24:08.657 --> 24:09.950
No.

24:10.450 --> 24:11.326
He a dick?

24:11.410 --> 24:12.661
No.

24:13.287 --> 24:14.788
What is wrong with him?

24:14.872 --> 24:16.957
Nothing's wrong with him.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.209
He just…

24:21.753 --> 24:24.089
He never quite found his thing.

24:30.929 --> 24:35.559
So he's actually kind of a fuck up?

24:44.651 --> 24:47.070
Do you wanna see a picture of the kids?

24:49.656 --> 24:50.741
Yeah.

24:54.453 --> 24:55.996
Okay.

25:04.713 --> 25:07.508
So, Jim is six.
He's in the first grade now.

25:08.759 --> 25:10.677
And Ruth is four.

25:11.553 --> 25:13.972
And Merrick just turned two.

25:14.848 --> 25:15.891
Wow.

25:16.725 --> 25:18.060
Holy shit.

25:20.479 --> 25:21.480
Look at them.

25:23.899 --> 25:24.900
They're awesome.

25:27.027 --> 25:28.028
They are.

25:34.660 --> 25:36.453
And we live on a cattle ranch?

25:42.543 --> 25:44.795
And then… And Burt says,

25:46.296 --> 25:50.008
"I don't care if
you're Baird goddamn Eagan,

25:50.092 --> 25:54.179
you don't come to my department
and tell me how to print a snow globe."

25:57.474 --> 26:00.477
I ca… My God, he was fearless.

26:00.561 --> 26:03.939
I worked with Burt for six years.

26:04.773 --> 26:07.234
And I only ever saw him
scared of one thing.

26:09.486 --> 26:13.448
He spent two hours on his hair
the first time he went to visit you.

26:14.533 --> 26:15.534
Really?

26:18.996 --> 26:22.374
I should show you something.

26:24.209 --> 26:26.628
-If we see her--
-Not her. It's a…

26:29.339 --> 26:30.465
Here.

26:34.344 --> 26:38.765
Oh, Irving, it's lovely.

26:39.266 --> 26:42.102
I'd draw one every day I couldn't see him.

26:42.811 --> 26:45.397
My numbers went down,
but I didn't even care.

26:54.823 --> 26:56.909
Oh, no. That's not Burt.

26:56.992 --> 27:00.579
That's something else.
That's just a… That's nothing.

27:01.914 --> 27:03.248
It's…

27:06.168 --> 27:08.629
How do you know about the exports hall?

27:13.467 --> 27:14.551
I'm sorry?

27:19.097 --> 27:21.141
We send a lot of shipments there.

27:22.726 --> 27:24.311
Used to go ourselves.

27:25.270 --> 27:28.273
But now, they send a guy.

27:32.319 --> 27:35.155
Do you remember where it is?

27:46.458 --> 27:47.459
Hello.

27:49.378 --> 27:50.379
Hi.

27:59.388 --> 28:02.599
-Excuse me. Have you seen this woman?
-Hey! Stop that!

28:02.683 --> 28:04.935
Her name's Ms. Casey.
She was the Wellness director.

28:05.018 --> 28:07.271
-Stop that!
-Have any of you seen her?

28:08.021 --> 28:12.526
Enough! We've decided to send a courier
to inform Mr. Milchick of your inquiry.

28:12.609 --> 28:15.737
No. You can't do that.
They could kill her if they find out--

28:15.821 --> 28:18.115
That's not a Mammalians problem.

28:18.198 --> 28:19.908
It's an innie problem.

28:19.992 --> 28:22.661
Listen, we used to be afraid of
other departments too--

28:22.744 --> 28:23.954
We're not afraid of you.

28:24.872 --> 28:27.249
Look, they just disappeared her.

28:27.332 --> 28:29.793
And if we let this happen to Ms. Casey,

28:29.877 --> 28:32.546
then who's gonna step up
when it happens to us?

28:38.260 --> 28:42.222
If one of your goats went missing,
wouldn't you go looking for it?

29:03.702 --> 29:06.997
She used to come do her sessions
in our husbandry tanks.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.837
She had a gentle way about her.

29:15.964 --> 29:18.967
She said my outie excels at stargazing.

29:21.595 --> 29:23.055
Meant a great deal to me.

29:28.393 --> 29:33.232
As far as we know,
she was retired, just like they say.

29:35.817 --> 29:41.198
But if you suspect otherwise,
we won't hinder your search.

29:43.116 --> 29:44.201
Thank you.

29:44.993 --> 29:46.203
Yes, thank you.

29:56.588 --> 29:58.549
But before you go, we would…

30:02.928 --> 30:04.596
like to see your bellies.

30:07.516 --> 30:08.725
Our bellies?

30:11.103 --> 30:12.104
Please.

30:17.025 --> 30:18.026
Okay.

30:29.204 --> 30:31.164
See? Pouchless.

30:34.334 --> 30:35.460
Proves nothing.

30:41.550 --> 30:42.759
Okay. Let's--

30:42.843 --> 30:45.262
-So we'll just… Yeah.
-Yeah.

30:59.860 --> 31:01.612
I'm glad we did this.

31:02.487 --> 31:05.616
I mean, I hope, for you, this was…
I don't know.

31:07.618 --> 31:08.702
Yeah, it was.

31:10.245 --> 31:12.873
And I'll be good.
I'm gonna make you all proud.

31:15.167 --> 31:17.085
I'm always proud of you, Dylan.

31:18.504 --> 31:19.505
Cool.

31:30.224 --> 31:31.558
I love you.

31:35.812 --> 31:36.855
Sorry.

31:36.939 --> 31:38.023
-Habit.
-No, it's…

31:43.820 --> 31:44.821
Okay.

31:49.993 --> 31:50.994
All right.

31:55.415 --> 31:56.416
-Bye.
-Yeah.

32:26.947 --> 32:30.868
So remember Merrick's ear thing, okay?

32:30.951 --> 32:31.952
Copy that.

32:32.035 --> 32:34.204
-Left ear.
-Yep.

32:34.288 --> 32:37.124
And did you do the cookies
for Jim's class?

32:37.207 --> 32:38.208
Bye.

32:38.292 --> 32:40.252
It's our week for cookies.

32:41.170 --> 32:45.340
I did not do the cookies. Sorry.

32:47.009 --> 32:50.179
So, it's a tube
and you just need to slice them

32:50.262 --> 32:52.973
-and then you put them in the oven.
-Got it, yeah.

32:53.056 --> 32:54.057
Love you.

32:56.810 --> 32:59.813
Hey, how was the thing?

32:59.897 --> 33:00.898
What thing?

33:03.025 --> 33:04.151
The thing with me.

33:07.321 --> 33:08.947
Yeah, it was good.

33:09.031 --> 33:10.324
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

33:11.909 --> 33:13.619
Weird good, but good.

33:13.702 --> 33:15.037
Cool.

33:16.121 --> 33:20.250
Yeah. Okay. Okay, okay.
I'll see you in the morning.

33:20.334 --> 33:21.335
-Bye.
-Bye.

33:21.418 --> 33:22.794
-Bye.
-Bye.

33:29.801 --> 33:34.139
"But surely beer and juleps
cannot fill the void left by love.

33:34.806 --> 33:39.186
Indeed, only wine can achieve this,
but it is famously costly,

33:39.686 --> 33:43.815
which is why sadness is among the most
recurrent issues facing the poor."

33:44.858 --> 33:47.569
Remarkable. So astute.

33:47.653 --> 33:50.239
Is it? That's what I was going for.

33:50.322 --> 33:51.365
Hi.

33:52.574 --> 33:53.575
My babe.

33:54.743 --> 33:57.913
This is Natalie Kalen from Lumon.

33:58.789 --> 33:59.957
Is everything okay?

34:00.958 --> 34:02.334
Yes. God, yes.

34:02.835 --> 34:07.339
Natalie just stopped by
to discuss my book, actually.

34:09.091 --> 34:12.928
It's a joy to meet you, Devon.
You must be so proud.

34:15.222 --> 34:16.223
I am.

34:16.764 --> 34:18.641
I'm sure you know by now
that your husband's work

34:18.725 --> 34:20.893
has found its way onto our severed floor.

34:22.020 --> 34:24.313
Yeah. Do we know how that happened yet?

34:24.398 --> 34:29.152
So we've actually moved beyond that,
and we are now discussing the--

34:29.945 --> 34:31.989
What was the term you used?

34:32.072 --> 34:34.324
-The result.
-The result.

34:34.408 --> 34:37.703
Ricken's words have had a profound effect
upon our workers.

34:37.786 --> 34:39.663
We think he's really tapped
into something.

34:39.746 --> 34:44.251
And Natalie wants to discuss
a version of The You You Are,

34:44.333 --> 34:47.129
specifically for innies.

34:49.422 --> 34:53.969
Okay, well, that's cool. I mean,
but what's wrong with the current version?

34:54.594 --> 34:55.596
Nothing.

34:55.679 --> 34:58.724
No, the explanation
is actually very interesting.

35:03.103 --> 35:05.272
It's fascinating, actually. You, please.

35:05.355 --> 35:09.443
There's a certain verbiage
to which innies respond more favorably.

35:09.526 --> 35:11.445
If we just tweak it here and there.

35:12.362 --> 35:14.865
They think that it could be
a real game changer.

35:17.951 --> 35:18.952
Gotcha.

35:19.912 --> 35:22.456
I gotta go.
But she needs a bottle in an hour. So…

35:23.040 --> 35:24.166
Of course.

35:24.666 --> 35:26.877
-Devon.
-Yes?

35:28.045 --> 35:32.466
Can I just say, your brother is one of
the sweetest members of our severed team.

35:34.426 --> 35:35.677
Yeah, he's a good egg.

35:37.054 --> 35:38.805
Okay. One hour.

35:42.601 --> 35:44.520
So she said her name's Natalie?

35:44.603 --> 35:46.313
Natalie Kalen, I think.

35:47.189 --> 35:50.526
What… Was she asking,
like, what I'm up to or--

35:50.609 --> 35:52.945
Nope, 'cause it's Ricken they're after.

35:53.570 --> 35:55.405
-Ricken?
-Yep. His book.

35:55.489 --> 35:56.490
What?

35:56.573 --> 35:59.409
I guess you and your work friends
were so inspired by it.

35:59.493 --> 36:00.661
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-Yep.

36:00.744 --> 36:03.956
That they're… They wanna do
like an innie specific cut.

36:04.039 --> 36:07.793
Wow, okay. Well, there's just…
There's a lot I'm not gonna say.

36:07.876 --> 36:09.711
And that is so appreciated.

36:12.506 --> 36:14.675
Have you told Ricken
what we're doing here?

36:14.758 --> 36:16.760
-Are you insane? No.
-Okay.

36:18.345 --> 36:19.555
Good.

36:19.638 --> 36:22.641
Okay, so you need to see the afterimage
for, like, two and a half minutes?

36:22.724 --> 36:24.560
Two minutes, 18 seconds.

36:24.643 --> 36:27.980
It's from the parking spot
to the elevator, give or take.

36:31.066 --> 36:34.820
Yeah, I think the Whole Mind Collective
would be very proud of this.

36:35.320 --> 36:36.738
As well as your kindergarten teacher.

36:36.822 --> 36:38.699
What the fuck was her name?
Mrs. Lustgarten?

36:38.782 --> 36:41.368
-Yeah, Mrs. Lustgarten. Yeah.
-Wow.

36:41.869 --> 36:42.870
She really got me.

36:42.953 --> 36:46.456
Yeah. Fuck, I gotta skedaddle.

36:46.540 --> 36:48.417
Will you be careful, please?

36:49.251 --> 36:50.586
Yeah.

36:51.378 --> 36:52.713
Okay.

36:53.338 --> 36:54.464
I do love you.

36:56.383 --> 36:57.551
Okay.

36:57.634 --> 36:59.761
Even thought you left me
with the check at Pips, you dick.

37:00.554 --> 37:01.555
Thanks.

37:01.638 --> 37:03.098
You're welcome.

38:53.625 --> 38:58.172
Two, three, four, five,

38:58.255 --> 39:00.591
six, seven,

39:00.674 --> 39:04.261
eight, nine, ten,

39:04.344 --> 39:07.764
11, 12. Shit.

39:11.727 --> 39:12.728
Fuck.

40:18.252 --> 40:23.632
If you want me back,
you must accommodate my needs.

40:27.219 --> 40:28.387
I'm listening.

40:30.556 --> 40:33.267
MDR. Non-negotiable.

40:35.686 --> 40:41.066
Mark S. is so close
to completing Cold Harbor.

40:42.401 --> 40:45.863
I intend to finish the work
that I started,

40:47.406 --> 40:48.615
which is why

40:50.284 --> 40:51.827
Milchick must go.

40:53.078 --> 40:55.247
He's not equipped for the task.

40:57.624 --> 40:59.710
I must be floor manager.

41:05.549 --> 41:06.925
I hear ego…

41:11.013 --> 41:12.014
hubris…

41:14.016 --> 41:15.017
arrogance.

41:17.895 --> 41:20.522
Kier teaches us they only cause pain.

41:22.816 --> 41:25.235
Everything I accomplished, I earned…

41:28.405 --> 41:31.116
through dedication and industry,

41:32.284 --> 41:35.078
not because I was born into it.

41:42.961 --> 41:45.714
I think you've overestimated
your contributions

41:47.049 --> 41:49.218
and underestimated your blessings.

41:52.971 --> 41:54.723
We didn't have to ask you back.

41:58.018 --> 42:00.229
You didn't have a choice.

42:03.023 --> 42:04.149
Are you sure?

42:12.241 --> 42:13.742
Why don't we reset?

42:16.161 --> 42:17.746
It doesn't have to be this way.

42:30.217 --> 42:31.218
Natalie.

42:32.761 --> 42:36.139
Please see if the Board is available

42:37.057 --> 42:38.725
for Ms. Cobel and myself.

42:52.114 --> 42:53.699
Let's go speak with them together.

43:58.472 --> 43:59.473
Harmony.

44:45.185 --> 44:50.440
Thirty-three, 34, 35, 36,

44:51.692 --> 44:52.693
thirty s--

44:53.277 --> 44:54.987
Jesus Christ.

44:55.070 --> 44:59.491
Are you trying to burn a message
to your innie into your retinas

44:59.575 --> 45:03.370
because your computer told you
that was a brilliant idea?

45:06.081 --> 45:07.082
Yeah.

45:09.042 --> 45:12.004
No, no. What? No, no, no, no, no.

45:12.087 --> 45:14.339
What are you… What?

45:14.965 --> 45:16.258
It doesn't work.

45:17.342 --> 45:20.262
-No shit.
-The switch briefly dilates the pupils.

45:20.345 --> 45:21.180
Clean slate.

45:21.263 --> 45:23.765
-Okay, thank you. Thanks.
-Also, you could blind yourself.

45:23.849 --> 45:26.643
And how was the innie
gonna send you a message back?

45:27.644 --> 45:29.980
That's his problem. I don't know.

45:30.647 --> 45:32.399
Mark, unlock the door.

45:32.482 --> 45:33.483
Why?

45:34.234 --> 45:35.319
We need to talk.

45:36.028 --> 45:38.113
-Oh, my God.
-Mark, unlock the--

45:38.197 --> 45:41.658
Mark, unlock this fucking door!

45:45.954 --> 45:48.957
Goddamn it. This goddamn fucking thing.

45:52.586 --> 45:55.005
-What?
-There's an easier way.

45:57.633 --> 46:00.093
Didn't seem particularly easy for Petey.

46:02.179 --> 46:03.764
Heard about the OTC.

46:08.268 --> 46:12.064
Yeah, my sister talked to my innie.
He said a lot of things.

46:15.025 --> 46:17.402
Did he tell her
your wife is alive at Lumon?

46:20.948 --> 46:22.157
Who told you that?

46:33.418 --> 46:34.419
Is she?

46:45.013 --> 46:46.431
Is Gemma alive?

46:49.476 --> 46:51.353
She was, the last time I saw her.

47:32.186 --> 47:33.604
How could you not tell me?

47:34.104 --> 47:36.690
We were interrupted, if you recall.

47:37.691 --> 47:41.945
Mark, I want to help you,
but you have to trust me.

47:44.281 --> 47:45.282
How the fu…

47:45.365 --> 47:49.620
There is one way, and one way only,
to get information in and out of Lumon,

47:49.703 --> 47:51.538
and that's reintegration.

47:51.622 --> 47:55.792
I'm better at it now.
I can make it work with you.

47:55.876 --> 47:59.254
I can sew together a version of you that
loves her with a version of you that can--

47:59.338 --> 48:01.048
Yes. Do it.

48:04.927 --> 48:05.928
You're sure?

48:07.221 --> 48:08.764
I wanna see my wife.

49:04.069 --> 49:07.489
The monitors differentiate
the five brain wave frequencies

49:07.573 --> 49:08.699
of the innie and outie.

49:09.533 --> 49:11.869
Delta, theta, alpha, beta, gamma.

49:12.619 --> 49:16.957
One frequency, two waves per oscilloscope.

49:18.083 --> 49:21.336
The waves aren't in sync. Not yet, anyway.

49:22.337 --> 49:24.464
That's what we're here to do.

49:27.176 --> 49:28.177
Lean forward.

49:33.223 --> 49:34.766
Is it gonna hurt?

49:34.850 --> 49:36.226
Ideally not.

49:37.686 --> 49:39.271
What does your mouth taste like?

49:40.856 --> 49:41.857
Nothing.

49:41.940 --> 49:42.941
Good.

49:58.248 --> 50:00.167
What the fuck?

50:00.250 --> 50:01.251
Shit.

50:08.675 --> 50:09.676
You all right?

50:10.385 --> 50:11.720
I don't know. Am I?

50:12.763 --> 50:15.974
I'm gonna start with easy questions
and get more complex.

50:16.058 --> 50:17.309
Do you remember protocol?

50:19.561 --> 50:22.689
-Is that the first question?
-No, we haven't started yet.

50:22.773 --> 50:23.857
Yes, I remember.

50:23.941 --> 50:28.737
Relax your body. You should feel good
when this is over. Who am I?

50:30.364 --> 50:31.365
Okay, so are--

50:31.448 --> 50:33.033
We've started. Who am I?

50:33.116 --> 50:34.326
Asal Reghabi.

50:34.409 --> 50:35.410
Where are we?

50:36.245 --> 50:37.246
My basement.

50:38.455 --> 50:39.957
What was your mother's name?

50:40.457 --> 50:41.542
Fern Scout.

50:42.125 --> 50:43.460
What was her eye color?

50:47.548 --> 50:48.465
Seriously?

50:48.549 --> 50:51.426
Brown. It was brown.

50:51.510 --> 50:52.719
Did you love her?

50:54.137 --> 50:55.138
Yeah.

50:58.392 --> 51:00.227
Name a dam.

51:00.310 --> 51:01.311
Hoover.

51:03.146 --> 51:05.315
What does MDR stand for?

51:06.358 --> 51:07.192
What?

51:07.276 --> 51:08.819
MDR.

51:11.613 --> 51:13.448
-Mystic--
-That's wrong.

51:14.616 --> 51:16.869
What is something
for which you feel shame?

51:19.204 --> 51:20.414
Shame.

51:22.249 --> 51:25.210
My dog died when I was a kid.
It was my fault.

51:25.294 --> 51:26.587
Why?

51:28.297 --> 51:29.798
I left the gate open.

51:31.550 --> 51:32.593
Where were you born?

51:38.974 --> 51:40.142
I'm not sure.

51:41.351 --> 51:43.020
What month is it?

51:43.103 --> 51:44.188
You mean, what quarter?

51:46.190 --> 51:47.316
Wait.

51:48.317 --> 51:49.902
What is your first memory?

51:51.111 --> 51:54.072
-I don't know.
-Tell me.

51:56.116 --> 51:57.117
Holy shit.

51:58.702 --> 52:00.787
-I don't know. I don't remember.
-Tell me.

52:00.871 --> 52:03.165
-Tell me your first memory.
-I don't remember.

52:03.790 --> 52:05.876
Hey there, you on the table.

52:05.959 --> 52:08.170
I wonder if you'd mind taking
a brief survey.

52:09.671 --> 52:11.048
Five questions.

52:11.757 --> 52:15.135
To start out, who are you?
