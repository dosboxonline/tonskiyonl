What else?

03:14.884 --> 03:16.851
What about bringing in a third?

03:16.989 --> 03:18.577
- Kayla.
- I know a couple.

03:18.715 --> 03:19.958
Rad?

03:20.924 --> 03:22.961
You keep asking me and asking me

03:23.099 --> 03:25.032
and every time, I'm gonna
give you the same answer.

03:25.170 --> 03:26.758
If you're intimate
with another person

03:26.896 --> 03:28.863
other than the person
you're with, it's cheating.

03:29.001 --> 03:30.762
Period.
How come you can't see that?

03:30.900 --> 03:32.764
I don't think so.

03:32.902 --> 03:34.352
If you're in love with someone

03:34.490 --> 03:37.493
truly in love,
nothing can break that,

03:37.631 --> 03:40.185
not even both of us
fucking another person.

03:40.323 --> 03:42.049
Oh, my God, Kayla, why'd you
have to put it like that?

03:42.187 --> 03:43.671
- Like what?
- Fucking.

03:43.809 --> 03:45.501
- Fucking another person.
- Fucking, yes.

03:45.639 --> 03:48.607
'Cause that's what it is.
It's just sex.

03:48.745 --> 03:50.126
It's not what we have.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.301
We make love.

03:53.302 --> 03:54.820
Why do I feel like
your past relationships

03:54.958 --> 03:56.201
keep creeping into ours?

03:56.339 --> 03:58.134
Baby, I'm over my past.

03:58.272 --> 03:59.963
Really, then why aren't you
over this idea

04:00.101 --> 04:01.344
of being
in an open relationship?

04:01.482 --> 04:03.104
No. No, I never said that.

04:03.243 --> 04:05.417
I do not want
an open relationship with you.

04:05.555 --> 04:08.765
Maybe I've done that before,
but, baby, that is not us.

04:08.903 --> 04:10.388
I've not asked you for that.

04:11.527 --> 04:13.563
Okay, then what are you asking?

04:14.806 --> 04:16.117
I don't want us to get bored.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.534
I don't wanna get bored.
I know myself.

04:18.672 --> 04:20.190
I'm gonna get bored,
and I'll leave

04:20.329 --> 04:22.883
and I don't wanna do that,
not with you.

04:23.021 --> 04:25.679
This is actually
me fighting for us.

04:30.580 --> 04:34.550
No, I'm not,
I'm not cool with that

04:34.688 --> 04:36.862
and if you love me,
you'll respect that.

04:37.967 --> 04:40.763
Baby, don't.
Where are you going?

04:43.179 --> 04:46.527
Need a shower. You know,
wash off my stuffiness.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.922
Hmm, so beautiful.

05:38.821 --> 05:41.617
This is all a dream

05:42.549 --> 05:44.067
I don't think I want to wake up.

05:46.829 --> 05:50.039
Babe, get ready.
We're leaving in 30 minutes.

05:50.177 --> 05:51.385
Shit.

05:52.490 --> 05:54.354
Why'd we have to leave so early?

05:54.492 --> 05:56.390
Babe, it's like,
a four-hour drive.

05:59.462 --> 06:01.430
Think I'd rather just stay here,
and watch you all day.

06:06.642 --> 06:08.678

This last guy was some
Vegas hotel developer

No, it's definitely coming
from this way.

08:38.034 --> 08:39.760
No, that sounds like
a couple of animals.

08:39.898 --> 08:41.348

'cause we're doing
an all white party tonight.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.964
- You got the memo, right?
- Yeah, I believe Kayla...

14:22.102 --> 14:23.586
- Nice, nice.
- Packed them for me. So--

14:23.724 --> 14:26.003
- Fucking party time for sures.
- Yeah.

14:26.141 --> 14:29.247
Yeah. Anyway, you know,
if we could just stay on,

14:29.385 --> 14:32.423
just a stop for just a second,
trying to get the girls happy.

14:33.251 --> 14:34.735
- The drinks?
- Drinks.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.979
- Yeah, yeah.
- Mm, mm.

14:37.117 --> 14:38.739
Drinks, ladies, libations, sure.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.983
What should we get 'em?
Something from the bottom shelf.

14:41.121 --> 14:42.847
- Sure, that works. Yeah.
- Cool.

14:44.090 --> 14:46.126
'So what's with you two?'

14:47.024 --> 14:48.611
Is it serious?

14:49.578 --> 14:51.511
Hey, can you believe it?

14:51.649 --> 14:53.547
Wow, Kayla.

14:55.377 --> 14:58.380
So is it an open relationship,
or is it one of those

14:58.518 --> 15:00.969
vanilla, monogamous,
exclusive things?

15:01.107 --> 15:03.557
Glory, why do you have
to put it like that?

15:03.695 --> 15:07.044
Girl, we both know
you're not made for monotony.

15:07.182 --> 15:09.322
I know, I know.

15:09.460 --> 15:12.773
- But...
- "But", that's it?

15:12.912 --> 15:14.706
That's a big ass but.

15:14.844 --> 15:17.226
What is it with him?

15:18.848 --> 15:22.404
Oh, it's because
he wears a uniform.

15:22.542 --> 15:23.888
Hey, you know that turns me on.

15:24.026 --> 15:25.407
'I do.'

15:25.545 --> 15:27.927
No, but he's so sweet
and he's caring

15:28.065 --> 15:29.307
and compassionate.

15:29.445 --> 15:31.206
Oh, sorry, I just fell asleep

15:31.344 --> 15:32.483
listening to your bullshit.

15:35.693 --> 15:39.766
But really, Glory,
he is loyal as fuck,

15:39.904 --> 15:41.285
and I don't have to go
to bed at night worrying

15:41.423 --> 15:42.872
that he is gonna cheat on me.

15:45.358 --> 15:47.118
And the second reason?

15:47.256 --> 15:49.258
Come on, spit it out.

15:49.396 --> 15:51.812
He gives me balance.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.471
Jesus.
You and this balance shit.

15:55.609 --> 15:58.888
I'm over here overdosing
on the pleasures of life

15:59.027 --> 16:00.925
and you are stuck
in a yoga pose.

16:02.306 --> 16:03.963
- But he's a cop.
- So?

16:04.101 --> 16:06.862
And I could just get him
to loosen up a degree more

16:07.000 --> 16:08.450
it would be perfect.

16:09.313 --> 16:10.659
Hmm.

16:10.797 --> 16:12.833
I may be able
to help you with that.

16:12.972 --> 16:15.560
Not to let the cat
out of the bag too soon,

16:15.698 --> 16:19.979
but Angelo and I have
this sexy little thing going on,

16:20.117 --> 16:23.499
and I thought maybe
you'd be down to join us.

16:24.535 --> 16:25.743
Shit.

16:26.951 --> 16:29.678
I kind of told Rad that
this weekend would be about us.

16:29.816 --> 16:31.645
You know I love exploring.

16:33.061 --> 16:34.372
- And?
- But, hey.

16:34.510 --> 16:37.341
If I can get Rad to agree,
I'm in.

16:37.479 --> 16:38.721
Good.

16:39.791 --> 16:40.896
I'm down.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.244
Are you guys ready?

16:44.382 --> 16:46.695
Rad, does it look like
we're ready?

16:46.833 --> 16:48.179
Ooh, sorry.

16:48.317 --> 16:50.009
Babe, we'll be down
in a few minutes.

16:50.147 --> 16:51.493
'Alright, alright.'

16:51.631 --> 16:53.150
'Okay, laugh all you want'

16:53.288 --> 16:54.875
'but I have split my pants'

16:55.014 --> 16:56.705
squatting in front of
an entire yoga class before.

16:58.500 --> 17:01.089
- Wow, I wanna see that.
- Alright, cool.

17:01.227 --> 17:03.988
And, uh, so how did
you two meet again?

17:04.126 --> 17:05.196
Mmm.

17:06.853 --> 17:09.476
Rome, swinger party.

17:10.098 --> 17:11.892
- Glory.
- What?

17:12.031 --> 17:15.172
- 'Yeah.'
- So Rad must be a beast in bed.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.726
He is a beast.

17:18.968 --> 17:20.763
Yeah, does he use his handcuffs?

17:22.489 --> 17:26.183
No, not yet.
But I have a confession.

17:26.321 --> 17:27.908
We gotta here a little early
and caught

17:28.047 --> 17:30.014
you two fucking
in the living room.

17:31.809 --> 17:33.362
- Am I embarrassed?
- Certainly did.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.640
Oh, the hell you are.
You like being watched.

17:35.778 --> 17:38.816
I really do, and you. Oh.

17:38.954 --> 17:40.818
Yeah, I actually thought
you needed some help in there.

17:40.956 --> 17:42.854
I wasn't sure what to do.

17:44.166 --> 17:46.134
Um, Rad, it's called role play.

17:46.272 --> 17:49.654
- Hmm, oh, okay.
- You freak, did you like it?

17:51.346 --> 17:53.969
- A tad.
- Slut, you know you liked it.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.384
Don't listen to her.

17:55.522 --> 17:56.523
Was it as hot
as when I caught you

17:56.661 --> 17:57.593
banging our professor?

17:57.731 --> 17:59.733
- Wow.
- Glory, Jesus.

17:59.871 --> 18:01.977
- Whoa, professor?
- Yup.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.772
- Oh, this is good.
- Don't.

18:03.910 --> 18:04.876
- Why?
- Stop.

18:05.014 --> 18:06.085
No, I'm telling it.

18:07.016 --> 18:09.122
Yeah, so anyway, senior year

18:09.260 --> 18:11.607
I had transferred
from university in Sydney

18:11.745 --> 18:13.057
to college in the States

18:13.195 --> 18:15.163
and that's where
I met this girl, Kayla

18:15.301 --> 18:18.131
and I didn't think I could
find a girl as wild as I am.

18:18.269 --> 18:21.169
I caught her banging
our English professor.

18:21.307 --> 18:23.136
I guess someone was looking
for some extra credit.

18:23.274 --> 18:25.932
- Glory.
- Wow, really, Kayla?

18:26.070 --> 18:28.245
No surprise
if you're hanging with this one

18:28.383 --> 18:29.832
to lead you astray.

18:29.970 --> 18:31.834
- Can we not?
- 'Hey, hey, I'm guilty, too.'

18:31.972 --> 18:33.664
- 'I joined them.'
- Threesome, wow.

18:33.802 --> 18:36.253
- It just keeps getting better.
- It was more like a fuck fest.

18:36.391 --> 18:37.495
- Glory.
- Okay.

18:37.633 --> 18:39.048
'What? What?'

18:39.187 --> 18:41.120
'What did I say?
The truth, so punish me.'

18:42.293 --> 18:44.295
Uh, but guess what?

18:44.433 --> 18:46.849
Uh, it's the first time
I had Kayla go down on me.

18:46.987 --> 18:48.644
- 'Yeah, it was.'
- Wow, okay.

18:48.782 --> 18:50.612
- 'I wish I was there.'
- 'And?'

18:52.441 --> 18:54.478
'The real story comes out,
Kayla.'

18:55.755 --> 18:57.239
- 'Nice.'
- Kayla.

18:58.965 --> 19:01.864
Baby, there is one thing
that Angelo beats you at.

19:02.796 --> 19:04.108
Forgive my friend.

19:04.246 --> 19:05.834
She gets like this.

19:07.732 --> 19:09.251
Let me save you, Rad.

19:09.389 --> 19:11.115
Raise it up, what do we turn to?

19:11.253 --> 19:13.324
- To what?
- To you being my bridesmaid.

19:13.462 --> 19:15.050
Bitch, you don't have
any other friends

19:15.188 --> 19:16.603
who can put up with your shit.

19:16.741 --> 19:18.536
- Okay.
- 'Who else would be?'

19:18.674 --> 19:20.124
- Um, I told her a little bit.
- 'Hmm.'

19:20.262 --> 19:22.368
She said maybe,
but I'll take that as a yes.

19:22.506 --> 19:24.439
- Did she?
- Told her what?

19:24.577 --> 19:27.890
You know what, I'll explain
everything later, no worries.

19:28.028 --> 19:31.066
- Oh, to your wedding?
- Mmm, not so fast.

19:31.204 --> 19:32.895
We're not there yet,
but how about

19:33.033 --> 19:35.277
to this long fucking weekend
we're about to have?

19:35.415 --> 19:37.245
Fuck, yes,
to this yummy weekend.

19:37.383 --> 19:38.936
- Ah.
- Good time.

19:39.074 --> 19:40.627
- Love that.
- Alright.

19:40.765 --> 19:42.077
- Down the hatch.
- Let's fucking party.

19:42.215 --> 19:43.182
- Alright.
- Hmm.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.011
Uh-hmm.

19:45.149 --> 19:46.564
- Wow.
- Man, that is...

19:46.702 --> 19:47.669
- It's pretty strong.
- That is strong.

19:47.807 --> 19:49.326
I'm fucking ready for dessert.

19:49.464 --> 19:51.569
Glory, any ideas?

19:51.707 --> 19:53.882
- Good, or bad.
- Oh.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.297
Or naughty?

19:55.435 --> 19:57.126
You know, I'm getting
a little bored

19:57.265 --> 19:59.750
with this conversation so...

19:59.888 --> 20:01.821
Glory, what are you doing?

20:01.959 --> 20:04.789
Kayla, it's me reminding you

20:04.927 --> 20:07.067
how we always used
to live it up.

20:08.759 --> 20:10.070
Okay.

20:11.210 --> 20:13.108
- Um. Hmm.
- Did not expect that.

20:14.351 --> 20:15.904
Wow.

20:16.042 --> 20:18.113
That Glory, bad influence.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.115
Okay, yeah, so...

20:21.461 --> 20:23.843
But I don't know,
it's kind of a good influence.

20:23.981 --> 20:25.431
I think I'm gonna join her.

20:26.604 --> 20:28.675
And I know
she's a lot to handle.

20:29.400 --> 20:30.988
And I hope you handle it.

20:31.126 --> 20:33.024
Hmm, good, yeah.

20:33.991 --> 20:35.164
'Glory.'

20:36.096 --> 20:36.994
- Hmm
- What do you think?

20:37.132 --> 20:39.928
About Glory, about him?

20:40.066 --> 20:41.412
Let's join them.

20:42.931 --> 20:44.001
Did that really happen?

20:44.139 --> 20:46.486
Baby, don't, not now.

20:49.524 --> 20:50.594
Okay.

20:51.629 --> 20:52.699
Alright, don't be
the last one in.

20:52.837 --> 20:54.045
Come on, babe, let's go.

20:58.912 --> 21:00.328
Oh, goodness.

21:00.466 --> 21:02.433
Oh, and look
who's decided to show up.

21:02.571 --> 21:04.401
- Party town.
- Come join us.

21:04.539 --> 21:06.610
- Party of four.
- Let's go.

21:06.748 --> 21:08.715
That's what I'm talking about.

21:20.934 --> 21:22.281

Rad.

Relax, man.

22:38.564 --> 22:39.841
Relax.

22:42.084 --> 22:45.018
Come on, just fucking work, dammit.

22:51.887 --> 22:53.199
'Rad.'

22:55.201 --> 22:56.685
'Baby, come back.'

22:58.411 --> 22:59.516
Coming.

23:04.659 --> 23:08.732
Look, Rad, Rad, Rad,
Rad, Rad. What's up, man?

23:08.870 --> 23:10.527
Here, here, here.
Try this, try this, try this.

23:10.665 --> 23:12.218
This will help.
It'll help loosen...

23:12.356 --> 23:13.978
- Trust me, go ahead.
- Alright.

23:14.772 --> 23:16.049
You okay with all this?

23:17.361 --> 23:19.156
- No, actually, I'm not, but--
- No, no, no.

23:19.294 --> 23:20.606
Doesn't look like
I have a choice.

23:20.744 --> 23:22.159
'No, you have a choice, man.'

23:22.297 --> 23:23.540
'I mean, come on,
I mean, look, alright,'

23:23.678 --> 23:25.093
'if it makes it easier,'

23:25.231 --> 23:27.716
how about you and Kayla
watch us first?

23:27.854 --> 23:30.167
See how it goes,
get in the mood.

23:30.305 --> 23:32.065
Okay, okay. How about, alright.

23:32.203 --> 23:35.793
Even easier, me and Glory
watch you guys

23:35.931 --> 23:38.382
and when you feel comfortable,
we can jump in.

23:38.520 --> 23:40.695
Bro, bro, look,
I'm not trying to be naked

23:40.833 --> 23:42.006
around another guy.

23:42.144 --> 23:43.732
- I'm not gay, alright?
- No one's...

23:43.870 --> 23:45.872
You're missing
the big picture, man.

23:46.010 --> 23:47.391
No one's calling you gay.

23:47.529 --> 23:49.220
And it's not about
being gay or straight.

23:49.358 --> 23:50.877
None of that, man.
It doesn't even matter.

23:51.015 --> 23:52.914
If you're sure about yourself

23:53.052 --> 23:55.261
you can be naked
around anyone, man.

23:55.399 --> 23:57.263
And besides, dude,
you already seen me naked.

23:57.401 --> 23:58.954
- I mean, come on, bro.
- Yeah.

23:59.092 --> 24:01.094
And I'm trying to get
that picture outta my mind.

24:01.232 --> 24:03.269
Alright, look, fair enough,

24:03.407 --> 24:05.478
but the ladies
are having a good time.

24:05.616 --> 24:08.136
I know you don't want
to crash the party.

24:08.274 --> 24:10.828
I know Kayla wants
you to have a good time, so...

24:12.312 --> 24:13.417
Alright.

24:14.487 --> 24:15.695
Fuck it.

24:15.833 --> 24:17.456
I'll sacrifice.

24:17.594 --> 24:19.285
I'll go first.

24:19.423 --> 24:22.322
Follow my lead, alright?
You're welcome to Glory.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.945
You're welcome to have
a good time for you.

24:24.083 --> 24:25.809
It won't insult me,
anything like that, okay?

24:25.947 --> 24:27.051
I'll take lead.

24:27.189 --> 24:28.812
See what happens, okay?

24:28.950 --> 24:30.469
- Got this. Here.
- I don't know, man.

24:30.607 --> 24:32.471
More fire water
gives you courage.

24:32.609 --> 24:33.679
- Yeah.
- No worries.

24:34.818 --> 24:36.336
Oh, ladies, part two.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.442
We are back with Rad in tow.

24:39.374 --> 24:40.996
Right, where did we leave off?

24:41.134 --> 24:43.343
I think I was right here.

24:47.762 --> 24:49.142
Rad...

24:49.280 --> 24:51.144
- What the fuck, man?
- What's up, man?

24:51.282 --> 24:52.629
I told you I was not cool
with this shit.

24:52.767 --> 24:55.804
- Rad, what the fuck?
- Oh, my.

24:55.942 --> 24:57.634
Alright, alright.

24:57.772 --> 24:59.325
A little too fast for you?

24:59.463 --> 25:00.395
I'm not cool with this.
Come on.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.190
Kayla, let's go.

25:05.573 --> 25:06.643
- Wow.
- Alright.

25:07.644 --> 25:08.645
Yeah, that's good.

25:09.749 --> 25:11.751
- It looks good on me, right?
- It does.

25:11.889 --> 25:14.305
Shucks, I guess it's just
doing your dick tonight.

25:15.410 --> 25:17.101
Well, I could think
of worse things.

25:17.239 --> 25:18.827
But you know what?

25:18.965 --> 25:20.829
I owe you, so let me show you
something special.

25:20.967 --> 25:23.522
- How about that?
- Sure, daddy, lead the way.

25:23.660 --> 25:24.937
Alright, cool.

25:29.148 --> 25:32.289
You can't go around
hitting my friends.

25:32.427 --> 25:34.912
Now, Angelo's your friend?
You just met him.

25:35.050 --> 25:36.224
What is your problem, Rad?

25:36.362 --> 25:38.295
- Jealous?
- Problem?

25:38.433 --> 25:40.469
That you had sex
with your best friend?

25:40.608 --> 25:42.644
- Who are you jealous of?
- Fuck, dunno where to start.

25:42.782 --> 25:45.302
I'm here with you, only you.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.994
We agreed this weekend
would be about having fun.

25:50.618 --> 25:52.930
What happened to you saying,
"You know, everything"?

25:53.068 --> 25:55.243
What are you talking about?

25:55.381 --> 25:57.003
Your professor, did you get an A

25:57.141 --> 25:59.247
for fucking your professor too,
or is that just Glory?

25:59.385 --> 26:01.767
I was 20, I didn't know better.

26:01.905 --> 26:03.769
Yeah, like now.

26:03.907 --> 26:06.426
You know, that was my past.
Are you gonna judge me?

26:06.565 --> 26:08.670
Who made you budge,
do I go around judging you?

26:08.808 --> 26:10.189
Are you so perfect?

26:10.327 --> 26:12.432
- And kiss Angelo, really?
- What?

26:12.571 --> 26:16.057
- It was a group thing.
- Group thing, Jesus.

26:16.195 --> 26:18.542
Kayla, you didn't tell me
what was gonna happen tonight.

26:18.680 --> 26:21.096
- I'm so lost.
- We did talk about it.

26:21.234 --> 26:23.202
I told you I wanted
to start exploring more

26:23.340 --> 26:25.756
and this was the perfect
opportunity to do stuff.

26:25.894 --> 26:28.069
Fuck, you set all this up,
didn't you?

26:28.207 --> 26:29.484
This is all just a big ploy

26:29.622 --> 26:30.899
to get me to come
to the dark side.

26:31.037 --> 26:34.109
What the hell. No, Rad, no.

26:34.247 --> 26:36.491
I didn't even know any of this
was going to happen.

26:36.629 --> 26:40.081
Yeah, really? Just believe
you now? How convenient.

26:40.219 --> 26:42.877
What a coincidence
that all this happens tonight,

26:43.015 --> 26:46.225
this weekend, and I'm just
supposed to accept this?

26:46.363 --> 26:48.261
Really, you think
that I would do that to you?

26:48.399 --> 26:51.299
Like I would be so malicious
and fuck you over like that?

26:51.437 --> 26:53.232
You know, you need
to stop treating me

26:53.370 --> 26:55.683
like some sort of suspect.
This isn't a crime.

26:55.821 --> 26:58.099
I didn't do anything illegal.

26:58.237 --> 26:59.548
You're always seeing
the negative and everything,

26:59.687 --> 27:02.413
just like a cop.
You know what?

27:02.551 --> 27:05.106
Why don't you go
chill the fuck out, officer.

27:53.188 --> 27:57.399
♪ Who can save me ♪

27:57.537 --> 28:00.817

28:43.894 --> 28:45.620
I'm gonna squirt.

29:35.601 --> 29:38.949
'Oh, my God. I deserve that.'

29:39.087 --> 29:40.399
I needed that.

29:42.953 --> 29:45.438
- Thank you, baby.
- Thank you, daddy.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.578
Fuck you too, man.

30:27.032 --> 30:28.930
Kayla, baby.

30:31.312 --> 30:32.347
What?

30:33.279 --> 30:35.972
Why are you sitting
alone in a bathtub?

30:38.077 --> 30:39.182
Don't worry about it.

30:41.701 --> 30:43.427
Earlier, I told you a little bit

30:43.565 --> 30:45.533
about that whole thing
with Angelo.

30:47.086 --> 30:50.641
What that he's your master now,
you belong to him?

30:52.540 --> 30:54.922
Sounds like the life. Lucky you.

30:56.509 --> 30:59.719
That's just the surface.

31:01.307 --> 31:02.653
But first.

31:15.356 --> 31:16.667
Ah.

31:18.738 --> 31:21.880
Brother Rad,
what you doing up there, man?

31:22.708 --> 31:23.882
I don't know.

31:25.918 --> 31:28.265
Won't you come down here,
shoot some shit with me?

31:33.236 --> 31:34.271
Okay.

31:42.452 --> 31:43.763
Come on, man, I won't bite.

31:45.282 --> 31:47.353
It's a fucked up night, right?

31:47.491 --> 31:48.907
You think.

31:49.045 --> 31:51.495
You know what,
you'd live a lot longer...

31:52.807 --> 31:55.292
...if you didn't take things
so personal.

31:56.397 --> 31:58.813
Sharing the girl I love,
yeah, I don't know, man.

31:58.951 --> 32:01.195
I'm gonna take that
little personal.

32:01.333 --> 32:03.093
So what, cops can't enjoy life?

32:03.231 --> 32:04.681
I don't know.

32:04.819 --> 32:06.717
It's not about that, look.

32:06.855 --> 32:10.238
There's a difference
between legal and illegal.

32:10.376 --> 32:12.827
Like your coke habit,
for instance.

32:12.965 --> 32:14.553
What about it?

32:14.691 --> 32:17.073
It's the kind of thing
I put people in jail for.

32:17.211 --> 32:18.764
Rad

32:19.903 --> 32:22.595
I'm trying to get you
to stop thinking like a cop.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.943
Start feeling
like a human being.

32:25.736 --> 32:27.531
Life gave you a gift.

32:27.669 --> 32:29.292
Life was like, "Here, Rad,

32:29.430 --> 32:31.501
here's two beautiful
women in front of you."

32:31.639 --> 32:32.743
What are you gonna do?

32:34.090 --> 32:37.886
Man, come on, don't tell me
some cliche bullshit, like

32:38.025 --> 32:41.718
"You only live once,"
or, "Life is too short."

32:41.856 --> 32:44.617
You know what?
Life is as short as you make it.

32:44.755 --> 32:48.967
And I've been trying
my whole life to live forever.

32:49.898 --> 32:53.040
Yeah, well, how's that
working out for you so far?

32:55.628 --> 32:59.874
Well, hopefully, by the end
of this weekend, we'll find out.

33:01.324 --> 33:03.119
Girl, how do you do it?

33:03.257 --> 33:06.398
Because I know you don't do
yoga every day like I do.

33:06.536 --> 33:08.987
- Good genes maybe.
- Yeah, right.

33:09.125 --> 33:11.506
No, but seriously,
what's your secret?

33:11.644 --> 33:13.853
- You look flawless.
- Well

33:13.992 --> 33:17.374
When you live stress-free,
no work, no boss.

33:17.512 --> 33:19.376
No work, really?

33:19.514 --> 33:22.241
What about that VP status
you were pulling at the bank?

33:22.379 --> 33:24.933
Mmm, left that.

33:25.072 --> 33:27.902
The fuck when, that was
what Like 300K a year?

33:28.040 --> 33:29.835
- Five.
- Five?

33:29.973 --> 33:32.010
Glory, you left
half a mill on the table?

33:32.148 --> 33:33.252
For what, when?

33:34.184 --> 33:35.392
Angelo?

33:35.530 --> 33:36.462
For dick, for dude?

33:36.600 --> 33:38.223
Glory, what the fuck?

33:38.361 --> 33:40.432
Don't give me shit.

33:40.570 --> 33:44.022
Glory, after you stopped
dating the college professor

33:44.160 --> 33:46.196
you still kept your gig,
and the second guy was, what,

33:46.334 --> 33:47.887
a Vegas hotel developer,

33:48.026 --> 33:49.441
and you still didn't
give up your career.

33:49.579 --> 33:51.167
Your point is?

33:51.305 --> 33:53.652
My point is, Glory,
you don't give up your life

33:53.790 --> 33:56.206
for a guy because you... You.

33:56.344 --> 33:57.932
It doesn't end up working out,
and you're gonna leave him

33:58.070 --> 34:01.004
and then what?
You're left with nothing?

34:01.142 --> 34:03.248
But what if it's forever
this time?

34:04.283 --> 34:07.493
Give me a moment
and let me throw the fuck up.

34:07.631 --> 34:09.633
- Kayla, stop.
- Glory, seriously.

34:09.771 --> 34:11.980
What the fuck did you do?

34:12.119 --> 34:13.672
Is Angelo really that loaded?

34:14.742 --> 34:16.088
Oh, my God.

34:16.744 --> 34:18.228
Don't tell me
it's about the sex.

34:19.160 --> 34:21.128
Kayla, have you squirted?

34:22.232 --> 34:24.407
- What are you drinking?
- Have you?

34:24.545 --> 34:26.892
- What is it?
- Fuck me, you haven't.

34:27.030 --> 34:29.136
You poor thing.

34:29.274 --> 34:30.792
Not funny.

34:31.621 --> 34:33.036
Hey.

34:34.451 --> 34:35.694
What's it like?

34:38.179 --> 34:41.803
You know, before I met Angelo

34:41.941 --> 34:44.047
I thought it was some myth.

34:44.185 --> 34:46.118
Like, something only
porn stars could do

34:46.256 --> 34:48.672
because they've taken
so many dicks.

34:48.810 --> 34:51.158
In the past, I thought
I just needed to pee.

34:51.296 --> 34:54.816
So time and time again,
I stopped.

34:55.679 --> 34:57.681
I mean who the fuck
wants to take a piss in bed

34:57.819 --> 34:59.027
while having sex?

34:59.166 --> 35:02.169
But I had it all wrong

35:02.307 --> 35:04.826
this whole time.

35:04.964 --> 35:07.381
Do you know
how rare it is to squirt?

35:07.519 --> 35:08.589
No, how rare?

35:08.727 --> 35:10.453
Fucking rare.

35:10.591 --> 35:12.248
Are you fucking kidding me?

35:12.386 --> 35:16.217
We are depriving ourselves
this gift from the Gods.

35:16.355 --> 35:18.392
Fuck, and when you put it
that way.

35:19.807 --> 35:23.017
You see, in order to squirt,

35:23.155 --> 35:25.778
the secret is you've gotta
relax,

35:25.916 --> 35:28.022
and I mean, fucking relax.

35:28.160 --> 35:29.817
And I'm not talking
about the body.

35:31.094 --> 35:32.647
I've been fucked
a thousand times,

35:32.785 --> 35:36.030
and my body's felt helpless
and totally relaxed.

35:36.168 --> 35:37.756
I'm talking about the mind.

35:37.894 --> 35:39.137
It's all mental.

35:40.241 --> 35:42.519
Angelo's the one who guided me.

35:42.657 --> 35:45.453
Finally, Kayla, I have met a man

35:45.591 --> 35:48.974
who has the patience
to not just fuck my brains out

35:49.112 --> 35:50.700
but who genuinely
wants me to reach

35:50.838 --> 35:52.978
the highest rounds of pleasure.

35:53.116 --> 35:56.740
Like, squirting is like,
being mind-fucked first,

35:56.878 --> 35:58.915
and then once your mind relaxes

35:59.053 --> 36:01.780
it tells your body to trigger
something in your kitten.

36:01.918 --> 36:03.264
Trigger?

36:03.402 --> 36:05.301
I have to believe
we all have it.

36:05.439 --> 36:08.442
I mean, I went from squirting,
from being fingered

36:08.580 --> 36:12.549
to being fucked,
to then being eaten out.

36:12.687 --> 36:14.689
Ah, Kayla.

36:14.827 --> 36:18.072
When you start squirting,
your whole pussy comes alive.

36:19.315 --> 36:20.764
Hail Satan.

36:20.902 --> 36:22.904
You make it sound
like mine is dead.

36:23.042 --> 36:26.253
No, baby, it just needs
to be awakened.

36:26.391 --> 36:27.771
Fuck it, hype it up enough?

36:28.600 --> 36:30.912
Okay, can I get a drink now?

36:31.050 --> 36:33.398
Ah, you don't wanna go down
this rabbit hole.

36:33.536 --> 36:36.021
Bitch, come on, share.

36:36.159 --> 36:37.919
Are you sure
you wanna be a squirting

36:38.057 --> 36:40.232
badass goddess like me?

36:40.370 --> 36:42.476
You know, I'm good for it.

36:42.614 --> 36:45.444
- I actually can't.
- And why the hell not?

36:45.582 --> 36:48.413
Because you're not one of us.

36:49.759 --> 36:50.863
Who?

36:52.071 --> 36:53.280
Angelo and me.

36:54.281 --> 36:56.662
I haven't been
totally honest with you,

36:56.800 --> 36:59.665
but I thought you might
be down to join us.

36:59.803 --> 37:00.977
I'm here, aren't I?

37:03.738 --> 37:05.706
Yeah, it's more than that.

37:05.844 --> 37:07.086
Just listen.

37:09.054 --> 37:10.228
I don't get it.

37:11.850 --> 37:12.954
Get what?

37:14.853 --> 37:18.408
Oh, what, that I'm okay with
you being intimate with Glory?

37:18.546 --> 37:20.859
I mean, swapping
is just physical, man.

37:20.997 --> 37:22.585
It's just in the moment.

37:22.723 --> 37:26.071
But what we do it,
we share it together

37:26.209 --> 37:27.590
and it's consensual.

37:28.694 --> 37:29.764
Does that make sense?

37:30.903 --> 37:33.423
Yeah, yeah,
I don't know about how...

37:33.561 --> 37:34.942
I don't know
how any of this could be

37:35.080 --> 37:36.944
good for a relationship, though.

37:37.082 --> 37:39.671
Seems like every time...

37:41.017 --> 37:44.538
...I get attached to a girl,
I get fucked over.

37:44.676 --> 37:48.196
So when Kayla starts asking me,

37:48.335 --> 37:50.406
"Hey, let's have a threesome"

37:50.544 --> 37:52.994
or, "Hey, let's get crazy
with another couple..."

37:53.132 --> 37:54.444
Uh-huh.

37:54.582 --> 37:57.136
Uh, you know,
I just really see that

37:57.275 --> 37:59.311
as a way of her wanting
to cheat, to be honest so--

37:59.449 --> 38:00.657
Jealousy's a bitch.

38:00.795 --> 38:02.038
It just means you're human, man.

38:02.176 --> 38:03.522
You're mortal.

38:03.660 --> 38:05.041
What the hell
are you talking about?

38:05.179 --> 38:06.974
I mean, what's crazy is already

38:07.112 --> 38:09.287
you've already imagined
what it would look like

38:09.425 --> 38:10.702
if I fuck Kayla in front of you,

38:12.013 --> 38:14.292
and it scares
the living shit out of you.

38:15.396 --> 38:17.467
It hasn't even happened yet

38:17.605 --> 38:18.951
and it shouldn't scare you.

38:19.089 --> 38:20.643
It should actually excite you

38:20.781 --> 38:23.301
because it opens up
so many possibilities.

38:23.439 --> 38:26.545
What? Why the fuck would
something like that excite me?

38:28.375 --> 38:30.238
I mean, I know
this is hard to hear

38:30.377 --> 38:33.794
but honestly,
I think you're a voyeur.

38:34.898 --> 38:37.245
There's a rare breed
of man out there

38:37.384 --> 38:39.903
that really gets turned on
by watching other men

38:40.041 --> 38:42.665
sleep with their
hot girlfriends and hot wives.

38:42.803 --> 38:44.874
I think you might
be in that category.

38:45.012 --> 38:47.083
What? Fuck, no, dude.

38:47.221 --> 38:49.741
Dude, I'm far from that category

38:49.879 --> 38:53.641
but, you know, it sounds like
you're in that category.

38:53.779 --> 38:55.747
I could definitely believe that.

38:55.885 --> 38:59.026
Ah, I know that's easy
to deflect it on me

38:59.164 --> 39:01.235
but no, actually,
I don't get turned on

39:01.373 --> 39:03.858
by watching other men
have sex with Glory, actually.

39:03.996 --> 39:05.757
Like, I don't even know
how we got on this subject,

39:05.895 --> 39:07.275
but you know what?

39:07.414 --> 39:09.968
It's kind of
freaking me out, man,

39:10.106 --> 39:12.004
even imagining this stuff.

39:12.142 --> 39:14.938
So let's just maybe
talk about something else.

39:15.076 --> 39:16.630
It's all mental, man.

39:16.768 --> 39:18.148
It's all in your head.

39:19.287 --> 39:21.462
Literally,
I mean, it is, literally,

39:21.600 --> 39:23.568
your ego
is stopping you from this,

39:23.706 --> 39:27.434
your insecurities
of being jealous and your ego.

39:27.572 --> 39:29.332
I mean, right now,
you're drinking yourself

39:29.470 --> 39:31.196
"Oh, my God,
what if I can't perform

39:31.334 --> 39:32.887
while other people watch me?"

39:33.025 --> 39:35.131
"Oh, oh, what if his dick
is bigger than mine?"

39:35.269 --> 39:37.271
"Oh, my God,
what if I cum too fast?"

39:37.409 --> 39:38.893
Let that shit go.

39:39.031 --> 39:41.033
Just disconnect that ego.

39:42.621 --> 39:44.416
You have to do that,
and I'm telling you

39:44.554 --> 39:47.315
if you stop thinking about
what's going to happen

39:47.454 --> 39:49.732
and just let it happen.

39:52.631 --> 39:56.152
Really?
If I give in to doing this?

40:00.190 --> 40:04.747
Yeah, you keep her wild
by being wild yourself...

40:05.472 --> 40:08.371
...she's gonna love you
for it, watch.

40:13.376 --> 40:14.515
Alright.

40:16.068 --> 40:19.382
Fuck it, I...I guess.

40:19.520 --> 40:22.523
Try it. I mean,
try everything once, right?

40:22.661 --> 40:26.354
I mean, Kayla is...
Keep bugging me about it so.

40:27.494 --> 40:30.531
Rad, are we good now?

40:32.015 --> 40:33.741
That's, uh...
Sorry about the punch.

40:33.879 --> 40:37.676
I mean, I guess
I overreacted so.

40:42.198 --> 40:43.889
It's almost a...

40:44.027 --> 40:45.443
It's almost a full moon,
isn't it?

40:46.133 --> 40:49.101
Almost... tomorrow.

40:50.655 --> 40:53.347
Lies.

40:53.485 --> 40:54.555
Lies all of it.

40:54.693 --> 40:57.351
What the fuck, since when?

40:57.489 --> 41:00.319
Last year,
when I went to Bora Bora,

41:00.458 --> 41:02.667
I woke up a dawn
to the rising sun

41:02.805 --> 41:05.946
and everything inside me
felt alive.

41:07.085 --> 41:10.295
The first day, I was reborn.

41:10.433 --> 41:12.193
I felt like a volcano.

41:12.331 --> 41:13.816
My body,

41:13.954 --> 41:16.266
everything inside of me
boiled up...

41:16.957 --> 41:19.269
...until I couldn't
take it anymore.

41:19.407 --> 41:21.927
I had to have sex.

41:22.065 --> 41:23.135
Lies.

41:23.757 --> 41:26.484
And now... I can't get enough...

41:27.554 --> 41:30.142
...of everything... all of it.

41:31.143 --> 41:33.249
I am addicted to pleasure.

41:33.387 --> 41:34.837
Addicted to life.

41:36.735 --> 41:40.187
Fuck it. I'm down. Down,
down, down, down, down.

41:40.981 --> 41:42.051
Let's go.

41:43.604 --> 41:46.158
Kayla, all jokes aside...

41:47.125 --> 41:49.230
...I'm not trying to
convince you about this.

41:50.162 --> 41:52.475
If you want what I have,

41:52.613 --> 41:54.650
what Angelo has...

41:54.788 --> 41:56.479
...this has to be your choice.

41:59.965 --> 42:02.830
Pretty. Looks old.

42:04.729 --> 42:05.868
Ancient.

42:07.904 --> 42:09.768
Just a taste of what's to come.

43:01.233 --> 43:02.856
Your castle's huge, man.

43:02.994 --> 43:04.754
Are you sure, how do you know
they're even down here?

43:04.892 --> 43:07.032
I don't know,
I could just sense it.

43:07.170 --> 43:08.171
I don't know, you know?

43:08.309 --> 43:09.897
Hey, I could be wrong.

43:14.108 --> 43:15.869
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

43:33.231 --> 43:35.060
Let's find out.

43:46.244 --> 43:48.626
- No, don't.
- I thought we supposed to--

43:48.764 --> 43:51.249
No, no, no, no, no.
Shh, shh, shh.

44:02.847 --> 44:04.158
What is it?

44:04.296 --> 44:06.195
Let, just let the ladies
have their moment.

44:06.333 --> 44:07.714
I don't understand.

44:07.852 --> 44:08.956
We're already here,
why don't we just...

44:09.094 --> 44:10.993
Well, we got all weekend, right?

44:11.131 --> 44:12.304
There's no rush.

44:12.442 --> 44:14.203
Let the ladies catch up

44:14.341 --> 44:17.344
and if they really want us,
they'll let us know, right?

44:17.482 --> 44:18.690
Keep her wild, right?

44:18.828 --> 44:21.072
That's right, that's right.

45:55.856 --> 45:57.547
Did I do good, daddy?

45:58.479 --> 46:01.172
You did so good.

46:01.310 --> 46:03.036
As long as it was her choice.

46:03.174 --> 46:05.314
- It really was.
- Was it?

46:05.452 --> 46:09.042
- Uh-hmm, she was ready.
- She was, huh?

46:09.180 --> 46:11.354
How's everything going with Rad?

46:11.492 --> 46:13.563
Oh, your boy, Rad.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.843
You know, I think
he's warming up to the idea.

46:18.637 --> 46:22.918
But in the meantime,
let's welcome Kayla properly.

46:23.815 --> 46:25.334
Uh-hmm.

46:25.472 --> 46:28.199
Would you like
some breakfast this morning?

46:28.337 --> 46:30.442
- Thought you would never ask.
- Hmm.

46:31.547 --> 46:32.582
Come here.

46:47.252 --> 46:48.598
Come here.

47:09.861 --> 47:11.552
Wake up, wake up.

47:11.690 --> 47:14.107
Wake up, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

47:14.245 --> 47:15.211
Wake up.

47:16.834 --> 47:19.940
Glory, stop, don't.

47:20.078 --> 47:21.804
Hey, how do you feel?

47:25.566 --> 47:28.707
My contacts,
I think I slept with them in.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.951
Why, is everything clear?

47:32.125 --> 47:33.229
Clear?

47:35.231 --> 47:37.440
- Yeah, I'm not blind.
- Uh-hmm.

47:38.338 --> 47:41.272
Or maybe you don't need to
wear them anymore because...

47:41.410 --> 47:43.205
- No fucking way.
- Yup. Yup.

47:44.033 --> 47:45.414
- I'm a...
- Uh-hmm.

47:47.209 --> 47:49.970
Welcome to a whole new world.

47:50.108 --> 47:52.214
A whole new everything.

47:53.387 --> 47:55.631
Alright, get up,
let's go to the pool.

47:55.769 --> 47:56.908
Alright.

48:05.054 --> 48:06.262
Rad.

48:18.826 --> 48:20.173
<i>Baby, come on.</i>

48:31.632 --> 48:32.875
<i>Come back.</i>

48:42.505 --> 48:45.232
<i>Oh. Rad.</i>

48:56.209 --> 48:58.038
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.</i>

49:01.179 --> 49:02.249
<i>Rad.</i>

49:10.223 --> 49:11.327
<i>Don't stop.</i>

49:12.466 --> 49:14.020
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.</i>

49:14.158 --> 49:15.987
<i>Oh. Oh, baby.</i>

49:17.161 --> 49:19.646
Oh, my God.

49:19.784 --> 49:21.441
<i>Oh, oh, yeah.</i>

49:45.948 --> 49:47.329
What the fuck?

49:56.959 --> 49:57.995
Kayla?

49:59.962 --> 50:00.998
Kayla?

50:08.005 --> 50:09.006
Kayla?

50:14.804 --> 50:15.909
Kayla?

50:51.979 --> 50:54.189
- Hey, Sylvia.
- 'Hello?'

50:54.327 --> 50:57.123
- Hey, it's Rad.
- 'Oh, hey, Rad. Are you off?'

50:57.261 --> 50:58.607
'How's your vacation?'

50:58.745 --> 50:59.987
Hey, can you...
Oh, yeah, it's good.

51:00.126 --> 51:01.782
'Jesus, I need a vacation.'

51:01.920 --> 51:03.784
Uh, hey, can you look up
a perp for me?

51:03.922 --> 51:05.648
- 'Yeah. What's the name?'
- Uh.

51:05.786 --> 51:08.375
Yeah, Angelo Veilious.

51:08.513 --> 51:11.654
- V-E-I-L-I-O-U-S.
- 'Okay.'

51:11.792 --> 51:14.623
'Angelo Veilious.'

51:14.761 --> 51:17.212
- 'No, nothing, no priors.'
- What, nothing?

51:17.350 --> 51:19.041
'Nope, actually,
he's not even in the system.'

51:19.179 --> 51:20.801
Strange.

51:20.939 --> 51:22.596
'Maybe he's America's foreign.'

51:22.734 --> 51:24.011
No, it's okay.

51:24.150 --> 51:25.875
Maybe another country, yeah.

51:26.013 --> 51:28.050
'Oh, we should
go for a warrant.'

51:28.188 --> 51:30.052
Uh, alright, that's fine.

51:30.190 --> 51:31.881
'Enjoy your vacation.
Take care, Rad.'

51:32.019 --> 51:34.056
Sure. Yeah, you, too, thanks.

52:11.093 --> 52:12.612
Hey, how was last night?

52:15.580 --> 52:17.237
Love. Kayla?

52:17.375 --> 52:18.376
How was it?

52:19.412 --> 52:22.380
Honestly, uh, I don't remember.

52:23.933 --> 52:25.142
But I feel great.

52:27.282 --> 52:29.146
Alright, well.

52:29.284 --> 52:31.148
- Want your contacts today?
- No.

52:33.840 --> 52:35.531
Hey, are you okay?

52:36.429 --> 52:38.155
You're blind as a bat.

52:38.293 --> 52:40.502
Silly, I'm not a bat.

52:40.640 --> 52:42.193
No, really, I'm good.

52:42.331 --> 52:43.781
More than good.

52:44.644 --> 52:46.335
Are you, are you good?

52:46.473 --> 52:49.166
Uh. Yeah, yeah, I think so.

52:49.304 --> 52:51.858
I mean, last night was crazy,

52:51.996 --> 52:54.619
and I wasn't at my best,

52:54.757 --> 52:57.277
and I kind of fucked up,
actually,

52:57.415 --> 52:59.003
but can you blame me?

52:59.141 --> 53:01.592
I wasn't ready for you
to be with someone else.

53:02.869 --> 53:05.147
No, I understand
and if being here

53:05.285 --> 53:07.080
isn't your thing,
then we can go.

53:08.392 --> 53:10.635
So just like that?
We'll just pack up our stuff.

53:10.773 --> 53:13.155
You leave your girl behind
and we'll just go.

53:14.363 --> 53:16.848
No, I don't wanna go.

53:16.986 --> 53:20.266
I wanna stay,
but this isn't about me.

53:21.336 --> 53:22.820
It's about you.

53:22.958 --> 53:26.513
You have your hangups,
and I don't so.

53:26.651 --> 53:27.963
Hangups.

53:28.101 --> 53:29.965
I'm just trying
to be respectful.

53:32.278 --> 53:34.072
Wow, alright.

53:41.597 --> 53:43.185
- Rad.
- What?

53:43.323 --> 53:45.360
Last night you had
the perfect opportunity

53:45.498 --> 53:48.190
to play it cool, and you
blew up and went into cop mode.

53:49.053 --> 53:50.399
That's what this is about.

53:50.537 --> 53:52.401
You had a problem
with me being a cop.

53:52.539 --> 53:56.336
'Oh, daddy.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.'

53:57.268 --> 54:00.444
Rad, no, I think it's hot
that you're a cop,

54:00.582 --> 54:03.654
but you're not recognizing
that I need to be fed.

54:03.792 --> 54:07.451
Our relationship
needs to be fed.

54:07.589 --> 54:10.074
It's called growing.
I don't wanna stay stagnant.

54:10.212 --> 54:12.525
Things that stay still die.

54:13.871 --> 54:16.529
You know what,
you sound like Angelo.

54:16.667 --> 54:19.773
Well, maybe Angelo
understands me more than you do.

54:23.052 --> 54:24.571
Why are you even with me?

54:26.504 --> 54:31.475
Honestly, I'm wild,
but I can't be wild 24/7.

54:32.199 --> 54:33.304
You're my balance.

54:34.581 --> 54:36.169
So I'm just a yoga pose to you?

54:36.307 --> 54:38.447
Fucking forgive me
if I'm attracted to you

54:38.585 --> 54:41.278
because you're stable as fuck,
when I'm not.

54:42.969 --> 54:44.591
- I'm sorry.
- What?

54:44.729 --> 54:45.765
What are you sorry for?

54:50.217 --> 54:53.704

for the hike?'

54:53.842 --> 54:55.084
- Yes.
- Yeah.

55:09.720 --> 55:12.516
- ''Cause you were horny.'
- 'You know what...'

55:12.654 --> 55:14.172

Rad... I'm yours.

57:33.795 --> 57:38.558
I wanna be yours.
Now, more than ever.

57:39.870 --> 57:43.149
This weekend awakened
something inside of me

57:43.287 --> 57:46.428
and I need a lover like you.

57:49.189 --> 57:51.813
I know the thought
of another man wanting me

57:51.951 --> 57:55.886
drives you crazy, and I know
you're jealous of Angelo

57:56.024 --> 57:59.096
and I know the thought
of him pleasing me

57:59.234 --> 58:00.718
drives you up the wall.

58:02.168 --> 58:05.896
But, Rad... what if I told you...

58:08.657 --> 58:09.693
...I want him?

58:11.039 --> 58:14.836
What if I told you I want him
because I need him?

58:16.251 --> 58:18.564
Why would you need him?

58:18.702 --> 58:23.465
Relax, baby,
it's just something inside me

58:23.603 --> 58:26.261
deeper, wants more.

58:27.538 --> 58:28.919
But do you even know this dude?

58:29.057 --> 58:30.679
Like...

58:30.817 --> 58:33.855
Okay, I ran him in the system

58:33.993 --> 58:37.548
and he said he's American,
but he did not show up.

58:37.686 --> 58:39.377
Really, Rad, you ran him?

58:41.207 --> 58:44.417
Yeah, look,
I had to know for sure.

58:44.555 --> 58:46.246
I needed to know
what we're dealing with here.

58:50.803 --> 58:51.873
Sorry.

58:54.392 --> 58:55.601
Love, Kayla.

58:59.087 --> 59:00.226
I need to...

59:01.607 --> 59:03.125
Do you know what I want?

59:04.782 --> 59:05.818
What?

59:07.129 --> 59:09.269
I want you to join me.

59:09.407 --> 59:11.444
I want you to try.

59:11.582 --> 59:13.273
I'm not doing this without you.

59:14.999 --> 59:16.932
So what are you saying,
are you saying

59:17.070 --> 59:18.831
you want me to fuck Glory?

59:18.969 --> 59:20.004
No.

59:21.350 --> 59:24.699
I want you to love me
so fucking much

59:24.837 --> 59:26.459
that you trust us to explore

59:26.597 --> 59:28.357
and know that
nothing will break us up.

59:29.807 --> 59:31.498
If both of us
fuck another person

59:31.637 --> 59:33.086
with each other's permission

59:33.224 --> 59:35.606
it's not gonna change
what we have.

59:36.883 --> 59:41.232
Look, baby... I love you.

59:42.199 --> 59:45.202
And it's just pleasure,
that's all.

59:45.892 --> 59:47.411
And I need pleasure.

59:47.549 --> 59:50.759
I need you to give me
pleasure in all realms.

59:57.490 --> 59:58.595
Okay.

59:59.388 --> 01:00:00.562
Okay?

01:00:01.736 --> 01:00:03.289
Yeah, I mean...

01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.051
Yeah, okay.

01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:10.192
I'm not forcing you.

01:00:10.330 --> 01:00:13.023
- I know.
- Is this what you want?

01:00:13.161 --> 01:00:14.541
Well...

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.096
If this is what you want,

01:00:17.234 --> 01:00:20.340
then it's what I want, alright?

01:00:20.478 --> 01:00:22.480
- I want to make you happy.
- Okay.

01:01:03.763 --> 01:01:05.420
This is the last night.

01:01:06.939 --> 01:01:07.974
I'll miss this.

01:03:04.194 --> 01:03:05.505
K-Kayla?

01:03:07.542 --> 01:03:08.785
Kayla?

01:03:46.961 --> 01:03:47.996
Kayla?

01:04:12.434 --> 01:04:13.677
Go ahead, it's your turn.

01:04:14.747 --> 01:04:16.197
I wouldn't do that one.

01:04:16.335 --> 01:04:18.268
'Haha. Living life on the end.'

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.961
- 'What does that say?'
- 'Three spankings from daddy.'

01:04:22.099 --> 01:04:24.757
- That's you.
- Position, please.

01:04:24.895 --> 01:04:26.966
Have you been
a good girl or a bad girl?

01:04:27.104 --> 01:04:28.312
- Bad.
- Alright.

01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:29.831
- Ahh.
- Bro, what the fuck, man?

01:04:29.969 --> 01:04:31.350
Uh-hmm. Ahh.

01:04:31.488 --> 01:04:32.799
Hey, motherfucker,
I'm talking to you.

01:04:32.938 --> 01:04:34.801
- What the hell's going on here?
- Hmm.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.769
I haven't fucked Kayla yet.

01:04:37.632 --> 01:04:39.910
Rad, what the hell?

01:04:40.048 --> 01:04:42.085
Rad, relax.

01:04:42.223 --> 01:04:44.915
- Relax, Rad.
- You can spank me too, Rad.

01:04:47.469 --> 01:04:50.093
Rad, look at me.
Look at me.

01:04:52.026 --> 01:04:53.130
Let it go.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.237
Let it... go.

01:04:58.618 --> 01:05:00.793
Rad, I think
you were getting turned on

01:05:00.931 --> 01:05:02.139
watching me spank Kayla.

01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:03.554
It's called voyeurism.

01:05:03.692 --> 01:05:04.901
What, don't gimme that shit.

01:05:05.039 --> 01:05:06.281
No, look, I know that you were

01:05:06.419 --> 01:05:08.007
watching me and Glory earlier.

01:05:08.145 --> 01:05:10.216
- It's okay, man.
- No, I didn't.

01:05:10.354 --> 01:05:11.873
That's not what I saw.

01:05:13.737 --> 01:05:14.945
Kayla, are you alright?

01:05:15.083 --> 01:05:16.257
Isn't this what you wanted?

01:05:16.395 --> 01:05:17.672
No, not like this.

01:05:17.810 --> 01:05:19.708
Rad, do you know
why you're here?

01:05:19.846 --> 01:05:21.918
Yeah, your games,
fuck your games.

01:05:23.885 --> 01:05:27.613
Rad, I've been watching you
for like a couple months.

01:05:27.751 --> 01:05:31.065
I mean, Glory didn't think
you were the one, but I did.

01:05:31.203 --> 01:05:33.757
- Don't listen to him, Rad.
- What the fuck's going on here?

01:05:33.895 --> 01:05:36.035
Kayla, can you explain to me
what's going on?

01:05:36.173 --> 01:05:37.554
Listen to Angelo.

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:41.420
Kayla, can you
fix your man a strong drink

01:05:41.558 --> 01:05:43.042
so he can chill out, please?

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.941
- I got you.
- Appreciate that.

01:05:45.079 --> 01:05:46.908
Kayla, did you fuck him?

01:05:47.046 --> 01:05:49.462
Rad, listen.

01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:53.604
Rad, our race goes
back thousands of years

01:05:53.742 --> 01:05:55.848
did you know that?
Before Christ even.

01:05:57.091 --> 01:06:00.128
We are super rare.

01:06:00.266 --> 01:06:01.750
We've been killed off.

01:06:01.888 --> 01:06:03.476
We've been hunted.

01:06:03.614 --> 01:06:05.962
Salem witch hunt,
remember that one?

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:08.826
The Inquisition, Cortés

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.139
Columbus, those animals.

01:06:11.277 --> 01:06:13.210
We've fought in wars.
We've protected.

01:06:13.348 --> 01:06:16.213
We've preserved. Uh...
Hey, the Crusades.

01:06:16.351 --> 01:06:18.112
I didn't always say
we're on the winning side

01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:19.803
and we're definitely
not perfect

01:06:19.941 --> 01:06:21.322
but we've been around.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:22.979
What are you talking about?

01:06:23.117 --> 01:06:25.153
Can I just get a straight
fucking answer here?

01:06:26.706 --> 01:06:31.021
Glory, can you be an angel
and help him out, please?

01:06:31.159 --> 01:06:33.334
Okay, come here, officer.

01:06:33.472 --> 01:06:34.542
Come sit down.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:36.716
We're gonna explain it to you.

01:06:36.854 --> 01:06:38.995
Relax, listen.

01:06:39.133 --> 01:06:40.686
For you, baby.

01:06:40.824 --> 01:06:42.515
- Hey, where was I?
- How old are we.

01:06:42.653 --> 01:06:44.000
How old are we, that's right.

01:06:44.138 --> 01:06:47.279
Well, Glory here
isn't a shade over 30

01:06:47.417 --> 01:06:49.971
and we did meet in Rome
at that swinger's party

01:06:50.109 --> 01:06:51.904
and it was a sight.

01:06:52.042 --> 01:06:54.044
Me, however, mmm...

01:06:54.182 --> 01:06:57.047
I'm a little older, thousands.

01:06:57.185 --> 01:06:58.842
I like them older.

01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:00.602
Bullshit, whatever, man.

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.156
Kayla, come on,
get your things packed.

01:07:02.294 --> 01:07:04.710
- Let's get outta here.
- Baby, just listen.

01:07:04.848 --> 01:07:07.437
- You might change your mind.
- Change my mind about what?

01:07:07.575 --> 01:07:09.542
Come on, this is crazy.
Let's get outta here.

01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:13.132
You know what really makes
our race really unique?

01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:16.998
Is it just takes one bite,
and you can become one of us.

01:07:17.136 --> 01:07:19.173
Vampires? You're telling me
you're vampires?

01:07:19.311 --> 01:07:22.141
- Come on, get real, man.
- Oh, my gosh, vampires.

01:07:22.279 --> 01:07:23.763
Rad, why do you gotta say that?

01:07:23.901 --> 01:07:25.627
Why is it,
why is it just because

01:07:25.765 --> 01:07:27.767
someone bites a neck
that we're vampires?

01:07:27.905 --> 01:07:29.321
It's such a stereotype.

01:07:29.459 --> 01:07:30.943
We don't suck blood.

01:07:31.081 --> 01:07:33.187
No, no, look,
we don't suck blood,

01:07:33.325 --> 01:07:35.154
but occasionally,
yeah, we drink it.

01:07:35.292 --> 01:07:36.776
But, look,
we can play in the sunlight.

01:07:36.914 --> 01:07:38.226
We can eat garlic.

01:07:38.364 --> 01:07:40.401
Hell, we can even
swim in holy water.

01:07:40.539 --> 01:07:42.196
Lord, really?

01:07:42.334 --> 01:07:44.715
- Yeah, what about silver?
- Fuck a silver.

01:07:44.853 --> 01:07:46.752
Now, that shit,
we don't fuck with.

01:07:46.890 --> 01:07:49.513
Yeah, fuck silver.
Platinum only, bitches.

01:07:49.651 --> 01:07:51.205
Yeah, or gold or gold.

01:07:51.343 --> 01:07:52.827
We could fuck with gold,
but fuck a silver

01:07:52.965 --> 01:07:54.518
but, look, don't worry
about our weaknesses.

01:07:54.656 --> 01:07:58.108
You should be really focused
about what we can do.

01:07:58.246 --> 01:08:01.180
We can live
for a very long time.

01:08:01.318 --> 01:08:03.631
- No more hangovers.
- Yay.

01:08:03.769 --> 01:08:04.873
No more hangovers, dude.

01:08:05.011 --> 01:08:06.530
We can drink all we want.

01:08:06.668 --> 01:08:07.980
We can do
all the drugs we want,

01:08:08.118 --> 01:08:09.982
all the debauchery
and the next morning,

01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:12.260
it's like it never
even happened.

01:08:12.398 --> 01:08:16.022
So you're a vampire
who doesn't suck blood

01:08:16.161 --> 01:08:18.335
but drinks it
and can live forever,

01:08:18.473 --> 01:08:20.303
and that doesn't ever
get any hangovers.

01:08:20.441 --> 01:08:22.236
Honestly, it doesn't sound
so amazing to me.

01:08:22.374 --> 01:08:24.134
Kayla, come on, let's go.

01:08:24.272 --> 01:08:27.137
But... you forgot
the most important part.

01:08:27.275 --> 01:08:28.449
Fuck me, I did.

01:08:28.587 --> 01:08:30.071
Rad, do you know
where the word

01:08:30.209 --> 01:08:31.452
hedonism comes from?

01:08:32.763 --> 01:08:33.868
Us.

01:08:34.869 --> 01:08:37.147
We're the reason
why that word even exist, dude.

01:08:37.285 --> 01:08:39.287
We're the origin story
of that word.

01:08:39.425 --> 01:08:42.014
- We're hedonists.
- What the fuck is a hedonist?

01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:44.154
Our race, our people, man.

01:08:44.292 --> 01:08:46.812
We're not vampires,
we're hedonists.

01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:49.987
We're the pursuers
of pleasure above all else.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.058
I mean, it's like our blood.

01:08:52.197 --> 01:08:56.097
It's our life force, man,
and we need it or we die.

01:08:56.235 --> 01:08:57.823
Fucking, touching, seeing

01:08:57.961 --> 01:09:00.688
breathing, eating,
drinking, man.

01:09:00.826 --> 01:09:02.379
Did Angelo say fucking?

01:09:02.517 --> 01:09:06.245
Because, yeah,
we need lots of that, daily.

01:09:06.383 --> 01:09:07.695
How wonderful, right?

01:09:07.833 --> 01:09:10.353
Right, dude, we need lots of sex

01:09:10.491 --> 01:09:12.251
and orgasms on top of sex.

01:09:12.389 --> 01:09:14.391
I'm talking pleasure
because if we don't have it

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:17.739
it's like we don't get air,
and we just shrivel up.

01:09:17.877 --> 01:09:19.155
So you're sex addicts.

01:09:19.293 --> 01:09:21.087
Your race is just
addicted to sex, really?

01:09:21.226 --> 01:09:24.643
No, we're more like
the naughty vampires.

01:09:25.816 --> 01:09:28.405
It's not that we are, it's why.

01:09:28.543 --> 01:09:31.028
You see all of our senses
are heightened now.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:33.238
The next time you have any food

01:09:33.376 --> 01:09:35.343
it's gonna feel like
an orgasm in your mouth.

01:09:35.481 --> 01:09:38.381
- Our eyesight is enhanced.
- No more contacts.

01:09:38.519 --> 01:09:40.452
The next time
you watch Kayla being ripped,

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:42.281
your eyes are gonna tear up.

01:09:42.419 --> 01:09:44.835
Wait, Kayla,
are you one of them already?

01:09:44.973 --> 01:09:47.838
- Did you get bit?
- It was just a little bite.

01:09:47.976 --> 01:09:49.633
- Did you bite her?
- No.

01:09:49.771 --> 01:09:51.739
I did, last night
when you were having

01:09:51.877 --> 01:09:53.637
a little bitch fit.

01:09:53.775 --> 01:09:55.398
So what happens now?

01:09:55.536 --> 01:09:57.779
You're gonna attack
and bite me, turn me into you?

01:09:57.917 --> 01:09:59.850
Or you just want me to fuck you?

01:09:59.988 --> 01:10:02.301
Kind of a good idea.

01:10:02.439 --> 01:10:04.476
Which part?
Alright, you know what?

01:10:04.614 --> 01:10:07.927
Lemme just take a second here
and wake up.

01:10:08.065 --> 01:10:09.929
What, what, what, what, what?

01:10:12.794 --> 01:10:14.969
You're all fucking crazy.

01:10:17.523 --> 01:10:20.423
Rad, I can't with you.

01:10:20.561 --> 01:10:23.460
Kayla, Glory, can you guys
be two little devils

01:10:23.598 --> 01:10:25.082
and excuse us
for a second, please?

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:27.223
Sure, I'll take this.

01:10:30.018 --> 01:10:31.227
Kayla, get packed.

01:10:32.573 --> 01:10:35.403
Rad, I'm gonna grab
my favorite bottle.

01:10:35.541 --> 01:10:36.853
Can you take a walk with me?

01:10:36.991 --> 01:10:38.889
Come on, you need to cool off.

01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:40.097
Let's make quick.

01:10:42.928 --> 01:10:45.379
Ah, man, you need to,
you need to chill out, man.

01:10:45.517 --> 01:10:48.174
- So fucking stupid, man.
- Right, you need to relax.

01:10:48.313 --> 01:10:50.453
What now, are you gonna
turn to a bat in the full moon?

01:10:50.591 --> 01:10:52.178
No, man, that's werewolves.

01:10:52.317 --> 01:10:54.457
Oh, you expect me to believe
those are real, too.

01:10:54.595 --> 01:10:57.011
Wow, vampires really?
Come on, dude, expect me--

01:10:57.149 --> 01:10:58.909
Rad, please,
stop insulting me, man.

01:10:59.047 --> 01:11:00.463
I hate that word, vampires.

01:11:00.601 --> 01:11:02.706
Look, alright,
somewhere in 11th century

01:11:02.844 --> 01:11:05.261
my uncle,
God rest his soul, right,

01:11:05.399 --> 01:11:07.573
he used to throw these
lavish fucking theme parties.

01:11:07.711 --> 01:11:10.231
He had everyone dress up
a bat and of course,

01:11:10.369 --> 01:11:12.544
what, folklore legends
start coming out about

01:11:12.682 --> 01:11:15.098
bloodsucking bats,
bloodsucking vampires.

01:11:15.236 --> 01:11:17.238
I fucking hate that shit.

01:11:17.376 --> 01:11:18.722
We're not vampires.

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:21.207
We're the origins
of vampires, right?

01:11:21.346 --> 01:11:24.280
- We're hedons aka hedonists.
- Oh, hedons. Ah, okay.

01:11:24.418 --> 01:11:26.420
We're the pursuers
of pleasure, you get it?

01:11:26.558 --> 01:11:28.594
Ah, not really, but alright.

01:11:29.354 --> 01:11:30.665
So let's just say
you're special.

01:11:32.288 --> 01:11:34.980
Is this my invite, because
I'm not joining your club.

01:11:35.118 --> 01:11:37.776
- Do you love Kayla?
- Of course. Yeah, madly.

01:11:37.914 --> 01:11:40.157
Well, she's not coming
with you then, man.

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.263
I came on this weekend trip,
you know

01:11:42.401 --> 01:11:44.990
with a girl that I finally
have a connection with

01:11:45.128 --> 01:11:47.268
someone that really,
truly understands me

01:11:47.406 --> 01:11:48.925
get me out of
my uncomfortable zone

01:11:49.063 --> 01:11:53.585
and get me out of this
24/7 cop mindset I'm always in.

01:11:53.723 --> 01:11:56.622
I come here,
I finally lower my guard

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.141
for the first time
in a long time

01:11:58.279 --> 01:12:00.419
and now,
I'm starting to lose her

01:12:00.557 --> 01:12:03.284
to this pleasure posse
you've got going on here.

01:12:03.422 --> 01:12:04.423
No, no, look, look, I know

01:12:04.561 --> 01:12:05.976
that's what it may look like

01:12:06.114 --> 01:12:07.530
on the surface, but look,

01:12:07.668 --> 01:12:09.048
I know there's been
a lot of sex going on

01:12:09.186 --> 01:12:10.429
and forgive me for that, right?

01:12:10.567 --> 01:12:11.948
Like, okay, I get it, I get it,

01:12:12.086 --> 01:12:14.191
but I've been
bullshitting with you

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:17.712
and I'm sorry, alright?
And this is the truth.

01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:20.197
Rad... I need you...

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.890
...to continue our race...

01:12:23.028 --> 01:12:24.892
...or we all die.

01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:26.480
Continue your race?

01:12:26.618 --> 01:12:29.137
You need to consider
taking over my legacy

01:12:29.275 --> 01:12:31.899
4000 years of experiences

01:12:32.037 --> 01:12:35.937
of knowledge, of heartaches,
of just everything.

01:12:36.075 --> 01:12:38.906
Intelligence is gonna be
handed to you

01:12:39.044 --> 01:12:41.391
and on top of that,
you get to be with the girl

01:12:41.529 --> 01:12:45.775
you're madly in love with
by your side forever.

01:12:45.913 --> 01:12:50.504
Imagine now, all that knowledge,
all that love forever

01:12:50.642 --> 01:12:53.714
and look, as a caveat,
on top of that, guess what?

01:12:53.852 --> 01:12:55.612
Glory, too, forever.

01:12:56.958 --> 01:12:59.616
- Threesomes forever, homie.
- Oh, okay, yeah, wow.

01:12:59.754 --> 01:13:01.411
Okay, so what is this?

01:13:01.549 --> 01:13:03.068
I mean, it sounds like
you're just trying to sell me

01:13:03.206 --> 01:13:04.380
some kind of
timeshare or something.

01:13:04.518 --> 01:13:06.105
I mean, just gonna hand me

01:13:06.243 --> 01:13:07.555
over the keys to your kingdom

01:13:07.693 --> 01:13:10.178
just like that and okay.

01:13:10.316 --> 01:13:12.526
I mean, how come
you haven't just bit me already?

01:13:12.664 --> 01:13:15.874
Fuck, Rad, relax, dude.

01:13:16.012 --> 01:13:17.703
Look, if I wanted to bite you

01:13:17.841 --> 01:13:19.395
you would die right now, why?

01:13:19.533 --> 01:13:21.845
Because you're not with this.
You don't want it.

01:13:21.983 --> 01:13:24.123
You have to want it.

01:13:24.261 --> 01:13:26.850
That's why Kayla didn't die,
because she chose it.

01:13:26.988 --> 01:13:28.024
You understand?

01:13:29.439 --> 01:13:32.200
Fuck. Alright, answer me this.

01:13:32.338 --> 01:13:33.823
- What?
- Why me?

01:13:33.961 --> 01:13:35.341
I've been trying to tell you
all weekend, man,

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.515
'cause you're a virgin.

01:13:37.792 --> 01:13:40.692
You're a virgin of life,
and if I hand you over

01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:42.556
all of my experiences
and legacy

01:13:42.694 --> 01:13:45.144
I just feel like,
because you haven't done

01:13:45.282 --> 01:13:47.975
much yet in your life
that you'll appreciate it.

01:13:49.045 --> 01:13:50.218
I'm not that much of a virgin.

01:13:50.356 --> 01:13:52.082
You could have fooled me, man.

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.567
Look, I can give it
to just anyone,

01:13:53.705 --> 01:13:55.914
but I don't want to.
It's a gift.

01:13:56.052 --> 01:13:57.881
If I give it to someone
that's already all used up

01:13:58.019 --> 01:13:59.676
they're just gonna abuse it.

01:13:59.814 --> 01:14:01.782
Look, I don't wanna
break your heart,

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.336
but the very thought
of another man

01:14:04.474 --> 01:14:06.580
biting my neck, just--

01:14:06.718 --> 01:14:09.583
- What?
- Well, it's not gonna happen.

01:14:09.721 --> 01:14:11.170
Alright, so you want me
to bite your dick?

01:14:11.308 --> 01:14:13.000
- No, neither.
- I don't either, bro.

01:14:13.138 --> 01:14:14.760
I'm just playing, I'm just
playing, but, dude, alright

01:14:14.898 --> 01:14:16.348
look, I'm not trying
to convince you, alright?

01:14:16.486 --> 01:14:18.350
I'm done, I'm done
trying to do that.

01:14:19.593 --> 01:14:21.974
And there's a second option,
right, there is.

01:14:22.112 --> 01:14:23.976
I could bite your neck,
I can kill you

01:14:24.114 --> 01:14:25.944
and drink all your blood
and I'll live another

01:14:26.082 --> 01:14:27.635
extended hundred years, right

01:14:27.773 --> 01:14:30.189
and maybe I'll find someone
and not wither away.

01:14:30.327 --> 01:14:32.433
Rad, Rad, Rad, why?
Rad, don't , don't...

01:14:32.571 --> 01:14:35.436
Fuck, why did you?
Rad, don't. Why did you do that?

01:14:35.574 --> 01:14:37.058
- Mm.
- Why'd you do that?

01:14:37.196 --> 01:14:39.129
Why not?

01:14:39.267 --> 01:14:41.338
That's my blood in there, man.
What are you doing?

01:14:43.893 --> 01:14:45.101
You fucking kidding me, man?

01:14:45.239 --> 01:14:46.930
- I'm not.
- Jesus.

01:14:47.068 --> 01:14:48.587
- What?
- Dude, fuck you, man.

01:14:48.725 --> 01:14:50.796
This is rid... You know what?
We're outta here.

01:14:50.934 --> 01:14:52.729
- Rad.
- Goddammit.

01:14:52.867 --> 01:14:53.937
Rad!

01:14:56.561 --> 01:14:58.839
Don't drink and drive, Rad.

01:15:00.185 --> 01:15:02.014
Fuck, fuck.

01:15:10.747 --> 01:15:13.267
Kayla, fucking vampires

01:15:13.405 --> 01:15:14.579
Kayla, you...

Wait from him or...

01:18:42.614 --> 01:18:43.926
I think we should
just go for it.

01:18:44.064 --> 01:18:45.134
Alright, so fuck it.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:00.459

Okay.

Oh, my gosh. Kayla.

'911, what's your emergency.'

01:21:42.621 --> 01:21:43.899
There's been a shooting.

01:21:45.210 --> 01:21:48.904
Just send everybody
to this GPS on my phone.

01:21:49.042 --> 01:21:51.907
'Hello, hello?'

01:22:08.199 --> 01:22:10.856
Jesus, bro, really?

01:22:10.995 --> 01:22:12.858
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:16.276
Really, I was about to give you
the keys to the kingdom

01:22:16.414 --> 01:22:18.071
and you're gonna shoot me?

01:22:18.209 --> 01:22:19.935
You're gonna shoot everyone?

01:22:20.073 --> 01:22:22.799
Oh, my gosh,
are you that dumb?

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:25.871
I mean, really, man. Come on.

01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:29.323
You shot me, Rad.
Really, Rad?

01:22:29.461 --> 01:22:30.704
You shot me.

01:22:32.085 --> 01:22:34.466
- How are you guys alive?
- Wow, officer.

01:22:34.604 --> 01:22:36.744
You really didn't wanna fuck me.

01:22:39.713 --> 01:22:41.749
On to the bed,
come on, come here.

01:22:41.887 --> 01:22:43.441
- I got him. Sit him up.
- You're not going anywhere.

01:22:43.579 --> 01:22:45.132
I don't really wanna hear him.
You know what, Rad?

01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:48.032
All you had to do
was open your mind

01:22:48.170 --> 01:22:49.930
but you couldn't even do that,
could you?

01:22:50.068 --> 01:22:51.897
Right, you could have
lived forever

01:22:52.036 --> 01:22:53.934
and now,
I gotta drink your blood.

01:22:54.072 --> 01:22:56.592
I didn't wanna drink
your blood, dude,

01:22:56.730 --> 01:23:00.078
but now, I have to.
Fuck me, it's tragic.

01:23:00.216 --> 01:23:02.287
We could have lived
together forever, baby.

01:23:03.530 --> 01:23:04.910
Yeah, whatever.

01:23:05.049 --> 01:23:07.396
Hey, man, uh,
do you want a safety word?

01:23:07.534 --> 01:23:10.157
You know what, fuck it.
You don't even deserve one.

01:23:27.588 --> 01:23:28.693
