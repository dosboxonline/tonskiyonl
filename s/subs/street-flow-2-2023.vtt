00:54.708 --> 00:56.250
Hey, how are you? Doing well?

00:56.333 --> 00:57.166
I'm good.

01:24.208 --> 01:25.041
Follow me.

01:26.125 --> 01:27.000
-Welcome.
-Thanks.

02:33.166 --> 02:34.166
Are you okay?

02:34.250 --> 02:35.750
-I'm fine. You?
-I'm fine.

02:37.375 --> 02:39.375
What is this? What happened to you?

02:39.458 --> 02:40.833
It's nothing. I fell.

02:40.916 --> 02:42.416
What do you mean, you fell?

02:42.916 --> 02:43.916
I just fell.

02:49.458 --> 02:50.291
He says hi.

04:07.791 --> 04:09.250
Come on!

04:09.750 --> 04:13.625
Hurry up. I've been asking you
to do this for five minutes.

04:13.708 --> 04:15.125
Hey, in the back!

04:15.791 --> 04:16.708
Come in.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.416
He's always late!

04:24.500 --> 04:26.583
-8:40 a.m.?
-Public transit, miss.

04:27.083 --> 04:31.000
Do you have your own public transit?
You're the only one who is late.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.750
-Do you know what "public" means?
-What "public" means?

04:34.833 --> 04:36.375
Transit for a guy in misery?

04:37.125 --> 04:38.458
-He's right.
-No.

04:38.541 --> 04:41.583
It means for everyone. Shared among many.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.125
Get your things out.

04:44.791 --> 04:47.583
"The street about me
roared with a deafening sound."

04:47.666 --> 04:49.083
So put in your AirPods.

04:50.375 --> 04:53.333
-"And there, in the middle of the crowd…"
-A chick.

04:53.416 --> 04:57.625
A chick.
Tall, slender, and sadly beautiful.

04:57.708 --> 04:58.916
Sadly hot.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.583
Yeah!

05:00.666 --> 05:02.625
Hey, okay! Enough.

05:03.208 --> 05:04.458
He was so thirsty.

05:04.541 --> 05:06.666
Baudelaire is a Symbolist poet.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.958
Miss, we don't care about Baudelaire.

05:09.041 --> 05:11.750
Can't you tell us
about stuff from our century?

05:12.291 --> 05:14.166
-Like who?
-I don't know, Niro?

05:14.250 --> 05:16.208
-Ninho, miss!
-Or Kalash Criminel!

05:18.791 --> 05:23.250
We can think about it, but today,
we're reading To a Passerby by Baudelaire.

05:23.958 --> 05:25.500
The poem speaks of love.

05:25.583 --> 05:29.791
That's a universal subject.
Has it never happened to you?

05:29.875 --> 05:33.000
You're waiting for the RER.
You see someone, and you think,

05:33.083 --> 05:36.625
"Maybe we could have had
an amazing love story."

05:36.708 --> 05:39.583
Not to me. If I see a chick I like,
I go get her Snap.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.291
You get it.

05:41.958 --> 05:43.750
You're a player, man.

05:43.833 --> 05:46.875
Shut up. Whose Snap
are you gonna get with that face?

05:48.750 --> 05:50.500
He's jealous because he's ugly.

05:51.125 --> 05:53.416
He's not going to get one Snap. It's sad.

05:53.500 --> 05:55.666
Fuck you. You think I'm your buddy?

05:55.750 --> 05:57.750
-Watch your language, Anis.
-My language?

05:57.833 --> 06:00.291
He's been disrupting the class.
Now it's my fault?

06:00.375 --> 06:03.166
Miss, let it go.
That's how Aviateurs guys are.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.166
They talk a lot,
but when it goes down, they run.

06:05.250 --> 06:07.375
Run? Run from what?

06:07.458 --> 06:09.500
-I said, you run!
-Boys, stop!

06:11.375 --> 06:12.750
You run away!

06:17.625 --> 06:20.208
Fuck you! You're putting on a show!

06:20.291 --> 06:22.125
-Let's go outside!
-Let's go outside!

06:22.208 --> 06:25.083
-Noumouké!
-Let him. He's putting on a show.

06:25.166 --> 06:27.625
You show up late,
then you start acting out?

06:28.166 --> 06:32.083
Keep your head down. Calm down, okay?
Both of you go to the principal's office.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.125
-Mr. Delors?
-Yes?

06:42.208 --> 06:45.041
Mr. Mercier is ready to see you.
Would you please follow me?

06:45.125 --> 06:45.958
Yes.

06:50.916 --> 06:52.333
-Mr. Mercier?
-Yes.

06:52.416 --> 06:53.625
Mr. Delors is here.

06:53.708 --> 06:54.541
Hello.

06:55.291 --> 06:58.625
Mr. Mercier, this is Mr. Traoré.
He's my sales manager.

06:59.333 --> 07:00.666
Hello, Mr. Traoré.

07:00.750 --> 07:01.583
Hello.

07:01.666 --> 07:02.708
Look, Mr. Delors.

07:02.791 --> 07:05.625
Your company has experience
in the building trades.

07:05.708 --> 07:09.916
We've looked at your balance sheet,
which was quite impressive for 2019.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.708
It's two years since
we opened the insulation division.

07:13.208 --> 07:15.541
An initiative of our sales manager,
Mr. Traoré.

07:16.916 --> 07:19.083
He's the boss. His wish is my command.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.625
He's not full of himself either?

07:21.708 --> 07:22.791
No.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.500
Let's get straight to the point.

07:25.208 --> 07:29.166
How many gigs do you produce a month?
What? 150? 200?

07:29.250 --> 07:30.166
200 gigs.

07:31.166 --> 07:33.875
-We'll need one tera by next month.
-That's 1,000 gigs.

07:34.416 --> 07:35.250
We can do it.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.875
The ones before you said they could do it.

07:39.958 --> 07:43.625
But they didn't convince you.
Otherwise, we wouldn't be here.

07:43.708 --> 07:47.125
Do you know what that means?
You'll need five times more customers.

07:47.208 --> 07:51.000
Five times more sales representatives,
labor, trucks, materials,

07:51.083 --> 07:53.291
and most of all,
five times more investment.

07:53.375 --> 07:56.916
And you would need five companies
the size of Mr. Delors'.

07:57.458 --> 08:00.083
That means
five times more intermediaries, risk,

08:00.166 --> 08:02.791
and perhaps, in the end,
five times more problems.

08:05.458 --> 08:07.208
I'm sure you have enough problems.

08:13.916 --> 08:14.916
What is this?

08:15.500 --> 08:18.166
-We noticed that you're a soccer fan.
-Well, yes.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.708
This comes with no obligation.

08:21.208 --> 08:23.791
No? Presidential suite?

08:23.875 --> 08:25.666
You should have started with that.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.916
-It's in the bag.
-Don't get carried away. It's not done.

08:31.708 --> 08:35.208
If it does work out,
I still need to find trucks, salesmen,

08:35.708 --> 08:36.875
and even a call center.

08:38.083 --> 08:39.333
Anyway, if it works out,

08:40.708 --> 08:42.583
you're going to double your revenue.

08:43.333 --> 08:44.166
And?

08:46.583 --> 08:48.083
I'd like a little raise.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.125
Remember when you came from Belgium
without a penny to your name?

08:54.708 --> 08:55.583
What did you say?

08:56.125 --> 08:57.875
Find me something. Give me work.

08:57.958 --> 08:58.958
Do you remember?

08:59.041 --> 09:02.875
Now you get 3,000 euros a month
just to put your name on some papers,

09:02.958 --> 09:04.125
and you want a raise?

09:04.708 --> 09:05.750
Get out of the car.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.333
-Demba, come on.
-Get out of the car!

09:10.916 --> 09:13.166
-It's far.
-I said, get out of the car!

09:15.333 --> 09:16.750
Hurry up, for fuck's sake!

09:17.333 --> 09:18.166
Okay.

09:18.666 --> 09:20.500
You'll end up with nothing!

09:22.083 --> 09:24.000
-You're gonna leave me here?
-Shut up.

09:55.458 --> 09:56.666
Careful, Rime!

10:02.708 --> 10:03.708
Let's go!

10:05.583 --> 10:06.791
Come on, let's go!

10:33.541 --> 10:34.375
Yes, come in.

10:35.875 --> 10:36.708
Yes, I'll be late.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.458
I can't be in two places at once.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.083
I'll call you back.

10:43.458 --> 10:44.375
I'll call you back.

10:48.541 --> 10:50.958
Soulaymaan, what can I do for you?

10:54.208 --> 10:55.708
I'm tired of preparing drafts.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.916
It's part of the job.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.291
I know, but I didn't become an attorney
to do that.

11:01.791 --> 11:04.958
I want to plead, to work with clients.
A real attorney.

11:05.041 --> 11:07.041
You're an associate in this firm.

11:07.125 --> 11:11.041
Nothing is stopping you from
pleading for your own clients in court.

11:11.125 --> 11:12.000
Come on.

11:13.041 --> 11:14.458
You're drowning us in work.

11:14.958 --> 11:17.208
Even if I took my own clients,

11:17.291 --> 11:19.500
I'd never find the time to attend to them.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.791
You are compensated in return.

11:22.916 --> 11:25.416
You're welcome
to put an end to this collaboration.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.166
Young lawyers are lining up at the door.

11:37.750 --> 11:38.583
Soulaymaan.

11:40.083 --> 11:42.500
Go visit our clients in the Fleury Prison.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.583
You want to work with clients, right?

11:45.666 --> 11:47.500
That's not what I had in mind.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.625
Well, it's that or drafts.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.375
Of course, be reassuring.

11:51.458 --> 11:55.291
Tell them that the case is moving forward.
That you're going to talk to the judge.

11:56.625 --> 11:59.000
Yes? I was going to call you back.

12:07.125 --> 12:09.583
-Are you good? All right?
-Yeah, you? Chilling.

12:10.625 --> 12:11.458
So?

12:12.041 --> 12:15.250
Demba, hook me up
with your guy at the Port of Le Havre.

12:15.333 --> 12:16.833
I'm going to get my own stuff.

12:18.041 --> 12:21.000
I'm not involved anymore.
I don't want to be seen with them.

12:21.500 --> 12:24.083
If you stop taking Abdel's stuff,
you'll be in trouble.

12:24.750 --> 12:28.625
-I don't want my name to come up.
-Who is Abdel? I do what I want.

12:28.708 --> 12:31.375
There's no godfather or whatever.
This isn't Italy.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.750
You know how much he makes
with Sahli's turf?

12:34.333 --> 12:37.166
He supplies all of Val-de-Marne,
and I can't get my own stuff?

12:37.250 --> 12:38.208
Come on, brother.

12:40.333 --> 12:41.791
I'm gonna tell you something.

12:43.125 --> 12:45.291
It was Abdel who told me this.

12:45.375 --> 12:48.291
"On the streets, there are
two kinds of people who don't last."

12:48.375 --> 12:50.625
"An old-timer underestimating
a young guy's greed."

12:50.708 --> 12:53.166
"A young guy underestimating
an old-timer's experience."

12:54.791 --> 12:55.791
You understand?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.375
Okay, Demba. See you later.

13:06.541 --> 13:07.666
What did he say?

13:07.750 --> 13:09.333
He's underestimating my greed.

13:09.958 --> 13:11.625
Fuck him and Abdel.

13:11.708 --> 13:15.291
-No. Don't say that, bruh.
-What? Are you with them or with me?

13:16.375 --> 13:17.583
It's not about that.

13:17.666 --> 13:20.666
When I had trouble with guys from Auber,
Demba stuck his neck out for me.

13:20.750 --> 13:21.916
You can't forget that.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.083
I got it. He's your big brother. Fine.

13:27.166 --> 13:28.000
Your plate.

13:28.083 --> 13:30.583
-I'm good, Mom.
-No, eat a bit more.

13:30.666 --> 13:31.750
A little bit, then.

13:33.583 --> 13:34.791
That's a little bit?

13:35.375 --> 13:36.208
Eat.

13:36.791 --> 13:38.000
That's not a little bit.

13:46.208 --> 13:48.041
She's getting married soon.

13:48.125 --> 13:49.750
Binta's daughter is getting married?

13:50.250 --> 13:51.458
How old is she?

13:51.541 --> 13:52.500
She's 22.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.000
I was married at 18.

13:55.083 --> 13:55.958
Right.

13:56.541 --> 14:00.083
Ma, do you have someone for Soulaymaan?
A chick without teeth.

14:01.666 --> 14:02.541
Stop it.

14:03.750 --> 14:06.750
If Soulaymaan was ready,
I'd get him a woman tomorrow.

14:07.416 --> 14:09.500
A lot of moms have asked me.

14:09.583 --> 14:11.250
-A lot of moms?
-A lot.

14:12.666 --> 14:13.583
Okay.

14:13.666 --> 14:17.541
He's not into that. He's going to bring
a very white, blue-eyed blonde.

14:17.625 --> 14:18.666
That's what he's into.

14:19.833 --> 14:22.458
There's the daughter of the cousin--

14:22.541 --> 14:24.875
The cousin of your aunt,

Her daughter-in-law who…

14:29.625 --> 14:30.875
It's fine. Thank you.

14:32.375 --> 14:34.458
Are you making fun of your poor mother?

14:34.541 --> 14:36.583
No, Mom. I have a career to build.

14:37.291 --> 14:40.500
It's not everything to have a family.
You have to be able to afford it.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.333
Soulaymaan, your father wasn't a lawyer.

14:43.416 --> 14:48.166
You've always had a roof over your head,
food and drink, and clothes.

15:06.708 --> 15:09.125
-Is that it?

17:35.250 --> 17:37.375
Stop! Give me your hands!

17:37.458 --> 17:38.958
You're hurting me! Let go of me!

18:19.208 --> 18:20.333
I can hold it.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.500
-Give it. I'll--
-Stop it!

18:23.041 --> 18:26.125
Sofia, Demba was there.
He stopped me. I couldn't leave.

18:29.375 --> 18:30.750
You think I was scared?

18:31.750 --> 18:33.333
You think I was scared or what?

18:34.250 --> 18:36.250
You'll see what I'm going to do to them.

18:39.416 --> 18:41.625
Hang on. It's that son of a bitch, Anis.

18:41.708 --> 18:43.083
You bitches!

18:43.166 --> 18:45.333
We have to wait. They'll be expecting us.

18:45.416 --> 18:46.291
You'll see.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.208
Trust me.

18:48.708 --> 18:49.916
Let me hold it for you.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.000
The projects

19:11.458 --> 19:14.000
They had the nerve to raid the projects

19:14.541 --> 19:17.166
I'll show them that I can be bad too

19:17.875 --> 19:20.500
And I won't need my big brother for that

19:21.166 --> 19:23.875
Give me a piece
And I'll even leave them on the ground

19:26.125 --> 19:27.250
On the ground

19:47.333 --> 19:48.166
When?

19:48.666 --> 19:49.625
Tomorrow morning.

19:51.083 --> 19:53.833
-How much?
-Ten kilos of hash and two kilos of coke.

19:54.333 --> 19:55.541
Where is the pickup?

19:56.458 --> 19:57.333
The usual.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.250
You're sure he'll be there?

20:03.291 --> 20:04.250
Yeah, I'm sure.

20:05.000 --> 20:05.833
Farid.

20:06.666 --> 20:08.250
If you're jerking me around…

20:09.875 --> 20:10.875
Look at me.

20:11.666 --> 20:12.750
I won't let it go.

20:16.708 --> 20:17.583
Hey.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.583
-You got me?
-I got you.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.166
Show your hands!

21:05.791 --> 21:06.875
Mr. Abdel.

21:10.166 --> 21:12.291
What's going on? You're surprised?

21:14.125 --> 21:15.125
All this for me?

21:17.958 --> 21:19.833
That's right. All this for you.

21:34.625 --> 21:36.166
An apple a day

21:36.958 --> 21:38.458
keeps the doctor away.

21:40.916 --> 21:42.083
You're cocky, eh?

21:42.166 --> 21:45.750
On my mother's life, I'll get you.
Don't worry. You piece of shit.

21:48.833 --> 21:50.625
We're missing some completion notices.

21:50.708 --> 21:52.416
I did it. It's in order.

21:53.041 --> 21:55.500
Rime has been asking for them for a week.

21:56.500 --> 21:57.625
You see her?

21:57.708 --> 21:59.041
She acts on my behalf.

21:59.125 --> 22:00.416
-Okay, boss.
-Okay.

22:00.500 --> 22:01.708
Your cousin is here.

22:01.791 --> 22:04.458
Let him in. Never make Doums wait.

22:04.541 --> 22:06.166
Bring me the notices, guys.

22:06.958 --> 22:08.916
I'm getting the truck. I'll bring them.

22:09.583 --> 22:11.666
"I'm getting the truck. I'll bring them."

22:12.458 --> 22:15.333
-He heard you, you crazy fool.
-What is he gonna do?

22:15.416 --> 22:17.375
You work with undocumented workers.

22:17.875 --> 22:21.083
-They're absolute machines.
-I'm gonna rat you out to the URSSAF.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.541
Hire some guys from the projects.

22:24.625 --> 22:27.166
All they do is complain
and ask for raises.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.625
That's called integration.

22:29.708 --> 22:32.458
That's assimilation, not integration.

22:32.541 --> 22:34.791
You can't tell
guys from the projects a thing.

22:35.958 --> 22:37.166
You're making a killing.

22:37.250 --> 22:38.833
Appearances can be deceiving.

22:38.916 --> 22:40.916
I've had one struggle after another.

22:41.416 --> 22:45.958
That said, sitting in an office all day,
checking on employees,

22:47.166 --> 22:48.416
that's not for me.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.791
You spend hours overseeing a trap house.

22:50.875 --> 22:51.958
I saw that coming.

23:03.041 --> 23:04.666
I miss Samir, that bastard.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.958
Demba!

23:18.333 --> 23:20.875
Watch out!

23:49.750 --> 23:51.000
Are you really done?

23:55.958 --> 23:57.416
Do you know what insanity is?

23:58.875 --> 24:02.916
Insanity is always doing the same thing
and expecting different results.

24:04.666 --> 24:06.083
Stop philosophizing.

24:07.083 --> 24:08.333
Come on. Come here.

24:08.416 --> 24:09.250
Hello.

24:09.833 --> 24:11.041
-Hello.
-How are you?

24:15.166 --> 24:16.250
Are you kidding me?

24:17.833 --> 24:19.333
I've been struggling for an hour.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.916
You're looking for trouble. Turn that off.

24:24.125 --> 24:24.958
Get up.

24:26.541 --> 24:27.416
Get up.

24:30.458 --> 24:33.666
I had to fight the principal
to prevent you from being expelled.

24:33.750 --> 24:35.750
Even for you to be allowed
on school grounds.

24:38.500 --> 24:39.458
Come sit down.

24:41.791 --> 24:43.083
You're gonna read this.

24:46.333 --> 24:48.958
Noumouké, you're gonna read this book

24:49.041 --> 24:51.625
and write me an essay
about how it made you feel.

24:51.708 --> 24:54.500
I don't want an analysis.
I want to know what you felt.

24:55.500 --> 24:58.083
Miss, the truth is,
that doesn't interest me much.

24:58.166 --> 25:00.208
Oh yeah? And how do you know that?

25:00.291 --> 25:01.416
I know myself well.

25:02.458 --> 25:04.375
The hardest part is starting.

25:04.875 --> 25:07.083
I promise you
that you'll lose track of time.

25:09.791 --> 25:11.166
What's this thing about?

25:12.041 --> 25:13.416
It's the story of Martin Eden.

25:13.500 --> 25:15.875
No, really? Doesn't it say Martin Eden?

25:17.375 --> 25:21.250
It's about a guy who doesn't like to read
and spends his time fighting.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.500
Remind you of someone?

25:23.625 --> 25:24.500
And you?

25:25.375 --> 25:29.083
One day, Martin Eden defends
someone in a fight. A very rich man.

25:29.166 --> 25:30.916
The rich man has a sister.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
Martin Eden falls in love with her.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.791
But the sister is upper class.
She's educated, rich.

25:36.875 --> 25:39.458
So Martin Eden tells himself
he'll educate himself.

25:39.541 --> 25:40.875
He'll read every book.

25:40.958 --> 25:42.916
And once he's like her,

25:43.875 --> 25:45.750
she'll fall in love with him.

25:48.250 --> 25:49.708
You think I'm Martin Eden?

25:50.375 --> 25:52.708
You think I'm going to read
to seduce a chick?

25:52.791 --> 25:54.625
You've never fought to impress a girl?

25:58.125 --> 25:59.458
So, does he get with her?

26:00.125 --> 26:01.583
-What?
-Stop playing.

26:01.666 --> 26:04.000
In the end, does he get with the chick?

26:23.958 --> 26:26.500
-Where are you headed?
-Nanterre.

26:26.583 --> 26:27.625
That's far.

26:27.708 --> 26:29.125
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

26:29.208 --> 26:31.250
-Good evening, Djenaba.
-Good evening.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.958
And you? Choisy?

26:33.791 --> 26:35.875
-No, Vitry.
-She has to pick up her son.

26:36.375 --> 26:37.291
You have a son.

26:38.291 --> 26:40.541
Yes. Idrissa. He's ten years old.

26:41.416 --> 26:45.041
You're going from here to Vitry,
Vitry to Choisy, on public transit?

26:45.125 --> 26:47.375
That's how it is
raising a child on your own.

26:49.375 --> 26:50.791
I can take you partway.

26:59.708 --> 27:01.958
You surprised me
with that meeting with Arcus.

27:02.500 --> 27:04.375
I've been trying to get one for ages.

27:05.000 --> 27:06.958
Where were you working before this?

27:07.041 --> 27:08.916
I haven't worked for two years.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.583
Wow. Why is that?

27:11.416 --> 27:13.500
I started wearing the veil two years ago.

27:16.583 --> 27:19.291
And you, sir?
What did you do before insulation?

27:19.375 --> 27:20.208
Me?

27:21.166 --> 27:22.750
Always the construction industry.

27:23.791 --> 27:26.291
You don't have to call me "sir."
I'm not 50 years old.

27:27.125 --> 27:28.250
I can't do it.

27:28.333 --> 27:29.166
Why not?

27:30.583 --> 27:31.416
I don't know.

27:32.333 --> 27:34.125
It's not like you're that young.

27:37.833 --> 27:38.666
I'm joking.

27:41.666 --> 27:42.916
Stop acting crazy.

27:47.333 --> 27:50.000
-You played me real good!
-Calm down! What's going on?

27:50.500 --> 27:52.625
Why would I do that?
I want Abdel to fall too.

27:52.708 --> 27:54.708
-How would he have known?
-No clue. Your colleagues?

27:54.791 --> 27:55.958
Stop your bullshit.

27:56.041 --> 27:59.250
You think everybody is
into double-crossing like you?

27:59.333 --> 28:00.583
I warned you, Farid.

28:00.666 --> 28:03.791
I'm not letting you out of my sight.
I'm going to be a leech.

28:03.875 --> 28:05.875
I'm going to eat Farid, sleep Farid,

28:05.958 --> 28:07.666
and when I fuck, I'll fuck Farid.

28:07.750 --> 28:09.791
It won't stop until you go down. Trust me.

28:10.291 --> 28:11.541
Shut up! Don't touch me!

28:12.166 --> 28:14.000
Stop getting angry for nothing.

28:14.875 --> 28:16.458
This is my turf, I swear!

28:17.166 --> 28:19.666
If I were you, I'd keep a low profile.

28:20.333 --> 28:21.166
You know why?

28:21.250 --> 28:23.500
Because Abdel probably knows
it came from you.

28:23.583 --> 28:25.916
What did you tell him? Huh?

28:27.291 --> 28:29.916
You fucking bitch!
What did you tell him? Huh?

28:31.833 --> 28:35.000
The chambermaids at the Hotel Ibis
in Batignolles are on strike.

28:35.083 --> 28:37.916
They're protesting their work conditions
and low wages.

28:38.000 --> 28:41.208
Among their demands,
they mention the unequal treatment

28:41.291 --> 28:44.583
of subcontractors and salaried employees.

28:50.916 --> 28:52.208
Turn it down.

28:52.291 --> 28:54.000
They've been showing the same thing.

28:54.083 --> 28:56.000
"They've been showing the same thing…"

28:56.083 --> 28:57.875
You've been watching the same shit too.

28:58.625 --> 29:00.833
I'm going to bed.
There's nothing to do here.

29:01.333 --> 29:02.666
He's offended.

29:02.750 --> 29:03.791
Okay, Mr. Lawyer.

29:04.291 --> 29:05.625
You're really going to sleep?

29:06.125 --> 29:09.375
Yeah, I am. I'm dead.
Miss Saadi made me read all day.

29:09.458 --> 29:10.791
What book?

29:10.875 --> 29:12.541
Martin Eden by Jack London.

29:13.583 --> 29:17.000
"On the library shelves,
I saw a world emerge on the horizon."

29:17.500 --> 29:19.708
-You read it?
-Yeah, I read it.

29:20.666 --> 29:22.166
You know it by heart?

29:22.250 --> 29:25.125
No, I don't know it by heart.
I only know a few quotes.

29:25.625 --> 29:29.375
It always sounds good to add
one or two quotations to a defense speech.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.041
All that to seem French.

29:33.875 --> 29:36.083
What do you mean, "to seem French"?

29:36.583 --> 29:38.125
I don't want to be uncultured.

29:52.250 --> 29:55.791
"He who speaks the language
of a people avoids its evil."

30:25.541 --> 30:26.416
Hello.

30:26.958 --> 30:27.833
Hello.

30:30.583 --> 30:31.416
Hello.

30:44.291 --> 30:47.291
He's asking us
to provide one tera by next month.

30:49.041 --> 30:50.416
We don't have enough staff…

30:50.500 --> 30:51.333
DINNER?

30:54.208 --> 30:55.416
I DON'T KNOW…

30:55.500 --> 30:58.125
You should ask the big boss. Demba?

30:58.625 --> 30:59.541
Demba?

31:01.083 --> 31:02.833
We're going to grow the team.

31:02.916 --> 31:05.000
We'll have to train the new people.

31:05.541 --> 31:07.791
We'll use a second call center in Morocco.

31:08.291 --> 31:09.125
THAT'S NOT A NO…

31:09.208 --> 31:11.708
We're not sending you out to battle
without any weapons.

31:11.791 --> 31:13.750
-How are you, Ma?
-I'm good, Soulaymaan.

31:13.833 --> 31:14.666
Can I try?

31:15.291 --> 31:17.791
Mama. Come on. Just a little bit.

31:21.250 --> 31:23.083
It's for my charity.

31:23.166 --> 31:25.041
You know I love your bissap.

31:25.125 --> 31:27.250
If you like the bissap, pay for it.

31:36.250 --> 31:37.291
How is it going?

31:40.000 --> 31:41.791
I'm at the preface. It's moving along.

31:42.541 --> 31:43.375
Do you like it?

31:44.041 --> 31:47.416
If you're trying to tell me
I need to become a nerd to make it,

31:47.500 --> 31:48.791
I think I get it.

31:49.541 --> 31:50.541
Right, can I go?

31:53.333 --> 31:54.500
Bye, miss.

31:55.333 --> 31:56.958
-You're not taking the book?
-No.

31:57.458 --> 31:59.416
I'm not bringing it home unless I have to.

32:05.833 --> 32:06.708
Traoré.

32:10.125 --> 32:12.916
-That's how you greet me?
-I don't have friends in the police.

32:13.000 --> 32:18.333
I know. Mr. Demba Traoré isn't a snitch.
I hear you're in the insulation business?

32:19.166 --> 32:23.125
-You're going to arrest me for that?
-No. What I'm interested in is narcotics.

32:23.625 --> 32:25.041
I'm not involved.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.666
What are you trying to do here? Tell me.

32:29.166 --> 32:32.416
You're trying to start a new life?
It's the new Demba, is that it?

32:34.500 --> 32:36.000
Do you remember June 28, 2018?

32:37.916 --> 32:39.625
On the day they tried to kill you,

32:40.333 --> 32:44.666
guess whose phone pinged
in the same area Sahli was in?

32:46.583 --> 32:47.875
You don't like guessing games?

32:47.958 --> 32:51.166
You're trying to tell me
Abdou was involved? I knew that.

32:51.250 --> 32:52.083
No.

32:52.791 --> 32:54.708
Abdou and Sahli were tight.

32:55.250 --> 32:58.083
But between you and me,
you think they did that on their own?

32:58.166 --> 33:01.041
Those two? Demba, who ended Sahli?

33:01.125 --> 33:03.541
Who took over Sahli's trap house
when he got killed?

33:04.500 --> 33:06.958
Who's dealing to Farid now
that you're out of the game?

33:07.458 --> 33:08.291
Here.

33:08.375 --> 33:09.708
I don't want it.

33:10.458 --> 33:12.416
They're photos from a surveillance camera.

33:12.500 --> 33:14.666
They were together on the same day.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.750
You want to use me
to get rid of your enemies?

33:18.833 --> 33:21.750
No. You're not a murderer, Demba.

33:21.833 --> 33:23.916
You're in the insulation business, right?

33:26.666 --> 33:29.958
It wasn't easy to get these photos.
Take the time to look at them.

34:12.291 --> 34:13.875
I can't believe it!

34:13.958 --> 34:16.041
-He got Assia's Snap!
-Stop it.

34:17.000 --> 34:21.500
You got Assia's Snap! That's nasty!

34:22.083 --> 34:23.083
Nasty.

34:23.958 --> 34:25.791
Aren't they the guys from Aviateurs?

34:26.416 --> 34:29.958
Hey! The guys from Aviateurs
are at the bus stop.

34:30.041 --> 34:32.000
-Who?
-The guys from Aviateurs.

34:32.083 --> 34:33.708
Take this.

34:35.333 --> 34:37.750
Let's go, guys. Let's go. Let's get off.

34:40.083 --> 34:42.041
Are you shaking?

34:42.125 --> 34:43.250
What's up?

34:43.333 --> 34:44.916
Hey, come here!

34:45.000 --> 34:46.833
Hey, he's going down! Down!

34:46.916 --> 34:49.250
Stop running! I won't hurt you!

34:52.166 --> 34:55.500
You'll see, you son of a bitch!
What's up, you son of a bitch?

34:55.583 --> 34:56.833
Let go of me.

34:56.916 --> 34:58.500
What's up, you son of a bitch?

34:58.583 --> 35:00.375
Remember me, you son of a bitch?

35:00.458 --> 35:02.791
Look at me, you son of a bitch!
Remember me?

35:03.708 --> 35:05.958
Film it! That's how it is in Bois-l'Abbé.

35:06.041 --> 35:07.375
We kick your asses!

35:07.458 --> 35:08.416
You son of a bitch.

35:08.500 --> 35:09.791
You bitches.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.250
-Let's go.
-You little shit.

35:14.791 --> 35:16.416
This place is wonderful.

35:16.500 --> 35:18.000
Didn't I tell you you'd enjoy it?

35:18.083 --> 35:20.916
-You can be sure I'll come back.
-No "sir"?

35:21.000 --> 35:22.708
It's the first time.

35:31.250 --> 35:32.125
Thank you.

35:42.458 --> 35:43.708
Can I ask you a question?

35:44.416 --> 35:45.250
Yes.

35:47.791 --> 35:49.250
Since you know religion well…

35:49.333 --> 35:52.833
Hold on. It's not because I wear the veil
that I know religion well.

35:52.916 --> 35:55.791
Okay, don't be so humble.
You know the basics.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.291
Yes. The very basics.

36:03.416 --> 36:04.958
You know, in religion,

36:06.000 --> 36:08.250
from what I know,

36:09.166 --> 36:10.666
all sins can be repented.

36:12.791 --> 36:13.625
Yes.

36:15.750 --> 36:17.125
Even when you kill someone?

36:20.250 --> 36:21.625
Why are you asking me this?

36:22.583 --> 36:24.833
Don't freak out. It's not for me. It's…

36:25.750 --> 36:30.375
Someone asked me, and so, you know,
I'm asking you because you'll know.

36:30.458 --> 36:32.166
I don't want to tell him nonsense.

36:34.166 --> 36:37.250
In religion, all sins can be repented
as long as you're alive.

36:37.791 --> 36:40.583
But the sin of murder is
one of the biggest sins.

36:41.083 --> 36:42.041
You should know that.

36:42.916 --> 36:45.708
Yeah, I know that.
I told you that it wasn't for me.

36:47.958 --> 36:49.125
Can I take these?

36:49.208 --> 36:50.541
-Yes.
-Sure.

37:12.125 --> 37:14.500
Soulaymaan,
you're going to plead in court.

37:15.041 --> 37:17.208
A case was brought up
for immediate arraignment.

37:17.291 --> 37:19.333
Neither Perrier nor I can go.

37:19.416 --> 37:21.041
My secretary has emailed you.

37:22.333 --> 37:23.208
It's time.

37:50.208 --> 37:51.041
Hello.

37:51.583 --> 37:52.625
Mr. Traoré.

37:54.166 --> 37:55.375
You're the attorney?

37:56.375 --> 37:58.041
Who else could it be?

38:02.250 --> 38:03.083
You're young.

38:03.750 --> 38:06.250
Mr. Millet, I'm going to get you released.

38:06.333 --> 38:08.791
How? I confessed to everything
while I was in custody.

38:08.875 --> 38:10.958
It'd take too much time to explain.

38:11.458 --> 38:13.916
The judge will try his best
to save the case.

38:14.458 --> 38:17.666
He's going to ask you questions
to get you to repeat your confession,

38:17.750 --> 38:19.958
which he could then use against you.

38:20.041 --> 38:21.250
All I'm asking is

38:22.708 --> 38:23.791
that you stay quiet.

38:28.125 --> 38:32.000
Hello, sir. Mr. Traoré.
I'm representing Mr. Millet.

38:32.666 --> 38:34.458
Sir, the floor is yours.

38:34.958 --> 38:36.583
Sir, I'll be brief.

38:37.500 --> 38:42.875
Police officers arrested Mr. Millet
at 10:58 a.m. on October 20th

38:42.958 --> 38:45.458
and placed him in custody
for violence with intent.

38:46.041 --> 38:47.625
While he was in custody,

38:47.708 --> 38:52.708
the detectives interrogated Mr. Millet
about a small amount of cannabis

38:52.791 --> 38:54.833
which they pretended he was carrying.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.791
"Pretended"?

38:56.875 --> 38:58.208
However,

38:58.291 --> 39:02.250
Mr. Millet wasn't placed
in custody for drug possession.

39:02.750 --> 39:06.416
He was there for violence with intent,
damage and breach of property.

39:06.500 --> 39:09.750
The prosecutor will be aware that,
according to French law,

39:09.833 --> 39:13.500
a person in custody
cannot be interrogated about an offense

39:13.583 --> 39:15.791
other than the one
they have been accused of.

39:15.875 --> 39:21.166
And that's not all. According to
Article 706-30-1 of the criminal code,

39:21.250 --> 39:25.333
when it comes to drug possession,
the weighing must be open.

39:25.416 --> 39:29.333
The person in custody must attend
the weighing of the products,

39:29.416 --> 39:31.083
which wasn't the case.

39:31.166 --> 39:34.500
For all these reasons, I'm asking for
the cancellation of the proceedings.

39:40.916 --> 39:41.791
Very well.

39:42.833 --> 39:43.916
Sir.

39:46.208 --> 39:50.208
We have Mr. Millet's confession
in which he admitted

39:50.291 --> 39:53.416
to punching Mrs. Marty in the face
several times.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.500
He can't deny it, as her jaw was broken

39:57.000 --> 40:00.958
because, and let me quote him,

40:01.500 --> 40:03.583
"The bitch didn't want to open the door."

40:03.666 --> 40:06.916
That's all. I'll let you appreciate
his artful wording.

40:08.333 --> 40:10.625
Are these your words, Mr. Millet?

40:13.625 --> 40:15.125
Mr. Millet, please?

40:18.791 --> 40:19.750
I'll remain silent.

40:19.833 --> 40:20.666
What?

40:21.208 --> 40:24.208
Speak louder, Mr. Millet.
We can't hear you.

40:28.875 --> 40:30.000
I'll remain silent.

40:46.125 --> 40:48.083
A bit like him, I'm full of hate

40:49.416 --> 40:51.625
I come from the bottom, like Martin Eden

40:52.625 --> 40:53.708
A bit like him, I--

40:55.166 --> 40:56.375
The Frenchman is back.

40:56.458 --> 40:59.541
No. Don't tell me you walked through
the projects like that, please.

40:59.625 --> 41:02.208
With a big blue, white, and red flag.

41:02.291 --> 41:03.791
Okay, I was joking, man.

41:03.875 --> 41:05.041
Fuck you.

41:07.250 --> 41:08.750
The lawyer is so rude.

41:11.333 --> 41:14.041
Mama, you're looking at Mr. Traoré,
attorney-at-law.

41:14.583 --> 41:16.500
You're handsome, my son.

41:16.583 --> 41:19.666
Thank you. I pleaded in court
for the first time today.

41:19.750 --> 41:21.083
I got the client released.

41:21.166 --> 41:23.625
Wow. Tell me about it, my son.

41:25.666 --> 41:26.875
Come on, tell us.

41:28.416 --> 41:32.500
A man accused of breaking his wife's jaw
was taken for immediate arraignment,

41:32.583 --> 41:33.583
and I managed to…

41:35.291 --> 41:36.208
What, Ma?

41:36.291 --> 41:37.875
They need an attorney too.

41:37.958 --> 41:39.333
But does it have to be you?

42:20.541 --> 42:21.416
So?

42:24.208 --> 42:25.625
Forget about insulation.

42:26.875 --> 42:27.875
Open a restaurant.

42:29.416 --> 42:31.416
You'll have learned that in the slammer.

42:35.208 --> 42:36.708
There's something I don't get.

42:37.458 --> 42:38.583
Who took Sahli out?

42:38.666 --> 42:40.541
It can't be Abdou. He was his friend.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.041
These things happen.

42:43.791 --> 42:45.375
It wouldn't be the first time.

42:54.416 --> 42:56.750
Do you know the story
about the frog and the scorpion?

42:59.333 --> 43:02.208
A scorpion goes to a frog and asks,

43:03.833 --> 43:06.375
"Can you carry me on your back
across the river?"

43:07.125 --> 43:09.791
The frog looks at the scorpion and says,

43:10.666 --> 43:12.916
"No. You're going to sting me."

43:14.416 --> 43:16.041
The scorpion looks at the frog

43:17.083 --> 43:20.541
and says, "But if I sting you,
we're both going to drown."

43:21.250 --> 43:22.333
"I can't swim."

43:23.083 --> 43:24.875
The frog thinks about it

43:25.583 --> 43:27.166
and eventually agrees.

43:28.375 --> 43:29.791
They start crossing the river.

43:30.541 --> 43:32.000
In the middle of the river,

43:32.500 --> 43:34.166
the scorpion stings the frog.

43:34.958 --> 43:36.000
The scorpion says,

43:38.375 --> 43:39.333
"I'm sorry."

43:40.291 --> 43:41.583
"I couldn't help it."

43:42.458 --> 43:43.500
"It's my nature."

43:45.708 --> 43:47.041
And they both drown.

44:02.333 --> 44:03.291
Did you know it?

44:11.375 --> 44:12.250
Yeah.

44:13.958 --> 44:15.958
I like hearing you tell stories.

45:00.375 --> 45:01.875
Yeah! Hey, Noumouké!

45:05.041 --> 45:06.541
Catch that son of a bitch!

45:11.250 --> 45:12.458
Stop running!

45:13.708 --> 45:15.666
-You're dead!
-I'm going to fuck you up!

45:15.750 --> 45:16.625
Stop!

45:16.708 --> 45:18.041
Come here, you bitch!

45:25.708 --> 45:27.625
We're going to kill that guy. Get him!

45:34.916 --> 45:37.125
-Look!
-He's there!

45:37.208 --> 45:38.541
Go fuck your mothers!

45:43.083 --> 45:44.041
Fuck him up!

45:55.458 --> 45:56.541
Where's that bastard?

45:58.083 --> 46:01.625
-Come on, go around. We'll catch him.
-Over there.

46:12.458 --> 46:14.125
-Don't do anything stupid.
-No.

46:21.708 --> 46:22.916
What are you doing here?

46:23.458 --> 46:26.000
Get lost. Stop sucking your teeth.

46:26.666 --> 46:28.333
I said not to give them anything.

46:28.416 --> 46:29.791
I know, Farid. I won't.

46:58.916 --> 47:01.625
Three, two, one.

47:02.125 --> 47:03.125
Look at that.

47:05.333 --> 47:06.250
It's wonderful.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.250
You know what they say?

47:09.083 --> 47:10.041
No.

47:10.125 --> 47:12.250
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

47:13.083 --> 47:14.500
You're such a smooth talker.

47:16.625 --> 47:17.541
Have you ever gone up?

47:18.041 --> 47:19.625
No, but I'd really like to.

47:20.166 --> 47:21.000
Yeah?

47:25.125 --> 47:25.958
And you?

47:27.583 --> 47:28.458
Not yet.

47:42.541 --> 47:44.666
We can't keep seeing each other like this.

47:45.375 --> 47:46.250
"Like this"?

47:46.750 --> 47:48.541
Like this, without purpose.

47:49.083 --> 47:52.791
I need to know where we're headed.
I can't play. I don't have the time.

47:52.875 --> 47:54.333
You think I'm playing?

47:54.416 --> 47:56.583
No, I didn't say that.

47:57.208 --> 47:59.708
But I'm warning you.

48:00.791 --> 48:02.875
And nothing is going to happen.

48:03.666 --> 48:04.583
Meaning?

48:05.250 --> 48:07.333
Nothing is going to happen physically.

48:08.375 --> 48:09.458
I'm saving myself.

48:11.791 --> 48:12.625
Fine with me.

48:15.583 --> 48:16.458
And so?

48:17.750 --> 48:20.375
-What do you mean, "And so?"
-What do you want?

48:34.583 --> 48:36.000
-Hello?
-Hello?

48:36.083 --> 48:37.500
-Yeah.
-Noumouké?

48:37.583 --> 48:40.208
-Noumouké?
-I'm joking. It's Noumouké's voice mail.

48:40.291 --> 48:41.458
It's his voice mail.

48:54.208 --> 48:56.250
Go ahead. You can pick up. I don't mind.

48:56.333 --> 48:57.458
No, it's my mother.

48:58.541 --> 49:00.583
I'll take you home.
Then I'll call her back.

49:04.958 --> 49:06.291
Here's a story.

49:08.541 --> 49:10.500
A friend of mine was at a restaurant,

49:10.583 --> 49:14.041
and her mother wouldn't stop calling,
you know?

49:14.791 --> 49:16.125
Instead of picking up,

49:16.666 --> 49:19.333
she sent her a message,
saying, "I'll call you later."

49:20.583 --> 49:21.833
But later never came.

49:24.625 --> 49:26.458
That story traumatized me.

49:26.541 --> 49:29.166
Now, when my mother calls me,
I pick up right away.

49:34.000 --> 49:35.083
Yeah, Mom, it's me.

49:35.166 --> 49:38.666
Demba. Help me find Noumouké.
Noumouké didn't come home.

49:38.750 --> 49:41.250
Find him for me. I don't know where he is.

50:14.708 --> 50:15.625
Hey!

50:19.666 --> 50:21.958
-I'm going to fuck you up!
-Shut up!

50:58.375 --> 50:59.250
Let go of me!

51:14.458 --> 51:15.291
Gun!

51:18.708 --> 51:19.708
Come on, get up!

51:19.791 --> 51:21.625
Sofia! Come on, let's go!

52:02.500 --> 52:03.583
Lamine, come here.

52:04.583 --> 52:05.750
I said, come here.

52:09.541 --> 52:11.666
-Where is Noumouké?
-I don't know.

52:11.750 --> 52:13.750
-Don't play with me, Lamine.
-I'm not.

52:13.833 --> 52:15.958
-Where is Noumouké?
-I don't know.

52:16.041 --> 52:18.166
-Did he get arrested?
-No, he didn't.

52:18.791 --> 52:19.875
Who fired the gun?

52:20.458 --> 52:21.958
No one fired the gun.

52:22.041 --> 52:23.666
"No one fired the gun"?

52:23.750 --> 52:26.458
It was Sofia, but she fired into the air.

52:26.541 --> 52:29.166
-Then we all ran away.
-Where did she get the piece?

52:30.916 --> 52:32.000
Where did she get it?

52:32.500 --> 52:33.708
At Farid's trap house.

52:35.083 --> 52:36.750
They're waiting to get paid.

52:36.833 --> 52:37.750
Yeah, but…

52:40.875 --> 52:41.708
Hey.

52:44.166 --> 52:45.750
You give weapons to my brother?

52:46.291 --> 52:47.291
I didn't.

52:47.375 --> 52:49.958
-To his friends. It's the same thing.
-I didn't, Demba.

52:50.041 --> 52:52.250
Then they did. Aren't you the boss?

52:53.958 --> 52:56.875
-Are you for real?
-What do you mean, "Am I for real"?

52:58.208 --> 53:01.500
-You do this in front of everybody?
-What are you going to do?

53:02.708 --> 53:03.958
Don't lie to yourself.

53:04.041 --> 53:05.666
You're here because I left.

53:12.416 --> 53:13.708
Get that son of a bitch!

53:14.416 --> 53:15.875
Get him! Bring him back to me!

53:18.291 --> 53:19.875
Bruh, are you okay?

53:20.375 --> 53:21.750
I'm going to end him.

53:24.958 --> 53:26.625
Pick your side, and fast.

53:28.666 --> 53:30.166
He's going to go back to prison.

53:30.250 --> 53:31.583
Stop scaring her.

53:32.166 --> 53:33.083
Nobody died.

53:36.666 --> 53:41.166
Noumouké needs to leave
the gangs and weapons behind.

53:42.041 --> 53:43.500
You need to talk to him.

53:46.583 --> 53:49.916
Mom, when I was his age,
there already was trouble with Aviateurs.

53:51.208 --> 53:52.708
I was involved in it too.

53:53.250 --> 53:54.208
Exactly.

53:54.708 --> 53:56.666
That's why he's going to listen to you.

53:59.000 --> 54:00.000
Will you?

54:01.333 --> 54:02.333
Yeah.

54:04.125 --> 54:04.958
Okay.

54:08.666 --> 54:10.041
Don't worry. He'll be back.

54:15.458 --> 54:17.208
-Bye.
-Bye.

54:27.708 --> 54:29.500
-It's Lamine.
-What is he saying?

54:30.000 --> 54:31.916
Demba got him. He's looking for you.

54:32.000 --> 54:33.833
Fuck, he's going to kill me.

54:34.458 --> 54:35.833
I can't go home tonight.

54:36.875 --> 54:38.083
You're staying here?

54:39.000 --> 54:41.458
My brother leaves for work at 8:00 a.m.
My mom at 9:00 a.m.

54:41.541 --> 54:42.916
I'll wait for them to go.

54:45.250 --> 54:47.625
I need to go home,
or my mother will destroy me.

54:49.250 --> 54:50.541
Stay with me for a bit?

55:03.750 --> 55:05.875
I would've liked
to have brothers and sisters.

55:06.708 --> 55:07.916
Am I not your brother?

55:13.291 --> 55:14.791
Do you miss your father?

55:14.875 --> 55:16.000
Yeah, I miss him.

55:17.750 --> 55:18.666
And you?

55:20.291 --> 55:22.208
I can't miss him. I don't know him.

55:23.291 --> 55:26.541
When he heard my mother was pregnant,
he left. He didn't want me.

55:28.291 --> 55:30.416
One day, we can try and look for him.

55:31.000 --> 55:33.541
He doesn't want me.
I'm not going to run after him.

55:37.208 --> 55:39.916
Dad isn't here anymore
Nobody knows how much pain I am in

55:40.000 --> 55:42.750
I feel like I am in a starless night

55:44.083 --> 55:45.291
Are these your lyrics?

55:45.875 --> 55:46.708
Yeah.

55:48.291 --> 55:49.250
Go on, sing it.

55:57.625 --> 56:00.000
Dad isn't here anymore
Nobody knows much pain I'm in

56:00.083 --> 56:02.708
I feel like I am in a starless night

56:02.791 --> 56:05.250
It's all blurry
I don't know where to go

56:06.000 --> 56:07.458
I just feel like running away

56:07.541 --> 56:10.125
Mom doesn't smile anymore
Home feels empty

56:10.625 --> 56:12.166
No sun on the horizon

56:12.250 --> 56:14.791
And some voids can never be filled

56:15.583 --> 56:18.583
We can tell ourselves it will pass
But Dad isn't here anymore

56:19.458 --> 56:21.000
My Dad isn't here anymore

56:21.916 --> 56:23.625
Nobody knows how much pain I am in

56:24.375 --> 56:25.916
Nobody knows how much pain I am in

56:26.000 --> 56:27.916
Since Dad is gone

56:28.750 --> 56:30.333
Even summer feels cold

56:48.708 --> 56:52.041
ALARM
06:45

57:07.916 --> 57:09.083
What are you doing, Ma?

57:11.250 --> 57:13.041
I'm looking out for the police

57:13.541 --> 57:16.083
so that I can open the door
before they break it.

57:17.500 --> 57:19.166
They aren't going to come.

57:20.833 --> 57:21.666
Come.

57:22.291 --> 57:23.250
Come rest.

57:23.333 --> 57:25.583
I'm tired, Noumouké.

57:47.208 --> 57:48.500
Police!

57:48.583 --> 57:50.958
-What's going on?
-Don't move! Show your hands!

57:54.333 --> 57:56.041
-Your hands!
-Yes! What's going on?

57:56.125 --> 57:57.708
Come here. On your knees!

57:58.375 --> 57:59.333
What's going on?

58:05.583 --> 58:06.416
Sofia!

58:08.333 --> 58:09.875
Sofia, what have you done?

58:11.000 --> 58:12.333
What's happening?

58:15.291 --> 58:16.416
You look beautiful.

58:21.333 --> 58:22.333
I'm heading out.

58:23.583 --> 58:24.833
When are you leaving?

58:25.833 --> 58:29.166
I won't go to work until Noumouké is back.

58:29.250 --> 58:32.000
It's going to be fine, okay?
He's going to come home.

58:32.625 --> 58:33.458
I love you.

58:33.958 --> 58:35.416
I love you too.

58:50.958 --> 58:52.583
Madam, put your phone away.

58:53.333 --> 58:56.333
-This isn't a show.
-Sofia!

58:57.125 --> 58:59.250
Where are you taking her? Sofia.

58:59.333 --> 59:01.208
-Where are you taking her?
-Let go of me!

59:01.291 --> 59:04.375
You hear what I'm saying?
Put the phone away. Stop filming.

59:04.458 --> 59:06.416
-What did she do?
-Let go of me!

59:08.041 --> 59:09.125
Mom!

59:09.791 --> 59:11.541
Come on, move along.

59:12.416 --> 59:13.583
Mom!

59:13.666 --> 59:14.958
Help!

59:20.291 --> 59:22.041
What did he do? Did he hit you?

01:00:10.666 --> 01:00:11.791
…not far away

01:00:12.333 --> 01:00:14.166
No time for tomorrow

01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:16.541
And if we were far away from here

01:00:17.083 --> 01:00:18.958
But near Panama

01:00:20.291 --> 01:00:21.708
Far away

01:00:21.791 --> 01:00:23.708
No time for tomorrow

01:00:23.791 --> 01:00:26.541
And if we were far away from here

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:28.125
Oh baby

01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:33.000
We promised each other to never let go
That we would--

01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:36.500
Ma?

01:00:39.833 --> 01:00:40.708
Ma?

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:44.666
Ma?

01:01:36.833 --> 01:01:41.125
Only God can create
something that doesn't exist.

01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:44.750
Human beings are not able to create.

01:01:44.833 --> 01:01:49.083
For if human beings could create,
then the blind man would make himself see.

01:01:50.125 --> 01:01:52.375
The deaf man would make himself hear.

01:01:53.166 --> 01:01:56.333
The quadriplegic
would make himself mobile.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.750
Not only that,

01:01:58.833 --> 01:02:02.750
but most human beings
would give themselves

01:02:02.833 --> 01:02:04.458
and their loved ones eternal life.

01:02:05.166 --> 01:02:07.541
So, my brother, love whoever you want.

01:02:08.125 --> 01:02:10.958
Create attachments to whomever you want.
You'll be separated from them.

01:02:11.041 --> 01:02:11.875
Salam.

01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:17.375
Death is like a doorway
that each of us will cross.

01:02:17.458 --> 01:02:18.375
My condolences.

01:02:18.458 --> 01:02:19.916
Death is a journey.

01:02:20.833 --> 01:02:24.541
What does anyone with the gift of reason
do before a journey?

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:15.125
How are you feeling?

01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:20.666
I used to think I was alone.
Now I truly know what it is.

01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:23.541
Listen…

01:03:25.541 --> 01:03:27.791
I have a few things to do once I'm back.

01:03:29.958 --> 01:03:30.833
After that,

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:33.375
I'd like to meet your son.

01:03:35.458 --> 01:03:37.666
And I'd like us to do things by the book.

01:03:39.416 --> 01:03:43.916
You know, Demba, there are two states
in which one shouldn't make big decisions.

01:03:44.416 --> 01:03:47.333
When you're really happy
and when you're really sad.

01:03:48.541 --> 01:03:49.791
I know what I'm saying.

01:03:53.041 --> 01:03:53.916
You're going?

01:03:54.958 --> 01:03:55.958
Yeah, I'm going.

01:03:57.875 --> 01:03:59.791
-Let's talk later?
-Okay.

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:06.166
Have you heard from Mercier?

01:04:07.166 --> 01:04:08.875
Don't you want to talk about this later?

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.541
What's going on?

01:04:13.208 --> 01:04:16.916
Listen, he's backing out.
He's going with another team.

01:04:18.208 --> 01:04:20.000
Don't look at me like that.

01:04:20.083 --> 01:04:20.958
He's backing out?

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.125
We signed a contract.

01:04:23.208 --> 01:04:25.416
Did you have a lawyer read that contract?

01:04:28.083 --> 01:04:29.625
I invested time and money.

01:04:30.541 --> 01:04:32.125
-I know.
-A lot of money.

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:39.916
How much did they give him?

01:04:41.708 --> 01:04:42.916
-Who?
-The other team.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.500
How much to get rid of us?

01:04:44.583 --> 01:04:45.708
Well, I don't know.

01:04:46.625 --> 01:04:47.625
How much does he want?

01:04:50.666 --> 01:04:53.375
He'll go with us
if we give him 150,000 in cash.

01:04:57.083 --> 01:04:58.458
What was your response?

01:04:58.541 --> 01:05:00.041
I didn't close the door to it.

01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:04.791
With all the dough you're going to make,
what's 150,000?

01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:17.458
My condolences, Demba.

01:05:21.125 --> 01:05:21.958
Hey, Franck.

01:05:24.375 --> 01:05:27.708
What made him think that you have
150,000 euros lying around like that?

01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:31.375
I don't know.

01:05:34.666 --> 01:05:35.625
You don't know?

01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:40.208
Come see me at the office when I get back.

01:05:41.458 --> 01:05:43.166
Until then, you tell him yes.

01:05:44.833 --> 01:05:45.666
Got it.

01:05:47.958 --> 01:05:49.458
Take care of yourself, Franck.

01:05:50.416 --> 01:05:52.625
Yeah, for sure. You too.

01:07:45.541 --> 01:07:46.500
Noumouké.

01:07:51.833 --> 01:07:54.666
He says you look like
your cousin, Ousmaan.

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:56.500
Ousmaan.

01:08:12.208 --> 01:08:14.541
You can't deny you are a Traoré.

01:08:22.375 --> 01:08:24.750
When family is corrupted and divided,

01:08:24.833 --> 01:08:27.250
then the whole of society is unwell.

01:08:59.041 --> 01:09:01.166
Come on, Noumouké. Get up.

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:02.333
I'm coming.

01:09:02.416 --> 01:09:03.625
I've come twice already.

01:09:07.416 --> 01:09:11.041
Demba, I haven't showered. I'm sweaty.

01:09:12.708 --> 01:09:14.125
Take that. Get changed.

01:09:20.958 --> 01:09:22.500
What time is it?

01:09:23.916 --> 01:09:25.583
-You've slept enough.
-I'm tired.

01:09:40.166 --> 01:09:41.208
Where's that well?

01:09:41.708 --> 01:09:43.208
Thirty minutes on foot.

01:09:43.291 --> 01:09:44.541
Thirty minutes?

01:09:44.625 --> 01:09:46.375
Thirty minutes? More like an hour.

01:09:46.875 --> 01:09:48.083
How do you know?

01:09:49.083 --> 01:09:50.458
You ask too many questions.

01:09:54.666 --> 01:09:57.875
He acted out so much
that your mom sent him here.

01:10:00.083 --> 01:10:01.583
Aren't you coming?

01:10:01.666 --> 01:10:03.208
No, I'll leave this to you.

01:10:39.291 --> 01:10:40.125
It's deep, huh?

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:47.041
Okay.

01:10:48.791 --> 01:10:49.625
Release it.

01:11:25.208 --> 01:11:26.625
-Hi, Ousmaan.
-Noumouké.

01:11:27.875 --> 01:11:28.750
Hello.

01:11:35.666 --> 01:11:37.666
Hens sit on their eggs…

01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.916
It's the village school.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.541
Your mother financed
most of it with her charity.

01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:46.625
She didn't have the time to finish it.

01:11:51.750 --> 01:11:52.583
Hello.

01:11:54.083 --> 01:11:55.791
-Hello, Mr. Fodié.
-How are you?

01:11:55.875 --> 01:11:58.500
These are the children
of my sister-in-law, Khadijah.

01:11:59.458 --> 01:12:00.458
My condolences.

01:12:03.625 --> 01:12:05.541
How do you manage during rainy season?

01:12:07.458 --> 01:12:08.666
It gets complicated.

01:12:11.791 --> 01:12:13.333
We have to finish it.

01:12:13.416 --> 01:12:14.458
It's a lot of work.

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:17.708
-Fodié.
-Yes?

01:12:17.791 --> 01:12:20.083
Do you think you can find
the materials and workers?

01:12:20.166 --> 01:12:21.541
With money, sure.

01:12:21.625 --> 01:12:23.375
-Don't worry about money.
-Okay.

01:12:35.125 --> 01:12:37.041
Please share your network with me, Demba.

01:12:38.541 --> 01:12:40.041
Put your phone away.

01:12:40.125 --> 01:12:41.541
Seriously, I really need it.

01:13:05.875 --> 01:13:09.083
He says that he doesn't need his phone,
but he wants it.

01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:14.208
You live better here than we do.

01:13:26.958 --> 01:13:29.000
He says that you're idealizing Africa.

01:13:29.083 --> 01:13:33.791
It's been a long time since our societies
became consumer societies too.

01:13:38.708 --> 01:13:40.750
Why does he never speak in French?

01:13:42.083 --> 01:13:45.250
I speak French better than you.

01:13:55.833 --> 01:13:56.666
Hey, come!

01:14:09.958 --> 01:14:11.208
Bags go over there.

01:14:33.666 --> 01:14:34.500
Yes, Auntie.

01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:36.375
-Driss?
-Yeah?

01:14:36.458 --> 01:14:37.416
Let's put it up.

01:14:38.416 --> 01:14:40.333
-Watch your fingers, guys.
-Yeah.

01:14:40.833 --> 01:14:42.250
Thanks. Okay. We got it.

01:14:43.625 --> 01:14:46.125
-Is that okay?
-You got it?

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:51.833
Okay.

01:15:06.875 --> 01:15:08.541
Come on, Demba. Yeah.

01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:12.416
Yeah!

01:15:25.291 --> 01:15:27.250
-Okay?
-Thank you very much.

01:15:30.541 --> 01:15:32.125
Time for a break, guys. Let's eat?

01:15:33.041 --> 01:15:34.333
I'll finish up and join you.

01:15:39.875 --> 01:15:40.875
You forgot this bit.

01:15:42.750 --> 01:15:44.000
These big pants of yours.

01:15:54.166 --> 01:15:55.333
Looks good, doesn't it?

01:15:58.916 --> 01:16:00.291
I'm going back to France.

01:16:02.708 --> 01:16:05.041
I'm going to stay with the kid
a few more days.

01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.625
I need to get inside his head.

01:16:12.125 --> 01:16:13.041
Are you ready?

01:16:17.333 --> 01:16:18.916
I'm warning you, we can't back out.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:54.250
MINISTRY OF CULTURE
HOUSE OF SLAVES

01:16:59.041 --> 01:16:59.875
Hello.

01:17:07.208 --> 01:17:11.416
Officially, 12 million slaves
were deported to the Americas.

01:17:13.416 --> 01:17:17.250
And some of them were detained
in places similar to this.

01:17:17.875 --> 01:17:19.666
It served as a waiting room.

01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:22.583
Just like when you get to the hospital,
there's a waiting room.

01:17:22.666 --> 01:17:26.375
Small rowboats took them
from here to the big ships,

01:17:26.458 --> 01:17:28.208
which in turn went to America.

01:17:28.291 --> 01:17:31.250
So, after the door, there was a bridge.

01:17:31.333 --> 01:17:34.083
We call it the door of no return

01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:37.250
because whoever crossed it
never came back.

01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:33.833
KHADIJAH TRAORÉ SCHOOL

01:18:38.666 --> 01:18:41.125
LEARN, UNDERSTAND
UNDERTAKE, SERVE

01:18:45.416 --> 01:18:47.083
Do you know what Mom asked of me?

01:18:47.875 --> 01:18:48.791
What?

01:18:49.583 --> 01:18:51.458
For me to tell you to stop your nonsense.

01:18:51.541 --> 01:18:53.958
-What nonsense?
-Your shitty projects nonsense.

01:18:54.875 --> 01:18:57.041
You were doing the same thing at my age.

01:18:57.125 --> 01:18:58.500
I told her you'd say that.

01:18:59.833 --> 01:19:01.166
Want to hear something?

01:19:02.666 --> 01:19:03.666
With violence,

01:19:04.750 --> 01:19:06.708
you decide when to start using it,

01:19:07.458 --> 01:19:09.250
but you don't choose when it ends.

01:19:16.083 --> 01:19:18.125
Sometimes I feel like
Noumouké is upset with me.

01:19:21.416 --> 01:19:24.500
I could have told the cops
that he wasn't involved.

01:19:25.208 --> 01:19:26.166
But I didn't.

01:19:27.375 --> 01:19:29.083
He'd do it again if he had to.

01:19:34.166 --> 01:19:35.666
What are you going to do?

01:19:41.666 --> 01:19:43.250
I've never told anyone,

01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:47.166
but I think
I've been having panic attacks.

01:19:47.250 --> 01:19:48.083
Yeah?

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:51.791
Have you seen anyone?

01:19:52.458 --> 01:19:53.333
Seen who?

01:19:54.291 --> 01:19:55.166
A therapist.

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:59.291
Me? See a therapist? Have you ever seen
a Black man go to a therapist?

01:20:00.291 --> 01:20:02.583
You're such a caricature of yourself.

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:05.750
It can help to talk sometimes.

01:20:33.916 --> 01:20:35.000
Give me five.

01:21:42.333 --> 01:21:43.375
What are you doing?

01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000
What is he doing?

01:21:47.166 --> 01:21:49.166
-Come on. Stop.
-Don't make me run.

01:21:51.125 --> 01:21:52.000
-Don't hurt me!
-Quiet!

01:21:52.083 --> 01:21:54.250
You'll have your construction sites.

01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:58.500
Come here! I said, come here!

01:21:58.583 --> 01:22:00.625
So, you want to play with me? Come here!

01:22:11.666 --> 01:22:13.500
Run, Forrest, run!

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.083
Abdou!

01:22:28.833 --> 01:22:29.666
Stop!

01:22:33.458 --> 01:22:34.291
Stop!

01:22:48.875 --> 01:22:51.125
No! Demba, stop.

01:22:51.208 --> 01:22:52.833
Calm down. It was Abdel.

01:22:53.625 --> 01:22:55.458
Abdel and Sahli. I wasn't there.

01:23:12.208 --> 01:23:13.250
What are you proud of?

01:23:13.333 --> 01:23:14.583
You're proud of this?

01:23:16.583 --> 01:23:17.916
You're fighting for that?

01:23:19.791 --> 01:23:21.791
These buildings we grew up in.

01:23:22.375 --> 01:23:24.916
In poverty. No elevators. Roaches.

01:23:26.291 --> 01:23:28.125
That's what you're ready to die for?

01:23:28.708 --> 01:23:32.166
All day long, all you say is,
"No one likes us in this country."

01:23:32.250 --> 01:23:33.375
"No one respects us."

01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:36.125
"Fuck the state. There's no work."

01:23:36.625 --> 01:23:37.916
"Fuck the police."

01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.875
So? Of course, fuck the police.

01:23:39.958 --> 01:23:41.416
You've got something to say?

01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:42.583
Your eye injury,

01:23:43.166 --> 01:23:45.833
was it the cops' fault
or because of your stupid raid?

01:23:47.958 --> 01:23:52.625
How can you expect anyone to respect us?
We don't even respect one another.

01:23:53.208 --> 01:23:54.833
Why would anyone like us?

01:23:55.416 --> 01:23:56.708
We hate one another.

01:23:57.791 --> 01:24:00.666
And you're always like,
"I love my mother."

01:24:00.750 --> 01:24:02.708
"I'll make her a millionaire."

01:24:02.791 --> 01:24:04.791
You know what you're going to get her?

01:24:04.875 --> 01:24:07.375
Your moms are here. Ask them.

01:24:09.833 --> 01:24:10.708
A casket.

01:24:11.791 --> 01:24:13.333
Because of your issues.

01:24:13.833 --> 01:24:15.916
First leg. Second leg.

01:24:16.583 --> 01:24:18.166
It's like the Champions League.

01:24:18.916 --> 01:24:22.750
And for the one lying on the ground,
it's game over.

01:24:22.833 --> 01:24:25.583
-They come here and bust our balls.
-Shut up!

01:24:28.458 --> 01:24:32.000
Noumouké, Anis. Shake hands.

01:24:33.916 --> 01:24:34.916
Shake hands.

01:24:47.375 --> 01:24:51.583
We can clearly see the police officer
grab the phone and throw it on the ground.

01:24:51.666 --> 01:24:54.875
What he didn't know was
that another witness was filming.

01:24:55.875 --> 01:25:00.333
I can imagine that you decided
to file a complaint against the officers?

01:25:00.416 --> 01:25:05.541
I tried to file a complaint the day after.
I had to visit two police stations.

01:25:05.625 --> 01:25:09.791
It's common for police officers to refuse
a complaint in this type of case.

01:25:09.875 --> 01:25:12.166
Police tend to protect their own.

01:25:12.250 --> 01:25:15.916
You have a very simplistic vision
of the police corps.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:18.750
I don't wake up wanting
to beat up Black people and Arabs.

01:25:18.833 --> 01:25:19.833
Why is he talking?

01:25:19.916 --> 01:25:22.458
That may be the case for you.
I don't mean to essentialize.

01:25:22.958 --> 01:25:25.416
During the yellow jacket protests,

01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:29.541
we saw that the violence experienced
by the communities in the projects

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:33.125
could also be used
against poor, white communities.

01:25:33.208 --> 01:25:36.250
We aren't talking about
yellow jackets in a protest right now.

01:25:36.333 --> 01:25:39.416
This is the mother of an offender
resisting her daughter's arrest.

01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:41.708
Her daughter is incarcerated.

01:25:42.708 --> 01:25:45.250
Once again, that is not the issue at hand.

01:25:45.333 --> 01:25:47.500
We're not discussing her daughter's trial.

01:25:48.291 --> 01:25:52.166
We're questioning the methods
employed by police officers

01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:53.500
that hit a woman,

01:25:54.125 --> 01:25:55.166
a mother,

01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:59.208
sprayed her with tear gas,
and left her on the ground in pain.

01:25:59.291 --> 01:26:00.791
The issue is the violence.

01:26:00.875 --> 01:26:02.875
I have met with these mothers in tears

01:26:02.958 --> 01:26:05.208
who had just lost a child.

01:26:05.291 --> 01:26:06.625
Let me tell you one thing.

01:26:06.708 --> 01:26:11.083
These mothers aren't worried
about so-called police brutality.

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:13.125
It's easy to denounce

01:26:13.208 --> 01:26:15.875
supposed police brutality.

01:26:16.541 --> 01:26:19.500
When it comes to denouncing
the violence used by these offenders,

01:26:19.583 --> 01:26:22.583
whose victims are primarily
from communities in the projects,

01:26:22.666 --> 01:26:23.666
no one says a thing.

01:26:34.416 --> 01:26:35.250
See you later.

01:26:40.083 --> 01:26:41.000
He's coming out.

01:26:47.875 --> 01:26:49.583
-Have a good day.
-Have a good day.

01:28:15.166 --> 01:28:16.708
Your book pissed me off, miss.

01:28:16.791 --> 01:28:17.625
Is that all?

01:28:17.708 --> 01:28:21.041
This guy works hard to become
someone else, and he ends up alone.

01:28:21.125 --> 01:28:24.791
With a bit of willpower and work,
we can become whatever we want.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.041
Not always, miss.

01:28:27.125 --> 01:28:29.291
In life, some things are beyond us.

01:28:30.250 --> 01:28:32.333
But we can control some things.

01:28:32.916 --> 01:28:34.750
And maybe what the author is saying is

01:28:34.833 --> 01:28:37.666
that it's not for other people
that you should try your best.

01:28:40.916 --> 01:28:41.916
Can I read it?

01:28:49.250 --> 01:28:50.833
Officers are subject to quotas.

01:28:50.916 --> 01:28:52.625
Management puts pressure on them.

01:28:52.708 --> 01:28:55.250
And, of course,
they're expected to hit their targets.

01:28:55.333 --> 01:28:57.083
So what you are saying is

01:28:57.166 --> 01:28:59.583
that violence committed by the police

01:28:59.666 --> 01:29:02.791
against a targeted group
within the population

01:29:02.875 --> 01:29:05.166
is a consequence of a quota system

01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:08.291
by the Ministry of the Interior
and, therefore, the state.

01:29:08.875 --> 01:29:10.750
You've answered our question.

01:29:10.833 --> 01:29:13.875
Not only is the state not doing a thing
to prevent police brutality,

01:29:13.958 --> 01:29:15.833
but it's actually encouraging it.

01:29:15.916 --> 01:29:18.791
Okay, this woman is in good health.

01:29:18.875 --> 01:29:19.958
She's alive.

01:29:21.416 --> 01:29:24.833
This isn't the George Floyd case
in the United States.

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.875
Clearly, she didn't end up
like Amine Bentounsi,

01:29:28.541 --> 01:29:29.791
who was shot in the back.

01:29:31.416 --> 01:29:33.750
Or suffocated, like Amadou Koumé.

01:29:35.250 --> 01:29:38.166
In France, we have our own George Floyds.
It's nothing new.

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:43.000
I'm always amazed by the way some people

01:29:43.083 --> 01:29:46.541
are upset by police brutality
on the other side of the Atlantic

01:29:47.125 --> 01:29:51.250
while they remain blind, deaf, and mute
about the same brutality in France.

01:29:52.166 --> 01:29:56.750
We both know that if a neighbor
hadn't filmed what happened,

01:29:56.833 --> 01:30:00.416
Mrs. Fitoussi's words wouldn't have
held up against the police officers.

01:30:01.166 --> 01:30:03.791
She would've been portrayed
as a bad mother

01:30:03.875 --> 01:30:06.750
who couldn't even raise
her daughter right, isn't that so?

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.083
But let's try to see the big picture

01:30:16.916 --> 01:30:19.041
and not just debate back and forth.

01:30:19.708 --> 01:30:21.458
Slow down. They'll notice us.

01:30:30.416 --> 01:30:33.416
I'd say it's up to all of us
to make the world a better place.

01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:50.208
And we shouldn't minimize the impact
our actions can have on others.

01:30:58.916 --> 01:31:00.958
Get out of the car. Get out.

01:31:01.041 --> 01:31:03.000
A smile, a nice word,

01:31:05.083 --> 01:31:07.791
and kindness can change someone's day.

01:31:13.375 --> 01:31:15.500
A single day
can change the course of a life.

01:31:18.416 --> 01:31:21.791
That's why we must all challenge ourselves

01:31:23.416 --> 01:31:25.291
and stop repeating the same mistakes.

01:31:33.625 --> 01:31:35.708
Idrissa!

01:31:39.916 --> 01:31:42.375
Insanity is always doing the same thing

01:31:42.458 --> 01:31:44.458
and expecting different results.
