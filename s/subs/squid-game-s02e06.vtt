28:04.349 --> 28:07.477
[beeps]

28:08.520 --> 28:10.105
[beeps]

28:12.107 --> 28:13.400
[beeps]

28:17.445 --> 28:19.114
[masked manager] Player 388.

28:22.283 --> 28:24.411
Six more to win.

28:27.580 --> 28:28.706
[beeps]

28:31.000 --> 28:32.419
[masked manager] Player 380.

28:33.962 --> 28:35.171
[beeps]

28:36.464 --> 28:37.465
Five more.

28:45.140 --> 28:48.101
- [masked manager] Player 377.
- [Nam-gyu] That fucking bitch.

28:52.647 --> 28:53.982
[masked soldier] Number 011.

28:54.732 --> 28:59.404
If you'd done this sooner, you wouldn't
have gotten a scratch on your pretty face.

28:59.946 --> 29:01.572
Let's keep it this way.

29:01.573 --> 29:03.783
[masked soldier snickers]

29:08.830 --> 29:10.248
[door opening]

29:19.924 --> 29:21.384
[breathing heavily]

29:23.386 --> 29:24.928
[beeps]

29:24.929 --> 29:26.513
[masked manager] Player 230.

29:26.514 --> 29:28.600
[intense music]

29:32.061 --> 29:32.936
[beeps]

29:32.937 --> 29:33.980
Mwah!

29:36.357 --> 29:39.235
Circle! <i>Let's go!</i>

29:40.987 --> 29:47.785
[beeps]

29:51.372 --> 29:52.207
[beeps]

29:55.585 --> 29:58.337
[Dae-ho] It's four people now.
Four more, and we win.

29:58.338 --> 29:59.797
[masked manager] Player 149.

30:01.591 --> 30:05.594
If you pull the same crap again,
I'll hang myself right here.

30:05.595 --> 30:06.679
[Yong-sik] I got it.

30:12.602 --> 30:13.769
[beeps]

30:13.770 --> 30:15.438
[masked manager] Player 145.

30:20.985 --> 30:23.445
[in English] Min-su, just one more game.

30:23.446 --> 30:25.990
I already talked to him.

30:26.991 --> 30:29.577
We agreed to play one more game
and leave with one billion.

30:30.411 --> 30:31.538
[beeps]

30:32.080 --> 30:33.289
[masked manager] Player 125.

30:34.165 --> 30:36.918
Come on, Min-su. Come on.

30:42.757 --> 30:44.217
[intense music]

30:55.812 --> 30:56.937
[beeps]

30:56.938 --> 30:58.189
[Dae-ho and Jung-bae gasping]

30:58.940 --> 31:00.775
With three more people, we win.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.365
[masked manager] Player 124.

31:14.622 --> 31:15.540
[sighs]

31:18.376 --> 31:19.209
[beeps]

31:19.210 --> 31:20.586
[masked manager] Player 120.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.672
[ominous music]

31:31.055 --> 31:32.098
[beeps]

31:33.641 --> 31:35.684
Only two more now!

31:35.685 --> 31:37.102
[masked manager] Player 119.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.647
[Dae-ho] Two more.
We need two more people.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.246
[suspenseful music]

32:45.838 --> 32:47.464
I think it leads underground.

32:47.465 --> 32:48.549
Open it.

32:56.724 --> 32:58.309
- [explosion]
- [Woo-seok gasps]

32:59.811 --> 33:01.186
[beeps]

33:01.187 --> 33:03.021
[players cheer]

33:03.022 --> 33:04.898
[intense music]

33:04.899 --> 33:06.109
[masked manager] Player 015.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.830
[beeps]

33:20.707 --> 33:23.459
[Jung-bae] He switched to X!

33:24.043 --> 33:27.213
That's six! It's a tie now.
If we get one more person, we win.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.925
[Dae-ho] Are we really going home?

33:31.926 --> 33:33.052
[masked manager] Player 009.

33:42.270 --> 33:43.103
[beeps]

33:43.104 --> 33:44.856
[players cheer]

33:47.400 --> 33:49.861
It's all right. She voted O before anyway.

33:50.445 --> 33:51.571
[masked manager] Player 007.

33:59.787 --> 34:02.415
Your son will definitely vote X
this time, right?

34:02.999 --> 34:07.753
Don't worry. My Yong-sik
will definitely press X this time.

34:07.754 --> 34:09.088
[beeps]

34:10.089 --> 34:12.340
[Dae-ho] He switched sides! That's it!

34:12.341 --> 34:13.760
Yes!

34:15.595 --> 34:17.179
Let's go home!

34:17.180 --> 34:19.098
- Yes! Let's go home!
- [Dae-ho] Yes!

34:20.224 --> 34:22.852
- [masked manager] Player 006.
- [Dae-ho] He was the seventh one.

34:28.191 --> 34:31.235
We did it. They're both on our side.
We're going to win!

34:34.489 --> 34:36.491
[dark music]

34:41.704 --> 34:42.747
Gi-hun.

34:43.539 --> 34:44.415
Yeah?

34:45.208 --> 34:46.501
About Young-il...

34:49.170 --> 34:50.046
What about him?

34:50.588 --> 34:54.466
Well, when I was
in the room with him earlier...

34:54.467 --> 34:56.552
- [beeps]
- [players cheer]

35:12.360 --> 35:13.819
[woman 1] Good job.

35:13.820 --> 35:16.447
- [man] Well done! That's great!
- [woman 2] Yes!

35:18.658 --> 35:20.993
[masked manager] Lastly, Player 001.

35:21.619 --> 35:22.912
Please cast your vote.

35:24.914 --> 35:26.916
[intriguing music]

35:30.002 --> 35:31.170
[Dae-ho] Brother Young-il.

35:32.046 --> 35:32.880
Let's go!

35:33.756 --> 35:37.802
It's going to be 50/50,
so it's still a tie, isn't it?

35:50.523 --> 35:53.401
[Jung-bae] Young-il scares me a little.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.362
What do you mean?

35:58.865 --> 36:02.285
[Jung-bae] I don't know how to put this,

36:03.286 --> 36:05.788
but when I was in the room with him
in the last game...

36:07.915 --> 36:08.999
- he...
- [beeps]

36:09.000 --> 36:10.458
[players cheer]

36:10.459 --> 36:13.211
[Dae-ho] That's it! Finally.

36:13.212 --> 36:15.046
[players sigh in relief]

36:15.047 --> 36:16.382
Oh, my God.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.092
We did it.

36:23.222 --> 36:24.598
[Dae-ho] We did it.

36:24.599 --> 36:26.099
It's a tie.

36:26.100 --> 36:29.477
[masked manager] The vote has ended.

36:29.478 --> 36:33.732
[Jeong-dae] Wait, it's a tie.
What happens now?

36:33.733 --> 36:36.067
[masked manager]
Clause three of the consent form.

36:36.068 --> 36:40.447
"In the case of a tie,
players will vote again."

36:40.448 --> 36:44.367
So when are we going to vote again?

36:44.368 --> 36:47.203
[masked manager]
To give you some time to think,

36:47.204 --> 36:50.040
the vote will be conducted tomorrow.

36:50.041 --> 36:54.962
Until then, please think carefully
about your future.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.842
- [players murmuring]
- [ominous music]

37:19.487 --> 37:20.571
[body thuds]

37:23.950 --> 37:27.118
Listen. Maybe we should head back to port.

37:27.119 --> 37:29.913
Isn't it all over if we don't find it
in the next few days?

37:29.914 --> 37:34.085
That's true,
but you should take him to the hospital.

37:34.919 --> 37:37.004
How are you holding up?
Can you push through?

37:37.880 --> 37:39.382
Yes, I'm okay.

37:39.966 --> 37:43.051
His bleeding has stopped,
and I stitched him up. He'll be fine.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.428
[Captain] Still, someone just died.

37:45.429 --> 37:46.805
[Kim] Let's keep going.

37:46.806 --> 37:49.140
He won't be able to rest in peace

37:49.141 --> 37:51.184
until we even the score
with those bastards.

37:51.185 --> 37:54.688
But they've even set up booby traps.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.065
That means they already know
our whereabouts.

37:57.066 --> 37:58.401
[Jun-ho sighs]

37:59.777 --> 38:02.237
From now on, a different radio channel
will be used each day,

38:02.238 --> 38:04.323
and cell phone usage is prohibited.

38:05.074 --> 38:05.949
You heard him.

38:05.950 --> 38:07.118
[mercenaries] Yes, sir.

38:07.702 --> 38:09.161
Please let Team 2 know.

38:23.592 --> 38:25.886
- What were you going to tell me earlier?
- [Jung-bae] What?

38:27.179 --> 38:30.307
About Young-il during the last game.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.311
[In-ho talking indistinctly]

38:35.646 --> 38:38.607
[Dae-ho and Yong-sik talking indistinctly]

38:39.817 --> 38:42.820
I guess it's not him. It's this place
that's making everyone crazy.

38:44.155 --> 38:47.825
We have to get out of here.
I might go crazy too if I stay any longer.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.876
[Dae-ho] You know, Young-il.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.211
I thought you might vote in favor,
like on day one.

39:00.212 --> 39:03.591
I was so nervous, I couldn't watch.

39:04.341 --> 39:06.217
Jung-bae also said something weird--

39:06.218 --> 39:07.887
[Jung-bae] Just eat.

39:08.471 --> 39:09.972
Aren't you hungry?

39:11.849 --> 39:14.768
Thank you, Young-il.
You gave us another chance.

39:14.769 --> 39:17.480
No, I just wanted to stay alive.

39:20.107 --> 39:24.487
The money is enough now too,
so I should get out of here.

39:25.780 --> 39:26.614
Alive.

39:29.075 --> 39:33.913
But do you think
we'll be able to win the second vote?

39:34.955 --> 39:36.373
[In-ho] We'll have to go for broke.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.293
Like Gi-hun said earlier,

39:40.169 --> 39:44.423
we should try to convince some of them
to change their minds

39:45.299 --> 39:46.842
before the second vote.

39:47.468 --> 39:48.968
[Yong-sik] Will they though?

39:48.969 --> 39:52.847
They seem to have lost their minds
over the money.

39:52.848 --> 39:55.017
The way I see it,
we're more likely to win.

39:55.601 --> 39:58.061
All we've got to eat
is this roll of <i>gimbap</i>.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.605
Everyone will be so hungry tomorrow.

40:00.606 --> 40:05.111
When you're hungry,
you start to miss home.

40:07.863 --> 40:08.697
Hey!

40:10.449 --> 40:13.118
Don't agonize over your decision
while eating this dry <i>gimbap</i>.

40:13.119 --> 40:16.204
I just want one of you
to come over to our side.

40:16.205 --> 40:19.874
If we get out of here tomorrow morning,

40:19.875 --> 40:21.877
we could get Korean beef!

40:22.586 --> 40:25.213
I'll tell you what. It's my treat!

40:25.214 --> 40:27.257
And after that, the noodles are on me!

40:27.258 --> 40:29.259
[Dae-ho] Come over to our side! Anyone!

40:29.260 --> 40:30.802
- Come on over!
- [players shouting]

40:30.803 --> 40:33.889
Once you all die in the next game,

40:34.515 --> 40:37.268
we can all leave with 800 million each!

40:37.810 --> 40:42.313
With 800 million,
we could buy a freaking cattle ranch!

40:42.314 --> 40:44.315
- [man 1] That's right!
- [man 2] You can join us!

40:44.316 --> 40:47.443
- [Yeong-sam] That's right! Come on over!
- [man 3] Come over to our side!

40:47.444 --> 40:49.696
You'll get 800 million?
Who are you kidding?

40:49.697 --> 40:52.490
Do you think you'll still be alive
after the next game?

40:52.491 --> 40:55.326
If you don't get out now,
you're all going to die!

40:55.327 --> 40:59.914
So let's play one more game
to see who dies.

40:59.915 --> 41:02.458
Stop trying to run away
like a goddamn coward.

41:02.459 --> 41:03.626
[Dae-ho chuckles]

41:03.627 --> 41:06.838
What did you say? Hey, come here.

41:06.839 --> 41:08.298
Come here, asshole!

41:08.299 --> 41:09.924
- Let's go.
- I'll take you down, chump!

41:09.925 --> 41:12.136
- [Jung-bae] Not with civilians.
- Come here.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.181
I was in the Marines, fucking asshole!

41:16.182 --> 41:18.308
[players laugh mockingly]

41:18.309 --> 41:22.270
[Yeong-sam] Oh, yeah?
Then I was in the air force, fucker!

41:22.271 --> 41:26.524
[Player 336] Hey, if you want to go home,
why would you even bother eating?

41:26.525 --> 41:28.401
Just starve!

41:28.402 --> 41:29.652
[Yeong-sam] That's it.

41:29.653 --> 41:31.238
[players clamoring]

41:32.781 --> 41:34.825
- [Yeong-sam] Come on, fuckers!
- [man 3] You fucker!

41:46.670 --> 41:48.672
[dark music]

42:00.601 --> 42:01.894
[Thanos] <i>Min-su.</i>

42:02.686 --> 42:04.313
I know you're upset with me.

42:05.022 --> 42:06.565
[in English] I'm sorry, boy!

42:07.441 --> 42:11.527
[in Korean] But still, you shouldn't have
betrayed me. That really hurt.

42:11.528 --> 42:14.113
- Open the door.
- [Nam-gyu] Hey, Min-su.

42:14.114 --> 42:17.909
You said you got scammed in a rental deal
and have no place to go anyway.

42:17.910 --> 42:19.452
[Thanos] Open the door!

42:19.453 --> 42:20.954
[Nam-gyu] Let's play one more game.

42:20.955 --> 42:24.040
We'll protect you. I swear.

42:24.041 --> 42:27.460
So when we vote again tomorrow,
press O, all right? Come here.

42:27.461 --> 42:31.131
[Thanos in English] Whoa, boy.
Sit the fuck down.

42:32.383 --> 42:33.509
[in Korean] Look, Min-su.

42:34.760 --> 42:38.472
Before I came here,
I went to a bridge to kill myself.

42:39.181 --> 42:40.932
But on that bridge,

42:40.933 --> 42:44.728
a man in a suit came
and gave me that card.

42:45.604 --> 42:47.064
You got one too, didn't you?

42:47.690 --> 42:48.524
Yes.

42:49.358 --> 42:52.361
I don't have a religion, but it felt like...

42:53.904 --> 42:56.490
like divine intervention.

42:57.074 --> 43:00.368
It felt like I was being given
a chance at a whole new life.

43:00.369 --> 43:03.288
So I decided to give it my best shot

43:03.289 --> 43:05.290
and make my mom proud.

43:05.291 --> 43:07.501
But you're stopping me from doing that.

43:08.085 --> 43:10.003
It makes me fucking furious!

43:10.004 --> 43:12.130
[in English] I'm so fucking angry, man!

43:12.131 --> 43:13.215
[Myung-gi] Knock it off.

43:20.431 --> 43:22.932
Mind your own damn business and fuck off.

43:22.933 --> 43:24.600
You're interfering with the vote.

43:24.601 --> 43:28.271
The Amazing Myung-gi.
Who do you think you are?

43:28.272 --> 43:30.023
The election commissioner?

43:30.024 --> 43:31.066
MG Coin.

43:32.401 --> 43:36.572
You're next,
so just take a piss and get out.

43:38.699 --> 43:43.661
[loudly] Everyone on Team X!
These guys are threatening one of us!

43:43.662 --> 43:46.414
They're forcing him to vote O next time!

43:46.415 --> 43:50.336
[Player 047] Is that true?
Hey, that's cheating.

43:51.045 --> 43:55.673
[Player 145] You kids are still so young.
Who taught you to do something so nasty?

43:55.674 --> 44:00.678
[loudly] Hey! Team O!

44:00.679 --> 44:03.097
These Xs are about to attack us!

44:03.098 --> 44:06.142
[Player 442] What the fuck?
Why would they attack us?

44:06.143 --> 44:08.353
[Player 145] Shut your trap.

44:08.354 --> 44:12.607
[man 1] You damn wimps.
Just shut up and take a piss!

44:12.608 --> 44:14.276
[man 2] I already did, asshole.

44:16.153 --> 44:16.987
Min-su, come here.

44:19.740 --> 44:20.866
MG Coin.

44:21.950 --> 44:23.118
Are you high?

44:24.620 --> 44:26.038
Have you lost your mind?

44:26.997 --> 44:30.458
[Nam-gyu] It's because of her, isn't it?
We saw him with some bitch earlier.

44:30.459 --> 44:33.504
It looked like they were a thing, remember?

44:35.756 --> 44:38.342
You little shit. You have time
to fool around with a girl?

44:38.926 --> 44:41.553
[Nam-gyu]
I've been watching her carefully.

44:42.888 --> 44:45.681
She was walking a bit funny,
and her belly looked--

44:45.682 --> 44:48.185
Leave her alone, you bastards!

44:50.104 --> 44:53.106
You're getting all worked up.
So there is something going on.

44:53.107 --> 44:54.316
I'm telling you.

44:55.359 --> 44:56.401
MG Coin.

44:56.402 --> 45:00.488
- [Nam-gyu] Something's going on.
- If you press X again tomorrow,

45:00.489 --> 45:05.077
I'm going to cut off your finger,
give it to her,

45:05.786 --> 45:07.287
[whispering] and ask her out.

45:09.331 --> 45:10.498
[in English] She'll love it.

45:10.499 --> 45:12.418
You asshole!

45:13.210 --> 45:14.378
[Myung-gi groans]

45:16.797 --> 45:18.506
[Myung-gi] You motherfucker!

45:18.507 --> 45:19.924
[intense music]

45:19.925 --> 45:21.635
I'll end you!

45:24.012 --> 45:25.264
[Myung-gi grunts]

45:31.770 --> 45:32.980
[Min-su whimpering]

45:35.441 --> 45:36.983
[Thanos grunting]

45:36.984 --> 45:42.156
Your money, your girl, your life,
they're all mine.

45:43.240 --> 45:45.408
It all belongs to me, Thanos the great!

45:45.409 --> 45:46.452
[Myung-gi straining]

45:48.454 --> 45:53.208
You fucking... You son of a fucking bitch!

45:54.626 --> 45:56.336
- [Thanos grunting]
- [Myung-gi straining]

46:01.300 --> 46:02.843
- [stabbing]
- [music stops]

46:05.762 --> 46:07.598
[intense music]

46:11.685 --> 46:13.687
[closing theme music playing]

48:31.450 --> 48:36.455
