WEBVTT

00:42.750 --> 00:46.208
Ah. I love a good junkyard.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.875
[grunts] We'll definitely find
a spare compressor here.

00:52.375 --> 00:54.375
Among other things.

00:54.458 --> 00:56.166
[chuckles] You got that right.

01:03.291 --> 01:04.291
[grunts]

01:07.458 --> 01:08.583
[grunts]

01:11.291 --> 01:12.333
Yes!

01:20.125 --> 01:23.958
Well, got the compressor.
You find anything good?

01:24.041 --> 01:25.708
Check it out.

01:25.791 --> 01:28.458
Ooh. [chuckles] Yeah.

01:33.916 --> 01:38.500
Suddenly, I felt its tentacles
wrap around my legs,

01:38.583 --> 01:40.916
-pulling me down into the depths.
-[both gasp]

01:41.500 --> 01:44.583
I had no choice
but to fend off the Octomorph.

01:44.666 --> 01:46.958
-Bare-handed.
-[Bolo, Ketch gasp]

01:47.041 --> 01:49.375
This story changes
every time she tells it.

01:49.458 --> 01:52.625
Vanquishing the creature,
I swam to the coral cave.

01:52.708 --> 01:54.541
And do you know what I found?

01:54.625 --> 01:55.708
What'd you find?

01:55.791 --> 01:58.041
-What? What was there?
-Spit it out!

01:58.541 --> 02:00.666
Only the Grand Pearl of Novak.

02:00.750 --> 02:02.625
[both] Whoa! [chuckling]

02:02.708 --> 02:04.375
Those two will believe anything.

02:04.958 --> 02:10.916
[chuckles] Mission accomplished!
One compressor, as requested. [chuckles]

02:11.000 --> 02:12.791
Ah. Nicely done, Wrecker.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.916
[Omega] That's not all we got.

02:15.000 --> 02:18.583
This assortment, however,
could have been left at the junkyard.

02:18.666 --> 02:22.166
Easy, quick draw.
Let the expert take a look.

02:24.875 --> 02:28.375
It is a manifold regulator.
And a broken one at that.

02:28.458 --> 02:30.833
[Phee] Thanks, Clone Obvious.

02:33.375 --> 02:34.458
Hang on.

02:45.375 --> 02:48.083
These look like coordinate markings.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.750
[gasps] Coordinate markings?

02:51.416 --> 02:54.916
-Mel, take a look at this.
-[beeping]

03:02.083 --> 03:03.708
[beeps]

03:04.833 --> 03:07.375
I was right. This is a compass.

03:08.166 --> 03:10.250
One from long before our time.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.416
[beeping]

03:13.333 --> 03:16.333
These coordinates are
in the Kaldar Trinary system.

03:16.416 --> 03:18.750
[datapad beeps]

03:18.833 --> 03:21.500
I have no record of that system.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.666
Because the best treasures
usually aren't found on maps.

03:25.750 --> 03:27.416
There's treasure there?

03:27.916 --> 03:29.791
Without a doubt.

03:29.875 --> 03:34.291
This compass is a rare find.
You've got a good eye.

03:34.375 --> 03:36.875
Let's go check it out. You heard Phee.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.208
She says a lot of things.

03:39.791 --> 03:42.750
I can go alone
and take the spoils for myself.

03:43.291 --> 03:47.750
Or we go together and split it 50-50.

03:47.833 --> 03:51.708
Please, Hunter.
What if there really is treasure there?

03:51.791 --> 03:54.208
Yeah. We're not on a mission.

03:54.291 --> 03:55.541
It could be fun.

03:56.125 --> 04:00.708
The last time we went after treasure,
it didn't go as planned.

04:00.791 --> 04:03.041
You weren't working
with a professional then.

04:03.125 --> 04:04.125
[Mel beeps]

04:04.208 --> 04:05.291
What do you say?

04:10.750 --> 04:11.750
[sighs]

04:22.625 --> 04:25.333
How many uncharted planets
have you been to?

04:26.041 --> 04:27.416
Too many to count.

04:27.916 --> 04:30.583
That's why I need Mel
to keep track of all the legends

04:30.666 --> 04:32.791
-I've chased down over the years.
-[Mel beeps]

04:33.291 --> 04:35.166
That's the life of a treasure hunter.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.625
Don't you mean "pirate"?

04:37.708 --> 04:41.625
I prefer "Liberator of Ancient Wonders."

04:42.583 --> 04:45.541
Wanna hear about the time
I found the Blade of Zakata Par?

04:45.625 --> 04:46.916
Yes, I do!

04:47.500 --> 04:49.250
-[Phee] It's an exciting story…
-[sighs]

04:49.333 --> 04:50.375
[Phee] …so strap in.

05:12.666 --> 05:14.666
[datapad beeping]

05:24.958 --> 05:28.208
[Tech] I'm not picking up
any signs of civilization whatsoever.

05:28.291 --> 05:29.291
Which makes sense,

05:29.375 --> 05:33.208
considering this land appears
to have been razed and left uninhabitable.

05:33.791 --> 05:35.750
Who'd wanna hide treasure here?

05:35.833 --> 05:36.833
[compass beeping]

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
What was that?

05:40.666 --> 05:42.958
The compass just activated.

05:45.208 --> 05:47.208
[beeping continues]

05:58.333 --> 05:59.750
[beeping faster]

05:59.833 --> 06:02.250
It's telling us to go south.

06:02.333 --> 06:03.541
Let's go!

06:04.833 --> 06:07.250
Now she's got the right attitude.

06:07.875 --> 06:08.916
Wait up, kid!

06:24.416 --> 06:26.416
[compass beeping]

06:29.708 --> 06:31.708
[beeping faster]

06:36.000 --> 06:37.583
[Mel beeps]

06:40.750 --> 06:44.083
[beeping faster]

06:44.166 --> 06:45.416
[beeping stops]

06:46.000 --> 06:48.166
[grunts] It's a dead end.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.291
Maybe we go around the mountain?

06:55.875 --> 06:58.458
Or it's telling us to go inside it.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.166
[wind blowing]

07:18.833 --> 07:20.458
Big guy, help me move this.

07:24.416 --> 07:28.083
[grunting]

07:28.166 --> 07:30.166
[rumbling]

07:31.250 --> 07:33.291
[rocks falling]

07:41.041 --> 07:43.958
Look! It's a secret entrance.

07:44.583 --> 07:47.375
[Wrecker] Oh! It is a secret entrance.

07:54.625 --> 07:59.166
[creature growling]

08:05.583 --> 08:07.000
Whoa!

08:12.375 --> 08:14.791
[datapad beeping]

08:18.000 --> 08:22.041
Hunter, these etchings
are easily a thousand years old.

08:22.125 --> 08:25.125
Older. Much older.

08:26.333 --> 08:29.208
If I'm right, which is always,

08:29.791 --> 08:33.957
we are standing in the entranceway
to Skara Nal.

08:35.207 --> 08:36.457
[Echo] To what?

08:36.541 --> 08:40.541
Every pirate out there's heard
the legend of Skara Nal.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.666
It traces back to the ancients.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.291
[Echo] You mean the Jedi?

08:44.958 --> 08:47.291
No. Older.

08:47.375 --> 08:50.291
So, what kinda treasure's in there?

08:50.375 --> 08:52.750
The Heart of the Mountain.

08:53.750 --> 08:56.250
And we're going to liberate it.

09:04.750 --> 09:05.833
How do we get in?

09:07.916 --> 09:08.916
It's a pattern.

09:13.166 --> 09:15.541
We need to align the symbols
in the right order.

09:21.958 --> 09:23.750
[stone grinding]

09:39.833 --> 09:41.666
Some help would be nice.

09:53.250 --> 09:54.458
[rumbling]

09:54.541 --> 09:56.541
[Hunter] That doesn't sound good.

09:56.625 --> 09:58.166
[rumbling continues]

10:03.208 --> 10:04.208
[Wrecker grunts]

10:06.708 --> 10:09.333
-[rumbling stops]
-[Wrecker coughs, groans]

10:11.125 --> 10:14.125
Booby traps. Now it's getting interesting.

10:14.625 --> 10:16.416
You've just trapped us in here.

10:17.875 --> 10:20.208
Relax. There's always a way out.

10:20.791 --> 10:23.458
We just have to find it.
It's part of the puzzle.

10:35.708 --> 10:39.666
[gasps] Wait!
We're aligning the wrong symbols!

10:45.083 --> 10:46.125
[Hunter] What do you see?

10:46.625 --> 10:49.166
Some of the symbols are glowing.

10:52.208 --> 10:55.333
Here. Lay the compass on my lantern.

10:57.666 --> 10:59.500
[Wrecker] Whoa!

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
[stone grinding]

11:12.875 --> 11:13.875
[grinding stops]

11:47.791 --> 11:51.291
-Mel, note the coordinates and wait here.
-[beeps]

11:52.041 --> 11:54.958
Come on, kid. Time to go exploring.

11:57.833 --> 12:00.708
Looks like we're doing this. [chuckles]

12:02.041 --> 12:03.833
[Tech] My interest is certainly piqued.

12:12.041 --> 12:15.250
[beeping]

12:22.083 --> 12:26.166
So, what exactly is
the Heart of the Mountain?

12:26.250 --> 12:28.791
A rare crystalline stone.

12:29.291 --> 12:32.458
Some say it's the key to an ancient power,

12:32.541 --> 12:36.666
which makes it worth more
than you could possibly fathom.

12:38.416 --> 12:42.291
[Tech] I have run a preliminary analysis
of the minerals in those stone slabs.

12:42.375 --> 12:44.166
They predate the Republic.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.250
Phee may be onto something.

12:48.708 --> 12:52.208
Hey, tough guys. Want to pick up the pace?

12:54.958 --> 12:56.250
Hunter?

12:56.333 --> 12:59.666
[creature growls]

13:05.750 --> 13:06.916
[roars]

13:08.083 --> 13:09.625
[gasps]

13:09.708 --> 13:12.208
It's drooling on me!

13:12.291 --> 13:14.041
[creature growls]

13:20.166 --> 13:21.166
[creature screeches]

13:24.791 --> 13:26.458
[rumbling]

13:34.041 --> 13:37.416
[Omega coughing]

13:39.916 --> 13:44.000
-Echo, Tech, Wrecker, are you okay?
-[Wrecker groaning]

13:46.166 --> 13:49.041
[Echo] We're fine,
but there's too much debris.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.416
We can't get through.

13:55.916 --> 14:00.291
[Tech] The readings in here are not
as clear, but I can track your position.

14:03.041 --> 14:05.416
There are smaller side tunnels throughout.

14:05.500 --> 14:08.375
We will navigate a path
and rendezvous with you at the other end.

14:08.458 --> 14:10.833
Good.
Then we'll keep looking for the treasure.

14:12.833 --> 14:15.458
What? That's what we're here for.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.291
They'll be fine. Come on.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.458
Fortune awaits.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.416
[creature growling in distance]

14:44.458 --> 14:46.000
[Hunter] We need to keep moving.

15:03.416 --> 15:04.500
Hang on.

15:05.875 --> 15:07.625
This is too easy.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.333
[gasps] Look, there are more markings.

15:14.083 --> 15:14.916
Wait!

15:15.500 --> 15:16.833
-[Hunter shouts]
-Hunter!

15:22.375 --> 15:23.375
[grunts]

15:26.500 --> 15:27.708
[Hunter grunts]

15:27.791 --> 15:28.791
[Omega grunts]

15:29.750 --> 15:32.208
[Hunter panting]

15:35.500 --> 15:40.333
I think we need to find a way
to walk across the ceiling.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.500
My thoughts exactly.

15:42.583 --> 15:46.250
[Hunter breathing heavily]
You're just making this up as you go.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.333
[Phee] It's part of the fun.

15:48.833 --> 15:50.125
[Hunter groans]

15:50.208 --> 15:53.708
[Phee] Loosen up, Bandana.
You're in good hands.

15:53.791 --> 15:57.250
[Hunter] We have almost died
three times already.

15:57.333 --> 16:00.583
[Phee] This reminds me of the time
I tracked down the Belmont diadem--

16:00.666 --> 16:01.875
[Hunter] I don't care.

16:01.958 --> 16:05.708
Ooh. Someone's in a mood.

16:05.791 --> 16:06.791
[sighs]

16:07.625 --> 16:11.666
I'm only interested in getting us
outta here in one piece.

16:11.750 --> 16:12.750
It fits.

16:21.375 --> 16:23.625
[stone grinding]

16:32.750 --> 16:33.750
[grinding stops]

16:45.708 --> 16:46.958
All clear.

16:49.583 --> 16:50.708
The compass.

16:51.250 --> 16:53.166
[grunts] I can't get it.

16:55.125 --> 16:58.416
[Phee] It's served its purpose.
Skara Nal's reclaimed it.

17:00.791 --> 17:03.708
[exhales] Skara Nal has reclaimed it.

17:05.750 --> 17:11.040
So, we have to navigate
this death trap without it?

17:11.125 --> 17:12.958
Good thing you have me.

17:14.165 --> 17:15.540
[Hunter sighs]

17:31.083 --> 17:32.583
[Wrecker] How much further?

17:32.666 --> 17:33.666
[datapad beeps]

17:33.750 --> 17:37.625
[Tech] Uncertain. Something ahead
is interfering with my scans.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.666
-[comm beeps]
-[Echo] Hunter, come in.

17:39.750 --> 17:41.458
[static on comm]

17:41.541 --> 17:43.166
-Comms are down too.
-[bang echoes]

17:43.250 --> 17:46.375
[Wrecker] Did you hear that?
I-It's that thing.

17:46.458 --> 17:48.000
[Echo] It's in your head, Wrecker.

18:11.458 --> 18:13.375
[Hunter] What took you so long?

18:13.458 --> 18:15.750
Phee thinks we're getting close
to the treasure.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.458
[Tech] What type of puzzle is this?

18:24.666 --> 18:26.541
[Phee] Don't overthink it, brown eyes.

18:30.708 --> 18:32.375
Sometimes a door's…

18:36.000 --> 18:37.250
just a door.

18:56.375 --> 19:00.416
There. The Heart of the Mountain.

19:40.541 --> 19:42.541
[rumbling]

19:44.625 --> 19:46.625
[rumbling intensifies]

19:51.500 --> 19:52.500
[Wrecker] Go! Go!

20:20.416 --> 20:21.833
[Wrecker shouts]

20:25.750 --> 20:29.666
-[rumbling continues]
-[beeping]

20:34.583 --> 20:37.916
[metal creaking]

20:44.125 --> 20:46.958
I suspect this is not, in fact,
a treasure vault.

20:47.041 --> 20:48.125
Then what is it?

20:48.208 --> 20:49.583
[Echo] Good question.

21:07.250 --> 21:10.083
[Tech] It just emitted
a massive surge of energy.

21:10.166 --> 21:12.875
Whatever we are standing inside
is highly destructive!

21:12.958 --> 21:15.083
[Wrecker] So what do we do
to shut it down?

21:15.166 --> 21:17.666
[Tech] If removing
the Heart of the Mountain activated it,

21:17.750 --> 21:21.750
perhaps we must return it
to its proper place to deactivate it.

21:21.833 --> 21:26.416
Do you know how much this is worth?
It's what we came for!

21:26.500 --> 21:28.958
Can't you find a separate kill switch
or something?

21:29.041 --> 21:30.750
Our ship's out there.

21:30.833 --> 21:34.166
If that thing destroys it,
we'll be trapped on this planet!

21:35.041 --> 21:37.541
All right. But you owe me.

21:37.625 --> 21:38.875
[creature growling]

21:41.875 --> 21:42.916
[growls]

21:44.833 --> 21:46.833
[growling]

21:52.125 --> 21:54.833
[Phee] You deal with that!
I'll get the stone.

22:10.375 --> 22:13.375
[energy weapon powering up]

22:15.291 --> 22:16.291
[grunts]

22:20.791 --> 22:22.666
[mech creaks]

22:28.916 --> 22:31.416
[Hunter grunting]

22:35.541 --> 22:38.500
-[exhales] Man.
-Come on. We're not out of this yet.

22:39.583 --> 22:41.583
[beeping]

22:52.250 --> 22:54.083
[shrieks]

23:00.291 --> 23:01.958
[creature growling]

23:16.666 --> 23:18.416
Shoot the window!

23:25.541 --> 23:27.000
[growls]

23:27.083 --> 23:29.833
[mech groans, thuds]

23:29.916 --> 23:31.500
Tech, do something!

23:32.583 --> 23:34.958
I am trying, but nothing is working!

23:41.708 --> 23:44.708
[creaks, groans]

23:44.791 --> 23:46.791
Tech, the stone!

23:55.541 --> 23:56.541
[Tech grunts]

23:58.541 --> 24:01.541
[powers down]

24:13.791 --> 24:15.375
[rumbling]

24:21.083 --> 24:22.583
[Hunter] Hang on to something!

24:58.041 --> 25:00.875
[Tech] This puts us at 0 for 2
in treasure hunting,

25:00.958 --> 25:03.333
even with a professional.

25:04.333 --> 25:06.416
We did find the Heart of the Mountain.

25:07.416 --> 25:09.500
The legend was real.

25:10.500 --> 25:12.500
Now that's the right attitude.

25:22.375 --> 25:25.500
At least no one can ever activate
that thing again.

25:26.208 --> 25:31.458
So, what you're saying is,
it's a good thing we came after all?

25:32.208 --> 25:33.500
Sorry about Mel.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.541
This happens all the time.

25:35.625 --> 25:38.833
That's why I keep Mel's memory stored
on my ship's data bank.

25:38.916 --> 25:41.833
I'll have her rebuilt
before we head to Vadnay.

25:41.916 --> 25:43.208
What's on Vadnay?

25:44.250 --> 25:48.500
I have a lead on a certain chalice.
Very ancient.

25:49.458 --> 25:50.750
Really?

25:51.958 --> 25:57.333
[Phee] Legend has it the chalice once
belonged to the Kingdom of Elweys,

25:57.416 --> 25:59.833
lost over a millennia ago.

26:00.333 --> 26:04.000
[Omega] Wow. Kingdom of Elweys.
