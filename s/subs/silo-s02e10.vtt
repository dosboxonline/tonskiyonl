WEBVTT

00:27.236 --> 00:28.319
Alive?

00:28.320 --> 00:31.365
We don't know if it's true,
not a hundred-percent,

00:31.865 --> 00:35.576
but an Up-Topper
claiming to be Bernard's shadow

00:35.577 --> 00:38.330
snuck down and he told me that...

00:39.373 --> 00:41.582
when Jules was last seen,
she was still alive.

00:41.583 --> 00:42.709
Where?

00:43.752 --> 00:45.503
- Outside?
- I don't know.

00:45.504 --> 00:46.922
But it gives us hope.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.883
Not that you ever lost it.

00:51.134 --> 00:54.429
A lot of people come through those doors
saying my Juliette is alive.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.474
They chant it on the stairs,

00:58.016 --> 00:59.518
carve it into the walls...

01:01.687 --> 01:03.981
but you're the first people
I actually believe.

01:10.988 --> 01:13.030
We're out of gloves. I tell you that?

01:13.031 --> 01:17.451
We're understaffed.
I haven't slept really, not--

01:17.452 --> 01:19.788
Dr. Nichols, we need you
for something urgent.

01:22.416 --> 01:26.627
I'm providing medical services
to every soul below the barricade

01:26.628 --> 01:28.297
during a time of rebellion.

01:29.381 --> 01:31.383
What could possibly be more pressing?

01:34.011 --> 01:35.095
War.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.735
Okay. I got it.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.446
Let's go.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.033
- This is my lunch box.
- Jimmy.

01:56.533 --> 01:57.576
What?

01:58.076 --> 01:59.411
- You okay?
- Yeah.

02:00.204 --> 02:02.372
I just haven't been in here
in a long time.

02:03.415 --> 02:06.835
The last time I was in here
was the last time I saw my mom.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.759
It goes right there.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.182
I remember.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.185
They were standing...

02:26.480 --> 02:27.481
there.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.371
They were younger than me.

02:44.081 --> 02:45.791
I mean, than I am now.

02:50.462 --> 02:52.214
I got so old.

02:56.426 --> 02:57.678
It's been so long.

03:04.768 --> 03:10.691
My mom, she wanted me to sit in my chair
and eat my lunch like--

03:12.109 --> 03:14.486
like... it was just like a normal day.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.867
Were you an only child?

03:22.244 --> 03:24.162
No sisters, brothers?

03:24.872 --> 03:26.956
- No.
- Are there more suits?

03:26.957 --> 03:29.667
If you had one when you were a kid,
maybe it could fit me?

03:29.668 --> 03:33.046
No, I never saw a suit for me
but my dad had that one

03:33.630 --> 03:37.383
and then my mom had one made,
but I don't see it anywhere.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.510
Jimmy.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.595
We need to go.

03:40.596 --> 03:45.308
Can I-- Is it okay if I just
spend a little time in here?

03:45.309 --> 03:46.685
Just a little bit?

03:48.937 --> 03:50.189
But I'm leaving soon.

03:50.689 --> 03:51.899
I know.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.185
"Safeguard Procedure."

04:31.980 --> 04:34.106
- How far do you have to walk?
- The air will get you

04:34.107 --> 04:36.108
- before you take your first step--
- Yeah, I just want to know.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.694
- It's not too far, but--
- Hey!

04:38.695 --> 04:40.112
What?

04:40.113 --> 04:42.281
- There's something you have to see.
- No, I have to get going.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.741
Oh, no! That's why you have to see it.

04:43.742 --> 04:47.411
What I have to show you, it might
be the only way to save your silo.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.664
Come on!

04:49.164 --> 04:50.541
Come on, come on, come on!

05:04.513 --> 05:05.722
Fuck.

05:19.570 --> 05:22.363
Hey, it's Mr. Blue ID Guy.

05:22.364 --> 05:23.574
Can I see it?

05:25.409 --> 05:26.451
Okay. Here.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.747
"Lukas." Right.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.667
- You're coming with me.
- No, I need to get up top.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.920
Shirley told me to find someone
named Lukas and lock him up.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.214
- Look, you have no idea--
- Probably not.

05:40.215 --> 05:41.383
But I don't care.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.595
You wanna walk or be dragged?

05:45.596 --> 05:46.680
Just--

05:48.891 --> 05:49.892
Dragged it is.

05:51.143 --> 05:52.602
Son of a bitch.

05:52.603 --> 05:53.729
Fuck, man. Sorry.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.654
You all right?

06:03.655 --> 06:05.324
Yeah, we're good.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.204
What am I looking at?

06:11.205 --> 06:13.706
Something we've been hoping
to avoid for some time now.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.459
- What do you mean we? I never saw this.
- Nobody has.

06:16.460 --> 06:19.420
There's gunpowder rolling down
the hallway, so somebody has.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.756
They only know what they need to.
Not all of it.

06:21.757 --> 06:24.217
The people in this room
are the people we trust.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.344
What's the plan?

06:26.803 --> 06:27.929
Look, it's a risk.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.223
The odds are not in our favor.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.099
That's not a good place to start.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.227
But in our present situation,

06:34.228 --> 06:37.772
the chances of long-term survival,
they're not much better.

06:37.773 --> 06:39.690
Resources are running out.

06:39.691 --> 06:42.068
It's only a matter of time
before they take back the farm,

06:42.069 --> 06:45.112
so it's kind of now or never.

06:45.113 --> 06:48.908
I wouldn't have said this when we started,
but now they need to know

06:48.909 --> 06:51.578
that we are willing to risk everything.

06:52.204 --> 06:53.955
And by everything?

06:53.956 --> 06:56.458
The only thing we have for leverage.

06:57.209 --> 07:00.127
In one hour, I'm gonna lead a team
that will storm the barricade.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.046
Shirley will follow with a second wave.

07:02.047 --> 07:04.632
But our goal isn't so much to win
at the barricade.

07:04.633 --> 07:05.967
- Then what are we--
- Bu--

07:05.968 --> 07:09.303
But to hold off the raiders
for at least three hours.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.597
Why three?

07:14.518 --> 07:18.229
'Cause that's how long it takes
to rig the generator to explode.

07:18.230 --> 07:22.066
- You're going to blow up the generator?
- If we don't get what we want.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.777
If you don't get what you want,
you're gonna kill everybody?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.196
- We're not gonna kill everybody.
- What do you want, Sheriff?

07:27.197 --> 07:30.367
- I want to know the truth.
- They won't give it to us.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.288
Not unless they have to.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.374
Three hours.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.709
That's all we need.

07:39.710 --> 07:41.712
But the timeline stays in this room,

07:42.421 --> 07:45.757
because if somebody from the Up Top
finds out, this will all be for nothing.

07:57.019 --> 07:58.645
I'll go with the first wave.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.274
Got you.

08:04.651 --> 08:07.403
Send your raiders to storm the barricades,
arrest the rebels

08:07.404 --> 08:09.322
and secure the generator room now.

08:09.323 --> 08:11.033
- How many should I send?
- All of them.

08:11.950 --> 08:12.951
Go!

10:17.951 --> 10:19.494
What the hell was that all about?

10:20.621 --> 10:21.705
I don't know.

10:24.917 --> 10:25.918
What the fuck is that?

10:30.923 --> 10:32.174
Go, go, go, go!

10:32.799 --> 10:34.092
Fuck.

10:42.768 --> 10:43.977
- Run!
- What?

10:44.478 --> 10:45.312
Stop...

10:45.812 --> 10:48.982
Stop! Stop. You don't understand!

10:51.735 --> 10:54.404
Come on. It's here.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.281
- It's in here somewhere.
- Okay.

10:57.282 --> 10:59.325
- How to save them. It's j--
- What?

10:59.326 --> 11:01.077
Wait, you can't hear this. You gotta go.

11:01.078 --> 11:02.870
- What?
- The Eater has to go!

11:02.871 --> 11:04.664
- Don't call me Eater!
- You're too young to hear this.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.999
- You don't get to call me that!
- It's okay.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.459
It's okay.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.878
What do you want to be called?

11:13.757 --> 11:15.508
My mom called me Hope.

11:15.509 --> 11:19.096
Hope? Okay, that's great.
That's a great name. Hope.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.559
Hey, if you go back to the vault,
we'll be right back, I promise.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.477
Okay?

11:27.729 --> 11:28.897
Sorry.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.148
Jimmy.

11:31.149 --> 11:34.986
Okay, look. It's written here:
"the Safeguard Procedure."

11:34.987 --> 11:37.197
I heard my parents whispering about it.

11:37.990 --> 11:39.241
It could kill people.

11:39.992 --> 11:42.994
But that morning,
they figured out a way to stop it.

11:42.995 --> 11:44.954
- And if you learn it, okay...
- Okay.

11:44.955 --> 11:50.085
...If you know it, then maybe
you can keep your silo from dying.

11:51.920 --> 11:53.963
I remember my mom not coming back

11:53.964 --> 11:57.758
and then... whatever my parents did, worked.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.303
- What?
- My mom and dad saved people's lives.

12:00.304 --> 12:02.598
All those people went outside,
they didn't die.

12:03.348 --> 12:04.474
Not at first.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.851
They didn't die, Juliette.

12:06.852 --> 12:10.105
And you think that whatever they did
could help save my silo?

12:10.981 --> 12:12.273
- Yes!
- Okay.

12:12.274 --> 12:14.610
- It's in here somewhere. We just...
- Okay.

12:17.070 --> 12:17.905
I...

12:19.239 --> 12:21.450
I don't know what I'm looking for.
I just--

12:21.950 --> 12:25.454
Wait. If we're gonna do this,
you have to remember, okay?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.123
- You have to try.
- Okay, okay.

12:29.958 --> 12:30.959
They're coming!

12:33.003 --> 12:35.130
- Go on. Get out of here.
- Fuck.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.310
- Are they down there?
- Yeah.

12:59.488 --> 13:00.739
You with me?

13:01.740 --> 13:03.033
Always.

13:04.535 --> 13:07.454
Then let's fucking go!

13:12.251 --> 13:13.876
- Okay.
- Search every room!

13:13.877 --> 13:15.503
- Are you okay? I'm sorry.
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:15.504 --> 13:17.171
Paul, what's going on?

13:17.172 --> 13:18.256
Find him!

13:18.257 --> 13:19.842
They're coming. So--

13:21.635 --> 13:25.346
Paul Billings, you're under arrest
for a violation of Pact Order 11-24 Delta:

13:25.347 --> 13:27.473
Dereliction of duty with seditious intent.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.601
Wait, wait. There's a child over there.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.772
It's not personal, Paul.

13:34.773 --> 13:35.941
I'm just doing my job,

13:36.608 --> 13:37.651
like you taught me.

13:38.986 --> 13:39.945
Kathleen.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.738
Kathleen!

13:45.576 --> 13:47.368
It is a really inconvenient time
right now.

13:47.369 --> 13:49.413
Maybe you should stop by
when your mom's here--

14:11.393 --> 14:12.519
Let's go.

14:18.567 --> 14:20.776
Restore radio communication in the Silo.

14:20.777 --> 14:21.945
Yes, sir.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.456
You all right, sir?

14:34.833 --> 14:36.043
Yes, I am.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.379
Any luck finding Lukas Kyle?

14:40.005 --> 14:40.923
Not yet.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.143
Did we choose the wrong side?

14:54.144 --> 14:56.146
By delivering Billings's message?

14:57.064 --> 14:58.356
Maybe.

14:58.357 --> 14:59.858
If Bernard finds out,

15:00.943 --> 15:03.529
sending us out to clean
with our son watching

15:04.196 --> 15:06.156
will be the most generous punishment
he'll offer.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.867
Maybe the message will still pay off.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.330
Either way, it's time.

15:14.122 --> 15:17.417
You find a way into the vault
and I'll get our boy.

15:27.803 --> 15:32.390
I remember the vault. I remember
my mom and dad had Solo take me there.

15:32.391 --> 15:33.933
- He's the one who put me in there.
- Right.

15:33.934 --> 15:36.519
Then, a couple of days later,
I remember explosions,

15:36.520 --> 15:39.146
and I remember gunshots
and then I remember the sheriff

15:39.147 --> 15:42.650
bringing my dad back,
but my mom wasn't there.

15:42.651 --> 15:44.152
But then, my dad...

15:44.653 --> 15:47.823
my dad told him that it was safe
to go outside.

15:48.657 --> 15:51.785
He told them that they had
done something to make it safe.

15:52.744 --> 15:53.829
But the sheriff, he--

15:57.165 --> 15:58.875
Sorry, he wanted the truth.

15:58.876 --> 16:01.336
And so my dad told him the tru--

16:07.217 --> 16:08.427
It's a pipe.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.304
The Safeguard is a pipe.

16:11.305 --> 16:12.389
What?

16:13.473 --> 16:14.849
- We have to find it.
- Okay.

16:14.850 --> 16:17.476
You're here for your safety
and the safety of the Silo.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.645
Your peace will be met with kindness.

16:19.646 --> 16:21.898
- Your violence will be met with--
- Shut the fuck up!

16:21.899 --> 16:22.900
Hey!

16:23.400 --> 16:25.109
Hey! Lay off!

16:25.110 --> 16:26.320
You okay?

16:30.908 --> 16:32.201
Teddy.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.829
- Are you okay?
- Of course he is. Look at him.

16:36.330 --> 16:37.456
He's a tough kid.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.208
You did your mama proud.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.043
We were worried about you.

16:46.673 --> 16:48.634
You kicked Randy in the nuts?

16:50.093 --> 16:52.220
Yeah, well, I needed to get up top.

16:52.221 --> 16:53.305
Why?

16:55.098 --> 16:57.059
You're not gonna tell me
what you found down there?

17:00.145 --> 17:02.396
Don't worry, because
it doesn't matter now.

17:02.397 --> 17:06.527
- Tell me--
- It doesn't matter.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.153
It just...

17:12.156 --> 17:14.075
Hi, honey.

17:14.076 --> 17:15.367
What are they gonna do with us?

17:15.368 --> 17:17.370
- Let's just stay calm, keep Claire safe.
- Come with us, Billings.

17:17.371 --> 17:18.872
- Hey, hey!
- It's gonna be okay!

17:21.959 --> 17:24.294
This display, it's all a lie!

17:24.962 --> 17:26.921
This is all bullshit.
You know that, right?

17:26.922 --> 17:28.048
Right?

17:29.091 --> 17:30.759
This display!

17:31.552 --> 17:33.136
It's all lies!

17:34.888 --> 17:36.181
I saw it!

17:36.765 --> 17:38.100
So did some of you.

17:38.809 --> 17:39.976
Nichols showed me.

17:39.977 --> 17:43.145
She was trying to show everyone the truth!

17:43.146 --> 17:44.231
Wait.

17:45.691 --> 17:46.941
I saw it.

17:46.942 --> 17:48.777
A flash of blue and green.

17:49.444 --> 17:52.281
When they shut down the power
to fix the generator, I saw it.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.330
It's safe outside.

18:02.791 --> 18:06.128
Juliette Nichols is alive!

18:07.504 --> 18:09.423
Juliette lives!

18:19.016 --> 18:22.059
Mayor Holland specifically
said they should be in separate cells.

18:22.060 --> 18:25.062
No. Mayor Holland says, "Thank you.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.608
The Silo is grateful
for your co-operation."

18:30.652 --> 18:32.154
You, Walk?

18:34.573 --> 18:35.824
It was the only way.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.912
You both are free to go.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.290
Get the fuck away from me.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.168
I'm not going anywhere.

18:48.086 --> 18:49.754
Well, I have to see him.

18:49.755 --> 18:52.049
For you, I'm sure he'll make time.

18:53.342 --> 18:56.553
I hope he sends you out to clean.

19:24.248 --> 19:27.250
Everybody in this motherfucker
knows Juliette is alive.

19:27.251 --> 19:28.668
It's safe outside and you know it.

19:28.669 --> 19:29.919
- I saw.
- Out of the way.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.295
Hey, hold it.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.840
If I don't get your colleague to
a functioning medical level soon,

19:33.841 --> 19:35.174
he's gonna die on the stairs.

19:35.175 --> 19:36.467
Look, doc, I have orders.

19:36.468 --> 19:37.802
It's okay, Dan, I got it.

19:37.803 --> 19:40.555
Jean, they gave me strict orders
not to let anyone out of here

19:40.556 --> 19:43.516
- until they give the word and they--
- <i>We found gunpowder.</i>

19:43.517 --> 19:46.269
- <i>A lot of it.</i>
- Fuck. Just go, go!

19:46.270 --> 19:47.478
Come on.

19:47.479 --> 19:48.981
What level? Where?

19:49.481 --> 19:51.357
<i>In Mechanical. It's everywhere.</i>

19:51.358 --> 19:52.484
Received.

19:57.906 --> 20:00.533
They had to block it.
They had to put a cap on it.

20:00.534 --> 20:01.994
But they were afraid

20:02.828 --> 20:05.413
- that something would go wrong.
- Why? Why did they have to cap it?

20:05.414 --> 20:07.124
Because it had poison in it.

20:07.708 --> 20:11.003
Enough poison to kill everybody.
All 10,000 people.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.546
We have to find a map of the silo.

20:13.547 --> 20:16.049
Okay. The pipe came from outside.

20:16.884 --> 20:18.635
- Here.
- Wait.

20:22.890 --> 20:24.516
Here.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.394
- There.
- There.

20:30.689 --> 20:32.941
- Here!
- Level 14.

20:34.026 --> 20:35.736
Hey, that's where my mom worked.

20:37.696 --> 20:40.157
- Do you think we should go?
- Fuck yes.

20:47.122 --> 20:49.291
All clear. All clear.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.476
Do it again.

21:08.477 --> 21:11.396
Okay. Watch.

21:14.775 --> 21:16.109
Do it again.

21:26.703 --> 21:28.080
Benny, come here. You gotta try this.

21:33.210 --> 21:34.920
Mmm.

21:56.650 --> 21:57.693
After you.

22:01.989 --> 22:07.995
I understand that your ex-wife didn't
want to have anything to do with you.

22:11.832 --> 22:15.002
Well, at least you're free,
unlike the rest of them.

22:18.630 --> 22:19.589
Drink?

22:19.590 --> 22:20.674
No, thanks.

22:23.218 --> 22:28.055
We have a couple more minutes here
before we get confirmation

22:28.056 --> 22:30.392
that the generator is safe.

22:38.483 --> 22:39.484
Have a seat.

22:52.748 --> 22:53.874
We need to stop.

22:55.459 --> 22:56.543
You guys head up.

22:57.169 --> 22:58.587
Let me know if anyone's coming down.

23:00.881 --> 23:01.882
Come on.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.104
Relax.

23:17.064 --> 23:18.690
They'll come and tell me when it's done.

23:20.275 --> 23:24.780
So, what did you want to see me about?

23:25.531 --> 23:29.076
I wanted to tell you a story
about the generator.

23:30.244 --> 23:33.621
Does every conversation about Mechanical

23:33.622 --> 23:35.832
begin and end with the generator?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.002
That's not where this story ends.

23:52.766 --> 23:55.643
Go see if those rebels
in the cafeteria have settled down.

23:55.644 --> 23:57.436
And see if there's any food.

23:57.437 --> 23:58.813
You sure you're okay here?

23:58.814 --> 24:01.149
These assholes aren't going anywhere.

24:12.411 --> 24:15.037
We're clear above. Are you ready?

24:15.038 --> 24:16.164
Fuck yes.

24:16.665 --> 24:18.249
I'm dying in that thing.

24:18.250 --> 24:20.335
I'll make sure no one's coming from below.

24:41.565 --> 24:42.566
What is it?

24:43.525 --> 24:44.526
What's happened?

24:46.236 --> 24:47.196
It's gone.

24:48.530 --> 24:49.572
The timer.

24:49.573 --> 24:50.824
How?

24:51.700 --> 24:54.661
I don't know, but it's gone.

25:14.014 --> 25:15.015
Hey!

25:15.891 --> 25:16.891
Yeah?

25:16.892 --> 25:18.559
Radio and tell them it's all right.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.020
They didn't connect the bomb.

25:20.687 --> 25:21.729
Thank the Founders.

25:21.730 --> 25:23.648
Listen, we gotta be careful.

25:23.649 --> 25:25.650
No gunfire. No sparks. All right?

25:25.651 --> 25:26.777
Okay!

25:29.738 --> 25:30.739
It's Dan.

25:31.406 --> 25:33.783
Radio Bernard. The bomb is not connected.

25:33.784 --> 25:35.493
<i>See, the generator is loud.</i>

25:35.494 --> 25:37.954
<i>So in order to communicate,
you have to yell.</i>

25:37.955 --> 25:42.333
Over the years, crews have
developed a system of hand signals,

25:42.334 --> 25:44.126
mostly done with one hand.

25:44.127 --> 25:47.631
And they got pretty elaborate.
You can have a whole conversation.

25:49.299 --> 25:51.300
And I taught that to the kids.

25:51.301 --> 25:56.639
So, in my workshop, when you thought
that everything you saw on that camera

25:56.640 --> 25:58.641
<i>was all that was being communicated...</i>

25:58.642 --> 25:59.976
Stop.

25:59.977 --> 26:01.978
<i>...we were actually having
a whole different conversation.</i>

26:01.979 --> 26:03.272
We are being watched.

26:04.356 --> 26:06.358
Okay...

26:14.241 --> 26:15.742
We got your message.

26:42.144 --> 26:43.228
What are you doing?

26:49.109 --> 26:52.279
If she's alive, you give her this.

26:55.407 --> 26:56.825
Tell her I love her.

26:59.536 --> 27:01.455
Tell her to never stop fighting.

27:02.164 --> 27:04.082
Never stop being herself.

27:06.126 --> 27:07.711
Because her whole life...

27:14.051 --> 27:15.302
her whole life...

27:17.513 --> 27:18.889
she's been perfect...

27:20.140 --> 27:21.683
just the way she is.

27:23.602 --> 27:26.563
Doc, let me do it.

27:27.439 --> 27:29.233
Absolutely not.

27:32.069 --> 27:33.362
Go.

27:34.363 --> 27:36.114
- I can't.
- Hey...

27:37.866 --> 27:38.867
go.

27:44.540 --> 27:47.750
My mistake was in putting
my own personal desires

27:47.751 --> 27:50.379
above those of Mechanical, my family.

27:52.965 --> 27:58.428
But that's a mistake
that I hope to rectify...

28:00.138 --> 28:04.183
in five, four, three,

28:04.184 --> 28:06.436
two, one.

28:10.107 --> 28:11.899
The bomb's been neutralized.

28:11.900 --> 28:14.151
We got in before they can connect it.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.153
Fuck.

28:16.697 --> 28:18.907
Wow, that was dramatic.

28:20.242 --> 28:21.493
What was that?

28:22.327 --> 28:24.704
At the end of the little countdown,

28:24.705 --> 28:26.623
were we supposed to lose power?

28:30.169 --> 28:31.712
What was supposed to happen?

29:38.028 --> 29:39.238
What was that?

29:39.738 --> 29:41.448
Something outside.

29:42.533 --> 29:43.867
It felt like it came from--

29:44.368 --> 29:45.369
Yeah.

29:47.996 --> 29:49.413
- You're out of time.
- What?

29:49.414 --> 29:51.040
You need to get home now.

29:51.041 --> 29:52.125
Oh, shit.

29:52.751 --> 29:53.876
What did you do?

29:53.877 --> 29:55.170
Not just me.

29:56.421 --> 29:57.506
All of us.

30:11.770 --> 30:13.480
Put 'em down. Now!

30:18.527 --> 30:20.153
Let's go!

30:23.448 --> 30:24.491
Follow me!

30:30.706 --> 30:31.956
What do you mean gone?

30:31.957 --> 30:34.126
<i>The stairs, between 92 and 90.</i>

30:36.003 --> 30:39.047
They're just gone.

30:53.103 --> 30:55.229
How many raiders are trapped
below the explosion point?

30:55.230 --> 30:57.024
You told me to send them all.

31:05.324 --> 31:06.325
Come on!

31:13.165 --> 31:14.541
Give us the truth!

31:24.426 --> 31:25.552
Kat!

31:27.137 --> 31:28.138
Kat!

31:31.225 --> 31:34.144
- Kat, are you okay?
- Yeah, we're okay.

31:34.728 --> 31:37.856
Good. Okay. Let's keep moving.

31:40.442 --> 31:42.068
- Tell us the truth!
- We know it's a lie.

31:42.069 --> 31:43.987
Give us the truth.

31:44.488 --> 31:46.489
Get whoever you can to protect IT.

31:46.490 --> 31:48.741
Everyone above the explosion
is either defending their position

31:48.742 --> 31:50.117
or abandoning post.

31:50.118 --> 31:51.953
Maybe I can gather some raiders.
Maybe Sims?

31:51.954 --> 31:53.914
Go. Go!

31:54.540 --> 31:55.707
Go!

31:59.920 --> 32:01.420
- Bernard.
- Where have you been?

32:01.421 --> 32:02.922
- Just shut up and listen.
- What?

32:02.923 --> 32:04.632
There's no time, okay?

32:04.633 --> 32:08.594
I need you to look like
we are having a serious conversation.

32:08.595 --> 32:10.597
But just listen. Don't say a word.

32:11.265 --> 32:16.311
Because if it hears this, we're dead.

32:19.481 --> 32:20.774
I solved the code.

32:33.495 --> 32:34.496
It's true.

32:35.247 --> 32:38.375
It's why Meadows quit as your shadow.

32:40.836 --> 32:42.129
It's why I quit.

33:05.402 --> 33:06.445
Boss?

33:38.560 --> 33:40.896
Bernard. Hey, Bernard!

33:41.980 --> 33:43.606
What did Lukas Kyle say to you?

33:43.607 --> 33:44.733
Hello, Rob.

33:45.817 --> 33:46.860
What did he say?

33:51.740 --> 33:52.741
Hey.

33:53.325 --> 33:54.910
You still wanna be my shadow?

33:56.787 --> 33:57.912
What?

33:57.913 --> 33:59.081
You got it.

33:59.748 --> 34:01.083
You're now my shadow.

34:02.501 --> 34:05.504
The code is 552039.

34:08.422 --> 34:09.842
Good luck, Robert.

34:12.844 --> 34:14.429
You were very loyal...

34:17.099 --> 34:18.183
until you weren't.

34:28.694 --> 34:30.861
- Hey, can you get the tape?
- Yeah.

34:30.862 --> 34:31.946
It's in the desk drawer.

34:31.947 --> 34:35.783
I'm gonna need help
to seal the suit once it's on.

34:35.784 --> 34:36.702
So--

34:41.498 --> 34:43.667
No, no, no.

34:49.005 --> 34:50.007
Fuck!

34:50.591 --> 34:52.550
- Fuck!
- Maybe we could fix it. What if we--

34:52.551 --> 34:55.761
How are you gonna fix it? You're probably
the reason that it's ruined anyway.

34:55.762 --> 34:57.972
- How could I be the reason? I wasn't--
- Because you're the Eater.

34:57.973 --> 35:00.474
Just shut up! Stop!

35:00.475 --> 35:02.685
She's the reason our parents are dead.

35:02.686 --> 35:04.604
- No, she's not! No, she's not!
- Yes, she is.

35:04.605 --> 35:07.316
She didn't ask for this. None of us did.

35:08.066 --> 35:09.442
You wanna be angry?

35:09.443 --> 35:14.823
Be angry at the motherfuckers
who built this place and put us in it!

35:15.699 --> 35:16.700
Not us.

35:17.201 --> 35:18.535
Not her.

35:21.663 --> 35:24.290
All we're trying to do is survive.

35:24.291 --> 35:27.543
But the only way we can do that
is by trusting the other people

35:27.544 --> 35:29.795
stuck in the same shit as we are.

35:29.796 --> 35:31.756
But you're not stuck with us though.
You're leaving.

35:31.757 --> 35:34.133
You're damn right I'm leaving.
I'm going home.

35:34.134 --> 35:36.260
'Cause somewhere not too far from here,

35:36.261 --> 35:39.722
the people I love, they might be
killing each other right now.

35:39.723 --> 35:42.266
And those are the people
that I'm stuck with.

35:42.267 --> 35:46.813
My friends. My family. My dad.

35:50.234 --> 35:51.610
Look at what you have.

35:54.238 --> 35:55.447
You've got Rick.

35:56.073 --> 35:57.323
And Benny.

35:57.324 --> 35:58.824
And Tess.

35:58.825 --> 36:00.327
And you have Hope.

36:01.036 --> 36:04.206
Not Eater or whatever asshole name
you wanna give her.

36:05.082 --> 36:08.251
You wanna be angry? Then be angry
but be angry with each other,

36:08.252 --> 36:09.336
not at each other.

36:12.589 --> 36:13.965
This is it.

36:13.966 --> 36:15.716
You're all that's left.

36:15.717 --> 36:18.261
So just make it work.

36:18.262 --> 36:21.473
But you have to make it work
right fucking now.

36:32.943 --> 36:34.235
Right, I have another suit.

36:34.236 --> 36:37.531
I don't even know if it's gonna work,
but I'm gonna have to try. Jimmy, w--

36:38.949 --> 36:40.075
Where's Jimmy?

36:42.744 --> 36:43.787
No.

36:44.705 --> 36:45.622
No.

36:47.541 --> 36:48.833
It's gone.

36:48.834 --> 36:51.670
- When you got mad, Jimmy--
- He left.

36:53.213 --> 36:54.214
He--

37:36.298 --> 37:39.092
- You're back.
- I am.

37:40.093 --> 37:41.261
Are you okay?

37:45.057 --> 37:46.683
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:49.937 --> 37:51.103
What's going on out there?

37:51.104 --> 37:53.397
I heard shouting. The room shook.

37:53.398 --> 37:54.899
It's just a lot of nonsense, okay?

37:54.900 --> 37:57.068
Lukas, what's wrong? What happened?

37:57.069 --> 37:59.238
Everything is okay, Mom. It's--

38:00.697 --> 38:01.907
It's fine.

38:02.491 --> 38:03.951
Did you do what you needed to?

38:09.206 --> 38:10.624
Turns out it didn't need doing.

38:14.127 --> 38:15.128
No.

38:16.421 --> 38:17.840
Let's get you fixed up.

38:24.930 --> 38:25.973
Walk?

38:27.599 --> 38:29.768
- Where's Bernard?
- He left after the explosion.

38:30.269 --> 38:31.811
Almost everyone did.

38:31.812 --> 38:33.647
IT is ours.

38:36.525 --> 38:37.650
I knew it.

38:37.651 --> 38:39.111
The hell you did.

38:39.778 --> 38:42.531
Deep down, I knew.

38:44.783 --> 38:48.453
- What's going on?
- Let's go out!

38:49.121 --> 38:50.622
They're gonna try to go out.

38:54.209 --> 38:55.502
Get out of the way!

38:57.629 --> 38:59.631
Move! Move! Shit!

39:00.465 --> 39:01.466
Jimmy!

39:02.134 --> 39:03.260
Fuck.

39:27.284 --> 39:28.327
Wait.

39:29.328 --> 39:31.245
- Hey. Okay?
- Okay.

39:31.246 --> 39:33.456
What are you doing? What do you--

39:33.457 --> 39:36.542
The helmet seal is airtight

39:36.543 --> 39:38.670
and I used the good tape around my wrists.

39:40.214 --> 39:44.926
I figured if the water didn't come in
and I didn't drown, that it would be okay.

39:44.927 --> 39:46.010
And it worked.

39:46.011 --> 39:49.848
So you can use this one to get back.

39:53.143 --> 39:55.811
- No.
- Okay. Okay.

39:55.812 --> 39:59.024
Hey, just-- Thank you.

40:00.609 --> 40:01.693
Thank you.

40:02.444 --> 40:03.904
- We better get going.
- Yeah.

40:04.404 --> 40:05.405
Okay.

40:33.350 --> 40:34.935
<i>My earliest memory,</i>

40:35.811 --> 40:37.646
I'm under two,

40:39.022 --> 40:44.278
I'm lying in bed next to you
and playing with your hands.

40:45.946 --> 40:47.406
They were so big.

40:49.366 --> 40:50.868
What made you think of that?

40:52.995 --> 40:54.037
I don't know.

40:57.457 --> 40:59.543
Sorry to barge in like this, Mrs. Kyle,

41:00.127 --> 41:02.004
but I need to ask your son something.

41:02.713 --> 41:05.048
What the fuck did you say to Bernard?

41:17.144 --> 41:19.229
Mr. Holland. What's happening?

41:21.106 --> 41:22.107
What do we do?

41:23.192 --> 41:25.693
- We deserve to know. Please.
- Tell us the truth.

41:25.694 --> 41:27.571
You gotta tell us the truth, Mr.--

41:30.574 --> 41:32.242
Get the fuck out.

41:33.619 --> 41:34.703
Out!

41:39.124 --> 41:40.125
Not you.

41:44.421 --> 41:46.464
Okay, Juliette, let's get you suited up.

41:46.465 --> 41:47.549
Yeah.

41:49.927 --> 41:51.053
This work?

41:55.349 --> 41:57.059
Yeah, it's great.

41:58.894 --> 41:59.895
Thanks.

42:01.939 --> 42:02.939
Okay.

42:02.940 --> 42:04.023
Yeah.

42:04.024 --> 42:07.026
It's okay. It's okay.

42:07.027 --> 42:08.529
Hold on.

42:12.074 --> 42:13.283
Coming back, right?

42:14.034 --> 42:15.035
No, I--

42:15.994 --> 42:18.204
To be honest, I don't know
what's gonna happen when I walk outside

42:18.205 --> 42:19.665
so I'm not gonna lie to you.

42:20.582 --> 42:21.708
Okay?

42:26.338 --> 42:30.633
Look, what happened to the parents
is not your fault. You know that, right?

42:30.634 --> 42:33.095
You're strong and you're smart,
and you're capable.

42:33.846 --> 42:35.263
Yeah?

42:35.264 --> 42:36.390
You're gonna be okay.

42:37.099 --> 42:38.350
You all will.

42:42.771 --> 42:45.482
You should go. You shouldn't be here
when we open the door.

42:46.733 --> 42:48.944
Okay.

42:52.990 --> 42:54.324
You're his shadow now?

42:56.410 --> 42:57.494
I am.

42:58.036 --> 42:59.454
He gave you the key?

43:00.539 --> 43:01.540
He did.

43:02.124 --> 43:04.375
Is there any way
you could put that gun away?

43:04.376 --> 43:06.170
- There is not.
- It's okay.

43:08.338 --> 43:12.675
See, the thing about that key,
Bernard made the mistake

43:12.676 --> 43:17.763
of assuming that everything is okay
because it's not lighting up,

43:17.764 --> 43:20.225
but he was wrong.

43:20.934 --> 43:25.898
It's not lighting up because it's over.

43:26.732 --> 43:28.150
What's over?

43:29.359 --> 43:30.777
The rebellion?

43:32.446 --> 43:33.487
No.

43:33.488 --> 43:34.615
Then what?

43:35.574 --> 43:36.658
What did you say?

43:37.910 --> 43:39.328
I can't tell you.

43:41.246 --> 43:42.372
I won't tell you.

43:43.957 --> 43:47.335
Yes, you can kill me and my mother.

43:47.336 --> 43:48.420
Doesn't matter.

43:49.171 --> 43:50.339
You should go.

43:50.839 --> 43:52.465
Go to the vault.

43:52.466 --> 43:55.511
See the Legacy while there is still time.

43:59.097 --> 44:00.432
You'll know it when you see it.

44:01.391 --> 44:02.517
The code is 55--

44:02.518 --> 44:05.103
I know what the fucking code is.

44:20.035 --> 44:21.286
Okay.

44:25.791 --> 44:27.084
Okay.

44:27.751 --> 44:28.876
- Okay.
- Hey,

44:28.877 --> 44:31.964
I know why you said what you said but...

44:34.633 --> 44:36.802
you're gonna come back, right?

44:46.562 --> 44:48.689
Nothing's gonna stop me from trying.

45:14.756 --> 45:18.385
Don't let them through!

45:23.849 --> 45:25.100
Come on!

45:31.106 --> 45:34.818
Teddy! Get me that! Get me that!

45:46.205 --> 45:48.790
Go! Go!

46:07.392 --> 46:11.063
Easy. Easy. Hey, move. It's okay.

46:14.274 --> 46:16.109
Bernard, Bernard.

46:16.693 --> 46:17.693
We need you now.

46:17.694 --> 46:19.737
I don't know what's going through
your head, but we need you to come out.

46:19.738 --> 46:22.615
We need you to tell the people the truth.

46:22.616 --> 46:23.533
Billings!

46:23.534 --> 46:25.117
- Get out of the way!
- Tell them the truth.

46:25.118 --> 46:26.370
Bernard, that's all they need.

46:28.997 --> 46:31.457
- You need to get out of the way.
- Please. One minute.

46:31.458 --> 46:34.378
Let's talk to him. Let's hear him out.
Bernard, please.

46:35.003 --> 46:35.920
- Bernard.
- Take him.

46:35.921 --> 46:40.174
Open the-- Stop, man! Wait! Hear him out.
Let's hear what he has to say, man.

46:40.175 --> 46:41.425
Kennedy, listen!

46:41.426 --> 46:43.803
Let's hear what he has to say. Please!

46:43.804 --> 46:45.805
Don't go outside. Come on!

46:45.806 --> 46:48.308
Bring me the ram!

46:49.685 --> 46:51.936
Let's go! Bring it through!

46:51.937 --> 46:54.940
We're going all the way out.
All the way out.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.109
- Get out of the way!
- Wait!

47:05.409 --> 47:06.410
Is that--

47:14.543 --> 47:15.711
It's gotta be.

47:28.348 --> 47:29.349
It's her.

47:43.906 --> 47:45.324
She lives.

47:54.541 --> 47:58.420
Juliette lives!

49:17.124 --> 49:19.293
Fuck!

50:18.227 --> 50:19.853
<i>Please state your name.</i>

50:21.438 --> 50:23.524
My name is Robert Sims.

50:24.149 --> 50:25.275
Husband to Camille.

50:26.568 --> 50:28.111
Father of Anthony.

50:28.737 --> 50:30.155
<i>Why are you here?</i>

50:31.740 --> 50:33.534
I want to save the Silo.

50:35.244 --> 50:36.703
<i>So do I.</i>

50:38.830 --> 50:42.084
<i>Judge Sims,
you and your son must leave the vault.</i>

50:44.586 --> 50:46.004
<i>Camille can stay.</i>

51:06.859 --> 51:08.026
Hey!

51:09.570 --> 51:11.237
You're gonna shoot me?

51:11.238 --> 51:12.738
Why are you here?

51:12.739 --> 51:15.283
I'm here to keep everyone from going out.

51:15.284 --> 51:18.287
That's-- You're the reason
everyone wants to go out.

51:19.329 --> 51:21.081
If you wanted to shoot me, I'd be dead.

51:22.958 --> 51:25.752
- Why are you here, Bernard?
- I just want to go outside.

51:27.004 --> 51:30.007
Feel free for one fucking moment
of my life.

51:31.508 --> 51:32.759
So why the gun?

51:34.469 --> 51:35.596
For the end.

51:36.346 --> 51:37.890
If the pain is too much.

51:39.474 --> 51:42.728
There's no point,
what you're trying to do, save them.

51:43.437 --> 51:45.563
It's out of your hands.
It was never in your hands.

51:45.564 --> 51:47.356
In my hands. Anyone's hands.

51:47.357 --> 51:49.067
Because of the poison they can pump in?

51:51.028 --> 51:52.820
- You know about that?
- I know about that.

51:52.821 --> 51:54.947
But I don't know who'd do it
and I don't know why.

51:54.948 --> 51:59.369
I know the who, but I don't know why,
and I don't fucking care.

52:00.329 --> 52:05.918
After all I've done, sacrificed
to find out it never really mattered.

52:07.377 --> 52:08.377
They call it

52:08.378 --> 52:11.048
- "the Safeguard Procedure."
- Procedure. I know.

52:11.757 --> 52:13.300
An innocuous little term

52:14.343 --> 52:17.763
that means they can kill us
at any time they want.

52:18.722 --> 52:20.641
No, maybe not.

52:21.892 --> 52:22.892
What do you mean?

52:22.893 --> 52:24.061
Look...

52:28.190 --> 52:29.900
I think I figured something out.

52:35.239 --> 52:37.823
- No. No, no, no. No.
- You can't go in there.

52:37.824 --> 52:39.368
You'll burn to death.

52:39.868 --> 52:41.119
No! No, no!

52:42.871 --> 52:43.830
Get down!

53:33.463 --> 53:35.215
They still got you doing this outside?

53:38.677 --> 53:39.760
You ever get a red?

53:39.761 --> 53:41.013
Not really.

54:06.413 --> 54:08.039
- Hey.
- Hey.

54:08.040 --> 54:09.208
Helen?

54:09.791 --> 54:11.834
Are we gonna do the thing where we pretend

54:11.835 --> 54:14.129
that we don't know
what each other looks like?

54:17.341 --> 54:18.300
I guess not.

54:24.640 --> 54:28.018
So, okay, let's get it out of the way.

54:28.560 --> 54:29.936
Where were you when it happened?

54:29.937 --> 54:32.688
- I was in session--
- Session that day, right?

54:32.689 --> 54:36.193
I was, indeed, yes.
Serving the good people of Georgia's 15th.

54:36.735 --> 54:37.986
And you, where were you?

54:38.695 --> 54:41.073
I've-- At work, at--

54:42.824 --> 54:44.700
Am I supposed to finish that sentence?
I'm not sure.

54:44.701 --> 54:46.160
I-- Is that bad?

54:46.161 --> 54:48.871
It's one-- It's a reporting place.

54:48.872 --> 54:52.083
It's a-- Magazi-- The-- it's <i>The Post</i>.

54:52.084 --> 54:53.835
Oh, God, it's <i>The Post</i>.

54:53.836 --> 54:55.461
Are you still at <i>The Post</i>?

54:55.462 --> 54:58.130
- I--
- Did you really not google me?

54:58.131 --> 54:59.966
Is that so bad?

54:59.967 --> 55:01.051
Wow, okay.

55:02.803 --> 55:06.097
Well, I know that
you are a freshman congressman.

55:06.098 --> 55:09.725
Okay. Well, my age
and flag pin give that away.

55:09.726 --> 55:12.520
Representing, like you said,
the 15th district of Georgia.

55:12.521 --> 55:13.896
Fighting 15th.

55:13.897 --> 55:17.109
And because you can't run anyone
these days unless they served,

55:18.068 --> 55:21.153
after you got a master's in engineering
at the University of Georgia,

55:21.154 --> 55:23.699
you joined the army.

55:24.241 --> 55:25.908
Well, kind of.

55:25.909 --> 55:27.452
Kind of?

55:28.287 --> 55:32.081
Army Corps of Engineers
isn't exactly humping an M-16

55:32.082 --> 55:33.624
through the sandbox.

55:33.625 --> 55:34.877
Thank you.

55:37.629 --> 55:38.838
I better change the subject

55:38.839 --> 55:41.382
before I start bragging
about what we did in New Orleans.

55:41.383 --> 55:45.095
Look at you working that
into conversation so smoothly.

55:48.307 --> 55:51.018
Did you know anyone who was affected?

55:53.812 --> 55:55.272
- By the dirty bomb?
- Yeah.

55:55.772 --> 55:57.232
No. You?

55:58.442 --> 56:01.903
No. My uncle Tyler's been ranting
about Iran for years,

56:01.904 --> 56:03.196
so he took it personally.

56:03.197 --> 56:04.114
But--

56:05.073 --> 56:07.951
my sister's the only one who
lives in D.C. She was away at the time.

56:10.078 --> 56:11.997
Actually, the...

56:13.248 --> 56:16.168
the dirty bomb
is what I wanted to talk to you about.

56:21.381 --> 56:24.634
Starting to feel like I'm the only one
who thought this was a date.

56:24.635 --> 56:25.927
A date?

56:25.928 --> 56:28.262
I know no one uses that term anymore.

56:28.263 --> 56:30.306
If they're 95.

56:30.307 --> 56:32.683
Probably wouldn't have worked out anyway.

56:32.684 --> 56:34.727
Me being a Bulldog. You a Duck.

56:34.728 --> 56:36.270
Did I get that right,

56:36.271 --> 56:39.357
- the University of Oregon?
- I thought you didn't look me up.

56:39.358 --> 56:41.568
Let the record show
I actually dodged the question.

56:45.239 --> 56:46.907
How about I just cut to it?

56:48.450 --> 56:51.453
I'm here because I think
that the people you work for,

56:52.037 --> 56:54.205
and by that I mean the citizens
of this country,

56:54.206 --> 56:58.001
not the shadowy creeps
who pay for campaigns.

56:59.169 --> 57:01.546
I think the people need to know
if there are plans

57:01.547 --> 57:03.173
to strike back against Iran,

57:04.967 --> 57:07.677
whether or not there really was
a radiological weapon attack

57:07.678 --> 57:08.971
on the United States.

57:10.305 --> 57:11.514
How about you?

57:11.515 --> 57:12.599
What do you think?

57:20.941 --> 57:22.276
I think I better go.

57:55.267 --> 57:56.435
Here.

57:59.688 --> 58:01.397
This a gift or...

- It's how I was brought up.
- Something from your home state?

58:05.527 --> 58:07.069
It's not a peach.

58:07.070 --> 58:10.239
Nah, it's just something
I panic bought at the convenience store

58:10.240 --> 58:11.950
around the corner from my apartment.

58:15.829 --> 58:16.830
You take care.

58:29.051 --> 58:30.426
Can I get the check?

58:30.427 --> 58:31.553
Thank you.
