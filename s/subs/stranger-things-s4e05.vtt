We got his digits, man?

26:40.724 --> 26:41.725
[wet plop]

26:41.808 --> 26:44.185
[squelching]

26:45.228 --> 26:47.063
[indistinct chatter in Russian]

26:47.147 --> 26:48.148
[sighs]

26:49.566 --> 26:51.610
[in Russian] Did I tell you
it's okay to break?

26:51.693 --> 26:54.362
Over there, there is a hand.

26:54.446 --> 26:55.572
A HAND!

26:56.281 --> 26:57.532
Are we animals?

26:57.616 --> 26:59.784
-[dramatic musical flourish]
-[metal swishing]

26:59.868 --> 27:01.328
[Antonov] Psst!

27:01.411 --> 27:03.913
Hey, Ivan. Ivan!

27:12.547 --> 27:15.175
-[clanging]
-Stop calling my name.

27:15.258 --> 27:17.552
You trying to get me in trouble?

27:17.636 --> 27:19.929
I don't know what they've told you,

27:20.013 --> 27:21.473
but it is all lies.

27:21.556 --> 27:23.016
I'm here by mistake!

27:23.600 --> 27:25.060
I'm sorry. I cannot help you.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.439
I can make you rich.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.489
See this American?

27:38.406 --> 27:39.616
He comes from money.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.036
Old money.

27:44.537 --> 27:47.957
[in English] Tell him, American.
Tell him how you will make him rich.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.387
You're a real help, American,
you know that?

28:02.263 --> 28:03.640
A real help.

28:06.559 --> 28:07.560
Hey.

28:08.436 --> 28:09.521
[claps hands]

28:09.604 --> 28:12.065
You want to die here?
You want to die? Is that it?

28:12.148 --> 28:14.317
That's what we've been brought here to do.

28:14.401 --> 28:16.528
So, that is it? You give up, then?

28:17.696 --> 28:18.613
[exhales]

28:24.953 --> 28:26.371
What about your woman, huh?

28:27.288 --> 28:29.749
She's captured, yes, but still alive.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.376
We can still save her.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.586
[clicks tongue] "Save her."

28:35.755 --> 28:38.007
That is amusing to you?

28:38.633 --> 28:40.760
You don't get it, do you?
You don't get it.

28:42.095 --> 28:44.764
The closer I get with Joyce,
the more danger she's in.

28:44.848 --> 28:46.057
[melancholy music playing]

28:46.141 --> 28:48.309
You're not thinking straight, American.

28:48.393 --> 28:49.769
No, I think I am.

28:51.312 --> 28:54.399
For the first time in my life,
I think I'm thinking straight.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.946
I used to think I was cursed.

29:01.573 --> 29:02.866
Ever since I was 18.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.035
Got some letter of induction in the mail.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.913
Uncle Sam wants me
to go fight some war in the jungle.

29:09.497 --> 29:14.085
Charlie's moving south like a plague
'cause of commie bastards like you, and…

29:14.878 --> 29:16.629
You know, I'm happy enough to go.

29:17.172 --> 29:20.341
Prove to my old man
I'm not the piece of shit he thinks I am.

29:22.177 --> 29:25.847
I get over there, I must test well,
and they put me in the Chemical Corps.

29:25.930 --> 29:28.516
There I am. I'm just… a kid, you know.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.435
I'm 18 years old, 8,000 miles away,

29:30.518 --> 29:35.482
and I'm mixing up
these… 55-gallon drums of Agent Orange.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.235
With just these kitchen gloves, you know?

29:40.528 --> 29:43.323
We used to clean out
these buffalo turbines after a run

29:43.406 --> 29:45.158
and just be inhaling the stuff.

29:45.241 --> 29:46.576
No masks, nothing.

29:49.954 --> 29:53.958
"It's not chemical warfare.
It's just herbicide to kill plants."

29:55.752 --> 29:58.171
"Harmless." That's what they told us.

30:01.841 --> 30:03.092
Then I got back to real life,

30:03.176 --> 30:05.428
and these guys I worked with,
the ones that made it back,

30:05.512 --> 30:08.348
they started trying
to get back to normal, you know?

30:08.431 --> 30:11.059
Having families.
And then things started going wrong.

30:13.478 --> 30:16.439
Kids born stillborn. Dead in the womb.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.777
Crooked spines, eyes popped out.

30:23.905 --> 30:24.906
The horror…

30:27.450 --> 30:29.327
followed us, clung to us.

30:31.412 --> 30:33.164
My wife Diane, she wanted a baby.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.249
[sighs]

30:34.332 --> 30:35.750
I did too.

30:37.293 --> 30:39.254
We had a baby, and she was, um…

30:40.463 --> 30:41.673
she was born healthy.

30:41.756 --> 30:43.424
She was perfect, you know. Sara.

30:44.968 --> 30:46.177
And then she died.

30:46.261 --> 30:47.887
[woman] Blood pressure's dropping.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.931
[Hopper] It wasn't an easy death. She…

30:51.224 --> 30:52.141
suffered.

30:52.225 --> 30:53.518
[muffled wailing]

30:53.601 --> 30:55.311
I knew the risks, but I, um…

30:57.188 --> 30:58.314
I hid them.

31:00.108 --> 31:03.528
And then Diane left me.
She didn't blame me. Not with words.

31:04.153 --> 31:05.613
After that, I was just…

31:08.616 --> 31:11.077
I just hid myself in drugs and alcohol.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.582
And then people
started coming into my life.

31:17.542 --> 31:22.338
This girl El, and Joyce just happened,
and I told myself they needed me.

31:23.256 --> 31:24.674
But that wasn't true.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.720
That's a lie. They didn't need me.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.307
I needed them.

31:35.602 --> 31:36.686
I needed them.

31:37.770 --> 31:41.274
You were right, what you said last night.
I knew the risks,

31:41.357 --> 31:43.484
breaking out of here, but I did it anyway.

31:45.236 --> 31:48.156
The minute I sent for Joyce,
the minute I sent for her,

31:49.532 --> 31:51.117
I sentenced her to death.

31:52.035 --> 31:53.828
Just like I did with Sara.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.414
[melancholy music continues]

32:00.793 --> 32:02.795
Everyone I love, I hurt.

32:08.760 --> 32:10.762
See, I was wrong this whole time.

32:12.430 --> 32:13.640
I wasn't cursed.

32:17.602 --> 32:18.853
I am the curse.

32:19.395 --> 32:21.606
[distant, shrill snarling]

32:24.108 --> 32:26.110
[snarling continues]

32:26.736 --> 32:28.738
[unsettling, tense music playing]

32:31.908 --> 32:33.910
[snarling continues]

32:35.036 --> 32:36.746
I've heard rumors of a monster.

32:37.747 --> 32:38.915
From America.

32:41.459 --> 32:44.003
I don't know
if what you say is true, American,

32:44.087 --> 32:47.799
if you're truly a cursed man,
but you're right about one thing.

32:48.716 --> 32:50.760
We are going to die in here.

32:50.843 --> 32:52.845
[unsettling music intensifies]

33:13.574 --> 33:14.867
[knocking echoes loudly]

33:15.451 --> 33:16.452
[door hinge creaks]

33:17.954 --> 33:18.871
Can I help you?

33:19.872 --> 33:21.249
We need to look around.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.334
[tense synth music playing]

33:23.418 --> 33:25.461
[door creaking]

33:35.930 --> 33:37.724
[ominous stinger plays]

33:37.807 --> 33:38.766
[Wayne] Yep.

33:39.934 --> 33:41.769
I think it's some kind of leak.

33:43.563 --> 33:46.441
I haven't had a chance to fix it
with everything going on.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.402
Pack your things. We're moving you.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.154
[sighs]

33:51.821 --> 33:53.823
[disquieting synth music builds]

34:01.748 --> 34:03.249
[woman] The devil is here.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.668
I can feel his presence…

34:07.879 --> 34:11.340
growing stronger each day.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.926
But I know Chrissy's in heaven now,

34:15.053 --> 34:16.971
looking down at us, smiling.

34:17.055 --> 34:17.930
[scattered sobbing]

34:18.014 --> 34:20.725
Happy to see all the lives
she touched and brightened.

34:21.768 --> 34:23.770
But I also know she's frustrated.

34:24.979 --> 34:25.980
Angry.

34:26.064 --> 34:29.650
That the monster
that did this to her is still out there.

34:30.234 --> 34:31.319
Still.

34:32.487 --> 34:33.654
Hurting others.

34:34.447 --> 34:37.366
[growing muffled]
How can he live, while my angel is gone?

34:38.242 --> 34:40.161
-I know God has a plan…

[eerie audio distortion]

34:48.836 --> 34:50.546
[sobs] Lord, I've prayed.

34:52.507 --> 34:54.467
And I just do not understand it.

34:54.550 --> 34:55.760
[sobs]

34:55.843 --> 34:57.303
[echoing] I see no reason.

34:58.304 --> 34:59.472
I see no reason.

34:59.555 --> 35:01.808
[Jason] So I finally
got ahold of Cappelletti.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.309
[tense music playing]

35:03.392 --> 35:04.811
Photos for the '86 yearbook.

35:05.603 --> 35:06.437
Hot damn.

35:08.314 --> 35:09.649
[Andy] Sinclair?

35:09.732 --> 35:11.067
Goddamn traitor.

35:11.567 --> 35:13.736
Only reason he'd lead us to a dead end.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.029
The Hellfire Club.

35:15.530 --> 35:18.366
-They're hiding Eddie.
-Maybe we should bring this to the cops.

35:18.449 --> 35:20.576
The cops who think
Chrissy's a drug dealer?

35:20.660 --> 35:22.995
Who are letting this… this psycho
go around killing people?

35:23.079 --> 35:25.873
I'm just saying,
what if this cult is doing shit to us?

35:25.957 --> 35:28.459
-Doing what?
-They already know we're after them.

35:29.627 --> 35:33.047
-What if they cursed us or some shit?
-Patrick thinks he's cursed.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.757
-[all chuckling]
-[Jason] Hey!

35:34.841 --> 35:36.175
None of this is funny.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.138
Look, I don't believe
in that supernatural crap, all right?

35:40.221 --> 35:42.223
But this cult is dangerous.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.891
We have to be smart about this.

35:45.685 --> 35:46.686
I made a list.

35:46.769 --> 35:48.771
Everywhere these freaks have been seen.

35:48.855 --> 35:52.024
We divide and conquer.
Check 'em out one by one. Smoke 'em out.

35:52.108 --> 35:53.943
We should add Reefer Rick's house to this.

35:54.026 --> 35:55.069
What?

35:55.153 --> 35:56.195
Reefer Rick.

35:56.904 --> 35:58.156
He's Eddie's supplier.

35:58.239 --> 36:01.868
He's supposed to be in prison,
but someone spotted him back in his house.

36:02.451 --> 36:04.537
Now my parents are freaking out and shit.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.414
It's probably nothing.

36:06.497 --> 36:07.623
I don't know.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.625
No, that's good. That's good.

36:10.835 --> 36:12.128
No stones unturned.

Yeah, that's not creepy.

36:43.326 --> 36:44.827
-[wood snaps]
-[nail clinks]

36:44.911 --> 36:48.748
What exactly are we supposed to be
looking for in this shithole?

36:48.831 --> 36:49.999
[Nancy] We're not sure.

36:50.082 --> 36:52.460
We just know this house
is important to Vecna.

36:52.543 --> 36:55.379
Because Max saw it
in Vecna's red soup mind world?

36:55.463 --> 36:56.923
-Basically.
-Great.

36:57.006 --> 37:00.301
Maybe it holds a clue to where Vecna is.
Why he's back. Why he killed the Creels.

37:00.384 --> 37:03.346
And how to stop him
before he comes back for Max.

37:03.429 --> 37:05.514
We don't think he's in here,

37:06.599 --> 37:07.642
do we?

37:07.725 --> 37:09.185
Guess we'll find out.

37:09.268 --> 37:10.144
Ready?

37:10.228 --> 37:12.021
-Mm-hmm.
-[tense music playing]

37:13.481 --> 37:14.523

[Vecna] Max.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.906
What are you doing in here,

37:22.740 --> 37:24.033
Max?

37:25.159 --> 37:26.577
[doorknob rattles]

37:26.661 --> 37:27.912
It's locked.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.789
Should I knock, see if anybody's home?

37:29.872 --> 37:30.873
[Robin] No need.

37:34.794 --> 37:35.836
I found a key.

-[door screeches]

37:52.478 --> 37:53.479
[whistles]

38:07.618 --> 38:09.996
[Lucas] Looks like someone
forgot to pay their electric bill.

38:12.581 --> 38:13.958
Where'd everyone get those?

38:16.877 --> 38:18.879
Do you need to be told everything?

38:20.131 --> 38:21.257
You're not a child.

38:21.841 --> 38:22.883
-Thank you.
-Huh.

Back pocket.

38:31.350 --> 38:33.352
[tense music continues]

38:36.772 --> 38:39.358
[Nancy] They just left everything.

38:40.109 --> 38:42.778
I guess a triple homicide
isn't good for resale value.

38:44.947 --> 38:45.906
[Max] Hey, guys?

38:47.283 --> 38:48.826
You all see that, right?

38:49.785 --> 38:51.245
-[Dustin] Yeah.
-[Steve] Yeah.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.042
Is this what you saw?

38:56.667 --> 38:58.210
In your visions?

38:59.420 --> 39:02.173
[chime echoes]

39:02.256 --> 39:04.925
I mean, it's… just a clock.

39:05.593 --> 39:06.427
Right?

39:15.603 --> 39:17.271
Like a normal old clock.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.982
Why is this wizard obsessed with clocks?

39:21.108 --> 39:24.570
Maybe he's, like,
a clockmaker or something?

39:25.780 --> 39:27.656
I think you cracked the case, Steve.

39:28.741 --> 39:29.950
[Nancy] All I know is

39:30.826 --> 39:32.119
the answers are here.

39:33.329 --> 39:34.288
Somewhere.

39:35.956 --> 39:39.001
Okay, everyone stay in groups of two.
Robin, upstairs.

39:41.587 --> 39:42.755
Come on. Let's go.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.885
[Steve sighs heavily]

39:47.968 --> 39:50.221
-Was that a sigh?
-No, I did not sigh.

39:51.138 --> 39:53.724
-Why'd you sigh?
-I didn't sigh. Just come on, dude.

39:54.350 --> 39:56.977
-I heard you.
