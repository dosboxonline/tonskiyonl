01:37.347 --> 01:42.436
Chef Omar. Strangolapreti.
My mother's favorite.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.442
My grandma makes

Why are you doing it like that?

01:59.661 --> 02:02.414
[Sean] Why would you make savory eggnog?

02:02.497 --> 02:05.292
We got sage leaves wilting right here.
What's this?

[contestant 1] Uh, uh-- Cilantro.

02:06.668 --> 02:08.836
-[Sean] Okay, it's watercress.
-Yes, watercress.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.798
[Sean] So, you-- you're coming at me,
it's a watercress-nache? What is it?

02:11.882 --> 02:13.300
-It's, uh-- A corn--
-[Sean] What is this?

02:13.383 --> 02:15.969

02:29.274 --> 02:30.317
[Leanne] How's it going?

02:30.400 --> 02:32.819
Three months ago she didn't want anything
to do with this place.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.029
Now she won't leave.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.950
[guard] Sir, I said no alcohol
on the premises.

02:39.368 --> 02:40.994
-[sighs]
-[guard] You gotta put that away!

02:41.870 --> 02:42.996
I don't like these people.

02:43.080 --> 02:44.665
[Leanne] When do you think
you'll be home?

02:44.748 --> 02:46.041
There's a million forms to sign.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.168
For Sean to sign.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.878
[Leanne] I'm making
Dorothy's favorite cake.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.755
Oh, good. I'm starving.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.341
You'd expect better food at a place
that costs more than Harvard.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.426
-[Leanne] Did you get the flowers?
-Yeah.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.971
They're in the trunk.

-[contestant 2] No, Chef.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.036
[Sean] There's more fucking salt
than there is in this dish.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.497
If you are a quitter
then quit, quit, quit!

04:50.249 --> 04:52.084
[contestant 3] And, uh, truffles.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.920

-No, no, no! What are you doing?
-[audience shouting]

04:59.842 --> 05:01.760
Oh, you are kidding.

05:02.594 --> 05:05.514
What are you gonna do? Serve burned shit?

05:05.597 --> 05:07.057
-No, Chef.
-Would you eat burned shit?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.141
No, Chef.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.677
Leanne, are you okay?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.095
You left your posts.

07:08.178 --> 07:10.556
Police cleared the park.
They shoved us into vans.

07:10.639 --> 07:13.642
It happened fast.
A neighbor must've called in a complaint.

07:13.725 --> 07:16.603
No. This was the church.
Don't you understand?

07:16.687 --> 07:19.231
They're closing in on me.
I found one in the house.

so she'll get better.

22:35.898 --> 22:37.774
We just have to be there for her, right?

22:39.234 --> 22:42.070
[sighs] Best of luck with that.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.993
[Dorothy] Just maybe a cup of tea.

22:48.952 --> 22:50.120
[Leanne] How is she?

22:52.039 --> 22:53.207
Resting.

22:53.290 --> 22:55.042
I should go see if she needs anything.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.668
I don't think that's a good idea.

22:57.461 --> 22:58.420
Why?

22:58.504 --> 23:01.423
Because she needs space from all of us.

23:03.634 --> 23:05.177
[Dorothy] Shut the door.

23:08.430 --> 23:09.723
Good night, Leanne.

23:27.908 --> 23:31.245
[rumbling, cracking]
