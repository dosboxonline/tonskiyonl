04:23.931 --> 04:26.641
You hear about that
clusterfuck up on North Pine?

04:26.642 --> 04:28.392
Dutch Stevens' kid.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.604
How the fuck do you flip
a two-ton snow plow?

04:31.605 --> 04:33.023
With stupidity.

04:33.899 --> 04:35.776
The apple don't fall far from the gutter.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.402
Well, that's kind of you.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.571
On the house.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.448
Thank you.

04:44.785 --> 04:45.869
Hey, Rose.

04:46.411 --> 04:47.788
You want a refill?

04:50.374 --> 04:52.668
You can top me off anytime.

04:54.461 --> 04:55.838
I like the new do.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.423
<i>Tr√®s chic.</i>

06:04.823 --> 06:07.075
Harmony Cobel.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.455
Well, flip my toboggan.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.380
You want coffee?

06:22.049 --> 06:23.091
No.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.222
Tables are for paying customers.

06:30.474 --> 06:32.351
Fine. Then buy me a coffee.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.321
The town is older than I remember.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.204
Frailer.

06:55.958 --> 06:58.835
Yeah, well, with the market readjustment
from a few years ago

06:58.836 --> 07:00.461
and the fluctuating interest rates,

07:00.462 --> 07:04.550
there was a retrenchment from some
of the core infrastructure investments.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.769
I need a favor.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.398
But not here.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.944
Meet me at the factory.

07:43.463 --> 07:46.216
- Hey, Dot. Close up for me.
- Sure.

09:57.973 --> 10:00.976
You know how fucked it is
to ask me to come here?

10:03.770 --> 10:06.273
I need you to drive me to Sissy's.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.698
No, thanks.

10:18.577 --> 10:22.164
If they're watching the house,
they'll recognize my car.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.085
How much trouble are you in?

10:31.089 --> 10:32.299
Enough.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.311
You know she still lives by the nine?

10:47.105 --> 10:48.273
I assumed.

10:49.566 --> 10:52.486
Then you know she's a fucking pariah here.

10:53.904 --> 10:56.782
You can stay in the truck.

10:59.952 --> 11:02.287
I need to get something.

11:04.915 --> 11:07.084
Why would I help you with anything?

11:13.131 --> 11:15.509
We were once chums.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.682
Old colleagues lift each other up.

11:23.809 --> 11:25.143
Colleagues?

11:29.940 --> 11:31.608
Child fucking labor.

11:37.990 --> 11:44.204
Kier and Imogene met at the Ether Mill,

11:45.163 --> 11:46.707
you know that?

11:47.749 --> 11:50.252
Was she hacking up a lung at the time?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.087
I can smell it on your breath.

11:53.088 --> 11:54.964
Pathetic.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.924
Fuck you.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.261
You can help me or not.

12:00.012 --> 12:04.850
But I'll not be the punching dummy
for your resentments.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.119
Coast is clear.

13:56.044 --> 13:58.172
You're higher than a bearded vulture.

14:05.053 --> 14:07.097
Tell her to drop dead for me.

14:18.233 --> 14:19.693
You are not welcome here.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.449
This is trespass.

14:26.950 --> 14:29.328
I have a mind to call the authorities.

14:31.330 --> 14:34.791
I do not want that huff peddler
on my property.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.336
You gave him his thirst for it.

14:38.337 --> 14:40.255
You've a liar's mouth.

14:58.440 --> 15:02.319
Do you want to come down here
and tell me what this is all about?

15:14.957 --> 15:16.875
What have you done with my things?

15:18.794 --> 15:21.004
Sold. To the poor.

15:21.547 --> 15:23.882
They weren't yours to sell.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.217
I sit in this house.

15:26.218 --> 15:27.302
You do not.

15:29.555 --> 15:31.014
Has anyone been here?

15:32.850 --> 15:34.059
No one comes here.

15:36.270 --> 15:37.938
Or telephoned?

15:43.277 --> 15:44.862
A Mr. Drummond.

15:47.322 --> 15:48.824
And what did he want?

15:54.037 --> 15:57.749
What have you done, little mouse?

16:01.461 --> 16:02.629
Harmony!

16:03.297 --> 16:05.089
I want the key to Mother's room.

16:05.090 --> 16:09.552
That room stays shut
until all who remember her sit with Kier.

16:09.553 --> 16:10.762
You know this.

16:11.346 --> 16:12.598
Give me the key.

16:14.183 --> 16:16.727
Why do you bring nothing but woe
into my life?

16:18.228 --> 16:21.190
No, it is you who cursed this house
with woe.

16:22.983 --> 16:24.735
I will not have this quarrel.

16:28.447 --> 16:30.365
What were her last words?

16:31.533 --> 16:35.204
Child, do not test me.

16:35.746 --> 16:37.497
What were they?

16:41.043 --> 16:46.256
She said nothing after you pulled the tube
from her gullet.

17:01.396 --> 17:06.777
There was gratitude in her eyes
to be freed from her suffering.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.449
If only she had been a believer.

17:14.201 --> 17:17.119
Perhaps she would have found solace
in the nine.

17:33.011 --> 17:37.891
You didn't have to listen to her wheezing
as I did, day after day.

17:44.523 --> 17:49.653
I would have cared for her myself,
had I not been at school.

17:51.655 --> 17:53.031
Where you belonged.

17:57.452 --> 18:00.873
I didn't even get to say goodbye.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.917
Your studies were more important.

18:04.835 --> 18:07.629
Mr. Eagan saw Kier in you.

18:08.547 --> 18:09.882
He really did.

18:11.884 --> 18:13.760
And the Wintertide Fellowship--

18:14.303 --> 18:18.974
Even at the factory, no apprentice
was more industrious than you.

18:23.896 --> 18:26.356
Such a disappointment you've proven to be.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.033
What did Drummond tell you?

18:39.036 --> 18:42.455
Return and plead forgiveness, child.

18:42.456 --> 18:44.249
The Eagans will grant it.

18:47.377 --> 18:48.879
And show me mercy,

18:49.963 --> 18:51.757
just like you did with Mother.

19:00.432 --> 19:01.600
Where is the key?

19:15.489 --> 19:17.991
All you will find in there is pain.

19:52.609 --> 19:53.902
Where is it?

20:11.545 --> 20:13.172
I found it!

20:22.097 --> 20:23.098
Come on.

24:06.655 --> 24:07.780
Don't! Stand away!

24:07.781 --> 24:09.365
Get your harpy hands off me.

24:09.366 --> 24:13.202
You've no salutation here,
you blighted snuff slave.

24:13.203 --> 24:15.246
All right, I missed you too.
You smell like crow skin.

24:15.247 --> 24:16.914
I'll phone somebody. I swear it!

24:16.915 --> 24:19.542
Yeah, call everyone.
We'll have a fucking kegger.

24:19.543 --> 24:20.793
This is a pure house.

24:20.794 --> 24:23.463
Back off or I'll put you in the bay!

24:28.719 --> 24:30.261
What is it? What happened?

24:30.262 --> 24:32.430
Nothing. Came to get you.

24:32.431 --> 24:34.057
She's not too happy about it.

24:35.309 --> 24:36.976
Did you see something?

24:36.977 --> 24:40.147
No, but it's cold as shit in the truck,
and I gotta get back.

24:42.191 --> 24:44.609
I have to find it.

24:44.610 --> 24:45.944
Find what?

24:47.487 --> 24:50.824
Just give me a minute just to think.

25:10.802 --> 25:11.970
I liked her.

25:20.729 --> 25:22.898
You barely knew her.

25:25.025 --> 25:26.984
She hated Lumon more than I did.

25:26.985 --> 25:28.904
That's all I needed to know.

25:34.076 --> 25:36.662
At least she doesn't have to live
with Sissy anymore.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.237
You wanna get high?

27:26.772 --> 27:27.898
Wow.

27:33.737 --> 27:38.033
I haven't done that since I was eight.

27:41.828 --> 27:44.164
You ready to man the vat for ten hours?

27:55.175 --> 28:00.430
It's so shameful that you sell it.

28:40.512 --> 28:42.264
I don't think it's here.

28:45.142 --> 28:46.685
What you're looking for.

28:55.110 --> 28:56.111
Get out of here!

29:02.743 --> 29:04.828
She wouldn't throw it away.

31:13.373 --> 31:14.291
Find it?

31:15.709 --> 31:18.879
Get the truck ready. And watch my head.

31:28.805 --> 31:31.724
I'm going. Don't tell them I was here.

31:31.725 --> 31:35.270
I would never bear falsity
to a steward of the Eagans.

31:37.606 --> 31:41.276
Lumon destroyed this town.

31:41.902 --> 31:43.654
You owe them no loyalty.

31:44.988 --> 31:47.366
There was no town before the factory.

31:49.493 --> 31:51.662
And what about your own employ?

31:52.162 --> 31:57.376
Everything that you have,
you owe back to the Eagans as fealty.

32:00.254 --> 32:01.547
Fealty?

32:08.387 --> 32:09.471
Mine!

32:10.389 --> 32:12.808
My designs!

32:13.392 --> 32:14.768
Circuit blueprint...

32:15.394 --> 32:16.937
Base code...

32:17.521 --> 32:18.980
Overtime contingency...

32:18.981 --> 32:20.941
Glasgow block. All of it.

32:22.818 --> 32:24.987
Jame Eagan was the inventor.

32:25.779 --> 32:27.322
So I've heard.

32:44.298 --> 32:45.591
Extraordinary.

32:48.677 --> 32:51.221
Why have you never spoken of this?

32:52.389 --> 32:56.518
It was told Kier's knowledge is for all.

32:57.686 --> 32:58.854
That is true.

33:00.898 --> 33:06.069
That if I sought credit,
I would be banished.

33:20.501 --> 33:23.670
I hope you die as painfully as she did.

33:26.256 --> 33:29.051
It was her hand that removed the tube,
not mine.

33:30.385 --> 33:31.386
No!

33:32.679 --> 33:34.723
Your mother was a coward.

33:35.557 --> 33:38.769
More sick in the soul than in the body.

33:39.686 --> 33:42.648
Filled with malice and resentment.

33:46.944 --> 33:48.654
I don't believe you!

33:50.572 --> 33:52.115
I thought you were different...

33:54.368 --> 33:55.911
my flower.

33:56.745 --> 33:59.331
I tried to help you grow.

33:59.998 --> 34:06.672
But now I see you are a weed,
just as she was.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.342
Hey! Someone's comin'!

34:26.775 --> 34:28.318
You better get going.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.076
Hampton.

34:36.702 --> 34:37.828
I'll see you around.

34:56.929 --> 35:00.184
Come and tame these tempers, assholes.

35:11.862 --> 35:14.697
<i>Mrs. Selvig? Thank fuck,
I've been trying to reach you.</i>

35:14.698 --> 35:16.992
Yes, I'm aware.

35:17.784 --> 35:19.953
<i>So, listen, Mark has been reintegrating.</i>

35:20.454 --> 35:21.747
Reghabi?

35:22.372 --> 35:23.456
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:23.457 --> 35:25.625
And she hasn't killed him yet?

35:25.626 --> 35:27.960
<i>No. I mean, I think he's okay?</i>

35:27.961 --> 35:29.962
<i>But listen, we wanna try something else.</i>

35:29.963 --> 35:32.089
Is Mark with you?

35:32.090 --> 35:34.718
- <i>Uh-huh. Yes.</i>
- Put him on.

35:37.095 --> 35:39.139
<i>Yeah. Hello?</i>

35:40.390 --> 35:43.393
Tell me everything.
