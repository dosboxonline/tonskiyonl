10:20.103 --> 10:20.935
[Bart]
Leave it alone!

10:21.029 --> 10:22.120
That's my brain!

10:22.347 --> 10:23.270
After we blow it up,

10:23.365 --> 10:24.939
you can have the biggest chunk.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.349
This isn't some frog

10:26.368 --> 10:28.627
where you can put a firecracker
in its butt.

10:28.854 --> 10:30.111
It's a living thing,

10:30.130 --> 10:32.188
and it's my job
to take care of it

10:32.207 --> 10:34.540
and teach it to do
cool stuff like, um,

10:34.635 --> 10:37.969
paintball and-and
pooping in jack-o'-lanterns.

10:38.121 --> 10:40.472
So hands off my brain!

10:40.699 --> 10:41.973
Okay, okay.

10:42.125 --> 10:44.809
You can have
your stupid head cheese.

10:44.961 --> 10:47.062
Don't worry.
I'm taking you home.

10:48.131 --> 10:51.224
I wonder if
anyone will ever love me

10:51.376 --> 10:54.060
the way he loves that brain.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.303
Look, man, I'm gonna
take better care of you.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.972
You're the only brain I've got.

10:58.066 --> 10:59.473
You need a name, bud.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.142
Wait. Buddy.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.403
Perfect! 'Cause you're my buddy.

11:03.555 --> 11:07.165
Also I don't want to think
about this any harder.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.411
[Bart]
<i> Thursday, May 14th.</i>

11:11.505 --> 11:13.988
<i> Buddy and I had</i>
<i> quite the adventure tonight.</i>

11:14.007 --> 11:16.883
<i> I realized he's more than</i>
<i> just some dumb prank</i>

11:16.993 --> 11:18.568
<i> or a homework assignment.</i>

11:18.661 --> 11:21.012
<i> He's a badass like me.</i>

11:24.092 --> 11:25.517
-[fingers snap]
-Garçon!

11:25.668 --> 11:28.019
Another high chair
for my associate here.

11:30.357 --> 11:33.340
[groans]
You brought your jar friend.

11:33.418 --> 11:35.527
Oh, I get it.
Buddy's a little different.

11:35.678 --> 11:37.195
But he's my responsibility.

11:37.346 --> 11:39.030
Plus he's pretty cool.

11:39.257 --> 11:42.850
Well, uh, maybe he can be
under the table.

11:42.869 --> 11:45.094
Whoa! Buddy's my plus-one.

11:45.096 --> 11:47.205
Would you rather me
bring Milhouse?

11:47.356 --> 11:50.266
No, no, no, no, no.
No one said Milhouse.

11:50.285 --> 11:51.876
Simpsons, a-welcome.

11:52.028 --> 11:54.287
Oh, my favorite a-family.

11:54.381 --> 11:56.606
A-Homer, a-Marge, a-Lisa,

11:56.699 --> 11:59.366
a-Maggie, a-Bart, a-brain.

11:59.535 --> 12:00.701
A-brain?!

12:00.795 --> 12:04.205
[praying in Latin]

12:04.224 --> 12:05.873
It's okay, it's okay.

12:05.967 --> 12:07.541
It's just a school project.

12:07.635 --> 12:10.211
Good a-news.
A table, she just open up

12:10.305 --> 12:12.046
in a-private dining room.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.624
[winded]
You can... go into...

12:14.642 --> 12:16.276
[panting]

12:18.129 --> 12:19.571
My pasta's cold.

12:19.722 --> 12:21.448
Everything's cold!

12:23.726 --> 12:27.061
Ugh, this brain business
will not be good for Bart

12:27.080 --> 12:28.638
if he keeps it up.

12:28.731 --> 12:31.732
Oh, come on, think of all the
worse stuff he could be doing.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.326
Or all the worse stuff
he's done.

12:33.478 --> 12:34.568
He named it!

12:34.662 --> 12:37.255
And I think he gave it
a bite of tiramisu.

12:37.406 --> 12:39.907
[sighs]
This is different for Bart.

12:40.001 --> 12:43.319
What if he becomes
the town weirdo?

12:43.412 --> 12:45.171
Oh, weirdos aren't
what they used to be.

12:45.323 --> 12:48.841
They start computer companies
or own the Las Vegas Raiders.

12:48.994 --> 12:50.584
Or become serial killers.

12:50.678 --> 12:53.997
But still, his odds are
at least two out of three.

12:54.090 --> 12:55.607
Children label each other.

12:55.834 --> 12:59.593
Bart's in danger of becoming
"The Brain Boy."

12:59.687 --> 13:00.928
You worry too much.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.930
Remember when you thought
Lisa was going to hell

13:02.949 --> 13:04.841
because she was a vegetarian?

13:04.934 --> 13:06.342
I still think that.

13:06.361 --> 13:09.120
Excellent work
on your egg projects, class.

13:09.347 --> 13:12.698
And your parenting journals
were really inspired.

13:12.851 --> 13:14.867
An A-plus? I can't believe it.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.352
I've never gotten one of those.

13:16.371 --> 13:19.188
I thought those were just
for suck-wads like Martin.

13:19.282 --> 13:21.800
Okay, everybody,
you did a great job,

13:21.951 --> 13:24.377
so it's time
to turn in your eggs.

13:24.529 --> 13:26.971
Whoa, hold on there.
I am not giving you Buddy.

13:27.198 --> 13:29.456
Well, one of the hardest parts
of parenting

13:29.534 --> 13:31.717
is watching your child move on.

13:31.870 --> 13:33.627
To be Willy's breakfast.

13:33.721 --> 13:36.039
[laughing]

13:36.057 --> 13:37.723
Your brain can have a home

13:37.892 --> 13:39.892
on a shelf
in the school science lab.

13:40.045 --> 13:42.211
[grunts] Buddy hates science.

13:42.230 --> 13:44.355
He's like me.
He's into MeatCanyon videos

13:44.507 --> 13:45.824
and doing wrestling moves
on the dog

13:45.975 --> 13:47.717
and pouring Red Bull
on pancakes!

13:47.810 --> 13:49.977
Bart, it might be healthy
for you

13:49.996 --> 13:52.163
to take a break from Buddy.

13:52.315 --> 13:53.998
And it might be healthy for you
to have your own kid

13:54.225 --> 13:55.575
and not live through us!

13:56.578 --> 14:00.913
I never should've told you
that we were trying!

14:01.007 --> 14:03.490
Don't you worry. It'll work out.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.969
It's only been three months.
Give it time.

14:10.666 --> 14:11.924
Ah, wifeless shopping,

14:12.018 --> 14:14.168
where all the meat is nuggets

14:14.187 --> 14:16.855
and the produce section
doesn't exist.

14:17.006 --> 14:18.189
Ooh, the candy aisle.

14:18.341 --> 14:20.249
Formerly known as cereal.

14:20.251 --> 14:22.402
[humming happily]

14:24.272 --> 14:26.698
I don't care if he is
Milhouse's best friend.

14:26.849 --> 14:28.515
He's just weird.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.018
And not the kind
with "a diagnosis"

14:31.112 --> 14:32.537
that we have to like now.

14:32.764 --> 14:35.264
My JJ says that he talks
to the brain

14:35.358 --> 14:36.857
when no one's looking.

14:36.935 --> 14:38.284
My little Seymour says the kids

14:38.436 --> 14:41.604
all call him "Brain Boy"
behind his back.

14:41.623 --> 14:44.941
Hmm. I wonder
who they're talking about.

14:45.034 --> 14:46.033
Moleman?

14:46.127 --> 14:47.610
Well, whatever
they're calling him,

14:47.629 --> 14:50.430
I don't want Bart Simpson
around my son.

14:54.594 --> 14:58.304
No surprise to me that Bart
Simpson has become a weirdo.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.473
[whispering]
When I had him in second grade,

15:00.567 --> 15:02.049
he ate a booger.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.068
I hear Bart shares his bed
with that brain.

15:04.295 --> 15:05.904
Puts a little sleep mask on it.

15:06.055 --> 15:07.554
It's my fault, girls.

15:07.574 --> 15:11.075
I should've noogied him more,
knuckled some sense into him.

15:11.302 --> 15:15.805
He had potential, but I guess
he's just the town freak now.

15:15.823 --> 15:17.490
[sadly]
Haw-haw.

15:17.642 --> 15:19.584
[humming a tune]

15:22.923 --> 15:25.072
[panting] Marge, you were right.

15:25.166 --> 15:27.741
Everyone in the store
is calling Bart "Brain Boy."

15:27.761 --> 15:29.502
It's already started
with the yentas.

15:29.578 --> 15:32.263
It won't be long before
it spreads to the slaggards!

15:32.340 --> 15:34.098
That's the whole rest
of the town!

15:34.325 --> 15:35.416
Bart is lost.

15:35.660 --> 15:38.102
He won't be known by his name
but by his thing.

15:38.329 --> 15:40.997
Like Comic Book Guy
or Crazy Cat Lady

15:41.090 --> 15:43.499
or Professor Pocket Pool.

15:43.592 --> 15:46.093
Mmm. Mmm.

15:46.187 --> 15:48.171
At least that professor
has lifetime tenure.

15:48.189 --> 15:50.264
Bart's gonna be unemployable.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.766
Mom, Dad, I think
I have a suggestion.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.510
[screams]
Little Miss Know-It-All!

15:54.603 --> 15:56.862
I watched
this nature documentary

15:56.957 --> 15:58.605
that may apply to us.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.774
When a chimp
starts acting strangely,

16:00.868 --> 16:02.868
if it doesn't stop the behavior,

16:02.963 --> 16:05.129
the tribe will
savagely attack it,

16:05.356 --> 16:08.299
leaving it scarred
and isolated forever.

16:08.451 --> 16:09.467
I knew it.

16:09.618 --> 16:12.136
We need to protect
my special little chimp

16:12.363 --> 16:15.865
from the cruel people
in this town who would shun him.

16:15.883 --> 16:21.312
Yes, we must be the loving
parents who keep him locked up.

16:22.390 --> 16:24.816
[Marge hushed]
Open the door quietly.

16:24.967 --> 16:26.709
[whispering]
You know how squeaky it is.

16:26.802 --> 16:28.211
I told you to oil it.

16:28.229 --> 16:29.803
I'm not an architect.

16:29.897 --> 16:32.064
Your stage whispers
are too loud.

16:32.217 --> 16:33.807
Where are you guys going?

16:33.901 --> 16:35.994
Bart! We, um...

16:36.221 --> 16:37.737
We're going to church.

16:37.889 --> 16:39.163
Why didn't you wake me up?

16:39.315 --> 16:40.740
Uh, you hate church.

16:40.834 --> 16:44.577
The itchy pants, the big book
of stuff that never happened.

16:44.729 --> 16:47.338
We thought maybe you'd like
to skip it this week.

16:47.565 --> 16:48.655
As a reward.

16:48.733 --> 16:50.900
Uh, for being so normal.

16:50.918 --> 16:51.901
[Homer chuckles nervously]

16:51.919 --> 16:53.327
This is about Buddy, isn't it?

16:53.346 --> 16:55.329
You're ashamed
to be seen with me.

16:55.406 --> 16:57.015
-Of course not.
-No!

16:57.242 --> 17:00.685
Why would we be ashamed
of our son and his BFF,

17:00.912 --> 17:03.095
a jar of human remains?

17:03.248 --> 17:05.081
Look, sweetie,
why don't you just

17:05.099 --> 17:07.616
make yourself
some Red Bull pancakes,

17:07.618 --> 17:08.918
put on cartoons,

17:08.936 --> 17:11.103
and we'll be back
before you know it.

17:11.256 --> 17:12.438
Go. Go, go, go, go.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.573
[door closes]

17:16.611 --> 17:19.370
"...two oxen, five he-goats,

17:19.522 --> 17:22.874
"five lambs
of the first year, this..."

17:23.101 --> 17:24.450
[quietly]
It's so boring.

17:24.544 --> 17:27.903
But finally some peace
away from Brain Boy.

17:27.905 --> 17:30.197
I hate to say this,
but you're right.

17:30.216 --> 17:33.776
My jaw is unclenched
for the first time in weeks.

17:33.869 --> 17:36.870
[sighing heavily]

17:36.890 --> 17:38.464
[Bart]
Sorry I'm late, everyone!

17:38.616 --> 17:40.132
-Good to see ya.
-[congregation gasps]

17:40.209 --> 17:43.619
Don't mind us. Just gonna sit
with my loving family.

17:43.638 --> 17:45.121
That's the Brain Boy.

17:45.139 --> 17:48.140
It's so gross and wrinkled.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.976
Don't look at him, JJ.

17:51.053 --> 17:53.237
Bart is troubled. Mmm.

17:53.389 --> 17:55.556
So, what episode of Jesus
are we on today?

17:55.575 --> 17:57.817
Is he still talking about
not judging people?

17:57.969 --> 17:59.243
You know, loving your brother?

17:59.470 --> 18:01.579
-Or your son?
-[congregation groaning]

18:01.806 --> 18:03.581
Ugh, Bart, stop it!

18:03.732 --> 18:04.898
This is enough!

18:04.918 --> 18:06.417
Yeah, this isn't just
some little quirk

18:06.527 --> 18:09.145
like wearing a fedora
or being a Libertarian.

18:09.163 --> 18:11.330
You got a disgusting brain
in a greasy jar.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.924
[scoffs] My family.

18:13.075 --> 18:15.909
You're the ones who always said
you'd love me no matter what.

18:15.929 --> 18:17.261
Unconditionally!

18:17.413 --> 18:20.306
This was
an unforeseen condition!

18:22.268 --> 18:25.586
[gasps] Oh, wait.
I didn't mean that.

18:25.605 --> 18:26.829
Too late, Mom.

18:26.922 --> 18:29.107
Yes, I have a brain in a jar.
So what?

18:29.258 --> 18:30.942
Sideshow Mel has
a human bone in his hair

18:31.093 --> 18:32.926
and nobody talks about that.

18:33.004 --> 18:35.855
For your information, weirdo,

18:36.007 --> 18:39.342
this is the femur of a kangaroo!

18:39.435 --> 18:43.012
It was given to me
by Yahoo Serious!

18:43.030 --> 18:44.864
Go ahead, laugh and point at me.

18:45.016 --> 18:47.350
Call me Brain Boy. I don't care.

18:47.368 --> 18:49.352
I have a friend
who will never judge me,

18:49.445 --> 18:51.203
who's always been there for me:

18:51.356 --> 18:52.446
this brain!

18:52.465 --> 18:54.948
He gets me,
'cause we're one in the same:

18:55.042 --> 18:57.618
badasses who don't play
by society's rules.

18:57.712 --> 18:58.970
We're the Bartmen.

18:59.197 --> 19:01.389
Me and my best pal!

19:02.625 --> 19:04.809
Corbin Everly?

19:04.960 --> 19:06.811
Who's Corbin Everly?

19:06.962 --> 19:08.295
Hold on.

19:08.464 --> 19:10.723
He was a local tax accountant

19:10.817 --> 19:12.650
who donated his body to science

19:12.801 --> 19:16.154
hoping it could benefit
the world after his passing.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.215
So Buddy's nothing like me?

19:19.308 --> 19:21.159
He's not some rude, crude,
prankin' dude

19:21.386 --> 19:23.143
with the freaky fresh 'tude?

19:23.163 --> 19:26.555
He was just some guy
named Corbin?

19:26.574 --> 19:30.559
Oh, maybe I shouldn't have been
sloshing him all over town.

19:30.578 --> 19:33.562
Mm. I feel bad for Bart.

19:33.581 --> 19:37.341
No boy wants his brain
to turn out to be a nerd.

19:37.493 --> 19:40.586
Mom, I don't think I want to be
the Brain Boy anymore.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.905
Oh, sweetie.

19:42.924 --> 19:48.019
I'm sorry we weren't more
supportive during this phase.

19:48.095 --> 19:50.855
