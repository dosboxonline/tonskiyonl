00:01.833 --> 00:04.416
<i>When have we ever followed orders?</i>

00:11.666 --> 00:14.416
<i>We've stayed
off the Empire's radar since Kamino.</i>

00:14.958 --> 00:17.375
<i>I'd like to keep it that way.</i>

00:17.375 --> 00:20.916
Pull off this heist,
and you can buy your freedom.

00:20.916 --> 00:22.583
We're already free.

00:23.208 --> 00:24.958
<i>It's cute you think that.</i>

00:24.958 --> 00:28.041
More and more of our brothers are
waking up to what's been done to them.

00:29.333 --> 00:31.208
We should be doing more.

00:32.375 --> 00:36.208
The progress we are making
in the field of cloning is

00:36.208 --> 00:38.083
of great importance to the Emperor.

00:38.083 --> 00:42.458
We shall usher in a new era.

00:43.458 --> 00:46.541
<i>We make our own decisions.
Our own choices.</i>

00:47.125 --> 00:49.541
And we have to live with them too.

00:50.500 --> 00:51.916
Help him!

00:51.916 --> 00:56.291
He is expendable, as are you.

00:56.291 --> 00:57.875
Lieutenant.

01:02.041 --> 01:06.500
Your former squad,
they're in possession of something I need.

01:07.125 --> 01:08.666
The kid.

01:13.291 --> 01:16.333
Plan 88. They're after Omega.

01:17.333 --> 01:19.458
I found a recent distress message sent

01:19.458 --> 01:21.333
from Crosshair's old code.

01:21.333 --> 01:23.833
<i>Crosshair turned on the Empire?</i>

01:23.833 --> 01:26.500
If there's a chance to get him back,
we have to take it.

01:28.541 --> 01:31.875
Sacrifices have to be made
for the greater good.

01:38.208 --> 01:41.208
When have we ever followed orders?

01:42.291 --> 01:44.083
No!

01:44.083 --> 01:45.125
Tech!

01:47.208 --> 01:48.625
The Empire's here.

01:48.625 --> 01:50.416
What did you do?

01:51.583 --> 01:53.750
I did not come here for them, Omega.

01:53.750 --> 01:56.083
I came to return you to Nala Se.

02:01.541 --> 02:02.791
Why did they bring me here?

02:05.666 --> 02:08.500
We are going to get her back.

02:08.500 --> 02:12.875
And we don't stop searching until we do.

03:07.041 --> 03:09.875
Shuttle 135 to Tantiss base. Do you copy?

03:13.166 --> 03:14.875
Affirmative, 135.

03:14.875 --> 03:16.041
What is your status?

03:16.041 --> 03:19.458
<i>On final approach,
but visibility is limited.</i>

03:19.458 --> 03:20.791
You're cleared for landing.

03:20.791 --> 03:22.041
Stay on course.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.958
Whoa!

03:29.958 --> 03:31.166
Mayday! Mayday!

03:31.166 --> 03:33.291
Our systems are unresponsive. Do you copy?

03:35.083 --> 03:36.583
I can't restore power.

03:36.583 --> 03:37.666
We're going down!

04:04.125 --> 04:06.458
TK-343 to base. Do you copy?

04:07.041 --> 04:10.000
We have to get moving.
There are creatures in this jungle.

04:10.666 --> 04:12.875
Relax. The lurca hounds keep them at bay.

04:12.875 --> 04:14.708
Not this far out.

04:14.708 --> 04:16.500
We need to--

04:23.250 --> 04:25.541
<i>TK-343 to base. Send backup!</i>

04:25.541 --> 04:27.291
<i>What's that?</i>

04:27.291 --> 04:29.250
Why hasn't the shuttle arrived yet?

04:29.750 --> 04:31.875
Sir, the vessel crashed in sector four.

04:32.375 --> 04:33.583
Should I send a recovery team?

04:36.625 --> 04:38.708
- Negative.
- <i>Over there!</i>

04:39.625 --> 04:42.666
If they're past the perimeter,
then they're as good as dead.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.541
Good morning, Omega.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.375
How are you feeling today?

05:35.375 --> 05:36.708
Like a prisoner.

05:37.500 --> 05:38.500
I want to leave.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.958
Prisoner? Omega, you are no such thing.

05:42.708 --> 05:46.250
It will take time to adjust,
but you will acclimate.

05:46.250 --> 05:49.583
It is far safer in here than out there.

05:50.375 --> 05:51.375
Come.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.125
We have much to do.

06:57.041 --> 06:59.333
And now,
I need to take a blood sample from you.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.375
From me?

07:01.375 --> 07:02.791
Why?

07:02.791 --> 07:05.458
The samples are used
for various research projects.

07:05.458 --> 07:08.000
All of us serve a purpose here.

07:08.875 --> 07:09.875
It won't hurt.

07:15.083 --> 07:17.500
Can you at least tell me
where my brothers are?

07:21.208 --> 07:22.208
I do not know.

07:26.541 --> 07:32.666
If you're a clone like me,
how come I never saw you on Kamino?

07:32.666 --> 07:37.416
Because I was sent elsewhere
until Dr. Hemlock took me under his wing.

07:37.416 --> 07:41.375
He saw potential in me,
like Nala Se sees in you.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.166
I never knew that I had a sister.

07:45.458 --> 07:46.750
It's nice not being alone.

07:56.125 --> 07:57.208
Head to the lab.

07:57.750 --> 07:59.500
Nala Se is expecting these.

09:10.291 --> 09:12.625
Thank you, Omega.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.916
Omega, your sample was taken?

09:30.916 --> 09:33.333
Mm-hmm. Emerie said it was routine.

09:46.666 --> 09:49.083
Why are you discarding it?

09:49.958 --> 09:51.250
Tell no one.

09:51.833 --> 09:53.625
It is safer this way.

09:55.291 --> 09:56.541
This research,

09:57.583 --> 10:00.416
it's not like what we did on Kamino,
is it?

10:01.041 --> 10:03.958
No, it is not.

10:06.833 --> 10:08.375
I don't understand.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.166
Why did they bring me here?

10:11.833 --> 10:14.125
To ensure that I cooperate.

10:15.791 --> 10:20.583
The Empire seeks the reproduction
of a genetic M-count,

10:21.125 --> 10:26.875
but the experiments on the specimens
have yet to yield the desired result.

10:28.625 --> 10:29.750
What specimens?

10:30.833 --> 10:32.125
You mean the clones?

10:33.208 --> 10:35.750
No. Not the clones.

10:36.833 --> 10:41.458
How nice to see you reunited
with your trusted assistant.

10:41.458 --> 10:46.375
I'm sure Omega's presence here
will only strengthen your efforts.

10:47.458 --> 10:48.916
Shall we head to the vault?

10:52.125 --> 10:54.916
See to your remaining tasks.

13:05.541 --> 13:06.625
Hi, Batcher.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.708
Hmm. Still won't eat the food, huh?

13:13.208 --> 13:14.250
I don't blame you.

13:17.041 --> 13:19.541
Here. I saved you some of mine.

13:38.458 --> 13:39.666
Better?

13:45.041 --> 13:46.333
I'll bring you more tomorrow.

14:30.000 --> 14:31.083
Crosshair.

14:31.708 --> 14:35.375
I tried to come earlier, but there were
too many guards watching me.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.583
You shouldn't be down here at all.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.541
Well,
how else are we gonna plan an escape?

14:43.541 --> 14:45.833
There is no "we."

14:45.833 --> 14:47.666
And there is no escape.

14:48.333 --> 14:49.875
I've already tried.

14:50.875 --> 14:53.000
Every stronghold has a weak point.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.958
Maybe I can convince Emerie to help.
She's one of us.

14:56.958 --> 15:00.041
Not every clone is your ally.

15:00.958 --> 15:02.791
You trust too easily.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.458
Maybe you don't trust enough.

15:14.958 --> 15:16.166
Crosshair?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.791
Just... [sighs] ...go,

15:20.083 --> 15:22.250
before you make things worse
for both of us.

15:31.208 --> 15:32.791
There has to be a way out of here.

15:33.291 --> 15:34.291
I'll find it.

18:07.500 --> 18:08.833
Good morning, Omega.

18:08.833 --> 18:09.958
Good morning.

18:10.458 --> 18:11.458
Let's begin.

19:31.791 --> 19:32.791
Batcher?

19:39.083 --> 19:41.000
K-9X1! Hurry!

19:42.500 --> 19:43.750
What is the issue?

19:43.750 --> 19:45.000
Batcher's hurt.

19:45.000 --> 19:48.583
LH-201 sustained injuries
during the nightly patrol.

19:48.583 --> 19:51.333
If her wounds do not heal,
the subject will be terminated.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.666
Then do something to help her!

19:53.666 --> 19:55.958
I am not a medical droid.

19:55.958 --> 19:57.958
It is not part of my programming.

20:20.125 --> 20:21.125
Now, look.

20:21.125 --> 20:23.416
I need to clean your wound
for it to get better.

20:23.916 --> 20:28.208
It'll only hurt for a second,
so put those teeth away and behave.

20:33.708 --> 20:36.541
See? That's not so bad.

20:40.791 --> 20:43.208
I dressed Batcher's wounds
as best as I could.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.625
At least she didn't bite me.

20:46.625 --> 20:48.125
That's progress, right?

20:49.708 --> 20:52.541
If she doesn't get better soon...

20:52.541 --> 20:56.083
Maybe I can steal a med kit from the lab
and see if there's anything I can use--

20:56.083 --> 20:57.541
Stop.

20:57.541 --> 21:01.041
What is your primary objective?

21:01.041 --> 21:02.416
Escape.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.166
Then stop wasting time on lost causes.

21:06.666 --> 21:10.833
Forget the hound, forget me,
and complete the mission.

21:11.416 --> 21:13.208
Not without you.

21:13.208 --> 21:19.125
If I get the chance to escape, I wouldn't
think twice about leaving you behind.

21:20.166 --> 21:21.291
You're lying!

21:22.000 --> 21:24.333
You wouldn't do that. You're my brother.

21:24.333 --> 21:26.583
I'm not them.

21:28.708 --> 21:30.291
I'm not giving up, Crosshair.

21:30.291 --> 21:31.750
I won't let you either.

21:42.958 --> 21:44.833
Omega.

21:51.083 --> 21:52.791
Don't risk anything for me.

21:54.041 --> 21:55.291
I belong in here.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.333
None of us belong in here.

22:47.833 --> 22:49.833
What's going on?

22:50.458 --> 22:53.000
Surprise inspection.
Standard procedure.

22:56.000 --> 22:57.000
Clear.

23:04.958 --> 23:06.083
Bring it here.

23:08.083 --> 23:10.541
We've been over this before, Omega.

23:10.541 --> 23:12.875
Personal items are forbidden.

23:12.875 --> 23:14.083
I'll dispose of it.

23:14.666 --> 23:15.666
Don't!

23:16.250 --> 23:17.791
Please, Emerie.

23:18.500 --> 23:20.125
It is for your own good.

23:23.291 --> 23:24.375
Come.

23:24.375 --> 23:25.666
We have work to do.

23:45.250 --> 23:51.208
The Emperor should be pleased
we accomplished a successful transfer.

23:51.208 --> 23:55.291
Not when the M-count was
severely diminished in the process.

23:55.291 --> 23:59.291
If we do not match or exceed
the specimens' original count,

23:59.291 --> 24:00.583
it is a failure.

24:03.333 --> 24:06.416
If you cannot produce the desired results,

24:06.416 --> 24:10.583
I'll have to reconsider the freedoms
I've given to your young assistant.

24:10.583 --> 24:15.333
I would hate to think you were
intentionally delaying this advancement.

24:15.333 --> 24:21.125
You should not question
my loyalty to science, Doctor.

24:21.125 --> 24:22.333
Of course.

24:22.333 --> 24:28.458
And we shall soon see if
the Emperor is as understanding as I am.

24:46.583 --> 24:47.958
Hey, Batcher.

24:48.625 --> 24:51.208
Look at you.
You're almost at a hundred percent.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.458
Did you not read
the standing orders for the day?

24:54.458 --> 24:57.208
LH-201 has been slated for termination.

24:57.208 --> 25:00.125
What? Why? She's healed.

25:00.125 --> 25:04.416
The creature's recent domesticated
disposition has been deemed a liability.

25:04.416 --> 25:07.375
But that's my fault, not hers.

25:07.375 --> 25:09.541
It is protocol.

25:12.125 --> 25:14.708
Let go!

25:18.708 --> 25:20.500
Security alert.

25:39.333 --> 25:41.125
Calling security.

25:53.333 --> 25:54.833
Batcher, come!

25:55.916 --> 25:59.625
Now you need to run away
and not come back, okay?

26:00.666 --> 26:02.291
And try not to bite anyone.

26:04.791 --> 26:06.791
I can't go with you yet.

26:07.291 --> 26:09.041
I have to get Crosshair first.

26:13.791 --> 26:15.958
Go on!

26:15.958 --> 26:17.458
Batcher, go!

26:30.500 --> 26:32.333
Breaking the rules, I see.

26:34.625 --> 26:37.625
And releasing a weak lurca hound
into the wild?

26:38.333 --> 26:41.250
I didn't know you were so cruel, Omega.

26:41.250 --> 26:44.708
Me? You were gonna terminate her.

26:44.708 --> 26:47.750
And you believe
your actions changed that outcome?

26:49.375 --> 26:50.833
Now, some rotations ago,

26:50.833 --> 26:54.083
one of our shuttles crashed
just beyond this mountain.

26:54.833 --> 26:56.541
But that is not what killed them.

26:57.166 --> 26:59.958
No,
it was the creatures that roam the jungle.

27:00.583 --> 27:05.916
Even our strongest lurca hounds struggle
against what's beyond these walls.

27:05.916 --> 27:12.166
And your domestication of LH-201
only made her vulnerable.

27:12.166 --> 27:14.666
You don't know she won't survive.

27:14.666 --> 27:16.375
She deserves a chance.

27:17.458 --> 27:21.333
Oh, the flawed logic
of an idealistic child.

27:21.833 --> 27:25.583
Emotion and sentiment have no place
within these walls.

27:26.208 --> 27:29.333
You would do well to remember that.

27:29.833 --> 27:31.250
Or what?

27:31.250 --> 27:34.583
Doctor,
perhaps I should return Omega to her room.

27:36.208 --> 27:37.666
You have more to say?

27:37.666 --> 27:41.375
I know you brought me here
to make Nala Se cooperate.

27:42.083 --> 27:43.666
You need her.

27:44.333 --> 27:46.833
She won't work for you if you hurt me.

27:49.916 --> 27:52.291
Of course I'm not gonna hurt you, Omega.

27:53.708 --> 27:57.791
Your friend in the detention block,
however, may not be as fortunate.

27:58.375 --> 27:59.583
Don't hurt Crosshair!

27:59.583 --> 28:01.000
He didn't do anything.

28:01.000 --> 28:06.291
I did have plans for CT-9904,
despite his resistance to reeducation,

28:06.291 --> 28:11.958
but I am willing to make a few sacrifices
if your misbehavior continues.

28:13.166 --> 28:16.500
Actions always have consequences.

28:17.000 --> 28:19.958
Sometimes not in the ways we imagine.

28:20.541 --> 28:23.750
Take her back to her room
and restrict her access.

28:50.166 --> 28:51.833
Go away.

28:52.833 --> 28:54.708
- Omega.
- Please. Just...

28:56.375 --> 28:57.458
go.
