Yeah.

52:45.917 --> 52:46.875
And you, Suzume?

52:47.000 --> 52:48.958
We actually put potato salad on top.

52:49.083 --> 52:50.958
- Say what?
- On fried udon?

52:52.500 --> 52:54.083
O-M-G.

52:55.000 --> 52:56.875
Think about the calories.

52:57.000 --> 52:58.458
Sooo hungry.

52:58.958 --> 53:00.208
Thanks for the meal!

53:04.208 --> 53:05.625
Delish!

53:05.750 --> 53:06.792

53:06.917 --> 53:07.708
Needs a beer!

53:08.042 --> 53:08.708
Should we?

53:11.083 --> 53:11.958
Sure, why not?

53:12.125 --> 53:13.625
Join us, Souta.

53:13.750 --> 53:15.708

53:20.500 --> 53:21.917
What's with that chair?

53:22.042 --> 53:23.083

Really?

53:37.958 --> 53:41.208
Do you travel like this all the time?

53:41.708 --> 53:42.708
Not all the time.

53:42.917 --> 53:44.292
I have a flat in Tokyo.

53:45.167 --> 53:48.375
After college, I plan to be a teacher.

53:51.708 --> 53:52.458
Yeah?

53:52.708 --> 53:53.500

53:53.625 --> 53:54.875
What about THIS job!?

53:55.000 --> 53:58.250
Being a Closer has been in my family for generations.

53:58.375 --> 53:59.583
I'll continue that.

54:00.417 --> 54:02.333
But it doesn't put food on the table.

54:02.458 --> 54:03.750
I see...

54:04.375 --> 54:05.708
But it's an important job.

54:06.167 --> 54:09.833
Most important jobs, people shouldn't see.

54:10.375 --> 54:12.458
I need to get back into my own body.

54:12.750 --> 54:15.625
So I can continue this and become a teacher.

54:20.167 --> 54:21.792
But... I'm already...

54:27.667 --> 54:29.042
Perhaps, I'm...

54:30.083 --> 54:32.500
already...

54:39.458 --> 54:41.292
It's getting farther.

54:41.750 --> 54:43.542
The light grows dimmer.

54:43.750 --> 54:45.417
And so do the voices.

55:59.583 --> 56:01.250

Nope.

56:19.250 --> 56:20.208
Mmhmm.

56:20.750 --> 56:23.458
Just be sure to send word to your guardian.

56:23.583 --> 56:24.417
I will.

56:24.792 --> 56:25.458

56:32.833 --> 56:34.708
Buy a ticket. Hurry!

56:34.917 --> 56:36.750
The bullet train?

56:36.875 --> 56:39.708
We know where Daijin is, so...

56:39.917 --> 56:41.500
It's the quickest way, right?

56:41.625 --> 56:42.875
To Tokyo, though?

56:43.000 --> 56:44.708
That'll take all my savings.

56:45.042 --> 56:47.625
You better pay me back, Mr. College Man.

56:47.792 --> 56:49.125
I gotcha.

The worm's gonna fall.

01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:02.957
The earth will break.

Souta, wake up!

01:09:21.707 --> 01:09:23.542
What am I supposed to do?

01:09:23.832 --> 01:09:24.957
Souta!?

01:09:25.082 --> 01:09:25.957
SOUTA!

I don't...

01:09:51.667 --> 01:09:53.542

01:09:53.667 --> 01:09:55.333
How can this...!?

01:10:16.583 --> 01:10:17.375
Hey, look at that!

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:18.583
Wow!

01:10:19.333 --> 01:10:20.458

01:10:20.583 --> 01:10:21.917
Beautiful...

01:11:08.208 --> 01:11:09.042
Mommy!

01:11:09.167 --> 01:11:09.958
Is it ready yet?

01:11:10.083 --> 01:11:11.583
Not even close.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:20.792

01:11:21.125 --> 01:11:22.083
Not yet.

01:11:29.417 --> 01:11:30.167
Now?

01:11:30.375 --> 01:11:32.375
Hmm, almost?

01:11:35.208 --> 01:11:36.750
Nooow!?

01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:38.417
Let's see...

01:11:40.792 --> 01:11:42.083
Here you go!

01:11:42.625 --> 01:11:44.583
Happy birthday, Suzume.

01:11:44.708 --> 01:11:46.208
Whoooa.

01:11:46.583 --> 01:11:49.125
Hey, is its face here?

01:11:49.292 --> 01:11:49.917
What?

01:11:50.042 --> 01:11:50.917
This is a chair.

01:11:51.042 --> 01:11:52.167
Just for you.

01:11:56.583 --> 01:11:58.083
How's that?

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.042
A chair for me!

01:12:04.167 --> 01:12:06.500
Thank you, Mommy!

01:12:07.708 --> 01:12:09.083
I'm gonna keep it

01:12:09.208 --> 01:12:10.458
forever and ever!

01:12:10.583 --> 01:12:12.042
Forever?

01:12:12.375 --> 01:12:15.250
Well, thank goodness I built it for you.

Where...

Souta?

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:56.083
Is this...?

I can't get in.

He's in the Ever-After.

01:13:29.417 --> 01:13:30.708
Souta.

01:13:30.833 --> 01:13:31.750
Souta?

01:13:31.875 --> 01:13:33.042
Souta!

01:13:33.375 --> 01:13:35.000
SOUTA!

01:13:37.792 --> 01:13:38.542
Suzume?

01:13:43.792 --> 01:13:45.542
Finally, just the two of us!

01:13:46.333 --> 01:13:48.417
This is all your fault!

01:13:48.542 --> 01:13:49.792
Give me Souta back!

01:13:49.917 --> 01:13:50.625
Can't.

01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:51.500
Why?

01:13:51.625 --> 01:13:53.500
He's not human anymore.

01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:57.583
Then make him human!

01:13:57.708 --> 01:13:59.292
Suzume, that hurts.

01:13:59.417 --> 01:14:00.250
Bring him BACK!

01:14:00.375 --> 01:14:02.167
I said that hurts!

01:14:02.292 --> 01:14:03.542

How could I--!?

You love me, right?

01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:10.042
I HATE--!

01:14:20.333 --> 01:14:21.542
Go away.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.792
Don't ever talk to me again.

01:14:25.667 --> 01:14:29.042
Suzume doesn't love me...

01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:45.833
I promise, I'll come save you.

01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:48.500
I return to you...

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:14.250
What--!?

01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:32.500
Hey, look at that girl.

01:15:32.750 --> 01:15:34.000
She's not wearing any shoes.

01:15:34.208 --> 01:15:36.250
You're right. Ew.

01:15:41.958 --> 01:15:43.500
Just look at her clothes.

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:44.833
That girl over there.

01:15:44.958 --> 01:15:45.708
Is she barefoot?

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:46.750
For real?

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.042
Munakata's condition has stabilized.

01:15:51.167 --> 01:15:54.167
Yeah, it was pretty bad yesterday.

01:15:54.208 --> 01:15:56.042
[HITSUJIRO MUNAKATA]
Souta's...

01:16:09.208 --> 01:16:12.333
Souta failed, didn't he?

01:16:12.458 --> 01:16:13.667
I-I'm sorry for barging in...

01:16:13.792 --> 01:16:18.250
I heard from Souta that you were in the hospital.

01:16:21.875 --> 01:16:24.750
Did he drag you into this?

01:16:25.542 --> 01:16:28.458
What is the fate of my grandson?

01:16:29.875 --> 01:16:32.583
He became a Keystone and went to the Ever-After...

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.750
I see.

01:16:35.458 --> 01:16:39.250
I saw the worm from my window yesterday.

01:16:39.875 --> 01:16:42.625
I wanted nothing more than to go myself...

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:46.875
but this old body of mine wouldn't listen.

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.333
That's why I want to know how to enter the Ever-After.

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:54.500
Why?

01:16:54.792 --> 01:16:56.958
Huh? Because... we have to save Souta!

01:16:57.083 --> 01:16:58.917
That isn't necessary.

01:16:59.042 --> 01:16:59.958
What?

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:03.458
Souta will spend decades now

01:17:03.583 --> 01:17:07.125
as a Keystone housing the gods.

01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:10.750
He is no longer of our realm.

01:17:10.958 --> 01:17:12.208
How could...

01:17:12.333 --> 01:17:13.500
But there must be a way to--

01:17:13.625 --> 01:17:17.500
Are you trying to waste my grandson's sacrifice?

01:17:17.625 --> 01:17:18.458
What?

01:17:18.583 --> 01:17:21.417
Who is the one who pierced the worm?

01:17:21.667 --> 01:17:23.833
Did you, with Souta?

01:17:23.958 --> 01:17:24.667
But that was...

01:17:24.792 --> 01:17:26.000
ANSWER ME!

01:17:26.125 --> 01:17:27.000
It was me!

01:17:27.375 --> 01:17:28.667
I see.

01:17:28.792 --> 01:17:30.417
That's fine!

01:17:30.542 --> 01:17:33.833
If you didn't, millions would have died!

01:17:33.958 --> 01:17:36.958
Take pride in your deed, keep your mouth shut,

01:17:37.083 --> 01:17:39.875
and return to whence you came!

01:17:45.250 --> 01:17:49.583
This world is not for the ordinary.

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:52.708
Forget everything that happened.

01:17:53.458 --> 01:17:55.375
How could I forget?

01:17:55.500 --> 01:17:58.292
I'll open the underground Gate again.

01:17:58.417 --> 01:18:00.625
What!? What are you saying?

01:18:00.750 --> 01:18:02.250
I have to get in!

01:18:02.375 --> 01:18:03.208
Impossible.

01:18:03.333 --> 01:18:04.958
You cannot enter it there!

01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:07.208
You mustn't open the Gate!

01:18:07.333 --> 01:18:08.458
Wait!

01:18:20.542 --> 01:18:23.000
The Ever-After is a beautiful place.

01:18:23.125 --> 01:18:25.125
But it is the domain of the departed.

01:18:25.417 --> 01:18:28.375
Does that not scare you?

01:18:28.708 --> 01:18:30.208
It doesn't.

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.250
Whether one lives or dies is a matter of luck.

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:35.000
I've always felt that way.

01:18:35.458 --> 01:18:36.250
But...

01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.542
I'm afraid of a world without Souta.

01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:54.208
There is but one Gate through which
people may traverse in their lifetime.

01:18:54.583 --> 01:18:57.250
You've been to the Ever-After before, no?

01:18:57.667 --> 01:19:00.125
What did you see there?

01:19:00.625 --> 01:19:02.000
That was...

01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:04.000
A young version of myself.

And, my mom...who passed away.

01:19:08.083 --> 01:19:14.250
I suspect you got lost in the Ever-After when you were young.

01:19:20.417 --> 01:19:24.750
You must find THAT Gate. From back then.

01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:37.792
It has been far too long.

01:34:47.583 --> 01:34:49.000
You're kidding me...

01:35:00.333 --> 01:35:01.833
Hey, it's fixed.

01:35:06.125 --> 01:35:07.333
Oh, come on!

01:35:08.042 --> 01:35:09.833
That could've ended much worse.

01:35:10.167 --> 01:35:13.375
Never mind that. Did those cats just talk?

01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:16.792
T-They totally did, didn't they?

01:35:17.042 --> 01:35:17.875
What the heck was that?

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:18.792
Supernatural stuff?

01:35:18.917 --> 01:35:20.542
Nah, that can't be possible.

01:35:20.667 --> 01:35:22.083
Excuse me!

01:35:22.792 --> 01:35:24.000
They won't stop.

01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:26.583
Serizawa!

01:35:26.708 --> 01:35:28.583
We're about 10km out, right?

01:35:28.917 --> 01:35:31.708
[Approximately 20km to your destination.]

01:35:31.875 --> 01:35:33.375
More like 20.

01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:34.875
It's still quite a ways away.

01:35:34.917 --> 01:35:36.083
[Return to the designated route.]

01:35:36.125 --> 01:35:36.958
I KNOW!

01:35:37.042 --> 01:35:38.333
I'm gonna run the rest.

01:35:39.208 --> 01:35:41.250
Thank you so much, Serizawa!

01:35:41.375 --> 01:35:42.542
You too, Tamaki!

01:35:52.750 --> 01:35:54.792
I'm going too.

01:35:55.125 --> 01:35:57.917
Thanks for getting us this far.

01:36:00.458 --> 01:36:04.125
I think you might actually make a great teacher...

01:36:05.667 --> 01:36:08.333
H-Hey, you guys...!

01:36:10.292 --> 01:36:12.833
What the heck was that all about?

01:36:17.958 --> 01:36:20.792
Man, I envy you, Souta.

01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:35.542
Tamaki?

01:36:36.292 --> 01:36:37.708
I give up.

01:36:39.208 --> 01:36:43.375
This is about you chasing someone you love, right?

01:36:44.625 --> 01:36:46.333
Th-This isn't a love thing.

01:36:50.083 --> 01:36:51.125
Hey, Suzume...

01:36:51.333 --> 01:36:52.917
Who are these guys?

01:36:53.042 --> 01:36:54.583
They're supposed to be gods?

01:36:54.792 --> 01:36:55.875
Gods!?

01:36:59.792 --> 01:37:02.375
What I said, in the parking lot...

01:37:03.250 --> 01:37:05.500
Sure, I've felt that way at times...

01:37:05.625 --> 01:37:07.917
But that's not the only thing I've felt.

01:37:08.250 --> 01:37:08.875
Yeah.

01:37:09.458 --> 01:37:12.208
You understand it's not the only thing...

01:37:13.667 --> 01:37:14.792
Me too.

01:37:15.917 --> 01:37:17.625
I'm sorry, Tamaki.

01:37:19.292 --> 01:37:22.667
Your first time home in 12 years.

01:37:35.250 --> 01:37:37.708
I'm home, Mommy!

01:37:41.625 --> 01:37:44.208
I'm home, Mom.

01:37:46.583 --> 01:37:49.625
Look at how much she's grown, Sis.

01:37:50.667 --> 01:37:54.375
I have no idea what she's about to do.

01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:02.792
Found it.

01:38:07.917 --> 01:38:13.625
[SUZUME'S IMPORTANT STUFF]

01:38:14.583 --> 01:38:16.125
A diary?

01:38:16.417 --> 01:38:17.167
Yeah.

01:38:17.292 --> 01:38:19.875
I don't remember exactly what happened back then.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:22.958
But, I do remember wandering through a door...

01:38:27.917 --> 01:38:36.375
[MARCH 11]

01:38:37.625 --> 01:38:41.208
[Tsunami warning.]

01:38:42.667 --> 01:38:47.875
[Those near the ocean,
please evacuate to high ground immediately.]

01:38:49.542 --> 01:38:50.542
Have you seen my mommy?

01:38:50.583 --> 01:38:52.917
- Are you alone?
- She was working at the hospital.

01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:54.042
Have you seen my mommy?

01:38:54.083 --> 01:38:57.542
- They haven't found Tsubame?
- That girl's still looking today.

01:38:57.583 --> 01:38:59.292
Do you know where my mommy is?

01:38:59.333 --> 01:39:01.333
- She's only four...
- Her mother's probably--

01:39:01.375 --> 01:39:03.250
- The poor thing.
- Have you seen my mommy...?

01:39:03.292 --> 01:39:04.208
She's all alone.

01:39:04.250 --> 01:39:06.833
- I'm sorry, Suzume.
- My mommy...!

01:39:06.958 --> 01:39:08.333
Sorry.

01:39:08.458 --> 01:39:09.708
Mommy...!

01:39:09.833 --> 01:39:11.708
Where are you?

01:39:15.583 --> 01:39:18.000
It wasn't...a dream.

01:39:18.833 --> 01:39:21.125
That's right, the moon was full that night.

01:39:21.542 --> 01:39:23.917
Right by that telephone pole.

01:39:24.792 --> 01:39:25.833
What?

01:39:25.958 --> 01:39:27.500
You're looking for this door?

01:39:27.625 --> 01:39:29.875
Hey, Suzume!

01:39:30.208 --> 01:39:33.708
It's been 12 years! The rubble's probably long gone!

01:39:38.792 --> 01:39:39.833
Where...?

01:39:42.708 --> 01:39:43.708
Suzume.

01:39:45.042 --> 01:39:46.042

01:39:49.208 --> 01:39:50.958
Hey, what're...?

01:40:06.958 --> 01:40:09.458
Daijin, have you...?

01:40:09.792 --> 01:40:13.458
Have you been guiding us to the open doors all this time?

01:40:14.458 --> 01:40:15.625
This whole time...

01:40:21.542 --> 01:40:22.917
Whoa...!

01:40:23.542 --> 01:40:25.292
Thank you so much, Daijin!

01:40:27.917 --> 01:40:29.208
Let's go, Suzume!

01:40:31.208 --> 01:40:32.708
Suzume!

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:33.875
Tamaki.

01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:35.375
I'm going!

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:36.958
Going where?

01:40:37.125 --> 01:40:38.458
To see the person I love!

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:47.208
Suzume...?

01:40:59.333 --> 01:41:01.083
The ground is on fire.

01:41:04.417 --> 01:41:05.208
That's...

01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:06.917
The worm!

01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:13.583
It's going for the Gate!

01:41:24.708 --> 01:41:25.708
Sadaijin?

01:41:41.958 --> 01:41:42.958
Is that...?

01:41:43.583 --> 01:41:44.458
Souta!?

01:42:03.875 --> 01:42:04.958
Daijin, you...!

01:42:07.417 --> 01:42:09.208
Suzume, are you okay?

01:42:11.917 --> 01:42:13.458
What is this place?

01:42:14.458 --> 01:42:16.417
This is the Ever-After?

01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:19.042
It's Souta!

Souta!

Souta!!

01:43:09.458 --> 01:43:10.125
SOUTA!

01:43:17.208 --> 01:43:17.875
Suzume.

01:43:18.458 --> 01:43:19.708
If you take the Keystone,

01:43:19.833 --> 01:43:21.583
the worm will escape.

01:43:21.708 --> 01:43:23.375
I'll become the Keystone!

01:43:24.833 --> 01:43:26.208
So please...

01:43:27.250 --> 01:43:30.417
Wake up, Souta!

01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:34.250
You...

01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:48.542
Souta!

01:43:48.667 --> 01:43:51.500
I've come this far!

01:43:52.167 --> 01:43:54.083
Please, answer me!

01:43:54.917 --> 01:43:56.083
Souta!

01:43:56.208 --> 01:43:57.833
Let me hear your voice.

01:43:58.042 --> 01:43:59.458
SOUTA!

01:43:59.833 --> 01:44:01.333
SOUTA!!!

01:44:07.625 --> 01:44:09.208
Hey, you...

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:13.708
Do you know of any ruins in this area?

01:44:14.125 --> 01:44:15.083
Ruins...?

01:44:17.667 --> 01:44:20.417
Are you not afraid to die!?

01:44:20.542 --> 01:44:21.333
I'm not!

01:44:21.458 --> 01:44:23.208
We make a great team!

01:44:23.333 --> 01:44:25.333
I think I'm doing something pretty important!

01:44:25.583 --> 01:44:26.667
Join us.

01:44:26.917 --> 01:44:29.333
Well, aren't you popular, Souta?

01:44:29.500 --> 01:44:30.708
Wait!

01:44:31.083 --> 01:44:32.208
Is this...?

01:44:32.333 --> 01:44:33.208
Yeah.

01:44:33.417 --> 01:44:35.958
This is it...

01:44:36.375 --> 01:44:38.083
This is where I end?

01:44:38.375 --> 01:44:40.667
Souta's memories?

01:44:41.500 --> 01:44:43.917
- Souta?
- But, I was able to meet you.

01:44:43.917 --> 01:44:44.750
- Souta!
- But, I was able to meet you.

01:44:44.917 --> 01:44:46.250
Hey! Souta!

01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:48.333
I finally met you!

01:44:48.458 --> 01:44:49.417
SOUTA!

01:44:49.708 --> 01:44:50.917
I don't want to disappear.

01:44:51.042 --> 01:44:52.167
I want to live!

01:44:52.375 --> 01:44:53.417
I want to keep living!

01:44:53.542 --> 01:44:55.083
I'm afraid to die!

01:44:55.625 --> 01:44:56.458
I want to live.

01:44:56.583 --> 01:44:57.583
To live...

01:44:57.708 --> 01:44:58.583
To live.

01:44:58.958 --> 01:45:00.250
More!

01:45:02.250 --> 01:45:04.042
So do I!

01:45:04.708 --> 01:45:06.792
I want to live more...

01:45:07.083 --> 01:45:08.333
I want to hear your voice.

01:45:08.542 --> 01:45:09.958
I don't want to be alone.

01:45:10.083 --> 01:45:12.042
I'm afraid to die.

01:45:12.167 --> 01:45:13.375
Souta...

01:45:51.167 --> 01:45:52.375
Souta...?

01:45:54.333 --> 01:45:55.875
Suzume?

01:45:58.167 --> 01:45:59.458
What was I...?

01:46:02.292 --> 01:46:03.542
Daijin?

01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:05.542
What's wrong?

01:46:06.208 --> 01:46:07.417
You okay?

01:46:09.667 --> 01:46:11.125
I...

01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:14.875
couldn't become your cat, Suzume.

01:46:15.625 --> 01:46:17.917
Return me...

01:46:18.208 --> 01:46:20.125
...with your hands.

01:46:24.792 --> 01:46:26.167
Daijin...

01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.167
The second Keystone...!

01:46:38.250 --> 01:46:40.292
The worm's going to escape from the Gate!

01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:04.500
Suzume!

01:47:04.625 --> 01:47:05.583
I'm fine.

01:47:06.208 --> 01:47:07.083
What now?

01:47:07.208 --> 01:47:09.083
Hear their voices, and they'll hear us.

01:47:09.708 --> 01:47:10.750
Follow me!

01:47:20.333 --> 01:47:22.750
O Divine Gods who dwell beneath this land...

01:47:23.875 --> 01:47:26.250
You have long protected us for generations...

01:47:27.167 --> 01:47:30.167
Thy mountains and rivers that we have long called our own...

01:47:30.625 --> 01:47:35.000
We respectfully return to thee!

01:47:39.875 --> 01:47:40.625
"Morning!"

01:47:40.750 --> 01:47:43.292
"Good morning!"

01:47:43.417 --> 01:47:44.083
"Bon appetit!"

01:47:44.208 --> 01:47:45.583
"Thanks for the food."

01:47:45.708 --> 01:47:47.750
"I'll see you later!"

01:47:47.875 --> 01:47:49.750
"See you soon."

01:47:49.958 --> 01:47:50.750
"Come home soon."

01:47:50.875 --> 01:47:52.000
- "See you later!"
- "Come home soon."

01:47:52.125 --> 01:47:53.167
- "See you soon!"
- "See you soon."

01:47:53.292 --> 01:47:54.583
- "I'm off now."
- "Take care."

01:47:54.708 --> 01:47:55.917
- "See you later."
- "Come home soon."

01:47:56.042 --> 01:47:57.417
- "Don't be too late."
- "I'll see you soon."

01:47:57.542 --> 01:47:59.083
- "Take care!"
- "See you soon."

01:47:59.208 --> 01:48:00.542
"See you later."

01:48:01.667 --> 01:48:04.417
I know that life is fleeting.

01:48:04.833 --> 01:48:07.667
We live side-by-side with death.

01:48:08.667 --> 01:48:10.167
Even then...

01:48:10.500 --> 01:48:11.917
once more...

01:48:12.125 --> 01:48:13.917
even for just one moment more

01:48:14.333 --> 01:48:16.167
we wish to live!

01:48:17.167 --> 01:48:18.833
Divine gods...!

01:48:19.333 --> 01:48:21.458
Please... Please!

01:48:21.708 --> 01:48:23.167
I beg of you!

01:48:29.583 --> 01:48:30.458
It's okay.

01:48:30.583 --> 01:48:31.708
Entrust yourself.

01:48:53.750 --> 01:48:55.000
I return to you!!

01:49:42.833 --> 01:49:44.208
Suzume...

01:50:02.417 --> 01:50:04.542
Suzume, there's someone here...

01:50:05.625 --> 01:50:06.542
A child?

01:50:07.583 --> 01:50:08.542
That girl...

01:50:08.792 --> 01:50:11.042
I...need to go!

01:50:11.375 --> 01:50:12.750
Suzume?

01:50:22.208 --> 01:50:23.292
I see...

01:50:24.125 --> 01:50:25.708
That's right.

01:50:27.208 --> 01:50:29.000
I finally understand!

01:50:37.792 --> 01:50:39.042
Suzume.

01:50:40.458 --> 01:50:41.667
Suzume!

01:50:47.333 --> 01:50:48.292
Mommy?

01:50:50.833 --> 01:50:52.042
No...

01:50:53.667 --> 01:50:55.917
Do you know where my mommy is?

01:50:56.042 --> 01:50:57.958
I know she's looking for me, too!
