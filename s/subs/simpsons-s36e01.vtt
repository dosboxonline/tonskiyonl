This show was such a special

When the very first episode
aired in 1989,

02:07.795 --> 02:09.378
The viewers agreed on one thing:

02:09.380 --> 02:11.797
It wasn't as funny

For the bart balloon in

So, fox had to keep
making new episodes

03:22.244 --> 03:23.619
To amortize the cost.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.496
Thus, the quest to end
<i> the simpsons</i> went on.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.166
In fact,
many now-classic episodes

Of   <i> mad men, breaking bad,</i>

04:22.763 --> 04:25.055

their brains to create a finale
