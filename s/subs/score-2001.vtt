WEBVTT

03:43.976 --> 03:45.728
Wait.

03:45.770 --> 03:46.771
What?

03:48.481 --> 03:49.607
This.

03:51.109 --> 03:52.151
Later.

03:53.778 --> 03:55.739
I wanna smoke.

03:58.450 --> 04:00.369
I wanna smoke.

04:01.954 --> 04:04.039
Fine. Smoke.

04:07.543 --> 04:09.462
Smoke all night.

05:14.907 --> 05:17.702
Be still.
Do not turn around.

05:17.786 --> 05:19.621
Do not turn around.

05:19.704 --> 05:21.623
You will not be hurt.

10:43.888 --> 10:45.806
- Bonjour, Nick.
- Bonjour, madame.

11:34.317 --> 11:35.402
Albert.

11:38.196 --> 11:40.490
Boss, hi.

11:40.574 --> 11:43.494
- Jean-Claude.
- So, the trip was good?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.123
- So, how are we doing?
- Great.

11:47.164 --> 11:49.625
We have many reservations
for tonight.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.711
Good. How many covers
did we have last night?

11:51.794 --> 11:53.713
- Over 150.
- Good.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.633
- Bar was steady.
- How was the music?

11:56.674 --> 11:59.261
- Great band.
- Good. Good.

12:03.640 --> 12:05.684
Scotch on the rocks, please,
little water.

12:05.768 --> 12:07.686
Yeah, sure.

12:24.162 --> 12:26.332
Monsieur Max.

12:26.415 --> 12:29.084
Where-- Where Nicky?

12:30.836 --> 12:34.090
Voila. Back from Bermuda.

12:34.173 --> 12:35.633
Did you have a good trip?

12:35.717 --> 12:38.511
Well, not as interesting
as yours, I'm sure.

12:40.096 --> 12:43.183
My God!
Let me get a look at you.

12:43.225 --> 12:45.769
You look like shit.
What's your secret?

12:46.895 --> 12:48.856
Jean-Claude,
set up number two for us.

12:48.898 --> 12:50.441
Yeah, sure.

12:57.448 --> 12:59.909
Just give us a little room.
Thank you.

13:03.497 --> 13:05.123
For sure.

13:05.207 --> 13:07.126
There we are.

13:12.173 --> 13:13.591
Bermuda.

13:17.428 --> 13:18.847
Oh, God.

13:20.390 --> 13:22.309
Well.

13:22.392 --> 13:26.104
- It was pretty tight out there.
- Good. It'll keep you sharp.

13:28.107 --> 13:31.277
I got a minor development.

13:31.360 --> 13:34.196
- We lost the buyer.
- What do you mean, "lost"?

13:34.280 --> 13:37.992
Well, she's in a brass casket
six feet underground...

13:38.076 --> 13:40.245
never to be heard from again.

13:41.204 --> 13:43.248
Well, I fronted 20,000
in expenses.

13:43.290 --> 13:46.001
Now I'm due that,
plus 250 for my end.

13:46.084 --> 13:48.086
You don't think I'm not
gonna take care of you?

13:48.128 --> 13:50.130
I'm not gonna cover
your expenses and all that?

13:50.214 --> 13:53.801
It's not about covering my expenses.
It's the money. Find another buyer.

13:53.884 --> 13:56.304
Of course. But Jesus Christ,
shit happens.

13:56.387 --> 13:58.514
This thing's gonna drag out.
You've got to be patient.

13:59.182 --> 14:02.560
Wait a minute.
How about this?

14:02.644 --> 14:05.689
Four big ones
in your hand.

14:05.772 --> 14:08.066
Four million dollars
in your mitt.

14:08.942 --> 14:11.403
- Four million?
- More than you ever dreamed of.

14:11.487 --> 14:14.365
More than we ever,
ever did together.

14:14.448 --> 14:16.617
Four million.
What are you into?

14:16.659 --> 14:19.912
Well, I spotted this item
which was really exceptional.

14:19.996 --> 14:23.875
It was European antiquity,
elegant...

14:23.958 --> 14:26.711
and it was in the hands
of this real dumb prick...

14:26.795 --> 14:28.380
that didn't know what he had.

14:29.423 --> 14:31.467
And unfortunately...

14:31.550 --> 14:33.969
it's become detained
in transit a little.

14:37.515 --> 14:39.559
You don't wanna know where?

14:39.642 --> 14:41.352
It depends.

14:41.436 --> 14:42.937
Depends on what?

14:43.021 --> 14:46.024
- On what you're gonna tell me.
- Okay.

14:46.107 --> 14:49.403
It's in the Montreal
Customshouse.

14:51.947 --> 14:55.659
- No way. I'm sorry.
- Oh, yeah. Wait a minute.

14:55.701 --> 14:58.704
I got a guy--
I got a guy inside.

14:58.788 --> 15:03.209
He gives you the whole layout,
handles security, everything--

15:03.293 --> 15:08.256
You used to tell me, "Steal outside
the country, in the States, Europe.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.841
But Montreal,
live in Montreal."

15:09.883 --> 15:12.553
I said a lot of dumb things
in my day, didn't I?

15:12.636 --> 15:13.929
- But that's--
- Right.

15:15.139 --> 15:19.769
Let's just find another buyer
for this. I gotta open the place.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.647
Okay, but I'm not finished
talking about this.

15:24.899 --> 15:28.445
- Come on.
- You're making a large error here.

15:34.827 --> 15:36.745
Not bad.

15:48.675 --> 15:50.427
- Yeah?
- I just landed.

15:50.510 --> 15:52.429
I got the delivery.

16:14.453 --> 16:15.954
Got the bag?

16:16.038 --> 16:18.832
- Yeah. Right here.
- Where's Johnny?

16:18.916 --> 16:22.253
He got it in Istanbul,
right through the neck.

16:22.295 --> 16:24.547
- Jesus. He was a good kid.
- Yeah.

16:24.630 --> 16:26.341
Good and dead.

16:26.424 --> 16:28.384
So you wanna talk,
or you wanna see what I got?

16:28.468 --> 16:30.929
How can I be sure
you're okay?

16:32.305 --> 16:33.890
I suppose I could fuck you.

16:34.766 --> 16:36.185
That would work.

16:57.457 --> 16:59.918
Hey. You okay?

17:01.045 --> 17:02.546
Yeah. Great.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.930
- How was your trip?
- I don't know.

17:11.806 --> 17:13.892
Cities.

17:13.974 --> 17:17.980
They're all starting to look
the same. They really are.

17:24.819 --> 17:28.281
And the pasta in Rome
is not as good as yours.

17:30.118 --> 17:32.036
And the ass pinchers.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.664
They used to look
so charmingly European.

17:34.748 --> 17:36.666
Not as good as me?

17:41.171 --> 17:43.132
Come on.

17:44.008 --> 17:46.302
It really must be
what it is about you I like...

17:46.344 --> 17:48.846
because you most definitely
are not common.

17:55.312 --> 17:57.898
- What if I were?
- What if you were what?

17:57.981 --> 18:01.026
A little more common,
you know, and around more.

18:01.110 --> 18:03.028
How much more?

18:03.112 --> 18:05.197
Like, "all the time" more.

18:05.281 --> 18:07.658
And I was just a jazz club owner
and not that other thing.

18:07.700 --> 18:09.076
How would you feel
about that?

18:11.579 --> 18:14.124
Hey, are you saying
what I think you're saying?

18:14.207 --> 18:16.751
I think that's
what I'm saying.

18:21.131 --> 18:25.427
Hey, baby, you know I've never
asked you to change anything for me.

18:25.511 --> 18:28.598
I know that. I'm just asking you,
how would you feel about that?

18:36.147 --> 18:38.275
I don't know.

18:40.611 --> 18:43.614
I suppose I'd have to give it
some serious thought.

18:45.741 --> 18:48.536
Then you'd better start
giving it some serious thought.

18:58.213 --> 19:01.466
Thank you.
So I'll see you when I see you?

19:01.550 --> 19:03.469
See you when I see you.

19:42.594 --> 19:45.848
Excuse me.
Can you help me, please?

19:47.016 --> 19:49.101
Can you help me?

19:49.185 --> 19:51.312
- Place Norman?
- Yes, yes.

19:51.395 --> 19:53.898
You go to the corner,
make a right. Go two blocks--

19:53.981 --> 19:57.151
- Two.
- Two blocks, then a left one block.

19:57.235 --> 19:59.738
- Again, please.
- Two blocks this way...

19:59.779 --> 20:01.323
one block that way
to the left.

20:01.406 --> 20:03.950
- And you're right there.
- Okay, thank you.

20:04.034 --> 20:05.577
Thank you, Nick.

20:07.913 --> 20:09.665
What did you say?

20:09.748 --> 20:12.251
I said, "Thank you, Nick."

20:14.629 --> 20:18.675
I'm Max's guy in the customshouse.
We should talk.

20:20.218 --> 20:22.220
Okay, bye-bye. Thank you.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.222
Thank you. Bye.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.065
- Where's Max?
- He's in the sunroom.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.781
Nicoli, Nicoli.

20:39.823 --> 20:42.033
Have you lost
your fucking mind?

20:42.117 --> 20:45.078
My mind? Years ago. Why?

20:45.162 --> 20:48.081
- What did you tell this kid?
- What did I tell who?

20:48.165 --> 20:50.125
Your inside guy
with the retard act.

20:50.209 --> 20:52.294
He was in front of my house.
He knew who I was.

20:54.255 --> 20:58.217
Wait. He must've followed me to
the club and made you from there.

20:58.301 --> 21:00.720
Tell him he pulls a stunt like that
again, he'll end up in the hospital.

21:00.803 --> 21:04.975
Wait. Do you think I'm gonna set
you up with a jerk-off heister?

21:05.058 --> 21:08.353
You gotta admit that this kid did
a pretty good dog and pony show.

21:08.395 --> 21:12.233
I don't care who is he. Don't expose
me like that. You know better.

21:12.316 --> 21:13.776
He's got it all pre-wired.

21:13.859 --> 21:16.195
- You go in, turn the key--
- I told you, I'm not interested.

21:16.237 --> 21:19.615
You're never gonna get another
chance at a score like this.

21:19.699 --> 21:21.659
- Why are you pushing this?
- Four million balls.

21:21.743 --> 21:23.536
How many times
do I have to tell you?

21:23.620 --> 21:25.330
He's pushing it
because we're running out of time.

21:26.373 --> 21:29.167
If I'm gonna work
with a partner on this...

21:29.209 --> 21:31.086
we gotta start putting
our heads together right away.

21:31.170 --> 21:32.630
- What are you doing in my house?
- Take it easy.

21:32.713 --> 21:35.424
- All I'm saying--
- Who the fuck is this kid?

21:35.508 --> 21:38.177
- What the fuck do you know?
- I've been on this for three weeks.

21:38.261 --> 21:41.222
I gotta know if you're the guy
that Max says you are.

21:41.306 --> 21:44.476
- I gotta go.
- Nick, wait. Wait.

21:45.810 --> 21:49.731
I didn't come 500 miles just to--
Jack Teller. Nice to meet you too.

21:49.773 --> 21:50.732
What the fuck?

21:50.774 --> 21:53.569
You're not smart enough
to know where your dick is.

21:53.652 --> 21:56.822
We decided that you were gonna
sit tight until I called you.

21:56.906 --> 21:58.240
- Is that correct?
- Okay.

21:58.282 --> 22:01.077
I thought I could help you sell him
on it. I thought he was already in.

22:01.160 --> 22:04.622
Don't be so fucking creative.
Just get the fuck out of my house.

22:04.706 --> 22:08.293
When you guys get your shit
together, give me a call, okay?

22:08.376 --> 22:09.628
Unbelievable.

22:14.049 --> 22:19.013
It's a lucky thing
you came my way

22:20.223 --> 22:22.392
Today

22:22.475 --> 22:26.521
I'm about to tell you
something you should know

22:29.441 --> 22:33.445
All you have to do
is let the plot unfold

22:36.323 --> 22:38.784
Desire is clear

22:38.826 --> 22:40.494
When you are near

22:40.578 --> 22:42.538
You're about to give in

22:45.625 --> 22:48.336
Don't tease me so

22:48.420 --> 22:49.880
I think you know

22:49.963 --> 22:52.132
You're about to give in

22:54.718 --> 22:58.472
And if you listen
we can both find peace

23:00.349 --> 23:02.685
Release

23:02.768 --> 23:06.314
Inhibitions that you
thought could not be there

24:15.764 --> 24:17.266
Jesus!

24:18.308 --> 24:20.269
God! Jesus! Take it easy.

24:21.729 --> 24:25.566
Listen close. Leave town
tonight. Don't come back.

24:25.608 --> 24:28.778
I see you again,
I break your fucking knees.

24:28.861 --> 24:30.321
I see you around Nick,
I'll kill ya.

24:30.405 --> 24:33.450
It's a dangerous fucking game
you're playing here.

24:33.533 --> 24:35.202
Are we clear?

24:41.208 --> 24:43.127
Yeah, we're clear.

25:23.963 --> 25:26.006
How did it go?

25:26.090 --> 25:27.508
Not as planned.

25:28.384 --> 25:32.680
- What do you want?
- Some fucking respect for starters.

25:33.515 --> 25:37.519
I mean, what are you thinking?
Now, I'm on a job here.

25:37.602 --> 25:40.522
Now, if you just don't wanna come
in on it, that's fine. Say "no."

25:40.606 --> 25:43.484
But don't send some third-rate
rent-a-thug to brush me off.

25:43.525 --> 25:45.194
You can do it
like a professional.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.156
Hello.

25:50.449 --> 25:53.411
Yeah. You okay?

25:53.494 --> 25:55.955
He's right here. Don't worry.
Just go home.

25:56.039 --> 25:59.251
I'll call you later, all right?
That's okay.

25:59.334 --> 26:00.752
Okay.

26:01.878 --> 26:04.047
I didn't come here
to cause any trouble.

26:04.131 --> 26:05.549
I didn't.

26:06.634 --> 26:10.471
Coming up to you on the street
like that, that was a stupid move.

26:10.555 --> 26:12.807
Sorry. Why don't we
just call it even?

26:12.890 --> 26:15.435
I just wanna say one thing to you,
then I'll go away.

26:15.518 --> 26:18.021
We don't have to bother each other
anymore if you don't want.

26:21.149 --> 26:24.194
I have been casing this place
for a couple of weeks now.

26:24.236 --> 26:27.948
It's a little bit complicated,
but this is a very doable job.

26:28.032 --> 26:31.285
I can handle the system in there
if someone can break into this box.

26:33.079 --> 26:35.039
Look, I don't know you,
you don't know me.

26:35.081 --> 26:37.584
I know that's not
the best way to do things, but...

26:37.625 --> 26:40.253
I am very good
at what I do, okay?

26:40.337 --> 26:44.091
And I take it very, very seriously.
You can check it out with Max.

26:44.174 --> 26:47.386
Now, if you are the guy
that he says you are...

26:47.469 --> 26:50.264
then we should check this out.

26:50.347 --> 26:52.266
Just--Just take a look at it.

26:52.350 --> 26:55.269
That's all I'm saying,
'cause this is a very big payoff...

26:55.353 --> 26:57.272
for very acceptable risks.

27:03.945 --> 27:06.490
Just take a look at it.
Go look for yourself.

27:10.286 --> 27:12.830
I like your place.

27:12.913 --> 27:14.832
You got good taste.

28:54.481 --> 28:57.193
Oh, Jesus.
It's nice and dark in here.

28:57.234 --> 28:59.278
Fucking everything.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.075
Jesus.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.828
Why don't you jump
for some lights in this place?

29:06.912 --> 29:11.542
Every time I come in here,
it's like hide-and-go-seek.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.544
How are you?

29:25.223 --> 29:29.227
Now, you gotta tell me the--

29:29.269 --> 29:31.939
the magic word.

29:32.022 --> 29:33.857
All right, I'm gonna do it.

29:33.941 --> 29:38.070
Good, good. Jesus, sweetheart.
You're a sweetheart.

29:38.154 --> 29:40.072
Bravo.
You're making sense.

29:41.199 --> 29:45.119
But because of the risk involved,
my end's gotta be six million.

29:47.998 --> 29:49.207
Operator?

29:49.291 --> 29:52.085
I got a nut down here
that just said six million.

29:53.420 --> 29:56.256
No, no. Send paramedics.
I think-- Are you all right?

29:56.340 --> 29:57.383
I'm fine.

29:57.466 --> 30:00.136
Six fucking million dollars?
What happened to four?

30:00.219 --> 30:03.848
I'm doing it in my backyard. I'm
not gonna go like that. I'm sorry.

30:03.931 --> 30:05.850
If you want me to do this,
you gotta pay me what's right.

30:05.934 --> 30:08.979
- It's gotta be that way.
- I always pay you what's right.

30:09.062 --> 30:12.315
You always think you do.
I always know what you pay me.

30:12.399 --> 30:15.152
It's not always right.
I need this for this.

30:16.904 --> 30:18.197
I like your style.

30:18.280 --> 30:20.199
Yeah, well, okay.
I understand.

30:21.826 --> 30:25.038
That's what I have to do. I wanna
pay off the club, the mortgage.

30:25.121 --> 30:26.831
I wanna own this place
free and clear.

30:26.915 --> 30:29.417
I want it to be mine.
I live the way I want.

30:29.501 --> 30:30.794
Because after this,
no more jobs.

30:30.877 --> 30:34.131
This is the last one I'm doing.
I'm quitting for good.

30:34.214 --> 30:36.925
How many times have you
told me that in 25 years?

30:36.967 --> 30:39.303
I'm gonna believe that
when the pigs eat my brother.

30:39.345 --> 30:42.640
- Right?
- I'm done. I'm done. No more.

30:45.059 --> 30:48.480
Well, okay.
I hope she's worth it.

30:52.609 --> 30:54.528
Here's numb-nuts.

30:57.489 --> 31:00.326
Nice house, nice club.
You must be really good.

31:03.537 --> 31:05.665
I don't wanna have to do this,
but raise your arms.

31:08.459 --> 31:11.379
- Be my guest.
- He's all right.

31:14.674 --> 31:16.134
Okay?

31:23.225 --> 31:26.187
Is this a social call?
What are we doing here?

31:28.231 --> 31:29.816
I will explore this with you...

31:29.858 --> 31:32.694
but I run this operation
down to the smallest detail.

31:32.736 --> 31:36.031
If you have a problem with that,
we can all go home right now.

31:36.865 --> 31:38.492
Is there a problem with that?

31:39.618 --> 31:41.370
That's fine.

31:41.412 --> 31:44.498
You will tell me everything you
know, then I will design the plan.

31:44.540 --> 31:48.419
If I smell something about the job
or you that I don't like, I walk.

31:48.503 --> 31:51.589
If I think for one second you're
not living up to your end of it...

31:51.673 --> 31:54.426
or if you hold out on me
in any way, I walk.

31:54.509 --> 31:57.012
- Understood?
- That's fine.

31:57.054 --> 31:58.639
Tell me what you wanna know.

31:59.890 --> 32:03.936
- First, what are we looking for?
- You know what a scepter is?

32:04.019 --> 32:05.980
It's something
that a king holds.

32:07.106 --> 32:08.775
Right there.

32:08.858 --> 32:13.154
It was made in 1661 in France
for a special coronation...

32:14.364 --> 32:16.032
for a girl queen.

32:17.117 --> 32:19.953
- It's priceless.
- Not to us, it's not.

32:20.037 --> 32:23.082
What can you give me
on its specific location?

32:23.165 --> 32:25.459
I can give you the whole
building, okay? I got floor plans.

32:25.543 --> 32:28.170
I've been clocking the security
patterns for over three weeks.

32:28.254 --> 32:30.381
All right.
Paint me a picture.

32:31.591 --> 32:34.260
Okay. He fixed me up
with the job.

32:34.344 --> 32:36.805
Not me but Brian,
the guy on the street.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.223
Yeah, I remember.

32:38.265 --> 32:41.101
Is he traceable? Phone number?
Address? That stuff?

32:41.185 --> 32:43.520
It's totally tight. The guy's
a charity case, a favor.

32:43.604 --> 32:45.606
The guy truly doesn't
even exist on paper.

32:45.689 --> 32:48.734
He just shows up.
He's the assistant janitor...

32:48.818 --> 32:50.570
midnight to 8 a.m.

32:55.950 --> 32:57.577
The security's pretty basic.

32:57.661 --> 33:00.122
At night, they lock the place down.
They bar the ground floor windows.

33:00.163 --> 33:03.751
You can only enter in through
one place, out by the truck court.

33:07.296 --> 33:09.966
Thank you, Hubert.
Thank you.

33:10.049 --> 33:12.760
Manpower's very light. They got one
guy sitting in a booth outside...

33:12.844 --> 33:15.221
just keeping an eye
on things.

33:16.890 --> 33:20.811
On the inside, everyone comes in
through a standard metal detector.

33:20.852 --> 33:24.940
It's tricky bringing things through,
but I've got that figured out.

33:24.982 --> 33:27.776
All the guards know me now,
so no one really looks too close.

33:27.818 --> 33:30.154
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

33:30.237 --> 33:32.573
Once I'm inside,
I can go anywhere I want.

33:32.657 --> 33:34.117
Hey, Laurent.

33:34.158 --> 33:37.871
Everything gets run from this
one little central command console.

33:37.954 --> 33:41.792
They've got fixed video systems in
the elevators and in the hallways.

33:41.833 --> 33:44.920
They got a couple magnetic doors,
but it's all very basic.

33:45.003 --> 33:48.591
Lots of overtime.
Not so much now.

33:48.674 --> 33:50.968
Now, the head janitor's
this old guy, Danny.

33:51.010 --> 33:53.387
He loves Brian.
Loves him.

33:53.471 --> 33:55.848
I've got this guy completely
wrapped around my finger.

33:55.932 --> 33:58.351
He'd do anything for me.

33:58.393 --> 34:00.437
And most of the time,
he's got me working with him.

34:00.520 --> 34:02.314
Kind of low-level shit,
just helping out.

34:02.355 --> 34:05.734
But I can get away from him plenty.
I got all kinds of reasons.

34:05.818 --> 34:09.280
I've sketched half the place
already. I've copied a lot of keys.

34:09.362 --> 34:12.533
I can get you access to basically
any room in the place.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.159
Where's the scepter?

34:14.202 --> 34:17.121
Well, see, that's the kink.

34:17.205 --> 34:18.748
Now, get this.

34:18.831 --> 34:21.751
It was arranged to be
brought into the country...

34:21.835 --> 34:25.839
inside the leg
of an antique piano.

34:25.880 --> 34:29.677
And it was so simple.
Then they impounded it.

34:29.717 --> 34:31.719
I mean, can you guess why?

34:31.762 --> 34:34.599
Fucking bugs.

34:34.681 --> 34:38.186
I mean, the whole shipment
was contaminated with termites.

34:38.268 --> 34:40.230
Asian longhorn beetles.

34:41.313 --> 34:43.233
We got fucked by bugs.

34:45.694 --> 34:47.196
These things
burrow into the wood...

34:47.279 --> 34:49.156
so they were in the crates
of most of the shipment.

34:49.239 --> 34:51.699
So they took the goods out
and delivered most of them.

34:51.784 --> 34:54.578
But the piano is made of wood too,
so they impounded it.

34:54.661 --> 34:56.831
They took the whole thing
and put it in quarantine.

34:56.914 --> 34:59.542
Medium security,
third-floor lockup.

34:59.584 --> 35:01.169
They're really scared
of these things...

35:01.252 --> 35:02.921
and they can't send
them back to France.

35:05.590 --> 35:07.759
So they decided
to burn everything.

35:16.811 --> 35:18.771
Now, I'll tell ya...

35:18.813 --> 35:21.149
I didn't know which one of the
fucking legs this thing is in...

35:21.232 --> 35:24.361
but half of me was tempted to grab
them all and make a break for it.

35:24.444 --> 35:28.282
I mean, I don't know if this
thing's gonna melt or what.

35:29.449 --> 35:31.618
I mean, I was dying.

35:35.164 --> 35:37.500
I had to improvise a little.

35:42.213 --> 35:44.507
- I-I saw something in the fire.
- We're just burning stuff.

35:44.591 --> 35:48.804
No. Look, look.
I saw something in the--

35:48.887 --> 35:52.224
Piano. In the piano,
I saw a-- Look.

35:52.307 --> 35:53.392
- I saw something.
- Jack!

35:54.768 --> 35:56.896
There! There!

35:59.065 --> 36:00.984
What is it?

36:10.619 --> 36:12.287
So everybody's freaking out.

36:12.329 --> 36:14.415
Nobody knows what this is
or what to do with it.

36:14.498 --> 36:16.417
They don't see this kind
of excitement down there.

36:16.500 --> 36:18.502
So they call some supervisor.
They get him out of bed.

36:18.586 --> 36:21.005
He comes down,
he takes one look at this thing.

36:21.089 --> 36:24.217
He doesn't know what the hell it is,
but he knows it's worth a lot.

36:24.300 --> 36:27.304
He tells them, until they can
sort it out, put it in the basement.

36:28.096 --> 36:30.223
- And that's what they do.
- Don't worry. Don't worry.

36:30.265 --> 36:32.768
- Don't worry about it.
- I want to see, Danny.

36:32.851 --> 36:35.562
- Can I see?
- No. Come on. Let's go now.

36:35.604 --> 36:38.065
Okay. Bye-bye. Bye.

36:53.540 --> 36:55.167
The basement
in the customshouse...

36:55.250 --> 36:57.545
is the most secure lockup
in eastern Canada.

36:57.628 --> 37:00.047
It was built as a bomb shelter
during the Cold War.

37:00.131 --> 37:03.593
All their important stuff's there--
state's evidence, narcotics...

37:03.676 --> 37:05.428
confiscated weapons.

37:05.470 --> 37:08.264
That scepter is in a safe
somewhere in this room.

37:08.306 --> 37:10.350
But the thing is,
there's no-- there's no cameras.

37:10.433 --> 37:13.103
If there was, I would've seen
an angle on the video monitors.

37:13.186 --> 37:16.857
So if we can put you inside that
room, you can work on it all night.

37:19.026 --> 37:22.572
We'll need pictures of the safe
or a model number from their files.

37:22.655 --> 37:25.992
Then we're gonna need plans--
infrastructure maps...

37:26.075 --> 37:29.245
blueprints, schematics,
anything we can get our hands on.

37:29.329 --> 37:31.206
That's all I got for now,
but give me two days.

37:31.289 --> 37:33.750
We just gotta find a way
to get into that basement.

38:16.213 --> 38:18.340
You gonna let it go, or are we gonna
drive around pissed all night?

38:18.424 --> 38:20.092
Why don't you kiss my ass?

38:44.869 --> 38:48.414
- We're about set up. You ready?
- Hold on.

39:05.224 --> 39:08.019
- Wanna give me a mark?
- Not yet. Not yet.

39:20.908 --> 39:22.618
How you doing?

39:22.701 --> 39:25.162
Stay off the air
until I call.

39:49.146 --> 39:51.524
Three-three, two-six...

39:51.607 --> 39:53.985
two-nine, three-two.

39:54.027 --> 39:59.700
I repeat: 33, 26, 29, 32.

39:59.783 --> 40:03.871
Copy that. Three-three, two-six,
two-nine, three-two.

40:07.917 --> 40:11.671
Make a right.
Proceed east about 20 yards.

40:11.754 --> 40:13.673
You should see
the next opening.

40:22.307 --> 40:24.685
I'm at a wall here,
a cinder block wall...

40:24.768 --> 40:26.562
where you told me
I have to go.

40:26.645 --> 40:28.898
Are you sure about that?
It shows a straight shot on here.

40:28.981 --> 40:31.609
It's not my imagination.
I'm right here in front of it.

40:31.692 --> 40:34.070
You wanna come down here
and see for yourself?

40:35.530 --> 40:38.366
Right. Okay, okay. Hold on.

40:40.702 --> 40:42.621
All right,
just give me a second.

40:45.457 --> 40:48.377
- Can you read me?
- Make a left. Go about 20 feet.

40:48.419 --> 40:50.004
You should run
into a parallel tunnel.

40:50.087 --> 40:52.548
Make a right. You'll be
right back on course.

40:56.261 --> 40:59.055
Take the tunnel
about 150yards due west.

40:59.097 --> 41:01.391
You'll reach a "T" junction.
Tell me when you're there.

41:01.475 --> 41:02.893
About 300yards.

41:02.976 --> 41:05.854
- Came to the end. Made a right.
- Head Northwest.

41:05.896 --> 41:07.690
Northeast.
Check that. Northeast.

41:07.731 --> 41:09.233
One second. Hold on.

41:10.276 --> 41:13.362
- Are you with me?
- Going west. Going west.

41:13.446 --> 41:18.243
- I'm going west. I'm in a circle.
- Make a right. Go 40yards east.

41:18.284 --> 41:22.247
Then make a left turn.
Go about--

41:22.330 --> 41:24.374
Make a right. Head back.

41:24.416 --> 41:26.877
You got maybe 500 yards to go.

41:34.135 --> 41:37.472
Straight ahead 20 feet, and you
should be dead under the room.

41:37.555 --> 41:39.140
The tunnel will keep on going.

41:39.224 --> 41:41.643
But look up.
You should see the access ladder.

41:48.233 --> 41:50.235
I'm at a shaft.
I'm gonna climb up.

42:02.457 --> 42:04.376
What are you doing?

42:05.127 --> 42:06.503
Still climbing.

42:27.484 --> 42:28.402
This looks like it.

44:02.462 --> 44:04.380
I'm done.

44:16.352 --> 44:18.270
What the hell is this?

44:24.068 --> 44:26.237
Hey, you got a utility crew
all over the entrance.

44:26.321 --> 44:28.239
You're gonna have to find
another way out.

45:02.526 --> 45:04.654
Where are you?

45:11.620 --> 45:13.997
I'm at De La Montagne
and Ottawa.

45:14.081 --> 45:16.083
Repeat:
De La Montagne and Ottawa.

45:16.124 --> 45:18.085
Got it. We're on our way.

45:24.926 --> 45:26.844
This should be it,
right here.

45:28.096 --> 45:30.974
We're here.
I'm just trying to find you.

45:31.057 --> 45:33.476
There. He's right over there.

45:55.834 --> 45:57.628
Okay, you're all clear.

45:57.669 --> 45:59.630
I'm coming out.

46:44.011 --> 46:45.429
Hello.

46:47.056 --> 46:49.016
Anybody home?

47:08.079 --> 47:10.331
- Champagne.
- Yeah.

47:10.414 --> 47:12.583
- Nice touch.
- Nice dress.

47:12.667 --> 47:14.502
You like? Thank you.

47:16.838 --> 47:21.510
So, you asked me a question
a couple of days ago.

47:21.593 --> 47:24.054
And you gave it
some serious thought?

47:25.014 --> 47:26.932
Actually,
I forgot the question.

47:29.393 --> 47:31.896
Here's my answer.

47:31.979 --> 47:33.481
You're not holding up
your glass.

47:33.564 --> 47:34.899
I'm sorry.

47:37.193 --> 47:39.905
My father was a lawyer--
very smart man--

47:39.988 --> 47:43.325
and he would always say
that a deal is only good...

47:43.408 --> 47:47.246
if it leaves both parties feeling
as if they gave up something.

47:47.288 --> 47:50.499
Is an answer coming soon?
'Cause the glass is getting heavy.

47:52.585 --> 47:54.003
Okay.

47:55.171 --> 47:57.298
I will change my life...

47:57.382 --> 47:59.301
I will move here...

48:01.136 --> 48:02.471
I will love you...

48:04.139 --> 48:08.269
and believe that this is
the best decision that I've made.

48:10.020 --> 48:13.065
But I will not move here
if it means that one day...

48:13.149 --> 48:14.859
I might have to talk
to you through glass.

48:14.942 --> 48:17.362
I won't move here if it means
spending my nights worrying.

48:17.445 --> 48:22.993
So if you can promise me, as of
right now, that you're through...

48:24.244 --> 48:27.289
then we can drink
to making changes.

48:35.673 --> 48:38.635
I-- I said you could drink now.

48:38.676 --> 48:39.761
I know.

48:39.844 --> 48:42.389
I wanna do all that.

48:44.015 --> 48:48.312
I just have to tell you
that I'm gonna do one more thing...

48:48.353 --> 48:50.481
- and that's it.
- Oh, fuck.

48:50.522 --> 48:53.025
Everything you said is great.
It's perfect.

48:53.067 --> 48:56.362
I just have one more thing
I have to do.

48:56.446 --> 48:59.115
You put that out there when you
knew you couldn't follow through.

48:59.199 --> 49:02.035
I put it out there because--
I am following through.

49:02.077 --> 49:04.037
- This is my last one. I promise.
- Sure it is.

49:04.120 --> 49:06.164
I promise you
it is my last one.

49:06.206 --> 49:08.876
Then quit. Quit now.

49:08.959 --> 49:12.046
- What does "one last one" mean?
- It means we don't need anything.

49:12.129 --> 49:16.008
I didn't need anything before,
and I don't need anything now...

49:16.050 --> 49:18.302
but what I wanted
was to be with you.

49:18.386 --> 49:21.931
And what I didn't need was exactly
this kind of painful bullshit.

49:22.015 --> 49:26.561
My life wasn't perfect before,
but at least we were clear.

49:29.314 --> 49:30.315
Give me some--

49:32.610 --> 49:34.570
I'll see you when I see you.

50:45.647 --> 50:47.941
Hey, what are you doing?

50:48.024 --> 50:50.777
Somebody put fingerprints
on my window, Danny.

50:50.861 --> 50:54.114
- You don't need to do it.
- I like a clean window, Danny.

50:54.198 --> 50:55.407
It's all right.

50:55.491 --> 50:58.661
We missed you last night.
You feeling better?

50:58.744 --> 51:00.204
- Yes, thank you.
- Sure?

51:00.288 --> 51:01.497
Yes, I'm okay.
Thank you, Danny.

51:01.581 --> 51:05.210
- Take your time. Okay, bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

51:05.293 --> 51:06.377
Bye.

51:23.438 --> 51:25.356
That's your safe.

51:30.570 --> 51:33.657
Traeger standing jeweler's safe,
this year's model.

51:33.740 --> 51:36.994
If it's new, it's gonna be tough
to get the schematics.

51:37.077 --> 51:39.079
I've got all
this year's books.

51:39.121 --> 51:41.540
- Really?
- Yeah. What else?

51:41.624 --> 51:44.877
Okay, the system's
Ironclad Security.

51:44.961 --> 51:46.588
They're a big commercial
industrial outfit.

51:46.629 --> 51:48.965
They handle a lot
of the government buildings here.

51:49.007 --> 51:52.135
Now, this building's pretty old.
The lines are all over the place.

51:52.219 --> 51:55.222
They're easy to find. I can cut in
three or four different places...

51:55.305 --> 51:59.018
and let you in from there, but I
need the engineering pass codes.

51:59.101 --> 52:00.644
I've been looking.
They don't keep them in here.

52:00.728 --> 52:04.065
They'll be at Ironclad.
I don't know what to do.

52:04.148 --> 52:05.441
Okay.

52:07.110 --> 52:09.028
What, are you
calling someone now?

52:13.283 --> 52:16.078
- What? Who is this?
- It's me. Turn down the music.

52:18.831 --> 52:21.083
Hey, Nick, I am fucked up.

52:21.167 --> 52:23.502
My mother's totally
out of control.

52:23.586 --> 52:25.213
Listen. Listen carefully.

52:25.296 --> 52:26.964
Ironclad Security.

52:27.048 --> 52:29.092
- Big outfit.
- Yeah.

52:29.175 --> 52:31.678
I need engineering pass codes
for the customshouse.

52:31.761 --> 52:33.805
I don't know, man.
my concentration's shot.

52:33.847 --> 52:37.142
I haven't slept in, like, a month.
Wait. What customshouse?

52:37.851 --> 52:38.977
Montreal.

52:41.188 --> 52:42.898
You're not pissing
in our own pool, man.

52:42.982 --> 52:45.568
You have always said you were never
gonna do a job here in Montreal.

52:45.651 --> 52:48.321
- I know. I know. Can you do it?
- Steven!

52:48.363 --> 52:50.198
Who are you talking to
at this hour?

52:50.240 --> 52:54.411
I am having a fucking conversation
with a friend of mine, Mother!

52:55.203 --> 52:58.707
- Are you-- Are you okay?
- She is a ghoul.

52:58.790 --> 53:01.210
Now, tell me
exactly what you want.

53:01.293 --> 53:05.256
Just one second. Here's someone
who can tell you what we need.

53:05.339 --> 53:07.717
Just tell him what you need.

53:07.800 --> 53:11.054
I need separate disarm and reset
master codes for the whole system...

53:11.095 --> 53:13.473
and I need the individual
sector bypass codes...

53:13.556 --> 53:17.144
so I can shut down one zone without
lighting off the whole board.

53:17.227 --> 53:19.271
- Okay?
- Yes.

53:21.065 --> 53:22.524
- You got that?
- Got it.

53:22.608 --> 53:25.194
Now, listen, I'm gonna
need this within 48 hours.

53:25.236 --> 53:27.071
If you do that,
I'll double your last price.

53:28.030 --> 53:30.742
Dude, give me a Kaypro 64
and a live dial tone...

53:30.825 --> 53:33.077
and I can do anything.

53:35.038 --> 53:37.958
Oh, now you are going to die.

53:39.376 --> 53:41.879
This is someone
you work with?

53:41.920 --> 53:44.173
And you're giving me
a hard time.

54:15.123 --> 54:18.585
Thursday, 8:07a.m.

54:18.668 --> 54:21.630
Hi. I got your message.
One of the stewardesses is sick...

54:21.713 --> 54:24.842
so I have to cover for her
on a New York run.

54:24.925 --> 54:27.762
We have to talk when I come
through in a couple of days.

54:27.803 --> 54:29.764
Okay?Bye.

54:30.973 --> 54:32.892
End of messages.

54:42.903 --> 54:45.572
Just lock it.

54:45.656 --> 54:49.076
- You work here?
- No. Here.

54:57.085 --> 54:59.129
Come on.

54:59.212 --> 55:01.173
Come on.
Come on in.

55:16.940 --> 55:18.858
Want some coffee?

55:24.406 --> 55:28.077
Jeez. Is this
what we're dealing with?

55:32.456 --> 55:34.333
Page 720.

55:38.797 --> 55:43.844
- Where can I get one of these?
- You gotta know the right people.

55:43.927 --> 55:46.805
Traeger floor safe.
Here it is.

55:47.598 --> 55:50.518
Solid steel body.

55:50.601 --> 55:52.978
Filled door
with aluminum and cobalt.

55:53.896 --> 55:56.941
Half-inch hard plate.
Double dial.

55:58.776 --> 56:00.945
You're gonna need two,
three hours to drill through that.

56:01.029 --> 56:03.824
- You can't drill this.
- Why not?

56:03.907 --> 56:07.202
'Cause this is a newer model
and it's got these glass packs.

56:07.286 --> 56:10.581
See the glass pack here? See?

56:10.664 --> 56:13.834
Drill through that, the glass breaks
and those bolts spring into place.

56:13.918 --> 56:15.670
You're fucked. They're locked.
Forget it.

56:15.711 --> 56:18.006
You can't break it
with a bulldozer.

56:18.047 --> 56:20.675
I've never seen anything like that.
What do you have in mind?

56:20.758 --> 56:23.803
I don't know, but if somebody
built it, somebody can unbuild it.

56:34.857 --> 56:37.860
Yeah, see, when I shut this down,
you'll see this light go off...

56:37.902 --> 56:40.446
but up in the booth,
nothing will register.

56:43.783 --> 56:46.411
- Is that your box?
- That's it.

56:46.495 --> 56:48.497
That's a fucking monster.
That's three times the size of this.

56:48.580 --> 56:50.165
Even bigger than that.

56:50.207 --> 56:53.502
See that over there?

56:53.544 --> 56:56.547
You can see it better over here.

56:56.631 --> 56:59.675
That's an active infrared post.

56:59.717 --> 57:01.803
I don't know.
That wasn't on the system specs.

57:01.886 --> 57:05.307
That's gotta be some independent
loop they set up just in the cage.

57:06.266 --> 57:08.226
I'll take care of it.

57:14.275 --> 57:19.322
All right, just calm down, okay?
I'll be over in a few minutes.

57:20.323 --> 57:22.742
I gotta take care of something.
I'll drop you off.

57:47.894 --> 57:50.105
My mom's only out
for about a half an hour.

57:55.361 --> 57:58.823
I was cruising around Ironclad's
server at the root COBOL level...

57:58.906 --> 58:03.828
when someone counter-cracked me,
hacked into my machines, my data.

58:03.911 --> 58:05.747
For three minutes,
I was fully exposed.

58:05.830 --> 58:10.168
Now I have to fire wall my whole
operations all from scratch.

58:10.252 --> 58:13.797
- Can you tell me that in English?
- Sorry.

58:13.881 --> 58:16.759
I was a few keystrokes away from
pulling those engineering codes...

58:16.842 --> 58:18.969
when I bump into a guy
on the other end.

58:19.053 --> 58:21.889
- And what's on the other end?
- Ironclad's computers.

58:21.931 --> 58:24.100
My guess is he's some
low-level systems administrator.

58:24.183 --> 58:29.314
So, we switch to a private
chat room, and he sends me this.

58:31.233 --> 58:32.150
Can you believe that?

58:32.234 --> 58:35.404
The guy comes into my world
and calls me an asshole.

58:35.446 --> 58:38.532
- Can you get me the bypass codes?
- I type, " How much?" He types...

58:38.616 --> 58:40.409
" Engineering codes for
the customshouse basement?"

58:40.493 --> 58:42.578
I say, "You guessed it,
Blue's Clues."

58:42.620 --> 58:44.706
And he says, " Fuck you."
And I say, " No, fuck you."

58:44.789 --> 58:47.458
And he says, " No, fuck you."
I'm like, " No, fuck you."

58:47.542 --> 58:49.461
Then he's like, " No, fuck--"

58:49.502 --> 58:52.047
Can you get me the bypass codes?

58:53.298 --> 58:57.094
The guy wants 50 thou
in exchange for the codes.

58:57.177 --> 59:00.097
- Fifty thousand.
- Yes.

59:02.767 --> 59:04.185
Get the account number.

59:04.268 --> 59:06.354
I'll wire the money, and he'll
deliver the codes through you.

59:06.437 --> 59:07.939
Negative.
The guy won't go for a transfer.

59:08.022 --> 59:10.442
He wants cash
and he wants to do it in person.

59:11.776 --> 59:13.487
- Anything else?
- No.

59:13.570 --> 59:16.532
You set it up.
I'll let myself out.

59:16.615 --> 59:19.660
When this score's done, I'm gonna
brute this creep with everything.

59:19.743 --> 59:23.372
By the time I'm done with this fuck,
he won't be able to hide in Bolivia!

59:52.028 --> 59:55.157
Jesus.
Look at all these people.

59:55.198 --> 59:58.118
Who sets up a meeting
in a public park?

01:00:02.206 --> 01:00:05.001
- You see him?
- Still looking.

01:00:20.017 --> 01:00:23.437
Got him.
He brought backup.

01:00:25.064 --> 01:00:27.066
Okay, I got him.

01:00:39.913 --> 01:00:42.708
Hey, how ya doing?
Good to see ya.

01:00:42.750 --> 01:00:45.836
Shake my hand. That's right.
You my guy?

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:47.129
Yeah.

01:00:47.213 --> 01:00:50.341
- Who's this?
- Cousin.

01:00:50.425 --> 01:00:54.053
Cousin? Okay. See the guy
over my left shoulder...

01:00:54.095 --> 01:00:59.309
back there on the bench,
reading the paper, the big one?

01:00:59.393 --> 01:01:02.938
That's my cousin, okay?

01:01:03.021 --> 01:01:07.068
So we've all got family here,
which is nice, I think. Yeah? Okay.

01:01:07.109 --> 01:01:11.614
Let me give you that. Look inside
and make sure you're happy.

01:01:16.286 --> 01:01:17.579
No, don't take that out.

01:01:17.662 --> 01:01:20.749
Hey, man, don't give me orders.
I get orders all day, okay?

01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:22.918
Can't count the money
in a public place.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:25.254
That's why you don't
set a meeting in a park.

01:01:25.337 --> 01:01:27.173
Just for future reference.

01:01:28.299 --> 01:01:30.426
Just flip through it in the bag.

01:01:31.969 --> 01:01:34.222
We're about set to go here.
You ready?

01:01:34.305 --> 01:01:35.473
What the fuck is that?

01:01:35.557 --> 01:01:38.435
He's gonna give me the numbers, and
I'm gonna read 'em into this mike...

01:01:38.476 --> 01:01:40.479
to a friend of mine
who's gonna check 'em out.

01:01:43.982 --> 01:01:46.277
Did you think I was gonna
write it down on a cocktail napkin?

01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:50.114
- Okay, ready.
- Okay, you're on.

01:01:51.949 --> 01:01:55.620
First set: 3-1-7.

01:01:55.703 --> 01:01:58.790
- 3-1-7.
- Got it. 3-1-7.

01:01:58.832 --> 01:02:03.128
Steven, 3-1-7.

01:02:03.211 --> 01:02:05.756
Confirm 3-1-7.

01:02:10.845 --> 01:02:15.600
Just be a second.
Are you guys maternal cousins?

01:02:29.615 --> 01:02:32.410
- First numbers are clean.
- They're clean. They're clean.

01:02:32.493 --> 01:02:34.745
You tell the hack
at the other end of that wire...

01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:37.624
he tries to get in my system again,
I will fry him, okay?

01:02:37.707 --> 01:02:39.542
Why don't we worry about
next time next time, okay?

01:02:39.626 --> 01:02:41.670
Let's get this done before
people start looking at us.

01:02:41.711 --> 01:02:44.840
- Give me the second set.
- 9-4-6.

01:02:44.923 --> 01:02:47.843
- 9-4-6.
- 9-4-6.

01:02:47.885 --> 01:02:51.972
Repeat: 9-4-6. 9-4-6.

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:01.691
- Take it easy. Relax. Have a smoke.
- I don't smoke.

01:03:01.733 --> 01:03:05.821
Me either, so good for us.
You guys local? You live here?

01:03:05.904 --> 01:03:08.615
Why are you asking
so many fucking questions?

01:03:13.954 --> 01:03:17.208
- They're good.
- Second set is good.

01:03:17.291 --> 01:03:18.793
What's the third one?

01:03:21.129 --> 01:03:23.089
5-8-3-9.

01:03:23.131 --> 01:03:25.342
5-8-3-9.

01:03:25.425 --> 01:03:27.886
5-8-3-9. Got it.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:31.473
5-8-3-9.

01:03:40.942 --> 01:03:43.236
This is taking too long.
I'm gonna fucking lose it.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:45.113
Shut up, Eric.

01:03:45.197 --> 01:03:48.367
They have to verify the numbers
off the server. It takes some time.

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:49.952
Just relax, Eric.

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:55.416
Can you help me out? It's turning
into amateur hour out here.

01:03:55.458 --> 01:03:58.169
- Fuck you, asshole.
- What are you doing?

01:03:58.252 --> 01:03:59.754
One of them has a gun.

01:03:59.837 --> 01:04:01.923
Burt, big guy's got a gun.

01:04:02.006 --> 01:04:03.758
Steven, how's it going?
We're losing these guys.

01:04:03.842 --> 01:04:06.761
- I'm working it, man.
- Steven, want some lunch?

01:04:06.803 --> 01:04:09.181
I'm on the phone, bitch!

01:04:09.264 --> 01:04:10.432
- You all right?
- We're fine.

01:04:10.516 --> 01:04:15.354
Don't anybody move.
Eric, look at my hand right now.

01:04:17.189 --> 01:04:21.027
If you take that out, I'm gonna take
this out, be a big fucking mess.

01:04:21.986 --> 01:04:23.613
Put it away, Eric.

01:04:23.655 --> 01:04:25.782
There's kids all around.
What are you thinking?

01:04:25.865 --> 01:04:30.746
Put it away. Take a deep breath
and just put it in your back pocket.

01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:33.040
Put it away.

01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:39.213
- They're all good.
- Last set of numbers confirmed.

01:04:39.297 --> 01:04:41.299
Last set of numbers confirmed.
Let's get out of here.

01:04:51.894 --> 01:04:53.353
Next time, don't bring a gun.

01:04:53.395 --> 01:04:57.107
Listen, I thought
I might need one, and I did.

01:04:57.191 --> 01:04:59.318
- Now we've got the codes.
- Don't bring a gun.

01:05:08.411 --> 01:05:11.623
I called. They said you hadn't
checked in yet. No.

01:05:16.754 --> 01:05:19.090
So what time you getting in?

01:05:21.467 --> 01:05:23.761
Come on, honey.
Don't stay at a hotel.

01:05:23.845 --> 01:05:26.389
Just come over to my place.
I'll cook some--

01:05:38.319 --> 01:05:39.904
Yeah. Yeah.

01:05:39.987 --> 01:05:42.406
I was just saying come to my place.
I'll cook something.

01:05:42.448 --> 01:05:44.492
You know, we'll talk, okay?

01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:51.374
I'm thinking 'bout a place

01:05:51.458 --> 01:05:54.127
I'm waiting for the day

01:05:54.211 --> 01:05:58.632
When I will make my getaway

01:05:59.758 --> 01:06:02.887
Because as any fool can see

01:06:02.970 --> 01:06:05.431
There's nothing here for me

01:06:05.515 --> 01:06:09.227
But hurry up, boy
bring that water

01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:11.730
Don't do things
you shouldn't oughta

01:06:11.813 --> 01:06:13.690
He's good.

01:06:15.484 --> 01:06:18.320
When you gotta be there?

01:06:18.404 --> 01:06:22.450
I'll go in in a couple hours.
I'm okay. I'm doing fine.

01:06:23.826 --> 01:06:26.662
Listen, tell me something.
Tell me something.

01:06:26.704 --> 01:06:28.957
All the years
you've been doing this...

01:06:28.998 --> 01:06:31.376
what's the biggest gamble
you ever took?

01:06:31.459 --> 01:06:35.130
On the job.
You know, biggest long shot.

01:06:35.213 --> 01:06:37.424
I don't take long shots.

01:06:37.508 --> 01:06:40.010
I know you're careful.
You know, I'm careful too.

01:06:40.094 --> 01:06:42.680
That's not what I mean.
I mean--

01:06:42.763 --> 01:06:45.308
When you were starting out,
when you were just getting going...

01:06:45.349 --> 01:06:48.227
you must have taken
some fliers here and there.

01:06:48.311 --> 01:06:50.396
Done something that was
a little wild. I'm just curious.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:52.315
Never took long shots.

01:06:56.153 --> 01:06:57.738
I'm gonna say something to you.

01:06:57.821 --> 01:06:59.907
You're smart, you're talented
and you know a few things...

01:06:59.990 --> 01:07:03.160
but talent means nothing
if you don't make the right choices.

01:07:03.244 --> 01:07:06.664
There's talented people out there
who never see daylight anymore.

01:07:06.706 --> 01:07:08.958
Last thing, it takes discipline...

01:07:09.042 --> 01:07:11.002
because this whole game
is one big long shot...

01:07:11.085 --> 01:07:13.338
and if you don't have the discipline
to stay away from the fliers...

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.383
or from the gambles or whatever else
you wanna call a stupid move...

01:07:16.466 --> 01:07:19.720
then, my friend, I'm afraid to say,
one day you will go down.

01:07:19.803 --> 01:07:21.305
It's inevitable.

01:07:22.097 --> 01:07:24.391
You want my advice?

01:07:24.558 --> 01:07:26.435
Make a list of everything
you want now...

01:07:26.519 --> 01:07:29.731
and plan on spending the next
25 years of your life getting it.

01:07:29.814 --> 01:07:32.692
Slowly, piece by piece.

01:07:40.117 --> 01:07:41.618
I see what you're saying.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:47.583
But still, I'm looking at you,
and you got all this already...

01:07:47.625 --> 01:07:50.253
and you're sitting here with me,
working with a partner...

01:07:50.336 --> 01:07:53.381
in the city where you live, on a job
that's gotten more complicated...

01:07:53.465 --> 01:07:55.926
than you thought it was gonna be.

01:07:55.967 --> 01:07:58.470
So I know you're still
taking a shot at something.

01:08:04.393 --> 01:08:06.604
I gotta go.

01:08:08.397 --> 01:08:10.608
See ya tomorrow.

01:08:17.823 --> 01:08:19.826
The maintenance crews
come in the tunnels by 6a.m.

01:08:19.868 --> 01:08:21.828
I gotta be back in the hole by 5:30.

01:08:21.912 --> 01:08:24.288
As soon as the guards leave,
you gotta tell me right away.

01:08:24.331 --> 01:08:26.584
- You can't be late.
- I'm not worried about my end.

01:08:26.667 --> 01:08:31.631
I'm wondering how you're gonna
break that safe in half an hour.

01:08:31.714 --> 01:08:33.466
You know, I mean--

01:08:52.361 --> 01:08:55.740
- Is that even possible?
- Just physics.

01:09:00.203 --> 01:09:03.206
- How long is that gonna take?
- Twelve, fifteen minutes, tops.

01:09:03.247 --> 01:09:05.375
Fifteen minutes, tops?

01:09:07.169 --> 01:09:10.214
Okay. Okay.

01:09:10.296 --> 01:09:14.469
Then if you're on the box by 5:00,
the prize goes in the bag by 5: 1 5.

01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:17.846
- You got no problem at all.
- 5: 1 5, 5:30, I'm back in the hole.

01:09:17.889 --> 01:09:21.184
- You reset the system.
- That's perfect.

01:09:21.268 --> 01:09:23.353
I'll pack up my shit.
I can meet you here.

01:09:23.437 --> 01:09:26.689
- We can go to Max, or I can--
- We're not gonna meet back here.

01:09:26.774 --> 01:09:29.359
- I'll meet you at Max's, then.
- No.

01:09:29.443 --> 01:09:32.488
You'll finish out your shift.
I go to Max. He does his thing.

01:09:32.572 --> 01:09:34.365
He pays us off.
We never see each other again.

01:09:34.448 --> 01:09:37.452
Forget it. Just forget it.
I'm gonna come with you to Max's.

01:09:37.535 --> 01:09:40.162
- We'll deliver it together.
- No, you're not.

01:09:40.246 --> 01:09:43.207
Listen. I've done this
down to the last detail.

01:09:43.291 --> 01:09:45.752
Don't put me on the sideline
when it's time to collect.

01:09:45.836 --> 01:09:48.212
- Don't do it.
- Listen to me.

01:09:48.255 --> 01:09:50.591
You do anything out of the ordinary,
you're gonna get made.

01:09:50.674 --> 01:09:54.679
Do you understand that?
Be smart. Finish out your shift.

01:09:59.434 --> 01:10:01.561
- You're the boss.
- Okay.

01:10:16.619 --> 01:10:19.289
Steven got these from a supplier.
They're throwaways.

01:10:19.372 --> 01:10:21.082
Totally untraceable.

01:10:25.379 --> 01:10:28.841
People are talking. They say Max
is in trouble with Teddy Salida...

01:10:28.924 --> 01:10:31.886
and he's pulling off a big job
to get rid of him.

01:10:33.721 --> 01:10:35.640
That's what they say?

01:10:37.308 --> 01:10:39.894
Maybe you should
walk away from this one.

01:12:07.364 --> 01:12:09.324
What are you doing down here?

01:12:09.366 --> 01:12:12.494
Jesus Christ,
you scared the shit out of me.

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:16.290
What the hell are you
doing down here?

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:19.001
Did you involve
Teddy Salida in this?

01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:22.422
- What? Teddy Salida?
- Yeah.

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:26.009
- Why would you say that?
- I see these guys outside.

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.637
They look like
they might be with him.

01:12:30.222 --> 01:12:32.182
How much you into him for?

01:12:32.766 --> 01:12:34.184
Four million.

01:12:35.853 --> 01:12:37.354
Look, how do you think
I got all this?

01:12:37.438 --> 01:12:39.815
They gave it to me
and the house in Bermuda?

01:12:39.899 --> 01:12:42.193
What's the matter with you?

01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:45.363
What's he know?

01:12:45.446 --> 01:12:48.491
- About what?
- About what we're doing.

01:12:49.534 --> 01:12:52.829
Nothing. I told him I found
something that would go for eight...

01:12:52.871 --> 01:12:56.083
and that we'd
split the profits, that's all.

01:12:57.209 --> 01:12:59.503
What are you actually
selling the scepter for, Max?

01:13:01.922 --> 01:13:04.675
$30 million.

01:13:05.677 --> 01:13:09.264
Jesus.
Max, what were you thinking?

01:13:09.347 --> 01:13:11.266
What was I thinking?
The same thing you were thinking.

01:13:11.349 --> 01:13:16.522
How are we gonna get out from under
all this bullshit we've been living?

01:13:16.563 --> 01:13:19.692
The chance came. Took it.

01:13:19.775 --> 01:13:22.778
- It's gonna work out fine.
- No, it's not.

01:13:22.862 --> 01:13:25.448
- What do you mean, it's not?
- It's not. It's a mess.

01:13:25.531 --> 01:13:29.035
- It's not gonna work.
- Wait. Wait a fucking minute.

01:13:29.119 --> 01:13:33.290
This is absolutely clean, Nick.
What are you worried about?

01:13:33.373 --> 01:13:36.293
Jesus Christ, it's my ass
on the line anyway, not yours.

01:13:36.376 --> 01:13:38.462
I'm not taking
the biggest gamble of my life...

01:13:38.545 --> 01:13:40.548
so I can hand my money over
to Teddy Salida.

01:13:40.589 --> 01:13:43.801
You think you're not gonna get
your fucking money?

01:13:43.884 --> 01:13:45.636
Look, there's two things
you gotta know.

01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:48.890
One is you're gonna get
every fucking red cent.

01:13:48.932 --> 01:13:52.227
And, yeah,
Teddy knows a little.

01:13:52.268 --> 01:13:54.396
- He knows?
- He does a little, I said.

01:13:54.479 --> 01:13:58.233
- So you did lie?
- Yeah, lied! Shit happens, man!

01:13:58.275 --> 01:14:00.194
Christ Almighty!

01:14:00.277 --> 01:14:02.279
I lied for you and I lied for me.

01:14:02.363 --> 01:14:05.867
I had to say something
to get you to suit up, like always.

01:14:10.580 --> 01:14:12.457
I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna do it.

01:14:14.626 --> 01:14:17.754
It's a tiny door. Open the door.
Take the shit.

01:14:17.838 --> 01:14:19.798
Close the door. We're out.

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.426
There's too much bullshit
around it.

01:14:39.361 --> 01:14:41.155
What's that?

01:14:53.334 --> 01:14:55.170
The buyer.

01:14:56.796 --> 01:14:59.675
Real simple. You call him
when you get the scepter.

01:15:00.384 --> 01:15:03.304
He'll meet you at the airstrip
30 miles up the St. Lawrence.

01:15:03.345 --> 01:15:07.141
There's a little town called
St. Croix.

01:15:08.684 --> 01:15:11.354
You give him the scepter,
he gives you the cash.

01:15:11.437 --> 01:15:14.858
You take your cut
and you wire me the rest.

01:15:14.899 --> 01:15:18.487
I'll give Teddy his,
and you're clean.

01:15:22.866 --> 01:15:25.411
It's too risky.

01:15:25.494 --> 01:15:27.455
Can't.

01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:33.503
You don't know
what you're doing.

01:15:33.544 --> 01:15:36.297
You know how long we go back?

01:15:38.383 --> 01:15:39.885
Twenty-five years.

01:15:42.346 --> 01:15:45.349
I'm gonna tell you something.

01:15:45.432 --> 01:15:49.562
For the first time in my life,
I'm scared.

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:52.106
I don't know why it is.
I was never scared before...

01:15:52.190 --> 01:15:54.984
but I'm scared now, Nick.

01:15:55.068 --> 01:15:59.197
And you're right about Teddy.
He's gonna blow me away if he can.

01:15:59.281 --> 01:16:01.366
If I don't get him his money, he--

01:16:02.409 --> 01:16:04.787
Man, he--

01:16:07.373 --> 01:16:11.919
Hey, don't-don't-don't-don't
let me slide on this one.

01:16:12.003 --> 01:16:14.339
I can't afford it, man.

01:16:20.095 --> 01:16:23.765
I can't--
I can't scrap it out anymore.

01:16:23.849 --> 01:16:26.268
I gotta have some slack.

01:16:31.482 --> 01:16:33.484
All right. Okay.

01:16:35.778 --> 01:16:37.906
I hope you're not fucking me up.

01:16:54.382 --> 01:16:56.426
I'm going down to check the power.

01:17:03.975 --> 01:17:07.771
- How much more equipment you got?
- Here you go.

01:17:12.568 --> 01:17:14.278
- Sorry! Sorry! Sorry!
- It's okay, Brian.

01:17:14.362 --> 01:17:16.614
- Come on in.
- It's my radio.

01:17:16.697 --> 01:17:18.866
- Hey, what's all the commotion?
- Don't worry, Danny.

01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:21.077
- They're beefing things up.
- What for?

01:17:21.161 --> 01:17:23.788
- A few cameras in the basement.
- Like we're gonna lose it, right?

01:17:23.830 --> 01:17:26.249
- Lose what?
- That thing in the piano leg.

01:17:26.333 --> 01:17:30.254
- The big gold thing?
- Some French national treasure.

01:17:30.337 --> 01:17:34.425
- It's called a scepter.
- Some expert saw those pictures.

01:17:34.508 --> 01:17:38.012
Now we're getting calls
from the central office.

01:17:41.474 --> 01:17:44.811
Hey, it's me.
Yeah, we got a problem.

01:17:44.853 --> 01:17:48.732
They got a camera over
the main door here, covering that.

01:17:48.815 --> 01:17:51.986
They got a camera here,
looking right across the middle.

01:17:52.027 --> 01:17:55.114
They got one special
just on the box...

01:17:55.197 --> 01:17:57.492
sees this entire cage.

01:17:58.868 --> 01:18:00.995
This camera looking at the box...

01:18:01.037 --> 01:18:03.790
how high is it from the floor
and how low is it from the ceiling?

01:18:03.873 --> 01:18:07.502
Probably 1 0, 1 2 feet up
off the floor.

01:18:07.586 --> 01:18:11.048
Four feet down from the ceiling.
I think we're fucked.

01:18:13.384 --> 01:18:16.053
So let me--

01:18:16.137 --> 01:18:18.473
When I'm here...

01:18:18.556 --> 01:18:21.517
you'll cut the feed when I get
across here, then you'll restore it.

01:18:21.559 --> 01:18:23.645
Then when I'm ready here,
you'll cut it again...

01:18:23.728 --> 01:18:26.022
and I'll go to work here.

01:18:27.107 --> 01:18:28.984
I don't know about that, man.

01:18:29.067 --> 01:18:31.361
They know what it is so now they're
gonna move it as soon as they can.

01:18:31.403 --> 01:18:35.991
We're not gonna get another chance.
We gotta go now or we don't go at all.

01:20:03.669 --> 01:20:05.672
Hi, Doug. Hi.

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.017
- Hi, Henri.
- Hi, Brian.

01:20:20.855 --> 01:20:23.649
- Okay. Thank you.
- No problem.

01:20:23.733 --> 01:20:26.361
- Hi, Danny.
- Hello, Brian.

01:20:26.444 --> 01:20:30.949
Oh, look at you.
What fancy new shoes.

01:20:31.032 --> 01:20:33.785
Yeah. Yeah, my mom
got those for me.

01:20:33.869 --> 01:20:38.374
- Oh, your mom gave you those?
- I think you got a girl.

01:20:38.415 --> 01:20:40.918
No girl, Danny.
You're a stinker.

01:20:41.585 --> 01:20:44.755
Well, you and your new shoes can
give me a hand up on six tonight.

01:20:44.839 --> 01:20:47.925
We're gonna wax
the whole cafeteria floor.

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:50.053
You hit the garbage.
I'll get the stuff.

01:20:50.094 --> 01:20:52.639
I'll meet you there,
what, 1 5 minutes.

01:20:52.722 --> 01:20:54.683
Fifteen. Okay.

01:20:54.766 --> 01:21:00.397
Okay, I'll get the garbage, Danny.
Okay? Bye-bye, Andre.

01:21:00.481 --> 01:21:02.233
Bye-bye.
You look good with those shoes.

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:04.986
Yeah, thanks. I know.

01:21:27.885 --> 01:21:29.846
Watch your step out there, Brian.

01:21:29.929 --> 01:21:31.890
I will. Thank you.

01:25:41.576 --> 01:25:44.245
Okay. Okay, Danny.

01:25:44.329 --> 01:25:47.457
- Guess what time it is.
- I don't know.

01:25:47.541 --> 01:25:49.835
Yes, you do, Danny!
It's lunchtime!

01:25:49.918 --> 01:25:52.045
All right, I'll tell you what.

01:25:52.129 --> 01:25:54.965
What do you say we keep on working,
finish the other side, hmm?

01:25:55.049 --> 01:25:57.510
No, Danny. Why?

01:25:57.593 --> 01:26:00.805
Then we can blow off the rest of
the day and grab some pancakes.

01:26:00.888 --> 01:26:03.975
It won't take us long. Just throw
a little extra thinner into the mix.

01:26:04.058 --> 01:26:07.103
It'll go like butter.

01:26:54.863 --> 01:26:56.740
Danny, I am sorry.

01:26:56.824 --> 01:26:58.993
It's okay. Just leave it.
I'll mop it up.

01:26:59.034 --> 01:27:01.162
- I'll go get some more.
- You don't need to--

01:27:01.245 --> 01:27:03.873
- I will get some more.
- All right.

01:27:03.956 --> 01:27:06.042
- You know where? Ground floor?
- Okay.

01:27:06.125 --> 01:27:08.169
You know the closet?

01:27:12.382 --> 01:27:14.718
Set to go. Set to go.

01:27:30.527 --> 01:27:32.070
Fuck.

01:27:36.116 --> 01:27:39.119
Are you there?
I'm on my mark.

01:27:46.711 --> 01:27:49.047
- I'm on. Are you there?
- I'm here. We're running late.

01:27:49.130 --> 01:27:50.590
I know. I hit a snag.

01:27:52.592 --> 01:27:55.554
I'm already all set up, though.
Just give me one second.

01:28:01.769 --> 01:28:05.314
All right, I just gotta punch in
these codes. Just sit tight.

01:28:25.503 --> 01:28:26.796
I got it.

01:28:26.879 --> 01:28:29.257
Hang on one more beat.

01:28:39.601 --> 01:28:41.395
It's clear.
Get in there.

01:29:08.549 --> 01:29:12.470
I'm inside the first cage.
Repeat: I am inside the first cage.

01:29:20.228 --> 01:29:21.688
You're all clear.

01:30:35.268 --> 01:30:39.022
- I'm set. Kill it.
- All right, on my mark.

01:30:50.951 --> 01:30:52.119
Go.

01:30:56.499 --> 01:30:57.625
I'm here.

01:30:59.419 --> 01:31:01.338
There we go.

01:31:01.421 --> 01:31:03.799
Perfect. Tell me when
you're in second position.

01:33:44.931 --> 01:33:46.808
Fuck.

01:34:30.522 --> 01:34:33.191
- How ya doing down there?
- Almost there.

01:34:50.668 --> 01:34:52.671
Do you know where is Brian?

01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:55.632
No idea.

01:35:54.863 --> 01:35:55.655
I'm ready.

01:35:56.406 --> 01:35:59.701
I need a second here.
Hold on.

01:36:00.285 --> 01:36:02.746
I'm all set. Cut the cameras.
Repeat:

01:36:02.830 --> 01:36:05.082
I'm all set.
Cut the cameras.

01:36:08.419 --> 01:36:10.546
Gotta go. Got to go.

01:36:13.842 --> 01:36:15.927
What's up? What's up?

01:36:17.137 --> 01:36:19.932
I got company.
I got company.

01:36:21.892 --> 01:36:23.894
Hang on one second.

01:36:23.978 --> 01:36:25.729
Just sit tight.
I'll be right back.

01:36:57.847 --> 01:36:59.683
Okay.

01:37:16.576 --> 01:37:18.578
Jack, where are you?

01:37:23.041 --> 01:37:25.502
Jack, come in.Jack.

01:37:41.186 --> 01:37:43.689
Jack, are you there?

01:38:04.628 --> 01:38:06.630
I'm pulling out.
Repeat: I'm pulling out.

01:38:06.672 --> 01:38:08.632
- I'm back. I'm back.
- It's too late.

01:38:08.674 --> 01:38:10.968
- I'm pulling out.
- No, it's not. We're good.

01:38:11.051 --> 01:38:12.720
Get ready to go.

01:38:14.388 --> 01:38:15.848
On my mark.

01:38:20.061 --> 01:38:21.187
Go, go, go.

01:38:35.661 --> 01:38:37.622
What the hell's wrong
with these machines?

01:38:50.260 --> 01:38:53.264
Hey, stop banging on it.
Check the connection.

01:39:14.578 --> 01:39:17.915
- You see something?
- I don't know.

01:39:36.769 --> 01:39:39.188
Call them.
Call Ironclad.

01:39:39.939 --> 01:39:43.026
- And look like idiots?
- I don't care. Call them.

01:40:38.627 --> 01:40:41.339
Maybe it's some of the equipment
down in the basement.

01:40:43.675 --> 01:40:45.677
Okay. Thanks.

01:40:47.387 --> 01:40:50.015
Someone will be here
in a few minutes.

01:41:36.482 --> 01:41:38.567
Where are you, kid?

01:43:24.807 --> 01:43:27.810
Make a move, make a sound,
and you are dead.

01:43:27.893 --> 01:43:29.937
Do you understand me?

01:43:31.856 --> 01:43:33.441
Turn around.

01:43:37.988 --> 01:43:39.531
Be quiet.

01:43:53.963 --> 01:43:55.924
I wish you had not
come down here, man.

01:43:59.761 --> 01:44:03.891
Get over there. Turn around.
Come on. Let's go. Turn around.

01:44:03.974 --> 01:44:07.853
Walk over there.
Open the door.

01:44:07.937 --> 01:44:09.981
Open it.

01:44:10.022 --> 01:44:11.941
Get inside.

01:44:14.027 --> 01:44:15.945
Look at me.

01:44:16.029 --> 01:44:18.490
You're a good man.
I don't want to hurt you.

01:44:18.531 --> 01:44:21.451
But if you start making noise or
try to open that door, I will do it.

01:44:21.535 --> 01:44:23.036
Do you understand me?

01:44:25.414 --> 01:44:28.501
Stay in there and be quiet.
Everything will be fine.

01:45:31.902 --> 01:45:33.738
I don't wanna wait.

01:45:33.779 --> 01:45:36.574
I want you and Tommy
to go into the basement now.

01:45:36.616 --> 01:45:38.910
Come on, Andre.
I'm watching this.

01:45:38.993 --> 01:45:40.787
Laurent, please.

01:45:42.789 --> 01:45:46.084
Tommy, get Philippe. We're gonna be
checking out the basement again.

01:46:30.591 --> 01:46:32.426
Hold it right there!

01:46:32.509 --> 01:46:34.720
- Are you crazy?
- Take it off and put it down.

01:46:34.804 --> 01:46:38.766
- Aw, come on.
- Take it off and put it down now!

01:46:38.850 --> 01:46:42.228
- Don't do this.
- Take it off and put it down!

01:46:42.312 --> 01:46:44.272
- Please, don't--
- Don't fucking argue with me.

01:46:44.356 --> 01:46:47.025
Take it off and put it down.

01:46:47.108 --> 01:46:48.735
I can't. I can't.

01:46:50.028 --> 01:46:53.198
I'll put the next one in your knee.
I don't have time to fuck around.

01:46:53.282 --> 01:46:56.577
We can work out the details later.
I am leaving with that scepter.

01:46:57.870 --> 01:47:01.958
Now, take it off
and hand it over right now!

01:47:09.174 --> 01:47:12.761
Put it down. Slowly.

01:47:13.470 --> 01:47:15.764
Now, step back.
Back up.

01:47:24.691 --> 01:47:26.651
- Take off your mask.
- What?

01:47:26.735 --> 01:47:28.236
Take it off!

01:47:29.863 --> 01:47:33.200
I don't have time to play games.
Take it off.

01:47:45.547 --> 01:47:47.465
Throw it over there.

01:47:49.634 --> 01:47:51.803
Step in the middle.

01:47:51.887 --> 01:47:54.223
Step in the middle.
That's right.

01:47:57.893 --> 01:48:01.939
We wouldn't be here if you'd thrown
me some respect at the beginning.

01:48:02.023 --> 01:48:03.983
- Just a little bit.
- This is a stupid move.

01:48:04.067 --> 01:48:05.610
- It is? Why?
- We all come out ahead.

01:48:05.693 --> 01:48:08.154
What are you doing?
Just go up there and finish--

01:48:08.238 --> 01:48:09.781
It's a long shot.
I should play it tight.

01:48:09.864 --> 01:48:11.783
You know what I think
of your bullshit advice?

01:48:11.867 --> 01:48:14.995
I think that's you trying to talk me
into taking a sucker's share...

01:48:15.078 --> 01:48:18.332
on a score that I set up
from the beginning!

01:48:19.834 --> 01:48:23.880
You think I'm stupid, that I don't
see what you and Max are doing?

01:48:25.548 --> 01:48:29.219
I mean, what is he giving you?
Five, six million?

01:48:29.302 --> 01:48:31.721
Tell me that's not true.

01:48:31.805 --> 01:48:34.016
See, that doesn't work for me.

01:48:35.642 --> 01:48:40.481
I appreciate your help,
but you should've made me a partner.

01:48:40.564 --> 01:48:42.608
Now I gotta take a shot.

01:48:48.323 --> 01:48:51.826
Just sit tight. Just sit tight.
Everything will be fine.

01:48:55.831 --> 01:48:59.418
Now you got a choice. You can
either head for that tunnel...

01:48:59.501 --> 01:49:01.378
or smile for that camera.

01:49:09.971 --> 01:49:11.514
Andre, what's happening?

01:49:11.598 --> 01:49:13.225
Get down!
Go to the basement!

01:49:13.308 --> 01:49:15.894
We're being robbed!
We're being robbed!

01:49:20.899 --> 01:49:23.903
Henri, quick! Go outside!
Wait for the police!

01:49:31.453 --> 01:49:33.204
Let's go!
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:50:04.613 --> 01:50:06.699
Over here! Over here!

01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:15.083
- He's in the tunnel!
- Where is he?

01:50:17.461 --> 01:50:18.920
Find him!

01:50:35.814 --> 01:50:37.941
- Back there!
- Okay!

01:50:38.024 --> 01:50:40.027
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:51:24.032 --> 01:51:26.744
- Andre!
- Oh, shit.

01:51:26.827 --> 01:51:28.913
- Andre, is there a fire?
- It's okay.

01:51:32.834 --> 01:51:34.752
- Where's Danny?
- Just get out!

01:51:34.836 --> 01:51:37.213
- Okay.
- Just wait outside.

01:51:40.759 --> 01:51:44.221
- Just wait outside!
- Okay, bye-bye.

01:51:47.349 --> 01:51:49.685
Wait, Brian, wait!

01:51:49.727 --> 01:51:51.520
Get back, Brian!

01:51:54.065 --> 01:51:56.818
It's Brian! It's Brian!

01:51:56.901 --> 01:52:00.697
- Have you seen Brian?
- He's okay! He's outside!

01:52:00.780 --> 01:52:02.991
No! My God, it's him!

01:52:05.077 --> 01:52:07.830
It's okay now.
It's okay.

01:54:39.702 --> 01:54:43.539
Attention. The bus to Albany,
New York leaves in five--

01:54:45.542 --> 01:54:46.543
Yeah?

01:54:46.626 --> 01:54:48.879
- Hey, did you make it?
- Fuck you.

01:54:50.297 --> 01:54:52.257
Come on. I'm just checking
to make sure you got out okay.

01:54:52.299 --> 01:54:54.259
I knew you'd give 'em the slip.

01:54:55.469 --> 01:54:57.429
I'm almost home, too, here,
by the way.

01:54:57.513 --> 01:54:59.306
Oh, you are, huh?
You sure about that?

01:54:59.390 --> 01:55:02.852
Look, whatever you're thinking
about, just forget it, okay?

01:55:02.935 --> 01:55:04.938
This is over now
and you just gotta deal with it.

01:55:04.979 --> 01:55:08.525
It's not over yet 'cause you don't
know where you're going, and I do.

01:55:08.608 --> 01:55:10.527
- You don't know shit!
- You know where you're going?

01:55:10.610 --> 01:55:15.199
I'm five minutes from being gone.
You can't imagine where I'm going.

01:55:15.282 --> 01:55:18.035
- You got nothing.
- You know what I got.

01:55:18.118 --> 01:55:20.246
You just can't deal with the fact
that I beat you.

01:55:20.329 --> 01:55:24.417
Oh, yeah? What have you got?
Huh? What have you got?

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:26.544
You know what I've got.

01:55:55.534 --> 01:55:56.785
Let me ask you something.

01:55:56.869 --> 01:56:00.289
When did you start thinking
you were better than me, huh?

01:56:00.372 --> 01:56:01.540
You still there, ace?

01:56:03.292 --> 01:56:06.295
Okay. Nicely done.

01:56:06.379 --> 01:56:09.007
Nicely done.
Now let's talk about this.

01:56:09.090 --> 01:56:11.468
Okay, let's see. How'd you put it?
'' Deal with it. It's over.''

01:56:11.551 --> 01:56:14.679
No, I don't think so. You want me
to list the ways I can burn you?

01:56:14.721 --> 01:56:17.891
We either work this out right now,
or I will take you down.

01:56:17.975 --> 01:56:21.395
Oh, yeah? How?
My shop, my tools, they're gone.

01:56:21.478 --> 01:56:24.231
Me, my friend, I'm just
a taxpaying jazz club owner.

01:56:24.315 --> 01:56:27.318
You? Every cop in the city's
looking for you right about now.

01:56:28.069 --> 01:56:31.364
So if I were you, I'd quit
making threats and hit the road.

01:56:35.327 --> 01:56:37.371
Nice working with you, ace.

01:56:37.412 --> 01:56:39.706
Okay, bye-bye.

01:57:12.617 --> 01:57:15.495
Montreal was stunned
by the daring predawn robbery...

01:57:15.537 --> 01:57:18.415
of the old city's historic
customshouse.

01:57:18.498 --> 01:57:22.044
A priceless scepter was stolen.
A senior night janitor...

01:57:22.127 --> 01:57:24.046
identified this man...

01:57:24.129 --> 01:57:26.048
as the prime suspect
in the burglary.

01:57:26.132 --> 01:57:29.343
He was spotted leaving the scene
moments after the robbery...

01:57:29.427 --> 01:57:31.888
and is now the focus
of a massive manhunt.

01:57:31.930 --> 01:57:35.684
A second suspect vanished
from the scene without a trace.

01:57:35.767 --> 01:57:38.937
Police have no solid leads.
