He's a Jedi.
He has a friend that can help us get home.

00:11.208 --> 00:12.624
At Attin? At Attin?

00:12.625 --> 00:17.082
Your home has been purposely hidden
from the rest of the galaxy.

00:17.083 --> 00:20.707
This scroll depicts
the Jewels of the Old Republic.

00:20.708 --> 00:24.624
Long ago, they were all destroyed,
except for one.

We need a map.

[Jod] I've got the coordinates. Come on.

00:49.416 --> 00:52.832
We are not going anywhere
until you tell us who you are.

00:52.833 --> 00:54.457
[Wim] You are a Jedi, right?

00:54.458 --> 00:55.874
I never actually said that.

00:55.875 --> 00:58.082
- What?
- But you and me, we want the same thing.

00:58.083 --> 01:00.124
Let's make a deal. I'll get you home.

01:00.125 --> 01:02.375
Maybe get a little reward.
We'll make a partnership.

02:10.958 --> 02:13.040
Hey, no adults in the cockpit.

Yeah, right.

You work for us, remember?

02:19.333 --> 02:22.207
[SM-33] You heard her.
C-Captain Fern gave an order.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.708
[Jod] Yes, Captain Fern. I'm so sorry.

Oh, we're being locked into

02:50.666 --> 02:52.124
Wait, is that normal?

02:52.125 --> 02:53.457
Is it normal? Do you know?

02:53.458 --> 02:56.125

03:55.041 --> 03:56.041
So...

03:59.250 --> 04:00.583
This is At Attin?

04:01.583 --> 04:04.000
[smacks lips] It tastes like ashy dust.

04:04.958 --> 04:07.332
Looks a lot like my home planet, actually.

04:07.333 --> 04:08.582
[Neel] No, wait!

Okay, so be careful where you step.

04:47.125 --> 04:49.041
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know. We got it.

See, it looks like home, but it can't be.

This tree is way too big.

it happened a long time ago.

Dummy, this isn't a story.
He's saying this isn't At Attin.

05:08.125 --> 05:10.457
Uh, Fern, it looks exactly like it.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.625
It does look exactly like home.

05:13.666 --> 05:16.290
But Kh'ymm said that there were
other hidden planets like ours

05:16.291 --> 05:17.832
that were all destroyed.

05:17.833 --> 05:21.207
So maybe this is another planet,
co-founded with At Attin.

05:21.208 --> 05:24.249
And anyone that lives here
might know about home.

05:24.250 --> 05:25.791

So, you don't have any ancient maps
or any star charts or--

What about the knowledge hidden
in the Fallen Sanctum?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.290

- Fallen Sanctum?

12:23.291 --> 12:24.416
What's that?

12:25.458 --> 12:28.124
There are old carvings.

Coordinates for other planets.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.790
Perhaps one of them is your home?

Can you take us there?

12:34.416 --> 12:36.875
[sighs] No, that's too dangerous.

12:38.208 --> 12:40.332
It is a distant place.

But yet...

13:49.041 --> 13:50.791
What flag do you fly?

13:51.750 --> 13:53.000
[blasters loading]

13:56.833 --> 13:58.333
You know what, just shoot me.

14:04.375 --> 14:06.166
- [object clatters]
- [Hayna] Good. Now move.

14:08.125 --> 14:09.332
Hey, hey!

14:09.333 --> 14:10.832
[Fern] Bet you can't hit this!

14:10.833 --> 14:13.832
- [Wim] Oh, really? Well, watch this!
- Your friends are hopeless.

14:13.833 --> 14:16.000
- [blasters firing]
- Yeah, I know.

14:18.250 --> 14:19.416
[playful chatter]

14:21.666 --> 14:23.125
Do you not wish to join them?

14:24.166 --> 14:26.375
- [Wim] Yeah!
- No, not really.

14:27.458 --> 14:28.500
You're wise.

14:31.291 --> 14:32.875
These weapons are weak.

14:33.833 --> 14:36.332
Come, I will show you something bigger.

14:36.333 --> 14:38.291
Wait. Where are we going?

14:38.833 --> 14:40.083
[door sliding]

14:43.041 --> 14:44.040
[kid 1] This is mine!

14:44.041 --> 14:45.125
[kid 2] No, wait.

14:48.833 --> 14:50.083
- [kid 1] No!
- [kid 2] Give it back!

14:54.916 --> 14:57.333
[Neel] This is where you live?

14:58.083 --> 14:59.875
On the roof of the school?

15:00.458 --> 15:02.291
[Hayna] Come, claim your daily ration.

15:04.125 --> 15:06.625
[Neel] This planet
is so different from mine.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.125
Why are you in a war?

15:12.291 --> 15:16.040
Last week,
the Hattan stole a herd of our eopies.

15:16.041 --> 15:19.500
The beasts may stink,
but our lives depend on them.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.791
So today, we will raid to take them back
and burn their granary.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.041
The old ones say
each generation grows weaker.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.249
But when my father dies,

15:29.250 --> 15:32.000
I will be the one
to lead my clan to victory.

15:38.750 --> 15:40.750
[♪ melancholic music playing]

15:45.000 --> 15:46.708
Are you guys hungry?

15:58.666 --> 16:01.125
Hey! Here is what I wanted to show you.

16:08.041 --> 16:09.541
[mechanism whirring]

16:11.791 --> 16:13.208
Whoa.

16:19.583 --> 16:21.499
This weapon still works from the Old Days.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.666
Its strength is what keeps us safe here.

16:25.791 --> 16:26.957
This isn't fair.

16:26.958 --> 16:29.499
You shouldn't have to be at war
all the time.

16:29.500 --> 16:30.750
See that building?

16:31.916 --> 16:35.290
On my planet,
that's where my mom's job is.

16:35.291 --> 16:37.124
And when I'm done with school,

16:37.125 --> 16:39.832
the Supervisor will
give me a job there too.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.541
It's peaceful.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.916
So, there's no combat on this At Attin?

16:45.750 --> 16:49.166
No. But we do play this one game
called slap ball.

16:50.083 --> 16:51.666
You know, like the...

16:55.041 --> 16:56.875
Uh, I'm one of the best players.

16:58.416 --> 17:01.749
You must be a very weak clan.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.166
[Neel sighs]

17:05.041 --> 17:07.208
Yeah, you're probably right. [grunts]

17:10.625 --> 17:11.875
We never have to fight.

17:12.666 --> 17:13.791
For anything.

17:15.625 --> 17:18.041
We have always had to fight
just to survive.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.915
We fight for food.

17:23.916 --> 17:26.082
We fight to protect our friends.

17:26.083 --> 17:27.500
We are strong.

17:28.708 --> 17:31.290
But fighting is...

17:31.291 --> 17:32.832
Fighting is bad.

17:32.833 --> 17:37.583
If you just keep raiding each other,
do you think it'll even ever end?

17:39.458 --> 17:40.458
Yes.

17:41.083 --> 17:44.415
If it was me, I'd just say I was sorry.

17:44.416 --> 17:45.625
No more fighting.

17:46.166 --> 17:50.250
But that's probably just 'cause
I get too scared

17:50.958 --> 17:53.041
'cause I'm from a weak clan.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.041
Never mind. You shouldn't listen to me.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.582
You know, the one fight I was ever in

18:01.583 --> 18:04.999
was this one time my little brother,
Jorko, stole my protractor,

18:05.000 --> 18:08.957
and I chased him all around the house
until he jumped on my head,

18:08.958 --> 18:12.832
and I fell on the credenza
and sprained my trunk.

18:12.833 --> 18:14.915
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

18:14.916 --> 18:16.124
He totally beat me,

18:16.125 --> 18:18.457
- even though he's about half my size.
- [laughs]

18:18.458 --> 18:19.791
[both laughing]

18:23.708 --> 18:25.625
[Hayna] I've never met
anyone like you before.

18:34.291 --> 18:36.833
Whoa! Oh, nice, KB.

18:42.333 --> 18:44.666
- Where have they been?
- [Wim] Oh, Neel, Neel, check this out!

18:45.958 --> 18:48.124
[straining] Look at this thing.

18:48.125 --> 18:51.166
[Fern] Wim. No, Wim,
I don't think that's a good idea.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.958
No, it's fine, it's fine.
Just look. Just look.

18:54.791 --> 18:56.208
[cranking]

18:56.750 --> 18:58.541
[screams, breathing heavily]

18:59.375 --> 19:00.541
[Fern and Neel chuckle]

19:03.125 --> 19:05.583
I see you train with spirit, my boy.

19:07.458 --> 19:10.374
And now, you will prove your potential.

19:10.375 --> 19:16.874
Captain Fern and her crew
will honor us by leading us into battle.

19:16.875 --> 19:17.958
What?

19:19.208 --> 19:20.208
Um...

19:22.208 --> 19:25.375
That's very gracious of you, but...

19:27.791 --> 19:28.958
No, thanks.

19:31.166 --> 19:32.290
[staff clanking]

19:32.291 --> 19:33.625
[Troik warriors grunting]

19:34.791 --> 19:36.207
[Wim softly] It'll be fine.

19:36.208 --> 19:39.583
We'll just win the battle,
and he'll take us to the Fallen Sanctum.

19:40.166 --> 19:41.624
Are you crazy?

19:41.625 --> 19:44.999
As soon as the fighting begins,
drop your weapon and follow Fern.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.999
Quiet. Even talking of desertion
will get you shot.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.375
- [Troik warrior] Hold.
- [electronic warbling]

19:52.625 --> 19:53.958
[♪ suspenseful music playing]

20:10.458 --> 20:12.041
Go now. Scout ahead.

20:14.541 --> 20:15.708
Us?

20:16.833 --> 20:18.458
Hmm... [grunts]

20:18.625 --> 20:20.125
[blasters loading]

20:22.333 --> 20:23.333
Come on.

20:30.916 --> 20:32.875
Fern, how are we gonna run away from this?

20:44.958 --> 20:46.541
[breath trembling]

20:52.125 --> 20:53.124
- [Wim] Neel?
- [Neel] No.

20:53.125 --> 20:54.833
[Wim] Neel, come on, let's go.

20:58.541 --> 20:59.749
I will go with them.

20:59.750 --> 21:00.833
Hayna!

21:02.333 --> 21:03.624
[hesitates] You don't have to.

21:03.625 --> 21:05.625
I thought you might be nervous.

21:06.291 --> 21:09.208
[sighs] I'm terrified.

21:09.708 --> 21:12.916
When I feel that way,
it is better to be with a friend.

21:13.708 --> 21:14.708
Friend?

21:15.791 --> 21:16.791
Very well.

21:17.625 --> 21:18.666
Then go.

21:23.083 --> 21:25.458
Okay. [nervously] Okay.

21:26.333 --> 21:27.333
Okay.

21:28.625 --> 21:29.708
Yeah.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.708
It is better with a friend.

21:33.291 --> 21:36.541
But let me just say, as a friend...

21:37.208 --> 21:39.458
[breathing heavily] this isn't right.

21:41.916 --> 21:45.540
And I'm not just saying this
because I'm scared.

21:45.541 --> 21:47.291
Even though I am scared.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.083
But, I mean, fighting in a raid?

21:52.041 --> 21:53.665
I don't want to hurt anybody.

21:53.666 --> 21:58.790
The really brave thing
would be to just make peace already.

21:58.791 --> 22:00.083

22:29.416 --> 22:31.041
You're the Troiks, right?

22:34.041 --> 22:36.458
I believe these belong to you.

22:57.500 --> 22:58.874
Name your rewards.

22:58.875 --> 23:01.208
Weapons? Hides?

23:02.833 --> 23:03.957
These four.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.249
The little ones.

23:05.250 --> 23:06.333
Yeah.

23:09.125 --> 23:10.125
Yeah, I need them.

23:12.833 --> 23:14.375
- Let them go.
- [Jod] Aye.

23:15.750 --> 23:16.833
Hey, Fern.

23:18.375 --> 23:19.582
Jod, you actually--

23:19.583 --> 23:20.750
- We're saved!
- [Jod grunts]

23:24.166 --> 23:25.750
- Thanks.
- It's all right.

23:26.708 --> 23:28.124
[KB] Thank you.

23:28.125 --> 23:29.291
Yeah, of course.

23:30.333 --> 23:31.333
Okay, let's go.

23:32.583 --> 23:36.083
Are you sure you'd rather have them
over our best hides?

23:36.666 --> 23:37.874
How many hides?

23:37.875 --> 23:39.583
- Jod!
- No, I'm joking.

23:40.666 --> 23:43.750
- Come on, let's go.
- Papa, they have proven their bravery.

23:46.791 --> 23:47.999
Come.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.083
I will take you to the Fallen Sanctum.

23:51.875 --> 23:55.457
[Jod] So there I was,
surrounded by warriors

23:55.458 --> 23:59.832
who tell me you lot have [chuckling]
joined up with their sworn enemy.

23:59.833 --> 24:01.165
Wasn't looking good.

But, hey, those Hattan guys,
they love a bargain.

24:05.541 --> 24:08.415
So, well, couple of Republic credits...

24:08.416 --> 24:11.749
- [Wim] Wait, what--
- And I bought the whole herd. What?

24:11.750 --> 24:12.875
Where'd you get--

24:14.125 --> 24:15.833
[Wim] Did you steal my dataries?

24:18.416 --> 24:19.458
Yeah.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.957
To save your lives.

24:22.958 --> 24:24.791
[Hayna] There lies the Fallen Sanctum.

of the Supervisor's Tower.

24:31.541 --> 24:32.625
[Neel] Whoa.

24:33.083 --> 24:35.874
On At Attin, no one's allowed up there.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.332
C-Can't say I remember no At Attin.

24:38.333 --> 24:39.415

24:43.708 --> 24:45.457

24:45.458 --> 24:46.958
Wait, you're not coming?

24:48.583 --> 24:50.500
I must return to aid my father.

24:51.208 --> 24:52.915
Come with us, Hayna.

24:52.916 --> 24:54.791
My house has plenty of room.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.208
At Attin is peaceful.

25:01.791 --> 25:02.791
No.

25:08.041 --> 25:11.958
Perhaps someday,
when I am leader of the Troik,

25:14.041 --> 25:15.833
I will remember your ways.

25:19.083 --> 25:20.166
I see now.

25:21.458 --> 25:22.958
Your weakness...

25:24.708 --> 25:26.416
it makes you kind.

25:29.666 --> 25:32.000
And my world could use some kindness.

Move your trunk.

but here...

I remember no At Attin.

that Kh'ymm gave us to this system.

Why? Were you looking for those?

28:14.291 --> 28:16.083
You destroyed them?

You were here?

28:42.375 --> 28:45.500
There's probably only
a couple hundred million circuits.

28:46.958 --> 28:48.166
[Jod] Good luck with that.

28:56.500 --> 28:58.332
[Wim] What do we do now, Captain?

28:58.333 --> 28:59.416
[voice breaking] Captain.

29:00.500 --> 29:01.583
[crying]

29:03.791 --> 29:04.958
I have no idea.

29:09.375 --> 29:11.708
I have no idea what I'm doing.

29:17.041 --> 29:18.583
You should've been captain.

29:19.416 --> 29:21.875
I wouldn't have gotten us this far.

29:22.708 --> 29:26.625
I just led us into a battle
and almost got us all killed.

29:27.875 --> 29:29.375
We made it out.

29:31.166 --> 29:32.166
Yeah.

29:33.166 --> 29:34.583
But now we're stuck.

29:35.916 --> 29:37.291
You'll figure something out.

29:39.125 --> 29:40.875
'Cause you're amazing, Fern.

29:41.375 --> 29:44.332
You can't just say, "You're amazing,
now figure something out."

29:44.333 --> 29:46.916
Like I'm supposed to solve everything.

29:48.291 --> 29:49.500
I'm not a droid.

29:50.583 --> 29:52.708
I don't just do whatever I'm told.

30:02.083 --> 30:03.540
Knock it off.

30:03.541 --> 30:05.707
33, where's At Attin?

30:05.708 --> 30:08.082
C-Can't say I remember no At Attin.

30:08.083 --> 30:09.625
What are you doing?

30:10.416 --> 30:11.958
Droids do what they're told.

30:12.708 --> 30:16.165
What if he "can't say" because
he was ordered not to?

30:16.166 --> 30:18.874
I use the same trick
on my nanny droid back home.

30:18.875 --> 30:22.749
[breathing heavily] 33, I'm your captain.

30:22.750 --> 30:24.500
Run memory override.

30:25.291 --> 30:28.291
You remember everything about At Attin.

30:29.541 --> 30:31.208
[circuits whirring]

30:35.583 --> 30:37.707
Ah, yes.

30:37.708 --> 30:40.083
I do remember At Attin.

30:40.708 --> 30:43.249
It was in this very room.

30:43.250 --> 30:48.083
The captain killed any of his crew
that saw the coordinates to At Attin.

30:48.666 --> 30:50.624
Slaughtered them, he did.

30:50.625 --> 30:53.290
Then he ordered me to destroy them

30:53.291 --> 30:56.624
and forget everything
I knew about At Attin.

30:56.625 --> 30:59.500
But you can take us there now, right?

31:00.541 --> 31:05.665
And then he told me,
if anyone ever comes poking around,

31:05.666 --> 31:07.500
looking for the treasure...

31:09.166 --> 31:10.832
Wim, give me the blaster.

31:10.833 --> 31:13.999
He told me to pull them apart.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.166
[♪ foreboding music playing]

31:16.083 --> 31:17.875
Pull 'em apart.

31:19.083 --> 31:21.916
- Pull 'em apart.
- [blaster sputters]

31:23.333 --> 31:25.166
Pull 'em apart.

31:27.208 --> 31:29.833
[growling, stuttering] Limb from limb.

31:31.291 --> 31:33.458
I'm the captain. And I order you to--

31:33.958 --> 31:36.082
- Stop!
- Limb from limb.

31:36.083 --> 31:38.166
- 33!
- Limb from limb!

31:40.541 --> 31:41.541
Hey!

31:42.791 --> 31:44.249
Leave 'em alone!

31:44.250 --> 31:45.916
[♪ heroic music playing]

31:48.833 --> 31:51.791
- Limb from limb!
- [whimpers]

31:52.291 --> 31:54.749
- Limb from limb!
- [switch beeps]

31:54.750 --> 31:57.083
[powering down] Limb from limb.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.125
[Neel panting]

32:02.083 --> 32:04.499
Always go for the off switch.

32:04.500 --> 32:05.832
[Wim] Neel!

32:05.833 --> 32:07.082
Neel, you saved us.

32:07.083 --> 32:08.790
- [chuckling] Neel!
- That was very brave.

32:08.791 --> 32:11.791
[stuttering, wheezing]

32:14.666 --> 32:15.666
[Wim] Neel.

32:16.708 --> 32:17.708
Neel.

32:19.625 --> 32:20.708
He fainted.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.500
