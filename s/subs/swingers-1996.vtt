02:38.095 --> 02:41.724
- Okay, so what if l don't
want to give up on her?
- You don't call.

02:41.799 --> 02:44.792
- You said l don't call if
l wanted to give up on her.
- Right.

02:44.870 --> 02:47.930
- So l don't call either way.
- Right.

02:48.006 --> 02:51.635
- So what's the difference?
- There is no difference right now.

02:51.710 --> 02:54.770
See, Mike, the only difference
between giving up and not giving up...

02:54.846 --> 02:57.474
is if you take her back
when she wants to come back.

02:57.549 --> 03:00.144
But you can't do anything
to make her want to come back.

03:00.219 --> 03:03.279
ln fact, you can only do stuff
to make her not want to come back.

03:03.356 --> 03:07.190
So the only difference is
if l forget about her or just
pretend to forget about her.

03:07.260 --> 03:10.127
- Right.
- Well, that sucks.

03:10.196 --> 03:12.859
Yeah, it sucks.

03:12.933 --> 03:17.233
So it's like a retroactive
decision then? l mean, l
could, like, forget about her.

03:17.304 --> 03:20.637
And then when she comes back, make like
l just pretended to forget about her?

03:22.009 --> 03:25.274
Right, although probably
more likely the opposite.

03:25.346 --> 03:27.281
What do you mean?

03:27.349 --> 03:30.284
l mean, at first you're gonna pretend
to forget about her.

03:30.352 --> 03:32.786
Not call her,
l don't know, whatever.

03:32.854 --> 03:35.118
But then, eventually,
you really will forget about her.

03:35.190 --> 03:38.591
- Well, unless she comes back first.
- Mm, see, that's the thing.

03:38.660 --> 03:41.562
Somehow they know not to come back
until you really forget.

03:45.368 --> 03:47.893
- There's the rub.
- There's the rub.

03:50.973 --> 03:56.310
Look, man, uh, l-l'm sorry we always
talk about the same thing all the time.

03:56.380 --> 03:59.713
- Ah, no, it's all right.
- lt's just that, you know...
lt's just you been there, man.

03:59.783 --> 04:02.081
- Don't sweat it.
- Your advice really helps.
And l just, l don't know...

04:02.152 --> 04:05.918
You know, Rob, you're the only one
l can talk to about her.

04:05.989 --> 04:09.015

We all miss you
back here in New York.

04:41.127 --> 04:44.062
You still haven't told me if you got
that part on the television pro...

04:44.130 --> 04:48.464
- That was your last message.

You have to put things in perspective.

04:53.706 --> 04:57.143

[Trent] Hey, we got two parties
tonight. One's for a modeling agency.

05:20.836 --> 05:23.772
- l don't know.
- Listen to me, baby. There's
gonna be beautiful babies there.

05:23.840 --> 05:26.604
l... Look, Trent, uh,
l got shit to do tomorrow.

05:26.676 --> 05:29.611
Listen to you.
l've got a final callback on a pilot
at 9:00, and l'm going to this thing.

05:29.679 --> 05:32.113
Come on, Mike, you got to get out
with the beautiful babies.

05:32.181 --> 05:34.945
- You can't sit
at home thinking about it.
- Not tonight.

05:35.017 --> 05:37.612
Not tonight? Listen to you!
We're gonna have fun tonight.

05:37.688 --> 05:40.122
- We gotta get you out
of that stuffy apartment.
- [Sighs]

05:40.190 --> 05:43.284
We're gonna spend half the night
driving around the hills looking
for this one party,

05:43.360 --> 05:45.794
and you're gonna say it sucks,
and we're all gonna leave,

05:45.863 --> 05:47.797
and then we're gonna go look
for this other party.

05:47.865 --> 05:50.129
But all the parties
and all the bars, they all suck.

05:50.200 --> 05:53.136
l spend half the night talkin' to some
girl who's lookin' around the room...

05:53.204 --> 05:56.298
to see if there's somebody else who's
more important she should be talking to.

05:56.374 --> 06:00.208
And it's like l'm supposed
to be all happy, uh, 'cause
she's wearing a backpack.

06:00.278 --> 06:03.076
l... You know, and half of them
are just nasty skanks...

06:03.147 --> 06:06.879
who wouldn't be nothing, except
they're surrounded by a bunch
of drunken, horny assholes.

06:06.952 --> 06:09.250
l'm gonna tell you something, T.
Are you listening?

06:09.321 --> 06:13.348
- Yeah, l'm listening.
- l'm not gonna be one of
those assholes, all right?

06:13.425 --> 06:15.359
lt just makes me sick.

06:15.427 --> 06:18.089
lt's like, uh, some nasty skank who
isn't half the woman my girlfriend is...

06:18.163 --> 06:20.097
is gonna front me?

06:20.165 --> 06:22.100
- lt makes me want to fuckin' puke.
- Jesus Christ!

06:22.168 --> 06:25.103
Will you shut up for a minute? We gotta
get you the fuck out of Dodge, man.

06:25.171 --> 06:28.504
- We're goin' to Vegas tonight.
- What are you talkin' about?

06:28.575 --> 06:32.102
- Vegas, baby. Vegas!
- What do you mean, Vegas?

06:32.178 --> 06:34.612
- Vegas. Las Vegas.
- l'm not going to no Vegas.

06:34.681 --> 06:37.879
Yeah. l think... You know what, man?
We're gonna go to Vegas and, uh...

06:37.952 --> 06:39.886
- When are we going to Vegas?
- We're going tonight.

06:39.954 --> 06:42.115
- No, we're not going tonight.
l'm not going to Vegas!
- l'm gonna pick you up.

06:42.189 --> 06:44.919
- Listen to me.
- No, you listen to me.
l'm not going, okay?

06:44.992 --> 06:48.792
- None of this shit anymore.
- Listen, l just listened
to you; now hear me out.

06:48.863 --> 06:51.628
- You bring something nice to wear.
- [Laughs]

06:51.700 --> 06:53.759
- l'm not going to Vegas.
- Mike, we're going.

06:53.835 --> 06:55.769
l'm not going to Vegas.

06:55.837 --> 07:00.137
All right, listen. l took out $300,
but l'm only betting with 100.

07:00.208 --> 07:03.371
l can't afford any more
than that, all right?

07:03.445 --> 07:05.676
And l figure if we buy a lot of chips,
though, the pit boss will see us,

07:05.748 --> 07:08.080
he'll comp us all sorts of free shit;
that's how it works over there.

07:08.151 --> 07:10.085
- But you gotta be cool.
- l'm cool, baby, l'm cool.

07:10.153 --> 07:13.179
They're gonna give Daddy a room,
some breakfast, maybe Bennett singing.

07:13.256 --> 07:15.781
- l know just the place.
- What the hell are you wearin'?

07:15.858 --> 07:17.792
l thought you said
we're gonna wear suits.

07:17.860 --> 07:20.659
Oh, Mike, you gotta stop worrying
about this. We're goin' to Vegas, man.

07:20.731 --> 07:24.258
lf you're wearing a suit,
and you look like you gamble
a lot, they give you free shit.

07:24.335 --> 07:26.565
lt's in the back.
l'll put it on when we get there.

07:26.637 --> 07:28.832
Uh-uh. No way. No, turn around.
l'm goin' home.

07:28.906 --> 07:31.306
You gotta show up wearing that suit,
or otherwise l'm not going.

07:31.375 --> 07:35.312
All right already, okay? l'll put my
suit on. Grab the wheel. Hold it steady.

07:35.380 --> 07:37.780
- l'm tellin' you, this is how you do it.
- l know!

07:37.849 --> 07:40.545
- They're watching you when you
drive up. That's how it works.
- Fine, fine.

07:40.619 --> 07:42.484
lt could work.
l'm serious.

07:42.554 --> 07:45.022
They're gonna give Daddy
the Rain Man suite. You dig that?

07:45.090 --> 07:47.115
- We're going to Vegas, Mike. Vegas!
- Vegas!

07:47.192 --> 07:49.127
You think we can
get there by midnight?

07:49.195 --> 07:51.129
- We're gonna be up five
"hundy" by midnight!
- Yeah!

07:51.197 --> 07:54.826
- Vegas! Vegas!
- Vegas, baby. Vegas!

08:00.373 --> 08:03.070
- [Quietly] Vegas, baby. Vegas.
- [Radio: Country]

08:03.143 --> 08:08.012
'Cause l'm not the happy guy
l used to be

08:09.583 --> 08:12.575
She thinks l

08:12.653 --> 08:17.387
Still care

08:17.458 --> 08:21.394
But if she's happy thinking

08:21.462 --> 08:24.090
l still need her

08:27.602 --> 08:29.763
Vegas, baby. Vegas.

08:35.010 --> 08:36.943
Vegas.

08:38.347 --> 08:42.613
[Big Band]

09:02.673 --> 09:05.574
lt's the root of all evil
Of strife and upheaval

09:05.643 --> 09:08.476
But l'm certain, honey

09:09.914 --> 09:13.077
That life would be sunny

09:13.150 --> 09:16.985
With plenty of money

09:17.055 --> 09:21.082
And you

09:29.534 --> 09:32.338
[Slot Machines Dinging]

09:32.338 --> 09:34.772
[Mike] l always thought, uh,
Caesar's was more the dope spot.

09:34.840 --> 09:38.276
Back in their day, this place
was a real contender, but now
they'll appreciate the business.

09:38.344 --> 09:41.438
They'll probably fall all over
themselves for a couple of
high-class guys like me and you.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.948
- Now, we're not...
- You want to be fresh
on the scene, right?

09:44.016 --> 09:46.713
The new places down on the strip,
now, those places are supposed to be it.

09:46.787 --> 09:50.052
Oh, Mike, you don't want
all that fuckin' Pirate
of the Caribbean horseshit.

09:50.123 --> 09:52.057
Or the rock and roll
grunge tip.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.787
You know, guys like me and
you gotta kick it here. Old school.

09:54.861 --> 09:57.125
Yeah, this is...
This is truly old school.

09:57.197 --> 10:01.191
- [Trent] Definitely old school.
- This place is fuckin' dead.

10:01.269 --> 10:03.794
You know, l'm gonna find me
two waitresses here
and l'm gonna pull me a Fredo.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.066
- Yeah, well, they're all skanks.
- What are you talkin' about?

10:06.140 --> 10:08.074
Look at all the
beautiful babies here.

10:08.142 --> 10:11.134
The beautiful babies don't work
midnights to 6:00 on a... on a Wednesday.

10:11.212 --> 10:14.182
- This is the skank shift.
- Look at all the beautiful honeys here.

10:14.249 --> 10:18.083
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me, darling. l want you
to remember this face here.

10:18.153 --> 10:22.021
This is the guy behind the guy
behind the guy.

10:24.026 --> 10:26.620
Okay.

10:26.695 --> 10:29.324
Will you cut that shit out?

10:29.399 --> 10:32.061
- What? She smiled.
- That's not cool, man.

10:32.135 --> 10:34.831
- Did she or did she not smile?
- lt doesn't matter.

10:34.904 --> 10:37.964
- Mike, l'm telling you,
girls love that stuff.
- You're gonna screw up our plan.

10:38.041 --> 10:41.670
- Baby, we're gonna get laid.
- Could we first see what happens
when we play it cool?

10:41.744 --> 10:46.045
What do you think, Mike?
Do you think she's gonna leave us
and go tell her pit boss on us?

10:46.116 --> 10:48.050
Will you stop makin' fun,
all right?

10:48.118 --> 10:51.519
The trick is we gotta look
like we don't need the shit,
then they give us shit for free.

10:51.589 --> 10:54.183
Right, right, right.
Well, l think you look great, man.

10:54.258 --> 10:57.285
l think l'm looking like the money,
like the bomb, right?

10:57.362 --> 11:01.025
All right, stop. See that? That, uh,
table? That's where we make our scene.

11:01.099 --> 11:03.090
[Trent] You think
they'll notice me and you?

11:03.168 --> 11:05.693
Oh, they're gonna notice me and you,
'cause they're watching.

11:05.837 --> 11:08.931
- Nicely done, sir.
You're on a streak now.
- lt's about time.

11:09.007 --> 11:13.468
One of the best streaks
l've ever had. l wanna get even.

11:17.383 --> 11:21.319
Uh, start with, uh,
l don't know, 300?

11:36.503 --> 11:39.563
l can count that
for you.

11:39.640 --> 11:41.575
- On the table.
- Excuse me?

11:41.643 --> 11:45.739
- You have to lay it on the table.
- l don't want to bet it all.

11:45.813 --> 11:47.747
You're not allowed
to hand me money, sir.

11:47.815 --> 11:51.012
You have to lay it on the table
if you want me to change it.

11:58.427 --> 12:02.329
- Changing 300.
- [Man] Three hundred.

12:10.006 --> 12:13.635
- Do you have anything smaller?
- Yes, as a matter of fact, l do.

12:13.710 --> 12:16.975
But this happens to be
a $100 minimum bet table.

12:17.047 --> 12:19.641
Perhaps you'd be more comfortable
at one of our lower stakes tables.

12:21.585 --> 12:25.078
Okay, just tuck 'em under,
just like this.

12:25.156 --> 12:27.090
There you go.

12:28.259 --> 12:30.352
[Woman]
Cocktails?

12:30.428 --> 12:32.555
Guy behind the guy.

12:32.630 --> 12:34.996
l'll have a scotch
on the rocks, please.

12:35.066 --> 12:37.728
Any scotch will do, as long
as it's not a blend, of course.

12:37.802 --> 12:40.738
Uh, single malt.
Glenlivet, Glenfiddich perhaps.

12:40.806 --> 12:42.831
Maybe a Glengow... Any Glen.

12:42.908 --> 12:45.342
Scotch on the rocks.

13:05.798 --> 13:07.790
- Double down.
- What?

13:07.868 --> 13:10.063
You got an 11.
You always double down on an 11.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.196
l know, but it's $200.
lt's blood money.

13:12.272 --> 13:14.297
- Mike, you gotta double down.
- l can't double down.

13:14.375 --> 13:16.400
- Mike, if you don't look like
you know what you're doing...
- Will you stop for a second?

13:16.477 --> 13:18.741
- Just shut up, okay? l can't.
- lf you don't look like you
know what you're doing...

13:18.812 --> 13:20.712
Just stop for a second!

13:20.781 --> 13:23.273
[Arguing Continues]

13:23.351 --> 13:25.148
Double down.

13:27.656 --> 13:30.022
That's nice.

13:30.091 --> 13:32.025
[Trent]
Eighteen. Good. Eighteen's good.

13:37.066 --> 13:40.627
[Dealer]
Twelve. Sixteen.

13:44.273 --> 13:46.366
Twenty-one.

13:48.044 --> 13:50.342
l'm telling you, baby,
you always double down on an 11.

13:50.413 --> 13:52.507
- Well, obviously not always.
- Always, baby.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.846
l'm just saying not
in this particular case.

13:54.918 --> 13:57.853
- You always double...
- l lost, okay?
How could you say "always"?

13:57.921 --> 14:02.187
- [Dealer] Lady has 11.
What would you like to do?
- Um, l hit.

14:02.259 --> 14:05.957
- Fifteen.
- l don't know what to do here.

14:06.030 --> 14:08.396
l'll hit again.

14:08.466 --> 14:10.400
Seventeen.

14:11.869 --> 14:14.963
Okay. l'll hit there. Okay.

14:15.039 --> 14:17.803
- Twenty-one.
- Oh, my gosh! Twenty-one!

14:17.875 --> 14:20.674
l got it!
Oh, my heavens. Thank you!

14:20.746 --> 14:22.737
Whee!

14:22.815 --> 14:25.613
Would you like to have some breakfast
this morning, ma'am?

14:25.684 --> 14:29.245
Oh, l really shouldn't. But then again,
it's a good idea. l'd love it.

14:29.321 --> 14:31.482
- Thank you so much!
- Why not? By all means.

14:31.557 --> 14:33.491
- Take this ticket in with you
when you go in.
- Oh, thank you!

14:33.559 --> 14:35.494
- They'll fix you up.
- You'll fix me up.

14:38.898 --> 14:42.231
That went plenty nice, baby.
You're up 20 bucks.

14:42.302 --> 14:44.827
You know, l mean not counting
what happened on the first table.

14:44.904 --> 14:47.099
- Thanks for clarifying that.
- l'm down too, Mike.

14:47.173 --> 14:50.575
- Yeah? What'd you lose?
- l don't know what l dropped.

14:50.644 --> 14:53.010
Let's see, l dropped
probably 35 or...

14:53.080 --> 14:56.345
Don't give me that shit. You know
exactly what you lost. What'd you drop?

14:56.417 --> 15:00.012
Twenty, all right? But l was
down at least fifty. l'm sorry.
l got lucky on the craps table.

15:00.087 --> 15:02.783
You shouldn't be sorry.
You're a winner. l'm the fuckin' loser.

15:02.857 --> 15:05.122
- l'm the one who should be sorry.
- Baby, don't talk that way.

15:05.193 --> 15:07.286
Could we just go, please?
Could we go?

15:07.362 --> 15:09.296
Baby, look at me. Look at me.

15:09.364 --> 15:12.299
You're money. And you know what else?
You're a big winner tonight.

15:12.367 --> 15:14.301
- l want to leave.
- You're a big winner.

15:14.369 --> 15:17.133
l'm gonna ask you a simple question,
and l want you to listen to me.

15:17.205 --> 15:21.472
Who's the big winner
here tonight at the casino? Huh?

15:21.544 --> 15:24.035
- Mikey, that's who.
Mikey's the big winner.
- Okay.

15:24.113 --> 15:26.047
- Mikey wins.
- What a fuckin' asshole.

15:26.115 --> 15:28.982
Fine, l'm an asshole.
But you know what?
You're the big winner tonight, Mikey.

15:29.051 --> 15:31.178
- You're the big winner
in more ways than one.
- There you two are.

15:31.254 --> 15:34.656
l walked around for an hour
with that stupid scotch on my tray.

15:34.725 --> 15:37.193
We got knocked out pretty fast.

15:37.261 --> 15:39.491
- Ah, a couple of
high rollers like yourself?
- Can you believe it?

15:39.563 --> 15:41.895
- l'm gonna get you that scotch.
- You know, forget about it.

15:41.965 --> 15:44.559
- l didn't even want it.
l just wanted to order it.
- Can l get you something else?

15:44.635 --> 15:47.764
l mean, you really shouldn't leave
without getting something for free.

15:47.839 --> 15:49.773
Why ruin a perfect night?

15:49.841 --> 15:52.833
Listen, um, bring a single-malted,
uh, Glengarry for me...

15:52.911 --> 15:54.845
and one
for my boy Mikey here.

15:54.913 --> 15:57.973
And if you tell the bartender
to go easy on the water,

15:58.049 --> 16:02.453
then this 50-cent piece has your
name written all over it, okay?

16:02.521 --> 16:04.785
l want you to run along,
'cause l'll be timing you.

16:04.857 --> 16:09.385
l'm gonna keep time.
One, two, three, four.

16:09.461 --> 16:12.794
- What an asshole.
- Baby, that was money.
Tell me that wasn't money.

16:12.865 --> 16:15.129
- That was so demeaning.
- She smiled, baby.

16:15.201 --> 16:18.137
- l can't believe
what an asshole you are.
- No, baby, she smiled.

16:18.205 --> 16:21.140
- She was smiling at
what an asshole you are.
- No, no, no, no, no.

16:21.208 --> 16:23.802
- She was smiling at how money
l was, what l did with her.
- Could we get out of here?

16:23.877 --> 16:26.812
- l'm not gonna pay for a room.
- Mike, what the hell do you
want to get out of here for?

16:26.880 --> 16:29.314
- The honey baby's
bringing us a cocktail.
- What, are you nuts?

16:29.382 --> 16:31.749
- You think she's coming back here?
- l know she's coming back.

16:31.819 --> 16:34.754
Did you hear what she said?
"You shouldn't leave without
getting something for free."

16:34.822 --> 16:37.723
Baby, she wants to party.
She wants to.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.726
l'm tired. We should just go.

16:39.794 --> 16:42.922
Baby, this is what we came for. Now, we
met a beautiful baby, and she likes you.

16:42.997 --> 16:45.990
- She likes you.
- Whatever. Daddy's gonna
get her to bring a friend.

16:46.068 --> 16:49.231
Now, l don't care if l end up with her
or one of her beautiful baby friends.

16:51.807 --> 16:55.140
lt's just l been... l been out
of the game for so long, man.

16:55.210 --> 16:59.169
- lt's been like six years.
- Listen, it's hard, l know.
l been there myself.

16:59.248 --> 17:01.384
Not for six years or anything,
but l've been there.

17:01.384 --> 17:02.316
Not for six years or anything,
but l've been there.

17:02.385 --> 17:04.979
The best thing you can do
is just get back out there.

17:05.054 --> 17:09.115
lt's just l... l'm not attracted to them.
l keep thinking of my girlfriend.

17:09.191 --> 17:12.126
Then l'm trying to, like,
maintain a conversation with them.

17:12.194 --> 17:15.961
Mike, do you even think l know
what the hell they're saying
to me half the time?

17:16.031 --> 17:18.465
l don't know if they're talking
about how hard it is to be adopted...

17:18.535 --> 17:20.969
or how their dad
can't show 'em affection.

17:21.037 --> 17:24.494
All l do, man, is stare at their mouth
and wrinkle my eyebrows,

17:24.574 --> 17:27.202
and somehow l turn out
to be a big sweetie, okay?

17:27.277 --> 17:30.805
Take this girl here.
She's a waitress in Las Vegas.

17:30.882 --> 17:34.818
But l bet somewhere inside of her
there is a very, very special dream.

17:34.886 --> 17:37.320
- And no matter how hard l try, l won't...
- [Waitress Clears Throat]

17:37.388 --> 17:40.221
Hey, there she is, the most
special lady in town, right?

17:40.291 --> 17:42.657
- Yup.
- What time do you get off, uh, Christy?

17:42.727 --> 17:44.662
- 6:00.
- 6:00, great.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.097
- Two Glengarrys down,
easy on the water.
- Fantastic.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.159
Uh, listen. Why don't you call a friend
and have her meet the three of us...

17:51.236 --> 17:53.761
- at the Bamboo Lounge at 6:01?
- You got it.

17:53.839 --> 17:56.899
- All right?
- Sure. Hey.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.742
That was so fuckin' money.
That was like the Jedi mind shit.

18:02.816 --> 18:05.614
See, that's what l'm trying to tell you,
baby. Girls love that kind of stuff.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.653
They don't go
for the sensitive shit.

18:07.720 --> 18:11.121
You start talking to 'em about, uh,
you know, puppy dogs and ice cream.

18:11.191 --> 18:14.628
They know what you want to do.
What do you think?
You really think they don't know?

18:14.695 --> 18:17.459
- No. l know.
- They know what you want,
baby. Believe me.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.965
When you pretend it's just
like a waste of their time.

18:20.034 --> 18:23.367
You're gonna take 'em
that way eventually, right?
Don't apologize for it.

18:23.437 --> 18:27.340
lt's just that l get this thing
where l want to be a gentleman
and l wanna show respect.

18:27.409 --> 18:29.934
Oh, Mike.
Respect, my ass.

18:30.011 --> 18:32.036
What they respect is honesty.

18:32.113 --> 18:35.981
Look, you see how they dress
when they go out, right?
They want you to notice 'em.

18:36.051 --> 18:39.248
All you're doin' is letting
them know that it's working.
Get off this respect kick.

18:39.321 --> 18:42.291
There's nothing wrong with letting
the girls know that you're money...

18:42.358 --> 18:45.759
- and that you wanna party.
- You ready to order?

18:45.828 --> 18:48.854
Yeah. l'll have a coffee...
Two, uh, two coffees.

18:48.931 --> 18:51.559
And it says, uh, here,
"Breakfast anytime."

18:51.634 --> 18:54.000
That's right.

18:54.070 --> 18:57.871
l'll have the, uh, pancakes and the,
uh, age of enlightenment, please.

18:57.941 --> 19:00.535
And for you?

19:00.611 --> 19:05.071
Oh, um, let's see,
l'll have the, um, the Toucan.

19:05.148 --> 19:07.673
- Over easy.
- l'll be back with the coffee.

19:07.751 --> 19:09.946
All right, great.
Nice, baby.

19:10.020 --> 19:12.285
Renaissance.
lt went over her head.

19:12.357 --> 19:14.951
l should have said renaissance.
Age of enlightenment. l...

19:15.026 --> 19:19.292
Oh, God! Like a Las Vegas
waitress is gonna get an obscure
French philosophical reference?

19:19.364 --> 19:21.662
lt's like l'm trying
to show off to her.

19:21.733 --> 19:24.600
l may as well have just said,
"Let me jump your ignorant bones."

19:24.669 --> 19:27.138
Don't even sweat her.
We're gonna meet our honeys soon.

19:27.206 --> 19:29.902
- You know Christy's friend
is gonna be money.
- lt's 20 to.

19:29.975 --> 19:33.308
- We gotta get out of here.
- Baby, will you relax
just for a minute here?

19:33.379 --> 19:36.439
Excuse me. We have...
We're in a little bit of a hurry.

19:36.515 --> 19:38.449
Hang on, Voltaire.

19:50.497 --> 19:54.958
- l get paid for loving
- Hmm

19:55.036 --> 19:57.334
Loving all the time

19:57.405 --> 19:59.532
[Chattering]

19:59.607 --> 20:01.541
- How're you doin', guys?
- Hey, boys.

20:01.609 --> 20:04.169
- We almost gave up on you.
- l'm sorry we're late.

20:04.245 --> 20:07.339
- There's, uh, no clocks
in this town anywhere.
- No harm done.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.350
- This is Lisa.
- Hi.

20:09.418 --> 20:11.852
- l'm sorry. l never got your name.
- l'm Mike.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.354
- Mike.
- This is Trent. We call him Double Down.

20:14.423 --> 20:16.357
- Trent.
- Stop right there.

20:16.425 --> 20:19.189
- Ladies, don't you always
double down on an 11?
- Always.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.195
- No matter what. Like splitting aces.
- Whatever.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.892
- Hi, Lisa. l'm Trent.
lt's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

20:23.967 --> 20:25.901
Lovely, uh, make-up job
you have there.

20:25.969 --> 20:28.665
- Oh. Uh, Lisa works at the MGM Grand.
- l'm a Dorothy.

20:28.738 --> 20:31.536
Oh, Lisa's a Dorothy.
That's great. That's great.

20:33.142 --> 20:37.078
Well, we're not
in Kansas anymore.

20:40.951 --> 20:44.387
So, uh, what do
you guys do?

20:44.455 --> 20:47.015
Well, l'm a comedian.

20:47.091 --> 20:49.525
[Laughs]

20:51.795 --> 20:55.323
Um, do you ever play out here?
l'd love to see you sometime.

20:55.400 --> 20:57.334
- No.
- Why not?

20:57.402 --> 21:00.894
Well, there are, uh... You know,
it's just different circuits.

21:00.972 --> 21:03.907
- lt's hard to explain.
You wouldn't understand.
- Who's your booking agent?

21:03.975 --> 21:06.809
[Panting]
She... She knows...

21:06.879 --> 21:10.178
Actually, l don't have
West Coast representation as of yet.

21:10.249 --> 21:12.945
Oh, who's your representation
back East?

21:13.019 --> 21:17.183
l didn't... l sort of freelanced on
my own, kind of found my own things.

21:17.256 --> 21:19.554
- 'Cause l...
- So what do you do, Trent?

21:19.625 --> 21:22.595
- l'm a producer.
- Oh! Cool!

21:22.663 --> 21:24.597
[Whispers]
That's great.

21:24.665 --> 21:26.929
[Christy] l'm really
not supposed to drink here.

21:27.000 --> 21:31.562
We should go someplace else.
How's my place?

21:31.638 --> 21:33.868
- Yeah, that's great.
- Yeah?

21:33.940 --> 21:36.876
- All right?
- Yeah, we... Yeah, sure.

21:36.944 --> 21:39.708
- Right.
- Because if you can't drink here...

21:39.781 --> 21:41.715
- Then you can't drink.
- Why not?

21:41.783 --> 21:44.718
- That'll be great.
- Okay, great. Let's go.

21:44.852 --> 21:47.844
[Christy]
You were in Acapulco Beach?

21:47.922 --> 21:50.414
[Lisa]
We watch that all the time.

21:50.492 --> 21:53.655
- No, no, no, no, wait.
- [Trent] Yeah, yeah.

21:53.729 --> 21:57.495
The worst was when l went in for
this Afterschool Special, right?

21:57.566 --> 21:59.796
So l'm sitting
in the waiting room,

21:59.868 --> 22:02.962
and there's all these little kids, uh,
sitting in the waiting room with me.

22:03.038 --> 22:05.940
And l see that all the kids are signed
in for the exact same role as me.

22:06.009 --> 22:08.910
- They're auditioning for
the same role as you?
- Right.

22:08.978 --> 22:13.176
So, uh, l check the time and the place.
l'm where l'm supposed to be.

22:13.249 --> 22:17.083
l call my agent up. She says, "Trent,
they asked for you specifically."

22:17.153 --> 22:19.884
- What was the thing?
- l don't know what it was.
lt was "Drugs are Bad."

22:19.957 --> 22:22.687
"Jenny Eats Something." Whatever.
lt's Afterschool Special bullshit.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.694
- Right. [Giggles]
- "Jenny Eats Something."

22:24.762 --> 22:28.528
The role l'm reading for is "brother."
l'm reading for the part of "brother."

22:28.599 --> 22:31.124
Big brother
or little brother?

22:31.202 --> 22:34.366
- Just brother, man. Just brother.
- No.

22:34.439 --> 22:37.203
Just brother, right? Finally l get
to go in and meet everyone, right?

22:37.275 --> 22:39.470
Mikey, l'm telling you,
l was money.

22:39.544 --> 22:41.739
lt's a starring role.
l practiced for a week.

22:41.813 --> 22:45.544
So l'm reading with the casting director
and, girls, l literally start crying.

22:45.617 --> 22:47.551
- No.
- l swear to God.

22:47.619 --> 22:49.884
The casting director who's reading with
me kinda gets caught up in the vibe.

22:49.956 --> 22:51.890
- She starts crying.
- Oh!

22:51.958 --> 22:54.722
- Yeah, l swear to God. Swear to God.
- Wow.

22:54.794 --> 22:57.820
So now she's crying.
l'm crying.

22:57.897 --> 23:01.731
We're both kinda crying, but not
the kind of crying that's like...

23:01.801 --> 23:04.327
But the kind of crying that's
like we're trying not to cry.

23:04.404 --> 23:07.669
Do you know what l mean? Like we're not
trying to... Whatever. lt was very cool.

23:07.741 --> 23:10.471
So l finished reading with her.

23:10.544 --> 23:13.342
l finally hold up my finger,
like give me a minute here.

23:13.413 --> 23:15.347
- Right.
- [Choking Up] Like give me a minute.

23:15.415 --> 23:18.852
More than that, 'cause l'm in it.
But like l'm broke.

23:18.920 --> 23:23.016
[Sobbing] Give me a second here.
May l have a minute?

23:23.091 --> 23:27.187
So l put down my head,
and the whole room sits in silence...

23:27.262 --> 23:29.196
for at least five minutes.

23:29.264 --> 23:31.198
- Swear to God, five minutes.
- Whoa!

23:31.266 --> 23:33.565
l look up, everyone
rips up in applause.

23:33.636 --> 23:37.367
The whole room is rip-roaring clapping
it up for me, for big T, right?

23:37.439 --> 23:42.069
Everyone in the room is sitting
there tearing their face.
They're crying their eyes out.

23:42.144 --> 23:45.375
The guy working the camera, you know,
just filming it? Got tears in his eyes.

23:45.447 --> 23:48.383
- Not the camera guy.
- l swear to God, the camera guy.

23:48.451 --> 23:51.545
Not so much from my reading,
although it had a lot to do with it,

23:51.621 --> 23:53.748
but, really, he had
his own things going on.

23:53.824 --> 23:56.292
So the producer
starts to talk to me.

23:56.359 --> 23:59.157
He says, "Trent, when you
walked in this room,

23:59.229 --> 24:01.994
l didn't see Trent Walker
come in here."

24:02.066 --> 24:05.297
He said, "l saw big brother
come in here." Fuckin' great, right?

24:05.369 --> 24:07.963
He says, "You walked in with the role,
you nailed it, you're great."

24:08.039 --> 24:10.872
- So give me the fuckin' part.
- Exactly. Right?

24:10.942 --> 24:15.846
Then he says to me... He says,
"Trent, l gotta be honest with you.

24:15.914 --> 24:20.010
l think that it might be that
you may be just a little bit old...

24:20.085 --> 24:22.576
for the role of brother."

24:22.654 --> 24:25.179
So l felt confident,
'cause l gave a good read.

24:25.257 --> 24:28.192
l say to him, "Well, how old exactly
is the role of brother?"

24:28.260 --> 24:30.195
- [Mike] Here it comes.
- 'Cause l'm tall.

24:30.263 --> 24:32.697
- Here it comes.
- But l look young, Mike.
Do l look young, girls?

24:32.765 --> 24:34.790
Yeah, you do.

24:34.868 --> 24:37.860
So he says to me... l swear to God he
says this to me with a straight face.

24:37.937 --> 24:42.074
This fucking guy.
"Eleven years old."

24:42.207 --> 24:44.143
- And you said "double down."
- Double down.

24:44.143 --> 24:46.509
Because you know why? Because you
make it happen on the bets.

24:46.579 --> 24:48.513
He's great, isn't he?

24:48.581 --> 24:52.039
But the truth of the matter was,
you saw my picture, you saw my tape.

24:52.118 --> 24:54.916
You know l'm 24 years old.
Why did you call me in?

24:54.987 --> 24:57.683
- Wow.
- That's your great bit.

24:57.757 --> 25:01.524
Well, we all have stories.

25:01.595 --> 25:03.529
- Wow.
- Yup.

25:11.071 --> 25:16.408
Uh, how rude of me. l never...
l never gave you the... the tour.

25:28.624 --> 25:31.559
[Rock]

25:31.627 --> 25:33.561
[Giggles]

25:38.000 --> 25:42.597
Come on home, girl
He said with a smile

25:42.672 --> 25:47.006
You don't have to love me
and let's get high a while

25:47.077 --> 25:51.878
But try to understand
Try to understand

25:51.948 --> 25:54.974
- Ohh
- l'm gonna check on my boy.

25:55.051 --> 25:58.385
Ohh, try

25:58.456 --> 26:00.549
Try to understand

26:00.625 --> 26:04.755
Try, try
Try to understand

26:04.829 --> 26:07.525
He's a magic man

26:13.505 --> 26:15.530
l'm sure she'll call.

26:15.607 --> 26:17.837
l mean, six years
is a long time.

26:17.910 --> 26:21.004
- You don't just break it off
cleanly after six years.
- But she did.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.014
- And she's with somebody else now.
- Already?

26:24.082 --> 26:27.246
- Yeah.
- Oh, you poor thing.

26:27.320 --> 26:30.016
- You know what? lt won't last.
- Why not?

26:30.089 --> 26:34.025
- lt's a rebound.
- We were a rebound
and we lasted for six years.

26:34.093 --> 26:39.326
Well, yeah, but how long was the
relationship she was rebounding from?

26:39.399 --> 26:42.028
Six years.

26:42.102 --> 26:44.536
Uh, can l check
my messages real quick?

26:44.605 --> 26:47.540
- l have a calling card.
lt won't cost anything.
- Yeah.

26:47.608 --> 26:49.872
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, sure. The phone's in the back.

26:49.944 --> 26:52.378
- l'm not ruining tonight, am l?
- No, it's okay.

26:52.446 --> 26:54.539
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Oh, l understand.

26:54.615 --> 26:56.550
- l'm sorry.
- lt's okay.

27:04.192 --> 27:06.126
T.

27:07.195 --> 27:09.130
Trent.

27:10.833 --> 27:13.734
Trent.

27:13.803 --> 27:16.499
l need to, uh, u...

27:16.572 --> 27:21.771
No. l gotta... l gotta use...
l gotta use the phone.

27:21.844 --> 27:25.941
- You can check 'em tomorrow.
- l need to use the phone.

27:26.016 --> 27:28.849
Okay? l'm sorry.

27:28.919 --> 27:30.853
Hold on.

27:33.490 --> 27:36.687
l'm sure l... They weren't
in there that long.

27:36.760 --> 27:39.855
l don't think we're
interrupting anything.

27:41.566 --> 27:44.194
[Exhales]

27:46.771 --> 27:48.705
l have a calling card.

27:48.773 --> 27:52.504
So it's a 800...
it's a 800 number.

28:02.388 --> 28:06.119
- [Dial Tone]
- [Beeping]

28:06.191 --> 28:10.151
- Six years? Oh, poor thing.
- l know.

28:10.230 --> 28:12.164
- And you know what he said?
- What? What?

28:12.232 --> 28:14.166
- And l believe him.
- What?

28:14.234 --> 28:18.170
- He said, "l just want her to be happy."
- He said that?

28:18.238 --> 28:21.071
- lt's so sweet. So sweet.
- That is so sweet.

28:21.141 --> 28:23.508
- Oh.
- l know.

28:23.577 --> 28:26.569
l'll make some coffee.

28:26.647 --> 28:29.343
- [Drapes Being Drawn]
- Mmm.

28:31.319 --> 28:34.186
[Both Chuckle Nervously]

28:46.768 --> 28:49.999
[Women Whispering]

28:50.072 --> 28:51.836
Did she call?

28:53.309 --> 28:57.336
- [Christy] Oh!
- Oh, Mike, l'm so...

28:57.413 --> 29:00.109
Oh, God.

29:00.183 --> 29:03.812
That's so bad. l'm sorry.

29:05.021 --> 29:08.116
[Lisa]
lt's gonna be okay.

29:08.192 --> 29:12.322
She asked me what l was thinking about.
Did you want me to lie?

29:12.396 --> 29:15.490
You didn't have to
get into it, baby.

29:15.566 --> 29:17.659
l'm sorry about
interrupting you guys.

29:17.735 --> 29:21.263
Oh, don't worry about it. l just wanted
you to have a good time, that's all.

29:21.339 --> 29:25.241
- Christy was nice.
- Yeah, l really didn't like
her that much, to be honest.

29:25.310 --> 29:29.269
- Why not?
- l don't know, man. She just...
She didn't really do it for me.

29:29.347 --> 29:34.285
What'd you think of that,
uh, Dorothy girl?

29:34.353 --> 29:37.345
The whole Judy Garland thing
kinda turned me on.

29:37.423 --> 29:41.018
- Does that make me some kind of a fag?
- No, baby, you're money.

29:44.597 --> 29:48.033
- l don't think she liked me anyway.
- Mike, l'm tellin' you, man.

29:48.100 --> 29:51.195
- She thought you were money.
- l don't think so.

29:51.271 --> 29:54.365
l heard 'em both talking.
Both those girls thought you were money.

29:54.441 --> 29:57.035
You're a good friend.

29:58.412 --> 30:01.381
Look, you take yourself
outta the game.

30:01.448 --> 30:04.043
You start talkin' to 'em
about puppy dogs and ice cream,

30:04.118 --> 30:07.315
of course it's going to end up
on the friendship tip.

30:07.388 --> 30:09.322
l just don't think
she liked me in that way.

30:09.390 --> 30:12.154
Baby, you are so money,
and you don't even know it.

30:12.226 --> 30:16.720
Look, T, the girls don't go for me
the way they go for you, okay?

30:16.798 --> 30:19.199
- Michelle went for you, right?
- That's different.

30:19.268 --> 30:22.237
- Why? How is that different?
- We were younger. lt was college.

30:22.304 --> 30:25.239
You didn't go to college.
You don't know how it is.
The girls are young, they drink.

30:25.307 --> 30:29.243
- They don't know any better.
- Do you know how stupid that sounds?

30:29.311 --> 30:34.249
Listen to me. Your self-esteem
is low right now because
she's with somebody else.

30:34.317 --> 30:38.083
But talkin' about it and thinkin' about
it all the time, it's depressing.

30:38.154 --> 30:41.646
lt's no good, man.

30:41.724 --> 30:43.658
l just need
a little more time.

30:43.726 --> 30:46.855
Why, so you can sit around your stuffy
apartment beating yourself up over it?

30:46.931 --> 30:50.697
- Remember the first week
after she told you?
- Don't remind me.

30:50.768 --> 30:54.829
Huh? Couldn't even
leave your place.

30:54.905 --> 30:58.033
You know, you just sat around
your stuffy apartment,

30:58.108 --> 31:01.943
sitting there, drinking orange juice,
feeling sorry for yourself.

31:02.013 --> 31:05.380
Now look at you, man. Right?
l mean, you got a part in a movie.

31:05.450 --> 31:08.044
- A day.
- Whatever, Mike.
lt's work. You understand?

31:08.119 --> 31:12.488
You're doing what you love to do.
What the hell is she doing now?

31:12.557 --> 31:15.549
Selling scrap metal.

31:15.627 --> 31:18.961
Okay. And this guy she's seeing,
what the hell does he do?

31:19.031 --> 31:21.522
- [Mumbling] He drives a carriage.
- What?

31:21.601 --> 31:25.162
l heard he drives a carriage
around Central Park or something.

31:25.238 --> 31:29.174
Oh, Mike, please! You're
the fun-lovin', outgoing party guy,

31:29.242 --> 31:30.978
and you're sweatin'
some lawn jockey.

31:30.978 --> 31:32.172
and you're sweatin'
some lawn jockey.

31:32.245 --> 31:35.214
Jesus Christ!
l'm tellin' you, man.

31:35.282 --> 31:39.013
You're better off without this girl.
You gotta trust me on this, Mike.

31:39.086 --> 31:42.578
- All right, buddy?
- Stop talking. Shut up.

31:42.656 --> 31:46.821
Okay, l'm gonna try. l promise you l
will shut up if you shut the hell up.

31:46.894 --> 31:49.829
- We're gonna make this work.
- You're damn right you're gonna try.

31:49.897 --> 31:52.764
- [Engine Revving]
- Let's get home.

31:52.834 --> 31:57.032
- l'm a man of means by no means
- Los Angeles.

31:57.105 --> 31:59.404
King of the road

31:59.475 --> 32:04.139
l know every engineer
of every train

32:04.213 --> 32:07.512
All their children
and all of their names

32:07.583 --> 32:11.610
And every handout
in every town

32:11.687 --> 32:15.351
Every lock that ain't locked
when no one's around

32:15.525 --> 32:18.460
l seen trailers
for sale or rent

32:18.528 --> 32:20.894
- [Rob] l don't think
l'm gonna take it.
- Look, it's a gig.

32:20.964 --> 32:22.898
This is definitely
a step back for me.

32:22.966 --> 32:25.400
There's not much of a call
for Shakespeare in this town.

32:25.468 --> 32:27.902
There's just something
about being Goofy, all right?

32:27.971 --> 32:31.806
Any other Disney character would
be fine. Mickey? Mickey's an icon.

32:31.876 --> 32:35.243
- Why does it have to be Goofy?
- What do you want? You're tall.

32:35.312 --> 32:37.906
How am l gonna
tell my parents?

32:37.982 --> 32:40.678
l still haven't told them
l didn't get the series.

32:40.751 --> 32:43.243
You tested over a month ago.
l'm sure they figured it out.

32:43.321 --> 32:46.916
lt's like, "Mom, hi.
l didn't get that pilot.

32:46.992 --> 32:50.621
By the way, l'm Goofy.
Send more money."

33:05.411 --> 33:07.845
[Taps Ball]

33:10.216 --> 33:12.151
Hey, Rob.

33:13.587 --> 33:16.613
You notice l didn't
mention her once today.

33:16.690 --> 33:20.319
- l didn't want to say anything.
- Oh, yeah? Why?

33:20.394 --> 33:24.125
Ah, it's kind of like
not talking to your pitcher
in the middle of a no-hitter.

33:24.198 --> 33:27.691
- What do you mean? Like you
didn't want to jinx it?
- Kinda.

33:27.769 --> 33:30.237
- l don't talk about her that much.
- [Laughing]

33:30.305 --> 33:32.739
- l didn't mention her once today.
- Tend the pin.

33:32.807 --> 33:35.901
The only reason l mentioned her
at all was to tell you l'm not
gonna talk about her anymore.

33:35.977 --> 33:38.673
- l thought you'd appreciate that.
- l do. Good for you, Mikey.

33:41.984 --> 33:44.418
- Get there.
- Play it out.

33:44.487 --> 33:48.150
- l decided to get back out there.
- Good. Glad to hear it.

33:48.224 --> 33:51.751
- Can't make any more excuses for myself.
- Excellent.

33:53.596 --> 33:56.430
- [Sighs]
- Do you wanna hit the town tonight?

33:56.500 --> 33:59.663
Uh, l shouldn't.
lt's a weeknight.

33:59.736 --> 34:04.435
- You got a Pluto callback?
- Yeah, kick me when l'm down.

34:04.508 --> 34:07.477
- All right. Count 'em up.
- How many strokes?

34:07.544 --> 34:09.876
One, two, three...

34:14.284 --> 34:16.219
- Eight, nine.
- What'd you get?

34:16.286 --> 34:18.721
- Eight or a nine.
- l'll give you an eight.

34:18.789 --> 34:21.121
- What did you get?
- l got an eight.

34:21.192 --> 34:24.560
Dead heat after one hole.
lt's turning into quite a rivalry.

34:24.630 --> 34:28.157
You better replace the pin, Chi Chi.
The natives look restless.

34:29.868 --> 34:32.063
- [Computer Game]
- [Man] You bitch! You bitch!

34:32.137 --> 34:34.731
- [Trent] Chelios steals to Roenick.
- [All Groaning]

34:34.806 --> 34:37.070
- [Trent] Money!
- Bitch!

34:37.141 --> 34:39.235
[Mike] Sue, why is
Gretzky on his ass again?

34:39.312 --> 34:42.907
- Gretzky's a little bitch.
- God, this is such bullshit, man.
This is bullshit!

34:42.982 --> 34:45.780
[Mike] The Kings suck in this game.
You should play another team.

34:45.851 --> 34:49.253
- l took the Kings to the Cup.
- Yeah, against the computer
with the offsides off.

34:49.322 --> 34:52.416
- They're a finesse team, bro.
- They're a fuckin' bitch team.
Score... Oh!

34:52.492 --> 34:55.087
You bitch!
What a fuckin' bitch!

34:55.161 --> 34:57.221
- Watch out, motherfucker.
- No, you do not fuckin' hit my elbow.

34:57.298 --> 34:59.789

as it's Roenick. He's good.

34:59.867 --> 35:01.732

Oh, is that right?

35:01.802 --> 35:04.270
- Chelios steals to Roenick.
- [Sue] You bitch!

35:04.338 --> 35:06.738
Score Chicago! Ohh!

35:06.807 --> 35:08.742
- That was pretty.
- Such fuckin' bullshit!

35:08.810 --> 35:11.370
But that was pretty, Sue.
Check this out on the instant replay.

35:11.446 --> 35:13.812
- Dude, do not...
- You said it was fuckin' bullshit.
Check it out.

35:13.882 --> 35:16.680
- Look at it!
- [Both Arguing]

35:16.751 --> 35:18.685
- Look at it!
- l don't want to!

35:18.753 --> 35:21.813
Why do you think they put
the instant replay in the fucking game?

35:21.890 --> 35:24.291
- God, you're unbelievable.
- So you can see if it's bullshit.

35:24.360 --> 35:28.160
- l am unbelievable. Look at it.
- Every goal you're gonna watch
the instant replay?

35:28.231 --> 35:30.165
- Come on, man, l want to fuckin' play.
- l want him to learn it.

35:30.233 --> 35:32.224
- l never get to play.
- You should practice this
when l'm not here.

35:32.301 --> 35:34.735
- Just fuckin' move it.
- When l'm not here,
will you practice this?

35:34.804 --> 35:36.897
- Wa, wa, wa, wa.
- We'll play some more.
He likes to get scored on.

35:36.973 --> 35:39.067
- Set the game up.

35:39.142 --> 35:42.578
[Phone Ringing]

35:42.646 --> 35:44.739
- Yeah?
- Better play defense.

35:44.815 --> 35:47.909
Okay. Yeah, it's on the fourth floor.
The elevator's broken, okay?

35:47.985 --> 35:50.419
Dude, it's Pink Dot.
Would you buzz him in? Hit nine.

35:50.487 --> 35:53.252
l wish they still had fights in
this game so l could bitch-slap Wayne.

35:53.324 --> 35:55.656
- They don't have fighting anymore?
- Doesn't that suck?

35:55.727 --> 35:58.059
Why'd they get rid of the fighting?
lt's the best part of the old version.

35:58.129 --> 36:00.154
Kids were hitting each other
or something, man.

36:00.231 --> 36:02.495
But you know what, Mike? You can
make their heads bleed on this one.

36:02.567 --> 36:04.728
- Make somebody's head bleed.
- No, we're in play-offs.

36:04.802 --> 36:08.034
l'm gonna make Wayne Gretzky's head
bleed for super fan number 99 here.

36:08.107 --> 36:10.803
- [Doorbell Rings]
- Mikey, get the door?

36:10.876 --> 36:13.071
- Yeah, give me some money.

36:13.145 --> 36:15.909
Give me some fuckin' money.
l'm not paying again.

36:15.981 --> 36:18.677
Jesus Christ.
Pause the game.

36:18.751 --> 36:21.550

36:23.623 --> 36:27.059
All right, l'll pause it.
Jesus Christ. Like you scored all day.

36:28.561 --> 36:30.722
- How much do you want?
- Just give me some money.

36:30.797 --> 36:34.631
Okay, fine. Take my last 20.
Here. Jesus fucking Christ.

36:36.404 --> 36:39.032
There it is, Mikey! Check it out.
His head's bleeding.

36:39.106 --> 36:42.200
Mikey, check it out. His legs... Little
Wayne's legs are shaking all over.

36:42.276 --> 36:45.643
- Fucking bitch!
What did you do that for?
- You're the fucking bitch!

36:45.713 --> 36:48.910
- What the fuck are you...
Why did you un-pause it?
- Come on, man.

36:48.983 --> 36:51.578
- C'mon, peaches.
- Get the fuck off me.

36:51.653 --> 36:54.247

Look at you. Look at you.

36:54.323 --> 36:56.382

- Get the fuck off me!
- You're fuckin' makin' me sick!
You want to kiss me!

37:01.196 --> 37:05.463
Hey, hold still. Hold on. lt's
the fuckin' Pink Dot guy. Hold on.

37:05.535 --> 37:08.971
[Trent]
Hey, Mikey! Mikey, is he cute?

37:09.038 --> 37:12.064
- [Sue] ls he brown?
- Maybe he'd like to come in
and join us for a cocktail.

37:12.141 --> 37:14.075
- ls he polite?
- ls he a brown man?

37:14.143 --> 37:17.044
lf he's polite, have him come in. lf

37:17.113 --> 37:20.208
Have him come look.
Have him take off his shoes.

37:20.284 --> 37:22.548
Michael, is he clean?
l want to see him!

37:22.619 --> 37:26.453
Michael, l want to see him.
Don't let him go! Don't let him go.

37:26.523 --> 37:29.048
Get off. l'm serious.
Don't fuckin' do that shit.

37:29.126 --> 37:32.391
Oh, he got away from us.
l'm sorry, Michael. Was he nice?

37:32.463 --> 37:37.561
You guys are assholes.
Eat, eat, you fuckin' jackals.

37:37.635 --> 37:39.796
- Oh, yeah.
- Nice.

37:39.871 --> 37:42.237

- lt starts at 8:00.

37:42.307 --> 37:44.901

37:47.245 --> 37:50.943

37:51.016 --> 37:52.950
- Who, Rob?
- Yeah, you know him.

37:53.018 --> 37:55.452
Yeah, he's cool.
You'll like him. He's a rounder, Rob.

37:55.521 --> 37:57.751
- What does he do?
- Uh, he's trying to be an actor.

37:57.823 --> 38:00.087
- What a surprise.
- How novel.

38:00.159 --> 38:03.687
[Rob]
So the party started at 8:00.

38:03.764 --> 38:06.198
Why are we going
to a bar at 10:00?

38:06.266 --> 38:09.793
[Mike] To grab a drink before we meet
the guys for a bite at 11:00.

38:09.870 --> 38:11.804
Where is this place?

38:11.872 --> 38:15.672
For some reason the cool bars
in Hollywood have to be hard
to find and have no sign.

38:15.742 --> 38:18.371
lt's kind of like a speakeasy
kind of thing. lt's kinda cool.

38:18.446 --> 38:21.279
lt's like you're in on some
kind of secret, you know?

38:21.349 --> 38:25.342
You tell a chick you been
someplace, it's like braggin'
that you know how to find it.

38:25.420 --> 38:27.980
[Jazz]

38:28.055 --> 38:31.149
[Continues]

38:35.230 --> 38:40.135

38:40.135 --> 38:42.729
Excuse me.

38:42.804 --> 38:45.602
Excuse me.

38:45.674 --> 38:48.439
Excuse me.

38:52.315 --> 38:55.250
l'll get a Dewars on the rocks.
What are you getting?

38:55.318 --> 38:58.253
- Uh, Budweiser.
- A Dewars on the rocks and a Bud.

38:58.321 --> 39:01.849
God, l can't believe
the women in this city.

39:01.925 --> 39:05.725
lt's like the hottest one percent
from... from all over the world...

39:05.796 --> 39:07.730
come to our gene pool.

39:07.798 --> 39:09.732
Darwinism at its best.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.769
- Yo, Mikey, what's up?
- Charles! How you doin', man?

39:12.836 --> 39:15.328
- Ah, you know, man. You know.
- You get that pilot?

39:15.406 --> 39:18.603
Nah, man. l know you didn't. Otherwise
you wouldn't be askin' me, right?

39:18.676 --> 39:22.043
- That shit wasn't funny anyway.
- Piece of shit.

39:22.113 --> 39:25.480
Charles, this is my friend Rob
from back East. He just moved out here.

39:25.550 --> 39:27.484
- My pleasure.
- How you doin', man?

39:27.552 --> 39:29.885
This is Charles.
We went to network on a pilot.

39:29.955 --> 39:32.219
- Oh, yeah, l tested for one.
- A month ago.

39:32.291 --> 39:35.783
- How'd your folks take it?
- Actually, l haven't heard
an official "no" yet.

39:35.861 --> 39:38.352
Oh, so you haven't
told them yet.

39:38.430 --> 39:41.558
That's all right, man.
l still haven't told my folks
l didn't get Deep Space Nine.

39:41.634 --> 39:43.568
You figure they'd figure
it out by now, right?

39:43.636 --> 39:45.969
- But Moms keeps asking me.
- Boy, does it hurt when they ask.

39:46.039 --> 39:48.269
l don't even tell them about
anything l'm close on anymore.

39:48.341 --> 39:50.571
Not 'til you book it.
You know, you might get cut out.

39:50.644 --> 39:54.307
l'm considering taking
a part as Goofy.

39:54.381 --> 39:57.316
- Well, at least it's Disney, right?
- Yeah.

39:57.384 --> 40:00.411
Look, we're going to, uh,
we're going to this party in the hills.

40:00.488 --> 40:03.548
Some modeling agency. Beautiful babies.
You want to come with?

40:03.624 --> 40:06.286
Yeah, why not?
This place is dead anyway.

40:06.360 --> 40:08.555
Let's go.

40:12.133 --> 40:14.432
No, no, no, no, no.
Now, you got to admit...

40:14.503 --> 40:16.994
that the Steadicam shot
in GoodFellas was the money.

40:17.072 --> 40:20.439
The basement of the... the restaurant,
the Copa in New York.

40:20.509 --> 40:23.444
- Through the kitchen, Mike.
- l heard it took them four days
to light that shot.

40:23.512 --> 40:25.446
[Rob] Four days?
l don't know about four days.

40:25.514 --> 40:27.608
- Well, that's what l heard.
- [Trent] They have
to hide all the lights.

40:27.684 --> 40:29.618
Jesus, that must've
cost a fortune.

40:29.686 --> 40:32.621
[Charles] That's nothing.
You know how much money my man
spent on that Vegas movie?

40:32.689 --> 40:34.623
[Mike] Wait. You gotta be nuts
to shoot in a casino.

40:34.691 --> 40:36.784
[Trent]
All right, ready. Mean Streets?

40:36.859 --> 40:40.022
- That's the dope.
- Dude, dude. Reservoir Dogs.

40:40.096 --> 40:42.122
- Oh, stop with that
fucking Reservoir Dogs.
- Which one?

40:42.199 --> 40:44.759
The one right in the beginning where
they're walking in slow motion, man.

40:44.835 --> 40:46.962
How can you even
compare the two, man?

40:47.037 --> 40:49.631
Tarantino completely bites
everything from Scorsese.

40:49.707 --> 40:51.641
- lt's true.
- He's derivative.

40:51.709 --> 40:53.973
[Trent] You know what?
You gotta admit that did look money.

40:54.044 --> 40:57.105
[Charles] l heard they did
that whole thing for under ten grand.

40:57.182 --> 40:59.309
l don't know what the big deal is.
Everybody steals from everybody.
That's movies.

40:59.384 --> 41:01.477
[Mike] Let's get the hell out
of here if we wanna make this party.

41:41.829 --> 41:44.127
Pick up the pieces
Uh-huh

41:44.198 --> 41:46.223

41:48.603 --> 41:50.764

42:16.166 --> 42:18.100

42:43.795 --> 42:46.286
Pick up the pieces

42:48.467 --> 42:51.561
Pick up the pieces

42:51.636 --> 42:55.835

43:01.647 --> 43:03.842
[Ends]

43:03.916 --> 43:06.977
Uhh
Oh, suki, suki

43:08.756 --> 43:12.920
Hey
Uhh, come on

43:12.993 --> 43:17.259

43:17.331 --> 43:19.765

- Damned if l know.

43:19.833 --> 43:22.428
- Beats me.
- Hey, l came with you.

43:22.504 --> 43:24.563
Nice.

43:24.639 --> 43:27.767
- [Man] Sue!
- What's that guy's name again? Sue?

43:27.842 --> 43:31.243
Sue. Yeah. His dad was a big Johnny Cash
fan from what l understand.

43:31.312 --> 43:33.906
- Oh, right, right, right. The song.
- Yeah, "A Boy Named Sue."

43:33.982 --> 43:36.850
So l think that's why
he's such a mean cat.

43:36.919 --> 43:38.853
- That guy?
- Oh, he's a bad guy.

43:38.921 --> 43:41.617
He don't look it. He's... No, he's mean.
l seen him in a fight once.

43:41.690 --> 43:45.285
He had a guy and was fuckin' smackin'
his head into the curb, like his mouth.

43:45.361 --> 43:48.797
Just fuckin' smash. His teeth came out.
Just fucking, wha, wha, wha.

43:48.864 --> 43:51.629
Fuckin' blood came out of
his fuckin' mouth. lt was nasty, man.

43:51.701 --> 43:54.329
- Nice guy, though. That guy's cool.
- Hey, big Mike.

43:54.404 --> 43:57.339
Hey, how're you doing?

43:57.407 --> 43:59.739

What about now?
ls she looking now?

44:19.665 --> 44:22.429
No, she's not looking at you, dude.
Will you quit asking me
if she's looking at you?

44:22.501 --> 44:26.767
- She hasn't looked at you...
Wait, she just looked.
- See what l'm sayin', man?

44:26.839 --> 44:29.831
You understand?

44:29.908 --> 44:32.274

44:46.359 --> 44:49.454
- Unbelievable.

44:49.530 --> 44:51.623

44:51.699 --> 44:53.633

- Go. Go for it.

44:53.701 --> 44:56.295

or later, right? So l gotta go now.

44:56.370 --> 44:59.464
- Okay, you're gonna be my wing man?

45:14.222 --> 45:16.588
Hi. Uh, how are you ladies

45:18.294 --> 45:20.785
What do you drive?

45:20.863 --> 45:23.093
E-Excuse me?

45:23.165 --> 45:26.430
What kind of a car

45:50.361 --> 45:52.295

45:52.363 --> 45:55.628

45:58.536 --> 46:01.472

46:08.814 --> 46:11.078
- Not well.
- What, rejected?

46:11.150 --> 46:13.084
"Shaqued."

46:13.152 --> 46:15.917
Just watch old T-bone
there and learn.

46:15.989 --> 46:20.461
She's a brick house

46:20.594 --> 46:24.665
My whole life people have told me
l have this star quality.

46:24.665 --> 46:27.099
- Have they?
- Well, l don't know if it's true.

46:27.167 --> 46:29.761
But, well, this one time...
this is really stupid...

46:29.837 --> 46:32.170
- But in kindergarten, you know...
- lt's all right.

46:32.240 --> 46:35.607
You know how you have those
little crushes? l had
this crush on this guy Lee.

46:35.677 --> 46:39.408
He was really cute, and he
wore Lee Jeans. They said "Lee."

46:39.481 --> 46:42.416
Anyway, l really liked him.
And then one day he told me l was ugly.

46:42.484 --> 46:45.943
l started crying,
and my teacher was, like,

46:46.021 --> 46:49.115
"Deidre, you are so emotional.
You are so dramatic.

46:49.191 --> 46:51.421
You should be an actress!"

46:51.494 --> 46:54.588
- ["Jaws Theme"]
- lt was, like, that's it!
l should be an actress.

46:54.663 --> 46:57.291

47:28.333 --> 47:30.494
Why, baby?

l'm part of the whole Vegas circuits.

51:44.273 --> 51:48.505

l worked for it. Why not?

- lt was about two weeks ago.
- lt was probably more.

52:21.379 --> 52:24.143
Probably longer, 'cause things
have been going very well lately.

52:24.216 --> 52:26.150
l haven't been looking
for a job in a while.

52:26.218 --> 52:28.982
lt could have been someone who
looks like me, 'cause there's
a lot of people who look kinda...

52:29.054 --> 52:32.717
- See, l have a face that's similar...
- You better pay the man.

52:32.791 --> 52:36.922

- We got digits, baby.
- Yeah, what a surprise.

52:50.344 --> 52:52.835
What's wrong with you? l saw you
talkin' to a beautiful brunette baby.

52:52.913 --> 52:55.347
She didn't like me, okay?
l made a fool of myself.

52:55.415 --> 52:58.851
- Baby, don't talk that way.
- You're so money, and you
don't even know it.

52:58.919 --> 53:02.447
- That's what l keep tryin' to tell him.
- Could you not mess with me?

53:02.523 --> 53:05.390
- Baby, we're not messing with you.
- We're not.

53:05.460 --> 53:08.793
You know what you are? You're like
a big bear with claws and fangs, man.

53:08.863 --> 53:11.457
- Big fuckin' teeth, man.
- Yeah, big fuckin' teeth on ya.

53:11.532 --> 53:14.797
She's just like this little bunny who's
just kinda cowering in the corner.

53:14.869 --> 53:17.805
- [Sue] Shivering.
- Yeah, man, just kinda...

53:17.873 --> 53:20.808
You got these claws and
you're staring at these claws,
and you're thinkin' to yourself,

53:20.876 --> 53:23.572
with these claws, you're thinkin', "How
am l supposed to kill this bunny?"

53:23.646 --> 53:25.580
You're pokin' at it, man.

53:25.648 --> 53:28.250
You're not hurtin' it. You're just
kinda gently battin' the bunny around.

53:28.383 --> 53:31.354
You know what l mean?
And the bunny's scared of you.

53:31.354 --> 53:33.288
- And it's shivering.
- You got the fucking claws!

53:33.356 --> 53:36.814
These claws and these fangs! You're
looking at your claws and your fangs.

53:36.892 --> 53:39.486
You're thinking to yourself,
"l don't know what to do, man.

53:39.562 --> 53:43.328
l don't know how to kill the bunny."
With this, you don't know how
to kill the bunny!

53:43.399 --> 53:45.994
You're like
a big bear, man.

53:46.069 --> 53:48.833
- So you're not just fuckin' with me?
- No, l'm not fucking with you!

53:48.905 --> 53:50.839
- Honestly!
- Mike, l'm telling you, you're money.

53:50.907 --> 53:52.841
You're so fucking money.

53:52.909 --> 53:55.173
l want you to go over to that girl
and l want you to get those digits.

53:55.245 --> 53:57.179
- You're money.
- Come here a second. Listen to me.

53:57.247 --> 53:59.841
Look it, when you go up
to talk to her, man,

53:59.916 --> 54:05.014
l don't want you to be the guy
in the PG-13 movie everyone's
really hoping makes it happen.

54:05.089 --> 54:08.183
l want you to be like the guy
in the rated R movie, you know?

54:08.259 --> 54:10.625
The guy you're not sure
whether or not you like yet.

54:10.695 --> 54:13.129
You're not sure where he's coming
from, okay? You're a bad man.

54:13.197 --> 54:15.462
You're a bad man.
You're a bad man.

it's not that hard.

Nice.

55:07.589 --> 55:10.080

- A day.

55:10.158 --> 55:12.558
- Tomorrow.
- Mm-mmm.

55:12.628 --> 55:14.562
- Tomorrow, then a day.
- Yeah.

55:14.630 --> 55:17.622
- So two days.
- Yeah, l guess you could
call it that... two days.

55:17.700 --> 55:20.134
Definitely. Two days
is like industry standard.

55:20.203 --> 55:24.867
l used to wait two days to
call anybody, but now it's like
everyone in town waits two days.

55:24.941 --> 55:26.932
So l think three days is kinda money.
What do you think?

55:27.009 --> 55:29.808
- Two's enough not to look anxious.
- Two's enough not to look anxious.

55:29.880 --> 55:32.075
But l think three days
is kinda money.

55:32.149 --> 55:34.083
Maybe l'll wait three weeks.
How's that?

55:34.151 --> 55:36.483
And tell her l was cleaning out
my wallet and l just happened
to run into her number.

55:36.553 --> 55:38.487
- Then ask her where you met her.
- Yeah.

55:38.555 --> 55:41.319
l don't remember. What does she look
like? Then l'll ask if we fucked.

55:41.392 --> 55:43.657
Would that...
T, would that be the money?

55:43.728 --> 55:45.821
You know what? Ha, ha, ha, Mike.
Laugh all you want.

55:45.897 --> 55:51.233
But if you call too soon,
you might scare off a nice baby
who's ready to party.

55:51.302 --> 55:55.636
- How long are you guys gonna
wait to call your babies?
- [Together] Six days.

Hi, uh, Nikki,
this is Mike again.

01:00:40.211 --> 01:00:43.146

You're telling me that your life sucks.
That means mine is god-awful.

is l saw how well you were doing,

make it, l could too.

- You got an agent.

the things that you have.

lt's like...

You wake up every day,
it hurts a little bit less,

01:08:59.944 --> 01:09:03.073

and it doesn't hurt at all.

that you miss her.

Well, exactly, it's like,
you know, you, uh, have com...

01:18:08.196 --> 01:18:13.225
lf you meet a girl in a bar and

01:18:13.302 --> 01:18:15.202
What else?

01:18:15.271 --> 01:18:17.705

You grow, go out, anything.

01:18:20.943 --> 01:18:24.174
Like, if l met a handsome
young man at a bar,

01:18:24.246 --> 01:18:26.545
l could just ask him to dance?

01:18:26.616 --> 01:18:29.710
lf the guy wanted to, yeah.

01:18:29.786 --> 01:18:31.754

Oh, yeah... No, l mean, he would
want to with you. Sure. l mean, if he...

01:18:36.827 --> 01:18:40.355
Sure. M-M-Maybe it's just that
he doesn't feel like dancing.

Would you dance with me?

01:18:44.468 --> 01:18:46.402

01:30:00.356 --> 01:30:02.621
Th-That's his name, Pierre?
What, is he French?

01:30:02.692 --> 01:30:06.788
No, he's not. Listen,

So l heard you might be

Yeah, l don't think that's

Um, can l call you right back?

01:30:36.094 --> 01:30:40.497
Um, well, l'm going out of town

01:31:06.427 --> 01:31:08.861
You know, l really could...
could've called you back, but...

01:31:08.929 --> 01:31:12.296
Anyway, l probably should have waited
two days. That's what my friends said.

01:31:12.366 --> 01:31:15.131
But... God, l sound like
such a schoolgirl. lt's just,
they have this thing, okay?

01:31:15.203 --> 01:31:17.137
lt's at The Room.
lt's Sinatra's birthday.

01:31:17.205 --> 01:31:20.697
And it's one of these Hollywood clubs
and there's no sign.

01:31:20.775 --> 01:31:23.642
Uh, l don't understand why...
why they don't have any signs.

01:31:23.712 --> 01:31:26.146
lt's just
l'm really bad at this.

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:30.652
l just want to know
if you might want to go with me.

01:31:32.888 --> 01:31:36.153
- [Trent] So, uh, you
hung up on which one?
- [Mike] Michelle.

01:31:36.225 --> 01:31:38.716
- You hung up with your girlfriend.
- Ex.

01:31:38.794 --> 01:31:41.092
- Oh, now she's your ex.
- She was always my ex.

01:31:41.163 --> 01:31:43.097
Yeah, right.

01:31:44.935 --> 01:31:49.531
- You hung up with her?
- l wanted to take the other call.

01:31:49.606 --> 01:31:52.074
- What'd she say when
you called her back?
- l didn't.

01:31:54.845 --> 01:31:58.508
- You didn't call her back?
- No.

01:31:58.583 --> 01:32:02.747
- Why not, Mike?
- lt didn't occur to me.

01:32:04.589 --> 01:32:06.523
Didn't occur to you.

01:32:06.591 --> 01:32:09.219
lt didn't.

01:32:09.293 --> 01:32:14.061
You been, uh, tearing yourself
up about this girl for six months.

01:32:15.134 --> 01:32:17.068
Didn't occur to you?

01:32:18.837 --> 01:32:21.237
No.

01:32:23.542 --> 01:32:26.375
Well, Michael, l'll bite.

01:32:28.982 --> 01:32:33.749
You know, man, l didn't understand
it either. lt's all so hard.

01:32:33.820 --> 01:32:37.153
Then it hit me on the way over here,
you know, like a ton of bricks.

01:32:37.223 --> 01:32:39.157
lt's just so simple.

01:32:39.225 --> 01:32:41.819
- When you...
- Dude, dude, wait a second.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.992
l'm getting vibe like
in a really weird way here.

01:32:50.838 --> 01:32:53.966
This girl's looking at me
like she knows me a little bit.

01:32:54.041 --> 01:32:56.066
- You don't recognize her?
- Mike, l don't know.

01:32:56.143 --> 01:32:59.170
l could've been out with Sue
one night drinking and told her
l was a race car driver.

01:32:59.247 --> 01:33:02.876
No, l think l would
remember this girl.

01:33:02.951 --> 01:33:07.354
l don't think l've ever met her before.
l would definitely remember this one.

01:33:07.422 --> 01:33:11.257
She got a lot of confidence, man.
She's doing like...

01:33:11.327 --> 01:33:14.785
- Wow. [Laughs]
- What's going...

01:33:14.864 --> 01:33:17.162
Mike, stop, stop.
Stop, all right? Just stop.

01:33:17.233 --> 01:33:19.633
She's playing a little game,
like a fun thing with me.

01:33:19.702 --> 01:33:23.468
Come on, you little party girl.
That's it. Come on. Fun little games?

01:33:23.539 --> 01:33:27.203
You want to play fun little games? Come
on, you nasty little, cute little baby.

01:33:27.277 --> 01:33:31.145
- What are you doing?
- Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike.
Stop. Don't. Don't, don't.

01:33:31.215 --> 01:33:33.979
She's smiling at me.
She's playing fun little baby games.

01:33:34.051 --> 01:33:37.145
She don't know me. She doesn't
know my address. You know my address?

01:33:37.221 --> 01:33:40.157
You little...
Oh, you... Hold on.

01:33:40.225 --> 01:33:43.160
She's coming over, dude.
Play it cool. She's coming over.

01:33:43.228 --> 01:33:46.857
She's like the wild loony.
But l threw, like, the great
vibe at her, the funny vibe.

01:33:46.931 --> 01:33:49.058
- You'll see.
- [Babbling]

01:33:49.134 --> 01:33:52.160
- Shit.
- Mommy's big boy.

01:33:52.237 --> 01:33:55.105
We're going bye-bye now.
Yes, we're going bye-bye.

01:33:55.174 --> 01:33:58.837
We're gonna go home,
gonna play with Daddy.

01:34:07.019 --> 01:34:10.786
So, um, so you
called her up, right?

01:34:10.857 --> 01:34:13.792
Or you didn't call her. Why didn't you
call her? You said you didn't call her.

01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:16.246
Why didn't you call her? Mike?

01:34:16.379 --> 01:34:18.014
Mike?

01:34:18.014 --> 01:34:21.040
l never cared much
for moonlit skies

01:34:21.117 --> 01:34:24.485
Never winked back
at fireflies

01:34:24.554 --> 01:34:27.751
But now that the stars
are in your eyes

01:34:27.824 --> 01:34:31.123
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

01:34:31.194 --> 01:34:35.358
And l never went in
for afterglow

01:34:35.432 --> 01:34:38.800
Or candlelight
on the mistletoe

01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:41.930
But now when you turn
the lamp down low

01:34:42.006 --> 01:34:45.772
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

01:34:45.843 --> 01:34:49.836
l used to ramble
through the park

01:34:49.914 --> 01:34:53.351
Shadowboxin' in the dark

01:34:53.419 --> 01:34:56.286
Then you came
and caused the spark

01:34:56.355 --> 01:35:00.382
That's a four-alarm fire now

01:35:00.459 --> 01:35:03.360
l never made love
by lantern shine

01:35:03.429 --> 01:35:07.126
l never saw rainbows
in my wine

01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:10.533
But now that your lips
are burnin' mine

01:35:10.603 --> 01:35:14.095
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

01:35:14.174 --> 01:35:17.803
l never cared much
for moonlit skies

01:35:17.877 --> 01:35:21.005
l never winked back
at fireflies

01:35:21.081 --> 01:35:24.540
But now that the stars
are in your eyes

01:35:24.618 --> 01:35:27.985
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

01:35:28.055 --> 01:35:31.650
And l never went in
for afterglow

01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:35.456
Or candlelight
on the mistletoe

01:35:35.529 --> 01:35:38.590
But now when you turn
the lamp down low

01:35:38.667 --> 01:35:42.068
l'm beginnin'
to see the light

01:35:42.137 --> 01:35:46.403
You know, l used to ramble
through the park

01:35:46.475 --> 01:35:50.036
Shadowboxin' in the dark

01:35:50.112 --> 01:35:53.139
Then you came
and lit that spark

01:35:53.216 --> 01:35:56.242
That's a four-alarm fire now

01:35:56.319 --> 01:36:00.312
And l never made love
by lantern shine

01:36:00.389 --> 01:36:04.018
Never saw rainbows
in my wine

01:36:04.093 --> 01:36:07.120
But now that your lips
are burnin' mine

01:36:07.197 --> 01:36:09.825
l'm beginnin'

01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:13.199
Mm, to see the light
