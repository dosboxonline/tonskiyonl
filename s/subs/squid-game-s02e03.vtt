00:25.567 --> 00:27.360
Do you think Mr. Seong will be okay?

00:27.444 --> 00:29.154
What if they already did something to him?

00:29.237 --> 00:32.407
They wouldn't have brought him this far
if they wanted to kill him.

00:32.490 --> 00:35.910
Do you think they've taken him
to the island where they play the games?

00:36.494 --> 00:39.456
I'm not sure, but it seems likely.

00:39.539 --> 00:43.126
If I recall,
the island was somewhere in this area.

00:43.209 --> 00:47.047
"If we fail to capture the Front Man,
we infiltrate the island."

00:47.130 --> 00:50.091
That was Mr. Seong's plan B.
It's going according to plan.

00:50.175 --> 00:53.344
Once the games begin,
Mr. Seong's life may be in danger.

00:53.428 --> 00:54.888
We must find him before it's too late.

00:54.971 --> 00:59.100
If I catch those bastards,
I'm going to electrocute their asses.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.145
All right!

01:02.228 --> 01:03.897
If everyone's aboard, let's go!

01:28.171 --> 01:32.008
SQUID GAME 2

01:34.761 --> 01:39.099
EPISODE 3
001

02:43.913 --> 02:45.290
Player 456.

02:47.417 --> 02:51.963
I sense you're holding on to many things.
You can't leave or stay.

02:53.631 --> 02:56.759
You can't fight it. It's your destiny.

02:58.344 --> 03:02.015
You have souls hovering over your head
who are lingering in this world.

03:02.724 --> 03:06.686
You're not here of your own will.
Those vengeful souls brought you.

03:08.271 --> 03:10.899
If we get out of here,
let me perform a ritual.

03:11.566 --> 03:14.944
I can get rid of all your bad karma.

03:33.129 --> 03:37.133
I would like to extend
a hearty welcome to all of you.

03:37.217 --> 03:42.263
Everyone here will participate
in six different games over six days.

03:42.347 --> 03:47.143
Those who win all six games
will receive a handsome cash prize.

03:48.269 --> 03:49.145
Excuse me.

03:53.900 --> 03:58.363
You said I'd be playing games,
but you practically kidnapped me.

03:58.446 --> 03:59.948
So how can I believe that?

04:01.282 --> 04:04.494
I apologize.
Please understand that it was necessary

04:04.577 --> 04:07.330
to maintain the game's security.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.749
What's with the mask then?

04:10.667 --> 04:12.627
Is your face also a secret?

04:13.503 --> 04:16.714
Yeah! Why are you hiding your face?

04:16.798 --> 04:19.968
Is this some kind of
illegal gambling house?

04:20.051 --> 04:22.971
Even the dealers don't cover their faces
in those places.

04:26.015 --> 04:29.018
To ensure fair gameplay
and confidentiality,

04:29.102 --> 04:33.564
it is our policy not to reveal
the faces and identities of staff.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.024
Please understand.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.485
Did you take off my clothes
and put these on me?

04:37.568 --> 04:38.903
What's with these shoes?

04:39.904 --> 04:42.573
My shoes are limited fucking edition.

04:43.449 --> 04:44.701
They're hard to find!

04:44.784 --> 04:47.620
You going to replace them
if they get ruined?

04:47.704 --> 04:51.207
These don't fit and the color sucks.

04:53.042 --> 04:55.378
Can I just have
what you're wearing instead?

04:56.379 --> 04:57.672
I like pink.

04:59.215 --> 05:02.010
I'm sorry, but that is not possible.

05:02.593 --> 05:05.513
You must be in your uniforms
for the games.

05:05.596 --> 05:06.806
What about my phone?

05:08.349 --> 05:11.811
Why did you take my phone and wallet?
Give them back, please.

05:11.894 --> 05:15.023
We're keeping your belongings safe.

05:15.106 --> 05:17.608
We'll return them once the games are over.

05:17.692 --> 05:21.404
At least give me my phone.
I need to check the crypto market.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.781
If I lose money, will you compensate me?

05:23.865 --> 05:26.617
We will return it to you
once the games are over.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.162
I need to monitor the real-time prices!

05:29.996 --> 05:31.998
Do you know how much I've invested?

05:32.582 --> 05:34.876
Player 333, Lee Myung-gi.

05:38.504 --> 05:42.091
Age 30, used to run a YouTube channel
called MG Coin.

05:42.175 --> 05:45.678
After convincing subscribers to invest
in a new crypto coin called Dalmatian,

05:45.762 --> 05:48.181
causing losses
of approximately 15.2 billion won,

05:48.264 --> 05:50.183
you shut down and disappeared.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.643
You're wanted for fraud

05:52.727 --> 05:55.229
and for violating telecom
and financial investment laws.

05:55.313 --> 05:57.732
Current debt levels, 1.8 billion won.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.818
Player 196, Kang Mi-na,
45 million won in debt.

06:00.902 --> 06:03.905
Player 120, Cho Hyun-ju,
330 million won in debt.

06:04.614 --> 06:08.076
Player 230, Choi Su-bong,
1.19 billion won in debt.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.828
Player 198, Jang do-yeong,
1.4 billion won in debt.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.331
Player 226, Kim Yeong-sam,
1.9 billion won in debt.

06:13.414 --> 06:16.459
Player 444, Kim Nam-du,
2.02 billion won in debt.

06:16.542 --> 06:19.295
Player 343, Sim Jae-seok,
2.89 billion won in debt.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.339
Player 006, Park Mi-hwa,
3.1 billion won in debt.

06:21.422 --> 06:24.050
Player 283, Lee Eun-ju,
4.02 billion won in debt.

06:24.133 --> 06:25.802
Player 100, Im Jeong-dae,

06:26.469 --> 06:27.804
ten billion won in debt.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.098
One more game!

06:30.807 --> 06:32.517
Ten billion? Who's that?

06:32.600 --> 06:33.518
Who is it?

06:34.435 --> 06:35.436
What are you looking at?

06:36.145 --> 06:38.481
Do you think it's easy
to get a ten-billion-won loan?

06:38.564 --> 06:41.109
They don't lend
that kind of money to just anyone!

06:41.192 --> 06:43.736
Only to those
who are capable of paying it back.

06:46.322 --> 06:49.242
All of you in this room

06:49.325 --> 06:51.536
have crippling debts

06:51.619 --> 06:54.580
and are now on a cliff-edge.

06:54.664 --> 06:59.210
When we first came to you,
you did not trust us either.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.629
But as you know, we played a game

07:01.712 --> 07:04.882
and gave you money as promised.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.843
And so you trusted us

07:06.926 --> 07:12.056
and volunteered to participate
according to your own free will.

07:12.140 --> 07:15.768
You have one last chance to decide.

07:15.852 --> 07:20.273
Do you want to live like a piece of trash,
running from creditors?

07:20.356 --> 07:24.610
Or will you seize
the last opportunity we are offering?

07:30.491 --> 07:31.325
Getting closer.

07:33.494 --> 07:35.746
I think it's one of those islands ahead.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.462
Captain, let's pick up the speed.

07:42.545 --> 07:44.213
Sure, as you wish.

07:55.808 --> 07:57.226
What you see now

07:57.310 --> 08:01.439
is the piggy bank where
your valuable prize money will be stored.

08:01.522 --> 08:04.901
After each of the six games you will play,

08:04.984 --> 08:08.988
the prize money will accumulate
in this piggy bank.

08:13.784 --> 08:15.536
How much is the prize money?

08:15.620 --> 08:19.499
The prize money for the games
is 45.6 billion won in total.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.626
45.6 billion won?

08:22.210 --> 08:23.794
And one of us will get it?

08:23.878 --> 08:25.880
We will give you the details

08:25.963 --> 08:28.966
about the distribution of the prize money
after the first game.

08:29.050 --> 08:33.888
For these games,
you will be given a special new advantage.

08:33.971 --> 08:35.014
What is it?

08:35.932 --> 08:38.476
After each game,
you will be given a chance

08:38.559 --> 08:42.480
to vote on whether
to continue the games or not.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.191
If the majority votes to stop the games,

08:45.274 --> 08:50.321
you can leave with the prize money
accumulated up to that point.

08:51.948 --> 08:52.782
Are you saying

08:53.950 --> 08:58.663
we'll still receive the money,
even if we leave after the first game?

09:00.790 --> 09:01.958
That is correct.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.349
Good heavens. Excuse me.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.018
You idiot!

09:21.102 --> 09:24.272
Mom! Whatâ€¦ What are you doing here?

09:24.355 --> 09:27.733
That's what I wanted to ask you!
What are you doing here?

09:27.817 --> 09:28.943
You're embarrassing me.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.027
Embarrassing?

09:30.111 --> 09:32.738
If you knew what was embarrassing,
you wouldn't be here!

09:32.822 --> 09:35.241
Stop it! We'll talk about this later.

09:35.324 --> 09:38.744
No, we won't. Come on, you're leaving.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.621
You're leaving now, okay?

09:40.705 --> 09:42.081
Mom, why did you come here?

09:42.164 --> 09:45.042
Do you realize where you are?
This is no place for an old lady!

09:45.126 --> 09:47.169
Why did I come here?

09:47.712 --> 09:51.132
To pay off your debt, of course!
Do you even have to ask?

09:51.757 --> 09:53.217
You fool.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.178
Why would you bring
a naive old woman here?

09:56.262 --> 09:59.765
Will you take responsibility
if my mom collapses?

09:59.849 --> 10:02.977
Yong-sik, I'll stay and do this.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.062
You go home.

10:05.146 --> 10:08.190
Stop it! I'm already here.
I can't just leave.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.443
But you promised me.

10:10.985 --> 10:13.279
You promised never to gamble again!

10:13.362 --> 10:17.408
No, this isn't gambling.
We're just playing games here.

10:17.491 --> 10:20.036
I'll just play one game and go.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.996
You idiot, it's the same thing.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.498
-Be quiet! That's enough!
-Don't you dare.

10:24.582 --> 10:29.086
-Are you kidding me?
-They're just games! Right, everyone?

10:29.170 --> 10:34.342
If you wish to participate in the games,
please sign the player consent form.

10:34.425 --> 10:38.888
Those who do not wish to participate,
please speak up now.

10:38.971 --> 10:43.309
We always give you a chance
to leave the games.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.228
You'll really pay us
even if we play just one game?

10:50.191 --> 10:53.027
Mom, you can't play any games.
Just go home!

10:53.110 --> 10:55.029
If you're not leaving, neither am I.

10:55.112 --> 10:58.240
-I'm not going anywhere without you.
-Will you hurry up?

11:10.378 --> 11:13.714
The amazing Myung-gi from MG Coin?
Is that you?

11:16.425 --> 11:17.259
Who are you?

11:17.343 --> 11:21.180
You may not know me, but I know you.
MG Coin.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.641
I was subscribed to your channel.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.143
And I lost a shitload of money, asshole.

11:26.227 --> 11:27.520
So did I.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.689
You've got the wrong person.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.234
I watched your content all day, every day.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.028
Now I even see you in my dreams,
motherfucker.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.491
-Was your name Nam-su?
-It's Nam-gyu.

11:40.574 --> 11:41.867
-From Club Pentagon.
-Right.

11:42.743 --> 11:46.122
Thanks to you,
I bonded quickly with Nam-gyu here.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.958
Because we shared the same pain.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.963
I thought the sons of bitches
who made that coin

11:54.046 --> 11:56.090
fled to the Philippines with the money.

11:57.049 --> 12:00.344
So why are you here?
Did they cut you loose?

12:00.428 --> 12:02.346
What do you want from me?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.891
What do you think? Give me my money.

12:05.975 --> 12:08.978
Did I force you to buy that coin?

12:09.061 --> 12:11.564
You told us to bet it all, you fucker.

12:12.273 --> 12:13.733
You swore it'd shoot up.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.653
You said we'd be fucking idiots
if we didn't buy it!

12:18.988 --> 12:23.576
"You are responsible for
the final decision on your investment."

12:24.410 --> 12:26.829
Didn't you hear me say that at the end?

12:27.580 --> 12:28.998
You said you watched every day.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.752
-Hey, calm down!
-You asshole.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.087
-All right now!
-Get off me.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.422
Let go of me.

12:38.048 --> 12:39.133
People are watching.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.843
You don't want to be on the news.

12:47.099 --> 12:51.562
You'd better do well
because I'm coming to get my money back.

12:52.855 --> 12:53.981
Come on.

13:15.711 --> 13:16.712
PLAYER CONSENT FORM

13:16.796 --> 13:18.631
1. A PLAYER IS NOT ALLOWED
TO VOLUNTARILY QUIT THE GAMES

13:18.714 --> 13:20.466
2. A PLAYER WHO REFUSES TO PLAY

13:20.549 --> 13:22.468
3. THE GAMES MAY BE TERMINATED
UPON A MAJORITY VOTE

13:22.551 --> 13:24.261

4. IF THE GAMES ARE TERMINATED,
PLAYERS WILL DIVIDE THE PRIZE EQUALLY

13:26.597 --> 13:27.598
SIGNATURE

13:28.849 --> 13:30.810
Those who do not wish to participate,

13:30.893 --> 13:33.604
please speak up now.

13:46.784 --> 13:48.953
SEONG GI-HUN

13:49.036 --> 13:53.374
A man shouldn't go back on his word.
You said you were giving up.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.751
I'm sorry.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.462
It was urgent,
and you were the only person I could call.

14:00.005 --> 14:03.551
You showed up out of the blue
with those men in black.

14:03.634 --> 14:05.344
What the hell is going on?

14:05.427 --> 14:08.430
In case you've forgotten,
I'm the captain of this boat.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.433
Tell me what the situation is.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.853
I got a lead on where the island is.

14:15.771 --> 14:16.814
And what is it?

14:16.897 --> 14:18.983
I found someone who played the games.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.653
-Really?
-Yes.

14:22.736 --> 14:25.072
But it looks like
he's been taken back there.

14:26.782 --> 14:28.325
We're tracking his location.

14:29.326 --> 14:30.411
Detective Hwang!

14:30.995 --> 14:34.039
My device is telling me
it's that island over there!

14:34.123 --> 14:35.499
Are you familiar with it?

14:35.583 --> 14:38.586
Yeah, people used to live there.

14:38.669 --> 14:42.172
Nowadays, people just go there to fish
from time to time.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.677
It seems like it may be the right place.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.096
If it is, there should be
roads for vehicles

14:49.179 --> 14:51.348
and facilities like a helicopter pad.

14:51.432 --> 14:52.725
I'll fly the drone over and see.

14:52.808 --> 14:55.352
You should go ashore
and follow the tracker.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.314
Okay. Listen up! Get ready to disembark!

14:58.397 --> 15:02.443
The first game will begin momentarily.

15:02.526 --> 15:03.444
Smile.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.530
After having your picture taken,

15:06.614 --> 15:11.327
follow the staff's instructions
and proceed to the game site.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.870
You're Thanos, the rapper.

15:13.829 --> 15:14.830
Oh, shit.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.457
Please look into the camera.

15:16.540 --> 15:19.543
I'm gonna kill half of humanity
With my raps, bam

15:20.336 --> 15:22.796
The runner-up
of The Rap Battleground final.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.551
I'm Gyeong-su, big fan.
I've been to several of your concerts.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.219
Please take a picture with me.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.263
-Me too!
-Me too!

15:31.347 --> 15:33.223
Hang on, guys!

15:33.307 --> 15:36.477
Let's make this easier on Thanos
and take one picture together.

15:36.560 --> 15:37.645
Would that be okay?

15:39.021 --> 15:42.566
-All right, let's get together.
-It's Thanos!

15:42.650 --> 15:46.195
Hey, I don't mind
having one more person. Come on.

15:46.278 --> 15:47.154
Smile.

15:50.324 --> 15:51.742
Are we all in the shot?

15:51.825 --> 15:53.494
You are not allowed to do this.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.122
You want to be in the picture? Come on.

15:57.206 --> 15:59.583
You must take your photos one by one.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.752
Come on, can't you make an exception?

16:01.835 --> 16:04.421
You took our phones,
and we can't take any pictures.

16:05.005 --> 16:05.923
No.

16:08.884 --> 16:12.972
When we get out of here,
I'll take a picture with each of you.

16:13.055 --> 16:16.016
-Okay. Guys, let's go.
-All right! Sweet!

16:20.396 --> 16:22.147
Please look into the camera.

16:22.815 --> 16:23.816
Smile.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.081
Is that a man or a woman?

16:39.164 --> 16:40.666
There are people like that.

16:40.749 --> 16:44.253
They're men who want to be women.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.506
Why would they want to be women?

16:47.589 --> 16:49.383
Men are men, and women are women.

16:49.466 --> 16:51.010
You can't say things like that.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.845
Good grief, that's unsightly.

16:56.765 --> 16:58.767
Please look into the camera.

16:58.851 --> 16:59.685
Smile.

17:21.749 --> 17:22.875
What?

17:26.336 --> 17:28.881
Gi-hun!

17:30.632 --> 17:31.467
Jung-bae.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.094
Fuck, you were alive this whole time?

17:34.678 --> 17:35.804
What are you doing here?

17:35.888 --> 17:38.640
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?

17:38.724 --> 17:41.727
No one's heard from you for three years.
I heard your mom passed away.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.687
I had to hear about it from my wife!

17:43.771 --> 17:45.606
What kind of friend are you?

17:45.689 --> 17:49.068
Were you going to cut me out
because I didn't lend you money?

17:49.151 --> 17:50.778
Keep moving! Don't block the way.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.114
It's not like that.

17:55.491 --> 17:56.909
It's a long story.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.788
Right. I can imagine,
seeing as you're here.

18:00.871 --> 18:04.249
Still, you should've told me
about your mom.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.543
You know how much she liked me.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.753
Why are you here?

18:08.796 --> 18:10.005
What about your wife?

18:11.173 --> 18:12.007
We got divorced.

18:12.758 --> 18:13.675
Divorced?

18:15.010 --> 18:16.178
What about your kid?

18:16.261 --> 18:17.638
With my wife.

18:17.721 --> 18:21.058
Why? I thought you guys were doing okay.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.145
Did you have an affair?

18:25.229 --> 18:27.147
Yeah, like I could manage one.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.565
Let's not talk about it here.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.776
When we get out,
let's go for a drink and talk.

18:33.112 --> 18:37.908
Jung-bae. Whatever happens from now on,
stay close to me.

18:37.991 --> 18:40.410
"Stay close"? You've gotten melodramatic.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.995
Just do as I say!

18:43.122 --> 18:44.998
You must stay close behind me!

18:47.376 --> 18:49.628
All right, man. I will.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.381
Like this? Like Follow the Leader?

18:53.382 --> 18:55.717
By the way, this is crazy.
What is this place?

19:21.702 --> 19:22.744
This way!

19:29.626 --> 19:31.670
Start from the coast. Keep it low.

19:31.753 --> 19:32.754
Got it.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.025
Damn.

19:53.108 --> 19:56.528
-Welcome to the first game.
-My legs! That was a lot of stairs.

19:57.237 --> 20:02.242
All players,
please wait a moment on the field.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.119
Let me repeat.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.579
All players,

20:05.662 --> 20:09.208
-please wait a moment on the field.
-Hey, seÃ±orita.

20:10.459 --> 20:11.877
Don't you know who I am?

20:11.960 --> 20:12.961
Do I have to?

20:13.754 --> 20:14.755
No, you don't.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.883
We can get to know each other.
Tell me about yourself.

20:18.842 --> 20:19.927
Are you hitting on me?

20:21.803 --> 20:24.306
In the sea of faces, you caught my eye

20:24.389 --> 20:27.476
My beauty, my flower blooming among weeds

20:28.810 --> 20:31.521
Red, orange, yellow, green
I'm a legend, Thanos

20:32.731 --> 20:34.858
Look at us in this blue-green

20:34.942 --> 20:37.110
Now give me the green light

20:38.654 --> 20:40.948
I like you!

20:48.121 --> 20:49.331
What's that?

20:51.083 --> 20:52.709
What's that thing?

21:09.226 --> 21:12.229
Damn, this isn't built for us to walk on.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.609
I found him! Over there!

21:43.302 --> 21:47.347
The first game is Red Light, Green Light.

21:47.431 --> 21:50.517
-We're playing Red Light, Green Light?
-See?

21:50.600 --> 21:52.936
We're playing games, not gambling.

21:53.020 --> 21:54.438
This is a children's game.

21:56.815 --> 21:59.776
Red Light, Green Light? The kids' game?

21:59.860 --> 22:01.111
Hey, you.

22:01.695 --> 22:02.529
Me?

22:04.072 --> 22:06.199
Whatâ€¦ What are you doing?

22:07.242 --> 22:09.661
-Damn it.
-Hey, what are you doing?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.705
-Freeze. Don't move.
-Who the hell are you?

22:11.788 --> 22:13.457
Do not move.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.208
What are you doing?

22:19.671 --> 22:20.964
Is that your dental implant?

22:21.715 --> 22:22.549
Where is it?

22:32.059 --> 22:33.060
Damn it.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.238
I'm fucked.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.574
-Where did you get this?
-Get what?

22:47.657 --> 22:49.159
Why was this in here?

22:49.242 --> 22:52.245
That? Before I got on the boat here,

22:52.329 --> 22:56.333
some guy said he had leftover bait
and gave that to me. Why?

22:58.335 --> 23:00.420
Detective Hwang, we're screwed.
They're onto us.

23:00.504 --> 23:03.215
They put the GPS tracker on someone else.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.470
We are ready to start the game.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.561
Start.

23:17.938 --> 23:22.651
Cross the finish line in five minutes
without getting caught.

23:22.734 --> 23:25.362
-If you do, you pass.
-Everyone!

23:25.445 --> 23:29.741
Everyone, listen up! Pay attention!

23:32.285 --> 23:34.663
Listen carefully!

23:34.746 --> 23:37.499
This is not just a game!

23:37.582 --> 23:39.751
If you lose the game,

23:40.419 --> 23:41.628
you die!

23:45.924 --> 23:47.467
What is he saying?

23:49.010 --> 23:51.763
Hey! What are you talking about?

23:51.847 --> 23:55.434
We're going to die
playing Red Light, Green Light?

23:55.517 --> 23:57.519
-Red lightâ€¦
-Yes, that's right!

23:57.602 --> 24:01.731
If they catch you moving,
they will kill you!

24:01.815 --> 24:03.442
They will shoot you from somewhere!

24:03.525 --> 24:05.068
That guy must be drunk.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.487
-Stay on your toes!
-He says they'll shoot us if we lose.

24:07.571 --> 24:09.114
He sounds like my old man

24:09.197 --> 24:13.034
when he gets home drunk
and starts talking crazy.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.912
-Says there's a freaking bug in his head.
-If you get caught, you die!

24:15.996 --> 24:20.584
That doll's eyes are motion detectors!

24:20.667 --> 24:22.878
-See? Talking about devices.
-Stay on your toes!

24:22.961 --> 24:25.172
We might get to join Dad today.

24:25.964 --> 24:28.008
What the hell are you talking about?

24:28.091 --> 24:32.637
I think he's trying to scare us
so he can win the prize money.

24:32.721 --> 24:33.930
That's right!

24:34.014 --> 24:35.515
Don't pull any tricks, asshole!

24:35.599 --> 24:37.976
You have to believe me!

25:06.963 --> 25:11.092
Do not be alarmed or panic!

25:11.176 --> 25:15.722
No matter what happens,
do not panic and start running!

25:15.805 --> 25:17.849
Let the game begin.

25:22.354 --> 25:27.192
Green light, red light.

25:29.528 --> 25:30.654
Freeze!

25:40.830 --> 25:44.292
Well done!
You just need to stay calm like this!

25:44.834 --> 25:47.963
We just have to move
and stop at the right time.

25:48.046 --> 25:49.839
-What's with him?
-Then we can all win.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.967
-We can survive together!
-Do you know him?

25:52.592 --> 25:53.969
No, I don't.

25:56.096 --> 26:00.517
Green light, red light.

26:00.600 --> 26:01.893
Freeze!

26:03.687 --> 26:05.855
Don't move and stay still!

26:05.939 --> 26:07.357
Just relax!

26:08.024 --> 26:10.026
Cut it out. It's you that's scaring me!

26:10.110 --> 26:12.696
Speak with your mouth covered.
It's dangerous.

26:14.614 --> 26:17.701
Green light, red light.

26:17.784 --> 26:20.203
-Why aren't you moving?
-Freeze!

26:26.585 --> 26:32.507
Green light, red light.

26:32.591 --> 26:33.925
Freeze!

26:34.009 --> 26:36.052
-Are you crazy?
-I said cover your mouth!

26:38.888 --> 26:43.393
-Green light, red light.
-Follow me!

26:43.476 --> 26:44.769
Freeze!

26:52.193 --> 26:56.448
Green light, red light.

26:56.531 --> 26:57.699
Freeze!

27:02.287 --> 27:06.708
Green light, red light.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.835
Freeze!

27:08.918 --> 27:11.046
Nobody move!

27:11.129 --> 27:12.964
Is he high or what?

27:13.048 --> 27:15.258
Nope.
No one is like that when they're high.

27:15.842 --> 27:16.676
You've been high?

27:17.719 --> 27:18.595
You interested?

27:23.725 --> 27:24.809
What's that?

27:26.770 --> 27:30.065
He knows you're a flower.
There's a bee on you.

27:30.148 --> 27:31.358
A bee?

27:34.819 --> 27:35.987
Crap.

27:36.071 --> 27:37.405
I just moved.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.456
Nobody move!

27:47.165 --> 27:49.584
You must not move!

27:49.668 --> 27:51.878
Player 196, eliminated.

27:54.422 --> 27:58.176
Jung-bae.
No matter what happens, don't move.

28:02.430 --> 28:04.307
Do not move!

28:15.068 --> 28:17.570
No! Don't move!

28:18.738 --> 28:20.281
Stay still!

28:24.160 --> 28:27.330
If you run, you'll die!

28:28.623 --> 28:32.836
You will all die if you move!

28:38.717 --> 28:42.887
Don't move! Keep yourselves still!

28:42.971 --> 28:44.764
Don't move, please!

28:56.067 --> 28:59.237
Don't move, please!

29:02.240 --> 29:04.909
Freeze!

29:17.630 --> 29:19.549
Let me repeat.

29:20.925 --> 29:25.805
You can move forward while the tagger
shouts, "Green light, red light."

29:26.514 --> 29:28.683
If your movement is detected afterward,

29:28.767 --> 29:31.227
you will be eliminated.

29:54.876 --> 29:59.964
Green light, red light.

30:19.818 --> 30:24.948
Green light, red light.

30:35.375 --> 30:41.089
Green light, red light.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.554
You'll also die
if you don't make it there in time!

30:47.637 --> 30:51.808
That doll is a motion detector!

30:51.891 --> 30:54.352
But it can't detect motion
that's not visible to it!

30:56.604 --> 30:59.482
Get behind someone bigger than you!

30:59.566 --> 31:01.985
Like you're doing Follow the Leader!

31:03.111 --> 31:06.322
We're running out of time!
We've got to move!

31:07.949 --> 31:13.121
-Get behind me.
-Green light, red light.

31:17.083 --> 31:18.251
Gi-hun.

31:20.169 --> 31:21.963
I'll stay close to you now.

31:23.047 --> 31:24.465
Player 188.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.349
Player 244.

31:54.913 --> 31:59.918
Green light, red light.

32:10.345 --> 32:14.974
Green light, red light.

32:36.162 --> 32:37.538
Do not move.

32:37.622 --> 32:38.581
Are you okay?

32:39.415 --> 32:41.042
Get close to me.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.961
Do not move!

32:43.044 --> 32:44.337
Freeze!

32:45.797 --> 32:46.756
What the hell?

32:53.388 --> 32:54.305
Bye.

34:11.007 --> 34:15.470
Let's go!

34:15.970 --> 34:22.018
Green light, red lightâ€¦

35:08.773 --> 35:10.191
It wasn't me.

35:10.983 --> 35:13.361
-She pushed me. I didn't move!
-Player 444.

35:13.444 --> 35:14.779
It was her.

35:15.905 --> 35:19.283
I didn't move.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.996
Player 444, eliminated.

35:24.747 --> 35:27.125
You can do this!

35:27.208 --> 35:29.836
You're almost there!

35:29.919 --> 35:33.381
Green light, red light.

35:34.632 --> 35:36.342
Please help me.

35:45.268 --> 35:48.855
-Green light, red light.
-Hey! Where are you going?

35:52.483 --> 35:54.443
Please help me.

35:54.527 --> 35:57.989
I'll help you. Get up on this turn.

35:59.574 --> 36:03.911
Green light, red light.

36:19.010 --> 36:23.723
Greenâ€¦

36:23.806 --> 36:29.187
lightâ€¦

36:29.270 --> 36:35.735
red light.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.117
Are you okay?

36:44.243 --> 36:45.328
Thank you.

36:46.662 --> 36:47.622
Thank you.

37:06.766 --> 37:07.850
Number 011.

37:09.560 --> 37:10.603
Was that you?

37:12.438 --> 37:14.357
I simply took out a loser.

37:17.735 --> 37:20.279
Player 444, eliminated.

37:58.734 --> 38:02.738
Soldiers who have completed your mission,
please line up outside the sniper rooms.

38:33.019 --> 38:35.646
We can't just sit here and do nothing.

38:35.730 --> 38:38.357
We should at least search
some nearby islands.

38:38.441 --> 38:41.819
They led us here, so I don't think
they're anywhere in this area.

38:41.902 --> 38:44.238
A storm warning
has been issued for tonight.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.365
We'd better head back to port.

38:46.449 --> 38:47.575
Damn it.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.702
The search may take a while.

38:49.785 --> 38:52.204
We should go back
and come up with a new plan.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.999
Who leaked the information?

38:56.167 --> 38:58.836
Did one of you get drunk
and blab about it somewhere?

39:04.550 --> 39:08.387
All right, it's getting cold and dark.
Let's get moving.

39:33.204 --> 39:34.580
You're not feeling well?

39:36.457 --> 39:38.793
-Don't worry.
-What?

39:38.876 --> 39:40.211
I'm okay.

39:40.836 --> 39:44.673
Gi-hun. What the hell is that creepy doll?

39:44.757 --> 39:46.217
It shoots people with its eyes.

39:47.927 --> 39:49.845
It's not the doll.

39:51.305 --> 39:53.307
There are shooters.

39:55.768 --> 39:57.353
How do you know so much?

39:58.145 --> 39:59.814
Have you really been here before?

40:18.666 --> 40:24.547
Congratulations for making it
through the first game.

40:24.630 --> 40:28.926
Here are the results of the first game.

40:32.555 --> 40:36.517
Out of 456 players,
91 players have been eliminated.

40:36.600 --> 40:41.063
365 players have completed the first game.

40:43.065 --> 40:48.571
Congratulations again
for making it through the first game.

40:48.654 --> 40:51.240
Sir! Please don't kill us!

40:51.824 --> 40:54.118
Please don't kill us. I beg you!

40:54.201 --> 40:57.163
As for my son's debt,

40:57.246 --> 41:02.042
I will do whatever it takes
to pay you back!

41:02.126 --> 41:04.753
Please forgive us!

41:04.837 --> 41:07.423
Don't just stand there.
Beg for his forgiveness.

41:08.799 --> 41:11.802
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

41:11.886 --> 41:15.764
-I promise I'll pay it back!
-There seems to be a misunderstanding.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.808
Please don't kill us!

41:17.892 --> 41:22.313
-Please don't kill us!
-Please spare us!

41:24.982 --> 41:28.027
We are not trying to harm you.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.613
We are presenting you with an opportunity.

41:30.696 --> 41:32.448
Clause three of the consent form.

41:35.868 --> 41:39.622
"The games may be terminated
upon a majority vote."

41:40.372 --> 41:41.332
Correct?

41:42.750 --> 41:43.959
That is correct.

41:44.043 --> 41:46.670
Then let us take a vote right now.

41:48.797 --> 41:50.007
Of course.

41:51.592 --> 41:55.596
We respect your right
to freedom of choice.

41:59.350 --> 42:04.897
But first, let me announce
the prize amount that's been accumulated.

42:46.981 --> 42:50.901
The number of players
eliminated in the first game is 91.

42:50.985 --> 42:54.780
Therefore, a total of 9.1 billion won
has been accumulated.

42:55.322 --> 42:58.909
If you quit the games now, the 365 of you

42:58.993 --> 43:02.997
can equally divide the 9.1 billion won

43:03.080 --> 43:05.207
and leave with your share.

43:06.041 --> 43:07.918
How much is that?

43:08.002 --> 43:12.631
Each person's share would be
24,931,500 won.

43:12.715 --> 43:15.384
Fuck. We almost died,
and they're giving us 24 million?

43:15.467 --> 43:17.344
That's fucking bullshit.

43:18.637 --> 43:19.638
Twenty million?

43:21.974 --> 43:23.642
You said 45.6 billion!

43:23.726 --> 43:25.853
The rule is that

43:25.936 --> 43:29.607
a hundred million won will be accumulated
for each eliminated player.

43:30.316 --> 43:33.902
If you choose to play the next game
and more players get eliminated,

43:33.986 --> 43:37.031
the prize amount
will increase accordingly.

43:37.114 --> 43:41.076
How much will it be
if you survive until the end?

43:41.160 --> 43:43.037
As I already told you,

43:43.120 --> 43:46.957
the total amount of prize money
for all 456 players

43:47.041 --> 43:48.959
is 45.6 billion won.

43:49.585 --> 43:52.546
Those who make it through all six games

43:52.630 --> 43:56.342
will equally divide the 45.6 billion won.

43:56.425 --> 44:01.430
So if you're the only one to survive,
you get 45.6 billion?

44:02.556 --> 44:03.766
That is correct.

44:04.391 --> 44:06.560
45.6 billion? Wow!

44:07.269 --> 44:12.107
So we can take a vote again
and decide to leave after the next game?

44:12.191 --> 44:14.401
As promised in the consent form,

44:14.485 --> 44:17.696
you can take a vote after each game

44:17.780 --> 44:21.867
and decide to leave with the prize money
accumulated up to that point.

44:23.285 --> 44:29.958
We always prioritize
your voluntary participation.

44:33.295 --> 44:36.590
Now, let's begin the vote.

44:38.425 --> 44:41.345
If you wish to continue the games,
press the O button.

44:42.012 --> 44:45.516
If you wish to end them,
press the X button.

44:48.811 --> 44:51.980
The vote will be held
in reverse order of your player numbers.

44:54.024 --> 44:55.651
Player 456.

45:12.501 --> 45:14.586
It's all pointless!

45:15.963 --> 45:18.549
You didn't decide
when to come into this world,

45:19.967 --> 45:22.094
and you can't decide
when you leave it either.

45:23.220 --> 45:25.639
When and where you die

45:25.723 --> 45:28.934
were already decided by the gods
the moment you were born.

45:31.395 --> 45:35.399
No matter how hard you try,
you can never escape it.

45:40.988 --> 45:42.740
Once you finish voting,

45:42.823 --> 45:45.617
put the patch you are given
on the right side of your chest

45:45.701 --> 45:48.954
and stand on the side you have chosen.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.542
Player 454.

46:06.847 --> 46:08.432
Player 453.

46:47.262 --> 46:48.931
Player 390.

46:54.144 --> 46:55.479
Player 388.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.279
Player 380.

47:07.157 --> 47:08.700
Player 333.

47:21.421 --> 47:23.257
Player 332.

47:34.184 --> 47:35.519
Player 246.

47:42.776 --> 47:44.027
Player 230.

47:53.287 --> 47:55.581
Wait a minute, everyone! Wait!

47:57.499 --> 47:58.876
You can't do this.

47:59.459 --> 48:01.003
Come to your senses!

48:01.086 --> 48:02.546
Don't you see?

48:02.629 --> 48:05.048
These aren't just any games.

48:05.132 --> 48:07.634
We will all die if we keep playing!

48:09.219 --> 48:11.263
We have to get out of here now.

48:11.346 --> 48:13.390
With a majority vote, we can!

48:13.473 --> 48:15.475
We must stop here!

48:15.559 --> 48:17.477
Who do you think you are?

48:17.561 --> 48:20.647
Why do you keep
egging people on like that?

48:20.731 --> 48:23.650
You scared us by saying they'd shoot us
before the game even began!

48:23.734 --> 48:25.068
That's right!

48:25.819 --> 48:28.572
He was going on about how we'd die,

48:28.655 --> 48:31.074
and I almost did because I got so nervous!

48:31.158 --> 48:33.535
How did you know
they were going to shoot us?

48:33.619 --> 48:34.745
Are you one of them?

48:35.579 --> 48:40.125
Are you conning us all
by pretending to be a player?

48:40.918 --> 48:42.294
Who is this guy?

48:42.377 --> 48:45.130
Did you plant him to mess with our heads?

48:45.213 --> 48:47.758
That's uncalled for.

48:47.841 --> 48:52.512
We wouldn't have won the game
and survived if it weren't for him!

48:52.596 --> 48:57.059
And you! I saw how scared you were.
Your legs were shaking.

48:57.142 --> 48:59.519
You should thank him,
not treat him like a fraud!

48:59.603 --> 49:02.230
And who the hell are you?
Are you conspiring with him?

49:02.314 --> 49:03.815
Rude. How old are you?

49:03.899 --> 49:05.901
Older than you. What are you going to do?

49:05.984 --> 49:06.985
-Come on now.
-What?

49:07.069 --> 49:09.988
Please don't do this. Listen.

49:10.072 --> 49:13.742
None of us would be alive

49:13.825 --> 49:18.246
if it weren't for this gentleman.

49:18.330 --> 49:21.041
So enough with the greed.

49:21.124 --> 49:23.460
Let's put our lives first

49:23.543 --> 49:25.504
and get out of this place! Okay?

49:25.587 --> 49:28.507
-That's right!
-Let's all get out of here!

49:28.590 --> 49:31.343
-Let's get out of here!
-No, we have to keep playing!

49:36.431 --> 49:40.018
I have played these games before!

49:42.437 --> 49:44.856
I have done this before!

49:47.067 --> 49:51.697
I knew about the first game
because I had played it before!

49:52.698 --> 49:55.742
I played the games here three years ago!

49:56.576 --> 49:58.912
And everyone who was with meâ€¦

50:01.206 --> 50:03.125
died here!

50:04.543 --> 50:06.670
-They all died?
-All of them?

50:06.753 --> 50:08.422
-Really? No way.
-Hold on.

50:08.505 --> 50:11.049
If they all died,
how did you survive alone?

50:12.259 --> 50:16.388
Wait, are you saying
you were the sole winner?

50:19.933 --> 50:20.976
That's right.

50:23.937 --> 50:25.897
I was the final winner.

50:30.527 --> 50:32.195
If we continue the games,

50:33.405 --> 50:36.033
every single person here,

50:37.743 --> 50:39.911
just like all the people back then,

50:41.580 --> 50:42.706
will die in the end.

50:46.168 --> 50:47.502
Bullshit.

50:48.086 --> 50:52.507
If you were the sole winner,
it means you won 45.6 billion won.

50:53.216 --> 50:55.677
If you really did,
why would you come back here?

50:55.761 --> 50:57.554
That's right! He's lying!

50:57.637 --> 50:58.764
Cut the crap!

50:58.847 --> 50:59.931
He's a total nutcase!

51:00.015 --> 51:01.892
If someone like you can win, so can I!

51:01.975 --> 51:04.853
If you really won,
it actually works better for us.

51:06.146 --> 51:08.065
You can give us some tips

51:09.900 --> 51:11.526
on how to beat these games.

51:12.319 --> 51:13.445
That's right!

51:14.321 --> 51:18.283
We have a previous winner with us,
so what do we have to worry about?

51:18.366 --> 51:20.911
Come on, let's do this!

51:20.994 --> 51:22.162
-Come on!
-Yeah!

51:22.245 --> 51:24.498
-Let's make some money!
-Let's do this!

51:26.750 --> 51:29.503
-Let's do it!
-Let's try!

51:30.962 --> 51:32.214
Let's make money!

51:33.048 --> 51:36.259
Please, I'm begging you.
We have to get out now!

51:36.343 --> 51:40.055
If we keep playing, more people will die.

51:41.515 --> 51:43.266
That could be you.

51:44.101 --> 51:47.270
We have to stop this now
and get out of here.

51:48.563 --> 51:49.606
Everyone.

51:51.483 --> 51:56.988
From here on, we will not tolerate actions
that disrupt the voting process.

51:59.116 --> 52:02.285
Now, let's resume the vote.

52:02.369 --> 52:03.745
Player 228.

52:35.735 --> 52:36.778
Player 100.

53:00.385 --> 53:01.428
Player 007.

53:11.897 --> 53:13.273
Yong-sik!

53:14.774 --> 53:16.568
Don't get any stupid ideas.

53:24.075 --> 53:26.286
That's right!

53:28.872 --> 53:29.873
Player 006.

53:57.567 --> 53:58.902
Player 004.

54:20.632 --> 54:22.634
Lastly, Player 001.

54:24.886 --> 54:26.680
Everyone, say O!

54:26.763 --> 54:30.600
-O!
-X!

58:17.410 --> 58:22.415
