14:10.541 --> 14:12.750
[pop music continues]

14:19.916 --> 14:22.333
-It's quite okay here.
-Mmm.

14:25.541 --> 14:26.541
-It'll be fine.
-It'll be fine.

14:32.958 --> 14:35.540
[in English]
Okay, whatever that was. Daisy!

14:36.375 --> 14:37.750
-Yeah?
-Take her.

14:37.833 --> 14:38.958
Take me where?

14:39.875 --> 14:40.915
To the dungeon.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
[chuckles]

14:43.125 --> 14:45.040
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just going to show you around.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.125
Okay, cool.

14:46.208 --> 14:47.208
[in German] Good luck.

14:47.290 --> 14:49.290
[in English]
My name is Persephone Porter-Peregrin.

14:49.375 --> 14:51.625
-I'm the school president.
-Cool, congrats.

14:51.708 --> 14:55.415
Well, you know what?
You can just call me Persy, honestly.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.540
Sorry, mate. And vote for me again!

14:58.625 --> 15:00.500
Where do we want to start?

15:00.583 --> 15:03.875
Erm, school canteen? Or hallways? Or...

15:03.958 --> 15:09.625
[gasps] Library!
Library slash make-out central. Let's go.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.000
I've done seven school tours
in five years.

15:12.083 --> 15:13.708
Can I just have my locker number?

15:14.583 --> 15:18.208
Oh. Sure. It's right here.

15:18.750 --> 15:21.041
-And this is your key.
-[sighs]

15:22.375 --> 15:23.833
It's cursed.

15:25.291 --> 15:26.666
Excuse me?

15:26.750 --> 15:29.000
The locker. It's cursed, they say.

15:30.583 --> 15:32.333
Belonged to Anabel Scott.

15:32.415 --> 15:34.540
-Anabel Scott?
-[Persephone] Yeah.

15:34.625 --> 15:35.625
Weird.

15:35.708 --> 15:36.708
Why?

15:37.708 --> 15:39.708
I feel like I've heard that name before.

15:39.790 --> 15:41.500
-[lock clicks]
-Well, could be.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.000
That's her.

15:45.790 --> 15:47.083
Is she dead?

15:47.165 --> 15:49.333
No, she just vanished.

15:49.415 --> 15:52.500
Nobody knows where she is.
Not even her best friends,

15:52.583 --> 15:54.540
Arthur, Jasper, Henry.

15:54.625 --> 15:56.000
Who you're gonna love...

15:56.458 --> 15:59.583
-She's right there. It's her.
-...if you're into boys. Are you?

15:59.665 --> 16:00.958
Uh-huh.

16:01.041 --> 16:02.041
[Liv] This can't be.

16:04.625 --> 16:06.083
[Persephone] Hey, where are you going?

16:06.166 --> 16:09.291
[indistinct chatter]

16:09.375 --> 16:10.375
Jasper, check in there.

16:12.625 --> 16:13.833
[girl] It was so nice.

16:19.583 --> 16:20.958
-She's gone.
-Jesus!

16:21.041 --> 16:23.083
-Bro, are you sure it was her?
-[Henry] She can't be too far.

16:23.166 --> 16:24.958
-It was pretty dark in the cemetery.
-Let's just go to Gray's later.

16:25.041 --> 16:27.791
-That's a show.
-[Henry] We'll find her again.

16:27.875 --> 16:29.708
[Jasper] Yeah, I know,
this is so fucked up.

16:30.666 --> 16:33.415
-[train horn blares]
-[wheels squeaking]

16:33.500 --> 16:36.040
[in German]
Have you ever had a dream about someone,

16:36.125 --> 16:37.500
then seen them in real life?

16:38.790 --> 16:40.165
You have a crush.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.708
-Oh, my God. I knew it.
-No, I don't.

16:42.790 --> 16:45.250
Okay, chill. I'm just saying.

16:45.875 --> 16:48.125
But hypothetically speaking,
if you had a dream about someone,

16:48.208 --> 16:49.665
and then meet them in real life,

16:49.750 --> 16:51.708
they're literally
the person of your dreams.

16:51.790 --> 16:53.915
[in English] Highgate Cemetery.

16:55.583 --> 16:56.583
[in German] See you later!

16:57.875 --> 17:00.208
Liv, what are you doing?
That's the wrong bus!

17:04.500 --> 17:08.083

Isn't this the one from the dream?

17:39.208 --> 17:40.666
[in English] Scott Family.

17:40.750 --> 17:41.750
[in German] What?

17:42.750 --> 17:45.333
Isn't this all from the dream?

17:47.666 --> 17:49.291
This can't be.

17:51.708 --> 17:53.666
WHY SOME DREAMS SEEM REAL

18:09.583 --> 18:12.666
[in English] Lucid dreaming, it's
the ability to know that you are dreaming

18:12.750 --> 18:16.000
while you're dreaming
and gain control over your dreams.

18:16.083 --> 18:18.500
Step one: Perform a reality test.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.000
Look at your hand. Does it look different?

18:21.083 --> 18:23.708
Can you count your fingers?
And has anything changed?

18:23.791 --> 18:26.000
If it has, you might be dreaming.

18:26.083 --> 18:28.041
But this is an obvious example.

18:28.125 --> 18:31.333
If you dive deeper,
there's a lot more to it.

18:33.250 --> 18:36.958
One, two, three, four, five.

18:38.666 --> 18:41.166
One, two, three, four, five.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.250
-[chuckles]
-[doorbell rings]

18:43.333 --> 18:45.583
[Henry] Should we ambush her
like that, all of us?

18:45.666 --> 18:47.916
-[Jasper] I don't know, it feels weird.
-[Arthur] She is the chosen one.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.416
-[Jasper] She's your chosen one.
-[doorbell rings]

18:49.500 --> 18:51.666
-[Henry] What?
-[Jasper] He wants to talk to her alone.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.041
-[Henry] We're all looking at her.
-[Jasper] Bro, we were all trying

18:53.125 --> 18:54.125
to move her to the graveyard.

18:54.208 --> 18:55.291
[Arthur] It wasn't exactly subtle.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.125
-[Jasper scoffs] A lie?
-[Henry] Shut up.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.416
[Liv] Shit.

18:59.333 --> 19:00.500
[Grayson]
What the fuck are you doing here?

19:00.583 --> 19:01.583
[Jasper] You have to invite her.

19:01.666 --> 19:03.166
-[Grayson] No.
-Grayson, we're running out of time.

19:03.250 --> 19:05.041
I don't want Liv
to be involved in this, okay?

19:05.125 --> 19:07.041
-I don't even--
-[door creaks open]

19:07.125 --> 19:08.625
Hi. Er...

19:09.916 --> 19:12.958
My mate Arthur is having
a Halloween party this weekend.

19:13.041 --> 19:15.708
Yup. Everyone's gonna be there.

19:15.791 --> 19:17.000
Oh, wow.

19:17.541 --> 19:18.541
Except me.

19:19.208 --> 19:21.750
And why not?
Can't be as scary as the graveyard was.

19:21.833 --> 19:23.000
What graveyard?

19:24.541 --> 19:25.916
The one where you buried Anabel?

19:27.208 --> 19:28.208
Oh, please.

19:28.833 --> 19:29.833
We didn't bury her.

19:29.916 --> 19:32.208
We chopped her up into tiny pieces
and fed her to the seagulls.

19:32.291 --> 19:33.500
[Jasper chuckling]

19:33.583 --> 19:36.208
Oh, my God. Arthur, this is...

19:36.291 --> 19:38.041
-[Henry] It's true.
-He's kidding.

19:38.125 --> 19:40.541
Well, I don't have a costume, so...

19:40.625 --> 19:42.416
I think Grayson's jumper suits you.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.916
Oh, yeah, I kinda wanted my jumper back.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.000
-It's very cosy.
-Yeah, which is why I want it back.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.041
[Jasper] All right. In a bit then.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.208
[Arthur] Well,
that wasn't so hard, was it?

19:54.291 --> 19:55.958
Well, she didn't say she was coming.

19:56.791 --> 19:59.416
[Arthur] Come on, Henry,
she's not gonna invite us into her yard.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.541
[Jasper] Weirdo.

20:00.625 --> 20:02.666
-[Jasper laughing]
-[Henry] You're idiots.

20:02.750 --> 20:04.000

[thudding]

20:19.875 --> 20:22.583
[dramatic music playing]

20:31.791 --> 20:35.333
[Liv] If you can't count your fingers,
it's a dream.

21:28.000 --> 21:32.000
[music playing in the distance]

21:55.416 --> 21:56.791
[Mia, in English] More cream
or more marmalade this time?

21:56.875 --> 21:58.708
[Dad] Er, jam time. Let's do it.

22:04.333 --> 22:05.375
[Liv] Butter.

22:08.541 --> 22:09.541
Dad.

22:11.583 --> 22:14.000
[in German]
Mia, you are really dreaming of him.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.750
[girl, in English] You won't get in there.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.250
You're Anabel.

22:21.750 --> 22:23.000
Guilty as charged.

22:24.708 --> 22:26.083
I didn't want to go in there.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.000
Of course, you didn't.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.958
Er, it's private.

22:31.541 --> 22:33.208
What you want is behind that door.

22:34.416 --> 22:36.375
All you have to do
is go to Arthur's party,

22:37.000 --> 22:38.416
and you'll see your dad again.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.166
[licking]

[whines]

22:50.250 --> 22:51.250
Butter.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.125
[in German] I need a costume.

22:58.208 --> 23:01.416
[dance music playing]

23:02.166 --> 23:05.250
[in English] You're not a fan of wearing
your own clothes, are you?

23:05.333 --> 23:07.083
I look great, don't you think?

23:07.791 --> 23:08.791
Yeah.

23:08.875 --> 23:13.333
This was my graduation outfit
from when I was in primary school.

23:13.416 --> 23:14.708
[chuckles]

23:14.791 --> 23:16.000
And you're giving it back this time.

23:16.083 --> 23:18.083
Wow, is this Arthur's house?

23:18.166 --> 23:20.625
Yeah, Arthur has money.

-[all cheering]
-Hey, what did you do to your hair?

23:29.083 --> 23:31.291
I shaved it. I shaved it.

23:31.375 --> 23:32.791
Okay, I'm gonna go get drinks.

23:32.875 --> 23:36.250
-Don't talk to the boys.
-Okay. Yes, sir. Brother.

23:36.333 --> 23:39.166
[cheering continues]

23:39.250 --> 23:40.625
Ahoy, sailor.

23:41.583 --> 23:42.791
Ahoy. [giggles]

23:42.875 --> 23:44.250
Henry.

23:44.333 --> 23:45.875
-You look great.
-Thanks.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.750
Er, you look... like a psychopath.

23:50.291 --> 23:51.666
Thank you. Erm...

23:51.750 --> 23:53.000
Honestly, I didn't even know
it was Halloween.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.083
It was just really good timing.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.083
Oh, yeah. Where's the chainsaw?

23:56.750 --> 23:59.000
I, er... Well, I left it in...

23:59.083 --> 24:00.416
my last victim.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.000
[chuckles]

24:02.916 --> 24:04.375
So, er, where was this?

24:05.000 --> 24:09.000
Er, that's, er...
Anabel's grandma's house in Spain.

24:09.083 --> 24:11.250
Er, we went there last Spring.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.958
Is that where she is now?

24:14.583 --> 24:17.125
I... honestly, I don't know.

24:17.208 --> 24:18.250
Hm.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.000
-Liv.
-[Liv] Arthur.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.541
Glad you could make it.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.208
So, are you ready?

24:24.291 --> 24:27.125
Er, sure. Ready for... Ready for what?

24:27.208 --> 24:28.666
[chuckles]

24:28.750 --> 24:30.708
[Arthur] Come on.
We won't murder you.

24:30.791 --> 24:34.000
[dance music playing]

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
[sniffs]

24:37.583 --> 24:39.208
Hey! Hey! What the fuck is this?

24:39.875 --> 24:41.500
It's medicinal. For my migraines.

24:41.875 --> 24:42.875
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

24:42.958 --> 24:44.583
Well, try and drink some water
for a change.

24:44.666 --> 24:46.000
What the fuck?

24:46.750 --> 24:48.583
-Sorry about that. Cousin issues.
-[Persephone] I hate you.

24:48.666 --> 24:50.083
Where'd it all go?

24:50.166 --> 24:51.958
Persephone is your cousin?

24:52.041 --> 24:54.500
[Henry] Oh, she's basically his sister.

24:54.583 --> 24:56.666
[Jasper] Aw, okay. I'll be back.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.000
Wow.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.416
Nice. Are we a band now or something?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.625
[Jasper] You wish.

25:02.708 --> 25:05.000
It's my parent's studio,
so don't touch anything.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.541
-You ever heard of the Book of Dreams?
-No.

25:13.625 --> 25:14.916
-[loud knocking]
-[Grayson] Hey!

25:15.000 --> 25:17.291
-Open the door!
-He's gonna be pissed.

25:17.375 --> 25:19.875
-You guys are arseholes.
-[Arthur] Love you, too.

25:19.958 --> 25:24.000
I said I don't want Liv
to get involved in this.

25:24.083 --> 25:26.708
Oh, maybe I don't want
to be involved in this

25:26.791 --> 25:28.583
little boys club.

25:29.916 --> 25:31.958
-[Henry] Ouch. That's a pity.
-Okay, that's great. Let's go home.

25:32.041 --> 25:33.791
-Come on, Gray.
-What? No, no, Grayson. No.

25:33.875 --> 25:35.333
She's already a part of this, okay?

25:35.416 --> 25:37.958
-She's a natural dreamer.
-Okay. How?

25:39.416 --> 25:41.000
How is this even possible?

25:41.500 --> 25:42.583
I don't know.

25:42.666 --> 25:44.291
[Grayson] There isn't another copy
of the book, is there?

25:44.375 --> 25:46.291
-[Jasper] I don't think so.
-Last midsummer's eve...

25:46.916 --> 25:50.000
Anabel showed us... the Book of Dreams.

25:50.708 --> 25:51.791
[latch clicks]

25:51.875 --> 25:55.458
-It's been in her family for generations.
-All right. Can I see?

25:56.708 --> 25:58.000
To unleash its magic...

25:59.291 --> 26:01.000
four men, and a maiden...

26:01.083 --> 26:02.500
A maiden? Really?

26:02.833 --> 26:04.916
-[Henry] It's not like virgin.
-It's what the book wants.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.916
It's a pretty sexist book.

26:07.208 --> 26:08.208
It is.

26:08.291 --> 26:11.416
Four men and a maiden
must complete the games.

26:12.583 --> 26:14.375
Rituals, if you will.

26:14.958 --> 26:17.416
Now, we've already completed
the first initiation ritual.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.500
Since then we became dreamers.

26:21.166 --> 26:22.250
[Henry] We, er...

26:23.125 --> 26:26.000
are able to go into other people's dreams.

26:27.416 --> 26:29.416
But now Anabel's gone,
we need a new maiden.

26:31.208 --> 26:32.541
Why is she gone?

26:34.916 --> 26:36.750
-She's ghosting us.
-[Henry] Of course.

26:36.833 --> 26:37.833
She dumped him.

26:37.916 --> 26:39.000
-Shut up.
-[Jasper] You shut up.

26:39.083 --> 26:40.083
-I'm just involving our new maiden.
-[Liv] Okay.

26:40.166 --> 26:41.208
[Arthur] You don't have
to tell her everything.

26:41.291 --> 26:46.083
"When Hallow's Eve is due,
make your greatest wish come true."

26:46.416 --> 26:47.875
Are you serious? Is this a joke?

26:47.958 --> 26:51.083
[chuckles] Come on, guys.
Did you write this?

26:51.458 --> 26:52.625
Yeah, that's just stupid.

26:53.625 --> 26:54.875
Is this a joke?

26:56.291 --> 26:57.958
Look, we don't know how you can do it.

26:58.625 --> 27:00.000
Or if you were just playing a game.

27:01.208 --> 27:03.583
But like Jazz said,
you're a natural dreamer.

27:03.666 --> 27:06.000
So at this point,
you might as well make it official.

27:07.625 --> 27:08.625
So...

27:09.375 --> 27:10.375
What do you think?

27:11.125 --> 27:14.041
Liv, you really don't have to.

27:14.125 --> 27:16.375
She's old enough to make her own decision.

27:17.500 --> 27:20.291
So, what do you say then, Silver? You in?

27:21.750 --> 27:23.708
All right. Bring it on.

27:26.583 --> 27:28.791
Whoa! You promised you wouldn't murder me.

27:28.875 --> 27:31.958
Relax. We just need
a teeny-tiny drop of blood.

27:37.875 --> 27:38.875
Okay.

27:39.958 --> 27:42.416
[Grayson] I hate blood. Makes me sick.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.125
[Henry] Don't faint on us again, Gray.

27:44.208 --> 27:46.625
-[Grayson] What? I never fainted.
-[Arthur] Shhh.

27:55.791 --> 27:58.083
Okay, the ritual states,

27:58.708 --> 28:02.833
we need to write our dreams
on a piece of paper and burn it.

28:03.708 --> 28:05.000
What's the catch?

28:05.083 --> 28:07.250
Bro, there is no catch.

28:07.875 --> 28:09.458
There is always a catch.

28:09.916 --> 28:11.541
-Pass me the pen.
-[Arthur] Please.

28:13.833 --> 28:15.000
Jasper's first.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.000
Cheers.

28:27.375 --> 28:28.375
[lighter clicks]

28:28.458 --> 28:30.000
What I really wish for...

28:31.375 --> 28:33.458
is to become
a professional basketball player.

28:33.541 --> 28:35.125
-[Grayson] Nice.
-[Arthur] Surprise, surprise.

28:35.208 --> 28:37.000
[Henry] You already are
our champion, Jazzy.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.291
Grayson...

28:38.375 --> 28:41.000
-[light clicks]
-I wish...

28:43.541 --> 28:46.333
to be school president.

28:46.416 --> 28:48.916
-That's a nice wish.
-[Henry] Gray for president.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.458
[Jasper] Yeah, well, good luck with that.

28:50.541 --> 28:51.666
[lighter clicks]

28:52.666 --> 28:54.750
I wish to be together with Anabel again.

28:54.833 --> 28:55.875
[Jasper] That's sad, bro.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.000
[lighter clicks]

29:01.000 --> 29:02.458
[Grayson] Henry, you're next.

29:02.541 --> 29:03.625
I wish...

29:08.250 --> 29:11.000
-None of your business.
-[Grayson] Bro, are you serious?

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
-Liv?
-[lighter clicks]

29:18.458 --> 29:19.458
Liv?

29:25.416 --> 29:26.500
[Liv] I wish...

29:34.208 --> 29:36.458
[in German]
I wish I could talk to Dad again.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.541
There you are.

30:23.708 --> 30:25.375
See you in your dream.

30:37.333 --> 30:39.375

31:25.333 --> 31:26.791
our new school president,

31:26.875 --> 31:32.000
-Grayson!
-Yes! Yes!

31:32.083 --> 31:35.458

31:35.541 --> 31:37.875
[crowd] Grayson! Grayson! Grayson!

31:37.958 --> 31:39.750
-[mic feedback]
-[Grayson] Thank you!

31:39.833 --> 31:40.833
[cheering]

31:40.916 --> 31:44.041
[Grayson] I just want to say,
this is not about winning.

31:44.125 --> 31:46.208
Of course, this is what he dreams about.

31:46.291 --> 31:48.166
This is about fighting for your dreams!

31:48.250 --> 31:50.916
And you just made it fucking real!

31:51.000 --> 31:54.291
-Thank you!
-[dance music playing]

31:54.375 --> 31:55.875
-[cheering, shouting]
-I love you!

31:58.250 --> 31:59.541

32:03.041 --> 32:05.000
-[laughter continues]
-This is hardcore, man.

32:05.083 --> 32:06.166
[laughter intensifies]

32:06.250 --> 32:07.666
[camera shutters clicking]

32:07.750 --> 32:10.416
-This is so going viral.
-[shutters clicking]

32:10.500 --> 32:13.333
[hysterical laughter]

32:13.416 --> 32:14.666
I'm sorry.

32:15.458 --> 32:18.791
-Liv. Liv, come with me.
-I'm sorry.

32:20.250 --> 32:22.916
Come on, hurry up
before this all turns to shit.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.000
[door thuds]

32:24.625 --> 32:27.000
-That was so weird.
-Well, that was close.

32:28.000 --> 32:29.000
[giggles]

32:30.875 --> 32:35.500
So, what the hell is this place actually?

32:35.583 --> 32:38.291
Yeah, well, we call this, er, dream hall.

32:39.041 --> 32:42.833
Erm, it's where all dreams connect.
Everyone has their own door. Yeah?

32:43.333 --> 32:46.125
But, we can only enter the door

32:46.208 --> 32:49.000
if we wear something belonging
to the person dreaming, right?

32:49.666 --> 32:52.166
Yes. Er, we call them anchors.

32:53.208 --> 32:56.166
Anchors? Why anchors?
Why not, keys?

32:57.000 --> 32:58.583
'Cause they unlock the door, right?

33:00.541 --> 33:01.791
Shut up, smart-arse.

33:01.875 --> 33:03.458
Okay. Whose dream is this then?

33:05.166 --> 33:06.583
Maybe you're dreaming me.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.000
Or you're dreaming of me.

33:13.666 --> 33:15.291
-[distorted murmuring]
-[Grayson] Wake up!

33:15.375 --> 33:17.000
[Grayson] Liv! Wake up!

33:17.083 --> 33:18.083
[Henry] What?

33:19.208 --> 33:20.375
Wake up!

33:20.458 --> 33:22.041
Wake up! Wake up!

33:22.125 --> 33:23.750
-What?
-Liv, you can't do that!

33:23.833 --> 33:26.666
-Do what?
-Dreams are private. Okay?

33:26.750 --> 33:27.750
Okay.

33:27.833 --> 33:30.583
So if you want to be a part of this,
you have to respect some rules.

33:30.666 --> 33:32.583
Well, no one told me about any rules.

33:32.958 --> 33:34.458
Okay. Well,
I'm telling you now, so listen.

33:35.000 --> 33:36.583
-Shh.
-Rule number one...

33:36.666 --> 33:39.666
is no snooping around
in your friends' dreams.

33:39.750 --> 33:41.000
Don't do that again.

33:41.416 --> 33:42.458
Okay.

33:42.541 --> 33:43.750
Take it off.

33:43.833 --> 33:45.833
-What?
-Take my stuff off of you.

33:46.333 --> 33:47.333
Okay.

33:48.458 --> 33:50.000
[Grayson] Don't touch my stuff.

33:50.083 --> 33:51.083
Right.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.833
-[train screeching]
-[indistinct chatter]

You okay?

[Persephone sniffing]

34:06.625 --> 34:07.875
Haven't you heard?

34:08.500 --> 34:09.666
No.

34:15.666 --> 34:17.583
[cheering] Jasper! Jasper! Jasper!

34:17.666 --> 34:19.833

-[groaning continues]
-Ooh!

34:21.541 --> 34:23.333
-[Jasper sobbing] No!
-When was this?

34:23.416 --> 34:24.583
An hour ago.

34:26.500 --> 34:28.958
[Persephone] Broke his arm.
The season's over for him.

34:29.041 --> 34:31.375
Maybe even his career.
What a nightmare.

34:32.208 --> 34:33.250
Vote for me!

34:38.875 --> 34:40.541
[Liv, in German]
Today, I'll make it into your dream.

35:08.416 --> 35:12.000
[in English]
Oh, hi, Henry. Fancy seeing you here.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.000
Oh, this? [chuckles]

35:15.750 --> 35:18.250
Yeah, I, erm... Thanks. I...

35:18.333 --> 35:20.000
always sleep in...

35:21.666 --> 35:23.416
in daywear.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.000
Like a crazy person.

35:27.583 --> 35:30.000
Okay. Shut up and go to sleep.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.000

35:56.208 --> 35:57.958
[Henry, in English] Snooping around again?

35:58.041 --> 35:59.458
Did you dress up just for this?

36:00.083 --> 36:01.416
Erm, no.

36:03.333 --> 36:04.333
Did you?

36:05.000 --> 36:06.916
-What? This?
-Yeah.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.041
No, I didn't.

36:09.250 --> 36:11.250
-[Henry] Let me show you something.
-[Liv] Okay.

36:12.416 --> 36:13.416
[door chimes ring]

36:13.500 --> 36:14.750
[Doll]
I'm so happy to be at a tea party.

36:14.833 --> 36:18.000
[Amy] So you be the little girl
and I'm the Mummy.

36:18.083 --> 36:19.083
[Doll] This is absolutely fantastic.

36:19.166 --> 36:21.166
-Oh, God, this is nice.
-This is your dream?

36:21.750 --> 36:23.791
-Yeah, what gave it away?
-[Liv chuckles]

36:23.875 --> 36:25.625
No, it's my sister Amy's.

36:25.708 --> 36:26.708
[Liv] Aw.

36:26.791 --> 36:27.833
She looks like you.

36:27.916 --> 36:30.416
This tap water tastes delicious.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.833
It's hot chocolate, silly.

36:32.916 --> 36:34.791
-[Doll] Are we allowed hot chocolate?
-[Amy] Yeah,

36:34.875 --> 36:37.041
just don't tell the witch.

36:37.125 --> 36:40.541
-Oh! Shh! I promise.
-[Amy giggles]

36:40.625 --> 36:44.416
So, who's the popsicle stick? Your dad?

36:45.541 --> 36:47.416
No, that's, er... That's me.

36:47.500 --> 36:48.708
[laughs]

36:48.791 --> 36:49.791
No, I, er...

36:49.875 --> 36:52.041
I made him for her.

36:52.125 --> 36:55.875
But, bow-ties are not my style,

36:55.958 --> 36:58.875
but Amy wanted me to look smart, so...

36:59.375 --> 37:01.416
-[giggles]
-What? [chuckles]

37:01.500 --> 37:02.708
[indistinct chatter continues]

37:02.791 --> 37:04.000
You're cute.

37:06.958 --> 37:09.166
[soft music playing]

kids left your damn Lego lying around?

-It's turning into a nightmare.
-What?!

-Where's the door?
-Oh, shit!

37:28.333 --> 37:30.041
[female voice] You're the worst thing
that ever happened to me.

37:30.125 --> 37:31.458
There's another way to get out of a dream.

37:31.541 --> 37:32.875
Okay, what is it?

37:33.708 --> 37:35.291
Turn, like dancing.

37:35.375 --> 37:37.708
[female voice]
You make my life a living hell!

37:39.458 --> 37:40.458
Whoa!

37:40.541 --> 37:43.541
When you turn slowly in a dream...
Ta-da, new location.

37:44.666 --> 37:46.208
Okay, cool. What now?

37:46.291 --> 37:48.000
-Now we're gonna jump.
-What?

-[thunder rumbling]
-[train whistles]

[Liv] No. Are you joking? It's too high.

37:53.125 --> 37:54.791
[Henry] You don't want to know
but you're gonna find out.

37:54.875 --> 37:55.875
No way! No!

37:55.958 --> 37:58.250
Jumping is just another way
out of a dream.

37:58.333 --> 38:00.000
You'll wake up before you hit the ground.

38:00.875 --> 38:02.166
[Liv] I'm not doing it.

38:02.250 --> 38:04.041
Damn it! Do you want to stay here
with my crazy mum?

38:04.125 --> 38:05.291
[Henry's mum] It's all your fault.

Erm...

Cold feet?

This is too much for me. Good night, Liv.

Hey.

38:58.291 --> 38:59.500
So...

39:00.333 --> 39:01.416
about last night...

39:02.500 --> 39:03.708
Nothing happened.

39:06.083 --> 39:08.000
What do you mean, "nothing happened"?

39:09.458 --> 39:11.875
We jumped from a ginormous dollhouse,

nearly got stuck
in your sister's dream, and...

It's fine, Liv.

39:21.333 --> 39:22.416
at my favourite spot.

39:22.500 --> 39:24.541
-Er...
-I know. I'll put you on the list.

39:24.625 --> 39:25.958
But first, wish me luck, okay?

39:26.041 --> 39:27.208
-What for?
-You got this, it'll be fine.

39:27.291 --> 39:28.625
School president election.

39:28.708 --> 39:30.500
-[Grayson] I don't know. I'm just nervous.
-It starts in, like, ten minutes.

39:30.583 --> 39:31.583
Good luck.

39:32.125 --> 39:34.666
-Have any of your wishes come true?
-[Arthur] No.

39:34.750 --> 39:36.166
Relax, mate.

39:36.250 --> 39:37.625
Don't need magic to beat Persy.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.500
[Arthur] Hey, take it easy.

39:42.375 --> 39:43.541
How do I look?

39:44.500 --> 39:47.041
-You look like a substitute teacher, bruv.
-[Henry] You are not wrong.

39:47.125 --> 39:49.333
That is not true. Look at me.

39:49.416 --> 39:52.333
[Jasper] Reminds me of Mr Smithers.
Remember Mr Smithers. [chuckles]

39:53.416 --> 39:55.541
-You look stunning.
-[school bell rings]

39:55.625 --> 39:58.000
I'm sure you're all dying
to get back to class,

39:58.083 --> 39:59.541
so we'll make this quick.

39:59.625 --> 40:01.375
The votes have been counted.

40:02.250 --> 40:03.416
And the winner...

40:04.500 --> 40:05.541
is Grayson.

40:05.625 --> 40:07.708
[upbeat music playing]

40:07.791 --> 40:10.416
[cheers, applause]

40:10.500 --> 40:12.416
Come up. Say a few words, Grayson.

40:12.500 --> 40:14.458
[applause continues]

40:17.708 --> 40:19.791
-[mic feeds back]
-Er, thank you guys.

40:19.875 --> 40:22.416
I just want to say that
this is not about winning.

40:22.958 --> 40:25.416
This is about fighting for your dreams.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.416
And never giving up.

40:27.500 --> 40:28.500
Whoo!

40:28.583 --> 40:30.708
And we've all been dreaming together

40:30.791 --> 40:32.583
for a long time,
and you just made it real.

40:32.666 --> 40:34.041
So, thank you so much.

40:34.125 --> 40:35.125
Thank you.

40:35.208 --> 40:36.541
-[applause continues]
-[mic thuds]

40:36.625 --> 40:38.583
[mic feeds back]

40:38.666 --> 40:40.250
Thank you. I love you.

40:40.333 --> 40:42.000
-[boy 1] Woo-hoo!
-[boy 2] Love you, Grayson!

40:42.083 --> 40:43.416
-[boy 3] We love you, Grayson.
-[applause continues]

40:43.500 --> 40:45.416
-[audience gasps]
-[audience laughing]

40:45.500 --> 40:47.000
-[man] Shrimp dick!
-[clamouring]

40:49.416 --> 40:51.250
-[woman] Where's the rest of it?
-[camera shutters clicking]

40:51.333 --> 40:53.791
Who the fuck did that?
What the fuck was that?

40:53.875 --> 40:57.083
-[camera shutters clicking]
-[Liv] Stop! Stop!

40:57.166 --> 40:59.916
[Grayson] What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?

41:00.000 --> 41:02.375
Fuck me, that was bad, bro!

41:02.458 --> 41:04.625
That's literally my worst nightmare.

41:04.708 --> 41:06.333
-[boy] No way!
-[chatter continues]

41:06.416 --> 41:07.833
Erm...

41:07.916 --> 41:09.750
but your dream came true.

41:09.833 --> 41:12.000
I mean, she's not wrong.
You did win.

41:12.083 --> 41:14.458
[students laughing]

41:16.166 --> 41:17.416
[Grayson] What the fuck was that?

41:18.166 --> 41:19.666
What the fuck was that?

41:20.458 --> 41:22.708
I've fully broken my hand

41:22.791 --> 41:24.708
and my career is done out,

41:24.791 --> 41:26.833
like, this... this is my worst nightmare.

41:26.916 --> 41:29.541
Erm, thank you to everyone. Peace.

41:29.625 --> 41:32.291
[pop music playing]

41:32.375 --> 41:33.500
[knocking]

41:33.583 --> 41:35.083
-[Grayson] No, I'm sleeping.
-Grayson!

41:37.083 --> 41:38.458
Why do you knock then?

41:39.666 --> 41:41.000
Sorry, bad new habit.

41:41.791 --> 41:46.708
Okay, so, Jasper's nightmare coming true
was, like, very unlikely, right?

41:46.791 --> 41:47.791
Hm.

41:49.000 --> 41:52.625
And the chances of your nightmare
coming true were like, what...

41:52.708 --> 41:54.291
one in a million?

41:54.375 --> 41:56.041
-One in a billion?
-I don't know, Liv.

41:56.125 --> 41:57.291
What are you trying to say?

41:57.375 --> 42:00.000
Grayson, I have
a terrible feeling about this.

42:01.083 --> 42:02.416
Why? What do you mean?

42:02.500 --> 42:04.041
We need to look at the book again.

42:04.125 --> 42:05.541
We might find something out.

42:07.500 --> 42:09.333
Whatever this is, it better be good.

42:13.375 --> 42:14.500
Bro, what's this about?

42:14.583 --> 42:16.166
I don't know,
just something about the book.

42:16.250 --> 42:18.000
-What are you looking for?
-The catch.

42:18.875 --> 42:20.958
The book didn't say anything
about a catch.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.000
[Liv] Well...

42:24.916 --> 42:26.500
-it does now.
-[Arthur] Wait, what?

42:26.583 --> 42:27.625
-[Grayson] What?
-Look.

42:27.708 --> 42:30.000
-[Jasper] Wait, that wasn't there before.
-I know. Look...

42:30.083 --> 42:31.666
"Your pure devotion will suffice.

42:31.750 --> 42:34.375
You'll see when you have
closed your eyes."

42:34.458 --> 42:35.750
-What the...?
-Closed your eyes?

42:35.833 --> 42:37.666
We only see the catch when we're dreaming.

42:37.750 --> 42:41.291
"All of your dreams shall soon be true,

42:41.375 --> 42:43.458
but your nightmares will be, too.

42:44.083 --> 42:45.958
As all of you must pay a price."

42:46.041 --> 42:47.958
[Grayson] I-- I... I hate this book.

42:48.041 --> 42:49.041
What if the book is listening?

42:49.125 --> 42:50.958
No, I don't think the book
is gonna hear me, Jazz.

42:51.041 --> 42:53.083
Well, if it can make things appear,
then I wouldn't be so sure about that.

42:53.166 --> 42:54.750
Five people, five nightmares.

42:54.833 --> 42:56.208
-Yours has come true.
-Yes.

42:56.291 --> 42:57.333
Yours as well.

42:57.416 --> 42:59.250
-[Henry] Everything's come true so far.
-[Grayson] Oh, yeah. I forgot about that.

42:59.333 --> 43:01.500
It's after midnight,
so it could be any one of us now.

43:01.583 --> 43:02.583
[Henry] Jasper,

43:02.666 --> 43:03.916
burnt his paper first.

43:04.000 --> 43:05.750
-Mm-hm.
-[Henry] Grayson went second.

43:05.833 --> 43:07.916
If it's following that pattern,
then who's next?

43:08.000 --> 43:09.000
Me.

43:10.875 --> 43:12.000
It's me.

43:13.583 --> 43:15.000
What is your worst nightmare?

43:18.708 --> 43:20.000
Okay. Erm...

43:22.750 --> 43:24.000
Mine's drowning...

43:24.666 --> 43:25.708
under ice.

43:26.625 --> 43:27.750
-[Henry] Shit!
-[Jasper] Jesus!

43:27.833 --> 43:29.833
[Grayson] Wow, that's
some fucked up nightmare.

43:29.916 --> 43:31.291
[Liv] And you?

43:31.375 --> 43:32.416
Mine's, er...

43:33.791 --> 43:35.000
losing all my teeth.

43:35.583 --> 43:36.625
-[scoffs] Bullshit.
-[Liv] Yeah, right.

43:36.708 --> 43:38.208
-Stop capping, bro.
-[Henry] It's literally number one.

43:38.291 --> 43:39.625
Everyone has that nightmare, mate.

43:39.708 --> 43:42.000
Guys, look at Persephone's door.

43:42.083 --> 43:43.583
-[distant rumbling]
-[Jasper] Whoa!

43:43.666 --> 43:44.666
No!

43:44.750 --> 43:46.750
-[Henry] What's this?
-[Liv] I think it's dissolving.

43:48.375 --> 43:49.500
[Jasper] Has this happened before?

43:49.583 --> 43:51.291
Have you guys
seen this happen before?

43:51.375 --> 43:52.375
[Arthur] It's happening.

43:53.041 --> 43:55.000
-[Liv] What is this?
-[Jasper] Arthur, what's happening?

43:55.916 --> 43:56.916
Arthur!

43:57.000 --> 43:58.541
I was the one that got Persephone
hooked on drugs.

43:58.625 --> 43:59.625
-Not deliberately.
-[Jasper] What?

43:59.708 --> 44:00.791
-[Henry] You did?
-Look, my worst nightmare

44:00.875 --> 44:03.166
was that she ODs and dies.

44:03.708 --> 44:04.833
-[Jasper] Shit!
-[Henry] Well, fuck!

44:04.916 --> 44:06.375
[Jasper] I'm sorry, I couldn't say...

44:06.458 --> 44:08.875
-[Liv] No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
-[Henry] Persephone's door.

44:08.958 --> 44:10.083
What are we gonna do now?

44:10.166 --> 44:12.625
Well, we have to find her. Like now!

44:12.708 --> 44:13.916
I think I know where she is.

44:14.000 --> 44:17.000
[dance music playing]

44:17.083 --> 44:18.500
[tyres screeching]

44:21.625 --> 44:24.750
[Arthur] Persephone? Persephone?

44:24.833 --> 44:26.208
[dance music playing]

44:26.291 --> 44:27.375
[Arthur] Persephone?

44:28.375 --> 44:30.250
-Persephone?
-She's not interested in you, mate.

44:30.333 --> 44:31.666
Bro, fuck off!

44:31.750 --> 44:33.291
Oh, Jesus. You okay?

44:36.500 --> 44:37.500
[Arthur] Persephone?

44:38.583 --> 44:40.000
[door creaks, thuds]

44:43.250 --> 44:46.833
[Arthur] Hey! Persephone! Persephone!
Persephone! Hey, hey!

44:48.750 --> 44:51.500
She's not-- She's not--
She's not breathing! She's not breathing!

44:52.000 --> 44:53.458
Call an ambulance now!

44:54.000 --> 44:55.083
Persephone!

44:55.166 --> 44:57.791
[breathing heavily]

45:14.375 --> 45:16.375
-[muffled] Liv. What happened?
-Are you all right?

45:16.458 --> 45:19.875
[muffled] She's dead... in the toilet.

45:20.416 --> 45:21.958
[muffled] Liv...

45:22.041 --> 45:24.000
[heavy breathing continues]

45:33.791 --> 45:37.000
[sombre music playing]

45:44.500 --> 45:46.166
[policeman] Yeah, she died of an overdose.

45:49.375 --> 45:51.791
[sirens blaring]

46:11.166 --> 46:12.166
What?

46:13.208 --> 46:14.208
"Liv Silver."

46:17.333 --> 46:18.583
[Florence] You look like death warmed up.

46:19.833 --> 46:21.000
I might be soon.

46:21.458 --> 46:23.416
Speaking of which, I read about your dad.

46:24.375 --> 46:26.166
He smashed through the ice five years ago.

46:26.958 --> 46:28.666
I wonder what killed him first.

46:29.291 --> 46:30.291
The cold?

46:31.416 --> 46:32.875
Or the lack of oxygen?

46:33.416 --> 46:34.791
Were you with him that day?

46:36.541 --> 46:37.875
What?

46:37.958 --> 46:39.041
I'm curious, that's all.

46:39.416 --> 46:42.291
-[Liv] You're sick.
-[Florence] I don't have an issue, Liv.

46:42.833 --> 46:45.375
[Mia, in German]
Come, Butter. Good girl.

46:45.458 --> 46:46.458
Liv?

46:47.041 --> 46:48.208
Where were you all night?

46:48.291 --> 46:50.000
I was worried about you.

46:50.083 --> 46:51.125
Yes, Butter.

46:54.000 --> 46:55.000
That's for you.

46:57.583 --> 46:59.000
Did you cry?

47:00.416 --> 47:01.416
Liv, what's going on?

47:04.000 --> 47:05.875
Persephone from school is dead.

47:05.958 --> 47:07.000
What?

47:08.125 --> 47:09.750
I just feel like

47:09.833 --> 47:11.458
it's all my fault. Again.

47:11.541 --> 47:14.000
Oh, no. Come here.

47:14.083 --> 47:15.708
It isn't your fault.

47:15.791 --> 47:17.541
Hey. It's okay.

47:17.625 --> 47:19.000
-It's okay.
-[sobbing]

47:23.583 --> 47:27.583
[principal, in English] I know right now,
the pain feels unimaginable.

47:28.416 --> 47:32.333
Persephone always inspired us
with her enthusiasm,

47:32.416 --> 47:35.208
-her ability to always keep going.
-This can't be.

47:36.000 --> 47:38.458
-[principal] And these are qualities...
-There must be a way to stop this.

47:38.541 --> 47:42.000
In the coming weeks, and months,

47:42.083 --> 47:44.708
love each other, support each other,

47:44.791 --> 47:47.000
and day by day, it will get easier.

47:49.166 --> 47:50.875
[Jasper] Okay, like, er...
but would this help us get,

47:50.958 --> 47:52.083
I don't know, like, un-cursed.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.500
-There's this.
-[Henry] We can't kill a chicken, Jazz.

47:54.583 --> 47:55.916
Is it technically black magic?

47:56.000 --> 47:57.708
This is something
about taking bath salts,

47:57.791 --> 47:58.958
-but I just...
-Or we can smoke it out.

47:59.041 --> 48:02.291
Er, like a sage bundle.
Er, use a feather or wave,

48:02.375 --> 48:03.708
or get rid of negative energy,

48:03.791 --> 48:06.291
negative entities, evil spirits...
[indistinct]

48:06.375 --> 48:07.708
[Grayson] Yeah, that sounds witchy.

48:07.791 --> 48:09.916
I don't think smoke will help us
break this curse...

48:10.000 --> 48:11.125
-[Liv] Erm...
-[Henry] Maybe we should get an exorcist.

48:11.208 --> 48:13.750
Guys, there's something missing here.

48:13.833 --> 48:14.833
In the book?

48:15.208 --> 48:16.208
Yeah.

48:17.250 --> 48:20.000
Look, there's obviously a page missing.

48:21.083 --> 48:23.666
Here, "For your nightmares to reverse,

48:23.750 --> 48:26.041
there are two ways to lift the curse."

48:26.125 --> 48:27.250
And this is gone.

48:27.333 --> 48:29.041
-Who would do that?
-Who the fuck did that?

48:29.125 --> 48:30.250
-Anabel.
-[Grayson] What?

48:30.333 --> 48:31.833
-[Jasper] She's alive?
-Of course she is.

48:31.916 --> 48:32.916
Do you know where she is?

48:33.375 --> 48:35.166
Anabel spent so much time in her dreams,

48:35.250 --> 48:36.791
she loved it more than real life.

48:36.875 --> 48:38.541
Okay. And, so...

48:38.625 --> 48:40.000
So it got to a point where she didn't know

48:40.083 --> 48:41.416
what was real
and what was a dream anymore.

48:41.500 --> 48:42.583
Okay, what's the point?

48:42.666 --> 48:44.208
-She tried jumping off a bridge.
-[Grayson] What the hell?

48:44.291 --> 48:45.291
Why would she do that?

48:45.375 --> 48:46.916
[Arthur] She thought she was
waking herself up, in real life.

48:47.000 --> 48:48.541
Wait, why are you telling this now?

48:48.625 --> 48:49.916
Well, thankfully, she failed.

48:50.000 --> 48:51.416
-[Grayson] Yeah, thankfully.
-[Henry] Jesus.

48:51.500 --> 48:53.583
And now she's recovering
in a mental institution.

48:53.666 --> 48:56.500
-Great. So, where is she?
-Which hospital?

48:56.583 --> 48:57.916
I promised her I wouldn't tell anyone.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.708
-[Grayson] Not even us?
-[Jasper] For fuck's sake.

48:59.791 --> 49:02.333
Aren't you, like,
proud of your shitty secret?

49:02.416 --> 49:03.416
Hey.

49:05.625 --> 49:07.291
[Grayson] I told you it was a bad idea.

49:07.375 --> 49:09.083
-All of it, the whole fucking game.
-If you know where Anabel is,

49:09.666 --> 49:12.583
and she knows where that page is,
we need to get it.

49:12.666 --> 49:14.625
It's the only way that we can clear up
that mess that we made.

49:15.083 --> 49:17.583
We won't do shit, Liv.
I'll do it.

49:17.666 --> 49:19.541
-No, we're fucking coming with you!
-[Arthur] No, you're not.

49:19.625 --> 49:20.833
We obviously can't trust you.

49:20.916 --> 49:23.666
I know Anabel, okay?
I know her better than anyone here.

49:23.750 --> 49:25.916
She doesn't even know you, Liv.
She wouldn't even talk to you.

49:26.000 --> 49:27.000
You'd be surprised.

49:28.250 --> 49:30.000
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

49:31.416 --> 49:32.416
Go! What are you waiting for?

49:32.500 --> 49:34.750
They have visiting hours.
If she has it, I'll go then.

49:34.833 --> 49:36.000
Oh, yeah.

49:36.541 --> 49:39.750
Great. Let's just, er, sit around
and waste time.

49:39.833 --> 49:42.875
Do you understand
that if we don't do this, I die?!

49:44.000 --> 49:45.916
I'm not fucking stupid, Liv.
Of course I know that.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.416
Do you even want to reverse the curse?

49:48.500 --> 49:49.708
Are you serious?

49:50.750 --> 49:52.791
-My cousin is dead, you fucking bitch.
-[Henry] Hey, watch it!

49:53.208 --> 49:54.416
Why, is she your girlfriend now?

49:54.500 --> 49:56.291
It's not her fault your cousin
got hooked on drugs, mate.

49:56.375 --> 49:57.541
Are you fucking mad?!

-Hey, hey, hey! Stop it! Stop it!
-Say that again!

49:59.375 --> 50:01.458

-Maybe if you knew how to fucking read...

50:01.541 --> 50:03.333
-[Jasper] Okay, I'm sorry, man.
-[Arthur] Don't touch me!

[nurse 1] I'm sorry.
That's a confidential information.

50:12.458 --> 50:13.458
Ah, I understand.

50:15.625 --> 50:19.666
So, I really want to see her.
Is there any possibility I can come visit?

50:19.750 --> 50:22.541
[nurse 2] I'm really sorry, miss.
You'll have to come back.

50:23.708 --> 50:24.916

So, if I only come for, like, two minutes.
I swear, just two minutes

50:29.250 --> 50:33.000
and that's, erm, that's it.
I'll leave, after two minutes. I promise.

01:01:53.375 --> 01:01:54.708
-[Jasper] What?
-Wow.

01:01:54.791 --> 01:01:56.583
-I don't need anyone.
-[Jasper] Wait, where you going?

01:01:56.666 --> 01:01:57.666
Wait...

01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:59.541
Ugh, that's what you get, man.

01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:01.875
[teacher] Make sure
you keep your goggles on

01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:03.500
at the Bunsen Burners please.

01:02:03.583 --> 01:02:05.708
[indistinct chatter]

01:02:08.166 --> 01:02:10.458
[teacher] Jackie, can you tie
your hair back please, thank you.

01:02:10.541 --> 01:02:11.625
How's it going?

01:02:12.125 --> 01:02:13.416
What are you doing here, Silver?

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:15.000
You found anything out?

01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:17.541
She refused to see me.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Hm.

01:02:45.666 --> 01:02:46.666
[phone clatters]

01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:48.416
You're really starting to get
on my last fucking nerve.

01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.500
I'm sorry. So sorry.

01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:51.291
[Arthur] For fuck's sake.

01:02:51.375 --> 01:02:53.416
[grunting, groaning]

01:03:03.125 --> 01:03:04.166
Okay.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:07.625
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:03:13.666 --> 01:03:16.000
[thunder rumbling]

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Okay.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Yes.

01:03:38.625 --> 01:03:41.833
[ethereal music playing]

01:04:04.333 --> 01:04:05.583
[in German] Where are you?

01:04:15.041 --> 01:04:17.291
[in English] "Sacrifice of the maiden.

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:21.666
On the blood moon night,
when everyone has paid their price,

01:04:21.750 --> 01:04:23.708
you'll make the final sacrifice.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:28.041
Kill the maiden in dream's core
and be a dreamer evermore.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.625
But if the maiden turns around,

01:04:31.708 --> 01:04:34.375
destroys the book on dreamer's ground,

01:04:35.083 --> 01:04:38.708
the doors shall close and end the curse

01:04:38.791 --> 01:04:41.208
and all the nightmares be reversed."

01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:42.916
[Arthur] Liv... Liv!

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:46.000
-Shit!
-What the fuck do you think you're doing?

01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:50.333
-Liv, come back here!
-[Liv gasps]

01:04:52.166 --> 01:04:53.541
You fucking bitch!

01:04:56.708 --> 01:04:57.708
[door thuds]

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:04.833
Fuck!

01:05:07.458 --> 01:05:08.500
Open up, open!

01:05:15.166 --> 01:05:18.041
Arthur wants to sacrifice the maiden
on the blood moon night,

01:05:18.125 --> 01:05:20.000
so that he can enter anyone's dream,

01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.000
-all over the world, forever.
-That's insane.

01:05:22.916 --> 01:05:24.041
We can't let him succeed.

01:05:24.125 --> 01:05:25.125
He won't.

01:05:25.208 --> 01:05:27.416
Not if the maiden destroys the book first.

01:05:27.500 --> 01:05:28.708
I'll wake up, and I'll get it.

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:30.416
Wait, we don't know which maiden it is.

01:05:30.958 --> 01:05:32.000
Me or you?

01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:35.541
-You're right.
-We have to do it together.

01:05:36.458 --> 01:05:37.916
[Arthur] Liv! Liv!

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.750
Liv, wake up! Liv!

01:05:39.833 --> 01:05:41.125
Wake up!

01:05:41.208 --> 01:05:42.583
-Liv.
-Hm?

01:05:44.458 --> 01:05:46.250
You fucking kidding me?

01:05:46.333 --> 01:05:47.583
Are you real?

01:05:49.375 --> 01:05:50.583
Fucking joke.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.500
-Hey, man, please just text her to--
-[Liv] Grayson!

01:05:58.583 --> 01:06:00.666
-What?
-Okay, this might sound crazy.

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:01.750
What?

01:06:02.291 --> 01:06:03.875
I read the missing page in Arthur's dream.

01:06:03.958 --> 01:06:05.500
Liv, how did you get in his dream?

01:06:05.583 --> 01:06:07.250
-Okay, listen, hear me out.
-What?

01:06:07.333 --> 01:06:09.291
This is me trusting you right now, okay?

01:06:09.625 --> 01:06:10.625
Okay.

01:06:10.708 --> 01:06:13.000
If the maiden destroys the book
on the blood moon,

01:06:13.083 --> 01:06:14.125
which is tonight...

01:06:15.625 --> 01:06:17.041
then all the curses get reversed.

01:06:17.125 --> 01:06:19.708
-Okay, Liv, that's a good thing.
-Yes.

01:06:19.791 --> 01:06:21.375
Okay, all we need is to get the book then.

01:06:22.041 --> 01:06:23.666
Yeah, of course, you just have it already.

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:25.208
Yep, and I need your car.

01:06:25.291 --> 01:06:27.125
Hm... you don't know how to drive.

01:06:27.625 --> 01:06:28.666
That's why I need you.

01:06:28.750 --> 01:06:29.958
Let's go. Come on.

01:06:35.625 --> 01:06:38.125
Okay. So, just, let me get this straight.

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:43.166
We break Anabel
out of the mental hospital...

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:44.500
-Correct.
-...so that the maidens

01:06:44.583 --> 01:06:45.583
can destroy the book,

01:06:45.666 --> 01:06:47.208
-and reverse all the nightmares.
-Yeah.

01:06:47.291 --> 01:06:49.000
-That's the plan now, okay?
-In a nutshell.

01:06:49.583 --> 01:06:51.250
Got it. Got it.

01:06:53.583 --> 01:06:54.916
[exhales]

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.250
-Can you drive any faster?
-No, I can't drive any faster.

01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.750
[car horn honking]

01:06:59.833 --> 01:07:02.791
[dramatic music playing]

01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:04.916
[tyres screeching]

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:09.208
Keep the engine running.

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:10.416
No! I'm--

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.000
Liv, I'm coming with you.

01:07:13.208 --> 01:07:15.541
[Grayson] Okay. So, I'll just...
I'll stay here, then.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.416
Excuse me. Miss. Can I help you?

01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:24.791
Visiting hours are done for the day.

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:28.541
Yes, I'm actually the new doctor
from Berlin.

01:07:29.208 --> 01:07:31.500
Hm. What was your name?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Dr Franka Stein.

01:07:34.083 --> 01:07:35.166
Frankenstein?

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:38.291
And I suppose
you're here to see... Dracula.

01:07:39.333 --> 01:07:40.500
-Hm.
-Miss...

01:07:40.583 --> 01:07:42.000
this is a hospital for sick people.

01:07:42.958 --> 01:07:44.208
I'm gonna need you to leave.

01:07:44.291 --> 01:07:45.291
Fine.

01:07:46.583 --> 01:07:48.166
I need to get one of your patients out,

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:51.125
otherwise, I'll be sacrificed
in a sick blood ritual tonight

01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:53.458
and literally, my worst nightmare
will come true.

01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:54.541
Okay.

01:07:55.125 --> 01:07:56.416
Let me get you a doctor.

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:58.541
Please, take a seat over there.

01:07:58.625 --> 01:08:00.500
-Thank you.
-No problem.

01:08:08.583 --> 01:08:11.333
-Anabel. Anabel. Anabel.
-[mouse clicking]

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:20.750
[door closes]

01:08:36.832 --> 01:08:38.457
-[Liv] Found you.
-Oh, my God!

01:08:39.625 --> 01:08:42.625
-Oh. Erm, we need to be quick.
-You're my hero.

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:44.457
Show me the book.

01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:47.625
-Drink something.
-Thanks.

01:08:51.875 --> 01:08:52.875
Come on!

01:09:04.250 --> 01:09:05.707
-Oh, shit! What are they doing here?
-[Grayson] Guys, I had no choice.

01:09:05.791 --> 01:09:07.207
She figured it all out.

01:09:07.291 --> 01:09:08.375
-[Anabel] I told you you can't trust them.
-[Arthur] So, wanna play a game

01:09:08.457 --> 01:09:09.457
with fucking Anabel!

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.416
You know if she escapes,
and Anabel, too, it's over.

01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:13.500
Yeah, I do know that.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:15.166
-We need to get out of here.
-[Grayson] And I warned you guys.

01:09:15.875 --> 01:09:17.291
[Anabel] Let's check the backdoor.

01:09:25.457 --> 01:09:27.000
[Anabel] Let's try Arthur's car.

01:09:36.666 --> 01:09:37.666
He left the key.

01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:40.082
-Now he's definitely gonna kill us both.
-Maybe.

01:09:40.166 --> 01:09:42.082
[tyres screech]

01:09:42.582 --> 01:09:44.707
Liv! [gasps] Liv!

01:09:44.791 --> 01:09:45.832
-[engine revs]
-[Liv] Go!

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:48.916
-[tyres screeching]
-[engine roaring]

01:09:55.583 --> 01:09:57.208
[dramatic music playing]

01:10:02.833 --> 01:10:03.875
[tyres screech]

01:10:03.958 --> 01:10:05.000
Anabel?

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Anabel?

01:10:09.375 --> 01:10:10.416
[Liv] Whoa!

01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.833
-[tyres screeching]
-[horn blaring]

01:10:11.916 --> 01:10:13.333
-[Anabel laughing]
-[loud clang]

01:10:13.416 --> 01:10:14.583
[heavy thudding]

01:10:14.666 --> 01:10:15.916
Oh, my God! Grayson!

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.291
Stop the car! Stop the car!

01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:20.375
Anabel, slow down! You're gonna kill us!

01:10:20.458 --> 01:10:21.625
Not us...

01:10:22.125 --> 01:10:23.250
just you.

01:10:23.333 --> 01:10:24.333
What?

01:10:24.791 --> 01:10:26.875
You have to die tonight. I'm sorry.

01:10:30.250 --> 01:10:31.666
Is this a dream?

01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:33.333
It's your dream, to be exact.

01:10:35.666 --> 01:10:38.250
-When did I fall asleep?
-Quite a while ago.

01:10:38.333 --> 01:10:40.666
I drugged you when you came into my room.

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:43.083
The water. You're an arsehole

01:10:43.166 --> 01:10:44.333
Please mind your language.

01:10:44.416 --> 01:10:46.750
You hid the missing page
in Arthur's dream.

01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:47.958
[Anabel] Took you a while.

01:10:48.041 --> 01:10:50.416
All I had to do was vanish.

01:10:51.291 --> 01:10:54.000
So the boys would start looking
for another maiden to replace me.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:55.791
-[horn blares]
-[tyres screech]

01:10:55.875 --> 01:10:58.625
If you crash the car,
you're gonna die as well.

01:10:58.708 --> 01:11:00.916
No, you replaced me as maiden.

01:11:03.375 --> 01:11:04.666
I'm just gonna wake up.

01:11:05.666 --> 01:11:06.958
[Anabel chuckling]

01:11:07.916 --> 01:11:09.541
[Anabel laughs]

01:11:10.458 --> 01:11:12.875
You know what?
You're fucking insane!

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:14.291
[laughing]

01:11:15.375 --> 01:11:17.541
[tyres screeching]

01:11:19.791 --> 01:11:21.416
No, no, no, no, no.

01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.833
-Where is it?
-What are you doing, Liv?

01:11:23.916 --> 01:11:26.125
You'll die tonight anyway.
Awake or asleep.

01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:28.791
It's your nightmare, remember?

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.375
I'll happily watch you die.

01:11:33.458 --> 01:11:34.583
I know the rules.

01:11:34.666 --> 01:11:36.000
If I jump in a dream,

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.541
I'll wake up before I hit the ground,
so I'm not gonna die.

01:11:38.625 --> 01:11:40.000
Yes, but you're the maiden.

01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:43.625
How can you be so sure you won't die
on this special night?

01:11:43.708 --> 01:11:45.708
-[truck horn blaring]
-[car horn honking]

01:11:55.125 --> 01:11:56.125
You're bluffing.

01:11:56.666 --> 01:12:00.000
If you really don't want me to jump,
then it's the right thing to do.

01:12:00.083 --> 01:12:01.416
You're forgetting something.

01:12:04.375 --> 01:12:06.791
My anchor, it's not gonna help you much
when I'm awake.

01:12:07.458 --> 01:12:08.791
Doesn't only belong to you.

01:12:12.166 --> 01:12:13.708
If you don't step down from there,

01:12:13.791 --> 01:12:15.958
I'll have to torture your sweet
little sister in her dreams

01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:17.208
until she dies.

01:12:20.083 --> 01:12:21.083
You want this?

01:12:22.916 --> 01:12:24.041
Okay, I'll come dow--

01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:25.333
[screaming]

01:12:25.416 --> 01:12:27.625
[truck horn blaring]

01:12:27.708 --> 01:12:28.750
[screaming]

01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:30.000
[gasps]

01:12:30.708 --> 01:12:32.625
[thudding]

01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:35.333
Help!

01:12:35.416 --> 01:12:36.416
Liv?

01:12:37.291 --> 01:12:38.625
[Liv] Grayson! I'm here!

01:12:39.375 --> 01:12:40.500
She drugged me!

01:12:40.583 --> 01:12:41.958
-[doors creaking]
-Hey!

01:12:42.666 --> 01:12:44.250
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.000
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:12:47.625 --> 01:12:48.708
Okay.

01:12:49.416 --> 01:12:52.000
Anabel said she was going
to go into Mia's dream.

01:12:52.666 --> 01:12:54.291
-We need to find her.
-I'll text the others.

01:12:54.375 --> 01:12:55.458
