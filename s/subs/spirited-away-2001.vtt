WEBVTT

00:07.090 --> 00:10.759
Tokuma Shoten, Studio Ghibli, Nippon Television Network,
Dentsu, Walt Disney Japan, Tohokushinsha Film
and Mitsubishi present

00:13.346 --> 00:15.889
Good luck, Chihiro
Hope we meet again

00:16.099 --> 00:18.892
Chihiro? Chihiro!

00:19.102 --> 00:20.561
We're almost there.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.482
This really is the middle of nowhere.

00:25.608 --> 00:28.402
I'll have to shop in the next town.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.612
We'll just have to make do.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.034
Look, there's the elementary school.

00:35.160 --> 00:36.952
That's your new school, Chihiro.

00:37.829 --> 00:40.080
Why, it looks very nice.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.923
I liked my old school.

00:54.137 --> 00:56.972
Mom, my flowers got bent.

00:57.223 --> 00:59.683
No wonder,
the way you squeeze them.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.770
A little water
and they'll perk right up.

01:03.813 --> 01:07.399
My first bouquet,
and it's farewell flowers.

01:07.525 --> 01:10.986
What about the rose
you got for your birthday?

01:11.112 --> 01:14.114
One rose?
One rose isn't a bouquet.

01:14.282 --> 01:15.908
You dropped the card.

01:16.034 --> 01:20.412
Now pull yourself together.
This is a busy day for us.

01:39.641 --> 01:44.812
SPIRITED AWAY

01:57.200 --> 02:01.161
Wait a minute.
Did I take a wrong turn?

02:01.621 --> 02:03.080
I don't get it.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.332
That must be it up there.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.210
The blue one on the end.

02:08.628 --> 02:09.962
That's it.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.048
I guess I turned off too soon.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.175
Maybe if we go straight?

02:15.343 --> 02:17.845
Oh, please.
That's how we always get lost.

02:17.971 --> 02:19.972
Let's just see what's up here.

02:20.390 --> 02:24.017
- What are those things?
- Houses for the guardian spirits.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.484
Dad, are you sure?

02:32.610 --> 02:35.195
Don't worry, we've got 4-wheel drive.

02:35.738 --> 02:37.156
Sit down, Chihiro.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.636
What are you doing? Slow down!

03:01.139 --> 03:02.472
There's a tunnel.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.655
What's this building?

03:18.781 --> 03:20.616
It looks like a gate.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.578
Honey, I think we should go back.

03:25.246 --> 03:26.622
Chihiro!

03:28.208 --> 03:29.124
Honestly...

03:29.542 --> 03:31.877
Look at this, it's just plaster.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.087
This thing's pretty new.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.599
The air's blowing in.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.184
What is it?

03:47.310 --> 03:49.603
Let's see what's on the other side.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.356
It's creepy, Dad.
Can't we go back?

03:52.815 --> 03:56.777
Don't be such a chicken.
C'mon, let's take a look.

03:56.945 --> 03:59.112
The movers will be there soon.

03:59.239 --> 04:03.283
So? They've got the keys.
They'll handle everything.

04:03.409 --> 04:04.451
I know, but...

04:04.577 --> 04:06.536
No! I won't go.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.582
Dad, let's go.

04:10.708 --> 04:12.167
Come on, it'll be fun.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.002
I'm staying here!

04:22.262 --> 04:24.763
Chihiro, you wait in the car.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.600
Mom...

04:30.520 --> 04:31.895
Wait up!

04:37.443 --> 04:39.069
Watch your step.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.531
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.

05:14.564 --> 05:17.858
- What is this?
- Wait, hear that?

05:26.659 --> 05:29.536
- A train.
- Maybe we're near a station.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.538
Let's find out.
It must be close.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.494
Houses, way out here?

06:10.620 --> 06:12.245
I knew it.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.415
It's an abandoned theme park.

06:17.210 --> 06:20.587
They built lots of them
back in the nineties.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.256
But they went bust
when the economy tanked.

06:23.591 --> 06:25.926
This must be one of them.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.011
Wait, where are we going?

06:28.137 --> 06:30.764
Let's go back, Dad.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.394
Please!

06:44.987 --> 06:47.906
Mom, that building's moaning.

06:48.157 --> 06:49.241
It's just the wind.

06:49.742 --> 06:54.246
What a lovely spot.
We should've brought the sandwiches.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.126
This would've been a river.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.258
Do you smell something?

07:07.009 --> 07:10.178
- Something smells good.
- You're right.

07:10.304 --> 07:13.098
Maybe they're open
for business after all.

07:13.433 --> 07:14.975
Hurry up, Chihiro.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.185
Wait for me!

07:50.178 --> 07:51.636
This way.

07:55.808 --> 07:59.186
Can you believe it?
Nothing but restaurants.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.521
There's nobody here.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.484
Over there.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.823
Come on!

08:22.919 --> 08:24.544
Come take a look.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.299
This is amazing.

08:29.425 --> 08:32.344
Hello, is anybody here?

08:32.470 --> 08:34.888
Come on, Chihiro.
It looks delicious.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.348
You got customers!

08:41.354 --> 08:44.814
Don't worry.
We'll pay when they show up.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.484
You're right.
Let's see now...

08:47.610 --> 08:49.736
What kind of bird is this?

08:51.447 --> 08:54.366
It's delicious! Chihiro, try some.

08:54.867 --> 08:55.867
I don't want any.

08:56.077 --> 08:58.995
Can't we go?
They'll be mad at us.

08:59.288 --> 09:02.415
Don't worry, your father's here.

09:02.583 --> 09:04.709
I've got credit cards and cash.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.383
Have some, Chihiro.
It's very tender.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.095
- Mustard.
- Thanks.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.483
Mom! Dad!

10:37.803 --> 10:39.387
What a weird building.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.919
A train!

11:21.514 --> 11:23.390
You can't be here.
Go now!

11:24.433 --> 11:27.394
It's almost sundown.
Go before it gets dark!

11:30.064 --> 11:32.190
They're lighting the lamps.
Come on!

11:32.316 --> 11:34.901
I'll hold them off.
Get across the river!

11:49.125 --> 11:51.251
What's his problem?

11:59.719 --> 12:00.969
Dad?

12:01.971 --> 12:03.596
Dad, let's go home.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.473
Let's go, Dad!

12:32.251 --> 12:33.752
Dad!

12:34.253 --> 12:35.295
Mom!

12:44.764 --> 12:46.765
Mommy!

13:08.621 --> 13:09.829
Water!

13:23.219 --> 13:24.511
No...

13:24.637 --> 13:26.387
It's just a dream.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.267
Wake up, wake up.
Wake up!

13:32.478 --> 13:34.270
Please wake up.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.028
It's just a dream, a stupid dream.

13:42.571 --> 13:45.114
Go away, disappear.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.908
Disappear.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.417
I'm fading away!

13:59.338 --> 14:01.673
This has to be a dream.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.769
Don't be afraid.
I'm a friend.

14:57.187 --> 14:58.938
No, no, no!

14:59.356 --> 15:01.065
Open your mouth. Eat this.

15:01.275 --> 15:04.027
Unless you eat something
from this world, you'll disappear.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.445
No!

15:09.533 --> 15:12.619
Don't worry.
You won't turn into a pig.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.621
Chew it and swallow.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.633
Good, now you'll be fine.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.468
See for yourself.

15:36.685 --> 15:37.936
I can touch you.

15:38.062 --> 15:40.355
Of course.
Now come.

15:40.481 --> 15:44.484
Where's Mom and Dad?
Did they really turn into pigs?

15:44.777 --> 15:47.236
You can't see them now,
but you will.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.532
Quiet!

16:09.677 --> 16:12.887
It's looking for you.
There's no time, let's run.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.683
I can't stand up.
What should I do?

16:16.934 --> 16:20.728
- My legs don't work.
- Relax and take a deep breath.

16:24.358 --> 16:28.611
In the name of the wind and
water within, unbind her.

16:28.862 --> 16:29.862
Stand up!

17:12.197 --> 17:15.116
Don't breathe while we're on the bridge.

17:16.410 --> 17:21.497
One tiny breath will break my spell.
We don't want anyone to see you.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.212
I'm scared.

17:28.338 --> 17:29.881
Be calm.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.051
Welcome, your presence honors us.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.386
Greetings, welcome.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.890
- I've finished my rounds.
- Welcome back, sir.

17:40.100 --> 17:41.851
Take a deep breath.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.103
Hold it.

18:01.121 --> 18:04.791
Welcome back.
We've been waiting for you.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.877
Just a little further.

18:08.796 --> 18:10.379
Master Haku!

18:11.131 --> 18:12.757
Where have you...

18:14.218 --> 18:15.968
A human?

18:16.887 --> 18:18.096
Run!

18:34.655 --> 18:36.948
Master Haku, Master Haku!

18:37.074 --> 18:39.700
I smell something.
A human intruder!

18:39.827 --> 18:42.078
I smell humans!
The stench of humans!

18:42.204 --> 18:44.872
- They know you're here.
- Sorry, I messed up.

18:44.998 --> 18:47.166
No, Chihiro, you did very well.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.919
Now listen.
I'll tell you what to do.

18:50.087 --> 18:51.671
If you stay here, they'll find you.

18:52.339 --> 18:55.633
I'll distract them while you get away.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.177
No, don't go!
Stay with me, please.

18:58.846 --> 19:01.848
You have no choice,
if you want to survive here...

19:01.974 --> 19:03.683
and save your parents, too.

19:04.726 --> 19:07.353
So I wasn't dreaming.
They did turn into pigs.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.938
Listen carefully.

19:09.857 --> 19:13.317
After I'm gone,
go through the back gate.

19:13.443 --> 19:16.320
Take the stairs
all the way down.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.573
You'll find
the boiler room where...

19:18.699 --> 19:20.199
they stoke the fires.

19:20.367 --> 19:23.661
Look for Kamaji.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.163
Kamaji?

19:26.373 --> 19:28.624
Ask him for work.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.418
If he refuses, keep asking.

19:31.003 --> 19:34.422
If you don't work,
Yubaba will turn you into an animal.

19:34.882 --> 19:36.048
Yubaba?

19:36.216 --> 19:38.926
She's the sorceress who rules our world.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.471
She'll try to trick you into leaving...

19:42.598 --> 19:44.182
but keep asking for work.

19:44.516 --> 19:49.145
The work's hard, but it will protect you.
Then even Yubaba can't harm you.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.191
Master Haku, Master Haku!

19:53.483 --> 19:54.609
I have to go.

19:54.735 --> 19:58.946
- Remember I'm your friend, Chihiro.
- How did you know my name?

19:59.406 --> 20:01.449
You told me long ago.

20:01.742 --> 20:03.701
My name is Haku.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.414
Here I am!

20:10.334 --> 20:12.627
Master Haku, Yubaba's waiting.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.755
I know, I've been searching too.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.796
Um...

24:26.673 --> 24:28.007
Excuse me.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.182
Um...

24:42.898 --> 24:45.232
Are you Kamaji?

24:53.033 --> 24:56.702
Haku sent me.
Please let me work here.

25:01.124 --> 25:04.543
What, all at once?

25:05.212 --> 25:07.463
Get to work, you little runts!

25:09.049 --> 25:13.928
I am Kamaji, slave to the boilers
that heat the baths.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.222
Step on it, boys!

25:17.390 --> 25:19.475
Please let me work here.

25:19.601 --> 25:23.854
I've got all the help I need.
There's soot everywhere.

25:23.980 --> 25:26.899
I'll never run out of help.

25:41.331 --> 25:43.332
Oh, I'm sorry.

25:47.003 --> 25:49.088
Wait a second.

26:00.934 --> 26:02.434
Out of the way.

26:55.488 --> 26:57.740
Wait, what do I do with this?

27:04.456 --> 27:06.123
Do I leave it here?

27:06.499 --> 27:08.626
Finish what you start.

28:08.269 --> 28:12.064
Get to work, runts!
Wanna turn back into soot?

28:12.232 --> 28:15.901
And you, better watch it.
You can't just take someone's work.

28:16.069 --> 28:19.571
If they don't work,
their spell will be broken.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.825
There's no work for you here.
Try somewhere else.

28:31.835 --> 28:34.336
You sootballs got a problem?

28:34.462 --> 28:35.963
Get to work!

28:37.006 --> 28:38.632
Chow time!

28:38.925 --> 28:41.343
What, you guys at it again?

28:43.263 --> 28:46.181
Give it a rest.
Where's your bowl?

28:47.142 --> 28:49.143
I keep telling you to leave it out.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.937
Food's here.
Break time!

29:07.537 --> 29:09.663
The human! You're gonna catch it.

29:09.789 --> 29:11.999
They're having a fit about it upstairs.

29:13.209 --> 29:15.002
She's my granddaughter.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.587
Your granddaughter!

29:17.464 --> 29:21.175
She says she wants work,
but I don't need any help.

29:21.301 --> 29:24.803
Could you take her
to Yubaba for me?

29:24.971 --> 29:26.764
This girl can handle herself.

29:26.890 --> 29:29.308
Not a chance.
Yubaba would kill me.

29:29.434 --> 29:34.229
Not even for this?
Charcoal-roasted newt, finest quality.

29:36.357 --> 29:40.319
If you want work, you have to
sign a contract with Yubaba.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.654
Might as well try your luck.

29:43.823 --> 29:46.658
Fine!
You there, follow me.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.501
What about
"Yes, ma'am" or "Thank you"?

29:55.627 --> 29:57.002
Yes, ma'am.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.504
What a klutz.
Move it!

29:58.630 --> 29:59.588
Yes, ma'am.

30:02.217 --> 30:05.260
Leave the shoes.
And the socks!

30:05.386 --> 30:06.553
Yes'm.

30:11.935 --> 30:15.979
Aren't you going to thank Kamaji?
He's looking out for you.

30:18.191 --> 30:20.150
Thank you very much.

30:21.611 --> 30:22.986
Good luck.

30:32.539 --> 30:35.541
Yubaba lives on
the top floor in the back.

30:50.056 --> 30:52.391
Move it, will you?

30:56.688 --> 30:58.272
You'll lose your nose.

31:23.089 --> 31:25.799
- One more elevator after this.
- Yes'm.

31:30.221 --> 31:31.430
We're here.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.143
Welcome, sir!

31:42.108 --> 31:46.528
This elevator stops here.
Please use another one.

32:09.260 --> 32:11.678
- He's following us.
- Quit gawking.

32:26.986 --> 32:29.363
Here we are.

32:34.035 --> 32:36.620
Your room is on the right.

32:39.332 --> 32:41.625
- Lin?
- Yes sir!

32:43.169 --> 32:44.962
Something smells.

32:45.546 --> 32:47.798
It's human.
You reek of human.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.257
Is that so?

32:49.509 --> 32:52.719
I smell it, I do.
Smells mighty tasty, too.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.722
You're hiding something.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.183
Tell me the truth.

32:58.351 --> 32:59.601
Maybe it's this.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.354
Roasted newt? Give it here!

33:02.522 --> 33:05.732
Not a chance.
The girls asked me to get it.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.986
I'm begging you.
I'll settle for a leg.

33:10.029 --> 33:12.990
Pull the lever to go up, sir.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.347
Can't you even knock?

35:01.140 --> 35:04.101
What a plain little girl.

35:14.362 --> 35:16.363
Now, come.

35:19.784 --> 35:21.743
I said, come!

35:36.300 --> 35:38.468
Ow...

35:48.813 --> 35:51.690
What a racket.
Could you be quiet?

36:10.710 --> 36:11.835
Please...

36:12.211 --> 36:14.337
Let me work here.

36:22.805 --> 36:25.891
Stop your babbling.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.311
Why do I need
a weakling like you?

36:29.562 --> 36:33.815
Besides, this is no place for humans.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.319
Millions of spirits come here...

36:37.445 --> 36:41.281
to purge themselves of toil and care.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.410
Your parents, my goodness!
They certainly had some nerve.

36:45.536 --> 36:49.122
Gobbling our guests' food
like a couple of pigs.

36:49.248 --> 36:51.374
Just deserts, I'd say.

36:51.918 --> 36:57.214
And as for you, you'll never
see your world again either.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.762
You'd make a lovely piglet.

37:04.096 --> 37:06.973
Or perhaps a lump of coal?

37:14.774 --> 37:16.358
Trembling, aren't you?

37:16.484 --> 37:20.111
Still, I'm impressed
you made it this far.

37:20.238 --> 37:23.490
Someone must've helped you.

37:23.783 --> 37:25.867
I must thank your friend.

37:25.993 --> 37:30.622
Just who was it, my dear?
You can tell me.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.168
Please let me work here!

37:35.294 --> 37:36.836
Not that again!

37:36.963 --> 37:38.380
I want to work here!

37:38.714 --> 37:43.635
Shut your mouth!

37:47.265 --> 37:51.059
Why on earth should I hire you?

37:51.185 --> 37:55.480
Anyone can see you're
a lazy, spoiled, stupid crybaby.

37:55.648 --> 38:00.652
What job would I possibly have
for someone like you?

38:00.778 --> 38:06.658
You're wasting your time.
I've got all the bums I need.

38:07.576 --> 38:11.830
Or maybe I'll give you
the nastiest job I've got...

38:11.956 --> 38:13.999
and work you night and day...

38:14.125 --> 38:19.045
until you breathe your very last breath!

38:31.600 --> 38:34.853
Now, now.
What's wrong, my dear?

38:35.688 --> 38:38.356
I'm coming.
That's a good baby.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.359
Are you still here?
Get out, right now.

38:41.652 --> 38:43.403
I want to work here!

38:43.696 --> 38:47.115
Keep your voice down.

38:47.241 --> 38:50.910
I'll be right there, just be patient.

38:51.829 --> 38:54.414
That's a good baby.
There, there.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.791
Please give me a job!

38:56.917 --> 38:59.711
All right, just pipe down.

39:00.046 --> 39:04.591
There, there, good baby.

39:24.695 --> 39:26.446
That's your contract.

39:27.281 --> 39:29.449
Sign on the bottom line.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.576
I'll put you to work.

39:32.244 --> 39:35.163
But one peep out of you
about anything...

39:35.289 --> 39:37.749
and I'll turn you into a piglet.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.502
Should I sign here?

39:40.628 --> 39:44.130
Where else?
Quit dilly-dallying.

39:48.761 --> 39:50.929
Unbelievable.

39:51.430 --> 39:54.265
What a ridiculous oath I took.

39:55.684 --> 39:59.270
I'm bound to give work
to whoever asks.

40:01.607 --> 40:03.400
- Finished?
- Yes.

40:08.280 --> 40:10.490
- Chihiro, that's your name?
- Yes.

40:10.783 --> 40:13.451
Quite a fancy name.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.672
From now on, your name is Sen.

40:26.132 --> 40:27.966
Understand? Sen.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.677
Answer me, Sen!

40:30.970 --> 40:32.262
I understand.

40:32.430 --> 40:33.638
Yes ma'am?

40:36.809 --> 40:41.062
- See to her, she's starting work today.
- Very well.

40:41.814 --> 40:42.939
What is your name?

40:43.983 --> 40:46.693
Chi... I mean, Sen.

40:46.986 --> 40:49.154
Then follow me, Sen.

40:57.663 --> 40:58.997
Haku, I...

40:59.331 --> 41:00.999
No idle chatter.

41:01.125 --> 41:03.460
Call me Master Haku.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.353
I'm afraid even Yubaba
can't give an order like that.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.147
Humans aren't allowed here.

41:24.648 --> 41:26.191
She signed the contract.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.526
- What!
- I'll work hard.

41:28.819 --> 41:32.280
- Don't send her to us.
- She stinks to high heaven.

41:33.032 --> 41:35.867
She won't stink
after three days of our food.

41:35.993 --> 41:40.205
If she doesn't measure up,
do with her as you will.

41:42.041 --> 41:44.292
Now go back to work.
Where's Lin?

41:44.418 --> 41:46.794
What, you're dumping her on me?

41:47.087 --> 41:48.546
You wanted an assistant.

41:48.714 --> 41:51.633
That's right! Lin's just perfect.

41:52.051 --> 41:53.134
Go, Sen.

41:53.260 --> 41:54.260
Yes sir.

41:55.054 --> 41:58.389
What a pain.
You're gonna pay for this.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.517
Off you go.

42:02.895 --> 42:04.187
Come on.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.531
You pulled it off!

42:15.157 --> 42:17.283
You're so thick, I was worried.

42:17.701 --> 42:21.371
Keep your wits about you.
If you need anything, ask me.

42:23.249 --> 42:24.791
What's wrong?

42:25.751 --> 42:27.794
My legs are shaking.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.384
This is where we live.

42:35.386 --> 42:37.762
Eat, sleep and you'll be fine.

42:40.766 --> 42:42.642
Your apron.
Keep it clean.

42:42.935 --> 42:44.018
Trousers.

42:44.728 --> 42:46.896
You're so puny.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.065
Too big.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.694
Lin, are there...

42:52.820 --> 42:53.778
What?

42:53.946 --> 42:56.030
Are there two Hakus here?

42:56.198 --> 42:59.701
Two of that one?
I sure hope not.

43:00.286 --> 43:01.286
Still too big.

43:01.412 --> 43:04.163
He's Yubaba's apprentice.
Be careful around him.

43:07.585 --> 43:09.752
Now where was that...

43:10.462 --> 43:12.630
All right, here we go.

43:13.966 --> 43:18.094
Hey, are you okay?
Don't fall apart on me.

43:18.971 --> 43:21.306
What's all the noise, Lin?

43:21.432 --> 43:23.850
New girl.
Says she feels faint.

44:55.859 --> 45:00.113
Meet me at the bridge.
I'll take you to your mother and father.

45:44.450 --> 45:45.491
My shoes are gone.

45:59.798 --> 46:01.424
Thank you.

47:09.868 --> 47:11.327
Follow me.

47:54.371 --> 47:56.956
Dad, Mom, it's me!

47:57.499 --> 47:58.791
It's Sen.

47:59.501 --> 48:01.878
Mom! Dad!

48:05.007 --> 48:06.924
Are they sick? Are they hurt?

48:07.092 --> 48:09.802
They're just sleeping.
Their stomachs are full.

48:10.554 --> 48:13.472
They don't remember
they were ever human.

48:19.104 --> 48:21.522
Listen to me!
I promise I'll save you.

48:21.648 --> 48:24.817
Don't get too fat
or they'll eat you.

48:33.118 --> 48:34.702
Hide these.

48:37.623 --> 48:38.956
I thought they were gone.

48:39.458 --> 48:41.292
For when you go home.

48:47.424 --> 48:49.759
This was a farewell card.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.678
Chihiro?

48:53.096 --> 48:56.182
Chihiro...
That's my name!

48:57.225 --> 48:59.685
Yubaba controls us
by stealing our names.

49:00.437 --> 49:04.523
You're Sen here.
Keep your real name a secret.

49:04.816 --> 49:07.944
She almost got my name.
I was turning into Sen.

49:08.820 --> 49:12.031
Without your real name,
you'll never find your way home.

49:12.991 --> 49:15.451
I no longer remember mine.

49:15.661 --> 49:17.453
Your real name?

49:17.663 --> 49:20.998
But it's strange,
I remember yours.

49:23.460 --> 49:26.045
Better eat, you must be hungry.

49:26.338 --> 49:27.713
I don't want to.

49:28.006 --> 49:32.093
I put a spell on them
to give you back your strength.

50:08.547 --> 50:11.173
You've had a rough time.
Better eat more.

50:26.064 --> 50:27.356
You know the way back.

50:27.482 --> 50:30.151
Thanks Haku.
I promise to work hard.

52:05.122 --> 52:07.581
Where were you? I was worried.

52:07.707 --> 52:08.916
Sorry.

52:18.218 --> 52:20.052
Out of the way.

52:32.899 --> 52:35.151
Come on,
give it some elbow grease.

52:35.652 --> 52:38.237
Starting today, you two
are on the big tub.

52:38.530 --> 52:40.531
What? That's Frog work!

52:40.657 --> 52:43.742
Orders from the top.
And no shirking, either.

53:03.847 --> 53:05.764
Aren't you getting wet?

53:09.895 --> 53:11.478
Sen, come on!

53:11.605 --> 53:12.897
Coming!

53:13.064 --> 53:14.773
I'll leave this open.

53:42.719 --> 53:44.678
- On the big tub, Lin?
- Stuff it.

53:48.308 --> 53:51.477
Just look at this.
Hasn't been scrubbed in ages.

54:05.992 --> 54:09.161
The big tub is reserved
for our filthiest guests.

54:09.329 --> 54:10.996
It's caked with sludge.

54:11.289 --> 54:13.749
Lin! Sen!
First customers are coming.

54:13.959 --> 54:15.542
All right already!

54:15.669 --> 54:17.878
Man, this is pure harassment.

54:18.004 --> 54:21.131
Go get a tag
from the foreman.

54:21.258 --> 54:22.341
A tag?

54:25.136 --> 54:27.012
For an herbal bath.

54:27.264 --> 54:28.514
Right.

54:29.641 --> 54:31.267
Lin, what's a foreman?

54:35.522 --> 54:38.315
Something's coming.
I wonder...

54:47.325 --> 54:51.161
Is some good-for-nothing
using the rain to sneak in?

55:15.437 --> 55:17.938
Absolutely not,
it's too valuable to waste.

55:18.189 --> 55:19.857
Good morning!

55:20.317 --> 55:22.276
Feeling refreshed?

55:22.694 --> 55:23.861
For Kasuga.

55:23.987 --> 55:26.155
One deluxe sulfur bath.

55:26.531 --> 55:28.991
No point standing there.
Back to work.

55:29.367 --> 55:30.868
Scrub it with your hands.

55:31.036 --> 55:32.745
Good morning!

55:33.038 --> 55:33.996
Your bare hands.

55:34.122 --> 55:37.374
But she said
it has to be an herbal bath.

55:37.500 --> 55:39.126
You just don't get it.

55:39.252 --> 55:41.211
Mugwort, right?

55:41.546 --> 55:43.505
Relax and enjoy.

55:52.557 --> 55:55.225
Foreman.
Yes ma'am!

55:57.312 --> 55:58.354
Thank you!

55:58.480 --> 55:59.605
But that's not...

55:59.814 --> 56:01.231
Hey you, wait!

56:01.399 --> 56:02.232
What's the trouble?

56:02.400 --> 56:03.817
Oh, nothing at all.

56:04.194 --> 56:05.736
We have an intruder.

56:05.904 --> 56:06.695
A human?

56:06.821 --> 56:09.823
You figure it out.
Haku's gone today.

56:10.033 --> 56:12.409
Wow, you got a really good one.

56:12.535 --> 56:15.079
This goes straight to Kamaji.

56:16.664 --> 56:18.499
Water should be right up.

56:24.547 --> 56:27.466
Yank this for hot water.
Go ahead, try it.

56:36.142 --> 56:38.477
You're really are a klutz.

56:38.645 --> 56:40.729
Look at that color.

56:40.855 --> 56:43.148
This one has dried worm salts.

56:43.733 --> 56:46.652
With water this murky,
who's gonna see the sludge?

56:48.780 --> 56:51.615
Yank it again
when it's full. It'll stop.

56:52.075 --> 56:55.411
You can let go now.
I'll go get our breakfast.

56:55.537 --> 56:56.787
Okay.

57:19.102 --> 57:21.228
Ouch!

57:25.275 --> 57:27.943
Um...
The bath's not ready yet.

57:33.491 --> 57:34.950
So many...

57:37.662 --> 57:39.580
They're for me?

57:42.709 --> 57:45.210
But I don't need them.

57:47.964 --> 57:49.715
No, you gave me one already.

58:04.647 --> 58:05.606
Madam!

58:05.732 --> 58:09.276
- It's a Stink Spirit.
- Yes, and a large one, too.

58:09.402 --> 58:11.153
It's headed straight for the bridge!

58:11.279 --> 58:13.655
Please turn back.

58:14.365 --> 58:17.659
Please go!
The baths are closed for the night.

58:17.911 --> 58:20.370
Please withdraw, please!

58:20.538 --> 58:23.165
Stinky!

58:23.374 --> 58:27.252
That's odd.
Stink Spirits feel different.

58:27.378 --> 58:29.922
Well, now that it's here,
better go greet it!

58:30.632 --> 58:34.176
All we can do
is get rid of it fast.

58:34.761 --> 58:36.553
Everyone, please return to your rooms!

58:36.721 --> 58:38.430
Please hurry.
Terribly sorry!

58:40.391 --> 58:42.518
Lin and Sen, Yubaba wants you.

58:42.644 --> 58:43.435
Yes sir!

58:43.686 --> 58:46.271
Pay attention, this is your debut.

58:46.397 --> 58:49.191
Show the customer to the big tub.

58:50.193 --> 58:52.194
Remember, one peep
out of you and you're coal.

58:52.445 --> 58:55.364
- Got it?
- It has arrived.

59:05.667 --> 59:07.751
No, that's not polite!

59:15.802 --> 59:19.263
Welgum to our bazz.

59:22.642 --> 59:24.601
Oh...
Money...!

59:24.769 --> 59:27.312
Hurry Sen, take it!

59:27.438 --> 59:28.689
Yez ma'am.

59:36.990 --> 59:41.577
Wud are you wading for?
Show him to da bazz!

59:41.703 --> 59:43.453
Diz way...

1:00:01.973 --> 1:00:03.640
Sen!

1:00:07.937 --> 1:00:10.439
Horrible!

1:00:11.524 --> 1:00:12.482
Breakfast!

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:14.693
Open the windows, all of 'em!

1:00:57.904 --> 1:01:00.572
What? Just a minute.

1:01:06.204 --> 1:01:08.955
- That's really filthy.
- It's not funny.

1:01:09.082 --> 1:01:10.666
What will she do?

1:01:15.254 --> 1:01:17.631
Ah, she's going to refill the tub.

1:01:17.799 --> 1:01:21.718
Oh dear, she's soiling the walls
with her dirty hands!

1:01:33.898 --> 1:01:35.732
Did you give Sen new tags?

1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:38.527
Never, what a waste!

1:02:19.819 --> 1:02:22.446
All that precious herbal essence!

1:02:48.514 --> 1:02:50.766
Sen! Sen, where are you?

1:02:50.892 --> 1:02:53.143
- Lin!
- Are you okay?

1:02:53.269 --> 1:02:55.937
I asked Kamaji to help us out.

1:02:56.481 --> 1:02:58.565
He's sending his
best herbal essence.

1:02:58.983 --> 1:03:02.194
Thanks. There's a thorn
or something stuck in him.

1:03:02.320 --> 1:03:03.320
A thorn?

1:03:03.446 --> 1:03:05.071
I can't pull it out.

1:03:05.323 --> 1:03:07.908
A thorn? Hmm...

1:03:09.368 --> 1:03:11.036
Get everyone downstairs!

1:03:11.162 --> 1:03:11.953
Hurry!

1:03:15.541 --> 1:03:17.000
Sen and Lin!

1:03:17.210 --> 1:03:19.586
Our guest is no Stink Spirit.

1:03:21.714 --> 1:03:23.256
Use this rope.

1:03:23.382 --> 1:03:24.466
Yes ma'am!

1:03:33.226 --> 1:03:34.726
Tie it good and tight!

1:03:36.312 --> 1:03:39.940
Hurry up!
Girls, lend a hand!

1:03:40.274 --> 1:03:41.942
It's tied!

1:03:43.152 --> 1:03:46.530
Everyone ready? All together now!

1:03:46.656 --> 1:03:49.449
Heave!

1:03:50.076 --> 1:03:51.952
And heave!

1:03:52.203 --> 1:03:56.706
Heave!

1:04:04.549 --> 1:04:05.465
A bicycle?

1:04:06.092 --> 1:04:09.469
I knew it.
Now, heave!

1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:12.222
Heave!

1:04:43.796 --> 1:04:46.423
Sen, are you all right?

1:04:56.601 --> 1:04:59.394
Well done.

1:05:28.799 --> 1:05:30.967
Gold! It's gold!

1:05:31.135 --> 1:05:33.720
Hands off! That's company property.

1:05:33.846 --> 1:05:37.307
Quiet! Our guest is still with us.

1:05:43.189 --> 1:05:46.149
Sen, you're in the way.
Get down from there.

1:05:46.317 --> 1:05:48.818
Open the main gates!
He's leaving!

1:06:15.554 --> 1:06:19.683
Sen, you're a wonder!
You made us a fortune.

1:06:20.393 --> 1:06:22.978
That was the guardian
of a great river.

1:06:23.104 --> 1:06:24.771
Everyone, learn from Sen!

1:06:25.356 --> 1:06:27.357
Sake on the house tonight.

1:06:27.858 --> 1:06:30.527
Now hand over all
that gold you picked up.

1:06:44.166 --> 1:06:46.167
Want some? I swiped them.

1:06:46.669 --> 1:06:48.044
Thanks.

1:06:48.212 --> 1:06:50.380
What a day.

1:06:52.883 --> 1:06:54.300
Haku missed the whole thing.

1:06:54.427 --> 1:06:56.302
Not Haku again!

1:06:57.221 --> 1:06:59.597
Sometimes he just disappears.

1:07:00.057 --> 1:07:03.810
They say Yubaba makes
him do bad stuff.

1:07:03.936 --> 1:07:04.728
Really?

1:07:04.895 --> 1:07:06.271
Lights out, Lin.

1:07:06.397 --> 1:07:07.439
Okay.

1:07:32.631 --> 1:07:35.300
There's a town.
And the water's like an ocean.

1:07:35.468 --> 1:07:38.470
What did you expect
after all that rain?

1:07:40.306 --> 1:07:44.309
I'm gonna get there someday.
I'll get out of here for sure.

1:08:08.793 --> 1:08:10.126
What's wrong?

1:08:39.698 --> 1:08:41.199
Gold!

1:08:44.036 --> 1:08:47.038
Who are you? You're no customer.

1:08:47.164 --> 1:08:48.915
You're not allowed in there.

1:08:55.339 --> 1:08:58.716
Hey, it's gold! For me?

1:09:04.014 --> 1:09:06.349
You can make gold?

1:09:11.897 --> 1:09:12.856
Gimme!

1:09:21.073 --> 1:09:22.782
Who's down here?

1:09:23.826 --> 1:09:26.202
It's way past lights out.

1:09:29.748 --> 1:09:33.042
Hey boss, I'm hungry.

1:09:33.169 --> 1:09:34.210
Starved, in fact.

1:09:34.378 --> 1:09:35.253
That voice...

1:09:35.379 --> 1:09:37.297
There, I'll pay you now.

1:09:38.048 --> 1:09:40.675
I'm a customer.
I want a bath.

1:09:40.801 --> 1:09:42.427
Wake everyone up!

1:09:47.933 --> 1:09:51.227
Mom and Dad, the river guardian
gave me this medicine.

1:09:51.395 --> 1:09:54.272
If you take it,
you'll be people again.

1:09:58.402 --> 1:10:00.403
Dad, Mom, where are you?

1:10:00.779 --> 1:10:02.030
Daddy!

1:10:13.125 --> 1:10:14.292
What an awful dream.

1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:17.086
Lin?

1:10:21.258 --> 1:10:22.800
Where is everybody?

1:10:29.308 --> 1:10:32.101
Wow, it really did
turn into an ocean!

1:10:37.358 --> 1:10:40.360
I can see where Mom and
Dad are from here.

1:10:44.073 --> 1:10:46.032
Kamaji lit the fires already.

1:10:46.158 --> 1:10:48.076
Did I sleep that long?

1:10:51.747 --> 1:10:54.749
The customer's waiting.
Can't you work faster?

1:10:54.875 --> 1:10:58.878
Serve everything you've got,
even leftovers!

1:11:00.839 --> 1:11:01.756
Sen!

1:11:01.882 --> 1:11:02.882
Lin?

1:11:03.092 --> 1:11:05.843
I was just coming
to wake you up, look!

1:11:06.095 --> 1:11:08.346
Gold! He gave me real gold.

1:11:08.681 --> 1:11:10.723
We've got a real high roller.

1:11:10.849 --> 1:11:13.226
Please, sir, try this!

1:11:17.356 --> 1:11:19.983
Throw us some gold!

1:11:21.986 --> 1:11:25.321
I'm starving, bring it all!

1:11:29.994 --> 1:11:31.244
Who's this guest?

1:11:31.537 --> 1:11:34.914
Come on, Yubaba's still asleep.
Now's your chance.

1:11:35.374 --> 1:11:37.250
I'm going to see Kamaji.

1:11:37.876 --> 1:11:40.003
I wouldn't go there now.

1:11:40.129 --> 1:11:42.338
He's angry because they woke him up.

1:11:42.506 --> 1:11:44.340
Lin, let's go back for more.

1:12:09.533 --> 1:12:12.869
What if I can't recognize my parents?

1:12:13.704 --> 1:12:16.456
I hope Dad hasn't gotten too fat.

1:12:44.735 --> 1:12:46.235
That's the dragon I saw.

1:12:46.737 --> 1:12:48.237
It's coming this way.

1:12:50.949 --> 1:12:52.283
Those aren't birds!

1:13:03.670 --> 1:13:06.798
Haku, don't give up.
Over here!

1:13:08.384 --> 1:13:09.467
Haku!

1:13:28.862 --> 1:13:30.029
It's just paper.

1:13:58.308 --> 1:14:00.476
Haku? It is you, isn't it?

1:14:06.650 --> 1:14:09.944
Are you hurt?
Those paper birds are gone.

1:14:10.070 --> 1:14:11.362
You're safe now.

1:14:24.543 --> 1:14:26.294
He's going to Yubaba.

1:14:26.879 --> 1:14:29.338
What should I do? He'll die!

1:14:37.014 --> 1:14:41.559
Now the richest man
in the whole wide world...

1:14:41.894 --> 1:14:45.938
has come to grace us
with his presence.

1:14:46.982 --> 1:14:48.900
Greetings!

1:14:49.026 --> 1:14:52.361
Now let us appeal
to his generosity.

1:14:52.654 --> 1:14:54.697
Please, sir! Over here.

1:14:58.160 --> 1:14:59.327
I hope I get some.

1:14:59.453 --> 1:15:01.454
They say gold
springs from his palms.

1:15:02.331 --> 1:15:05.374
Toss some this way, sir!

1:15:09.379 --> 1:15:10.755
What are you doing?

1:15:10.881 --> 1:15:11.839
Going upstairs.

1:15:11.965 --> 1:15:14.008
No you don't.
What's this?

1:15:14.718 --> 1:15:15.968
Blood!

1:15:19.890 --> 1:15:22.141
Out of the way,
we have a guest.

1:15:23.727 --> 1:15:25.520
Thank you for your help.

1:15:25.896 --> 1:15:28.314
Get out of the way!

1:15:50.254 --> 1:15:51.921
I don't need it.

1:15:54.841 --> 1:15:57.176
I'm busy, please excuse me.

1:16:08.814 --> 1:16:11.691
Quiet! Quiet down.

1:16:12.359 --> 1:16:14.026
Back, get back!

1:16:14.444 --> 1:16:16.571
Please excuse her manners.

1:16:16.697 --> 1:16:20.241
The girl is new and a human.

1:16:22.786 --> 1:16:25.371
What's so funny?
Wipe off that smile.

1:16:25.622 --> 1:16:26.956
Why, I would never...

1:16:31.878 --> 1:16:34.255
He ate them!

1:18:01.176 --> 1:18:02.426
Yubaba!

1:19:15.041 --> 1:19:17.918
We're in a fine mess now.

1:19:18.545 --> 1:19:20.629
He's a No Face.

1:19:20.797 --> 1:19:22.757
That's right, a No Face!

1:19:23.049 --> 1:19:25.968
Your greed attracted quite a guest.

1:19:26.470 --> 1:19:29.722
Don't do anything stupid
until I get down there.

1:19:30.307 --> 1:19:32.683
Just look at this carpet.

1:19:32.809 --> 1:19:35.060
Get Haku out of here.

1:19:35.187 --> 1:19:37.062
He's useless to me now.

1:19:59.544 --> 1:20:02.630
Bo, sleeping outside
your crib again?

1:20:06.551 --> 1:20:10.679
Oh I'm sorry, you were
sleeping like such a good baby.

1:20:10.847 --> 1:20:13.766
Baba still has work to do.

1:20:16.686 --> 1:20:19.480
Go back to sleep now,
that's a good baby.

1:20:47.509 --> 1:20:49.426
Ouch, let me go!

1:20:49.886 --> 1:20:51.720
Oh, thanks for helping me.

1:20:51.847 --> 1:20:55.140
But I'm in a hurry,
please let me go.

1:20:55.267 --> 1:20:57.601
You came to make me sick.

1:20:58.144 --> 1:21:00.729
The outside has bad germs.

1:21:01.606 --> 1:21:05.484
I'm a human.
Maybe you never saw one before.

1:21:05.735 --> 1:21:08.028
You'll get sick out there.

1:21:08.154 --> 1:21:10.239
Stay here and play with me.

1:21:10.407 --> 1:21:11.949
Are you sick?

1:21:12.075 --> 1:21:14.910
I'm in here 'cause
I'll get sick outside.

1:21:15.036 --> 1:21:17.496
Staying inside will make you sick!

1:21:17.622 --> 1:21:21.375
You see, someone I really
care about is badly hurt.

1:21:21.501 --> 1:21:23.127
I've got to go right now.

1:21:23.253 --> 1:21:24.628
Please let me go.

1:21:24.838 --> 1:21:29.967
If you go, I'll start crying.
Then Baba will come and kill you.

1:21:30.135 --> 1:21:31.844
I'll break your little arm.

1:21:31.970 --> 1:21:33.095
You're hurting me!

1:21:33.263 --> 1:21:35.764
Please, I'll come play with you later.

1:21:35.932 --> 1:21:37.516
No, I wanna play now!

1:21:41.521 --> 1:21:43.689
Blood! See? It's blood!

1:21:55.285 --> 1:21:56.785
Haku!

1:21:57.120 --> 1:21:59.204
Go away!

1:21:59.331 --> 1:22:00.414
It's you, isn't it?

1:22:00.624 --> 1:22:01.957
Hang on!

1:22:02.417 --> 1:22:03.375
Be quiet!

1:22:03.501 --> 1:22:04.627
Haku!

1:22:10.425 --> 1:22:11.383
Go away!

1:22:14.054 --> 1:22:15.387
No!

1:22:30.487 --> 1:22:34.239
I'm not afraid of blood.
I'll cry if you don't play.

1:22:34.407 --> 1:22:36.241
Please be a good boy and wait.

1:22:36.868 --> 1:22:39.662
If you don't play
with me I'll cry...

1:22:41.665 --> 1:22:43.040
Please, wait!

1:22:43.166 --> 1:22:46.460
What a racket.
Simmer down.

1:22:47.754 --> 1:22:50.172
You're a little butterball, aren't you?

1:22:58.014 --> 1:23:00.224
I am a bit transparent here.

1:23:00.350 --> 1:23:01.183
Baba...

1:23:01.851 --> 1:23:05.771
Oh dear, can't you even tell
me from your own mother?

1:23:14.114 --> 1:23:16.865
There, that gives you
a little more freedom.

1:23:16.992 --> 1:23:20.285
Let's see now.
What shall we turn you into?

1:23:38.304 --> 1:23:41.015
This is our little secret.
If you tell anyone...

1:23:41.141 --> 1:23:43.183
I'll do the same to you.

1:23:44.728 --> 1:23:45.894
Who are you?

1:23:46.062 --> 1:23:48.439
Yubaba's older twin sister.

1:23:48.565 --> 1:23:52.359
Thanks to you I've had
a nice tour of the place.

1:23:52.485 --> 1:23:54.445
Now hand over the dragon.

1:23:54.696 --> 1:23:57.072
What are you going to do?
He needs help.

1:23:57.407 --> 1:24:00.534
That dragon's a thief.
He works for my sister.

1:24:00.702 --> 1:24:03.704
He stole a valuable seal from my house.

1:24:03.830 --> 1:24:06.582
Haku would never do that.
He's too kind.

1:24:07.083 --> 1:24:10.627
All dragons are kind.
Kind and stupid...

1:24:10.754 --> 1:24:15.340
and eager to learn
my sister's magical ways.

1:24:15.759 --> 1:24:19.344
This boy will do anything
that greedy woman wants.

1:24:19.596 --> 1:24:21.680
Now step aside.

1:24:21.806 --> 1:24:24.266
It's too late for him anyway.

1:24:24.434 --> 1:24:27.561
The thing he stole
had a protection spell.

1:24:27.687 --> 1:24:29.813
Now the thief will die.

1:24:30.607 --> 1:24:32.274
No, don't!

1:24:39.783 --> 1:24:41.784
What are you up to now?

1:24:41.910 --> 1:24:44.578
All right, that's enough.
Back to your room.

1:24:52.253 --> 1:24:54.296
Oh dear, that was careless...

1:24:54.839 --> 1:24:56.173
Haku, no!

1:25:17.570 --> 1:25:18.779
Haku!

1:25:46.766 --> 1:25:48.392
What is this?

1:25:48.518 --> 1:25:49.977
Hold on there!

1:25:52.939 --> 1:25:54.231
Haku!

1:25:57.694 --> 1:25:59.278
Does it hurt?

1:26:02.907 --> 1:26:05.033
This is serious.

1:26:07.120 --> 1:26:08.287
Haku, don't give up.

1:26:08.413 --> 1:26:10.205
What can we do? He'll die!

1:26:10.707 --> 1:26:13.417
Something inside him
is eating him up.

1:26:13.543 --> 1:26:14.626
Inside him?

1:26:14.752 --> 1:26:18.088
It's a strong spell.
There's nothing I can do.

1:26:18.381 --> 1:26:21.675
Haku, the river guardian gave me this.

1:26:21.801 --> 1:26:23.969
Eat it, maybe it will help.

1:26:26.222 --> 1:26:28.473
Haku, open your mouth.

1:26:28.725 --> 1:26:31.310
Please Haku, eat it.

1:26:33.062 --> 1:26:34.855
See, it's safe.

1:26:35.148 --> 1:26:37.232
Is it some kind of medicine?

1:26:37.483 --> 1:26:40.527
Open your mouth.
You can do it.

1:26:44.324 --> 1:26:46.074
That's it.

1:26:46.201 --> 1:26:47.618
Swallow it.

1:27:06.012 --> 1:27:07.387
He spit something out.
That's it!

1:27:20.109 --> 1:27:21.318
The seal!

1:27:21.486 --> 1:27:23.320
It's getting away.
There! Over there!

1:27:43.049 --> 1:27:45.717
Sen, we have to purge the spell.

1:27:49.889 --> 1:27:50.806
Begone!

1:27:50.932 --> 1:27:53.725
Haku took this from Yubaba's sister.

1:27:54.060 --> 1:27:56.728
From Zeniba? That's a witch's seal.

1:27:57.146 --> 1:27:59.273
Precious loot, I'd say.

1:28:02.777 --> 1:28:03.777
I knew it was Haku.

1:28:03.903 --> 1:28:05.487
Kamaji, it's Haku!

1:28:07.699 --> 1:28:08.657
Haku!

1:28:08.825 --> 1:28:10.325
Haku, Haku!

1:28:12.662 --> 1:28:14.621
Kamaji, he's not breathing.

1:28:14.747 --> 1:28:18.333
He is, but he's still
very ill from the spell.

1:28:27.593 --> 1:28:30.595
That should calm him some.

1:28:33.016 --> 1:28:37.894
Haku turned up one day,
just like you.

1:28:38.021 --> 1:28:40.856
He said he wanted to learn magic.

1:28:41.149 --> 1:28:43.150
I tried to warn him.

1:28:43.276 --> 1:28:46.945
Becoming a sorcerer's apprentice
is dangerous business.

1:28:47.447 --> 1:28:49.865
But he wouldn't listen.
He kept saying...

1:28:50.116 --> 1:28:51.742
that he'd lost his home.

1:28:51.868 --> 1:28:55.412
So he signed up to be
Yubaba's apprentice.

1:28:55.872 --> 1:28:58.999
He got paler and paler
as time went by...

1:28:59.125 --> 1:29:02.044
and got a sharp
gleam in his eye.

1:29:04.088 --> 1:29:08.091
Kamaji, I'm going to give
this back to Zeniba.

1:29:08.217 --> 1:29:11.928
Give it back, apologize,
and ask her to help Haku.

1:29:12.055 --> 1:29:13.972
Tell me how to get there.

1:29:14.390 --> 1:29:16.725
To Zeniba's house?

1:29:17.143 --> 1:29:19.061
That's one scary sorceress.

1:29:19.187 --> 1:29:19.978
Please.

1:29:20.229 --> 1:29:24.232
Haku helped me.
Now I want to help him.

1:29:25.943 --> 1:29:29.071
Well, getting there is one thing.

1:29:29.238 --> 1:29:31.156
Getting back's the problem.

1:29:31.491 --> 1:29:33.241
Wait a minute.

1:29:35.661 --> 1:29:38.997
Let's see now,
they're here somewhere...

1:29:39.665 --> 1:29:42.751
Everyone, I need
my shoes and clothes.

1:29:51.094 --> 1:29:54.096
Sen! I've been hunting
for you everywhere!

1:29:56.641 --> 1:29:57.766
Lin...

1:29:57.892 --> 1:30:00.560
Haku? What happened here?

1:30:01.270 --> 1:30:02.270
Who are those guys?

1:30:03.356 --> 1:30:04.815
My new friends.

1:30:04.941 --> 1:30:05.649
Right?

1:30:05.900 --> 1:30:09.069
Yubaba's looking for you.
She's hopping mad.

1:30:09.278 --> 1:30:12.906
That big tipper turned out
to be a No Face.

1:30:13.366 --> 1:30:15.784
Yubaba says you let him in.

1:30:19.205 --> 1:30:20.455
She might be right.

1:30:20.581 --> 1:30:22.624
What, are you serious?

1:30:22.792 --> 1:30:24.418
I thought he was a customer.

1:30:24.544 --> 1:30:27.712
He's already swallowed
three of our people!

1:30:28.131 --> 1:30:31.133
Found them.
Here they are, Sen.

1:30:31.551 --> 1:30:33.176
We're busy, gramps.

1:30:33.302 --> 1:30:34.886
You can use these.

1:30:36.305 --> 1:30:39.099
Train tickets?
Where'd you get those?

1:30:39.225 --> 1:30:41.685
Leftovers from 40 years ago.

1:30:41.811 --> 1:30:45.564
You get off at the sixth stop,
called Swamp Bottom.

1:30:45.815 --> 1:30:46.898
Swamp Bottom?

1:30:47.024 --> 1:30:48.942
That's right, the sixth stop.

1:30:49.068 --> 1:30:50.068
Six.

1:30:50.445 --> 1:30:54.030
Make sure you get it right.
There used to be a return train...

1:30:54.157 --> 1:30:55.991
but these days it's one way only.

1:30:56.159 --> 1:30:57.826
Still want to go?

1:30:57.952 --> 1:31:01.163
Yes, I'll walk back along the tracks.

1:31:02.874 --> 1:31:04.624
What about Yubaba?

1:31:04.750 --> 1:31:06.001
I'll talk to her now.

1:31:06.836 --> 1:31:10.630
Haku, I promise I'll be back.
Please don't die.

1:31:11.257 --> 1:31:12.924
What's going on here?

1:31:13.509 --> 1:31:15.969
Don't you understand? It's love.

1:31:23.853 --> 1:31:26.188
It just keeps getting bigger!

1:31:26.355 --> 1:31:28.982
- Don't let it eat me!
- Here she comes.

1:31:36.532 --> 1:31:37.991
Thank goodness, Sen!

1:31:38.117 --> 1:31:40.327
Yubaba can't control him.

1:31:43.539 --> 1:31:47.375
There's no need to get upset.
Sen will be here soon.

1:31:47.793 --> 1:31:50.295
Where's Sen? I want Sen!

1:31:50.630 --> 1:31:52.255
Now hurry!

1:31:57.595 --> 1:31:59.513
Yubaba, it's Sen.

1:31:59.639 --> 1:32:01.014
Where were you?

1:32:01.140 --> 1:32:05.560
Sen is here, honored guest.
She'll be right with you.

1:32:06.604 --> 1:32:09.731
What took you so long?
This is a total disaster!

1:32:09.899 --> 1:32:12.734
Win him over
and take all his gold.

1:32:16.614 --> 1:32:18.949
What's this filthy rat?

1:32:20.785 --> 1:32:23.161
Don't you recognize him?

1:32:23.412 --> 1:32:26.164
Of course not.
How disgusting.

1:32:26.374 --> 1:32:27.749
Now in you go.

1:32:29.252 --> 1:32:31.503
Have a nice time.

1:32:32.421 --> 1:32:34.673
Will she be all right?

1:32:34.924 --> 1:32:36.758
Want to take her place?

1:32:57.280 --> 1:33:00.448
Try this, it's yummy.

1:33:02.326 --> 1:33:06.830
Want some gold?
I've decided it's just for you.

1:33:10.835 --> 1:33:12.586
Come over here.

1:33:12.712 --> 1:33:16.339
What do you want?
You can tell me.

1:33:16.674 --> 1:33:18.592
Where did you come from?

1:33:18.718 --> 1:33:21.094
There's someplace
I have to go right away.

1:33:23.472 --> 1:33:25.932
You should go home.

1:33:26.142 --> 1:33:29.102
You can't give me what I want.

1:33:30.980 --> 1:33:33.982
Where's your home?
You must have a mom and dad.

1:33:34.817 --> 1:33:38.111
No... No...

1:33:39.071 --> 1:33:42.824
I'm lonely... So lonely...

1:33:43.659 --> 1:33:45.160
Are you lost?

1:33:45.536 --> 1:33:49.080
Sen... I want Sen.

1:33:49.707 --> 1:33:50.832
Take the gold.

1:33:51.375 --> 1:33:52.500
Would you eat me?

1:33:52.668 --> 1:33:53.460
Take it.

1:33:53.586 --> 1:33:54.461
Take it!

1:34:03.721 --> 1:34:06.431
Before you eat me, eat this first.

1:34:07.224 --> 1:34:11.061
I was saving it for my parents,
but you can have it.

1:34:31.874 --> 1:34:33.291
Sen!

1:34:35.753 --> 1:34:39.506
You little wench!
What did you feed me?

1:34:54.772 --> 1:34:56.106
Watch out!

1:34:57.274 --> 1:34:59.109
Not in my house!

1:35:12.540 --> 1:35:13.957
I'm over here!

1:35:14.750 --> 1:35:16.084
Here!

1:36:00.838 --> 1:36:02.505
You'll pay for this!

1:36:19.982 --> 1:36:22.025
Sen, down here!

1:36:38.375 --> 1:36:40.627
Over here!

1:36:40.753 --> 1:36:42.420
We don't need him.

1:36:46.425 --> 1:36:49.928
He needs to get out of there.
It's bad for him.

1:36:50.054 --> 1:36:52.180
But where do we take him?

1:36:52.348 --> 1:36:53.306
I don't know.

1:36:53.432 --> 1:36:54.849
Don't know?

1:36:55.309 --> 1:36:57.936
Great, now he's following us.

1:37:15.454 --> 1:37:17.539
- From here you walk.
- Okay.

1:37:17.665 --> 1:37:19.374
You'll find the station.

1:37:19.542 --> 1:37:20.959
Thanks.

1:37:21.585 --> 1:37:23.211
Be sure to come back!

1:37:23.420 --> 1:37:24.420
I will.

1:37:28.592 --> 1:37:32.053
Sen! I said you were a klutz.

1:37:32.221 --> 1:37:33.721
I take it back!

1:37:41.939 --> 1:37:46.109
No Face, hurt her
and you'll get it from me!

1:37:49.405 --> 1:37:50.738
There it is.

1:38:02.293 --> 1:38:04.669
The train's coming, let's hurry.

1:38:28.152 --> 1:38:30.403
To Swamp Bottom, please.

1:38:36.994 --> 1:38:38.661
You want to come too?

1:38:40.164 --> 1:38:42.165
One more, please.

1:39:22.706 --> 1:39:24.040
Sit down.

1:39:24.667 --> 1:39:26.334
Behave yourself, okay?

1:41:28.499 --> 1:41:29.957
Kamaji.

1:41:32.336 --> 1:41:34.921
Oh, Haku.
You're awake.

1:41:35.047 --> 1:41:36.589
Kamaji, where's Sen?

1:41:37.007 --> 1:41:39.592
What happened? Please tell me.

1:41:39.843 --> 1:41:42.720
Don't you remember anything?

1:41:43.305 --> 1:41:45.389
Just fragments.

1:41:45.599 --> 1:41:48.684
Chihiro kept calling my name
in the darkness.

1:41:48.977 --> 1:41:52.980
I followed her voice
and woke up here.

1:41:53.357 --> 1:41:58.236
Chihiro?
So her name is Chihiro.

1:41:59.488 --> 1:42:02.365
Wonderful... It's the power of love.

1:42:06.036 --> 1:42:09.122
This gold will hardly cover the damage.

1:42:09.248 --> 1:42:12.166
That fool, Sen!
She just cost me a fortune.

1:42:12.668 --> 1:42:16.337
But we were saved, thanks to her.

1:42:16.505 --> 1:42:17.630
Silence!

1:42:17.756 --> 1:42:20.174
She started the whole thing.

1:42:20.300 --> 1:42:22.593
Now she's run away.

1:42:22.719 --> 1:42:25.388
Abandoned her own parents!

1:42:26.056 --> 1:42:29.892
They must be fat enough.
Turn them into bacon or ham.

1:42:30.227 --> 1:42:31.853
No, wait.

1:42:33.021 --> 1:42:34.147
Master Haku!

1:42:34.273 --> 1:42:36.524
What, you're still alive?

1:42:38.902 --> 1:42:42.280
You still don't see it?
She's played a trick on you.

1:42:42.739 --> 1:42:45.533
You've gotten pretty fresh.

1:42:45.701 --> 1:42:48.161
Since when do you talk that way?

1:43:39.796 --> 1:43:41.756
Bo?

1:43:47.763 --> 1:43:49.388
Bo!

1:43:49.514 --> 1:43:50.514
Pebbles!

1:43:50.641 --> 1:43:53.434
Bo!

1:43:53.936 --> 1:43:57.772
Where are you, Bo?

1:43:58.106 --> 1:44:00.733
Please come out.

1:44:01.443 --> 1:44:02.735
Bo!

1:44:05.989 --> 1:44:08.282
Bo?

1:44:13.121 --> 1:44:17.458
Why, you little...

1:44:18.919 --> 1:44:22.046
Out with it!

1:44:23.507 --> 1:44:27.635
Where did you hide my Bo?

1:44:28.136 --> 1:44:29.929
He's with Zeniba.

1:44:30.055 --> 1:44:32.014
Zeniba?

1:44:53.036 --> 1:44:56.706
Now I understand.
That evil witch.

1:44:56.832 --> 1:44:59.542
She thinks she's beaten me.

1:45:01.211 --> 1:45:03.462
So, what's your plan?

1:45:03.964 --> 1:45:06.007
I'll bring him back.

1:45:06.174 --> 1:45:10.386
But you must send Sen and
her parents back to their world.

1:45:10.554 --> 1:45:12.972
And what about you?

1:45:13.223 --> 1:45:16.976
Maybe I'll send them back
and then tear you to pieces.

1:46:03.940 --> 1:46:05.566
I think this is right.

1:46:06.735 --> 1:46:08.027
Come on.

1:46:34.846 --> 1:46:36.514
You can ride on my shoulder.

1:47:55.177 --> 1:47:56.594
Come in.

1:48:01.766 --> 1:48:03.559
Thank you.

1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:07.938
Well, hurry up then.

1:48:08.440 --> 1:48:09.732
Come on.

1:48:13.028 --> 1:48:14.862
So you all made it.

1:48:14.988 --> 1:48:17.406
- I...
- Have a seat.

1:48:17.532 --> 1:48:19.783
I'll make some tea.

1:48:25.624 --> 1:48:29.877
Zeniba, Haku stole this.
I came to give it back.

1:48:33.131 --> 1:48:35.591
Do you know what this is?

1:48:35.884 --> 1:48:38.802
No, but I know it's very precious.

1:48:38.929 --> 1:48:42.556
I'm here to apologize for him.
He's sorry.

1:48:43.433 --> 1:48:46.477
You held this
and nothing happened to you?

1:48:46.603 --> 1:48:47.520
What?

1:48:47.646 --> 1:48:50.439
Wait, the protection spell is gone.

1:48:51.566 --> 1:48:54.735
I'm sorry.
There was this strange bug.

1:48:54.861 --> 1:48:56.695
I squashed it.

1:48:57.239 --> 1:48:59.365
Squashed it!

1:49:01.409 --> 1:49:04.745
My sister snuck
that bug into the dragon...

1:49:04.871 --> 1:49:07.540
so she could control him.

1:49:07.666 --> 1:49:10.292
And you squashed it!

1:49:13.088 --> 1:49:14.630
Now then, sit down.

1:49:14.798 --> 1:49:17.800
You must be No Face.
You sit, too.

1:49:18.760 --> 1:49:22.429
Please turn them back into themselves.

1:49:22.556 --> 1:49:25.599
Why my dear, the spell's long broken.

1:49:25.767 --> 1:49:28.143
They can change back any time.

1:49:35.443 --> 1:49:39.280
Yubaba and I are two halves of
a whole, but we don't get along.

1:49:39.406 --> 1:49:41.949
You know what bad taste she has.

1:49:42.117 --> 1:49:45.160
Sorceress twins are
just a recipe for trouble.

1:49:49.207 --> 1:49:53.669
I'd like to help you dear,
but there's nothing I can do.

1:49:53.795 --> 1:49:55.838
It's one of our rules here.

1:49:56.298 --> 1:49:59.300
You'll have to save your parents
and your dragon boyfriend...

1:49:59.426 --> 1:50:01.051
all by yourself.

1:50:01.177 --> 1:50:04.096
But can't you
even give me a hint?

1:50:04.472 --> 1:50:07.933
I feel like Haku and I met
a long time ago.

1:50:08.101 --> 1:50:10.102
In that case it's easy.

1:50:10.395 --> 1:50:12.938
Everything that happens
stays inside you...

1:50:13.064 --> 1:50:15.316
even if you can't remember it.

1:50:16.651 --> 1:50:19.987
It's already late.
Why don't you stay the night?

1:50:20.405 --> 1:50:23.198
You boys give me a hand.

1:50:29.331 --> 1:50:31.332
Come on, keep at it.

1:50:34.336 --> 1:50:36.837
See? You have a talent for this.

1:50:37.005 --> 1:50:38.631
You're a big help.

1:50:39.424 --> 1:50:42.676
It's not the same
when you use magic.

1:50:44.012 --> 1:50:48.349
Pull it through there.
Now do it again.

1:50:48.558 --> 1:50:51.185
Zeniba, I'm going back after all.

1:50:51.853 --> 1:50:55.314
Haku could die while I'm sitting here.

1:50:55.523 --> 1:50:59.026
And they might eat
my mom and dad!

1:51:01.196 --> 1:51:03.947
Wait just a little longer.

1:51:04.074 --> 1:51:05.616
There we are.

1:51:06.451 --> 1:51:08.410
Use it to tie back your hair.

1:51:13.750 --> 1:51:14.500
It's pretty.

1:51:14.709 --> 1:51:19.630
It'll protect you.
I made it from the thread we spun.

1:51:19.881 --> 1:51:21.173
Thank you.

1:51:30.725 --> 1:51:34.520
What good timing.
We've got another guest, let him in.

1:51:34.646 --> 1:51:35.771
Sure.

1:51:49.077 --> 1:51:50.202
Haku!

1:51:51.413 --> 1:51:52.579
Haku...

1:51:53.415 --> 1:51:54.998
I'm so glad to see you.

1:51:55.333 --> 1:51:57.793
Are you okay?
Do you feel all right?

1:51:58.086 --> 1:51:59.086
Thank goodness.

1:52:00.922 --> 1:52:03.173
Good timing, I'd say.

1:52:03.842 --> 1:52:06.301
Zeniba, Haku's alive.

1:52:06.845 --> 1:52:10.973
Haku, I no longer blame
you for what you did.

1:52:11.099 --> 1:52:14.476
But be sure to protect this girl.

1:52:14.769 --> 1:52:17.771
Okay boys, time you went home.

1:52:17.897 --> 1:52:19.940
Come see me again soon.

1:52:20.692 --> 1:52:25.028
You stay with me
and be my helper.

1:52:27.532 --> 1:52:28.490
Zeniba!

1:52:29.117 --> 1:52:31.285
Thank you, I'm going now.

1:52:31.411 --> 1:52:34.455
Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll manage just fine.

1:52:34.622 --> 1:52:37.833
My real name is Chihiro.

1:52:37.959 --> 1:52:40.461
Chihiro? What a nice name.

1:52:40.587 --> 1:52:42.463
Take good care of it.

1:52:42.589 --> 1:52:43.255
I will!

1:52:43.381 --> 1:52:45.174
Now off you go.

1:52:46.885 --> 1:52:49.970
Thank you, Zeniba.
Goodbye!

1:53:39.020 --> 1:53:40.521
Haku, listen.

1:53:40.855 --> 1:53:44.483
I don't remember this,
but my mom told me about it.

1:53:44.859 --> 1:53:48.487
Once when I was little,
I fell in a river.

1:53:48.947 --> 1:53:52.574
Now it's all built over.
It flows underground.

1:53:52.951 --> 1:53:55.077
But I just remembered.

1:53:56.204 --> 1:53:57.871
The river was called...

1:53:58.540 --> 1:54:01.416
it was called the Kohaku River.

1:54:02.043 --> 1:54:05.045
Your real name is Kohaku.

1:54:26.651 --> 1:54:28.110
Chihiro, thank you!

1:54:28.236 --> 1:54:31.488
My name is
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

1:54:31.906 --> 1:54:35.117
- Nigihayami?
- Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi.

1:54:35.285 --> 1:54:37.995
What a name!
Sounds like a guardian spirit.

1:54:38.329 --> 1:54:42.749
I remember how
you fell into me as a child.

1:54:42.876 --> 1:54:44.585
You were chasing your shoe.

1:54:44.794 --> 1:54:49.131
Yes, and you carried me
to shallow water.

1:54:50.008 --> 1:54:51.258
I'm so happy...

1:55:24.042 --> 1:55:25.459
They're back!

1:55:38.806 --> 1:55:41.433
You brought Bo back with you?

1:55:44.312 --> 1:55:45.228
Baba!

1:55:45.355 --> 1:55:49.775
Bo! You're not hurt?
What a terrible time you had.

1:55:51.027 --> 1:55:54.154
Bo, when did you learn
to stand on your own?

1:55:54.739 --> 1:55:56.657
Yubaba, remember your promise.

1:55:56.908 --> 1:55:59.910
Send Chihiro and her parents
back to their world.

1:56:00.328 --> 1:56:02.746
Sorry, but it's not that simple.

1:56:02.872 --> 1:56:05.999
This world has rules, you know.

1:56:06.626 --> 1:56:07.793
Silence!

1:56:07.919 --> 1:56:10.545
Just do it, Baba.
Don't be so mean.

1:56:10.838 --> 1:56:13.423
Baby had such a good time.

1:56:13.925 --> 1:56:16.677
But I'm just following the rule.

1:56:16.803 --> 1:56:19.179
Otherwise I can't break the spell.

1:56:19.430 --> 1:56:22.557
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore.

1:56:22.850 --> 1:56:24.184
But...

1:56:24.310 --> 1:56:25.477
Granny!

1:56:25.687 --> 1:56:27.062
Granny?

1:56:27.397 --> 1:56:29.022
I'll do as you ask.

1:56:40.868 --> 1:56:42.995
Haku told me about the rule.

1:56:43.121 --> 1:56:44.913
Well, you've got guts.

1:56:45.123 --> 1:56:48.375
I brought your contract.
Follow me.

1:56:48.543 --> 1:56:50.585
This won't take a minute, Bo.

1:56:51.587 --> 1:56:53.088
Don't worry.

1:56:57.552 --> 1:57:01.388
See if you can pick out
your parents for me.

1:57:10.732 --> 1:57:12.149
You get one guess.

1:57:12.275 --> 1:57:14.943
Pick them out
and you all go free.

1:57:26.789 --> 1:57:30.459
Granny, I can't do it.
Dad and Mom aren't here.

1:57:30.626 --> 1:57:34.212
Not here?
Is that your answer?

1:57:35.757 --> 1:57:36.798
Yes.

1:57:39.594 --> 1:57:42.888
You're right!

1:57:43.056 --> 1:57:45.515
Attagirl! Good for you.

1:57:49.479 --> 1:57:50.645
Thank you everyone.

1:57:50.772 --> 1:57:54.024
All right!
You win, just get out of here.

1:57:54.525 --> 1:57:56.443
Thanks for everything.

1:57:56.986 --> 1:57:58.487
Goodbye.

1:57:58.946 --> 1:57:59.946
Thank you.

1:58:00.114 --> 1:58:01.490
See you soon.

1:58:01.783 --> 1:58:03.533
- Haku!
- Let's go.

1:58:04.202 --> 1:58:05.410
Where's Mom and Dad?

1:58:05.536 --> 1:58:06.828
They went on ahead.

1:58:14.378 --> 1:58:15.462
The water's gone.

1:58:15.630 --> 1:58:17.380
I can't go any further.

1:58:17.799 --> 1:58:20.133
Go back the way you came.

1:58:20.301 --> 1:58:23.386
But don't look back
until you're out of the tunnel.

1:58:23.554 --> 1:58:25.639
But what about you?

1:58:26.057 --> 1:58:28.809
I'll tell Yubaba
I'm quitting my apprenticeship.

1:58:28.976 --> 1:58:31.520
I'm fine now.
I have my name back.

1:58:32.063 --> 1:58:33.855
Now I can go home too.

1:58:33.981 --> 1:58:35.315
Will we meet again somewhere?

1:58:35.483 --> 1:58:36.983
- I'm sure of it.
- Promise?

1:58:37.110 --> 1:58:37.943
Promise.

1:58:38.069 --> 1:58:40.362
Now go, and don't look back.

1:59:03.427 --> 1:59:05.011
Chihiro!

1:59:05.346 --> 1:59:08.014
Where have you been?
Hurry up.

1:59:11.519 --> 1:59:13.353
Mom! Dad!

1:59:13.479 --> 1:59:15.188
Don't go running off like that.

1:59:15.356 --> 1:59:16.356
Let's go.

1:59:17.024 --> 1:59:19.234
Mom, are you really okay?

1:59:19.360 --> 1:59:23.613
Hurry, the moving van
will be there.

1:59:33.040 --> 1:59:35.250
Hurry up, Chihiro.

1:59:43.968 --> 1:59:45.719
Watch your step.

1:59:45.845 --> 1:59:49.181
Chihiro, don't cling.
You'll make me trip.

2:00:01.402 --> 2:00:02.861
The end of the tunnel.

2:00:03.237 --> 2:00:04.487
Hey!

2:00:04.822 --> 2:00:06.198
What is it?

2:00:06.782 --> 2:00:08.909
Will you look at that.

2:00:09.994 --> 2:00:12.162
It's all dusty inside, too.

2:00:12.580 --> 2:00:14.497
- Is this somebody's joke?
- I wonder...

2:00:14.624 --> 2:00:17.042
I told you not to stop here.

2:00:22.757 --> 2:00:25.258
That's it, you're fine.

2:00:26.510 --> 2:00:28.762
We're off, Chihiro.

2:00:28.888 --> 2:00:31.598
Chihiro! Hurry up!
