WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:11.553
Okay. The right combination
is to say X is one of those

00:11.635 --> 00:13.096
and two of these.

00:14.430 --> 00:16.974
Well, let's take the equation number two.

00:17.641 --> 00:23.314
If I make a picture that satisfies
all the X, Y, Z points

00:23.397 --> 00:25.108
that solve this equation,

00:25.649 --> 00:28.152
well, first of all, the origin
is not one of them.

00:28.236 --> 00:32.157
X, Y, Z, it being zero, zero, zero,
would not solve it.

00:33.033 --> 00:36.661
So, what are some of the points
that do solve it?

00:37.746 --> 00:41.458
Now, let's see maybe if X is one and...

00:43.917 --> 00:45.753
Katelyn Ogden was a lot of things,

00:45.837 --> 00:48.506
but she wasn't particularly explosive...

00:51.634 --> 00:53.302
in any sense of the word.

00:54.345 --> 00:56.263
She was a sun dress of a person...

00:57.057 --> 01:00.018
cute, airy, inoffensive.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.855
She was quickly becoming the Dalton twins'

01:03.938 --> 01:06.566
number one marijuana customer
at Covington High.

01:06.649 --> 01:09.027
But that's hardly a reason
to pop like a zit.

01:09.109 --> 01:10.903
She's all over me!

01:10.986 --> 01:12.863
Spraying all over us.

01:13.906 --> 01:18.411
I wasn't close with Katelyn.
She was just, you know, a classmate.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.081
Someone I sat behind
or passed in the halls every day

01:21.164 --> 01:23.582
from kindergarten to senior year.

01:24.793 --> 01:26.419
We ran in different circles.

01:26.503 --> 01:29.588
But lots of people liked her.
Guys especially.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.257
I was going to ask her to prom.

01:32.299 --> 01:34.635
She was so hot.

01:35.094 --> 01:37.971
I even narrowed down motel room options
to two choices.

01:39.849 --> 01:42.185
She was so open-minded.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.646
Jed Hayes was particularly crushed.

01:46.313 --> 01:48.148
- Mara!
- Oh, my God, Tess!

01:48.233 --> 01:50.902
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Katelyn exploded.

01:50.984 --> 01:52.278
What? Like a bomb?

01:52.361 --> 01:55.197
No. Like... a balloon?

01:55.281 --> 01:56.365
What?

01:57.575 --> 01:59.201
Oh, my God, your shoes.

02:01.829 --> 02:05.750
Everyone quickly realized
Katelyn Ogden was not a suicide bomber,

02:05.834 --> 02:10.170
seeing as the only thing that blew up
was Katelyn Ogden.

02:10.254 --> 02:13.257
Her desk remained unscathed
by the Ogdenblast.

02:14.508 --> 02:18.971
The only damage her clothes took
was cosmetic.

02:20.181 --> 02:22.308
This isn't right. She was just a kid.

02:22.391 --> 02:24.728
It wasn't right. She was just a kid.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.521
This is fucking disgusting.

02:27.021 --> 02:29.733
And it was very fucking disgusting.

02:30.734 --> 02:32.736
After the unprecedented event,

02:32.818 --> 02:36.072
all of our third-period class
got taken to the police station.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.450
Which was very exciting.

02:38.532 --> 02:40.617
We got asked a lot
of important questions like...

02:40.701 --> 02:42.746
Did Katelyn ever say anything suspicious?

02:43.246 --> 02:46.249
About wanting to blow up? All the time.

02:50.544 --> 02:51.628
I was kidding.

02:57.134 --> 03:00.262
Then they took all our clothes
and let us shower.

03:00.930 --> 03:02.098
Will I get these back?

03:03.140 --> 03:04.725
Do you want these back?

03:07.937 --> 03:09.814
I only washed my hair.

03:10.939 --> 03:14.485
Then they gave us a bunch of
ugly-as-shit sweat suits and made us wait.

03:25.538 --> 03:27.832
It was like a Cronenberg movie.

03:38.926 --> 03:40.719
What do you think happened?

03:40.804 --> 03:43.306
- Aliens?
- It wasn't aliens, bro.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.474
I'm just saying.
She was there, then she wasn't.

03:45.557 --> 03:46.643
It's not fair.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.770
She was so nice.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.522
I was gonna ask her to prom.

03:50.604 --> 03:52.439
She was very open-minded.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.651
When the hell are they gonna
let us out of here?

03:54.734 --> 03:56.861
When they know
it's not gonna happen again.

03:56.944 --> 03:58.570
When what's gonna happen again?

04:10.500 --> 04:11.710
It happened again.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.504
It happened again a lot.

04:42.531 --> 04:44.450
I'm not going to school tomorrow.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.078
No shit, sweetheart.

05:10.726 --> 05:13.145
- Are you hungry?
- No, not really.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.609
Do you wanna talk?

05:18.151 --> 05:19.735
I think I just wanna go to bed.

05:21.779 --> 05:22.946
Okay, kiddo.

05:25.783 --> 05:28.411
- You know, we thought it was a shooter.
- Dad...

05:28.495 --> 05:31.497
We didn't have any information.
They didn't tell us anything.

05:34.291 --> 05:37.461
I'm just trying to say
that we're so glad you're okay.

05:38.420 --> 05:43.468
And that your classmates
are just regular assholes and not evil.

05:45.637 --> 05:48.139
That is a silver lining.

05:54.353 --> 05:55.479
Good night.

07:20.398 --> 07:23.443
- Is this song...
- Yeah, it is definitely sexual.

07:25.403 --> 07:26.653
Right on.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.987
I always wondered what happens to those
when someone dies.

08:08.697 --> 08:09.988
Fuck me.

08:10.906 --> 08:12.324
I need drugs.

08:13.992 --> 08:15.120
Shrooms?

08:16.120 --> 08:17.371
- Shrooms?
- No.

08:17.872 --> 08:21.084
Yeah. It's like weed, but a fungi.

08:21.625 --> 08:22.876
I've never had shrooms.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.295
I honestly cannot think
of a better time to start.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.880
It's a terrible time to start.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.718
I would love to start.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.143
You're going to make yourself sick.

08:38.225 --> 08:40.186
You brew 'em in liquid
so that you don't get sick.

08:40.269 --> 08:42.062
That's what Native Americans do.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.773
- In pumpkin spice lattes?
- Yeah.

08:44.190 --> 08:45.942
Pumpkins. Thanksgiving.

08:48.903 --> 08:49.903
Here.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.115
Oh, my God. I fucking love it.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.953
Tess McNulty and I have been best friends
since elementary school.

08:57.495 --> 08:59.246
Will you be my best friend forever?

08:59.330 --> 09:00.790
Obviously.

09:04.793 --> 09:07.713
When Tess' shitbrain dad
walked out on her and her mom

09:07.797 --> 09:09.673
we spent a few days at the beach,

09:09.758 --> 09:12.259
and we saw these baller old chicks
in kimonos,

09:12.344 --> 09:14.971
smoking a hookah
with their toes in the sand.

09:15.471 --> 09:16.972
Let's do this.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.850
It remains our life plan.

09:18.932 --> 09:21.101
- To Katelyn.
- To Katelyn.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.442
No. No.

09:28.525 --> 09:30.361
Stop. Stop!

09:31.321 --> 09:33.281
This is... Put...

09:34.990 --> 09:36.201
Are you done?

09:39.287 --> 09:41.163
I didn't know Katelyn that well
beyond social media.

09:41.246 --> 09:42.498
Yeah, I know. Me neither.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.250
- Did she get into college yet?
- I don't know.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.420
I know she wanted
to be a journalist though.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.839
We have too many
excellent journalists as it is.

09:51.131 --> 09:56.596
Did Katelyn at least get laid
before everything?

09:57.179 --> 09:59.431
Oh, yeah. She was a total slut.

09:59.515 --> 10:00.933
You know what? Good for her!

10:01.017 --> 10:03.311
I agree! Get it while the getting is good.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.270
The only downside is high school boys.

10:05.355 --> 10:09.024
I know. I cannot wait to be old.
I can't wait to be a cougar.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.528
I'm gonna be like, "Come hither,
young man, and pleasure me eagerly."

10:13.363 --> 10:14.989
Hey, mind if I join you guys?

10:16.448 --> 10:19.326
Tess, don't look now,
but there's a boy staring at us.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.625
I think he's staring at you.

10:26.292 --> 10:27.585
Right you are.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.672
- Hey, Dylan.
- Hey, Mara.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.298
- Hey, Tess.
- Hi, Dylan.

10:33.674 --> 10:34.717
Thanks.

10:35.342 --> 10:36.635
- How you guys doing?
- All right.

10:37.011 --> 10:39.179
Definitely the best memorial service
I've ever been to.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.472
Best funeral, too.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.017
Second best for me.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.810
My dad's was better.

10:45.352 --> 10:46.687
Well, holy shit, Dylan.

10:46.812 --> 10:50.066
It's okay.
The Ogdens can just try harder next time.

10:50.567 --> 10:51.775
Well, holy shit, Dylan.

10:51.860 --> 10:55.404
- Am I bombing this banter thing?
- Like the end of Dr. Strangelove.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.032
Don't you think that movie
is kind of ruined now?

10:57.115 --> 10:58.533
Yeah, I kind of do.

10:59.366 --> 11:00.993
What's going on?

11:01.076 --> 11:02.327
Yeah, actually, what is going on?

11:02.412 --> 11:06.331
I thought talking to you at the funeral
might be icky.

11:07.125 --> 11:08.876
- Icky?
- It's an adjective.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.295
Yeah, I know it's an adj...

11:13.298 --> 11:14.966
Holy shit!

11:15.049 --> 11:17.593
- You're the guy! You have a crush on me!
- Hello.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.388
- What's going on?
- This is the guy. This is dick pic Dylan.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.639
You sent her a dick pic?

11:22.724 --> 11:24.684
No, that would be gross!

11:24.768 --> 11:26.353
He sent me pictures of Richards.

11:26.436 --> 11:29.105
- That's worse!
- How is that worse?

11:29.563 --> 11:31.440
- Why did you text me that?
- The Richards?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.442
No. The declarative statement.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.698
Katelyn exploded in the middle of precalc,

11:38.782 --> 11:42.285
and it got me thinking about life,
in an ironic way,

11:42.369 --> 11:45.497
and what would happen
if I popped, you know.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.791
And then you said, it might happen again,

11:47.874 --> 11:52.253
and I was like, I gotta get shit done,
in case she's right.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.471
Do you wanna go
to the ladies room with me?

12:04.474 --> 12:06.017
Come on. It'll be fun.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.851
She's gonna go to the bathroom
and throw up

12:07.936 --> 12:09.687
because she just drank
a shitload of mushrooms

12:09.812 --> 12:11.855
and she wants you to hold her hair back.

12:13.857 --> 12:14.858
In that case...

12:18.363 --> 12:21.991
I'm not usually like this.
I can usually really hold my drugs.

12:23.826 --> 12:25.412
Also, I usually never do drugs.

12:25.495 --> 12:27.621
We live in strange and unusual times.

12:27.706 --> 12:29.081
That is so true.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.840
There are a lot of you.

12:39.717 --> 12:40.718
How many?

12:40.802 --> 12:43.471
I'll throw up if I count,
but more than one.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.305
That's awesome.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.268
- You should make out.
- All right.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.646
How do I do that?

12:51.687 --> 12:53.398
With your tongues.

12:54.231 --> 12:55.649
Oh, shit.

13:06.035 --> 13:10.247
I saw Katelyn's dad scratch her stick
figure sticker off the back of his car.

13:10.331 --> 13:14.168
I always wondered what happens to those
when someone dies.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.712
What happens is, I get shroomed.

13:17.547 --> 13:19.966
Hey, did you see Katelyn...

13:20.049 --> 13:21.884
Go boom? No.

13:22.844 --> 13:23.845
Did you?

13:24.888 --> 13:26.139
I only heard it.

13:27.682 --> 13:32.312
It's weird being right there
and missing it.

13:33.312 --> 13:37.524
Like, I'm sad I missed it
and that makes me feel terrible.

13:37.609 --> 13:42.072
Yeah. No, it must be so invigorating.

13:43.365 --> 13:44.698
Invigorating.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.536
Okay.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.043
You okay?

14:01.216 --> 14:02.716
Thanks for saying you like me.

14:03.509 --> 14:04.510
Sure.

14:05.386 --> 14:08.389
Hey, would you want to come with me
to the homecoming game?

14:11.893 --> 14:12.894
What?

14:14.687 --> 14:16.855
I'm trying to think of a reason to say no.

14:19.317 --> 14:22.028
- I could give you some.
- Shoot.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.782
Well, maybe just homecoming sucks?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.616
Yeah, but it's fun to make fun of.

14:28.158 --> 14:30.662
- Plus, Halloween.
- Yeah, okay.

14:31.495 --> 14:36.583
Then maybe I'm just a guy
who is interested in grief-induced sex.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.837
Way sluttier girls than me, though.

14:40.547 --> 14:42.841
Probably wouldn't stick around
while I hurled either.

14:42.923 --> 14:43.924
True.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.553
Well, maybe you just don't really know me.

14:49.014 --> 14:50.472
But I do know you.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.225
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah!

14:53.058 --> 14:54.727
You're in a bunch of my classes.

14:55.269 --> 14:57.688
You're a movie nerd. You're pretty cute.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.567
Your dad died
when a bunch of manure fell on him.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.864
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I just realized I said that out loud.

15:05.947 --> 15:09.616
- Now you have to come to the game with me.
- I really do.

15:09.701 --> 15:12.037
- I'm so sorry.
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.830
I blame the shrooms.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.499
Okay. Yes. Thank you.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.377
My dad was a farmer.

15:19.461 --> 15:21.004
But he died of a heart attack.

15:21.712 --> 15:25.049
The rumor of him
being crushed to death by shit is false.

15:25.133 --> 15:28.345
And impossible, if you've seen
any Back to the Future movie.

15:32.057 --> 15:33.307
Kids are cruel.

15:34.183 --> 15:36.685
- I'm really sorry.
- It's okay.

15:38.355 --> 15:39.563
We're all cruel.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.572
Today was weird.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.283
Tonight was all right.

15:52.826 --> 15:55.955
Yeah. Tonight was all right.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.091
This isn't gonna become
a regular thing, right?

16:07.174 --> 16:08.550
The intoxication?

16:10.260 --> 16:13.055
No. No. I just needed...

16:15.975 --> 16:17.601
I don't know what I needed.

16:19.729 --> 16:21.272
Have you cried yet?

16:24.274 --> 16:25.485
Have you?

16:26.735 --> 16:28.237
I cry all the time.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.787
It's just not the same without the blood.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.538
I just look like a stupid prom queen.

16:37.621 --> 16:40.250
I should have just dressed up
as a sexy witch too.

16:40.332 --> 16:42.084
I'm just a normal witch.

16:42.168 --> 16:43.503
Not even cleavagey.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.088
Girl, your sexiness is unavoidable.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.300
Shit. They've built her a shrine.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.597
Hey, there's dick pic.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.558
Hello, Quaker Oats.

16:57.642 --> 16:58.810
Are you supposed to be Carrie?

16:58.893 --> 17:01.021
Yes! Oh, my God, thank you!

17:01.104 --> 17:03.189
Yeah. No, it's great. I mean,
it would have been really cool...

17:03.273 --> 17:05.525
- Don't say it.
- I know. Katelyn fucked it up.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.319
I mean, she didn't intentionally...

17:09.403 --> 17:10.779
You're making it worse.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.201
Your hat.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.996
Hey, will you stop? I don't know you.

17:24.544 --> 17:28.214
So, what gives, Hipster Oats?

17:28.589 --> 17:30.674
Our football team are the Quakers.

17:30.759 --> 17:34.346
No, not your costume.
The crush you say you have on me.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.892
I want, like, a timeline.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.230
So...

17:45.940 --> 17:47.025
First day of school.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.942
New town after my dad died.

17:49.027 --> 17:52.822
First time I saw you is right after Spiros
introduced me in front of the class.

17:52.905 --> 17:54.907
You must be Dylan. Welcome.

17:55.366 --> 17:58.036
Class, I'd like for you to meet
Mr. Dylan Hovemeyer.

17:58.118 --> 18:02.499
He's new here, so please,
don't be yourselves. Be nice.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.630
It was a good first impression.

18:10.882 --> 18:13.468
A few weeks later,
I saw you at the Moonlight,

18:13.550 --> 18:16.387
and when Jed tried wrapping his arm
around you...

18:21.017 --> 18:23.687
And then, on the day after the election...

18:25.270 --> 18:27.190
Mara, why are you wearing that?

18:27.272 --> 18:29.233
Because I'm motherfucking grieving.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.236
You got detention for the profanity.

18:31.318 --> 18:33.070
Motherfucking worth it.

18:34.571 --> 18:37.366
It's clichéd,
but you wrote a poem last spring

18:37.450 --> 18:41.830
that made me feel like you understood me,
even though we barely talked.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.207
I friended you on Facebook afterwards.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.084
I looked at your pictures sometimes.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.877
I even gave you my number,
but I think you forgot

18:48.961 --> 18:51.172
or never saved it in your phone.

18:51.256 --> 18:54.759
I hoped we'd run into each other
during the summer but never did.

18:55.384 --> 19:00.140
And then it was senior year and I thought,
why try? We're going to college.

19:00.890 --> 19:06.646
And that made me sad, because
you seemed so cool and original.

19:08.565 --> 19:09.816
But then...

19:12.152 --> 19:14.362
When Katelyn died,
I didn't see you anywhere.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.866
You had two backpacks.
One of them was hers.

19:22.537 --> 19:23.829
Are you okay?

19:25.039 --> 19:26.582
I don't know what to do with this.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.292
I can take care of it for you.

19:37.551 --> 19:38.802
When what happens again?

19:45.309 --> 19:47.436
And when you said it might happen again,

19:47.519 --> 19:51.148
I thought, whoa,
maybe I've been wasting my entire life

19:51.231 --> 19:54.109
preparing for a year
that may never come for me.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.611
So fuck it.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.364
I'm going to tell you how I feel.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.157
I'm going to spend my savings on a car.

20:00.240 --> 20:02.951
I'm not going to be scared anymore.
I'm not...

20:05.038 --> 20:07.332
Wait, are you even listening to me?

20:08.540 --> 20:10.125
Yeah. Sorry. No.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.044
Seriously, that was wonderful.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.673
I don't want you to think
I was not paying attention...

20:14.756 --> 20:18.134
'Cause it kind of looks like
you're just taking pictures of the game.

20:18.218 --> 20:21.179
No! No. Not of the game.
Never of the game.

20:22.346 --> 20:26.558
I'm waiting
for the "We Love Cocks" moment.

20:27.268 --> 20:30.521
I would have never guessed
that was what was about to be said.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.774
Okay. Look.

20:32.856 --> 20:38.278
Every game, Harper Wie, Perry Love
and Steve Cox, for just one brief moment,

20:38.363 --> 20:41.157
line up for the "We Love Cocks" moment.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.951
- That's so immature.
- It really is.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.877
I have a moment for you...

20:54.878 --> 20:56.588
where I knew I liked you.

20:58.842 --> 21:00.051
You like me?

21:00.969 --> 21:02.095
Maybe.

21:06.182 --> 21:07.976
It was, like, forever ago.

21:08.058 --> 21:11.730
And I was just chilling and then
you looked me in the eye and you said,

21:11.813 --> 21:13.230
"Mara...

21:15.107 --> 21:16.900
we love cocks."

21:19.570 --> 21:20.738
Mara...

21:21.573 --> 21:24.409
we love cocks.

21:30.373 --> 21:31.708
Did something happen?

22:09.871 --> 22:12.874
Perry Love was that guy
that just made everything better.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.920
He was like air conditioning.
And then he was news.

22:17.628 --> 22:18.921
We all became news.

22:19.005 --> 22:22.801
The popping was given the sexy moniker
of "The Covington Curse."

22:23.425 --> 22:25.010
Stupid fucking curse.

22:25.095 --> 22:26.971
By the way, Perry Love was gay.

22:27.055 --> 22:29.057
I didn't even know that
until the memorial.

22:29.140 --> 22:32.769
And when my bro came out to us
in sixth grade, we loved him.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.645
Come on.

22:34.729 --> 22:36.271
Because he was our best bro.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.400
And we're progressive like that.

22:41.152 --> 22:42.278
Our boy...

22:44.029 --> 22:46.657
Our boy was too much rock
for this world, bitch!

22:51.871 --> 22:53.206
It was a nice moment.

22:53.832 --> 22:55.709
Of course, what we didn't know
at the time was...

22:55.791 --> 22:57.251
School's canceled.

23:00.422 --> 23:01.673
For how long?

23:05.844 --> 23:07.761
But we're just going to
keep applying to colleges.

23:07.846 --> 23:10.682
So you'll be all set once this blows over.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.732
Well, at least now you can't say,

23:18.815 --> 23:20.942
"Things were so much harder
back in my day."

23:23.236 --> 23:24.612
You're right.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.781
You have it way worse.

23:53.641 --> 23:55.143
Oh, my God.

23:55.934 --> 23:58.937
Of course, you don't drive a Hyundai
or something like that.

23:59.730 --> 24:01.357
It reminded me of this Springsteen song.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.361
- Which one?
- The one about the milk truck driver.

24:04.443 --> 24:06.570
There's a Springsteen song
about a milk truck driver?

24:06.653 --> 24:10.157
- Guess you'll have to find out.
- I swear to God, I'm never gonna find out.

24:10.240 --> 24:11.576
I just bought it today.

24:12.951 --> 24:14.162
Why?

24:16.748 --> 24:20.669
I was saving up for a college car,
but then I thought I might die tomorrow.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.961
- So I went to the dealer...
- Of milk trucks.

24:23.046 --> 24:26.758
And I saw it and I laughed and I thought
other people would laugh too.

24:26.840 --> 24:29.176
It was cheap, so why not?

24:30.178 --> 24:32.347
Just get me through till graduation, baby.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.348
That should be our school slogan.

24:34.932 --> 24:36.017
It really should.

24:36.601 --> 24:37.644
You ready to go?

24:38.228 --> 24:39.395
In your milk truck?

24:40.230 --> 24:41.230
Fuck, yeah.

24:41.815 --> 24:42.816
Fuck, no!

24:43.566 --> 24:45.192
We are never forgetting them!

24:50.740 --> 24:52.282
- I love you, bro.
- I love you too, man.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.243
I love you guys too.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.915
I really need this drink.
Can I take it? Please?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.085
- Why, why, why?
- Please, please. I'm gonna grab it.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.128
- Okay?
- Okay.

25:04.211 --> 25:05.379
Have fun.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.431
You wanna go for a walk?

25:16.307 --> 25:17.599
I love walks.

25:26.984 --> 25:29.862
- How's your drink?
- It's very tequila-y.

25:30.696 --> 25:33.907
Hey, are you drinking...
Yeah, you're drinking straight tequila.

25:33.991 --> 25:36.076
I mean... no?

25:37.244 --> 25:38.912
I'm just drinking beer.

25:38.997 --> 25:40.331
Drink big, bro!

25:41.583 --> 25:43.915
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

25:43.917 --> 25:46.211
What if alcohol is what makes it happen?

25:48.131 --> 25:49.798
No!

25:57.973 --> 25:59.350
What do you think does?

26:00.934 --> 26:01.935
I don't know.

26:02.019 --> 26:04.314
- That's not good enough!
- Well, I don't!

26:04.897 --> 26:07.817
The cosmic bullshit
of the universe, right?

26:08.609 --> 26:10.611
- Lame.
- I'm sorry.

26:16.076 --> 26:18.661
I'm writing this book
called All The Feels.

26:19.203 --> 26:21.538
It's about this guy
who when he touches people,

26:21.623 --> 26:23.917
he takes all their feelings
and then they die.

26:25.501 --> 26:28.797
I just wanted you to know something
about me that no one else does.

26:29.547 --> 26:31.758
- Are you drunk?
- Dude, yeah.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.176
- Are you?
- No.

26:35.886 --> 26:37.638
How many cups have you had?

26:39.766 --> 26:40.892
I don't know.

26:41.476 --> 26:42.894
Oh, shit.

26:45.145 --> 26:46.772
Tell me something, just for me.

26:49.983 --> 26:53.654
Okay, well, after my dad died,

26:54.321 --> 26:59.159
I would go to this old barn
with a tape player

26:59.243 --> 27:01.036
and dance by myself.

27:02.247 --> 27:03.914
Like, to Bon Jovi.

27:05.541 --> 27:07.501
Yeah, I'd just cry and dance

27:07.585 --> 27:11.338
and then rewind and cry and dance.

27:11.423 --> 27:14.092
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

27:14.718 --> 27:16.970
And people are literally blowing up.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.099
Actually, they're not just people.

27:22.808 --> 27:24.644
They're seniors.

27:24.728 --> 27:26.855
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.733
Also, we stopped walking.

27:32.902 --> 27:34.821
The shocks keep coming.

27:46.082 --> 27:48.251
I really wanna kiss you, man.

27:49.752 --> 27:50.878
Yeah?

27:51.962 --> 27:53.048
Yeah.

28:21.910 --> 28:24.120
- We should probably go, right?
- No.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.127
You taste like tequila.

28:48.811 --> 28:50.270
Fuck me.

28:59.948 --> 29:02.784
Special Agent Rosetti.
Thank you, ladies, for coming in.

29:03.367 --> 29:06.913
Let me be the first to say,
I'm... I'm truly sorry.

29:06.996 --> 29:09.874
- It's okay.
- Yeah. I mean, it could be worse, right?

29:09.958 --> 29:11.375
We could be Republicans.

29:12.836 --> 29:13.877
That was funny.

29:14.712 --> 29:15.922
Thank you.

29:16.006 --> 29:19.509
So, you ladies blow people up?

29:20.926 --> 29:22.011
No, ma'am.

29:23.179 --> 29:25.223
Do you think there's someone
killing everyone?

29:25.306 --> 29:27.726
I think we've effectively ruled that out.

29:27.808 --> 29:31.186
I mean, unless there's a mad scientist
or a warlock on the loose.

29:31.270 --> 29:35.191
Kids are literally blowing up, so, I mean,
that could be a possibility, right?

29:35.942 --> 29:37.693
If you believe in warlocks.

29:38.694 --> 29:40.821
I don't know what I believe anymore.

29:42.031 --> 29:45.076
Do you have any idea
why it's happening, though?

29:46.036 --> 29:49.038
At the moment, no.

29:49.122 --> 29:51.583
But we're close to figuring it out.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.003
Or so I'm told.

29:57.756 --> 29:59.966
Wait, so what you're saying is,
we're fucked.

30:00.049 --> 30:02.634
No. What I'm saying is that I need help.

30:04.095 --> 30:07.640
Listen. Everyone's scared,
and scared people all want the same thing.

30:07.723 --> 30:09.224
Which is?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.394
To survive.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.063
- Right.
- Yeah.

30:14.814 --> 30:16.983
- We would actually love to survive.
- Yeah.

30:17.067 --> 30:18.777
- That'd be sick.
- Good.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.153
So bring me something.

30:23.114 --> 30:24.406
What do you want?

30:26.576 --> 30:27.576
Drugs?

30:27.660 --> 30:29.204
That's what she said.

30:29.287 --> 30:31.456
She thinks drugs is making us pop?

30:31.538 --> 30:33.958
I think it's less accusational and more,

30:34.041 --> 30:37.586
what the holy fuck is going on,
let's rule shit out-onal.

30:38.003 --> 30:41.799
So, you're not gonna tell
this Scully wannabe they came from us?

30:41.883 --> 30:45.386
Girl, do I look
like Benicio Del Toro to you?

30:48.056 --> 30:49.307
I don't know what that means.

30:49.391 --> 30:52.227
Me neither. I need to rewatch Traffic.

30:53.769 --> 30:55.355
We're gonna sidebar.

30:55.438 --> 30:57.273
- Do your thing.
- Okay.

31:00.484 --> 31:01.902
What? What do you think?

31:01.986 --> 31:04.197
I think we gotta get rid of them.

31:04.989 --> 31:06.700
- I got her to go for it too.
- Okay.

31:07.991 --> 31:10.828
All right, we're down. What do you want?

31:10.912 --> 31:12.247
That's the best part.

31:12.329 --> 31:14.374
America's reimbursing me.

31:16.459 --> 31:18.586
- So you're buying...
- Everything.

31:23.674 --> 31:24.759
God bless America!

31:24.843 --> 31:27.220
Okay. I'm gonna get the keys.

31:27.303 --> 31:28.388
Keys?

31:29.847 --> 31:31.807
We don't keep our shit at home.

31:33.183 --> 31:34.728
We hide it.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.730
Never know when the feds
are gonna fuck ya.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.482
I have a question.

31:40.567 --> 31:41.942
Suitcase-related?

31:42.027 --> 31:43.653
Suitcase-related.

31:43.737 --> 31:45.989
- Leaving Jersey tomorrow.
- Yeah.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.781
Getting the fuck outta Dodge.

31:47.865 --> 31:49.408
Do you guys think it's Covington?

31:49.491 --> 31:52.578
I don't know what it is, but I also
don't really want to find out.

31:53.454 --> 31:55.956
So how you been holding up
during all this garbage?

31:57.208 --> 31:58.752
Hanging in, yo.

31:58.835 --> 32:00.920
Started making out with a real sweet boy.

32:01.003 --> 32:02.796
No shit! Who?

32:02.881 --> 32:04.257
I'll see you in twenty.
Don't do shrooms!

32:04.715 --> 32:05.883
Hovemeyer.

32:07.218 --> 32:08.553
You know, the world is a cra...

32:17.686 --> 32:20.606
Fuck! Go, go, go!

32:20.690 --> 32:22.275
- Fuck!
- It's flooded with Joe.

32:22.358 --> 32:24.234
Hurry! Jenna, come on!

32:24.318 --> 32:27.404
Wait. I can't see anything. I can't...

32:27.489 --> 32:30.325
- Put your foot on the brake.
- His shoes are there.

32:30.407 --> 32:32.659
I'll move his shoes. Just steer.

33:22.585 --> 33:23.711
Mara!

33:25.337 --> 33:26.548
Mara!

33:30.759 --> 33:31.927
Mara!

33:32.679 --> 33:33.805
Mara!

33:34.888 --> 33:36.015
Mara.

33:37.642 --> 33:39.269
Are you okay? Are you okay?

33:42.313 --> 33:44.983
Are you okay? Where's Joe and Jenna?

33:45.066 --> 33:47.777
- I think they're dead.
- They are?

33:49.278 --> 33:53.282
I tried to get them off,
but they won't come out of my clothes.

33:54.409 --> 33:56.076
I thought it was you.

34:15.972 --> 34:18.682
No. Dude, the sweat suit?

34:18.766 --> 34:21.226
Sorry, I just didn't have time to think.

34:22.019 --> 34:23.313
I'm not wearing this.

34:27.317 --> 34:28.568
Hey, I called Rosetti.

34:29.693 --> 34:30.695
Smart.

34:41.039 --> 34:42.791
What was it like?

34:47.336 --> 34:49.463
It really fucking sucked.

35:03.811 --> 35:06.230
What the hell is this ET bullshit?

35:09.525 --> 35:11.610
Hey. Hey.

35:11.695 --> 35:13.405
Hey, get your fucking hands off of him!

35:13.487 --> 35:16.323
- Hey, get your fucking hands off of him!
- Hey, don't grab her!

35:16.407 --> 35:18.742
- Put her down! Stop!
- Get your fucking hands off of me!

35:18.827 --> 35:21.204
- Mara!
- Get your hands off of me right now!

35:21.286 --> 35:22.830
- Mara!
- I said, get off!

35:33.173 --> 35:36.635
Mara, I'm Dr. Rolanda.

35:37.804 --> 35:39.222
We're here to help you, okay?

35:40.556 --> 35:42.349
Help yourself, lady.

36:02.829 --> 36:04.080
Okay.

36:04.164 --> 36:07.042
This is just going to be
monitoring your vitals. That's all it is.

36:08.501 --> 36:10.670
We're just going to do
a little bit of blood work.

36:10.753 --> 36:13.088
Just making sure
that everything is normalized.

36:13.172 --> 36:15.632
We're gonna get you out of here
in no time.

36:15.717 --> 36:18.677
- Okay, okay.
- All right. It's okay, it's okay.

36:20.972 --> 36:22.599
ET.

36:29.688 --> 36:30.690
Elliott.

36:34.068 --> 36:36.362
ET.

36:37.780 --> 36:39.865
Elliott.

36:39.949 --> 36:42.911
ET!

36:42.994 --> 36:44.621
Elliott!

36:45.663 --> 36:49.333
ET!

36:59.552 --> 37:00.762
Hey, Mara.

37:03.014 --> 37:05.392
Mara. Hey.

37:06.601 --> 37:07.602
Yo.

37:10.355 --> 37:11.563
Where are we?

37:13.400 --> 37:14.567
I don't know.

37:15.275 --> 37:17.528
But I think they're doing tests on us.

37:17.612 --> 37:19.114
The whole class is here.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.545
They asked me a bunch of questions.

37:36.172 --> 37:37.298
Like what?

37:37.840 --> 37:40.426
Like what I've had to eat and drink
in the past couple months,

37:40.510 --> 37:42.512
and the places I've visited.

37:43.221 --> 37:45.597
And my list of sexual partners.

37:46.641 --> 37:47.767
What did you say?

37:49.476 --> 37:52.480
I just told them... your mom.

37:55.190 --> 37:58.235
- Nice.
- I knew you'd like that one.

38:02.282 --> 38:03.408
Have you ever done it?

38:08.621 --> 38:09.831
Are you gonna ask me?

38:13.126 --> 38:14.919
I don't actually care.

38:15.795 --> 38:17.255
You don't?

38:18.340 --> 38:19.548
No.

38:19.632 --> 38:23.677
Just don't, like, screw anyone
while you're my girlfriend.

38:25.472 --> 38:26.681
Am I your girlfriend?

38:28.474 --> 38:29.893
- Are you?
- Am I?

38:31.936 --> 38:34.105
Do you wanna be my girlfriend?

38:39.818 --> 38:41.820
I guess that would be fine.

38:46.576 --> 38:47.702
Cool.

38:54.541 --> 38:56.543
What's gonna happen to us now?

38:57.628 --> 39:00.923
I think we just, you know, date.

39:02.300 --> 39:04.552
No, I meant in this plastic world.

39:08.139 --> 39:12.519
I think this is our life now.

39:24.905 --> 39:28.367
So, our beloved government
quarantined us in tents,

39:28.451 --> 39:31.538
trying to make pills that would
keep our blood inside our bodies.

39:31.621 --> 39:32.706
It was a blast.

39:33.206 --> 39:34.958
What's your name for the record, please?

39:35.041 --> 39:36.876
Mara Carlyle.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.128
Cox. Steve Cox.

39:39.211 --> 39:41.047
- Cole.
- Cole what?

39:41.715 --> 39:43.967
Cole wants a lawyer.

39:44.884 --> 39:47.887
- How old are you, Becky?
- Seventeen.

39:47.971 --> 39:49.806
- Seventeen.
- I'm 17.

39:51.016 --> 39:52.392
Not for long.

39:53.643 --> 39:55.686
What can you tell me about Katelyn Ogden?

39:55.769 --> 39:58.523
She's hot. I'd tap it.

39:59.190 --> 40:00.942
I was gonna take her to prom.

40:01.025 --> 40:02.943
Tell me about Perry Love.

40:03.027 --> 40:04.153
He was hot.

40:05.030 --> 40:06.197
I'd tap that too.

40:06.280 --> 40:09.034
- What did you dream about last night?
- Doughnuts.

40:09.117 --> 40:10.785
You can ask my lawyer.

40:10.869 --> 40:13.954
- Do you get angry, Becky?
- Yeah, I'm angry all the time.

40:14.039 --> 40:16.666
- Are you angry right now?
- Fuck, yeah.

40:16.750 --> 40:19.585
What is it you want to do in college?

40:20.795 --> 40:22.422
Stay alive.

40:27.302 --> 40:28.928
At least we were comfortable.

40:29.637 --> 40:31.264
So uncomfortable.

40:33.349 --> 40:34.808
Always smells weird in here.

40:35.601 --> 40:38.730
Like feet and cinnamon buns.

40:40.190 --> 40:41.483
Yeah, more feet.

40:45.612 --> 40:46.780
You okay?

40:49.490 --> 40:51.076
What if it happens to you?

40:52.952 --> 40:55.538
- It won't.
- How do you know that?

40:57.831 --> 40:59.000
Promise.

40:59.918 --> 41:01.211
I can't promise you.

41:01.293 --> 41:03.170
No, why? Just promise me.

41:04.838 --> 41:06.048
Promise or I'll scream.

41:11.721 --> 41:13.472
- Stop it.
- Promise. Please.

41:13.556 --> 41:15.099
It'll be fine.

41:16.226 --> 41:20.980
That's not very convincing.
But if you go, like, I'm coming.

41:21.606 --> 41:23.942
And if I go, I'm taking you too.

41:25.275 --> 41:28.987
I'm serious.
We're being roomies down there.

41:29.072 --> 41:30.699
'Cause we both know
we're not going up there.

41:30.782 --> 41:33.117
I'm fucking down. I love you. Oh, my God.

41:33.201 --> 41:34.952
- I love you too.
- Down to that.

41:46.505 --> 41:49.466
I am so bored!

41:50.802 --> 41:52.512
I'm so bored!

41:52.594 --> 41:54.388
How long do we have to stay
in this condom?

41:54.472 --> 41:56.057
For a while, I think.

41:56.141 --> 41:58.351
At least we know we're super healthy.

42:00.603 --> 42:02.563
- We should try to break out.
- I already tried that.

42:03.023 --> 42:04.566
Why would we try and break out?

42:04.648 --> 42:06.859
I got here as soon as I heard
about this place.

42:06.943 --> 42:08.403
This is where they're going to cure us.

42:08.485 --> 42:12.489
Those conservative weirdos with the signs,
they said that we were cursed.

42:12.574 --> 42:16.244
Everyone's online trying to figure out
why it's happening and who's next.

42:16.911 --> 42:18.663
Whose fault do they think it is?

42:18.746 --> 42:20.581
Bro, it's no one's fault.

42:21.791 --> 42:23.710
But if it's a curse, it's someone's fault.

42:23.793 --> 42:25.211
But, bro, there's no curse.

42:26.128 --> 42:28.047
I don't care why it's happening.

42:28.130 --> 42:29.882
I just want to figure out how to stop it.

42:29.965 --> 42:31.967
Maybe we just have to graduate.

42:36.056 --> 42:39.016
I'm looking at you right now
and really feel like we should make out.

42:39.601 --> 42:40.643
Stop.

42:41.978 --> 42:43.855
- Stop making that face.
- What face?

42:51.528 --> 42:53.197
Hey. How are you doing?

42:54.324 --> 42:55.407
Right now?

42:56.451 --> 43:00.121
No. I mean, like,
with the Daltons and everything.

43:01.539 --> 43:03.750
Can we talk about it later?

43:05.835 --> 43:08.045
I just want you to know
you can talk to me.

43:08.672 --> 43:10.798
I'd rather just make out with you.

43:10.882 --> 43:14.552
- But later, I mean.
- There is no later.

43:17.137 --> 43:19.223
That was fucking deep, son.

43:20.516 --> 43:21.934
That's what your mom said.

43:22.434 --> 43:24.269
That was great!

43:28.023 --> 43:30.275
We know these are scary times.

43:30.735 --> 43:34.948
But with your help, we are sure
a cure is right around the corner.

43:38.702 --> 43:40.412
Now, we know this hasn't been ideal,

43:40.494 --> 43:45.000
but we're doing everything we can to help
solve this problem as quickly as possible.

43:45.083 --> 43:48.711
We in Washington will continue
to push forward to find a cure,

43:48.795 --> 43:52.673
so that you good kids can go back
to the lives that you so richly deserve.

43:53.925 --> 43:55.844
Now, does anybody have any questions?

43:55.927 --> 43:57.429
- Yeah.
- Yes.

43:57.512 --> 43:59.597
Firstly, thank you for talking to us.

43:59.681 --> 44:00.974
- Super cool.
- You're very welcome.

44:01.056 --> 44:03.434
Secondly, how come whenever
someone from Washington

44:03.518 --> 44:05.311
says that they're doing everything
to help us,

44:05.394 --> 44:09.231
it usually means that nothing
is getting done and we're all screwed?

44:13.485 --> 44:15.279
Perhaps my PowerPoint wasn't clear...

44:15.362 --> 44:17.740
No, it was clear. It just sucked.

44:18.324 --> 44:20.994
Unless this is a magical slide show
that can cure us,

44:21.077 --> 44:24.706
I don't get what you're doing
that can actually help us.

44:24.789 --> 44:27.500
Hey, I get it. I do.

44:27.583 --> 44:29.626
You have every reason to be angry.

44:29.710 --> 44:33.881
But I just want all of you to know that
you have all of our thoughts and prayers.

44:35.842 --> 44:37.427
I don't want that shit unless it works.

44:38.052 --> 44:40.054
If you can't fix us, then just tell us.

44:40.137 --> 44:42.514
We have too many assclowns
lying to us as it is.

44:42.599 --> 44:43.807
Mara is right.

44:44.516 --> 44:46.101
You politicians don't care about us.

44:46.186 --> 44:49.105
The only people who care about us is us.

44:49.188 --> 44:51.815
Quakers! Yeah, baby!

44:51.900 --> 44:53.360
Quakers! Quakers!

44:53.443 --> 44:54.861
Quakers! Quakers!

44:54.943 --> 44:56.695
Quakers! Quakers! Quakers!

46:14.606 --> 46:16.025
Go fuck yourself.

47:04.449 --> 47:05.492
Mom.

47:13.416 --> 47:14.918
Yes!

47:17.628 --> 47:19.880
Wait. Where are all
the Christmas decorations?

47:21.382 --> 47:24.051
I don't think people
felt very festive this year, you know.

47:25.719 --> 47:27.179
- Yeah.
- Bummer.

47:43.445 --> 47:45.699
Oh, my God! You got a tree!

47:45.782 --> 47:47.158
We got a tree!

47:47.242 --> 47:49.994
Oh, my God! This is so cool!

47:50.077 --> 47:52.579
A real one too.
Not one of those fake ones.

47:52.664 --> 47:54.874
We gotta put some more ornaments
on this thing.

47:54.958 --> 47:57.836
I'm gonna go get changed.
I'm gonna go get changed. Wait right here.

47:58.253 --> 48:01.423
I'm home!

48:02.757 --> 48:03.967
Room!

48:05.677 --> 48:08.555
Are they really gonna call the pill
the Snooze Button?

48:08.637 --> 48:11.016
That's what that Dr. Rolanda lady
said on the news.

48:11.099 --> 48:12.392
Yeah. I know her.

48:12.851 --> 48:14.269
She's pretty professional.

48:15.228 --> 48:16.604
For a bitch.

48:16.688 --> 48:19.648
She can call it whatever she wants
as long as it works.

48:20.190 --> 48:21.275
True that.

48:23.193 --> 48:25.447
That is a sweet tree.

48:26.405 --> 48:27.407
Hey.

48:32.871 --> 48:34.079
This feels like a trap.

48:34.164 --> 48:36.750
We know you smoke pot.
You're terrible at hiding it.

48:36.833 --> 48:38.251
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

48:39.835 --> 48:41.670
Just let him be the cool dad.

48:46.425 --> 48:48.802
You're busted. I'm just joking.

48:57.478 --> 48:58.730
Come on.

49:09.907 --> 49:12.034
Is this what adulthood is like?

49:12.952 --> 49:18.083
Yeah, it's like this, except with
more anxiety and complete terror.

49:20.293 --> 49:22.461
We just gotta get you through graduation.

49:23.338 --> 49:27.050
Everyone keeps saying that.
You really think that's the winner?

49:29.760 --> 49:31.346
I gotta think something.

49:35.474 --> 49:36.976
Sick tree!

49:58.914 --> 50:01.668
I don't think I've ever been
in a girl's room before.

50:02.918 --> 50:04.086
I mean, one that I've dated.

50:04.170 --> 50:06.798
Well, I guess you can
tick that off your bucket list.

50:10.385 --> 50:11.928
Also, I got you a present.

50:12.012 --> 50:14.764
No! I haven't had time to get you one.

50:17.434 --> 50:18.435
What?

50:20.853 --> 50:22.021
What is it?

50:23.023 --> 50:25.608
It's my body...

50:27.568 --> 50:30.904
in a sexual situation.

50:38.788 --> 50:40.248
Never gotten that before.

50:42.083 --> 50:43.376
You okay?

50:49.882 --> 50:51.467
Can I tell you something?

50:52.385 --> 50:53.428
Yeah.

50:55.637 --> 50:58.849
I'm just so glad
I didn't explode all over you.

51:01.436 --> 51:03.563
I just kept thinking,
please don't explode.

51:03.646 --> 51:05.481
Please don't explode.

51:05.565 --> 51:08.275
- You guys have it so tough.
- So tough.

51:11.112 --> 51:12.572
I really like you.

51:14.490 --> 51:16.076
I really like you too.

51:33.217 --> 51:35.094
Do you think we're safe now?

51:37.179 --> 51:39.473
I don't know. I hope so.

51:40.182 --> 51:42.393
I say we just stick to the plan,
go back to school

51:42.476 --> 51:44.186
and take it one day at a time.

51:44.269 --> 51:45.396
What?

51:47.065 --> 51:49.400
- What to what?
- The school part.

51:51.110 --> 51:52.778
You didn't hear?

51:53.362 --> 51:54.905
No!

51:54.989 --> 51:56.574
Come on. Go!

51:57.157 --> 51:59.451
Move! Come on!

52:00.869 --> 52:01.913
Move!

52:04.289 --> 52:06.918
All the other classes
are meeting at the community center

52:07.001 --> 52:08.503
so they don't catch our disease.

52:08.585 --> 52:09.795
Why?

52:10.463 --> 52:11.840
It could be worse.

52:12.673 --> 52:13.675
How?

52:14.134 --> 52:15.427
We could be like Katelyn.

52:15.510 --> 52:18.596
Katelyn wasn't the first person
I saw blow up.

52:19.472 --> 52:21.182
When I was stationed...

52:22.307 --> 52:27.438
I saw a buddy of mine, Mark Jensen,
step on a land mine.

52:27.938 --> 52:29.732
No goodbyes, no last words.

52:29.815 --> 52:32.943
Just... that's it.

52:34.403 --> 52:35.572
That was it.

52:36.697 --> 52:39.783
I'm not about to sit here and tell you
that everything is gonna be okay,

52:39.867 --> 52:41.161
because that's bullshit.

52:41.994 --> 52:43.454
I mean, I don't know.

52:45.081 --> 52:47.876
But I do know
that I will help you graduate.

52:49.126 --> 52:51.086
- That sound good?
- Yeah.

52:51.170 --> 52:52.172
Yeah?

52:54.798 --> 52:56.092
Cole.

52:58.302 --> 52:59.887
Can I get a bathroom pass?

53:04.059 --> 53:05.268
Just go, man.

53:30.918 --> 53:33.128
You're not gonna abduct us again, are you?

53:33.213 --> 53:35.048
Firstly, I never did that.

53:35.130 --> 53:37.091
Secondly, no.

53:37.175 --> 53:38.677
We're really confident that the Snooze...

53:38.760 --> 53:40.679
Don't say it.

53:42.764 --> 53:44.891
Snooze Button.

53:46.059 --> 53:47.143
Fuck.

53:47.226 --> 53:48.769
What do you have against it?

53:49.228 --> 53:52.064
- Literally just the name.
- Okay. What would you call it?

53:52.190 --> 53:54.943
I don't know. Something sciencey.

53:55.025 --> 53:57.903
It has a sciencey name
that nobody remembers.

53:57.987 --> 54:01.825
Why? 'Cause it's a dozen syllables long.
Hence, the nickname.

54:01.907 --> 54:04.993
Thank you so much for FBI-splaining
the concept of nicknames to me.

54:05.077 --> 54:07.663
You're welcome. Now get out of here.
You're healthy.

54:11.543 --> 54:12.794
Why are you still here?

54:14.128 --> 54:16.422
In my office? 'Cause I work here.

54:16.505 --> 54:19.134
No, like, if you think
it's all done and cured,

54:19.217 --> 54:20.552
why are you still here?

54:21.052 --> 54:23.762
There are a dozen grunts
that can take my blood pressure.

54:23.847 --> 54:24.848
You have a badge.

54:24.931 --> 54:26.599
Everyone here has a badge.

54:28.726 --> 54:30.436
You don't think it's done, do you?

54:33.815 --> 54:36.735
You know what they say. Hope for the best.

54:37.152 --> 54:38.778
Prepare for the worst!

54:40.612 --> 54:42.448
- Is that a sex thing?
- No.

54:42.907 --> 54:44.867
But maybe. Ready?

54:48.288 --> 54:50.248
- Yeah.
- You're good. Just go forward.

54:50.331 --> 54:51.666
Am I gonna hurt myself?

54:51.750 --> 54:54.585
You probably will,
but it won't be my fault.

54:55.503 --> 54:57.797
- What are you doing?
- I don't know. I'm just scared.

54:57.880 --> 54:59.590
- Why are you scared?
- I don't know.

54:59.673 --> 55:01.509
- I'm so trustworthy.
- I'm so nervous.

55:01.592 --> 55:02.760
It's okay.

55:02.844 --> 55:05.096
But you need to be careful
'cause this is a dangerous place.

55:05.179 --> 55:08.349
Okay. Wait, what does that mean?
What does that mean?

55:08.432 --> 55:10.143
What am I getting myself into?

55:10.226 --> 55:12.686
Stand right here. Ready?
And now you're gonna twirl.

55:12.771 --> 55:16.024
- One, two, three.
- This is fun. I like this.

55:16.065 --> 55:17.692
- Okay.
- Okay.

55:19.110 --> 55:20.528
- Are you ready?
- No.

55:21.278 --> 55:22.447
Okay, I'm ready.

55:28.827 --> 55:29.996
Were you prepared?

55:31.831 --> 55:32.874
No.

55:33.750 --> 55:38.588
I was like, what should I get my boy toy
for Valentine's/his birthday.

55:39.172 --> 55:43.677
And I thought, he had it so tough
when he was a kid,

55:44.302 --> 55:48.347
he would dance by himself in a barn
to '80s music.

55:53.853 --> 55:58.441
So maybe he'd like to know
he wasn't by himself anymore.

56:06.240 --> 56:08.117
- This is cool.
- Yeah?

56:09.119 --> 56:10.161
Yeah.

56:12.789 --> 56:13.915
Thanks, Mara.

56:58.126 --> 56:59.919
Can we talk about something?

57:00.670 --> 57:01.921
You're pregnant.

57:02.005 --> 57:03.715
I am. It's triplets.

57:03.797 --> 57:06.133
- My seed is mighty!
- It is.

57:08.762 --> 57:11.014
- Okay. Go on.
- Okay.

57:12.931 --> 57:14.683
What happens after we graduate?

57:15.434 --> 57:18.355
You mean, like, with us?

57:19.021 --> 57:20.148
Yeah.

57:20.940 --> 57:22.733
I actually haven't thought that far ahead.

57:22.817 --> 57:25.362
- I know, it's silly, but...
- I know I want to be with you.

57:27.072 --> 57:28.365
Yeah?

57:29.824 --> 57:31.492
Yeah. I mean...

57:31.576 --> 57:35.579
You're, like, the best thing to come out
of spontaneous combustions for me.

57:35.663 --> 57:38.166
- The very best?
- The very best.

57:38.248 --> 57:39.750
- I love you.
- Fuck!

57:41.335 --> 57:42.920
- You can't say that!
- I'm so sorry!

57:43.003 --> 57:44.588
You can't say that!

57:45.005 --> 57:47.132
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm sorry. I screwed that up.

57:47.217 --> 57:48.843
- Yeah, you did!
- Oh, my God!

57:49.302 --> 57:51.805
- Say it to me later on, okay?
- No.

57:52.722 --> 57:54.182
Okay. Yeah, I'll say it.

58:01.856 --> 58:02.941
Hey.

58:04.608 --> 58:08.822
Maybe this summer,
we can just drive around for a while.

58:10.114 --> 58:11.281
I'd like that.

58:12.909 --> 58:15.412
If we're not fleshy dead bits.

58:15.494 --> 58:17.329
If we're not fleshy dead bits.

58:30.635 --> 58:32.804
Have you heard
of the infinite monkey theorem?

58:32.887 --> 58:35.515
No, but I'm way into how that sounds.

58:36.141 --> 58:40.186
It's the idea of, like,
if you have infinite monkeys

58:40.269 --> 58:42.355
and you give them all infinite typewriters

58:42.438 --> 58:45.733
and an infinite amount of time,
they'll write Shakespeare.

58:46.985 --> 58:48.361
The word "Shakespeare"?

58:48.445 --> 58:50.280
No, like a full play of his.

58:50.362 --> 58:51.947
Sound like pretentious fucking monkeys.

58:52.032 --> 58:54.826
- Stop.
- Can't they write something else?

58:54.909 --> 58:58.204
They'll literally write every book
ever written, because they can't not.

58:59.039 --> 59:00.915
They can't... not.

59:01.666 --> 59:04.169
- I think about this a lot.
- Okay.

59:05.378 --> 59:07.588
I think it helps explain what's happening.

59:08.130 --> 59:10.841
You think monkeys are writing books
that make us explode?

59:10.925 --> 59:13.803
No, the idea that because
you can't say with certainty

59:13.887 --> 59:15.388
that something won't happen,

59:15.472 --> 59:18.141
then eventually it has to happen,
like the Big Bang.

59:19.391 --> 59:22.394
I like my idea about evil monkeys
writing plays better.

59:27.025 --> 59:28.485
This is taking forever, isn't it?

59:31.570 --> 59:33.030
I don't think she's coming.

59:35.532 --> 59:37.493
No one's ever been scared of me before.

59:38.744 --> 59:39.953
Let's go somewhere else.

59:40.038 --> 59:42.331
No. This is where we go.

59:42.414 --> 59:44.541
This is our spot. This is our thing.

59:44.626 --> 59:49.047
I know.
But maybe it's not our thing anymore.

59:57.554 --> 59:58.681
Whatever.

1:00:04.436 --> 1:00:07.940
The last thing I want is for you
to feel like science fair projects.

1:00:08.692 --> 1:00:11.568
Because of your help, the CDC and the FDA

1:00:11.652 --> 1:00:14.113
have been working around the clock
with Washington

1:00:14.197 --> 1:00:19.285
to make the Snooze Button available
over the counter to all Americans.

1:00:19.369 --> 1:00:22.247
So, what is the Snooze Button?

1:00:24.206 --> 1:00:28.002
For starters,
it's not, sadly, a cure, but it is...

1:00:29.628 --> 1:00:30.838
a treatment.

1:00:32.090 --> 1:00:33.341
Give you an example.

1:00:34.050 --> 1:00:35.719
Sometimes you're typing on your computer

1:00:35.802 --> 1:00:39.222
and, out of nowhere,
it turns off, crashes.

1:00:41.349 --> 1:00:43.559
When that happens to us,
we're not so lucky.

1:00:45.394 --> 1:00:46.603
Can I get a volunteer?

1:00:46.688 --> 1:00:47.814
Yeah.

1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:50.692
Steve, great. Come on up.

1:00:55.030 --> 1:00:56.948
Okay. Yes.

1:00:57.699 --> 1:01:00.617
- This is for our bros.
- Yeah!

1:01:00.702 --> 1:01:04.164
Okay. Steve, can I get you
to pat your head, please?

1:01:04.246 --> 1:01:05.289
That's it?

1:01:06.041 --> 1:01:07.083
Can you rub your belly?

1:01:07.625 --> 1:01:08.835
Yeah, come on.

1:01:09.543 --> 1:01:11.003
Okay, stand on one foot.

1:01:12.422 --> 1:01:13.548
Jump up and down.

1:01:16.300 --> 1:01:17.344
This is bullshit.

1:01:24.434 --> 1:01:25.435
Run!

1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:33.485
Mara!

1:01:33.985 --> 1:01:35.737
Come on, get up. Come on.

1:01:45.163 --> 1:01:46.748
- Mara!
- Tess!

1:01:52.878 --> 1:01:53.962
Come on.

1:02:21.032 --> 1:02:22.534
Open the door!

1:02:31.001 --> 1:02:33.378
Mara! Mara!

1:02:33.961 --> 1:02:36.297
Come on. This way is faster.

1:02:36.380 --> 1:02:38.465
- What the fuck is happening?
- They were wrong. They were...

1:02:41.427 --> 1:02:42.429
When you do...

1:03:16.045 --> 1:03:17.422
Mara!

1:03:29.641 --> 1:03:31.935
- Are you okay?
- No.

1:03:32.728 --> 1:03:35.522
- Are you?
- I'm just glad you're still here.

1:04:24.947 --> 1:04:27.574
A fragment of his jawbone hit my forehead.

1:04:31.746 --> 1:04:32.831
I never felt it.

1:04:32.914 --> 1:04:34.874
Mara! Mara!

1:04:38.460 --> 1:04:40.004
I never felt anything.

1:04:40.713 --> 1:04:41.797
Okay.

1:04:42.757 --> 1:04:44.009
Oh, my God.

1:04:45.969 --> 1:04:47.012
Hey.

1:05:13.204 --> 1:05:15.539
All I remember is wanting to die.

1:05:51.076 --> 1:05:52.077
Honey?

1:05:55.163 --> 1:05:56.914
Dylan's mom called for you.

1:05:58.541 --> 1:06:00.794
She just wanted to see how you were doing.

1:06:45.547 --> 1:06:47.132
Mara, can you open the door?

1:06:49.592 --> 1:06:50.677
Please.

1:06:53.554 --> 1:06:56.265
Mara, I just want to make sure
that you're okay.

1:07:07.985 --> 1:07:09.237
Oh, my God.

1:07:14.617 --> 1:07:17.202
All right, you're gonna need vodka...

1:07:18.038 --> 1:07:19.539
dry vermouth,

1:07:19.621 --> 1:07:21.373
grenadine and ice.

1:07:21.833 --> 1:07:24.001
Mix three parts vodka...

1:07:27.963 --> 1:07:30.759
with one part vermouth.

1:07:34.054 --> 1:07:35.472
Fill with ice...

1:07:36.639 --> 1:07:38.016
and stir...

1:07:40.393 --> 1:07:43.646
before pouring into a martini glass.

1:07:45.148 --> 1:07:46.149
Okay.

1:07:46.231 --> 1:07:47.942
And then, with the grenadine,

1:07:48.025 --> 1:07:52.196
you're gonna basically pour the entire
fucking bottle into the martini.

1:07:54.365 --> 1:07:58.036
And now you have my brand-new cocktail
which I've called,

1:07:58.119 --> 1:08:00.914
"All of My Friends
and Boyfriend Are Dead."

1:08:08.420 --> 1:08:10.589
Well, I have a couple of questions.

1:08:11.298 --> 1:08:13.217
Okay, but hold on.

1:08:13.300 --> 1:08:15.219
No, please don't.

1:08:21.309 --> 1:08:23.645
- You can have the next one.
- Okay.

1:08:25.020 --> 1:08:27.606
- I'm not equipped to deal with this.
- I know, right?

1:08:27.690 --> 1:08:31.485
But I've literally found one thing
that makes that feeling go away.

1:08:33.070 --> 1:08:34.447
What is it?

1:08:35.364 --> 1:08:36.782
Alcohol.

1:08:39.327 --> 1:08:42.329
- Why are you whispering?
- 'Cause it's a secret.

1:08:43.122 --> 1:08:45.375
'Cause I'm underage.

1:08:46.417 --> 1:08:48.127
Don't tell anyone, though.

1:09:25.789 --> 1:09:27.000
Tessy!

1:09:28.083 --> 1:09:29.085
Mara.

1:09:29.168 --> 1:09:31.755
Tessy! Let's go fuck shit up.

1:09:32.296 --> 1:09:34.548
- How did you get here?
- I walked, yo.

1:09:35.007 --> 1:09:36.925
- That's, like, ten miles.
- I know.

1:09:37.010 --> 1:09:38.970
I'm fucking Wonder Woman.

1:09:39.429 --> 1:09:40.971
Come on. Let's go do something.

1:09:43.099 --> 1:09:45.685
Let's go throw water balloons
full of red paint at kids.

1:09:45.769 --> 1:09:46.978
Mara.

1:09:47.061 --> 1:09:49.104
No. We have to go to school.

1:09:49.189 --> 1:09:50.481
Fuck school!

1:09:50.564 --> 1:09:52.024
No! I can't fuck school!

1:09:52.524 --> 1:09:54.777
I need to get the fuck out of here!

1:09:54.860 --> 1:09:58.489
And what happened to Dylan, it sucks.
It really fucking sucks. And I'm sorry.

1:09:58.989 --> 1:10:03.411
But people have been dying
for seven fucking months.

1:10:03.494 --> 1:10:06.206
I'm losing my mind. I don't want to die.

1:10:06.288 --> 1:10:07.498
Well...

1:10:08.957 --> 1:10:10.125
then don't die.

1:10:11.043 --> 1:10:12.252
- Easy.
- No.

1:10:12.337 --> 1:10:15.298
- Stop being a bitch. Help me out.
- I can't help you the way you want me to.

1:10:16.256 --> 1:10:17.509
How do I want you to?

1:10:18.217 --> 1:10:21.680
You want to stop existing
until you actually stop existing.

1:10:25.766 --> 1:10:28.228
- What's with the van?
- They don't want us driving anymore.

1:10:29.395 --> 1:10:31.605
Just come hang with me instead.

1:10:32.399 --> 1:10:36.152
If you don't, I'll never get
a beach house with you, ever. Ever.

1:10:36.235 --> 1:10:38.613
As if we're going to live
that long anyway.

1:10:51.042 --> 1:10:52.669
I fucking hate you!

1:11:46.055 --> 1:11:47.097
Fuck.

1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:49.641
Fuck.

1:12:00.819 --> 1:12:02.072
What's up?

1:12:14.501 --> 1:12:16.878
Hey, it's like a metaphor.

1:12:16.961 --> 1:12:18.963
- Mara.
- What?

1:12:19.046 --> 1:12:20.297
Are you gonna arrest me?

1:12:20.381 --> 1:12:22.007
No, I just came by
to see if you needed help.

1:12:22.091 --> 1:12:23.217
Here. Have a drink.

1:12:30.307 --> 1:12:31.850
What the fuck?

1:12:32.769 --> 1:12:34.479
An agent's car?

1:12:34.561 --> 1:12:36.105
It was funny at the time.

1:12:36.189 --> 1:12:38.817
It was funny? What time was it funny?

1:12:38.942 --> 1:12:41.319
- Like, 4:00.
- That's not what I fucking meant.

1:12:41.403 --> 1:12:42.529
No shit, Dad.

1:12:42.612 --> 1:12:45.949
- Are you still drunk?
- One thousand percent.

1:12:46.032 --> 1:12:47.617
Where do you even get alcohol?

1:12:47.701 --> 1:12:49.911
Besides here? I steal it.

1:12:50.994 --> 1:12:52.413
Why would you tell me that?

1:12:52.497 --> 1:12:55.500
'Cause you asked and I'm drunk,
so why would I lie?

1:12:55.582 --> 1:12:57.376
To make us feel better.

1:12:57.793 --> 1:12:59.336
That's all you care about.

1:12:59.421 --> 1:13:01.297
I've heard you call people
about "helping" me.

1:13:01.381 --> 1:13:04.175
We've called them in front of you.
We only care about you.

1:13:04.259 --> 1:13:06.386
Why do you think we're applying
to all these colleges?

1:13:06.469 --> 1:13:08.387
I don't want to go
to any fucking colleges.

1:13:08.470 --> 1:13:10.806
I don't give a fuck what you do
as long as you're alive.

1:13:10.890 --> 1:13:12.934
That is what's gonna make us feel better.

1:13:13.018 --> 1:13:15.520
Yeah? Well, I'm going to die
in a violent explosion full of blood.

1:13:15.603 --> 1:13:17.896
Probably all over you. Feel better?

1:13:26.823 --> 1:13:28.908
Fuck off.

1:16:24.458 --> 1:16:25.585
Tequila?

1:16:27.212 --> 1:16:29.756
What kind of tequila?
No. It's okay. I'm okay.

1:16:38.681 --> 1:16:40.934
Did you just send me
a beach house listing?

1:16:42.810 --> 1:16:43.811
Maybe.

1:16:44.561 --> 1:16:46.230
But we're never gonna be old.

1:16:47.649 --> 1:16:52.278
But we're already really... really old.

1:16:56.615 --> 1:16:57.867
I'm leaving tonight.

1:17:01.203 --> 1:17:02.956
I need my life to start.

1:17:04.164 --> 1:17:06.208
Even if it's just a few minutes long.

1:17:16.176 --> 1:17:17.761
I hope you live forever.

1:17:18.846 --> 1:17:20.305
Like an elf.

1:17:22.100 --> 1:17:23.476
Elves live forever?

1:17:24.728 --> 1:17:27.646
Unless they're murdered or die from grief.

1:17:28.230 --> 1:17:29.523
That's what Dylan said.

1:17:31.984 --> 1:17:33.235
He was a nerd.

1:17:35.654 --> 1:17:37.072
Yeah, he was all right.

1:17:41.118 --> 1:17:42.411
I'll see you inside?

1:17:56.384 --> 1:17:58.052
You'll always be my best friend.

1:19:09.832 --> 1:19:11.208
What the fuck is this?

1:19:12.042 --> 1:19:14.295
It's... It's grad.

1:19:14.378 --> 1:19:15.880
No. It's prom.

1:19:15.963 --> 1:19:17.090
It's both.

1:19:21.845 --> 1:19:24.014
That's fucking stupid.

1:20:08.099 --> 1:20:09.184
Becky Burke.

1:20:17.984 --> 1:20:20.320
I just wanna say I'm sorry
for killing everyone.

1:20:20.403 --> 1:20:23.155
- Okay. Mara, just...
- No. It's cool, man.

1:20:26.408 --> 1:20:28.411
I'm sorry I'm the curse.

1:20:29.203 --> 1:20:30.996
I always have been. I did the math.

1:20:31.081 --> 1:20:34.626
From Katelyn to Perry and the Daltons...

1:20:36.336 --> 1:20:37.545
and Dylan...

1:20:39.506 --> 1:20:41.716
I'm the reason why it happened.

1:20:43.801 --> 1:20:45.177
And I don't know why.

1:20:46.095 --> 1:20:47.596
I'm not a great person.

1:20:50.225 --> 1:20:53.353
And I hate myself so much
for hurting everyone.

1:20:56.480 --> 1:20:57.815
I'm so sorry.

1:21:00.150 --> 1:21:03.654
I wish they were all here
to celebrate this dumb bullshit.

1:21:03.738 --> 1:21:05.657
- Okay. Thank you, Mara.
- Hey.

1:21:05.739 --> 1:21:06.824
Also...

1:21:08.618 --> 1:21:11.037
Springsteen is really good.

1:21:11.746 --> 1:21:13.748
I found that out the hard way.

1:21:22.131 --> 1:21:23.298
Thank you, Mara.

1:21:25.760 --> 1:21:27.177
Claire Hacklon.

1:21:29.096 --> 1:21:30.472
It's all my fault.

1:21:31.765 --> 1:21:33.183
I'm the curse.

1:21:33.893 --> 1:21:36.980
I wasn't a good enough Christian
and now Jesus is punishing me.

1:21:37.063 --> 1:21:39.149
Boo! Sit down, whore!

1:21:42.277 --> 1:21:44.237
No, no! It's my fault!

1:21:44.319 --> 1:21:46.072
I wanted to be top of the class

1:21:46.155 --> 1:21:49.367
and I think I, like,
willed all my competition to die.

1:21:49.451 --> 1:21:51.118
- I'm sorry.
- No. It's okay.

1:21:51.202 --> 1:21:53.246
- I'm sorry.
- No. No, no, no.

1:21:54.247 --> 1:21:56.166
It was me! It was definitely me!

1:21:56.248 --> 1:21:58.251
I used to steal food from the cafeteria!

1:23:16.121 --> 1:23:18.581
I love you too, you know.

1:23:57.203 --> 1:24:01.416
Hi, Dylan's mom.

1:24:02.292 --> 1:24:03.543
Hi, Mara.

1:24:04.293 --> 1:24:05.502
Can I join you?

1:24:30.444 --> 1:24:32.488
I'm sorry I didn't come to the funeral.

1:24:34.490 --> 1:24:35.699
I understand.

1:24:36.993 --> 1:24:38.536
It's a cool headstone, though.

1:24:40.287 --> 1:24:41.455
He designed it.

1:24:42.332 --> 1:24:43.416
Really?

1:24:47.753 --> 1:24:50.215
The first time
Dylan and I ever really hung out...

1:24:51.925 --> 1:24:53.677
I was super sick on shrooms...

1:24:55.511 --> 1:24:57.096
and I saw so many of him.

1:25:00.850 --> 1:25:02.394
And it was beautiful.

1:25:07.981 --> 1:25:10.609
And now I can't even see one of him.

1:25:16.323 --> 1:25:18.617
He told me he held your hair.

1:25:19.993 --> 1:25:21.078
He told you that?

1:25:23.372 --> 1:25:25.750
Did you think I was bad news bears?

1:25:27.543 --> 1:25:28.586
No.

1:25:30.380 --> 1:25:33.591
No, I just...
I thought you were in a lot of pain...

1:25:34.926 --> 1:25:37.012
and didn't know how to deal with it.

1:25:48.439 --> 1:25:50.983
I don't know what to do with my body.

1:25:55.113 --> 1:25:57.282
It feels like I'm dying.

1:26:04.956 --> 1:26:07.167
I'm so scared all the time.

1:26:11.921 --> 1:26:14.923
Sometimes I wish I would just die
so it was over.

1:26:22.349 --> 1:26:24.809
That's just what life
feels like sometimes.

1:26:24.893 --> 1:26:26.935
Life fucking sucks.

1:26:27.645 --> 1:26:29.022
It does.

1:26:29.480 --> 1:26:30.814
It really does.

1:26:33.109 --> 1:26:34.652
Why is this happening?

1:26:40.574 --> 1:26:44.162
Did you hear about the man in Florida
with the sinkhole?

1:26:46.122 --> 1:26:49.209
He was asleep in his bed
and a sinkhole opened.

1:26:49.292 --> 1:26:51.544
His bed fell right down into it.

1:26:52.252 --> 1:26:54.380
His brother heard him
shouting from the next room.

1:26:54.463 --> 1:26:59.551
He ran over and found this giant pit
where the room used to be.

1:27:00.636 --> 1:27:03.472
He could hear his brother
screaming for help,

1:27:03.555 --> 1:27:06.433
but it was impossible to help him.

1:27:07.851 --> 1:27:09.854
They never even got his body out.

1:27:12.189 --> 1:27:13.817
Great.

1:27:13.899 --> 1:27:16.568
Now I have to be afraid of sinkholes too.

1:27:18.947 --> 1:27:20.573
It's just life.

1:27:22.242 --> 1:27:24.284
I'm sure he didn't deserve it.

1:27:26.328 --> 1:27:28.163
None of you deserve this.

1:27:30.833 --> 1:27:33.502
But deserve's got nothing to do with it.

1:27:36.213 --> 1:27:37.548
That's a good line.

1:27:37.631 --> 1:27:40.467
I stole it from Clint Eastwood.

1:27:49.226 --> 1:27:51.061
I think Dylan got it.

1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:55.483
The answer, I mean.

1:28:02.157 --> 1:28:03.408
God.

1:28:04.743 --> 1:28:06.745
What am I supposed to do now?

1:28:11.291 --> 1:28:13.126
Do you want to come over
for dinner next week?

1:28:16.503 --> 1:28:18.340
Yeah, sure.

1:28:19.966 --> 1:28:21.217
Thanks.

1:28:28.725 --> 1:28:30.518
Are you okay?

1:29:37.127 --> 1:29:38.336
I'm sorry.

1:30:47.654 --> 1:30:50.824
After a few months,
there were no more explosions.

1:31:02.462 --> 1:31:05.215
Everyone left and we were free to leave.

1:31:06.507 --> 1:31:09.176
It was super anticlimactic.

1:31:11.470 --> 1:31:14.306
The man was like,
"Hey, the Snooze Button works.

1:31:14.390 --> 1:31:18.519
We just got that last batch wrong.
But we swear this new batch is legit."

1:31:19.561 --> 1:31:22.439
I think they just want to sell me pills
for the rest of my life.

1:31:47.215 --> 1:31:49.050
Are you sure this thing is safe?

1:31:49.134 --> 1:31:50.969
I mean, compared to what?

1:32:07.569 --> 1:32:10.321
Call us every hour. Or even more often.

1:32:10.404 --> 1:32:11.905
Yeah. Call us a lot.

1:32:12.573 --> 1:32:14.283
You know, I actually think I will.

1:32:41.019 --> 1:32:44.481
They're going to tear down the school,
which makes sense.

1:32:48.902 --> 1:32:52.572
They're also going to make a memorial
for the departed, which makes less sense,

1:32:52.654 --> 1:32:55.324
because, let's be honest...

1:32:56.451 --> 1:32:58.619
that sappy shit's gonna suck.

1:33:00.537 --> 1:33:04.750
By the end of the school year,
31 students in the senior class died.

1:33:14.886 --> 1:33:16.096
I didn't die.

1:33:16.970 --> 1:33:18.931
I guess I'll never know why.

1:33:29.317 --> 1:33:31.653
So, what did we learn?

1:33:32.737 --> 1:33:34.197
What did we learn?

1:33:35.407 --> 1:33:38.368
At the end of the day, it's all a...

1:33:40.453 --> 1:33:41.871
Fuck this shit, man.

1:33:41.954 --> 1:33:45.417
The world is a fucking cruel piece of shit
and nothing makes sense,

1:33:45.500 --> 1:33:48.211
and the only thing you can do
is put your middle fingers up

1:33:48.293 --> 1:33:50.337
and be all, like, fuck you, life!

1:33:50.421 --> 1:33:52.089
Suck my dick!

1:33:52.172 --> 1:33:54.550
I'm gonna be amazing
in spite of all life's shit.

1:33:55.135 --> 1:33:58.346
I'm gonna travel the world,
I'm gonna get my bachelors of bullshit,

1:33:58.430 --> 1:34:00.056
I'm gonna write some books

1:34:00.140 --> 1:34:03.476
and make a low-to-minimum wage,
but do really well online.

1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:05.395
I'll probably date some nice boys.

1:34:05.478 --> 1:34:07.021
I'll probably marry a few of them.

1:34:07.104 --> 1:34:10.065
And sometimes, late at night
when the world is quiet...

1:34:10.984 --> 1:34:13.278
I'll tell them about Dylan

1:34:13.360 --> 1:34:15.404
and what he meant to me,

1:34:15.488 --> 1:34:17.657
and how I think about him every day.

1:34:18.908 --> 1:34:22.620
I'll probably have a bunch of kids
and be a dope mom, and then...

1:34:22.703 --> 1:34:25.247
No, you know what? Fuck it.
I'm gonna be president.

1:34:25.331 --> 1:34:26.750
I, Mara Carlyle...

1:34:26.832 --> 1:34:29.793
Trump's gonna look up at me
from his gold-crusted coffin and go,

1:34:29.877 --> 1:34:31.962
"Who the fuck is this bitch?"
And I'll tell him...

1:34:32.046 --> 1:34:34.882
That's President Bitch to you,
motherfucker.

1:34:34.966 --> 1:34:38.636
The Big Bang happened
out of nowhere, for no reason.

1:34:38.720 --> 1:34:42.015
Or maybe God set it all into motion.
Who knows?

1:34:42.097 --> 1:34:44.516
But then, like, the dinosaurs died

1:34:44.600 --> 1:34:47.936
because a meteor hit the Earth
at the exact worst spot imaginable.

1:34:49.355 --> 1:34:50.731
Fuck, man.

1:34:52.149 --> 1:34:54.652
And volcanoes erupt,
and drunk drivers drive,

1:34:54.735 --> 1:34:58.907
and sinkholes collapse,
and sometimes people explode.

1:35:00.074 --> 1:35:03.118
And I guess that just means
bad shit is gonna happen.

1:35:03.203 --> 1:35:04.621
It's inevitable.

1:35:05.204 --> 1:35:06.747
And so, here we are.

1:35:06.831 --> 1:35:09.751
I'm gonna live the life
I want to have right now.

1:35:09.833 --> 1:35:12.921
I'm not gonna waste time waiting for a day
that may never come for me.

1:35:13.630 --> 1:35:14.838
So fuck it.

1:35:14.922 --> 1:35:16.423
I'm gonna stay at the beach house

1:35:16.507 --> 1:35:18.635
and smoke a hookah
with my toes in the sand.

1:35:19.219 --> 1:35:22.346
I don't know what's gonna happen next.
I hope it's cool.

1:35:22.430 --> 1:35:24.891
All I know is I could die any second now.

1:35:24.974 --> 1:35:26.768
Hell, so could you.

1:35:26.850 --> 1:35:29.938
Nothing's fair,
but it's a beautiful world,

1:35:30.020 --> 1:35:32.523
and I'm happy I get to be here.
