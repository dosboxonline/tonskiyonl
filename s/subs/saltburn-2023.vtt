00:59.208 --> 01:01.125
I wasn't in love with him.

01:02.583 --> 01:03.833
<i>I know everyone thought I was.</i>

01:05.833 --> 01:06.833
<i>But I wasn't.</i>

01:08.208 --> 01:10.166
<i>I loved him, of course.</i>

01:12.000 --> 01:14.291
<i>It was impossible
not to love Felix.</i>

01:14.833 --> 01:17.083
<i>And that was part
of the problem.</i>

01:17.083 --> 01:18.666
<i>Everyone loved him.</i>

01:18.666 --> 01:21.375
<i>Everyone wanted to
be around him.</i>

01:21.375 --> 01:22.833
<i>It exhausted him.</i>

01:23.416 --> 01:25.916
<i>People just wouldn't
leave him alone.</i>

01:26.916 --> 01:28.416
<i>Especially the girls.</i>

01:28.416 --> 01:31.083
<i>Christ, the girls!</i>

01:31.083 --> 01:34.083
<i>It was embarrassing, really,
how everyone fawned over him.</i>

01:35.125 --> 01:38.208
<i>I think, honestly, that's why
he liked me so much.</i>

01:39.208 --> 01:40.500
<i>I protected him.</i>

01:41.291 --> 01:42.916
<i>I was honest with him.</i>

01:42.916 --> 01:44.333
<i>I understood him.</i>

01:45.791 --> 01:47.208
<i>I loved him.</i>

01:47.541 --> 01:50.875
<i>I loved him.</i>

01:53.625 --> 01:55.666
But was I "in love" with him?

05:11.833 --> 05:13.125
I'm Michael Gavey.

05:13.666 --> 05:14.750
Oliver.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.500
- Oliver what?
- Oliver Quick.

05:16.500 --> 05:19.083
So you're a Norman no-mates
too, then, Oliver Quick?

05:19.083 --> 05:21.291
Isn't everyone?

05:21.291 --> 05:23.333
- It's only the first night.
- Look around you.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.500
It's just me and you, mate.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.041
And the girl
who's got agoraphobia,

05:29.041 --> 05:31.250
but she's in her room. Obviously.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.708
- What are you reading?
- Er...

05:33.708 --> 05:34.916
I'm reading Maths.

05:35.541 --> 05:36.541
I'm a genius.

05:36.541 --> 05:38.250
I don't even
like Maths, really.

05:38.250 --> 05:40.125
I can just do it. In my head.

05:40.125 --> 05:42.250
Anything. Ask me a sum.

05:42.250 --> 05:44.708
- No, you're okay.
- Oh, come on.

05:44.708 --> 05:46.541
It's... It's not like
I don't believe you.

05:46.541 --> 05:48.291
- Please. Come on.
- No, I believe...

05:48.291 --> 05:50.333
Fucking ask me a sum, then!

05:52.666 --> 05:53.833
Er...

05:54.708 --> 05:57.458
423 times 78.

05:57.916 --> 05:59.666
32,994.

06:09.291 --> 06:11.375
<i>So, how are you
finding Oxford?</i>

06:12.250 --> 06:13.250
Good.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.708
Yeah, good.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.791
- Hmm.
- Thanks.

06:16.875 --> 06:19.125
Did you come
from far from home?

06:20.541 --> 06:21.541
Prescot.

06:22.208 --> 06:24.125
- Yeah, where?
- Er, Prescot.

06:25.625 --> 06:27.208
- Merseyside.
- Ah.

06:27.708 --> 06:28.708
Never been.

06:29.541 --> 06:31.041
Never been.

06:33.958 --> 06:34.958
Prescot.

06:37.000 --> 06:39.208
So, how did you get on
with the summer reading list?

06:39.208 --> 06:41.750
Er, yeah. Okay, I think.

06:41.750 --> 06:42.916
I read it all.

06:43.416 --> 06:44.791
- What, all of it?
- Mmm-hmm.

06:44.791 --> 06:46.833
Fifty books on there.
Are you mad?

06:46.833 --> 06:48.833
- I thought we're supposed to.
- King James Bible is on there.

06:48.833 --> 06:50.333
Telling me you
spent your whole summer

06:50.333 --> 06:51.416
reading the Bible?

06:51.416 --> 06:53.083
The reading list is optional.

06:53.083 --> 06:55.541
I've not read
half the books on there.

06:55.541 --> 06:57.166
- Sorry.

06:59.500 --> 07:02.583
Any idea where he's got to?
He's 20 minutes late now.

07:03.250 --> 07:04.791
Right, well, I suppose we'd
better make a start, then.

07:05.875 --> 07:09.083
I'm so sorry. Sorry I'm late.
Sorry I'm late.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.458
I'm so sorry.

07:10.458 --> 07:11.750
Got completely lost.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.291
Hi. Nice to meet you.
I'm sorry.

07:13.291 --> 07:17.416
You're Farleigh Start,
I take it?

07:17.416 --> 07:19.041
Nice of you to join us, finally.

07:19.875 --> 07:22.250
You're not a
relation of, er,

07:22.250 --> 07:23.916
Frederica Start,
by any chance?

07:23.916 --> 07:25.291
Er, she's my mother.

07:25.291 --> 07:26.375
No!

07:27.208 --> 07:28.500
I knew her
when I was your age.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.041
When we were both here.

07:30.041 --> 07:32.791
When she was Frederica Catton.
Before she went to America.

07:32.791 --> 07:34.041
No way!

07:34.041 --> 07:36.500
Oh, my God. I'll tell her.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.750
She's gonna be thrilled
that I'm being

07:37.750 --> 07:39.333
tutored by one of her friends.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.791
Oh, no, not, er, friend.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.250
More, er... admirer.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.083
Yeah, from afar.

07:47.916 --> 07:50.333
Not sure we ever spoke.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.666
No, don't even mention me.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.250
Shall we start?

07:58.458 --> 08:00.708
"G.K. Chesterton
would have it.

08:00.708 --> 08:02.875
"This outrageous
gallop of lines.

08:03.541 --> 08:04.541
"And thus,

08:04.541 --> 08:06.000
-"the shape of the verse...

08:06.000 --> 08:07.833
"...can be said like
Browning's <i>Last Duchess</i>

08:07.833 --> 08:10.125
"to look as if
it 'were alive'."

08:11.916 --> 08:13.916
- Okay. Yeah.

08:13.916 --> 08:15.583
Very good. Erm...

08:16.666 --> 08:21.416
Yeah, a lot of food
for thought there. Intriguing.

08:21.416 --> 08:23.083
And thus...

08:25.208 --> 08:26.208
Hmm?

08:26.541 --> 08:28.666
Sorry. Er, just "thus".

08:28.666 --> 08:29.833
It's just a funny word.

08:30.833 --> 08:32.208
- Why?
I don't know.

08:32.208 --> 08:34.791
I don't think we really use it
in real life, do we?

08:34.791 --> 08:37.708
It's just, kind of, verbose,
don't you think?

08:37.708 --> 08:39.708
- No. Not really.
- No.

08:40.708 --> 08:42.541
No, you don't.
You used it seven times.

08:42.541 --> 08:44.250
- No, I didn't.
-  Yes, you did.

08:44.250 --> 08:45.541
I counted.

08:46.958 --> 08:48.333
He's got you there,
I'm afraid, Oliver.

08:48.833 --> 08:51.000
So, you're picking apart
the style of my essay

08:51.000 --> 08:52.750
instead of the substance?

08:52.750 --> 08:54.708
That's kind of...

08:54.708 --> 08:56.083
- Kind of what?
- Lazy?

08:56.083 --> 08:57.958
It's completely
valid to debate

08:57.958 --> 08:59.291
the rhetoric of an argument.

08:59.291 --> 09:00.958
It's not what you argue
but how.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.625
Great point.
Yeah.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.125
Especially if you haven't
actually read the poems.

09:05.958 --> 09:07.416
Look forward
to hearing your essay.

09:37.541 --> 09:38.583
Oliver.

09:39.125 --> 09:40.208
Oliver?

09:40.791 --> 09:42.000
I got you a Crunchie.

09:43.708 --> 09:44.750
Oh, thanks.

09:46.208 --> 09:47.208
Did you know

09:47.208 --> 09:49.208
there was a college
Christmas party tonight?

09:51.041 --> 09:53.291
NFI, me and you.

09:53.291 --> 09:55.208
Not fucking invited.

09:55.916 --> 09:58.250
- I'm sure anyone can go.
- Oh, no.

09:58.250 --> 09:59.833
It's invitation only, apparently.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.166
You get an invite
in your pigeon hole?

10:01.166 --> 10:03.875
- Haven't checked.
- I have. You didn't.

10:03.875 --> 10:06.083
Fucking losers.

10:06.083 --> 10:08.125
- Like we wanted to go, anyway.
- Yeah.

10:08.125 --> 10:10.250
As if we actually want to talk
to those vapid cunts.

10:10.250 --> 10:12.583
- Nah, we can make our own fun,

10:12.583 --> 10:14.625
- can't we?
- Yeah.

10:14.625 --> 10:16.625
- Are you gonna eat that?
- No, you can have it.

Yeah, of course,
it's when I'm already

11:08.416 --> 11:10.208
ten minutes late
for my tutorial.

11:10.208 --> 11:11.750
Fuck!

11:11.750 --> 11:12.833
Where is it?

11:12.833 --> 11:14.625
Er, it's Iffley Road.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.791
- Shit.
- Yeah.

11:16.791 --> 11:18.875
I'm already in it
for skiving last week, so...

11:26.333 --> 11:28.541
Look, I'm not really
going anywhere.

11:28.541 --> 11:30.958
Just taking these
back to the library.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.291
Take my bike.

11:35.208 --> 11:37.416
No, no, no, I couldn't.
I mean, it looks like rain.

11:37.416 --> 11:39.958
- I wouldn't want to...
- Honestly, it's no big deal.

11:39.958 --> 11:42.083
I mean, I'll just get it
from you later.

11:42.083 --> 11:44.291
- You're in my college, so...
- Am I?

11:45.583 --> 11:46.625
Yep.

11:47.750 --> 11:49.500
Fuck, that's kind.
Are you serious?

11:50.875 --> 11:52.375
Mate, that is so kind.
Thank you.

11:52.375 --> 11:53.458
Are you sure?

11:53.458 --> 11:55.375
I mean, it's a bit of a faff
wheeling it back to college.

11:56.166 --> 11:58.041
You want me
to take yours back?

11:58.041 --> 12:00.666
Oh, no, no, no. I...
I'm sorry, I just thought...

12:00.666 --> 12:02.708
I mean, I can wheel it
back to college.

12:02.708 --> 12:05.083
- It's not that far.
- Oh, thank you.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.583
Thank you. I'm sorry,
I don't know your name.

12:06.583 --> 12:08.416
- I'm... I'm Felix.
- Oliver.

12:08.416 --> 12:09.833
- Oliver. Oliver.
- Yeah.

12:09.833 --> 12:11.291
- Oliver, I love you.

12:11.291 --> 12:12.916
- I love...
- Yeah...

12:12.916 --> 12:14.166
I love you.

12:14.166 --> 12:15.416
I love you. I love you. Seriously.

12:15.416 --> 12:17.083
- Okay.
- Thank you so much, mate.

12:17.083 --> 12:20.416
So kind. You're a fucking
life-saver, really. Thank you.

12:20.416 --> 12:22.750
All right, I'll just leave
yours in the bike shed, yeah?

12:22.750 --> 12:24.666
- Yeah. Fine.
- All right, cheers, Ollie!

12:34.500 --> 12:36.916
Jameson spends the whole time
staring at her tits,

12:36.916 --> 12:38.375
completely ignoring the fact

12:38.375 --> 12:41.000
she can barely
do her times tables.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.291
Times tables, Oliver!

12:42.291 --> 12:44.500
Just fuck off
and do history of art, love.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.333
- Hmm.
- Oliver. Oliver?

12:47.125 --> 12:49.291
- Yeah.
- Not exactly dazzling company.

12:50.375 --> 12:51.375
Sorry.

12:55.583 --> 12:57.458
Ooh! Sweet baby Jesus!

12:57.458 --> 12:58.541
I'm going for a slash.

12:58.541 --> 13:00.000
Get me another pint,
please, Oliver?

13:00.708 --> 13:01.750
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

13:06.458 --> 13:08.041
- A pint, mate.
Yeah.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.583
Oh! There he is.
Ollie! Oliver!

13:11.583 --> 13:13.083
Oliver! Come here, mate!

13:13.083 --> 13:14.166
Yeah, come here.

13:14.875 --> 13:16.791
Come here. What? Come here.

13:18.125 --> 13:19.125
Unreal.

13:20.041 --> 13:21.166
Hiya, mate.

13:21.750 --> 13:22.750
Hi.

13:22.750 --> 13:25.000
This is my fucking hero
right here.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.083
I was just telling everyone

13:26.083 --> 13:27.208
how you saved
my arse yesterday.

13:27.208 --> 13:29.083
So cute.
So cute.

13:29.083 --> 13:30.458
Hey, take a seat.
I owe you a drink.

13:30.458 --> 13:31.750
Here, shove up, yeah.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.208
Oh, sorry.
Are you with a friend?

13:35.083 --> 13:37.333
Er, no, they just left.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.166
So, erm, what college
are you in, mate?

13:43.666 --> 13:44.750
- Yours.
Oh, right.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.125
And, er,
what are you studying?

13:49.208 --> 13:51.458
Shots. Shots. Shots.

14:06.416 --> 14:08.083
Wait, wait, wait, Jägerbombs.

14:08.083 --> 14:10.166
Jägerbombs!

14:10.666 --> 14:12.291
- I...
- It's your round, man.

14:12.291 --> 14:14.000
Yeah, go on, mate.
- I should go to bed.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.750
Wait, no, no, no.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.708
No, you can't snake your way
out of a round.

14:18.208 --> 14:20.666
- I'm... I'm not.
- It looks like you are.

14:24.333 --> 14:25.333
Come on.

14:28.000 --> 14:29.208
Okay! Okay.

14:32.541 --> 14:33.750
- Farleigh.
What?

14:33.750 --> 14:35.791
- Just cut him a break, mate.
- What?

14:35.791 --> 14:38.041
That round's gonna cost
a fucking fortune.

14:38.041 --> 14:39.416
Pub rules, Felix.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.500
It's my round.
I can't.

14:42.625 --> 14:44.750
I can't. I can't go back
and ask them for money.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.166
Not my problem.
I'm asking...

14:47.125 --> 14:48.541
Could I just pay you tomorrow?

14:48.541 --> 14:50.208
I'm sorry, mate.
You're not even close.

14:50.208 --> 14:52.833
Oh, please, I'll bring you
the money tomorrow.

14:52.833 --> 14:54.125
No.

14:54.125 --> 14:56.041
- Please? I'm...
Fuck's sake.

14:56.041 --> 14:58.333
Thought you might need a hand
with these ones, mate.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.750
Oh, and you, er,
you dropped this

14:59.750 --> 15:01.166
on the floor by your feet.

15:02.541 --> 15:03.541
I was gonna nick it,

15:03.541 --> 15:05.000
but I thought
I'd do the right thing.

15:11.458 --> 15:12.458
Thank you.

15:13.625 --> 15:16.250
I'll, erm,
pay it back tomorrow.

15:19.125 --> 15:20.458
Don't know what
you're talking about, mate.

15:20.958 --> 15:23.166
Thank you, Ollie!
Whoa!

15:23.166 --> 15:26.333
- Thank you, Ollie. Oh, my God.

15:26.333 --> 15:27.583
Cheers, man.

15:27.583 --> 15:30.166
Ollie! Ollie! Ollie!

16:09.625 --> 16:10.625
<i>Yeah, well, you know,</i>

16:10.625 --> 16:12.000
<i>Farleigh basically
grew up with us.</i>

16:12.000 --> 16:13.916
<i>I didn't know
you and Farleigh were cousins.</i>

16:13.916 --> 16:15.666
Mmm. My aunt,

16:15.666 --> 16:17.291
- Farleigh's mum...
- Mmm-hmm.

16:17.291 --> 16:19.333
...ran away to America
when she was 19

16:19.333 --> 16:21.250
to escape
the cold-hearted English.

16:22.833 --> 16:24.791
- Ciggie?
- Er, don't smoke.

16:25.583 --> 16:27.333
<i>Dear Auntie Fred
married a lunatic</i>

16:27.333 --> 16:28.791
<i>who pissed everything
she had up the wall</i>

16:28.791 --> 16:31.208
and a fair chunk
of Dad's money too,

16:31.208 --> 16:33.875
until he had to finally
cut her off.

16:33.875 --> 16:36.000
Sounds like
an Evelyn Waugh novel.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.333
You know,
a lot of Waugh's characters

16:37.333 --> 16:38.625
are based on
my family, actually.

16:38.625 --> 16:41.458
Yeah, he was completely
obsessed with our house.

16:42.041 --> 16:43.041
Well, Dad, you know,

16:43.041 --> 16:45.291
<i>he felt so guilty
about the whole thing that</i>

16:45.291 --> 16:47.666
<i>he decided he would pay for
all of Farleigh's education.</i>

16:47.666 --> 16:49.375
Lucky Farleigh.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.291
<i>Oh, fat lot of good
it's done him.</i>

16:51.291 --> 16:53.208
<i>He's been expelled from almost
every school in England</i>

16:53.208 --> 16:54.416
for sucking off the teachers.

16:56.541 --> 16:58.083
<i>How about you?</i>
OLIVER<i>: Er...</i>

16:58.083 --> 16:59.791
I've not sucked
any teachers off.

16:59.791 --> 17:01.125
Not yet, you haven't.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.958
It's DJ Fucking Shadow.

17:03.958 --> 17:05.750
He's fucking
chronic, mate.

17:05.750 --> 17:07.875
All these
boarding school psychos.

17:07.875 --> 17:09.250
What do they teach you?

17:09.250 --> 17:11.750
Um, Latin.

17:11.750 --> 17:13.333
Water polo.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.000
- And child abuse.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.083
Ah, that's cute.

17:18.500 --> 17:19.625
Baby Felix.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.750
There aren't any pictures
of me as a kid.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.583
<i>Well, I mean, there's not much
really to say.</i>

17:25.583 --> 17:26.958
Oh, come on.
What, are you

17:26.958 --> 17:28.541
in fucking witness protection
or something?

17:28.541 --> 17:29.625
Jesus Christ, mate.

17:29.625 --> 17:32.166
<i>Well, do you
have any siblings?</i>

17:32.166 --> 17:33.250
<i>What are your parents like?</i>

17:33.250 --> 17:34.791
Siblings, no.

17:35.833 --> 17:38.250
And, er, my parents, I...

17:38.250 --> 17:39.541
What?

17:39.541 --> 17:41.083
...don't see them that much.

17:41.083 --> 17:43.541
- Why?
- Just, er...

17:43.541 --> 17:45.250
<i>they've...</i>

17:45.250 --> 17:47.458
- They've got problems.
- What? What kind of...

17:47.458 --> 17:49.833
- What do you mean, problems?
- Mental health.

17:49.833 --> 17:51.416
<i>And addiction and stuff.</i>

17:51.416 --> 17:53.750
Dad was, kind of,
dealing and stuff.

17:53.750 --> 17:55.083
Dealing?

17:55.083 --> 17:57.000
Sounds awful, really.

17:58.083 --> 17:59.625
- Yeah.
- Was it, was it...

17:59.625 --> 18:01.416
- Was it awful?
- Look, it's...

18:01.916 --> 18:03.208
...it's all tough.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Yeah.

18:05.500 --> 18:06.500
Fuck 'em.

18:10.958 --> 18:12.375
You're a fucking
inspiration, mate.

18:12.375 --> 18:13.666
Seriously.

18:13.666 --> 18:14.916
Thank you.
Very cool.

18:17.958 --> 18:20.583
Now, can you eenie, meenie
India or Annabel,

18:20.583 --> 18:23.750
and take one fucking home?
Because they look miserable.

18:23.750 --> 18:26.000
Eenie, meenie, miny, moe.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.541
Catch a tiger by his toe.

18:27.541 --> 18:29.333
If he squeals, let him go.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.333
Er...

18:32.333 --> 18:33.625
You're out, boy scout.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.083
Well, what the fuck, mate?

18:43.083 --> 18:45.000
I've been chirpsing her
for about an hour.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.583
I wanted at least a handjob.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.166
I know. We all want
a fucking handjob, mate.

18:49.166 --> 18:51.750
Get yourself a title
and a massive fuck off castle.

18:56.375 --> 18:57.541
Oliver Quick.

19:01.166 --> 19:02.291
You look different.

19:04.125 --> 19:05.125
Do I?

19:07.875 --> 19:09.291
He'll get bored of you.

19:10.958 --> 19:11.958
Excuse me?

19:16.666 --> 19:17.833
Bootlicker.

19:25.083 --> 19:26.583
Can Oliver come?
Maybe.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.666
What?

19:27.666 --> 19:30.375
I don't know.
He's just a bit awkward.

19:30.916 --> 19:31.916
He's got zero chat.

19:31.916 --> 19:34.458
Like, who would I even
sit him next to?

19:35.000 --> 19:36.458
I don't know.
One of your hot friends?

19:38.958 --> 19:40.416
I'm... I'm sorry, Felix,

19:40.416 --> 19:43.250
but no one wants to sit
next to fucking Oliver.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.333
Why not?

19:44.333 --> 19:46.708
'Cause
he's a scholarship boy

19:46.708 --> 19:49.166
who buys his clothes
from Oxfam.

19:49.833 --> 19:52.958
Harsh. That's so harsh.

19:52.958 --> 19:54.750
- You're such a snob.
Sorry.

20:35.708 --> 20:37.958
- So fucking hot.

20:40.375 --> 20:41.458
I know.

20:44.250 --> 20:45.458
What's that smell?

20:49.125 --> 20:50.833
Erm... I don't know.

20:53.458 --> 20:54.625
No.

20:54.625 --> 20:56.500
- No, no, no.
- What? What are you on about?

20:56.500 --> 20:57.958
It's disgusting, Felix.

20:57.958 --> 20:59.666
- Right, I'm cleaning up.
- It's fine.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.375
Only rich people can afford
to be this filthy.

21:02.375 --> 21:03.666
- Fuck off.
- I mean, you've got

21:03.666 --> 21:04.750
fucking pizza on the floor.

21:04.750 --> 21:05.833
Mate, stop it.
I'll do it later. It's fine.

21:05.833 --> 21:08.416
No, you won't, mate.
No, you fucking won't.

21:09.208 --> 21:11.416
- You'll never do it.
- Yes, I will.

21:11.416 --> 21:13.083
- No, you won't.
- Ollie, yes, I will.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.208
- I said I'd do it later.
- No, you won't.

21:14.208 --> 21:16.208
Ollie, fucking stop!
I'm not a fucking child!

21:16.208 --> 21:17.375
I can do it myself!

21:24.458 --> 21:25.875
I'm just... I'm just...

21:26.583 --> 21:28.708
I'm just hot. It's fucking
boiling in these rooms.

21:28.708 --> 21:30.458
They'd rather we all
die of heatstroke

21:30.458 --> 21:32.333
than ruin the fucking
wood fucking panelling

21:32.333 --> 21:33.750
by putting in
air conditioning.

21:34.500 --> 21:35.625
Stressing about the exams?

21:35.625 --> 21:37.250
I'm not stressed
about the exams, Ol.

21:37.250 --> 21:38.916
You're driving me fucking...

21:48.291 --> 21:51.291
I've got some revising to do.
I think I might, er...

21:51.291 --> 21:52.708
I might catch you later, yeah?

21:55.416 --> 21:57.916
- King's Arms later?
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe. Erm...

21:57.916 --> 21:59.375
I'll text you, yeah?

22:02.500 --> 22:03.500
Okay.

22:03.500 --> 22:04.583
Of course.

I was just seeing
if Felix was in.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.500
We were supposed to meet.

23:21.500 --> 23:22.916
Er...

23:24.250 --> 23:25.625
Yeah, they're all at the pub.

23:26.291 --> 23:27.875
Oh.

23:27.875 --> 23:29.291
Okay.

23:29.291 --> 23:30.458
He didn't say.

23:32.208 --> 23:33.250
Was India there?

23:34.333 --> 23:35.333
Yeah.

23:38.458 --> 23:41.125
- Sorry.
-  Oh, God, no.

23:41.125 --> 23:42.208
Whatever.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.416
Do you have any alcohol?

23:53.875 --> 23:55.583
Would you like me
to have alcohol?

24:09.916 --> 24:12.625
Do you think
he'll be jealous?

24:14.541 --> 24:15.541
Honestly?

24:17.083 --> 24:19.458
I don't think it will even
fucking register.

24:51.791 --> 24:52.958
Hi, Mum.

25:02.291 --> 25:03.500
Ollie, what's happened?

25:08.041 --> 25:10.458
- Hey, come here.

25:13.125 --> 25:14.166
How did it happen?

25:15.541 --> 25:17.083
Cracked his head
on the pavement.

25:19.333 --> 25:22.041
Probably drunk, knowing Dad.

25:22.541 --> 25:25.166
-  Fucking hell.
- Or off his fucking tits.

25:26.041 --> 25:27.333
Jeez, I'm...

25:28.125 --> 25:30.000
I'm so sorry, Ollie, that's...

25:30.000 --> 25:31.125
It's just a shock.

25:32.875 --> 25:33.958
Is your mum all right?

25:34.833 --> 25:36.958
She was completely incoherent...

25:38.500 --> 25:41.458
which is pretty
normal for her.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.458
They're gonna
have to let you skip exams.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.250
You're in no state
to do them now.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.750
- I mean, you've gotta go home.
- No.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.166
I can't miss the exams.

25:49.166 --> 25:50.250
Of course you can miss

25:50.250 --> 25:52.083
- the fucking exams.
- No, I can't.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.458
No.

25:53.458 --> 25:55.125
I'm not like you, Felix.

25:56.208 --> 25:57.458
This is all I have.

26:28.125 --> 26:29.458
- Hey, Oliver.
- Hey.

26:31.625 --> 26:34.833
Oh, nice tux.

26:34.833 --> 26:35.916
Thank you.

26:35.916 --> 26:38.375
Wow. It's a rental, right?

26:38.375 --> 26:39.458
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

26:40.791 --> 26:42.333
Yeah, the sleeves
are too long.

26:43.625 --> 26:45.875
Always check the sleeves.

26:47.875 --> 26:48.916
But still, not bad.

26:50.041 --> 26:51.708
I mean, you're almost passing.

26:52.291 --> 26:53.291
For what?

26:54.250 --> 26:55.250
I don't know.

26:55.916 --> 26:57.541
A real human boy.

27:01.041 --> 27:02.083
Hey.

27:02.083 --> 27:03.166
Ollie!

27:04.291 --> 27:05.500
- Hiya, mate.
- Hey.

27:05.500 --> 27:06.875
Come on, then. Follow me.

27:08.041 --> 27:10.041
Wait, wait, wait.

27:10.708 --> 27:12.791
- Where are we going?

27:12.791 --> 27:14.500
We're gonna
miss the ball, Felix.

27:19.833 --> 27:21.250
What's going on, Felix?

27:21.750 --> 27:23.458
Well, I was thinking
about how I...

27:32.041 --> 27:35.291
You... You've had such
a shit time lately

27:35.291 --> 27:36.916
and you've been so brave
about everything, I...

27:36.916 --> 27:39.958
- Oh, Felix, come on.

27:39.958 --> 27:42.833
So in my family,
we have this tradition, right?

27:42.833 --> 27:43.916
When somebody dies,

27:43.916 --> 27:47.000
we write their name on a, er,
on a stone,

27:47.000 --> 27:48.541
and we chuck it in the river.

27:48.541 --> 27:50.166
My great-grandfather
started it

27:50.166 --> 27:51.583
when his son died in the war.

27:51.583 --> 27:54.125
I've only done it
for my dog so far, but...

27:55.125 --> 27:56.875
You know,
I don't know, I just...

27:56.875 --> 27:58.208
It helped, a bit.

28:02.458 --> 28:04.625
This feels a bit
fucking stupid now.

28:04.625 --> 28:06.625
No. It's not stupid.

28:07.833 --> 28:08.875
Thank you.

28:09.916 --> 28:11.083
It's something, right?

28:19.541 --> 28:21.125
- So what do I do?
- I don't know really.

28:21.125 --> 28:24.000
Erm, er, I guess you could say
a few words, or...

28:24.958 --> 28:27.750
I mean, we could just stand
here in silence for a bit.

28:27.750 --> 28:30.333
And then you just...
just chuck it in.

28:51.166 --> 28:53.000
- Well, that can't be good.
- Oh.

28:54.875 --> 28:55.875
Fuck.

29:01.291 --> 29:02.541
Do you think you'll go home?

29:05.291 --> 29:06.333
Honestly?

29:08.000 --> 29:10.041
I don't think
I'll ever go home again.

29:10.541 --> 29:11.708
But what
about your mum?

29:16.750 --> 29:18.000
You know
the first time I felt

29:18.000 --> 29:19.541
the inside of my mum's throat?

29:21.250 --> 29:22.250
I was eight.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
My dad told me

29:26.000 --> 29:28.458
I had to stick my fingers in
to make her sick,

29:29.791 --> 29:31.041
otherwise...

29:32.500 --> 29:33.833
she'd die in her sleep.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.333
So "home" doesn't mean
the same for me

29:39.333 --> 29:41.291
as it does for you, Felix.

29:42.875 --> 29:44.833
The fucking
filth of the place,

29:44.833 --> 29:46.625
the mess, I can't do it.

29:48.708 --> 29:49.750
Just can't.

29:54.708 --> 29:56.500
Well, why don't you
come home with me?

29:56.500 --> 29:58.041
Come to Saltburn.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.208
- No.
- Yeah.

30:00.208 --> 30:01.541
It's too much
of an imposition.

30:01.541 --> 30:03.583
Oh, fuck off, it is!
You'll save my sanity.

30:03.583 --> 30:05.041
-  Seriously.
- Oh, it'd feel weird.

30:05.041 --> 30:06.750
It won't feel weird.
I mean, Mum has people

30:06.750 --> 30:08.541
come and stay
for months at a time.

30:09.541 --> 30:10.875
And you know what?
If you get sick of us,

30:10.875 --> 30:12.208
you can leave.

30:13.958 --> 30:15.083
I promise.

30:17.458 --> 30:19.291
<i>And I believed him.</i>

30:25.958 --> 30:27.083
Saltburn.

31:30.333 --> 31:31.333
Mr Quick.

31:32.333 --> 31:33.333
You're early.

31:33.333 --> 31:35.625
Er, I got the earlier train.

31:36.375 --> 31:37.875
Well, do let
us know next time.

31:37.875 --> 31:40.208
You see,
the gates were not open.

31:41.000 --> 31:42.166
That's... That's okay.

31:42.166 --> 31:44.291
We'd sent someone
to pick you up.

31:45.291 --> 31:46.291
Ah.

31:46.875 --> 31:48.291
- Sorry.
- Not at all.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.333
Follow me.

32:06.208 --> 32:07.291
Wow.

32:08.916 --> 32:10.125
This is amazing.

32:13.041 --> 32:14.500
Wow. Wow.

32:14.500 --> 32:16.250
- Just wow.
- Hmm.

32:18.916 --> 32:20.500
Just leave your bag there.

32:20.500 --> 32:21.916
Someone will get it for you.

32:21.916 --> 32:24.833
Ollie!
Thank God you're here.

32:24.833 --> 32:26.416
Duncan, I'll show him
to his room. Don't worry.

32:26.416 --> 32:29.041
Oliver, try not to be
too terrified of Duncan.

32:29.041 --> 32:30.916
Duncan, stop being
so frightening

32:30.916 --> 32:32.041
in front of my friends.

32:32.041 --> 32:33.791
- Well, I'll try. Felix.
Come on, mate.

32:33.791 --> 32:35.875
- Come on.
- He is terrifying.

32:35.875 --> 32:37.833
Oh, he's all right.
He's just odd.

32:38.708 --> 32:39.708
Okay!

32:39.708 --> 32:41.916
So...

32:42.791 --> 32:45.291
Er, red staircase.

32:45.916 --> 32:48.041
I accidentally
fingered my cousin here.

32:50.000 --> 32:52.250
Henry VII's cabinet.

32:52.916 --> 32:54.208
Ghost of Granny.

32:54.208 --> 32:55.291
Hi, Granny.

32:56.500 --> 32:58.250
Green room. Gardens.

32:58.250 --> 33:00.875
Some fucking hideous Rubens.

33:01.375 --> 33:02.750
Broken piano.

33:03.291 --> 33:05.625
Er, blue room.

33:05.625 --> 33:06.708
It's blue.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.500
And King's bedroom.

33:11.500 --> 33:12.875
Actually, the bed still has

33:12.875 --> 33:14.583
some of Henry VIII's
spunk on it.

33:15.583 --> 33:17.083
This is the long gallery.

33:17.083 --> 33:20.291
Er, dead reli. Dead relies.

33:20.291 --> 33:21.833
Daddy's old teddy.

33:21.833 --> 33:24.041
Shakespeare's folio.

33:24.041 --> 33:25.125
And maze.

33:25.625 --> 33:26.916
So, yeah,
we're just through here.

33:27.416 --> 33:28.541
Okay.

33:29.166 --> 33:30.750
Er, my room.

33:31.250 --> 33:32.791
You'll be staying
just next door.

33:34.541 --> 33:35.791
Bathroom.

33:36.416 --> 33:38.083
Ooh, by the way, we're gonna
be sharing a bathroom.

33:38.083 --> 33:39.166
I hope you don't mind.

33:39.166 --> 33:41.416
Otherwise you'd be miles away
on the other end of the house.

33:43.208 --> 33:44.291
Dressing room.

33:46.041 --> 33:47.375
And...

33:49.125 --> 33:50.291
your room!

33:51.875 --> 33:52.916
Wow.

33:55.625 --> 33:56.750
I'm glad you're here, mate.

33:58.750 --> 34:01.583
Right, I will, er...
I will leave you to it.

34:02.250 --> 34:03.250
Er, just one thing.

34:03.250 --> 34:06.000
Mum has a phobia
of, er, beards and stubble,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.291
so I left a razor for you
in the bathroom.

34:08.291 --> 34:09.541
- What?
- Yeah. I don't know.

34:09.541 --> 34:11.000
She thinks it's unhygienic.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.416
Er, something to do
with her father.

34:12.416 --> 34:13.500
It's bonkers. I mean...

34:13.500 --> 34:15.625
I'm not even allowed to wear
my fucking stud when I'm here.

34:16.666 --> 34:18.250
Anything else
I should know about?

34:18.250 --> 34:20.125
No. No, just be yourself.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.333
They'll love you.
It's relaxed, I promise.

34:22.833 --> 34:23.833
We'll be in the library.

34:25.333 --> 34:26.375
Library?

34:41.125 --> 34:42.791
<i>McLovin's never existed
'cause that's a made-up</i>

34:42.791 --> 34:44.708
<i>dumb fucking fairy-tale name,
you fuck!</i>

34:46.708 --> 34:49.375
But they might have,
sort of, meetings, I suppose.

34:49.375 --> 34:51.708
Well, I mean, they probably
don't have rehab in Liverpool.

34:51.708 --> 34:53.458
No, gosh, no.
No, I can't imagine they do.

34:53.458 --> 34:55.583
No, see, everybody just
goes to ruin, I suppose.

34:55.583 --> 34:56.666
Where is Liverpool?

34:56.666 --> 34:57.833
I think
it's on the sea, isn't it?

34:57.833 --> 34:59.166
Darling, where's Liverpool?

35:00.083 --> 35:01.916
Er, north.

35:01.916 --> 35:03.125
- North.
Yes.

35:03.125 --> 35:05.208
It's called Prescot.

35:05.208 --> 35:07.458
Oh,
it'll be some awful slum.

35:07.458 --> 35:10.583
Mmm.
A sort of hellish squat.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.625
And both his parents
were dealing.

35:12.625 --> 35:14.750
God, and his mother's a drunk.

35:14.750 --> 35:16.416
I mean, babies
can be really affected.

35:16.416 --> 35:19.041
- Traumatised.
- Oh, they come out drunk.

35:19.041 --> 35:20.208
Is that right,
that he had to put his fingers

35:20.208 --> 35:22.125
down his mother's throat
to make her sick?

35:22.125 --> 35:23.541
Farleigh,
that's private stuff.

35:23.541 --> 35:25.875
Well, you told us.
In confidence.

35:25.875 --> 35:27.041
It's awful, darling.

35:27.041 --> 35:28.291
Can you imagine
doing that to me?

35:28.291 --> 35:29.375
I think
that's actually

35:29.375 --> 35:30.541
rather normal
when you're poor.

35:30.541 --> 35:31.625
I think, when you're poor,

35:31.625 --> 35:33.208
that sort of thing
does happen a little bit more.

35:33.208 --> 35:34.291
We should give him

35:34.291 --> 35:35.375
the most wonderful time.

35:35.375 --> 35:37.291
Good luck,
he doesn't smile much.

35:37.291 --> 35:38.750
Farleigh seems
to think he's ghastly.

35:38.750 --> 35:40.041
Why are you friends
with him, darling?

35:40.041 --> 35:41.166
Dirt poor, not attractive

35:41.166 --> 35:42.250
and his parents
are drug addicts.

35:42.250 --> 35:45.000
- I can't actually...
- And here he is now!

35:45.000 --> 35:46.166
We were just
talking about you.

35:46.166 --> 35:47.250
Don't be silly.

35:48.083 --> 35:50.333
Farleigh, you just make up
the most awful things.

35:50.333 --> 35:51.500
Of course we weren't.

35:51.500 --> 35:52.958
Hello, Oliver, darling.

35:54.375 --> 35:56.625
Oh, what beautiful eyes.

35:56.625 --> 35:58.500
Oh, how wonderful!

35:58.500 --> 35:59.708
Yeah, I told you
he wasn't a minger.

35:59.708 --> 36:02.208
Oh, but, darling,
you're kind about everyone.

36:02.208 --> 36:03.500
You can't be trusted.

36:03.500 --> 36:07.416
Oliver, I have a complete
and utter horror of ugliness.

36:07.416 --> 36:09.541
Ever since I was very young.
I don't know why.

36:09.541 --> 36:11.083
Maybe because
you're a terrible person?

36:11.083 --> 36:12.625
- Don't be mean.

36:13.416 --> 36:15.333
Has Venetia seen you yet?

36:15.333 --> 36:17.166
Oh, my God, she'll die.

36:17.791 --> 36:20.333
She's been draping herself
all around the house all day

36:20.333 --> 36:21.583
hoping you'll come across her.

36:21.583 --> 36:23.708
-  As it were.
- Do stop.

36:23.708 --> 36:25.125
The poor boy's
only just arrived.

36:25.125 --> 36:27.833
Oliver, how good
to finally meet you.

36:27.833 --> 36:29.875
- Trip all right?
- Yes, thank you, sir.

36:29.875 --> 36:31.333
Oh, God,
don't with the "sirs".

36:31.333 --> 36:33.833
No, no, no, we can't stand
anything like that here.

36:33.833 --> 36:35.083
Go on, come and sit by me.

36:36.208 --> 36:37.583
This is my
dear friend, Pamela,

36:37.583 --> 36:38.750
who's been staying with us.

36:38.750 --> 36:40.000
Hey.

36:41.625 --> 36:43.041
Pamela, darling,
will you go and find Annie

36:43.041 --> 36:44.333
and ask about tea?

36:46.791 --> 36:47.791
Yeah.

36:48.666 --> 36:50.625
Yeah. Who, which...
Which one's that?

36:50.625 --> 36:51.916
You'll find her, darling. Annie.

36:54.458 --> 36:55.750
Where's, erm...
- You'll work it out, darling.

36:55.750 --> 36:56.833
Okay, I'm going
to work it out.

36:56.833 --> 36:58.458
Kitchen.
Ah, the kitchen.

36:58.458 --> 36:59.875
Kitchen.
So, Annie in the kitchen.

36:59.875 --> 37:00.958
Annie in the kitchen.

37:02.333 --> 37:03.375
Off you pop.
- Okay.

37:04.500 --> 37:06.458
Poor Dear Pamela.
She's been staying with us

37:06.458 --> 37:07.541
while she gets
back on her feet.

37:07.541 --> 37:10.000
She's had an awful time
this year. Hideous.

37:10.000 --> 37:13.166
But, oh, Oliver, so have you.

37:13.166 --> 37:15.625
God, I was so sorry
to hear about your father.

37:15.625 --> 37:17.458
How utterly, utterly tragic.

37:18.625 --> 37:20.583
I've lost so many friends
to addiction.

37:20.583 --> 37:23.083
So, so many dear,
dear friends.

37:23.083 --> 37:25.750
It's the root of Poor Pamela's
horrors too, I'm afraid.

37:25.750 --> 37:27.916
And the only interesting
thing about her.

37:27.916 --> 37:29.291
Farleigh!

37:29.291 --> 37:30.625
No, she is rather dull, actually.

37:30.625 --> 37:31.791
But she's so beautiful.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.833
You have to admit,
she's very beautiful.

37:33.833 --> 37:35.333
But it's only ever
really been a curse.

37:35.333 --> 37:37.750
I mean, the men. Oliver,
you wouldn't believe it.

37:37.750 --> 37:40.541
The latest one is some
ghastly Russian billionaire.

37:40.541 --> 37:41.958
Malignantly ugly, of course.

37:41.958 --> 37:45.416
And she's been holed up here
for months hiding from him.

37:45.416 --> 37:47.833
Anyway,
let's not talk about that.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.708
Darling, tell me
about your mother.

37:49.708 --> 37:51.250
How is she bearing up?

37:52.375 --> 37:53.708
- Still drinking?
- Stop!

37:53.708 --> 37:55.541
- Ignore him.
- It's rude.

37:55.541 --> 37:56.708
Nothing shocks me, Oliver.

37:57.416 --> 37:58.708
Absolutely nothing.

37:58.708 --> 37:59.791
Tell me everything.

38:05.875 --> 38:07.166
Fucking hell.

38:18.416 --> 38:19.500
God, Ollie, I'm sorry

38:19.500 --> 38:21.166
Mum asked
so many rude questions.

38:21.166 --> 38:23.000
Don't take it personally.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.875
Someone unpacked my suitcase?

38:24.875 --> 38:27.875
Er... Shit, yes.
I should have told you.

38:27.875 --> 38:29.708
They do that here.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.458
The maids all report
back to Mum, by the way,

38:31.458 --> 38:33.958
so I hope you didn't pack
anything scandalous.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.833
Just my old boxers.

38:37.833 --> 38:39.875
-  God.
- Oh, no, they're used to that.

38:39.875 --> 38:40.958
Don't worry.

38:41.833 --> 38:43.041
Duncan will be thrilled.

38:45.875 --> 38:47.958
Oh, erm...
I hope you don't mind.

38:47.958 --> 38:50.083
I had them hang up
an old school dinner jacket.

38:50.083 --> 38:51.250
We, er...

38:51.250 --> 38:52.333
We dress for dinner here,

38:52.333 --> 38:54.541
so I didn't want you
to be caught short.

38:54.541 --> 38:55.791
Dress for dinner?

38:55.791 --> 38:58.666
Yeah, it's, like...
It's, like, black tie.

38:59.583 --> 39:01.666
- I could've brought one.
- Oh, no, don't be silly.

39:01.666 --> 39:03.416
I mean, I have a spare.
It'd be a waste.

39:04.791 --> 39:05.958
Do you have cufflinks, though?

39:07.208 --> 39:08.208
No.

39:08.208 --> 39:10.375
That's all right.
We'll get it sorted. I'll...

39:10.375 --> 39:12.000
I'll get you some.

39:14.250 --> 39:16.208
I'm really happy
you're here, Ol.

39:16.208 --> 39:18.791
I'm sorry that
everything is so...

39:18.791 --> 39:20.666
old-fashioned.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.000
No, it's wonderful.

39:33.625 --> 39:35.458
We met in rehab, so...

39:35.458 --> 39:37.750
He was just so lovely
at first, and then

39:37.750 --> 39:38.958
all of his business partners

39:38.958 --> 39:40.916
started, sort of,
falling out of windows.

39:42.083 --> 39:43.625
-  You know.
- Right.

39:43.625 --> 39:46.833
- Lucky escape.
Mmm. I suppose so.

39:46.833 --> 39:48.291
But he spoke Russian
all the time

39:48.291 --> 39:50.000
and it just sounded
so romantic.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.000
And I don't know
the Russian word for "whore",

39:52.000 --> 39:55.041
so I, sort of, thought
it sounded like lovely poetry.

39:55.041 --> 39:56.125
Yeah.

39:56.958 --> 39:59.250
Daddy always said I'd end up
at the bottom of the Thames.

39:59.250 --> 40:00.750
So far so good.

40:00.750 --> 40:02.875
I don't know
what I'd do without Elspeth.

40:02.875 --> 40:04.000
She really saved me.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.458
Don't bang on about it,
Pamela, darling.

40:05.458 --> 40:07.166
You know we're delighted
to have you for however long

40:07.166 --> 40:09.708
- it is you mean to stay.
- Forever?

40:09.708 --> 40:12.000
Oh, no. I think I might have,
erm, found somewhere.

40:12.000 --> 40:13.583
- Oh, well done, darling.
- Oh, good.

40:13.583 --> 40:15.250
Yeah, my cousin...
My cousin has a flat.

40:15.250 --> 40:17.375
Oh, that'll suit you
very well, a nice little flat.

40:17.375 --> 40:19.416
It's more of a...
More of a bedsit really.

40:19.416 --> 40:21.291
I loved living
in a bedsit in my 20s.

40:21.291 --> 40:24.041
It's so freeing
to live all in one room.

40:24.041 --> 40:25.875
And much less cleaning to do.

40:25.875 --> 40:28.041
Oh, but it'll be terrible
when you're gone.

40:28.041 --> 40:29.208
How will I cope?

40:29.208 --> 40:30.291
Well, I...

40:30.291 --> 40:31.500
I could actually stay
for a little bit longer...

40:31.500 --> 40:33.625
Oh, no, darling, no.

40:33.625 --> 40:35.541
You must be desperate
to be rid of us

40:35.541 --> 40:38.125
and find your own place.
I quite understand.

41:12.541 --> 41:13.541
Hey.

41:13.541 --> 41:15.416
Fucking hell,
you gave me a fright.

41:16.125 --> 41:19.333
Sorry. I just thought
you were sleepwalking.

41:20.333 --> 41:22.083
No, I wanted to have a look
at the moon.

41:26.791 --> 41:27.958
It's nearly full.

41:28.458 --> 41:29.541
Do you know what that means?

41:30.875 --> 41:31.875
No.

41:32.958 --> 41:35.125
We're all about
to lose our minds.

41:39.125 --> 41:41.708
Sorry, you must be...
You must be cold.

41:45.541 --> 41:47.000
I'm cold-blooded.

41:48.541 --> 41:50.750
We're all cold-blooded,
haven't you noticed?

41:53.500 --> 41:54.666
You're not cold-blooded.

41:56.375 --> 41:58.000
Your family is so kind to me.

41:59.833 --> 42:02.125
- Sweet.

42:05.333 --> 42:08.083
I see why Felix
likes you so much.

42:10.333 --> 42:11.625
You're so, erm...

42:12.250 --> 42:13.375
So what?

42:16.708 --> 42:17.708
I don't know.

42:25.041 --> 42:26.041
Real.

42:27.041 --> 42:28.166
- Hmm.

42:31.041 --> 42:33.500
I think I like you even more
than last year's one.

42:38.458 --> 42:39.625
Night.

42:46.458 --> 42:48.208
- What's, erm, what's...
Breakfast is ready.

42:49.833 --> 42:51.208
Morning.
- Morning.

42:53.041 --> 42:54.083
Morning.

42:54.083 --> 42:55.166
You sleep well, mate?

42:55.166 --> 42:57.125
Erm, yeah.

43:02.625 --> 43:03.625
Hi.

43:04.541 --> 43:06.125
Hey, Oliver,
have some breakfast.

43:06.125 --> 43:09.041
Er, can I get a full
English breakfast too, please?

43:12.166 --> 43:14.125
Breakfast is on the side, darling.

43:14.125 --> 43:15.375
Just help yourself.

43:15.875 --> 43:17.333
How would you like your eggs?

43:17.333 --> 43:19.916
- It's fine. I can get them.
Not the eggs.

43:20.541 --> 43:23.416
The eggs are made for you.

43:23.416 --> 43:24.500
Exactly.

43:25.166 --> 43:26.500
And everything else
is on the side.

43:33.708 --> 43:35.333
Fried over easy, please.

43:38.166 --> 43:40.291
Ollie, we were just talking
about the Shelley biography.

43:40.291 --> 43:42.416
Shelley who? Shelley,
Belinda's sister Shelley?

43:42.416 --> 43:45.166
Oh, Percy Bysshe Shelley.
The poet.

43:46.041 --> 43:48.250
- The Romantic poet.
- Oh.

43:48.250 --> 43:50.958
Do you know the story
about Shelley's doppelgänger?

43:50.958 --> 43:53.250
His doppelgänger?
Mmm.

43:53.250 --> 43:55.375
Shelley's housekeeper
was cleaning one of the rooms

43:55.375 --> 43:58.875
when Shelley walked past
the window and waved at her.

43:59.625 --> 44:01.916
So, she waved back
before she realised

44:01.916 --> 44:03.541
that Shelley was in Italy.

44:03.541 --> 44:04.833
And she was on the top floor
of the house.

44:04.833 --> 44:07.541
Oh, Vee. Stop, stop, stop.
I won't sleep.

44:07.541 --> 44:09.083
A few hours later, he drowned.

44:09.625 --> 44:10.625
Oh!

44:11.250 --> 44:13.250
Oh, that's just
given me goosebumps.

44:13.250 --> 44:15.375
- Look, Pamela.
- Oh, no.

44:15.375 --> 44:17.583
- I heard he fucked his sister.
- Oh, for God's sake!

44:17.583 --> 44:19.166
I think that was Byron.

44:19.166 --> 44:20.875
Oh,
speaking of which...

44:21.583 --> 44:25.166
Ellie, did you hear,
Ada ran off with Tommy Prior?

44:25.166 --> 44:26.458
Yes, you told me.
-  Thank you so much.

44:26.458 --> 44:28.500
'Course she did.
Her husband was ghastly.

44:40.291 --> 44:41.541
Is everything okay, Ollie?

44:41.541 --> 44:44.083
Er, 'course, yeah.
It's just, erm...

44:44.875 --> 44:46.416
Runny eggs. I...

44:47.791 --> 44:49.208
I get a bit sick from them.

44:55.250 --> 44:56.291
Sorry.

44:58.041 --> 44:59.083
So sorry.

44:59.083 --> 45:01.083
Sorry.

45:11.333 --> 45:12.666
We're over here, Ollie!

45:16.625 --> 45:18.125
Hi, mate.
Hey.

45:18.833 --> 45:21.041
No trunks allowed
in the field.

45:30.875 --> 45:32.500
Well, well, well.

45:33.291 --> 45:35.291
- Leave him alone.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.083
Good for you.

45:38.541 --> 45:39.958
- What a twist.

47:47.791 --> 47:48.833
Quite all right.

47:50.083 --> 47:52.375
Lots of people get lost
in Saltburn.

47:54.666 --> 47:56.083
- Well...

49:22.500 --> 49:23.791
All right.

49:24.625 --> 49:25.875
Night, mate.

50:18.208 --> 50:19.625
Oh, Oliver darling.

50:21.250 --> 50:22.833
So punctual.

50:22.833 --> 50:25.125
Poor Vee.
The boys just run a mile.

50:25.125 --> 50:26.208
Why?

50:26.208 --> 50:27.541
Well, she gives
it away for free.

50:27.541 --> 50:31.500
She's sexually incontinent.
Has been since she was 14.

50:31.500 --> 50:35.083
My mother always said...
"Born masochist."

50:35.083 --> 50:36.875
And then there's all the stuff
with the food.

50:36.875 --> 50:38.208
What stuff?

50:38.208 --> 50:39.958
You know,
"fingers for pudding".

50:41.291 --> 50:43.125
We thought she'd grow
out of it, the throwing up.

50:44.041 --> 50:45.583
I... I didn't know.

50:45.583 --> 50:46.958
Well, exactly!
Hasn't even helped.

50:46.958 --> 50:48.125
Complete waste of time.

50:48.125 --> 50:51.208
Honestly. But if she found
the right boy or girl.

50:51.208 --> 50:53.166
I don't care. Anything.

50:54.125 --> 50:56.125
I was a lesbian for a while,
you know.

50:56.125 --> 50:57.625
But it was all just
too wet for me in the end.

50:57.625 --> 50:59.375
Men are so lovely and dry.

51:01.458 --> 51:03.625
Ah, it can't have been
easy for Venetia.

51:04.583 --> 51:06.166
With you being her mother.

51:06.166 --> 51:07.958
- Why?
- Because...

51:07.958 --> 51:09.041
Because what?

51:09.708 --> 51:11.583
Because you're
so fucking beautiful.

51:24.041 --> 51:26.375
What do you think, er, Pamela
will be wearing tonight?

51:26.375 --> 51:28.791
What? Oh, Pamela's not here.

51:28.791 --> 51:30.625
- Oh, is she...
- She's gone.

51:30.625 --> 51:32.958
James thought it would better
to peel her away this morning

51:32.958 --> 51:35.125
without too much of a scene.

51:35.125 --> 51:36.875
Only so many hints
you can drop.

51:36.875 --> 51:38.708
Yeah, she did seem a bit lost.

51:38.708 --> 51:41.625
Ha, very tactful.
She's a complete limpet.

51:41.625 --> 51:43.083
The wettest of wet blankets.

51:43.083 --> 51:44.500
And very hard to know
from looking at her

51:44.500 --> 51:45.958
because she's so stylish.

51:45.958 --> 51:47.375
You'd think she was a riot
to look at her.

51:47.375 --> 51:49.708
But there's absolutely nothing
going on underneath.

51:52.166 --> 51:53.291
I know she's
had a hideous time

51:53.291 --> 51:54.625
the past few years
but, honestly,

51:54.625 --> 51:56.125
she did go on about it.

51:58.041 --> 51:59.708
If all of it was true...

52:02.666 --> 52:03.666
What do you mean?

52:07.416 --> 52:08.541
I shouldn't have said that.

52:10.208 --> 52:11.375
No, no, go on.

52:13.750 --> 52:16.000
No, I don't know. Just...

52:17.208 --> 52:20.500
Her stories, they just seemed
a bit inconsistent at times.

52:23.000 --> 52:24.208
I thought you noticed it too.

52:24.208 --> 52:26.500
Oh, yes, I had. Absolutely.

52:27.500 --> 52:28.750
The self-pity,

52:29.916 --> 52:31.666
the emotional blackmail.

52:33.666 --> 52:34.708
You know.

52:35.166 --> 52:36.208
Yes.

52:36.208 --> 52:38.500
Yes! God!

52:38.500 --> 52:40.291
I was feeling quite guilty
about it this afternoon,

52:40.291 --> 52:41.541
but you're absolutely right.

52:41.541 --> 52:44.083
There was actually something
quite sinister about her.

52:44.916 --> 52:45.958
Yes.

52:46.833 --> 52:48.333
Thank goodness
for you, Oliver.

52:48.333 --> 52:49.750
You're so perceptive.

53:34.791 --> 53:36.125
You're presumptuous.

53:38.250 --> 53:40.541
And you're in
a see-through nightdress

53:40.541 --> 53:42.041
underneath my window.

53:42.916 --> 53:45.458
It's my house.
I can go wherever I want.

53:46.416 --> 53:47.875
Oh, okay.

53:49.500 --> 53:52.333
And you want to be
in a see-through nightdress

53:52.333 --> 53:53.750
underneath my window.

53:58.041 --> 53:59.583
I hadn't really
thought about it.

54:01.250 --> 54:02.583
Just a masochist, then?

54:12.458 --> 54:14.041
You're not eating anything.

54:17.625 --> 54:18.708
Yes, I am.

54:20.041 --> 54:21.833
Well, you're not
keeping it down.

54:24.041 --> 54:26.625
I mean, you're so beautiful, Venetia.

54:28.166 --> 54:30.000
You need to look
after yourself.

54:32.375 --> 54:35.791
So tomorrow
you're going to eat,

54:36.791 --> 54:40.125
and then you're going
to stay at the table.

54:44.833 --> 54:46.250
Do you understand?

54:50.458 --> 54:51.500
Yes.

54:52.708 --> 54:53.708
Good.

55:22.250 --> 55:23.708
I could just eat you.

55:33.791 --> 55:35.166
Ollie...

55:35.166 --> 55:38.375
It's... It's not the right
time of the month.

55:38.375 --> 55:40.958
And is that something
you think I'm worried about?

55:50.250 --> 55:52.166
It's lucky for you
I'm a vampire.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.541
You've got a little
something there.

57:27.916 --> 57:30.416
You stupid little boy.

57:57.125 --> 57:58.416
It must have been
such a strain.

57:59.208 --> 58:00.208
I can never

58:00.208 --> 58:01.333
remember the name
of the, er, chubby one.

58:01.333 --> 58:02.416
What was it?

58:02.416 --> 58:03.666
He's some doctor in Paris.

58:03.666 --> 58:04.750
I can't remember his name.

58:04.750 --> 58:05.958
But he gives you,
sort of, shakes

58:05.958 --> 58:08.375
that you mix up with water,
I suppose.

58:09.500 --> 58:11.166
Good morning.
Hello, darling.

58:11.166 --> 58:13.541
- You sleep well?
- No, not really, mate.

58:13.541 --> 58:15.666
We're 30 for dinner
tomorrow night.

58:15.666 --> 58:17.500
Stopford Sackville
has cried off.

58:17.500 --> 58:18.583
Oh, dear, that's a shame.

58:18.583 --> 58:20.416
God, I forgot about
fucking dinner.

58:20.416 --> 58:22.333
Wait, who is coming
to dinner again?

58:22.333 --> 58:24.458
- The Henrys.
No, please!

58:24.458 --> 58:26.333
- Who are the Henrys?
Dad's friends.

58:26.875 --> 58:28.083
They're all called Henry.

58:28.083 --> 58:30.791
- Not all of them. Just most.
- It'll be fun.

58:30.791 --> 58:32.583
It'll be being
molested by Henry.

58:33.250 --> 58:34.250
You know which one.

58:34.250 --> 58:35.458
I'll put you next
to Oliver, then.

58:35.458 --> 58:36.916
He can molest you instead.

58:41.166 --> 58:42.750
Oh, Oliver,
I was going to say,

58:42.750 --> 58:44.458
we should do something fun
for your birthday.

58:45.041 --> 58:46.083
A proper party.

58:46.541 --> 58:48.750
No Henrys.
Something actually fun.

58:49.500 --> 58:50.833
What do you think, darling?

58:50.833 --> 58:53.416
If Oliver would like it,
I think it's a splendid idea.

58:53.416 --> 58:55.000
I think Oliver
looks like he'd rather

58:55.000 --> 58:56.458
throw himself out of a window.

58:59.250 --> 59:00.416
What kind of party?

59:00.416 --> 59:01.791
I don't know.
Whatever you want.

59:01.791 --> 59:04.333
What do you think?
About 100 people?

59:04.333 --> 59:05.583
- A hundred?
- Or two.

59:05.583 --> 59:06.916
It invariably
ends up being two,

59:06.916 --> 59:08.541
doesn't it, with this
sort of thing?

59:09.083 --> 59:12.166
Invite whoever you want.
All your friends.

59:12.166 --> 59:13.833
What friends?

59:15.208 --> 59:17.916
Oh! Oh! How about fancy dress?

59:17.916 --> 59:19.333
Oh, yes!

59:19.333 --> 59:21.625
I can wear
my suit of armour, Elspeth.

59:21.625 --> 59:22.750
Good idea, darling.

59:27.000 --> 59:28.250
We could have a theme.

59:28.250 --> 59:29.583
What about
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream?</i>

59:29.583 --> 59:30.666
Lovely.

59:30.666 --> 59:32.541
Bring on the slutty fairies.

01:00:03.291 --> 01:00:04.333
Hey.

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:12.541
Hey.

01:00:13.083 --> 01:00:14.291
Felix.

01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:16.541
Is everything okay?

01:00:16.541 --> 01:00:18.500
Yes. Why?

01:00:19.833 --> 01:00:21.833
You seem annoyed
about something.

01:00:21.833 --> 01:00:23.291
I'm not annoyed
about anything.

01:00:23.291 --> 01:00:24.375
Okay.

01:00:27.125 --> 01:00:29.041
It's just slightly bad form,
that's all.

01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:31.125
- What's bad form?
- What do you think?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.375
Getting with Venetia, Ollie.

01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:37.000
What makes you think
I got with Venetia?

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.500
Farleigh saw you two.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:39.791
It's just
fucking cringe, mate.

01:00:39.791 --> 01:00:41.041
I mean, really,
you're my friend.

01:00:41.041 --> 01:00:42.208
You're supposed
to be here with me.

01:00:42.208 --> 01:00:44.208
Look, I didn't want
to embarrass Venetia.

01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:46.791
What do you mean?

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:49.916
Well, I saw her...
I saw her outside

01:00:49.916 --> 01:00:51.666
and I went down to see
was she okay.

01:00:51.666 --> 01:00:55.458
And I think she got the wrong
end of the stick because...

01:00:55.458 --> 01:00:57.166
she tried to kiss me.

01:00:57.166 --> 01:00:59.000
And I politely
steered her away.

01:00:59.916 --> 01:01:02.208
Farleigh said you two were
practically eating each other.

01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:03.666
Oh, and you believe him?

01:01:04.333 --> 01:01:05.916
Me and Venetia?

01:01:05.916 --> 01:01:07.416
Come on.

01:01:13.958 --> 01:01:15.875
- Well, why didn't you tell me?
- I just...

01:01:16.875 --> 01:01:18.416
I thought it would
be nicer not to.

01:01:19.166 --> 01:01:21.375
She was hammered.
Probably doesn't remember.

01:01:23.958 --> 01:01:25.500
She's so embarrassing.

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:27.500
And fucking Farleigh.
What a little a shit stirrer.

01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:29.416
Mmm.

01:01:29.416 --> 01:01:31.250
Well, someone
has to entertain us all.

01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:32.416
Right.

01:01:34.666 --> 01:01:36.041
That's why we love him.

01:01:38.916 --> 01:01:40.916
Thank God.

01:01:40.916 --> 01:01:43.041
You know, I thought we had
another Eddie situation.

01:01:44.291 --> 01:01:45.291
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

01:01:45.291 --> 01:01:46.833
Eddie was my best friend
at school.

01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:48.083
And he came to stay with us.

01:01:48.083 --> 01:01:50.333
And he, kind of,

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:53.583
developed a little thing
for Venetia,

01:01:53.583 --> 01:01:56.166
and everything just
got so awkward.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.125
Yeah, it, kind of,
ruined our friendship.

01:02:05.458 --> 01:02:06.541
I can imagine.

01:02:40.208 --> 01:02:41.500
I'm not saying
my mother isn't

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:42.916
completely idiotic
when it comes to money.

01:02:42.916 --> 01:02:44.166
You just have
to be firm with her.

01:02:44.166 --> 01:02:46.000
I can't call her
and tell her no.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.708
I know. I know.
You've said that.

01:02:47.708 --> 01:02:49.250
- I know, I understand.
No, you don't.

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.958
- You don't. It's humiliating.
It's very hard...

01:02:50.958 --> 01:02:52.625
I'm sorry,
but it's a bit fucking shitty.

01:02:52.625 --> 01:02:54.500
You're all throwing Oliver
a party for 200 people

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:56.125
while my mother
lives in squalor.

01:02:56.125 --> 01:02:57.875
Oh, she's hardly
living in squalor, mate.

01:02:57.875 --> 01:02:59.875
Well, she can't
pay her bills, so she will be.

01:02:59.875 --> 01:03:01.958
Okay? At the rate she's going,
she will be.

01:03:01.958 --> 01:03:03.250
Right,
that's exactly why

01:03:03.250 --> 01:03:04.625
Dad's concerned
about helping her.

01:03:04.625 --> 01:03:05.875
He doesn't wanna enable her.

01:03:05.875 --> 01:03:07.708
He wants her to learn
to stand on her own two feet.

01:03:07.708 --> 01:03:09.416
- Yeah, like he does?
- Farleigh.

01:03:09.416 --> 01:03:12.375
I mean, you do know
how this looks, right?

01:03:13.916 --> 01:03:16.458
Making me come to you
with a begging bowl.

01:03:16.458 --> 01:03:17.666
What are you implying?

01:03:17.666 --> 01:03:19.791
I think you know
what I'm implying, Felix.

01:03:21.458 --> 01:03:23.250
Why don't you ask
Liam and Joshua?

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:24.375
Who...

01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:26.000
Who the fuck
are Liam and Joshua?

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.083
Your footmen.

01:03:33.916 --> 01:03:36.291
Oh, that is...

01:03:37.291 --> 01:03:38.666
That is low, Farleigh.

01:03:38.666 --> 01:03:39.875
- Jesus Christ, mate.
- Okay.

01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:41.333
Seriously, is that...
Is that where

01:03:41.333 --> 01:03:42.750
- you wanna take this?
- Right.

01:03:42.750 --> 01:03:43.958
Make it a race thing?

01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:47.250
What the fuck?
I mean, we're your family.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:49.166
We hardly even notice
that you're different,

01:03:49.166 --> 01:03:50.250
or anything like that.

01:03:50.250 --> 01:03:51.500
Mmm.
- I never know

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.958
our footmen's names.

01:03:52.958 --> 01:03:54.791
The turnover of a footman
is notoriously high.

01:03:54.791 --> 01:03:56.583
- Of course.
- And by the way,

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:58.041
my father has been
more generous

01:03:58.041 --> 01:03:59.416
than most people would be.

01:04:00.333 --> 01:04:01.375
A lot more.

01:04:06.958 --> 01:04:08.083
But...

01:04:09.875 --> 01:04:12.500
maybe... maybe we've done
all that we can.

01:04:39.750 --> 01:04:41.416
How do you know
her father, then?

01:04:44.208 --> 01:04:46.041
Felix warned you off, then?

01:04:49.583 --> 01:04:52.166
Well, maybe we just need to be
a bit more careful.

01:04:54.041 --> 01:04:55.125
No, thanks.

01:04:57.833 --> 01:05:00.500
It's just so disappointing.

01:05:01.625 --> 01:05:03.291
You're just another
one of his toys.

01:05:06.833 --> 01:05:07.833
You're upset.

01:05:07.833 --> 01:05:10.375
Oh, don't worry.
I'm used to it. Honestly.

01:05:11.541 --> 01:05:13.250
I mean, he never liked
sharing his toys.

01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:19.291
Even the ones he doesn't want
to play with any more.

01:05:21.166 --> 01:05:23.250
Henry, how is your
gorgeous son?

01:05:25.166 --> 01:05:27.750
Venetia, Venetia...

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:30.291
- Me first. You're on my left.
- I'm sorry.

01:05:30.291 --> 01:05:31.375
Of course.

01:05:32.666 --> 01:05:34.958
So, how long have you
known the Cattons for?

01:05:34.958 --> 01:05:37.375
Oh, forever. Forever and ever.

01:05:37.375 --> 01:05:40.583
- And how... how did you...
- My husband is James' godson.

01:05:40.583 --> 01:05:41.750
How long have
you been married?

01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:42.875
You've been married long?

01:05:42.875 --> 01:05:44.208
Yes.

01:05:44.208 --> 01:05:46.416
- Lovely.
- Why?

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:49.750
- Erm...
- Why would it be "lovely"?

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:51.583
- Hmm?
- The man's an idiot.

01:05:51.583 --> 01:05:52.791
...from the ocean floor.

01:05:52.791 --> 01:05:54.291
Do you know what I mean?

01:05:55.291 --> 01:05:57.583
- Have you got children?
- Yes. Two.

01:05:57.583 --> 01:06:00.041
No, three. Three boys.

01:06:00.041 --> 01:06:02.041
- Must be a handful.
- Well, no, they're at school.

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:03.166
That's the main thing
about school,

01:06:03.166 --> 01:06:04.375
you hardly ever have
to see them.

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:08.041
Hen, darling, save me.

01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:10.750
The rumour was,
she had two arseholes.

01:06:10.750 --> 01:06:13.083
How was I supposed to know
she was a bloody hooker?

Henry VII or Henry VIII?

01:07:02.625 --> 01:07:04.541
You know,
I think I'd fuck Richard III.

01:07:06.083 --> 01:07:09.125
He's so insecure, so you know
he'd put in the work, right?

01:07:13.833 --> 01:07:15.291
Or you could just fuck me?

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:25.250
Why did you tell Felix
about me and Venetia?

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:27.791
Well, I didn't think
he'd react that badly.

01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:29.375
Yes, you did.

01:07:29.916 --> 01:07:30.916
Yes, I did.

01:07:34.166 --> 01:07:35.916
You know...

01:07:36.833 --> 01:07:38.500
if you ever wanna
talk to anyone,

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.375
you can talk to me, Farleigh.

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:44.750
What do you mean?

01:07:44.750 --> 01:07:47.708
Well, I know you're going
through a hard time at home.

01:07:48.708 --> 01:07:50.041
I know how that feels.

01:07:52.208 --> 01:07:54.000
When things are so precarious.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.083
It's terrifying.

01:08:00.208 --> 01:08:01.291
And lonely.

01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:04.333
And it must be
so fucking weird

01:08:04.333 --> 01:08:06.250
having to ask them
for everything.

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:08.625
And I know
you fucking hate me.

01:08:08.625 --> 01:08:09.708
I...

01:08:10.416 --> 01:08:11.500
I don't hate you.

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.291
But if you ever wanted me

01:08:13.291 --> 01:08:15.166
to talk to them
to see if there's...

01:08:16.791 --> 01:08:19.833
If I can help in any way...

01:08:21.125 --> 01:08:22.125
...just ask.

01:08:29.375 --> 01:08:31.375
- Okay.

01:08:32.166 --> 01:08:34.875
Right, I think I'm gonna go
put him out of his misery.

- I don't even know the song.

01:09:07.083 --> 01:09:08.291
The words are
on the screen, Oliver.

01:09:08.291 --> 01:09:10.583

Farleigh.
- What?

01:10:05.833 --> 01:10:07.166
This is your song as well, Farleigh.

01:10:07.166 --> 01:10:08.291
Come finish it.

01:10:10.083 --> 01:10:11.666

What do you
think I'm doing?

01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:52.208
I think you're
in the wrong fucking room.

01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:57.666
Am I?

01:11:06.250 --> 01:11:09.125
Are you going to
behave from now on, Farleigh?

01:11:09.125 --> 01:11:10.250
No.

01:11:23.583 --> 01:11:25.041
Are you going to behave?

01:11:28.583 --> 01:11:29.875
No.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.750
Don't make me ask again.

01:11:47.375 --> 01:11:48.500
Say it.

01:11:52.416 --> 01:11:53.750
I'm going to behave.

01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:00.541
- What the fuck...

01:12:46.208 --> 01:12:47.750
I wouldn't do this.
James is very upset.

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:49.375
You know that...
Why would I do this?

01:12:49.375 --> 01:12:50.541
I don't know...
I swear to God,

01:12:50.541 --> 01:12:52.083
- this has to be...
Enough!

01:12:52.083 --> 01:12:53.291
There must be
some kind of mistake here.

01:12:53.291 --> 01:12:54.375
Farleigh...
- I'm sure I can...

01:12:54.375 --> 01:12:55.833
Vee, what the fuck
is going on?

01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:57.833
It's Farleigh.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:12:59.875
What happened?

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.458
He tried to nick something.

01:13:01.458 --> 01:13:02.833
What are you talking about?

01:13:05.041 --> 01:13:06.791
He's a fucking idiot.

01:13:06.791 --> 01:13:07.875
Move!
Please.

01:13:11.583 --> 01:13:12.708
Fuck.

01:13:16.750 --> 01:13:18.833
<i>♪ Because you're gorgeous ♪</i>

01:13:18.833 --> 01:13:21.458
I mean, it's outrageous!

01:13:21.458 --> 01:13:22.833
What
actually happened?

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:24.375
He sent an email
to Sotheby's

01:13:24.375 --> 01:13:25.666
to say that he'd "come by"

01:13:25.666 --> 01:13:27.333
- some Palissy plates.

01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:28.708
I mean, the idiot.
He had to have known

01:13:28.708 --> 01:13:30.291
that Dad went to school
with the chairman.

01:13:30.291 --> 01:13:32.875
I mean,
talk about biting the hand.

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:35.291
And Mum and Dad would give him
anything he asked for.

01:13:35.291 --> 01:13:38.416
Yeah, well, obviously
he got sick of asking.

01:13:38.416 --> 01:13:41.166
That's ridiculous.
He's more spoilt than we are.

01:13:41.166 --> 01:13:43.333
I mean, come on, Vee. You...
You have to admit.

01:13:43.333 --> 01:13:44.666
It's a little bit dark,
him having to go

01:13:44.666 --> 01:13:46.291
to Mum and Dad
with a begging bowl.

01:13:46.291 --> 01:13:48.083
- Oh, boo-fucking-hoo.
All right, yes.

01:13:48.083 --> 01:13:49.958
Fine, it was incredibly
fucking stupid...

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:51.041
Guys, guys, guys.

01:13:53.041 --> 01:13:54.291
Oliver,
don't mention it, okay?

01:13:54.291 --> 01:13:56.041
What happens
if they bring him up?

01:13:56.541 --> 01:13:58.958
- They won't.
- What a glorious day.

01:13:58.958 --> 01:14:01.416
Never known a summer
as hot as this one.

01:14:01.416 --> 01:14:02.500
Sweltering.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:04.291
I think it's even hotter
than last year.

01:14:04.291 --> 01:14:05.416
I didn't think
that was possible,

01:14:05.416 --> 01:14:07.333
but here we are again.

01:14:07.333 --> 01:14:10.291
It's hotter than Barbados,
apparently. Barbados!

01:14:10.291 --> 01:14:11.416
No, I can
believe it, darling.

01:14:11.416 --> 01:14:13.875
Honestly, I don't think I've
ever been hotter in my life.

01:14:13.875 --> 01:14:15.166
Oh,
I need to check with Robert...

01:14:15.166 --> 01:14:16.291
- ...to make sure that

01:14:16.291 --> 01:14:17.375
he's being extra vigilant
with the hydrangeas.

01:14:17.375 --> 01:14:18.500
Very wise, my love.

01:14:20.166 --> 01:14:21.416
Oh, bliss.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.291
Bliss, bliss, bliss.

01:14:24.708 --> 01:14:25.833
Mmm!

01:14:27.083 --> 01:14:29.583
Oh, this song. God, I haven't
heard this song in forever.

01:14:31.125 --> 01:14:33.250
I used to hang out
with them all, actually,

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.208
when I was modelling.
Britpop, Blur, Oasis.

01:14:36.208 --> 01:14:38.958
God, the parties.
Oh, but then, of course,

01:14:38.958 --> 01:14:40.250
<i>Common People</i> came out

01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:42.000
and everybody thought
it was written about me.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.625
Which was completely
mortifying and ridiculous.

01:14:44.625 --> 01:14:46.458
I mean, I barely knew Jarvis.

01:14:46.958 --> 01:14:48.750
What?
She came from Greece.

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:49.958
She had a thirst
for knowledge.

01:14:49.958 --> 01:14:51.041
It couldn't have been me.

01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:52.583
I've never wanted
to know anything.

01:14:54.291 --> 01:14:57.375
God, I wish we didn't
have to go to London.

01:14:57.375 --> 01:14:58.875
I didn't know you were
going to London.

01:14:58.875 --> 01:15:00.083
Pamela's funeral.

01:15:00.083 --> 01:15:02.416
-  Oh.
- Pamela died?

01:15:02.416 --> 01:15:03.583
Yeah.

01:15:03.583 --> 01:15:05.333
She'd do anything
for attention.

01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:38.000
Morning, birthday boy.

01:16:41.500 --> 01:16:43.250
Get dressed.
We're going on a road trip.

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:44.750
Where?

01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:46.833
Oh, it's a surprise.

01:16:46.833 --> 01:16:47.916
Wear something nice.

01:17:22.625 --> 01:17:24.041
How much further is it?

01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.250
It's not too far now.

01:17:38.791 --> 01:17:41.291
Er, please tell me you're...

01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:43.208
Felix, are...

01:17:43.208 --> 01:17:44.958
Look, Ollie,
just hear me out, all right?

01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:46.166
No, no, no.
- Hear me out for a sec.

01:17:46.166 --> 01:17:47.333
What have you done?
What have you done?

01:17:47.333 --> 01:17:49.375
- Your mum called a week ago.
- Er...

01:17:49.375 --> 01:17:50.708
You left your phone
in the bathroom,

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:52.000
so I thought, I thought...

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.500
I, sort of, just picked up.

01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:54.875
I mean, you've been ignoring
her calls for weeks

01:17:54.875 --> 01:17:57.041
and I just thought that
maybe I could help.

01:17:57.041 --> 01:18:00.375
And on the phone, she really
sounded sober, mate.

01:18:00.375 --> 01:18:02.833
She had no idea where you were
and she just wanted

01:18:02.833 --> 01:18:04.250
to send you a card
for your birthday.

01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:06.333
Please turn the car round.
You can't take me there.

01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:08.041
You can't. Felix, you can't
take me there.

01:18:08.041 --> 01:18:09.166
- Ollie, she's your mother.
- No!

01:18:09.166 --> 01:18:10.791
She's your family!

01:18:10.791 --> 01:18:12.375
- She's all that you've got.
- You don't understand!

01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:13.500
- Ollie, she's your...
- You don't!

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:14.583
- I'm begging you.
- Mate...

01:18:14.583 --> 01:18:16.041
I'm begging you. Please, no.

01:18:16.041 --> 01:18:18.000
I'm not taking "no" for
an answer, mate. I'm sorry.

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:19.500
You have to fix this, mate.

01:18:28.666 --> 01:18:31.333
Oh, look, there's a sign.
Churchill Avenue. Right.

01:18:31.333 --> 01:18:32.541
Oh, 138.

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:34.375
Is this it?

01:18:36.333 --> 01:18:38.250
- Oh, this is nice, mate.

01:18:38.250 --> 01:18:40.291
Look, she's clearly
cleaned up her act.

01:18:40.791 --> 01:18:41.833
This is lovely.

01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:45.750
Let's do this.

01:18:47.750 --> 01:18:49.291
Let me go in
without you, please.

01:18:49.291 --> 01:18:50.500
I'm not leaving you, mate.

01:18:51.166 --> 01:18:52.166
We're in this together.

01:19:33.333 --> 01:19:35.250
Oliver! Oh!

01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:37.375
Praise you're alive.

01:19:38.958 --> 01:19:40.166
I didn't recognise you.

01:19:43.125 --> 01:19:44.375
Happy birthday, darling.

01:19:47.166 --> 01:19:49.958
You must be Felix.
It's so nice to meet you.

01:19:49.958 --> 01:19:51.166
Your father's in the garden.

01:19:51.166 --> 01:19:53.083
- His father?
Yeah.

01:19:53.541 --> 01:19:55.916
He's been pacing around
all morning. He's so excited.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:57.541
Come in. Come in.

01:19:58.208 --> 01:19:59.208
Jeff!

01:20:05.041 --> 01:20:06.833
Oh, that was in Mykonos.

01:20:06.833 --> 01:20:08.208
We go every year.

01:20:08.208 --> 01:20:09.333
Well, not any more.

01:20:09.333 --> 01:20:11.583
No, not now
the kids are all grown up.

01:20:11.583 --> 01:20:12.666
Kids?

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:14.875
You told me you were
an only child, Oliver?

01:20:14.875 --> 01:20:17.541
No, I've always talked about
my sisters.

01:20:21.958 --> 01:20:23.083
All right.

01:20:23.083 --> 01:20:24.166
Well, I must have...

01:20:24.166 --> 01:20:25.916
I must have forgotten.

01:20:25.916 --> 01:20:27.666
I'm not surprised
if he didn't.

01:20:27.666 --> 01:20:29.500
He always wanted
to be an only child,

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.166
always beetling off
by himself.

01:20:31.166 --> 01:20:33.333
I bet, yeah. Yeah, I bet.

01:20:33.333 --> 01:20:35.541
They didn't know what to do
with him at his school.

01:20:35.541 --> 01:20:36.875
He was so clever.

01:20:36.875 --> 01:20:38.291
That's why I think

01:20:38.291 --> 01:20:39.958
he found it hard
to make friends.

01:20:39.958 --> 01:20:41.291
The others were jealous.

01:20:43.416 --> 01:20:47.000
And now he's the top scholar
at Oxford.

01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:49.416
- The top scholar?

01:20:50.333 --> 01:20:51.416
God, he's so modest.

01:20:51.416 --> 01:20:53.666
You know, I... I had no idea.

01:20:53.666 --> 01:20:55.208
It's been hard not seeing him.

01:20:55.208 --> 01:20:57.666
Yeah, but it must be a lot
of pressure, though, I expect.

01:20:57.666 --> 01:20:58.750
Oh, yeah.

01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:00.291
- Yeah, of course it is.
- I bet. Yeah, I can't imagine.

01:21:00.291 --> 01:21:01.375
Working day and night.

01:21:01.375 --> 01:21:03.750
And then, on top of it all,
he's got the union.

01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:05.208
- The plays.

01:21:05.208 --> 01:21:06.291
- Yeah, the plays.
The rowing team.

01:21:06.291 --> 01:21:07.416
- The rowing team?
Oh, yeah...

01:21:07.416 --> 01:21:09.250
I've gotta go.
What d'you mean?

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:11.708
I've got these
horrible migraines.

01:21:11.708 --> 01:21:14.416
Oh. Why don't you lie down
upstairs, darling?

01:21:14.416 --> 01:21:15.833
I made your bed up
in case you wanted to stay.

01:21:15.833 --> 01:21:16.916
We've got to get back.
We've...

01:21:16.916 --> 01:21:18.625
We've got to get back
for my party.

01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:19.708
Oliver...
Oliver, your mother spent

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:20.875
- all morning making lunch.
It doesn't matter.

01:21:20.875 --> 01:21:22.875
- It does matter. It does.
No, it's all right.

01:21:22.875 --> 01:21:24.541
- If he's not well...
It's not okay.

01:21:24.541 --> 01:21:25.916
It doesn't matter,
it's only spag bol.

01:21:25.916 --> 01:21:27.166
And the cake?

01:21:27.916 --> 01:21:29.041
It doesn't matter.

01:21:29.041 --> 01:21:31.166
Of course we can stay,
we would love to stay.

01:21:31.833 --> 01:21:32.916
Ollie, just take a pill
or something,

01:21:32.916 --> 01:21:34.125
for Christ's sake.

01:21:42.708 --> 01:21:44.125
I love spag bol.

01:21:51.041 --> 01:21:53.791
Felix, look, Felix,

01:21:53.791 --> 01:21:55.125
please, let me just explain.

01:21:55.125 --> 01:21:56.333
I think the best thing

01:21:56.333 --> 01:21:58.166
is that you go home
after your party.

01:21:58.166 --> 01:21:59.583
It's too late
to cancel it now,

01:21:59.583 --> 01:22:01.041
and summer's almost finished anyway.

01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:04.041
So I think we'll have
your party tonight, and...

01:22:05.666 --> 01:22:07.375
I will see you back at Oxford.

01:22:07.375 --> 01:22:08.833
And we can still be friends, though?

01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:11.500
I mean, we're going
to laugh about this.

01:22:12.291 --> 01:22:13.416
I... I...

01:22:14.583 --> 01:22:15.750
I don't even know
why I said it.

01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:17.125
It's just a stupid thing
to say...

01:22:17.125 --> 01:22:18.625
No, it's fucking weird,
is what it is, mate.

01:22:18.625 --> 01:22:20.083
Honestly, I don't
even know where to start.

01:22:20.083 --> 01:22:22.291
I mean,
you're a fucking liar, Ollie.

01:22:27.833 --> 01:22:28.916
Why would you lie?

01:22:34.083 --> 01:22:35.458
I just wanted
to be your friend.

01:22:44.166 --> 01:22:46.541
Look, let's just
get through tonight.

01:22:46.541 --> 01:22:48.000
Can you not tell your family, please?

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.625
Of course not. Fucking hell!

01:22:49.625 --> 01:22:51.125
It's dark enough as it is!

01:23:25.125 --> 01:23:26.208
Duncan.

01:23:26.208 --> 01:23:27.500

Have you seen Felix?

01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:13.750
Nope.

Oh, no.

01:24:20.125 --> 01:24:22.083
- Oh, fuck.
Felix.

01:24:22.833 --> 01:24:24.666
Can I, er, talk to you
for one second?

01:24:27.541 --> 01:24:29.416
You can't ignore me forever.

01:24:29.416 --> 01:24:30.583
I can try.

01:24:30.583 --> 01:24:32.375
Felix,
we need to talk.

01:24:32.375 --> 01:24:33.583
Felix, come on!

01:24:33.583 --> 01:24:34.666
Look, man, I tried to be nice,

01:24:34.666 --> 01:24:36.250
but can you fuck off
and bother somebody else?

01:24:44.083 --> 01:24:45.333
Who was that?

01:25:18.666 --> 01:25:19.958
Hello, Farleigh.

01:25:19.958 --> 01:25:22.083
How did you know it was me?

01:25:22.666 --> 01:25:23.666
Signet ring.

01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:26.750
God.

01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:28.666
You really do notice
everything, don't you?

01:25:30.791 --> 01:25:31.916
Have they seen you yet?

01:25:32.541 --> 01:25:33.833
Not yet.

01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:37.833
Yeah, they'll go ballistic.

01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:39.750
I doubt it.

01:25:40.416 --> 01:25:41.875
They invited me.

01:25:44.041 --> 01:25:45.291
Ohhh!
Mmm.

01:25:46.666 --> 01:25:47.708
Mmm.

01:25:50.541 --> 01:25:52.208
God, the look on your face.

01:25:52.208 --> 01:25:54.083
They can't have invited you.

01:25:54.083 --> 01:25:56.500
Oh, Oliver,
you'll never catch on.

01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:59.041
This place...

01:25:59.875 --> 01:26:01.625
You know,
it's not for you.

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:05.166
It is a fucking dream.

01:26:05.166 --> 01:26:07.166
It is an anecdote
you'll bore your fat kids

01:26:07.166 --> 01:26:08.375
with at Christmas.

01:26:09.166 --> 01:26:11.791
Oliver's once in a lifetime

01:26:11.791 --> 01:26:15.291
handjob on a hay bale,
golden, big boy summer!

01:26:17.875 --> 01:26:19.250
You'll cling on to it,

01:26:19.833 --> 01:26:21.875
and comb over it,
and jerk off to it,

01:26:21.875 --> 01:26:24.166
and you'll wonder how
you could ever

01:26:24.833 --> 01:26:27.791
ever, ever, ever get it back.

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:29.958
But you don't get it back.

01:26:32.541 --> 01:26:34.166
Because your summer's over.

01:26:36.208 --> 01:26:37.333
And so you...

01:26:37.333 --> 01:26:39.291
Oh...

01:26:39.291 --> 01:26:40.416
You...

01:26:41.208 --> 01:26:42.416
catch a train...

01:26:44.291 --> 01:26:46.416
to whatever
creepy doll factory

01:26:46.416 --> 01:26:48.458
it is they make Olivers in.

01:26:48.458 --> 01:26:51.666
And I come back here.

01:26:54.916 --> 01:26:56.250
This isn't a dream to me.

01:26:58.041 --> 01:26:59.083
It's my house.

01:27:01.291 --> 01:27:04.958
So whatever happens,
I always come back.

01:27:08.416 --> 01:27:10.000

What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:30:04.333 --> 01:30:06.583
I need to talk to you.
Were you spying on us?

01:30:06.583 --> 01:30:07.833
No, I wasn't.

01:30:07.833 --> 01:30:10.041
You know,
you two are fucking gross.

01:30:10.041 --> 01:30:11.208
Fucking hell, mate.

01:30:11.791 --> 01:30:13.458
God...

01:30:13.458 --> 01:30:15.416
What the fuck
is wrong with you, Oliver?

01:30:15.416 --> 01:30:16.875
Leave me the fuck alone!

01:30:16.875 --> 01:30:18.375
- No, we need to talk.
- Please stop.

01:30:18.375 --> 01:30:20.166
We can't... We can't,
are you fucking crazy?

01:30:20.166 --> 01:30:22.208
- You can't just throw me away.
- Get the fuck away from me.

01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:24.500
Ah, fuck...

01:30:24.500 --> 01:30:27.000
Look, I just gave you
what you wanted!

01:30:29.958 --> 01:30:31.208

01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:34.125
Everyone puts on
a show for Felix.

01:30:37.041 --> 01:30:38.500
So I'm sorry that...

01:30:38.500 --> 01:30:40.291
my performance
wasn't good enough.

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:43.000
I think...

01:30:43.916 --> 01:30:45.333
I think you need
to see somebody.

01:30:45.333 --> 01:30:46.583
You need help, okay?
Seriously.

01:30:46.583 --> 01:30:47.875
No. No, I don't.

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:50.625
I just need you to understand
how much I fucking love you.

01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:53.916
You're the only friend
I ever had, Felix.

01:30:56.125 --> 01:30:57.208
Okay...

01:30:57.208 --> 01:30:59.916
I mean, doesn't this
just prove how much,

01:30:59.916 --> 01:31:01.708
how much of a good friend
I actually am?

01:31:02.708 --> 01:31:04.041
How well I actually know you?

01:31:04.916 --> 01:31:06.333
I'm still the same person.

01:31:07.916 --> 01:31:10.083
Yeah?
I'm still the same person.

01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:14.083
I don't know what you are.

01:31:18.291 --> 01:31:19.458
But I do know you,

01:31:20.166 --> 01:31:22.666
you make my fucking blood
run cold.

01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:41.291
Wait there a sec.

01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:46.166
Fuck. Ah.

01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:05.291
- Better?
- Fuck you.

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.833
I think
you should go to bed.

01:32:13.375 --> 01:32:15.166
I don't care
what you think any more.

01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:28.833
Oh, fuck.

01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:39.000
Felix!

01:33:41.041 --> 01:33:42.583

Felix!

<i>Knowing that any second...</i>

01:34:58.166 --> 01:35:00.166
<i>the ground
was gonna fall away.</i>

01:35:19.666 --> 01:35:20.958
It's the end of everything.

01:36:10.791 --> 01:36:12.291
Darling, darling boy.

01:36:14.166 --> 01:36:15.666
- My darling boy.

01:36:18.375 --> 01:36:19.875
Help me move him.

01:36:19.875 --> 01:36:21.208
We need to get him inside.

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:22.291
Get him warm.

01:36:26.708 --> 01:36:28.250
I just need
to get him warmed up.

01:36:30.291 --> 01:36:31.458
Felix, darling,

01:36:32.291 --> 01:36:33.750
where's your jumper?

01:36:33.750 --> 01:36:34.958
Hmm?

01:36:34.958 --> 01:36:36.125
Where's your jumper?

01:36:39.875 --> 01:36:41.625
Come on now! Help me.

01:36:43.375 --> 01:36:44.791
I don't think
we can move him, James.

01:36:44.791 --> 01:36:47.208
I think... I think the police.

01:36:47.208 --> 01:36:48.291
Yes.

01:36:49.166 --> 01:36:50.375
Yes, come away, darling.

01:36:52.333 --> 01:36:53.333
It's nearly lunch.

01:36:53.875 --> 01:36:54.875
Yes.

01:37:26.166 --> 01:37:27.166
What is it, Duncan?

01:37:27.166 --> 01:37:29.166
It's the police,
Your Ladyship.

01:37:30.541 --> 01:37:31.708
They're having trouble.

01:37:33.208 --> 01:37:34.458
What kind of trouble?

01:37:34.458 --> 01:37:36.500
They keep getting lost
in the maze.

01:37:38.125 --> 01:37:39.125
And?

01:37:40.583 --> 01:37:42.083
May I send
one of the gardeners

01:37:42.083 --> 01:37:43.291
- to assist them, sir?
- Fine.

01:37:47.458 --> 01:37:48.541
Oliver, darling.

01:37:48.541 --> 01:37:50.250
Why don't you tell us
about last night?

01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:53.583
- Last night?
Mmm.

01:37:53.583 --> 01:37:55.041
Did you have a lovely time?

01:37:55.833 --> 01:37:57.583
Yeah, it was, er, wonderful.

01:37:58.166 --> 01:37:59.416
- Thank you.
Oh, good.

01:37:59.416 --> 01:38:01.125
I think it was a hit.
Don't you, darling?

01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:02.500
Oh, yes, a triumph.

01:38:02.500 --> 01:38:04.208
Yes. The house
looked good, didn't it?

01:38:04.208 --> 01:38:06.541
Beautiful.
- And that cake was...

01:38:06.541 --> 01:38:07.958
Oh, did you like it?

01:38:07.958 --> 01:38:09.666
- Mm-hmm.
- I never had any in the end.

01:38:09.666 --> 01:38:10.958
That's always the way,
isn't it?

01:38:10.958 --> 01:38:12.208
You end up running around
so much

01:38:12.208 --> 01:38:13.500
you miss the actual party.

01:38:16.708 --> 01:38:17.791
What now?

01:38:18.916 --> 01:38:21.416
May I be permitted
to close the curtains, sir?

01:38:22.458 --> 01:38:24.291
Sir, the coroner's outside

01:38:24.291 --> 01:38:26.125
and may need
to pass the window with...

01:38:26.125 --> 01:38:27.750
Yes, thank you. Close them.

01:38:29.166 --> 01:38:31.458
I don't normally
like chocolate cake.

01:38:31.458 --> 01:38:33.500
Yes, it can be cloying,
can't it?

01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:35.750
Mmm, but last night
it was so light.

01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:38.416
Yes, Lynn has always
been an expert with cakes.

01:38:38.416 --> 01:38:40.208
Yes, cold hands, apparently.

01:38:40.208 --> 01:38:41.541
You have to have cold hands.

01:38:41.541 --> 01:38:43.750
Mm-hmm, I've heard.

01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:45.583
So the butter doesn't melt.

01:38:45.583 --> 01:38:47.250
Although
I would think

01:38:47.250 --> 01:38:48.750
that applied more
to pastry than to...

01:38:48.750 --> 01:38:51.708
Duncan, just get them closed,
for Christ's sake!

01:38:51.708 --> 01:38:54.125
Yes, I am trying, sir.
I can't.

01:38:57.458 --> 01:38:58.625
- I'm so sorry.

01:38:59.958 --> 01:39:01.041
I'm so sorry.

01:39:29.333 --> 01:39:31.333
Oh, my God.

01:39:32.416 --> 01:39:34.916
Er, may I be excused, please?

01:39:34.916 --> 01:39:36.541
No, we haven't finished lunch.

01:39:36.541 --> 01:39:38.541
Lunch is cold.

01:39:39.125 --> 01:39:41.250
You want me just to eat it
like nothing's happening?

01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:42.875
What else is there to do, darling?

01:39:42.875 --> 01:39:45.541
- Anything! Anything!
-  Farleigh!

01:39:45.541 --> 01:39:46.875
Will you be quiet?

01:39:46.875 --> 01:39:48.708
Sit down
and eat the bloody pie!

01:39:48.708 --> 01:39:49.958
Just eat it!

01:39:49.958 --> 01:39:51.958
Eat it and shut up!

01:39:51.958 --> 01:39:53.500
Eat the bloody pie!

01:39:56.458 --> 01:39:58.625
You're not the only person
here with feelings.

01:40:00.375 --> 01:40:02.916
None of us wants
your bloody American feelings.

01:40:02.916 --> 01:40:04.458
I think it's delicious.

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:12.541
What the fuck
are you still doing here?

01:40:14.750 --> 01:40:16.625
Wait, does no one else
find it weird?

01:40:18.416 --> 01:40:19.791
No one else finds that weird?

01:40:19.791 --> 01:40:21.666
I wouldn't throw stones
if I was you, Farleigh.

01:40:21.666 --> 01:40:23.416
Excuse me?
- Please stop.

01:40:23.416 --> 01:40:25.458
What is he saying?
- I... I have no idea.

01:40:25.458 --> 01:40:27.833
What I'm saying
is I would feel guilty too.

01:40:27.833 --> 01:40:29.375
- Guilty?
If I was the one

01:40:29.375 --> 01:40:31.666
racking up lines
the night someone died.

01:40:33.875 --> 01:40:36.708
- Fuck you.
- That's not a denial.

01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:38.916
Is that true?

01:40:41.291 --> 01:40:42.291
Search Farleigh's room.

01:40:42.291 --> 01:40:43.458
- Yes, sir.
- No.

01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:47.250
Get out!

01:40:47.250 --> 01:40:49.041
-  No, wait...

01:40:49.041 --> 01:40:50.708
- Erm...
- What's happening?

01:40:50.708 --> 01:40:52.500
Aunt Elspeth... Elspeth...

01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:54.125
Don't you dare look at her!

01:40:54.833 --> 01:40:55.833
Get out!

01:40:58.166 --> 01:40:59.791
I won't mention this
to the police.

01:41:00.666 --> 01:41:01.916
That's all you'll get.

01:41:01.916 --> 01:41:03.000
Nothing more,

01:41:03.625 --> 01:41:04.666
ever again.

The vicar did well.

01:45:50.916 --> 01:45:53.875
Yes,
so much nicer than his father.

01:45:53.875 --> 01:45:55.333
Oh, he was all right.

01:45:55.333 --> 01:45:56.708
Just a little old fashioned.

01:45:56.708 --> 01:45:58.375
Extremely old fashioned.

01:45:58.916 --> 01:46:00.333
Do you remember
Felix's christening?

01:46:00.333 --> 01:46:01.833
- Mm-hmm.
-"You can't possibly

01:46:01.833 --> 01:46:03.583
"have River as a middle name."
Do you remember?

01:46:03.583 --> 01:46:06.333
Hm.  I remember
you giving him what for.

01:46:08.250 --> 01:46:09.458
It doesn't matter now.

01:46:10.458 --> 01:46:12.833
It doesn't matter
what his middle name is now.

01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:14.583
- Darling.
He was right.

01:46:14.583 --> 01:46:16.625
River is quite silly.

01:46:16.625 --> 01:46:19.416
But I suppose you don't pick
your child's name

01:46:19.416 --> 01:46:21.833
imagining that one day
you'll have to think about

01:46:21.833 --> 01:46:23.541
how it will look...

01:46:26.916 --> 01:46:28.000
carved on a...

01:46:29.083 --> 01:46:31.500
headstone.
Choose a font.

01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:32.875
What font did you choose?

01:46:35.166 --> 01:46:36.333
Times New Roman.

01:46:38.875 --> 01:46:40.083
On local stone.

01:46:40.625 --> 01:46:42.250
- It'll be good, I think.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:46:43.041 --> 01:46:45.125
It's a good choice. Solid.

01:46:47.208 --> 01:46:48.250
I'll leave you.

01:46:48.250 --> 01:46:50.750
You're not going anywhere,
Oliver, darling?

01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:52.125
I was just going upstairs.

01:46:52.125 --> 01:46:53.541
But you're not leaving us?

01:46:55.250 --> 01:46:56.750
You're not leaving Saltburn?

01:47:08.541 --> 01:47:09.916
Ah, sorry.

01:47:10.833 --> 01:47:14.916
Your politeness is so grating.

01:47:14.916 --> 01:47:18.708
- Do you know that?
- Erm, sorry?

01:47:18.708 --> 01:47:20.166
You're always sorry.

01:47:21.416 --> 01:47:25.958
Always flinching away
like a little fucking...

01:47:27.583 --> 01:47:28.708
serf.

01:47:36.250 --> 01:47:37.250
I saw you.

01:47:39.833 --> 01:47:42.083
Sobbing in the church
at the funeral.

01:47:43.250 --> 01:47:45.833
I watched you weeping away
and I just...

01:47:47.583 --> 01:47:49.416
I felt so sorry for you.

01:47:51.375 --> 01:47:52.416
So sorry.

01:47:55.500 --> 01:47:56.875
And then I remembered...

01:48:00.958 --> 01:48:03.666
and I started laughing.

01:48:11.375 --> 01:48:12.458
I just...

01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:16.125
I just couldn't stop laughing

01:48:16.125 --> 01:48:19.125
because I...
I remembered that...

01:48:20.750 --> 01:48:24.041
that you only knew him for...

01:48:26.125 --> 01:48:28.041
six months?

01:48:30.166 --> 01:48:31.958
You hardly knew him, Ollie.

01:48:32.791 --> 01:48:35.291
You have nothing to do

01:48:35.291 --> 01:48:38.708
with him, with us,

01:48:39.416 --> 01:48:40.500
with here.

01:48:41.583 --> 01:48:43.125
Nothing at all.

01:48:44.958 --> 01:48:47.041
You're just a stranger.

01:48:48.583 --> 01:48:51.916
- It's very late.
- Yet, here you are.

01:48:52.916 --> 01:48:54.708
Right in the middle of it all.

01:48:55.333 --> 01:48:56.333
Ooh.

01:48:58.083 --> 01:49:01.500
Stranger fucking danger.

01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:03.541
- Yeah, I'm going to bed.

01:49:04.375 --> 01:49:05.708
Ollie, you know...

01:49:06.583 --> 01:49:08.333
You know what
Daddy's starting to call you?

01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:11.041
Spiderman.

01:49:12.541 --> 01:49:14.333
- Really?
- Because you're always

01:49:14.333 --> 01:49:16.458
just skulking around.

01:49:17.416 --> 01:49:24.000
Weaving your spider-y,
Oliver-y web.

01:49:25.166 --> 01:49:26.875
Good night.
Drink some water...

01:49:26.875 --> 01:49:30.000
Hey, Ollie, Ollie,
don't be upset.

01:49:32.541 --> 01:49:34.083
I don't think you're a spider.

01:49:37.166 --> 01:49:39.875
I think you're a moth.

01:49:42.375 --> 01:49:43.958
I'm right, aren't I?

01:49:46.041 --> 01:49:47.458
Quiet...

01:49:49.083 --> 01:49:50.333
harmless...

01:49:51.083 --> 01:49:53.458
drawn to shiny things...

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.541
batting up against
the window...

01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:06.083
just desperate to get in.

01:50:09.583 --> 01:50:10.958
Well, you've done it now.

01:50:16.833 --> 01:50:19.500
You've made your holes

01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:21.791
in everything.

01:50:25.041 --> 01:50:27.250
You'll eat us
from the inside out.

01:50:27.250 --> 01:50:29.250
- You've drunk way too much.
- Yeah.

01:50:29.250 --> 01:50:30.375
Hm.

01:50:33.375 --> 01:50:34.916
Isn't that his aftershave?

01:50:34.916 --> 01:50:36.125
Hm?

01:50:38.625 --> 01:50:43.166
You are a fucking freak.

01:50:43.666 --> 01:50:46.458
I bet you're wearing
his underwear too, aren't you?

01:50:46.458 --> 01:50:47.541
Yeah.

01:50:47.541 --> 01:50:51.166
You disgusting little nobody.

01:50:51.166 --> 01:50:52.541
Oh, my God!

01:50:52.541 --> 01:50:54.583
You ate him right up

01:50:54.583 --> 01:50:58.000
and you licked
the fucking plate!

01:51:37.916 --> 01:51:39.333
It broke her completely.

01:51:42.208 --> 01:51:43.458
She said it herself.

01:51:44.833 --> 01:51:46.458
She couldn't live without him.

01:52:17.125 --> 01:52:18.625
Thank you
for coming to see me.

01:52:24.125 --> 01:52:25.750
Is everything all right?

01:52:27.041 --> 01:52:28.041
Er...

01:52:33.791 --> 01:52:35.916
How long were you planning
on staying with us?

01:52:35.916 --> 01:52:37.375
Because Elspeth
won't let you go.

01:52:38.458 --> 01:52:40.625
Erm, I'm happy to stay

01:52:40.625 --> 01:52:43.125
- as long as she needs me to.
- Very kind of you.

01:52:43.125 --> 01:52:46.166
But I'm not sure
that's good for her or us.

01:52:47.416 --> 01:52:48.583
I think it's time, Oliver,

01:52:48.583 --> 01:52:51.333
for you to go home
discreetly tonight,

01:52:52.208 --> 01:52:53.541
to cause her
the least anxiety.

01:52:53.541 --> 01:52:54.791
I hope you understand.

01:52:54.791 --> 01:52:56.833
I'd go in a heartbeat
if I could.

01:52:58.250 --> 01:53:01.750
I just don't think
I can leave her in this state.

01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:02.833
Well...

01:53:03.375 --> 01:53:05.958
It would be best if the family
was able to grieve in private.

01:53:05.958 --> 01:53:07.833
Oh, I...
I understand, I agree.

01:53:07.833 --> 01:53:08.916
I agree.

01:53:10.375 --> 01:53:12.333
But I just think
it's best if I stay

01:53:12.333 --> 01:53:13.625
just for the time being.

01:53:14.833 --> 01:53:17.000
I want to do
what's right for her.

01:53:21.416 --> 01:53:22.416
You won't go?

01:53:22.416 --> 01:53:24.000
I don't see how I can.

01:53:35.833 --> 01:53:36.833
What are you doing?

01:53:38.916 --> 01:53:40.916
- How much?
- Excuse me?

01:53:40.916 --> 01:53:42.458
How much for you to leave
and never come back?

01:53:42.458 --> 01:53:44.333
To cease all contact
with my wife?

01:53:44.333 --> 01:53:45.458
- Why?
- Because we all

01:53:45.458 --> 01:53:46.583
have to move on.

01:53:47.875 --> 01:53:49.750
- I know you live under

01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:51.541
somewhat
difficult circumstances,

01:53:51.541 --> 01:53:53.750
but this will be a fresh start
for you too.

01:53:53.750 --> 01:53:55.541
Why are you doing this?

01:53:56.458 --> 01:53:58.208
How much?

01:54:03.208 --> 01:54:04.500
How much?

01:54:05.916 --> 01:54:06.916
How much?

01:55:19.625 --> 01:55:21.250
Thanks.

01:55:39.083 --> 01:55:40.083
Oliver.

01:55:42.125 --> 01:55:43.583
- Oliver.
- Elspeth.

01:55:44.416 --> 01:55:47.666
- My God.
- Oh, Ollie!

01:55:48.583 --> 01:55:50.250
Oh, how handsome you look!

01:55:50.250 --> 01:55:51.583
I can't believe it.

01:55:52.791 --> 01:55:54.541
But you're all grown up,
you're...

01:55:54.541 --> 01:55:56.041
Of course, you're grown up.

01:55:56.041 --> 01:55:58.166
Of course, silly of me,
of course.

01:55:59.375 --> 01:56:00.500
You grew up.

01:56:01.916 --> 01:56:03.500
- Sorry.

01:56:04.166 --> 01:56:05.500
I'm all over the place
at the moment.

01:56:05.500 --> 01:56:08.291
I... I read the news
about Sir James.

01:56:09.250 --> 01:56:10.791
I'm so dreadfully sorry.

01:56:14.083 --> 01:56:16.500
I was surprised
he waited so long in a way.

01:56:17.541 --> 01:56:18.541
You know...

01:56:20.833 --> 01:56:23.000
But still it was a...
a terrible shock.

01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:24.083
Yeah.

01:56:25.833 --> 01:56:27.166
It's so funny to see you.

01:56:28.875 --> 01:56:31.208
I've actually just bought
a little flat nearby.

01:56:31.208 --> 01:56:32.583
Oh, what are the odds?

01:56:32.583 --> 01:56:35.208
Saltburn suddenly seemed
so big and so far away.

01:56:35.208 --> 01:56:37.833
How is Saltburn?
Er, is Duncan still there?

01:56:37.833 --> 01:56:39.000
Oh, God, he's still there.

01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.125
Oh, everything's the same.

01:56:40.125 --> 01:56:42.250
Exactly, exactly the same
as when you left it.

01:56:43.041 --> 01:56:45.416
I'm glad.

01:56:45.416 --> 01:56:48.583
Ollie, I didn't like it
the way James treated you,

01:56:49.708 --> 01:56:51.166
and I wanted to say something.

01:56:51.666 --> 01:56:53.125
Oh, it was a long time ago.

01:56:53.125 --> 01:56:54.583
No, but it's not to me.

01:56:54.583 --> 01:56:56.625
You see,
I've thought about it a lot.

01:56:57.333 --> 01:56:58.333
And...

01:56:59.750 --> 01:57:00.750
you have to remember

01:57:00.750 --> 01:57:02.291
that he wasn't
in his right mind then,

01:57:02.291 --> 01:57:03.625
after everything
that happened.

01:57:04.583 --> 01:57:05.583
And he...

01:57:07.125 --> 01:57:09.250
You do forgive him,
you do understand?

01:57:11.166 --> 01:57:12.166
Of course.

01:57:18.375 --> 01:57:19.541
Have you been happy?

01:57:23.500 --> 01:57:24.541
Not really.

01:57:26.208 --> 01:57:27.208
You?

01:57:29.166 --> 01:57:30.416
Not really.

01:57:32.958 --> 01:57:33.958
Flat white.

01:57:46.666 --> 01:57:47.833
Come up and stay.

01:57:48.708 --> 01:57:49.750
At Saltburn.

01:57:51.375 --> 01:57:53.000
Coast is clear now, isn't it?

01:58:04.458 --> 01:58:06.708
I can honestly say
that these last few months

01:58:06.708 --> 01:58:08.666
have been the happiest
of my life.

01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.250
It's just such a shame
you got so ill.

01:58:32.041 --> 01:58:34.000
But it's been a privilege
to look after you.

01:58:36.208 --> 01:58:39.083
<i>Just as it'll be a privilege
to look after Saltburn.</i>

01:58:41.416 --> 01:58:44.500
<i>So thank you for trusting me.</i>

01:58:47.416 --> 01:58:49.416
<i>I promise
I'll look after this house</i>

01:58:49.416 --> 01:58:50.791
<i>just as Felix would have.</i>

01:58:55.166 --> 01:58:57.000
We got there in the end,
didn't we?

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.208
Somehow.

01:58:59.541 --> 01:59:00.583
Thank God.

01:59:01.375 --> 01:59:04.708
After all those terrible,
terrible accidents.

01:59:09.041 --> 01:59:10.125
But...

01:59:11.791 --> 01:59:13.416
is there really
ever such a thing

01:59:13.416 --> 01:59:15.041
as an accident, Elspeth?

01:59:17.583 --> 01:59:19.208
- I don't know.

01:59:21.208 --> 01:59:23.083
Accidents are for people
like you.

01:59:23.625 --> 01:59:25.791
For the rest of us,
there's work.

01:59:26.458 --> 01:59:27.666
And unlike you,

01:59:28.416 --> 01:59:30.000
I actually know how to work.

01:59:42.125 --> 01:59:44.125
Please, I...
I don't have any money.

01:59:45.875 --> 01:59:47.416
Could I just pay you tomorrow?

01:59:48.791 --> 01:59:50.333
<i>What actually happened?</i>

01:59:50.333 --> 01:59:51.958
<i>He sent an email
to Sotheby's</i>

01:59:51.958 --> 01:59:54.583
<i>to say that he'd "come by"
some Palissy plates.</i>

01:59:56.750 --> 01:59:58.875
<i>I've actually just
bought a little flat nearby.</i>

02:00:00.000 --> 02:00:01.000
Oliver.

02:00:09.041 --> 02:00:10.666
I wasn't "in love" with him.

02:00:12.083 --> 02:00:14.125
I know,
everyone thought I was.

02:00:14.125 --> 02:00:15.208
But I wasn't.

02:00:16.750 --> 02:00:17.916
<i>I loved him.</i>

02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.500
<i>I loved him.</i>

02:00:23.916 --> 02:00:26.791
<i>I loved him.
By God, I loved him.</i>

02:00:28.458 --> 02:00:29.541
<i>But sometimes...</i>

02:00:30.583 --> 02:00:31.583
I...

02:00:33.125 --> 02:00:34.166
I hated him.

02:00:55.125 --> 02:00:56.625
- I hated him.

02:00:59.750 --> 02:01:01.458
Yeah, I hated him.

02:01:14.875 --> 02:01:16.416
I hated all of you.

02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.791
And you made it so easy.

02:01:24.416 --> 02:01:26.958
Spoiled dogs,
sleeping belly-up.

02:01:29.666 --> 02:01:31.375
<i>No natural predators.</i>

02:01:45.000 --> 02:01:46.000
Well...

02:01:47.208 --> 02:01:48.291
almost none.
