00:17.617 --> 00:24.380
Edit: r3p0

00:41.857 --> 00:46.275
The Specialist (1994)

01:09.486 --> 01:10.652
Nice view.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.955
Perfect timing.

02:15.009 --> 02:17.177
Wait a minute. He's not alone.

02:17.345 --> 02:19.388
That's a heartbreaking piece of news.

02:19.556 --> 02:21.640
Pull the plug, Ned.
There's a kid in the car.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.559
There's a drug lord in the car, Ray.

02:23.852 --> 02:26.770
- Kid just took a bad ride, that's all.
- Abort the action.

02:26.938 --> 02:29.898
You're the rigger.
I am the trigger. I make the call.

02:30.066 --> 02:34.278
You just sit back and watch the show.
Okay, sport?

02:35.738 --> 02:37.948
Activate the fail-safe,
you fucking psycho.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.285
Here's a tip, Ray. There is no fail-safe.

02:41.911 --> 02:43.495
Come on. Come on.

03:06.102 --> 03:07.352
You'll never make it.

04:15.964 --> 04:18.339
You're an arrogant man, Raymond.

04:18.507 --> 04:21.969
I taught you everything you know
and you dare to turn on me.

04:22.136 --> 04:23.762
Are you gonna kill me too, colonel?

04:23.930 --> 04:26.890
You're a specialist, captain.
You deserve better.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.029
Don't forget to write, partner.

05:06.889 --> 05:09.599
You like watching her die?
You like taking them down?

05:09.767 --> 05:13.520
Now I'm taking you down.
You're finished in the agency.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.897
You're going nowhere.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.942
You're as dead as those people...

05:19.110 --> 05:21.111
in the river.

05:21.654 --> 05:22.738
We both are.

05:38.046 --> 05:41.715
Well, slip away

05:46.846 --> 05:53.685
Stuck inside this lonely place

05:53.853 --> 05:57.773
Wonderin' if I'm ever gonna
See your face

05:57.940 --> 06:01.234
It can bring you down

06:01.402 --> 06:07.949
While this world goes round

06:08.117 --> 06:14.331
Time still inside my room

06:14.499 --> 06:19.044
You know it's not too late
Can't be too soon

06:19.212 --> 06:22.714
To be lost and found

06:22.882 --> 06:27.386
To be up and down

06:27.553 --> 06:34.726
And though the world
May close around you

06:34.894 --> 06:37.896
Won't let you slip away

06:38.064 --> 06:42.484
Can't let you slip away from me

07:13.850 --> 07:15.934
Have you decided to take the job?

07:16.102 --> 07:17.936
I saw your ad today.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.105
- I know it's late...
- It's never too late.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.275
After all,
you're about to give me a new life.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.527
Really? When?

07:25.695 --> 07:27.946
When you kill those three bastards.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.282
I'm flattered.

07:30.658 --> 07:33.034
Look, you better get somebody else.

07:33.202 --> 07:35.203
I like your voice.

07:35.371 --> 07:37.914
Yeah, but you don't need
an explosives contractor.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.208
Yes, I do.

07:40.918 --> 07:43.211
- You are my only hope.
- Go to court, use the law.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.505
The law's been bought.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.259
- Then you gotta use a bullet.
- Bullets...

07:49.427 --> 07:50.594
are imprecise.

07:50.761 --> 07:55.098
I heard that you control your explosions,
that you shape your charges.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.726
What I shape and who I shape them for
is my business.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.269
All I'm saying...

07:59.437 --> 08:01.938
word is you were the best.

08:02.106 --> 08:03.356
Whose word?

08:03.524 --> 08:04.983
If we could just meet...

08:05.151 --> 08:08.403
I don't meet, I don't work in Miami
and I don't do jobs like this.

08:08.571 --> 08:11.239
Then why do you keep calling me back?

08:11.407 --> 08:13.116
Why?

08:13.284 --> 08:14.367
I like your voice.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.041
What is it? My cologne?

09:21.644 --> 09:23.144
So, what do you think? You guys coming?

09:23.312 --> 09:24.312
Go ahead, please.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.981
Right.
- How many are there?

09:26.148 --> 09:27.399
Two or eight?

10:20.411 --> 10:23.371
These guys
are killers. You'd be doing the world a favor.

10:23.539 --> 10:27.083
I don't owe the world any favors.
Why did you wait so long?

10:27.251 --> 10:28.293
I thought...

10:29.670 --> 10:32.047
I thought maybe it would pass.

10:32.214 --> 10:34.674
Every day is worse.

10:35.009 --> 10:37.010
Remembering what happened.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.013
That's what I do instead of being alive.

10:40.431 --> 10:43.266
My father hid me in a closet.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.061
I could still see.

10:47.521 --> 10:49.147
My mother suffered.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.816
- No.
- I don't know anything.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.027
They tortured her to get my father to talk.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.570
We're gonna have to kill her.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.448
He walked by something
he shouldn't have seen.

11:00.576 --> 11:03.119
They covered his face
with the pillow from my bed.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.038
- Mommy.
- Waste him.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.040
But it was too small.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.501
So they shot him.

11:11.253 --> 11:14.381
I never thought
blood would be so sticky.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.301
Sometimes I think I can never wash it off.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.650
The only thing I understand
anymore is revenge.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.444
I'm going in and I'm gonna do it myself.

11:36.612 --> 11:39.030
You'll only get one of them.
That's why I need you.

11:41.450 --> 11:42.992
- To do it right.
I told you...

11:43.160 --> 11:45.453
I don't do this kind of job anymore.

12:01.303 --> 12:04.556
I know
you've been watching me, trying to decide...

12:04.724 --> 12:08.643
if I'm on the level,
if you're gonna take the job.

12:08.811 --> 12:10.729
Well, I can't wait anymore, I'm going in.

12:10.896 --> 12:13.648
They'll make you.
I have an alias.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.316
Adrian Hastings.

12:15.484 --> 12:17.318
Wish me luck.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.519
Senor Leon.

12:55.357 --> 12:58.109
So how's it coming in?

12:59.987 --> 13:01.988
Oh, boy. You don't give up. Hmm?

13:03.574 --> 13:07.243
It's packed in Monopoly boxes.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.496
He's right over here.
I want you to meet him.

13:09.663 --> 13:11.498
That's great, Papa.

13:11.665 --> 13:16.377
- You get it in, I'll put it on the street.
- Sure, sure, sure. You do that.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.840
Tomayo, come here.

13:21.008 --> 13:24.135
- Ahem. How you doing, Ned?
- This is a very nice party.

13:24.303 --> 13:27.430
- Yeah.
- You went all out. It's fantastic.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.311
- So let's talk numbers.
- Forget business tonight.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.397
Go grab yourself a nice little mulatta.

13:37.566 --> 13:40.068
I want my money, Tomayo.

13:42.029 --> 13:45.073
An advance.
Small token of my family's goodwill.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.950
Token?

13:47.493 --> 13:49.077
Token.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.457
Now, listen to me, boy.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.084
You know what the Dark Ages are?

13:56.252 --> 13:59.128
The Dark Ages are what I brought
the Leon family out of.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.880
I computerized your operation.

14:01.048 --> 14:05.927
I streamlined your security.
I dragged you into the 20th century.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.638
So don't fuck with me on this.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.139
What is this?

14:10.307 --> 14:13.643
A tip? I don't work for tips.
She works for tips, okay?

14:13.811 --> 14:16.229
Now, I want my money. I want it now.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.314
Go get it.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.485
It's always a pleasure working
with you, Ned.

15:09.533 --> 15:11.200
Champagne, please.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.892
Thank you.

16:15.391 --> 16:17.725
Is there something you want?

16:19.061 --> 16:21.896
What I want, I take.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.439
Champagne?

16:24.149 --> 16:26.192
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.906
Welcome to our bank.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.410
I've never seen you before.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.121
I used to live here when I was a little girl.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.082
A lot's happened
since you've been gone.

16:41.917 --> 16:43.251
Like what?

16:43.419 --> 16:44.460
Like me.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.715
Insecurity is a terrible thing.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.049
It would be.

16:52.636 --> 16:53.761
I'd like to dance.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.139
What's wrong with keeping
the conversation?

16:56.306 --> 16:59.267
Later. Right now, I'm taking what I want.

17:02.229 --> 17:04.689
You look beautiful tonight.

17:40.893 --> 17:46.731
I'll have my driver to pick you up tomorrow
and I'll show you my Miami.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.250
Now.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.171
Right on time.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.641
Should I do it, Timer?

18:29.483 --> 18:31.359
Morning, sir.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.862
Yeah.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.786
Hey.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.746
- Hey, let him play.
- Hey, baby.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.248
- Come on.
Kind of young...

18:45.415 --> 18:48.042
to be riding this bus alone, aren't you?
Stop it.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.878
- What? Not good enough for you?
Come on, young one.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.713
Don't move over. I wanna play.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.507
Come on, baby.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.176
Come on.
Stop. Leave me alone.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.636
Come on now, what's up, huh?

19:06.979 --> 19:08.813
Come on, baby. Don't be shy.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.357
Here, why don't you take my seat?

19:12.401 --> 19:13.985
Thank you.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.530
Yo, check her out, man.

19:20.617 --> 19:21.659
That seat's taken.

19:21.827 --> 19:24.203
Quit it. Ah!
- Fuck you.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.707
- Excuse me?
- Fuck you.

19:27.875 --> 19:29.417
Come on.

19:29.751 --> 19:30.960
It's all right.

19:34.965 --> 19:37.091
Hold these, please.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.676
Give it back to her.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.469
Stop.

19:46.602 --> 19:47.768
Hey.

19:49.813 --> 19:51.898
What's going on?

19:52.774 --> 19:53.774
You asshole!

19:53.942 --> 19:55.026
Stop that!

20:01.200 --> 20:02.658
You're dead.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.917
I hate knives.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.091
Fuck you, you son of a... Oh!

20:35.817 --> 20:38.236
I believe there's a vacancy.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.610
- So, what do you drink?
- Martini.

21:21.321 --> 21:25.533
Martini on the rocks.
Gold tequila, straight up.

21:27.286 --> 21:29.328
No one knows Miami like I do.

21:31.206 --> 21:33.582
You like spending the day with me?

21:33.750 --> 21:35.126
Yeah.

21:36.586 --> 21:39.005
- Do you?
- Mm-hm.

21:39.172 --> 21:41.841
- Kiss me.
- Hardly know you.

21:47.389 --> 21:50.057
Wait till you try spending the night.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.278
Thanks.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.465
Stay here. I gotta take care of something.

22:23.550 --> 22:25.343
Got a light?

22:32.434 --> 22:34.643
Is this that piece of shit? Hmm?

22:46.656 --> 22:49.033
Where were you?
- I was home.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.121
Thanks.

23:12.641 --> 23:14.642
Thanks, amigo.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.527
What happened to you?

23:24.986 --> 23:28.114
- I just didn't like the show, that's all.
- Uh-huh.

23:28.448 --> 23:30.324
You don't...

23:30.492 --> 23:32.410
walk away from me...

23:33.995 --> 23:35.371
ever.

23:36.164 --> 23:37.706
You understand?

23:38.458 --> 23:39.500
Sorry.

23:41.503 --> 23:43.671
- Get in the car.
- Sure.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.654
Every time...

24:09.322 --> 24:11.574
he touches me, I...

24:13.076 --> 24:16.495
I mean,
he's the man who shot my father.

24:16.663 --> 24:18.205
And he's...

24:20.459 --> 24:23.043
kissing me and...

24:26.756 --> 24:28.716
You don't have to do it.

24:28.884 --> 24:32.720
It's the only way I can get
close enough to kill him.

24:37.058 --> 24:39.894
See, I have this dream.

24:40.061 --> 24:42.980
I'm right there when it happens.

24:43.315 --> 24:47.193
He looks at me like I'm a stranger.

24:47.360 --> 24:49.653
Then I say my name.

24:50.989 --> 24:55.618
And it's the last thing he ever hears.

24:56.328 --> 24:57.661
They don't suspect you?

24:57.829 --> 25:00.789
I'm trusted, for the moment.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.085
He's with you all the time. How do you live?

25:05.253 --> 25:06.795
Alone.

25:07.964 --> 25:09.632
That's not what I mean.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.092
How do you live...

25:12.761 --> 25:13.761
with yourself?

25:13.929 --> 25:15.930
How do you?

26:32.674 --> 26:34.341
Hey, you.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.053
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

26:41.349 --> 26:42.516
You think you know me?

26:43.476 --> 26:46.186
I asked you a question.
You think you know me?

26:47.188 --> 26:50.190
Because the way you're looking at me,
we must be old friends.

26:50.358 --> 26:52.484
Where did we meet?

26:52.652 --> 26:56.030
Nowhere.

26:57.365 --> 26:59.366
You like the bitch? Huh?

27:06.166 --> 27:08.000
Maybe you like me.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.712
No, I don't like you.

27:13.882 --> 27:16.342
Then don't stare so hard.

27:16.509 --> 27:18.969
Somebody could...

27:20.055 --> 27:21.430
put something in your eye.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.403
Fucking pervert.

27:44.913 --> 27:46.789
Let's move it.

28:03.264 --> 28:05.015
Good night.

28:09.729 --> 28:11.438
- Adrian.
- Mm.

29:27.390 --> 29:30.517
- Yeah.
Are you listening?

29:32.520 --> 29:33.729
First rule:

29:34.063 --> 29:36.857
Don't go near them again.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.984
Second rule:

29:39.152 --> 29:40.903
Don't contact me.

29:41.070 --> 29:44.406
- I'll contact you.
- Maybe I can help you.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.784
- Let me see...
- No.

29:46.951 --> 29:49.495
They're my problem now and I'm theirs.

29:53.082 --> 29:55.209
Are you close enough to walk over?

30:03.885 --> 30:05.886
Rule three:

30:06.846 --> 30:08.388
If this is a setup...

30:09.265 --> 30:11.767
I kill you.

30:49.430 --> 30:51.849
- Hey, Manny.
- Now what?

30:52.016 --> 30:54.935
I'm serious. That cop was a regular.
Juanita's moving in on me.

30:55.103 --> 30:58.480
Get the hell out of here.
I don't solve domestic problems.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.357
Asshole.

31:22.964 --> 31:24.923
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

31:26.301 --> 31:28.468
Lucky me.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.377
Hey, Charlie.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.187
The word is, Manny...

32:20.355 --> 32:21.480
you're skimming.

32:22.523 --> 32:26.693
Somebody's lying.
Hey, hey, I never took a dollar.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.862
I hope it ain't you.

32:29.322 --> 32:32.282
Because if you're trying
to screw Joe Leon...

32:32.450 --> 32:36.703
Charlie, you've known me,
what, 10 years?

32:37.372 --> 32:39.873
- Hey, I'm clean.
- Good.

32:40.249 --> 32:42.209
Very good.

32:42.543 --> 32:45.128
Then you have nothing to worry about,
do you?

32:47.048 --> 32:48.173
Let me see the books.

33:18.621 --> 33:21.415
I can't take this anymore.
That is it. What?

33:21.582 --> 33:24.376
- How about a drink?
- Sure.

33:28.256 --> 33:29.297
September's missing.

33:31.050 --> 33:33.010
See you, Manny.

33:45.314 --> 33:46.732
What do you feel like doing?

33:58.786 --> 34:00.203
What?

34:00.371 --> 34:02.122
I'm working here.

34:02.290 --> 34:03.790
You have two fucking hours.

34:21.641 --> 34:23.143
Get another job, kid.

34:36.032 --> 34:39.493
They got two bodies in there.
Something that used to be Charlie...

34:39.659 --> 34:41.703
and a clean hit
on your brothel manager.

34:41.871 --> 34:42.954
That was a bright move.

34:43.121 --> 34:45.581
Something you ordered
and didn't tell me about?

34:45.750 --> 34:46.792
He was a thief.

34:47.293 --> 34:49.210
- Tell me about the bomb.
Very clean.

34:49.670 --> 34:52.255
There was no damage
to the left or right of the blast.

34:52.422 --> 34:55.509
The item that was used to set it off
was impacted inside the C4...

34:55.676 --> 34:58.553
so the arming device was vaporized.
Brilliant, professional.

34:58.721 --> 35:00.180
Gotta be a specialist.

35:00.556 --> 35:02.682
- This guy is good, Joe.
- Yeah, okay.

35:02.850 --> 35:06.228
He could put a bomb in your crab shell
you wouldn't even know it.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.314
I'll kill the son of a bitch.

35:09.482 --> 35:13.068
You can't kill anybody,
Tomayo, until we know who he is, can you?

35:14.237 --> 35:15.570
I'll find him.

35:15.738 --> 35:18.573
The important thing to find out,
who he works for.

35:19.408 --> 35:20.700
Maybe he works for the CIA.

35:20.868 --> 35:23.537
Maybe he works for the Mafia,
the Italians, I don't know...

35:23.704 --> 35:26.039
but we have to find out who, okay?

35:26.207 --> 35:27.207
Overview, Joe.

35:28.042 --> 35:31.002
We have to ask ourselves
what does eliminating Charlie mean...

35:31.170 --> 35:32.879
in the overall picture?
- Nothing.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.465
Less than nothing.
So this target wasn't territorial.

35:35.883 --> 35:36.925
It was personal.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.345
How the fuck do you know so much?

35:40.513 --> 35:44.224
He's guessing, Pop. Let me take a couple
of the boys, I'll find out who this is.

35:44.392 --> 35:47.435
Wait a minute. Give me a second here.
I have to make a decision.

35:49.230 --> 35:52.107
Little time to think here, huh?

35:55.069 --> 35:57.112
Okay.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.530
You take over, okay?

35:59.448 --> 36:03.118
- Papa...
- I said, Trent will handle it, okay?

36:03.286 --> 36:05.495
- I don't hear you saying "okay. "
- Okay, Papa.

36:05.663 --> 36:07.080
- What did you say?
- Okay, Papa.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.249
That's nice. Thank you.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.842
I'm gonna need resources
on this one, Joe.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.595
And also, the place was crawling
with cops.

36:21.762 --> 36:24.848
I can't be tripping over fucking
civil servants every move I make.

36:25.016 --> 36:28.602
- I need total control.
- Yeah, okay, well, I will...

36:28.769 --> 36:31.646
I will take care of that, you know?

36:34.942 --> 36:38.028
Personally. Okay?

38:00.111 --> 38:02.070
Hello, Timer.

38:02.655 --> 38:04.823
Having a good day?

38:09.912 --> 38:13.331
Here you go. Knock yourself out.

38:47.450 --> 38:49.576
I saw it on the news.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.245
You got the first one.

38:52.413 --> 38:53.663
Thank you.

38:54.290 --> 38:57.751
- Thank you.
Well, I'm just doing my job.

38:57.918 --> 39:00.628
- You gotta stay away from the other two.
I could help you.

39:00.796 --> 39:03.006
I could set them up for you.

39:03.174 --> 39:06.176
No, no.
You just stay away from those guys.

39:06.719 --> 39:09.804
Their future is about to become very dark.

39:09.972 --> 39:14.434
You're still following me. Aren't you?

39:15.936 --> 39:18.688
- It's gotten so I can feel you.
It's all part of the work.

39:20.066 --> 39:21.608
Do you think about me?

39:21.776 --> 39:23.902
I think about you.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.154
My own personal ghost.

39:27.239 --> 39:28.365
Or angel maybe.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.077
- We could meet.
You are a beautiful woman.

39:32.787 --> 39:33.953
But I don't meet.

39:34.121 --> 39:37.957
- When this is over, I should leave.
When are you gonna do it?

39:38.751 --> 39:39.959
Soon.

39:40.127 --> 39:42.212
Very soon.

39:48.302 --> 39:50.261
Trent, you know the chief of police.

39:50.429 --> 39:52.764
Trent is gonna work with us
on this problem.

39:52.932 --> 39:57.310
You know,
I mean, he was a former employee of the...

39:57.478 --> 39:58.978
CIA.

39:59.146 --> 40:03.483
And he is an explosives expert
and I think he can be a big help.

40:03.651 --> 40:04.651
I don't know.

40:04.819 --> 40:07.987
This has become very public,
I'm sure you wanna keep a low profile.

40:09.448 --> 40:11.366
Yeah, please.

40:11.534 --> 40:14.411
It'd be hard for Ned to go unnoticed,
if you know what I mean.

40:15.496 --> 40:19.207
Well, you know, I think there's more
involved here than keeping a low profile.

40:22.002 --> 40:26.297
I say that I'm the one you can trust,
which is the main word here, Joe. Trust.

40:26.465 --> 40:29.509
- To take him out clean.
- Our bomb boys are some of the best.

40:29.677 --> 40:31.845
Really, chief? Well, I hope that's true.

40:32.012 --> 40:35.515
They'd better be fucking magicians
because this is one very impressive man.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.016
What are you, a fucking fan?

40:37.518 --> 40:40.562
Okay, come on now.
Stop that, this is serious, right?

40:40.729 --> 40:42.147
Don't you two start.

40:43.023 --> 40:46.276
We're here to find a way to protect
the business. Don't forget that.

40:46.694 --> 40:48.862
Is that understood?

40:49.530 --> 40:54.534
Okay, chief, I have tell you
that this one is not negotiable.

40:54.702 --> 40:58.163
Look, Joe, I'll do what I can.
Put him on as a fed or something.

41:05.212 --> 41:06.379
- Joe.
- Take care.

41:06.547 --> 41:08.882
Chief, always a pleasure.

41:09.049 --> 41:11.718
Hey, chief, good to see you again.
Hey, Tomas.

41:11.886 --> 41:13.636
See you, Papa.

41:14.889 --> 41:18.349
Okay, Danny, here, help me up.

41:18.976 --> 41:21.561
I hate that deep couch.

41:23.439 --> 41:27.859
Okay. Now, listen.
Danny, you'll do me a favor.

41:28.027 --> 41:30.904
You do your best to make
this thing look official.

41:31.405 --> 41:34.532
No, please. You do that,
and I promise you...

41:34.700 --> 41:36.701
I will not forget you.

41:36.869 --> 41:37.952
Okay?

41:40.372 --> 41:41.748
Danny.

41:43.959 --> 41:46.169
A man's gotta eat, no? Heh.

42:01.477 --> 42:05.939
Hey, Gonzales, wait up.
I wanna show you those files.

42:07.566 --> 42:10.026
Hey, sport, where's the bomb squad?

42:20.663 --> 42:24.040
Hey, come on, boys and girls.
What are we doing here? Let's look alive.

42:24.458 --> 42:27.335
- What've you got?
- We're into everyone at the party...

42:27.503 --> 42:29.504
doing a complete background check, okay?

42:31.465 --> 42:32.924
Give me the next one, all right?

42:43.644 --> 42:48.731
Tell you what, I'll handle the biographies.
You go back to tracing C4. Okay, ace?

42:50.985 --> 42:53.444
Chief says you're on this. Fine.

42:53.988 --> 42:58.157
But I don't take orders from
any ex-anything. All right, ace?

42:59.868 --> 43:02.996
I gotta tell you something.
I'm sorry, I thought your chief said...

43:03.163 --> 43:05.832
that the fullest cooperation
would be forthcoming.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.334
And I gotta tell you something, sport.

43:08.502 --> 43:10.878
This doesn't feel like full cooperation
to me.

43:11.046 --> 43:13.715
I mean, look at this shit here.
What is this? This is...

43:13.882 --> 43:16.843
Shouldn't this be in the lock-up?
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong.

43:17.011 --> 43:20.013
You guys are the experts.
Maybe you don't need me.

43:20.180 --> 43:22.890
I mean, like, what is this? This is...

43:24.059 --> 43:25.101
This is Semtex.

43:25.269 --> 43:27.437
Am I right? Plastique.

43:27.605 --> 43:30.732
Plastic explosive. Am I right?
I don't know, you're the expert.

43:30.899 --> 43:34.068
This bit could blow up
this whole area, and if this area goes...

43:34.236 --> 43:36.362
the whole building could go up.
Am I right?

43:36.739 --> 43:38.197
Gosh, I don't know. I mean...

43:39.116 --> 43:41.242
maybe if I put this in here...

43:43.245 --> 43:45.038
What else do we have here? Oh.

43:45.205 --> 43:49.292
This is a plunger detonator, am I right?
And that's a little mini receiver.

43:49.752 --> 43:53.630
This looks like American circuitry to me.
And I gotta tell you, call me a patriot...

43:53.797 --> 43:57.258
but American craftsmanship
it's the greatest in the world.

43:57.426 --> 44:00.637
See? Watch this. Here we go.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.513
Let's just see.

44:02.681 --> 44:07.644
Yup. Perfect fit, first time,
every time. Screw it on.

44:08.103 --> 44:09.479
And one little twist.

44:09.647 --> 44:14.233
And voilà . A perfect receiver bomb.

44:14.401 --> 44:15.985
Which of course is...

44:16.153 --> 44:18.738
absolutely worthless without a...

44:19.615 --> 44:21.741
transmitter.

44:23.077 --> 44:24.827
But hey.

44:29.416 --> 44:31.668
Twenty seconds and we're hot.

44:32.586 --> 44:34.045
Okay?

44:34.213 --> 44:37.256
Okay. Now you deactivate it,
you sanctimonious prick.

44:37.424 --> 44:40.051
- Okay, you cut that shit, Trent.
- Oh, yeah. Huh?

44:40.219 --> 44:42.428
- Come on. Come on.
- Okay, you made your point.

44:42.596 --> 44:44.514
Have I? Huh?

44:44.682 --> 44:46.516
That's enough.
What do you mean?

44:46.684 --> 44:49.894
You think I give a shit if this whole
fucking block goes up? I don't.

44:50.062 --> 44:52.605
Maybe you've had enough.
Isn't that what you're saying?

44:52.773 --> 44:55.066
Yes, that's what I'm saying.
Enough is enough!

44:55.234 --> 44:57.110
- I can't do it.
- Twelve.

44:57.277 --> 44:59.404
What the hell,
are you crazy or something?

44:59.571 --> 45:02.407
I'm the craziest person
you'll ever meet in your life.

45:03.659 --> 45:06.411
Six, five...

45:06.578 --> 45:09.622
four, three.
- Please.

45:19.550 --> 45:21.217
Now, here's a tip.

45:21.385 --> 45:23.594
You take care of the shit work.

45:24.054 --> 45:27.890
And you leave the folks
at the party to me. Okay?

45:28.058 --> 45:30.226
We on the same page here?

45:32.855 --> 45:34.313
Ace.

46:13.854 --> 46:15.938
How do you like it? Those go upstairs.

46:16.106 --> 46:18.357
I like where I live.

46:19.401 --> 46:21.068
I like you where I live.

46:22.029 --> 46:23.488
Thanks.

46:24.198 --> 46:26.699
Close the doors. Get out.

46:40.464 --> 46:41.923
Better than what you're used to?

46:42.382 --> 46:44.383
You know, the next time you order a hit...

46:44.551 --> 46:47.386
you might wanna consider
taking out your decorator.

46:51.642 --> 46:53.726
You like to live dangerously, don't you?

46:54.561 --> 46:56.979
A little danger never killed anybody.

46:57.147 --> 46:58.773
Right, baby?

47:00.025 --> 47:02.109
Sometimes.

47:15.707 --> 47:17.208
You know...

47:17.376 --> 47:19.669
when I look at you...

47:20.921 --> 47:24.048
I see something I like very much.

47:25.133 --> 47:26.175
You know what it is?

47:26.718 --> 47:29.220
I'm breathless with anticipation.

47:30.472 --> 47:31.722
I see me.

47:44.903 --> 47:46.654
Let's get this shit over with.

48:08.552 --> 48:09.844
Wait a minute.

48:11.263 --> 48:13.347
You're the Mob's accountant, Bill.

48:13.515 --> 48:15.641
Is that all you've got for me?

48:15.809 --> 48:19.812
No, no. I have something else for you.

48:25.152 --> 48:26.485
See you guys. Peace.

48:26.653 --> 48:30.573
Don't touch that! It could be a bomb.

48:32.910 --> 48:35.036
Very funny.

49:46.066 --> 49:48.192
Son of a bitch.

50:05.335 --> 50:06.419
Hey, kid.

50:08.755 --> 50:10.923
Look at the way you parked
my fucking car.

50:12.884 --> 50:15.302
Sir, I didn't park your car.

50:16.847 --> 50:19.265
Sorry. I'll get it for you.

50:57.846 --> 50:59.805
Here's your tip.

52:30.730 --> 52:33.566
Keep
everybody back. Everybody back, please.

52:36.570 --> 52:39.613
- Some ride that must've been.
Black and white coming. Let them in.

52:39.781 --> 52:41.574
Is this the decoy?

52:42.325 --> 52:44.493
Who the fuck was this supposed to fool?

52:46.580 --> 52:49.456
- Any witnesses?
- Over there.

52:49.708 --> 52:51.792
The kid?

52:52.294 --> 52:54.003
Here you go.

52:55.630 --> 52:57.590
Nice one, Ray.

52:58.091 --> 52:59.884
Clever boy.

53:05.098 --> 53:06.140
Everybody back.

53:08.602 --> 53:10.644
"Bye-bye. "

53:11.104 --> 53:13.397
Well, at least he hasn't lost
his sense of humor.

53:19.112 --> 53:20.946
Who gave you permission to smile?

53:21.615 --> 53:22.907
Shut up.

53:46.973 --> 53:49.475
Quite a step up for you, isn't it?

53:49.643 --> 53:52.144
Depends on how you look at it.

53:52.312 --> 53:55.564
- Look, Ned, Tomas is on his way...
- Shut up.

53:55.732 --> 53:58.192
Who are you? Hmm?

53:58.360 --> 54:00.069
I said, who are you?

54:00.612 --> 54:01.820
Who are you? Huh?

54:01.988 --> 54:05.157
I'll tell you who you are. You are nobody.

54:05.325 --> 54:08.327
I created Adrian Hastings.
I got you inside.

54:08.495 --> 54:11.705
You work for me. And please
don't you ever fucking forget it.

54:13.917 --> 54:16.502
Now, you're supposed to have him
out in the open by now.

54:16.670 --> 54:18.837
You get your three corpses,
I get Ray Quick.

54:19.005 --> 54:21.757
That was the bargain.
What happened, May?

54:21.925 --> 54:24.718
I can't keep him on the line
long enough to get a trace.

54:24.886 --> 54:26.512
He doesn't wanna take a meeting.

54:27.347 --> 54:29.890
What do you want me to do, Ned?
Wish him out of hiding?

54:30.058 --> 54:31.934
Maybe you're in over your head on this.

54:32.102 --> 54:34.812
Maybe you've outlived your usefulness.
Is that possible?

54:34.980 --> 54:36.647
Listen, to me, Ned, you need me.

54:37.607 --> 54:39.817
I studied him, I drew him out.

54:41.528 --> 54:44.947
It was my voice, it was my ads.
He trusts me.

54:45.824 --> 54:47.533
Why do I need you, May?

54:47.951 --> 54:51.036
Why don't I just grab him
before he brings Tomas down?

54:51.204 --> 54:53.122
Why do you even need...

54:53.290 --> 54:54.707
to live at all, May?

54:54.874 --> 54:59.253
Because maybe he's not interested in
a big-mouth, hotshot asshole like you, Ned.

55:02.257 --> 55:05.301
You know what I've always loved
about you, May?

55:06.511 --> 55:08.262
It's not just this...

55:08.430 --> 55:10.222
poetry.

55:12.058 --> 55:13.851
It's your heart.

55:14.561 --> 55:17.479
It's the heart you bring to your work.

55:17.981 --> 55:20.316
But I promise,
if you don't get him to a meeting...

55:20.483 --> 55:22.443
before he drops the third target...

55:22.610 --> 55:25.321
you will pray for a lifetime
of Tomas's attentions...

55:25.488 --> 55:27.740
his delicate touch.

55:27.907 --> 55:30.242
- I promise.
- Don't touch me, Ned.

55:30.410 --> 55:31.452
I'm sorry.

55:35.707 --> 55:38.000
I've always wondered, May...

55:39.085 --> 55:41.045
what was it like...

55:42.297 --> 55:44.590
after you watched your parents die.

55:44.758 --> 55:46.800
Did you go over to the bed?

55:47.761 --> 55:50.846
Did little May hug them?

55:51.222 --> 55:53.766
Did you try to shake them awake?

55:55.185 --> 55:56.602
How much blood?

55:56.770 --> 55:59.188
I'm just curious, was there...

56:00.357 --> 56:02.274
a lot of blood, May?

56:02.442 --> 56:04.443
Don't push me, Ned.

56:22.170 --> 56:25.964
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Take it easy, hotshot.

56:26.132 --> 56:27.758
I'm just checking up on you.

56:27.926 --> 56:30.636
I don't need you goddamn
babysitting for me, Trent.

56:31.596 --> 56:33.806
Why aren't you out
looking for who's hitting us?

56:33.973 --> 56:36.058
- That's great, Tomas.
- What's the first move?

56:36.226 --> 56:37.434
Door-to-door search?

56:37.644 --> 56:39.353
I'm sick of you.

56:40.647 --> 56:42.439
My father thinks he needs you.

56:43.233 --> 56:45.109
When he finds out he doesn't...

56:45.276 --> 56:46.610
you're mine.

56:50.073 --> 56:52.533
I feel threatened.
- You are threatened.

58:15.742 --> 58:17.451
Tommy, Miguel, you in?
- I'm in, boss.

58:17.619 --> 58:19.161
- Me too.
Come on.

58:19.329 --> 58:21.121
Get it together.

58:21.289 --> 58:23.081
Five hundred.

58:33.426 --> 58:35.636
Okay, I'm out of here.

59:40.702 --> 59:42.035
Just a second.

59:45.540 --> 59:46.873
May Munro.

59:51.504 --> 59:53.422
Come on!

59:57.760 --> 01:00:00.345
Where are you going?
- Come on! Get up!

01:00:00.513 --> 01:00:03.265
Go in there! Get him!
Get the fuck in there!

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:05.976
Get back.

01:00:07.353 --> 01:00:09.187
Keep them back.

01:00:11.983 --> 01:00:13.025
Come on, get them out!

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:15.736
Get them out!

01:00:20.992 --> 01:00:22.784
Good one, Ray.

01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:24.870
Really good.

01:01:11.250 --> 01:01:13.168
Joe, I am so sorry.

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:25.138
You're sorry?

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.685
My son...

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:34.272
is in a closed casket...

01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:40.195
and you are sorry.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:43.949
Well, I hold you responsible.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:45.867
He wouldn't lay low.

01:01:46.327 --> 01:01:47.869
What'd you say?

01:01:50.998 --> 01:01:52.457
I said, he wouldn't lay low.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:57.129
Are you trying to tell me
that was his fault now?

01:01:57.296 --> 01:01:58.296
That's the way it was.

01:01:58.464 --> 01:02:02.175
The way it was?
You were supposed to protect his back.

01:02:02.343 --> 01:02:04.344
His life was in your hands.

01:02:04.512 --> 01:02:06.304
You know what you do?

01:02:06.472 --> 01:02:09.516
You cut my heart out, you know.

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:12.728
And now you look, my...

01:02:15.148 --> 01:02:16.982
My son...

01:02:17.775 --> 01:02:20.277
is lying in a box.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:21.987
- Joe, I...
- And you know...

01:02:22.155 --> 01:02:24.156
you were the one...

01:02:24.323 --> 01:02:25.782
who let it happen.

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:30.162
- Joe, you're not thinking straight.
- Jesus Christ, don't you try to tell me.

01:02:30.329 --> 01:02:32.372
I swear to God, don't say another word.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.583
Not another word. I'll kill you here.

01:02:34.751 --> 01:02:37.836
You understand? Hmm?

01:02:47.221 --> 01:02:48.722
Now...

01:02:49.682 --> 01:02:54.311
you go out...

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:59.274
you go out and you find
this explosives expert...

01:02:59.442 --> 01:03:00.734
and you...

01:03:01.569 --> 01:03:04.362
bring him to me alive...

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:07.407
before I bury Tomas.

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:32.075
"Adrian Hastings. Miami.
Services 3 p.m., Friday.

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:33.618
San Juan De Bosco. "

01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:35.412
Too bad, May.

01:04:39.667 --> 01:04:42.043
Her body's in cold storage
at County General.

01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:47.132
How does this sound?

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.635
"Lonely, needy, deeply hurt.
Will be discreet. "

01:04:50.803 --> 01:04:53.471
Story of my life.

01:04:55.308 --> 01:04:58.310
Yeah. So get this on every major
bulletin board service.

01:04:58.477 --> 01:05:00.896
Put the response
through a long-distance exchange...

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:03.982
and be ready to trace. Okay?
- Okay.

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:38.391
Guys like this,
they're not gonna advertise.

01:05:38.559 --> 01:05:41.853
You gotta draw them out.
So just do your best.

01:05:44.357 --> 01:05:46.608
Hi, baby. Are you wearing any underwear?

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:47.817
Could you send it to me?

01:05:47.985 --> 01:05:51.237
- Get rid of this asshole.
- Yeah, well, I don't think your experience...

01:05:51.405 --> 01:05:53.365
matches my needs.
- Get rid of him.

01:05:53.532 --> 01:05:54.908
That's what I'm doing.

01:05:55.868 --> 01:05:59.412
We've had 30 calls and nothing.
I don't know if this makes any sense.

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.832
You know what? I'll decide if it makes
any sense or not, okay?

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.460
Go on, take it. Take it.

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:07.462
Line five and...

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.422
- Go.
- Hello?

01:06:09.757 --> 01:06:12.217
Calling about the ad, right?

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:15.887
Yeah.

01:06:16.889 --> 01:06:18.723
Right.

01:06:18.891 --> 01:06:20.558
I thought you were someone else.

01:06:21.894 --> 01:06:24.312
The ad was similar to others.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.649
Yeah, well, give me a number
because I can't talk on this phone.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:28.858
No. Forget it.

01:06:29.026 --> 01:06:31.027
You have a message from May.

01:06:31.195 --> 01:06:33.530
I've got a message...

01:06:33.698 --> 01:06:34.948
from May.

01:06:36.575 --> 01:06:38.451
- Who is this?
- She's okay.

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.328
She wants to meet you.

01:06:41.205 --> 01:06:42.747
No, I don't think so.

01:06:46.961 --> 01:06:48.670
Put Trent on the line.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:49.879
What did you say?

01:06:50.047 --> 01:06:52.882
Trent should be standing next to you.
I wanna talk to him.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:56.386
Put him on the line.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:01.641
Hey, Ned, can you hear me?

01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:05.020
Come on, talk to me.
Come on, talk to me, Ned.

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:06.688
New playmates know what kind of man...

01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.149
they're dealing with?
Why the agency fired you? Huh?

01:07:10.317 --> 01:07:13.278
That killing people, pulling the trigger
was like jerking off?

01:07:13.446 --> 01:07:17.032
Watching bloody bodies going
though the air is what gets you off.

01:07:17.199 --> 01:07:19.451
- Come on, talk to me, Ned.
- I need time.

01:07:19.618 --> 01:07:23.621
When you crawl into your hole all alone,
and you are alone, aren't you, big guy?

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:25.498
Tell me what burns you the most.

01:07:26.375 --> 01:07:28.918
Losing your job as a CIA attack dog...

01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:32.589
or knowing that I turned you in
and I'm still alive?

01:07:32.757 --> 01:07:34.424
Come on, talk to me.

01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:38.636
You sell your service to the highest bidder,
won't you, you stinking maggot.

01:07:38.804 --> 01:07:42.807
Fuck you, Ray! Fuck you! You killed!

01:07:42.975 --> 01:07:44.059
Your bombs!

01:07:44.226 --> 01:07:47.979
How many? Ten? Fifty?
A hundred before you lost count?

01:07:48.147 --> 01:07:52.650
It was your bombs on the bridge in BogotÃ¡.
Your bomb in the cabana.

01:07:52.818 --> 01:07:55.612
But you're getting sloppy, Ray.
You broke your famous code.

01:07:56.072 --> 01:08:00.283
You killed an innocent bystander, Ray.
It is just eating you up inside, isn't it?

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:03.661
Well, you were always
too fucking sensitive. But guess what.

01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:07.165
I'm coming, Ray.
I'm coming to take all the pain away.

01:08:07.333 --> 01:08:09.334
I'm gonna fucking cut it
right out of you...

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.544
and I'm gonna close your heart
in my hand.

01:08:11.712 --> 01:08:14.506
I'm right behind you and I know you.
I know you.

01:08:14.673 --> 01:08:19.010
You've got no mercy.
You got no fucking loyalty.

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:20.553
And you got no code.

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:24.015
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch...
- Hey, time's up, 58 seconds.

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:27.727
Ray. Ray. God... Wait.

01:08:28.562 --> 01:08:30.814
Goddamn it! Son of a bitch!

01:08:30.981 --> 01:08:33.483
I'll fucking kill you! I'll vaporize your ass!

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:35.693
What're you looking at?

01:08:38.697 --> 01:08:40.365
Turn around!

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:48.747
Nobody...

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:50.959
says a word.

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.587
Now you tell me that you got a trace.

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:57.381
Just tell me.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.341
He jumped off before we locked him.

01:08:59.510 --> 01:09:00.926
- Okay.
- We got a partial trace.

01:09:01.095 --> 01:09:02.761
Shut up.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.957
She gave of herself...

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.751
for 40 years.

01:09:33.919 --> 01:09:36.671
She dedicated her life...

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.381
generously...

01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:40.633
courageously...

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:43.803
to all of us,
Cuban orphans everywhere.

01:09:45.930 --> 01:09:47.432
She has shown us the road.

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.853
For the wages sin pays is death.

01:09:52.604 --> 01:09:55.023
But the gift God gives...

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.900
is everlasting life...

01:09:57.067 --> 01:09:59.569
by Christ, Jesus, our Lord.

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:04.717
So how did I look?

01:11:43.048 --> 01:11:44.215
Why did you do this?

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:47.051
I wanted to meet you.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:52.724
I wanted to know if you were
everything I thought you'd be.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:54.892
Nobody ever is.

01:12:20.502 --> 01:12:21.669
Hold it.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:25.381
Open the casket.

01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:30.094
- Who are you?
- I said, open the fucking casket.

01:12:39.563 --> 01:12:42.523
Bitch. Fuck.

01:13:15.724 --> 01:13:17.725
We shouldn't be here.

01:13:17.893 --> 01:13:19.644
Not if we wanna stay alive.

01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:21.771
Is it worth it?

01:13:22.606 --> 01:13:24.357
I think so.

01:13:28.195 --> 01:13:29.695
I hope so.

01:13:52.261 --> 01:13:54.011
Let me see this beautiful face.

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:15.486
- Why'd you leave me to think I killed you?
- It was the only way...

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:18.781
I could get Tomas's men off my back.
- Wanna give me details?

01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:22.910
Poor lady OD'd in the emergency room.

01:16:24.204 --> 01:16:28.207
So I dropped my wallet in her purse
and here I am.

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:32.837
That's pretty good, especially...

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:35.339
if you're an amateur.

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:39.969
You could've been killed.

01:16:40.554 --> 01:16:42.930
I had to be there when he died.

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.640
I needed to see it.

01:16:48.186 --> 01:16:50.187
Anyway...

01:16:51.898 --> 01:16:55.151
I knew you'd pick
the safest route for everybody.

01:16:55.569 --> 01:16:57.820
I've studied your style.

01:16:59.197 --> 01:17:01.699
I know you always focused
your detonation.

01:17:06.121 --> 01:17:07.997
So I knew...

01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:13.711
that if I was facing Tomas,
right in front of him, like this...

01:17:14.504 --> 01:17:17.256
A little bit closer, like this...

01:17:20.927 --> 01:17:23.596
I knew I'd feel safe.

01:17:32.689 --> 01:17:35.608
Ahem. Excuse me.
Police are looking for these two people.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:39.820
If you happen to see them,
call the number on the back, okay?

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:41.906
Hey, wait.

01:17:42.074 --> 01:17:44.241
I have seen them.

01:18:29.621 --> 01:18:30.788
- Back from the dead.
- Ned.

01:18:32.165 --> 01:18:34.709
Jesus. Thank God.

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:37.420
You know, I was just going to call you.

01:18:37.587 --> 01:18:40.798
About the funeral thing,
look, I'm sorry, there's just...

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:43.384
You know,
it was the only way to really draw him out.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:48.806
It worked. I don't have to tell you.
I used the attachment thing and I got him.

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:51.809
Couldn't stay away from me. So?

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:54.061
I just wanna get
one thing straight here, May.

01:18:54.229 --> 01:18:58.107
- Yeah.
- You did all this to deliver him to me?

01:18:58.275 --> 01:18:59.567
Uh-huh.

01:19:00.026 --> 01:19:02.862
Ned, we had a deal.
I hold up my end of a deal.

01:19:03.363 --> 01:19:05.322
You're a classic, May.

01:19:05.490 --> 01:19:07.241
- Now, where is he?
- He's here.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:08.743
- Where?
- He's in the hotel.

01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:12.455
- I know he's in the hotel. Where?
- Well, I got a key. I think it...

01:19:12.622 --> 01:19:15.124
- This key?
- No, no, no.

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:17.752
Yeah. This key?

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:20.296
God, look, I mean, I do have a key.

01:19:20.464 --> 01:19:21.714
Ned, he's on a high floor.

01:19:21.882 --> 01:19:24.383
- I think it's 10 or it's 11.
- Take her to the car.

01:19:24.551 --> 01:19:26.719
- Go on.
- I left my purse in the room, Ned.

01:19:26.887 --> 01:19:30.222
- Shut up. Take her to the car.
- Ned, I have a couple of things I have...

01:19:30.390 --> 01:19:34.310
Stop yanking me around.
All right, all right.

01:19:35.395 --> 01:19:37.855
Oh, Harry, you've gotta be kidding.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:40.191
You're so adorable. No.

01:19:40.358 --> 01:19:43.444
He made me so nervous.
Look, it'll take me one second.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:45.571
Where can I go?

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.073
Great.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:53.996
Harry, listen...

01:19:54.581 --> 01:19:57.875
- Harry, she'll call you back.
Hey.

01:19:58.293 --> 01:19:59.418
Give me my phone.

01:20:04.007 --> 01:20:05.257
Room 1205.

01:20:16.686 --> 01:20:19.605
- Yeah.
- Leon's men are on their way up.

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:21.816
You set me up.

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:23.317
- Why?
- I did not.

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:48.425
Come on, hit it. Okay, let's go, get out.
Come on, there's a fire. Let's go. Rush.

01:20:48.593 --> 01:20:50.052
Come on, come on.

01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:54.139
Where you going? Use the stairs. This
one's full. Get out of here. Get a new shirt.

01:21:34.806 --> 01:21:37.725
We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:42.730
Please check the number and dial again
or call your operator to help you.

01:21:49.195 --> 01:21:52.323
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

01:21:52.490 --> 01:21:55.910
If you need help,
hang up and then dial your operator.

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:09.965
If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.

01:22:10.133 --> 01:22:13.844
If you need help,
hang up and then dial your operator.

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:15.888
No!

01:22:24.564 --> 01:22:27.775
Don't move. Don't touch anything.

01:22:38.620 --> 01:22:40.537
Come on, give me your hand.

01:23:24.249 --> 01:23:26.583
Hey, what's with the lights here?
He's in here.

01:23:26.751 --> 01:23:28.335
- Security, get him.
Hey!

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:03.287
Come on, asshole. Come on.

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:33.942
Please remain calm.

01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:36.945
There's no cause for alarm or panic.

01:24:37.113 --> 01:24:40.157
There has been an accident,
but there is currently no danger...

01:24:40.325 --> 01:24:43.494
and no cause for alarm.

01:25:09.479 --> 01:25:11.188
That's her.

01:25:11.689 --> 01:25:14.650
Her who?
- That's the bitch that was banging Tomas.

01:25:14.818 --> 01:25:18.195
Her ID was faked.
Ray Quick is working for her.

01:25:22.450 --> 01:25:25.410
Alice and Stan Munro.

01:25:26.704 --> 01:25:28.247
What are you talking about?

01:25:29.249 --> 01:25:32.459
I was the kid your little boy missed
in the closet.

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:40.676
- That was a long time ago.
- Not to me.

01:25:42.303 --> 01:25:44.138
Now I understand.

01:25:44.305 --> 01:25:46.431
Now I understand. You...

01:25:46.599 --> 01:25:48.767
You think...

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:53.730
that my son Tomas gave the orders
for the killings. Yeah? Well, you are wrong.

01:25:53.898 --> 01:25:59.236
If anybody in this house has power
to give orders, it's me.

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:01.572
You understand? I give the orders.

01:26:01.739 --> 01:26:04.324
I give the orders of who is killed...

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:09.079
and who is not killed.
Is that understood?

01:26:09.247 --> 01:26:10.914
I need her, Joe...

01:26:11.082 --> 01:26:12.332
to get to Ray.

01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:16.044
I have to make one more call,
then you can have her. But I need her now.

01:26:16.713 --> 01:26:18.338
You sure?

01:26:18.923 --> 01:26:20.299
Joe, please.

01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.806
Take the bitch.

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:47.951
Show time.

01:26:50.455 --> 01:26:52.539
Hello?
- It's me.

01:26:52.957 --> 01:26:56.293
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't know
they were coming. You've gotta believe me.

01:26:56.461 --> 01:26:58.045
I'll tell you what I believe.

01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.464
I believe you're very good on the phone.

01:27:00.632 --> 01:27:02.424
Fuck.

01:27:02.967 --> 01:27:05.385
I need to see you.

01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:07.804
What, and me set up again?

01:27:07.972 --> 01:27:09.223
No, I'll pass.

01:27:10.475 --> 01:27:13.560
- I'm through taking risks.
- So that's it?

01:27:13.728 --> 01:27:16.563
We just walk away? Forever?

01:27:16.731 --> 01:27:19.107
It's safer for everybody.

01:27:21.986 --> 01:27:25.239
Come on, Ray, I don't know
what this relationship is about...

01:27:25.406 --> 01:27:28.116
but there's one thing I know,
it's not based on safety.

01:27:28.284 --> 01:27:31.036
You're too much of an unknown.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:35.207
Adrian Hastings, May Munro.
Who the hell are you?

01:27:37.835 --> 01:27:40.963
- Do you remember the Fontainebleau?
- I remember.

01:27:43.508 --> 01:27:45.968
Do you remember touching me, Ray?

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:49.805
Do you remember my voice?

01:27:50.598 --> 01:27:53.016
Not over the phone...

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:56.520
but carried on breath.

01:27:58.064 --> 01:27:59.106
On you.

01:28:00.733 --> 01:28:02.526
Near you.

01:28:04.779 --> 01:28:06.863
Close enough to feel.

01:28:07.031 --> 01:28:08.490
Why are you saying this to me?

01:28:10.201 --> 01:28:12.327
Because I have to.

01:28:14.038 --> 01:28:15.205
Come on, Ray.

01:28:16.749 --> 01:28:18.834
You gotta see me.

01:28:19.544 --> 01:28:20.585
Please?

01:28:22.046 --> 01:28:23.380
Please, baby?

01:28:33.558 --> 01:28:36.143
Double M Seafood, right now.

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:39.896
All right. And Ray?

01:28:40.648 --> 01:28:41.982
I'm here.

01:28:42.150 --> 01:28:44.735
Do you remember the note
our relationship ended on?

01:28:45.611 --> 01:28:48.071
The last thing I said to you?

01:28:48.781 --> 01:28:49.906
I remember everything.

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.242
I meant every word.

01:29:16.267 --> 01:29:17.559
You're going in alone, May.

01:29:18.269 --> 01:29:23.315
You know, if this is a trap,
I promise you, you're gonna die.

01:29:23.483 --> 01:29:24.900
But if he's in there...

01:29:25.068 --> 01:29:27.486
I want you to make him
feel safe and secure.

01:29:28.154 --> 01:29:31.782
And I'll be listening on this microphone.

01:29:31.949 --> 01:29:34.951
The second I hear his voice, we move in.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:36.411
You understand?

01:29:36.746 --> 01:29:38.538
Now get out of the fucking car.

01:29:56.099 --> 01:30:00.060
This is all over, I could see us spending
some time together again.

01:30:00.645 --> 01:30:05.982
You know, you wash
the stink of Tomas and Ray off you...

01:30:06.442 --> 01:30:08.819
you might clean up pretty good.

01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:19.204
Go ahead.

01:30:20.331 --> 01:30:22.833
And then you can go in
and get him yourself.

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:24.668
I don't give a shit.

01:30:27.338 --> 01:30:29.297
Go on.

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:32.008
Move.

01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:41.852
If she blinks...

01:30:42.812 --> 01:30:44.020
kill her.

01:31:09.338 --> 01:31:11.548
Bad plan, Ned.

01:31:11.716 --> 01:31:13.633
That's it, boys, we got him. Move in.

01:31:37.492 --> 01:31:39.367
Go! Go, you chicken shits!

01:31:39.535 --> 01:31:42.871
What, you think he's gonna top that?
Get in there!

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:45.916
Watch the river!
Watch the river and the side streets.

01:31:46.083 --> 01:31:48.001
Fucking crabs. Nice one, Raymond.

01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:55.800
Assholes, watch the river.
Where are you, Raymond?

01:31:56.886 --> 01:31:59.179
All right, side one!

01:32:19.575 --> 01:32:21.952
What, and me set up again? No, I'll pass.

01:32:23.329 --> 01:32:24.538
What's that?

01:32:24.705 --> 01:32:26.540
Break it down.

01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:30.627
Air brakes.

01:32:30.795 --> 01:32:32.128
It's safer for everybody.

01:32:32.296 --> 01:32:34.839
Complex sound, slightly muffled.

01:32:35.007 --> 01:32:38.009
People talking, clamping down steps.

01:32:39.303 --> 01:32:40.637
A clapping shut.

01:32:41.347 --> 01:32:44.224
Voices, mechanical sounds.

01:32:44.392 --> 01:32:47.894
- A hiss.
- People getting off a bus. Yes. Yes.

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:51.982
You have to have an overview. It's people
getting off a bus. Are these on both tapes?

01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:53.775
- Yes.
- Yes, I knew it. Okay, buses.

01:32:53.943 --> 01:32:56.653
We gotta have bus routes.
What do we have? Okay.

01:32:56.821 --> 01:33:00.574
He uses pay phones,
but he gets there by bus.

01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:03.326
Oh, Ray, you're always so precise.

01:33:03.494 --> 01:33:06.788
Let's say, he gets on a bus
wherever he lives and he...

01:33:06.956 --> 01:33:10.250
...goes in both directions. Right?
Good counter-surveillance technique.

01:33:10.418 --> 01:33:13.878
He takes the bus 20 to 25 minutes
in each direction. So we have...

01:33:14.213 --> 01:33:15.505
- Come on, come on.
Four.

01:33:15.673 --> 01:33:17.465
Four, four and four.

01:33:17.633 --> 01:33:19.551
Here we go, triangulation.

01:33:19.719 --> 01:33:23.930
Three routes, that's it. Bingo. Okay, we
wanna have checks in five-minute intervals.

01:33:24.098 --> 01:33:25.682
- Right?
- How about the restaurants?

01:33:25.850 --> 01:33:28.602
- Restaurants?
- He's gotta eat sometime.

01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:32.731
Try to remember. He would've gotten off
the bus, bought cigarettes.

01:33:32.898 --> 01:33:34.858
- Look at that face. Come on.
- I told you...

01:33:35.026 --> 01:33:37.444
we have a lot of regular customers.
He ain't one.

01:33:37.612 --> 01:33:41.031
- Look at that face again. Come on.
- Nothing.

01:33:41.991 --> 01:33:43.116
Hey, Henry.

01:33:44.994 --> 01:33:47.537
I forgot to tell you, we deliver.

01:34:07.266 --> 01:34:09.059
Now, there's a vision.

01:34:14.398 --> 01:34:15.899
Good morning, stranger.

01:34:17.109 --> 01:34:18.818
I gotta go.

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:22.197
Where? I think we already wore out
our welcome at the Hilton.

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.830
I wanna stay with you.

01:34:32.458 --> 01:34:36.503
But it's not over for me.
Joe Leon ordered the hit.

01:34:37.546 --> 01:34:39.589
Let me get this right.

01:34:41.258 --> 01:34:44.302
You think that killing Joe Leon
is gonna make everything all right?

01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:46.429
Something has to.

01:34:48.766 --> 01:34:53.395
You did the job. I'm not asking
for your help. I'll take care of it. I owe him.

01:34:53.562 --> 01:34:55.021
No.

01:34:55.439 --> 01:34:56.981
You owe her.

01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:02.278
Her. A whole life. Come here.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.865
Come here.

01:35:13.999 --> 01:35:18.169
Put all this behind you now
or the past is gonna eat you alive.

01:35:18.337 --> 01:35:20.755
I know what I'm talking about.

01:35:24.510 --> 01:35:26.469
I have to go.

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:28.638
Wish me luck.

01:35:28.806 --> 01:35:30.849
No.

01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:41.651
Come here. You're not going.

01:36:26.572 --> 01:36:29.741
Detonation sequence primed. Enter code.

01:36:29.909 --> 01:36:30.950
Top of the world, Mom.

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:34.120
Controlled.

01:36:34.288 --> 01:36:35.622
One, two, three.

01:36:45.925 --> 01:36:47.300
I'm afraid to ask.

01:36:47.468 --> 01:36:50.929
This is rigged for controlled explosion
if the inner perimeter is breached.

01:36:51.096 --> 01:36:54.933
Each one of these lights is a pressure-mine
sequence. If one goes, they all go.

01:36:55.267 --> 01:36:56.559
- Where are they?
- Everywhere.

01:36:56.727 --> 01:37:00.438
But don't worry, they're not armed yet.
But if these lights turn red, worry.

01:37:10.282 --> 01:37:12.367
This is good. Nice sneak attack.

01:37:12.535 --> 01:37:16.746
Do not approach
the warehouse. Perimeter is armed.

01:37:16.914 --> 01:37:19.165
Please, cut the bullshit.

01:37:25.631 --> 01:37:27.841
That's a good one. I taught him that.

01:37:30.177 --> 01:37:32.929
Nice sense of irony,
blowing up the Bomb Disposal unit.

01:37:33.097 --> 01:37:34.180
Nice work, Ray.

01:37:35.599 --> 01:37:36.766
Warning.

01:37:36.934 --> 01:37:39.811
Gunfire will automatically
detonate B20s...

01:37:39.979 --> 01:37:42.981
sufficient to destroy two square miles.

01:37:45.818 --> 01:37:47.068
Go, go, go! To the left!

01:37:47.236 --> 01:37:48.945
Give me that.

01:37:50.698 --> 01:37:55.201
Listen up. Anybody shoots,
anybody shoots, and I shoot them.

01:37:56.245 --> 01:37:59.622
This whole place is wired
and I'm gonna take him alive. You got that?

01:38:05.129 --> 01:38:06.296
Move back!

01:38:06.463 --> 01:38:07.964
Look out.

01:38:09.550 --> 01:38:11.426
Air unit, stand by.

01:38:11.969 --> 01:38:13.136
Oh, that's new.

01:38:13.304 --> 01:38:15.179
How's that feel, ace?

01:38:16.307 --> 01:38:18.933
Don't shoot. Go.

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:21.311
Fuck this amateur hour.

01:38:21.478 --> 01:38:24.439
Bravo Unit One, back up Three.
Sorry.

01:38:31.739 --> 01:38:33.072
You're crazy.

01:38:39.663 --> 01:38:42.665
All the highly trained professionals
in the world...

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:47.921
all the hardware...

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:50.506
all the technology and what do you got?

01:38:51.508 --> 01:38:53.343
Nothing.

01:38:53.844 --> 01:38:56.012
You gotta do everything yourself.

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:59.015
And why?

01:39:00.225 --> 01:39:02.894
You can't get good help these days.

01:39:04.188 --> 01:39:06.105
Side 5, report in.

01:39:07.775 --> 01:39:08.816
On command...

01:39:17.159 --> 01:39:20.203
Sir, we have a problem
with possible booby traps...

01:39:29.046 --> 01:39:31.422
A surprise for you, Ray.

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:36.552
Inner perimeter breech, Ray.

01:39:37.054 --> 01:39:38.596
Right. It's set. Let's go.

01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:47.146
- Final destruction sequence initiated.
- Don't move.

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:49.732
- I'll lead you through the pressure pads.
Evacuate.

01:39:49.900 --> 01:39:51.067
Ray?

01:39:53.404 --> 01:39:55.655
I'm sorry. Should I have knocked?

01:39:58.867 --> 01:40:00.159
All right, Ray.

01:40:01.495 --> 01:40:02.578
You lose, I win.

01:40:05.082 --> 01:40:08.668
She's hot, Ray.
Semtex, sprayed with nitro.

01:40:09.086 --> 01:40:12.255
Cigarette case. Honest Injun, take a look.

01:40:13.757 --> 01:40:15.425
Just a peek, no touch.

01:40:21.015 --> 01:40:26.394
And May, you might ask yourself,
"Why is today my time to die?"

01:40:30.357 --> 01:40:33.109
Take it out. Slowly.

01:40:34.236 --> 01:40:36.112
Slowly.

01:40:37.614 --> 01:40:38.948
Open it up.

01:40:41.577 --> 01:40:44.203
Everybody deserves to die.

01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:48.374
Ask God. He kills across the board.

01:40:50.502 --> 01:40:52.128
So why shouldn't I?

01:40:53.672 --> 01:40:55.006
Bye.

01:40:56.425 --> 01:41:00.386
And here's a tip I learned from you, Ray.
It's a focused detonation. Only she blows.

01:41:00.554 --> 01:41:02.722
- It's pretty nifty, huh?
- Don't move it.

01:41:02.890 --> 01:41:05.683
The mercury switch.
Any change in attitude or altitude, it goes.

01:41:05.851 --> 01:41:07.643
Got it.

01:41:07.811 --> 01:41:09.937
Anyway, Ray, she's dead already.
What I need...

01:41:10.105 --> 01:41:13.566
what I need is to take you alive
because, you see, my boss...

01:41:13.734 --> 01:41:15.902
he wants to look in your eyes
when you die.

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:18.071
- Okay?
- Sick fuck.

01:41:18.614 --> 01:41:19.947
I'm touched, really.

01:41:20.115 --> 01:41:21.616
What happened to us, Ray?

01:41:23.494 --> 01:41:25.119
We were...

01:41:26.121 --> 01:41:27.246
We were good together.

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:31.793
You were the rigger and I was the trigger.

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:37.006
You shouldn't have taken me down.

01:41:37.174 --> 01:41:39.759
Because now, you fuck.

01:41:42.471 --> 01:41:45.890
I see you're still into
the old memories, Ray.

01:41:46.975 --> 01:41:49.685
Well, that's what always does you in,
you know, memories.

01:41:49.853 --> 01:41:52.063
It's that trying to save the innocent.

01:41:53.148 --> 01:41:55.316
You know your problem, Ray?

01:41:56.443 --> 01:41:57.693
You're too sentimental.

01:41:57.861 --> 01:42:00.530
There's nothing wrong
with being sentimental.

01:42:01.532 --> 01:42:04.200
Sometimes you could save your ass.

01:42:07.704 --> 01:42:10.498
Here's a tip: No fail-safe.

01:42:10.666 --> 01:42:11.958
Pressure pads.

01:42:19.591 --> 01:42:22.093
Thirty seconds to total destruction.

01:42:22.261 --> 01:42:26.013
All right. Now, slide it to me.

01:42:30.894 --> 01:42:33.187
Twenty-five seconds.

01:42:33.355 --> 01:42:36.440
It's all right. Just do it, May.

01:42:36.608 --> 01:42:38.151
Slide your hands out.

01:42:39.736 --> 01:42:40.736
Twenty seconds.

01:42:45.784 --> 01:42:48.536
Now get the hell out of here.
Straight down the right side.

01:42:48.704 --> 01:42:50.746
Not without you.

01:42:51.331 --> 01:42:53.833
- Fifteen seconds.
- I'm right behind you.

01:42:58.797 --> 01:43:01.090
Ten seconds.

01:43:04.428 --> 01:43:05.678
Oh, no!

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:09.557
- Five seconds.
Come on! Come on!

01:43:11.768 --> 01:43:13.186
Three seconds.

01:43:52.851 --> 01:43:54.185
Come on!

01:44:35.018 --> 01:44:36.686
Thank you.

01:44:46.863 --> 01:44:49.865
You are a kind God.

01:44:51.034 --> 01:44:52.827
Thank you.

01:45:18.061 --> 01:45:19.562
You bastarda!

01:45:32.409 --> 01:45:35.244
- How do you feel?
- Better.

01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:59.795
