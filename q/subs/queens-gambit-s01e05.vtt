00:06.416 --> 00:08.166
[Alice] Dark's nothing to be afraid of.

00:08.666 --> 00:12.125
In fact, I'd go as far as saying
there's nothing to be afraid of.

00:12.208 --> 00:13.208
Anywhere.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.375
The strongest person is the person
who isn't scared to be alone.

00:20.708 --> 00:23.416
It's other people you got to worry about.

00:24.250 --> 00:27.750
Other people. They'll tell you what to do,
how to feel… [scoffs]

00:29.083 --> 00:30.041
Before you know it…

00:30.666 --> 00:33.708
[scoffs] …you're pouring your life out
in search of something

00:34.250 --> 00:36.166
other people told you to go look for.

00:37.375 --> 00:39.375
Someday, you're gonna be all alone,

00:40.333 --> 00:43.041
so you need to figure out
how to take care of yourself.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.458

Hello.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.083
[man] Beth Harmon?

02:38.791 --> 02:39.958
Yes.

02:40.041 --> 02:43.958
Uh, this is Harry Beltik.
Uh, from the Kentucky State Tournament.

02:44.708 --> 02:46.458
No, I remember.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.541
I hear you dropped one to Borgov.

02:50.208 --> 02:51.750
I wanted to give condolences.

02:52.750 --> 02:53.583
Thanks.

02:54.916 --> 02:56.375
What were you playing, white?

02:57.958 --> 03:00.583
-Black.
-Oh, it's-it's better that way.

03:01.250 --> 03:02.708
I mean, if you're gonna lose.

03:03.291 --> 03:04.125
Suppose so.

03:05.458 --> 03:06.375
What did you play?

03:08.416 --> 03:09.375
Closed Sicilian.

03:09.458 --> 03:10.500
Rossolimo? Really?

03:10.583 --> 03:11.791
I let him do it to me.

03:11.875 --> 03:12.833
That's a mistake.

03:12.916 --> 03:17.541
Uh, look, I'm in Lexington for the summer,
and I thought maybe…

03:18.458 --> 03:19.375
Maybe what?

03:20.375 --> 03:21.916
Would you like some training?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.083
I-I know…
I know you're better than me.

03:25.666 --> 03:28.375
But if you're gonna play the Soviets,
you need help.

03:29.041 --> 03:29.916
Where are you?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.500
I'm on my way to the Phoenix Hotel.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.541
I’m moving to an apartment on Thursday.
I could come by then.

03:38.666 --> 03:40.250
Why don't you come over right now?

03:41.916 --> 03:43.541
[car approaching]

03:51.333 --> 03:52.166

04:17.208 --> 04:18.750
Excuse me, miss.

04:21.416 --> 04:24.458
What happened to that gawky kid
who kicked my ass five years ago?

04:24.541 --> 04:25.625
[chuckles]

04:28.083 --> 04:29.375
Apparently, she grew up.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.583
A.I. Deinkopf.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.166
Middlegame Strategy.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.250
I've read that one.

04:45.333 --> 04:47.500
J.R. Capablanca, My Chess Career.

04:48.500 --> 04:49.583
That one, too.

04:53.833 --> 04:57.333
Fornaut, Alekhine's Games 1938 to 1945.

04:57.416 --> 04:58.250
Yes.

05:01.291 --> 05:02.833
Meyer, Rook and Pawn Endings.

05:03.666 --> 05:05.916
I know, you've read it.

05:06.000 --> 05:06.833
No.

05:09.125 --> 05:10.625
But I have my own copy upstairs.

05:11.916 --> 05:14.500
Well, some of these
are gonna be new to you.

05:14.583 --> 05:16.208
Capablanca played on intuition.

05:16.291 --> 05:19.750
And his natural gifts,
which obviously were considerable.

05:19.833 --> 05:22.458
Unlike Bogoljubov and Grünfeld,
who memorized everything.

05:22.541 --> 05:24.583
Yeah, I know how you feel about them.

05:24.666 --> 05:26.375
I read your piece in Chess Review.

05:27.708 --> 05:29.583
Nice cover photo, by the way.

05:33.125 --> 05:36.125
I see players at tournaments
after their games have finished,

05:36.666 --> 05:38.958
sitting there studying opening variation

05:39.041 --> 05:42.125
or middle-game strategy, endgame theory.

05:42.208 --> 05:45.375
-Like it would have made a difference.
-You don't ever study?

05:45.458 --> 05:47.000
I analyze games.

05:47.750 --> 05:50.041
What actually happened,
not what could have happened.

05:51.041 --> 05:53.041
-And I play it by ear.
-Like Capablanca.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.500
-He would have beaten Borgov.
-Mmm, not every game.

05:55.583 --> 05:57.208
Mmm, every game that counted.

05:57.291 --> 05:59.291
[both chuckle softly]

06:00.166 --> 06:02.791
-You think I'm a prima donna, don't you?
-It's chess.

06:04.708 --> 06:05.958
We're all prima donnas.

06:07.458 --> 06:10.708
So, I've replayed your match
with Benny Watts a dozen times now.

06:11.500 --> 06:12.333
Why?

06:13.166 --> 06:15.833
-That's ancient history.
-Well, it's not that ancient.

06:17.166 --> 06:19.291
-I'm a different player now.
-In some ways.

06:20.750 --> 06:21.750
[Beltik chuckles]

06:21.833 --> 06:24.041
You're stubborn, so you get mad.

06:24.125 --> 06:26.375
When that happens,
you can only see what's in front of you.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.000
Anger clears my head.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.708
Anger is a potent spice.

06:30.916 --> 06:33.416
A pinch wakes you up,
too much dulls your senses.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.333
Where'd you get that from,
a fortune cookie?

06:35.416 --> 06:37.541
Mrs. Grecco, my second grade teacher.

06:37.625 --> 06:38.916
-Ah.
-Mm.

06:39.791 --> 06:42.458
But the point is still valid.
You've got to stay open.

06:43.416 --> 06:46.291
If you get locked into one idea,
like this king knight pawn, say,

06:46.375 --> 06:47.208
it's death.

06:48.666 --> 06:49.500
Look.

06:54.666 --> 06:58.166
-Now, the knight pawn is pinned.
-So?

06:58.250 --> 07:01.000
So you got to move the king now,
or you get stuck later.

07:02.958 --> 07:04.083
I can see that, but--

07:04.166 --> 07:06.458
But look at the queen-side pawns,
way over here.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.250
-He could do this.
-Try it.

07:32.875 --> 07:33.708
See?

07:35.458 --> 07:36.541
It's a good sequence.

07:37.208 --> 07:38.291
It’s from Alekhine.

07:39.833 --> 07:41.625
I'm saying I got it from a book.

07:41.708 --> 07:43.083
I know what you're saying.

07:43.708 --> 07:45.291
[chuckles] Let's eat.

07:50.541 --> 07:53.416
You're not the same person
you were five years ago, either.

07:54.166 --> 07:55.750
-No?
-No.

07:56.541 --> 07:58.291
But I can't figure out what's different.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.583
Um, I've become more profound?

08:01.666 --> 08:02.500
That's not it.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.083
And I, um, got my teeth fixed.

08:10.250 --> 08:12.333
-Yeah, that's it.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.291
It's the teeth. It was driving me crazy.

08:16.500 --> 08:17.875
I used my tuition money.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.291
My parents are plenty ticked off about it.

08:25.458 --> 08:26.291
It was worth it.

08:32.875 --> 08:35.250
[clears throat] Uh, I should go.

08:36.375 --> 08:37.958
Uh, I'll leave my board here.

08:39.541 --> 08:40.416
I'll take this.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.750
I'll be back in the morning
with more books.

09:35.291 --> 09:36.166

09:36.750 --> 09:38.166

09:38.250 --> 09:40.333
[man on TV]
What seems to be the trouble?

09:40.875 --> 09:44.708
[woman] Well, it's difficult to show you
the symptoms at the moment, because…

09:45.416 --> 09:47.083
it comes and it goes.

09:47.791 --> 09:51.625
[man] Oh, it comes and goes?

09:51.708 --> 09:54.083
[woman] Yes, it's so unfortunate.

09:54.166 --> 09:56.375
It's always the same
whenever I see a doctor.

09:56.458 --> 09:59.291
When… when I come, it goes,

09:59.375 --> 10:00.958
and when I go, it comes.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.375
Okay, tell me, what was your endgame?

10:10.208 --> 10:11.208
You just saw it.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.375
What was your plan?

10:13.458 --> 10:15.333
To beat you?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.833
-I don't know what it was.
-Exactly, you're still just improvising.

10:19.916 --> 10:22.000
I just wiped you out five times.

10:23.875 --> 10:24.875
I'm a master,

10:24.958 --> 10:26.958
and I've never played better in my life.

10:27.041 --> 10:27.916
[Beth chuckles]

10:28.000 --> 10:29.166
So modest.

10:29.250 --> 10:31.375
But I'm nowhere close
to what you'll face in Paris.

10:31.458 --> 10:33.666
I could beat Borgov
with a little more work.

10:33.750 --> 10:36.291
You can beat Borgov with a lot more work.

10:36.375 --> 10:37.666
Years more work.

10:38.291 --> 10:40.625
Borgov's not some
Kentucky ex-champion like me.

10:40.708 --> 10:42.541
He is a world champion

10:42.625 --> 10:44.958
who could have beaten
both of us when he was ten.

10:46.958 --> 10:48.375
Do you even know his career?

10:49.291 --> 10:50.333
No.

10:50.416 --> 10:51.250
Well…

10:54.375 --> 10:55.208
Read it.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.416
Read the games from Leningrad, 1962.

10:58.500 --> 11:00.541
Look at the way he plays
rook-pawn endings.

11:00.625 --> 11:03.208
Look at the games
with Luchenko and Spassky.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.208
You might learn something.

11:13.041 --> 11:14.916
No, this way.

11:20.791 --> 11:21.750
[whispering] Right.

"Look at the games

Botvinnik should have taken
the pawn with the queen. [chuckles]

You could move in here if you want.
You know, for free.

16:05.833 --> 16:06.666
Really?

16:06.750 --> 16:07.916
Yeah. [chuckles softly]

16:09.208 --> 16:10.041
Really.

16:20.291 --> 16:21.125
[kisses gently]

16:25.125 --> 16:25.958
Um…

16:27.625 --> 16:30.625
-Sorry, I…
-Uh… no. No.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.875
-[exhales] Um…
-I-I just wasn't ready. [laughs awkwardly]

16:39.833 --> 16:40.666
I'm ready now.

16:48.166 --> 16:49.125
Now or never.

16:53.416 --> 16:54.500
[light switch clicks]

16:58.708 --> 16:59.541
[lighter clicks]

17:10.000 --> 17:10.958
[blows slowly]

17:21.166 --> 17:22.416
So, um…

17:23.583 --> 17:25.750
should I stay here or go back to my room?

17:28.750 --> 17:29.666
Whatever you want.

17:37.041 --> 17:37.875
Okay.

17:39.416 --> 17:40.708
[blows softly]

17:50.416 --> 17:51.250
Good night.

17:52.166 --> 17:53.000
Good night.

17:58.333 --> 17:59.500
[door creaks shut]

17:59.583 --> 18:01.583
[Muzak playing over speakers]

18:07.083 --> 18:09.083
-[stroller rattling]
-[baby cooing]

18:12.208 --> 18:13.041
[woman] Beth?

18:13.666 --> 18:14.625
Beth Harmon?

18:17.125 --> 18:18.166
Margaret Neil.

18:18.250 --> 18:20.166
Well, Margaret Johnson now.
[chuckles]

18:20.875 --> 18:21.750
Fairfield High?

18:22.583 --> 18:24.375
[baby cooing]

18:24.458 --> 18:27.208
Margaret. [chuckles awkwardly]
Right. Hi.

18:27.291 --> 18:30.166
Mike and I tied the knot
right after graduation.

18:31.041 --> 18:32.375
Congratulations.

18:32.458 --> 18:35.333
Not long after,
we were blessed with this little one.

18:36.041 --> 18:37.083
What's her name?

18:37.166 --> 18:39.416
Jean, after Mike's grandmother.

18:40.958 --> 18:42.125
I read about you.

18:42.708 --> 18:44.708
The chess and the traveling.

18:45.583 --> 18:46.875
It must be exciting.

18:46.958 --> 18:47.791
It is.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.583
Being around all those boys
is a real thrill.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.375
You wanted to know
what the boys were like,

18:56.458 --> 18:57.708
if I dated any of them.

18:59.708 --> 19:03.375
That time I came over to your house
with the Apple Pis.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.583
Oh! [laughing] Gosh!

19:06.458 --> 19:07.416
That seems, uh…

19:08.791 --> 19:10.416
like a million years ago, doesn't it?

19:10.500 --> 19:11.625
[baby cooing]

19:12.125 --> 19:13.375
[Margaret sighs]

19:14.333 --> 19:17.583
I should probably get my errands done,
before this one gets…

19:18.250 --> 19:21.708
really fussy,
and the window of opportunity,

19:21.791 --> 19:23.666
as we like to say, slams shut.

19:25.916 --> 19:27.166
It was nice to see you.

19:28.291 --> 19:29.125
You, too.

19:29.750 --> 19:31.916
[Beltik]
I think there's more to life than chess.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.458
Yeah, one of my heroes is Philidor.

19:35.166 --> 19:38.041
This French musician,
used to play chess blindfolded

19:38.125 --> 19:39.500
in Paris and London.

19:39.583 --> 19:41.416
Diderot wrote him a letter.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.625
Now, you know Diderot?

19:43.458 --> 19:44.375
French Revolution?

19:44.458 --> 19:45.666
Yeah, it's close enough.

19:46.416 --> 19:49.750
So, uh, Philidor was doing
blindfold exhibitions

19:49.833 --> 19:51.458
and burning out his brain,

19:51.541 --> 19:55.041
or whatever it was they thought you did
in the 18th century. Anyway…

19:55.125 --> 19:58.541
Diderot wrote to him
and said something like,

19:59.083 --> 20:03.416
"It's foolish to run the risk
of going mad for vanity's sake."

20:04.000 --> 20:06.250
Now, I think about that sometimes,

20:06.333 --> 20:09.041
when I'm analyzing my ass off
over a chess board.

20:13.916 --> 20:14.875
[dishes clattering]

20:15.500 --> 20:18.708
I, um… I saw your picture
on the cover of Chess Review,

20:18.791 --> 20:21.250
and those pictures
Townes took in Las Vegas,

20:21.875 --> 20:23.333
for the Lexington paper.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.333
They were beautiful.

20:27.958 --> 20:30.666
-I thought maybe the two of you were--
-No, we weren't.

20:34.958 --> 20:35.791
Truth is…

20:36.833 --> 20:38.750
I was waiting for you to come back.

20:41.166 --> 20:42.500
You're why I got my teeth fixed.

20:42.583 --> 20:45.958
Didn't Koltanowski
use to play blindfolded all the time?

20:47.583 --> 20:48.583
And he wasn't crazy.

20:53.458 --> 20:55.375
No, no, no, he's-he's not. It was, um…

20:56.458 --> 20:58.666
It was Morphy who went crazy,
and Steinitz.

20:59.708 --> 21:02.166
Morphy thought
people were trying to steal his shoes.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.375
[Beth chuckles]

21:03.458 --> 21:06.666
Well, maybe he thought
shoes were bishops. [chuckles awkwardly]

21:08.416 --> 21:09.541
Yeah, maybe.

21:14.208 --> 21:15.041
Beth?

21:19.666 --> 21:20.541
Let's play chess.

21:22.375 --> 21:23.208
Okay.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.625
[bell jingles]

21:26.000 --> 21:28.500
[sports commentator
speaking indistinctly on radio]

21:31.125 --> 21:32.875
Two packs of Chesterfields, please.

21:42.208 --> 21:43.041
This, too.

21:45.416 --> 21:47.583
[register slides and dings]

21:48.416 --> 21:50.375
Sure you wouldn't rather just steal it?

21:50.458 --> 21:52.583
[coins clinking]

21:54.041 --> 21:55.000
You gonna be there?

21:55.833 --> 21:56.666
That tournament?

21:59.458 --> 22:00.458
Yes.

22:01.666 --> 22:02.500
Good luck.

22:05.708 --> 22:06.541
Keep it.

22:09.083 --> 22:10.333
For the first time.

22:11.458 --> 22:12.333
[bell jingles]

22:12.958 --> 22:15.625
[Beltik] Whoa, that doesn't look right.
Your knight is hanging.

22:15.708 --> 22:16.541
[Beth] Mm-mm.

22:16.625 --> 22:19.541
You're missing it.
It's a much stronger move than it looks.

22:21.625 --> 22:22.500
Okay, watch.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.750
The knight takes,

22:25.250 --> 22:26.666
and the pawn moves up.

22:28.125 --> 22:30.708
If he didn't move it up,
the bishop would be locked in.

22:30.791 --> 22:33.250
When he does…

22:33.875 --> 22:34.875
[mimics explosion]

22:35.833 --> 22:37.000
…the other pawn falls.

22:38.291 --> 22:40.458
-What about the other bishop here?
-For Christ's sakes.

22:40.541 --> 22:42.583
It's check once the pawn moves,
and the knight trades.

22:43.375 --> 22:44.333
Can't you see that?

22:45.791 --> 22:49.000
-No, I can't. I can't find it that fast.
-Well, wish you could.

22:50.333 --> 22:51.291
[sighs]

22:52.666 --> 22:54.208
You're too sharp for me.

22:58.125 --> 23:00.958
[door opens and closes]

23:01.041 --> 23:03.041
[jazz music playing loudly on radio]

23:14.291 --> 23:15.541
[clears throat]

23:27.125 --> 23:28.625
[jazz music continues faintly]

23:34.291 --> 23:35.416
[music stops abruptly]

23:58.583 --> 23:59.416
Hey.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.250
[sighs] Breakfast is almost ready.

24:09.291 --> 24:11.208
I have taught you everything I know.

24:12.791 --> 24:14.916
Which, admittedly, is not a lot.
[chuckles]

24:16.750 --> 24:18.333
I've got to start studying.

24:18.916 --> 24:22.291
I'm supposed to be an electrical engineer,
not a chess bum.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.333
Where are you gonna go?

24:27.666 --> 24:29.125
I'm moving to that apartment.

24:31.250 --> 24:32.958
It's closer to the university.

24:39.583 --> 24:41.791
-I'm gonna leave you--
-You're wrong, you know.

24:42.708 --> 24:43.916
You've taught me a lot.

24:45.708 --> 24:46.958
I'm really glad you called.

24:47.583 --> 24:50.250
I'm glad I could be here with you,
you know?

24:51.583 --> 24:52.791
After you lost your mom.

24:53.791 --> 24:54.833
It's more than that.

24:58.083 --> 24:59.291
You've really helped me.

25:00.791 --> 25:02.291
I guess you've helped me, too.

25:03.708 --> 25:05.375
You've helped me realize something.

25:06.416 --> 25:07.250
What?

25:08.791 --> 25:09.916
That I don't love chess.

25:10.958 --> 25:12.125
No, it's okay.

25:13.625 --> 25:15.875
I just don't love it
as much as I once did.

25:17.791 --> 25:20.875
I'm not obsessed with it
the way one has to be to win it all.

25:23.000 --> 25:24.208
The way you are.

25:26.541 --> 25:28.041
I'm gonna leave you…

25:30.250 --> 25:31.083
this.

25:33.166 --> 25:34.416
You have a lot in common.

25:35.708 --> 25:36.708
[Beth] Really?

25:36.791 --> 25:40.166
Morphy was a lawyer or something,
in New Orleans.

25:40.250 --> 25:41.583
You look at his games,

25:42.458 --> 25:43.416
the way he played.

25:44.625 --> 25:48.333
He sacrificed knights and bishops
like he had a dozen instead of two,

25:49.208 --> 25:52.500
and then he'd move in on the king so fast,
his opponents would just freeze up.

25:54.375 --> 25:57.625
It's too bad Morphy and Capablanca
hadn't been alive at the same time.

25:57.708 --> 25:58.958
They could've played each other.

25:59.041 --> 26:02.500
Yeah, it's too bad Morphy
fell into a muttering paranoia and died.

26:06.500 --> 26:09.208
He would stay up all night,
in Paris, before his games,

26:10.750 --> 26:14.041
drinking in cafes,
and talking with strangers.

26:15.291 --> 26:18.958
And then he'd play
the next day like a shark.

26:20.333 --> 26:23.083
Well-mannered, well-dressed,
moving the pieces

26:23.166 --> 26:26.833
with these small, ladylike hands.

26:27.541 --> 26:30.500
Crushing one European master
after another.

26:32.750 --> 26:34.250
You know what they called him?

26:36.041 --> 26:38.708
"The pride and the sorrow of chess."

26:41.083 --> 26:42.416
And then he retired at 22.

26:43.833 --> 26:46.583
-And you think that's gonna be me?
-I think that is you.

26:49.041 --> 26:49.875
I think maybe…

26:50.750 --> 26:51.833
it's always been you.

26:55.708 --> 26:57.166
[pills clatter]

27:02.958 --> 27:04.041
[bottle thuds softly]

27:08.125 --> 27:09.250
Be careful, Beth.

27:18.666 --> 27:20.666
[door opens]

27:21.500 --> 27:23.750
-[door closes]
-[melancholy music playing]

27:26.333 --> 27:27.625
[engine turns over]

27:36.583 --> 27:38.583
[indistinct conversations]

28:12.041 --> 28:14.041
[exhales slowly]

28:34.083 --> 28:36.083
[music intensifying]

28:45.750 --> 28:46.916
[man] Why, hello, Beth.

28:47.875 --> 28:49.208
[Beth] Why, hello, Benny.

28:50.875 --> 28:54.250
I read about your game with Borgov.
That must have felt terrible.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.625
-I felt like a fool.
-I know that feeling.

28:57.166 --> 28:58.000
Helpless.

28:59.125 --> 29:00.458
It all goes, and you just…

29:02.000 --> 29:03.250
push wood.

29:05.833 --> 29:07.250
Who have you got up first?

29:08.875 --> 29:09.708
Manfredi.

29:09.791 --> 29:10.625
[kisses]

29:14.291 --> 29:15.875
That shouldn't take too long.

29:16.875 --> 29:20.333
Highest-rated players
in the whole fucking country,

29:20.416 --> 29:23.041
and yet here we are
at some second-rate university,

29:23.125 --> 29:27.333
playing on cheap plastic boards
with cheap plastic pieces.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.250
If this were
a golf or tennis tournament,

29:31.333 --> 29:33.666
we'd be surrounded by reporters,
as opposed to…

29:33.750 --> 29:34.583
[man snores]

29:35.208 --> 29:36.333
…whoever these people are.

29:37.583 --> 29:39.666
You should see where
they play in the Soviet Union.

29:39.750 --> 29:41.333
I'm planning on it.

29:42.458 --> 29:43.958
You have to get past me first.

29:44.041 --> 29:45.541
I'm planning on that, too.

29:47.458 --> 29:49.666
[upbeat guitar music playing]

30:31.458 --> 30:33.083
[kings clattering]

30:33.166 --> 30:35.166
[upbeat guitar music continues]

31:38.125 --> 31:40.166
[music fades to silence]

31:40.958 --> 31:44.375
[Benny] Now, most players, they lack
the courage in their convictions.

31:44.458 --> 31:48.541
The key is to not be tentative.
You have to play with absolute confidence.

31:48.625 --> 31:49.791
I can tell, on the first move,

31:49.875 --> 31:53.875
whether someone's got that or they don't,
just from how they move that first piece.

31:54.375 --> 31:56.333
What advice would you give
to any young players

31:56.416 --> 31:58.041
who wanna follow in your footsteps?

31:58.958 --> 31:59.791
Um…

32:00.500 --> 32:02.000
I'd tell them to read my book.

32:02.958 --> 32:04.333
Obviously. Um…

32:05.250 --> 32:08.708
Yeah, play through all the games.
You know, I'd tell them to get in shape.

32:08.791 --> 32:12.541
Most people think about chess players,
they think about people who look like you.

32:12.958 --> 32:14.041
Harmon!

32:14.625 --> 32:15.458
Wait up.

32:19.083 --> 32:20.666
Found you a reporter, I see.

32:21.833 --> 32:23.208
-Funny. Ha.
-[chuckles]

32:24.458 --> 32:27.041
What did you do to that poor guy
you played in the third round?

32:27.125 --> 32:28.958
He looked like he wanted to kill himself.

32:29.458 --> 32:31.791
Uh, which poor guy are you talking about?

32:32.916 --> 32:33.750
Touché.

32:35.666 --> 32:39.666
Hey, uh, some of us have been, uh,
heading down to the student union,

32:39.750 --> 32:41.625
having a couple beers,
playing some speed chess.

32:41.708 --> 32:42.666
You should join us.

32:42.750 --> 32:44.666
No, thanks. I have to study.

32:45.291 --> 32:48.041
Thought I'd go back to the dorms,
read your book.

32:49.083 --> 32:50.250
You know, get in shape.

32:52.208 --> 32:54.541
You do realize
that we have the whole day off tomorrow?

32:56.291 --> 32:57.791
Can I ask you a question?

32:57.875 --> 32:58.708
Ooh.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.958
Depends on whether or not
the answer will give you an edge.

33:02.041 --> 33:02.875
Seriously?

33:03.833 --> 33:04.916
Are you that nervous?

33:05.583 --> 33:08.083
-Was that the question?
-No! What's with the knife?

33:09.166 --> 33:10.041
What do you mean?

33:10.791 --> 33:13.250
I mean, why do you carry it around?

Beth Harmon,
this is Danny Weiss and Dave Friedman.

34:54.333 --> 34:55.333
Nice to meet you.

34:55.416 --> 34:57.791
Actually, we met.
You beat me the other day.

34:58.875 --> 35:00.916
Me, too. Rather badly, in fact.

-Sorry.
-[Danny] Don't be.
