17:41.708 --> 17:44.791
What we want
is a statement to that effect.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.541
-To the press?
-[woman] Exactly.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.000
We had something prepared. There you go.

17:59.291 --> 18:00.708
I'm a chess player.

18:00.791 --> 18:02.916
Of course you are.
But you're also a Christian.

18:03.000 --> 18:04.458
I'm not sure about that.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.416
I have no intention
of saying anything like this.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.833
-Why not?
-Because it's fucking nonsense?

18:12.583 --> 18:16.500
Christian Crusade
has already invested a good deal of money.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.625
We paid
for your last trip to San Francisco.

18:19.708 --> 18:21.291
We were all very proud of you.

18:21.375 --> 18:26.000
And we've already spent a good deal more
on your upcoming trip to the Soviet Union.

18:26.083 --> 18:26.916
Okay.

18:28.708 --> 18:29.541
Fine.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.041
I'll give it all back.

18:38.666 --> 18:39.500
[pen clicks]

18:40.583 --> 18:41.541
[pen writing]

18:49.583 --> 18:51.666
I hope you know what you're doing, dear.

18:52.666 --> 18:54.083
[Benny] Oh, it's official now.

18:54.166 --> 18:55.000
You're crazy.

18:55.708 --> 18:57.375
You are out of your fucking mind.

18:57.458 --> 18:59.125
[Beth] Maybe. Probably.

18:59.208 --> 19:02.375
But I did it,
and it's too late to undo it.

19:02.458 --> 19:04.333
-Are the tickets paid for?
-No.

19:05.125 --> 19:06.166
Nothing's paid for.

19:06.250 --> 19:09.166
You understand you gotta pay Intourist
for the hotel in advance?

19:09.250 --> 19:10.125
I know that.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.125
I have 2,000 in my bank account.

19:13.208 --> 19:16.458
It would be more,
but I've been keeping up the house.

19:17.333 --> 19:20.625
It's gonna take a thousand more
to do it, at least that.

19:22.958 --> 19:24.708
-I was wondering--
-I don't have it.

19:25.375 --> 19:26.875
What do you mean? [blows]

19:27.458 --> 19:29.625
-You've got money.
-I don't have it.

19:30.291 --> 19:31.666
Did you gamble it all away?

19:32.916 --> 19:34.208
What difference does it make?

19:35.208 --> 19:37.875
You can call the Federation
or the State Department.

19:37.958 --> 19:40.041
The Federation doesn't like me.

19:41.125 --> 19:43.458
They think I haven't done as much
for chess as I could've.

19:43.541 --> 19:46.416
Should have gone on Tonight,
Phil Donahue…

19:48.125 --> 19:50.791
Benny, come on.
I don't wanna go to Russia by myself.

19:52.958 --> 19:54.375
[exhales slowly]

19:55.416 --> 19:56.916
-Benny?
-Are you kidding me?

19:57.875 --> 19:59.708
-What?
-First, you don't come back to New York,

19:59.791 --> 20:01.041
and you basically tell me

20:01.125 --> 20:03.125
that you'd rather be a drunk
than be with me.

20:03.875 --> 20:04.916
Now you pull this crap?

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
No, you can fucking well go alone.

20:11.458 --> 20:12.833
Maybe I shouldn't have done it.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.541
Maybe I didn't have
to give the money back.

20:15.625 --> 20:18.041
Maybe? Maybe is a loser's word, Beth.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.833
-Benny…
-Don't call me anymore.

20:21.166 --> 20:22.833
-[phone hangs up]
-[dial tone]

20:29.833 --> 20:32.500
[man on phone] What money the Federation
has comes from the magazine.

20:33.166 --> 20:35.750
Four hundred dollars
is the most we could possibly spare.

20:35.833 --> 20:37.000
[racquetball thudding]

20:40.208 --> 20:41.666
[Muzak playing through phone]

20:43.666 --> 20:45.750
-[woman] State Department, please hold.
-[inhales]

20:47.083 --> 20:49.791
-[Beth] Thought you said you could play.
-[Jolene] I said I'm learning.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.333
[Muzak playing through phone]

20:56.666 --> 20:59.333
-Cultural Affairs, O'Malley speaking.
-[Beth] Hello?

21:00.000 --> 21:02.958
[Beth screaming] Oh, my God, I won!
[squealing]

21:06.750 --> 21:08.708
[O'Malley whistles]
Three thousand dollars?

21:08.791 --> 21:10.125
[Beth] Yes, straight away.

21:10.541 --> 21:11.708
I'll see what I can do.

21:12.125 --> 21:14.333
-I'll get back to you in an hour.
-An hour?

21:14.416 --> 21:15.875
[Muzak playing through phone]

21:17.125 --> 21:18.083
[O'Malley] No dice.

21:18.666 --> 21:19.833
I'm terribly sorry.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.000
There's no way government funds
can be handed out to you

21:23.083 --> 21:24.333
without more time and approval.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.875
Don't you have some petty cash
or something?

21:28.791 --> 21:31.291
I don't need funds
to undermine the government in Moscow.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.208
I just need…

21:33.708 --> 21:35.875
money for my trip.

21:36.541 --> 21:38.416
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry,

21:39.416 --> 21:42.166
but we will be sending
one of our men with you.

21:42.791 --> 21:43.625
Keep you safe.

21:45.041 --> 21:45.958
Keep me safe?

21:46.583 --> 21:50.083
-I shouldn't have bought the house.
-Or all those dresses.

21:51.666 --> 21:53.166
Three thousand is a lot.

21:55.541 --> 21:57.333
It's expensive to go to Moscow.

22:01.250 --> 22:02.250
I'll give it to you.

22:03.541 --> 22:04.375
What?

22:06.083 --> 22:08.416
No, you just said it's a lot of money.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.875
I have it and more. I've been saving.

22:12.583 --> 22:13.958
You need it for law school.

22:15.041 --> 22:15.875
I do.

22:16.666 --> 22:18.000
And you'll give it back…

22:19.000 --> 22:19.833
when you win.

22:20.958 --> 22:21.958
What if I don't win?

22:22.916 --> 22:23.958
It's still worth it.

22:26.125 --> 22:28.000
Or you could give me the black dress.

22:29.541 --> 22:32.250
-Or the purple one. I like them both.
-[laughing]

22:38.083 --> 22:38.916
You're like…

22:41.083 --> 22:42.041
my guardian angel.

22:43.208 --> 22:45.250
For crying out loud.

22:45.333 --> 22:46.208
Hey, Beth.

22:46.958 --> 22:47.791
Fuck you.

22:48.791 --> 22:52.458
Shaibel isn't the only one
who kept after you all these years.

22:52.541 --> 22:57.000
I know how you lost to Benny Watts
in Vegas and then beat him in Ohio.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.458
I read the papers.

23:01.041 --> 23:04.666
Even on a group trip into town,
I spent my ice cream money

23:04.750 --> 23:08.208
on the damn chess magazine
had your ugly face on it.

23:10.083 --> 23:11.416
For a time,

23:12.541 --> 23:13.875
I was all you had.

23:15.583 --> 23:16.750
And for a time,

23:17.583 --> 23:19.250
you was all I had.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.666
We weren't orphans.

23:23.333 --> 23:27.000
Not as long as we had each other.
You understand what I'm saying?

23:28.625 --> 23:30.291
I'm not your guardian angel.

23:30.375 --> 23:33.625
I'm not here to save you.

23:33.708 --> 23:35.791
Hell, I can barely save me.

23:37.375 --> 23:40.041
I'm here because you need me to be here.

23:41.791 --> 23:43.125
That's what family does.

23:44.500 --> 23:45.583
That's what we are.

23:47.375 --> 23:48.958
Someday, I might need you.

23:50.041 --> 23:51.666
It's doubtful.

23:52.625 --> 23:54.125
[laughing] But you never know.

23:55.541 --> 23:57.083
But if I do…

23:58.916 --> 24:00.083
you'll come, won't you?

24:01.458 --> 24:02.541
I might.

24:04.125 --> 24:05.708
[laughs]

24:05.791 --> 24:07.541
[passengers speaking indistinctly]

24:18.791 --> 24:20.791
[liquid pouring]

24:27.000 --> 24:28.333
You been to Russia before?

24:30.916 --> 24:31.750
Have you?

24:32.750 --> 24:33.625
Once or twice.

24:37.875 --> 24:39.041
There's a few rules.

24:40.708 --> 24:44.791
One, stay in your hotel
at all times unless you're with me.

24:44.875 --> 24:48.333
Two, do not answer your door
or your phone, unless it's me.

24:48.416 --> 24:50.666
How will I know it's you
if I don't answer it?

24:51.500 --> 24:52.333
Three,

24:52.916 --> 24:53.750
no drinking.

24:55.083 --> 24:56.500
You just offered me a drink.

24:57.416 --> 24:58.625
That was a test.

25:01.041 --> 25:03.791
Let me know if any of the Russian players
tries to speak with you.

25:04.333 --> 25:06.083
In particular, Vasily Borgov.

25:06.166 --> 25:08.916
He sends a signal in any way,
or sends a note,

25:09.916 --> 25:11.333
I wanna know immediately.

25:12.291 --> 25:13.958
What exactly would a signal look like?

25:15.000 --> 25:16.166
Could be anything.

25:18.291 --> 25:21.250
-He could do it in one of your matches.
-How?

25:22.166 --> 25:23.000
I don't know.

25:23.875 --> 25:25.291
I don't play chess.

25:27.375 --> 25:28.541
Just be on the lookout.

25:29.375 --> 25:30.833
I'm told they may wanna talk.

25:32.833 --> 25:34.333
Talk about what?

25:39.875 --> 25:42.625
What part of the State Department
did you say you were from again?

25:53.250 --> 25:55.416
-[rain pattering]
-[men speaking Russian]

26:01.458 --> 26:02.291
[door closes]

26:07.208 --> 26:08.833
[man 1, in Russian]
That the chess player?

26:12.500 --> 26:14.666
She looks like Ann-Margret.

26:15.375 --> 26:16.625
[engine turns over]

26:20.291 --> 26:22.333
[man 2]
Let's hope the Russians like redheads.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.333
[man 2 speaking Russian]

26:25.041 --> 26:27.000
[anticipatory orchestral music playing]

27:12.750 --> 27:15.125
[in English]
This is definitely better than mine.

27:16.833 --> 27:18.916
Remember, stay in your room at all times.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.083
Do not leave the hotel
unless you're with me.

27:21.166 --> 27:22.250
I'll get you in the morning.

27:23.083 --> 27:25.208
Will you knock two times fast
and one time slow?

27:26.166 --> 27:27.000
Good one.

27:27.708 --> 27:28.625
Welcome to Russia.

27:29.875 --> 27:32.625
[dramatic string music playing]

27:33.708 --> 27:34.583
[door closes]

27:46.333 --> 27:47.166
Yes.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.750
This will do nicely.

27:51.291 --> 27:53.875
[in Russian]
In the words of Thomas Huxley,

27:53.958 --> 27:56.166
"The chessboard is the world,

27:56.250 --> 27:59.541
the pieces are
the phenomena of the Universe,

27:59.625 --> 28:01.000
the rules of the game

28:01.083 --> 28:03.416
are what we call the laws of Nature,

28:03.500 --> 28:06.458
and the player on the other side

28:06.541 --> 28:09.958
is hidden from us."

28:14.000 --> 28:16.791
[tournament director]
Ladies and gentlemen, dear comrades,

28:17.291 --> 28:18.708
please welcome…

Thank you.

29:43.666 --> 29:46.583
-[buttons clicking]
-[thrilling music playing]

29:51.625 --> 29:54.833
[commentator 1, in English] As far as
they knew, Harmon wasn't at their level.

29:54.916 --> 29:56.458
Someone like Laev

29:56.541 --> 29:59.208
probably didn't spend a lot of time
preparing for their match.

29:59.291 --> 30:03.083
Elizabeth Harmon's not at all
an important player by their standards.

30:03.166 --> 30:06.583
The only unusual thing about her,
really, is her sex.

30:06.666 --> 30:10.166
And even that's not unique in Russia.
There's Nona Gaprindashvili,

30:10.250 --> 30:13.916
but she's the female world champion
and has never faced men.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.666
My guess is
Laev was expecting an easy win,

30:16.750 --> 30:20.125
and not at all the 27-move thrashing
Beth Harmon just gave him.

30:29.041 --> 30:31.041

30:39.291 --> 30:42.625

32:49.541 --> 32:51.041
[Beth] Um… [chuckles]

32:52.666 --> 32:54.000
[in English] Yeah? Okay.

32:54.083 --> 32:54.916
Um…

32:56.791 --> 32:58.625
[crowd cheering loudly]

33:00.541 --> 33:04.125
[commentator 1] Beth Harmon's games
with Hellstrom and Shapkin were rigorous,

33:04.208 --> 33:07.041
and I'm sure,
for the young American, rather exhausting.

33:07.125 --> 33:10.333
But there was a solidity
to her opening moves

33:10.416 --> 33:12.625
that she was able to maintain
through the middlegame,

33:12.708 --> 33:15.041
and on to the point each of them resigned.

33:15.125 --> 33:16.875
-[opponent grunts]
-[chair clatters]

33:18.750 --> 33:21.958
[commentator 1] Hellstrom, it must
be said, clearly took it rather hard.

33:22.041 --> 33:23.750
Didn't speak to Harmon afterwards.

33:25.833 --> 33:27.833
[crowd applauding]

33:35.583 --> 33:38.083
[commentator 1] Shapkin, however,
was very decent, very civilized,

33:38.166 --> 33:39.458
and took his loss with grace,

33:39.541 --> 33:42.666
even though Harmon's win over him
was decisive and merciless.

33:55.541 --> 33:57.541

35:22.041 --> 35:24.916
[gentle piano music playing]

35:39.625 --> 35:42.000
[commentator 1, in English]
Luchenko's the oldest player here,

35:42.083 --> 35:44.416
was World Champion
before Elizabeth Harmon was born.

35:44.916 --> 35:47.875
He defeated the great Alekhine
in an exhibition when he was a boy,

35:47.958 --> 35:51.416
played to a draw with Botvinnik
and crushed Bronstein in Havana.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.000
And while he's no longer
the tiger he once was,

35:54.541 --> 35:56.875
he's a dangerous player
when allowed to attack.

35:57.583 --> 35:59.291
Harmon will have to be very careful.

36:46.208 --> 36:48.541
I don't understand.
Did we win, or did we lose?

36:49.500 --> 36:50.333
We adjourned.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.625
-Meaning?
-[crowd continues chanting "Harmon"]

36:53.708 --> 36:55.166
Meaning we didn't finish.

36:57.708 --> 36:59.333
-[car door closes]
-So, uh…

37:00.083 --> 37:01.041
when do we finish?

37:01.125 --> 37:02.750
-[engine turns over]
-Tomorrow.

37:03.583 --> 37:05.750
But right now, we really need some sleep.

37:38.458 --> 37:39.666
[pensive music playing]

37:43.416 --> 37:45.583
[man] And maybe she takes with check.

37:45.666 --> 37:46.875
[Borgov] He takes back.

37:46.958 --> 37:49.208
[man] But then she takes his rook.

37:49.875 --> 37:52.750
[Borgov] So what? He's got h5.

37:55.875 --> 37:58.333
[Luchenko] Yes, that's a nasty pin.

37:58.958 --> 38:00.166
[Borgov] And she's done.

38:04.791 --> 38:05.958
[liquid pouring]

38:19.458 --> 38:21.041
[door creaks shut]

39:04.916 --> 39:07.416
-[in English] Oh, good evening.
-Good evening.

39:21.750 --> 39:23.041
[chess clock ticking]

39:36.458 --> 39:39.041
Harmon had her 90 minutes of play,
and Luchenko had the same,

39:39.125 --> 39:41.791
along with 35 minutes
he had left from the day before.

39:59.041 --> 40:00.625
This put three things against her.

40:03.000 --> 40:04.666
Luchenko having the white pieces,

40:06.041 --> 40:07.666
his still unstopped attack…

40:09.333 --> 40:11.125
and that extra allotment of time.

40:11.208 --> 40:12.916
So, it was all the more impressive

40:13.000 --> 40:15.625
when she beat him with 25 minutes
still on her clock.

40:25.958 --> 40:26.791
Excellent.

40:26.875 --> 40:28.708
What a brilliant recovery.

40:31.416 --> 40:34.041
I resign with relief.

40:35.125 --> 40:37.541
I've played your games
since I was a small girl.

40:38.125 --> 40:39.833
I've always really admired you.

40:39.916 --> 40:41.625
You are how old again?

40:42.416 --> 40:44.291
-I'm twenty--
-Oh, no. Don't tell me.

40:45.125 --> 40:47.416
It will only drive a stake
through my heart.

40:47.500 --> 40:48.708
[laughs]

40:48.791 --> 40:52.000
I went over your games
at this tournament.

40:53.041 --> 40:55.666
You are a marvel, my dear.

40:57.833 --> 41:01.875
I may have just played
the best chess player of my life.

41:05.416 --> 41:06.958
You will get used to it.

41:07.041 --> 41:08.041
[chuckles]

41:11.833 --> 41:12.666
Thank you.

41:13.625 --> 41:15.625
[crowd clamoring in Russian]

41:22.500 --> 41:25.166
[commentator 1] So far, Harmon
is proving to be the biggest attraction

41:25.250 --> 41:27.500
since the Youth Festival in 1957.

41:27.583 --> 41:30.875
Some in Moscow are even calling her
an ambassador of sorts.

41:30.958 --> 41:33.666
This evening she played
the English opening against Flento,

41:33.750 --> 41:37.208
a sequence I've always found
to be like the Sicilian in reverse.

41:37.291 --> 41:38.458
He's nowhere near her level,

41:38.541 --> 41:41.375
and I don't think she expected
the game to go on for nearly four hours.

41:42.250 --> 41:45.541
But Flento put up quite a fight
along the two main diagonals,

41:45.625 --> 41:48.625
and played the Four Knights Variation
with a sophistication that looked,

41:48.708 --> 41:51.375
for a while at least,
like it was far beyond Harmon's.

41:52.708 --> 41:55.916
But by the middlegame,
she'd traded herself out of that position,

41:56.000 --> 41:57.958
and ultimately forced Flento to resign.

42:00.291 --> 42:01.125
The result being

42:01.208 --> 42:04.250
she could come to her match
with Borgov tomorrow, exhausted.

42:04.333 --> 42:05.250

[Paul and Alice arguing indistinctly]

42:24.250 --> 42:27.041
[Paul] You shouldn't have brought her.
Why did you bring her here?

42:27.125 --> 42:29.000
-Because I need your help!
-It's too late!

42:34.750 --> 42:37.291
-[young Beth] Who was that?
-[Alice] A mistake.

42:38.416 --> 42:40.083
A-A rounding error.

42:41.500 --> 42:43.833
It's just a problem I gotta solve.

42:46.083 --> 42:47.416
[young Beth] What problem?

42:48.458 --> 42:49.291
[sighs]

42:50.541 --> 42:51.625
What I do with you.

43:01.500 --> 43:02.375

Elizabeth Harmon plays pawn to Queen four.

44:19.833 --> 44:22.958
Borgov plays pawn to Queen four.

44:23.875 --> 44:27.958
Harmon plays pawn to Queen Bishop four.

Borgov declines,

44:31.916 --> 44:35.375
moves pawn to King four.

44:35.458 --> 44:39.750
[commentator 1, in English] Borgov's
second move is a bit of a surprise.

44:39.833 --> 44:41.833
Normally, Borgov would do
something more solid,

44:41.916 --> 44:45.833
but here, he's going against his own style
and playing a rare line to win.

44:46.500 --> 44:47.708
He must win.

44:47.791 --> 44:50.250
Harmon's response
was a complete deviation from the Albin,

44:50.333 --> 44:51.916
which must've surprised him right back,

44:52.000 --> 44:54.125
whilst allowing her
to get out into the open.

44:54.625 --> 44:58.416
Now, the two of them can fight it out
from here with their own wits.

[reporters yelling] Ms. Harmon!
One question!

48:08.041 --> 48:10.166
Hi, Dick Evans from Time.
Do you have a minute?

48:10.250 --> 48:12.666
That depends.
Will you put me on the cover?

48:12.750 --> 48:15.708
-Hmm. Are you going to beat him?
-I haven't made any mistakes so far.

48:15.791 --> 48:16.666
Hm. Neither has he.

48:16.750 --> 48:19.791
Is it true you learned how to play
at an orphanage when you were two?

48:19.875 --> 48:22.125
-I was nine.
-Such a young age. Who taught you?

48:24.791 --> 48:26.000
His name was Shaibel.

48:26.083 --> 48:27.541
William Shaibel.

48:27.625 --> 48:30.000
He was a janitor.
We played in the basement.

48:30.083 --> 48:32.625
-The janitor taught you to play chess?
-[Beth] That's right.

48:32.708 --> 48:34.833
William Shaibel was a fine player.

48:34.916 --> 48:37.375
He spent a lot of time at it,
and he was quite good.

48:37.916 --> 48:40.458
Now, will you please
promise to print that?

48:40.541 --> 48:42.125
Absolutely. Thank you.

48:42.208 --> 48:43.208
Yes, yes. Sure.

48:43.291 --> 48:45.291
Thank you.
If you'll excuse me, I'm very tired.

48:45.375 --> 48:49.208
[man, over clamor] Excuse me, Miss Harmon,
I'm with the Lexington Herald-Leader.

48:51.666 --> 48:53.166
[warm music playing]

48:54.500 --> 48:57.500
Our readers back home in Kentucky
would like to know if it's true.

48:58.166 --> 48:59.708
That you're here all by yourself?

49:02.416 --> 49:04.208
-[both laugh]
-[camera clicking]

49:06.291 --> 49:08.333
How did you even get a visa so fast?

49:08.416 --> 49:09.625
The newspaper helped me.

49:10.291 --> 49:11.875
I'm an associate editor now.

49:12.875 --> 49:14.541
And the Moscow Embassy.

49:15.083 --> 49:16.500
-Really?
-Yeah.

49:16.583 --> 49:18.666
I'm guessing
they thought I'd distract you.

49:18.750 --> 49:19.583
[Beth chuckles]

49:20.083 --> 49:21.250
If they only knew.

49:24.958 --> 49:26.708
I know you were angry with me.

49:28.833 --> 49:29.666
And I'm sorry.

49:31.208 --> 49:32.666
I should've told you the whole story.

49:33.416 --> 49:34.250
No.

49:35.125 --> 49:35.958
I'm sorry.

49:37.958 --> 49:39.083
I should have let you.

49:41.875 --> 49:42.708
I will admit…

49:43.583 --> 49:44.416
I was a little…

49:46.125 --> 49:47.000
confused.

49:49.333 --> 49:50.875
You really are something.

49:52.791 --> 49:55.916
But, um, what I really wanted
was for us to be friends.

49:58.458 --> 50:00.541
And you kind of broke my heart.

50:02.791 --> 50:04.250
I have a way of doing that.

50:07.750 --> 50:08.666
Do you forgive me?

50:11.875 --> 50:12.708
Clearly.

50:13.750 --> 50:15.541
[laughs]

50:15.625 --> 50:16.458

50:18.000 --> 50:21.708
Consider me your second. What do we need
to do to help you beat Borgov?

50:23.833 --> 50:26.291
Well, what I need are…

50:28.833 --> 50:29.708
the pills.

50:31.041 --> 50:34.000
The booze. I need my mind cloudy to win.

50:34.583 --> 50:37.208
-I can't visualize the games without them.
-Really?

50:37.291 --> 50:40.833
-You think that's what brought you here?
-I think that's what I'm used to.

50:40.916 --> 50:43.250
Yeah, but you've been doing fine
without all that.

50:44.333 --> 50:47.291
-Haven't you?
-Yes, I…

50:48.041 --> 50:49.333
threw away the pills.

50:50.291 --> 50:53.125
And then I asked the front desk
where I could get more. [chuckles]

50:54.291 --> 50:55.875
I just really need them right now.

50:56.625 --> 50:57.625

-Hello?
-If he goes for the knight,

52:24.958 --> 52:26.333
hit him with a king rook pawn.

52:27.250 --> 52:28.083
Benny?

52:28.166 --> 52:30.083
If he goes for the bishop,
do the same thing,

52:30.166 --> 52:31.583
but open up your queen file.

52:31.666 --> 52:32.791

It's in the Times.

It's 7 a.m. here,

for three hours.

52:38.208 --> 52:39.208
We?

Hi, Beth.

52:46.208 --> 52:47.625
Hi, Harry. [chuckles softly]

52:57.416 --> 53:00.541
All right. Hey, assholes,
this is costing me a bundle.

53:00.625 --> 53:03.333
Beth, listen to me,
you gotta open up that file, okay?

53:03.958 --> 53:06.125
[sighs] How do I do that?

53:06.208 --> 53:08.583
There are four ways,
depending on what he does,

53:08.666 --> 53:10.500
and we've each been working a way through.

53:11.208 --> 53:12.125
You have it handy?

53:13.208 --> 53:14.375
[chuckles]

53:14.458 --> 53:15.833
Yes, I do. Yes.

53:15.916 --> 53:19.000
Great, okay. Well, let's start
with his knight to rook four.

53:19.083 --> 53:21.750
We push that king knight pawn.
You got that?

53:21.833 --> 53:23.916
-Yes.
-Great. I'll pass you back to Harry.

53:24.458 --> 53:26.583
[Harry] There are three things
you might do now.

53:26.666 --> 53:28.583
So, after the queen to knight three,

53:28.666 --> 53:30.666
you play knight to king six,

53:30.750 --> 53:35.125
then if he plays rook to rook five,
then you play pawn to king three.

53:36.666 --> 53:40.416
Another variation: If he plays
knight takes pawn on king five,

53:40.500 --> 53:41.833
then you take the rook.

53:41.916 --> 53:44.333
But if he plays rook to rook seven,

53:44.416 --> 53:46.833
check, then play rook to bishop two.

53:47.958 --> 53:51.500
[crowd chanting] Harmon! Harmon!
Harmon! Harmon!

53:51.583 --> 53:54.250
Harmon! Harmon! Harmon!

53:54.333 --> 53:55.291
[Beth] Benny?

53:56.000 --> 53:57.125
It's almost five here.

53:59.833 --> 54:00.666
Okay.

54:04.250 --> 54:05.250
Go beat him.

54:07.875 --> 54:09.875
[suspenseful music playing]

54:14.625 --> 54:17.708
[commentator 2, in Russian]
Borgov withdraws his queen to G6.

54:22.958 --> 54:24.500
-[piece clatters]
-[button clicks]

54:24.583 --> 54:27.625
Harmon’s knight boldly invades E6.

54:38.000 --> 54:38.833
[button clicks]

54:38.916 --> 54:41.791
Borgov attacks Harmon’s king-pawn.

54:45.250 --> 54:46.083
[button clicks]

54:51.583 --> 54:52.416
[button clicks]

54:57.333 --> 54:58.166

55:04.916 --> 55:05.750

55:17.083 --> 55:18.083
[button clicks]

55:21.916 --> 55:22.958
[whispering] Shit.

55:26.458 --> 55:28.625
-He's not doing what he's supposed to do.
-Shh!

55:31.333 --> 55:32.291
[inhales deeply]

55:34.500 --> 55:36.500
[exhales slowly]

55:38.333 --> 55:40.333
[pensive music playing]

55:57.791 --> 55:59.791
[music transitions to exciting]

56:38.208 --> 56:39.500
[music intensifies]

56:50.416 --> 56:51.291
[button clicks]

57:30.250 --> 57:31.125
Draw?

57:31.208 --> 57:34.916
Borgov never offers draws,
but he's offering Elizabeth Harmon one.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.333
If she accepts,

57:36.416 --> 57:39.458
she leaves the stage in a tie
with the world champion.

57:39.541 --> 57:40.791
If they play on,

57:40.875 --> 57:42.875
once the dust settles
and the endgame emerges,

57:42.958 --> 57:45.083
she could find herself
in a very different position.

57:45.583 --> 57:47.333
Borgov is death on endgames.

57:47.416 --> 57:48.625
He's famous for it.

57:48.708 --> 57:50.583
Harmon, on the other hand, is not.

57:50.666 --> 57:52.916
She's more known
for coming up early and strong,

57:53.000 --> 57:55.083
demoralizing her opponents from the start.

57:55.166 --> 57:57.416
So, I think she should accept the draw.

57:57.500 --> 58:00.291
The world will see it
as a solid achievement.

58:01.041 --> 58:02.541
A draw, however, is not a win.

58:03.416 --> 58:06.125
The one thing
we know about Elizabeth Harmon

58:06.208 --> 58:07.500
is that she loves to win.

58:14.333 --> 58:16.333
[suspenseful music building]

58:25.250 --> 58:27.708
-[button clicking]
-[pieces clatter softly]

58:44.708 --> 58:46.791
[commentator 1] That was
the point of the sequence,

58:46.875 --> 58:49.250
beginning with the bishop,
cutting down the scope of the rook

58:49.333 --> 58:51.166
by forcing it to a less threatening rank.

58:51.250 --> 58:53.333
-[overlapping Russian commentary]
-The question is…

58:53.958 --> 58:55.041
what will she do now?

It's your game.

Take it.

[man speaking indistinctly on phone]

1:00:40.250 --> 1:00:41.416
She won!

1:00:41.500 --> 1:00:43.500
[all yelling and laughing joyously]

1:00:48.500 --> 1:00:49.583
Thank you.

1:00:54.375 --> 1:00:55.666
[phone receiver clatters]

1:01:00.750 --> 1:01:01.583
[sighs]

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:09.416
Good for you, cracker.

1:01:12.541 --> 1:01:13.375
Good for you.

1:01:15.708 --> 1:01:16.541
Mm.

1:01:17.208 --> 1:01:19.208
[crowd applauding and cheering]

1:01:36.041 --> 1:01:37.291
[emotional music playing]

1:01:51.541 --> 1:01:53.958
[bodyguard] The president has invited you
to the White House.

1:01:54.041 --> 1:01:56.166
There'll be a chess board
set up in the Oval Office,

1:01:56.250 --> 1:01:58.708
and, of course,
a photo-op of you kicking his ass.

1:01:59.583 --> 1:02:01.625
Texas being more of a checkers state.

1:02:05.541 --> 1:02:09.250
And there's a dinner tonight
at the Russian Chess Club in Georgetown.

1:02:09.875 --> 1:02:12.291
A lot of prominent dissidents belong, so…

1:02:12.958 --> 1:02:14.958
we've prepared a list of talking points.

1:02:19.416 --> 1:02:20.250
It's a big deal.

1:02:21.666 --> 1:02:23.666
Beating the Soviets at their own game.

1:02:26.208 --> 1:02:27.791
Could you stop the car, please?

1:02:30.083 --> 1:02:31.041
I'd like to walk.

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:32.875
To the airport?

1:02:34.791 --> 1:02:36.500
-You're gonna miss the fli--

1:03:40.250 --> 1:03:41.250
[man 1] Harmon?

1:03:43.208 --> 1:03:44.333
Liza Harmon?

1:03:44.916 --> 1:03:45.750
Da.

1:03:48.541 --> 1:03:49.375
Harmon!

1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:54.750

1:04:04.291 --> 1:04:05.208
[man 2] Liza!

1:04:05.291 --> 1:04:07.291
[chatter continues indistinctly]

1:04:23.750 --> 1:04:26.750
[warm music playing]

1:04:38.875 --> 1:04:40.000
[sighs]

1:04:42.041 --> 1:04:44.125
[in Russian] Let's play.

1:04:44.208 --> 1:04:46.208
[thrilling orchestral music playing]
