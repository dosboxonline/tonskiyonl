In most ways, they're not,
but it makes them feel bigger.

00:16.916 --> 00:19.250
They can show you how things are done.

00:19.791 --> 00:21.291
You just let them blow by,

00:21.375 --> 00:24.625
and you go on ahead,
and do just what the hell you feel like.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.666
It takes a strong woman

You replay the game

07:27.166 --> 07:29.166
You read game books like Reinfeld

07:29.250 --> 07:32.250
that are full of queen sacrifices
and melodrama.

07:32.916 --> 07:34.791
You know from your tournament experience

07:34.875 --> 07:39.041
you can't rely on your opponent
setting himself up for a queen sacrifice,

07:39.125 --> 07:41.625
or a surprise mate
with a knight and a rook.

You're bored in the way you probably were

08:00.541 --> 08:03.083
when you read
Reuben Fine's endgame analysis.

08:03.166 --> 08:05.291
And then the counter analysis
in Chess Review

08:05.375 --> 08:07.208
that pointed out the errors
in Reuben Fine.

-It's good, it's good! [laughs]

08:28.125 --> 08:29.875
Yeah. Yeah.

08:30.833 --> 08:31.666
Huh.

08:36.666 --> 08:40.125
[Benny] And you haven't done anything
like what I'm making you do now.

We're playing serious chess.

The kind of chess played
by the best players in the world,

08:49.916 --> 08:50.833
the Soviets.

08:53.375 --> 08:56.083
And you know why
they're the best players in the world?

08:56.166 --> 08:58.000
They have the best suits?

08:58.083 --> 09:00.375
It's because they play together as a team,

09:01.041 --> 09:02.708
especially during adjournments.

09:04.416 --> 09:05.541
They help each other out.

09:05.625 --> 09:10.208
Us Americans, we work alone
because we're all such individualists.

09:10.708 --> 09:12.708
We don't like to let anyone help us.

like I'm putting you to sleep.

09:28.166 --> 09:29.791
Mm. I'll survive.

Beth Harmon, this is Hilton Wexler
and Grandmaster Arthur Levertov.

09:57.583 --> 09:58.708
Hi.

09:58.791 --> 10:01.166
Congratulations.
Benny needed a lesson in humility.

10:01.250 --> 10:03.791
-[Beth laughs]
-[Benny] I'm already tops in humility.

10:03.875 --> 10:04.875

I'm Cleo.

10:08.250 --> 10:09.083
Hi.

10:10.291 --> 10:11.375
[Hilton] Do you do problems?

10:12.291 --> 10:13.958
-No.
-Never?

10:14.041 --> 10:15.708
I always found them irrelevant.

10:15.791 --> 10:18.541
Positions that never come up
in actual games.

10:18.625 --> 10:19.458
[laughs]

10:20.250 --> 10:21.708
Let me show you one you might like.

10:22.541 --> 10:23.375
Okay.

10:23.875 --> 10:26.125
-Can I mess this up?
-Go ahead.

10:26.208 --> 10:28.458
Hilton, she is not
one of your problem freaks.

10:28.541 --> 10:31.041
-She's the US Champion, for Christ's sake.
-It's okay.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.750
-This one is…

do you hide your drinking glasses?

10:45.500 --> 10:47.000

10:47.583 --> 10:48.500
She's not.

10:57.000 --> 10:57.958
Drink?

11:01.416 --> 11:02.916
No, thank you.

11:04.500 --> 11:06.166
I should fix the food.

11:09.416 --> 11:11.083
Come on, that's enough of that.

11:11.166 --> 11:14.500
-Come on.
-[Arthur] Do you ever clean? [laughs]

11:14.583 --> 11:16.750
Are you here with Arthur or Hilton?

11:17.375 --> 11:18.333
Both of them.

11:19.083 --> 11:20.125
Neither of them.

11:20.958 --> 11:23.458
Two of them are better than one,
if you know what I mean.

11:24.375 --> 11:27.125
-[men chatting indistinctly]
-How do you all know each other?

11:27.833 --> 11:29.166
A sad story,

11:29.750 --> 11:32.208
involving me, a bad breakup,

11:32.291 --> 11:34.458
and a walk through
le Jardin du Luxembourg,

11:34.541 --> 11:37.375
where those two stopped me
from killing myself.

11:39.041 --> 11:40.791
Like I say, a sad story.

11:42.625 --> 11:44.458
But as I walked past,

11:44.541 --> 11:47.958
Arthur and Hilton were having
a violent argument over a chessboard,

11:48.041 --> 11:51.166
and I became mesmerized by their passion.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.166
Well, that's how they tell it, anyway.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.166
[both laugh]

11:54.250 --> 11:56.291
No, the truth is, um…

11:56.375 --> 11:59.291
Benny was there,
and I became mesmerized by Benny.

12:01.750 --> 12:02.958
Over and done.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.166
What do you do?

12:05.708 --> 12:06.541
Guess.

12:07.875 --> 12:09.458
Something in fashion?

12:09.541 --> 12:12.291
[chuckles] That's a nice way to put it.

12:13.458 --> 12:14.416
I'm a model.

12:15.250 --> 12:17.125
-[lighter clicks]
-Wow. [sighs]

12:17.750 --> 12:19.166
That must be exciting.

12:19.250 --> 12:23.291
Fashion is exciting.
Modeling and models are insipid.

12:24.375 --> 12:26.375
But it pays for my studio in the Marais.

12:27.625 --> 12:29.208
Oh, you have not been to Paris?

12:29.750 --> 12:30.583
Not yet.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.416
-Do you live there?
-Sometimes.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.750
Sometimes Berlin, sometimes here.

12:35.833 --> 12:37.125
I'm a, uh…

12:37.958 --> 12:41.125
-how do you say? A vagabond?
-[laughs] I don't know.

12:41.791 --> 12:44.000
Modeling sounds pretty exciting to me.

12:45.708 --> 12:48.416
Plus, I imagine
they give you a lot of free clothes.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.333
Ah, you like nice clothes, huh?

12:50.833 --> 12:52.083
-I do.
-[chuckles]

12:52.583 --> 12:54.208
You could never be a model.

12:55.750 --> 12:58.208
You are pretty enough,
but you are much too smart.

12:58.291 --> 12:59.875
Models are empty creatures.

12:59.958 --> 13:03.291
The camera lens fills them
with color and texture,

13:03.375 --> 13:05.333
and, once in a while, even mystery.

13:05.958 --> 13:08.416
But just like there is no mystery
to a vacant lot,

13:08.500 --> 13:11.708
it's just there until you put
something interesting on top of it…

13:12.666 --> 13:13.875
Models are the same.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.750
They are just what you put on them.

13:18.500 --> 13:20.250
You know, most are terrible in bed.

13:21.708 --> 13:25.125
But then, anyone who doesn't eat
is terrible in bed, don't you think?

13:26.208 --> 13:27.083
[laughs]

13:29.541 --> 13:30.458
[Beth] Here we go.

13:30.541 --> 13:32.041
[upbeat music playing softly]

I don't even know the rules.

13:52.166 --> 13:53.500
I'll spectate.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.500
-Do we have enough boards, enough pieces?
-Yeah, in the closet.

Mr. Chennault?

Uh, it's, uh, it's Wheatley.
He doesn't wanna sign.

Can you get over here
so we can work it out?

I don't see why you would need me.
You're the lawyer.

35:39.458 --> 35:41.958
And he said he would sign
whatever was necessary, so…

35:42.041 --> 35:44.791

Mr. Wheatley has a proposal.

36:10.083 --> 36:13.041
You can live here while you're looking
for something permanent.

36:13.958 --> 36:16.458
I thought I could keep the house
if I made the payments.

36:16.541 --> 36:17.583
Uh, Mr. Wheatley…

36:18.416 --> 36:20.208
says you misconstrued him.

36:21.041 --> 36:24.541
He, uh, claims he was just permitting you
to stay in the house, uh…

36:25.125 --> 36:26.250
until you got settled.

36:27.000 --> 36:27.916
That's not true.

36:29.541 --> 36:30.666
He said I could have it.

36:32.416 --> 36:33.250
Remember?

36:37.416 --> 36:38.875
Can't you even look at me?

36:41.125 --> 36:43.500
-You adopted me. Can't you talk to me?
-Alma.

36:44.666 --> 36:46.666
-Alma wanted a child.
-[Beth] You signed the papers.

36:46.750 --> 36:50.250
-You took on a responsibility.
-Alma wanted to adopt you, not me.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.875
You're not entitled to everything I own,

36:51.958 --> 36:54.041
just 'cause I signed
some papers to shut her up.

36:55.333 --> 36:56.291
Not that it worked.

36:57.666 --> 36:59.458
You adopted me.

37:01.083 --> 37:02.083

is gonna take it away from me.

Oh, I'm not an orphan.
I'm your daughter.

37:11.791 --> 37:13.166
Not in my book, you aren't.

37:14.166 --> 37:16.500
I don't give a shit
what your goddamn lawyer says.

37:16.583 --> 37:20.000
Or what Alma said, either.
That woman could not keep her mouth shut.

37:20.083 --> 37:22.375
I thought the piano would help, it didn't.

37:22.458 --> 37:23.875
So, here you are.

37:23.958 --> 37:26.000
It's all so pathetic.

37:29.458 --> 37:30.916
Did you ever hear her play?

37:32.333 --> 37:33.333
Of course.

37:33.416 --> 37:35.250
Yes, but did you ever really listen?

37:36.666 --> 37:39.125
Alma was not pathetic,
she was stuck. There's a difference.

37:39.250 --> 37:41.125
She didn't know how to get out of it.

-Sell it to me.

37:55.916 --> 37:56.958
What are you talking about?

37:57.958 --> 37:58.791
I'll buy it.

37:59.833 --> 38:01.166
I'll pay whatever your equity is.

38:01.250 --> 38:03.583
-No, it's worth more than that now.
-How much more?

38:05.583 --> 38:06.791
I'd need 7,000.

38:06.875 --> 38:08.416
Your equity is less than five.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.750
It's seven. I'll show you the receipts.

38:14.166 --> 38:15.000
Fine.

38:16.458 --> 38:17.291

38:20.125 --> 38:21.750
-You have that much?
-[Beth] Yes.
