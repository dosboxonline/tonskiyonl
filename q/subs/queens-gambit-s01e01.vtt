Doesn't say.

04:36.416 --> 04:40.250
I would guess that,
like most men who live around there,

04:40.333 --> 04:44.041
he was yet another victim

05:40.583 --> 05:42.916
I also teach etiquette
to the young ladies.

will be the death of you!

-[Jolene] Oh, fuck you, you cocksucker.
-[Fergussen] You can't yell like that.

06:00.625 --> 06:04.041
In there is our classroom.
You'll meet your teachers on Monday.

[both, in unison]
Good morning, Mrs. Deardorff.

Good morning, girls.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.458
Home sweet home.

06:18.166 --> 06:19.791
Come on, let's get you settled.

06:21.208 --> 06:25.208
We have 21 girls here,
and they are all just as sweet as you.

06:28.666 --> 06:31.541
And here is your special place.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.666
-Shoo! Go, go, go.
-[girl] Okay.

06:38.791 --> 06:40.833
You can put your clothes down here.

06:40.916 --> 06:45.208
And your toothbrush can go right here.

06:45.750 --> 06:48.375
And any other personal items, there.

Show her to me.

Come on, sit.

07:05.333 --> 07:08.500
I know that, at this moment,
all you're feeling is loss.

07:10.416 --> 07:14.458
But after grief brings you low,
prayer and faith will lift you high.

07:15.541 --> 07:18.208
High enough for you
to see a new path for yourself.

07:20.083 --> 07:21.500
I think, Elizabeth,

07:21.583 --> 07:23.958
you're going to find
a much different life here.

07:25.583 --> 07:27.458
A better one than you might have had.

07:28.208 --> 07:31.541
And I'm sure that you and I
are going to be good friends.

We have one more stop.

08:26.333 --> 08:29.708
Mr. Fergussen will take good care of you.
I'll see you at dinner.

08:36.833 --> 08:38.583
The green ones are the best.

08:39.750 --> 08:40.583
What are they?

08:40.666 --> 08:41.666
Vitamins.

08:42.333 --> 08:44.625
-Magic vitamins.
-[laughs]

08:45.208 --> 08:48.416
I were you, I'd save
the green ones up for the night time.

08:48.500 --> 08:50.916
Otherwise, they turn off
right when you need them to turn on.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.958

-Beth.
-Jolene.

09:03.208 --> 09:05.833
What's the last thing
they said to you before they died?

09:06.958 --> 09:09.375
I ask everybody that.
We get some really fun answers.

09:11.250 --> 09:12.416
Close your eyes.

09:13.875 --> 09:15.041

We eat it every Friday.

11:00.125 --> 11:01.541
You gotta eat every bite,

-What I understand

12:08.416 --> 12:10.875
is you're not taking care of yourself.

She's happy here.
This is where she belongs.

[Mr. Ganz]
Well, what if Shirley Munson,

42:17.041 --> 42:19.416
club treasurer
and one of my best students,

42:19.500 --> 42:20.583
she comes along?

42:22.791 --> 42:24.208
What do you say, Elizabeth?

42:24.875 --> 42:27.083
Do you want to play chess
at the high school?

42:28.250 --> 42:30.416
Yes, I'd like to.

42:32.250 --> 42:33.083
Okay.

42:34.000 --> 42:34.958
It's settled, then.

42:36.291 --> 42:37.750
Mr. Ganz and, uh…

42:38.583 --> 42:39.708
-Charlotte?
-Shirley.

42:39.791 --> 42:40.666
Shirley, yes.

42:41.666 --> 42:44.916
They will pick you up,
let's say after lunch on Thursday?

42:45.000 --> 42:45.833
Perfect.

42:55.250 --> 42:56.166
I'll see you then.

42:59.708 --> 43:00.833
[Deardorff] Elizabeth.

43:01.875 --> 43:05.541
I'm told that you've been playing chess
with our custodian.

43:06.625 --> 43:07.625
With Mr. Shaibel.

43:09.083 --> 43:09.916
Yes, ma'am.

43:11.166 --> 43:13.625
This is very irregular, Elizabeth.

43:14.708 --> 43:16.041
Have you gone to the basement?

43:17.250 --> 43:18.125
Yes, ma'am.

43:19.208 --> 43:20.458
Well, we can't have that.

43:21.166 --> 43:23.750
As much as Methuen believes in excellence,

43:23.833 --> 43:26.208
we can't have you
playing chess in the basement.

[phone ringing]

43:29.000 --> 43:30.166
[sighs]

43:30.250 --> 43:33.125
I believe that we have chess sets
in the game closet.

43:34.083 --> 43:36.041
I'll have Fergussen look into that.

43:36.125 --> 43:38.708
-[phone continues ringing]
-That'll be all, Elizabeth.

43:39.208 --> 43:41.083
Mind your manners at the high school.

-[receiver picks up]
-Helen Deardorff.

43:46.375 --> 43:48.500
-There's one missing.
-[Fergussen] That's it.

43:50.000 --> 43:50.833
Next.

43:50.916 --> 43:52.125
It's my turn, Harmon.

43:53.000 --> 43:54.000
Where are the green ones?

43:54.083 --> 43:55.541
You don't get them anymore.

43:56.875 --> 43:58.416
There they are, right behind you.

43:58.500 --> 44:01.791
I know where they are, Harmon,
but I'm not gonna give you any.

44:01.875 --> 44:04.541
New state law.
No more tranquilizers for kids.

44:05.250 --> 44:07.375
-Go figure.
-Harmon.

44:07.458 --> 44:08.666
"Go thou further off."

44:08.750 --> 44:11.416
"Bid me farewell,
and let me hear thee going."

44:12.791 --> 44:14.250
-What?
-Beat it.

[uneasy music playing]

45:05.500 --> 45:07.958
[Beth]
Did Fergussen give you any green pills?

45:08.041 --> 45:09.875
Extra ones?

45:09.958 --> 45:11.791
No, honey, I wish he would.

45:11.875 --> 45:13.416
But they got the state after them

45:13.500 --> 45:15.583
for what they've been doing
with those pills.

45:17.333 --> 45:18.333
They're still there.

45:19.375 --> 45:20.541
In the big jar.

45:20.625 --> 45:21.458
That a fact?

45:23.375 --> 45:24.375
I ain't noticed.

45:28.791 --> 45:30.583
You're having withdrawal symptoms?

45:31.541 --> 45:32.375
I don't know.

45:33.500 --> 45:34.416
What are those?

45:35.083 --> 45:36.416
Withdrawal, like…

45:37.666 --> 45:39.500
I don't know, you getting edgy?

45:42.625 --> 45:43.708
Yeah, you are.

45:45.625 --> 45:46.541
You look around,

45:47.708 --> 45:50.875
there's gonna be some jumpy orphans
around here the next few days.

45:55.250 --> 45:57.250
[uneasy music continues]

46:19.208 --> 46:20.166
[Fergussen] Harmon.

46:21.708 --> 46:22.541
You all right?

46:25.208 --> 46:27.583
-Do you play the King's Gambit?
-No.

46:27.666 --> 46:28.958
It's my favorite.

46:29.041 --> 46:31.125
Did you know chess is older than checkers?

46:31.208 --> 46:33.541
-No.
-By, like, 400 years.

46:33.625 --> 46:34.458
Wait!

46:35.833 --> 46:36.958
Can I talk to Beth?

46:37.625 --> 46:40.416
-Just for a second, wish her luck.
-Sure, go ahead.

46:46.791 --> 46:48.541
[kisses] Good luck.

48:03.500 --> 48:06.333
Take your seats and be quiet, please.

48:06.416 --> 48:11.500
Charles Levy will take board number one
since he's our top player.

48:12.041 --> 48:16.041
The rest of you can sit where you want to.
There will be no talking during play.

48:31.375 --> 48:32.375
Do I start now?

48:32.458 --> 48:34.041
With board number one.

48:34.833 --> 48:36.500
And then I go on to the next one?

48:36.583 --> 48:37.541
That's right.

49:04.333 --> 49:07.541
They can't respond
until you've opened at every board.

49:09.083 --> 49:11.083
[thrilling music playing]

49:19.958 --> 49:22.541
[Beth]
What surprised me was how bad they played.

49:23.208 --> 49:25.500
They left backward pawns
all over the place,

49:26.041 --> 49:28.291
and their pieces were wide open for forks.

49:59.875 --> 50:01.041
[indistinct whispering]

50:05.166 --> 50:07.750
[Beth]
A few of them tried stupid mating attacks.

50:10.958 --> 50:12.166
But I took care of them.

50:17.291 --> 50:19.000
This boy, Charles Levy,

50:19.708 --> 50:21.291
he was supposed to be the best.

50:22.041 --> 50:24.541
I had his pieces tied up in 15 moves.

50:25.500 --> 50:28.416
I mated him in six more,
with a knight-rook combination.

50:29.625 --> 50:30.791
[chess pieces clacking]

50:39.208 --> 50:43.041
Mr. Ganz told me I beat them all
in an hour and 20 minutes.

50:45.291 --> 50:46.166
It felt good.

50:47.708 --> 50:49.291
I've never won anything before.

50:52.500 --> 50:54.083
[Mr. Shaibel] You should get back.

51:12.125 --> 51:13.375
Don't be rude.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.541
This is Samantha. She just got here.

51:17.333 --> 51:18.875
Haven't you got even just one?
