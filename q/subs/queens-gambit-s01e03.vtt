02:27.250 --> 02:28.916
I asked for a pleasant room,

02:29.541 --> 02:31.208
and I believe they gave me one.

-Harmon. Kentucky State Champion.

03:07.583 --> 03:08.625
Nice to meet you.

03:09.708 --> 03:13.375
There are two games a day,
and the time control is 120/40.

03:14.916 --> 03:17.500
You get two hours to make 40 moves.

03:21.250 --> 03:22.541
Welcome to Cincinnati.

03:23.166 --> 03:24.000
Thank you.

03:25.708 --> 03:29.208
And the rook comes to the seventh rank.

03:29.916 --> 03:30.958
That right there…

03:32.083 --> 03:33.875
that is a bone in the throat.

03:34.625 --> 03:38.125
Guy takes one look at this,
he pays up, 20 bucks.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.458
The Caro-Kann Defense, genuine bummer.

03:41.125 --> 03:42.541
What's wrong with Caro-Kann?

03:44.291 --> 03:46.291
It's all pawns and no hope.

03:47.916 --> 03:51.250
Here, look, I'll show you, all right?
This is Caro-Kann.

03:51.333 --> 03:53.291
-[chess pieces clatter]
-I'd take the knight.

03:56.333 --> 03:57.208
You're, um…

03:59.625 --> 04:02.041
Aren't you that kid from Kentucky
who wiped out Harry Beltik?

04:02.125 --> 04:04.875
If you take his knight,
then you double his pawns.

04:05.791 --> 04:08.708
Big deal. Like I said, it's all pawns…

04:09.500 --> 04:10.666
and no hope.

04:11.291 --> 04:13.125
Let me show you how you win with Black.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.583
Watch this.

04:18.583 --> 04:19.791
What does White do here?

04:20.416 --> 04:23.291
-[Beth, man 1] Queen takes pawn.
-[man 2] Queen takes pawn.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.458
Rook to king eight. Check.

04:27.541 --> 04:28.500
Queen falls.

04:29.333 --> 04:30.916
-That’s Mieses-Reshevsky.
-[man 2] Yeah.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.583
-[man 1] From the '30s.
-Very good. Margate, 1935.

04:34.541 --> 04:37.958
-White played rook to queen one.
-What else has he got?

04:39.291 --> 04:40.416
All right, I gotta go.

04:41.500 --> 04:42.458
Hey, you know what?

04:43.833 --> 04:45.708
Reshevsky, he was playing like that…

04:46.333 --> 04:48.750
back when he was your age, little girl.

04:49.958 --> 04:50.833
Or even younger.

04:54.833 --> 04:55.666
Are you playing?

04:56.500 --> 04:57.333
Oh, what, here?

04:59.083 --> 05:00.791
Nah, nah.

05:01.833 --> 05:04.208
Just come through, see some old friends.

05:05.416 --> 05:08.333
And plus, playing too many opens…

05:08.958 --> 05:11.083
it can only hurt me, you know what I mean?

05:12.208 --> 05:13.041
Good luck.

05:21.375 --> 05:22.291
-Hello.
-Hello.

05:22.375 --> 05:24.000
Beth Harmon. Where am I playing?

05:25.250 --> 05:26.958
It's table 15, right over there.

05:28.791 --> 05:30.166
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

05:36.958 --> 05:39.250
-Beth Harmon.
-Shit.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.375
-[Beth] Hey!
-[man] Stupid…

05:46.458 --> 05:48.500
-Harmon?
-What are you two doing here?

05:49.416 --> 05:50.500
Losing mostly.

05:51.083 --> 05:54.000
We're on the university team now.
Second and third alternate.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.791
Oh, I'm sorry we won't get to play.

05:56.875 --> 05:59.833
[scoffs] We're not.
You destroy everyone you play, Harmon.

06:00.625 --> 06:03.333
-I can only lose so much.
-[chuckles] That's the truth.

-[Mrs. Wheatley laughing]
-Do you mind?

06:18.708 --> 06:21.250
-[laughing] Sorry.
-[woman 2] It works out. You see, it…

06:21.333 --> 06:25.166
It keeps the bowlers cool,
and you automatically…

06:25.250 --> 06:26.375
[TV volume lowers]

06:30.041 --> 06:31.666
What on earth for?

06:31.750 --> 06:33.708
Looking for weaknesses in my play.

06:33.791 --> 06:35.166
[TV continues softly]

06:35.250 --> 06:36.083
I see.

06:37.333 --> 06:38.166
And?

06:39.458 --> 06:40.500
[Beth] There aren't any.

06:42.416 --> 06:43.250

than I imagined.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.833
Did you watch the whole game?

07:40.416 --> 07:41.333
Of course.

07:41.416 --> 07:42.250
[man] Beth.

07:44.083 --> 07:46.833
When he brought out his rook,
then took that pawn…

07:48.000 --> 07:50.333
I thought you were done for.
I should have known better.

07:50.416 --> 07:51.500
Yes, you should have.

07:51.583 --> 07:52.500
[man chuckles]

07:52.583 --> 07:53.416
Elizabeth,

07:54.000 --> 07:56.375
aren't you going to introduce me
to your friends?

07:56.458 --> 07:57.708
[Beth] Sorry.

07:57.791 --> 07:59.583
Matt, Mike, this is my mom.

08:00.750 --> 08:02.083
Mike, nice to meet you.

08:02.166 --> 08:03.791
-Nice to meet you.
-And I'm Matt.

08:03.875 --> 08:06.041
-Mm. A pleasure.
-[Matt] Nice to meet you.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.041
Well, I don't know about you young people,
but I'm famished.

08:11.125 --> 08:14.416
-There's a restaurant in the hotel lobby.
-Mm. Show us the way?

08:14.500 --> 08:15.333
Sure.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.625
I can't make up my mind
which one is more handsome.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.000
I'd like to play in the US Open.

08:25.583 --> 08:26.458
You might win it.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.833
Would that lead to playing abroad?

08:29.500 --> 08:30.625
In Europe, I mean?

08:30.708 --> 08:33.666
No reason why not. They have to know you
before they invite you.

08:33.750 --> 08:35.750
Would winning the Open
make them know about me?

08:35.833 --> 08:36.708
[Matt] Hell yes!

08:36.791 --> 08:40.375
Benny Watts plays in Europe all the time
now that he has his international title.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.041
How's the prize money?

08:42.750 --> 08:45.625
-[Matt] Pretty good, I think.
-Hm? What's pretty good?

08:46.250 --> 08:47.250
More than in the States.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.208
What about Russia?

08:50.208 --> 08:51.458
The Soviets are murder.

08:51.541 --> 08:53.166
They eat Americans for breakfast there.

08:53.250 --> 08:57.166
I don't think there's been an American
with a prayer against them in 20 years.

08:57.791 --> 08:58.666
It's like ballet.

08:58.750 --> 09:00.666
They pay people to play chess.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.750
We should probably go.
We don't wanna be late.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.416
This one's for all the marbles.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.583
Five hundred of them to be exact.

about being crowded into an ending

09:26.416 --> 09:28.583
with a rook, a knight, and three pawns.

09:30.333 --> 09:31.416
It's so complicated.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.000
[Matt] Uh-oh.

09:35.958 --> 09:37.125
And that's check.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.000
And that's mate.

09:46.333 --> 09:47.458
[onlookers applauding]

09:49.166 --> 09:52.250
I've allowed 12 dollars
for our celebration supper tonight,

09:52.333 --> 09:55.041
and two dollars for a small breakfast
in the morning.

09:55.625 --> 09:59.625
That makes our total expenses,
so far, $172.30.

09:59.708 --> 10:02.333
Which leaves over 300 dollars.

10:03.875 --> 10:04.708
Beth…

10:08.583 --> 10:09.583
I was thinking…

10:12.333 --> 10:16.166
perhaps you could give me 10%,
as an agent's commission?

10:22.958 --> 10:24.541
Let's make it 15%.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.458
Which would be 49 dollars and 54 cents.

10:32.083 --> 10:34.583
They told me at Methuen
you were marvelous at math.

10:38.750 --> 10:41.583
[Mrs. Wheatley] "Schoolgirl beats
Grandmaster in Pittsburgh."

10:42.083 --> 10:45.833
"Onlookers were amazed
at her youthful fine points of strategy."

10:46.458 --> 10:50.250
"She shows the assurance
of a player twice her age."

10:53.041 --> 10:54.833
That's national recognition, dear.

10:55.791 --> 10:57.500
I'm afraid she's had a bit of a relapse.

10:57.583 --> 11:00.333
The doctor wants to keep her in bed
for a few more days.

11:03.541 --> 11:05.375
I'm sure she'll be better by Monday.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.208

I've ever seen in a child.

11:08.291 --> 11:09.333

11:10.458 --> 11:12.041
[whispering] We're gonna be late.

11:12.958 --> 11:13.791
Yeah.

11:14.375 --> 11:15.500
Lots of liquids.

11:17.041 --> 11:19.041
-Thank you.
-[flight attendant] You're welcome.

11:24.333 --> 11:27.916
There's a tournament in Houston
over the holidays, starting on the 26th.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.958
I understand it's very easy
to travel on Christmas Day

11:35.041 --> 11:37.958
since most people are home
eating plum pudding or whatever.

11:39.458 --> 11:40.833
[Beth] I saw that one, too.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.083
I believe we could fly to Houston,

11:46.666 --> 11:49.208
have a very pleasant
winter vacation in the sun.

11:50.708 --> 11:51.916
Do girly things.

11:53.041 --> 11:55.958
I hear they have
a very lovely beauty spa at the hotel.

11:58.875 --> 11:59.708
Yes, Mother.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.583
She has a fever of 101.

29:49.958 --> 29:51.333
[Roger] Pleasure to meet you, Beth.

29:52.250 --> 29:53.083
You too.

29:54.958 --> 29:56.125
Dinner's at nine.

29:57.833 --> 29:58.666
Don't forget.

30:04.291 --> 30:05.333

30:07.625 --> 30:10.291
[man on TV] Marge, did your aunt
leave you everything?

30:11.166 --> 30:12.500
[woman on TV] I was her only heir.

30:12.583 --> 30:13.958
Where have you been, honey?

30:14.500 --> 30:16.541
You've been gone for hours.

30:16.625 --> 30:19.458
-Playing chess.
-[woman] I don't wanna talk about it.

30:19.541 --> 30:21.166
-Practicing.
-[man] Okay.

30:21.250 --> 30:24.000
-[TV continues indistinctly]
-[Mrs. Wheatley] That's all?

30:24.791 --> 30:26.791
Yeah, that's all.

30:27.375 --> 30:30.708
[man] Well, it's the perfume I use
that makes me smell so nice.

30:31.541 --> 30:33.750
Do me a favor
and hand me a beer on the desk?

30:35.916 --> 30:36.958
[woman] What do you want?

30:37.541 --> 30:40.250
[man] I think I've got one.
I think I've got a gimmick.

30:41.666 --> 30:44.333
A gimmick is an angle that works for you.

30:44.416 --> 30:46.750
To keep you
from working too hard for yourself.

30:47.750 --> 30:50.250
-Simple.
-[woman] Specifically, what is your angle?

30:50.333 --> 30:51.500
[man] Specifically…

30:53.708 --> 30:55.416
I suppose you've never had beer.

30:57.750 --> 30:59.250
-[woman] All right, Sam.
-Here.

31:02.958 --> 31:03.875
[woman] Come here.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.291
My father used to work here
as a mill hand.

31:09.833 --> 31:14.291
-[man] So did mine. When he was sober.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast.

31:14.375 --> 31:15.416
[man] Now, you're even.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.125
[woman] Now, I'm even.

31:17.916 --> 31:21.083
I was 21 when I took it over.
It had 3,000 workers then.

31:21.166 --> 31:22.708
It's got 30,000 now.

31:23.333 --> 31:26.208
Ran as far as that gate,
now it goes down to the edge of the river.

31:27.208 --> 31:28.750
And I did it all by myself.

31:29.666 --> 31:31.916
-Without Walter, without--
-I'd like another.

31:33.208 --> 31:35.666
-[woman] All by myself.
-You really shouldn't.

31:35.750 --> 31:37.708
[man]
Half of this should make quite a score.

31:39.958 --> 31:40.791
All right.

31:41.458 --> 31:43.708
But if you're gonna have one,
get me one, too.

31:44.208 --> 31:45.833
[man] That's what I had in mind.

31:46.958 --> 31:48.958
[woman] You went out of here
a dirty kid once before,

31:49.041 --> 31:50.291
that can happen again.

31:51.083 --> 31:53.458
[man on commercial]
Escape from clothesline drudgery,

31:53.541 --> 31:55.208
but listen to Jinx first.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.041
[woman on commercial] When you buy
your dryer, be sure you get the best kind,

31:59.125 --> 32:00.583
a gas dryer.

32:00.666 --> 32:03.625
Your most delicate fabrics
are safe in a gas dryer.

32:05.583 --> 32:10.000
See? A gentle stream of warm air
sends the clothes' moisture away.

32:12.833 --> 32:14.833
[pensive music playing]

32:20.541 --> 32:23.375
[Beth] My first match
was against this guy from Oklahoma.

32:24.916 --> 32:26.666
It was all over in two dozen moves.

32:26.750 --> 32:27.583
Ouch.

32:28.125 --> 32:30.458
Then, this guy from San Francisco.

32:31.083 --> 32:32.125
I played the Marshall.

32:33.875 --> 32:37.291
Um, sacrificed my queen,
the way that Paul Morphy did one time.

32:37.375 --> 32:38.916
Mm-hm. One more.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.041
What about, um…

32:41.916 --> 32:43.791
What's his name?
The one you told me about.

32:43.875 --> 32:45.041
Bobby something?

32:45.125 --> 32:48.416
-Benny Watts.
-Yes, him.

32:48.500 --> 32:50.041
No losses, but one draw.

32:50.583 --> 32:53.541
Queens Gambit Declined
is so well respected.

32:53.625 --> 32:55.583
[Beth] I've seen him a couple of times.

32:56.458 --> 32:57.666
Always got a crowd around him.

32:57.750 --> 33:00.250
Well, of course, he's the US Champion.

33:00.333 --> 33:01.291
He's Benny Watts.

33:01.375 --> 33:02.291
[laughs]

33:03.375 --> 33:05.708
[Beth] Some people say
he's the most talented American player

33:05.791 --> 33:06.625
since Morphy.

33:07.583 --> 33:09.625
I read about a game
he played in Copenhagen,

33:09.708 --> 33:11.208
a draw against Najdorf.

33:11.875 --> 33:13.125
That was in 1948,

33:13.208 --> 33:15.333
which means that Benny
was eight years old.

33:16.583 --> 33:19.916
I've seen a picture of him at 13
in front of a whole bunch of sailors.

33:20.458 --> 33:23.416
He played against the entire team
at Annapolis without losing a game.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.333
Sounds like someone else I know.

33:26.125 --> 33:28.916
When I was nine,
I was playing Mr. Shaibel in the basement.

33:30.166 --> 33:32.708
Anyway, I'm not afraid of him.

33:32.791 --> 33:35.166
I don't suppose
there's anyone you're afraid of.

33:36.958 --> 33:38.708
There is one player that scares me.

33:40.625 --> 33:41.458
Who?

33:42.416 --> 33:43.250
The Russian.

33:45.416 --> 33:46.250
Borgov.

33:46.750 --> 33:49.916
[Benny] It's a lot more
of a dynamic game than the Caro.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.958
Which is not the case
with QGD versus Slav.

33:56.250 --> 33:57.458
[coins clanking]

34:04.541 --> 34:05.500
You're Beth Harmon.

34:07.166 --> 34:08.000
[Beth] Yes.

34:10.041 --> 34:11.250
I saw the piece in Life.

34:13.166 --> 34:16.333
Game they printed, that was a pretty one.
The one with you and Beltik.

34:16.833 --> 34:17.666
[Beth] Thank you.

34:19.208 --> 34:21.125
I'm, uh, Benny Watts.

34:21.208 --> 34:22.041
[Beth] I know.

34:22.958 --> 34:25.375
We met a couple of years ago
in Cincinnati.

34:25.458 --> 34:27.041
Didn't meet, but we spoke.

34:28.541 --> 34:30.708
-Cincinnati?
-You didn't play that year.

34:32.208 --> 34:34.583
Okay, I'll take your word for it.

34:35.916 --> 34:37.166
Guess I'll see you tomorrow.

34:38.291 --> 34:39.666
You shouldn't have castled.

34:42.125 --> 34:43.375
In your game with Beltik.

34:46.375 --> 34:47.833
I needed to get the rook out.

34:48.916 --> 34:51.041
Well, you could have lost your advantage.

34:52.625 --> 34:53.500
I don't think so.

34:56.708 --> 34:59.541
He plays pawn-takes-pawn.
You can't take back.

35:01.458 --> 35:03.000
-Wait a minute.
-I can't.

35:03.083 --> 35:05.833
I got an adjournment I gotta go play.
But set it up, think it out.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.708
Your problem is your queen knight.

35:08.791 --> 35:12.458
I don't want to set it up
and think it out.

35:19.375 --> 35:21.375
[pensive music playing]

35:40.041 --> 35:41.666
[Beth] Beltik could have beat me.

35:42.500 --> 35:43.333
But he didn't.

35:43.416 --> 35:45.333
Yes, but he could have.

35:45.416 --> 35:47.291
What's worse is I didn't even see it.

35:48.041 --> 35:51.458
Benny Watts, just by reading
about a player he knows nothing about,

35:51.541 --> 35:52.666
he picks it up.

35:54.208 --> 35:57.291
I was so proud of myself
when I found an error in a Morphy game,

35:57.375 --> 35:59.208
and now someone's done it to me.

35:59.291 --> 36:02.458
Stop thinking about
what might have happened in the past,

36:02.541 --> 36:03.791
and get some sleep.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.125
[sighs heavily]

36:09.625 --> 36:10.791

-[clock continues clicking]
-[intense music playing]

38:39.708 --> 38:41.791
[Beth] I thought he could see
what I was planning.

38:50.875 --> 38:53.958
I thought he could hear my heart beating,
and know how panicked I was.

38:59.333 --> 39:01.083
He still had time to get out of it.

39:05.000 --> 39:08.500
But he took the piece just as I planned.

39:10.666 --> 39:12.791
I went into that game
with a perfect score.

39:14.083 --> 39:17.666
Benny had two draws,
so a draw would give me the title.

39:19.875 --> 39:20.791
I wanted to win.

39:22.041 --> 39:23.375
I wanted to hammer his weaknesses.

39:23.458 --> 39:25.416
I wanted to show that pirate
that I could beat him,

39:25.500 --> 39:27.541
even though I didn't play
the way he thought I should.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.750
Then, he captured my center pawn,
my protected pawn,

39:31.833 --> 39:35.208
the pawn that had held his queen
to her corner for most of the game.

39:36.583 --> 39:37.541
I don't understand.

39:38.791 --> 39:40.916
He forced an exchange of queens.

39:42.166 --> 39:43.000
Oh.

39:43.083 --> 39:44.083
Couldn't believe it.

39:45.791 --> 39:47.625
And then I saw what it meant.

39:48.625 --> 39:51.291
With the pawn gone,
I was open to a rook-bishop mate,

39:51.375 --> 39:53.500
because of the bishop
on the open diagonal.

39:54.000 --> 39:57.333
I could protect my retreating knight
by moving one of the rooks over,

39:57.416 --> 39:59.208
but the protection wouldn't last,

39:59.291 --> 40:01.375
because his fucking,
innocent-looking knight

40:01.458 --> 40:02.791
would block my king's escape.

40:03.875 --> 40:05.916
The more I looked,
the worse it all became.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.000
Caught me completely off guard.

40:08.541 --> 40:10.375
It was brutal.

40:11.916 --> 40:13.916
It's the kind of thing
I did to other people.

40:14.625 --> 40:17.041
Kind of thing that Morphy did,
and I missed it.

40:17.125 --> 40:18.708
I'd been thinking about doubled pawns.

40:19.625 --> 40:21.250
You were thinking about winning.

40:25.333 --> 40:26.333
What did you do?

40:28.416 --> 40:30.000
I needed a counterthreat.

40:30.625 --> 40:33.750
A move that would stop him in his tracks,
but there wasn't any.

40:34.375 --> 40:36.250
I spent half an hour studying the board,

40:36.333 --> 40:39.416
and decided that Benny's move
was even sounder than I thought.

40:40.583 --> 40:42.375
I thought maybe
I could trade my way out of it

40:42.458 --> 40:43.916
if he attacked too fast, but…

40:44.875 --> 40:45.833
he was careful.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.958
I had to retreat, but he kept coming.

40:56.541 --> 40:57.750
I wanted to scream.

40:59.666 --> 41:01.041
You resign, now.

41:02.000 --> 41:03.083

41:41.291 --> 41:42.666
You'll be co-champions.

You will still get a trophy,
albeit a smaller one.

41:47.250 --> 41:48.458
It happens all the time.

41:49.208 --> 41:50.208
I made some inquiries.

-The Open Championship is often shared.
-I didn't see what he was doing.

41:55.833 --> 41:57.958
You can't finesse everything all the time.

41:59.291 --> 42:00.291
Nobody can.

42:00.916 --> 42:02.416
You don't know anything about chess.

42:04.750 --> 42:07.500
-I know what it feels like to lose.
-Yeah, I bet you do.

You'll get another shot.
