15:49.083 --> 15:51.083
And there's a certain look on your face.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.375
Intuition can't be found in books.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.791
I think you just don't like Manuel.

16:03.291 --> 16:04.666
Manuel is all right.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.458
But he doesn't come by to see me.

16:10.208 --> 16:12.041
That's irrelevant. [chuckles softly]

16:13.083 --> 16:14.250
You need to relax.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.208
There's no player in the world
as gifted as you are.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.666
I haven't the remotest idea
what faculties a person needs

16:20.750 --> 16:22.250
in order to play chess well,

16:22.333 --> 16:26.416
but I am convinced
that relaxation can only improve them.

16:27.875 --> 16:28.708
[sighs]

16:28.791 --> 16:31.375
-[thunder rumbling]
-[birds chirping, geese honking]

16:36.166 --> 16:37.291
[sighs]

16:49.291 --> 16:51.833
-[Beth] Una cerveza Corona, por favor.
-Sí.

16:53.375 --> 16:55.708
[Mr. Shaibel]
People like you have a hard time.

16:56.708 --> 16:58.041
[pensive music playing]

16:59.708 --> 17:01.291
Two sides of the same coin.

17:04.791 --> 17:05.916
You've got your gift…

17:08.875 --> 17:10.041
[coin clatters softly]

17:10.125 --> 17:11.625
…and you've got what it costs.

17:13.250 --> 17:15.166
Hard to say for you what that will be.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.000
[Beth sighs]

17:20.250 --> 17:22.791
You'll have your
time in the sun, but for how long?

17:23.583 --> 17:25.666
You've got so much anger in you.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.833
You'll have to be careful.

17:31.208 --> 17:32.208
Cerveza?

17:34.250 --> 17:35.250
Let's play.

17:37.583 --> 17:39.583
[indistinct chatter]

18:05.916 --> 18:06.958
[sighs]

18:24.916 --> 18:26.916
[speaking Russian indistinctly]

18:55.208 --> 18:57.750
-[door opens]
-[Mrs. Wheatley giggles, coughs]

18:59.625 --> 19:00.458
[door closes]

19:08.541 --> 19:10.166
-[clatter]
-[Mrs. Wheatley] Shit.

19:10.833 --> 19:13.500
[Beth]
You can turn on the light. I'm now awake.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.291
-[Beth exhales drowsily]
-[Mrs. Wheatley sniffles]

19:21.500 --> 19:22.458
I'm sorry.

19:23.000 --> 19:23.833
[coughs]

19:24.375 --> 19:26.041
I seem to have caught a virus.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.958
I don't know if I'll be able
to watch your match in the morning.

19:32.166 --> 19:33.791
-It's all right.
-[sighs heavily]

19:34.791 --> 19:36.208
You'll tell me all about it?

19:37.958 --> 19:39.291
[moans softly] Sure.

19:40.625 --> 19:42.125
-Every move?
-[chuckles]

19:44.416 --> 19:45.250
Of course.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.083
-[rain pouring]
-Hi, boys.

19:49.166 --> 19:50.000
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.583
Lovely night for a swim.

19:53.666 --> 19:54.791
[boys chuckling]

19:55.875 --> 19:58.500
[in Spanish] This is Juan Alberto Diaz

19:58.583 --> 20:02.250
coming to you live from the Mexico City
Invitational Chess Tournament

20:02.333 --> 20:04.666
at the Palacio Azteca where

20:04.750 --> 20:10.708
the big story
has been the seventeen-year-old

20:10.791 --> 20:14.375
from Lexington, Kentucky,
Elizabeth Harmon.

20:16.375 --> 20:18.708
[Beth, in English]
Neither of us spoke the other's language.

20:18.791 --> 20:20.250
[man whispering indistinctly]

20:20.916 --> 20:22.666
He opened with a pawn to king four.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.208
I played pawn to queen's bishop four.

20:26.541 --> 20:30.333
In 31 moves,
I had his king in a mating net.

20:31.416 --> 20:32.541
You're a wonder.

20:33.250 --> 20:35.250
[pensive music playing]

20:53.250 --> 20:55.250
[thunder rumbling]

21:15.041 --> 21:16.208
[water splashes]

21:18.416 --> 21:20.666
[Diaz, in Spanish]
Undefeated, this morning she played

21:20.750 --> 21:23.416
the Queen's Gambit Declined

21:23.500 --> 21:25.958
against the Austrian, Diedrich.

21:26.291 --> 21:29.125
Facing relentless pressure
in the middle of the board,

21:29.208 --> 21:32.416
Harmon had him
on his heels from the start.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.916
She did it mostly with pawns,

21:35.000 --> 21:39.916
and crushed his position
as one might crush an egg.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.500
Diedrich played well,

21:41.583 --> 21:45.166
made no blunders or anything
that could properly be called a mistake,

21:45.250 --> 21:48.916
but Harmon moved with such deadly accuracy,
such measured control,

21:49.000 --> 21:50.666
that his position was hopeless

21:50.750 --> 21:53.000
by the 23rd move.

21:53.083 --> 21:55.333
Impressive play by this young woman.

21:55.416 --> 21:56.625
[all laughing]

22:08.416 --> 22:11.333
Borgov retreats his knight,

22:11.416 --> 22:13.375
but he's really attacking
the black knight.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.958
This is a very interesting position.

22:16.041 --> 22:18.291
It is dangerous for both sides.

22:18.708 --> 22:21.750
How is Black going to answer the threat?

22:21.833 --> 22:23.750
[chess clock ticking]

22:23.833 --> 22:26.125
Will he defend himself or counter attack?

22:29.375 --> 22:32.625
It could go either way.

22:40.875 --> 22:42.458
-[door opens]
-Mother?

22:43.500 --> 22:44.541
[Mrs. Wheatley] Out here.

22:48.333 --> 22:49.750
[distant traffic sounds]

22:55.708 --> 22:57.750
[Mrs. Wheatley]
Fresh air feels nice, doesn't it?

22:59.291 --> 23:00.375
Aren't you going out?

23:01.791 --> 23:04.708
No, Manuel's not coming tonight.

23:06.375 --> 23:07.958
He had business in Oaxaca.

23:09.416 --> 23:10.708
Oh.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.291
How long will he be gone?

23:15.250 --> 23:16.458
At least until we leave.

23:18.041 --> 23:18.875
I'm sorry.

23:21.458 --> 23:23.250
I've never been to Oaxaca, but…

23:24.083 --> 23:25.708
I imagine it resembles Denver.

23:28.916 --> 23:30.375
We can have dinner together.

23:31.291 --> 23:33.375
You can take me
to one of the places you know.

23:34.000 --> 23:35.500
Of course. [chuckles ruefully]

23:36.958 --> 23:38.583
It was fun while it lasted.

23:41.541 --> 23:43.541
[anticipatory music playing]

23:52.333 --> 23:53.791
[with Russian accent] Good afternoon.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.916
-[camera shutter clicks]
-I am Georgi Girev.

23:58.000 --> 23:59.333
Beth Harmon.

23:59.416 --> 24:00.500
[Georgi] I'm honored.

24:08.166 --> 24:10.375
-[button clicks]
-[suspenseful music playing]

25:18.375 --> 25:19.500
[Georgi sighs]

25:22.125 --> 25:23.291
It's been five hours.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.750
Perhaps we should adjourn now.

25:28.791 --> 25:30.208
You must seal your move.

25:39.916 --> 25:41.666
Miss Harmon must seal her move now.

25:55.166 --> 25:57.833
Play will resume tomorrow at ten,
before your regular matches.

26:05.583 --> 26:06.500
Miss Harmon.

26:07.833 --> 26:08.666
Yes?

26:09.333 --> 26:10.625
May I ask you something?

26:12.125 --> 26:16.833
In America, I'm told
that one sees films inside the car.

26:17.875 --> 26:18.708
Is this true?

26:20.291 --> 26:21.250
Drive-ins.

26:23.041 --> 26:25.208
You mean drive-in movies?

26:26.125 --> 26:28.541
Yes, Elvis Presley movies.

26:29.125 --> 26:31.083
Debbie Reynolds and Elizabeth Taylor…

26:31.666 --> 26:32.583
That happens?

26:35.000 --> 26:35.833
It does.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.166
I would dig that.

26:45.875 --> 26:47.875
[pensive music playing]

27:00.875 --> 27:02.000
[Mrs. Wheatley moans]

27:13.458 --> 27:14.291

[Georgi] For you, Beth Harmon…

29:35.166 --> 29:37.041
I resign the old-fashioned way.

29:38.250 --> 29:39.666
[chess clock stops ticking]

29:53.416 --> 29:55.333
I've never been to a drive-in, either.

29:58.833 --> 30:00.541
I should not have let you do that.

30:01.125 --> 30:02.083
With the rook.

30:02.666 --> 30:03.500
No.

30:06.625 --> 30:08.791
But you won't let
the next one that tries it.

30:10.875 --> 30:12.625
How old were you
when you started playing?

30:14.000 --> 30:15.041
Four.

30:15.708 --> 30:17.375
I was district champion at seven.

30:19.666 --> 30:21.625
I will be world champion one day.

30:21.708 --> 30:22.541
When?

30:23.833 --> 30:24.708
In three years.

30:25.208 --> 30:26.875
You'll be 16 in three years.

30:28.750 --> 30:29.583
If you win…

30:31.708 --> 30:32.833
what will you do next?

30:35.500 --> 30:37.291
I-I don't understand.

30:37.375 --> 30:38.958
If you're world champion at 16…

30:40.541 --> 30:42.541
what will you do
with the rest of your life?

30:50.625 --> 30:52.041
I don't understand.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.208
You're the best I've ever played.

31:08.916 --> 31:10.333
Until you play Borgov.

31:19.125 --> 31:21.125
[soft music playing on piano]

[footsteps approaching]

-[piano stops]
-[onlookers applauding]

32:35.541 --> 32:38.916
Everyone, this is Elizabeth Harmon,
the US Champion.

32:39.000 --> 32:40.708
Co-Champion.

32:41.625 --> 32:43.208
I'm sorry I missed your match,

32:43.875 --> 32:45.250
but the bath was so lovely.

32:45.333 --> 32:47.291
I soaked the entire afternoon.

32:48.166 --> 32:49.125
[Beth] I'm glad.

32:49.208 --> 32:51.875
-You look better.
-I feel better.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.166
-Are you hungry?
-Starving.

32:54.250 --> 32:56.000
[man] Thank you.
You play beautiful, señora.

32:56.083 --> 32:57.041
Thank you.

32:58.625 --> 33:00.125
So much for your stage fright.

33:00.208 --> 33:02.250
I play fine as long as it's for fun.

33:03.125 --> 33:04.041
Where shall we go?

33:05.000 --> 33:06.625
Any one of the new places
you've been to?

33:06.708 --> 33:07.541
Mm-hm.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.125
Let's eat in the room.

33:16.875 --> 33:19.541
-[Mrs. Wheatley chews loudly]
-[pensive music playing]

33:23.166 --> 33:24.000

33:33.708 --> 33:36.250
-[elevator dings]
-[man 1] You wanna grab it? Here.

33:46.250 --> 33:47.083
[elevator dings]

33:53.375 --> 33:56.541
[man 2, in Russian] In Moscow, she'll be
jet-lagged. We can destroy her then.

33:56.625 --> 33:58.125
[in Russian] She's getting better.

33:58.625 --> 34:01.083
Have to deal with her here or in Paris

34:01.166 --> 34:03.125
before she gets too strong.

34:03.791 --> 34:05.041
There's talk she's a drunk.

34:05.750 --> 34:07.416
Her game is almost all attack.

34:07.500 --> 34:10.000
So she doesn't always watch her back.

34:10.083 --> 34:12.458
When she blunders, she gets angry,

34:12.541 --> 34:13.458
and can be dangerous.

34:13.541 --> 34:16.875
-[man 3, in Russian] Like all women.
-She's an orphan. A survivor.

34:17.750 --> 34:21.500
She's like us --
losing is not an option for her.

34:22.125 --> 34:25.458
Otherwise, what would her life be?

34:34.041 --> 34:35.208
[elevator dings]

34:38.166 --> 34:39.958
[pensive music continues]

34:57.541 --> 35:00.750
[Mike] Those two guys,
they're number two and three in the world.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.125
-[Beth] And those guys?
-[Matt] KGB.

35:06.333 --> 35:08.041
Make sure Borgov doesn't run away.

35:13.333 --> 35:14.875
Will you save a seat for my mother?

35:15.583 --> 35:16.416
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

35:20.000 --> 35:22.000
[pensive music playing]

35:43.916 --> 35:46.250

You may start your opponent's clock.

35:50.333 --> 35:52.458
-[button clicks]
-[thrilling music playing]

35:54.833 --> 35:56.875
[Diaz, in Spanish] Pawn to king four.

35:56.958 --> 36:00.625
She always plays
the Sicilian to that opening.

36:00.708 --> 36:04.500
It's the most common opening
for White in the game of chess,

36:04.583 --> 36:09.916
and Borgov has been called
the "Master of the Sicilian."

36:11.041 --> 36:14.166
Harmon moves pawn to queen bishop four,

36:14.250 --> 36:18.458
hoping to play him on ground
that's fresh for both of them,

36:18.541 --> 36:21.916
that won't give him
the advantage of his superior knowledge.

36:25.208 --> 36:29.541
And now Borgov has brought out
his king's knight to bishop three,

36:30.500 --> 36:31.458
…and Harmon,

36:31.541 --> 36:33.916
of course,
brings hers to queen bishop three,

36:34.000 --> 36:35.708
attacking the center.

36:40.375 --> 36:44.208
But Borgov moves his bishop
to knight five,

36:44.291 --> 36:48.208
signaling he's going to play
the Closed Sicilian,

36:48.291 --> 36:49.583
not the Open.

36:52.208 --> 36:53.166
[camera shutter clicks]

36:53.250 --> 36:55.416
[director, in English]
Please do not disturb the players.

36:55.500 --> 36:59.250
[in Spanish]
The Rossolimo. A rare opening…

37:12.333 --> 37:14.500
Harmon pushes her pawn

37:15.083 --> 37:17.625
to rook three,
attacking Borgov's bishop.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.541
-[pieces clatter]
-[chess clock button clicks]

37:25.375 --> 37:27.125
[Diaz] Borgov castles.

37:27.208 --> 37:30.083
Harmon must now decide

37:30.166 --> 37:33.583
to open the game or keep it closed.

37:34.375 --> 37:35.625
[Mike] White has the advantage.

37:35.708 --> 37:38.666
Since it always has the first move,
it always has the advantage.

37:38.750 --> 37:41.125
I read that when computers
learn to play chess,

37:41.208 --> 37:42.958
and play against other computers,

37:43.041 --> 37:45.750
White will always win
because of the first move.

37:46.416 --> 37:48.166
Like tic-tac-toe.

37:48.250 --> 37:49.625
Borgov's not a machine.

37:49.708 --> 37:52.750
[Matt chuckles] That you know of.

38:45.958 --> 38:47.291
[Beth] I didn't expect it.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.708
No one really plays it.

38:50.666 --> 38:51.708
It threw me off.

38:52.875 --> 38:54.541
Just like he knew it would.

38:55.458 --> 38:59.208
From that point on, the whole game
was like a foregone conclusion. I…

39:00.125 --> 39:03.416
I couldn't fight this feeling
that I'd already lost.

39:04.083 --> 39:06.833
Like in the books,

39:06.916 --> 39:09.000
where you know the outcome,
but you play it out

39:09.083 --> 39:11.083
just to see how it would happen, and…

39:12.541 --> 39:16.000
I mean, every move he made was so…

39:17.583 --> 39:19.000
obvious, so…

39:19.958 --> 39:22.291
unimaginative, so bureaucratic.

39:24.291 --> 39:26.541
And the whole time, I'd look at his face,

39:27.708 --> 39:28.875
and there was no doubt.

39:30.250 --> 39:31.250
No weakness.

39:33.583 --> 39:35.083
I'm so glad you didn't see it.

39:43.958 --> 39:44.791
Mother?

39:53.458 --> 39:54.541
[light switch clicks]

40:11.416 --> 40:12.291
[exhales shakily]

40:26.583 --> 40:27.625
I'm sorry.

40:28.916 --> 40:29.916
What was it?

40:30.000 --> 40:31.125
Hepatitis, possibly.

40:31.666 --> 40:32.791
We will know tomorrow.

40:34.708 --> 40:36.375
Could you give me a tranquilizer?

40:36.958 --> 40:39.541
-Yes. I have a sedative.
-I don't want a sedative.

40:40.416 --> 40:42.208
Could I have a prescription for Librium?

40:44.291 --> 40:46.541
You don't need a prescription
to buy Librium in Mexico.

40:47.416 --> 40:48.958
I suggest meprobamate.

40:49.875 --> 40:51.750
There's a farmacia here in the hotel.

40:53.583 --> 40:55.416
Again, I'm very sorry for your loss.

41:01.166 --> 41:03.666
Allow us to help you
with any arrangements.

41:04.625 --> 41:07.041
Signing papers, dealing with authorities.

41:08.041 --> 41:10.750
And, of course,
the bill will be taken care of.

41:11.541 --> 41:14.333
-Thank you.
-Including the liquor bill,

41:14.416 --> 41:16.166
which was significant.

41:17.875 --> 41:20.750
Though, I'm sure none
of the many margaritas she consumed

41:20.833 --> 41:23.291
was the culprit
in your mother's untimely passing.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.791
She did mention something
about the quality of the tequila.

41:32.666 --> 41:33.500
Again…

41:34.291 --> 41:35.666
whatever we can do to help.

41:46.875 --> 41:47.875
I need to find him.

42:00.916 --> 42:01.750
Hello?

42:02.250 --> 42:03.458
[manager] I have your call.

42:04.291 --> 42:05.125
From Denver.

42:05.916 --> 42:06.750
Thank you.

42:09.833 --> 42:11.083
This is Allston Wheatley.

42:12.625 --> 42:14.000
It's Beth, Mr. Wheatley.

42:14.875 --> 42:15.708
Beth?

42:16.375 --> 42:17.250
Your daughter.

42:18.625 --> 42:20.791
-Elizabeth Harmon.
-And you're in Mexico?

42:20.875 --> 42:22.333
It's about Mrs. Wheatley.

42:23.208 --> 42:24.958
How is Alma? Is she there with you?

42:26.416 --> 42:27.250
She's dead.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.125
She died this morning.

42:32.791 --> 42:34.541
-Mr. Wheatley--
-Can't you handle this?

42:34.625 --> 42:36.416
I-I can't be going off to Mexico.

42:39.708 --> 42:43.416
There's an autopsy in the morning,
and I have to buy new plane tickets…

42:44.583 --> 42:47.375
I mean, I have to get
a new ticket for myself.

42:51.958 --> 42:55.958
-I don't know where to bury her.
-Call Durgin Brothers in Lexington.

42:56.041 --> 42:58.708
There's a family plot
in her maiden name, Benson.

42:59.833 --> 43:01.041
What about the house?

43:01.125 --> 43:03.375
[sighs]
Look, I don't want any part of this.

43:03.458 --> 43:04.791
I got problems enough in Denver.

43:04.875 --> 43:08.375
Get her up to Kentucky and bury her,
and the house is yours. Just…

43:10.041 --> 43:11.458
make the mortgage payments.

43:12.375 --> 43:13.208
You need money?

43:13.791 --> 43:16.583
I don't know.
I don't know how much it'll cost.

43:16.666 --> 43:19.708
I heard you're doing all right.
The child-prodigy thing.

43:19.791 --> 43:21.166
Can't you charge it or something?

43:23.375 --> 43:24.708
I'll ask the hotel.

43:24.791 --> 43:27.250
Good, you do that.
I'm strapped for cash right now,

43:27.333 --> 43:30.708
but call Second National Bank
and ask for Mr. Erlich.

43:30.791 --> 43:33.083
That's E-R-L-I-C-H.

43:34.041 --> 43:36.041
Say you can have the house.
He knows how to reach me.

43:36.125 --> 43:37.916
Don't you want to know how she died?

43:40.000 --> 43:40.833
What was it?

43:40.916 --> 43:42.083
Hepatitis.

43:43.833 --> 43:45.250
I think. We'll know tomorrow.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.125
Yeah.

43:47.791 --> 43:48.875
She was sick a lot.
