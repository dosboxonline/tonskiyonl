WEBVTT

00:08.416 --> 00:10.416
[wind whistling]

00:13.666 --> 00:15.625
[Jolene] You should have seen yourself.

00:16.625 --> 00:19.666
Up on that stool,
floating around up there,

00:20.583 --> 00:22.958
Deardorff just hollering at you.

00:23.541 --> 00:24.625
It felt funny.

00:24.708 --> 00:25.541
Shit.

00:26.458 --> 00:27.666
I bet it felt good.

00:29.666 --> 00:30.500
[Beth sighs]

00:30.583 --> 00:31.958
What you gonna do at night?

00:33.458 --> 00:36.916
I'm gonna stay awake as long as I can,
reading my book,

00:37.791 --> 00:39.625
learning the Sicilian Defense.

00:42.833 --> 00:45.375
There's 57 pages about it in the book,

00:45.458 --> 00:48.791
with 170 lines stemming from P to QB4.

00:50.583 --> 00:53.583
I'm gonna memorize them
and play through them all in my mind.

00:54.791 --> 00:55.833
Poor mind.

00:57.208 --> 00:59.416
-[girls laughing]
-[woman] Ladies, don't run!

00:59.500 --> 01:00.791
No shoving!

01:00.875 --> 01:02.875
[indistinct chattering and giggling]

01:22.083 --> 01:23.208
[Beth] Mr. Shaibel?

01:28.416 --> 01:30.083
They won't let me play anymore.

01:33.083 --> 01:34.125
I'm being punished.

01:36.875 --> 01:38.041
Please…

01:39.583 --> 01:40.708
can you help me?

01:47.083 --> 01:48.791
[sighs]

01:50.041 --> 01:51.833
I wish I could play more with you.

01:54.958 --> 01:56.958
[somber music playing]

02:11.958 --> 02:13.958
For crying out loud,
what you still doing in bed?

02:14.041 --> 02:15.458
You're gonna miss breakfast.

02:20.833 --> 02:21.750
[Jolene sniffles]

02:41.666 --> 02:42.666
Morning, cracker.

02:43.208 --> 02:44.125
[clears throat]

02:48.875 --> 02:51.708
You don't wanna miss
another delicious breakfast, do you?

02:52.708 --> 02:54.208
[Beth] Been dreaming about it.

03:03.208 --> 03:04.666
[birds chirping]

03:18.583 --> 03:20.000
Wonder who they're here for.

03:55.750 --> 03:56.791
[girls] Hi, Beth.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.750
-Are you trying to piss her off?
-I had to take a shower.

04:06.833 --> 04:07.666
Go on in, then.

04:09.625 --> 04:10.458
Hold up.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.875
They seem like nice people.

04:27.458 --> 04:32.000
I'm told, Elizabeth,
that you turned 13 just last month.

04:32.083 --> 04:33.083
Actually, I'm fift--

04:35.625 --> 04:38.208
Yes, that's right, I'm 13.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.166
Such a wonderful age.

04:41.875 --> 04:44.541
Elizabeth has performed well
in all of her schoolwork.

04:44.625 --> 04:48.833
She is at the top of her class
in reading and arithmetic.

04:48.916 --> 04:50.083
That's very impressive.

04:50.875 --> 04:54.083
Beth is also a very strong student
in science and geography,

04:54.166 --> 04:57.375
and has been kindly assisting
Miss Lonsdale with chapel,

04:57.458 --> 04:59.125
for several years now.

04:59.208 --> 05:01.125
She is the model Methuen girl.

05:02.958 --> 05:04.041
I can see that.

05:06.666 --> 05:08.791
I will leave you three to get acquainted.

05:14.125 --> 05:15.000
[door opens]

05:17.291 --> 05:19.000
-[door closes]
-[man clears throat]

05:21.041 --> 05:22.250
They call you Elizabeth?

05:24.375 --> 05:25.291
Or is it Betty?

05:41.708 --> 05:42.791
You should go pack.

05:48.708 --> 05:50.083
[car engine turns over]

05:59.250 --> 06:00.375
I can't find my book.

06:01.458 --> 06:04.458
Which book we talking about?
You read like a hundred of them.

06:05.125 --> 06:06.708
Modern Chess Openings.

06:06.791 --> 06:09.000
Hm. Beats the shit out of me.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.500
I left it right here.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.791
-You didn't see it, did you?
-Watch who you go accusing.

06:17.750 --> 06:19.541
I got no use for no book like that.

06:20.791 --> 06:22.375
Anyway, you don't need no book.

06:22.458 --> 06:26.583
Just say, "Yes, sir," and "Yes, ma'am,"
and you'll do all right.

06:26.666 --> 06:30.250
Tell them you're grateful
to be in a Christian home like theirs.

06:31.541 --> 06:33.416
Maybe they'll put a TV in your room.

06:36.416 --> 06:37.250
Jolene?

06:38.625 --> 06:39.458
[Jolene] Hm?

06:42.916 --> 06:43.875
I'm sorry.

06:44.458 --> 06:45.291
About what?

06:47.208 --> 06:48.625
That you didn't get adopted.

06:53.041 --> 06:53.875
Shit.

06:55.125 --> 06:57.416
I make out just fine right here.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
[pensive music playing]

07:14.625 --> 07:16.166
Be a good girl, Elizabeth.

07:23.125 --> 07:24.500
Off we go!

07:31.041 --> 07:32.500
[sighs]

07:45.625 --> 07:47.583
We're so glad to have an older child.

08:00.666 --> 08:02.875
[man sniffs, clears throat]

08:05.375 --> 08:07.375
[uplifting music playing]

08:39.458 --> 08:40.291
Shall we?

08:46.375 --> 08:47.208
[door closes]

08:57.875 --> 08:59.041
Home sweet home.

09:08.083 --> 09:10.000
[woman] Those are Rosa Bonheur prints.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.166
Not originals, of course.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.000
Do you like animals?

09:19.083 --> 09:20.291
I do, I love them.

09:20.375 --> 09:22.750
Allston is allergic
to most pet dander, though,

09:22.833 --> 09:24.833
-so I'm not allowed to--
-[Allston clears throat]

09:29.208 --> 09:31.250
I bet you'd like to see your room.

09:36.958 --> 09:40.375
This is the master bedroom,
where Allston and I sleep.

09:42.208 --> 09:44.833
Over here is the bathroom,

09:45.333 --> 09:47.875
and this is you.

10:02.208 --> 10:05.500
You have no idea how hard it is
to find good maple furniture.

10:05.583 --> 10:06.708
This is all mine?

10:07.583 --> 10:08.916
Of course it's all yours.

10:10.083 --> 10:11.000
The whole room?

10:11.083 --> 10:12.208
The whole room.

10:17.375 --> 10:18.208
All right.

10:19.583 --> 10:21.750
I will let you unpack and get settled in.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Just give a holler if you need anything.

10:29.708 --> 10:30.541
[lock clicks]

10:35.708 --> 10:36.833
Home sweet home.

10:38.041 --> 10:40.041
[uplifting music continues]

10:40.125 --> 10:41.041
[exhales]

10:48.083 --> 10:49.208
[woman] I don't understand.

10:49.708 --> 10:52.541
[Allston] I don't know exactly
what there is to understand.

10:52.625 --> 10:55.708
-[woman] Why can't they send someone else?
-[Allston] It's only for two weeks.

10:55.791 --> 10:57.791
[woman]
You've only been home for two days.

10:57.875 --> 11:00.708
[Allston] Gives you some time
to get to know your new companion.

11:01.208 --> 11:02.333
I doubt there's much to know.

11:02.416 --> 11:04.625
Girl doesn't seem
to have a heck of a lot to say.

11:05.541 --> 11:07.208
[woman] Do you have to take the car?

11:07.500 --> 11:09.458
How am I supposed
to get around without a car?

11:09.541 --> 11:11.375
I don't know, you could rent one.

11:11.458 --> 11:14.541
And eat up half my commissions?
You're a terrible driver anyway.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.458
It's not that far into town.

11:16.958 --> 11:19.708
Remember what the doctor said.
Some exercise will do you good.

11:20.208 --> 11:22.000
-[car door shuts]
-[engine turns over]

11:31.500 --> 11:32.666
[car drives away]

11:32.750 --> 11:34.750
[melancholy music playing on piano]

11:47.250 --> 11:48.333
[woman] It's early, dear.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.291
You don't have to be up
for another hour yet.

11:53.875 --> 11:56.750
Must be all the excitement
about your first day of school.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.916
Where did Mr. Wheatley go?

12:03.500 --> 12:04.583
Business trip.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.375
Poor man has to travel
quite a bit these days, but…

12:08.458 --> 12:10.000
as he likes to remind me, it…

12:11.041 --> 12:12.666
keeps the roof over our heads.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.625
Please stop gawking, dear,
you're making me nervous.

12:32.000 --> 12:32.875
You're very good.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.000
This was Grandmother June's piano.

12:38.375 --> 12:40.458
I've played since I was younger than you.

12:42.166 --> 12:45.000
I'd always had it in my mind
to one day play in an orchestra.

12:45.916 --> 12:47.000
Probably still could.

12:47.083 --> 12:49.041
Mmm. As luck would have it,

12:49.125 --> 12:52.125
I've also always suffered
from a terrible case of stage fright,

12:52.875 --> 12:55.375
which does not bode well
for an aspiring performer.

12:56.958 --> 12:58.166
And then I got pregnant.

13:01.208 --> 13:02.083
You have a child?

13:04.958 --> 13:06.250
We did, yes.

13:14.166 --> 13:15.291
Are you hungry?

13:16.291 --> 13:17.791
We have a leftover casserole.

13:19.708 --> 13:20.875
[Mrs. Wheatley] Beth, dear.

13:24.166 --> 13:26.250
Are you sure
you don't want me to go with you?

13:27.375 --> 13:28.208
[Beth] I'm okay.

13:29.583 --> 13:30.416
Okay.

13:37.291 --> 13:39.291
[uplifting orchestral music playing]

14:10.708 --> 14:12.708
[students chattering indistinctly]

14:15.583 --> 14:17.666
[girl 1] You should have seen that coach.

14:18.541 --> 14:20.916
Have you seen her hair and her shoes?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
[girls laugh]

14:24.333 --> 14:25.333
[girl 2] Don't know.

14:25.416 --> 14:27.000
[girls continue indistinctly]

14:28.125 --> 14:29.000
[girl 2] So drab.

14:29.083 --> 14:31.583
And brown laces
with brown shoes? I mean… [scoffs]

14:32.125 --> 14:34.416
[teacher] Quiet, please! Let's start.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.666
This week, we will begin to study
the binomial theorem.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.375
Does anyone know what a binomial is?

14:41.875 --> 14:42.708
Anyone?

14:43.250 --> 14:44.416
[student clears throat]

14:49.875 --> 14:50.916
[teacher] Yes?

14:51.000 --> 14:53.750
-A binomial is a mathematical--
-Will you stand up, please?

15:00.083 --> 15:03.833
A binomial is a mathematical expression
containing two terms.

15:05.083 --> 15:06.958
X plus Y is a binomial.

15:08.208 --> 15:09.125
Very good.

15:09.208 --> 15:11.291
Let's turn to page 24.

15:11.375 --> 15:13.625
[whispering] Great, another fucking brain.

15:13.708 --> 15:14.833
[girl chuckles]

15:17.041 --> 15:19.041
[indistinct chatter]

15:19.666 --> 15:21.583
[girl] That's a good idea. Oh, my god.

15:23.166 --> 15:24.625
[tittering]

15:48.125 --> 15:49.166
[tray slams]

16:03.666 --> 16:04.875
[clears throat]

16:08.583 --> 16:10.416
-Is there a school chess club?
-What?

16:11.166 --> 16:14.208
Is there a chess club here at the school?

16:14.291 --> 16:15.291
Oh.

16:16.083 --> 16:16.916
Um…

16:17.833 --> 16:19.625
I don't think they have
anything like that.

16:27.666 --> 16:30.083
But a lot of the girls
belong to social clubs.

16:30.166 --> 16:31.458
Social clubs?

16:32.916 --> 16:34.375
There's the Apple Pi club,

16:35.166 --> 16:36.750
and the Sub Debs,

16:37.333 --> 16:40.166
-and Girls Around Town.
-Apple pie? They bake pies?

16:40.250 --> 16:43.833
No, Apple Pi.
You know, like the Greek letter.

16:45.250 --> 16:46.083
Oh.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.125
Are you in one of those?

16:49.833 --> 16:51.708
You have to be invited…

16:52.458 --> 16:53.291
to join.

16:59.750 --> 17:02.125
You could try out for junior cheerleader.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.083
[vacuum cleaner whirring loudly]

17:11.791 --> 17:13.750
[Mrs. Wheatley yelps] Shit.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.250
[footsteps ascend rapidly]

17:16.333 --> 17:17.375
[door opens]

17:18.208 --> 17:20.083
-[Allston sighs]
-[door closes]

17:21.541 --> 17:23.166
[Allston clears throat]

17:23.750 --> 17:24.958
Hello, Mr. Wheatley.

17:26.541 --> 17:27.375
Oh.

17:28.291 --> 17:30.208
Hi… Beth.

17:30.291 --> 17:33.458
[Mrs. Wheatley] You're home!
I didn't expect you for another week.

17:33.541 --> 17:34.666
I'm only here for the night.

17:34.750 --> 17:37.416
They, uh…
they just gave me the whole Southwest, so…

17:39.125 --> 17:41.333
-[kiss]
-[Mrs. Wheatley] And a raise, I hope?

17:41.416 --> 17:42.625
[Allston] Don't start.

17:43.291 --> 17:45.708
Yes, why don't you freshen up,
and I will start dinner?

17:45.791 --> 17:46.875
I'll take a beer.

17:48.041 --> 17:49.125
If there's any left.

17:53.333 --> 17:55.083
Doesn't she ever change clothes?

18:03.458 --> 18:05.500
I don't think he likes me very much.

18:05.583 --> 18:06.833
Quite the opposite.

18:07.625 --> 18:09.708
Adopting you was actually his idea.

18:11.583 --> 18:13.875
He's right, though.
You could use some new clothes.

18:15.500 --> 18:17.750
-[bus screeches to stop]
-[doors squeak open]

18:24.083 --> 18:25.041
[bus driver] Sorry.

18:43.541 --> 18:44.916
[indistinct conversations]

18:46.083 --> 18:48.166
[cheerful music playing over speakers]

18:56.583 --> 18:57.666
[Mrs. Wheatley] Aha!

19:14.583 --> 19:15.666
They have chess sets.

19:18.083 --> 19:19.750
We can stop on the way back down.

19:36.875 --> 19:37.875
[Mrs. Wheatley] Oh…

19:40.166 --> 19:41.416
Let's find you a blouse.

19:45.166 --> 19:47.208
Well, don't you look lovely?

19:48.583 --> 19:50.291
[Beth] The shoes are a little big.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.458
Room to grow, dear.
Room to grow.

19:53.541 --> 19:54.708
Let's look for coats.

19:58.291 --> 20:00.083
Mmm. Lovely.

20:01.458 --> 20:04.333
Step over here
so I can see the fabric in the light.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.041
Yes, this will do nicely.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.625
Aren't we gonna look at the chess sets?

20:19.833 --> 20:21.208
Another time, dear.

20:21.291 --> 20:23.666
It's getting late, and I'm getting hungry.

20:24.791 --> 20:27.000
-But--
-I'll give you 40 cents a week allowance.

20:28.333 --> 20:30.208
Save up and buy yourself a chess set.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.166
Saving is a good lesson
for a girl to learn.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.833
[students chatting indistinctly]

20:48.500 --> 20:49.625
[girls titter]

20:52.208 --> 20:53.833
[tittering]

21:01.125 --> 21:03.125
[girls laugh tauntingly]

21:03.916 --> 21:06.000
-[thud]
-[girls giggle]

21:07.708 --> 21:08.875
[girl] So bad!

21:11.250 --> 21:12.541
[items clatter in locker]

21:18.666 --> 21:19.500
[clears throat]

21:24.250 --> 21:26.833
-Do you have any books on chess?
-[librarian] Chess?

21:26.916 --> 21:28.375
Mm. I don't know for sure.

21:29.208 --> 21:31.583
If we have anything,
it'll be on the last row.

21:32.416 --> 21:33.458
Thank you.

21:33.541 --> 21:36.041
There might be an old biography
on José Capablanca.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.541
-Who?
-José Capablanca.

21:42.333 --> 21:45.625
He was a Grandmaster.
It was quite a long time ago now.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.083
What's a Grandmaster?

21:49.166 --> 21:50.541
A genius player.

22:07.166 --> 22:10.500
[kissing, heavy breathing]

22:28.958 --> 22:30.958
[girl breathing heavily]

22:36.625 --> 22:37.583
[girl] Okay, yeah.

22:38.250 --> 22:39.458
I see you, Harmon.

22:40.458 --> 22:41.625
It's those shoes.

22:42.458 --> 22:44.708
Did you get them
at Ben Snyder's or something?

22:46.291 --> 22:48.916
I wouldn't be caught dead
in Ben Snyder's.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.000
[boy chuckles]

22:56.041 --> 22:56.875
[door closes]

22:57.625 --> 22:59.875
-[Mrs. Wheatley] How was school?
-Fun.

23:00.708 --> 23:01.708
Where are you going?

23:03.750 --> 23:05.791
I'm gonna replay
some of the matches in this book.

23:06.666 --> 23:08.833
-But you don't have a board.
-In my head.

23:09.666 --> 23:11.166
Good mental exercise.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.958
Well, some physical exercise
could do you good.

23:16.041 --> 23:20.125
Will you run over to Bradley's for me,

23:20.208 --> 23:22.500
and pick up three packs of Chesterfields?

23:23.375 --> 23:24.208
Yes, ma'am.

23:30.625 --> 23:31.750
I'll write you a note.

23:32.750 --> 23:35.583
You look a bit youthful
for smoking, yourself. [chuckles]

23:36.250 --> 23:37.416
[rain pattering]

23:50.916 --> 23:51.750
[bell dings]

23:58.166 --> 23:59.000
[door closes]

23:59.083 --> 24:01.541
[sports announcer
speaking indistinctly on radio]

24:08.750 --> 24:09.750
[Beth clears throat]

24:37.458 --> 24:40.000
[pensive music playing]

25:11.125 --> 25:12.208
[Bradley] Young lady!

25:13.375 --> 25:16.000
You have to buy the magazine
or put it back.

25:17.250 --> 25:19.583
-Can't I just--
-You wanna read? Read the sign.

25:37.000 --> 25:40.458
[Bradley] No, it's all the same oil,
it's just three different sizes.

25:46.083 --> 25:48.208
If you don't use a lot,
you wanna buy that one,

25:48.291 --> 25:51.500
because it does go bad,
but this is the best value for the money.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.750
If you can't decide, get the middle one.
It's not rocket science.

26:00.000 --> 26:02.000
[uplifting orchestral music playing]

26:05.791 --> 26:06.916
[utensils clattering]

26:12.083 --> 26:13.500
[Mrs. Wheatley] Thank you, dear.

26:19.166 --> 26:22.291
Well, that's the last
of the instant coffee.

26:23.208 --> 26:26.750
I'd go shopping, but I just don't know
where all the money goes.

26:27.291 --> 26:29.125
I've bought little more
than trifles this month,

26:29.208 --> 26:32.000
and yet I have seven dollars left
where I should have at least 20.

26:32.083 --> 26:33.000
Seven dollars?

26:34.041 --> 26:36.708
-Is that enough?
-To last till the end of October?

26:36.791 --> 26:37.625
I think not.

26:38.125 --> 26:40.625
It'll scarcely buy
chicken necks and porridge.

26:40.708 --> 26:43.791
-Doesn't Methuen send you a check?
-For 80 dollars.

26:43.875 --> 26:45.625
And only for the first year.

26:45.708 --> 26:48.375
As if the expense of keeping you
doesn't exhaust it.

26:51.750 --> 26:53.625
I'm afraid you'll have to go
without an allowance

26:53.708 --> 26:54.916
until Allston returns.

26:56.625 --> 26:57.750
Which is when?

26:57.833 --> 26:58.750
Who can say?

27:00.250 --> 27:03.083
It seems he's been
unavoidably detained out West.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.000
Maybe I could get a job.

27:12.083 --> 27:13.000
A job?

27:13.083 --> 27:16.166
I could work in a store,
or wash dishes somewhere.

27:16.250 --> 27:17.375
Wash dishes?

27:17.458 --> 27:18.875
I'd like to make some money.

27:19.458 --> 27:21.708
Oh, to buy clothes with, I suspect.

27:23.916 --> 27:25.291
To enter chess tournaments.

27:26.583 --> 27:27.458
There's one here.

27:28.833 --> 27:30.958
But it's five dollars
for the entrance fee.

27:32.041 --> 27:34.416
The only girls of your age
who work are colored.

27:38.291 --> 27:39.500
[Beth] Dear Mr. Shaibel,

27:40.166 --> 27:44.333
there's a chess tournament here
with a first prize of 100 dollars,

27:44.416 --> 27:46.375
and a second prize of 50 dollars.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.791
There are other prizes, too.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.208
[thoughtful music playing]

27:51.916 --> 27:55.041
It costs five dollars to enter,
and I don't have that.

27:59.958 --> 28:01.250
If you'll send me the money,

28:01.333 --> 28:04.750
I will pay you back ten dollars
if I win any prize at all.

28:08.625 --> 28:09.875
[Alma coughing]

28:12.708 --> 28:14.416
[Alma] Beth, is that you?

28:18.875 --> 28:21.083
[chuckles] I seem to have caught a cold.

28:21.791 --> 28:22.625
Another one?

28:22.708 --> 28:25.250
Mm. I have a proclivity for viruses, or…

28:26.250 --> 28:27.625
they for me. [chuckles]

28:28.458 --> 28:30.416
Uh… here.

28:31.750 --> 28:33.916
I need you
to fill this prescription for me.

28:35.125 --> 28:36.291
And while you're there…

28:37.750 --> 28:39.416
buy yourself a Coke. [chuckles]

28:39.916 --> 28:41.541
[TV playing indistinctly]

28:42.708 --> 28:44.041
-Thanks.
-[chuckles]

28:44.916 --> 28:47.333
[sports announcer speaks indistinctly
over radio]

28:48.333 --> 28:49.208
Be just a minute.

28:59.708 --> 29:01.708
[pills clattering]

29:04.333 --> 29:05.291
[Bradley] Here you go.

29:12.791 --> 29:14.958
[Mrs. Wheatley] My tranquility medicine.
[chuckles]

29:17.666 --> 29:21.791
Dr. Talbott has decided
I need more tranquility. Much more.

29:23.208 --> 29:25.833
-Will you get me a glass of water, dear?
-Yes, ma'am.

29:27.125 --> 29:29.500
Why do they
only fill these bottles half full?

29:31.083 --> 29:32.500
[pensive music playing]

29:40.000 --> 29:41.000
[sighs]

29:59.541 --> 30:00.875
[fabric ripping]

30:04.583 --> 30:05.416
[sighs]

30:21.083 --> 30:23.083
[music intensifies]

30:37.875 --> 30:39.583
-[thud]
-Excuse you, Harmon.

30:39.666 --> 30:40.666
Fuck you, Margaret.

30:41.416 --> 30:42.458
[Mrs. Wheatley] Beth,

30:42.541 --> 30:43.625
this came for you.

30:54.833 --> 30:55.666
Thank you.

30:57.458 --> 30:58.291
Mm-hm.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.500
[footsteps receding]

31:31.708 --> 31:33.166
Tell Alma to go easy.

31:33.791 --> 31:35.500
She's only got three refills left.

31:39.708 --> 31:42.791
For a trip the White House
again calls non-political…

31:43.375 --> 31:45.708
-[Alma] You're home late.
-…political-looking escort

31:45.791 --> 31:48.375
of 17 Democratic congressmen,
and Mrs. Kennedy…

31:48.458 --> 31:51.208
-I was out walking.
-…who was featured at the arrival…

31:51.291 --> 31:53.041
Okay. Good night.

31:54.166 --> 31:55.000
Good night.

31:55.083 --> 31:56.791
…turning on the smile that hasn't been…

31:56.875 --> 31:58.041
[Beth] Oh, um…

31:59.625 --> 32:03.250
I'm gonna be late again tomorrow.
I have something after school.

32:04.208 --> 32:05.375
Have you joined a club?

32:05.875 --> 32:08.375
I'm playing in that chess tournament
I told you about.

32:10.500 --> 32:13.000
I won't argue
that broadening one's social life

32:13.083 --> 32:15.125
is important for a girl your age.

32:15.208 --> 32:17.958
I just wonder whether a dance class
or a girls' club

32:18.041 --> 32:20.166
wouldn't be better for making friendships.

32:21.041 --> 32:22.875
I hear Fairfield has pretty good ones.

32:23.833 --> 32:26.750
When you were my age,
how did you broaden your social life?

32:28.625 --> 32:30.291
The tournament goes until Sunday.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.375
[pensive music playing]

32:57.208 --> 32:59.125
-Do you have a clock?
-No.

32:59.208 --> 33:02.333
We have a clock-sharing system.
If your opponent doesn't have one,

33:02.416 --> 33:03.958
come back, and we'll loan you one.

33:04.041 --> 33:06.208
Play starts in 20 minutes.

33:06.291 --> 33:07.500
What's your rating?

33:08.250 --> 33:09.375
I don't have a rating.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.875
-Have you played in a tournament before?
-No.

33:15.791 --> 33:18.333
-Are you sure you wanna do this?
-I'm sure.

33:18.416 --> 33:20.208
We don't have a women's section.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.166
-I'll put you in beginners.
-I'm not a beginner.

33:24.250 --> 33:25.250
[man] Doesn't matter.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.416
If you're an unrated player,

33:27.500 --> 33:29.833
you go in beginners
with the people under 1600.

33:32.250 --> 33:34.083
-What's the prize for beginners?
-Twenty.

33:34.166 --> 33:36.875
-What about the other section?
-First prize in the Open is 100.

33:36.958 --> 33:39.208
Is it against any rule
for me to be in the Open?

33:39.291 --> 33:41.750
-Not exactly.
-Put me in the Open.

33:42.500 --> 33:45.375
There are three guys in there
with ratings over 1800.

33:45.875 --> 33:47.041
And Beltik may show up.

33:47.625 --> 33:48.833
They will eat you alive.

33:54.458 --> 33:55.291
"Harmon."

33:55.833 --> 33:58.458
-[exciting music playing]
-[indistinct conversations]

34:44.875 --> 34:46.875
[music slows pensively]

34:48.000 --> 34:49.666
Are the matches played at random?

34:50.166 --> 34:51.041
Oh, not at all.

34:52.583 --> 34:53.416
Uh…

34:54.500 --> 34:57.625
Uh, they arrange it by ratings
on the first round.

34:59.125 --> 35:02.375
After that, winners play winners,
and losers, losers.

35:07.083 --> 35:07.916
Good luck.

35:09.916 --> 35:10.750
You, too.

35:21.916 --> 35:22.875
[man] Hi.

35:28.458 --> 35:29.625
Hi.

35:31.125 --> 35:33.000
-Annette Packer.
-Beth Harmon.

35:35.708 --> 35:37.833
-I don't understand about chess clocks.
-Oh.

35:38.500 --> 35:39.333
Um…

35:39.750 --> 35:42.041
The clock faced nearest you
measures your playing time.

35:42.125 --> 35:44.000
Each player has 90 minutes.

35:44.083 --> 35:46.625
After you move,
you press that button on top,

35:46.708 --> 35:48.750
and it stops your clock
and starts your opponent's.

35:48.833 --> 35:52.125
And you see that little red flag
over the number 12 on each clock?

35:52.208 --> 35:54.250
Yours will fall down
when the 90 minutes is up,

35:54.333 --> 35:55.708
and if it does that…

35:57.375 --> 35:58.208
you've lost.

35:58.291 --> 35:59.500
And, um…

36:01.083 --> 36:02.333
For recording your moves.

36:02.416 --> 36:03.416
Right. [chuckles]

36:09.791 --> 36:12.791
-You can start your clocks now.
-You can start my clock now.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.041
Why do they put the girls together?

36:15.125 --> 36:16.333
They're not supposed to…

36:17.000 --> 36:19.375
but, if you win, they move you up.

36:20.708 --> 36:22.375
-[button clicks]
-[clock ticking]

36:23.166 --> 36:25.583
-[Annette] Oh, it's touch move.
-[Beth] What's that?

36:25.666 --> 36:28.250
Don't touch a piece
unless you're going to move it.

36:28.333 --> 36:30.375
If you touch it,
you have to move it somewhere.

36:30.458 --> 36:31.375
Okay.

36:36.416 --> 36:38.000
Don't you push your button now?

36:39.583 --> 36:40.416
Sorry.

36:44.916 --> 36:46.000
What I do with this?

36:47.583 --> 36:48.791
Is your match over?

36:48.875 --> 36:50.000
Yes, I won.

36:51.791 --> 36:52.708
That was fast.

36:54.083 --> 36:55.250
What do I do with this?

36:55.875 --> 36:58.000
Circle your name
and drop it in the basket.

37:21.875 --> 37:23.875
[gentle orchestral music playing]

38:09.208 --> 38:10.708
[chess clock ticking]

38:12.833 --> 38:15.500
-[Beth] Who are they?
-[man whispering] Beltik and Cullen.

38:15.583 --> 38:18.500
-Beltik's the State Champion.
-[in normal voice] Which is which?

38:22.125 --> 38:25.125
-[whispering] Beltik's the younger one.
-Is he a Grandmaster?

38:25.208 --> 38:26.208
He's working on it.

38:26.291 --> 38:27.333
Takes time.

38:28.250 --> 38:30.416
You have to play Grandmasters
to become one.

38:30.500 --> 38:32.625
-[in normal voice] How much time?
-Do you mind?

38:39.791 --> 38:40.625
Draw?

38:43.916 --> 38:45.083
Hell, no.

38:53.500 --> 38:54.708
Yes!

38:54.791 --> 38:56.125
[applauding]

39:05.291 --> 39:06.666
[pensive music playing]

39:33.166 --> 39:34.375
That's check.

39:35.500 --> 39:36.625
I know what it is.

39:47.083 --> 39:48.041
[man clears throat]

39:49.166 --> 39:50.166
Draw?

39:58.375 --> 39:59.208
You got me.

39:59.291 --> 40:00.250
I resign.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.083
[water running]

40:27.333 --> 40:28.166
Dinner break.

40:28.708 --> 40:31.625
Next round is at six o'clock.
Then, three more tomorrow.

40:32.250 --> 40:33.791
Final round is Sunday, 11 a.m.

40:39.791 --> 40:40.708
[man] Harmon?

40:42.125 --> 40:42.958
Keep it up, kid.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.125
[man 1 on TV]
I think he knew you killed his brother.

40:50.500 --> 40:52.916
-You're in trouble…
-Yours is in the oven.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.500
[man 2] Someone's always crowding me.

40:54.583 --> 40:57.375
-How did you do at your thing?
-I won four games.

40:58.625 --> 41:00.416
That's nice, good for you.

41:10.750 --> 41:11.666
Yes, Harmon?

41:11.750 --> 41:14.583
You said there were three people here
with a rating higher than 1800.

41:14.666 --> 41:17.458
-That's right.
-I thought I'd be playing one of them.

41:17.541 --> 41:18.875
Them's the breaks, Harmon.

41:18.958 --> 41:20.166
Consider yourself lucky.

41:20.708 --> 41:22.083
I want to play the best.

41:22.166 --> 41:24.541
You have to get a rating
before that happens.

41:24.625 --> 41:25.916
How do I get a rating?

41:26.000 --> 41:29.250
You play 30 games in USCF tournaments,
then wait four months.

41:29.916 --> 41:32.250
-That's how you get a rating.
-That's too long.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.166
I want to play Beltik.

41:34.250 --> 41:37.333
If you win your next three games,
and if Beltik does the same.

41:37.416 --> 41:38.375
I will win them.

41:38.458 --> 41:42.250
No, Harmon, you won't. You have to play
Sizemore or Goldman first.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.625
You can't beat either of them.

41:43.708 --> 41:46.125
Sizemore and Goldman? Shit.

41:46.208 --> 41:48.750
Townes, the guy you're playing now,
is underrated.

41:48.833 --> 41:51.250
He plays first board
for the university team,

41:51.333 --> 41:53.541
and last month
he came in fifth in Las Vegas.

41:55.041 --> 41:56.583
[snickers]

42:02.166 --> 42:03.166
What's in Las Vegas?

42:03.708 --> 42:04.833
The US Open.

42:06.958 --> 42:08.958
[pensive music playing]

42:22.500 --> 42:24.333
Looks like we've been stalking each other.

42:40.125 --> 42:41.333
You want to start my clock?

42:42.625 --> 42:43.500
[chuckles softly]

42:47.500 --> 42:48.333
Sorry.

44:25.041 --> 44:27.583
Jesus Christ, Harmon,
you're humiliating my rook.

44:28.250 --> 44:30.041
He won't have to suffer much longer.

44:57.000 --> 44:57.833
Damn.

45:04.625 --> 45:05.458
How old are you?

45:06.375 --> 45:07.250
Never mind.

45:07.333 --> 45:10.583
-Don't answer that, it'll just depress me.
-I'm 36.

45:10.666 --> 45:11.583
[chuckles]

45:12.166 --> 45:13.000
Thank you.

45:14.708 --> 45:17.250
You really are something, you know that?

45:22.208 --> 45:23.833
Shall we turn in our sheets?

45:26.250 --> 45:28.416
Um… you go ahead.

45:28.500 --> 45:31.291
I'm gonna study the board a little longer.

45:32.416 --> 45:33.250
Wow.

45:42.500 --> 45:43.333
[groans softly]

45:49.583 --> 45:50.833
[whispering] Damn it!

45:55.916 --> 45:57.833
[cries out] Damn!

46:01.208 --> 46:02.291
[bathroom door opens]

46:03.250 --> 46:06.666
[Annette] I just wanted to tell you
that I've never seen anything like…

46:07.291 --> 46:08.333
Um…

46:08.416 --> 46:09.958
Do-- Do you have something?

46:11.250 --> 46:12.500
It's my first time.

46:15.125 --> 46:15.958
Um…

46:19.333 --> 46:20.750
Do you know how to use it?

46:22.958 --> 46:23.791
I think so.

46:24.750 --> 46:26.583
I'll wait, just in case.

46:28.041 --> 46:30.041
[bathroom stall locks]

46:32.000 --> 46:33.083
[Annette] You're, uh…

46:33.166 --> 46:35.083
You're moving right on up, aren't you?

46:36.333 --> 46:37.166
So far.

46:40.333 --> 46:42.208
Sizemore's pretty tough, though.

46:42.291 --> 46:43.291
[Beth] Uh-huh.

46:49.083 --> 46:50.041
[lock slides open]

46:57.666 --> 46:58.791
[water running]

47:02.125 --> 47:02.958
Thank you.

47:04.666 --> 47:05.541
I didn't…

47:06.916 --> 47:07.791
I just thought…

47:10.958 --> 47:11.958
Thought I was sick.

47:12.833 --> 47:15.208
My first time, I threw up.

47:16.625 --> 47:18.625
Well, I still do sometimes.

47:20.208 --> 47:21.791
Actually, every time.

47:24.291 --> 47:26.833
Well, I have to get back.

47:26.916 --> 47:27.750
Oh, sure.

47:29.875 --> 47:30.791
Hey, Beth.

47:32.125 --> 47:33.416
Beat him, will you?

47:34.625 --> 47:35.458
I'll try.

47:46.791 --> 47:49.083
[Sizemore clears throat] Ready?

[door closes]

48:09.833 --> 48:12.708
[gentle music playing on piano]

48:19.250 --> 48:20.791
I've started menstruating.

48:25.333 --> 48:27.250
Bit late in the day for you, isn't it?

48:31.666 --> 48:32.791
I'll need pads…

48:34.166 --> 48:35.416
something.

48:35.500 --> 48:38.125
Just go up to my room,
to the top drawer of my chiffonier,

48:38.208 --> 48:39.583
and take what you require.

48:43.041 --> 48:43.916
Oh, and, dear…

48:45.458 --> 48:49.416
be a good girl and get that little bottle
of green pills by my bedside.

48:51.875 --> 48:54.291
My tranquility needs to be refurbished.

48:59.666 --> 49:01.666
[muffled busy signal through phone]

49:37.458 --> 49:38.291
Thank you.

49:42.541 --> 49:43.500
Is something wrong?

49:45.791 --> 49:46.625
Wrong?

49:47.208 --> 49:48.166
[sarcastic chuckle]

49:48.958 --> 49:50.375
I'm not Aristotle, but yes,

49:50.458 --> 49:52.708
I think something
could be construed as wrong.

49:55.208 --> 49:57.333
I've received a message from Mr. Wheatley.

49:59.708 --> 50:00.541
What did he say?

50:02.833 --> 50:04.375
It seems Mr. Wheatley…

50:05.458 --> 50:08.333
has been indefinitely detained
in the Southwest.

50:11.375 --> 50:13.333
Somewhere between Denver and Butte.

50:16.958 --> 50:20.416
Though, Aristotle was a moral philosopher,
and I'm just a housewife.

50:22.541 --> 50:23.666
Or I was a housewife.

50:28.208 --> 50:30.916
Can they send me back
if you no longer have a husband?

50:35.541 --> 50:36.875
You put it concretely.

50:43.333 --> 50:44.875
They won't if we lie about it.

50:48.166 --> 50:49.166
That's easy enough.

50:56.125 --> 50:58.458
You're a good soul, Beth.
[sniffles]

51:01.791 --> 51:04.416
Why don't you heat up the chicken dinners
in the freezer, okay?

51:06.208 --> 51:07.666
Set the oven at 400.

51:10.458 --> 51:12.375
I don't know how to put these on.

51:21.041 --> 51:22.958
Though I'm no longer a wife,

51:23.875 --> 51:25.583
except by a legal fiction…

51:30.541 --> 51:32.708
I believe I can learn to be a mother.

51:37.875 --> 51:38.791
I'll show you how…

51:40.583 --> 51:42.583
if you promise to never go near Denver.

51:46.750 --> 51:48.750
[clock ticking]

52:14.833 --> 52:15.750
[young Beth] Mama?

53:08.083 --> 53:09.458
Extra cup of coffee.

53:09.541 --> 53:10.833
[slurps]

53:13.083 --> 53:14.750
Harry Beltik. What's your name?

53:16.083 --> 53:17.000
Beth Harmon.

55:49.166 --> 55:50.250
[Beth] Be right back.

56:09.916 --> 56:12.083
Come on, you ugly piece of trash.

56:13.666 --> 56:14.666
You can beat that…

56:16.791 --> 56:17.750
fucker.

-Son of a bitch.
-I think that's it.

57:48.708 --> 57:51.208
-No, I can get out of this.
-I don't think so.

57:53.125 --> 57:55.250
Maybe, if you'd gotten here on time.

58:07.000 --> 58:07.833
It doesn't work.

58:07.916 --> 58:09.666
-I don't have to use the queen.
-Move.

58:09.750 --> 58:11.833
-I'll just cover it with the bishop and--
-Move.

58:46.791 --> 58:48.000
[Beth] Do you see it now?

58:49.000 --> 58:51.166
Or should we finish this on the board?

58:56.750 --> 58:57.916
Son of a bitch.

[onlookers applauding]

[Alma] "The world of Kentucky
chess was astonished this weekend

59:15.708 --> 59:19.583
by the playing of a local girl
who triumphed over hardened players

59:19.666 --> 59:22.125
to win the Kentucky State Championship."

59:22.916 --> 59:26.666
"Elizabeth Harmon,
a student at Fairfield High,

59:26.750 --> 59:30.291
showed a mastery of the game
unequaled by any female,

59:32.083 --> 59:34.416
whom Miss Harmon defeated
for the state crown."

59:36.458 --> 59:37.750
And 100 dollars.

59:39.416 --> 59:40.250
You won this.

59:40.333 --> 59:41.916
I wanna open a bank account.

59:42.791 --> 59:45.791
But you have to go with me,
because I need a parent or a guardian.

59:45.875 --> 59:49.708
I just didn't have the faintest idea
that people made money playing chess.

59:49.791 --> 59:52.250
There's tournaments
with bigger prizes than that.

59:54.541 --> 59:55.416
How much bigger?

59:57.541 --> 59:58.625
Thousands of dollars.

59:59.708 --> 1:00:00.541
Goodness.

1:00:01.500 --> 1:00:03.875
So, can we go
to the bank today after school?

1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:06.833
Certainly.

Beth, will you come down here, please?

1:01:14.375 --> 1:01:15.208
What's wrong?

1:01:15.958 --> 1:01:18.375
I've been leafing
through this chess magazine.

1:01:18.458 --> 1:01:19.916
It's very interesting.

1:01:20.750 --> 1:01:23.500
It says here that there is
a tournament in Cincinnati,

1:01:23.583 --> 1:01:25.916
and the first prize is 500 dollars.

1:01:28.625 --> 1:01:31.708
The Greyhound bus
only requires two hours for the trip.

1:01:32.666 --> 1:01:34.208
I took the liberty of calling.

1:01:37.541 --> 1:01:38.708
What about school?

1:01:39.625 --> 1:01:42.333
I could write a medical excuse
claiming mono.

1:01:42.416 --> 1:01:43.333
Mono?

1:01:43.416 --> 1:01:44.458
Mononucleosis.

1:01:44.541 --> 1:01:48.125
It's quite the thing in your age group,
according to the Ladies Home Journal.

1:01:51.541 --> 1:01:52.541
Where would we stay?

1:01:53.041 --> 1:01:56.666
At the Gibson Hotel, in a double room
for 22 dollars a night.

1:01:57.750 --> 1:02:01.041
The Greyhound tickets
would be $11.80 apiece,

1:02:01.583 --> 1:02:03.166
plus the cost of food.

1:02:03.250 --> 1:02:04.791
I've calculated all of it.

1:02:05.583 --> 1:02:08.125
Even if you only won
second or third prize,

1:02:08.833 --> 1:02:10.333
there would still be a profit.

1:02:11.875 --> 1:02:12.708
I'll win.

1:02:14.416 --> 1:02:16.375
I have every confidence.
