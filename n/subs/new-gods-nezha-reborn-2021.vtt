WEBVTT

00:52.083 --> 00:53.625
Ladies and gentlemen.

00:53.708 --> 00:56.583
Get ready and hold your breath.

00:57.166 --> 00:58.416
Here we go!

00:58.500 --> 01:00.500
Ride the wind!

01:01.708 --> 01:04.083
Some roads lead into the fire.

01:04.166 --> 01:06.250
Some roads lead into the sea.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.666
Some roads lead into the light.

01:08.750 --> 01:11.833
Some roads lead into a fight.

01:11.916 --> 01:14.083
Some roads lead into your heart.

01:14.166 --> 01:16.833
Some roads shake you.

01:16.916 --> 01:19.416
Some roads take you

01:20.333 --> 01:21.750
to the start.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.791
Everyone has an identity.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.541
In different times and places,

01:27.625 --> 01:29.958
we all play different roles.

01:30.041 --> 01:31.333
Are you crazy?

01:31.416 --> 01:33.541
A student, worker,

01:33.625 --> 01:35.750
father, daughter, and hero.

01:36.458 --> 01:38.041
You have good luck!

01:38.125 --> 01:39.375
My name's Li Yunxiang.

01:39.458 --> 01:41.291
Right now, I'm a motorcycle racer.

01:42.041 --> 01:44.625
The one who's about to win the race.

01:46.125 --> 01:47.541
Not yet, though.

01:48.375 --> 01:51.416
Each person finds their own place
Along the path

01:51.500 --> 01:54.458
I'm still not the rider
Who has won your heart yet

01:54.541 --> 01:56.208
My bike's roaring

01:56.291 --> 01:57.375
The wind's soaring

01:57.458 --> 02:00.375
Blow away all the numb indifference
In this troubled world

02:00.458 --> 02:02.000
God knows if I am

02:02.083 --> 02:03.458
How I should be yet

02:03.541 --> 02:04.500
I know I just

02:05.083 --> 02:06.875
Can't stand the way you look at me

02:06.958 --> 02:09.833
I risk my life finding myself
In chaos and speed

02:09.916 --> 02:13.041
Only if I give it my all will I succeed

02:27.000 --> 02:28.625
-That's amazing!
-That's amazing!

02:29.208 --> 02:31.416
The competition just now was so exciting!

02:32.958 --> 02:33.875
Hurry up!

02:33.958 --> 02:35.916
Let us congratulate Li Yunxiang

02:36.000 --> 02:40.125
for winning
the Underground Street Race again!

02:41.125 --> 02:42.166
Thank you.

02:42.250 --> 02:45.250
That was close,
but you managed to save yourself.

02:45.333 --> 02:48.041
Li Yunxiang,
your condition today is not bad.

02:48.125 --> 02:50.333
Show some respect.

02:50.416 --> 02:51.916
Don't you know who I am?

02:53.000 --> 02:56.500
I thought I was doomed. I have no idea
how the motorcycle flew across.

02:56.583 --> 02:58.125
You didn't know,

02:58.208 --> 02:59.875
but I was so anxious up there.

02:59.958 --> 03:01.541
I know you want to impress her,

03:01.625 --> 03:03.583
but there's no need to risk your life.

03:03.666 --> 03:06.541
She is a tough competition.
I had to pull out a wild card.

03:06.625 --> 03:08.375
Haven't you always liked her?

03:08.458 --> 03:11.458
-Go talk to her then. This is typical.
-Get off.

03:11.541 --> 03:12.708
What are you scared of?

03:13.375 --> 03:20.000
GASOLINE

03:26.041 --> 03:28.083
True, she is a bit older than me.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.708
Soon,

03:29.791 --> 03:32.291
you'll be calling her Aunt.

03:32.375 --> 03:33.375
Cut it out.

03:33.458 --> 03:35.333
You don't get it, silly girl.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.541
You choose love over friendship.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.041
I'm still standing here.

03:39.750 --> 03:40.750
We met again.

03:44.250 --> 03:46.125
That was extreme, right?

03:47.166 --> 03:48.500
Great work on the motorcycle.

03:50.083 --> 03:52.583
Hey, I still don't know your name.

03:55.708 --> 03:57.625
You are upsetting your girlfriend.

03:58.458 --> 04:00.333
-She is not--
-See you next time.

04:00.416 --> 04:03.125
Let's do this again soon!

04:04.333 --> 04:06.666
You are bad at flirting.

04:13.916 --> 04:17.708
Hey, kid, your motorcycle looks good.
Help me with mine someday.

04:19.416 --> 04:21.166
Why should I do that?

04:21.250 --> 04:23.750
You are going? I run this place!

04:23.833 --> 04:24.916
I live here!

04:25.000 --> 04:26.750
Come hang out when you are free.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.583
Make sure you modify my motorcycle!

04:31.625 --> 04:34.541
THE NEW ORDER OF THE GODS
AROSE FROM CHAOS.

04:34.625 --> 04:38.666
3,000 YEARS AGO,
HAVOC REIGNED AMONG GODS AND HUMANS.

04:38.750 --> 04:43.041
THE GODS FOUGHT FOR SUPREMACY.

04:43.125 --> 04:47.041
THE WORLD SETTLED
UNDER THE NEW CELESTIAL ORDER.

04:48.958 --> 04:51.750
ANOTHER ERA OF CHAOS
AND CONFLICT BEGAN.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.833
IN DONGHAI CITY,
AN UNEASY TRUCE REIGNED.

04:53.916 --> 04:56.375
DE, LI, SONG, AND SHUN,
FOUR CLANS RULED.

04:56.458 --> 04:58.541
AMONG THEM,
DE CLAN WAS THE MOST POWERFUL.

04:58.625 --> 05:01.125
IN RECENT YEARS,
DONGHAI HAD RUN OUT OF WATER.

05:01.208 --> 05:02.958
Water is gold.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.083
Donghai has affections.

05:05.166 --> 05:08.958
Donghai's De Group brings you water.

05:09.041 --> 05:10.750
-We believe that De Group…
-Extra!

05:10.833 --> 05:13.250
-Everyone must conserve water!
-…will create a better tomorrow.

05:13.333 --> 05:15.166
-Crackdown on smugglers!
-Only half a pail left?

05:15.250 --> 05:17.583
-Boss De invests widely in Donghai!
-Give me some.

05:17.666 --> 05:19.333
Newsboy, give me a copy!

05:20.583 --> 05:21.625
Your paper!

05:21.708 --> 05:23.541
Extra! The water shortage worsens!

05:23.625 --> 05:25.666
-Kid, give me a paper.
-Here.

05:27.250 --> 05:30.083
Thank you, boss!
Extra! The water shortage worsens!

05:30.166 --> 05:31.833
-The people are--
-Tiger.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.333
Tell me, is there any money
in water speculation?

05:34.416 --> 05:36.666
If I knew,
I wouldn't have to sell newspapers.

05:36.750 --> 05:37.958
Get lost.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.916
Crackdown on water smugglers!

05:41.916 --> 05:44.500
Be careful, kid. It's a new dress.

05:44.583 --> 05:46.541
Ms. San, you look so pretty.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.791
You might catch the boss's eye

05:48.875 --> 05:50.291
and go from crow to phoenix.

05:50.375 --> 05:52.375
You little shit, so I'm a crow?

05:52.458 --> 05:54.000
No, you are a phoenix.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.125
Thank you, Ms. San.

05:55.208 --> 05:58.458
-Extra! The water shortage worsens!
-Tiger, I'll take one.

05:58.541 --> 05:59.666
Here, catch!

06:01.291 --> 06:02.458
Here.

06:02.541 --> 06:03.708
Extra! Donghai…

06:03.791 --> 06:04.916
-Be careful!
-Mrs. Liu.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.583
-Mr. Cheng.
-Six.

06:08.666 --> 06:09.666
You are back early.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.666
Six!

06:16.208 --> 06:18.458
-Thank you, Six!
-Do you know how to kick?

06:20.916 --> 06:22.000
Six, good timing,

06:22.625 --> 06:23.916
take this too.

06:24.000 --> 06:24.958
Sure.

06:25.041 --> 06:25.916
SPEEDY COURIERS

06:26.000 --> 06:28.166
The four clans own this place.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.375
Everyone knows their word is the law.

06:30.458 --> 06:31.541
Imagine working for them.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.000
Easy money and status too.

06:33.083 --> 06:35.333
-Yunxiang, are you fixing it up?
-Not smuggling like us.

06:35.416 --> 06:37.583
-I'm just adding in some bits.
-Six, give me a hand.

06:37.666 --> 06:39.416
-I'm coming!
-Liang, I won't work for them.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.166
-To the warehouse.
-Once outlaws come clean,

06:41.250 --> 06:43.583
some die, and others run,
but it's always a bad ending.

06:43.666 --> 06:45.458
You have to be given that chance first.

06:45.541 --> 06:47.250
Have you seen those guys in the clans?

06:47.333 --> 06:48.708
You see a dragon's head

06:48.791 --> 06:50.458
and never see its tail.

06:50.541 --> 06:52.000
That's just sour grapes.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.416
Who would smuggle
if you could go the legal way?

06:54.500 --> 06:55.791
What are you talking about?

06:55.875 --> 06:57.583
We have nothing to do with the clans.

06:57.666 --> 06:59.250
-Boss.
-We smuggle

06:59.333 --> 07:01.625
-to survive in a waterless world.
-Yes.

07:01.708 --> 07:04.166
Being able to put food on the table

07:04.250 --> 07:05.416
is good enough.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.666
-Right?
-Sure.

07:07.750 --> 07:11.416
-That's if it is enough to survive.
-Come and get the goods.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.291
-Get the goods.
-Take it up to Song territory.

07:13.375 --> 07:14.375
Okay.

07:14.458 --> 07:15.375
For you two.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.166
Yunxiang, this is for you.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.208
It's risky lately. Stay calm.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.416
I'm off.

07:33.333 --> 07:35.750
I've never been to other cities,

07:36.541 --> 07:37.666
but I know

07:37.750 --> 07:40.166
all cities are the same.

07:41.291 --> 07:43.416
Just different people in different places.

07:44.000 --> 07:48.916
In some places, it's so green
like each leaf was soaked in water.

07:51.333 --> 07:52.958
But in other places…

07:53.875 --> 07:55.708
Water!

07:55.791 --> 07:56.833
Water!

07:58.416 --> 07:59.375
Come on, give me some.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.666
Spare me some money.

08:02.750 --> 08:03.791
That's it for today.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.291
-Go home.
-Sir.

08:05.375 --> 08:07.666
I have water coins.
Can't you give me a few drops?

08:07.750 --> 08:08.708
What did I say?

08:10.708 --> 08:11.875
Come back tomorrow.

08:13.291 --> 08:14.666
It shouldn't be like this.

08:16.041 --> 08:17.666
Yet it has always been this way.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.958
-However, it's the only world we have.
-It has always been this kind of world

08:25.875 --> 08:28.583
Same air

08:29.250 --> 08:31.708
Different fates

08:32.666 --> 08:35.458
Begin to feel

08:35.541 --> 08:40.416
Don't live in this kind of world

08:42.833 --> 08:45.208
DE WATER INDUSTRY

08:45.791 --> 08:48.333
Starting today

08:48.416 --> 08:54.083
We live in this kind of world

08:56.125 --> 08:57.166
NO ENTRY

08:57.250 --> 08:58.083
Over there!

09:04.125 --> 09:05.666
Be who you are

09:11.625 --> 09:13.625
-There's water!
-There's water!

09:21.125 --> 09:23.250
Yunxiang, how did it go yesterday?

09:23.333 --> 09:25.166
-They increased the patrols.
-We can't do this.

09:25.250 --> 09:27.666
It's getting tougher all the time.

09:27.750 --> 09:29.458
You want a decent living,

09:29.541 --> 09:31.041
but there are no easy jobs.

09:31.125 --> 09:33.250
-You have no choice.
-Where should I put this?

09:36.458 --> 09:37.291
There's a kitten!

09:39.500 --> 09:41.541
-A kitten?
-Six, where did it come from?

09:41.625 --> 09:44.166
I'm not sure about it,
but there's a delivery address.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.958
We should put a sign to tell people
we are a fake courier service.

09:48.041 --> 09:49.750
Contraband only. That's it.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.708
-Should we just throw it?
-Don't do that.

09:51.791 --> 09:52.708
I'll deliver it.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.458
Someone didn't want it,

10:02.541 --> 10:05.416
so they gave a fake address
and threw it our way.

10:06.125 --> 10:07.375
Handle it yourself.

10:10.375 --> 10:11.833
Fake address.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.583
Okay. You may go.

10:17.833 --> 10:19.958
See, you don't need an owner.

10:20.041 --> 10:22.708
There's no one bossing you around.
You are lucky!

10:28.250 --> 10:29.791
It's a big world.

10:29.875 --> 10:31.625
You'll be fine on your own.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.875
Go. Hurry up and leave.

10:57.583 --> 11:00.500
Sending a tiny cat,
like you, into the world

11:00.583 --> 11:02.291
is indeed crazy.

11:02.375 --> 11:08.875
PALACE OF HAPPINESS

11:15.250 --> 11:17.333
PALACE OF HAPPINESS, NIGHTCLUB

11:17.416 --> 11:18.416
Ms. San.

11:26.416 --> 11:28.875
Such a big world

11:28.958 --> 11:31.916
So many places

11:32.000 --> 11:34.583
A free spirit like me

11:34.666 --> 11:37.458
Could linger anywhere

11:37.958 --> 11:40.708
Such a big world

11:40.791 --> 11:43.500
So many young men

11:43.583 --> 11:46.291
A free spirit like me

11:46.375 --> 11:49.458
Could find love anywhere

11:49.541 --> 11:52.458
There's a place

11:52.541 --> 11:55.000
I cannot go

11:55.500 --> 11:58.375
There's a young man

11:58.458 --> 12:00.875
I can't even say hello to

12:01.458 --> 12:04.125
That place is home

12:04.208 --> 12:06.750
That man is you

12:07.416 --> 12:09.750
But young man

12:09.833 --> 12:13.083
What do you know?

12:13.166 --> 12:15.625
Life and death go on

12:16.208 --> 12:18.916
Flowers bloom and fade

12:19.000 --> 12:21.791
But young man

12:21.875 --> 12:24.125
Why are you hesitant?

12:24.916 --> 12:27.125
Flowers will bloom again

12:27.958 --> 12:30.125
Youth comes only once

12:38.833 --> 12:41.250
But young man

12:42.166 --> 12:44.666
Why are you hesitant?

12:46.000 --> 12:48.375
But young man

12:49.583 --> 12:52.875
What do you know?

13:00.875 --> 13:03.125
Yunxiang, what are you doing here?

13:03.208 --> 13:05.166
Why? Am I not allowed to come?

13:05.250 --> 13:06.541
Don't mess up my hair.

13:06.625 --> 13:08.375
Why is it a small crowd tonight?

13:08.458 --> 13:10.875
Someone sabotaged the sluice gates.

13:10.958 --> 13:13.041
They say that until he is found,

13:13.125 --> 13:14.916
there will be no more water. So--

13:15.916 --> 13:17.416
Is this for me?

13:18.375 --> 13:20.208
-Yes.
-It's such a cute kitten!

13:20.291 --> 13:22.958
What made you think of this?

13:23.791 --> 13:25.041
Are you delivering again?

13:27.916 --> 13:29.958
If Old Li finds out he will be pissed.

13:30.041 --> 13:32.708
Only I can call him "Old Li."

13:33.666 --> 13:34.708
Speaking of Old Li,

13:34.791 --> 13:36.500
let's have dinner there tonight.

13:36.583 --> 13:39.875
Last time, you had a fight
and said you wouldn't see him again.

13:40.916 --> 13:42.875
-You are using me as an excuse.
-Cut it out!

13:42.958 --> 13:44.791
-I'm driving.
-How will you thank me?

13:52.458 --> 13:53.625
This building will do.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.500
It's higher than
the second building by 20 stories.

13:57.583 --> 13:59.125
Won't the other three clans

13:59.208 --> 14:00.416
build a building too?

14:01.541 --> 14:04.083
They are too busy
fighting with each other.

14:04.166 --> 14:05.500
Their finances are a mess.

14:06.791 --> 14:09.000
Dad says to keep the people in line.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.958
You can't let them get too comfortable.

14:11.041 --> 14:13.333
Full bellies

14:13.416 --> 14:15.250
foster random thoughts.

14:16.041 --> 14:17.833
-Donghai lacks water.
-Let's go.

14:17.916 --> 14:20.208
-From lack comes the need.
-Okay.

14:20.291 --> 14:22.125
Grasp what they need,

14:22.208 --> 14:23.833
and you will rule over them.

14:24.791 --> 14:27.541
-Your dad knows human nature.
-Okay.

14:27.625 --> 14:29.250
Controlling the water

14:29.333 --> 14:31.583
-means controlling Donghai.
-Follow us.

14:40.750 --> 14:41.958
Nice motorcycle.

14:44.916 --> 14:46.125
Nice car.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.333
He's the third son
of the De Group's owner.

14:49.125 --> 14:50.083
Really?

14:56.875 --> 14:58.416
Sell him the motorcycle.

14:58.500 --> 15:00.458
State your price,
our master will give it to you.

15:09.666 --> 15:11.708
Old Li, it's us!

15:13.208 --> 15:14.166
I'm back.

15:15.500 --> 15:18.208
Kasha, you haven't visited in ages.

15:18.291 --> 15:21.041
-Well, I'm here now.
-Look at you, calling him "Old Li."

15:21.125 --> 15:23.208
Jinxiang, are you the cook tonight?

15:24.083 --> 15:26.375
Forget it. You boys have a good chat.

15:26.458 --> 15:27.500
I'll cook.

15:28.916 --> 15:30.416
Jinxiang, why are you here today?

15:30.500 --> 15:32.500
Anti-Smuggling Bureau
busted another smuggling ring.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.125
I had to deliver the report.

15:34.208 --> 15:35.500
The place was close by.

15:36.166 --> 15:37.333
How have you been?

15:37.416 --> 15:39.291
Is your courier job still going well?

15:39.375 --> 15:41.666
-It's still the same.
-Hand me a Number 5 wrench.

15:41.750 --> 15:42.583
Okay.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.583
Yesterday someone broke
the sluice gates of the city.

15:51.666 --> 15:54.750
Distribution has been halted

15:54.833 --> 15:57.125
while authorities investigate.

15:57.208 --> 15:58.666
Enough with the bad news.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.041
The bastard is causing trouble
for all of us.

16:02.125 --> 16:03.541
If I find him,

16:03.625 --> 16:05.208
I will break his legs.

16:06.916 --> 16:08.458
You can pour yours, Yunxiang.

16:08.541 --> 16:10.541
Dad, a toast to you.

16:14.666 --> 16:16.708
Amidst the chaos and taxes,

16:16.791 --> 16:19.791
we are not rich, but not poor either.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.041
In any case,

16:21.125 --> 16:24.041
it's better to have a proper job.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.208
-Here is the soup!
-All right.

16:35.291 --> 16:36.375
Here, Dad.

16:36.958 --> 16:38.125
Have some soup.

16:38.916 --> 16:41.708
The bureau still has water
so I brought you two buckets.

16:41.791 --> 16:43.750
Otherwise, there'd be
no dinner tonight.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.875
The soup is delicious.

16:46.958 --> 16:50.250
Our area is under De Clan.
We are in the best shape economically.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.541
Elsewhere, it's chaos.

16:52.625 --> 16:55.208
People are living precariously.

16:55.291 --> 16:58.541
The De Clan is tough but meticulous.

16:58.625 --> 16:59.708
Life isn't easy,

16:59.791 --> 17:02.250
but we make ends meet.

17:05.208 --> 17:07.875
I'm not worried about you.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.833
Shady business never ends well.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.375
I've had enough.

17:41.791 --> 17:43.708
Old Li is just worried about you.

17:44.708 --> 17:45.750
Worried, my ass.

17:49.458 --> 17:50.875
Cats have better lives.

17:50.958 --> 17:53.208
They have no one to nag them.

17:53.833 --> 17:55.833
You can live your own life.

17:55.916 --> 17:56.791
Come on.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.291
You have a dad and a brother.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.416
I wish my folks were still alive

18:01.500 --> 18:03.125
to nag me every day.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.208
I won't mind if they scold me either.

18:06.291 --> 18:07.208
Kasha is right.

18:07.291 --> 18:09.750
You know what Dad is like.

18:11.208 --> 18:12.666
The De Clan sent down orders

18:12.750 --> 18:14.500
to clamp down hard on smuggling.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.625
Be careful with the stuff you do.

18:17.750 --> 18:19.208
You know that our bureau

18:19.291 --> 18:21.208
practically works for them.

18:22.083 --> 18:23.000
I'm off.

18:23.083 --> 18:24.250
It can't last.

18:24.833 --> 18:27.541
-Get out while you can.
-Goodbye, Jinxiang!

18:36.166 --> 18:37.833
Someone is following us.

19:04.541 --> 19:05.750
I like

19:05.833 --> 19:06.916
this motorcycle.

19:08.041 --> 19:09.583
I like it too.

19:11.416 --> 19:14.250
Whatever it is that I like, I will get.

19:15.541 --> 19:16.833
Not this time.

19:17.500 --> 19:18.750
I'm not giving it to you.

19:28.916 --> 19:29.916
Hold on tight.

21:13.666 --> 21:14.833
Kasha--

21:15.791 --> 21:16.958
Try and run now.

21:19.708 --> 21:22.166
Do you think what's yours is yours?

21:23.208 --> 21:25.875
As long as I want it,

21:25.958 --> 21:27.625
it is mine.

21:29.541 --> 21:30.625
Third Prince.

22:21.375 --> 22:22.958
-Master.
-Let's go.

22:54.750 --> 22:55.916
Yes, Boss.

22:56.916 --> 22:58.500
I think it's him.

23:00.416 --> 23:01.666
I know.

23:02.833 --> 23:04.708
It has been so many years.

23:13.875 --> 23:14.791
Yes,

23:15.833 --> 23:17.666
a wall of red flame.

23:23.291 --> 23:25.458
If it's really him,

23:25.541 --> 23:26.833
it's your son

23:27.333 --> 23:29.083
who provoked him again.

23:32.833 --> 23:34.583
Nurse, this medicine is spilled.

23:34.666 --> 23:36.375
I'll change it for you right away.

23:40.125 --> 23:42.750
-That patient is improving.
-Keep him under observation.

23:42.833 --> 23:45.291
-Doctor, his fever is gone.
-Monitor him. I'll see him later.

23:45.375 --> 23:46.750
Dr. Su, please sign here.

23:46.833 --> 23:48.958
-Water's short. Use it sparingly.
-Okay.

23:49.041 --> 23:50.708
Come, I'll give you an injection.

23:54.250 --> 23:55.125
It's you.

23:55.750 --> 23:56.875
Why are you--

23:57.625 --> 24:00.041
I'm Su Junzhu, a doctor here.

24:00.541 --> 24:01.583
How did I get here?

24:01.666 --> 24:03.833
A masked man brought you in last night.

24:03.916 --> 24:05.000
I was on duty.

24:05.750 --> 24:08.416
Don't move. You are badly injured--

24:08.500 --> 24:10.000
How did it heal so quickly?

24:11.541 --> 24:12.791
What is it?

24:27.250 --> 24:28.250
Kasha!

24:28.333 --> 24:29.500
Where is she?

24:56.166 --> 24:59.291
When she arrived,
it was already too late to save her leg.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.291
She is still not out of danger.

25:07.583 --> 25:08.416
CIJI HOSPITAL

25:12.125 --> 25:13.750
DE GROUP

25:15.625 --> 25:16.583
DONGHAI AUDIT

25:16.666 --> 25:18.166
Why are you outside?

25:18.750 --> 25:20.916
-You look okay.
-I am okay.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.458
How's Kasha?

25:22.541 --> 25:23.666
Kasha…

25:30.833 --> 25:32.000
The De Clan?

26:11.958 --> 26:13.333
Hey, that's…

26:13.416 --> 26:14.958
That's Boss De.

26:20.208 --> 26:23.458
I apologize on behalf of my son.

26:23.541 --> 26:25.833
Young men can be wild.

26:25.916 --> 26:27.416
He has done wrong against you.

26:27.500 --> 26:29.458
Please forgive him.

26:29.541 --> 26:30.875
He has offended you.

26:31.666 --> 26:34.541
We respectfully return your motorcycle.

26:36.458 --> 26:38.666
Here's a small token of respect.

26:38.750 --> 26:40.833
Kindly accept this gesture

26:40.916 --> 26:42.583
and let us move on.

26:42.666 --> 26:43.875
Boss De,

26:43.958 --> 26:45.750
this is so--

26:51.666 --> 26:52.541
You--

26:52.625 --> 26:54.291
If you want to apologize,

26:54.375 --> 26:55.708
give me your son's leg.

26:59.875 --> 27:01.666
Boss De, I'm so sorry.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.833
My little brother has a bad temper.

27:03.916 --> 27:05.958
I'll try and talk to him.

27:15.291 --> 27:16.291
Boss,

27:16.375 --> 27:17.875
is it really him?

27:17.958 --> 27:21.666
It might just be someone
with a superpower,

27:21.750 --> 27:23.875
but it might also be him.

27:23.958 --> 27:26.875
In every reincarnation,
it's the same story.

27:26.958 --> 27:28.208
But why?

27:29.208 --> 27:30.958
It's the Will of Heaven.

27:31.041 --> 27:32.833
You can't fight it.

27:33.791 --> 27:36.958
It must play out, cycle after cycle.

27:37.541 --> 27:39.583
Before he is fully awakened,

27:39.666 --> 27:41.333
let's get rid of him.

27:42.125 --> 27:44.291
Just like the last few times.

27:44.375 --> 27:46.041
The plan is in place.

27:46.125 --> 27:47.958
They are onto him.

27:51.833 --> 27:54.916
Don't be like that.
Boss De is such a big man to be so polite.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.541
Do you know what happened to Kasha's leg?

28:00.500 --> 28:01.666
Yes, I know.

28:01.750 --> 28:03.125
The doctor phoned me.

28:03.208 --> 28:05.500
All that gold
could buy her the best treatment

28:05.583 --> 28:07.250
and she will be set for life.

28:07.333 --> 28:09.041
What can people like us do?

28:09.125 --> 28:11.250
Donghai City is like that.
Why can't you accept reality?

28:11.333 --> 28:12.625
It's because I can't!

28:13.208 --> 28:15.458
It's up to you to accept
but think of Kasha.

28:15.541 --> 28:16.875
What about her future?

28:16.958 --> 28:18.208
Also, it's all because--

28:45.500 --> 28:47.625
-Jinxiang, hop on!
-Okay!

28:58.041 --> 28:59.416
Jinxiang, quick!

29:14.666 --> 29:15.708
CLIFF! DANGER!

29:15.791 --> 29:17.083
The cliff!

29:38.916 --> 29:40.875
-Who are these monsters?
-Move!

30:23.000 --> 30:24.166
Do it.

31:09.583 --> 31:10.625
Down!

31:24.125 --> 31:27.500
I love the smell of grilled fish
in the morning.

31:28.666 --> 31:30.291
Who are they? Who are you?

31:30.375 --> 31:32.166
Nezha, you are--

31:33.083 --> 31:34.000
a scatterbrain.

31:34.583 --> 31:35.916
What did you call me?

31:37.083 --> 31:40.083
We know each other, Nezha.

31:43.250 --> 31:45.208
Me calling him "Nezha"

31:45.291 --> 31:46.625
makes you excited, right?

31:46.708 --> 31:47.958
It must have shocked him.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.000
See you later!

31:54.541 --> 31:56.291
Doctor! Dr. Su!

31:56.375 --> 31:57.250
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

31:57.333 --> 31:58.333
Take him to surgery!

32:00.041 --> 32:01.583
Move!

32:01.666 --> 32:03.208
Who are these monsters?

32:06.333 --> 32:08.833
-Who are you?
-I live here, Nezha.

32:28.875 --> 32:30.458
Our total defeat

32:30.541 --> 32:32.125
doesn't surprise me.

32:32.833 --> 32:35.833
Dad, even if he has special powers,

32:35.916 --> 32:37.125
I started this,

32:37.208 --> 32:38.666
so I should finish it.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.083
You will, will you?

33:17.416 --> 33:19.208
Dad, he hurt you too?

33:20.333 --> 33:22.750
Yes, he did.

33:23.541 --> 33:26.708
Me, the Dragon King of East Sea.

33:29.666 --> 33:31.916
It has been 3,000 years

33:32.000 --> 33:34.000
and it's still not healed.

33:44.416 --> 33:46.541
He is crazy.

33:47.208 --> 33:50.375
Full of magical powers and violence.

33:50.458 --> 33:53.041
He would kill both god and demon.

33:53.125 --> 33:55.708
Gender and relations won't matter.

33:56.291 --> 33:59.708
He would even kill his own dad.

34:02.250 --> 34:03.125
He is

34:03.958 --> 34:05.333
Nezha.

34:41.791 --> 34:42.958
You came.

34:43.041 --> 34:44.750
Why do you call me Nezha?

34:44.833 --> 34:46.625
Because that's who you are.

34:46.708 --> 34:47.583
Let me ask you.

34:47.666 --> 34:51.458
When you were a kid, did your dad ever
tell the story of Nezha and Dragon King?

34:51.541 --> 34:52.791
Of course I know the story.

34:52.875 --> 34:54.291
Well, you are that

34:54.375 --> 34:55.375
chaos-creating,

34:55.458 --> 34:56.583
sea-churning,

34:56.666 --> 34:58.958
insufferably arrogant Nezha!

34:59.958 --> 35:01.458
You are Nezha!

35:09.541 --> 35:12.458
A bachelor has to do everything himself.

35:12.541 --> 35:13.833
What was I saying?

35:13.916 --> 35:15.666
-That I'm Nezha.
-Right.

35:15.750 --> 35:16.791
Each reincarnation

35:16.875 --> 35:18.625
means a new name and identity,

35:18.708 --> 35:20.041
parents, family, friends,

35:20.125 --> 35:24.625
and all the normal mess of life.

35:24.708 --> 35:25.958
Do you have a girlfriend?

35:26.041 --> 35:28.000
Do you?

35:29.916 --> 35:31.750
Boss De is the Dragon King of East Sea.

35:31.833 --> 35:35.250
His son, that little bastard is
the Dragon King's Third Prince, Ao Bing.

35:36.833 --> 35:39.125
So in past lives, he killed me.

35:39.208 --> 35:42.583
Your dad used all his powers

35:42.666 --> 35:45.916
to forge you a steel dragon spine

35:46.000 --> 35:48.375
and bring you back to life.

35:49.333 --> 35:51.291
But the injury

35:51.375 --> 35:53.458
wiped your memory of past lives.

35:56.083 --> 35:57.916
Three thousand years ago,

35:58.000 --> 36:02.333
the four Dragon Kings
stopped fighting each other

36:03.333 --> 36:06.833
so that united, we could make him
kill himself in the atonement.

36:07.750 --> 36:09.666
Who knew that after his death,

36:09.750 --> 36:11.708
his soul evaded Heaven's dragnet

36:12.541 --> 36:15.125
and reincarnated again and again.

36:15.208 --> 36:18.125
The one beside Li Jing in Heaven

36:18.208 --> 36:21.208
is just a clay effigy, a fake Nezha.

36:21.291 --> 36:22.750
The real Nezha

36:22.833 --> 36:24.083
has escaped.

36:24.875 --> 36:26.500
So for 3,000 years,

36:26.583 --> 36:28.625
we have kept an eye on Donghai.

36:28.708 --> 36:31.416
Anyone who appears
to be his reincarnation,

36:31.500 --> 36:34.125
we will kill him.

36:34.208 --> 36:37.458
It's better to kill in error
than take chances.

36:40.625 --> 36:42.750
My luck is good today.
Let's drink this one.

36:46.583 --> 36:48.916
The flames from my body

36:49.000 --> 36:52.000
and that huge shadowy figure behind me.

36:52.083 --> 36:53.500
They're all…

36:53.583 --> 36:55.250
That's his original god-body.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.458
You are Nezha reborn, my dear brother!

36:59.291 --> 37:00.791
Cut it out. Come drink.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.250
Nezha was born with that fire

37:05.333 --> 37:06.583
hardcore, tough as steel.

37:07.166 --> 37:08.500
But once released…

37:08.583 --> 37:09.541
My goodness.

37:09.625 --> 37:11.666
Not even you can control it.

37:15.000 --> 37:15.875
See?

37:16.750 --> 37:18.833
That fire of his scares even me.

37:18.916 --> 37:21.291
If I'm Nezha, who are you then?

37:21.375 --> 37:22.458
Me?

37:23.125 --> 37:26.666
I'm not going to tell you.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.541
This time his awakening is more powerful.

37:33.250 --> 37:34.708
Don't provoke him.

37:35.583 --> 37:37.166
If I don't take revenge,

37:37.250 --> 37:39.000
I'm not Dragon King's Third Prince!

37:42.833 --> 37:44.041
Shut up.

38:02.625 --> 38:03.625
Leave.

38:03.708 --> 38:04.666
I--

38:11.583 --> 38:14.708
My Dragon Pearl is still powering up.

38:14.791 --> 38:16.333
It's not time yet.

38:17.083 --> 38:19.416
I'll hire someone

38:19.500 --> 38:21.166
to take him out.

38:23.541 --> 38:25.333
The pillars of the Heavens

38:25.833 --> 38:27.666
are collapsing.

38:28.916 --> 38:34.083
-The world is falling apart.
-"My god-body"? "Uncontrollable"?

38:34.166 --> 38:35.125
Who is he kidding?

39:01.666 --> 39:03.000
You want someone killed?

39:04.125 --> 39:05.416
Old pal,

39:05.500 --> 39:08.583
you have worked for me before.

39:08.666 --> 39:10.375
Don't act so surprised.

39:12.750 --> 39:15.125
This fish looks familiar.

39:15.208 --> 39:17.458
It's cooked now. Have some.

39:17.541 --> 39:19.458
You were there.

39:19.541 --> 39:21.916
Sure, I was passing by.

39:22.000 --> 39:23.166
He is just a kid.

39:23.250 --> 39:26.041
What's the big deal?

39:26.125 --> 39:29.583
Besides, you have plenty of men

39:29.666 --> 39:31.125
and I'm expensive.

39:35.083 --> 39:36.375
He is Nezha.

39:39.458 --> 39:40.791
Ao Guang.

39:41.750 --> 39:44.333
You really have a problem.

39:47.416 --> 39:49.833
You couldn't tell he was Nezha?

39:50.416 --> 39:54.333
There are others who use fire too.
For example, the Fire Imp.

39:55.541 --> 39:58.333
But if it's really that killer, Nezha,

39:58.416 --> 40:00.708
I'm no match for him.

40:02.708 --> 40:06.041
You concealed your identity and powers.

40:06.666 --> 40:10.166
You have plenty of tricks up your sleeve.

40:10.250 --> 40:12.666
Yaksa, you know a lot of things.

40:13.208 --> 40:14.833
But if you know so much,

40:14.916 --> 40:18.041
why do you always get beaten up?

40:18.916 --> 40:20.708
We all have our roles.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.083
Mine is to get beaten up,

40:23.166 --> 40:24.791
yours is to hide.

40:25.416 --> 40:26.416
Still,

40:26.500 --> 40:28.916
if your enemy comes knocking,

40:29.000 --> 40:31.291
you can turn yourself into a rat,

40:31.375 --> 40:33.083
but they will still find you.

40:33.166 --> 40:34.708
A rat…

40:35.708 --> 40:36.625
Good idea!

40:37.375 --> 40:38.875
A rat!

40:40.208 --> 40:41.625
You know,

40:41.708 --> 40:44.875
the old Order of the Gods is meaningless.

40:45.541 --> 40:49.083
A new one will arise sooner or later.

40:49.958 --> 40:52.333
Then, the Chan and Jie factions

40:52.416 --> 40:56.333
will battle to death once again.

40:57.041 --> 40:59.375
No one gets to keep their hands clean.

41:00.041 --> 41:02.833
Where will you hide then?

41:04.208 --> 41:05.708
Help me now

41:05.791 --> 41:08.833
and we will look after you then.

41:11.625 --> 41:13.708
Goodbye, old pal.

41:19.791 --> 41:21.125
Will he do it?

41:21.916 --> 41:25.875
He always agrees if the price is right.

41:27.083 --> 41:29.125
These demons

41:29.208 --> 41:31.875
are only after profits.

41:32.583 --> 41:34.083
Be patient.

41:38.416 --> 41:39.708
Don't worry. He is in here.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.958
-I--
-Get out.

42:30.708 --> 42:31.833
-Father--
-Admit you're wrong!

42:31.916 --> 42:33.625
-It's not my fault!
-You are a bad seed!

42:38.500 --> 42:39.375
Fire!

42:40.500 --> 42:42.583
-Fire!
-Bring the fire extinguisher!

42:42.666 --> 42:43.541
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

42:43.625 --> 42:45.458
Call for help to put out the fire!

42:46.708 --> 42:48.375
Dr. Su, there's a fire down here.

42:48.875 --> 42:49.958
Over there!

43:03.833 --> 43:04.750
Hey!

43:05.708 --> 43:08.000
Will you be my teacher?

43:12.708 --> 43:13.833
Hey!

43:15.833 --> 43:17.291
No.

43:22.166 --> 43:24.583
Don't you want me
to modify a motorcycle for you?

43:25.666 --> 43:27.041
I'll help you.

43:28.041 --> 43:30.625
Just teach me how to control the fire.

43:32.208 --> 43:33.916
A motorcycle cooler than yours?

43:35.916 --> 43:37.083
It's not a problem.

43:39.208 --> 43:42.291
Okay, but you might not
be able to learn it.

43:42.375 --> 43:43.500
I'm telling you now.

43:43.583 --> 43:46.333
Either way,
you have to modify my motorcycle.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.166
Let me try.

43:48.750 --> 43:49.708
Let's go.

43:53.125 --> 43:54.208
You were born

43:54.291 --> 43:55.958
with an internal god-fire.

43:57.708 --> 43:59.750
But you are just flesh and blood now.

43:59.833 --> 44:02.000
The fire is too fierce.

44:02.083 --> 44:04.041
So you need some iron

44:04.125 --> 44:05.583
to channel it outwards.

44:07.125 --> 44:08.041
Put out the fire.

44:08.666 --> 44:10.541
What will happen if I don't?

44:10.625 --> 44:11.875
If you don't--

44:12.583 --> 44:14.041
It will burn the heart

44:14.125 --> 44:15.666
and split the skin.

44:15.750 --> 44:19.083
Your body dies and your spirit flies away.

44:22.625 --> 44:25.458
So you need a suit of armor

44:25.541 --> 44:27.916
to direct your internal fire.

44:32.041 --> 44:34.666
Once you master True Fire,

44:34.750 --> 44:37.458
you can survive in both sea and air.

44:37.541 --> 44:39.000
Are you sure about this?

45:08.666 --> 45:10.958
You have to maintain your focus.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.958
Don't let the fire control you.

45:24.583 --> 45:25.625
I'm sorry.

45:46.166 --> 45:47.083
What?

45:47.166 --> 45:48.333
Keep going!

46:24.083 --> 46:25.125
Come on.

46:27.250 --> 46:33.208
YUN

47:44.041 --> 47:45.208
That was fun!

47:46.583 --> 47:47.625
That was fun!

47:52.166 --> 47:53.250
Who are you really?

47:54.875 --> 47:56.000
I am

47:56.875 --> 47:58.291
Six-Ears Macaque.

48:00.041 --> 48:01.500
Six-Ears Macaque?

48:01.583 --> 48:03.708
In the legends, he tricks people.

48:03.791 --> 48:05.000
He is not a good person.

48:06.500 --> 48:08.708
How are you qualified to say that to me?

48:08.791 --> 48:11.541
How much harm have you caused?

48:11.625 --> 48:12.666
How many disasters?

48:12.750 --> 48:14.250
How many deaths?

48:14.333 --> 48:16.916
How many of your friends
and family got hurt?

48:17.000 --> 48:19.208
You are the bad one, Nezha.

48:19.291 --> 48:20.958
Who are you talking about?

48:29.958 --> 48:32.000
It has been a long time, Nezha.

48:36.625 --> 48:39.708
You still have a lousy temper.

48:50.916 --> 48:52.291
Why can't I get him back?

48:52.791 --> 48:56.166
You're not yet united
with Nezha's god-body.

48:57.750 --> 49:00.291
So naturally, you can't just call him up.

49:00.375 --> 49:01.750
"United"?

49:03.208 --> 49:04.083
Listen.

49:04.166 --> 49:07.000
Nezha was reborn as you, Li Yunxiang.

49:07.083 --> 49:09.875
But he has been reborn many times

49:09.958 --> 49:11.958
and will be back many more times.

49:12.041 --> 49:13.958
Zhang Yunxiang, Zhao Yunxiang,

49:14.041 --> 49:15.708
Wang Yunxiang, Sun Yunxiang…

49:15.791 --> 49:17.666
But until now,

49:17.750 --> 49:19.625
there has been no reincarnation

49:19.708 --> 49:21.750
that's worthy of his name.

49:21.833 --> 49:25.166
Some of them
didn't even realize they were Nezha

49:25.250 --> 49:26.708
as their life went past.

49:26.791 --> 49:29.000
They weren't up to it
and weren't Nezha enough.

49:30.166 --> 49:31.375
Also,

49:31.458 --> 49:35.166
if you want Nezha's full powers
you have to get back your Astras.

49:35.250 --> 49:36.333
Astras?

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
What Astras?

49:38.083 --> 49:41.250
Jinxiang. It's the Sky Ribbon
and Cosmic Ring.

49:42.750 --> 49:44.166
This armor

49:44.250 --> 49:45.958
is a bit slapdash.

49:46.041 --> 49:47.083
Keep at it.

49:47.166 --> 49:52.708
SPEEDY COURIERS

49:56.500 --> 49:59.208
Your dad has arranged everything.

49:59.291 --> 50:01.208
He is a clever strategist.

50:01.291 --> 50:03.916
We don't move until the time is ripe

50:04.000 --> 50:05.833
so that there are no slip-ups.

50:05.916 --> 50:08.666
We will take whatever help we can get.

50:09.791 --> 50:13.375
I want my revenge now.

50:14.166 --> 50:17.041
Third Prince, if we need to attack,

50:17.125 --> 50:18.458
leave it to me.

50:19.125 --> 50:21.791
After all, one of the Nezhas

50:21.875 --> 50:23.750
was killed by my hands.

50:25.666 --> 50:28.083
Yunxiang, that's so cool.

50:29.291 --> 50:30.625
-Let me see.
-What a poser.

50:30.708 --> 50:31.625
Li Yunxiang.

50:32.833 --> 50:34.375
Dr. Su, what brings you here?

50:34.958 --> 50:37.625
I've come to tell you
your brother's on the mend.

50:37.708 --> 50:40.416
-You should visit him.
-That's great! Thank you.

50:40.916 --> 50:42.041
I'll leave now.

50:42.125 --> 50:43.208
By the way,

50:43.291 --> 50:45.958
could you fix up my motorcycle one day?

50:46.708 --> 50:48.625
I'll never win against you then.

50:49.916 --> 50:51.125
Is that so important?

50:53.291 --> 50:54.541
-I can't tell.
-Exactly.

50:55.250 --> 50:56.916
-Who is she?
-Watch out!

51:20.041 --> 51:21.166
Yunxiang!

51:29.458 --> 51:30.458
Six!

51:31.291 --> 51:32.333
Bastard.

51:42.500 --> 51:45.500
It's just a pile of scrap iron.

51:52.625 --> 51:54.208
Scrap iron or not,

51:54.291 --> 51:55.375
I'll kill you!

52:53.583 --> 52:54.583
Li Yunxiang!

53:02.458 --> 53:03.583
Get lost!

53:13.125 --> 53:14.833
So, Third Prince,

53:14.916 --> 53:16.666
I wanted to see you.

53:17.583 --> 53:19.291
I was once young and naive.

53:19.375 --> 53:21.375
I thought if I worked hard at smuggling,

53:21.458 --> 53:23.833
I would make something of myself.

53:25.000 --> 53:26.625
I was duped.

53:27.708 --> 53:28.916
-Duped?
-Well,

53:29.000 --> 53:31.833
who knew that brat Li Yunxiang
was hiding so much?

53:31.916 --> 53:33.416
It turns out he is a big shot.

53:35.166 --> 53:37.708
He is a hero. But what about me?

53:38.583 --> 53:39.958
My business was ruined.

53:43.416 --> 53:44.583
The real thing.

53:49.666 --> 53:52.375
You know what you need to do, right?

53:52.458 --> 53:55.958
Third Prince, I'm smart and diligent.

53:56.041 --> 53:57.833
All I lacked was starting capital.

53:57.916 --> 54:00.041
If my dad was rich,

54:00.125 --> 54:01.416
I would be like you.

54:02.208 --> 54:03.583
I have money,

54:03.666 --> 54:05.041
but what's your life worth?

54:06.708 --> 54:08.666
Being a traitor doesn't worry you?

54:10.375 --> 54:12.000
What's a traitor who succeeds?

54:12.083 --> 54:14.333
A successful man.

54:17.708 --> 54:19.041
You can just wait and see.

54:19.666 --> 54:21.458
That thing that appears behind him,

54:21.541 --> 54:23.208
maybe I have one too.

54:50.208 --> 54:52.041
Your dad's with your brother.

54:52.125 --> 54:54.500
You should go and see him.
I'll keep watch here.

55:02.791 --> 55:05.500
There were so many wars then.

55:06.250 --> 55:07.916
We were fleeing from them…

55:09.916 --> 55:11.541
when your mom got sick

55:11.625 --> 55:13.625
and died.

55:14.416 --> 55:16.125
I had a shoulder pole

55:16.791 --> 55:19.083
with you in the front basket

55:19.166 --> 55:22.041
and your younger brother in the other.

55:23.166 --> 55:25.583
The night was dark, the hill was steep,

55:26.083 --> 55:27.500
and the baskets were heavy.

55:29.291 --> 55:31.666
I tripped and rolled down the hill.

55:32.166 --> 55:34.208
I was so scared.

55:34.291 --> 55:37.291
I scrambled back to the baskets

55:37.375 --> 55:39.041
and saw

55:39.125 --> 55:41.500
your brother laughing

55:41.583 --> 55:43.500
with such joy.

55:44.791 --> 55:46.791
He thought it was fun.

55:53.333 --> 55:55.833
The years have passed

55:56.916 --> 55:58.291
so quickly.

56:01.750 --> 56:04.500
Your brother was always causing trouble.

56:05.416 --> 56:08.041
I thought that when he grew up,

56:08.125 --> 56:11.291
he would be more sensible.

56:11.375 --> 56:14.625
I didn't expect him
to cause bigger troubles.

56:16.625 --> 56:18.291
Now you too…

56:36.500 --> 56:38.333
Your friends are all out of danger.

56:39.000 --> 56:40.125
You can relax.

56:47.541 --> 56:49.458
I have always wanted to be a doctor.

56:50.166 --> 56:52.000
Because I thought

56:52.083 --> 56:54.041
I could help a lot of people that way.

56:56.250 --> 56:57.666
I thought I could do that.

57:01.333 --> 57:02.625
Later, I realized

57:03.666 --> 57:06.208
a doctor can't help everyone.

57:07.375 --> 57:09.833
However, you can.

57:09.916 --> 57:10.875
Me?

57:13.125 --> 57:14.916
I bring nothing but trouble.

57:19.166 --> 57:20.625
Don't blame yourself.

57:21.541 --> 57:23.333
It wasn't you who hurt them.

57:26.666 --> 57:28.458
But it was because of me.

57:29.958 --> 57:30.875
You know,

57:32.166 --> 57:33.916
the first time I saw you,

57:34.000 --> 57:35.750
I knew you were different.

57:39.250 --> 57:40.375
Cheer up.

57:41.833 --> 57:43.166
What I saw just now

57:43.250 --> 57:45.083
was a hero with a body of flame

57:45.166 --> 57:46.916
and boundless powers.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.458
-Kasha!
-Kasha.

57:52.541 --> 57:55.666
-You need to be careful.
-I'm fine, I want to walk by myself.

58:48.125 --> 58:49.041
You…

58:49.125 --> 58:50.541
What are you doing?

58:50.625 --> 58:51.750
Six.

58:51.833 --> 58:53.000
Keep quiet.

58:53.083 --> 58:55.708
-You'll wake people up.
-Let me go!

58:56.166 --> 58:57.041
Who's that?

59:14.541 --> 59:15.541
Help!

59:16.666 --> 59:17.708
There's a murderer!

59:19.583 --> 59:20.666
Help!

1:00:04.458 --> 1:00:06.208
Come on! This way! Come!

1:00:53.416 --> 1:00:54.625
Kid!

1:00:55.791 --> 1:00:59.125
Stop it!

1:01:09.416 --> 1:01:10.500
Help!

1:01:10.583 --> 1:01:12.625
-Run!
-Help!

1:02:17.916 --> 1:02:20.000
Pay your blood debt with your life,

1:02:20.083 --> 1:02:20.916
Nezha.

1:02:46.791 --> 1:02:47.875
There's someone here.

1:02:48.375 --> 1:02:50.125
-Bear with it.
-Let's go over there.

1:02:50.208 --> 1:02:51.458
-Bear with it.
-I can't.

1:02:51.541 --> 1:02:53.250
-Don't move.
-Your wound will tear.

1:02:53.333 --> 1:02:54.708
Li Yunxiang, hurry!

1:02:54.791 --> 1:02:55.666
Your dad, he…

1:03:06.083 --> 1:03:07.083
Old Li!

1:03:07.875 --> 1:03:08.791
Old Li!

1:03:09.666 --> 1:03:10.666
Doctor.

1:03:10.750 --> 1:03:12.541
Doctor, hurry up and save him!

1:03:12.625 --> 1:03:13.833
Hurry up and save him!

1:03:15.875 --> 1:03:17.083
Aren't you a doctor?

1:03:20.875 --> 1:03:22.458
Why can't you save him?

1:03:23.541 --> 1:03:24.791
Why?

1:03:26.958 --> 1:03:27.916
Yunxiang.

1:03:31.208 --> 1:03:34.958
Whatever trouble
you get into in the future,

1:03:36.291 --> 1:03:39.416
I won't nag you over it anymore.

1:03:39.500 --> 1:03:41.625
Don't worry, we are in the hospital.

1:03:42.375 --> 1:03:43.625
You'll be okay.

1:03:44.416 --> 1:03:45.833
I always knew

1:03:47.375 --> 1:03:49.250
I had

1:03:50.416 --> 1:03:52.375
an amazing son.

1:03:53.583 --> 1:03:54.708
Stop talking,

1:03:55.541 --> 1:03:57.041
it will be okay.

1:03:57.125 --> 1:03:58.291
You,

1:03:58.958 --> 1:04:01.041
together with your friends,

1:04:02.333 --> 1:04:03.500
your brother,

1:04:05.541 --> 1:04:06.958
and yourself…

1:04:09.666 --> 1:04:10.708
Don't talk.

1:04:11.250 --> 1:04:13.541
Old Li, don't talk.

1:04:13.625 --> 1:04:15.458
Keep living well,

1:04:16.208 --> 1:04:18.833
for everyone's sake.

1:04:19.666 --> 1:04:20.875
Live…

1:04:32.083 --> 1:04:33.583
Dad!

1:04:36.083 --> 1:04:37.375
Dad!

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.291
Dad!

1:05:02.916 --> 1:05:03.958
Where are you going?

1:05:04.041 --> 1:05:05.291
I'm going to kill them!

1:05:13.041 --> 1:05:15.000
There are still so many of you.

1:05:20.291 --> 1:05:21.750
What a warm welcome.

1:05:27.708 --> 1:05:29.083
Disgusting!

1:05:29.166 --> 1:05:30.166
Let me see.

1:05:30.250 --> 1:05:31.541
Dead Man's Hand.

1:05:31.625 --> 1:05:33.458
Use the joker, dumbass.

1:05:42.916 --> 1:05:44.791
Take a good look.

1:05:55.916 --> 1:05:57.083
I'm underdressed.

1:06:18.500 --> 1:06:22.375
How powerful are these beasts of mine?

1:06:23.500 --> 1:06:24.833
Now I get it.

1:06:24.916 --> 1:06:27.375
Donghai's water vanished in a blink

1:06:27.458 --> 1:06:30.083
on account of these two guys.

1:06:33.250 --> 1:06:36.250
That's because I have their pup.

1:06:39.416 --> 1:06:41.875
They don't dare disobey.

1:06:45.791 --> 1:06:47.375
The surging East Sea

1:06:47.458 --> 1:06:51.166
draws on countless rivers,

1:06:51.250 --> 1:06:54.416
taking in even the narrowest streams.

1:06:54.500 --> 1:06:56.291
That's how it grows.

1:06:57.250 --> 1:06:58.541
Brilliant.

1:06:58.625 --> 1:06:59.916
So brilliant.

1:07:01.041 --> 1:07:02.625
I asked you to my humble home

1:07:02.708 --> 1:07:06.041
to ask about the progress of that favor.

1:07:07.041 --> 1:07:09.666
I've been busy, but I'm onto it.

1:07:10.916 --> 1:07:12.041
Really?

1:07:12.125 --> 1:07:15.083
I'm very curious about one thing.

1:07:15.166 --> 1:07:17.041
That brat has advanced so quickly

1:07:17.125 --> 1:07:18.875
that he even beat Yaksa.

1:07:19.916 --> 1:07:22.958
I wonder who trained him.

1:07:23.041 --> 1:07:27.083
Maybe his internal fire was so strong,
it just came naturally.

1:07:27.166 --> 1:07:28.125
Maybe.

1:07:30.375 --> 1:07:32.333
But maybe you taught him.

1:07:32.416 --> 1:07:33.666
Me?

1:07:33.750 --> 1:07:35.083
Why would I do that?

1:07:35.166 --> 1:07:37.208
-Impossible.
-Anything is possible.

1:07:37.291 --> 1:07:38.208
For instance,

1:07:38.291 --> 1:07:41.125
you fear I'll reveal your identity.

1:07:41.625 --> 1:07:44.375
So you want him to kill me

1:07:44.458 --> 1:07:46.208
and seal my lips.

1:07:49.916 --> 1:07:51.333
Six-Ears Macaque.

1:07:58.083 --> 1:08:00.000
It really is you, you demon.

1:08:00.083 --> 1:08:03.291
So Monkey King didn't really kill you.

1:08:04.166 --> 1:08:05.500
He really did.

1:08:06.041 --> 1:08:09.708
Now I'm just a nameless demon with a mask.

1:08:10.291 --> 1:08:11.375
Dragon King,

1:08:11.458 --> 1:08:14.583
these last few years,
Donghai's fresh water sources dried up.

1:08:14.666 --> 1:08:17.291
The river dragons in charge disappeared.

1:08:17.375 --> 1:08:18.750
What funny business…

1:08:18.833 --> 1:08:20.125
Six-Ears Macaque,

1:08:20.208 --> 1:08:21.958
those six ears

1:08:22.541 --> 1:08:25.250
really don't miss a single piece of news.

1:08:26.083 --> 1:08:28.208
There will be a new Order of the Gods!

1:08:28.291 --> 1:08:29.708
The Dragon Clan of East Sea

1:08:29.791 --> 1:08:33.166
won't have its tail trod on again
and be at the bottom of the Order.

1:08:33.833 --> 1:08:36.541
I need all that fresh water

1:08:36.625 --> 1:08:38.666
to enhance my powers

1:08:38.750 --> 1:08:42.625
and rule the new Order of the Gods.

1:08:42.708 --> 1:08:44.625
The Order of the Gods…

1:08:44.708 --> 1:08:46.000
That old nonsense.

1:08:46.083 --> 1:08:48.083
You have brought such suffering

1:08:48.166 --> 1:08:49.750
to the people of Donghai.

1:08:49.833 --> 1:08:51.041
Ao Guang.

1:08:51.125 --> 1:08:53.583
What if they sue you in Heaven's Court?

1:08:54.458 --> 1:08:56.333
It's chaos up there right now.

1:08:56.416 --> 1:08:58.125
No one has the time for it.

1:08:58.208 --> 1:09:00.875
Besides, who would take me to court?

1:09:01.458 --> 1:09:02.958
People are like grass.

1:09:03.041 --> 1:09:05.333
They need to be pruned well.

1:09:05.416 --> 1:09:08.416
If grass won't bend in the wind,

1:09:08.500 --> 1:09:11.791
I will mow it down.

1:09:12.375 --> 1:09:13.958
You're impressive and harsh!

1:09:14.041 --> 1:09:15.250
I'm not harsh.

1:09:15.333 --> 1:09:17.541
Why are they fighting for position?

1:09:17.625 --> 1:09:18.875
Fighting for position?

1:09:32.708 --> 1:09:35.041
So she is now working for you too.

1:09:35.125 --> 1:09:39.000
Nezha has enemies
well beyond the East Sea clans.

1:10:18.500 --> 1:10:21.208
Don't you see?
Even the red ribbons can't hold him.

1:10:51.666 --> 1:10:54.208
In the absence of the Dragon Pearl,

1:10:54.291 --> 1:10:56.416
we will retreat for now.

1:10:57.125 --> 1:10:58.291
Let's go.

1:11:02.958 --> 1:11:04.125
Useless.

1:11:14.958 --> 1:11:16.250
Dad.

1:11:17.583 --> 1:11:19.083
I…

1:11:20.291 --> 1:11:21.708
I'll stop him.

1:11:29.083 --> 1:11:30.166
My son,

1:11:30.750 --> 1:11:32.416
don't make me lose face.

1:11:36.916 --> 1:11:38.208
Nezha.

1:11:38.291 --> 1:11:39.541
This time,

1:11:39.625 --> 1:11:42.250
I won't humiliate myself
like I did in my past life.

1:11:43.833 --> 1:11:45.250
Come on.

1:11:45.333 --> 1:11:47.041
This will be a fight to the death.

1:11:47.125 --> 1:11:49.666
I won't back off.

1:11:50.875 --> 1:11:52.750
Prepare to die!

1:14:27.250 --> 1:14:28.083
Die!

1:14:41.166 --> 1:14:43.166
Ms. Cai Yun,

1:14:43.250 --> 1:14:45.375
ambushes aren't nice.

1:14:45.458 --> 1:14:46.375
Wait.

1:14:47.958 --> 1:14:50.166
-Are you talking to me?
-Who is she?

1:14:50.250 --> 1:14:52.625
Her? A disciple of Demoness Shiji.

1:14:52.708 --> 1:14:54.333
You are the kiss of death.

1:14:54.416 --> 1:14:56.250
You bring disaster wherever you go.

1:14:56.333 --> 1:14:59.166
-Disaster?
-You arrogant piece of work.

1:14:59.250 --> 1:15:01.500
Playing with your master's bow and arrow,

1:15:01.583 --> 1:15:06.666
you killed my sister-in-arms
from 1,000 miles away.

1:15:06.750 --> 1:15:08.875
You ripped out Third Prince's Dragon Spine

1:15:08.958 --> 1:15:12.250
and harmed Chentong's innocent people.

1:15:12.333 --> 1:15:14.083
Whatever incarnation you take,

1:15:14.166 --> 1:15:16.250
you hurt those closest to you.

1:15:16.333 --> 1:15:20.166
-You are the kiss of death.
-Nezha, you killed my son!

1:15:20.250 --> 1:15:23.083
I'll drown everyone in the town!

1:15:23.166 --> 1:15:26.458
Father, where are my Astras?
Where did you hide them?

1:15:26.541 --> 1:15:28.750
Apologize, Nezha!

1:15:28.833 --> 1:15:30.375
Give me back my Astras!

1:15:30.458 --> 1:15:33.791
-You are a bad seed!
-Nezha, you are a villain.

1:15:34.500 --> 1:15:35.625
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

1:15:36.458 --> 1:15:37.625
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

1:15:38.375 --> 1:15:39.833
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

1:15:40.666 --> 1:15:41.875
-Apologize!
-Apologize!

1:15:42.791 --> 1:15:47.041
-Apologize!
-If you don't, everyone will die!

1:15:47.125 --> 1:15:49.333
My son, stop it!

1:15:49.416 --> 1:15:50.666
It's not my fault!

1:15:50.750 --> 1:15:52.500
He needs to apologize!

1:15:52.583 --> 1:15:53.666
You!

1:15:54.625 --> 1:15:57.833
You are a bad seed.

1:16:09.291 --> 1:16:10.541
Dragon King,

1:16:12.291 --> 1:16:14.625
do you want me to apologize?

1:16:32.083 --> 1:16:33.666
-Go.
-What?

1:16:36.250 --> 1:16:37.500
Let her go.

1:16:40.291 --> 1:16:41.750
Go.

1:16:42.500 --> 1:16:43.958
He is letting you go.

1:16:45.708 --> 1:16:47.750
You will always be the kiss of death.

1:16:47.833 --> 1:16:49.500
Nothing can change that.

1:16:56.625 --> 1:16:58.125
If I'm the kiss of death,

1:16:59.750 --> 1:17:01.375
why are you helping me?

1:17:01.458 --> 1:17:03.250
I'm not helping you.

1:17:03.791 --> 1:17:05.708
I'm helping your ancestor.

1:17:06.541 --> 1:17:07.583
Nezha.

1:17:07.666 --> 1:17:11.250
An earlier one than that.

1:17:12.708 --> 1:17:14.500
We were leftover stones

1:17:14.583 --> 1:17:17.250
from when the Goddess Nüwa
patched the sky.

1:17:17.875 --> 1:17:18.750
You?

1:17:19.833 --> 1:17:21.458
Six-Ears Macaque?

1:17:26.250 --> 1:17:27.500
Actually,

1:17:30.375 --> 1:17:32.625
I am…

1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:55.500
Sun Wukong, the Monkey King!

1:17:56.125 --> 1:17:59.291
Back then, I saw how useless

1:17:59.375 --> 1:18:01.416
those Buddhist scriptures were.

1:18:01.500 --> 1:18:02.833
They can't cure

1:18:02.916 --> 1:18:05.083
the world's pain.

1:18:05.708 --> 1:18:07.041
But you, the Monkey King,

1:18:07.125 --> 1:18:09.250
proved your power in the Sky Palace.

1:18:09.333 --> 1:18:10.666
Where there's suffering,

1:18:10.750 --> 1:18:12.416
your Gold Cudgel could fight it.

1:18:12.500 --> 1:18:14.125
What would that do?

1:18:16.250 --> 1:18:18.416
Injustice is like the waves of the sea.

1:18:18.500 --> 1:18:20.875
It comes and goes, goes and comes.

1:18:20.958 --> 1:18:22.916
The stupid Order of the Gods.

1:18:23.000 --> 1:18:25.333
From order to chaos
and from chaos to order.

1:18:27.041 --> 1:18:29.083
I've been around for millennia.

1:18:29.166 --> 1:18:31.458
I couldn't change anything.

1:18:31.958 --> 1:18:35.041
I'm completely useless.

1:18:35.125 --> 1:18:36.666
You are the same.

1:18:36.750 --> 1:18:41.041
The Dragon King thinks
I'm hiding from enemies.

1:18:43.166 --> 1:18:44.291
I'm just tired.

1:18:45.250 --> 1:18:47.708
I don't even know
where I left my Gold Cudgel.

1:18:48.625 --> 1:18:49.916
Li Yunxiang,

1:18:50.916 --> 1:18:54.708
the red ribbon was your Astra.

1:18:54.791 --> 1:18:56.375
The Sky Ribbon.

1:18:59.916 --> 1:19:02.708
This hole leads to the East Sea.

1:19:02.791 --> 1:19:04.875
Under a waterfall at the bottom of the sea

1:19:04.958 --> 1:19:07.750
is a palace
of the Dragon King of East Sea.

1:19:07.833 --> 1:19:11.583
He keeps river dragons captive there,

1:19:11.666 --> 1:19:13.000
harnessing their strength

1:19:13.083 --> 1:19:16.083
to empower the Dragon Pearl.

1:19:16.166 --> 1:19:20.041
The thing about river dragons
is that they need fresh water to live.

1:19:20.708 --> 1:19:22.666
So he stole Donghai's water.

1:19:22.750 --> 1:19:23.791
Exactly.

1:19:25.208 --> 1:19:28.500
Nezha's Sky Ribbon is down there,

1:19:28.583 --> 1:19:30.791
tethering those dragons.

1:19:31.541 --> 1:19:33.583
It's too bad, Li Yunxiang.

1:19:33.666 --> 1:19:36.333
You can't do anything about it.

1:19:36.416 --> 1:19:38.666
You can't use the Sky Ribbon.

1:19:38.750 --> 1:19:40.416
You are not Nezha.

1:19:40.500 --> 1:19:41.833
I'm not?

1:19:41.916 --> 1:19:43.625
That kid behind you

1:19:43.708 --> 1:19:46.541
appears when you are murderous.

1:19:46.625 --> 1:19:49.166
But when you want to help people,

1:19:49.250 --> 1:19:51.458
the kid is nowhere to be seen.

1:19:51.541 --> 1:19:54.166
That scary, demon-killing,

1:19:54.250 --> 1:19:57.000
and death-defying Nezha.

1:19:57.083 --> 1:20:00.333
But where's the "soft heart"?

1:20:01.375 --> 1:20:03.041
You are not Nezha.

1:20:03.125 --> 1:20:05.625
You are not Nezha enough.

1:20:21.875 --> 1:20:22.958
Yunxiang,

1:20:23.041 --> 1:20:24.416
your brother woke up.

1:20:37.208 --> 1:20:38.250
Jinxiang.

1:20:40.083 --> 1:20:41.458
I'm so sorry.

1:20:43.208 --> 1:20:44.666
Why are you pretending?

1:20:44.750 --> 1:20:46.500
Six's death is on him as well.

1:20:47.125 --> 1:20:48.708
Who knows who is next?

1:20:50.083 --> 1:20:51.291
It's true.

1:20:51.375 --> 1:20:52.583
I'm so sorry.

1:20:52.666 --> 1:20:53.833
What use is that?

1:20:53.916 --> 1:20:55.250
You upset the De Clan.

1:20:55.333 --> 1:20:57.375
They're bound to make trouble for us.

1:20:57.458 --> 1:20:59.208
Look. Look around this room.

1:20:59.291 --> 1:21:01.833
There are dead
and wounded people everywhere.

1:21:01.916 --> 1:21:03.125
Isn't it all his fault?

1:21:03.208 --> 1:21:04.875
He is a walking disaster.

1:21:04.958 --> 1:21:07.708
-It was you who killed Six!
-Why are you still alive--

1:21:07.791 --> 1:21:10.416
-You are lying.
-I saw you kill Six myself!

1:21:10.500 --> 1:21:12.250
And you sabotaged Yunxiang's armor!

1:21:13.916 --> 1:21:16.041
So it was you.

1:21:17.666 --> 1:21:18.833
Don't move!

1:21:18.916 --> 1:21:21.666
Stand back!
One step forward and she is dead.

1:21:21.750 --> 1:21:24.250
All these deaths are all because of him.

1:21:24.833 --> 1:21:26.500
He just wants to be the big hero.

1:21:26.583 --> 1:21:28.250
But what about us?

1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:31.333
Kasha!

1:21:47.583 --> 1:21:51.125
Such a big world

1:21:55.583 --> 1:22:00.083
So many places

1:22:03.666 --> 1:22:07.875
A free spirit like me

1:22:09.166 --> 1:22:14.583
Could make memories anywhere

1:22:17.916 --> 1:22:22.791
But there's a place

1:22:24.125 --> 1:22:28.291
I cannot go

1:22:32.166 --> 1:22:34.791
-That place is home
-I can't change anything.

1:22:34.875 --> 1:22:37.125
Is it all useless?

1:22:39.083 --> 1:22:43.541
That place is home

1:23:30.583 --> 1:23:34.541
But young man

1:23:37.166 --> 1:23:40.708
Why are you hesitant?

1:23:44.041 --> 1:23:47.875
Flowers will bloom again

1:23:50.958 --> 1:23:56.208
Just as they fall every year

1:24:00.916 --> 1:24:03.375
Maybe nothing can be changed.

1:24:04.208 --> 1:24:06.166
It's like our patients in the hospital.

1:24:06.250 --> 1:24:09.166
Whether we cure them or not,
they will still die one day.

1:24:09.833 --> 1:24:11.583
But if they recover,

1:24:11.666 --> 1:24:14.333
they have more time in this world.

1:24:14.916 --> 1:24:17.791
I'm sure that this time

1:24:17.875 --> 1:24:19.833
isn't useless from their perspective,

1:24:20.500 --> 1:24:22.625
or that of their family and friends.

1:24:39.291 --> 1:24:41.458
Li Yunxiang, pull yourself together.

1:24:42.333 --> 1:24:45.083
I also think you are a hero
with a body of flame

1:24:45.166 --> 1:24:46.833
and boundless powers.

1:25:04.083 --> 1:25:06.125
I know what I have to do.

1:25:08.125 --> 1:25:11.416
I can't control the waves of the East Sea,

1:25:12.916 --> 1:25:15.166
but I can go down to the Dragon's palace

1:25:15.250 --> 1:25:17.125
to defeat the Dragon King

1:25:17.208 --> 1:25:18.583
and get back the water.

1:25:21.333 --> 1:25:23.750
So many people were born

1:25:23.833 --> 1:25:25.916
and lived in this world.

1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:27.666
The ones yet to be born

1:25:28.291 --> 1:25:29.791
should still be able to live.

1:25:31.083 --> 1:25:32.875
I'm doing this

1:25:32.958 --> 1:25:34.250
for them.

1:25:37.166 --> 1:25:38.375
That's enough for me.

1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:55.291
Come out, kid.

1:25:56.208 --> 1:25:57.583
We need to talk.

1:26:02.625 --> 1:26:04.166
Are you really me, kid?

1:26:04.833 --> 1:26:06.625
You look like a child,

1:26:07.291 --> 1:26:08.916
yet we are the same person?

1:26:10.208 --> 1:26:12.708
Listen, I'm going to save people.

1:26:12.791 --> 1:26:14.500
Not just one person,

1:26:15.083 --> 1:26:16.791
but the whole city.

1:26:16.875 --> 1:26:19.000
Anyway, you don't know them.

1:26:19.083 --> 1:26:21.375
It's a pretty lofty and abstract goal.

1:26:21.458 --> 1:26:23.541
I assume that eons of selfish behavior

1:26:23.625 --> 1:26:25.500
mean that you won't be helping me.

1:26:26.083 --> 1:26:28.541
So I, Li Yunxiang,

1:26:28.625 --> 1:26:30.000
will go on my own.

1:26:31.291 --> 1:26:33.666
The armor is a bit crude, but it'll do.

1:26:34.416 --> 1:26:35.916
I made it myself.

1:26:36.541 --> 1:26:39.458
You can just hide and leave me alone.

1:26:45.875 --> 1:26:48.791
Little punk.
He really went when I said, "Get lost."

1:29:34.833 --> 1:29:35.875
Thank you.

1:30:58.583 --> 1:31:01.625
You have really come to kill us all.

1:31:03.416 --> 1:31:04.750
There's no need to hurry.

1:31:04.833 --> 1:31:08.041
I have a special guest for you.

1:31:08.666 --> 1:31:09.791
Yunxiang!

1:31:22.500 --> 1:31:23.333
Yunxiang!

1:31:30.333 --> 1:31:31.333
Dr. Su!

1:31:34.541 --> 1:31:35.583
You are despicable.

1:31:37.541 --> 1:31:39.208
Woman, you are only here

1:31:39.291 --> 1:31:41.416
so I could mess with his head.

1:31:48.125 --> 1:31:48.958
Yunxiang!

1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:06.708
Do you think you can defeat me?

1:32:50.625 --> 1:32:51.875
Yunxiang!

1:33:01.125 --> 1:33:03.000
You meager ant.

1:33:03.083 --> 1:33:04.875
I should finish you off.

1:33:13.958 --> 1:33:16.875
-Apologize!
-Shady business never ends well.

1:33:16.958 --> 1:33:19.416
-You are a bad seed.
-You are the kiss of death.

1:33:19.500 --> 1:33:21.416
You bring disaster wherever you go.

1:33:21.500 --> 1:33:24.750
-All these deaths are all because of him.
-Who are these monsters?

1:33:24.833 --> 1:33:26.208
He is a walking disaster.

1:33:26.291 --> 1:33:27.625
-Yunxiang…
-Yunxiang.

1:33:27.708 --> 1:33:29.125
Li Yunxiang!

1:34:26.458 --> 1:34:27.291
Thank you.

1:34:32.500 --> 1:34:35.750
Do you think that's the end of it?

1:34:35.833 --> 1:34:39.041
I haven't wasted these 3,000 years.

1:34:39.125 --> 1:34:41.708
I've mastered the Tao of Transformation

1:34:41.791 --> 1:34:44.458
just for this day.

1:35:01.500 --> 1:35:02.750
Nezha,

1:35:02.833 --> 1:35:06.375
you are forcing me
to swallow the Dragon Pearl.

1:35:10.583 --> 1:35:14.541
This will unchain the river dragons.

1:35:14.625 --> 1:35:18.416
As they go,
they'll stir up a giant tsunami

1:35:18.500 --> 1:35:22.000
that will engulf
every living thing in Donghai.

1:35:22.583 --> 1:35:28.208
You will have hurt
countless innocents again.

1:37:34.458 --> 1:37:35.708
Hurry up!

1:37:38.083 --> 1:37:40.125
-Run!
-Be careful!

1:38:11.500 --> 1:38:12.625
Yunxiang.

1:38:22.958 --> 1:38:23.875
Kid,

1:38:24.583 --> 1:38:26.458
do you hear that noise?

1:38:27.291 --> 1:38:29.541
It's the sound of the tsunami.

1:38:30.625 --> 1:38:34.000
Donghai will be submerged.

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.416
You are an ordinary mortal.

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.041
Stop struggling.

1:38:44.625 --> 1:38:46.041
Relax.

1:38:46.125 --> 1:38:47.666
Give up.

1:38:48.750 --> 1:38:51.416
Your fate isn't in your hands.

1:38:51.500 --> 1:38:53.708
It's assigned by Heaven.

1:38:54.875 --> 1:38:57.458
Let Old Man Heaven

1:38:58.250 --> 1:39:00.458
take you back.

1:39:05.916 --> 1:39:07.291
Let me go.

1:39:07.958 --> 1:39:11.708
You are not Nezha.

1:39:17.041 --> 1:39:18.000
Tiger!

1:39:23.333 --> 1:39:24.333
Run!

1:39:35.458 --> 1:39:36.541
It's mine.

1:39:37.166 --> 1:39:38.708
This life that was given to me

1:39:39.500 --> 1:39:41.083
is mine.

1:39:44.583 --> 1:39:45.833
I don't need you

1:39:46.583 --> 1:39:48.500
to tell me

1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.166
who I am.

1:39:58.875 --> 1:40:02.541
I'll show you!

1:40:40.750 --> 1:40:42.125
You can't die.

1:40:44.083 --> 1:40:45.458
You can't die.

1:40:45.541 --> 1:40:47.125
You won't die.

1:40:48.708 --> 1:40:50.291
Aren't you Nezha?

1:40:53.500 --> 1:40:54.750
You won't die.

1:42:34.083 --> 1:42:35.166
Kid.

1:42:36.166 --> 1:42:37.541
We meet again.

1:42:41.666 --> 1:42:43.875
I thought you left.

1:42:44.541 --> 1:42:46.291
What are you doing here?

1:42:51.666 --> 1:42:53.375
I did my best.

1:42:56.833 --> 1:42:58.541
That tsunami…

1:42:59.541 --> 1:43:00.875
Donghai…

1:43:00.958 --> 1:43:02.958
All those people there,

1:43:03.458 --> 1:43:07.041
can you save them?

1:43:11.666 --> 1:43:12.791
Hey.

1:43:16.833 --> 1:43:18.083
You…

1:43:20.666 --> 1:43:23.375
should find your next incarnation.

1:46:04.791 --> 1:46:07.333
-The tsunami has receded.
-The tsunami has receded.

1:46:11.958 --> 1:46:14.500
-The tsunami has receded.
-The tsunami has receded.

1:46:14.583 --> 1:46:16.916
-Thank goodness!
-That's great!

1:46:17.708 --> 1:46:19.916
Ms. San, is this rain?

1:47:16.916 --> 1:47:18.458
I got my Astra back.

1:47:19.916 --> 1:47:21.375
I am Nezha.

1:47:27.041 --> 1:47:29.541
Don't forget to return the motorcycle.

1:47:29.625 --> 1:47:30.541
Thank you.

1:47:43.166 --> 1:47:45.125
He acquired the Sky Ribbon.

1:47:45.916 --> 1:47:48.541
There should be many other Nezha's Astras.

1:47:48.625 --> 1:47:49.750
Let's see.

1:47:50.291 --> 1:47:51.541
Cosmic Ring,

1:47:51.625 --> 1:47:53.291
Fire Wheel,

1:47:53.375 --> 1:47:54.625
and Dragon Catcher.

1:47:55.125 --> 1:47:57.583
What were the others?

1:47:57.666 --> 1:47:58.625
The others…

1:48:05.625 --> 1:48:07.500
In the moment of death,

1:48:08.583 --> 1:48:09.833
I became Nezha.

1:48:11.875 --> 1:48:14.000
-Because the first Nezha…
-Well, Yunxiang?

1:48:14.083 --> 1:48:15.583
…he was like this too.

1:48:16.375 --> 1:48:18.458
-Are you ready?
-He and I both know,

1:48:18.541 --> 1:48:19.875
in this world,

1:48:20.583 --> 1:48:22.750
-if you don't want to accept fate…
-What's this?

1:48:22.833 --> 1:48:24.958
-…you have to fight as hard as you can.
-So cute!

1:48:29.375 --> 1:48:32.500
In my dream

1:48:32.583 --> 1:48:36.083
There were you and me

1:48:36.166 --> 1:48:40.416
It never seemed real

1:48:40.500 --> 1:48:43.541
From the beginning

1:48:43.625 --> 1:48:46.041
When a true heart

1:48:46.125 --> 1:48:49.333
-This is my world.
-Can't betray the power of youth anymore

1:48:49.416 --> 1:48:50.958
This is our world.

1:48:51.041 --> 1:48:53.416
Tomorrow, today, and yesterday's fate

1:48:53.500 --> 1:48:54.833
I am Li Yunxiang.

1:48:54.916 --> 1:48:58.041
-Had been decided at that moment
-I am Nezha.

1:48:58.541 --> 1:49:01.833
NEW GODS: NEZHA REBORN

1:49:01.916 --> 1:49:04.833
How many souls are at war?

1:49:04.916 --> 1:49:08.166
After saying goodbye
To the confusing youth

1:49:09.125 --> 1:49:11.750
How many still hold onto dreams?

1:49:11.833 --> 1:49:15.791
The wind blew past the seasons

1:49:15.875 --> 1:49:19.208
Flowers bloomed and faded again

1:49:19.291 --> 1:49:22.750
The rain seeped into my heart

1:49:22.833 --> 1:49:25.833
Wandering in the vast sea of people

1:49:25.916 --> 1:49:29.333
A pure heart

1:49:29.416 --> 1:49:33.000
Spends the entire lifetime
Pursuing a dream

1:49:33.083 --> 1:49:36.375
A sincere person

1:49:36.458 --> 1:49:40.208
Is willing to end with a good dream

1:49:40.291 --> 1:49:44.541
One burns for his dream in this life

1:49:44.625 --> 1:49:47.666
It's what he yearns for in this life

1:49:47.750 --> 1:49:51.541
A dream comes true in this life

1:49:51.625 --> 1:49:58.000
It comes from what the heart wants

1:50:00.166 --> 1:50:07.166
STAY TUNED FOR POST-CREDITS SCENE

1:50:07.250 --> 1:50:14.250
STAY TUNED FOR POST-CREDITS SCENE

1:50:14.333 --> 1:50:18.833
STAY TUNED FOR POST-CREDITS SCENE

1:50:18.916 --> 1:50:23.541
STAY TUNED FOR POST-CREDITS SCENE

1:50:52.291 --> 1:50:56.125
Walking through a bustling city

1:50:56.208 --> 1:50:59.500
Slowly ignoring worldly affairs

1:50:59.583 --> 1:51:03.375
A sigh by the window

1:51:03.458 --> 1:51:06.833
Reveals whispered dreams in this life

1:51:06.916 --> 1:51:10.833
Pondering under the moon

1:51:10.916 --> 1:51:13.875
Who decides what happens in life?

1:51:13.958 --> 1:51:17.625
The loyal heart of a child is unstoppable

1:51:17.708 --> 1:51:21.583
Showing his ambition

1:51:21.666 --> 1:51:25.416
Yesterday's flowers

1:51:25.500 --> 1:51:29.000
Faded without regrets

1:51:29.083 --> 1:51:32.083
Fallen leaves have wilted

1:51:32.166 --> 1:51:35.583
Who else but me?

1:52:27.250 --> 1:52:29.500
MO LIQING

1:52:29.583 --> 1:52:31.375
AO BING

1:52:35.583 --> 1:52:39.416
ORDER OF THE GODS

1:52:45.125 --> 1:52:47.000
STAY TUNED FOR POST-CREDITS SCENE

1:52:47.083 --> 1:52:49.166
Such a big world

1:52:49.833 --> 1:52:52.125
So many places

1:52:52.833 --> 1:52:55.291
A free spirit like me

1:52:55.375 --> 1:52:57.958
Could linger anywhere

1:52:58.583 --> 1:53:00.958
Such a big world

1:53:01.583 --> 1:53:04.500
So many young men

1:53:04.583 --> 1:53:07.250
A free spirit like me

1:53:07.333 --> 1:53:10.458
Could find love anywhere

1:53:10.541 --> 1:53:12.708
There's a place

1:53:13.416 --> 1:53:15.458
I cannot go

1:53:16.333 --> 1:53:18.416
There's a young man

1:53:19.250 --> 1:53:21.458
I can't even say hello to

1:53:22.250 --> 1:53:24.500
That place is home

1:53:25.166 --> 1:53:27.458
That man is you

1:53:28.375 --> 1:53:31.125
But young man

1:53:31.208 --> 1:53:33.541
Why are you hesitant?

1:53:34.125 --> 1:53:36.625
Flowers will bloom again

1:53:36.708 --> 1:53:38.666
Youth comes only once

1:53:55.666 --> 1:53:59.458
It has always been this kind of world

1:54:01.333 --> 1:54:04.458
Same air

1:54:04.541 --> 1:54:08.083
Different fates

1:54:08.166 --> 1:54:11.000
Begin to feel

1:54:11.083 --> 1:54:16.083
Don't live in this kind of world

1:54:21.000 --> 1:54:23.750
Starting today

1:54:23.833 --> 1:54:29.583
We live in this kind of world

1:54:39.583 --> 1:54:41.333
Be who you are

1:54:44.333 --> 1:54:45.333
Verta.

1:54:46.041 --> 1:54:47.500
Blanca…

1:54:47.583 --> 1:54:49.875
THE WHITE SNAKE TEAM CONTINUES
THEIR DESTINY FROM THE PAST

1:54:49.958 --> 1:54:52.125
You'll be imprisoned forever
in Leifeng Pagoda!

1:54:52.208 --> 1:54:54.416
Verta, persevere.

1:54:54.500 --> 1:54:56.041
Blanca!

1:54:56.125 --> 1:54:59.708
Can you break what destiny binds together?
I'll kill you, you stinking monk!

1:54:59.791 --> 1:55:01.708
I'll send you to your next reincarnation!

1:55:26.041 --> 1:55:26.958
WHITE SNAKE 2

1:55:27.041 --> 1:55:28.958
DISASTER ENCOUNTERED
BY THE GREEN SNAKE

1:55:29.041 --> 1:55:30.083
COMING SOON IN 2021

1:55:48.500 --> 1:55:51.583
