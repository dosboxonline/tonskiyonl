[suspenseful music playing]

00:08.258 --> 00:10.260
[Michelle] You've been wasting away
in the basement.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.095
How would you like to be a night agent?

00:12.178 --> 00:13.013
Think he's our guy?

00:13.096 --> 00:14.931
He could be getting ready
to pass on more intel.

00:15.015 --> 00:15.890
-Recognize him?
-No.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.767
[Alice] I'll take the new guy,
you take Warren.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.270
[Peter] He just made a drop.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.354
[Alice] I'll come meet you.

00:29.154 --> 00:30.238
Alice, I'm made!

00:30.780 --> 00:31.990
Shit, me too!

00:32.574 --> 00:33.616
[Peter panting]

00:36.036 --> 00:36.953
Alice!

00:43.334 --> 00:44.544
[keyboard clacking]

00:44.627 --> 00:46.755
-Peter Sutherland?
-Still haven't located him.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.548
Figured out what went wrong in Bangkok?

00:48.631 --> 00:51.801
His training was accelerated.
He was pushed into the field too quickly.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.179
So you think Peter is the problem?

00:54.262 --> 00:56.056
-Who is this?
-I'm looking for Peter Sutherland.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.766
How… how do you know Peter?

00:57.849 --> 01:00.727
You got a call about Peter
from a man you didn't know.

01:00.810 --> 01:03.396
When we find Peter,
I'll let you know he's safe.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.440
Where are you?

01:06.232 --> 01:07.734
-[Peter] What's up?
-Stuff with my dad.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.487
-You haven't talked to him?
-[Ethan] He's talking to me on Signal.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.197
[Peter] Messenger app, right?

01:12.280 --> 01:13.406
[cell phone chiming]

01:20.705 --> 01:22.999
-Get on the ground!
-You need me alive, don't you?

02:23.810 --> 02:24.686
I'm Catherine.

02:26.020 --> 02:26.938
You my handler?

02:27.689 --> 02:29.190
Uh, case officer.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.777
We like to think night agents
can handle themselves.

02:32.861 --> 02:33.903
[Peter chuckling]

02:33.987 --> 02:35.321
Welcome to Thailand.

02:37.073 --> 02:40.285
-How was your processing in Germany?
-It was fine.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.412
I was there a lot longer
than I thought I'd be.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.497
Long enough to knock
that G-man look off you.

02:45.081 --> 02:48.209
Getting all those tattoos removed,
that can't have been pleasant.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.961
They didn't give me much of a choice.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.171
You read the briefing?

02:51.671 --> 02:53.882
What there was of it. When do I start?

02:54.591 --> 02:56.092
Well, first things first.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.930
There's credible evidence of a leak
in the CIA station here in Bangkok.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.600
The agency's internal investigation
yielded nothing,

03:03.683 --> 03:06.603
so our job is to find out
who it is and why

03:06.686 --> 03:09.522
without tipping off the spooks
that they're being investigated.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.773
Understood.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.693
Then maybe you also understand
why I'm a little bit skeptical

03:13.776 --> 03:16.404
in your ability to succeed
in Night Action.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.407
-I'm sorry?
-Analysis, okay. Logistics, fine.

03:19.490 --> 03:20.617
But field work?

03:21.618 --> 03:23.286
Even you know you're not ready for that.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.954
What is, uh, is happening?

03:25.038 --> 03:27.582
I'm giving you the chance to turn around

03:28.166 --> 03:30.084
and go and work for the FBI.

03:31.127 --> 03:33.671
You're here because POTUS
pushed you on us,

03:33.755 --> 03:35.715
not because you cleared
the proper channels,

03:35.798 --> 03:37.592
or cleared the usual hurdles.

03:37.675 --> 03:41.054
This job is going to ask a lot of you.
And it's okay to admit you're not ready.

03:41.721 --> 03:44.682
It takes a certain kind of person
to succeed as a night agent.

03:44.766 --> 03:48.102
There's no shame in quitting.
Actually, quite the opposite.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.563
It's better that you make that choice now

03:50.647 --> 03:52.774
than for me
to have to make it for you later.

03:54.525 --> 03:55.360
I can do this.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.695
[tense music playing]

04:06.079 --> 04:07.538
Peter, this is Alice.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.791
-Hi.
-Nice to finally have you here.

04:09.874 --> 04:12.877
She'll oversee your training
on this assignment, so follow her lead.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.379
Don't worry, I have a soft touch.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.172
I oversee agents in other countries,

04:16.256 --> 04:18.132
so I'll be in and out
to check on your progress,

04:18.216 --> 04:21.386
which means Alice decides
if and when you're ready for the field.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.596
-I thought that--
-I know what you thought.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.973
But training comes first.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.183
I'll leave you to it. Keep me up to speed.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.145
So this is it, huh?

04:31.646 --> 04:32.730
This is it.

04:32.814 --> 04:36.859
No field office, no central HQ,
no support staff, no footprint.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.612
We only exist here as if we're civilians.

04:39.696 --> 04:41.489
Oh, speaking of, let me see your phone.

04:45.243 --> 04:47.745
All right, my cell phone
is already programmed in.

04:47.829 --> 04:50.665
You memorized the local number
for the emergency Night Action line?

04:50.748 --> 04:51.582
-Yeah.
-Good.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.168
Under no circumstances
should that number be saved in that phone.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.922
In the U.S., we might be a rumor,
but out here, we don't exist.

04:58.006 --> 05:01.259
Can I actually save
some personal contacts before you--

05:01.342 --> 05:03.011
Is this about the Larkin girl?

05:03.678 --> 05:06.389
I read your file.
It's my job to know where you come from.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.057
-Don't take it the wrong way.
-It's fine.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.393
I just…
I said I'd call her if I could and--

05:10.476 --> 05:12.645
[Alice] Let me give you advice
I learned the hard way.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.147
You're a night agent now.

05:14.647 --> 05:16.316
Relationships are dangerous,

05:16.816 --> 05:20.695
even more so for normal people,
which we are not.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.907
I suggest, as of now,
no longer having any personal contacts.

05:25.658 --> 05:27.577
It's easier to just make a clean break.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.163
Any objections?

05:32.582 --> 05:33.708
No, ma'am.

05:33.791 --> 05:34.709
[water sploshing]

05:34.792 --> 05:35.626
[Alice] Hmm.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.045
Just Alice.

05:37.128 --> 05:39.172
-You can save the "ma'ams" for Catherine.
-Got it.

05:39.255 --> 05:41.966
I know she comes off
a little intimidating, but she does care,

05:42.050 --> 05:43.509
which is rare in this field.

05:44.093 --> 05:46.637
When you first joined,
did she try to talk you into quitting too?

05:46.721 --> 05:49.057
No. She recruited me.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.308
[both chuckling]

05:50.391 --> 05:52.685
We're gonna get you
where you need to go. Come on.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.642
Head down to the other end.
Get us a way out of here. Go.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.200
Wh… what are you doing?

08:12.283 --> 08:14.285
We need to get out of here.
Take us a few blocks up.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.871
-That's not how Uber works.
-You sure about that?

08:16.954 --> 08:18.331
[Rose panting]

08:18.414 --> 08:19.290
All right.

08:19.373 --> 08:20.625
-[Peter] Go. Come on.
-Go.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.597
[man] I'll live.

08:35.431 --> 08:36.682
You see where they went?

[tires screeching]

08:49.362 --> 08:50.279
[Peter] You okay?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.990
-I don't know. What just happened?
-I'll tell you at home.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.367
Where's home?

Listen, nobody can know
where I am right now.

09:37.743 --> 09:39.537
Okay. So you need to tell me
how you found me.

09:39.620 --> 09:41.038
[Rose] I found a picture online.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.834
You were in the background of some woman's
selfie in a rundown urgent care.

09:45.751 --> 09:48.838
-From there, I… I just did my thing.
-What do you mean, did your thing?

09:48.921 --> 09:52.466
I need to know exactly how you found me.
Okay? I need to know everything.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.635
I know, and I'm trying to tell you. I--

09:54.719 --> 09:56.345
I'm sorry. I just have to think.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.098
Someone just tried to kill us.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.433
Again.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.643
[car horns honking in distance]

10:03.269 --> 10:04.645
Peter, you're bleeding.

10:05.146 --> 10:05.980
Oh shit.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.191
-Do you need help?
-No, it's fine.

10:09.275 --> 10:10.860
It's just infected.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.321
That's why I was at that urgent care.
I needed antibiotics.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.198
[Rose] A woman there told me
about the shelter where you were staying.

10:16.282 --> 10:20.286
And then the guy at the shelter
told me about the basketball court.

10:20.369 --> 10:24.123
When I got to the court, I met this kid
whose phone you stole, apparently,

10:24.206 --> 10:26.667
and I tracked that number and found you.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.085
You tracked that number?

10:28.169 --> 10:30.087
No one else knows where you are.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.173
Okay. Thank you.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.759
[cell phone clattering]

10:34.842 --> 10:37.219
-I'm sorry.
-I get it. It's fine.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.640
So why'd you come after me?

10:40.723 --> 10:44.268
Because I haven't heard from you
in ten months.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.355
And then I get a call from a stranger
asking about you out of the blue,

10:47.438 --> 10:49.273
and it scared the shit out of me.

10:49.357 --> 10:51.525
-Uh, who… who called you?
-I don't know. A man.

10:51.609 --> 10:55.279
He said that you were in trouble
and that he wanted to help you.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.656
So I reached out to Travers,

10:56.739 --> 10:59.367
and this woman named Catherine turned up.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.285
She said that you work for her.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.995
-You talked to Catherine?
-Yes.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.497
-What'd she say?
-Nothing.

11:05.164 --> 11:09.377
She asked me a bunch of questions
that I didn't have the answers to, and…

11:09.460 --> 11:10.378
[inhales deeply]

11:10.461 --> 11:13.381
Look, Peter, I… I didn't know
if you were alive or dead.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.092
You wanna tell me what's going on?

11:17.843 --> 11:18.803
[Peter sighing]

11:20.721 --> 11:22.473
I can't get you involved in this.

11:22.556 --> 11:24.141
They called me looking for you.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.353
And a half hour ago,
they were shooting at us.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.188
I'm kind of involved.

11:30.272 --> 11:33.025
What happened to you, Peter?
Why did you take that kid's phone?

11:35.611 --> 11:36.862
[Peter] To track down him.

11:36.946 --> 11:39.323
That's Warren Stocker.
That's the kid's father.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.825
He's the key to all of this.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.284
All of what?

11:44.036 --> 11:45.454
What aren't you telling me?

11:48.374 --> 11:51.085
A month ago, the op I was on went bad.

11:51.168 --> 11:53.003
[tense music playing]

11:53.087 --> 11:54.714
It was just supposed to be surveillance.

11:54.797 --> 11:58.509
You know, identify who was leaking
CIA intel and find the buyer.

11:59.009 --> 12:02.555
But… I don't know.
Something else was going on.

12:02.638 --> 12:05.558
Because that guy that shot at us tonight,
he was there.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.769
Okay? And he ambushed us
at an extraction point

12:08.853 --> 12:11.480
that no one outside of Night Action
should've known about.

12:14.024 --> 12:15.735
He, um… he killed my partner.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.655
-My God. I'm… I'm sorry.
-I don't know if Catherine's involved.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.699
I don't know
if Night Action is compromised.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.242
And until I figure it out, I…

12:24.243 --> 12:26.328
I cannot trust anyone.

12:27.455 --> 12:28.873
Except me, right?

12:30.082 --> 12:32.084
[dramatic music playing]

12:34.170 --> 12:35.004
Except you.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.339
This cannot be like last time.

12:37.423 --> 12:38.257
[Rose sighing]

12:38.841 --> 12:40.801
I can't keep you safe, Rose.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.596
I didn't mean to get in the way. I was…

12:43.679 --> 12:45.222
I was just trying to help, okay?

12:47.349 --> 12:50.311
And honestly, if you hadn't been there,

12:51.270 --> 12:54.190
I probably wouldn't have seen
the other guy chasing me, so…

12:55.274 --> 12:57.902
So I kind of saved you in a way.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.988
[both chuckling]

13:01.655 --> 13:05.034
Let's get some rest. Okay?
We'll figure all this out in the morning.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.036
You take the bed, I'll take the couch.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.539
No, I… I can take the couch. It's fine.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.584
Rose, it's safer for you
behind another door.

13:15.836 --> 13:16.670
Right.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.009
-Hey, Rose?
-Yeah?

13:22.092 --> 13:23.969
[Peter] Next time
you go chasing after someone,

13:24.053 --> 13:25.971
don't wear heels.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.268
It's good to see you.

13:31.769 --> 13:32.645
Yeah, you too.

13:46.367 --> 13:49.245
[man in Farsi] You know how hard it is
to travel to Iran with two kids…

13:49.328 --> 13:53.249
It's not easy, but this year I'm trying
to take them up north for two weeks

13:53.332 --> 13:54.667
to see their grandmother.

13:54.750 --> 13:55.584
What about you?

13:55.668 --> 13:57.044
Here's the research you wanted.

13:57.127 --> 13:59.046
-Leave it on my desk.
-Of course.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.758
[man in Farsi] Her health is failing,
so we want to see her soon.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.718
-[man 2] Miss Taheri.
-Yes.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.137
The kitchen staff said they needed
an extra hand with something.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.931
I told them you would assist.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.349
-Of course.
-Thank you.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.433
[indistinct chatter]

14:14.687 --> 14:16.438
[in Farsi] In the name of God.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.607
One moment, attention, please.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.484
Thank you.

14:20.985 --> 14:26.574
Your behavior reflects
on this mission and on our country.

14:26.657 --> 14:31.912
So with the General Assembly
convening next week,

14:31.996 --> 14:35.624
I urge you all
to comport yourselves appropriately

14:35.708 --> 14:38.586
because we will be under a microscope.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.963
I also remind you that due to

14:41.463 --> 14:44.967
the Americans'
overinflated paranoia about Iran,

14:45.050 --> 14:49.763
all staff members of this mission
are confined to a strict perimeter

14:49.847 --> 14:52.057
within the city.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.060
Should you be found outside the perimeter,

14:55.144 --> 14:56.353
they will detain you

14:56.854 --> 15:02.484
for questioning and deportation.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.364
As some of you already know,

15:07.448 --> 15:12.244
Houshang had to return home
for a family emergency.

15:12.328 --> 15:18.584
So if you have any questions
about our security protocols,

15:18.667 --> 15:22.504
please consult Javad Rahmani.

15:22.588 --> 15:27.259
He's our new head of mission security.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.011
Thank you.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.096
[tense music playing]

15:31.180 --> 15:32.973
[indistinct chatter]

15:49.531 --> 15:53.494
[in Farsi] Noor,
let the cleaning staff handle that.

15:53.577 --> 15:54.787
[in Farsi] I don't mind.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.790
I actually think
the ambassador prefers the mess.

15:57.873 --> 16:01.251
It's fine. I'm used to cleaning up
after my little brother.

16:01.335 --> 16:04.505
But you aren't Abbas' sister.
You're his assistant.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.757
Don't make his other assistant look bad.

16:11.095 --> 16:14.723
I saw Javad noticing you.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.517
It's his job to keep eyes on us.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.559
Yeah.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.312
-Seemed like he only had eyes for you.
-Haleh.

16:20.396 --> 16:24.483
You're the only unmarried woman
in the mission.

16:24.566 --> 16:27.695
He has a good job, great hair.
He's a catch.

16:27.778 --> 16:28.946
I don't know him.

16:29.029 --> 16:30.698
So get to know him.

16:30.781 --> 16:34.368
You're a catch too. What's the harm?

16:37.162 --> 16:40.332
Haleh, when is the cut-off time to have
these cleaned and ready for tomorrow?

16:40.416 --> 16:42.167
[Haleh] Uh… One o'clock.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.253
One…

16:45.379 --> 16:46.547
Then you better go now.

16:46.630 --> 16:50.259
But we have a briefing in ten minutes.
I'm supposed to take notes.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.761
I can drop it off during my lunch.

16:53.470 --> 16:57.641
Thank you, Ms. Taheri.
I admire your initiative.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.728
Stop making me look bad.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.397
[contemplative music playing]

17:08.027 --> 17:08.986
[Peter gasping]

17:10.195 --> 17:11.697
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Relax.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.699
Nothing happened on your video feed.

17:13.782 --> 17:14.742
[Peter sighing]

17:15.492 --> 17:17.202
You shouldn't be looking at my stuff.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.830
Warren Stocker, right? I'm getting close.

17:19.913 --> 17:24.626
I mean, consumer-grade facial recognition
does bring back a lot of false positives,

17:24.710 --> 17:28.797
but I did manage to pick up
a couple of hits from the city,

17:28.881 --> 17:31.216
all from the past week.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.801
[Peter] Wait, holy shit. What is this?

17:32.885 --> 17:34.344
[Rose] I couldn't sleep last night.

17:34.428 --> 17:38.265
And whenever that happens, I, uh,
need to distract myself with something.

17:38.348 --> 17:42.061
So I thought I could help you
find your guy the same way I found you.

17:42.644 --> 17:46.482
If I could just recode the interface
to take in more search parameters at once.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.985
Interface of what? What the…
What the hell are you talking about, Rose?

17:50.069 --> 17:53.947
I'm helping code this new
marketing protocol called AdVerse.

17:54.031 --> 17:56.909
It can scrape the Internet
for any combination of search attributes.

17:56.992 --> 18:00.162
So, like, text, photos, locations,

18:00.245 --> 18:02.498
whatever you feed it
helps narrow the search.

18:03.248 --> 18:05.709
I started tweaking it
when I needed to find you.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.129
And here's the latest hit
on your guy from last night,

18:09.755 --> 18:11.548
now with embedded location data.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.300
Looks like he was headed back to the city.

18:13.383 --> 18:15.594
-Yeah, that's him.
-It's from a traffic cam.

18:15.677 --> 18:17.554
I have no idea where he went from there.

18:17.638 --> 18:21.016
Wait, so, whoa, hold on.
You didn't sleep at all last night?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.142
Not really. It's fine.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.772
That's as far as I got.

18:26.855 --> 18:30.859
The interface can only look at
publicly available, archived data.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.822
Like, old shit. A 12-hour delay at best.

18:35.405 --> 18:38.617
-Not even close to real time.
-I don't know, that's pretty cool.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.453
So this is your company, huh?
Is this what you're doing, now?

18:41.537 --> 18:43.872
[Rose] I wrote most of the code, but no.

18:46.083 --> 18:47.793
I'm just an employee.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.337
I thought you wanted
to start your own thing.

18:50.420 --> 18:53.465
Like do your own company and stuff.

18:53.966 --> 18:54.967
Yeah, well,

18:56.552 --> 18:58.595
there's a lot you missed in ten months.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.889
-[train rattling, screeching]
-[cup clanking]

19:03.392 --> 19:04.226
Listen…

19:06.061 --> 19:08.814
Rose, I… I wanted to call you.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.066
Oh, Peter, it's fine. We-- We don't--

19:11.150 --> 19:12.067
-No, it's not--
-No--

19:12.151 --> 19:13.193
It's not fine.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.529
[Rose sighing heavily]

19:16.113 --> 19:19.533
Okay? I'm sorry. I should have called you.

19:24.121 --> 19:27.499
I know what you're doing is important,
but now you need help.

19:27.583 --> 19:28.959
Yeah. [scoffing]

19:29.042 --> 19:32.546
If you knew you couldn't trust anyone,
why not reach out to Travers?

19:32.629 --> 19:35.883
Being a night agent, it's not like
answering the phone for them.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.928
Okay? I can't go to the President
until I get Warren

19:41.263 --> 19:43.724
and find out what intel
he was leaking to who,

19:43.807 --> 19:45.601
and who at Night Action is compromised.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.770
Because if it's Catherine,
she could be bad-mouthing me to POTUS.

19:48.854 --> 19:52.733
No, I need undeniable proof
before I go to her.

19:52.816 --> 19:56.153
What's it like, you know, uh,
being a night agent?

19:58.405 --> 20:01.158
I know how excited you were
getting on that plane.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.075
[Peter] Yeah.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.703
It's like being a rod bearing.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.039
-Okay.
-You're not the car.

20:07.122 --> 20:08.373
You're not even the engine.

20:08.457 --> 20:13.712
You're just a really, really small,
really important piece of the engine.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.090
And you can't fail.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.845
Because if you fail, everything around you
starts falling apart.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.139
And, uh…

20:25.557 --> 20:27.184
Yeah, you can't let that happen.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.940
Well, it looks like you're on
the right track.

20:33.023 --> 20:36.151
New York is one of the most
heavily surveilled cities in the country.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.695
-Warren will probably turn up again.
-We'll see.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.490
[Rose] Now, can I ask, is that his house?

20:41.573 --> 20:45.702
Or is that just a VHS tape
from the year 1995 playing on a loop?

20:45.786 --> 20:49.498
I don't really have access
to an FBI surveillance kit at the moment,

20:49.581 --> 20:50.749
so it's the best I got.

20:50.832 --> 20:53.585
So you bought some discount-bin cameras

20:53.669 --> 20:55.671
from the last remaining Radio Shack?
[chuckling]

20:55.754 --> 20:58.298
-Works, doesn't it?
-Yeah, I guess.

20:58.882 --> 21:03.136
[exhaling] No, that…
That townhouse used to be his,

21:03.220 --> 21:06.598
but he lost that
and custody of Ethan in a divorce.

21:06.682 --> 21:09.685
About a month ago, he had fake passports
made for him and his son.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.854
I think he's trying to take Ethan
and disappear.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.691
[Rose] So you know that Ethan's dad
is trying to take him,

21:15.774 --> 21:18.902
and instead of telling the police,
you're waiting for it to happen?

21:18.986 --> 21:21.989
He's the only lead I have.
I'll keep Ethan safe.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.491
Oh, something is up.

21:26.994 --> 21:30.205
[Peter] They're going to his basketball
game. Ethan's in the playoffs.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.166
-How do you know that?
-Started coaching Ethan at the park.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.168
Coaching him or pickpocketing him?

21:35.252 --> 21:36.712
I learned from the best.

21:37.504 --> 21:40.465
-Wait, where are you going?
-Warren might be trying to grab him.

21:40.549 --> 21:44.636
-You stay here, and then when I'm back--
-No, I'm not staying here by myself.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.888
[tense music playing]

21:46.972 --> 21:48.724
Didn't you hear anything I had to say?

21:48.807 --> 21:51.310
I cannot take you with me.
I can't protect you.

21:51.393 --> 21:55.188
And I can't be alone right now.
Besides, I can help, you know.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.901
Am I safer with you or alone?

22:01.695 --> 22:03.447
[suspenseful music playing]

22:03.530 --> 22:05.282
[train rattling]

22:10.662 --> 22:11.663
[van alarm chirping]

22:18.295 --> 22:19.296
[van door opening]

22:20.172 --> 22:21.173
[van door closing]

22:21.256 --> 22:22.424
[van engine starting]

22:35.687 --> 22:37.689
[indistinct chatter]

22:43.111 --> 22:45.072
Ethan. Ethan. Hey. Hey, buddy. Hey.

22:45.155 --> 22:46.114
What's going on?

22:48.283 --> 22:49.284
Should I go?

22:50.077 --> 22:53.246
-[Ethan] What happened to your face?
-Nothing. I just took a really bad fall.

22:53.330 --> 22:54.873
-It's good to see you, pal.
-You too.

22:54.956 --> 22:58.043
Okay, look, I know we talked about
meeting up a little bit later on,

22:58.126 --> 22:59.294
but some things have come up.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.755
We have to head out now
if we're gonna get time to see each other.

23:01.838 --> 23:04.299
-What about my game?
-We're gonna have to skip it.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.968
But it's really important
that we leave right now, okay?

23:07.052 --> 23:08.303
Yeah? Let's go. Come on.

23:08.387 --> 23:11.306
[man] Ethan?
You still in here? It's game time.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.349
Come on, let's go!

23:12.432 --> 23:13.725
Ethan, what are you do--

23:14.768 --> 23:16.895
Warren? What's going on?

23:16.978 --> 23:19.815
-Ethan, grab your coat. Wait outside.
-Hey, no, wait a minute.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.400
Go to your mom, Ethan, right now.

23:21.483 --> 23:24.486
I'm your father, not him.
Grab your coat and wait outside.

23:24.569 --> 23:25.821
I wanna talk to Frank.

23:26.696 --> 23:27.697
[locker latch clicking]

23:27.781 --> 23:29.491
[tense music playing]

23:30.283 --> 23:31.868
Hey, Ethan, don't. Just…

23:35.789 --> 23:37.374
[Warren breathing heavily]

23:37.457 --> 23:39.793
-He's not your kid.
-You're violating a court order.

23:39.876 --> 23:41.545
[Warren] You violated my goddamn marriage.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.964
You're fucking my wife
while I serve this country?

23:44.047 --> 23:46.466
You're living in my home with my son?

23:46.550 --> 23:48.051
You're lecturing me about what's right?

23:48.135 --> 23:50.011
How about what's right for Ethan?

23:51.430 --> 23:53.181
-[Warren straining]
-[Frank grunting]

23:53.265 --> 23:55.267
-[Warren grunting]
-[Frank yelping]

23:56.351 --> 23:58.687
[both grunting]

24:00.063 --> 24:02.065

-[sneakers squeaking]

24:05.026 --> 24:06.111
[whispering] Locker room.

24:14.327 --> 24:15.162
[Frank groaning]

24:15.245 --> 24:16.955
-[Peter] Oh shit.
-[Rose] Hey, I got him. Go.

24:17.038 --> 24:19.207
-Okay.
-Okay. Hey.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.836
[suspenseful music playing]

24:27.466 --> 24:29.468
-[kids clamoring]
-[sneakers squeaking]

24:36.183 --> 24:37.267
[door closing]

24:37.350 --> 24:38.477
[woman] What happened?

24:38.560 --> 24:40.562
It… it was Warren. He took Ethan.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.230
You have any idea
where Warren's taking him?

24:42.314 --> 24:44.274
David, what are you doing here?
Where's Ethan?

24:44.357 --> 24:46.109
Patricia, listen to me, okay? I'm FBI.

24:46.193 --> 24:48.487
It's important that you tell me
anything you might know

24:48.570 --> 24:50.238
about where Warren might be going.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.990
[Patricia] I don't know! [crying]

24:52.073 --> 24:55.535
Hey, look at me. My name's Rose,
and I'm gonna help you, okay?

24:55.619 --> 24:57.037
-You can handle it.
-What's going on?

24:57.120 --> 24:59.539
Warren's trying to flee with Ethan.
We can stop him if you help.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.708
He's trying to kidnap Ethan?
He's a lunatic.

25:01.791 --> 25:04.586
-We have to call the police.
-You should, but Warren has a head start.

25:04.669 --> 25:07.506
-Can you tell us about where he might go?
-I have no idea.

25:07.589 --> 25:11.051
When you were married, did he talk about
emergency scenarios, meet-up points?

25:11.134 --> 25:13.887
Sure. He said it was normal
in his line of work.

25:13.970 --> 25:15.889
Would you remember
where any of them are on a map?

25:15.972 --> 25:17.265
-Maybe some.
-You got something?

25:17.349 --> 25:20.352
He's gotta have a way out of the country.
We gotta narrow it down.

25:20.435 --> 25:22.395
I can sort the AdVerse results
by location.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.731
Maybe seeing where he's been
will tell us where he's going.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.274
Okay, here we go.

25:26.858 --> 25:28.527
Are any of these places familiar?

25:29.194 --> 25:30.654
That one, kind of.

25:30.737 --> 25:32.572
-Long Island?
-[Patricia] My parents live there.

25:32.656 --> 25:35.408
There's an old motel
in the middle of Farmingdale

25:35.492 --> 25:37.786
he said to go to
if anything ever happened.

25:37.869 --> 25:40.372
-What else is in the area?
-Private companies, mostly.

25:40.455 --> 25:42.874
There's a small airport, flight schools.

25:42.958 --> 25:44.834
-He's a pilot.
-My God!

25:44.918 --> 25:45.919
[Peter] We'll stop him.

25:46.002 --> 25:49.172
What you guys need to do is call
the police, tell them what happened.

25:49.256 --> 25:50.173
And then go home.

25:50.257 --> 25:52.467
Maybe Ethan got away
and he's trying to get back.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.180
[indistinct chatter]

26:18.118 --> 26:19.703
[suspenseful music playing]

26:37.804 --> 26:39.347
[door creaking]

27:03.204 --> 27:05.457
How long will it take
to arrange the paperwork?

27:05.540 --> 27:07.626
Let's just see if you got the goods here.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.547
Yeah, this is worthless.
I can't do anything with this.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.842
But I copied this directly
from our mission's files.

27:16.343 --> 27:18.845
It… it has details
of Iran's drone program.

27:18.928 --> 27:21.264
There's nothing in here
we haven't seen before.

27:22.974 --> 27:26.102
You said the CIA
would grant me and my family asylum

27:26.186 --> 27:27.437
if I gave you intelligence.

27:27.520 --> 27:29.648
First off, you came to us.

27:29.731 --> 27:31.983
And second,
we're interested in valuable intelligence.

27:32.067 --> 27:35.320
And without that, the CIA is under
no obligation to meet your demands.

27:35.987 --> 27:37.072
Sorry.

27:37.947 --> 27:41.242
Do you know what will happen to me
if I'm caught stealing from the mission?

27:41.326 --> 27:43.953
[man] Of course I know.
But that was your choice.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.456
You think you're the first foreigner
to promise us intelligence

27:46.539 --> 27:48.333
in exchange for some kind of a favor?

27:48.416 --> 27:50.752
-I've played this game before.
-This is not a game to me.

27:51.753 --> 27:54.381
[Noor] I only have one week
to get my brother out of Iran.

27:54.464 --> 27:55.965
And if I defect,

27:56.049 --> 27:59.761
I cannot leave him or my mother behind,
or they will face retaliation.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.806
Okay, look, we wanna help,
but you have to earn it.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.809
Still have that burner phone?

28:08.520 --> 28:10.897
All right, you come up with
something extraordinary,

28:10.980 --> 28:12.565
you know how to get a hold of me.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.612
The… the ambassador
has been having secret meetings

28:17.696 --> 28:19.781
with an American
in the intelligence community.

28:25.578 --> 28:26.496
You know this how?

28:27.455 --> 28:29.040
I heard a rumor at the mission.

28:29.124 --> 28:29.958
Rumor.

28:31.126 --> 28:34.337
If it's true, it means
you Americans may have a leak.

28:34.421 --> 28:37.132
If it's true, find proof.

28:38.675 --> 28:39.843
Then maybe we can help you.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.931
[officer] Anything else you can provide?

28:45.014 --> 28:47.016
[indistinct chatter]

28:49.769 --> 28:51.271
-Patricia?
-Yes?

28:51.354 --> 28:53.440
I'd like to talk to you
about your ex-husband.

28:53.523 --> 28:56.067
-Did you catch the psychotic prick?
-Who are you?

28:56.151 --> 28:57.152
I'm with the FBI.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.196
Have David and Rose found Ethan?

29:01.698 --> 29:03.450
-David and Rose?
-Your two agents.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.536
They were here after Warren took Ethan.
They went chasing after him.

29:09.247 --> 29:10.707
-Him?
-Yeah, David.

29:10.790 --> 29:12.167
Has he found my son?

29:15.378 --> 29:17.172
-Where's your phone?
-I don't have it.

29:17.672 --> 29:20.383
Are you positive?
I gotta make sure no one's tracking us.

29:20.467 --> 29:23.636
I don't know where it went.
It got mixed up with one of my friend's.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.346
-Yeah, what friend?
-David.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.015
The guy who's been coaching me.

29:27.098 --> 29:30.059
That guy's not your friend, okay?
That guy used you to get to me!

29:30.769 --> 29:32.020
To hurt me, you understand?

29:32.103 --> 29:34.105
-Where are we going?
-Someplace safe.

29:34.189 --> 29:35.273
Well, what about Mom?

29:35.356 --> 29:36.483
[tense music playing]

29:36.566 --> 29:37.400
[Warren sighing]

29:37.484 --> 29:40.069
Okay, uh, Mom, um…

29:41.279 --> 29:43.990
Look, I know that everything's
moving really fast right now,

29:44.073 --> 29:47.327
but it's gonna be okay. I'll explain
everything when we get out of here.

29:47.410 --> 29:50.497
[breathing heavily] You and me,
we're starting over, okay?

29:50.997 --> 29:52.624
Trust me. Yeah? Trust me?

29:52.707 --> 29:55.460
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. All right.

29:56.211 --> 29:59.047
Help! There's an emergency on the runway.
I… I need your help.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.298
-Stay.
-[Rose] Quick!

30:00.381 --> 30:01.216
What happened?

30:01.299 --> 30:03.426
My friend, she fell,
and she's unconscious,

30:03.510 --> 30:05.762
and there's no one around,
and I need your help.

30:05.845 --> 30:07.639
[both grunting]

30:07.722 --> 30:09.182
[suspenseful music playing]

30:09.265 --> 30:11.100
[Rose] Ethan, come with me.

30:11.184 --> 30:13.186
[both grunting]

30:16.773 --> 30:17.899
[Warren grunting]

30:17.982 --> 30:18.983
[Rose] Come on!

30:19.067 --> 30:20.193
[Warren yelling]

30:22.403 --> 30:23.822
[Warren] Get away from him!

30:24.614 --> 30:26.616
[both grunting]

30:35.583 --> 30:36.835
[container clattering]

30:36.918 --> 30:39.087
[both grunting]

30:41.089 --> 30:42.131
[Warren] Ethan!

30:44.175 --> 30:46.177
[Peter grunting, groaning]

30:47.762 --> 30:49.764
[both grunting]

30:53.434 --> 30:54.561
[Warren straining]

30:56.020 --> 30:56.896
[Peter gasping]

30:58.356 --> 31:00.358
[Warren straining]

31:01.442 --> 31:02.402
[Warren grunting]

31:02.485 --> 31:03.528
[Peter panting]

31:04.070 --> 31:05.655
[both grunting]

31:10.285 --> 31:11.411
[Warren yelling]

31:13.413 --> 31:16.082
[Warren groaning, gasping]

31:22.046 --> 31:24.048
[music fades]

31:26.259 --> 31:27.260
Ethan!

31:27.886 --> 31:29.888
[Ethan breathing heavily]

31:30.555 --> 31:32.015
What are you two doing with him?

31:32.098 --> 31:34.893
We're taking him home to his mom.
Taxi's on the way.

31:34.976 --> 31:37.896
-What are you doing with my dad?
-I work for the government.

31:38.396 --> 31:39.355
[Warren grunting]

31:40.231 --> 31:41.900
And your dad's done some bad things.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.485
No, Ethan. Don't listen to him.
Ethan, he's lying.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.446
Peter, he doesn't need to see any of this.

31:46.529 --> 31:49.115
Peter? Your name isn't David?

31:53.536 --> 31:55.914
Look, I know
this doesn't make any sense right now.

31:57.248 --> 32:00.919
And believe me, I know exactly
what you're going through, okay?

32:04.130 --> 32:04.964
I'm sorry.

32:06.007 --> 32:07.508
You don't deserve any of this.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.469
[dramatic music playing]

32:09.552 --> 32:11.220
[Warren] Wait, please. [grunting]

32:11.721 --> 32:13.097
Ethan, I can explain. Wait.

32:15.099 --> 32:16.100
Wait, wait, please.

32:17.352 --> 32:18.311
I love you!

32:28.029 --> 32:30.698
-[Rose] You sure you don't wanna talk?
-Just leave me alone.

32:32.617 --> 32:33.618
[Peter] Hey, Ethan.

32:36.704 --> 32:37.956
Hey. [panting]

32:39.415 --> 32:41.125
Your dad's going to be safe, okay?

32:42.377 --> 32:43.211
I promise.

32:47.256 --> 32:50.259
Hey, uh, excuse me.
Can you just wait a minute, please?

32:53.054 --> 32:56.599
Look, I'm sorry
that you got caught up in all this,

32:56.683 --> 33:01.312
but I couldn't have found Warren
without you, so thank you.

33:03.481 --> 33:04.649
What? What is it?

33:05.984 --> 33:09.529
Just don't ever stop being
the real Peter, okay?

33:11.155 --> 33:13.116
Don't do anything to him you'll regret.

33:14.117 --> 33:17.662
Everything in the van,
the apartment, it's not you.

33:19.956 --> 33:22.750
When I'm done here,
I'll come find you and explain everything.

33:24.127 --> 33:24.961
Okay.

33:25.545 --> 33:29.674
So after I drop Ethan home,
I'm gonna fly back to California.

33:32.093 --> 33:32.927
Good.

33:34.762 --> 33:35.763
Do me a favor.

33:35.847 --> 33:40.309
Get the night bus out of Chinatown, okay?
Go up to Boston, fly out of Logan Airport.

33:40.393 --> 33:41.811
It'll be safer that way.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.480
-What about you?
-I'll be fine.

33:45.732 --> 33:46.566
Okay.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.029
Be careful, okay?

33:53.114 --> 33:54.115
Yeah.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.563
[siren wailing in distance]

34:32.361 --> 34:34.363
[tense music playing]

34:59.388 --> 35:00.556
[light switch clicking]

35:08.439 --> 35:13.194
[drawer opening, closing]

35:13.820 --> 35:14.737
[mouse clicking]

35:20.368 --> 35:21.410
[knocking on door]

35:27.625 --> 35:29.377
[in Farsi] What are you doing here?

35:30.419 --> 35:31.879
[in Farsi] Just cleaning up.

35:33.506 --> 35:35.967
You're an aide here, yes?

35:36.050 --> 35:38.052
[Noor] Yes. Just a junior aide, actually.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.680
Trying to make a good impression
on the ambassador.

35:42.014 --> 35:44.767
I apologize if I kept you here late.

35:45.518 --> 35:46.644
I'm Noor.

35:47.854 --> 35:48.813
Javad.

35:51.482 --> 35:53.109
I've seen you.

35:54.527 --> 35:55.528
Excuse me?

35:55.611 --> 35:57.238
Where's your family from?

35:57.822 --> 35:58.656
Isfahan.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.324
Mine too.

36:00.908 --> 36:03.286
I grew up near Ghadir Garden.

36:04.453 --> 36:05.621
You did?

36:06.747 --> 36:09.208
I used to walk by there
on my way to school.

36:09.292 --> 36:11.919
There's a shop on the north side
that makes great zoolbia.

36:12.003 --> 36:13.546
-Maison Chai?
-Yes!

36:13.629 --> 36:15.423
[both chuckling]

36:15.506 --> 36:16.632
Wow, small world.

36:20.636 --> 36:23.890
I didn't think I would miss home much.

36:24.599 --> 36:29.312
But now that you mention it,
I could really go for some zoolbia.

36:29.395 --> 36:32.648
You can find any cuisine in New York.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.150
Even Persian food.

36:36.485 --> 36:37.987
I better put this away.

36:42.491 --> 36:45.328
May I walk you back to the residences?

36:45.912 --> 36:48.831
That's very kind of you.
But I don't want to trouble you.

36:48.915 --> 36:49.749
It's no trouble.

36:49.832 --> 36:52.668
Besides, American streets
aren't always safe,

36:52.752 --> 36:53.961
especially at night.

36:56.505 --> 36:57.590
I also don't mind waiting

36:57.673 --> 37:00.384
if you have other work
you need to finish first.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.262
All right then. Thank you.

37:03.930 --> 37:04.889
[Javad] You're welcome.

37:07.433 --> 37:08.601
[light switch clicking]

37:11.520 --> 37:13.522
[suspenseful music playing]

37:16.567 --> 37:18.611
Am I ever gonna get to see my son again?

37:28.537 --> 37:30.289
[indistinct chatter over radio]

37:30.373 --> 37:31.707
[cell phone ringing]

37:35.503 --> 37:36.921
-Hello?
-It's Director Gedney.

37:37.004 --> 37:39.090
I'm with Deputy Director Mosley
at his office.

37:39.173 --> 37:42.885
What fresh hell
has the FBI and CIA heads convening?

37:43.761 --> 37:44.595
Can't be good.

37:44.679 --> 37:48.140
The President wanted us to inform you
of a tip the CIA received today.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.351
An asset under development in New York

37:50.434 --> 37:52.770
approached us
about a U.S. intelligence leak.

37:53.396 --> 37:57.024
Seems the Iranians may have come
into possession of classified information.

37:57.108 --> 37:59.402
We think this could be related
to your case.

37:59.485 --> 38:01.112
POTUS wants to bring
Night Action in on it.

38:01.195 --> 38:05.283
You think Warren Stocker came back
to the city to sell intel to the Iranians?

38:05.366 --> 38:06.200
[Gedney] Unclear.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.827
We're trying to verify details.

38:07.910 --> 38:10.955
[Catherine] Returning to U.S. soil
to commit more crimes

38:11.038 --> 38:14.750
when you're already being hunted,
well, that's either stupid or stubborn.

38:15.334 --> 38:17.086
Who's the asset you're developing?

38:18.170 --> 38:19.422
[elevator chiming]

38:21.799 --> 38:22.883
[in Farsi] Thank you.

38:24.927 --> 38:26.679
No, don't visit Times Square.

38:27.471 --> 38:29.557
[in Farsi] But that's New York.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.684
It's a circus. Trust me.

38:32.351 --> 38:36.063
If you want to experience the city,
visit the bodegas.

38:36.564 --> 38:39.275
All kinds of people go there.
And they have everything.

38:40.026 --> 38:41.444
I'll take your word for it.

38:41.527 --> 38:43.529
[indistinct chatter]

38:48.159 --> 38:49.744
Thank you for walking me back.

38:49.827 --> 38:52.038
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.122
[Javad] Yes.

38:53.205 --> 38:54.290
And maybe during lunch,

38:54.373 --> 38:56.751
you can introduce me
to New York-style Persian food.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.589
I usually work through lunch.

39:02.298 --> 39:03.174
Of course.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.093
Well, good night.

39:06.719 --> 39:07.887
Good night.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.268
[keys jangling]

39:16.354 --> 39:17.229
[lock clicking]

39:17.313 --> 39:18.189
[Javad] Noor?

39:19.023 --> 39:19.857
[Noor] Yes?

39:22.360 --> 39:24.278
[Javad] You're not just an aide, you know.

39:25.821 --> 39:27.615
Your work is important.

39:29.575 --> 39:32.620
I'm sure your family is very proud of you.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.709
[dramatic music playing]

40:01.690 --> 40:02.608
[Rose] Hey, Ethan.

40:03.859 --> 40:05.319
Parents make mistakes, okay?

40:06.946 --> 40:09.448
They can make mistakes, but also love you.

40:18.374 --> 40:19.959
-[Ethan] Mom!
-[Patricia] Ethan!

40:29.552 --> 40:31.554
[inaudible]

40:37.601 --> 40:39.437
The Chinatown bus, please.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.438
[gears shifting]

40:57.580 --> 40:59.248
[in Farsi] Are you eating well?

40:59.331 --> 41:01.333
[Noor] Yes, Mom. Don't worry.

41:02.376 --> 41:05.254
You look pale.
Are you eating enough fruits?

41:05.337 --> 41:08.716
[Noor] I am. Want to see?

41:10.050 --> 41:10.926
Yes.

41:15.848 --> 41:16.682
Look.

41:18.058 --> 41:20.269
-Are those strawberries?
-Yes.

41:21.353 --> 41:23.147
They're huge!

41:23.230 --> 41:25.941
-How much did all that cost?
-Not much, really.

41:26.025 --> 41:28.402
You can find all kinds
of fruits and vegetables here,

41:28.486 --> 41:30.613
and they're not as expensive as back home.

41:30.696 --> 41:32.698
-Must be so nice.
-It is, Mom.

41:32.781 --> 41:34.492
I wish I could show you.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.452
[woman] I need to go stir the porridge.

41:36.535 --> 41:39.038
Farhad! Talk to your sister.

41:43.959 --> 41:45.753
[Noor] Good morning, brother.

41:47.796 --> 41:49.089
When are you coming home?

41:49.173 --> 41:50.758
So you miss me, huh?

41:50.841 --> 41:54.094
I miss having someone else
to help Mom with all the chores.

41:54.595 --> 41:55.429
[Noor] Fair.

41:56.972 --> 41:59.475
-Do you know what would be even better?
-What?

42:01.018 --> 42:03.187
[Noor] If you came to visit me,

42:03.270 --> 42:05.314
we'd have no chores.

42:05.397 --> 42:07.650
I'd take you around the city.

42:08.234 --> 42:09.485
That would be fun, right?

42:11.570 --> 42:12.446
Some day, maybe.

42:14.031 --> 42:15.741
Yes, maybe someday.

42:23.499 --> 42:25.000
[Peter breathing heavily]

42:25.084 --> 42:27.545
If you're gonna torture me,
just… [scoffing]

42:29.255 --> 42:31.924
My father sold state secrets too.
Did you know that?

42:33.425 --> 42:36.387
I didn't wanna believe it at first,
but it's true.

42:39.598 --> 42:40.766
You know why he did it?

42:42.017 --> 42:43.060
To provide for you.

42:44.228 --> 42:45.563
I'd like to believe that.

42:46.605 --> 42:49.024
But the real answer is I have no idea.

42:51.193 --> 42:54.405
What I do know is that he regretted it.

42:56.490 --> 43:00.202
And right before he died,
he decided to do the right thing.

43:00.786 --> 43:01.954
Now, I get it.

43:02.037 --> 43:05.791
I understand why someone would sacrifice
everything for their family.

43:07.668 --> 43:10.379
I admire it, even. I do.

43:10.963 --> 43:13.132
And if that's the reason
my dad did what he did,

43:13.632 --> 43:15.467
then I might be able to forgive him.

43:16.594 --> 43:17.970
Now, listen.

43:18.971 --> 43:24.143
I don't know when, or even if,
that you'll ever get to see Ethan again.

43:26.145 --> 43:28.689
But I can give him some clarity
about his father.

43:30.190 --> 43:31.817
I'm not gonna torture you.

43:32.610 --> 43:35.070
Okay? I'm not gonna kill you.
That's not who I am.

43:35.154 --> 43:36.196
[Warren sighing]

43:37.114 --> 43:41.243
If you don't tell me what I wanna know,
I'm just gonna give you to the FBI.

43:42.244 --> 43:44.038
Okay. They're gonna charge you
for treason,

43:44.121 --> 43:46.665
then they'll rewrite
the entire narrative of your life.

43:46.749 --> 43:50.753
And whatever it is that they decide
to tell Ethan about you…

43:53.464 --> 43:54.757
that's all he's ever gonna know.

43:56.008 --> 43:58.636
Or you can answer my questions

43:59.261 --> 44:00.638
honestly and promptly,

44:01.847 --> 44:03.390
and I'll explain to Ethan.

44:04.308 --> 44:05.768
Okay? I will, I promise.

44:06.810 --> 44:10.147
I'll explain to him that his father
did the right thing in the end.

44:11.774 --> 44:12.608
Okay?

44:12.691 --> 44:16.070
I'll make sure, personally,
that he understands

44:16.153 --> 44:17.780
that his father had a good side.

44:19.406 --> 44:21.241
And that's something that I never got.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.327
[Warren breathing heavily]

44:26.413 --> 44:28.457
-What do you wanna know?
-Bangkok.

44:29.333 --> 44:31.877
What was the intel you were passing on?
Who were you selling it to?

44:33.837 --> 44:34.922
[Warren sighing]

44:37.549 --> 44:38.884
He said his name was Arthur.

44:39.510 --> 44:41.428
Okay? But it had to be an alias.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.682
And I got the feeling
he wasn't the actual buyer.

44:44.765 --> 44:46.433
He… he was more like the middleman.

44:46.517 --> 44:49.561
There was another man at the drop.
He sort of stood out.

44:49.645 --> 44:51.730
Beard, white suit, no tie.

44:51.814 --> 44:54.191
He was watching the whole thing,
the handoff. Who was he?

44:54.274 --> 44:58.487
I don't know. I only traded with Arthur.
I had no idea who he was working with.

44:59.738 --> 45:00.823
Hey, why would I lie?

45:00.906 --> 45:02.908
Huh? Why would I lie now?

45:04.493 --> 45:05.577
Let's find out.

45:06.870 --> 45:08.622
Who compromised the Night Action line?

45:09.289 --> 45:12.209
Who's the fucking mole
that got my partner killed?

45:12.292 --> 45:14.086
I don't know. What's a Night Action?

45:15.379 --> 45:18.340
Look, I was working alone. All right?

45:18.424 --> 45:20.050
[Warren breathing heavily]

45:20.134 --> 45:23.095
I needed to get Ethan
away from Patricia and that…

45:24.722 --> 45:25.681
asshole, Frank.

45:26.682 --> 45:29.435
When I started working overseas,
I begged Patricia to come with me.

45:29.518 --> 45:31.270
She said we couldn't pull Ethan
out of school.

45:31.353 --> 45:33.397
So… so I went by myself.

45:34.106 --> 45:38.360
Then she started having an affair
with that… that… that shitbag architect.

45:38.444 --> 45:41.155
Ended up divorcing me.
Then I fucking lose custody?

45:41.238 --> 45:42.740
-I mean--
-[Peter] Okay, okay.

45:43.824 --> 45:46.660
Bangkok. What intel were you selling?

45:50.539 --> 45:54.710
There was a covert military program
initiated at the behest of the CIA.

45:55.753 --> 45:57.963
The file I sold was from
the early stages of development.

45:58.046 --> 46:01.467
It was theoretical shit, okay?
Nothing serious.

46:01.550 --> 46:03.469
The whole program was shuttered years ago.

46:03.552 --> 46:04.386
What program?

46:04.470 --> 46:06.221
It was called Foxglove.

46:06.305 --> 46:08.682
It dealt with experimental weapons
that were mostly chemical--

46:08.766 --> 46:09.975
[gun firing]

46:10.058 --> 46:11.435
[suspenseful music playing]

46:12.186 --> 46:13.645
[chair clattering]

46:14.980 --> 46:17.316
[Peter breathing heavily]

46:19.276 --> 46:21.278
[shutter thudding]

46:24.406 --> 46:25.699
[shutter thudding loudly]

46:28.786 --> 46:30.120
[cell phone ringing]

46:31.455 --> 46:33.457
[sinister music playing]

46:39.838 --> 46:40.756
[cell phone stops]

46:46.136 --> 46:48.138
[indistinct chatter]

46:57.981 --> 46:59.858
[cell phone ringing]

47:02.486 --> 47:04.363
[Peter panting]

47:08.826 --> 47:10.828
[suspenseful music swelling]

47:14.164 --> 47:15.916
[cell phone continues ringing]

47:24.883 --> 47:25.717
Hello?

47:25.801 --> 47:27.803
[dramatic sting playing]

47:28.762 --> 47:30.764
[ending theme music playing]

49:30.884 --> 49:32.803
[theme music ends]
